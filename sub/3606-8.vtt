00:00.634 --> 00:04.336
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:07.873
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.908
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:09.910 --> 00:11.677
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.679 --> 00:15.514
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become Superman.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.349
<i> And so I hide my powers,</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:22.087
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.089 --> 00:25.624
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at Catco Worldwide Media.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:29.595
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.096
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.098 --> 00:33.632
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.169 --> 00:37.803
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:39.538
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:39.540 --> 00:40.873
Alex: <i> You may have powers,</i>

00:40.875 --> 00:42.741
but so do most of
the fort rozz aliens.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.577
<i> They've also had time</i>
<i> to master their abilities.</i>

00:45.579 --> 00:46.979
Aunt astra. You died.

00:46.981 --> 00:48.614
I was a prisoner
aboard fort rozz.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.149
Hank henshaw: I made
your father a promise,

00:50.151 --> 00:52.885
that I would take care
of his daughter.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.821
My name
is j'onn j'onzz.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.800
Astra.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.268
Astra: My dear niece.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.743
Did you really think
this was over?

01:21.182 --> 01:22.915
(Grunting)

01:32.560 --> 01:33.792
Why doesn't
kryptonite hurt you?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.594
Kryptonite? (Chuckles)

01:35.596 --> 01:37.029
Is that what you call it?

01:37.031 --> 01:39.331
It's just like any other
dangerous substance.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.366
(Grunts)

01:41.368 --> 01:44.670
Shield yourself
in the right materials
and it becomes harmless.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.673
Afraid of a fair fight?

01:47.675 --> 01:50.776
I don't want
to fight you, Kara.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.378
I've been blaming
you for things that
happened a long...

01:53.380 --> 01:54.813
Don't touch me!

01:57.485 --> 02:00.152
Your mother always said
you had the heart of a hero.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.690
I need for you
to be a hero, Kara.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.458
It's time for us
to be a family again.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.460
You're not my family.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.296
-I know you hate me.
-Good.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.298
We understand each other.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.742
She's gone, general.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.649
Astra's back
and she's up to something.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.918
And she has your
kryptonite knife.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.720
You didn't get that back
by any chance?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.322
-I really like that knife.
-Wait a minute.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.491
So the kryptonite
wasn't affecting her?

02:39.493 --> 02:42.161
-How can that be?
-Oh, that's more awesome news.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.430
She has created a suit that
makes her invulnerable to it.

02:45.432 --> 02:46.999
That changes the game.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.700
Why'd she attack you now,
after all this time?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.336
She's recruiting me
for her crazy cause,
whatever it is.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.007
She said earth needs
both of us.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.176
But according to
the a.I. Of my mother,

02:57.178 --> 03:01.446
astra's idea of helping people
on Krypton was blowing up
government buildings, so...

03:01.448 --> 03:03.215
She wants you off the board.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.017
This could be the beginning
of what we've feared

03:05.019 --> 03:07.019
since fort rozz
first crashed on earth,

03:07.021 --> 03:08.854
a city-wide attack.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.922
I'll head out now.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.423
No, wait a minute.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.926
You need at least a few hours
of rest to recover.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.628
Now is not the time
to big sister me, okay?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.698
You're no good to anyone
if you go out there weakened
and she kills you.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.434
Go home. Sleep.
Knock her on her ass
another day.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.436
Will you stop handling me?

03:24.438 --> 03:28.106
-It's my job to stop her...
-No. It's not.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.942
It's Hank's.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.245
Tomorrow.
Come in and we'll spar

03:33.247 --> 03:35.113
to make sure
you're ready, okay?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.721
You two seem pretty chummy.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.256
(Sighs) We were
wrong about Hank.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.458
He didn't have anything
to do with my dad's death.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.062
-How do you know?
-Just... I do. Trust me.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.496
Fine.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.733
Ugh, I hope it's a slow day
at work tomorrow.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.403
Woman: (On TV) <i> In what is</i>
<i> being described as</i>
<i> a vicious cyber attack,</i>

03:58.405 --> 04:03.642
<i> cat Grant, founder and ceo</i>
<i> of catco worldwide media,</i>
<i> has been hacked.</i>

04:03.644 --> 04:07.346
Man: (On TV) <i> Cat Grant has</i>
<i> been unavailable for comment,</i>
<i> but how long...</i>

04:07.348 --> 04:10.415
Lawyer: So far, nobody's
made any demands,
which leads us to think

04:10.417 --> 04:14.019
that whoever did this
simply wanted
to embarrass you.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.521
Well...

04:17.758 --> 04:20.759
Mission accomplished.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.762
In the last hour alone,
the <i> daily planet</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:25.430
has published my real age,

04:25.432 --> 04:29.034
the fact that I have
three personal shoppers
on-call at barneys

04:29.036 --> 04:33.005
and that I asked out
idris elba on a date
and he said no.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.674
His loss.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.110
So, you're my lawyers.

04:38.112 --> 04:41.713
Can't we just sue every
outlet that's publishing
these e-mails?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.283
We can try,
but it's a process.

04:44.285 --> 04:48.520
Imagine if someone dumped
all of Lois Lane's personal
e-mails into your lap,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.888
wouldn't you publish them?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.224
Only if I wanted
people to die of boredom.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.959
Due respect, Ms. Grant,

04:53.961 --> 04:56.028
you are the very
public face of catco.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.497
The entire company's been
embarrassed by this incident.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.198
Don't make it worse.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.311
I am sure this is all going
to blow over, Ms. Grant.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.979
What planet are you from?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.481
Um, this one.

05:16.483 --> 05:20.052
Stories like this
do not blow over.
They blow up.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.554
Then you have to fight.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.022
No matter what
the lawyers say.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.158
I would, but I don't know
who I'm fighting.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.559
I need to get ahead of this.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.061
Schedule a meeting
with the board.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.229
And also, go through every
single one of my e-mails

05:31.231 --> 05:33.832
and flag anything that
can be used against me.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.200
If there is something damning,

05:35.202 --> 05:37.436
I want to find it
before the world does.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.072
All your e-mails? Like, ever?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.275
I... I may need help.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.677
Fine. Go. Wait.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.014
Only people
you trust on this one.

05:49.016 --> 05:54.186
James Olsen and that
handsome little hobbit who has
more cardigans than you do.

06:02.396 --> 06:06.898
Here are Ms. Grant's
e-mails from the server,
printed out.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.202
Ugh! So much evil
in three-hole punch form.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.071
The <i> planet</i> just posted
another batch of e-mails.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.875
Oh, man, look what
cat is spending
every month on a haircut.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.910
That's more than my rent.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.612
And she used
the corporate jet...

06:20.614 --> 06:21.880
Which is hers!

06:21.882 --> 06:23.148
...to fly to
burning man last year.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.883
Gross. I know
what happens there.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.718
Okay, so James and I
will read the e-mails

06:26.720 --> 06:28.720
and, winn,
can you trace the hack?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.622
No one knows the
computer systems
better than you.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.391
You speak the truth, danvers.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.727
But, uh, really,
shouldn't we be, uh,
focusing on the whole,

06:35.729 --> 06:38.630
"psycho-aunt-
astra's-back-in-town-
for-round-two" thing?

06:39.366 --> 06:40.665
Is that true?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.502
Why didn't you tell me?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.604
Oh, I know something
before you do.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.406
The deo is handling that.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.507
We're saving Ms. Grant.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.410
Okay. I'll, uh,
do some digging.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.844
You're in my way.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.181
I meant, excuse me.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.922
-He's acting weird.
-He's being winn.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.258
Ever since he saw us hug...

07:06.260 --> 07:08.160
Which was just a hug.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.929
A friendly hug.
We are friends who hug.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.098
-Nothing more.
-Nothing more?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.268
-Because you're with Lucy.
-Yeah, I'm with Lucy.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.675
Non: You didn't kill her.

07:23.677 --> 07:28.814
You swore to me
alura's daughter would
convert to our cause or die.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.116
It's not like you to fail
to keep a promise.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.219
I told you, she's stronger
than we thought.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.556
Was it her strength
or your weakness?

07:37.558 --> 07:41.693
You owe alura nothing.
Certainly not
her daughter's life.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.295
Alura is not her mother.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.831
She can be made to see reason.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.300
I sometimes wonder
if any of the women
in your family can.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.402
You forget yourself,
lieutenant.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.205
I am your general.

07:53.207 --> 07:57.843
I have sworn my allegiance
to you in every way possible.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.412
I obey your orders
and your heart.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.147
If you cannot bring
yourself to kill her,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.883
there is no shame
and I do not judge.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.653
But let me end her
and be done with it.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.323
Do not question
my resolve, non.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.992
I will see this through.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.430
I will die before I allow
another world to end
when I could save it.

08:18.432 --> 08:21.399
If you die, she dies.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.404
And I always keep
my promises, wife.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.514
(Kara grunting)

08:38.685 --> 08:39.784
Again.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.865
(Exhales) Again.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.754
-(Grunts)
-(Groaning)

09:20.093 --> 09:21.560
(Groans)

09:23.997 --> 09:25.430
(Panting) Again.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.165
Why did you hesitate?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.067
We're just training.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.402
And you're my sister.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.736
What if I wasn't?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.410
What is going on with you?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.412
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.147
I think you should
let us handle this.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.282
Don't give me
that line you've been
giving me for months.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.984
This isn't about being ready.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.688
Astra is your family.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.925
And I think, deep down,
whether you want
to admit it or not,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.093
you still care about her.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.130
-I don't.
-Kara, this is war.

09:59.132 --> 10:03.101
And to win a war,
sometimes the enemy
has to die.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.304
Now, can you look me
in the eye and tell me that
you're prepared to kill?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.642
Superman doesn't kill.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.611
If that's your answer,
then you shouldn't fight her.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.845
It won't come to that.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.882
She has shown that
she's ready to kill you.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.619
You have to be ready
to do the same.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.225
What do you
remember about her?

10:27.227 --> 10:28.827
What are you holding on to?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.895
Nothing. It's gone.

10:41.241 --> 10:45.243
-Astra: Kara.
-Aunt astra!
You got my message!

10:45.245 --> 10:47.812
I would never lose track
of my spy beacon.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.485
Where have you been?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.488
Mother said you were
never coming back.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.223
Are you in trouble?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.158
We all are, little one.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.994
Why? Tell me.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.496
No one else will tell me.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.498
Krypton is dying.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Our core is unstable.

11:08.502 --> 11:12.070
It has been for a long time
because of how we've
harnessed it for power.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.838
We became greedy.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.875
And now the oceans
have changed,
and the weather.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.511
I'm trying to get
people to stop

11:19.513 --> 11:21.346
and see what they're doing,

11:21.348 --> 11:25.950
and in doing so,
I've had to do
some difficult things.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.853
Is that why mother won't say
your name anymore?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.959
I would do anything
to save us.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.095
To save you, Kara.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.965
But it isn't safe here
for me anymore.
I have to go away again.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.301
But I didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.036
Please don't leave.

11:48.675 --> 11:53.812
I couldn't love a daughter
more than if rao had granted
me a child of my own.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.726
Kara, leave us.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.761
-Mother...
-Now, Kara.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.738
Hey, everything okay?

12:19.740 --> 12:22.173
Fine. Any luck
tracing the hack?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.608
Uh, not yet.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.677
I helped build
catco's firewalls,

12:25.679 --> 12:28.680
and so far, there's no signs
of any malware or overrides,
nothing is out of place.

12:28.682 --> 12:30.749
Okay, and what about
Ms. Grant's e-mails?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.851
-All over the map.
-How bad is it?

12:32.853 --> 12:37.122
I mean, I'm compiling
a master list but it's always
this strange, weird stuff

12:37.124 --> 12:41.860
like the fact that cat
invested in
<i> Jekyll and Hyde musical.</i>

12:41.862 --> 12:45.530
(Scoffs) I still maintain that
it was an excellent score.

12:45.532 --> 12:50.935
Has she sent in
an audition tape to be
on <i> undercover boss?</i>

12:50.937 --> 12:54.939
Years ago, and only because
Anderson Cooper dared me to.

12:54.941 --> 13:00.178
And there are 317 e-mails
referring to Lois Lane as a...

13:00.180 --> 13:04.449
Oh, please. I call her that
to her face and worse.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.651
-Is that it?
-For the moment.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.488
Well, if that's the worst
people might read about me,
then I'm golden.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.191
The factoids
couldn't be more benign.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.628
The board has to understand
that people get hacked.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.962
It happens.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.665
In some circles,
it's a badge of honor.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.535
It was bound to happen
to one of us eventually,

13:23.537 --> 13:26.504
and in a way,
thank god it was me.

13:26.506 --> 13:30.975
This hack is painting
a rather unflattering
picture of you, cat.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.211
You don't build a company like
catco by being a wallflower

13:33.213 --> 13:35.980
and not having an opinion
and a strong point of view.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.483
Yes, but devil's
advocate here...

13:38.485 --> 13:41.719
I, uh, I agree with cat.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.389
I think we should
follow her lead on this.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.825
Oh, thank you, dirk.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.361
And, ahem,
about that one e-mail...

13:50.363 --> 13:55.900
The one where you said I was
the walking personification
of white male privilege?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.836
Mmm. (Chuckles)

13:57.838 --> 14:01.573
Well, obviously you're more
of an Ally than I thought.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.775
Maybe you could
take a sabbatical.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.177
Put some distance between
you and the company?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.413
My company, you mean?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.349
I don't think,
at this point,
that's necessary.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.420
I mean,
if there is a smoking gun,
the press is yet to find it.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.688
Maybe they never will.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.691
No, I, uh, trust
cat's judgment.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.727
Besides, if, uh,
well, if things get too hot,

14:22.729 --> 14:26.698
I'm sure that you'll be
the first one to step away.
Right, cat?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.233
Absolutely.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.207
Ms. Grant? Did it go well?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.042
They all smell
blood in the water.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.578
Keep going
through my e-mails.
No stone unturned.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.115
Whatever the press turns up,
dirk Armstrong is going
to pounce all over it.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.584
He's as two-faced
as they come.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.894
Oh, we have opened
the floodgates

14:55.896 --> 14:57.495
and the press
is gonna do the rest.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.898
I think she'll be out by
the end of the week.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.634
-Kara: Oh, my gosh.
-What?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.472
I... I forgot to put
your lunch order in.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.107
Does Cobb salad sound good?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.174
Delish.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.078
(Sighs)

15:18.118 --> 15:19.951
It was dirk Armstrong,
chairman of the board.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.253
He hired someone
to hack Ms. Grant.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.255
-How do you know that?
-I overheard him after
the board meeting,

15:24.257 --> 15:27.258
talking about setting up
Ms. Grant for a fall.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.927
You overheard him?

15:28.929 --> 15:32.530
Yes, with...
With my alien ears.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.301
Okay, um, if the hack
was ordered by
someone inside catco,

15:36.303 --> 15:38.436
that's gonna be
a lot harder to trace.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.305
So we have to find proof.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.206
We should talk
to catco's lawyers if you
really suspect Armstrong.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.009
No, we can't trust them,
they could be working
with Armstrong.

15:45.011 --> 15:51.683
But we do know someone
who has a legal background
who might be able to help us.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.952
Don't we, James?

15:57.991 --> 16:01.192
And this is a completely
hypothetical situation?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.361
Right, because, you know,
if we were actually planning

16:03.363 --> 16:06.130
on going after
the chairman of the board

16:06.132 --> 16:07.565
of the company that
we all work at,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.968
that would just be insanity.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.970
Full-blown,
career-ending insanity.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.973
Can we get a warrant to
search Mr. Armstrong's office?

16:14.975 --> 16:17.141
You need something
like a paper trail

16:17.143 --> 16:21.145
in which Armstrong
directly references
conspiring against cat.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.314
James: Now, so let's say
we get that proof.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.316
Then can we stop him?
Can we get him fired?

16:25.318 --> 16:29.153
If you can prove
Armstrong is colluding
against cat, his ceo,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.756
then we're talking
corporate wrongdoing.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.992
Forget fired, you could
get him arrested.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.161
Thank you, Lucy.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.997
But go after Armstrong
without hard evidence,

16:38.999 --> 16:41.199
and this is my
expert legal advice,

16:41.201 --> 16:43.668
you'd be making things
a lot worse for your boss.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.871
Woman: (On TV)
<i> An unknown woman is</i>
<i> hovering over catco Plaza,</i>

16:46.873 --> 16:50.341
<i> with, it seems,</i>
<i> the same powers as Supergirl.</i>

16:50.343 --> 16:53.611
<i> Does she mean us harm?</i>
<i> Should we be concerned?</i>

16:53.613 --> 16:56.280
You, um,
you have the thing, Kara,
you asked me to remind you.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.082
-Yeah.
-James: Don't worry about us.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.951
We'll keep working on this.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.220
-(Phone ringing)
-I saw it.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.256
She's calling you out, Kara.
You don't have to go.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.891
You know I do.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.032
Astra!

17:15.502 --> 17:18.036
-No bodyguards?
-No knife.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.705
No armor.
No one besides you and me.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.040
Will you talk to me now?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.777
You can't say it's not fair.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.278
We're done with fair.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.290
(Both grunting)

17:55.341 --> 17:56.474
(Grunts)

18:12.692 --> 18:14.092
(Grunts)

18:16.196 --> 18:17.495
Again.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.863
Just like alura.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.698
She was a better woman
than you'll ever be.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.533
-She was a murderer.
-Liar.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.104
Oh, she called me a liar, too.
She had to.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.107
Had to make someone else
responsible for her deception.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.142
And cruelty.
And weakness.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.344
Her only weakness
was letting you live!

18:35.448 --> 18:36.514
(Groans)

18:49.462 --> 18:50.962
(Grunts)

19:04.244 --> 19:05.810
(Sirens wailing)

19:12.852 --> 19:14.852
-Here.
-Containment, now.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.087
We'll call you
when she wakes up.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.856
Don't. She can rot.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.325
(Beeping)

19:23.429 --> 19:25.997
First of all, I am very
happy that your aunt
didn't murder you.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.265
Thanks, winn.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.900
And second,

19:30.770 --> 19:31.869
I got a plan to get Armstrong.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.604
Actually, couldn't be easier.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.774
All I gotta do is plant
this little device on
Armstrong's computer,

19:36.776 --> 19:40.912
and then I'll be able
to access, remotely
and discreetly,

19:40.914 --> 19:42.180
all of his files.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.183
So... so how do we
get it on the computer?

19:45.185 --> 19:48.753
Um, well, um...
One of us is going to have
to go over there and do it.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.289
I'm... I'm...
I gonna have to be running
point at my keyboard.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.624
And, well, I figured that Kara
should be on lookout.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.459
She's got the X-ray vision.

19:57.463 --> 20:01.265
Oh! So I'm the one
who gets arrested if
this doesn't work out.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.068
-James, you don't have to.
-No. It's all good.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.037
Okay. How do I do this?

20:06.039 --> 20:09.607
Yes. Okay, so once
we're in dirk's office,
we'll need a distraction.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.442
Woman: (On phone)
<i> Dirk Armstrong's office.</i>

20:11.444 --> 20:16.547
Uh, yeah,
uh, Mr. Armstrong's
Maserati is on fire.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.257
Armstrong's on the move.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.792
(Panting) Not the Maserati.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.393
Not the Maserati.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.897
(Elevator dings)

20:36.836 --> 20:41.105
James, you have approximately
90 seconds to get in and out
before Armstrong returns.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.575
Okay, I'm in.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.250
Guys, we got a problem.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.185
<i> The computer is plastic.</i>

20:54.187 --> 20:56.187
Dude, that's okay.
You just, just pry open
the monitor's cooling vent

20:56.189 --> 20:58.256
and attach the bug
to the inner wiring.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.364
What is the point of having
all these muscles

21:06.366 --> 21:08.532
if you can't open
a stupid little plastic box?

21:08.534 --> 21:09.600
Winn.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.979
Okay, and downloading.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.682
Yes! (Exhales)

21:24.684 --> 21:27.718
God, I'm enjoying
corporate espionage,
like, a little too much.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.959
James, hurry,
Armstrong is close.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.695
I'm going to heat-vision
the sprinklers,
set off the fire alarm.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.164
Or... or jump out
the window
and I'll catch you.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.300
No. No. I got this.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.535
Kara: <i> But he's</i>
<i> going to see you.</i>

21:47.507 --> 21:49.040
Mr. Olsen?

21:49.609 --> 21:50.975
Curious.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.576
Catco's art director

21:52.578 --> 21:55.313
stopping by its
chairman of the board's
office unannounced,

21:55.315 --> 21:59.150
on what is, no doubt,
catco's worst day?

21:59.152 --> 22:02.586
I wouldn't say that
it's catco's worst day.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.222
I'd say it's cat Grant's.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.259
It may get hard
to draw that distinction.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.395
I agree,

22:11.397 --> 22:16.901
except for the fact that
catco's bigger than just
one person, even cat Grant.

22:16.903 --> 22:23.607
And if she implodes
and the board has
to make some changes,

22:23.609 --> 22:25.943
I'd just like you to know,
you have my full support.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.679
Dirk: <i> Of course, none of us</i>
<i> want this to happen.</i>
James: <i> No, of course not.</i>

22:28.681 --> 22:31.882
But, should it
become unavoidable,

22:31.884 --> 22:35.186
the board appreciates
having you in its corner.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.756
(Sighs)

22:41.461 --> 22:42.526
(Exhales)

22:42.528 --> 22:44.428
(Phone ringing)

22:45.465 --> 22:47.198
Everything okay?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.299
Astra's awake.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.533
I told you I don't care.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.268
She said she'll
only talk to you.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.877
I'm glad you're here.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.445
I'm glad you're
back in a cell.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.547
You fought well.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.217
You have two minutes.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.658
You still have it?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.727
It's time you knew
everything, Kara.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.439
When I went on the run,
I took this with me.

23:28.441 --> 23:34.178
I would hold it in my hand
to remind myself of why I was
turning my back on my family,

23:34.180 --> 23:37.281
and betraying
the high council.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.250
It would all be worth it
if you survived.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.919
Oh, because you
cared about me?

23:41.921 --> 23:44.855
Did you care about
the people you and your
fanatic husband killed?

23:44.857 --> 23:47.525
We did what we had to do.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.460
Alura is the one with
blood on her hands.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.296
My mother was the best woman
who ever lived.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.435
Tell that to those of us
who were thrown into
that nightmare prison.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.638
I think you went
crazy in fort rozz.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.441
I think you stared into miles
of pitch black space

24:03.443 --> 24:06.343
until everything
good inside of you died.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.279
Do you wanna know
how she caught me?

24:09.382 --> 24:11.949
That day in your room.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.653
Was it your idea
to message me with
the spy beacon,

24:16.389 --> 24:18.322
or was it alura's?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.861
How could you have done this?

24:23.863 --> 24:26.297
You've gone against everything
our people hold dear.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.299
Our people will be
dead in a year

24:28.301 --> 24:32.203
if they continue treating
our world like
an inexhaustible playground.

24:32.205 --> 24:35.039
-You killed a guard.
-Non did.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.842
It was
an unfortunate necessity.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.978
Come home with me, astra.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.148
I can plead your case
in front of the high counsel.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.649
Non will go
to prison for life,

24:45.651 --> 24:47.318
but your sentence
could be commuted.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.554
What do I care about prison?
We are dying, alura!

24:50.556 --> 24:52.389
All of us!

24:52.391 --> 24:55.226
Kara is dying.
I will not let that happen.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.661
I don't care how many laws
I have to break.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.765
We used to be
on the same side, sister.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.935
We can be again.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.171
I cannot be part
of your designs.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.207
Then I am sorry.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.942
Not as sorry as I am.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.914
No. Don't do this.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.450
I have to.

25:19.452 --> 25:21.418
I can't let you hurt anyone.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.128
I don't remember that.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.398
Your mother signed the death
warrants of our entire race
and she used you to do it.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
-I don't believe you.
-Yes, you do.

25:36.402 --> 25:40.638
Much like Krypton,
this planet is on the verge
of ecological destruction.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.640
I can stop it.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.542
But the humans won't
like my methods.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.877
That's why I need you.
They trust you.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.445
Together we can save them.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.748
You're never gonna
leave this cell.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.950
I am begging you.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.721
Please help me.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.491
Kara!

26:02.094 --> 26:03.661
I love you.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.898
Wait. Did you use me
to get astra arrested?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.067
-Alura: <i> Hello, Kara.</i>
-Don't say my name right now.

26:10.069 --> 26:14.004
Did you use me to draw
astra out of hiding?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.272
<i> Yes.</i>

26:17.944 --> 26:19.910
How could you do that?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.745
<i> Astra had broken the law.</i>

26:21.747 --> 26:24.481
<i> You were the only person</i>
<i> she trusted enough to meet.</i>

26:24.483 --> 26:26.517
<i> -It was necessary.</i>
-Could she have saved us?

26:26.519 --> 26:28.852
<i> -She was a criminal.</i>
-But was she right?

26:28.854 --> 26:30.788
<i> I am not programmed to</i>
<i> give you that information.</i>

26:30.790 --> 26:32.189
Tell me!

26:32.191 --> 26:34.758
<i> I'm sorry, I am not programmed</i>
<i> to give you that information.</i>

26:34.760 --> 26:38.462
You let everyone
that I love die!

26:38.464 --> 26:41.498
You left me!
You left me alone!

26:41.500 --> 26:43.834
You sent me away!
How could you do that?

26:43.836 --> 26:47.438
<i> -I am not programmed...</i>
-(Screams)

26:49.208 --> 26:50.708
(Sobs)

26:51.711 --> 26:53.611
Hey, hey, hey.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.946
It's not really her.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.982
She lied to me.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.451
Kara, that wasn't your mom.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.653
You don't know
what happened then.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.788
Only what astra
is telling you now.

27:04.790 --> 27:09.226
I know that astra and I
were both given life
sentences by my mother.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.494
We didn't have a choice.

27:11.564 --> 27:12.796
Kara...

27:26.646 --> 27:28.879
-What happened? What...
-Are you okay? What'd she do?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.681
-Was this astra?
-Everything all right?

27:30.683 --> 27:32.916
Please. I don't...
I don't want
to talk about it.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.885
Can we just...

27:34.887 --> 27:36.320
Winn: Yeah, okay.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.023
Uh, dirk Armstrong's
e-mail accounts,

27:39.025 --> 27:40.924
and there are several,

27:40.926 --> 27:43.661
um, are harder to crack
than catco's, almost,

27:43.663 --> 27:46.497
-so I'm just getting into it.
-Okay.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.333
Anything else from
Ms. Grant's e-mails?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.502
Uh, more of the same.

27:51.504 --> 27:55.706
Uh, well, no, actually,
there was this
one e-mail from the bank,

27:55.708 --> 27:58.242
um, asking for cat's
electronic signature

27:58.244 --> 28:03.347
so they could approve a wire
transfer into an account
belonging to an Adam foster.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.748
Who's Adam foster?

28:04.750 --> 28:07.918
According to some
Internet sleuthing, he's 24,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.787
he lives in opal city.

28:09.789 --> 28:14.858
Cat makes monthly payments
into his personal account.

28:14.860 --> 28:20.431
Yeah, almost as if
cat is, you know,
keeping him on the side.

28:20.433 --> 28:25.769
Wait. So you think that
I am supporting, what,
a rent-boy?

28:26.972 --> 28:29.440
-No.
-If I wanted to have sex
with a beach boy

28:29.442 --> 28:31.141
I'd still be sleeping
with John stamos.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.143
Do you really think
that I need to pay for it?

28:33.145 --> 28:37.081
No, of course I don't.
The boys do... did.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.883
I know better.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.252
(Sighs) So if it's not
a male escort...

28:42.254 --> 28:44.121
I... I have no idea.

28:45.491 --> 28:48.258
But... but when winn
mentioned opal city,

28:48.260 --> 28:51.095
I remembered how
when I sent out
your Christmas cards,

28:51.097 --> 28:54.732
there's one addressed
to an a. Foster
in opal city.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.835
(Sighs)

28:59.672 --> 29:00.571
Damn it.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.574
Who's a. Foster, Ms. Grant?

29:03.576 --> 29:06.076
Adam foster is my son.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.347
My oldest.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.650
His father is somebody who
I hadn't dated very long.

29:13.652 --> 29:16.854
I didn't know him very well.
He's not Carter's father.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.157
Adam was just one
of those things

29:20.159 --> 29:24.094
that I hadn't planned on
when I was building catco.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.430
My ex told me that
I didn't care about my son,

29:26.432 --> 29:30.501
that all I cared about was
my business, and why should
either of them stick around?

29:30.503 --> 29:32.970
-Was that true?
-I don't know.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.774
I sued for custody.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.609
I hired a powerhouse attorney

29:38.611 --> 29:41.044
and I threw
everything I had at him,

29:42.948 --> 29:44.615
but I lost.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.785
You tried. Sometimes all
you can do is try.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.621
I didn't lose.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.724
I quit.

29:53.726 --> 29:55.325
I dropped the lawsuit.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.394
I was working at catco 24-7

29:57.396 --> 30:00.464
and, well,
I really did believe

30:00.466 --> 30:03.667
that we would be
in each other's lives.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.803
What happened?
Did you just...

30:07.139 --> 30:08.539
...send him off?

30:08.541 --> 30:11.909
No. I did not
just send him off.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.181
You have no idea
what that moment is like,

30:18.684 --> 30:20.317
when you have to say
to yourself,

30:20.319 --> 30:24.555
"maybe my child
would be better off
without me."

30:28.093 --> 30:32.996
I just know what it feels
like to wonder about
a mother's choices.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.200
Would you make
a different decision
if you could go back?

30:36.202 --> 30:40.704
I stopped asking myself
that question years ago.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.740
Not being there for Adam
is my greatest regret.

30:43.742 --> 30:49.179
And now, for all we know,
somebody is about
to release it to the world.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.581
Maybe you could talk to him.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.518
Try and get him to understand.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.856
No. After not speaking
for so long,
I don't get to do that.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.625
He's going to get hurt.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.861
By me. Again.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.463
(Sighs)

31:06.465 --> 31:10.767
But I will not
allow him to end up

31:10.769 --> 31:13.537
in the middle of a
hideous media storm.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.439
What?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.274
What are you going to do?

31:17.276 --> 31:21.712
I will negotiate a graceful,
lucrative exit.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.916
And I will step down
from catco.

31:30.823 --> 31:34.424
Woman: (On TV) <i> It seems</i>
<i> cat Grant's silence</i>
<i> regarding the catco hack</i>

31:34.426 --> 31:36.126
<i> is about to be broken.</i>

31:36.128 --> 31:37.928
<i> But will today's</i>
<i> press conference</i>

31:37.930 --> 31:41.899
<i> be a victory for the magnate,</i>
<i> or a very sudden fall?</i>

31:41.901 --> 31:44.234
Are you sure
you want to do this?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.737
Well, like taxes, aging,

31:46.739 --> 31:49.973
and participating
in Martha Stewart's
annual secret Santa,

31:49.975 --> 31:52.276
this is something
I have to do.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.244
I don't know what
I'm going to do after this.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.080
I don't know if there
is anything I can do.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.617
I'm pretty sure you can do
anything, Ms. Grant.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.923
Ker-rah.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.925
Whatever comes next,

32:07.927 --> 32:10.327
for what it's worth,

32:10.329 --> 32:13.697
you always have
a job with me if you want it.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.099
Shall we?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.772
-James: Hey.
-What are you guys
doing here?

32:21.774 --> 32:23.307
Saving the day!

32:23.309 --> 32:24.374
Take a look at this.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.378
Where did you get this?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.314
Uh, well...

32:30.316 --> 32:33.450
It... you know, it's
probably better if we don't
tell you, Ms. Grant.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.851
From a legal standpoint.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.387
I recognize three
out of the four of you.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.690
Uh, this is my girlfriend.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.792
Lucy Lane.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.730
-Lois Lane's kid sister?
-Yes.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.066
Well, congratulations,
you got the looks.

32:50.402 --> 32:54.137
You launched this
investigation of dirk because?

32:54.139 --> 32:58.308
Because I...
I overheard something
he said after the board...

32:58.310 --> 33:01.979
Actually, uh, it was
what you said,

33:01.981 --> 33:05.549
about him, uh, smelling blood.

33:05.551 --> 33:06.850
Mmm-hmm.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.887
Ker-rah, stall the press

33:10.889 --> 33:14.591
and tell that walking
personification of
white male privilege

33:14.593 --> 33:16.326
to come to my office.

33:20.766 --> 33:24.001
-Cat.
-Dirk.

33:24.003 --> 33:28.505
I assume this is
about your e-mails?

33:28.507 --> 33:29.573
Oh, spare me, dirk.

33:29.575 --> 33:30.841
I know you're behind the hack.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.543
I know you want
to take over catco.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.878
And...

33:35.714 --> 33:37.381
I have proof.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.450
Yes, you lay out
the whole plan.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.386
Hack and embarrass me,

33:42.388 --> 33:45.355
get me to take a break,
spearhead a hostile takeover.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.257
You even have bullet points.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.860
-You anal little...
-Okay, all right.

33:49.862 --> 33:53.563
So your proof
against me hacking you
is you hacking me?

33:53.565 --> 33:55.198
(Scoffs)

33:55.200 --> 33:58.201
My lawyers will have
a field day with that.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.037
Yes.

34:00.039 --> 34:03.974
Except, this e-mail was
written on a computer
that was paid for by catco.

34:03.976 --> 34:06.443
It was sent using
an e-mail account

34:06.445 --> 34:09.579
that linked to catco
regarding catco business.

34:09.581 --> 34:13.750
So that means,
technically, your e-mails
are catco's property.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.454
Legally, they belong to me.

34:17.456 --> 34:21.458
Oh, and just so you know
what's going on as we speak.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.728
Catco security, in conjunction
with national city police,

34:24.730 --> 34:28.565
they're seizing your
computers, your iPads,
your mobile devices.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.567
And as for you...

34:30.569 --> 34:32.469
Gentlemen?

34:32.471 --> 34:36.239
Make sure the press
get plenty of pictures
of him being dragged out.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.253
-You did it.
-We all did it.

34:55.761 --> 34:59.262
Winn, I'm really sorry
about before.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.332
I didn't...
I didn't quite get it.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.433
Get what?

35:06.371 --> 35:07.838
How much you like Kara.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.441
(Stammering)

35:11.443 --> 35:14.144
-Oh... that's not... I...
-(Chuckling)

35:14.146 --> 35:16.279
I mean... yeah,
of course I like her,

35:16.281 --> 35:18.048
like, as a friend,
and colleague,

35:18.050 --> 35:21.618
and, you know, my all-time
favorite superhero.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.055
-And...
-Winn, look, buddy,
you were wrong before.

35:25.057 --> 35:27.190
I'm not in your way.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.059
If you have feelings for Kara,
you should tell her.

35:29.061 --> 35:31.294
Yeah, but man, she is...

35:33.799 --> 35:38.001
She's her, you know,
and I'm... I'm me.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.338
(Sighs) It's not so easy.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.074
No, I mean, what if
she doesn't... I just...

35:44.076 --> 35:48.145
You and your abs wouldn't
even understand that.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.480
I understand
that Kara is special.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.415
And not just
because of the cape.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.988
She's the kind of girl
worth risking it all for.

35:57.990 --> 36:01.858
Hey, man. If I were you,
I'd risk it.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.902
How's your sister?

36:11.904 --> 36:13.703
Heartbroken.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.839
She can't afford
to be right now.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.374
Something's not adding up.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.842
(Sighs) I know.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.011
Not a single alien's
come looking for astra.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.513
No, no, no, in the fight.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.348
Astra beats Kara twice,

36:25.350 --> 36:28.051
and then
she loses spectacularly.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.955
Something's off

36:31.957 --> 36:34.291
and I can't read
astra's mind to find out why.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.728
Kryptonians are
impervious to my telepathy,

36:38.730 --> 36:40.964
which Superman
finds hilarious.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.465
You can read minds?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.869
Another day, Alex.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.306
Um...

36:49.308 --> 36:51.808
-Wait a minute. Look.
-What should I be seeing?

36:51.810 --> 36:53.476
Astra steps over Kara.

36:53.478 --> 36:58.148
That is like the most open
and weak stance you can take.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.951
Astra's a warrior.
She'd know that.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.487
She wanted to lose.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.331
You let Supergirl beat you.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.399
Your troops haven't
come looking for you.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.735
There's only
one reason for that.
Those aren't their orders.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.238
You wanted us distracted
while they carried
out their real plan.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.074
-What is it?
-Alex: Let me make
something clear.

37:24.076 --> 37:28.245
If I have to come
in there and beat it
out of you, I will.

37:28.247 --> 37:31.248
You're the one who
defeated the hellgrammite.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.919
I like you.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.422
-But it's too late.
-For what?

37:39.424 --> 37:41.992
To stop what's
happening right now.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.613
Oh, ker-rah.

38:03.615 --> 38:07.117
Another week,
another crisis averted

38:07.119 --> 38:08.618
thanks to you.

38:11.290 --> 38:14.557
My secret weapon,
my guardian angel.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.860
It was nothing.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.996
Oh, no. It was something.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.065
It was something
extraordinary.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.700
You saved me
from a potentially

38:23.702 --> 38:26.136
very embarrassing
situation with Adam.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.571
You know, I was thinking,

38:28.573 --> 38:33.076
about how you overheard dirk
after the board meeting.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.544
I was standing right
next to you

38:34.546 --> 38:37.480
and there is no way
that he was within earshot.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.582
-Um...
-And then I was thinking
about the earthquake

38:39.584 --> 38:43.320
and how you got sick
for the first time since
I've known you.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.921
And you had a broken arm,

38:44.923 --> 38:51.261
and Supergirl
mysteriously went Mia.

38:51.263 --> 38:54.230
And then she came back,
and your cold was gone.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.066
That's just a coincidence.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.835
I was also
thinking about livewire.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.837
About how when
she attacked us,

39:00.839 --> 39:02.906
you fled into the stairwell.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.741
(Chuckles) Because
you asked me to.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.445
Yes.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.681
But not two seconds later,
Supergirl shows up.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.351
Another coincidence?

39:16.188 --> 39:18.288
And let's not forget
that you took it personally

39:18.290 --> 39:20.857
when I named her "Supergirl."

39:20.859 --> 39:22.392
Sure, for...

39:23.962 --> 39:25.395
For political reasons.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.731
Do me a favor
and take off your glasses.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.533
My glass...

39:30.869 --> 39:32.235
I...

39:33.638 --> 39:35.805
(Chuckles) I'd... I'd be blind
without them.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.542
I doubt that.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.045
If you're not who
I think you are,
what does it matter?

39:42.047 --> 39:44.080
-Ms. Grant. I...
-Glasses,

39:44.082 --> 39:46.249
or I take it
as a confirmation.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.565
Well...

40:05.537 --> 40:08.104
Let me begin by saying
thank you

40:08.106 --> 40:10.840
for all the help
that you've given me,

40:12.611 --> 40:13.743
Supergirl.

40:19.284 --> 40:23.586
-(Phone ringing)
-Excuse me, I have to...

40:23.588 --> 40:25.822
No, I'm sure
it's very important.
You should go.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.427
Alex, we have a huge problem.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.462
Lord technologies
is under attack.

40:48.413 --> 40:49.712
(Groans)

40:52.584 --> 40:56.186
What do you know?
It works.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.188
You are champion
of this world?

40:58.190 --> 40:59.856
I have my moments.

41:04.396 --> 41:06.362
You have had your last.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.531
Stop! Stay where you are!

41:09.968 --> 41:11.634
Kill them all.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.575
(Rapid gunfire)

41:44.102 --> 41:45.668
(Screams)

42:12.531 --> 42:14.230
You don't fight like a human.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.266
Because I'm not.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.406
(Gun cocks)

42:33.485 --> 42:34.884
(Grunts)

42:47.165 --> 42:48.498
(Grunting)

42:56.575 --> 42:59.409
You remember me, little girl?

42:59.411 --> 43:00.910
You're non.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.645
Astra's husband.

43:02.647 --> 43:05.648
To think that you're
the last daughter of the
once great house of El.

43:05.650 --> 43:08.251
You're gonna wish
I'd died with
the rest of them!
