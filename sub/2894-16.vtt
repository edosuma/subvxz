00:00.133 --> 00:05.738
Modok: One more time,
you arrogant subroutine!

00:05.740 --> 00:10.576
Jarvis:  <i>Negative, you are</i>
<i>attempting to illegally access</i>
<i>stark technology.</i>

00:10.578 --> 00:15.014
Modok: Engaging offline
application, mark one.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.516
Jarvis:  <i>Processing...</i>
<i>Access granted.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.352
<i>Welcome back, mr. Stark.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:25.024
Modok: That is how
you hack software.
He's all yours.

00:28.661 --> 00:33.098
Computer, you will refer
to me as "master."

00:33.100 --> 00:36.568
Replay simulation.
Avengers versus my cabal.

00:36.570 --> 00:40.372
<i>As you wish... Master.</i>

00:44.511 --> 00:47.246
Jarvis:  <i>As you know, the stark</i>
<i>pre-play variable system</i>

00:47.248 --> 00:48.814
<i>Compiles data</i>
<i>collected in combat,</i>

00:51.217 --> 00:54.086
<i>Creating predictive strategies</i>
<i>that drastically increase</i>

00:54.088 --> 00:55.587
<i>The avengers'</i>
<i>efficiency in battle.</i>

00:58.391 --> 00:59.992
<i>It's my turn!</i>
<i>(yelling)</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:07.833
Modify pre-play input.
Assume that the cabal
works as a unit.

01:07.835 --> 01:12.371
Assume that they perform
like avengers.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.574
Jarvis:  <i>Doubtful, but</i>
<i>interesting... Master.</i>

01:18.678 --> 01:20.612
Jarvis:  <i>Success, 40%.</i>

01:20.614 --> 01:22.481
Red skull:
An understatement, computer.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.484
The transformation
of the cabal's strategy
would be significant.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.686
Jarvis:  <i>Success, 60%.</i>

01:35.129 --> 01:40.099
Jarvis:  <i>Success, 80%.</i>
<i>Master, you have</i>
<i>discovered a weakness</i>

01:40.101 --> 01:41.700
<i>In the avengers'</i>
<i>defense strategy.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:44.203
Finally! Play it through.

01:51.211 --> 01:54.780
Modok: Is stark's little
video game all you
hoped it would be?

01:54.782 --> 01:58.617
It is the key to
everything, m.O.D.O.K.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.854
The cabal's time
is at hand,

02:01.856 --> 02:05.324
And tony stark
has shown me the way.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.229
Jarvis:  <i>Success, 100%.</i>

02:26.646 --> 02:28.680
(slobbering)

02:30.416 --> 02:31.483
(splashes)

02:31.918 --> 02:35.687
Disgusting.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.658
(spits) silence, head,
before I pop you
like a blowfish.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.594
The repugnant one
does have a point.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.731
They're called "utensils."
try one.

02:45.733 --> 02:49.468
You do not command me.
I'm a warlord of atlantis,

02:49.470 --> 02:52.337
You are a king of leeches.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.540
(snarling)

02:55.675 --> 02:56.742
(laughing)

02:57.243 --> 02:58.310
(shouts)

03:05.418 --> 03:06.318
(liquid lapping)

03:06.320 --> 03:07.753
Hmm?

03:07.755 --> 03:11.490
Computer, implement
a proper response.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.459
Jarvis:  <i>Your wish is</i>
<i>my command... Master.</i>

03:16.429 --> 03:17.629
(groans)

03:17.631 --> 03:18.597
(grunts)

03:25.905 --> 03:27.272
(sighs)

03:27.674 --> 03:29.608
Huh?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.377
A cold, red center.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.713
Perfect.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.585
You've never shown
such skill. Explain.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.961
What you see before you
is a software

03:48.963 --> 03:51.763
That was locked
deep inside my armor.

03:51.765 --> 03:56.868
The program contains
a limitless array of battle
tactics and strategies.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.672
It is one of iron man's
most critical tools.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.709
With it, we have the means
to destroy our enemies

04:03.711 --> 04:05.777
By using their own
methods against them...

04:06.746 --> 04:09.281
With one problem.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.452
Success requires a talent
that this group sorely lacks.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.787
Trust.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.790
If success is what you crave,

04:19.425 --> 04:21.326
Are you willing

04:22.028 --> 04:24.363
To trust me?

04:24.365 --> 04:27.466
(crows cawing)

04:37.310 --> 04:40.379
Lord dracula,
if you please.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.448
(growls)

04:54.327 --> 04:57.362
Man: No! What is happening?
(crowd clamoring)

04:57.364 --> 04:59.598
Red skull: (over speakers)
<i>washington, d.C.!</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:02.768
<i>Your city has been chosen</i>
<i>as the first to witness</i>

05:02.770 --> 05:05.570
<i>The power of the cabal!</i>

05:05.572 --> 05:10.842
<i>Hand over your leaders</i>
<i>to us, and we</i>
<i>shall be merciful.</i>

05:10.844 --> 05:15.080
<i>Defy us, and we shall not.</i>

05:17.016 --> 05:22.354
It has begun!
The future of the cabal
rests with you.

05:22.356 --> 05:26.058
We will do
our part, skull.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.995
If you fail us again,
there is nothing
in this world

05:29.997 --> 05:35.600
Nor any other, that will
stop me from feasting
upon your soul.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.739
That would be
terrifying, vampire,

05:40.741 --> 05:43.475
If I had a soul.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.979
Meet your new king!

05:48.681 --> 05:49.748
Tank!

05:52.418 --> 05:56.455
(grunts) is that the best
you humans can muster?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.824
Red skull: Attuma, you have
two minutes and 38 seconds!

06:00.693 --> 06:02.060
(firing)

06:05.798 --> 06:08.066
M.O.D.O.K., the vultures
are gathering.

06:16.743 --> 06:20.679
Forty-five seconds slower
than you predicted, skull.

06:20.681 --> 06:24.583
When we rule the world,
I will see to it
the planes run on time.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.558
Cabal! They are here!

06:38.965 --> 06:41.666
Bah! It's only
the thunderer!

06:41.668 --> 06:43.835
I shall knock him
back into the sky!

06:43.837 --> 06:46.004
(roars)

06:46.006 --> 06:49.141
Yeah, what are you going
to do to me, fish face?

06:49.143 --> 06:51.810
(clears throat)
they're here.

06:51.812 --> 06:55.080
Red skull: Impossible!
How could they
get here so quickly?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.948
My plan was foolproof!

06:56.950 --> 06:58.083
So says the fool!

06:58.085 --> 07:00.919
(grunts)

07:00.921 --> 07:03.855
Announcing that you're
attacking washington, d.C.?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.791
Are you getting
more desperate,
or just plain dumber?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.163
(both grunting)

07:15.134 --> 07:16.935
(groaning)

07:16.937 --> 07:19.571
(clattering)

07:19.573 --> 07:24.176
We are at our strongest.
The avengers' day has come!

07:24.178 --> 07:25.677
(suit powering up)

07:27.180 --> 07:29.848
No!

07:29.850 --> 07:34.085
If by "day," you mean
another day the avengers
hand you your bony butt,

07:34.821 --> 07:35.720
Sure.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.689
(roaring)

07:37.691 --> 07:39.825
(groans)

07:39.827 --> 07:41.793
(groaning)

07:47.133 --> 07:48.834
Since you hooked up
with the adaptoid,

07:48.836 --> 07:51.803
You're all body
and no brain, m.O.D.O.K.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.206
What?
(screams)

07:54.208 --> 07:58.043
Black widow: Something's
different. The cabal aren't
usually this coordinated.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.911
Hawkeye: Maybe,
but a target's still a target.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.088
Jarvis:  <i>Master, the</i>
<i>percentages are</i>
<i>moving so rapidly,</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:11.723
<i>Even I'm getting dizzy.</i>

08:11.725 --> 08:13.592
Shut up, computer!

08:13.594 --> 08:16.027
Cabal, listen to me!

08:16.029 --> 08:19.764
Stay with the plan!
Cabal! Cabal!

08:19.766 --> 08:24.703
Iron man: In record time.
Man, even I'm starting to feel
embarrassed for you.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.205
The cabal might not
take d.C. Today...

08:27.207 --> 08:30.075
(beeping)

08:30.077 --> 08:33.010
But you avengers won't
be around to see it!

08:33.013 --> 08:36.280
Computer, commence
self-destruct sequence.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.784
Wha...
Avengers, move!

08:40.620 --> 08:42.087
(thrusters roaring)

08:54.233 --> 08:55.700
(metallic clang)
(groans)

09:13.786 --> 09:15.954
(grunts)

09:18.224 --> 09:20.592
Quickly, regroup!

09:21.294 --> 09:22.761
Attuma!

09:23.229 --> 09:24.329
M.O.D.O.K.?

09:26.032 --> 09:27.666
Dracula?

09:34.707 --> 09:37.075
So much for trust.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.615
Hawkeye: Well, I say we
take the next month off.

09:43.617 --> 09:46.017
I'm gonna need a month
just to enjoy this moment!

09:46.019 --> 09:47.218
(camera focuses)

09:47.220 --> 09:51.056
Say "defeat!"
(laughs)

09:51.058 --> 09:52.691
That's my new profile pic.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.365
(groaning in pain)

10:00.367 --> 10:02.767
Wouldn't believe it
if I wasn't seeing it
with my own eye.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.604
Might want to back up.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.039
I know standard procedure's
to confiscate his armor,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.275
But skull may have it
booby-trapped.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.677
(growls) I'll get it off him.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.783
(growls)

10:18.785 --> 10:21.152
Didn't I just say
not to do that?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.921
I did, right?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.990
Thor: I know you are angry,
but you will break...
(straining)

10:24.992 --> 10:26.224
Just an arm!

10:26.226 --> 10:29.661
Something's wrong.
This was too easy.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.097
Don't be such
a star-spangled spoilsport.

10:32.099 --> 10:35.333
We do actually
catch the bad guys.
Once in a while.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.370
Cap's right.
As long as the rest of
the cabal is out there,

10:38.372 --> 10:39.838
Skull's still a threat.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.176
Okay, put the victory cake
back in the fridge.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.946
Falcon, we got a blown-up
cabal sub to check out.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.016
Falcon: Sounds like a hoot.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.684
Captain america: Skull's team
couldn't have gotten far.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.419
Use the aven-jet's
tracking systems,

10:54.421 --> 10:57.389
Local police bands,
cell feeds, anything
that can catch their scent.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.957
And what
of you, captain?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.191
I got a skull to crack.

11:14.807 --> 11:18.443
I've watched you sacrifice
thousands of lives for
your own petty ambitions.

11:18.445 --> 11:22.047
Never once have I seen you
risk your own
for a teammate...

11:22.049 --> 11:25.917
Until today.
That troubles me.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.254
We do know each other well,
don't we, captain?

11:29.256 --> 11:32.424
That will make my victory
all the more sweet.

11:32.426 --> 11:35.093
Victory? You have
no chance of escape.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.929
All your so-called
allies abandoned you.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.466
In order to escape,
I would first have
to have been captured.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.935
And as for allies,

11:43.937 --> 11:47.372
(hissing)
you seem to be the only one
who has been abandoned.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.175
Sometimes being right
really bites.

11:50.177 --> 11:53.211
Clever choice of words...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.413
Meat.
(snarls)

11:55.415 --> 11:57.082
(scraping)
(grunts)

11:59.351 --> 12:00.485
(growls)

12:03.756 --> 12:04.823
(sparking)

12:09.295 --> 12:10.161
(groans)

12:11.130 --> 12:13.498
Now, soldier,

12:13.500 --> 12:16.234
Your blood is mine.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.004
Not yet. We must have
our bargaining chip.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.909
(snarls)

12:24.911 --> 12:27.345
Falcon: Tony. You
might want to see this!

12:27.347 --> 12:29.814
(camera whirrs)

12:29.816 --> 12:32.350
Is it just me, or does
this set-up look like...

12:32.352 --> 12:33.518
The data crux.

12:37.890 --> 12:41.259
My pre-play software!
That armor-stealing,
software-hacking...

12:43.929 --> 12:49.033
Cap, we've got
a situation. Cap?

12:49.035 --> 12:52.237
Jarvis:  <i>Master, stark</i>
<i>has discovered our little</i>
<i>secret, as scheduled.</i>

12:52.239 --> 12:54.005
(blaster's firing)

12:58.010 --> 12:59.310
(explosion)
huh?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.979
Greetings, colonel.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.521
Get off my bridge!

13:11.257 --> 13:12.524
(groans)

13:12.526 --> 13:15.360
No longer is your bridge.

13:15.362 --> 13:19.364
Don't run too far, we'll
be needing you shortly.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.200
M.O.D.O.K., will you
do the honors?

13:25.337 --> 13:31.109
Uplink complete.
The cabal is in control
of the tri-carrier.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.244
I am loathe to say it.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.114
Oh, please do.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.884
You are a competent
leader, after all.

13:39.886 --> 13:42.020
Iron man: (on radio)
<i>avengers! Back</i>
<i>to the tri-carrier!</i>

13:42.022 --> 13:44.522
Jarvis:  <i>Master, you're</i>
<i>resting on your laurels.</i>
<i>You may want to speed...</i>

13:44.524 --> 13:46.991
Cabal! Stay focused!

13:46.993 --> 13:50.295
There are preparations
to be made before
the avengers arrive.

13:50.297 --> 13:55.233
Bah! Let them come! I'll
do to them what I will do
to this fool, fury!

13:55.235 --> 13:58.870
(growls)
(groaning)

13:58.872 --> 14:01.873
(beeping)
(smoke hissing)

14:01.875 --> 14:02.540
Huh?

14:05.544 --> 14:09.447
Stark, you guys are up.
Get them off my bridge
and I can do the rest.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.250
You soft-shelled fool!

14:12.252 --> 14:15.887
Fury had operational
codes not stored in the
s.H.I.E.L.D. Computer banks!

14:15.889 --> 14:21.092
How does such a nano-sized
brain create such a large
volume of idiocy?

14:21.094 --> 14:25.496
Watch it, troll! I'll
just make captain america
give us the codes!

14:25.498 --> 14:28.633
(growls)
you'll not touch
the soldier!

14:28.635 --> 14:31.636
He and his superior
blood are mine!

14:31.638 --> 14:35.373
Stick your face
in mine again, parasite,

14:35.375 --> 14:37.442
And I will bury it
where the sun...

14:37.444 --> 14:39.944
Jarvis:  <i>Failure, 60%.</i>

14:39.946 --> 14:42.614
Oh, no, no!
Victory is ours...

14:42.616 --> 14:44.215
(explosion)

14:45.150 --> 14:46.517
...To lose.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.589
Incoming!

14:51.591 --> 14:53.558
Jarvis:  <i>That is a bit of an</i>
<i>understatement... Master.</i>

15:06.105 --> 15:10.341
Careful, guys.
Fury's probably gonna want
this thing back in one piece.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.643
Let's try not
to wreck it...

15:12.211 --> 15:13.311
Much.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.647
(grunts)

15:17.416 --> 15:19.384
Sure, I'll smash...

15:21.153 --> 15:22.053
Gently!

15:24.490 --> 15:27.025
I do not think you
truly mean that, hulk.

15:31.163 --> 15:35.133
Skull certainly wanted
to get on board.
What's the play?

15:35.135 --> 15:37.635
Hawkeye: If I say, "duh,
he wants the tri-carrier,"

15:37.637 --> 15:39.470
Do you promise
not to sting me?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.106
No. He's after
something bigger.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.509
(grunts)
bigger? What's bigger?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.353
Jarvis:  <i>Success, 40%.</i>
<i>Twenty-five... Twenty-three...</i>

15:55.355 --> 15:56.988
(growls)

15:56.990 --> 16:00.024
Skull, I am
implementing mark 9-3,

16:00.026 --> 16:01.726
Divide and
conquer strategy.

16:03.495 --> 16:07.131
Yes. Excellent, m.O.D.O.K.,
that might just work.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.601
Jarvis:  <i>Fifty, 65, 70, 75...</i>
<i>Cabal! Crush them!</i>

16:12.004 --> 16:16.207
(yelling)
hulk! Let us play.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.575
You're weird.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.179
I smash weird!

16:21.181 --> 16:22.547
(growls)

16:22.549 --> 16:24.382
Hulk! Stand aside!
The water king is...

16:28.687 --> 16:30.655
(wicked laughter)

16:32.291 --> 16:33.591
(grunts)

16:35.461 --> 16:38.529
You can swim, but you
can't run, fish-man.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.631
Cretin! Attuma is not running.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.401
He's leading.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.770
(beeping)

16:46.638 --> 16:48.573
What is happening?

16:48.575 --> 16:52.176
Wha...
Yes, what indeed?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.290
Hulk crash?

17:06.291 --> 17:08.259
No, hulk splash!

17:14.465 --> 17:16.733
You are in
my element now, beast!

17:18.503 --> 17:21.372
One immortal
against another, eh?

17:21.374 --> 17:24.776
In the one place devoid
of my only weakness.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.743
Can you say the same?

17:26.746 --> 17:27.645
(snarling)

17:31.417 --> 17:35.720
M.O.D.O.K., I leave
the avengers in
your adaptable hands!

17:36.422 --> 17:38.523
My pleasure, skull.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.728
Adaptoid thing's getting
old, melon head.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.496
How about throwing us
something new?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.165
(lasers firing)

17:48.133 --> 17:50.368
That's new.

17:50.370 --> 17:54.839
I rather like winning.
I'll have to try
it more often.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.476
No matter how you slice it,
the cabal can't beat us.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.710
You just don't have the power!

18:01.713 --> 18:03.147
(thud)

18:03.149 --> 18:06.217
I am in the process of
changing that equation.

18:13.192 --> 18:13.858
Cap!

18:20.732 --> 18:21.699
(black widow yells)

18:24.770 --> 18:28.406
Your pathetic attempts
to switch roles and
be unpredictable

18:28.408 --> 18:30.274
Is so predictable!

18:37.182 --> 18:39.684
Boom! Did you predict that?

18:39.686 --> 18:42.653
Of course!
(laughing)

18:42.655 --> 18:45.389
Tony, heads up.
Big heads up.

18:45.391 --> 18:46.691
<i>M.O.D.O.K.'s loose</i>
<i>on the ship.</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:51.796
Cabal! The pawns are in place.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.564
Red skull:  <i>Excellent.</i>

18:53.566 --> 18:55.333
Release the captain.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.634
(hissing)

18:58.637 --> 19:01.339
You are good
at math, stark.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.475
<i>Is the life of one</i>
<i>worth the lives of so many?</i>

19:04.477 --> 19:06.744
Sometimes I hate math.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.881
Hold on, cap!

19:11.283 --> 19:13.217
(chuckles)

19:22.161 --> 19:24.328
Avengers!

19:24.330 --> 19:29.500
"hulk strongest one
there is"? I will feed
your bones to my dogfish.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.435
(growls)

19:32.337 --> 19:33.638
(roaring)

19:34.506 --> 19:36.507
(grunting)

19:36.509 --> 19:38.543
Iron man:  <i>Avengers, assemble!</i>

19:38.545 --> 19:39.610
Red skull:  <i>Cabal, to me!</i>

19:43.749 --> 19:45.750
This dance ain't over,
blue boy.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.186
(roars)

19:50.956 --> 19:52.690
(roaring)

19:55.227 --> 19:56.761
(straining)

20:02.534 --> 20:04.535
Iron man:  <i>Avengers, assemble!</i>

20:04.537 --> 20:06.237
Red skull:  <i>Cabal, to me!</i>

20:06.239 --> 20:08.206
We will meet
again, thunderer.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.496
You let skull get away?

20:32.498 --> 20:34.232
You're welcome.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.867
We saved the tri-carrier from
the world's greatest villains,

20:36.869 --> 20:40.338
And we saved you.
How is that not a win?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.240
They weren't after
the tri-carrier.

20:42.242 --> 20:46.844
Don't you know
who they were holding
prisoner on that ship?

20:46.846 --> 20:50.548
Jarvis:  <i>Master,</i>
<i>isn't this the base where</i>
<i>you first started operations?</i>

20:50.550 --> 20:53.384
<i>I thought the idea was</i>
<i>to advance your position.</i>

20:53.386 --> 20:55.353
Oh, but I have, computer.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.754
<i>But, sir...</i>

20:57.923 --> 21:03.828
We were victorious!
What wars shall
we wage next?

21:03.830 --> 21:06.597
Let us discuss that
with our newest member.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.304
Hyperion!

21:14.906 --> 21:16.741
Vengeance.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.677
The avengers will pay
for imprisoning me.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.446
In time, hyperion.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.684
I would like to
make you a mutually
beneficial proposition.

21:28.654 --> 21:29.920
Trust me.
