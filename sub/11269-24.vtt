00:01.283 --> 00:04.085
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.887
Well, where the hell
is this guy?

00:06.922 --> 00:08.623
He said he'd be here
in 15 minutes.

00:08.657 --> 00:09.824
It's been nearly 20.

00:09.825 --> 00:11.460
Doesn't he realize
this is an emergency?

00:11.461 --> 00:13.762
Hey, calm down, will you Norm?
He'll be here.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.963
Well, it's a hell
of a world we live in, Sam.

00:15.998 --> 00:17.799
We can put a man
on the moon okay,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.734
but we can't get a beer tap
repairman here

00:19.735 --> 00:21.169
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.937
Norm, sit down!

00:22.972 --> 00:24.956
Just relax.

00:24.957 --> 00:27.175
Why, why don't you have a,
have a bottle of beer?

00:27.176 --> 00:29.577
Yeah, right, a bottle.

00:31.113 --> 00:34.081
It's just not the same, Sam.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.536
Well, I'm sure Mr. Clavin would
let you have some of his beer.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.286
Well, I'm afraid not, Woody.

00:39.287 --> 00:42.890
No, no, you see, we,
we knew that the taps

00:42.891 --> 00:45.059
were gonna be out
of service for a while,

00:45.093 --> 00:46.528
Sam made an announcement.

00:46.562 --> 00:50.465
So I took a moment to figure out
that if I take just a little sip

00:50.499 --> 00:51.733
every now and again,

00:51.767 --> 00:54.636
it would last until the
repairman fixes yon tap.

00:54.670 --> 00:55.937
But, when I suggested

00:55.955 --> 00:59.257
the strategy to Mr. Peterson,

00:59.292 --> 01:02.160
he called me... well, what was
it you called me again, Norm?

01:02.211 --> 01:03.495
Bozo.

01:03.529 --> 01:04.796
Right.

01:04.846 --> 01:07.048
I'm a bozo.

01:07.049 --> 01:10.352
I'm, uh, gonna go to
the men's room now, okay.

01:10.353 --> 01:11.569
Excuse me.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.772
Oh, right, and you're gonna
take your beer with you?

01:13.773 --> 01:15.840
Come on, Cliff.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.608
We've been friends
for 15 years.

01:17.643 --> 01:18.994
I'm so pathetic,

01:19.028 --> 01:22.697
you think I'm gonna steal
my best friend's beer, huh?

01:22.732 --> 01:25.166
Yeah, you're right, Normie.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.250
I trust you.

01:34.143 --> 01:35.911
Bozo.

02:27.697 --> 02:28.980
Yeah...
About an hour ago!

02:28.981 --> 02:30.314
Hey, hey, Norm...
Where in the hell have you been?

02:30.315 --> 02:31.683
Hey, hey, sit!
Whoops.

Sit!

02:33.019 --> 02:34.635
Excuse me.

02:34.669 --> 02:36.771
Yeah, right over here.

02:36.822 --> 02:39.006
Hi.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.642
My name is Carla.

02:40.644 --> 02:42.460
Hi. Don.
Yeah, I know,

02:42.528 --> 02:44.278
I read it off your left pec.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.698
If you, uh,

02:47.750 --> 02:50.151
have anything else
written on your body,

02:50.152 --> 02:52.087
I'm looking for
something to read in bed.

02:52.088 --> 02:55.272
Will you let the man
do his job please, Carla?

02:55.291 --> 02:57.392
I know Braille.

02:57.426 --> 02:59.561
No, no, no, go on.

02:59.562 --> 03:03.648
Oh, hey, look who's back
from vacation.- Miss Howe!

03:03.649 --> 03:05.550
Hi, Rebecca. How
was your cruise?

03:05.551 --> 03:07.802
Well, I can honestly say
that it was the most painful,

03:07.803 --> 03:09.971
excruciating, depressing
experience of my life.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.405
There was not one single

03:11.406 --> 03:13.157
eligible bachelor
on that whole trip.

03:13.158 --> 03:14.558
You know what?

03:14.559 --> 03:16.594
The very first day
I stepped on a poison blowfish,

03:16.595 --> 03:19.130
my leg swelled up like
a bloated corpse.

03:19.131 --> 03:21.784
A bloated corpse without
unsightly stubble I hope.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.835
Oh shut up, Cliff.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.069
FRASIER:
Oh, say, Rebecca,

03:24.070 --> 03:25.603
maybe I misunderstood
you earlier.

03:25.604 --> 03:29.323
I thought the purpose of your
trip wasn't to snare a husband.

03:29.408 --> 03:30.792
Well, of course it wasn't.

03:30.826 --> 03:32.360
Why'd you go?

03:32.361 --> 03:34.862
Woody, I was very clear about
why I went before I left.

03:34.863 --> 03:36.130
Don't you remember?

03:36.165 --> 03:37.699
No.

03:37.733 --> 03:39.668
I said that I went
to find myself,

03:39.669 --> 03:41.235
to look myself
square in the eye

03:41.236 --> 03:43.371
and find out who I really
was, yada, yada, yada.

03:43.372 --> 03:46.240
Oh, yeah. I remember
the yada, yada, yada part.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.426
Half way through the trip,

03:48.427 --> 03:50.662
I realized something-
that my life is doo-doo.

03:50.663 --> 03:51.996
WOODY:
Please, Miss Howe.

03:51.997 --> 03:54.348
You may have used that
kind of language at sea,

03:54.349 --> 03:56.818
but we're not in the
boiler rooms among sailors.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.187
You know, the problem is
that I'm always looking

03:59.188 --> 04:00.188
for some, for some

04:00.189 --> 04:02.891
rich, powerful man,
but not anymore.

04:02.925 --> 04:04.759
Now I want a sweet,
honest guy...

04:04.794 --> 04:05.894
excuse me...

04:05.928 --> 04:07.996
you know,
a nice, hard-working,

04:08.030 --> 04:10.431
decent kind of fellow,
with a great smile...

04:11.617 --> 04:12.984
Excuse me.

04:12.985 --> 04:15.320
But I mean, where are you
gonna find a guy like that?

04:15.321 --> 04:17.555
It's not like they just
pop up out of thin air.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.260
Hey, lady, your
problem's solved.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.595
Good. Bill me.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.163
I'm talking to my friends here.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.765
Thank you so much, Don.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.667
If only we lived in a culture

04:28.701 --> 04:30.991
where men could kiss
other men without shame.

04:32.538 --> 04:35.106
Uh, excuse me.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.974
Uh, I'm Don.

04:37.009 --> 04:39.577
I'm happy for you, Don.

04:39.645 --> 04:44.148
You know, I'm really sorry
about your vacation

04:44.182 --> 04:46.584
and, uh, while I was
working down there,

04:46.585 --> 04:49.454
I couldn't help but notice how
nicely your leg has recovered.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.122
Anyway, I was wondering

04:51.157 --> 04:53.992
if, uh, maybe you'd
want to go out

04:54.026 --> 04:57.395
and have a cup of coffee,
maybe a movie, something.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.330
(laughing)

04:59.364 --> 05:00.731
Excuse me.

05:00.766 --> 05:02.667
Aren't you a plumber?

05:06.088 --> 05:07.988
Well, a service technician.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.674
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

05:12.061 --> 05:15.262
Rebecca, excuse me
for interrupting,

05:15.297 --> 05:16.898
but may I ask you a question?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.566
Do you listen to yourself?

05:18.567 --> 05:19.634
Well, sometimes.

05:19.635 --> 05:20.968
All right, not two minutes ago,

05:20.969 --> 05:22.871
you announced to the bar that
you were opening yourself up

05:22.872 --> 05:24.272
to men from any walk of life.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.707
Now, that man seems
attractive, decent,

05:26.776 --> 05:29.210
and most of all,
interested in you.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.678
You're lonely, desperate,

05:30.679 --> 05:32.413
and if the bloom isn't
off the rose just yet,

05:32.414 --> 05:34.749
you can certainly hear
pruning shears approaching.

05:34.750 --> 05:38.670
He is kind of cute, isn't he?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.138
Actually, he's just
what I was describing.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.439
Can you belie... Is that
just like me or what?

05:42.440 --> 05:43.941
It's like, I'm
just standing here

05:43.942 --> 05:45.992
blathering on and on
and on and on and on,

05:45.993 --> 05:47.212
while opportunity
is just passing

05:47.213 --> 05:48.662
me by- it's like
life is a parade.

05:48.663 --> 05:49.983
Rebecca! Rebecca, fetch!

05:50.049 --> 05:52.934
Oh, sorry, yoo-hoo,
Mr. Burley Working Type Guy,

05:52.968 --> 05:54.268
Hold up a second.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.964
I had a great time.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.599
So did I.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.826
I'll see you
tonight at 7:00? 7:00.

06:18.861 --> 06:20.828
And, uh, oh, I almost forgot.

06:20.863 --> 06:23.097
I, I, I got a little
something for you,

06:23.131 --> 06:24.832
um, just so you
wouldn't be late.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.050
What is it?

06:26.084 --> 06:27.318
(gasps)

06:27.353 --> 06:29.420
Don!

06:29.455 --> 06:32.257
Oh, what a beautiful
antique watch!

06:32.291 --> 06:34.259
Yeah.
Oh, I can't accept this, Don.

06:34.293 --> 06:35.627
It's much too expensive.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.118
No, no, I want you to have it.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.579
It was my mother's.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.815
Oh, when did she die?

06:40.816 --> 06:41.783
She didn't.

06:41.784 --> 06:43.484
She just dozes off a lot.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.169
(both laughing)

06:45.204 --> 06:46.737
Oh, Don, you're so goofy!

06:46.772 --> 06:48.922
REBECCA:
And this is so sweet.

06:48.941 --> 06:52.676
No, Rebecca, nothing's
too good for you.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.479
Maybe you are.

06:57.116 --> 07:01.418
Look at her,
throwing herself at him.

07:01.453 --> 07:02.954
No class.

07:02.988 --> 07:04.455
No class at all.

07:08.126 --> 07:11.228
I just went on a
service call with Don.

07:13.833 --> 07:17.552
He was unplugging a drain.

07:17.586 --> 07:22.256
We got to... we got to... we got
to eat out of his lunch pail,

07:22.290 --> 07:25.960
and then I got to hand him his
tools out of his tool belt.

07:25.994 --> 07:30.130
He wears a tool belt?

07:30.165 --> 07:34.334
Oh, man, why don't you
just spit on my grave.

07:34.336 --> 07:37.321
Well, it's nice seeing you
guys have fun like that.

07:37.355 --> 07:38.639
Oh, yeah.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.725
And you know what's
different about Don?

07:40.726 --> 07:43.494
It's like I'm not always
thinking about my next move.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.547
You know, the less I work at it,
the better it seems to get.

07:46.581 --> 07:50.184
So I'm just gonna take
it nice and easy, nice and slow,

07:50.252 --> 07:51.886
you know, one step at a time,

07:51.921 --> 07:54.121
I'm not gonna fall
too hard or too fast.

07:54.156 --> 07:56.390
God, I love him!

07:57.476 --> 08:01.195
I love him so much!

08:02.731 --> 08:05.065
Do you know what I'm saying?

08:05.067 --> 08:08.336
(falsetto):
Yes, you love him! Yes!

08:09.855 --> 08:12.589
There's even talk of marriage.

08:12.608 --> 08:14.275
Marriage?!
REBECCA: Yeah.

08:14.276 --> 08:15.777
He, he talked about marriage?

08:15.778 --> 08:18.479
Well, he says it with his eyes.

08:19.615 --> 08:22.016
And you know what, I, I
just have to say that

08:22.050 --> 08:24.351
if, if he did ask me
to marry him right now,

08:24.386 --> 08:26.387
I think that I would
have to say yes.

08:26.389 --> 08:29.674
Honey, don't...

08:29.675 --> 08:32.610
You want to step into my
office just for a second? Sure, Sam.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.211
Looky! Looky! Looky! Looky!

08:39.150 --> 08:41.318
You know the idea
of romantic love

08:41.352 --> 08:45.557
is a relatively
new phenomenon. Yeah.

08:45.591 --> 08:49.360
In olden cultures, wives
were no more than chattel.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.647
They'd parade the women
through the marketplace

08:52.681 --> 08:56.584
dressed in nothing but flimsy,
tight-fitting animal skins

08:56.618 --> 08:59.654
with their breasts heaving
and undulating in the...

08:59.655 --> 09:01.539
Cliff, I don't want to hear
anymore of this, okay?

09:01.540 --> 09:04.124
Anybody who wants to hear
the rest of the story,

09:04.159 --> 09:06.089
uh, follow me in the pool room,
please.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.067
Go ahead, Paul.
You know you want to.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.639
I think you're
rushing into this.

09:18.674 --> 09:20.808
You know, I mean,
it's been two weeks.

09:20.842 --> 09:22.643
What do you know about the guy?

09:22.645 --> 09:25.113
I know he's good, he's decent,

09:25.147 --> 09:28.349
and he thinks that I'm the best
thing that ever happened to him.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.734
He said that?

09:29.768 --> 09:32.970
He says it with his eyes.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.389
Does this guy's eyes
shut up long enough

09:35.424 --> 09:37.792
for his mouth
to ever say anything?

09:37.826 --> 09:41.228
Now, Sam, I appreciate
this but I'm a big girl.

09:41.262 --> 09:43.230
And you know what?

09:43.232 --> 09:44.682
I think I'm gonna go for it.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.284
All right, okay, but
you're settling.

09:47.319 --> 09:48.720
Settling?

09:48.754 --> 09:49.954
No way.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.138
Honey, come on.

09:51.172 --> 09:53.641
Look, you've had bad luck
with men all your life.

09:53.642 --> 09:55.210
You're afraid you're never
gonna get married,

09:55.211 --> 09:57.095
so you're latching
onto the first guy

09:57.096 --> 09:59.430
that gives you the time of day.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.099
That is absolutely,
categorically not true!

10:02.101 --> 10:03.334
Yes, it is.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.036
So what?

10:06.038 --> 10:07.571
Is it not better

10:07.573 --> 10:09.690
that I settle and I have someone

10:09.691 --> 10:10.958
than stick to my high standards

10:10.959 --> 10:13.160
and have no one
and end up an old maid?

10:13.228 --> 10:15.863
Honey, that smells
of desperation.

10:15.897 --> 10:18.366
You don't... you
don't need that.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.835
You deserve the
greatest guy in the world.

10:21.870 --> 10:25.173
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I don't believe I'm about to say this.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.574
Sit down, sit down.

10:26.608 --> 10:32.680
Listen, I've been doing a...
doing a lot of thinking recently

10:32.714 --> 10:38.519
about marriage and
settling down and stuff.

10:38.587 --> 10:40.855
Yeah?

10:40.889 --> 10:42.890
(chuckles)

10:42.891 --> 10:45.059
I can't believe this-
my hands are sweating.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.027
Come on, Sam, go on
with what you were saying.

10:47.028 --> 10:52.299
Oh... I, I just think
that... you and I...

10:52.333 --> 10:55.168
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
wait a minute.

10:55.169 --> 10:57.638
You're not saying what I think
you're saying, are you?

10:57.639 --> 11:00.574
You know, I think there's a
chance for you and me if...

11:00.609 --> 11:03.210
If, if what?

11:03.244 --> 11:06.046
All right, all right,
here goes...

11:06.080 --> 11:09.500
If, in the next
couple of years,

11:09.501 --> 11:11.302
the right woman
doesn't come along,

11:11.303 --> 11:13.571
you're on the top of
a very short list.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.128
I know, I can't believe
I'm saying this, either!

11:22.715 --> 11:25.683
God, this is incredible.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.452
This... y-you are saying that

11:28.486 --> 11:32.523
you will marry me if someone
better doesn't come along?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.625
Is it mind-blowing or what?

11:37.896 --> 11:39.747
Oh, just wait, just one second.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.083
I-I-I just want to be
crystal clear on this.

11:42.117 --> 11:48.039
Y-You, you sort of, look at me
like your safety net?

11:48.123 --> 11:50.691
Okay...

11:51.660 --> 11:54.428
You stupid jackass!

11:54.463 --> 11:56.013
What?
How...? What, what?!

11:56.081 --> 11:58.148
How can you be so insensitive?

11:58.149 --> 11:59.667
Oh, oh, now,
now, wait a second.

11:59.668 --> 12:01.936
Listen, all right, maybe the
words didn't come out right,

12:01.937 --> 12:04.404
but all I'm saying is
that you don't have to

12:04.439 --> 12:06.941
settle for this...
this plumber.

12:06.975 --> 12:08.058
Settle? Me?!

12:08.059 --> 12:09.877
Wait a minute, I will
tell you something!

12:09.878 --> 12:11.411
The woman that
marries you will be

12:11.412 --> 12:14.214
the all-time
four-star settler.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.817
What's that
supposed to mean? What does it mean?

12:16.852 --> 12:19.187
Take a look at yourself.
Look at you, I mean,

12:19.188 --> 12:21.189
the only thing you ever
think about is sex.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.257
You think you're going to
make some woman feel special

12:23.258 --> 12:24.592
just because she's
just another notch

12:24.593 --> 12:26.894
in your sliver of a headboard?

12:29.114 --> 12:30.697
Sam, I mean wise up!

12:30.732 --> 12:33.133
Do you ever hear women
talk about you anymore?

12:33.168 --> 12:35.669
You're a cliché.
You are pathetic!

12:35.670 --> 12:37.471
Women talk about you
out there and they,

12:37.472 --> 12:39.342
they laugh at you
like you're a joke!

12:41.877 --> 12:44.811
I have work to do.

12:46.581 --> 12:48.582
God, Sam, I'm-I'm sorry.

12:48.616 --> 12:51.018
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

12:51.019 --> 12:53.487
I-I-I think that I just
was upset because you were

12:53.488 --> 12:56.423
just so inconsiderate and I...

13:00.779 --> 13:05.516
So, the, uh, part
about me being a joke.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.152
You were just making up
that stuff, right?

13:07.153 --> 13:12.339
Oh, yeah, 'cause, you know, you
hurt me, so I wanted to hurt you

13:12.374 --> 13:16.977
and... no, I mean, in fact,
you would, you would make

13:17.011 --> 13:20.614
any woman a real good husband.

13:20.648 --> 13:22.583
You're a catch.

13:25.087 --> 13:26.687
Oh, yeah, that's better.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.000
Have you noticed that,
uh, someone in this bar

13:39.034 --> 13:41.536
is getting a little looney?

13:41.570 --> 13:43.504
Sam...

13:43.505 --> 13:45.655
everyone in this bar
is on a connecting flight

13:45.656 --> 13:47.391
to beyond looney.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.527
Yeah, I'm talking
about Rebecca.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.746
You know, I'm a little
worried about her.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.964
Well, how so?
Well...

13:53.999 --> 13:56.667
She made up this
weird story about how

13:56.702 --> 13:59.337
no one would want to
marry me because, you know,

13:59.371 --> 14:01.405
I've had a lot of
women in my day.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.741
What exactly do you
find weird about that?

14:03.743 --> 14:07.077
Don't say you agree with her?

14:07.079 --> 14:08.745
Well, she has a point, Sam.

14:08.779 --> 14:12.449
Having a prolific sexual past
can be very intimidating

14:12.484 --> 14:15.319
and even unattractive
to a potential mate.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.222
Well, you're as crazy
as she is, Frasier!

14:18.223 --> 14:20.157
Come on, man, you know,
the woman I choose

14:20.158 --> 14:21.892
is going to feel very special.

14:21.926 --> 14:26.129
You know, like when a great chef
picks the perfect pork chop?

14:26.131 --> 14:27.982
That's beautiful, Sam.

14:27.983 --> 14:32.069
But listen, if this is
really bothering you...

14:32.070 --> 14:33.170
I didn't say it
was bothering me.

14:33.171 --> 14:34.771
Well, all right, okay, okay.

14:34.806 --> 14:39.076
But if it does bother you, you're
perfectly capable of making a change.

14:39.111 --> 14:42.279
You can reinvent Sam Malone.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.298
You know, this could be
a turning point for you in your life.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.450
Listen, I'm going to write
down the number of a man.

14:46.451 --> 14:51.388
His name is Dr. Robert Sutton.

14:51.423 --> 14:56.427
And he has a therapy group
for sexual compulsives.

14:56.461 --> 14:58.362
Well, what are-
what are you saying?

14:58.396 --> 14:59.963
I'm hooked on sex?

14:59.964 --> 15:02.500
(chuckling):
Well, let's face it Sam. It consumes you.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.502
Look, be honest.
How long do you think

15:04.503 --> 15:06.237
you could go without
thinking about sex?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.438
As long as I want.

15:08.957 --> 15:11.959
Fine, go ahead.
Time me.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.060
All right, start now.

15:13.061 --> 15:16.964
How long was that?

15:16.998 --> 15:19.132
About a second.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.201
Well, is, is that normal?

15:20.202 --> 15:22.669
For a rabbit!

15:22.670 --> 15:26.307
You know something, I don't,
I don't care what you think.

15:26.308 --> 15:28.876
You know, I am leading
the life that I want to lead.

15:28.910 --> 15:31.145
And if I, if I choose
to settle down someday,

15:31.146 --> 15:33.047
I won't have any problem
finding someone to do it with.

15:33.048 --> 15:35.115
Okay, okay.
I'll tell you what.

15:35.116 --> 15:36.750
Let's get a woman's opinion.
Carla will suffice.

15:36.751 --> 15:38.018
Carla...

15:38.052 --> 15:39.687
What...?

15:39.721 --> 15:43.657
Sam here has a question
he'd like to pop.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.758
Shoot.

15:44.793 --> 15:46.794
Yeah, all right, fine.

15:46.862 --> 15:52.132
Carla, strictly hypothetically,
would you marry me?

15:52.134 --> 15:55.885
Sammy, that's a
stupid question.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.487
Well, I know it is.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.123
Not in a million years!

16:00.158 --> 16:02.259
What?
Oh, Sammy.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.860
Nobody loves you
as much as I do.

16:03.861 --> 16:05.262
But I know you!

16:05.263 --> 16:07.230
You know, we'd be
taking our wedding vows,

16:07.231 --> 16:09.600
and you'd be checking out
the bridesmaids.

16:09.634 --> 16:12.402
You're a hound.
I can't marry a hound.

16:14.372 --> 16:17.541
Hey, I thought we had something
special going on between us.

16:17.576 --> 16:18.709
Definitely, we do.

16:18.743 --> 16:20.978
I just always thought
that I'd be the woman

16:21.012 --> 16:23.414
you cheated on your wife with.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.883
Call me a hopeless romantic.

16:29.621 --> 16:33.124
Well, Sam, uh,
when you're ready.

16:36.244 --> 16:38.078
Norman.
Hey, Fras.

16:38.079 --> 16:39.113
Oh, hey, hey, Norm.

16:39.114 --> 16:40.881
Hmm? Yeah?

16:40.915 --> 16:42.349
Can I talk to you a second?

16:42.383 --> 16:43.683
Sure.

16:43.685 --> 16:46.270
I've been doing a lot of
thinking about my life.

16:46.304 --> 16:48.872
You know, and I think
I need a little advice.

16:48.873 --> 16:49.939
Well, well, hold on a second.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.608
Is this going to be
one of those conversations

16:51.609 --> 16:52.876
where you're feeling
sort of vulnerable

16:52.877 --> 16:55.011
and you really need a
good friend to talk to

16:55.012 --> 16:57.515
'cause you're thinking
about changing the direction of your life?

16:57.516 --> 16:59.216
Yeah.

16:59.267 --> 17:02.019
Could you just hang on
a second, then? Just...

17:04.306 --> 17:07.290
Norm said you
wanted to talk to me?

17:11.029 --> 17:14.047
So, that's when I gave
Dr. Sutton a call.

17:20.021 --> 17:22.823
SAM:
Uh, excuse me.

17:22.874 --> 17:26.760
Is this the meeting
for the... sex thing?

17:26.795 --> 17:28.095
Yes...

17:28.130 --> 17:30.130
the sexual compulsives group.

17:30.165 --> 17:32.499
Yes, I'm Doctor Sutton.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.567
Hi.

17:33.568 --> 17:35.069
Have a seat.
Thank you.

17:35.103 --> 17:37.271
We've just been going
around the room,

17:37.305 --> 17:39.373
telling a little bit
about ourselves.

17:39.374 --> 17:40.858
And why don't we
continue with you?

17:40.859 --> 17:44.060
Let's start with your name.
First name only, please.

17:44.062 --> 17:47.013
All right, uh, (clears throat)

17:47.048 --> 17:50.116
My name is...

17:50.151 --> 17:51.885
Steve.

17:51.953 --> 17:55.171
ALL:
Hi, Steve.

17:55.240 --> 18:00.411
Uh, well, uh,

18:00.413 --> 18:03.063
I'm, I'm starting off
on the wrong foot, here.

18:03.097 --> 18:05.899
Uh, my real name is not Steve.

18:05.934 --> 18:08.635
It's... Bob.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.390
ALL:
Hi, Bob.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.428
I can't believe I'm doing this.

18:17.462 --> 18:20.297
I, uh, I'm really embarrassed.

18:20.348 --> 18:22.700
My name isn't Bob, either.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.602
It's, uh, it's Sam.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.539
No, really, it is.
It's Sam.

18:28.573 --> 18:32.543
ALL:
Hi...Sam.

18:32.577 --> 18:36.997
Well, uh, where to begin?

18:37.082 --> 18:39.883
See, I-I don't, I don't really
have a problem, you know.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.752
It's just that, uh,
my friends think I do.

18:42.787 --> 18:47.391
Uh, see, I've, I've, had
a lot of sex in my life.

18:47.425 --> 18:49.526
We all have.

18:49.544 --> 18:51.278
No, No.

18:54.683 --> 18:56.884
You see, I-I mean a lot.

18:56.968 --> 18:58.852
So do I.

18:58.854 --> 19:00.187
Yeah, all right, wise guy.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.722
I'm writing down a number here.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.327
Sam, I think you're
missing the point.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.030
Sorry.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.517
Uh, well, you know, I don't,

19:13.518 --> 19:15.452
I don't know why they
think I have a problem.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.921
You know, so I have a healthy
sex drive. Big deal.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.606
I mean, what's, what's the big
deal about that, huh?

19:23.078 --> 19:26.246
I mean, uh, you know, granted
it's a big part of my life.

19:26.281 --> 19:30.384
You know, when I'm not having
sex, I'm-I'm thinking about it.

19:30.385 --> 19:33.921
I-I don't want you
to think that I'm, uh,

19:33.922 --> 19:35.522
you know, that I'm, uh,
(clears throat) you know,

19:35.523 --> 19:37.258
that I'm shallow, 'cause I
have other interests, too.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.160
You know, like,
like, like my hair.

19:43.648 --> 19:47.367
The, uh... the babes
really love my hair.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.007
Yeah, I don't know
what the big deal is.

19:53.008 --> 19:54.474
You know, when I was growing up,

19:54.475 --> 19:59.579
it was a sign of-of manhood
how many women you shagged.

19:59.614 --> 20:02.983
I guess I just, uh,
missed the announcement

20:03.018 --> 20:04.968
when they changed the rule.

20:05.002 --> 20:09.223
So, I just kept on doing it.

20:09.225 --> 20:11.441
I- I suppose if
I'm really honest,

20:11.509 --> 20:12.559
that I...

20:12.560 --> 20:16.045
I'm not that happy anymore.

20:16.080 --> 20:21.001
Um, I suppose I'm, I'm, you
know, beginning to realize

20:21.035 --> 20:24.771
that, uh, all that
skirt chasing kept me from

20:24.805 --> 20:27.674
experiencing some of the
good things in life.

20:27.708 --> 20:34.214
Some of the... important things.

20:34.248 --> 20:38.185
Phew. Uh, maybe, uh...

20:38.186 --> 20:39.652
Maybe I'm not here
for my friends.

20:39.653 --> 20:44.757
M-Maybe I am here for myself.

20:48.296 --> 20:50.898
Thank you, Sam. I know
that was difficult for you,

20:50.932 --> 20:53.333
but we're glad you're here.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.668
Uh, who's next?

20:54.702 --> 20:56.170
How about you?

20:56.254 --> 21:01.508
Uh, well, I guess I've had
this problem for a long time.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.159
Excuse me, your name?

21:03.228 --> 21:05.912
Oh, sorry. Rachel.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.565
ALL:
Hi, Rachel.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.386
I guess the root
of my behaviour,

21:12.420 --> 21:15.806
like everybody's, is
my low self-esteem.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.075
I never thought
I was very pretty

21:18.109 --> 21:21.344
or had any particular talent.

21:21.379 --> 21:24.248
The only time I felt
special was when

21:24.250 --> 21:26.016
men were attracted
to me sexually.

21:26.084 --> 21:29.870
And it started out
innocently enough, you know.

21:29.904 --> 21:33.073
I would sleep with a guy on the
first date, every now and then.

21:34.793 --> 21:39.079
But it wasn't long before I was
having a first date every night.

21:39.113 --> 21:43.483
And soon, sex was all
I could think about.

21:43.518 --> 21:46.986
Morning, noon and night.
Seven days a week.

21:46.988 --> 21:49.506
It wasn't enough

21:49.607 --> 21:52.692
as far as quantity,
it had to be dangerous, too.

21:52.727 --> 21:56.830
I would duck into an alleyway
with a guy on the way to work.

21:56.865 --> 21:59.833
Or I'd stop an elevator
between floors.

21:59.868 --> 22:02.769
Sneak a guy into a department
store dressing room.

22:04.706 --> 22:07.307
I would love to put a stop to
this,

22:07.341 --> 22:10.610
because I... I feel like my
appetites are out of control.

22:10.644 --> 22:12.394
I mean, I hunger
for it constantly.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.184
And there is no limit
to how low I'll go.

22:17.218 --> 22:19.986
There's no chance I won't take.

22:20.020 --> 22:24.491
No fantasy I won't fulfill.

22:24.525 --> 22:28.795
My lust controls me
and that's why I'm here.

22:35.070 --> 22:39.873
So, you like Chinese food?
