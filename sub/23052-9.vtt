00:22.856 --> 00:28.069
<i>A red fire burns ablaze,</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.529
<i>Don't lose, stand up,</i>

00:29.612 --> 00:31.031
AUGUST 7TH, 2003 (THURSDAY)

00:31.865 --> 00:37.120
<i>I promise to make the tears stop,</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:41.207
<i>Wonder, Wonder, such a kind heart,</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.586
<i>Embracing you,</i>

00:44.669 --> 00:47.797
<i>His loving heart is his weapon,</i>

00:48.631 --> 00:49.758
<i>A hero who protects--</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.930
Yes, this is what happens with records.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.774
Good morning, Satoru.

02:28.481 --> 02:32.652
We need to avoid risk.
But you can't be afraid of it.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.990
Being able to freely operate
without fearing risk is our advantage.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.119
Is that why you never started a family?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.456
Yeah.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.084
But I don't regret it.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.963
Even if I'm not rewarded for it
anytime soon.

03:02.473 --> 03:05.101
SACHIKO
HE'S AWAKE.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.202
No.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
I'm sure your reward... is coming soon.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.135
Hello?

03:40.136 --> 03:40.970
AUGUST 21ST, 2003 (THURSDAY)

03:41.054 --> 03:43.348
How about we try moving your hand?

03:44.224 --> 03:47.560
First, let's start
by trying to bend both elbows.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.358
Good.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.154
Next, could you try
turning your head my way?

04:02.825 --> 04:04.285
Okay, now the other side.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.251
Good.

04:13.836 --> 04:17.757
I'm impressed to see you move this much
after only being awake for two weeks.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.010
That is thanks to your mother.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.472
She spent four hours every day
taking care of you.

04:25.556 --> 04:30.270
That is why your muscles
haven't atrophied to hopeless levels.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.816
Normally, when you've been asleep
for 15 years...

04:37.694 --> 04:38.695
Fif...

04:40.530 --> 04:41.364
teen... years?

04:51.582 --> 04:52.458
Fif...

04:53.876 --> 04:54.877
teen...

04:55.920 --> 04:56.754
years...

05:00.800 --> 05:03.678
Please bring the results to me
as soon as you get them.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.264
-Yes, doctor.
-Should I take this to the doctor?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.181
AUGUST 25TH, 2003 (MONDAY)

05:20.153 --> 05:23.573
Ma'am, I would like to begin
questioning him.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.617
Is that all right?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.998
Please take good care of him.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.625
Satoru...

05:36.044 --> 05:38.004
before you fell asleep,

05:38.087 --> 05:41.340
what is the newest memory
you can remember?

05:42.800 --> 05:43.760
Newest?

05:44.510 --> 05:48.056
Let me rephrase that.
What's the last thing you remember?

06:04.614 --> 06:05.573
Mom.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.660
Where's my flute?

06:26.094 --> 06:30.598
<i>Even I knew</i>
<i>that this wasn't my last memory.</i>

06:31.682 --> 06:32.892
<i>And it was just then</i>

06:33.768 --> 06:37.855
<i>that I realized for the first time</i>
<i>that there were holes</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:40.441
<i>in my memory.</i>

06:47.406 --> 06:50.409
Then... I think it's time
we have him meet them.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.664
Yes.

07:01.003 --> 07:01.838
Satoru.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.631
You have visitors.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.970
Thank you for waiting.
Please come in.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.647
Satoru.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.565
Good morning.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.735
I'm your old classmate,
Kenya Kobayashi.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.613
I'm Hiromi Sugita.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.825
You look well, Satoru.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.665
You both got old.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.421
-Did you come all the way from Hokkaido?
-No.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.715
We've moved to Tokyo, too.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.758
I see.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.721
So, you're both working in Tokyo now?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.014
Yeah.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.683
I became a lawyer
like I always said I would.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.727
I'm a doctor.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.313
Although, I'm still an intern.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.692
That's really amazing.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.742
-By the way, Satoru, I wanted to ask--
-Kenya!

08:13.075 --> 08:15.161
What would you like to drink?

08:15.912 --> 08:16.829
I'm buying.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.874
That's not necessary.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.501
We should be going, anyway.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.921
We don't want to tire Satoru too much.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.422
Oh, okay.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.425
Well, Satoru... Bye.

08:31.552 --> 08:32.385
Bye.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.074
Thank you for coming all this way
to see him again.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.158
Our pleasure.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.120
Here.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.335
I've compiled everything
that has happened to Satoru.

09:07.338 --> 09:12.051
If someday Satoru wants to know,
I thought it could be useful.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.389
Thank you.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.348
It was nothing.

09:19.350 --> 09:23.980
But... if you decide it's best to
throw it away, I would understand.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.694
You were the one who was able
to get Satoru to wake up, after all.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.117
We will come again.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.408
<i>I distinctly feel like</i>
<i>a piece of me is missing.</i>

10:18.409 --> 10:19.327
<i>But...</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:24.707
<i>if my mother thinks</i>
<i>it should stay forgotten,</i>

10:25.541 --> 10:28.544
<i>then I guess I could live</i>
<i>with never remembering.</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:21.263
Satoru!

11:35.945 --> 11:36.779
Kayo.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.214
Congratulations.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.846
I got married, and I'm Kayo Sugita now.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.472
Sugita?

12:04.807 --> 12:07.935
Wait, did you marry Hiromi?

12:12.815 --> 12:16.652
So, that's why Hiromi looked like
he wanted to tell me something.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.364
What's the baby's name?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.159
Mirai.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.618
Mirai?

12:26.871 --> 12:27.997
That's a good name.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.464
To be honest, some part of me
didn't feel right about it.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.926
Like is it really fair for us
to go on and be happy?

12:42.595 --> 12:47.475
Even when your coma
could have been because of me.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.478
It felt like

12:51.395 --> 12:53.230
we were deserting you.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.318
Kayo.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.739
My fate is my own.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.367
There's no reason
for you to feel responsible.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.872
The reason I'm like this now...

13:11.415 --> 13:13.834
must be the result of something I wanted.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.797
You really are amazing, Satoru.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.593
You've been asleep for 15 years,

13:23.552 --> 13:25.596
but you can still say
something so wonderful.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.682
It's nothing special.

13:30.100 --> 13:30.935
But still...

13:32.686 --> 13:36.190
the reason that little girl
who could only imagine being alone

13:37.274 --> 13:41.111
was able to grow up
to have a family like this...

13:42.613 --> 13:44.281
is because of you, Satoru.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.117
Thank you.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.595
<i>I felt a strange feeling</i>
<i>inside myself,</i>

14:07.638 --> 14:09.807
<i>and I had to look into it.</i>

14:14.019 --> 14:14.853
Yes?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.274
I'd like to try sketching
for my rehabilitation.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.527
Could I borrow a pencil and some paper?

14:21.986 --> 14:24.488
Of course.
I'll get those to you right away.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.665
How am I able to draw a picture like this? How far are you into
the <i>Wonder Guy</i> volumes?

15:30.512 --> 15:31.680
I'm on volume three.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.397
Mom.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.569
You didn't tell Kayo not to talk, did you?

15:47.404 --> 15:48.238
Why not?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.578
I didn't realize you noticed.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.089
To tell you the truth...

16:08.175 --> 16:10.010
after Kenya and Hiromi left...

16:13.931 --> 16:16.225
I felt like I made a mistake.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.814
That they didn't get to say
what they wanted to.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.986
Even though they came to see you
after waiting 15 years.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.829
I was here talking to you every day...

16:41.875 --> 16:44.670
but when you talked back
your voice had changed.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.303
It's the first time I felt
that you'd grown.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.562
I was really happy.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.907
You're an adult already.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.189
Here.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.900
TO MY DEAR FRIEND, SATORU FUJINUMA

17:47.983 --> 17:49.777
Kenya brought it in.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.825
I think... it will tell you
what you want to know.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.580
Are you sure?

18:04.333 --> 18:05.334
To be honest...

18:07.878 --> 18:09.088
I'm a little scared.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.632
But...

18:14.343 --> 18:17.387
when a child
becomes interested in something...

18:19.014 --> 18:21.266
it's the parent's duty to support them.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.297
<i>Satoru.</i>

18:52.840 --> 18:54.133
<i>It could be that</i>

18:54.216 --> 18:58.220
<i>you won't need these files</i>
<i>for your future.</i>

18:58.762 --> 19:03.725
<i>But... if you ever became curious</i>
<i>about what happened to you,</i>

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
<i>I put this together</i>

19:06.520 --> 19:08.480
<i>hoping you'd find it useful.</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:17.489
<i>The day you came into contact</i>
<i>with your own case</i>

19:18.323 --> 19:23.078
<i>was March 14th, 1988.</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:29.459
<i>You were discovered</i>
<i>in a lake near the city.</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:32.045
<i>At around 6:30 p.m...</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:37.593
<i>you were rescued by a veterinarian</i>
<i>passing the area.</i>

19:55.485 --> 19:57.404
<i>You were in cardiac arrest.</i>

19:57.487 --> 19:59.531
<i>Your body temperature</i>
<i>was under 82 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

19:59.615 --> 20:02.743
It's okay! You're okay!
An ambulance is on the way!

20:04.244 --> 20:06.205
Don't give up! Don't give up!

20:20.552 --> 20:21.762
-Doctor.
-Patient's condition?

20:21.845 --> 20:22.804
Mr. Satoru Fujinuma.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.724
JCS level is 100. Breathing is shallow.
We put him on oxygen.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.100
Mr. Fujinuma!

20:27.184 --> 20:30.103
His temperature is 93.2 degrees.
He's experiencing hypothermia.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.240
<i>The hospital's doctor</i>

20:41.323 --> 20:44.868
<i>hypothesized the low water temperature</i>
<i>allowed the brain to enter a state</i>

20:44.952 --> 20:47.537
<i>of suspended animation,</i>
<i>avoiding brain death.</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:52.209
<i>And so...</i>

20:53.293 --> 20:55.504
<i>you slept for 15 years.</i>

21:02.678 --> 21:05.681
<i>Almost ironically, you were able to prove</i>

21:05.764 --> 21:09.518
<i>the serial kidnapper and murderer</i>
<i>you talked about was present in our town</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:11.520
<i>by becoming a victim yourself.</i>

21:14.106 --> 21:15.274
<i>Your case</i>

21:15.857 --> 21:18.986
<i>launched a large investigation</i>
<i>as an attempted murder investigation.</i>

21:23.782 --> 21:24.658
<i>Despite this,</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:28.078
<i>they were unable to find</i>
<i>any leads on a suspect.</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:33.250
<i>But for your case,</i>
<i>there was no suspect to take the fall,</i>

21:33.333 --> 21:35.127
<i>as the killer always</i>
<i>so carefully arranged.</i>

21:36.586 --> 21:38.797
<i>I believe the reason for that is this:</i>

21:39.589 --> 21:43.427
<i>Your very existence</i>
<i>interfered with the killer's plans.</i>

21:48.473 --> 21:51.852
<i>It became difficult to continue</i>
<i>your treatment in Hokkaido.</i>

21:52.352 --> 21:54.354
<i>So, in July of 1989,</i>

21:55.480 --> 21:59.151
<i>you were transferred to a hospital in</i>
<i>Chiba capable of offering long-term care.</i>

22:00.736 --> 22:04.865
<i>But still there was no sign of recovery,</i>
<i>so some time later,</i>

22:05.198 --> 22:07.284
<i>they switched you to home care.</i>

22:34.144 --> 22:39.524
We are raising money
for Satoru Fujinuma's treatment.

22:40.067 --> 22:40.901
Thank you!

22:40.984 --> 22:44.613
We are raising money
for our friend Satoru Fujinuma!

22:44.696 --> 22:45.530
Thank you!

22:45.614 --> 22:49.326
<i>Wanting to help any way we could,</i>
<i>we started collecting donations.</i>

22:50.368 --> 22:52.871
<i>We actually still do this even now.</i>

22:56.041 --> 22:58.668
<i>Does it sound like</i>
<i>I'm asking for a thank-you?</i>

22:58.752 --> 22:59.920
<i>Believe me, I'm not.</i>

23:00.754 --> 23:01.588
<i>Back then,</i>

23:02.672 --> 23:04.299
<i>you were our hero.</i>

23:06.134 --> 23:07.803
<i>We wanted to catch up to you.</i>

23:08.553 --> 23:10.388
<i>We wanted to fight with you.</i> <i>You helped us become who we are.</i>

23:18.980 --> 23:20.982
YOUR FRIEND, KENYA KOBAYASHI

23:32.536 --> 23:34.496
<i>It's the first time I learned</i>

23:35.122 --> 23:36.748
<i>how good it feels...</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:39.417
<i>to not be alone.</i>

23:43.463 --> 23:47.050
<i>I more or less understood</i>
<i>what happened to me in the past.</i>

23:48.051 --> 23:51.596
<i>But... there are memories</i>
<i>I can't remember</i>

23:52.639 --> 23:54.266
<i>that aren't written in here.</i>

24:00.105 --> 24:02.440
COURTESY OF THE
NISHIFUNABASHI CITY COUNCIL

24:28.049 --> 24:32.387
<i>I better make it to the end,</i>
<i>or I'll lose face.</i>

24:49.988 --> 24:52.699
That was really amazing, mister!

25:00.999 --> 25:05.337
I see, Kumi.
So, your surgery is next month.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.882
They said that will fix me.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.886
But, you know, I'm scared.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.143
Then do you want me to tell you
the secret to being brave?

25:20.769 --> 25:21.603
What?

25:22.312 --> 25:25.357
You imagine the smile
of someone important to you.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.735
Of course, you have to smile, too.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.115
Okay.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.659
I'll try it.

25:40.163 --> 25:43.250
His body is grown,
but his mind is still a child's.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.086
I like the sound of that!

25:46.169 --> 25:47.796
This was worth the trouble!

25:50.090 --> 25:52.050
What the hell are you doing?!

25:57.597 --> 26:00.976
You stupid?
Don't force that nonsense on the camera.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.062
The camera doesn't lie.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.502
I'm sorry for the commotion.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.465
<i>How is it possible?</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:35.593
<i>I know this girl somehow.</i>

26:37.887 --> 26:39.139
<i>Don't let her leave.</i>

26:40.140 --> 26:41.016
<i>Talk to her.</i> Thank you.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.526
I should be the one apologizing.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.280
Are you okay?

26:56.698 --> 27:00.201
He's the one at fault.
So, I don't think he'd press charges.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.870
I mean your hand.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.042
It hurts a little.
I punched him real hard.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.502
But my motto is to go all in

27:09.586 --> 27:12.339
when I see something happening
in front of me.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.674
Go all in...?

27:16.843 --> 27:18.595
That's a really nice motto.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.013
What? Really?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.684
There aren't many people
who would say that.

27:25.769 --> 27:29.439
I just can't stand anyone
using the camera like that.

27:33.109 --> 27:35.278
I have a dream!

27:36.071 --> 27:38.281
<i>You have to ask her about it.</i>

27:38.948 --> 27:40.241
What is your dream?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.620
I want to take pictures!

27:44.913 --> 27:46.206
I really love the sky.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.501
I'd go all over Japan,
or all around the world,

27:49.584 --> 27:51.795
just traveling with my camera.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.361
Airi...

28:19.072 --> 28:20.115
Mister?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.660
What's wrong, mister?

28:23.743 --> 28:25.203
-What's wrong?
-Mister!

28:25.286 --> 28:28.164
-Are you okay, can you hear me?
-Are you okay? Mister!

28:28.248 --> 28:30.500
-Are you okay? Are you okay?
-Mister?
