the first to see the all-new</i>

27:06.039 --> 27:08.874
<i>Skull Island: Reign of
Kong attraction in person.</i>

27:08.908 --> 27:09.875
Very cool.

27:09.909 --> 27:11.176
Without further ado,

27:11.211 --> 27:13.479
let's take a look at your creations.

27:13.513 --> 27:16.482
<i>[intense music]</i>

27:37.470 --> 27:39.238
<i>I think she looks really cool.</i>

27:39.272 --> 27:42.274
<i>She's feminine, even though
she's this big, creepy bug.</i>

27:42.308 --> 27:44.143
<i>I don't know what the
judges are gonna say,</i>

27:44.177 --> 27:45.878
but I'm proud of what I've done today.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.101
<i>Overall, he's looking cool.</i>

28:09.135 --> 28:10.135
<i>He's looking creepy.</i>

28:10.170 --> 28:11.803
But I don't know if this is enough

28:11.838 --> 28:14.873
to get me in the finale.

28:35.828 --> 28:37.963
<i>He's got this really unique look</i>

28:37.997 --> 28:39.598
<i>that draws your
eye in to his face.</i>

28:39.632 --> 28:41.500
I don't know. I think it's really cool.

29:03.122 --> 29:04.856
<i>I don't like this makeup.</i>

29:04.891 --> 29:07.426
It would definitely suck to
be knocked out of the finale

29:07.460 --> 29:09.962
on a bad paint job.

29:15.268 --> 29:16.435
All right, judges.

29:16.469 --> 29:18.403
It's time to go take a closer look.

29:24.244 --> 29:27.312
Mel has done a lot of work here.

29:27.347 --> 29:28.513
She's really elegant.

29:28.548 --> 29:32.351
Turn that way so we can look at your tail.

29:32.385 --> 29:34.086
That's pretty good.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.222
Yeah, back to the front.

29:37.257 --> 29:39.658
I really wish this rough
shape around the mouth

29:39.692 --> 29:45.097
had been synthesized
with the performer's face.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.598
[growls]

29:46.633 --> 29:47.799
[chuckling]

29:47.834 --> 29:49.701
That's my favorite creature noise ever.

29:49.736 --> 29:50.936
Really nice paint work.

29:50.970 --> 29:52.337
Some good blending down here too.

29:52.372 --> 29:53.672
Yeah.

29:53.706 --> 29:55.674
I think this would have
been a lot more successful

29:55.708 --> 29:57.242
if they had been folded up on his back.

29:57.277 --> 29:58.910
- Exactly.
- It would have looked cooler.

29:58.945 --> 30:02.080
It would have been faster to do.

30:02.115 --> 30:03.949
There's some really accomplished forms

30:03.983 --> 30:04.983
going on through here.

30:05.018 --> 30:06.885
And a whole lot of them to reconcile.

30:06.919 --> 30:08.553
God, she did a lot of stuff

30:08.588 --> 30:10.555
and painted everything
pretty decently too.

30:10.590 --> 30:11.690
Mm-hmm.

30:11.724 --> 30:13.358
My favorite part of the fabrication

30:13.393 --> 30:15.761
is these really working
in the third dimension.

30:15.795 --> 30:17.596
[whispers] Yeah.

30:17.630 --> 30:20.365
He didn't do well with
painting all these horns.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.933
There's one huge mistake,

30:21.968 --> 30:23.635
and it's leaving all this exposed,

30:23.670 --> 30:25.437
not covering these with anything.

30:25.471 --> 30:27.339
Bringing this stuff up here to cover this

30:27.373 --> 30:28.807
would help so much.

30:28.841 --> 30:32.678
This is the most incomplete
makeup I've put onstage,

30:32.712 --> 30:35.580
<i>and this is the worst
time to have that happen.</i>

30:35.615 --> 30:36.982
Why didn't he cover that up?

30:37.016 --> 30:39.785
<i>I'm really hoping it
doesn't blow my shot</i>

30:39.819 --> 30:42.489
at getting to the finale.

30:45.295 --> 30:46.829
Why didn't he cover that up?

30:46.864 --> 30:51.734
This is the most incomplete
makeup I've put onstage.

30:51.768 --> 30:53.169
<i>I hope they notice</i>

30:53.203 --> 30:55.071
<i>that this is a sculpture
I'm really proud of</i>

30:55.105 --> 30:57.440
and overlook the fact that this
is a paint job I'm really not.

30:57.474 --> 30:58.908
Bringing this stuff up here

30:58.942 --> 31:00.476
to cover this would help so much.

31:00.511 --> 31:02.945
- Otherwise, gorgeous sculpturing.
- Yeah.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.747
Thank you.

31:07.751 --> 31:10.786
All right, the judges would
like to hear from each of you

31:10.821 --> 31:13.923
before choosing this season's finalists.

31:13.957 --> 31:16.359
Walter, will you please step forward?

31:16.393 --> 31:19.362
<i>[intense music]</i>

31:25.002 --> 31:26.769
- Hey, Walter.
- How's it going?

31:26.803 --> 31:28.538
Tell us about the
genesis of your creature.

31:28.572 --> 31:32.008
I wanted him to have
evolved for better fighting,

31:32.042 --> 31:36.679
so I figured instead of making
wings attached to his arms,

31:36.713 --> 31:38.181
I would make separate wings

31:38.215 --> 31:39.782
so that he could fight with his hands

31:39.816 --> 31:42.285
but also be flying at the same time.

31:42.319 --> 31:46.155
It's a really impressive character.

31:46.190 --> 31:49.292
Some of the facial forms of
the sculpting, really cool.

31:49.326 --> 31:50.526
I think a couple of dark tones

31:50.561 --> 31:52.361
coming around from the
back would have helped.

31:52.396 --> 31:53.796
I love that you try to push yourself,

31:53.830 --> 31:55.264
that you're swinging for the fences,

31:55.299 --> 31:56.699
especially here in the semifinals.

31:56.733 --> 31:57.867
Thank you.

31:57.901 --> 31:59.468
Your character has a lot of nice tones.

31:59.503 --> 32:01.370
I especially like what
you did around the eyes,

32:01.405 --> 32:03.139
and there's some really beautiful moments,

32:03.173 --> 32:04.273
like in the ear,

32:04.308 --> 32:05.841
and you have some nice veining going on.

32:05.876 --> 32:08.077
But it would have been better
if those wings were not up.

32:08.111 --> 32:09.679
You should have just
tied the buggers down.

32:09.713 --> 32:10.913
Yeah.

32:10.948 --> 32:12.648
I think that the most successful thing

32:12.683 --> 32:14.116
you've achieved here is the fact that

32:14.151 --> 32:16.385
it feels like this could
be in the Kong world.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.387
My favorite feature on this guy

32:18.422 --> 32:20.356
is definitely the orbital region.

32:20.390 --> 32:22.992
There's some really cool
shapes happening there.

32:23.026 --> 32:25.895
I'm glad to see that
shadow is highlighting that.

32:25.929 --> 32:27.063
I'm loving what you're doing.

32:27.097 --> 32:28.397
Thank you.

32:28.432 --> 32:29.665
Walter, you can head back.

32:34.137 --> 32:36.339
Mel, please step up.

32:41.945 --> 32:42.979
Good evening, Mel.

32:43.013 --> 32:44.347
Good evening, Ve.

32:44.381 --> 32:46.349
Tell us about your Skull Island creation.

32:46.383 --> 32:49.318
In evolution, they became bipeds,

32:49.353 --> 32:50.720
walking on two feet.

32:50.754 --> 32:53.389
So this part is actually fashioned

32:53.423 --> 32:55.391
from what they've evolved from.

32:55.425 --> 32:57.260
They've taken that and made it into armor.

32:57.294 --> 32:58.527
Cool idea.

32:58.562 --> 33:01.464
I mean, she's so elegant.

33:01.498 --> 33:03.499
The distance read is a
little muddy, facially,

33:03.533 --> 33:04.967
but when you get up close, it's nice.

33:05.002 --> 33:06.769
I like the little bits
of red here and there.

33:06.803 --> 33:08.537
You've really stepped up on this one.

33:08.572 --> 33:09.805
Thank you.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.907
- This is pretty darn cool.
- Thanks.

33:11.942 --> 33:13.643
The mouth, it's subtle from a distance,

33:13.677 --> 33:15.911
but up close, it gets even more appealing.

33:15.946 --> 33:18.848
But if you had maybe broken
up the face a little bit

33:18.882 --> 33:20.116
with a bit more specularity,

33:20.150 --> 33:21.684
that would have helped, I think, showcase

33:21.718 --> 33:23.953
more of the beautiful sculptural
form you have happening

33:23.987 --> 33:24.954
on that face.

33:24.988 --> 33:25.955
Thank you.

33:25.989 --> 33:27.356
The way that your fabrication

33:27.391 --> 33:30.226
integrates with the character is gorgeous.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.428
My one tripping point here

33:32.462 --> 33:34.764
is the mouth should have been synthesized

33:34.798 --> 33:36.899
into the human nature of the performer,

33:36.933 --> 33:38.701
but I love the shapes of it.

33:38.735 --> 33:39.702
Thank you.

33:39.736 --> 33:41.237
Mel, please step back.

33:41.271 --> 33:44.707
<i>♪ ♪</i>

33:44.741 --> 33:46.275
- Good job.
- Thanks.

33:46.310 --> 33:49.312
Rob, please step to the center.

33:56.153 --> 33:57.119
- Hello, Rob.
- Hi.

33:57.154 --> 33:58.821
Tell us about your concept.

33:58.855 --> 34:00.923
As the creature evolved,
it shrank in size,

34:00.957 --> 34:03.125
so it adapted to mimicking

34:03.160 --> 34:06.128
and camouflaging to survive, basically.

34:06.163 --> 34:10.433
You've really done an exceptional job.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.702
You're so damn good at sculpting.

34:12.735 --> 34:15.571
To have scales morph across a surface

34:15.605 --> 34:18.306
from primary to secondary to tertiary,

34:18.342 --> 34:23.245
that takes an awareness
that is an innate skill set,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.880
but watch out for the big shapes, though,

34:25.916 --> 34:27.483
because the profile of this is terrible.

34:27.516 --> 34:28.516
Okay.

34:28.552 --> 34:29.952
It's a visual feast.

34:29.985 --> 34:33.322
Delicious sculptural detail,
so awesome work there,

34:33.357 --> 34:34.657
but when you have a sculpt

34:34.690 --> 34:36.092
that's that beautiful with detail,

34:36.126 --> 34:38.260
you really need to give yourself the time

34:38.295 --> 34:42.264
to allow the paint to help show
off how great the detail is.

34:42.299 --> 34:43.998
I just wish you would have
brought the wardrobe up

34:44.034 --> 34:46.135
to hide some of the
sins of the application.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.471
- Other than that, great work.
- Thank you.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.005
I'm sorry that you didn't
take your airbrush at the end

34:51.041 --> 34:52.608
and just give a couple of little pops

34:52.641 --> 34:54.543
on some of that beautiful
sculpting that you did.

34:54.578 --> 34:55.543
I really would have liked

34:55.579 --> 34:58.881
to have seen it painted beautifully.

34:58.915 --> 35:00.116
Rob, thank you very much.

35:00.150 --> 35:01.517
Please head back.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.491
Melissa.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.600
- Hey, Melissa.
- Hi, Glenn.

35:17.634 --> 35:19.068
Tell us about your concept.

35:19.102 --> 35:21.771
For their evolution, they
are scavenger creatures,

35:21.805 --> 35:25.141
so they became smarter
and started building traps

35:25.175 --> 35:27.109
to capture fresh food.

35:27.144 --> 35:29.812
It's a gorgeous makeup.

35:29.846 --> 35:31.947
I think there's a
really harmonious balance

35:31.982 --> 35:34.116
between the amount of time
that you spent fabricating

35:34.151 --> 35:36.018
and the amount of time
you spent on a makeup.

35:36.052 --> 35:38.788
I wish that those attenuated feelers

35:38.822 --> 35:40.856
were in a slightly different position.

35:40.891 --> 35:42.691
They sort of hang down over his eyes.

35:42.726 --> 35:46.595
That's a tiny note on an
otherwise great makeup.

35:46.630 --> 35:47.997
This is a pretty cool character.

35:48.031 --> 35:50.166
I especially love the paint scheme.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.500
Really nice colors,

35:51.535 --> 35:52.902
With those beautiful warm browns

35:52.936 --> 35:54.370
and that little bit of red in there.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.605
All of these beautiful sculptural pieces

35:56.640 --> 35:58.007
around the mouth, and it all works.

35:58.041 --> 35:59.775
When he moves, it goes in and out.

35:59.810 --> 36:01.477
Very nice job tonight, Melissa.

36:01.511 --> 36:02.545
Thank you.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.013
There's so much good stuff here.

36:04.047 --> 36:06.916
This chest piece is
beautiful in so many ways.

36:06.950 --> 36:08.918
The third dimension coming out is great.

36:08.952 --> 36:11.253
Bottom line, you have a complete character

36:11.288 --> 36:12.588
that's aesthetically pleasing.

36:12.622 --> 36:13.856
Very nice work.

36:13.890 --> 36:14.857
Thank you.

36:14.891 --> 36:15.925
Thank you, everyone.

36:15.959 --> 36:17.393
Melissa, please step back.

36:22.632 --> 36:24.834
All right, you can all
head back to the makeup room

36:24.868 --> 36:28.737
while the judges decide who
will move on to the finale.

36:36.146 --> 36:37.146
All right, judges.

36:37.180 --> 36:39.615
So you have some big decisions to make.

36:39.649 --> 36:41.884
Why don't we start with Walter?

36:41.918 --> 36:43.519
<i>You know, he had some
nice vein work in there.</i>

36:43.553 --> 36:45.221
<i>He had some beautiful
shading around the eyes.</i>

36:45.255 --> 36:47.623
<i>Some really great stuff over
on the sides by the ears.</i>

36:47.657 --> 36:49.758
<i>There's some things about
it that I really do like.</i>

36:49.793 --> 36:52.328
I don't think that it's his best effort.

36:52.362 --> 36:54.897
The sculpting got a
little soft for my taste.

36:54.931 --> 36:57.433
It's immediately recognizable,

36:57.467 --> 36:59.301
<i>and he's very strong conceptually.</i>

36:59.336 --> 37:00.936
<i>This guy has a vision.</i>

37:00.971 --> 37:04.006
That's such an important
piece of the criteria

37:04.040 --> 37:06.175
moving someone forward to the finale.

37:06.209 --> 37:08.310
All right, let's move on to Mel.

37:08.345 --> 37:10.546
<i>The paint application's very nice.</i>

37:10.580 --> 37:12.748
<i>She's shown beautiful
application technique.</i>

37:12.782 --> 37:14.250
<i>I don't love the forms, though.</i>

37:14.284 --> 37:15.551
They're so primary.

37:15.585 --> 37:17.920
I really did like the form language

37:17.954 --> 37:20.556
<i>in its simplicity, its uniqueness,</i>

37:20.590 --> 37:21.891
<i>and its symmetry.</i>

37:21.925 --> 37:23.359
I felt it was very bold.

37:23.393 --> 37:25.327
This is the best thing
she's done on the show yet.

37:25.362 --> 37:27.630
All right, let's move on to Rob.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.798
<i>He had very poor time management.</i>

37:29.833 --> 37:31.300
<i>The paint job is unfinished.</i>

37:31.334 --> 37:33.736
<i>That yellow chest was just blank.</i>

37:33.770 --> 37:36.539
But absolutely gorgeous
detailing on the sculpture.

37:36.573 --> 37:39.208
<i>It's unbelievable that
someone at his age</i>

37:39.242 --> 37:41.110
<i>would have a skill set
that allows him to pull off</i>

37:41.144 --> 37:42.211
<i>that kind of detail.</i>

37:42.245 --> 37:45.080
The overall shape was more dog-like,

37:45.115 --> 37:48.150
<i>but the precision and the
definition of the scales</i>

37:48.184 --> 37:49.251
<i>astound me.</i>
