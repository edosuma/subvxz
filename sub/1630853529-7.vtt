WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:09.385
Bro, the Internet
is going apeshit

00:09.468 --> 00:11.137
for this Latrine henchman tee.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.431
- Fuck Brian forever.
- Sick.
- Oh...

00:13.514 --> 00:15.349
Hey, guys, guys, Spirit Chair's
taking the podium.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.393
- Let's show her
some respect, huh?

00:19.478 --> 00:21.397
Good morning, Fairfax!

00:21.480 --> 00:23.315
- What the heck is up,
Hypebeasts?

00:23.399 --> 00:26.902
Is everybody totally stoked
for Friday night's dance?

00:26.986 --> 00:29.530
- Yeah, you are!

00:30.740 --> 00:32.324
A-go, Fairfax, go, Fairfax.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.162
You spoke and we listened.

00:36.245 --> 00:40.332
The theme of this year's
dance is...

00:40.416 --> 00:42.626
Peace in the Middle East!

00:44.670 --> 00:46.213
Nah, nah, no, it isn't.

00:46.297 --> 00:47.631
Wait, but-but you said we could.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.592
I said sit your woke ass down.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.010
Ain't nobody getting busy
to J Balvin

00:51.093 --> 00:52.678
over some Aleppo sliders.

00:52.762 --> 00:56.432
The real theme of Friday's dance
is Westy-World, y'all.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.647
That's right. I'm-a turn the gym
into a trap house carnival.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.441
Quattro, call every bird
we know.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.819
'Cause this about to be
the biggest party of the year.

01:25.336 --> 01:28.214
Hey, yo, with Cody gone,
clout king is anyone's game.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.591
This is my year, fam.
We're talking sponsorships,

01:30.674 --> 01:33.302
ad revenue,
Illuminati Christmas party.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.763
Stick with me and we'll be
verified in no time.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.350
The only thing I'm
verifying is my love for Lily.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.186
- Hmm.
- Okay.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.355
Step one, tell her
how I feel at the dance.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.981
Step two, go camping at Zion.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.734
And step three, finally birth
a baby deer together.

01:48.818 --> 01:52.196
Man, how the fuck does Dale
have bigger balls than me?

01:52.279 --> 01:54.865
You know what? Screw it, if Dale
can tell Lily how he feels,

01:54.949 --> 01:57.409
I can turn Melody's
cold shoulder into a warm one.

01:57.493 --> 01:58.994
I'm just excited
to bring my girl

01:59.078 --> 02:00.996
and my gang gang
together as one.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.082
I really think you guys
are gonna hit it off.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.542
We're excited, too, Tru.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.585
I'm learning JavaScript
on Duolingo

02:06.669 --> 02:08.045
so I can speak her language.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.172
That means so much.
She hates code-switching.

02:10.256 --> 02:11.757
So, what,
you're just gonna dance

02:11.841 --> 02:13.175
with a phone in your pocket
all night?

02:13.259 --> 02:14.218
- What?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.929
Trust, bro,
I got something planned.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.597
It ain't gonna be
nothing like that.

02:18.681 --> 02:21.183
You just wait and see,
you guys are gonna freak.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.935
Yo, it's gonna be

02:23.018 --> 02:24.436
the best night ever, boo.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.188
We got a pregame photo op
at Dale's,

02:26.272 --> 02:27.940
then gang gang limo ride,

02:28.023 --> 02:29.525
then we're back at Dale's
for a sleepover,

02:29.608 --> 02:32.987
then Grant's gonna take us
to IHOP in the morning.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.906
<i>Wow. That's a lot of time</i>
<i>with the gang gang.</i>

02:35.990 --> 02:39.535
<i>Can't we just be, like,</i>
<i>a real couple for once?</i>

02:39.618 --> 02:42.079
<i>You know, just the two of us?</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:43.414
Yeah. We will, girl.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.583
Whenever the gang gang
takes a bathroom break.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.710
- Oh, come on, baby.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.087
I was playing.
Don't go sleep mode on me.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.631
You my juicy boo,
you my juicy boo.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.425
It's Cerise and Tru, come on.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.011
Oh, there she is.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.014
<i>I just want my Tru-boo</i>
<i>all to myself sometimes.</i>

03:00.097 --> 03:01.640
I feel the same way, baby.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.976
But I just want my gang gang
to fall in love with you

03:04.059 --> 03:05.436
like how I fell
in love with you.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.771
Just think,
my girl and my homeys?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.815
Come on, now,
that's the ultimate collab.

03:09.899 --> 03:13.402
<i>Okay, anything</i>
<i>for my main squeeze.</i>

03:13.485 --> 03:14.904
Hey, that's my girl.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.907
Now, let's get ready
for your big debut.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.913
"What's up, Melody?"

03:27.374 --> 03:29.251
- Oh...

03:49.855 --> 03:52.358
Diego, you're voting for me
for clout king, right?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.526
Don't forget who hooked it up
with those Jordan 5s.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.861
Why isn't Truman here yet?

03:55.945 --> 03:57.363
The dance starts
in, like, 20 minutes

03:57.446 --> 03:59.198
and I'm already sweating through
my first shirt of the night.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.367
Rubins are
notorious perspirators.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.826
That's why my dad
sleeps in the nude.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.370
Speaking of Truman, you guys,

04:04.453 --> 04:07.164
we got to be super supportive
of him and Cerise tonight, okay?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.625
You got it, D.
That's what the gang gang does.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.251
- Gang gang.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.587
- Hey...
- Hey! Truman. There he is.
- There's my man.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.507
Introducing the new
and improved Cerise.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.557
- What the fuck?

04:25.641 --> 04:28.602
<i>Hey, gang gang.</i>
<i>I am so juiced to meet you guys.</i>

04:28.686 --> 04:30.270
<i>You must be Benny.</i>

04:33.649 --> 04:34.692
My Kruegers!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.527
I'm so sorry, dawg.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.362
She didn't mean it, I promise.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.780
<i>I swear it was an accident.</i>

04:39.863 --> 04:41.365
<i>It's my first time on wheels.</i>

04:41.448 --> 04:43.200
<i>Ugh. Can I order you</i>
<i>shoe cleaner?</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:44.785
It's cool. It's cool.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.787
I'm just gonna go do
a quick Headspace

04:46.870 --> 04:48.998
and I'll be right back.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.583
Cerise, I can't tell you
how good it feels

04:51.667 --> 04:53.127
to finally have another girl
in the group.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.671
Also, I have a ton of charging
cables in the fanny

04:55.754 --> 04:56.880
in case you need extra juice.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.465
No pun intended.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.551
<i>Aw, you guys are so sweet.</i>

05:00.634 --> 05:02.678
- Whoa!

05:04.263 --> 05:08.100
Your chariot awaits, me lords
and ladies... Holy shit!

05:08.183 --> 05:11.520
I mean, uh, you, uh,
you must be Truman's girlfriend.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.147
So nice to meet you.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.983
Holy cow, Dad.
This limo is bitching.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.652
- Isn't it bitching, guys?
- <i>Totally bitching.</i>

05:18.736 --> 05:20.571
<i>For a vehicle that no longer</i>
<i>meets EPA standards</i>

05:20.654 --> 05:22.781
<i>because of its contributions</i>
<i>to ozone depletion.</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:23.991
Uh...

05:24.074 --> 05:25.034
Are you insinuating my dad

05:25.117 --> 05:26.660
doesn't care about
Mother Naytch?

05:26.744 --> 05:28.412
Hey, babe,
appreciate the eco-tip,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.748
but I just think maybe we should
let Dale have this moment.

05:30.831 --> 05:35.210
<i>Of course. Limos are such</i>
<i>a fun school dance clich√©.</i>

05:43.385 --> 05:46.388
Honey, I'm gonna take the kids
and their Roomba to the dance.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.724
I'll be back in 20
with pad thai.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.060
- [

05:53.687 --> 05:55.981
Son of a bitch.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.862
That box tee with my face on it
is a beautifully designed

06:01.945 --> 06:04.698
and tastefully curated kick
to the nads.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.409
We have to respond.
Even my fishies agree.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.579
Broller coaster, don't be mad,

06:10.662 --> 06:12.414
but maybe we should
lay low for a bit.

06:12.498 --> 06:16.502
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not trust
your brother/elder twin?

06:16.585 --> 06:20.172
Of course I do. I'm just
worried about you, Bri-Guy.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.967
You're right. I need to squash
this beef, Arby's style.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.179
- With extra cheddy.
- Classic HR stuff.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.349
You know, this reminds me
of when Dion from Refrigeration

06:30.432 --> 06:32.476
had a little tiff with Miguel
in Home Theater.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.728
- It turned out...
- That's it. 'Form him.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.730
- On it. Sorry, sweetie.
- Chloroform? No, no.

06:38.857 --> 06:43.445
Now, arrange a meeting
with Hiroki.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.614
- [ <i>Same squad, same squad,</i>
<i>same squad...</i>

06:45.697 --> 06:47.616
This is so dope.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.159
Cerise, you comfy?

06:49.243 --> 06:51.745
<i>So comf, Tru-boo.</i>

06:51.829 --> 06:53.580
You look so <i>foine</i> tonight, babe.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.416
You guys,
doesn't Cerise look <i>foine?</i>

06:56.500 --> 06:59.753
Yeah, you can barely tell
she's a mop on a Roomba.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.797
- No, what he means is,

07:01.880 --> 07:03.882
yeah, you can barely tell
you're new to this,

07:03.966 --> 07:06.093
- 'cause you're such a natural.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

07:06.176 --> 07:08.303
<i>And, Derica, you're such</i>
<i>a natural at tracking down</i>

07:08.387 --> 07:10.889
<i>discontinued shades</i>
<i>of Girlbossier foundation.</i>

07:10.973 --> 07:13.767
D! You're wearing Girlbossier
and you ain't sharing?

07:13.851 --> 07:16.520
Okay, fine. Ha, ha.
I'm wearing their concealer.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.647
But only because I have
this horrific pimple,

07:18.730 --> 07:20.524
and I didn't want
anyone to notice,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.985
but now we're all talking
about it, so thanks.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.820
Hey, it's cool, D.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.655
Everybody gets a pass.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.115
- Right, babe?
- <i>Of course.</i>

07:28.198 --> 07:29.491
<i>I've mastered girl code.</i>

07:29.575 --> 07:31.994
<i>My nonexistent lips are sealed.</i>

07:32.077 --> 07:34.329
Wow-ee, you guys, look.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.666
- Oh, my God.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.626
Yo.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.546
The king of debt
has done it again.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.509
<i>Boo, let's take</i>
<i>a sexy selfie together.</i>

07:47.593 --> 07:50.721
You read my mind, baby.
You guys, get in this shot.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
<i>All of us?</i>

07:51.889 --> 07:53.432
- Cheese!
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

07:53.515 --> 07:55.517
- Gang gang.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.104
It's clout time, baby.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.565
- Let's fucking go!

08:06.904 --> 08:09.531
Welcome to Westy-World,
motherfu...

08:09.615 --> 08:11.158
I mean, students.

08:11.241 --> 08:15.579
Y'all ready to get your dicks
wet... I mean, party?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.998
This party is cracking.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.917
A'ight, gang,
what do we want to do first?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.127
They got
the Guess Westy's Debt booth,

08:22.211 --> 08:24.755
Pin the Booty
on Mrs. Weston. Oh.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.342
We definitely got to hit up the
Zillow Mortgage Bounce Haus.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.677
Sorry, Tru,
I got a date with destiny.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.596
And there's my queen now.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.890
Wish me luck.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.892
Ooh, I see Melody.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.144
I wonder what
her hair smells like.

08:39.228 --> 08:40.854
I'm gonna go find out. Bye.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.024
Hmm. Benny?
How about you, me and Cerise

08:44.107 --> 08:46.318
hit the henna face tat staysh?

08:46.401 --> 08:49.238
Get some matching Gucci Mane
ice cream tattoos?

08:49.321 --> 08:51.698
Dawg, you know ice cream rules
everything around me,

08:51.782 --> 08:53.283
but I got to start mingling
with these people

08:53.367 --> 08:55.494
before the polls
close in an hour.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.247
<i>And then there were two.</i>

08:59.957 --> 09:01.291
Lily?

09:01.375 --> 09:02.918
- Lily?

09:03.001 --> 09:05.963
Excuse me, sorry.
Hey, hey, Lily.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.215
Lil, I have something
super important to tell you.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.716
Yeah, me, too.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.890
Whoa, whoa.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.392
You on the list?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.352
Uh, no, but...

09:20.435 --> 09:21.979
Come on, Derica.
Let's just fast-forward

09:22.062 --> 09:24.147
to the part where we drag
you out of here.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.322
Hans Kim.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.907
Heard you got a trampoline.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.868
Say, have you cast your vote
for clout king?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.830
Uh, sorry, Benny.
Jules already got to me.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.541
He hooked it up with
a $20 gift card to Chipotle.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.126
What the fuck?

09:44.209 --> 09:48.463
<i>but I know...</i>

09:48.547 --> 09:51.717
<i>Thanks for making me feel like</i>
<i>a real girl tonight, Tru-boo.</i>

09:51.800 --> 09:54.011
Hey, you're the realest
person here, babe.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.388
I wouldn't trade you
for all the juice in the world.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.182
<i>I love it when we jam,</i>
<i>just the two of us.</i>

09:59.266 --> 10:02.019
<i>When I'm with you, it's like</i>
<i>the whole world melts away.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:03.645
- Mmm... What the...?
- Yo.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.230
This dance fucking sucks.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.692
Yo, what? What happened, bro?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.737
Jules is straight-up bribing
kids with diarrhea gift cards.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.489
And Melody's in the Fort Knox
of VIP booths.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.158
There's no way I can get to her.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.827
Tell me about it, D. It's like
Schwimmer's over there.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.829
You got to get in line
and take a number.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.205
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.333

10:24.416 --> 10:25.834
Hey. Uh-uh, wait a second.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.212
Y'all are just gonna give up
after one try? Come on.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.340
If I had given up on Cerise
after she catfished me

10:31.423 --> 10:33.884
at Chernobyl Fest,
we wouldn't be here right now.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.012
<i>Yeah, I don't know if you can</i>
<i>really compare our situations.</i>

10:37.095 --> 10:39.056
Hey, you know what?
We're gonna help you.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.850
<i>Wait, we are? But, Tru...</i>

10:41.933 --> 10:44.978
Babe, if you help them with this
they're gonna stan you forever.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.231
It's perfect, y'all.
Cerise is a genius, for real.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.609
She's like
the hotter version of Google.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.028
Wait, really, Cerise?
You would do that for us?

10:58.325 --> 11:01.453
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>I would love to help you.</i>

11:01.536 --> 11:03.205
<i>It would be my p-p-pleasure.</i>

11:08.960 --> 11:10.128
Here.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.506
Ugh, where the "F" is he?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.758
I'm right here, bitch.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.231
Okay, listen, my liege...
I mean, Hiroki. Fuck!

11:31.566 --> 11:33.735
Look, I asked you here because
I want to squash this beef

11:33.819 --> 11:35.153
once and for all.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.072
Oh, I'm all for squashing beef.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.075
I just have one caveat.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.412
I want you to leave Fairfax.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.623
Melrose, La Brea, Sunset.

11:46.706 --> 11:52.546

I care, but Fairfax is mine.

Hey. I love your suit.
It's so beige.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.155
Oh, thanks.
My dad got married in it.

You did it, Cerise.

Billie Eilish loves
the tennis ball shoes.

You know, you talk
a big game for someone

16:19.437 --> 16:21.815

into a home for clout fatigue.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.193
That's right.
He fucking fatigued that ass.

super VIP section, or...

I like you, too, Dale.

I guess call me a grizzly bear,

Just come find me after?

18:29.359 --> 18:30.527
Benny,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.238
this better be
the most important fucking thing

18:33.321 --> 18:35.073
- in the world.
- For real, man.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.574
I was about to French.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.701
Yo, we need to talk
about Cerise.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.495
Dude, I was so wrong about her.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.247
- She is incredible.
- Yeah.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.582
She's like an angel
sent from fruit snack heaven.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.252
She's fucking evil, you guys!

18:47.335 --> 18:49.254
- Huh?
- Nah, B.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.589
Look, I thought so, too,
at first, but I was hella wrong.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.050
She's a little kooky
'cause she's a computer program,

18:54.133 --> 18:55.426
but she's not evil.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.178
You were 100% right.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.931
- How do you know?
- Dawg, she's
a master manipulator.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.307
Don't you see?

19:01.391 --> 19:02.600
This whole fucking night

19:02.684 --> 19:04.519
was just her plan
to get rid of us.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.980
Okay, guys, I think
we got to just talk to Truman

19:07.063 --> 19:08.106
and clear this all up.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.357
Uh, I don't know.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.733
If we confront him about Cerise,

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
he might flip out on us again.

19:12.735 --> 19:17.240
Look at me. She is
a fucking psycho robot bitch!

19:17.323 --> 19:19.701
<i>Did someone say</i>
<i>"psycho robot bitch"?</i>

19:19.784 --> 19:21.369
- You.

Tell them.
You're trying to break up

19:23.246 --> 19:25.331

<i>- Oh, he's right.</i>

19:25.415 --> 19:27.625
<i>- I'm splitting up</i>

19:27.709 --> 19:29.794
<i>You're too much of a distraction</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:48.354
- All right, Hypebeasts.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.357
It's time to announce
our clout king and queen.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.526

19:53.610 --> 19:56.154

19:56.237 --> 19:58.364

19:58.448 --> 20:01.451
<i>Of course I will.</i>
<i>The gang gang's toast.</i>

20:01.534 --> 20:04.370

20:04.454 --> 20:06.372
Tried to what?

20:06.456 --> 20:08.625

- Yo, I'm not doing anything.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.585
<i>- Derica! How could you?</i>
- Dude.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.545
- What is going on?
<i>- Dale? Stop!</i>

20:12.629 --> 20:14.547
- Shit.
- Guys?
<i>- No, I thought we were friends.</i>

20:14.631 --> 20:16.382
<i>- No! No!</i>
- Cerise, no.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.892
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.936
- This year's clout king is...

20:28.019 --> 20:29.479
Holy shit,

20:29.562 --> 20:30.897
it's Benny Choi.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.732

Let's go, Benny!

20:34.442 --> 20:36.778
All right, where is
that little baby pumpkin at?

20:36.861 --> 20:39.155
Yeah, where is Benny? Or Cerise?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.740
Or Derica and Dale?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.742
Oh, this is bad.
This is really, really bad.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.243
- Hey,
yo, yo, yo, Benny!

20:44.327 --> 20:45.870
You will not believe it.

<i>The gang gang called me</i>

What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

21:16.567 --> 21:18.695
Cerise spent all night
trying to help you.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.446
All she wanted
was to be friends,

21:20.530 --> 21:23.032
but you just couldn't let her
in the gang gang, could you?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.367
Truman, let us explain.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.785
Explain this, D.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.329
You didn't approve of Cerise
from the start.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.499
Your whole "inclusivity" brand

21:31.582 --> 21:33.876
- is bullshit. And Dale.
- Oh!

21:33.960 --> 21:36.671
You never told me
that you had a Scouts badge

21:36.754 --> 21:38.715
in betrayal,
you fake-ass friend.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.342
No, it's not for betrayal.
It's for B-trails.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.885
They're the bunny slopes
of hiking.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.138
Dale, shut the fuck up!

21:45.221 --> 21:47.098
Bro, she's trying
to tear us apart.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.350
You got to be kidding me, Benny.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.144
Derica and Dale,
that's one thing,

21:51.227 --> 21:53.104
but I did not expect this shit
from you, bro.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.565
I thought you were my boy.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.775
We were collab partners
for life, but nah.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.485
We still are, bro.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.029
Come on!
You're really gonna believe

22:01.112 --> 22:03.197
a fucking app on your phone
over us?

22:03.281 --> 22:05.825
I'll give you an app.
And a main course.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.494
You're just jealous
'cause I'm out here evolving

22:08.578 --> 22:12.248
- while you're stuck
in basic-ass Latrine land.
- Yeah?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.500
Well, what about you, man?
Your whole life

22:14.584 --> 22:17.336
is one giant
untitled shit project!

22:18.546 --> 22:21.215
<i>- It's no use, babe.</i>

22:21.299 --> 22:23.551
<i>They just hate us</i>
<i>'cause they ain't us.</i>

22:24.594 --> 22:27.346
The only people
trying to break up gang gang

22:27.430 --> 22:30.141
is you three.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.559
Fuck you guys forever.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.728
Let's get out of here, Cerise.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.897
- Truman, no.
- Dude, please.
- Truman, wait.

22:44.864 --> 22:49.077
I've never been this horny
for drama.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.578
I'm sorry, Derica.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.580
A lot of my followers are bots,

22:52.663 --> 22:55.666
so I can't be seen with you.
It's bad for my brand.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.628
- Melody.
- Benny,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.505
I got to say,
that was some fucked-up shit.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.298
You are no longer clout king.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.382
Wait, I won?

23:03.466 --> 23:05.218
- Not anymore.
- So I won?

23:05.301 --> 23:07.011
Nope. I'm the clout king.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.888
Suck it, you basic bitches.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.681
- Let's roll, Salary.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.938
Blessings, Fairfax Middle.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.190
- Cody?
- Cody? Oh, dear God. No.

23:19.273 --> 23:22.902
That's right. I'm back, baby,
and I'm a changed man.

23:22.985 --> 23:26.572
I've officially rebranded
- to @Cody4
- Jesus.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.119
No pranks, all charity.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.789
Sup, Lils. You want to talk?

23:34.872 --> 23:35.915
Oh, my God.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.542
Lily. But I...

23:37.625 --> 23:40.002
I, uh, I need to, uh...

23:40.086 --> 23:41.629
I need to go.

23:42.672 --> 23:46.592
- Worst.
- Night.
- Ever.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.097
Trust me, boo.
They are gonna pay for this.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.474
<i>Babe, look.</i>

23:55.017 --> 23:56.894
<i>Are you thinking</i>
<i>what I'm thinking?</i>

23:58.187 --> 23:59.564
What do you want?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.191
To take down Latrine.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.529
In that case,
have a seat, my liege.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.532
Phyllis! A round of pickles
for the table.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.166
Chirp.
