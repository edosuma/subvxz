WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.796 --> 00:04.089
Is it true we have a son?

00:04.214 --> 00:06.049
I would have told you
when you first awoke.

00:06.257 --> 00:08.134
Katrina withheld
too much from me.

00:08.426 --> 00:11.346
It's hard to
believe in her as I have.

00:12.722 --> 00:13.890
I was trying to please you.

00:18.311 --> 00:20.188
<i>Henry stole the Jincan.</i>
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what he's planning,</i>

00:20.313 --> 00:21.523
<i>but he has to be stopped.</i>

00:21.606 --> 00:23.566
<i>There is</i>
<i>some good inside him.</i>

00:23.650 --> 00:24.651
What are you saying, Crane?

00:24.734 --> 00:25.735
I must fight for my son.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.717
Is it time already?

00:48.925 --> 00:53.138
I have a few hours left
before I report for duty.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.641
Let's use them wisely.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.187
These last few days

01:02.605 --> 01:05.483
have been an unexpected gift.

01:07.193 --> 01:09.195
I don't mean to
sound ungrateful.

01:09.654 --> 01:12.365
I know General Washington
requires you in New York.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.203
This war will end.

01:17.662 --> 01:20.957
A story we tell our
children when we're old.

01:26.463 --> 01:28.506
And what will our
children be like?

01:28.590 --> 01:31.843
Our boys will be
strapping young lads.

01:32.510 --> 01:36.431
And our girls will
be enchantresses.

01:37.724 --> 01:38.767
Like their mother.

02:11.883 --> 02:14.469
I may lack the proper
identification to vote,

02:14.552 --> 02:17.055
but what excuse do our
fellow countrymen have?

02:17.222 --> 02:21.100
A voter turnout rate
of only 40% nationwide.

02:21.726 --> 02:23.228
This is a disgrace.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.438
It's a midterm, Crane.

02:25.522 --> 02:28.483
I fought through lines
of British regulars
for the right to vote,

02:28.566 --> 02:30.860
yet our modern countrymen
can barely form a line.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.071
But, of course,
they're more than passionate

02:33.196 --> 02:35.073
to vote for <i>American Idolatry.</i>

02:35.240 --> 02:36.908
<i>American Idol.</i>
I know its name.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.327
I'm telling you what
it should be called.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.704
So, Colonial America
was a golden age

02:41.830 --> 02:43.915
because everybody
voted in the States?

02:44.791 --> 02:47.043
Oh, wait,
black people couldn't vote.
Neither could women.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.254
So I would have been
turned away at the door,
twice over.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.756
Actually, you don't
own significant
tracts of property,

02:51.840 --> 02:53.383
so thrice over.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.135
Well, maybe I could
afford property if

02:56.261 --> 02:57.846
I weren't paying
all of your bills.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.766
It is true.

03:01.933 --> 03:04.477
Our nation's historical
lack of universal suffrage

03:04.561 --> 03:06.855
is among its
greatest disgraces.

03:07.105 --> 03:09.941
But we have come
a long way since.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.361
It took 180 years and two
constitutional amendments

03:13.444 --> 03:14.737
for me to win this freedom.

03:16.281 --> 03:17.282
Next.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.291
What do you
think you're doing?

03:26.457 --> 03:27.917
I thought I might
observe you vote.

03:28.001 --> 03:29.794
It's illegal for two people
to step into the booth.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.045
Oh.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.214
Well, at least take
my recommendations.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.968
Proposition three,
on zoning laws,
is a travesty.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.094
Shh.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.974
Democracy in action.

03:53.693 --> 03:56.362
This should
help you feel better.

03:56.446 --> 03:57.989
You must at
least try to drink.

03:58.156 --> 03:59.574
This illness is unnatural.

03:59.991 --> 04:01.534
I can feel it.

04:01.701 --> 04:04.913
It's like poison
inside of me.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.084
You think
I did this to you?

04:11.878 --> 04:14.422
I swear this is not my doing.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.675
Sorry to arrive unannounced.
Proceed.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.261
Katrina is not well.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.017
What is the meaning of this?

04:26.142 --> 04:27.268
A house call, if you will.

04:27.352 --> 04:28.978
These men are
here to care for her.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.566
No, unhand me!

04:37.528 --> 04:38.780
Tell me,
what is wrong with her?

04:40.448 --> 04:41.783
I'm sorry, old friend.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.703
I'm here
at Moloch's command.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.216
Everything is as expected.

04:58.925 --> 05:01.386
Now Moloch has
a new purpose for her.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.346
There must be another way.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.598
Time to go.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.226
Stop!

05:09.394 --> 05:12.188
I beg you,
stay this madness.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.565
Let me speak to
Lord Moloch myself.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.734
There is no time.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.486
We are his servants,

05:18.569 --> 05:22.240
and he does not tolerate
disobedience lightly.

05:23.908 --> 05:25.660
No! Abraham, please.

05:25.994 --> 05:27.078
Help me.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.752
Abraham! Abraham!

05:35.712 --> 05:37.255
No!

05:37.380 --> 05:39.465
Abraham!

05:48.683 --> 05:49.684
No!

05:51.310 --> 05:52.353
Abraham!

05:52.437 --> 05:53.938
Katrina!

06:01.446 --> 06:02.530
Get her!

06:02.947 --> 06:04.115
Abraham.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.637
Help!

06:31.267 --> 06:35.063
Miss, you okay? Miss?

06:38.649 --> 06:41.736
"No campaigning
at polling place."
It's absurd.

06:41.861 --> 06:43.863
Thank you.
General Washington
gave each voter

06:43.946 --> 06:45.990
a pint of beer
at the ballot box.

06:48.326 --> 06:49.660
Feel better?

06:49.911 --> 06:51.704
Yes, oddly.

06:56.626 --> 07:01.047
Your exclusion
from Sheriff Reyes'
inner circle must sting.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.800
I can't fault her for wanting
to clean up the town,

07:03.883 --> 07:05.843
even if she doesn't know
what she's really up against.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.805
Morning, Sheriff Reyes.

07:09.305 --> 07:10.348
Officer Mills.

07:12.225 --> 07:13.267
Hey, Mills.

07:14.352 --> 07:17.438
Oh. Got a call on the way here
that sounded up your alley.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.981
State trooper
picked up a Jane Doe,

07:19.107 --> 07:20.525
brought her over to
Westchester General.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.528
A redhead in
full Colonial getup.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.995
Katrina?

07:33.079 --> 07:34.497
Who else could it be?

07:34.622 --> 07:35.832
It was her idea
to stay with the Horseman.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.792
Why would she have left?
She wouldn't.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.294
Unless something had
gone terribly awry.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.719
Katrina.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.972
I need you to step away
from my patient immediately.

07:51.055 --> 07:53.057
She isn't a Jane Doe.
This is my wife.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.476
Her name
is Katrina Crane.

07:56.853 --> 07:58.521
Do you know
what's wrong with her?

07:58.604 --> 08:02.233
She has a fever
of 105 and an infection in
her abdominal wall.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.402
Is there a diagnosis?
Not yet.

08:04.569 --> 08:06.154
Once we get
the culture results back

08:06.237 --> 08:07.864
from the lab,
we'll have a better idea.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.615
Thank you.

08:10.408 --> 08:11.868
Let us know
when you hear.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.622
Katrina.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.667
Hello.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.629
You're safe now, my love,

08:23.921 --> 08:25.631
you hear?

08:26.757 --> 08:27.758
What happened?

08:27.925 --> 08:28.968
It was Henry.

08:29.177 --> 08:31.012
He came with some men,
and they...

08:31.095 --> 08:33.347
And they wanted
to take me away.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.141
I had no choice but to run.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.162
Ichabod,
what's happening to me?

09:34.825 --> 09:37.328
I have tried various
healing incantations,

09:38.079 --> 09:40.206
but this is unlike any
sickness I've ever seen.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.125
Henry expected this illness.

09:44.085 --> 09:47.171
He said that Moloch has
a new purpose for me.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.590
What sort of purpose?

09:50.007 --> 09:52.385
He did not share the details.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.179
He only wanted
to take me away.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.516
All right.
We will find a cure.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.394
Well,
we won't find
one here.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.104
The Horseman is benched
because the sun's out,

10:03.187 --> 10:05.231
but Henry's gonna come
looking for you,
so we got to get going.

10:06.065 --> 10:08.859
Let's get you some medicine,
get you cleaned
up before we go.

10:11.279 --> 10:12.822
Well, the nurses,
they took my clothes.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.449
I don't think we have time
for a shopping spree.

10:17.827 --> 10:21.539
I had no idea fashion changed
so drastically since my era.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.249
Well, that isn't
exactly everyday wear.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.792
Some drunk goth
chick's clothes

10:24.917 --> 10:26.377
ended up in
the lost and found.

10:26.711 --> 10:29.046
Perhaps these garments
should have remained lost.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.715
You don't like them?
No.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.842
Well, yes, they...

10:32.925 --> 10:35.845
Simply a shade form-fitting.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.725
Those men, they came
with Henry to take me.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.520
You two get lost.
I'll trail 'em.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.148
Alone? No,
it's too dangerous.

10:47.231 --> 10:48.774
We need to find out
what's wrong with Katrina.

10:48.858 --> 10:51.235
These guys know.
I'll be fine.

10:51.319 --> 10:53.070
Your mission right now
is to take care of her.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.072
Very well. We shall
rendezvous at the archives.

10:55.698 --> 10:56.699
Be careful.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.783
You, too.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.672
<i>Signaculum deprehensio.</i>

11:13.382 --> 11:15.676
<i>Signaculum deprehensio.</i>

11:20.765 --> 11:22.308
Magic.

11:24.101 --> 11:27.021
Is it not too much
in your present state?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.106
The sickness
ebbs and flows.

11:29.190 --> 11:31.442
The hex will warn us
if Henry's men approach.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.778
Come.

11:37.156 --> 11:40.910
Tell me, what else
do you remember about them?

11:44.705 --> 11:48.000
The doctor had a notebook
with a symbol on it.

11:49.627 --> 11:50.669
<i>A goat</i>

11:51.045 --> 11:53.589
with the Rod of Asclepius
jutting from its head.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.966
Oh, no. No, no.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.476
This?

12:05.851 --> 12:08.062
Did it look like this?

12:08.396 --> 12:09.397
Yes.

12:10.981 --> 12:14.819
This is the symbol
of a bygone
secret organization,

12:15.403 --> 12:17.655
the Hellfire Club.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.782
The British
society of scientists?

12:19.949 --> 12:23.160
They fought for
evil to prevail
in the War for Independence.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.163
Franklin
infiltrated their ranks.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.665
<i>It's how he obtained the key</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:30.501
<i>that allowed Lieutenant Mills</i>
<i>to escape Purgatory.</i>

12:30.835 --> 12:32.086
What would
they want with me?

12:32.211 --> 12:35.631
Franklin
references an experiment.

12:36.841 --> 12:39.510
A woman was infected
with a mysterious illness

12:39.677 --> 12:41.762
with symptoms like yours.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.181
What worries me
is Franklin leaves

12:44.306 --> 12:46.016
no further notes on
the woman's ailment.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.686
Or even whether
she survived.

12:50.396 --> 12:51.564
This is my doing.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.775
I should never have left
you with the Horseman.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.821
Moloch would
have found a way to

12:58.904 --> 13:01.782
bring this sickness
upon me whether
I was under your roof

13:01.866 --> 13:03.284
or Abraham's.

13:05.161 --> 13:08.289
Abraham said he knew nothing
of Moloch's plans either.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.709
I don't understand.

13:13.711 --> 13:16.213
How can a headless
horseman say anything?

13:18.424 --> 13:20.885
An enchantment
on this bauble.

13:21.719 --> 13:25.181
It allows me to see the
human spirit within him.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.766
I converse with him, and...

13:27.975 --> 13:31.187
Converse? I...

13:31.312 --> 13:35.858
And what do you and
Abraham converse about?

13:36.066 --> 13:38.694
Whatever I must.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.739
To gather information
to further our cause.

13:43.491 --> 13:44.783
You think I enjoy it?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.745
No, that's not what I meant.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.290
There are these secrets that
have come between us,

13:52.791 --> 13:57.296
they break my heart
but they do not
reflect our love.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.758
I understand.

14:01.759 --> 14:04.470
But now you wonder what else
I must be keeping from you.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.599
There is nothing.
I swear it.

14:13.312 --> 14:14.605
One day this war will end,

14:15.481 --> 14:18.067
and when it does,
we will build
a life together.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.779
The life we deserve.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.804
Crane,
I've tracked Henry's buddies

14:46.971 --> 14:48.806
to a warehouse
off the Taconic.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.267
I'll call you
when I've got more.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.105
We lost the witch.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.399
I don't know how,
but she got away.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.150
We will continue our search.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.322
I just checked
the translation.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.159
I understand that.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.417
The tablet says, "Within
the setting of one sun."

15:16.500 --> 15:17.751
Yes.

15:18.877 --> 15:19.920
I'm looking at it now.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.298
There is
no other translation.

15:32.016 --> 15:33.851
We will continue
our search.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.686
I'll let you know
if anything develops.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.895
I guess it was nothing.
Let's get back to work.

16:28.656 --> 16:31.200
Do you think
they intended to bring
Katrina to this place?

16:31.617 --> 16:34.203
The pattern of
veins on the cadaver
matched yours exactly.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.796
The doctor's notebook.

16:45.923 --> 16:46.965
"Vessel

16:47.049 --> 16:50.552
"experiencing high fever,
blood pressure

16:50.719 --> 16:52.680
"and increased heart rate.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.057
"Speed of infection
consistent with

16:56.225 --> 16:58.227
"successful inception."

16:58.936 --> 16:59.978
"Inception."

17:00.479 --> 17:02.773
That can't be good.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.776
Keep reading, Ichabod.

17:07.069 --> 17:11.031
"Delivery and
expiration of vessel,
10 to 12 hours."

17:14.410 --> 17:15.744
Katrina,

17:17.121 --> 17:18.539
you're not ill.

17:19.331 --> 17:22.084
I'm pregnant.

17:30.134 --> 17:32.219
I'm pregnant.
I don't understand. How is...

17:32.302 --> 17:35.347
How is this even possible?

17:35.556 --> 17:38.642
You two haven't been alone
together for a while.

17:40.686 --> 17:41.729
Abraham.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.689
Ichabod, I would never...

17:44.982 --> 17:47.151
So if it isn't
his or Crane's...

17:49.069 --> 17:51.697
This thing
growing inside of me
is not born of any man.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.371
How did it happen?

17:59.580 --> 18:00.748
Was it a potion?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.666
A fertility spell?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.209
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:05.794 --> 18:09.214
This section
refers to inception.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.676
"The vessel
will be implanted

18:12.801 --> 18:16.972
"with a birthing seed
of Eastern origin,

18:17.848 --> 18:20.851
"derived from
a substance called Jincan."

18:21.018 --> 18:22.311
As in Jincan venom?

18:24.062 --> 18:26.064
<i>A poison made</i>
<i>from the deadliest creatures.</i>

18:27.524 --> 18:29.067
Henry obtained it from us,

18:30.360 --> 18:31.987
we thought as a weapon.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.364
Jincan is
no ordinary poison.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.243
It's been used for
centuries by dark covens
to grow demons.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.913
Henry is growing
a demon inside of you.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.540
Why?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.668
My hex.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.672
Someone is coming for us.
Take the tunnels. Go.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.911
Go! Find them!

19:48.772 --> 19:51.024
This is where I left Jeremy.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.238
And where he
took his new name.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.453
You sure we'll be safe here?

20:04.454 --> 20:06.415
Churches are
consecrated ground.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.958
You don't
think Henry can
get around that?

20:08.292 --> 20:09.626
The termites did.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.128
This place holds
great meaning to him.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.631
I can only hope he
will not attack us here.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.425
I don't think we can base
our strategy on hope.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.928
Henry's not gonna
stop until he finds you.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.138
He's the one that did this.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.142
Which means he can undo it.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.145
I'm not sure we
understand each other.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.481
Henry is a Sin Eater.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.319
He can remove this demon
growing inside of me.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.071
We must concentrate on facts.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.198
Now, Lieutenant Mills
is right.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.328
Henry possesses great power,
but he uses it for evil.

20:44.494 --> 20:48.540
Yet he continues to struggle
against that side of himself.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.375
He has shown us
nothing but contempt.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.754
Because somewhere
beneath that broken exterior,

20:53.837 --> 20:55.213
he still cares.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.758
He doesn't want us
dead out of apathy.

20:58.050 --> 21:01.637
There is still a part of him
that remains human.

21:02.471 --> 21:05.057
Perhaps if we could reach it,
he could be made whole.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.725
Katrina...

21:06.892 --> 21:08.185
He's trying to kill you.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.896
Moloch is trying to kill me.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.774
Henry follows Moloch

21:14.107 --> 21:17.110
because he had no
family to grab onto,

21:17.194 --> 21:19.196
but now we are here.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.366
We have never lost
faith in each other.

21:22.699 --> 21:26.370
Have you really lost
all faith in our son?

21:30.791 --> 21:31.959
I have not.

21:37.589 --> 21:38.799
Do you hear yourselves?

21:39.925 --> 21:41.259
Henry is
the Horseman of War.

21:41.927 --> 21:47.933
He told us, point blank,
he means to help Moloch
raise hell on Earth.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.434
How does anyone
come back from that?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.186
He is my child.

21:52.396 --> 21:56.274
And I cannot believe
he's a lost cause.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.237
I pray you feel the same.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.574
Do not let your feelings
for him affect our mission.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.244
And I have not.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.371
You're right about Henry.

22:09.746 --> 22:13.667
The odds and the evidence
are stacked against us.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.627
But Katrina is ill.

22:17.587 --> 22:21.591
The doctor's notebook
said the vessel would
expire at sundown.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.760
We're running out of time.

22:28.432 --> 22:33.478
The only option we have
is to beseech Henry.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.897
My mind is made.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.941
Shall we put it to a vote?

22:41.570 --> 22:43.572
I can do the math.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.033
Democracy in action.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.662
I had an urgent call
from your psychiatrist.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.206
Said it was an emergency.
What do you want?

22:56.585 --> 22:58.295
It's not what I want.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.468
Thank you, Captain.

23:12.601 --> 23:15.145
It is time we talked.

23:22.694 --> 23:25.280
I know you're unhappy
with Ichabod's plan.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.909
Crane sees it as a test.
I think he's going to lose.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.834
What is it?

23:38.001 --> 23:39.836
I think that

23:40.921 --> 23:44.049
the demon that's inside of you
is called the "Horrid King."

23:49.346 --> 23:51.139
Katrina!

23:58.563 --> 23:59.815
It's moving.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.117
Quite a trick you pulled,
getting me here.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.161
Is Abigail around the corner?

24:13.453 --> 24:14.746
Are you afraid?

24:15.539 --> 24:18.458
Katrina slipped
through your fingertips.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.210
You must be
feeling vulnerable.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.920
So, you have worked it out.

24:22.212 --> 24:26.550
We know there's a demon
growing inside her.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.887
A demon?

24:31.054 --> 24:35.559
How pedestrian to expend all
that effort on a mere demon.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.188
I don't understand.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.690
Who is the Horrid King?

24:44.025 --> 24:47.154
"And were they known
to men by various names,

24:47.237 --> 24:49.739
"and various idols
through the heathen world.

24:49.865 --> 24:51.741
"Say, Muse,
their names, then known,

24:51.867 --> 24:54.286
"who first, who last..."

24:54.536 --> 24:55.745
You cannot mean...

24:55.871 --> 24:57.080
Would I lie to my own father?

24:57.164 --> 24:58.832
That's impossible.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.418
"Is made with
the blood of human sacrifice
and parents' tears.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.337
"First came the Horrid King,

25:06.047 --> 25:08.884
"Moloch."

25:12.596 --> 25:13.680
No.

25:13.763 --> 25:17.017
Don't say "no." Say "rise."

25:17.475 --> 25:20.604
"Rise, my Horrid King.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.689
"Rise, Moloch."

25:26.276 --> 25:28.361
The demon inside of me...

25:28.570 --> 25:30.447
Is Moloch.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.623
The demon
of the Apocalypse

25:40.290 --> 25:41.958
is growing inside of me.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.461
There must be
something in your arsenal

25:44.544 --> 25:46.129
that can slow this,

25:46.379 --> 25:48.006
at least until
Crane gets back.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.925
My power is
nothing against his.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.635
Then we'll find
a different way to save you.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.306
There is one way
we can stop this.

25:57.307 --> 26:00.018
Moloch cannot rise
if his vessel dies first.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.981
Stop. That's not an option.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.735
When Crane first fell
on that battlefield

26:08.818 --> 26:10.237
all those years ago,

26:10.320 --> 26:13.531
and all of
the voices of Heaven and Hell
were shouting in your ear,

26:13.823 --> 26:16.159
"Let him die,"

26:16.284 --> 26:18.161
you found another
way to save him.

26:21.998 --> 26:25.210
We will find
another way to save you.

26:29.673 --> 26:35.512
"How sharper than
a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child."

26:35.720 --> 26:36.721
King Lear.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.640
Act one, scene four.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.519
Our mutual love of words
is no coincidence.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.523
Perhaps I should thank you
for the twinkle in my eye.

26:47.274 --> 26:49.693
Do you really think I cannot
see through this chicanery?

26:49.985 --> 26:51.528
You live in
Fredericks Manor,

26:51.611 --> 26:54.030
the very place you were
brought into this world.

26:54.114 --> 26:56.032
It is a nexus
of dark magic.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.701
And, coincidentally,

26:57.867 --> 26:59.536
where your mother
first held you,

26:59.703 --> 27:01.830
first taught you
feelings of love.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.000
What did you tell yourself
when you poisoned her?

27:05.625 --> 27:07.544
That you were not
really responsible?

27:07.877 --> 27:10.213
The blood was on
Moloch's hands?

27:10.880 --> 27:14.884
I intended to paint my hands
with both your blood.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.428
Then flick your wrist.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.721
Make it so.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.974
Fate is fickle, Father.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.102
Best not to tempt it.

27:24.477 --> 27:28.189
If you let her die,
it will plague you
for an eternity.

27:28.523 --> 27:30.775
Like the eternity
I spent in that box?

27:30.942 --> 27:33.320
She is not
the reason bad things happen.

27:34.195 --> 27:37.240
Your mother's love
banished her to Purgatory.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.743
Her love for you.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.578
Her decision to save you.

27:41.953 --> 27:44.539
Then read my sin,
see for yourself.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.458
Tell me you're unmoved.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.295
No. You will not touch me.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.758
Because you fear
you will witness

27:54.841 --> 27:56.760
the depth of my suffering.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.889
You are sick
with Moloch's evil,

28:00.972 --> 28:03.099
but you can fight it.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.562
You can spare her...

28:09.022 --> 28:10.148
Jeremy.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.276
You have a choice.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.488
Yes, I do.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.701
And I choose Moloch.

28:23.370 --> 28:27.123
I choose his leadership
and I choose his might.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.794
I choose his fire
that will burn the world.

28:32.253 --> 28:33.463
No matter what you do,

28:34.339 --> 28:36.841
no matter where you hide her,

28:37.008 --> 28:39.344
your wife will die,

28:39.886 --> 28:42.138
and Moloch will be born!

28:47.102 --> 28:48.353
Help!

28:54.818 --> 28:55.985
That was you.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.122
Oh.

29:07.330 --> 29:08.415
You better
sit down for this.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.624
Oh, I know.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.837
Katrina is
bearing Moloch himself.

29:16.423 --> 29:19.968
Henry took
great pride in that.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.269
I'm so sorry.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.021
I tried.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.359
You must know I tried.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.737
If I should pass...

29:40.029 --> 29:41.322
Don't say such things.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.740
If I should pass,

29:42.866 --> 29:44.951
you cannot give up on Henry.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.078
You'll be all he has left.

29:48.163 --> 29:54.669
Evidence of good in him
is not proof
that he will change.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.797
Every day in Purgatory,

29:59.507 --> 30:03.595
I woke up without any proof
I could ever save you.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.764
What kept me going was faith.

30:08.641 --> 30:12.395
I clung onto it
for 231 years.

30:13.271 --> 30:17.025
Had I done so for 230,

30:17.108 --> 30:20.278
we would not be here today.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.947
Remember your
own words, my love.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.618
"We must have faith."

30:40.256 --> 30:42.258
What are
we searching for?

30:42.759 --> 30:45.261
The Hellfire Club
had this stone
tablet in the lab.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.429
I know it has
some significance,

30:46.554 --> 30:47.597
but the photo
didn't turn out right.

30:47.931 --> 30:50.141
This distortion...
This is curious.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.770
This resembles
the aurora borealis.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.104
Northern lights?

30:55.230 --> 30:56.272
Yes.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.192
Franklin.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.444
Benjamin Franklin was
obsessed with the phenomenon.

31:01.945 --> 31:05.114
He theorized the aurora
could banish
demons from Earth.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.202
He wrote a paper.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.496
I must Internet immediately.

31:16.125 --> 31:19.379
Oh, God, it sounds like
a swine being strangled.

31:19.671 --> 31:22.298
Does this not go faster?

31:22.382 --> 31:24.175
You know, dial-up
was a pretty impressive

31:24.259 --> 31:25.760
invention at the time.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.012
And so was the wheel,
I'm sure.

31:29.973 --> 31:30.974
Oh.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.809
"Aurora Borealis.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.310
"Suppositions and conjectures

31:34.435 --> 31:37.480
"towards forming a hypothesis
for its explanation."

31:37.647 --> 31:39.232
By Benjamin Franklin.

31:39.357 --> 31:41.067
Franklin always
wrote in code.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.777
Though his handwriting
is so abysmal,

31:42.902 --> 31:44.988
that could be considered
an encryption on its own.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.155
Actually, it is. Look.

31:47.532 --> 31:50.076
Some of the letters
are written in print,
others in cursive.

31:50.910 --> 31:54.163
The printed letters
spell out a message. Uh...

31:55.790 --> 31:56.916
Right.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.043
"The Hellfire Club

31:59.210 --> 32:01.254
<i>"has acquired a tablet</i>

32:02.505 --> 32:04.841
<i>"bearing instructions on</i>

32:04.924 --> 32:06.634
<i>"the birth of Moloch.</i>

32:07.135 --> 32:10.013
"The only tool with the
power to stop him is

32:10.930 --> 32:13.016
"the aurora borealis.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.018
"Knowing this,

32:15.768 --> 32:20.189
"Franklin built
an aurora prism

32:20.857 --> 32:23.985
<i>"and hid it</i>
<i>inside the tablet.</i>

32:24.152 --> 32:26.904
"If the prism is ever
exposed to sunlight,

32:27.071 --> 32:31.326
"it projects an aurora
banishing Moloch
before he is born."

32:31.451 --> 32:33.411
If we get that tablet
and find the prism...

32:33.494 --> 32:37.457
And shine sunlight
through it onto Katrina,
we can save her life.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.209
But the lab is heavily
guarded and that was
before I broke in.

32:40.501 --> 32:42.754
It's the one thing
I miss about modernity,

32:42.837 --> 32:44.547
an army to assist me.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.425
An army...

32:47.508 --> 32:50.637
I know where we
can get one of those.

32:51.512 --> 32:53.556
Katrina. Katrina.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.768
We've found
a way to stop Moloch.

32:57.060 --> 33:00.271
But I must leave you
for a very short while.

33:02.565 --> 33:05.193
This device is
called a "radio."

33:05.526 --> 33:07.654
Push this button and speak

33:08.196 --> 33:10.490
and wherever I am,
I will respond.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.535
Like magic.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.799
Mills, I told you
to keep your walking

33:27.924 --> 33:29.634
historical society
out of my precinct.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.594
There is something
we need to tell you.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.304
What's that?

33:33.471 --> 33:35.765
The truth about what's
going on in Sleepy Hollow.

33:41.604 --> 33:44.232
A doomsday cult?

33:44.899 --> 33:46.109
That's right.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.319
In a warehouse out
on Spangler Road?

33:48.945 --> 33:52.115
The Manson Family out
in sunny California
sounded crazy once, too.

33:56.411 --> 33:57.620
That body showed
signs of torture.

33:58.663 --> 33:59.997
Couldn't have been more
than a few weeks old.

34:04.335 --> 34:06.587
What's he doing here?

34:07.380 --> 34:09.674
The club has Colonial origin.
I went to Crane earlier on.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.926
It was his research that
cracked the case wide open.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.052
The Hellfire Club,

34:13.136 --> 34:15.555
founded in 1718 by
the Duke of Wharton,

34:15.638 --> 34:18.224
has a long history of
horrific experimentation

34:18.349 --> 34:19.976
on human subjects.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.895
It's lunacy, of course.

34:22.979 --> 34:24.647
But their possession
of illegal arms

34:24.814 --> 34:26.983
and their horrific
experiments are very real.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.652
We need a tactical team.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.238
If we jump on this,
we can bring them in.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.950
In the short time
that I've been here,

34:36.033 --> 34:38.369
you haven't given me much
reason to trust you, Mills.

34:39.412 --> 34:42.123
You said you wanted to
clean up Sleepy Hollow,

34:42.206 --> 34:45.334
return it to the peaceful
town you used to know.

34:45.501 --> 34:49.589
Well, here's your chance
in a very big way.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.347
Sheriff! Search warrant!

35:18.075 --> 35:19.869
Shots fired.
Officer needs help.

35:21.204 --> 35:23.164
The tablet's in here.

35:24.457 --> 35:25.958
There. That case.

35:26.501 --> 35:27.543
Think you can crack it?

35:28.753 --> 35:30.546
It's a three-digit passcode.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.257
A cult such as this would use
a number of significance.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.009
I can decipher it.
Come on, Crane.

35:35.343 --> 35:36.427
Just give me a moment.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.056
We don't have a moment.

35:42.391 --> 35:45.895
589 Wharton Street,
address of
the London clubhouse.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.984
1718, the year
the club was founded.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.699
They're a freaking
evil club, try 666.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.124
What a lack of imagination.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.105
Let's go.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.692
Mills.

36:42.285 --> 36:45.079
I can see why Corbin always
spoke so highly of you.

36:46.497 --> 36:47.790
Thank you.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.835
But I was only
half the team.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.338
What did you
say you did again?

36:56.173 --> 36:57.550
I'm a criminal profiler,

36:57.800 --> 37:00.803
with an emphasis on acts
of historical imitation.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.556
Let's be in touch.

37:18.446 --> 37:20.615
<i>Ichabod, please hurry.</i>

37:21.782 --> 37:23.367
Katrina?

37:23.451 --> 37:24.702
Katrina, we're coming back.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.415
It's coming now!

37:34.378 --> 37:37.048
Katrina! Katrina,
can you hear me?

37:54.774 --> 37:56.859
We end this now!
Stay with me, Katrina.

37:57.526 --> 37:58.527
Stay with me.
We're almost there.

38:16.545 --> 38:17.880
Hold on, Katrina!

38:58.337 --> 38:59.588
Oh, my God!

39:30.661 --> 39:31.704
She isn't breathing.

39:34.582 --> 39:36.500
Katrina, please!
Please don't...

39:37.043 --> 39:38.502
Please don't leave me.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.963
Oh, God...

39:41.964 --> 39:43.215
Breathe!

39:46.010 --> 39:47.970
Please, Katrina! Don't you...

39:48.054 --> 39:49.055
Don't...

40:01.567 --> 40:04.028
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.

40:10.201 --> 40:12.703
We did it.

40:15.039 --> 40:16.624
I thought we'd lost you.

40:17.917 --> 40:18.959
You're here.

40:20.169 --> 40:22.338
Where I belong.

40:28.969 --> 40:32.848
Whereas I belong
somewhere else.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.778
She's fallen asleep.

40:50.950 --> 40:57.790
Holding her just now
is a joy I've
not felt in an age.

41:00.668 --> 41:02.002
And yet...

41:03.212 --> 41:04.922
Today was a bit
close for comfort?

41:06.549 --> 41:07.508
I agree.

41:07.591 --> 41:10.010
Moloch nearly
rose to our world.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.888
You're wondering how long
we can keep up this dance.

41:13.013 --> 41:16.183
How long before Abraham
comes looking for Katrina?

41:16.725 --> 41:19.854
He will stop at
nothing to get her back.

41:20.146 --> 41:22.648
Well, at least we got clarity.

41:23.065 --> 41:27.069
We know where Henry stands.

41:29.113 --> 41:31.365
You can't possibly still
think you can reach him.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.159
When I touched
Henry today,

41:33.284 --> 41:35.411
somehow...

41:35.953 --> 41:37.913
I saw him.

41:38.622 --> 41:41.333
<i>Experienced a memory he did</i>
<i>not mean for me to see.</i>

41:41.417 --> 41:42.585
Help!

41:44.170 --> 41:47.673
A lost boy,
alone in the woods,
crying for help.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.219
I know it's hard to see,

41:53.721 --> 41:57.433
but I believe, inside,
he is still that small boy.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.642
Henry would love for
you to believe that.

41:58.767 --> 41:59.852
No.

42:00.477 --> 42:01.979
I do not think he would.

42:05.274 --> 42:08.527
But it is
a question of faith.

42:12.031 --> 42:13.824
We stopped Moloch.

42:14.742 --> 42:15.743
Today was a win.
