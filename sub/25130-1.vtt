00:48.677 --> 00:51.818
Not far from here, there's
a place called the Vale.

00:53.061 --> 00:56.890
About 100 years ago, a
young lady called Lucy

00:56.892 --> 00:58.583
was getting ready
for her wedding,

00:59.929 --> 01:01.828
so full of joy and excitement

01:03.174 --> 01:05.519
that her lover Phillip
had proposed to her.

01:05.521 --> 01:08.179
She invited all her family
and guests to the wedding.

01:10.147 --> 01:14.494
The day came and Lucy
waited at the church

01:14.496 --> 01:17.188
and waited, nobody came.

01:19.190 --> 01:22.711
Finally, in fury Lucy went
into the woods and took an ax

01:24.161 --> 01:26.646
and made her way to Phillip's
home in the dead of the night.

01:28.130 --> 01:32.203
Lucy could hear Phillip
upstairs with someone else.

01:33.998 --> 01:36.792
She slowly pushed
the bedroom door open

01:36.794 --> 01:40.798
to find her lover on the
bed and laughing about Lucy.

01:42.558 --> 01:46.217
She stood there shocked, as
a tear rolled down her cheek.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.082
She lifted the ax and
violently butchered

01:51.084 --> 01:52.566
both of them on the bed.

01:52.568 --> 01:55.502
The screams could be heard
throughout the woods that night.

01:56.986 --> 02:00.264
Later, Lucy came out of the
house as though in a trance

02:00.266 --> 02:02.058
with the bloody ax
and her wedding dress

02:02.060 --> 02:03.165
now covered in blood.

02:04.615 --> 02:07.409
She slowly made her way
to the bridge with a rope.

02:07.411 --> 02:11.413
Heartbroken from what she
had done, she put the noose

02:11.415 --> 02:13.865
around her neck and hung
herself from the bridge.

02:15.039 --> 02:17.246
To this day, in
the dead of night,

02:17.248 --> 02:21.492
people still see the
spirit of Lady Lucy.

02:21.494 --> 02:23.114
She's crying black tears

02:23.116 --> 02:25.429
in search of Phillip,
the man she loved.

03:00.981 --> 03:01.808
Hey!

03:01.810 --> 03:03.361
Hey.

03:10.198 --> 03:12.924
Shall I go and
get some tokens?

03:34.463 --> 03:35.324
Did you want some more?

03:35.326 --> 03:36.256
Yes please.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.257
That's five pounds please.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.192
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:54.587 --> 03:56.552
Ladies, gentlemen,
girls and boys

03:56.554 --> 04:00.972
come one and all, ride the
ghost train, if you dare.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.181
Do you wanna go on?

04:05.183 --> 04:07.114
Yeah, can do.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.946
Welcome.

04:15.263 --> 04:16.089
Be careful.

04:16.091 --> 04:17.023
Have fun.

04:29.794 --> 04:30.623
Ah.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.178
I don't wanna go in.

05:13.769 --> 05:15.044
I'm gonna
get this one all.

05:15.046 --> 05:17.564
Oh, oh yeah!

05:17.566 --> 05:18.807
Love it, don't ya.

05:18.809 --> 05:22.433
They'll be good as soon
as they pass the pole.

05:36.344 --> 05:37.206
Lee.

05:40.693 --> 05:41.521
Lee!

05:46.940 --> 05:48.528
Fairground again?

05:56.087 --> 05:58.262
I can't just
forget about it, Tom.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.439
He's my brother.

06:13.035 --> 06:15.003
How do you feel about

06:16.936 --> 06:18.489
us getting our own place like,

06:19.939 --> 06:22.318
in a, in a couple of months.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.528
You wanna move in together?

06:24.530 --> 06:25.462
Do I stutter?

06:27.360 --> 06:29.395
Yes, I do.

06:29.397 --> 06:32.259
Yeah, absolutely I think
as soon as your mum gets

06:32.261 --> 06:34.814
everything sorted we
should definitely do that.

06:34.816 --> 06:37.922
Tom, can we just not talk
about my family problems?

06:39.855 --> 06:42.720
I just want to forget about
it this weekend, okay?

06:44.791 --> 06:45.790
Things will be okay.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.689
And how do you know that?

06:47.691 --> 06:49.138
Well, because you've got me

06:49.140 --> 06:51.039
and I'll not let anything
happen to hurt you.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.246
Your dad's going
away for a long time

06:53.248 --> 06:54.629
for what he did to your mum.

06:56.389 --> 06:57.837
Babe, I'm really sorry.

06:57.839 --> 07:00.080
I, I know that things are really
hard for you at the moment.

07:00.082 --> 07:02.117
I can't even begin to imagine

07:02.119 --> 07:03.532
what you must be going through.

07:03.534 --> 07:05.053
But I love you.

07:06.434 --> 07:08.434
Promise, I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

07:08.436 --> 07:09.644
trying to make you happy.

07:14.994 --> 07:17.237
Hey, I've got a joke for you.

07:18.515 --> 07:19.997
Go on.

07:19.999 --> 07:23.451
How can you tell if a
blonde has her own vibrator?

07:26.592 --> 07:28.177
Don't know.

07:28.179 --> 07:30.421
She got the
chips on her tooth.

07:30.423 --> 07:31.664
Oh my god.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.599
Well, I didn't say it
was a good joke, did I?

07:34.496 --> 07:36.151
But I'm a brunette.

07:36.153 --> 07:38.224
Made you laugh, though,
didn't it, dumbass?

07:41.883 --> 07:44.124
So yeah, in a few months,

07:44.126 --> 07:46.264
we'll get our own place
together, then, yeah?

07:46.266 --> 07:50.199
Yeah, I mean, we could
always rent somewhere, I just,

07:50.201 --> 07:53.170
we need to get
out of that town, Tom.

07:54.136 --> 07:56.309
There is nothing there for us.

07:56.311 --> 07:58.278
No, you're right, there isn't.

08:01.212 --> 08:03.350
Do you know what?

08:03.352 --> 08:07.078
In the morning, I want
you to make me breakfast.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.045
Ah.

08:08.047 --> 08:12.670
I want, eggs, bacon,

08:12.672 --> 08:17.572
two sausages, beans,
I want the lot.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.228
We'll see.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.678
You are making me a
breakfast in the morning.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.544
Is that so?

08:24.373 --> 08:25.961
I'll make you anything you want.

08:26.824 --> 08:27.653
Good.

08:41.529 --> 08:43.669
Oh, it's freezing.

08:46.637 --> 08:48.294
- Well this is lovely.
- Yeah.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.882
Where'd you find this?

08:51.884 --> 08:54.678
Uh, got it for the whole
weekend, I know some people.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.886
Have we?

08:55.888 --> 08:58.474
Yeah, at least the
weather held out for us.

08:58.476 --> 09:00.269
Brilliant, yeah.

09:00.271 --> 09:01.823
Followed
the wrong crowd.

09:01.825 --> 09:03.065
Yeah.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.273
I can't believe this
is ours for the weekend.

09:04.275 --> 09:05.896
Yeah.

09:05.898 --> 09:06.726
Brill.

09:19.808 --> 09:20.637
Hm.

09:31.993 --> 09:32.821
Ahh.

09:34.547 --> 09:37.617
Dead flowers, it's okay.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.310
No seriously I, I just
bought them two hours ago,

09:41.312 --> 09:43.381
how could they have
died so quickly?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.797
Oh don't
worry about it.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.833
- No, no, seriously...
- You can get me some more.

09:46.835 --> 09:48.285
They shouldn't be dead now.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.010
It's okay.

09:51.012 --> 09:52.252
No, no, no, no, seriously I,

09:52.254 --> 09:54.427
I just bought them
like two hours ago,

09:54.429 --> 09:56.636
- they shouldn't...
- Oh, don't worry about it.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.500
You can get me some more.

09:58.502 --> 10:01.160
Yeah but how can they be dead?

10:05.198 --> 10:07.684
I think I just saw
something go past the window.

10:15.277 --> 10:17.001
Well it's just your
imagination babe,

10:17.003 --> 10:18.108
there's nothing there.

10:23.527 --> 10:24.977
Cheap bloody flowers.

10:39.957 --> 10:42.822
Hey babe, it stopped
raining, sun's even out.

10:45.756 --> 10:47.102
Make us a coffee, would ya?

10:49.139 --> 10:50.934
What, did your
last slave die off?

10:54.006 --> 10:56.318
Yes you are, do as
you're told, lady.

12:21.265 --> 12:22.266
Thank you.

12:27.099 --> 12:28.031
Here we go.

12:55.403 --> 12:58.197
You know what, that
was so stupid, Tom.

12:58.199 --> 13:01.407
Look, I said I
was sorry, okay?

13:01.409 --> 13:05.549
It was so stupid, you
said we were gonna have fun.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.724
Punching guys in pubs
isn't fun, not at all.

13:08.726 --> 13:10.899
He chugged a drink
over you because you said

13:10.901 --> 13:12.383
you wouldn't dance with him.

13:12.385 --> 13:15.524
So, it's a dress,
it will wash.

13:15.526 --> 13:18.838
Look, some guys just don't
take no for an answer, okay.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.460
How'd you think it
made me feel to see him

13:20.462 --> 13:23.636
stood there with his
hands all over you?

13:23.638 --> 13:25.467
We're still talking
about this guy.

13:26.641 --> 13:29.987
Oh my god, you brought
me here to forget about

13:29.989 --> 13:32.820
all the crap that's
happening in my life.

13:34.028 --> 13:36.752
Just forget about it, grow up.

13:36.754 --> 13:38.306
Look, I'm trying, all right.

13:38.308 --> 13:42.344
I am trying so hard to show
my girlfriend a good time.

13:42.346 --> 13:44.864
Well why don't you
just leave it then?

13:44.866 --> 13:46.419
Look at your eye, for god sake.

14:06.301 --> 14:07.130
Hey.

14:09.270 --> 14:10.098
Here.

14:11.686 --> 14:15.069
Come here, let me clean you up.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.457
I am sorry.

14:26.494 --> 14:29.738
I know you was only
sticking up for me and,

14:31.430 --> 14:33.225
and them guys punched
you first but,

14:35.917 --> 14:37.815
still fall out
with you a little.

15:13.472 --> 15:14.300
Tom.

15:18.995 --> 15:20.375
I do love you, you know.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.620
Please don't ever leave me.

15:26.105 --> 15:26.934
Never.

15:51.510 --> 15:52.304
Babe?

15:56.860 --> 15:57.688
Leah?

15:59.967 --> 16:00.795
Leah?

16:10.149 --> 16:11.495
My mom's in hospital.

16:13.394 --> 16:14.222
We need to go.

16:15.430 --> 16:16.705
Your dad again.

16:16.707 --> 16:17.950
I don't know.

16:20.470 --> 16:22.161
I'm sorry Tom,
but we need to go.

16:23.231 --> 16:24.817
Yeah.

16:24.819 --> 16:26.752
- Yeah of course, yeah.
- We need to go.

16:36.624 --> 16:38.417
According to my GPS,
the quickest way back

16:38.419 --> 16:40.317
is through this place
called the Vale.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.009
I swear to fucking god if
he tries to come near you

16:44.011 --> 16:46.496
or your mama, I'm
gonna fucking kill him.

16:48.774 --> 16:53.710
Just stop Tom, I don't
want to talk about it, okay.

16:56.851 --> 16:59.267
My mom's in a really bad way.

17:04.169 --> 17:05.064
- Tom, look out!
- Oh!

18:11.753 --> 18:12.582
Leah.

18:15.585 --> 18:17.032
Oh shit, breathe, Leah.

18:17.034 --> 18:19.034
Leah, it's okay, it's all
right, it's gonna be all right.

18:19.036 --> 18:20.693
Just, just try
and breathe, okay.

18:21.832 --> 18:23.901
Just keep calm, jeez,
where's your pump?

18:23.903 --> 18:24.764
You inhaler, where is it?

18:24.766 --> 18:26.423
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry.

18:27.838 --> 18:29.426
I know I packed it, where is it?

18:34.259 --> 18:35.534
Jesus, where is it?

18:35.536 --> 18:36.811
It's all right baby,
just breathe, okay,

18:36.813 --> 18:38.847
just breathe, I'm
gonna get it too.

18:38.849 --> 18:40.055
Where'd I put it,
where'd I put I?

18:40.057 --> 18:42.094
I know I packed
it, come on, Jesus!

18:43.475 --> 18:48.305
Here, here, it's all right,
here we go, here we go.

18:48.307 --> 18:51.688
Steady and slow, it's all
right, it's all right, baby.

18:51.690 --> 18:52.898
It's all right.

19:00.871 --> 19:02.045
Keep it goin'.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.186
It's all right.

19:07.844 --> 19:11.294
I'm gonna try and get
the car started, okay?

19:16.542 --> 19:17.923
What's the matter?

19:19.338 --> 19:21.890
Need to find something
to charge the car back up.

19:21.892 --> 19:23.202
Tom, I need to get home!

19:23.204 --> 19:24.619
I know, babe, but there's,

19:25.827 --> 19:27.102
it's not responding
at all, I don't know

19:27.104 --> 19:27.931
- what's wrong with it.
- I need,

19:27.933 --> 19:29.381
I need to go to my mom.

19:29.383 --> 19:30.761
I need to find something
to charge it up first,

19:30.763 --> 19:33.145
then I'll get you back
straight away, I promise, okay.

19:34.284 --> 19:35.941
It's gonna be all right.

19:38.461 --> 19:40.668
Well what, what about,
what about over there?

19:40.670 --> 19:44.637
Yeah, that's
probably the best bet.

19:44.639 --> 19:46.469
All right, I'll go
and grab my stuff.

19:56.306 --> 19:57.169
Come here.

21:44.828 --> 21:46.002
It's so old.

21:48.625 --> 21:50.869
Tom, I think we should
get out of this place.

21:55.356 --> 21:59.151
Well, I need to find something
to power the car up first.

23:01.698 --> 23:02.527
Hello?

23:06.393 --> 23:08.013
Hello?

23:38.873 --> 23:41.393
Under the table, go, go, go.

23:48.573 --> 23:49.675
Can you hear that?

23:49.677 --> 23:50.506
Yeah.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.507
Is that the
floorboards creaking?

23:53.509 --> 23:55.819
Yeah, there's someone in here.

23:55.821 --> 23:57.303
Oh!

23:57.305 --> 23:59.305
It's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.243
Tom come
on, Tom come on.

25:21.528 --> 25:22.390
Leah?

25:26.153 --> 25:26.981
Leah!

25:37.095 --> 25:37.923
Leah!

26:16.272 --> 26:17.100
Tom!

26:21.829 --> 26:22.658
Tom!

26:31.874 --> 26:32.944
Leah.

26:34.048 --> 26:34.877
Leah.

26:37.673 --> 26:40.296
Lee, what are you doin' here?

26:44.334 --> 26:45.335
You're dead.

26:50.375 --> 26:51.859
You can't be here.

30:05.156 --> 30:06.329
Who the hell are you?

30:07.158 --> 30:08.088
Me?

30:08.090 --> 30:09.641
Wh-what are you doin' here?

30:09.643 --> 30:11.263
Where is here?

30:11.265 --> 30:12.197
This is the Vale.

30:13.060 --> 30:13.887
What?

30:13.889 --> 30:14.751
The Vale!

30:15.856 --> 30:17.097
All right, listen,
listen, can you help me?

30:17.099 --> 30:18.270
I'm trying to find
my girlfriend...

30:18.272 --> 30:19.513
- No!
- She's lost here somewhere.

30:19.515 --> 30:22.033
It's haunted,
it's haunted, man.

30:22.035 --> 30:22.861
Haunted?

30:22.863 --> 30:23.724
Haunted!

30:23.726 --> 30:25.174
What are you on about?

30:25.176 --> 30:27.141
You've not seen the
things I've seen, have ya?

30:27.143 --> 30:28.694
- It's haunted.
- Things?

30:28.696 --> 30:30.558
How'd, come on, how do you
know it's not just some,

30:30.560 --> 30:32.733
some crazy nutter comin'
around dressed up,

30:32.735 --> 30:33.736
havin' a bit of fun?

30:35.186 --> 30:38.361
Crazy people don't float
through walls, do they?

30:44.367 --> 30:45.575
Where is Leah?

30:47.025 --> 30:51.545
Listen, listen, you tell
me the entrance to the Vale,

30:51.547 --> 30:55.135
and I'll tell you where your
girlfriend is, I'll tell ya.

30:55.137 --> 30:56.999
Well how do I know
I can trust you?

30:57.001 --> 31:00.140
You've got no choice, I've
been stuck here for years.

31:00.142 --> 31:02.625
If you don't work with me,
if we don't work together,

31:02.627 --> 31:04.594
you're gonna be stuck
here the same as me.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.388
Do you wanna end
up looking like me?

31:07.390 --> 31:08.529
No, didn't think so.

31:12.016 --> 31:17.021
All right, the entrance
it's, it's down that way.

31:17.884 --> 31:18.988
Oh yeah, great, thanks for that!

31:24.891 --> 31:29.896
Look, how do you know, how
do you know she's even here?

31:31.104 --> 31:32.551
How do you know you're
not seeing things, eh?

31:32.553 --> 31:34.657
When was the last
time you had a drink?

31:34.659 --> 31:36.521
When was the last
time you ate anything?

31:36.523 --> 31:38.557
You could be going off your
end just as much as I am,

31:38.559 --> 31:41.079
or you think I am, hey, here.

31:48.466 --> 31:49.499
Thanks.

31:49.501 --> 31:50.330
Right.

31:52.056 --> 31:55.229
Things to remember, you need
to stay away from the mist.

31:55.231 --> 31:56.713
- Okay.
- The mist.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.337
I know it sounds cooky,
sounds crazy, but you've gotta

31:59.339 --> 32:01.408
listen, you need to
stay away from the mist.

32:01.410 --> 32:04.135
- All right, I'll stay away.
- When you go past the grave,

32:04.137 --> 32:05.826
the sand that's in
the bag, you need to

32:05.828 --> 32:07.862
throw that onto the grave.

32:07.864 --> 32:09.623
- All right.
- Yeah, sounds crazy, I know.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.832
You think I'm mad,
I know you do.

32:11.834 --> 32:14.941
But you've gotta listen,
you must listen, please.

32:16.425 --> 32:19.046
All right, if you know so
much, why is she even after me?

32:19.048 --> 32:21.324
'Cause she thinks you're
Phillip like she does me.

32:21.326 --> 32:22.983
She thinks you're
her ex-husband.

32:24.226 --> 32:26.122
I know, I know, I
know, it sounds insane.

32:26.124 --> 32:27.572
It really does sound insane.

32:27.574 --> 32:29.470
And I, I'm, to be
honest with you,

32:29.472 --> 32:31.714
I'm not sure I'm not
going out me mind meself.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.235
I've been stuck here that long.

32:34.615 --> 32:39.032
But, you know, that's it,
there's nothing else we can do.

32:39.034 --> 32:41.726
So, good luck, I'm off.

32:45.247 --> 32:48.144
One other thing,
hide in the cellar.

32:48.146 --> 32:51.011
You must remember
that, all right.

33:40.267 --> 33:41.096
Leah.

33:50.174 --> 33:51.037
Leah.

33:51.899 --> 33:52.659
Leah!

33:56.214 --> 33:57.043
Leah!

34:00.736 --> 34:04.945
Come on baby, speak
to me, where are you?

34:04.947 --> 34:05.775
Leah!

35:53.089 --> 35:53.918
Leah.

35:55.644 --> 35:57.784
Leah, I'm not gonna
give up, Leah.

35:58.819 --> 36:00.166
Leah, Leah baby.

36:03.099 --> 36:03.928
Baby, what is it?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.723
What's wrong?

36:07.725 --> 36:09.658
I think I'm...

36:10.693 --> 36:13.351
Baby what is it, what's wrong?

36:15.181 --> 36:17.008
I think I'm dying, Tom.

36:17.010 --> 36:21.566
What, no, no, no, no, no,
you can't be, you can't be.

36:23.706 --> 36:27.676
The lady with, with the
white face gave me a drink.

36:29.436 --> 36:30.541
Who is she, Tom?

36:32.819 --> 36:35.026
Baby, baby, you're
gonna be fine,

36:35.028 --> 36:37.028
you're gonna be fine, okay.

36:37.030 --> 36:38.892
They can't hurt you,
they're not even real.

36:38.894 --> 36:40.859
Ghosts can't, they
can't hurt you.

36:44.140 --> 36:44.969
Babe.

36:48.628 --> 36:50.285
God help her, please.

39:12.047 --> 39:15.393
We need
to get home, Tom.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.812
I've been looking
for years, okay.

39:21.781 --> 39:24.851
I'll find the ingredients I
need to make this red sand

39:24.853 --> 39:27.131
that'll stop her from
following us home.

39:28.201 --> 39:29.616
I'm trying my best.

39:31.238 --> 39:35.344
Just, this place is
bigger than I thought.

39:35.346 --> 39:38.036
I need you to
take me home, now.

39:38.038 --> 39:40.178
Just keep your voice down.

39:43.492 --> 39:46.666
You know what, you go out there,

39:46.668 --> 39:48.566
you try and find us a way home.

39:49.912 --> 39:53.951
While there's some crazy
ass ghost stalking you.

39:59.646 --> 40:04.408
I think we died, Tom.

40:04.410 --> 40:06.377
I think we died
in the car crash.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.933
Look at ya, your hair's
not really changed.

40:13.177 --> 40:14.937
You haven't really
changed one bit.

40:17.906 --> 40:20.426
We didn't die, Leah.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.981
Well why can't we leave
this place then, eh?

40:25.983 --> 40:29.156
Why can't we just get
in the car and go?

40:29.158 --> 40:32.712
Because there's a
ghost that stalks us

40:32.714 --> 40:35.613
every time I try
and leave the house.

40:37.166 --> 40:40.169
How many times do I have to
go through this with you?

40:44.242 --> 40:46.450
What does it want from us?

40:46.452 --> 40:48.177
How the
hell should I know?

40:53.217 --> 40:54.977
Have you tried
the mobiles again?

40:57.117 --> 41:00.567
This is Britain,
you can't get lost,

41:00.569 --> 41:04.159
we can't, we can't get trapped
in the middle of nowhere.

41:12.685 --> 41:14.719
I'm sorry, Leah.

41:43.819 --> 41:46.822
Leah died in the house,
I buried her outside.

41:47.927 --> 41:49.618
I'm losing my sanity.

42:05.945 --> 42:08.119
It is growing Leah, it is.

42:11.364 --> 42:12.572
We're not dead.

42:14.712 --> 42:16.058
We are not dead.

43:06.592 --> 43:10.041
I saw the Lady Lucy floating
through the mills again today.

43:10.043 --> 43:11.525
She seems to be
carrying the dolls

43:11.527 --> 43:13.735
from over at the
house to the mills.

43:13.737 --> 43:15.012
Where she collected
them as a child,

43:15.014 --> 43:17.533
but her parents were
killed in the fire.

43:18.983 --> 43:21.745
She seems to be repeating what
she did in her physical life.

43:22.918 --> 43:24.918
The red sand seems
to work once again,

43:24.920 --> 43:26.646
as it keeps her at bay.

43:27.958 --> 43:29.820
I placed sand all
around this house again

43:29.822 --> 43:32.685
as it started to blow away
with the strong winds.

43:32.687 --> 43:35.860
I need to keep doing this to
stop her from getting to me.

43:35.862 --> 43:40.177
I don't know what she is, but
this spirit isn't a happy one.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.109
In my 20 years of searching,

43:43.111 --> 43:46.008
I've never seen
anything like this.

43:46.010 --> 43:48.804
But still, time is
running out for me.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.733
Who were they then, eh?

45:28.872 --> 45:30.354
Oh go on, tell me,
'cause I can't stand

45:30.356 --> 45:32.321
seeing you hanging around
with pricks like that.

45:32.323 --> 45:35.980
They were friends Tom,
that's all, just friends.

45:35.982 --> 45:38.224
Why would you just start
fighting with them like that?

45:38.226 --> 45:40.882
Hello, didn't you
hear what he said to me?

45:40.884 --> 45:41.747
Fucking cow.

45:42.748 --> 45:43.610
You are.

45:45.302 --> 45:47.751
How dare you say that to me.

45:47.753 --> 45:52.238
I would never do
that to you, never.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.068
Do you know what?

45:57.279 --> 45:58.556
I can't do this anymore.

46:03.941 --> 46:05.218
I need some time apart.

46:07.427 --> 46:08.843
I can't, I can't do this.

46:40.978 --> 46:44.292
Look, I don't want
to lose you, okay.

46:46.156 --> 46:49.709
I don't want to
live without you.

46:49.711 --> 46:53.197
You need to trust me, I
would never, never hurt you.

46:54.958 --> 46:55.821
Yeah?

46:58.547 --> 47:00.824
You know that, don't you?

47:00.826 --> 47:01.688
Yeah.

48:17.557 --> 48:19.214
Come on Tom, get up.

48:23.701 --> 48:25.218
Get up!

49:56.587 --> 49:57.416
Leah?

50:00.384 --> 50:01.213
Leah!

50:03.525 --> 50:04.354
Leah!

50:08.013 --> 50:08.841
Leah!

50:16.676 --> 50:17.505
Leah!

50:22.372 --> 50:23.200
Leah!

50:25.133 --> 50:25.996
Leah!

50:27.825 --> 50:29.411
Leah!

57:34.148 --> 57:36.599
Three long years I've been
trapped in this house.

57:37.703 --> 57:39.809
My food supply started
to run very low.

57:40.913 --> 57:42.188
I wouldn't have lasted this long

57:42.190 --> 57:44.915
if the cellar hadn't
been full of food.

57:44.917 --> 57:47.746
She knows I'm here,
whatever she is.

57:47.748 --> 57:50.024
Strange noises
haunt me at night.

57:50.026 --> 57:51.577
I like being in the cellar,

57:51.579 --> 57:53.959
because I can't hear
the noises she makes.

57:53.961 --> 57:56.479
I need to find the
entrance to the Vale.

57:56.481 --> 57:57.963
That is the only way out.

57:57.965 --> 58:00.036
But I only have four
hours to find it.

58:01.209 --> 58:04.038
I figured it out, that
the only time she rests

58:04.040 --> 58:06.937
is from 1:00 p.m. 'til
5:00 p.m., daytime.

58:06.939 --> 58:09.043
After that, she
comes looking for me.

58:09.045 --> 58:11.321
I'm writing these
diaries in the cellar.

58:11.323 --> 58:15.152
It's 12:30, she comes
out looking for me,

58:15.154 --> 58:17.983
trying to figure out
a way into the house.

58:17.985 --> 58:19.950
The spell I use does work.

58:19.952 --> 58:21.814
Around the house, the
circle of red sand

58:21.816 --> 58:24.092
to keep her from getting to me.

58:24.094 --> 58:26.370
The front door
opened the other day,

58:26.372 --> 58:29.099
and she stood there looking
at me with soulless eyes.

58:30.515 --> 58:33.999
I held a cross up to her, but
it just exploded in my hand.

58:34.001 --> 58:37.142
She wants me for something,
but I don't know what.

58:44.529 --> 58:47.599
Where are you going, Tom?

58:47.601 --> 58:49.980
Just leave me alone all
right, you're not real.

58:49.982 --> 58:52.535
Charming, your
girlfriend isn't real.

58:52.537 --> 58:53.881
What, do you not remember?

58:53.883 --> 58:55.330
What?

58:55.332 --> 58:56.195
You died!

58:57.611 --> 59:00.681
I couldn't save you,
I had to bury you.

59:00.683 --> 59:01.613
- Want me to show you?
- No.

59:01.615 --> 59:02.475
Do you want some proof, hey?

59:02.477 --> 59:03.269
- Tom!
- Come on, let,

59:03.271 --> 59:04.374
let's have a look.

59:04.376 --> 59:05.548
- Let go!
- Let's have a look.

59:05.550 --> 59:08.240
- Right here, right here!
- You're hurting me.

59:08.242 --> 59:10.414
Tom, that really hurt.

59:18.493 --> 59:20.047
I'm here, aren't I?

59:23.947 --> 59:26.085
Isn't that real enough?

01:01:51.405 --> 01:01:53.303
I try every day
to leave the Vale.

01:01:54.442 --> 01:01:58.203
Days pass, years pass,
music is changing,

01:01:58.205 --> 01:01:59.827
life is going on without me.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:05.003
Lady Lucy hunts
for me, every day.

01:02:05.005 --> 01:02:07.730
I still don't know what
the spirit wants from me.

01:02:07.732 --> 01:02:09.078
I don't want to find out.

01:02:11.218 --> 01:02:13.114
I found out that Lady Lucy kills

01:02:13.116 --> 01:02:15.116
everything she goes past.

01:02:15.118 --> 01:02:17.742
Trees, flowers will
die in her presence.

01:02:19.122 --> 01:02:22.194
The smell of her perfume lets
me know when she's close.

01:02:23.955 --> 01:02:27.094
I read every one
of Carl's diaries

01:02:27.096 --> 01:02:30.166
about what happened to
Lucy on her wedding night.

01:02:30.168 --> 01:02:32.722
She does seem to
be scared of fire.

01:03:05.203 --> 01:03:07.861
Come on you bitch, what
are you waiting for?

01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:11.002
It's right there,
waiting for you.

01:03:12.969 --> 01:03:14.074
Go for the nice dolly.

01:03:15.351 --> 01:03:16.248
Bitch, come on.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:19.804
Where are you?

01:03:26.776 --> 01:03:27.604
Come on.

01:03:31.643 --> 01:03:32.471
Come on.

01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:55.699
How do
you like it, eh?

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:57.393
You're the one
that's trapped now.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:03:59.807
So what do you want from me, eh?

01:03:59.809 --> 01:04:01.257
I'm right here.

01:04:01.259 --> 01:04:02.122
What do you want?

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:09.541
Why did you have to take
her, what did she ever do?

01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:11.336
What have I ever done?

01:05:18.198 --> 01:05:19.991
Hello mate, you all right?

01:05:19.993 --> 01:05:21.509
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

01:05:21.511 --> 01:05:24.478
Listen, who told you that
this bridge was haunted?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.205
And the area around
it, who said that,

01:05:27.207 --> 01:05:29.209
where did you get
your information from?

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.797
So you've not got any sold
proof or anything like that?

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.213
You've got no solid proof?

01:05:35.215 --> 01:05:36.869
'Cause this is what I need,
this is why I've been,

01:05:36.871 --> 01:05:39.527
I've been setting triggers
off and objects and stuff.

01:05:39.529 --> 01:05:41.253
I've been here for days now,

01:05:41.255 --> 01:05:43.117
and I'm just not
gettin' anything.

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:45.499
And I need that proof,
obviously for the book.

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:47.294
'Cause I don't, I don't
wanna pass off information

01:05:47.296 --> 01:05:49.815
that, that I've got no,
you know, I can't back up.

01:05:50.955 --> 01:05:52.542
So you've not got
anything over here?

01:05:53.578 --> 01:05:54.818
All right, all right.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.614
Well, no, I'm not
going now obviously,

01:05:57.616 --> 01:05:59.271
'cause it's gonna
piss it down tonight.

01:05:59.273 --> 01:06:01.584
So, it's not gonna happen.

01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:03.622
All right pal, see
you later, ta-da.

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:42.133
Holy spirit descend
on this earth.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.678
Hello, is anyone
there, can you hear me?

01:09:53.127 --> 01:09:55.507
Hello, is anybody there?

01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:57.129
Hello, hello, yes, my name...

01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:58.786
- Yeah, we can hear you, yeah.
- my name's Tom Crow.

01:09:58.788 --> 01:10:01.306
- Please, please help me.
- Hello?

01:10:01.308 --> 01:10:04.240
I'm, I'm trapped in this
place called the Vale.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.898
I don't know exactly
where it is but...

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.492
Hello, hello?

01:10:14.494 --> 01:10:15.424
- Is anybody there?
- What's the date?

01:10:15.426 --> 01:10:16.666
Could you tell me the date?

01:10:16.668 --> 01:10:19.324
Yeah,
we can hear you, yeah.

01:10:19.326 --> 01:10:20.189
Hello?

01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:23.365
- Hello.
- That's not the date.

01:11:01.368 --> 01:11:02.749
My name is Anna Sterling.

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.681
This will be my last diary entry

01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:07.719
before I try and leave
the Vale for good.

01:11:10.446 --> 01:11:13.620
Strange but the Vale
is getting quiet now.

01:11:13.622 --> 01:11:15.727
I'm not sure if I'm
the last person here.

01:11:17.798 --> 01:11:20.214
The spirit of Lady
Lucy's stalking me.

01:11:21.423 --> 01:11:24.322
Oh god, I'm so scared of
even leaving my house.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.637
Sometimes, I look
through the window

01:11:30.224 --> 01:11:32.537
and I can see her floating across
the lake, carrying a doll.

01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:37.646
She doesn't seem to have
any eyes, just black holes.

01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:41.546
And does she know I'm here?

01:11:43.307 --> 01:11:45.514
Maybe she's looking for me.

01:11:45.516 --> 01:11:48.551
It's only a matter of time
until she comes to my home.

01:11:48.553 --> 01:11:52.072
I pray most of the
time, just to stay sane.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.143
I will use the lantern
at the Vale sign

01:11:54.145 --> 01:11:56.732
to guide me through the
darkness of the Vale.

01:11:56.734 --> 01:11:58.701
And I must stay
away from the mist.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:02.600
Caroline went in there
and I never saw her again.

01:12:02.602 --> 01:12:04.498
I've got to pack my
things and leave.

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:08.677
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:12:10.782 --> 01:12:15.198
Thy kingdom come.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.342
Thy will be done on
earth as in heaven

01:12:20.344 --> 01:12:23.068
Give us this day
our daily bread.

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.139
Forgive our trespasses,

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:28.800
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:33.426
Lead us not into temptation,

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.361
deliver us from evil.

01:12:40.329 --> 01:12:44.506
Amen.

01:14:18.703 --> 01:14:20.912
Come on Lucy, come and get me.

01:14:22.638 --> 01:14:23.467
Come on!

01:14:28.782 --> 01:14:29.611
Come on!

01:18:42.622 --> 01:18:43.897
I know I'm safe in this circle

01:18:43.899 --> 01:18:46.728
but time is running out for me.

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:50.179
I've got a drop of water
left in this bottle,

01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:52.492
and then I'll go to
the river for more.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:54.668
I see things, horrible things.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.808
Two days ago I saw
what looked like a dog

01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:59.363
but with a human body.

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:02.228
It walked backwards
into the darkness.

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:05.919
I keep hoping I'm just
having a nightmare

01:19:05.921 --> 01:19:09.062
and I'll wake up,
with Leah by my side.

01:19:10.477 --> 01:19:13.340
I also saw something that
I can't quite explain,

01:19:13.342 --> 01:19:16.380
a person with holes for
eyes, just like Lady Lucy.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.346
It tried to touch
me, it was wrapped up

01:19:19.348 --> 01:19:23.007
in cotton wool of some sort
or, cobwebs wrapped around it.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:29.218
The sand didn't work, it walked
straight into the circle.

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.601
It was the size of a child.

01:19:32.051 --> 01:19:34.637
I grabbed my water bottle
and launched it into it,

01:19:34.639 --> 01:19:36.400
it went straight
through the thing.

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.920
Then it turned around and
flew towards the bottle.

01:19:40.922 --> 01:19:42.993
Is there more than
one ghost in the Vale?

01:19:45.271 --> 01:19:46.548
What do you want from me?

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.710
I don't care, all right.

01:20:12.746 --> 01:20:13.817
I don't care.

01:20:17.268 --> 01:20:18.545
Just leave me alone.

01:20:21.307 --> 01:20:23.067
For god sake, leave me alone.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:28.797
Just leave me alone,
just leave me alone.

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:32.005
Please just leave me alone.

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:52.510
Get off me.

01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:55.201
Get off.

01:20:55.203 --> 01:20:56.135
Get off me.

01:21:18.985 --> 01:21:19.848
Leah.

01:21:24.059 --> 01:21:25.302
What's the matter, Tom?

01:21:30.376 --> 01:21:31.858
You're alive.

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.068
What's the matter, Tom?

01:21:35.001 --> 01:21:36.623
What do you need?

01:21:40.248 --> 01:21:43.490
You don't love
me anymore, do you?

01:21:43.492 --> 01:21:45.147
Of course I do.

01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:46.804
Why don't you love
me anymore, Tom?

01:21:46.806 --> 01:21:47.634
I do.

01:21:48.912 --> 01:21:49.740
Leah,

01:21:52.156 --> 01:21:53.397
of course I do.

01:21:53.399 --> 01:21:54.400
You don't.

01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:59.675
You don't love me anymore, why?

01:21:59.677 --> 01:22:03.857
Don't say that, of course
I do, I'll never stop.

01:22:07.447 --> 01:22:08.793
I'll never stop.

01:22:11.279 --> 01:22:13.148
Leah, I love you, I always will.

01:22:20.012 --> 01:22:20.944
I love you.

01:23:19.859 --> 01:23:24.859
