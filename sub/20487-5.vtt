The C-130 Hercules
is past the point of no return,

00:11.167 --> 00:12.867
the point at which
there's not enough fuel

00:12.900 --> 00:14.800
to safely turn back, no matter

00:14.833 --> 00:17.133
what the weather is on the ice.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.733
It's loud back here,

00:18.767 --> 00:22.300
the moan of four massive
props relentless.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.133
I'm dressed like all of us

00:24.167 --> 00:25.393
who've been approved
to make this journey

00:25.400 --> 00:27.167

thick goose down parka

00:34.067 --> 00:36.167
known by one and all as Big Red,

00:36.200 --> 00:38.000
heavy waterproof overalls,

00:38.033 --> 00:39.867
inflatable buddy boots,

00:39.900 --> 00:42.100
gloves, long underwear, cap.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.100
I am talking layers.

The runway is frozen
sea ice, 10 feet thick.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.000
The airport shuttle,
Ivan the Terra Bus,

02:46.033 --> 02:47.700
a "Road Warrior" -looking
behemoth

02:47.733 --> 02:50.433
that takes us slowly
towards our destination.

02:50.467 --> 02:55.500
We're driving Ivan.
40 feet long. 67,000 pounds.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.033
23 years old.

02:57.067 --> 03:00.867
Made out of some
good Canadian steel.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.133
Sometimes the heat
actually works.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.667
This year it does.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.500
It is no short hop
to Antarctica,

03:08.533 --> 03:14.233
and no easy thing to see it
the way it should be seen:

03:14.267 --> 03:18.200
the last un-[...]-up
place on Earth.

03:25.267 --> 03:30.633
Here we are. Try to get plenty
of rest and enjoy the Antarctic.

03:30.667 --> 03:34.967
McMurdo Station, the largest
U.S. base on the continent.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.633
The hub, supply
and support center

03:36.667 --> 03:39.067
for everything we do
here in Antarctica.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.767
The pursuit of pure science.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.433
It ain't pretty.
It looks like a mining camp.

03:44.467 --> 03:46.500
But look closely
and you notice things,

03:46.533 --> 03:48.667
like the total absence
of litter.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.067
Not a single cigarette butt.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.867
It's one of the most
carefully-regulated

03:52.900 --> 03:55.067
communities on the planet,

03:55.100 --> 03:57.300
and it is a community...
A tightly-knit,

03:57.333 --> 03:59.700
highly-organized,
very odd subculture

03:59.733 --> 04:02.333
of just under
1,000 people in summer

04:02.367 --> 04:06.667
and 150 in winter all working
towards the same thing

04:06.700 --> 04:08.900
in this most remote, barren,

04:08.933 --> 04:11.900
yet stunningly
beautiful continent.

04:11.933 --> 04:14.767
Work is seasonal in McMurdo,
and it's the type of place

04:14.800 --> 04:18.899
that demands a very special
kind of individual.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.033
Everyone is interdependent

04:21.067 --> 04:24.167
and comes to realize
that very quickly.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.300
The scientists, known
in local parlance

04:26.333 --> 04:29.200
as "beakers," depend absolutely

04:29.233 --> 04:30.967
on a support community
of specialists

04:31.000 --> 04:33.200
like the "carps," or carpenters,

04:33.233 --> 04:35.100
heavy equipment operators,

04:35.133 --> 04:38.433
the fuelies, riggers, pilots,

04:38.467 --> 04:40.733
wasties, cooks.

04:40.767 --> 04:43.667
Like I said, it takes
a special breed of hard-ass

04:43.700 --> 04:46.900
to not just make it
down here, but like it.

04:46.933 --> 04:49.967
You got to be tough.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.167
Right now I love
being in McMurdo,

04:52.200 --> 04:56.433
because it's like being
at a spa for scientists.

04:56.467 --> 05:00.200
Doug MacAyeal is one of the
world's preeminent glaciologists

05:00.233 --> 05:03.200
who's been coming to Antarctica
since the '70s.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.033
The Coffee House,

05:05.067 --> 05:07.300
one of three watering
holes on station.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.200
It's not much to look at,

05:09.233 --> 05:11.400
but offers a welcome
respite from the cold.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.733
One thing about this continent
that's special

05:13.767 --> 05:15.167
is the vertical hierarchy.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.033
Everybody respects up
and down equally.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.167
The janitor really
does have a sense

05:20.200 --> 05:23.033
that their action
is right at the frontline.

05:23.067 --> 05:25.600
That doesn't happen
as much elsewhere in the world

05:25.633 --> 05:29.400
of science... tangibly
seeing a contribution.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.500
What brought you here?
It's cold down here.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.800
It's part of some
kind of personal honor.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.600
People who come as a scientist
might think of their science

05:36.633 --> 05:39.833
as driving them more than
thinking of coming to a place

05:39.867 --> 05:42.033
that is definitely different

05:42.067 --> 05:44.200
than anywhere else in the world.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.133
Despite its seemingly
endless whiteness,

05:54.167 --> 05:56.933
what you see is
a desert technically...

05:56.967 --> 05:59.900
The highest and driest
on the planet.

05:59.933 --> 06:03.333
A frozen desert holding 61%

06:03.367 --> 06:06.833
of the entire world's
fresh water.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.500
It looks like nothing lives.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.567
You won't see a single plant,
a single leaf,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.500
and certainly not a puppy.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.433
Even the sun this time
of year never sets.

06:17.467 --> 06:20.767
It moves in lazy circles
around the sky.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.233
But shit is indeed moving.

06:23.267 --> 06:25.933
Beneath your feet.
All around you.

06:25.967 --> 06:27.800
Just very slowly.

06:27.833 --> 06:31.233
An ice shelf is a kind of
glacier that flows off the land

06:31.267 --> 06:32.967
but begins to float
in the ocean.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.900
- It's freshwater.
- It's freshwater ice,

06:34.933 --> 06:37.200
and the ice itself
varies from the snow,

06:37.233 --> 06:39.267
like today,
and down at the bottom,

06:39.300 --> 06:43.000
ice that might have fallen
as snow 35,000 years ago.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.333
It's the part of the Antarctic
ice sheet we call the Buttress

06:48.367 --> 06:51.300
because it fringes
the entire continent.

06:51.333 --> 06:54.367
It might take 50,000 years
for the ice at South Pole

06:54.400 --> 06:57.333
to get into the raw sea
and bust off as an iceberg.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.233
- Yeah.
- But it would take only 20,000

06:59.267 --> 07:00.733
years or even 10,000 years

07:00.767 --> 07:02.367
if the ice shelf wasn't there.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.967
This is the biggest pile
of free ice in the solar system.

07:08.033 --> 07:10.400
McMurdo is at the tip
of Ross Island,

07:10.433 --> 07:13.233
surrounded by miles
of frozen sea.

07:13.267 --> 07:17.300
There are a lot of different
types of ice down here.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.100
Glaciology started about
50 years ago.

07:20.133 --> 07:22.200
Our entire science
is driven by the fact

07:22.233 --> 07:24.067
that we're still trying
to figure out

07:24.100 --> 07:26.500
what Antarctica is doing
in terms of sea level...

07:26.533 --> 07:29.033
How the ice sheet
is expanding or contracting,

07:29.067 --> 07:30.533
how it's flowing,

07:30.567 --> 07:32.233
whether it melts in some places,

07:32.267 --> 07:35.367
how it busts off icebergs
that float away on the ocean.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.700
And we're trying to come up
with some kind of a solid,

07:38.733 --> 07:40.400
reliable statement

07:40.433 --> 07:44.000
about what cities like
San Francisco and New York

07:44.033 --> 07:47.167
and Shanghai have to plan for.

07:50.933 --> 07:54.333
Antarctica for all too
obvious reasons remained free

07:54.367 --> 07:56.433
of any sustained human contact

07:56.467 --> 07:59.600
until the mid-20th century
when the U.S. Navy

07:59.633 --> 08:01.400
launched Operation Deep Freeze,

08:01.433 --> 08:04.300
an enormous logistical
enterprise that established

08:04.333 --> 08:09.400
the first permanent base
here at McMurdo in 1955.

08:09.433 --> 08:11.900
Deep down
in the ice caves were cut,

08:11.933 --> 08:13.900
and here the supplies
were packed away

08:13.933 --> 08:15.933
in a natural fridge.

08:18.133 --> 08:21.233
Frozen meat perfectly preserved,
but where's that axe?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.433
Let's have a bit
of 15-year-old ham.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.367
Since the National
Science Foundation

08:29.400 --> 08:32.067
took over from the Navy,
things have gotten a lot less

08:32.100 --> 08:34.067
Wild West around here.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.100
It feels like dorm life
at college.

08:36.133 --> 08:38.267
Bathrooms are communal.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.633
Everybody rotates
housekeeping duties.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.567
And everybody shuffles off
at designated hours

08:43.600 --> 08:44.767
to the galley,

08:44.800 --> 08:46.267
where the cooks do the very best

08:46.300 --> 08:48.767
they can, given
the infrequent delivery

08:48.800 --> 08:52.033
of what are called with longing
tones around here

08:52.067 --> 08:53.667
"freshies,"

08:53.700 --> 08:57.900
or anything not frozen,
canned, or prepared.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.467
Little connectivity I have

08:59.500 --> 09:01.126
with the outside world
I owe entirely to you.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.033
You've been
helping me enormously.

09:03.067 --> 09:06.567
Joanie works IT and has been
coming here for nine seasons.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.408
But it's coming, right?
I mean, sooner or later,

09:08.433 --> 09:09.967
they're gonna put
a satellite up there

09:10.000 --> 09:11.467
and everyone
down here is gonna...

09:11.500 --> 09:12.860
Maybe. I mean, we could be
a long way away

09:12.867 --> 09:14.700
from have cell service down here

09:14.733 --> 09:16.633
and everybody having internet
like that at home.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.500
It's really the last place
on Earth for cell service.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.867
Christy is a heavy
equipment operator

09:21.900 --> 09:23.533
coming for 19 seasons.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.233
I actually started off
in two seasons in the galley,

09:26.267 --> 09:28.433
and then I ended up getting
trained on the equipment.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.900
So, you learned an entirely
new profession

09:30.933 --> 09:32.600
so that you could stay here?

09:32.633 --> 09:33.933
- Yeah.
- And Jules,

09:33.967 --> 09:35.733
another heavy equipment operator

09:35.767 --> 09:38.133
who can most likely
kick your ass, eat your lunch,

09:38.167 --> 09:39.800
then kick your ass again,

09:39.833 --> 09:42.233
has been coming
for an astonishing 38 seasons.

09:42.267 --> 09:43.967
So, what were you doing before?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.160
See, my mom worked
for the company

09:45.167 --> 09:46.600
and she wanted me to come.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.367
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause I didn't want to come.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.793
She was trying to get rid
of you or what?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.433
Yeah. She wanted to come.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.126
When you first started coming,
how many women were here?

09:53.133 --> 09:54.633
What was the ratio?

09:54.667 --> 09:56.233
My first two years
were at South Pole.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.867
There were probably
90 civilians.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.700
I was the only female
at South Pole,

10:00.733 --> 10:02.667
and there were probably
12 total at McMurdo

10:02.700 --> 10:04.333
and probably 1,100 men.

10:04.367 --> 10:05.793
Was the Navy still
running the place back then?

10:05.800 --> 10:06.993
Yes, and I had a lot of respect

10:07.000 --> 10:08.467
because the United States Navy

10:08.500 --> 10:10.367
was the one that integrated
this place,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.026
and originally down here
it was kind of this thing like,

10:12.033 --> 10:13.900
"Shall we let women be here?"

10:13.933 --> 10:15.533
Right.

10:15.567 --> 10:16.960
And then we had an admiral
come down and he's like,

10:16.967 --> 10:18.533
"Dude, where's all the women?"

10:18.567 --> 10:21.500
And, "Oh, we don't have
facilities for them."

10:21.533 --> 10:24.767
And he said, "Well, you goddamn
better get facilities for them."

10:24.800 --> 10:27.200
When I first came down here,
the company was all about,

10:27.233 --> 10:28.667
"Hey, this is special."

10:28.700 --> 10:30.500
There's not very many civilians,

10:30.533 --> 10:34.633
"you know, it's wild and free
and it's a great place to be."

10:34.667 --> 10:37.733
Just looking out the window,
having seen what you see

10:37.767 --> 10:39.233
on a regular basis

10:39.267 --> 10:40.833
and experienced
what you experience,

10:40.867 --> 10:43.567
is that an alienating
experience?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.900
I really appreciate
how simple life is

10:46.933 --> 10:48.700
and how little you need
to get by.

10:48.733 --> 10:51.200
Like, you just pack a couple
duffel bags and you come down.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.300
But then I find when I go home,

10:53.333 --> 10:54.900
sometimes I get
caught up in the,

10:54.933 --> 10:57.100
"I want. I need.
I want. I need."

10:57.133 --> 10:59.967
And that's the part
that kind of bums me out.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.260
And that's one of the things
I like about it

11:01.267 --> 11:03.167
is that there's no rat race.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.833
There's no errands. It's a
pretty egalitarian society here.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.233
NSF sitting down at tables
with us, and the janitors

11:08.267 --> 11:09.767
and the fuelies are as important

11:09.800 --> 11:11.026
as the people
who run the station.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.367
Nothing gets done without power,

11:12.400 --> 11:13.767
and there's no power
without fuel.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.133
There's no fuel without roads,

11:15.167 --> 11:16.800
There's no roads without
heavy equipment.

11:16.833 --> 11:18.567
So, it just kind of goes
from there

11:18.600 --> 11:22.167
and you kind of appreciate
what everybody else's role is.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.867
This is a place where things
are more powerful

11:24.900 --> 11:26.733
that don't involve money.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.367
You make lifelong friendships.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.200
The beauty of this place
is astounding.

11:30.233 --> 11:32.367
- There's no doubt.
- It's such a unique experience.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.800
There is something
magical about being here.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.233
A shared experience.

11:36.267 --> 11:38.267
You know, a lot of people
get really hooked

11:38.300 --> 11:41.567
on this place in its principal,

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
I guess,

11:42.633 --> 11:44.567
as to what it is.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.233
In Antarctica,
the sun sets once a year

12:04.267 --> 12:06.967
and rises once a year.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.600
Some twilight in late March,

12:08.633 --> 12:11.367
then five months of darkness
and extreme cold

12:11.400 --> 12:15.500
and weather conditions
lasting until September.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.467
Six months of daylight...

12:17.500 --> 12:20.100
The Antarctic summer season
where we are now.

12:20.133 --> 12:24.567
Constant sunlight
reflecting off the ice,

12:24.600 --> 12:28.533
and it can and does
fry the brain.

12:43.967 --> 12:44.467
♪

12:49.000 --> 12:50.567
All right.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.400
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Romano,

12:52.433 --> 12:55.000
and this is the Hot Cup
of Joe Radio Show.

12:56.767 --> 12:59.967
We're gonna spin
some tunes here.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.133
I have a special guest
in here today.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.100
Here to visit us
at McMurdo Station,

13:05.133 --> 13:07.733
Antarctica, Mr. Tony Bourdain.

13:07.767 --> 13:08.267
♪

13:37.833 --> 13:38.333
♪

13:50.133 --> 13:52.567
There are no roads
and few suitable runways

13:52.600 --> 13:54.500
beyond McMurdo.

13:54.533 --> 14:00.167
For short hops, the main mode
of transportation is helicopter.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.833
Ryan Skorecki gets a lot
of flying time

14:02.867 --> 14:05.867
shuttling scientists to and from
remote field camps.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.500
So, that's Mount Lister.

14:07.533 --> 14:10.033
That's probably 60
or 70 miles away,

14:10.067 --> 14:12.200
and that's over
14,000 feet high.

14:12.233 --> 14:15.400
- Looks close.
- Yeah.

14:15.433 --> 14:18.400
Look at that massive
snow bridge right there, huh?

14:24.967 --> 14:27.367
There's some good
building-sized blocks.

14:32.267 --> 14:35.700
- How deep are those crevices?
- They could swallow buildings.

14:35.733 --> 14:37.467
It's very impressive.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.167
So, that's what you don't want
to hit with your snowmobile?

14:40.200 --> 14:41.367
Right.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.833
People climb around
in those things?

14:42.867 --> 14:44.567
They don't usually.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.667
They'll have drills to practice
extricating somebody.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.400
There is a steep learning
curve to flying down here.

14:49.433 --> 14:52.133
Skillfully handling gale
force winds,

14:52.167 --> 14:54.267
reduced control
at high altitudes,

14:54.300 --> 14:56.900
and the unpredictability
of extreme turbulence

14:56.933 --> 14:59.400
around mountains
and active volcanoes.

14:59.433 --> 15:03.967
Slowly but surely climbing.
And it's -20° outside.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.500
- Erebus.
- And that's Mount Terror.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.267
This is Mount Erebus,

15:09.300 --> 15:13.133
the southernmost
active volcano on Earth.

15:21.933 --> 15:25.967
Antarctica was a great mystery
for most of human history.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.733
Only a theory.

15:27.767 --> 15:31.500
A great white space
at the bottom of the world.

15:31.533 --> 15:34.533
We're just passing 8,500.
So, we'll go another 4,000.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.833
You're gonna see the main crater
in just a second.

15:37.867 --> 15:40.400
The conditions endured by
the first British

15:40.433 --> 15:43.633
Antarctica explorers
like Scott and Shackleton,

15:43.667 --> 15:45.300
and Norwegian Amundsen,

15:45.333 --> 15:47.767
and the lengths of time
they endured them are,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.967
well, horrifying to imagine.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.400
They made their journeys
in wooden ships,

15:53.433 --> 15:56.267
man-hauling equipment
across glaciers,

15:56.300 --> 15:58.067
ice floes, mountains,

15:58.100 --> 16:01.633
and frozen seas surviving
on penguin meat

16:01.667 --> 16:03.900
when rations ran out.

16:05.533 --> 16:08.200
You might start
to smell some sulfur.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.733
Yeah. I smell that sulfur.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.900
What's our altitude now?

16:17.933 --> 16:21.500
13,200.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.600
Cool.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.067
About 22 miles from McMurdo

16:31.100 --> 16:33.900
is Cape Royds,
where a penguin colony

16:33.933 --> 16:36.900
of about 2,000
breeding pairs live.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.200
Marine ecologist
Dr. David Ainley

16:39.233 --> 16:42.900
has been studying
this colony for 20 years.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.133
So, you're tagging
the young ones?

16:48.167 --> 16:49.533
Right.

16:49.567 --> 16:50.793
Do you follow them
through their entire life?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.333
I mean, essentially?

16:52.367 --> 16:54.500
Yeah. This year we've got
a bunch of individuals

16:54.533 --> 16:56.167
that are 20 years old.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.833
Why penguins? What brought you
to penguins initially?

16:58.867 --> 17:00.467
Well, this kind of penguin

17:00.500 --> 17:02.700
just does everything
with no secrets.

17:02.733 --> 17:04.233
- Right.
- If you, you know,

17:04.267 --> 17:06.400
ask the right question
and you're creative enough,

17:06.433 --> 17:08.099
then they're gonna
give you the answer

17:08.133 --> 17:10.067
without a lot of guessing.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.367
What really interests me
is the relationship

17:12.400 --> 17:13.867
of these penguins to the ocean.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.300
Mm.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.433
And how they fit
into the food web.

17:17.467 --> 17:20.133
During the '90s,
small colonies like Cape Royds

17:20.166 --> 17:22.400
were increasing much faster
than the large colonies

17:22.433 --> 17:25.599
where the competition
for food was so intense.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.099
In the last ten years,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.733
colonies started
increasing again.

17:28.767 --> 17:34.133
We think it's because of fishery
for Antarctic toothfish.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.267
The toothfish and the penguins
eat the same prey,

17:36.300 --> 17:39.267
so now there's more
fish available for adults

17:39.300 --> 17:41.000
to capture
and then feed to their chicks.

17:41.033 --> 17:42.533
Oh, so there's less competition,

17:42.567 --> 17:45.567
therefore more
of the same prey available?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.867
Yeah.

17:49.733 --> 17:51.393
I haven't seen a lot of them
going in the water,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.567
but they're looking
for some indicator

17:53.600 --> 17:55.000
that there's fish down there?

17:55.033 --> 17:56.526
They're afraid to cross
this ice crack

17:56.533 --> 17:58.800
because leopard seals
might be in them.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.267
They're very hesitant.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.500
So then finally
they make the plunge.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.293
I mean, they're very agile.
They don't look it.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.067
At first blush
they appear clumsy,

18:06.100 --> 18:07.867
but watching them,
they got a lot of moves.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.500
Yeah. They're very, very agile.

18:10.533 --> 18:13.167
Increasingly, people want
to see penguins.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.667
They're much-loved by,
you know, children everywhere.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.133
A lot of people would like to
come to Antarctica as tourists

18:18.167 --> 18:20.633
and look at penguins up close

18:20.667 --> 18:22.133
in their natural environment

18:22.167 --> 18:24.167
without impacting them
in a negative way.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.533
Is that a good thing?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.067
The thing about Antarctica

18:27.100 --> 18:29.067
is that most scientists
just kind of like,

18:29.100 --> 18:32.200
you know, keep their nose
to the grindstone.

18:32.233 --> 18:34.667
And so the only advocacy
for Antarctica

18:34.700 --> 18:36.533
has to come from the public.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.767
It's very valuable
to have these tours

18:38.800 --> 18:41.367
because then people have
an ownership of,

18:41.400 --> 18:43.093
you know, they've been there
and they see it.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.600
Mm-hmm.
What keeps you coming back?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.233
I mean, other than the work.

18:47.267 --> 18:49.833
I wanted to come to Antarctica
because I'd heard it was

18:49.867 --> 18:52.567
a very severe place
and, you know,

18:52.600 --> 18:57.100
nature was the king, daunting.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.233
Having that chance to be humbled

18:59.267 --> 19:03.567
by something greater
than you is, I think,

19:03.600 --> 19:06.133
an important part of being here.

19:32.467 --> 19:36.433
Not all of Antarctica
is covered with ice.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.967
60 miles out of town
are the dry valleys...

19:44.633 --> 19:48.400
The 1% of the continent
devoid of snowfall.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.233
Scott called it
the Valley of Death,

19:51.267 --> 19:53.933
and it feels like Mars.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.833
In fact,
they used to test out equipment

19:55.867 --> 19:58.367
for Martian exploration here.

20:11.067 --> 20:12.633
Desolate but beautiful.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.167
The Canada Glacier,
a wall of ice,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.867
right there where it seems
to have stopped short,

20:17.900 --> 20:22.367
pulled back scraping up
a beach on a frozen lake.

20:25.133 --> 20:26.967
Here is one of the NSF's oldest

20:27.000 --> 20:30.033
and more legendary
field camps... Lake Hoare.

20:30.067 --> 20:32.067
Everything comes
in by helicopter.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.633
The base here supports a small
team of scientists and staff

20:35.667 --> 20:38.300
working on a variety
of long-term projects.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.433
It is, however, most legendary
for this woman.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.700
- Hi. I'm Rae.
- Rae Spain, the camp's manager

20:43.733 --> 20:47.233
who's been coming to
Lake Hoare for 19 seasons.

20:47.267 --> 20:49.333
Said to be the best cook
on the continent.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.967
This in an environment
where so-called freshies...

20:53.000 --> 20:54.200
The rare fresh vegetable...

20:54.233 --> 20:55.933
Is spoken of in hushed tones

20:55.967 --> 20:58.867
of near-fetishistic
appreciation.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.333
Staying over at Lake Hoare
is a rare privilege

21:04.367 --> 21:07.600
enjoyed by few,
like Dr. Michael Gooseff,

21:07.633 --> 21:11.200
a hydroecologist, and Dr.
Byron Adams, a biologist.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.067
So, what are you
looking at here?

21:13.100 --> 21:15.167
Everything that lives
here lives in the soil,

21:15.200 --> 21:17.000
and we study the soil organisms.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.733
Mostly the animals
that live here

21:18.767 --> 21:22.200
but also the microbes
that those animals feed off of.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.167
- Right.
- This is just a marker

21:24.200 --> 21:25.633
to tell us to stay
on this trail.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.467
Okay.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.160
These soils are so sensitive
that if we walk off the trail

21:29.167 --> 21:31.133
or whatever, we can
completely jack up

21:31.167 --> 21:33.233
the soil organisms
that live below there.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.000
- Oh, like that guy?
- Yeah, like that dude.

21:35.033 --> 21:38.367
He's totally... oh,
he's gonna get wiped out.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.933
When scientists came
and first started studying,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.033
they thought that these
soils were sterile.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.167
But we dispelled that myth.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.700
When the glaciers melt
and the streams flow,

21:47.733 --> 21:49.500
that's where you find life.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.626
So, why does this area look
like this? Where's the ice?

21:51.633 --> 21:53.733
How come the ground
is so soft and spongy?

21:53.767 --> 21:57.233
The Polar Plateau where most
of the ice accumulates starts

21:57.267 --> 21:59.367
to spread out towards
the edges of the continent,

21:59.400 --> 22:02.333
but the Transantarctic
Mountains form a barrier

22:02.367 --> 22:04.000
so the ice sheet
hits the mountains

22:04.033 --> 22:05.700
and it can't get through.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.493
The other thing is that there
are these really gnarly winds

22:07.500 --> 22:09.700
that come off of them,
drop down on the plateau,

22:09.733 --> 22:11.233
and then rush toward the edges

22:11.267 --> 22:12.926
of the continent gushing
through these valleys.

22:12.933 --> 22:15.233
So, it's a fluky
microclimate here?

22:15.267 --> 22:18.200
We call it the Banana Belt
of Antarctica.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.200
It's warm. We're coastal.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.200
Life at Lake Hoare,
considering the limitations

22:22.233 --> 22:24.900
and the difficulties,
is freaking luxurious

22:24.933 --> 22:27.367
by continental standards.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.867
Out here, by the way,
as everywhere on the continent,

22:29.900 --> 22:33.667
every bit of waste
is separated and collected.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.900
One pees in a bottle
and pours it in the barrel

22:36.933 --> 22:41.567
where it is eventually collected
and shipped back to America.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.867
Life here most definitely
has its advantages.

22:49.900 --> 22:53.967
Rae and her staff seem always to
be making something delicious.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.100
Homemade bread, scones,

22:56.133 --> 22:58.967
muffins appear
throughout the day.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.067
Tonight, it's barbecue
pork tenderloin.

23:01.100 --> 23:04.933
Oh, that looks good.
Pork tenderloin? Damn.

23:04.967 --> 23:10.800
Grilled mahi sticks and shrimp
marinated in chili sauce.

23:10.833 --> 23:13.200
Homemade sourdough bread.

23:13.233 --> 23:14.767
A roasted beet salad.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.100
Oh, my gosh.
Look at the salad.

23:17.133 --> 23:20.400
It's so purple and it
has avocado in it.

23:20.433 --> 23:23.467
What cannot be fresh
is nonetheless delicious.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.967
Edamame salad with
cranberries and carrots.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.767
Roasted vegetables.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.833
One might find oneself
enjoying a cocktail or two.

23:31.867 --> 23:33.400
This is an amazing spread.

23:33.433 --> 23:35.433
I know. Mmm.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.133
What are you guys doing here?
What are you looking for?

23:39.167 --> 23:41.033
I'm collecting water samples
in the streams

23:41.067 --> 23:43.933
and also collecting samples
of the algae.

23:43.967 --> 23:46.100
We're looking at the sign
of bacteria mass

23:46.133 --> 23:50.133
which make this rainbow
shag rug in the streams,

23:50.167 --> 23:51.967
which is super-cool.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.093
Uh-huh. Well, you know, the
beginning of the 20th century

23:54.100 --> 23:57.200
when scientists and explorers
were national heroes,

23:57.233 --> 23:59.833
there was a hunger
for knowledge and discovery.

23:59.867 --> 24:02.900
Not a good climate for facts,
though, we live in today.

24:02.933 --> 24:05.300
- No.
- We may interpret our facts

24:05.333 --> 24:07.700
differently but we don't get
to make up our own facts, right?

24:07.733 --> 24:09.593
There are plenty of people
out there who believe

24:09.600 --> 24:11.200
"The Flintstones"

24:11.233 --> 24:13.167
is pretty much an accurate
portrayal of history.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.700
Don't laugh, Mike, that...

24:14.733 --> 24:17.333
Shut up. I know.

24:17.367 --> 24:19.333
They're funding our science
in large part.

24:19.367 --> 24:21.867
You want that connection between
the public and the scientist,

24:21.900 --> 24:24.500
and that's something we don't
do a great job of back home.

24:24.533 --> 24:26.200
I get this criticism
all the time, though,

24:26.233 --> 24:28.567
that you scientists need
to do a better job

24:28.600 --> 24:30.133
of presenting your research.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.867
I get that. But I'm a professor
at a university.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.967
I present knowledge
and information.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.367
It's in the classes.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.200
They learn
all this awesome stuff.

24:38.233 --> 24:40.833
They're thoughtful.
They enter the world.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.467
They make the world better.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.533
But they don't do it
in a five-minute soundbite.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.067
But we live in a terrible new
reality where you better have

24:47.100 --> 24:49.333
a five-minute soundbite,
or they're coming for you.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.067
Right, right.
We got to learn how to teach

24:51.100 --> 24:55.067
evolutionary biology
140 characters at a time.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.567
Yeah. Pretty much.

24:58.167 --> 24:59.526
See, you guys just
need better press.

24:59.533 --> 25:00.600
Yeah, yeah.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.333
You went gathering data

25:02.367 --> 25:05.667
that will potentially save
the world from flesh-eating,

25:05.700 --> 25:07.600
anal-seeking algae.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.300
♪

25:22.533 --> 25:25.400
You need a giant nematode
to rampage through West Virginia

25:25.433 --> 25:27.167
or some shit like that.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.900
Then everybody will be extremely
interested in what you're doing.

25:29.933 --> 25:33.367
In a battle between a nematode
and the algae, who's gonna win?

25:33.400 --> 25:34.800
The algae.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.800
- The nematodes eat algae.
- For now.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.067
I'm betting on algae.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.233
In this time you've all chosen
to come out here.

25:44.267 --> 25:47.300
You've all been born
in the wrong century.

25:47.333 --> 25:49.167
Why do you put up
with these people?

25:49.200 --> 25:52.733
'Cause everybody here
is such incredible people.

25:52.767 --> 25:55.600
I can't help it. I can't find
any place else like this.

25:55.633 --> 26:00.100
34 years later, I'm still
in love with the place.

26:00.133 --> 26:02.400
By the way, this is
an amazing meal.

26:02.433 --> 26:05.033
Lucky for us,
some freshies showed up today,

26:05.067 --> 26:07.100
because it gets really
challenging.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.700
It's her superpower.

26:10.733 --> 26:12.567
'Cause I've got, like,
four drawers of spices.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.033
Mm-hmm.

26:14.067 --> 26:15.667
I think that can make
a difference.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.667
- Makes it different.
- That meal was delicious.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.433
Thank you. This is sort of
the last place on Earth

26:22.467 --> 26:26.667
where pure science
seems to be celebrated

26:26.700 --> 26:28.267
at every level of society,

26:28.300 --> 26:31.500
where people are making
great personal sacrifices

26:31.533 --> 26:33.033
in pursuit of knowledge.

26:33.067 --> 26:35.900
That sounds quaint
where I come from.

26:35.933 --> 26:39.267
But it's an entire
continent of seekers...

26:39.300 --> 26:40.567
- Yeah.
- In a world that is

26:40.600 --> 26:42.067
increasingly hostile

26:42.100 --> 26:44.500
to basically everything
you're all about.

26:44.533 --> 26:48.233
It's quite wonderful.

26:48.267 --> 26:50.233
Wouldn't that be great,
though, huh?

26:50.267 --> 26:53.400
If everyone played as nice
as we do with other nations?

26:53.433 --> 26:57.867
Working together to do science,
collaborating?

26:57.900 --> 26:59.400
- Yeah.
- Dream on, buddy.

27:06.433 --> 27:09.100
The meal is followed by
a precarious trip

27:09.133 --> 27:11.833
across the frozen lake
to the beach.

27:11.867 --> 27:17.100
Because what's Antarctica about
if it ain't about a beach party?

27:20.800 --> 27:21.300
♪

27:49.900 --> 27:51.567
Gear 22.
Mack Center. Go ahead.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.067
Gear 22, at 8-2-niner.

28:01.033 --> 28:03.167
Gear 22, Roger. Thank you.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.433
Another C-130.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.933
The big, gorgeous workhorse
of the Antarctic

28:10.967 --> 28:13.167
gets you to the ass-end
of the planet,

28:13.200 --> 28:16.967
where it's north
every direction you go.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.133
Bottom of the world.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.033
So, I like to say this is
the biggest airplane

28:21.067 --> 28:22.700
you can do little
airplane things with...

28:22.733 --> 28:24.800
Sea, ski planes,
or float planes...

28:24.833 --> 28:26.933
And we're trying to do
those same types of missions

28:26.967 --> 28:29.800
with a C-130, which is unusual.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.826
Everything they built
the station actually came on one

28:31.833 --> 28:33.200
of these C-130s.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.600
They had to build it
using trusses

28:35.633 --> 28:39.367
and pieces that could fit
in the confines of a LC-130.

28:39.400 --> 28:44.500
It's a fun job. And to support
the scientists is fantastic.

28:44.533 --> 28:47.667
In just a few hours, we cross
the Ross Ice Shelf,

28:47.700 --> 28:49.633
fly up the Beardmore Glacier

28:49.667 --> 28:52.967
into the heart of Antarctica...
The Polar Plateau.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.600
How many miles from McMurdo
to the Pole?

28:55.633 --> 28:56.600
Around?

28:56.633 --> 28:58.467
735 miles.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.826
And Scott had to walk that?
What was going through his mind?

29:00.833 --> 29:03.100
He loved to suffer.

29:03.133 --> 29:04.733
The first explorers who got here

29:04.767 --> 29:06.467
or came close raced

29:06.500 --> 29:08.633
across the continent
striving to be the first.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.900
Amundsen made it
before anyone in 1911,

29:11.933 --> 29:14.900
beating Scott by only 34 days.

29:14.933 --> 29:19.267
Amundsen wisely used huskies to
pull his sleds across the ice.

29:19.300 --> 29:23.600
Scott didn't, and his team
never made it back alive.

29:26.467 --> 29:29.167
The South Pole.
What you might not know

29:29.200 --> 29:31.933
or be prepared for is,
the South Pole is high.

29:31.967 --> 29:35.900
Like, 9,000 feet
above sea level.

29:35.933 --> 29:38.567
And it's cold.
Real cold.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.100
But you knew that.

29:40.133 --> 29:44.267
You feel the altitude.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.967
Today, the base at South Pole

29:46.000 --> 29:48.167
has the feel of a space
station... a warm,

29:48.200 --> 29:52.367
comfortable bubble in the middle
of, well, the great void.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.833
It can be incredibly
harsh out there with winds

29:54.867 --> 29:56.667
reaching as high as 50 knots

29:56.700 --> 30:01.067
and temperatures regularly
dropping below -50° Fahrenheit.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.300
About 200 scientists

30:04.333 --> 30:06.233
and staff work here
during the summer season.

30:06.267 --> 30:08.467
Some of the few freshies
I've got left.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.333
Oh, really?
Chef Bryan Denham

30:10.367 --> 30:13.100

30:13.133 --> 30:15.467
He's been coming here
for about five seasons,

30:15.500 --> 30:18.233
wintering over
for three of those.

30:18.267 --> 30:20.867
Again, one makes a lot
with a little.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.967
What do you think
a likely common thread

30:23.000 --> 30:24.733
is between all of the people

30:24.767 --> 30:26.533
who choose to come
to this place?

30:26.567 --> 30:28.160
Everybody's got a spirit
of adventure here.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.633
It's really cool
because you think,

30:29.667 --> 30:31.367
"Oh, I've done some
pretty cool things,"

30:31.400 --> 30:32.626
and then you talk
to someone else and you say,

30:32.633 --> 30:33.733
"Oh, I've done nothing."

Dr. Stuart Jefferies

30:37.033 --> 30:38.467
First year, it's
for the adventure.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.300
The second year,
it's for the money.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.967
The third year is 'cause
you don't fit anywhere else.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.433
You can't punch it
anywhere else.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.133
That's right.

Siri Grossman runs
equipment and supply.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.033
I really love it here.

30:49.067 --> 30:50.260
I feel like I live
on a space station.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.867
I keep coming back.

30:51.900 --> 30:54.867
It's damn good.
Like after a hard day

30:54.900 --> 30:58.067
of dragging blocks of ice,
this is exactly what you need.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.733
Mm-hmm.
People that work outside,

30:59.767 --> 31:02.933
I mean, they'll burn 5,000,
6,000 calories a day.

31:02.967 --> 31:05.933
Generally speaking, people can
work between one and four hours

31:05.967 --> 31:07.367
at a time before they need to...

31:07.400 --> 31:09.033
- Come in and get warmed up.
- Yeah.

31:09.067 --> 31:10.226
- Yeah.
- We eat pretty good down here

31:10.233 --> 31:11.633
considering where we are.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.400
We got a five-week menu cycle.

31:13.433 --> 31:15.500
- Right.
- Every Friday for four weeks

31:15.533 --> 31:17.133
is New York strips.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.060
On the fifth week, we do
filet mignon and crab legs.

31:19.067 --> 31:23.000
We don't really do fancy food.
We just basic food well.

31:23.033 --> 31:24.226
You're doing filet mignon
with crab legs.

31:24.233 --> 31:26.233
Eh, that's every five weeks.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.160
Right. How do you deal with
vegetarians with no freshies?

31:28.167 --> 31:30.433
We got lots of frozen
and canned stuff.

31:30.467 --> 31:32.733
It's like justice.

31:32.767 --> 31:33.933
Yeah.

31:33.967 --> 31:35.600
Who determines the playlist?

31:35.633 --> 31:38.533
It's usually whoever's shift
is going on at the time.

31:38.567 --> 31:41.200
I think there was a complaint
one day about the music.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.400
Then they picked this
really awful song the next day

31:43.433 --> 31:45.333
and they played it over
and over and over.

31:45.367 --> 31:47.600
It was "Afternoon Delight."
We just put it on loop.

31:47.633 --> 31:49.433
We started listening
to German talk radio, too.

31:49.467 --> 31:51.833
- German talk radio?
- Yeah.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.567
So, what do you do here?

31:53.600 --> 31:56.200
We look at the inside of
the sun through seismic probing.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.333
No one's looking
for frozen Nazi cyborgs?

31:58.367 --> 32:00.137
I think they get those
in the top few layers.

32:00.167 --> 32:02.900
They're around here somewhere.
I'm sure of it.

It's ish.

33:20.367 --> 33:22.333
I can tell you it scorches

the lungs and creeps
through your heavy outerwear.

33:27.267 --> 33:31.067
enormous lake down there,

Pump that fresh water
supply up to the station.

33:36.367 --> 33:38.100
It gets treated
at the power plant.

- Yeah.
- The rest comes back down.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.767
Recirculated as hot,
which then melts more ice.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.800
- Right.
- There's a giant hole

33:44.833 --> 33:48.200
in the ground that contains
our sewage for future removable.

Water on top,
sewer on the bottom.

It's the third generation
South Pole Telescope camera.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.533
16,000 pixels.

34:33.567 --> 34:35.300
It weighs about 2,500 pounds.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.433
In a couple days, we're gonna
pull it up into the telescope

34:38.467 --> 34:41.333
and try and see if we can
hit the sky with it.

34:41.367 --> 34:44.199
Very cool. It's like
a Bond villain stuff, you know.

34:44.233 --> 34:45.567
Yeah, I know. That's right.

34:46.967 --> 34:48.632
Astrophysicists like Dan Marrone

34:48.667 --> 34:50.800
will be looking through
those telescopes at,

34:50.833 --> 34:53.100
get this, Sagittarius A...

34:53.132 --> 34:56.600
The freakin' black hole
at the center of the Milky Way.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.326
We think we know what
black holes look like,

34:58.333 --> 35:00.467
but no one's ever actually
looked at one,

35:00.500 --> 35:03.133
and if you can build a telescope
the size of the entire Earth,

35:03.167 --> 35:05.700
you can actually see
with enough resolution

35:05.733 --> 35:07.200
to watch things swirling around

35:07.233 --> 35:09.267
and disappearing
into the black hole.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.333
We're basically taking
every similar telescope

35:11.367 --> 35:13.833
in the world
to synthesize one telescope

35:13.867 --> 35:16.000
that's 11,000 kilometers across.

35:16.033 --> 35:17.867
Basically the size
of the entire Earth.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.433
- Really?
- So that we can take a picture

35:20.467 --> 35:22.193
of the black hole
at the center of our galaxy.

35:22.200 --> 35:26.100
Wow. South Pole
particularly useful because?

35:26.133 --> 35:27.667
There's no other site like this.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.467
The atmosphere is
extremely stable.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.200
It's extremely clear.
There's no water in it.

35:31.233 --> 35:33.067
Water absorbs the microwaves
we're looking at.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.300
So, you can just map the sky day

35:35.333 --> 35:37.000
and night for six months a year

35:37.033 --> 35:39.067
without stopping, and it
gives the best maps

35:39.100 --> 35:41.300
we can make, short
of going into space.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.000
I grew up in the Kennedy era

35:43.033 --> 35:44.600
where the Space Program
was everything.

35:44.633 --> 35:46.600
The first men on the moon,
the space race,

35:46.633 --> 35:50.000
the whole nation couldn't wait
'til we can get to Mars.

35:50.033 --> 35:51.400
Nobody gives a
[...] now.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.033
I mean, have you seen
that change?

35:53.067 --> 35:54.767
Because, I felt it change.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.533
Yeah. It's true that there
is an increased skepticism

35:58.567 --> 36:01.067
of objective reality these days,

36:01.100 --> 36:02.800
but this science stands

36:02.833 --> 36:07.267
on thousands of years
of human accrued understanding.

36:07.300 --> 36:10.433
Who's interested? Like,
who's most likely to benefit?

36:10.467 --> 36:13.333
There's no immediate answer
to that question.

36:13.367 --> 36:15.267
But you're asking
basic questions

36:15.300 --> 36:19.667
about the fundamental nature
of matter, time, space.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.867
Surely it was people asking
those kinds of questions

36:22.900 --> 36:25.100
that led directly
to technologies

36:25.133 --> 36:27.000
that we take for granted now.

36:27.033 --> 36:28.687
That's right.
I mean, there's no question.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.633
We have to solve hard problems
to do these things,

36:30.667 --> 36:33.400
and when we solve them
they have other applications.

36:33.433 --> 36:35.867
I've always thought
of this basic research...

36:35.900 --> 36:37.500
Trying to understand
the universe...

36:37.533 --> 36:40.733
As one of the most hopeful
things that humans do.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.033
We just want to know.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.233
What's at the other end of that?

36:45.267 --> 36:48.167
Wouldn't you kind of like
to know?

36:48.200 --> 36:51.333
At a time when science
is held in open contempt,

36:51.367 --> 36:53.167
when painfully-acquired data

36:53.200 --> 36:55.333
is actually being deleted
from computers

36:55.367 --> 36:58.067
if it conflicts with
preconceived policies,

36:58.100 --> 37:03.567
these guys are looking
at some deep stuff.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.633
Where do we come from?

37:05.667 --> 37:07.900
How does it all work?

37:07.933 --> 37:10.300
How far can we go?

37:10.333 --> 37:14.967
What are we as sentient
humans capable of?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.167
And what...

37:16.200 --> 37:18.067
What's on the other side?

37:20.700 --> 37:21.200
♪

37:52.800 --> 37:54.433
Chilly.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.000
My face hurts.

38:02.067 --> 38:04.900
It really is
the ass-end of the world.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.800
As the Antarctic summer season
comes to an end,

38:33.833 --> 38:37.200
the U.S. Coast Guard
icebreaker "Polar Star" cuts

38:37.233 --> 38:40.300
through 70 miles of frozen sea
to make a channel

38:40.333 --> 38:43.267
for the resupply
ship "Ocean Giant."

38:43.300 --> 38:45.900
She delivers vital food
and equipment to McMurdo

38:45.933 --> 38:47.900
before the winter closes in.

38:47.933 --> 38:50.867
Just over 500 containers
coming down

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600
and there'll be 500 going back.

38:52.633 --> 38:55.000
Well, just like a giant human.
Food comes in, shit goes out.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.900
Yep. Yeah.
The human waste does go out.

38:57.933 --> 38:59.333
Yeah. Everything, right?

38:59.367 --> 39:01.967
The retro,
the waste, old equipment.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.933
Dale Rivers, fleet ops foreman,

39:03.967 --> 39:07.100
makes sure the supplies
are moving on and off safely.

39:07.133 --> 39:10.300
The whole town mobilizes,
working alongside

39:10.333 --> 39:13.433
hundreds of Navy fleet ops
to unload and reload.

39:13.467 --> 39:15.333
Oh, yeah. That'll do.
Thank you.

39:15.367 --> 39:17.300
- You're welcome.
- Awesome.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.700
Russell Freeman is
the executive chef at McMurdo.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.967
- It's our year supply of food.
- Year supply?

39:22.000 --> 39:25.033
- Yep.
- How old is this?

39:25.067 --> 39:26.833
Ideally you would want it
from last year.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.333
We do a lot with a little.

39:28.367 --> 39:30.467
Yeah.
Soon after this vessel leaves,

39:30.500 --> 39:32.100
the population starts
just going downhill.

39:32.133 --> 39:33.600
- Right.
- Yeah.

39:33.633 --> 39:35.267
We're going to warm places.
Green grass.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.967
All the things you
don't see down here.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.847
- Children, puppies, and salads.
- Exactly. Yeah.

39:38.867 --> 39:42.700
And then we just scatter to the
winds and regroup in August.

39:42.733 --> 39:45.300
- Yeah.
- Will ya?

39:52.467 --> 39:54.967
At the end of the Antarctic
summer season

39:55.000 --> 39:58.633
there is, however,
a vibrant party culture.

39:58.667 --> 40:03.133
And where people work hard,
they deserve to party hard.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.200
Responsibly, of course.

40:04.233 --> 40:07.033
You got it. You got it.

40:07.067 --> 40:10.800
But they do go hardy.

40:10.833 --> 40:14.500
And whether it's the fuelies
or the wasties or the riggers

40:14.533 --> 40:17.333
who throw the best parties...
And there is much competition

40:17.367 --> 40:20.267
in this department...
One can, it turns out,

40:20.300 --> 40:24.033
have a very good time
at the end of the world.

40:33.067 --> 40:35.300
Let's get another album
queued up here.

40:38.067 --> 40:40.367
I'm liking this song.

40:42.367 --> 40:44.567
All right,
this is the world's worst

40:44.600 --> 40:48.767
and most technically-inept
DJ signing off.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.567
Thanks for listening.

41:05.333 --> 41:09.000
Antarctica... never gets old.

41:16.667 --> 41:20.167
There is a curiosity
in everyone who comes here.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.633
It's a continent of travelers...

41:22.667 --> 41:26.733
Of seekers united
in the continuation

41:26.767 --> 41:31.100
of exploration, learning,

41:31.133 --> 41:35.333
the search for greater
understanding...

41:35.367 --> 41:38.667
The pursuit of pure knowledge.
