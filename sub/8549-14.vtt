WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:05.373
OH, RICHIE,

00:05.439 --> 00:08.076
YOU'LL BE THE HIT
OF THE WINTER PAGEANT.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.678
YOU'RE THE CUTEST THING
IN WEBBED FEET.

00:10.744 --> 00:14.382
THEY MADE ME THE PENGUIN
BECAUSE I HAVE
THE BEST WADDLE.

00:15.883 --> 00:19.587
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.
YOU GET THAT
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.490
EXTRA, EXTRA.
READ ALL ABOUT IT!

00:22.556 --> 00:24.492
JUDY WINSLOW
GETS AN "A"
IN SPELLING.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.561
WAY TO GO!
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU STUDY.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.030
AND GET GROUNDED.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.965
MOM, LOOK AT MY TEST.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.435
JUST ONE SECOND.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:34.502 --> 00:38.372
GET A PLASTIC SURGEON.
WE NEED AN EMERGENCY
BEAK JOB.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.941
I GOT EXTRA CREDIT
FOR SPELLING
PLATYPUS RIGHT.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.111
HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.146
YEAH. OKAY.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.914
OH, YEAH.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.582
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.118

00:50.184 --> 00:52.720
NOW, WHAT WERE
YOU SAYING, JUDY?

00:55.923 --> 00:58.159
I have to go
to the bathroom.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.893
OH, RICHIE,
I TOLD YOU TO GO

00:59.960 --> 01:02.730
BEFORE YOU PUT
THE COSTUME ON.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.698
COME ON. OOP!

01:08.636 --> 01:12.540
KNEW I SHOULD'VE BUILT
A ZIPPER IN THAT THING.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.017
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:24.084 --> 01:25.553
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:25.619 --> 01:28.889

ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:28.956 --> 01:32.493
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:32.560 --> 01:36.964
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:37.030 --> 01:40.134
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:40.201 --> 01:44.338
* INSIDE THESE
GENTLE WALLS *

01:44.405 --> 01:47.808
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:47.875 --> 01:52.780
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:52.846 --> 01:55.816
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:55.883 --> 01:59.920
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:59.987 --> 02:02.723
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

02:02.790 --> 02:06.394
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

02:06.460 --> 02:09.863
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:09.930 --> 02:13.467
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

02:13.534 --> 02:16.704
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:17.838 --> 02:20.741
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:20.808 --> 02:24.678
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:43.030 --> 02:44.832
BRRR!

02:44.898 --> 02:47.501
THERE THEY ARE--
THE SNOW BUSTERS.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.903
IT'S A SNAP WHEN
YOU GOT THE TEAM

02:49.970 --> 02:52.373
OF WINSLOW
AND WINSLOW.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.008
DAD, LET'S JUMP
INTO THE 20th CENTURY

02:55.075 --> 02:56.644
AND BUY A SNOW BLOWER.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.647
NOW, WHY DO I NEED
A SNOW BLOWER

02:59.713 --> 03:02.182
WHEN I GOT YOU?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.017
NICE TRY, EDDIE.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.386
I'M OUT OF HERE.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.321
WHOA, NOT SO FAST.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.891
LET'S HIT
THE BOWLING ALLEY.
IT'S BURRITO NIGHT.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.127
NO CAN DO.
I'M HANGING OUT
WITH THE GUYS TONIGHT.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.629
OH, SOUNDS GOOD.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.298
OH, COUNT ME IN.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.234
WHAT'S THE SKINNY,
MINNIE?

03:22.102 --> 03:24.705
NO, DAD.
SEE, YOU CAN'T GO.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.942
MY FRIENDS
WILL MAKE FUN OF ME.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.279
THEY'LL CALL ME A DWEEB.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.982
NO, THEY WON'T.
I'M A COP.
I CARRY A GUN.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.017
DAD.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.553
ALRIGHT. GO AHEAD.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.489
THANKS.
SEE YOU LATER.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.024
WHEW! THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.759
SEE YOU, DAD.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.296
YOU KNOW, HARRIETTE,

03:48.362 --> 03:50.498
EVERY TIME I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING
WITH EDDIE,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.500
HE SAYS
HE'S TOO BUSY.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.135
OH. THERE'S A REASON
FOR THAT.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.838
OH? WHAT IS IT?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.440
YOU'RE OLD.

04:04.545 --> 04:08.316
YOU DIDN'T SAY
I WAS OLD LAST NIGHT.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.285
NO.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.754
YOU WENT TO SLEEP BEFORE
I COULD SAY ANYTHING.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.728
CARL, IF YOU WANT
TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH EDDIE,

04:20.794 --> 04:22.496
PLAN AHEAD.

04:22.563 --> 04:26.867
SCHEDULE A FATHER
AND SON OUTING.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.569
I KNOW
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.439
TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH EDDIE,
I'LL PLAN AHEAD.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.308
I'LL SCHEDULE
A FATHER
AND SON OUTING.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.677
ISN'T THAT
A GREAT IDEA?

04:56.263 --> 04:57.665
OH, LAURA?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.266
YEAH, MOM?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.569
I'M MISSING FOUR PAIRS
OF EDDIE'S SOCKS.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.974
DO YOU HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE THEY ARE?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.909
SEARCH ME.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.244
NO NEED.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.480
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.849
HOPEFULLY,
ABOUT A 38-D.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.119
HONEY, JUST LET NATURE
TAKE ITS COURSE.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.088
YOU'LL BLOSSOM
ANY DAY NOW.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.725
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL JUST WORK
ON MY BALANCE.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.261
HARRIETTE.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.898
WE'VE GOT TO TALK.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.135
KLEENEX?

05:35.202 --> 05:36.804
SOCKS.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.440
YOUR MOTHER
ONCE TRIED BEANBAGS.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.077
HARRIETTE,
I JUST CAUGHT JUDY

05:44.144 --> 05:46.914
RIPPING THE BEAK OFF
RICHIE'S PENGUIN COSTUME.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.517
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO THAT CHILD.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.885
HAS HER HEAD BEEN
SPINNING AROUND?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.723
JUDY'S PROBABLY JEALOUS.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.857
OF WHAT?

05:56.924 --> 05:59.993
SHE'S NOT THE BABY
OF THE HOUSE ANYMORE.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.863
BUT DON'T WORRY.
SAME THING
HAPPENED TO ME.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.333
AND LOOK HOW GREAT
I TURNED OUT.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.869
YOU WERE
ACTUALLY JEALOUS
OF AUNT RACHEL?

06:14.007 --> 06:16.944
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I WAS A STUNNING BABY.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.345
PEOPLE CAME
FROM MILES AROUND

06:18.412 --> 06:20.914
JUST TO COOCHY-COO ME.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
THEY STILL DO.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.217
OH, GIVE IT A REST.

06:24.284 --> 06:27.655
COME ON, YOU KNOW
WHEN I WAS BORN,
MAMA WEPT FOR JOY.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.390
WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
SHE JUST WEPT.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.162
KEEP IT UP,
AND I'LL BURY YOUR
BARBIE DOLL AGAIN.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.264
OHH!

06:37.330 --> 06:39.332
OKAY, OKAY. BUT WHAT
ARE WE GOING TO DO

06:39.399 --> 06:41.268
ABOUT THESE
FEUDING COUSINS?

06:41.334 --> 06:43.403
WELL, LET'S JUST
LET JUDY AND RICHIE

06:43.471 --> 06:46.974
WORK IT OUT
FOR THEMSELVES,
LIKE WE DID.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.509
HI, GANG.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.782
LAURA!

06:56.049 --> 06:57.150
OH...

06:57.217 --> 06:58.652

06:59.119 --> 07:00.988
BOSOMS!

07:05.058 --> 07:06.494
OHH!

07:14.167 --> 07:15.368
HEY, STEVE,
WHAT'S UP?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.938
MY BLOOD PRESSURE.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.842
A FEW MINUTES AGO,
I SAW LAURA AND FAINTED.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.843
WHY?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.344
WHY?

07:24.411 --> 07:28.015
WELL, GOOD LORD, MAN,
SHE'S AN OVERNIGHT
SUCCESS STORY.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.087
WHY, SHE IS WOMAN,
HEAR ME ROAR.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.694
HEY, WHAT'S

07:42.663 --> 07:45.032
HEY, DAD.
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

07:45.098 --> 07:48.702
THE FINEST
FISHING EQUIPMENT
YOU CAN BUY ON SALE.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.840
REMEMBER YOU WANTING
TO FISH LAST SUMMER?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.643
WELL, THIS SATURDAY,
IT'S YOU AND ME, SON.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.410
UH, NEWS FLASH, DAD--

07:57.477 --> 07:58.746
IT'S JANUARY.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.813
I KNOW.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.114
WE'RE GOING
ICE FISHING.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.651
OOH,

COMFY CHAIRS.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.862
THOSE FISH WILL BE
SWIMMING IN TARTAR
SAUCE IN NO TIME.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.733
UH...DAD,
I REALLY DON'T THINK

08:19.800 --> 08:22.169
THAT I'M AN ICE FISHING
KIND OF GUY.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.071
OH, YOU'LL LOVE IT.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.307
JACK AT THE PRECINCT
AND HIS SON DANNY
GO ALL THE TIME.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.142
DANNY WASN'T INTO IT
AT FIRST,

08:29.209 --> 08:31.278
BUT NOW HE'S HOOKED.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.780
HOOKED...FISHING--

08:32.846 --> 08:35.783
BODACIOUS PUN,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.386
WELL, IF WE'RE
GOING ICE FISHING,

08:39.452 --> 08:41.421
I HAVE TO STOCK UP
ON LIP BALM.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.157
STEVE. STEVE.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.661
I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.998
THIS TRIP IS JUST
FOR EDWARD AND ME.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.332
ALONE.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.234
BY OURSELVES.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.103
ALONE.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.305
JUST THE TWO OF US.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.074
ALONE?

09:03.644 --> 09:06.647
ARE YOU SAYING
I'M NOT INVITED?

09:08.415 --> 09:11.084
A-HA HA HA HA!

09:11.151 --> 09:13.486
BOY, YOU REALLY HAD ME
GOING THERE, CARL,

09:13.553 --> 09:16.123
YOU CRAZY KIDDER, YOU.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.794
STEVE,
I'M NOT JOKING.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.331
A-HA HA HA HA!

09:25.565 --> 09:28.235

09:31.705 --> 09:32.973

09:33.540 --> 09:35.943
HAAAA HA HA!

09:41.181 --> 09:43.116
ANYWAY, JACK SAID

09:43.183 --> 09:45.719
THE PERFECT SPOT
FOR FISHING
IS LAKE WANNAMUCK.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.521
HE SAID
THE RAINBOW TROUT
ARE REALLY BITING.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.358
UH, DAD, UH...

09:51.424 --> 09:54.527
I THINK I'M GOING TO PASS.
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.764
OH, I DO. I DO, SON,
BUT, HEY...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.502
I SPENT 150 BUCKS
FOR THIS STUFF.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.271
YOU'RE GOING.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.385
DAD, WE'VE BEEN WALKING
FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.020
WHEN DO WE STOP?

10:20.087 --> 10:20.954
I AM LOOKING...

10:21.021 --> 10:21.689
[PANTING]

10:21.755 --> 10:24.091
FOR THE PERFECT SPOT...

10:24.157 --> 10:25.926
AND HERE IT IS.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.933
WELL, EDDIE,
HERE SHE IS...

10:33.000 --> 10:37.204
LAKE WANNAMUCK
IN ALL HER GLORY.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.272
ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.774
SHE'S FRIGID.

10:42.509 --> 10:45.378
LISTEN, LISTEN,
EDWARD...

10:45.445 --> 10:47.347
WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

10:52.519 --> 10:53.386
NOTHING.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.555
EXACTLY--
NO CAR HORNS,

10:55.622 --> 10:58.158
NO FACTORY WHISTLES,
NO SIRENS.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.127
OUT HERE, WE ARE
TOTALLY ISOLATED

11:00.193 --> 11:03.263
FROM EVERY LOUD,
OBNOXIOUS SOUND.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.765
HI, GUYS!

11:11.739 --> 11:14.708
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SLOW-POKES SHOWED UP.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.987
STEVE, HOW DID
YOU GET HERE?

11:27.054 --> 11:28.889
WELL, MY MOM SAYS
THERE WAS A STORK.

11:28.956 --> 11:33.126
BUT I'VE SEEN THE CONTRACT
FROM THE IN VITRO
FERTILIZATION CLINIC.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.932
STEVE, I MEANT,
HOW DID YOU GET UP HERE?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.035
OH, WELL, LET'S SEE.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.671
I TOOK THE 12:10 BUS
TO LAKE BLUFF.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.573
I HAD A PRIMO PECAN ROLL.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.475
I MISSED THE 2:45 BUS

11:48.541 --> 11:51.845
AND THEN I HITCHED A RIDE
WITH AN ARMLESS TEAMSTER
NAMED MABLE.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.848
NO ARMS?
HOW DID SHE SHIFT?

11:54.915 --> 11:58.285
YOU KNOW, I SAW IT AND I STILL
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.224
HERE WE ARE,
THE THREE AMIGOS--

12:04.291 --> 12:07.260
CARLOS, EDUARDOS,
AND...STEVOS.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.398
I'M HAVING
A MUCHO GRANDE TIME, GUYS.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.400
I'M F-FREEZING.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.835
NOT MOI.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.970
I BOUGHT A PAIR
OF ELECTRIC LONG JOHNS.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.507
I'M TOASTY WARM IN THESE
UL-APPROVED BABIES.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.775
IF THE TEMPERATURE DIPS,

12:21.842 --> 12:24.011
I JUST HIT THE OLD
SWITCHEROONIE,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.980
AND IN NO TIME FLAT,
I'M A HUMAN BUN-WARMER.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.617
OH! OH!

12:30.683 --> 12:31.318
OH! OH!

12:31.384 --> 12:32.719
AAH! AAH!

12:32.786 --> 12:33.954
AAH!

12:34.021 --> 12:36.790
OH, BOY! OH, BOY!

12:36.857 --> 12:39.893
STEVE!
WHOA, MAMA!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.796
OH! OH! OH! OH!

12:42.863 --> 12:44.164
STEVE, ARE YOU OKAY?

12:44.231 --> 12:45.765
OH! OH! OH! OH!

12:45.833 --> 12:49.937
OH! OH! OH! OH!

AHH.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.154
ARE YOU THROUGH.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.556
ALMOST.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.391
AHH.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.761
OH.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.863
OH, BOY.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.497
OHH, BOY!

13:17.564 --> 13:18.966
OH!

13:19.032 --> 13:22.469
SO, WHAT KIND OF BAIT
YOU FELLOWS USING?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.736
WORMS.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.339
I'M USING CHEESE.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.445
YOU WANT TO TRY SOME?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.413
NO.
NO, THANKS.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.982
YOU'LL CATCH MORE FISH.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.018
STEVE, YOU USE THE BAIT
THAT YOU WANT,

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
AND WE'LL USE THE BAIT
THAT WE WANT.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.321
YEAH.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.858
AND WE'LL JUST SEE WHO
CATCHES THE FIRST FISH.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.429
AND THEN WHAT?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.943
LADIES AND...

14:03.743 --> 14:05.712
LADIES.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.714
PRESENTING,
DIRECT FROM THE ARCTIC,

14:07.780 --> 14:09.950
THE STAR OF
THE WINTER PAGEANT,

14:10.017 --> 14:13.120
RICHIE "THE PENGUIN"
CRAWFORD.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.126
HOW'S MY WADDLE, MOM?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.728
OH, HONEY,
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.897
YOU JUST NEED
MORE TAIL ACTION.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.765
WATCH MOMMY.
WALK THIS WAY.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.368
FIRST YOU WADDLE,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.870
THEN WIGGLE.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.572
WADDLE.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.607
WIGGLE.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.443
WADDLE.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.345
WIGGLE.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.213
ISN'T HE CUTE?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.248
NO.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.485
JUDY, DO YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH RICHIE?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.121
YES. HE WAS BORN.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.057
WHY, THAT LITTLE BUM.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.426
LET'S LOCK HIM UP
AND THROW AWAY THE KEY.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.264
LAURA, EVERYBODY MAKES
A BIG FUSS OVER RICHIE,

14:57.330 --> 15:01.234
AND I GET IGNORED,
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.671
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REMEMBER THAT FEELING.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.805
YOU DO?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.007
YEAH. WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.508
YOU GOT ALL THE ATTENTION
I USED TO GET.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.011
I WAS WILLING TO DO
ANYTHING TO YOU
TO GET ATTENTION.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.145
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.847
OH, GOOD.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.183
COME ON. TELL ME.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.086
I DUMPED ALL MY TOYS
IN YOUR CRIB.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.021
SO I'D HAVE TOYS
TO PLAY WITH?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.223
I WAS TRYING TO BURY YOU.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.495
THEN I REALIZED
THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES
TO NOT BEING THE BABY.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.231
YOU CAN STAY UP LATER,
AND CHOSE YOUR OWN CLOTHES.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.699
AND YOU KNOW
THE BEST PART?

15:32.765 --> 15:33.933
WHAT?

15:34.001 --> 15:36.936
YOU HAVE A LITTLE KID
WHO LOOKS UP TO YOU.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.207
YEAH. I NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.542
YOU GO APOLOGIZE
TO RICHIE.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.044
OKAY.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.950
* FISHING ON
LAKE WANNAMUCK,
DOO-DAH! DOO-DAH! *

15:51.018 --> 15:53.653
* SEEMS I'M HAVING
ALL THE LUCK
ALL THE DOO-DAH DAY *

15:53.720 --> 15:54.654
STEVE.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.855
* HAVING ALL THE LUCK-- *

15:55.922 --> 15:57.324
STEVE.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.725
STEVE!

15:59.492 --> 16:00.627
HMM?

16:00.693 --> 16:03.096
THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN NOT CATCHING FISH

16:03.163 --> 16:05.498
IS YOU
SINGING ABOUT IT.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.135
HA HA HA!

16:08.201 --> 16:10.470
DAD, WHEN ARE
WE LEAVING?

16:10.537 --> 16:11.938
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.806
WE'RE HAVING FUN HERE.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.243
OH, REALLY?
WHY WASN'T I TOLD?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.747
ARE YOU IMPLYING
YOU'RE HAVING A BAD TIME?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.315
DAD, I'M NOT
IMPLYING.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.617
I'M TELLING IT
STRAIGHT OUT.
I HATE THIS!

16:26.953 --> 16:28.221
WHY?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.690
FOR ONE THING,
I CAN'T FEEL MY TOES!

16:30.757 --> 16:32.659
UH-OH.
MR. FROSTBITE.

16:32.725 --> 16:36.096
OH, WHEN HE SHOWS UP,
IT'S AMPUTATION TIME.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.531
OH, GREAT.
I'M GOING
TO LOSE MY TOES.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.301
THE GOOD NEWS IS
MY DAD WILL DO
THE OPERATION FOR YOU,

16:41.368 --> 16:45.672
BAD NEWS IS
HE'LL CHARGE YOU
AN ARM AND A LEG.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.210
EDWARD, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO LOSE YOUR TOES.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.146
TAKE SOME ADVICE
FROM ME. THINK WARM.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.116
NO OFFENSE, DAD,

16:56.183 --> 16:59.919
BUT WHAT
I'D REALLY LIKE
IS TO GO HOME.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.056
OKAY, THIS TRIP IS OVER.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.526
EDDO.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.995
I LOVE YOU FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART,

17:09.062 --> 17:11.564
BUT YOU ARE
ONE BIG WUSS.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.103
OKAY. THAT'S IT.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.740
HEY, HEY, HEY!
CUT IT OUT, YOU TWO!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.642
CUT IT OUT!

17:23.876 --> 17:25.678
[CREAKING]

17:29.849 --> 17:31.551
DON'T MOVE.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.488
MAYBE WE BETTER MOVE.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.423
[CREAK]

17:36.489 --> 17:38.425
DON'T MOVE.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.828
UH, YOU MOVE.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.197
WHY?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.399
STEVE, THE ICE IS WEAK HERE.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.201
THE LIGHTEST PERSON
SHOULD GO FIRST.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.870
ONCE YOU'RE SAFE,
EDDIE GOES.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.472
WELL...

17:52.539 --> 17:54.674
OKAY.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.564
OKAY. ALRIGHT,
EDWARD. YOU'RE NEXT.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.782
OKAY. ALRIGHT.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.452
EASY, CARL.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.120
EASY.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.257
AAH! OH, NO! OH!

18:45.024 --> 18:46.426
HANG ON, BIG GUY!

18:46.493 --> 18:47.960
DAD!

18:48.027 --> 18:49.496
OH, MY GOD!

18:50.563 --> 18:53.766
WE'LL SAVE YOU!
HOLD ON! HOLD ON!

18:58.004 --> 19:00.139
I CAN'T PULL MYSELF UP!

19:01.374 --> 19:03.476
WE HAVE TO MAKE
A HUMAN CHAIN.
I'LL GO FIRST.

19:03.543 --> 19:07.614
NO, I'M THE LIGHTEST.
LET ME.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.082
OKAY, STEVE.
HOLD THE ROPE
AND SLIDE OUT.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.718
STAY BACK, GUYS!
STAY BACK!

19:11.784 --> 19:13.220
WAIT.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.890
FASTER, STEVE.
HURRY UP!

19:17.957 --> 19:20.560
I--I GOT HIM!
I GOT HIM!

19:20.627 --> 19:23.396
PULL! PULL!

19:33.440 --> 19:35.242
DAD?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.845
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.848
OH, YEAH.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.793
NOW, TELL ME IF
THIS WATER IS TOO HOT.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.796
OH, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TOO HOT.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.198
IT'S COLD, B-B-BABY.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.301
OH, CARL.
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.635
HURRY, HARRIETTE.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.273
OH, HURRY, HARRI--
HURRY, HARRIETTE.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.780
DOES THIS HELP?

20:13.846 --> 20:14.781
A LITTLE.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.916
I JUST CAN'T GET WARM.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.419
HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.592
OOH. OPEN A WINDOW.
IT'S HOT IN HERE.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.365
HERE YOU GO, DAD.
BROUGHT YOU
SOME HOT COCOA.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.867
JUST THE WAY
YOU LIKE IT--
19 MARSHMALLOWS.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.305
THANKS, SON.

20:38.371 --> 20:42.675
UH, MOM,
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE
ALONE WITH DAD?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.711
SURE.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.651
IF YOU GET ANOTHER CHILL,
THESE LIPS WON'T BE FAR.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.791
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, SON?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.295
DAD,
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.031
WHY DID YOU DRAG ME
TO THAT LAKE TODAY?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.700
WHY THE FATHER
AND SON KICK?

21:07.767 --> 21:11.538
ARE YOU HAVING
A MIDLIFE CRISIS?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.973
NO.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.377
I GUESS I'M TRYING TO
MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.978
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:19.045 --> 21:22.549
WELL, WHEN YOU
WERE LITTLE,

21:22.615 --> 21:25.852
YOU USED TO
ALWAYS ASK ME
TO DO THINGS WITH YOU,

21:25.918 --> 21:29.322
BUT I WAS TOO BUSY
TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.893
WELL, NOW YOU'RE OLDER,
I HAVE THE TIME,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.563
BUT NOW
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BUSY.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.300
WELL, FROM NOW ON, DAD,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.870
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO
SPEND TIME TOGETHER,

21:43.936 --> 21:45.972
JUST SAY THE WORD.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.174
REALLY?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.308
WOW.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.144
THAT WOULD BE
GREAT, SON.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.647
WHY THE SUDDEN
CHANGE OF HEART?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.850
WELL, DAD...

22:00.987 --> 22:04.123
I ALMOST LOST YOU TODAY.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.793
IT REALLY SCARED ME.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.629
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT SCARED ME, TOO.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.499
LOOK, DAD,

22:12.565 --> 22:14.200
I WANT US TO DO LOTS
OF THINGS TOGETHER,

22:14.266 --> 22:16.669
BUT LET'S NEVER GO
ICE FISHING AGAIN.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.373
DEAL?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.343
DEAL.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.313
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.516
I LOVE YOU, TOO, SON.
