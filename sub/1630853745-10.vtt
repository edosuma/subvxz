WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:07.173
I’m so excited to see who’s
the new charter guests.

00:07.215 --> 00:09.175
-I’m Kyle, nice to meet you.
-Hi, Kyle.

00:09.217 --> 00:12.804
I see this tall man,
beautiful smile.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.974
I never thought
I would honestly be so attracted

00:16.016 --> 00:17.517
to another individual.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.228
They need to be careful, because
if the captain finds out,

00:20.270 --> 00:22.605
he could lose his job over this.

00:22.647 --> 00:23.648
Aw.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.817
I am making Storm bosun.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.569
-Yay!
-Yeah!

00:27.610 --> 00:30.363
I still think this is like
some sort of crazy dream.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.406
Jason.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.991
-Jason!
-[whistles]

00:33.033 --> 00:34.701
Flat-out ignoring me.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.328
Just feels like Jason doesn’t
actually really want to be here.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.456
Where the [bleep] is Jason?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.292
But if you’re gonna work
on a yacht...

00:43.752 --> 00:45.754
Ugh, mate, this sh-- annoys
the sh-- outta me.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.051
My boyfriend’s having
issues with me

00:51.092 --> 00:52.802
continuing to work with Dave.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.429
I don’t want what
I’m supposed to do.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.556
We obviously know
there’s nothing

00:56.598 --> 00:58.391
that’s gonna happen
between us now.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.310
Which is fine, I’m a big boy.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.479
But I still think
you’re an amazing person.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.189
I’m sorry, Davey.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.607
You’re all right.

01:05.648 --> 01:06.733
Yeowww!

01:06.775 --> 01:08.401
Please, can we have
a lot of alcohol?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.986
Yay!

01:10.028 --> 01:11.446
[shouting, laughing]

01:16.785 --> 01:20.246
I waited a long time to
have a moment like this.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.874
Frank!
I love you!

01:22.916 --> 01:25.669
[screaming]

01:50.318 --> 01:51.820
[alarm sounds]

01:53.655 --> 01:55.740
Mmm.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.174
Twenty-seven knots of wind.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.218
That concerns me.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.352
Why?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.734
Missed you, missed you,
missed you.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.446
If I could turn back time
with Frank right now,

02:34.487 --> 02:35.989
I’d be riding him like a pony.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.991
[laughing]

02:38.033 --> 02:39.367
Looking like a superstar.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.202
Feel like a new man.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.959
<i>Storm, Dave, and Natasha,</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:50.045
<i>meet in the crew mess for</i>
<i>a preference sheet meeting.</i>

02:50.086 --> 02:52.881
<i>-Copy.</i>
<i>-Copy.</i>

02:52.922 --> 02:54.090
-Hey.
-Hi.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.675
Okay. Charter number five.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.510
Lisa Moore and her daughter,
Shelby, have been looking

02:57.552 --> 02:59.679
to plan a fabulous getaway
for themselves

02:59.721 --> 03:01.681
and some of Shelby’s
childhood friends.

03:01.723 --> 03:05.268
Favorite cuisines, elevated
Californian, Mediterranean...

03:05.310 --> 03:07.395
-What’s "elevated Californian?"
-Tacos.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.064
-Sushi?
-Sushi, yeah.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.859
Guests request low-carb lunch
options, such as large salads.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.612
Dinner tapas with
several small-plate dishes.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.113
So, for the morning
they requested

03:17.155 --> 03:18.531
the surf-yoga sessions.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
So, we’ll obviously have
a look at the wind

03:19.949 --> 03:21.326
and see if it’s doable.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.286
If it’s not, we can just
get them on the sundeck,

03:23.328 --> 03:24.496
but hopefully get them
in the water.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.622
Mm-hmm.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.290
I’ll get all the boards
out and ready.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.459
Now that I’m bosun, there’s
a level of consequences,

03:29.501 --> 03:30.919
there’s a level of achievements,

03:30.960 --> 03:32.629
there’s everything
that comes in between.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.881
I just really enjoy pressure,
so I need to learn

03:34.923 --> 03:36.591
how to trust people
and do things,

03:36.633 --> 03:38.385
but also now I’ve got
everything to lose,

03:38.426 --> 03:40.720
because if something goes wrong,
it’ll be on me.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.973
So, they want a couple
of beach set-ups.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.892
Day one, happy hour on shore,

03:45.934 --> 03:49.354
then dinner, to go in
with a ’70s party.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.106
That’s cool.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.733
Day two, another beach set-up.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.194
Shelby’s hoping to
celebrate recent birthdays

03:56.236 --> 03:58.279
with Guy’s and Dolly’s party,

03:58.321 --> 04:00.532
dressing up as Guy Fieri
and Dolly Parton,

04:00.573 --> 04:02.575
their favorite celebrities.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.786
So, the guests are
arriving via water taxi,

04:04.828 --> 04:06.413
and that’s a 12:00 arrival.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.289
-Thanks, Cap.
-Thank you.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.670
Ugh, that made me
feel sick right now.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.296
Blegh, imagine eating
a scallop right now.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.715
-Scallops.
-Imagine it.

04:16.756 --> 04:17.716
Tease me.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.925
-Does it make you feel sick?
-No.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.010
A scallop in the morning.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.261
I could eat a scallop
in the morning.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.013
You’re a scallop in the morning.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.848
I love actually being on a team,

04:24.889 --> 04:27.475
but after the second charter,
I started realizing

04:27.517 --> 04:29.811
that oh [bleep] people
knowing each other,

04:29.853 --> 04:31.813
that’s actually not
really a good thing.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.149
I’m like a lone wolf on, like...

04:34.190 --> 04:36.568
honestly, I kinda miss Raygan.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.780
I’ll act like you
didn’t say that.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.033
It’s crazy.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.284
Yeah, they are, hey?

04:44.325 --> 04:46.911
Or are creatures or
are they fish?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.663
Is an octopus a fish,
or is it a creature?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.418
I used to do this with
a girl

04:53.460 --> 04:56.129
that I used to work
with in the morning.

04:56.171 --> 05:01.676
We used to say three things
that we are grateful for today.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.511
What are your three
things today?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.722
I’m grateful for my chief stew.

05:05.764 --> 05:06.514
Ah!

05:06.556 --> 05:09.017
I’m grateful... eh?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.352
You’re such a fibber.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.644
I’m not.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.690
It definitely paid off,

05:15.732 --> 05:17.150
not going out with
the rest of the crew.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.611
Going to beer bar?

05:19.652 --> 05:23.782
They feel like sh--, I feel like
stars, roses, and sunshine.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.160
It’s so good not having
any hangover guilt.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.661
It was the right thing to do.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.663
I’m grateful for my six hours’
sleep I had.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.165
It’s better than three.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.834
All crew, all crew,
we will be departing the dock

05:34.876 --> 05:36.378
at 1100 hours.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.879
Does that mean the
guests are coming...

05:37.921 --> 05:40.173
The guests will board
us on anchor,

05:40.215 --> 05:42.175
due to potential weather.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.635
Okay, copy.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.136
We have a charter
boarding today.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.930
I know the weather’s gonna
change by the time

05:46.971 --> 05:48.723
the guests’ arrival,
and we have a window

05:48.765 --> 05:51.017
to get out to sea and around
the corner for protection.

05:51.059 --> 05:51.893
I’m gonna take it.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.561
I’m not gonna take the risk,

05:53.603 --> 05:55.438
because I don’t wanna
be stuck at the dock.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.030
Drop-off day is...

06:04.072 --> 06:04.864
Friday.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.866
Mzi’s birthday is Friday.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.077
All crew, all crew, we have
provisions on the dock.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.745
<i>Copy, coming.</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:13.790
Tash, I need you to make slow
movements today, nothing fast.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.166
[laughs]

06:17.419 --> 06:19.421
No, you sick [bleep].

06:28.638 --> 06:30.140
Jesus Christ.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.560
What the hell, we already
have so much of all this.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.400
So stressed, like,
I’m considering having

06:40.442 --> 06:41.609
a Diet Coke at this time
in the morning.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.654
Ugh, it’s so full everywhere.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.531
They don’t fit in
the ----ing fridges.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.626
Tash is the worst provisioner
I’ve ever worked with.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.756
Oh, my God.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.674
What?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.638
It’s not that hard to
look and be, like,

07:10.680 --> 07:12.098
there is room for
five orange juices.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.059
We could literally drop
a bottle of orange juice

07:14.100 --> 07:15.977
to every doorstep in
Australia right now,

07:16.019 --> 07:17.979
and that’d still be too much.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.113
Oh, my God,
even the boat’s pissed off.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.283
Coming up...

07:30.325 --> 07:31.785
Oh, my God.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.869
Who was polishing down here?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.329
I think Jason was polishing.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.790
[bleep] Jay, if I ask you to
do this polishing, dude,

07:36.831 --> 07:38.583
you have to take notice,
you know?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.126
This is not polished,
this is not polished.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.718
Really enjoying
the organization of this.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.684
Stop it.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.687
All crew, all crew,
get ready for departure.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.689
Okay, when she tells
us to single up,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.148
then you’ll do the main springs.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.233
Yep.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.485
Storm, Storm,
single up on your lines.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.945
Copy that.
Okay, Court.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.157
Ah, bitch!

08:11.199 --> 08:12.701
All stern lines are in.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.120
<i>Okay, you can bring those</i>
<i>lines in on the bow.</i>

08:21.418 --> 08:23.128
<i>All bow lines are in,</i>
<i>bow lines are in.</i>

08:23.169 --> 08:24.629
Let me know when
it’s clear to swing.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.089
Ready on the stern.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.592
<i>Six meters off</i>
<i>your port bow to V4.</i>

08:29.634 --> 08:30.760
<i>Two meters off V4.</i>

08:30.802 --> 08:33.263
Kick to starboard.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.558
Stern is clear, you
are clear to swing.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.560
Good job, Court.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.228
Thanks, dude.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.688
Now he’s getting it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.241
-Good job.
-Thanks, Cap.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.961
-Know what I mean?
-Copy.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.963
Because our guests are
arriving by tender.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.889
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.515
<i>Storm, Storm, Sandy.</i>

09:17.557 --> 09:18.933
Can you meet me in the bridge?

09:18.975 --> 09:19.934
Copy.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.644
-Just provisional--
-[feedback]

09:21.686 --> 09:23.146
Stop, Mzi!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.858
These all have food on them.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.234
We’re dropping two anchors.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.778
All right, that would be
the first time for me,

09:29.819 --> 09:30.779
-I’ve never done that before.
-Okay.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.155
It’ll be good practice.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.115
If you have any pointers,
just let me know.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.742
Yeah, sure, so I’ll drop one,
we’ll come out on two shackles.

09:35.784 --> 09:36.951
I’m gonna mark it on the chart,
where I drop it.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.536
-Okay, okay.
-Because we want a V.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.039
The pros of dropping two anchors
is you’re not gonna drag

09:41.081 --> 09:43.792
and end up on the rocks
or someone else’s boat.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.127
The cons are when
the wind drops,

09:46.169 --> 09:48.004
the boat could swing around
and we tangle the anchor.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.256
There might be a kink
in the anchor chain.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.759
Or it’s twisted on
the other one.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.641
It happens to every
captain every season,

09:59.683 --> 10:01.976
and that could happen here.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.396
So, I wanna make sure that
they’re on top of it.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.147
All right, thanks, Cap.

10:06.189 --> 10:10.652
We’re gonna drop two anchors.
We have to be very vigilant.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.153
Yeah.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.488
If the wind decreases,
one shackle must come up.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.907
You need to just find
your bearings, so...

10:15.949 --> 10:16.991
Yeah, and keep...

10:17.033 --> 10:17.992
...where the wind’s coming from,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.452
if the boat starts doing this,

10:19.494 --> 10:20.662
you need to either
wake me up or wake Sandy up.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.330
Yeah.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.290
We’ll be dropping the starboard
first, and then the port.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.168
Copy that, Captain,
we’re ready for you.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.546
Don’t pull up, try...
just pull completely parallel...

10:29.587 --> 10:31.297
there you go.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.382
Starboard anchor down.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.471
Okay, lock it off,
lock it off.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.806
Two shackles in the water,

10:39.848 --> 10:41.558
two shackles in the water
on starboard.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.726
Drop the port anchor.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.144
Drop, drop, drop.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.023
Chain going down.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.024
Okay, lock it off.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.650
Does it look like a "V?"

10:50.692 --> 10:53.153
Captain, I can see the V from
here, I can see the V from here.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.198
Okay, thanks, you guys
did an excellent job.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.742
Let’s move this crew tender.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.577
Yep.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.786
-Would you like to?
-Yeah.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.371
I think when I was just
a deckhand,

11:03.413 --> 11:05.457
I still had a mentality of,
like, trying to strive

11:05.498 --> 11:06.458
to be the best on my team.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.084
That was just my upbringing,

11:08.126 --> 11:10.253
that I was just brought up in
a very competitive environment.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.089
It makes things a little bit
more trickier to trust people,

11:13.131 --> 11:15.258
but at the same time,
I think that’s

11:15.300 --> 11:17.218
what you need to learn
as a bosun.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.970
Okay, you need to come align.

11:19.012 --> 11:19.971
I am, yeah, sorry,
it’s the wind.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.431
That’s all right.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.266
Do you feel more comfortable
to just come in, rather?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.226
That’s all right,
just two secs.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.103
I would like to do everything,

11:27.145 --> 11:28.938
but that wouldn’t make me
a good leader.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.106
Is that all right?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.775
Yeah, that’s fine.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.443
Okay, you can go get
changed, Courts.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.694
Yeah, thank you.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.821
All crew, all crew,
in your whites.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.491
Guest arrival at 12:00.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.658
Thank you.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.119
Still gotta do my walkaround.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.590
Come on, everyone just gets
snapped out of it.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.093
-We need to... yeah.
-Number five, baby, number five.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.929
It’s hump day, hump day,
downhill from here, sunshine.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.431
You are way too positive,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.767
and that irritates me even more
when I’m trying to be sad.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.770
[laughing]

12:08.812 --> 12:11.815
Hit the doors, everything
that the guests will see.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.693
----ing hell.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.361
The [bleep] is this?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.946
Mm.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.906
Oh, my God.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.120
Hey, who was
polishing down here?

12:25.161 --> 12:26.538
I think Jason was polishing.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.416
[bleep]

12:29.457 --> 12:33.169
Why do 50 percent
of the ----ing job?

12:33.211 --> 12:36.006
<i>Jason, can you please meet</i>
<i>me at the swim platform?</i>

12:38.633 --> 12:40.301
-Is that them?
-No.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.262
Jay, if I ask you to do
this polishing, dude,

12:42.303 --> 12:43.888
you have to take notice,
you know,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.640
that the boat’s gonna come here.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.517
This is not polished,
this is not polished.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.144
None of it’s polished,
I didn’t get to it.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.520
-I asked to go from...
-I did the starboard...

12:50.562 --> 12:52.647
where the gates are gonna
be first,

12:52.689 --> 12:54.607
so if you’re at ocean,
if you’re at sea,

12:54.649 --> 12:56.276
where do you think
they’re gonna come from?

12:58.403 --> 13:01.906
Jason doesn’t know the way
that yachting is meant to go,

13:01.948 --> 13:03.950
and he’s, like, 35.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.661
It kinda makes sense, because
obviously he’s been quite slow

13:06.703 --> 13:08.329
with everything else,
so I can understand why

13:08.371 --> 13:11.791
it’s taking him longer
than 35 years to, like,

13:11.833 --> 13:13.335
learn how to not be a dick.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.012
All crew, all crew, to the
aft deck for guest arrival.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.476
Alexa, how do I walk
on these rocks?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.144
Are you okay,
do you want a hand?

13:31.186 --> 13:32.604
No, I think I’m good,
I have good balance.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.606
-Okay.
-Wow!

13:38.360 --> 13:41.738
The hardest part about being
in a long-distance relationship

13:41.780 --> 13:46.576
on boats is that you just
don’t have enough time

13:46.618 --> 13:49.662
to keep in touch with
the person that you’re with.

13:49.704 --> 13:52.248
People have stuff going on back
home all the time,

13:52.290 --> 13:55.293
whether it’s, like, a baby
being born or a wedding.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.046
My granddad was
a yachtie himself,

13:58.088 --> 14:01.132
and he worked
on the queen’s boat,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.884
on the Royal Yacht Britannia.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.345
He worked six months on,
six months off,

14:05.387 --> 14:08.932
and he was one of
the 250 crewmembers

14:08.973 --> 14:11.184
only that ever served
on that yacht.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.270
He actually wasn’t there
when my dad was born.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.772
My dad’s a twin.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.273
I relate 100 percent.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.276
I think it comes from my
grandma, as to the way I am.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.779
Being in this industry
makes you realize

14:22.821 --> 14:26.116
it’s such a hard thing
to do and to juggle.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.285
Let’s do the wave.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.414
-Yes!
-Whoa!

14:32.455 --> 14:33.748
Ready?
Here’s the skinny.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.375
Yes, Cap?

14:35.417 --> 14:36.960
I’m gonna stand here, you
guys are gonna line up here.

14:37.002 --> 14:40.463
Woo!

14:40.505 --> 14:42.924
You literally stink like a
bottle of champagne.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.093
That’s my cologne.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.807
Natasha, come down, come down.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.643
We are sh--ting our pants.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.438
[laughing]

14:56.479 --> 14:59.441
-Hi!
-Hi!

14:59.482 --> 15:00.316
Thank you.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.317
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.569
-Whoa.
-Hi, welcome.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.029
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Welcome aboard.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.363
Hi, I’m David, nice to meet you.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.865
I’m Natasha,
lovely to meet you.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.074
Hi!

15:08.116 --> 15:09.534
-There we go, good job.
-Thank you.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.994
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.829
-Welcome aboard.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.622
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:14.664 --> 15:15.749
This is nice.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.917
What a way to arrive
on a yacht, right?

15:17.959 --> 15:19.627
Yeah!

15:19.669 --> 15:23.089
Natasha’s our chief stew.
She’s gonna show you around.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.674
-Thank you very much.
-You’re so welcome.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.009
Thank you.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.302
Just to start of classy
and end up messy later.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.803
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.348
-Cheers, ladies!
-Woo!

15:31.389 --> 15:33.683
-Would you like a little tour?
-Yeah!

15:33.725 --> 15:36.311
Yes, yes!

15:36.353 --> 15:37.645
So, this is the bridge deck aft,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.397
where you tend
to have most meals.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.357
Okay.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.775
We can head up to the sundeck.

15:41.816 --> 15:42.859
Did you all just fly in?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.194
-Yesterday.
-Oh.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.404
-Is anyone tired, or...
-No, oh, of course not.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.623
I can’t wait to see the cabins.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.876
So, this cabin
is the master suite.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.878
Wow!

16:01.920 --> 16:03.004
Oh, my God.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.464
-Ooh, ooh!
-It’s coming.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.424
So, this one’s the VIP cabin.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.176
Oh, you guys, this is cool.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.678
They have Poo-Pourri
in every bathroom.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.762
-Oh!
-Notable.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.185
That’s Lisa over that side.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.649
You look hot as [bleep], woman.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.735
Oh, my God, I’m gonna cum,
you look beautiful, yes.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.278
These girls are like

16:27.320 --> 16:28.822
the Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.533
They’re the Gilmour Girls
on steroids, I swear.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.284
Do you know what time
you’d like to eat lunch?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.703
What time do you guys
wanna eat lunch?

16:34.744 --> 16:35.745
3:00?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.749
Are we doing ’70s tonight?

16:39.791 --> 16:40.750
Yes, tonight.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.127
[shrieks]

16:42.168 --> 16:43.294
Okay, so then what time
do you wanna do that?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.713
Let’s work backwards.

16:44.754 --> 16:45.714
8:30 or 9:00.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.257
See how I have a V?

16:47.298 --> 16:49.759
So, I dropped the port one there
and the starboard one there.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.428
That’s how you want it.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.929
Right, yeah, good to know.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.848
How are you feeling?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.016
I’m fine.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.184
I was tired that night...

17:12.157 --> 17:13.950
Is it an arrival cocktail?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.326
It’s a blue raspberry shot.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.121
We have the pineapple
upside-down cake shot.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.664
We’ve got piña coladas here.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.833
There’s some nice
mulberry smoothies.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.631
I would openly say something
to Tasha about the provisions,

17:28.673 --> 17:31.885
and say that we shouldn’t
be doing maybe as much,

17:31.926 --> 17:34.596
but I also just don’t wanna
get into the bad books,

17:34.637 --> 17:37.390
and I just wanna keep a
happy, healthy interior.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.560
But I can say not saying
something could long-term

17:40.602 --> 17:42.270
maybe make things a bit worse.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.151
Holy [bleep], this is crazy.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.694
What are you doing?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.112
I’m gonna put some jet-skis
in the water for you.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.073
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah!

17:53.114 --> 17:54.491
Oh, my God!

17:54.532 --> 17:56.034
Do you guys have, like,
a beer bong that,

17:56.076 --> 17:57.744
like, goes down from, like,
one deck to the next deck?

17:57.786 --> 18:00.663
No, but Kyle’s got this
friend called Steven.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.083
Steven is the tenth member
of our crew.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.002
Can I please use this
after the setup?

18:06.044 --> 18:07.587
It’s gonna be a good
party-starter.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.632
He’s big, he’s bald,
he’s beautiful.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.801
Did you guys want
something else to drink?

18:12.842 --> 18:15.845
Oh, my God.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.889
Steven’s here to party.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.641
Steven!

18:19.683 --> 18:22.477
But that’s, like, a good way
of drinking something out of.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.604
But it’s, like, a secret thing.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.439
Would you like me to start
bringing lunch up shortly?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.816
Yeah, you wanna do lunch?

18:27.857 --> 18:29.192
Where are we sitting,
where are we gonna sit?

18:29.234 --> 18:30.652
Just downstairs, one level.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.405
Yeah, the jet-ski’s
going in the water.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.532
Jet-ski going in the water.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.493
Our guests would like to
have a stand-up paddle yoga

18:38.535 --> 18:39.869
session in the morning.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.038
-In the water!
-It’s going in the water!

18:42.080 --> 18:45.625
In the water,
in the jet-ski.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.378
Maybe around 8:00 a.m.,
if that’s possible?

18:48.420 --> 18:49.379
All right, let’s go down,
everybody.

18:49.421 --> 18:50.380
Yeah, sit at the table.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.715
Get outta here.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.425
Wait, wait, do we wanna
know about Steven?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.136
Oh, yes, do you think we could
take a shot with Steven?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.220
Out of Steven?

18:57.262 --> 18:59.055
-Out of Steven?
-Not right now.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.348
I thought it was out of Steven.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.766
-With?
-I thought it was with Steven.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.059
Who’s Steven?

19:03.101 --> 19:06.563
Ugh.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.106
Okay, I’ll get
Steven for you.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.399
-Not yet, not yet.
-Right now?

19:09.441 --> 19:10.525
-No...
-I’m thinking this evening.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.110
You’re thinking this evening.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.695
I think this Steven should make
an appearance this evening.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.612
Okay.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.947
You turned it off, didn’t you?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.783
Can I say something tragic?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.661
My Botox appointment is for
two days after we get back.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.456
Botox, you are 26 years old.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.082
Rachel, you’re gonna look
like a crazy woman,

19:26.124 --> 19:27.083
you’re so beautiful.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.127
Not a lot, not a lot of it.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.255
I wanna have fun and be creative
and show off my skills.

19:32.297 --> 19:35.967
Favorite cuisines, elevated
Californian, Mediterranean.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.679
L.A.-style food to me is,
like, deconstructed fresh food.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.474
So, a deconstructed dish is
when you don’t have time

19:42.515 --> 19:44.559
to set it in a natural mold.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.936
I can deconstruct all
the food you want me to,

19:46.978 --> 19:48.813
but I’d rather
just construct it.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.774
That’s what I’m paid for.

19:50.815 --> 19:51.900
Yeah.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.029
-Cheers to yachting.
-To yachting.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.447
Okay, we’re gonna lock this
off as close

19:57.489 --> 19:58.615
to the NautiBuoy as possible.

19:58.656 --> 20:02.327
Like, do you wanna
help Courtney?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.411
Oh, my God.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.788
That looks fabulous.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.622
Oh, so sweet.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.248
Let’s go, homies.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.292
And then bring it in, got it.
Probably a touch into there.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.420
We’ve got vegetable wrap, and
then we’ve got pita bruschetta.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.922
Oh, my God, this is Godly.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.301
-He nailed the assignment.
-He killed it.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.969
After they finish their lunch,

20:20.011 --> 20:21.221
two of my guys are gonna stay
with them to be in the water.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.806
Yeah.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.599
Then another other person
is gonna have to come with me

20:24.641 --> 20:26.059
-and do two trips to the beach.
-Yeah.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.477
Because we’re gonna have
to go set everything up.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.978
-You okay?
-Yeah.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.313
It’s like L.A. cuisine
and the Mediterranean

20:30.355 --> 20:31.314
had a baby together.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.816
Yes, exactly.

20:34.025 --> 20:34.984
Thank you.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.611
All right, beach.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.571
I think we’re gonna do rugs,
chairs, tables, cooler boxes.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.073
No, that would be sweet,
that’ll be fine.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.370
Oh.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.998
Oh, shame.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.131
Eh?

20:56.172 --> 20:58.216
Yeah.

20:58.258 --> 21:02.095
What’s happened between me and
Tash, it feels like a new start.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.555
But I feel it can be better.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.683
I fell very quickly,
we all know that.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.393
So, obviously there’s always
a bit of hope

21:08.435 --> 21:10.687
that she would run away
from her boyfriend

21:10.729 --> 21:12.689
and then look
who would be there.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.566
So, there’s always that option.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.074
Coming up...

21:27.871 --> 21:29.706
Now we’re in the pitch black.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.130
I’d like to get them
to the boat before dark.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.050
Sunset’s at 7:00.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.260
Right, so what time should
I say, tender at 6:00, or?

21:42.302 --> 21:45.096
No, tender at 20 past 6:00.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.182
Whatever’s on this toast,
I wanna kiss on the mouth.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.768
It’s like some sort of, like,
onion caramelized bruschetta.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.771
They need, what, two of these,
two of the bigger ones.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.316
That’s eight chairs.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.485
We just need to go, dude.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.288
All right, let’s just
start moving, brü.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.289
Yeah.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.874
I’ve got a great team.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.126
Courtney with tender-driving,
Mzi with guest operations,

22:15.168 --> 22:17.671
Jason with scuppers,
I don’t know.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.507
But at the same time,
I can’t expect people

22:20.548 --> 22:23.510
to kind of mirror me, because I
think they would ----ing die.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.512
They’d be, like,
this is too much.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.683
I was going to send you
on a break.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.559
Why can’t we just be together?

22:31.601 --> 22:32.811
Why don’t you just go now?

22:34.688 --> 22:36.231
Is this a meatball?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.399
Falafel.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.025
Oh, dear.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.574
Ah, there’s that dodgy wig...
oh, that’s great.

22:46.616 --> 22:50.245
If I could go back in a time
machine, it would be the ’70s.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.372
You can dance, you can have fun,

22:52.414 --> 22:55.583
no horrible text messages coming
through your phone constantly.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.335
That’s a good one for tonight.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.795
Right, pull it out.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.256
-Eh?
-Pull it out.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.758
I’m thinking like this vibe,
brü, like, on the contour,

23:03.800 --> 23:06.052
and then behind it,
our table will go.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.095
Yeah.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.555
Then we gotta get
tiki torches in.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.808
What are you doing?
Here, here, here, like this.

23:11.850 --> 23:14.269
Gonna set it wider.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.770
We use both mats.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.397
Yeah, but that’s awkward
sizes, you know?

23:17.439 --> 23:20.108
At the moment, things just feel,
like, a bit disjointed.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.360
I think Storm’s also just,
like, very, very stressed,

23:22.402 --> 23:26.281
so he’s just, like, bah,
bah, that, that, that.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.366
And it’s like...

23:28.408 --> 23:30.493
Storm’s usually the person
that’s doing things himself,

23:30.535 --> 23:33.663
so hopefully in time,
he’ll learn to delegate.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.874
I don’t know, it’s weird.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.710
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

23:38.752 --> 23:39.711
One more.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.254
Eight, nine...

23:41.296 --> 23:42.756
I don’t know why
I’m counting to nine.

23:42.797 --> 23:44.382
-Why are you counting?
-I have no idea.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.635
So, me, Kelsey, and
Alex went to FSU together.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.304
One time at a party in college,

23:49.346 --> 23:52.474
Rachel wanted to throw up,
found a red Solo cup at the bar,

23:52.515 --> 23:57.145
threw up in it, set it back
down, and continued partying.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.772
What’s wrong,
my hands weren’t there?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.899
Make nice here, like,
maybe put some rocks.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.070
At 20 passed 6:00,
the tender’s going to take you

24:05.111 --> 24:08.114
into the beach so you can have
a few cocktails on the beach.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.417
-How was lunch guys?
-Delicious.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.960
It was so good.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.922
Hold my hand,
and then step right here.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.382
I know it’s a bit of a step...

24:25.423 --> 24:26.758
You did it, well done.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.135
These actually look quite
cool on the couch.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.267
[laughing]

24:36.309 --> 24:37.769
Are you kidding?

24:37.811 --> 24:38.937
There we go.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.939
Wow, this is really cute.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.440
Where’s everyone?

24:42.482 --> 24:43.650
They’ve gone to the beach.

24:43.692 --> 24:44.901
What can I offer?

24:44.943 --> 24:47.404
I’ve made a cocktail with
tequila.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.114
I would like your tequila drink.

24:49.155 --> 24:49.906
Okay.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.282
Very good choice.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.243
You’re plating
everything tonight, yeah?

24:53.284 --> 24:55.745
Yeah, but it’s, like,
not really plated.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.872
The tartare goes in
a little Japanese spoon.

24:57.914 --> 25:01.209
There’s a gazpacho, like...

25:01.251 --> 25:03.044
it’s super light,
it’s like finger food.

25:03.086 --> 25:07.048
Tonight for dinner the guests
requested tapas, which is nice.

25:07.090 --> 25:10.135
I love going to like, San
Sebastian, and the tapas there.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.388
You can put so much passion
into this, like, one dish,

25:13.430 --> 25:14.764
and it doesn’t take long,

25:14.806 --> 25:16.349
because you’re not
prepping as much of it.

25:20.353 --> 25:23.440
Either gonna stab my hand
or my stomach.

25:26.651 --> 25:27.986
Like that?

25:28.028 --> 25:29.487
It needs to be more melted,
though, right?

25:29.529 --> 25:30.947
No, no, it’s fine.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.449
Like, once you put
the biscuit on top...

25:32.490 --> 25:33.616
Oh, really?

25:33.658 --> 25:35.201
It smells so good.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.412
Do you prefer cookies and cream
flavor or milk chocolate flavor?

25:37.454 --> 25:39.247
-Whoa.
-Dang.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.999
Cookies and cream,
I think, for me.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.417
Yeah?

25:42.459 --> 25:45.086
You have to, like, separate
your butt muscles,

25:45.128 --> 25:46.588
like, from your thigh muscles,

25:46.629 --> 25:48.048
and just, like...

25:48.089 --> 25:48.882
[laughing]

25:48.923 --> 25:50.467
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.512
I’ll just go and do the garbage
whilst you’re putting that away.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.805
That sounds good.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.391
Are they love hearts or boobs?

25:59.476 --> 26:01.102
Boobs.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.739
You look like the type of guy

26:12.781 --> 26:14.866
that would enjoy
a nice flower power party.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.117
Flower power?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.660
Like ’70s, like Austin Powers?

26:17.702 --> 26:19.746
Yeah.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.456
I mean...

26:21.498 --> 26:23.500
You remind me of "Scooby Doo,"
the guy from there, Shaggy.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.251
I don’t know if I should
be offended or not.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.753
No, he’s cool.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.590
Yeah, Storm and Mzi are gone.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.884
What’s taking so long?

26:32.926 --> 26:35.053
They’re still ashore,
it’s not okay.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.554
Do you need a refill?

26:36.596 --> 26:38.431
-Oh, yes, please.
-Yeah.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.983
They’re out of range.

26:52.445 --> 26:53.613
Yeah.

26:53.655 --> 26:57.492
-Just round this bend, I think.
-Okay.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.328
It’s never a great idea to have
the guests ashore after dark.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.247
First of all, we don’t
have the light.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.915
Secondly, something
could kick up.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.458
Now we’re in the pitch black.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.962
Storm should know always
stay in touch with me.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.429
All right.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.055
-Are we in trouble?
-It’s the angel.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.640
-It’s not dark.
-It’s not that dark.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.642
-Okay bye!
-Woohoo!

27:22.684 --> 27:24.394
Ugh!

27:24.436 --> 27:27.272
I need to work on time
management for sure,

27:27.313 --> 27:29.649
but you aren’t the ----ing
owner of the boat.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.152
Pull the jet-ski up, get off the
jet-ski, come and speak to me;

27:32.193 --> 27:33.862
get in the jet-ski and leave.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.948
Don’t shout over like
you’re Brad Pitt

27:36.990 --> 27:38.450
and you ----ing just own Malta.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.578
That’s not how
things work, mate.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.164
What’d he say?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.003
Storm, Storm, Storm, Sandy.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.884
Spooky swimming!

27:55.925 --> 27:57.344
This is crazy,
what the [bleep]?

28:01.806 --> 28:02.932
Coming up...

28:02.974 --> 28:04.267
The anchor’s off the bottom,

28:04.309 --> 28:05.560
and I think it’s
been twisting around.

28:05.602 --> 28:06.853
You’ll have to dive
in the water.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.605
This is really dangerous.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.412
Ooh, I like those.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.048
Yeah, I’m here,
Jason’s getting changed.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.549
Okay, I’m gonna make
these shots, then.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.928
Woo!

28:39.969 --> 28:41.388
[chattering]

28:41.429 --> 28:43.306
Let’s get this party started.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.599
Woo!

28:44.641 --> 28:46.601
Oh, my God,
my hair’s in my face.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.645
I’m constantly
thinking about Frank.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.438
Woo!

28:52.065 --> 28:54.442
I’m trying to make it seem like
I’m having the time of my life.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.027
Okay, let’s get a photo,
let’s get a photo.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.404
Oh, yay! Woo!

28:57.445 --> 28:59.072
But I know I’m gonna
make it through.

28:59.114 --> 29:01.908
It might not be my top...

29:01.950 --> 29:05.704
I wouldn’t even say top 50
best charters I’ve ever had,

29:05.745 --> 29:08.248
but I mean, it’s an experience.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.541
I need that photo.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.084
Okay, let’s get this
thing on first,

29:11.126 --> 29:12.627
because it’s the heaviest.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.382
Oh, this is gonna be a very
interesting tender ride,

29:17.424 --> 29:19.426
because there’s
a lot of sh--.

29:19.467 --> 29:22.971
I’m just gonna go double-check.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.104
Copy that.

29:34.733 --> 29:35.900
The trip, yeah, the loved it.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.277
-Hey, Storm.
-Yeah.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.237
I just wanna have a quick chat
in the morning.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.114
-Copy that.
-Cool, thanks, Cap.

29:41.156 --> 29:42.699
I’ve always wanted long hair!

29:42.741 --> 29:44.617
You actually suit the wig.

29:44.659 --> 29:45.660
Ah!

29:45.702 --> 29:47.579
Dude, that is
actually hilarious.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.040
[laughing]

29:50.081 --> 29:51.374
This one, then, yeah?

29:51.416 --> 29:52.792
I’ve got a lot of
surfer dude mates,

29:52.834 --> 29:55.420
and I’m always so
jealous of their hair.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.714
Growing up,
I actually had hair.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.424
Yeah, it just went.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.426
Just started shaving my head
when I was, like, 16.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.470
I did try and grow it back
a few times,

30:03.511 --> 30:06.306
but then all that was left was,
like, the fringe, you know?

30:06.348 --> 30:09.017
Just had this thing
in front of my head.

30:09.059 --> 30:10.226
----ing like a little alien.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.562
-I’ve got so much to do.
-Same.

30:12.604 --> 30:16.566
I just always wanted to do
this and stuff, and go...

30:16.608 --> 30:19.736
get out of the water,
and do that.

30:24.616 --> 30:25.784
Woo!

30:25.825 --> 30:28.995
Let’s find out
if blondes have more fun.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.413
Let’s find out.

30:35.502 --> 30:37.462
-Woo!
-All right, let’s go.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.338
Yeah.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.340
You and I look like sisters.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.138
-Ooh!
-Cool.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.015
Oh, they have a fun light!

30:49.057 --> 30:51.309
Oh, my God, this is so pretty,
I really want those sunglasses.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.519
This is next-level, you guys.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.480
-Look at your pants!
-Your pants!

30:55.522 --> 30:57.065
Do a twirl, twirl, twirl.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.234
Give us a twirl, woo!

30:59.275 --> 31:01.194
We have two different wines.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.487
It’s mainly fish this evening,

31:02.529 --> 31:04.864
so I would suggest going
with a white wine.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.117
We’re good with it.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.993
I’m gonna go look on the bridge.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.370
You can just
make out the anchor.

31:10.412 --> 31:12.288
Guys, please check,
look at the plates,

31:12.330 --> 31:13.540
make sure there’s no hair
in them as well,

31:13.581 --> 31:14.749
because we’ve all got wigs on.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.710
-Yeah.
-Okay.

31:16.751 --> 31:20.046
Oh, my God,
what is going on here?

31:20.088 --> 31:21.589
-Ah!
-Oh, it’s Sonny Bono!

31:21.631 --> 31:25.135
So, I call it a garden of
pickled vegetables and flowers,

31:25.176 --> 31:27.178
and this is a watermelon broth.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.264
This is so good.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.224
-Oh, my gosh.
-Not as beautiful as his wig.

31:31.266 --> 31:33.143
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you so much.

31:33.184 --> 31:35.103
-Beautiful!
-Oh, my God.

31:36.438 --> 31:37.355
Wow.

31:37.397 --> 31:38.898
Oh, my God, it’s unbelievable.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.316
Whoa.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.534
Do you? Still?

31:49.576 --> 31:51.202
Mm-hmm.

31:55.206 --> 31:56.583
Very Tarzan.

31:56.624 --> 32:00.545
They all like sushi,
so hopefully they like it.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.464
Oh, my. Woo!

32:02.505 --> 32:04.132
All right, guys, so this is
a shiso leaf on the base,

32:04.174 --> 32:07.093
and I’ve got some sour linguini
and mango, a bit of sashimi,

32:07.135 --> 32:09.596
and there’s some ginger
and a mild chili.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.681
Just pick it up like a taco
and dive straight in.

32:11.723 --> 32:13.266
Your fresh fishes
are so different.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.434
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.019
Look, it’s delicious.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.854
Last charter was super tough.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.191
Oh, I thought that
was the bao bun.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.233
It’s out of order now, though.

32:22.275 --> 32:25.445
What country is this?

32:25.487 --> 32:27.322
But now everybody’s killing it.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.323
Me and Tash are
getting on really well,

32:28.365 --> 32:29.366
the guests are stoked.

32:29.407 --> 32:30.825
This is how it’s done.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.660
I think it’s really important
to be friends

32:32.702 --> 32:35.080
with the interior crew to make
your job run smoothly.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.790
It’s hard work, too.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.334
Respect to the interior team,
I definitely couldn’t do it.

32:39.376 --> 32:41.836
Still to this day, I cannot
fold a bloody T-shirt.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.672
I don’t understand
why the arms...

32:43.713 --> 32:45.840
they just don’t...
it just doesn’t work.

32:45.882 --> 32:49.344
It just doesn’t...
it’s not... no.

32:49.386 --> 32:50.762
I cannot be a stew.

32:50.804 --> 32:53.807
To be honest, I want them
to be really full

32:53.848 --> 32:58.395
so that they’re too full
to stay up till 5:00 a.m.

33:07.529 --> 33:10.073
I mean, he’s baking these
beautiful breads, it’s amazing.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.825
I know.
It’s incredible.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.995
Oh, it’s...
yeah, it’s just like that.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.248
And there’s
a little mushroom on top.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.375
All right, this is good to go.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.336
Very ’70s, this.

33:24.295 --> 33:25.505
And here we have the Wagyu beef.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.840
My favorite thing is eating

33:26.881 --> 33:28.842
a bunch of little bites
of a lot of things.

33:28.883 --> 33:29.926
Yeah.

33:29.968 --> 33:31.803
-This is so good.
-It’s so good.

33:31.845 --> 33:35.515
Yeah?

33:35.557 --> 33:36.516
Hey.

33:36.558 --> 33:37.642
Bitch.

33:41.646 --> 33:44.357
* Small waist, pretty face,
with a big, fat bank *

33:46.651 --> 33:48.653
Oh, my God.
Okay, good night.

33:50.238 --> 33:52.323
What if we go have
a dance party?

33:52.365 --> 33:56.828
-Let’s party!
-Woo!

34:00.790 --> 34:02.917
All right, ladies,
I’m outta here, goodbye.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.377
-Goodbye.
-See ya.

34:04.419 --> 34:05.378
-Peace!
-Night, Mommy.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.422
Espresso martini.

34:08.923 --> 34:11.259
Woo!

34:14.262 --> 34:15.263
Woohoo!

34:15.305 --> 34:16.931
Oh, this is groovy.

34:16.973 --> 34:19.934
Groovy cruise, ooh.

34:21.311 --> 34:23.229
The tequila one.

34:23.271 --> 34:24.814
[laughing]

34:27.692 --> 34:28.443
Shelby.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.903
And then the vodka one.

34:29.944 --> 34:30.904
Whee!

34:30.945 --> 34:32.072
Thank you.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.949
Who wants to kiss
under the disco ball?

34:34.991 --> 34:38.286
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

34:40.997 --> 34:42.874
People make me cringe.

34:44.459 --> 34:48.421
I just really wanna know
what is up with Steven.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.882
Oh, Steven, yeah.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.509
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Tash.</i>

34:52.550 --> 34:54.844
The ladies are
ready for Steven.

34:54.886 --> 34:57.305
Oh, you guys...
it’s never ending.

35:00.183 --> 35:01.434
It’s a bunch of
11-year-old girls

35:01.476 --> 35:02.686
stuck in 22-year-old bodies.

35:02.727 --> 35:04.896
Shelby, give us
an ETA on the groove.

35:04.938 --> 35:06.564
It seems like
the groove is here!

35:06.606 --> 35:08.942
Groove, groove is in the house!

35:08.983 --> 35:10.318
Ooh, disco was born!

35:14.489 --> 35:16.866
Well, they asked, so...

35:19.661 --> 35:21.830
Well, when they see him,
they’ll know.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.378
I’ve got it in the bell end.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.338
You’ve got it in the bell end.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.048
It’s frothing.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.520
Steven’s in town.

35:45.562 --> 35:47.313
-Ah!
-Oh-ho-ho!

35:47.355 --> 35:50.734
-Here’s Steven.
-Oh.

35:50.775 --> 35:52.819
He’s filled with tequila.

35:55.363 --> 35:58.616
So, does anyone
wanna try Steven?

36:06.708 --> 36:07.250
Steven’s in town.

36:08.376 --> 36:10.045
Ah!

36:10.086 --> 36:11.296
Oh, no, this is so bad.

36:11.338 --> 36:15.759
So, does anyone
wanna try Steven?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.385
He’s filled with tequila.

36:17.427 --> 36:19.554
Okay.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.890
All you have to do is you
lick the salty tip...

36:21.931 --> 36:24.893
Oh... oh, no, this is so bad.

36:24.934 --> 36:26.895
We didn’t
know this was Steven.

36:26.936 --> 36:28.271
We didn’t know this was Steven.

36:28.313 --> 36:29.314
We thought he was,
like, a nice...

36:29.356 --> 36:30.648
like, a pirate.

36:30.690 --> 36:31.733
I’m just gonna squirt
it like this.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.109
No, no, no, don’t do it, stop!

36:33.151 --> 36:34.361
Stop, stop, stop.

36:34.402 --> 36:36.780
I wasn’t gonna make contact.

36:38.365 --> 36:39.908
It’s honestly painful to watch.

36:39.949 --> 36:41.534
They’re such an awkward group.

36:41.576 --> 36:44.412
Yeah, I thought it would
be, like, something silly.

36:44.454 --> 36:47.123
-Babe.
-Thank you, Shelby.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.043
All right, girlies.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.544
-You’re going to bed?
-Need to go to bed now.

36:51.586 --> 36:53.880
I’m simply going
to fall right asleep.

36:53.922 --> 36:56.257
-I know.
-I’m so tired.

36:56.299 --> 36:58.259
Good night, darling.

36:58.301 --> 36:59.719
Good night, Sheeby, love you.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.763
See you for our final day.

37:09.729 --> 37:12.482
Like, Tash wanted to
take Steven up,

37:12.524 --> 37:15.485
and she did, and it was
a complete ----ing fail.

37:15.527 --> 37:17.195
Yeah.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.698
And I said, "I don’t suggest
you do this" from the beginning.

37:26.830 --> 37:28.289
First charter, like,
all the deckhands,

37:28.331 --> 37:31.001
I’m like, they’re a little...
kinda like this,

37:31.042 --> 37:32.210
where’s it’s, like,
a little more sensitive.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.461
Mm.

37:33.503 --> 37:35.046
Maybe not as open to,
like, my jokes.

37:35.088 --> 37:37.590
I was, like, I’m locking it up
with certain people.

37:37.632 --> 37:38.967
It’s like we know it’s like,

37:39.009 --> 37:40.802
okay, I’m not gonna be 100
percent myself.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.846
Yeah, I know what you mean.

37:44.097 --> 37:46.016
The people I get along with
the most

37:46.057 --> 37:49.019
are not outside working with me,
and that sucks.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.812
But at the same time,
all the things

37:50.854 --> 37:54.816
I randomly know how to do,
like sewing, juggling, sailing,

37:54.858 --> 37:56.151
all these things are just

37:56.192 --> 37:57.652
because I’m interested
in something.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.487
I don’t really feel an age gap,

37:59.529 --> 38:05.160
but I definitely feel a culture
gap in regards to interests.

38:05.201 --> 38:09.080
Like, I haven’t been able
to find some common ground,

38:09.122 --> 38:11.166
so it’s actually really...
like, it’s a bummer.

38:15.879 --> 38:17.213
You’re actually coming up here?

38:17.255 --> 38:18.757
Yeah, I’m misbehaving.

38:18.798 --> 38:20.592
No, you’ve gotta keep above
the sheets, though.

38:20.633 --> 38:22.302
Well, put your sheets down.

38:22.344 --> 38:24.679
But if you’re cold, I get to
have the sheets, I get cold.

38:24.721 --> 38:25.972
But you actually have no sheets.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.807
-All right.
-Oh, your wig, finally.

38:27.849 --> 38:29.017
Oh.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.368
Now the bitch is back.

38:46.409 --> 38:47.869
Right, I’ve gotta go.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.871
I might have thrown some
of my stuff on your bed.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.831
-Just put it on my bed.
-All right.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.171
[bleep]

39:18.149 --> 39:23.905
So, our tender driver,
the queen herself,

39:23.947 --> 39:27.575
we’ve got a yoga instructor set
up for them with her own boards.

39:27.617 --> 39:28.910
Okay.

39:28.952 --> 39:30.578
Which is gonna make
our lives a lot easier.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.122
Yay.

39:35.125 --> 39:35.959
Yeah.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.961
-Good morning.
-Morning.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.132
Nicely done.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.098
Oh [bleep]’s sake.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.224
Excuse me.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.286
All right, thanks,
Squish, bye.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.997
Who the hell is that?

40:16.499 --> 40:17.667
Um...

40:19.753 --> 40:20.712
Yeah.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.131
What?

40:23.173 --> 40:25.925
Dave, boyfriend,
Dave, boyfriend...

40:25.967 --> 40:27.761
it’s kind of just keeping her
from focusing on,

40:27.802 --> 40:29.346
like, the main goal, which is,

40:29.387 --> 40:31.806
like, getting this job done and
getting a great charter tip.

40:34.267 --> 40:36.686
Storm, can you come
to the bridge?

40:36.728 --> 40:38.980
-We outta here.
-We outta here.

40:39.022 --> 40:40.440
Court, you’re driving?

40:40.482 --> 40:41.649
Hell, yeah.

40:41.691 --> 40:43.234
-Let’s go!
-Good luck, gals.

40:43.276 --> 40:45.320
Okay, so, I don’t expect you
to know all this stuff,

40:45.362 --> 40:47.447
because you’ve never
done this before.

40:47.489 --> 40:49.908
So, you can never be
out of radio range.

40:49.949 --> 40:51.493
I couldn’t reach you,

40:51.534 --> 40:54.621
and I like to keep a line
of sight on my team, right?

40:54.662 --> 40:55.830
Sure.

40:55.872 --> 40:57.707
Because just in case
this dies or...

40:57.749 --> 40:59.209
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.002
I mean, that’s why I sent
Jason on the WaveRunner.

41:01.044 --> 41:02.170
Okay.

41:02.212 --> 41:04.089
The minute the sun goes down,

41:04.130 --> 41:05.507
they need to be back
with the guests.

41:05.548 --> 41:07.175
Sure.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.177
Because we’re responsible
for everybody, that’s all.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.095
Of course, yes.

41:10.136 --> 41:11.262
I just need you to know that,

41:11.304 --> 41:12.681
and you did a great
job yesterday.

41:12.722 --> 41:15.016
You can explore
and scout locations.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.518
-Okay.
-Sure.

41:16.559 --> 41:18.061
But you cannot remain ashore.

41:18.103 --> 41:19.521
-I need you here.
-All right.

41:19.562 --> 41:20.522
You’re running around too much.

41:20.563 --> 41:22.023
Mm-hmm.

41:22.065 --> 41:24.109
Trust them,
let them make mistakes.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.318
Sure.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.528
Correct them,
don’t try to do their job.

41:26.569 --> 41:27.779
And it needs to happen.

41:27.821 --> 41:30.156
-You can run the davit...
-Sure.

41:30.198 --> 41:33.034
You’re my person
that I rely on.

41:33.076 --> 41:34.035
-Okay.
-You know what I mean?

41:34.077 --> 41:35.286
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay?

41:35.328 --> 41:37.330
I’m so used to not
being the bosun,

41:37.372 --> 41:40.542
and I’m so used to being in
a deck team

41:40.583 --> 41:43.086
where the bosun can rely on me
to do anything

41:43.128 --> 41:47.382
that I need to do, but I’m
usually left to do my own thing.

41:47.424 --> 41:50.385
I understand that I need
to learn how to delegate.

41:50.427 --> 41:53.430
If I can rely on someone and
not have to check up on them,

41:53.471 --> 41:55.473
it’ll make things go
a lot more smooth.

41:55.515 --> 41:57.017
So, that’s my goal.

41:57.058 --> 41:58.893
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

42:00.228 --> 42:02.814
[bleep] this cling film
is so sh--.

42:02.856 --> 42:05.442
We’re gonna start our class.

42:05.483 --> 42:06.776
Have you tried yoga before?

42:06.818 --> 42:07.777
-Yeah.
-Yes!

42:07.819 --> 42:09.279
All of you.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.739
Come on, Court!

42:10.780 --> 42:12.240
Bye!

42:12.282 --> 42:16.453
Oh, boy, I think it’s spinning
around the chain.

42:16.494 --> 42:19.080
I wanna bring up
the starboard anchor.

42:19.122 --> 42:21.207
Which one do we have more
chain in the water on?

42:21.249 --> 42:22.584
Like, both.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.670
Oh, then we can see
the way it is laying out here.

42:25.712 --> 42:26.963
All right.

42:27.005 --> 42:28.089
It’s going straight up and down.

42:28.131 --> 42:29.424
We could bring up the port.

42:29.466 --> 42:30.550
Ready?

42:36.306 --> 42:37.766
Uh-oh.

42:37.807 --> 42:40.769
[bleep]. Let me see.

42:40.810 --> 42:42.187
See, it’s just...

42:42.228 --> 42:43.480
it’s just come with
the anchor underneath.

42:43.521 --> 42:45.732
You’ll have to dive
in the water.

42:45.774 --> 42:47.108
I brought my mask, yeah.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.443
Yeah, because the anchor’s
off the bottom,

42:48.485 --> 42:50.820
and I think it’s
been twisting around.

42:50.862 --> 42:53.740
And close your eyes
for a few moments,

42:53.782 --> 42:56.076
to breathe through the nose in,

42:56.117 --> 43:00.121
deeply, and through
the nose out, slowly.

43:15.595 --> 43:16.930
We’re totally ----ed.

43:16.971 --> 43:18.348
How far is the anchor down?

43:26.356 --> 43:28.817
So, if we drop the starboard
more, it’s gonna release.

43:28.858 --> 43:31.778
So, go ahead and
tie it after he... yeah.

43:31.820 --> 43:34.030
This is really dangerous.

43:34.072 --> 43:36.491
Storm’s plan is to go down,

43:36.533 --> 43:42.038
use his own body on a
very sharp, heavy anchor.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.998
If he just gets nicked,
that’s not a nick,

43:44.040 --> 43:46.042
that’s a arm that’s gone.
