WEBVTT

00:01.727 --> 00:03.727
I mean, when my boyfriend Oscar
found out

00:03.820 --> 00:05.671
that my best friend Max told me
he wanted to kiss me,

00:05.898 --> 00:07.339
I didn't know how he'd react.

00:07.675 --> 00:08.507
Oscar?

00:08.843 --> 00:10.751
Are you there?

00:10.903 --> 00:11.902
Are you mad?

00:11.995 --> 00:14.238
Damn Joey Lawrence
and his big mouth.

00:14.331 --> 00:15.906
I forgot to mention that part.

00:15.924 --> 00:19.000
Oscar found out about the whole
Max thing from Joey Lawrence.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.911
You remember that show, right?
It was, like, him

00:20.929 --> 00:23.080
and the sister with the flower
hat. She used to, like,

00:23.098 --> 00:24.672
-dance like this...
-Whoa!

00:24.692 --> 00:25.415
Exactly!

00:25.509 --> 00:26.692
"Whoa!" Anyway,

00:26.843 --> 00:29.086
Oscar didn't say anything
for almost three minutes,

00:29.104 --> 00:30.345
and I was starting to freak out.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.115
I'm starting to freak out.
Say something.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.868
Okay, now you're standing.
Is standing good?

00:36.095 --> 00:38.370
I mean, it can be. That movie
<i> Stand and Deliver</i> was good,

00:38.597 --> 00:41.265
but Stephen King's<i> The Stand</i>
was so scary.

00:41.358 --> 00:43.208
You... picked... me!

00:43.435 --> 00:45.269
Over Max, with his perfect hair,

00:45.287 --> 00:47.379
chiseled jaw
and searing blue eyes.

00:47.606 --> 00:49.423
So you're not mad?

00:51.034 --> 00:53.777
(laughing)

00:53.796 --> 00:55.779
He was not mad.
(chuckles)

00:55.872 --> 00:56.780
In fact,

00:56.873 --> 00:58.039
things got a little smoky,

00:58.059 --> 00:59.224
if you know what I mean.
(chuckles)

00:59.451 --> 01:00.875
(chuckles)
That's a nice story.

01:00.969 --> 01:02.043
Can I have my coffee now?

01:02.063 --> 01:02.969
Oh! Yeah.
(chuckles)

01:03.122 --> 01:04.045
Sorry. Enjoy!

01:04.065 --> 01:05.380
(chuckles)

01:05.399 --> 01:07.983
Little tip: don't ask her
how her day's going.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.028
Hi. How are you doing today?

01:11.888 --> 01:12.963
Fine.

01:12.981 --> 01:15.240
I'm fine, too.
You want to know why?

01:15.467 --> 01:17.859
It all started
at Mr. Meowskers' funeral.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.561
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:19.655 --> 01:21.822
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
Special delivery
for Ms. Katharine Silver.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.327
Well, golly gee, that's me.
(chuckles)

01:28.089 --> 01:29.421
Is this actually mine though?

01:29.573 --> 01:31.090
No, kiss is
the special delivery.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.499
-That's just a prop.
-(chuckles softly)

01:32.593 --> 01:33.650
Oh, my goodness,

01:33.743 --> 01:36.744
I cannot get over
how cute y'all are.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.155
How long you been dating now?

01:38.173 --> 01:39.581
How long have we been dating?

01:39.675 --> 01:40.766
Well, when do we start counting?

01:40.917 --> 01:42.101
Yeah, is it
the first time we met?

01:42.328 --> 01:43.510
Ooh, or the first time
we kissed?

01:43.662 --> 01:46.330
Or the, uh, first time we,
you know...

01:46.423 --> 01:48.732
You mean the first time
I rocked your world?

01:49.835 --> 01:52.185
Let's just go with when you met.

01:52.338 --> 01:53.612
Almost four months.

01:53.763 --> 01:55.280
Aw. How y'all gonna celebrate?

01:55.432 --> 01:58.450
Marty and I got our ears pierced
on our four-month anniversary.

01:58.602 --> 02:01.286
Oh, uh, we don't really have
anything planned.

02:01.438 --> 02:02.846
Did you want to do something?

02:02.865 --> 02:04.514
I got both my ears pierced
in college.

02:04.608 --> 02:05.699
They got really infected.

02:05.851 --> 02:06.867
I almost lost a lobe.

02:07.019 --> 02:08.961
But I am willing
to roll the dice for you.

02:09.188 --> 02:10.354
(chuckles)
No, that's okay.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.539
I-I like your ears
just the way they are.

02:12.691 --> 02:13.948
They are nice.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.884
Very soft.

02:16.862 --> 02:18.137
As weirdly soothing as this is,

02:18.288 --> 02:20.697
I should probably deliver
this package before I lose it.

02:20.716 --> 02:21.882
Does that happen often?

02:22.034 --> 02:24.434
Officially? No.

02:26.129 --> 02:28.147
Oh! You forgot your phone!

02:28.298 --> 02:29.148
One more kiss for the road?

02:29.299 --> 02:31.041
Permission to dip my best gal?

02:31.059 --> 02:33.527
Permission granted, sailor.

02:34.229 --> 02:35.821
(clears throat loudly)

02:35.972 --> 02:36.655
(yells)

02:36.806 --> 02:38.490
-Oh! Oh, God!
-Ow!

02:40.810 --> 02:42.310
-(groans)
-(exhales)

02:42.404 --> 02:43.662
Okay.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.238
(panting)

02:45.391 --> 02:46.907
Catch you on the flip side.

02:47.059 --> 02:48.024
Toodles!

02:48.026 --> 02:49.893
Did you just say "toodles"?

02:49.912 --> 02:52.171
He started it with "flip side."

02:53.232 --> 02:54.080
I don't know how to act
when he's around.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.340
No, I get it.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.342
I just really hope
we can get past this.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.903
I don't expect you to be besties
or anything.

02:59.922 --> 03:01.996
I'm lying. I do.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.183
I did kinda like him before.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.667
Yeah, let's build on that.

03:05.761 --> 03:09.021
You know, you can't
just throw away "kinda like."

03:10.749 --> 03:12.357
I guess I'm up for it if Max is.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.525
Thank you.

03:13.677 --> 03:15.085
Oh. I landed on this.

03:15.103 --> 03:16.177
Are you gonna get in trouble?

03:16.197 --> 03:17.421
No. Happens all the time.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.104
Really?

03:18.257 --> 03:19.990
Officially? No.

03:21.777 --> 03:23.260
(sighs)
Okay.

03:23.353 --> 03:24.369
I have to go.

03:24.596 --> 03:25.612
-I'm gonna be late for work.
-(whines softly)

03:25.764 --> 03:27.113
Aw, just five more minutes.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.432
No, you said that
ten minutes ago.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.042
You're like
a sexy snooze button.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.043
(both chuckle)

03:31.270 --> 03:33.212
You know you talk in your sleep?

03:33.363 --> 03:35.214
-Did you know you fart in yours?
-Yeah.

03:35.441 --> 03:37.958
-You told me in your sleep.
-(laughs)

03:38.110 --> 03:39.960
What's the deal
with this tattoo?

03:40.112 --> 03:41.887
Uh, it's a fish.

03:42.038 --> 03:43.964
I can see it's a fish.

03:44.116 --> 03:45.557
What does it mean?

03:45.709 --> 03:46.558
What's it matter?

03:46.785 --> 03:47.875
I don't know. I mean,

03:47.970 --> 03:49.711
there's just so much
I don't know about you.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.547
Well, I like keeping things
mysterious with us.

03:52.641 --> 03:54.474
You know,
we are secret hookup friends,

03:54.568 --> 03:56.793
not "know your time of birth"
friends.

03:56.886 --> 03:59.129
Wait, I'll give you a ride.

03:59.147 --> 04:00.555
We can't show up
at the same time.

04:00.649 --> 04:02.966
Kat is already suspicious
about where I've been sleeping.

04:03.059 --> 04:05.727
Wouldn't it just be easier
to tell everyone about us?

04:05.821 --> 04:06.820
Nope.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.139
Okay, but before you go,

04:09.232 --> 04:11.141
one small detail about you.

04:11.234 --> 04:12.325
Your middle name.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.827
Nope.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.145
Thank you

04:15.163 --> 04:17.130
for the intercourse.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.930
Hey. I brought you something.

04:25.081 --> 04:26.247
Ooh, muffin.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.824
I asked you not to call me that.
(chuckles)

04:27.843 --> 04:31.177
(chuckles) Your dad would be
proud to know his jokes live on.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.846
(chuckles)
Hey, uh, while I'm here,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.848
maybe we could talk
about the Oscar thing?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.150
(playing piano)

04:38.170 --> 04:39.611
Come on, Max. This is important.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.338
(continues playing)

04:41.431 --> 04:43.657
Fine. We'll do it your way.

Are these not the furriest

06:03.847 --> 06:04.754
paws you've ever seen?

06:04.773 --> 06:06.180
Clearly you have not spent

06:06.200 --> 06:08.700
a lot of time
around Mama's feet.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.595
Oh, Katharine, I brought you
a little something.

06:11.613 --> 06:12.779
Oh, thank you.

06:12.931 --> 06:13.613
What is it?

06:13.765 --> 06:15.690
It's a fertility statue.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.950
For your anniversary.

06:17.102 --> 06:20.045
Put it above your bed
next time you and Oscar,

06:20.196 --> 06:21.863
you know, make pudding.

06:22.774 --> 06:26.868
This is why I was 19 before
I knew where babies came from.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.462
How did you know
it was my anniversary?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.872
A little birdie told me.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.724
Tweet, tweet.

06:32.876 --> 06:35.135
So, what are you
and Oscar gonna do?

06:35.229 --> 06:39.547
Kat seems surprisingly reluctant
to mark this momentous occasion.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.383
It's not momentous.
It's four months.

06:42.477 --> 06:45.629
Yes, the longest relationship
you've ever had.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.072
There should be fireworks.

06:47.299 --> 06:48.407
Banks should close.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.634
Drag queens should dress
like you.

06:50.652 --> 06:51.743
(chuckling)

06:51.912 --> 06:54.079
(sighs) Well, I-I suppose
I could do something.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.229
But I've got to play it cool.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.415
I don't want to scare him off.

06:56.566 --> 06:57.916

I wouldn't want a grandchild
with Ben's eyebrows anyway.

07:19.331 --> 07:20.588
Oh, I have an idea.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.516
How 'bout I help cook
a nice, tasteful dinner

07:23.669 --> 07:25.001
for you and Oscar.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.186
No tap shoes needed.

07:26.338 --> 07:28.447
Oh, you're like
my own little Cupid.

07:28.598 --> 07:31.599
Oh, I'll bring my bow
and arrows! (chuckles)

07:31.693 --> 07:32.617
Metaphorically.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.995
I don't need another lawsuit.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.682
What-what are you doing?

07:38.700 --> 07:40.274
I'm just getting it warmed up.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.960
Stop it!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
(alarm ringing)

07:46.115 --> 07:48.175
(ringing continues)

07:50.028 --> 07:51.377
What's going on?

07:51.530 --> 07:53.213
Oh. I was trying
not to wake you.

07:53.365 --> 07:54.547
I'm meeting Max to go running.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.532
Really?

07:55.550 --> 07:57.642
Oh, that's great! I'm so happy!

07:57.794 --> 08:00.220
Can I come? No, no, no,
you guys need to bond.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.648
Um, hey, I was just thinking--
if you're not busy tonight,

08:03.800 --> 08:05.725
maybe we could do something
for our anniversary.

08:05.877 --> 08:07.377
Sure. What'd you have in mind?

08:07.470 --> 08:09.713
Um, just, like, a little dinner.
No big deal.

08:09.731 --> 08:12.215
A year anniversary--
that would be a big deal.

08:12.234 --> 08:13.325
You know? Eight months--
medium deal.

08:13.552 --> 08:15.327
But this, you know,
it's no big deal.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.662
Got it. Little dinner,
no big deal.

08:17.889 --> 08:18.997
See you tonight.

08:22.452 --> 08:23.243
Oh. Randi.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.670
-Good morning!
-Is it?

08:27.991 --> 08:30.091
(door closes)

08:31.995 --> 08:34.971
Hey! I just got to stop
for a minute!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.349
We're not
so much running together

08:37.500 --> 08:39.518
as I'm chasing you.
(exhales)

08:40.762 --> 08:43.763
-(panting)
-Okay, maybe I was pushing it
a bit.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.358
I just wanted
to win at something.

08:47.085 --> 08:47.934
You're taller.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.844
Thank you. I needed that.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.588
(chuckles)

08:51.606 --> 08:53.865
Listen, I know things
have been awkward between us,

08:54.017 --> 08:55.349
and I know it's my fault.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.277
You mean 'cause you made a move
on my girlfriend?

08:57.429 --> 08:58.278
(panting)

08:58.430 --> 08:59.538
Well...

08:59.689 --> 09:02.541
if you want to get technical
about it.

09:03.769 --> 09:05.602
Yeah. I owe you an apology.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.361
Cool.
(panting)

09:07.381 --> 09:09.506
Cool.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.808
Was that it?

09:11.868 --> 09:14.094
Oh, I thought it was. Uh...

09:14.963 --> 09:15.887
I will elaborate.

09:16.039 --> 09:18.114
Um...

09:18.133 --> 09:19.373
You're a nice guy,

09:19.467 --> 09:21.375
and you didn't deserve
what I did.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.303
Neither did she.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.304
I'm sorry.

09:24.456 --> 09:25.789
I can forgive you

09:25.807 --> 09:28.233
-if we never have
to go running again.
-(chuckles)

09:28.384 --> 09:29.309
Deal.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.069
-How 'bout pancakes?
-Great.

09:31.296 --> 09:32.796
But... I need you

09:32.814 --> 09:33.905
-to do me a favor.
-Sure.

09:34.057 --> 09:35.240
Carry me.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.575
(laughs)

09:38.136 --> 09:39.411
(door opens)

09:41.898 --> 09:44.140
Stop calling the café
for coffee.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.642
Stop keeping me up all night.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.734
You don't mean that.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.420
-No, I do not.
-(chuckles)

09:49.238 --> 09:50.404
Well, you know, Kat asked me

09:50.498 --> 09:52.148
to take her lingerie shopping
later.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.742
Maybe I'll pick up
something<i> you</i> might enjoy.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.576
Ooh.

09:55.670 --> 09:56.702
I would like that,

09:56.855 --> 09:58.430
Miss Randi Elizabeth.

09:58.581 --> 10:00.432
What the hell
did you just call me?

10:00.583 --> 10:02.175
Your name?

10:02.327 --> 10:04.160
-But who told you?
-I ain't no snitch.

10:04.253 --> 10:06.587
-Was it Phil?
-Yes. Damn it!

10:07.349 --> 10:08.498
What else did he tell you
about me?

10:08.516 --> 10:10.257
Nothing.
Why are you so upset about this?

10:10.352 --> 10:12.185
Because I asked you not to pry
into my business

10:12.279 --> 10:14.095
and you did it anyway.

10:14.189 --> 10:15.505
I got to get back to work.

10:16.766 --> 10:19.509
I forgot that Kat has
her anniversary dinner tonight,

10:19.527 --> 10:21.010
so I still need
a place to crash.

10:21.029 --> 10:22.603
But you can kiss that lingerie
goodbye.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.107
You're gonna get my baggiest
sweatpants and tube socks.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.125
Joke's on you!

10:27.276 --> 10:28.201
Because I find the tube

10:28.295 --> 10:29.669
to be the sexiest of socks!

10:37.195 --> 10:38.786
So, what vibe are we going for?

10:39.122 --> 10:40.305
Sexy and sophisticated?

10:40.456 --> 10:41.881
Schoolgirl with an attitude?

10:42.033 --> 10:44.625
Or are we talking
full-on dominatrix?

10:44.719 --> 10:48.313
I don't know. My underwear
usually comes in a four-pack.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.890
Well, what do you think
Oscar would like?

10:51.042 --> 10:52.892
No, we are not shopping
for Oscar.

10:53.044 --> 10:54.060
We are shopping for you.

10:54.212 --> 10:55.820
What do you like?

10:55.972 --> 10:57.304
Um...

10:57.324 --> 10:58.639
This is cute.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.809
Okay, maybe we should shop
for Oscar a little bit.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.310
Aren't you
gonna try anything on?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.479
You know, for your sneaky link?
(chuckles)

11:05.573 --> 11:09.575
Do not use the slang
that I teach you against me.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.152
And he's not getting anything.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.912
He really irked my nerves today.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.080
What happened?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.507
-He found out my middle name.
-(gasps)

11:15.734 --> 11:17.917
That rat bastard.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.402
I just don't need him knowing

11:19.495 --> 11:21.070
every little detail
about my life.

11:21.089 --> 11:22.422
Well, I like when people know

11:22.574 --> 11:24.015
every little detail
about<i> my</i> life.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.909
I wish I could wear one
of those medical bracelets,

11:25.927 --> 11:29.095
but, instead of allergies, it
would have fun facts about Kat.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.838
I'd call them Kat Facts.

11:30.932 --> 11:32.857
Well, that's not how<i> I</i> operate.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.600
Knowledge is power,

11:34.753 --> 11:37.086
and I don't want anyone
having power over me.

11:37.105 --> 11:38.530
I mean, first,
it's my middle name.

11:38.681 --> 11:39.923
Then it's my blood type.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.592
Next thing you know, I'm
swallowing a balloon of cocaine,

11:42.610 --> 11:45.519
being arrested at the border and
thrown into a Turkish prison.

11:45.613 --> 11:49.374
You have got to stop listening
to<i> Locked Up Abroad</i> before bed.

11:50.618 --> 11:53.286
And no one's gonna take
your power from you.

11:53.438 --> 11:55.046
I mean, you've opened up to me,

11:55.273 --> 11:57.607
and I'm still terrified of you.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.551
Aw, you're sweet.

11:59.702 --> 12:01.219
And, for what it's worth,

12:01.370 --> 12:03.204
I think you can trust Carter.

12:03.298 --> 12:04.371
What?

12:04.466 --> 12:06.373
Carter?
(chuckles, stammers)

12:06.468 --> 12:08.560
What makes you think
it's Carter?

12:13.549 --> 12:15.308
Oh! Hey.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.052
Where'd you sneak off to
last night?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.313
Uh, I was... with a guy.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.466
Ah. So that's where
you've been going.

12:23.485 --> 12:24.743
What's his name?

12:24.894 --> 12:25.910
Peter...

12:26.137 --> 12:27.996
Backpack.

12:29.324 --> 12:31.416
That is
a completely plausible name!

12:31.643 --> 12:34.160
And what does that have
to even do with Carter?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.379
-(knocking)
-Oh, I got it.

12:39.242 --> 12:40.333
Here. You left your earrings.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.002
Thank you, Peter Backpack. Bye!

12:43.154 --> 12:46.080
CARTER:
Who the hell is Peter Backpack?!

12:46.132 --> 12:47.824
Okay, fine, it's Carter.

12:47.842 --> 12:48.658
I knew it!

12:48.676 --> 12:49.934
I wasn't 100% sure,

12:50.161 --> 12:51.995
but now I know it's Carter!

12:52.013 --> 12:53.179
He's a great guy.

12:53.331 --> 12:55.681
Well, yeah, I guess he's okay.

12:55.834 --> 12:58.610
But I'm still not sure
if I should open up to him.

12:58.761 --> 13:01.279
I mean, I've done that before,
and it gets kind of messy.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.114
If you keep worrying
about things getting messy,

13:03.266 --> 13:05.858
you might miss out
on things that are really great.

13:06.011 --> 13:08.953
I mean, does ice cream
end up on my face,

13:09.105 --> 13:12.348
in my hair, down my cleavage
every time I eat it?

13:12.367 --> 13:13.107
Yes.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.275
But is it worth it?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.701
You bet.

13:15.854 --> 13:17.854
Okay, I keep telling you--
cup instead of cone.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.280
But...

13:19.374 --> 13:20.447
I hear you.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.374
Now, if you would,

13:21.468 --> 13:22.375
drumroll, please.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.594
Oh.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.887
Randi, I have never felt sexier.

13:35.040 --> 13:35.980
I...
(chuckles)

13:36.132 --> 13:37.148
Whoa! Oh!

13:37.375 --> 13:38.983
Sorry, ma'am.
Oh, geez. I'm good.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.819
Whoa! I can walk like a woman.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.570
Oh, hey!

13:44.140 --> 13:45.306
Mm-mm.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.367
-(camera clicks)
-I'm just gonna hold on to this.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.980
Okay. The table is set,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.481
the champagne is chilling

13:54.501 --> 13:56.817
and I hid everything
with googly eyes

13:56.837 --> 14:00.229
so they wouldn't see me
slip into this.

14:00.248 --> 14:01.581
Oh, girl.

14:01.733 --> 14:04.926
That's what Mama would call
a one-way ticket to hell.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.995
I am so glad
you're getting into this.

14:08.122 --> 14:11.349
I'm a big believer
in celebrating every moment.

14:11.576 --> 14:13.242
A nice sunrise,

14:13.261 --> 14:14.927
a-a perfect pie crust,

14:15.080 --> 14:17.021
a healthy bowel movement.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.690
-Totally.
-(chuckles softly)

14:18.841 --> 14:21.584
Don't act like you can't relate.

14:21.603 --> 14:22.843
(phone rings)

14:22.863 --> 14:24.604
Oh. It's Oscar.

14:24.756 --> 14:25.755
Hi!

14:25.848 --> 14:26.939
<i> Hey, babe, guess what.</i>

14:27.033 --> 14:28.557
Um, you found five dollars.

14:28.559 --> 14:29.516
You're in jail.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.610
Pluto's a planet again.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.445
I love that you actually guess.

14:32.597 --> 14:34.780
No, I'm at a basketball game
in a luxury suite.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.207
My boss
couldn't use his tickets,

14:36.434 --> 14:37.617
and Max really wanted to go.

14:37.769 --> 14:39.544
-Oh, Max is there?
<i> -MAX: Hey, Kat!</i>

14:39.695 --> 14:42.363
Oscar is the man. I haven't seen
so many free hot dogs

14:42.382 --> 14:43.456
in my life.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.608
So does this mean
you'll be a little late?

14:46.369 --> 14:49.445
Actually, would it be okay
if we pushed dinner to tomorrow?

14:49.464 --> 14:51.372
Oh. Um...

14:51.391 --> 14:53.540
Uh, y-yeah.

14:53.635 --> 14:55.134
Yeah. No big deal.

14:55.286 --> 14:56.469
But keep an eye on Max.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.105
He will eat free food
till he pukes. (chuckles)

14:59.900 --> 15:01.274
He has had six hot dogs.

15:01.384 --> 15:03.359
Seven!

15:04.963 --> 15:06.154
Oh.

15:07.482 --> 15:08.740
Oscar's not coming.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.242
He's at a basketball game
with Max.

15:11.469 --> 15:13.136
Oh, no, sweetie.

15:13.154 --> 15:15.413
No, don't worry about it.
(mutters)

15:15.564 --> 15:17.081
Don't need these anymore.
But I'm fine.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.474
It's totally fine. It's fine.

15:18.493 --> 15:19.417
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

15:19.568 --> 15:20.919
-Don't need this anymore.
-No, no!

15:21.146 --> 15:22.645
I know you're upset.

15:22.664 --> 15:25.423
But if you throw any more
of my cooking in the trash,

15:25.574 --> 15:27.383
I'll cut you.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.836
I just feel silly
about the whole thing.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.764
I wish I hadn't made such
a big deal out of it.

15:32.915 --> 15:36.083
Well, I think you should have
made a bigger deal out of it.

15:36.177 --> 15:38.327
A rooster who doesn't crow

15:38.421 --> 15:40.254
cannot be mad
when folks don't wake up.

15:40.348 --> 15:43.833
Yeah, but what if the rooster's
afraid to-to lose the only hen

15:43.851 --> 15:46.002
who's stayed with her
for four months?

15:46.095 --> 15:48.020
Oh, honey.

15:48.173 --> 15:51.115
Have some faith in yourself.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.360
Oscar is lucky to have you.

15:54.512 --> 15:55.602
Thank you.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.513
-Aw.
-(patting back)

15:57.532 --> 16:01.017
Wait a minute. Why am I not
looking at the top of your head?

16:01.110 --> 16:02.293
Mmm.
(chuckles)

16:02.445 --> 16:05.204
I couldn't help myself.
(chuckles)

16:05.298 --> 16:07.540
If you're going to hell, honey,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.041
I'm going with you.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.512
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.103
Hey.

16:21.222 --> 16:22.963
Hey.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.707
I didn't think I'd see you here.

16:25.468 --> 16:28.695
Well, Peter Backpack
was busy, so...

16:30.139 --> 16:31.698
Sit down. I'll get us a drink.

16:33.901 --> 16:36.068
Listen...

16:36.162 --> 16:37.311
you were right.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.813
You laid out some very clear,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.057
very strict--

16:41.075 --> 16:44.335
some would say illogical--
boundaries...

16:45.171 --> 16:47.413
...and I did not respect them.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.749
That's on me,

16:49.901 --> 16:51.009
and I'm sorry.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.585
I appreciate that.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.972
I know that you were just trying
to get to know me better.

16:56.665 --> 16:58.224
That's all I want.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.503
Then allow me
to introduce myself.

17:02.597 --> 17:05.189
My name is
Miranda Elizabeth Hamilton.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.191
Elizabeth was my nana's name.

17:07.418 --> 17:09.101
My favorite color is green.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.528
I've never seen<i> Titanic.</i>

17:10.679 --> 17:12.697
Ooh, and automatic toilets
freak me out.

17:12.848 --> 17:14.866
I'll tell you when I'm done.

17:15.017 --> 17:16.868
Good to know.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.594
The<i> Titanic</i> thing is troubling,

17:18.613 --> 17:20.371
but my heart will go on.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.666
You'd get that if you'd seen it.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.545
And you asked
about my fish tattoo.

17:27.696 --> 17:30.606
I got it to remind me
that when things get tough

17:30.625 --> 17:32.625
to just keep swimming.

17:32.777 --> 17:34.293
Like in<i> Finding Nemo.</i>

17:34.387 --> 17:35.278
Finding who?

17:35.296 --> 17:37.388
Have you seen any movies?

17:38.283 --> 17:41.017
Please, keep going.

17:42.044 --> 17:44.562
Okay. Um...

17:45.714 --> 17:48.624
I don't usually talk about this,
but...

17:48.717 --> 17:51.235
when I got my tattoo, I was...

17:51.387 --> 17:54.647
really struggling
with depression.

17:54.799 --> 17:56.966
Oh, wow.

17:56.984 --> 17:58.451
I would've never guessed.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.496
Yeah, you get good at hiding it.

18:02.731 --> 18:04.473
Are things better now?

18:04.492 --> 18:06.417
Most days.

18:06.569 --> 18:08.235
I mean,
I found a great therapist,

18:08.254 --> 18:09.812
the right meds, and...

18:09.831 --> 18:13.091
I finally feel like
I have control over my life.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.718
But now...

18:16.821 --> 18:18.221
Now what?

18:19.340 --> 18:22.433
I'm scared
that if I let someone new in

18:22.585 --> 18:24.343
I could lose that.

18:24.495 --> 18:26.437
Randi...

18:28.166 --> 18:31.400
...we can take things
as slow as you want.

18:32.337 --> 18:34.112
I'm not going anywhere.

18:34.263 --> 18:35.988
(chuckles softly)

18:36.841 --> 18:38.366
Thanks.

18:40.862 --> 18:42.161
(kisses)

18:42.956 --> 18:44.530
So, uh,

18:44.682 --> 18:46.940
have you told
your therapist about me?

18:47.034 --> 18:49.127
Oh, my goodness.

18:50.112 --> 18:52.112
(door opens)

18:52.132 --> 18:55.115
Well, well, well,

18:55.135 --> 18:57.193
if it isn't Mr. Basketball.

18:57.211 --> 18:59.137
Liking the nickname,

18:59.364 --> 19:00.638
worried about the tone.

19:00.865 --> 19:02.789
Are you mad?

19:02.884 --> 19:03.866
I was.

19:03.959 --> 19:04.976
This helped.

19:05.127 --> 19:06.144
Phil helped.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.720
We actually had a lovely night.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.630
We ate dinner, we sang songs,

19:09.649 --> 19:10.815
we crowed like roosters.

19:11.042 --> 19:13.559
If you're hungry,
there's popovers in the trash.

19:14.729 --> 19:18.214
S-Starting to think tonight was
a bigger deal than you let on.

19:18.232 --> 19:20.716
Well, first it wasn't.
Then it was.

19:20.735 --> 19:24.220
Well, maybe it always was
and I just said it wasn't.

19:24.238 --> 19:26.497
I don't know. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.483
Anyway...
(sighs)

19:29.502 --> 19:33.004
this is the longest relationship
I've ever had,

19:33.155 --> 19:34.821
and I planned this big,

19:34.841 --> 19:37.917
fancy romantic dinner
to celebrate it.

19:38.069 --> 19:38.918
But, instead,

19:39.070 --> 19:40.085
Phil tried on all my shoes

19:40.238 --> 19:42.238
and I ate three pieces of cake.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.408
Kat, you got to tell me
when things are important.

19:45.501 --> 19:47.092
I was afraid
of scaring you away.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.578
You know? I have a tendency
to come on a little strong.

19:49.672 --> 19:51.505
Oh, you come on very strong.

19:51.599 --> 19:53.507
It's one of the things
I like most about you.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.434
-That and your laugh.
-(chuckles)

19:55.586 --> 19:58.112
And when you break into
spontaneous tap dancing.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.448
Suck it, Ben.

20:01.183 --> 20:02.441
I'm sorry I wasn't here,

20:02.535 --> 20:04.944
and I promise not to miss
our five-month anniversary.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.764
I'll save the lingerie I bought
for then. (chuckles)

20:08.783 --> 20:10.357
Wait, there's lingerie?

20:10.451 --> 20:12.284
Real lingerie? Not just flannel?

20:12.437 --> 20:14.378
Yeah, it goes with the heels.

20:14.530 --> 20:17.440
I thought you said
you couldn't walk in heels!

20:17.458 --> 20:18.198
Oh.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.967
I found a work-around.

20:22.705 --> 20:23.554
This is sexy, right?

20:29.787 --> 20:32.379
There you are! I have
the whole day planned out.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.047
I'm gonna teach you
how to fly this kite,

20:34.067 --> 20:35.975
we'll have a picnic,
then we can ride our bikes

20:36.127 --> 20:37.142
to get snow cones.

20:37.295 --> 20:39.219
That sounds amazing!
(chuckles)

20:39.313 --> 20:41.364
(mouths):
Rain check?

20:42.408 --> 20:44.391
Oh, my God.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.893
Guess who I just saw
making out by the dumpsters.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.079
Uh, Lady and the Tramp.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.154
Two raccoons.

20:49.307 --> 20:50.322
George and Amal Clooney.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.250
They travel a lot.
It's possible.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.810
I love that you always guess.

20:54.829 --> 20:56.161
Randi and Carter!

20:56.256 --> 20:57.813
-What?!
-You're kidding!

20:57.832 --> 20:59.072
Those rascals!

20:59.166 --> 21:00.591
Why didn't anybody tell me?

21:00.743 --> 21:02.334
Because you can't keep a secret.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.678
Yes, I can.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.247
I got to call Sheila.
