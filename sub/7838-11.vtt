01:15.950 --> 01:18.005
Happy 3:00
in the morning, everyone.

01:18.006 --> 01:19.358
In a mere five hours,

01:19.489 --> 01:22.276
we'll be gazing at Springfield's
most exciting glacier,

01:22.320 --> 01:23.885
Springfield Glacier.

01:23.886 --> 01:26.560
I hope you're all wearing
glacier-appropriate clothing.

01:26.706 --> 01:29.555
Hey, check out my T-shirt.
It's wicked relevant.

01:29.675 --> 01:32.020
It's part of my "Things Suck"
line of clothing.

01:32.903 --> 01:36.057
Yes, well, while I disagree with
your T-shirt's assertion,

01:36.169 --> 01:39.183
I do encourage anything
that raises glacier awareness.

01:39.226 --> 01:41.016
Busward to adventure.

01:46.111 --> 01:49.609
So, Lise, ready for your trip?
- Sure am.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.951
See ya next fall.

01:53.388 --> 01:56.055
You make those same stupid
jokes every field trip.

01:56.229 --> 01:58.428
You work in the business
as long as I have,

01:58.430 --> 01:59.810
you're bound to repeat yourself.

02:00.873 --> 02:02.235
See ya next fall.

02:14.944 --> 02:20.261
So, Edna, I wrote up some possible
discussion topics for this trip.

02:20.222 --> 02:21.149
Oh, here's one.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.676
I'm still in love
with you. Discuss?

02:23.833 --> 02:25.447
Seymour, I've moved on.

02:25.611 --> 02:27.562
Our romance
is in the history books

02:27.563 --> 02:28.972
and there's nothing
worth highlighting.

02:29.973 --> 02:32.707
The Skin-man
doesn't give up that easily.

02:35.579 --> 02:38.781
These icy roads
are getting pretty gnarly.

02:47.291 --> 02:48.479
I'm not worried.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.749
My indemnity waivers.

02:50.781 --> 02:51.548
Stop the bus.

02:51.704 --> 02:52.976
We'll just use the chains.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.261
I feel like
I'm in Fitzcarraldo.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.313
That movie was flawed.

03:03.524 --> 03:07.948
Behold, children, the majesty
of Springfield Glacier.

03:08.086 --> 03:11.809
Crane your necks skyward
to behold its icy glory.

03:16.954 --> 03:18.679
What happened to the glacier?

03:18.807 --> 03:19.783
It's nearly melted.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.823
This must be due
to global warming.

03:22.971 --> 03:25.177
Young lady, the federal government's position on global warming

03:25.200 --> 03:26.606
is that it does not exist.

03:26.775 --> 03:28.216
The glacier's
doing just fine.

03:28.349 --> 03:31.011
No, it isn't.
It's a lump of slush.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.702
Look at it.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.104
I have a little girl
just like you at home.

03:34.229 --> 03:36.644
That's where she stays--
at home.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.023
Oh, I just love it here.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.931
So many things, and so many
things of each thing.

03:46.062 --> 03:47.700
Welcome to Sprawl-Mart.

03:47.865 --> 03:49.876
Can I get you a
cart or a basket?

03:50.038 --> 03:52.521
Grandpa,
you're a greet grater.

03:52.689 --> 03:55.314
I mean a great greeter.

03:55.461 --> 03:57.309
Now look who's senile.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.647
I'll take a cart.
- All right.

04:04.877 --> 04:05.797
Darn thing's stuck.

04:05.965 --> 04:07.571
I'll just give it a good yank.

04:09.627 --> 04:13.765
No...
...mes.

04:19.569 --> 04:23.711
Oh, Dad. How I'll miss your
cap, your walking stick,

04:23.904 --> 04:25.387
your plaster base.

04:25.585 --> 04:27.167
I'm down here,
you idiot.

04:27.211 --> 04:28.832
Dad.
Where's your base?

04:28.787 --> 04:30.219
Don't worry about that.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.734
Someone's gotta
greet the customers.

04:33.134 --> 04:34.409
Ah, they'll be fine.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.689
No. They're helpless
without a greeting.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.802
Look at 'em.

04:43.423 --> 04:45.212
Make me proud.

04:45.392 --> 04:47.366
Or at least
less ashamed.

04:51.002 --> 04:54.293
I'm gonna get a glacier postcard
and send it to my nana.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.564
She'll be like, "No way."

04:56.878 --> 04:58.138
Score.

04:58.394 --> 05:02.065
I'm going to exchange this beach towel
I bought at Sequoia National Park.

05:02.066 --> 05:04.844
I learned too late
that it implied tumescence.

05:08.562 --> 05:10.552
Ah, premodern man.

05:10.696 --> 05:12.392
If these wise warriors
could speak,

05:12.393 --> 05:13.694
what
would they tell us?

05:13.846 --> 05:15.132
They left a message
right here.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.146
Actually carved
into the rock.

05:21.290 --> 05:22.220
Nice work, Simpson.

05:22.398 --> 05:23.348
Feel free to
make a rubbing.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.345
Welcome to Sprawl-Mart.

05:29.479 --> 05:32.178
Pimple cream in aisle five.
Buenos nachos.

05:32.310 --> 05:34.485
Ask about our "señor" discount.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.516
Hey, Rabbi.
Jesus loves ya.

05:37.038 --> 05:37.802
Just kidding.

05:37.972 --> 05:39.870
Son, you are on fire.

05:40.008 --> 05:43.152
A million times better than that
worthless old coot you replaced.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.664
That coot
happens to be my father.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.627
Please continue.

05:46.783 --> 05:49.387
How would you like to be
a full-time Sprawl-Mart greeter?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.255
Is there a chance for advancement?
- No.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.676
Whoo-hoo. No pressure.

05:53.317 --> 05:55.962
Evidence suggests that this
Ice Age female was alone

05:56.125 --> 05:57.560
when she fell
into a crevasse.

05:58.035 --> 05:59.474
Dying  alone, huh?

05:59.419 --> 06:01.558
Terrible fate to befall
any woman--

06:01.719 --> 06:04.257
Ice Age or modern day.

06:04.402 --> 06:05.654
Seymour,

06:05.801 --> 06:08.458
I will now demonstrate
how over you I am.

06:08.650 --> 06:09.777
See that man?

06:09.915 --> 06:11.976
Take note of how
he's not you.

06:12.132 --> 06:13.265
Now watch.

06:14.099 --> 06:17.856
So, is there a Mrs.
Park Ranger Johnson?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.696
No, ma'am.
I'm married to the glacier.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.217
But, uh,
it's an open marriage.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.711
Then bring it, fool.

06:26.215 --> 06:29.145
Oh, for goodness sake.
You've moved on, have you?

06:29.071 --> 06:30.110
Well, so have I.

06:34.104 --> 06:35.258
Just play along.

06:43.418 --> 06:44.628
Listen, people.

06:44.776 --> 06:47.325
How can you stand there
eating snacks and being children

06:47.326 --> 06:49.322
when the world's glaciers
are vanishing?

06:49.402 --> 06:51.453
We have to do something
about it.

06:51.606 --> 06:53.944
Glaciers are nature's
alarm clock,

06:54.070 --> 06:56.064
and it's time for us to wake up.

06:56.274 --> 06:58.267
Can there be any doubt
that the culprit

06:58.398 --> 07:00.628
is greenhouse gas
produced by man?

07:02.445 --> 07:04.561
The only gas is coming
from Lisa's butt.

07:06.094 --> 07:07.405
People, please.

07:07.425 --> 07:09.891
I'm talking about toxic vapors.

07:10.804 --> 07:12.187
Emanations.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.820
Miasmas.

07:16.347 --> 07:19.070
Hey,  whoever's doing that,
get off the frequency.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.521
We're combing the woods.
There's a killer loose out here.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.570
Let him do it, Chief.
It lightens the mood.

07:25.498 --> 07:28.168
Oh, my God.

07:28.175 --> 07:29.983
That used to be a face.

07:29.793 --> 07:31.255
Bart!

07:36.710 --> 07:39.034
Help. I'm sinking
in the lake.

07:39.782 --> 07:42.176
You mean, you're
walking on the glacier.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.319
Whatever.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.371
Check it out.
That frog has a nerd on its butt.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.751
Bart, you are
the meanest,

08:03.906 --> 08:06.154
nastiest little boy
that ever lived.

08:06.309 --> 08:08.715
Hey, there's a dog in
the next car lookin' at me.

08:08.870 --> 08:09.784
Hey, dog.

08:09.962 --> 08:11.746
You don't even care
how upset I am!

08:11.928 --> 08:14.560
But this time, you
have gone too far.

08:14.765 --> 08:16.456
What are you gonna do,
tell Mom and Dad?

08:16.653 --> 08:18.239
They're powerless figureheads.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.370
You'll see.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.030
Oh, you will see.

08:24.451 --> 08:27.338
Good morning, world.
Eat my shorts.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.937
There'll be no shorts
eaten today, young man.

08:30.099 --> 08:32.399
Bart Simpson,
this is a restraining order.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.107
From now on, you must stay at least
20 feet away from your sister.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.159
Restraining order?
Bull spit.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.769
No piece of paper keeps me
from whaling on my sister.

08:43.809 --> 08:46.691
So, you see what happens when you
don't obey your restraining order?

08:46.858 --> 08:47.845
Yes, Chief Wiggum.

08:48.007 --> 08:49.067
And Snake,

08:49.195 --> 08:51.860
do you see what happens
when you kidnap the president?

08:52.007 --> 08:54.122
Oh, yes,
Chief Wiggum.

08:54.319 --> 08:57.883
And Lou, do you see what happens
when my coffee comes back cold?

08:58.047 --> 08:59.587
Chief, you ordered
an ice coffee.

08:59.745 --> 09:01.295
No, I said a nice coffee.

09:01.456 --> 09:02.330
Nice.

09:04.689 --> 09:08.707
Lisa, you took out a restraining
order against your own brother?

09:08.866 --> 09:09.656
Yes.

09:09.795 --> 09:12.910
The clerk also gave me this
bench warrant for Dad's arrest.

09:13.063 --> 09:14.352
Aw, damn it.

09:14.533 --> 09:17.796
Chief, how are we supposed to live
with our kids constantly separated?

09:17.951 --> 09:20.211
Hey, I don't make
the laws, I just...

09:20.648 --> 09:21.781
something with them.

09:21.871 --> 09:24.519
Look, this videotape should
answer all your questions.

09:27.444 --> 09:30.252
Get Out of my Dreams
and Also out of my car :

09:30.253 --> 09:31.930
A guide to your restraining order

09:35.907 --> 09:38.021
Hi, I'm Gary Busey.

09:41.325 --> 09:43.641
I'm here to explain
about restraining orders.

09:43.814 --> 09:46.286
The answers to all your
questions are in this video.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.645
So you've got a restraining order

09:49.829 --> 09:51.007
Meet Joe.

09:51.172 --> 09:52.579
Last name: Spaghetti-O.

09:52.762 --> 09:56.340
One night, Joe went to a party and
fell in love with a girl named Mary.

09:57.705 --> 09:59.045
Oh, man, I've been there.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.102
At first, Joe felt discouraged,

10:01.260 --> 10:03.645
but then he remembered
what his father taught him.

10:03.823 --> 10:04.897
"Never say die."

10:05.062 --> 10:06.437
"Quitters never prosper."

10:06.587 --> 10:08.384
And "No means yes."

10:24.757 --> 10:27.796
The next day, Mary got
a restraining order against Joe.

10:36.908 --> 10:39.193
Now Joe can't come
within 500 feet of Mary.

10:39.194 --> 10:42.829
He also can't call her or burn
his name in gas on her lawn.

10:43.675 --> 10:45.849
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

10:45.989 --> 10:47.997
Joe is me.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.120
And Mary is a composite
of 12 different women

10:51.293 --> 10:53.830
and a small
independent film company,

10:54.007 --> 10:55.874
all of whom couldn't deal
with me,

10:56.057 --> 10:58.228
because I'm too real.

11:01.418 --> 11:05.703
Oh, I always hoped we wouldn't be one
of those restraining order families.

11:06.053 --> 11:08.267
How am I supposed to know
if I'm 20 feet away?

11:08.517 --> 11:09.506
Don't worry, son.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.850
No one's going to make you count to 20.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.000
I have a more humane solution.

11:17.879 --> 11:22.050
This 20-foot pole will make Bart's
restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.953
And I used my Sprawl-Mart employee
discount to buy this fancy pole cover.

11:27.203 --> 11:31.650
It'll keep your pole looking great,
poke after poke after poke.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.868
Poke.

11:33.118 --> 11:35.168
Hey, this really works.

11:37.153 --> 11:39.767
Homer, why did you put the
screwdriver at the end?

11:40.017 --> 11:42.617
Show you what it's like in the real world.

11:44.156 --> 11:46.350
Bart, because of your sister's restraining order,

11:46.600 --> 11:50.351
there  is no place in this school you can legally
occupy without violating your order.

11:50.601 --> 11:51.529
Observe.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.050
A.M.  kindergarten made the Bart doll.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.850
P.M. kindergarten made the Lisa.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.350
The point is, we're not allowed
to have you in this building.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.368
Well, I've never been one to break the law.

12:05.618 --> 12:06.403
So long, Seymour.

12:06.653 --> 12:07.767
Give me a jingle sometime.

12:08.017 --> 12:08.706
I will, but...

12:08.956 --> 12:15.106
there is one place on school property
that falls outside all laws of man or God.

12:15.879 --> 12:17.579
No, you don't mean...?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.453
This place smells, and something's dripping on me.

12:21.803 --> 12:25.050
The smell is manure, and the dripping's manure.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.668
Now turn to chapter one of Math Safari.

12:28.918 --> 12:30.603
But we're already on chapter seven.

12:30.853 --> 12:32.703
Then you'll be teaching Willie.

12:34.617 --> 12:35.506
Don't  stand so

12:35.756 --> 12:39.050
Don't stand so close to me

12:39.300 --> 12:40.829
Her friend are

12:41.079 --> 12:42.750
So jealous

12:43.000 --> 12:46.053
You know how bad girls get

12:46.303 --> 12:49.550
Sometimes it's not so easy

12:49.800 --> 12:52.768
To be the teacher's pet

12:53.018 --> 12:56.203
Temptation, frustration

12:56.453 --> 12:59.767
So bad it makes him cry

13:00.017 --> 13:01.167
The bus stop...

13:01.456 --> 13:04.950
I'm afraid your arm has sustained
extensive nerve damage.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.000
The only cure is this anti-poking potion.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.950
Oops, missed the vein.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.253
Dang, missed it again.

13:13.503 --> 13:14.650
Sorry, I'm distracted.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.468
My housekeeper is suing me
for sexual harassment.

13:17.718 --> 13:19.603
She hung the mistletoe.

13:19.853 --> 13:21.903
What was I supposed to do?

13:26.717 --> 13:29.506
I like eating here with you,
Dad, especially without...

13:29.756 --> 13:31.806
"Don't have a cow, man."

13:32.600 --> 13:33.729
Yeah, he's all...

13:33.979 --> 13:35.550
"Cowabunga, dude."

13:35.800 --> 13:36.653
I mean, what's that mean?

13:37.103 --> 13:38.903
Nothing, I bet.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.768
Oh, need more soda.

13:42.018 --> 13:45.418
Homer, would you be interested in
the position of executive greeter?

13:45.853 --> 13:49.167
That's been my dream ever since
I heard it existed right now.

13:49.417 --> 13:50.106
What do I get?

13:50.356 --> 13:53.029
You get to work overtime
without us paying you extra.

13:53.279 --> 13:54.150
I won't do it.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.953
If you don't, we'll ship you
right back to Mexico.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.003
But I'm a U.S. citizen.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.500
How sure of that are you?

14:04.018 --> 14:04.968
Dios mio.

14:07.153 --> 14:08.267
I can't take it anymore.

14:08.517 --> 14:10.006
Every time I try to relax, she...

14:10.056 --> 14:11.206
Ow, my neck.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.200
Can't I even finish my milk?

14:22.679 --> 14:25.050
Please lift this restraining order,
Judge Harm.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.053
It's poking our family apart.

14:27.303 --> 14:28.850
Bart, do you have anything to say?

14:29.100 --> 14:31.068
My sister has no sense of humor.

14:31.318 --> 14:32.703
I'm sure you understand.

14:32.953 --> 14:35.267
It's why you became a judge
instead of finding a husband.

14:35.517 --> 14:36.606
I have a husband.

14:36.856 --> 14:38.350
What is he, blind and deaf?

14:38.600 --> 14:42.050
From now on, the restraining
order is set at 200 feet.

14:44.879 --> 14:46.479
That's 61 meters.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.250
Sacré bleu.

14:50.803 --> 14:51.450
Sorry, boy.

14:51.700 --> 14:56.468
This is the only place that's 200 feet
from Lisa but still on our property.

14:56.718 --> 14:58.518
It's pretty scary out here, Dad.

14:59.453 --> 15:00.753
Dad?

15:07.217 --> 15:09.317
Well, I bet they miss me.

15:28.456 --> 15:30.556
Well, could be worse.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.229
Bart, Lisa went over to Janey's.

15:36.479 --> 15:38.929
Quick, run inside and go potty.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.453
Why should I go inside?

15:41.703 --> 15:43.803
The world is my toilet now.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.668
Hey, why'd you lock the door?

16:01.918 --> 16:02.703
We're still inside.

16:02.953 --> 16:06.067
It's a chance for you to catch up
on all the work I'm assigning you now.

16:06.317 --> 16:08.429
I've never worked all night, never.

16:08.679 --> 16:11.750
And I worked at an all-night
diner for three years.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.853
I slept on the grill.

16:13.103 --> 16:16.003
See this? It's the bathroom key.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.268
See you in the morning.

16:18.518 --> 16:19.718
You monster.

16:21.853 --> 16:26.903
We placed a compliance chip in the back
of your neck during the company physical.

16:28.217 --> 16:29.106
That's it, mister.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.550
I am disgruntled.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.779
And up until now, I was relatively gruntled.

16:34.079 --> 16:36.279
Better increase the juice.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.050
Wait.

16:42.903 --> 16:44.350
I did it. I pulled it out.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.668
And with no brain damage-amage-

16:45.918 --> 16:48.068
amage-amage-amage-amage.

16:48.853 --> 16:53.567
Now we'll get all your chips out,
go to the police and shut this place down.

16:53.817 --> 16:55.806
Homer, we took our chips out years ago.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.250
Really? Then why do you still work here?

16:58.500 --> 17:01.029
We've learned to accept
the things we cannot change...

17:01.279 --> 17:04.128
and steal everything that's not nailed down.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.252
I hope you won't judge us harshly.

17:09.502 --> 17:11.603
I'll be back for tall kitchen bags.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.668
Lisa, don't you think your
brother's suffered enough?

17:48.918 --> 17:52.403
Mom, I don't mean to be mean, but every
time I think about forgiving him,

17:52.653 --> 17:55.167
I remember all the bad things he's done to me.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.106
He's done good things for you, too.

17:57.356 --> 17:58.656
Name three.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.529
He brought home your homework
when you were sick.

18:01.779 --> 18:04.350
Yes, but he thought that was a bad thing.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.500
Let's count it anyway.

18:07.203 --> 18:10.303
He did try to cheer me up
when my hamster died.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.150
Homer, you forgot to eat your hot dog.

18:20.718 --> 18:22.368
Mmm, hot dog.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.953
What the...?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.717
I just don't understand what the problem is.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.729
Okay, that's two, and that's it.

18:45.979 --> 18:48.079
If I think of another one,
I'll let him back in.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.050
Stupid, selfish Bart.

19:01.303 --> 19:04.203
Like he's ever going to
do another nice thing for me.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.200
He's building a me.

19:13.118 --> 19:17.903
Well, I mean, it's a little American-primitive,
but who am I to dismiss outsider art?

19:18.153 --> 19:20.753
It shows he misses me, and this is the third thing.

19:24.217 --> 19:26.006
Lise, just let me be.

19:26.256 --> 19:26.950
Look in your heart.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.929
I'm begging you, look in your heart.

19:29.179 --> 19:29.950
Bart, don't worry.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.853
I'm relinquishing the poke-pole.

19:32.103 --> 19:33.050
What does that mean, you're sharpening it?

19:33.300 --> 19:33.868
Look in your heart.

19:34.118 --> 19:34.803
I'm begging you.

19:35.053 --> 19:35.667
Look in your heart.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.106
I'm not sharpening it.

19:37.356 --> 19:38.250
Are you putting feces on the tip?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.600
No, I'm giving it up.

19:42.679 --> 19:45.050
I've realized how much I missed you,
and I can see from this

19:45.300 --> 19:49.000
magnificent Lisa statue
that you felt the same way.

19:51.903 --> 19:52.950
When you're right, you're right.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.068
Let's eat.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.303
Yo, Bart, we're ready to torch
the wicker witch of the west.

19:57.553 --> 20:00.167
Jimbo, the real one's here.

20:00.417 --> 20:04.117
Oh, man. This is every effigist's
worst nightmare.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.850
Bart, you were going to burn the third
nice thing you've ever done for me?

20:10.100 --> 20:14.229
Well, you see, the fire represents....

20:14.479 --> 20:16.750
your musical ability?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.353
Oh, Bart, I missed your lies.

20:20.603 --> 20:22.650
And I was kind of a pill, I guess.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.668
Lisa, you just poked my feelings.

20:25.918 --> 20:27.603
I'm sorry, too.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.803
Give me that torch.
