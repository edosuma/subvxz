00:47.989 --> 00:52.060
While we let that cream softener dry,
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.860
When you're pounding those nails,

00:53.949 --> 00:57.650
do you hit your thumb more than you hit
the head of the nail? Sure you do.

00:57.749 --> 01:01.449
Tool tip from old Tim is
use a household bobby pin to hold the nail.

01:01.550 --> 01:05.900
You secure it, no problem.
Al, you want to hold that for me?

01:08.229 --> 01:10.860
The point of the bobby pin
is that you can do it yourself.

01:10.949 --> 01:15.939
But Al, you're such an important part
of the show. I want your help.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.939
Good reflexes, Al.
Do you play lacrosse or something?

01:40.030 --> 01:44.340
There you go. We've set the nail.
and no one's injured any appendages.

01:44.429 --> 01:47.499
Before we say goodbye.
we get tons of cards and letters.

01:47.590 --> 01:51.580
and I'd like to share
a real special one with you.

01:52.870 --> 01:54.939
Thank you, Al.

01:56.509 --> 01:57.939
Lisa?

01:58.630 --> 02:01.300
Here you go, Tim. Special delivery.

02:01.390 --> 02:05.380
- This is from Rock Lannigan of Bay City.
- OK, thank you. Lisa.

02:05.469 --> 02:11.259
Rock writes. "Dear Tim. I'm the foreman for
K&B Construction Company in Bay City."

02:11.350 --> 02:13.340
"My crew and I watch you all the time:'

02:13.429 --> 02:17.780
"We love your clothes, especially the
Italian look with the triple-pleated slacks."

02:17.870 --> 02:19.659
Thanks, fellas.

02:20.669 --> 02:22.969
He goes on to say:

02:23.070 --> 02:26.979
"Anyway, my crew and I put in
a damn hard American day's work.

02:27.070 --> 02:31.340
and we get tired of eating a cold lunch
out of a metal pail." And who wouldn't?

02:31.429 --> 02:34.140
"So we did something about it."

02:34.229 --> 02:40.820
"We started cooking hot gourmet meals
on the job site using the tools of the trade:"

02:40.909 --> 02:46.699
"Me and the boys call this
'cooking a meal with power and steel'"

02:48.429 --> 02:51.259
This was an inspiring letter.
A very inspiring letter.

02:51.350 --> 02:56.340
So inspiring. I invited these guys from
K&B Construction down here to Tool Time

02:56.429 --> 03:00.419
to demonstrate
cooking a gourmet meal on the job site.

03:00.509 --> 03:04.179
So don't miss us next time
when we will do cooking with what?

03:04.269 --> 03:06.060
More power!

03:06.630 --> 03:09.419
You're right.
See you next time.

03:13.229 --> 03:16.620
Hey. Dad, they just vaporised
the whole building.

03:16.709 --> 03:19.820
- Did they get the general yet?
- Yeah, just now.

03:19.909 --> 03:25.300
I missed my favorite part - that's where
they suck the blood out of his head.

03:25.669 --> 03:29.370
You're not watching
Red Planet Death again?

03:30.550 --> 03:35.300
No, honey, no. This is
Madame Butterfly.' the Backstage Look.

03:37.630 --> 03:41.169
- What are you looking for?
- Jalapeño peppers.

03:46.870 --> 03:53.130
I'm going to make up some of that four-star
Happy Trails rootin'-tootin' chilli of mine.

03:53.229 --> 03:57.499
I don't know about the rootin'.
but there'll be plenty of tootin'.

03:57.590 --> 04:03.060
Just consider yourself lucky
I'm not making my rip-roarin' chilli.

04:03.150 --> 04:07.459
- Mom, look what I colored for you.
- Ohh!

04:07.550 --> 04:10.110
Honey, that's beautiful.

04:10.189 --> 04:12.900
That's some good-looking airplane.

04:12.989 --> 04:15.499
It's not an airplane. It's Mom.

04:17.070 --> 04:21.259
I… I thought those were propellers.

04:22.269 --> 04:24.259
They are.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.489
- We're going to the park.
- Can I come with you?

04:27.590 --> 04:30.620
- No. You're not coming with us.
- Hey, hey! Hold it there.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.380
There is no reason that
you can't take him with you.

04:33.469 --> 04:36.540
Mom, we don't want people to know
we have a geek for a brother.

04:36.630 --> 04:40.100
Brad, take your brother
to the park with you.

04:40.189 --> 04:41.780
All right.

04:41.870 --> 04:45.540
Get your coat, doofus.
We'll meet you out here.

04:46.550 --> 04:49.780
Jill, where is that Happy Trails
chilli cookbook of mine?

04:49.870 --> 04:53.060
Why do you need a cookbook? You're
just gonna dump in whatever you want.

04:53.150 --> 04:58.820
I want to throw the book in there. Maybe
those pages will soak up the extra oil.

04:58.909 --> 05:02.530
Mom. Brad and Randy left without me.

05:02.630 --> 05:07.179
Those little snakes. Here.
I'll take you to the park myself, honey.

05:07.269 --> 05:11.939
That's OK.
I'll just go upstairs and play with my trucks.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.979
What are we gonna do about Brad
and Randy? They keep tormenting Mark.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.850
That's why we had Mark.
So they'd leave us alone.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.900
You just don't know
the kind of things that they do to him.

05:31.989 --> 05:35.140
Like, a couple of days ago. I made him
a chunky peanut-butter sandwich.

05:35.229 --> 05:39.979
and they told him that the chunks
were ground-up rat bones.

05:40.070 --> 05:44.419
So? Older brothers torment younger
brothers. It's the way of the world.

05:44.509 --> 05:48.540
I did it to my younger brothers. This kid's
gotta learn how to deal with this by himself.

05:48.630 --> 05:54.620
I don't believe that older brothers have a
special privilege to be obnoxious little pigs.

05:57.070 --> 06:00.100
No. I think that you and I should
get together as a parental unit

06:00.189 --> 06:03.459
and have a nice long talk with
Brad and Randy about their behavior.

06:03.550 --> 06:07.090
These are kids without
central nervous systems, all right?

06:07.189 --> 06:11.219
- We have to learn to out-torment them.
- I see. Stoop to their level?

06:11.310 --> 06:13.140
Exactly.

06:13.229 --> 06:16.620
You want to teach
Brad and Randy a lesson?

06:19.590 --> 06:22.150
Tonight, when I'm cookin' that chilli.
I'll cut up this cauliflower.

06:22.229 --> 06:26.340
and we'll tell them
we've got rabbit brains in there.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.729
No, we're gonna talk to them.

06:28.830 --> 06:32.140
We'll tell them how much
they're hurting Mark's feelings

06:32.229 --> 06:34.530
and how much that behavior
disappoints us.

06:34.630 --> 06:37.860
And if that fails…

06:37.949 --> 06:40.860
old Peter Cottontail
hops right into that chilli.

06:42.030 --> 06:45.219
Come on. Mom.
We want to go back to the park.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.870
Boys, sit down.
Your mom has something to say to you.

06:47.949 --> 06:51.060
I believe that we have something
that we both want to say to them.

06:51.150 --> 06:52.130
Yeah, right.

06:52.229 --> 06:56.340
OK, whatever your mom is saying.
I'm saying it.

06:56.429 --> 07:01.449
Just she's the one saying it, which doesn't
mean I'm not saying what she's saying.

07:01.550 --> 07:04.140
Say what I'm saying.

07:06.070 --> 07:10.140
You guys promised Mark that
you would take him with you to the park.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.259
and then you ran off and left him here.

07:12.350 --> 07:16.300
- We waited in the yard. He never came.
- You waited five seconds.

07:16.390 --> 07:19.340
- You didn't say how long we had to wait.
- Don't get smart.

07:19.429 --> 07:21.540
Hey. I think you're missing the point here.

07:21.630 --> 07:25.580
We are a family.
If one of us is hurting, we're all hurting.

07:25.669 --> 07:30.790
If you hurt Mark's feelings, you hurt my
feelings and your father's feelings. Right?

07:30.870 --> 07:32.659
Right.

07:33.870 --> 07:38.810
And Tim. I think you have something
that you want to say here.

07:40.310 --> 07:43.380
- You guys like cauliflower?
- Tim!

07:43.469 --> 07:46.140
All right, all right, all right.

07:46.229 --> 07:50.860
However much fun you think it is to
torment your younger brother, it's wrong.

07:50.949 --> 07:57.179
But Dad, what about all those terrible
things you did to Uncle Steve?

07:57.269 --> 08:01.459
- He's your younger brother.
- Uncle Steve is a major pain in the…

08:01.550 --> 08:04.340
- This is different.
- Why?

08:04.429 --> 08:06.729
Because Steve knew I was kidding.
that's why.

08:06.830 --> 08:11.580
Well, then why doesn't he come
to any family reunions?

08:12.630 --> 08:15.620
- Because he lives so far away.
- No, he doesn't. He just lives…

08:15.709 --> 08:18.060
Hey, hey. You know…

08:18.150 --> 08:21.380
We're not talking about your Uncle Steve.
We're talking about you mo.

08:21.469 --> 08:23.019
That's right.

08:23.110 --> 08:27.540
And we want you to start treating Mark
the way that you would like to be treated.

08:27.630 --> 08:30.820
You know, that old golden-rule thing.

08:32.188 --> 08:34.419
OK. We're sorry.

08:34.509 --> 08:36.860
- Honey?
- Yeah?

08:36.948 --> 08:40.419
- What are you doing?
- Looking for something to put that chilli in.

08:40.509 --> 08:43.620
How about a trash bag?

08:43.708 --> 08:46.419
I'm looking for that big pot
we take on cookouts with us.

08:46.509 --> 08:51.219
Oh, OK. You know, I think that our talk
with Brad and Randy really helped.

08:51.310 --> 08:55.459
Cos they've been really nice to Mark
for almost an hour.

08:55.550 --> 08:57.499
Whoa!

08:57.590 --> 09:03.179
Look at this thing. That old strobe light
I had in my dormitory room.

09:06.749 --> 09:12.140
- Very groovy and far-out, man.
- And it wasn't even on half the time.

09:14.070 --> 09:15.259
Whoa!

09:15.350 --> 09:18.580
All these old eight-track tapes.

09:18.669 --> 09:20.340
"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"

09:20.429 --> 09:23.140
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby

09:23.229 --> 09:26.659
OK, smart guy.
Who sang "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"?

09:26.749 --> 09:29.179
I just was.
In-a-gadda-da-vida…

09:29.269 --> 09:33.019
Who sang "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"
so people wanted to hear it?

09:33.469 --> 09:35.179
You are an evil woman.

09:35.269 --> 09:40.019
"Evil Woman", sung by
Electric Light Orchestra, 1976.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.140
- Lucky guess.
- Luck! Not luck, skill.

09:43.229 --> 09:45.140
All right, brainiac.

09:45.229 --> 09:48.739
Who sang "Play That funky Music"?

09:48.830 --> 09:53.769
Wild Cherry. Also 1976.
Released on the Epic label.

09:53.870 --> 09:57.620
- Come on.
- "Come On". Tommy Roe, 1964.

09:57.709 --> 10:01.300
- Stop.
- In the name of love

10:01.390 --> 10:03.689
Supremes, 1965.

10:03.790 --> 10:10.179
Let's face it - when it comes to this song
title stuff. I am the high priestess of pop.

10:10.269 --> 10:12.860
- Well. I'm pretty good myself.
- Oh, yeah?

10:12.949 --> 10:16.179
Name the first song
that we ever slow-danced to.

10:16.269 --> 10:18.419
What?

10:18.509 --> 10:21.979
Name the first song
that we ever slow-danced to.

10:22.070 --> 10:25.300
- I'm waiting.
- Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.499
- We were at the Glitter Ballroom.
- Mm-hm.

10:28.590 --> 10:31.740
We were dancing close.
You had an angora sweater on.

10:31.829 --> 10:34.979
- doused in Shalimar or something.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:35.070 --> 10:38.740
I had just the right amount
of Jade East on.

10:38.829 --> 10:41.979
- Our bodies were pressed close.
- Tim, what was the name of the song?

10:42.070 --> 10:45.139
Did it have the words
"cold shower" in it?

10:45.229 --> 10:49.300
No. But if you think of the song.
I'll be upstairs.

10:50.389 --> 10:53.180
"Touch Me in the Morning". Diana Ross.

10:53.269 --> 10:58.660
I'll touch you in the afternoon
if you think of the name of the song.

11:00.189 --> 11:05.309
I remember the song that we heard in the
back of my Corvair steaming the windows.

11:07.189 --> 11:09.780
So do I. "The Minute Waltz."

11:12.829 --> 11:17.099
- Throw it to me.
- Forget it. You got us in trouble.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.340
Mom said you're supposed to
be nice to me.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.260
You see Mom anywhere in this back yard?

11:25.229 --> 11:26.979
Now get lost.

11:27.070 --> 11:30.820
But you've got to play with me.
We're brothers.

11:30.910 --> 11:33.539
We're not your brothers.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.820
Yes, you are.

11:36.910 --> 11:39.939
I'm gonna let you in on a secret.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.579
We're aliens from outer space.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.780
You're a big fat liar, Randy.

11:46.869 --> 11:49.059
My name isn't Randy.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.939
It's Zelnot.

11:52.950 --> 11:55.459
I'm Zorton.

11:56.309 --> 11:58.689
No, you're not.
You're Brad and Randy.

11:58.789 --> 12:00.380
No.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.050
Brad and Randy are gone.

12:07.030 --> 12:12.260
We sucked the blood out of their brains
and took over their bodies.

12:12.349 --> 12:14.700
We have many powers.

12:14.789 --> 12:17.090
We can read minds.

12:17.189 --> 12:19.180
No, you can't.

12:19.269 --> 12:21.260
I'll prove it.

12:22.590 --> 12:26.130
- Zorton.
- Talk to me. Zelnot.

12:29.309 --> 12:33.260
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten. What is it?

12:33.349 --> 12:35.579
- four.
- That's right.

12:37.749 --> 12:39.979
How'd you do that?

12:42.749 --> 12:45.499
I'm telling Mom and Dad.
You're in big trouble.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.180
Hey.

12:47.269 --> 12:50.059
They're not your mom and dad.

12:54.030 --> 12:56.019
They're aliens too.

12:56.869 --> 12:59.619
- Are not.
- Are too.

12:59.709 --> 13:02.010
Our spaceship's coming
to pick us up tonight.

13:02.110 --> 13:06.820
Yeah. And we're gonna leave you here
all alone for the rest of your life.

13:06.910 --> 13:10.300
- You don't scare me.
- Hold it.

13:10.389 --> 13:14.979
You better walk backwards
until after we leave tonight.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.419
Why?

13:16.510 --> 13:21.019
Because aliens can't suck your blood
if you're walking backwards.

13:21.110 --> 13:25.340
Yeah. Our real lips are
in the back of our heads.

13:51.269 --> 13:54.340
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

13:56.150 --> 13:59.419
Why are you walking backwards?
You could hurt yourself doing that.

13:59.510 --> 14:03.099
Better than getting
all my blood sucked out.

14:03.189 --> 14:07.900
- He's got a good point there.
- Have you been talking to your brothers?

14:07.990 --> 14:12.419
- What have they been telling you now?
- They said you're all from outer space.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.619
Honey, you know that's not true.

14:14.709 --> 14:20.099
Jill, sometimes you wake up
early in the morning, and you look…

14:23.309 --> 14:25.869
They said you have lips
in the back of your head.

14:25.950 --> 14:29.099
Jill, sometimes you wake up early…

14:31.349 --> 14:33.340
Mark, come here. Come here.

14:33.430 --> 14:37.209
Now. Look here.
Do you see any lips there?

14:37.309 --> 14:40.380
- Not really.
- There. See?

14:40.470 --> 14:44.499
You have got to stop
listening to those mo.

14:44.590 --> 14:47.820
Come here and give me a hug.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.380
You want to go and get yourself
some Earth juice?

14:51.470 --> 14:53.099
Yeah.

14:53.869 --> 14:56.430
Aliens. Those guys never stop.
I give up.

14:56.910 --> 15:01.220
It's time for the master tormentor
to take over.

15:01.309 --> 15:06.329
If you want to torment them.
you should just ground them with no TV.

15:06.430 --> 15:07.820
Ha!

15:08.869 --> 15:14.180
That would be a penalty for earthlings.
We need a penalty suitable for aliens.

15:14.269 --> 15:17.419
OK. I am behind you. I think.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.249
Are you gonna make
Brad and Randy say they're sorry?

15:20.349 --> 15:22.019
Well, you have mo choices.

15:22.110 --> 15:25.889
We could make them apologize
or we could get even.

15:27.990 --> 15:30.939
- Get even.
- That's my boy.

15:33.869 --> 15:36.430
Last time. I promised
construction-site cooking.

15:36.510 --> 15:40.019
That's why I invited the guys
at K8B construction down to the set.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.139
Rock Lannigan.

15:42.229 --> 15:45.539
Dwayne Hoover and Pete Bilker.
How you doing, Pete?

15:45.630 --> 15:47.820
- Hi, Tim.
- Nice beard.

15:47.910 --> 15:52.660
Thank you, Tim.
I grew it because of Al. He's my hero.

15:57.510 --> 16:00.220
Yeah, mine too.

16:00.309 --> 16:05.619
- Rock, what have you got for us today?
- I'm a riveter. I work up on the high steel.

16:05.709 --> 16:08.660
And. I'll tell you, it makes it darn hard
to get a hot lunch up there.

16:08.749 --> 16:12.660
But I've come up with an easy way to make
a delicious grilled-cheese sandwich.

16:12.749 --> 16:15.019
You hear my stomach growling?

16:15.110 --> 16:20.229
You're gonna love this one, Tim.
The fellas call it "cheddar ȧ la Rock".

16:20.309 --> 16:22.610
I use only sharp Wisconsin cheese.

16:22.709 --> 16:27.499
because, after all.
in Wisconsin, cheese is cheese.

16:27.590 --> 16:30.780
American cheese from American cows.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.180
Look out!

16:34.269 --> 16:40.340
I spread on a generous dollop
of oleo with my trowel.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.939
Then I take the cheese
and I stick it between the bread.

16:44.030 --> 16:46.380
Good place for it.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.769
And then I…

16:50.189 --> 16:53.139
Tim, I kind of hate
to give this little secret away.

16:53.229 --> 16:56.619
Come on, Rock, let it go.
It's a Tool Time crowd.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.220
All right, all right. Pete.

17:01.309 --> 17:04.700
I sprinkle on a little oregano
for flavoring.

17:05.669 --> 17:08.459
- And then I fire it up.
- What do you use to heat that with?

17:08.550 --> 17:13.819
That's one of the secrets of cooking on
the job site. I go straight for my blowtorch.

17:13.910 --> 17:17.138
And that's no ordinary blowtorch.

17:17.229 --> 17:21.138
That's a Binford 3000
Turbo Ignition Switch torch.

17:21.229 --> 17:23.220
You betcha, Tim.

17:25.348 --> 17:31.979
See, the trick - you got to toast it
nice and evenly on both sides

17:32.070 --> 17:35.380
so that you seal in
that delicious Wisconsin flavor.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.459
Try that, Timmy.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.340
It's hot.

17:46.430 --> 17:50.700
Might want to let that cheese
cool down a little bit there.

17:52.550 --> 17:55.180
Thanks, Al.
Dwayne, what do you have for us?

17:55.269 --> 17:58.660
You know. I'm out on the job site, way out.

17:58.749 --> 18:01.459
nowhere close to
your ordinary kitchen utensils.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.740
So I got to improvise.

18:03.829 --> 18:10.090
Now, this here is the dipstick
off my '87 mo-ton pickup.

18:10.189 --> 18:15.099
With this. I make my southern specialty.
shish-ke-billy-bob.

18:17.189 --> 18:18.539
Now..

18:18.630 --> 18:24.539
The important thing to remember, Tim,
before you start cooking.

18:24.630 --> 18:28.249
is to get all that oil off your dipstick.

18:29.550 --> 18:34.139
Now… I like to alternate
my meat and my vegetables.

18:35.389 --> 18:40.780
- How do you feel about that, Al?
- I'm still thinking about that dipstick, Tim.

18:42.189 --> 18:45.939
I prefer to use USDA Choice cube steak.

18:46.030 --> 18:49.019
pearl onions, green peppers.

18:49.110 --> 18:52.939
and just a touch of
summer squash for Color.

18:53.470 --> 18:56.780
No need to make mealtime
a drab affair, huh, Tim?

18:58.349 --> 19:00.059
Perish that thought. Dwayne.

19:00.150 --> 19:04.780
Now, for the seasoning.
I turn to my assistant. Pete.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.099
That would be me.

19:08.630 --> 19:13.260
I like to lightly dust the kebab with…

19:14.910 --> 19:19.139
just a hint of sage
and some tarragon.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.849
- Well. I prefer rosemary, but…
- Dwayne, rosemary's much too harsh…

19:23.950 --> 19:27.099
Pete, this is neither
the time nor the place.

19:32.550 --> 19:38.860
Now, ordinarily, Tim, I would wrap this
in tinfoil and put it on a hot engine.

19:38.950 --> 19:42.260
But we don't have time for all that.
Hold that, Al, will you? Thank you.

19:42.349 --> 19:48.340
Now. Pete's got one… Pete's got one
all cooked up and ready for us to taste.

19:48.430 --> 19:51.700
- There you go, Tim.
- Give that a whirl.

19:54.799 --> 19:57.630
Yeah. How do you like that?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.630
This is delicious.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.339
I detect a hint of 10W-30
on that thing, though.

20:13.599 --> 20:16.710
- Dad. Dad, Brad and Randy are coming.
- All right, son. All right.

20:16.799 --> 20:20.470
The master tormentor is ready to
teach them a lesson they'll never forget.

20:20.559 --> 20:25.029
The spaceship will be here any minute.
You know the plan. Get out of here. Go, go!

20:25.119 --> 20:27.029
OK, this is gonna be great.

20:27.119 --> 20:32.269
First we'll get him down on his knees,
then we'll get him to close his eyes,

20:32.359 --> 20:35.869
then we'll sneak back in the house
and lock him out.

20:35.960 --> 20:40.390
Look, he's out there waiting for us.
What a geek.

20:44.279 --> 20:46.990
Mr Zelnot, where's the spaceship?

20:49.119 --> 20:52.390
- It'll be here in mo minutes.
- You have to wait over here.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.990
And remember, when your mom and dad
come out, say goodbye real fast.

20:57.079 --> 20:59.829
But don't hug them.
or your arms will melt.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.460
Yeah. Now get down on your knees
and close your eyes.

21:03.559 --> 21:09.349
And whatever you do, don't move.
or your skull will cave in.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.940
- What is it?
- I don't know.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.869
The other door.

21:42.519 --> 21:44.819
Help. Mom! Let us in!

21:52.640 --> 21:54.190
Well…

21:54.279 --> 22:00.269
I think the master tormentor has done his
job. And now I have a little surprise for you.

22:10.599 --> 22:12.630
You remembered.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.150
- Harry Nilsson. "Without You".
- That's right.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.829
I'd be a whole lot happier.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.910
I'm just kidding.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.390
The master tormentor
is now the master rememberer.

22:26.480 --> 22:30.470
Tell me something. Did you do all of this to
teach them a lesson, or just cos it was fun?

22:30.559 --> 22:33.910
- What do you think?
- I don't think they learned a thing.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.940
I think you're wrong. I think those boys
learned a valuable lesson.

22:39.039 --> 22:42.910
They won't be messing with anybody
for a long time.

22:45.559 --> 22:47.940
Back to bed, boys.

22:51.839 --> 22:55.539
Those kids look a lot like
your side of the family.
