WEBVTT

01:51.862 --> 01:52.947
I need money.

01:53.155 --> 01:57.618
Yes, it is a lovely morning, isn't it?
Sun is shining, the birds are chirping.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.871
Only dentist I know who
can't make money.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.457
Oh, really? What about her father?

02:03.916 --> 02:06.877
As a dentist,
my husband was very successful.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.711
It was just that other stuff.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.258
Yes. There's a word for that other stuff.
It's called embezzlement.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.637
Speaking of which,
how much do you need, dear?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.639
Five should probably do it.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.307
Thousand? For what?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.688
You know what?
Your father would be proud.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.899
I'll see what I can do.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.819
In the meantime,
you ladies have a lovely day.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.115
I would, if you'd do me a favor and die.

Excuse me. Are you threatening me?

05:00.759 --> 05:01.969
I didn't think so. Look,

05:02.970 --> 05:06.348
I changed my mind, okay?
Yes, I'll get you your money back.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.690
Morning, doctor.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.946
Okay. Good news, Monsieur Boulez.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.699
Not gonna have to pull the tooth.
All we have to do is drill.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.535
- No drill.
- No drill?

05:26.744 --> 05:29.121
No drill. I hate the drill.

05:29.330 --> 05:33.125
So you just gas me, pull the tooth out,
and we'll still be friends. Okay?

05:33.834 --> 05:37.212
- Good.
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.661
I want a hamburger and fries.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.929
- Okay. I'm gonna have a hamburger
- Mm-hm.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.348
with no mayonnaise this time.

05:47.556 --> 05:51.393
- No mayonnaise?
- No mayonnaise. Not at all. Okay?

05:52.686 --> 05:56.106
- She's gonna put mayonnaise on it.
- Do you mind if I say something?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.484
Leave the bitch.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.571
- Excuse me?
- Your wife. Leave her.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.823
Find somebody else
and just start over.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.618
- Jill...
- Oz, I know it's none of my business.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.829
I know I've only been working for you
for three weeks.

06:11.038 --> 06:15.459
But I'm just telling you what I see, mister.
Your wife is not a good person.

06:16.168 --> 06:19.296
- You're expecting an argument?
- Why do you torture yourself?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.882
- Just divorce her.
- I can't afford to.

06:22.091 --> 06:25.260
She'd take me to the cleaners.
I'm already paying her father's debt.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.097
So she's gonna ride it out
till Daddy's debt gets paid.

06:28.305 --> 06:32.101
- She's just charming, isn't she?
- She can't help it. Her mother...

06:32.643 --> 06:34.269
What's a nice way of...?

06:34.478 --> 06:37.564
Her mother is... She...
Well, she's the Antichrist.

06:38.273 --> 06:41.985
You know, you'd be doing the world
a favor if you'd just have her whacked.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.448
You know somebody who'd do this?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.450
Present company excluded?

06:48.659 --> 06:50.661
- Voilà.
<i>- Merci.</i>

06:50.869 --> 06:53.705
Hypothetically?
Or do you want me to name a price?

06:53.872 --> 06:56.667
Well, you should talk to my wife.
You'd make a fortune.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.711
- What makes you say that?
- Life insurance.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.839
I'm worth more dead than alive.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.903
That one. Good.

07:27.239 --> 07:31.285
Yeah, just dining room.
Take the plastic junk off of there.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.246
Can you move
any slower than this, fellas?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.457
Hi. You must be our new neighbor.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.750
I'm Nicholas Oseransky. Call me Oz.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.212
Jimmy.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.173
- Hi.
- Jimmy Jones.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.718
- Have we met before?
- No.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.303
Are you sure?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.930
Yeah. I'd remember.
I got a thing with faces.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.516
That is so weird. You look so familiar.
Where are you from?

07:54.683 --> 07:57.060
Mr. Jones, where do you want this?

07:57.936 --> 08:00.772
Um...

08:12.409 --> 08:14.203
<i>Order! Order!</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:29.551
Um... Upstairs, back bedroom.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.220
What were you saying?

08:35.807 --> 08:37.768
- You all right?
- Yes.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.688
You sure? Because you look
like you got some gas.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.984
Well, I had a hamburger for lunch.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.612
- They put mayonnaise on it?
- Yes.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.156
Can you tell me why they do that?

08:51.532 --> 08:54.409
Every red-blooded American knows
the only condiment

08:54.618 --> 08:58.413
you are ever supposed to put
on a hamburger is ketchup!

08:59.915 --> 09:03.502
Or maybe some of that special sauce
you like so much here in Canada!

09:03.669 --> 09:05.796
Which has a little mayonnaise in it too.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.883
I swear to God, when they slop that
mayonnaise on, I could kill somebody.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.219
I really, really didn't wanna upset you.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.598
Heh. Who's upset?
I'm just having a conversation here.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.688
- I'm gonna go home.
- Okay.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.856
- Feel better.
- Thank you.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.653
- Oz.
- Yes!

09:32.197 --> 09:34.032
Thanks for stopping by,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.368
welcoming me to the neighborhood.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.120
Okay.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.257
Pack up! Pack up! We're leaving!

09:50.465 --> 09:52.301
Jesus!

09:54.886 --> 09:57.764
Jesus! I just bumped
into our new next-door neighbor.

09:57.973 --> 10:01.393
- Any idea who that is?
- I suppose you're going to tell me.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.937
That's Jimmy "the Tulip" Tudeski.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.397
And that means something?

10:05.606 --> 10:08.066
Jimmy the Tulip was a hit man
for the Gogolak gang.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.860
Yes, baby. Yes.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.864
The Gogolak gang. The Hungarian gang
back in Chicago that ran the north side?

10:14.031 --> 10:17.701
That guy, Jimmy, right over there,
was Lazlo Gogolak's key enforcer.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.005
Sexy.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.841
Sophie, the man's killed 17 people.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.092
Why the stupid name?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.637
"The Tulip"?
That's his flower of choice.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.483
It's what he sent
to his victims' funerals.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.267
- I wonder what he's doing here.
- Well, hiding out.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.144
He ratted out Lazlo Gogolak.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.605
Now Lazlo's spending his life in prison.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.190
Jimmy only got five years.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.651
Dave told me
he refused witness protection.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.736
Protection? From...?

10:52.944 --> 10:55.864
I'm sure Lazlo's son, Janni,
wants to put one of those...

10:56.073 --> 10:58.784
You know, the... A price on his head.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.952
You mean a contract?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.205
A mob contract?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.545
Mm.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.985
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.987
Good. Let's go for a drive.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.490
- A drive? Why?
- Yeah, a drive.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.368
Well, I don't know anyone else in town.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.787
I figured we could go for a drive.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.748
You could show me the sights,
you know.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.583
It won't kill you.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.669
Promise?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.716
- So I take it you're not Canadian.
- Only by marriage.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.177
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.431
Not "Chicago" Chicago.

12:02.639 --> 12:06.643
I was born there, but I don't really know
anything about Chicago anymore.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.063
Okay.

12:10.188 --> 12:13.650
Yeah, totally oblivious
to anything even related to Chicago.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.863
- I'm from Jersey.
- New Jersey?

12:19.156 --> 12:21.074
Yeah. New Jersey.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.452
If you're from Jersey,
you're from Jersey.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.414
Jersey's another place
I know absolutely nothing about.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.629
- You always this nervous?
- Yes.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.467
Like virtually everything else
that's wrong in my life,

12:38.675 --> 12:40.844
- it all started with the little missus.
- Heh.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.473
See, back home, her father and I
ran a dental practice together.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.769
- You're a dentist?
- Afraid so.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.355
- You suicidal?
- See, now, why would you say that?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.776
I once read
that dentists are prone to suicide.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.988
Look, Jimmy, I may hate my life,
but I certainly don't wanna die.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.200
You better get used to it
because you're going to.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.286
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna strangle you!

13:09.247 --> 13:10.916
Everybody dies.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.336
Sooner or later.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.588
- Tulip?
- No!

13:18.882 --> 13:21.343
So you were saying,
your father-in-law...

13:21.551 --> 13:24.012
Well, ironically, he was a suicide.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.305
Stats don't lie.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.058
- He got caught molesting a patient.
- Ugh.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.810
An underage patient.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.645
- An underage male patient.
- Aw...

13:31.812 --> 13:34.147
- Please, stop.
- I know.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.358
So this kid starts to blackmail him.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.403
This is the exact same time the IRS decides
to investigate him for tax fraud.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.405
So big Aaron needs money, and fast.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.283
So he goes to a...
You know, a loan shark,

13:45.492 --> 13:49.663
takes out a sizable loan against our company,
which I had no idea about.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.374
- And then proceeds to...
- Hit Vegas, Atlantic City, Reno.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.961
Loses all the money
and sticks you with the bill. Am I right?

13:56.837 --> 13:58.797
You are right. That's exactly right.

14:00.257 --> 14:05.053
So, you know, after the ensuing scandal
and bankruptcy and embarrassment,

14:05.262 --> 14:10.016
my wife and her mother decided
it would be best that we move back here.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.601
You like living in Canada?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.396
No, I live here with my wife.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.986
You sure you're a dentist?

14:21.862 --> 14:25.073
- Yeah, why?
- Because I've never met a dentist I liked.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.785
Well, I try to keep things
as painless as possible.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.371
Me too.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.051
Hey.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.347
It's been good.
I'm glad we got to know each other.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.184
You know what? Me too.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.147
- You can go now.
- Great.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.234
- Oz!
- Yes, dear?

15:01.484 --> 15:02.986
Thank God you're home.

15:03.194 --> 15:06.197
- Thank God I'm home?
- I had an idea.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.992
I figured out a way
we can pay off Daddy's debt.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.827
You're getting a job.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.495
- No.
- No.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.707
Our new neighbor.
You said there was a price on his head?

15:15.916 --> 15:18.835
That's your plan?
You're gonna murder our neighbor?

15:19.377 --> 15:22.505
Here's what you're going to do.
You're going to Chicago,

15:22.714 --> 15:26.551
you're going to find out who it is
who's offering this price on his head.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.802
Jimmy Tudeski's head?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.597
Then you're going to tell them
you know where he is

15:30.764 --> 15:33.016
after you negotiate a finder's fee.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.852
A finder's fee on a murder contract.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.438
- Is there a problem?
- Other than the fact

15:38.647 --> 15:41.066
that would make me a party to a murder?

15:41.858 --> 15:44.110
But he's a killer. You said so yourself.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.113
That's another good
reason not to do it. Okay?

15:47.322 --> 15:50.492
He's been to prison,
he's paid his debt to society.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.036
Well, now he can pay our debt too.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.873
All right, look,
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.876
but I spent some time
with the guy today, and he's...

16:00.043 --> 16:01.670
He's pretty nice, you know.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.838
Besides, he hasn't done anything to me.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.717
- He came on to me.
- What?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.260
He came on to me!

16:09.469 --> 16:12.222
- That animal, he made a pass at me!
- When?

16:13.890 --> 16:16.226
Earlier. This morning.
Before you came home.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.812
He sa... He said
you guys haven't even met.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.107
Who are you going to believe?
A contract killer or your wife?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.191
Do I have to answer that?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.985
- Nicolas!
- Okay, okay.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.571
Let's say that he did
make a pass at you.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.980
The guy's been in prison for five years.
He's desperate.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.826
He'd sleep with a meat grinder.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.329
You pig! You disgust me!

16:36.413 --> 16:39.040
There's a known killer
living right next door

16:39.207 --> 16:42.585
who might slaughter us in our sleep,
and you won't even lift a finger!

16:42.794 --> 16:46.673
That's right. I'm not gonna lift a finger
because this is crazy.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.187
You do this for me...

17:03.148 --> 17:04.898
and I give you your divorce.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.320
Hm? And if you don't do
this for me, I swear

17:10.530 --> 17:12.574
I'll make your life
so damned miserable,

17:12.906 --> 17:15.952
it'll make these past few years
seem like a pleasure cruise.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.622
I already booked your flight.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.958
You leave tomorrow at 9 a.m.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.835
You better start packing.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.297
Ho-ho-hew. Bing! Zoom!

17:34.387 --> 17:35.827
<i>Okay. When are you coming back?</i>

17:36.514 --> 17:38.600
I have to reschedule
all your appointments.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.408
Shouldn't be more than a couple of days.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.687
- Are you going alone?
<i>- Yes.</i>

17:42.896 --> 17:45.607
Good. Can you do me a huge favor
while you're there?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.901
Go out and get laid.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.819
Jill.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.988
Call me the second you get back.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.658
Better yet, call me right after.
Call me during. I want all the details.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.378
Now, don't expect too much.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.298
I'm not even sure I'll be able
to contact these people.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.552
It's not as if the Gogolaks
have a 1-800 number or anything.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.721
I know you'll do what you can.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.895
- What is this?
- Good luck, my darling.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.731
And hurry home.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.028
Do they have vomit bags on the flight?

19:00.265 --> 19:03.184
You're Jimmy Tudeski, aren't you?
Jimmy the Tulip?

19:06.187 --> 19:09.816
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me, sexy.

19:10.024 --> 19:14.237
But you will never believe
what my darling husband is up to.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.587
You're back in Chicago?

19:30.920 --> 19:36.176
Great. Tell you what, meet me
at Ekins Oyster Bar in 45 minutes.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.766
Dave, you got nothing to worry about.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.018
How can I not worry?

19:45.226 --> 19:48.563
You tell me you're back in Chicago
to rat Tudeski out to Janni...

19:48.730 --> 19:51.566
But I'm not going to rat him out.
You think I'm suicidal?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.234
Well, you are a dentist.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.864
Look, I have no intention
of ratting anybody out, okay?

19:58.031 --> 20:01.591
The only reason I'm here is because I want
Sophie off my back if you wanna know the truth.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.662
All right, look, I've got a deadline.
I'll come by your hotel room

20:04.871 --> 20:08.124
as soon as I'm finished. In the meantime,
promise me you won't do anything stupid.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.794
- Now, why would you even say that?
- You married Sophie, didn't you?

20:13.004 --> 20:14.422
So I'll get the check then?

20:30.438 --> 20:33.942
- I'm sorry. I must have the wrong...
- What room you looking for?

20:35.735 --> 20:36.903
Five-nineteen.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.239
You're in the right place.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.907
You Nicholas Oseransky?

20:43.159 --> 20:45.995
- Who are you?
- We understand you have information

20:46.204 --> 20:48.790
regarding the whereabouts
of Jimmy the Tulip.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.252
- Who told you that? Dave?
- Who's Dave?

20:52.460 --> 20:53.711
What did he tell you?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.088
Forget about Dave.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.924
For our immediate purposes,
there is no Dave.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.968
Dave does not exist.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.471
So just answer my question.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.431
Do you or don't you?

21:07.475 --> 21:10.728
Have information regarding
the whereabouts of Jimmy the Tulip?

21:12.230 --> 21:15.483
- I don't know what you're talking about, man.
- Really?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.072
Then I must have been misinformed.

21:22.532 --> 21:23.574
I apologize.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.118
It's okay.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.417
Now, let's try this again.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.419
We understand

21:34.627 --> 21:37.714
- you have information regarding...
- Who told you that?

21:37.922 --> 21:41.384
Why do you wanna go cluttering
your mind with the inconsequential?

21:41.592 --> 21:46.514
What's important is we know
that you know where Jimmy Tudeski is.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.641
Look, I really have no...

21:51.185 --> 21:52.603
Aren't you gonna cry out for help?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.522
- Would it do any good?
- No.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.359
- Who are you?
- Franklin Figueroa.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.987
A.k.a. Frankie Figs.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.655
I work for Janni Gogolak.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.699
Oh, my God.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.244
So, where's Jimmy?

22:08.453 --> 22:09.579
Look, I sw...

22:11.247 --> 22:15.752
My brother, believe me,
you don't wanna dance with me all night.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.171
And for a scumbag like Jimmy T?

22:18.379 --> 22:19.964
Save yourself the pain.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.301
Look, I really have no...

22:23.509 --> 22:25.136
Oh, no, no, no!

22:26.763 --> 22:28.389
I may know where he is.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.101
Well, all right. But don't tell me.
Let's go tell Janni.

22:32.310 --> 22:35.021
Okay.
You mind if I piss a little blood first?

22:35.229 --> 22:37.398
- Please, by all means.
- Thanks.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.266
My father...

23:13.851 --> 23:15.144
is a great man.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.691
A man of vision and...

23:23.778 --> 23:24.779
character.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.950
A man who stood up for his beliefs.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.789
Unlike that rat-fuck...

23:36.332 --> 23:38.167
piece of shit...

23:39.001 --> 23:40.336
Tudeski.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.675
Can you...

23:49.095 --> 23:51.722
ask Cynthia to join us, please?

23:57.353 --> 23:59.397
- You want a drink?
- Oh, no, thanks.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.358
- Have a drink.
- I'll have a Scotch and soda, please.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.364
I want you to understand,
Frankie explained to me

24:08.573 --> 24:11.576
you're having a problem
with your conscience.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.786
Yes, well, it's just that
none of this was my idea.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.706
You think it was mine? No.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.209
If I had my way, my father

24:20.418 --> 24:24.130
would still be running things
and I'd be somewhere like, uh...

24:25.047 --> 24:26.757
I don't know. Um...

24:34.015 --> 24:37.685
- Aruba.
- Actually, Aruba's not that nice.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.732
- Excuse me?
- You may like it.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.819
See, I honeymooned there,
and that's probably why I didn't like it.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.780
The thing you gotta remember is

24:49.864 --> 24:52.575
when we're talking about Jimmy Tudeski,

24:52.783 --> 24:55.703
we're not talking about a human being.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.081
We're talking about a rodent.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.542
We're talking about...

25:03.211 --> 25:04.420
wermin.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.557
- Where was I?
- Wermin. I think wermin.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.852
We're talking about someone... Screw that!

25:21.270 --> 25:22.855
Something...

25:23.481 --> 25:25.858
that doesn't deserve to be breathing...

25:27.026 --> 25:28.277
the air.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.656
Janni, talking about yourself again?

25:33.616 --> 25:35.284
Mr. Oseransky...

25:36.202 --> 25:38.204
this is Cynthia.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.336
Jimmy's wife.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.598
- Cynthia, it seems that Mr...
- Doctor.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.518
Excuse me?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.688
Dr. Oseransky. He's a dentist.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.022
Whatever.

26:05.231 --> 26:10.069
It seems that our dentist friend here
knows where Jimmy is.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.445
Oh.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.448
- Come to collect on the contract?
- No.

26:14.532 --> 26:18.619
Janni, just so you know, since I'm the one
that found this guy, I want it.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.581
- The contract's mine.
- Just as long as I'm in on the kill.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.332
So long as I get full price.

26:23.541 --> 26:27.295
I wanna see that spineless rat beg.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.298
Money doesn't matter.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.635
Well, now I've heard everything.
Don't you believe it.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.054
This one? Kill you for a quarter.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.642
Mr. Oseransky,

26:42.476 --> 26:45.438
Frankie will accompany you
back to Canada.

26:45.813 --> 26:49.692
You will lead him to the man
you believe is Jimmy Tudeski.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.320
- But, sir...
- Frankie, you'll let me know?

26:52.695 --> 26:54.322
All right then.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.825
Uh, Mr... Mr. Gogolak.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.830
My wife would make my life
even more miserable

27:03.039 --> 27:05.666
than it already is
if I didn't at least ask.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.882
Is there gonna be any kind
of finder's fee for this?

27:18.471 --> 27:19.513
Finder's fee?

27:37.365 --> 27:38.658
I tell you what.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.328
Tell your wife
we'll work something out.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.464
Cynthia, don't rush off.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.675
We should chat a little.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.975
I'll call you in the morning.
We'll leave first thing.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.357
Doctor. You're not gonna do
anything stupid

28:11.565 --> 28:14.402
- like try leaving me in the lurch, are you?
- No.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.658
- What did you do? Who did you talk to?
- What are you talking about?

28:20.866 --> 28:23.285
- You know a guy named Frankie Figs?
<i>- I know of him.</i>

28:23.369 --> 28:26.706
Yeah, well, when I came back from lunch,
he was sitting in my room.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.041
- Frankie Figs was in your room?
<i>- Yes.</i>

28:29.250 --> 28:31.752
And somehow he knew all about
my knowing where Jimmy is.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.964
<i>- And what did he do?</i>
- After he played congas on my kidneys,

28:35.172 --> 28:38.426
- he took me to see Janni Gogolak.
- Oz, tell me you're kidding me.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.345
Who did you tell?
I wanna know exactly who you told.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.889
- No one, I swear.
- Well, then, how...?

28:46.434 --> 28:48.394
What am I gonna do?

28:49.478 --> 28:51.230
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go.

29:11.751 --> 29:15.087
<i>- Room service.</i>
- Yes, this is Dr. Oseransky in Room 519.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.506
I'm gonna need
a bigger bottle of Scotch.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.563
- Yeah.
- It's me.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.107
Oz. How you doing?

29:35.316 --> 29:36.400
I don't know what to do.

29:36.609 --> 29:39.649
- I've done something terrible.
- Ah, come on. Oz, what could be so terrible?

29:39.820 --> 29:42.782
<i>You've gotta get out of town, get out
of Canada. Just get the hell out.</i>

29:42.990 --> 29:46.327
<i>- I'm in... I'm in Chicago.</i>
- Yeah, I heard about that.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.037
Have you seen Janni yet?

29:50.915 --> 29:54.084
- How did you know that?
- Heh. Relax.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.630
I know about the whole thing, okay?
Don't worry.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.256
- But...
<i>- I'll explain everything</i>

29:59.340 --> 30:01.383
to you when you get back, okay?

30:01.592 --> 30:03.219
In the meantime,

30:03.427 --> 30:06.347
I want you to have a good time
while you're down there. Live it up.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.183
- No, but what...
- We'll talk when you get back.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.227
<i>If you say so, Jim...</i>

30:47.221 --> 30:49.640
Are you gonna invite me in
or am I going downstairs

30:49.849 --> 30:51.809
and tell Janni's guys
you're being impolite?

30:52.393 --> 30:54.228
Janni's guys are downstairs?

30:54.770 --> 30:55.980
Yes, come in.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.406
I love a man with manners.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.291
Janni sent me to see if you were
on the level. Janni's the trusting type.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.002
So do you or don't you?

31:19.003 --> 31:20.379
Do I or don't I...?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.549
Know where my wayward husband is.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.260
Mrs. Tudeski...

31:26.343 --> 31:28.613
Cynthia. Why be formal with a woman
you're about to widow?

31:28.637 --> 31:31.223
- You don't understand.
- What's not to understand?

31:31.432 --> 31:34.518
You want your 30 pieces of silver, right?
My question is

31:34.727 --> 31:37.187
- why didn't you just do the job?
- Why didn't I...?

31:37.688 --> 31:40.691
Why didn't you kill Jimmy
and try to collect on the contract?

31:41.191 --> 31:44.028
What's the matter?
You didn't have the stomach for it?

31:44.612 --> 31:47.531
Or is your problem
a little further south?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.494
- Have you vomited recently?
- A minute ago.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.871
I was just gonna brush my teeth.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.581
- I'll wait.
- Okay.

31:56.790 --> 32:00.628
Mrs. Tudeski.
Cynthia, none of this was my idea.

32:00.836 --> 32:04.381
You just happened to travel a thousand
miles to rat Jimmy out to Janni.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.968
No. See, that's what I'm trying to say.
It was my wife's plan.

32:08.177 --> 32:10.804
She wanted me to come to Chicago
and rat Jimmy out.

32:12.181 --> 32:15.392
Look, maybe it would be best
for everybody if you went to Janni

32:15.601 --> 32:18.979
and said that I'm crazy, I've gone nuts.
I'm chemically imbalanced.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.773
I'm wacko.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.776
Maybe that would be the best thing.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.402
Because...

32:33.160 --> 32:36.246
Just tell him I'm acting
exactly the way I'm acting right now.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.208
But you do know where Jimmy is,
don't you?

32:41.627 --> 32:45.172
Look, Mrs. Tudeski,
I don't want anybody to die.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.466
And that is on the level.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.848
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

32:58.936 --> 33:00.896
I just want this all to end.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.198
I am so damn scared.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.580
Uh, that's room service.
Before I vomited, I ordered Scotch.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.127
There you go.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.045
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.092
What would you say to a drink?

33:32.594 --> 33:35.556
I'd say no ice, no water, in a tall glass.

33:36.558 --> 33:38.350
What can I say? I was young.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.978
Jimmy was like no man I'd ever met before.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.189
Yeah, well,
he's the first killer I've known.

33:45.149 --> 33:48.652
No one like him at my daddy's
country club. Lousy husband, though.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.612
Cheated on me constantly.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.365
- So why didn't you just...?
- Divorce him?

33:54.450 --> 33:57.661
Jimmy doesn't believe in divorce.
Thinks it's a sin.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.332
I know. A hit man with morals. Go figure.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.960
So now that he's out of prison,

34:05.169 --> 34:07.254
are you guys gonna get back together?

34:07.463 --> 34:10.299
You mean assuming Frankie and Janni
don't kill him first?

34:11.341 --> 34:12.467
No.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.636
Jimmy and I are over.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.389
And even if I wanted to make
another go of it, which I don't,

34:18.599 --> 34:21.268
there'd always be that other thing
between us.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.770
What other thing?

34:25.230 --> 34:28.192
- The fact that he wants to kill me.
- Why?

34:30.027 --> 34:32.446
You're a sweet guy. Money.

34:32.862 --> 34:37.242
- Oh. Are... Are... Are you rich?
- The money Lazlo Gogolak gave us

34:37.451 --> 34:40.788
as a wedding present.
Only it wasn't a wedding present.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.554
Lazlo was just parking the money
with us to hide it from the feds.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.585
- How much was it?
- Ten million dollars.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.005
Hell of a parking space.

34:50.214 --> 34:53.717
The only way anyone could get the money
was if Jimmy and Janni and I

34:53.926 --> 34:55.677
all signed for it together.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.890
If you didn't have all three signatures,
you'd need two signatures.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.017
And a death certificate.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.437
- Or one signature and...
- Two death certificates.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.975
That's why Jimmy wants to kill you,
if he kills you...

35:09.024 --> 35:12.111
- Let's not forget about Janni.
- ...then he gets the money. All of it.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.695
The whole nine yards.

35:17.658 --> 35:20.244
What if you just told him
you didn't want the money?

35:22.830 --> 35:27.626
I did tell him. I don't want a dime. But he
knows I don't wanna be married anymore

35:27.709 --> 35:29.169
and he doesn't believe in divorce.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.172
- But murder he's okay with?
- It's what he does.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.592
Well, if it was me,
10 million wouldn't be enough.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.595
So how much would it take
for you to kill your wife?

35:39.972 --> 35:42.307
- I'm talking about you.
- Me then. Your price?

35:42.516 --> 35:45.727
That's what I'm saying. I think
you are the most beautiful thing

35:45.811 --> 35:49.648
I have ever seen in my life,
and I cannot believe I am saying this out loud.

35:49.857 --> 35:53.527
- I'm sure that's just the Scotch talking.
- No, it's me.

35:56.822 --> 36:00.993
I've spent the last seven years of my life
just waiting for something to happen.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.870
I didn't even know what it was.

36:05.247 --> 36:08.292
Until you walked in that room
at Janni Gogolak's house.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.964
I'm sorry. Oh, I've embarrassed you.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.340
- I should go.
- No.

36:15.549 --> 36:16.884
Please.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.345
You're a nice guy,

36:21.263 --> 36:22.347
but I've gotta go.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.350
Let's go.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.948
You know, the night's still young.
You boys in any rush to get back?

36:45.621 --> 36:47.247
Did you mean what you said?

36:51.627 --> 36:52.836
I've got till midnight.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.297
In the meantime...

37:07.100 --> 37:09.019
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.479
You'll go slow.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.398
- I haven't made love in five years.
- Neither have I.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.485
I've been married.

37:30.791 --> 37:32.334
It's almost time.

37:34.378 --> 37:35.712
Again?

37:36.088 --> 37:38.131
What, did you have oysters for lunch?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.800
Actually, I did.

37:45.514 --> 37:46.848
Jimmy knows I'm here.

37:47.557 --> 37:49.726
- Here with me?
- Here in Chicago.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.436
Talking with Janni.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.773
How? How did he know that?

37:56.608 --> 37:58.402
- Because I told him.
- You what?

37:58.610 --> 37:59.653
He already knew.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.364
- How?
- Well, I'm guessing my darling wife.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.616
- Is she trying to get you killed?
- Apparently.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.340
That's the only thing I can come up with.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.870
But when I talked to Jimmy, he...

38:10.330 --> 38:12.457
- He didn't sound upset.
- No, he wouldn't.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.294
He'd be your best friend
right up until the moment he...

38:17.838 --> 38:19.548
He's gonna kill me, isn't he?

38:20.966 --> 38:23.635
And then, when he's done with that,
he's gonna come after you.

38:23.844 --> 38:25.429
I'm not gonna let that happen.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.224
I'm not gonna let Jimmy kill you.
I'm gonna take Frankie to Canada

38:29.308 --> 38:31.160
- and lead him to Jimmy.
- So Frankie can kill him.

38:31.184 --> 38:34.521
Believe me, if there was any other way,
but better Jimmy than you, right?

38:34.688 --> 38:37.482
But, Oz, don't you get it?
Either way, I'm dead.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.652
- Why? Why?
- As soon as Jimmy's dead,

38:40.861 --> 38:42.988
why would Janni wanna keep me alive?

38:43.405 --> 38:45.532
- He'd wanna kill me too so...
- So he can collect

38:45.741 --> 38:47.909
on the whole $10 million.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.748
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

38:53.457 --> 38:56.251
I swear, I am not gonna
let anybody kill you.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.965
Under the circumstances, that's probably
the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.508
Thanks. Ahem.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.326
You what?

39:29.534 --> 39:30.702
You told Jimmy?

39:30.911 --> 39:32.704
What the hell did you do that for?

39:32.913 --> 39:35.999
I felt bad. I like him. I liked him.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.978
- So you don't like him no more?
- A little hard to maintain a friendship

39:39.002 --> 39:42.672
- with somebody who wants to kill you.
- If you sold my ass out, then told me about it,

39:42.756 --> 39:45.884
- I'd wanna ice your ass too.
- I know.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.680
- You know, I can close that gap for you.
- Really?

39:50.764 --> 39:53.767
- You'd be in and out. No, not a problem.
- You're kidding.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.895
So did you do it?
Did you do what I told you to do?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.772
No. No, I'm not gonna answer that.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.399
So you did.

40:00.607 --> 40:03.735
<i>- I can tell. You had sex.</i>
- Full-size car, please.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.655
- Who is she? I wanna hear all about it.
- I gotta go.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.533
- Emergencies, I got my beeper on.
<i>- Fine, be that way.</i>

40:09.741 --> 40:12.119
- I don't need no insurance.
<i>- The bitch called.</i>

40:12.327 --> 40:14.538
<i>Said she and her mom
went to Niagara Falls.</i>

40:14.746 --> 40:18.125
Yeah. Probably working on her alibi.
I gotta go.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.336
Why don't you drive back to the hotel
with me?

40:21.545 --> 40:24.464
Unless you'd rather go
home in broad daylight

40:24.673 --> 40:26.883
with Jimmy right next door.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.344
Yeah, I'll go with you.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.671
Frankie Figs.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.342
Jimmy T.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.732
What's going on? What's up, baby?

41:24.065 --> 41:26.443
- How are you?
- What's up? Welcome to Montreal.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.529
- What's up? Good to see you.
- You're looking good.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.532
Oz, you look worried.

41:32.741 --> 41:34.534
- Doesn't he look worried?
- He does.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.161
Why don't you relax?

41:36.369 --> 41:40.207
Come on, Frankie told me
what a standup guy you've been.

41:41.875 --> 41:44.294
Now change your pants.
We're going out.

42:10.237 --> 42:15.200
I'm gonna keep the Coke and the fries,
but I'm gonna send this burger back.

42:15.408 --> 42:18.245
And if you put any mayonnaise on it,

42:19.287 --> 42:21.998
I'm gonna chop your legs off,
set your house on fire,

42:22.082 --> 42:26.878
and watch as you drag your bloody stumps
out of your house. Okay, Pierre?

42:27.754 --> 42:29.089
I'm fine.

42:29.631 --> 42:30.757
You're fine?

42:32.509 --> 42:35.136
Let me tell you something, Oz.
You are not fine.

42:35.345 --> 42:37.097
You know your wife wants you dead.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.225
That much I've figured out.

42:40.433 --> 42:43.728
And you should know
because I'm not the first one she came to.

42:43.937 --> 42:45.230
- The first?
- Hitter.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.315
- There were others?
- At least one.

42:47.524 --> 42:50.068
Apparently, that fell through,
so she came to me.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.736
Um...

42:52.153 --> 42:53.530
What did you tell her?

42:59.327 --> 43:01.454
You mean, did I take the contract?

43:10.130 --> 43:12.841
No. I didn't take the contract.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.010
- How much did she offer you?
- Ten grand.

43:18.597 --> 43:21.266
No wonder you turned her down.
Ha-ha-ha.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.101
But you did turn her down.

43:23.310 --> 43:24.978
Even though I went to Janni?

43:25.145 --> 43:26.521
You didn't go to Janni.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.690
Jimmy sent me to come to you.

43:29.983 --> 43:32.736
And I know that Frankie
can be very persuasive.

43:32.944 --> 43:35.739
- By the way, how's your urination?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.949
So why did you want me
to go see Janni?

43:38.158 --> 43:42.203
- So you could tell him where I was.
- So he'd come here and you could kill him?

43:42.412 --> 43:43.496
Exacto.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.416
By the way, I'd be happy to do your wife.

43:46.625 --> 43:47.751
- Do my wife?
- Tap her.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.253
- Tap her? Whack her. Oh.
- Whack her.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.756
Oh, see, I thought you meant, you know:

43:53.673 --> 43:57.177
Because she told me
that you, you know, hit on her.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.431
- That's funny.
- Whoo!

44:01.640 --> 44:03.224
Why is that funny?

44:04.726 --> 44:06.061
No, I...

44:06.770 --> 44:11.608
I actually wasn't gonna tell you this,
but the truth is, your wife came on to me.

44:12.942 --> 44:16.988
- And?
- Oz, we're friends.

44:17.197 --> 44:19.824
Friends do not engage
in sexual congress

44:20.033 --> 44:21.242
with each other's wives.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.078
Mm.

44:23.662 --> 44:28.249
Besides, I don't find your wife
particularly that attractive.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.251
- You just got out of prison.
- Yeah.

44:30.460 --> 44:33.838
Been in prison for five years
and don't find my wife attractive?

44:34.881 --> 44:36.716
She's not a good person.

44:39.344 --> 44:43.181
You've killed 17 people, and you
don't think my wife is a good person?

44:45.475 --> 44:49.437
It's not important
how many people I've killed.

44:50.355 --> 44:54.401
What's important is how I get along
with the people that are still alive.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.660
- You gonna finish this?
- Just take it.

45:25.765 --> 45:27.308
Whoo!

45:30.562 --> 45:32.480
I think we've given it long enough.

45:32.689 --> 45:35.525
Give Janni a call.
The sooner he gets here, the better.

45:35.734 --> 45:38.778
So after you kill Janni,
you're gonna go back to Chicago?

45:38.987 --> 45:40.530
No, I'm done with Chicago.

45:40.739 --> 45:44.492
What about your wife?
You're gonna get back together with her?

45:47.036 --> 45:48.747
You're gonna kill her too?

45:48.955 --> 45:51.416
For a hell of a lot more than $10,000.

45:51.624 --> 45:54.127
- Well, you can't do that.
- Why not?

45:54.210 --> 45:55.754
Because she's your wife.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.630
- Damn.
- You were right about him.

45:57.839 --> 45:59.674
This is one exceedingly sweet man.

45:59.883 --> 46:02.594
Wife like he got
and still believes in wedding vows.

46:02.802 --> 46:04.929
So do I. Especially till death do us part.

46:06.431 --> 46:09.184
Oh, God. It's my beeper.
I... I gotta go to the office.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.061
Well, wedding vows or not...

46:13.062 --> 46:14.522
I'd watch my back.

46:14.939 --> 46:17.317
I'd say your wife's still shopping
for a hitter.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.151
Good luck.

46:46.971 --> 46:50.016
On second thought, Mr. Tourette,
I think we're gonna have to pull the tooth.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.518
Hm?

47:05.073 --> 47:06.950
Oz, what is it? What's the matter?

47:07.367 --> 47:08.493
Eh...

47:11.621 --> 47:14.332
No, Oz. No, no. Oz, I'll take that. Oz.

47:17.210 --> 47:20.713
- I am your friend. Talk to me.
- Well, I have to talk to somebody

47:20.797 --> 47:23.299
- because I'm just... Gonna just...
- Take your time.

47:29.556 --> 47:30.723
That's good.

47:31.474 --> 47:35.395
Well, first of all, I just found out
that my wife is trying to have me killed.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.772
- Who told you?
- A friend.

47:37.981 --> 47:40.483
- Anyone I know?
- Oh, he's my next-door neighbor.

47:40.692 --> 47:43.403
And here's the funny part.
He's a hit man too. Ha-ha-ha!

47:43.611 --> 47:45.154
Really? What's his name?

47:45.363 --> 47:47.657
Jimmy. Jimmy Tudeski.

47:48.700 --> 47:49.826
Jimmy the Tulip?

47:50.994 --> 47:53.997
Jimmy the Tulip lives next to you
and you know him?

47:54.163 --> 47:56.082
Oz, can you introduce me to him?

47:56.749 --> 48:00.503
Jill. The man is a professional killer.

48:00.712 --> 48:03.548
You don't understand.
I've been wanting to meet this guy.

48:03.715 --> 48:05.300
Please, Oz. Come on.

48:07.719 --> 48:09.345
Oh! Oz.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.014
Quick, come on.

48:16.311 --> 48:18.187
- What's this, Oz?
- I don't know.

48:18.396 --> 48:19.856
It is you.

48:20.148 --> 48:21.941
Mr. Tudeski, you don't understand.

48:22.150 --> 48:26.321
I'm one of your biggest fans. I've been
following your career since I was a kid.

48:26.529 --> 48:29.240
You're the reason
I'm trying to get into the business.

48:30.658 --> 48:34.537
- What business would that be?
- Contract killing. It's what I wanna do.

48:34.704 --> 48:39.167
And if I could just have one afternoon,
I know I could learn so much from you.

48:42.170 --> 48:43.421
So come in.

48:47.467 --> 48:48.467
You too.

48:58.019 --> 49:00.063
- What's all this?
- You know this girl?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.440
- She's my assistant.
- You know she was a hitter?

49:02.649 --> 49:05.818
Actually, I'm still a virgin.
I haven't killed anyone yet.

49:06.027 --> 49:07.111
Professionally.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.447
- Oz was supposed to be first.
- Excuse me?

49:09.656 --> 49:11.407
- His wife hired me.
- That was you?

49:11.616 --> 49:15.495
I was supposed to make it an accident,
work for him so I familiarize myself

49:15.703 --> 49:17.664
- with his habits, know him.
- Smart.

49:17.872 --> 49:21.751
Thanks. But then after I got to know him,
I started to like him.

49:22.669 --> 49:24.379
- First mistake.
- I know.

49:24.587 --> 49:27.340
You should get close,
but not too close.

49:28.299 --> 49:31.427
- Go pour yourself a martini.
- It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.688
Don't give yourself too hard a time.
Got your career ahead of you.

49:42.438 --> 49:46.067
I remember when I was starting out.
I hadn't really done that much.

49:46.275 --> 49:50.655
Done a couple things, saw some money,
having fun. I was doing something I liked.

49:50.863 --> 49:53.908
Then I was recruited by Lazlo Gogolak,

49:54.117 --> 49:57.829
and first thing he wanted me to do
was whack out one of his cousins.

49:58.037 --> 50:00.665
- Is this the Stanley Posilansky incident?
- Yeah.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.795
Anyway, Lazlo doesn't want it
to look like a hit, right?

50:06.004 --> 50:10.299
So, now, I've gotta get close to Stanley,
who was this really charming, cute,

50:10.508 --> 50:13.761
funny little guy, very weird sense of humor,
made me laugh.

50:16.347 --> 50:18.975
I really liked him as a person.
You know what I mean?

50:19.308 --> 50:20.393
You got too close.

50:28.192 --> 50:29.360
Yeah, I got too close.

50:30.945 --> 50:33.489
- Hm.
- Moment of truth comes...

50:34.615 --> 50:35.908
- Choked.
- Him?

50:36.117 --> 50:38.036
Me. I choked.

50:38.244 --> 50:40.538
Couldn't do it. I actually...

50:40.663 --> 50:43.624
Ha-ha-ha. I... I told him
I was there to kill him.

50:43.833 --> 50:47.420
Can you believe that? I said,
"Run, Stanley, run. Go, go. Run. Hide.

50:47.628 --> 50:48.796
Off you go."

50:49.005 --> 50:53.843
We shake hands, part as friends,
turn around and walk away.

50:54.052 --> 50:56.846
This little weasel shoots me
in the back

50:57.055 --> 51:00.058
and the bullet comes out right here.

51:01.392 --> 51:04.896
- So, what did you do?
- I... I didn't really like Stanley after that.

51:06.939 --> 51:10.318
He took a really, really long time to die.

51:12.403 --> 51:14.322
And this scar is a reminder.

51:14.739 --> 51:16.032
Never get too close.

51:18.659 --> 51:19.659
Can...?

51:29.087 --> 51:30.421
Excuse me.

51:33.466 --> 51:34.801
Excuse me.

51:35.968 --> 51:39.305
Not to interrupt or anything,
but you were gonna kill me?

51:39.472 --> 51:40.723
That was the plan?

51:44.018 --> 51:46.395
- What are you doing tonight?
- No plans.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.108
Wanna help us out?
Me and Frankie Figs?

51:52.068 --> 51:54.028
Wait. Are you offering me a job?

51:55.488 --> 51:57.615
Only if you're interested.

51:58.199 --> 52:03.621
It would be an honor. It would be, like,
a dream come true. Who's the mark?

52:05.331 --> 52:06.415
Janni Gogo.

52:07.375 --> 52:08.793
Janni Gogo?

52:10.294 --> 52:12.380
Wow. Wow!

52:13.339 --> 52:14.882
Feel my arm. Goose bumps.

52:15.926 --> 52:16.926
Phone!

52:18.136 --> 52:19.262
Your phone scared me.

52:20.555 --> 52:21.931
There it is again.

52:23.432 --> 52:25.518
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

52:25.685 --> 52:27.395
Yeah? Frankie.

52:28.771 --> 52:31.899
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

52:32.984 --> 52:34.694
Okay, good. See you soon.

52:35.528 --> 52:37.530
- Good news?
- Great news.

52:38.114 --> 52:42.326
Apparently, Janni Gogo is on his way up
here and he's bringing my wife with him.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.954
- Your wife?
- Your wi...? He's go...?

52:45.163 --> 52:47.874
- Why?
- Janni figures he'll take care of her

52:48.040 --> 52:51.878
- when he takes care of me.
- So, what are you gonna do? Save her?

52:52.378 --> 52:53.963
No. I want her dead too.

52:54.297 --> 52:56.883
- Really?
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

52:57.091 --> 53:00.553
- Why would I? It's not like I know her.
- I can't believe you people.

53:00.761 --> 53:05.141
You are calmly talking about the murder
of a beautiful innocent woman

53:05.349 --> 53:08.019
whose only crime
is that she married you, Jimmy.

53:08.227 --> 53:10.855
So you know what?
Not gonna listen to this anymore.

53:11.230 --> 53:12.857
You know what I'm gonna do?

53:13.024 --> 53:14.108
I'm gonna...

53:14.942 --> 53:16.027
I'm gonna...

53:16.903 --> 53:18.321
I'm gonna go.

53:20.907 --> 53:22.241
I'm gonna...

53:22.783 --> 53:24.535
Does this slide? Wha...?

53:59.946 --> 54:01.322
Answer that.

54:05.785 --> 54:07.745
That's my phone, thank you.

54:11.165 --> 54:12.165
Hello?

54:15.169 --> 54:16.921
- Well, who was it?
- They hung up.

54:17.129 --> 54:18.381
Expecting a call?

54:19.131 --> 54:21.592
Explain to me
how that's any of your business.

54:21.801 --> 54:23.010
Get her bag.

54:23.678 --> 54:25.471
Plane's waiting and I'm not.

55:03.968 --> 55:05.344
Oh, my God.

55:13.227 --> 55:14.895
You don't like the Walther?

55:15.104 --> 55:17.106
You go what you're comfortable with.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.191
- It's what James Bond uses.
- Really?

55:19.400 --> 55:22.028
- Yeah.
- Still, I like to buy American.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.003
Is there any way I can stop you
from doing this?

55:39.420 --> 55:42.423
Oz, will you relax?
I promise you no one is gonna know

55:42.631 --> 55:45.259
- you had anything to do.
- That's not the point.

55:45.468 --> 55:48.262
- What is the point?
- You're still gonna kill your wife.

55:48.971 --> 55:49.971
Well?

55:52.558 --> 55:53.768
Yeah.

55:54.852 --> 55:57.480
I've got a very good reason
to kill my wife.

55:59.106 --> 56:02.109
About 10 million very good reasons
to kill my wife.

56:02.318 --> 56:04.653
Okay, well, uh, what if I said no?

56:05.654 --> 56:08.574
You know, what if I said
I wasn't gonna let you do it?

56:12.536 --> 56:13.954
Oh!

56:14.038 --> 56:17.166
You know, you are
the most chivalrous guy I've ever met.

56:17.375 --> 56:20.169
- Do you see why I couldn't kill him?
- I love him.

56:20.711 --> 56:23.255
Oz, come on.

56:23.464 --> 56:26.759
Relax. Come on over here,
sit down in your favorite chair,

56:26.967 --> 56:29.095
have another martini.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.347
Listen to me.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.475
Tonight is gonna happen
whether you want it to or not.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.143
And you're gonna help.

56:36.352 --> 56:37.520
Me? Help?

56:37.728 --> 56:39.605
Yeah. You help. You're gonna help.

56:39.814 --> 56:42.316
You're gonna go with Frankie
to meet Janni,

56:42.525 --> 56:46.320
because if not, Janni will get suspicious,
get back on the plane

56:46.404 --> 56:48.989
- and fly to Chicago, we don't want that.
- Jimmy...

56:49.198 --> 56:50.198
Oz...

56:50.866 --> 56:53.202
this is the way it's gotta be, okay?

56:53.411 --> 56:54.453
And...

56:55.955 --> 56:59.208
I'm telling you this like a friend
because if you...

56:59.417 --> 57:02.586
If you screw this up, I would hate to...

57:05.381 --> 57:07.800
I would really hate to have to kill you.

57:08.968 --> 57:12.263
I would hate it.
I hate it more than mayonnaise.

57:12.471 --> 57:14.473
- You know how I hate mayonnaise.
- I do.

57:14.682 --> 57:17.393
And besides, trust me,
you want Janni Gogolak dead.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.354
No. You're wrong.
I don't want anybody dead.

57:20.688 --> 57:24.108
If we don't make Janni Gogolak dead,
he's gonna make you dead.

57:24.316 --> 57:26.569
Gogolaks do not like to leave witnesses.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.237
Oh, so, now, we...

57:28.446 --> 57:32.408
Damn it, Jimmy. Why the hell did you
have to go and move in next door to me?

57:33.033 --> 57:37.288
Oz, do you know what kind of soil
they have in this backyard?

57:37.496 --> 57:41.167
- Been here two days. I got a tomato plant...
- Oh, my God.

57:44.295 --> 57:46.881
Yes. Yes. Yes.

57:47.089 --> 57:50.509
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Ugh. Ugh.

57:51.510 --> 57:53.929
- Hey, why did you stop?
- You doing it tonight?

57:54.138 --> 57:56.432
Tonight, whenever, go. Kick it into gear.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.392
- For 10,000?
- Wait a minute.

57:59.059 --> 58:01.979
- You said we were doing this for 15.
- I changed my mind.

58:02.188 --> 58:05.065
But if you think I should go
and find somebody else...

58:05.274 --> 58:06.775
No, no, no.

58:07.902 --> 58:11.447
Listen, why don't we make it, uh... 12,500?

58:12.281 --> 58:15.534
I can live with 12,500.
As long as my husband doesn't.

58:15.743 --> 58:16.952
He won't.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.245
I promise.

58:19.538 --> 58:22.166
- Oh, you must be...
- Jill St. Claire.

58:22.374 --> 58:26.754
And can I just say, Mr. Figueroa,
that I think the job you did on Kevin Vincent,

58:27.087 --> 58:30.090
that and the Ronald Abramson hit,
they were both just...

58:30.299 --> 58:32.051
They were... They're works of art.

58:32.259 --> 58:35.971
- Well, I see you've done your homework.
- Well, I keep a scrapbook.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.223
Frankie.

58:37.556 --> 58:40.100
- What's up, man?
- Honey, why don't you go get Oz?

58:40.309 --> 58:43.145
We'll run through,
make sure we know what we're doing.

58:43.354 --> 58:44.354
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.485
- She's a cute kid.
- Got definite potential.

58:51.111 --> 58:52.321
Ow!

58:59.161 --> 59:00.829
Time to rock 'n' roll.

01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.976
You know, I got this same car.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.436
- Really?
- No.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.796
All right, nobody move.

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.010
Everybody quiet.

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:03.535
God, I'm gonna love this.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.872
So, uh... now what?

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.625
Now we wait until...

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.004
he's asleep.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.339
Okay.

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.829
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.331
Let's get started.

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.313
We got company.

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:21.947
Anybody we know?

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.032
Oz's wife and some guy.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.536
Probably your replacement. The new hitter.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.206
Well, there's nothing we can do
about it now.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.792
- Keep an eye on them.
- Okay.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.919
Love those pants on you.

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.922
So, what is he, a bad guy, your husband?

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:40.924
No.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.927
Actually, everyone seems to like him.

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:47.514
Which might be the thing
I hate most about him.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:51.518
- Let's go over this one more time...
- What the hell for?

01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:54.271
I just wanna make sure
we got everything right.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.523
Any particular way
you want him to die?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.192
What do I care?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.862
I'm out of the country,
shopping for my funeral dress. Heh, heh.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.617
Dentist, get the blinds.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:12.498
Today.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:35.187
Oh, God. Of all the times...

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.774
- You're married?
- Yes.

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:41.026
Does your wife have any, um...?

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:43.821
Feminine products.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:48.075
Uh, yes, she does. They're right through
there. I'll show you where they are.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:51.995
Don't be long.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.331
- "Don't blong"?
- Don't be long.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.540
Gotcha.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.796
You make a noise, he gets out of bed
to see what the problem is,

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.091
and you make him dead, okay?
You understand me?

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:05.926
The dead part?

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:10.722
Ransack the house so it looks like a burglary,
get your ass back in this car,

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:14.017
and we drive
like hell back to Niagara Falls.

01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:16.854
Where you're gonna pay me
my other $5000.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.647
My mother's there waiting with it.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.067
Wait. Your mother, she knows about this?

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:24.903
My mother wants this to happen
as much as I do.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:28.574
And I really, really want this to happen.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.721
- They're gonna kill you. What?
- They're gonna kill you. What?

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:38.041
When they're done with Jimmy, Janni will
come after you. I came so I can warn you.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.418
Oh, that is...

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.757
Janni's not gonna kill anyone.
Jimmy's waiting for them.

01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:47.885
Jimmy and Frankie are in, you know...

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.136
- Cahoots.
- Right.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:52.264
- Are you cahooting?
- I had to pretend I was cahooting.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.183
But, listen, I have a plan.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:01.398
It's time. You two stay here.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.119
Hey, you know these guys?

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:16.997
No.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:18.957
- Hey.
- Who is that?

01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:26.214
- Is that Janni Gogolak?
- From the Gogolak gang.

01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:30.052
It might be. The guy they called
Jimmy the Tulip lives next door.

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:34.973
Jimmy the Tulip? Damn!
This is a hit. Stay right here!

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.863
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.824
You smell great.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:57.496
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.500
<i>All right, you got a gun now.
You gonna use it or not?</i>

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:02.876
<i>Kill him, major.</i>

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:05.796
<i>Yeah, kill him, major. Ha, ha.</i>

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.881
<i>Show him
how you're not afraid to die.</i>

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.675
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:21.311
<i>Looks like you don't want it enough,
what you want.</i>

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:27.192
<i>He laughs when something's funny
for a change.</i>

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:30.570
<i>One Rocco more or less
isn't worth dying for.</i>

01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:44.209
Hi. Are you guys looking for someone?

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.920
- Oh.
- Heh.

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:56.805
- Hi, Janni.
- Ugh.

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:57.889
Watch your head.

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:17.743
This whole sneaking-into-the-house thing
to try to kill me?

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:23.665
You guys are really good.
You're really... Ha-ha-ha. Bye, Janni.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:51.443
What's going on?

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.613
Oz took off with your wife
and Sophie's hitter is outside.

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:56.615
All right, I'll take care of it.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.242
You should get dressed.

01:07:59.451 --> 01:08:02.329
You know what?
Better yet, stay just like that.

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.165
In 60 seconds,
stick your head out that window.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.794
Hey.

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:11.296
Nice work.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.299
- Thanks, Jimmy.
<i>- Will we see you again, Frank?</i>

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:17.051
<i>- I hope so.</i>
- Be right back.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:22.432
You know, I can't think of nothing finer
than a fine naked woman holding a gun.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.935
And you just all kinds of fine, ain't you?

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.187
Don't get any ideas.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.983
Seriously sweet ass.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.867
Can I help you?

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.218
Now you can get dressed.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.178
Okay.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.569
Here we go. Where do you want this?

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.821
- Just put it over there.
- All right.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.706
What was Oz doing
going off with my wife?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.459
- I can beep him. You can ask him.
- Beep him.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:34.129
Now, ain't this some shit?

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:41.303
Maybe he won't come after us, you know?
Maybe he'll just let us go.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.514
Okay, maybe I can talk to him,
reason with him.

01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:46.057
We're friends now, right?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.185
That's what Harry Lefkowitz thought.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.312
What happened to Harry Lefkowitz?

01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:54.691
I don't wanna know
what happened to Harry Lefkowitz.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:55.942
Ah!

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:58.278
It's your beeper.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.655
I know.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:03.491
It's Jimmy.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.162
Jimmy, it's me.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:13.043
Oz, what the hell were you thinking,
taking off with Cynthia like that?

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:16.838
I'm sorry, but I can't let you kill her.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:20.008
What do you mean?
That's got nothing to do with you.

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:22.177
I'm in love with her.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.056
Look, I don't...

01:10:29.226 --> 01:10:31.478
- What did you just say?
- I love her.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.985
Will... Will you listen to yourself?
You love her? You just met her.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.655
- He said he's in love with Cynthia.
- No shit.

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:43.573
- So she's the one.
- The one what?

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.451
- The one he schtupped in Chicago.
- The one he...?

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.247
My wife.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.668
You schtupped my wife, Oz?

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:59.256
I wouldn't exactly necessarily phrase it
that way, exactly.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:00.882
Let me get this straight.

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:04.594
You went to Chicago and engaged
in sexual congress with my wife?

01:11:04.803 --> 01:11:08.139
Is that what you're telling me?
Is that it? Is that what you...?

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:10.225
- Jimmy, calm down.
- I swear to God!

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:12.310
He's a little upset.

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:16.273
- I've managed to upset a mass murderer.
<i>- Tell me where you are!</i>

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.817
Find out where he is!
Just stay right there!

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.319
- Squeeze.
- Oz, you stud, you.

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:22.862
Gonna be a dead stud.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:27.200
Tell Jimmy I might have thought
of a way out of this.

01:11:27.409 --> 01:11:29.869
I know you guys got spare bodies
lying around.

01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:31.788
Yeah, one of them is a cop.

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:34.916
- What's he saying?
- Uh-huh.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.418
What's he saying?

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:39.838
Tell him to stay where he is,
I'll be right there.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.048
Okay, so that sounds great.

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:45.510
I'm gonna run it by the boys,
and I'll beep you right back. Bye.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:51.725
Jimmy, when's the last time
you went to the dentist?

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.439
You really meant it, didn't you?

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.940
What you said.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:04.154
About what? Loving you? Of course,
what did you think this was all about?

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:06.656
Sex.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.827
- I mean, great sex, but...
- It was pretty good.

01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:16.291
Is that all this has meant to you?

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.337
Don't get me wrong, Oz.
I like you a lot.

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:24.049
Well, that's great to hear,
but I've got news for you.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:27.552
I don't go around risking my life
for people that just like me.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.391
Well, I do like you.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:36.394
But...

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.400
Then again, who knows? Maybe...

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:46.112
Maybe this feeling I've been having
in the pit of my stomach...

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:48.698
maybe it's love.

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:49.823
Ah!

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.493
It's your beeper.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.079
I know.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:00.835
- Yeah?
- It's me.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:04.506
I'll tell you one thing, you got balls.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.549
Yeah, who knew?

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.551
Jill told me your idea.

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.762
And, uh...

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.559
I think it's worth a try.

01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:21.940
- Jimmy, thank you.
<i>- But just so you know...</i>

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.152
I am disappointed, Oz.

01:13:26.945 --> 01:13:30.615
I am extremely disappointed with you.

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:33.910
You're the last person
I would ever want to disappoint,

01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:37.622
but everything I did was for love.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.167
Yeah, whatever.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.796
See you at your office.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.381
Okay, give me an hour.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.550
Oh, and don't forget the corpse.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:00.770
Monsieur Boulez, remember to floss.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.735
Stay on the boat. Take this.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:12.824
If you don't hear from me in two hours, just go.
Disappear, leave the country.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.368
Oz.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.121
Be careful.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.335
I'm Mr. Careful.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:05.835
Oz, I just wanted
to make sure it was you.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.837
Everybody's inside.

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:11.758
By the way, <i>huevos grandes,</i> amigo.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.809
The great and powerful Oz.

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:26.814
Why don't we get started?

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.614
So far, so good.

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:03.578
Shit.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.121
- Is he up?
- Yeah, got him.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.416
Okay. Now let's see if he stays.

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:11.169
All right. Frankie, duct tape.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.684
We did it.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.396
Yeah, I think we're good.

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:35.485
- Barbecue?
- Barbecue.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:53.503
Turned out to be a nice night tonight.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:01.302
I'll be right back.

01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:08.851
- Who's this remind you of?
- Old Charlie.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.738
- All right.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:22.448
Okay.

01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:58.359
Doctor? These men need to see you.

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.113
Excuse me.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.615
Right this way, gentlemen.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:10.913
Dr. Oseransky,
I'm Sergeant Buchanan.

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:12.498
This is Officer Morrissey.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:16.252
Yes, well, what can I do for you?

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:22.467
Are you the owner
of a brown Toyota Corolla

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:26.012
license number ZSJ-959?

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.264
Yes, is there a problem?

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:30.600
Do you know where your vehicle is, sir?

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:35.730
- I lent it to my neighbor. He went fishing.
- This neighbor, he got a name?

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:38.148
Jimmy Jones.

01:19:41.486 --> 01:19:44.322
Would you mind taking us
to his place of residence?

01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:48.242
Your car was found by the grain silo
at the old port.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:51.037
Two bodies were inside of it.
There'd been a fire.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.290
- Oh, my God.
- The extent of the burns

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.834
made any normal identification impossible.

01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:58.795
Dental impressions were taken.

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:02.298
From the records, we were able
to establish that the bodies

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:07.470
were those of one Janni Pytor Gogolak
and James Stefan Tudeski.

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:10.973
Both of them were big shots
in a Chicago crime syndicate.

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:12.141
Mm-hm.

01:20:13.184 --> 01:20:16.062
- And you think this James...
- Tudeski.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.855
Is the Jimmy I know?

01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:20.775
Well, that's what we intend to find out.

01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:34.497
Isn't that Hanson's car?

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:38.876
- Go have a look.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:42.129
Who's, uh...? Who's Hanson?

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:43.798
One of our men.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.092
He was on an undercover assignment.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:50.429
There was some concern earlier because
he failed to check in this morning.

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.531
<i>Your mother, she knows about this?</i>

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:11.242
<i>My mother wants this to happen
as much as I do.</i>

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:14.328
<i>And I really, really want this to happen.</i>

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:23.921
It's Hanson's car all right,
but no sign of Hanson.

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.299
- But I found a tape.
- Tsk, tsk.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.731
Dr. Oseransky, could you tell us
where your wife might be?

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:45.026
My wife? She's in Niagara Falls
with her mother. Why?

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.739
Dr. Oseransky,
I don't know how to tell you this,

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:53.492
but it seems that your wife
tried to hire a hit man to kill you.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.995
A hit man?

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:58.414
Oh, my God.

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.715
There's no smoking in here.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:18.184
So where is he, Mrs. Oseransky?

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:21.437
- Questions for you, better have answers.
- Hi, Mom.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.276
You can ask me questions,
but until I speak to my attorney...

01:22:27.485 --> 01:22:31.280
You spoke to your attorney.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with you.

01:22:31.781 --> 01:22:35.409
Special Agent Hanson, Mrs. Oseransky.
What did you do to him?

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:36.953
Wasn't me.

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.914
We have your voice on tape,
his written reports.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.626
We know you tried to hire him
to kill your husband. So, what happened?

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.670
He tried to back out?

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.923
He tried to back out and you killed him.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.968
None of this would've happened
if that girl had done her job.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.554
- What girl?
- Jill. My husband's receptionist.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.266
Oh, yeah?
Was she a contract killer too?

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:00.977
Yes. I hired her.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.520
She's the killer.

01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:12.279
This would be sad
if it wasn't so pathetic.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.115
Do you wanna talk to her?

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:16.242
No.

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:17.994
No, I don't think so.

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:19.829
Hm. I don't blame you.

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.957
You guys know a good divorce lawyer?

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:26.377
She did it. She's a killer.
You've got to believe me.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:39.432
- I got all the I's dotted, all the T's crossed.
- Jimmy's got his own way of spelling.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.435
I'll take care of Jimmy.
You're never gonna see him again.

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:46.313
While you and Jill are at the bank,
Jimmy and I will be at the museum.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.984
- Jimmy at a fine-art museum?
- There's people at a fine-art museum.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.527
He's not gonna try anything.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.530
All right, if you say so.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:08.294
Where's Cynthia?

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:12.131
You and I are leaving.

01:24:17.011 --> 01:24:20.848
I'll beep Cynthia. She'll get in touch
with you and tell you where to go.

01:24:21.057 --> 01:24:23.350
Listen to him, Mr. Cloak and Dagger.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.604
- I'm being careful. I'm a dentist.
- Yeah.

01:24:32.193 --> 01:24:34.070
You boys play nice now.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:40.618
Take us to the art museum.

01:24:42.787 --> 01:24:46.874
You really think if Cynthia doesn't come through,
you'll be safer at the museum?

01:25:01.222 --> 01:25:02.306
Hello?

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:10.481
Hope there was nothing special you wanted
to see at the museum today.

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.942
- Why?
- We're not going to the art museum.

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.527
We're going to the marina.

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.196
- The marina?
- Yeah.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:21.117
I rented a boat for the day.
Isn't that right, Frankie?

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:28.707
See?

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.626
I'm careful too.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:14.252
You're Jill?

01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:17.715
Nice to meet you.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:22.553
- Where's your gun?
- What makes you think I have a gun?

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:36.567
Throw it in.

01:26:44.033 --> 01:26:45.534
Do you have the certificates?

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:48.704
Let's go banking.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.795
Everything seems to be in order.

01:26:57.004 --> 01:27:01.300
- Where would you like the money sent?
- To a bank in the Caymans. Account...

01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:04.553
- Can we just have a minute, please?
- Certainly.

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:07.056
- Thanks.
- I'll be right over there.

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:17.149
We could just walk away, you know.

01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:20.569
You and me. With the whole 10 million.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.118
So, what do you think?

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:36.335
I think...

01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:39.838
I know that if we did,
Jimmy would kill Oz.

01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:41.465
So what?

01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:50.057
You're a lucky guy, Oz.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:52.059
Why would you say that?

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.230
You're about to find out
if the woman you love really loves you.

01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:58.232
Want a beer?

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:05.239
If it was me, if I was in her position,
I'd just take the money and run.

01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:09.785
What are you betting on?

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:12.538
I'm betting on love.

01:28:13.956 --> 01:28:16.166
Love for you means money for me.

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:20.462
And like I said before,
I'd really hate to have to kill you.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.397
- So, when are you gonna do it?
- Let's make sure we got the money first.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.652
But you are intending to kill him?

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.158
Jimmy, listen, he was there.

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:52.119
He was there
when you killed Janni and a cop.

01:28:52.328 --> 01:28:54.330
Now, I know you like this guy.

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.833
Yeah, I do.

01:28:58.042 --> 01:28:59.084
But he's got to go.

01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:02.629
- And if you ain't prepared to do it, then...
- Hey, hey, Frankie.

01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:06.508
Let's not forget who
you're talking to, okay?

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.637
Jimmy Tudeski may be dead,

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:13.599
but he ain't exactly dead. You understand?

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:16.602
Glad to hear it.

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.438
Just drive the boat.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:28.489
Think about it, Cynthia.
We're talking about $5 million apiece here.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.491
Is Oz worth that much to you?

01:29:33.619 --> 01:29:35.788
The thing is, is, um...

01:29:37.623 --> 01:29:39.500
- I think I love him.
- You think?

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:43.587
You think? Sweetheart, for $5 million,
you better be damn certain.

01:29:47.216 --> 01:29:48.550
I am.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:53.055
I'm sorry, but I... I love him.

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.183
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.436
That's the right answer.
Yo! Guy, you can come back now.

01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:07.527
Yeah?

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:10.114
Yeah.

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:13.283
Okay.

01:30:15.828 --> 01:30:17.121
Okay.

01:30:19.832 --> 01:30:20.874
We got the money.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880
Bye-bye, Oz.

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:31.802
But...

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:42.020
Sorry, Frankie.

01:30:43.439 --> 01:30:44.523
I always liked you.

01:30:46.984 --> 01:30:48.777
Wh... Why... Why did you kill him?

01:30:49.486 --> 01:30:51.238
Well, I had to kill one of you.

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:56.702
Well, then you definitely made
the right decision.

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:02.791
But why did you have to kill him?

01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:10.591
Well, if I didn't kill you,
Frankie would have.

01:31:11.592 --> 01:31:12.801
And...

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:16.430
he would have thought that I'd gone soft,

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:19.766
eventually come after me and the money.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:25.147
So...

01:31:27.024 --> 01:31:28.025
what about me?

01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:32.779
I want the bulk of the money
to be put into this account.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:35.824
I also want $1 million
to be placed in this account

01:31:36.033 --> 01:31:39.578
under the name of Dr. Nicholas
and Mrs. Cynthia Oseransky.

01:31:39.786 --> 01:31:42.080
- One million.
- What?

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.333
An early wedding present from Jimmy.

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:48.504
Not that Jimmy.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:51.840
Can we have another minute?

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.760
- Certainly. I'll just...
- Thanks.

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.893
- Is this for real?
- Yes, in order to get the money,

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:07.356
show up together and show them
a copy of a validated marriage certificate.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:09.733
Jimmy's giving me a divorce?

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:13.695
Don't you read the papers, lady?
Jimmy Tudeski's dead.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:19.076
Oh...

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:24.122
- I don't know what to say.
- When the time comes, just say "I do."

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:27.417
Yo.

01:32:27.626 --> 01:32:31.672
Maybe I am going soft.
In the old days, I would have definitely killed you.

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:34.132
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself.

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.844
Or...

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:39.429
I don't know.

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:42.182
Maybe I have changed since my death.

01:32:44.393 --> 01:32:46.228
I don't think that's what it is.

01:32:46.436 --> 01:32:47.896
What do you mean?

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.984
You love her, don't you?

01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:53.443
Cynthia?

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:13.547
Hi, Oz. Cynthia's waiting for you.
She said you'd know where.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:20.304
Say hi to my widow for me, will you?

01:33:22.723 --> 01:33:24.224
Take care of yourself.

01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:46.246
Marry me.

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:53.629
Jimmy told you.

01:33:55.172 --> 01:33:56.172
What?

01:33:59.468 --> 01:34:00.719
He didn't, did he?

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.934
You just want to marry me?

01:34:08.352 --> 01:34:09.394
No.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:12.981
No, I don't just want to marry you.

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:19.780
I want to marry you more
than anyone's wanted to marry anyone.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.536
Then would I be out of line
if I told you...

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:29.456
that I loved you?

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.178
And said, yes?

01:34:46.515 --> 01:34:48.058
I would love to marry you.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:52.771
So you wouldn't mind spending
the rest of your life with a poor dentist?

01:34:54.481 --> 01:34:56.817
