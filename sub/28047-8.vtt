WEBVTT

00:07.200 --> 00:08.220
I'm done, man.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.210
Good people are dead,
because all we do

00:10.230 --> 00:12.210
is stick our hands out for
payoffs

00:13.010 --> 00:14.010
from hood rats!

00:14.030 --> 00:16.050
Dani's got a good home.
A loving home.

00:16.070 --> 00:18.050
But she's still more fit
to care for Dani

00:18.070 --> 00:19.220
than strangers the court's
gonna stick her with.

00:21.180 --> 00:23.060
Why are the Colombians here?
We're getting into the dope

00:23.100 --> 00:23.170
business?

00:23.190 --> 00:25.170
If the money's right, why not?

00:30.180 --> 00:33.110
We need to get Ignacio
back in custody.

00:33.130 --> 00:36.030
Find out where he's at,
and tell me.

00:36.050 --> 00:38.100
Get on the ground now!

00:39.020 --> 00:40.120
If they don't all go to jail,

00:40.140 --> 00:41.180
we'll be lookin' over our
shoulders

00:41.220 --> 00:42.230
for the rest of our lives.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.160
Victor knows enough to
take 'em all down.

00:44.180 --> 00:47.110
You don't have to talk,
but I suggest you listen.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.120
Victor's gonna testify
against the cartel.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.190
-Where are Lourdes and Veronica?
-They're in WITSEC.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.110
Witness protection?!

00:53.130 --> 00:55.100
Why'd you give 'em up
without talking to me?!

00:55.120 --> 00:57.030
When can you bring Victor to me?

00:57.050 --> 00:59.230
If I can bring him to you,
I want assurances.

01:00.010 --> 01:02.000
No other retaliation
on my family.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.020
You have our word.

01:04.060 --> 01:06.180
You made a stupid choice
that put my family in danger.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.030
I'm doin' this for my daughter.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.060
So was I.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.170
I couldn't do it.

01:10.190 --> 01:12.090
I wanted to, but I couldn't do
it.

01:12.130 --> 01:13.070
How bad is it?

01:13.090 --> 01:14.180
Karen, there's something
you should know.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.060
The cartel's gunning for us.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.130
-I already talked to Ramos.
-I'm sorry.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.070
Shit.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.120
Steve...

03:45.180 --> 03:47.150
Anyone notify her mother?

03:49.090 --> 03:51.130
- I'll do it.
- Listen.

03:51.150 --> 03:54.120
Can't just sit around
feelin' sorry for ourselves.

03:54.140 --> 03:57.170
This was the cartel's
opening shot.

03:57.190 --> 04:00.090
They're gonna be
comin' after all of us.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.020
We've always told each
other the truth.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.060
But what I have to say
is gonna hurt.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.140
Not now.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.080
You don't have to listen,

04:12.100 --> 04:14.010
but I'm gonna say it.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.040
This ain't about the cartel,
is it?

04:18.100 --> 04:19.230
It's about us.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.070
And we brought this shit
on ourselves--

04:22.090 --> 04:23.100
Seriously? Hm?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.060
You want to get on your soapbox
right now?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.160
Like I said, you don't have to
hear it,

04:27.200 --> 04:29.100
but it needs to be said.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.070
Not now it doesn't.

04:31.090 --> 04:33.020
Man, shit ain't gonna change
around here

04:33.060 --> 04:33.210
until we do.

04:35.110 --> 04:37.160
Get your head in the game...

04:37.180 --> 04:38.230
or you're next.

04:51.220 --> 04:53.190
I'm gonna go get my sister
somewhere safe.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.100
- You OK?
- Go.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.020
Do what you have to do.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.080
Listen up!

05:23.190 --> 05:27.020
We just lost...

05:27.040 --> 05:28.220
lost another one of ours.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.220
The cartel's at war with the
Ravens,

05:33.020 --> 05:35.060
and there's nothin' we can do
about it.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.020
So keep your shit tight.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.130
Doesn't feel right.

05:42.090 --> 05:44.220
Just waitin' around
for them to make a move.

05:47.090 --> 05:49.040
Have we got a location on 'em?

05:50.070 --> 05:51.070
No.

05:55.150 --> 05:57.150
I know you two were close.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.000
I'm sorry. I really am.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.100
-Are ya?
-I am.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.180
She was a good kid.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.130
But right now,

06:11.150 --> 06:12.230
you're not thinkin' straight.

06:15.060 --> 06:18.080
You need to step back
and let me take it from here.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.040
You wanna run this again?

06:20.060 --> 06:22.130
Leadership is about
the good of the group.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.110
This is what they want.

06:31.210 --> 06:34.000
Everything I do is
for this club.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.120
No, it isn't.

06:35.140 --> 06:39.020
The bank job, that was about
a lawyer for Tom.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.060
And the cartel relationship
was about the gun

06:41.080 --> 06:42.210
they were leveraging you with.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.100
I'm not gonna step aside.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.040
'Cause I can still get us
out of this mess.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.180
And what if you don't?

07:05.180 --> 07:07.170
-To Beach!
-Beach.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.230
Police are still looking for
what is believed to be a lone

07:20.030 --> 07:20.100
gunman

07:20.120 --> 07:23.000
in the fatal shooting
of an off-duty police officer

07:23.020 --> 07:24.140
in the 4000 block of Redwood
Avenue

07:24.180 --> 07:25.080
last night.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.150
The officer, identified
as Karen Beach,

07:27.170 --> 07:29.040
was talking on her phone while
leaving

07:29.080 --> 07:30.170
a restaurant around 10:00 p.m.,

07:30.190 --> 07:33.080
when she was ambushed
and shot multiple times.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.200
This is the second shooting
of a police officer

07:35.220 --> 07:37.070
in the last six months...

07:37.090 --> 07:38.170
and comes on the heels of a news
report

07:38.210 --> 07:40.030
claiming the police department

07:40.050 --> 07:42.050
-is infested with corrupt cop
gangs.

07:43.050 --> 07:45.050
The department is saying
there are currently no leads

07:45.070 --> 07:47.040
and is asking the public
for any information

07:47.060 --> 07:48.150
from anyone in the
area at that--

08:10.190 --> 08:12.150
It happened quick.

08:13.140 --> 08:15.140
She didn't suffer.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.150
She didn't, huh?

08:21.030 --> 08:22.130
Were you there?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.190
No.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.000
Were there any witnesses?

08:35.040 --> 08:36.110
No.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.120
Then how the fuck can
you know that?

08:44.160 --> 08:46.150
Listen, I know that
you're upset.

08:47.220 --> 08:51.050
There's nothing that I can say
to make this feeling go away,

08:51.090 --> 08:51.180
but...

08:55.000 --> 08:56.150
just know that we're
here for you.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.150
We're gonna take care
of the funeral arrangements.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.130
I'll let you know
when and where.

09:04.150 --> 09:06.170
No. No.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.040
It's my daughter.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.210
She's my daughter,
I wanna be involved.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.180
Karen would have
wanted it that way.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.080
Look, I'm sorry, ma'am, I--
I'm sorry.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.040
I'm sorry.

09:35.030 --> 09:37.130
Look, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

09:37.150 --> 09:39.110
Look, I'm sorry. OK?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Hey.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.070
It's only for a week or two, OK?
I promise.

10:03.110 --> 10:05.010
This is all my fault.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.090
I'm sorry.

10:08.110 --> 10:10.100
-No, it's not.
-It is.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.210
Look, this has nothin'
to do with you.

10:12.230 --> 10:14.210
Listen to me.

10:14.230 --> 10:18.170
What you did wasn't wrong, OK?

10:18.190 --> 10:21.050
What happened, happened
because I did something bad.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.090
None of this is your fault.
You understand?

10:25.110 --> 10:27.180
There's nothing you need
to apologize for.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.100
-Not to me, not to nobody.
-I'm scared.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.090
I don't even know this lady,

10:33.110 --> 10:35.030
and I don't want to
lose you again.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.040
You're not gonna lose me.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.140
Come here.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.160
I'm sorry.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.060
I'm sorry.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.040
Go on.

11:27.050 --> 11:28.120
Hey.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.160
Hey.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.140
-Just came to pay my respects.
-She's pretty torn up, man.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.070
She just wanna have a say
in the ceremony.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.180
-Burn or bury?
-Doesn't care either way.

11:41.230 --> 11:44.230
She just wants us all
to be in uniform.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.190
Show some respect for what
her daughter stood for, ya know?

11:48.210 --> 11:50.110
You think Beach would
have wanted that?

11:53.100 --> 11:55.010
I think Beach tried
real hard to show

11:55.030 --> 11:57.120
that she didn't give a damn
about anything, man.

11:58.170 --> 12:00.040
But, yeah...

12:00.060 --> 12:02.000
I think she'd want it formal.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.090
Look, I'm sorry about
your family.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.180
Yeah, but your brother ain't.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.220
He  is.  And you know it.

12:14.010 --> 12:15.080
At least they're safe, right?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.070
Says who?

12:17.090 --> 12:19.180
You think WITSEC
can't be cracked?

12:21.030 --> 12:22.070
If  anything  happens to my
daughter,

12:22.110 --> 12:23.000
it's on Steve.

12:23.020 --> 12:25.090
No! It's on all of us, Pete!

12:26.110 --> 12:29.040
We fucked up
the second we chose this life,

12:29.080 --> 12:29.230
brother.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.120
And you know that shit.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.110
How'd it go with Beach's mother?

13:44.130 --> 13:47.020
As good as something
like that  can  go.

13:49.010 --> 13:51.190
Close the door.
I wanna talk.

13:51.210 --> 13:53.150
Why?

13:53.170 --> 13:56.070
I'm pretty sure I made it clear
where I stand on all this,

13:56.110 --> 13:56.190
Steve.

13:59.230 --> 14:02.110
I know you're hurtin' right now,
brother,

14:02.130 --> 14:04.050
I know it.

14:04.070 --> 14:06.030
But you need to put all of that
aside

14:06.070 --> 14:07.050
and focus on us.

14:09.160 --> 14:12.040
Because right now it's
about survival.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.140
So fuck everything else.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.230
Our mother...

14:21.010 --> 14:22.220
Amber...

14:23.000 --> 14:25.110
Pastor Greg, and now Beach.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.020
This is our sins
comin' back on us.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.100
We need to atone, brother.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.200
And the only way we can do that
is if we walk a different path.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.140
That's what I've been tryin'
to do.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.210
It's always one more
job with you.

14:42.230 --> 14:46.080
One more push...
before we end it.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.070
Do you even see that?

14:50.100 --> 14:53.190
You have no idea where
all this ends, do you, brother?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.040
It ends badly.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.060
Is that what you want to hear?

15:22.200 --> 15:25.020
-What's up with you?
-Nothin'.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.190
Why'd you turn your
head like that?

15:27.210 --> 15:29.190
I didn't.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.210
You feel like you
made a mistake?

15:33.230 --> 15:35.060
N-No.

15:36.020 --> 15:39.010
We fucked. It happens.
Get over it.

15:39.030 --> 15:41.090
-Yeah, twice.
-So what?

15:41.110 --> 15:43.110
What, you don't love me?

15:43.130 --> 15:45.150
Don't wanna spend
the rest of your life with me?

15:47.130 --> 15:49.150
-Look, I know how women can be.
-Obviously not.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.090
I had an itch, and you
scratched it.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.110
You weren't the first
and you won't be the last.

15:56.130 --> 15:57.170
So get over yourself.

16:09.060 --> 16:10.200
Yeah, yeah.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.010
Steve.

16:15.030 --> 16:18.200
-Another time.
-Hey, I just talked to Tom.

16:22.110 --> 16:24.090
Yeah, whatever he has to say,
keep it to yourself.

16:24.110 --> 16:28.050
No. He can get you papers.
Some cash.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.200
I'm not runnin', Carl.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.160
That's somethin' he would do.

16:32.180 --> 16:34.160
I got us in, I'll get us out.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.160
You got anything sharp
in your pockets, you tell us

16:46.200 --> 16:47.010
now.

16:47.030 --> 16:48.200
Because she gets stuck
with a needle,

16:48.220 --> 16:51.030
I'm gonna crack your head
wide open, you feel me?

16:51.050 --> 16:52.190
What is this?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.070
Nothing.

16:55.090 --> 16:56.160
Ain't nothin'.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.060
I put my hand in there,
it comes back with

16:58.080 --> 17:00.130
some shit on the other end,
I'm gonna be pissed.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.220
It's toilet paper.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.070
Used or fresh?

17:03.090 --> 17:04.160
Both.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.100
Start walkin'.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.140
And if I get one more call
for you,

17:09.180 --> 17:10.110
you're goin' to jail.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.180
You understand me?

17:13.030 --> 17:14.060
Get on.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.170
You get your sister
somewhere safe?

17:17.190 --> 17:19.150
She's with a family friend.

17:19.170 --> 17:22.020
All that matters now
is gettin' those assholes that

17:22.060 --> 17:22.200
did Beach.

17:22.220 --> 17:24.150
Really?

17:24.170 --> 17:27.010
Revenge,
that's all that matters?

17:27.030 --> 17:28.180
She was one of us.

17:31.230 --> 17:34.050
You don't even know yet
what bein' one of us actually

17:34.090 --> 17:34.140
is.

17:35.230 --> 17:38.000
Just because you're havin'
a fuckin' identity crisis

17:38.020 --> 17:39.060
don't mean you gotta
put it on me.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.200
I know exactly what this
life is about.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.040
And I'm good with it.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.030
Wanna hear my side of this?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.160
Nope.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.080
Yo, we got company.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.070
-What, Feds?
-Yeah.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.150
They got a case.
Why are they following us?

18:26.170 --> 18:27.170
Shit!

18:29.210 --> 18:32.030
-Down! Down! Down!
-Shit!

18:40.210 --> 18:43.040
Aaah!

18:48.090 --> 18:49.170
Go! Go!

18:53.010 --> 18:55.080
-Cover me!
-Go, go, go, go!

19:05.180 --> 19:06.190
Reload!

19:33.050 --> 19:34.050
Cover!

19:35.150 --> 19:37.150
-Shit!
-Go! Go!

19:46.100 --> 19:49.070
-I got a shot!
-No! Don't kill him!

19:49.090 --> 19:50.190
Ah, shit!

20:03.110 --> 20:06.020
Let's get the cleanup crew
to collect these shells.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.000
And get the pedestrians back,
please.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.120
- You lost him.
- Where's his partner?

20:14.140 --> 20:16.110
He ditched the Jeep
and bailed on foot before we

20:16.150 --> 20:17.030
caught up.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.020
- Shit!
- We were fuckin' bait, huh?

20:20.040 --> 20:21.150
Is that it?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.210
You touch me one more time,

20:24.230 --> 20:26.060
I'm gonna put you in a hole so
deep

20:26.110 --> 20:27.090
you'll never get out.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.080
Oh, so if we got killed,
fuck it, huh?!

20:29.100 --> 20:32.160
You both put yourselves
in this position. Not us!

20:32.180 --> 20:36.230
Arrest us,
or stay the fuck out of our way!

20:58.120 --> 21:00.090
Better hope he's still here.

21:00.110 --> 21:02.030
Just keep an eye out.

21:15.210 --> 21:16.210
No.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.030
Bueno.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.230
Sí.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.100
No.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.100
Turn him over.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.140
- What's wrong?
- I want to make a deal.

23:09.030 --> 23:12.040
-Hammond?
- I have your friend.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.180
So if you're as smart as I think
you are,

23:14.220 --> 23:16.060
you know what happens next.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.190
-Don't hurt him.
- If you want to see him again,

23:21.210 --> 23:23.110
meet me in 20 minutes.

23:34.170 --> 23:35.200
Come on.

24:18.210 --> 24:19.230
Huh?

25:03.020 --> 25:04.160
You might as well
send us both to jail,

25:04.180 --> 25:05.160
because if I give you the
address,

25:05.200 --> 25:06.180
we're both as good as dead.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.130
Jail's not on the table.
You tell us or we kill you right

25:08.170 --> 25:08.220
here!

25:09.000 --> 25:10.020
You're not gonna do jackshit--

25:15.050 --> 25:16.090
Motherfucker!

25:22.040 --> 25:23.200
Next one goes in his head!

25:29.180 --> 25:31.070
Where are they?!

25:49.140 --> 25:51.050
Better hope this isn't a
dry run again.

25:51.070 --> 25:53.120
Trust me, I want this
prick

25:53.160 --> 25:55.020
as badly as you do.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.030
Making entry now.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.030
Target area is secure.
Fanning out.

26:21.030 --> 26:22.200
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

26:22.220 --> 26:24.110
Agreed.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.170
But where the hell's his sister?

26:33.210 --> 26:35.020
Son of a bitch.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.210
Can we get a medic over here?!

26:41.190 --> 26:44.170
Whether he lives or dies...
he's done.

26:45.110 --> 26:48.150
-So what now?
-We find and arrest Carmen.

26:49.220 --> 26:51.060
Between Victor's testimony and
yours,

26:51.100 --> 26:52.220
we should have a strong enough
case.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.050
And what if she makes it
back to Colombia?

26:56.070 --> 26:57.200
It's gonna take years to
extradite her.

26:57.220 --> 26:59.140
Doesn't change things for you.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.040
You got a short time
to get your house in order.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.130
And remember, if you run,

27:06.150 --> 27:08.130
the rest of your people
are goin' down as well.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.120
Carmen.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.070
Shit.

29:41.050 --> 29:42.110
Hmm?

29:48.150 --> 29:49.160
Huh?

29:53.230 --> 29:55.190
- Mami! No!
- Sofia, no!

29:55.210 --> 29:57.100
No! Sofia!

30:15.080 --> 30:18.030
Sofia! Sofia!

30:52.150 --> 30:53.170
Carmen.

32:11.150 --> 32:12.190
Shit.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.030
Did you say goodbye
to the others?

32:44.100 --> 32:46.210
-No.
-Hold up. Hold up.

32:50.090 --> 32:52.190
I know you told me
to keep my nose out of this...

32:55.100 --> 32:58.070
but I can have Christine waiting
in a car out back in less than

32:58.110 --> 32:58.180
five.

33:00.230 --> 33:03.230
Do the smart thing, brother.
Take off.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.070
Please.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.180
If I run, it brings grief
on the rest of you.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.030
I've already done too
much of that.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.040
Take care of yourself.

34:21.070 --> 34:23.000
Why are you here?

34:23.020 --> 34:25.060
Came to say goodbye.

34:28.070 --> 34:30.020
Your brother know yet?

34:31.090 --> 34:33.020
Not yet.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.000
How ya holdin' up?

34:36.020 --> 34:37.020
I'm OK.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.210
It is what it is, right?

34:41.050 --> 34:43.040
Karen's funeral's next week.

34:46.010 --> 34:48.060
Make sure we're represented.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.190
Will do.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.130
What I'm doin' here
gives everyone a clean slate.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.230
Use it to get out of this life.

35:03.220 --> 35:05.010
We got a problem.

35:05.030 --> 35:06.150
What kind of problem?

35:06.170 --> 35:08.120
Victor turned out to be more
cooperative

35:08.160 --> 35:10.010
than any of us anticipated.

35:10.030 --> 35:13.010
Part of his information dump
concerns the Ravens,

35:13.030 --> 35:15.090
so now the A-USA
want more than just you.

35:15.110 --> 35:17.030
Andrews, we had an agreement.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.130
I explained that.
When I made you the offer,

35:19.150 --> 35:21.020
I was planning on leaving the
Ravens

35:21.060 --> 35:22.060
out of the indictment.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.210
Son of a bitch.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.100
-Get a good lawyer and fight
this.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.120
Hold on.

35:28.140 --> 35:31.010
You think he could beat this?

35:31.030 --> 35:33.200
With Victor's testimony,
probably not.

35:33.220 --> 35:35.160
What if I testify
against the cartel?

35:35.180 --> 35:37.020
Stay out of this, Ramos.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.110
If I go into WITSEC...

35:39.130 --> 35:41.030
with my family,

35:41.050 --> 35:44.100
and I testify against
the cartel...

35:44.120 --> 35:46.020
would that be enough to make the
A-USA

35:46.060 --> 35:47.210
leave the rest of the Ravens
alone?

35:47.230 --> 35:49.140
Yeah, probably.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.140
You don't have to do this.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.200
I know.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.120
I want to.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.120
You're really just gonna
walk away from this?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.150
From Steve?

36:24.090 --> 36:26.040
I already have.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.140
And you should too.

36:30.220 --> 36:33.030
Nothing good has ever come
of this life.

36:34.060 --> 36:37.010
Things are bad right now...

36:37.030 --> 36:40.050
but it doesn't mean
that it's gonna stay this way.

36:40.070 --> 36:42.010
Well, I'm goin' to Carl's
tonight

36:42.050 --> 36:43.230
to say what needs to be said.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.030
And I just hope some of 'em--

36:48.190 --> 36:52.080
the ones who ain't brainwashed,
like  you--

36:52.100 --> 36:53.230
listen.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.210
Just give us a minute here,

37:35.010 --> 37:35.130
would ya?

37:39.190 --> 37:41.220
Visiting hours are over.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.230
I just wanted to let you know
that Ramos is safely with his

37:45.030 --> 37:45.130
family.

37:46.150 --> 37:48.050
Thanks.

38:25.150 --> 38:27.170
What about
the rest of my guys?

38:27.190 --> 38:29.160
You gonna look after 'em?

38:31.170 --> 38:32.210
Won't need to.

38:32.230 --> 38:36.060
Ignacio and Ricardo
won't be an issue.

38:37.230 --> 38:39.140
What about Carmen?

38:40.110 --> 38:43.060
According to my sources,
she's back in Colombia.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.040
And after what her
brother did...

38:46.060 --> 38:48.020
that's probably a bad move
on her part.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.230
Shut that shit down,
I got somethin' to say.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.070
Shut it down.

39:02.010 --> 39:05.100
I'm here to speak my piece,
then I'm gonna leave.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.130
Here we go.

39:06.150 --> 39:08.080
You see that?

39:08.100 --> 39:11.030
It's people like Kraley
you need to start ignoring.

39:11.050 --> 39:13.050
And people like my dad.

39:13.070 --> 39:15.150
And my brother.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.080
We need to atone, brother.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.030
This is our sins comin'
back on us.

39:22.050 --> 39:24.170
You better fuckin' fix this,
or I'll never see my daughter

39:24.210 --> 39:25.040
again!

39:27.140 --> 39:29.070
They were all a part
of the problem!

39:30.150 --> 39:32.050
And so was I.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.150
But not anymore.

39:35.180 --> 39:37.130
Hallelujah to that.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.140
You always have a choice.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.030
You just keep making
the wrong ones.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.180
When we first got into
this thing...

39:49.200 --> 39:51.220
we were like a family.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.050
Tell me something, Kraley.

39:54.070 --> 39:56.180
How do you think this ends, huh?
