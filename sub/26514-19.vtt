-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:
-[George] Mom, it looks very different.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.100
[Sam] Wow, she's made herself Fallon.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.978
We've been trying to nail
Blake Carrington for a long time.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.272
There's nothing that connects
Silvio Flores.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.691
I don't think I fully appreciated
how lucrative

00:24.774 --> 00:26.860
-the gambling business could be.
-I went to the FBI.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.862
The FBI who wants to send me to jail.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.239
They're trying to put Mike Jones in jail.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.240
[shouts]

00:32.323 --> 00:34.159
You always do the wrong thing.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.828
Your son doesn't fight back
because he's protective of you.

00:36.911 --> 00:40.331
I told the painters they could start
on my new office in an hour.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.541
You okay?

00:41.624 --> 00:44.502
"Liam Ridley writes book
about romance with It-girl"?

00:44.586 --> 00:47.130
People think this
is supposed to be Ashley?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.257
It's weird you want me
to parade around with my ex.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.341
What would people say?

00:50.425 --> 00:53.052
Your publisher putting out a book
about herself written by her ex?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.262
Not great optics.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.014
I started writing that book
to get over you.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.725
It turned out to be the best way
to tell you how I feel.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.269
I have a photo
that might interest your readers.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.730
[dance music playing]

01:10.361 --> 01:13.823
You, me, warm sands, strong drinks,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.284
maybe an afternoon skinny dip
under a waterfall.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.995
I have bad memories of Bora Bora.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.248
Okay. Well, how about a safari?

01:22.373 --> 01:24.417
Meghan and Prince Harry did it
for their second date.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.127
We could do it for our first.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.591
Are you sure you're not just trying
to run away from your mother's face?

01:32.300 --> 01:35.970
No. Copycat Freakshow hasn't left the loft
since the great reveal.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.097
So I'm hoping she stays there.

01:39.015 --> 01:43.019
The point is, we are finally doing this,
and I wanna make sure we do it right.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.688
Plus, we've been working so hard
on the launch of your book,

01:45.772 --> 01:47.106
we deserve a little break.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.859
Have I ever told you how sexy you are
when you talk about my book?

01:49.943 --> 01:50.902
Oh.

01:50.985 --> 01:55.073
Well, sales are on an upward thrust,

01:55.156 --> 01:57.075
and you've been rocking hard

01:57.158 --> 01:58.660
-Mm-hm.
-with the reviews.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.081
But in the interest of doing things right,

02:03.164 --> 02:06.918
maybe our first time shouldn't be here,
you know, with my dad down the hall.

02:07.752 --> 02:08.586
True.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.713
So we'll wait then.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.301
[cell phone buzzing]

02:18.096 --> 02:18.930
No.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.016
-What?
-What?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.560
Over a dozen bookstores

02:23.643 --> 02:25.937
have backed out of their orders
of <i>The Biggest Payday.</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:27.564
They're dropping like flies.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.941
-I thought we were getting good buzz.
-Hello?

02:31.484 --> 02:34.821
What's going on?
I mean, we're losing money by the second.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.407
What do you mean check TMZ?

02:39.826 --> 02:44.330
Oh, my God. Someone leaked a photo
of us kissing at the masquerade party.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.500
And now they're saying
that the book is about you, not Ashley.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.544
Wow, "Is this book really so bad

02:49.627 --> 02:52.213
that they had to fake a relationship
just to get people to buy it?"

02:52.297 --> 02:54.799
"Fallon Carrington thinks
she can dupe the public.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.886
Boycott Femperial books,
hashtag 'liar,' hashtag 'narcissist.'"

02:57.969 --> 02:58.970
I should've known better.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.598
Kissing in public, it's almost as bad
as leaking your own sex tape.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.684
We screwed up. And now we're screwed.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.562
I'm not gonna let these Internet trolls
tank our project

03:07.645 --> 03:09.230
or drag our relationship through the mud.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.065
You can't stop it. It's too late.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.360
If I can stop us from having sex,
then I can stop anything.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.990
Are we celebrating something?

03:19.073 --> 03:22.702
Peace between the Flores
and the Carrington families.

03:22.785 --> 03:26.372
I'm honestly surprised how easily
you and Papa took to the truce.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.625
Well, Silvio and I found
some common ground.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.376
-What? Cigars?
-You.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.712
Neither one of us
wants to see you get hurt.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.673
And we both wanna build a legacy
that includes you.

03:36.382 --> 03:41.012
So in the spirit of that, we have decided
to pursue a joint venture.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.973
Okay. <i>Mi amor,</i> we've been over this.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.517
He's not to be trusted,
especially not in business.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.187
Honey, I wasn't born yesterday, okay?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.272
This is mutually beneficial
to both families.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.984
We're bringing sports betting to Georgia.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.487
Through your family's business
and infrastructure,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.864
we should be ready to launch
by the Atlantix opening day.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.617
-Isn't gambling illegal in Georgia?
-Mm-hm.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.079
But the State Senate is voting on a bill
to legalize sports betting in a few days.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.581
It's down to one swing vote,
Senator Braden.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.626
I just need to apply the right pressure
to the right people,

04:11.709 --> 04:12.877
so the vote goes our way.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.338
Growing up with my father,

04:15.421 --> 04:18.091
I know a thing or two
about applying pressure.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.262
Are you offering to help me? We could have
some fun playing Bonnie and Clyde.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.180
As long as I get to be Bonnie.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.475
-You're no fun.
-[laughs]

04:28.101 --> 04:29.227
[chattering]

04:31.104 --> 04:32.855
As the CEO of Femperial,

04:32.939 --> 04:36.276
I am here today to address allegations
that we misled the public

04:36.359 --> 04:38.653
in promoting our book, <i>The Biggest Payday.</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:42.282
Well, I can confirm
that those allegations are true.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.784
I do have a personal relationship
with the author

04:44.867 --> 04:48.121
and the book is about me,
not Ashley Cunningham.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.374
I saw an opportunity
in the public's misconception,

04:51.457 --> 04:53.710
and I do regret
employing deceptive marketing

04:53.793 --> 04:57.088
to promote a book that can easily stand
on its own merits.

04:57.171 --> 05:00.883
Please, do not punish the author
or our Femperial team

05:00.967 --> 05:04.220
for a mistake that I made
as a first-time publisher.

05:05.138 --> 05:05.972
Thank you.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.348
[panting]

05:16.357 --> 05:18.359
Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.821
I'm not at your beck and call, Jeff.
I have work to do for the team.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.657
But there won't be a team
if we let Blake drag it down with him.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.076
Anyways, I figured it out.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.163
That list of names
we got from Blake's hard drive,

05:30.413 --> 05:32.332
they're all Georgia state politicians.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.791
Great. And?

05:34.375 --> 05:37.170
And I need you to figure out
how these politicians

05:37.253 --> 05:39.088
are linked to him or Silvio Flores.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.840
We can force Blake out of the owners' box

05:40.923 --> 05:43.426
with the money laundering evidence
we already have.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.971
Why put everything that you
have built in the hands of the feds?

05:47.055 --> 05:50.308
The FBI is the only way to make sure
we pull all of Blake's hooks,

05:50.391 --> 05:52.602
including the Flores family,
out of the team.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.646
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you like.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.734
What? You're gonna pull
the "Mike Jones, Ada Stone" card again?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.403
-Sell me out to the FBI?
-I don't want to.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.822
Just figure out what these names mean.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.831
<i>Please, do not punish the author...</i>
Overall, I think it worked out
better than I expected it to.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.170
Really? Because you were bragging
all morning

06:19.253 --> 06:21.130
about how your plan was such a sure thing.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.216
Well, the boycott is off,

06:23.299 --> 06:25.384
and now my open call
for accountability is trending.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.430
You're a meme now. Someone took your head
and pasted it over Britney's face

06:29.514 --> 06:31.265
in the "Work Bitch" video.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.935
Great. Just what I need.
My face on yet another broken woman.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.645
Look at the bright side.
She's doing great.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.522
She has a Vegas show. Great abs.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.734
Oh, speaking of abs,
you and me off to the Maldives?

06:41.818 --> 06:42.693
[Fallon] Not yet.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.404
First, we need to celebrate the book,
and then we can celebrate us.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.324
Plus, you should be working
on your speech for the launch party.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.409
Perhaps you'd like to make a dedication.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.871
But there's also a slime ball out there
who leaked our photo to the press,

06:53.955 --> 06:56.624
upon whom I need
to exact sweet, delicious revenge.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.417
Sam, it was your party.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.753
You want me to figure out
who took the photo?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.171
There were hundreds of people.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.341
[groans]

07:05.800 --> 07:06.717
Anders.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.179
You're also pretty sexy
when you're out for revenge.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.472
Go figure.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.728
Aw... You kiss so beautifully.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.441
I saw your photo
broke the Internet this morning.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.526
You must feel violated.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.321
That photo is nothing I can't handle.
In fact, I already have.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.949
[knocking on door]

07:32.910 --> 07:34.287
Hi. Can I help you?

07:34.370 --> 07:35.705
I need to speak to my son.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.457
[George] Uh...

07:37.582 --> 07:41.002
Oh, God, Liam.
Get your tongue out of that girl's throat.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.712
-Mom?
-I read your book.

07:42.795 --> 07:43.629
My dear friend,

07:43.713 --> 07:46.090
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
critic Michiko Kakutani,

07:46.174 --> 07:48.176
she slipped me her advanced copy.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.679
And I must say I'm offended,

07:52.263 --> 07:54.974
not only by your subpar writing,

07:55.558 --> 07:57.977
but by your slanderous portrayal of me.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.148
-So I have filed a lawsuit.
-[Liam] It's fiction, Mom.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.484
That book will never see the light of day.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.070
And I will tie up
your little vagina power company

08:08.154 --> 08:09.405
with so many lawsuits

08:09.489 --> 08:11.824
that you will never sign
another author again.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.159
Are you really that sad?

08:13.242 --> 08:15.661
What's sad is this little folly.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.664
So I will give you a choice.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.252
I will give up the lawsuit
if you give up my son.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.114
[George] Nice.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.576
Oh, sorry, Jeff.
Didn't mean to startle you.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.537
I just wanted to see what you did
with my office

08:57.620 --> 09:00.665
that you commandeered,
and it's so stylish.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.083
Way nicer than my new one.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.293
Yeah, that was the plan, all right? You--

09:04.877 --> 09:05.711
Damn it.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.465
Whoa, Jeff. You seem worked up

09:09.549 --> 09:12.385
and your eyes look a bit glassy.
Can I check your--?

09:12.468 --> 09:13.386
I'm fine, okay? Just...

09:13.469 --> 09:17.056
All right, look, I know we have bad blood
what with you being my father's adversary,

09:17.139 --> 09:20.893
but let's forget that right now.
I'm concerned about you as a doctor.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.895
See, your hands are shaking.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.899
You're sweating and your pulse is racing.
Just come sit down.

09:32.113 --> 09:36.826
Okay. All right. Sit back. Good.
Now, you wanna take some deep breaths.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.079
In, out. There we go.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.667
You just need to get some rest, all right?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.460
All right, everyone.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.589
The staff will provide the bone broth
and B12 shots you need,

09:49.672 --> 09:52.675
but remember, nobody leaves
until we figure this out.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.011
So think fast. All right.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.221
-Hi.
-This has to do with my mother?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.223
She wants a legal battle,
she's going to get one.

09:59.307 --> 10:03.144
We have civil and corporate litigation,
family law in the drawing room,

10:03.227 --> 10:05.980
and a couple from immigration,
just in case we find something juicy.

10:06.063 --> 10:10.901
I don't know. Going nuclear on my mom
is not the best way to handle her.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.529
She went nuclear first.
I know she hates me.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.532
But using your book,
your blood, sweat, and tears against us?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.534
It's low. Even by my standards.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.745
This is just gonna make things
even uglier.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.039
What do you suggest, Father Teresa?

10:23.122 --> 10:26.042
I suggest dinner, okay? With lots of wine.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.628
It is the WASP way.
There'll be verbal sparring,

10:28.711 --> 10:32.590
but in the end, I will talk her
off the ledge, as a loving son.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.924
I've already made reservations.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.885
-Great. Let me know how it goes.
-No.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.387
The three of us. You're coming.

10:43.017 --> 10:48.022
Blake, you are not going to believe
the photo I just found.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.982
Look, you'll love this.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.528
It's a photo of us just after Fallon
was born. I mean, look at Fallon.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.531
Oh, such a bundle of joy,
you know, before she could talk.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.868
And you, you were so handsome.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.411
We were so madly in love.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.247
Oh, I miss those days. Don't you?

11:06.290 --> 11:08.501
I don't know why we're taking
this trip down memory lane.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.295
I know you've been through a lot,
but I'm in the middle of something.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.216
Blake, I need your honest opinion,

11:15.299 --> 11:17.093
and I know you won't spare me.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.136
Is this what I look like now?

11:19.845 --> 11:23.391
Like a younger version of me
or do I, I mean...?

11:23.974 --> 11:27.103
Would you say
that I look more like Fallon?

11:28.813 --> 11:29.647
Really look.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.237
Uh...

11:38.697 --> 11:40.074
You are Fallon's mother.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.829
You are Fallon's mother, aren't you?
It's getting hard to tell these days.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.831
Blake, I'm serious.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.749
But it's a little late
to worry about it now.

11:49.333 --> 11:55.005
And you look fantastic for someone
who just face-planted into a fireplace.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.676
Alexis, I really have
to get some work done.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.094
Yeah.
I do too.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.622
[car beeps]

12:30.499 --> 12:33.002
Ow, ouch, ow, ow.

12:33.627 --> 12:37.256
Ma'am, are you okay? What happened?

12:38.382 --> 12:40.676
Is it broken? It feels broken.

12:40.759 --> 12:41.719
I can call 911.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.680
Oh, no. I was talking about my shoe.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.391
-Ah.
-It got stuck in the grate.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.809
Can you help me unlace it?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.854
Yeah. Sure.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.650
Slowly. I think I twisted my ankle.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.547
You know what?
I think it's loose enough for me to... Oh!

13:19.590 --> 13:20.716
-Thank you.
-Sure.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.093
I thought I'd be stuck there all night.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.846
Can I, um, walk you to your car?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.432
No, no, no. It's just around the corner.
Thank you.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.155
That performance
put Faye Dunaway to shame.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.157
And Beatty's got nothing on you, baby.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.162
You are looking well, Fallon.
Candlelight does wonders.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.832
Oh, I was about to say the same to you.
Have you had work done recently?

13:53.916 --> 13:56.752
See? This is nice, civilized.

13:56.835 --> 14:01.257
Almost as civil as civil court,
though I hear it's bring-your-own-candles.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.594
Can we get through one more bottle
before diving into all that, please?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.721
The wine won't make any difference.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.183
You might as well accept
that this relationship is going to end.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.770
And I'm just trying to save you
the pain of another divorce.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.816
You know what, Mom? Stop. We're together
and your lawsuit isn't gonna work.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.652
So if you wanna stay in my life,
accept that Fallon is a part of it too.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.865
Well, she has clearly wasted no time
in rotting your brain

14:25.948 --> 14:28.534
with this new disrespectful attitude.

14:28.617 --> 14:32.079
I have just lost my appetite.
Laura, go ahead and file your lawsuit.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.497
It has zero legal merit,

14:33.581 --> 14:35.875
and I will slap you
with so many countersuits

14:35.958 --> 14:38.919
that you will not see
the outside of a courthouse for years.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.838
I don't have years.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.049
It's this illness of mine.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.510
It has made me overly emotional,

14:46.594 --> 14:49.013
and everything that is happening
is my fault.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.347
What?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.768
I was just trying to get you to myself

14:55.519 --> 14:59.690
and spend the few months
that I have left with my son.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.653
Liam, I have cancer.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.705
Oh, there you are.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.166
Take a look.

15:17.708 --> 15:18.792
At what?

15:18.876 --> 15:21.921
I'm trying a few tweaks,
now we barely even look related.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.464
Do you need new eyes too?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.884
Darling, please.
You never wear a dark lip.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.553
Okay. Come here. Let's compare, shall we?

15:29.637 --> 15:32.681
You are the one on the right,
in case you're confused.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.850
And if you think a pair of sunglasses
and a dark lip

15:34.934 --> 15:37.645
will be enough for me to let this go,
then your face isn't the problem.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.021
Your brain is.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.022
Fallon...

15:40.564 --> 15:43.192
Until you stop lying to yourself,
we are done.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.028
I already have enough on my plate
with manipulative Mommy Van Kirk.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.073
I don't need your crazy too.
So you and I will never be seen

15:49.156 --> 15:50.574
in public together again.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.995
No. Tell them no plus-ones, no exceptions.

15:56.956 --> 15:57.957
-Hi.
-Hey.
I missed you last night.

16:00.084 --> 16:04.713
Oh, sorry. I just wanted to stay
with my mom after, you know, the news.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.676
Of course. Did she tell you
any more about her diagnosis?

16:08.759 --> 16:11.595
Apparently, she's been doing chemo
for a couple of weeks,

16:11.679 --> 16:13.764
but it hasn't been going well.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.016
So the future is... It's murky.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.059
Mm.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.020
I might have to go back
to New York for a while.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.273
-Without me?
-Look, we can long-distance it.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.692
When has that ever worked?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.986
Look, if she really has cancer,

16:27.069 --> 16:28.904
-then we should just--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.990
-What do you mean "if"?
-I don't know.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.410
-Just the timing is a little convenient.
-Are you hearing yourself?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.413
My mom might be difficult,
but she's still human.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.165
Even she's not cruel enough
to lie about that.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.751
No, no, no. You are right.

16:43.335 --> 16:47.589
I get that you're upset. Okay? I am too.
I wanna figure out something.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.052
I am willing to do whatever it takes.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.305
In fact, why don't I take her out
for a day at the spa?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.016
Maybe pampering will make her feel better.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.810
You're actually offering
to spend a day with my mom?

16:59.893 --> 17:02.730
I would rather take painting lessons
from John Wayne Gacy, but, yeah,

17:02.813 --> 17:06.358
if you and I are headed for the endgame,
then I have to least try and win her over.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.111
That's totally Derek, isn't it?

17:09.611 --> 17:12.448
I mean, he did let himself go
after his ex got engaged.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.325
Those are some tight pants. [groans]

17:15.784 --> 17:18.454
Okay. Three down, 477 to go.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.788
Are you conferring with Bo?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.957
No. He's actually useless.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.167
I'm trying to match the guests
with their masks,

17:24.251 --> 17:27.337
so I can identify and eliminate
everyone in the photo as suspects.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.423
If they're in the photo,
they couldn't have taken it.

17:29.506 --> 17:33.135
By the time you're done, Fallon
could be four scandals past this one.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.012
No one likes a hater, Anders.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.974
I could call a contact at TMZ
and find out who leaked the picture.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.812
-Well, that's basic.
-Some might say elementary.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.067
Fine. It is a good idea.
But if we're playing roles, you're Watson.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.276
[whimpers]

17:53.447 --> 17:55.324
-What is this?
-Alpha-wave stimulator.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.534
You'll sleep like a baby tonight.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.913
When you said spa treatments,
I was thinking body wraps,

18:00.996 --> 18:03.040
not science experiments. In my condition--

18:03.123 --> 18:06.543
Your condition is exactly why I booked
the Diamond Healing packages,

18:06.627 --> 18:11.381
LStim bed, cryo-body wrap,
oxygen infusion, PRP, microneedling.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.093
Sounds deadly. Are you trying
to hasten my departure?

18:14.176 --> 18:17.096
This is cutting edge
and only available to elite circles.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.972
I know what you're doing.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.851
You're trying to suck up,
which wouldn't be necessary

18:22.935 --> 18:26.605
unless Liam was seriously considering
coming back to New York with me.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.358
Quite the opposite.
I was just feeling sorry for you.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.737
Since time is so precious,
why not develop a meaningful relationship

18:33.821 --> 18:36.990
between a dying mother
and an ex-wife-slash-girlfriend?

18:37.783 --> 18:38.826
[woman] All right, ladies.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.037
We're gonna start
with our plasma-rich platelet procedure.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.873
We're gonna draw your blood,
spin it to oxygenate,

18:44.957 --> 18:47.084
and inject the healthy blood cells
back into your system

18:47.167 --> 18:49.211
or wherever you need healing the most.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.587
-Ooh, fun.
-Who wants to go first?

18:50.671 --> 18:51.505
Oh--

18:51.839 --> 18:54.466
Sick past-and-future mother-in-laws first.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.596
I got it.
This is all about the sports betting bill.

18:59.680 --> 19:05.727
These senators are all key voters,
including one who was publicly undecided.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.898
And Blake is somehow tied to all of this.
It's just...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.984
-Jeff? Jeff.
-The partnering.
-What is this?
-If it isn't Mike Jones.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.241
Did you find that missing piece?
Because the clock is ticking.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.994
-I'm still working on it.
-I need that link, okay?

19:22.077 --> 19:25.330
I just can't see it,
but it goes right here.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.417
-With the Flores family and the kiosks.
-What?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.252
The kiosks, the kiosks.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
Are you feeling okay?
Maybe you need to sit down.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.800
-It's all good.
-No, no. You don't seem all good.

19:36.884 --> 19:40.929
If Blake sees you or the FBI,
you seem a little loose, man.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.806
Well, help me then, okay?

19:42.890 --> 19:47.436
Find out about those senators,
or the feds will be seeing you tomorrow.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.478
Bright and early.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.821
Got it?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.448
A Carrington always pays her debts.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.785
Thank you.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
-Uh, short of breath?
-Yeah.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.518
I just, uh...

20:28.936 --> 20:31.480
-I just need some water.
-Good idea.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.441
Severe dehydration
can lead to disorientation.

20:34.524 --> 20:38.195
You know, Jeff, like all doctors,
I took the Hippocratic Oath.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.113
You know, do no harm.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.367
But you're not really my patient.

20:43.951 --> 20:49.456
And is it really doing harm
if you're not doing anything at all?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.001
It's a real philosophical question.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.796
I was always better at chemistry.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.758
Now, if you come at Blake
and me like that again,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.302
next time I won't make this phone call.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.810
Hi, I just found my colleague
passed out in his office.

21:09.893 --> 21:10.769
He's not moving.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.020
Please hurry.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.815
I should know any time.
Our meeting is in a few minutes.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.276
I'll speak to you after. Adios, Silvio.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.571
-I didn't realize anyone was still here.
-So, I'm glad I caught you.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.240
We need to talk.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.993
-It's important.
-What did you screw up this time?

21:26.076 --> 21:27.160
It's not my screw-up.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.455
Whoever did and whatever it is,
I don't have time to clean it up.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.208
I have an important meeting,
so, why don't you deal with it?

21:34.501 --> 21:35.335
You're right.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.753
-I'll handle it myself.
-Good.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.757
[woman] Blake, this is Senator Braden.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.719
Mr. Carrington, so nice to meet you.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.346
-It's a pleasure to see you.
-[Braden] Thank you.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.514
Shall we speak?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.812
It looks like everything
is healing nicely.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.730
How do you feel?

21:55.439 --> 21:59.651
Well, actually, I was hoping
that I could make a few tweaks.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.529
You know, maybe a brow lift
or a little lip injection.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.032
It's too risky, Mrs. Carrington.
You're still healing.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.533
I'm happy to pay extra.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.704
Unless perhaps there's something else
that you might like. [chuckles]

22:10.787 --> 22:14.458
You're having an adrenaline withdrawal
from surgery.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.542
It can be addictive.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.378
You think I enjoy
getting all this painful work done?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.047
No, it's just that...

22:20.756 --> 22:23.300
I don't know,
this face, it's not working for me.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.594
I... I look like someone else.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.431
I think our team did a tremendous job
giving you exactly what you asked for.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.851
What I asked for? What--? When?

22:32.934 --> 22:34.978
I know it can be difficult
to recall everything

22:35.062 --> 22:38.356
given all the pain meds,
but, um, this was given to us

22:38.440 --> 22:40.192
as a basis for your surgery.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.278
Because you had difficulty speaking,
your son passed it along.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.158
[gasps]

22:50.077 --> 22:51.912
[jazz music playing on speakers]

22:57.626 --> 23:00.420
With reviews calling him
the next Jonathan Safran Foer,

23:00.504 --> 23:03.340
and the statement I released yesterday,
we are very close

23:03.465 --> 23:06.218
to cracking
the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.763
Will you excuse me for just one second?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.184
What are you doing here?
You're not on the guest list.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.186
I just wanna celebrate your big night.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.312
Oh, yeah. Okay.

23:17.395 --> 23:20.982
Well, please try not to roofie anyone
and keep the creep factor minimal.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.236
Over here. Fantastic.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.155
Hey. Hi.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.034
-There's the man of the hour.
-Fallon, this-- This is incredible.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.037
-Better than anything I could've imagined.
-[Laura] Really?

23:34.121 --> 23:38.792
All the guests look like they stumbled out
of an episode of <i>The Real Housewives</i>.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.293
-So tacky.
-[Fallon] Laura.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.171
I'm surprised
that you're joining us tonight.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.965
That PRP treatment did wonders.

23:45.048 --> 23:48.135
Anything to make you comfortable
before your flight tomorrow.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.929
Well, Liam will be traveling with me.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.390
So, he'll make sure
that I'm plenty comfortable.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.767
What? You're leaving, too?

23:56.726 --> 23:58.645
Can I borrow him for just a second?

23:59.563 --> 24:00.438
Yeah.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.356
Be right back.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.902
So, you're leaving
but you're coming back, right?
-As soon as I'm able to, yes.
-You mean as soon as she lets you.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.033
Look, Fallon... I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

24:12.117 --> 24:14.119
if I didn't try to develop
a meaningful relationship

24:14.202 --> 24:15.871
with my mother while I still can.
We had a great talk on the way here.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.333
And she wants to clear the slate,
make new memories.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.420
Wow, I mean, she will just say
anything to keep us apart.

24:23.503 --> 24:26.089
You have to stop
with these conspiracies, okay?

24:26.882 --> 24:29.176
She's sick and just wants
to spend time with her son.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.104
[groans]

24:43.356 --> 24:46.526
My contact at TMZ
couldn't confirm the source of the photo,

24:46.610 --> 24:48.195
it came from an anonymous address.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.864
Hmm. This guy is good... or girl.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.659
-At least we have the big picture.
-Big picture? We hardly know anything.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.995
No. He literally sent a bigger picture.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.914
-They cropped it for publication.
-Oh.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.248
I'm forwarding it to you now.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.333
[cell phone beeps]
Okay. Got it.

25:03.001 --> 25:06.338
There's a lot more people in this one.
We can rule out more guests.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.131
[Anders]
I think we can do better than that.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.049
[Sam] Oh.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.051
I'd recognize that tailoring anywhere.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.427
It's iconic.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.931
-It's me... and I'm taking a selfie.
-Mm.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.599
What a surprise.

25:17.682 --> 25:21.478
The good news for us is that selfie
is the reverse angle of this photograph.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.647
If we can find the selfie,
we'll know who did it.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.564
Clever.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.192
Okay, no problem.
I'll go through my photos.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.027
All five million of them?

25:29.611 --> 25:32.239
I like taking photos of myself, okay?
I'm photogenic.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.492
In fact... take a picture of me
while going through my pictures.

25:37.118 --> 25:37.953
Okay.
Looking.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.455
[glass clinking]

25:42.082 --> 25:43.541
Hello, everybody.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.879
Thank you for coming out to support
Femperial's inaugural book with us.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.674
And without further ado,
I would like to introduce

25:50.757 --> 25:51.967
its brilliant author,

25:52.550 --> 25:55.095
a man that I am simply mad about.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.304
Liam Ridley.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.430
[crowd applauding]

26:03.478 --> 26:08.233
Uh, first off, I just wanna say
that I appreciate all of your support.

26:08.316 --> 26:12.112
And I'm so happy to have found
a home with Femperial.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.533
Now, there's someone that I would like
to acknowledge tonight,

26:16.616 --> 26:17.909
because without her...

26:19.244 --> 26:20.996
well, none of this
would have been possible.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.415
So... I'm dedicating my book

26:23.498 --> 26:26.334
to a very special woman in my life.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.461
My mother, Laura.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.630
Uh, she's here this evening, and I'm...

26:31.756 --> 26:34.259
I'm happy that I could share
this moment with her.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.468
Thank you.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.761
[crowd applauding]

26:43.852 --> 26:46.146
Wow, I really thought
he was gonna dedicate the book to you.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.065
But I suppose the bond
between mother and son is undeniable.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.860
Can't you go find a dark corner
to lurk in?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.278
[cell phone buzzing]

27:01.619 --> 27:02.454
Hey, Laura.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.165
Congratulations.
We need to have a chat.

27:15.842 --> 27:16.676
[groans]

27:16.801 --> 27:18.845
How many more selfies do you have?

27:18.928 --> 27:22.849
I could've finished binge-watching
the entire series of <i>Neighbours</i> by now.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.100
Oh, my God.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.603
-You found something?
-My new profile picture.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.688
The old one doesn't reflect
the new me anymore.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.606
Okay.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.983
Wait. Here it is.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.610
Found it.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.074
I remember that mask.
I had nightmares about it. That's...

27:41.284 --> 27:42.452
Adam.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.872
Before we start pointing fingers
at our own family,

27:45.955 --> 27:47.082
we need to be certain.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.168
We need to prove
that he leaked that photo.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.754
Look at us, detectiving.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.673
We should document this with a selfie.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.342
Okay, ready?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
[camera clicks]
Love it.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.310
You.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.814
-How could you be so cruel?
-Mother, what are you--?

28:10.897 --> 28:13.274
Burning me was terrifying, yes.

28:13.525 --> 28:18.154
But I've almost learned to justify my son
lashing out after years of abandonment.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.366
But then I find out
that you made me look like this?
-I didn't.
-I got this from the surgeon.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.372
All right, this was...

28:28.998 --> 28:30.583
This was supposed to be a gift.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.877
You looked so much like Fallon
when you were younger.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.629
I was trying to do something nice for you.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.215
I was trying to make up
for the fire incident.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.259
Stop lying, Adam.

28:39.384 --> 28:43.012
You have been trying to destroy
my relationship with Fallon.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.348
And now--
Well, I can't help but feel that...

28:45.932 --> 28:48.351
maybe it would've been better
if you had never come at all.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.603
Please, don't say that.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.647
I got jealous. I admit it.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.734
All I've ever wanted was your love.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.653
And you and Fallon are so close.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.614
When all that she ever is to me
is mean and callous.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.908
That doesn't mean
that you can do this, Adam.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.411
I know and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for the way I am.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.456
But you have no idea how hard it was

29:09.539 --> 29:12.250
being brought up
by some sick addict as a mother.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.253
When I learned about you and-- And...

29:16.838 --> 29:17.714
I finally had hope.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.675
Hope that I'd be-- I would...

29:21.551 --> 29:23.428
get the love that I always craved.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.346
So, please don't--

29:28.892 --> 29:31.352
[sobbing] Please don't push me away.
No, I just found you.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.108
What is this all about, Fallon?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.985
People are praising my son.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.988
And I would like to be there
to hear it while I still can.

29:42.572 --> 29:43.698
You can drop the Big C act.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.075
I know it's all fake.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.703
-Excuse me?
-That PRP treatment?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.830
You didn't think
I was trying to be nice, did you?

29:51.122 --> 29:54.751
No. I had some vials of your blood
tested for traces of chemo.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.212
And it came back as clean as a newborn's.

29:58.671 --> 29:59.631
You stole my blood?

29:59.714 --> 30:01.758
And you are the one accusing me
of doing something

30:01.841 --> 30:05.470
so utterly loathsome
as pretending to be terminally ill?

30:05.553 --> 30:09.015
Okay. Stop making a scene
at your own son's book launch.

30:09.098 --> 30:09.933
Making a scene?

30:10.767 --> 30:11.935
I'll show you a scene.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.104
Excuse me.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.357
Hello, everyone.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.318
As mother of the author...

30:21.820 --> 30:23.238
I'd like to say a few words.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.281
This is a bittersweet evening, because...

30:25.365 --> 30:28.701
this could be the last book launch
of my son's...

30:29.160 --> 30:30.411
that I may be able to attend.

30:30.495 --> 30:34.833
You see... I was just recently diagnosed
with stage 4 cancer.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.000
[chattering]

30:36.084 --> 30:37.377
I know.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.714
And if that weren't awful enough,
my son's girlfriend...

30:42.841 --> 30:43.967
Fallon Carrington...

30:44.759 --> 30:46.970
is accusing me of lying
about my diagnosis.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.388
[Fallon] All right.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.223
Let's hear it for Laura, everyone.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.558
Laura.

30:51.641 --> 30:52.475
I got it.

30:54.018 --> 30:54.853
Thank you.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.481
Well, I'm sorry for that interruption.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.024
Let's get back to the party.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.109
Okay.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.695
No. No, I would like to say one thing.

31:04.445 --> 31:07.282
Laura, here... is a liar.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.784
I have test results that prove

31:09.868 --> 31:11.995
there is no trace of chemo in her body,

31:12.078 --> 31:15.164
even though she claims
that she is undergoing treatment, okay?

31:15.248 --> 31:16.666
Right here. Take a look.

31:16.749 --> 31:17.792
It says it right there.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.502
She is a manipulative liar

31:19.586 --> 31:21.462
and she's only doing it
to break Liam and I apart

31:21.546 --> 31:22.797
because she is a monster.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.424
She's a monster who--

31:25.091 --> 31:26.926
I'm the monster? She stole my blood.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.678
-I--
-She stole my blood.

31:29.971 --> 31:34.100
And, yes, it is clean, but that's only
because I have stopped chemotherapy.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.145
I was having a-- A bad reaction.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.689
And you know what?

31:40.523 --> 31:42.609
Would you like to see the CT scan?

31:44.152 --> 31:45.111
There.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.487
[chuckles]

31:47.030 --> 31:47.864
It's--

31:47.989 --> 31:48.990
-No.
-Uh-huh.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.742
Does this look fake to you?

31:50.825 --> 31:51.659
[sighs]

31:52.994 --> 31:56.414
She could've pulled that
from anywhere, guys. Liam?

31:56.497 --> 31:57.415
No, Fallon, don't.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.499
[Laura crying]

31:59.334 --> 32:02.295
-I've seen enough. Come on.
-I'm sorry.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.759
[woman] Do you have any comments?

32:07.842 --> 32:09.218
[man] Fallon, is this true?

32:10.303 --> 32:12.597
Gambling is inherently immoral.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.975
And I didn't come to the state capital
to encourage it.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.645
Well, senator, I hear your concerns.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.229
And I'm familiar...

32:21.064 --> 32:22.774
with your moral crusade at the capitol.

32:22.857 --> 32:26.110
You ran on an anti-gun platform as well,
if I'm not mistaken.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.029
-That's right.
-So it would be, uh...

32:28.655 --> 32:31.282
quite a scandal
if the Georgia State Troopers

32:31.366 --> 32:34.827
were tipped off about your husband,
and then found a firearm

32:34.911 --> 32:36.913
with an illegal silencer in his glove box?

32:36.996 --> 32:37.956
Excuse me?

32:39.082 --> 32:41.084
-Is this some kind of game?
-Mm. Sort of.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.461
Except we can both win here.

32:43.544 --> 32:46.297
You can go home,
take that gun out of his car,

32:46.381 --> 32:47.632
and bury it in the backyard.

32:48.257 --> 32:51.302
You can go and vote in favor
of the gambling bill tomorrow.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.639
You don't wanna find the other Easter eggs
we've hidden for you,

32:54.847 --> 32:55.974
at your law firm...

32:56.641 --> 32:57.934
in your mother's garden.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.895
Her roses are coming in so nicely.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.023
-I've never been able to grow them myself.
-No?

33:04.983 --> 33:05.817
So...

33:06.901 --> 33:08.611
shall we discuss that vote again?

33:36.806 --> 33:37.765
There you are.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.809
Are you okay?

33:40.309 --> 33:41.686
-Did someone die?
-No.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.773
Just my pride and my relationship,
and maybe Laura Van Kirk soon.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.568
Man, I really did miss
a good party, didn't I?

33:48.651 --> 33:49.736
Yeah, where were you?

33:49.819 --> 33:51.571
I've never known you
to skip out on anything.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.614
Not even Tony the gardener's
cat <i>quinceañera.</i>

33:53.698 --> 33:57.577
Sam and I were busy looking for proof
before we shared our findings.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.037
You are not going to believe this.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.457
You probably will,
'cause you think the worst of people.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.835
Adam, he took and leaked the photo
of you and Liam kissing.

34:06.836 --> 34:07.962
Boy Interrupted?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.424
Well, he is annoying... and weird.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.135
He stares at you unwittingly,
which I heard is a psychopathic trait.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.471
All personality assessments aside,

34:17.054 --> 34:18.764
we do have actual evidence.

34:18.889 --> 34:23.018
Sam borrowed Adam's laptop
while he was at the party.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.313
I had a discreet tech service,
give us full access.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.773
And as you can see,

34:26.856 --> 34:29.567
he's the one who e-mailed
the photo to TMZ.

34:30.150 --> 34:32.612
Brother dearest is so dead.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.239
I don't want to encourage fratricide,
but it does get worse.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.534
We found some interesting texts.
You're not gonna like
who he has been cozying up to.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.626
[both breathing heavily]

34:49.754 --> 34:51.505
That was very pleasant.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.424
And illegal in some states, I think.

34:53.716 --> 34:54.550
Ha, ha.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.013
Yeah, teaming up was a game changer.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.141
I am so glad
that you reached out when you did.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.142
Well...

35:03.226 --> 35:06.521
-that cancer idea we came up with.
-Genius.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.357
You pulled those medical records
out of thin air.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.399
Poof.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.277
Old patient records come in handy
every now and then.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.863
Mm. You are very resourceful, aren't you?

35:26.707 --> 35:27.750
[Sam sighs]

35:28.042 --> 35:29.877
You are not gonna guess
what just happened.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.339
-Something tells me I won't have to.
-Fallon paid me for sleuthing.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.049
She didn't pay me, pay me like with money.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.302
But she paid me
with a trip to the Maldives.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.471
She was supposed to go with Liam,
but now he's mad.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.597
She has to deal with Adam.

35:41.681 --> 35:45.643
So, since I saved the day,
she said I deserve a vacation.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.228
You saved the day?

35:47.311 --> 35:50.231
Okay, of course, yes. We saved the day.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.024
That's why you're coming with me.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.610
You deserve a vacation as much as I do.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.321
Did someone say boy's trip?

35:57.697 --> 35:58.614
Yeah.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.500
There she is
with her tail between her legs.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.543
Liam's not here.

36:10.751 --> 36:11.586
I know.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.796
He always goes to yoga before a flight.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.715
I wanted to talk to you.

36:16.215 --> 36:17.049
Alone.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.177
Woman to woman.

36:20.303 --> 36:24.515
Well, make it fast because my son and I
have a plane to catch.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.268
I know you lied.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.729
-What are you talking--?
-I have proof.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.399
Text exchanges with my brother,
who provided the faux CT-scan.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.818
Okay.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.571
So, you caught me.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.533
I only did it because I am trying
to protect my weakling son,

36:43.117 --> 36:44.452
who is too weak to fend off trash.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.871
You are not good enough for him.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.624
No, no, no. I am not good enough for you,
and there is a difference.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.752
But I'm not afraid of you
and I don't care.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.295
And you know that and you hate it

36:54.378 --> 36:57.256
because it rubs off on Liam,
which gives you less control over him.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.091
Let's cut the bad therapy crap.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.259
What do you want?

37:00.343 --> 37:02.386
I am going to give you a choice, Laura.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.513
Either I tell Liam the truth,

37:04.597 --> 37:07.725
which would destroy your already
fragile relationship with him,

37:07.934 --> 37:11.395
or you can generate good will
by choosing to come clean on your own.

37:11.979 --> 37:14.732
Just tell him that you were desperate
for his love and affection,

37:14.815 --> 37:18.194
make up some excuse
that will help him forgive you eventually.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.363
Why?

37:20.988 --> 37:23.241
Why aren't you using this
to make Liam resent me more?

37:24.617 --> 37:26.535
Because I know what it's like
to hate your mother.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.246
And I don't want that for Liam.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.499
But, hey...

37:32.166 --> 37:33.167
one silver lining...

37:33.960 --> 37:35.670
at least you're cancer-free.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.595
I was told that you're desperate to chat.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.098
What do you want now?
A wig made out of my hair?

37:47.181 --> 37:49.475
Thank you for being willing to talk...

37:50.226 --> 37:51.310
especially with all this.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.603
Maybe don't highlight it.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.107
I know that this face
has caused you a lot of trouble.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.150
I'm going to make this right.

37:58.234 --> 38:01.529
The world's best plastic surgeon
will be reconstructing a new face for me.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.239
I leave for Europe immediately.
You've finally come to your senses.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.702
I'll be gone a while.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.662
But before I go,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.456
I was hoping I could talk to you
about your brother.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.542
Quit while you're ahead.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.294
He's worse than you know, Fallon.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.046
He's the reason that I have your face.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.840
He gave the surgeon your photo.

38:20.923 --> 38:23.801
-He what?
-Just promise me that you won't cross him.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.970
I love you too much to see you get hurt.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.430
I won't get hurt.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.265
Adam, on the other hand--

38:29.348 --> 38:32.852
Fallon, he might be disturbed
and unbalanced.

38:32.935 --> 38:36.105
But-- I mean, he's my son
and I blame myself.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.816
I never should've stopped looking for him.
Promise me

38:39.108 --> 38:42.486
that you will stay away from him,
and do not tell him that I'm gone.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.364
Of course.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.868
You go get a new face.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.162
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:55.374 --> 38:56.459
[champagne cork pops]

38:57.126 --> 38:58.252
I just got word.

38:59.628 --> 39:03.591
Sports betting... is now legal
in the state of Georgia.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.927
Your father's gambling kiosks
will be installed before our opening game.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.096
And I just got a text from Papa.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.806
He never reaches out.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.225
He wanted to say he's happy with us.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.810
Thumbs up emoji, that's a first.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.062
Emoji or the happy?

39:16.145 --> 39:16.979
Both.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.149
Mm.

39:21.942 --> 39:24.445
Let's get to the part of Bonnie and Clyde

39:24.528 --> 39:26.030
they don't show on television.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.115
That's my favorite part.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.082
Can I help you?

39:36.457 --> 39:38.876
I think you've been looking for me
in the Ada Stone case.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.128
I'm Mike Jones.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.547
Mike Jones?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.341
You're just waltzing in here? That's bold.

39:45.925 --> 39:46.759
It's not bold.
It's smart.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.639
I realize I gotta do things my way
and my way only.

39:52.473 --> 39:53.974
So, I'm here to make an immunity deal.

39:54.725 --> 39:58.813
I've got everything you need to catch
a much bigger fish than me or Ada Stone.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.815
What kind of fish?

40:01.899 --> 40:02.900
Blake Carrington.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.034
[Liam] Fallon.

40:13.202 --> 40:16.080
So, I just spoke to my mother.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.374
She confessed everything.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.042
She lied about the cancer.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.420
-No way.
-I don't know.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.546
Don't act so surprised.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.341
My mom doesn't usually
own up to things or apologize.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.802
So, I got the sense that someone

40:30.094 --> 40:31.887
gave her a not-so-subtle nudge.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.764
I have no idea.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.060
I'm sorry. I should've believed you
from the beginning.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.521
I'm so grateful that you tried
to make everything okay

40:40.604 --> 40:43.774
between me and my mom,
even if she was awful.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.277
Well, you shouldn't judge her too harshly.

40:46.360 --> 40:48.028
She did have help from the devil himself.

40:48.904 --> 40:49.905
What does that mean?

40:50.781 --> 40:51.866
Don't worry about it.

40:52.366 --> 40:57.121
Right now... I think you and I deserve
to take a beat and just focus on us.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.249
Pretend we're in the Maldives,
order rum cocktails,

41:00.332 --> 41:04.211
and take a PG-13 skinny dip
in my thousand-thread-count sheets.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.297
PG-13, huh?

41:06.380 --> 41:07.214
Yeah.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.508
[Talking Heads' "Wild Wild Life" playing]

41:13.471 --> 41:15.473
I have to take care of one thing first.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.561
-Brother dearest.
-[chuckles]

41:21.312 --> 41:22.646
How uncharacteristically sweet.

41:23.814 --> 41:27.568
-You want some cake? I'll share.
-Actually, I just came from the loft.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.695
I had a real heart-to-heart with Mom.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.739
Great... Oh, that's wonderful.

41:31.822 --> 41:35.242
I know she was troubled
by your strong reaction to her surgery.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.120
Yes. We're putting all of that behind us.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.956
And in the spirit of family
and fresh starts,

41:41.290 --> 41:42.583
I think we should try again, too.

41:42.666 --> 41:46.003
Consider it a truce of sorts, for Mom.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.506
I didn't know we were at war.

41:49.924 --> 41:53.511
But of course we can start fresh,
no victory more important than family.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.763
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.933
You know what?
I would actually love some cake.

42:00.976 --> 42:01.810
Thanks, bro.
