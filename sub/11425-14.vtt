OF THE REST OF THE CREW.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.295
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, WE GOT TWO STRINGS HERE.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.705
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD
BE FIRST TO DO IT

12:54.707 --> 12:56.207
OR WHAT YOU GUYS
WANT TO FIGURE OUT,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.776
BUT EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.082
I'LL DO IT.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.517
I'LL DO THE FIRST ONE.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.955
OH, LOOK AT ALL
THAT EXCITEMENT.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.391
LOOKS LIKE ZACK GAVE UP
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY,

13:13.393 --> 13:15.860
WHICH I'M DISAPPOINTED.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.228
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
GETTING A SHOT

13:17.230 --> 13:20.665
AT MAYBE BEING THE CAPTAIN
OF ONE OF THESE BOATS,

13:20.667 --> 13:23.935
AND THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC THING
HE CAN SAY OR DO IS GO...

13:28.041 --> 13:29.574
I DON'T KNOW.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.476
I WAS SURE CUT
FROM A DIFFERENT MOLD.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.746
THIS ISN'T A RACE TO ME AT ALL.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.249
NO COMPETITION HERE IN MY MIND.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.417
WELL, IF IT IS,
I'M ALREADY AHEAD.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.219
I ALREADY RAN
A BOAT THIS SUMMER.

13:41.221 --> 13:45.556
SO 30 POTS REALLY ISN'T
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.692
Bill: WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.894
HELLO.

13:49.896 --> 13:53.264
HOW DID THE CONVERSATION GO ON
WHO WAS GONNA RUN GEAR FIRST?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.665
IT WASN'T MUCH
OF A CONVERSATION.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.467
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"I'M DOING IT FIRST."

13:59.138 --> 14:00.871
GUESS WE COULD'VE FLIPPED
A COIN OR SOMETHING,

14:00.873 --> 14:02.440
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.842
I'M JUMPING TO RUN THE BOAT,
SO...

14:04.844 --> 14:06.644
WELL, ANYWAY,

14:06.646 --> 14:11.315
SO WHAT WE GOT HERE IS,
THERE ARE 16 POTS.

14:11.317 --> 14:14.051
WE'RE GONNA START AT THE WEST.
THEY'RE THE RED MARKS.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.519
OKAY.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.054
ALL RIGHT.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.510
DON'T RUN THEM OVER, NICK.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.713
BREAK A LEG, BUDDY.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.149
YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

14:50.156 --> 14:54.058
MY DREAM AS A LITTLE KID

14:54.060 --> 14:57.194
WERE TO BE A CAPTAIN
OF A CRAB BOAT.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.597
IF BILL IS GOING TO OPEN UP
A DOOR LIKE THAT,

14:59.599 --> 15:01.866
I'M GONNA JUMP THROUGH IT.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.135
EVERYTHING'S
A COMPETITION OUT HERE.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.704
ZACK AND I DRIVING A BOAT,
THAT'S A COMPETITION.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.475
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS
IN ZACK'S SHOES,

15:11.477 --> 15:15.579
I WOULD BE UPPING MY GAME
SUBSTANTIALLY.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.549
I WOULD FEEL THREATENED
IF I WAS ZACK.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.221
Narrator: 75 MILES EAST...

15:24.223 --> 15:26.991
Man: WE'RE GONNA DROP RIGHT
IN THE HONEY HOLE, BABY.

15:26.993 --> 15:30.027
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

15:30.029 --> 15:32.596
Narrator:
...ON THE 155-FOOT <i> WIZARD...</i>

15:32.598 --> 15:34.465
Keith:
WE'VE GOT 84 POTS ON BOARD,

15:34.467 --> 15:38.402
AND WE'RE SETTING THESE OFF
DOWN TOWARDS THE EDGE.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.306
Narrator:
AFTER STACKING AND MOVING
100 MILES SOUTHEAST...

15:42.308 --> 15:45.209
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
FRESH GROUNDS, FRESH BOTTOM.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.945
AND WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A FRESH START.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.914
Narrator: ...CAPTAIN KEITH
HAS A DAY AND A HALF

15:49.916 --> 15:51.682
BEFORE HE HAS TO HEAD TO PORT...

15:51.684 --> 15:53.451
Keith: <i> LET'S GO AHEAD AND START</i>
<i>SETTING OFF THE STERN.</i>

15:53.453 --> 15:55.753
WE'VE GOTTA REALLY CHEW
THROUGH THEM FAST.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.190
Narrator: ...AND HAND OVER THE
HELM TO YOUNGER BROTHER MONTE.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.158
-GOING OVER!
-GOING OVER EMPTY!

16:01.160 --> 16:02.593
COMING BACK FULL, BABY!

16:02.595 --> 16:04.862
Roger: WE WERE HAULING,
YOU KNOW, FIVES AND SIXES,

16:04.864 --> 16:07.465
HOPING WE'LL GET 30s AND 40s,
AT LEAST. WE CAN WORK WITH THAT.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.433
WE HAVEN'T REALLY
HIT THE JACKPOT YET.

16:09.435 --> 16:13.371
WE NEED TO SEE SOMETHING, MAN.
NEED TO SEE SOMETHING.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.373
GO AHEAD.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.075
<i>GO FOR IT.</i>

16:18.077 --> 16:20.277
Keith: HOPEFULLY, WE CAN GET
THE GEAR SET ON ENOUGH

16:20.279 --> 16:23.447
TO WHERE WE'LL PUT SOMETHING
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TANKS

16:23.449 --> 16:26.384
SO MONTE CAN START
WITH A DECENT TRIP NEXT TRIP.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.719
Narrator: WITH THE SEASON
OFF TO A SLOW START,

16:28.721 --> 16:30.054
KEITH'S PLAN IS TO SET UP

16:30.056 --> 16:32.656
HIS BROTHER
ON MORE FERTILE GROUNDS.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.063
20, 22, 24 THERE.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.333
Keith:
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN LEAVE
AND LEAVE THE BOAT SCRATCHING.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.771
YOU LEAVE THE BOAT IN BETTER
SHAPE THAN YOU FOUND IT.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.105
KIND OF HOPING TO SEE SOMETHING

16:48.107 --> 16:52.343
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.678
HOPEFULLY, THIS POT WILL
BLOW UP ON US HERE.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.847
AND WE CAN JUST
GET TO GRINDING AWAY.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.650
GOD KNOWS WE NEED
TO SEE SOMETHING.

16:59.652 --> 17:03.220
AS FOR THE TEAM, WELL,
WHEN MONTE GOES OFF DECK,

17:03.222 --> 17:04.688
THAT'S A BIG HIT.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.323
THAT'S A HUGE HIT, YOU KNOW?

17:06.325 --> 17:08.826
NEXT TRIP, WE'RE GONNA BE
GOING WITH A FOUR-MAN SHIFT.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.228
AND THAT MEANS THE GUY
IS GONNA BE REALLY UNDER

17:11.230 --> 17:14.031
A LOT OF PRESSURE
UP THERE IN THE BAIT STATION.

17:14.032 --> 17:18.202
I DON'T THINK JJ OR MIKE
CAN HANDLE IT BY THEMSELVES.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.404
Narrator: SO FAR THIS SEASON...

17:20.406 --> 17:21.972
WHERE'S THE BAIT?

17:21.973 --> 17:25.342
TWO BAIT GUYS CAN'T PUT BAIT
SETUPS IN TWO POTS IN A ROW.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.844
UN-[BLEEP]-BELIEVABLE.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.880
...THE BAIT STATION HAS BEEN
THE WEAK LINK ON DECK...

17:29.882 --> 17:31.849
I THINK NEITHER OF YOU GUYS
REALLY HAVE ANY IDEA

17:31.851 --> 17:33.083
WHO'S IN CHARGE.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.985
HERE'S THE DEAL,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.188
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF THE [BLEEP] STATION, OKAY?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.889
THAT MEANS,
HE'S [BLEEP] YOUR BOSS.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.758
Narrator:
...FORCING KEITH TO PUT SOME

17:40.760 --> 17:44.962
ADDED PRESSURE
ON GREENHORN "JJ" JAMES.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.768
WE'D LIKE TO PRESENT YOU WITH
THE BERING SEA BAIT BOSS BADGE.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.102
YOU BETTER WEAR IT PROUD.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.539
-YEAH.
-LOUD AND PROUD, BUDDY.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.907
Keith:
MY GUESS IS, AT THIS POINT,

17:56.909 --> 17:59.643
JJ'S LIFE IS GONNA
BECOME A LIVING HELL

17:59.645 --> 18:01.178
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MY CREW

18:01.180 --> 18:04.181
IS GONNA LET HIM SLACK
IN THE BAIT STATION ANY LONGER.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.784
AND THAT GOES
FOR "PAINT CHIPS" TOO.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.352
SO I WOULD THINK RIGHT NOW,
AT THIS POINT,

18:08.354 --> 18:10.921
THOSE GUYS ARE GONNA KEEP AN EYE
ON THAT BAIT STATION

18:10.923 --> 18:14.492
TO MAKE SURE THOSE GUYS
ARE DOING THEIR JOB PROPERLY.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.093
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE BAD
STREAK'S GONNA END,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.329
BUT I'VE GOT TO
TURN IT AROUND HERE.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.847
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE
MY BROTHER HIGH AND DRY.

18:22.869 --> 18:28.005
Narrator: STILL 170 MILES FROM
LAND, ON THE <i> NORTHWESTERN...</i>

18:28.007 --> 18:30.975
RIGHT NOW, EDGAR IS TRYING
TO GET THAT PANEL CLEANED UP

18:30.977 --> 18:35.713
SO THAT WE CAN UTILIZE
OUR FOUR-CYLINDER ENGINE

18:35.715 --> 18:40.384
AND ISOLATE A COUPLE
OF THOSE BREAKERS

18:40.386 --> 18:44.522
SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST
GET POWER TO OUR CRAB PUMPS.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.658
THAT'S OUR PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.226
Narrator:
AFTER A FIRE IN THE ENGINE ROOM

18:49.228 --> 18:51.262
TOOK OUT THE BOAT'S
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.472
...ENGINEER EDGAR HANSEN

19:01.474 --> 19:04.241
HAS BEEN WORKING 24/7
TO RESTORE POWER.

19:09.849 --> 19:14.652
Sig:
I'M NOT TOUCHING NONE OF THIS
UNTIL HE GIVES ME THE GO-AHEAD.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.587
WE'RE HAND STEERING.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.328
OH, THAT'S A BIG-ASS TURN.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.203
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

19:32.205 --> 19:35.306
I'M GONNA RUN DOWN REAL QUICK,
AND I'LL BE BACK, OKAY?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.608
-YEAH.
-YOU GOT TO TAKE THE HATCH OFF.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.882
OPEN THAT HATCH.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.184
FRONT TANK IS FULL.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.287
WHILE WE WERE DRIFTING, IT WAS
ALREADY DOWN A FOOT OR TWO.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.162
THAT'S COME UP.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.165
THAT TANK IS HALF FULL.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.268
THE WATER IS COMING
IN FROM HERE.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.071
THERE'S AN OPENING HERE.
AND IT'S COMING IN.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.706
AND IT'S FILLING.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.007
WE PUT A PLATE HERE.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.976
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
IT'S HAPPENING.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.312
SO IT'S SLOWLY FILLING UP.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.548
IT'S ABOUT
TWO TO THREE FEET DOWN.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.153
THIS IS WHERE IT'S COMING IN
AND GOING OUT, RIGHT HERE.

20:22.155 --> 20:24.922
THIS IS THE BAD ONE. AFT.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.891
Narrator:
WITHOUT POWER TO RUN THE PUMPS,

20:26.893 --> 20:31.028
THE WATER LEVEL IN THE CRAB
TANKS CAN'T BE REGULATED.

20:31.030 --> 20:35.266
SHIFTING WATER CAUSES
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A SLACK TANK.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.735
THIS IMBALANCE CAN TIP
THE VESSEL TOO FAR

20:37.737 --> 20:41.505
TO ONE SIDE, CAPSIZING IT.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.941
Edgar: THIS BAD SITUATION
WENT TO WORSE.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.943
WE HAVE TWO SLACK TANKS.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.946
SLACK TANKS IS ONE OF YOUR
WORST THINGS TO HAVE,

20:48.948 --> 20:51.248
SLACK TANKS AND FIRES.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.519
AND RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE GOT BOTH OF THEM.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.655
Narrator: WITH THE BOAT
BECOMING LESS STABLE,

20:57.657 --> 20:59.990
EDGAR IS IN A RACE AGAINST TIME.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.617
TO BRING THE PUMPS BACK ONLINE,

21:26.619 --> 21:30.020
EDGAR MUST NEGOTIATE
A RAT'S NEST OF BURNT WIRES

21:30.022 --> 21:31.555
AND BAD CONNECTIONS.

21:31.557 --> 21:34.492

22:27.246 --> 22:29.113

22:32.318 --> 22:34.852
-WHOO!
-AND WE HAVE A PUMP.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.655
IF WE CAN JUST GET THE --
-TRY TURNING ON THE STEERING.

22:37.657 --> 22:40.824
OKAY, REALLY?

22:40.826 --> 22:42.760
OKAY, DON'T TOUCH, MANDY.
GET HER --

22:42.762 --> 22:44.495
GET HER --
GET HER STRAIGHTENED OUT.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.397
NORM,
CAN YOU TURN ON THAT GPS

22:46.399 --> 22:48.899
THAT RUNS THIS
AUTOPILOT, PLEASE?

22:48.901 --> 22:52.369
GET HER GOING,
AND KEEP HER ON 105.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.538
YEAH, THIS ONE.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.674
WHOO!

22:58.578 --> 23:02.746
SO, I NOW HAVE --
OKAY, HERE WE GO!

23:02.748 --> 23:04.848
OKAY.
MANDY, DON'T TOUCH.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.158
OH, YEAH!

23:14.160 --> 23:17.561
YEAH! I GOT IT.
I GOT STEERING.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.898
I GOT MANUAL.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.468
OKAY, MANDY,
YOU'RE ON WATCH.

23:24.470 --> 23:28.706
GET IN HERE! HEY!

23:28.708 --> 23:32.409
HERE, A LITTLE EASIER.
KEEP THIS AT 104.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.612
SIT RIGHT THERE. STEER.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.852
RIGHT THERE.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.188
RUDDER, THIS.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.624
AWESOME!

23:51.397 --> 23:53.464
EDGAR SURPRISES ME EVERY DAY.

23:53.466 --> 23:55.766
YOU KNOW, HE NEVER WENT
TO SCHOOL, NO NOTHING.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.568
BUT MOST OF THE FISHERMAN
THAT I KNOW,

23:57.570 --> 23:58.869
THEY NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.938
THEY'VE LEARNED
EVERYTHING THEY DO KNOW

24:00.940 --> 24:05.242
FROM EXPERIENCE,
FROM FAILURE ALONE.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.012
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES TIME
TO WORK THINGS BACK UP.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.713
AND THAT'S HOW THEY LEARN,
BY PULLING THINGS APART

24:09.715 --> 24:13.751
AND PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER AND
COMING INTO THESE SITUATIONS.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.886
AND THAT PUMP, YOU'RE JUST
ON THAT AFT PUMP?

24:15.888 --> 24:18.155
I'VE GOT
ALL THREE PUMPS GOING.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.357
OH, NO [BLEEP]
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.026
I'M GOING TO DUTCH.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.495
OKAY, GOOD JOB.
-THANKS.

AW, COME ON.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.883
...ON THE 107-FOOT <i> SAGA...</i>

24:48.854 --> 24:50.821
A BUNCH OF [BLEEP] GARBAGE.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.160

24:56.162 --> 24:58.262
NOT THE CRAB I'M LOOKING FOR.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.230
Narrator:
FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

25:00.232 --> 25:05.369
CAPTAIN JAKE ANDERSON
HAS HAD A TOUGH GO OF IT.

25:05.371 --> 25:09.239
Jake: THE SHALLOWER I GO, I'M
JUST SEEING A LOT OF SMALL CRAB.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.774
THEY'RE REALLY DIRTY.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.943
AND THE PLANT'S
NOT GONNA LIKE THAT.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.611
THE BUYERS AREN'T
GONNA LIKE THAT.

25:14.613 --> 25:18.816
Narrator:
AND THIS STRING IS NO DIFFERENT.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.785
Jake: WE'LL GRIND ON THIS
UNTIL WE RUN OUT OF CRAB.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.654
THAT'S MY STRATEGY.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.589

THE SKIPPER HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO STAY PUT.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.298
THIS IS GARBAGE,
GARBAGE, GARBAGE.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.734
WE'RE IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.543
WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK
AHEAD OF US, SO...

25:50.416 --> 25:54.284
CAN'T HELP BUT TO FEEL
A LITTLE BIT DEFEATED.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.720
BUT IT'S ONLY ONE STRING.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.222
I'M GONNA FEEL
A LOT BETTER, THOUGH,

25:58.224 --> 26:00.391
WHEN I DO FIND GOOD CRAB.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.626
I WILL. IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF WHEN.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.934

OH, [BLEEP]

KIDDING ME, DUDE?

26:18.511 --> 26:20.210
DON'T TELL ME
THE HYDRAULICS STOPPED.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.478
YEAH.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.348
THE PICKING WINCH
JUST STOPPED WORKING.

Narrator: THE HYDRO SHUT DOWN,

26:26.118 --> 26:29.653
LEAVING THE 800-POUND POT
SWINGING DANGEROUSLY.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.156

<i>HOLD ON TO IT. HOLD ON.</i>

26:32.158 --> 26:33.190

<i>HEY, GUYS, WATCH OUT.</i>

26:34.560 --> 26:35.959
GOSH DAMN IT.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.628

26:37.630 --> 26:40.764
KEEP HOLDING ON TO IT, FELLAS.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.034
WHAT THE [BLEEP]
I CAN'T [BLEEP] BELIEVE IT.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.042

WE'VE GOT LOTS OF PRESSURE.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.310
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.646
IT'S ALMOST LIKE ONE
OF THE VALVES IS OPEN,

26:55.648 --> 26:57.815
AND IT'S BYPASSING
OR SOME DAMN THING.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.620

ST. PAUL CLOSES IN 11 DAYS.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.377
I STILL HAVE CRAB
THAT HAS TO GO THERE.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.512
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO

27:28.514 --> 27:32.049
IF I DON'T HAVE MY CRAB

29:05.444 --> 29:07.243

29:07.245 --> 29:11.214
THE PICK'S STUCK.

29:11.216 --> 29:13.450
MY HEART
IS [BLEEP] POUNDING.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.219

IN THE AIR

29:18.790 --> 29:21.858

AND THE [BLEEP] THING
SWUNG WAY OUT.

29:38.844 --> 29:42.078
EVERYBODY RAN.
AND THEN I DROPPED THE BOOM.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.816
[BLEEP] HYDRAULICS
ARE AN ISSUE.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.953
THEY'RE [BLEEP] PISSED.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.026
IT'S THAT KIND OF [BLEEP]

29:56.028 --> 29:58.628
THAT MAKES ME JUST WANT
TO GO [BLEEP] HOME.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.597
I DON'T WANT TO PUT
ANYBODY IN DANGER.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.399
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN DANGER.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.809
Narrator: UNWILLING TO RISK
A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT,

30:12.811 --> 30:14.844
JAKE LEAVES HIS GEAR
IN THE WATER

30:14.846 --> 30:16.680
AND HEADS FOR PORT.

30:16.682 --> 30:21.384
I CAME OUT HERE TO MAKE MONEY,
NOT TO [BLEEP] GET HURT.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.820
WHAT A GOOD MORNING.

30:26.725 --> 30:29.359

30:32.964 --> 30:36.166
...ON THE <i> CAPE CAUTION...</i>

30:36.168 --> 30:38.702
WE ARE ON THE EDGE.
THESE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL CRAB.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.503
I'M GETTING GREAT NUMBERS.

SO, WHAT ARE MY PLANS FOR ZACK?

30:44.109 --> 30:47.077
Narrator:
...DIALED IN ON THE CRAB,
CAPTAIN "WILD" BILL WICHROWSKI

30:47.079 --> 30:49.045
HAS BEEN
GIVING HAULING LESSONS.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.647
SO FAR,
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

30:50.649 --> 30:55.218
IN ZACK'S MOTIVATION
TO LEARN HOW TO FISH.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.821
PART OF ME WONDERS
IF HE EVEN WANTS THE JOB.

30:57.823 --> 31:01.024
THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT IS RIGHT HERE

31:01.026 --> 31:02.892
FOR THE ASKING FOR ZACK.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.730
AND THERE'S SO MUCH THAT HE,
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

31:06.732 --> 31:09.466
DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO
STEP UP AND ASK, YOU KNOW,

31:09.468 --> 31:13.937
AND GRASP OR GRAB OR GO AFTER.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.206
I'M REALLY PERPLEXED
ABOUT THE WHOLE DEAL.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.674
BUT, YEAH, I WANT
TO GET HIM UP HERE.

31:17.676 --> 31:22.512
AGAIN, WE'RE NOW SIXTH-TENTHS
OF A MILE FROM THE FIRST POT.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.315
Narrator: AFTER GIVING DECK BOSS
NICK McGLASHAN HIS SHOT,

31:25.317 --> 31:29.753
IT'S TIME FOR THE CAPTAIN'S SON,
ZACK, TO TAKE THE WHEEL.

31:29.755 --> 31:30.820
Bill:
WHAT I'M THINKING IS WE'VE GOT,

31:30.822 --> 31:32.422
LIKE, THREE STRINGS
LEFT OVER HERE.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.792
WE'LL RUN THOSE. EVERYTHING
SHOULD HAVE SOAK ON IT.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.695
I THINK, ZACK,
YOU CAN RUN THIS NEXT STRING.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.230
OKAY.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.600
SO YOU MIGHT HEAD UP THERE
AND SEE WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.368
GET IT FIGURED OUT.
LET THE GUYS KNOW

31:45.370 --> 31:47.337
WHEN THEY GOT TO
BE OUT THERE AND...

31:47.339 --> 31:50.039
OKAY.

31:55.313 --> 31:58.481
Bill: IN THE BEGINNING,
YOU SHOULD GO FOR PERFECTION.

31:58.483 --> 32:00.049
GO FOR, LIKE, THE SMOOTHEST,

32:00.051 --> 32:01.584
MOST EXACT MOTION YOU CAN.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.486
YOU KNOW?
LOOK AT IT AS, LIKE,

32:03.488 --> 32:05.221
YOUR OWN COMPETITION,
EVERY STRING.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.422
OKAY.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.757
SO YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
GONNA BE RUNNING WEST.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.260
THIS SHOULD BE
A PRETTY EASY STRING TO RUN

32:10.262 --> 32:12.896
OTHER THAN IT'S IN THE DARK.
SO HAVE SOME FUN.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.265
BUT THINK ABOUT IT. YOU WANT
TO BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE, SO.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.700
OKAY.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.610
COMING UP.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.711
GIVE THEM HELL.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.447
THANKS, DAD.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.850
DON'T MAKE MY SHOTS TOO TOUGH.
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK BAD.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.690
OH, CAPTAIN'S
ON DECK AGAIN.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.794
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR ME

32:44.796 --> 32:46.896
IS TRYING TO FIND
THESE BAGS AT NIGHT.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.198
THE FEW TIMES
THAT I HAVE RUN GEAR,

32:48.200 --> 32:52.135
IT'S BEEN DURING THE DAYTIME.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.138
SO NIGHTTIME IS
THE WHOLE NOTHER GAME.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.682
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
MAKING MY DAD PROUD.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.584
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT
DOING A GOOD JOB,

33:07.586 --> 33:08.651
KEEPING THE GUYS SAFE.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.588
YOU KNOW, I RAN
A BOAT THIS SUMMER.

33:11.590 --> 33:15.091
AND EVEN IF HE DOESN'T
EVER PAT ME ON THE BACK FOR IT,

33:15.093 --> 33:17.460
HE'LL PROBABLY SAY
THAT I DID A GOOD JOB.

33:17.462 --> 33:18.962
I KNOW I DID A GOOD JOB.

33:18.964 --> 33:22.332
THE NEXT STEP FOR ME IS JUST,
YOU KNOW, RUNNING CRAB BOATS.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.268
¶¶

33:45.523 --> 33:47.891
MY DAD DECIDES TO BUY A NEW BOAT
AND SOMETHING,

33:47.893 --> 33:50.193
I HOPE THAT I'M THAT
OPTION TO GO WITH.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.195
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
BEING AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.964
I STILL -- I WANT IT.
I JUST...

33:54.966 --> 33:58.668
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS BE
THE FIRST GUY THROUGH THE DOOR.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.204
TWO MORE
IN THE WATER HERE.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.640
NOW I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

34:06.444 --> 34:07.777
LAST ONE COMING UP, GUYS.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.213
GOOD JOB. THANK YOU.

34:14.619 --> 34:17.387
HEY, YOU DID
A FANTASTIC JOB, ZACK.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.926
AND THE MOMENT OF TRUTH --

34:22.928 --> 34:24.928
GET THE REPORT FROM THE BOSS.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.201
HOW'D YOU DO?

34:32.203 --> 34:34.337
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
THAT QUESTION.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.505
SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS
POTS THERE ALL THE TIME.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.908
SO THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.514
Zack: WHAT DO YOU THINK
I HAVE TO DO MORE OF

34:45.516 --> 34:47.516
TO BE UP HERE MORE?

34:47.518 --> 34:51.254
OBVIOUSLY,
YOUR STAMP OF APPROVAL...

34:51.255 --> 34:52.889
I'LL TELL YOU THIS
SHORT AND SWEET.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.223
I REALLY WOULD
LIKE YOU TO COME UP

34:54.225 --> 34:56.592
AND TALK ABOUT HOW
AND WHY MORE.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.895
FOR ME
TO BE INVOLVED IN A BOAT,

34:58.897 --> 35:01.531
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
A LOT MORE EFFORT ON THIS.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.766
YOU HAVE YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR
WITH THE 10 RIG.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.535
I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO THINK

35:05.537 --> 35:07.003
THAT ANYBODY'S
EVER JUST GONNA SAY,

35:07.005 --> 35:08.338
"HERE, ZACK.
GO CRABBING."

35:10.475 --> 35:11.874
I'M JUST TELLING YOU,
ZACK,

35:11.876 --> 35:13.209
IF YOU WANT
THE SEAL OF APPROVAL,

35:13.211 --> 35:15.244
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, YOU GOT TO
PUT MORE EFFORT INTO IT.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.612
COME TALK TO ME.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.848
I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO EXPLAIN
SOME OF THIS TO YOU.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.517
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON
I'M STILL DOING THIS

35:21.519 --> 35:23.686
IS SO
YOU CAN MAKE THE STEP.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.154
AND I KNOW
I'M [BLEEP] SOMETIMES

35:25.156 --> 35:27.623

"YOU DID A GOOD JOB."

35:27.625 --> 35:29.225
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

35:29.227 --> 35:31.027
IT'S MY GOAL TO DO
THE BEST JOB I CAN.

35:31.029 --> 35:34.564
AND I'D LOVE TO TEACH YOU
MORE ABOUT WHAT I DO.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.933

THAT I'D LEAVE AFTER
I PUT IN TWO GOOD TRIPS.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.847
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
TRUST MONTE TO CATCH CRAB,

WHOO!

37:58.511 --> 38:01.378
OH, MAN, DON'T LOOK GOOD.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.214
THE DOOR'S NOT COVERED.
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE AFTER.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.756
14.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.024
NEED A LITTLE MORE
THAN THAT, GUYS.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.460
NEED A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.

38:19.198 --> 38:21.298
WE GOT 18.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.833
[BLEEP]

38:25.771 --> 38:27.104
COME ON, GUYS,
WE NEED SOME CRAB HERE.

38:27.106 --> 38:29.540
[BLEEP] BUMMER.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.779
24. 2-4.

38:38.717 --> 38:43.487
YOU KNOW IT'S BAD
WHEN A 24 COUNT SHOWS UP

38:43.489 --> 38:44.955
AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY
NOT TOO BUMMED OUT

38:44.957 --> 38:48.492
BECAUSE THE TWO PREVIOUS COUNTS
WERE SINGLE DIGITS OR TEENS.

39:00.706 --> 39:04.942
WHERE DID HE JUST GO
WITH THOSE TWO BAIT JUGS?

39:04.944 --> 39:07.844
<i>WHY DID YOU</i>
<i>TAKE THOSE UP THERE?</i>

39:07.846 --> 39:09.646
JUST FROM HERE,
I CAN LOOK UP THERE AND SEE

39:09.648 --> 39:10.981
THAT THERE'S NO
BAIT JUGS HANGING.

39:10.983 --> 39:13.150
SO THERE'S NO BAIT
HANGING UP THERE.

39:13.152 --> 39:14.985
Narrator: ADDING TO
THE SKIPPER'S FRUSTRATION...

39:14.987 --> 39:17.020
THAT DON'T [BLEEP] FLY,
ALL RIGHT?

39:17.022 --> 39:21.625
Narrator:
...THE BAIT STATION CAN'T SEEM
TO GET OUT OF ITS OWN WAY.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.293
CAPTAIN'S GOING OFF RIGHT NOW.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.495
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
CATCHING A LOT OF CRAB.

39:29.735 --> 39:33.537
[BLEEP]

39:33.539 --> 39:35.072
Mike: RIGHT NOW
CAPTAIN'S GETTING MAD

39:35.074 --> 39:38.475
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF [BLEEP] BAGS OUT THERE.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.612
WE'RE NOT DOING IT
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DONE.

39:41.614 --> 39:44.514
Keith:
LITTLE THINGS, LITTLE THINGS
THAT ADD UP TO BIG THINGS.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.750
I CAN'T BE SPENDING
ENERGY AND TIME

39:46.752 --> 39:49.086
AND THOUGHT ON HOW THESE GUYS
ARE BAITING THESE POTS

39:49.088 --> 39:50.654
OR WHETHER THEY'RE
DOING THEIR JOB.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.289
THEY'VE GOT TO GET IT DONE.

39:52.291 --> 39:54.625
OH, KEITH IS TAKING IT JUST
LIKE YOU'D EXPECT HIM TO,

39:54.627 --> 39:56.627
NOT HAPPY ONE BIT.

39:56.629 --> 39:59.029
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.467
TRIP FROM HELL IS ALMOST OVER.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.868
WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.304
I'VE GOT TWO MORE POTS TO HAUL.

40:07.306 --> 40:09.039
<i>RIGHT THERE.</i>

40:09.041 --> 40:10.674
ONE MORE AFTER THAT ONE.

40:10.676 --> 40:14.878
<i>-52.</i>
-52.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.814
EVERYTHING HAS GONE
TO HELL ON US HERE.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.583
YOU KNOW, I TOLD MONTE
BEFORE THE SEASON

40:19.585 --> 40:21.551
I'D LEAVE AFTER I PUT IN
TWO GOOD TRIPS.

40:21.553 --> 40:27.858
WELL, I HAVEN'T PUT IN
TWO GOOD TRIPS.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.527
IT'S ALL ON MY BROTHER'S
SHOULDERS RIGHT NOW.

40:33.065 --> 40:35.832
HEADING BACK TO TOWN
WITH MY TAIL BETWEEN MY LEGS.

40:40.406 --> 40:42.773
Narrator: 165 MILES SOUTH...

40:45.744 --> 40:48.211
WELL, WE'RE IN DUTCH HARBOR.
WE'RE JUST TYING UP.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.814
Narrator: ...THE <i> NORTHWESTERN</i>
LIMPS INTO TOWN.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.118
Sig: BOAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.953
THERE WAS A FIRE.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.556
AND I DON'T KNOW
THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.

40:59.558 --> 41:02.192
Narrator: AFTER BEING FORCED OFF
THE FISHING GROUNDS,

41:02.194 --> 41:05.762
THE FATE OF CAPTAIN SIG HANSEN'S
SEASON IS UNCERTAIN.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.198
WE MAY HAVE TO FLY PARTS IN.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.233
AND UNTIL THEY
ASSESS THE SITUATION,

41:10.235 --> 41:11.668
WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW.

41:11.670 --> 41:15.405
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS,
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

41:15.407 --> 41:18.308
CLOCK'S TICKING FOR US.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.712
Edgar: OVER 30 HOURS IN,
JUST LOST OVER A DAY AND A HALF.

41:21.714 --> 41:24.081
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS
IS GONNA TAKE TO FIX?

41:24.083 --> 41:26.349
DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THIS PLACE
UNTIL WE WERE FULL.

41:29.021 --> 41:31.655
NOW WE'RE EMPTY AND BROKEN.

41:35.561 --> 41:39.329
AS FAR AS A BAD SITUATION, WE'RE
IN THE BEST SPOT WE CAN BE.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.498
MAIN THING IS EVERYBODY'S OKAY.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.569
I JUST REALLY AM BUMMED OUT
ABOUT THE FISHING.

41:45.571 --> 41:47.571
JUST MOVED THE GEAR --
JUST --

41:47.573 --> 41:49.673
JUST --

41:49.675 --> 41:52.609
I JUST CAN'T SWALLOW IT.

41:52.611 --> 41:55.078
IT'S TOUGH.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.713
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE THRILL OF THE HUNT.

41:56.715 --> 41:59.649
AND THEN IT'S OVER
BEFORE IT STARTED.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.791
AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT.

42:08.305 --> 42:14.600
