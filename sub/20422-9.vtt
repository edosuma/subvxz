Let's finish it up quick and eat some chicken.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.250
It won't be quick.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.880
But if we do it like we planned, 
it should work out.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.760
So what are our odds, honestly, Shiroe?

00:34.090 --> 00:36.010
Fifty-fifty.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.490
We're within twenty meters.

Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

03:16.390 --> 03:18.800
I've seen that skill before, but...

03:19.100 --> 03:21.390
It's far more powerful than it was in Heilos.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.930
Time from the motion to activation is shorter, too.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.930

03:28.760 --> 03:30.260
No, the motion is different.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.450
It's a different skill!

03:33.240 --> 03:35.240
Each of his hits is so strong.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.320
Stand in the wrong spot, 
and you'll be killed instantly.

03:37.830 --> 03:40.850

03:48.470 --> 03:49.910

you're healed, go back at him!

03:59.940 --> 04:01.130
I'm doing it!

04:01.540 --> 04:04.010
After he uses his skill, he's wide open.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.140
That's our chance to attack!

04:07.620 --> 04:09.950
That's the second time, 
and already, no more insta-kills.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.780
He's taken enough damage 
that he's changing modes?

06:24.250 --> 06:27.460
Before, you had to do something 
in the dungeon to trigger it,

06:27.460 --> 06:29.800

08:19.380 --> 08:23.450
as the number of people that attacked 
Luseat in Black Knight Mode.

08:23.790 --> 08:24.760
I see.

08:24.760 --> 08:25.870
Which means...

08:25.870 --> 08:30.880
If we reduce our numbers by having 
only the high damagers attack,

08:30.880 --> 08:32.780
and have everyone else focus on buffs,

08:36.210 --> 08:40.540

14:41.320 --> 14:43.380
When you die, you learn a lot...

14:44.140 --> 14:47.070
That you suck, that you're petty, that you're lame.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.190
If you die a hundred times, 
you learn that a hundred times.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.280
It gets too painful to continue.

14:54.940 --> 14:55.910
<i>I see.</i>

14:56.390 --> 14:58.500
<i>So this is what it is to die.</i>

15:00.320 --> 15:02.820
<i>It means feeling like you want to die.</i>

15:04.590 --> 15:07.410
<i>I've felt that many times.</i>

15:08.210 --> 15:10.590
<i>The night I threw away the notebook 
that was so dear to me,</i>

15:11.320 --> 15:14.100
<i>the night I forced myself to smile and say goodbye,</i>

15:14.850 --> 15:16.990
<i>the night I bid goodbye to the library...</i>

15:17.930 --> 15:20.590
<i>I've felt it again and again.</i>

15:21.890 --> 15:25.320
<i>Why did Demikas knock me away?</i>

15:26.770 --> 15:30.680
<i>Why did William accept my request?</i>

15:31.670 --> 15:35.310
<i>Why did Naotsugu follow me?</i>

15:37.940 --> 15:42.260
<i>I'm hiding something from the people I care about,</i>

15:42.590 --> 15:44.340
<i>the people who believe in me.</i>

15:45.900 --> 15:49.800
There's a possibility that there are 
Minami spies in Akihabara.

15:50.330 --> 15:54.310
You don't know where information might leak.

15:54.310 --> 15:55.060
Exactly.

15:56.870 --> 15:59.930
<i>Minami isn't what I'm really worried about.</i>

16:01.310 --> 16:02.980
<i>In this world,</i>

16:02.980 --> 16:06.690
<i>there is something besides adventurers 
and People of the Land.</i>

16:08.070 --> 16:12.270
<i>The third party that brought us here.</i>

16:14.400 --> 16:19.930
<i>I've used my Round Table connections 
to try to find out who it might be.</i>

16:21.580 --> 16:24.790
<i>I asked Roderic to investigate the flavor text.</i>

16:25.390 --> 16:27.960
<i>I asked Soujirou to see if the monsters were changing.</i>

16:28.470 --> 16:31.570
<i>I asked Michitaka about southern plants.</i>

16:32.580 --> 16:36.850
<i>I asked Karashin to gather and 
organize Eastal folk literature.</i>

16:38.200 --> 16:42.250
<i>Of course, it was without telling 
them what I was really after.</i>

16:46.990 --> 16:53.600
<i>Everything I managed to get together gave 
the impression that there was no third party.</i>

16:54.250 --> 16:55.310
<i>However...</i>

16:56.980 --> 16:59.290
<i>Proof of it appeared at the perfect time.</i>

16:59.290 --> 17:02.370
<i>It seemed set up to make me believe it.</i>

17:07.020 --> 17:08.720
That's an excuse again.

17:09.250 --> 17:12.370
I thought I was doing it to avoid worrying them,

17:12.370 --> 17:14.760
but I'm still causing trouble for them.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.800
Just like how they waited for me back then.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.180
I'm sure everyone else...

17:21.320 --> 17:23.560
I was only pushing them all away.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.230
I should have been more open with them.

17:27.230 --> 17:28.640
And Kinjou, too.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.000
I doubted him and didn't tell him enough.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.540
I should have told him what I was really after.

17:47.390 --> 17:48.250
Yes.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.720
That's right.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.310
I have to go, don't I?

17:58.190 --> 18:02.090
I have to get up from this bench, 
and return to everyone.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.000
The Earth?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.410
Then this is...

18:20.200 --> 18:21.220
The Moon?

18:24.920 --> 18:25.960
<i>Latin?</i>

18:26.390 --> 18:28.920
<i>It means "Sea of Tranquility," I think.</i>

18:29.870 --> 18:31.400
<i>This really is the Moon.</i>

18:32.300 --> 18:33.670
<i>But why?</i>

18:34.850 --> 18:37.210
<i>Might it be the test server?</i>

18:38.140 --> 18:43.380
Elder Tale, <i>the game, is divided 
among thirteen servers.</i>

18:44.630 --> 18:49.310
<i>The test server is a fourteenth, unofficial server.</i>

18:50.480 --> 18:55.190
I'd heard rumors that it was on the 
Moon, but I can't believe it's really...

19:49.020 --> 19:51.820
I didn't think it would be so quiet here.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.250
Yeah.

19:59.150 --> 20:01.830
Something disappeared...

20:05.660 --> 20:07.800
Did you also feel it, my lord?

20:15.590 --> 20:16.630
Akatsuki...

20:33.140 --> 20:34.330
Amazing, isn't it?

20:35.130 --> 20:38.060
It isn't snow, is it?

20:38.600 --> 20:39.380
No.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.350
Everyone's thoughts...

20:41.810 --> 20:43.880
The memory fragments they offered up,

20:44.430 --> 20:46.390
so they could rise up once more.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.330
You were defeated, Akatsuki?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.170
I see.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.000
So was I.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.630
I died.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.270
You, too, my lord?

20:59.790 --> 21:00.690
Yeah.

21:02.730 --> 21:06.790
It's been a heck of a Christmas Eve, my lord.

21:16.660 --> 21:17.990
I failed.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.420
I was naïve.

21:20.890 --> 21:22.530
I couldn't trust them enough.

21:22.530 --> 21:24.510
I don't understand.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.180
It isn't that I'm upset because I couldn't win.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.830
You didn't do the best you could.

21:31.410 --> 21:33.690
You didn't do what you needed to do.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.190
Akatsuki, you may have fallen.

21:40.740 --> 21:43.700
But you haven't lost yet, have you?

21:45.130 --> 21:46.090
It's okay.

21:46.540 --> 21:48.020
I know.

21:48.670 --> 21:51.840
I know you're working hard.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.600
<i>So I will, too.</i>

21:58.400 --> 21:59.690
It's strange.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.840
I didn't think I'd see you here.

22:03.290 --> 22:04.630
Yeah, my lord.

22:04.630 --> 22:05.470
It is strange.

22:07.950 --> 22:11.090
I'm going to try again.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.720
I will, too, I guess.

22:14.260 --> 22:15.730
Everyone taught me.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.180
My lord...

22:31.300 --> 22:34.320
<i>And so, I revived.</i>

24:05.790 --> 24:07.210
Feelings exposed.

24:07.210 --> 24:08.320
What else is there?

24:08.320 --> 24:09.510
What else can I do?

24:09.510 --> 24:10.570
Nothing.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.190
No matter what anyone else says,

24:12.190 --> 24:13.540
no matter what they think,

24:13.540 --> 24:14.680
I'll keep moving forward.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.810
That's my decision.

24:16.390 --> 24:18.030
There's no way back.

24:18.030 --> 24:19.650
Again and again...

24:20.070 --> 24:22.530
Until I plant that flag on this land.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.030
Next time: Guild Master.

24:23.150 --> 24:29.990
<b>Guild Master</b>

24:25.750 --> 24:27.690
Rise up once more.
