00:01.262 --> 00:02.567
Previously onLucifer...

00:02.611 --> 00:04.178
We need to figure out
who kidnapped me.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.962
I'm fairly certain that
my Father's behind it.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.355
AMENADIEL: Lucifer,
I'm not angry with you,

00:07.398 --> 00:08.704
that you somehow
got your wings back,

00:08.747 --> 00:10.749
or even that
you cut them off again.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.534
I was tested once,
and I failed.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.796
I'm not gonna fail again.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.016
I suppose this won't bother you.

00:16.842 --> 00:17.800
But you cut them off.

00:17.843 --> 00:18.975
The pesky things seem to be

00:19.019 --> 00:20.846
a bit more tenacious
this time around.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.196
I'm Lieutenant Marcus Pierce.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.806
DAN: Heard a lot about
you, Lieutenant,

00:23.849 --> 00:25.286
and I'm really excited
to work with you.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.114
Aren't you that corrupt
cop that got off easy?

00:27.157 --> 00:28.245
Excuse me?

00:28.289 --> 00:29.507
People come to me
to ask for favors,

00:29.551 --> 00:31.205
and more often than not,
I'm happy to oblige.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.380
What do you get?

00:32.423 --> 00:34.730
Simply to be repaid
at a later date.

00:34.773 --> 00:37.515
A devilish IOU, if you will.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.735
LUCIFER:
Who's the Sinnerman?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.215
That's who hired me
to kidnap you.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.652
He's a scary dude.
Huge crime boss.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.827
And where do I find him?

00:44.870 --> 00:48.048
SAM:
You don't. He finds you.

Oh, gosh.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.523
Uh, my apologies.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.481
And for the record,
I don't usually suffer

01:30.525 --> 01:33.049
from premature unfurling.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.485
[grunts, chuckles]

01:34.529 --> 01:37.140
Right.
Now, where were we?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.403
No, keep them out.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.493
I'm totally into cosplay.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.670
I could dress up as a devil
and make it really sexy.

01:45.714 --> 01:50.240
I have no desire
to have sex with myself.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.634
Not right now, at least.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.070
Where are you going?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.290
To do some grooming.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.380
[sighs]

01:59.423 --> 02:00.903
I'd recommend you leave. Now.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.211
I'm about to engage
in a rather gruesome form

02:04.254 --> 02:05.560
of manscaping.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.127
LINDA:
You cut them off, didn't you?

02:07.170 --> 02:09.259
I did, yes.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.435
But then they grew back,
so I cut them off again.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.089
It's like whack-a-mole
back there.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.569
[chuckles]

02:14.612 --> 02:16.092
I'm worried about you.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.487
What you're describing
is self-mutilation.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.229
Doctor, someone is
forcing those wings on me.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.274
They took away my devil face.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.711
And I won't stand for someone
making me something I'm not.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.889
Are you any closer to
finding out who did this?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.675
Yes. Well, a little.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.199
He calls himself
"The Sinnerman."

02:36.243 --> 02:37.722
From what I can gather,

02:37.766 --> 02:40.334
he's a criminal mastermind
who just moved his operation

02:40.377 --> 02:42.901
to Los Angeles, but no one
seems to have ever met him,

02:42.945 --> 02:45.600
which makes punching him in the
face frustratingly difficult.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.950
Well, maybe... [groans]

02:47.993 --> 02:49.299
Doctor,

02:49.343 --> 02:50.996
are you sure you're all right
to be back at work?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.346
I mean, it really
hasn't been that long

02:52.389 --> 02:53.782
since Mum flambéed you.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.567
Yes. It certainly was a...

02:56.611 --> 02:58.221
traumatic experience.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.136
Fortunately, I'm trained to deal
with that sort of thing,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.355
and I'm doing just that.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.531
And there's nothing
I can do to help?

03:03.574 --> 03:05.924
Yes. You can let me
get back to you.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.144
Oh, if you insist.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.756
Oh, I haven't even told you
the worst part, have I?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.541
Not only did he stick
my wings back on

03:13.584 --> 03:16.065
and take my face,
he's stolen my shtick as well.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.546
He gives out favors to people

03:18.589 --> 03:20.417
for a price to be named later.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.984
Sound familiar?

03:22.027 --> 03:26.336
Lucifer, you didn't invent
the idea of giving out favors.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.339
[chuckles] Yep,
forgot who I was talking to.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.385
I suppose you did.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.648
But you haven't given
out favors in a while.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.215
And the Sinnerman knows it.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.042
I think he's
taunting me.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.392
Do you think he's human?

03:38.435 --> 03:39.958
Or something else?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.743
I don't know.

03:41.786 --> 03:45.268
But whatever he is, I'm gonna
stop at nothing to find him.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.356
CHLOE:
We found him.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.358
LUCIFER:
Who? The missing link?

03:48.402 --> 03:50.534
Proof of human-rodent
copulation.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.927
It's Mike Alonso.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.711
The guy that skewered your
kidnapper under the pier.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.279
[scoffs] This is clearly
not the Sinnerman.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.281
Clearly not,
since I'm pretty sure

03:58.325 --> 04:00.109
that no one with that name
actually exists.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.938
He had motive, no alibi,

04:02.981 --> 04:05.070
and, oh, yeah,
he confessed

04:05.114 --> 04:06.942
under interrogation.
He's our guy.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.683
Well, then he must be
working for the Sinnerman.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.294
You're not gonna drag me

04:11.338 --> 04:13.078
into whatever new
weird drama this is.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.689
And could you please

04:14.732 --> 04:16.168
stop saying "Sinnerman"?

04:16.212 --> 04:17.474
Sinnerman.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.434
Big Nina Simone fan?

04:20.477 --> 04:21.609
Well, actually, I am.
But I was just sayingWhat? Nothing.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.827
to the detective...Nothing. It's nothing.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.831
Are you hiding something
from me, Detective?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.747
No.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.358
I don't care;
I was just asking.

04:31.401 --> 04:34.056
New case came in,
you're up.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.144
Thank you.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.711
[sighs]

04:36.754 --> 04:39.322
Okay. Why did you just stop me
telling the new lieutenant

04:39.366 --> 04:41.150
we're on the cusp of the
greatest case of our lives?

04:41.193 --> 04:44.545
Because the Sinnerman is an
urban myth; he doesn't exist.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.329
He's a boogeyman
that criminals use

04:46.373 --> 04:47.635
to hide their bad behavior.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.289
"Oh, the Sinnerman
made me do it."

04:49.332 --> 04:50.725
Yet another thing
he's stolen from me,

04:50.768 --> 04:53.293
being blamed for
the bad deeds of men.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.643
He can keep that one, actually.[scoffs] So the idea

04:55.686 --> 04:58.080
of telling our new boss--

04:58.123 --> 05:00.169
who I'm just starting
to get a rhythm with--

05:00.212 --> 05:02.345
that you want to arrest
the Easter Bunny

05:02.389 --> 05:03.738
doesn't really thrill me.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.217
I have no intention
of arresting anyone.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.915
I want to grab him by his
neck and see what happens

05:06.958 --> 05:08.351
when I squeeze hard enough.

05:08.395 --> 05:12.312
If you can bring me
any tiny bit of evidence

05:12.355 --> 05:13.922
that the Sinnerman
actually exists,

05:13.965 --> 05:15.489
I will be the first
to look into it.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.360
But...

05:17.404 --> 05:21.233
until then,
consider this case closed.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.192
And let's focus
on this case, please.

LUCIFER:
[whistles] Daniel?

05:53.396 --> 05:55.659
Guy's name
is JD Woodstock.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.487
He lived right
around the corner.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.141
Neighbors said he
was pretty quiet.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.708
Unemployed, but we
found this on him.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.449
Huh.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.061
So what are these? Jokes?

06:06.104 --> 06:08.542
A charitable description,
Detective.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.543
"Avocado?

06:09.586 --> 06:11.545
How about avoca-don't?"

06:11.588 --> 06:13.242
Would it be rude
to throw tomatoes at a corpse?

06:13.285 --> 06:15.070
DAN: Looks like he was
a struggling comedian.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.289
We're trying to figure out
if he performed anywhere.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.595
What'd he do? Make
fun of the wrong person?

06:18.639 --> 06:20.031
Get in a fight with
an audience member?

06:20.075 --> 06:21.685
It's worth exploring,
at least.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.513
You know, there are a lot
of insult comics out there,

06:23.557 --> 06:25.472
and not everybody
enjoys being mocked.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.995
Hmm. We should listen
to Daniel, actually.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.649
He's got a unique
insight into this case.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.433
What's he talking about?

06:30.477 --> 06:31.652
Well, they're
kindred spirits.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.610
A fellow broken
soul who puts

06:33.654 --> 06:35.003
the most embarrassing parts
of his life on display

06:35.046 --> 06:36.439
for his audience
for an easy laugh.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.702
He does stand-up;
I do improv.

06:38.746 --> 06:39.790
They're completely
different things.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.139
Oh.
Improv

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
is all about "yes, and."

06:42.706 --> 06:44.055
Stand-up, well, that's about
telling jokes...

06:44.099 --> 06:45.840
I-I regret starting
this entire conversation.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.059
Wait. Excuse me, Dan.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.234
You do improv?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.802
How did I not know that?
And how did he?

06:51.846 --> 06:53.587
Well, it's a funny story,
actually.Actually,

06:53.630 --> 06:55.284
it's because I-I don't
tell a lot of people.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.241
Why?

06:56.285 --> 06:57.808
Yeah-- hey, Ella.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.593
How's it going?
What'd you find?

06:59.636 --> 07:02.639
Well, no murder weapon, but I
did find three shell casings.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.641
Running ballistics
on them now.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.383
But, based on the
firing pattern,

07:07.427 --> 07:10.734
I think this dude was tortured
before he finally died.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.649
Oh, well congratulations,
Mr. Woodstock.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.738
At least someone cared enough
about your jokes to...

07:14.782 --> 07:15.739
ELLA: Did you just
say Woodstock?

07:15.783 --> 07:18.176
As in, JD Woodstock?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.395
Yeah. Why?
You know him?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.614
Yeah. He made big news
a couple days ago,

07:20.657 --> 07:22.529
claiming Bobby Lowe
stole his jokes.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.661
And who is Bobby Lowe?
A rival comedian

07:24.705 --> 07:26.750
who hates himself so much
he stole this drivel?

07:26.794 --> 07:29.884
Uh, no.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.625
Open your eyes, pal.

07:31.668 --> 07:34.062
Yeah. JD claimed
that Bobby's show

07:34.105 --> 07:35.498
was based on
his own material.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.673
And that he
could prove it.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.370
Which is impossible,

07:38.414 --> 07:40.677
because Bobby Lowe's show
is all about his life.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.636
Wait, so you're saying that
this giant-headed buffoon

07:42.679 --> 07:44.681
stole our poor
victim's ideas?

07:44.725 --> 07:46.944
His life's work
and built a business out of it?

07:46.988 --> 07:49.773
Mm. So now he's a "poor victim."

07:49.817 --> 07:51.601
Look, I know you don't
believe me, Detective,

07:51.645 --> 07:53.516
but I happen to be going through
something quite similar,

07:53.560 --> 07:54.865
so if I can't get
my own justice,

07:54.909 --> 07:58.565
I'm gonna get it for
this poor unfunny soul.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.393
Well, I certainly did want you
to focus on this case,

08:01.437 --> 08:03.134
but be careful
what you wish for.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.528

What have we got in here?You can't touch those puppets.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.590
Does anyone work here?!

17:06.634 --> 17:09.071
Ah, here we go. All right,
this one looks good.
No.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.377
No, no, n-no,

17:10.420 --> 17:12.248

17:12.292 --> 17:15.686

has their hand up my butt?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.081
Actually, this apparatus
is more difficult than...

17:19.125 --> 17:20.865
BOBBY: Seriously, put it down.Ah, there's the trigger.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.563
Right. Where was I?
[silly voice]: You...

17:22.606 --> 17:24.869

just get down, get down.

Oh, don't worry, everyone.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.399
There's just a gun
stashed inside the puppet.

17:32.442 --> 17:35.010
Lucifer, put the gun down.LUCIFER: Right.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.707
Right. Yes.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.361
Well, at least no one was hurt.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.628
Uh... he did it.

17:48.502 --> 17:51.026
Are you insane? You
could've killed him.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.595
Me? I'm not the one who hid
a gun up a puppet's backside.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.770
Or have all the puppets
got guns in them?

17:55.813 --> 17:57.076
If so, I'll set my DVR.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.382
No. We never used that puppet.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.297
It was my imaginary friend's
imaginary friend.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.603
The character didn't land.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.213
I wonder why.So you hid a gun in it?

18:04.257 --> 18:05.432
I didn't think some lunatic

18:05.475 --> 18:06.607
was gonna try to kill me
with it.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.999
It's just a flesh wound.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.305
And you admit
that it's your gun?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.611
Yeah.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.308
Ah, I see.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.223
So you killed our poor victim,
ran back to work

18:14.267 --> 18:15.703
and keistered it
in an old puppet.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.183
ELLA:
Not the murder weapon.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.621
This is a .380, and the
murderer used a 9mm.

18:20.664 --> 18:23.232
All that means is that he hid
his other gun somewhere else.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.452
So come on. Prostate exams
for all the puppets.

have another gun.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.979
I didn't kill JD.

I don't believe you.
You're a thief.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.636
You took everything JD had,
even his life.

could you possibly desire?

when they talk to themselves.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.971
And now that JD's dead,
I'm never getting out of here.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.538
What do you mean?

19:08.582 --> 19:10.758
[sighs]

19:10.801 --> 19:12.673
He was telling the truth.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.418
I stole his act.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.333
I based the show on it.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.685
But I defended you!

19:24.728 --> 19:27.470
J'accuse,Bobby Lowe!

19:27.514 --> 19:28.689
J'accuse!

19:30.256 --> 19:32.127
If you wanted out
of the job so bad,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.998
why didn't you
just admit it and quit?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.436
Golden handcuffs.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.655
If I quit, I lose all the money.

And I really like the money.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.226

that you were stealing

19:44.270 --> 19:45.793
his act, and they fire you...

19:45.836 --> 19:47.795
I get a golden parachute
instead.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.014
Which is why I had
to keep up appearances,

19:50.058 --> 19:51.886
not let anyone know the truth.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.236
But why hide the gun on set?Yeah.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.759
Because I was getting
death threats.

19:55.803 --> 19:59.328
Someone's pissed, claiming
all my jokes are about him.

19:59.372 --> 20:02.288
The jokes that you stole
like the thief which you are?

20:02.331 --> 20:04.028
That's a big strong,
Miss Lopez.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.727
Yeah.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.904
Any idea who was making
these threats?

20:09.947 --> 20:12.254
They came
from an anonymous e-mail.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.604
But like I said,
I stole the jokes.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.954
The only person who knows
who they're about...

20:16.998 --> 20:18.956
Is the dead guy. Great.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.089
I'm gonna need those e-mails.

We all have pain

21:39.385 --> 21:41.778
Looks like the threats
stopped last week

21:41.822 --> 21:44.346
after JD posted his video.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.348
So you think the killer saw it
and then realized

21:46.392 --> 21:48.655
he'd been threatening the
wrong comedian the entire time?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.483
And then killed JD

21:50.526 --> 21:52.789
he was the guy
actually making fun of him.

21:52.833 --> 21:53.877
Seems possible.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.096
So...

21:55.139 --> 21:56.793
what's the joke
that he's so angry about?

21:56.837 --> 21:58.969
Did our killer have
unfunny imaginary friends?

21:59.013 --> 22:01.581
No, that happened later.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.496
I did some research,
and originally,

22:03.539 --> 22:05.672

didn't want to tell you.

a family show...
Mm.

I think our killer
is the victim here.

Yeah, that's actually
not how it works.

But if Lucifer wants to treat
his wings like trash,

26:58.704 --> 27:01.663
then trash they shall be.
Even if it pains me

27:01.707 --> 27:03.273
in my very soul.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.363
I don't think Lucifer knows
how much this hurts you.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.670
He never does.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.106
And even though he
doesn't realize it,

27:10.150 --> 27:14.676
everything he does seems
designed to hurt me.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.331
To test you?

27:20.073 --> 27:21.552
Huh. Wow.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.079
You're right.

27:26.122 --> 27:30.126
It's been right in front
of my face all along.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.693
My test is Lucifer.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.434
It's always been Lucifer.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.396
You're very wise, Linda.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.094
Thanks, Amen.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.487
Mm...Yeah, it doesn't work, does it?

27:43.531 --> 27:45.141
[laughs softly]

27:45.185 --> 27:48.057
♪ Ooh

27:48.101 --> 27:50.277
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh

27:50.320 --> 27:53.410

27:56.065 --> 27:58.720
[Lucifer panting]

27:58.764 --> 28:00.722
I, uh, had a rather
illuminating conversation

28:00.766 --> 28:02.289
with our new lieutenant
last night.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.030
What did you do?
Nothing.

28:04.073 --> 28:06.423
Yet. He warned me not
to talk about the Sinnerman.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.642
Yeah, he's right.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.252
You sound crazy... er.

28:09.296 --> 28:10.732
No. He actually knows...

28:10.776 --> 28:13.039
Cyber tracked all the e-mails
to the same I.P. address.

28:13.082 --> 28:15.128
A comedy club on Sunset
called The Laughmaker.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.738
So do we think
he works there?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.218
Maybe. The e-mails
were always sent

28:18.261 --> 28:20.046
Thursday nights at 8:00 p.m.And that's when

28:20.089 --> 28:21.090
Bobby's show aired.
So it makes sense

28:21.134 --> 28:22.352
that that could set him off.

28:22.396 --> 28:23.919
Yeah, it's also when
they have open mic night,

28:23.963 --> 28:25.704
so it could be any one of
the comedians performing, too.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.270
Or a diehard fan.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.750
Either way,
they're consistent.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.056
It would make sense
that the killer

28:30.099 --> 28:31.361
could be at the next
open mic night.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.536
Which is tonight.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.234
So how do we draw him out?LUCIFER: Easy.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.410
Arrest everyone in the club
and pull their pants down.

28:36.453 --> 28:37.977
Tiniest weenie wins, for once.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.414
Or, our guy is clearly
sensitive, right?

28:40.457 --> 28:41.937
Why don't we use that
to flush him out?

28:41.981 --> 28:44.070
What, get someone on stage
that'll really piss him off?

28:44.113 --> 28:46.159
Yeah. Yeah,
that could work.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.117
And I think we all know
the perfect man for that job.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.294
WOMAN:
All right,

28:51.338 --> 28:54.341
please welcome to the stage,
for the first time,

28:54.384 --> 28:56.691
the devilishly
handsome...

28:56.735 --> 28:59.738
Dan Espinoza.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.528
Remember "yes, and," Daniel.

Hey. Hi.

29:18.887 --> 29:19.888
[clears throat]

29:19.932 --> 29:21.107

29:21.150 --> 29:22.325
Um...[microphone feedback]

29:22.369 --> 29:24.023
MAN: Oh...
[short chuckle]

29:24.066 --> 29:25.894
Uh, I have a friend.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.897
And... he's got a tiny penis.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.725
WOMAN: What?
Uh...

29:30.769 --> 29:32.553
a micropenis.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.468
Uh, in fact,

29:34.511 --> 29:36.600
his penis is so tiny,[woman groans]

29:36.644 --> 29:39.212
it's not even a micropenis.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.604
It's an atomic penis.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.824
[laughs]

29:42.868 --> 29:44.870
[mouthing]
Because atoms
are small.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.524
Not because it ex... plodes.

29:47.568 --> 29:48.830
[Dan clears throat]

29:48.874 --> 29:51.528
His, uh, penis is so small...Boo!

29:51.572 --> 29:54.618
It's a medical condition,
you monster.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.403
[audience cheers]

29:59.058 --> 30:00.842
Lucifer...What? Can't stop, won't stop.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.235
This is much too
fun, Detective.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.411
No, no, no, keep going.
I want you to keep going.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.412
Copy that.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.848
DAN: Anyways...So what?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.458
Next you're gonna tell us
that his willy's

30:08.502 --> 30:10.504
so small that
when he wants to have sex,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.158
he needs to call out
a search party?

30:12.201 --> 30:15.248
[audience laughs]Or that his weenis
is so small,

30:15.291 --> 30:16.771
it looks like his
testicles are giving

30:16.815 --> 30:18.381
[high-pitched]:
the tiniest thumbs up?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.469
[audience laughs]Huh?

30:19.513 --> 30:20.514
Shame on you

30:20.557 --> 30:22.516
for mocking the poorly-endowed.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.866
MAN: Yeah!LUCIFER: Oh, hold on.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.389
Maybe there's no friend at all,

30:26.433 --> 30:28.174
and you're the one
with the baby carrot.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.045
[chuckles]:
What? No.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.178
No, I-I... I-I don't
have a micropenis.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.267
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with having one.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.703
Come on.
Now's your chance.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.574
Show the world your teeny, tiny,
itsy-bitsy baby arm.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.620
I-I... I don't have
a tiny, teeny...

It's okay!

for your miniscule manhood.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.544

Get off.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.459
Or show us
your nubbin. Hmm?

There you go!

30:59.945 --> 31:02.164
Oh, lovely.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.557
What the hell was that, man?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.689
You undermined
the entire sting.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.517
Well, I'd argue
you undermined it

31:07.561 --> 31:08.997
with your botched
attempt at humor.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.825
[scoffs]All I did was throw
a drowning man a tomato.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.609
Oh, what are the chances?

31:12.653 --> 31:14.481
I didn't even want to
do this to begin with.

31:14.524 --> 31:18.093
And I told you stand-up and
improv are completely different.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.616
And why didn't you stop him?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.096
Because I realized the killer

31:21.140 --> 31:22.532
might seek out
a sympathetic voice.

31:22.576 --> 31:23.577
Hmm.He wasn't sympathetic.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.622
He just used it as an excuse

31:25.666 --> 31:28.103
to tell even more
micropenis jokes.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.540
There is no way anyone's
gonna appreciate that.

Hey, man.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.717

wanted to say...

31:33.761 --> 31:35.458
really appreciate you
saying what you did.

31:35.502 --> 31:37.678
Huh.Ah.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.941
Absolutely.
No problem at all.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.509
I mean, someone has to stand up
for the little guy, am I right?

31:42.552 --> 31:43.553
Yeah.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.947
Hearing stuff like that just...

31:45.991 --> 31:47.296
makes you
want to murder someone,

31:47.340 --> 31:48.515
doesn't it?

31:48.558 --> 31:50.691
Sure does.
Hmm.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.867
Well done, Detective.
Right, just to be sure,

31:52.911 --> 31:55.435
shall I pull his pants down,
or do you want the honors?

31:56.740 --> 31:57.959
You're gonna
do what?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.047
Follow me.What?

what you're doing. ♪

32:03.617 --> 32:06.272
I don't understand.

Having a micropenis
isn't a crime.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.798
[chuckles]So you didn't send threatening
e-mails to Bobby Lowe?

32:10.841 --> 32:12.974
No, I did.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.324
Back when Bobby was nobody,
I toured with him.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.196
And that's when I figured
he heard about my...

32:17.239 --> 32:18.632
condition.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.068
[laughs softly]

32:20.112 --> 32:22.766
Um, how would he have
heard about that?

All the chuckle bunnies talk.

32:23.985 --> 32:24.943
The what?

chicks who like to
have sex with comedians.

32:27.684 --> 32:28.903
Oh, there's a term for that?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.687
Oh, I should get
a term. [chuckles]

32:30.731 --> 32:32.080
Oh.
Devil bunnies.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.516
Oh, no. Lucifans.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.301
Can you please...?
Or not.

32:35.344 --> 32:36.998
One in particular,
I told some stories,

32:37.042 --> 32:39.653
and then, I heard them
as part of Bobby's set.

32:39.696 --> 32:40.915
So then,
you started threatening him.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.699
I was blowing off steam, okay?

32:42.743 --> 32:44.005
Every time
that stupid show aired,

32:44.049 --> 32:45.833
it was like
a punch in the gut.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.879
And then you found out
that JD was writing the jokes.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.577
And justifiably
murdered him.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.144
I forgave him.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.580
LUCIFER:
What?

32:53.623 --> 32:56.017
But he stole your life story
and profited from it.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.453
Why would you forgive him?

32:57.497 --> 33:00.108
I don't mind a fellow
struggling comic busting balls.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.285
It's when a millionaire starts
punching down that I get pissed.

33:03.329 --> 33:06.071
Or that good-looking jerk
from the club.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.637
What? Who's he talking about?CHLOE: Oh.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.683
Dan.
Oh. Right.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.685
Are you sure?
[mutters]

33:11.728 --> 33:14.601
Besides, JD's life
was pretty sad.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.777
I mean, I think
his last gig was a barbecue.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.867
He even made up this sad story
about a warm-up comic wanting

33:19.910 --> 33:21.738
to meet with him about a gig.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.827
[laughs] As if that'd happen.LUCIFER: Why?

33:23.871 --> 33:26.265
Is telling bad jokes before
even worse jokes a coveted gig?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.570
Are you kidding?

33:27.614 --> 33:29.703
You work an hour a day
and clear six figures.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.357
Not to mention,
you probably get a role

33:31.400 --> 33:32.706
in the show at some point.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.708
Oh.
Really?

33:34.751 --> 33:37.493
Do you remember the name
of the, uh, warm-up comedian?

33:37.537 --> 33:40.714
Uh, Shelly maybe, or...?

33:40.757 --> 33:42.585
Sheila?
Yeah, that was it.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.891
Do you know her?

what did I miss?

33:48.678 --> 33:49.984
Who's Sheila?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.855
Sheila's the name of
Bobby Lowe's warm-up comedian.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.989
Right.

33:59.863 --> 34:02.997
Detective, are you sure
that Sheila's here?

34:03.041 --> 34:07.741
Her roommate said that she'd be
here working on new jokes, so...

34:07.784 --> 34:09.786
Well, I still
don't understand.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.746
She seemed devastated when
Bobby said he was a joke thief.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.923
Well, maybe she's not
pissed off about the theft.

34:15.966 --> 34:20.667
What? Well, then, what else
would she be angry about?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.234

weren't creepy enough.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.456
Did she do this to you?

35:54.500 --> 35:55.979
I told her I was gonna quit,

35:56.023 --> 35:58.460
and-and she freaked out
on me, started screaming

35:58.504 --> 36:00.070
about everything
she-she'd done for me.

But I-I can't
take it any-anymore. My craft...

later. How long ago?

Uh, a few minutes maybe.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.862
We-we heard you come in,
and then she hit me

36:08.905 --> 36:11.212
with the butt of her,
of her gun... in the face!

36:11.256 --> 36:13.258
She has a gun?Did-did you hear me?!

36:13.301 --> 36:15.999
I said, in-in the face!
This is my moneymaker!

36:16.043 --> 36:18.698
Am I okay?Lucifer, she's here!

36:18.741 --> 36:20.134
No.
She's armed!

36:25.879 --> 36:27.446
[boards creaking]

36:31.885 --> 36:33.800
Why did you do
it, Sheila?

36:35.976 --> 36:38.065
Get out of the way!

36:38.108 --> 36:39.284
I'm getting out of here.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.807
Well, once you
answer my question,

36:40.850 --> 36:42.765
I'll gladly let you past.

36:42.809 --> 36:46.900
Why kill and torture a man
for this pretentious hack?

36:46.943 --> 36:50.338
Do you know how hard it is to
crawl out of the stand-up world

36:50.382 --> 36:51.818
and get a gig like this?

36:51.861 --> 36:54.255
LUCIFER:
But he's a fellow comedian.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.996
Why would you kill for someone

36:56.039 --> 36:57.911
who stole jokes from
one of your own?

36:57.954 --> 36:59.173
So he stole material.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.176
Hell, he stole half my set, too.
Who cares?!

37:02.220 --> 37:03.395
LUCIFER:
You should!

37:03.438 --> 37:05.658
It's yours!

37:05.701 --> 37:07.964
One might say your
very identity.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.793
Jokes don't make a comedian.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.665
Everyone has an itchy butt joke.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.275
It's all about
what you do with it.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.016
What you do with
your itchy butt?

37:16.059 --> 37:18.584
With the joke!
Oh.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.108
So, what you're saying is,

37:21.151 --> 37:23.371
it's okay to steal
someone's work as long

37:23.415 --> 37:24.720
as you do it better?

37:24.764 --> 37:27.157
And take me with you?
Hell yeah, it is.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.159
Oh...
Now, if you don't
get out of my way...

37:31.161 --> 37:32.815
I swear... [gasps]

37:32.859 --> 37:34.426
[grunts]

37:34.469 --> 37:36.384
[sighs]

37:36.428 --> 37:38.647
Excellent work, Detective.

37:42.172 --> 37:45.306
Okay, so... how do we get her
down from here?

37:52.182 --> 37:54.228
Daniel?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.491
You're not gonna throw a tomato
at me, are you?
Ugh.

37:56.535 --> 37:57.971
Come now, Daniel.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.408
I only did that for
the good of the case.[sighs]

38:00.452 --> 38:02.628
Also, I ran out,
but more importantly,

38:02.671 --> 38:04.107
did you text me to come here?

38:04.151 --> 38:05.848
I didn't recognize the number,
so I assumed it was you.

38:05.892 --> 38:07.197
You didn't save my number?

38:07.241 --> 38:08.329
PIERCE:
It was me.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.646
Too much hard work
to break into my penthouse again

38:20.689 --> 38:22.169
for a heart-to-heart?

38:22.212 --> 38:24.650
I did some digging,
and you were right.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.042
The Sinnerman is here in L.A.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.001
Oh, right.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.263
Are you not gonna
take my advice

38:29.307 --> 38:32.048
from last night?Most definitely not.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.572
I thought so.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.274
You brought the Sinnerman's
murderous thug in.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.364
PIERCE:
He's all yours.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.758
I couldn't get anything
out of him. Maybe you can.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.108
[laughing]:
Oh. Right.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.936
So, what, is this
you passing the baton?

38:49.979 --> 38:51.981
Where are you running
off to next?
Nowhere.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.505
I'm seeing this through.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.898
But you need to shut your
damn mouth about the Sinnerman.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.596
We need to play this carefully.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.162
Let's keep it between us.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.164
[scoffs]
The less people
who know about it,

39:01.208 --> 39:02.731
the less chance
anyone gets hurt.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.038
But the detective...Has a kid.

39:05.081 --> 39:07.649
She stays out of it.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.131
[sighs]

39:11.174 --> 39:12.872
Very well.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.790
[chuckles softly]

39:26.189 --> 39:28.540
Hello, Alonso.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.456
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

39:31.499 --> 39:34.807
I know the Sinnerman had you
skewer Sam under the pier,

39:34.850 --> 39:36.896
so tell me everything.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.463
Who the hell's the Sinnerman?

39:38.506 --> 39:41.291
[laughs]

39:41.335 --> 39:43.250
Fine.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.252
Fine. Let's play
a little game, shall we?

39:45.295 --> 39:46.384
Look at me.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.909
Tell me.

39:49.952 --> 39:54.435
Why did you really
desire Sam's death?

39:54.479 --> 39:57.960
I... didn't want my girl
to sleep with him anymore.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.356
And?

40:02.400 --> 40:05.228
And... that's it.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.230
I got pissed.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.407
Went medieval on his ass
to send a message.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.583
No one touches my girl.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.715
And what about the Sinnerman?

40:13.759 --> 40:15.891
Man, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.676
Oh, you must know.
Come on, Alonso.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.242
What about the Sinnerman?

40:19.286 --> 40:20.809
I don't know.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.637
You must know!

40:24.552 --> 40:26.641
I don't know
anything... I swear.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.211
[swallows hard]

40:32.386 --> 40:34.127
I believe you.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.916
LUCIFER:
He was telling the truth.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.657
I mean, maybe

40:42.701 --> 40:45.443
the Sinnerman manipulated Alonso
without him realizing it.

40:45.486 --> 40:48.358
Or perhaps he was just
a deranged fellow who felt

40:48.402 --> 40:50.665
impaling a rival lover to death
was the way to his girl's heart.

40:52.406 --> 40:55.148
It's a bit old-fashioned,
really.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.978
Lucifer, I want
to talk about your wings.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.328
Oh, bloody hell.
They're not out again?!

41:01.371 --> 41:03.417
So they grew back?

41:04.549 --> 41:07.160
They did... this morning.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.075
Sneaky buggers.

41:09.118 --> 41:11.512
You can't keep doing this
to yourself.Oh, I agree.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.862
You do?
Yes.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.865
It's getting exhausting...
and quite messy.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.259
No, I need a new solution.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.957
Maybe I should hire someone
to do it.

41:22.001 --> 41:25.004
Or maybe your solution is

41:25.047 --> 41:28.573
to accept that, for now,
you have wings again.

41:28.616 --> 41:32.359
What, and let Dad win,
or whoever it bloody is?

41:32.402 --> 41:34.317
I... I don't think so.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.888
It's easy to let
external factors... define us.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.455
[clock ticking]

41:41.499 --> 41:43.413
Especially the traumatic ones.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.374
But only if we let them.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.597
We all have itchy butts.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.076
Excuse me?

41:54.120 --> 41:55.556
No, it's just something
a woman said to me

41:55.600 --> 41:57.036
right before
I punched her in the face.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.257
It's not about the idea.
It's about the execution.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.346
It's about how I usethe wings.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.827
That's... actually...

42:05.871 --> 42:07.829
pretty wise.

42:07.873 --> 42:09.527
Yeah. So I'll just
tuck them away

42:09.570 --> 42:11.354
and pretend they don't exist.Less good.

42:11.398 --> 42:13.269
Someone else is giving favors.
Who cares?

42:14.444 --> 42:16.403
I'm Lucifer bloody Morningstar!

42:16.446 --> 42:18.448
I do favors better
than anyone else.

42:18.492 --> 42:22.191
Amongst other things,
of course.

42:22.235 --> 42:24.324
Or at least, I used to.

42:24.367 --> 42:26.500
And I think that maybe...

42:28.371 --> 42:30.025
...it's about time
I got back in the game.
