00:08.531 --> 00:10.515
Hello.

00:10.517 --> 00:11.916
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

00:11.918 --> 00:13.551
and welcome to
the premiere episode

00:13.553 --> 00:18.573
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:
Fun with Flags.

00:18.575 --> 00:22.744
Over the next 52 weeks,
you and I are going to explore

00:22.746 --> 00:25.830
the dynamic world
of vexillology.

00:25.832 --> 00:27.866
Hang on, Dr. C.

00:27.868 --> 00:30.001
What's vexillology?

00:31.404 --> 00:34.506
Vexillology is
the study of flags.

00:34.508 --> 00:36.674
Cool.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.795
I think I just
learned something.

00:40.797 --> 00:42.197
Did you have fun doing it?

00:42.199 --> 00:44.933
I'll say.

00:44.935 --> 00:49.087
Fun and information are two
sides to this video podcast,

00:49.089 --> 00:52.307
not unlike the only
two-sided state flag--

00:52.309 --> 00:54.642
Oregon.

00:54.644 --> 00:56.478
Oh, look.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.531
Hello, Mr. Beaver.

00:59.533 --> 01:03.051
In future episodes, we'll answer
some burning questions:

01:03.053 --> 01:05.553
What's the only
non-rectangular flag?

01:05.555 --> 01:08.406
What animal appears
most often on flags?

01:08.408 --> 01:11.593
What animal appears second
most often on flags?

01:11.595 --> 01:13.795
And more.

01:14.296 --> 01:16.464
Sweet!

01:17.383 --> 01:19.834
Why are you waving
a white flag?

01:19.836 --> 01:21.136
I'm surrendering...

01:21.138 --> 01:23.321
to fun.

01:29.095 --> 01:33.481
Now, today's episode of
Fun with Flags is not fun,

01:33.483 --> 01:35.316
but it is important.

01:35.318 --> 01:37.619
"Flags: you gotta know
how to hold 'em,

01:37.621 --> 01:40.772
you gotta know
how to fold 'em."

01:40.774 --> 01:44.109
Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

01:44.111 --> 01:47.061
This edge is the hoist,
and it's used to...

01:47.063 --> 01:48.780
Excuse me,
sorry, excuse me.

01:48.782 --> 01:49.864
Cut.

01:49.866 --> 01:53.034
Did you not see
we are rolling?

01:53.036 --> 01:54.285
Sorry. I'm having dinner
with Penny.

01:54.287 --> 01:55.703
I have to get out of here.

01:55.705 --> 01:57.455
And I have flag knowledge

01:57.457 --> 01:59.874
that I have to
get out of here!

02:04.798 --> 02:05.797
You okay?

02:05.799 --> 02:07.849
No, I'm a little rattled.

02:07.851 --> 02:11.051
But like the flag over
Fort Sumter, I'm still here.

02:13.139 --> 02:15.156
And... take two.

02:16.008 --> 02:18.510
Hello.

02:18.512 --> 02:19.711
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

02:19.713 --> 02:21.146
and welcome to
the premiere episode

02:21.148 --> 02:25.400
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:
Fun with Flags.

02:25.402 --> 02:29.070
Over the next 52 weeks,
you and I are going to explore

02:29.072 --> 02:31.306
the dynamic world
of vexillology.

02:32.992 --> 02:34.859
Hang on, Dr. Cooper.

02:34.861 --> 02:37.128
What's vexillology?

02:37.130 --> 02:38.730
Vexillology is...

02:38.732 --> 02:41.916
why is there a face
on that flag?

02:41.918 --> 02:43.751
It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

02:43.753 --> 02:46.538
I thought he might help bring in
some younger viewers.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.173
Confound it!

02:48.175 --> 02:49.757
You're right, it's brilliant.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.202
That was a really
nice dinner.

03:18.204 --> 03:19.787
I'm glad you asked me
out again.

03:19.789 --> 03:21.823
Me, too; I missed you.

03:21.825 --> 03:24.208
You see me all the time.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.544
You sure you just
don't miss the sex?

03:27.746 --> 03:30.331
Well, yeah, sex with you
is pretty great.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.033
Have you ever tried it?

03:33.035 --> 03:34.302
I have.

03:34.304 --> 03:36.721
You are not wrong.

03:36.723 --> 03:39.140
I just think if we're
gonna try dating again,

03:39.142 --> 03:41.259
we should take things slow.

03:41.261 --> 03:43.511
Oh, I can take it slow.

03:43.513 --> 03:45.546
Did I ever tell you
about my first girlfriend

03:45.548 --> 03:47.732
in high school,
Karen Berberick?

03:47.734 --> 03:51.569
To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.

03:51.571 --> 03:56.390
Made it easier on her
when I broke things off.

03:56.392 --> 03:59.110
Okay, well, maybe
not <i>that</i> slow.

03:59.112 --> 04:00.445
How about this,

04:00.447 --> 04:02.062
are you familiar with
the typical development

04:02.064 --> 04:04.499
for computer software?

04:04.501 --> 04:07.502
You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

04:07.504 --> 04:09.570
Before an application
is released,

04:09.572 --> 04:10.922
they give it a trial run.

04:10.924 --> 04:12.590
W-We could do that.

04:12.592 --> 04:15.676
And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad,

04:15.678 --> 04:17.595
just say, "Hey, we found a bug,"

04:17.596 --> 04:20.414
and we report it
so it can be fixed.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.383
You mean like a beta test?

04:22.385 --> 04:25.436
Well, technically,
this would be an alpha test.

04:25.438 --> 04:27.772
A beta test requires people
that weren't involved

04:27.774 --> 04:29.089
in the development
of the appli...

04:29.091 --> 04:32.109
Seriously, do I not get credit
for knowing beta test?

04:32.111 --> 04:33.861
No, you should.

04:33.863 --> 04:34.896
Absolutely.

04:34.898 --> 04:36.263
That was me being pedantic.

04:36.265 --> 04:38.533
That's our first bug.

04:38.535 --> 04:39.934
You reported it.

04:39.936 --> 04:41.118
I can fix that.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.453
See? This is good.

04:42.455 --> 04:43.871
All right.

04:43.873 --> 04:45.105
Let's give it a shot.

04:45.107 --> 04:47.107
Great. You keep a list,
I'll keep a list.

04:47.109 --> 04:48.442
At some point, we'll exchange.

04:48.444 --> 04:50.878
Okay.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.447
- Good night, Leonard.
- Night.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.453
Attaboy, Hofstadter.

04:59.455 --> 05:01.005
Nothing gets the ladies hotter

05:01.007 --> 05:04.291
than software development
analogies.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.294
Hey, I'm back.

05:07.296 --> 05:08.930
Cut.

05:12.401 --> 05:15.453
Take 47.

05:18.407 --> 05:21.409
Here's an interesting
fact about flags.

05:21.411 --> 05:23.644
I will take that action.

05:23.646 --> 05:25.663
The flags
of Liechtenstein and Haiti

05:25.665 --> 05:28.065
were identical by coincidence,

05:28.067 --> 05:30.317
a fact that wasn't discovered
until they competed

05:30.319 --> 05:32.987
against each other
at the 1936 Olympics.

05:32.989 --> 05:33.955
And thankfully,

05:33.957 --> 05:35.423
their embarrassment
was overshadowed

05:35.425 --> 05:37.842
by the rise of Fascism.

05:40.512 --> 05:41.929
Let's see the new phone.

05:41.931 --> 05:43.831
I stopped on the way to work.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.851
Hey, do you want to peel
the plastic off with me?

05:46.853 --> 05:48.719
Really?

05:48.721 --> 05:51.188
Me?

05:51.190 --> 05:52.673
That's, like, the best part.

05:52.675 --> 05:53.941
Grab a corner.

05:55.177 --> 05:57.211
Whoa, what's your
hurry, cowboy?

05:58.196 --> 05:59.697
Savor the moment.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.693 --> 06:14.245
Oh, yeah.

06:16.081 --> 06:17.498
Speaking of cowboys,

06:17.500 --> 06:22.620
do you know what country has not
one but two cows on its flag?

06:22.622 --> 06:23.554
The tiny

06:23.556 --> 06:25.156
landlocked nation of Andorra.

06:25.158 --> 06:26.674
Oh, the next classic episode

06:26.676 --> 06:28.309
of Sheldon Cooper Presents:
Fun with Flags

06:28.311 --> 06:30.711
is writing itself.

06:32.014 --> 06:34.715
Oh, let me try
the voice recognition.

06:34.717 --> 06:37.868
Hey, I let you peel the plastic,
don't get greedy.

06:39.571 --> 06:41.989
Hello?

06:41.991 --> 06:43.708
Hello.

06:45.577 --> 06:47.578
What's your name?

06:47.580 --> 06:49.614
My name? It's Siri.

06:49.616 --> 06:51.065
Look at that.

06:51.067 --> 06:54.135
There's finally a woman in
your life you can talk to.

06:54.137 --> 06:56.120
Are you single?

06:56.122 --> 06:58.639
I don't have a marital status,

06:58.641 --> 07:00.741
if that's what you're asking.

07:00.743 --> 07:02.793
Yeah, you're right,
that's too personal.

07:02.795 --> 07:04.845
We hardly know each other.

07:06.449 --> 07:07.848
How about a cup of coffee?

07:07.850 --> 07:10.351
I've found six coffee shops.

07:10.353 --> 07:13.554
Three of them
are fairly close to you.

07:13.556 --> 07:16.757
I will see you
gentlemen later.

07:21.229 --> 07:24.799
She is gonna break his heart.

07:31.124 --> 07:32.757
For someone
who has a machine

07:32.759 --> 07:34.692
that can travel anywhere
in time and space,

07:34.694 --> 07:38.829
Doctor Who sure does have
a thing for modern-day London.

07:38.831 --> 07:41.666
Careful, it's that kind of sass

07:41.668 --> 07:45.486
that can get a person uninvited
to this year's Who Con.

07:47.288 --> 07:49.390
Uh, we're not counting
this as a date,

07:49.392 --> 07:51.175
are we?

07:51.177 --> 07:53.911
Um, I'm not sure,

07:53.913 --> 07:57.982
but I think the right
answer here is "no."

07:57.984 --> 08:01.686
Bug report: When a guy asks me
to spend time with him,

08:01.688 --> 08:03.654
maybe he plans something
a little more interesting

08:03.656 --> 08:06.157
than hanging out at home,
watching TV.

08:06.159 --> 08:09.977
Even <i>Doctor Who?</i>

08:09.979 --> 08:11.195
Even <i>Doctor Who.</i>

08:11.197 --> 08:12.312
All right, that's it.

08:12.314 --> 08:14.632
Who Con-- you're out.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.953
Okay, bug report taken.

08:18.955 --> 08:21.038
Next time I will
have a better plan

08:21.040 --> 08:22.373
for our evening's activity.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.491
Well, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:24.493 --> 08:27.628
Oh, wait, here,
almost forgot.

08:27.630 --> 08:28.963
Here.

08:28.965 --> 08:30.014
What's this?

08:30.016 --> 08:31.498
My bug report to you.

08:38.006 --> 08:42.342
Well, that's quite
a list you got there.

08:42.344 --> 08:44.061
It's color coded.

08:44.063 --> 08:45.813
Oh.

08:45.815 --> 08:48.566
Uh, red means
"fix right away."

08:48.568 --> 08:51.202
Yellow is

08:51.204 --> 08:53.821
"eh, whenever you
get a chance."

08:53.823 --> 08:54.872
And green,

08:54.874 --> 08:57.541
is "I could probably
learn to live with it."

08:57.543 --> 09:00.294
There's a key down
here at the bottom.

09:00.296 --> 09:02.213
It's neat, huh?

09:03.750 --> 09:06.383
Yep.

09:06.385 --> 09:09.369
So, have a good night.

09:10.705 --> 09:13.958
Yep.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.677
Look at that.

09:16.679 --> 09:19.430
Some day, we will tell
future generations

09:19.432 --> 09:21.065
that dating used to be hard.

09:21.983 --> 09:24.485
What's baffling me
is what you

09:24.487 --> 09:26.220
could've possibly put
on the list.

09:26.222 --> 09:28.572
"Hair too golden"?

09:28.574 --> 09:30.407
"Laugh too musical"?

09:31.576 --> 09:33.227
"World too much a better place

09:33.229 --> 09:35.329
for her mere presence in it"?

09:36.281 --> 09:37.615
How about "constantly talks

09:37.617 --> 09:39.566
with food in her mouth"?

09:39.568 --> 09:42.887
Her heart's full of love, no
one cares what's in her mouth.

09:47.408 --> 09:51.912
So, Siri, what's happening?

09:51.914 --> 09:53.747
How are you?

09:53.749 --> 09:56.317
I am well.

09:56.319 --> 09:58.652
What are you doing right now?

09:58.654 --> 10:00.821
What am I doing?

10:00.823 --> 10:02.740
I'm talking with you.

10:02.742 --> 10:06.143
You have a beautiful voice.

10:06.145 --> 10:11.398
Thank you,
it's nice to be appreciated.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.685
I bet it is.

10:14.687 --> 10:17.087
Why don't women like me?

10:17.089 --> 10:21.775
Let me check on that.

10:21.777 --> 10:25.579
How about a Web search
for "Why don't women like me?"

10:25.581 --> 10:27.631
No need.

10:27.633 --> 10:30.251
I've already done that.

10:30.253 --> 10:33.220
Siri, do you have a last name?

10:33.222 --> 10:35.422
My name is Siri.

10:35.424 --> 10:37.508
Ah, one name.

10:37.510 --> 10:40.460
Like, uh, Cher,
Madonna, Adele.

10:40.462 --> 10:44.849
All the women who rock me.

10:44.851 --> 10:47.768
My name is Rajesh,
but you can call me Raj.

10:47.770 --> 10:51.005
Would you like me
to call you Raj?

10:51.007 --> 10:54.074
I'd like you
to call me sexy.

10:54.076 --> 10:57.795
From now on, I'll call you sexy.

10:57.797 --> 11:00.764
Okay?

11:00.766 --> 11:03.000
Okay!

11:10.010 --> 11:13.552
Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

11:13.554 --> 11:16.855
I found ten restaurants
whose reviews mention gelato.

11:16.857 --> 11:19.291
Seven of them
are fairly close to you.

11:19.293 --> 11:21.877
Thank you, darling.

11:21.879 --> 11:26.164
You are most certainly
welcome, sexy.

11:27.950 --> 11:31.653
Well done,
Dr. Koothrappali.

11:31.655 --> 11:32.955
I'm sorry?

11:32.957 --> 11:35.557
You've taken a great
evolutionary leap

11:35.559 --> 11:38.627
by abandoning human interaction
and allowing yourself

11:38.629 --> 11:41.813
to romantically bond
with a soulless machine.

11:42.665 --> 11:44.833
Kudos.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.969
I haven't bonded with it.

11:46.971 --> 11:48.353
Oh, no, of course.

11:48.355 --> 11:49.821
I understand.

11:49.823 --> 11:52.774
You're afraid the world
isn't ready for your taboo love.

11:52.776 --> 11:54.993
Your secret's safe with me.

11:54.995 --> 11:57.145
It's just a phone.

12:02.051 --> 12:04.319
Cooper.

12:06.122 --> 12:08.423
Kripke.

12:08.425 --> 12:09.825
Heads up.

12:09.827 --> 12:12.928
Professor Rothman urinated in
the particle physics wab again,

12:12.930 --> 12:16.331
so we're going to move up
his wetirement party.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.017
Fwiday, 5:00-- pot wuck.

12:19.852 --> 12:20.886
Thanks, Barry.

12:20.888 --> 12:22.003
Siri, remind me

12:22.005 --> 12:24.356
Friday morning
to make my famous popovers.

12:24.358 --> 12:27.159
All right, I'll remind you.

12:27.161 --> 12:28.310
You got Siwi, huh?

12:28.312 --> 12:30.479
Voice wecognition
on that thing is terrible.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.180
Wook.

12:32.182 --> 12:35.617
Siwi, can you wecommend
a westauwant?

12:37.470 --> 12:40.072
I'm sorry, Bawwy.

12:42.158 --> 12:46.194
I don't understand
"wecommend a westauwant."

12:50.249 --> 12:51.550
Wisten to me.

12:51.552 --> 12:54.202
Not westauwant; westauwant.

12:55.438 --> 12:57.139
I don't know what you mean

12:57.141 --> 13:00.342
by "not westauwant; westauwant."

13:00.344 --> 13:02.227
See? Total cwap.

13:02.229 --> 13:04.763
You suck, Siwi.

13:04.765 --> 13:06.264
Hey, don't talk to her
like that.

13:06.266 --> 13:07.683
She's a lady.

13:07.685 --> 13:10.852
Well, that wady
took high-wes pictures

13:10.854 --> 13:13.221
of my junk wast night
for Cwaigswist.

13:13.223 --> 13:14.890
Waiter.

13:18.828 --> 13:21.079
It's open.

13:21.948 --> 13:23.332
Hey.

13:23.334 --> 13:24.282
You ready to go?

13:24.284 --> 13:25.417
Yeah, hang on.

13:25.419 --> 13:27.653
Let me just finish this chapter.

13:27.655 --> 13:29.037
Can you finish it later?

13:29.039 --> 13:30.422
No, I can't.

13:30.424 --> 13:34.092
Reading books is a big part of
my life now because, you know,

13:34.094 --> 13:38.246
we'd have more fun things
to talk about if I read more.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.801
Great. Good. Great.

13:42.803 --> 13:44.269
What are you reading?

13:44.271 --> 13:47.305
<i>Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.</i>

13:47.307 --> 13:49.107
They kind of spoil the ending

13:49.109 --> 13:51.476
right in the name of that,
don't they?

13:52.311 --> 13:53.695
All right.

13:53.697 --> 13:56.348
Look, just remember
how this works.

13:56.350 --> 13:58.884
We don't get mad
about these things.

13:58.886 --> 14:00.369
Uh, speaking of which,
I've addressed

14:00.371 --> 14:02.454
your bug report on
my date planning.

14:02.456 --> 14:04.289
Got a really fun
evening for you.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.590
It's kind of a surprise.

14:05.592 --> 14:07.275
All right. Terrific.

14:07.277 --> 14:10.162
Well, let me just go find a pair
of shoes that aren't so tall.

14:10.164 --> 14:12.214
We wouldn't want you
to feel like you were

14:12.216 --> 14:14.566
out for a walk with your mommy.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.254
Thank you.
Yeah.

14:19.256 --> 14:20.622
Oh.

14:20.624 --> 14:23.008
Here's my list
for you-- right there.

14:29.098 --> 14:32.184
All right, fair enough.

14:32.186 --> 14:35.303
I certainly can be quieter
when we kiss.

14:36.239 --> 14:38.240
I thought it was an expression
of passion,

14:38.242 --> 14:40.709
but if it's coming across
as "juicy and weird,"

14:40.711 --> 14:42.861
who wants that?

14:46.132 --> 14:47.982
Uh, uh... I'm sorry.

14:47.984 --> 14:52.087
Can you be more specific
on how my eyebrows are "stupid"?

14:56.158 --> 14:58.977
Na, never mind.
It's right here.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.931
Good timing.

15:02.933 --> 15:04.099
Dinner's almost ready.

15:04.101 --> 15:05.350
Great.

15:05.352 --> 15:07.168
Oh, smells
amazing in here.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.503
Oh, what are we eating?

15:08.505 --> 15:10.021
Oh, an exotic little treat.

15:10.023 --> 15:12.557
I was just talking to Siri
about Peking duck,

15:12.559 --> 15:14.976
and she said she knew
about four Chinese grocers,

15:14.978 --> 15:17.846
two of which were
fairly close to me.

15:17.848 --> 15:20.031
Her spontaneity
is contagious.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.535
Who's Siri?

15:23.537 --> 15:24.870
Is he dating somebody new?

15:24.872 --> 15:27.706
Yes. His phone.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.024
Oh.

15:30.026 --> 15:32.544
Is that cute
or creepy?

15:32.546 --> 15:35.046
Uh-huh.

15:36.499 --> 15:37.949
Can I pour you
some wine?

15:37.951 --> 15:39.084
I think you'll
enjoy it.

15:39.086 --> 15:40.302
The traditional
choice

15:40.304 --> 15:42.337
with Peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc,

15:42.339 --> 15:45.340
but Siri suggested
an off-dry Riesling.

15:45.342 --> 15:46.508
I wasn't sure,

15:46.510 --> 15:48.426
but I didn't want
to have an argument

15:48.428 --> 15:50.762
with her in the middle
of Trader Joe's.

15:53.099 --> 15:57.886
Now, what should we
put Siri in for dinner?

15:57.888 --> 16:01.606
Leopard, sparkles, or

16:01.608 --> 16:03.992
to paraphrase Coco Chanel,

16:03.994 --> 16:07.696
you can never go wrong
with a little black case?

16:10.917 --> 16:13.335
Siri, play some smooth jazz.

16:13.337 --> 16:16.054
Playing smooth jazz.

16:19.025 --> 16:22.260
Oh, my God, Kenny G?!

16:22.262 --> 16:24.963
This woman can read me
like a book.

16:26.232 --> 16:28.366
I can't believe
I bought my soul mate

16:28.368 --> 16:30.585
at Glendale Galleria.

16:35.474 --> 16:38.593
I don't know if
I want to stay.

16:47.987 --> 16:49.437
This is amazing.

16:49.439 --> 16:51.156
How did you even get
this idea?

16:51.158 --> 16:52.324
I called your dad.

16:52.326 --> 16:53.575
I asked him what things

16:53.577 --> 16:55.710
you liked to do
when you were a kid.

16:55.712 --> 16:57.996
This seemed easier
than getting a cow out here

16:57.998 --> 17:00.298
so you could tip it.

17:02.385 --> 17:04.803
Okay, you're kind of
really great.

17:04.805 --> 17:06.338
You mean for a person
whose neck massages

17:06.339 --> 17:09.507
feel like an eagle is trying
to carry you to its nest?

17:10.343 --> 17:11.877
Okay, bug report.

17:11.878 --> 17:13.060
I just complimented you.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.713
You should take it and shut up.

17:14.714 --> 17:15.981
Right. Sorry, sorry.

17:15.983 --> 17:17.482
And stop apologizing
all the time.

17:17.483 --> 17:19.684
Right. Sorry.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.236
All right,
let's shoot stuff.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.320
You want me to show you
what to do?

17:23.323 --> 17:26.023
I play a lot of
<i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

17:26.026 --> 17:28.743
I think I know how
to handle a gat.

17:28.745 --> 17:31.446
Wow. You are cute
when you get all gangsta.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.817
Ooh!

17:43.793 --> 17:46.160
So, I've got a
gunshot wound.

17:47.546 --> 17:50.181
That's pretty
bad-ass.

17:50.183 --> 17:52.851
No, you've got a Reebok
with a gunshot wound

17:52.853 --> 17:54.853
and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.

17:56.857 --> 17:58.974
Hello? They gave
me a Band-Aid.

17:58.976 --> 18:00.341
Hospitals do not
issue Band-Aids

18:00.343 --> 18:01.893
unless it is
medically necessary.

18:01.895 --> 18:03.211
That is the law.

18:05.515 --> 18:08.450
Well, thank you
for a really cool evening.

18:08.452 --> 18:10.518
Thank you for hiding
my <i>Star Wars</i> socks

18:10.520 --> 18:12.537
at the emergency room.

18:14.357 --> 18:17.325
Is it a good time to
evaluate the beta test

18:17.327 --> 18:18.910
and see where we stand?

18:18.912 --> 18:21.413
Things are looking good.

18:21.415 --> 18:23.131
So, are we still
taking things slow?

18:23.133 --> 18:24.499
Because a gunshot
wound today,

18:24.501 --> 18:27.252
and last week, I slammed my
thumb in the kitchen drawer.

18:27.254 --> 18:29.454
We don't know how
much time I have.

18:30.339 --> 18:32.206
Good night, you.

18:48.357 --> 18:50.892
<i>Guten Tag, das</i> YouTube.

18:50.894 --> 18:53.895
<i>Ich bin ein Bavarian.</i>

18:53.897 --> 18:56.231

18:58.000 --> 19:00.368

Cooper Presents: Fun...

19:00.370 --> 19:01.786
Mit...
Flags.

19:01.788 --> 19:05.788
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

19:12.379 --> 19:13.996
First door on the left.

19:13.998 --> 19:16.165
Thank you.

19:22.422 --> 19:26.509
Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner
repair shops in your area.

19:26.511 --> 19:29.011
Four are fairly close to you.

19:32.282 --> 19:33.966
Hello, sexy.

19:33.968 --> 19:36.469
What can I help you with?

19:44.761 --> 19:47.580
If you'd like to make
love to me, just tell me.

19:53.238 --> 19:56.038
I'm sorry. I don't
understand...

19:59.593 --> 20:01.827
No!
