LIKE LOW TIDE.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.857
{\an1}SMELLS MORE LIKE
YOUR ROOM.

19:51.940 --> 19:52.441
Sam:
LET'S FOLLOW

19:52.524 --> 19:54.401
{\an1}THAT TRUCK

19:54.484 --> 19:55.569
{\an1}AND FIND OUT
WHERE IT'S DUMPING.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.447
HAVEN'T WE SEEN ENOUGH GARBAGE
ON THE BEACH?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.617
LOOK, ON THE COMPUTER WHEN YOU
HAVE A PROGRAMMING ERROR

20:01.700 --> 20:03.327
YOU TRACE IT BACK TO THE SOURCE.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.329
THAT SHOULD WORK
IN REAL LIFE, TOO.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.664
I GET WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
TO SAM'S COMPUTER!

20:09.333 --> 20:12.336
TO THE DUMP,
TWIST!

20:12.419 --> 20:13.921
NOW LET'S GO.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.307
HEY, LOOK-- A WRAPPER
FROM MY FAVORITE FREEZY FREEZE.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.101
I SURE LOVE FREEZY FREEZES.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.437
(<i> tires screeching</i> )

20:35.233 --> 20:36.318
(<i> sniffing</i> )

20:55.003 --> 20:57.172
JUST AS I THOUGHT--

20:57.255 --> 20:58.840
THE TOWN DUMP.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.841
NO MORE JOKES ABOUT MY ROOM!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.427
CUT IT OUT, OKAY?!

21:02.511 --> 21:04.429
NO, TWISTER,
THE GARBAGE TRUCK

21:04.513 --> 21:06.098
IS TURNING INTO THE TOWN DUMP.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.349
LET'S GO.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.564
(<i> kids cry out in disgust</i> )

21:14.648 --> 21:15.607
(<i> sniffing</i> )

21:15.691 --> 21:17.901
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT MY BEDROOM.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.737
{\an5}Sam:
LOOK AT THAT
GARBAGE PILE!

21:20.821 --> 21:21.738
IT NEVER GETS TALLER.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.116
Otto:
WHERE IS THE GARBAGE GOING?

21:26.326 --> 21:27.536
All:
WHOA!

21:27.619 --> 21:31.039
{\an5}Reggie:
THE GARBAGE IS POURING
THROUGH THAT HOLE.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.166
{\an5}Sam:
AND IT RUNS RIGHT
INTO THAT CREEK!

21:34.334 --> 21:37.587
{\an5}Twister:
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THAT CREEK GOES?

21:37.671 --> 21:37.963
YOUR BEDROOM?

21:38.046 --> 21:39.715
NO WAY!

21:39.798 --> 21:40.716
IT PROBABLY GOES
RIGHT INTO THE OCEAN.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.051
All:
DUH!

21:43.135 --> 21:45.637
WE GET THE HOLE FIXED,
WE FIX THE PROBLEM.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.431
TWISTER!

21:47.514 --> 21:49.224
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

21:49.307 --> 21:50.767
(<i> giggles</i> )

21:59.109 --> 22:00.902
WHOO-HOO!

22:00.986 --> 22:02.070
YEAH!

22:02.154 --> 22:03.613
ALL RIGHT!

22:03.697 --> 22:05.907
WHOO-HOO!

22:05.991 --> 22:08.869
DAG! THAT WAS SUCH
AN EXCELLENT WAVE!

22:08.952 --> 22:11.580
100% GARBAGE-FREE, TOO!

22:11.663 --> 22:12.330
SORRY I VOLUNTEERED US

22:12.414 --> 22:13.832
FOR GARBAGE DUTY
WITH TICE.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.084
IT'S NOT THAT BAD

22:16.168 --> 22:17.419
NOW THAT THE HOLE IN THE WALL
IS FIXED.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.881
I DON'T MIND TAKING CARE
OF ROCKET BEACH.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.051
CAN, UH, WE CALL IT
SQUID BEACH SOMEDAY?

22:24.134 --> 22:26.136
<i>NO PROBLEMO,</i> SAMMY.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.429
YOU DID SAVE
THE DAY.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.598
{\an5}THAT WAS
PRETTY SMOOTH
DETECTIVE WORK--

22:29.681 --> 22:30.807
TRACING ALL
THE GARBAGE

22:30.891 --> 22:31.349
BACK TO THE DUMP.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.934
HEY, YOU GUYS.

22:33.018 --> 22:33.894
All:
WHAT?

22:33.977 --> 22:34.853
MY MOM SAID

22:34.936 --> 22:35.896
TO CLEAN UP MY ROOM

22:35.979 --> 22:36.938
BEFORE THE WEEKEND

22:37.022 --> 22:39.107
OR I'LL BE GROUNDED.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.192
All:
SO?

22:40.275 --> 22:42.402
WOULD YOU HELP ME
CLEAN IT UP?

22:43.570 --> 22:44.613
NEVER MIND.
