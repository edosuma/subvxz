00:03.132 --> 00:04.608
I hope you left us something.

00:06.927 --> 00:10.087
You will be here only
<i>when I tell you to be here.</i>

00:10.188 --> 00:11.372
We're done, Peter.

00:11.475 --> 00:12.693
Have a happy birthday.

00:12.787 --> 00:13.844
How old are you gonna be?

00:14.435 --> 00:15.618
Forty.

00:15.976 --> 00:18.002
So when you're forty,
how old will I be?

00:18.105 --> 00:19.460
You'll be dead.

00:19.913 --> 00:21.398
My boss made a call.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.230
You told Mayor Lindsay.

00:25.628 --> 00:28.982
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

<i>One and a half bathrooms.</i>

01:15.376 --> 01:17.777

<i>And at $28,000,</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:26.853
<i>I do believe that was</i>
<i>everything on your list.</i>

01:26.887 --> 01:29.489
It's a little farther east
than I wanted.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.458
In fact, it's about
as far east as you could go.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.093
You can see the highway
from the corner.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.461
You can see the river.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.063
And who needs Central Park

01:37.097 --> 01:39.799
when you can smell the ocean
and the Hungarian bakeries?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.051
Believe me, when they finish
the Second Avenue subway,

01:42.086 --> 01:44.837
this apartment
will quadruple in value.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.856
Oh, that's Barbara.

01:46.890 --> 01:48.224
You let me do the talking.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.145
Sorry I'm late.

01:53.163 --> 01:55.982
It's quite a hike
between First and York.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.950
It's got to be longer
than a normal block.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.585
I don't think so.

01:59.603 --> 02:01.637
We just got started.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.556
What do you think?

02:03.590 --> 02:06.058
I think no one's gonna catch
that doorman napping.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.327
I left your name.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.746
It's got a doorman.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.000
I was telling Peggy that an offer
is coming in at asking price.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.551
We'd have to beat it.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.403
So it's in your best interest
to be decisive

02:17.438 --> 02:19.021
and take this property
seriously.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.507
Well, okay,
but it's not my decision.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.977
Ginny, we are taking
this seriously.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.980
- What Abe means is--
- I'm more her trusted advisor.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.216
An interested party.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.418
Oh. I see.

02:32.436 --> 02:35.087
I, uh, misunderstood.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.590
I'm going to flush
that toilet again.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.995
She didn't know
I wasn't the buyer?

02:43.013 --> 02:44.964
So all this time
she was just being rude.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.333
Forget about her.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.468
Is it too far east?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.875
<i>Dinner.</i>

03:18.632 --> 03:20.950
<i>Bobby, Sally, let's go.</i>

03:28.959 --> 03:31.761
Look at you two.
Heading to the track?

03:34.047 --> 03:37.316
- Where are you going?
- DC, if Jonesy can find a cab.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.869
- Hope you're not in a rush.
- We have a car coming.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.004
6:30?
We should have done that.

03:42.039 --> 03:43.656
We're not going
to miss the train.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.157
Where are you going?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.928
They said DC.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.030
I mean, why are you going?

03:51.064 --> 03:54.834
Arnie was invited last minute
to give a keynote address.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.636
Did you have to tell him
it was last minute?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.138
I guess the point is somebody
more important fell out.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.057
It's a very
distinguished group.

04:01.091 --> 04:04.093
And you must have been
at least as important.

04:04.144 --> 04:07.613
Either way, it sounds like a good
excuse for a weekend in Washington.

04:07.648 --> 04:11.984
Yes. Come Monday morning,
it'll all be a dream.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.453
We should really go away.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.355
Looks like you're going
somewhere fun now.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.524
We are.
Megan's up for an award.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.760
Good for you.
Maybe tomorrow

04:20.793 --> 04:22.895
you'll be calling the producers
and asking for a raise.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.497
No, it's for advertising.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.098
The Ad Club of New York.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.901
- Paul Newman's coming.
- My goodness.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.670
You're really good
at everything.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.339
I was just a name on the team.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.808
There's the car.

04:35.826 --> 04:38.110
Well, break a leg.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.498
You, too.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.650
Oh, and, Don...

04:44.685 --> 04:45.985
we're going to DC.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.434
Hey, Pop, I--

05:03.236 --> 05:04.904
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.505
We were waiting for you.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.458
Look, miss, whatever he told
you we were interested in,

05:09.493 --> 05:12.345
- we're not.
- See how funny he is?

05:12.379 --> 05:15.314
Now, don't be rude.
This is Beverly Farber.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.083
She is Chaim Farber's daughter.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.320
I'm-- our dads,
they play chess together.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.172
Oh, uh...

05:23.206 --> 05:26.959
well, I...
it's nice to meet you.

05:26.977 --> 05:29.478
And now that you're home
from a busy day

05:29.529 --> 05:31.314
on Madison Avenue,

05:31.365 --> 05:33.633
I think you should go out
and have some dinner.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.168
What?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.538
Maybe we should
do this another time.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.341
Nonsense. There's no
time like the present.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.710
<i>You both should have some fun.</i>

05:44.745 --> 05:47.580
She's a schoolteacher.
She works all the time.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.949
I need to shave,
change my clothes, prepare.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.151
I mean, look at her.
She had a jump on me.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.136
I did.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.123
I was led to believe
that you knew about this.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.225
- Why did you tell her that?
- What's the difference?

06:00.243 --> 06:03.763
Look at her. I'm obviously
doing you a disservice.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.037
At least we're close
to the kitchen.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.639
It's not fair that all the
big agencies are up front.

06:13.657 --> 06:15.274
Closer to their trophies.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.992
But at least we're gonna
eat before them.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.514
Oh, I see Peggy back there.
We should go say hello.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.734
- I'm gonna wait for the group.
- You can't avoid her forever.

06:24.768 --> 06:26.068
I'm not.

06:26.103 --> 06:27.753
Tell her that no matter what,

06:27.788 --> 06:30.740
her laxative radio spot
is the sentimental favorite.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.367
<i>Hello, stranger.</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:43.986
I was hoping I'd see you.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.838
You know, other than on TV.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.441
- You don't watch.
- My mother and sister do.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.259
Really?
Do they hate me?

06:50.310 --> 06:51.877
Oh, just a minute.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.030
Megan, I want you
to meet Jim Cutler.

06:55.065 --> 06:56.532
He's the president of CGC.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.818
This is Megan Draper.
She's also a finalist.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.386
You must be Don's wife.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.987
When I started out,
they didn't make

07:02.022 --> 07:03.956
copywriters like you.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.474
Good luck.

07:08.779 --> 07:10.613
He's the head of accounts.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.898
He's like Roger
with bad breath.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.634
So he knows who you are.
It must be going well.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.353
If I survive tonight.

07:17.387 --> 07:19.872
CGC has no other finalists.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.707
Other-- they have none.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.510
I only came because
it seemed important to Don.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.646
I bet it is. We're the
only finalists from SCDP

07:27.681 --> 07:29.115
and neither of us
work there anymore.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.599
My work was for beans

07:30.634 --> 07:33.252
and they aren't even
a client anymore.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.104
I don't want
to talk about this.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.072
I want to talk
about my apartment.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.358
I made an offer today. I think
we're gonna be neighbors.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.927
- 84th and York.
- You're buying a place?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.663
Well, I paid off my debts
and helped out my mother

07:44.698 --> 07:48.033
and it turns out I still
have this tax problem.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.770
Don't apologize, Peggy.
You deserve it.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.304
Thank you.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.123
I should get back.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.309
I have to walk all the
way down to the front.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.895
You're terrible.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.917
<i>These are the worst
seats in the room.</i>

08:04.951 --> 08:08.003
- Don Draper, this is Randall Walsh.
- A pleasure to meet you.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.923
Randy here is in insurance and he wants
to come in for an official visit.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.926
Look, man, it's not like we're not
supposed to talk about business here.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.995
You want a presentation
right now?

08:16.029 --> 08:18.230
I don't think we'll interrupt the
proceedings, wherever they are.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.767
- I just thought you two should meet.
- We've already met.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.837
In fact, I'm pretty sure we've
had this meeting already, too.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.440
- And it went well.
- So where's our check?

08:28.475 --> 08:30.876
- He's solid.
- Okay, Randy.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.712
Go get back in your cage.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.566
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.989
Have no fear. They're
gonna fire off a cannon

08:44.024 --> 08:45.808
when the atrocities begin.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.510
Hello all.
You remember my wife Nan.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.346
Hello, everyone.
Good luck.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.966
I told you, Nan, Peggy's
the only one competing.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.035
Well, I didn't know
what else to say.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.873
So you probably figured out
by now that you didn't win.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.742
<i>- Ted. - But it doesn't matter,</i>
<i>because next year you will.</i>

09:03.777 --> 09:06.078
- Ted.
- And the year after. Just a second, honey.

09:07.914 --> 09:11.133
- Hey, man, sorry.
- Oh, I'm in your seat.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.801
Nan, you wanted
to see Paul Newman.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.320
Here he is.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.023
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.676
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we would like to welcome you</i>

09:20.710 --> 09:22.828
<i>to the Advertising Club</i>
<i>of New York's</i>

09:22.846 --> 09:26.131
<i>Fourth Annual ANDY Awards for
Excellence in Advertising.</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:38.410
So you like kids?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.647
Excuse me?

09:41.665 --> 09:43.349
I was asking because
you're a teacher,

09:43.383 --> 09:45.985
but I realize how that could
sound like something else.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.087
I'm a student teacher.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.122
I'm getting my master's
at Hunter.

09:51.408 --> 09:54.593
And, yes, I like kids.
Some kids.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.346
I just really can't believe he
brought you to the apartment.

09:57.380 --> 10:00.516
Stop saying that. You
don't know where I live.

10:00.550 --> 10:04.236
Well, it's kind of early
to find out, isn't it?

10:05.705 --> 10:07.773
Yes, I suppose it is.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.758
I don't know
what you're expecting.

10:09.793 --> 10:12.227
I mean, a couple of alter kockers
arrange a little meeting like this,

10:12.262 --> 10:14.396
it sounds very old world.
But it doesn't feel like it.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.082
I mean, you're a sexy girl
and you smell great.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.667
<i>You don't need to be set up.</i>

10:18.702 --> 10:20.352
And I sure as hell
didn't arrange this.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.120
I'm sure my father told you
what a Lothario I am,

10:22.138 --> 10:23.689
but I'm not.
I'm very anxious about it.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.791
I've never had sex,
not even once.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.662
Okay.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.436
What am I doing? I ordered
soup, I just said that.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.539
Michael...

10:40.573 --> 10:43.943
I'm just doing a favor
for my parents.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.578
Tonight will not be the night.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.616
And I saw a picture of you

10:50.650 --> 10:52.484
and, honestly,
you're very handsome.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.689
And I'm obviously very shallow.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.860
- I am?
- You must have heard that before.

11:03.313 --> 11:05.931
So...

11:05.949 --> 11:07.899
do you make a lot
of money teaching?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.635
No.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.771
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, Paul Newman.</i>

11:21.881 --> 11:24.717
<i>Good evening.
I am Paul Newman.</i>

11:24.751 --> 11:27.686
<i>The Advertising Club</i>
<i>of New York</i>

11:27.721 --> 11:31.023
has been kind enough to let me
say a few words here tonight.

11:31.057 --> 11:34.460
And I want to make one thing
clear from the very start.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.495
- I need binoculars.
- Shh.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.230
<i>I'm not here
because I'm an actor.</i>

11:38.264 --> 11:40.733
We invited him
because he's an actor.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.901
<i>I'm here because I've got six</i>
<i>kids and I'm worried about their future.</i>

11:42.936 --> 11:44.903
That's not an actor,
that's a speck.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.306
Gene McCarthy stood up
to Lyndon Johnson

11:47.340 --> 11:48.841
before Bobby Kennedy.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.310
<i>The others backed into</i>
<i>the election</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:52.845
<i>with their fingers to the wind,</i>

11:52.879 --> 11:54.613
<i>thinking of their own career</i>
<i>when the nation</i>

11:54.647 --> 11:57.149
<i>was in critical need of a hero.</i>

11:57.183 --> 11:59.184
I know Bobby Kennedy,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.186
but I'm supporting
Gene McCarthy

12:01.221 --> 12:03.155
<i>for President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

12:10.596 --> 12:12.898
<i>Mr. Newman, sir.</i>

12:12.932 --> 12:15.284
<i>Do you know, Mr. Newman, sir, that</i>
<i>Martin Luther King is dead?</i>

12:15.318 --> 12:19.204
<i>What have you to say?</i>

12:19.239 --> 12:21.073
No, that can't be.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.659
Who the hell said that?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.012
How awful.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.336
If I could have your
attention for a moment, please.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.288
<i>A moment of your attention.</i>

12:36.322 --> 12:38.490
<i>Not wanting to interrupt</i>
<i>the festivities,</i>

12:38.525 --> 12:41.894
we hoped to keep this news
until the end of the event.

12:41.928 --> 12:46.098
As it stands,
let's take 10 minutes

12:46.132 --> 12:48.500
<i>to talk out this terrible event</i>

12:48.535 --> 12:50.836
<i>and then resume the program.</i>

12:55.642 --> 12:57.276
What do you think happened?

12:57.310 --> 13:00.412
- What do you think?
- Come on.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.821
I guess Puerto Rico.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.822
But who has time?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.927
Your father says you've even
written some billboards.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.795
That must be exciting.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.264
You'd think so, but they
usually change it so much

13:19.282 --> 13:22.117
by the time they put it up there, it just
makes you angry every time you walk by.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.886
<i>...in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

13:23.920 --> 13:26.605
<i>after being shot in the face</i>
<i>by an unknown assailant</i>

13:26.639 --> 13:30.742
<i>on the balcony in front of a
downtown hotel a short while ago.</i>

13:30.777 --> 13:32.778
<i>Associated Press
says Assistant Police Chief</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:36.048
<i>Henry Lux of Memphis</i>
<i>confirmed Dr. King's death.</i>

13:36.082 --> 13:39.118
- <i>Reverend Dr. King, winner</i>
<i>of the Nobel Peace Prize...</i> - Oh, my God.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.320
- <i>...was 39 years old.</i>
- They had to do it.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.355
<i>He was in Memphis</i>
<i>to lead demonstrations</i>

13:43.373 --> 13:45.207
<i>in sympathy</i>
<i>with a prolonged strike</i>

13:45.241 --> 13:48.327
<i>by municipal garbage men,</i>
<i>most of them Negro.</i>

13:48.361 --> 13:50.395
<i>Police at last report</i>
<i>were still looking</i>

13:50.430 --> 13:52.664
<i>for a young white male</i>
<i>who was seen running</i>

13:52.699 --> 13:54.299
<i>from the scene of the shooting</i>

13:54.334 --> 13:56.835
<i>and reportedly dropped</i>
<i>the weapon in flight.</i>

13:56.870 --> 13:59.922
What are you doing in here?
Thought you'd be by the set.

13:59.956 --> 14:02.941
- She won't let us watch. - Because who
knows what they're going to show?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.228
You don't have to go.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.163
Betty, they're gonna
burn down the city.

14:10.967 --> 14:13.886
Everything's fine.
I have to go help the mayor.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.420
Please be careful.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.925
- And call me.
<i>- We repeat,</i>

14:19.959 --> 14:23.128
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King, America's
nonviolent civil rights...</i>

14:24.297 --> 14:26.598
What is taking so long?

14:26.633 --> 14:29.234
There are other people here
who need to make calls.

14:29.268 --> 14:32.638
They shot him in the face
in Memphis.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.390
Do they know who?

14:35.425 --> 14:37.559
Come on, they didn't catch
him yet, but you know who.

14:37.594 --> 14:41.847
Listen, Jimmy says they can get me a
photographer if I can get uptown.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.715
No, it's not a good idea.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.851
It's the "New York Times."

14:45.885 --> 14:49.087
- And what?
- It's a huge story.

14:53.743 --> 14:56.328
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Peggy, it's too late.

14:56.346 --> 14:58.513
I'm going to Harlem
in a tuxedo.

15:05.355 --> 15:07.105
I can't believe this.

15:07.139 --> 15:10.509
Abe just went uptown for work.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.744
I'm sick and I don't even know
how I'm gonna get home.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.097
We'll give you a ride.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.482
I'm tired of waiting for a phone.
I'm going home.

15:20.069 --> 15:23.288
What are we doing? They're
really still having the awards?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.789
What else are we gonna do?

15:36.599 --> 15:38.968
Look, I'm sure
it's hard to sleep.

15:39.002 --> 15:41.036
What is that?

15:43.156 --> 15:44.773
What are you doing?

15:44.808 --> 15:47.076
I didn't do it.
It peeled off.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.578
Why are you
destroying this house?

15:50.814 --> 15:52.481
You can't do this.

15:52.515 --> 15:54.183
I didn't do anything.

15:55.669 --> 15:57.285
I don't want
to talk about it now.

16:00.006 --> 16:01.674
Please just go to sleep.

16:05.362 --> 16:06.795
...the Civil Rights
Movement

16:06.830 --> 16:09.298
has been shot to death
in Memphis, Tennessee.

16:09.332 --> 16:11.400
Police have issued
an all-points bulletin...

16:11.434 --> 16:12.568
It's me.

16:12.602 --> 16:15.037
Oh.

16:15.071 --> 16:17.039
How are you?

16:19.125 --> 16:20.943
Not good.

16:20.977 --> 16:24.046
I don't know why
I'm so surprised.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.348
It's shameful.

16:26.383 --> 16:28.217
Listen, I...

16:30.053 --> 16:31.887
I don't want you
and Tammy to be alone.

16:31.921 --> 16:34.990
I could come out and sleep
there tonight if you want.

16:37.394 --> 16:39.895
No, I--

16:39.913 --> 16:41.897
we'll be fine.

16:43.566 --> 16:45.667
Well, I want to see Tammy.

16:45.701 --> 16:47.636
Is she all right?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.972
She doesn't know
what's going on.

16:50.006 --> 16:53.275
No, of course.

16:53.309 --> 16:55.160
I'll see you on Saturday.

16:55.211 --> 16:58.047
No, I'll just tell my parents

16:58.081 --> 16:59.781
you couldn't get out
of the city.

16:59.799 --> 17:03.185
Or I'll just cancel it
altogether.

17:03.219 --> 17:05.287
Trudy.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.989
What?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.260
I don't want you to be worried.

17:11.294 --> 17:13.662
Okay.

17:13.695 --> 17:15.798
<i>In a nationwide
television address,</i>

17:15.832 --> 17:18.434
<i>President Johnson</i>
<i>expressed the nation's shock.</i>

17:18.468 --> 17:20.202
Good night, Peter.

17:22.204 --> 17:23.906
Good night.

17:23.940 --> 17:26.275
<i>...of Dr. Martin Luther King.</i>

17:26.309 --> 17:28.510
<i>I ask every citizen</i>

17:28.545 --> 17:32.581
to reject the blind violence

17:32.615 --> 17:35.284
that has struck
Dr. King,

17:35.318 --> 17:39.021
who lived by nonviolence.

17:40.523 --> 17:42.324
Pop, wake up.

17:42.342 --> 17:44.526
What time is it?

17:44.561 --> 17:46.328
What are you doing
home so early?

17:46.362 --> 17:47.930
We cut it short.

17:47.964 --> 17:49.565
Martin Luther King got killed.

18:01.661 --> 18:03.812
<i>...try and cool things down.</i>

18:03.830 --> 18:05.447
In Boston,
according to police reports,

18:05.482 --> 18:07.816
a large crowd of Negroes
stoned six police cruisers

18:07.851 --> 18:11.086
near a Negro housing project
in the Roxbury section.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.922
<i>And there was a clash between</i>
<i>police and young Negroes</i>

18:13.957 --> 18:16.492
in Raleigh's main
downtown streets tonight.

18:16.526 --> 18:19.128
The latest report of trouble
comes from Washington, DC,

18:19.162 --> 18:21.130
<i>where stores along</i>
<i>a six-block area</i>

18:21.164 --> 18:23.799
<i>were broken into</i>
<i>late this evening.</i>

18:23.833 --> 18:25.934
- I don't agree with you, Papa.
- President Johnson went on nationwide

18:25.969 --> 18:28.570
television to express his shock
and personal grief at the tragedy.

18:28.605 --> 18:30.472
_

18:30.902 --> 18:33.482
_

18:34.100 --> 18:36.383
_

18:36.496 --> 18:37.979
...looking subdued and grim
at the thought

18:37.997 --> 18:39.982
of what this act
could mean in a country

18:40.016 --> 18:41.583
already taut
with racial tension.

18:41.618 --> 18:44.987
He said he applauded
the escalation of decay.

18:45.021 --> 18:48.056
So sick of that
Marxist bullshit.

18:48.091 --> 18:50.709
So far it's only
looting in Harlem,

18:50.743 --> 18:53.695
but a lot of places
are on fire.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.964
Well, it's raining.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.167
Do you think
your secretary is okay?

18:58.201 --> 19:01.837
Sylvia and Arnold are in DC.

19:01.871 --> 19:05.407
My father just hides
behind his intellect.

19:05.441 --> 19:07.926
He doesn't want
to feel any emotions.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.412
Let's watch inside.

19:10.446 --> 19:12.314
Maybe we can fall asleep.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.801
_

19:31.584 --> 19:34.553
Am I disturbing you?

19:34.604 --> 19:37.005
No. I'm not gonna judge you
if you want a drink.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.974
The man knew how to talk.

19:38.992 --> 19:41.443
I don't know why, but I
thought that would save him.

19:41.477 --> 19:43.512
I thought it would solve
the whole thing.

19:46.215 --> 19:49.318
Oh, I don't know if he
just wants to hold hands,

19:49.352 --> 19:51.436
but my insurance friend
from last night, he called.

19:51.487 --> 19:53.388
He wants to come in
at 3:00.

19:53.423 --> 19:55.540
I'll have Caroline remind you
since you're on your own.

19:55.592 --> 19:57.092
Could you get the door?

20:09.622 --> 20:12.341
Yes, actually, I'm trying
to reach Dr. Rosen.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.710
No, I'm not a patient.

20:14.744 --> 20:17.679
I just know that
he's in Washington and--

20:19.215 --> 20:21.750
well, I was concerned.

20:21.784 --> 20:23.485
I'm his neighbor.

20:26.072 --> 20:29.357
Oh, well, if you do reach him,

20:29.375 --> 20:31.360
just say...

20:32.629 --> 20:33.895
actually, no message.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.430
I'll try later.

20:45.608 --> 20:47.559
Oh, you're here.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.745
I'm sorry. There's no
reception out there.

20:49.779 --> 20:53.415
No, I just-- I didn't
expect you to come in.

20:53.449 --> 20:55.500
I kept calling
and no one answered.

20:55.551 --> 20:57.486
We went out
to my aunt's in Newark.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.887
Why would you do that?

20:58.921 --> 21:01.390
My mother wanted
to be with her sister.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.761
Abe said it could
have been a lot worse.

21:08.931 --> 21:10.866
I'm so sorry.

21:17.590 --> 21:19.641
I knew it was going to happen.

21:19.676 --> 21:22.577
He knew it was going to happen.

21:22.612 --> 21:25.380
But it's not gonna
stop anything.

21:29.385 --> 21:32.504
And these fools
running in the streets--

21:32.555 --> 21:34.923
it's exactly
what he didn't want.

21:34.957 --> 21:38.226
You should go home.

21:38.261 --> 21:40.228
In fact, none of us
should be working.

21:40.263 --> 21:41.563
Thank you.

21:51.841 --> 21:54.843
Is this really what happened?

21:54.877 --> 21:56.645
You didn't tell me anything.

21:56.679 --> 21:59.781
They got it right,
except that it was terrifying.

21:59.816 --> 22:02.284
Walking into that angry,
crazy crowd

22:02.318 --> 22:05.971
and Lindsay smiling like he was
going to a pancake breakfast.

22:06.005 --> 22:08.490
The only lives His Honor seemed
worried about protecting

22:08.524 --> 22:10.359
were the photographers'.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.928
- But it worked.
- I'll tell you what worked.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.430
Cutting deals with all
the militants last year.

22:15.465 --> 22:17.716
Well, I'm glad you were there.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.852
Me, too.
And I got to go back in.

22:20.903 --> 22:23.238
I want you to eat
something first.

22:26.242 --> 22:29.044
Clara.

22:29.078 --> 22:31.179
Have you seen Scarlett?

22:31.214 --> 22:32.481
Where's my girl?

22:34.150 --> 22:36.752
They must all be
watching TV somewhere.

22:36.786 --> 22:40.021
- Not in my office.
- I barely slept last night.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.524
I just thought working
might take my mind off things.

22:42.558 --> 22:44.926
Good luck. Been on the
phone all morning.

22:44.961 --> 22:47.028
They're worried about
last night, obviously,

22:47.063 --> 22:48.864
but they're worried about tonight,
they're worried about the weekend.

22:48.898 --> 22:50.732
- Who?
- The clients.

22:50.767 --> 22:52.818
They won't take make-goods.
They want money back.

22:52.869 --> 22:55.003
- That's disgusting.
- I don't know.

22:55.037 --> 22:57.105
It's enough
of this crap already.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.408
All these special broadcasts
preempting the prime-time schedule.

22:59.442 --> 23:01.843
"Bewitched," Merv, Dean Martin.

23:01.861 --> 23:03.445
You know they might
cancel the Stanley Cup?

23:03.479 --> 23:05.480
How dare you?

23:05.515 --> 23:07.616
This cannot be made good.

23:07.650 --> 23:09.351
It's shameful.

23:09.385 --> 23:11.419
It's a shameful, shameful day!

23:11.437 --> 23:13.254
Don't you scream at me.

23:13.272 --> 23:14.856
You don't think I'm upset
about that man being shot?

23:14.891 --> 23:16.892
Only because it's
costing you, you pig!

23:16.926 --> 23:18.560
It's costing all of us.

23:18.594 --> 23:20.545
And when's it gonna stop?
No one will be happy

23:20.580 --> 23:22.731
until they turn the most beautiful
city in the world into a shit hole.

23:22.765 --> 23:25.567
- Gentlemen, stop it. Stop it this minute.
- In a second, Bert.

23:25.601 --> 23:28.737
Did you know we were in the
presence of a bona fide racist?

23:28.771 --> 23:31.540
That's the latest thing, isn't it?
Everybody's a racist.

23:31.574 --> 23:34.609
Gentlemen!

23:34.644 --> 23:38.513
I urge you to shake hands in the
spirit of erasing these remarks.

23:42.852 --> 23:44.820
I'm sorry.

23:44.854 --> 23:47.739
I suppose that my comments
were inappropriate.

23:47.790 --> 23:50.225
I mistook this for a workday.

23:50.259 --> 23:52.344
Don't worry. I'm sure you
can make your money back

23:52.395 --> 23:53.979
on some Movie of the Week
next fall

23:54.013 --> 23:56.297
about the death of a great man.

23:56.315 --> 23:58.133
That is not what I meant.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.435
Let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

24:00.453 --> 24:03.138
That man had a wife
and four children.

24:12.982 --> 24:14.699
I'm sorry I'm late.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.117
Would you like coffee?

24:16.151 --> 24:17.752
Dawn, I'm just glad
you're okay.

24:17.787 --> 24:19.320
Joan was trying to reach you.

24:19.338 --> 24:21.323
The phone was out
for a little bit last night

24:21.357 --> 24:23.892
and, well, it took
some time to get here.

24:23.926 --> 24:25.894
I don't think
you should work today.

24:25.928 --> 24:28.280
I couldn't reach you. I assumed
you weren't coming in.

24:28.331 --> 24:30.365
My mother told me I should.

24:33.002 --> 24:35.303
Well, Mr. Cooper just
announced that out of respect

24:35.338 --> 24:37.038
we're going to close
the office early.

24:37.056 --> 24:39.441
- Oh.
- That's probably a good idea.

24:39.475 --> 24:42.994
- Mr. Sterling still wants to have the
3:00 meeting. - Are we closed or not?

24:43.029 --> 24:45.847
Stan and Ginsberg will also be joining.
Do you want to cancel it?

24:45.882 --> 24:48.917
- If you're gonna stay, I'll stay.
- No, you go.

24:48.951 --> 24:51.636
I'd really rather
be here today.

24:53.689 --> 24:55.256
Okay.

25:03.266 --> 25:05.050
We're all so sorry.

25:08.437 --> 25:10.038
Do you want anything?

25:11.490 --> 25:12.974
No.

25:22.892 --> 25:25.527
- Hello?
- Peggy Olson, please.

25:25.561 --> 25:27.562
- This is Peggy.
- Oh.

25:27.597 --> 25:30.498
I was about to send over your
offer and it occurred to me--

25:30.516 --> 25:33.518
Oh, my offer. I completely
forgot about that.

25:33.553 --> 25:36.004
- You haven't sent it?
- No, I haven't.

25:36.038 --> 25:38.540
Well, no one's gonna want
to look at that today.

25:38.574 --> 25:40.108
May I speak?

25:40.143 --> 25:42.494
I thought the same thing,
but then I realized

25:42.545 --> 25:44.246
there's trouble 10 blocks away.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.047
They're probably
on pins and needles.

25:46.082 --> 25:49.084
So am I. Do I want
to live up there?

25:49.118 --> 25:52.020
Get ahold of yourself.
The other buyer never came in.

25:52.054 --> 25:54.222
Why don't we come in
at 5,000 under asking

25:54.257 --> 25:55.874
and give them 24 hours
to respond?

25:55.908 --> 25:57.909
<i>We'll let the TV news</i>
<i>do the rest.</i>

25:57.960 --> 26:00.629
- I don't know.
- This is the only apartment for you.

26:00.663 --> 26:02.697
You don't want to be
kicking yourself next week.

26:02.732 --> 26:05.066
And, of course, I'll wait
until tomorrow to present.

26:07.236 --> 26:09.704
Good girl.

26:16.295 --> 26:17.963
Randall Walsh,
you remember Don.

26:18.014 --> 26:20.882
This is Stan Rizzo
and Michael Ginsberg.

26:28.591 --> 26:30.826
Randall, would you
like a drink?

26:30.860 --> 26:34.062
Never. I really don't
even want to talk.

26:34.096 --> 26:37.098
I was trying to communicate without
words, but it's not working.

26:37.133 --> 26:39.434
Randy, it never works.

26:39.452 --> 26:43.004
Randall has an idea and the ad
director won't take a chance.

26:43.039 --> 26:45.273
You're in the property
insurance business.

26:45.308 --> 26:48.043
I'll bet you're about
to get hit pretty hard.

26:48.077 --> 26:49.911
Forget about that.

26:49.946 --> 26:52.047
This is about
a no bullshit approach

26:52.081 --> 26:53.748
to why I got
into this business.

26:53.783 --> 26:56.084
People say they care.

26:56.118 --> 26:58.520
I really care.

27:03.493 --> 27:05.143
We're waiting for you, Randall.

27:05.194 --> 27:09.781
All I see when I close my eyes

27:09.815 --> 27:13.952
is our name
and a Molotov cocktail

27:13.986 --> 27:15.954
being lit with a match.

27:15.988 --> 27:18.406
And then a coupon
at the bottom.

27:19.809 --> 27:22.978
The ad sales guy
didn't like that?

27:23.012 --> 27:25.480
I know what it looks like--
fearmongering.

27:25.515 --> 27:27.516
But this is the opposite.

27:27.550 --> 27:29.885
This is a coded message
that came to me

27:29.919 --> 27:31.686
when I was visited
by the spirit

27:31.721 --> 27:34.289
of Dr. King last night.

27:34.323 --> 27:37.592
He said that I should question
the whole property thing, man.

27:39.295 --> 27:40.795
It makes you happy, right?

27:42.381 --> 27:45.233
No, I think it was

27:45.268 --> 27:48.103
his end will always
be in poor taste.

27:48.137 --> 27:50.438
'Cause you'd rather
not think about it.

27:50.473 --> 27:52.874
But there is a tear,
and in that tear

27:52.909 --> 27:55.477
are all the tears in the world,

27:55.511 --> 27:58.246
all the animals crying.

28:00.349 --> 28:02.584
You're right-- I don't
want to think about it.

28:02.618 --> 28:05.103
What Don's saying is
despite what we believe

28:05.137 --> 28:06.805
to be good intentions,

28:06.856 --> 28:09.057
you're allowing
the emotions of the day,

28:09.091 --> 28:12.260
and whatever else you got in your
system, to influence your judgment.

28:12.295 --> 28:14.529
Are you forgetting
what Tecumseh said?

28:16.532 --> 28:19.734
Heya howa howa hoya.

28:19.769 --> 28:23.471
- Heya howa howa.
- I had forgotten that.

28:23.506 --> 28:25.156
We'll think about it.

28:28.995 --> 28:30.996
This is an opportunity.

28:31.047 --> 28:33.782
The heavens
are telling us to change.

28:37.069 --> 28:39.554
You talked
to Dr. King's ghost?

28:39.572 --> 28:41.489
Make sure Randy
doesn't get lost.

28:45.461 --> 28:47.912
- I had to wait around for that?
- I don't know.

28:47.964 --> 28:50.915
He was very emotional.
He talked me off a roof once.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.500
I kind of owed him.
You want a drink?

28:52.535 --> 28:54.135
I just want to go home.

28:54.169 --> 28:56.187
Someone's gonna do
that idea, you know.

28:56.222 --> 28:57.889
Not us.

29:01.861 --> 29:03.345
<i>Three deaths have been reported</i>

29:03.379 --> 29:05.380
<i>in the Washington</i>
<i>rioting so far.</i>

29:05.414 --> 29:08.500
<i>There are no details yet on the
circumstances surrounding them.</i>

29:08.551 --> 29:11.620
<i>More than 350 persons have
been treated for injuries.</i>

29:11.654 --> 29:14.489
<i>Among them, several policemen and firemen.</i>

29:14.523 --> 29:16.858
<i>Firefighting was hampered</i>
<i>if for no other reason</i>

29:16.892 --> 29:19.094
<i>by the sheer volume</i>
<i>of the alarms.</i>

29:19.128 --> 29:22.364
<i>But still, some persons</i>
<i>were injured and...</i>

29:22.398 --> 29:25.700
<i>It's Betty. You're supposed</i>
<i>to pick up the kids.</i>

29:25.734 --> 29:28.003
Oh, shit.

29:31.306 --> 29:33.608
Got it.
Hello.

29:33.643 --> 29:35.110
I knew you would forget.

29:35.144 --> 29:37.278
You really want them down here?

29:37.313 --> 29:40.482
I know you don't. You get out of
every opportunity to see them.

29:40.516 --> 29:42.517
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>how strange they're acting.</i>

29:42.551 --> 29:44.269
The news is very upsetting.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.887
I'm sure it has nothing
to do with the fact

29:45.905 --> 29:47.489
that their father
forgot about them.

29:47.523 --> 29:49.324
You want me to come up
there and get them,

29:49.358 --> 29:51.493
drive right through
everything after dark?

29:51.527 --> 29:53.294
Well, of course,
Henry thinks it's fine,

29:53.329 --> 29:55.296
but he's not as concerned
about their safety as you are.

29:55.331 --> 29:57.165
Well, Henry would know.

29:57.199 --> 29:59.701
I guarantee you'd go
to Canada on your knees

29:59.735 --> 30:01.436
to pick up your girlfriend.

30:02.421 --> 30:04.089
I don't believe this.

30:05.574 --> 30:07.575
I'm going to get the kids.

30:07.593 --> 30:10.311
<i>...relatively little interference
during the afternoon.</i>

30:11.564 --> 30:13.598
Really?

30:13.649 --> 30:15.583
They called in the troops
in Washington,

30:15.618 --> 30:18.536
but Henry says we're fine here.

30:18.571 --> 30:20.989
She's a piece of work.

30:21.023 --> 30:23.808
<i>Looting spread to the downtown</i>
<i>shopping section of the city</i>

30:23.843 --> 30:26.794
<i>and as darkness fell,</i>
<i>arrests increased.</i>

30:41.377 --> 30:44.879
You finished with that?
You can walk me to work.

30:44.914 --> 30:47.315
I'm already at work.

30:47.349 --> 30:50.085
Since when are you
going in on Saturday?

30:50.119 --> 30:52.987
Since I don't want to be
in front of the TV set.

30:55.324 --> 30:56.624
Good as new.

30:56.642 --> 30:58.643
This?

30:58.677 --> 31:00.662
This is a mess.

31:00.696 --> 31:04.232
You can't sew, you can't
cook, you can't clean.

31:04.266 --> 31:07.568
You don't think there's a reason
you have all these flaws?

31:07.586 --> 31:09.771
You need a girl.

31:09.805 --> 31:11.706
But maybe you don't like 'em.

31:11.741 --> 31:13.675
I like girls, Dad.

31:13.709 --> 31:16.244
If that was true, you'd be
in bed with her right now.

31:16.278 --> 31:18.513
I don't think
anybody's in the mood.

31:18.531 --> 31:20.398
It's quite the opposite.

31:20.449 --> 31:22.350
Now's the time
when a man and a woman

31:22.384 --> 31:24.285
need to be together the most.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.172
In a catastrophe.

31:27.223 --> 31:30.125
In the flood, the animals
went two by two.

31:30.159 --> 31:32.193
You, you're gonna get on
the ark with your father.

31:32.228 --> 31:34.595
I can find my own girls, okay?

31:34.613 --> 31:36.448
Okay.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.918
I'll bring you a sandwich.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.342
I'm glad you finally slept.

32:14.377 --> 32:16.311
What's going on?

32:16.345 --> 32:18.146
We're going to a vigil
in the park.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.818
- You're not supposed to be watching TV.
- I'm not.

32:23.853 --> 32:25.754
You are, and Mom
said you can't.

32:25.788 --> 32:28.590
Sally, stop it.

32:28.624 --> 32:30.592
Troy and Bridget called.
They're gonna meet us there.

32:30.626 --> 32:32.193
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

32:32.228 --> 32:35.113
I don't feel well.

32:37.466 --> 32:40.068
You go on ahead.
I'll watch him.

32:42.154 --> 32:43.772
Come on.

32:45.575 --> 32:48.777
Look, I just can't sit around
in the apartment anymore.

32:48.811 --> 32:50.412
I feel like
I have to do something.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.631
I understand.

32:52.665 --> 32:54.633
I knew you wouldn't go.

33:06.996 --> 33:08.396
You want some aspirin?

33:12.768 --> 33:15.203
Hey.
Turn it off.

33:19.075 --> 33:21.276
Tell me exactly
what your mother said.

33:21.310 --> 33:24.279
I'm not allowed
to watch TV for a week.

33:25.848 --> 33:28.917
<i>Man has no understanding.</i>

33:28.951 --> 33:32.887
He can be taught a few
simple tricks, nothing more.

33:32.922 --> 33:35.190
<i>I'm afraid I must disagree.</i>

33:35.224 --> 33:36.825
<i>According to</i>
<i>my experiments--</i>

33:36.859 --> 33:40.495
Dr. Zira,
I must caution you.

33:42.264 --> 33:44.566
I guess your stomach
is feeling better.

33:47.036 --> 33:48.970
Why are you being punished?

33:49.005 --> 33:50.839
I don't know.

33:50.873 --> 33:52.574
Come on.

33:52.608 --> 33:54.909
Because the wallpaper
didn't line up.

33:54.944 --> 33:57.212
<i>...the simian nature</i>
<i>from a study of man</i>

33:57.246 --> 33:59.280
is sheer nonsense,

33:59.315 --> 34:01.583
because man is a nuisance.

34:01.617 --> 34:05.720
<i>He eats up his food supplies</i>
<i>in the forest...</i>

34:05.755 --> 34:08.840
You maniacs!

34:08.891 --> 34:11.309
You blew it up!

34:11.344 --> 34:14.562
Oh, damn you!

34:14.597 --> 34:19.234
God damn you all to hell!

34:44.493 --> 34:46.428
The humans blew up New York?

34:46.462 --> 34:48.396
All of America.

34:48.431 --> 34:51.248
So he came back to here?

34:51.300 --> 34:52.699
In the future.

34:55.036 --> 34:57.172
Jesus.

35:00.042 --> 35:01.809
You want to see it again?

35:01.827 --> 35:03.411
Can we?

35:12.271 --> 35:15.123
I need another half hour.

35:15.157 --> 35:17.391
Oh, yeah.
Just a minute.

35:18.994 --> 35:21.596
It's for you.
It's the real estate agent.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.768
- Hello, Ginny.
- Well, we didn't get it.

35:27.770 --> 35:29.504
Wh-- what happened?

35:29.538 --> 35:31.206
Someone came in
a little bit higher.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.041
But you know what?
It wasn't meant to be.

35:33.075 --> 35:35.160
How much higher?

35:35.211 --> 35:37.796
It was still under asking, Peggy.
It wasn't meant to be.

35:37.830 --> 35:40.548
There's no other way to think about it.
Try, try again.

35:48.057 --> 35:50.525
Someone else got the apartment.

35:50.559 --> 35:52.377
What are you gonna do?

35:56.398 --> 35:59.100
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

35:59.135 --> 36:01.002
That you give a damn.

36:01.036 --> 36:03.404
Peggy, this is
an emotional story.

36:03.438 --> 36:06.074
Stop being such a martyr. You're
having the time of your life.

36:06.108 --> 36:08.977
- Why are you so mad?
- Because I'm alone in this.

36:10.095 --> 36:11.546
That's not cool.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.681
I don't mean financially.

36:13.716 --> 36:16.251
I mean, don't you care
where we live?

36:16.285 --> 36:18.820
Look, I don't feel right
expressing an opinion.

36:18.854 --> 36:20.789
Now is your chance.

36:20.823 --> 36:22.791
I don't want to live
on the Upper East Side.

36:22.825 --> 36:25.827
Fine. Why?

36:25.861 --> 36:27.428
I don't know.

36:27.463 --> 36:29.230
I saw us raising
our kids in a place

36:29.265 --> 36:30.765
with more different
kinds of people.

36:33.319 --> 36:36.404
This photographer
trailing me the other night,

36:36.438 --> 36:38.673
he lives in the West 80s.

36:38.707 --> 36:40.074
Isn't it dangerous?

36:40.109 --> 36:41.576
No, it's more rundown.

36:41.610 --> 36:43.611
But that's why it's so cheap.

36:43.646 --> 36:46.181
Get some lumber, a coat of paint--
people are doing it.

37:05.684 --> 37:08.152
I didn't know
you felt that way.

37:09.638 --> 37:11.339
About the Upper East Side.

37:13.042 --> 37:14.492
I do.

37:16.295 --> 37:18.663
I'm sorry.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.748
I just felt it wasn't my money.

37:20.783 --> 37:22.467
How much of a say do I have?

37:24.803 --> 37:27.755
You're in my life.

37:27.773 --> 37:29.791
You're a part of my life.

37:33.245 --> 37:35.246
Peggy, I've got to finish this.

38:04.059 --> 38:07.028
- Did you see this movie?
- Not yet.

38:08.998 --> 38:10.999
Do you get to see it for free?

38:11.033 --> 38:13.201
- I do.
- It's really good.

38:13.235 --> 38:16.204
- We're seeing it again.
- You enjoy yourself.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.125
Everybody likes to go to the
movies when they're sad.

38:48.036 --> 38:51.305
I was looking for you.
You left the TV on.

38:51.323 --> 38:53.524
I don't feel right
turning it off,

38:53.575 --> 38:56.327
but I don't want to watch it.

38:56.362 --> 38:58.496
He doesn't even want
me to come in.

38:58.530 --> 38:59.814
Everything has settled down.

38:59.848 --> 39:01.532
For the time being.

39:01.583 --> 39:04.819
No, I think this
is the end of it.

39:06.154 --> 39:08.156
Good.

39:08.190 --> 39:10.591
Betty, I hope you know you'll
never have to worry about money.

39:10.626 --> 39:13.027
Why would you bring that up?

39:13.062 --> 39:15.029
Nothing.

39:15.064 --> 39:16.731
I just keep asking myself,

39:16.765 --> 39:18.900
- "What am I doing?"
- About what?

39:18.934 --> 39:22.170
I keep thinking about
walking through Harlem,

39:22.204 --> 39:25.807
Lindsay a few paces ahead,
grinning like he always does,

39:25.841 --> 39:28.142
the rest of us
following behind.

39:28.177 --> 39:31.079
- Wasn't that frightening?
- It was exhilarating.

39:31.113 --> 39:33.481
But what was the cost
of avoiding that riot?

39:33.515 --> 39:36.517
Police corruption,
disrespect for authority,

39:36.535 --> 39:38.369
negotiating with hoodlums.

39:38.404 --> 39:40.204
You can't say that
to the mayor.

39:40.239 --> 39:41.723
He's never been more popular.

39:41.757 --> 39:44.325
It's just, Betty,

39:44.343 --> 39:46.678
I keep thinking I would
do it differently.

39:48.464 --> 39:50.715
I want to do it differently.

39:50.766 --> 39:53.818
And, well, they approached me

39:53.852 --> 39:56.187
like they always do
when somebody dies

39:56.238 --> 39:58.740
and they offered me a seat
in the state senate.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.528
Do you want to run?

40:03.579 --> 40:06.381
Run?
It's a Republican seat.

40:06.415 --> 40:08.783
It's basically unopposed.

40:08.801 --> 40:11.652
- You'd have to quit the mayor's office.
- He'll understand.

40:11.687 --> 40:14.255
You think I'm the first guy
sick of being in a flank?

40:14.289 --> 40:17.625
I feel like I've been asking you
to do this since I met you.

40:17.643 --> 40:19.510
Well, I finally heard you.

40:19.561 --> 40:22.330
It's a stepping stone
to state attorney general.

40:22.364 --> 40:24.766
- And--
- And who knows what else?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.434
Easy, partner.

40:26.468 --> 40:28.603
This is what
I've wanted for you.

40:28.637 --> 40:30.204
Us.

40:30.239 --> 40:32.540
I can't wait
for people to meet you.

40:32.574 --> 40:36.077
You know?
Really meet you.

40:55.268 --> 40:57.135
Everyone's in bed.

40:57.153 --> 40:59.604
Gene finally
climbed in with Sally.

41:04.277 --> 41:06.361
I felt better, but now I don't.

41:08.448 --> 41:12.250
- Why?
- Because who knows what you're feeling?

41:12.285 --> 41:13.985
I didn't know
what to say to her

41:14.003 --> 41:15.620
except, "I'd tell you
to ask your father,

41:15.654 --> 41:17.789
but he's at the movies."

41:17.823 --> 41:20.008
I should have said,
"He's just drunk."

41:20.043 --> 41:22.377
You're better with them.

41:24.663 --> 41:26.765
You don't understand.

41:26.799 --> 41:29.334
I do.

41:29.352 --> 41:31.836
You don't have Marx,
you've got a bottle.

41:35.525 --> 41:37.526
Is this what you really
want to be to them

41:37.560 --> 41:39.611
when they need you?

41:39.645 --> 41:41.530
No.

41:47.820 --> 41:50.906
I don't think I ever wanted to
be the man who loves children.

41:55.828 --> 41:58.363
But from the moment
they're born...

42:00.083 --> 42:02.801
that baby comes out

42:02.835 --> 42:05.537
and you act proud and excited

42:05.555 --> 42:09.341
and hand out cigars...

42:13.379 --> 42:15.514
but you don't feel anything.

42:19.569 --> 42:23.572
Especially if you had
a difficult childhood.

42:27.743 --> 42:31.613
You want to love them,
but you don't.

42:33.232 --> 42:35.250
And the fact that you're...

42:36.902 --> 42:40.038
faking that feeling

42:40.072 --> 42:41.706
makes you wonder

42:41.740 --> 42:44.209
if your own father
had the same problem.

42:51.017 --> 42:52.801
Then one day they get older...

42:56.088 --> 42:58.557
and you see them
do something...

43:01.644 --> 43:03.761
and you feel...

43:05.815 --> 43:08.450
that feeling

43:08.484 --> 43:10.935
that you were
pretending to have.

43:17.577 --> 43:20.462
And it feels like your
heart is going to explode.

43:50.809 --> 43:53.144
That was faster
than I expected.

43:55.164 --> 43:56.915
Are the things calmer out there?

44:02.421 --> 44:04.322
Well, then...

44:04.340 --> 44:06.424
have a good night.

45:02.715 --> 45:05.100
Hey.

45:05.151 --> 45:08.153
- You need to go to sleep.
- I can't.

45:20.266 --> 45:22.233
So why can't you sleep?

45:24.303 --> 45:26.104
I'm scared.

45:26.138 --> 45:28.807
Don't make me sorry for
taking you to the movies.

45:28.841 --> 45:30.609
No.

45:30.643 --> 45:32.477
I just keep thinking...

45:34.914 --> 45:37.749
what if somebody shoots Henry?

45:45.825 --> 45:47.726
No one's gonna do that.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.629
- But they could.
- But they won't.

45:51.931 --> 45:53.965
Henry's not that important.

45:59.772 --> 46:01.790
Go to sleep.
