NICHOLAS: Bada-bing bada-boom!
Let's go, baby!

00:07.608 --> 00:08.941
<i>NARRATOR: As the
season gets rolling...</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.409
TJ: Ha-ha, woo!

00:10.878 --> 00:12.144
TIM: Reel, come on!
Don't be "woo" ing!

00:12.212 --> 00:13.212
TJ: I am reeling.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.480
<i>NARRATOR: And the
market heats up...</i>

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
DAVE: Let's go on a tear now.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.483
TYLER: Let's smoke these dudes.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.351
<i>NARRATOR: Captains are
on the hunt for blue gold.</i>

00:19.420 --> 00:21.620
PAUL: We're gonna
take a ride to Chatham.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.021
DAVE: We're leaving right now.

00:23.024 --> 00:23.955
PAUL: We're out of here.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.490
MARCIANO: We're off
on our secret spot.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.492
JOE: No peeking.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.226
<i>NARRATOR: Right now,
it's anyone's game...</i>

00:28.229 --> 00:29.961
MARCIANO: The game
is tightening up.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.430
It's crucial we get hot again.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.498
DAVE: We left the place
where he got them.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.534
<i>NARRATOR: But the early
leaders on Pinwheel...</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:37.903
MARISSA: What's going on? TYLER:
The throttles won't work. MARISSA: Uh-oh.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.971
TYLER: We have no throttles,
no shifters.

00:39.974 --> 00:41.306
SPURGE: Oh, boy.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.641
<i>NARRATOR: Have control issues.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:43.575
MARISSA: Tyler! Tyler!

00:43.644 --> 00:44.776
TYLER: Got no throttles.
Can't drive!

00:44.779 --> 00:46.178
MARISSA: Tyler!

00:46.180 --> 00:48.047
<i>NARRATOR: While the rest of
the fleet deal with chaotic hook-ups.</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:49.982
DAVE: Oh!
Do not let it go!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.516
GEORDIE: I'm trying.
DAVE: Unbelievable.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.985
<i>NARRATOR: Who's got
the right moves?</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:54.920
NICHOLAS: Those guys
are gonna be heated.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.121
TIM: Bob, get out of the way.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.522
<i>TJ (over radio): Bob,
he's coming straight at you.</i>

00:57.525 --> 00:58.723
<i>NARRATOR: In the search...</i>

00:58.726 --> 01:00.492
TYLER: We got a dart in him,
but it ain't over yet, baby!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.861
<i>NARRATOR: For Wicked Tuna.</i>

01:02.863 --> 01:05.697
MARCIANO: Change our bait.
Change our fate.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.067
<i>NARRATOR: The brother
and sister team on Pinwheel</i>

01:09.070 --> 01:10.735
<i>command first place,</i>

01:10.738 --> 01:13.739
<i>while Fat Tuna follows
close behind in second,</i>

01:14.875 --> 01:17.142
<i>and Moonshine rounds
out the top three.</i>

01:17.945 --> 01:19.978
<i>Hard Merch and
Time Flies are on the board,</i>

01:20.881 --> 01:22.547
<i>and Dot Com, Hot Tuna,</i>

01:22.550 --> 01:25.651
<i>and Wicked Pissah have yet
to catch their first bluefin.</i>

01:31.558 --> 01:33.358
TYLER: All right,
let's get going here.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.027
We gotta get back out
there to the meat.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.296
MARISSA: Come on, Tyler.
Maintain this lead.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.498
TYLER: We're going back up
to Maine because that's where

01:39.500 --> 01:40.699
we're gonna catch the
good quality fish.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.034
Fish prices are back,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.368
so we got to capitalize on it.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.370
We got a 90 incher
up there and I plan on

01:45.439 --> 01:46.638
getting another one.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.974
Right now,
momentum is on our side.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.710
We're exhausted already,
but this is no time to stop.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.779
We're in the lead and
we need to do whatever it takes

01:53.847 --> 01:55.113
to stay there.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.516
MARISSA: Being a two-person
crew, it's really challenging.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.784
Tyler and I, we haven't
gotten a lot of sleep.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.854
Having that extra guy
on board would definitely

02:01.922 --> 02:03.255
help out, but.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.323
TYLER: I have so much more
on my plate than so many

02:05.326 --> 02:07.392
of the other captains,
it's not even funny.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.529
MARISSA: This is tuna season,
we got to get the job done.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.599
We can sleep when
the tuna season's closed.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.400
TYLER: We can get up there,
get a good spot,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.736
hopefully catch another fish.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.604
Come on!

02:19.806 --> 02:21.473
MARISSA: We got this.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.878
BOB: This year we're
kinda going after bigger,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.814
higher quality fish and
you gotta travel to do that.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.450
We got a nice big one
down here in Chatham.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.019
We're going over 70 miles.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.755
It costs us about 500
bucks to come down here.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.357
And spending that much on fuel,

02:38.425 --> 02:41.493
you put yourself right in the
red and this may dry up down

02:41.495 --> 02:44.429
here in Chatham and we don't
have to make the long steam,

02:44.498 --> 02:46.765
but for now, it's worth it.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.367
And when it's not,
you make a change.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.169
But for now, we're gonna
stick around here and

02:51.172 --> 02:53.172
we're just grinding.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.774
Bluefin tuna come here to
feed because of the bait fish.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.043
You've got herring,
you've got mackerel,

02:58.045 --> 03:00.445
all kinds of bottom bait fish.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.182
Last year was a strange
year for everyone.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.984
We had closed days,
we had buyer shutdowns,

03:05.986 --> 03:08.053
we had very weak markets.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.122
We couldn't get in the
rhythm because we couldn't

03:10.190 --> 03:11.189
fish every day.

03:11.192 --> 03:15.260
This year we can and we
are excited to do that.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.734
BOB: We saw one...

03:22.736 --> 03:25.070
<i>BOB (over radio): In that
last place we set up to drift.</i>

03:25.138 --> 03:28.273
TJ: I just don't feel confident
without these whales here.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.642
BOB: It's all right.
We're gonna get 'em here.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.746
TJ: Bob Cook liked
this spot, I guess.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.882
One is ready for the
high bait over there.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.685
It's a horrible feeling
right now knowing that we

03:39.753 --> 03:42.020
haven't landed our
first fish of the season.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.289
We can fish seven days
a week but we can only catch

03:44.291 --> 03:45.958
one bluefin per day.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.293
So, everyday we're not catching
we're losing money to expenses,

03:48.962 --> 03:50.929
wasting time and missing
opportunities for paychecks.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.499
Good quality tuna will
get high prices from buyers.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.169
We just got to find them or it
will be very difficult to get ahead.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.905
TIM: Hopefully the rod bends
and we can stay right where we are.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.641
This fog is not helping
because we can't find the

04:02.709 --> 04:05.978
whales and stuff but it
could be worse, you know?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.852
(beeping)

04:13.920 --> 04:15.854
MIKE: I think you're
marking one at like 30 feet.

04:16.390 --> 04:22.060
(beeping)

04:25.466 --> 04:26.798
(reel unspooling rapidly)

04:26.800 --> 04:28.533
TIM: Oh. We're on! We're on!
Reel, reel, reel!

04:28.535 --> 04:29.801
TJ: Woo!

04:29.803 --> 04:31.069
TIM: Reel, come on!
Don't be "woo" ing!

04:31.071 --> 04:33.138
TJ: I am reeling.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.209
Reel, come on, come on.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.277
TIM: There we go.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.746
(overlapping chatter)

04:42.082 --> 04:43.081
TJ: Went right off.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.816
<i>TJ (over radio):
Mackerel 50 feet. No wait.</i>

04:44.885 --> 04:46.285
BOB: Nice, buddy okay.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.962
TJ: Definitely a tuna.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.498
TIM: He's not ready
to surrender just yet.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.900
He just was way
out on the surface.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.085
Tug of war, man.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.413
TJ: Coming right at
you all over the top.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.153
TIM: Come on, Bob.
Get out of the way.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.192
TIM: Come on, Bob.
Get out of the way.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.202
TIM: He's still running.
TJ: Tough fish, man.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.203
Just can't get
him under control.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.471
He wants to go
right towards Bob.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.406
Bob's like a tuna
magnet over there,

05:41.608 --> 05:43.408
except it's our tuna, not his.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.545
You got him still?

05:46.613 --> 05:48.079
TIM: Yeah.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.414
TJ: This fish is just
all over the surface.

05:49.416 --> 05:50.615
He don't want to settle down.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.417
You know, we just gotta get
him to surrender to the flow.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.219
He just doesn't want to stay
down in the water column.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.353
The only way we're gonna
get this fish is if we

05:55.356 --> 05:57.956
get him down in a good
pattern and tire him out.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.691
Right now, he's still
got plenty of energy.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.362
Want me to yank on
him for a little bit?

06:03.430 --> 06:06.698
TIM: You want to pull on him?
TJ: A little bump back now.

06:08.152 --> 06:10.535
Bump back.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.242
Wow, wow, wow!

06:18.445 --> 06:21.046
Making us work for it.
We're gonna get him.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.046
(tension snap)

06:22.049 --> 06:23.448
Oh, gone!

06:23.517 --> 06:25.283
TIM: Chafed him off.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.756
TJ: Swivel on the (bleep) tip.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.396
(bleep) chafed him off.

06:37.464 --> 06:38.764
Swivel on the tip right there.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.332
<i>TJ (over radio): That sucked.</i>

06:41.335 --> 06:44.302
<i>I mean he was right there.
Yeah, it's chafed good, man.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:47.939
TJ: Big curl.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.541
<i>BOB (over radio):
Sorry about that, bro.</i>

06:49.609 --> 06:50.809
BOB: Get 'em back out.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.011
TIM: That's one happy
tuna right there.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.345
He gets to see another day.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.547
TJ: It sucks, man.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.016
We'll just get back upon the
drift and we're not going back

06:58.084 --> 06:59.484
to Gloucester just yet.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.626
MARCIANO: Why can't
we get bit today?

07:07.694 --> 07:09.227
Well, here we are.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.229
We're started right where
we got our last fish.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.164
If you wanna call
it a secret spot.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.968
I know if we sit tight eventually
the rod is gonna bend.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.972
There's a huge demand for
bluefin tuna in this country.

07:20.974 --> 07:24.776
And good prices are gonna
mean a great season for us.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.379
If you can keep putting
'em on the screen eventually

07:28.382 --> 07:29.514
you'll put them on the hook.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.583
That's what we're looking for.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.319
You guys are supposed to
tell me to be patient.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.555
I don't like being patient.

07:40.194 --> 07:41.993
DAVE: We still got to
get our first fish.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.195
Hopefully we made
the right move.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.530
But there's definitely a lot
more fish here than there is

07:45.532 --> 07:47.466
where we were on the bank.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.134
We had a rough start
fishing Stellwagen Bank and

07:49.202 --> 07:51.736
we still don't have
our first bluefin.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.273
I usually use my logbook with
a history of where we have and

07:55.342 --> 07:57.175
have not caught in the past.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.677
But in this case,

07:58.745 --> 08:01.263
I wanna fish where
we heard boats are catching

08:01.415 --> 08:03.681
big bluefin and
that's down in Cape Cod.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.618
We're fishing baits up
high just subsurface.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.955
Now we're gonna fish the
down rod just off the bottom.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.290
I hope that we came down here
and we made the right move.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.025
Time is gonna tell.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.962
SANDRO: Fingers crossed and,
uh, hopefully they come piling through.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.407
BOB: We got to try to get 'em.
MANNY: There's a whale up there.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.710
BOB: We're gonna
get the kite up here.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.513
We've had a lot of success
with this in the past.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.250
This one basically suspends
the bait on the surface.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.851
They're feeding
on surface baits,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.719
we know this kite
will be effective,

08:41.722 --> 08:43.788
so we're gonna try to get
this up in the air and get

08:43.790 --> 08:45.456
a bait out right away.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.527
JOHN: There seems to be
a lot of surface activity here,

08:48.929 --> 08:52.130
some mackerel are pushing the sand
eels to the surface which, you know,

08:52.132 --> 08:54.132
the tuna chase
the mackerel feeding on

08:54.200 --> 08:55.199
the sand eel.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.801
So, we're gonna put
a surface bait out,

08:56.870 --> 08:58.470
probably at like 50 feet.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.804
Another one on the kite,

08:59.806 --> 09:01.539
which is actually
on the surface.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.742
And then, we usually always
have at least one down bait.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.944
So, we'll probably put
one down at about 150 feet.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.746
We're in about 250
feet right now,

09:08.749 --> 09:11.215
so we kinda cover that
whole water column.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.818
So, if anything is
coming through deep,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.553
we'll have down as well.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.089
BOB: I still believe in
Chatham because we're starting

09:18.158 --> 09:20.358
to see more signs of life.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.028
I'm going with my gut
feeling to stay right here.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.430
We got a big tuna here
on our last trip that gave

09:25.498 --> 09:27.032
us a great start.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.701
We need another one just
like that to get ahead early

09:29.703 --> 09:32.003
and stay in the game.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.914
(beeping)

09:42.983 --> 09:47.519
That's him.
Come on, baby!

09:48.521 --> 09:49.854
(beeping)

09:49.923 --> 09:51.790
(reel clicking)

09:51.858 --> 09:52.991
(reel unspooling rapidly)

09:52.993 --> 09:56.127
MANNY: Oh, oh. There you go!

09:56.730 --> 09:59.631
(bleep) dude!
You (bleep) called it.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.734
BOB: Woo! Hell yeah!

10:03.003 --> 10:05.069
MANNY: Let's go, boys.

10:05.072 --> 10:08.406
Hooked up! Here we go!
Fat Tuna's on the meat!

10:12.079 --> 10:13.945
JOHN: We're waiting for that
outside floater to go and

10:14.014 --> 10:16.314
this down rod ended up
getting a bite.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.222
BOB: This is the most
critical point right here.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.024
We gotta be very
careful here with what we do.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.459
We gotta get it.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.632
BOB: Well, he's definitely in
a circle going one way here.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.166
But it's a very wide circle.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.502
We wanna tighten that up so
we can just lift his head and

10:37.504 --> 10:39.637
do short little pinwheels up.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.573
These are just big wide ones.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.908
We have to keep moving the
boat and that never helps.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.112
We try to stay as
controlled as possible.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.514
But sometimes the
behavior of that tuna just

10:49.582 --> 10:50.915
makes that impossible.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.183
MANNY: Forward right!
Forward right!

10:52.252 --> 10:54.786
BOB: We won't get a good price
if the dart hits the belly.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.255
Hitting away from the
belly is very difficult to do

10:57.257 --> 10:59.257
if that tuna is
the one in control.

10:59.926 --> 11:00.925
MANNY: Come on.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.662
JOHN: Oh! Hit him!
Did you get him?

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
MANNY: No.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.464
JOHN: Forward!
Manny get the line.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.399
Get it out.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.800
BOB: Did you hit him?

11:08.802 --> 11:10.868
MANNY: Not at all. BOB:
Not good. MANNY: Not at all.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.737
JOHN: It's not,
it's not in him.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.272
MANNY: Not in him.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.022
MANNY: No, no.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.123
JOHN: I think you
missed him again.

11:32.142 --> 11:33.958
MANNY: Forward! Watch that line.
Forward!

11:34.294 --> 11:35.627
JOHN: Forward! Forward! Forward!

11:35.695 --> 11:37.295
BOB: Manny, get the line.
Get it out.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.030
Did you hit him?

11:39.099 --> 11:40.631
MANNY: Not good. Not at all.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.166
JOHN: It's not,
it's not in him.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.101
MANNY: Not in him.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.368
(bleep) aye.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.437
BOB: Yeah, that fish
came flying by the boat,

11:46.440 --> 11:48.440
but he was not ready at all.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.041
He was completely black backed.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.910
Basically, he came underneath
the transom and he just came flying.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.081
JOHN: He's going forward right.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.650
MANNY: Got him. Gaff.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.319
BOB: Got 'em?
MANNY: Yeah.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.390
BOB: He's ours. Yeah.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.992
JOHN: Yeah, Manny!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.228
BOB: Bro. We got him!

12:10.864 --> 12:11.796
MANNY: We got him!

12:11.798 --> 12:13.798
BOB: We're good.
Back on the meat.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.733
We're good. Woo!

12:15.736 --> 12:16.684
MANNY: Whoo!

12:16.737 --> 12:17.936
It wasn't the prettiest
at the end there,

12:18.004 --> 12:18.937
but what are you gonna do?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.204
This fish was going wild.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.407
He kept making crazy turns,
but we got the shot done.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.142
That's all that counts.
We're going home, baby.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.577
This is our year.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.278
One, two, three.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.016
JOHN: That's a good one.
Here we go.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.751
BOB: That's a good one.
There we go, boys.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.086
All right, let's measure him up.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.554
MANNY: What do you got?

12:36.556 --> 12:39.224
BOB: He's 90. MANNY: All
right. BOB: He's our ticket home.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.893
We'll take it.
Gloucester bound, baby.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.029
MANNY: Let's get out of here.
BOB: Let's go!

12:50.570 --> 12:52.036
DAVE: You there, Paul?

12:52.038 --> 12:53.772
<i>PAUL (over radio): I am, yes.</i>

12:54.507 --> 12:55.573
<i>DAVE (over radio): Bob got one.</i>

12:55.642 --> 12:57.108
PAUL: Unbelievable.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.043
We're gonna take
a ride to Chatham.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.311
We are out of here.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.113
I have to make a move.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.049
We're wasting time here at
Stellwagen Bank while boats

13:05.051 --> 13:06.518
are catching down the Cape.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.119
Yeah, we're out of here.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.187
We're out of here.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.523
We still don't have
our first bluefin.

13:11.725 --> 13:15.293
It's a long trip to Chatham but we
cannot waste any more time here.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.328
Even if we don't get one today.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.463
We'll get one tomorrow,

13:18.531 --> 13:20.231
so there's a paycheck
in the future.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.200
Prices are good.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.068
We can't be sitting
here anymore.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.237
That's why I built this boat,
so we can go hunt.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.272
That's what we're doing.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.808
We're going on a hunt.
We're going to Chatham.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.743
There's just a body
of fish down there.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.479
You just got to find them.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.714
We're out of here.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.056
TYLER: No marks. Slow fishing.

13:46.092 --> 13:46.958
How about it pop-pop?

13:48.094 --> 13:49.627
SPURGE: Yeah, go ahead.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.462
<i>TYLER (over radio): How
deep are you guys over there?</i>

13:52.098 --> 13:53.097
SPURGE: To 120.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.166
We marked some fish
already so it looks good.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.300
<i>TYLER (over radio): I want
to reposition a little bit.</i>

13:56.303 --> 13:57.902
TYLER: I need to get a
little closer to you.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.504
SPURGE: All right, I'll
see you in a little bit.

13:59.706 --> 14:00.572
<i>TYLER (over radio): We got
to get 'em going today.</i>

14:00.640 --> 14:02.106
<i>We got to get a fish.</i>

14:02.909 --> 14:05.109
TYLER: Spurge is just a few
miles north of us near Maine.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.245
I wanna be where the marks
are showing up because

14:07.247 --> 14:08.379
we gotta stay ahead.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.849
If Spurge is seeing
signs of tuna,

14:10.917 --> 14:12.684
I wanna move closer to his spot.

14:15.788 --> 14:20.558
Oh boy. Oh no.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.397
MARISSA: What's going on?
TYLER: Throttles won't work.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.532
MARISSA: Uh-oh.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.134
TYLER: When the throttles
don't work that means we can't

14:30.203 --> 14:33.004
move the boat forward or
backward from the deck controls.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.940
It's gonna be chaotic as it
can be if we hook up because

14:36.009 --> 14:39.277
that means I'm gonna have to drive
from inside and run back and forth.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.413
Oh! I can still
steer and drive the boat,

14:42.482 --> 14:44.349
but it's really dangerous to
move the boat anywhere before

14:44.417 --> 14:46.150
you have diagnosed
the mechanical issue.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.819
I got to figure this out
before we move anywhere.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.355
Something happened
with the steering line.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.958
<i>TYLER (over radio): We
have no throttles, no shifters.</i>

14:54.694 --> 14:56.494
SPURGE: Oh boy,
that's, that's tough.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.962
TYLER: I can't move now.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.631
So I better hope a
tuna swims over here.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.100
SPURGE: All right. Good luck.
Catch 'em up.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.503
TYLER: We were gonna move,
now we're gonna stay.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.138
Maybe things can change for us.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.407
MARISSA: This sucks.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.813
BOB: Two fish. I love it.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.650
What's happening, PJ?
How are you?

15:19.653 --> 15:21.736
PJ: You guys are burning
the candle at all ends.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.120
BOB: Well,
this one is 90 inches.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.322
All right.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.257
PJ: Let's see
what we got here.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.593
BOB: It's been a tough
start for a few guys,

15:28.661 --> 15:30.127
but we've had a
really good start.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.131
So far the domestic market
is very strong and that means

15:33.199 --> 15:35.700
America has opened up again,
and that's huge for us.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.603
What do we got here, PJ?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.672
PJ: 277 pounds dressed.

15:41.675 --> 15:42.807
MANNY: Yeah, we'll take that.
BOB: All right. That works.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.208
PJ: It's good size.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.209
Right, guys?

15:45.211 --> 15:46.344
MANNY: Nice job. Nice job.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.679
PJ: So let's check it
out and see what we got.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.213
BOB: Let's check it out, man.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.283
Hopefully our bluefin has
a lot of fat, good color,

15:52.352 --> 15:53.952
and a translucent core,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.220
so the buyer will
give us a great price.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.355
PJ: All right.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.489
MANNY: What do we got?
What do we got?

15:58.491 --> 15:59.690
PJ: Nice looking fish, guys.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.409
It's, uh, you know the
color is a little bit dark,

16:01.461 --> 16:02.827
I mean, it's good a red color,

16:02.895 --> 16:04.428
but it's dark,
which, you know, means

16:04.431 --> 16:05.563
it doesn't have as much fat.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.965
It's still a solid fish.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.566
The core is fine.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.101
Good marketable size.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.570
You know I can do.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.039
BOB: Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.425
PJ: I can get you
16 bucks a pound for it.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.709
MANNY: All right.
Yeah! Nice job.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.445
PJ: Yeah. Hopefully
we'll see you tomorrow.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.514
BOB: We're gonna try
to see you every day.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.782
PJ: Every day.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.783
JOHN: All right.
See you tomorrow.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.385
PJ: Thanks, boys.
MANNY: See you tomorrow, PJ.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.087
BOB: We went to Chatham
and got a real nice fish.

16:29.105 --> 16:31.255
We're hoping to do that same
thing tomorrow and keep doing

16:31.324 --> 16:33.324
it until the fish are
gone from that area.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.060
It's a lot of fuel money,
a lot of cost involved,

16:36.062 --> 16:37.662
but we wanna be on top,

16:37.730 --> 16:39.630
we're gonna do whatever
it takes to get there.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.532
Two fish on board.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.435
I hope we can keep that up.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.838
Woo!

16:51.611 --> 16:53.478
NICHOLAS: I like being
by ourselves up here.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.813
JACK: Yeah, me too.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.748
NICHOLAS: Just did
a quick relocation.

16:57.751 --> 17:00.151
Hopefully after we
get all the baits out,

17:00.219 --> 17:01.752
we'll be tied up.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.355
JACK: It's fishy
out here for sure.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.957
We're over at the
northwest corner here.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.159
Stellwagen moved up a few miles.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.761
It seems like there's
fish all the way from

17:10.764 --> 17:12.363
Maine down to Cape Cod.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.966
We're right in the middle.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.368
NICHOLAS: Ready?
JACK: Order up. Fresh mackerel.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.905
We got to catch a fish every
single day if we wanna stay relevant.

17:20.973 --> 17:21.973
You know, at the end of the day,

17:22.041 --> 17:23.174
it's all about making money.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.575
Takeoff.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.812
The less far we got to travel the
more money we're gonna make.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.849
(beeping)

17:31.851 --> 17:33.985
Oh we're marking 'em.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.154
NICHOLAS: Waiting to get eaten.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.790
JACK: We need a fat one.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.191
(reel clicking)

17:40.193 --> 17:41.426
(reel unspooling rapidly)

17:41.461 --> 17:43.661
NICHOLAS: Oh, we're tight!
JACK: There he is.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.932
Woo! He's coming around.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.868
All right, go do
your thing on the kite.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.204
NICHOLAS: Yup.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.676
JACK: Hooked up here.
Just in time.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.277
Right in the tide.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.713
Good fish. We need this one.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.701
Gonna do everything we
can to get him in the boat.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.721
He's close, Nick!

18:11.558 --> 18:12.890
Nick, he's really close.

18:12.959 --> 18:13.891
NICHOLAS: Yup.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.860
JACK: Ready, come on. Ready?
NICHOLAS: Yup.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.767
Reverse!

18:23.169 --> 18:23.968
Neutral.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.237
JACK: Yup. He's in his circle.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.572
NICHOLAS: Yeah.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.709
JACK: Deep color.
Ready? Come on up.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.779
He's gonna come at us hard.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.983
NICHOLAS: Here he comes.
Hold on. Hold on. Hit him!

18:39.986 --> 18:41.252
JACK: Oh! Missed him.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.586
NICHOLAS: Oh, watch the line!

18:42.589 --> 18:44.355
Watch the line!
Watch the line.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.480
NICHOLAS: He's gonna
come at us hard.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.550
Here he comes.
Hold on. Hold on!

18:56.553 --> 18:57.552
Hit him!

18:57.954 --> 18:58.886
JACK: Oh, missed him!

18:58.955 --> 19:00.488
NICHOLAS: Oh, watch the line.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.756
Watch the line.
Watch the line.

19:01.824 --> 19:03.524
JACK: Oh, how did I miss that?

19:04.828 --> 19:06.661
NICHOLAS:
Make this next one count.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.432
Yup. You got him.

19:11.434 --> 19:12.366
JACK: Put the
drag down a little.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.702
NICHOLAS: Yeah. Yeah.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.770
He's gonna be
motoring, get ready.

19:16.773 --> 19:18.439
JACK: Yeah. I know. I know.
Here he comes.

19:18.508 --> 19:20.908
NICHOLAS: A little more,
a little more, a little more.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.777
NICHOLAS: Got him?

19:23.780 --> 19:24.845
JACK: Yeah.

19:24.848 --> 19:26.581
NICHOLAS: Bada-bing
bada-boom, let's go!

19:26.649 --> 19:28.916
JACK: Woo! Yeah, buddy. Yeah.
NICHOLAS: Woo!

19:28.918 --> 19:30.384
JACK: Second fish of the year.

19:31.054 --> 19:33.054
NICHOLAS: We'll stay here and
let everyone else go traveling

19:33.122 --> 19:34.188
and try to find them.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.390
JACK: I just texted Dave.
I told him we got him.

19:36.459 --> 19:38.860
Those guys are spending
more in fuel than that fish

19:38.928 --> 19:40.127
is worth right there.

19:40.196 --> 19:41.996
NICHOLAS: Those guys
are gonna be heated.

19:41.998 --> 19:42.997
JACK: Heated.

19:43.065 --> 19:44.331
At the end of
the day Nick and I,

19:44.334 --> 19:45.533
we're out here to make money.

19:45.535 --> 19:46.600
Nice.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.736
We don't really see
the need to be driving

19:48.738 --> 19:52.406
160 miles round trip
to catch the same fish

19:52.408 --> 19:54.341
that we can catch right here.

19:54.344 --> 19:55.409
86.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.477
NICHOLAS:
I'll take that all day.

19:56.479 --> 19:57.678
JACK: Nice work, buddy.
NICHOLAS: Woo!

19:57.747 --> 20:00.681
JACK: 86 inches of butterball.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.483
NICHOLAS: Keep fishing the
backyard until the backyard

20:02.485 --> 20:04.285
doesn't show up for us.

20:04.888 --> 20:08.189
JACK: Didn't have to
go to Chatham, baby. Woo!

20:13.963 --> 20:15.363
DAVE: I don't
like Chatham anymore.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.598
We are going back to Stellwagen.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.366
Jack got 'em!

20:19.369 --> 20:20.368
GEORDIE: Did he?

20:20.436 --> 20:22.637
DAVE: Yup. We left the
place where he got him.

20:23.172 --> 20:25.506
SANDRO: We'll just keep
zigging and zagging.

20:25.842 --> 20:27.174
DAVE: Hey, TJ.

20:27.911 --> 20:29.910
<i>DAVE (over radio): Give
me a shout when you can.</i>

20:29.913 --> 20:30.978
TJ: Go ahead.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.180
DAVE: Jack just wrapped 'em up.

20:33.716 --> 20:35.783
<i>DAVE (over radio): He
just texted me he got 'em.</i>

20:36.319 --> 20:37.318
TJ: Wow.
We're getting smoked, Cap.

20:37.386 --> 20:39.120
PAUL: One of us are bound
to run into something.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.055
DAVE: You got a better
chance of getting 'em on the

20:41.123 --> 20:42.189
bank or something like that.

20:42.191 --> 20:44.191
<i>DAVE (over radio): I
just can't, can't do this.</i>

20:44.193 --> 20:45.659
<i>We're going back to Stellwagen.</i>

20:45.662 --> 20:47.861
<i>Go up there and sit on the hook.</i>

20:47.864 --> 20:49.463
DAVE: That's
what we're gonna do.

20:49.532 --> 20:50.798
We're leaving right now.

20:51.801 --> 20:53.901
All right, we're out of here.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.678
JACK: We could use a
good price to kinda work our

21:03.746 --> 21:05.679
way up the leaderboard.

21:06.082 --> 21:07.615
PJ: Way to go, boys.
You got one today.

21:07.617 --> 21:08.883
JACK: Happy to have him.
Two in a row.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.752
PJ: Nice.
Yeah, let's see what you got.

21:13.823 --> 21:16.824
JACK: Catching our second
bluefin of the season feels awesome.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.960
Nick and I love
fishing close to home.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.427
And if bluefin are showing up,

21:20.430 --> 21:22.162
that's where we're
gonna stay and catch 'em.

21:22.965 --> 21:24.498
We just got to hope
they're good quality so we can

21:24.500 --> 21:26.033
get a big payday.

21:27.169 --> 21:28.168
What do we got here?

21:28.171 --> 21:30.504
PJ: 251 pounds dressed.
JACK: We'll take that.

21:30.573 --> 21:32.607
PJ: Let's check it out.
See what we got, boys.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.111
Well, very nice color.

21:37.179 --> 21:38.312
It's a little dark.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.114
It needs a little more fat.

21:40.182 --> 21:42.316
You know, it's kind
of middle of the road,

21:42.385 --> 21:46.587
so this one here
I can get you...

21:46.989 --> 21:48.322
12 bucks a pound for it.

21:48.324 --> 21:49.724
JACK: All right. Let's go.

21:49.792 --> 21:50.924
NICHOLAS: Yeah, all day.

21:50.927 --> 21:52.526
PJ: Keep 'em coming, boys.
Keep 'em coming. All right.

21:52.595 --> 21:53.794
NICHOLAS: Thank you, PJ.

21:53.796 --> 21:55.396
JACK: Last year
things didn't go our way.

21:55.398 --> 21:56.730
This year we're
right where we should be.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.532
We're coming for that top
spot this year and, you know,

21:58.534 --> 22:00.067
if anyone can do it, it's us.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.602
Get ready for tomorrow.

22:01.604 --> 22:03.270
Grind another one away.

22:17.019 --> 22:18.419
TYLER: We got two
rods out right now.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.354
We're getting ready
to put our third rod out.

22:20.356 --> 22:22.756
I haven't figured out what's
going on with the throttles yet,

22:22.759 --> 22:25.159
but in the meantime we
still got to fish and this

22:25.161 --> 22:26.960
spot is still looking good.

22:26.963 --> 22:28.696
Merm and I have
been grinding, hard.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.231
When you have a two-person
crew it is taxing on you being

22:31.234 --> 22:32.299
out here around the clock,

22:32.301 --> 22:33.501
I mean it's just the two of us.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.436
We don't have a third
person to bridge that gap.

22:35.438 --> 22:36.837
And when we're
not catching fish,

22:36.839 --> 22:38.572
we're going 24 hours a day.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.508
I mean, we don't stop.

22:40.976 --> 22:41.976
We're here.

22:42.044 --> 22:44.045
We might as well give
it our best effort.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.714
So, here's how
we're gonna rig up.

22:46.716 --> 22:49.383
We got our 170 pound
floro carbon leader.

22:49.385 --> 22:51.185
We got our 9-0 pooka hook.

22:51.187 --> 22:53.254
An LI crimp.

22:53.656 --> 22:55.255
And we got a beautiful herring.

22:55.258 --> 22:57.992
I always put the mono in from
the point side of the hook.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.594
To me I think that's
a huge secret.

23:00.663 --> 23:02.262
We crimp it twice.

23:02.265 --> 23:04.131
A nice rig just like that.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.267
I just learned this by
like fishing, you know,

23:06.335 --> 23:08.536
you got to figure out
ways to try and trick fish

23:08.604 --> 23:10.604
into eating other fish.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.006
Going into the gill.

23:12.074 --> 23:13.941
Now, we wanna have the
point come out of the belly.

23:14.009 --> 23:15.609
So, we're gonna take
our rigging needle and

23:15.678 --> 23:16.944
sew it in place.

23:17.012 --> 23:18.946
Those go into the gill plate.

23:19.014 --> 23:22.683
The last step is you go
right up through the nose,

23:22.752 --> 23:24.284
go around the mono.

23:24.287 --> 23:26.487
I think a tuna would eat that.

23:26.555 --> 23:27.888
This is a nice bait right here.

23:27.890 --> 23:29.824
Ready to go.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.026
Perfect baits.

23:32.094 --> 23:33.861
We got to get 'em tonight.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.578
MARCIANO: We're off
on our secret spot.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.179
We should have
had a bite by now.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.314
What the hell is taking so long?

23:54.317 --> 23:56.317
Bob Cook and the
Fat Tuna's one ahead.

23:56.385 --> 23:57.985
Jack and the Time Flies.

23:58.053 --> 23:59.186
That little boat,

23:59.255 --> 24:02.256
he's working hard and
I'll be the first to admit,

24:02.258 --> 24:05.326
I'll always be keeping
my eye on Pinwheel.

24:05.394 --> 24:07.394
Pulled ahead of us last trip.

24:08.064 --> 24:10.331
So it's crucial
we get hot again.

24:10.399 --> 24:12.399
I suggest we change our bait.

24:12.401 --> 24:14.535
Change our bait,
change our fate.

24:15.471 --> 24:18.138
Oh, that's a nice one, Joe.

24:18.141 --> 24:20.107
JOE: No peeking.

24:20.543 --> 24:21.675
Nice mackerel.

24:21.744 --> 24:23.410
MARCIANO: Nice,
nice mackerel, yup.

24:23.479 --> 24:25.279
We'll change bait
every hour if we can.

24:25.281 --> 24:29.350
Having a fresh, frisky bait
is always your best bet.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.686
A lot of herring and mackerel
are coming through this area,

24:32.755 --> 24:35.689
so I think both types of
bait should do the trick.

24:37.159 --> 24:39.093
Sometimes a fresh little
bait change can make all the

24:39.161 --> 24:40.961
difference in the world.

24:43.833 --> 24:46.167
TYLER: Well, if we have a
problem with the throttles,

24:46.235 --> 24:48.035
the steering back there
is not going to work.

24:48.037 --> 24:49.103
So if we hook up to a fish,

24:49.171 --> 24:50.571
I'm gonna have to
drive from in here.

24:50.639 --> 24:52.406
It's gonna make
it very difficult.

24:55.378 --> 24:57.378
MARISSA: Oh, more seaweeds.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.516
(beeping)

25:02.585 --> 25:04.051
TYLER: Oh, boy.

25:04.053 --> 25:06.386
Oh boy, Merm, we're
marking 'em right now, Merm.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.423
MARISSA: Big mark?
TYLER: Big, all over it.

25:09.992 --> 25:15.930
(beeping)

25:16.198 --> 25:18.999
MARCIANO: There we go.
There's a mark.

25:20.135 --> 25:22.736
We got a pair of them
down there, boys.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.605
There's two of them right on it.

25:24.607 --> 25:29.943
(beeping)

25:29.946 --> 25:32.012
(reel clicking)

25:32.081 --> 25:33.280
(reel unspooling rapidly)

25:33.349 --> 25:35.749
TYLER: We're on! We're on!
Herring slayer, Merm.

25:36.218 --> 25:39.687
Start the boat.
Get rid of the anchor.

25:40.156 --> 25:41.622
(beeping)

25:41.624 --> 25:43.357
MARCIANO: Three of them.

25:43.359 --> 25:45.626
(reel clicking)

25:45.694 --> 25:46.894
JOE: Yeah, yeah,
we're on something. Yup.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.428
(reel unspooling rapidly)

25:48.431 --> 25:49.630
JASON: Screamer.

25:49.698 --> 25:50.964
MARCIANO: We're on!
Is he on there?

25:50.967 --> 25:53.767
JASON: Yeah, that's him. JOE:
Got him on. JASON: Got him on.

25:54.370 --> 25:57.104
TYLER: We got him on.
Oh, he's taking a lot of line.

25:57.707 --> 25:59.440
We're on, baby! We're on!

26:01.844 --> 26:03.944
Got no throttles.
Can't drive.

26:04.914 --> 26:06.881
Let it go! Let it go!

26:07.783 --> 26:09.983
MARCIANO: Well,
we're on a fish.

26:10.253 --> 26:11.919
JASON: Got something
on the line here.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.587
Not too sure.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.389
It's a jumbo.

26:15.591 --> 26:17.591
MARCIANO: I don't
think it's a big fish,

26:17.660 --> 26:20.461
but it's definitely a tuna fish,
so that's a good sign.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.997
JASON: Got the sinker.

26:23.265 --> 26:25.532
TYLER: All right. Here we go.
Let's get this one in.

26:25.601 --> 26:27.635
We got no throttles.
We can't drive from outside.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.003
We need this one bad.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.922
MARISSA: Tyler!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

26:32.007 --> 26:33.206
TYLER: What? What?

26:33.209 --> 26:35.042
MARISSA: The anchor.
TYLER: Oh, (bleep)!

26:46.205 --> 26:48.271
TYLER: All right. Here we go.
Let's get this one in.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.406
We got no throttles.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.008
We can't drive from outside.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.876
We need this one bad.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.678
MARISSA: Tyler!
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

26:54.814 --> 26:56.013
TYLER: What? What?

26:56.015 --> 26:58.148
MARISSA: The anchor.
TYLER: Oh, (bleep)!

26:58.550 --> 27:01.619
(bleep), all right, I'll
get it away from the anchor.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.756
Hold on. Okay.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.624
It should be free
from the anchor now.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.793
MARISSA: Oh, yes. Yes.

27:11.497 --> 27:14.098
TYLER: Woo! Let's go.
MARISSA: Good job, Ty.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.267
TYLER: All right.
I hope we can get this one.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.102
(tension snap)

27:19.105 --> 27:20.704
Oh, pulled the hook!

27:20.773 --> 27:24.475
Just felt it pull. Dammit!

27:27.913 --> 27:30.114
MARISSA: How do we pull a hook?

27:30.182 --> 27:31.649
TYLER: I don't know.
Something let go.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.019
And that's all.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.064
Failure to get the hook
in the fish there, you know.

27:47.132 --> 27:49.066
You know, right there,
we came tight off the bite.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.735
The bite was like,
it wasn't a good hook set.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.403
You like to see them
when they hit it like a

27:53.406 --> 27:55.739
freight train and just,
when he does all that,

27:55.741 --> 27:57.808
it means he ate the bait
and he got gut hooked.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.010
And we really never
just got a good hook set.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.945
Sucks.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.146
If we got throttle control,

28:03.149 --> 28:04.948
we might have been able to
keep that fish on the line.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.350
Bummer.

28:06.619 --> 28:08.285
MARCIANO: Deep color.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.353
JASON: I'm just putting
the heat on him now.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.222
MARCIANO: Yup. Yup.
JASON: Got the little...

28:12.224 --> 28:14.224
MARCIANO: I don't think
this is a monster fish.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.326
I'm guessing it's a short.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.248
JASON: Yup.
Definitely a short.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.033
MARCIANO: But we'll
see if we can tag it.

28:23.102 --> 28:27.438
We're not allowed to keep a
bluefin tuna under 73 inches

28:28.541 --> 28:31.508
according to the Federal
Fisheries Regulations.

28:32.177 --> 28:35.079
But we tag this shorter
bluefin for the scientific

28:35.097 --> 28:38.182
information that goes
along with managing the

28:38.250 --> 28:40.584
bluefin tuna fishery.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.452
JASON: You got
good control of him,

28:42.455 --> 28:44.788
so just take your time.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.273
MARCIANO: Did you get him?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.524
JOE: Yeah.

28:47.593 --> 28:48.726
MARCIANO: All right.
Well, that's it, boys.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.127
We got a tagged fish.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.795
Jay, you think you
can recover that hook?

28:51.797 --> 28:53.163
JASON: Yeah.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.465
MARCIANO: All right.
Here we go.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.999
Good release.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.934
Let's see if we
can get another one.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.904
Where there's little fish,
there can be big fish.

29:11.484 --> 29:12.950
DAVE: This is the go-to spot.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.151
GEORDIE: This is it.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.619
DAVE: We're gonna
pull one out of here.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.554
Let it go.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.030
Bottom?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.165
GEORDIE: Yup.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.833
DAVE: All right. Good to go.
Let's get him, Sanchi.

29:29.902 --> 29:30.901
All right?

29:30.903 --> 29:33.020
SANDRO: Hope so.
Conditions are good here.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.372
There's bait here.
There's whales here.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.275
It's pretty damn fishy.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.644
DAVE: Running down south.

29:40.646 --> 29:43.547
Even if we caught a fish
with all the fuel we burned,

29:43.566 --> 29:45.582
we would operate at a loss,
so why we went down there,

29:45.651 --> 29:47.117
I have no idea.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.052
My fuel bill is
gonna be 1,500 bucks.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.053
That's just the way it is.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.521
But we want to catch a fish.

29:51.524 --> 29:52.990
Hopefully, this tide
gets going a little bit,

29:53.058 --> 29:54.191
it can hold us here.

29:54.259 --> 29:56.260
We should have just
stayed here at Stellwagen

29:56.328 --> 29:57.460
in the first place.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.796
It's not like me chasing
the bite and going to Chatham.

29:59.799 --> 30:03.733
I regret not trusting
the info that I've logged

30:03.736 --> 30:05.669
where we've caught in the past.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.138
We caught a jumbo at
Stellwagen two years ago

30:08.140 --> 30:09.740
around this time.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.476
It's an underwater mountain
where bait likes to congregate,

30:12.544 --> 30:15.145
therefore bluefin
tuna like to feed.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.148
We need the spot to
produce now in order

30:18.217 --> 30:20.684
to get our first bluefin.

30:21.537 --> 30:22.953
GEORDIE: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.554
Hello, small herring.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.423
We made the call to go
down to Chatham there.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.959
And whether it was right
or wrong, or good or bad,

30:28.961 --> 30:30.093
that's the call we made.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.228
There's no changing it,

30:31.230 --> 30:32.896
so figure out your next move and

30:32.965 --> 30:34.298
you deal with it later.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.766
Maybe that was
the wrong decision,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.634
but it's the decision we made.

30:37.636 --> 30:38.635
What are you gonna do about it?

30:38.704 --> 30:40.103
DAVE: Yeah, it would be
nice to catch a fish.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.239
Pay for some expenses and put
a little money in our pocket.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.507
GEORDIE: Yup.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.975
DAVE: Just to get
things rolling here.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.311
GEORDIE: It sure would.
DAVE: You know?

30:51.450 --> 30:53.183
(beeping)

30:53.252 --> 30:55.085
SANDRO: Hey.

30:55.788 --> 30:57.487
DAVE: Yes, sir.

30:58.257 --> 31:02.860
(beeping)

31:03.128 --> 31:05.629
DAVE: Come on.
Come on, let's get a bite.

31:05.798 --> 31:07.397
What do we gotta
do to get a bite?

31:07.399 --> 31:11.401
<i>♪ We need to catch a fish
we need to catch a fish ♪</i>

31:12.070 --> 31:13.403
DAVE: Why can't
we get a break?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.938
(reel clicking)

31:15.007 --> 31:16.406
SANDRO: Oh, he's on.
He's on.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.741
DAVE: He's on. Start it up.

31:17.809 --> 31:18.808
SANDRO: We're on.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.610
DAVE: We're on.
Yes, we are. Yes, sir.

31:20.613 --> 31:24.248
All right, Geordie.

31:27.820 --> 31:30.086
Hold on. All right.
He's on right now.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.889
SANDRO: Hold on. Stop,
stop, stop. I got it. I got it.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.623
Throw in the anchor.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.158
GEORDIE: This is bad.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.493
DAVE: Oh, I can't believe
this fish is going right into

31:36.561 --> 31:37.895
this stuff here.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.563
Hold onto it, Geordie.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.897
SANDRO: He's going
right towards the anchor.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.032
GEORDIE: I'm doing the best I.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.166
DAVE: Do not let it go.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.568
GEORDIE: I'm trying.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.969
DAVE: Unbelievable.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.572
The anchor line's
gonna cut off our fish.

31:55.531 --> 31:56.730
SANDRO: Hold on.
Stop, stop, stop.

31:56.732 --> 31:57.931
I got it. I got it.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.532
DAVE: We're on the anchor.
GEORDIE: This is bad.

31:59.535 --> 32:00.867
DAVE: Oh, I can't believe
this fish is going right into

32:00.936 --> 32:02.669
this stuff here.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.271
Hold onto it, Geordie.

32:04.273 --> 32:06.606
SANDRO: He's going
right towards the anchor.

32:06.809 --> 32:07.741
GEORDIE: I'm doing the best I.

32:07.809 --> 32:08.875
DAVE: Do not let it go.

32:08.944 --> 32:10.076
GEORDIE: I'm trying.

32:10.079 --> 32:11.812
DAVE: The anchor line's
gonna cut off our fish.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.147
SANDRO: What a disaster.
GEORDIE: Ready?

32:14.216 --> 32:16.049
DAVE: No, no, no, no,
no, no, get on the side.

32:17.553 --> 32:19.019
SANDRO: Woo-hoo!

32:19.087 --> 32:20.020
DAVE: All right, we're good.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.154
GEORDIE: Nice job, guys.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.155
DAVE: All right,
let's get out in the open.

32:22.224 --> 32:24.491
We're okay.
That's the real deal.

32:24.493 --> 32:27.227
SANDRO: Yeah, it is. Man.
Real deal here, boys.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.831
Woo!
We got a good fish on here.

32:36.905 --> 32:40.040
A lot of head shaking.
Big boy.

32:42.244 --> 32:43.510
Deep color.

32:43.512 --> 32:44.845
DAVE: Good color, good color.

32:44.913 --> 32:46.179
SANDRO: Cut the
wheel to the right.

32:46.248 --> 32:48.715
Cut the wheel to the right.
Reverse.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.784
DAVE: Swivel coming up.

32:52.054 --> 32:54.521
Good color.
Maybe we'll get a shot here.

32:54.790 --> 32:55.655
GEORDIE: He's tired. He's tired.

32:55.658 --> 32:56.590
SANDRO: He's way up now.

32:56.658 --> 32:58.492
Now is your shot.
Now you can hit him.

33:07.669 --> 33:09.069
GEORDIE: He's right here.
He's still right here.

33:09.137 --> 33:10.404
SANDRO: Neutral, neutral,
neutral, neutral.

33:10.472 --> 33:12.339
GEORDIE: You're
gonna get that again, Dave.

33:13.342 --> 33:14.407
SANDRO: He's coming way up, now.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.675
Now you can get a shot off.

33:15.678 --> 33:17.511
Reverse. Reverse.
Hard reverse.

33:20.282 --> 33:23.283
DAVE: I got him.
He's coming left.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.018
GEORDIE: Watch the throttle,
get the rope.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.686
DAVE: Yeah, come
right at me, Geordie.

33:26.689 --> 33:28.622
SANDRO: I got him.

33:28.891 --> 33:33.026
GEORDIE: Yes, sir! Woo!
Hey, good going, guys.

33:33.362 --> 33:35.228
SANDRO: (bleep) yeah,
we needed that one.

33:35.297 --> 33:36.363
GEORDIE: Way to
stick through that.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.831
We got one, finally.

33:37.833 --> 33:38.899
DAVE: Let's go on a tear now.

33:38.967 --> 33:41.434
Now we finally have our
first fish of the season.

33:41.437 --> 33:43.370
Coming back to
Stellwagen paid off.

33:43.639 --> 33:45.038
GEORDIE: Homeward bound.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.706
SANDRO: Let's go.

33:46.709 --> 33:48.308
DAVE: We had a really
tough start this year,

33:48.377 --> 33:50.644
so we need a really great
price for this fish to make up

33:50.712 --> 33:52.779
for lost time and money.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.980
But one thing is for sure,

33:54.049 --> 33:56.049
the Dot-Com is back in the game.

33:56.051 --> 33:58.385
Let's pull this sucker in.

33:58.453 --> 33:59.252
Yeah.

33:59.321 --> 34:00.787
GEORDIE: Keep going. Good.

34:00.856 --> 34:02.255
SANDRO: Good.
Nice-looking fish.

34:02.324 --> 34:03.724
Let's see what we got.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.392
94. Woo, baby!

34:05.460 --> 34:06.726
GEORDIE: 94.

34:06.729 --> 34:09.996
DAVE: Good job, guys.
SANDRO: In the old honey hole.

34:14.669 --> 34:16.603
MARISSA: So stressful.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.805
TYLER: Right now, our
throttles aren't working outside

34:18.807 --> 34:20.140
and I don't know why.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.208
And I can drive from in here,

34:21.276 --> 34:23.143
but I can't drive from out back.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.544
And that means
if we hook a fish,

34:24.613 --> 34:25.879
it's gonna be very difficult.

34:25.947 --> 34:27.547
So, I'm gonna go down and
test the power source to

34:27.616 --> 34:29.282
see if that's maybe
why they're not working.

34:29.351 --> 34:31.284
I've tried troubleshooting
everything I can think of,

34:31.353 --> 34:33.353
but there's still one
more thing to check.

34:33.422 --> 34:35.288
And we hooked up and
lost a fish this morning,

34:35.357 --> 34:36.823
so I haven't been able
to get to looking at

34:36.892 --> 34:38.024
the electrical box.

34:38.026 --> 34:39.826
I mean, it's hard when
there's only two of you.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.027
We're sticking around Maine,

34:41.029 --> 34:42.562
because we know there's
tuna coming through.

34:42.564 --> 34:44.964
But this steering issue
is still a problem.

34:44.967 --> 34:47.567
MARISSA: Does this compartment
always have a lot of water in it?

34:47.569 --> 34:50.137
TYLER: No, but there
is moisture down here.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.706
It was probably from the winter.

34:52.774 --> 34:54.174
There's corrosion there.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.176
Give me the little wire brush.

34:56.711 --> 34:58.712
A cleaning might help restore
these throttles for the time being,

34:58.780 --> 35:00.313
because if I hook up to a fish,

35:00.382 --> 35:02.182
I want to give ourselves
the best shot at being able to

35:02.250 --> 35:03.983
maneuver and catch the tunas.

35:04.386 --> 35:06.920
If we hook up again, back
throttles help us stay in

35:06.922 --> 35:08.722
control of a chaotic fish.

35:08.790 --> 35:11.524
Right now, we're losing
control of our boat and our lead.

35:11.993 --> 35:13.860
It's some, it's corrosion.

35:13.996 --> 35:18.031
(beeping)

35:18.934 --> 35:20.800
MARISSA: We're marking 'em.

35:21.069 --> 35:22.335
TYLER: Oh, boy.

35:22.337 --> 35:23.737
(beeping)

35:23.805 --> 35:24.805
(reel clicking)

35:24.873 --> 35:26.606
TYLER: We got 'em on.
We got 'em on.

35:26.675 --> 35:28.475
(reel unspooling rapidly)

35:28.543 --> 35:30.710
MARISSA: We're on!

35:31.480 --> 35:36.249
TYLER: Woo! Ha-ha!

35:38.086 --> 35:39.753
Woo!

35:39.821 --> 35:42.088
Hope we can hang onto this one.

35:45.494 --> 35:46.860
TYLER: No controls.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.630
TYLER: Merm, we got
no controls here.

35:50.632 --> 35:52.432
MARISSA: What happens if he
goes under the boat and we

35:52.434 --> 35:54.167
need to go, like, forward?

35:54.169 --> 35:55.435
TYLER: We can't maneuver
the boat from here.

35:55.437 --> 35:57.037
That means if we're gonna
move the boat at all,

35:57.105 --> 35:58.104
I gotta do it from inside.

35:58.106 --> 35:59.306
MARISSA: No.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.409
TYLER: Merm, get on the rod.
Switch with me. Go back there.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.312
(reel unspooling rapidly)

36:05.380 --> 36:08.047
MARISSA: Definitely a tuna.
A big tuna.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.583
TYLER: It's very stressful.
I don't know what's happening.

36:09.651 --> 36:11.184
If the fish charges the
boat or makes a movement,

36:11.253 --> 36:12.919
I'm not gonna be
able to make a move.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.721
I mean, my throttles
are all the way inside.

36:14.723 --> 36:16.723
MARISSA: I'll just yell
to you where to go.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.258
TYLER: Yup.
That's all we can do here.

36:18.527 --> 36:19.659
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

36:19.661 --> 36:21.127
Easy when he comes at you.

36:21.196 --> 36:23.129
If the tuna swims towards us,
we can't move the boat to keep

36:23.198 --> 36:26.266
the line tight, and the
hook could fall right out.

36:26.334 --> 36:29.202
If the tuna moves away,
we can't chase it down using

36:29.271 --> 36:31.338
the controls on the back deck.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.874
One of us has to move the
boat from inside the wheelhouse

36:33.942 --> 36:35.608
in order for us to gain control.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.911
It's our only
option in the chaos.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.946
MARISSA: It makes it harder.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.282
It's like adding
30 seconds and you need to be,

36:42.350 --> 36:43.750
like, on it.

36:43.752 --> 36:45.752
TYLER: But Merm's the best
deckhand on the fleet,

36:45.820 --> 36:47.821
and if anybody can
pull it off, it's her.

36:47.889 --> 36:51.758
This is where other boats
with three people is huge.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.561
If we can get this one
with just the two of us,

36:54.563 --> 36:56.096
it just shows how good we are.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.498
Come on, let's go, Merm.

36:59.034 --> 37:01.668
Come on!
Let's get this fish.

37:03.705 --> 37:05.338
(reel unspooling rapidly)

37:05.974 --> 37:07.507
We got to get this fish.

37:07.509 --> 37:08.975
MARISSA: All right, Tyler.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.177
Put a little bit
more heat on him.

37:11.179 --> 37:13.513
Running out of time though if
we want to get in before midnight,

37:13.782 --> 37:14.781
so we can fish tomorrow.

37:14.849 --> 37:16.382
TYLER: There's always something.
Always something.

37:16.385 --> 37:17.784
MARISSA: If we
can land this fish,

37:17.852 --> 37:20.653
we still have to rush back
to Gloucester to offload.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.989
We got to make it
happen pretty quickly.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.524
TYLER: It's kind of weird
not having throttles.

37:24.593 --> 37:26.259
This fish could make a
beeline for underneath the boat

37:26.328 --> 37:28.361
at any point in time and
he could break 'em right off.

37:31.199 --> 37:33.600
Oh, oh. I don't like that.
See that waffle?

37:33.602 --> 37:35.335
MARISSA: Coming up again.
TYLER: Tuna. Tuna.

37:35.337 --> 37:36.603
MARISSA: He's right up,
he's right up top.

37:36.605 --> 37:38.404
TYLER: Tuna. Tuna.
MARISSA: Whoa!

37:38.407 --> 37:42.075
TYLER: Oh! He's headshaking bad.
Forward inside to the right.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.711
Run. Run.
Forward to the right.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.548
Other way.

37:48.617 --> 37:50.750
Turn the wheel the
other way, all the way.

37:50.819 --> 37:52.018
No, the other way,
the other way.

37:52.087 --> 37:54.020
Back up a little bit.
No, wait, wait, wait.

37:55.156 --> 37:55.955
Give me a tap.

37:55.958 --> 37:57.023
MARISSA: What?

37:57.025 --> 37:58.091
TYLER: Back up a little bit.

37:58.093 --> 38:00.827
Touch and reverse.
No, nothing, nothing.

38:00.895 --> 38:03.229
Stop. Forward to the left.
No, nothing.

38:03.231 --> 38:04.564
MARISSA: Back up?

38:04.566 --> 38:07.166
TYLER: Yeah, just touch in gear.
Touch in gear.

38:07.169 --> 38:08.969
Coming at the boat. Coming
at the boat. Coming at the boat.

38:09.037 --> 38:09.903
MARISSA: What?

38:09.971 --> 38:11.304
TYLER: Okay! Okay!

38:11.306 --> 38:12.772
MARISSA: Reverse?

38:12.841 --> 38:13.974
(Tyler groans).

38:14.042 --> 38:16.009
TYLER: Stay there.
Just listen to me.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.434
TYLER: Other way.
Turn the wheel the other way.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.469
No, wait, wait, wait.
Give me a tap.

38:26.972 --> 38:27.771
MARISSA: What?

38:27.839 --> 38:28.905
TYLER: Touch in reverse.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.440
No, nothing, nothing. Stop.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.841
No, nothing.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.043
MARISSA: Back up?

38:33.111 --> 38:34.711
TYLER: Yeah, just touch in gear.
Touch in gear.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.512
Coming at the boat. Coming
at the boat. Coming at the boat.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.114
MARISSA: What?

38:38.116 --> 38:40.183
Tyler's out fighting
the fish on the back deck,

38:40.251 --> 38:41.584
and I'm inside running the boat,

38:41.920 --> 38:43.987
because we lost our controls
in the back of the boat.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.389
TYLER: I've never really caught a fish
where the cockpit doesn't have controls.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.590
Come here!

38:49.928 --> 38:51.261
MARISSA: Or just...
TYLER: Yup. Come here.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.462
MARISSA: What?
TYLER: Come here.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.530
This fish has given
us a good fight.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.732
We've seen him a few times.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.266
We need this to maintain our
spot on the leaderboard to try

38:57.269 --> 38:58.368
and stay in the competition.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.470
A one-a-day fishery, you
want to catch a big fish,

39:00.538 --> 39:01.738
90 inches or better,

39:01.740 --> 39:03.540
because then you know you're
gonna have a lot more weight,

39:03.608 --> 39:05.108
you're gonna be
able to get paid.

39:05.127 --> 39:06.476
That's what it's all about.

39:06.544 --> 39:07.877
It's not like it's three
fish a day and we catch

39:07.946 --> 39:08.878
three 80-inchers.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.280
We want to maximize
what we can catch.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.082
We're here to win it this year.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.817
It's Pinwheel or nothing.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.652
Give me the harpoon.

39:16.088 --> 39:17.954
Get on the rod.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.357
Reel, reel, reel,
reel, reel, reel!

39:23.428 --> 39:25.061
MARISSA: Come on, Ty.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.899
TYLER: I think I hit him.
MARISSA: You got him?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.300
Woo-hoo!

39:31.303 --> 39:32.635
TYLER: Woo!
MARISSA: Woo-hoo!

39:32.704 --> 39:34.170
TYLER: I got him.
That was a sick shot.

39:34.239 --> 39:35.572
MARISSA: That was.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.907
TYLER: We got a dart in him,
but it ain't over yet, baby!

39:38.577 --> 39:39.976
Come on!

39:39.978 --> 39:42.112
Tail gaff. Rope!

39:43.448 --> 39:46.649
MARISSA: All right. Got him.
All right. We got him.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.453
TYLER: He's ours.
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

39:50.522 --> 39:52.455
We're still in this thing, baby!

39:52.457 --> 39:55.658
MARISSA: Woo-hoo! Pretty work.
TYLER: Pretty work. Pretty work.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.927
In the boat. Let's go!
We got to get to Gloucester.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.595
Hold on. Hold on.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.798
Down. Nice. Perfect.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.400
MARISSA: Yeah.

40:03.468 --> 40:05.668
TYLER: All right, Merm.
Let's get a measurement.

40:05.870 --> 40:06.870
What do we got, Merm?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.204
MARISSA: 85 inches.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.023
TYLER: Good job.
Let's get him iced up.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.073
Put away.
Put him in the box.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.074
Take care of him.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.209
MARISSA: All right.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.811
TYLER: Yes! Good job.
MARISSA: Good job, Ty.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.279
TYLER: We got to
get to Gloucester.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.414
Good battle.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.616
MARISSA: Woo-hoo!

40:31.763 --> 40:33.997
(boat horn)

40:37.702 --> 40:39.602
DAVE: Perseverance pays off.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.704
PJ: Hello, Dave.
How's it going?

40:41.706 --> 40:43.973
DAVE: First one of the season
and it was a tough one.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.442
PJ: Good for you.
Way to go.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.310
DAVE: Sounds like the
market's back, right?

40:47.312 --> 40:49.045
PJ: A lot better than last year.
That's for sure.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.180
Let's see what it looks like.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.449
DAVE: I would have thought
we would have come out

40:53.452 --> 40:55.518
catching fish and being
on top, but, you know,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.987
sometimes you should have
zigged when you zag.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.389
I know we're gonna catch fish,

40:59.457 --> 41:01.057
and I know we're
gonna make money,

41:01.125 --> 41:02.442
and that's what's important.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.793
What do you got, PJ?

41:03.862 --> 41:06.596
PJ: 321 pounds dressed, Dave.
DAVE: We'll take it. PJ: Nice.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.198
DAVE: For the first fish, right? SANDRO:
Okay. Yeah. DAVE: That's a big one.

41:08.266 --> 41:09.465
SANDRO: It's
better than nothing.

41:09.468 --> 41:10.750
PJ: All right.
Let's see what we got here.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.368
Check this one out.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.139
DAVE: Let's see.
A little red.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.140
PJ: It just needs
a little more fat,

41:18.143 --> 41:19.142
but it's beautiful color.

41:19.210 --> 41:20.877
You know, the inside,
nice cherry red.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.545
It's a little bit
dark on the tail.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.215
DAVE: What do you
think you can do here?

41:27.686 --> 41:30.152
PJ: I can still get you
$13 a pound for it.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.220
SANDRO: Yeah, perfect.

41:31.223 --> 41:32.421
DAVE: That's a good start.
I'll take that.

41:32.424 --> 41:33.490
SANDRO: Yeah.
DAVE: I'll take that. Good.

41:33.558 --> 41:34.624
SANDRO: Much better
than last year.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.692
DAVE: Yeah, right.
It wasn't even half that.

41:36.695 --> 41:37.960
We're gonna go right back out,

41:37.963 --> 41:39.429
and hopefully we can
keep things going.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.763
And we're gonna see
you tomorrow, that's...

41:40.765 --> 41:41.764
PJ: All right.

41:41.783 --> 41:42.899
DAVE: That's what
we're planning on.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.167
PJ: Sounds good. DAVE:
Thanks, PJ. PJ: Thank you.

41:44.235 --> 41:45.768
SANDRO: Appreciate it.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.103
DAVE: We decided to take
the rundown to Chatham.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.304
We were frustrated.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.572
We just couldn't fish the
way we wanted to down there.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.973
We burned quite a bit of fuel,

41:50.976 --> 41:52.175
but we got a decent-sized fish.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.510
We got a good price for it.

41:53.578 --> 41:54.944
We're gonna go out right away,

41:54.963 --> 41:56.646
we're gonna get more
fish and we're gonna give the

41:56.648 --> 41:58.181
other guys a
run for their money.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.919
SANDRO: Fill up the fuel tanks
so we can go again.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.155
DAVE: Definitely got
our work cut out for us.

42:10.728 --> 42:14.864
TYLER: Come on, we got to stick
it to the rest of the fleet.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.199
DENNIS: Well, I'm
glad you guys scored.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.333
TYLER: 85-incher.

42:17.402 --> 42:18.535
DENNIS: That's a
nice marketable size.

42:18.603 --> 42:21.738
Let's get your fish out
and see how it looks.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.274
TYLER: I think Merm and I are
really good as a two-person

42:24.342 --> 42:27.610
crew because it's controlled
chaos on board the Pinwheel.

42:27.612 --> 42:29.362
I feel like that's why,
you know, we get it done.

42:29.414 --> 42:32.281
I really hope we get a
great price for this fish,

42:32.284 --> 42:34.217
because we really
need to stay ahead.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.086
What do you got for a
dress weight, D-bone?

42:37.088 --> 42:39.288
DENNIS:
257 pounds dressed, Tyler.

42:39.291 --> 42:40.957
TYLER: I'll take a
250 dresser all day.

42:40.959 --> 42:41.958
Let's take a look at it.

42:42.026 --> 42:43.793
DENNIS: Right on.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.765
Nice tuna for second
fish of the season.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.167
The color is not as
sharp as your last fish,

42:51.235 --> 42:52.402
but it's got much more fat.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.704
I'd say this is the
fattest fish we've seen in...

42:54.706 --> 42:56.239
TYLER: Really?

42:56.307 --> 42:57.707
DENNIS: Come into
Gloucester this season.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.576
If the core is clear and
no burn, this is a good fish.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.644
TYLER: Let's check
out the core.

43:01.713 --> 43:02.779
DENNIS: Right on.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.614
TYLER: See what we're
working with here.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.917
DENNIS: Right now, the
core looks nice and clear.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.319
TYLER: Yeah, that thing is
beautifully translucent.

43:10.322 --> 43:11.587
Awesome.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.122
DENNIS: Well, you got a really
nice fish here tonight, guys.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.625
MARISSA: What do you think
you can give us per pound?

43:19.397 --> 43:20.529
DENNIS: $16 a pound.

43:20.532 --> 43:22.131
TYLER: Bingo! That's awesome.
MARISSA: That's great.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.599
TYLER: That's a great
fish right there.

43:23.602 --> 43:25.184
Rock on.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.136
DENNIS: Thank you, guys. TYLER: Appreciate
it. Thank you. MARISSA: Thank you, Dennis.

43:27.138 --> 43:28.137
TYLER: We got two
for two on tunas.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.138
We're gonna go get
a third tomorrow.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.006
Later, guys.

43:30.074 --> 43:31.407
We're out. Later. Peace.

43:31.476 --> 43:32.675
MARISSA: Thank you.

43:32.677 --> 43:35.144
TYLER: Later. Tunas.
I'm having fun out there.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.212
It's good fishing.

43:36.214 --> 43:37.947
There's a lot of fish
and they're good quality.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.548
And that's what it's all about.

43:39.551 --> 43:41.017
You know, the prices are
getting back on track.

43:41.085 --> 43:43.285
I'm just hoping to keep the momentum
and try and grind this thing out,

43:43.288 --> 43:44.620
and try to put
pressure on everyone else,

43:44.623 --> 43:45.722
to have to fish hard.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.223
Some guys haven't
even caught and it's

43:47.225 --> 43:48.424
gonna make it interesting.

43:48.426 --> 43:49.959
It seems like Merm and
I always find a way to adapt

43:50.028 --> 43:51.494
and overcome every
situation we get put in.

43:51.562 --> 43:54.230
We just got to keep on
fishing every single day.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.232
Man, we got lucky
this afternoon.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.001
All right, Mermy.
Let's do it.

43:58.036 --> 43:59.235
There's something wrong
with our throttles.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.237
We got to figure
out how to fix it.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.173
<i>NARRATOR: With a
high-quality catch,</i>
