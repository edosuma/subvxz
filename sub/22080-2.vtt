00:08.633 --> 00:09.926
[birds chirping]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.302
-[sighs]
-[knocking on door]

00:11.386 --> 00:13.054
Jessi, what's taking so long?

00:13.138 --> 00:15.473
I feel gross and nothing looks good.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.685
Oh, honey, that's how the fashion industry
wants you to feel,

00:18.768 --> 00:20.854
so you spend all your money
at Forever 21

00:20.937 --> 00:24.983
on clothes made by Malaysian toddlers,
who smoke, by the way.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.902
Why don't you just wear the white shorts?
You always look so cute in them.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.779
Mom, you think I look cute in everything.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.533
No, I don't. You wear some things
I find very unflattering.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.536
So, what's the deal with you and Jessi?

00:36.619 --> 00:39.080
Have you seen her
since, you know, the kiss?

00:39.164 --> 00:40.957
Yeah. I sent her a text that said "Hey,"

00:41.041 --> 00:43.501
she sent me a video of a dog
dressed like a fisherman.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.254
-Oh, my God. I guess she likes you?
-I think so.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.215
I mean, the dog had a hat
and a raincoat, tiny fishing pole--

00:49.299 --> 00:51.843
-No, I've seen it.
-Fun and playful, but also--

00:51.926 --> 00:54.345
-You don't send it lightly.
-Still figuring out what to send back.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.514
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Tell him to send a dick pic.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.559
Girls love that,
especially when it comes out of nowhere

00:59.642 --> 01:01.186
with, like, zero context.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.388
God, I love field trip day!

01:37.472 --> 01:40.350
Can't wait to see which one of these dopes
forgot their permission slip.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.644
And you two, Devin and Devin,

01:42.727 --> 01:45.104
-aka the Devins.
-We're the Devins.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.899
You look great as always,
you post-racial power couple.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.819
-It's like genuinely not a big deal.
-Hey, guys.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.863
Speaking of couples, Nick,
what's the deal with you and Jessi?

01:53.947 --> 01:57.200
-Being in a relationship is so magical.
-Are y'all dating or what?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.451
-Uh...
-Uh!

01:58.535 --> 02:00.829
Listen to me, Nick,
you're a cute little nugget.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.706
You're funny, sometimes,
but you're tiny and you need a hook.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.252
-Cute and funny seems like a decent hook.
-Jessi's on the rise.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.629
Smart girls are having a moment, for now.

02:09.712 --> 02:11.548
Frankly I'm not even sure
what she sees in you.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.300
A lot of Nick's appeal is revealed
the more you get to know him.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.595
-Huh! And then there's this one.
-I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.515
You and Male Lesbian
are middle-of-the-bus people.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.143
Want to make it to the back?
Lock it down with Jessi

02:23.226 --> 02:25.562
and lose "Billie Jean King."

02:25.645 --> 02:27.522
Look who's arrived.

02:27.605 --> 02:31.651
Your booty is bangin'
in those white shorts, you little fox.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.862
Really? They were my male cousin's.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.489
-Jessi, hey.
-Hi. Oh--!

02:36.573 --> 02:38.116
-Oh, a hug?
-Yeah, or...

02:38.199 --> 02:41.369
-No, I mean, yeah, we could do that, or...
-How about-- Is this...?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.955
-What if we did like a whirr...?
-Oh, is...?

02:44.038 --> 02:44.914
Ta-da!

02:44.998 --> 02:48.376
That's so sweet.
Look how awkward they are.

02:48.459 --> 02:52.672
Yeah. Yeah, I can see this.
It's not for me but people will like it.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.299
It's Starbucks. It's what America wants.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.593
So what's the deal?
Are y'all a couple, or what?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.476
Oh, shit, what these motherfuckers
gonna  do?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.729
-So what's the deal, you two?
-Um...

03:07.812 --> 03:09.981
I-- I think maybe...

03:10.064 --> 03:12.150
-Yes, we're dating?
-Yeah.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.068
[cheering]

03:15.153 --> 03:17.113
Whoa, everyone's couplin' up.

03:17.196 --> 03:20.658
Nick and Jessi, my mom
and her hospice nurse Roberto.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.576
[laughing]

03:21.659 --> 03:22.911
Love is in the air.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.579
Okay, so, what are we thinking?

03:24.662 --> 03:27.373
Find the first seat that doesn't have
a swastika carved in the back?

03:27.457 --> 03:30.501
Eh, Nicky, in the back, man.
We're back here. Couples in the back.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.880
Oh.
I guess we're supposed to sit together?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.590
-At the back of the bus?
-Yeah.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.842
-Oh.
-Oh, are you cool with that?

03:37.926 --> 03:39.260
Yeah, surely.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.554
I mean, the back of the bus
is for couples,

03:41.638 --> 03:43.139
and of course that wheelchair kid

03:43.223 --> 03:45.350
so that the cool kids
don't get in trouble for exclusion.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.603
Also, they need to load
this little motherfucker from the back.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.105
You know, I could walk
until I was vaccinated.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.025
Jessi, Nick, hi.
Are you guys joining us?

03:54.108 --> 03:58.529
Go! I'll be fine.
Just remember everything that happens...

03:58.613 --> 04:01.032
-Later, Andrew.
-...so you can tell me later.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.743
-Milady.
-Thank you, good sir.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.205
Okay, this is a good thing, sweetheart.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.667
-I do not like when you call me that.
-Now you can sit next to a girl,

04:10.750 --> 04:12.961
outside thigh against outside thigh,

04:13.044 --> 04:15.463
tip of elbow
against bottom corner of boob.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.465
Your buddy Jay over there
has got the idea.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.467
-Is this your card?
-No.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.678
-Fuck!
-Maybe it is my card?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.013
[yells]
Why won't you go out with me?!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.098
Come on, come on, come on.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.724
Get your ass in a seat
before it's too late.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.269
No, no, no, no. Don't sit with the kid
with the rolly backpack.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.896
-He can't read social cues.
-Hi, you're looking at me.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.982
How tall are you?
There's a monster next to you.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.316
Eh, what's up, Caleb?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.152
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sit with her.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.406
Remember when she made you
jizz your pants at the dance?

04:41.489 --> 04:44.367
No, I forgot when I publicly ejaculated.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.077
-Really?
-No. I'm never gonna forget that.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.912
[distorted groaning]

04:50.373 --> 04:52.959
Come on, she has no idea what happened.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.378
And besides, you don't know
what's in that backpack.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.131
Ooh...!
I bet it's filled to the brim with dildos.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.633
Hey, Andrew, do you wanna play
Travel Scrabble?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.093
Oh!
[chuckles]

05:02.176 --> 05:04.262
She wants it so bad.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.515
Jesus, Andrew, if you don't find
a seat soon we're gonna get stuck with--

05:07.598 --> 05:11.311
-Cop a squat, my dude.
-[howls] No!

05:11.394 --> 05:12.979
Oh, fuck a duck.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.481
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go fuck a duck.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.567
So what's the deal, Andrew?
You dating anyone?

05:17.650 --> 05:21.195
I'm personally, not currently,
or really in the past,

05:21.279 --> 05:24.115
but, well, there is one woman in my life.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.118
She's rusty green
and she's a thousand feet tall,

05:27.201 --> 05:29.245
AKA the Statue of Liberty,

05:29.329 --> 05:32.540
AKA where we're going
on our class trip today, kiddo.

05:32.623 --> 05:37.503
AKA another example
of American mythmaking, gang.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.882
We stole this entire country
from the Native Americans.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.218
Oh, my God, he's so  deep!

05:44.302 --> 05:48.473
Okay, first of all, the Indians gave us
this country for Thanksgiving, okay?

05:48.556 --> 05:51.350
So no backsies,
they can't be Indian givers.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.687
-Pun intended, so... [chuckles]
-[moans] Okay.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.235
So, back of the bus, huh?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.654
-VIP.
-Can I get you something to drink?

06:03.738 --> 06:07.075
-Orange juice, champagne?
-They have beverage service back here?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.327
No, no, no, no, no.
He's the bus driver's son. He's insane.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.163
We'll be offering warm cookies
when we arrive at the statue,

06:12.246 --> 06:14.874
so don't fill up on bread.
[chuckles]

06:16.084 --> 06:17.668
[slurping, moaning]

06:17.752 --> 06:19.962
So you guys gonna
tongue each other or what?

06:20.046 --> 06:22.632
Oh--!
Are we supposed to be doing  that?

06:22.715 --> 06:24.884
We don't have to if we don't want to.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.137
Yeah. It just feels early in the morning
to be making out.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.264
-Yeah. No, I hear you.
-[male Devin] Mm, yeah.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.475
You taste like birthday cake Pop-Tarts.

06:32.558 --> 06:36.312
I'm actually good
with, like, a light hand-hold.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.522
-Great.
-Good.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.565
Why didn't you guys get champagne?
It's free.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.113
-Come on, Nick, I'll race you to the top.
-Boys go with boys,

06:45.196 --> 06:47.865
and girls go with girls.
That way we can talk about each other

06:47.949 --> 06:50.284
and then we'll meet at the top
for couples pics!

06:50.368 --> 06:52.703
-That sound good to you?
-Couples pics?

06:52.787 --> 06:54.956
Don't you remember last week
when we made fun of people

06:55.039 --> 06:56.374
with shared Instagram accounts?

06:56.457 --> 06:59.335
I do, I do.
But my thinking on that has evolved.

06:59.418 --> 07:04.882
Uh, okay. I guess I'll see you up there
for a... "couples pic."

07:09.303 --> 07:11.264
Did that little bastard just ditch you?

07:11.347 --> 07:14.225
Well, I guess he's supposed to hang out
with his couple friends.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.270
Yeah, pretty soon I bet
they'll all be swinging together,

07:17.353 --> 07:19.188
just a big old fuck and suck.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.357
Maybe you can be the guy
who jerks off in the corner.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.986
Every orgy needs a witness
and baby wipes.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.363
So, does Nick know
when your birthday is?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.990
Uh, I guess.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.659
Oh, sweetie, it's your most important
couple holiday.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.996
Devin, can I talk to you,
like,  in private?

07:35.079 --> 07:39.876
Okay, Lola. Wow. She gets so jealous
when I talk to, like, anything.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.380
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[Andrew sighs]

07:44.464 --> 07:47.258
It comes to this.
Jay! What's up?

07:47.341 --> 07:49.844
-Should we climb this gal together?
-Can't talk right now.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.805
I'm centering myself
before my greatest trick yet.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.599
-Okay.
-What trick, you ask?

07:54.682 --> 07:58.102
By day's end, I will replicate
my fifth favorite magician

07:58.186 --> 08:00.313
David Copperfield's famous illusion--

08:00.396 --> 08:04.775
I will make
the Statue of Liberty  disappear.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.695
-You got eyes on that little brown kid?
-Course I do. He's a little brown kid.

08:07.778 --> 08:11.240
Okay, well, maybe I can help you
with your trick.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.826
What the hell? Why does everyone
keep ditching me?

08:13.910 --> 08:16.370
Because you smell like an Israeli disco.

08:17.246 --> 08:20.958
So what exactly does a boyfriend do?
Like, what are my responsibilities?

08:21.042 --> 08:24.212
You just gotta be there for her, you know?
Before class, after class,

08:24.295 --> 08:26.631
lunchtime, bedtime--
you're never off the clock, really.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.008
-Isn't that exhausting?
-I'm telling you, bro, it's great.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.801
You just have to make
a couple of compromises.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.679
-Like what?
-For example, my name is actually  Devon,

08:33.763 --> 08:35.806
but she makes me go by "Devin"
so we match.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.435
Oh, right, it's Devon.
I don't know if I could change my name.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.646
You'll get used to it, Jesse.
See that? I flipped it.

08:41.729 --> 08:42.563
I see now.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.316
Hey, there you are.
Have you seen Nick?

08:45.399 --> 08:48.110
-Ugh. We're not married.
-But you are dating, right?

08:48.194 --> 08:51.948
I guess. I mean, we kissed,
we texted twice,

08:52.031 --> 08:54.700
then suddenly we're sitting
in the back of the bus with the couples.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.786
-And that wheelchair kid.
-Who was drunk.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.955
I heard you sent Nick
a dog fisherman.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.957
He told you that?
What else did he tell you?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.834
-Oh, I don't know if I should say.
-Andrew, it's just me.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.797
No, I know, but now you're,
you know, "my friend's lady."

09:07.880 --> 09:11.259
Ugh! I'm not a lady.
You know what? Forget I said anything.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.718
-Hey, Jessi--
-What?!

09:12.802 --> 09:15.805
Oh-- I think you sat in ice cream...?

09:17.807 --> 09:18.808
[gasps]

09:19.225 --> 09:21.978
I also sat in ice cream.
We're the same.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.063
I've got to go to the bathroom
right now.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.732
Wait, are you okay?
I-I can come with you.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.486
Actually, I sat in ice cream on purpose.
I was trying to cool down.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.781
Oh, I feel you, buddy.
I have a super dry tongue. Look.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.782
Ah-hh!

09:34.865 --> 09:38.869
Actually, I have to wet it manually
every hour. It's a real nightmare.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.665
Upside, I get to eat a lot
of Rocket Pops, so yin-yang.

09:44.500 --> 09:48.713
Uh, Jessi, are you okay?
Should I get Coach Steve or a grownup?

09:48.796 --> 09:51.340
I'm fine.  Do not  get Coach Steve.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.469
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not happening.

09:55.553 --> 10:00.891
I just got my first period
in the fucking Statue of Liberty.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.604
Okay, I just need
to find something to...

10:04.687 --> 10:06.439
What the hell?

10:06.939 --> 10:09.191
Oh, my God, this is the worst.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.196
What sadistic female-hating janitor
stocks this bathroom?

10:14.280 --> 10:18.951
You leave me, Svetlana,
I fuck your whole gender!

10:19.035 --> 10:22.246
Jessi, what's going on in there?
Oh, my God, are you a drug mule?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.206
Did your heroin balloon
burst inside your body?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.374
Say something, anything.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.503
[sighs] Actually, Andrew,
can you come in here?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.088
-Am I allowed?
-Just get in here!

10:33.049 --> 10:35.843
Oh. It's the same.
Look, What's going on?

10:35.926 --> 10:38.429
Okay, I would never tell a guy this,

10:38.512 --> 10:40.890
-but since it's just you...
-Hurtful. Continue.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.684
-...I got my period.
-[retches]

10:43.893 --> 10:45.853
I'm so sorry-- [retches]

10:46.937 --> 10:49.523
Whew.
Could you pass me some toilet paper?

10:49.607 --> 10:51.108
[Jessi] There isn't any!

10:53.778 --> 10:56.530
Missy, have you seen Jessi?
We were supposed to meet up here.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.492
Uh, no, I haven't,
but if you look over there...

10:59.575 --> 11:01.702
-Missy.
-...you can see Ellis Island,

11:01.786 --> 11:05.039
the entryway for generations
of "huddled masses."

11:05.122 --> 11:06.832
-Just--
-Lots of people who were turned away

11:06.916 --> 11:09.919
because of an eye disease
that they didn't even know they had.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.754
Okay, so that's a no on Jessi?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.089
[Coach whistling]

11:13.255 --> 11:15.299
Look at her, she's the American dream.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.886
I mean, she started from the bottom
of the sea, built herself up from nothing,

11:18.969 --> 11:21.597
and now she's this big huge statue.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.392
Actually, she was a gift from the French.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.519
Typical imperialist patriarchy.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.063
Okay, there's no way
Lady Liberty's French.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.273
They did not teach me that
at Fordham University.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.608
-Where'd you go?
-Ahem, Apex Tech.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.652
-I'm sorry. Where?
-Full disclosure-- The Learning Annex.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.737
-Where was it?
-Truth be told, the Internet.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.322
-I can't read.
-Hmm. I didn't think so.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.200
Now look at me
like you can't believe we're together.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.786
-Guys, do you know where Jessi is?
-You don't know?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.454
Check your back pocket.
Is her hand in there?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.748
I saw her go into the bathroom
with Andrew G.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.794
The following is a list of other people
I saw go into the bathroom today--

11:51.877 --> 11:54.338
Eric L., Kevin B., Sasha S.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.007
Whoa! Sasha made the list. All right!

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God. Does it hurt?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.430
-Well, it doesn't feel good.
-I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

12:02.513 --> 12:06.267
Just go to the gift shop and see
if they have any... feminine products.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.186
Okay, great. Should I keep a receipt,
and you reimburse me later?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.856
-Blood is coming out of my vagina!
-Okay, then, my treat.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.607
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

12:13.691 --> 12:15.693
What am I gonna do?

12:16.610 --> 12:17.611
[screams]

12:20.156 --> 12:21.490
[speaking with French accent]
Hello, Jessi.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.826
As the largest woman in the world,

12:23.909 --> 12:27.163
I welcome you into the covenant
of menstruation.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.582
Oh, thank God, a woman.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.918
I'm so scared right now.
There's so much blood.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.253
Am I gonna be okay?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.922
Being a woman is misery.

12:37.006 --> 12:41.218
Nothing but pain and unwanted babies
from terrible lovers,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.012
and worst of all,  le cramp.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.432
Ugh. What if I don't want to be a woman?
I like how I am now.

12:46.515 --> 12:50.019
Change, it comes
whether you want it or not,

12:50.102 --> 12:55.024
like disgusting pigeons who defecate
and fornicate on your shoulder.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.568
[coughing]
You're kind of a bummer.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.738
Oh, well, I'm so sorry
I'm not more American,

13:00.905 --> 13:03.991
sunny Mickey Mouse baba-booey bullshit.

13:04.074 --> 13:08.496
You are a woman now, Jessi,
and nothing will ever be the same again.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.582
Jesus. Is there anything good
about being a woman?

13:11.665 --> 13:16.712
If you're very lucky a man
will jack off at you on the subway,

13:16.795 --> 13:18.130
so,  no.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.343
Empty your pockets, Aladdin Bin Laden.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.721
Guys, guys, I really wasn't going to make
the Statue of Liberty disappear.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.141
Well, well, well. What were you
planning on doing with these?

13:29.225 --> 13:32.937
Aw, those are just for a magic trick.
I can prove it. May I?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.148
-[fizzes]
-[both] Whoa!

13:36.232 --> 13:38.943
Wow! You're the most talented person
I ever met!

13:39.026 --> 13:42.154
Not to name drop, but we brought
Hoda Kotb here one time.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.909
Hoda Kotb, from the drunk ladies' hour
of the  Today Show?  Wow.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.162
-What else can you do?
-Well, before I do any more tricks,

13:50.246 --> 13:52.998
I'll have to get out of my handcuffs!

13:53.499 --> 13:55.042
-Wow!
-Oh, man!

13:55.125 --> 13:57.461
-Wait a minute. Did we cuff him?
-No, you didn't.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.671
I brought these from home.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.590
You never know when
you're gonna really need to wow someone.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.759
This kid's so much cooler than Kal Penn.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.220
[thin guard] Oh, yeah. Kal Penn
can straight up go fuck himself.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.722
-Yeah, fuck Kal Penn!
-[fat guard] Guys, that's too far.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.017
Are you there, Jessi?
It's me, Andrew.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.061
-I get it, Andrew.
-I was hoping you would.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.646
-Did you find something?
-I did.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.859
Are you kidding? What am I
supposed to do with this thing?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.861
-It's huge.
-And I apologize.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.612
It was either this or a Yankee pennant,

14:23.696 --> 14:27.116
and I just felt uncomfortable with you
having the Yankees so close to your...

14:27.199 --> 14:29.368
blessing, 'cause, you know,
"Let's go, Mets."

14:29.451 --> 14:31.871
-Let's go, Mets.
-[woman] Let's go, Mets!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.706
-[Jessi] Someone else is in here now.
-[woman grunting]

14:33.789 --> 14:35.499
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Let's go, Mets.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.002
[woman grunting]
Let's go, Mets!

14:38.085 --> 14:39.086
[clicking]

14:39.587 --> 14:42.298
-What's your problem, babe?
-It's not a problem.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.801
I'm just asking you
not to hashtag our photo "The Devins."

14:45.885 --> 14:48.345
-Devin, but why?
-Because my name is  Devon!

14:49.805 --> 14:53.267
I can't believe I'm wearing
a 9/11 towel as a diaper

14:53.350 --> 14:54.643
and I wore white shorts

14:54.727 --> 14:57.396
on the  worst  day in history
to wear white shorts.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.065
Here, for your-- you know,
"ice cream butt."

15:00.149 --> 15:01.984
Thanks. You're a good friend.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.237
What? What are they doing?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.698
Tsk, tsk. Oh, let me guess.
You're looking at Andrew and Jessi?

15:07.781 --> 15:10.993
-Why do you have binoculars?
-Because tourists are hilarious.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.246
Tilt to the right if you wanna see
a grown man in a Minions T-shirt.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.164
[sniffing]

15:15.247 --> 15:17.917
-What is that? You smell that?
-I don't smell anything.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.212
-[gasps] That's period blood.
-Oh, my God, you're a really bad guy.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.341
This is blood lust, Andrew,
literal blood lust.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.301
-Only one thing to do.
-Do not say--

15:27.384 --> 15:29.178
-Fuck her face!
-What you just said.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.931
Promise all of this
stays between you and me?

15:32.014 --> 15:36.393
Of course, just you and me
and that gigantic 9/11 towel.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.479
-Never forget.
-[woman in restroom] "Never forget"!

15:38.562 --> 15:43.108
The key is to trust
that the right card will appear

15:43.192 --> 15:45.736
when you need it most!

15:45.819 --> 15:47.821
-Is this your card?
-[fat guard] That's my signature.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.865
-That's amazing.
-Oh, man.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.992
You're free to go, buddy.
You're too good.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.452
Magic is the best!

15:53.535 --> 15:55.955
I live alone and have nothing
and no one.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.209
Jessi, what the hell? You were supposed
to meet me in the head.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
I actually think it's the crown,
or is it a visor?

16:02.544 --> 16:04.380
Whatever, Andrew.
I thought we were going out.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.882
-There are rules to this.
-Who gives a shit about the rules?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.759
I do! I was up there all alone.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.719
I looked like an idiot
in front of the Devins.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.888
-Nick, go easy on her.
-Why are you taking her side?

16:12.972 --> 16:16.100
I'm not taking anyone's side.
I just want us all to be friends,

16:16.183 --> 16:18.644
and you were off hanging with Devon,
so I was trying to help Jessi.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.229
-Help her with what?
-Nothing.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.731
-I saw you hugging her.
-That's only 'cause--

16:22.815 --> 16:24.525
-'Cause what, Andrew?
-'Cause she got her period!

16:24.608 --> 16:26.443
-Andrew!
-[stammers]

16:26.527 --> 16:28.779
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry for what?

16:28.862 --> 16:31.991
-Sorry you got your period?
-Don't be sorry.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.368
It's not a disease, it's totally normal.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.287
And I know nobody talks about it
but everyone gets their period

16:37.371 --> 16:41.667
and now I got mine,
in white fucking shorts!

16:41.750 --> 16:42.751
-[voice echoes]
-[gulls fluttering]

16:42.835 --> 16:45.838
Oh, my God.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.132
I'm above this,
so I'm not gonna comment.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.259
Jessi's ice cream was menstrual blood.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.636
But I will say this--
I need some fresh air

16:52.720 --> 16:55.222
because this is Terry  Gross.

16:55.305 --> 16:59.268
Whoa. This is a nightmare.
This is what we're all afraid of.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.103
Again, I'm gonna stay out of this,

17:01.186 --> 17:04.773
but it was less of a period
and more of an exclamation point.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.651
And worst of all, bitch wore white shorts.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.320
That's right, I made it off the bus.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.282
I rode on Missy's
little square-ass backpack.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.286
You guys, you guys,
I just had the best day ever.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.289
[laughing]
Hey, Jessi, what's this behind your ear?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.082
[mutters]
Not now, Jay, I am not in the mood.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.543
Oh, what are you, on your perio-- ulp!

Did you make it to the bathroom
in time, Steve?

19:02.766 --> 19:05.769
Uh, yeah, but it was like-- whew--
right at the buzzer.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.190
Here you go, kiddo, for your...
you know, ahem, your lady issues.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.692
Thanks, Coach Steve.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.945
Uh, these are marshmallows.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.739
You know, I can't read,
so I go by pictures.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.243
All right. Well, either way,
uh, that was very noble of you.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.954
Not that noble. I also took a huge dump.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.457
-It was right at the buzzer--
-I heard you say that to Mr. Lizer.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.585
-It was coming out as I was sitting down.
-Got it!

19:29.668 --> 19:32.129
You know, like when a meerkat comes up
through the prairie,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.298
but let's say it's in Australia
so it's upside down--

19:34.381 --> 19:35.382
Information received.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.678
Baby, uh, I'm sorry about before.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.305
You can tag the picture however you want.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.183
Oh, sweetie, thank you.
I already did.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.392
[slurping, Devon moaning]

19:46.185 --> 19:48.979
-I'm sorry about before, too.
-Okay.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.856
Is that it? You still sound mad.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.942
Oh... I'm gonna go home
and burn my shorts.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.485
That makes two of us.
[chuckles]

19:55.569 --> 19:59.114
I was dishonest before
about beating the buzzer, so...

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
-How was your day, sweetie?
-[gasps]

20:03.702 --> 20:05.704
[whines, sobs]

20:05.787 --> 20:08.415
Aw, Jessi bear, what's wrong?

20:08.498 --> 20:11.210
-[whining] I got my period.
-Oh, you got your period.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.544
[whining]
You made me wear white shorts.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.713
-Oh, I made you wear white shorts.
-[whining]

20:14.796 --> 20:17.925
-I'm so sorry.
-[sobbing]

20:18.926 --> 20:21.845
And then I scared the hell out of a cat.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.513
[laughing]

20:23.597 --> 20:26.433
-How was your day?
-To be honest with you, Duke, not great.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.353
My girlfriend got her period
and then she got really mad at me.

20:29.436 --> 20:33.315
Sounds like we both got pussy problems.
[laughing]

20:33.398 --> 20:36.318
-Duke, you're not being helpful.
-Relax, Nick.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.820
This period hullabaloo will pass,

20:38.904 --> 20:42.449
but then it will come again,
and again, and again,

Did you know that tampons
are taxed as a luxury item?

21:02.344 --> 21:05.722
Yeah. It's a real luxury to stick
a wad of cotton up your crotch.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.891
Could you please just tell me
how to use a tampon?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.978

Honey, you're not ready for tampons.

Let's finish basic training

It's really honestly crazy.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.843
I mean, what would you do if blood
came out of your penis once a month?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.886
Oh, my! I don't know!

21:44.970 --> 21:47.097
Why would you put that image
in my head?

21:47.180 --> 21:50.058
-What would you do?
-One time I ate a bunch of roasted beets

21:50.142 --> 21:51.893
and then when I pooped, it was red,

21:51.977 --> 21:55.105
and I thought my butt was bleeding
and I was like, "Oh, no."

-Right.
-And then I was like,

21:56.690 --> 22:00.902
-"Oh, yeah, I ate beets," so...
-I don't think that's the same.

was pretty big.

good old Jessi anymore?

No, no, she's always gonna be
good old Jessi.
