00:01.419 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.381
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.634
So, tell me, are your people aware

00:08.801 --> 00:10.761
they're harbouring a murderer, or do they
just not care?

00:10.928 --> 00:14.181
Gabe doesn't know about the night job.
And he never will. Understood?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.851
Dr Lucy Bauer. Joseph's wife.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.395
<i>We could've been in there for hours.</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:24.859
- We have been in there for years.
- We shouldn't have used the Darkhold.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.611
<i>This is all because of your obsession
with that damn book.</i>

00:27.737 --> 00:29.405
<i>I don't know what it is
but I do know</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:32.116
<i>that it's in all of our best interests
to keep it out of the wrong hands.</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:34.952
<i>- What does she want with him?
- We are going to fix me</i>

00:35.119 --> 00:37.163
and then finish what we started.

01:03.022 --> 01:04.690
Everyone make their final crosscheck.

01:04.774 --> 01:05.775
Hand me that cable?

01:06.150 --> 01:10.571
I just got your message. How?
We're months away from a beta test.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.740
Joe had a breakthrough.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.997
- Where did that come from?
- I built it.

01:20.539 --> 01:23.125
It's the secret sauce
that we've been missing.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.102
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.604
Okay.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.818
Thanks. I feel so much better knowing
that if I die in a fiery explosion,

01:48.984 --> 01:50.694
my eyeballs will survive.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.875
No. Maybe we need more power.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.589
Is everyone okay?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.945
- What? Is that...
- Carbon.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.282
- That's impossible.
- Not anymore.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.287
Nothing is.

02:43.205 --> 02:47.793
See, it gets absorbed into here, okay?
And then it gets broken down

02:48.043 --> 02:52.590
and-- and stored in a quantum state.
Now it can be kept indefinitely,

02:52.882 --> 02:55.551
or it can be discharged back
into the chamber

02:55.718 --> 02:57.928
and converted into matter.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.557
Think of it as a quantum power cell.

03:01.724 --> 03:04.268
- I don't know how you made the leap.
- It's beyond belief.

03:04.727 --> 03:07.521
Well, before we publish, we're gonna need
to replicate the cube

03:07.688 --> 03:11.066
and scale up the chamber, but if
my calculations are correct,

03:11.233 --> 03:15.112
I mean, we're gonna be able
to eventually create complex compounds,

03:15.279 --> 03:17.948
and then organic materials, wheat, rice.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.784
I mean, who knows?
Maybe we can even end starvation.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.833
Hey.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.252
Hey, it doesn't add up.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.047
There was more energy at the end
of the experiment

03:33.172 --> 03:36.300
- than there was at the beginning.
- Yes. That's the genius of it.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.428
But it violates the first law
of thermodynamics. I mean,

03:39.970 --> 03:43.724
- how do you create matter from nothing?
- We had help.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.981
- A book. It showed us...
- What? Wait, wh... what book?

03:51.232 --> 03:52.483
Uh. Sweetie,

03:53.067 --> 03:56.195
um, maybe we've done enough celebrating
for tonight, huh?

03:56.362 --> 03:59.740
Hey, Joe, what's this book she's talking
about? I mean, maybe we can we see it.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.991
It's mine.

04:04.578 --> 04:09.333
You just do whatever I tell you to do,
and everything's gonna work out fine.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.803
Agents down.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.357
<i>Lucy Bauer was here
but she's long gone.</i>

04:33.607 --> 04:36.235
Wait. Hold, uh, Agent May, can you go back
and give me another look

04:36.402 --> 04:38.028
at where the cables connect
to the chamber?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.238
Sure.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.660
Yeah, okay, that's... that's...
that's definitely different from before.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.704
There's a number of pieces missing.
She must have taken them.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.455
She already has the book, the power cells.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.959
<i>My guess is she's trying to replicate
the experiment and reverse the process.</i>

04:52.126 --> 04:54.962
- Un-ghost herself.
- Is that why she took Eli Morrow?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.797
He's part
of her original dream team.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.966
Maybe she needs him to do something
she can't.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.802
What? Show her face
without scaring children?

05:02.136 --> 05:06.140
The Momentum facility is controlled by us
now, so she needs a new place to work.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.809
We need to find her
before someone else gets hurt.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.438
Hey, Mr Canelo, it's, uh, Gabriel Reyes.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.607
I was just wondering if Robbie showed up
to work this morning.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.446
No, he... he took the Charger
a few days ago. I haven't heard from him.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.824
Oh, no, I... I... I tried. I just...

05:25.117 --> 05:27.703
Gabe? It's Daisy Johnson.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.247
Can I call you back?

05:40.299 --> 05:41.175
Where's my brother?

05:42.468 --> 05:46.096
- I'm here to take you to him.
- How come he didn't come? Or call?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.432
I think it'd be better if you heard it
from him.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.309
If you think I'm just gonna get in
some car and...

05:54.813 --> 05:56.523
Who said anything about a car?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.485
Can't you just send Nathanson?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.862
Hmm, it's not so much a request
as an assignment.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.324
A top-secret, very classified,
"for your eyes and ears only" assignment.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.618
But I thought the new S.H.I.E.L.D.
was transparent,

06:07.785 --> 06:10.746
limited only by your colourful spectrum
of security.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.166
That's mostly true, uh,
but this assignment isn't coming from me

06:14.333 --> 06:15.626
or anyone else within S.H.I.E.L.D.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.003
It's a favour for
the United States government.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.633
Could you be more specific
about the details of this assignment?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.427
Only that, as the leading scientific
authority on Inhumans,

06:25.594 --> 06:29.348
your expertise has been requested
by people at the very highest levels.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.435
Agent Simmons, I'm sure you can appreciate
that cooperation with the U.S. government

06:33.602 --> 06:36.980
is crucial as we begin a new era here
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

06:37.523 --> 06:42.569
So please, help me, help the USA,
help us.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.490
Fine. I'll go. Just give me a few hours
to pack, gather my equipment,

06:46.657 --> 06:49.535
- and tie up some loose ends.
- Uh. I guess I wasn't clear.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.703
You have to leave now.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.666
- Can you at least tell me where...
- The Quinjet is ready, sir.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.708
Hmm.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.212
- Oh. We're going together.
- No. The Quinjet's for me.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.340
I have my own mission.
Uh, but this is for you.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.807
- "A team that trusts is a team..."
- Don't.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.608
- Robbie.
- Hey, what's up, man?

07:22.609 --> 07:26.321
Look, yeah, sorry about all the drama.
I'm just glad to see you're safe.

07:26.697 --> 07:29.491
Me? What about you,
disappearing like that?

07:29.741 --> 07:32.119
- I thought you trusted me.
- Well, I do.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.289
Then why are you hiding such a big secret?

07:36.540 --> 07:40.043
- I didn't tell him anything.
- She doesn't have to.

07:40.544 --> 07:44.590
I can do the math. The nights you're
away, the blood on your clothes. Now this?

07:48.427 --> 07:50.137
I wanted to tell you...

07:52.848 --> 07:54.141
for a long time.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.101
It's just...

07:57.436 --> 07:58.812
how do you tell your brother
that you're a...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.314
A secret agent?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.692
You know, he wanted to, but he couldn't.

08:04.318 --> 08:08.655
He took an oath,
'cause, well, it's a secret.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.785
Hey, I... I get it. This is...

08:15.120 --> 08:18.832
super-dope. And kind of a relief.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.418
Sometimes I'd find blood in the sink.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.338
- I was afraid it was something else.
- Like what?

08:25.297 --> 08:26.840
Something bad.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.595
Well, you can relax now that you know
the truth.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.639
How come you're telling me now?

08:33.889 --> 08:36.140
We had to bring you in
for your protection.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.893
<i>Tío</i> got snatched out of prison.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.270
We were worried that the person who took
him might try to grab you for leverage.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.565
But the important thing is
that you're safe now,

08:43.732 --> 08:46.527
and we're gonna find your Uncle Eli.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.489
- This chamber should work.
- Yes.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.658
But it's these power cells
that'll save me.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.703
- What's the book telling you?
- Why the experiment failed before.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.540
It didn't fail. It was sabotaged.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.668
Even if Joe had completed it,
there wasn't enough power.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.879
That's why we're here, isn't it?

09:06.129 --> 09:09.091
This facility can generate close
to 20,000 megawatts.

09:09.299 --> 09:13.554
You realise that if anything goes wrong,
thousands could die.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.348
Not my problem.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.644
Any updates on Lucy Bauer and Eli Morrow?

09:20.811 --> 09:22.521
No, sir, but there's a Quinjet
approaching.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.064
<i>Agent Coulson,</i>

09:24.147 --> 09:25.732
<i>this is Director Jeffrey Mace.</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:29.111
<i>You're harbouring two fugitives,
the Inhuman known as Quake</i>

09:29.278 --> 09:31.863
<i>and an enhanced individual
who can control fire.</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:33.865
I'm here to take them into custody.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.702
Prepare to be boarded.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.213
Jeff.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.048
Phil.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.554
As a former Director, I have
a better sense than most

09:55.679 --> 09:56.972
at how precious your time is.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.809
How important it is to prioritise
the critical from the trivial.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.895
Which makes me wonder why you'd waste
half a day flying here

10:04.104 --> 10:05.147
on a wild goose chase.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.566
Oh, it's not a wild goose chase
if there are geese.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.360
- Do you deny they're on board?
- Geese?

10:10.819 --> 10:13.322
I have zero geese. We are goose-free.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.367
Find them.

10:21.538 --> 10:25.125
Into the containment module, now!
The new Director boarded with a Tac Team,

10:25.250 --> 10:26.627
and he wants to take you both
into custody.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.171
- What? Why?
- Why? Really? Just get in the damn box.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.298
- You, too, Ironside!
- Hey, screw you, Black Kojak!

10:31.465 --> 10:32.966
No one moves this thing except for me!

10:38.472 --> 10:42.434
I like this kid. Look, no offense,
but you can't be here, any of you.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.603
Going down.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.022
- You know what a hero is?
- You really gonna do this?

10:47.230 --> 10:51.109
Everybody loves Han Solo.
Rebel, rule-breaker, a lone wolf.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.779
But to my old-fashioned sensibilities,
he's not a hero.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.822
He's just a guy who always puts
himself first.

10:55.989 --> 10:56.865
I agree.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.327
A real hero is a team player,
someone who acts selflessly.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.663
Not sure you heard the part
where I agreed.

11:03.288 --> 11:07.417
Personally, I always felt
that Admiral Ackbar was the unsung hero.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.921
A strategic military man
who led combat ops against the Empire.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.547
Is that how you see it, Phil?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.801
S.H.I.E.L.D. is the Empire,
and your ragtag group is the Rebels?

11:16.218 --> 11:20.472
I've devoted everything to S.H.I.E.L.D.,
I gave my life for it, literally.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.975
Oh, I don't deny that you've done a lot
of good in the past, but a true hero

11:24.184 --> 11:27.020
- doesn't protect a brutal killer.
- What are you talking about?

11:28.021 --> 11:31.400
Yesterday, your fiery friend killed
a prisoner named Santino Noguera.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.277
Was the man a murderer with three strikes?
Yes.

11:34.528 --> 11:38.407
But the legal system sentenced him
to prison, not to death.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.867
Listen, Phil...

11:41.284 --> 11:43.620
I understand your desire to protect
Daisy Johnson.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.499
She's a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
But this other guy is a problem.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.292
The world has its eyes on S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.670
and we can't afford to be in business
with a murderer.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.755
Now, where is he?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.679
<i>Don't worry.</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:04.057
You're safe. Even if we detach,
it has thrusters that...

12:04.433 --> 12:06.017
I understand the science.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.854
I'm not worried we're gonna fall.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.440
Worried about what you're not telling me.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.779
Why are we hiding in here?

12:19.114 --> 12:22.993
It's because of me. I used to be
an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. but I left,

12:23.243 --> 12:26.705
- and now the Director's hunting me down.
- Why do Robbie and I have to hide?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.916
Aren't you a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, too?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.128
- Yes, he is, but...
- Stop.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.091
I appreciate what you're trying
to do here, but...

12:38.842 --> 12:40.510
I can't lie to him anymore.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.814
You deserve the truth.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.735
All of it.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.135
Uncle Eli know you're borrowing his car?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.638
Why aren't you in bed, boy?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.682
Bed's for people who aren't taking honours
classes,

13:27.849 --> 13:31.102
who don't have soccer practice,
who don't want to go to college.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.646
So why aren't you in bed?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.359
- Business opportunity.
- You're racing again?

13:38.527 --> 13:41.112
What can I say? This cholo's like an ATM.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.698
I won a grand off him last week.
Now he wants a rematch.

13:43.949 --> 13:47.202
Is that guy with the Fifth Street?
There's a reason they call them the Locos.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.703
Nah, he ain't like that.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.998
He just likes to race. You want to come?

13:52.999 --> 13:56.169
No, I can't. I gotta finish a lab report
for science.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.963
All work, no play...

13:58.171 --> 14:00.674
- Gets me into Stanford or Berkeley.
- Yeah, I know.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.844
But will it make you happy?
I mean, look at <i>tío.</i>

14:04.511 --> 14:08.014
He's got all those degrees, bought this
sweet car, never has time to enjoy it.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.434
All he does is work.
You want to be like him?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.647
Come on. Live a little.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.899
I'll help you with your homework
when we get back.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.280
Okay. But you are not helping me
with my homework.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.074
I need to get an A.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.717
So, what is different now?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.177
Why does Lucy Bauer think
that she can succeed this time?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.930
<i>- She has the book.</i>
- Yeah, but she had it back then, too.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.182
Didn't stop her
from getting ghost-toasted.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.935
There must be something...

14:54.686 --> 14:56.062
something new.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.440
<i>Did you get my inventory
from Momentum Labs?</i>

14:58.690 --> 15:01.276
Yep. I'm looking at it just now. It seems
like they took everything crucial,

15:01.610 --> 15:04.946
apart from the main-- Hey. Hey!
What the hell?

15:05.280 --> 15:06.239
Director's orders.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.450
- Airwell's clear.
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, in that case,

15:08.575 --> 15:11.036
you should check under the microscope
and in the fridge 'cause those Inhumans

15:11.119 --> 15:13.079
can be tricky bastards. Yeah,
you can tell the Director

15:13.246 --> 15:15.749
- this is just one giant snark hunt.
- Area is clear.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.293
That's British for a bloody waste of time.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.088
<i>- Feel better?
- Nope. Not in the least.</i>

15:22.505 --> 15:24.799
I don't like the way they're hunting down
Daisy like an animal.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.760
I don't trust the new Director,

15:26.927 --> 15:30.013
and if Simmons doesn't call me back soon,
I swear, I'm gonna...

15:30.889 --> 15:33.558
<i>You worried about her safety,
or are you two going through something?</i>

15:34.684 --> 15:36.269
Not sure. Maybe both.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.148
Power.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.152
Yeah. It's power. Momentum
couldn't produce enough energy

15:44.319 --> 15:48.657
at their lab, so she needs a place with
more power. I'll start looking into it.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.662
Are you still beating yourself up
about that night?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.038
What night?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.375
- He blames himself that I'm in the chair.
- 'Cause it's my fault.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.294
- It was bad luck.
- There's no such thing as luck.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.339
There's decisions and consequences.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.301
And I made a whole lot of bad decisions
that night.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.223
Like bringing you along.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.936
Hey, so how fast are we gonna go
in this race?

16:18.812 --> 16:22.148
First of all, we aren't racing, all right?
I am. You're gonna watch.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.276
Secondly, it's not about fast.

16:26.027 --> 16:30.949
It's about torque. Quarter mile,
zero to 60, max acceleration.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.661
What?

16:34.953 --> 16:37.163
How come you didn't go back
and finish school?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.418
- You know why.
- That was then.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.712
We're doing okay now. I mean,
if you went back,

16:43.878 --> 16:48.591
- maybe you could be an engineer like <i>tío.</i>
- Gabe, I love what I do, man.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.468
I'm good at it.

16:51.302 --> 16:55.056
Besides, I'd rather be working on cars
than getting worn down in an office.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.226
You noticed that <i>tío's</i> been acting
different lately?

16:59.853 --> 17:03.273
Yeah. It's this project he's working on.

17:04.733 --> 17:08.028
Says his boss is out of control,
like he's gone power mad or something.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.280
See, that's another reason I like
what I do.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.282
Only power I got to worry about is
horsepower.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.329
Ah, come on.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.000
<i>¡Ándale, viejo!</i>
We got some money to make.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.795
Fifth Street!

17:26.588 --> 17:28.381
Just stay down! We'll get out of this!

18:17.639 --> 18:20.558
<i>I couldn't move.
Couldn't feel my legs.</i>

18:21.434 --> 18:22.936
<i>Was just lying there.</i>

18:24.521 --> 18:25.814
<i>I saw you.</i>

18:27.524 --> 18:28.775
Robbie?

18:31.027 --> 18:32.570
Robbie?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.908
No! No!

18:39.536 --> 18:41.121
I was sure you were dead.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.750
'Cause I was dead.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.348
Oh, hey, uh, Coulson?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.767
Uh. He's still escorting
the Director around.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.687
I need access to some redacted SSR files.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.564
Well, I can't help you.
Doesn't Simmons have clearance?

19:08.231 --> 19:10.358
Yeah, probably, except she's not answering
her phone and no one seems

19:10.525 --> 19:13.862
to know where she is. Uh, May's found
some equipment at Momentum Lab

19:14.028 --> 19:16.239
which was originally manufactured
by a company called Isodyne.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.158
- Never heard of it.
- Right. Well, that makes two of us.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.411
But May has, so might point us
in the direction of Lucy Bauer.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.496
Oh, uh, the...

19:24.122 --> 19:25.999
Director hasn't found you-know-who
and you-know-who?

19:26.166 --> 19:28.293
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right. Me neither.

19:29.961 --> 19:33.298
- Come on, man, you're crazy.
- Am I?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.760
What do you remember
about the Fifth Street attack?

19:39.220 --> 19:40.889
You mean after I thought you were dead?

19:42.390 --> 19:43.433
I guess...

19:44.642 --> 19:45.935
it was the good Samaritan.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.690
<i>I heard his motorcycle pull up.</i>

19:50.815 --> 19:53.401
Help! Please, sir!

19:54.527 --> 19:56.112
Please help me!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.114
<i>Next thing I know, he...</i>

19:58.907 --> 20:01.659
<i>- pulled me to safety.</i>
- Who was this guy?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.453
Don't know.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.957
Never saw him. Just some good Samaritan.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.377
He stopped, saved us, and moved on.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.426
<i>I remember he went over to you.</i>

20:21.679 --> 20:25.183
<i>Bent down to check on you.
And then you moved.</i>

20:25.767 --> 20:29.145
- That's when I knew you were alive.
- Yeah.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.316
That's not what happened.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.736
Well, the first part is like you said.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.615
The fire, the chase, the shooting.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.702
But what I remember most is feeling like
I screwed up.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.457
<i>Because of me,
you were going to die.</i>

20:50.667 --> 20:51.876
<i>We both were.</i>

20:56.839 --> 20:57.882
We didn't.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.218
We survived.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.515
Now, this is the part I never told you...

21:06.432 --> 21:07.892
the thing I tried to hide.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.980
When I was thrown from the car...

21:18.027 --> 21:19.445
<i>I begged God...</i>

21:20.154 --> 21:24.117
<i>I begged the universe, I begged anyone
who would listen, that you be spared.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.537
I swore that I'd give anything
to save you.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.879
Don't stop there.

21:41.884 --> 21:42.969
Then what?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.388
Then I hit the street...

21:46.389 --> 21:47.557
and I died.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.856
<i>And there's nothing.</i>

21:56.774 --> 21:58.192
<i>It's just darkness.</i>

22:00.361 --> 22:01.904
<i>Then I heard a voice.</i>

22:02.864 --> 22:05.158
<i>It was asking me if I wanted
a second chance.</i>

22:05.616 --> 22:07.869
<i>Did I want to punish those who hurt
my brother?</i>

22:08.786 --> 22:10.788
<i>Did I want to avenge my own death?</i>

22:13.041 --> 22:17.003
<i>I answered, "Yes.
More than anything, yes."</i>

22:18.671 --> 22:24.052
And I was alive again. And you're right.
There was someone there when I came to.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.888
But it wasn't a good Samaritan.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.517
It was the Devil.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.857
<i>And whatever was inside him,
he passed it into me.</i>

22:44.030 --> 22:45.114
Ghost Rider.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.659
That's the deal I made.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.663
I swore to go after those who spilled
innocent blood.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.084
And then I was reborn.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.920
You killed all those Locos.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.048
No.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.927
No. That wasn't me.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.346
The thing inside me.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.892
It craves vengeance.

23:15.937 --> 23:18.314
Those gangsters got what they deserved
for what they did to you.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.025
Did to me? I'm fine.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.862
You ever hear me complain?
So, I can't walk anymore.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.697
I didn't ask for that,
but I'm fine with it.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.576
Don't you put their blood on me.

23:40.294 --> 23:46.008
Oh, she's a real beauty, Phil.
'69 Charger, BDS blower, am I right?

23:46.259 --> 23:49.262
- Yes, you are.
- Yep. I collected Hot Wheels as a kid.

23:49.512 --> 23:52.098
Well, they don't make them any hotter
than this one. So...

23:53.141 --> 23:54.892
I hope you're satisfied
that the enhanced people

23:55.059 --> 23:56.602
you're searching for are nowhere
in the plane.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.898
I am. And I appreciate your respect
for the directorship, Phil,

24:01.065 --> 24:04.610
that you didn't lie to me.
'Cause, technically...

24:06.612 --> 24:09.490
...they're not inside the plane...

24:10.158 --> 24:11.200
are they?

24:14.871 --> 24:18.875
I've been on the Zephyr enough to notice
when the containment module is missing.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.462
Okay, this looks bad,

24:22.628 --> 24:24.839
but I've seen Coulson talk his way
out of tighter spots than this.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.925
Uh, sir, I know the timing isn't great
but I need you to authorise clearance

24:28.092 --> 24:30.595
- so I can access redacted SSR...
- I'll take that, Agent Fitz.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.930
- We have a more pressing issue.
- I... I know, I know, but it's just

24:33.014 --> 24:34.849
a few signatures. I believe
it could lead us to Lucy Bauer

24:35.016 --> 24:37.226
- and Eli Morrow.
- Finding those two is our top priority.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.604
If Fitz can determine where they are,
we have to act immediate...

24:40.438 --> 24:42.064
You know where my Uncle is?

24:47.570 --> 24:50.448
- You'll get a fair trial.
- What about my Uncle?

24:50.615 --> 24:53.075
We'll take every appropriate action once
we've landed.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.578
Turn your plane around. We're going back
to HQ where these people

24:55.745 --> 24:57.205
will be detained and charged.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.708
There's no way I'm going back
to their base. My uncle's in trouble.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.086
It's called a containment module
for a reason.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.130
Sir, I don't think
you're considering the threat level

25:06.214 --> 25:08.508
- that these two people represent.
- Securing a known fugitive and a killer

25:08.674 --> 25:10.259
is more important than rescuing
an escaped convict.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.971
Yeah, but it's not just Eli Morrow who's
in danger. I believe that what Lucy Bauer

25:14.138 --> 25:16.599
is trying to achieve could theoretically
affect thousands of people.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.393
Jeffrey, I'd argue that Daisy and Robbie
are already secure.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.187
- We should listen to...
- It's Director Mace,

25:21.354 --> 25:23.523
and I'd be more amenable
to your suggestions if you'd been honest

25:23.689 --> 25:26.734
with me from the start. But by wasting
my time, you've wasted my goodwill.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.278
Now turn the plane around and return
to HQ!

25:30.321 --> 25:32.949
- I'm not going back to their base!
- Robbie!

25:33.658 --> 25:35.785
Don't give them more reasons to be afraid
of you.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.412
It's not me they need to be afraid of!

25:38.621 --> 25:41.874
It's the other guy and he wants out!

25:44.877 --> 25:46.879
- Will it hold?
- No one's broken out yet,

25:47.046 --> 25:48.881
and it's held
some pretty potent individuals.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.092
Robbie, stop!

25:51.259 --> 25:52.301
What's gonna happen?

25:54.845 --> 25:56.389
Close your eyes.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.525
Is he an Inhuman?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.987
- Claims he made a deal with the devil.
- Which is nonsense.

26:11.696 --> 26:14.031
You know, the rationalist in me
wants to agree

26:14.115 --> 26:17.535
but skull on fire presents a pretty
compelling argument for "Hail Satan."

26:20.871 --> 26:23.416
Fitz? We still good?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.586
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
The module's poly-adaptive material

26:26.752 --> 26:29.547
is the most sophisticated compound
that S.H.I.E.L.D. has...

26:34.677 --> 26:36.679
That's not possible.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.399
Stay back. I've got this.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.413
No, I have to see this.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.131
Robbie, that's enough!

27:15.676 --> 27:19.013
Stop! We'll do what you want! Robbie!
No!

27:19.930 --> 27:22.224
We'll find your uncle! Stop!

27:25.019 --> 27:26.062
Robbie!

27:27.021 --> 27:30.066
Robbie, look at me! Stop! Robbie!

27:54.173 --> 27:55.758
Get me out of here.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.102
- You find anything?
- Yeah, but I tell you, though,

28:06.268 --> 28:10.481
whoever created this tapestry
of security nonsense is a total wanker.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.234
Honestly, even with Coulson's signature,
do you know how hard it was for me

28:13.401 --> 28:17.697
to find someone with a ROY-G-BIV clearance
just so I could unredact these files?

28:17.988 --> 28:20.825
Uh, do I have to pretend to be outraged
or can we get to it?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.452
Frustrated that nobody seems to know
where Simmons is.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.748
Anyway, it looks like Agent May was right
about Isodyne.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.751
Peggy Carter and her team encountered them
back in the '40s.

28:31.085 --> 28:34.547
They were conducting experiments
on something called "Zero Matter,"

28:34.714 --> 28:37.508
- or "Dark Force."
- Who names these?

28:37.717 --> 28:41.637
- Are there focus groups for evil things?
- Isodyne doesn't exist anymore.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.891
Its assets were acquired
by Roxxon Corporation in the '50s.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.812
And guess who holds all the land deeds
to Momentum Lab facilities.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.648
Are you gonna guess?

28:53.733 --> 28:57.403
Well, seems like kind of a no-brainer,
but is it Roxxon?

28:57.653 --> 28:58.571
It's like you're psychic.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.990
This Roxxon power plant closed down
years ago,

29:01.157 --> 29:05.035
because of safety violations.
But if Lucy Bauer can get it operational,

29:05.411 --> 29:07.455
it's got more than enough power
for her experiment.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.666
Let's reroute the Zephyr and send
the coordinates to May's Quinjet.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.042
We can rendezvous there.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.254
Shouldn't we wait until Coulson
convinces the Director

29:15.421 --> 29:18.382
- to go along with the plan?
- No. Mace is a reasonable guy.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.803
We do not negotiate with terrorists.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.681
I don't think it's fair to paint Mr Reyes
as a terrorist.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.976
He's a murderer who attacked us
and threatened to take down

29:29.226 --> 29:31.562
this entire plane if we didn't cede
to his demands.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.899
- How is that not a terrorist?
- It sounds a little Fox News to me but...

29:35.649 --> 29:36.734
you're not wrong.

29:37.485 --> 29:40.654
It doesn't change the fact that we have
no way to contain Mr Reyes.

29:40.863 --> 29:45.159
He's also the only person we know
who can take out Lucy Bauer. We need him.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.625
- He'll have to pay for what he did.
- I agree.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.919
But today's not that day.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.635
Okay, I've done everything you've asked.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.637
There's no way to turn this off.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.556
This plant was shut down for a reason.
It could blow at any time.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.727
Well, then, you better work faster.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.026
I wish Joe were here to see this come
to life.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.362
This was his crazy dream.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.161
Joe was a genius.

30:29.954 --> 30:33.457
- And you ruined his life.
- Joe got what he deserved.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.794
My nephew's in a wheelchair
because of those thugs he hired.

30:36.961 --> 30:41.257
Oh, don't act like you're innocent in all
of this.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.760
It's that damn book.
I tried to warn you about it.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.887
You wouldn't listen.

31:00.651 --> 31:01.944
Joe...

31:02.236 --> 31:04.071
- I told you to stay out.
- You need help.

31:04.321 --> 31:07.283
Hey, look, we're worried about you, okay?
Just... just give me the book.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.703
Get out!

31:12.746 --> 31:15.207
Get out!

31:15.749 --> 31:18.669
He's insane. Changing the specs
without consulting us?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.337
We got to get that book away from him.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.756
- You have to trust us.
- Trust?

31:23.007 --> 31:26.051
Trust. Did you just see what happened?
This is about safety.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.137
The energy stored in those power cells

31:28.304 --> 31:30.431
could kill all of us
if anything goes wrong.

31:31.807 --> 31:36.061
You know, I... I don't even know
what this project's goal is anymore.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.109
The goal has changed slightly.

31:44.820 --> 31:50.784
We are still creating matter from nothing,
but the book revealed something exciting.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.996
We no longer need a machine
to generate it.

31:55.372 --> 31:59.084
- Joe's trying to generate matter himself?
- Think of all the good that we can do.

31:59.251 --> 32:04.924
We're not just creating elements,
but compounds, material, life.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.969
He wants to be a god.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.806
Where do you think the book came from?

32:14.850 --> 32:18.938
You're just as insane as he is.
God didn't write that book.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.398
- The devil did.
- You are just jealous.

32:22.066 --> 32:24.777
- Because you want the book for yourself.
- You're damn right.

32:25.319 --> 32:28.948
I want it so I can destroy it,
before it destroys all of us.

32:37.915 --> 32:40.376
They're definitely here. The plant
started producing energy

32:40.542 --> 32:42.294
- about an hour ago.
- The stats are high

32:42.503 --> 32:45.130
and very unstable. Turbines can blow
and destroy the whole building,

32:45.255 --> 32:47.132
or the dam could break
and wipe out everything in its path.

32:47.257 --> 32:50.386
- So, no pressure.
- What are we waiting for?

32:50.719 --> 32:52.972
Remind me why he's here after what he did
to Mace.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.933
Mr Reyes wants the safe return
of his uncle as much as we want

32:56.100 --> 32:58.102
- the power plant shut down.
- And I'm gonna stop that lady

32:58.268 --> 33:00.562
- the way I stopped the other ghosts.
- And who's gonna stop you?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.022
Hey, guys?

33:03.107 --> 33:05.025
I've got some big, fat,
disappointing news.

33:05.359 --> 33:08.070
I can't hack in and shut down the plant's
operating system from here.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.948
Well, you're out of practice.
Too much punching, not enough hacking.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.994
Very funny. No, I can't hack in
because their system isn't on a network.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.578
It predates the Internet.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.915
<i>Coulson, how did anything
ever get done back in the old-timey days?</i>

33:20.207 --> 33:22.042
I ask myself that all the time.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.754
Okay, you heard Daisy. We're gonna have
to do this from the inside.

33:25.963 --> 33:29.383
Fitz and Mack, you're the engineers.
Focus on shutting the power plant down.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.385
We'll rescue Eli Morrow.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.138
- Got it.
- Okay, then.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.606
West and down another level
to the control room,

33:44.773 --> 33:47.192
and it's not that you care,
but the power surges are growing

33:47.359 --> 33:48.819
<i>more frequent and more intense.</i>

33:49.028 --> 33:51.030
You're just full of good news today,
aren't you?

33:51.697 --> 33:54.408
<i>If it makes you feel any better,
I'd rather be there with you than up here</i>

33:54.575 --> 33:56.160
<i>on injured reserve.</i>

34:01.373 --> 34:05.085
- May, are your comms working?
- Negative. Just static.

34:06.253 --> 34:10.174
Daisy, do you copy? Are you there?

34:12.259 --> 34:14.178
No. But I am.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.848
Find my uncle. I've got this.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.646
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

34:25.355 --> 34:28.817
- My Uncle is Eli Morrow.
- Of course.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.070
I've seen your picture.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.530
You're his nephew Gabriel...

34:34.364 --> 34:36.824
- like the angel.
- No.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.496
I'm the other one.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.712
It wasn't supposed to be you boys.
Joe hired that gang to take out Eli.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.632
- You think that makes me feel better?
- I don't care how it makes you feel.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.928
I just wanted you to understand
why I'm going to kill him.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.396
They've recreated
the entire experiment.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.195
I need you to get this outta here.

35:13.904 --> 35:16.698
Okay, but shouldn't we dismantle
all of this first?

35:16.949 --> 35:19.159
If this book is half as powerful
as everyone thinks it is,

35:19.368 --> 35:22.412
then getting it out of here and hiding it
somewhere safe is our top priority.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.873
You're the only one I trust.

35:31.547 --> 35:34.508
- Oh, this is bad, very bad.
- Why won't this power down?

35:34.925 --> 35:37.052
It's not like we're idiots.
I've built boards like this before.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.762
I understand what's supposed to happen.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.557
Yeah, well, maybe they did something to it
with that book that they have.

35:41.974 --> 35:45.394
- What? Like put a spell on it?
- No, no, of course not.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.396
But the book could've showed them
a different way to power it.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.232
I mean, think about it. Their power cells
are full of quantum tech

35:50.399 --> 35:51.900
that we might never understand.

35:52.484 --> 35:56.363
What... What about one of those, uh,
those perpetual EMPs from Miami?

35:56.738 --> 35:59.324
Maybe it would disrupt all of this
without blowing us to kingdom come.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.994
- Yeah, let's do it.
- All right, there's one on the Zephyr.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.996
I'll have Daisy send it down
in the containment module.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.915
Daisy? You copy?

36:07.708 --> 36:08.667
Coulson?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.962
All right, hold down the fort.
I'll be right back.

36:15.674 --> 36:19.094
Fitz, I found the chamber.
Does anyone copy?

36:20.637 --> 36:21.805
You.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.475
Mr Morrow, we have to get you
out of here.

36:27.644 --> 36:28.812
Where's the book?

36:29.855 --> 36:32.858
- Did she take the book?
- S.H.I.E.L.D. has it. It's safe.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.569
- You're safe.
- Stay away from this equipment.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.614
- It's very dangerous.
- You understand how this works?

36:38.989 --> 36:43.076
- Can you help me dismantle it?
- Yes, of course. But why would I...

36:43.619 --> 36:45.954
when it's taken me this long to achieve?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.923
Stand down! Stand down!
We got a situation!

36:56.256 --> 36:58.008
I need your help bringing an EMP
back inside!

36:58.175 --> 37:01.136
- Let's go. Move out.
- I had a husband I loved...

37:01.845 --> 37:06.475
work that challenged and thrilled me,
and just as everything that I dreamed of

37:06.642 --> 37:09.561
was within my grasp, this happened.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.774
But I'm gonna make it all right.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.568
Don't take this personally.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.325
How?

37:24.243 --> 37:26.203
Maybe I wasn't clear about who I am.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.208
How many innocent people have died
because of what you've done?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.418
I'm here to make you pay for your actions.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.630
- There are consequences for playing God.
- Me?

37:37.923 --> 37:41.260
Your uncle is the one who wants
to play God.

37:41.677 --> 37:44.179
He is the one who started
this whole nightmare.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.432
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wh... What...
What are you doing?

37:47.641 --> 37:50.352
- This is not finished yet.
- Look, I'm part of this team.

37:51.228 --> 37:54.106
And I refuse to be kept in the dark.
I want to see the book.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.943
Well, I don't have it. Joseph does,
and he's not here.

37:59.236 --> 38:03.407
And you will never get it.
Where is Frederick? Where are the others?

38:07.661 --> 38:10.455
What have you done with them?

38:10.998 --> 38:12.833
Same thing that I'm gonna do to you.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.295
No, no, no! Eli, no, please!
It's not finished yet!

38:16.461 --> 38:18.672
Please don't kill me!

38:21.008 --> 38:23.385
You weren't against Joseph
getting the power.

38:23.677 --> 38:27.180
- You just wanted it for yourself.
- Goodbye, Lucy.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.350
No. No, no, no!

38:46.199 --> 38:47.326
No.

38:49.703 --> 38:53.415
You're just like your uncle.
You have the same fire.

38:53.749 --> 38:54.708
No.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.002
Mine's worse.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.599
- What the hell you doing here?
- An errand for Coulson. You?

39:10.849 --> 39:12.851
Waiting for the Zephyr to send down
an EMP.

39:14.978 --> 39:18.065
- It was you the whole time.
- It took a lot longer than I had hoped.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.817
But all those years in jail,
I had to plan very carefully.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.320
The attack on Joseph Bauer
that wasn't payback.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.697
- You just wanted the Darkhold.
- Yeah.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.825
He was a lot tougher than he looked.
I beat the hell out of him.

39:28.992 --> 39:32.162
He never gave up where he hid that book.
Listen, if I were you...

39:33.372 --> 39:34.748
I'd get the hell out of here.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.299
No.

39:51.515 --> 39:52.766
Oh, no.
