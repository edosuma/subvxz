["Daydreaming" playing]

00:21.555 --> 00:28.096
* I remember when the sea
Was singing *

00:29.530 --> 00:36.204
* And all of my thoughts
Were ringing *

00:36.237 --> 00:43.144
* Crossed the ocean
Round the world, speeding *

00:44.412 --> 00:50.551
* And nobody
Could catch me daydreaming *

00:52.186 --> 00:55.856
* But I'm daydreaming now *

00:55.889 --> 00:58.058
* Daydreaming

00:59.693 --> 01:06.100
* About the time
We knew the lightning *

01:13.141 --> 01:19.313
* Electricity screaming

01:20.381 --> 01:26.287
* Between me and the siren

01:27.488 --> 01:32.326
* On the ocean up the waves

01:32.360 --> 01:38.899
* Climbed them to the sky
To the stars *

01:38.932 --> 01:43.337
* To the limits

01:43.371 --> 01:47.308
* And I'm daydreaming now *

01:47.341 --> 01:50.678
* Daydreaming

[siren wailing]

[tires screeching]

02:38.492 --> 02:39.560
Look out!

02:49.470 --> 02:50.938
-Hold on!
-[grunts]

02:50.971 --> 02:52.640
[tires screeching]

02:53.441 --> 02:54.575
[both groan]

02:56.377 --> 02:57.411
They're dragging us!

02:59.547 --> 03:01.382
[sighs] No!

03:08.489 --> 03:09.490
[both panting]

04:02.510 --> 04:03.977
Supergirl, you're the best.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.952
Doesn't even stop
for autographs anymore.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.370
Cool car chase.
Very fast, very furious.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.071
Any luck IDing
the one that got away.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.940
Oh, still running
facial recognition.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.375
So far nothing.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.943
Anything else we can go on?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.479
This is his.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.948
Winn, can you send a sample
up to Alex's lab?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.983
Maybe his DNA
is already in the database.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.853
Okay. Well,
this is new and gross.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.655
[sighs]
I should have cuffed him.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.658
You knocked him 100 yards
into the roof of that SUV.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.026
Not to mention saving
my fiancee and I.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.396
Yeah. And that truck
was full of aluminum tubing.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.665
Right, which doesn't
really seem like much until

04:57.698 --> 05:00.334
you use it to build
an illegal nuclear centrifuge.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.703
This is a big win, Supergirl.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.905
It's not a win until
they're behind bars.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.041
Let's get this guy.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.980
Hey, uh...

05:13.013 --> 05:13.981
So, tomorrow Maggie and I

05:14.014 --> 05:15.349
are gonna go do
the tasting for the wedding.

05:15.383 --> 05:19.487
Three hours of hors d'oeuvres
and nothing but hors d'oeuvres.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.357
Potstickers, oyster shooters,
pigs in blankets.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.359
Did I mention
the potstickers? [chuckles]

05:26.560 --> 05:27.628
Do you wanna...

05:27.661 --> 05:29.397
Uh, if I'm not busy, sure.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.098
Well, we're all gonna meet
at the bar beforehand, too.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.535
-So, if you want to--
-I'll try.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.637
I mean, I thought it was bad
when she skipped pizza night.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.706
But skipping free apps.
I mean, come on.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.442
These are like the beginning
of the dark days.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.076
Hey, come on.
Grief doesn't have a deadline.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.044
Look, I know. But, I mean,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.680
she goes from being
little miss sunshine to,

05:46.714 --> 05:48.048
well, Alex, basically.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.451
What? I'm not like that.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.685
Oh, come on, Alex.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.087
Your unrelenting seriousness
is one of your best qualities.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
I'm not like that.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.893
I'm not.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.868
People like to argue
that capitalists are only
concerned with themselves.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.603
The truth is

06:09.637 --> 06:10.771
without big business,

06:10.804 --> 06:14.074
this city would still be
in ruin from those Daxamites.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.077
Look at us now.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.180
Bustling.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.651
I think, we all should give
ourselves a pat on the back

06:23.684 --> 06:26.153
And, let's not forget to
glad-hand the Mayor as well.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.490
Without him, none of this
could have happened either.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.492
It's you, Morgan.
It's all of you.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.961
In six months,
you've done the impossible.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.063
-Let's not forget Supergirl.
-[Lena] Let's not
forget Supergirl.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.036
Literally none of
the heavy lifting could've
been done without her.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.172
Yes. Of course.
Which is why I'm excited

06:45.205 --> 06:48.509
about the unveiling of
"The Girl of Steel" statue

06:48.542 --> 06:49.710
at the waterfront.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.012
Mayor, it's gonna take
a lot more than a pretty statue

06:52.045 --> 06:56.484
to bring people down to
that slum of a waterfront.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.686
I am still working on
the zoning commission, Morgan.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.988
You'd do better to explain
how my development

07:01.021 --> 07:03.991
will revitalize
that neighborhood.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.661
Starting with moving out
homelessness, crime...

07:07.695 --> 07:11.632
Moving in opportunity
and an expanded tax base.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.967
They've all heard your
sales pitch, Morgan.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.504
We all have.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.071
Yes. I'm sure
that everybody here

07:18.105 --> 07:20.941
has had a chance to read
CatCo's inflammatory articles

07:20.974 --> 07:23.611
about that sales pitch,

07:23.644 --> 07:26.246
Articles that have become
increasingly biased ever since

07:26.279 --> 07:29.082
you took over baby-sitting
Cat Grant's mouthpiece.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.184
Your development would
level the whole area.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.152
Force people from their homes,

07:32.185 --> 07:34.087
just to build
high-rises for the wealthy.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.989
Lena...

07:37.725 --> 07:40.160
Are you spouting the CatCo
company line?

07:40.728 --> 07:43.096
Really? Ah...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.431
I guess
I shouldn't be surprised,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.735
considering all the good press
they've been giving you lately.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.670
She's earned that good press

07:49.703 --> 07:52.105
by donating millions of dollars
to the rebuilding efforts.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.106
Hmm...

07:54.074 --> 07:55.175
That's funny because I...

07:55.208 --> 07:58.011
I thought it was restitution
for what her brother did.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.248
Or was it her mother?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.051
Or was it Lena?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.118
Seeing as how she is the one

08:05.152 --> 08:07.487
who brought the aliens here
in the first place.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.091
A little bit
of business advice, Lena...

08:13.627 --> 08:16.630
Guilt is not
a good business strategy.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.899
-No?
-No.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.102
Neither is exploitation.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.739
I just want
a fair hearing, that's all.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.576
I hate to think that
any of you here were unfair.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.244
Hmm? Now...

08:31.278 --> 08:33.581
My people have put together
a tremendous spread,

08:33.614 --> 08:34.748
just in the office next door.

08:34.782 --> 08:35.983
Why don't we all
adjourn over there

08:36.016 --> 08:37.017
and take a sample of that?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.086
Mr. Olsen, you're welcome
to join us as well.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.089
You know, we can disagree, but
still break bread together.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.892
You know, Edge, you are not as
powerful as you think you are.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.194
Oh, no?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.530
Then what are we doing
in my office?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.070
[chuckles]

08:57.104 --> 08:58.739
-[indistinct chatter]
-[reporter] Ms. Grant!

08:58.772 --> 09:02.142
-[Cat] Okay, Carl.
-Does President Marsdin
believe climate change is real?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.678
Uh, yes. Yes, Carl.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.213
As a matter of fact, she does.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.716
She also believes that
two plus two equals four

09:08.749 --> 09:11.719
and the Earth is round because
the President is not a moron.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.587
Any third grader knows
that global warming

09:13.621 --> 09:14.822
is the biggest threat
of our time.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.057
And I'm happy to report
that the intellectual capacity

09:17.090 --> 09:20.628
of our President
is not inferior to that
of an eight year old.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.229
Next question.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.931
I knew Ms. Grant
was meant for great things,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.265
but National City
is gonna miss her.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.068
[sighs] Best Press Secretary
since Robert Gibbs.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.970
Yeah. She makes Gibbs
look like a hall monitor.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.339
With Ms. Grant in D.C.
and Snapper on sabbatical,

09:32.372 --> 09:35.008
it's going to be oddly
congenial around here.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.576
Well, we will do our best.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.646
Okay, guys. Look alive.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.080
All right,
we're about a week away

09:40.113 --> 09:40.948
from locking up this issue,

09:40.981 --> 09:42.683
so I need to know
what's going on.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.985
What's up with sports?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.453
As of last night,

09:46.486 --> 09:51.224
the Metropolis Monarchs
officially have the worst
record in baseball.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.226
-Crime.
-There's not much to cover.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.362
Crime's been down 65%
over the past six months.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.698
Supergirl has turned
the entire city around

09:57.731 --> 09:59.332
pretty much single-handedly.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.433
Which brings me
to my next point...

10:00.467 --> 10:03.070
How are you doing on
that exclusive with Supergirl?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.739
Oh, uh, Supergirl's
been too busy

10:05.773 --> 10:08.375
to have a one-on-one
conversation about
the invasion.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.277
The statue dedication
is this weekend.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.745
I'll do my best.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.050
Well, you have
your assignments, right?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.285
Uh... Lets get to work.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.352
Thanks.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.023
Kara...

10:25.158 --> 10:27.294
Hey, [stammering]
are you sure that
you're okay to write this

10:27.327 --> 10:29.129
or is this going to
bring up some old stuff?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.363
I said I was.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.300
Okay. Well, I'm here if you
wanna talk or grab a drink--

10:33.333 --> 10:35.235
Do you want me to write
the article or grab a drink?

10:37.204 --> 10:41.308
Okay. Listen,
I'm on your side. Okay?

10:41.341 --> 10:44.778
Look, I know more than anybody,
how much ass Supergirl has been
kicking lately.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.246
Well, that's my job.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.783
[Edge] There's still
more I can do.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.719
And touch people's lives.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.421
-[James] What is this
blowhard up to now?
-[ Edge] In that vein,

10:54.454 --> 10:58.358
I'd like to announce a bold
new direction for my company.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.162
I'm buying CatCo.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.004
[Edge] In the last few years,
the press in this town

11:11.038 --> 11:13.240
-has swung wildly to one side.
-[knocking]

11:13.741 --> 11:15.943
Hey.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.779
I hate that sentient bottle
of cheap cologne.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.280
-Did you know?
-No.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.049
James was blindsided too.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.317
He thinks it's his fault
for getting in Edge's face.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.353
Only he would spend
that kind of money on a grudge.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.356
Do you think the shareholders
will listen to Cat?

11:29.389 --> 11:32.192
Uh, well, Cat had to put
her shares in a blind trust

11:32.225 --> 11:34.094
when she became
Press Secretary.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.129
But I did some digging...

11:36.163 --> 11:39.099
Edge has been quietly
buying up shares until today,

11:39.132 --> 11:43.070
when he put a tender offer
to the majority shareholders.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.205
Hey! No more free press.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.974
You've invested
in his portfolio though.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.242
So, I figured if
you could talk to him,

11:49.276 --> 11:50.944
you might be able
to be persuasive.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.080
Edge doesn't respect any
opinions that aren't his own.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.015
-Specially not a woman's.
-Lena...

11:55.048 --> 11:56.516
You helped Supergirl
save the world.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.786
How hard could
one stubborn sexist be?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.755
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.056
Thanks.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.759
[stutters]
Hey, uh...

12:06.827 --> 12:08.395
I mean, I miss you.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.662
Is everything okay?

12:09.696 --> 12:11.364
'Cause I keep trying to make
plans and you keep ditching.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.465
I've just been busy.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.767
Right, um...

12:15.803 --> 12:17.104
I also just...

12:18.806 --> 12:20.140
I wanted to say I was sorry

12:20.173 --> 12:22.042
for the part I played
in what happened to Mon-El.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.378
And that, I'm here for you
if you still want that.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.115
No, you did
what you had to do.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.084
And, that was Supergirl's
call anyway, not yours.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.086
[reporter]
...breaking news this morning.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.789
There are reports
of a burglary in Old Town.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.990
We'll bring you the latest--

12:37.024 --> 12:38.525
I should get going.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.460
Yeah, uh... Brunch, soon?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.135
[reporter]
Reporting from downtown
National City,

12:48.168 --> 12:49.569
it seems Supergirl has been

12:49.602 --> 12:51.972
just about everywhere
these days.

12:52.005 --> 12:56.109
She does know that the cops
are occasionally capable of
doing their jobs, right?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.378
And we can forget about
her showing up tonight.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.013
Or finishing her assignment.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.548
Hey, how much longer do we
have to keep giving her space?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.383
I don't know how much
more space I can give.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.552
-As frustrating as this is--
-Beyond.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.120
We're not the ones
who lost someone.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.422
I think patience is
the least we can offer.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.457
Agreed?

13:23.536 --> 13:26.339
[sighs]
Call me selfish, but

13:26.373 --> 13:29.142
I just... I really
miss my sister sometimes.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.079
I know.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.513
Cheer up. It's time
for that tasting.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.087
You don't wanna go
to that tasting, do you?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.290
What's going on with you?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.125
Why are you suddenly
so down on this wedding?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.360
No, [stammering]
I'm not down on it.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.495
I just, I...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.499
I don't know.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.338
Well, when you figure it out,
let me know.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.208
[Winn] Hey.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.442
I think we may have
tracked down the Merc.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.510
I just got an alert
from the DEO.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.145
Supergirl's gonna
meet us there.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.451
You were able to trace
the Merc with his blood?

14:11.484 --> 14:14.387
Meet Robert DuBois.
Goes by Bloodsport,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.489
which is not any sport
I've ever heard of.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.092
What do we know about him?

14:19.126 --> 14:21.228
Oh, you remember those bombings
at City Hall, a few years ago?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.430
That was him. And,
he's been AWOL ever since.

14:25.165 --> 14:25.933
[beeping]

14:25.966 --> 14:28.301
His file says
he's ex-military.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.570
Where was he last stationed?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.973
Fort Harrison. Like 20 minutes
outside the city.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.207
He worked security detail.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.109
He'd have knowledge of all
the ins and outs of the base.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.145
He could sneak on,
locate weapons, technology,

14:38.178 --> 14:39.179
anything he wanted to.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.114
Winn, call his CO.
See what they know about him.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.082
Okay.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.085
Whoa, whoa!

14:45.118 --> 14:47.420
-What?
-Okay, the base server is down.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.289
This system is scrambled.
Somebody hacked it.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.457
I've got this.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.613
Lead...

15:35.068 --> 15:36.203
[grunts]

15:41.308 --> 15:42.509
[soldier] Who's there?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.219
[groans]

16:04.197 --> 16:07.034
[soldier groaning] Help me!
Please...

16:08.101 --> 16:09.236
Help me!

16:10.470 --> 16:12.072
[groaning]

16:12.105 --> 16:14.207
It's okay. I'm here.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.243
I'm here. I've got you.
I've got you.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.081
You have no internal injuries.
You're gonna be okay.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.483
[beeping]

16:33.393 --> 16:35.495
What's wrong?
Why'd you use the signal watch?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.430
You didn't get that article in.

16:37.464 --> 16:42.202
[stammers] You beepered me
for a deadline?

16:44.204 --> 16:45.638
That watch is
for emergencies only.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.274
I know what the watch is for,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.142
but this feels
like an emergency.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.511
I'm worried about you, Kara.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.046
And, at a certain
point of time,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.815
-I have to be your boss.
-No, don't ever,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.118
ever do that again.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.419
What? Ask you to do your job?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.188
I am doing my job.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.222
No, Supergirl is doing her job.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.058
Kara Danvers has been
completely off the radar.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.227
Oh, I'm sorry, James.
I've been a little busy.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.196
You know, the world's
not gonna save itself.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.630
But you still have a life.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.101
Okay? You still have
a job as a reporter.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.668
And that life makes you, you.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.570
No, what makes me, me

17:18.338 --> 17:20.107
is Supergirl.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.474
That's who I am
at my core.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.111
And you're one
to talk, Guardian.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.115
Okay. Guardian means
a lot to me.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.583
But so does James Olsen.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.185
And he runs CatCo.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.320
And that job's important.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.291
[sighs]

17:38.325 --> 17:39.259
You know something...

17:39.292 --> 17:43.163
If I'm expected to put
Supergirl on hold

17:43.196 --> 17:45.332
just to write
this article for you,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.500
then maybe being a reporter
isn't a good idea.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.468
[stammering]
What are you saying?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.303
I'm saying I have
important things to do.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.139
But not here at CatCo.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.142
Not as a reporter.
Not as Kara Danvers.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.309
Kara, don't do this.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.677
I quit.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.212
Kara...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.851
And just when exactly were
you going to notify us

18:04.884 --> 18:07.587
that you had a Daxamite
war ship in your possession.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.123
Alien artifacts
are the DEO's purview.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.861
You can rest assured
I will talk to
the President, General Lane.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.364
And if anything happens
as a result of your overreach,

18:17.397 --> 18:19.866
you mark my words,
she'll have your stars.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.535
Respect!

18:22.569 --> 18:24.604
Whilst I appreciate the nod
of confidence, Agent Schott,

18:24.637 --> 18:27.874
do you have any words
that might actually help me?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.876
Words, no.
Pictures, definitely.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.313
Um... I had the military
supplier that DuBois robbed

18:33.346 --> 18:35.848
inventory what was taken.
It turns out

18:35.882 --> 18:38.651
it was not just aluminum rods.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.354
That's a high
pressure regulator.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.455
Aluminum rods
were just a cover.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.923
That was his real target.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.325
What would DuBois need it for?

18:45.358 --> 18:48.395
Well, he also stole
the cloaking device
from the Daxamite ship.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.863
And how exactly do those
two things go together?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.599
With the regulator,
he could stabilize

18:52.632 --> 18:55.368
the internal pressure
of an F-18 or a B-52

18:55.402 --> 18:58.405
to withstand the force
emitted by a cloaking shield.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.642
Able to retrofit it into
a fully cloaked aircraft.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.611
Our equipment would not
be able to detect that.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.247
Not even Supergirl's
X-ray vision could pick it up.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.416
He could drop
a nuke from the sky,
and nobody in National City

19:09.449 --> 19:10.917
would even know
he was overhead.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.852
Until it's too late.

19:12.885 --> 19:13.953
Agent Schott,
I want every flight

19:13.986 --> 19:16.323
in and out of National City
scanned for munitions.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.624
-Air and space.
-Yes, sir.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.292
Alex, put your team
on tactical alert

19:19.326 --> 19:20.527
and notify Supergirl

19:20.560 --> 19:22.862
-Okay.
-[cell phone vibrating]

19:24.597 --> 19:26.233
James, what is it?

19:31.938 --> 19:35.675
Lena, twice in my office
in as many days.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.445
[sing-song voice]
People are gonna start talking.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.879
Morgan, you have
all the charisma of

19:39.912 --> 19:42.249
a Michael Douglas movie
from the '90s.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.983
You didn't come all this way
just to flatter me, did you?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.518
I came because
I have a proposition.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.421
Ooh, good.
I do like propositions.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.690
Now, you know
I don't agree with
your waterfront development.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.960
But you are still the best
developer in National City.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.930
Let me get you a drink before
that compliment leaves
a bad taste in your mouth.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.599
Your work is why I have
invested in your portfolio

19:59.632 --> 20:01.401
and why I intend
to invest more.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.002
Let me guess...

20:03.035 --> 20:04.404
You want me
to stay away from CatCo?

20:04.437 --> 20:05.505
Oh, come on, Morgan.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.574
CatCo isn't good business
for you and you know it.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.509
There's a city out there
that needs to be rebuilt.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.444
That's what you're good at,
focus on that.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.280
You know, you can take
the Luthor logo off your name,

20:13.313 --> 20:14.914
but people still
aren't gonna trust you.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.585
And that's a really easy
sentiment to reinforce

20:18.618 --> 20:22.455
once I have CatCo's
editorial under my control.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.291
People love to believe
what they read.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.495
Using CatCo to defame
your enemies and promote
your own agenda.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.900
-That's despicable.
-Oh, no.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.503
That's good business.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.638
I'll see myself out.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.379
You ready?

20:46.713 --> 20:47.847
We are.

20:49.516 --> 20:53.286
They'll literally never
see it coming.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.888
That's the idea.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.459
[Cat] The President did not
place any listening devices

20:59.492 --> 21:03.029
in the speakers, the microwave,
or his toaster, or his shoes.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.998
Or anywhere else
on his premises or person.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.000
Now, sadly, I think
we are so inured

21:08.034 --> 21:10.036
to the pathological lying
of the speaker that,

21:10.069 --> 21:12.872
we just don't think anything
he says is crazy anymore.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.607
Oh, good.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.376
What's the update
on Bloodsport?

21:16.409 --> 21:18.311
Do we know what he stole
from the military base?

21:18.345 --> 21:19.412
You quit?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.350
James has been
making the rounds.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.551
He's worried about you.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.353
I'm extremely
worried about you.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.286
Since when do you quit?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.989
CatCo isn't the point
for me anymore.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.893
You spent years working
your way up to be a reporter.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.528
And it was a waste of time.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.465
[scoffs] I would love to
see you tell Cat Grant that.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.899
Cat moved on. Why can't I?

21:39.932 --> 21:42.435
Okay. This is done.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.638
I am done
walking on egg shells.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.873
We all are.

21:46.906 --> 21:47.974
I've kept my distance.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.944
I have given you time
to grieve, without prodding,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.680
without making you
talk about Mon-El--

21:53.713 --> 21:54.981
There's nothing to talk about.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.016
Without forcing you
to go to game nights

21:57.049 --> 21:59.419
-or come to the bar.
-There was a burglary.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.320
There's always a burglary!

22:02.989 --> 22:04.957
But I've let it slide.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.395
Your pity party
has gone uninterrupted.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.563
My... My pity party?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.399
Who are you right now?

22:13.099 --> 22:14.667
Kara Danvers doesn't quit.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.569
She quits the things
that aren't important.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.439
CatCo is important!
You help people there

22:19.472 --> 22:20.707
Not like Supergirl does.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.910
-Kara Danvers--
-Kara Danvers sucks right now!

22:25.478 --> 22:27.980
Supergirl is great.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.650
Supergirl saved the world.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.919
So, if I could
choose to be her,

22:32.952 --> 22:33.886
why would I ever choose

22:33.920 --> 22:36.423
to be the sad girl
who's boyfriend is gone?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.124
I don't like that girl, Alex.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.860
-I know it hurts--
-No. You don't know anything.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.862
You've never had to make
a decision like this.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.532
Okay, then tell me
what it feels like.

22:45.565 --> 22:49.602
Please, just let...
Let me help. Let me
help you get over him.

22:49.636 --> 22:50.637
Get over him?

22:51.438 --> 22:52.605
That's... [sighs]

22:52.639 --> 22:54.474
He didn't dump me.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.009
I sent him away.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.878
And for all I know he's...

23:00.146 --> 23:01.948
-What?
-It doesn't matter.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.152
You're not letting yourself
feel anything.

23:06.185 --> 23:10.122
You're just bottling it up
inside, and you are
making bad decisions.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.057
And I'm worried--

23:11.090 --> 23:13.025
If it were Maggie,
what would you be doing?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.195
If the woman
you are about to marry

23:16.228 --> 23:18.931
was gone forever,
what would you be doing?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.536
-[stutters] I--
-You'd be at
the bar every night.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.905
You'd be a wreck at work.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
You'd be broken.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.676
I would.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.645
I would be.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.048
And it's okay if you are.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.550
I'm not.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.052
That's what humans do.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.590
And I'm better than that.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.158
Clark said it himself.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.128
The decision I made,

23:50.597 --> 23:53.232
he couldn't have
made that sacrifice

23:53.265 --> 23:57.203
But me, I couldn't have
lived with myself if I hadn't.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.206
I will always make
the decision I made.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.675
I am not a human.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.946
I tried to be.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.948
But I'm not.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.684
Kara Danvers was a mistake.

24:14.086 --> 24:18.224
So, if you have an update about
work, I'd love to hear it.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.992
Otherwise, um...

24:22.261 --> 24:25.632
Bloodsport has the capability
to cloak a nuke.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.568
We're thinking that he's gonna
hit the statue unveiling
at the waterfront.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.969
J'onn wants everyone there.

24:30.002 --> 24:30.937
I'll be there.

24:31.938 --> 24:32.972
Yeah.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.676
Kara Danvers

24:38.545 --> 24:39.979
is my favorite person.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.551
She saved me more times
than Supergirl ever could.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.985
So, just

24:46.018 --> 24:47.987
think about that while you're
trying to get rid of her.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.191
[door slams]

24:56.629 --> 24:58.497
[indistinct chatter]

25:11.343 --> 25:13.012
No sign of Bloodsport.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.281
It's quiet up here.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.152
You know,
I rarely flew on Mars.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.154
It was for battle,
not pleasure.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.291
When I first came to Earth,
I spent hours up in the sky.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.027
It's the only place
I could feel empty.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.130
Well, that's not what
I'm doing up here.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.901
Forgive me for saying,
but you seem to be courting
emptiness of late.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.402
And that's not you.

25:36.435 --> 25:40.640
I tried to be Kara Danvers
for 15 years. But
I'm not supposed to be her.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.743
I'm not supposed to be human.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.245
But you have a human heart now.

25:46.278 --> 25:50.216
It aches. It scars.
But keeps on beating.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.285
If you try and cut it out,

25:53.319 --> 25:55.321
you will lose
something essential.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.624
I can't help people
if I'm broken.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.626
You are not broken.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.628
You're the strongest
person I know.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.197
You saved me, remember?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.299
You taught me that
my loss made me stronger.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.002
That was Kara Danvers,
not Supergirl.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.708
Do you still dream about them?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.277
Your family?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.748
Sometimes.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.118
Past couple of months,
when I dream, I see...

26:28.120 --> 26:29.989
I see Mon-El

26:32.659 --> 26:33.993
with my mom.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.231
Uh...

26:39.265 --> 26:41.100
We should keep our
eyes on the sky right now.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.139
[Sawyer] Danvers, you on comms?

26:47.173 --> 26:49.308
Got something that
needs your attention.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.277
I'm here. East side. You?

26:52.044 --> 26:53.713
West. All clear.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.684
About last night...

26:57.717 --> 26:59.686
Uh... This is neither
the time nor the place

26:59.719 --> 27:01.353
to talk about what
I think you wanna talk about.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.155
Do you not wanna marry me?

27:04.423 --> 27:05.624
Of course, I do.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.129
Look, I... I wanna be
your wife. I wanna have a dog.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.731
I wanna have the house.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.432
All of it. I just...

27:13.465 --> 27:15.267
I just don't want
a big wedding.

27:15.768 --> 27:16.669
Why?

27:18.705 --> 27:21.007
Talk to me, please.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.675
You have to tell me
what's going on.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.145
Because my dad won't be there.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.948
He can't come.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.718
He can't walk me
down the aisle.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.986
You could've told me that.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.421
I didn't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.423
You're already dealing
with family issues

27:37.456 --> 27:40.727
that I can't imagine.
So, I just...

27:40.760 --> 27:43.696
I hoped that I would
just let it go.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.466
Look, I've had more practice
at choosing my family

27:47.499 --> 27:49.035
because I've had to.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.205
And I think,
if you take a deep breath,

27:55.074 --> 27:57.209
you're gonna find your
way out of this...

27:59.345 --> 28:01.047
There's so many people
who love you.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.382
Just think about how they're
gonna make our day good,

28:03.415 --> 28:05.718
and tell me how I can help.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.354
Okay. I can do that.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.256
Okay, I love you.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.391
You too. Forever.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.295
You too, my favorite couple.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.330
[Sawyer] Winn, shut up.
[Alex] Winn,
get off the comms.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.200
-[girl] Oh, sorry!
-Hey! Watch out there.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.269
Ruby! Rubes, come here, baby.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.470
Come here.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.741
I don't think
that was an apology.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.376
I'm very sorry
for bumping into you.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.245
Totally okay.
Thank you for apologizing.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.214
Can I go now, Mom?
I want to get up close.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.483
Just don't get so far ahead
I can't see you, okay?

28:38.150 --> 28:39.318
She's fun.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.421
Thanks. Just trying to enjoy
the microsecond I have left

28:42.454 --> 28:44.156
before she's a teenager.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.092
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.761
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
of National City,

28:48.795 --> 28:55.534
please welcome the chairwoman
and CEO of L-Corp, Lena Luthor.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.369
[crowd applauds]

29:01.507 --> 29:03.776
Now, I know you all
didn't come here to see me.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.344
So, I'll start
with the good stuff,

29:05.377 --> 29:08.447
and then I'll say just
a few very brief words.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.083
My fellow citizens
of National City,

29:11.483 --> 29:13.786
the Girl of Steel.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.422
[crowd applauds and cheers]

29:22.829 --> 29:24.096
There you are.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.232
[Lena] I am so honored
to be able to present

29:26.265 --> 29:28.567
this statue of our
hometown hero.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.302
Some of you must be
thinking, I know.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.572
It's a cold day in hell,
a Luthor praising a Kryptonian.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.475
But ever since I came here,

29:36.508 --> 29:38.544
she has been
an inspiration to me.

29:38.577 --> 29:42.014
She's been a mentor,
and most importantly,

29:42.048 --> 29:44.316
she's been a friend.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.386
Now would be a good time
for you to get down there
and join the crowd.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.556
[explosion]

29:50.589 --> 29:52.291
[crowd screaming]

29:56.095 --> 29:57.096
[Sam] Ruby?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.164
[glass shatters]

29:58.197 --> 30:00.299
Schott, did you see where
that missile came from?

30:00.332 --> 30:01.800
We have
no heat signature, okay,

30:01.834 --> 30:05.471
there's no atmospheric
disruption, there's no
electromagnetic trail.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.406
Alex, have you seen anything?

30:07.439 --> 30:10.442
Negative visual contact.
It came out of nowhere.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.178
Let's go, keep moving.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.080
[Winn] Okay, you know what?
We're pulling up every
security feed

30:14.113 --> 30:15.314
within a two-mile radius.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.616
There's got to be
an origin point

30:17.649 --> 30:19.451
for whatever just
hit the waterfront.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.587
J'onn, can you locate
DuBois telepathically?

30:22.388 --> 30:23.555
I'll try.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.061
[crowd screaming]

30:29.095 --> 30:30.629
I can't sense DuBois' mind.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.232
I don't get it. The cloaking
device should not be able
to cloak a missile.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.234
Then what just hit us and
where did it come from?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.406
The pressure regulator wasn't
meant for high altitude,

30:40.439 --> 30:42.274
it was meant for low altitude.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.311
They're underwater.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.131
[crowd grunting and screaming]

31:14.240 --> 31:16.375
I cannot track that explosion
to the source, you guys.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.577
The radar is not picking up
any underwater signals.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.081
I'll clear that building.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.050
Danvers, Sawyer,
stay on the waterfront.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.418
Supergirl, find that submarine.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.460
[crowd shouting]

31:40.032 --> 31:41.400
[baby crying]

31:41.433 --> 31:43.369
[water bubbling]

31:44.170 --> 31:47.073
[heart beating]

32:00.219 --> 32:01.453
She can't breathe underwater.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.296
[instrument beeping]

32:14.133 --> 32:16.035
-[explosion]
-[alarm blaring]

32:26.512 --> 32:28.447
-She's found us.
-The cloaking device is down.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.049
-Fire!
-We're not locked on.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.250
-Fire now!
-[clicks]

32:38.490 --> 32:40.226
-[crowd shouting]
-[Sam] Ruby!

32:41.460 --> 32:43.362
-Ruby!
-Mom?

32:44.063 --> 32:44.963
Ruby?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.298
Mom?

32:47.366 --> 32:48.634
[beeping]

32:49.501 --> 32:50.536
Detonate it.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.010
[explosion]

33:09.388 --> 33:11.290
[panting]

33:19.098 --> 33:20.332
Ruby!

33:23.269 --> 33:26.272
Ruby. Oh, baby. Help!

33:26.305 --> 33:27.473
Somebody help me!

33:29.841 --> 33:31.643
[grunts]

33:34.346 --> 33:35.581
[screams]

33:43.522 --> 33:45.424
[both crying]

33:54.466 --> 33:56.368
Oh, no!

33:56.402 --> 33:59.471
[Alex]
Supergirl? Supergirl?

34:06.312 --> 34:07.513
[alarm blaring]

34:07.546 --> 34:09.215
Finish them off.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.250
Kara, answer me.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.984
[Alex] Kara.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.224
Kara...

34:25.564 --> 34:27.065
Wake up!

34:31.870 --> 34:33.205
Fire!

34:40.912 --> 34:42.414
[metal creaking]

35:14.246 --> 35:16.515
[panting]

35:19.685 --> 35:21.153
[knocking at door]

35:21.920 --> 35:22.854
Come in...

35:24.690 --> 35:26.625
Oh, hey. Hey, I was
just about to call you.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.227
I should've called.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.895
I heard about the attack
at the unveiling.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.564
Oh, no. I'm fine.
Supergirl got her man.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.500
And now,
we have to discuss ours.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.302
I spoke to Edge--

35:36.335 --> 35:38.570
Please tell me you convinced
him not to buy CatCo.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.906
Well, you can't convince
a bully like that of anything.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.341
So what, CatCo's gone?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.645
No. I bought it.

35:46.678 --> 35:49.448
You're kidding...
Are you kidding?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.583
[chuckles]
Pretty badass right?

35:51.617 --> 35:54.220
I'm just trying in my own small
way to be more like Supergirl.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.854
Oh, Lena...

35:55.887 --> 35:57.656
And I was hoping maybe
you could break the story.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.558
Oh, uh...

36:00.426 --> 36:02.861
I actually quit.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.564
Well, then un-quit.
I can't do this without you.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.899
I literally know nothing about
running a media empire.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.134
Neither do I.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.204
You know more than I do.
You've studied under Cat and...

36:12.238 --> 36:14.273
I mean, I trust you.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.675
How often do you get
to work with your best friend?

36:16.708 --> 36:18.444
[footsteps approaching]

36:18.477 --> 36:21.247
You're more of a lunatic
than your brother is.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.548
Excuse me?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.150
I could ruin you.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.419
You are dangerously close to
being thrown out by security.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.389
You know what?
I'm gonna go and let you

36:30.422 --> 36:32.658
handle this.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.463
You are gonna regret,

36:37.496 --> 36:40.332
so regret, the day
you screwed me.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.000
I sure hope
you enjoyed yourself.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.835
Because now

36:44.636 --> 36:47.539
you have all of my attention.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.440
Oh, Edge, like every woman

36:48.474 --> 36:50.509
who's ever had
all of your attention,

36:50.542 --> 36:52.611
I couldn't care less.

36:54.513 --> 36:55.547
[blinds moving]

36:57.749 --> 36:59.951
Ms. Luthor...

36:59.985 --> 37:02.288
-You through with him?
-He's all yours.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.825
What do you think
you're gonna do?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.601
The attack on the waterfront...

37:16.635 --> 37:17.969
I know it was you.

37:20.038 --> 37:23.008
To clear the way
for your development.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.976
You're the only person who had
anything to gain from it.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.712
Yeah, well...

37:26.745 --> 37:28.280
You can't prove anything.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.616
Not yet.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.418
But I see you Edge.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.487
National City is my town.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.591
And now you've got
all my attention.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.665
[Edge] Hey!

37:47.666 --> 37:50.268
You can't just leave me here!

38:20.432 --> 38:21.533
Hey.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.469
Hey, Alex.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.473
You know what? I think
we both deserve a drink.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.074
Come on,
I'm buying the first round.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.910
-Since we know Winn won't.
-[chuckles]

38:31.943 --> 38:34.045
Hey, can I talk
to you about something?

38:34.079 --> 38:35.381
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.384
So, uh... Maggie and I
figured it out.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.853
We're going to have
a really big wedding.

38:41.887 --> 38:47.993
The biggest, gayest wedding
that National City has
ever seen, actually.

38:48.026 --> 38:52.864
And I'm gonna need
everybody that I love
to be there.

38:52.898 --> 38:55.401
Sure, Alex. You know
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, right?

38:55.434 --> 38:57.068
I know.

38:57.102 --> 39:01.039
But I'm gonna need
something from you.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.909
Something more than
just being there.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.417
You've always been
like a father to me.

39:11.450 --> 39:16.688
And, J'onn, I choose you
to be my family.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.690
And I want,

39:20.191 --> 39:21.527
if you will,

39:23.028 --> 39:25.564
to have you walk me
down the aisle.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.032
[choking]

39:28.033 --> 39:29.134
[exhales]

39:32.504 --> 39:33.905
Stop, don't cry.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.141
If you cry, I'm gonna cry,
and then everybody here
is gonna know

39:36.174 --> 39:37.509
that we actually can cry.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.610
[coughs]

39:38.644 --> 39:40.612
-So...
-[clears throat]

39:40.646 --> 39:42.047
Alex, it would...

39:43.081 --> 39:44.616
It would be my honor.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.018
[chuckles] Come on.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.620
[sniffles and laughs]

39:50.088 --> 39:51.389
Let me help you celebrate.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.625
Do I have to wear a tux?

39:53.659 --> 39:56.161
I'm wearing Kevlar
and boots, so...

39:56.194 --> 39:57.228
["Good For Me" playing]

39:57.262 --> 40:00.566
* What a waste
Of a smoke machine *

40:00.599 --> 40:03.034
* Took the taste
Of the dopamine *

40:03.068 --> 40:07.473
* And left me high and dry

40:09.975 --> 40:13.445
* Call the cops
Call the cavalry *

40:13.479 --> 40:15.914
* Spin the tops
That'll dazzle me *

40:15.947 --> 40:20.486
* And give me a new supply

40:24.523 --> 40:25.924
Wake up.

40:28.694 --> 40:29.995
[sighs]

40:37.102 --> 40:38.604
[keypad clicking]

40:42.708 --> 40:44.109
[message tone rings]

40:49.748 --> 40:51.149
-[bottles clinking]
-[indistinct chatting]

40:56.121 --> 40:58.657
[all laughing and chattering]

41:01.760 --> 41:04.596
* Accessorizing
Before the fact *

41:04.630 --> 41:07.032
* Alibis couldn't stay intact *

41:07.065 --> 41:10.969
* As guilty as a gun

41:13.572 --> 41:15.206
* Blasting deep underground

41:15.240 --> 41:18.610
* Getting down
To the Continental Shelf *

41:19.978 --> 41:21.613
* I'll pretend I'm surprised *

41:21.647 --> 41:24.683
* By the lies that
I'm telling to myself *

41:24.716 --> 41:27.085
* That you're good for me *

41:40.265 --> 41:42.100
[growling]

41:43.134 --> 41:45.937
[gasps and panting]
