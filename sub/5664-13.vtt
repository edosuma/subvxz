09:28.208 --> 09:30.458
a dozen unexplained

09:30.458 --> 09:31.916
animal attacks

09:30.458 --> 09:31.916
in the last ten years--

09:31.916 --> 09:33.458
all in the Jersey woods.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.875
The last reported

09:33.458 --> 09:35.875
was a couple of runners

09:35.875 --> 09:37.833
in Atlantic County Park.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.958
"Atlantic County Park."

09:37.833 --> 09:39.958
Mm.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.166
Oh, my God.

09:54.166 --> 09:57.041
Leeds.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.875
Could it be?

09:59.875 --> 10:01.416
Crane?

10:01.416 --> 10:04.125
I once met a man

10:01.416 --> 10:04.125
in Atlantic County Park--

10:04.125 --> 10:05.958
a rival scientist

10:05.958 --> 10:08.500
more than capable

10:05.958 --> 10:08.500
of creating a creature

10:08.500 --> 10:10.583
as horrific as this.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.458
It was during my apprenticeship

10:12.458 --> 10:14.625
to Benjamin Franklin.

10:21.416 --> 10:22.708
This can't be what

10:21.416 --> 10:22.708
you imagined

10:22.708 --> 10:24.916
when he offered you

10:22.708 --> 10:24.916
the position.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.333
To be the next

10:27.333 --> 10:30.833
in a long line

10:27.333 --> 10:30.833
of Franklin's whipping boys.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.291
I prefer apprentice.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.583
Ichabod Crane. You are...?

10:35.583 --> 10:36.916
Japeth Leeds.

10:36.916 --> 10:38.250
Inventor.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.541
The competition.

10:39.541 --> 10:41.000
Well, "competition"

10:41.000 --> 10:43.041
denotes comparative schools

10:41.000 --> 10:43.041
of thought.

10:43.041 --> 10:47.041
Franklin's, uh,

10:43.041 --> 10:47.041
so-called "lightning rod"

10:47.041 --> 10:50.958
is a pale imitation

10:47.041 --> 10:50.958
of my Electrostatic inducer.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.458
Where is the bloated

10:50.958 --> 10:52.458
old chap, anyway?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.000
Assuming

10:52.458 --> 10:54.000
he's wearing clothes?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.500
I expect him to arrive shortly.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.916
My time is too precious to spend

10:56.500 --> 10:59.916
in wait of a brazen Pierrot.

10:59.916 --> 11:01.666
Please pass on a message:

11:01.666 --> 11:05.458
If Franklin continues

11:01.666 --> 11:05.458
to demean my work in his

11:05.458 --> 11:07.125
execrable Almanac,

11:07.125 --> 11:09.166
I shall bring him up

11:07.125 --> 11:09.166
for a drubbing

11:09.166 --> 11:10.875
before the Continental Congress.

11:12.791 --> 11:14.166
Why?

11:17.416 --> 11:19.000
Why is your...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.791
Electrostatic inducer

11:20.791 --> 11:23.333
superior to Franklin's method

11:20.791 --> 11:23.333
of grounding?

11:23.333 --> 11:25.250
(wry, quiet laugh)

11:27.666 --> 11:29.041
The answer is simple.

11:31.041 --> 11:33.291
You chose the wrong mentor.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.541
CRANE:  Among his many brilliant,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.541
albeit dubious, achievements,

11:43.541 --> 11:45.541
Leeds sought a method

11:45.541 --> 11:47.666
to isolate animal traits

11:47.666 --> 11:50.833
in order to use them

11:47.666 --> 11:50.833
to augment humanity.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.250
Genetic mutation?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.250
No wonder he was an outcast.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.083
Leeds had come

11:55.250 --> 11:57.083
to confront Franklin

11:57.083 --> 11:58.666
over a disparaging comment

11:58.666 --> 12:02.041
made in his Almanac,

12:02.041 --> 12:03.375
which...

12:03.375 --> 12:05.166
is here.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.583
Right.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.583
Yes, here.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.541
Hello.

12:16.541 --> 12:18.333
There's a message

12:18.333 --> 12:22.291
written in

12:18.333 --> 12:22.291
Franklin's alphabet.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.750
Here: "I take no pleasure

12:24.750 --> 12:26.708
"in ridiculing Dr. Leeds.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.416
"My campaign to discredit him

12:26.708 --> 12:29.416
is due to the knowledge

12:29.416 --> 12:31.750
"that he had turned

12:29.416 --> 12:31.750
to alchemy

12:31.750 --> 12:34.166
and ancient magic."

12:34.166 --> 12:35.916
(electrical buzzing)

12:35.916 --> 12:38.791
"Having turned his back

12:35.916 --> 12:38.791

12:38.791 --> 12:43.750
"Dr. Leeds has taken

My God.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.000
Hmm?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.916
Leeds made himself a monster.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.666
Which is why he's still kicking

13:37.916 --> 13:40.666
250 years later.

13:40.666 --> 13:44.541
You said Leeds' laboratorium

13:40.666 --> 13:44.541
is in Atlantic County Park.

13:44.541 --> 13:46.750
What are the odds

13:44.541 --> 13:46.750
that it's still there?

13:52.666 --> 13:54.166
JENNY:

13:52.666 --> 13:54.166
Hey, I got something for you.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.958
Those two professors

13:54.166 --> 13:55.958
who were murdered

13:55.958 --> 13:58.666
had a few items on loan

13:55.958 --> 13:58.666
from the London Museum.

13:58.666 --> 14:01.208
A Mayan prayer mask--

13:58.666 --> 14:01.208
solid gold--

14:01.208 --> 14:02.250
and also,

14:02.250 --> 14:04.708
a Celtic plate--

14:02.250 --> 14:04.708
also solid gold.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.041
You think they were motive?

14:06.041 --> 14:07.125
I don't know, you tell me.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.125
Both artifacts were known to be

14:09.125 --> 14:11.125
vessels of the powers

14:09.125 --> 14:11.125
of the gods.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.458
I have a book on pantheistic

14:11.125 --> 14:13.458
deities back at the trailer.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.125
I'll grab it, check back in.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.708
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

14:16.708 --> 14:17.708
(phone beeps off)

14:28.166 --> 14:29.625
A Franklin stove.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.708
I thought you said Leeds

14:29.625 --> 14:31.708
hated the man.

14:31.708 --> 14:34.000
Why would he have his face

14:31.708 --> 14:34.000
in his kitchen?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
He wouldn't.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.666
A decidedly

14:38.666 --> 14:41.333
un-Franklin stove.

14:41.333 --> 14:44.208
Of Leeds' design, I believe.

14:45.666 --> 14:47.750
Leeds was an alchemist

14:47.750 --> 14:49.166
of exceeding skill.

14:50.416 --> 14:51.875
(groans)

14:51.875 --> 14:53.333
These symbols

14:53.333 --> 14:56.833

14:53.333 --> 14:56.833

14:56.833 --> 15:00.250

15:00.250 --> 15:01.625
fire.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.375
(flames whoosh)

15:01.625 --> 15:03.375
Well, it is a stove.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.916
Is it?

15:07.666 --> 15:08.625
Crane...

15:08.625 --> 15:10.166
An illusion.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.583
(rumbling, clanking)

15:24.583 --> 15:26.875
All right.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.583
I went in first

15:26.875 --> 15:29.583
last time.

16:07.541 --> 16:10.041
Lots of details, but no devil.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.416
Wherein we understand

16:10.041 --> 16:12.416
why Leeds murdered

16:12.416 --> 16:14.333
pursuing those relics

16:14.333 --> 16:16.583
and what he intends

16:14.333 --> 16:16.583
to do with them.

16:21.416 --> 16:23.291
Hmm.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.708
Built by Leeds himself,

16:23.291 --> 16:25.708
no doubt.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.041
(classical music playing)

16:39.083 --> 16:41.958
That a monster

16:39.083 --> 16:41.958
would create something

16:41.958 --> 16:44.208
of such rare beauty.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.541
"Beauty" is not the word

16:44.208 --> 16:45.541
I would use

16:45.541 --> 16:47.500
to describe this place.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.458

16:48.458 --> 16:49.458
Wow.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.625
This is the Hidden One.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.083
Was Leeds a fan?

17:07.416 --> 17:09.750
A worshipper of the Hidden One.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.500
Leeds was not drawn

17:09.750 --> 17:11.500

17:11.500 --> 17:13.416
like the other creatures

17:11.500 --> 17:13.416

20:49.541 --> 20:53.958
the Hidden One.

20:53.958 --> 20:56.875
In an era before history,

20:56.875 --> 20:59.875
from a palace that shone

20:56.875 --> 20:59.875
with a sacred light,

20:59.875 --> 21:03.541
the gods of that age

20:59.875 --> 21:03.541
ruled over humanity.

21:07.958 --> 21:12.416
Humanity lived

21:07.958 --> 21:12.416
at the whims of the gods.

21:12.416 --> 21:15.791
They lived lives

21:12.416 --> 21:15.791
of servitude and pain.

21:15.791 --> 21:18.791
One of these servants

21:15.791 --> 21:18.791
was Pandora.

21:18.791 --> 21:21.625
Each day, she delivered

21:18.791 --> 21:21.625
an offering,

21:21.625 --> 21:24.791
a sign of submission and love

21:21.625 --> 21:24.791
from her people.

21:28.708 --> 21:33.375
One of the gods had been

21:28.708 --> 21:33.375
outcast, made to live below,

21:33.375 --> 21:37.625
in the Catacombs of the Dead,

21:33.375 --> 21:37.625
hidden from the eyes of all.

21:52.583 --> 21:55.541
Why have you brought

21:52.583 --> 21:55.541
that which is forbidden?

21:57.541 --> 22:00.958
I only wanted to bring you

21:57.541 --> 22:00.958
a bit of joy.

22:07.875 --> 22:11.500
LEEDS:  In the dark depths,

22:07.875 --> 22:11.500
she was a ray of hope.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.916
Do you know why

22:18.500 --> 22:21.916
I stand guard,

22:21.916 --> 22:25.333
why I remain hidden

22:21.916 --> 22:25.333
in this place,

22:25.333 --> 22:27.458
while the others live

22:25.333 --> 22:27.458
in the light?

22:29.041 --> 22:31.708
Once, and only once,

22:31.708 --> 22:34.125
did all the gods work as one.

22:34.125 --> 22:37.916
We took all the

22:34.125 --> 22:37.916
evil in this world,

22:37.916 --> 22:39.583
and we hid it away...

22:44.458 --> 22:46.291
...in this box, Pandora.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.833
And the job of guarding it

22:56.250 --> 22:59.833
fell to me.

22:59.833 --> 23:03.125
Evil is the force

22:59.833 --> 23:03.125
that my brother above

23:03.125 --> 23:05.791
siphons into his Hourglass.

23:05.791 --> 23:09.375
The only power that

23:05.791 --> 23:09.375
could destroy him

23:09.375 --> 23:11.791
lies within that box.

23:25.833 --> 23:30.666
LEEDS:

23:25.833 --> 23:30.666
Pandora, aided by her brethren,

23:25.833 --> 23:30.666
unleashed its contents.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.666
(shrieking)

23:56.041 --> 23:59.916
LEEDS:  But humanity betrayed

23:56.041 --> 23:59.916
the Hidden One,

23:59.916 --> 24:02.916
cast him back down,

24:02.916 --> 24:05.916
locking him away forever.

24:10.041 --> 24:12.041
My God.

24:12.041 --> 24:15.041
Wait, the Mayan plate

24:12.041 --> 24:15.041
and the Celtic mask,

24:15.041 --> 24:17.041
they were made

24:15.041 --> 24:17.041
of the same primal element.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.250
Gold.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.750
Gold...

24:22.916 --> 24:25.750
This must be Leeds' plan.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.750
He's going to recreate

24:25.750 --> 24:28.750
the Golden Hourglass.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.750
The Mayan and Celtic relics

24:28.750 --> 24:30.750
are pieces of it,

24:30.750 --> 24:34.458
reappropriated at disparate

24:30.750 --> 24:34.458
cultures over millennia.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.458
Which is why

24:34.458 --> 24:36.458
the Hidden One

24:36.458 --> 24:38.083
is drawing monsters

24:36.458 --> 24:38.083
to Sleepy Hollow--

24:38.083 --> 24:39.416
so he can use their

24:38.083 --> 24:39.416
power for himself.

24:39.416 --> 24:41.791
And he needs

24:39.416 --> 24:41.791
the Hourglass to do it.

24:41.791 --> 24:45.208
LEEDS: Unexpected guests

24:41.791 --> 24:45.208
in the laboratorium?

24:45.208 --> 24:47.625
Did I leave the stove unlocked?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.958
Franklin's "key man."

24:57.958 --> 24:59.958
We meet again.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.083
My God, had I known

25:11.083 --> 25:13.083
you were still alive,

25:13.083 --> 25:17.291
we'd have had sherry

25:13.083 --> 25:17.291
and darts Friday nights.

25:17.291 --> 25:18.916
Maybe throw in some ritual

25:17.291 --> 25:18.916
murder for good measure.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.958
CRANE: You think

25:20.333 --> 25:22.958
yourself a scientist,

25:22.958 --> 25:25.625
but Franklin knew

25:22.958 --> 25:25.625
your true nature.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.041
You're an amoral

25:25.625 --> 25:28.041
abomination.

25:28.041 --> 25:30.000
(scoffs)

25:30.000 --> 25:33.041
Well, better that than ending up

25:33.041 --> 25:36.041
a shining example

25:33.041 --> 25:36.041
of mediocrity,

25:36.041 --> 25:38.458
which appears to have

25:36.041 --> 25:38.458
been your fate.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.958
Franklin knew the dangers

25:39.958 --> 25:42.083
of your brand of

25:39.958 --> 25:42.083
experimentation.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.708
By that, he means

25:42.083 --> 25:43.708
animal torture,

25:43.708 --> 25:48.291
mutation, worshipping a god bent

25:43.708 --> 25:48.291
on enslaving humanity.

25:48.291 --> 25:51.791
Bent on bestowing power

25:51.791 --> 25:54.666
to the worthy.

25:54.666 --> 25:57.125
Why should

25:54.666 --> 25:57.125
great men bow

25:57.125 --> 26:00.125
to the small-minded masses?

26:00.125 --> 26:02.958
Imagine an era

26:02.958 --> 26:07.041
where genius is rewarded,

26:02.958 --> 26:07.041
not feared.

26:07.041 --> 26:10.875
That is the promise

26:07.041 --> 26:10.875
of the Hidden One.

26:10.875 --> 26:13.666
A golden age.

26:13.666 --> 26:14.916
You're insane.

26:15.916 --> 26:17.541
No, I'm the Devil.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.708
Well, this has been a treat.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.916
Glad we got the chance

26:23.708 --> 26:25.916
to meet again, Crane.

26:25.916 --> 26:28.208
Now, which would

26:25.916 --> 26:28.208
you prefer--

26:28.208 --> 26:31.041
bleeding out quickly

26:28.208 --> 26:31.041
from a severed artery,

26:31.041 --> 26:34.166
or expiring from

26:31.041 --> 26:34.166
a paralytic toxin?

26:34.166 --> 26:35.666
How about we go

26:34.166 --> 26:35.666
with option three?

26:35.666 --> 26:37.750
You get down

26:35.666 --> 26:37.750
on the floor right now.

26:49.458 --> 26:50.541
(growls in pain)

26:58.708 --> 27:00.333
That thing is

26:58.708 --> 27:00.333
a part of him?

27:00.333 --> 27:02.666
CRANE: The tail of

27:00.333 --> 27:02.666
a deathstalker scorpion.

27:12.666 --> 27:14.416
LEEDS: All of

27:12.666 --> 27:14.416
Franklin's talk

27:14.416 --> 27:19.000
of kindred corpses

27:14.416 --> 27:19.000
rising from the dead.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.208
If only he'd embraced

27:19.000 --> 27:23.208
the elegance and power

27:23.208 --> 27:26.166
of ancient alchemy.

27:28.666 --> 27:31.666
Oh, the venom...

27:31.666 --> 27:34.250
from your tail...

27:38.291 --> 27:41.291
And if only you

27:38.291 --> 27:41.291
had come work for me

27:41.291 --> 27:43.291
when Franklin wore you down.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.875
(gasps, grunts)

27:59.541 --> 28:00.875
(Crane gasping)

28:04.416 --> 28:06.416
Crane...

28:06.416 --> 28:07.833
(groaning)

28:10.375 --> 28:11.500
Scorpion venom.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.291
ABBIE: We're in

28:13.125 --> 28:15.291
a supernatural pharmacy.

28:15.291 --> 28:17.083
There has to be something

28:15.291 --> 28:17.083
that can stop this, okay?

28:17.083 --> 28:19.416
We'll make a... antidote.

28:19.416 --> 28:20.791
(groans) Yes.

28:19.416 --> 28:20.791
ABBIE:

28:19.416 --> 28:20.791
Okay, just talk me through it.

28:20.791 --> 28:22.958
What am I looking for?

28:22.958 --> 28:24.958
ABBIE:

28:22.958 --> 28:24.958
Come on.

28:24.958 --> 28:26.166
Laudanum powder.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.250
What else?

28:28.291 --> 28:30.250
Crane, stay with me.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.750
CRANE:

28:30.250 --> 28:31.750
Magnesium sulfate.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.500
What else? Magnesium sulfate.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.500
Wait... magnesium sulfate.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
Okay, good.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.291
What else?

28:38.291 --> 28:40.125
(mutters, gasps)

28:40.125 --> 28:41.833
Leiurus quinquestriatus.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.500
ABBIE: What?

28:43.500 --> 28:45.125
CRANE: Uh, in the vial.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.333
Okay... Oh!

28:52.333 --> 28:54.333
Aah!

28:54.333 --> 28:55.666
Uh...

29:00.625 --> 29:02.625
Lieutenant?

29:02.625 --> 29:04.666
Please.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.041
(weakly):

29:11.125 --> 29:13.041
Abbie...

29:13.041 --> 29:14.666
(eerie, whispering voices)

29:27.250 --> 29:30.583
(eerie, whispering voices)

29:30.583 --> 29:32.458
ABBIE:  I've been here

29:30.583 --> 29:32.458
ten months, Crane.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.208
What do I do?

29:35.208 --> 29:36.166
(shout echoing)

29:39.208 --> 29:40.541
(gasping)

29:40.541 --> 29:42.541
Please.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.916
(grunts in pain)

29:46.916 --> 29:48.333
Damn it.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.375
Hold on, Crane.

29:49.375 --> 29:50.541
Okay.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.083
Powder.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.458
Magnesium sulfate.

29:56.541 --> 29:59.125
Stay with me, Crane.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.083
Come on, come on,

30:01.333 --> 30:03.083
come on, come on.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.458
Crane, hey...

30:14.208 --> 30:16.083
Come on, come on.

30:23.583 --> 30:24.583
Come on.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.291
(sudden gasp)

30:36.750 --> 30:38.291
(rapid gasping)

30:45.708 --> 30:48.708
I'm sorry.

30:48.708 --> 30:51.208
I was a little distracted.

30:51.208 --> 30:53.208
By that symbol.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.000
(groans)

30:59.000 --> 31:01.666
One you clutch

30:59.000 --> 31:01.666
in your hand even now.

31:04.583 --> 31:06.583
You were drawn to it,

31:04.583 --> 31:06.583
Lieutenant.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.583
It has a hold on you.

31:08.583 --> 31:13.125
If it is here,

31:08.583 --> 31:13.125
it is a thing of evil.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.333
That doesn't change the fact

31:13.125 --> 31:15.333
that I need it.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.666
And I have for months.

31:18.666 --> 31:20.083
Months?

31:20.083 --> 31:22.208
Mm.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.708
That would mean...

31:23.708 --> 31:24.958
The Catacombs,

31:24.958 --> 31:27.916
the year of solitude...

31:27.916 --> 31:29.166
(sighs)

31:29.166 --> 31:33.125
No sleep, no way to dream...

31:34.875 --> 31:38.416
There was no

31:34.875 --> 31:38.416
escaping it.

31:38.416 --> 31:40.833
I was in my head the whole time,

31:40.833 --> 31:42.708
in a bad place,

31:42.708 --> 31:45.416
and then, one day,

31:42.708 --> 31:45.416
that's when I saw it,

31:45.416 --> 31:46.833
on the temple wall.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.875
I started drawing it,

31:46.833 --> 31:49.875
tracing it...

31:49.875 --> 31:51.708
It gave me peace.

31:54.208 --> 31:57.166
Gives me peace.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.958
When soldiers return from war,

32:01.958 --> 32:05.208
they do what they need

32:01.958 --> 32:05.208
to carry on.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.666
I almost let you die.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.375
Now who's a subpar alchemist?

32:28.916 --> 32:30.416
(phone ringing)

32:31.666 --> 32:33.083
Hey.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.250
Hey. You okay?

32:34.250 --> 32:35.708
I've been better. What's up?

32:35.708 --> 32:37.666
I finally relocated

32:37.666 --> 32:39.291
that book I was

32:37.666 --> 32:39.291
telling you about.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.083
(whispers):

32:39.291 --> 32:41.083
Sorry.

32:41.083 --> 32:43.625
There's a legend

32:41.083 --> 32:43.625
in many pantheons

32:43.625 --> 32:47.083
about an item left

32:43.625 --> 32:47.083
by the ancient gods.

32:47.083 --> 32:50.000
An artifact that literally

32:47.083 --> 32:50.000
bestows omnipotence.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.375
Let me guess: an hourglass?

32:51.375 --> 32:53.166
JENNY:

32:51.375 --> 32:53.166
Containing "The Sands of Life."

32:53.166 --> 32:54.916
Apparently, there's a ceremony

32:54.916 --> 32:57.875
that can be used to take items

32:54.916 --> 32:57.875
forged from Primal Gold

32:57.875 --> 33:00.333
and reduce them

32:57.875 --> 33:00.333
to the Sands of Life.

33:00.333 --> 33:04.083
The key ingredient

33:00.333 --> 33:04.083
is the "Fire of the Gods."

33:04.083 --> 33:06.916
Thanks.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.916
Um, call you on the road.

33:06.916 --> 33:09.166
Okay, Leeds has

33:06.916 --> 33:09.166
the mask and the plate

33:09.166 --> 33:11.666
and apparently he needs

33:09.166 --> 33:11.666
the "Fire of the Gods"

33:11.666 --> 33:13.166
to make the Hourglass work.

33:13.166 --> 33:16.291
Lightning.

33:16.291 --> 33:18.458
The device he took with him,

33:18.458 --> 33:20.291
that was his

33:18.458 --> 33:20.291
electrostatic inducer.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.625
A homemade lightning rod?

33:21.625 --> 33:23.458
If he's gonna collect lightning,

33:23.458 --> 33:26.000
he's gonna need to get to

33:23.458 --> 33:26.000
the highest point in the area.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.416
Yes, I think

33:26.000 --> 33:27.416
I know where that is.

33:27.416 --> 33:29.708
Quickly, it's close.

33:35.083 --> 33:37.458
LEEDS:

33:35.083 --> 33:37.458
Praise be to he

33:37.458 --> 33:39.750
who has long been hidden.

33:39.750 --> 33:44.583
Praise be to one true God

33:39.750 --> 33:44.583
above all.

33:44.583 --> 33:48.375
With the fire of the gods,

33:48.375 --> 33:52.250
the primal gold shall

33:48.375 --> 33:52.250
be made consecrate.

33:52.250 --> 33:55.916

33:55.916 --> 33:58.791
I shall bring forth

33:58.791 --> 34:00.750
the Sands of Life.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.875
(thunder rumbling)

34:04.958 --> 34:09.000
Who's the true master of

34:04.958 --> 34:09.000
lightning now, Benjamin?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.166
ABBIE:

34:09.000 --> 34:10.166
Hold it right there.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.166

34:12.166 --> 34:14.916
You survived my venom.

34:14.916 --> 34:18.458
It appears I made

34:14.916 --> 34:18.458
the same mistake

34:18.458 --> 34:20.333
your mentor did:

34:20.333 --> 34:22.208
underestimated you.

34:22.208 --> 34:25.166
This has nothing

34:22.208 --> 34:25.166
to do with the past, Leeds.

34:25.166 --> 34:27.708
The forces with

34:25.166 --> 34:27.708
which you tamper...

34:27.708 --> 34:29.791
The Hidden One

34:27.708 --> 34:29.791
cannot be trusted.

34:29.791 --> 34:31.875
You fear him,

34:31.875 --> 34:36.250
just as those

34:31.875 --> 34:36.250
who betrayed him did, aeons ago.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.208
I shan't repeat

34:36.250 --> 34:39.208
the same mistake.

34:39.208 --> 34:42.833
I choose him as my master.

34:42.833 --> 34:47.500

34:42.833 --> 34:47.500
faithful servant

34:47.500 --> 34:49.041

34:49.041 --> 34:52.291

Beautiful, isn't it?

35:27.166 --> 35:29.250
CRANE: It's folly!

35:27.166 --> 35:29.250
Franklin would laugh

35:29.250 --> 35:32.416

35:29.250 --> 35:32.416
adolescent parlor tricks.

35:32.416 --> 35:35.416
I know what you're

35:32.416 --> 35:35.416
trying to do, Crane--

35:35.416 --> 35:39.666
goad me into jealousy.

35:39.666 --> 35:42.416
You think your delusions of

35:39.666 --> 35:42.416
grandeur will set you apart.

35:42.416 --> 35:44.458
Your master

35:42.416 --> 35:44.458
will enslave you

35:44.458 --> 35:46.416
as surely as the rest of us.

35:46.416 --> 35:48.666
I shall be rewarded for this.

35:48.666 --> 35:49.958
Sooner than you think.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.666
(Leeds grunting)

Clever ruse, Crane...

35:57.625 --> 36:01.291
(panting)

36:01.291 --> 36:03.291
I'll grant you that.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.125

36:03.291 --> 36:06.125
the greatest minds in history.

The Sands of Life...

36:27.791 --> 36:30.208
where are they?

36:35.500 --> 36:38.625
Okay, yes, the spigot

36:35.500 --> 36:38.625

Well, that's a more

36:44.166 --> 36:46.500
recent concept.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.750
Oh, can we please

36:46.500 --> 36:47.750
move past this?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.000
I mean...

36:52.000 --> 36:53.958
yes, I jumped the gun,

36:53.958 --> 36:57.250
but I think you know that

36:53.958 --> 36:57.250
my heart was in the right place.

Okay. You see, right there?
