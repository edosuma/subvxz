John had a rope around his neck,
he shit himself.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.643
All right, Esme, that'll do, yeah.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.208
Go on, go in the kitchen.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.408
Take the cars back to the money.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.448
Anyway, there's your presents.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.407
How's Arthur?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.608

19:23.080 --> 19:24.605
Off you go.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.923
Arthur, be careful with Billy
in there, there's a cock.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.081
Yeah, I will.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.082
And don't smoke that near him.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.924
All right.

19:34.000 --> 19:34.842
Get out of it.

Ada's on her way over.

Your auntie Ada's coming,
all the way from America.

Bye, chickens.

You don't have a women's lavatory
on the second floor,

20:32.360 --> 20:34.089

Different factories, different rates.

But both factories
are owned by you, Mr Shelby.

No, it's not about you.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.566
It's about disparities.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.204
It's about ten shillings a week
for working mothers

Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

22:37.320 --> 22:39.641
I will conduct myself as a businessman.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.847
Who says sweetheart.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.766
You say there's a ten shilling disparity
between male and female cutters

22:44.880 --> 22:46.450
in two of my factories.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.409
Very well.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.086
I will increase the pay
of the female cutters

22:51.160 --> 22:53.162
in this factory by five shillings

22:54.360 --> 22:56.931
and I will cut the pay
of the male cutters

22:57.080 --> 22:59.401
in the Rover by five shillings,

23:00.480 --> 23:03.165
thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.284
And I will tell the men

23:06.360 --> 23:07.771
with families to feed

23:08.560 --> 23:10.881
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.521
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.410
Oh, yeah?
A week after Christmas, you think so?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.411
You know, everything
you've said here today

23:19.480 --> 23:21.289
and the fact that
we're having this meeting today

23:22.080 --> 23:24.845
tells me that you're a woman
without a family.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.131
And everything I hear about you tells me
you're a man without a family as well.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.169
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.690
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

23:38.760 --> 23:40.364

23:40.440 --> 23:42.602

all across Birmingham.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.247

how many for dinner tomorrow.

He's new,

24:28.720 --> 24:30.609
he's foreign, he gets very upset.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.086
Right. Well, you tell chef

33:33.240 --> 33:35.208
Ada's coming today.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.850
She's late.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.041
Tommy asked about you today.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.764
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.722
Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.728
Yeah.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.087
Bentleys are no good in the cold.
You should tell him.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.361
(SIGHS) 1 will.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.280
Any other messages for Tommy?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.691
Yea h, fuck off.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.209
He saw that your drainpipe was broken.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.528
He's worried.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.885
Is that it?
Is that all he asked about, drainpipes?

34:12.960 --> 34:15.360
No, he said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.043
That you've always had a gift.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.201
What gift?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.929
Second sight.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.329
Spirits, all that gypsy stuff.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.764
He said that I'm to believe you.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.446
You think I don't hear
his voice in yours?

34:30.520 --> 34:32.443
You don't think
I recognise his strategies?

34:34.280 --> 34:36.123
- I'm still a match for him.
- Yes,

34:37.120 --> 34:38.531
you are.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.167
And you still can be.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.929
Me and Lizzie decided

34:44.000 --> 34:46.571
that this new year
we're all to turn a page.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.244
You can't spend
another year like this, Mum.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.731
Mum.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.090
Mum.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.522
Word is like a bullet to me.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.322
See your sister in that chair sometimes.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.328
Look,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.164
me and Lizzie decided.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.529
It's time.

35:27.120 --> 35:31.205
I bought these.
One for you and Ada...

35:31.920 --> 35:33.729
One for you and me.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.049
So Tommy said, keep her off the whisky?

35:42.120 --> 35:43.246
I'll drink champagne

35:43.320 --> 35:46.210
the day my son leaves the employment
of Shelby Company Ltd.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.330
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.330
Right, now, this is your job, Charlie.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.007
Now, give those to Santa,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.490
and Rudolf.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.766
Good boy.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.203
Leave this out for Santa,
that's whisky.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.090
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.801
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right? Sleep well.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.882
Come on, Charlie.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

37:54.920 --> 37:56.206
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.449
I know. Send her in.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.009
I've had a card, Ada. I'm guessing
Arthur and john have had one as well.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.446
"Hello, Tommy."
"Hello, Ada, welcome home."

38:12.520 --> 38:15.205
"Thanks, it's nice
to be back." (CHUCKLES)

38:17.600 --> 38:18.442
I've spoken to Moss.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.691
Moss says that Chang retta
is a soldier for the Spinetta family,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.967
which means that he'll have men
with him, professional men.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.010
They usually operate
in units of around ten.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.885
Moss is checking Cunard records
to see if they're already in England.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.409
This one's for you.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.885
What is it, a time machine?

38:35.640 --> 38:38.530
My God, Tommy Shelby, is that regret?

38:39.240 --> 38:40.924
I'll open it tomorrow.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.964
So, boss, in light of the changed
circumstances, what are your orders?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.770
Changretta knows where we all live.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.850
If we stay out in the open, isolated,
he'll pick us off one by one.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.486
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.760
You mean, back home?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.690
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

39:05.760 --> 39:07.762
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.490
I'm calling a family meeting.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.210
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.451
Finn's already there.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.727
You tell Polly and Michael,
I'll deal with john and Arthur.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.211
And Esme and Linda?

39:19.720 --> 39:21.643
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

39:21.720 --> 39:24.769
needs to come where it's safe.
These bastards will kill kids as well.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.327
When this business is finished we can...

39:27.400 --> 39:29.129
go our separate ways.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.165
Go and see Polly and explain.
She'll have had a card as well.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.244
Do you think I'm on the list?

39:39.760 --> 39:41.762
We're all on the list, Ada.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.091
I gave my gun to Arthur.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.606
Welcome home.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.566
Hm.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.329
Holy shit.

40:25.400 --> 40:28.244
- It's Father Christmas.
- Yeah.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.448
And if you're good

40:30.520 --> 40:32.488
you get what you deserve.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.210
Fucking come here, you.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.961
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

Family meeting, Charlie's Yard,
Boxing Day, midday.

41:39.440 --> 41:42.410
I can't raise john
but I'll send Michael to get him.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.646
If you have to pull a gun
on Linda, do it.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.529
Merry Christmas.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.442
Merry Christmas, Tom.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.125
What did you do with them?

42:07.120 --> 42:09.566
My tablets were in the bathroom cabinet.
What did you do with them?

42:11.040 --> 42:13.042
I threw them in the lavatory.

42:14.360 --> 42:17.091
- Tommy's orders?
- No. My own decision.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.444
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them? They close everything.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.604
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them?

42:27.680 --> 42:29.762
- I'll help you.
- They don't open anything.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.251
Fucking no apocethary, nothing.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.688
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.128
How am I gonna get through
fucking Christmas,

42:38.200 --> 42:40.089
without... without anything?

42:40.680 --> 42:43.729
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:45.520 --> 42:47.409
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

42:47.480 --> 42:51.849
Fuck off. Fuck off.
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby. Fuck off.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.127
It's all right, it was me.
I just want you to stop, just stop.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.043
- I just want the tablets.
- This has got to stop!

42:56.120 --> 42:58.600
Tommy said to believe in spirits
with you but I can't.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.842
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.371
Merry Christmas.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.411
Door was wide open.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.361
Fuck.

43:08.440 --> 43:11.523
I spent the whole day tidying up,
I wanted it to be nice.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.565
I wanted it to look nice.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.881
All right, Poll, it's only me.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.281
It's okay. It's okay, we can sit.

43:18.560 --> 43:22.451
Sit and talk, we'll put things
back together. It's okay.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.887
- I'll leave you two to it.
- No, you stay.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.606
Now listen, something's happened.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.409
Things have changed.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.480
Today, everyone in the family

43:36.320 --> 43:38.322
received one of these.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.804
- What does it mean?
- Tommy's called a family meeting.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.569
He wants you both to come.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.849
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

44:05.200 --> 44:07.009
Come.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.211
I'm really sorry
to bother you again, sir,

44:16.280 --> 44:18.806
but chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.809
Frances, for the last time,

44:23.800 --> 44:25.484
it's johnny Dogs,

44:25.560 --> 44:26.800
they're gypsies,

44:26.880 --> 44:28.245
they're camped down by the river.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.721
When they're ready they'll walk up.
All right?

44:31.800 --> 44:34.326
- He says it's about preparation, sir.
- What is?

44:34.400 --> 44:36.721
He's asked specifically,

44:36.800 --> 44:39.121
will they arrive
before the King's speech or after?

44:44.400 --> 44:46.402
You said he was new, this chef.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.801
- When did he join us?
- October.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.089
October.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.930
And he's foreign?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.490
- He's Italian, sir.
- Oh.

45:04.480 --> 45:06.767
He's the best chef
we've ever had in the house.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.961
No shouting or swearing or blaspheming.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.408
- Do we know his references?
- Yes.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.728
The only problem has been his assistant.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.287
What assistant?

45:19.360 --> 45:22.603
He brought an assistant with him,
he calls him his sous chef.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.283
Are they still working, Frances?

45:29.440 --> 45:31.044
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.643
All right, thank you.
Goodnight, you can go to bed.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.440
Merry Christmas, sir.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.131
And I thought about your offer,

45:47.320 --> 45:49.129
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

45:51.080 --> 45:52.730
All right, thank you.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.889
Mr Shelby.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.966
What's your name?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.724
- Max, Mr Shelby.
- Max.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.089
It's all right, don't get up.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.209
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sir.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.808
You knew I'm Mr Shelby?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.166
Hello, sir.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.971
I haven't taken time
to introduce myself.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.200
Antonio.

47:00.080 --> 47:02.082
What have you done that's so wrong, eh?

47:03.520 --> 47:04.851
Excuse me?

47:04.920 --> 47:07.491
Sous chef, peeling potatoes?

47:09.920 --> 47:12.082
It's an emergency, late notice.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.491
Oh, late notice.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.761
All right.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.682
All right, carry on.

47:28.560 --> 47:29.561
Antonio...

47:31.240 --> 47:33.049
Here, £10.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.529
For the late notice.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.282
(CHOPPING)

48:14.840 --> 48:16.444
You wanted to know
if my guests would arrive

48:16.520 --> 48:18.807
before or after the King's speech.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.249
- Eh?
- Yeah.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.602
It'll be after.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.123
How are you?

48:39.200 --> 48:41.771
Just... worried about tomorrow.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.804
Yeah, I'm worried about Antonio.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.968
He's been here two months
and we've not met before, it's my fault.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.881
I've been busy.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.204
Thomas Shelby.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.487
- My hand has blood.
- Oh, mine too.

49:08.880 --> 49:12.680
Hey, how much do you pay Antonio?

49:15.400 --> 49:17.129
I forget.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.168
Must be a lot.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.810
I just gave him £10,

49:21.760 --> 49:23.330
didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.206
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

49:42.520 --> 49:43.851
I've been reading up on you.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.447
Bertorelli, Claridge's.

49:47.440 --> 49:50.569
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's...

49:52.000 --> 49:53.445
OH...

49:54.400 --> 49:55.447
on Fleet Street.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.488
I used to know the man
that owns San Marco's.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.160
A man called Darby Sabini?

50:05.360 --> 50:07.089
- I've never met him.
- No.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.682
Maybe your, um, assistant...

50:11.600 --> 50:13.602
Antonio, maybe he's met him.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.088
- Here's how it is.
-(GRUNTS)

50:18.160 --> 50:20.811
- Antonio was sent from New York?
- I don't know, please.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.649
Darby Sabini facilitated.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.200
He passed him onto you,
told you to bring him into my house,

50:25.280 --> 50:27.362
threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.082
Do you want me to dress you
like you dressed that fucking stag?

50:31.200 --> 50:32.725
Please, don't...

50:35.640 --> 50:37.165
- You know about me?
- Mmm-mmm.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.443
All right.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.409
- You know what I do?
- Mmm.

50:43.440 --> 50:44.805
You wanted to know
when my guests would arrive

50:44.880 --> 50:46.609
'cause Antonio needed me alone.

50:47.200 --> 50:50.249
He's an assassin,
the plan is to kill me tomorrow.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.808
I don't know.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.488
They just said bring him here.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.409
Well, bring him here.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.160
Antonio...

51:11.840 --> 51:14.491
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

51:44.280 --> 51:46.760
Oh. (SPEAKING ITALIAN)

51:48.920 --> 51:50.206
Huh?

51:50.280 --> 51:52.248
(SCREAMS)

52:05.760 --> 52:07.569
You're a black hand!

52:08.520 --> 52:10.284
