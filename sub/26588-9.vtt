WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.380
Dre: What's one thing we all
know Black people don't like?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.960
Camping.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.040
An overwhelming majority
of national park visitors

00:09.040 --> 00:10.620
are White.

00:10.620 --> 00:13.830
Only 7% of national park
visitors are Black.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.380
And they probably just got lost
on the way to Vegas.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.380
The only good thing
about camping

00:19.380 --> 00:22.880
is all those comedies about
White people in the woods.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.920
Oh! That boulder got him!

00:25.920 --> 00:27.330
Should've stayed home!

00:27.330 --> 00:28.670
Oh, my God.
Ha!

00:28.670 --> 00:29.920
Buh-bye, arm.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.960
Whoo!
Oh, my God.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.750
The wilderness remains

00:32.750 --> 00:35.750
undefeated
against White people!
Oh, my God.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.460
Man #1: I told you
this would be a mistake.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.330
I thought
this would be funnier.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.670
It's not funny!

00:43.670 --> 00:47.040
So I choose to honor
the great men and women

00:47.040 --> 00:49.580
who didn't have a choice
about being outside

00:49.580 --> 00:52.670
by keeping my Black ass inside.

00:52.670 --> 00:56.420
Which is why I was
so horrified to hear this.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.040
You need to take
Jack and Diane camping.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
What?!

01:04.380 --> 01:06.210
Look, I can't
take them camping.
Why?

01:06.210 --> 01:07.750
I don't know
anything about it.

01:08.750 --> 01:09.920
The woods or --

01:09.920 --> 01:11.330
or how to set up that --

01:11.330 --> 01:13.920
that sleeping
triangle thing.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.080
The tent?

01:15.080 --> 01:16.290
See? See?

01:16.290 --> 01:17.500
You're already
miles ahead of me.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.580
Oh, my God.
Have fun tonight!

01:18.580 --> 01:20.460
Oh, no, no, no, Dre.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.790
I have surgery tonight.

01:22.790 --> 01:26.210
And it is not
just any surgery.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.880
It is my chance

01:27.880 --> 01:29.290
at a SHLEB.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.210
A SHLEB?

01:30.210 --> 01:31.710
Have you ever heard
of the EGOT?

01:31.710 --> 01:33.170
Ruby: Yeah, yeah.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.420
That's when you win an Emmy,

01:35.420 --> 01:37.920
Grammy, Oscar, and a Tony.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.000
Mm-hmm.
Whoopi has one.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.210
Dre and Rainbow: Yep.

01:40.210 --> 01:41.210
A real one.

01:41.210 --> 01:42.670
Streisand walking around

01:42.670 --> 01:45.000
like that honorary Tony
counts.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.540
It does not.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.330
Well, the equivalent

01:48.330 --> 01:49.880
for an anesthesiologist

01:49.880 --> 01:51.500
is the SHLEB --

01:51.500 --> 01:54.330
spine, heart, lungs,

01:54.330 --> 01:56.750
eyes, and the brain.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.170
I finally get a brain!

01:58.960 --> 02:00.830
Easy, Scarecrow.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.380
The only thing you should
be asking the Wizard for

02:03.380 --> 02:04.750
is nicer feet.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.710
Y--

02:06.710 --> 02:08.250
-John Legend got an EGOT?
-Mm-hmm.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.830
-Seems young.
-I know.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.830
-Do we like him?
-We like him.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.880
Let me see.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.290
Ohh.

02:14.290 --> 02:15.290
Oh, we like him.

02:15.290 --> 02:16.500
Yeah.
Hey, hey. Oh, yeah!

02:16.500 --> 02:17.880
Anyway, Dre,

02:17.880 --> 02:19.750
you have got to
take the kids camping.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.380
It's for
science extra credit.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.500
Can't they just get some other
kids to sign in for them?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
It's not even
really camping.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.960
You're gonna put a tent
on the football field at school,

02:28.960 --> 02:31.460
and it's an opportunity

02:31.460 --> 02:33.540
for you to have fun
with the twins.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.000
We always have fun!

02:35.000 --> 02:37.330
We ate nachos
and played "NBA 2K"

02:37.330 --> 02:39.040
for four hours
last night

02:39.040 --> 02:41.540
when I told you
I was working.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.170
Kiss the controller.

02:43.170 --> 02:43.960
Kiss the controller.

02:45.420 --> 02:47.000
This trade is gonna
turn the Clippers around.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.330
Trade rejected?!

02:53.330 --> 02:55.210
You !
Dang it!
You kidding?!

02:55.210 --> 02:56.670
We're basically triplets.

02:56.670 --> 02:57.960
Watch this.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.290
Jack!
-Yeah?

02:59.290 --> 03:01.000
-Diane?
-What?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.920
Hey, you guys want to sleep

03:02.920 --> 03:05.830
inside or outside tonight?

03:05.830 --> 03:07.540
Both: Inside!

03:07.540 --> 03:09.580
Hm. Just like their daddy.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.330
You are still
taking them camping.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.620
I know that.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.330
But if you think
I'm just gonna roll over

03:14.330 --> 03:15.880
because it's the right thing
to do, then...

03:17.000 --> 03:19.250
...you don't know me.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.040
And you've never
known me.

03:21.040 --> 03:21.960
Okay.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.960
Look at all these
smiling idiots.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.080
How comfortable must you be

03:28.080 --> 03:30.040
in your life for you to choose

03:30.040 --> 03:31.420
to be homeless for a night?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.460
For fun.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.210
Grab my damn bag, Janine.

03:34.210 --> 03:36.500
"Grab my damn bag, Mom."

03:36.500 --> 03:37.920
Kids today.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.120
Hey, Dre.
How are you?

03:39.120 --> 03:40.830
I'm gonna see you
in there, right?

03:40.830 --> 03:42.620
Can't wait
to sleep with you!

03:42.620 --> 03:44.250
That's a joke.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.790
Oh, I love roughing it.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.250
It's become clear to me

03:47.250 --> 03:48.830
that...

03:48.830 --> 03:49.960
...I'm gonna die here.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.920
Pfft. Camping.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.750
All the inconveniences
of the apocalypse

03:53.750 --> 03:54.790
and none of the fun.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.080
We should be
spending tonight

03:56.080 --> 03:58.420
going down an awesome
YouTube spiral.
Mm.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.250
What are LeBron James'
top five steals?

04:00.250 --> 04:01.290
Mm.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.920
What is a smart
and easy way

04:02.920 --> 04:04.420
to lose belly fat?

04:04.420 --> 04:05.620
I mean, I don't know.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.120
I'm not gonna
find out now.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.540
Man: Warm fires,
stars above, tasty groove.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.830
-You said it, baby.
-One, two, three, unh!

04:13.830 --> 04:14.880
Dad rock!

04:14.880 --> 04:16.830
If that's gonna be

04:16.830 --> 04:18.000
a part of this,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.830
we can't be here.

04:19.830 --> 04:20.920
Ohh!

04:22.960 --> 04:24.000
What choice
do we have?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.330
What about
this choice?

04:28.330 --> 04:31.080
We sign in,
show our smiling faces,

04:31.080 --> 04:32.790
get the extra credit,

04:32.790 --> 04:36.080
and then, boom,
spend a luxurious night

04:36.080 --> 04:39.420
in a suite
at the Four Seasons.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.330
Can we play video games
until I fall asleep

04:41.330 --> 04:42.880
with the controller
in my hand?
Done.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.290
Can we eat
at the hotel restaurant

04:44.290 --> 04:46.500
and charge it
to some stranger's room?
Done.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.250
Can I send a fax
from the business center?

04:48.250 --> 04:50.790
Is there any other way
to send a fax?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.460
Done! Ha ha!

04:52.460 --> 04:54.290
And just in case your mother
calls around looking for us,

04:54.290 --> 04:56.540
we'll check in the hotel
under the names

04:56.540 --> 04:58.750
Quavo, Offset,
and Takeoff.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.420
Drip, drip!
Both: Splash!

05:00.420 --> 05:02.670
Let's get this camping garbage
over with.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.620
Man: Hey!

05:04.620 --> 05:06.420
Thataway.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.380
Well, that's that.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.250
Just another routine bifrontal
craniotomy in the books.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.420
Nothing special
about that.

05:12.420 --> 05:15.920
Actually, that was
my first brain surgery.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.500
Wait, what?
Swear to God.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.540
You've never done
a brain surgery before?

05:19.540 --> 05:22.210
But you have done a spine,
heart, lungs, and eyes?

05:22.210 --> 05:23.040
Yeah.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.290
Well, that means...

05:25.500 --> 05:27.540
All: Surprise!

05:27.540 --> 05:30.290
Oh, my God!

05:30.290 --> 05:32.500
I didn't know
you were gonna do this!

05:32.500 --> 05:34.460
But I was hoping
you were gonna do this.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.920
I'm pretending
that I don't want this,

05:35.920 --> 05:37.670
but I really,
really want this!

05:37.670 --> 05:38.790
Oh, my God!

05:38.790 --> 05:40.170
Well, we're very happy
to do it.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.540
You know, you are a bit of
a SHLEB-rity around these parts.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.040
Oh, you're hilarious!

05:45.040 --> 05:46.000
Oh, there she is!
Oh, look. A plaque.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.620
As I always say,

05:47.620 --> 05:49.380
the party doesn't start until
the neurosurgeon gets here.

05:49.380 --> 05:50.580
No one says that.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.500
Nice job back there.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
Ohh!
The bifrontal craniotomy,

05:55.500 --> 05:58.170
that's not an easy surgery
for anesthesiologists.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.830
Ohh!
Thank you, Dr. Cole.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.420
I just put him to sleep

06:01.420 --> 06:03.380
and then woke him up
again mid-surgery

06:03.380 --> 06:05.330
and then put him back to sleep
and made sure he didn't die.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.750
So it was nothing.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.000
Now, I-I don't know
much about you.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.540
What's your story?

06:10.540 --> 06:12.880
Where -- Where'd you
go to medical school?
USC.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.380
Huh, wow.
Yeah.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.290
That's a really
good school.
Yeah.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.880
Good for you.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.330
Good...for me,
yeah.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.460
Dr. Windsor: All right,
you guys, say cheese!

06:21.460 --> 06:23.290
Here we go! Cheese!

06:23.290 --> 06:24.750
Mr. Solomon: It's happening!

06:24.750 --> 06:27.580
It's really happening!
Oh ho!

06:27.580 --> 06:30.500
Good afternoon,
students and parents,

06:30.500 --> 06:34.580
and welcome to
the Valley Glen Campout!

06:36.420 --> 06:37.880
I love nature!

06:37.880 --> 06:40.290
I love nature!
Whoo-hoo! What fun.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.170
Now, everybody,
I am Mr. Solomon,

06:42.170 --> 06:43.960
the environmental science
teacher.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.120
Welcome to
the environment.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.830
And right now,
I want everyone

06:47.830 --> 06:51.330
to really notice
the nature around them.

06:51.330 --> 06:53.790
And right now, I want
everybody to close your eyes

06:53.790 --> 06:57.880
and listen,
really listen.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.420
Oh, my goodness!
What is that?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.290
Is that
a coyote I hear?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.170
Dre:
Is this the guy

07:06.170 --> 07:07.960
I leave you guys with
every day?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.790
He bikes
to work, Dad.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.000
He's the reason we don't
have straws anymore.

07:14.620 --> 07:17.710
Okay, now, everybody,
it is time to unplug.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.380
The camp staff is
gonna be coming around

07:19.380 --> 07:22.330
to make sure that this is
a screen-free zone.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.080
Let's plug into nature!

07:24.080 --> 07:25.920
Junior: All right.
Phones, please.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.920
Junior.
Phones.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.040
What are you
doing here?

07:28.040 --> 07:29.750
The school alumni
e-blast

07:29.750 --> 07:31.580
said they were looking
for volunteers.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.670
They call, I listen.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.040
So, I'm gonna need
that phone, big guy.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.500
Enh-enh.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.380
I learned my lesson
at the Drake concert.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.920
If I want shaky footage
of "Passionfruit,"

07:40.920 --> 07:42.330
that's my decision.

07:42.330 --> 07:43.420
Not his.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.750
Fine, keep it.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.210
But Mother Nature
gives her likes in person.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.120
Hmm.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.580
Come on.
Phones in.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.120
Pay up, come on.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.790
Thank you.

07:53.790 --> 07:54.920
Look here, guys.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.540
I'm gonna need you
to make your rounds,

07:56.540 --> 07:58.380
show your pretty faces,
and get that extra credit,

07:58.380 --> 08:01.290
and be back here
in an hour, all right?

08:01.290 --> 08:03.210
We'll be at the hotel
before sunset,

08:03.210 --> 08:05.210
just like Dr. King
would've wanted.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.750
"Four Seasons" on three.
One, two, three.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.000
All: Four Seasons.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.670
Mr. Solomon: What I love
the most about a leaf

08:10.670 --> 08:12.250
is the veins, right?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.580
Yeah,
I like to just --

08:13.580 --> 08:15.540
-Oh!
-Oh! Hey.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.080
Your bike fell.
-Oh, no.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.380
Oh, hey. Hey.
Sorry. Dre Johnson.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.170
-Hi.
-Yeah, hi, I was here. Okay.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.040
Lunch box!
I'm here!

08:23.040 --> 08:24.500
Dre Johnson!
You see me!

08:29.080 --> 08:30.330
Hey, hey. Squat down
for this picture, guys.

08:30.330 --> 08:31.620
Come on.
Jailhouse style. Ah!

08:31.620 --> 08:34.380
I love how we're documenting
our camping experience --

08:34.380 --> 08:36.380
every single one of us,
including me.

08:36.380 --> 08:37.830
Hey, I love
roughing it.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.830
Valley Glen
Camping Trip 2019!

08:41.460 --> 08:43.250
As you can see, these are
different-colored eggs

08:43.250 --> 08:46.380
from birds
all over California.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.380
Hey, guys, let's go.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.880
All right,
the concierge level

08:48.880 --> 08:50.750
only has the slider bar
from 4:00 to 6:00.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.250
One second, Dad.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.420
So, you're saying that eggs come
in different colors,

08:54.420 --> 08:56.880
and I've been dyeing them
on Easter like a jerk?
Yep!

08:56.880 --> 08:59.290
It's all part of Mother Nature's
colorful tapestry.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.460
Now, who can pick the egg
from my favorite bird --

09:01.460 --> 09:04.420
and I love saying it --
the snowy plover?

09:04.420 --> 09:05.960
-Oh, it's this bespeckled one.
-Ding, ding, ding!

09:05.960 --> 09:07.420
Diane,
that is excellent!

09:07.420 --> 09:09.210
Uh, how did you
know that?

09:09.210 --> 09:11.040
We had an avian
biology unit.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.210
A what?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.790
I get what you're doing.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.620
You want
everybody to remember

09:17.620 --> 09:20.040
how Diane laid
all that egg knowledge down.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.500
Girl, you are smart.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.830
Okay, I'll go start the car.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.620
Wait, but Mr. Solomon's gonna
let us touch a condor egg.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.670
Excuse me?
We've never touched
a condor egg.

09:28.710 --> 09:30.790
Oh, a condor egg.
Yeah.

09:30.790 --> 09:33.250
All right, off-white,
kind of round, in a shell?

09:33.250 --> 09:34.080
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.920
Yeah, that's every egg.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.500
All right, if you like eggs
so much, man, we can order some

09:37.500 --> 09:39.170
up to the room and you can
touch them all you want.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.170
Come on.
Diane, back me up here.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.790
This sucks.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.540
I didn't think
I would,

09:44.540 --> 09:47.500
but I'm kind of
having a good time.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.250
-What?
-All right, everybody,

09:49.250 --> 09:52.250
it is time to carve
flutes out of reeds!

09:52.250 --> 09:54.250
Oh, my God.
What you're looking at
is 3 yards of music,

09:54.250 --> 09:56.460
so let's get fluting!

09:56.460 --> 09:58.620
Oh, yeah, we are
definitely staying, Dad.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.380
I mean, you never walk away from
an authorized use of knives.

10:01.380 --> 10:05.460
Follow me, future flautists!
Follow me!

10:05.460 --> 10:08.080
Did you hear what Dr. Cole
said to me at the party?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.500
What do you mean?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.540
You were standing
right there.
Mm-hmm.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.210
I said I went to USC,
and she was like,

10:14.210 --> 10:17.250
"Wow.
That's such a good school.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.670
Good for you."

10:18.670 --> 10:21.710
Yeah, well, USC is
a really good school.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.120
And you went there.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.460
And that is good.
For...you.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.830
Yeah, but did you hear
the way she said it?

10:28.830 --> 10:31.420
She acted surprised
that I got in.

10:31.420 --> 10:32.540
You know what it means
when people say

10:32.540 --> 10:33.750
"Good for you,"
don't you?

10:33.750 --> 10:36.580
Come on. It means
they have low expectations.

10:36.580 --> 10:39.120
They think I got in
because of the diversity slot.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.460
Hmm...
Mm-hmm.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.330
Don't you think you might be
reading a lot into that?

10:42.330 --> 10:44.500
No, I think that's
a textbook micro-aggression.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.790
How often do people ask you
what school you went to?

10:46.790 --> 10:48.210
Not a lot,
and that's a good thing

10:48.210 --> 10:49.830
because people are not
reassured when they hear

10:49.830 --> 10:52.210
"Medical College of Tobago --
South Campus."

10:52.210 --> 10:53.710
What -- Is that --
Yeah.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.750
The look on their faces --
they just go

10:55.750 --> 10:58.290
But listen, I think she was just
trying to pay you a compliment.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.420
Maybe you're being
a little too sensitive.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.330
I'm being
too sensitive?
Yeah.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.880
That's your takeaway?
Yeah, you know?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.170
Sometimes things are just
what they are at face value.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.790
Mm...
Okay?

11:09.790 --> 11:11.040
Have a good
rest of your day,

11:11.040 --> 11:12.380
and what I mean
by that is,

11:12.380 --> 11:14.710
have a good
rest of your day.

11:14.710 --> 11:15.960
-Yeah, I get it.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.750
It's very funny.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.210
Unbelievable.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.580
Fun fact, everybody.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.120
With only a slightly
uncomfortable hand contortion,

11:24.120 --> 11:27.670
the reed flute can double
as a reusable straw.

11:27.670 --> 11:30.210
And let me tell you something.
The oceans will thank you.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.210
This guy
and his straws.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.330
Great.

11:35.330 --> 11:36.790
The hotel website says

11:36.790 --> 11:38.580
the rooftop hot tub
is closed.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.620
I hope you're happy.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.500
Now we have to use
the ground-level hot tub

11:42.500 --> 11:44.920
like we're some
contest winners from Iowa.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.000
Dad, camping is
actually pretty great.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.540
-Really?
-Yeah, you made it sound

11:48.540 --> 11:50.460
like this was going to be
the worst thing ever.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.750
Have you ever
even been camping before?

11:52.750 --> 11:55.210
I've never been murdered before,
but I know that sucks.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.670
We're already here,
and we're having fun.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.040
Why can't you just
give it a chance?

12:00.040 --> 12:02.580
Yeah, I didn't think I was gonna
like Fruit by the Foot,

12:02.580 --> 12:05.500
but now that's the only way
I eat fruit.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.710
Come on.
Be open.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.580
Fine.
I'll give it a try.

12:09.580 --> 12:13.210
Junior:
That sounds like a man ready
to make a friendship bracelet.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.670
Insider tip --
you're gonna want to make it

12:14.670 --> 12:15.880
longer than you think.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.290
You can always cut,
but you can't add.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.120
Dre:

12:21.120 --> 12:23.750
So, for the sake
of my kids, I tried.

12:23.750 --> 12:26.620
I even played Bird Bingo.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.460
Ooh, it's a scrub jay!
Look, look! Look over there!

12:29.500 --> 12:31.790
Ah, I see it, too!

12:31.790 --> 12:33.170
Let me confirm.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.120
Ah, yep.
You found a beauty.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.790
Child:
Whoo! Bird Bingo!

12:37.790 --> 12:39.290
We'll see about that.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.750
Don't give her
the prize yet!

12:41.750 --> 12:43.080
Oh, my God,
Jack, look!

12:43.080 --> 12:45.750
I'm only a gold finch
and a sparrow away

12:45.750 --> 12:47.040
from Bird Bingo.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.830
Well, on my bird card,
I got

12:48.830 --> 12:51.880
hot, teriyaki,
and lemon pepper.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.540
Shh. I'm trying
to concentrate.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.330
Really?

12:54.330 --> 12:55.750
Why?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.960
Because there is literally
no stakes to this.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.120
Guys, I offered
a luxurious hotel weekend

13:02.120 --> 13:04.500
jammed into one night!

13:04.500 --> 13:06.330
That's the kind of stuff
you give to a mistress.

13:06.330 --> 13:08.000
Dad, you're scaring
the birds!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.540
I don't care
about the birds, son!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.830
You didn't care about them
until 20 minutes ago.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.500
Come on, guys.
You can't possibly like this.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.210
So, we're not allowed to like
stuff that you don't like?

13:19.210 --> 13:21.040
Yes.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.620
Finally!
Thank you! Thank you.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.080
Come on.
Let's go to the hotel.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.120
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!

13:27.670 --> 13:29.170
You can go, Dad.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.880
Yeah, we'll stay here
with Junior.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.000
Really?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.380
Okay, fine.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.040
I'll go to the hotel
without you.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.380
Daddy out.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.000
Good night to you,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.880
and good night to you.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.380
And FYI,

13:44.380 --> 13:46.880
I didn't pack a tent.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.210
Good luck, suckers!

13:50.380 --> 13:51.670
Coo-coo!

13:51.670 --> 13:53.330
Coo-coo!

13:53.330 --> 13:54.710
It's a ghetto owl.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.080
So, I got away from camping,
and I got my revenge on birds.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.960
Hot, teriyaki, and lemon pepper.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.120
Bingo, you flying bastards!

14:09.540 --> 14:11.170
Mm.
Hello, extra ranch.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.170
Hey --

14:14.500 --> 14:15.880
Ah.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.580
You're not extra ranch.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.710
What are you
doing here?

14:19.710 --> 14:21.120
Jack and Diane with you?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.670
They can come in, but they
can't have any of my wings.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.080
No, I'm alone.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.710
Just came
to check on you.

14:26.710 --> 14:28.420
Mm-hmm. Okay.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.120
That was
a pretty dramatic exit,

14:30.120 --> 14:33.380
right up there with when you got
thrown out of Dodger Stadium

14:33.380 --> 14:35.250
for not giving a foul ball
to a kid.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.880
I didn't know
it was his wish.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.290
Look, I know you hate
that Jack and Diane

14:41.290 --> 14:43.330
are starting to like things
that you don't.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.040
Up until now,
they basically only liked

14:45.040 --> 14:45.960
whatever
you told them to.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.330
Hey, not true.

14:47.330 --> 14:49.420
Jack's favorite movie
is "Juice."

14:49.420 --> 14:51.460
He came to that
on his own.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.250
And look, man.
I don't care.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.500
I'm never, ever
going to like camping.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.580
Black people don't camp.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.250
It's wrong.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.460
This sounds
really familiar.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.500
Eh --

15:02.500 --> 15:04.710
When I was
Diane and Jack's age,

15:04.710 --> 15:07.420
you took me to see
"Harry Potter," and I loved it.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.080
But you said
you hated it

15:09.080 --> 15:11.210
because Black people
weren't into wizards.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.580
I stand by that.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.670
Yeah, but that's
when you decided

15:14.670 --> 15:17.250
you weren't into a lot of
the stuff I was getting into.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.170
So we pretty much stopped
doing things together.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.920
Son, what are you
talking about, man?

15:21.920 --> 15:22.880
We do things together.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.250
You're my favorite.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.460
Oh, Dad,
let's not do this.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.580
Okay. You know you're at least
in the top five for sure.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.500
See that?

15:32.500 --> 15:33.960
Hey, man.
We mess with each other.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.620
We have a back-and-forth,
and...

15:36.620 --> 15:37.880
I think
that's kind of cool.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.920
Yeah,
actually, it is.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.210
But we could've
had more.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.210
True.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.120
The window's still open
with the twins.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.960
I hear you.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.500
Ooh, I don't know about
this "La La Land," Devante.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.250
Ryan Gosling is saving jazz
from John Legend?

16:03.250 --> 16:05.080
I don't think so.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.620
Hey.
-Oh, oh.

16:07.620 --> 16:08.750
I wasn't, uh...

16:09.960 --> 16:12.580
I wasn't giving him
screen time and Pringles.

16:12.580 --> 16:14.750
It's fine.
Nothing matters.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.080
What's wrong with you?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.120
Do you ever feel like
you see something

16:17.120 --> 16:19.460
that no one else
can see?

16:19.460 --> 16:22.080
Are you talking about that ghost
in the laundry room?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.210
No, everybody knows
about him.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.170
This surgeon said
something to me

16:27.170 --> 16:30.210
that I think was kind of racist,
but no one else could see it.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.250
What'd he say?

16:31.250 --> 16:33.080
She.
She?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.670
Yes, Ruby.
Women can be doctors.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.580
Not my doctors!

16:38.580 --> 16:40.000
Oh, my God.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.330
They got to be older than me,
more man than me,

16:43.330 --> 16:45.420
and more Jewish than me.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.380
I'm from
a different time.

16:47.380 --> 16:51.210
Well, she acted
overly surprised

16:51.210 --> 16:52.920
that I went to USC.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.880
-And that's your problem?
-Yes.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.710
It was an insult --
classic micro-aggression.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.210
Micro-aggression?
Yeah.

16:59.210 --> 17:03.500
Well, in my day, we had
aggression aggressions.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.670
So don't talk to me until
you've been called the n-word

17:06.670 --> 17:09.960
while walking out of the
hospital with your newborn baby.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.960
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry that happened.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.880
I didn't know that.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.170
Mm-hmm.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.790
But what I'm talking about
is different, Ruby.

17:18.790 --> 17:22.670
I-I accomplished
something huge today,

17:22.670 --> 17:24.420
and now every time
I look at this thing,

17:24.420 --> 17:27.120
I'm gonna think
of what she said to me.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.170
It's ruined.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.040
So what are you gonna
do about it?

17:31.040 --> 17:32.500
What can I do about it?

17:32.500 --> 17:35.750
Well, I handed baby Dre
to the security guard

17:35.750 --> 17:38.290
and chased that truck down!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.330
Well, that makes sense.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.210
That kind of racism's
so in-your-face.

17:41.210 --> 17:42.330
I mean,
who could deny it?

17:42.330 --> 17:44.250
But what I'm talking about
is more subtle.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.920
It's when you feel it
in your gut,

17:45.920 --> 17:47.000
but no one backs you up.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.710
Oh, I get it.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.580
Like with Obama.

17:50.580 --> 17:54.540
Everyone said
he was so well-spoken.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.960
But we all knew
what they meant by that.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.170
Yeah, we did.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.460
It didn't
take away the fact

18:00.460 --> 18:04.420
that he was president
for eight years.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.710
And you...

18:06.710 --> 18:09.920
shouldn't let them
take away your joy.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.330
Thank you, Ruby.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.210
What'd you do
when you caught that truck?

18:15.210 --> 18:17.330
Oh, he got away.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.460
You know, when I got back,
I'm not even sure

18:19.460 --> 18:21.880
if the security guard
gave me back the same baby.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.330
What?

18:23.330 --> 18:24.710
But it was the '70s.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.880
You know, I'm from
a different time.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.120
Yeah.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.330
Dre is definitely
your baby.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.330
There's no question there.

18:36.420 --> 18:40.080
So when they went out
into the backyard...

18:40.080 --> 18:41.580
they found --

18:41.580 --> 18:46.170
A young-looking dad
in the swaggiest of jeans

18:46.170 --> 18:48.290
who thought...

18:48.290 --> 18:49.880
he knew his kids.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.080
Oh, no. He's back.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.040
Who is watching the gate?

18:53.040 --> 18:54.380
This is not a safe place!

18:54.380 --> 18:55.750
Excuse me, sir.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.080
Only the person with the
flashlight is supposed to talk.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.420
These are the rules
of the fire.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.960
Where'd he get
that phone?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.960
Anyway...

19:06.960 --> 19:10.880
this swaggy dad thought his kids
would be just like him.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.500
But they weren't.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.620
They loved unlikable things

19:14.620 --> 19:19.710
like whittling
and bird watching and wizards.

19:19.710 --> 19:23.380
So the dad realized
that instead of hating

19:23.380 --> 19:25.790
on all the new things
that they loved,

19:25.790 --> 19:29.750
he would try --
I mean, really try --

19:29.750 --> 19:34.290
to enjoy those things with them
while he still can.

19:34.290 --> 19:38.330
Because he didn't want
that door to close on him.

19:38.330 --> 19:39.290
It was a window.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.710
It -- It doesn't matter.
Door's good, too.

19:42.710 --> 19:45.290
Anyway,
I'm gonna do better.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.920
Will you guys
forgive me?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.830
-Okay, fine.
-Bring it in, Dad.

19:53.830 --> 19:56.170
Ohh, guys, I love you!

19:56.170 --> 19:57.540
Janine:
That was sweet.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.290
Think I can
get a hug, too?

19:59.290 --> 20:00.830
I hate you.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.290
Thank you
for saying that quietly.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.460
Actually, he didn't.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.790
So, I came around
to some parts of camping.

20:10.790 --> 20:11.880
Like s'mores.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.670
Whoa!

20:13.670 --> 20:16.380
And sing-alongs,
once I could pick the songs.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.330
♪ If I didn't ride blade
on curbs, would you still... ♪

20:18.330 --> 20:19.960
♪ Love me ♪

20:19.960 --> 20:22.080

20:25.710 --> 20:26.670

20:26.670 --> 20:27.750
Can I do
the Kendrick part now?

20:27.750 --> 20:29.580
Janine! Sit down!

20:36.920 --> 20:38.210
Oh. Hi.

20:38.210 --> 20:39.620
I've been thinking
about what you said,

20:39.620 --> 20:41.000
and you were right.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.210
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize

20:42.210 --> 20:44.290
what Dr. Cole
was doing yesterday.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.710
Did you...come to
that conclusion on your own?

20:46.710 --> 20:49.920
Well, uh, she was
loud-talking at Dr. Chen

20:49.920 --> 20:51.670
because she didn't think
she spoke English.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.000
What?!
Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.620
Dr. Chen is
from Bakersfield.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.540
Mm-hmm.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.620
Ew.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.420
So my eyes are open now.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.580
Thank you.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.620
You're welcome.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.830
And honestly,

21:01.830 --> 21:03.540
it feels really nice to be

21:03.540 --> 21:05.670
seen and heard, so thank you.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.330
Mm-hmm. Good.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.540
And listen, if I ever do
one of these micro-aggressions,

21:09.540 --> 21:10.750
will you please
let me know?

21:10.750 --> 21:12.000
Actually, there's, uh --

21:12.000 --> 21:13.790
there's a gender one.

21:13.790 --> 21:16.250
Um, you have a tendency
to interrupt --

21:16.250 --> 21:17.580
Let me stop you there.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.380
I think if I did
one of these micro-aggressions,

21:19.380 --> 21:20.250
I would know it.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.540
Okay. 'Cause...
