03:08.340 --> 03:15.400
I was fixing food for the kids
and we all heard a scream.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.920
I ran to the bathroom
to check on her.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.940
And I opened the door and,

03:25.840 --> 03:28.080
and she was all full of blood.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.120
She took her own life.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.900
She turns 18 tomorrow

03:39.400 --> 03:40.740
and I believe

03:41.320 --> 03:43.100
that is why she did it.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.840
Because we are a family here

03:46.660 --> 03:48.420
we all love each other

03:49.120 --> 03:50.280
and she didn't want to leave.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.440
She didn't want to leave.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.960
I think I have
everything I need.

04:00.700 --> 04:01.720
We'll be in touch.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.599

05:42.120 --> 05:43.120
Well...

05:45.260 --> 05:47.240
I guess your old enough to know.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.740
She took her own life.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.740
She...

05:54.860 --> 05:57.820
Slit her wrists... wide open.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.020
I don't believe it.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.900
She would never do that, She was the
strongest one out of all of us.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.720
I know.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.640
I don't know what happened...
um.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.380
I guess she just wasn't
ready to be released.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.960
She turns 18 tomorrow

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740

06:20.720 --> 06:22.340

Your brothers and i are
here for you Julz.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.880
Give us a sign.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.400
Nope, Nope, nope, nope.

45:41.800 --> 45:42.860
Fuck I just Fucked up.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.616
I wasn't supposed to
blow out the candle.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.279
What do you mean you were not supposed to
blow out the candle what does that mean

45:48.280 --> 45:48.880
I panicked

45:49.240 --> 45:50.040
Jesus Mikey.

45:50.060 --> 45:51.700
Okay, But what does that mean

45:51.900 --> 45:52.900
I have no idea.

45:53.180 --> 45:55.260
Alright this is the first
time I blow out the candle.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.578
You said you fucked up,
what does that mean,

45:57.590 --> 45:59.240
your supposed to know
what that means.

46:00.220 --> 46:03.040
It means that Julz is here.

46:03.320 --> 46:06.520
If anything then we
trapped Julz here.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.140
Yea because if you blow out the
candle you trap the spirit...

46:10.900 --> 46:11.900
Here.

46:12.260 --> 46:13.779
Good fucking job Mikey.

46:13.780 --> 46:16.200
The whole point was to contact
Julz not trap him here.

46:18.180 --> 46:21.619
I think the best bet is we just investigate
the house and leave as soon as we can.

46:21.620 --> 46:24.300
Yea, thats a good idea we
need to leave here asap.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.540
