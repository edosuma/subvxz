00:03.404 --> 00:04.372
Oh, there you are.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.406
These are all wrong.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.508
You're probably thinking
of your future nursery,

00:07.541 --> 00:09.043
not my dining room.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.078
- So Brittany's mom
is in town.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.246
- It's definitely different
from where I live.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.814
- No sex, no drinking.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.183
Definitely can't poop
with the door open.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.618
- Did y'all ever
get into a church?

00:17.651 --> 00:18.619
- A what?

00:18.652 --> 00:20.521
- I think it's best for me

00:20.554 --> 00:22.290
to walk away
from this workplace.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.258
- F---ing give up?
What's wrong with you?

00:24.292 --> 00:26.127
If you quit,
you're gonna give some people

00:26.160 --> 00:27.228
a lot of satisfaction,

00:27.261 --> 00:29.063
and I don't think
you wanna do that.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.065
- I think it's kinda
f---ed up what Lala's done,

00:31.099 --> 00:33.834
because I've heard there's
other people affected by this.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.803
- What about the guy?
- I'm sorry, what?

00:35.836 --> 00:37.805
- You saying that
is defending her right there.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.607
- That is so beyond
delusional.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.841
- It's my f---ing
bridal shower.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.875
I don't need to be upset
about it.

- Good.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.327

- Everything's okay in...

01:33.361 --> 01:35.263

another story, you know?

01:42.336 --> 01:44.238
Last night, I get a bunch
of angry texts from Kristen

01:44.272 --> 01:45.906
and I'm like, "I'm not
fighting with you over text."

01:45.939 --> 01:47.608
- About what?
- When we were talking about

01:47.641 --> 01:49.643
the bridal shower and stuff,
Katie's like,

01:49.677 --> 01:51.645
"I don't want you guys
spending a lot of money."

01:51.679 --> 01:54.215
So then when it starts
costing a few thousand dollars--

01:54.248 --> 01:56.584
- How come it cost so much?
- Because we had to pay $1,500

01:56.617 --> 01:58.419
to borrow the house,
and Kristen thought

01:58.452 --> 02:01.222
that her, Stassi, and I
would just split it three ways.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.623
I'm like,
I didn't agree to this.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.293
It'd be one thing
if I was actually

02:05.326 --> 02:07.895
included in the planning process
of the bridal shower,

02:07.928 --> 02:09.697
but Stassi and Kristen
are just deciding

02:09.730 --> 02:11.365
how my money's being spent

02:11.399 --> 02:13.367
without discussing it
with me first.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.635
- Sit down for a second.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.604
I don't think it needs
to come back to Katie.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.472
Do you think that she wants
to have the memory

02:18.506 --> 02:20.341
of her bridal shower
that her bridesmaids

02:20.374 --> 02:21.642
were quibbling
over the price?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.644
Have your opinions,
but you can't--

02:23.677 --> 02:25.546
not invest in it so much.
- Yeah.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.349
- Now, your shift's
going to be starting very soon.

[laughs] to go to your birthday

02:56.777 --> 02:58.412
It's all coming together.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.282
I didn't totally blast it
all over social media,

03:01.315 --> 03:02.350
because I wasn't sure

03:02.383 --> 03:05.219
what the capacity
was gonna be like for Busby's...

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
- Yeah.

raise money.

- Do you need the bathroom?
- Yes.

For my birthday,
I'm not just having a rager.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.727
I'm doing a "fun-rager."

03:15.028 --> 03:16.697
Oh, yeah.
Gotta get that glow.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.732
So I've teamed up with
Richardson,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.634
Lisa's head server
over at Pump

03:20.668 --> 03:23.371
to raise money
for Project Elev8.

They provide education

So my braid guy's comin' over.

Hey, what's up, dude?
How you doing?

03:31.011 --> 03:32.546

Good.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.581
- Tom has a braid guy.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.715
I have several people

03:34.748 --> 03:36.784
to braid my hair.
Hi.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.652
You know I'm so jealous
of you right now.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.588
You know I'm braid obsessed.
- I know you are.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.655
- Braid-sessed.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.890
Think of all the money
we would save

03:42.923 --> 03:46.327
if Tom and I could just learn
to braid each other's hair.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.596
- So Jax's roast
is coming up.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.763
- I am way behind on that.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.599
I haven't even
started on that.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.301
All I've been thinking about
is this fundraiser.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.303
- I gotta really
hit him deep.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.538
Tonight kicks off
a whole week of debauchery,

03:57.571 --> 04:02.343
because after my birthday
we have Jax's birthday roast.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.378
I think it's funny
that Kristen's throwing it.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.646
- She's gonna be
the f---ing punch line.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.847
- That's what I'm saying.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.750
Why would she put herself
in that position?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.653
It's actually brave of Kristen
to wanna host this roast

04:12.686 --> 04:14.488
where everyone's
gonna talk about

04:14.522 --> 04:16.624
all the horrible things
that Jax has done.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.292
Half the horrible things
that he's done

04:18.326 --> 04:19.693
have been with Kristen.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.762
- Kristen texted me
happy birthday today.

04:21.795 --> 04:26.367
So I invited her.
I invited Stassi.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.435
- Yeah.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.869
I'm not trying to be involved

04:28.902 --> 04:31.339
in, like a group of friends--

04:31.372 --> 04:32.373
- Then I don't understand
what you're doing.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.507
- Because I care about Katie.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.675
I don't give a f--- about you.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.609
- That's so rude.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.778
- The more people,
the more money we get.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.413
- Yeah.
- That's my philosophy.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.650
If Stassi comes or doesn't
is really up to her,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.686
but, honestly, if you don't
show up to a charity event,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.755

sh----er than I thought.

dirty pink.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.856
I have to go back
to the paint store

05:22.890 --> 05:25.426
because Lisa hated
all the paint samples

05:25.459 --> 05:27.094
I brought her for the VIP room.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.596
Like, I don't know
if that exists.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.797
Like,
what is a dirty pink?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.432
- Look at all these pinks.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.401
Look how subtle
the difference is.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.635
It's like my hair every day--

05:34.668 --> 05:35.703
it's just subtly different,
you know?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.805

You're not listening.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.673

- Dusty. Like, look at that.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.548
Paint shopping's
not that fun.

Oh, Jesus.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.853
- Sh--.
- Have you looked in the mirror?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.855
Your eyes look like Jax's eyes.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.856
- We didn't even
drink that much.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.493
[laughter, chatter]

06:01.695 --> 06:03.597
I think our server
roofied us last night.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.698
- I had plenty to drink
earlier on,

06:04.732 --> 06:05.799
but then I stopped drinking.

why you were so fired up then.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.708
- It was my bridal shower...

06:14.742 --> 06:15.876
- The whole thing's so amazing,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.144
then we're sitting here
talking about Lala.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.812

come on.

In light of everything--you're
surrounded by your friends

06:20.914 --> 06:22.883

- No, Tom, I was upset

06:22.916 --> 06:24.818
'cause I wanted you
to help me when we got home.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.421
- Okay, but you don't have
to start a huge fight over it.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.790
- After my bridal shower,
I was coming home

06:29.823 --> 06:31.859
with a bunch of gifts,
and I asked Tom

06:31.892 --> 06:34.628
if he would help us carry
everything up from the car.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.597
And he didn't want to.
He wanted to go out to the bars

06:36.630 --> 06:38.632
with his friends.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.201
I text Tom
with some choice words.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.705
It turned into this
text fight conversation.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.441
He just wanted
to be having a good time,

06:47.475 --> 06:48.609
and I was ruining it.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.943
- You started a fight
over nothing,

06:49.977 --> 06:51.579
just like you usually do.
- No, I didn't.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.913
- You never take any
accountability for your actions.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.783
- Tom, you don't either!
- Yes, I do, 100%.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.718

f---ing sh---faced last night.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.920
- So were you.
- No, I was not!

06:59.953 --> 07:01.221
- The only time
you act like that

07:01.254 --> 07:02.656
is when you've been
drinking a lot.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.857
You're passive-aggressive.
- No, I wasn't--

07:03.891 --> 07:05.659
- You're short, you're mean.
- No!

07:05.693 --> 07:07.861
- And way outta line.
Can you say that as well?

07:07.895 --> 07:09.630
- No, I wasn't out of line!
- Yeah, okay.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.698
- I'm sorry, I didn't
come home and say,

07:10.731 --> 07:12.800
"F---ing alcoholic, drunk!"
the minute I walked in,

07:12.833 --> 07:15.202
like you did to me.
- I was pissed. Yeah.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.838
- But what I did
did not warrant that response.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.673

07:19.707 --> 07:21.475
Oh, my God,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.564
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

08:16.597 --> 08:17.665
What's up, man?
- How are you?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.733
- Aah! Muah. Good to see you.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.868
- I like your outfit.
- Oh-ho!

08:20.901 --> 08:23.904
Look at this guy!
Happy birthday!

08:25.038 --> 08:26.740
- Birthday suit
I see over there.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.875
- Hey!
- Hi!

08:27.908 --> 08:29.076
- How's it goin', man?
- Oh, hey.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.745
I didn't even see you.
- Happy birthday.

08:31.779 --> 08:32.780
- * To the bar we go

08:32.813 --> 08:35.549
- Oh, my God!
What's up?

08:35.583 --> 08:37.618
- Did you guys donate?
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna go.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.786
- So I feel good about
myself.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.821
On days I'm being
a selfish bitch...

08:40.854 --> 08:41.722
- Yeah.
- That I'm like,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.757
"You know what,
I did this yesterday."

08:43.791 --> 08:44.792
- You excited for
your first night?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.293
- Yeah, man, your first--
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.628
But it should be good,

08:47.661 --> 08:48.662
it should be fun.
- Dude.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.831
- I came to Arthur,
the last manager at Pump,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.033
asking for a job
'cause I need to pay my bills.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.935
You guys need a DJ
at Redbury?

08:54.968 --> 08:57.070
- If you're gonna DJ for us,
you're not drinking.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.839
- 100%.
- And the minute

08:58.872 --> 09:01.875
you break your word, I gotta cut
your hair or something.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.043
- Well, happy birthday, dude.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.912
- Thanks, man.
Thanks for coming, man.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
- Hi!

09:06.647 --> 09:08.348
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.317
Your body's amazing.
- Thank you!

09:10.350 --> 09:12.853
- Oh, hey, man, what's up?
[laughing]

09:12.886 --> 09:15.055
- Wonder how old Tom is today,
maybe like 34?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.857
- I don't know.
- He'd kill me if I said that.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.158
I think he's 33.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.793
But he may be 34.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.995
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.597
- I wanna make
a donation.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.332
It's kinda f---ed up,
but me and Katie,

09:25.365 --> 09:26.900
we've been in so many fights,

09:26.934 --> 09:28.602
I can call her a bitch
and then,

09:28.636 --> 09:30.871
six, seven hours later,
we'll be at a party,

09:30.904 --> 09:31.905
happy, in love.

09:31.939 --> 09:32.940
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

09:32.973 --> 09:34.341
Thanks for coming, guys.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.776
- So relatively speaking,

09:35.809 --> 09:37.645
me calling her a bitch
and her storming out,

09:37.678 --> 09:39.613
that's just Casual Thursdays.

09:39.647 --> 09:40.881
- I'm bringing
double-breasted back.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.050
- That's more 'NSYNC--
'NSYNC Michael Jackson.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.785
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, I could see that.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.986
All right, let's--
- Hey!

09:46.019 --> 09:47.688
Whoa! Hey!

09:47.721 --> 09:49.890
[laughing]
Hey!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.825
- All right,
let's get a drink.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.927
- I watch football here
every Sunday.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.697
- This is your spot.
- It's like a little sports bar.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.198
It's cool, though.
All right!

09:58.231 --> 09:59.967
- Well, hello, party people.
- Hi!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.401
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.936
- Oh, my God,
you're beautiful!

10:02.970 --> 10:03.871
Lookit--There he is!
What's up, big man?

10:03.904 --> 10:06.073
- How you doing, man?
- Good seeing you.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.374
- Hello, doll.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.842
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi!

10:08.876 --> 10:10.644
- How are you?
- I'm glad to see

10:10.678 --> 10:11.444
you guys
are still together.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.847
- Yes. Thank God.
- Considering...

10:13.881 --> 10:14.982
- Considering what?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.918
- Oh. You don't know?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.155
- He ended up
calling me a bitch.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.224
I got in my car
and said, "Call an Uber."

10:30.798 --> 10:31.799
- * When you're born
to somethin' *

10:34.367 --> 10:37.137
* This'll be a bumpy ride...

10:37.170 --> 10:38.839
- Thanks for comin', man.
- Hey, happy birthday.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.307
- Yeah, thanks, man.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.809
- Look at you
in your all white!

10:41.842 --> 10:43.243
Happy birthday!

10:43.276 --> 10:45.278
- I'm glad to see
you guys are still together.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.447
- Yes. Thank God.
- Considering...

10:47.480 --> 10:50.250
- Considering what?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.384
- Oh. You don't know?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.453
About Ellie?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.355
- Oh, I've told her
everything.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.158
- I need to stand up
for my friend Ellie.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.794
We've been friends
for seven, eight years now.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.163
We both opened up
Villa Blanca together,

11:03.196 --> 11:04.431
and that's how
we became friends.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.700
I don't appreciate
that he's going around L.A.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.168
telling everyone she's a liar.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.236
Ellie said she had
a picture of you

11:09.269 --> 11:11.204
in bed with her in March.
- Which she took back,

11:11.238 --> 11:12.773
'cause she's a DJ groupie.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.441
- March...

11:14.474 --> 11:17.778
8:44 a.m.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.280
- They take selfies
of other people's butts.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.849
Like, that's just...

11:21.882 --> 11:23.316
- Kudos to James.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.753
He found the one
beautiful, dumb as f--- girl

11:25.786 --> 11:27.187
to believe all of his lies

11:27.220 --> 11:29.823
while he just goes around L.A.
and just sleeps with girls.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.391
'Cause, I mean,
how are you just that dumb?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.762
All right, well, glad
to see you guys are doing well.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.196
- Hope you have a good night.
- Thank you.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.865
- I've gotta go
do my residency.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.266
- Fun.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.868
- Hey, hi!

11:40.901 --> 11:42.202
- How are you?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.337
We're doing donations,
just to let you know.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.339
- I'll donate, uh,
$500.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.175
- Thank you so much!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.077
- Is that enough?
- Uh, that's more than enough!

11:50.110 --> 11:52.179
- Hi, Lisa!
- Hey, guys.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.413
[laughter, chatter]

11:53.446 --> 11:56.884
I'm buying you
a fifth-grader's education.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.218
- That was a complete...
- Holy f---!

11:58.251 --> 11:59.386
- Waste of time.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.420
- Why?
- Because, "Oh, she already

12:00.453 --> 12:02.455
knows about that."
I was like, "But you're okay

12:02.489 --> 12:04.091
with all of this?"
And she was like,

12:04.124 --> 12:05.325
"I already knew everything."

12:05.358 --> 12:07.861
Like, she's a really pretty
girl, but she's dumb as f---.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.296
- Dumb as f---.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.264
- All right, Thomas,
I gotta fly to Redbury.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.933
- Bye. Oh, my God.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.501
Good luck!
- I had so much fun. Thanks!

12:14.534 --> 12:15.903
- I did want to talk to you

12:15.936 --> 12:17.370
about all the texts
you sent me last night.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.806
- I was pissed.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.340
- But that's the thing,
Kristen,

12:20.373 --> 12:23.510
is you guys can't make plans
without me

12:23.543 --> 12:25.245
and expect me
to just be onboard.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.546
- You were actually
included in this decision.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.349
- I didn't agree
to split $1,500 three ways.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.418
If we all split it eight ways,
that's a lot less.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.253
That's half a shift.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.522
You're making me feel like
I'm not "as good of a "friend"

12:35.555 --> 12:37.390
or "as good of a bridesmaid"...
- No--

12:37.424 --> 12:39.426
- Because I didn't spend...
- You're making yourself

12:39.459 --> 12:41.561
feel that way.
- I hate fighting about money.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.296
It makes me feel so weird.
- No, and me too.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.199
I don't ever like sounding
like the cheap friend.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.435
- I spent, pers--

12:50.603 --> 12:53.140
Hi!

12:53.173 --> 12:55.242
- This sh-- right here
needs to stay right here.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.576
Scheana needs to
shut her mouth.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
You wanna make the bride
feel guilty

12:58.411 --> 13:00.247
about us throwing
a party for her?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.514
- You guys,
today was so amazing.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.316
It was so much fun.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.853
- I'm so glad.
- Thank you all so much!

13:05.886 --> 13:07.888
- I am a people pleaser.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.289
That's no secret.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.291
But I've noticed,
since becoming closer friends

13:11.324 --> 13:13.160
with Kristen,
Katie, and Stassi,

13:13.193 --> 13:15.228
I've literally lost my voice.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.564
- It was such a chic
bridal shower outfit, like--

13:17.597 --> 13:20.300
- It was chic as f---.
- I just don't know

13:20.333 --> 13:21.334
how much more I can take.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.270
- Whatever
you'd like to donate...

13:23.303 --> 13:25.605
- So whatever your balance
in your bank account is...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.474
[laughter]
Write that down right here,

13:27.507 --> 13:29.376
and then click submit.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.911
- Ariana will swipe
and do all of that.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.379
I won't look.
- It's from both of us.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.381
- Okay, cool.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.250
Oh, my God, Jax,
your card is declined.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.386
- That's--can't be right.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.253
[laughter]

13:40.287 --> 13:41.855
- You know, I've heard
that one before.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.490
I'm not gonna lie!
[laughing]

13:43.523 --> 13:44.958
- Why does sh-- like this
always happen

13:44.992 --> 13:46.326
when my girlfriend's mom
is in town?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
Why does it never happen
when I'm out to lunch

13:48.395 --> 13:50.363
goin' to McDonald's?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.899
- Let's try hers.
- Oh, groovy.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.933
- Oh...ah!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.602
- I actually work at Sur
more than you do, okay?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.337
- Approved.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.471
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.273
- I'm sorry, but your card
got declined,

14:00.307 --> 14:01.274
and mine went through.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.876
Now make me a sandwich.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.978
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you, dude.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.348
- Will you help me sing
"Happy Birthday"?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.951
all: * Happy birthday

14:10.984 --> 14:13.353
* To you

14:13.386 --> 14:16.489
[all whooping]

14:16.523 --> 14:17.324
- Thank you, guys.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.525
I really appreciate
you all coming.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.527
- And if you like donuts,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.062
then have a donut!

14:22.095 --> 14:23.363
- I'm so sorry for this, but--
- Oh--

14:23.396 --> 14:26.266
- Oh! Jager bombs!
- Jager bombs.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.600
- So I have to drink
this whole thing in one gulp?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.402
- I mean,
you can take a break.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.971
We're not bullies.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.305
- I'm terrified.
- I love you guys.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.573
- All right, cheers.
- Cheers!

14:35.575 --> 14:38.645
[light music]

14:38.678 --> 14:41.414
*

14:41.448 --> 14:43.083
- I just chugged it
like a beer.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.684
Oh, my God.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.387
It's making me have T-H-O.
- What is T-H-O?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.089
- Titty hard-on!

14:49.122 --> 14:50.924
- Thanks, darling.
- Vodka soda.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.292
- Has anybody seen Lala?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.494
- I sent her an invitation
for tonight.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.396
But I didn't know
she was outta town.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.630
- Lala's just fallen off
the face of the earth.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.300
- I have not heard from her.
- I mean, she hasn't shown up

15:00.333 --> 15:02.302
for her shifts,
she hasn't called in.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.404
But I mean, still,
at least have some respect

15:04.437 --> 15:05.973
when the person's
employing you.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.276
Lala, once again, is MIA.
I'm disappointed.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.544
Who knows what she's doing
and what she's up to?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.413
How are you getting on
with Stassi?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.282
- I don't like her very much.
- You don't?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.684
- She likes to try to tell
people how to live their lives

15:17.717 --> 15:19.019
and how they should be.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.120
- Well, she's an expect.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.354
- Oh, apparently.
- She is.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.323
- Stassi's idea

15:23.356 --> 15:25.993
that I'm gonna be another one
of her little f---in' puppets

15:26.026 --> 15:27.394
is ridiculous.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.696
She is not about to
boss me around

15:29.729 --> 15:31.398
like she does with
her other friends.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.666
- Stassi wants to rule
the world, yeah.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.535
- She does.
And she's not gonna rule me.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.438
- How's that cami fitting ya?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.140
- I was tired
of wearing that harness.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.442
- Oh, Jax, I had a bra
just like that

15:42.475 --> 15:44.444
when I was ten.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.478
- Will you please show Mom?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.080
Please show Mom your shirt.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.582
- There's a cami.
- Oh, my gosh!

15:49.616 --> 15:50.917
[laughter]

15:50.950 --> 15:54.054
- I never thought that I would
be lending Jax clothes,

15:54.087 --> 15:56.089
and I also never thought
I would have a boyfriend

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
whose had more boob jobs
than me.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.993
- I'm not gonna lie.
It is comfortable.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.461
- Do I have my samples?
Have you got the--

16:01.494 --> 16:02.629
- They're in my car.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.997
- I need them
in the restaurant.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.198
- Well, I-I brought Tom to be

16:05.232 --> 16:08.601
like my other eyes, 'cause
his eyes are better than mine.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.038
- I don't have that much
confidence

16:11.071 --> 16:13.673
in Tom choosing the color
of my VIP room.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.076
- Well, you wouldn't have
many compliments

16:16.109 --> 16:18.111
after the way he acted
at the paint store,

16:18.145 --> 16:20.447
because he ended up
calling me a bitch.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.781
I got in my car and said,

16:21.814 --> 16:23.450
"If I'm a bitch,
then I'm gonna be one.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.584
Call an Uber."

16:24.617 --> 16:26.653
- You're getting married
in a few weeks, for God's sake.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.421
You gotta start working
this stuff out.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.423
- Oh, he was able
to redeem himself.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.125
I drove a block
and he called me and he's like,

16:32.159 --> 16:32.959
"No, I went to the Dark Side.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.461
It was me, it was me,
it was me."

16:34.494 --> 16:36.063
I was like, "That's right."

16:36.096 --> 16:38.098
- Can I steal you for a second?
- Can I grab my drink?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.466
- Yeah.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.168
- Here he comes.
I'll rip him a new one.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.136
- Yeah.
- Mr. Schwartz!

16:43.170 --> 16:44.771
- It's good to see you.
- Yes?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.040
Have you been
behaving yourself?

16:47.074 --> 16:49.076
- Yeah.
- No.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.678
- Guys, seriously, it's time
to sort this nonsense out.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.047
You can't go through life
fighting over nothing.

16:54.081 --> 16:57.517
- I got a little outta
line, she got a--Well...

16:57.550 --> 16:59.452
- No.
- Bye. I will see you later.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.687
- We have so much
to catch up on.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.790
- We're well and truly
caught up.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.792
- I'm so glad we did this.
- Yeah.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.194
There are just
a couple things

17:07.227 --> 17:08.828
I feel like I've been,
like, crying

17:08.861 --> 17:11.231
on and off all day.
- Really? Why?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.165
- I don't look like it?
- No.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.533
- That's awesome.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.136
I've been feeling like

17:16.169 --> 17:17.837
really lonely lately
because

17:17.870 --> 17:21.141
everything with Shay and I
is so good.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.410
But he's not around
as much.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.146
Last night, I got home,
and he's not here.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.181
And then I'm texting him
and I'm texting him,

17:28.215 --> 17:30.250
and he's not responding
and I'm like, "Hey,

17:30.283 --> 17:32.252
"it's 3:00 a.m., like,
I'm just checking.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.686
You okay?
You still at the studio?"

17:33.720 --> 17:36.456
And finally he's like,
"Babe, I'm trying to record,

17:36.489 --> 17:38.258
"and you are bothering me
right now.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.227
I'm trying to do a job."

17:40.260 --> 17:42.129
It scares me.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.698
And I feel I can't talk
to the other girls about this,

17:45.732 --> 17:47.467
because then the next time
they get drunk,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.068
they'll throw it in my face.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.773
- Well, I'm just gonna say
that, like,

17:53.806 --> 17:56.509
you, Kristen, and Katie,
you guys get drunk all the time,

17:56.543 --> 17:57.877
and you fight.
- Have you talked to her

17:57.910 --> 17:59.446
about this?
- No! 'Cause we can never

17:59.479 --> 18:00.347
talk to Scheana about anything.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.881
- Let's just talk about
Katie's wedding,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.450
'cause that's the only
f---ing thing

18:03.483 --> 18:04.717
you guys like talking about
right now.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.587
Like I feel like I can't have
anything going on in my own life

18:07.620 --> 18:08.921
because this summer's
all about Katie.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.491
Katie's wedding, Katie's bridal
shower, Katie's bachelor party.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.160
Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie,
Katie.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.295
I feel like I've just
become a yes girl

18:15.328 --> 18:16.829
who's like,
"Yes. Oh, love that.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.131
Oh, my God, totally."

18:18.165 --> 18:20.300
- It's easy to do that.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.469
Especially--I know you are
that person

18:22.502 --> 18:24.871
that wants everybody
to get along.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.839
And if people
don't love you,

18:26.873 --> 18:28.708
then they're not
your real friends.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.310
- Here's to not being afraid

18:30.343 --> 18:32.212
of the truth.
- That's why I'm so happy

18:32.245 --> 18:35.282
that we're all in, like,
the best friendship spot ever.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.884
- You're not crazy.
- I love you so much.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.556
- Hey, everybody.
Can I get everybody over here?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.225
All right, guys,

18:45.258 --> 18:48.795
we had a goal tonight
to raise $5,000.

18:48.828 --> 18:53.333
We raised $8,604

18:53.366 --> 18:55.302
because of you guys!

18:55.335 --> 18:57.637
Whoo!
Going to Project Elev8!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.639

so hard to clean up!

18:59.672 --> 19:01.208
[overlapping chatter]

19:01.241 --> 19:03.343
- That's $8,600
going to kids in Haiti.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.778
And that feels good.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.181
It's gonna help me get through
my hangover tomorrow.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.549
- Hey, you're cleaning
that up!

19:11.384 --> 19:12.919
- We all have a little past.

19:12.952 --> 19:16.256
Mine is just a lot...
worse than some people's.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.857
I mean,
I didn't kill anybody.

19:23.363 --> 19:23.963
- * Hey now, hey now

19:24.997 --> 19:26.566
* Ain't nobody
gonna tell me how *

19:26.599 --> 19:30.270
* I go my own way...

19:30.303 --> 19:32.539
- Here we are.
- Thanks, baby.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.407
*

19:34.441 --> 19:35.975
What do you have to do
to set up?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.477
- So I just...

19:37.510 --> 19:39.412
press this button.
- Turn it on.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.648
[dance music plays]
That's way too complicated

19:41.681 --> 19:43.650
for me.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.385
It sounds so good.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.422
- Whoo! Today is the day,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.258
that I start my residency.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.293
I'm here at the Redbury Hotel

19:53.326 --> 19:54.694
where we're doing everything
but drinking.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.431
- Hey.
- Hey!

19:58.465 --> 20:00.367
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.701
[overlapping greetings]

20:01.734 --> 20:03.570
- I just went to Tom's party.
You didn't make it?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.571
- Oh, I didn't know about it.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.440
- Oh. Tom had a little
fundraiser thing tonight.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.675
You missed
a hell of a party.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.543
I'm just kidding.
You didn't miss much, dude.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.546
Apart from Scheana coming up
and trying to stir a little pot.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.416
She comes up and goes,
"Oh, hi, you must be Raquel,"

20:16.449 --> 20:18.385
like, "Good to see you guys
are still together."

your own f---ing marriage

20:20.620 --> 20:22.322

three times.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.756
- That's a bit harsh,
isn't it?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.458
- Bit harsh? No.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.394
That's that.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.697
And, um...
this is my new Pump.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.732
People
really underestimate me.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.402
How many bus boys
have come in and out of Sur,

20:35.435 --> 20:36.769
and how many have prevailed?

20:36.803 --> 20:38.371
Just one, my friend.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.673
The ultimate infiltration.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.442
Is that a word?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.643
'Cause I just made it one.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.345
- What do you think?
- I love it.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.713
I love the space.
- No Pump.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.415
It's a little different.
- I like it, though.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.782
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.618
- Yeah, man. I'm glad that
we get to work together again.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.020
- Me, too.
- Let's do it.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.588
Let me know if you need
anything, okay?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.457
- All right,
thanks, mate.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.658
I could do with
a dirty martini.

Anything else
I can get for you?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.775
- You wanna take a look
at a cocktail menu

21:15.808 --> 21:17.410

How's everything?
- It's been hectic.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.654
- And we're still
a hostess down...

21:27.687 --> 21:30.490
- A hostess short, yeah.
- Yeah, Lala.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.791
You know what really
pissed me off

21:31.824 --> 21:33.526
is you give somebody
so many chances,

21:33.560 --> 21:36.329
you invest in them,
and they screw you over.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.296
I can only do so much.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.599
I offered Lala a job
when she was in trouble.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.834
I've stuck with her.
I've supported her.

from Pump, no problem.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.810
after your fight
the other night?

- Good. I mean, it was like
so blown out of proportion.

like, been drinking margaritas

21:55.948 --> 21:57.684

- That's what I was gonna say,

I feel like you guys
fight only when you drink.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.123

not just him.

- Like...

the last few times

22:09.796 --> 22:11.831

Katie's drinking..."

sometimes too.

Oh, also, the last
two nights in a row,

22:17.970 --> 22:20.707
I've gotten angry, drunk
text messages from Kristen.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.409
Has she said anything
to you?

22:22.442 --> 22:23.710
- The last two nights?
- After the shower,

22:23.743 --> 22:25.512
she text me immediately
and goes,

22:25.545 --> 22:28.448
"So we're splitting this
three ways, right?"

22:28.481 --> 22:30.450
- Isn't it Etiquette 101

22:30.483 --> 22:31.451
that you don't tell someone

22:31.484 --> 22:33.720
what you spent on their party
or their gifts?

22:33.753 --> 22:34.854
- I was just thinking why?

22:34.887 --> 22:37.924
You're spending thousands
on a shower for a few hours.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.460
- I feel it's very tacky,

22:40.493 --> 22:41.961

that the bridesmaids

22:41.994 --> 22:44.564

amongst themselves

22:44.597 --> 22:45.732
without me being involved.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.799
- She went off on me
for that.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.735
And then I get another
angry, drunk text from her

22:48.768 --> 22:50.703
about Ariana.
Last night, Ariana and I

22:50.737 --> 22:52.539

a heart-to-heart.

a special interest in that.

last night,

we're back,

doesn't like that,

23:16.796 --> 23:18.698
- Jax's birthday today!
- Oh, awesome, happy birthday.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.732
- Thank you.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.200
- I will send
your server right up.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.202
- Let's hope my credit card
works this time.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.504
- Oh, my gosh!

23:24.537 --> 23:25.404
- How's it going?
- Hi, how are you?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.939
both: Hi!
- So, welcome to The Guild.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.207
Any entrees for now?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.210
- I wanna do the rib-eye,
medium-rare.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.912
- And for you?
- Same thing, medium-rare.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.814
- I'm gonna do that,
but can I do it medium?

23:34.847 --> 23:36.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.817
- Oh, my God, this life

23:37.850 --> 23:39.686
is so different
from Kentucky.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.588
I mean, I haven't stopped
since I've been here.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.922
I mean, I usually go to work,

23:42.955 --> 23:44.924
go out and feed the horses...
- Are you tired?

23:44.957 --> 23:46.459
- And go to bed.
Yeah, I'm a little tired.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.528
- So tomorrow,
about this roast situation.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.663
We all have a little past.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.666
Mine is just a lot...
worse than some people's.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.535
For my birthday roast,
I just really wanna

23:55.568 --> 23:56.836
prepare Brittany's mom
a little bit

23:56.869 --> 23:58.605
of some things she might hear

23:58.638 --> 24:00.507
and some things
she's definitely gonna hear.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.708
I mean,
I didn't kill anybody.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.742
That's pretty much
the only thing I didn't do.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.910
- Oh, my God, Jax.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.812
- It's all about...
hope for the best

24:05.845 --> 24:07.480
but prepare for the worst.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.549
You know I've been in trouble
with the law a few times.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.885
- Bail is $11,000.
I'm in shock right now.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.754
What do I do now?
- I'm gonna call the bondsman

24:14.787 --> 24:15.922
right now.
- Yeah.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.791
- I'm sorry.
I feel like a [murmurs].

24:18.825 --> 24:20.827
It's all because of things
that are so silly.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.929
- My mom's only in L.A.
for a week.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.931
I don't want her
to be left out of the roast,

24:24.964 --> 24:26.899
because I don't wanna
leave her by herself.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.035
She's also a tough
Kentucky woman.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.036
She can handle it.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.705
- This looks amazing.
- Got a lotta food here.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.841
- I need some sauce for it.
- You can't put sauce

24:34.874 --> 24:36.609
on a fancy steak like that.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.711
- Oh, yes, I can.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.013
I do have a good story
to tell you about Brittany

24:41.047 --> 24:43.850
when she had her 18th
birthday party at my house.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.852
- Oh, gosh!
I did a theme party,

24:45.885 --> 24:46.986
and guess what I called it.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.988
"G.I. Joes and Army Hos."

24:49.021 --> 24:50.289
[laughter]

24:50.322 --> 24:52.625
Mom's passing around
cookie trays,

24:52.659 --> 24:54.894
and she has no idea that on
the other side of the wall,

24:54.927 --> 24:56.863
there's keggers.
- The cops get called?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.665
- Cops came.
- Oh, sure.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.700
- Mom almost got arrested
for having underage drinking.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.870
So I wasn't the best kid
in the whole world,

25:03.903 --> 25:05.572
I guess, either.
[laughs]

25:05.605 --> 25:07.607
- I used to make
report cards in high school

25:07.640 --> 25:08.875
and sell 'em.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.543
- [laughing]
- Jax!

25:10.577 --> 25:11.878
- I cheated on my SATs.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.946
I had somebody else
take 'em for me.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.748
You know Scantron tests
and the circles?

25:15.782 --> 25:17.750
- Yeah.
- If you put ChapStick

25:17.784 --> 25:19.919
on the side of 'em,
they won't make a mark,

25:19.952 --> 25:22.755
so every time I had
a Scantron test, I got 100%.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.857
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm already speechless

25:24.891 --> 25:26.025
just listening to you,
more or less

25:26.058 --> 25:27.860
what other people's
gonna say.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.696
- Maybe I'm digging myself
in a hole

25:29.729 --> 25:30.930
before I even get there, huh?

25:32.031 --> 25:34.033
- Scheana texted me
saying that

25:34.066 --> 25:35.802
Tom Sandoval
was gonna bring up

25:35.835 --> 25:37.103
the stuff about me and you.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.876
- * At the end,
there's a fork in the road *

25:45.311 --> 25:47.146
* We stand alone,
we stand alone *

25:47.179 --> 25:49.281
* Unbroken...

25:49.315 --> 25:51.083
[knock on door]
- It's open.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.185
- Yo.
- Thanks for coming by.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.622
Wanted to run some of
our material by you.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.056
- Definitely.
- Since you know him

25:57.089 --> 25:59.191
better than anyone.
- I know, I just wanted to see

25:59.225 --> 26:01.160
where, like, you were
going with it too.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.194
- Yeah.
- So wanna hear what

26:02.228 --> 26:03.763
I got so far?
- Okay.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.032
Jax's roast needs
a lot of preparation.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.934
The hardest part is just
like whittling it down

26:07.967 --> 26:11.170
to this perfect...
succinct...

26:11.203 --> 26:12.371
kick to the balls.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.340
- "Wow, Jax you sure
have come a long way

26:14.373 --> 26:16.008
"from bathroom sex at Sur,

26:16.042 --> 26:17.309
"tattooing girls' names
on your arms,

26:17.343 --> 26:19.646
and sleeping with
your best friend's girl."

26:19.679 --> 26:22.014
- Yes, we slept together.

26:22.048 --> 26:25.017
- One I might bring up--
talk about how he's had

26:25.051 --> 26:27.086
two tit jobs this year.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.622
- [laughing]
- Did Kristen insist

26:29.656 --> 26:31.691
on MCing this and, like,
going first?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.693
- They pretty much just,
like, leave me out of

26:33.726 --> 26:35.227
everything
they plan these days,

26:35.261 --> 26:37.997
so I never know
what's going on with them.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.166
Ever since Katie and Stassi
became friends again,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.702
something did change
with her behavior.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.071
We've all seen the wrath
of Tequila Katie.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.238
- Katie gets really mean
when she's drunk.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.974
- Vicious.
- It's vicious.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.642
- Yeah.
- And Kristen and Stassi,

26:49.676 --> 26:51.744
I feel like
they really enable her.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.280
Kristen and Stassi
just agree with Katie

26:54.313 --> 26:56.315
because they don't wanna
stand up to her.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.150
That is textbook enabling.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.186
Like f---ing look it up.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.089
- Full honesty--do you think
Katie has a drinking problem?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.057
- Uh...

27:05.091 --> 27:06.258
yeah, maybe.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.995
- I feel like a lot of us
feel that way,

27:09.028 --> 27:10.196
but no one says it to her.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.363
I mean, Stassi and Kristen

27:11.397 --> 27:13.265
certainly aren't gonna say
anything.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.134
- When you get defensive
like that, it's...

27:15.167 --> 27:18.104
it's a sign of something.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.407
*

27:21.440 --> 27:23.142
- Wait, let me take my card out.
Hold on, hold on.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.312
- Hi, ladies.
Welcome to MedMen.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.280
First-timers?
All right, let's get you set up

27:28.314 --> 27:29.215
with paperwork.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.851
- Everything's so fancy
and, like, clean.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.419
- The Apple store of weed.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.287
[laughs]

27:35.321 --> 27:37.857
- Okay, as far as strains...
I get like this anxiety,

27:37.890 --> 27:41.728
like, and...that also
turns into, like, irritability.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.429
So something that maybe
won't put me to sleep,

27:43.462 --> 27:45.097
but if I just feel like
a little bit,

27:45.131 --> 27:46.465
enough that it might
make me, like,

27:46.498 --> 27:48.200
not wanna kill anyone?

27:48.234 --> 27:51.771
Enough people have told me
that I'm angry when I drink,

27:51.804 --> 27:53.773
so I decided
to do something about it.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.275
- Why cannabis?
- Well, I'm trying to replace

27:56.308 --> 27:58.210
sleeping pills.
- And...Katie.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.846
- Irritability that I have
sometimes

27:59.879 --> 28:02.048
where I can get just,
like, agitated.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.449
- You're both approved.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.718
- I got a marijuana card.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.319
- You can't miss
this shelf.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.455
Foria is suppositories

28:09.488 --> 28:13.192
as well as, like,
sexual lube...

28:13.225 --> 28:14.293
- You spray on your vagina?
- Yeah.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.228
- It helps your pH.
- It helps heighten your senses,

28:16.262 --> 28:19.131
and you just have
endless orgasms.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.867
- Are you kidding me right now?
- I wouldn't lie to you.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.134
- This is a thing?

28:22.168 --> 28:23.269
That I wanna try.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.203
- If you have any questions,

28:24.236 --> 28:25.337
feel free to let us know, okay?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.239
both: Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.076
- Did you work last night?
- Yep.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.211
I got there,
and I was talking to Scheana,

28:32.244 --> 28:34.513
and she said, like,
what is up with Kristen?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.348
She was like, well,
Kristen said that

28:36.382 --> 28:39.318
I hadn't paid my portion
of the several hundred dollars

28:39.351 --> 28:41.353
for your bridal shower.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.822
- That makes me feel
so uncomfortable.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.290
I don't like talking
about money

28:44.323 --> 28:45.357
or talking about
anything like that,

28:45.391 --> 28:47.126
much less in front of
the person

28:47.159 --> 28:49.328
who these things
are gifts for.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.897
Scheana, were you
raised by wolves

28:50.930 --> 28:52.932
in the hills of Azusa?

28:52.965 --> 28:54.801
I was annoyed with Scheana
before.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.368
Now I'm enraged.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.771
Just erase it from your memory--
- I didn't know what to say.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.272
- That's rude.
- I was like, I'm sorry, I don't

29:00.306 --> 29:02.341
want anyone to spend any--
- No, that's rude.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.310
- Part of the reasons
why you have bridesmaids

29:04.343 --> 29:06.412
is to take some stress
off of yourself.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.881
I'm just irritated
and I'm over it.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.250
That's why I feel like
with this

29:11.283 --> 29:12.785
it's not about
getting high all the time.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.254
But I do know
I don't get that

29:15.287 --> 29:17.256
quick, like, agitation
and irritability

29:17.289 --> 29:19.225
where I wanna, like, lash out.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.127
- This is just gonna be
perfect for Schwartz.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.528
- Yeah, maybe rather than
being Tequila Katie

29:22.561 --> 29:25.297
now I can be, you know,
Toking Katie.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.398
- Is that a thing, is that
what it's called, toking?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.366
- Toking. Yeah.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.301
- How do you spell that?
- That's the slang.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.137
- Like yoke or like--

29:31.170 --> 29:32.471
- I don't know. T--
- T-o-k-e

29:32.504 --> 29:34.540
or t-o...
- No, t-o...

29:34.573 --> 29:36.142
- Toking.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.476
- I'm ready to pay
for this sh--.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.979
- I know.
We got so many goodies.

29:40.012 --> 29:43.282
[upbeat pop music]

29:43.315 --> 29:45.184
[knock on door]
- Come in.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.585
- Oh! Kingsley!
Sh--. Sorry I'm late.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.354
- Thanks for coming over.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.590
I just need your help,
big time.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.826
- Hi, King!
Come here!

29:53.860 --> 29:56.495
Oh!
- [laughing]

29:56.528 --> 29:58.898
So you have a whole
note pad, I see.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.867
- So I have a bit
that I'm gonna do at the top.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.368
- Right.
- Since I'm the "Roast Master."

30:02.401 --> 30:04.203
- And you don't have to
tell me everything.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.838
- But then I have like
a little bit for each person

30:05.872 --> 30:07.039
as I introduce them.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.308
- Kristen is helping me
prepare for this roast

30:09.341 --> 30:11.944
because I am nowhere near
a comedian.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.313
I'm only used to doing
beauty pageants

30:14.346 --> 30:15.581
and cheerleading competitions.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.283
- I think it'd be good
to make a joke

30:17.316 --> 30:19.618
about how you moved in
with him, like, so quickly.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.187
- Well, he asked me
to move to L.A.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.188
the first night I met him.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.355
You know that.
- Boom.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.191
And you can talk about his car.
- Yeah, he loves his cars.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.459
Well, the thing about it is
it wouldn't start, so...

30:27.493 --> 30:29.295
He was so embarrassed.
He's like,

30:29.328 --> 30:30.930
"Oh, no, not now.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.298
The car won't start!"
[laughing]

30:32.331 --> 30:33.966
[phone vibrates]

30:35.067 --> 30:37.336
- Scheana just texted me
saying

30:37.369 --> 30:39.471
that Tom Sandoval
was gonna bring up

30:39.505 --> 30:43.475
the stuff that Jax was saying
about me and you.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.610
- What's that?

30:44.643 --> 30:46.245
- Jax walked in on Brittany,

30:46.278 --> 30:47.914
and Kristen was going down
on Brittany.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.281
- You're lying.
- Go ask her.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.616
- What do you think
I'm going to ask her?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.618
- How was it?

30:52.651 --> 30:54.353
- So what's this rumor?

30:54.386 --> 30:55.587
- Okay.

30:55.621 --> 30:59.325
[lightly tense music]

30:59.358 --> 31:00.960
- Do you want me to say it
in very simple terms?

31:00.993 --> 31:02.328
- Yeah.
- Jax made up a rumor

31:02.361 --> 31:03.329
that Brittany and I
hooked up,

31:03.362 --> 31:06.232
and now they wanna
throw it in his face tonight.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.434
- That's not--that's not cool.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.402
- I just know
that you're so...

31:10.436 --> 31:12.238
- No, that's not cool at all.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.007
- This was months ago--
- You never told me about it.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.375
- Well, of course I wasn't gonna
tell you about it.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.244
I'm only telling you
about it now

31:18.277 --> 31:19.979
because of the roast
tonight.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.580
- Well, I'm not--

31:21.613 --> 31:23.649
I don't like it.
I don't like that at all.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.384
- I know.
- I mean, I don't want

31:25.417 --> 31:27.686
any rumors brought up
about my daughter,

31:27.719 --> 31:31.523
because I will pack her bags
and take her back to Kentucky.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.559
- Yeah.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.262
- This is your birthday present.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.563
That engine is running,

31:37.596 --> 31:39.298
but there's nothing
behind the wheel.

31:45.171 --> 31:45.737
- * So here we are

31:46.372 --> 31:48.607
* We got this far

31:48.640 --> 31:50.276
* I got my way

31:50.309 --> 31:52.344
* I got a smile on my face

31:52.378 --> 31:54.113
* Now I'm queen
of the hill...*

31:54.146 --> 31:55.347
- Hey.
- Hi!

31:55.381 --> 31:57.683
- You look so hot!
- Thank you.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.685
- Hey, could you give me
that marijuana lubrication?

31:59.718 --> 32:02.088
'Cause Jax's gonna need it.
He's about to get f---ed.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.956
- Yeah!
[laughter, chatter]

32:03.990 --> 32:05.992
- That was my first zinger.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.659
- Y'all look so good!

32:07.693 --> 32:09.461
- You look hot.
- Thanks.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.163
- Hi.
- Hi!

32:11.197 --> 32:12.464
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi!

32:12.498 --> 32:13.665
- Look how good this looks!

32:13.699 --> 32:15.634
- Brittany, come here, mama.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.970
- What's up?
[overlapping chatter]

32:18.004 --> 32:19.305
- Hi.
- Hi!

32:19.338 --> 32:21.240
- Yeah!

32:21.273 --> 32:23.442
- Happy birthday!

32:23.475 --> 32:25.644
[cheers and applause]

32:25.677 --> 32:27.146
- [laughing]

32:27.179 --> 32:29.315
Aw...

32:29.348 --> 32:30.682
aw...

32:30.716 --> 32:32.351
You look beautiful.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.120
- Look.
- Oh!

32:34.153 --> 32:35.487
- You have to wear it
while you're getting roasted.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.157
If I had to pick one thing that
I don't want to be brought up,

32:38.190 --> 32:39.725
I wouldn't even know.
There's so much

32:39.758 --> 32:41.393
that I'm kind of like...
[sucks in air]

32:41.427 --> 32:44.096
I brought sunglasses, and I'm
definitely gonna need this.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.731
Tums.
[laughter]

32:45.764 --> 32:47.499
I'm hoping that my friends
will be a little lenient,

32:47.533 --> 32:49.501
or I'm not gonna lie to you,
I'm sh---ing bricks.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.203
- Thank you, everyone,
for coming to

32:51.237 --> 32:53.172
the roast of Jax Taylor.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.707
[cheers and applause]

32:55.741 --> 32:58.044
- Yeah. Everyone knows Brittany,
obviously,

32:58.077 --> 32:59.378
but I don't know if you guys
all know

32:59.411 --> 33:01.480
that Sherri, Brittany's mom,
is in town.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.450
Sherri, I'm just gonna
apologize in advance.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.118
- I'm not even gonna
look in this direction.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.686
- Don't. Okay, Jax,

33:07.719 --> 33:09.288
it is your 48th birthday.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.356
[laughter]

33:10.389 --> 33:11.523
- This is 37!
It's not true!

33:11.557 --> 33:14.426
- 40 is a really important
number to you.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.261
It is the number of times

33:15.294 --> 33:17.463
you've given your number out
at work.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.698
It is the number of bottles
you've stolen from Sur.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.500
And it is the exact number
of times

33:21.533 --> 33:23.402
that you and Stassi broke up...

33:23.435 --> 33:25.037
every f---ing weekend.

33:25.071 --> 33:27.039
- Yeah!
- Jax, I'm not saying

33:27.073 --> 33:28.807
that you're dumb.
I'm just saying

33:28.840 --> 33:31.410
I once heard you ask Lisa
what was in a vodka tonic.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.279
[laughter]

33:33.312 --> 33:36.815
Our next roaster
is Ariana Madix's diary,

33:36.848 --> 33:38.384
full of lesbian fantasies

33:38.417 --> 33:40.786
much like your Google
search history, I assume.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.488
Honestly, Ariana and I
feel like we have come

33:42.521 --> 33:44.123
a long way from the days

33:44.156 --> 33:45.724
that we were sleeping
with the same person.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.526
Because I upgraded, so...

33:47.559 --> 33:50.729
all: Ah!

33:50.762 --> 33:52.331
- Ariana Madix.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.766
- I just think
it's cute that Kristen

33:54.800 --> 33:56.568
is so proud of herself

33:56.602 --> 34:00.339
for making really obvious
and kind of typical jokes.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.507
Thank you for the intro,
Kristen.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.142
You might wanna wipe
your mouth.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.311
There's still a little
bullsh-- on the corner.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.347
Also, why are you MCing this?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.149
At least when Jax
f---ed you,

34:10.182 --> 34:13.585
it was so bad that you kept
your mouth shut for once.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.487
- Oh!

34:15.521 --> 34:17.189
- We can trade blows,
but, sweetie,

34:17.223 --> 34:18.557
I'm better at it
than you are.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.792
Jax, the last time
we all celebrated your birthday,

34:20.826 --> 34:22.794
you got arrested
for shoplifting.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.364
But it's okay, because
the only thing you're better at

34:25.397 --> 34:27.133
than getting arrested is,
well...

34:27.166 --> 34:29.301
getting people in Vegas
pregnant.

34:29.335 --> 34:30.502
- Oh!
[scattered laughs]

34:30.536 --> 34:33.105
- Jax loves watching
the "Maury Show"

34:33.139 --> 34:34.573
because it's the only time
he ever hears

34:34.606 --> 34:37.609
you are not the father.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.612
I mean, if you can't be
a good example for people,

34:40.646 --> 34:42.381
you'll just have to be
a horrible warning.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.615
Happy birthday.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.351
[cheers and applause]

34:45.384 --> 34:47.453
- [laughing] Thank you.
- Our next roaster

34:47.486 --> 34:49.621
is going to be
our bride to be...

34:49.655 --> 34:51.523
- Bubba!
- Katie Maloney.

34:51.557 --> 34:52.558
- So far, so good.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.126
This is not really that bad.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.195
- Jax one time said to me

34:56.228 --> 34:57.596
the greatest pleasure
he could have

34:57.629 --> 35:00.232
was to watch my now-fiance

35:00.266 --> 35:02.134
rail a chick in front of me.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.535
- I would love nothing more

35:03.569 --> 35:06.838
than Tom to f---ing rail
a girl right in front of her.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.607
- But you know what?
I get to watch

35:08.640 --> 35:11.877
ten people here tonight
rail you, man!

35:11.910 --> 35:13.612
[whooping]

35:13.645 --> 35:16.415
Jax is very f---ing generous.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.585
One time,
he gave me sunglasses.

35:19.618 --> 35:23.189
Turns out, they were
his ex-girlfriend's!

35:27.259 --> 35:29.361
- You're our red-headed mule.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.529
- Yeah!
- You're the goat

35:30.562 --> 35:32.598
always running around...
- Yeah!

35:32.631 --> 35:35.201
- And for those of you
who don't know what that means,

35:35.234 --> 35:36.902
neither do we.

35:36.935 --> 35:40.539
A lot of things Jax says
don't make sense.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.541
- Like shootin' bullets
in a fish of barrels.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.676
- He's a big boy, he puts his
pants on just, you know...

35:44.710 --> 35:46.278
two feet at a time
like everybody else.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.580
That guy kinda
buried his own bridge. Or--

35:48.614 --> 35:50.549
- One thing I'm really
excited about

35:50.582 --> 35:53.452
is that I'm not the fattest
guy in the group anymore.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.355
all: Oh!
[whooping]

35:56.388 --> 35:58.390
- I would say let's take off
our shirts and see,

35:58.424 --> 36:00.559
but then Schwartz
would get excited,

36:00.592 --> 36:01.593
then he would kiss Sandoval.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.230
- Am I fat?
Am I fat?

36:04.263 --> 36:05.664
- Have you guys ever noticed
how Jax--

36:05.697 --> 36:08.500
it's literally always
allergy season?

36:08.534 --> 36:11.203
Like one of my first
memories of Jax

36:11.237 --> 36:13.605
was in Miami like
f---ing 30 years ago,

36:13.639 --> 36:15.474
and Jax just like
kicks in the door

36:15.507 --> 36:18.477
and he's just like,
"I can't feel my f---ing teeth!"

36:18.510 --> 36:19.978
- The last thing I wanna do

36:20.011 --> 36:21.547
is make any eye contact
with Sherri,

36:21.580 --> 36:24.216
because I really don't know
how she's taking this.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.284
- "Please your girl," he says.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.620
- Satisfy your girlfriend,
we won't have a problem.

36:28.654 --> 36:29.721
How 'bout that?

36:29.755 --> 36:31.357
- Well, if you pleased
your girl,

36:31.390 --> 36:34.593
she definitely wouldn't
have had to jump in bed...

36:34.626 --> 36:36.462
[laughing]

36:36.495 --> 36:37.463
Listen, Jax,

36:37.496 --> 36:40.632
if you think that you're
gonna use Brittany's mom

36:40.666 --> 36:43.502
to soften the blow
of my punches,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.937
you got a f---ing
another think comin'!

36:45.971 --> 36:47.639
By the way,
this is your birthday present.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.007
That engine is running,
but there's nothing

36:49.040 --> 36:50.542
behind the wheel.
- Oh, no.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.011
[whooping, screaming]

36:53.044 --> 36:55.614
- This is you, Jax.
This is your birthday present.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.949
- Oh, my gosh, we drank
too much, baby.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.952
- Happy birthday, man.
- Thank you.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.655
Holy sh--.
This is awesome.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.557
- So I wanna introduce now
my hero.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.026
- Uh-oh.
- This person was the first

37:08.059 --> 37:11.029
to get Jax to admit
that he's a sociopath.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.665
Stassi Schroeder.
Take it away.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.600
- Uh, drink, please.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.768
Make it double.
In fact, make it a triple.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.604
- I was going through
a breakup

37:18.637 --> 37:20.672
and I was working at Sur,
and Kristen was like,

37:20.706 --> 37:22.674
"You know what?
You just need to meet a dude."

37:22.708 --> 37:25.311
So she said, Jax...
- [mouthing]

37:25.344 --> 37:26.978
- I have this girl.
So I'm thinking

37:27.012 --> 37:29.648
I'm gonna go and meet, like,
this prince charming,

37:29.681 --> 37:32.351
someone to get, like,
my mojo back.

37:32.384 --> 37:35.454
And he shows up
with another girl.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.588
So I was turned down.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.724
Now that I'm thinking
back on it,

37:38.757 --> 37:42.428
it was the only time in the two
years that we were together

37:42.461 --> 37:43.995
that he turned a girl down.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.764
all: Oh!

37:45.797 --> 37:47.799
[cheers and applause]

37:47.833 --> 37:50.569
- I'm going to put up
some objects,

37:50.602 --> 37:53.405
and we're gonna figure out
what they all have in common.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.408
So this is Cristal...

37:56.442 --> 37:57.576
this is a sandwich.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.010
- Oh, no!

37:59.044 --> 38:00.312
- My Miu Miu,

38:00.346 --> 38:02.581
and this is
My Trust in Innocence.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.982
[laughter]

38:04.015 --> 38:06.618
So what do all of these
things have in common?

38:09.488 --> 38:11.590
Jax, you can go f--- yourself.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.692
Happy birthday!

38:13.725 --> 38:16.362
That was me
going easy on Jax,

38:16.395 --> 38:19.365
but I respect Brittany enough
not to say anything weird.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.634
- Lisa Vanderpump
sent me a little video.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.736
- So, Mr. Jax Taylor,

38:24.770 --> 38:28.674
what do I wish for you
for your birthday?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.709
Well, I'd like to tell you
what I wish for me.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.678
One thing I wish for me
is I'd like to have

38:32.711 --> 38:35.481
all my stock
that you've stolen

38:35.514 --> 38:36.848
be put back.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.650
I'd also like you

38:38.684 --> 38:42.621
not to post public pictures
of your genitalia.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.556
- Oh!
- And another thing is

38:44.590 --> 38:46.725
I hope for the future
that you spend more time

38:46.758 --> 38:50.429
behind my bar
than you do behind bars.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.630
all: Oh!
- Happy birthday, Jax.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.832
I still love you.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.502
- Obviously, you know
that my mom's here.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.670
It's her first time in L.A.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.672
Jax wants to--
You know he loves his Corvette.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.442
My mom gets in the Corvette
with him.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.610
It won't start.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.545
And all he's saying:
"It needs a warm-up.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.647
It needs a heat-up."
- You gotta baby it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.782
- And I'm just thinking,
I know exactly what you mean.

39:10.816 --> 39:14.853
I know, I know
exactly what you mean.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.657
You stole my heart just like you
stole me the pair of sunglasses.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.792
all: Oh!

39:20.826 --> 39:22.628
- Whoo!

39:22.661 --> 39:25.631
- So Katie has, like,
seven bridesmaids.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.899
Four out of seven
have had sex with Jax.

39:27.933 --> 39:31.737
[lightly edgy music]

39:31.770 --> 39:33.905
If you're one of Katie's
bridesmaids,

39:33.939 --> 39:37.876
there's a 57% chance he's had
his penis inside of you.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.679
I mean, he's slept with many...
- Son of a bitch.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.814
- Many, many women.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.517
And a few men.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.719
- No!
- You know, there's many rumors

39:47.753 --> 39:51.690
floating around about Jax
having a homosexual affair

39:51.723 --> 39:53.692
as a young model in Miami.
- It's not true!

39:53.725 --> 39:55.694
It's really annoying.
They're saying all this sh--

39:55.727 --> 39:57.429
in front of Brittany's mom.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.597
- It's only gay
if you like it.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.732
Listen, those bills--they're
not gonna pay themselves.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.702
- Now I have to defend myself
and let her know

40:03.735 --> 40:06.605
that I do not partake
in any gay activity.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.707
I just wanna say thanks
to Sherri for not leaving.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.108
Thanks for being a good sport.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.142
- Whoo!

40:11.176 --> 40:12.844
[cheers and applause]

40:12.878 --> 40:14.513
Whoo!

40:14.546 --> 40:15.914
- Can't feel my teeth!

40:18.149 --> 40:19.718
- Are we okay?
- We probably are gonna have

40:19.751 --> 40:21.152
a little bit of a talk.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.492
- * Hey,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:27.526 --> 40:30.061
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh... *

40:30.095 --> 40:32.097
[overlapping chatter]
- That's amazing.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.165
- I roast Tom every time
I drink alcohol.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.001
- What up?
- 'Sup?

40:36.034 --> 40:38.036
- You I'm not
super happy with,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.170
and you know that,
'cause I text you earlier

40:39.204 --> 40:42.240
asking you not to do anything
to upset Brittany's mom.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.009
- Dude, this is a roast, man.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.911
- You have so many quips--
- Oh, come on!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.479
- Are you not
more creative than that?

40:47.513 --> 40:49.581
- I had to say--
I had to say--

40:49.615 --> 40:51.016
I had to say--I had to say--
- Do you know Jax came--

40:51.049 --> 40:52.784
- Come on, dude!
- That is all you talked about!

40:52.818 --> 40:53.919
- Come on, really?

40:53.952 --> 40:57.088
What's worse, me talking
about you going down on Brittany

40:57.122 --> 40:58.924
or you going down on Brittany?

40:58.957 --> 41:00.492
Don't be so mad.
Everything's fine.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.761
Don't be so mad!
- So f---ing weird, dude.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.497
I gotta go.
- All right. Bye.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.132
- You did a great job.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.167
You were so scared, mama.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.271
- Where do I begin?
I mean, I-I--

41:13.304 --> 41:15.507
Okay?
Are we okay?

41:15.541 --> 41:18.143
- Um...

41:18.176 --> 41:19.945
kissing the guy.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.179
That was the most offensive
to me

41:21.212 --> 41:23.048
was the homosexual thing.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.250
- I lived with
a gay guy for a while.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.052
He was my best friend.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.020
I did some nudes.
- You did nudes?

41:29.054 --> 41:30.288
Nude photos?
- Actually, you know what?

41:30.321 --> 41:32.123
I still have that picture
in my living room.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.559
Come here!

41:35.226 --> 41:36.294
Aaah!

41:36.327 --> 41:39.064
- Can we just not--I've been
grilled enough tonight.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.031
Can we just go home?

41:40.065 --> 41:42.300
- They talked about it
like it was something--

41:42.333 --> 41:44.169
- I know, because my friends
were giving me a hard time.

41:44.202 --> 41:47.005
Believe me--
- That was a surprise to me too.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.174
- I have a serious problem
with people judging me.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.542
We have to talk at home?

41:50.576 --> 41:51.376
- Yeah, we probably are...
- Okay.

41:51.409 --> 41:52.611
- Gonna have
a little bit of a talk.

41:52.644 --> 41:55.180
- I know that Sherri's a very
conservative Christian lady,

41:55.213 --> 41:57.048
but with all the things
that I've done in my life,

41:57.082 --> 41:59.851
the going to jail,
the cheating, the stealing,

41:59.885 --> 42:01.653
the thing that sticks out most

42:01.687 --> 42:04.122
is that I might have
kissed a guy? Really?

42:04.155 --> 42:06.958
[dramatic music]

42:06.992 --> 42:09.094
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:09.127 --> 42:11.062
- I brought my soon-to-be
groomsmen with me.

42:11.096 --> 42:11.897
- Ariana.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.065
- Slim fits
are what we all want.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.967
- You need
an athletic fit, man.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.169
- What?
- Hey, he's sensitive.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.338
- The bridesmaids
are having another meeting.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.973
I don't know if that's how
usually things roll.

42:22.007 --> 42:25.110
- In your case,
I would get really involved.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.612
- It felt abrasive
to just be like,

42:26.645 --> 42:28.847
"I don't give a f---
about you."

42:28.880 --> 42:30.148
- I don't know
what to tell you.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.883
- This is not coming
[indistinct]

42:31.917 --> 42:33.218
so if we all can't get along,
I don't know.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.086
- Mom's gotta talk to you
about the roast.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.222
- Something about
you being a homosexual.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.024
- It didn't happen.
Either take my word for it,

42:39.057 --> 42:40.291
or you don't.
- There's no need

42:40.325 --> 42:43.361
to have an attitude.
- I'm gonna go.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.063
- James is playing on Friday.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.264
- Should we go?
- Let's do it.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.099
- Thank you for coming!
- Oh...

42:48.133 --> 42:49.200
Later, DJ dipsh--.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.636
[tense music]

42:50.669 --> 42:52.904
[overlapping shouting]

42:52.938 --> 42:53.905
- You're f---ing losers!

42:53.939 --> 42:55.373
- To see more
