WEBVTT

00:52.169 --> 00:54.504
- How you doing tonight?
- Doing well, Officer.

00:54.538 --> 00:55.740
Can I see your
driver's license,

00:55.773 --> 00:57.441
registration
and insurance, please?

00:57.474 --> 00:59.744
Of course. My license
is right here in my wallet.

01:01.779 --> 01:03.547
I need to reach past my
14 year-old son

01:03.581 --> 01:05.415
to get my registration
insurance from the glove box.

01:05.449 --> 01:06.483
- Is that all right?
- Sure.

01:06.516 --> 01:07.517
Okay.

01:08.553 --> 01:09.821
One second, my son.

01:09.854 --> 01:10.888
You live in the area?

01:10.922 --> 01:12.322
No, sir.

01:12.356 --> 01:13.758
Where you
coming from?

01:13.791 --> 01:15.827
Picking up my son
from a friend's house.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.495
Here you go.

01:20.230 --> 01:21.365
You're on parole
or have any warrants

01:21.398 --> 01:22.734
- I should know about?
- No, sir.

01:24.602 --> 01:26.436
Are you aware your insurance
has expired?

01:28.405 --> 01:30.742
Uh, it must be
an old copy...

01:30.775 --> 01:32.710
The car definitely
has insurance.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.244
Uh, I might
have a new copy...

01:34.277 --> 01:36.313
Hey, keep your hands
where I can see them, sir.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.584
Relax. Right here, sir.
Right here.

01:39.617 --> 01:41.552
It's okay. It's all right.
It's all right.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.656
Oh, thank you.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.456
Can I have you step out
of the vehicle?

01:47.825 --> 01:50.293
Uh, sure.
Undo my seatbelt.

01:51.395 --> 01:53.698
It's okay.
It's all right.

01:53.731 --> 01:55.432
It's all right, Son.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.837
- Hands up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:59.871 --> 02:01.105
Wait, wait, wait.

02:01.139 --> 02:02.205
- Sir, sir, sir he's a kid.
- Put your hands on the dashboard

02:02.239 --> 02:05.208
right now. Drop the whatever
you have in your hand.

02:05.242 --> 02:06.376
- Put the phone down.
- It's my phone.

02:06.410 --> 02:07.344
- It's my phone.
- Sir, it's a phone.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.346
It's a cell phone,
it's just a cell phone.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.848
Put the phone down.

02:10.882 --> 02:13.584
Exit the car and put
your hands in the air.

02:13.618 --> 02:14.719
Officer, please.
He's just a kid.

02:14.752 --> 02:16.453
- I can talk to him.
- Please, he's just a kid.

02:16.486 --> 02:17.922
Exit the car
with your hands in the air.

02:17.955 --> 02:20.257
He's gonna get out.
Okay, get out of the car son.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.893
Easy, easy.

02:21.926 --> 02:24.327
- It's just a phone.
- I need you to put the phone away.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.263
Put the phone away
and sit on the curb.

02:26.296 --> 02:27.932
He's unarmed, okay.
He's just...

02:27.965 --> 02:30.300
- Sir, just let us do our job.
- Put the phone away and sit on the curb.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.402
- Put the fucking phone away.
- Put it down!

02:32.436 --> 02:33.838
Put the fucking phone away!

02:48.586 --> 02:49.987
May I help you?

02:50.021 --> 02:52.456
Linc, I'm Jordin King.

02:52.489 --> 02:53.925
We talked a few times
on the phone.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.695
The student filmmaker.

02:57.729 --> 03:00.798
We spoke about me possibly
doing some interviews with you

03:00.832 --> 03:02.399
around what happened
to your son.

03:05.570 --> 03:06.571
Come on in.

03:07.471 --> 03:08.472
Come on.

03:09.539 --> 03:10.540
Come on.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.415
A mark.

03:20.383 --> 03:21.384
B mark.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.456
Just put
the belt pack on.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.759
Who will all this be seen by?

03:27.792 --> 03:29.694
My class mostly.

03:29.727 --> 03:30.895
Professors, staff.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.362
If people respond to it,

03:32.395 --> 03:34.632
we'll try and get it
into some festivals.

03:35.099 --> 03:36.134
Festivals?

03:36.167 --> 03:38.970
A festival is like
a group of public screenings.

03:39.003 --> 03:41.338
Only, it's curated.

03:41.371 --> 03:43.440
People get dressed up,
they go see it,

03:43.473 --> 03:44.609
and when it's over,

03:44.642 --> 03:46.711
everyone looks around
for reactions.

03:46.744 --> 03:48.579
If the right people
hate it, it dies,

03:48.613 --> 03:50.081
and if the right
people love it,

03:50.114 --> 03:51.983
we get a chance
to bring it to the world.

03:54.118 --> 03:57.922
So this could be seen
by people over the world.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.490
It's possible.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.630
What's that?

04:05.663 --> 04:06.697
That's B cam.

04:06.731 --> 04:09.567
Just another angle,
something behind the scenes.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.070
So I've got
some questions,

04:13.104 --> 04:15.505
kind of all over the place.

04:15.539 --> 04:17.541
Some easy stuff,
some hard.

04:17.575 --> 04:19.476
Anything you don't
feel like answering,

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
you don't have to.

04:22.546 --> 04:24.081
Can you say your name
into the camera?

04:25.783 --> 04:27.852
Um, Lincoln Jefferson.

04:27.885 --> 04:28.953
I go by Linc.

04:30.121 --> 04:32.489
By now, a lot of people
know about KJ

04:32.522 --> 04:34.725
and what happened
to him.

04:34.759 --> 04:36.894
But few people know
who KJ was

04:36.928 --> 04:42.432
or what he was like.
In one word or a sentence even,

04:42.465 --> 04:43.601
how would you
describe him?

04:49.874 --> 04:52.844
You know, um,
I can show you

04:52.877 --> 04:55.046
better than
I can tell you.

04:59.150 --> 05:02.519
<i>What happens when old people
act like they're young people?</i>

05:04.088 --> 05:05.089
Is that you?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.291
<i>Kind of.</i>

05:07.325 --> 05:09.426
<i>I'm not trying to spend
Christmas in an emergency room.</i>

05:09.459 --> 05:11.696
<i>Okay, y'all know me
and how much I can do.</i>

05:12.230 --> 05:14.497
<i>Oh!</i>

05:18.936 --> 05:21.404
It was all the time,
every day he was um...

05:22.640 --> 05:23.908
He was just funny.

05:23.941 --> 05:26.878
Um, smart,

05:26.911 --> 05:30.181
uh, just an all around
good kid, you know?

05:30.214 --> 05:32.449
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

05:40.691 --> 05:44.061
Can you tell me what happened
on July 3rd of last year?

05:46.697 --> 05:48.431
- Put it away!
- Please, listen...

05:57.241 --> 05:59.509
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

05:59.542 --> 06:00.578
You're welcome.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.213
Oh, no, I'm good.
Thank you.

06:02.246 --> 06:03.614
Oh, no,
I'm good. Thank you.

06:03.648 --> 06:04.682
Okay.

06:04.715 --> 06:06.651
You just
put this right here.

06:06.684 --> 06:07.919
All right.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.220
And you can put
the belt pack on yourself.

06:09.253 --> 06:10.554
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.603
Linc said you helped raise KJ
when he was a baby.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.538
Yeah, I did.

06:28.572 --> 06:30.841
I helped raise
all my grandkids.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.177
You know,
Linc and Tayana

06:33.210 --> 06:34.946
well, they kind of
started out young,

06:34.979 --> 06:36.881
like, you know,
a lot of people do,

06:36.914 --> 06:39.717
but you just do
what you can to help.

06:41.852 --> 06:43.788
You know,
he went to the service.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.891
Iraq. Kept us safe.

06:48.525 --> 06:51.729
Did what he had to do
and for him to come back

06:51.762 --> 06:53.597
and for them to treat him
like they do...

06:53.631 --> 06:55.232
- Mom.
- No. Now, you know that ain't right.

06:58.202 --> 07:00.204
Now he did good
by KJ.

07:00.237 --> 07:03.107
He had him, going to
one of those top schools, too.

07:03.941 --> 07:04.976
On the pass.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.043
A pass?

07:06.077 --> 07:08.579
A pass is like a permit.

07:08.612 --> 07:10.047
Yeah 'cause I worked
in the district.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.116
That was how I was able
to get him into school.

07:12.149 --> 07:15.820
Yeah, that KJ,
he was a good boy.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.989
I mean, he started, you know,
acting out a little

07:18.022 --> 07:20.791
when Tayana and Linc split.

07:20.825 --> 07:25.528
But, I mean, that's normal
for boys at age 13.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.765
That's when
you lose them.

07:27.798 --> 07:29.834
But when he moved in
with Linc, you know,

07:30.334 --> 07:31.602
it settled him down.

07:32.336 --> 07:34.238
A boy needs
a man in his life.

07:34.271 --> 07:35.740
I mean, he ought
to have one.

07:35.773 --> 07:38.843
I mean, how else
is he supposed to know

07:38.876 --> 07:40.277
what a man
is supposed to act like

07:40.311 --> 07:41.812
or if he's
one himself?

07:43.681 --> 07:46.751
That boy
was all that Linc had

07:46.784 --> 07:47.885
and they took him away.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.720
For nothing.

07:52.289 --> 07:55.092
I mean, if, if it would
have happened,

07:55.126 --> 07:57.561
you know, if he lived
in this neighborhood,

07:57.595 --> 08:00.831
it would have made
more sense.

08:00.865 --> 08:02.666
Make more sense how?

08:02.700 --> 08:04.135
These young boys
get beat down

08:04.168 --> 08:06.971
by the cops or worse
all the time.

08:07.004 --> 08:11.242
More instances of police
brutality in poor communities?

08:11.275 --> 08:14.712
No, baby. More instances
of police brutality

08:14.745 --> 08:16.714
in Black communities.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.005
Seriously?

08:41.038 --> 08:43.974
Come on, I get these
priceless moments.

08:44.008 --> 08:47.011
- Why?
- First day of school, new school.

08:47.044 --> 08:48.712
Tell me how it went.

08:48.746 --> 08:51.882
It was... It was crazy.

08:51.916 --> 08:53.984
Okay, crazy good
or crazy bad?

08:54.718 --> 08:55.953
Crazy weird.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.022
Lockers outside,

08:58.055 --> 09:00.257
they play rap during lunch,
which is hilarious.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.325
Mmm-hmm.

09:01.358 --> 09:02.993
Gucci Mane on the loudspeakers.

09:03.027 --> 09:05.629
Gucci!

09:05.663 --> 09:08.632
White people everywhere,
heads bobbin' off-beat.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.934
It was like
a <i>Key and Peele</i> skit.

09:11.502 --> 09:14.205
But everybody's cool.

09:15.339 --> 09:17.174
A lot of them
extra cool.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.210
Probably just want to say
they're hanging out

09:19.243 --> 09:20.811
with the only black kid
in school.

09:22.913 --> 09:25.749
But no drama.

09:25.783 --> 09:28.119
They have like these mini
restaurants in the school.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.855
And you can have just about
anything you want.

09:36.093 --> 09:38.696
And there wasn't even
one fight all day.

10:04.989 --> 10:07.258
How do you feel you two
splitting up affected him?

10:10.394 --> 10:12.696
It's hard to tell,
but I'm sure it did.

10:14.899 --> 10:16.901
You know, Tayana, she's...

10:16.934 --> 10:18.135
She was such
a great mother.

10:18.169 --> 10:21.972
I mean,
great mother

10:22.006 --> 10:23.274
and we wanted
to make it work.

10:23.307 --> 10:25.209
But once I got back
from the military,

10:26.143 --> 10:28.312
everything changed.

10:28.345 --> 10:31.248
You know, I had some... Some things
I wanted to do when I got back.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.349
Some dreams.

10:32.383 --> 10:36.120
And people don't really talk
about the thing you face

10:36.153 --> 10:37.154
when you come home.

10:38.255 --> 10:39.957
Financial hardships,

10:39.990 --> 10:41.325
dealing with unemployment,

10:41.358 --> 10:44.195
problems trying to get help
from the VA.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.730
You know, all that stuff
can really hurt your pride.

10:48.132 --> 10:51.869
Hmm, it just...
It really took a toll on us.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.238
Hmm.

10:55.806 --> 10:56.840
Where did you serve?

10:57.341 --> 10:58.375
Two tours in Iraq.

10:59.410 --> 11:01.312
Twenty one months,
all in all.

11:01.345 --> 11:04.481
Wow. What did you do?

11:04.982 --> 11:06.417
Infantry rifleman.

11:10.555 --> 11:12.256
What was that like?

11:14.158 --> 11:15.159
It was war.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.499
I see he was into Malcolm.

11:22.533 --> 11:25.469
Yeah, he was definitely
into Malcolm.

11:25.502 --> 11:28.539
Yeah, he asked
a lot of questions,

11:28.573 --> 11:31.809
and I tried to teach him
a lot about

11:31.842 --> 11:35.312
who he was knowing his history,
his identity,

11:35.346 --> 11:36.947
knowing his rights.

11:36.981 --> 11:38.215
He was into it.

11:38.249 --> 11:41.218
I mean, he even got the school
to teach on the Black Panthers

11:41.252 --> 11:42.486
during Black History Month.

11:42.519 --> 11:44.855
Which was a really
proud moment.

11:48.826 --> 11:50.828
Did you ever talk
to him about the police?

11:59.203 --> 12:02.339
<i>So you're saying
by law,</i>

12:04.609 --> 12:09.146
<i>you can resist the cops,
like you can fight them back?</i>

12:09.179 --> 12:10.514
<i>Yeah. If you
didn't do nothing.</i>

12:10.948 --> 12:12.249
<i>Who said that?</i>

12:13.250 --> 12:14.485
<i>The US Supreme Court.</i>

12:18.389 --> 12:21.358
<i>"One has an unalienable right
to protect his life,</i>

12:21.392 --> 12:24.295
<i>"liberty or property
from unlawful attack or harm.</i>

12:24.328 --> 12:26.330
<i>"Therefore, it's not
an offense to liberate</i>

12:26.363 --> 12:29.099
<i>"one from the unlawful
custody of an officer."</i>

12:29.133 --> 12:31.969
<i>So that's really what they're
teaching with the white kids?</i>

12:32.002 --> 12:34.271
<i>Hey, it sounds
like bullshit to me.</i>

12:34.305 --> 12:35.372
<i>That's 'cause you're
stuck in the school</i>

12:35.406 --> 12:36.473
<i>where they
don't teach you shit.</i>

12:36.507 --> 12:38.275
<i>If the cop don't conform
to the law of the land,</i>

12:38.309 --> 12:40.210
<i>I can resist
and protect myself.</i>

12:41.211 --> 12:42.246
<i>It's just the law.</i>

12:43.648 --> 12:44.848
<i>What's up?</i>

12:44.882 --> 12:48.385
<i>Hey, just studying for the
government test tomorrow.</i>

12:49.887 --> 12:51.088
<i>Studying, huh?</i>

12:51.121 --> 12:53.524
- <i>What's up Mr. Linc.</i>
- <i>What up, Jonah?</i>

12:53.558 --> 12:55.259
<i>What were you just saying,
just now?</i>

12:55.292 --> 12:57.061
<i>Telling Jonah
what we learned in class.</i>

12:57.094 --> 12:57.961
<i>He don't believe it.</i>

12:57.995 --> 12:59.863
<i>The law says
you can defend yourself</i>

12:59.897 --> 13:02.099
<i>from an unlawful attack
from anybody</i>

13:02.132 --> 13:03.367
<i>even the police, right?</i>

13:05.235 --> 13:07.371
- <i>Well...</i>
- <i>He's crazy, right, Mr. Linc?</i>

13:07.404 --> 13:09.574
- <i>I mean, he's technically right.</i>
- <i>Technically?</i>

13:09.607 --> 13:12.577
- <i>Well, yes, in theory...</i>
- <i>But the law is the law.</i>

13:14.044 --> 13:15.580
<i>"A citizen illegally arrested</i>

13:15.613 --> 13:17.247
<i>"cannot initiate
the use of force,</i>

13:17.281 --> 13:19.651
<i>"and neither do words alone
justify an assault."</i>

13:19.684 --> 13:21.452
- <i>Hey, KJ...</i>
- <i>"However, when the officer</i>

13:21.485 --> 13:23.287
<i>"initiates the assault
by physical contact..."</i>

13:23.320 --> 13:24.521
- <i>All right listen to me.</i>
- <i>"...which is the case..."</i>

13:24.556 --> 13:25.790
- <i>What I'm trying to tell you...</i>
- <i>"There's an unlawful..."</i>

13:25.824 --> 13:26.924
- <i>There is a difference...</i>
- <i>"...arrest, there, a citizen</i>

13:26.957 --> 13:29.193
<i>"has a right to protect his
liberty, to the extent</i>

13:29.226 --> 13:31.161
- <i>"of killing the officer..."</i>
- <i>Look... Stop, all right? Stop!</i>

13:31.962 --> 13:33.297
<i>Don't say those words.</i>

13:34.098 --> 13:35.866
<i>All right.
Don't even think them.</i>

13:37.669 --> 13:39.503
<i>Hey, um, I'll call
you back later.</i>

13:39.536 --> 13:42.272
<i>No, no, no. Stay on, Jonah.
You need to hear this too.</i>

13:45.175 --> 13:48.646
<i>Look, citizens
have rights, yes.</i>

13:48.680 --> 13:52.082
<i>There are all kinds of laws and
documents and cases that say so.</i>

13:52.116 --> 13:53.317
<i>But the citizens
they're talking about</i>

13:53.350 --> 13:54.518
<i>don't always look like us.</i>

13:54.552 --> 13:56.453
<i>Especially not to the police.</i>

13:56.487 --> 13:59.691
- <i>But the Supreme Court...</i>
- <i>I understand that.</i>

13:59.724 --> 14:02.226
<i>What you need to understand
is those laws</i>

14:02.259 --> 14:04.962
<i>weren't written
with us in mind.</i>

14:04.995 --> 14:06.497
<i>And anyone that tells you
differently, is either white</i>

14:06.530 --> 14:09.266
<i>or just lucky they haven't had
to put it to the test yet.</i>

14:09.299 --> 14:12.035
<i>So I'm just supposed to forget
everything you ever told me</i>

14:12.069 --> 14:13.605
<i>about self-respect and dignity</i>

14:13.638 --> 14:15.139
<i>and standing up
for what I believe in?</i>

14:15.172 --> 14:19.209
<i>Yes, yes. If it means you're coming
home to me safely, absolutely.</i>

14:19.243 --> 14:21.078
<i>I know it doesn't
make sense to you now,</i>

14:21.111 --> 14:22.479
<i>but one day
when you have kids</i>

14:22.513 --> 14:24.548
<i>it'll be crystal clear,
trust me.</i>

14:27.251 --> 14:28.252
<i>Look at me.</i>

14:32.456 --> 14:34.224
<i>When you're dealing
with the police</i>

14:34.258 --> 14:35.593
<i>you don't think of laws.</i>

14:35.627 --> 14:38.195
<i>You don't think of rights.
None of that.</i>

14:38.228 --> 14:42.533
<i>You just do whatever they say, their way.
All right?</i>

14:42.567 --> 14:43.668
<i>That way you will live.</i>

14:45.035 --> 14:46.403
<i>Could live
to make it home to me.</i>

14:48.505 --> 14:49.607
<i>You understand?</i>

14:52.744 --> 14:54.044
What's up, guys?

14:59.316 --> 15:00.618
Wow.

15:00.652 --> 15:02.186
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

15:03.454 --> 15:04.455
Nadir.

15:08.225 --> 15:09.426
This is what
you get.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.529
It was well worth it, you know.

15:12.564 --> 15:14.364
Anyone would want
their kids to go here.

15:23.140 --> 15:26.143
No one dreams
of coming out of the service

15:26.176 --> 15:27.679
and becoming a custodian,

15:27.712 --> 15:32.349
but I knew I had to do something to
get him out of the situation he was in.

15:32.382 --> 15:35.219
Wanted to take advantage
of the opportunities here

15:35.252 --> 15:37.755
and when I asked, you know,
how to get him in,

15:37.789 --> 15:39.423
first thing they said is
"You gotta live here,

15:39.456 --> 15:40.692
"or have a job here.".

15:40.725 --> 15:42.526
The houses start
at a million dollars,

15:42.560 --> 15:44.194
so I knew that wasn't
gonna happen.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.230
So I applied.

15:47.264 --> 15:49.601
Why do you think
you stayed after, um...

15:51.134 --> 15:52.302
After a year and a half?

15:53.470 --> 15:55.573
- Why I stayed?
- Yeah.

16:06.517 --> 16:08.118
I don't know. Routine.

16:14.525 --> 16:16.326
Get that bucket.

16:31.308 --> 16:32.509
How are you
and Linc related?

16:33.377 --> 16:37.447
We're brothers,
not blood brothers.

16:37.481 --> 16:40.752
We are blood brother,
it's not biological, as I put it.

16:42.754 --> 16:44.756
How'd you meet?

16:44.789 --> 16:48.358
Overseas. Same squad,
same fire team.

16:48.392 --> 16:50.628
Lincoln and I actually
grew up near each other.

16:50.662 --> 16:51.829
Just never met.

16:53.898 --> 16:55.198
It's something else.

16:55.232 --> 16:56.568
But, you know,
same old story.

16:56.601 --> 16:58.402
Came up hard,
was no kind of student.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.137
You mess up enough times

17:00.170 --> 17:02.406
it's only a matter of time
before you get locked up.

17:04.809 --> 17:06.109
How old are you?

17:06.143 --> 17:07.679
I'm 21.

17:07.712 --> 17:09.714
When I was a little bit
younger than you,

17:09.747 --> 17:11.181
I went into the Marines.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.886
You served
in the Middle East together.

17:14.919 --> 17:17.387
- We did.
- Can you elaborate?

17:18.355 --> 17:19.356
Nah.

17:20.825 --> 17:22.259
It's kind of crazy
how hard

17:22.292 --> 17:24.762
it is to get people
to talk about it.

17:24.796 --> 17:26.831
Yeah, you have to live it
to understand why.

17:29.601 --> 17:30.802
You were
in the hospital.

17:31.836 --> 17:33.303
Yeah, chemo.

17:34.404 --> 17:36.106
Last treatment
was this morning.

17:37.174 --> 17:38.843
Wow. Congrats, man.

17:40.344 --> 17:41.511
I didn't say I beat it.

17:42.714 --> 17:44.314
I said it was the
last treatment.

17:44.348 --> 17:45.349
First and last.

17:45.850 --> 17:47.752
I looked like shit.

17:47.785 --> 17:49.687
I feel like shit.
I ain't doing that again.

17:51.623 --> 17:53.423
Doctors say it metastasized.

17:53.457 --> 17:55.125
- Meaning...
- I-I know what it means.

17:56.426 --> 17:57.427
Hmm.

17:58.830 --> 18:01.531
So anyway, yeah, I figured
why lose my hair, you know?

18:01.566 --> 18:03.735
If I lose weight,
dying before it kills me...

18:03.768 --> 18:05.703
Nah, I ain't got long.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.605
I'll just ride it out.

18:09.841 --> 18:10.875
I'm sorry.

18:13.243 --> 18:14.244
It is what it is.

18:15.780 --> 18:16.781
Got it right here.

18:18.548 --> 18:19.884
This is it.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.451
It is what it is.

18:21.485 --> 18:24.354
Don't you ever forget that.
It is what it is.

18:24.388 --> 18:26.658
All right, all right.
Let's go.

18:26.691 --> 18:28.559
Oh, you're good, bro.
We'll be back.

18:28.593 --> 18:31.763
Linc, can you give a little
background on what's happening?

18:31.796 --> 18:32.930
Into the camera?

18:36.433 --> 18:38.936
Yeah, we're headed
to the courthouse

18:38.970 --> 18:40.838
for the grand jury decision

18:40.872 --> 18:43.608
and, uh,
we are optimistic

18:44.274 --> 18:45.743
and we hope
it goes our way.

18:46.978 --> 18:48.579
- Good?
- Good.

18:48.613 --> 18:50.480
All right. All right,
let's go, let's go.

18:50.514 --> 18:51.548
Let's head out.

18:51.582 --> 18:52.917
- What do we want?
- Justice.

18:52.950 --> 18:54.451
- When do we want it?
- Now!

18:54.484 --> 18:55.853
- What do we want?
- Justice.

18:55.887 --> 18:57.320
- When do we want it?
- Now!

18:57.354 --> 18:58.589
- What do we want?
- Justice.

18:58.623 --> 18:59.757
- When do we want it?
- Now!

18:59.791 --> 19:01.358
- What do we want?
- Justice.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.627
- When do we want it?
- Now!

19:02.660 --> 19:04.227
- What do we want?
- Justice.

19:04.261 --> 19:05.495
- When do we want it?
- Now!

19:05.529 --> 19:06.564
- What do we want?
- Justice.

19:06.597 --> 19:09.533
We're here live outside
the LA County courthouse.

19:09.567 --> 19:11.435
Where, as you can see
behind me,

19:11.468 --> 19:14.739
both protesters and police
supporters are waiting

19:14.772 --> 19:17.875
to see if Officer Mike Randall
will be indicted

19:17.909 --> 19:20.544
on charges stemming
from last year's shooting

19:20.578 --> 19:23.413
of 14-year old
Kajani Jefferson.

19:23.447 --> 19:24.849
Justice for Kajani!

19:24.882 --> 19:26.516
Justice for Kajani!

19:26.550 --> 19:27.819
Justice for Kajani!

19:27.852 --> 19:29.787
- Justice for Kajani.
- Back the blue.

19:29.821 --> 19:31.756
- Justice for Kajani!
- Back the blue!

19:31.789 --> 19:33.423
Justice for Kajan!

19:33.457 --> 19:34.992
Justice for Kajani!

19:35.026 --> 19:37.662
After their exhaustive
review of the evidence,

19:37.695 --> 19:39.997
the grand jury deliberated
over two days,

19:40.031 --> 19:41.766
making their
final decision.

19:41.799 --> 19:44.702
They determined that no
probable cause exists

19:44.736 --> 19:47.772
to file any charges
against Officer Randall.

19:47.805 --> 19:51.508
They returned a no true bill
on each of the five claims.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.311
- The physical...
- Officer Randall will be returning to service

19:54.344 --> 19:58.248
effective immediately according to
standard protocol in such cases.

19:59.617 --> 20:00.985
Excuse me, Officer.

20:01.018 --> 20:04.354
Listen, I need to talk to you,
I just need to know why.

20:04.387 --> 20:06.356
Can you just tell me why?
Please don't...

20:06.389 --> 20:07.357
So you're
gonna shoot me?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.627
Is that what you're
gonna do shoot me, right?

20:09.660 --> 20:11.461
Because I have
a gun, right?

20:11.495 --> 20:13.430
Because I'm a threat, right?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.932
You coward!

20:14.966 --> 20:16.567
You hide behind that badge.

20:16.601 --> 20:18.035
You're a coward!

20:18.069 --> 20:19.737
I lost my baby.

20:35.753 --> 20:36.754
Ah, man.

20:39.456 --> 20:40.490
It's okay.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.095
It's gonna be
all right.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.636
You're all right.
You're all right.

20:52.603 --> 20:53.871
Okay?

20:55.840 --> 20:56.841
You'll be all right.

21:11.789 --> 21:14.125
<i>The announcement
of a grand jury's decision</i>

21:14.158 --> 21:16.828
not to indict San Vacilo
police officer Mike Randall

21:16.861 --> 21:19.897
in the shooting death of
unarmed teen Kajani Jefferson

21:19.931 --> 21:21.966
was met with chaos
on Tuesday night.

21:41.052 --> 21:42.787
Miss Jefferson,
I need your help.

21:42.820 --> 21:45.623
Uh, the city
need your help.

21:47.725 --> 21:49.727
Make a statement
on camera.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.930
Tell the community
that violence is not the way.

21:52.964 --> 21:54.899
Man, do you hear yourself?

21:54.932 --> 21:56.167
Talking all that
no violence bullshit.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.869
Y'all niggas should have
thought about that shit

21:57.902 --> 21:59.103
before y'all killed
my cousin, man.

21:59.136 --> 22:00.605
Can you please
turn that off?

22:00.638 --> 22:01.706
Can you please
get the fuck out!

22:01.739 --> 22:03.107
Jayden, stop!

22:04.742 --> 22:07.979
Look, I can
only imagine

22:09.013 --> 22:11.616
- how you're feeling right now...
- Do you have kids?

22:12.617 --> 22:14.417
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mmm.

22:14.451 --> 22:16.053
- Two little girls.
- Are they breathing?

22:17.188 --> 22:18.789
Hmm?

22:18.823 --> 22:20.925
You couldn't possibly
imagine how I feel.

22:20.958 --> 22:23.060
You have no idea
how I feel.

22:23.094 --> 22:24.427
- You're right.
- I know.

22:24.461 --> 22:26.097
- Yes, ma'am, you're right.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.933
And I'm truly
sorry for your loss,

22:28.966 --> 22:31.102
but we can't change the past.

22:31.135 --> 22:32.904
Man, fuck you.

22:32.937 --> 22:35.039
What the fuck! Now you want
to talk all this peace shit?

22:35.072 --> 22:36.207
So no one else
gets hurt?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.776
Where the fuck was all that
when y'all killed KJ, huh?

22:38.809 --> 22:40.111
- Fuck, nigga.
- Look, young man,

22:40.144 --> 22:42.013
- I'm gonna need you to calm down.
- Man, I don't give a fuck.

22:42.046 --> 22:43.814
- Don't "young man" me. None of that shit!
- Right now.

22:43.848 --> 22:45.082
I don't give a fuck.

22:45.116 --> 22:47.919
- You work in public service, motherfucker.
- <i>Calm down!</i>

22:47.952 --> 22:49.053
What the fuck?

22:49.086 --> 22:50.121
Y'all see this, right?

22:51.789 --> 22:53.858
I'm right here in my
auntie's house. Right?

22:53.891 --> 22:55.993
I ain't got no gun.
None of that.

22:56.027 --> 22:57.728
Just chilling in my
auntie's house. All right.

22:57.762 --> 22:59.797
Trying to have...
Trying to have a normal conversation

22:59.830 --> 23:01.098
and they want
to kill me like they did KJ.

23:01.132 --> 23:02.266
Jayden, stop!

23:02.300 --> 23:04.035
You wanna kill me
right here in my auntie house?

23:04.068 --> 23:05.736
- This is not helping.
- Answer the question.

23:05.770 --> 23:07.939
Huh?
Answer the question, nigga.

23:07.972 --> 23:10.107
You wanna kill me
like you did my cousin?

23:10.141 --> 23:11.742
I'm trying
to fix things.

23:11.776 --> 23:13.577
You see this picture
right here, bro?

23:14.912 --> 23:15.913
Fourteen years old.

23:16.747 --> 23:17.915
That's my blood, bro.

23:17.949 --> 23:19.951
- I understand...
- You lived your life.

23:19.984 --> 23:21.619
- I understand...
- You lived your life already,

23:21.652 --> 23:22.954
- old ass nigga.
- This is not gonna help.

23:22.987 --> 23:25.589
- This is my little cousin.
- This is not helping.

23:25.623 --> 23:27.258
This is not helping.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.826
I understand you're upset,

23:30.194 --> 23:31.896
but I'm here
to help.

23:31.929 --> 23:33.097
You ain't here
to do shit.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.266
I'm not the enemy
here, okay?

23:35.299 --> 23:38.703
Please, everybody,
let's just take a second.

23:38.736 --> 23:39.904
Take a breath.

23:39.937 --> 23:42.206
At least
step over there, sir.

23:42.239 --> 23:43.874
- Can you step out?
- They're fine.

23:43.908 --> 23:45.209
- They ain't fine.
- They're fine.

23:45.242 --> 23:46.978
Get the fuck out of my aunties house, bro.

23:47.011 --> 23:48.746
- We'll have the cameras here...
- Okay.

23:48.779 --> 23:50.014
- ...in an hour.
- What the fuck.

23:50.047 --> 23:52.083
Ain't making no fucking statements.

23:52.116 --> 23:53.250
- Jayden.
- Fuck wrong with 'em.

23:53.284 --> 23:54.652
- Jayden.
- We ain't doing none of that.

23:54.685 --> 23:55.720
- Jayden!
- Bye!

23:55.753 --> 23:57.054
Bye, Uncle Tom.

23:57.088 --> 23:58.656
- Stop!
- Weird ass nigga.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.024
- <i>What we want?</i>
- <i>Justice.</i>

24:00.057 --> 24:01.025
- <i>When do we want it?</i>
- <i>Now!</i>

24:01.058 --> 24:02.393
- <i>What we want?</i>
- <i>Justice!</i>

24:02.426 --> 24:03.961
- <i>When do we want it?</i>
- <i>Now!</i>

24:03.995 --> 24:05.796
<i>As we all know, I...</i>

24:08.866 --> 24:10.868
<i>I lost my son
over a year ago.</i>

24:12.069 --> 24:15.006
<i>I had to bury
my only son.</i>

24:15.039 --> 24:18.843
<i>Now, we did not get the
indictment that we hoped for.</i>

24:18.876 --> 24:22.013
<i>And justice
was not served yet.</i>

24:22.046 --> 24:23.881
<i>And all we want
is peace.</i>

24:23.914 --> 24:25.049
<i>That's all we want.</i>

24:28.119 --> 24:30.554
<i>So we need to stop
the rioting</i>

24:30.588 --> 24:32.656
<i>and we need
to stop the violence.</i>

24:32.690 --> 24:34.592
Violence took
his ass from us.

24:36.127 --> 24:37.261
You see this,
how it goes?

24:38.062 --> 24:39.730
You understand?

24:39.764 --> 24:41.766
A cop killed
another one of our babies.

24:43.167 --> 24:44.802
People want answers.

24:44.835 --> 24:47.004
People mad as hell.
They ready to tear shit up?

24:47.038 --> 24:51.342
The first thing they do,
they put the mom on the TV.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.878
That's the way they figure
if a child's mother

24:53.911 --> 24:55.646
ain't ready to see shit
burned down,

24:55.679 --> 24:57.815
then why should anyone else.
Shit is diabolical.

24:58.382 --> 24:59.850
<i>We don't want revenge.</i>

24:59.884 --> 25:01.285
<i>We want justice.</i>

25:01.318 --> 25:03.654
They kill my son and they
go right back to work.

25:04.388 --> 25:05.856
I can't do
shit about it.

25:08.159 --> 25:09.593
I ain't shit, man.

25:10.861 --> 25:12.229
It ain't
for nothing, bro.

26:03.447 --> 26:04.849
Where are we
headed now?

26:05.983 --> 26:07.184
Courthouse.

26:07.218 --> 26:09.753
Tayana's filed a petition to
get the police chief dismissed.

26:10.955 --> 26:11.989
Petition.

26:13.157 --> 26:14.391
Sometimes those things work

26:14.425 --> 26:15.993
if enough people
sign them, right?

26:24.735 --> 26:25.970
Where are we now?

26:26.003 --> 26:28.105
At a friend's house.
I gotta pick something up.

26:28.139 --> 26:29.807
You got your license
on you, right?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.008
Yeah, of course.

26:31.041 --> 26:33.010
I need you to drive
for a little bit.

26:33.043 --> 26:34.378
At least till
we get downtown.

26:34.411 --> 26:35.412
Feeling a little off.

26:35.446 --> 26:37.848
Maybe sit in the back
and get some fresh air.

26:37.882 --> 26:40.084
- Yeah. Yeah, I could drive.
- Yeah? You don't mind?

26:40.117 --> 26:41.886
No,
I could drive.

26:41.919 --> 26:43.354
Kai, you can sit in the front
if you want.

26:44.355 --> 26:45.656
Cool.

26:50.327 --> 26:51.195
Really, Kai?

26:51.228 --> 26:53.931
Lazy.

26:53.964 --> 26:56.233
I'm gonna cut.
I need a battery change.

26:56.267 --> 26:57.268
All right.

27:06.911 --> 27:07.912
What time is it?

27:10.748 --> 27:11.749
9:30.

27:13.384 --> 27:15.286
- Call him.
- I already did.

27:17.988 --> 27:19.089
Should we go knock?

27:21.458 --> 27:22.459
Hold on.

27:30.801 --> 27:32.002
Oh, shit.

27:33.304 --> 27:35.139
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

27:35.172 --> 27:37.007
- Don't do this.
- Shut up.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.410
What are you doing?
Linc, what are you doing?

27:39.443 --> 27:42.846
Drive. Drive!

27:42.880 --> 27:44.114
Okay, okay.
Hang in there.

27:47.084 --> 27:49.019
I'm trying to,
but don't wanna get involved.

27:50.854 --> 27:52.189
We should
get out and run.

27:52.223 --> 27:54.225
Run? Are you
fucking kidding me?

27:54.258 --> 27:55.826
They've got fucking
machine guns.

28:00.231 --> 28:02.066
What are you doing?
Put that away!

28:02.099 --> 28:03.968
- What are you doing?
- Put it away.

28:04.868 --> 28:06.337
Stop.

28:06.370 --> 28:08.272
<i>911 what's your emergency?</i>

28:11.442 --> 28:12.443
What are you doing?

28:13.444 --> 28:14.445
Huh?

28:17.848 --> 28:19.383
You want to make
a documentary, right?

28:21.385 --> 28:23.454
Well, now you're
making one.

28:23.487 --> 28:26.190
Hear me when I say this because
I'm only gonna say it once.

28:26.223 --> 28:28.058
Don't stop filming.

28:29.860 --> 28:30.861
Put these on.

28:32.196 --> 28:34.198
Let's go.

28:34.231 --> 28:36.267
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.038
Hold your fire.

29:15.339 --> 29:18.008
I swear, if I hear one
more shot...

29:18.042 --> 29:20.177
Hear one more shot
I'm gonna shoot your captain,

29:20.210 --> 29:22.479
Captain Morris,
in his head.

29:22.513 --> 29:25.382
It's Eugene.
Stop shooting!

29:27.384 --> 29:29.086
Captain.
What the fuck is going on?

29:34.058 --> 29:35.292
Captain?
What do we do?

29:37.662 --> 29:39.029
Stand down.

29:40.164 --> 29:42.132
Our friends
will be outside soon.

29:42.166 --> 29:43.601
They'll get it under control.

29:46.537 --> 29:48.205
This is what
we're gonna do.

29:48.238 --> 29:50.874
You wanna see his head,
I want to see your hands.

29:56.914 --> 29:59.183
Hands. It's okay.
Hands.

30:00.984 --> 30:01.985
Easy.

30:03.655 --> 30:04.855
Hands up.

31:22.399 --> 31:23.400
You remember me?

31:26.437 --> 31:28.172
Put the fucking
phone away.

31:28.205 --> 31:29.206
Put it down.

31:32.777 --> 31:34.945
No, I didn't mean
to shoot your son.

31:37.014 --> 31:38.282
You knew
he was unarmed.

31:40.317 --> 31:43.287
You pointed your gun at him,
and you pulled the trigger.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.155
No, I didn't...

31:45.189 --> 31:46.591
No, I didn't mean
to kill him.

31:52.129 --> 31:53.130
Linc.

31:57.334 --> 31:58.335
You scared?

32:00.772 --> 32:03.675
Are you afraid?

32:13.517 --> 32:15.085
Thinking about
your family, huh?

32:16.520 --> 32:18.055
About how you don't want to die?

32:19.389 --> 32:21.258
About how you're too young?

32:26.463 --> 32:27.665
Answer me, motherfucker.

32:35.172 --> 32:36.340
This won't fix it.

32:39.443 --> 32:40.778
Not this.

32:43.113 --> 32:44.147
It'll make it worse...

32:46.851 --> 32:48.051
For all of us.

33:21.753 --> 33:23.420
Heavily armed men
have stormed

33:23.453 --> 33:25.322
the San Vasillo
Police Department

33:25.355 --> 33:28.525
taking hostage at least
a dozen police officers.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.629
As you can see,
SWAT has arrived and are taking positions

33:31.663 --> 33:35.432
as rampant confusion spreads
surrounding the identity

33:35.465 --> 33:37.802
and motives
of the suspects involved.

33:56.386 --> 33:58.756
Phone ringing like crazy
in there, brother.

33:58.790 --> 34:01.291
Think they're trying to
get you on the line, you know?

34:10.835 --> 34:11.869
Yeah.

34:14.939 --> 34:16.139
I'm in charge.

34:18.610 --> 34:20.410
Lincoln Jefferson.

34:20.444 --> 34:21.879
Father of Kajani Jefferson,

34:21.913 --> 34:24.481
fourteen year old black boy who was
killed by Officer Michael Randall

34:24.514 --> 34:25.717
last year, July 3rd.

34:28.586 --> 34:29.687
Everyone's fine.

34:30.888 --> 34:32.322
I said
everyone's fine.

34:36.828 --> 34:37.862
I want my son.

34:38.763 --> 34:39.998
I want my son.

34:40.031 --> 34:42.767
I want my son! I want my son!
I want my son! I want my son!

34:42.800 --> 34:44.434
You're not hearing me.
You're asking me questions.

34:44.468 --> 34:46.604
You're not hearing me.
You asked me what I want.

34:46.638 --> 34:47.939
I want my son.
Okay?

34:47.972 --> 34:50.207
So call me when
you can bring me that.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.241
All right?

35:22.272 --> 35:23.540
On our way up here
I saw a set of doors

35:23.574 --> 35:24.876
I think they missed.
It might lead outside.

35:24.909 --> 35:27.578
Kai, for the 10th time
they got machine guns.

35:27.612 --> 35:29.212
You saw what they did
out there.

35:29.246 --> 35:30.882
You've said that before.

35:30.915 --> 35:32.583
What are we supposed to do? Just wait in
here until they start executing people?

35:32.617 --> 35:34.217
I don't think
that's what he wants.

35:34.251 --> 35:37.487
Well, we're hostages, and I don't think
he's planning on letting us go anytime.

35:37.521 --> 35:39.757
Well, technically they're
hostages and we're the film crew?

35:39.791 --> 35:41.324
Let's just do
what he says.

35:41.358 --> 35:42.727
Film what he wants us to film.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.861
You're backing up
to the cards?

35:43.895 --> 35:45.797
I just finished
the other two right now.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.700
All right. If you get the WiFi,
just dump it to the cloud. Okay?

35:48.733 --> 35:50.968
Look, if it gets cut off,
we'll figure it out.

35:51.002 --> 35:53.270
What is it with you
and this guy?

35:53.303 --> 35:55.472
What? We're here.
Let's just get it.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.722
- Hey.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

36:12.456 --> 36:13.891
City Hall.

36:15.727 --> 36:18.295
I know what
you're gonna say, but...

36:18.328 --> 36:20.497
<i>Are you okay?</i>

36:20.530 --> 36:23.366
<i>Is anybody hurt? Are you okay?</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:26.403
I'm fine. Everybody's fine.

36:26.436 --> 36:30.307
<i>Okay. Well, it's all over
social media and the news.</i>

36:30.340 --> 36:31.909
<i>They haven't mentioned
your name yet,</i>

36:31.943 --> 36:34.277
<i>but it's just a matter
of time, baby.</i>

36:34.311 --> 36:36.313
<i>If you just...
If you just give up now...</i>

36:36.346 --> 36:37.749
- I'm not.
- <i>Listen.</i>

36:37.782 --> 36:40.651
<i>You are all I have
that connects me to KJ.</i>

36:40.685 --> 36:42.887
Somebody's gotta pay for what
they did to him. All right?

36:42.920 --> 36:44.188
What they did to our son...

36:44.222 --> 36:46.523
- <i>We have to do this peacefully.</i>
- Why we gotta do it peacefully?

36:46.758 --> 36:48.626
Huh?

36:48.659 --> 36:50.728
Why are we the only people
in this country

36:50.762 --> 36:53.664
that are expected to do things
without violence?

36:53.698 --> 36:55.600
You know what white people do
when they're cross?

36:55.633 --> 36:57.602
They kill people.
They don't march.

36:57.635 --> 37:00.470
They don't do protests.
They don't ask for permission.

37:00.504 --> 37:03.775
They don't ask no questions.
They react with force.

37:03.808 --> 37:05.576
I served, I know.

37:05.610 --> 37:08.478
I know how it goes
for everybody except us.

37:08.512 --> 37:10.848
We're the only people expected
to take it on the cheek

37:10.882 --> 37:12.784
and to take it on the other
cheek and walk it off.

37:12.817 --> 37:14.484
<i>Look at me.</i>

37:16.821 --> 37:21.926
<i>You have to stay alive
for me, baby.</i>

37:24.762 --> 37:26.030
<i>He is gone, baby,</i>

37:26.063 --> 37:27.098
<i>Baby, he is gone.</i>

37:27.131 --> 37:28.566
What do you want me to do?

37:28.599 --> 37:32.536
<i>I want you to come back home.
Home, home.</i>

37:36.506 --> 37:38.009
<i>Home, baby. With me.</i>

37:39.376 --> 37:43.648
<i>Okay? We'll just
start over. We'll...</i>

37:43.681 --> 37:46.584
<i>We'll figure it out. We can
work through this together.</i>

37:46.617 --> 37:48.853
<i>Me and you, we can.</i>

37:48.886 --> 37:50.855
<i>Okay?</i>

37:51.789 --> 37:53.891
<i>So just promise me</i>

37:55.492 --> 37:57.460
<i>that you'll make it
through this.</i>

37:58.996 --> 38:01.766
<i>That you will make it
through this</i>

38:01.799 --> 38:04.735
<i>and that you'll stay alive
no matter what, Lincoln.</i>

38:04.769 --> 38:07.004
<i>Promise me that...</i>

38:09.607 --> 38:10.708
Tayana...

38:10.741 --> 38:14.011
<i>Lincoln, it's Steve,
the negotiator.</i>

38:14.045 --> 38:16.914
<i>We shut down the signal
partially to your cell.</i>

38:16.948 --> 38:19.951
<i>You're not gonna get a call
in or out moving forward.</i>

38:19.984 --> 38:22.419
<i>It's not too late
to find a way out of it.</i>

38:24.722 --> 38:29.392
<i>I know you're angry,
like you feel justice wasn't served.</i>

38:29.426 --> 38:32.129
<i>You wanted to try.
You didn't get one.</i>

38:32.163 --> 38:36.167
<i>We can't change that now.
That ship has sailed.</i>

38:36.200 --> 38:38.903
<i>What we can do now
is move forward.</i>

38:45.176 --> 38:48.813
Round everyone up.
Get him right here in the main hall.

38:48.846 --> 38:50.513
Alright, cops first.

38:50.547 --> 38:52.617
We're gonna lock them
to them desks over there.

39:31.889 --> 39:33.658
Those of you
who know why I'm here,

39:34.625 --> 39:36.027
you know what I've lost.

39:37.862 --> 39:40.865
And, you know because of flaws
in our system,

39:40.898 --> 39:42.667
justice was not served.

39:44.969 --> 39:46.536
So today,

39:47.672 --> 39:49.006
today we make that right.

39:52.209 --> 39:54.612
Today, Officer Michael Randall
will be tried

39:54.645 --> 39:56.714
for the murder of my son,
Kajani Jefferson.

39:56.747 --> 39:57.915
- What?
- Absolutely not.

39:57.949 --> 39:59.050
Sit down!

40:08.993 --> 40:12.797
Facts will be presented.
Evidence will be considered,

40:12.830 --> 40:14.231
and a verdict
will be handed down.

40:15.232 --> 40:17.835
Look, the court already spoke...

40:17.868 --> 40:20.204
No, the court spoke for him,
didn't speak for my son.

40:21.906 --> 40:22.974
All right.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.845
How many civilians we got?

40:27.878 --> 40:28.779
Counted six.

40:28.813 --> 40:31.514
Which of you works
processing? Computers?

40:34.251 --> 40:36.087
Cut him loose.
He's coming with us.

41:02.279 --> 41:04.547
If I say your name,
come forward.

41:10.688 --> 41:13.257
- What the fuck?
- Oh, hell no.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.259
- What the fuck is this?
- Calm down.

41:15.292 --> 41:19.330
Are you fucking insane?
You're gonna let these motherfuckers out?

41:19.363 --> 41:21.866
Relax. They're
non-violent offenders.

41:21.899 --> 41:24.068
And trust me, you're gonna
wanna be nice to 'em.

41:29.373 --> 41:31.742
Ah, you lost your fucking mind.

41:33.878 --> 41:36.580
- What do we got?
- We got a janitor.

41:36.614 --> 41:38.749
We got two secretaries.
We got a clerk.

41:38.783 --> 41:42.253
Parking attendant. What is it
that you do here, miss?

41:42.286 --> 41:44.288
I was just here
to pay a parking ticket.

41:44.321 --> 41:46.257
And a responsible young lady.

41:46.290 --> 41:48.826
All right.

41:48.859 --> 41:51.062
Officer Michael Randall,
you're being charged with murder.

41:51.095 --> 41:52.096
Fuck you.

41:53.030 --> 41:55.633
You know you can't charge me.

41:55.666 --> 41:57.768
You want to guess
what the alternative is?

42:04.075 --> 42:05.242
This is your jury.

42:06.077 --> 42:08.712
Look at them.

42:08.746 --> 42:12.249
These are the people that will
be the deciders of your fate.

42:12.283 --> 42:14.852
They will listen to your story,
hear from others

42:14.885 --> 42:18.722
who were involved in the
shooting, and they'll deliberate.

42:18.756 --> 42:22.793
For some reason,
if they find a shadow of a doubt,

42:22.827 --> 42:25.663
you walk out of here a free man,
and I turn myself in.

42:25.696 --> 42:27.331
Yeah. A free man.

42:31.035 --> 42:32.069
This is bullshit.

42:33.737 --> 42:34.772
Captain!

42:42.880 --> 42:44.248
No officers.

42:45.716 --> 42:47.218
Not one officer on the jury.

42:49.453 --> 42:51.222
You know, these aren't my peers.

42:52.423 --> 42:53.958
Welcome to my world.

42:58.229 --> 42:59.997
So I take it,
you're the prosecutor.

43:00.030 --> 43:01.899
I'm the one to speak
for my son. Yeah.

43:02.867 --> 43:04.802
So who defends him?

43:07.438 --> 43:09.206
Sounds like
you already volunteered.

43:11.075 --> 43:13.777
Okay. We'll play your game.
For now.

43:27.258 --> 43:31.028
Okay, um, anyone ever served
on a jury?

43:39.069 --> 43:40.471
I was a foreman.

43:40.504 --> 43:42.940
Okay, good, well,
I need your help

43:42.973 --> 43:46.177
walking the others
through the process. Okay?

43:46.210 --> 43:49.313
Look, I know you didn't ask for
this, and I'm sorry to put it on you,

43:50.915 --> 43:53.918
but the next several hours
will be very important

43:53.951 --> 43:55.920
because at the end of that,
you're gonna have to vote,

43:55.953 --> 43:58.856
and those votes will determine
a man's fate.

43:58.889 --> 44:00.991
You for real, bro?

44:01.025 --> 44:03.894
You gonna let all of us vote
on what happens to a cop?

44:03.928 --> 44:05.196
Think you can be fair?

44:07.031 --> 44:09.500
You know where I'm from, homie?

44:09.533 --> 44:12.770
You know all the shit I've seen
the cops do?

44:12.803 --> 44:15.139
All the shit they done
put me through?

44:19.443 --> 44:20.744
I'll try.

44:22.079 --> 44:24.481
That's good enough.
Anyone else?

44:25.783 --> 44:28.185
What are you gonna do to him

44:28.219 --> 44:30.454
if it's decided
he was in the wrong?

44:36.493 --> 44:37.861
I don't know yet.

44:42.166 --> 44:44.235
Do you all think you can
be fair and impartial,

44:44.268 --> 44:46.237
regardless of the consequences?

44:46.270 --> 44:49.139
The real question,
my brother,

44:49.173 --> 44:52.309
is will you go all the way
with the consequences if we do?

45:10.060 --> 45:11.428
I approached
the driver's side window

45:11.462 --> 45:14.865
and asked the driver for
his license and registration.

45:14.898 --> 45:17.401
He proceeded to pull the
documentation from his glove box

45:17.434 --> 45:21.005
and handed me an insurance card
that I could see was expired.

45:21.038 --> 45:23.307
He asked to look again
for another copy of the card.

45:23.340 --> 45:27.511
But it being dark, I feared for the
safety of myself and my partner.

45:27.544 --> 45:32.116
So I pulled him from the vehicle and attempted
to retrieve the active document myself.

45:32.149 --> 45:34.518
When you previously told
this story and this time too,

45:34.551 --> 45:37.254
you said you were given a card
that was expired,

45:37.288 --> 45:39.390
which I saw gave the idea
to the general public

45:39.423 --> 45:40.858
that the car was uninsured.

45:40.891 --> 45:44.495
Unfortunately, sir, I don't control
what the general public thinks.

45:44.528 --> 45:47.531
But you do remember me saying
repeatedly the car was insured?

45:47.565 --> 45:48.932
Yes. But when...

45:48.966 --> 45:51.869
But you did not give me an
opportunity to re-check the glove box?

45:51.902 --> 45:53.370
No. And I've told you why.

45:54.606 --> 45:58.175
After the shooting, did they
find out the car was insured?

45:58.208 --> 46:00.444
- Yes, I believe they did.
- Was it?

46:02.313 --> 46:03.380
It was.

46:24.068 --> 46:26.403
In your own words, what happened
that night in July?

46:27.905 --> 46:29.306
Start from the beginning.

46:34.411 --> 46:36.947
We were driving south bound
on Virginia Avenue

46:36.980 --> 46:38.882
just after shift change.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.185
Officer Hollander and myself
saw the white Civic

46:41.218 --> 46:43.954
cross the intersection
at an elevated speed.

46:43.987 --> 46:46.990
Upon pulling over the vehicle,

46:47.024 --> 46:49.460
Officer Hollander called in
to request backup.

46:49.493 --> 46:51.295
After directing the car
to the side,

46:51.328 --> 46:54.365
we approached the car
to find two black males.

46:55.332 --> 46:57.334
- You and the deceased.
- Kajani.

46:58.936 --> 46:59.970
That's his name.

47:00.638 --> 47:02.674
Yeah.

47:02.707 --> 47:05.042
- And then we...
- No, you approached the car

47:05.075 --> 47:10.080
to find me and Kajani Jefferson.
Say it with his name.

47:10.914 --> 47:14.918
We approached the car
to find you

47:14.952 --> 47:19.390
and Kajani Jefferson seated in the
driver side and passenger respectively.

47:19.423 --> 47:22.926
- Approached from where?
- The passenger's side.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.128
- Close to Kajani?
- Yes.

47:24.428 --> 47:25.496
Continue.

47:27.398 --> 47:31.402
The driver then provided
an expired insurance card.

47:31.435 --> 47:34.672
There was a small altercation around
whether the car was indeed insured.

47:35.939 --> 47:38.610
It was at that time,
Hollander asked him to exit the car.

47:39.543 --> 47:40.712
And then what?

47:40.745 --> 47:43.380
Hollander proceeded
to search the driver.

47:45.683 --> 47:48.552
When that's when Kajani reached
for something out of my sight.

47:48.586 --> 47:51.623
- You pulled your gun?
- Yes.

47:51.656 --> 47:54.091
You don't know what someone
could have underneath their seat.

47:54.124 --> 47:55.959
Do you remember me
saying repeatedly

47:55.993 --> 47:58.095
<i>can I reached past
my 14-year-old son?</i>

47:58.128 --> 47:59.530
Yes, but a 14...

48:01.999 --> 48:04.168
A 14-year-old could still
be grabbing for a gun.

48:04.201 --> 48:06.336
But it wasn't a gun, was it?

48:06.370 --> 48:09.373
- No, no. It was his phone.
- So you put your gun away?

48:09.406 --> 48:12.109
No, we're taught
not to de-escalate.

48:12.142 --> 48:15.145
No, once a gun is drawn,
it's drawn

48:15.179 --> 48:17.481
- for safety.
- For whose safety?

48:19.183 --> 48:20.384
That's what we're taught.

48:23.755 --> 48:25.122
And then what happened?

48:26.624 --> 48:28.660
He wouldn't stop recording.

48:28.693 --> 48:30.093
And so I pulled him...

48:31.295 --> 48:34.231
Kajani out of the car.

48:34.264 --> 48:36.233
- Put it down!
- I have the right to film.

48:36.266 --> 48:38.168
Exit the car and put your hands
in the air!

48:38.202 --> 48:39.536
- KJ, put the phone down!
- I can film.

48:39.571 --> 48:42.072
- Put the phone down!
- Exit the fucking car!

48:42.105 --> 48:44.475
It's just a cellphone.
Easy. It's just a cellphone.

48:44.508 --> 48:46.109
I need you to put
the phone away.

48:46.143 --> 48:48.178
Put the phone away
and sit on the curb.

48:48.212 --> 48:50.380
- He's unarmed. Okay?
- Just put your phone away.

48:50.414 --> 48:52.349
Put your fucking phone away!

48:52.382 --> 48:54.184
- Hey! Hey!
- Put your fucking phone away!

48:54.218 --> 48:56.086
Get off him!

49:06.263 --> 49:09.601
After the shots, what happened?

49:09.634 --> 49:13.070
No, no, no!

49:23.413 --> 49:25.717
I got in my car
and went to my house.

49:25.750 --> 49:27.017
You went to your house?

49:28.552 --> 49:29.587
That's protocol.

49:30.722 --> 49:34.391
After a shooting,
you go home.

49:34.424 --> 49:36.493
You wait for your superiors
to arrive.

49:47.805 --> 49:50.507
Okay. Okay.

49:52.409 --> 49:55.412
You said the suspect sped
through the intersection.

49:55.445 --> 49:57.582
- Yes.
- You're still saying I was speeding?

49:57.615 --> 49:59.449
- Did you clock him?
- No, we didn't clock him,

49:59.483 --> 50:01.786
but you could tell he was at a
higher speed than what was posted.

50:01.819 --> 50:03.855
If they weren't speeding,
would you have pulled them over?

50:03.888 --> 50:05.355
No.

50:05.389 --> 50:09.594
So if the driver had the proper
insurance card, what would have happened?

50:09.627 --> 50:12.129
We would have let him go.

50:12.162 --> 50:15.633
Kajani Jefferson might
be alive today.

50:15.667 --> 50:19.169
What kind of bullshit
justification is that?

50:19.202 --> 50:22.539
Seriously, since when
do jury members speak?

50:22.574 --> 50:24.642
The only job that they have
is to keep their mouth shut.

50:24.676 --> 50:26.611
Guess what,
you're not in control.

50:26.644 --> 50:30.113
But there's a reason why courts
do things the way they do.

50:30.147 --> 50:31.649
And how is that
working out for us?

50:33.283 --> 50:36.453
Anyone who wants to speak,
feel free to speak.

50:36.486 --> 50:39.189
Throughout this process,
everyone who wants a voice will have one.

50:43.327 --> 50:46.564
Are you allowed to pull someone over for
speeding without knowing their actual speed?

50:46.598 --> 50:49.499
- An officer can use judgment.
- What is that, the law?

50:50.735 --> 50:52.469
Or do you just make it up
as you go?

50:52.502 --> 50:56.139
No, we don't.

50:56.173 --> 50:59.409
You see, nobody knows
what our job is like.

50:59.443 --> 51:02.914
Twenty-four seven,
get the bad guys.

51:02.947 --> 51:06.584
And we can all sit here
and pretend all we want that...

51:07.919 --> 51:11.154
That all the Blacks that get
killed are killed by police,

51:11.188 --> 51:14.324
and that they're all unarmed
and that they're all good people

51:14.358 --> 51:16.460
and that they're all just,
you know...

51:16.493 --> 51:18.730
I don't know, that the cops
are the only ones running around

51:18.763 --> 51:20.732
trying to kill 'em,
but it's not true.

51:20.765 --> 51:22.499
Couldn't be further
from the truth.

51:22.532 --> 51:25.737
Everyone knows the statistics
on Black on Black crime.

51:25.770 --> 51:28.673
How many Blacks are killed
in a year by other Blacks?

51:28.706 --> 51:30.507
They don't put those numbers
in the news.

51:30.540 --> 51:33.611
Do you have the statistics on
whites killing whites in a year?

51:33.645 --> 51:35.046
Or Chinese killing Chinese?

51:35.079 --> 51:37.414
Whites and the Chinese aren't the
ones cramming the prison system.

51:37.447 --> 51:39.549
They're also not the ones
brought over here like property.

51:39.584 --> 51:40.985
Hundreds of years ago.

51:41.019 --> 51:43.353
And what does that have to do with
anything that we're talking about?

51:43.387 --> 51:45.288
You don't find it interesting
that the people

51:45.322 --> 51:46.924
brought over here in chains
are still in chains?

51:46.958 --> 51:50.662
No. No, I don't. Okay?

51:50.695 --> 51:53.196
The slavery thing
is a fucking cop out.

51:53.230 --> 51:55.332
It happened. Get over it.

51:55.365 --> 51:57.367
It ain't my job
to make sense of it.

51:57.401 --> 52:01.405
It's my job... It's our job to
get the bad people off the street.

52:01.438 --> 52:03.273
Black, white, whatever color.

52:03.306 --> 52:06.209
Systematic violence and terror
aimed at one group of people.

52:06.243 --> 52:09.279
And you just said, get over it.
Would you say that about the Holocaust?

52:10.514 --> 52:13.483
Or women's rights?

52:13.517 --> 52:15.687
- It's not the same.
- How is that different?

52:15.720 --> 52:17.822
The things women have
been through in this country,

52:17.855 --> 52:19.924
in the military, on the force.

52:19.957 --> 52:21.491
Are you supporting his side?

52:21.525 --> 52:22.927
I'm supporting my side.

52:22.960 --> 52:26.798
I'm a cop, and I dare anyone in
here to question my loyalty to that.

52:26.831 --> 52:29.934
But I'm also a woman,
a Latina woman at that,

52:29.967 --> 52:33.403
so I know how things in the past
affect things happening now.

52:33.437 --> 52:37.008
I can see that, you know,
for women

52:37.041 --> 52:39.911
and definitely for the Holocaust.
But for them?

52:39.944 --> 52:42.312
Why is it so hard for you
to empathize with Black people?

52:42.345 --> 52:44.548
Because you guys make it hard.

52:44.582 --> 52:46.818
That's more of that racist shit
right there.

52:46.851 --> 52:48.720
No, that.

52:48.753 --> 52:51.989
That's the fucking problem.
That's the problem in this country.

52:52.023 --> 52:55.860
Anytime someone speaks the
truth, they're labeled a racist.

52:55.893 --> 52:59.296
Let me tell you something.
The KKK is racist.

52:59.329 --> 53:00.965
Nazis are racist.

53:00.998 --> 53:05.502
So the only people that could be racist
are those that are in the KKK or the Nazis?

53:05.535 --> 53:08.940
Anybody else? Anybody else by default
is cool is what you're saying.

53:08.973 --> 53:13.343
I mean, like, fuck. Even right now,
I feel like I might say the wrong thing.

53:13.376 --> 53:17.347
And I'm not racist. I know that.
I don't see color.

53:17.380 --> 53:18.916
You color blind?

53:18.950 --> 53:20.017
You know what I mean.

53:20.051 --> 53:21.551
You said you're color blind.

53:21.586 --> 53:25.890
I mean, I don't treat people differently
based on the color of their skin.

53:25.923 --> 53:27.892
Any one of these guys
will tell you that.

53:27.925 --> 53:29.927
I've had partners of all colors.

53:29.961 --> 53:34.464
And, you know, frankly,
I haven't met many racist cops.

53:34.498 --> 53:38.603
- We have a black captain, for Christ sakes.
- Meaning what?

53:38.636 --> 53:42.405
Meaning that it's fucking
impossible for us to be racist.

53:42.439 --> 53:45.042
Impossible. That's like saying
it's impossible to be sexist

53:45.076 --> 53:47.544
'cause you're married
to a woman.

53:47.578 --> 53:49.947
Programming is programming.

53:49.981 --> 53:53.017
When a person buys
into a system or a culture

53:53.050 --> 53:55.385
that teaches that racism,
that dominance,

53:55.418 --> 53:57.688
that person, if they Black,
they white, Chinese...

53:57.722 --> 53:59.056
- Oh, come on.
- ...whatever color they are,

53:59.090 --> 54:01.458
they proudly reflect
that culture in every situation.

54:01.491 --> 54:03.460
So, what you're saying
is that it's possible

54:03.493 --> 54:06.329
for a black cop to be racist
towards another black,

54:06.363 --> 54:09.033
to target him,
or shoot him based on a bias.

54:09.066 --> 54:10.935
Hell, yeah,
he'll probably shoot him twice.

54:10.968 --> 54:14.471
That's bullshit.
Come on, you guys, you...

54:17.909 --> 54:19.342
Fuck, never mind.

54:19.376 --> 54:21.444
No, Go on.
Say your piece.

54:22.947 --> 54:26.918
I'm just saying,
you guys wanna cry race?

54:26.951 --> 54:29.854
But a lot of the things that
black people have to deal with

54:29.887 --> 54:32.023
is based on the way
black people act.

54:33.024 --> 54:34.491
Look at hip hop music.

54:34.524 --> 54:35.693
What is it? Uh...

54:35.726 --> 54:38.563
"Drug the hoe, get the hoe,
shoot the bitch, do the..."

54:38.596 --> 54:40.932
Whatever the fuck.
What do you expect?

54:42.033 --> 54:43.801
And you think
I want my daughter

54:43.835 --> 54:46.137
to hang around with people
that think that way?

54:46.170 --> 54:48.471
I mean, let alone
come to my house. Hell, no!

54:48.505 --> 54:51.474
But you let your kids
listen to it and buy it, right?

54:51.508 --> 54:54.444
Those are the dollars
that keep it getting made.

54:54.477 --> 54:59.116
White people buy the music that
blacks pay for with our lives.

54:59.150 --> 55:01.886
The black kids think
they have to live that life

55:01.919 --> 55:06.023
to make the music,
so your daughter can go buy it.

55:06.057 --> 55:09.459
It's a cycle. It happens
again and again and again.

55:09.492 --> 55:11.062
What are you saying?
This is our fault?

55:11.095 --> 55:12.096
He's making a point.

55:13.463 --> 55:15.666
No matter how bullshit
the music is,

55:15.700 --> 55:18.669
y'all appropriate it,
fetishize it.

55:18.703 --> 55:21.005
The demand rises,
the profits rise,

55:21.038 --> 55:22.306
the sales rise.

55:22.340 --> 55:25.176
Then it's just blacks and
Latinos exploited for the supply.

55:25.209 --> 55:26.543
Man...

55:26.577 --> 55:29.046
You all just reach
and reach.

55:29.080 --> 55:32.783
Or maybe Blacks and Latinos
aren't all victims.

55:33.918 --> 55:35.820
Maybe they are
the actual thugs

55:35.853 --> 55:37.955
that they're saying they are
in their music.

55:46.864 --> 55:48.799
Nah. You don't
know me, homie.

55:48.833 --> 55:50.400
You don't know anything
about me, bro.

55:59.243 --> 56:02.580
I'm crushing my people?
I'm crushing my people,

56:02.613 --> 56:04.882
you fucking cartel wannabe!

56:04.916 --> 56:08.085
Huh? You think you know me?
You think you know me?

56:08.119 --> 56:11.421
You think you know
anything about me? Huh?

56:12.156 --> 56:13.624
Fucking, your gang tattoos.

56:13.658 --> 56:16.227
You think you're all
fucking hard, huh?

56:16.260 --> 56:19.196
Killing, pushing drugs,
selling little girls.

56:19.230 --> 56:21.933
And you think you're fucking
better than me?

56:21.966 --> 56:24.201
No, dawg,
You don't know me, homie.

56:24.235 --> 56:25.937
You don't know shit
about me, huh?

56:27.171 --> 56:29.807
Fucking, you make it
impossible

56:29.840 --> 56:31.776
for fucking Hispanic
or Latino people

56:31.809 --> 56:33.510
to get ahead
in this fucking country,

56:33.543 --> 56:34.612
'cause all they see is you,

56:35.646 --> 56:36.914
and your fucking tattoos,

56:36.948 --> 56:38.816
and your fucking
gangster shit.

56:51.996 --> 56:52.997
Fuck you.

57:00.705 --> 57:02.106
Kind of proves my point.

57:03.574 --> 57:05.710
Two Hispanic guys arguing.
It's heated.

57:05.743 --> 57:07.678
But is it racial? No.

57:07.712 --> 57:09.780
Black guys, white guys,
Hispanic guys.

57:09.814 --> 57:11.749
The thing that separates us
isn't race.

57:12.650 --> 57:15.086
It's class, it's education.

57:15.119 --> 57:16.120
You have kids?

57:17.121 --> 57:18.155
Yeah, I got two girls.

57:18.189 --> 57:19.156
They go to public school?

57:19.190 --> 57:22.093
No. I work my ass off
so they don't have to.

57:22.126 --> 57:25.796
Why? Why not public school?
What's wrong with that?

57:25.830 --> 57:27.231
I mean, if all a person
has to do

57:27.264 --> 57:28.699
is get an education,

57:28.733 --> 57:30.568
then why does it matter
where they get it?

57:32.737 --> 57:34.171
You know why.

57:34.205 --> 57:36.607
Because private schools
are built like colleges.

57:36.640 --> 57:37.742
And public schools,

57:37.775 --> 57:39.310
where little brown
and black kids are,

57:39.343 --> 57:41.012
they're built like prisons.

57:41.045 --> 57:42.246
So, it's no surprise

57:42.279 --> 57:43.781
when private school kids
go to college.

57:43.814 --> 57:45.249
And public schools,
like where I grew up,

57:45.282 --> 57:46.717
they don't even
graduate kids

57:46.751 --> 57:47.885
on their way
to locking them up.

57:47.918 --> 57:50.554
And that is a race problem,

57:50.955 --> 57:52.857
Officer.

57:52.890 --> 57:55.092
But that's America, right?

57:56.227 --> 57:57.228
We don't fix the system,

57:57.261 --> 57:59.130
just put a premium
on the way to get around it.

57:59.163 --> 58:01.565
You think only black people
have to deal with that?

58:01.599 --> 58:05.302
No. We just sit in the
worst position to beat it.

58:05.336 --> 58:08.039
Which is why I sacrificed
everything I had

58:08.072 --> 58:09.940
to put my son
in a better position.

58:09.974 --> 58:11.108
Taking him out
of where he was,

58:11.142 --> 58:13.611
and putting him into a place
where he could survive.

58:13.644 --> 58:15.079
Well, guess what?
It wasn't enough.

58:15.846 --> 58:17.114
I couldn't save him.

58:17.148 --> 58:18.883
I couldn't save my boy,
not from him.

58:20.351 --> 58:22.119
And why couldn't he
have just complied?

58:23.687 --> 58:25.723
None of you ever comply.

58:25.756 --> 58:27.224
'Cause we're fucking tired!

58:27.258 --> 58:29.226
We're tired of being stalked
and intimidated

58:29.260 --> 58:31.328
and getting our asses kicked
whenever you feel like it.

58:31.362 --> 58:33.297
That attitude
is why that shit happens.

58:34.732 --> 58:37.968
If you all just took
a second to think,

58:38.002 --> 58:39.837
then maybe you'd avoid
all that shit.

58:39.870 --> 58:41.372
If all of you
took a second to think,

58:41.405 --> 58:42.873
maybe you wouldn't kill
so many of us.

58:42.907 --> 58:44.208
I didn't mean
to kill your son.

58:44.241 --> 58:46.744
- But you did.
- I did what I was trained to do.

58:48.245 --> 58:51.015
There was a threat.
And I was... I was scared.

58:53.417 --> 58:56.954
Which we're trained.
We're trained to go home. That's the...

58:56.987 --> 59:00.157
I have a kid at home, too.

59:00.191 --> 59:03.027
Whatever, I am a human being,
just like anybody else.

59:03.961 --> 59:06.130
You know, every, every day,
I, I go to work,

59:06.163 --> 59:08.265
and I want to go home
to my kids.

59:08.299 --> 59:10.034
I want to see my son.

59:13.003 --> 59:15.106
I had a split second
to decide

59:15.139 --> 59:17.775
whether you were going
to attack my partner

59:17.808 --> 59:19.877
or your kid
was gonna reach for his gun.

59:19.910 --> 59:22.046
I didn't wanna get shot.
I wanted to go home.

59:22.079 --> 59:23.681
We wanted to go home, too.

59:37.294 --> 59:38.295
This is my son.

59:40.865 --> 59:41.866
This is my little boy.

59:48.139 --> 59:50.040
This is what was
taken from me.

59:52.276 --> 59:56.180
He didn't ask to be born.
He didn't ask to be black.

59:56.213 --> 59:57.681
And he didn't ask
to get shot.

59:59.183 --> 1:00:01.085
Look at him. Look at him!

1:00:07.391 --> 1:00:09.293
I'm never gonna be able
to hug my son again.

1:00:12.296 --> 1:00:14.832
Never gonna see him get
married or have children.

1:00:21.005 --> 1:00:22.373
Officer Randall
took that from me.

1:00:23.908 --> 1:00:25.376
The world
took that from me.

1:00:26.443 --> 1:00:27.444
I just want justice.

1:00:28.179 --> 1:00:29.180
That's all I want.

1:00:30.915 --> 1:00:33.250
I just want justice.
He took it from me.

1:00:33.284 --> 1:00:35.986
But you,
you can give it back.

1:00:36.020 --> 1:00:38.989
Why can't you
just accept responsibility,

1:00:39.023 --> 1:00:42.726
that you put your son
in that situation

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:43.894
by breaking the law

1:00:43.928 --> 1:00:45.462
and going over
the posted speed limit.

1:00:45.496 --> 1:00:46.864
What speed were we going?

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.868
The speed.
What speed were we going?

1:00:50.901 --> 1:00:52.836
You pulled us over 'cause
we were speeding, right?

1:00:52.870 --> 1:00:55.005
What speed were we going
when you pulled us over?

1:00:55.039 --> 1:00:56.340
It was over a year ago.

1:00:56.373 --> 1:00:57.341
You want me to remind...

1:00:57.374 --> 1:00:59.310
We'll get the report.
Get the report, Derwood.

1:00:59.343 --> 1:01:00.778
It's not in the report.

1:01:00.811 --> 1:01:02.313
- Why not?
- Because I didn't record it.

1:01:04.949 --> 1:01:07.084
I registered it
based on what I remember.

1:01:07.117 --> 1:01:09.253
Okay, what did you see?
What was the speed?

1:01:09.286 --> 1:01:12.957
I mean, it's residential,
so it's 25 miles-per-hour, right?

1:01:12.990 --> 1:01:14.425
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:17.261
You were there, right?
Same car, same time.

1:01:17.294 --> 1:01:19.363
What was the speed?
What? 45, 50?

1:01:20.097 --> 1:01:21.432
Forty-five, 50,
seems right.

1:01:21.465 --> 1:01:22.499
Yeah. You sure?

1:01:22.533 --> 1:01:24.301
Not exactly, no.
I don't remember.

1:01:24.335 --> 1:01:25.436
Well, I do remember.

1:01:25.469 --> 1:01:27.238
I do remember,
'cause I was there, too.

1:01:27.271 --> 1:01:30.507
I've played it over
a thousand times in my mind,

1:01:30.541 --> 1:01:32.276
trying to think about
all the reasons

1:01:32.309 --> 1:01:34.044
why this thing went wrong.

1:01:34.078 --> 1:01:35.246
We were crossing Virginia

1:01:35.279 --> 1:01:36.880
at Lombardi,
residential area.

1:01:36.914 --> 1:01:38.449
Twenty-five miles-
per-hour posted.

1:01:38.482 --> 1:01:40.517
Which is why 45
would have seemed very...

1:01:40.551 --> 1:01:42.419
Not when there's
speed bumps 20 feet apart

1:01:42.453 --> 1:01:44.154
on each side
of the intersection.

1:01:45.456 --> 1:01:47.891
We were not speeding up,
were we, Officer Randall?

1:01:47.925 --> 1:01:50.160
We were slowing down.

1:01:50.194 --> 1:01:52.896
Just long enough
for you to see two black men

1:01:52.930 --> 1:01:55.165
driving through that
prestigious neighborhood.

1:01:55.199 --> 1:01:56.333
Race has
nothing to do with it.

1:01:56.367 --> 1:01:58.369
Are you standing by your
story that we were speeding?

1:01:58.402 --> 1:02:00.004
- It's an officer's...
- Officer Randall!

1:02:00.037 --> 1:02:01.405
Are you standing by your story

1:02:01.438 --> 1:02:02.473
that we were speeding?

1:02:02.506 --> 1:02:03.874
What do you expect?

1:02:05.476 --> 1:02:07.511
You were driving
in that neighborhood

1:02:07.544 --> 1:02:11.115
in that crappy car,
which is suspicious.

1:02:11.148 --> 1:02:12.816
You went there
after 12:00 midnight.

1:02:12.850 --> 1:02:15.853
Who's driving around in that
neighborhood after midnight?

1:02:17.254 --> 1:02:20.124
People are coming home, yes.

1:02:21.058 --> 1:02:22.092
But most of the people

1:02:22.126 --> 1:02:23.527
driving around
in that situation

1:02:23.561 --> 1:02:26.497
are bad people,
looking to do bad things.

1:02:26.530 --> 1:02:28.966
- So you profiled us.
- You are damn right I did.

1:02:35.239 --> 1:02:36.974
Like, you get pissed off

1:02:37.007 --> 1:02:39.343
if your car gets
broken into, right?

1:02:39.376 --> 1:02:41.512
You get pissed off if your
house gets burglarized.

1:02:41.545 --> 1:02:44.381
But how are we supposed
to find those bad people

1:02:44.415 --> 1:02:46.584
if we're not
pulling people over?

1:02:46.618 --> 1:02:49.153
The only way
to find these bad people

1:02:49.186 --> 1:02:50.988
is by pulling them over.

1:02:51.021 --> 1:02:54.425
We pull them over, we see
burglary tools, stolen mail.

1:02:54.458 --> 1:02:56.527
Worse, nine times
out of ten,

1:02:56.561 --> 1:02:58.462
see, in that situation,
something's up.

1:02:59.997 --> 1:03:02.066
Do you want to be...
Do you want to be safe?

1:03:03.334 --> 1:03:05.269
You want to be kept safe?
We keep you safe.

1:03:07.905 --> 1:03:08.906
That's the cost.

1:03:13.310 --> 1:03:14.579
And there it is.

1:03:14.612 --> 1:03:18.482
So, if the officers didn't
profile that man and his son...

1:03:18.515 --> 1:03:20.652
That man and his son
make it home at night.

1:03:20.685 --> 1:03:23.153
And Kajani Jefferson
might be alive today.

1:03:58.489 --> 1:04:00.324
No, no... Get down, get down!

1:04:02.594 --> 1:04:04.495
Get down.

1:04:04.528 --> 1:04:07.164
Come on, bitch.
You're the guy that took me in,

1:04:07.197 --> 1:04:09.099
following me
with your fake ass charge.

1:04:09.133 --> 1:04:11.168
Fuck you, you gangster
fucking piece of shit!

1:04:11.201 --> 1:04:12.169
Fuck you, bitch.

1:04:12.202 --> 1:04:14.104
You fucking talk shit
and you get a beating!

1:04:14.138 --> 1:04:15.406
Come on.
Come on, fight me.

1:04:15.439 --> 1:04:17.541
Settle down.
Settle down, man.

1:04:17.575 --> 1:04:18.676
Get him back
to his cell.

1:04:18.710 --> 1:04:20.043
All right,
let me help you up.

1:04:20.077 --> 1:04:22.112
Yeah, okay.

1:04:22.146 --> 1:04:23.947
Let me help, come on.

1:04:24.481 --> 1:04:25.549
No, wait!

1:04:27.585 --> 1:04:28.952
- Come on, now.
- Fuck!

1:04:30.354 --> 1:04:32.022
Get the fuck off me!

1:04:32.055 --> 1:04:33.056
Get off me!

1:04:34.224 --> 1:04:35.627
Linc.

1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:36.661
Oh, shit.

1:04:37.461 --> 1:04:38.630
- Stay down.
- Shit.

1:04:40.698 --> 1:04:41.699
You all right?

1:04:45.235 --> 1:04:47.471
Hey, hey, hey.

1:04:48.238 --> 1:04:49.239
Sit down.

1:04:51.275 --> 1:04:52.376
Come over here, sit down.

1:04:54.077 --> 1:04:55.479
You all right?

1:04:55.512 --> 1:04:58.549
Ugh, better than
all right, nephew.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:04:59.751
Yeah, it went through.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:03.287
- We gotta get him outta here.
- Yeah.

1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:04.656
No, it's not gonna happen.

1:05:04.689 --> 1:05:06.490
All I gotta do
is call.

1:05:06.523 --> 1:05:08.158
Look, Uncle, listen to me.

1:05:08.192 --> 1:05:10.394
If it hit an artery or
something, we can't stop it.

1:05:10.427 --> 1:05:12.262
Don't matter
what happen to me.

1:05:13.765 --> 1:05:16.668
I'm old. I've been around
a long time.

1:05:17.434 --> 1:05:18.535
And because of you,

1:05:20.772 --> 1:05:21.972
I get to live.

1:05:23.775 --> 1:05:26.143
So, hell no,
I ain't going nowhere.

1:05:28.345 --> 1:05:29.980
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

1:05:32.483 --> 1:05:34.686
Go on, get back to it.

1:05:34.719 --> 1:05:36.487
I got him, Linc.
I got him.

1:05:42.627 --> 1:05:43.628
Lincoln.

1:05:45.195 --> 1:05:46.330
You need to end this.

1:05:47.732 --> 1:05:49.066
Nothing good
is gonna come

1:05:49.099 --> 1:05:51.068
out of what
you're doing here.

1:05:51.101 --> 1:05:53.036
You've imprisoned cops,

1:05:53.070 --> 1:05:55.506
and allowed them
to be attacked by inmates.

1:05:55.539 --> 1:05:57.374
You've taken
civilians hostage.

1:05:57.407 --> 1:05:59.309
You've got
an injured comrade,

1:05:59.343 --> 1:06:01.679
and you've got World War III
outside.

1:06:01.713 --> 1:06:04.448
On top of all that,
your experiment is done.

1:06:05.850 --> 1:06:08.252
Your 12th juror is gone...

1:06:08.285 --> 1:06:11.455
So turn it in,
so no one else gets hurt.

1:06:13.390 --> 1:06:14.726
I think he's right.

1:06:29.473 --> 1:06:30.675
Jordin. You're up.

1:06:30.708 --> 1:06:32.810
- What?
- You're the 12th Juror. Come on.

1:06:32.844 --> 1:06:34.679
- No, Linc. I can't...
- I'm not asking.

1:06:37.214 --> 1:06:38.215
He's biased.

1:06:38.883 --> 1:06:40.150
I'm not biased.

1:06:40.183 --> 1:06:41.351
This is a bad move, Linc.

1:06:41.385 --> 1:06:42.787
We're moving
this thing forward.

1:06:44.488 --> 1:06:45.489
Vote your conscience.

1:06:47.892 --> 1:06:49.526
Take as much time
as you need.

1:07:06.678 --> 1:07:07.511
Are you okay?

1:07:07.544 --> 1:07:10.380
I don't wanna be
in the middle of this.

1:07:10.414 --> 1:07:12.382
None of us do.
But we're here now,

1:07:13.350 --> 1:07:14.284
and it's like he said.

1:07:14.318 --> 1:07:16.320
Whatever happens,
just vote your conscience.

1:07:24.662 --> 1:07:25.697
Hey, kid...

1:07:28.833 --> 1:07:30.467
Just remember
what's at stake here.

1:07:52.189 --> 1:07:53.190
So, guilty.

1:08:00.397 --> 1:08:01.699
And not guilty.

1:08:06.336 --> 1:08:08.271
Well, it's all or nothing.

1:08:08.806 --> 1:08:10.207
Maybe we don't vote.

1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:14.277
Will you be the one to go out there
and tell him we're gonna refuse.

1:08:14.311 --> 1:08:17.547
We have to treat this
like we would if we were outside.

1:08:17.582 --> 1:08:19.584
We rehash the facts,

1:08:19.617 --> 1:08:21.551
determine if he broke the law.

1:08:21.586 --> 1:08:23.588
He broke the law
when he profiled.

1:08:23.621 --> 1:08:25.623
That doesn't mean
he planned to kill that kid.

1:08:25.657 --> 1:08:27.290
It doesn't have to,

1:08:27.324 --> 1:08:28.960
by his own words,
it's plain and simple,

1:08:28.993 --> 1:08:30.662
He should have never
been in that position.

1:08:30.695 --> 1:08:33.530
It's not plain.
It's not simple.

1:08:33.564 --> 1:08:35.232
It's a police officer's life,

1:08:35.265 --> 1:08:37.568
his family, his reputation.

1:08:37.602 --> 1:08:40.170
Reputation.
Are you serious right now?

1:08:41.338 --> 1:08:43.675
Talking about
fucking reputation?

1:08:43.708 --> 1:08:45.943
It's funny how you wanna
talk about reputation now.

1:08:45.977 --> 1:08:47.612
They don't talk
about reputation

1:08:47.645 --> 1:08:49.847
when they sending Blacks
and Latinos away for life.

1:08:49.881 --> 1:08:51.849
All right, we need
to stay productive, here.

1:08:52.750 --> 1:08:55.419
You just need
to stay on point, okay?

1:08:55.452 --> 1:08:58.255
And let's be clear,
we're not sentencing him.

1:08:58.288 --> 1:09:00.357
We're just determining guilt.

1:09:00.390 --> 1:09:03.828
Now, why do you think
he is not guilty?

1:09:03.861 --> 1:09:06.496
Pulling someone over
is the most dangerous action

1:09:06.530 --> 1:09:08.365
a cop does on a daily basis.

1:09:08.398 --> 1:09:09.734
That's just dangerous.

1:09:09.767 --> 1:09:10.968
So you'll
be blind to the fact

1:09:11.002 --> 1:09:13.604
that it became dangerous
because he thought he was black?

1:09:13.638 --> 1:09:15.272
Are we here to
determine if the cop broke the law?

1:09:15.305 --> 1:09:16.841
We're here
to find the truth, homeboy.

1:09:16.874 --> 1:09:18.341
We're here to find
the truth.

1:09:30.555 --> 1:09:31.556
You good?

1:09:37.427 --> 1:09:39.496
Yeah, I'm all right.

1:09:41.331 --> 1:09:42.332
You?

1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:44.401
I'm cool.

1:09:45.970 --> 1:09:47.404
Well, this needs
closure, man.

1:09:48.673 --> 1:09:49.674
We'll get it.

1:09:51.642 --> 1:09:52.643
One way or another.

1:09:56.848 --> 1:09:59.784
I still don't know why they
let him leave the crime scene.

1:09:59.817 --> 1:10:01.953
Doesn't everyone else have to
make a statement right away?

1:10:01.986 --> 1:10:05.322
- Right?
- He was getting the story straight.

1:10:05.355 --> 1:10:07.825
Or maybe
just to get him away

1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:09.994
to help him calm down.

1:10:11.596 --> 1:10:14.999
Killing a kid
must be traumatizing.

1:10:15.032 --> 1:10:17.635
But seeing your child killed
has to be traumatic, too.

1:10:20.638 --> 1:10:22.607
You have thoughts, Jordin?

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:25.843
I mean, I'm not sure
we're gonna get anywhere

1:10:25.877 --> 1:10:27.344
if everyone
doesn't contribute

1:10:27.377 --> 1:10:28.579
and add something here.

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:38.856
I grew up middle class.

1:10:40.625 --> 1:10:42.960
I actually have an uncle
who was a cop,

1:10:44.796 --> 1:10:47.464
and, I believe, a good man.

1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:49.901
So, um...

1:10:52.770 --> 1:10:56.007
I've been
a little conflicted.

1:10:57.942 --> 1:11:02.680
It's hard for me to believe
that all cops are bad.

1:11:02.713 --> 1:11:06.017
Do I think that police have
a dangerous job? Of course.

1:11:07.384 --> 1:11:08.920
Do I think
that Officer Randall

1:11:08.953 --> 1:11:10.621
woke up that morning

1:11:10.655 --> 1:11:14.959
thinking about killing
someone's kid? No.

1:11:14.992 --> 1:11:17.895
Can I say,
without a shadow of a doubt,

1:11:17.929 --> 1:11:20.397
that race was
the driving force around

1:11:20.430 --> 1:11:22.432
Kajani Jefferson
being killed?

1:11:25.402 --> 1:11:26.469
I don't know.

1:11:28.105 --> 1:11:29.807
I look around this precinct

1:11:31.776 --> 1:11:35.713
and I see stickers
and banners that say,

1:11:35.746 --> 1:11:41.052
"Back the blue"
and "Support our police."

1:11:41.085 --> 1:11:44.789
Things left over from the
backlash of Kajani getting killed.

1:11:46.523 --> 1:11:48.458
But I haven't seen
anything acknowledging

1:11:48.491 --> 1:11:52.429
that a kid lost his life.

1:11:52.462 --> 1:11:57.068
A citizen who was expected
to be a patriot.

1:11:57.101 --> 1:11:59.971
How can anyone
who has this...

1:12:00.004 --> 1:12:03.774
This history of pain
and poverty

1:12:03.808 --> 1:12:06.978
and subjugation
be expected to be

1:12:07.011 --> 1:12:09.847
a patriot, proud to be
an American,

1:12:11.816 --> 1:12:15.586
only to be shot down because
of their American skin?

1:12:17.555 --> 1:12:20.558
And how could anyone patriotic
ignore these killings

1:12:20.591 --> 1:12:24.629
and yet pride themselves on
being a part of a great nation?

1:12:24.662 --> 1:12:28.465
Great nations aren't great
because they oppress,

1:12:28.498 --> 1:12:31.569
but because they liberate,

1:12:31.602 --> 1:12:34.672
not because they kill,
but because they heal.

1:12:34.705 --> 1:12:36.908
Police and soldiers

1:12:36.941 --> 1:12:39.542
should be the
gatekeepers of that truth

1:12:39.577 --> 1:12:42.146
and should protect it
with their lives.

1:12:45.750 --> 1:12:48.085
Fuck, man,
this fucking sucks.

1:12:49.921 --> 1:12:52.590
This really actually
fucking sucks.

1:12:52.623 --> 1:12:55.693
It sucks. People are dying.
Kids are dying.

1:12:55.726 --> 1:12:58.596
I don't wanna hear another
story of a black kid

1:12:58.629 --> 1:13:00.164
killed by a cop.

1:13:00.197 --> 1:13:02.700
Yeah, I don't wanna
hear how

1:13:02.733 --> 1:13:04.602
the cop did the right thing

1:13:04.635 --> 1:13:07.071
no matter the circumstances,

1:13:07.104 --> 1:13:10.174
and I don't wanna have to
see another mother and father

1:13:10.207 --> 1:13:14.544
just grieving and powerless
and pushed to the point with...

1:13:17.048 --> 1:13:19.951
Where they're willing
to give their own lives.

1:13:19.984 --> 1:13:22.753
So if it means us

1:13:24.622 --> 1:13:25.957
doing the right thing

1:13:25.990 --> 1:13:28.826
will make this man
have to suffer.

1:13:28.859 --> 1:13:33.831
If it means us having
to hold him accountable

1:13:33.864 --> 1:13:36.600
so that police
everywhere would just

1:13:36.634 --> 1:13:38.703
take a beat

1:13:38.736 --> 1:13:40.972
before they
make his mistake...

1:13:44.842 --> 1:13:46.509
then so be it.

1:14:19.677 --> 1:14:20.845
They're ready, nephew.

1:14:38.195 --> 1:14:40.664
Officer Michael Randall

1:14:40.698 --> 1:14:42.800
in the murder
of Kajani Jefferson,

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:44.835
we, the jury, find you...

1:14:47.104 --> 1:14:48.873
guilty.

1:14:50.908 --> 1:14:52.676
What does that mean?

1:14:52.710 --> 1:14:54.578
What does that mean?

1:14:54.612 --> 1:14:56.180
- What did you do, huh?
- Hey, hey!

1:14:56.881 --> 1:14:59.583
What did you do?

1:14:59.617 --> 1:15:01.551
- Don't, don't do this.
- What are you doing?

1:15:09.794 --> 1:15:10.961
On his knees.

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:23.874
Is this yours?

1:15:24.975 --> 1:15:26.110
Yes.

1:15:27.812 --> 1:15:29.080
Call your wife and kid.

1:15:31.215 --> 1:15:32.616
Call them

1:15:33.017 --> 1:15:34.051
on video.

1:15:50.067 --> 1:15:51.969
<i>My, God. Thank God.</i>

1:15:52.002 --> 1:15:54.905
- Yeah, baby.
- <i>Honey.</i>

1:15:54.939 --> 1:15:58.809
<i>Are you okay? You coming out?
Is everything okay?</i>

1:15:58.843 --> 1:16:01.212
No, I don't think
I'm coming out.

1:16:01.245 --> 1:16:04.081
<i>What's going on, baby?
What's going on?</i>

1:16:04.115 --> 1:16:05.783
<i>I've got someone here
who wants to talk to you.</i>

1:16:05.816 --> 1:16:07.084
<i>He's taking
the phone from me.</i>

1:16:07.985 --> 1:16:09.086
<i>Dad.</i>

1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:11.422
Hey, buddy.

1:16:11.455 --> 1:16:12.890
Are you okay?

1:16:12.923 --> 1:16:15.159
<i>I'm good.
Your picture's on TV.</i>

1:16:15.192 --> 1:16:16.727
<i>When are you
coming home?</i>

1:16:18.262 --> 1:16:19.663
You know I...

1:16:19.697 --> 1:16:20.931
I love you, kid.

1:16:22.766 --> 1:16:25.736
All right. You gotta...
You take care of your mom.

1:16:27.004 --> 1:16:29.273
<i>Mike, Mike, you're scaring him.
What's going on?</i>

1:16:30.808 --> 1:16:32.276
I'm not gonna
make it out of it.

1:16:32.309 --> 1:16:34.778
<i>What? What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1:16:34.812 --> 1:16:36.013
<i>Don't talk like that.</i>

1:16:36.046 --> 1:16:37.748
You know,
I made a mistake,

1:16:37.781 --> 1:16:39.250
and, uh...

1:16:39.283 --> 1:16:41.051
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Mike, listen to me.</i>

1:16:41.085 --> 1:16:42.720
<i>I'm coming, okay?</i>

1:16:42.753 --> 1:16:43.988
<i>In two seconds, right now.</i>

1:16:44.021 --> 1:16:45.256
I... I love you.

1:16:45.289 --> 1:16:46.524
<i>I'm gonna get Jason.
I'm gonna come to you right now.</i>

1:16:46.558 --> 1:16:48.159
- I love you so much.
- <i>I'm gonna come to you right now.</i>

1:16:48.192 --> 1:16:49.793
<i>Look...</i>

1:17:40.277 --> 1:17:42.046
That indescribable feeling

1:17:42.079 --> 1:17:44.048
I've been carrying the
last year and a half.

1:17:47.218 --> 1:17:48.452
Now you know.

1:17:49.453 --> 1:17:52.156
I'm sorry.

1:17:53.924 --> 1:17:56.060
I'm so sorry.

1:18:57.154 --> 1:18:58.289
That's it?

1:18:58.322 --> 1:18:59.890
Yup.

1:19:03.027 --> 1:19:04.328
I did what I came to do.

1:19:05.529 --> 1:19:07.231
I'll take it all the way
if they let me

1:19:07.264 --> 1:19:09.366
serve whatever time
they throw at me.

1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:11.902
Well, at least no cops died.

1:19:11.935 --> 1:19:13.203
That's the miracle, right?

1:19:13.937 --> 1:19:15.039
That was the plan.

1:19:16.140 --> 1:19:17.875
How did you know
they would convict?

1:19:19.176 --> 1:19:20.277
I didn't.

1:19:21.512 --> 1:19:23.113
So all of this

1:19:24.281 --> 1:19:25.816
was to make the cops see?

1:19:27.017 --> 1:19:28.419
No.

1:19:28.452 --> 1:19:30.054
Just to make the world see.

1:19:39.330 --> 1:19:41.131
That's why you're here.

1:21:00.344 --> 1:21:02.045
I'll see you
on the other side.

1:21:11.589 --> 1:21:14.425
You know for the first
time in my life, I feel like

1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:18.563
I'm the one
questioning everything.

1:21:26.136 --> 1:21:28.972
You know, if it's okay,

1:21:30.374 --> 1:21:32.242
I'd like to
walk out with you.

1:21:36.113 --> 1:21:37.715
Not as an enemy.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.261
You might want to put that down?

1:22:40.612 --> 1:22:42.546
This is Officer Mike Randall.

1:22:42.580 --> 1:22:45.115
I'm walking out with Lincoln Jefferson.
He's unarmed.

1:22:45.148 --> 1:22:46.283
I repeat, he's unarmed!

1:22:49.353 --> 1:22:51.088
Linc! Linc, no!

1:22:51.121 --> 1:22:53.190
No! No!

1:22:53.223 --> 1:22:55.058
Linc, no! Get up! No!

1:22:56.426 --> 1:22:57.461
Lincoln!

1:23:16.848 --> 1:23:18.448
And we have
breaking news tonight.

1:23:18.482 --> 1:23:19.851
Authorities have
confirmed

1:23:19.884 --> 1:23:22.085
that ex-marine
Lincoln Jefferson

1:23:22.119 --> 1:23:23.788
was killed just
minutes ago

1:23:23.821 --> 1:23:26.858
when he attempted to exit the
downtown police department

1:23:26.891 --> 1:23:28.760
while holding
several hostages.

1:23:28.793 --> 1:23:30.828
...unconfirmed reports
on social media

1:23:30.862 --> 1:23:33.565
that Lincoln Jefferson
may have had contact

1:23:33.598 --> 1:23:35.499
with Islamic extremists.

1:23:35.532 --> 1:23:37.869
Information that many say
further suggests

1:23:37.902 --> 1:23:39.403
a suicide mission.

1:23:39.436 --> 1:23:40.838
He was clearly suffering

1:23:40.872 --> 1:23:43.307
from some sort
of mental illness.

1:23:43.340 --> 1:23:44.709
It's just so sad.

1:23:44.742 --> 1:23:46.678
We do have to
switch gears now

1:23:46.711 --> 1:23:49.379
and toss it over
to Steve, with sports.

1:23:49.413 --> 1:23:51.616
Basketball season
is finally upon us,

1:23:51.649 --> 1:23:54.351
and, hey, we have plenty of
early season tournament action

1:23:54.384 --> 1:23:56.420
about the kickoff
here in November.

1:23:56.453 --> 1:23:58.121
But before we get
to any of that,

1:23:58.155 --> 1:23:59.557
we gotta talk
about my man

1:23:59.591 --> 1:24:01.559
Mon'Quarion Washington.

1:24:01.593 --> 1:24:06.463
M&M, the six foot nine, 225 pound
senior, is a monster on the court.
