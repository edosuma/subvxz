Oh, yes, my sister and I did.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.669
Just awful, Mr. Putnam, poor child.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.212
We pray to Satan.

Pray, pray that he's okay, wherever he is.

-He's not the first.
-Mm.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.971
It used to be, in a town like Greendale,

02:18.054 --> 02:20.473
folks could leave
their front doors unlocked.

from Santa this year?

the Christmas tree looks great, you guys.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.776
Sabrina, I wish you wouldn't call it that.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.486
It's a Yule tree.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.572
[Hilda chuckles]
Christmas isn't so bad, Zelds.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.991
Plus, also, for someone
who doesn't believe in it,

03:20.074 --> 03:22.785
you have got yourself
quite a few presents.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.621
[Zelda] Those are not for me, Hilda.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.380
It couldn't be more perfect.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.716

Ambrose, need I remind you
of the High Priest's

when it comes to baby girls?

03:43.264 --> 03:46.935
What I can't fathom is how you expect
to keep the babe's existence a secret.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.311
What secret?

03:48.811 --> 03:49.771
There's no secret.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.732
Leticia is a long-lost Spellman

03:52.815 --> 03:55.985
sent to us from the old country to raise,
as we did Sabrina.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.528
[Ambrose] Huh.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.782
[gasps] Oh, I remember
when that was taken.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.083
I wish I could have had one Solstice
with them, Auntie.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.294
Yeah. You know what's gonna cheer you up?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.756
We're gonna roast some chestnuts,
and we're gonna...

04:16.839 --> 04:18.466
Oh, we're gonna brew some apple cider.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.885
We'll hunker down and watch
your favorite Christmas movies.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.720

04:23.221 --> 04:24.305

04:24.389 --> 04:26.766
I do. That sounds great.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.351
And I'll read <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

04:28.851 --> 04:31.104
Even Auntie Zee can appreciate that story.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.689
I like the ghosts in it.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.192
Well, Christmas is the best time
for ghost stories.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.654
Speaking of ghosts,
it's time to light the Yule log.

04:39.737 --> 04:43.283
<i>♪ Born is the King of Israel ♪</i>

04:43.408 --> 04:46.744
Remember, the Yule log
is not a decoration,

04:46.828 --> 04:47.996
it is a protection.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.332
It must burn continuously

04:51.749 --> 04:55.461
from now, through the shortest day,
through the longest night,

04:55.962 --> 04:56.838
until dawn.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.591
Otherwise, Satan knows
what malevolent forces

05:00.675 --> 05:02.635
might come down our chimney.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.722
Creatures with perhaps deadly intentions.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.601
So let's keep the log lit, shall we?

05:12.854 --> 05:16.190
And now, the Solstice blessing.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.403
[all] May the log burn,

05:28.494 --> 05:29.746
[Ambrose] All right, what is it?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.957
You haven't said two words this past week.
What's happened?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.375
Did the Grinch get to you?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.044
Or the Dark Lord, perhaps?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.713
Things are different this year, Ambrose.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.923
I signed my name in his <i>Book of the Beast.</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:43.634
Like the rest of us. Life goes on.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.637
Your friends have accepted
that you're a witch. You told me so.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.306
Er... More or less.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.558
I'm kind of keeping my distance from them.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.685
Giving them some time
to get used to the idea.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.023
Maybe you should be doing
the exact opposite,

05:57.273 --> 05:59.484
reassuring them that it's all good,

06:00.234 --> 06:01.319
-business as usual.
-[sighs]

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
Maybe.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.864
I don't know. Honestly...

06:05.990 --> 06:09.744
[sighs] Times like this,
I wish I could ask my mom for advice.

06:10.578 --> 06:14.916
Like, I could ask her how exactly
my dad told her he was a warlock.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.501
-Hm.
-And how she reacted.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.338
How long did it take her
to get used to the idea?

06:20.755 --> 06:21.756
Did she...

06:22.298 --> 06:24.133
did she think about breaking up
with my dad

06:24.217 --> 06:26.969
-the way I broke up with Harvey?
-Mm, cousin...

06:28.137 --> 06:31.099
Every girl wants to talk to their mum
after a bad breakup.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.435
The other thing is...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.855
I saw her, Ambrose, in limbo.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.652
When I was trying to rescue Tommy.
She was confused, haunted, trapped.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.569
If she's in limbo,

06:43.653 --> 06:46.030
then that must mean she has
some unfinished business that's...

06:46.114 --> 06:47.532
keeping her from passing on.

06:47.615 --> 06:51.035
Exactly. And if she could tell me
what it was, I could help her.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.788
And how would she tell you?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.418
We could have a séance.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.002
You said it yourself, Ambrose,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.672
-Christmas is the perfect time for ghosts.
-In fiction.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.551
Solstice is when the veil between the
living and the dead is at its thinnest.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.513
That's why we burn the Yule logs,
to keep the bad things out.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.141
-My mother is not a bad thing.
-Er...

07:15.977 --> 07:16.811
Anyway.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
It was just an idea.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.816
[owl hooting]

07:21.899 --> 07:26.070
Dark Lord, as the longest night
approaches, answer me.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.614
I did what you asked.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.493
Sabrina signed her name
in your <i>Book of the Beast.</i>

07:32.577 --> 07:34.036
Why have you forsaken me?

07:35.538 --> 07:38.040
Why have you not called me
home to the Pit?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.585
Has my mission changed?

07:41.419 --> 07:42.378
Say the word.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.589
Give my life meaning.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.091
Give me a sign.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.468

07:50.011 --> 07:51.929
Happy Solstice, Ms. Wardwell.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015

07:55.600 --> 07:57.560
Bright Yuletide to you and your family.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.896
[sighs]

07:59.979 --> 08:02.982
I was hoping to ask you a favor,
Ms. Wardwell.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.776
Remember when I went to limbo?

08:06.986 --> 08:07.862
Vividly.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.655
I saw my mom there.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.701
We didn't talk that much,
but she looked like she needed help.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.786
Really?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.372
I want to have a séance, Ms. Wardwell,

08:18.956 --> 08:19.790
to contact her.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.252
So I was hoping you could lend me
your <i>Book of the Dead.</i>

08:24.253 --> 08:25.087
Again.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.006
[chuckles]

08:28.257 --> 08:30.968
Ah, there's no way
I'm going to dissuade you, is there?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.304
And if I deny you,

08:33.471 --> 08:36.474
you'll just ask your chums at the Academy
for a <i>Book of the Dead,</i> won't you?

08:36.557 --> 08:37.975
That's where I'm going after school.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.728
Well, then, who am I to...

08:41.562 --> 08:42.897
keep a daughter from her mother?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.524
But, Sabrina, be careful.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.776
Mind nothing unspeakable

08:47.235 --> 08:49.153
breaks through with your mumsie.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.615
Well...

08:54.075 --> 08:55.743
do let me know how it goes.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.746
I will.
And thanks for the book, Ms. Wardwell.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.498
You're the best.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.916
Oh!

09:11.926 --> 09:13.135
Oh, Stolas.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.222
A demoness's work is never done, is it?

09:20.309 --> 09:22.853
If Sabrina contacts her mortal mother,

09:23.479 --> 09:25.940
who knows what disturbing things

09:26.023 --> 09:29.235
mommy dearest might say
to her daughter fair?

09:30.319 --> 09:33.239
And after we've just gotten her
to sign on the dotted line.

09:34.949 --> 09:35.783
No.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.912
Better to disrupt the proceedings,
I think.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.916
[Rosalind]
You want us to be a part of your séance?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.042
Yeah.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.210
To contact my mom.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.590
I mean, no pressure, of course, but...

09:51.924 --> 09:53.593
I thought I'd at least ask.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.885
Erm...

09:56.095 --> 09:57.430
Is it too soon?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.723
And too weird?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.850
Or... both?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.226
-Too soon.
-Too weird.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.441
Plus, my cousins are staying with us
for Christmas, so...

10:08.524 --> 10:11.235
And I'm pretty much working full-time
until Christmas Eve.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.907
Susie, uh, tell Sabrina what you're doing.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.163
Playing Jingles the Christmas Elf
at Santa's Play Land.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.165
-Oh, my gosh! Susie, really?
-[laughs]

10:24.248 --> 10:26.667
-You've wanted to do that for years.
-I know!

10:26.751 --> 10:30.421
And Mr. Bartel, who's playing Santa,
is basically the Grinch,

10:30.504 --> 10:33.090
but you guys should come by
Knights of St. Bernard Hall.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.551
-Definitely.
-Absolutely. Count me...

10:36.552 --> 10:37.386
in.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.103
Will you guys excuse me for a minute?

10:51.942 --> 10:54.153
I wasn't sure if we were gonna talk
before break.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.572
I wanted to give you some space.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.367
I appreciate that, Brina.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.622
[sighs] Harvey,
the last real talk we had...

11:05.665 --> 11:07.833
you said every time you look at me,

11:07.917 --> 11:09.335
all you see is your brother.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.671
Is that still true?

11:15.841 --> 11:16.926
Um...

11:17.510 --> 11:18.761
But it-- it's getting better.

11:20.137 --> 11:20.971
I think.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.685
How's your dad holding up?

11:26.977 --> 11:29.814
[sighs] He's still drinking.
It's the worst it's ever been.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.567
Can you call anyone to help? Your grandpa?

11:33.651 --> 11:36.654
I tried, but my dad doesn't want anyone
seeing him this way.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.032
[sighs]

11:40.116 --> 11:41.242
Oh.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.953
I got you something for Christmas.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.747
Open it.

11:52.920 --> 11:57.049
They're these special colored pencils
my Aunt Hilda found in a shop in England.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.176
Their tips never wear down.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.596
So, they're magic.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.142
I'd say... enchanted.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.398
Is that not okay?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.192
No, no, uh...

12:17.737 --> 12:18.571
They're great.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.991
Thanks, Sabrina. Thanks for this.

12:24.076 --> 12:24.910
I, uh...

12:28.914 --> 12:30.166
I'll see you after break.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.627
Merry Christmas, Harvey.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.046
See you after break.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.898
Bright Solstice, ladies.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.317
Bright Solstice, Sabrina.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.904
Oh, if you're looking for Nicholas,
he just left.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.822
He's off to the Unholy Lands
for the holidays.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.367
I wasn't.
Actually, I was looking for you guys.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.703
What are you doin' tonight?

13:08.120 --> 13:08.954
No plans.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.874
Everybody else is going home to see
their families over the holidays.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.584
Why were you asking?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.879
I'm having a séance on the down low

13:16.962 --> 13:19.215
and I would love for you three to join.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.925
Who are you trying to contact?

13:21.008 --> 13:22.176
My mortal mother.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.428
But it's a secret.
I don't want my aunts to know.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.015
Oh! Can we, Prudence?
I just adore séances.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.768
And I've been practicing my skills
as a spiritualist.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.396
And we three know
what it's like not to have a mother.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.732
Does that mean you'll help me?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.820
-'Tis the season.
-Amazing. I'll leave my window unlocked.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.405
We'll convene in my bedroom
near the witching hour.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.158
-I have a few things to do before that.
-Stuffing some stockings?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.536
-[chuckles]
-Making some eggnog, actually.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
[Christmas music playing]

13:58.087 --> 14:00.256
[gasps] Susie!

14:00.339 --> 14:01.924
[both laugh]

14:04.844 --> 14:07.179
-Ohhh!
-Mm!

14:07.263 --> 14:10.099
The Elf on the Shelf
can eat his stuffed heart out

14:10.182 --> 14:12.518
because you look amazing.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.644
Thanks, Roz.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.437
I've always wanted to be Jingles,

14:15.521 --> 14:18.023
and this was probably the last year
I'd be short enough to do it.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.191
Hey, Jingles.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.735
We're back on the clock,
if you don't mind.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.778
Yeah.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.197
Do you want a ride home?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.616
'Cause honestly, I don't mind
hanging out for a bit.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.826
No, I'm okay.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.704
After the hall closes, Mr. Bartel
and I have to get everything ready

14:31.787 --> 14:32.746
for the final push.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.873
[Mr. Bartel clears throat]

14:34.665 --> 14:37.042
These next two days are gonna kill me.
[laughs]

14:37.126 --> 14:39.378
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

14:39.503 --> 14:41.672
Okay, uh, well,
I'll talk to you tomorrow, then.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.382
-For sure.
-Cool.

14:43.465 --> 14:44.800
Bye, Roz. Ready?

14:44.884 --> 14:45.968
[girl] Yeah. Okay.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.554
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

14:48.637 --> 14:49.889
Merry Christmas!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.223
Ho-ho!

14:51.307 --> 14:52.725
[music stops]

14:52.808 --> 14:54.184
[voices echoing]

14:57.605 --> 14:58.480
You ready?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.107
[Mr. Bartel] Ho-ho-ho!

15:00.190 --> 15:02.192
[music returns]

15:07.406 --> 15:09.658
Appreciate you staying late, Susie.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.452
It's my pleasure, Mr. Bartel.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.121
So, you, uh...

15:15.539 --> 15:17.249
You have plans for the holidays?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.710
Some big family gathering?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.713
Nope, it's just me and my dad.

15:23.005 --> 15:23.839
[chuckles]

15:26.967 --> 15:28.052
Careful there, Susie.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.219
Those are precious.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.557
I made each and every one myself,
did you know that?

15:35.142 --> 15:36.477
[roaring sound]

15:37.269 --> 15:40.314
Usually, I have to go out
to find the prettiest,

15:41.148 --> 15:42.816
the most special child to harvest,

15:43.651 --> 15:45.653
but this year, that child came to me.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.448
Mr. Bartel--

15:51.200 --> 15:52.743
[loud thump]

16:06.215 --> 16:08.092
Warden of the longest night,

16:09.218 --> 16:12.262
fey things fear the Yule fire's light.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.351
But Yule flame dead

16:17.685 --> 16:19.436
then portal's laid bare...

16:21.271 --> 16:23.440
now darkness comes to trick...

16:25.317 --> 16:26.527
and to tear.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.362
[whoosh]

16:33.117 --> 16:35.160
-[Agatha] Sabrina, your mother's dress.
-Right.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.135
All right, then.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.095
Hands face down on the table,

16:53.429 --> 16:54.430
pinkies touching.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.807
Now, focus your energy.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.517
Send it into the table.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.102
When Diana's spirit is here,

17:00.185 --> 17:02.938
she may speak herself or through me
or some combination.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.026
Spirits below and above,

17:07.109 --> 17:10.279
spirits in between,
caught in the fabric betwixt worlds,

17:10.779 --> 17:13.240
we ask that the veil be lifted
and that you send forth

17:13.365 --> 17:16.243
the spirit of Diana Regina
Sawyer-Spellman.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.580
Diana, you're welcome to this house,
to this circle.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.750
If you're here, we ask
that you make your presence known.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.085
[wind whistling]

17:26.170 --> 17:28.047
[whispering voices]

17:28.589 --> 17:30.049
[gasps]

17:30.966 --> 17:32.134
She says she's here.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.972
But spirits love to play tricks,
so ask her a question.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.183
Something <i>only </i>your mother would know.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.980
Spirit, if you are my mother...

17:47.441 --> 17:48.734
then how did you die?

17:50.527 --> 17:51.987
She's saying...

17:52.071 --> 17:53.947
two, three...

17:54.782 --> 17:56.992
-three, one.
-That doesn't make any sense.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.994
My mother and father
died in a plane crash.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.913
Their flight number was...

18:02.289 --> 18:03.624
2331.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.127
So...

18:08.337 --> 18:10.005
it is you, Mom.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.050
She says that, yes, it is.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.177
I have so many questions for you.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.472
But first, I want...

18:19.807 --> 18:21.058
[sighs]

18:22.392 --> 18:23.811
I wish I could see you again.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.814
She says she'll try.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.981
Do you feel that?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.610
Like static electricity
building in the air?

18:31.693 --> 18:33.320
-Agatha--
-Don't break your focus, Sabrina.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.322
She's coming through.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.366
[electric crackling]

18:49.586 --> 18:50.420
Mom?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.048
Mom!

18:54.258 --> 18:55.217
You're beautiful.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.638
She says, "Thank you."

19:01.431 --> 19:03.725
Mom, why are you in limbo?

19:05.227 --> 19:09.565
[sighs] Is there something
I can help you finish or do?

19:10.190 --> 19:13.360
"Not... safe," she says.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.029
What do you mean?
You're not safe or I'm not?

19:16.113 --> 19:19.074
-One question at a time, Sabrina.
-How can I help you, Mom?

19:19.199 --> 19:22.035
-Please. Please tell me.
-Wait, wait, wait. Something's wrong.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.955
-There's an interference.
-What kind of interference?

19:25.038 --> 19:26.290
-Other spirits.
-Mom?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.000
Mom? Is some-- Is someone with you?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.502
[roaring sound]

19:32.379 --> 19:34.423
[echoing child's laughter]

19:34.506 --> 19:36.466
[static crackling]

19:36.550 --> 19:38.343
-[hooting]
-[laughter echoing]

19:42.556 --> 19:44.266
[glass shatters]

19:46.310 --> 19:48.478
[gasps] No!

19:49.563 --> 19:50.647
Hm--

19:50.731 --> 19:52.107
Wh-- What happened here?

19:52.232 --> 19:54.985
[gasps] Hilda, the Yule log.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.948
Relight the damn thing.
I'll warn Sabrina and Ambrose.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.242
Agatha, what's happening?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.912
-Yeah, Agatha, what's wrong with her?
-I'm not-- I'm not sure.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.955
It could be that other entities
are threatening her

20:07.039 --> 20:08.081
or coming in after her.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.752
-I'm breaking the connection.
-Agatha, no, it's too soon.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.837
-We've barely gotten started.
-I'm sorry, Sabrina.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.048
Mom, whatever's going on,
don't go, please.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.301
-Please stay with me.
-Sabrina, the Yule log's gone out!

20:21.345 --> 20:23.347
-Diana.
-Mom, don't!

20:39.071 --> 20:39.988
Sabrina.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.284
Aunt Zelda, I can explain everything.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.036
I think you'd better.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.540
And as for you three,

20:51.041 --> 20:54.336
haven't you got to get back to the academy
for some sort of bed check?

20:59.383 --> 21:01.510
I swear, Aunt Zelda,
I didn't put out the log.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.263
Oh, I see, so it is a mere coincidence

21:04.346 --> 21:08.308
that the Yule log, lit to keep away
all unearthly things, including spirits...

21:08.392 --> 21:10.435
-[purrs and meows]
-...was unlit at the exact time

21:10.519 --> 21:12.562
you decided
to convene with your mother's ghost?

21:12.646 --> 21:13.939
Uh-- I know how it looks.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.358
And tell me, why tonight,

21:16.942 --> 21:19.152
of all nights, on the eve of the Solstice,

21:19.236 --> 21:21.947
did you suddenly feel the need
to contact your mother?

21:22.030 --> 21:24.491
It wasn't sudden, Aunt Zelda.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.537
I saw my mom trapped in limbo

21:29.121 --> 21:30.414
and I wanted to release her.

21:30.497 --> 21:34.543
If that's true, why in Satan's name
didn't you tell us?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.337
We could have helped you and Diana.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.672
You would have done that?

21:38.755 --> 21:39.589
Of course.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.217
Diana was my brother's wife.
Honestly, Sabrina,

21:42.301 --> 21:45.345
sometimes I don't think you understand
the meaning of family at all.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.639
Ambrose, love, er, did you find anything?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.725
I checked every room and closet.

21:50.392 --> 21:54.146
If some malevolence
got in whilst the Yule log was out...

21:54.688 --> 21:55.814
Hm.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.733
They left once Aunt Hilda re-lit it.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.194
Or they're very adept at hiding.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.283
Either way,
so much for a peaceful Solstice.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.618
I'm going to bed.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.247
I suggest everyone sleep
with a lit warding candle

22:12.706 --> 22:14.624
and pray to Satan to keep us safe.

22:15.083 --> 22:15.959
Zelda?

22:16.376 --> 22:17.210
What, Hilda?

22:17.294 --> 22:19.296
Should I perhaps sleep
in my old room again?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.256
I think you'd better. But no snoring.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.967
Leticia's a very light sleeper.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.928
Well, I thought it would help you
if I slept with you.

22:37.647 --> 22:38.774
Did you find out, cuz?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.443
What was keeping your mum in limbo?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.823
I... I didn't get the chance to.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.660
Mm. Did you... ask her
what to do about Harvey?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.791
Oh, Sabrina, I am sorry.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.043
Will you try again?

23:00.837 --> 23:01.963
[sighs]

23:03.173 --> 23:04.591
Maybe after Solstice.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.267
[gong strikes]

23:14.684 --> 23:16.645
Peekaboo.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.314
I see you!

23:19.398 --> 23:22.150
-[cooing]
-Peekaboo.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.652
I see you!

23:23.735 --> 23:25.737
[cooing]

23:27.280 --> 23:28.657
Where's the baby?

23:28.740 --> 23:29.950
There's the baby!

23:31.410 --> 23:32.369
Where's the baby?

23:32.452 --> 23:34.287
There's the baby!

23:34.871 --> 23:37.416
-Morning, Aunties.
-Oh! Blessed morning, darling.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.793
It is a blessed morning,

23:39.876 --> 23:43.422
considering none of us had our throats
slit by malevolencies during the night.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.464
Aunt Zelda...

23:45.006 --> 23:46.842
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about my mom.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.427
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.762
In fact, it was the exact opposite.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.180
Oh, as King Lear famously said,

23:52.264 --> 23:54.599
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth

23:54.683 --> 23:57.519
-it is to have an ungrateful child."
-What?

23:57.602 --> 23:59.438
So you're allowed to kidnap babies,

23:59.521 --> 24:02.190
but I'm not allowed to want
to contact my own mother?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.191
To want to help her?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.486
Of course you are, but not at the risk
of everyone in this house.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.698
-I didn't put out the--
-Oh, fine, Sabrina.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.824
I believe you.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.997
And I'm sorry you didn't get
what you wanted from Diana.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.584
Perhaps in the new year,
we can all try contacting her again.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.296
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to give Leticia her Solstice bath.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.673
[Leticia cooing]

24:26.756 --> 24:28.508
Who's a dirty girl?

24:28.592 --> 24:30.844
Yes, you're a dirty girl!

24:31.970 --> 24:34.139
-What did I do wrong, Aunt Hilda?
-Hm?

24:34.222 --> 24:37.100
[chuckles] Oh, it's not you, my love,
it's Zelds.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.270
You may have noticed,
but she's a hard woman, your aunt.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.274
She was just very cold with your mum.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.860
She just never let her into her heart,
you know?

24:48.028 --> 24:49.237
-And then...
-And then...

24:49.905 --> 24:51.072
Mom and Dad died.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.783
Yeah.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.663
Zelda has always regretted
the bad blood between them.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.374
I mean... she never said it, but...

25:02.209 --> 25:05.962
I think that's why she's so heaven-bent
on protecting you nowadays.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.381
You know, like she's got
something to prove.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.301
I keep making messes, don't I?

25:11.384 --> 25:12.302
Mm-hmm.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.181
Well, this one's not yours.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.935
And you do your fair share
of clearing them up.

25:20.018 --> 25:20.977
What's that?

25:21.228 --> 25:24.481
It's a special eggnog I made
for Harvey's dad using your secret recipe.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.565
Oh.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.485
One cup of this and Mr. Kinkle
will never want alcohol again.

25:29.903 --> 25:33.532
I can't help my mom,
but I can help him and Harvey, at least.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.662
Where did you find my secret recipe?

-So mote it be.
-Fine, then.

38:57.585 --> 39:02.173
Let there be a circle on the floor.
Put the babe in the middle of the circle.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.676
You, Zelda, will take
one of the babe's hands.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.970
You, Gryla, will take the other.

39:08.679 --> 39:12.058
Whoever has the strength
to pull the child out of the circle

39:12.850 --> 39:13.809
wins the babe.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.646
-[gasps]
-What?

39:18.689 --> 39:19.607
Accepted.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.735
Accepted.

39:29.742 --> 39:30.618
Sabrina,

39:31.452 --> 39:33.662
put the babe in the circle of salt.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.872
Mom, are you sure?

39:40.669 --> 39:41.962
[Leticia coos]

39:59.021 --> 40:00.314
[Leticia cries]

40:13.452 --> 40:14.328
Stop!

40:15.371 --> 40:16.622
I won't do it.

40:16.705 --> 40:18.332
I won't tear the baby to pieces.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.001
-Then the baby is Gryla's.
-No!

40:24.380 --> 40:25.506
Sorry, Aunt Zelda,

40:25.965 --> 40:27.007
but fair is fair.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.551
Come to mother Gryla, babe,

40:29.468 --> 40:30.928
and you'll never be cold,

40:31.595 --> 40:32.847
you'll never be hurt,

40:33.597 --> 40:34.932
and you'll never be alone.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.186
A bright Solstice to you all.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.314
Follow me, laddies.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.733
[Lads' laughter echoing]

40:53.742 --> 40:56.495
Did-- Sabrina, how could you do that?

40:58.956 --> 40:59.790
We didn't.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.921
We would never give up baby Leticia
to Gryla.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.090
I don't understand.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.849
What did you give to Gryla, then?

41:16.932 --> 41:18.601
I pulled an old changeling trick.

41:21.687 --> 41:24.482
<i>I enchanted Ambrose's teddy bear</i>
<i>to look like Leticia.</i>

41:25.608 --> 41:27.568
<i>Gryla will be long gone</i>
<i>and in the mountains</i>

41:27.651 --> 41:28.736
<i>before the spell wears off.</i>

41:29.069 --> 41:31.155
But how did you know how to do that?

41:32.698 --> 41:33.991
-My mom helped me.
-[purring]

41:35.159 --> 41:36.410
After Leticia cried out,

41:36.911 --> 41:39.205
she appeared and
told me the spell to make the switch.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.832
Well, she picked up a few tricks
from Edward, didn't she?

41:41.916 --> 41:42.917
[chuckles]

41:43.000 --> 41:44.376
Diana, thank you.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.839
-Mom?
-What happened? Where'd she go?

41:50.132 --> 41:51.884
[banging at door]

41:51.967 --> 41:52.885
[sighs]

41:53.344 --> 41:54.970
Who the bloody hell is that now?

41:55.054 --> 41:57.806
Probably Gryla, wise to your antics.

41:59.266 --> 42:01.852
Susie's been missing since last night
and I think she's in trouble.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.979
-Susie's missing? For how long?
-Uh...

42:04.063 --> 42:07.358
Mr. Putman fell asleep in front of the TV
and never heard her come home last night,

42:07.441 --> 42:10.402
and her bed hadn't been slept in
and he's talking to the police now, but...

42:10.945 --> 42:13.322
I went to Knight of St. Bernard
where she was working and...

42:14.114 --> 42:15.324
that's when it happened.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.994
I had one of my cunning visions.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.790
<i>Mr. Bartel, who plays Santa,</i>
<i>looked like some kind of demon.</i>

42:23.916 --> 42:27.378
<i>I think he's been taking kids</i>
<i>and dipping them in wax.</i>

42:28.587 --> 42:29.964
<i>And I think he has Susie.</i>

42:30.589 --> 42:32.633
-Did you say Bartel?
-Yeah, yes.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.593
Bartel is the name of a Yule demon.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.595
That can't be a coincidence
at this time of year.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.348
Well, how do we find him?
A divination spell?

42:39.431 --> 42:40.975
No need to be so baroque.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.230
The Greendale White Pages.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.027
Oh. There we are.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.905
Sin Bartel lives at 731 Pascack Road.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.283
-Great, let's go.
-Not so fast, Sabrina.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.951
Solstice is their time.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.161
Demons are very powerful tonight.

43:01.912 --> 43:03.539
We're going to need a little help.

43:03.622 --> 43:05.791
Gryla can't have gotten far,
we'll summon her back.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.751
Gryla? Why would we do that?

43:07.835 --> 43:11.046
Bartel hurts children.
There's nothing Gryla detests more.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.382
But we tricked her.
Won't she be mad at us?

43:13.465 --> 43:17.094
Oh, no, not if we lead her to the lair
of a demon who preys on little ones.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.513
Rosalind, can you stay and mind
baby Leticia?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.515
-Uh... Sure.
-Thank you.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.018
If things go sideways at Bartel's,

43:24.101 --> 43:25.811
I don't want to put any more
mortals at risk.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.021
-Come on.
-Mm.

43:27.521 --> 43:28.480
[sighs]

43:28.564 --> 43:30.774
Brina, is this what it's like
being a witch?

43:31.483 --> 43:34.153
You know, hosting séances
and fighting demons?

43:34.236 --> 43:35.487
[Sabrina chuckles] Not usually.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.073
Except kind of.

43:38.741 --> 43:39.658
Huh.

43:41.577 --> 43:42.661
Uh...

43:46.457 --> 43:49.335
Let go of me, Mr. Bartel!
Whatever you are.

43:49.418 --> 43:51.837
-Just let go of me!
-Shh!

43:53.756 --> 43:57.801
Aah! The wax is almost ready, hm?

43:58.552 --> 44:01.305
-[grunts]
-Yes!

44:01.388 --> 44:02.640
[chuckles]

44:04.767 --> 44:08.354
Aah, you'll make a most splendid addition

44:09.021 --> 44:10.689
-to my display, Susie.
-[panting]

44:11.357 --> 44:14.151
And all the joy you'll bring to children

44:14.693 --> 44:16.695
for decades to come, huh?

44:16.779 --> 44:18.322
-[chuckles]
-[Yule Lads' laughter]

44:18.405 --> 44:20.658
-What?
-[running footsteps]

44:21.825 --> 44:23.869
-Who's there?
-[clattering]

44:24.662 --> 44:27.164
-[gasps]
-[creaking]

44:27.247 --> 44:28.999
[Lads' laughter echoing]

44:30.042 --> 44:32.127
You hurt children, demon.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.964
And trap their souls in wax.

44:37.633 --> 44:38.717
That won't do.

44:41.887 --> 44:42.721
Not...

44:43.305 --> 44:44.181
at...

44:44.264 --> 44:45.474
all.

-[Bartel screaming]

44:56.318 --> 44:58.529
What's happening? Who are you?

44:58.779 --> 45:00.989
Are you alone in the world, child?

45:02.241 --> 45:03.200
I have my dad.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.452
Then you may leave.

45:06.036 --> 45:08.288
You will not want to see what comes next.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.625
[Bartel gasping]

45:12.042 --> 45:13.168

45:23.679 --> 45:25.556
-[Zelda] Oh, praise Satan.
-Susie!

45:29.059 --> 45:29.893
Are you okay?

45:29.977 --> 45:32.938
I'm fine, but there's a demon in there,
and a witch, I think.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.107
Oh, my gosh, my dad.

45:35.190 --> 45:37.317
We'll take you right home
and explain everything to him.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.819
No! That I was kidnapped by a demon?

45:38.902 --> 45:41.029
No, he'll never let me get
an after-school job again.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.699
Well, maybe not everything,
but I have some nice shortbread cookies

45:43.782 --> 45:46.660
that will make him think the last 12 hours
had been but a dream, okay?

45:47.703 --> 45:49.079
Come on. Come on.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.259
Gather round, my Yule children.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.597
Tonight, we celebrate the Solstice

46:07.055 --> 46:09.475
and welcome new members to our family...

46:09.558 --> 46:10.642
[Yule Lads' laughter]

46:10.726 --> 46:13.437
...with a festival of lights.

46:24.531 --> 46:25.783
[door opens]

46:27.534 --> 46:28.619
Where have you lot been?

46:28.702 --> 46:31.205
We saved Susie from a demon
and then erased her dad's memory.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.165
-[chuckles] Sounds about right.
-Where's Roz?

46:33.248 --> 46:36.418
I teleported her home
before her parents started to worry.

46:37.085 --> 46:38.337
How's Leticia faring?

46:38.754 --> 46:41.215
Not a cry since her bottle.

46:42.841 --> 46:44.968
She's a strong, brave girl.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.428
[Ambrose] Yes, she is.

46:47.721 --> 46:48.806
Aunt Zelda?

46:49.890 --> 46:50.808
What is it?

46:53.268 --> 46:55.062
[gasps] I've made a decision.

46:56.230 --> 46:57.356
About Leticia.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.569
I'm taking her to Desmelda's
after the midwinter holiday.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.615
Ambrose was right.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.910
We can't keep her a secret
from Father Blackwood forever.

47:10.911 --> 47:13.121
And what if, Satan forbid,

47:13.205 --> 47:15.123
Gryla were to come back next Solstice,

47:15.207 --> 47:17.167
or next week, for that matter?

47:20.128 --> 47:21.922
The truth is, she's not safe here.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.967
She's safer than with her father.

47:29.263 --> 47:32.266
Desmelda can raise her in seclusion.

47:33.559 --> 47:36.436
Teaching her the old ways,
as is her birthright.

47:36.812 --> 47:40.607
Of course, I'll visit her and provide
for her, that's only right. I'm...

47:42.234 --> 47:44.444
I'm her Night Mother, after all.

47:44.528 --> 47:47.364
-Aunt Zee...
-No, Sabrina, I've quite made up my mind.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.953
Besides, I've got more than my hands full
with you lot.

47:55.497 --> 47:57.082
Let me take her, Ambrose.

47:57.165 --> 47:58.375
[Ambrose] Sh, sh, sh.

47:59.334 --> 48:01.169
-There we go.
-I'll put her to bed.

48:01.587 --> 48:02.462
Okay.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.104
Mom?

48:20.105 --> 48:21.773
We don't have much time, Sabrina.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.942
And there...

48:25.152 --> 48:26.737
There are so many things I wanna ask you.

48:27.321 --> 48:28.155
Why, Mom?

48:28.655 --> 48:30.407
Why aren't you free?

48:30.949 --> 48:33.827
What kind of unfinished business
do you have?

48:33.952 --> 48:37.039
I was afraid you weren't going
to be loved and protected

48:37.122 --> 48:39.708
as I would have loved and protected you.

48:40.709 --> 48:42.002
But tonight, I saw.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.171
You are.

48:45.422 --> 48:46.632
You have mothers.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.468
A family that adores you.

48:51.053 --> 48:51.887
I do.

48:55.390 --> 48:56.224
Mom,

48:56.725 --> 48:57.768
there's a boy.

48:58.894 --> 49:00.687
A boy named Harvey Kinkle.

49:01.063 --> 49:01.939
Yes.

49:02.606 --> 49:03.607
He's like you.

49:04.274 --> 49:06.443
Mortal. And I just...

49:07.945 --> 49:09.655
I don't know what to do about him.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.576
When your father told me he was a witch,

49:15.285 --> 49:19.206
I followed Edward along
the Path of Night as much as I could,

49:19.289 --> 49:22.209
but I wouldn't lead anyone else down it.

49:32.594 --> 49:33.845
I think I understand.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.515
Oh, sweet girl.

49:38.684 --> 49:42.104
If I could hold you in my arms
one last time...

50:30.027 --> 50:32.279
My, um... dad's doing better.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.323
He woke up this morning
and said he was done drinking.

50:35.615 --> 50:38.326
He just poured out all his bottles
into the sink.

50:38.577 --> 50:39.745
That's great news.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.164
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.458
So...

50:45.042 --> 50:46.960
thanks for the enchanted eggnog.

50:47.711 --> 50:48.795
If that's what it was.

50:53.633 --> 50:55.969
But please don't ever do that again.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.348
Use magic with me.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.310
Or on me, or near me.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.104
Not ever again.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.274
-Uh... I-- I did it to--
-Help me. I know.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.277
Just like how you did with Tommy.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.576
I don't trust it, Sabrina.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.121
That's why...

51:27.751 --> 51:28.877
I can't keep these.

51:37.719 --> 51:38.845
I hope you understand.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.269
Of course, Harvey.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.192
Well, I should get back to my dad.

51:53.401 --> 51:54.236
But...

51:55.821 --> 51:56.822
Merry Christmas.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.116
Or...
