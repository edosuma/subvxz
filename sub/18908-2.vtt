00:06.800 --> 00:09.067
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:10.067 --> 00:10.567
- Good morning, smaller Bowmans.
- Hey, Devon.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.267
- I think she's
gotten her hands dirty.

00:13.300 --> 00:13.467
- What--so you're gonna accuse
me of being dirty,

00:14.100 --> 00:15.467
but I can't defend myself?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.267
- We're outside the colony,
aren't we?

00:17.300 --> 00:20.167
- We're locked in here.
- What if we aren't?

00:20.200 --> 00:23.133
- Hands up! On your knees.
- Get down. Give me your hands.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.500
- Come on. Let's go.
Move!

00:24.533 --> 00:26.367
- Mom.
- Bram.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.533
- Can Dad get me out of here?

00:27.567 --> 00:29.467
- Dad's at Santa Monica.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.000
- This will get you through
the Santa Monica Gateway.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.600
Go find your son.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.633
- I'm looking for a boy.
His name's Charlie.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.833
I heard he works for Solomon.

00:38.067 --> 00:41.000
[grunting]

00:42.233 --> 00:43.800
I need your help.

00:54.233 --> 00:57.500
- What is that?
Is it, um--

00:57.533 --> 00:59.433
- Kind of sounds like music.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.433
- It can't be.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.567
Houston, are you
still receiving us?

01:03.600 --> 01:05.833
- We're on the dark side.
Lost line of sight.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.667
- That was strange.
Are we recording?

01:07.700 --> 01:10.067
- Yes, sir.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.733
- It must be UHF interference
bouncing off the atmosphere.

01:12.767 --> 01:15.400
- That's not interference.

01:15.433 --> 01:16.900
Oh, my God. Look at that.

01:16.933 --> 01:19.400
What the hell is that?

01:19.433 --> 01:20.567
Houston--

01:26.067 --> 01:28.733
- So, we were able to isolate
the sound they were hearing.

01:28.767 --> 01:34.733
[ambient warbling
and static crackling]

01:43.667 --> 01:46.667
- I ordered a rudimentary
analysis on the music.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.267
- And?
- Seems to have

01:49.300 --> 01:50.267
mathematical structure,

01:50.300 --> 01:52.233
but otherwise inconclusive.

01:52.267 --> 01:56.200
- Our best guess:
some kind of message.

01:56.233 --> 01:59.067
- We need to send a response.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.467
- But how?

02:01.500 --> 02:03.567
- Maybe that thing is
some kind of beacon.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.500
- I have papers.
- We're on lockdown.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.100
Come back tomorrow morning.

03:11.467 --> 03:15.100
- Please. He's 16. I just need
to know that he's okay.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.067
- Name?
- Bram Bowman.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.900
- He's been moved
out of the zone.

03:28.933 --> 03:30.567
- The Factory?

03:30.600 --> 03:33.200
- I don't know. All it says is
he's in transit.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.833
[indistinct chatter]

03:35.867 --> 03:38.900
- I showed you
my documentation already!

03:38.933 --> 03:40.200
- Thank you.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.233
- No, stay with me.

- Stand right there.

I haven't seen your ID yet.

- I'm here to see Maddie Kenner.
- ID?

I have a Katie Bowman
here for you.

- Hands on the gate.

- You, out of line.

- Hey, sweet girl.
Do you know where your aunt is?

05:14.267 --> 05:16.067
- She's upstairs.
- Good morning, Mrs. Bowman.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.333
You look...damp.

05:20.133 --> 05:24.067
- Maddie? Mad?

05:26.800 --> 05:28.467
- What's wrong?
- They transferred Bram.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.867
- What? That's impossible.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.700
- I just came
from the holding facility.

05:31.733 --> 05:33.067
I mean, it's--it's the Factory.
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.667
- There's no other place
he could go.

05:34.700 --> 05:35.833
- Stop, stop, stop.
- There's no other place--

05:35.867 --> 05:37.400
- Stop.
You cannot think that way.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.533
- Maddie, they send people
to the Factory

05:38.567 --> 05:39.867
for sneezing in the wrong place.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.333
They caught my son going
under the Wall.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.167
- Katie, listen to me.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.733
Nolan is on our side.

05:44.767 --> 05:46.367
He knows that Bram is
a good kid.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.967
Let me just talk to him
and find out what is going on.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.967
Oh, sweetheart.

05:52.067 --> 05:55.667
[Katie crying]
Oh, honey.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.067
- I'm so scared.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.667
- I know.
Just try to stay calm.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.933
I will get him out.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.233
I promise you.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.800
Okay?

06:09.833 --> 06:13.100
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.

06:13.133 --> 06:14.567
- [sniffles]
- Okay.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.267
- Good.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.433
Let's start with this one.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.900
Are you ready for the rest
of our lesson?

06:20.933 --> 06:22.067
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.633
- All right, Gracie.
Time to get your stuff.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.300
- We aren't finished
with our lesson.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.400
- Please, Mom. Can I stay?

06:37.067 --> 06:38.433
- Yeah.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.767
Just promise me that Aunt Maddie
will have you home before dark.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.367
Yes?
- Okay.

06:51.367 --> 06:59.267

06:59.300 --> 07:02.800
- So, what are you doing
in Santa Monica?

07:02.833 --> 07:05.100
- Charlie got trapped
on this side of the Wall.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.500
- Oh, Jesus.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.133
- Yeah.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.600
- [sighs] So, how's the rest
of the family holding up?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.467
- Fine.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.100
- How'd you get
through the Wall?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.600
- I took a job
with the Occupation

07:19.633 --> 07:21.467
so I could look for Charlie.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.267
They gave me a pass.

07:23.300 --> 07:26.367
- When?
- I got here a couple weeks ago.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.833
- And you decide to wait
till after you get stabbed

07:28.867 --> 07:30.667
to come find me?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.633
- I didn't want to get you
caught up in this mess.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.667
- It's your son, Will.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.467
- What the hell happened
on this bloc?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.667
It's like "Black Hawk Down"
out there.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.133
- They didn't have
enough Redhats on the ground

07:47.167 --> 07:48.200
after the Arrival.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.767
Shit got worse and worse

07:49.800 --> 07:53.067
until the Occupation cut a deal
with the warlords.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.933
Now they pretty much
stick to the Green Zone

07:55.967 --> 07:58.967
and let the rest of us
rot down here.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.067
- And this is where
Charlie has been living.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.233
Will you help me find him?

08:04.267 --> 08:06.500
- Of course.

08:06.533 --> 08:07.667
You got any leads?

08:07.700 --> 08:09.167
- I think he's in a street gang,

08:09.200 --> 08:11.600
working for a warlord
named Solomon.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.067
- Oh, shit.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.500
- That bad?

08:14.533 --> 08:16.067
- At least he's
usually willing to deal.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.333
But we got to get
in his front door first.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.567
- How do we do that?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.767
- Go find someone.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.267
Just like old times.

Back up or you don't get any!
- Here it is, look!

08:32.233 --> 08:36.233
[indistinct chatter]

08:36.267 --> 08:39.667
- So sorry. We are out. We will
open up tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

You've been here
since the beginning.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.900

- An eventful ride.

10:16.367 --> 10:19.000
Tell me about the former members
of your team.

10:19.033 --> 10:22.100
- Will and Beau?

10:22.133 --> 10:25.000
It's my understanding Will got
a transit pass

10:25.033 --> 10:26.967
from former Proxy Snyder

10:27.000 --> 10:29.133
and went through the Wall.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.467
Beau seems to have disappeared.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.467
- What do you think happened
to him?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100

10:37.067 --> 10:38.633
- Do you have a theory?

10:38.667 --> 10:40.467
- No, sir.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.300
- I'm sure you understand
that their behavior might

10:47.333 --> 10:50.767
raise questions
about your own loyalty.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.767
I've been sent here
because this office has failed

10:53.800 --> 10:56.733
to live up to the standards
of the Authority.

10:56.767 --> 11:00.667
My job is to catch Broussard
and his fellow terrorists.

11:00.700 --> 11:04.900
We also must recover an object
that belongs to our Hosts,

11:04.933 --> 11:09.200
which means I need officers
I can trust.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.067

11:11.100 --> 11:13.133
you'll see what I can bring
to the team.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.333
- I understand the value
of continuity,

11:15.367 --> 11:18.533
so you will get the chance
to prove yourself.

11:18.567 --> 11:21.067
Otherwise, you'll be assigned

What we have to do is
remember the consequences

12:14.967 --> 12:17.533
if we stick our necks out
too far.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.267
He committed a crime.
- He's just a kid.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.067
- That kid went under the Wall.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.133
Anyway, if he gets sent
to the Factory,

12:26.167 --> 12:27.433
there's nothing I can do
about it.

let this happen?

either you or Hudson--
you're gonna need something,

12:35.467 --> 12:37.100

up the creek

12:37.133 --> 12:39.067

all our chips here.

Look. I'll do whatever I can
to help Bram.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.067
Just know that whatever I do,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.100
they can use it
to question our loyalty,

12:49.133 --> 12:53.367
and right now, we have
so many big things in the works.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.900
Your initiation ceremony
tomorrow.

that you're being welcomed

13:02.233 --> 13:03.867

13:03.900 --> 13:05.433

13:08.333 --> 13:10.800
Look. I know you love
your family.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.333
It's one of the things
I love about you.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.600
- Just...

13:23.333 --> 13:24.933
promise me...

13:24.967 --> 13:26.700
- Anything.
- That you will do

13:26.733 --> 13:29.700
everything you can
to keep Bram out of the Factory.

13:29.733 --> 13:32.267

You have my word.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.100
I promise.
- Okay.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.800
- What's the plan?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.667
- Solomon wants someone.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.533
We grab them.
You get your meeting.

13:50.567 --> 13:51.967
I get a reward.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.367
Works out for everyone.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.967
- You're a bounty hunter.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.833
- Same thing we used to do,
just without the badge.

13:57.867 --> 14:00.067
- Who's the target?
- A woman.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.333
Another guy tried
to pick her up.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.767
Didn't work out for him.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.100
- What--is she la femme Nikita?

14:04.133 --> 14:06.900
- Nah. Former teacher.
Preschool, I think.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.733
Her husband, on the other hand,
he has a bit of a temper.

14:10.967 --> 14:14.233
Go inside.
Say you want to see Jacobs.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.200
The target should be holed up
in apartment 2B.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.567
- You aren't coming with me?

14:20.600 --> 14:21.900
- No. The spotters will
recognize my face,

14:21.933 --> 14:23.333
and they'll warn her.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.733
I'll be two minutes after you.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.067
Oh, give me your gun.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.567
- What? Why?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.433
- In case you're searched.

14:30.467 --> 14:32.533
They'll think you're a
bounty hunter if you're packing.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.367
We need her alive.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.267
[dramatic music]

14:48.300 --> 14:55.267

15:03.067 --> 15:05.567

[muffled arguing]

15:13.733 --> 15:20.767

15:26.800 --> 15:28.267
- I'm looking for--

15:28.300 --> 15:30.633
[grunting]

[shouts in pain]

15:41.367 --> 15:47.400
*

15:47.433 --> 15:48.667
- Let him go!

15:48.700 --> 15:51.067
- Easy.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.267
- [cries out]
[Taser clicking]

15:56.967 --> 15:58.333
- Son of a bitch.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.067
Preschool teacher?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.633
- That's what I heard.
Jesus, when did you get so soft?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.133
- You can't sew for shit.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.700
[grunts]

16:18.200 --> 16:20.967
- Hey.
- Got the last one on your list.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.500
- Always glad
to close out the month.

16:23.533 --> 16:24.867
You get a partner?

16:24.900 --> 16:26.967
- Maybe. Just trying him out.

16:27.067 --> 16:29.533
- That's funny. I always saw you
as the lone wolf type.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.233
Bring her in.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.833
Happy hunting.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.900
- What's going on?

16:52.933 --> 16:54.333
- Step back, ma'am.

16:54.367 --> 16:57.733
- Yeah, I'm with Homeland.
This is my house.

17:00.167 --> 17:03.300
What is this?
I work for Homeland!

17:04.667 --> 17:08.300
Who ordered you
to search my house?

17:08.333 --> 17:09.533
- Did you find anything?

17:09.567 --> 17:10.867
- No. It's clean.

17:10.900 --> 17:14.067
- We're done.
Have a good night.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.233
- Let's wrap it up.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.800
- [scoffs]

17:23.667 --> 17:24.967
[sighs]

17:29.067 --> 17:32.100
[somber music]

17:48.333 --> 17:48.600
.

17:48.633 --> 17:49.700
- This is it.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.633
They're taking us
to the Factory.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.967
- You don't know that.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.200
- What did you do?

18:00.900 --> 18:02.300
- Went under the Wall.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.633
- Listen up!
We're removing your cuffs.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.133
Stay seated until you're ordered
off the bus.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.067
- [coughing]

18:17.067 --> 18:18.600
- What did you do in the bloc?

18:18.633 --> 18:20.733
- I worked on a road crew.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.100
- And you?

18:26.133 --> 18:27.767
- I teach high school.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.200
- Get back on the bus.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.300
- No, no, I have skills. I can--
[grunts]

18:34.600 --> 18:36.067
- Get him out of here.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.400
- How old are you?
- 20.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.367
- What did you do on the bloc?
- Construction.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.100
- What kind of construction?

18:49.133 --> 18:52.100
- Demo, mostly. But my last job
was laying concrete.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.067
[dramatic music]

19:07.067 --> 19:08.500
- Move it!

19:08.533 --> 19:10.167
- Go on now.
- Let's go, come on!

19:10.200 --> 19:18.067
*

19:18.067 --> 19:19.167
- Right here.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.967
Three right here.
Let's go.

19:25.067 --> 19:28.700
*

19:28.733 --> 19:29.833
Pick it up. Let's go!

19:29.867 --> 19:34.300
*

19:34.333 --> 19:37.167
- You have been assigned to one
of the Authority's labor camps

19:37.200 --> 19:39.700
and distribution centers.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.933
We are responsible
for making sure

19:41.967 --> 19:45.333
supplies reach
their correct destination.

19:45.367 --> 19:47.533
If you break a rule,

19:47.567 --> 19:49.600
if you steal anything...

19:52.133 --> 19:53.367
I will hurt you.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.967
And if you do it again,
you will go to the Factory.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.633
Remember:

20:03.667 --> 20:05.700
we are always watching.

20:10.933 --> 20:13.333
[dog barking in distance]

20:19.167 --> 20:20.600
- What are you doing here?

20:20.633 --> 20:22.667
- I want to see Solomon.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.933
[man in distance]
- Get your hands off me!

20:26.800 --> 20:28.500
- [exhales sharply]

20:29.833 --> 20:31.300
Come on.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.300
Keep coming.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.000
Weapons in the box.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.500
Come on.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.300
You look familiar.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.433
- Yeah. You stabbed me.

20:48.467 --> 20:49.933
- Oh yeah.
[chuckles]

20:53.300 --> 20:54.833
- No hard feelings.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.533
- Hey. Devon's got something
for you.

21:03.567 --> 21:04.767
- There's my girl.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.333
Did you bring me
something nice?

21:11.733 --> 21:14.400
You are a goddamn bloodhound.

21:14.433 --> 21:15.900
Quota keeps going up.

21:15.933 --> 21:18.067
You are gonna be
rolling in business.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.600
And who the hell is he?

21:22.633 --> 21:23.933
- He wants to trade.

21:23.967 --> 21:25.733
- What kind of trade?

21:28.067 --> 21:29.933
- My son Charlie.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.667
I lost him during the Arrival.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.667
- That's a sad story.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.067
- I heard he might be running
in one of your gangs.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.567
- Well, he's a good looking boy.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.267
But I meet a lot of people.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.700
- I've got a transit pass.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.167
- Then show me.

22:01.433 --> 22:04.467
Hm.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.100
You know, what's to stop me
from just killing you

22:08.133 --> 22:09.567
and keeping the pass?

22:09.600 --> 22:11.633
- Because it'd be bad
for business.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.433
People come to you knowing
that you'll make a fair trade.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.900
- See, that's the thing. I--

22:16.933 --> 22:18.767
I think I'd be losing
on the deal.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.333
I mean, sure, this valuable,

22:20.367 --> 22:23.933
but your son Charlie--
he's a very special kid.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.833
- Do you know where he is?

22:25.867 --> 22:27.400
- Sure.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.767
I know everything there is
to know about your boy.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.600
He's got the face of an angel
and the heart of a thief.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.500
He's been one of my best
performers.

22:38.933 --> 22:40.267
Of course,
it wasn't always like that.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.567
He was a very--

22:42.600 --> 22:44.833
well, he's got
a mind of his own.

22:44.867 --> 22:46.233
We had to break him of that.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.600
- Do we have a deal?

22:58.367 --> 23:00.300
- Are you angry?

23:02.167 --> 23:03.333
Huh.

23:06.067 --> 23:09.067
Well, ask yourself a question,
tough guy.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.700
Where have you been
for the last year?

23:13.067 --> 23:15.700
Your son would've died on the
streets if it wasn't for me.

23:18.167 --> 23:20.967
So I'd like to hear
a little goddamn gratitude.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.067
And then maybe we can
make a deal.

23:27.867 --> 23:31.067
- If I get to see my boy,

23:31.100 --> 23:33.500
I'd be grateful to you
for the rest of my life.

23:41.267 --> 23:44.133
- Dino,

23:44.167 --> 23:45.367
where's Charlie?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.133
- In the alley,

23:47.167 --> 23:48.533
near 28th.

23:51.067 --> 23:53.733
- In the alley near 28th.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.833
Hey. A little word to the wise:

23:56.867 --> 23:59.467
the street changes a kid.

23:59.500 --> 24:03.467
So don't blame him if he doesn't
want to go with you.

24:04.567 --> 24:11.600
*

24:15.733 --> 24:16.933
- No.
No, please.

24:16.967 --> 24:18.533
Please don't!

24:18.567 --> 24:21.400
[screams]
Help! Somebody!

24:21.433 --> 24:22.700
[whimpers]
Help me!

24:22.733 --> 24:25.100
[scuffling]

24:25.133 --> 24:26.467
- Charlie!

24:35.100 --> 24:42.133

25:08.067 --> 25:08.300

25:08.333 --> 25:11.233
[dialing phone]

25:12.633 --> 25:15.667
[phone ringing]

25:18.533 --> 25:19.833
- Hello?

25:19.867 --> 25:22.800
- Katie, I have good news.

25:22.833 --> 25:25.467
- Thank God.
I've been dying.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.900
- Nolan managed to get Bram
off the bus to the Factory

25:28.933 --> 25:30.900
and transferred
into a labor camp.

25:32.067 --> 25:33.900
- That's the good news?

25:33.933 --> 25:36.233
- It's outside the walls,
but not too far.

25:36.267 --> 25:40.900
And it's not the Factory.

25:40.933 --> 25:42.833
- Mad, I got to get him back.

25:42.867 --> 25:45.067
- I know.

25:45.067 --> 25:48.067
I promise Nolan is doing
everything he can.

25:48.067 --> 25:50.733
But it might take a while.

25:53.267 --> 25:55.533
- You just need to be patient,
okay?

25:57.633 --> 25:58.733
- Okay.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.133
Thank you.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.733
[somber music]

26:04.767 --> 26:07.967
*

26:08.067 --> 26:09.867
- Was that about Bram?

26:09.900 --> 26:11.867
- Yeah.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.567
He's gonna be okay.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.633
We just--

26:18.667 --> 26:21.900
we might not see him
for a little while.

26:21.933 --> 26:23.933
- Why? What is he doing?

26:23.967 --> 26:27.900
- He has to work
outside the Walls.

26:29.367 --> 26:31.533
- Is he helping prepare
for the Greatest Day?

26:34.433 --> 26:38.367
- Why are you so interested
in the Greatest Day?

26:40.267 --> 26:42.767
- Lindsay says working to
prepare for the Greatest Day is

26:42.800 --> 26:44.233
what makes you a good person.

26:46.733 --> 26:48.467
- You don't need Lindsay

26:48.500 --> 26:51.467
or the Greatest Day

26:51.500 --> 26:53.400
to be good, love.

26:56.367 --> 26:59.400
- I thought that maybe Daddy
and Bram haven't been

26:59.433 --> 27:04.133
coming home because I haven't
been working hard enough.

27:05.433 --> 27:06.967
- Of course not.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.633
Hey. Look at me.

27:12.467 --> 27:15.067
This is not your fault.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.200
- Then whose fault is it?

27:24.467 --> 27:26.600
- You excited
to see Bram and Gracie?

27:29.233 --> 27:30.367
- I guess.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.833
- We're in a new house.

27:33.867 --> 27:36.667
But we moved over
all your stuff.

27:36.700 --> 27:37.833
You even got your own room.

27:45.433 --> 27:46.800
Did someone hurt you?

27:49.933 --> 27:51.633
Charlie?

27:51.667 --> 27:53.067
- I'm fine.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.733
- Okay.

28:00.767 --> 28:02.067
I'll let you eat.

28:05.300 --> 28:11.933
*

28:11.967 --> 28:13.900
- Kids are resilient.

28:13.933 --> 28:15.567
You just have to give it time.

28:17.300 --> 28:18.500
- Yeah.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.900
The guy at the pen said
they were closing out a month.

28:23.933 --> 28:25.767
And then Solomon mentioned
a quota,

28:25.800 --> 28:27.367
which apparently keeps going up.

28:29.067 --> 28:30.833
You know something.

28:30.867 --> 28:32.600
- It's just rumors.

28:32.633 --> 28:36.900
Supposedly the warlord
and the Occupation made a deal.

28:36.933 --> 28:38.433
As long as the warlords
turn over a certain number

28:38.467 --> 28:39.767
of people every month,

28:39.800 --> 28:41.400
the Redhats don't mess
with them.

28:41.433 --> 28:42.767
- What happens to the people?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.067
They go to the Factory?

28:45.367 --> 28:47.700
Then why isn't this bloc at war?

28:47.733 --> 28:49.067
Why aren't people fighting
for their lives?

28:49.100 --> 28:51.667
- Like I said,
it's just rumors.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.367
Nobody knows the truth.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.600
- If you strip away
the bullshit,

28:56.633 --> 28:58.100
is that the Occupation
really wants?

28:58.133 --> 29:00.800
A constant stream of people
for the Factory?

29:00.833 --> 29:02.567
- That's above my pay grade.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.767
I'm just trying to stay alive.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.233
- Why didn't you tell me
the truth about the pen?

29:11.267 --> 29:12.633
- 'Cause I knew you'd be
all conflicted

29:12.667 --> 29:14.100
about turning over that woman

29:14.133 --> 29:15.600
if you knew she was going
to the Factory.

29:15.633 --> 29:17.733
It was the only way
we could get to Solomon.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.967
- I'm not the man I was.

29:23.067 --> 29:26.567
I learned you got to do things
to survive in this world.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.433
Make compromises.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.167
- Yeah.

29:34.933 --> 29:38.067
[whirring]

29:38.100 --> 29:40.467
[birds chirping]

29:40.500 --> 29:42.600
[rattling]

29:42.633 --> 29:44.167
- Hey!
- What do you think--

29:44.200 --> 29:46.167
[grunting]
- [gasps]

29:46.200 --> 29:48.633
Charlie! Charlie!

29:48.667 --> 29:49.967
- Come here!
What do you think you're doing

29:50.067 --> 29:51.267
stealing stuff, huh?
- Get off of me!

29:51.300 --> 29:54.100
- Charlie!
- Stop it!

29:54.133 --> 29:55.500
- He tried to run away.

29:56.967 --> 29:58.167
- What?

30:11.733 --> 30:12.000
.

30:12.033 --> 30:14.767
- Were you trying to go back
to Solomon?

30:15.833 --> 30:16.200
- Of course he was.
That explains why Solomon was

30:17.000 --> 30:17.700
so quick to make that trade
with us.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.533
- Why? Why would you want
to go back there?

30:20.567 --> 30:21.700
- Look at his ankle.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.133
- Come here. Come here.

30:28.067 --> 30:30.067
What are those?
- Nothing!

30:30.100 --> 30:32.033
- It's not nothing.
- I tried to run away.

30:32.067 --> 30:33.933
Solomon put me on the chain.
I learned.

30:36.333 --> 30:38.100
- What else did he do to you?

30:38.133 --> 30:41.100
[soft music]

30:41.133 --> 30:44.900
*

30:44.933 --> 30:47.367
I came to take you home,
Charlie.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.967
You're never going
back to that place--

30:49.000 --> 30:50.700
- Solomon told me I had to go
back or he'll hurt me.

30:50.733 --> 30:52.133
- He won't hurt you.
I won't let him.

30:52.167 --> 30:53.767
- He'll hurt my friends.
- No, he won't.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.267
I won't let anything happen
to your friends.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.400
- Then he'll hurt you!
- No, he won't.

30:57.433 --> 30:58.933
Charlie.

31:02.133 --> 31:04.600
I can take care of myself.

31:04.633 --> 31:06.800
I'll be right back.
You'll be safe here with Devon.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.167
- Hey. No.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.200
[gun clicks]

31:11.233 --> 31:13.333
Are you
out of your goddamn mind?

31:13.367 --> 31:15.333
What's gonna happen to Charlie
if you get yourself killed?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.533
- Watch the kid.

31:37.167 --> 31:38.200
- Nolan.

31:39.833 --> 31:41.467
- Katie.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.067
Is this an ambush?

31:44.800 --> 31:46.800
- If it was an ambush,
I'd be wearing a mask.

31:46.833 --> 31:48.200
[laughs]

31:48.233 --> 31:51.700
- It's all right.
Give us a second.

31:51.733 --> 31:55.167
- I--I wanted to talk to you
about Bram.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.067
- I can't tell you how sorry I
was to hear about his situation.

31:58.067 --> 31:59.867
- Thank you.
I just wondered

31:59.900 --> 32:04.100
if there was anything else
that you can do for him.

32:04.133 --> 32:06.700
- Maddie didn't talk to you?
- She did.

32:06.733 --> 32:11.367
I just--I thought maybe
if I spoke with you directly--

32:11.400 --> 32:14.100
- I made a lot of calls, Katie.

32:14.133 --> 32:18.400
And the bottom line is
if Bram behaves himself,

32:18.433 --> 32:22.567
he'll be transferred back
eventually.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.433
I'm really sorry that there's
nothing more I can do.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.733
It's just--it's above my head.

32:26.767 --> 32:29.200
- I think there is more
that you could do.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.867
I think you don't want to.

32:32.633 --> 32:34.067
- Do I need to remind you

32:34.100 --> 32:36.167
your son got himself
into this situation?

32:36.200 --> 32:41.067
- By going under a wall
that aliens put up to pen us in.

32:41.067 --> 32:42.733
That's a crime?
He's a kid.

32:46.167 --> 32:49.500
- I'll be praying for the safe
reunification of your family.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.567
Have a great day.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.433

- Keep moving.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.167

33:33.200 --> 33:35.333
- Come on, keep moving.

33:35.367 --> 33:38.333
[indistinct chatter]

33:58.967 --> 34:01.233
- Hey. Do you want to come eat
with my friends?

34:01.267 --> 34:02.467
- Sure.

34:12.667 --> 34:15.067
- This is the guy
I was telling you about.

34:15.067 --> 34:16.533
The one that snuck
under the Wall.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.833
- How'd you get under the Wall?

34:23.533 --> 34:26.067
- Guard's coming.
- Shut up!

34:26.067 --> 34:27.900
[indistinct whispering]

[tense music]

34:34.067 --> 34:35.133
[loud thump]

34:36.867 --> 34:39.067
- One of my guys saw him
steal it from the docks.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.467
- You're willing
to go to the Factory

34:43.500 --> 34:44.967
for a screwdriver?

34:48.433 --> 34:49.667
- Let's go.

34:55.800 --> 35:02.900
*

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
[knocking at door]

35:21.333 --> 35:23.233
- How dare you?

35:23.267 --> 35:24.467
- What?

35:26.700 --> 35:29.100
- You went behind my back
to Nolan.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.633
- No, Maddie.
It wasn't like that.

35:30.667 --> 35:32.300
It was--it wasn't like that.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.100
- What if I did something
like that to you and Will?

35:34.133 --> 35:35.100
How would you feel?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.267
- I'm sorry.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.233
I'm desperate.

35:38.267 --> 35:39.700
- Do you not trust me?

35:39.733 --> 35:41.767
Or do you just not understand
boundaries?

35:44.933 --> 35:46.467
I deserve an answer.

35:48.533 --> 35:49.767
- Maybe I didn't believe

35:49.800 --> 35:51.933
that you would push Nolan
hard enough.

35:53.833 --> 35:55.600
- Nolan can protect us

35:55.633 --> 35:57.400
because he knows
how to play the game.

35:57.433 --> 35:59.067
He is gonna help Bram--
- That's what I'm talking about.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.067
- He just has to be smart--
- It's a game to Nolan.

36:01.067 --> 36:03.200
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Katie,
this isn't about you!

36:03.233 --> 36:04.700
You run around doing
whatever you want,

36:04.733 --> 36:06.067
and damn the consequences.

36:06.067 --> 36:07.767
- I'm trying
to keep my family together!

36:07.800 --> 36:09.433
- How's that working out
for you?

36:11.067 --> 36:14.100
This. This is why you're alone.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.500
I--I'm gonna send Gracie
back down to you.

36:30.733 --> 36:30.967
.

36:31.067 --> 36:33.667
- You are about to enter
a select group.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.833
The question for humanity is not
where we have been.

36:36.867 --> 36:38.200
It's where we are going.

36:38.233 --> 36:40.533
Are you prepared
to accept that truth?

36:40.567 --> 36:42.500
- Yes, I am.

36:42.533 --> 36:46.067
- Will you safeguard the secrets
of our movement,

36:46.067 --> 36:48.367
even from friends and family?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.067
And do you accept
that the punishment

36:50.067 --> 36:52.467
for violating you oaths

36:52.500 --> 36:54.300
will fall not just upon you,

36:54.333 --> 36:56.833
but upon everyone you love?

36:56.867 --> 36:59.367
- I do.
- Then rise, Maddie Kenner,

36:59.400 --> 37:01.933
and receive your welcome
into the Greatest Day.

37:05.267 --> 37:07.300

[blues music playing]

38:40.467 --> 38:41.833
- Jennifer.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.967
- You need to work for me.

38:49.067 --> 38:50.500
- What?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.633
- I know what you've been doing,

38:53.667 --> 38:55.100
and I have the evidence.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.167
Lots of it.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.600
- Please lower your voice.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.100
- Will basically admitted it,
you know,

39:01.133 --> 39:02.833
before he went through the Wall

39:02.867 --> 39:05.233
or whatever the hell he did.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.067
- Drink that.

39:20.967 --> 39:24.267
- What is it with you and Will
and the whiskey?

39:24.300 --> 39:25.933
Why can't you drink something
that doesn't taste

39:25.967 --> 39:27.067
like lighter fluid?

39:27.067 --> 39:29.100
- What do you want from me?

39:29.133 --> 39:30.533
- Broussard.

39:32.733 --> 39:34.200
- I have no contact with him.

39:34.233 --> 39:35.500
- I don't believe you.

39:35.533 --> 39:36.933
- But it's true.

39:36.967 --> 39:39.833
And if I try and reach out
to him,

39:39.867 --> 39:41.833
he will know
that I've been compromised.

39:41.867 --> 39:44.200
- And it's gonna fall on you.

39:48.533 --> 39:51.100
- I've made mistakes.

39:51.133 --> 39:52.700
God knows.

39:52.733 --> 39:55.700
Right now,
I just want to be a mother

39:55.733 --> 39:58.600
to the one child I have left.

39:58.633 --> 40:00.067
I know that you and Will
were friends.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.567
I know he trusted you.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.033
Please don't destroy
what remains of his family.

[dog barks in distance]

Lookit, lookit.

40:17.633 --> 40:19.200
What's up, man?

40:19.233 --> 40:20.867
Did you lose another kid?

40:20.900 --> 40:22.533
- I'm here to see Solomon.
