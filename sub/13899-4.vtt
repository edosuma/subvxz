00:05.830 --> 00:07.300
How does anybody ever
read this crap?

00:07.840 --> 00:08.210
Hey Leslie!

00:09.630 --> 00:11.590
I was thinking maybe we should
take the day off and

00:11.630 --> 00:13.970
go for a --
a jaunt up the

00:14.010 --> 00:14.930
shore or--

00:14.970 --> 00:16.140
And hear me out on this--

00:16.180 --> 00:17.510
We could just --

00:19.970 --> 00:21.430
stay here and make out.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.850
Jake, b'y.
Sometimes I wonder

00:22.890 --> 00:24.560
if that's the only
thing you ever think about.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.020
That's not the only thing
I thinks about.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.940
For example, what
I'm thinking right now,

00:27.980 --> 00:30.150
is I'm imagining that towel
of yours should just

00:30.190 --> 00:32.490
fall off to the floor.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.570
Well.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.660
I thought we should probably
slow things down a bit.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.990
You know. Especially considering
almost getting pregnant and all.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.580
Or, and hear me
out on this again.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.420
We could go in the
opposite direction.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.500
We could speed things up,
and, you know,

00:46.540 --> 00:50.510
try and make our own
little tiny human people.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.720
You're crazy.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.560
What's so crazy about two people
in love wanting to have babies?

01:02.310 --> 01:03.230
I can't.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.770
I can't, uh.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.480
I can't miss work today.
I got a woman

01:06.520 --> 01:08.190
on the No-Fly list
who arrived last night.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.230
It's an important
assignment.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.730
I don't like
the sounds of that.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.900
I'm a big girl. I know
how to do my job.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.280
I'm a police woman. I
fight bad guys, remember?

01:15.320 --> 01:16.860
Hey, I'm just saying that,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.570
you know, I think we would
have pretty cool kids

01:19.620 --> 01:21.870
Obviously, I bring the average
down a lot, but--

01:22.790 --> 01:24.210
You more than make up for it.

01:26.710 --> 01:28.080
- I'm going. I'm going.

01:29.210 --> 01:30.750
- Yeah?
- [Rose] Hey Jake.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.130
Have you seen your father?

01:32.170 --> 01:34.050
He went to get breakfast
an hour ago.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.880
You know, maybe he just
forgot where he lives.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.550
He is getting older now.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.140
You know, in fact, We should
probably just tag him.

01:39.510 --> 01:40.800
Jake.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.770
Alright. I'll look into it.
I'll give him a buzz

01:42.810 --> 01:44.100
and see where he is.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.560
Thank you. And let me know
if you hear anything.

This should only take
a few minutes.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.420
I really don't understand the
problem, Sergeant Bennett.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.630
I'm only on the No-Fly list
in the States.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.880
That may be true.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.310
I just wanted
to have a chat.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.390
See what you're doing in town.

03:09.430 --> 03:10.810
Well, that seems
a little prejudicial.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.610
I'm just here for a conference.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.480
In and out in three days.
Purely business.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.860
It says here you work for a
computer security company.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.240
I'm the head of the company.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.610
So. There's no reason to
suspect an incident

03:21.660 --> 03:23.320
like the one
in Chicago

03:23.370 --> 03:24.320
would happen here.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.870
I wasn't responsible
for Chicago.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.790
So you've got nothing
to worry about.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.080
You buy her story?

03:31.120 --> 03:32.580
Elaine's hiding
something.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.250
But we got nothing
to hold her on.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.880
You're right.
But keep some eyes on her.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.670
We can't take any chances
with someone like that.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.890
Hey. I could use some help.
You guys interested?

03:42.930 --> 03:42.970
For sure.

We're actually working on

[Tinny]
We can do that anytime.

03:47.390 --> 03:48.720
What did you have in mind,
Sergeant?

03:48.770 --> 03:49.890
A little surveillance.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.450
Okay boys.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.250
Argh!

04:10.540 --> 04:14.040
Oh! That hurt. Did you
have to get physical?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.290
Was that necessary?

04:15.330 --> 04:16.250
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.840
Extreme?

04:17.880 --> 04:19.460
You knocked me out and threw me
in the trunk of my own car.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.630
Now it's your turn.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.550
What are you gonna
do with that?

04:23.590 --> 04:25.090
There's no time to
explain, here.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.300
A man's life is in danger.

We can save a man's life

What the hell
are you talking about? Who?

04:29.890 --> 04:31.640
I don't know. Some guy
in a black SUV.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.440
I didn't really get a name.
And it doesn't matter.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.560

die right here

04:36.980 --> 04:37.020

something about it.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.360
You just happened upon an
assassination plot?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.280
- Yeah!
- And you decide to

04:41.320 --> 04:42.570
knock us out
and drag us here.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.200
Exactly. Finally. Yes.
And given our history--

04:45.240 --> 04:47.490
I didn't know if you guys would
come willingly. So...

04:47.530 --> 04:49.410
Something we agree on.
Jake. Let's go.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.870
Wait, wait, wait.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.290
I'll play along.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.830
How did you get
this information?

04:54.870 --> 04:57.880
Well I can't really divulge
anything like that.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.010
Suffice it to say, it's from
a very reliable source.

05:02.590 --> 05:03.970
Okay. The source is me.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.890
I was the one that was
hired to take out this target.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.100
So you - Crazy
McCrazy--

05:09.140 --> 05:10.760
All of a sudden
you're a hit man now.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.230
Yeah.
No, no, not hit--

05:13.270 --> 05:15.600
Look-- I took the
money for the hit.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.520
But I wasn't gonna
execute the hit.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.480
You understand?

05:18.520 --> 05:20.520
Murder for hire, Martin?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.190
This is the worst thing
you've ever done.

05:22.230 --> 05:23.240
And I have a list.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.570
Lemma tell you.
Okay, Now--

05:24.610 --> 05:25.820
I'm not the only guy
that's hired

05:25.860 --> 05:27.320
to take this
particular target out.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.910
And any of the other guys
show up here,

05:28.950 --> 05:30.240
who did take the gig,

05:30.280 --> 05:32.290
I'm sure they haven't got
the same moral compass--

05:32.330 --> 05:34.960
The same sense of social
responsibility I do that--

05:35.460 --> 05:36.500

05:36.540 --> 05:39.040
See? I wasn't lying.
That's the guy.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.550

I think I just saw

05:41.590 --> 05:42.880

05:42.920 --> 05:44.130
out of that open window.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.760
[Mal]
Perfect perch for a sniper.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
Okay, you go check on that.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.300
I'll try to warn our
would-be target.

05:48.340 --> 05:49.390
I'll stick with Jake.

05:49.430 --> 05:50.350
Hey.

05:50.390 --> 05:51.600
- What? Ow!
- Nice try.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.310
But I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.350
You might wanna
get back in your car.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.560
Look. I don't know
what your game is,

05:57.600 --> 05:59.440
but you better
push on right now.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.360
Okay, look. This sounds
weird. I get that.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.320
But your life might
be in danger.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.150
Turn around and walk
away or your life

06:05.190 --> 06:07.030
will be in danger.
You got me?

06:07.070 --> 06:09.200
Martin.
Is this a scam?

06:09.240 --> 06:11.660
No. It's not a scam.
I'm surprised at you.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.080
That's kind of
off side.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.040
See?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.920
You know what? You're big
enough to take care of yourself.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.210
So...

06:22.920 --> 06:24.590
- Wait a minute.
- Hey.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.840
Why do you have a picture
of Leslie Bennett?

Well, I am.

are you doing?

06:54.620 --> 06:56.040
Why are you double
crossing me like this?

06:56.080 --> 06:57.120
This isn't what we agreed.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.750
You double crossed
me first, Martin.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.630
- I what?
- This is payback.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.920
[Martin]
Malachy?

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
You okay?

07:06.260 --> 07:06.960
What?

07:07.670 --> 07:08.170
You know the sniper?

07:09.180 --> 07:11.220
Okay.
This is your last chance.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.680
Tell me what's going on.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.640
Okay, Mal.
Don't lose your temper.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.720
It's not good for your health.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.310
I mighta hired the guy.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.440
What are you doing here?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.490
We got a call about shots
being fired.

07:31.530 --> 07:32.910
That's pretty accurate.
Look-- I'm on a case.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.370
It's a long story,
but--

07:34.410 --> 07:36.740
this fella -- It appears
he was a target.

07:37.910 --> 07:39.000
He had
a picture of you.

07:40.370 --> 07:41.960
Me?
Any idea who he was?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.080
He's about this tall, black
jacked, beardy face.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.210
Are you describing yourself?

07:45.250 --> 07:45.920
No. Look --

07:47.000 --> 07:48.590
Whatever's
going on with this guy.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.970
I can't help but feel that
maybe, maybe you're in danger.

07:52.550 --> 07:53.680
Jake. Stop it.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.970
I get the drill.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.310
But you're a good cop.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.760
And you've caused some serious

07:57.810 --> 07:58.520
problems for some bad people
over the years.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.390
Jake. If I worried about every
criminal I put behind bars,

08:02.440 --> 08:03.400
I'd lose my mind.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.900
[Mal] You subcontracted
out the hit?

08:06.940 --> 08:08.110
Whoa, whoa.

08:08.150 --> 08:10.150
Like I told you before Malachy.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.990
I wasn't involved
in any of this.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.950
Look. Definitely,
I was not gonna handle

08:14.990 --> 08:16.490
any of this by myself.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.160
I just wanted to grab the money

08:18.200 --> 08:19.910
and not end up
at the bottom of the harbor.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.370
The day isn't over yet.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.080
What the hell does this have
to do with Leslie Bennett?

08:23.120 --> 08:24.250
I'm not sure.

08:24.290 --> 08:27.090
All I knew about,
was the actual meeting.

08:27.130 --> 08:29.710
And like I told him, I was
just gonna grab the briefcase.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.170
What's in the case?

08:31.090 --> 08:32.470
Drugs. Probably.
Definitely.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.880
It's gotta be drugs.
You know what?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.760
This is all one big fat
misunderstanding.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.890
You got me
on this?

08:36.930 --> 08:38.600
I'm actually
the good guy here.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.020
It's always
a big misunderstanding

08:40.060 --> 08:40.970
when it comes to you, Martin.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.600
There she is!
Rosie,

08:42.640 --> 08:43.850
Where have you been?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.020
[Mal]
Misunderstanding?

08:46.060 --> 08:49.020
Rose. You're ex-husband is
moonlighting as a hit man.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.480
I think we should turn him in.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.610
[Jake] No, no, no. We're
not turning him in-

08:51.650 --> 08:53.190
Until we know who all
the players are.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.910
I got a feeling he's not
gonna talk to the cops.

08:54.950 --> 08:55.820
No.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.580
Okay, fine! I'll take him
back to the office.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.540
Keep him out of
trouble.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.540
See that's why I married her.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.750
That's why
we married her, right?

09:02.790 --> 09:04.500
The compassionate spirit.
Come on baby.

09:04.540 --> 09:05.870
No, no.
You're not going anywhere

09:05.920 --> 09:07.420
until we get some leads.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.000
Like where did you find
this hit man?

09:09.040 --> 09:12.050
I'll tell you again. I phone
this guy at the hotel--

09:12.090 --> 09:14.930
that hotel that's by the gas
station -- what's it called?

09:14.970 --> 09:16.380
The Delta.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.510
The Delta. I told him: You
gotta stop. But he wouldn't.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.430
He wouldn't stop.

09:24.310 --> 09:25.600
[Mal] I'm gonna check
with the front desk.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.350
Show them this photo of
Vinnie that Rose sent us.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.150
See if anyone's laid
eyes on him.

09:29.190 --> 09:30.900
Aright.
I'll check out the bar.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.780
- Of course you will.
- Ha, ha.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.000
[Jake]
Hmm. Carter Campbell.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.510
Age: twenty one. Eye color:
Black and blue.

09:53.550 --> 09:55.010
- Doesn't say that on there.
- Not yet.

09:55.050 --> 09:57.010
But you're buying drinks
for an underage girl.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.890
- Anything can happen.
- Really Jake?

09:59.510 --> 10:00.550
Stalk much?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.720
I'm gonna dumb
this down for you.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.350
Obviously because
you're really dumb.

10:03.390 --> 10:05.480
That girl is sixteen years old,
which makes her a minor,

10:05.520 --> 10:07.940
which really makes
me pissed off.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.730
And you're
a so-called adult.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.940
You're supposed
to know better.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.520
You really need to mind
your own bus--

10:12.570 --> 10:13.980
Aaa aaa aaa aaah.

10:14.030 --> 10:14.860
[slurred]
What are you doing?

10:14.900 --> 10:16.190
Sorry I can't understand you.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.530
It must be with this hook thing
through your lip.

10:18.570 --> 10:19.660
Now I think what you're
saying is I'm really sorry Jake.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.750
I promise, I'll never see Sloan
ever, ever again, right?

10:25.790 --> 10:27.920
Good. See? You're getting
smarter every second.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.920
Walk away.

10:31.080 --> 10:31.880
Thank you for that.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.290
That guy was my partner.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.710
We've been working a bunch of
convention guys all day.

10:36.340 --> 10:38.340
- You're stealing credit cards?
- It's all company accounts.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.590
These guys just blow their money
on booze anyways.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.680
Might as well spend it
towards a good cause.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.020
Me.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.060
Buddy.
Someone dropped that.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.140
Now, listen.
You're a good girl.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.850
Oh, my God.
Will you leave me alone?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.400
I don't need
a body guard.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.150
Sloan, you gotta stop
acting like this.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.980
Okay, dressing like a
twenty five year old

10:56.030 --> 10:57.360
and running around
with douchebags

10:57.400 --> 10:58.450
who are only
trying to make a score.

10:59.610 --> 11:01.820
This is all gonna end you
back up in juvie

11:01.870 --> 11:02.530
or worse.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.370
You're better than this.

11:05.120 --> 11:05.660
[Mal]
Sloan?

11:06.410 --> 11:06.870
What are you doing here?

11:07.790 --> 11:09.420
Getting lectured, apparently.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.080
Dad. Vinnie's here.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.670
With the missus
in the blue suit.

11:13.710 --> 11:13.790
Who's she?

11:15.050 --> 11:16.710
I don't know. I'll
have Des look into her.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.720
Maybe she's the one
who hired Martin.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.930
Either way, she looks
pretty pissed off.

11:22.970 --> 11:25.140
We need to put a tracker
on Vinnie.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.850
Agreed. He's the only one who
can lead us to our target.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.350
And if Leslie's
tangled up in all of this,

11:29.390 --> 11:31.060
I gotta find out how.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.900
Okay. But Vinnie knows
me from the sniper's perch.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.610
He thinks
I'm working with Martin.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.070
And he had a pretty good
look at you too.

11:40.610 --> 11:43.990
Oh my God.
I am sooo sorry.

11:46.620 --> 11:47.740
Did she just--?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.290
Yeah. I think she did.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.830
Vinnie Walsh, the man Martin
hired to take out the target.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.590
- A traitor and a turncoat.
- Well, can you blame him?

11:57.630 --> 11:59.590
You did say you only paid Vinnie
a thousand bucks.

11:59.630 --> 12:02.510
And Vinnie has a previous
attempted murder charge

12:02.550 --> 12:03.590
and he never served
any time for it.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.600
Where did you find him Martin?

12:04.640 --> 12:05.890
On the interweb.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.850
I goggled him.
That's where I get

12:07.890 --> 12:09.560
everything these days.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.140
What about the target?
Did you get a name?

12:11.180 --> 12:13.350
I took forever and a day.
A good day, anyway.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.730
But I did a reverse image
search, and I got a hit.

12:15.770 --> 12:17.020
- Callum Pardy.
- That's the guy.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.980
That's the guy
I was hired to take out.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.610
That's the poor old
fella right there.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.360
Martin. This is a new low.
Even for you.

12:22.990 --> 12:24.570
You take a hit job.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.530
Then you subcontract it out just
to clear your warped conscience,

12:27.580 --> 12:28.490
which it doesn't,
by the way.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.830
Well, what could I do?

12:29.870 --> 12:31.960
I was in debt really bad.
So what I decided --

12:32.000 --> 12:35.250
I'd try my hand at an
honest man's work.

12:35.290 --> 12:36.580
I was doing
a little racketeering,

12:36.630 --> 12:38.590
a little point shaving,
some match fixing there.

12:39.340 --> 12:40.460
I mean, nothing illegal.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.800
They're all illegal.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.470
--ish.
Certainly frowned upon.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.010
Matter of opinion.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.930
But I guess a leopard
can't reverse...

12:47.970 --> 12:48.930
How does that
expression go?

12:48.970 --> 12:50.270
[Rose]
I don't care. Martin.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.020
Let's just put your issues
aside for the moment.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.890
We need to focus on this target.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.560
This Callum Pardy.
What do we know?

12:55.600 --> 12:55.730
I couldn't find
anything on him.

12:57.020 --> 12:58.860
There's no bank account.
There's no credit cards.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.530
And the SUV isn't
a rental.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.240
Okay. Well there's no paper
trail. That's unusual.

13:03.490 --> 13:06.450
Unusual? A drug dealer
who only uses cash?

13:06.490 --> 13:07.160
Never heard of that.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.240
Okay. Fine. So...

13:10.280 --> 13:12.950
One drug dealer hires you to
take out another drug dealer?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.870
Oh, Rosie. It does
kind of make sense.

13:14.910 --> 13:17.670
Eliminate the competition.
That's Business 101.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.880
Which I aced by the way.
No big deal.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.090
[ring]
I'm just saying you don't

13:21.130 --> 13:23.090
have to be some cool cop
to know everything.

13:24.840 --> 13:25.890
I hate Grayson.

13:26.930 --> 13:28.260
- Hey Mal.
- Rose?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.560
Did you get anything from
Martin on the target?

13:30.600 --> 13:30.970
No. Not yet.
But--

13:32.560 --> 13:35.690
Des managed to find a name.
Callum Pardy. Ring any bells?

13:35.730 --> 13:37.350
No. Nothing.
What's his background?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.480
Well see, that's the thing.
We can't find one.

13:39.400 --> 13:39.570
[Jake] Okay. Stay on it.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.480
We're tracking Vinnie.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.070
Looks like he's headed
to Pleasant Street.

13:43.110 --> 13:43.990
Okay.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.160
I think I might get
a drink downstairs.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.620
Get a real drink.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.830
Maybe a pint of beer
or something like that.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.040
Anybody wanna
join me?

13:53.080 --> 13:53.660
No?

13:54.960 --> 13:58.380
You know? I sense some
serious regret in him.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.210
Or maybe he just needs
some time alone. You know?

14:02.250 --> 14:02.960
To really think about
what he's done.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.880
Yeah. Or he's headed
for that briefcase.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.800
Right. Hopefully
filled with regret.

14:09.850 --> 14:10.930
Let's follow him.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.180
[Jake]
There's the SUV.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.140
Any sign of Vinnie?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.020
No.
Something's not right.

14:20.480 --> 14:20.650
[Jake]
There he is.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.190
Are you just gonna
let him get kidnapped?

14:24.320 --> 14:25.570
[Jake]
Well, as tempting as that is,

14:25.610 --> 14:27.450
I don't think we can.
In fact...

14:29.660 --> 14:30.740
I got a plan.

14:31.490 --> 14:32.830
It's gonna involve this.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.460
[Jake] Hey there,
Hitman. Long time no--

14:36.500 --> 14:37.750
shoot.

14:37.790 --> 14:39.420
I don't know who you are,
but you're in my way.

14:39.460 --> 14:42.540
I'm here to tell you that Martin
has called off the hit. Alright?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.920
So technically,
you're fired.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.630
I don't work for that lying
ball sack anymore.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.220
Well, he is a ball sack.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.550
But let me ask, are you working
for this missus in the suit?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.680
I was just wondering
the same thing.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.810
What the hell is he doing here?

15:00.850 --> 15:02.020
You're coming with me.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.190
Not without me,
he's not.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.860
Key?

15:10.910 --> 15:11.820
Get in the van.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.910
Now.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.130
Martin? What do you
think you're doing?

15:21.540 --> 15:22.250
Nothing.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.460
Actually I
did pretty good here.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.300
Look at this.
One try and I was right in.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.920
Nice work.
I mean, that's bad.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.930
Martin, we are trying
to protect you

15:31.970 --> 15:33.430
and you keep putting
yourself in danger.

15:33.470 --> 15:34.930
Just trying to right
the wrongs, Rosie.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.970
With another wrong. I
been there, Martin.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.230
Okay, let's go. Now,
now, now.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.770
You know,
had this handled.

15:41.810 --> 15:42.770
Now we're both
gonna get killed

15:42.810 --> 15:44.020
and it's gonna be
all your fault.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.360
Oh yeah. You seemed
really on top of it

15:45.400 --> 15:46.650
as you were being
dragged to the van.

15:46.690 --> 15:48.110
What are you gonna do
for you next trick?

15:48.150 --> 15:49.320
Slip into a coma?

15:52.490 --> 15:54.530
[tires spin]

15:55.830 --> 15:57.330
Always have a spare
handcuff key.

15:57.370 --> 15:58.950
You know what? You should
be writing this stuff down.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.160
You have no idea what you're
getting in the middle of.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.370
Why don't you educate me?
And while you're at it,

16:03.420 --> 16:05.540
tell me what it all has to do
with Leslie Bennett?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.590
I’m not telling you
you anything.

16:11.630 --> 16:12.840
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna need to know.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.090
And I'm gonna have to find out,

16:14.140 --> 16:15.800
whether I gotta kick
the crap outa you or not.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.180
Give me my cuffs back.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.310
Don't forget your key.

16:24.190 --> 16:25.190
Police. Don't move.

16:28.690 --> 16:29.650
Callum?

16:29.690 --> 16:30.400
[bang]

16:30.860 --> 16:32.860
[crash]

16:39.950 --> 16:40.830
Leslie!

16:44.210 --> 16:45.580
Oof!

16:47.630 --> 16:48.500
[Jake]
Leslie!

16:49.500 --> 16:51.130
Leslie. Leslie.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.600
We got an officer down--

16:58.350 --> 16:59.260
--on Pleasant Street.

17:16.780 --> 17:17.450
[Jake]
Oh God.

17:18.030 --> 17:18.990
Are you okay?

17:19.450 --> 17:20.330
Leslie?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.410
Oh thank God
you were wearing a vest.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.580
He was aiming for my head.
I owe you.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.290
Oh man, if anything had
happened to you.

17:29.340 --> 17:34.050
Come on. Nice and easy.
I got you.

17:34.090 --> 17:34.970
I got you.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.510
Where is everyone?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.100
Well Vinnie.
Vinnie's over there.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.150
I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:48.060 --> 17:48.480
I swear to God--

17:49.520 --> 17:50.860
I don't know what
I would have done

17:50.900 --> 17:51.690
if anything had happened to you.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.110
Jake. I'm good.
Where's Callum?

17:56.490 --> 17:59.370
Yeah. I don't know.
But speaking of Callum.

17:59.410 --> 18:00.700
I mean, not to
sound jealous,

18:00.740 --> 18:02.540
but you wanna tell me
who the hell he is?

18:02.580 --> 18:04.250
Jake. I can't talk
about that now.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.670
Is Leslie okay?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.800
The jury's still out
on that one.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.260
Constables.
I'll take it from here.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.430
I got two words for you.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.680
Martin Poole.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.320
Kinda seems like old times,
doesn't it?

18:31.900 --> 18:33.530
Deja friggin vu.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.360
Heh, heh!

18:35.280 --> 18:36.320
Rose.
What are you doing here?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.700
She's my lawyer.
My mouthpiece over here.

18:38.740 --> 18:38.910
You're here to defend him?

18:40.410 --> 18:43.030
Or, if you wanna put him jail.
I'm okay with that too.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.660
- No, you don't mean that.
- I do.

18:44.700 --> 18:44.910
She doesn't mean that.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.330
Rose. Can I see you in the hall,
for a second?

18:48.370 --> 18:50.000
- Sure.
- Be careful.

18:56.380 --> 18:57.130
[Martin]
Whoa. Whoa.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.670
We won't be needing those.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.550
Hey. I don't know what these
Doyles have been telling you.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.680
But I've pretty much been
a model citizen

19:03.720 --> 19:06.100
ever since my dark
days behind bars.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.190
Who hired you to kill
a dead man?

19:10.230 --> 19:11.440
Dead? What the hell are
you talking about?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.810
I was handcuffed
to the guy.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.030
Ha. Ha. Right. Very funny.
Unless he was a ghost.

19:16.070 --> 19:20.700
Or a zombie. Or like,
a ghost zombie?

19:20.740 --> 19:20.910
Des.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.330
Right. Okay. Well, right here,

19:24.370 --> 19:26.990
Mister Smarty Pants,
is a death certificate--

19:27.040 --> 19:30.210
Saying that Callum Pardy died
eight years ago.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.960
And it's pretty sad, okay?
Because he looks really young.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.750
Explains why we couldn't find
anything on him.

19:34.790 --> 19:37.840
No credit cards. Bank accounts.
Not even a parking ticket.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.380
What about our mystery lady.
Anything on her?

19:40.430 --> 19:41.720
Oh. Elaine Goodwin.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.800
A known associate
of black market smugglers--

19:43.850 --> 19:45.180
Guns, drugs, you
name it.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.470
So what's she doing in town?

19:46.510 --> 19:48.810
Well, she has
reinvented herself.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.140
And now runs a computer
security company,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.400
which is very interesting,
because her name

19:54.360 --> 19:56.320
is on the American No-Fly list.

19:56.360 --> 19:56.570
Wait a minute.

19:58.110 --> 20:01.150
Leslie's working some case
about a missus on a No-Fly list.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.570
Well, she's in town for
a conference, but--

20:04.620 --> 20:05.910
By the looks of it, she hasn't
been attending

20:05.950 --> 20:07.950
any of the sessions.
Oh, and--

20:07.990 --> 20:09.160
Check this out.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.460
That looks like the briefcase
that Callum was holding.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.340
Yeah. A traffic camera caught
Elaine with it.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.840
She must have followed
the hit man there.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.050
So she must have hired
him and Martin.

20:21.090 --> 20:24.220
Bingo. I checked Martin's
bank records.

20:24.260 --> 20:26.100
And money was transferred
from a numbered account

20:26.140 --> 20:29.600
belonging to...
Elaine Goodwin.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.100
So, if she has the briefcase,
what now?

20:32.810 --> 20:34.060
Heading out of town?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.770
Doesn't explain why
she has the briefcase

20:35.810 --> 20:37.480
or how Leslie's
tangled up in all of this.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.150
Leslie told you to
back off the case.

20:39.190 --> 20:40.440
Maybe we should take
her advice.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.860
She does carry a gun.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.490
Okay look. I know. But she could
have been killed today.

20:44.530 --> 20:45.820
And I can't back off.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.830
Not until I know
that she's safe.

20:47.870 --> 20:50.250
Yeah. We're with you there son.
So what now?

20:51.120 --> 20:52.540
Des, you check in the Delta.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.960
See if there's any sign of
Elaine checking in there.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.460
I'm on it.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.250
Jake, you and me. Let's go back
to where we saw Callum.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.960
He must have
a place there.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.720
You know, I think I might be

21:03.760 --> 21:07.430
actually more useful at this
point, if we started to initiate

21:07.470 --> 21:09.680
some discussion about what you
might be offering me

21:09.720 --> 21:12.600
in terms of witness protection.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.270
Now I don't require a mansion,
or anything like that.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.650
But a backyard and pool,
that would be nice.

21:17.690 --> 21:20.650
Okay. How's about this
for a deal.

21:20.690 --> 21:21.480
Okay shoot.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.990
You talk.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.990
And I don't turn you in for that
American warrant for theft

21:26.030 --> 21:27.280
I noticed was pending.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.040
I could have you extradited
in a second.

21:31.410 --> 21:34.620
And I got a feeling their
prisons aren't as nice.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.290
Okay, okay. Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.340
Relax. Sit down.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.300
I'll tell you something
here now.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.510
You got a lot more
in common with Jake Doyle

21:44.550 --> 21:46.220
than what you think.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.350
You're kinda tough.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.350
I found this in the back of

21:56.390 --> 21:58.310
Callum Pardy's SUV.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.730
Never seen it before,
so I'm figuring it's the--

22:01.150 --> 22:03.030
--the drug flavor of the week.
Something like that.

22:03.070 --> 22:05.150
I hope you're making inroads
and cracking down on it.

22:05.200 --> 22:05.780
This isn't drugs.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.320
It's not drugs?
What is it?

22:10.740 --> 22:13.540
Bennett. I didn't
know anyone was in here.

22:14.370 --> 22:15.370
What's going on?
You okay?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah. We're good.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.080
He doesn't know
anything.

22:19.540 --> 22:20.590
You good?

22:23.210 --> 22:23.840
[Jake] You see anything?

22:24.460 --> 22:25.130
[Mal] No.

22:25.670 --> 22:26.930
Who's that?

22:28.970 --> 22:29.850
Not sure.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.890
[knocking]

22:35.270 --> 22:36.600
[Mal]
Is that a salute?

22:37.480 --> 22:39.020
Is Callum military?

22:45.990 --> 22:46.860
[door bangs]

23:11.550 --> 23:14.010
Argh! Son of a bugger!

23:18.180 --> 23:19.230
[door lock opening]

23:28.440 --> 23:29.820
[phone rings]

23:31.740 --> 23:32.990
Surprise surprise.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.160
Once again Martin's
not telling us everything.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.160
He's rotten.
But that's his M.O.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.700
If Callum's military,

23:38.750 --> 23:40.620
this whole thing is a lot bigger
than drugs. I'm telling you.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.420
So what now?

23:42.460 --> 23:45.460
Now? I have to fulfill a promise
I made to Callum.

23:46.750 --> 23:46.960
[Elaine]
Yeah?

23:48.170 --> 23:50.130
Are you gonna get me outta
here, or what?

23:50.170 --> 23:52.970
No. I can't fly commercial
with the powder.

23:53.010 --> 23:54.640
Not to mention the
cops are all over me.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.430
Well, that's what
I pay you for.

23:58.470 --> 23:59.810
Figure it out.

24:00.850 --> 24:02.190
Call me on
my cell.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.610
Hey. So what do you think?

24:10.650 --> 24:13.200
Now a good time for me to give
you that boot in the arse?

24:37.310 --> 24:38.890
[tires screech]

24:41.600 --> 24:43.690
Well, you're persistent,
I'll give you that.

24:43.730 --> 24:46.110
We're persistent? You're the one
who couldn't stay dead.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.900
We know you're listed
as deceased.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.360
Let me guess.
You were deceased,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.650
but now you're just--
you're feeling much better.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.530
- Still not talking.
- Okay, look, buddy.

24:53.570 --> 24:55.110
We know that you're
probably a soldier.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.780
And whatever you have
in that suitcase

24:56.820 --> 24:58.580
is likely
very, very valuable.

24:58.620 --> 24:59.080
[Mal]
Jake?

24:59.990 --> 25:01.540
You might want
to see this.

25:04.290 --> 25:06.290
First you got a bunch of
pictures of Leslie.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.670
And now you got a bunch
of pictures of me.

25:07.710 --> 25:09.670
You better be some kind
of paparazzi.

25:09.710 --> 25:11.260
Or this is just
kinda creepy.

25:14.720 --> 25:15.590
Hey.
Des, where you been?

25:15.640 --> 25:16.840
I was at the Delta.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.970
The woman who hired Martin,
Elaine Goodwin,

25:19.010 --> 25:19.970
she's staying there.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.770
Speaking of Martin,
where is he?

25:21.810 --> 25:23.020
Leslie still has him down
at the station.

25:23.060 --> 25:23.980
Did you find anything?

25:24.020 --> 25:25.230
Uh, yeah, yeah I did.

25:25.270 --> 25:25.730
Check this out.

25:26.770 --> 25:28.650
This briefcase.
But it was empty.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.980
It looks like she transferred
the contents to a suitcase.

25:31.020 --> 25:32.730
Well, that's smart. Everyone's
looking for the briefcase.

25:32.780 --> 25:35.240
Yeah, but now she's not letting
that suitcase out of her sight.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.660
You know there was
something strange

25:37.700 --> 25:38.950
about that briefcase too.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.950
It was made out
of heavy material.

25:40.990 --> 25:45.040
Like so heavy that if you
were to drop it on your toe,

25:45.080 --> 25:48.500
it would turn a weird
purplish greenish color.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.920
- And the nail's kinda hang---
- The case.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.090
Right, right, right.
Okay.

25:52.130 --> 25:54.760
So I tracked down
the model online.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.630
It's a lead lined briefcase

25:56.680 --> 25:59.510
used for transporting
volatile medical supplies.

25:59.550 --> 26:00.600
Medical supplies?

26:00.640 --> 26:01.890
Yeah, and when
I overheard Elaine

26:01.930 --> 26:02.970
talking about the contents,

26:03.020 --> 26:04.980
she referred to it as
"the powder."

26:06.350 --> 26:07.770
What kind of powder needs to be
transported

26:07.810 --> 26:08.900
in a lead lined case?

26:09.810 --> 26:11.150
So Callum's not selling drugs.

26:11.190 --> 26:11.820
He's selling
radioactive materials.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.610
Look, this has nothing to do
with you or Leslie, okay?

26:15.650 --> 26:17.450
Well, I was right. Obviously
he's a photographer.

26:17.490 --> 26:18.530
He's doing a spread for
the Newfoundland Herald.

26:18.570 --> 26:19.740
You don't understand.

26:19.780 --> 26:20.660
Make us understand.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.370
[tires squeal]

26:25.580 --> 26:26.540
Jake.

26:26.580 --> 26:27.580
Mal. Stay
where you are.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.090
Leslie. We got your guy. We
were just bringing him to you.

26:34.340 --> 26:36.840
Put 'em on.
Around the door handle.

26:36.880 --> 26:37.970
- Leslie!
- Mal. You too.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.140
What the hell are
you talking about?

26:40.180 --> 26:41.050
Do it!

26:43.510 --> 26:44.520
Alright, b'y.

26:53.230 --> 26:56.400
I'm sorry. But I warned
you to stay off this case.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.030
[banging]

26:58.780 --> 26:59.740
Come on.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.200
Leslie!

27:03.240 --> 27:04.740
You just shot my car!

27:11.830 --> 27:13.130
I can't believe this.

27:13.170 --> 27:15.000
You've been working
special ops for eight years?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.460
You were supposed to be dead!

27:16.510 --> 27:19.430
Everyone needed to think I was.
It was part of my cover.

27:19.880 --> 27:20.260
Callum!

27:21.590 --> 27:23.680
I don't know what to say.
How could you do this?

27:23.720 --> 27:26.390
Leslie. I promise. I will
explain all this to you.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.020
But right now, many lives
are at stake.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.730
And we are running
out of time.

27:30.770 --> 27:33.110
Over this?
I take it?

27:35.150 --> 27:36.190
Where'd you get this?

27:36.230 --> 27:37.690
I pulled it off a perp.

27:37.730 --> 27:40.530
What are you doing running
around with nuclear materials?

27:40.570 --> 27:42.370
Leslie, please. I need to find
Elaine Goodwin right now.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.580
I have two uniforms on her
as we speak.

27:47.830 --> 27:48.960
Yellow cake?

27:49.910 --> 27:50.250
That's what's in the briefcase?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.670
Now, I know what you're both
thinking. Yellow cake.

27:53.710 --> 27:55.040
That sounds delicious.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.760
But it's actually a precursor
to enriched uranium

27:57.800 --> 27:59.090
used to make
nuclear weapons.

27:59.130 --> 28:00.670
Or even dirty bombs.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.390
Leslie has no idea that she's
riding next to an arms dealer.

28:03.430 --> 28:04.890
We gotta help her.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.770
Jake. Are you sure she
wants you to find her?

28:07.350 --> 28:08.890
[phone rings]

28:08.930 --> 28:10.980
Rose. We gotta go.
We'll check in later.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.060
- Sloan? Are you okay?
- [Sloan] Jake?

28:14.110 --> 28:14.940
I got a tip for you.

28:15.730 --> 28:17.020
So you're not in trouble.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.530
Come on now. It's a good one.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.660
Now, how much is it worth
to you? Twenty? Forty?

28:24.320 --> 28:27.450
Look, I don't really have any
money right now. You know what?

28:27.490 --> 28:29.370
You put that in the trunk.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.500
I'm gonna have to
give you an I.O.U.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.330
I know where you live.
Remember that.

28:33.370 --> 28:34.670
Sloan,
what's the tip?

28:34.710 --> 28:36.380
Remember that buddy I put
the tracker on earlier?

28:36.420 --> 28:37.840
Vinnie?

28:37.880 --> 28:40.340
Yeah, well, the woman he was
with, the one in the suit?

28:40.380 --> 28:42.720
She just walked into the hotel
about two minutes ago.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.220
What are you still doing at
the hotel? We talked about this.

28:45.260 --> 28:46.720
Relax, b'y. I'm
headed home now.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.560
Okay. Just stay away from
Vinnie and Elaine, okay?

28:52.520 --> 28:53.230
What about your girlfriend?

28:54.230 --> 28:56.310
My what?
What do you mean?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.860
She's here too.
With some handsome fella.

29:02.190 --> 29:03.110
I'm on my way.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.820
Leslie's at the Delta
with Callum.

29:05.860 --> 29:07.740
Rose was at the station
with Martin.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.410
We must be doing
something wrong.

29:09.450 --> 29:10.910
You know what?
You'd think we'd be able to

29:10.950 --> 29:11.910
change a tire in less
than ten minutes.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.420
Would've been five if
I'd done it alone.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.170
It's like I told
Malachy and Rose.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.550
I had no intention of
killing anybody.

29:22.590 --> 29:23.470
I just wanted what
was in the case.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.550
Look buddy, you can plead your
case all you want.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.680
But I have no control over
who stays or goes.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.600
[Martin]
Oh!

29:30.640 --> 29:34.310
Rosie, my angel. My savoir.
We used to be married.

29:34.350 --> 29:36.230
Why don't you say it
again louder.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.060
Because I don't think the
rookies in the back heard you.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.820
Oh, yeah. She doesn't like
it when I say that.

29:39.860 --> 29:42.070
I knew you'd come back
and bail me out.

29:42.110 --> 29:43.570
I knew you'd show up.
Thank you.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.240
No one said anything
about bail.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.780
Come on. Rosie,

29:46.820 --> 29:47.200
I've done my time.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.410
- Hiya Des.
- Hi.

29:49.450 --> 29:52.620
I answered every question that
Sergeant Bennett put to me.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.120
So I want you to
go up out there,

29:54.160 --> 29:55.460
pay that nice man,
and just--

29:55.500 --> 29:56.880
get me the hell
outta here.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.380
Please.

29:58.420 --> 30:00.000
Well, that depends,
Martin.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.460
On what?

30:01.500 --> 30:04.340
Because Des says that you
withdrew ten thousand dollars

30:04.380 --> 30:05.800
from your bank account
yesterday.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.970
Leaving the balance
at zero.

30:08.010 --> 30:10.430
Are you going to be able
to pay me back?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.430
Not really.
Not exactly.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.680
Okay. Well then you have to tell
me what is going on.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.190
It's like I told you.
I'm in debt.

30:17.230 --> 30:20.730
Now I owe big money to
some serious people.

30:20.770 --> 30:23.110
That's why I had to take
the Callum job.

30:23.150 --> 30:26.530
And now I still gotta come up
with fifty large for these guys.

30:26.570 --> 30:27.410
Well what happens if you don't
pay them back?

30:28.490 --> 30:30.370
Well then, I get to
be the dead guy.

30:30.780 --> 30:31.580
Oh...

30:32.700 --> 30:34.120
Is this the case you're
working on?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.040
Hey!

30:36.540 --> 30:38.750
It's this business woman on
the American No-Fly list.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.250
We just finished up
surveillance on her.

30:40.290 --> 30:41.710
Oh, wait. Elaine Goodwin.
I know her.

30:42.750 --> 30:43.800
Well, I don't know her,
know her.

30:43.840 --> 30:44.630
I was in her hotel room earlier.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.090
What?

30:46.130 --> 30:47.760
I mean, well, we weren't
there together.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.550
I mean, there was a bed,
and she was there.

30:49.590 --> 30:50.930
You know, it's not
what it sounds like.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.470
I was actually there looking
into some yellow cake.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.060
Yellow cake?

30:55.060 --> 30:55.930
Des.

30:57.430 --> 30:59.690
You survived a run-in
with a possible terrorist.

30:59.730 --> 31:00.150
Not bad.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.690
It is? Yeah, it is,

31:02.730 --> 31:02.900
isn't it?
It's not bad.

31:04.150 --> 31:06.030
What are you two girlfriends
gabbing about?

31:06.070 --> 31:08.030
Nuclear materials.
This is big.

31:08.070 --> 31:09.320
Actually, when I was in her
hotel room,

31:09.360 --> 31:10.490
she was on the phone.

31:10.530 --> 31:11.620
She was trying to find
a way out of town.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.030
We have to pull
her hotel phone records.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.410
See if we can figure out where
Elaine Goodwin's headed.

31:15.450 --> 31:18.500
Well, I'm not gonna follow up
on a tip from some idiot, but--

31:18.540 --> 31:20.290
Fine. Des, I'm gonna need
your help.

31:20.330 --> 31:20.370
Definitely.

31:21.790 --> 31:24.590
Looks like this idiot's got your
girlfriend's back.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.720
[Mal] [on phone] Did you get
Martin from the station?

31:29.760 --> 31:31.840
Yeah. I bailed him out about
fifteen minutes ago.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.350
We're headed home.
What's up?

31:33.390 --> 31:36.680
Just keep an eye on him. We're
heading over to the Delta.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.770
Leslie's there
with Callum.

31:38.350 --> 31:39.980
Mal? Be careful.

31:40.020 --> 31:40.940
I will.

31:41.850 --> 31:42.770
Thank you.

31:43.770 --> 31:45.150
I mean thank you
for everything.

31:45.190 --> 31:48.070
I really appreciate you
helping me out with this.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.740
I really do.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.820
No, no. Don't
you dare!

31:51.860 --> 31:53.950
Martin! No!

31:57.620 --> 31:59.960
Martin!
I am gonna kill you!

32:03.460 --> 32:04.880
She's in room 1101.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.130
Leslie, your arm.

32:06.170 --> 32:07.510
I'm not sitting
this one out.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.470
Hand over the
suitcase, now.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.380
[Leslie]
Do what he says.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.390
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- Why is that?

32:13.430 --> 32:14.970
Because I've rigged
this suitcase to blow.

32:15.550 --> 32:16.310
You're bluffing.

32:17.140 --> 32:17.810
You really wanna find out?

32:18.520 --> 32:19.730
Trigger's on the bottom.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.140
I put this down and we're all
in trouble. You.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.940
Lower the gun.
Put it on the bed.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.400
Now.

32:33.070 --> 32:34.200
Turn around.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.000
[door slams]

32:47.250 --> 32:48.630
What is it with this town?

32:51.220 --> 32:52.920
Come here. Get up.
Get up.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.050
Dad, she dropped the case.
It's here. It's one of these!

32:56.180 --> 32:57.720
Put your hands where
I can see them.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.970
Funny. That's what
I was gonna say.

33:05.310 --> 33:06.400
Found it.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.320
[bang]

33:10.360 --> 33:11.240
Oh...

33:12.990 --> 33:14.780
Sorry.
It's not personal.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.530
Ah. Martin.

33:19.370 --> 33:19.910
I don't think so.

33:20.830 --> 33:23.040
Look guys.
It's real easy.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.460
Just bring me
the yellow cake.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.960
And you get your
pretty cop back.

33:27.290 --> 33:28.420
Look,
I know you're military.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.000
What the hell do you have
us tangled up in?

33:30.050 --> 33:30.800
I'm Special Ops

33:30.840 --> 33:32.300
working
a mission.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.340
Either we give that woman the
ability to level a city...

33:35.050 --> 33:36.390
Or she kills Leslie.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.310
[Callum] I intercepted
Elaine's initial deal

33:42.350 --> 33:43.890
with her seller
over in Istanbul.

33:43.930 --> 33:45.390
And recovered
the yellow cake from him.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.690
Now the plan was,

33:46.730 --> 33:47.940
I would pose as the seller
and draw Elaine out.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.320
Yeah, but she
was on to you.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.610
That's why she hired Martin
and Vinnie to take you out.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.490
She never intended
on paying me.

33:54.530 --> 33:56.150
What does this all have to do
with Leslie Bennett?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.080
Nothing. This is all my fault.
She was just trying to help.

33:59.990 --> 34:00.120
Any sign of Martin?

34:01.290 --> 34:02.750
Well, yeah. I got a sign
of him all right.

34:03.370 --> 34:04.410
But I lost him.

34:04.450 --> 34:05.620
I'm gonna head over
to the office.

34:05.660 --> 34:06.870
Rose is checking the house.
[phone rings]

34:07.460 --> 34:08.460
Is that them?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.340
Leslie.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.170
You got one hour to get me my
yellow cake, or she dies.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.420
Where do you wanna meet?

34:15.470 --> 34:16.340
Not so fast.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.140
Get the suitcase.
Then call me.

34:19.220 --> 34:20.640
When I'm sure you got
the product,

34:20.680 --> 34:21.970
I'll give you a location.

34:24.850 --> 34:26.690
This isn't gonna work out
the way you want it to.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.940
Oh, you better
hope it does.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.230
She wants to do an exchange.
Leslie for the yellow cake.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.900
Jake. This is
nuclear material.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.280
There's only
so long I can hold off

34:37.320 --> 34:39.240
before telling my superiors
this stuff is out there.

34:40.030 --> 34:40.200
How long?

34:41.530 --> 34:43.700
An hour. Maybe two.
But once they're involved,

34:43.740 --> 34:45.370
they'll shut this
entire city down.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.960
Something tells me Leslie's not
gonna be their priority one.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.870
- Exactly.
- Do you got any idea

34:49.920 --> 34:51.330
where we can get our hands on
more of this stuff?

34:51.380 --> 34:53.130
No. It's not possible.
It's a rare commodity.

34:53.170 --> 34:54.460
That's what makes it
so valuable.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.840
So you got nothing
I can work with.

34:59.550 --> 35:00.470
Just this.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.720
That's a start.

35:13.650 --> 35:14.570
We actually keep our money

35:14.610 --> 35:15.780
in the bank now.
It's much safer.

35:17.030 --> 35:19.320
Sorry Rose.
Don't be angry with me, okay?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.990
Martin. You need to return
that suitcase.

35:22.030 --> 35:23.330
You have no idea what
you're into.

35:23.370 --> 35:24.540
Or what's at stake.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.500
Oh. Rose. I gotta go.

35:26.540 --> 35:26.870
I need this case.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.960
Alright. Now I'm broke.
And I'm not ready to die.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.250
At least not in the way
they're proposing right now.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.420
Martin, please.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.170
Okay? Leslie's life
is in danger.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.590
Do the right thing for once

35:38.630 --> 35:41.300
in your God forsaken life
and return that suitcase.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.260
Sorry Rose.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.020
I think this is where
we say goodbye.

35:48.100 --> 35:49.060
So just...

35:53.690 --> 35:55.270
[Tinny] So Elaine made five
calls to this warehouse.

35:56.230 --> 35:57.190
I think it's her
way out of town.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.900
Any idea what it is?

35:58.940 --> 36:00.610
It says here it's a marine
repair company.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.320
Marine? That's odd.

36:03.990 --> 36:07.330
Maybe she's planning on getting
off the island in a submarine.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.200
No Des.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.000
They export tons of engines
and equipment.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.960
I guess she's paying them for
a way out of the city.

36:24.220 --> 36:25.350
There she is.

36:32.310 --> 36:32.900
Oh my God.
She has Leslie.

36:33.850 --> 36:34.770
[Tinny] I have to call this in.

36:34.810 --> 36:35.940
Okay, I'll call Jake.

36:39.820 --> 36:40.530
Why don't you let me go?

36:41.360 --> 36:41.820
We can work something out?

36:42.570 --> 36:43.490
I like my plan better.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.320
[Jake]
I don't know.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.910
Leslie's plan has
a lot going for it.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.200
How did you find me?

36:49.240 --> 36:50.830
You want the yellow cake.
We got it.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.000
We want Leslie.
You have her.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.620
Let's just make
a simple exchange.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.040
I don't like surprises.

36:58.300 --> 36:58.960
You okay?

36:59.710 --> 37:01.130
Don't worry I'm fine.

37:01.170 --> 37:02.220
You finished?

37:03.590 --> 37:04.680
Show me the yellow cake.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.680
It's all there.

37:06.470 --> 37:08.720
Stand back.
Move.

37:11.980 --> 37:12.850
You.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.150
Check it out.

37:18.190 --> 37:19.360
[Jake]
Can I help her?

37:23.780 --> 37:26.370
[crackling sound]

37:27.910 --> 37:29.280
It passes.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.160
Well, I guess you'll be
wanted your girlfriend back.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.660
[Martin]
Good news.

37:32.700 --> 37:33.750
Okay. I'm back.

37:33.790 --> 37:35.080
I got the real

37:35.500 --> 37:36.460
yellow --

37:36.500 --> 37:37.670
If he's got it.
What's in here?

37:39.550 --> 37:40.590
Open it.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.390
Sand.

37:51.850 --> 37:52.640
I don't like being messed with.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.480
Okay. I think I've done
my part here.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.520
I'll just leave this
and I'll just move on.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.190
Don't move!

37:59.770 --> 38:00.770
I'm sorry, okay.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.320
We had no other choice.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.150
Why don't you just take the real
yellow cake, give us Leslie.

38:05.190 --> 38:07.530
Put down the gun, take it, and
we can all get out of here.

38:07.570 --> 38:08.530
Not yet.

38:09.450 --> 38:10.370
You open it.

38:14.370 --> 38:15.870
[zipping sound]

38:18.170 --> 38:20.250
[crackling sound]

38:20.290 --> 38:20.840
It's the real thing.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.510
Pack it up. We're
taking it with us.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.090
- That's not the deal.
- You changed the deal.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.050
[bang]

38:26.090 --> 38:27.260
[Martin]
Hey! Whoa!

38:30.140 --> 38:31.430
This is all your fault,
Martin.

38:31.470 --> 38:32.100
How is it my fault?

38:32.140 --> 38:33.390
This is the idiot

38:33.430 --> 38:34.850
who brought the
stuff out here to begin with.

38:34.890 --> 38:36.230
Would you shut up!
Both of you.

38:37.730 --> 38:39.560
Come on. Hurry up.

38:42.770 --> 38:44.610
We need to figure out a way
to get rid of this crazy lady

38:44.650 --> 38:46.030
without using a gun.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.780
I got a gun.

38:49.870 --> 38:51.160
You have a gun?

38:52.240 --> 38:53.740
Give it to me.
Please.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.000
Glad you said please.

38:56.580 --> 38:57.670
Let's go.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.630
I got an idea.

39:01.750 --> 39:03.300
Leslie!
[banging]

39:06.300 --> 39:07.050
[banging]

39:07.510 --> 39:08.380
[crash]

39:09.090 --> 39:09.970
[whack]

39:12.550 --> 39:13.850
Cover me.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.100
Are you okay?

39:19.440 --> 39:22.020
I'm alive. It must
be my lucky day.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.690
Come here.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.200
We should probably have
a little chat.

39:37.660 --> 39:42.630
Yeah. We will. I've just gotta
talk to the brass first.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.130
You look pretty morose

39:51.180 --> 39:52.890
for a man who just saved
the woman he loves.

39:52.930 --> 39:54.430
I'm best kind.

39:54.470 --> 39:56.930
I'll be even better
once I get Callum out of town.

39:57.470 --> 39:58.480
I like him.

40:05.110 --> 40:07.360
Listen, I think I should
apologize. Okay.

40:09.070 --> 40:11.660
Well, not I guess.
I wanna apologize

40:11.700 --> 40:13.370
for dragging you
into this mess.

40:13.410 --> 40:14.160
I'm really sorry.

40:14.660 --> 40:15.490
Apologize?

40:15.910 --> 40:16.120
Yeah.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.750
You almost
got Leslie killed.

40:18.790 --> 40:20.210
Not to mention
having a hand in almost

40:20.250 --> 40:21.620
blowing up the city.

40:21.660 --> 40:23.130
I told you he'd do it
someday, Rose.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.210
Okay. But I came back.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.290
Don't I get bonus points
for coming back?

40:26.340 --> 40:27.500
- I came back.
- What the hell were you

40:27.550 --> 40:28.510
gonna do with all of
that yellow cake anyway?

40:28.550 --> 40:29.920
I don't know.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.630
I was gonna sell it back
to the government, I thought.

40:31.670 --> 40:34.430
I can't imagine what
charges you're facing.

40:35.010 --> 40:36.470
Quite the gamut.

40:36.510 --> 40:37.890
You're looking at everything
from conspiracy to

40:37.930 --> 40:39.980
commit murder to
outright treason.

40:40.020 --> 40:40.940
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.230
Let's go. The military want
a word with you.

40:44.270 --> 40:46.940
Oh, that's not good.
That's never good.

40:46.980 --> 40:48.610
Listen, I swear to God,
when I get out of here,

40:48.650 --> 40:50.150
I'll make this up to you.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.070
I promise, Rose.

40:51.820 --> 40:53.360
I'll put things right.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.700
You two make yourselves
comfortable.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.620
The military have some
questions for you as well.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.660
Oh no.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.740
Oh yeah.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.880
So. This is where you
ran off to.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.630
Um. Do you want to head
to the Duke?

41:12.670 --> 41:15.090
Maybe I'll buy you a little
something to celebrate.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.090
What are we celebrating?

41:17.140 --> 41:19.850
Well, you followed your
instincts. You nabbed a crook.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.430
I think that's pretty good
for a day's work.

41:21.470 --> 41:23.190
And I broke up with Grayson.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.730
Is that something
to celebrate?

41:28.650 --> 41:28.690
Yeah.

41:30.190 --> 41:32.110
I mean, he was kind of a tool.
And I deserve better.

41:33.450 --> 41:36.570
Well, like I said, you
followed your instinct.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.740
So, let's celebrate.

41:40.740 --> 41:41.790
Okay Des.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.460
Jake.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.260
Listen. I was thinking we could

41:53.300 --> 41:54.670
pick up where
we left off this morning,

41:54.720 --> 41:56.180
just you, me and--

41:59.180 --> 42:00.180
Callum,

42:00.220 --> 42:01.220
apparently.

42:05.890 --> 42:06.850
Am I interrupting
something?

42:07.690 --> 42:09.400
No, no.
Of course not.

42:10.070 --> 42:11.280
Were those for me?

42:12.190 --> 42:13.900
No, b'y,
they're for him.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.530
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

42:20.370 --> 42:24.330
Um. Do you feel like you need to
explain anything? Or--

42:25.750 --> 42:29.290
Jake. I was gonna tell ya,
when the time is right.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.670
Tell me that he's your
ex-boyfriend. And he's not dead.

42:37.010 --> 42:38.590
He's not my ex-boyfriend.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.220
Jake.
He's my husband.
