DADDY, PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.335
IS THIS WHAT
YOU WANT?

10:30.421 --> 10:35.461
YOUR FATHER TO BREAK US
UP AT THE POINT OF A GUN?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.293
(Mitchell)

10:48.982 --> 10:51.314

10:55.572 --> 10:58.405
<i>NOW YOU'LL HAVE THE
COMMON COURTESY AND SENSE</i>

10:58.491 --> 10:59.606
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.334
[sighs]

11:14.424 --> 11:16.756
YOU KNOW, I ALMOST
FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.880
BUT NOT QUITE, HMM?

11:18.970 --> 11:20.756
NOT QUITE.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.555
A GOOD STIFF DRINK
IS IN ORDER.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.847
AMEN.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.977
ANNE?

13:01.823 --> 13:02.938
ANNE?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.285
WHAT?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.864
THAT LAWYER
PHONED AGAIN.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.366
DID YOU HEAR ME?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.038
I SAID THAT LAWYER
PHONED AGAIN.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.038
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.289
WILL THAT HELP?

13:16.379 --> 13:18.120
YES, IT'LL HELP

13:18.172 --> 13:20.129
IF I DRINK
ENOUGH OF IT.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.006
IT'S AMBROSIA.

13:22.093 --> 13:25.211
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THE
HOUSE AVVAY FROM US, ANNE.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.466
<i>ARE THEY REALLY'?</i>

13:26.556 --> 13:27.762
YES.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.635
WELL, THEY CAN HAVE IT.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.345
THAT'S ALL IT MEANS
TO YOU?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.847
THAT'S ALL.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.519
THE HOME YOU
WERE RAISED IN.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.222
RAISED? YOU
MEAN LOWERED.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.231
SPOILED, SQUEEZED TO DEATH
VVITH A VELVET GLOVE.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.811
ARE WE STARTING
THAT AGAIN?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.862
WE STARTED IT
THE DAY I WAS BORN.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.067
YOU, ME,
AND DADDY, DEAR DADDY.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.823
I WON'T HEAR YOU
DEBASE HIS MEMORY.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.708
[gasps]

13:56.794 --> 13:58.250
DEBASE HIS MEMORY--

13:58.338 --> 14:01.706
HOW CORN BALL
CAN YOU GET?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.666
HOW DARE YOU...

14:04.761 --> 14:08.345
HOW DARE YOU!

14:08.389 --> 14:12.007
HOVV DARE YOU TALK LIKE
THAT ABOUT YOUR OVVN FATHER

14:12.101 --> 14:13.933
WHO GAVE YOU
EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING!

14:14.020 --> 14:16.352
THAT'S RIGHT,
<i>GAVE</i> ME EVERYTHING.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.271
I NEVER HAD TO EARN
A BIT OF IT.

14:18.358 --> 14:23.023
I DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORK FOR ANYTHING.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.280
NEVER HAD TO BOTHER ACQUIRING
SUCH USELESS TRAITS

14:26.366 --> 14:28.232
AS JUDGEMENT,
DISCRIMINATION.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.533
[witch-like speech]
NO, WHO NEEDS THEM?

14:30.578 --> 14:31.864
CHEERS.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.197
YOU BLAME
YOUR FATHER FOR...

14:35.249 --> 14:38.287
YES, I BLAME MY FATHER.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.210
OH, HE WAS STRONG,
WASN'T HE?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.962
STRONG, SO EFFICIENT,
SO METICULOUS

14:43.049 --> 14:44.631
AND I WAS HIS BABY.

14:44.717 --> 14:49.302
16,17,18 YEARS OF AGE
AND I WAS HIS BABY

14:49.389 --> 14:52.302
VVITH ALL THE KEEN
INSIGHTS OF A BABY.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.431
ALL THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND,
THE ABILITY TO JUDGE.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.762
SO I MADE A MISTAKE...

14:58.856 --> 15:02.065
A LITTLE MISTAKE JUST
ENOUGH TO RUIN MY LIFE.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.563
ANNE, DON'T.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.400
AH, HOW WONDERFUL.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.826
IAM FINALLY
BEING DISCIPLINED

15:09.909 --> 15:11.650
AT THE AGE OF 43.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.496
WHAT ABOUT
THE HOUSE, ANNE?

15:16.582 --> 15:19.745
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE HOUSE.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.455
I CARE.

15:21.546 --> 15:26.086
THAT'S YOUR MISFORTUNE
AND NONE OF MY OWN.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.088
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I SAW TODAY?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.680
DO YOU?

15:30.763 --> 15:31.924
I DON'T KNOW.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.348
I SAW A GHOST, MOTHER...

15:35.435 --> 15:39.474
MY OWN.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.645
WHAT?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.597
INTRIGUING, ISN'T IT?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.812
TO BE HAUNTED
BY ONE'S OWN SELF.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.018
POSITIVELY INTRIGUING.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.150
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.607
I'M TALKING ABOUT
GHOSTS, MOTHER.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.196
<i>PHANTOMS,
VISITATIONS.</i>

15:54.287 --> 15:56.449
REMINDERS...

15:56.539 --> 16:00.783
FROM THE PAST
AND THE FUTURE.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.543
I WENT OUT RIDING TODAY.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.212
OUT WHERE I USUALLY GO,
BEYOND THE MEADOW.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.835
I WAS ON A RIDGE
AND I SAW

16:07.925 --> 16:12.635
THIS YOUNG GIRL
RIDE TOWARD ME.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.717
ME.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.299
ME, MOTHER...

16:17.393 --> 16:20.886
AS I LOOKED AT 18.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.971
DO YOU REMEMBER?

16:23.024 --> 16:26.813
THE DAY OF MY ENGAGEMENT PARTY?
DO YOU?

16:26.861 --> 16:31.480
JUNE 13, 1939.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.364
I EVEN
REMEMBER THE DATE.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.158
REMEMBER HOW
I CAME IN TERRIFIED

16:35.244 --> 16:38.407
BECAUSE SOME WOMAN
HAD ATTACKED ME?

16:38.498 --> 16:42.583
AND DADDY, DEAR DADDY HAD
THEM SEARCH FOR HER IN VAIN.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.501
WELL, I WAS
THAT WOMAN, MOTHER.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.126
Haughs]
I AM THAT WOMAN.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.582
WANNA KNOW
SOMETHING FUNNY,

16:50.676 --> 16:52.667
SOMETHING MARVELOUSLY FUNNY?

16:52.762 --> 16:55.754
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME
I'VE SEEN HER.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.759
BIZARRE, ISN'T IT?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.182
I KEEP SEEING HER
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.601
KEEP SEEING MYSELF
AGAIN AND AGAIN

17:02.688 --> 17:05.771
ON THAT DAY, THAT
ONE PARTICULAR DAY.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.601
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION
"GO CHASE YOURSELF"?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.196
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING--

17:11.239 --> 17:13.901
CHASING MYSELF.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.029
DO YOU REMEMBER VVHAT
ROBERT SAID TO ME THAT DAY?

17:17.118 --> 17:20.031
"MAYBE IT'S A WARNING,"
HE SAID.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.499
<i>HE THOUGHT
HE WAS JOKING.</i>

17:21.582 --> 17:23.367
<i>WELL, IT WAS
A WARNING.</i>

17:23.459 --> 17:26.372
I VVAS WARNING MYSELF NOT
TO MARRY THE VVRONG MAN.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.080
BUT I MARRIED HIM
ANYWAY, DIDN'T I?

17:28.172 --> 17:31.255
<i>AND NOW I HAVE
PAID THE PRICE.</i>

17:31.342 --> 17:34.710
I HAVE BECOME THAT
GROTESQUE PHANTOM

17:34.762 --> 17:37.470
THAT FRIGHTENED
THAT POOR CHILDLIKE GIRL

17:37.557 --> 17:40.390
HALF TO DEATH
25 YEARS AGO.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.392
A STERILE,
ALCOHOLIC PHANTOM

17:43.437 --> 17:48.056
MARRIED TO A MAN WHO'S RUN
THIS ESTATE INTO RUIN.

17:48.150 --> 17:53.145
IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN
I WAS BEING WARNED.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.606
WARNED ABOUT WHAT?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.657
HUH?

17:57.743 --> 18:02.078
NO ANSWER FOR
YOUR LOVING HUSBAND?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.659
HUH?

18:03.749 --> 18:08.494
OH, SHE... SHE'S TURNED
HER BACK ON ME.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.250
I WONDER WHAT
THIS SIGNIFIES.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.331
LACK OF RESPECT?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.133
YOU MIGHT HAVE
THE COURTESY

18:15.219 --> 18:17.927
JUST ONCE...

18:17.972 --> 18:19.178
WOULD YOU...

18:19.265 --> 18:21.848
WOULD YOU GET OUT?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.174
DO I HAVE TO DRAW
YOU A MAP?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.101
GET OUT OF HERE,
GET OUT!

18:34.322 --> 18:38.486
TWO MINDS BUT
WITH A SINGLE THOUGHT:

18:38.576 --> 18:41.443
ALCOHOLIC DISSOLUTION.

18:41.495 --> 18:45.784
YOU'VE NOT FAR
TO GO.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.701
IT'S DISRESPECT?

18:49.795 --> 18:52.878
IT'S DISRESPECT,
MY GIRL.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.707
CAN'T HAVE THAT,
YOU KNOW.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.213
NOW THAT...

18:58.304 --> 19:01.171
YOUR OLD DADDY'S
GONE AND BURIED

19:01.265 --> 19:04.508
I'M THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE NOW.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.218
<i>MAN'? MAN?</i>

19:06.312 --> 19:08.144

19:08.189 --> 19:10.556

MY DARLING.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.484
<i>SWEET HEART , LOVELY .</i>

19:14.528 --> 19:19.398
MAN, AND YOU MUST LOOK
UP TO ME VVITH RESPECT.

19:19.492 --> 19:24.362
YOU CAN GO
TO THE DEVIL.

19:24.455 --> 19:28.574
NOW, WE MUST
HAVE RESPECT.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.205
WE MUST HAVE
A LITTLE RESPECT.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.206
AFTER ALL,

19:52.483 --> 19:54.190
MM-HMM.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.771
I SAW YOU GO OUT
AND I THOUGHT

19:55.861 --> 19:57.272
MAYBE YOU
DIDN'T FEEL WELL.

19:57.363 --> 20:01.527
OH, I'M FINE.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.609
LOVELY NIGHT.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.411

20:06.497 --> 20:08.204
ARE YOU WARM ENOUGH?

20:08.249 --> 20:09.239
MM-HMM.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.791
YOUR FATHER
THROWS QUITE A PARTY.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.921
YES, HE DOES.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.298
HE'S REALLY
IN A MARVELOUS MOOD.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.925
DADDY'S ALWAYS
IN A GOOD MOOD

20:25.015 --> 20:26.597
WHEN HE GETS HIS WAY.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.551
WHAT?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.261
NOTHING.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.096
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I AM A BIT CHILLY.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.101
DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU
COULD GET SOMETHING

20:35.192 --> 20:36.978
