Why does he want to beat you?

this thousand-pound note.

weighs a thousand pounds?

17:13.734 --> 17:15.533
No, it's British money.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.000
A pound is like a dollar.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.367
Why am I even bothering
to explain this?

17:21.667 --> 17:22.867
As I was saying,

17:23.500 --> 17:26.834
this thousand-pound note was loot
from the Great Train Robbery,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.166
and only one person could have had it.

17:31.066 --> 17:32.967
But what if Gordo's
not being immature?

17:33.300 --> 17:36.233
What if Kate's right, and he really
does want to win to impress me?

17:36.433 --> 17:38.233

17:38.367 --> 17:40.533
but I cannot get it around that idea.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.500
And, um...

17:43.967 --> 17:47.133
If I name the wrong suspect,
I could let Gordo win.

17:47.934 --> 17:51.333
That one person,
our mystery culprit is...

17:52.133 --> 17:54.934
But if I do that,
does that mean I like Gordo?

17:56.133 --> 17:57.467
It's Guy Gaviota.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.300
Well, I guess we're gonna find out.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.667
He did not do it.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.700
Guy Gaviota did not do it.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.633
The thousand-pound note
was the last piece of the puzzle.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.700
Now, Lord McGuffin was an avid golfer,

18:09.834 --> 18:11.967
and he always liked
to wager on a game.

18:12.266 --> 18:16.467
So he won that thousand pounds
from none other than the maid.
