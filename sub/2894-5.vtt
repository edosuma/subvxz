00:26.092 --> 00:28.761
This new wing will increase
my velocity by 30%?

00:28.763 --> 00:31.063
Of course it will,
I invented it.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.071
(growls)

00:39.205 --> 00:40.506
What is it?

00:41.074 --> 00:44.043
Some dead man took
all the peanut butter!

00:44.045 --> 00:46.078
What care I for
the butter of peanuts?

00:46.279 --> 00:47.346
(sips)

00:47.348 --> 00:48.647
(roars)

00:48.782 --> 00:50.215
(grunts)

00:51.418 --> 00:53.218
Mmm. Peanut butter.

00:55.655 --> 00:56.722
(grunts)

00:59.093 --> 01:02.461
Little late for
the cleaning crew, ain't it?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.462
Cap, heads up!

01:15.475 --> 01:16.809
Missed.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.744
I never miss.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.813
(alarms wail)

01:20.815 --> 01:22.081
(ground rumbles)

01:22.083 --> 01:23.148
(grunts)

01:25.852 --> 01:27.553
You rang?

01:28.822 --> 01:32.124
You know, hulk,
when I built this place,
I designed it with doors.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.494
You're right,
doors are so overrated.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.631
Falcon: They don't
have any heat signatures.
And, no pulses.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.601
It can't be.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.204
(growls)
(grunts)

01:45.772 --> 01:47.473
They ain't puny humans.

01:49.309 --> 01:52.644
Iron man, the tower
has uv light frequencies
built in, right?

01:52.812 --> 01:55.247
Yeah, but...
Fire them up!

01:55.548 --> 01:57.783
Okay. Weird, but okay.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.887
(creatures hiss)

02:02.856 --> 02:04.189
(screams)

02:05.458 --> 02:07.826
What just happened?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.360
Vampires.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.397
Uh, you gotta
be kidding me.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.899
(pants)

02:15.135 --> 02:16.468
(gasps)

02:16.470 --> 02:18.237
Black widow?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.605
(strains)

02:19.607 --> 02:22.174
Man:  <i>Good evening,</i>
<i>captain america.</i>

02:22.176 --> 02:24.610
<i>It has been a long time.</i>

02:25.211 --> 02:28.347
<i>I send this female</i>
<i>with a message.</i>

02:28.349 --> 02:33.585
<i>I offer you her life</i>
<i>in exchange for yours.</i>

02:34.721 --> 02:35.888
(groans)

02:35.890 --> 02:39.791
Tell me widow has
a creepy voice power
I never knew about.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.362
That was dracula.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.413
Black widow
is a vampire?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.483
No, not yet.
She's still in
the early stages.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.351
Dracula's hold on her
isn't complete.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.620
She's going to get worse,
way worse, but...

03:09.455 --> 03:11.623
We still have a chance
to save her if we act quickly.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.760
Look, maybe I'll buy that
there are such things
as vampires.

03:14.762 --> 03:18.463
Big maybe. But count dracula?
Come on.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.433
We're talking the,
"I vant to drink
your blood," guy, right?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.268
Not count, just dracula.

03:23.270 --> 03:26.572
He finds count insulting,
since he's king
of the vampire nation.

03:26.574 --> 03:30.409
Well, great. Let me know
when frankenstein's monster
and the wolf man show.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.478
Don't mock. There's
often truth in myth.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.414
Wasn't I a myth
until you met me?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.349
But hawkeye's got a point.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.419
Thor, your powers seem like
magic to people on earth,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.421
But it's simply
asgardian science.

03:44.023 --> 03:47.926
There must be some kind
of scientific explanation for
these so-called vampires.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.662
(yells)

03:50.997 --> 03:52.497
(grunts)

03:58.371 --> 03:59.638
(cries out)

04:00.807 --> 04:02.341
Odin's beard!

04:02.343 --> 04:03.408
(yells)

04:04.544 --> 04:06.111
Mjolnir, to me!

04:09.349 --> 04:10.515
(grunts)

04:12.418 --> 04:15.287
She's fighting at
a whole new level.
It's like she's a...

04:19.826 --> 04:21.627
A vampire,
like I said.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.462
Why did she run
into a mirror?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.564
She couldn't
see her reflection.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.833
Falcon: Just like
in the movies.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.302
(scan whirs)

04:31.604 --> 04:34.539
Okay, I've used her biometrics
to get into her
personal shield file.

04:35.475 --> 04:39.444
Falcon:  <i>She was following</i>
<i>a lead on the red skull</i>
<i>in transylvania?</i>

04:40.813 --> 04:42.881
That's it. Now, if we
want to cure her,

04:42.883 --> 04:46.385
We need to find the vampire
who turned her into this
and force him to release her.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.387
Not so fast, cap.

04:48.389 --> 04:52.491
This is probably m.O.D.O.K.'s
brain-switching machine,

04:52.493 --> 04:54.426
Or a form of hypnotism.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.328
I just need...
Tony, we are wasting time!

04:56.330 --> 04:57.963
We need to get
to transylvania.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.898
A little faith, rogers.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.968
If there's a way to cure
widow, I can do it here.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.436
Jarvis:  <i>Error, sir.</i>

05:04.438 --> 05:05.804
(electricity sizzles)

05:06.773 --> 05:08.640
What's your tech
telling you now?

05:09.442 --> 05:11.343
That we should go
to transylvania?

05:18.918 --> 05:20.385
Falcon: What are you
loading up there?

05:21.387 --> 05:23.355
Silver-plated
strike discs.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.424
Tools to deal with
dracula's troops.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.992
Can't hulk
just smash them?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.428
He can knock them down,
but they won't stop.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.762
All right, van helsing,
you want to tell us

05:30.764 --> 05:33.065
Why you're such
an expert on vampires?

05:33.533 --> 05:37.569
During the war,
dracula and our country
were uneasy allies.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.505
<i>Hydra was trying</i>
<i>to invade transylvania.</i>

05:40.507 --> 05:42.741
<i>Dracula was protecting</i>
<i>his land.</i>

05:42.743 --> 05:44.710
<i>The enemy of my enemy</i>
<i>sort of thing.</i>

05:44.877 --> 05:46.645
Thor:  <i>But why is he</i>
<i>after you now?</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:50.015
Dracula is a king.
He takes what he wants.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.584
I must have
something he wants.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.686
And you don't
know what that is?

05:54.922 --> 05:58.690
No, but finding that
out is our only chance
to save widow.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.625
Relax, people.
You're all acting like

06:00.627 --> 06:02.461
You're in the middle
of a horror movie.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.795
We just need to
break into his castle

06:03.797 --> 06:06.498
And find out what
dracula is using on her.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.602
Nanotech, maybe?
I just can't see it, yet.

06:11.404 --> 06:14.506
Really?
Wooden stake arrows?
Why not?

06:14.508 --> 06:17.976
I am uneasy, captain.
This smells of a trap.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.113
Captain america:  <i>No kidding.</i>

06:26.786 --> 06:28.553
<i>What is the status?</i>

06:29.489 --> 06:32.391
The avengers approach
my kingdom.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.460
The soldier is with them.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.863
<i>Just as we predicted.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:42.000
<i>Follow the plan and</i>
<i>I promise you will get</i>

06:42.002 --> 06:45.504
<i>What has been denied to you</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:08.927
(thunder cracking)

07:13.166 --> 07:15.133
What, is it always
nighttime here?

07:15.135 --> 07:20.005
Dracula:  <i>Yes, bowman,</i>
<i>my kingdom lives</i>
<i>in eternal night.</i>

07:23.676 --> 07:25.210
Good evening, avengers.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.846
I see you received my

07:27.848 --> 07:29.214
Invitation.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.721
So, captain, my offer.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.224
Your life for the woman's.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.693
Are you willing to accept?

07:41.695 --> 07:44.496
Hmm...
Wow. You need new
head-shots, drac.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.064
You look nothing
like your pictures.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.933
Captain america: Don't!

07:48.167 --> 07:49.468
Hawkeye:
Well, that was easy.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.671
You have no idea
what you've started.
Or finished?

07:55.508 --> 07:56.608
(grunts)

07:58.945 --> 08:04.549
Because of our history,
captain, I was going to make
this as painless as possible.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.619
I see that my mercy
is not wanted.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.921
(thunder cracking)

08:10.189 --> 08:12.524
Destroy them all.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.966
I hate to think I was wasting
all that stake carving time!

08:25.137 --> 08:27.672
Jarvis, what am
I looking at here?

08:27.907 --> 08:31.910
Jarvis:  <i>It appears that</i>
<i>the vampire genetic structure</i>
<i>can reconstitute itself.</i>

08:31.912 --> 08:34.645
<i>They do not take on damage</i>
<i>the same way as you.</i>

08:34.648 --> 08:36.515
<i>After careful analysis, sir,</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:39.985
It is my conclusion that
you are down in trouble town.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.686
Thanks for the
color play, jarvis.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.223
All right, guys, let's
hit them with everything
we got and a little more.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.225
We'll figure out how to
make it permanent later.

08:47.727 --> 08:48.860
(vampires hiss)

08:51.030 --> 08:52.797
You over-think, stark.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.232
Just smash!

08:55.868 --> 08:57.135
(grunts)

09:02.074 --> 09:03.808
(all hiss)

09:08.915 --> 09:10.148
A whip?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.917
Gonna have to go
higher tech than that.

09:12.618 --> 09:13.852
(snarls)

09:14.687 --> 09:16.555
That's not normal.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.956
(strains)

09:21.627 --> 09:24.296
Get to the entrance!
Right behind you, cap.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.166
(vampires hiss)

09:28.935 --> 09:30.001
(grunts)

09:33.739 --> 09:35.273
Wooden stake arrows work.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.275
I like when iron man's wrong.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.877
(growls)

09:38.879 --> 09:39.945
(laughs)

09:43.082 --> 09:44.583
(roars)

09:45.918 --> 09:49.287
Come, demons.
I could do this all night!

09:54.060 --> 09:56.094
You may have to.
They just keep coming.

09:57.229 --> 10:00.165
This tech is amazing.
It's like it's alive.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.867
Alive? That's it!

10:03.235 --> 10:05.003
Non-genetic biodrivers.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.206
This isn't magic,
it's a form of biotech.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.641
There!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.210
They use blood
to transfer data.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.013
Piggy-backing program commands
through the white cells.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.182
I just have to hack
these sequence codes

10:17.184 --> 10:19.351
Before widow becomes
a full-fledged vampire.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.620
I already know how
to get widow back.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.822
Hulk, thor,
cover this entrance.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.323
Falcon, hawkeye,
around me.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.392
Hulk, make me a hole.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.130
Hulk: Hole!

10:36.202 --> 10:39.137
Dracula's chambers
are in the north tower.
How do you do that?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.772
Furthest from the sun.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.340
I was just about
to say that.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.679
Black widow:  <i>Falcon!</i>
<i>Falcon, help me please.</i>

10:47.681 --> 10:48.847
Guys?

10:49.715 --> 10:51.650
Black widow:  <i>Please, hurry.</i>

10:58.691 --> 11:00.392
(footsteps approach)

11:04.163 --> 11:06.698
Widow? You okay?

11:12.104 --> 11:13.304
(snarls)

11:13.306 --> 11:15.306
(bell rings)
(cries out)

11:15.709 --> 11:20.945
The sonic navigation units
that run your armor
make you vulnerable.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.213
(strains)

11:22.682 --> 11:24.983
Great job as
an avenger, wilson.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.384
Hawkeye: Back away,
natasha.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.453
He may be a noob,
but he's our noob.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.689
Clint?

11:30.691 --> 11:33.892
Help me.
Dracula's controlling me.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.226
I can't stop him.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.062
No, fight it.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.196
(grunts)

11:38.198 --> 11:43.101
The avenger's compassion
will always be their weakness.

11:45.137 --> 11:49.708
Will more innocents
suffer before you
give me what I want?

11:50.142 --> 11:52.043
What do you say,
my captain?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.313
Put them down.
I'll come with you.

11:56.082 --> 11:59.217
I knew you
wouldn't disappoint.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.053
(vampires hiss)

12:05.991 --> 12:07.292
(growls)

12:09.295 --> 12:10.995
Vampires are cowards.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.300
Indeed. Their strike and
retreat tactics lack honor.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.102
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.304
Probably not, blondie.
Just smash!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.005
(roars)

12:24.844 --> 12:26.044
(yells)

12:28.180 --> 12:29.948
(vampires hiss)

12:33.018 --> 12:35.386
Guess lighting works
as good as sunlight.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.256
Jarvis:  <i>Sir, the hack codes</i>
<i>for black widow's</i>
<i>blood are ready.</i>

12:38.258 --> 12:42.093
<i>I cross-referenced her blood</i>
<i>with the other avengers</i>

12:42.095 --> 12:44.028
<i>And something</i>
<i>alarming came up.</i>

12:44.997 --> 12:46.364
(shrieks)

12:46.366 --> 12:48.066
Define alarming.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.435
Ladies, please.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.907
Jarvis:  <i>It concerns</i>
<i>captain america.</i>

13:04.150 --> 13:06.785
Why are you doing this?
We were allies.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.154
I have a new enemy.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.523
Okay, we've had
common enemies before.

13:11.525 --> 13:12.824
The avengers can...

13:12.826 --> 13:15.226
My enemy is humanity!

13:15.795 --> 13:17.195
(both grunt)

13:18.330 --> 13:21.299
There are more of you
humans every century.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.434
My kingdom is threatened.

13:24.136 --> 13:28.206
I can no longer hide
in the shadows
of rumor and myth.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.208
I am at war!

13:30.342 --> 13:33.111
Release the widow,
then we can talk.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.146
(laughs)

13:35.148 --> 13:38.183
You are in no position
to make demands.

13:40.286 --> 13:45.456
I have recently learned
that the super soldier serum
coursing through your veins

13:45.458 --> 13:49.160
Can cure me of my
one and only weakness.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.929
Let me guess.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.330
Red skull?

13:53.399 --> 13:55.967
But you were at war
with him. How could you?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.870
These are strange
times, captain.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.573
(roars)

14:03.108 --> 14:04.275
(hisses)

14:04.476 --> 14:07.111
You know you can't
trust the skull.

14:07.113 --> 14:10.615
Of course I can't trust him,
that's why I'm using him.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.184
With your blood
in my veins,

14:13.186 --> 14:16.888
I will be able to destroy
hydra, the avengers,

14:16.890 --> 14:20.291
Anyone who dares
stand in my way.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.093
(grunts)

14:22.595 --> 14:23.962
(gasps)

14:28.400 --> 14:29.467
Huh?

14:33.138 --> 14:34.305
(grunts)

14:35.908 --> 14:40.245
With your blood, captain,
I will walk again
in the daylight.

14:43.315 --> 14:44.916
Finally.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.220
Hulk...
Like you need
to tell me!

14:51.257 --> 14:53.191
Iron man:
Not even dracula
can handle a hulk.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.425
Right?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.128
(dracula coughs)

15:01.200 --> 15:02.500
(grunts)

15:03.602 --> 15:05.270
(strains)

15:08.307 --> 15:09.941
(roars)

15:10.976 --> 15:12.610
That doesn't look good.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.479
(growls)

15:15.547 --> 15:17.315
That looks worse.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.951
(roars)

15:25.224 --> 15:27.091
(roars)

15:28.527 --> 15:32.230
Slave, finish the avengers.

15:32.965 --> 15:36.000
(stammering) yes, master.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.038
Hey I'll, I'll replace
the peanut butter.
(timidly laughs)

15:40.040 --> 15:41.372
That was you?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.473
(hulk roars)

15:52.485 --> 15:56.654
Incredible. He is even
stronger than before.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.493
(dracula laughs)

16:03.463 --> 16:09.400
Dracula: Black widow
is the least of your worries,
captain america.

16:11.603 --> 16:14.605
Now, that I have
the power of the hulk,

16:14.607 --> 16:18.543
There is nothing to stop me
from getting your blood.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.113
(laughs)

16:24.550 --> 16:25.616
(grunts)

16:26.518 --> 16:27.719
(strains)

16:31.423 --> 16:33.458
(dracula cries out)

16:37.229 --> 16:38.496
(strains)

16:38.498 --> 16:40.164
What's happening?

16:40.466 --> 16:41.499
(gags)

16:41.501 --> 16:45.069
Jarvis:  <i>Sir, hulk's blood is</i>
<i>attacking dracula's blood.</i>

16:45.571 --> 16:47.038
(computer whirs)

16:47.172 --> 16:49.173
That's it, the gamma rays.

16:51.611 --> 16:56.147
Has a similar
ionizing property
to solar radiation.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.215
English, please.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.450
Hulk's blood is
kind of like sunlight.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.552
Thank you.
Is there a plan
in there somewhere?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.755
Yeah, we make him madder.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.525
I am an expert at that.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.194
Strike and retreat.
Ha! He hates it.

17:14.567 --> 17:18.569
Cause I spend a lot
of time making sure
he doesn't get mad.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.540
They'll burn out
the dracu-cells. I think.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.809
Good. That's the idea.

17:25.310 --> 17:29.447
But it's not enough!
Come on, people!
We need him angrier!

17:29.449 --> 17:30.515
Angrier!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.384
(growls)

17:37.589 --> 17:38.589
This way, you oaf!

17:39.591 --> 17:41.526
(thunder crashes)

17:42.528 --> 17:43.728
(roars)

17:43.730 --> 17:45.129
Over here!

17:50.269 --> 17:51.669
Slave, no!

17:54.740 --> 17:56.274
(hisses)

17:59.078 --> 18:00.478
(growls)

18:00.480 --> 18:02.380
I hope that's angry enough.

18:02.548 --> 18:03.781
I hope it's not.

18:04.883 --> 18:08.686
Iron man: His blood cells are
like millions of tiny suns,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.655
Burning away
the vampire infection.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.657
(strains)

18:18.097 --> 18:19.597
Come on, big green.
You can do it.

18:19.731 --> 18:20.865
(groans)

18:22.501 --> 18:23.668
(groans)

18:29.341 --> 18:30.508
Is he dead?

18:30.642 --> 18:31.876
Wait for it.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.611
(snores)

18:36.448 --> 18:38.583
He purged himself?

18:38.585 --> 18:41.285
That's... That's impossible.

18:42.387 --> 18:43.654
(roars)

18:46.558 --> 18:47.658
No.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.694
That's the hulk.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.668
I was so close.
So close!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.637
Release the widow.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.305
Away from me!

19:01.307 --> 19:04.442
Let her go, or digesting
gamma radiation

19:04.444 --> 19:07.178
Will be the least painful
moment of your day.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.412
(ground rumbles)
huh?

19:13.418 --> 19:14.919
This is not over!

19:15.487 --> 19:17.788
You have won
nothing, avengers.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.624
The widow is mine.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.559
She will be mine forever!

19:26.865 --> 19:29.600
You're coming with us, nat,
we're going to save you.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.470
Falcon: Uh, who's going
to wake up the hulk?

19:33.539 --> 19:35.439
No time for questions.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.553
This is a synthesized
version of hulk's blood.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.889
It will burn out the
vampire virus and cure her.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.459
No chance she'll,
you know, turn green
or something?

19:55.627 --> 19:58.329
Of course not.
Right, tony?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.932
Right. I mean,
probably not, no.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.500
Hopefully not.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.901
I don't know.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.436
Let's find out.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.413
(vampires hiss)

20:23.222 --> 20:24.922
Dracula: Let him pass.

20:29.528 --> 20:31.362
Be honored.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.498
I show few my moments
of weakness.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.701
Your present state,
your highness,

20:36.703 --> 20:40.438
Is not your fault
but that of the avengers.

20:40.672 --> 20:45.443
You came to point
out my humiliation
to those mortals?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.511
Be careful, skull.

20:47.646 --> 20:52.550
No. I came to offer
you a seat on my cabal.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.854
A powerful consortium
devoted to the thing
you also seek.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.791
What, pray tell,
do you believe I seek?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.560
Revenge.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.264
I am listening.

21:10.535 --> 21:11.869
(moans)

21:11.871 --> 21:13.304
Where am I?

21:13.306 --> 21:14.572
It's kind of
a long story.

21:14.906 --> 21:18.676
I remember red skull
and dracula, he bit...

21:18.678 --> 21:20.745
(gasps) am I a vampire?

21:21.346 --> 21:22.747
You got better.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.315
(sniffs)

21:24.317 --> 21:25.916
What is that
awful smell?

21:26.485 --> 21:29.553
Just in case stark's tech
wasn't as good
as he thought it was.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.556
Do you have a wooden stake
ready too, just in case?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.458
(chuckles)

21:34.660 --> 21:36.761
What do you take me for?
