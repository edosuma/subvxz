01:39.206 --> 01:41.286
Hey, are you gooks almost done?

01:47.166 --> 01:48.406
Faggot.

01:58.246 --> 02:01.165
- You are big motherfucker, yes?
- Yeah.

02:20.288 --> 02:24.207
Just moments ago, a full-scale riot broke out
at Terminal Island Penitentiary.

02:24.608 --> 02:26.927
As far as I can tell,
there has been no action taken

02:27.007 --> 02:29.007
by Terminal Island Prison
correction officers.

02:29.087 --> 02:30.766
Lock down the bridge,
keep the tower guards.

02:30.847 --> 02:33.167
I want everyone else down here now.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.408
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:45.689 --> 02:48.287
Of course I'm serious!
Patch me live right fucking now!

02:49.009 --> 02:51.729
Either you take me live
or I tell your wife everything.

02:59.729 --> 03:00.848
You got that, right?

03:47.932 --> 03:49.492
What a shit match.

03:51.452 --> 03:53.131
I would never have bet
if I knew Spiro was injured.

03:53.891 --> 03:56.251
- But you did, huh?
- Yeah. Take your winnings.

03:57.332 --> 04:00.651
The whole world's falling apart,
and Manchester United with it.

04:03.572 --> 04:05.252
When I came over here,

04:05.334 --> 04:08.651
that clip was the first thing I ever bought
with my own money, you know?

04:09.693 --> 04:12.453
So, you take care of it. You look after it.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.533
Look at you, profiting off football.
He's never watched a match in his life.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.132
That's 'cause it's fucking boring, that's why.

04:19.213 --> 04:20.612
The world's greatest game.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.452
I think it's the third
world's greatest game, right?

04:25.572 --> 04:26.892
What the fuck are you laughing at?

04:28.412 --> 04:30.212
Excuse us, please.

04:36.054 --> 04:37.213
About the bank,

04:38.773 --> 04:39.813
it's important to me.

04:40.654 --> 04:42.213
I know it is.

04:42.334 --> 04:44.693
That's why I want to handle it my way,
with my guys.

04:44.774 --> 04:47.533
Well, Vinnie brought me this score.

04:48.294 --> 04:51.933
My stipulation is that you're in charge,
which is the way I want it.

04:52.254 --> 04:55.173
- Can I count on you?
- What do you think?

04:56.974 --> 04:57.973
Yeah.

04:58.693 --> 05:00.894
I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green,

05:00.975 --> 05:04.255
but what my nephew lacks in experience,
he makes up for with enthusiasm.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.495
Exactly what I'm worried about.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.375
Look, he fucks up, Mr. Kane,
he answers to me, okay?

05:11.375 --> 05:14.095
It's going to be all right, Luke. Trust me.

05:14.176 --> 05:15.335
Always do.

05:18.016 --> 05:19.334
I know you do.

05:19.615 --> 05:21.415
Come on. I've got something to show you.

05:30.256 --> 05:32.256
What do you think?

05:32.698 --> 05:34.296
This is for me?

05:35.017 --> 05:37.655
- You don't like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

05:37.736 --> 05:39.696
I just think, maybe, you know,
based on the kind of work I do,

05:39.776 --> 05:42.175
you don't think it's a bit orange?

05:42.257 --> 05:44.815
- You don't fucking like it.
- Are you kidding me?

05:44.897 --> 05:46.175
She's stunning.

05:48.337 --> 05:51.095
I just wonder, you think I might
stand out in this thing?

05:51.177 --> 05:53.615
No, the more obvious you are,
the less suspicious you appear.

05:54.016 --> 05:55.856
So, like, hiding in plain sight kind of thing.

05:55.937 --> 05:57.536
Precisely.

05:58.738 --> 06:00.378
Okay.

06:06.818 --> 06:08.617
Don't fuck it up.

06:50.339 --> 06:51.457
Thank you both for coming.

06:51.939 --> 06:54.739
Mr. Weyland, I'm not exactly sure
why she's here,

06:54.820 --> 06:58.179
but I know why I am, sir. I've failed you
and I've disgraced the corporation.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.619
Relax.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.299
I'm surprised those animals
don't kill each other with more regularity.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.379
You're both here
because this incident has created

07:05.459 --> 07:07.059
a public relations nightmare for me.

07:09.502 --> 07:11.139
Was something I said funny?

07:12.980 --> 07:15.700
Well, you had a 48 share.

07:16.581 --> 07:19.899
Your network's previous high was a seven.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.740
What you call a nightmare
I'd call a wet dream.

07:26.342 --> 07:30.661
Mr. Weyland, I know that the network
isn't your prime moneymaker.

07:31.901 --> 07:35.540
But I can't believe that you don't realise
what a gold mine you're sitting on.

07:36.421 --> 07:38.302
Humour me, Miss Jones.

07:38.422 --> 07:40.581
People are tired of fake violence

07:41.462 --> 07:44.181
and fights staged by Vegas promoters.

07:44.702 --> 07:46.901
The hatred that your inmates have

07:47.782 --> 07:51.141
is pure. Can't be duplicated.

07:52.862 --> 07:54.581
You're calling what happened today
entertainment?

07:54.661 --> 07:55.862
Ah!

07:58.943 --> 08:00.542
What exactly do you have in mind?

08:03.783 --> 08:05.222
VINNIE: No, seriously, I gotta tell you,

08:05.303 --> 08:08.661
this motherfucker's never carried a gun
in 20 years working for my uncle.

08:08.743 --> 08:10.582
- That right, Luke?
Vinnie, pay attention.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.062
You got 60 seconds. You get in, you get out.

08:13.304 --> 08:15.101
- No one gets hurt.
- We know. Don't worry.

08:46.263 --> 08:48.023
We got company. Get out of there.

08:48.224 --> 08:49.224
Vinnie, you copy?

08:49.304 --> 08:51.625
VINNIE: Don't worry about it, man.
Don't stress out.

08:52.586 --> 08:54.546
Look, abort. Get out of there.
- Chill, man.

08:54.665 --> 08:57.105
Jonesy, abort. Abort. Get out of there.

08:57.226 --> 08:58.785
- It's under control.
- Fuck.

09:07.306 --> 09:09.745
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!

09:10.306 --> 09:11.345
Freeze!

09:12.144 --> 09:14.025
- Freeze!
- What the fuck?

09:14.865 --> 09:15.905
Hey!

09:26.866 --> 09:27.906
Fucking idiot!

09:31.307 --> 09:32.586
Twenty years and nobody got hurt.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.387
You. Dumb fuck.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.946
We're leaving now! Move!

09:37.668 --> 09:38.867
- Shit!
- Fuck!

09:39.027 --> 09:41.426
- Shit! God damn it!
- Go, go, go, man!

09:41.907 --> 09:43.026
Come on, let's move!

09:43.947 --> 09:44.946
Fuck this, then.

09:49.747 --> 09:51.267
What are you looking at? Stop!

09:51.829 --> 09:53.067
You're crazy!

09:53.588 --> 09:55.187
- Move!
- OFFICER: Freeze!

10:38.150 --> 10:39.508
Let's get the fuck out of here!

10:56.591 --> 10:57.990
Go. Go, go, go, go!

10:58.071 --> 10:59.791
- Get in the fucking car, Vinnie.
- Right.

10:59.911 --> 11:01.230
- Move!
- Gotta go!

11:11.271 --> 11:12.310
VINNIE: What are you doing?
What are you doing?

11:12.431 --> 11:14.350
You're going to get us fucking killed,
like Terry.

11:17.392 --> 11:19.951
The only motherfucker that got Terry killed
was you. Fucking relax!

12:02.834 --> 12:04.113
We're gonna blast our way through.

12:04.314 --> 12:05.953
No one's getting blasted,
you fucking understand me?

12:09.594 --> 12:11.433
They're gaining on us.
Luke, fuck, I ain't getting pinched.

12:11.515 --> 12:13.313
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

12:42.434 --> 12:43.915
What the fuck was that for?

12:43.996 --> 12:45.795
- Fuck you.
- Drop the fucking gun.

12:46.276 --> 12:48.275
- Make a choice.
- Fuck.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.633
Your uncle is family.

12:50.715 --> 12:53.235
It's the only fucking reason
you guys are walking from this. Get out.

12:53.876 --> 12:55.075
Get out the fucking car!

13:13.078 --> 13:15.396
Chefs from Season 1
are back for redemption.

13:15.477 --> 13:17.036
...and it appears there's even more...

13:17.116 --> 13:19.156
...bank robbery suspect
is caught red-handed...

13:19.237 --> 13:21.796
Well, that's still
yet to be confirmed, I'm afraid, Ron,

13:21.878 --> 13:24.917
as busy King Street
is starting to get back to normal right now.

13:25.718 --> 13:29.397
Just a few hours ago, it was the scene
of high tension as gunfire rang...

13:48.758 --> 13:51.117
Ofthe foursuspects,
one has been identified

13:51.198 --> 13:53.198
as Carl Lucas, who is a known associate

13:53.280 --> 13:55.319
- of alleged crime boss Markus Kane.
- Fuck!

13:56.039 --> 13:59.598
- We will now take you live downtown...
- Fucking hell!

14:28.040 --> 14:29.118
Fuck!

14:53.801 --> 14:55.120
OFFICER 1: Stay where you are!

15:01.721 --> 15:02.921
OFFICER 2: Hands up!

15:08.761 --> 15:10.882
Take a last look at the mainland, boys.

15:10.962 --> 15:13.601
You ain't gonna see her again
once we cross this bridge.

15:13.682 --> 15:16.561
Bridges.
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest,

15:17.163 --> 15:18.522
38-and-a-half kilometres long,

15:18.922 --> 15:22.041
followed by Donghai Bridge,
32-and-a-half kilometres long.

15:22.123 --> 15:26.040
- The King Fahd Causeway comes in third.
- Fucking mumbling, stuttering bastard.

15:26.923 --> 15:29.281
- Could you shut the fuck up?
- Leave him alone.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.402
Prattling on every 10 minutes.

15:31.483 --> 15:34.323
- I'm getting sick and fucking tired of you.
- He's scared.

15:35.242 --> 15:36.803
What do you care?

15:38.284 --> 15:39.322
I don't.

15:47.084 --> 15:48.923
All right! Let's move!

15:51.803 --> 15:52.803
Get out! Get out!

15:53.723 --> 15:56.882
Move! Come on, move!
Get out here! Get out here!

15:58.123 --> 15:59.482
Get the fuck off me.

16:00.285 --> 16:01.443
OFFICER: Come on, get out. Come on now.

17:16.328 --> 17:19.487
I will not testify. Never.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.486
The DA's gonna pull his offer, Luke.

17:22.087 --> 17:24.806
Kane'll walk away scot-free,
and you'll go away for life.

17:25.848 --> 17:28.727
You see, I'm not gonna testify
against Markus Kane.

17:28.808 --> 17:31.688
Not for immunity, not for money,

17:34.528 --> 17:35.927
not for anything.

17:43.849 --> 17:46.409
We have some good news, Mr. Kane.
We found Luke.

17:47.288 --> 17:49.888
- He's on the Island.
- That is good news.

17:51.489 --> 17:52.647
Always knew I could trust that guy.

17:53.529 --> 17:56.168
I told you. No way would he betray me.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.690
Have him taken out.

18:04.410 --> 18:05.928
You're joking, right?

18:06.010 --> 18:07.969
So far, he hasn't played ball with the feds.

18:08.809 --> 18:12.050
He's in for life. What happens
after a month of hard time, eh?

18:12.650 --> 18:15.050
After a couple of them African apes
have a go at him.

18:15.610 --> 18:18.090
How long do you think
he's gonna stay loyal then?

18:18.490 --> 18:20.609
You know, it's a shame,

18:22.170 --> 18:24.169
'cause I love that guy like a brother.

18:28.971 --> 18:30.330
Anything else?

18:30.891 --> 18:31.890
No, sir.

18:34.372 --> 18:36.610
- What else do you want on this?
- It's perfect.

18:36.691 --> 18:38.691
- Yeah? Here, then.
- Thank you.

19:18.614 --> 19:19.891
Fuck you!

19:32.694 --> 19:35.092
The average Death Match fight
garners a 50 share.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.694
It peaked two months ago at 62,
but has been on the decline since.

19:39.134 --> 19:42.133
The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill,
with a death count of 19,

19:42.213 --> 19:43.414
followed by 14K,

19:44.134 --> 19:46.492
- who, coincidentally, has 14 kills.
- Great, man.

19:46.974 --> 19:48.052
Someone did their homework, right?

19:48.533 --> 19:49.973
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

19:52.294 --> 19:55.134
LISTS: That's September Jones.
Former Miss Universe.

19:55.575 --> 19:59.493
Was stripped of her crown after allegations
of a sexual relationship with all five judges.

19:59.774 --> 20:01.854
Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting
as a weather girl,

20:02.055 --> 20:04.535
is now the host and executive producer
of Death Match.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.175
She grew a...

20:07.416 --> 20:09.975
You have a list pretty much ready to go
on anything, don't you?

20:12.096 --> 20:16.215
Live from Terminal Island,
television's most violent, most disturbing,

20:16.295 --> 20:18.694
and most watched programme
in human history.

20:19.496 --> 20:21.415
Welcome to Death Match.

20:21.977 --> 20:27.016
Our first fighter, a murderer serving
four consecutive life sentences,

20:27.497 --> 20:29.975
Xander Grady!

20:30.376 --> 20:33.897
Xander,
11 kills, one submission.

20:34.777 --> 20:37.495
6'4", 220 pounds.

20:39.416 --> 20:42.975
His opponent,
leader of the Terminal Island Triads,

20:43.176 --> 20:45.495
he currently ranks second on the kill board,

20:45.575 --> 20:49.816
he was Interpol's third most wanted
until his arrest in Los Angeles last year,

20:50.218 --> 20:51.656
14K!

20:52.058 --> 20:57.016
14K one submission, 14 kills.

20:57.858 --> 21:00.536
5'11 ", 159 pounds.

21:02.058 --> 21:05.057
The combatants are picked by lottery
randomly each week.

21:05.498 --> 21:09.337
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.

21:09.418 --> 21:12.137
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,

21:12.258 --> 21:15.097
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

21:15.178 --> 21:18.178
But they only have 10 seconds
to access them.

21:18.339 --> 21:21.019
If no fighter has won,
both fighters are killed.

21:21.099 --> 21:24.138
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

21:32.099 --> 21:35.498
You're number one!

21:36.059 --> 21:38.018
Yo, baby, you're my number one!

21:39.660 --> 21:41.018
Chinese bastard!

22:11.979 --> 22:12.939
Something's not right.

22:14.381 --> 22:15.781
What're you talking about?

22:19.462 --> 22:21.060
Die!

23:07.183 --> 23:12.902
14K! 14K! 14K! 14K!

23:17.105 --> 23:18.663
You want it? Huh?

23:23.664 --> 23:24.904
Let go, man!

23:26.545 --> 23:27.945
I will never give up!

23:38.024 --> 23:39.622
- He quit!
- No!

23:40.625 --> 23:42.664
Another fucking submission!

23:43.345 --> 23:44.423
He quit!

23:45.906 --> 23:48.145
-14K! 14K!
Tonight's winner,

23:49.545 --> 23:51.464
14K!

23:55.786 --> 23:58.785
Death Match is a trademark
of Weyland International.

23:58.866 --> 24:03.105
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

24:10.226 --> 24:13.025
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you are doing?

24:14.227 --> 24:15.586
You are done.

24:15.667 --> 24:16.706
Done!

24:32.947 --> 24:34.306
Lights out!

24:50.028 --> 24:51.107
Hey, baby.

24:51.188 --> 24:53.427
The numbers from the overnights are in.

24:55.908 --> 24:57.707
What do I pay you for?

24:58.188 --> 25:00.788
The ratings are down again. This time, 20%.

25:01.988 --> 25:05.267
Now, you better reverse the trend,
or I'll find someone who can.

25:06.228 --> 25:07.508
Are you sure?

25:11.470 --> 25:15.149
Yes, I'm sure. Now, you make my
motherfucking money. You understand me?

25:24.749 --> 25:26.509
LISTS: It's a strict Triad code.

25:26.949 --> 25:30.668
Whoever spills the blood of a Triad,
they're sworn to take that person's life.

25:30.949 --> 25:32.628
Xander killed a Triad last match.

25:32.709 --> 25:35.028
It defies logic why he wouldn't kill him
if he had the chance.

25:35.190 --> 25:37.189
Hey, kid,
I'm not looking for a best friend, okay?

25:37.271 --> 25:38.709
So, just leave me alone.

26:09.392 --> 26:10.790
Carl Lucas.

26:11.031 --> 26:13.511
- Chill. Chill, man.
Relax.

26:14.552 --> 26:16.471
You've been assigned to our work detail.

26:16.551 --> 26:17.711
That's Rocco,

26:18.232 --> 26:19.232
I'm Goldberg.

26:20.513 --> 26:22.072
- Goldberg, huh?
- Yeah.

26:22.152 --> 26:24.631
What are you, like, the...
You, like, the last Mexican Jew, or what?

26:25.792 --> 26:27.831
Yeah. I killed all the rest.

26:29.632 --> 26:32.430
Okay. So, this work detail,
what are we looking at?

26:32.953 --> 26:34.552
And don't tell me we're washing underwear.

26:35.154 --> 26:36.991
No.
- I don't care what you're into.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.032
I'm not washing anybody's underwear.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.353
On your feet, Lucas. Warden wants you.

27:12.914 --> 27:13.914
That'll be all.

27:16.314 --> 27:20.073
Carl Lucas, arrested 22 times
over a span of 20 years.

27:20.675 --> 27:22.833
But nothing ever stuck,
not a single damn one.

27:23.995 --> 27:25.553
You just slipped through the cracks.

27:27.554 --> 27:28.713
Well, I shot a cop.

27:29.635 --> 27:31.554
Those cracks, they fill up pretty fast.

27:31.955 --> 27:33.314
They sure do. Yeah.

27:34.835 --> 27:36.635
Now, at first I didn't realise who you were.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.354
Really? So, who am I?

27:39.995 --> 27:42.154
Well, an idiot, and soon a dead man.

27:43.115 --> 27:45.675
DA offers you a talk-and-walk,
and you turn him down?

27:46.317 --> 27:47.756
Is that why you got me here?

27:47.996 --> 27:49.915
No, it's not. I'm here to warn you.

27:50.276 --> 27:52.555
- Save your breath.
- Oh, don't get smart with me.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.394
I don't know how many others know
who you are,

27:54.595 --> 27:55.834
but when the word gets out,

27:56.276 --> 27:58.195
the killers are gonna be
coming out of the woodwork.

27:58.956 --> 27:59.956
Is that right?

28:01.837 --> 28:02.835
And mark my words,

28:02.917 --> 28:05.797
Markus Kane will not show you the
same type of loyalty that you've shown him.

28:20.317 --> 28:23.876
Look, 14K kills Xander,

28:24.278 --> 28:25.995
he makes him a martyr. That's like an honour.

28:26.597 --> 28:30.237
Xander quits,
shames himself and the entire brotherhood.

28:30.798 --> 28:33.238
That makes him like a pussy.

28:34.118 --> 28:35.237
You got him, guys?

28:36.158 --> 28:37.157
Yeah.

28:37.918 --> 28:38.918
Oh, man.

28:39.158 --> 28:41.837
I got a question. All these cars, man,
it's not exactly prison norm.

28:41.918 --> 28:42.958
What's the deal?

28:43.278 --> 28:46.758
Hey, Terminal Island is not
about rehabilitation. You know what I mean?

28:47.559 --> 28:51.277
It's a business.
All these cars, we melt them down,

28:51.358 --> 28:53.918
make weapons, guns, shells.

28:53.998 --> 28:56.558
If it kills, we make it.

28:57.399 --> 29:01.118
Hey, are you telling me the government's
paying top dollar for this recycled shit?

29:01.199 --> 29:03.718
Top dollar?
Who said anything about top dollar?

29:03.800 --> 29:06.518
Weyland International sells this stuff
dirt-cheap.

29:06.599 --> 29:07.879
Yeah, when you're not paying for labour,

29:07.959 --> 29:10.079
your prices can afford to be a little lower,
you know what I mean?

29:10.719 --> 29:12.559
They're making
money off our blood.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.000
- What do you know about these wheels?
- A little bit.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.839
- How does she run?
- Why don't you see what she's got?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.520
- For real?
- For real.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.599
Why not?

30:37.804 --> 30:39.804
Someone's been
driving a getaway car!

30:41.004 --> 30:43.282
God damn,
you put some magic in this thing.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.403
- How does she handle?
- Just the way she's supposed to.

30:46.843 --> 30:47.963
Who was driving that car?

30:48.964 --> 30:50.162
- What car?
- What car?

31:00.445 --> 31:02.124
Hey, Luke, you a fighter?

31:02.605 --> 31:04.283
I got no reason to fight anyone.

31:05.005 --> 31:07.364
Hey, reasons don't mean shit in this place.

31:08.365 --> 31:09.924
The Calendar's always looking
for new blood,

31:10.006 --> 31:11.885
and you look like just her type.

31:12.325 --> 31:13.524
Good to know.

31:22.406 --> 31:26.445
Some advice, blend in.
Don't give her no reason to fixate on you.

31:26.726 --> 31:29.364
Hey, Goldberg, I'm the last guy
looking for a fucking spotlight.

31:32.446 --> 31:33.565
- Hey!
- Hey!

31:35.126 --> 31:36.606
OFFICER: Stay back! Stay back!

31:37.007 --> 31:38.085
Everybody else stay back!

31:40.447 --> 31:41.646
I don't want you in there. Move back.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.925
All of you, stay back! Let's go! Move back!

32:01.166 --> 32:03.007
- What's going on here?
- Big guy tripped.

32:03.168 --> 32:05.808
- That so, Bill?
- Yeah, I tripped.

32:07.248 --> 32:08.367
That's what he says.

32:08.848 --> 32:10.127
All right, let's go! Keep it moving!

32:10.208 --> 32:11.767
Come on, move!
Get moving! Move! Move!

32:12.808 --> 32:13.846
Who's the little guy?

32:14.087 --> 32:16.047
- His name's Lists.
- Lists?

32:17.608 --> 32:19.367
You'll work it out.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.288
You ever hear of a computer?
You're, like, a century behind everyone.

32:25.489 --> 32:27.488
I'm surprised I don't find an abacus in here.

32:27.569 --> 32:29.927
- What are you doing in my office?
- I'm here for him.

32:31.088 --> 32:32.848
Carl Lucas.
Even the name gives me a hard-on.

32:33.649 --> 32:37.569
The judge called him a monster at his trial.
He's perfect.

32:38.249 --> 32:39.968
- I can sell him.
- You can't have him.

32:40.049 --> 32:42.768
- I wasn't asking your permission.
- Wait. There's more to it.

32:43.089 --> 32:44.527
DA thinks there's a chance

32:45.729 --> 32:48.488
that he could turn state witness
against Markus Kane.

32:48.570 --> 32:51.850
Now, you put him on your TV show,

32:51.930 --> 32:53.369
not only could those animals kill him,

32:53.810 --> 32:58.448
but basically, he just advertises to Kane
where the chief witness against him sleeps,

32:59.170 --> 33:00.569
and then he's a dead man.

33:02.090 --> 33:03.691
Mr. Lucas' problem, not mine.

33:04.690 --> 33:07.409
Warden Parks, you and your prison
exist for one reason,

33:08.369 --> 33:10.329
to facilitate Death Match.

33:11.170 --> 33:14.288
And here I thought we were here
to protect society and punish criminals.

33:15.530 --> 33:17.289
Then you're dumber than I thought.

34:04.134 --> 34:05.731
Give us a minute.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.531
Would you like a towel?

34:13.612 --> 34:14.973
I'm fine.

34:15.773 --> 34:17.053
Yeah, I'll say.

34:18.813 --> 34:20.493
Very impressive.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.253
And your fight with Big Bill yesterday,

34:25.092 --> 34:27.054
also impressive.

34:28.574 --> 34:30.813
- I don't think we've met. I'm...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

34:32.734 --> 34:34.132
Save the sales pitch, huh?

34:34.454 --> 34:35.493
I'm not fighting.

34:38.014 --> 34:39.773
If I want you to fight, you fight.

34:39.853 --> 34:41.172
- Is that right?
- Yes.

34:42.494 --> 34:44.734
I can't do anything about the life sentences,

34:45.855 --> 34:47.215
but you participate,

34:48.255 --> 34:50.733
and I will make your life here
much more tolerable.

34:53.215 --> 34:55.534
Your own cell, no work detail,

34:57.176 --> 34:58.375
real food,

35:00.575 --> 35:01.934
as well as plenty of

35:07.495 --> 35:09.374
- perks.
- Okay.

35:11.456 --> 35:12.695
So, I...

35:17.776 --> 35:19.895
I win some fights for you,

35:21.217 --> 35:23.495
you need another guy to beat me.

35:26.216 --> 35:27.456
I mean, that's...

35:28.857 --> 35:30.016
That's how it works, right?

35:32.376 --> 35:33.416
Yeah.

35:35.937 --> 35:37.135
Okay.

35:39.777 --> 35:40.816
Hey,

35:42.097 --> 35:44.136
go sell sleazy someplace else,

35:46.898 --> 35:48.057
'cause I ain't buying.

35:49.778 --> 35:52.536
- You won't leave me any choice.
- Do what you gotta do.

35:53.378 --> 35:54.777
I'm not gonna be a part of your freak show.

35:55.978 --> 35:57.337
We'll see.

36:00.898 --> 36:02.257
Hey.

36:03.097 --> 36:04.978
You don't hear the word "no" so often,
do you?

36:05.818 --> 36:07.417
Only when I say it.

36:12.338 --> 36:15.418
Dim the lights,
the carnage is about to begin.

36:16.059 --> 36:18.738
Good evening,
and welcome to Death Match.

36:20.219 --> 36:24.299
Two men will be randomly selected live,
right before your eyes.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.339
Only the winner walks out alive.

36:27.179 --> 36:29.698
Are there any fighters in here tonight?

36:45.221 --> 36:46.579
I need one more.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.579
No! No!

36:58.660 --> 36:59.860
This is fucking bullshit.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.979
Welcome to Death Match.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.540
Hey! Hey, lady. Okay, you made your point.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.260
- Switch us up.
- Oh, so now you wanna fight?

37:09.421 --> 37:11.461
Fucking right. They're gonna kill him
in there, you know that.

37:11.541 --> 37:13.862
Yeah, I certainly hope so.
The name of the game is Death Match.

37:13.983 --> 37:15.181
What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:15.261 --> 37:17.620
Hey! Get your fucking hands...

37:18.501 --> 37:21.861
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.

37:22.343 --> 37:24.580
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,

37:24.662 --> 37:27.261
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

37:27.742 --> 37:31.621
And this week, we have a new weapon
that will blow your mind.

37:35.383 --> 37:36.421
Come on!

37:43.983 --> 37:45.022
Fuck him up, Bill!

37:48.903 --> 37:50.422
Come on! Come on!

37:55.743 --> 37:56.942
Mother...

38:04.943 --> 38:06.462
Motherfucker's crazy!

38:06.784 --> 38:07.863
But cool.

38:19.145 --> 38:21.064
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I want on the floor. Can you help?

38:31.264 --> 38:32.263
LISTS: Get him, Luke!

38:57.426 --> 38:58.424
LISTS: Watch out!

38:59.466 --> 39:00.465
Watch out!

39:11.867 --> 39:13.465
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

39:17.228 --> 39:18.305
Don't look good for our boy.

39:23.827 --> 39:25.826
LISTS: This way! This way! Come on!

39:30.227 --> 39:31.627
The door, Luke! The door!

39:32.148 --> 39:35.147
This is some bullshit! This game is rigged!

39:37.268 --> 39:39.787
Barbecue his white ass!
Yo, the white boy's cheating!

39:39.908 --> 39:42.706
- Fucking cracker's cheating!
- Fuck you, you nigger!

39:42.868 --> 39:44.428
- You piece of shit!
- Watch out!

39:55.587 --> 39:56.587
BIG BILL: Come on!

40:04.990 --> 40:06.069
Come on! Let's get in there!

40:08.949 --> 40:11.548
Come on, come on! Go, go! Get out there!

40:12.230 --> 40:13.229
I told you.

40:19.390 --> 40:20.949
Switch!

40:41.591 --> 40:42.591
Go, go, go!

40:52.511 --> 40:55.190
Get the fuck over here!
Come on! Come on!

40:55.351 --> 40:56.350
Get back.

41:01.233 --> 41:02.230
LISTS: Watch out, Luke!

41:26.392 --> 41:27.671
Get ready to scream, bitch!

41:35.193 --> 41:36.712
Fuck you!
- Who's screaming now, bitch?

41:37.113 --> 41:38.393
Code red, arena stage.

41:38.834 --> 41:41.273
- End transmission now.
- Are you fucking crazy?

41:41.354 --> 41:43.713
- Shut it down.
- No way. This is my show.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.392
And this is my prison.
End this broadcast now

41:46.473 --> 41:48.673
or you're gonna be one of the cons
instead ofjust filming them.

41:48.834 --> 41:49.832
Got it.

41:49.914 --> 41:52.192
Death Match is a trademark
of Weyland International.

41:52.273 --> 41:55.073
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

41:58.475 --> 41:59.593
OFFICER: Get on the ground!

42:01.675 --> 42:02.674
Luke!

42:04.994 --> 42:06.074
OFFICER: Come on, get on the bus!

42:09.475 --> 42:11.073
You wanna live? Stay down.

42:43.755 --> 42:44.996
Wasn't that Luke?

42:46.956 --> 42:47.956
What?

42:49.915 --> 42:50.955
Fuck!

42:51.596 --> 42:52.795
Get me the phone!

42:53.477 --> 42:54.475
Fuck.

42:55.316 --> 42:57.797
Just relax, huh? Just relax.
Won't hurt a bit. Relax.

42:59.916 --> 43:01.155
Any closer, buddy...

43:01.237 --> 43:03.717
You're really lucky,
or this would have hit the femoral artery.

43:04.077 --> 43:07.597
- Yeah, that's me. Lucky.
- Yeah. You can say that.

43:08.918 --> 43:12.036
Man!
- Just relax. Relax.

43:14.477 --> 43:18.236
It's a minor setback.
A few rapists and murderers died. Boo-hoo.

43:18.436 --> 43:19.796
No. This is the end.

43:20.278 --> 43:22.876
You messed it up by pulling the plug.
We would've won the night.

43:24.438 --> 43:26.637
You're not good enough in bed
to win this one.

43:29.599 --> 43:30.958
Sweet dreams.

43:41.278 --> 43:42.198
OFFICER: Come on, over here.

43:43.398 --> 43:44.397
Fuck.

43:44.959 --> 43:46.597
OFFICER: Sit down there and shut up.

43:49.199 --> 43:50.839
- OFFICER: Quiet down.
- Hey.

43:51.518 --> 43:52.598
What happened?

43:53.560 --> 43:55.439
You're not the only one
that got in some good shots.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.278
- I know.
All right, ladies! Line it up!

43:59.640 --> 44:02.038
The bus is leaving.
Don't make me tell you twice!

44:06.600 --> 44:07.719
- Hey.
- OFFICER: Let's go.

44:08.281 --> 44:10.118
- Thanks, huh?
- OFFICER: Step through, ladies!

44:10.640 --> 44:12.159
Yeah. I don't know why I did it.

44:12.841 --> 44:14.598
Probably get thrown in the hole for that.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.479
Then why?

44:19.320 --> 44:20.759
Why did you help that con?

44:22.041 --> 44:24.480
Wasn't gonna let the man fight my fight.

44:25.722 --> 44:27.399
OFFICER: Right this way. Let's go.

44:32.322 --> 44:33.320
You got a name?

44:33.642 --> 44:36.000
Uh-huh. Yeah. Of course I do.

44:40.360 --> 44:41.440
Come on, man.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.521
There he is.

44:50.122 --> 44:51.602
How the fuck is he still alive?

44:51.683 --> 44:53.201
Boss, we've been
assured it's happening.

44:53.282 --> 44:54.840
It's been happening for weeks now.

44:55.202 --> 44:57.122
How much longer
do you think he's gonna stay silent?

44:57.203 --> 44:59.121
He's a tough guy, and he's been loyal...

44:59.202 --> 45:01.001
I want him dead!

45:01.083 --> 45:03.242
We have someone on the inside,
a total psycho.

45:03.482 --> 45:05.322
- It won't take long now.
- Joey. Joey.

45:06.122 --> 45:10.842
The box, with its implications
of rigidity and squareness,

45:11.643 --> 45:15.682
symbolises unimaginative thinking
and painful frustration.

45:23.563 --> 45:25.763
Sometimes
we just have to step back,

45:25.844 --> 45:28.683
see if the solutions to our problem
lies outside the box.

45:30.524 --> 45:31.524
Call a meeting.

45:33.484 --> 45:35.202
- With who?
- Everyone!

45:37.325 --> 45:40.203
- You didn't return my calls.
- I don't return a lot of calls.

45:40.284 --> 45:42.442
I wanna discuss Death Match.
I think that we should pull the plug.

45:42.764 --> 45:45.523
When a real-life riot doesn't generate
a second-hour boost,

45:45.884 --> 45:49.524
- I'd say it's time to cut your loss.
- Exactly. We need to evolve.

45:49.604 --> 45:52.403
We've developed a strong base,
we have legitimate TV stars...

45:52.484 --> 45:55.004
The board's decision is final, Miss Jones.

45:58.485 --> 46:01.364
In the past six months, I'm the only
profitable thing about this company.

46:01.925 --> 46:05.203
Unless you want a sexual harassment suit
crammed down your throat,

46:05.285 --> 46:07.204
you will listen to what I have to say.

46:17.727 --> 46:18.725
Fine.

46:20.127 --> 46:21.685
9:00 a. m. tomorrow.

46:47.928 --> 46:49.127
I'm troubled.

46:50.487 --> 46:54.687
What seemed to be a very simple task
has taken the most perplexing of turns.

46:57.208 --> 46:58.406
So I'm gonna speak slowly,

46:59.328 --> 47:00.407
clearly,

47:01.687 --> 47:04.726
so my message is not lost, or ignored,
or misinterpreted.

47:07.567 --> 47:10.407
One million dollars to the man
who kills Carl Lucas.

47:12.528 --> 47:15.249
This offer expires in 48 hours,
and if that happens,

47:16.729 --> 47:18.687
I will consider you all enemies,

47:19.929 --> 47:22.007
and I will bring war on your fucking head.

47:23.729 --> 47:25.008
Understand?

47:30.329 --> 47:31.768
Ninety percent
of Terminal Island,

47:31.849 --> 47:34.688
your grand investment, is dead space.

47:35.049 --> 47:37.168
Death Match merely stayed your execution.

47:37.248 --> 47:40.208
If you wanna get a breath of fresh air,
you need a bold initiative.

47:40.449 --> 47:41.968
I propose a race.

47:42.930 --> 47:44.010
Wicked. Epic.

47:44.850 --> 47:47.130
Something like no one has ever seen before.

47:50.050 --> 47:52.048
The track will run the length
of Terminal Island

47:52.130 --> 47:54.330
along some of the narrowest
and most harrowing paths

47:54.411 --> 47:55.610
that the racing world has to offer.

47:56.250 --> 47:59.930
The best part of it, everything that we need
is right in our own backyard.

48:00.530 --> 48:02.168
We're gonna modify each vehicle,

48:02.290 --> 48:05.328
adding reinforced steel plating,
bulletproof glass, and roll cages

48:05.410 --> 48:07.569
to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.

48:07.890 --> 48:09.490
We'll take everything
that made Death Match a hit,

48:10.051 --> 48:12.049
combine it with everything
we have at our disposal.

48:12.852 --> 48:13.850
Such as?

48:13.931 --> 48:15.210
Heavy fucking artillery.

48:19.370 --> 48:22.771
Every car will hold as many
guns and as much ammunition as it can.

48:25.091 --> 48:27.372
So, you're going to arm the prisoners.

48:27.651 --> 48:31.170
Precautions will be made to make sure
they can only shoot at people on the track.

48:33.012 --> 48:36.530
Nine cars, three days,
20,000 rounds of ammunition.

48:40.692 --> 48:42.931
Going from fighting to racing,
that's a big leap.

48:44.333 --> 48:48.010
We need a hook.
Something that incorporates the two better.

48:48.572 --> 48:53.691
Now, in a game show, no one cares
about the game. The game's arbitrary.

48:54.133 --> 48:56.811
People care about the risk and the money.

48:57.133 --> 49:01.011
Now, we've been concentrating on the game,
not the risk.

49:01.413 --> 49:02.931
That's why our audience is bored.

49:03.293 --> 49:05.092
Let's concentrate on the prize.

49:05.412 --> 49:08.252
A prize more valuable than money.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.733
Okay. What's more valuable than money?

49:14.014 --> 49:15.213
Life

49:16.215 --> 49:18.133
is a more valuable prize than money.

49:18.614 --> 49:21.173
In our deal with the state,
we control sentencing.

49:21.415 --> 49:23.334
That means we control their life.

49:23.414 --> 49:26.454
So if a prisoner wins five races,
he gets his freedom.

49:26.534 --> 49:30.533
No matter what he's in for,
robbery, rape, homicide, whatever,

49:31.574 --> 49:33.133
he wins his freedom.

49:33.933 --> 49:35.253
He wins his life.

49:35.975 --> 49:37.293
You have life,

49:39.256 --> 49:40.214
freedom.

49:43.335 --> 49:44.335
Stop.

49:49.136 --> 49:50.455
Death Race.

49:57.415 --> 50:00.133
You know what?
That's fucking bullshit, Rocco.

50:00.535 --> 50:02.135
Well, how do you know, man?
Maybe it's for real.

50:02.215 --> 50:03.174
Are you kidding me?

50:03.256 --> 50:06.294
You think they're gonna let murderers
and rapists out of this place, ever?

50:06.376 --> 50:07.976
Hey, Luke's right.

50:08.058 --> 50:10.856
And besides that, homes,
you don't drive worth a shit.

50:10.938 --> 50:13.015
You know what? Fucking blow me.

50:16.697 --> 50:17.976
Fucking faggot.

50:19.896 --> 50:22.456
That would be the only chance I have
of getting out.

50:24.017 --> 50:26.095
And what would you do, Lists,
if you got out?

50:29.737 --> 50:31.096
Start over.

50:38.138 --> 50:40.297
Welcome to Death Race.

50:40.377 --> 50:45.017
Terminal Island Penitentiary hosts
three days of the ultimate in auto carnage.

50:45.098 --> 50:47.337
Day one of the race begins in 10 minutes,

50:47.498 --> 50:49.618
and will be brought to you
without commercial interruption

50:49.739 --> 50:54.137
by Weyland International.
Your safety is our top priority.

50:54.297 --> 50:57.137
Get ready. The show's about to begin.

51:11.979 --> 51:14.618
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

51:15.099 --> 51:18.218
Welcome to day one
of Death Race.

51:18.740 --> 51:21.299
Before you, 18 cons vie for their freedom.

51:22.139 --> 51:25.659
They must survive all three laps
in order to proceed to day two.

51:26.298 --> 51:27.578
Their first challenge?

51:28.179 --> 51:30.099
There are only nine cars.

51:30.740 --> 51:33.338
That's right, gentlemen. Nine cars!

51:34.301 --> 51:37.499
Three, two, one,

51:38.780 --> 51:39.739
go!

52:07.901 --> 52:09.339
This is what I'm talking about!

52:13.182 --> 52:14.141
Mine!

52:17.302 --> 52:19.421
This just keeps getting better and better!

52:19.582 --> 52:22.301
- Hey, baby.
- How about a bit v rodet?

52:40.943 --> 52:42.302
Oh, baby, yeah!

52:50.062 --> 52:51.382
Don't think so!

52:54.903 --> 52:56.222
Why did you let that con beat you?

52:58.302 --> 53:00.143
- Shit!
- Hang on!

53:07.584 --> 53:08.623
- Fuck!
- Hey, why do I need this?

53:08.704 --> 53:10.944
- You mind helping me out with this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Who am I talking to?

53:11.104 --> 53:13.023
- To talk to your pit team.
- Pit team?

53:13.104 --> 53:14.904
Luke! Good to have you, man.

53:15.423 --> 53:18.943
So, you got your guns, your oil, your smoke,
and your napalm here.

53:19.904 --> 53:22.303
- Get your eyes on the road.
- Let's race.

53:36.825 --> 53:38.305
Luke! Goldberg.

53:38.625 --> 53:41.985
Yeah. The Mexican Jew's here
to save your bony white ass.

53:42.466 --> 53:44.824
Now, swords and shields don't play
until the second lap.

53:45.466 --> 53:48.784
You've got the fastest car out there,
except the Porsche.

53:49.106 --> 53:51.584
And don't go head-to-head with that Ram,
or he'll have you for lunch.

53:52.865 --> 53:53.946
Son of a bitch!

53:59.107 --> 54:01.105
Looks like we're already on the menu.

54:04.466 --> 54:05.466
Eat this.

54:07.747 --> 54:08.706
You feel me, baby?

54:11.747 --> 54:14.306
- BIG BILL: Now I got you, baby!
- Is that all you got, pretty boy?

54:14.388 --> 54:15.586
Careful of the one on the right!

54:16.346 --> 54:17.346
Good to know.

54:26.147 --> 54:28.228
- Yeah! That's my man!
- Yes!

54:33.668 --> 54:35.748
- Where is he? Where is he?
- To the left.

54:37.468 --> 54:38.907
Xander Grady.

54:40.468 --> 54:42.628
Come on!
Get it going!

54:50.788 --> 54:53.427
Fucking Chinese bastard! I'll kill you!

54:56.389 --> 54:57.429
Shit! Bastard!

54:58.470 --> 54:59.428
Motherfucker!

55:07.749 --> 55:11.269
That was a great lap, Luke, but now
you need to get to a sword plate, and fast.

55:11.589 --> 55:12.629
Activate swords, shields and death heads.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.149
Sword pressure plates activated.

55:14.310 --> 55:15.749
Shield pressure plates activated.

55:17.190 --> 55:19.829
You gotta find a sword, Luke.
You gotta find a sword plate.

55:20.390 --> 55:22.468
That's right. Get back to work.

55:22.950 --> 55:23.989
There's one!

55:24.471 --> 55:25.830
- I see it.
- Go for it. Go for it!

55:30.390 --> 55:31.749
Sword pressure plate activated.

55:32.390 --> 55:33.910
HILLBILLY: Yeah!
How do you like that one, boy?

55:35.912 --> 55:38.630
What the hell is he doing?

55:39.911 --> 55:40.990
- Oh, jeez!
- Guns! Guns!

55:42.230 --> 55:44.829
Eat my lead, boy! Eat my lead!

55:49.031 --> 55:50.150
Get down! Now!

55:50.271 --> 55:51.830
- Hey, get out of there!
Get down!

55:54.592 --> 55:55.911
How's it feel, boy?

55:56.072 --> 55:57.191
You gotta turn here!

56:00.232 --> 56:01.311
I'm working on it.

56:05.472 --> 56:06.592
Hang on.

56:13.032 --> 56:15.271
God! Oh, God, no!

56:19.512 --> 56:20.711
Yeah!

56:21.513 --> 56:23.633
- Ooh, yeah!
That was close.

56:25.033 --> 56:27.192
Stock car racing
got its start during Prohibition

56:27.274 --> 56:29.911
with moonshine runners
fleeing federal agents.

56:30.393 --> 56:35.432
Bill France Sr. conceived NASCAR in 1947
during a meeting in Daytona, Florida.

56:37.113 --> 56:39.232
"Lists. " I get it now.

56:49.194 --> 56:50.595
Shield pressure plates activated.

57:02.116 --> 57:03.113
Motherfucker.

57:29.677 --> 57:31.915
- Get a close-up on that.
Camera two, move to your left.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.554
Where did he go? Huh?

57:41.356 --> 57:42.315
Where did he go?

57:45.516 --> 57:46.755
You ain't escaping me now.

57:48.877 --> 57:50.956
A million dollars. It's gonna be mine.

57:51.277 --> 57:52.356
What did he just say?

57:53.037 --> 57:53.996
Replay that for me.

57:54.116 --> 57:56.837
BIG BILL: A million dollars.
It's gonna be mine.

57:58.158 --> 57:59.277
I'll take care of it.

58:11.877 --> 58:12.877
Take the wheel.

58:25.959 --> 58:27.038
Take that, bitch.
Think you're special?

58:29.118 --> 58:30.118
No!

58:31.119 --> 58:32.557
No! No!

58:39.278 --> 58:40.318
No!

59:03.759 --> 59:05.359
One lap to go, Luke. This is it.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.880
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.

59:09.320 --> 59:10.320
Oh, yeah!

59:13.201 --> 59:14.160
Yeah!

59:14.881 --> 59:16.241
- Damn it!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!

59:17.001 --> 59:18.160
Enough of this shit.

59:24.682 --> 59:26.120
- What the hell?
- Hang on.

59:26.921 --> 59:28.400
Stay with me. Stay with me.

59:29.201 --> 59:30.320
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

59:43.041 --> 59:45.042
Yeah! All right! All right!

59:45.283 --> 59:46.562
Bullshit, motherfucker!

59:47.442 --> 59:48.521
That's it. That's it.

59:50.122 --> 59:51.601
Sword pressure plate activated.

59:54.483 --> 59:55.442
Not that one!

59:56.723 --> 59:58.282
Did you just drop our fucking tombstone?

01:00:00.403 --> 01:00:01.361
Yeah, my bad.

01:00:02.643 --> 01:00:03.681
Not good.

01:00:04.482 --> 01:00:05.522
What you doing?

01:00:05.762 --> 01:00:07.522
- What you doing?
- Drive, pretty boy.

01:00:09.803 --> 01:00:10.802
"Pretty boy. "

01:00:11.282 --> 01:00:14.124
God damn this fucking car!

01:00:16.243 --> 01:00:17.202
Hang on!

01:00:19.564 --> 01:00:20.883
Take this, you asshole!

01:00:21.364 --> 01:00:22.564
- Eat that!
- Fuck!

01:00:23.044 --> 01:00:25.364
- Hang on!
- KATRINA: You're going down!

01:00:25.683 --> 01:00:26.642
That's nice work.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:27.923
Talk to me!

01:00:33.443 --> 01:00:34.482
Now you're going down!

01:00:40.725 --> 01:00:41.684
Sweet!

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.923
I guess I lucked out, then.

01:00:44.884 --> 01:00:45.924
Nice.

01:00:46.085 --> 01:00:48.883
- Guess we put that magic to work, Goldberg.
- Well, bravo!

01:00:49.285 --> 01:00:50.484
Come on, Luke! Yeah!

01:00:50.645 --> 01:00:53.204
The debut
of Death Race is in the books.

01:00:53.285 --> 01:00:55.444
CarI Lucas is the surprise winner,

01:00:55.525 --> 01:01:00.644
followed by Big Bill, Calin, Apache,
Xander and 14K.

01:01:01.485 --> 01:01:04.405
Can CarI Lucas hold on to win his freedom?

01:01:04.565 --> 01:01:07.124
Tune in tomorrow to find out.

01:01:16.565 --> 01:01:17.685
Yeah! Yeah!

01:01:20.727 --> 01:01:23.886
- Man! You can drive, man!
- What a rush, old man.

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:26.165
Hey, Goldberg, you kidding me?

01:01:28.246 --> 01:01:30.005
Hey, where'd you learn that?

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:32.405
- I was a Girl Scout.
- Really?

01:01:33.846 --> 01:01:36.406
- I'm gonna get you, fucker!
Is that right?

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.085
You don't mess with somebody
in this motherfucking race!

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:39.206
- Is that a fucking date?
- Yeah!

01:01:39.287 --> 01:01:41.526
- Yeah? Come on! Fucking pretty boy!
- Gonna fucking blow up your ass!

01:01:41.647 --> 01:01:43.127
Come on, suck my dick, bitch!

01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:46.007
Hey, Lists, go kick his ass. Come on.

01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:56.646
Tomorrow, you die.

01:02:05.367 --> 01:02:07.287
Katrina! Let's go.

01:02:12.569 --> 01:02:16.848
- Hey, so I get to see you tomorrow, or what?
- If you're lucky.

01:02:28.088 --> 01:02:29.048
Damn.

01:02:30.888 --> 01:02:32.808
Hey, come on, snap out of it, guys.

01:02:33.489 --> 01:02:35.408
Hey, Lists, you gotta fix it up there
under here.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.810
Right here. Right in here.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:48.970
OFFICER 1: Come on, Lucas, let's go.

01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:52.210
OFFICER 2: You heard him. Move.
Hey, what did I do?

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.008
OFFICER 3: Go to sleep!

01:03:05.972 --> 01:03:06.970
Hey, this is bullshit!

01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:14.731
Okay, what did I do?

01:03:15.052 --> 01:03:16.170
You won!

01:03:16.732 --> 01:03:19.771
To the victor belongs the spoils.

01:03:20.691 --> 01:03:21.851
Okay, so what does that mean?

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:26.009
What is this?

01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:31.410
In ancient Rome, the winning gladiator
was the recipient of gifts.

01:03:32.732 --> 01:03:35.252
A show of gratitude from the powers that be

01:03:35.892 --> 01:03:37.811
for a job well done.

01:03:38.333 --> 01:03:39.611
She's yours.

01:03:43.533 --> 01:03:45.052
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:45.772 --> 01:03:47.412
Do with her what you please.

01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.372
Is that right?

01:03:49.773 --> 01:03:50.971
And who the fuck are you?

01:03:53.373 --> 01:03:54.491
I'm Caesar.

01:04:08.253 --> 01:04:10.332
You know, they're probably watching.

01:04:10.974 --> 01:04:12.253
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:13.054 --> 01:04:14.333
Listening, too, I guess.

01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:16.693
Some kind of game they're playing.

01:04:17.694 --> 01:04:20.013
Yeah, probably betting
on what we'll do next.

01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:22.652
Option A, they're trying to get us closer

01:04:24.254 --> 01:04:26.173
so they can use one of us against the other.

01:04:26.254 --> 01:04:27.453
Uh-huh.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:31.734
Option B being, maybe, put a wedge
between us, so we fuck up on the track?

01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:34.814
I guess we do what they want,

01:04:36.255 --> 01:04:38.334
and leave the bullshit for later.

01:04:41.536 --> 01:04:43.055
You playing me?

01:04:45.855 --> 01:04:47.214
Does it matter?

01:04:50.296 --> 01:04:51.294
No.

01:05:56.338 --> 01:05:58.818
Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas,

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:01.177
and all the bangers are going for it.

01:06:06.739 --> 01:06:08.499
Put Mr. Lucas in solitary.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.178
I thought this was a prison thing, but this is
too big for even the guards to resist.

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:14.618
- You still gonna let him race?
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:15.299 --> 01:06:17.698
They're free to kill him on the track,
just not off camera.

01:06:17.819 --> 01:06:18.817
What about him?

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:31.939
Wait! Wait!

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.099
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.420
You had your fun. Move.

01:06:49.701 --> 01:06:51.620
- KATRINA: Where are we going?
- Shut up.

01:06:55.102 --> 01:06:56.821
KATRINA: What the fuck is this?

01:07:05.623 --> 01:07:08.341
Beautiful view of freedom from here, Katrina.

01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:10.140
KATRINA: Okay.

01:07:10.502 --> 01:07:11.741
But who are you?

01:07:15.941 --> 01:07:17.861
You're much more attractive in person.

01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:21.462
I'm flattered. What do you want?

01:07:23.302 --> 01:07:25.703
Carl Lucas. I want him dead.

01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:29.542
And in return, I offer you freedom.

01:07:31.942 --> 01:07:34.023
A chance of life outside these walls

01:07:35.223 --> 01:07:36.983
for one simple task.

01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:41.662
You've got 48 hours.
You kill him or I kill you.

01:07:48.263 --> 01:07:50.462
Let me make these walls disappear.

01:07:52.223 --> 01:07:54.823
Let me make you part of the view
from outside, Katrina.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.943
Freedom.

01:08:00.824 --> 01:08:02.184
Forty-eight hours.

01:08:04.424 --> 01:08:05.543
Tick-tock.

01:08:25.866 --> 01:08:27.944
- Yeah?
Sixty-five share.

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:29.703
Well done, young lady.

01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:39.104
It's truly for the best.

01:08:41.026 --> 01:08:43.145
You weren't happy, the board wasn't happy.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:46.505
We need someone for this institution
that shares the common vision.

01:08:47.145 --> 01:08:48.385
Just wasn't you.

01:08:50.346 --> 01:08:53.225
Warden Parks,
we're here to escort you from the premises.

01:08:57.145 --> 01:08:59.466
"Whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein. "

01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:02.465
Proverb 26:27.

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:05.106
Is that supposed to be deep?

01:09:05.747 --> 01:09:07.425
Hopefully deep enough that, when you fall,

01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:09.426
you'll break your fucking neck.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:31.147
- What do you want?
- Time to race.

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:04.269
You got a big fucking bulls-eye
on your back, Luke.

01:10:04.749 --> 01:10:06.628
You feel all those eyes on you?

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:09.709
Ain't 'cause you're pretty,
or because you're in first place.

01:10:10.349 --> 01:10:13.189
Markus Kane put a million dollars
on your head.

01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.590
It's a monster fucking bounty, Lucas.

01:10:17.031 --> 01:10:18.190
It's as plain as day.

01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:19.950
I don't believe it.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:21.709
Why would I lie?

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.990
It makes no fucking sense.

01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:27.629
What're you gonna do?

01:10:47.472 --> 01:10:50.072
Two, one, and we're in.

01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:52.751
Welcome to Death Race.

01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:57.031
Eighteen men started. Only six remain.

01:10:57.112 --> 01:11:01.231
An estimated 50 million people
watched CarI Lucas win day one.

01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:02.991
Can he do it again?

01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:06.511
Five other racers will have something to say
about that.

01:11:07.112 --> 01:11:09.872
Welcome to day two of Death Race.

01:11:11.793 --> 01:11:14.832
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

01:11:19.992 --> 01:11:23.953
Hey! Aren't you twojust
bubbling over with sunshine this morning?

01:11:24.434 --> 01:11:26.512
Come on. We got a race to win.

01:11:31.634 --> 01:11:32.593
What is it?

01:11:34.992 --> 01:11:35.952
Nothing.

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:38.513
Let's race.

01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:54.193
I've got you now, motherfucker!

01:11:54.355 --> 01:11:55.314
Coming up behind you!

01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:57.234
KATRINA: Watch out!

01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:01.354
Yeah! I just fucked your ass!

01:12:03.674 --> 01:12:04.754
Activate swords and shields.

01:12:09.715 --> 01:12:11.313
Sword plate activated.
- Damn!

01:12:12.275 --> 01:12:14.074
- KATRINA: Watch your back!
- Careful.

01:12:14.676 --> 01:12:15.635
Here comes the guns.

01:12:18.956 --> 01:12:20.035
You gotta find a shield, man.

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:21.115
You gotta find a shield!

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.316
- There's one!
- I see it.

01:12:22.396 --> 01:12:23.635
Go for it. Go for it!

01:12:25.996 --> 01:12:27.755
Shield pressure plate activated.

01:12:30.196 --> 01:12:32.115
- Throw the smoke!
- No, not yet.

01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:34.915
Luke, what're you waiting for?

01:12:34.997 --> 01:12:35.995
Okay, ready?

01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:37.074
Pull it now!

01:12:38.476 --> 01:12:39.476
Smoke, now.

01:13:02.158 --> 01:13:03.156
Let's get this car back in the race.

01:13:09.998 --> 01:13:10.998
Fuck!

01:13:13.919 --> 01:13:15.957
Yeah! Great shit!

01:13:24.598 --> 01:13:26.077
Okay, baby, now we come.

01:13:26.398 --> 01:13:27.798
Sword plate activated.

01:13:28.119 --> 01:13:29.597
Go, go! Get gun! Get gun!

01:13:31.598 --> 01:13:33.518
- Watch your back!
Get your ass out of there, Luke.

01:13:34.399 --> 01:13:36.719
Bounty is mine, motherfucker!

01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:39.799
I'm tired of this asshole.

01:13:40.279 --> 01:13:41.278
Time to lose.

01:13:42.959 --> 01:13:43.959
CALIN: Oh, my God.

01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:45.279
Hang on.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Dig that!

01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:45.321
Still taking it, huh?

01:14:45.403 --> 01:14:47.202
- You die!
- Come on!

01:14:47.323 --> 01:14:49.122
Today! Today you die!

01:14:49.882 --> 01:14:51.322
What do you got, huh?

01:15:04.724 --> 01:15:06.003
Beautiful.

01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:29.963
All right, it's clear sailing
to the finish line now.

01:15:33.005 --> 01:15:34.204
What are you doing?

01:15:38.364 --> 01:15:40.923
- The enemy of my enemy.
- What's happening?

01:15:42.046 --> 01:15:43.084
You die.

01:16:02.525 --> 01:16:05.246
KATRINA: You wanna tell me why
you just risked our lives to save that banger?

01:16:05.565 --> 01:16:08.045
They're Triads. The only people
Markus would not deal with.

01:16:08.686 --> 01:16:11.006
That's why they're not after us.
They have no clue about the hit.

01:16:13.567 --> 01:16:17.085
Look, it's a Triad kill thing.
It's a life for a life.

01:16:17.486 --> 01:16:19.646
I save his, he owes me a favour.

01:16:40.488 --> 01:16:42.247
- Well, I saved your life.
- Really? How so?

01:16:42.608 --> 01:16:46.527
Because your Markus Kane offered
to buy my freedom if I would kill you.

01:16:46.728 --> 01:16:48.926
Jesus! They all want me dead, now you, too?

01:16:52.288 --> 01:16:55.327
- I guess you owe me a favour, too.
- I can't wait.

01:16:56.207 --> 01:16:59.728
- Hey! I want a favour, too, huh?
- Fuck off, Goldberg.

01:17:04.608 --> 01:17:05.648
Yeah, I got you, baby.

01:17:05.968 --> 01:17:07.648
Sword pressure plates activated.

01:17:09.089 --> 01:17:10.129
Shield ahead.

01:17:11.089 --> 01:17:12.849
Shield pressure plate activated.

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:14.048
Okay, ready?

01:17:14.609 --> 01:17:15.648
Activate the napalm on my signal.

01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:19.728
Now.

01:17:22.529 --> 01:17:24.807
- What's this?
- KATRINA: It's not working!

01:17:25.769 --> 01:17:26.768
What's wrong?

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.848
- This is not good, Luke.
- It's a setup.

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:33.090
Yeah. I'm coming, baby!

01:17:36.209 --> 01:17:38.570
Hey, Goldberg.
Someone had a play date with this car.

01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:41.450
I got nothing. No guns, no smoke, nothing.

01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:43.170
Come on, hit it, you dumbass bitch!

01:17:43.329 --> 01:17:44.809
Swerve! Swerve!

01:17:45.129 --> 01:17:46.689
- You, motherfucker!
- Turn!

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:47.969
What can I do?

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:50.209
- Brace yourself.
- No! What are you doing?

01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.169
Get the fuck out ofthere!

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:55.009
Come on! You need to get out of there!

01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:58.090
This is my fight.

01:17:58.852 --> 01:18:00.530
No choice. Hang on.

01:18:08.692 --> 01:18:09.731
Here I come!

01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:13.171
Motherfucker won't stop firing!

01:18:16.012 --> 01:18:17.769
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Heat-seeking missile
has been activated.

01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:27.412
- Come on!
- Hey! Get out of there!

01:18:36.214 --> 01:18:37.292
Come on.

01:18:56.214 --> 01:18:57.733
- Yeah! Shit!
- Yeah!

01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:06.693
- What the fuck?
- You just killed your own pit crew.

01:19:07.255 --> 01:19:09.133
Bitch, you shut the fuck up.

01:19:28.895 --> 01:19:31.055
- Goldberg.
- Hey, get out of there!

01:19:35.975 --> 01:19:37.654
Get in that car! I want a close-up.

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:39.455
Get me out of here!

01:19:40.135 --> 01:19:41.215
Oh, God!

01:19:55.337 --> 01:19:56.336
No!

01:19:59.457 --> 01:20:00.856
Oh, my God, no!

01:20:07.256 --> 01:20:09.935
Somebody help!

01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:17.415
LISTS: Goldberg, get him out! Get him out!

01:20:32.378 --> 01:20:33.537
No.

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.618
Rest in peace, Luke.

01:21:10.779 --> 01:21:11.739
Rocco!

01:21:13.499 --> 01:21:16.378
- You gotta answer for Luke.
- What the fuck you talking about?

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.379
Katrina said it was rigged from the inside.

01:21:19.461 --> 01:21:21.900
And you're the only motherfucker
that could have got to it.

01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:23.418
You killed him?

01:21:25.901 --> 01:21:27.779
Get away from me. Fuck you both.

01:21:34.821 --> 01:21:35.819
- I need to talk to him.
- No.

01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:37.179
He saved your life!

01:21:42.221 --> 01:21:43.220
You owe him.

01:21:44.141 --> 01:21:45.740
A life for a life.

01:21:47.341 --> 01:21:48.661
I know what to do.

01:21:57.941 --> 01:22:01.460
We've induced coma.
Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised,

01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:05.501
but he should be moved to a facility
more suited to his needs.

01:22:06.382 --> 01:22:07.620
Out ofthe question.

01:22:08.422 --> 01:22:11.302
Doctor, someone from the outside
tried to kill him.

01:22:11.983 --> 01:22:15.181
Unless they think he's dead,
they'll come back to finish the job.

01:22:16.023 --> 01:22:18.902
Yeah, well, I can't pronounce a man dead
while he's still alive.

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:21.021
Can't you?

01:22:30.503 --> 01:22:32.781
How are we doing
with finding a replacement for Parks?

01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:34.702
She comes highly recommended
from Halliburton.

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:37.582
She ran their maximum security
detention centre.

01:22:37.743 --> 01:22:40.303
She's strong. She's smart.
Ruthlessly ambitious.

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:43.103
I think if I weren't around, she'd tell people
that Death Race was her idea

01:22:43.183 --> 01:22:44.943
and she'd convince them that it was.

01:22:45.224 --> 01:22:46.863
How's the switchover to the Internet?

01:22:46.943 --> 01:22:48.143
Transition's complete.

01:22:48.704 --> 01:22:50.663
We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow.

01:22:51.905 --> 01:22:53.343
The numbers have
already surpassed pay-per-view,

01:22:53.424 --> 01:22:54.784
thanks to the Frankenstein commercial.

01:22:54.865 --> 01:22:55.983
Hold on. Wait.

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:59.343
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this Frankenstein.

01:23:05.024 --> 01:23:06.704
Did you make him up?

01:23:08.465 --> 01:23:10.223
Frankenstein most certainly exists,

01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:12.144
and he will be in the race tomorrow.

01:23:14.026 --> 01:23:15.025
He better be.

01:23:16.305 --> 01:23:19.984
And he better come as good as advertised.

01:23:30.385 --> 01:23:32.943
The procedure's
experimental and dangerous.

01:23:33.025 --> 01:23:35.345
We're talking about placing
electrodes into the brain.

01:23:35.506 --> 01:23:36.945
You told me
he was a perfect candidate.

01:23:37.027 --> 01:23:38.066
Oh, he is.

01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:39.625
But there are no guarantees.

01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:41.904
Let's wake him up.

01:23:54.227 --> 01:23:55.667
Mr. Lucas.

01:23:56.306 --> 01:24:00.306
You've got second-degree burns
over 85% of your body.

01:24:01.547 --> 01:24:05.387
Now, you're lucky that you suffered
no significant injuries.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:07.785
Not a broken bone or damaged organ,

01:24:08.307 --> 01:24:12.307
which is remarkable
considering the intensity of the fire.

01:24:18.508 --> 01:24:20.068
So, this is hell?

01:24:22.868 --> 01:24:23.947
Why?

01:24:26.069 --> 01:24:27.987
Where else would you be?

01:24:29.108 --> 01:24:30.746
You do rememberme.

01:24:32.748 --> 01:24:34.428
You win five races and you're free.

01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:37.428
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:24:38.589 --> 01:24:40.789
No more Markus Kane
trying to track you down.

01:24:41.909 --> 01:24:43.028
Like a second chance.

01:24:44.789 --> 01:24:46.068
Look at me.

01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:48.309
Really. Look at me.

01:24:54.549 --> 01:24:56.748
What kind of second chance would I have?

01:24:58.429 --> 01:25:00.827
You're either
Frankenstein or you're nobody.

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.708
You're certainly not Carl Lucas any more.

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:06.588
The entire world watched him incinerate.

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.550
There's even a death certificate.

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.669
I pityyou.

01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.549
Okay.
If you don't do it for your life,

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:16.950
then you do it for Katrina.

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:21.870
I'll furlough five of my worst sodomites
for a play date with sweet Katrina.

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:26.270
By the time they're finished with her,
she'll be lucky if she has a pulse.

01:26:21.513 --> 01:26:23.232
How do you feel, Mr. Lucas?

01:26:26.233 --> 01:26:27.192
The name

01:26:28.474 --> 01:26:29.753
is Frankenstein.

01:27:09.115 --> 01:27:10.394
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:27:11.076 --> 01:27:13.115
You're gonna have to settle
for the Mexican Jew.

01:27:14.476 --> 01:27:17.955
Three, two, one, and we're in.

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.915
Good evening, and welcome to Death Race.

01:27:22.316 --> 01:27:26.315
We're streaming live worldwide
for over 20 million viewers. This week...

01:27:26.396 --> 01:27:27.396
Yada, yada, yada.

01:27:27.516 --> 01:27:29.315
Cut in promos of the drivers
as soon as the light hits green,

01:27:29.436 --> 01:27:32.075
cut back to me, crane up,
chase out after Frankenstein. Got it?

01:27:32.155 --> 01:27:33.276
Yeah. It'll look good.

01:27:33.356 --> 01:27:34.795
Yeah, I know it's a great shot.

01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:36.636
It will be. We're live in five.

01:27:36.717 --> 01:27:38.076
Okay, time for one more.

01:27:38.556 --> 01:27:39.515
Go.

01:27:39.717 --> 01:27:40.716
Go!

01:27:44.837 --> 01:27:45.996
Where's Lists?

01:27:46.717 --> 01:27:48.517
Said he had some business to take care of.

01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:29.597
Climb aboard.

01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:00.120
What?

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.321
You expecting another pretty boy?

01:29:37.283 --> 01:29:39.362
Good evening,
and welcome to Death Race.

01:29:39.643 --> 01:29:42.841
We're streaming live
to over 20 million viewers.

01:29:42.922 --> 01:29:45.561
This week, 14K attempts
to repeat as champion.

01:29:46.162 --> 01:29:48.601
But he'll have fierce competition
from several new drivers,

01:29:49.322 --> 01:29:51.402
including Frankenstein.

01:30:41.524 --> 01:30:42.524
What are you doing?

01:30:55.886 --> 01:30:57.205
Tell me who sent you.

01:31:08.406 --> 01:31:09.886
Good for you, Luke.

01:31:17.367 --> 01:31:18.845
Payback for Lucas.

01:31:29.768 --> 01:31:30.847
KATRINA: Oh, my God!

01:32:03.209 --> 01:32:05.288
Yes! The drinks are on me!

01:32:05.768 --> 01:32:06.888
Yes!

01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:11.687
Move my tee-off time
from 9:00 to 10:00.

01:32:12.888 --> 01:32:14.248
You see that?

01:32:15.690 --> 01:32:17.128
That's a stupid bitch.

01:32:23.130 --> 01:32:24.649
Take care of your business?

01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.689
I'm only sorry Luke didn't live to see this.

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:42.410
I'm not so sure he didn't.

01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.250
Frankenstein, huh?

01:32:50.252 --> 01:32:51.490
You got a real name?

01:32:55.931 --> 01:32:57.450
Uh-huh.

01:32:58.092 --> 01:32:59.451
Yeah, of course, I do.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:14.570
Live from Terminal Island,
television's most violent, most disturbing,

01:33:14.651 --> 01:33:16.971
and most watched programme
in human history.

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:19.772
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

01:33:19.852 --> 01:33:21.531
