WEBVTT

00:10.677 --> 00:13.108
Well, you're awfully happy.

00:13.175 --> 00:14.474
We're having a cocktail party.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.239
What's not to be happy about?

00:16.306 --> 00:18.105
Red, the last time we had a party,

00:18.173 --> 00:22.240
you called the cops and had
them tow everyone's car.

00:22.308 --> 00:24.281
Drunk people looking
for their cars.

00:24.349 --> 00:25.618
That was funny.

00:25.686 --> 00:27.220
Oh, you're just giddy

00:27.288 --> 00:30.088
because Bob's bringing his
pretty new girlfriend over.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.087
Oh, Kitty, don't be ridiculous.

00:32.155 --> 00:34.786
I'm just happy. Now why do you
want to ruin my happiness?

00:34.854 --> 00:37.787
Because that's what a wife does.

00:37.855 --> 00:39.257
You know, my dad dating your mom

00:39.258 --> 00:41.328
goes against all
the laws of nature.

00:41.329 --> 00:45.666
I mean, you don't see a
giraffe with a panda bear.

00:45.734 --> 00:48.539
You know, my dad being the
cute, fuzzy panda bear,

00:48.607 --> 00:50.540
and your mom being the evil,

00:50.608 --> 00:53.241
money-hungry unnaturally
tan giraffe.

00:53.309 --> 00:55.311
Well, I've had it with them, too.

00:55.312 --> 00:57.715
Last night your dad
burped in front of my mom,

00:57.716 --> 00:59.183
and she laughed, Donna.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.184
Laughed!

01:02.552 --> 01:04.321
Okay, we're Burkharts.

01:04.388 --> 01:07.659
We don't burp, and we don't
tolerate people who do.

01:07.727 --> 01:10.997
Hey, everybody, I brought a date.

01:11.999 --> 01:13.700
Look how tall she is.

01:13.768 --> 01:16.071
It's like I'm dating
the statue of liberty.

01:17.373 --> 01:20.308
Oh, Kitty, I just love
coming over to your house.

01:20.376 --> 01:22.110
You have such unique tastes.

01:22.178 --> 01:26.115
It's like being at a
giant flea market.

01:26.182 --> 01:28.250
And like at every flea market,

01:28.318 --> 01:30.620
Bob's gonna leave with
the tackiest thing here.

01:32.489 --> 01:34.657
Pam, come on in.

01:34.725 --> 01:37.661
I made your favorite drink...
Tequila sunrise.

01:37.729 --> 01:40.563
Red, always the gentleman.

01:40.631 --> 01:43.499
Yeah, well...

01:43.567 --> 01:45.200
Red, Red, honey,

01:45.268 --> 01:47.035
where's my favorite drink?

01:47.102 --> 01:49.670
I didn't know you had a
favorite drink, Kitty,

01:49.738 --> 01:52.239
seeing as how much
you like all drinks.

01:52.306 --> 01:55.074
I'll take a drink, Red.

01:55.142 --> 01:58.243
Beer's in the garage, Bob.

01:58.311 --> 02:01.146
Mrs. Burkhart?

02:01.214 --> 02:03.148
That's weird.

02:03.216 --> 02:06.452
Golly, I didn't know
you were dropping by.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.755
Yeah, you did.

02:08.822 --> 02:10.823
I told you she was,

02:10.890 --> 02:13.826
and you said, "oh, boy,
I'm gonna wear my suit."

02:13.894 --> 02:14.561
Well, I'm sorry, Donna.

02:14.562 --> 02:16.964
Is there some kind of law
against being handsome?

02:17.032 --> 02:18.766
Because if there is,

02:18.833 --> 02:22.736
then guilty as charged.

02:22.804 --> 02:26.739
Mrs. Burkhart, when
did you get here?

02:26.807 --> 02:29.108
Is it too much for you people

02:29.176 --> 02:31.177
to let me know that
we have company?

02:32.245 --> 02:33.479
One bronzed-up tart in the room,

02:33.547 --> 02:35.481
and all the men turn into a bunch

02:35.549 --> 02:37.650
of oversexed fraternity boys.

02:37.717 --> 02:39.518
Kitty, you're just
imagining things.

02:39.586 --> 02:42.854
What's she wearing?

02:42.922 --> 02:45.523

03:23.309 --> 03:25.544
Oh, I cannot believe you kids,

03:25.611 --> 03:29.114
trying to sneak off
with my good gin.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.149
Yeah, I shoulda known.

03:31.217 --> 03:33.452
She can smell booze
from a mile away.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.521
Excuse me?

03:36.589 --> 03:40.291
Oh, I said, "you smell like
booze from a mile away."

03:42.194 --> 03:44.228
That's worse, dumb-ass!

03:46.198 --> 03:47.698
Oh, what a lovely evening.

03:47.699 --> 03:50.134
if I didn't know any better,

03:50.201 --> 03:52.537
I'd swear I was with rich people.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.973
She's got it all...

03:55.041 --> 03:57.576
Looks and beauty.

03:57.644 --> 03:59.578
Pam, you want another drink?

03:59.646 --> 04:01.347
Honey, you shouldn't be drinking.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.917
You have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow.

04:03.985 --> 04:07.754
He has a heart condition.
He's very old.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.494
I never thought I'd say
this, but I wish I was Bob.

04:13.562 --> 04:14.630
I wonder if she'd like

04:14.631 --> 04:16.666
to watch "the graduate"
with me some night.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.969
One time back when I
was dating Jackie,

04:19.036 --> 04:21.704
Pam was trying to
wash her car, right,

04:21.773 --> 04:24.542
and she leaned over and, like,
squeezed out the sponge.

04:24.609 --> 04:26.377
That's all I remember,

04:26.444 --> 04:28.979
cause I rode my bike
straight into a tree.

04:31.049 --> 04:33.317
Oh, look at her.

04:33.384 --> 04:35.986
Would you ever want me
to show that much leg?

04:36.054 --> 04:38.221
Absolutely not.

04:38.289 --> 04:40.958
And why not?

04:41.026 --> 04:44.162
You set me up.

04:45.964 --> 04:48.867
Jackie, I can't see
your mom's hand,

04:48.935 --> 04:51.603
which means it's on my dad's butt.

04:51.671 --> 04:53.606
We have to break 'em up.

04:53.674 --> 04:55.942
I've been bad-mouthing
Pinciottis for years.

04:56.010 --> 04:57.644
I can be one.

04:57.712 --> 04:59.714
So that's when I realized

04:59.781 --> 05:03.351
that "tapas" sounds a
lot like "topless."

05:03.419 --> 05:07.756
But I had already promised, so...

05:07.824 --> 05:09.458
Hey, mrs. Burkhart,

05:09.525 --> 05:12.194
why don't I throw on some
music for us to, uh...

05:12.262 --> 05:13.695
Shake our booties to?

05:13.763 --> 05:15.964
Hey, stop acting like an ass

05:15.965 --> 05:19.068
in front of the pretty lady.

05:19.135 --> 05:21.804
That's ok, Red. I think he's cute.

05:21.871 --> 05:25.073
Yeah, well, he is
my son, you know.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.780
Well, good party, good party.

05:31.847 --> 05:33.782
When Pam and I were dancing,

05:33.849 --> 05:38.586
she, uh, "accidentally"
brushed my butt.

05:38.654 --> 05:41.021
And tell 'em what
happened after that.

05:41.089 --> 05:42.890
Well, then I said,

05:42.958 --> 05:45.726
"hey, you can squeeze
my butt anytime."

05:45.793 --> 05:48.895
And then it got really quiet.

05:48.962 --> 05:51.431
And then she walked over to Bob,

05:51.499 --> 05:55.203
and they were talking
and pointing at me.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.905
Then you tried to laugh it off,

05:57.973 --> 06:00.575
and you spit dip up on your shirt.

06:02.245 --> 06:04.246
Then you tried to do that joke

06:04.313 --> 06:06.381
where you scoop the dip off
your shirt with a chip,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.651
and none laughed, and here we are.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.921
You know, there's a
lot of talk about Pam,

06:11.989 --> 06:15.292
but, Eric, I still have
feelings for your mom.

06:15.359 --> 06:18.996
I mean, she comes off all
pure, but she's dirty.

06:19.064 --> 06:22.500
Why can't my dad just see that
Pam is a total gold digger?

06:22.567 --> 06:25.270
Oh, would you stop saying that?

06:25.338 --> 06:28.740
Hey, either she digs for
gold or she doesn't.

06:28.808 --> 06:30.608
It's easy to check.

06:30.676 --> 06:32.977
Are her boots muddy?

06:33.045 --> 06:35.513
Does she carry a pickax?

06:35.581 --> 06:37.848
When she comes home does she say,

06:37.916 --> 06:41.318
"tough day at the gold mine"?

06:41.386 --> 06:43.854
No, Fez, a gold digger
is what these idiots

06:43.922 --> 06:46.457
call a woman who knows that
love eventually wears off,

06:46.525 --> 06:48.526
but money is forever.

06:50.162 --> 06:52.196
You guys, all I know is

06:52.264 --> 06:54.799
pretty tan lady touched my butt.

06:54.866 --> 06:57.802
And that is more action
than I've gotten in weeks.

06:57.869 --> 06:59.503
Keep it up,

06:59.571 --> 07:02.240
and you'll be having
sex with yourself.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.243
I mean, how does Bob

07:05.310 --> 07:07.545
pull all these foxes
like Midge and Pam?

07:07.613 --> 07:10.548
He's got to have something
the ladies can't resist.

07:10.616 --> 07:13.385
Hey, Donna, you ever
see your dad naked?

07:13.452 --> 07:15.353
My God!

07:15.421 --> 07:18.256
Can we please talk about
anything besides that?

07:18.324 --> 07:20.091
You're way off, Hyde.

07:20.159 --> 07:22.460
Women love Bob for
his sense of humor.

07:22.528 --> 07:25.530
That sucker's funnier
than a dixie cup.

07:25.598 --> 07:27.032
No. All right,

07:27.099 --> 07:29.834
how it works is relationships
are based on a point system.

07:29.902 --> 07:32.537
All right, see, Pam
is good looking.

07:32.605 --> 07:34.506
So that's 20 points.

07:34.574 --> 07:37.008
And Bob, he's, like, the
nicest guy in the world,

07:37.076 --> 07:39.144
so that's, like, what, a point?

07:41.080 --> 07:44.950
But Bob's got money,
and that's 19 points.

07:45.018 --> 07:46.685
And altogether, that's 20.

07:46.753 --> 07:49.188
Now you add the whole thing
together, and that's 40,

07:49.255 --> 07:52.023
Which is incidentally
almost half my score.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.628
?

07:58.464 --> 08:00.565
I don't care what
that doctor says.

08:00.633 --> 08:03.568
I'm not wearing this
stupid heart monitor.

08:05.071 --> 08:07.939
It makes me look
like a damn robot.

08:08.007 --> 08:11.176
Red, I'm sure you won't
even know it's there.

08:11.244 --> 08:13.678
It'll only beep if your heart
rate goes above normal,

08:13.746 --> 08:16.080
like when you get
agitated or excited

08:16.148 --> 08:19.684
or extra angry or extra happy.

08:19.752 --> 08:23.121
I'm putting my money
on extra angry.

08:23.188 --> 08:26.958
I bet the damn thing
doesn't even work.

08:27.026 --> 08:28.493
You know what, Red?
Your attitude stinks.

08:28.561 --> 08:29.828
You wouldn't be in this mess

08:29.895 --> 08:31.863
if you'd just listened
to me in the first place.

08:31.931 --> 08:32.998
Kitty...

08:33.065 --> 08:35.099
I told you to eat more
fiber in the mornings.

08:35.167 --> 08:37.168
I told you to exercise,

08:37.236 --> 08:39.703
to wear more comfortable
shoes for circulation.

08:39.772 --> 08:41.205
Did you listen? No.

08:41.273 --> 08:43.707
So I guess I'm just
gonna keep telling you

08:43.775 --> 08:45.009
and telling you and telling you.

08:49.381 --> 08:52.649
What do you know? It does work.

08:54.652 --> 08:57.287
?

08:57.354 --> 09:01.123
Hey, I can't believe you
guys aren't in Bob's hot tub.

09:01.191 --> 09:03.358
You know, I feel
like Warren Beatty

09:03.426 --> 09:05.894
in a movie about a hot tub.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.931
He's, like, hot
tubbin', then, like...

09:09.999 --> 09:12.367
Other stuff happens.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.436
Kelso, just so you know,

09:14.504 --> 09:16.605
Bob was in there an hour ago,

09:16.673 --> 09:19.441
so you are, like, covered
in hot, bubbly Bob.

09:21.511 --> 09:23.612
Dad, will you please listen to us?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.114
We talked about it,

09:25.181 --> 09:28.083
and we really think you
need to break up with Pam.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.585
No way. Open your eyes!

09:29.653 --> 09:31.554
Everyone can see what
a big mistake this is.

09:31.622 --> 09:35.124
Oh, so everyone here thinks I
should just break up with Pam?

09:35.192 --> 09:36.992
I say stick with her, Bob.

09:37.060 --> 09:39.695
My only advice is take pictures,

09:39.763 --> 09:42.231
otherwise no one's
gonna believe you.

09:42.299 --> 09:44.400
Don't listen to him.

09:44.468 --> 09:47.203
He grew up poor. He's stupid.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.338
What do you think, Eric?

09:49.406 --> 09:53.475
Yeah, Eric, what do you think?

09:53.543 --> 09:56.211
I hope it's the right answer.

09:58.047 --> 10:00.682
You love that woman for
all she's worth, Bob!

10:00.750 --> 10:02.517
Eric!

10:02.585 --> 10:05.353
What are you gonna do, cut
me off from sex again?

10:05.421 --> 10:08.489
I agree with Forman, Bob.
I think you should keep her.

10:08.557 --> 10:09.991
I mean, you're you,

10:10.059 --> 10:13.494
and you're getting
me-quality girls.

10:13.562 --> 10:17.065
You're living life
Kelso-style. Enjoy.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.133
Oh, I am so sorry I'm late.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.203
I locked my keys in the car,

10:21.270 --> 10:23.305
and I had to use a coat
hanger to jimmy the lock.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.307
I had to reach down in there,

10:25.374 --> 10:27.375
and I had to shimmy
and shimmy and shimmy

10:27.443 --> 10:29.411
until the darn thing
finally popped open.

10:29.479 --> 10:32.380
Boy, I'm sorry I missed that.

10:32.448 --> 10:35.284
Yeah, could act it out
for us one more time?

10:37.254 --> 10:39.722
Look, mom, Donna and I decided

10:39.789 --> 10:41.924
that you two can't see
each other anymore.

10:41.992 --> 10:44.860
We're your children,
and we love you,

10:44.927 --> 10:46.728
but your happiness

10:46.796 --> 10:48.764
is much less important than ours.

10:48.831 --> 10:51.767
Jackie, when your dad
went away to jail,

10:51.835 --> 10:54.570
I decided to do
some work on myself.

10:54.638 --> 10:56.706
Not on the outside, obviously,

10:56.774 --> 10:58.608
because, well, come on.

10:58.676 --> 11:00.843
But on the inside,

11:00.911 --> 11:03.947
you know, the part that
doesn't matter as much.

11:04.015 --> 11:06.115
And I've realized
that I need a man

11:06.183 --> 11:08.484
who makes me feel
good about myself.

11:08.552 --> 11:11.487
I need you Bob.

11:11.555 --> 11:14.123
Aww, you know, if an
ugly woman said that,

11:14.191 --> 11:16.693
it just wouldn't mean as much.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.264
Man, if this was a movie,

11:21.332 --> 11:23.833
Pam would pick up Bob
and just carry him off

11:23.901 --> 11:25.468
to a better life.

11:25.536 --> 11:27.470
If this were a good movie,

11:27.538 --> 11:30.240
Pam would have entered
the scene topless.

11:30.308 --> 11:32.475
Yeah, if this were a great movie,

11:32.543 --> 11:35.545
they'd have a monkey friend
that did all this crazy stuff.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.614
You know what?
You guys were no help.

11:37.615 --> 11:39.449
You could have backed us up.

11:39.517 --> 11:41.718
And you could be sleeping with me.

11:41.786 --> 11:44.187
People could be doing
a lot of things.

11:44.255 --> 11:46.856
All right, I'm done peeing.

11:46.924 --> 11:49.258
Hey, can you hand me my clothes?

11:49.326 --> 11:52.329
Kelso, are you naked?

11:52.396 --> 11:54.865
No.

11:54.932 --> 11:57.468
Eric, could you hand
me my clothes, please?

11:57.536 --> 11:58.602
I'm sorry, buddy.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.604
I can't hear you over the hot tub.

12:00.671 --> 12:02.439
Did you hear him, Hyde?

12:02.506 --> 12:03.873
I think so.

12:03.941 --> 12:05.508
I think he said to take
his clothes and run away.

12:05.509 --> 12:06.776
Oooh.

12:06.843 --> 12:10.646
Guys, guys, come back!

12:10.714 --> 12:15.151
Well, looks like I'm
gonna have to be nude

12:15.218 --> 12:17.820
in front of you guys, and
that's kind of awkward.

12:17.887 --> 12:21.122
So I think you ladies
should nude up.

12:21.790 --> 12:25.793
?

12:25.860 --> 12:28.896
Okay, good news, Red.

12:28.963 --> 12:31.631
I made your favorite lunch...

12:31.699 --> 12:34.067
Lasagna!

12:34.135 --> 12:35.969
Thanks.

12:36.037 --> 12:37.938
"thanks"?

12:38.005 --> 12:41.241
Aren't you excited?
Let's hear that monitor!

12:41.308 --> 12:45.178
So every time you do
something nice for me,

12:45.246 --> 12:48.081
I'm supposed to
have a heart attack?

12:48.148 --> 12:51.484
Well, no, not an attack.
Just a little episode.

12:51.552 --> 12:53.787
Ha ha ha ha!

12:53.855 --> 12:57.291
I mean, what does it take
to get that beeper going?

12:57.359 --> 12:58.826
Hi, Red.

13:04.968 --> 13:09.571
Wow, that must be the
lasagna kicking in.

13:20.017 --> 13:22.220
Hey, what do you say

13:22.487 --> 13:23.988
we have some more of that lasagna?

13:24.056 --> 13:26.857
Boy, was that delicious.

13:26.925 --> 13:29.660
Beep! Beep! Beep!

13:29.728 --> 13:31.328
Oh, can it, Red.

13:31.396 --> 13:33.597
When Pam showed up, your
heart monitor went off

13:33.664 --> 13:35.332
like a freakin' slot machine.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.167
Pam had nothing to do
with that thing going off,

13:37.235 --> 13:38.368
Damn it!

13:38.436 --> 13:40.803
Oh, and look at us now.
We're arguing.

13:40.871 --> 13:42.205
Can't even get a beep out of you.

13:42.273 --> 13:45.274
Your son is a jerk.

13:51.014 --> 13:53.616
Come on, I am gonna prove to you

13:53.684 --> 13:55.552
that I am not attracted to Pam.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.087
Hey, guys.

14:01.326 --> 14:04.429
I think I'm having
a war flashback.

14:04.496 --> 14:06.597
I'm messed up, Kitty.

14:06.665 --> 14:09.501
I'm real messed up.

14:11.570 --> 14:14.139
I cannot believe you told
my dad to stay with Pam.

14:14.206 --> 14:16.074
She doesn't even like you.

14:16.142 --> 14:17.876
She told my dad you
groped her at the party.

14:17.943 --> 14:20.044
Okay, look, Donna, you and Pam

14:20.812 --> 14:22.512
obviously have some
serious issues.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.314
I think you two
should work them out

14:24.382 --> 14:26.917
with a good old-fashioned
pillow fight.

14:26.985 --> 14:30.019
Come on, Jackie, I
think maybe you should

14:30.087 --> 14:32.923
throw on a nightgown
and defend your mom.

14:32.991 --> 14:34.725
You're sick.

14:34.793 --> 14:37.195
And, you, you were no help either.

14:37.262 --> 14:39.397
Hey, I was just
agreeing with Forman,

14:39.465 --> 14:41.400
so he didn't look so bad.

14:41.468 --> 14:45.137
You said it before he did.

14:45.205 --> 14:48.107
Oh, yeah

14:48.175 --> 14:50.176
What's the big deal?

14:50.243 --> 14:52.512
Bob and Pam are
adults who want to do

14:52.579 --> 14:54.914
what comes naturally
to everybody except me.

14:54.982 --> 14:57.216
So I say,

14:57.284 --> 14:59.685
why can't I get any?

14:59.753 --> 15:02.922
You know, Pam wants
to be with my dad now,

15:02.990 --> 15:04.323
but what happens when
someone else comes along?

15:05.791 --> 15:08.460
I wouldn't care so much
if I could just, you know,

15:08.528 --> 15:10.028
test her with a hotter guy

15:10.096 --> 15:11.629
and see if she falls for him.

15:11.697 --> 15:15.600
Because I love you,

15:15.668 --> 15:18.169
I'll do it.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.805
Why would you do it?
This is a man's job.

15:20.873 --> 15:22.807
Don't wait up for me, baby.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.042
Ohh!

15:24.110 --> 15:26.311
No, it has to be someone her type.

15:26.379 --> 15:28.647
Well, I know from
her time in Mexico

15:28.714 --> 15:31.883
that she has a weakness for
young, dark-skinned guys.

15:36.189 --> 15:38.858
I guess I can ask around.

15:44.126 --> 15:47.963
Mmm, that smells delicious.

15:47.964 --> 15:48.631
What is it?

15:48.632 --> 15:49.765
It's not for you.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.768
You can go look for scraps
around the neighborhood

15:52.835 --> 15:55.103
like the rest of the dogs.

15:55.171 --> 15:58.239
Kitty, for the last time,

15:58.307 --> 16:01.142
I am not attracted to Pam.

16:01.209 --> 16:03.110
Please, believe me,

16:03.178 --> 16:05.545
as the husband who has shared

16:05.613 --> 16:09.216
your laughter and tears for...

16:09.284 --> 16:11.985
Many happy years.

16:12.053 --> 16:14.288
How many years, Red?

16:14.356 --> 16:16.691
All of 'em.

16:18.759 --> 16:20.994
You can't give me
a number, can you?

16:21.062 --> 16:24.264
Well, I can tell you on
a scale of one to ten,

16:24.332 --> 16:25.499
I love you ten.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.537
That's a number.

16:29.605 --> 16:32.240
Oh, why don't you just
take your cardiac jukebox

16:32.308 --> 16:34.209
over to Pam's?

16:34.276 --> 16:35.710
Hi, Kitty. Hi, Red.

16:35.778 --> 16:38.213
I thought we'd come
over and see if you two

16:38.280 --> 16:39.714
wanted to catch a movie.

16:44.654 --> 16:46.687
Why are you staring?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.423
Too pretty for Wisconsin?

16:50.992 --> 16:53.560
I get that a lot.

16:53.628 --> 16:55.696
You shut it off, didn't you?

16:55.764 --> 16:58.032
No, I did not shut it off!

16:58.100 --> 16:59.233
Let's hustle it up.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.035
I don't want to sit
behind people with hats.

17:04.707 --> 17:07.009
Ha!

17:07.077 --> 17:09.311
Look at that, nosey!

17:09.378 --> 17:11.181
It's not Pam.

17:11.248 --> 17:13.717
It's Bob, because he annoys me.

17:13.784 --> 17:17.819
That's true. I do.

17:17.887 --> 17:19.289
What are you guys talking about?

17:21.425 --> 17:22.392
Um...

17:22.460 --> 17:25.895
Ha ha ha ha!

17:28.597 --> 17:31.032
I, um, I sort of thought

17:31.099 --> 17:33.501
that Red had a crush on you.

17:33.568 --> 17:35.670
Oh, Kitty, I'm sorry.

17:35.737 --> 17:38.105
This face can bring
as much trouble

17:38.173 --> 17:39.941
as it does joy.

17:40.009 --> 17:43.945
Well, Kitty, what do you
have to say for yourself?

17:46.049 --> 17:48.384
It's the menopause.

17:49.586 --> 17:52.888
I'm messed up, Red.
I'm real messed up.

17:55.426 --> 17:58.595
?

18:05.770 --> 18:07.637
Um, hello.

18:12.476 --> 18:13.977
What are you doing?

18:14.044 --> 18:16.912
I was hired to clean the hot tub.

18:18.115 --> 18:20.983
But you should know that I, uh...

18:21.051 --> 18:25.021
Perform other services, too.

18:25.088 --> 18:28.791
Well, you could start
by doing a better job.

18:28.859 --> 18:31.361
It's still dirty.

18:31.428 --> 18:35.031
So you like it dirty?

18:35.099 --> 18:38.735
No, I want it clean.

18:38.802 --> 18:41.838
So you like it filthy?

18:41.905 --> 18:43.072
Bob!

18:43.140 --> 18:45.775
Whoa, I'm not into that!

18:45.843 --> 18:48.544
No.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.883
Hey, Eric, that was a good
burn stealing my clothes.

18:53.950 --> 18:56.886
But the laugh's on you,
'cause I borrowed your pants,

18:56.954 --> 18:59.655
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

19:05.029 --> 19:06.796
Kelso, just so you know,

19:06.864 --> 19:08.164
the last time I wore those pants,

19:08.232 --> 19:10.733
I wasn't wearing any underwear.

19:12.603 --> 19:14.603
Ouch. Well-played.

19:14.671 --> 19:17.573
Where the hell is Fez?

19:17.641 --> 19:19.976
He should have been back by now.

19:20.044 --> 19:22.379
Oh, I swear, if he touched
my mother inappropriately,

19:22.446 --> 19:24.681
he is never borrowing
my curling iron again.

19:24.749 --> 19:26.617
Man, first I wanted to be Bob.

19:26.684 --> 19:27.952
Now I wish I was Fez.

19:28.019 --> 19:29.888
What the hell is
going on this week?

19:29.955 --> 19:32.791
Ahem.

19:32.858 --> 19:35.894
Did you tell Fez to
make a move on Pam?

19:35.962 --> 19:37.629
'cause if you didn't,
I'm gonna box him up

19:37.697 --> 19:40.465
and send him back to banana town.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.069
Okay, I'm sick of those comments.

19:44.137 --> 19:47.239
I don't say I'm gonna send
you back to polyester town.

19:50.575 --> 19:53.243
Dad, I'm really sorry.

19:53.311 --> 19:55.012
It was just the only
thing we could think of

19:55.080 --> 19:57.581
to prove that Pam
doesn't, you know,

19:57.649 --> 19:59.083
really care about you.

19:59.151 --> 20:00.418
Well, guess what.

20:00.485 --> 20:01.552
She does really care about me,

20:01.620 --> 20:03.521
so you can stop playing
these little games,

20:03.588 --> 20:05.756
because Pam makes me happier

20:05.824 --> 20:07.425
than I have been in a long time.

20:07.493 --> 20:10.528
You better accept it soon,
'cause she's here to stay.

20:10.596 --> 20:14.298
That's right.
I will have my pretty lady.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.070
This Bob is back.

20:27.245 --> 20:29.713
Way to go, Bob!

20:29.781 --> 20:31.849
I love you, man!

20:33.352 --> 20:35.853
Bob, you're just like me.

20:35.921 --> 20:38.056
We give regular guys hope.

20:38.124 --> 20:41.060
You can't leave Pam, because...

20:41.128 --> 20:44.263
Because Pam's your Donna.

20:45.599 --> 20:49.169
Steven, am I your Donna?

20:49.237 --> 20:52.473
That doesn't apply to us.
We're both good-looking.

20:55.277 --> 20:57.611
Dad, can we at least
talk about this?

20:58.079 --> 20:59.613
I'm sorry, Donna.

20:59.681 --> 21:00.781
That's the way it's gonna be.

21:00.848 --> 21:03.750
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

21:05.986 --> 21:07.687
Should've known this
wasn't gonna work.

21:07.754 --> 21:10.856
Foreigners never finish the job.

21:10.924 --> 21:13.091
Oh, please, if Bob
hadn't shown up,

21:13.159 --> 21:16.327
I'd be your stepdaddy right now.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.883
B-7.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.585
Miss.

21:27.652 --> 21:30.454
Oh, man, how do I
keep missing you?

21:30.522 --> 21:33.324
It's 'cause I don't
have any boats on there.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.728
What's that noise?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.663
It's my dad's heart monitor.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.365
Where's your mom?

21:41.433 --> 21:44.635
She's with him.

21:46.271 --> 21:49.907
Oh, take off the beeper!
Other people live here!
