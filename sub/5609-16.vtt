NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.081
Our secret remains safe.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.332
The Author's pen?

00:06.423 --> 00:08.004
HENRY: I'm going to write the stories
as they are,

00:08.091 --> 00:09.422
and I'll start with Hades.

00:09.635 --> 00:10.750
HADES: (WHISPERS) She's pregnant.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.176
You two had a contract.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.470
Which he just signed over to me.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.588
At any time,

00:17.184 --> 00:20.927
I can cash in and take your baby.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.512
You work for me.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.455
CORA: Poor baby.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.878
Now I must give you away

00:47.965 --> 00:51.332
to give me
(VOICE BREAKING) my best chance.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.127
(BABY CRYING)

00:57.683 --> 00:58.889
(CRYING STOPS)

00:59.518 --> 01:01.554
You gave away the wrong child, Mother.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.810
Soon, you'll see.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.055
Soon.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.819
-(SQUAWK|NG)

No! No! No! No!

01:12.656 --> 01:13.645
(YELLS)

01:14.992 --> 01:16.983
Well, isn't this nice?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.738
(STAMMERS) What do you want?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.035
Why, you, of course.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.415
You're going to help me create
a very special spell.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.205
One that no sorcerer has yet to achieve.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.704
A time travel spell.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.421
| just need the ingredients.

01:28.505 --> 01:32.043
Symbols of innocence, love,
courage and wisdom.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.542
A symbol of innocence
could be a baby, for instance.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.340
And a symbol of wisdom

01:38.098 --> 01:39.804
could be a brain. (CHUCKLES EVILLY)

01:40.350 --> 01:41.339
(GASPS)

01:41.852 --> 01:44.013
-Your brain, to be exact.
-Oh, no.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.351
No! No! No! No!

01:45.606 --> 01:46.595
Stop!

01:47.357 --> 01:48.346
-Dorothy?
-(GASPS)

01:49.693 --> 01:51.024
Didn't I send you back to Kansas?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.351
Well, Witch.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.476
(SCARECROW WHIMPERS)

01:53.697 --> 01:55.187
I'm back.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.443
Those slippers.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.028
They were supposed to be
a one-way ticket home.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.579
You left me no choice. I had to return.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.369
When I got word that you were alive

02:06.418 --> 02:07.533
and had taken over Oz,

02:07.753 --> 02:08.742
I had to stop you.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.457
Wait, you got word?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.789
Munchkins.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.050
-Let the Scarecrow go.
-Yes.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.798
Sorry, I think I'll hold on to him.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.382
You will never defeat me, Zelena.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.889
Because I have
the most powerful weapon of all.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.057
The love of the people.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.220
(WICKED WITCH LAUGHS)

02:29.608 --> 02:31.314
Aw, well, then.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.071
No! (GRUNTS)

02:47.542 --> 02:48.793
(TOTO BARKING)

02:49.419 --> 02:50.408
No!

03:18.782 --> 03:19.771
(GEARS CLICK)

03:27.958 --> 03:31.325
You'd think a desperate man
would work a little faster.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.372
Magic cannot be rushed.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.170
Creating a portal is no simple task.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.288
Yes.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.958
Yes, I know.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.005
Look, we don't have a Dark Curse

03:41.471 --> 03:43.052
or a magic bean

03:43.306 --> 03:44.637
or silver slippers.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.969
We have something better,
your Dark One tainted blood.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.179
It got you down here.
It can reopen the portal.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.304
Why do you even need a portal?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.143
You can come and go as you please.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.566
HADES: But I can't bring
anyone back alive.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.979
By combining our powers,

04:00.824 --> 04:02.815
that can change.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.655
And I don't care
how painful it is for you.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.995
So, if you want me to
tear up this contract

04:13.086 --> 04:15.828
so your child-to-be is your child-to-be,

04:17.174 --> 04:19.665
you won't care about the pain either.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.547
You must tell me
where you want this portal directed.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.961
Oh.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.553
Why, Storybrooke, of course.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.095
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

04:39.404 --> 04:42.066
Hello, little ones. Hi.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.359
Did you sleep well?

04:44.201 --> 04:45.236
Yeah? (GASPS)

04:46.203 --> 04:47.363
(BABY LAUGHS)

04:47.871 --> 04:50.237
Belle. What are you doing here?

04:51.583 --> 04:54.074
Uh, formula for the babies.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.750
(LAUGHS) Of course. Here, I'll help.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.207
Uh, the red one's hers.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.715
Oh. (CHUCKLES) Right. I don't know
where my head is today.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.250
-(CHUCKLES)
-(BABY COOING)

05:03.553 --> 05:06.886
Uh, Mother Superior, what's going on?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.223
Nothing. Everything's fine.

05:10.727 --> 05:11.716
Mmm.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.302
MOTHER SUPERIOR: No, it's not.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.935
Who are you?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.061
Zelena.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.654
(CHUCKLES) You really
are a clever girl.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.815
(GASPS)

05:26.952 --> 05:28.067
No.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.405
Regina sent you back to Oz.
How did you...

05:30.497 --> 05:33.614
All you need to know is that
my sister can't keep me down.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.286
I've come for my baby.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.416
So, if you wish to remain alive,
step aside.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.672
Zelena's baby?

05:47.597 --> 05:49.178
What do you want with her child?

05:49.266 --> 05:52.679
You of all people should know the value
of keeping your reasons your own.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.760
I don't have to tell you anything.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.804
(CHUCKLES)
And yet you keep doing so.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.182
Some might call that
the mark of an insecure man.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.605
We're done here.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.777
Get me Zelena's baby.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.323
I will rip up the contract
and you can tell Belle she's pregnant

06:08.451 --> 06:13.195
without also having to tell her
she owes her baby to me.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.457
I hear new expectant mothers hate that.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.879
Almost as much as they hate hearing

06:19.963 --> 06:22.375
their husbands are still the Dark One.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.129
Now do it.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.593
(BABY CRYING)

06:32.893 --> 06:34.133
Put her down.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.971
Or what? Hmm?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.643
You'll smite me
with your book learning?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.221
Oh, I have something more than that.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.681
Please.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.354
Neither of you would
dare risk hurting my child.

(WHOOSHING)

06:58.960 --> 06:59.995
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

07:00.045 --> 07:02.912
No. You don't want to hurt your baby.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.086
ZELENA: No.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.664
But I don't mind hurting you.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.000
Okay. We'll see.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.343
(RUMBUNG)

07:13.725 --> 07:16.762
Stop it!
Stop it! You're endangering everyone!

07:16.853 --> 07:18.184
It's not me that's doing it!

07:26.196 --> 07:27.561
No!

07:38.249 --> 07:39.910
Okay.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.078
Where's the baby?

(BABY CRYING)

07:50.220 --> 07:53.212

-(ZELENA GROANS)
-How did we get out here?

07:56.434 --> 07:59.050
(PANTING) My baby.
My baby! Is she hurt?

AM(GROANS)

08:05.402 --> 08:06.892
No! My magic!

08:08.113 --> 08:09.649
Zelena, what did you do to us?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.570
I didn't do anything. This wasn't me.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.993
Okay, then if it wasn't you,
then who was it?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.284
And where are we?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.779
And why is the sky red?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.950
-No, no!
-What?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.621
We're in the UndenNorld.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.919
Okay.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.673
Then, uh, Rumple must need my help.
That's why we're here.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.628
Wait.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.845
Hades.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.476
We're here because of me.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.267
And now I know why. My baby.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.143
Wait. Hades wants your baby?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.359
Hand her over.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.436
Please.

08:51.573 --> 08:55.441
No. No, nothing good ever
came of anyone trusting you.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.653
Give her to me.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.736
Belle, please.
Give her to me. I can keep her safe.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.120
Please! (GROANS)

09:01.833 --> 09:03.289
Belle!

09:03.543 --> 09:04.749
(GRUNTS)

09:05.170 --> 09:06.159
Belle!

09:08.965 --> 09:11.251
So, I heard someone of
the Munchkin persuasion

09:11.301 --> 09:13.633
tipped off Dorothy that I was still alive.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.510
Since you're all so fond of tattling,

09:16.639 --> 09:18.630
I'll give you the chance
to make it up to me.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.476
Where can I find the Scarecrow?

09:20.518 --> 09:22.634
We don't know! We swear!

09:22.687 --> 09:25.144
Fine, have it your way, Boq.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.641
Did that loosen your bearded lips?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.318
Or would you like to turn
into a pile of ash, too?

09:32.363 --> 09:35.105
HADES: Now, now.
No need to make more of a mess.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.653
Who the hell are you?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.985
Who the hell am I? That question
is more appropriate than you know.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.659
Please, allow me to introduce myself.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.209
I am Hades.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.324
Really?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.203
(MUNCHKINS WHIMPERING)

09:55.512 --> 09:56.501
HADES: Yes.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.842
(CHUCKLES)
My reputation precedes me.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.841
And to what do I owe this visit?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.634
Your handiwork has impressed me.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.678
You've sent so many my way.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.148
That last headless guard?
You have panache.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.353
True.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.810
But I sense there's something else.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.234
I heard a rumor that you are
dabbling in time travel,

10:17.367 --> 10:18.857
trying to achieve the unachievable.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.034
But it won't be unachievable for long.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.200
Which is why I'm here. I believe in you.

10:25.917 --> 10:26.906
(LAUGHS)

10:27.377 --> 10:29.038
Is the Devil flirting with me?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.285
(LAUGHS)

10:31.089 --> 10:33.205
I'm not the Devil.
People are always conflating us.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.998
No, I want to help you.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.043
This Scarecrow,
he's one of the ingredients you need?

10:38.721 --> 10:39.927
Yes.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.388
And I had him until a meddling
farm girl got in the way.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.261
-Ah. Dorothy.
-You know her?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.009
I did my research before I came.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.599
And from what I hear,
she's a powerful woman.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.107
So am I.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.723
(CHUCKLING) Yes, yes. I know. I know.

10:51.860 --> 10:56.445
But she has one thing you don't,
the love of the people.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.780
And, pardon me for saying so,

10:58.908 --> 11:01.069
(WHISPERS) but no one loves you.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.910
But there is a way to defeat her.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.540
(CHUCKLES) With an ally.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.877
And what does Hades need
with a time travel spell?

11:13.715 --> 11:16.047
All in good time, Zelena.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.424
All in good time.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.464
I don't need anyone's help.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.933
We haven't ordered yet.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.724
One dry wheat toast, one oatmeal.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.607
I know the orders of all the regulars.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.651
I'll get your cocoa.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.778
What?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.818
David, we're regulars.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.456
We were only
supposed to be here for a day

11:47.582 --> 11:49.618
and now we're regulars
at the diner in Hell.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.782
On the way to Hell.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.784
-You know what I mean.
-(S|GHS)

11:54.422 --> 11:57.334
You're thinking about Neal.
I do, too, all the time.

11:57.467 --> 12:01.961
If only we could talk to him.
If he could just hear our voices.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.797
Oh. You can do that.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.467
It's a simple Level 1 haunting.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.805
Lots of people do it here
until they lose interest

12:10.939 --> 12:14.431
in life and people and joy.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.684
I know where a booth is.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.527
A booth? For haunting?

12:20.657 --> 12:21.646
Where?

12:21.699 --> 12:22.814
Oh, here and there.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.775
What do you want?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.318
Breathe into this.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.537
The breath of a living
buys a lot on the black market here.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.284
(EXHALES)

12:35.546 --> 12:36.535
(SIGHS)

12:38.508 --> 12:39.543
Okay.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.667
Um, the booth is by the bus stop.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.672
Just pick up the phone

12:43.805 --> 12:45.670
and tell the operator
who you wish to haunt.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.343
Happy haunting.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.802
Let's go, Snow.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.553
Let's talk to our boy.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.560
(SIGHS) Riveting tale.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.853
Snow likes oatmeal.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.810
Is my morning breakfast in there, too?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.819
Henry, I thought you were
going to use your Author powers

13:02.865 --> 13:04.651
to get us to defeat Hades.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.566
I don't even remember writing this.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.034
Ijust woke up and had it done.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.410
Okay.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.870
It's really well written.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.864
And the illustrations are lovely.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.366
Maybe if you focus harder.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.001
Oh. So, you're all Authors now?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.002
Everyone's a writer.
Everyone's got an idea.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.208
I'm doing my best.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.088
Maybe if you just laid off
for a little bit.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.721
-Henry, where are you going?
-Upstairs.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.631
Well, we officially have
a teenager on our hands.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.715
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

13:30.893 --> 13:34.021
And a visitor
in our UndenNorld apartment?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.900
ROBIN HOOD: Zelena?

13:44.949 --> 13:48.237
SO, someone finally did you in.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.860
Sorry to disappoint,
but I'm very much alive.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.289
How did you get here?

13:52.415 --> 13:54.121
Through a portal.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.751
And I didn't come alone.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.038
Who else is here?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.294
Our baby.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.540
And she's in danger.

14:10.892 --> 14:11.972
WICKED WITCH: You again.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.258
Is it your birthday?

14:14.395 --> 14:17.057
I didn't know the King of the UndenNorld
was so nosy.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.971
I don't know the day I was born.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.484
But thank you for reminding me.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.104
That's actually a sad story.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.278
I only know the day
that my mother abandoned me.

14:26.949 --> 14:27.938
Getting sadder.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.988
So, this is what?
Celebrating abandonment day?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.657
I'm not celebrating anything.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.279
Please go.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.495
You know, when I offered to help you,

14:38.628 --> 14:41.165
yes, it was coming
from a place of self-interest.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.788
But I really do think I can help.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.000
You're thinking about your sister,

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
aren't you?

14:50.848 --> 14:51.963
How did you know that?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.807
I know exactly how you feel.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.099
She got everything you ever wanted,

14:58.856 --> 14:59.845
-(BLOWS)
-(FEEDBACK)

14:59.941 --> 15:02.148
and you got nothing. Am I warm?

15:03.820 --> 15:07.483
You know how some people say they
look up to their older siblings like gods?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.981
Well, my older brother is a god.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.154
Zeus. Ever hear of him?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.610
He got everything he ever wanted.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.825
He rules Mount Olympus,
while I'm trapped

15:17.625 --> 15:19.331
ruling the UndenNorld.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.167
He stopped my heart.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.296
Love, happiness, joy.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.297
They've all been taken from me.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.301
What I'm left with is only anger

15:30.346 --> 15:33.509
and a thirst for vengeance.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.007
I've survived on that
for quite some time.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.850
Only the kiss of

15:38.980 --> 15:42.143
true love can restart my heart

15:42.191 --> 15:47.060
and allow me to return
a fully formed man

15:47.196 --> 15:48.185
free of this curse.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.859
But, well,

15:52.201 --> 15:53.657
true love...

15:54.662 --> 15:58.325
No one is more hated
than the Lord of the UndenNorld.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.374
I could give you a run for your money.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.585
Yeah.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.250
Which is why

16:07.383 --> 16:08.668
WC

16:09.760 --> 16:12.547
must find your ingredients.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.217
I know where the Scarecrow is.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.930
Let me help you.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.893
Let me help us.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.899
If I can travel back,

16:26.944 --> 16:29.731
I can see to it that it is me

16:29.780 --> 16:31.771
who winds up on Olympus,

16:31.908 --> 16:34.069
and my brother

16:34.202 --> 16:35.692
who suffers.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.913
Well,

16:39.040 --> 16:41.247
you mightjust be as vindictive as I am.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.407
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

16:43.002 --> 16:44.242
(CHUCKLES)

16:46.631 --> 16:47.746
Where are you going?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.039
To find our daughter.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.927
What about a tracking spell?

16:52.053 --> 16:53.634
We don't have anything of the child's.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.594
I don't need magic. I can find her.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.429
I lived for years in the forest.
I can track anyone.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.092
I will find our daughter.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.019
(SIGHS)

17:18.788 --> 17:20.278

17:20.748 --> 17:22.909
What is this place?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.377
(METAL CLANKING)

17:29.173 --> 17:30.629
(WHIRRING)

(GASPS)

17:44.146 --> 17:45.135
Rumple.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.646
Belle?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.148
What are you doing here?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.647
(STAMMERS) You're not...

17:52.780 --> 17:54.020
-You didn't...
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.316
No, I'm alive.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.773
A portal brought me,

17:56.826 --> 17:59.659
and the baby, and Zelena.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.033
That's why the spell
didn't work as I thought.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.491
It brought over three bodies
instead of one.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.908
Well...

18:08.296 --> 18:11.663
You did this,
who were you trying to bring if not me?

18:11.799 --> 18:13.835
And you didn't know Zelena was back.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.794
No. Why would you steal a baby?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.803
No, no, no. It was Hades.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.302
He used leverage to force me.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.059
Look,

18:26.188 --> 18:29.726
a long time ago,
long before we even met,

18:29.859 --> 18:31.315
I made a deal.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.064
One I never thought would rear its head.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.362
What did you do?

18:36.490 --> 18:37.696
My boy was sick.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.401
In exchange for Baelfire's life,

18:41.537 --> 18:44.654
I made a deal to give up
my second-born child.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.160
Yeah, but you don't have
a second-born child.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.248
It happened, Belle.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.172
No.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.508
(STUTTERS) I'm pregnant?

18:59.221 --> 19:02.054
(SNIFFLES)
We're going to have a baby.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.724
A baby that you've already sold.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.766
Yes, but we can fix that.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.234
I'll use all my power. We can fix this.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.564
Power?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.109
What...

19:21.077 --> 19:23.068
You're the Dark One again.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.416
-No.
-Yes.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.211
You see, the thing is,

19:40.888 --> 19:43.049
I love this dagger.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.097
And I also love you. Both are possible.

19:50.064 --> 19:53.648
Look, you wanted me to be
a better man.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.813
And you've done that.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.901
But if you want me to be
a different man,

20:02.243 --> 20:03.779
I'm sorry.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.281
This is who I am.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.495
You weren't always.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.739
Yes, I was.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.122
Even when I was a coward,
I craved power.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.788
The only difference is, now I have it.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.629
And I won't let it go.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.593
Not again.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.264
Right. Not even for me?

20:27.977 --> 20:30.684
Belle, there's something
you must realize.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.981
Falling in love with
the man behind the beast

20:36.026 --> 20:37.527
isn't really what happened to you.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.152
You fell in love with me

20:41.699 --> 20:44.862
because there was a man and a beast.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.029
Neither exists without the other.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.831
No.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.829
No.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.170
I can't condone you being like this.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.001
Not again.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.043
Yes, you can.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.179
You just have to choose to.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.348
And if you do,

21:10.686 --> 21:12.893
we can have what's important.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.388
Family. Happiness.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.190
It's your choice.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.318
No. Um... (SNIFFLES)

21:21.864 --> 21:25.197
I'm not making any choices. Not now.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.368
Not until you get me back to our friends.

21:31.248 --> 21:35.207
And you fix all of this.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.040
Then that's what I shall do.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.380
But you'll see I'm right.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.717
You'll see.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.886
(WIND WHISTLING)

21:51.936 --> 21:53.426
How does this even work?

21:53.562 --> 21:56.725
I don't know how much time it gives us.
Do we just talk? Or...

21:56.857 --> 21:58.848
Oh, I think we should sing a little song.
He likes our singing.

21:58.901 --> 21:59.936
I don't think it really matters.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.902
I think it's just about
Neal hearing our voices.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.270
Yeah. But how does that work, anyway?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.398
Does it go directly into his ears?
Does it repeat on a loop?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.406
Excuse me.
Do you know how this works?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.245
I mean, on the other side?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.250
No idea.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.584
I don't even know
if the messages get through.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.582
I hope so.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.086
Or I've wasted a lot of time
these past 30 years.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.806
Okay, come on.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.263
Okay.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.807
ZELENA: Before we find my daughter,
would you do me the courtesy

22:40.943 --> 22:43.901
of sharing with me whatever
horrid name you saddled her with?

22:44.321 --> 22:48.405
Probably something dreadful
like Brittany or Nancy or...

22:49.285 --> 22:50.775
Oh, God. Not Marian.

22:51.412 --> 22:55.781
Zelena, I haven't named our child
because I need to know her first.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.497
To find out who she really is.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.666
Which I haven't been able to do
because I've been too busy

22:59.795 --> 23:01.296
protecting her from you.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.249
You weren't protecting her at all.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.166
You just left her
so you could go on some heroic quest.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.794
I mean, how is finding some pirate
more important than our child?

23:09.847 --> 23:12.589
Helping friends,
setting an example of heroism,

23:12.641 --> 23:13.756
that is important.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.601
You know, Zelena,
I used to be just like you.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.270
Oh, please. Don't flatter yourself.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.769
When I was the Evil Queen,
I spent every day

23:23.819 --> 23:25.605
not giving a damn about anyone.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.819
And in return,

23:28.198 --> 23:30.280
no one cared about me.

23:31.493 --> 23:35.486
I thought all I needed was my
vengeance to keep me warm at night.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.995
But then something happened.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.948
My enemies

23:39.835 --> 23:41.496
became my family.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.668
And that's when I finally felt happy.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.007
That is why I'm here.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.547
They need my help.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.796
And when family needs help,
you step up.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.177
In case you've forgotten,

23:56.226 --> 23:58.683
there is someone I love
who needs my help.

23:58.812 --> 23:59.847
My daughter.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.515
SO, if we could get on with finding her,

24:04.568 --> 24:05.978
that would be just brilliant.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.980
What are we doing here?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.532

first landed in Oz.

Oh, right. They don't have these in Oz.

going to help us find the Scarecrow?

37:02.303 --> 37:03.634
Because that's What I would do.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.465
No.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.092
You want revenge.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.224
And until you get it,
you Will never be satisfied.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.562
You need this spell.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.137
You need to go back
to beat your brother.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.310
Just like I need to go back
to beat my sister.

37:17.277 --> 37:18.562
Love is not enough!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.109
No, Zelena.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.272
I don't want that anymore. I want you.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.401
I love you.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.617
No one could love me.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.174
But if you did,

37:41.342 --> 37:44.584
you wouldn't want to take away
my best chance at revenge.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.339
Go back to your brimstone.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.516
I never want to see your face again.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.191
You Will regret this, Zelena.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.789
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

38:19.172 --> 38:21.037
ZELENA: Hello, Hades.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.672
Zelena.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.218
You know, I was looking for you.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.470
You were looking for my baby.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.301
I was just a happy accident.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.385
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.479
Yes, you were.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.892
But When I heard you fell through
my little portal,

38:42.487 --> 38:44.318
I really was looking for you.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.397
I know. I thought I'd make it easy.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.741
I know that you want my child
for your time travel spell.

38:51.246 --> 38:52.235
(CHUCKLES)

38:52.831 --> 38:55.493
If you touch her, I Will demolish you.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.663
There's no need for that.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.414
I wouldn't hurt you.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.587
I never would've hurt you.

39:06.928 --> 39:10.216
That's the thing about true love.
It endures. It can't be broken.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.717
What? SO, sending Rumplestiltskin
after my daughter

39:15.770 --> 39:18.603
had nothing to do With
revenge on your brother?

39:18.731 --> 39:20.187
Zelena... (SIGHS)

39:20.942 --> 39:24.105
I was trying to rescue her
from those miserable heroes for you.

39:24.237 --> 39:25.773
I didn't know you were there.

39:26.656 --> 39:27.941
(CHUCKLES)

39:29.200 --> 39:31.737
Despite everything I've done,
you've loved me all this time.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.408
(LAUGHS) Look around you.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.741
I mean, aren't you curious
Why this place

39:41.045 --> 39:42.251
looks like Storybrooke?

39:43.506 --> 39:46.088
(LAUGHING) I did it for you.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.545
I saW how much
you wanted to cast the Dark Curse

39:48.636 --> 39:50.718
to get everything your sister had.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.878
(CHUCKLES)

39:53.224 --> 39:55.135
You made me
my very own Storybrooke.

39:55.810 --> 39:59.302
(LAUGHS) I gave you What you wanted,
What she had.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.304
It's not perfect.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.311
The UndenNorld is a place of,

40:07.155 --> 40:08.565
well, destruction.

40:09.449 --> 40:13.317
Despite my best intentions,
things don't grow here.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.827
They decay.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.827
But it's our decay.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.661
Zelena,

40:26.799 --> 40:28.664
wouldn't it be nice

40:29.677 --> 40:33.295
to not be alone anymore?

40:34.515 --> 40:37.757
After all these years, I still choose you.

40:39.395 --> 40:42.353
(EXHALES) What better revenge
is there than having it all?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.680
(WHIMPERS)

40:43.816 --> 40:44.942
But I had it all.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.024
And then I gave them back my baby

40:47.111 --> 40:49.318
because I thought that
you wanted to hurt her.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.528
Well, then, we'll just have to go back
and get her, won't we?

40:55.662 --> 40:58.870
(BREATHING HEAVILY) No. No.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.616
(SOBS) I want to trust you, I do.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.542
But you still can't. I understand.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.708
I'm sorry.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.629
It's too much.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.136
I Will get my daughter back.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.223
And I'll do it all on my own.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.638
April 15th.

41:28.236 --> 41:29.567
What?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.699
Your birthday.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.067
I just thought you might want to know.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.735
HOW do you know that?

41:39.205 --> 41:41.366
Tortured it out of a miller's daughter.

41:41.958 --> 41:42.947
(CHUCKLES)

41:43.376 --> 41:44.912
Don't worry.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.536
I took care of her, too.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.580
For you.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.010
I know you don't need me.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.381
You don't need anyone.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.263
But if you change your mind

42:00.727 --> 42:02.763
and decide you want me,

42:05.523 --> 42:07.514
I'll be waiting for you.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.728
At home.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.111
Just like I always have.

42:14.574 --> 42:15.563
(EXHALES)
