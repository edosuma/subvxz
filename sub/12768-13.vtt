BUT IT'S EITHER THAT
OR ADOPTION.
NO.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.208
MAYA COULD MOVE IN
WITH ONE OF US,

09:37.250 --> 09:40.375
AND--AND WE COULD HELP
RAISE THE BABY--
NO.

09:40.417 --> 09:42.375
OR WE COULD
PAY FOR EVERYTHING

09:42.417 --> 09:45.000
AND--AND HELP HER LIVE
AS--AS NORMALLY AS POSSIBLE.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.041
NO, SAM. NO. NO.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.041
I AM SORRY.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.709
I AM DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN,
BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.709
I CAN'T HOLD HER HAND
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
I'M NOT HOLDING HER HAND.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.041
SAM, YOU ARE TREATING
THIS MARRIAGE LIKE IT IS

09:57.083 --> 09:59.041
A REAL POSSIBILITY.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
DID I S--

09:59.083 --> 10:01.625
DID I SAY THAT?
I DON'T THINK HE SAID THAT.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.625
I-I DIDN'T HEAR IT
THAT WAY.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.917
UH, I KNOW
AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY

10:06.959 --> 10:09.458
CAN WREAK HAVOC
WITH A RELATIONSHIP.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.959
UH, BUT--BUT YOU TWO
CAN GET THROUGH THIS

10:15.000 --> 10:19.041
WITHOUT TEARING
EACH OTHER APART.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.041
YOU WANTED ME TO COME UP.
I CAME UP.

10:21.083 --> 10:25.792
PLEASE. YOU CAN'T EVEN SIT HERE
AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE...

10:25.834 --> 10:27.792
THIS BABY IS COMING.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.000
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
BUT IT'S COMING.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.250
ALL THE CHOICES ARE BAD.
I KNOW THAT.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.792
BUT WE CAN'T BURY OUR HEADS
IN THE SAND,

10:34.834 --> 10:38.041
AND YOU CAN'T SIT THERE
AND SAY "NO" TO EVERY SUG--

10:38.083 --> 10:40.041
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
RIGHT NOW, I'M SORRY.

10:40.083 --> 10:44.667
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS ALL THAT I HAVE.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.959
GREAT. THAT HELPED.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.041
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.583
ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

10:54.625 --> 10:58.208
I THINK THAT WAS
A-A GOOD START.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.041
"FOR TILL
THAT WAS FINISHED"...

11:01.083 --> 11:03.041
SHE'S DRAWN HER LINE
IN THE SAND.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.041
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.500
HEY, YOU TWO...

11:07.542 --> 11:10.500
YOU HAVE HUNG TOGETHER
THROUGH THIS FROM THE BEGINNING.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.583
DON'T LET THIS
GET BETWEEN YOU.

11:12.625 --> 11:15.166
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE.
NO ONE COULD MAKE IT.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.208
THE THING IS...

11:20.250 --> 11:23.041
I CAN.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.208
WE ALL SAY
WE LOVE OUR KIDS EQUALLY,

11:25.250 --> 11:29.083
AND I LOVE MY GIRLS,
BOTH OF 'EM.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.667
BUT PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD...

11:31.709 --> 11:33.375
AND I COULD.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.375
I COULD CHOOSE.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.250
WHAT DOES THAT SAY
ABOUT ME, HMM?

11:40.291 --> 11:43.625
WHAT KIND OF MAN
DOES THAT MAKE ME?

11:54.792 --> 11:56.000
HONEY.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.917
I LOVE NIKI
WITH ALL OF MY HEART,

12:00.959 --> 12:04.041
AND IF I COULD GIVE MY LIFE
TO SAVE HERS, I WOULD.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.041
YOU KNOW THAT.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.500
JUST--I CAN'T
WATCH THEM BOTH DIE.

12:09.542 --> 12:13.166
THIS ISN'T FAIR, RENEE.
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ANY OF US.
NO!

12:13.208 --> 12:16.166
GIVE THE CORD BLOOD TO KELLI
BEFORE SHE GETS WORSE.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.000
NO. I WON'T ALLOW IT.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.500
EITHER THEY BOTH GET IT
OR NEITHER.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.041
RENEE--
NO!

12:22.083 --> 12:23.667
YOU'RE GOING TO HELL.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.625
(door opens)

12:28.083 --> 12:30.166
SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.917
(footsteps approach)

12:36.959 --> 12:41.041
(sighs) I'VE BEEN
DOING THE SAME THING...

12:41.083 --> 12:44.250
E-EVER SINCE DINK MENTIONED
THE WORD "MARRIAGE."

12:44.291 --> 12:48.333
DOESN'T TAKE A DOCTOR
TO DIAGNOSE MY HEADACHE.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.041
CORINNE DAVIS.
SAM BENNETT.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.917
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.917
IS MAYA'S MOTHER
GOING TO JOIN US?

12:53.959 --> 12:57.041
UH, NO. SHE--SHE--
SHE'S TIED UP.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.458
OH.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.417
OKAY. WELL, UM...

13:00.458 --> 13:05.041
I--IT'S JUST ME ON...
ON OUR END, SO...

13:05.083 --> 13:09.041
I-I KNOW THIS IS
ALL AWKWARD AND AWFUL.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.041
BUT SHE'S LOVELY,
YOUR DAUGHTER...

13:11.083 --> 13:12.875
(chuckles) AND FUNNY.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.041
I-I DO LOVE
SEEING THEM TOGETHER.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.041
YOU KNOW MAYA?

13:17.083 --> 13:19.125
ALL THE TIME
SHE SPENDS AT OUR HOUSE.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.041
HUH.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.041
THEY CAME TO ME
AFTER YOU SAID NO,

13:23.083 --> 13:24.583
AND WE TALKED.

13:24.625 --> 13:28.083
AND, UM, I HAVE
A GUESTHOUSE IN THE BACK.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.792
IT'S NOT HUGE,
BUT THEY COULD MOVE IN THERE.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.542
I-I WORK DURING THE WEEK,

13:33.583 --> 13:36.166
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT SOME KIND OF DAY CARE.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.000
BUT I-I COME HOME EARLY,
SO I COULD HELP.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.041
AND DINK--HE'LL COME HOME
AFTER SCHOOL

13:41.083 --> 13:43.417
OR AFTER HIS BAND PRACTICE
OR SOMETHING,

13:43.458 --> 13:46.208
AND--AND, UM, I DON'T KNOW
MAYA'S SCHEDULE,

13:46.250 --> 13:48.625
BUT BETWEEN THE THREE OF US

13:48.667 --> 13:50.625
AND--AND YOU AND YOUR--
WELL, MAYA'S MOTHER,

13:50.667 --> 13:52.625
AND WHATEVER
YOU'RE WILLING TO DO,

13:52.667 --> 13:56.000
I THINK THAT WE CAN TRY
TO HELP THEM...

13:56.041 --> 13:57.959
MAKE THIS WORK.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.834
SO THEN,
YOU'RE BEHIND THIS?

13:59.875 --> 14:03.041
YOU'RE BEHIND 2
15 YEAR OLDS GETTING MARRIED

14:03.083 --> 14:05.000
AND PLAYING HOUSE?

14:05.041 --> 14:06.041
(sighs)

14:06.083 --> 14:07.834
I KNOW IT'S CRAZY.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.834
I-I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT

14:09.875 --> 14:12.083
FOR MYSELF, TOO, YOU KNOW,
AND...

14:12.125 --> 14:14.875
M-MAYBE IT'S CRAZY
THAT IT'S CRAZY, YOU KNOW?

14:14.917 --> 14:17.250
I MEAN, WE TRY AND TEACH
OUR KIDS RESPONSIBILITY

14:17.291 --> 14:22.041
AND--AND THAT FAMILY
IS IMPORTANT.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.458
I MEAN,
FOR MOST OF HISTORY,

14:24.500 --> 14:27.041
THIS IS
WHEN KIDS GOT MARRIED.

14:27.083 --> 14:30.041
AND--AND IN SOME PARTS
OF THE COUNTRY, IT STILL IS.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.667
OKAY. EXCUSE ME.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.750
UH, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW YOUR SON,

14:33.792 --> 14:35.458
HARDLY AT ALL.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.458
BUT MY DAUGHTER?
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.750
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED
A HUSBAND.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.041
SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T NEED
A HOUSE.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.125
UH, WHAT SHE DOES NEED
IS A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION.

14:46.166 --> 14:49.250
AND SHE'S GOING TO GET ONE.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.250
IF SHE GETS MARRIED,

14:51.291 --> 14:53.667
SHE'LL HAVE SOMEONE ELSE
TO THINK ABOUT,

14:53.709 --> 14:57.667
AND HER CHOICES
WILL BE LIMITED.
OR SHE'LL HAVE SOMEONE WHO
SUPPORTS HER IN THOSE CHOICES.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.875
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE AGAINST THIS,

14:59.917 --> 15:02.250
BUT IF YOU DON'T SIGN
THESE PAPERS,

15:02.291 --> 15:04.375
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

15:04.417 --> 15:08.291
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY RUN OFF
OR--OR WORSE?

15:08.333 --> 15:12.166
LOOK, THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED
FOR MY KID EITHER.

15:12.208 --> 15:15.709
BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM
CLOSE BY,

15:15.750 --> 15:17.709
RIGHT OR WRONG,

15:17.750 --> 15:22.959
SO WE COULD PICK UP THE PIECES
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.291
(sighs)

15:24.333 --> 15:26.625
(monitor beeping erratically)
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.041
YOU GOTTA HELP HER.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.417
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
CAN SOMEONE TAKE KELLI
OUT OF THE ROOM, PLEASE?

15:31.458 --> 15:33.709
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HER.
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.041
JUST GO WITH THE NURSE.
OKAY, SHE'S SEPTIC.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.458
I NEED A C.B.C.
AND A CHEM PANEL TIMES TWO.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.625
WE'RE GONNA SET UP
A CENTRAL LINE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

15:41.667 --> 15:45.041
SHE HAS AN INFECTION.
SHE MAY HAVE RELAPSED.
(whispers) OH, GOD.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.041
OH, MY GOD.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.041
GET AWAY FROM HER.
RENEE.

15:49.083 --> 15:52.041
YOU SAID IT, AND IT HAPPENED.
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
I DIDN'T MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.875
YOU SAID IT,
AND IT HAPPENED. GET OUT.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.667
GET OUT!

15:57.709 --> 16:00.208

THE DYING TWINS' FATHER

16:15.083 --> 16:16.458

BUT SHE HAD TO FINISH.

19:36.625 --> 19:40.792
EVEN BACK THEN, SHE WAS--
SHE WAS SO STUBBORN.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.750
SHE'S JUST...

19:42.792 --> 19:46.041
SO CUTE AND STUBBORN
AND JUST...

19:46.083 --> 19:47.875
DETERMINED...

19:47.917 --> 19:48.959
(sighs)

19:49.041 --> 19:50.959

19:51.000 --> 19:53.041
SAM.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.000

OH, THERE YOU ARE.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.000
HEY. YOU FOUND ME.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.041
I TALKED TO NAOMI.
I GOT HER TO RECONSIDER.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.333
SHE'S IN THERE WITH VIOLET.
SO IF YOU'RE FREE,

21:57.375 --> 22:00.458

WELL, THIS IS REALLY HELPING.

22:10.333 --> 22:14.125
GOOD. 'CAUSE...
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.959
I KNOW.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.417
HER FEVER'S DOWN,

22:26.458 --> 22:28.959
AND SHE'S STABILIZED
FOR THE TIME BEING.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.417
MAYBE RENEE WAS RIGHT.
I SAID IT OUT LOUD AND--

22:31.458 --> 22:34.041
YOU DID NOT WILL THIS
TO HAPPEN.
BUT I CHOSE.

22:34.083 --> 22:36.083
GOD'S PUNISHING ME.
AND NIKI--

22:36.125 --> 22:39.417
NIKI IS FIGHTING,
AND SHE'S A STRONG GIRL.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.041
BUT, UM...
THIS DOES CHANGE THINGS.

22:42.083 --> 22:45.000
I THINK I COULD
GET HER INTO REMISSION,

22:45.041 --> 22:47.875
BUT WE'LL NEED TO USE THE CORD
BLOOD TO REALLY GIVE HER A SHOT.
BUT THE LONGER WE WAIT,

22:47.917 --> 22:49.875
THIS COULD HAPPEN
TO KELLI, TOO.

22:49.917 --> 22:52.583
AND THEN WE'D BE
RIGHT BACK HERE.
I KNOW.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.166
NO. WE NEED TO DO THIS.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.375
DO THE TRANSFUSION ON KELLI.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.041
OKAY, I CAN'T DO THAT

22:59.083 --> 23:01.041
WITHOUT GETTING PERMISSION
FROM BOTH OF YOU.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.125
THEN I'LL GET A COURT ORDER.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.125
I'M NOT GONNA LET KELLI DIE

23:05.166 --> 23:07.583
BECAUSE HER MOTHER
CAN'T MAKE A CHOICE.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.041
CELEBRATING
OUR DAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE

23:12.083 --> 23:14.917
WITH A BUNCH
OF PREP SCHOOL KIDS...

23:14.959 --> 23:19.458
HAVING DINK AND MAYA
MOVE INTO YOUR HOUSE

23:19.500 --> 23:21.458
AND HAVE SEX
IN YOUR GUEST ROOM

23:21.500 --> 23:24.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE MARRIED,

23:24.041 --> 23:26.000
WATCHING YOU WALK
OUR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

23:26.041 --> 23:28.667
DOWN THE AISLE
TO MARRY SOME BOY NAMED DINK...

23:28.709 --> 23:31.792
I MEAN, DO WE--DO WE EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIS REAL NAME IS, SAM,

23:31.834 --> 23:34.792
THIS--THIS BOY--THIS BOY THAT
WANTS TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER?

23:34.834 --> 23:36.792
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT I SUPPORT IT.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.041
I JUST--I...

23:39.083 --> 23:42.083
I JUST THINK THAT THE, UH,
THE BABY SHOULD HAVE A FATHER.

23:42.125 --> 23:44.959
Y-YOUR MOTHER
IS A GREAT WOMAN.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.959
I KNOW,
AND SHE WORKED TWO JOBS

23:47.000 --> 23:50.041
AND SHE'S OVERPROTECTIVE,
AND I LOVE HER FOR IT.

23:50.083 --> 23:53.041
BUT MAYBE
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER

23:53.083 --> 23:55.333
IF MY FATHER
WERE TO HAVE BEEN THERE.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.333
I THINK
SAM'S JUST POINTING OUT

23:57.375 --> 23:59.750
THAT TWO PARENTS
COULD BE BETTER THAN ONE.

23:59.792 --> 24:01.417
NAOMI...

24:01.458 --> 24:04.041
I-I THINK THAT SAM
JUST WANTS YOU TO THINK ABOUT

24:04.083 --> 24:05.750
WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.041
I DON'T LIKE IT, NAI.

24:12.083 --> 24:15.041
BUT... (sighs)

24:15.083 --> 24:18.583
THEY SAY
THAT THEY'RE M.F.E.O.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.542
M-M.F.E.O.?
OH, GOD.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.959
MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
AND, NO, THEY ARE NOT, SAM.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.041
THEY ARE NOT.

24:26.083 --> 24:28.875
(sighs)

24:28.917 --> 24:31.875
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORE,

24:31.917 --> 24:34.542
BUT I JUST CAN'T.
I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.667
I WISH I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.041
OKAY. WELL...

24:38.083 --> 24:40.667
DINK'S MOTHER IS COMING BACK
THIS AFTERNOON.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.750
IF YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.750
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
SOME DECISIONS

24:44.792 --> 24:47.333
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

24:54.417 --> 24:56.375
THERE'S NO WAY!
I WON'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.208
NO, YOU'LL JUST WATCH
BOTH GIRLS DIE!

24:58.250 --> 25:01.083
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. STOP! STOP.
THIS IS AWFUL. I KNOW IT IS,
WHOA, WHOA.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.166
BUT YOU NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR THEM.

25:03.208 --> 25:06.041
WE SHOULD LET NIKI DIE?
NO, YOU SHOULD LET
ONE OF THEM LIVE.

25:06.083 --> 25:09.166
YOU SHOULD GIVE THE CORD BLOOD
TO NIKI BECAUSE SHE'S WEAK

25:09.208 --> 25:11.500
AND SHE NEEDS IT. YOU SHOULD
GIVE IT TO KELLI

25:11.542 --> 25:13.709
SO YOU DON'T LOSE HER, TOO.
I DON'T KNOW.

25:13.750 --> 25:17.291
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE'S BEST,
WHICH YOU CAN LIVE WITH.
I CAN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN
ONE CHILD AND ANOTHER.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.917
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

25:18.959 --> 25:22.333
YOU HAD A BABY YESTERDAY.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED AT HIM.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.583
I WANT TO LOVE HIM.

25:27.709 --> 25:29.875
I JUST...

25:29.917 --> 25:34.041
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S GONNA REPLACE THEM.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.667
I CAN'T FACE THAT.

25:37.709 --> 25:40.041
(sighs) NO ONE
WANTS TO FACE THIS.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.792
BUT WE HAVE TO.

25:49.375 --> 25:52.333
UH, CAN YOU COME WITH ME
TO THE EXAM ROOM?

25:52.375 --> 25:54.125
YOU NEED A CONSULT?

25:54.166 --> 25:57.041
NO. MAYA'S THERE.

25:57.083 --> 26:01.458
MAYA, ARE YOU OKAY?
DELL SAID YOU WERE OKAY.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.709
YEAH, I'M FINE.
I JUST...

26:03.750 --> 26:06.041
SHOW HIM.
YEP.

26:06.083 --> 26:08.250
(ultrasound whooshing)

26:08.291 --> 26:09.625
OKAY.

26:09.667 --> 26:12.208
UM... HERE'S THE HEART.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.417
IT'S BEATING STRONG.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.041
AND THE HEAD.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.625
(whooshing continues)

26:19.667 --> 26:22.000
IT'S PRETTY COOL, HUH?

26:27.417 --> 26:29.542
(footsteps approach)

26:29.583 --> 26:31.750
(Addison)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:31.792 --> 26:33.667
UH...

26:33.709 --> 26:35.875
TRYING NOT TO EAT
THE CHOCOLATE.

26:35.917 --> 26:38.917
HOW'S THAT GOING FOR YOU?

26:38.959 --> 26:40.917
NOT GOOD,
BUT IF I EAT IT,

26:40.959 --> 26:42.917
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN
FOR 5 MILES

26:42.959 --> 26:44.542
ON THE TREADMILL TONIGHT,

26:44.583 --> 26:48.041
AND I DON'T, UH, I DON'T THINK
I HAVE 5 MILES IN ME.
IT'S JUST ONE CHOCOLATE.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.834
NO,
IT'S THE GATEWAY CHOCOLATE.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.834
I EAT ONE, I EAT THEM ALL.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.834
IT'S JUST FOOD, NAI.
IT'S NOT A SOLUTION.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.250
BUT IT'S WHAT I CAN DO.

26:55.291 --> 26:58.000
EVERYTHING ELSE, UM...

26:59.542 --> 27:03.041
IT'S LIKE I'M 13.

27:03.083 --> 27:08.000
YEAH, I KNOW THAT I AM
A CALM, RATIONAL PERSON

27:08.041 --> 27:10.000
WITH MANY GRADUATE DEGREES.

27:10.041 --> 27:11.709
I RUN MY OWN BUSINESS,

27:11.750 --> 27:15.458
AND I AM A STRONG,
SMART ADULT.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.458
AND, UH, YET, I HAVE
A 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

27:18.500 --> 27:21.291
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A LIFE.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.083
AND, UH...

27:23.125 --> 27:26.458
THE ONLY WAY I CAN COPE
WITH THAT IS THIS.
(drops box on desk)

27:26.500 --> 27:28.458
WHICH IS WHAT I DID
WHEN I WAS 13.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.458
IT WAS ALWAYS JUST ME
AND THE CHOCOLATE,

27:30.500 --> 27:32.041
ME AND THE FOOD.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.041
AND, UH, I KNOW
IT'S RIDICULOUS, AND...

27:34.083 --> 27:37.041
I KNOW THAT I AM BURYING
MY HEAD IN THE SAND,

27:37.083 --> 27:40.083
BUT IT'S...
WHAT I CAN DO.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.417
I CAN DO THIS.
I CAN DO THIS CHOCOLATE.

27:42.458 --> 27:45.041
I CAN, UM... I'M IN CHARGE
OF THIS CHOCOLATE

27:45.083 --> 27:46.417
AND MY BATTLE WITH FOOD.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.291
THIS I CAN DO.

27:48.333 --> 27:52.041
I CAN'T DO MAYA
AND BABIES AND MARRIAGE.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.417
(paper rustles)

27:53.458 --> 27:56.041
I KNOW YOU CAN'T.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.041
BUT YOU... PULLING OUT,

27:58.083 --> 28:01.083
YOU'RE LEAVING SAM TO
FIGURE THIS OUT ON HIS OWN.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.583
AND I'M THERE,
AND I'M TRYING TO HELP,

28:03.625 --> 28:07.417
BUT... I'M NOT...

28:07.458 --> 28:10.083
EVEN SURE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT.

28:10.125 --> 28:12.041
FEEL ABOUT WHAT?

28:12.083 --> 28:14.458
ME AND SAM...
HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.041
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

28:17.083 --> 28:20.041
I MEAN, WE LIVE NEXT DOOR
TO EACH OTHER, WE SIT AND TALK,

28:20.083 --> 28:22.041
AND, UH... I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S...

28:22.083 --> 28:24.041
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S--IT'S LIKE...

28:24.083 --> 28:28.000
SAM AND I ARE THE COUPLE.
(chuckles)

28:29.834 --> 28:31.500
(chuckles)

28:33.458 --> 28:35.041
(laughs)

28:35.083 --> 28:37.417
OH, THAT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

28:37.458 --> 28:40.792
WHAT, YOU AND SAM?
(laughing)

28:40.834 --> 28:44.083
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY. YEAH.

28:44.125 --> 28:46.208
(continues laughing)
THANK YOU FOR THAT,

28:46.250 --> 28:48.625
FOR MAKING ME LAUGH.
(chuckles)

28:48.667 --> 28:51.583
I NEEDED THAT.
OH, MY GOD. YOU AND SAM.

28:51.625 --> 28:55.208
OH, GOD. THAT IS JUST WRONG
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.250
OH! (continues laughing)

28:57.291 --> 29:00.333
IT'S LIKE, FIRST YOU SLEEP WITH
YOUR HUSBAND'S BEST FRIEND

29:00.375 --> 29:02.917
AND THEN YOU SLEEP WITH
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S HUSBAND.

29:02.959 --> 29:04.917
(chuckles)
(continues laughing)
OH, MY GOD.

29:04.959 --> 29:07.166
YOU--YOU--YOU WOULD BE
THE WORST PERSON EVER.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.917
YOU WOULD NEED
THESE CHOCOLATES.

29:09.959 --> 29:12.041
(continues laughing)
YEAH. NUH.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.041
UH-HUH.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.458
MM.
(continues laughing)

29:18.000 --> 29:20.959
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:29.542 --> 29:32.625
I CAN'T DO THIS.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.709
I CAN'T BREAK THEIR HEARTS.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.250
YOU DO IT.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.041
LET ME?

29:56.792 --> 29:58.750
ARE MOM AND DAD
STILL FIGHTING?

29:58.792 --> 30:01.542
NO, NO. NO.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.458
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH TREVOR?

30:03.500 --> 30:06.375
NO. HE'S FINE.
TREVOR'S FINE.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.250
BUT HERE'S THE THING--

30:08.291 --> 30:10.250
WE WERE ALL HOPING
THAT TREVOR'S BLOOD

30:10.291 --> 30:14.041
WAS GONNA HELP YOU BOTH
GET BETTER.
WE'RE NOT
GOING TO GET BETTER?

30:14.083 --> 30:17.458
WELL, NIKI IS TOO SICK TO HAVE
THE TREATMENT RIGHT NOW.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.709
WELL, I'M FEELING BETTER,
THOUGH.

30:19.750 --> 30:23.041
I KNOW, AND THAT'S GOOD.

30:23.083 --> 30:27.041
BUT YOUR BODY'S TOO WEAK
FOR THE BLOOD TO HELP YOU.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.959
AND SO WE NEED TO GIVE IT
TO KELLI.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.542
HOW LONG TILL I GET IT?

30:38.583 --> 30:41.834
WELL, THAT'S THE THING,
SWEETIE.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.417
THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

30:48.750 --> 30:52.542
I CAN SHARE
SO WE CAN BOTH GET IT.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.542
I KNOW. I WISH THAT WAS
THE WAY THAT IT WORKS.

30:55.583 --> 30:57.041
BUT IT DOESN'T.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.041
BUT... (sniffles)

31:01.083 --> 31:04.083
IF WE BOTH DON'T GET IT...

31:06.083 --> 31:08.625
(crying) I DON'T WANT IT.
I DON'T WANT IT.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.583
WE DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER,
EVERYTHING THE SAME.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.625
(sniffling)

31:17.667 --> 31:21.959
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET BETTER.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.834
IT'S LUCKY.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.458
SO YOU'LL GET BETTER.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.834
OKAY?

31:35.542 --> 31:37.417
(cries)

31:45.125 --> 31:48.750
(Corinne speaks indistinctly)

31:50.625 --> 31:53.583
NAOMI.
MOM... YOU CAME.

31:53.625 --> 31:56.041
YEAH, I CAME.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.041
I'M... SO GLAD
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.166
I'M, UH, SORRY
THAT I WAS LATE.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.083
WELL, I'M--I'M HERE.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.542
(Corinne) BOY,
I-I KNOW THAT THIS

32:05.583 --> 32:08.083
HAS BEEN HARD ON ALL OF US.

32:08.125 --> 32:11.041
THEY'VE PUT US IN
A DIFFICULT SITUATION.

32:11.083 --> 32:15.208
I KNOW THAT WE ALL FEEL
A LITTLE... SCARED.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.417
BUT WE ARE ALL
IN THE SAME POSITION, SO--

32:17.458 --> 32:20.125
EXCUSE ME. NO, WE ARE--
WE ARE NOT,

32:20.166 --> 32:21.875
UH, IN THE SAME POSITION.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.041
YOUR SON CAN WALK AWAY,
AND, UH,

32:24.083 --> 32:26.834
MY DAUGHTER IS STUCK WITH THIS
IN HER BELLY FOR NINE MONTHS.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.125
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT HERE.

32:29.166 --> 32:31.458
MY SON IS NOT WALKING AWAY.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.834
YOU'RE MISSING MY POINT.
HE COULD.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.583
MOM--
MRS. BENNETT,

32:35.625 --> 32:37.333
I...

32:37.375 --> 32:40.917
DR. BENNETT, MA'AM...

32:43.417 --> 32:45.417
I DON'T WANT TO WALK AWAY.

32:48.083 --> 32:51.667
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I DO.

32:51.709 --> 32:54.000
BUT, UM, THIS IDEA...

32:54.041 --> 32:56.375
THIS MARRIAGE...

32:56.417 --> 32:58.375
I SAID
THAT I WOULD...

32:58.417 --> 33:00.959
SIGN THE CONSENT.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.333
WE ALL...

33:02.375 --> 33:05.333
ALL OF US HAD
A REALLY GOOD TALK.

33:05.375 --> 33:09.125
YOU WEREN'T HERE,
SO... WE DECIDED.

33:09.166 --> 33:11.041
MOM...

33:11.083 --> 33:15.208
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

33:15.250 --> 33:18.625
I WANT YOU
TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.333
I GUESS THAT'S NOT
FOR ME TO SAY.

33:27.875 --> 33:31.041
HIS NAME IS FILLMORE.

33:31.083 --> 33:35.166
DINK--IT'S JUST...
JUST A NICKNAME...

33:35.208 --> 33:37.000
MA'AM.

33:43.917 --> 33:47.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:47.375 --> 33:50.375
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

33:53.875 --> 33:55.834
JERRY.

33:55.875 --> 33:58.208
HEY.

33:58.250 --> 33:59.834
UM...

33:59.875 --> 34:02.375
NIKI NEEDS YOU.

34:10.458 --> 34:13.417
DADDY.

34:13.458 --> 34:16.667
I AM SO SORRY, BABY.

34:16.709 --> 34:18.917
COME HERE.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.834
(footsteps approach)

34:27.083 --> 34:32.333
I WANTED NIKI TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH HER BROTHER.

34:38.959 --> 34:42.000
(Trevor cooing)

35:02.166 --> 35:05.041
I TRIED.

35:05.083 --> 35:10.041
I TRIED TO ENGAGE,
BUT... I WAS TOO LATE.

35:10.083 --> 35:12.750
AND NOW I...

35:12.792 --> 35:14.750
Y-YOU KNOW, I USED TO--

35:14.792 --> 35:17.125
I USED TO THINK OF MYSELF
AS A GOOD PERSON.

35:17.166 --> 35:20.208
YOU KNOW, I WAS--I WAS
A GOOD FRIEND, A GOOD MOTHER

35:20.250 --> 35:22.542
AND A GOOD EX-WIFE.

35:22.583 --> 35:26.000
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED,
AND NOW I...

35:26.041 --> 35:28.667
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GET IT.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.792
WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
WITH LUCAS AND WALKING AWAY,

35:31.834 --> 35:33.792
I DIDN'T GET IT.

35:33.834 --> 35:36.750
AND I KNOW MAYA'S NOT LIKE THAT,
BUT I GET IT NOW.

35:36.792 --> 35:41.250
I DO. I'M SORRY.

35:41.291 --> 35:43.250
YOU DON'T GET IT.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.458
YOU DON'T...

35:45.500 --> 35:47.458
I DIDN'T
WALK AWAY FROM MY CHILD

35:47.500 --> 35:49.458
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
DEAL WITH HIM

35:49.500 --> 35:52.291
OR BECAUSE I WANTED
TO CONTROL WHAT HE DID.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.125
FOR ME,
WALKING AWAY WAS

35:54.166 --> 35:56.500
THE... MOST AWFUL THING
IN MY LIFE.

35:56.542 --> 35:59.834
BUT I-I MADE A CHOICE...

35:59.875 --> 36:04.834
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS
IN MY CHILD'S BEST INTEREST.

36:04.875 --> 36:08.208
I WAS JUST...

36:08.250 --> 36:11.625
TOO DAMAGED TO DO ANYTHING
BUT HURT LUCAS.

36:11.667 --> 36:15.041
SO I WALKED AWAY...

36:15.083 --> 36:21.417
NOT TO AVOID HIM
OR TO...

36:21.458 --> 36:23.417
(voice breaking)
CONTROL HIM,

36:23.458 --> 36:26.041
BUT TO SAVE HIM.

36:26.083 --> 36:29.041
BUT, NAI, YOU JUST...

36:29.083 --> 36:31.041
(normal voice)
YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.041
SO YOU WANT TO WALK AWAY

36:33.083 --> 36:36.875
TO AVOID FIGURING OUT
WHAT COMES NEXT.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.041
I DIDN'T GET MY WAY.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.125
YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.375
(voice breaks)
I DIDN'T GET MY WAY.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.041
(sighs)

36:49.083 --> 36:51.458
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

36:51.500 --> 36:53.458
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.458
(chuckles) IF I HAD THE ANSWER
ON HOW TO BE A MOTHER,

36:56.500 --> 36:59.000
I'D BE DOING IT MYSELF.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.709
(elevator bell dings)

37:14.250 --> 37:17.166
IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE ELSE.

37:17.208 --> 37:19.625
YOU'RE MY SHRINK.
THOSE ARE THE RULES, RIGHT?

37:19.667 --> 37:21.625
ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT YOUR THERAPIST

37:21.667 --> 37:23.041
OR YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.

37:23.083 --> 37:27.041
AS I RECALL, WE TALKED ONCE,
JUST BRIEFLY.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.041
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ANYONE
OR NOT?

37:29.083 --> 37:31.500
WELL, UNLESS YOU
KILLED SOMEONE, I...

37:31.542 --> 37:33.041
(laughs)

37:33.083 --> 37:38.041
IF I CAN HELP, I'LL HELP.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.041
I DO HAVE AN OFFICE.
(bell rings)

37:40.083 --> 37:41.959
I LIKE SOMEONE... A LOT.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.250
AND MY DATING LIFE IN L.A.
HAS BEEN A LITTLE... CRAZY.

37:45.291 --> 37:46.875
IT'S BEEN AWFUL AND HARD.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.875
AND SUDDENLY I MEET SOMEONE
WHO'S EASY,

37:48.917 --> 37:50.250
AND IT'S NOT HARD WORK.

37:50.291 --> 37:52.250
AND THERE'S NOT
THAT AWKWARD DANCE

37:52.291 --> 37:53.875
OF "GETTING TO KNOW YOU."

37:53.917 --> 37:56.875
IT'S LIKE... IT'S LIKE
PICKING UP ON THE 60th DATE.

37:56.917 --> 37:58.834
IT'S LIKE WHAT I'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR

37:58.875 --> 38:01.500
HAS BEEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

38:01.542 --> 38:04.041
WELL, IT SOUNDS... PERFECT.
IT COULD BE.

38:04.083 --> 38:07.625
BUT... SEEING HIM...

38:07.667 --> 38:09.542
WOULD HURT A FRIEND.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.500
YOU CARE ABOUT THIS FRIEND?

38:12.542 --> 38:16.000
SHE'S MY CLOSEST FRIEND.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.875
AH.

38:17.917 --> 38:19.458
YES, WELL...

38:19.500 --> 38:21.667
(sighs)
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

38:21.709 --> 38:23.333
THAT'S NOT
A HELPFUL RESPONSE.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.959
WHEN SOMEONE LIKE YOU
POSES A PROBLEM LIKE THIS,

38:26.000 --> 38:27.959
I-I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT

38:28.000 --> 38:29.542
AND THAT YOU WANT IT,

38:29.583 --> 38:32.542
AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME TO
TELL YOU THAT IT'S ALL RIGHT

38:32.583 --> 38:34.667
TO DO WHAT YOU WANT.
AND IS IT?

38:34.709 --> 38:36.458
I THINK FRIENDSHIP
IS IMPORTANT.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.333
AND LORD KNOWS, THIS FRIEND,
THIS WOMAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

38:39.375 --> 38:41.375
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER

38:41.417 --> 38:43.542
BE PUT THROUGH
ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW.

38:43.583 --> 38:46.208
BUT... IF THIS
IS REALLY IT, RIGHT,

38:46.250 --> 38:48.333
THE ONE...

38:48.375 --> 38:51.834
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD WALK AWAY.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.834
