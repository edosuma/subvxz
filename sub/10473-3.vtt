Working as midwives
in London's East End,

00:36.480 --> 00:39.710
we were no strangers to first light.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.150
Or the half dark. When babies
arrived, we went to deliver them,

00:44.200 --> 00:46.150
no matter what the hour.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.630
But the Sisters rose at dawn
regardless every day.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.190
Like us, they served their patients,
but also a greater cause.

Good morning, Nonnatus House,

00:58.960 --> 01:00.470
Sister Julienne speaking.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.950
If we were committed,
they seemed invincible.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.240
But perhaps it was not always so.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.830
What about a record?

01:14.880 --> 01:18.390
Bach's Preludes and Fugues
are unsurpassed.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.910
It's Chummy's birthday!
Not her funeral!

01:20.960 --> 01:22.910
Besides, I think
she's got them already.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.550
You won't do better than

What about
a night out at the pictures?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.310
Oh, there's that wonderful thriller
I've heard about,

01:41.360 --> 01:43.270
The Thirty Nine Steps.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.800
Heard about or seen?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.670
Nurse Miller, you're at the clinic
with Sister Lee.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.790
Please have a look
at the Fletcher twins,

02:04.840 --> 02:06.910
their mother was struggling
to feed them.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.789
Nurse Franklin, you're with Sister
Winifred, and you have the...

02:09.840 --> 02:12.150
Er, everyone?
If I could have your attention?

02:12.200 --> 02:15.710
The unit who usually supply midwifery
to Holloway Women's Prison

02:15.760 --> 02:20.070
have been struck down
by an outbreak of influenza.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.150
The prison has been without care
for well over a week now,

02:23.200 --> 02:25.430
and have asked us
to take over the roster

02:25.480 --> 02:28.070
until usual service is resumed.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.910
Nurse Franklin, I would like you
to accompany me.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.310
Well, I dare say,
it will be quite fascinating

02:34.360 --> 02:36.390
to be surrounded
by hardened criminals.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.230
Most of the women who are locked up
are charged with petty theft,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.230
fraud, prostitution.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.990
But one thing's for sure,
it is no place to have a baby.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.760
And yet have them they will.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.550
Um, is this quite necessary?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.070
I'm sure the rules are in place
for a reason.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.550
You'd think WE were the criminals!
Are you the replacement midwives?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.520
We are. I'll escort you
onto the wing.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.070
INMATES: Don't forget, you owe me!
Where's the water?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.720
Get some water!

03:48.560 --> 03:52.310
Oi, Mother Superior! Yours smell
like Parma violets, do they?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.560
LAUGHTER

03:58.760 --> 04:00.990
Oh!

04:01.040 --> 04:03.070
(WHISPERING) Are you all right?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.390
Baby back in your cell, is it?

04:05.440 --> 04:08.080
Didn't your mother never tell you
it's rude to whisper?

04:15.040 --> 04:20.240
Me first. If I don't get some Milk
of Magnesia, you'll all be sorry.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.270
Stella Crangle?
Maureen Williams is the name.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.830
We shall be seeing our patients in
alphabetical order, Miss Williams.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.390
You'll have to wait your turn.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.840
Stella Crangle? Yeah.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.110
You think you're a cut above,

04:40.160 --> 04:42.790
but you dropped your drawers
for a fella same as the rest of us.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.400
Yeah, my fiance.
And I don't charge.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.790
We booked at the theatre before
we knew we were off, you see?

04:56.840 --> 04:58.910
And they're good seats, upper circle.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.270
You wouldn't be stuck in the stalls.
No thanks, mate.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.480
It's a good show.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.550
Theatre tickets, you say?

05:05.600 --> 05:09.550
I'd let them go for a snip
at this stage, say, ten bob each?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.870
OK, five, but only because
we're stuck with them.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.320
Half a crown and we're doing
business. All right!

05:20.960 --> 05:22.080
Cheers.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.190
Baby's heartbeat is excellent.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.510
She's been kicking a lot lately,
I thought maybe something was wrong.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.910
"She", is it? Just a feeling,
that's all.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.150
Well, "she's" kicking
because she wants to come out.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.390
If these dates are correct,
it makes you due any day now.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.070
Oh, the dates are right.
My fiance was home on shore leave.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.950
He's an Assistant Steward
with the Merchant Navy.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.110
I'm sorry,
your notes are rather sketchy.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.790
When did you last have a urine test?

05:55.840 --> 06:00.350
Um, last month,
when the midwives were still here.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.040
Well, it's about time you had
another one. Oh!

06:07.840 --> 06:10.360
Gosh, you're looking ahead!

06:14.640 --> 06:17.320
If you'd like to
pop behind the screen?

06:29.360 --> 06:30.910
Take a seat, Mrs Stack.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.070
Sorry, love,
take him for me, will ya?

06:33.120 --> 06:35.910
Oh, if I don't get to the lav,
I'll have an accident!

06:35.960 --> 06:39.990
There, now.
Who's got a runny nose?

06:40.040 --> 06:42.550
Kathleen Baker,
I'm a bit late, I'm afraid.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.030
I missed the bus.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.880
Just take a seat, Mrs Baker.
I'll let Sister know you're here.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.390
That's your Mrs Baker
finally arrived.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.590
Thank you, Shelagh.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.030
Getting some practice in, I see?

06:59.080 --> 07:01.480
Yes. You seem a natural.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.710
I'm simply doing my job,
Nurse Miller.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.800
This is a baby clinic after all.

07:09.200 --> 07:15.110
Ladies. I believe you're looking at
the answer to all your prayers.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.790
Nurse Noakes' birthday present.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.950
My Fair Lady,
Drury Lane, Saturday night.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.110
And a special price,
just because it's you.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.030
Oooh, Chummy loves a musical!
Never mind Chummy!

07:27.080 --> 07:30.030
Just as well I've got my contacts
then. How much?

07:30.080 --> 07:32.040
Say, ten bob each?

07:34.360 --> 07:35.400
How about five?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.430
I'd better get on with my patients.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.310
At least poor Chummy won't know
what she's missed.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.110
All right, half a crown apiece,
but you have to take all six.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.800
Final offer.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.670
It's important that you rest
from now on.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.670
No exerting yourself. Oh!

07:59.720 --> 08:01.310
June Small?

08:01.360 --> 08:04.550
Gave birth ten days ago. "Difficult
labour" is all it says here.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.600
Can you stand? Oh!
I'm ever so sore downstairs!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.310
When did you last see a midwife?

08:15.360 --> 08:19.280
Don't know. Not since they took
my baby, anyway.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.230
Well, everything's looking
ship-shape for the baby.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.590
But I can't say the same
for those varicose veins of yours.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.390
They're worse,
particularly this one.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.909
It must be very sore.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.870
Especially in the evening. Sometimes
I can't sleep for the pain.

08:41.919 --> 08:45.470
You're still wearing tight elastic
on your undergarments

08:45.520 --> 08:49.390
and I thought I told you to choose
suspenders rather than garters?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.310
You're restricting your circulation,
Mrs Baker.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.190
My Stan likes a garter.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.110
I doubt he likes the result.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.030
He said I had the prettiest pins
in Poplar.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.240
Now look at 'em!

09:03.440 --> 09:05.790
I ordered you
some support stockings.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.110
They should provide you
with considerable relief.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.550
But they're so ugly!

09:09.600 --> 09:12.590
Not half as ugly as bandages,
which is the alternative

09:12.640 --> 09:14.910
if you won't wear these.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.190
June Small should have been
seen daily.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.110
Her stitches are woefully neglected.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.390
She could have piped up
if she felt unwell.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.070
I must insist that Mrs Small
is transferred to a hospital

09:24.120 --> 09:26.030
where they have the resources
to treat her.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.990
We'll call an ambulance
from reception.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.310
And we will be coming in daily
from now on.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.190
Daily?
Twice a week's what it used to be!

09:33.240 --> 09:37.190
Well, you haven't had a midwifery
roster for some time.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.710
And Miss Crangle needs regular
visits until she delivers.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.630
You'd need to apply
direct to the Wing Governor.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.950
I can't just go round
changing the rules.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.870
WHISTLE BLOWS

09:47.920 --> 09:50.990
SHOUTING

09:51.040 --> 09:55.320
Calm down, ladies! Calm down!
Calm down! Enough!

10:03.080 --> 10:05.150
I'll telephone the Wing Governor.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.390
Surely she will appreciate the hiatus
in care that has occurred.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.950
Of course she must! In terms of
women's healthcare, we're in charge,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.230
so I wouldn't mince your words.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.550
Thank you, Nurse Franklin.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.600
Your support today has been
most appreciated.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.950
Well? How was it?

10:28.000 --> 10:32.150
Absolutely horrid.
Even Sister Julienne was rattled.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.630
And the stench!
You'll want to wash your uniform.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.470
Ugh! And my hair and my shoes!

10:38.520 --> 10:41.630
I wish I could climb into
that autoclave myself.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.390
I'll tell you what might
cheer you up.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.030
Tickets to My Fair Lady
for Chummy's birthday.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.990
And you won't believe
the deal we got.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.510
I know every word!

10:49.560 --> 10:52.110
Go on, we'll unpack your bags.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.430
Run yourself a nice hot bath
with plenty of salts.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.800
Thank you,
are you sure you don't mind?

11:00.080 --> 11:01.840
I...

11:03.280 --> 11:04.960
..G...

11:20.120 --> 11:22.910
I've soaked my uniform,
but I could happily burn it.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.590
And after only one day,
how will we bear it?

11:25.640 --> 11:30.640
The inmates must bear it,
for months or years on end.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.910
I called in to see Chummy,
she's over the moon

11:35.960 --> 11:39.350
and Mrs Torpy can sit for Freddie,
so Peter can come too.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.510
Although that does still leave
one ticket spare.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.470
What about Alec?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.590
I don't know if it's
quite his thing, but I'll ask.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.710
May we? To get us in the mood?

11:49.760 --> 11:50.950
Of course.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.790
I've lived through two World Wars
and the Blitz,

11:54.840 --> 11:58.880
but I think Julie Andrews
might just polish me off.

I thought I could send it
to The London without bothering you.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.480
But it seems I need your signature.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.550
It's a pregnancy test.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.630
Shelagh, why are you trying
to do this on your own?

13:25.680 --> 13:29.870
I had a dream for such a long time.
I know it's romantic...

13:29.920 --> 13:33.150
There is nothing wrong
with being romantic.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.590
I wanted to tell you
when I knew for certain.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.350
I wanted to see your face
when I told you the news!

13:41.400 --> 13:43.800
But you were foiled by bureaucracy?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.710
We shall pretend
that this never happened.

13:48.760 --> 13:53.790
And when you do tell me,
you just watch my face.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.360
Patrick...

13:56.600 --> 13:58.950
..I'm not sure
I'll be telling you anything.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.310
Nothing feels as it should.

14:02.360 --> 14:07.430
My cycle - or the lack of it -
suggests I might be expecting.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.070
But nothing else does.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.350
No nausea.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.230
No other symptoms at all.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.990
Not everyone feels unwell, Shelagh.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.590
You know that as well as I do.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.190
I sometimes feel
I don't know anything at all.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.510
Come on. I've done the paperwork.
You get it sent off.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.590
And then, one way or another,
we'll soon know for sure.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.240
Yes.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.120
We will.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.880
All right, love? Yeah.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.790
I'm sorry, Doctor doesn't start
surgery for another half an hour.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.190
It's my wife, she's twisted
her ankle, and you know,

14:47.240 --> 14:50.350
what with her condition, I thought
I'd drop her off on my way to work.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.120
Don't worry, I'll see you now.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.030
I should've worn the support
stockings the midwife gave me.

15:08.080 --> 15:12.200
I know that now. And those high heels
won't be helping.

15:16.640 --> 15:20.870
Oh! I can hardly walk, let alone cook
and clean, and now I've banged it!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.310
This won't do at all.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.630
For you or for baby.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.070
I'm going to book you
into the Maternity Home

15:28.120 --> 15:30.190
for the remainder of your pregnancy.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.830
But what will my husband think?

15:32.880 --> 15:36.270
He won't find me attractive no more!

15:36.320 --> 15:38.950
I don't want him to see!
I'll explain.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.070
Your blood pressure is higher
than we'd like,

15:42.120 --> 15:44.640
it's safest all round to keep you
under observation.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.470
I specifically told the officer
it was urgent,

15:49.520 --> 15:51.710
and we would be attending
this morning.

15:51.760 --> 15:57.630
Well, it's not in the log book
and you're not on the list.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.030
Nevertheless, here we are.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.230
And we must insist upon
seeing our patients.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.710
Prisoners are all on work duty,
I'll have to round 'em up.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.230
Surely Miss Crangle isn't working?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.710
I prescribed complete bed rest
from now on.

16:12.760 --> 16:17.590
Miss Crangle is to work up until
her time like everyone else.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.270
That's the rules.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.400
Well this rule,
I'm afraid, must be broken.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.430
No point in making a meal of it.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.830
Soon as it's out,
they'll have it off ya,

16:35.880 --> 16:38.110
quick as you can say "unfit mother".

16:38.160 --> 16:43.310
Well, I'm not! Well, fiance or not,
there ain't no ring on your finger.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.270
There will be. You're just jealous.
What, of a stuck-up cow like you?

16:47.320 --> 16:49.750
Give it a year,
you'll be back in this place,

16:49.800 --> 16:52.430
asking me for tricks of the trade.
Over my dead body.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.240
That can be arranged!
Look, I don't want any trouble...

16:59.200 --> 17:03.720
Fight! Fight! Fight!

17:13.800 --> 17:17.160
Break it up! Calm down, ladies!
Calm down!

17:19.040 --> 17:20.470
What on earth is going on?

17:20.520 --> 17:23.910
She started it! Banging on
about her precious fiance!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.150
That's a lie!

17:25.200 --> 17:27.790
Thinks she's Lady Muck cos she's got
a fella on the outside!

17:27.839 --> 17:30.520
Don't change the fact
she's been charged with theft!

17:32.040 --> 17:34.270
Back to you cell! Show's over!

17:34.320 --> 17:39.280
My Fair Lady? You needn't come
if it isn't manly enough for you.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.470
I'd come to a meeting of the WI
if you were going to be there.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.750
I'd better go before Mrs Goldman
finds out I'm here.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.910
It won't be like this forever,
Jenny.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.270
Soon as I've saved enough, I'll be
finding a place of my own to rent.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.840
And, maybe, you could help me look?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.430
I might, if you're lucky.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.880
I really had better go, I'll be late
for my next appointment.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.030
I can't believe
such a heavily pregnant woman

18:14.080 --> 18:15.590
is still made to work.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.750
I want the pay,
I'm saving for the baby.

18:17.800 --> 18:21.430
Hello, Stella. Sister. Nurse.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.190
Tom Hereward, I'm the Chaplain
on rotation for the month.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.430
Can I give you a hand?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.670
You could help see to it that
Miss Crangle is confined to her bed

18:28.720 --> 18:30.310
until further notice.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.190
Whatever the prison rules state,
her health is at risk,

18:34.240 --> 18:35.950
and that of her unborn baby.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.350
You hear that, Stella?
That's an order.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.390
and I won't hesitate to tell tales
if I have to.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.720
Come on, Miss Crangle,
Let's get you back to your room.

18:53.120 --> 18:56.430
Heartbeat's fine.
Baby's moving well.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.750
Everything seems to be on track.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.960
So, no harm done, thankfully.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.360
Why don't you go on ahead,
Nurse Franklin?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.150
I'm not thick, you know.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.350
It's just our orphanage kept
getting bombed out.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.910
You're certainly not alone in having
your education disrupted by the war.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.870
I've got my meeting coming up
with the Board soon.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.110
Well, they can take your baby away,
if they think you're no good.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.880
I want to prove that
I can better myself.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.550
Your desire to learn is admirable,
but,

19:37.600 --> 19:41.510
if you were to put the loop of
the P at the top, like a head

19:41.560 --> 19:46.720
rather than a foot, you'd have much
more success with the word "play".

19:49.600 --> 19:52.110
I'm not a thief, neither, Sister.
I swear.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.310
I was only borrowing a few things

19:54.360 --> 19:56.470
just to tide me over
until Joe came back.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.150
I'm not here to pass judgement.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.630
But I want you to know!
I want the Board to know!

20:00.680 --> 20:03.630
If they think I'm an unfit mother,
they'll take my baby, won't they?

20:03.680 --> 20:07.670
You've made a mistake, but
you have a fiance on the outside.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.870
But me and Joe won't actually be
married before the baby's born.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.350
Would they take her for that?

20:14.400 --> 20:18.040
I'm sure you'll find your way.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.150
How's the patient?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.110
Overtired and overdue.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.590
Your attentions are a comfort,
I'm sure.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.910
Stella isn't inclined
to ask for help herself.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.550
She asked for reassurance
about the fate of her child.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.710
But I know nothing
about prison procedure.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.150
She will have seen other mothers
lose their babies,

20:41.200 --> 20:43.550
it's only natural for her
to be fearful.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.590
But this is her first offence,
she's not a prostitute or a drunk.

20:47.640 --> 20:51.270
Like Maureen Williams,
the woman who attacked her?

20:51.320 --> 20:54.510
Maureen is very angry
with the world. And no wonder.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.070
This is the third time
she's been charged with soliciting

20:57.120 --> 20:59.910
and the second baby
she will have had removed.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.070
She's still only 24.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.190
Are you finished, Sister?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.790
For the moment. She's resting.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.280
Well, she'll have to "rest" later.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.000
Right, up you get!

21:13.120 --> 21:14.630
What is going on?

21:14.680 --> 21:17.390
She's to see the Wing Governor
about fighting in the work room.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.550
I've got terrible heartburn.
Surely this isn't necessary!

21:20.600 --> 21:24.510
I've got my orders!
Then I insist on coming too.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.680
Gently does it.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.590
I'll put these cases
in the cupboard later.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.110
Better leave the rollers out,

21:38.160 --> 21:40.990
I'll need to
fix my hair before Stan comes.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.550
I think the priority at the moment
is to get that leg of yours

21:44.600 --> 21:47.310
treated with a kaolin poultice.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.150
I'm afraid the paste does smell
a bit. Ugh!

21:50.200 --> 21:53.470
I've got varicose veins,
swollen ankles, stretch marks,

21:53.520 --> 21:56.750
and the last time I coughed too hard,
I only went and wet my drawers!

21:56.800 --> 21:59.750
Those are all perfectly normal
things during pregnancy.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.550
Me and Stan have only been
married nine months,

22:02.600 --> 22:05.230
but I don't feel that... Ow!

22:05.280 --> 22:08.350
I don't feel like the girl
he fell for anymore.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.910
I'm sure that's not the case.
I know it sounds daft,

22:12.960 --> 22:16.470
but Stan could have had his pick
of the girls and he chose me.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.710
I don't want to disappoint him.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.190
How could you
when you're having his child?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.950
I suppose it's because
I love him so much.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, I'm just terrified of losing him.
Know what I mean?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.710
Maureen Williams is a known pest,
but you, Stella?

22:33.760 --> 22:35.510
If it wasn't for your condition,

22:35.560 --> 22:37.990
you'd be on your way to the
punishment block.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.630
I will not tolerate
violence on my wing.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.670
Well, I was only defending myself.
I beg your pardon,

22:43.720 --> 22:47.070
but I was there to witness Miss
Crangle being pushed to the ground.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.350
Thank you, Sister, but you are here
in a medical capacity

22:50.400 --> 22:55.030
and do not understand prison life.
This will go on your record, Stella,

22:55.080 --> 22:59.750
and I don't need to tell you it will
reflect badly on you with the Board.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.710
The Children's Welfare Officer
certainly won't be impressed.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.670
Oh, it's not fair!
You have no family, no home.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.110
And in the absence of any word
from your fiance...

23:10.160 --> 23:12.590
Well, I'm only allowed
one letter a month!

23:12.640 --> 23:14.710
Joe was already away
when I was sentenced!

23:14.760 --> 23:16.510
If he'd have known,
he'd never have gone!

23:16.560 --> 23:19.310
Well, I can look after my baby
until he gets back.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.760
I've been saving my pay.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.040
Six shillings and four pence.
How far will that get you?

23:29.960 --> 23:32.950
Why won't anyone help me?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.190
Why won't you help me?

23:35.240 --> 23:39.240
I'm afraid I must insist on
taking my patient back to her bed.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.230
Why don't I take it
straight to the clinic

23:45.280 --> 23:47.710
and let Nurse Miller sort out
what's worth keeping?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.950
Everything has to be taken
to the dining room

23:50.000 --> 23:52.870
for my personal inspection.

23:52.920 --> 23:56.800
Nurse Miller might overlook
something priceless.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.310
She feels betrayed, and no wonder.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.630
For all intents and purposes,
she's alone in this world.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.510
In which case,
don't we, of all people,

24:14.560 --> 24:17.510
have a responsibility to her?

24:17.560 --> 24:22.350
Sister, you've said it to us all
in the past. We can't save everyone.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.830
But she isn't "everyone".

24:24.880 --> 24:28.520
She is one young woman,
desperate to keep her child.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.230
It's nearly time
for Compline, Sister.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.110
I must finish evaluating
these donated volumes.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.870
Or I risk sending
inappropriate material

24:46.920 --> 24:49.110
to the young in our community.

24:49.160 --> 24:53.670
And filling our own archives
with fairytales.

24:53.720 --> 24:59.590
Although, many a fairy tale provides
insight into the darker aspects

24:59.640 --> 25:03.230
of our existence on this earth.
And the lighter.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.070
Hook is a monster!

25:05.120 --> 25:09.710
But he is defeated by Peter,
the dreamer and eternal child.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.230
Perhaps we should keep it
at Nonnatus House

25:12.280 --> 25:14.430
for our own spiritual nourishment.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.590
Don't we have plenty to nourish our
spirits within these walls, Sister?

25:18.640 --> 25:22.000
I think we should let it
enrich someone else's soul.

25:57.160 --> 26:01.350
Patrick. I think
the test results are in.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.990
Do you want to open it?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.240
No.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.200
Negative.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.200
A negative THIS time.

26:25.880 --> 26:31.790
There's something wrong. It's been
three months since my last cycle.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.870
Three months with NOTHING?
Are you sure?

26:35.920 --> 26:38.360
I marked it in my diary.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.870
And things were erratic before then.

26:42.920 --> 26:47.110
Starting when?
When I was in the sanatorium.

26:47.160 --> 26:52.430
TB is a serious illness.
It does change things.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.280
Doesn't it?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.360
Leave this with me.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.880
KATHLEEN SCREAMS

27:12.920 --> 27:14.870
Here's another one, Kathleen.

27:14.920 --> 27:17.710
I can't. Yes, you can. Here.

27:17.760 --> 27:21.000
Nice deep breaths for me.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.390
Right, are you ready?
Can you feel it coming?

27:31.440 --> 27:33.270
Good! Good.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.990
Push! Push for me!
Good girl, that's it!

27:37.040 --> 27:40.390
Keep that going, good...

27:40.440 --> 27:43.550
Good. That's it, Kathleen, good.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.200
You're doing famously.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.950
Yes, of course, thank you. Bye.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.840
Shelagh?

27:56.920 --> 27:59.790
Did I ever mention
my friend Ted Horringer to you?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.790
Is he a gynaecologist? Yes.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.190
He spent time in New York,
but now he's back

28:04.240 --> 28:07.750
and practising in Harley Street.
Harley Street?

28:07.800 --> 28:11.670
He can do an exploratory operation
that isn't available at the London.

28:11.720 --> 28:15.680
He says he'll see you,
if that's what you want.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.550
I want to know, Patrick.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.270
I want to know
if there's something wrong,

28:21.320 --> 28:23.070
and if there is, to make it right.

28:23.120 --> 28:27.510
So do I. Nobody ever lost anything
by looking for the answers.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.070
No.
KNOCK AT DOOR

28:30.120 --> 28:32.110
Doctor, would you mind
checking Mrs Baker?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.630
The baby's big, and she's been
struggling for a while.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.160
I'll fetch your gown.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.510
This should settle your stomach.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.590
I'm starting to think that she just
wants to stay put where she's safe.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.630
And who can blame her?

28:46.680 --> 28:49.870
It must be very lonely for you,
with all this happening

28:49.920 --> 28:51.720
and your fiance away.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.030
He'll be back.
But you don't know when?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.760
I only wish I did.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.590
I've been thinking about
your troubles, my dear,

29:01.640 --> 29:04.030
and I'd like very much like
to help you,

29:04.080 --> 29:06.390
to improve your chances
at the Board meeting.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.150
I think you've probably mastered
Dick and Dora, now.

29:10.200 --> 29:15.830
And this is a jolly good story, as
well as being a more advanced read.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.320
I can help you with it.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.990
I rang for permission,
before bringing it in.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.190
It's yours to keep.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.360
One day, God willing,
you shall read it to your child.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.950
KATHLEEN SCREAMS

29:34.000 --> 29:36.310
There was some slight deflection

29:36.360 --> 29:38.640
that corrected with
the last contraction.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.520
There's another contraction coming,
Kathleen.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.080
Are you ready?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.560
KATHLEEN SCREAMS

29:53.960 --> 29:57.510
Perineum is buttonholing.
You were right, Sister Lee.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.920
Baby is very big.

30:00.680 --> 30:05.680
Pant, now, Mrs Baker. I'm just going
to help baby on its way.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.750
SHE SCREAMS

30:09.800 --> 30:14.150
Is that my Kathleen? It sounds like
she's being torn limb from limb.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.950
I know you're worried,
but it's all part of childbirth.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.870
You're telling me that's normal?

30:18.920 --> 30:21.560
It's the most natural thing
that could be.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.240
Jesus wept!

30:31.400 --> 30:35.110
BABY CRIES

30:35.160 --> 30:38.510
Doctor will call you
when your wife's ready.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.350
I'll fetch you a cup of tea.

30:40.400 --> 30:44.640
And, Mr Baker, congratulations.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.120
Yes!

30:57.080 --> 30:58.880
It's a girl, Stan.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.920
My girl!

31:04.360 --> 31:06.190
I must look a fright.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.720
No, you look fine, love.
You did brilliant.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.960
I'm going to be sick.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.800
I'll go back to the house
and get her some things.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.910
♪ I could have danced all night... ♪

31:24.960 --> 31:29.960
Campari, meet Jenny and Cynthia!
Jenny and Cynthia, meet Campari!

31:33.400 --> 31:35.230
Oh, it's horrible!

31:35.280 --> 31:37.790
Hmm. You both have such
conservative palates!

31:37.840 --> 31:39.750
I think it's perfectly delicious.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.310
I thought you were on call
when we get back? I can have one.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.830
What-ho? Room for one more?
Hello, birthday girl!

31:46.880 --> 31:48.630
Chummy! Oh, many happy returns!

31:48.680 --> 31:51.590
Happy birthday! I thought
we were meeting you there?

31:51.640 --> 31:54.470
Peter was an absolute dear,
and secretly asked Mrs Torpy

31:54.520 --> 31:55.910
if she'd come early!

31:55.960 --> 31:58.870
He knows it's the getting-ready part
I've missed the most.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.600
Clearly. Take a seat, please.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.870
You need volume.
Volume at the roots.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.830
If one can lift the hair,
it takes the whole face with it.

32:08.880 --> 32:13.030
Trixie, leave her alone!
You look as lovely as ever, Chummy.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.670
I've always envied your complexion.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.960
Campari?
You might have to hold your nose.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.430
Ooh! Right, look at me.
Cynthia's quite right, of course.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.830
Your skin is positively peach-like.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.760
But no girl should neglect herself,
or the bloom will go!

32:33.720 --> 32:38.390
I've only ever been on nodding terms
with one's inner glamourpuss.

32:38.440 --> 32:42.310
And trying to apply lipstick whilst
changing Young Sir's napkin

32:42.360 --> 32:44.110
has been known to backfire horribly!

32:44.160 --> 32:48.870
And don't go smirking at me,
Nurse Lee! It'll be you next.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.550
We've all seen the way Alec looks
at you. Absolutely we have.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.950
It's rather like
the way Fred Astaire

32:55.000 --> 32:57.110
looks at Audrey Hepburn
in Funny Face.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.750
Alec can look at me
any way he likes!

32:58.800 --> 33:01.190
It doesn't mean I'll be
manhandled down the aisle.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.750
You say manhandled
as though it's a bad thing!

33:03.800 --> 33:06.670
Alec and I are entirely
happy as we are!

33:06.720 --> 33:09.470
If there's any change of plan,
I'll see you're informed

33:09.520 --> 33:12.920
in a timely manner. Now, I'd be very
grateful if you'd pass the nuts.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.470
I've eaten them all.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.910
I was trying to help
the Campari to go down.

33:17.960 --> 33:22.270
Fear not! I tried my hand
at making Cheddar straws.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.590
Every single attempt
ended in complete disaster.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.110
So I popped to the corner shop
and got a box of Twiglets.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.470
Ooh!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.440
Happy birthday, Chummy.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.230
Cheers! Cheers!

33:35.280 --> 33:36.520
Cheers!

33:42.960 --> 33:45.200
What do they actually do
up there for so long?

33:46.200 --> 33:49.870
Mysterious, fragrant things
that can't be rushed.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.720
I just put a suit on.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.590
Maybe you should have given it
the once-over first.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.790
Oh, no!
I've just had this dry-cleaned!

33:59.840 --> 34:01.750
Did your hand slip
with the Brylcreem?

34:01.800 --> 34:04.070
It's probably something
to do with Freddie.

34:04.120 --> 34:08.350
There's this thing with babies.
There's a sort of...slime that
comes out of them.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.590
And never just out of places
you expect.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.440
He's just had a cold.
I think this might be nasal.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.270
Fun, though.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.840
Having a kid? Yes.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.320
Most fun I've ever had.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.070
Anyway, you'll do.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.510
Thanks. Do you want Camilla
to wash that for you?

34:28.560 --> 34:33.000
No, no, no, no. I might need it,
in case I cry at My Fair Lady.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.320
Goodness me!
Aren't we the lucky fellas?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.480
Yes. We certainly are.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.590
I'm never sure about wine gums.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.710
I always feel as though they've got
stuck in my chest, halfway down.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.430
Have a choc-ice instead.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.910
Why don't we have wine gums now,
and a choc-ice in the interval?

36:01.960 --> 36:05.630
It would seem rather improper
to have a choc-ice
before the show's even started!

36:05.680 --> 36:07.390
It's your birthday, Chummy!

36:07.440 --> 36:10.710
You can a have a choc-ice before,
during and after if you want to!

36:10.760 --> 36:12.590
Can't she, Trixie?

36:12.640 --> 36:15.680
She can do whatever she likes.
We all can.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.150
How much have we got?

36:19.200 --> 36:22.470
I say, old thing.
You look a wee bit peely-wally.

36:22.520 --> 36:26.150
Is everything all right? I'm sorry.
I should've had another Campari.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.230
It's spending all day
in that beastly prison.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.150
And the thought of being
on call tonight.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.550
I'm almost looking forward to that!

36:32.600 --> 36:35.830
If I get called out, it will be
to a home, where - however mean

36:35.880 --> 36:40.590
and shabby it is - I'll deliver
a baby that's been born of love,

36:40.640 --> 36:43.030
and has some
sort of a chance in life.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.830
Trixie, you know
this job as well as I do.

36:46.880 --> 36:51.830
We see heartbreak all the time,
but we can't afford to dwell on it.

36:51.880 --> 36:55.870
We must keep forging on, giving
our best to each case as it comes.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.070
I know. You're quite right.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.520
That's the girl.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.350
Very well, ladies!

37:04.400 --> 37:07.150
What's the verdict on the wine gums,
or is the jury still out?

37:07.200 --> 37:08.950
Actually, we worked out that

37:09.000 --> 37:11.710
if we pooled our resources we had
enough for a box of chocolates!

37:11.760 --> 37:14.190
Mmm! Perfect!
How much do I owe you?

37:14.240 --> 37:18.830
Ladies, I'm terribly sorry, but
it seems there's been a bit of...

37:18.880 --> 37:22.280
A misunderstanding.
And that's putting it politely.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.830
Oh, it's bally rotten luck.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.910
And we so rarely get an evening pass
away from Young Sir.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.630
Poor Fred getting duped like that.

37:32.680 --> 37:37.590
Poor Fred? We paid good money for
those tickets. And Fred didn't have
to stand there like a fool

37:37.640 --> 37:41.030
as the box office practically
accused him of counterfeiting.
And me a policeman!

37:41.080 --> 37:43.070
I should have known -
the paper was too thin.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.590
Well, hindsight's no use to us
right now.

37:45.640 --> 37:49.230
Well, the night is still young.
As my ayah used to say,

37:49.280 --> 37:51.990
"Bahaar jaake mazza karro".

37:52.040 --> 37:53.910
Which roughly translated, means

37:53.960 --> 37:56.550
"One can always make one's own
entertainment."

37:56.600 --> 37:59.630
I know what would entertain me
right now. A pint of bitter.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.310
Mm! And a game of darts?

38:01.360 --> 38:03.990
Yeah! Ooh, we could form teams
and play for stakes.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.870
We'll pair off. Jenny and me,
you two, and the Noakes.

38:06.920 --> 38:10.110
GIRLS GIGGLE

38:10.160 --> 38:11.310
Hard luck, old bean.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.080
I think we'll hold our own.

38:21.720 --> 38:22.710
78.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.670
A bit rusty, I'm afraid.
Should have got the triple.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.910
Chummy, you're a wonder!

38:27.960 --> 38:29.350
Dark horse, more like.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.710
We had a rec hall at the mission
in Sierra Leone.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.310
I rather got the hang of it.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.350
I'll say. All bets off.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.350
We've been hoodwinked
for the second time tonight.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.080
Not so fast, mister.
I could be your secret weapon.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.710
Steady on!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.390
I think the secret's out.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.990
Do you want to swap partners?
Too late!

38:53.040 --> 38:56.400
Ah, I wouldn't be so fickle anyway.
I'm a stayer, me.

39:00.680 --> 39:01.720
Ooh!

39:03.520 --> 39:06.430
To be honest, I'd have rather spent
the evening playing darts anyway.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.870
You should have said no
in the first place, then.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.480
And miss an evening out
with the woman I love?

39:18.800 --> 39:21.960
Is that OK to say?
That I love you?

39:25.880 --> 39:28.920
Thank you. I'd better go.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.670
You're back early. Don't ask.
Stella Crangle's waters have broken.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.390
She's been moved to the prison's
own hospital wing.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.830
Just let me get changed.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.760
I'll put the kettle...on.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.270
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:05.320 --> 40:07.440
Cocoa? How did you know?

40:09.120 --> 40:11.760
What happened? Did you and Alec row?

40:13.320 --> 40:15.320
No. Not really.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.480
He said he loves me.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.160
But that's wonderful! Isn't it?

40:24.520 --> 40:26.750
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel about it.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.590
But you have such fun together.
I thought you were really keen.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.350
So did I.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.990
But I'm young. I don't want to get
married and have children yet.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.390
He didn't propose!

40:38.440 --> 40:41.390
No. He's not likely to now.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.160
What did you say?

40:44.360 --> 40:48.310
Nothing.
I just pretended he hadn't said it.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.310
Oh! Well...

40:51.360 --> 40:55.630
I'm hardly an expert when it comes
to men, but I'm fairly sure

40:55.680 --> 40:59.320
that chocolate usually takes
the edge off when things go wrong.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.000
Thank you.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.230
We're here, Stella.
There's nothing to worry about.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.480
Crowning. The baby's coming, Stella.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.990
They left it very late to call us.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.270
Well done, Stella -
we can see baby's head.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.510
Now it's very important
that you don't push.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.910
You're a very brave girl, Stella.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.310
That's it, keep on panting.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.030
Well done. That's it!

41:28.080 --> 41:30.800
That's it! The head's out.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.640
Now we need one last push, Stella!

41:40.000 --> 41:41.040
That's it!

41:43.200 --> 41:47.070
Here she comes!
BABY CRIES

41:47.120 --> 41:49.070
Except it's a boy!

41:49.120 --> 41:51.350
It's a boy?

41:51.400 --> 41:53.750
Yes. I've got a boy?

41:53.800 --> 41:55.400
Well done!

41:58.200 --> 42:01.360
BABY CRIES

42:33.920 --> 42:35.440
Hello!

42:40.680 --> 42:41.920
Hello.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.390
SHE YAWNS

43:03.440 --> 43:04.630
Long night?

43:04.680 --> 43:08.470
Sister Evangelina was right.
Prison's no place to have a baby.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.830
Not that the little one knew,
thank goodness.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.280
There's toast warming for you.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.320
Come on! In you come.

43:17.880 --> 43:23.550
Er, about My Fair Lady. Sister
Evangelina told me what happened.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.390
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.110
If a thing looks too good to be
true, then likely it is.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.750
We want our money back, Fred.

43:29.800 --> 43:33.590
Yes, er, the thing is,
you might have to wait a while.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.790
Ugh! He's spent it.
I will reimburse you.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.670
You and your schemes, honestly!

43:38.720 --> 43:40.710
Hang on a minute! Scheme or no,

43:40.760 --> 43:43.350
you were just as keen to get
your hands on a bargain as anyone.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.990
I should have just given them
to you girls in the first place.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.790
You should have stayed away from
nefarious personages on the dock,
Fred Buckle.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.350
I suggest you all just
put it down to experience.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.070
Is Sister Julienne in her office?

43:54.120 --> 43:57.560
She's gone back
to the Women's prison. Already?

44:02.480 --> 44:04.390
Oh, no!

44:04.440 --> 44:09.000
Just hold him like this,
and offer him the breast. There.

44:11.760 --> 44:15.400
Ah, there! What a good boy you have.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.150
They say I'm allowed a character
witness at my hearing tomorrow.

44:24.200 --> 44:27.230
I was hoping that you might
agree to vouch for me.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.360
I'd like to help in any way I can.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.160
I'm going to name him Peter.
Like in the book you gave me.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.720
Cos he's my magic boy.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.270
Not Joe, after his father?

44:43.320 --> 44:45.950
Peter Joseph.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.390
Is Joseph his given name? Only
I've been trying to track him down,

44:49.440 --> 44:52.190
and I can't find any record
of a Joe or a Joseph Dixon.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.480
If I had the correct information,
I might be able to er...

44:57.560 --> 44:59.120
Oh, no!

45:00.120 --> 45:01.160
Please!

45:03.560 --> 45:06.400
I can't help you
if you don't tell me the truth.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.880
You can run, but you cannot hide.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.680
Oh, an egg!

45:24.280 --> 45:26.910
Oh! I've got nits!

45:26.960 --> 45:30.310
Well, technically, so far, you've
got one louse and its unborn child

45:30.360 --> 45:32.790
but the day is still young.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.790
Ugh, that ghastly prison!

45:35.840 --> 45:38.310
From now on, I'm wearing a wimple
when I go in.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.960
I'll fetch you some olive oil
and a shower cap.

45:43.200 --> 45:46.630
Unless you'd prefer it
if I shaved your head completely?

45:46.680 --> 45:47.720
Ugh!

45:51.640 --> 45:54.390
I didn't want to lie -
I didn't know what else to do.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.230
Did you not think
they would find out?

45:56.280 --> 46:00.070
Well, I thought
if I could prove myself respectable
before I was released,

46:00.120 --> 46:03.870
they might help me get
my old lodgings back. Or put me
in one of those homes,

46:03.920 --> 46:06.270
just until I found a job
and a place of my own.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.470
With a newborn baby
and a criminal record?

46:08.520 --> 46:09.560
Please, Sister!

46:11.240 --> 46:14.550
Don't tell them, please.
They already think I'm trouble.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.440
I'm sorry, I can't lie for you,
Stella.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.430
KNOCK ON DOOR

46:23.480 --> 46:29.550
I believe her motives for lying were
honourable. She's desperate.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.670
She is also a hair's breadth away

46:31.720 --> 46:34.870
from being guilty of a further
criminal offence.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.720
I was about to register her baby's
birth with false information.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.710
To do so, knowingly, is illegal.

46:42.760 --> 46:47.240
At least Miss Crangle has made
things simple for the hearing.

46:49.920 --> 46:51.720
I'll find you a vase.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.110
She's a belter, isn't she?

47:00.160 --> 47:03.520
I thought maybe we could call her
Eleanor. After your mum.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.110
Ow!

47:07.160 --> 47:11.350
Sorry, love! Sorry. No, no, I'm
sorry. I had to have a few stitches.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.320
You don't want to know about that.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.030
I just can't stand it,
that's all, you know.

47:17.080 --> 47:19.270
I'll be back on my feet
before you know it.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.480
And I'll get my figure back,
I promise.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.550
You'll have bed rest
like the midwife says,

47:25.600 --> 47:29.070
and you'll let me take care of you
for once. But I thought...

47:29.120 --> 47:31.440
No, yesterday, when I saw you
lying there...

47:32.880 --> 47:34.600
..what you'd been through...

47:36.400 --> 47:40.550
..it made me feel totally helpless,
like I'd let you down.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.480
So what did I do? I just ran off
like a proper coward.

47:45.920 --> 47:50.800
I'll never let you down again,
Kathleen. Not you, nor our daughter.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.710
I love you, Stanley Baker.

47:56.760 --> 48:01.520
And I reckon I must be
the luckiest woman in the world.

48:05.760 --> 48:08.430
Oh, no! Flat tyre?

48:08.480 --> 48:12.990
I'm afraid so.
I had to walk most of the way home.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.750
You all right, Sister?

48:14.800 --> 48:17.510
I confess that at times,

48:17.560 --> 48:20.920
the suffering of others
is hard to bear, Fred.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.470
She has no hope of a place
in a single mother's home, now.

48:31.520 --> 48:36.120
Her baby will be taken, and
most likely end up in an orphanage.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.750
I suppose she was only doing
what she had to,

48:39.800 --> 48:41.470
to keep hold of the nipper.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.720
I don't doubt that.
I just couldn't collude in a lie.

48:48.160 --> 48:51.510
I know I would have done anything
to have looked after my girls

48:51.560 --> 48:53.230
when their mother was killed.

48:53.280 --> 48:56.800
I even considered
deserting the army for a bit.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.310
I thought my heart would break
from worrying about them.

49:02.360 --> 49:06.990
Two years it was, they was
shunted from relative to relative.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.640
But...

49:10.120 --> 49:13.110
..I suppose I was lucky
to have any help at all.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.470
Stella Crangle has no-one, now.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.480
You did your best, Sister.
Have I, though?

49:38.400 --> 49:41.110
You'll all have to get checked,
I'm afraid.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.990
And I'll wash your bedding
with mine, just in case.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.230
Here, I'll help you.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.870
But it's your evening off.

49:48.920 --> 49:50.310
I'm not doing anything else.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.630
I don't know what's wrong with you,
Jenny Lee.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.990
You could be out with a perfectly
charming dish of a man,

49:56.040 --> 49:59.310
and you'd rather boil the nits
out of bed sheets.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.560
But just for now, I'm glad of it.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.070
But your colleague did say there was
a position open in the canteen.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.630
KNOCK ON DOOR

50:07.680 --> 50:11.950
I understand,
but I have had a long association

50:12.000 --> 50:15.150
with your organisation,
and I would personally guarantee...

50:15.200 --> 50:17.510
LINE GOES DEAD

50:17.560 --> 50:18.550
No luck?

50:18.600 --> 50:22.270
It's bad enough when they know
Stella has an illegitimate child.

50:22.320 --> 50:25.510
When I tell them
she'll have a criminal record,
they stop listening.

50:25.560 --> 50:28.070
So much for human charity
and forgiveness.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.910
Well, I for one am not giving up
until I have to.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.110
Hello, stranger.

50:33.160 --> 50:34.920
Alec!

50:37.280 --> 50:38.910
Sorry, I've got to get on.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.550
Sure. Just so long
as you're not avoiding me.

50:42.600 --> 50:46.350
Course not! Just been busy.

50:46.400 --> 50:50.390
Look, if it's about what I said
the other night - scratch it.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.270
How I feel should be a nice thing

50:52.320 --> 50:55.320
but if it's made you feel
uncomfortable, let's start again.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.600
Jenny Lee - I really,
really like you.

51:03.560 --> 51:07.550
I really, really like you too,
Alec Jesmond.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.520
Well, that's fine, then.

51:12.880 --> 51:16.870
How would you like to go
to the theatre on Saturday night?

51:16.920 --> 51:19.390
My Fair Lady, front circle.

51:19.440 --> 51:23.710
You're joking! And this time
the tickets are squeaky clean.

51:23.760 --> 51:27.120
Just don't tell the others,
or we'll have a riot on our hands!

51:31.640 --> 51:34.750
I won't even be leaving
the building.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.430
Ted has offered me his sitting room,

51:37.480 --> 51:39.750
and 50-odd back copies
of The Lancet.

51:39.800 --> 51:44.430
Patrick, I'll be under anaesthesia!
And you have patients to attend to.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.390
I am not leaving you alone.

51:46.440 --> 51:49.160
I'm never alone. I'm married to you.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.840
Miss Crangle has stated her case.

51:56.840 --> 52:00.710
But we are not here to ascertain
whether or not she wishes to care

52:00.760 --> 52:03.910
for her baby on her release
but whether or not she is able.

52:03.960 --> 52:07.230
And since it transpires
that the fiance turns out to be

52:07.280 --> 52:09.150
a figment of her imagination...

52:09.200 --> 52:11.230
A wilful lie, Mr Russell.

52:11.280 --> 52:15.190
One that was exposed by her own
character witness who has failed

52:15.240 --> 52:16.910
to appear at this hearing.

52:16.960 --> 52:20.200
Yes. Well, I fear we have no choice.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.270
Officer, would you take the prisoner
back to her cell

52:24.320 --> 52:26.120
whilst we review our decision?

52:30.880 --> 52:33.670
Miss Crangle is due for release
in a fortnight.

52:33.720 --> 52:36.590
Perhaps it is best if we take
custody of the baby immediately.

52:36.640 --> 52:37.920
Give her time to recover.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.800
Stella?

52:49.080 --> 52:50.070
Sorry.

52:50.120 --> 52:53.070
I'm sorry I'm late. There was an
urgent telephone call I had to make.

52:53.120 --> 52:56.750
Er, this is Sister Julienne,
Stella Crangle's midwife

52:56.800 --> 52:58.710
and character witness.

52:58.760 --> 53:02.510
I'm afraid you've had a wasted
journey. The decision has been made.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.830
We must consider the best
interest of the child.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.270
I am convinced the interests
of the child are best-served

53:07.320 --> 53:08.910
by endeavouring to help
Miss Crangle.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.990
I realise you have developed
something of a bond with the
prisoner.

53:12.040 --> 53:15.510
Throughout my career I have had
to help facilitate the painful

53:15.560 --> 53:17.670
separation of mother and child.

53:17.720 --> 53:21.200
I do not come from a position
of ignorance or sentimentality.

53:22.960 --> 53:26.230
I have rarely met a young woman
more determined,

53:26.280 --> 53:29.030
though life has given her
so little in return.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.670
We have precious few places
in funded homes, Sister,

53:31.720 --> 53:34.270
and there are more worthy
candidates.

53:34.320 --> 53:39.950
I have found her a place
at the Mother's Hospital in Hackney.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.710
Not as a patient, of course
but as a cleaner - with board

53:42.760 --> 53:47.840
and lodgings, and on-site nursery
facilities for her baby.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.350
Are they aware of
her criminal record?

53:51.400 --> 53:55.390
Indeed. But they know me
and trust my word.

53:55.440 --> 54:01.040
They are ready to receive her upon
her release, should you agree.

54:09.720 --> 54:11.000
That's my girl.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.630
Is it over?

54:14.680 --> 54:17.150
All done.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.470
Ah! No sitting up, Matron's orders.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.200
And I'm telling you,
she's an absolute Tartar.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.750
Did you see Mr Horringer?

54:26.800 --> 54:29.200
Have a bit more sleep.
We can talk later.

54:30.440 --> 54:32.030
Now.

54:32.080 --> 54:36.990
There is scar tissue
throughout the pelvic organs.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.360
It seems the TB wasn't
just in your lungs.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.760
Is he sure?

54:46.840 --> 54:48.910
There will be a tissue biopsy.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.750
But all that can do is prove it.

54:51.800 --> 54:55.120
I know there's no hope.
You don't need to tell me.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.230
I'm sorry.

55:01.280 --> 55:04.030
Don't say that.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.990
So many dreams came true.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.920
Just not all of them.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.160
DOOR OPENS

55:25.760 --> 55:28.150
You can't have him.
Come now, Miss Crangle.

55:28.200 --> 55:33.270
Get away from my baby! Stella...
You're a lucky woman, Miss Crangle.

55:33.320 --> 55:36.040
Sister Julienne
has found you a home.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.960
You and Peter can stay together.

55:50.520 --> 55:52.790
Sorry to bother you.
We booked at the theatre

55:52.840 --> 55:56.270
before my Uncle George passed,
you see. Good seats! Upper circle.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.710
There's been a bereavement
in our family. I wonder
if you could help us?

55:59.760 --> 56:02.790
Got some theatre tickets. We have
theatre tickets. Dress circle.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.510
Excuse me, sorry to trouble you.
There's been a bereavement...

56:05.560 --> 56:06.830
Good seats. Dress circle.
