WEBVTT

01:40.226 --> 01:42.520
Five more seconds.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.522
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.941
Oh, this is such a good video.

01:47.025 --> 01:49.277
Are you thinking about doing it?
We could do it together.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.237
Mmm...

01:51.320 --> 01:53.823
No. It looks too tiring.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.826
It is. It is very tiring when you...
when you do it.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.494
Up, round, hey!

01:58.995 --> 02:01.039
I will masturbate to this, though.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.123
For sure.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.489
You know, when I was a kid,

02:35.573 --> 02:37.491
I learned about sex
during the AIDS crisis, you know?

02:37.575 --> 02:39.327
So sex seemed,
like, really scary.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.205
And then when I was a teenager, you know,
like, the president

02:42.288 --> 02:45.291
-got in trouble for, like, a blowjob...
-Jesus, dude, get a fucking grip.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.375
...shameful thing.

02:46.459 --> 02:49.128
And then by the time I got to college,
there was Internet porn,

02:49.212 --> 02:51.422
so sex didn't even seem necessary.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.634
What do you mean when
you say Natalie liked you the most?

02:55.719 --> 02:58.637
I think it comes down
to, like, five categories.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.600
Morning, Clay.

03:21.828 --> 03:23.537
--Okay. Jesus!

03:31.880 --> 03:33.214
Fuck!

03:33.297 --> 03:35.133
What the fuck were you doing?

03:35.216 --> 03:38.052
Sorry. I was texting.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.929
Texting?
You're not supposed to be texting!

03:40.013 --> 03:42.390
I know. I'm sorry.
I was stopped, and then that asshole,

03:42.473 --> 03:44.726
he honked and I panicked,
and I just...

03:44.809 --> 03:47.520
I don't have time for this shit.
You could've killed someone.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.313
Shit! Fuck! I know.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.399
I'm gonna stop doing it.
I'm sorry. I'm really--

03:51.482 --> 03:53.359
You know what?
Let's take a look at the damage.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.944
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

03:56.529 --> 03:57.696
What the fuck?

03:58.948 --> 04:01.075
Uh, I don't think there's any damage.
We're good!

04:01.159 --> 04:02.994
-Have a good day, thank you.
-Hey! What the fuck?

04:28.937 --> 04:30.479
Yeah...

04:30.563 --> 04:32.899
Oh, yeah.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.193
- Funny, right?
- Yeah, it's hilarious.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.362
- Ow. Ouch.
- Uh, are you okay?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.573
Well, should we get to class?
Should we start it up?

04:40.656 --> 04:43.409
One more, one more.
Look at this dog. Oh, my God.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.954
Oh, yeah,
that's real funny.

04:46.037 --> 04:49.958
Okay. All right, well,
should we start class?

04:50.041 --> 04:51.250
One more?

04:51.334 --> 04:55.629
Oh, okay. We'll do one more,
and then... then class, okay?

04:55.713 --> 04:56.840
What, what?

04:56.923 --> 04:59.092
- Uh, that's a goat.
- What, what? What?

05:00.426 --> 05:02.136
- What?
- What?

05:02.220 --> 05:03.221
Okay, one more, one more.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.890
Oh, uh, Arya, there's, like,
40 of these, okay?

05:05.974 --> 05:08.977
- So we should probably...
- get to studying.

05:09.727 --> 05:12.021
Let's do it.
Let's get you ready for, uh...

05:12.981 --> 05:15.774
let's get you ready for these ERBs.

05:15.859 --> 05:16.943
What's that?

05:17.026 --> 05:19.528
Arya, come on, we've talked about this
for, like, two weeks.

05:19.612 --> 05:23.074
The ERBs...
state exam you have to pass today.

05:23.157 --> 05:26.494
Just give me a minute.
I've been working all morning, I'm tired.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.162
Totally get that.
That's awesome.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.663
It's just, um...

05:29.747 --> 05:31.916
I think they're gonna call you to set
in, like, 45 minutes.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.709
Can you take a picture for my Instagram?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.171
Um...

05:37.255 --> 05:38.589
Okay.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.757
We'll do that real quick.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.842
We'll take a photo,
and we'll jump into class.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.095
Okay. Here we go.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.846
Let's see, here.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.682
Take two. One for my private
and one for my public.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.934
Oh, you have two?

05:50.018 --> 05:51.560
-Mmm-hmm.
-Baller.

05:51.644 --> 05:52.811
Big time.

05:52.896 --> 05:54.230
Do you even know what that means?

05:54.313 --> 05:56.649
Baller? No. I have no clue.

05:57.483 --> 06:01.070
--Okay. Okay, one, here we go. That's one.

06:01.154 --> 06:02.989
And, um...

06:03.072 --> 06:04.865
Wait, do you wanna get the hair
out of your face?

06:05.741 --> 06:08.452
-Why? It's on purpose.
-It is?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.746
Yes, my hair looks better
than my face today.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.917
Okay. So you...
All right. Sure.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.001
- Okay.

06:15.084 --> 06:19.338
That was a great picture
of your head covered in hair.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.965
Beautiful. All right.

06:21.049 --> 06:23.426
Oh! Have you seen my dance
for my dance class?

06:23.509 --> 06:25.261
Real quick. Sit down.

06:25.344 --> 06:26.762
Okay.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.932
All right, Arya,
just make it fast.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.059
-Okay, ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.784
All right, Arya.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.336
Hey, Arya, how long is this?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.796
Can you please not interrupt me?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.341
Now I have to start over again.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.093
-From the top?
-Yes.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.385
You can't just start from where you were?

07:06.469 --> 07:09.263
Your job isn't that hard.
Just watch me do the dance.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.598
-Okay.
-It's not that hard.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.682
Okay.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.205
No, I don't want the witches
to turn invisible.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.707
Who the fuck decided
they had that power?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.335
You can't just make up new powers
without checking with me.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.670
- Yeah, I didn't... I was not into that.

07:41.754 --> 07:44.840
Uh, yeah. Can I just say, though,
that what I like about invisibility

07:44.923 --> 07:48.261
is that, it just...
it seems like a strong metaphor

07:48.344 --> 07:53.891
because women in the 1950s
are themselves invisible in a way.

07:53.975 --> 07:57.020
Wyatt, I know, I know.
I get it, I get it.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.605
Okay? But we can't just go
and pull out new powers,

07:59.688 --> 08:01.815
or else the witches
are gonna be going to the moon

08:01.899 --> 08:03.734
or time-traveling or some shit.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.446
It seems to me that if they can already
make other objects disappear--

08:07.530 --> 08:09.823
I'm sorry,
are you still arguing for invisibility?

08:09.907 --> 08:10.949
I always hated that.

08:11.034 --> 08:13.494
This isn't the fucking Fantastic Four,
Wyatt, okay?

08:13.577 --> 08:14.578
Accept the "no."

08:15.579 --> 08:17.790
Now, what's a power
that witches would have?

08:18.541 --> 08:24.255
Uh, maybe they could, like,
call upon the dead for help?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.800
- Dude, what? What's happening?

08:27.883 --> 08:30.761
Like, zombies? Dead--
Is that what we're going for now?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.888
No, not like zombies.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.184
Like talking to spirits, like,
in a séance-y sort of--

08:36.267 --> 08:37.768
What's happening?
Is he pitching ideas--

08:37.851 --> 08:40.729
I don't know. I don't know what I'm...
She was looking at me and I thought...

08:42.606 --> 08:44.025
Do you have any other ideas?

08:44.108 --> 08:46.027
Okay, we'll take a ten-minute break.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.611
That doesn't mean 20 minutes.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.280
All right.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.538
So, Gus...

08:57.621 --> 08:59.165
Arya has a test today?

08:59.248 --> 09:02.293
Yeah, uh, the ERBs.
State exam.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.377
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:03.461 --> 09:06.964
And, uh, Len tells me
that if she fails again,

09:07.048 --> 09:08.924
that she won't be able to work
on the show for a month.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.344
Uh, 30 working days.

09:11.427 --> 09:12.928
So it's actually a little bit
more than a month--

09:13.011 --> 09:15.723
Right, right. No.
See, that just can't happen.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.601
The next six episodes
are built around Arya.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.936
I mean, her character gets her period
for the first time,

09:21.019 --> 09:24.523
and so, you know, her witch powers
start to show themselves.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.734
That's cool.
That's a... cool idea.

09:26.817 --> 09:30.529
But if we lose Arya,
then our production schedule gets fucked.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.074
And you don't think you'd be able to,
like, shoot around her--

09:33.157 --> 09:34.325
Or...

09:34.408 --> 09:36.285
you could do your job...

09:36.369 --> 09:38.329
and make sure she passes a simple test.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.705
No, you're right... I'm sorry.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.915
-I shouldn't have said that. Uh-huh.
-No, no, no. Don't apologize.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.334
I... I only care
if she passes or not.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.460
-So...
-Mmm-hmm.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.671
I need you to promise me
that Arya will pass this test.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.842
Well, I'd love to promise you that,
but, um, you know,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.261
she still has to take the test.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.345
-Mmm-hmm.
-And it's just...

09:54.428 --> 09:56.639
it's really hard for me
to get her to focus,

09:56.722 --> 09:58.432
and I think it's because...

09:58.516 --> 10:00.601
maybe because she has, like,
early call times and--

10:00.684 --> 10:03.271
You're talking to me
like I actually give a fuck, okay?

10:03.354 --> 10:07.275
I'm not gonna solve this problem for you.
She's a child. She goes to school.

10:07.358 --> 10:09.777
I'm not the teacher here, okay?
Don't pull me in.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.070
-Okay.
-I like you.

10:12.155 --> 10:14.031
-Hey, I like you, too.
-But if she doesn't pass this test,

10:14.115 --> 10:15.616
I'm gonna have to fucking fire you.

10:16.284 --> 10:17.951
Arya will pass this test,
I promise.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.288
-Fantastic.
-Okay. Cool.

10:20.371 --> 10:22.706
You know, actually,
I was thinking about that whole...

10:22.790 --> 10:25.126
-call-upon-the-dead thing for next season.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.420
-Oh, you were?
-Yeah. Yeah, I was.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.213
-Oh, well, that's cool.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:29.297 --> 10:32.216
Well, hey, if you ever want me to come in
and we spitball ideas or anything,

10:32.300 --> 10:33.384
I'd be happy to, you know.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.635
Well, maybe we'll do that sometime.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.886
-Okay. Cool. Yeah.
-All right.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.096
Could you, uh, close that door
on your way out?

10:38.181 --> 10:39.598
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.767
So I was like,
"Why do you need a lock on your phone

10:41.850 --> 10:43.018
if you got nothing to hide?"

10:43.101 --> 10:44.395
Ryan, do you trust your wife?

10:45.354 --> 10:46.855
Yeah.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.733
She needs her digital privacy, Ryan.
We all do.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.985
I wouldn't want you to know
what I was looking at online.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.156
That doesn't make me a cheater.
It just makes me a human.

10:56.199 --> 10:59.327
So, in the meantime,
keep your hands off your wife's phone.

10:59.410 --> 11:00.494
Okay, Ryan?

11:02.496 --> 11:03.581
Let's take a break.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.334
When we come back,
we'll be talking to Lisa,

11:06.417 --> 11:10.087
who thinks two beds
might be better than one.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.591
Be right back, on Heart Work.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.969
Your next caller is 45.
She's from Colorado. She's got two kids.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.137
--Can I get you anything?

11:19.222 --> 11:21.682
-No, I'm good, thanks. Have a seat.
-Oh, okay.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.644
So, how you doing, Mickey?

11:25.728 --> 11:27.521
-Good, yeah.
-Yeah?

11:27.605 --> 11:29.147
Thanks for subbing in for Rob today.

11:29.232 --> 11:31.024
You know me,
I'm a real jack of all trades.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.693
Oh, I know you.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.152
Your new assistant starts tomorrow,

11:34.237 --> 11:35.238
-so you're set.
-Yes.

11:35.321 --> 11:39.116
Yeah. You've been giving me
a lot of great calls today, but...

11:39.199 --> 11:42.119
-you know who I wish I got a call from?
-Hmm?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.329
- Mickey.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.831
'Cause I would listen
and I would give her some help.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.416
Thanks, but--

11:47.500 --> 11:50.043
-Come on. What's got you down?
-Oh--

11:50.127 --> 11:51.128
Is it something in the office?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.921
Are you mad at me
because I had you fire Rob?

11:53.005 --> 11:54.172
No! No.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.843
All right, well...

11:57.926 --> 11:59.011
how'd he take it?

11:59.094 --> 12:00.263
Not good. Not good.

12:00.346 --> 12:01.680
-He was pretty upset.
-Yeah.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.350
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I figured.

12:04.433 --> 12:07.060
I got a bunch of drunk emails
at around 5:00 a.m.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.438
--He sent me a link to an ISIS video.

12:09.522 --> 12:12.983
Rob is a very hostile person.
I'm sorry if he ruined your weekend.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.234
No, he didn't ruin my weekend.

12:14.318 --> 12:17.530
It was just bullshit Eric drama,
but  that's over.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.533
-Oh, Eric. That rollercoaster, hmm?
-No, it's good, though.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.660
We're finally done.
I feel so much better about it.

12:23.494 --> 12:25.413
Best thing you can do right now?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.416
Don't try to feel better.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.668
Just feel. Feel it all.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.712
Today and tomorrow,
just pass through it.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.714
Because maybe...

12:35.798 --> 12:38.091
something positive has happened.

12:38.175 --> 12:41.554
Maybe you needed to...

12:41.637 --> 12:44.723
clean out some emotional space
for something good.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.518
Something new.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.898
-You're back on.
-Yeah.

12:59.322 --> 13:01.699
So I'm banging this chick, man,
and all of a sudden,

13:01.782 --> 13:03.283
the pictures start falling off the wall.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.411
I think I'm killing it.
It's an earthquake.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.912
Does this have dairy?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.622
No, you know I got you covered
on that dairy and gluten.

13:08.706 --> 13:09.748
I got that out of here for you.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.208
Well, last time, it had yogurt.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.462
Yeah, that was last time.
This is today. I covered it.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.303
I do not envy you, man.
That chick is a brat.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.389
Oh, no. She's not that bad.

13:25.473 --> 13:27.182
What are you talking about?
She's a prima donna

13:27.265 --> 13:28.684
and she drinks these green drinks.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.268
Who drinks these green drinks
when they're 12?

13:30.353 --> 13:32.270
- Yeah.
- Where's the Capri Sun at?

13:32.355 --> 13:34.857
I know. I'm in my 30s
and I don't even drink those.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.859
-I'd kill for a Capri Sun right now.
-Me, too.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.068
-You got one?
-No!

13:38.151 --> 13:40.529
Oh, man, you gotta stock up.
Get some Capri Suns in here.

13:40.613 --> 13:42.490
-Maybe, maybe. Maybe, man.
-Yeah.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.450
Hey, you know, I think...

13:44.533 --> 13:47.077
I think I can get her to pass this test.
Seriously.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.037
I mean, I just hope,
like, I can do it

13:49.121 --> 13:50.748
so Susan doesn't think
I'm, like, a fuck-up,

13:50.831 --> 13:52.833
'cause then she'll never,
like, read my spec ever.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.543
Oh, word.
What's a... what's a spec?

13:54.627 --> 13:57.463
It's like, when you write an episode
of a TV show,

13:57.546 --> 13:59.047
even though nobody asked you to,

13:59.131 --> 14:02.134
just to have a sample of, like,
how good or bad of a writer you are.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.844
Oh, you know what?
That... that might actually work.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.303
My aunt actually hates all the writers.

14:05.388 --> 14:07.598
All she does is talk about how
they do nothing but just fuck her up.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.476
Yeah, your aunt's a pretty big ballbuster,
I'm gonna admit. Yeah.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.436
I know.
That's why I never talk to her.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.980
She hooked me up with this gig
and I just stay out of her way.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.482
That's good.
It's a smart move.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.442
-What's wrong with your phone, man?
-What?

14:18.526 --> 14:20.152
You've been checking it all day, man.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.780
Oh, yeah, I'm just checking my texts
'cause I, like...

14:23.697 --> 14:25.408
met this girl and we've been having,
you know...

14:25.491 --> 14:28.369
-We had a good time, like, hanging out.
-Oh. Oh, yeah?

14:28.452 --> 14:29.453
Can I show you a picture?
Is that weird?

14:29.537 --> 14:30.579
-Oh, yeah, man.
-Is that creepy?

14:30.663 --> 14:31.997
Oh, yeah,
let me see what you're working with.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.082
-Her name's Mickey. Yeah.
-Oh, hell yeah, dude!

14:34.166 --> 14:36.835
Oh, yeah, she's fine, man.
It's blurry, but she's clearly fine.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.504
-She's good, man.
-She's like Dax Shepard's wife.

14:38.587 --> 14:39.963
-You know, like, that Frozen chick.
-Yeah.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.299
Right, what's her name?
Ildrus? Susan?

14:42.383 --> 14:43.717
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot.
-I don't know.

14:43.801 --> 14:46.637
Yeah, it's just,
like, I... I don't know.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.514
'Cause it's like...
I think I, like, overplayed my hand.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.392
Dude, freaking out only makes it worse.
She'll text, man.

14:51.475 --> 14:54.770
-What'd you text her?
-I texted her, like, "Sup?"

14:54.853 --> 14:56.689
-"Sup"? Just "Sup"?
-"Sup," question mark.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.023
-"Sup?" is perfect, man.
-Yeah?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.900
I've gotten laid
texting "sup" plenty of times.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.402
-Okay.
-She'll text, man. Don't worry about it.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.404
'Cause I go the other way before...

15:03.487 --> 15:04.988
You know, I'll end up, like,
texting so much,

15:05.072 --> 15:07.741
I end up sending, like, a fucking book
to somebody, you know?

15:07.825 --> 15:08.867
And that's never good. That's--

15:08.951 --> 15:12.162
Nothing dries up a vagina
more than a paragraph, man.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.464
"Who's having great sex? Not you?

15:21.547 --> 15:25.133
Let's figure out why,
Friday on Dr. Greg."

15:25.217 --> 15:26.259
Great. Number four.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.263
"Plaid, polka dots, infidelity,
co-dependency, you guessed it.

15:30.347 --> 15:34.184
We're talking about patterns,
tomorrow on Heart Work with Dr. Greg."

15:34.267 --> 15:36.228
Come on, that's... that's ridiculous.
Who wrote that?

15:36.311 --> 15:37.438
-I wrote that one.
-Oh.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.356
It's good.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.691
Number five, last one.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.235
"Pouring out a little too much beer
for your dead homies?

15:43.318 --> 15:46.655
How to cope with the loss of a friend
without losing your sobriety.

15:46.739 --> 15:49.867
Next Wednesday
on Heart Work with Dr. Greg."

15:49.950 --> 15:53.454
Dope. All right, I'll put some music
under those and we're good to go.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.414
All right. Great.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.418
We have fun together, don't we?

16:00.503 --> 16:02.004
Mmm-hmm.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.840
It is good that
we can talk about work or Eric,

16:04.923 --> 16:06.759
or breakups, or whatever.

16:06.842 --> 16:11.179
My last relationship was so brutal.
It was very toxic.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.517
I'm someone who likes to let people
be who they are, right?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.601
Uh-huh.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.020
She wanted me to define her.
She wanted me to be her daddy.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.272
I would come home from work
at the end of the day

16:20.355 --> 16:22.315
and she would say I abandoned her.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.609
Maybe I'm too giving.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.194
Hmm. Sounds like you guys
weren't a good fit.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.156
We were sexually incompatible.
I like sex and she didn't.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.410
What about you and Eric?
What went wrong?

16:34.578 --> 16:37.706
Uh, I just think he loved cocaine
more than he loved me.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.796
That is really funny.

16:46.799 --> 16:49.510
Wow. Life is so crazy, right?

16:49.593 --> 16:51.094
Yeah.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.430
You're not dating anyone,
I'm not dating anyone.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.643
And then I'm like, "Wow, I could never
date a co-worker. What a bad idea."

16:57.726 --> 17:00.563
- Yeah, what a bad idea.

17:01.689 --> 17:05.192
And then I think,
maybe one day, if...

17:05.275 --> 17:07.402
we were each working
at different stations,

17:07.485 --> 17:10.072
maybe, you know,
we could make that happen.

17:11.782 --> 17:13.659
I'm sorry, I don't really follow.

17:13.742 --> 17:18.872
I mean, is this job
worth not giving it a try?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.709
I don't know,
maybe we should both quit.

17:21.792 --> 17:23.544
I'm joking.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.631
- One of us quit? I'm kidding.

17:29.717 --> 17:30.968
I'm so flattered.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.346
I'm gonna go check on those promos.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.432
Maybe I should just quit?

17:37.515 --> 17:40.393
Come on, that's crazy talk, man.
Jesus.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.437
I know, but he's gonna fire me either way.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.314
Fucking Dr. Greg
is not gonna fire you, okay?

17:44.397 --> 17:48.026
Yes, he is. If he flirts with me
and I don't flirt back,

17:48.110 --> 17:50.738
in, like, eight weeks,
I'm gonna spill a coffee in a meeting

17:50.821 --> 17:52.948
and he's gonna fire me.
It's happened before.

17:53.031 --> 17:56.660
Shit. There's not a crazier motherfucker
than a therapist, man.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.912
-They're demented.
-I know.

17:58.996 --> 18:00.831
So what, he asked you out?

18:00.914 --> 18:01.915
No.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.836
What, then, like...
he wants you to blow him?

18:05.919 --> 18:09.590
-No, it's worse. He likes me.
-Oh, no, no, no.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.093
-Yeah. He likes me, I don't like him.
-I'm sorry.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.764
He's gonna find a reason to fire me,
and then I'm gonna be gone.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.182
He did it to Melanie
and he did it to Jane.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.977
I saw Jane a month ago.
She's working at Chipotle now.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.646
She looks ten years older.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.272
Shit.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.066
I heard Melanie moved to,
like, Arizona.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.029
I saw a photo with her on Facebook,
watering cactus. It was sad.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.322
I can't do it. Fuck.

18:34.406 --> 18:37.492
I have so much credit card debt,
I can't even quit if I want to.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.328
You can't lose this job.
It's a sweet gig, all right?

18:40.412 --> 18:42.956
The hours are great.
It's fucking easy, man.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.917
All we do is sit around most of the time.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.419
They don't even notice
we take long cigarette breaks.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.755
People here are lax
with people like us, you know?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.507
Shit.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.301
Stay here, man.
You're family.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.180
It's too slimy. No offense.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.390
That's great.
Very good.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.852
And what other words would you use
to describe the taste of the meat?

19:03.936 --> 19:04.937
The ham.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.190
Rubbery. Filmy. Watery.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.734
-Cool. Great--
-Thin. Gross. Didn't want it.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.653
Yeah, and it has, like...

19:12.736 --> 19:14.905
weird little veins in it,
like, little pig veins.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.491
You know how they make this stuff?
The animals are bred for death.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.870
These animals don't have any thoughts.
Okay? They eat and they shit.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.247
God gave them to us to kill and eat.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.334
I understand, but if you were
looking for a new lunch snack,

19:27.417 --> 19:29.336
is this one you would consider using?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.922
Does it have an oaky, barbecue-y taste?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.966
I only eat things I can grow myself.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.592
Why are you in this tasting?

19:35.676 --> 19:38.386
They told me
I was gonna get to see a free movie.

19:38.470 --> 19:41.139
Some Reese Witherspoon
and The Muppets movie.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.515
I don't know what to tell you, sir.

19:42.599 --> 19:43.809
I think you called back the wrong number.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.270
You know, if you wanna see a free movie,
all you have to do is call the theater

19:47.354 --> 19:48.939
and tell them
that the projector was all fucked up.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.148
I don't know about that, ma'am.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.693
I'm just trying to find out
what you thought of the taste.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.903
Maybe what your children
would think of the taste.

19:54.987 --> 19:58.949
If they were gonna improve the flavor,
what aspect of it would they improve?

19:59.032 --> 20:02.160
I like spicy things.
Really spicy things.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.831
Like, so spicy most people can't eat it,
but I can eat it.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.416
And I think that's kind of, like...
the future of snacks.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.293
--Okay, um...

20:10.377 --> 20:12.796
and I just need two minutes
and I'll be right back.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.509
It takes so long to eat.
This is like gum.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.137
-A ham-flavored gum.
-You're eating death.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.430
Mickey, is everything all right?

20:22.514 --> 20:24.725
Yeah, totally.
Uh, I just need to vent.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.059
-Is now a bad time?
-Not at all.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.978
I'm flattered you called.
What's up?

20:28.061 --> 20:29.354
How much money do you have?

20:29.437 --> 20:33.233
If I was unemployed for, like, six months,
could you afford our rent?

20:33.316 --> 20:34.359
Oh.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.695
Uh, I was actually going to ask you
for a little more time this month.

20:37.780 --> 20:40.365
My grandma hurt her hip
and she has dementia,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.743
and I've been sending her money,
but she keeps losing the money.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.871
And she's been yelling at the nurses
and accusing them of stealing it.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.748
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, it's fine.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.417
Um... I'm not gonna lose this job.
I'll make it work.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.335
That's the spirit.
You'll make it work.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.754
-Just like I do...
-All right.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.088
- ...even when I'm--

20:57.674 --> 21:00.718
-But Mother, killing is wrong.
-Not always.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.888
If there's a positive force
in the universe,

21:02.971 --> 21:04.639
then there has to be a negative force.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.934
It's how the universe stays balanced.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.770
And who's to say which is positive
and which is negative?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.396
What is it like to kill, Mother?

21:11.479 --> 21:14.607
There's a sense of cleansing,
of making things right.

21:15.233 --> 21:18.236
-I could never hurt anyone.
-What if you were helping them?

21:18.862 --> 21:21.448
Some people need to be freed
from this realm.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.826
I understand now.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.744
I understand my obligation...

21:28.496 --> 21:29.747
to kill.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.335
And cutting.
Let's cut, people.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.630
Wow, Arya.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.550
You were really good in that scene.
Bravo.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.845
Thanks. When the writing is good,
I can do a good job.

21:42.928 --> 21:45.013
But lately, the writing has been horrible.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.307
Oh, yeah?
I mean, well, you really got something.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.852
It's like, some actors, you know,
they can work really hard,

21:49.935 --> 21:53.271
but they don't got the magic.
But you got the magic.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.481
Seriously, I'm impressed.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.692
Well, I know that,
but what I really wanna do is movies.

21:57.775 --> 22:01.363
Like Simone, she was in a movie with
Beyoncé and she got to play a prostitute.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.366
-Her and Beyoncé were co-prostitutes?
-Yeah.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.618
Dream job. Right? Totally.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.204
Well, hey,
now that we're feeling good,

22:09.287 --> 22:10.831
why don't we jump into class,

22:10.914 --> 22:12.290
- ride this enthusiasm--

22:12.374 --> 22:13.917
Come on, let's go in this golf cart.

22:14.001 --> 22:16.336
No, nope, nope, nope, nope.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.420
Come on, we, uh...

22:17.504 --> 22:20.257
we only got, like, one last
cram sesh to do before these ERBs,

22:20.340 --> 22:21.591
-so--
-One ride. That's it.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.512
If I give you a ride, you gotta promise
me, like, 20 good minutes, okay?

22:25.595 --> 22:26.638
Mmm-hmm.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.556
-All right, okay--
-But I'm driving.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.643
No, I'll drive. Okay?
You could kill us both.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.896
You know how bad that would look?
For me?

22:38.691 --> 22:39.902
Come on, faster!

22:39.985 --> 22:42.779
What? Arya, this is, like,
the fastest it goes.

22:42.862 --> 22:47.075
Just go a little bit faster
and we'll do 30 minutes. I promise.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.535
Okay. Hold on.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.873
So, uh... time to study?

22:54.416 --> 22:56.501
Come on, five more minutes.
This is where it gets good.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.754
Okay.
Five more minutes.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.348
Fuck. Come on.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.351
Come on.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.657
It's so nice that you asked me for lunch,
you know.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.992
We never have lunch together.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.078
I know. I'm usually so busy.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.205
And you always seem so tired.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.082
I do?

23:35.165 --> 23:37.167
Not in a bad way.
Just, you know...

23:37.250 --> 23:41.088
when you get like that, I just ask myself,
"What about life is tiring her out?"

23:41.171 --> 23:42.922
I don't know. I just...

23:43.006 --> 23:45.217
I have a hard time
dealing with shit sometimes.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.343
I know, but...

23:47.635 --> 23:49.721
you can't see life as the enemy.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.350
Life is what you make of it...
right?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.060
Seems like you made the right choice.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.437
Sometimes I wonder, you know?

23:58.646 --> 24:00.648
Sometimes I wonder if I could've been
the next Karl Malone.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.985
I played power forward,
so...

24:03.901 --> 24:07.155
One of many reasons
I wish I was black.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.160
Not really.
I mean, not that I wouldn't wanna be.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.536
You know what I...

24:13.620 --> 24:15.538
Just...
I'm comfortable with who I am.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.131
What was that for?

24:24.214 --> 24:26.424
Just always wanted to see
what that'd be like.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.801
How was it?

24:28.885 --> 24:30.428
Need a larger sampling.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.014
Take as much as you want.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.939
This is so stupid. I'm tired.

24:42.024 --> 24:44.067
Arya, seriously...

24:44.151 --> 24:46.986
Like, I don't wanna freak you out
or anything, but it's like...

24:47.904 --> 24:50.657
if you wanna keep working on the show,
you have to, like, pass this test.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.410
All right? That's...
Them's the rules, okay?

24:53.493 --> 24:54.661
Whatever.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.414
Don't "whatever" me, okay?

24:57.497 --> 25:00.458
This is, like, an important life lesson.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.045
It's like, in the real world,
you gotta...

25:03.128 --> 25:06.131
finish tasks,
you have to complete work, you know?

25:06.214 --> 25:09.217
'Cause if you don't have,
like, proper work habits,

25:09.301 --> 25:11.594
when things don't get so easy,
you know,

25:11.678 --> 25:14.764
things are gonna be kinda tough,
if you don't have an education.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.349
Why wouldn't things be easy?

25:16.433 --> 25:18.435
Think of most child actors, you know?

25:18.518 --> 25:20.103
They're not actors when they get older,

25:20.187 --> 25:22.480
'cause when they get older,
they start looking weird,

25:22.564 --> 25:25.067
and they get, like,
big ears and they're like,

25:25.150 --> 25:27.569
"Oh, I'm not as cute
as I used to be anymore," you know?

25:27.652 --> 25:31.114
So I'm gonna get big ears and be ugly
and not be able to get jobs?

25:31.198 --> 25:33.450
No...
I wasn't saying that--

25:33.533 --> 25:35.493
Are people not gonna like me
when I'm not little?

25:35.577 --> 25:38.371
No, I'm just telling you that, like...

25:38.455 --> 25:40.832
For a lot of child actors,
when they don't have work,

25:40.915 --> 25:42.459
and they don't have
something to fall back on,

25:42.542 --> 25:45.795
they just get addicted to drugs, you know?
Or they become homeless.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.755
So I'm gonna get ugly and be homeless?

25:47.839 --> 25:51.218
I'm not... saying that.
I'm just saying...

25:52.135 --> 25:53.511
You're in a bubble now.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.681
Nobody's gonna tell you the truth.
I'm telling you the truth.

25:56.764 --> 26:00.268
Life is tough, things get hard,
and you're gonna wanna have a backup plan.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.562
So can we please just focus and study?

26:02.645 --> 26:04.689
- You're so mean! No!

26:14.532 --> 26:16.826
Did you just tell Arya
that she's a bad actress?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.495
What? No. Never.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.372
'Cause my little girl
is gonna take on the world.

26:20.455 --> 26:24.292
Don't you ever tell my daughter
that she is anything less than perfect.

26:24.376 --> 26:27.212
'Course not. I was just saying,
you know, I think...

26:27.295 --> 26:29.214
She has a big test
this afternoon, that's all--

26:29.297 --> 26:32.008
And she'll ace it!
Because she's tough.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.635
And she's a fucking champion.

26:34.552 --> 26:35.928
Motherfucker.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.180
Sorry.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.228
--Say something about my dick.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.355
Your dick...
it feels so good.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.439
-Yeah?
-Yes.

26:46.523 --> 26:47.690
-It does, right?
-Doctor.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.152
-It does feel good.
-Okay.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.034
I know you wanna fire me.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.288
What? What?

27:03.165 --> 27:05.124
- You can't fire me now.

27:06.501 --> 27:07.710
I don't want to fire you.

27:08.753 --> 27:11.130
You can't fire me,
'cause you're fucking me.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.843
I'm not fucking you.
You're fucking me.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.094
-No.
-Yeah.

27:17.179 --> 27:19.222
-Yeah.
-You're fucking me.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.780
-You just came?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.242
I haven't yet, so...

27:39.326 --> 27:40.493
Fine.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.724
I feel a little weird.

28:06.228 --> 28:07.645
Five minutes left.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.608
You're doing great.
How you feeling?

28:11.691 --> 28:12.900
I'm done.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.320
Yeah? Okay, perfect.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.740
See, that wasn't that bad, right?

28:22.118 --> 28:24.161
Arya...

28:24.246 --> 28:26.581
You did, like, less than half of this.
What's the deal?

28:26.664 --> 28:29.709
I'm done, I'm tired,
and I do not care about that test.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.420
What is wrong with you?

28:33.338 --> 28:34.464
You wanna lose your job?

28:34.547 --> 28:36.966
-You want me to lose my job?
-Don't be mad at me.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.968
I'm not mad at you.
It's just...

28:39.051 --> 28:41.221
If you fail,
you can't work for 30 days.

28:41.304 --> 28:42.514
And...

28:42.597 --> 28:45.475
you know, a lot of people
are gonna be in a lot of trouble.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.727
Including me, okay?

28:47.810 --> 28:50.272
Susan's gonna be pissed off at me
and she's gonna fire me

28:50.355 --> 28:51.356
and then she's never
gonna read my script--

28:51.439 --> 28:52.565
Stop!

28:52.649 --> 28:55.568
I'm under so much pressure right now!

28:55.652 --> 28:57.362
I don't even want to work here!

28:57.445 --> 29:01.283
I hate this place so much.
Everyone is old!

29:01.366 --> 29:04.994
Okay. It's okay.
Hey, don't get upset, okay?

29:05.077 --> 29:07.163
Uh, we got four minutes left.
Let's just rip through this.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.916
I wanna go to a real school,
with real friends!

29:09.999 --> 29:11.584
You can pass this.
You just gotta sit down.

29:11.668 --> 29:12.877
-Okay, please?
-You're my best friend!

29:12.960 --> 29:15.797
You're my best friend
because all my friends hate me

29:15.880 --> 29:17.632
because I met Taylor Swift.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.426
Well, that's cool, right?

29:19.509 --> 29:20.677
You get to meet Taylor Swift.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.012
You get to make
a bunch of spending money, huh?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.472
I'd love to make the money you're making.

29:24.556 --> 29:25.723
I don't even get the money!

29:25.807 --> 29:28.685
My parents take it!
And they're getting divorced!

29:28.768 --> 29:31.771
- What? Whoa, shit. Hold on, it's okay--

29:31.854 --> 29:33.981
I hear them arguing
through the walls!

29:34.065 --> 29:35.567
Through the walls!

29:35.650 --> 29:38.486
Okay.
Hey, Arya, it's okay, okay?

29:38.570 --> 29:40.822
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.365
I'm so sorry.

30:05.722 --> 30:08.433
"Two apples are dropped
off a ten-story building.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.142
One apple is five pounds..."

30:10.226 --> 30:11.644
What the fuck?

30:15.565 --> 30:16.983
I can't believe you said that.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.362
What, about not wanting
to touch your asshole?

30:21.863 --> 30:23.781
No, about me firing you.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.409
Oh. Well, yeah, it's true.
You can't now.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.623
You think that I would
do something like that?

30:32.957 --> 30:37.128
Yeah, if I rejected you, I'd be gone.
That's what you do. But...

30:37.211 --> 30:40.256
now that we fucked, you can't,
because that would be sexual harassment.

30:41.007 --> 30:44.176
-That's how you see me?
-Mmm, sort of, yeah.

30:45.678 --> 30:50.057
You think I'm someone who would fire you
if you didn't accept my advances?

30:50.141 --> 30:52.685
-That's ridiculous.
-Oh, really? Well, what about Jane?

30:52.769 --> 30:55.062
You got all pervy with her
and then you fired her.

30:56.147 --> 30:58.608
I fired Jane because she stole from me.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.110
She bought a Birkin bag
with my credit card.

31:02.654 --> 31:04.280
Well, what about Melanie?

31:04.364 --> 31:05.948
Melanie was dumb!

31:06.032 --> 31:08.576
She made all of my passwords 1-2-3-4!

31:08.660 --> 31:09.952
My identity was stolen.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.914
Oh...

31:12.997 --> 31:13.998
I didn't know that.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.625
No, you didn't know that.
You know why?

31:15.708 --> 31:18.836
Because I was concerned
about their reputations.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.632
I wanted to have sex with you because
I thought that we shared something.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.843
Maybe shared some sort
of special connection.

31:25.927 --> 31:29.514
Do you really think that I'm, like,
that type of manipulative person?

31:29.597 --> 31:33.100
Do I give off just, like,
some kind of fucking awfulness? Huh?

31:33.184 --> 31:34.686
Or are you the awful one?

31:35.603 --> 31:37.730
Can't tell if you're
fucking with me right now.

31:37.814 --> 31:40.567
Let me tell you something, okay?
I am just a man.

31:40.650 --> 31:43.194
I get up and I talk to people,

31:43.277 --> 31:45.697
and they tell me their problems
and I try to give them strategies

31:45.780 --> 31:48.575
to help them make their lives
just a little bit better.

31:48.658 --> 31:51.786
That's what I do with my days, huh!

31:51.869 --> 31:54.914
Do you know what it takes
to be the type of person

31:54.997 --> 31:58.209
to call somebody for self-help
and then they hang up,

31:58.292 --> 31:59.961
and I don't know
if they've killed themselves.

32:00.044 --> 32:02.880
I don't know if they're happy now,
I don't know shit!

32:02.964 --> 32:07.552
All I know is there is some sort of voice
on the other side of the line

32:07.635 --> 32:12.098
that is fucking crazy, that I am,
all of a sudden, responsible for!

32:12.181 --> 32:14.058
And I do that. I'm a saint.

32:14.141 --> 32:18.480
I should have my face up on a fucking
stained glass window in a goddamn church!

32:18.563 --> 32:20.106
And I'm a Jew!

32:21.398 --> 32:24.318
You know, I don't know if you're familiar
with the term "projection,"

32:24.401 --> 32:25.612
but I got something to show ya.

32:25.695 --> 32:31.158
It's a little movie called
Mickey Has No Idea Who the Fuck I Am!

32:31.242 --> 32:32.619
I don't know why I bother.

32:32.702 --> 32:35.121
I don't know
why I fucking bother!

32:38.458 --> 32:40.292
You just really hurt my feelings.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.145
-Susan, hey.
-She pass?

33:00.312 --> 33:01.606
Yeah. Yeah, she passed.

33:01.689 --> 33:04.817
Connor? Tell Len and Mary
that Arya passed the test.

33:04.901 --> 33:06.819
Oh, also, could you go on
to my Paleta account

33:06.903 --> 33:09.614
and make sure that I'm signed up
for the plan with the most snacks?

33:09.697 --> 33:11.616
I'm fucking starving every day.

33:13.409 --> 33:17.872
Hey, um, Susan,
can I just... talk to you, real quick?

33:17.955 --> 33:19.874
Um, I just...

33:19.957 --> 33:22.794
I wanted to let you know,
uh, 'cause I think...

33:22.877 --> 33:28.550
you should know that the, uh,
reason Arya passed is because I...

33:28.633 --> 33:30.342
I helped her cheat.

33:31.427 --> 33:32.720
So it's taken care of?

33:33.638 --> 33:37.016
Yeah, it is.
It's taken care of and...

33:37.099 --> 33:40.562
I guess I was sort of thinking,
you know, since I came through for you,

33:40.645 --> 33:44.190
and helped the show
not get shut down, maybe...

33:44.273 --> 33:45.942
you could do me a solid
and take a look at this--

33:46.025 --> 33:48.903
So what you meant was that
you were so bad at your job of teaching

33:48.986 --> 33:51.197
that you had to cheat for her.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.866
Uh, yeah.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.869
I mean, I guess, um, you know,
it's not really a teaching thing,

33:56.953 --> 33:58.538
it's more she has...

33:58.621 --> 34:02.542
just difficulty learning things and, um,
she's under a lot of pressure.

34:02.625 --> 34:03.918
We all are.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.629
Uh, well, you know,
she's 12 years old. So...

34:06.713 --> 34:10.216
I wish I was that rich when I was 12.
But I was in Baltimore.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.343
-Oh, Baltimore?
-Mmm-hmm.

34:12.426 --> 34:16.513
Yeah, I'm from South Dakota, so...
I struggled, too.

34:16.598 --> 34:18.099
I mean, I think that's why
I work so hard around here--

34:18.182 --> 34:21.561
Thank you, Gus,
for doing your job...

34:21.644 --> 34:23.020
that you get paid to do.

34:23.688 --> 34:25.522
Okay.

34:25.607 --> 34:29.611
Hey, Connor? Uh, see if Liz
is around to talk wardrobe.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.196
Don't tell her I'm here,
just see if she's around.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.241
-Close that door for me, please.
-Uh-huh.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.618
Thank you.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.454
- This is what I do.
- Mmm.

34:40.537 --> 34:44.834
This way, the whole tub fills up
with syrup and you can just dip into it.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.628
Good idea.

34:47.629 --> 34:49.171
Sometimes it's fun to eat without limits.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.799
I'm just gonna eat this
whole thing tonight.

34:51.883 --> 34:55.219
Yeah, I mean, it's not like you can gain
ten pounds in one night.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.680
One pound, two pounds max.

35:03.019 --> 35:04.646
Oh, shit, I forgot to text Gus.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.653
See? This isn't hard at all.
I could totally drive a car.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.038
Let's go find somewhere
where we can go really fast.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.206
Yes! Yeah.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.541
Floor this son of a bitch!

35:25.625 --> 35:28.920
Let's go, come on. Whoo!

35:29.003 --> 35:30.296
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

35:30.379 --> 35:32.381
- This is awesome.
- Yeah.
