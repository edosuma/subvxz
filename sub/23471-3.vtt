WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.048
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Elena] This is gonna be good.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.675
Sounds like Alex is home.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.051
No,  Mami,  that's Elena.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.720
But I hear friends.

00:12.554 --> 00:16.141
Hey, Elena. Who are all these peeps?
What's up, peeps?

00:16.224 --> 00:17.726
Okay, so stop saying "peeps."

00:17.809 --> 00:21.730
Oh, 'cause peeps are candy chicks
used to celebrate pagan fertility,

00:21.813 --> 00:24.149
and women are more than just baby-makers?
I get it.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.152
Maybe don't say anything.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.780
Anyway, this is the advocacy group
I was telling you about.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.907
The Feminist Gamers of Echo Park.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.910
We've been hanging out online
and this is our first meeting IRL.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.121
Welcome. What's everybody's name?

00:38.204 --> 00:40.749
I'm Dani. My pronouns are "she" and "her."

00:40.832 --> 00:43.293
Syd. My pronouns are "they" and "them."

00:43.376 --> 00:45.628
I'm Margaux. Pronouns "ze" and "zir."

00:47.088 --> 00:49.048
I'm Penelope.
My thoughts are "Huh?" and "What?"

00:51.009 --> 00:52.469
Seriously, what is happening?

00:52.552 --> 00:55.055
Well, because some people
are gender non-conforming,

00:55.138 --> 00:56.431
they have preferred pronouns.

00:56.890 --> 01:03.480
Ah! I am Lydia. Pronouns "Ly-dee-a."

01:04.064 --> 01:06.566
We're going downtown to protest
the release of a new video game.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.027
Blood-splosion Six.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.737
I guess you think it's too violent, huh?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.113
No, we love that part.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.157
When you create your avatar,

01:14.240 --> 01:16.785
there are only
two gender non-binary characters.

01:16.868 --> 01:20.747
And the advertising strongly suggested
there would be three.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.250
Okay, just, you know, be careful.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.044
Don't worry. I'll be watching them.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.420
Why would you be watching Syd?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.464
-I meant you.
-My pronoun is "her."

01:29.547 --> 01:31.508
-I thought she was "her."
-We're both "her."

01:31.591 --> 01:32.550
You mean "them."

01:32.634 --> 01:35.303
No, "they" is "them."
Stop making this confusing.

01:40.058 --> 01:40.892
'Sup?

01:42.519 --> 01:47.899
Ay, papito.  You are barking up
so many wrong trees.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.861
I love all the activism, but make sure
it doesn't affect your homework.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.987
-Because--
-I need to

01:53.071 --> 01:54.489
-build up my transcript.
-Build up your transcript.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.324
-And crush the PSATs!
-And crush the PSATs!

01:56.407 --> 01:58.576
Wha... Yes! That's my girl!

01:59.619 --> 02:04.082
Okay, everybody! When we get there,
she takes her team to the stairs,

02:04.165 --> 02:07.418
ze takes zir team to the parking lot,
and they take their team to the corner.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.505
He, she, they, and ze will all meet up
at the fair-trade coffee shop

02:10.588 --> 02:12.841
-between the two Starbucks. Got it?
-[all] Got it!

02:12.924 --> 02:14.551
[Margaux] Let's march!

02:17.470 --> 02:19.139
She must have practiced that.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.184
[theme song playing]

03:12.317 --> 03:14.027
We got a stabilized GSW.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.404
Start one liter normal
saline bolus wide open,

03:16.487 --> 03:18.072
prep room two. Page a trauma team.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.199
Hey! I say all that.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.746
I'm sorry. Nurse practitioner in training.
It's my first day. I'm a little nervous.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.830
Don't let it happen again.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.917
Do everything she just said.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.631
Penelope Alvarez?

03:36.591 --> 03:37.550
Oh, my God.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.594
Max Ferraro?

03:39.677 --> 03:40.929
Oh, my God!

03:42.555 --> 03:45.308
Oh! I-- I can't believe you're here!

03:46.100 --> 03:48.019
The last time I saw you was in Kabul,
right?

03:48.102 --> 03:49.229
Yeah, at the field hospital!

03:49.312 --> 03:52.106
The one where they turned the mess hall
into a salsa club on Thursday nights.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.775
Yeah, that's right. The Kabul Cabana!

03:53.858 --> 03:56.402
-[chuckles]
-Have you always been this tall?

03:56.486 --> 03:59.489
You haven't seen me in a while.
Had a growth spurt at 40.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.199
[both laugh]

04:01.282 --> 04:02.825
-It's great to see you!
-Yeah!

04:04.535 --> 04:05.912
So, how are ya? How's Victor?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.789
Uh, Victor, he, um...

04:08.706 --> 04:09.999
We're divorced. [chuckles]

04:10.083 --> 04:12.377
He's in Afghanistan doing
the contractor thing.

04:12.961 --> 04:16.422
-How's Amber?
-She's in Altadena, doing our contractor.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.719
Anyway, we're divorced.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.096
[both laugh]

04:25.765 --> 04:28.309
-Sorry to hear that. [chuckles]
-Yeah, same.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.563
We should, um, get together
after work sometime, catch up.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.484
[chuckles] Uh...

04:37.193 --> 04:40.947
Look, I'm gonna be real with you
because you are cute. [chuckles]

04:41.030 --> 04:41.948
Uh...

04:42.031 --> 04:45.868
It's not gonna happen, you know.
Between work, my two kids, and school,

04:45.952 --> 04:49.664
I don't have any free time.
Until I graduate, this is my social life.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.084
Nurse Alvarez. We need you to deal
with that anorectal abscess.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.423
Saturday night came early! [chuckles]

04:59.882 --> 05:01.092
I gotta go drain a butt.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.139
Here you go, Lydia.

05:06.931 --> 05:10.059
A little gift to grab
those hard-to-reach items.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.272
Magnificent!

05:16.816 --> 05:19.944
Wow. So when I get older,
will I be easily amazed, too?

05:20.695 --> 05:22.030
Hush,  papito.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.950
-[chuckles] Leslie has been so helpful!
-[chuckles]

05:26.576 --> 05:29.245
That's true. Now  Abuelita  won't
need you to come over

05:29.329 --> 05:30.913
and get jars down from the top shelf.

05:35.001 --> 05:35.835
Whoops.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.923
-[laughing] My gosh!
-So how did it go?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.258
Amazing! [laughs]

05:42.341 --> 05:44.969
We delivered a powerful message
and we were heard.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.222
[chuckles]
Dani was, honestly, inspirational.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.391
So you got them to change the video game?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.935
No. There was no one in the building
because it's Saturday.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.230
A security guard said
if we came back next week,

05:56.314 --> 05:58.524
we can tour the building and get T-shirts.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.153
And we will wear them ironically!

06:02.862 --> 06:04.530
Yay, us! [laughs]

06:04.614 --> 06:08.576
This calls for celebration. Why don't I
cook some food for your friends?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.828
Great idea!
Do you guys want to stay for dinner?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.790
-Sure.
-Oh, you guys have fun, but I gotta go.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.666
So everybody should probably go.
[chuckles]

06:17.126 --> 06:18.795
-We can meet up next week.
-Yeah.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.754
Bye!

06:19.837 --> 06:21.714
-[Dani] Bye.
-[Margaux] Bye.

06:22.131 --> 06:27.011
What a nice group of...
human people friends.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.808
I heard about the pronoun thing.
Now I'm terrified to speak.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.352
Why are you smiling?

06:34.936 --> 06:40.983
I think somebody has a crush on "her."

06:42.193 --> 06:44.237
Dani? No, I don't! I don't even know her!

06:44.320 --> 06:45.488
You have a crush on her!

06:45.571 --> 06:48.157
[laughs] No, no, no.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.201
When it comes to detecting romance,

06:50.284 --> 06:55.039
I am like cousin Aurensio
at the beach with his metal detector.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.253
So you found nothing
and you're sweating through your shirt?

07:01.838 --> 07:02.880
Don't be bashful.

07:03.214 --> 07:08.219
I think it is fantastic to be young
and in love and to flirt.

07:08.719 --> 07:13.933
And by the way, I can teach you things
because your flirting is  de madre.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.939
I wasn't flirting.

07:20.022 --> 07:23.609
And we're not talking about this.
Besides, Mom says I'm too young to date.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.862
But never too young to flirt.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.158
When I came out of my mother's womb,
I winked at the doctor!

07:32.410 --> 07:35.455
I guess you always
had a thing for doctors, huh?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.666
Eh, I got over it.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.545
I will teach you to flirt.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.507
If they say something clever,
laugh loudly,

07:46.591 --> 07:49.552
throw your head back,
and reveal your perfect neck.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.137
[laughing]

07:56.100 --> 07:58.186
I'm a fan of the specific compliment.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.439
I really like your shirt.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.316
It's a great color on you.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.360
¡Gracias, papito!

08:08.237 --> 08:09.864
[laughing nervously]

08:12.158 --> 08:14.202
Will you two stop flirting
with each other?

08:14.285 --> 08:15.453
It's beyond creepy!

08:17.163 --> 08:21.083
Oh, welcome home!
We are flirting!  Qué  fun!

08:21.167 --> 08:24.670
Ma, when are you not flirting?
Are you doing your famous...

08:27.507 --> 08:28.799
[imitates Lydia laughing]

08:30.426 --> 08:33.888
Classic. That's how I get
pork loin at half price.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.934
-Wait, what's going on?
-Elena has a crush.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.728
A crush? Uh-uh. No.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.022
I don't need to remind you that
while you're in school,

08:43.105 --> 08:45.274
there is no time for dating.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.443
Lupe, don't crush her crush.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.613
[scoffs] You're the one
who taught me this!

08:50.696 --> 08:53.115
You and  Papi  constantly
made me focus on school.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.660
And I hated it, too,
but it ended up being a good thing.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.372
And now I pass the annoyance on to you.
Elena, I'm sorry, but you can't date.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.749
-Fine, can we be done now?
-Look, people get crushes.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.545
Maybe you see this person
and instantly your knees get weak

09:05.628 --> 09:08.589
and your brain starts to melt,
and you think maybe I'm not dead inside.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.508
Why did I wear granny panties today?

09:11.092 --> 09:13.678
You can't think of anything else
because you want them so much.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.180
Well, too bad! We shut that crush down!

09:17.473 --> 09:20.226
Because we don't let anything
get in the way of our education.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.727
Even  maldito  crystal blue eyes!

09:23.104 --> 09:27.108
Oh, you are so strict. And very specific.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.363
I don't care. School comes first,
dating comes never.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.781
Okay, whatever!

09:33.864 --> 09:38.244
Ay,  Lupita, Elena can't help it
if she has feelings.

09:38.327 --> 09:42.290
Besides, flirting can be fun,
and it doesn't hurt anyone.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.961
[meows]

09:57.013 --> 09:57.930
Hey, there.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.975
-Did you get through your second day okay?
-Yep.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.436
How'd all that butt stuff go?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.899
You mean, was I successful in satisfying
the requirements for my clinical studies?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.192
I was.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.278
Okay.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.865
You, uh, heading home?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.159
No, I'm going to the club.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.496
Why are you being mean?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.499
I don't know.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.210
[both exhale]

10:34.592 --> 10:35.843
[whispers] Oh, my God.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.512
Por el amor de Dios.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.724
Yeah, I liked it too.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.645
[both chuckle]

10:48.648 --> 10:49.732
[knocking at door]

10:50.483 --> 10:51.901
Oh, my God, I did a bad thing.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.821
I mean, it was good. It was real good.
But bad, bad.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.448
It was such a huge mistake!

10:57.865 --> 11:01.744
Oh, I've seen this before. [clears throat]
Sex, drugs, or Cheesecake Factory?

11:03.579 --> 11:06.123
I met a guy at work, and I slept with him.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.959
What is that, like a Make-A-Wish thing?

11:09.043 --> 11:11.545
No! What?

11:11.629 --> 11:12.463
No!

11:15.132 --> 11:17.968
But it was wrong! And I'm freaking out!

11:18.052 --> 11:21.555
Okay, okay, okay, come here, come here.
Just sit down.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.307
Just walk me through what happened.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.142
Paramedic I knew from way back.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.478
I mean, he's... He's a really good guy.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.938
-But I don't know him well enough--
-Yeah.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.524
I'm not interested in the boring history
of your friendship.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.401
I was thinking more,

11:33.484 --> 11:35.236
"We met in the ER.

11:36.278 --> 11:39.865
-He gave me ten ccs of hot--"
-No, I'm serious, Schneider!

11:40.866 --> 11:41.909
I have never...

11:41.992 --> 11:43.911
I've never done anything like this before.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.830
I have a strict seven-date policy.

11:45.913 --> 11:49.291
Well, this is the second guy
you've hooked up with in 20 years.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.002
Maybe it's time to update that policy.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.840
Dating has changed since the 1800s.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.803
Guilt, shame, and regret are things
of the past. Be sex-positive, girl.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.139
I'm a mother. I'm sex negative.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.725
I'm dating a mother. You know her. Nikki.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.852
Finn's mom?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.562
-Yeah!
-Ugh.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.730
-Hello, Penelope.
-Hey, hi!

12:11.814 --> 12:13.524
Oh, my God! [chuckles]

12:13.607 --> 12:15.151
I didn't mean anything.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.904
Oh, please. My self-esteem is bulletproof.
Obviously.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.117
I was just telling Pene about our sitch.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.327
Oh, yeah, it's great.

12:25.411 --> 12:30.249
I come over, tell him to do stuff to me,
he does it, I go home. You should get one.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.835
Oh, no, no, no. That is okay.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.548
I think what Nikki
was kinda dancing around

12:39.008 --> 12:42.386
is that you don't always have to have
a relationship with a capital "R."

12:42.470 --> 12:46.932
Sometimes all you need is what
the great poets of the Renaissance called

12:47.016 --> 12:47.892
a junk buddy.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.605
Exactly. You don't even have to like them.
Hands.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.611
Ah, see, I don't want that.
I can't have sex without love.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.322
Oh. That's so sad.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.746
So, are you gonna ask Dani out?

13:08.996 --> 13:12.082
What? No. It's just complicated, okay?

13:12.666 --> 13:16.295
I get it. You don't have a crush on Dani
and you don't want to talk about it.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.215
Okay, I do have a crush! I do, I do, I do!

13:20.090 --> 13:22.343
Whoa! Act like you've been there.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.637
I haven't been there!

13:24.720 --> 13:27.389
The pool of local lesbians
my age is not that big.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.099
They could all fit in one pool.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.520
Be a pretty sweet pool.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.025
I just...

13:38.984 --> 13:42.238
I assumed that coming out
was going to be the difficult part,

13:42.696 --> 13:44.824
but now that I like someone, I just...

13:45.407 --> 13:46.575
I don't know if Dani's gay.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.537
What if she's not? I don't want to be
the gay girl that asks out

13:49.620 --> 13:51.747
a straight girl.
That's such a trope.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.917
Huh. Gay dating sounds tricky.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.587
I just toss out a couple of "sups,"
and see who responds.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.007
Being a straight dude is the best.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.012
What I'm really afraid of is that

14:07.096 --> 14:09.932
I'll ask Dani out
and she'll give me one of those...

14:10.766 --> 14:12.476
"Oh..."

14:13.602 --> 14:16.397
-What does that mean?
-It means,

14:16.480 --> 14:21.569
"I'm not gay and you think I am
and now we have a situation."

14:22.278 --> 14:24.280
You got all that from, "Oh?"

14:25.656 --> 14:26.991
I'm just scared.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.034
What if she runs away or something?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.413
So instead, you are running away!

14:33.414 --> 14:36.166
Abuelita!
Can't a girl have a moment of privacy?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.002
I live behind a curtain.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.713
When are you going to understand this?

14:41.964 --> 14:45.384
Elena, love must be bold.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.720
Well, I'm not sure I should be bold.

14:47.803 --> 14:51.765
I've been told, by more than a few people,
that I'm "a lot."

14:52.808 --> 14:53.809
Who?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.978
Mostly you.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.067
It's always been easy for you guys.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.070
What if no one ever likes me?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.155
Ah.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.451
Well, it has not always been easy for me.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.410
What?

15:11.493 --> 15:13.829
Havana, 1958,

15:15.122 --> 15:20.336
I was madly in love with a young boy
from the country, Flavio.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.171
We were both 14.

15:23.005 --> 15:28.093
And he looked so majestic on that tractor,

15:29.720 --> 15:32.139
with a cigar dangling from his lips.

15:32.681 --> 15:37.686
And I, looking ravishing
with a cigar dangling from my lips.

15:38.729 --> 15:42.149
And one day I decided to let him know
of my feelings.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.903
And he laughed and he drove away.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.322
That's terrible.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.908
Oh, I was devastated.

15:51.825 --> 15:57.665
I salted the soil with my tears
and a beautiful rose grew there.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.335
-Really?
-It's a metaphor.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.546
But yes, really.

16:07.341 --> 16:12.680
And as I walked home,
I heard the healing sounds of the mambo

16:13.472 --> 16:17.601
and I followed my ears
to this little dance hall.

16:17.685 --> 16:21.105
And there is where I met Berto.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.608
So you're saying you never
would have met  Abuelito

16:24.692 --> 16:28.070
if you hadn't put yourself out there
and been rejected by Flavio?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.530
Exactly!

16:30.239 --> 16:33.909
Because in love,
you have to make yourself vulnerable.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.829
But it's just really hard.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.624
No. No,  mira,  this is what you do.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.876
You offer Dani a cookie.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.170
And if she doesn't want it,

16:45.254 --> 16:48.841
then it'll be like she's rejecting
the cookie, and not you.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.345
And for God's sake, who wants to be with
somebody who doesn't even want a cookie?

16:56.724 --> 16:57.599
Yeah.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.978
Maybe you're right.
I mean, it beats what I've been doing.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.982
Just staring awkwardly
and smelling her hair as she walks by.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.032
You could do better.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.745
[breathes deeply]

17:17.828 --> 17:18.871
Thanks,  Abuelita.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.793
That was really nice of you
to tell her that story,  Abuelita.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.588
Mentiras.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.092
That was my sister Maruchi's story,
and you know what?

17:32.176 --> 17:36.305
Frankly, I'm a little insulted that
you both believe that happened to me.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.354
-Hey!
-Hey. Hi. Hi.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.023
I was hoping I could bump into you.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.276
-[chuckles]
-Can I buy you dinner? Sun Chips? Funyuns?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.862
A single $6 Aspirin?

17:52.821 --> 17:53.947
God, they gouge you here.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.784
No, thanks. [chuckles]

17:56.867 --> 17:58.911
Then how about
I take you out on a real date?

17:58.994 --> 18:01.413
Somewhere classy,
where they make you pay for water.

18:05.459 --> 18:10.297
Listen, Max. What happened last night,
that's not me.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.175
I mean, it was me. I don't have,
like, a really sexy twin. [chuckles]

18:13.258 --> 18:14.343
But, um...

18:15.803 --> 18:17.179
I don't normally do that.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.847
Let's go back to this twin thing.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.724
I'm serious.

18:20.808 --> 18:25.521
So am I! That was a first for me.
I'm actually pretty old-fashioned.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.148
[scoffs] Yeah, right! Look at you.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.692
You're telling me you never
jumped into bed

18:30.776 --> 18:32.361
with some cute little car crash victim?

18:33.862 --> 18:36.740
Traffic accidents aren't the hook-up spots
you think they are.

18:38.408 --> 18:43.080
Actually, when Amber and I broke up,
it hit me like a ton of bricks.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.125
But, you know, after that,
I kind of threw myself into work.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.919
Look, last night was great.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.629
Even though we rushed into it...

18:51.922 --> 18:53.715
I've had a crush on you for like 15 years.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.509
Shut up!

18:57.553 --> 18:59.596
Yeah, no, it can never happen again.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.931
Why not?

19:01.014 --> 19:02.683
[stutters]

19:02.766 --> 19:05.853
I get, like, little chunks of 45 minutes
here and there.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.604
And I want more than a junk buddy.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.231
"Junk buddy"?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
Yeah, it's a thing.
Or maybe it's not a thing.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.779
I gotta be honest, I've got some
real idiots giving me advice.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.073
It sounds like it.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
Oh.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.328
All right. We've got a problem.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.747
'Cause I like you.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.333
But I don't want to do the hook-up thing,

19:28.917 --> 19:31.170
and I don't have time
for the romantic thing.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.797
So what do we do?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.340
[both exhale]

19:36.884 --> 19:38.051
I need a nap.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.888
Oh, damn, that was good.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.017
We ate an entire pizza in 17 minutes.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.229
And we managed to tell
two embarrassing stories from high school.

19:50.439 --> 19:54.651
I'm not sure going to all four
senior proms counts as embarrassing.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.529
-But this was fun.
-[laughs]

19:58.238 --> 20:01.325
-[sighs]
-Hey, come on, come on. Is this crazy?

20:01.867 --> 20:05.537
No! I mean, it's not ideal,

20:05.621 --> 20:08.665
but it's better than sitting in the
back of an ambulance, eating chili.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.501
Oh, pobrecito.  That is so sad.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.962
Well, it's an ambulance,
so I usually have company.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.840
I guess that's still sad.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.886
[Penelope sighs]

20:22.763 --> 20:24.973
So you'd really be okay with just
45 minutes a week?

20:25.766 --> 20:28.435
With you? I will take what I can get.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.438
Okay, but we have to keep this a secret

20:31.521 --> 20:34.816
'cause there's no way I can explain
to my mom and kids what this is.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.904
I'm gonna tell all my friends
'cause they'll get it.

20:40.447 --> 20:41.782
That's cool with me.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.242
[both laughing]

20:43.867 --> 20:45.702
-[Max sighs]
-Mmm. Okay.

20:46.745 --> 20:51.083
My kids will be home in 25 minutes.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get there.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.127
So what I'm hearing
is we got five minutes.

20:55.879 --> 20:59.258
Lucky for you,
I can do a lot in five minutes.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
I love these unisex shirts.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.138
Could use more blood though.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.016
[sniffs and sighs]

21:10.894 --> 21:13.188
Are you looking to get your courage up?

21:13.939 --> 21:15.482
Do you want a little rum?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.444
No! I don't even want to talk to her
until I know for sure that she's gay.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.696
Mmm.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.030
Wait, what are you doing?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.491
Excuse me, "she."

21:26.451 --> 21:28.328
What color lipstick are you wearing?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.872
Oh, I don't wear lipstick. Just ChapStick.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.208
Oh, nice!

21:33.292 --> 21:34.376
Gay.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.097
[cell phone buzzes]

21:47.180 --> 21:50.600
Ooh, my girlfriend's out front.
She hates when I make her wait.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.772
And she just bought me a cookie!
I love cookies!

22:02.112 --> 22:05.073
[chuckles] She has a girlfriend.
She's so lucky.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.870
Hey, uh, do you want to split that cookie?

22:10.620 --> 22:12.372
Huh? Wait.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.335
Oh...

22:17.502 --> 22:22.174
Oh, never mind. Uh, I thought... Sorry.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.260
-Sorry, sorry.
-No, no! Gay! Me, gay! [chuckles]

22:27.095 --> 22:30.515
Oh. Uh, me gay, too.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.982
-That's great.
-[both chuckle]

22:40.901 --> 22:41.735
Cookie?

22:44.571 --> 22:46.073
Uh...

22:46.698 --> 22:49.576
Yeah. She is terrible at this.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.789
Thank goodness she has us.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.965
-Mami,  don't get mad--
-What is it? What did you do?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.676
-I told you not to get mad!
-Which is the quickest way to make me mad!

23:06.760 --> 23:08.178
Okay, let me start again!

23:11.515 --> 23:13.100
So I've been talking to Syd...

23:14.351 --> 23:16.686
Syd? I thought you liked Dani.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.189
Dani is yesterday's news. Keep up!

23:21.108 --> 23:26.113
Anyway, I started talking to Syd
and I found out we have so much in common.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.281
And I know you're not crazy
about me dating,

23:28.365 --> 23:31.326
but I was just wondering
if I could get ice cream with them.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.038
And by "them," you mean just Syd?

23:35.622 --> 23:36.998
Yes! [chuckles]

23:37.082 --> 23:39.626
I'm at the top of my class,
and I finished all my homework, and--

23:39.709 --> 23:40.794
Yes.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.712
-Yes?
-Yes.

23:42.796 --> 23:46.091
But I have seven more reasons
why you should let me do this.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.093
Take yes for an answer.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.556
Being a good student is obviously
important, but it's not the only thing.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.016
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

23:55.100 --> 23:57.269
Yeah. Of course!

23:57.352 --> 23:59.396
It's important to make
a little time for romance.

23:59.479 --> 24:00.564
Otherwise, what are we doing?

24:00.647 --> 24:01.898
Mm-hmm.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.277
-[siren wailing]
-[inhales deeply and sighs]

24:07.904 --> 24:10.282
What? Now you like the sounds of sirens?

24:11.116 --> 24:15.036
Just the thought of an ambulance rushing
towards a body that needs attention.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.422
You work too hard.
