09:21.630 --> 09:23.588
(Ducks quack)

09:25.630 --> 09:28.005
(Woodpecker taps)

09:29.088 --> 09:30.880
- Need some alone time?

09:30.880 --> 09:33.047
- I... well, ahem.

09:33.047 --> 09:34.588
(Sighs)

09:35.755 --> 09:38.547
There's something wrong.

09:38.547 --> 09:41.005
With my thing.

09:42.630 --> 09:44.005
It hurts when I pee.

09:44.005 --> 09:47.463
- Well, it sounds like
you've got an STD.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.213
- No!
- I've got something.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.088
Here, here, hold! Hold.

09:51.088 --> 09:52.422
- Okay. (Water splashes)

09:53.630 --> 09:55.380
- (Chuckles)

09:56.547 --> 09:59.088
Where was this before
your STD, am I right?

09:59.088 --> 10:02.672
♪♪♪

10:02.672 --> 10:04.838
♪ Yeah, yeah
H-h-hands up ♪

10:04.838 --> 10:06.630
♪ Ha! Hey! ♪

10:08.338 --> 10:10.672
- Welcome to high tea, everyone.

10:10.672 --> 10:12.338
I trust you found your place

10:12.338 --> 10:14.255
according to my seating
arrangement.

10:17.797 --> 10:19.672
- She's finally eating
the crazy balls.

10:19.672 --> 10:21.963
Right, they're yummy, right?

10:21.963 --> 10:24.047
Because you can't have any
of those little sandwiches.

10:24.047 --> 10:26.588
- I've been told I look like
Lady Di.

10:26.588 --> 10:28.880
- Yeah, I see it.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.672
- Mabel?
- (Laboured breathing)

10:32.672 --> 10:34.672
Mabel honey, look at mummy.
Look at mummy, look at mummy.

10:34.672 --> 10:35.922
- (Wheezes)

10:35.922 --> 10:37.380
- What happened?
What's happening?

10:37.380 --> 10:39.922
- Her face is swelling up,
I've gotta get her EpiPen.

10:39.922 --> 10:42.297
- Oh, for-for real? Okay,
okay, it's okay. It's okay.

10:42.297 --> 10:44.672
Alicia: Mabel, are you okay?
(Mabel wheezes)

10:44.672 --> 10:47.005
Kate: Uh yes,
we'd like an ambulance.

10:47.005 --> 10:49.005
- Hi, it's okay, it's okay,
take a big, deep breath,

10:49.005 --> 10:50.255
I'm sure you're good.
- Mabel, you okay?

10:50.255 --> 10:51.630
- Do you have her EpiPen?

10:51.630 --> 10:53.797
- I don't know, it's always in
here, I always put it in here,

10:53.797 --> 10:55.713
I can't find it!
- It's okay.

10:55.713 --> 10:58.172
I'm just gonna take her, and
put her on the ground, okay?

10:58.172 --> 10:59.713
- Yeah.
- Oh, good girl.

10:59.713 --> 11:01.505
Kate: Yeah.
Anne: Good girl.

11:01.505 --> 11:03.588
- I'm gonna set you down.
- Okay, you're okay.

11:03.588 --> 11:06.255
- Does anyone have an EpiPen?
- We need an EpiPen!

11:06.255 --> 11:08.255
Alicia: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Anne: Good girl.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.130
(Birds chirp)

11:12.130 --> 11:16.588
- Uh, the raisins that I put
in those stupid crazy balls,

11:16.588 --> 11:19.172
I-I didn't check the bag
to see if they were nut free,

11:19.172 --> 11:22.213
and I was just so concerned
with making enough

11:22.213 --> 11:24.297
for everybody, and...

11:24.297 --> 11:26.505
(Sighs heavily)

11:27.547 --> 11:29.713
I almost killed my daughter!

11:29.713 --> 11:31.547
- Hey, we are gonna go
to the hospital,

11:31.547 --> 11:33.380
we're gonna get her a doctor's
examination.

11:34.422 --> 11:36.880
- Come on.
- You hear that? She's okay.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.838
- Yeah... yeah.

11:40.088 --> 11:43.880
You know, taking care of Mabel
is my only job, and...

11:46.338 --> 11:47.880
and I suck at it.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.005
- Alicia, you're an incredible
mother.

11:50.005 --> 11:52.172
If I got things right half
as often as you do,

11:52.172 --> 11:54.255
I wouldn't wanna strangle you
as much as I do.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.422
- (Laughs)

11:55.422 --> 11:57.005
- If it looks like we resent
you,

11:57.005 --> 11:59.130
it's just because you make us
look bad.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.005
(Mabel whimpers)
- (Sighs)

12:01.005 --> 12:02.630
- You're doing fine.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.630
- (Sighs tearfully)

12:09.963 --> 12:12.297
- I think I'm gonna go ahead
and cancel charades.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.797
- Wise choice, Val.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.838
- Let's take the rest
of the afternoon and relax.

12:15.838 --> 12:17.422
Childcare services
are available for anyone

12:17.422 --> 12:19.880
who would like it.
- Is there a bar here?

12:19.880 --> 12:21.547
- Yes, but I have something
even better.

12:21.547 --> 12:24.005
A big bottle of Pantyhose
Chardonnay.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.088
With all your names on it.

12:26.088 --> 12:28.297
Meet me back in my--
sorry, Ian.

12:28.297 --> 12:31.088
Our room. Last one in's
a rotten egg!

12:31.088 --> 12:32.422
(Giggles)

12:32.422 --> 12:34.130
Oh!

12:36.880 --> 12:38.380
- Miss Carlson?
- Yeah?

12:38.380 --> 12:40.838
- Your presence has been
requested at the hotel spa.

12:40.838 --> 12:42.338
- Oh. Thank you.

12:42.338 --> 12:44.338
- What's it say?

12:44.338 --> 12:47.297
- "For all you do,
this rub's for you.

12:47.297 --> 12:49.338
Smiley face. Love, Lionel."

12:49.338 --> 12:51.880
- Aw! I want a Lionel.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.380
- Huh. Yeah, he's pretty great.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.297
Minus the rhyming.

12:58.463 --> 13:00.422
(Water splashes, machine whirs)

13:03.588 --> 13:06.755
- Uh uh. No way,
what are you doing here?

13:06.755 --> 13:08.630
- Oh, hey.

13:08.630 --> 13:10.588
- Did you impersonate
my husband?

13:10.588 --> 13:12.463
- Pretty good, huh?
It's all in the rhyming.

13:13.463 --> 13:16.713
- Stop that.
- No! Dude, we're stuck here,

13:16.713 --> 13:18.547
we might as well get through
this together.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.547
(Sighs) If we can connect
with Alicia,

13:21.547 --> 13:24.838
you and I can connect too.
Please?

13:27.422 --> 13:30.463
- Fine.
- Kick those shoes off.

13:30.463 --> 13:32.963
Peter here will get
you calibrated.

13:32.963 --> 13:34.672
It's a little intimidating,
but...

13:34.672 --> 13:36.505
yeah, you're face down
with... yeah.

13:36.505 --> 13:38.172
(Buttons beep, whirring)

13:38.172 --> 13:40.213
Now, that thing's gonna close.

13:40.213 --> 13:42.630
This thing is 360 degrees
with its jets,

13:42.630 --> 13:44.838
and the best part, you don't
have to take your clothes off.

13:44.838 --> 13:46.463
- What if I wanna take
my clothes off?

13:46.463 --> 13:48.422
- Uh, we prefer you don't.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.755
(Buttons beep, whirring)

13:50.755 --> 13:52.547
(Water splashes)

13:53.630 --> 13:55.213
- See?

13:55.213 --> 13:57.838
- Okay, don't be an idiot
about it.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.338
This is magical.
- Yeah, man.

14:01.588 --> 14:04.213
- (Sighs comfortably)

14:04.213 --> 14:07.047
- Hey you, I just want
to apologize again.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.338
- Okay, enough. I get it, man.

14:10.338 --> 14:12.255
I just want you to listen
for once.

14:12.255 --> 14:14.213
Can you do that?
- Mhmm.

14:14.213 --> 14:16.713
Give me one sec. Psst!
Can we get--

14:16.713 --> 14:18.130
- Oh, yeah.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.922
- Man, working next to Brad
has been a trip.

14:19.922 --> 14:22.047
And not in a good way. Remember
that weird stranglehold

14:22.047 --> 14:24.880
he used to have over me?
- Totally, for sure I do.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.630
- Get this. He's turned into
a goddamn hypnotist.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.172
- Uh uh.
- Yeah.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.755
Legit, like, a real hypnotist.
- Uh uh.

14:31.755 --> 14:33.588
That's crazy.

14:33.588 --> 14:36.172
(Machine whirs)
Go on...

14:36.172 --> 14:37.922
Our exes think
we haven't changed a day

14:37.922 --> 14:40.380
since we broke up with them.
It's so stupid!

14:40.380 --> 14:43.005
- Stupid.
(Machine whirs)

14:43.005 --> 14:45.963
- Did you know he tried to
hypnotize me into not cumming?

14:45.963 --> 14:47.630
- (Laughs)
- Joke's on him.

14:47.630 --> 14:50.047
I've been at it every day,
and I've never cum harder.

14:50.047 --> 14:52.380
- Oh my god. (Grunts)

14:52.380 --> 14:54.922
- What was that?
(Machine whirs)

14:54.922 --> 14:56.588
- No. Yes! Oh...

14:57.672 --> 14:59.130
- Dude, are you cumming
right now?

14:59.130 --> 15:01.213
- I am, honestly,
don't look at me, oh god.

15:01.213 --> 15:02.630
Oh yeah!

15:02.630 --> 15:05.088
Do you wanna unplug it, maybe?
Unplug it, excuse me,

15:05.088 --> 15:07.838
unplug it, unplug it,
I'm sorry.

15:07.838 --> 15:10.838
Oh... oh yeah. Ohhhhhh...
(Buttons beep)

15:13.547 --> 15:15.755
Ohhh! (Laughs)

15:18.005 --> 15:20.922
Oh! I'm crying,
that was so powerful.

15:20.922 --> 15:24.172
Thank god it was you,
and not Val!

15:24.172 --> 15:26.172
Oh, those tan legs!

15:26.172 --> 15:29.338
Oh god. Yeah, that's... Anne?

15:29.338 --> 15:31.255
- Dude, that's really
fucked up!

15:31.255 --> 15:34.338
- Hey, I didn't mean to.
Oh, Jesus.

15:35.672 --> 15:37.630
Oh, thank you very much
for everything, sir.

15:37.630 --> 15:39.797
- Uh, you still have
nine minutes left.

15:39.797 --> 15:42.297
Do you wanna keep going?

15:42.297 --> 15:44.172
- No...?

15:45.922 --> 15:48.713
♪♪♪

15:48.713 --> 15:51.172

(Fireplace crackles)

15:54.172 --> 15:55.755
(Low hum of chatter)

15:57.338 --> 15:59.172
- Hey man, you okay?

15:59.172 --> 16:00.963
- Hey, uh...

16:00.963 --> 16:03.380
I think I have an STD.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.547
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.005
Are you sure it's not just me?

16:07.005 --> 16:08.588
I've been known to make penises
uncomfortable.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.297
- (Laughs)

16:10.297 --> 16:12.380
- Two shots of Patron,
my good man.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.463
- Ooh, tequila?
I don't know,

16:14.463 --> 16:16.088
I gotta sleep in a room
with Val.

16:16.088 --> 16:18.797
- Ah, you'll be okay.
Trust me.

16:18.797 --> 16:20.005
And don't worry
about your peen,

16:20.005 --> 16:22.880
they got all these creams
these days.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.213
(Sighs)

16:33.380 --> 16:35.463
Ooh...

16:35.463 --> 16:38.005
So, you're in a new
relationship?

16:38.005 --> 16:39.755
- Mhmm. Yeah.

16:39.755 --> 16:41.338
I do a lot for Dorothy,

16:41.338 --> 16:43.088
and she lets me sleep
in the guest wing.

16:43.088 --> 16:45.547
- Hm. So you-you work
for her,

16:45.547 --> 16:47.422
or you're living with her,

16:47.422 --> 16:49.338
or you're dating her?

16:49.338 --> 16:51.505
- Yeah, all of the above-ish.

16:51.505 --> 16:53.713
I don't know, to be honest.

16:55.422 --> 16:58.130
- Well, do you like her?
- Yeah, yeah. Totally.

16:59.463 --> 17:01.172
She's a bit creepy.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.172
It's like a sexy creep.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.963
Yeah, also she's-she's really
mature,

17:06.963 --> 17:09.005
makes me feel like
a kid sometimes.

17:09.005 --> 17:12.380
You know. I'm also dating
somebody way younger.

17:12.380 --> 17:15.880
So if you put them together,
they'd be like,

17:15.880 --> 17:17.505
the perfect woman.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.338
- Like, a 40 year old?

17:19.338 --> 17:21.963
- Yeah, basically.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.088
- What the hell?

17:31.588 --> 17:34.505
(Key card beeps, door thuds)

17:34.505 --> 17:36.755
Anne, are you in there?

17:36.755 --> 17:38.422
<i> Ian: Shh! Be quiet,</i>
<i> she can hear!</i>

17:38.422 --> 17:39.672
<i> (Anne giggles) You quiet!</i>

17:39.672 --> 17:41.588
- Dude, I can hear you
in there!

17:41.588 --> 17:43.547
Seriously?
You're kicking me out?

17:43.547 --> 17:45.338
- You did it to yourself.

17:45.338 --> 17:47.297
- It's not my fault
you didn't get to cum!

17:47.297 --> 17:48.797
(Door slams)

17:50.588 --> 17:52.547
- Wait, did she say cum?

17:52.547 --> 17:54.630
You guys aren't...

17:54.630 --> 17:57.172
- What?! No!
- (Laughs)

17:59.672 --> 18:01.922
- What the fuck was that?

18:01.922 --> 18:03.838
- Sorry, I got carried away.

18:03.838 --> 18:05.713
Seriously though, I can't thank
you enough for saving me

18:05.713 --> 18:08.380
from a night with Val.
She's so inappropriate.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.088
- Yeah, of course she is.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.797
- She asked me to help her
shave her legs.

18:11.797 --> 18:13.755
Like, I know her wrist hurts
or whatever,

18:13.755 --> 18:15.838
but I could swear
she's right handed.

18:15.838 --> 18:18.297
- (Laughs)

18:18.297 --> 18:20.588
I just needed a breather,
you know?

18:20.588 --> 18:23.297
Female friendship
is at best complicated.

18:24.422 --> 18:26.130
Like, it's refreshing
how the biggest thing

18:26.130 --> 18:28.630
you have to figure out is...
who gave you that STD.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.130
No offense.
- Mhmm...

18:31.588 --> 18:33.380
- Is yours coming off?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.797
- Ah! No.

18:36.797 --> 18:39.255
And the thing is...

18:39.255 --> 18:41.588
I've only done it with one
person since Jenny.

18:44.797 --> 18:47.338
Can you? Thanks.
- Mhmm, yep.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.213
It only takes one person,
so it's either your new girl,

18:52.213 --> 18:54.630
or it's Jenny.
- What?

18:54.630 --> 18:56.172
(Ripping)

18:57.338 --> 18:59.505
Aaaaah!

18:59.505 --> 19:01.172
(Pained sighs)

19:02.297 --> 19:05.297
What? Is it-is it nice?
- Mhmm...

19:08.505 --> 19:09.963
(Elevator dings)

19:13.005 --> 19:15.422
(Knocking)

19:15.422 --> 19:17.088
- Hi.
- Oh hi, honey.

19:18.088 --> 19:20.463
Hi Kate, how did things go
with Anne?

19:20.463 --> 19:22.130
- Not good, can I stay here?

19:22.130 --> 19:24.172
- Oh, no can do, I offered
the extra space to Jade,

19:24.172 --> 19:26.297
there's a toilet problem
in her room.

19:26.297 --> 19:27.755
I'd totally invite you to hang,

19:27.755 --> 19:29.588
but she was really explicit
about not wanting to deal

19:29.588 --> 19:31.422
with anyone's bullshit.

19:31.422 --> 19:33.297
Those are her words,
they were not mine.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.338
Jade: No bullshit!
- Mm, no worries,

19:35.338 --> 19:37.380
I'm sure we'll find another
option. Thanks, man.

19:37.380 --> 19:38.755
- Okay.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.755
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

19:40.755 --> 19:42.463
- Good job, Charlie.

19:42.463 --> 19:44.380
All right, buddy,
we will get through this.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.713
(Sighs)

19:51.088 --> 19:53.505
(Knocking)
- Kate!

19:53.505 --> 19:55.755
Have you seen Ian?

19:55.755 --> 19:57.797
I did turn down service
on his bed.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.922
- Yeah, he uh, made another
arrangement.

20:00.922 --> 20:03.255
Can we stay with you tonight?
- Yes!

20:03.255 --> 20:04.713
- Okay.

20:06.380 --> 20:07.588
- I know what you're thinking,

20:07.588 --> 20:09.463
and yes, there's more.

20:09.463 --> 20:12.463
You don't need a mani, do you?
I brought decals.

20:12.463 --> 20:14.005
- That's nice, but I would
really just love

20:14.005 --> 20:16.172
to get some sleep.

20:16.172 --> 20:18.547
- Of course.
- Well, thank you.

20:18.547 --> 20:20.755
- Waste of my goddamn time.
- Sorry, what was that?

20:20.755 --> 20:21.838
- Huh? Nothing.
