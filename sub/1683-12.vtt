00:00.600 --> 00:04.103
Previously on sleepy hollow...
Abbie: <i>Me and my sister jenny,</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:06.005
<i>We're walking home,</i>
<i>all of a sudden,</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:07.773
<i>There were</i>
<i>these four white trees.</i>

00:07.775 --> 00:09.108
<i>And we blacked out.</i>

00:09.110 --> 00:10.943
What happened to my son?

00:10.945 --> 00:13.679
<i>The sisterhood bound together</i>
<i>and invoked a hex</i>

00:13.681 --> 00:16.682
<i>To stop his heart.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:18.283
Ichabod, this place
I've been trapped in,

00:18.285 --> 00:19.451
It's purgatory.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.986
I will free you from this hell.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.454
<i>We will defeat moloch,</i>

00:22.456 --> 00:23.789
And we will be
together again.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.491
My soul doesn't belong
to me anymore.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.860
How do I know
I can even trust you?
You can't.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.129
I retain what I see
with near perfect precision.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.363
You have photographic memory?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.465
Irving: <i>I can't let anything</i>
<i>happen to macey.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:36.035
Daddy.
Be gone, satan!

00:37.637 --> 00:39.872
What the hell do you want?
<i>How did george washington's</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:41.507
<i>Bible get buried with you?</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:42.975
Do you know what's special
about it?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.810
The answers are
in washington's bible!

00:44.812 --> 00:45.978
This is
in washington's own hand.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.679
Abbie:
According to the history books,

00:47.681 --> 00:49.882
Washington died December 14.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.985
Four days before he wrote this.

00:52.987 --> 00:53.886
How is that possible?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.822
That is what we must discover.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.057
Crane (recorded):
<i>Good day.</i>

00:58.059 --> 00:59.892
<i>This is captain ichabod crane,</i>
<i>esquire.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:01.160
<i>If you will be so kind,</i>
<i>please leave</i>

01:01.162 --> 01:02.661
<i>Your name, rank and an address</i>

01:02.663 --> 01:04.863
Where I may reach you, and I
will return this correspondence

01:04.865 --> 01:07.032
In a timely manner.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.033
And now what do I press?

01:08.035 --> 01:10.069
Pound? What's pound?

01:10.071 --> 01:10.903
(beep)

01:10.905 --> 01:12.671
Crane...

01:12.673 --> 01:15.340
Witness one paging witness two.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.676
I've been thinking
about this page we found

01:17.678 --> 01:18.510
In washington's bible.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.845
I made a couple calls

01:19.847 --> 01:21.547
To people I know at quantico.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.183
We can send the page
to their carbon dating lab,

01:24.185 --> 01:27.419
Which will give us a better idea
of exactly when it was written.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.687
See you at work.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.023
I am...

01:31.025 --> 01:33.092
Respectfully, lieutenant mills.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.696
There's no way
he's getting that message.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.432
(sighs)
(phone chimes)

01:40.434 --> 01:43.602
Well... Look at you.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.071
"more telescope conception?"

01:46.073 --> 01:46.905
(chuckles)

01:46.907 --> 01:48.907
"store cellophane recession?"

01:48.909 --> 01:51.076
(phone chiming)

01:51.078 --> 01:53.045
"poor telephone reception."

01:53.047 --> 01:56.381
(laughs)
there you go.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.916
(beep)

01:57.918 --> 01:59.017
Oh...

02:02.088 --> 02:03.155
(floorboard creaking)

02:10.296 --> 02:11.897
Hi, abbie.

02:11.899 --> 02:16.268
We need to talk
about boundaries.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.570
(birds chirping)

02:18.572 --> 02:22.407
December 18, 1799.

02:22.409 --> 02:26.311
It's not a birthday,
not an anniversary.

02:28.114 --> 02:31.750
This date was important to you,
general washington.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.620
But why?

02:34.622 --> 02:39.091
What happened four days
after you died?

02:39.093 --> 02:40.692
(phone beeping)

02:42.929 --> 02:44.763
(beep)

02:44.765 --> 02:50.169
"on my way.
Colon closed parenthesis."

02:51.104 --> 02:52.004
Oh.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.639
It's a man's face.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.075
I suppose that's... Charming.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.979
Oh, my dear general,

03:00.981 --> 03:03.682
What is it you want me to see?

03:07.487 --> 03:09.521
Washington:
Captain crane.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.622
General washington.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.090
Welcome back.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.626
Washington:
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>

03:14.628 --> 03:17.162
<i>What the future holds, crane.</i>

03:17.164 --> 03:18.964
<i>It is most likely</i>
<i>that you will be called upon</i>

03:18.966 --> 03:22.634
<i>To continue this fight</i>
<i>when others cannot.</i>

03:22.636 --> 03:24.203
<i>And when that time comes,</i>

03:24.205 --> 03:26.305
Good will always

03:26.307 --> 03:28.140
Rise...

03:28.142 --> 03:30.375
Like lazarus

03:30.377 --> 03:32.544
From his grave.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.646
Lazarus.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.114
In john...

03:40.987 --> 03:43.822
General washington.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.724
Always elbow-shaking.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.031
What are you
doing here, andy?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.367
Came here
to ask you something.

03:55.369 --> 03:59.037
If you're here because moloch
wants washington's bible...

03:59.039 --> 04:00.672
He doesn't want the bible.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.374
He wants a map.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.176
That bible has
instructions on how

04:04.178 --> 04:06.411
To get it.
What would moloch
get from a map?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.013
It's not what he can get
with the map.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.848
It's what you and crane
can use it for.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.017
Moloch is not gonna give up.
He's sending

04:12.019 --> 04:13.018
His soldiers after you.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.420
Abbie,
if you give me the bible...

04:15.422 --> 04:17.089
Are you kidding me?
Hear me out.
If you can get me

04:17.091 --> 04:21.426
That bible, then I promise you
you'll be spared

04:21.428 --> 04:24.029
And you'll be awarded
a high seat in his new order.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.698
So if I turn my back
on the world and crane,

04:26.700 --> 04:29.334
I'll get a better view
of the apocalypse?

04:30.937 --> 04:32.371
Sorry.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.239
No deal.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.907
(dialing)
please don't risk

04:35.909 --> 04:38.243
Your life to protect
ichabod crane.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.712
(line ringing)
crane. Come on, pick up.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.081
Crane will give your soul to
moloch-- it is prophesied.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.284
Crane:
<i>Moloch.</i>

04:45.286 --> 04:47.719
He's coming for your soul.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.455
He says I will
deliver it to him.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.124
He will desert you.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.925
Just like your parents.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.428
Just like everyone
you have ever loved.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.063
Except me.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.431
No one loves you

04:59.433 --> 05:02.167
Like I do.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.608
Andy, listen to me...

05:09.610 --> 05:11.610
No.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.179
No, I don't want
to hear you say it.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.486
Trust me, this is for the best.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.487
(dialing)

05:22.489 --> 05:24.623
(line ringing)

05:24.625 --> 05:26.591
This is
lieutenant mills...

05:26.593 --> 05:27.926
(crack)

05:27.928 --> 05:29.795
...For the captain.
Please tell him

05:29.797 --> 05:30.929
It's an emergency.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.699
(handcuffs clanking)
(door opens)

05:46.612 --> 05:49.948
So... I had a busy morning.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.783
As did I.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.486
Of course... Ladies first.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.956
For starters, when I call,
I need you to pick up.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.958
I believe I would have an easier
time navigating my device

05:59.960 --> 06:03.462
Were it not such a--
how shall I say this--

06:03.464 --> 06:04.463
An antiquated

06:04.465 --> 06:06.031
Piece of rubbish.
What's wrong

06:06.033 --> 06:06.798
With your phone?

06:06.800 --> 06:10.035
It's obsolete.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.970
I'm not blaming you, lieutenant.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.972
It's these telecommunication
companies, overwhelming

06:13.974 --> 06:17.175
The populace with their
ostentatious advertisements.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.812
They're coercing the consumer
into purchasing countless

06:20.814 --> 06:22.347
"system updates."

06:22.349 --> 06:23.982
It's an abuse
of capitalism

06:23.984 --> 06:25.884
And certainly not the vision
behind our...

06:25.886 --> 06:28.019
Laissez-faire market.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.989
Hmm. And yet...
You want a new one?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.924
You've got one.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.360
Okay, I hear you.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.162
How 'bout this.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.997
You can have my phone
for a couple of days.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.533
If you actually use it,
I'll get you the same one.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.736
Shall we... Seal this accord?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.006
Not to bury the lede,

06:48.008 --> 06:51.343
But andy brooks came
to my house.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.678
For what purpose?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.380
I don't know anymore.
Because he loves me?

06:55.382 --> 06:57.182
'cause he's trying
to manipulate me?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.583
He said moloch

06:58.585 --> 07:00.252
Is unleashing soldiers on us.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.021
He's been after the bible
because it leads to a map.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.158
A map.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.261
What else?

07:09.263 --> 07:13.064
He repeated the same prophecy
that moloch told you.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.100
That you'd give
up my soul,

07:15.102 --> 07:17.202
That we were destined
to turn on each other.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.069
Poppycock.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.138
I know.

07:23.543 --> 07:27.145
And yet you don't seem
so certain anymore.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.215
It's not you.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.385
Brooks knows about
my family, my history.

07:33.387 --> 07:37.155
I think it's just...
Screwing with my head a little.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.725
So... As I was poring

07:40.727 --> 07:43.562
Over the bible, I was thinking
of washington's words to me

07:43.564 --> 07:46.765
Some months before I...
Fell on the battlefield.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.100
He referenced the story
of lazarus.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.769
So I reread it

07:50.771 --> 07:53.071
In washington's bible,

07:53.073 --> 07:55.440
Searching for clues.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.409
The story of
lazarus is usually

07:57.411 --> 07:59.244
57 verses long.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.479
In this bible,

08:00.481 --> 08:01.813
It's 67.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.981
Precisely.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.917
These ten false verses
are likely encoded

08:05.919 --> 08:08.520
With a secret message
from washington.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.492
It still feels weird

08:13.494 --> 08:14.926
Tampering with a bible.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.496
Thomas jefferson took a scalpel
to his copy of the gospels.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.770
"December 18,

08:25.772 --> 08:28.440
"1799.

08:28.442 --> 08:31.443

president george washington

08:31.445 --> 08:35.981

08:35.983 --> 08:38.984
"dear sir,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.186
"then the war
has resumed

08:41.188 --> 08:43.822
And your destiny
to bear witness made manifest."

08:43.824 --> 08:45.957
Washington knew
you were a witness.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.125
One of the
many secrets

08:47.127 --> 08:48.693
He kept hidden from me.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.631
"four days ago, I was diagnosed
by dr. William thornton

08:52.633 --> 08:55.967
"with a fatal case of...

08:55.969 --> 08:57.802
"croup and quinsy.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.137

08:59.139 --> 09:00.639
"I drafted a plan.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.974
"I asked that my body be kept

<i>"preserved</i>

09:05.212 --> 09:07.145
<i>"so that supernatural forces</i>

<i>"might aid me</i>

09:09.016 --> 09:12.050
<i>"four days ago, I died.</i>

09:12.052 --> 09:15.220
<i>"but through the cursed prayer</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:16.521
<i>I was resurrected."</i>

09:16.523 --> 09:18.990
(gasps)

09:18.992 --> 09:21.159
My god.
You and I
have seen

09:21.161 --> 09:24.229
A lot of crazy stuff,
but... Zombie george washington,

09:24.231 --> 09:25.897
That takes the cake.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.000
"and so my final mission

09:29.002 --> 09:31.736
"was to skirt the icy bonds
of death

09:31.738 --> 09:34.506
"and resurrect myself.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.875
<i>"as I existed, then,</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:39.010

<i>I could bring information</i>

09:39.012 --> 09:40.879
<i>"from one into the other,</i>

09:40.881 --> 09:43.048
"so that I could

09:43.050 --> 09:44.382
"a map

09:44.384 --> 09:45.850
<i>"charting the passage</i>

09:45.852 --> 09:47.352

09:47.354 --> 09:49.020
Abbie:
<i>"an indispensable weapon</i>

09:49.022 --> 09:51.089
Against the evils of war."

09:51.091 --> 09:54.926
If we can find that map...

09:54.928 --> 09:57.095
I can free my wife

09:57.097 --> 09:59.097
<i>From purgatory.</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:40.105
Evil could want this map
for any number of reasons.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.708
Our priority has to be
getting it before they do.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.145
I know you want
to free katrina.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.715
Try not to let that
cloud your judgment.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.786
If you promise not
to let the inane prophecy

10:54.788 --> 10:56.655
Offered by our enemy,
mr. Brooks,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.657
Cloud yours.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.092
This is about defeating moloch.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.995
Glad we agree.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.998
Shall we seal this accord?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.601
Are there any more clues
from the bible

11:09.603 --> 11:11.936
On where this map
to purgatory might be?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.171
The index

11:13.173 --> 11:16.941
In washington's letter
offers a list of names of people

11:16.943 --> 11:19.611
Involved with the reanimation.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.680
Alfred knapp.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.447
Reverend knapp?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.682
We don't have much time.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.451
A warlock allied with katrina.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.687
<i>He guarded the horseman's head</i>

11:28.689 --> 11:29.754
For two centuries.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.458
Worked out well for him.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.860
This index states
that he was present

11:35.862 --> 11:37.362
At the resurrection.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.832
The prayer beads they used--

11:40.834 --> 11:42.967
They must have been his.

11:42.969 --> 11:46.971
Washington's letter said
that those beads are cursed.

11:46.973 --> 11:50.809
To imbue religious instruments
with such dark forces would be

11:50.811 --> 11:51.976
An ungodly act.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.480
Those beads would be full
of sin.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.148
If we can find
reverend knapp's

11:57.150 --> 11:59.150
Prayer beads,

11:59.152 --> 12:01.820
Perhaps our mr. Parish
can read their history

12:01.822 --> 12:05.557
And discover what the late
reverend knew of this map.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.861
Let's call in
our sin eater.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.730
Man: <i>You gave the order</i>
<i>to move your family</i>

12:11.732 --> 12:14.165
To a safe house based
on a threat to your daughter.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.168
Any idea why a threat to you
and your family would murder

12:17.170 --> 12:18.737
A cop and a priest?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.171
(gruff, distorted):
Deliver washington's bible.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.040
No.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.042
Well, did you know that
detective morales was...?

12:24.044 --> 12:25.944
Thank you, detective nunez.
That'll be all.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.349
Frank...

12:31.351 --> 12:33.351
I sent you out here.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.186
You're my guy, so,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.589
Why don't I know what's going on
in sleepy hollow?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.557
I have told you...
Everything I know.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.192
No. You've been

12:41.194 --> 12:42.927
On my side of the table.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.696
You know I need answers, frank.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.097
For these murders,

12:46.099 --> 12:47.599
For the beheadings, all of it.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.867
Detective morales...

12:48.869 --> 12:51.102
Morales is not the answer.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.708
Then who the hell is?

12:56.710 --> 12:58.076
Evil.

12:58.078 --> 12:58.943
What?

12:58.945 --> 13:02.080
Did you just
say "evil"?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.149
Yeah, tom, I did.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.556
I was weak.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.625
I failed you.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.894
(moloch laughing)

13:15.896 --> 13:18.429
Moloch:
You <i>are</i> weak.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.900
Take me seriously!

13:21.902 --> 13:23.968
(moloch laughing)

13:28.641 --> 13:32.243
Please... Make me your weapon.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.113
I will fight in your army.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.482
I will burn the world!

13:37.484 --> 13:40.885
Moloch:
Loyalty demands proof.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.556
Find me the map.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.165
(insects chirping
and trilling)

13:57.770 --> 13:59.637
(gasps, groans)

13:59.639 --> 14:01.773
(loud chirping and trilling)

14:01.775 --> 14:04.108
(grunting)

14:04.110 --> 14:05.276
No!

14:05.278 --> 14:07.512
(screams)

14:07.514 --> 14:10.014
(gasping)

14:11.684 --> 14:14.686
All of the dreams
katrina and I shared

14:14.688 --> 14:16.521
Can now be made real.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.623
<i>This may not be</i>

14:18.625 --> 14:20.792
The future we envisioned,

14:20.794 --> 14:24.696
But it will be ours
to fashion as we wish.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.331
<i>She is my guiding light.</i>

14:26.333 --> 14:28.166
I love you, ichabod.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.168
Crane:
<i>The guardian of my soul.</i>

14:30.170 --> 14:31.469
<i>And when we are reunited,</i>

14:31.471 --> 14:34.138
I will cherish her
as never before.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.306
(phone chimes)

14:35.308 --> 14:36.808
Siri:
I don't know what that means.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.344
If you like,
I can search the web for,

14:39.346 --> 14:41.880
"I will cherish her
as never before."

14:41.882 --> 14:44.182
Yolanda was
a much better listener.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.484
Searching for "yolanda."

14:46.486 --> 14:47.986
Farewell.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.153
Parish:
Mr. Crane?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.556
Mr. Parish.
Thank you for coming.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.157
Now where are

14:53.159 --> 14:54.359
These prayer beads?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.060
Follow me.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.002
If we're correct,
these beads will point us

15:04.004 --> 15:05.270
To the map's location.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.208
Abbie:
According to church records,

15:10.210 --> 15:13.211
Knapp asked to be entombed
with his body parts intact

15:13.213 --> 15:15.580
And his prayer beads
around his neck.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.081
Rather well preserved.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.650
Health benefits
of being a warlock.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.020
Crane:
Remarkable stitching.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.688
An old flame
of mine was a seamstress.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.856
She'd be most impressed.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.224
Who did you date, betsy ross?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.092
How did you know that?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.127
You serious?!

15:34.533 --> 15:35.867
(groaning)

15:35.869 --> 15:39.370
There is sin
within this artifact.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.705
The sin of defying

15:40.707 --> 15:42.907
God himself by cheating death.

15:42.909 --> 15:47.378
These beads were indeed
used for something...

15:47.380 --> 15:50.315
(whispers):
...Most unnatural.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.218
(sizzling, groaning)

15:54.220 --> 15:55.720
(gasping)

15:55.722 --> 15:56.888
Oh!

15:56.890 --> 15:58.623
Mr. Parish?

15:59.925 --> 16:02.060
My god.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.262
There must be a hex
on these beads.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.563
Parish:
It appears

16:05.565 --> 16:09.500
This might be harder
than I first imagined.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.912
Crane:
These beads are guarded,

16:20.914 --> 16:22.914
Mostly likely to prevent
an intrusion such as this.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.248
Abbie
great.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.417
Dead warlock
with a security system.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.919
Parish:
I hadn't anticipated

16:27.921 --> 16:30.922
Any kind of resistance.

16:30.924 --> 16:34.592
In fact, I've never felt
anything quite like this.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.928
And that concludes our latest
adventures in grave-robbing.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.930
I said this wasn't anticipated.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.099
I didn't say it was impossible.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.101
Look at your hand.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.502
That hex hurt you.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.970
We have no idea

16:45.972 --> 16:48.106
What other protections
there are in place.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.609
We will find another way...
Mr. Parish.

16:51.611 --> 16:56.014
These prayer beads are
protecting valuable secrets.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.517
I can feel them
trying to escape.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.985
We had to know that

17:00.987 --> 17:04.956
Finding a map to purgatory
wouldn't be that easy.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.657
But if it helps you
to retrieve your wife,

17:06.659 --> 17:08.826
And us to win this war,

17:08.828 --> 17:12.463
Then it is a task

17:12.465 --> 17:15.033
That I am ready to embrace.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.973
(groaning, sizzling)

17:21.975 --> 17:23.274
Mr. Parish!

17:25.544 --> 17:26.978
(gasps, yelling)

17:26.980 --> 17:28.980
Crane:
Henry!

17:28.982 --> 17:30.481
(gasps)

17:30.483 --> 17:31.883
Henry.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.155
I saw...

17:37.157 --> 17:40.158
Washington come to life.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.159
(gasps)

17:41.161 --> 17:42.994
And knapp...

17:42.996 --> 17:45.797
<i>By a shoreline,</i>
<i>carrying something.</i>

17:49.868 --> 17:53.404
I'm sorry I couldn't get more.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.672
(trembling breath)

17:54.674 --> 17:56.407
I tried.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.577
I just need a moment.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.012
Let me assist you.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.147
I said, leave me alone!

18:05.417 --> 18:07.685
Please.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.087
Abbie:
Crane,

18:09.089 --> 18:10.254
Give him a minute.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.963
(groans, panting)

18:20.732 --> 18:21.933
We shouldn't
have let him do that.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.368
Parish is a man capable of
making his own decisions.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.871
Maybe we need
to rethink everything.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.706
Absolutely. Wait.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.741
What do you mean, "everything"?

18:30.743 --> 18:34.045
As in, maybe this map
shouldn't be found.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.546
I realize the dangers,
lieutenant.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.415
Do you? Because I don't.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.284
And I know just as much
about this map as you.
I have to believe

18:40.286 --> 18:42.620
That washington left it for me
because I am a witness,

18:42.622 --> 18:45.890
So I can free katrina
and end this war.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.392
Then why did knapp put a hex
on the beads

18:48.394 --> 18:51.429
So that <i>no one</i> could learn
its secrets?

18:51.431 --> 18:53.731
Where was the heads up
on that? Crane,

18:53.733 --> 18:55.733
Henry could have been killed!

18:55.735 --> 18:57.902
What are you implying?

18:57.904 --> 18:58.936
That in the 200 years

18:58.938 --> 19:01.105
That you were underground,
the plan changed.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.740
It was a really
long time ago.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.575
Who's to say
that if we use this map

19:04.577 --> 19:06.744
And free katrina...

19:06.746 --> 19:09.147
There won't be ramifications
beyond our control,

19:09.149 --> 19:11.749
Beyond what washington
anticipated?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.484
If entering

19:13.486 --> 19:16.988
Purgatory somehow opens
the floodgates...

19:16.990 --> 19:18.756
It would be armageddon.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.525
That is what I am thinking.

19:31.503 --> 19:35.439
Crane, I know how badly
you want her back.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.942
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do

19:37.944 --> 19:41.646
For another hour with my mom,
patrol ride with corbin.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.447
But if the day ever comes

19:43.449 --> 19:47.118
Where you have to choose
between the greater good

19:47.120 --> 19:49.020
And katrina,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.789
If it ever comes to that,

19:51.791 --> 19:55.026
Are you willing
to sacrifice her freedom?

19:56.862 --> 19:59.964
'cause, to me, that's what
this whole fight is all about.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.967
What are we willing
to do to keep

20:02.969 --> 20:06.370
Everyone, everything safe?

20:10.175 --> 20:12.610
(panting)

20:17.015 --> 20:20.051
(raspy breathing)

20:20.986 --> 20:22.386
(roaring)

20:23.655 --> 20:25.823
Look out!

20:25.825 --> 20:27.058
(gunshot)

20:31.830 --> 20:34.065
No!

20:34.067 --> 20:35.600
(screeching)

20:41.173 --> 20:42.940
Henry!

20:44.176 --> 20:45.676
(groans)

20:45.678 --> 20:46.978
(hisses)

20:48.847 --> 20:50.815
(screeching)

21:01.026 --> 21:03.928
Crane: Moloch sent those
creatures to stop us.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.067
You're right,
lieutenant.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.402
This map is more dangerous

21:11.404 --> 21:13.104
Than perhaps even washington
could have imagined.

21:17.042 --> 21:20.011
We must find it,
or this war will be lost.

21:27.386 --> 21:31.222
I can cross "fighting a demon"
from my bucket list.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.958
Safe to say...

21:33.960 --> 21:35.893
That hex was in place
for good reason.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.396
Mainly stopping moloch
from gaining any information.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.965
I'm sorry I didn't
learn anything of value.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.400
Seems knapp

21:42.402 --> 21:45.303
Has taken the map's location
to his grave.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.306
Of course.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.473
The masons urge
their brethren

21:49.475 --> 21:52.410
To take their secrets with them
into death.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.978
It's a rite dating back

21:53.980 --> 21:55.613
To the pharaohs of egypt.
And washington,

21:55.615 --> 21:56.914
Being a mason,

21:56.916 --> 21:59.650
Never would have wanted the map
far from his remains.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.285
Reverend knapp
would have been ordered

22:01.287 --> 22:03.321
To bury the map with washington.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.090
There are two different

22:06.092 --> 22:07.658
Grave sites at mt. Vernon

22:07.660 --> 22:10.928
And a tomb at the capitol
that has never been used.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.264
Two different recorded
birthdays, two different wills,

22:13.266 --> 22:14.932
Three different grave sites.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.269
Decoy chapters in the bible.
Why not decoy grave sites?

22:18.271 --> 22:19.970
Washington would've wanted
to be buried

22:19.972 --> 22:23.541
Near sleepy hollow,
somewhere knapp could protect.

22:24.443 --> 22:25.943
Mr. Parish.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.111
Yes.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.980
In those brief glimpses
you read from the beads,

22:29.982 --> 22:33.951
Did you see anything that might
resemble a burial site?

22:33.953 --> 22:35.486
Well...

22:35.488 --> 22:38.956
Knapp was by a shoreline.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.926
<i>He was transporting something.</i>

22:47.866 --> 22:49.567
A body.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.969
Knapp was moving a body.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.337
Many a mickle makes a muckle.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.706
Come again?
It's something
washington used to say.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.043
Several small parts
add up to a greater whole.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.979
Knapp was ferrying washington's
body to a secret burial site.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.382
Now, there are
21 different islands

23:04.384 --> 23:05.983
Along the hudson river.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.818
Then let's figure out
which one he went to.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.221
We find washington's grave--
his real grave--

23:10.223 --> 23:12.723
And we shall find the map
buried with him.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.302
(crackling)

23:33.545 --> 23:35.279
(grunting)

23:37.516 --> 23:38.983
(yells)

23:57.903 --> 23:59.103
(yells)

24:02.707 --> 24:05.709
(deep voice):
I am your servant!

24:05.711 --> 24:08.913
Moloch shall rise.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.283
And all his enemies will fall.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.888
Abbie:
This is bannerman's island.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.558
Washington used it
as a penal colony.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.461
It's a good bet
this is where knapp buried him.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.834
(phone chiming)

24:33.638 --> 24:35.973
Infuriating.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.276
I can't get my maps
app to triangulate.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.245
(phone chimes)
oh, but I can
still receive updates

24:41.247 --> 24:43.747
For your so-called
"social network."

24:43.749 --> 24:45.916
And how is it you
have 500 friends?

24:45.918 --> 24:47.117
I had only seven

24:47.119 --> 24:49.320
Close companions--
four of them died.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.088
Those were good odds.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.458
We use the term "friend"
more loosely these days.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.960
Aristotle would be
most unimpressed.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.294
Yeah, well,
he's dead, too.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.929
I pulled this from the archives.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.799
It should help us figure out
where this grave might be.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.802
No. As detailed as these may be,

25:04.804 --> 25:07.438
It will not show you
the masonic secrets used

25:07.440 --> 25:09.173
To hide a crypt's location,

25:09.175 --> 25:10.608
Especially one
as invaluable as washington's.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.810
All I need is

25:12.812 --> 25:14.111
One hour on this island.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.614
I'll find out where the grave
and the map are located.

25:16.616 --> 25:20.284
I'm on board with that,
but once we get the map,

25:20.286 --> 25:23.487
We need to talk
about how we should handle it.

25:23.489 --> 25:27.124
Yes. We will assay
how best to keep it safe.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.693
No matter how dangerous.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.362
Or tempting.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.598
That's what oppenheimer said
about the manhattan project.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.867
He created the nuclear bomb,

25:36.869 --> 25:38.636
A weapon that leveled parts
of japan,

25:38.638 --> 25:40.504
And, frankly, could
still end the world

25:40.506 --> 25:43.707
If the devices got
into the wrong hands.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.378
And what about when they were
in the right hands?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.613
It ended a world war.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.900
(clears throat)

26:09.902 --> 26:13.170
I know this is crazy,
but I... I need to ask.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.738
In all of
your research,

26:14.740 --> 26:17.675
Have you ever heard
of a prophecy in which

26:17.677 --> 26:19.410
One of the witnesses
renounces the other?

26:19.412 --> 26:22.846
There is a prophecy buried deep
in the apocryphon of john,

26:22.848 --> 26:25.683
A testament rejected
from the bible.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.253
Uh, "I will give my power
to two witnesses,

26:29.255 --> 26:33.223
"and they shall prophesy
for 1,260 days.

26:33.225 --> 26:38.028
"but when the beast
comes up from the abyss,

26:38.030 --> 26:40.030
"a witness will surrender
a witness.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.166
And neither will survive."

26:42.901 --> 26:45.536
So it's true.

26:45.538 --> 26:48.105
Crane might turn on me.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.373
If you believe in prophesy.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.942
You've known this whole time.
As I said,

26:51.944 --> 26:55.112
It was rejected by those
who transcribed the bible.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.581
It's impossible to
gauge its veracity.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.051
Sometimes a story is just
a story, miss mills.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.587
Evil believes that story.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.756
In fact, they're counting on it.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.391
A word of advice:

27:07.393 --> 27:10.060
Prophecies have a nasty way
of fulfilling themselves

27:10.062 --> 27:12.129
If you let them.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.499
Crane:
Over here!

27:24.409 --> 27:27.311
That rock in the clearing.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.246
Would that be
your masonic marker?

27:29.248 --> 27:31.582
Does an alderman have
an unwarranted self-regard?

27:31.584 --> 27:33.917
I don't even know
how to answer that.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.719
You think washington's
buried here.

27:36.955 --> 27:37.821
And how do we get in?

27:37.823 --> 27:39.923
Beveled edges

27:39.925 --> 27:42.126
Facing... North.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.728
Clockwise.

27:46.097 --> 27:48.265
Abbie:
Let me help.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.267
Thank you.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.837
(both grunting)

27:59.644 --> 28:01.945
Right.

28:01.947 --> 28:03.080
Should something be happening?

28:03.948 --> 28:04.982
He said it, not me.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.117
Patience, please.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.019
Patience.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.193
(rumbling)

28:23.501 --> 28:25.469
Worth the wait?

28:25.471 --> 28:26.937
Washington's secret grave.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.316
Where is she?

28:39.318 --> 28:41.318
You could have given us
some warning, tom.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.886
You owe him that much.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.490
Frank, they're taking samples.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.224
Macey.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.559
Dad.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.830
What the hell is going on?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.898
Calm down, frank.
We needed to take some dna.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.866
You have no right.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.535
Forensics found dna
on father boland's neck.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.337
We need
to screen everyone

29:00.339 --> 29:02.039
Who was at
the murder site.

29:02.041 --> 29:07.244
Is there anything new
you two would like to tell us?

29:11.516 --> 29:13.417
Frank.

29:21.025 --> 29:24.027
You think my 13-year-old
handicapped daughter

29:24.029 --> 29:25.395
Is a suspect?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.030
It's a better lead than "evil."

29:27.032 --> 29:30.200
Look, it's clear you're under
a lot of pressure.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.869
Why don't you and your wife

29:31.871 --> 29:33.070
Take your daughter home
for the night.

29:33.072 --> 29:37.040
But, frank, if forensics
gets more...

29:37.042 --> 29:39.510
We'll come back with a warrant
for her arrest.

29:42.046 --> 29:45.382
(quietly): If you come
near my family without one,

29:45.384 --> 29:48.318
We will have a problem.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.292
♪

30:28.593 --> 30:29.927
"I.M."

30:29.929 --> 30:32.763
The indispensable man.

30:32.765 --> 30:35.999
A well-known moniker
for general washington.

30:38.937 --> 30:40.304
Looks simple enough.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.306
Let's get the map
and get out of here

30:42.308 --> 30:44.308
Before more of moloch's minions
show up.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.409
No, don't!

30:46.444 --> 30:48.979
Forgive me.

30:48.981 --> 30:52.115
I'd wager this pyramid
is triggered to ignite

30:52.117 --> 30:54.418
Upon the sign of
any tampering.

30:57.455 --> 30:59.122
Also, washington isn't

30:59.124 --> 31:01.191
In this pyramid--
too obvious.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.860
Where is he then?

31:06.197 --> 31:08.031
"cincinnatus."

31:09.868 --> 31:11.301
He was a roman general,

31:11.303 --> 31:12.970
Exiled to a life

31:12.972 --> 31:14.471
In the farmlands.

31:14.473 --> 31:17.975
When rome was under threat,
the senate retrieved him,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.977
Made him a dictator.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.478
When the crisis was over,

31:21.480 --> 31:23.146
He gave up his power

31:23.148 --> 31:24.581
And went back to the farm.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.718
I took latin in high school.

31:27.720 --> 31:31.989
Cincinnatus was
washington's hero.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.023
He represented

31:33.025 --> 31:35.559
The idea that power
should only be given

31:35.561 --> 31:37.961
To those who want it least.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.539
(click)

31:49.541 --> 31:52.075
(rumbling)

32:05.690 --> 32:07.090
Eureka.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.316
Oh, my.

32:35.753 --> 32:36.920
Abbie:
Nice teeth.

32:36.922 --> 32:40.290
Gold, ivory and lead.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.392
They were the envy of
every man in virginia.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.461
Not sure how martha
felt about them.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.903
Do you want me to do it?

32:52.905 --> 32:54.438
No, no, no, I'll...

32:54.440 --> 32:55.806
I'll do it.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.009
Forgive me, old friend.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.193
It's perfect.

33:21.599 --> 33:25.836
I have waited
a very long time for this.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.273
Katrina.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.642
Now I can free her.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.511
(creaking)

33:34.513 --> 33:36.446
Mr. Crane.
Miss mills.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.548
(crashing)

33:48.960 --> 33:51.194
Oh, my god.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.801
Brooks...

33:57.803 --> 33:59.436
What happened to you?

34:02.473 --> 34:04.408
(crackling)

34:10.148 --> 34:12.215
(groans)

34:19.323 --> 34:20.891
Andy.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.993
I don't know
what moloch did to you...

34:22.995 --> 34:26.129
But I know the andy that I know
is in there somewhere.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.066
The man that protected me.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.000
(deep voice):
Give me the map.

34:30.002 --> 34:32.035
The man that loves me,

34:32.037 --> 34:33.670
Andy...
The map!

34:33.672 --> 34:34.805
(yells)

34:37.075 --> 34:38.909
(screams)
(coughs)

34:44.015 --> 34:46.083
(gasping)

34:49.887 --> 34:52.422
(normal voice):
Abbie... Destroy the map.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.760
Moloch needs it in
order to win the war.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.106
Release me.

35:09.108 --> 35:13.076
Please, if you've ever...
Once felt anything...

35:13.078 --> 35:14.377
(screams)

35:14.379 --> 35:16.446
Miss mills! Quickly!

35:16.448 --> 35:19.349
(brooks screaming)

35:32.463 --> 35:34.064
Are you okay?

35:34.066 --> 35:35.232
I believe I am.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.933
That man...

35:36.935 --> 35:39.436
(rumbling)

35:39.438 --> 35:41.738
We need to get out of here.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.874
We're sealed inside.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.043
There must be another exit.

35:50.414 --> 35:52.582
Uh...

35:52.584 --> 35:54.684
The inner chamber.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.823
This way.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.992
There must be a way out
deeper in the crypt.

36:19.510 --> 36:23.513
Here we go-- the masonic
symbol of ascension.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.294
(clank)

36:37.296 --> 36:38.528
(rumbling)

36:38.530 --> 36:40.197
God bless the freemasons.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.304
Crane, how positive are you

36:47.306 --> 36:49.839
About this pyramid
being booby-trapped?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.808
70%. Well, 60.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.310
Well, no, 65.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.412
Lieutenant,
shoot the lever.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.051
(rumbling)

37:06.524 --> 37:07.490
(grunts)

37:07.492 --> 37:08.825
Go! Go!

37:08.827 --> 37:10.594
(grunts)

37:13.564 --> 37:14.464
(shouts)

37:23.040 --> 37:24.207
(panting)

37:24.209 --> 37:26.042
Henry!

37:26.044 --> 37:27.310
I'm fine.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.352
Crane...
You need to know...

37:35.354 --> 37:39.222
Before he died, brooks begged
me to destroy that map.

37:39.224 --> 37:42.125
He said moloch would
use it to win the war.

37:44.228 --> 37:45.762
Forget the prophecy.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.265
It's your call.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.610
I keep asking myself the same
question, over and over again.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.713
What would I do

38:03.715 --> 38:06.116
If this had nothing
to do with freeing katrina?

38:08.586 --> 38:10.520
What's the answer?

38:16.894 --> 38:18.962
Forgive me, my love.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.032
Mr. Crane!

38:23.267 --> 38:25.568
If using this map

38:25.570 --> 38:27.304
Meant betraying your trust...

38:28.939 --> 38:31.174
...That's something I cannot do.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.844
For the world.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.647
For our friendship.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.620
You and I will choose
our own destiny.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.488
We have free will.

38:46.924 --> 38:49.192
I choose
to forge my fate with you.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.265
I promise you...

38:55.267 --> 38:58.034
We <i>are</i> going to save her.

39:00.104 --> 39:02.005
I shall hold you
to that, lieutenant.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.956
Irving:
<i>I told them to stock the place</i>
<i>with your favorite ice cream.</i>

39:19.958 --> 39:20.957
Which is?

39:20.959 --> 39:22.325

I need to see you

44:42.681 --> 44:43.946
Please.

44:43.948 --> 44:45.948
And risk it be worn "ironically"

44:47.786 --> 44:49.652
Who discovered it

44:49.654 --> 44:51.621
I thank you, no.

44:51.623 --> 44:54.290
For judge a man not by the wear
of what he wears,

44:54.292 --> 44:58.194
But by the where
and how he wears it.

They scheduled irving's

44:59.964 --> 45:02.165

I'd get down there.

45:02.167 --> 45:04.200
Parish will be here momentarily.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.669
He emphasized the urgency.

45:06.671 --> 45:08.004
Irving just signed a confession

45:08.006 --> 45:11.874
To the murders of devon jones
and father boland.

45:11.876 --> 45:13.643
I think that falls under
the urgency category,

45:13.645 --> 45:15.311
Too.
He confessed

45:15.313 --> 45:16.379
To protect macey.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.181
Crane:
Yet they are both innocent.

45:18.183 --> 45:20.183
Surely our criminal
justice system

45:20.185 --> 45:21.317
Can account for that.

45:21.319 --> 45:22.985
You're talking to the girl
who spent a decade

45:22.987 --> 45:24.887

because she told the truth.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.055

45:26.057 --> 45:28.024
Afraid there's no time
for pleasantries, my friends.

45:28.026 --> 45:30.059
I believe that on this day,

45:30.061 --> 45:33.262
Moloch will seek
to unleash hell on earth.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.199
That's one way to enter a room.

45:36.201 --> 45:37.667
This morning I awoke

45:37.669 --> 45:39.235
From a terrible dream.

45:39.237 --> 45:40.570
It was a premonition.

45:40.572 --> 45:42.405
I have them on occasions.
In my vision,

45:42.407 --> 45:44.173
I saw moloch

45:44.175 --> 45:47.043
Surrounded by four white trees,

45:47.045 --> 45:50.179
And he was raising something
from the earth.

45:50.181 --> 45:51.748
<i>A creature of some kind.</i>

45:51.750 --> 45:53.883
What did the creature look like?
I couldn't see its face.

45:53.885 --> 45:55.084
Only a taloned hand

45:55.086 --> 45:56.686
<i>Covered in dirt.</i>

45:56.688 --> 45:57.887
And then I saw fragments.

45:57.889 --> 46:00.523
Images like pieces of a puzzle.

46:00.525 --> 46:03.059
A man on a flaming horse,

46:03.061 --> 46:05.762
Riding against a solar eclipse,

46:05.764 --> 46:07.230
A-and a voice said...

46:07.232 --> 46:08.364
"come and see."

46:08.366 --> 46:09.732
Abbie:
"and then another
horse came forth,

46:09.734 --> 46:11.701
"of fiery red.

46:11.703 --> 46:15.204
Its rider was given the power
to take peace from the earth."

that this is just a bad dream?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.066

46:44.068 --> 46:46.903
The celestial calendar confirms

46:46.905 --> 46:48.971
There will be a solar eclipse

48:06.818 --> 48:08.184
According to hidden messages

48:08.186 --> 48:10.152
Encoded
within washington's bible,

48:10.154 --> 48:12.388
A binding spell cast
upon the soil

48:12.390 --> 48:14.490
From which the second horseman
will emerge

48:14.492 --> 48:15.858
May prevent him

Witchcraft.

Unfortunately, all the witches

48:42.020 --> 48:43.686
To redraw the map.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.389
You lied.
A half-truth.

48:46.391 --> 48:49.525
A half-truth is a whole lie.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.227
All right, I lied.

48:51.229 --> 48:52.395
Yet I had no intention

48:52.397 --> 48:55.031
Of using this map
without your consent,

48:55.033 --> 48:58.134
But katrina is the only one who
can stop the second horseman.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.203
Show me.

49:01.205 --> 49:04.340
Admit it,
you appreciate me a little.

49:05.275 --> 49:06.742
Microscopically.

49:06.744 --> 49:09.211
Observe.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.080
The map is a cross section
of ley lines.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.382
Naturally forming pathways

49:13.384 --> 49:15.451
Said to be of historical

49:15.453 --> 49:18.220
And sometimes
spiritual significance.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.723
Let me guess: There's a ley line
right here in sleepy hollow.

49:20.725 --> 49:22.558
They converge
on what appears to be

49:22.560 --> 49:25.761
A dirt road that cuts
through forestland.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.129
Now, recall,

49:27.131 --> 49:28.631
If you will,
the words of general washington.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.232
Jenny:
Which one?

49:30.234 --> 49:32.134
Zombie washington or father
of the free world washington?

49:32.136 --> 49:34.937
The general said the battle
between good and evil

49:34.939 --> 49:37.073
<i>"would be won or lost</i>
<i>on a township</i>

49:37.075 --> 49:39.075
<i>"that took its name</i>
<i>from the hallowed ground</i>

49:39.077 --> 49:41.243
<i>"on which it lay,</i>

49:41.245 --> 49:43.479
<i>A doorway between worlds."</i>

49:45.115 --> 49:46.749
He was referring to this.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.250
This spot here,

49:48.252 --> 49:50.619
The gateway to purgatory.

49:50.621 --> 49:52.421
And my way back to katrina.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.156
What about the rest
of moloch's riddle?

49:54.158 --> 49:55.791
The saint's name?

49:55.793 --> 49:57.660
Irving may have
gotten us a lead with that.

49:57.662 --> 50:00.963
Since all of this began
with corbin and reverend knapp,

50:00.965 --> 50:03.632
He pulled knapp's things
from the impound and found

50:03.634 --> 50:04.834
This old datebook

50:04.836 --> 50:07.003
Logging meeting
between the two of them.

50:07.005 --> 50:09.438
Father.

50:09.440 --> 50:12.641
Sheriff.

50:12.643 --> 50:14.610
They were working together?
Corbin never told me.

50:14.612 --> 50:16.512
Corbin doesn't mention his name
in any of the hard files,

50:16.514 --> 50:17.947
But he's got the audio logs.

50:17.949 --> 50:19.448
I'm gonna need you
to start digging.

50:19.450 --> 50:20.783
There are hundreds
of hours of tapes.

50:20.785 --> 50:22.685
I'll never get through
all of them in time.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.487
It's the only lead that we have;
whatever they were on to,

50:24.489 --> 50:25.855
It's in there somewhere.

50:25.857 --> 50:28.924
(quietly):
Can I talk to you for a second?

50:36.800 --> 50:39.001
You're really gonna do this?

50:39.003 --> 50:40.369
Just walk into purgatory

50:40.371 --> 50:42.805
So crane can get
his wife back?

50:42.807 --> 50:44.206
Did I miss a backup plan?
Maybe you forgot

50:44.208 --> 50:46.375
Moloch guards purgatory.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.144
Oh, really? Was that his name?
Moloch,

50:48.146 --> 50:49.545
Who ripped our live in half,
I forgot all about it.

50:49.547 --> 50:50.813
Thanks for reminding me.
Who said crane would hand over

50:50.815 --> 50:52.481
Your soul, and you're
gonna make it easy for him.

50:52.483 --> 50:54.683
I want to stop running
from this bastard, jenny.

50:54.685 --> 50:56.685
Don't you? Aren't you tired
of being afraid?

50:56.687 --> 50:58.487
I don't want to be
a victim anymore.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.022
I want to face him.

51:00.024 --> 51:01.791
For me.

51:06.029 --> 51:08.230
It's for us.

51:11.535 --> 51:13.169
Do you remember the dollhouse

51:13.171 --> 51:16.172
We found in the dumpster
behind our house

51:16.174 --> 51:17.373
When we were little?

51:17.375 --> 51:20.342
Dollhouse.
(chuckles)

51:20.344 --> 51:23.879
Dad would be drunk,
mom talking to the silverware.

51:23.881 --> 51:25.848
We'd go upstairs,

51:25.850 --> 51:27.249
Lock the door and play with it,

51:27.251 --> 51:30.052
And you said

51:30.054 --> 51:32.188
"we're okay.

51:32.190 --> 51:33.722
"just pretend.

51:33.724 --> 51:35.758
"pretend this is our house.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.127
This is where
we'll always be safe."

51:39.529 --> 51:41.997
I believed you.

51:44.367 --> 51:47.136
And then you went away.

51:48.538 --> 51:50.539
Jenny...

51:50.541 --> 51:52.608
I don't want to lose you again.

51:54.878 --> 51:56.779
I can't.

51:58.715 --> 52:01.150
Listen to me.

52:02.719 --> 52:04.587
It's taken me a while
to come to terms

52:04.589 --> 52:06.155
With what happened to us.

52:07.557 --> 52:09.225
To me,

52:09.227 --> 52:10.960
What it really means.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.229
That you're a witness.

52:13.231 --> 52:15.131
With a capital "w."

52:16.566 --> 52:18.968
I'm not gonna lose you again.

52:21.471 --> 52:23.572
I need you to have faith.

52:23.574 --> 52:26.308
I have more than faith.

52:26.310 --> 52:29.111
I'm a mental patient with a gun.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.146
(chuckles)

52:30.148 --> 52:31.747
If you're not back by sunset,

52:31.749 --> 52:34.150
I will come hunt you down.

52:37.254 --> 52:39.321
Come back to me.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.769
Parish:
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

52:53.771 --> 52:56.338
The air feels somehow
different here.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.108
Gps says we're close.

52:59.110 --> 53:00.476
Now's probably a good time

53:00.478 --> 53:03.646
To ask how we're gonna find
katrina once we get in there.

53:03.648 --> 53:06.649
Your ancestors' church:
Grace and joseph.

53:06.651 --> 53:08.184
<i>Katrina said she visits</i>
<i>the "echo"</i>

53:08.186 --> 53:10.786
<i>Of that church every day.</i>

53:10.788 --> 53:14.190
And I light a candle in memoriam
and I pray for his soul.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.192
Crane:
On the bright side,

53:16.194 --> 53:18.160
At least we'll get
to experience

53:18.162 --> 53:20.129
Life after death
within our lifetime.

53:20.131 --> 53:22.798
That is a pretty
dark bright side.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.133
You must not take
this lightly.

53:24.135 --> 53:25.701
Purgatory is a maze
of temptation.

53:25.703 --> 53:28.304
If you are offered food or
drink, you must not accept it.

53:28.306 --> 53:31.140
The reality you're presented
will seem entirely true.

53:31.142 --> 53:33.642
And every part of you
will want to embrace it,

53:33.644 --> 53:36.011
But if you do,

53:36.013 --> 53:38.814
You'll be trapped there
for eternity...

53:38.816 --> 53:41.450
Imprisoned in
purgatory forever.

53:44.654 --> 53:47.022
(gps beeping rapidly)

53:47.024 --> 53:48.958
This is where
the lines converge.

53:52.028 --> 53:54.830
Washington inscribed this
incantation here,

53:54.832 --> 53:57.833
Meant to summon a doorway
to purgatory.

53:57.835 --> 53:59.702
And when you've found katrina,

53:59.704 --> 54:03.572
Repeat the words
and the doorway will reopen,

54:03.574 --> 54:05.140
Returning you here.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.476
We gotta move.

54:09.179 --> 54:11.013
Henry...

54:11.015 --> 54:13.182
Are you okay?

54:13.184 --> 54:15.651
I've come to care deeply
about you both.

54:16.853 --> 54:18.454
You gave me a reason
to hope again.

54:19.723 --> 54:24.526
And now I implore you
to cling to that hope.

54:24.528 --> 54:27.396
Remember your link
with each other.

54:27.398 --> 54:30.599
Purgatory will try
to make you forget it,

54:30.601 --> 54:33.435
But hold onto each other
in your hearts,

54:33.437 --> 54:36.038
And nothing can separate you.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.973
You were chosen
for this moment.

54:41.544 --> 54:43.846
I look forward
to meeting your wife.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.783
And I, to introducing you.

54:54.257 --> 54:57.926
Both:
We, the penitent,
with humble heart

54:57.928 --> 55:01.230
Upon this threshold
do summon thee:

55:01.232 --> 55:04.466
In mirror'd form appear,

55:04.468 --> 55:07.803
A gateway
to the world between worlds.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.538
(low rumbling, cracking)

55:40.770 --> 55:43.238
(birds chirping outside)

55:57.153 --> 55:58.821
Crane?

55:58.823 --> 56:00.689
August:
Abbie, eh, you're awake.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.124
How you feeling, kid?

56:02.126 --> 56:04.093
Brooks:
Hey, abbie.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.198
How are you both here?

56:13.169 --> 56:14.303
You're dead.

56:14.305 --> 56:15.637
Dead?

56:15.639 --> 56:17.840
Shoot, why doesn't anybody
ever tell me these things?

56:17.842 --> 56:18.841
(chuckles)

56:18.843 --> 56:20.142
Where in the hell is crane?

56:20.144 --> 56:22.177
What are you
talking about?
Ichabod crane!

56:22.179 --> 56:24.480
Okay, honey, honey,
you need to take it easy.

56:24.482 --> 56:25.647
Mm!

56:25.649 --> 56:27.649
Look, you got hit in
the head pretty hard.

56:27.651 --> 56:30.018
You got a concussion.
Sit down. Take it easy.

56:30.020 --> 56:32.154
The doctor said the
dizziness, memory loss,

56:32.156 --> 56:34.223
Hallucinations, that's all
normal side effects
after you wake up.

56:34.225 --> 56:35.491
They furloughed you

56:35.493 --> 56:37.259
From training
so you could recover here.

56:38.862 --> 56:40.229
Furlough?

56:40.231 --> 56:41.864
From quantico.

56:41.866 --> 56:43.699
Fbi academy?

56:43.701 --> 56:46.001
You got knocked out
in a live fire exercise.

56:46.003 --> 56:48.737
You remember any of it?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.173
I was at the academy?

56:51.175 --> 56:53.709
Yeah. Top of your class.

56:53.711 --> 56:55.844
Shocker. (chuckles)

56:55.846 --> 56:57.546
You left us all in the dust.

56:57.548 --> 57:00.716
This guy kicks my ass every week
'cause he misses you so much.

57:00.718 --> 57:02.351
You just need
to take it easy.

57:02.353 --> 57:04.019
They said that your place
is secure.

57:04.021 --> 57:05.888
You're gonna graduate with
your pick of assignments.

57:05.890 --> 57:07.055
Right now,

57:07.057 --> 57:09.258
You just need
to rest, okay?

57:13.229 --> 57:15.197
Mm.

57:15.199 --> 57:19.067
Ah, there's my girl. Yeah.

57:19.069 --> 57:22.771
Mm... I miss you so much.

57:24.207 --> 57:25.941
(sighs)

57:34.117 --> 57:36.852
I'm supposed to remember
something.

57:42.892 --> 57:44.526
Lieutenant?

57:45.628 --> 57:47.996
(piano playing light melody
in distance)

57:50.400 --> 57:52.367
(people conversing in distance)

57:54.604 --> 57:56.638
(piano playing light melody)

58:14.324 --> 58:16.758
Father.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.293
Welcome, son.

58:18.295 --> 58:21.830
After years of service
to his majesty's army abroad,

58:21.832 --> 58:25.267
You've returned home
a hero to your country.

58:25.269 --> 58:28.270
Cornwallis himself said
the battle of yorktown

58:28.272 --> 58:32.107
Could not have been won
without your decisive command!

58:32.109 --> 58:34.009
The british lost.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.143
(all laugh)

58:35.145 --> 58:37.145
Still a little
light-headed, I see.

58:37.147 --> 58:38.146
No doubt.

58:38.148 --> 58:39.348
I don't understand.

58:39.350 --> 58:40.849
You've been granted

58:40.851 --> 58:44.186
A full professorship with all
its attendant perquisites.

58:44.188 --> 58:46.455
Because of you,
the crane name will live on

58:46.457 --> 58:49.625
In these hallowed halls,

58:49.627 --> 58:51.527
A chain of unbroken purpose.

58:56.132 --> 58:58.534
Have you nothing to say?

59:03.339 --> 59:05.841
When I turned against England...

59:05.843 --> 59:08.744
You swore you'd never
speak to me again.

59:10.146 --> 59:11.813
You disavowed me as your son.

59:11.815 --> 59:15.517
(chuckles)
ichabod, you... You rum-beggar.

59:15.519 --> 59:19.154
Even as a boy,
your imagination always skewed

59:19.156 --> 59:22.157
Toward the greek tragedies!

59:22.159 --> 59:24.660
You are...

59:24.662 --> 59:27.362
And always will be...

59:27.364 --> 59:29.731
A child after my own heart.

59:31.067 --> 59:33.268
Come to me.

59:34.003 --> 59:35.904
I love you, my boy.

59:40.510 --> 59:43.245
And now, libation!

59:48.251 --> 59:50.185
August.
Apple pie a la mode.

59:50.187 --> 59:53.589
You got about five minutes
before that hot, crispy crust...

59:53.591 --> 59:56.024
Comes together
with the ice cream

59:56.026 --> 59:57.593
And melts
into a warm, soupy mess.

59:57.595 --> 59:58.927
(chuckles)

59:58.929 --> 1:00:01.096
You know, the first time
I took you to that diner,

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:03.031
I knew you were destined
for something great,

1:00:03.033 --> 1:00:04.766
That you were gonna matter,

1:00:04.768 --> 1:00:06.768
And I was gonna play a part
somehow.

1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:09.271
I'm so damn proud of you.

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:13.041
Ah, but first, pie, right?

1:00:13.043 --> 1:00:15.210
Yeah!
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:00:15.212 --> 1:00:17.446
(all laugh)

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:20.048
Oh, damn, boss,
you missed your calling.

1:00:20.050 --> 1:00:22.918
Yeah.
Eat up, kid.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:24.620
(all chuckle)

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:27.789
Just like old times, huh?

1:00:29.759 --> 1:00:32.060
I never thought I'd say this,
not in a million years,

1:00:32.062 --> 1:00:35.797
But I just want to go back
to the way it was before.

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.133
I'm afraid neither of us can.

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:45.040
This isn't real.

1:00:48.277 --> 1:00:49.711
This isn't real.

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:57.619
Where you do you think
you're going, abbie?

1:00:57.621 --> 1:00:59.254
You're not corbin.

1:00:59.256 --> 1:01:01.456
Abbie, you sit back
down at this table

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:03.492
And eat the damn pie,
you hear me?!

1:01:05.428 --> 1:01:09.097
Abbie, it hurts! Please
don't let him take my soul!

1:01:09.099 --> 1:01:11.800
Don't leave me here, kid.
Please!

1:01:11.802 --> 1:01:13.568
(shrieks)

1:01:15.104 --> 1:01:17.439
I once offered
that when you have

1:01:17.441 --> 1:01:20.108
Your own child, remember...

1:01:20.110 --> 1:01:24.346
He'll follow your example
more than your advice.

1:01:24.348 --> 1:01:29.117
Which is why I'm so deeply proud
to say and to see...

1:01:29.119 --> 1:01:30.952
You've done both.

1:01:30.954 --> 1:01:32.120
Cheers.

1:01:32.122 --> 1:01:34.189
<i>I used to imagine I'd be</i>

1:01:34.191 --> 1:01:36.224
A professor in my own right.

1:01:38.995 --> 1:01:43.765
Yet upheld by his pride for me.

1:01:48.337 --> 1:01:49.905
This is a dream.

1:01:51.641 --> 1:01:53.642
This is a dream.

1:01:53.644 --> 1:01:55.143
It's true, then.

1:01:55.145 --> 1:01:58.146
You choose to forsake
all I've given you?

1:01:58.148 --> 1:02:01.483
To turn your back on your
heritage, on your future...

1:02:01.485 --> 1:02:02.851
On me?!

1:02:02.853 --> 1:02:04.152
This is not my future.

1:02:04.154 --> 1:02:06.021
You are not my father.

1:02:06.023 --> 1:02:11.226
Drink what I offer, or you will
be sent to coventry: Forgotten,

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:14.062
Disowned, a crane no longer!

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:17.532
I've felt the pain
of your shunning once before,

1:02:17.534 --> 1:02:19.835
And I loved
you nonetheless.

1:02:19.837 --> 1:02:23.505
Yet my answer remains...

1:02:23.507 --> 1:02:24.606
No.

1:02:36.686 --> 1:02:39.254
(screams)

1:02:52.869 --> 1:02:56.071
August (on tape):
Still no evidence found
for that fire on milford.

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:57.539
Probably nothing.

1:02:57.541 --> 1:03:00.575
March 21st, found a dead body

1:03:00.577 --> 1:03:03.912
With a strange tattoo
on the back of his head.

1:03:03.914 --> 1:03:06.248
It's definitely some kind
of symbol,

1:03:06.250 --> 1:03:08.383
But nothing I've
ever seen before.

1:03:08.385 --> 1:03:09.918
Found a old pamphlet

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:15.590
From an antiques dealer in town
named adams circa 1781.

1:03:15.592 --> 1:03:18.059
It talks about a sermon

1:03:18.061 --> 1:03:21.730
At a church named trinity
outside of town.

1:03:21.732 --> 1:03:23.131
Now, this church has been
abandoned

1:03:23.133 --> 1:03:26.234
For over a hundred years.

1:03:26.236 --> 1:03:29.771
When I called reverend knapp to
find out what he knew about it,

1:03:29.773 --> 1:03:33.074
He insisted
that we meet in person.

1:03:33.076 --> 1:03:35.410
I think the answer
might be somewhere

1:03:35.412 --> 1:03:37.479
In the ruins of this old church.

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:40.982
(discordant chords playing
on piano)

1:03:50.593 --> 1:03:52.661
(discordant chords continue)

1:04:03.973 --> 1:04:06.041
(deep voice murmuring)

1:04:08.144 --> 1:04:10.212
(discordant chords continue)

1:04:12.148 --> 1:04:14.149
(sobbing)

1:04:14.151 --> 1:04:16.218
(whimpering)

1:04:19.021 --> 1:04:21.189
Excuse me.

1:04:21.191 --> 1:04:22.190
Miss?

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:25.193
(screams)

1:04:25.195 --> 1:04:27.529
(sobbing)

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:50.919
(gasps)

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:56.925
Crane.

1:04:57.894 --> 1:04:59.694
This isn't real.

1:04:59.696 --> 1:05:01.396
Our surroundings
may be an illusion,

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:03.832
Yet I assure you
I am the genuine article.

1:05:03.834 --> 1:05:05.000
Yet what

1:05:05.002 --> 1:05:07.035
Assurance do I have
that you are as well?

1:05:07.037 --> 1:05:09.738
After we trapped the horseman,

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.072
What did I teach you?

1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:20.749
It served a purpose
after all.

1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:26.187
I guess we survived
our first test.

1:05:26.189 --> 1:05:27.522
Temptation.
Huh.

1:05:27.524 --> 1:05:29.424
When I remembered you,

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:31.893
I saw this world
for what it truly is.

1:05:31.895 --> 1:05:33.328
Same.

1:05:34.697 --> 1:05:37.198
Parish said our link
to each other was the key.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.301
And now we must find katrina.

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:47.876
I recognize
these woods.

1:05:47.878 --> 1:05:50.045
It's where I first
found katrina.

1:05:50.047 --> 1:05:52.280
(moaning)

1:05:59.555 --> 1:06:01.623
(distant screaming)

1:06:06.095 --> 1:06:08.463
What the hell?

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.632
A form of hell,
it would seem.

1:06:10.634 --> 1:06:13.568
Lost souls...

1:06:13.570 --> 1:06:15.303
Searching for salvation.

1:06:28.084 --> 1:06:30.118
Katrina:
Ichabod! No, no, no!

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.920
I begged you
never to return here.

1:06:31.922 --> 1:06:34.322
What do you know of the secrets
of washington's bible?

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:37.625
Only that he wanted to ensure
that it found its way with you.

1:06:37.627 --> 1:06:39.995
Among its revelations,
it holds a map,

1:06:39.997 --> 1:06:41.429
Allowing us
to summon a doorway

1:06:41.431 --> 1:06:43.131
To and from
this place.

1:06:43.133 --> 1:06:45.467
Now, the second horseman

1:06:45.469 --> 1:06:47.802
Will ride into the mortal realm
this very day...

1:06:47.804 --> 1:06:49.104
And you can stop him.

1:06:49.106 --> 1:06:52.107
You'll finally be free
from this place.

1:06:52.109 --> 1:06:53.641
We're gonna bring you home.

1:06:53.643 --> 1:06:56.144
Oh, no, I can't.

1:06:56.146 --> 1:06:57.445
Abbie:
Sure you can.

1:06:57.447 --> 1:06:58.813
We'll help you pack.

1:06:58.815 --> 1:07:00.115
No soul can

1:07:00.117 --> 1:07:02.117
Leave this place without
being granted forgiveness.

1:07:02.119 --> 1:07:04.119
To leave
without it...

1:07:04.121 --> 1:07:06.121
It would break down the walls
between the worlds.

1:07:06.123 --> 1:07:08.123
Abbie:
I can't accept that.

1:07:08.125 --> 1:07:10.358
We didn't come this far
to get dinged by some

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.693
Metaphysical technicality.

1:07:11.695 --> 1:07:14.129
We're not leaving without you.

1:07:14.131 --> 1:07:15.296
With war's
arrival,

1:07:15.298 --> 1:07:17.365
Our destruction
is assured either way.

1:07:19.635 --> 1:07:21.536
What are you
not saying?

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.174
There's no time for
indecision, my love.

1:07:26.176 --> 1:07:29.010
There is...
An alternative.

1:07:29.012 --> 1:07:32.047
One that requires
a sacrifice of great cost,

1:07:32.049 --> 1:07:34.149
One I cannot ask.

1:07:34.151 --> 1:07:34.916
Spill it.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:43.858
My soul can
leave this realm...

1:07:43.860 --> 1:07:46.261
But only if another
were to take my place.

1:07:55.871 --> 1:07:57.238
Katrina:
Please, I beg you both,

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:58.573
Leave before none of us can.

1:07:58.575 --> 1:08:00.008
Crane:
If one of us is to remain here

1:08:00.010 --> 1:08:02.677
In order to
set you free...

1:08:02.679 --> 1:08:03.878
It shall be me.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:05.346
No...

1:08:05.348 --> 1:08:07.015
It's me.

1:08:07.017 --> 1:08:08.883
That is not
an option.

1:08:08.885 --> 1:08:10.185
I have to face him, crane.

1:08:10.187 --> 1:08:11.219
Moloch.

1:08:11.221 --> 1:08:13.188
I can't keep running away.

1:08:13.190 --> 1:08:14.355
I won't.

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:16.558
Lieutenant...

1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:18.426
I'm not asking
for your permission.

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:20.562
You did not
ask me for mine

1:08:20.564 --> 1:08:21.563
When you decided
to end your life

1:08:21.565 --> 1:08:22.597
Before you knew
that parish

1:08:22.599 --> 1:08:24.099
Could separate you
from the horseman.

1:08:24.101 --> 1:08:26.434
And then you very wisely
convinced me

1:08:26.436 --> 1:08:28.236
There is always another way.

1:08:28.238 --> 1:08:29.904
This is the only way!

1:08:29.906 --> 1:08:32.407
We need katrina
to stop war.

1:08:32.409 --> 1:08:36.211
We were chosen for this.

1:08:36.213 --> 1:08:39.047
To sacrifice ourselves
so that humanity can endure,

1:08:39.049 --> 1:08:40.648
So that people can choose
their destiny.

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.621
It's my turn, ichabod.

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:51.559
Moloch warned that I would
deliver you to him,

1:08:51.561 --> 1:08:52.760
And here we are.

1:08:52.762 --> 1:08:55.930
If we do this, his prophecy
will be fulfilled.

1:08:55.932 --> 1:08:57.298
(distant snarling)

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.768
We are out of time.

1:09:00.770 --> 1:09:02.070
This amulet
was bound by

1:09:02.072 --> 1:09:03.805
The sisterhood of
the radiant heart.

1:09:03.807 --> 1:09:06.241
It will protect you from moloch.

1:09:06.243 --> 1:09:07.942
I will not allow you
to remain here for long.

1:09:07.944 --> 1:09:10.311
Once we've stopped
war's arrival,

1:09:10.313 --> 1:09:12.213
I will return
to set you free.

1:09:13.282 --> 1:09:14.983
I'm counting on it.

1:09:14.985 --> 1:09:17.085
I swear to you,

1:09:17.087 --> 1:09:19.254
For as long as
I can draw breath...

1:09:19.256 --> 1:09:21.322
Our work
is not done.

1:09:22.124 --> 1:09:24.259
You will come
back for me.

1:09:24.261 --> 1:09:25.994
That, I know.

1:09:29.632 --> 1:09:31.699
Remember our bond.

1:09:33.269 --> 1:09:35.603
I'll come back
for you.

1:09:35.605 --> 1:09:37.772
(masonry splintering, falling)

1:09:37.774 --> 1:09:40.608
(snarling)
have faith.

1:09:40.610 --> 1:09:42.343
(crashing)

1:09:43.345 --> 1:09:45.647
Go!

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:46.981
Go!

1:09:46.983 --> 1:09:48.449
Repeat these words after me.

1:09:48.451 --> 1:09:50.118
We, the penitent,
with humble heart...

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.487
We, the penitent,
with humble heart...

1:09:52.489 --> 1:09:54.622
...Upon this threshold
do summon thee:

1:09:54.624 --> 1:09:56.291
...Upon this
threshold do summon thee:

1:09:56.293 --> 1:09:58.026
In mirror'd
form appear...

1:09:58.028 --> 1:09:59.160
In mirror'd
form appear...

1:09:59.162 --> 1:10:01.162
...A gateway

1:10:01.164 --> 1:10:03.131
To the world
between worlds.

1:10:03.133 --> 1:10:04.866
...A gateway to
the world between worlds.

1:10:23.519 --> 1:10:25.587
Parish:
Ichabod.

1:10:32.494 --> 1:10:34.162
Where is abigail?

1:10:34.164 --> 1:10:38.399
Katrina could not be freed...

1:10:38.401 --> 1:10:40.668
Unless another soul
assumed her place.

1:10:40.670 --> 1:10:43.071
Moloch's prophecy.

1:10:43.073 --> 1:10:44.906
I will be back for her.

1:10:47.876 --> 1:10:49.744
(voices whispering)

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:57.185
(shrieking)

1:10:57.187 --> 1:10:58.586
You son of a bitch.

1:10:59.521 --> 1:11:00.955
It's just you and me now.

1:11:06.695 --> 1:11:08.196
Now...

1:11:08.198 --> 1:11:10.265
You are mine.

1:11:10.267 --> 1:11:13.201
I was never yours...

1:11:13.203 --> 1:11:14.369
And I never will be.

1:11:14.371 --> 1:11:16.271
(roaring)

1:11:16.273 --> 1:11:18.273
(sizzling)

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:27.749
Katrina:
Ichabod.

1:11:27.751 --> 1:11:30.151
(breathing hard)

1:11:36.258 --> 1:11:37.759
Ichabod!

1:11:37.761 --> 1:11:38.960
Is this real?

1:11:39.595 --> 1:11:41.095
Am I truly here?

1:11:41.097 --> 1:11:42.463
Yes, my love.

1:11:42.465 --> 1:11:44.599
(sobs)

1:11:44.601 --> 1:11:46.134
Excuse me.

1:11:47.903 --> 1:11:50.104
My name is henry parish.

1:11:50.106 --> 1:11:52.307
It's...

1:11:52.309 --> 1:11:55.143
A pleasure to make your
acquaintance, mrs. Crane.

1:11:55.145 --> 1:11:57.312
You're the
sin eater.

1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:00.315
We must hurry.

1:12:00.317 --> 1:12:02.317
The eclipse is near.

1:12:02.319 --> 1:12:04.118
You said you foresaw
moloch pull a creature

1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:06.321
From the ground
in these woods.

1:12:06.323 --> 1:12:08.623
Can you find
the location?

1:12:08.625 --> 1:12:10.591
A pathfinding
spell

1:12:10.593 --> 1:12:12.994
Should guide us to
our destination.

1:12:22.471 --> 1:12:24.005
My power's weakened.

1:12:24.007 --> 1:12:25.940
It's been centuries

1:12:25.942 --> 1:12:27.608
Since I
used it here.

1:12:27.610 --> 1:12:29.177
Ah...

1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:33.147
Northeast.

1:12:33.149 --> 1:12:34.615
That is where
we must go.

1:12:34.617 --> 1:12:36.617
I married a witch.

1:12:36.619 --> 1:12:37.952
(laughs)

1:12:37.954 --> 1:12:40.188
How... Cool.

1:12:41.457 --> 1:12:43.691
It is a figure of speech,
you'll learn.

1:12:43.693 --> 1:12:44.926
Come.

1:12:58.807 --> 1:13:02.143
Okay, old man, I'm here.

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:05.046
What do you want me to find?

1:13:11.186 --> 1:13:12.887
Katrina:
We're here.

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:15.089
I sense the presence
of a great evil.

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:21.295
She's right.
Look.

1:13:22.664 --> 1:13:24.665
Just as they were
in my vision.

1:13:24.667 --> 1:13:26.901
And in mine.

1:13:30.072 --> 1:13:32.874
This is where the second
horseman will emerge.

1:13:32.876 --> 1:13:34.409
Corbin:
My dig into the church's

1:13:34.411 --> 1:13:37.345
History indicates it changed
owners over the course

1:13:37.347 --> 1:13:39.347
Of two centuries
and was renamed several times

1:13:39.349 --> 1:13:40.948
Before it was
eventually abandoned.

1:13:43.218 --> 1:13:45.186
But its last recorded title
seems to have disappeared

1:13:45.188 --> 1:13:47.688
From the county files
altogether.

1:13:47.690 --> 1:13:49.190
Great.

1:13:49.192 --> 1:13:51.259
Waste of time.

1:13:51.261 --> 1:13:52.693
I'm starting to believe
there's no such thing

1:13:52.695 --> 1:13:54.562
As a coincidence around here.

1:13:54.564 --> 1:13:57.832
Why would someone want to hide
an abandoned church's name?

1:14:00.102 --> 1:14:02.170
(clanking)

1:14:33.101 --> 1:14:35.803
♪

1:14:37.473 --> 1:14:38.473
Abbie:
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>lieutenant mills.</i>

1:14:38.475 --> 1:14:39.941
Please leave a message.

1:14:39.943 --> 1:14:41.242
(beeps)

1:14:41.244 --> 1:14:42.310
Abbie, it's me.

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:43.611
God, I hope you're okay.

1:14:43.613 --> 1:14:44.779
I figured out moloch's warning:

1:14:44.781 --> 1:14:46.647
"the saint's name is a sign."

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:47.915
He meant it literally.

1:14:47.917 --> 1:14:49.951
So whatever you do, you can't...

1:14:49.953 --> 1:14:51.085
(screams)

1:14:51.087 --> 1:14:52.320
(tires screech)

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:07.235
(horse neighs)

1:15:21.617 --> 1:15:23.684
(grunts)

1:15:41.470 --> 1:15:43.704
Hey.

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:49.310
Come in.

1:15:49.312 --> 1:15:51.145
We're having
a tea party.

1:15:51.147 --> 1:15:53.648
Where am I?

1:15:53.650 --> 1:15:56.884
The place we've always
felt most safe.

1:15:58.153 --> 1:15:59.720
Moloch can't get to you in here.

1:16:00.989 --> 1:16:03.157
There's a reason

1:16:03.159 --> 1:16:06.527
You can't remember what happened
to you that day in the woods.

1:16:06.529 --> 1:16:08.396
After we saw him rise
up from behind the trees.

1:16:11.166 --> 1:16:13.668
We blacked out.
No.

1:16:13.670 --> 1:16:16.070
We saw more.

1:16:16.072 --> 1:16:17.738
Much more.

1:16:17.740 --> 1:16:19.507
I don't understand.

1:16:19.509 --> 1:16:22.677
The reason you can't remember
what happened next

1:16:22.679 --> 1:16:24.278
Is because we're your memory.

1:16:26.014 --> 1:16:27.748
Moloch took us
out of your head.

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:29.083
You and jenny both.

1:16:29.085 --> 1:16:31.752
What do you mean
he took you out of my head?

1:16:31.754 --> 1:16:34.088
To make you forget the truth.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:36.958
That's why we've been locked
away here since that day.

1:16:38.527 --> 1:16:40.595
So you wouldn't find us.

1:16:44.099 --> 1:16:46.067
The eclipse is nearly complete.

1:16:46.069 --> 1:16:47.535
Soon the second horseman
will rise.

1:16:47.537 --> 1:16:49.203
Something's wrong.

1:16:49.205 --> 1:16:50.538
The binding spell isn't working.

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:52.039
What do you mean?

1:16:52.041 --> 1:16:54.942
This ground,
I feel nothing beneath it.

1:16:54.944 --> 1:16:56.210
If the second horseman

1:16:56.212 --> 1:16:58.579
Was supposed to be here...
It's gone.

1:16:58.581 --> 1:17:00.715
It's here.

1:17:00.717 --> 1:17:02.950
I assure you.

1:17:02.952 --> 1:17:06.053
Do you know
the etymology of the word

1:17:06.055 --> 1:17:08.222
"apocalypse"?

1:17:08.224 --> 1:17:09.390
To disclose or reveal.

1:17:09.392 --> 1:17:12.393
That time...

1:17:12.395 --> 1:17:14.028
Has come.

1:17:15.063 --> 1:17:16.297
Henry?

1:17:21.236 --> 1:17:23.304
(grunting)

1:17:24.239 --> 1:17:27.241
(gasping)

1:17:27.243 --> 1:17:29.110
Stop! Leave her be, damn you!

1:17:29.112 --> 1:17:31.145
You're in no position
to make demands.

1:17:32.481 --> 1:17:34.181
I suggest you stop struggling.

1:17:38.587 --> 1:17:39.854
Your power is nothing
compared to mine.

1:17:40.989 --> 1:17:42.590
I trusted you!

1:17:42.592 --> 1:17:44.925
You needed faith,
my dear ichabod,

1:17:44.927 --> 1:17:47.294
And I gave it to you,
both of you--

1:17:47.296 --> 1:17:49.263
In your desire

1:17:49.265 --> 1:17:51.165
To be reunited.

1:17:52.267 --> 1:17:54.101
And to abigail,
who so desperately

1:17:54.103 --> 1:17:56.003
Needs to believe
there's a purpose

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:58.139
To her pain.

1:17:58.141 --> 1:18:01.142
See, faith is a pillar
of human nature.

1:18:01.144 --> 1:18:03.010
The belief that all will

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:05.012
End well if we just

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:08.616
Cling onto it
with all our might.

1:18:08.618 --> 1:18:11.452
And it is what blinds us

1:18:11.454 --> 1:18:13.654
To what's right
in front of us all along.

1:18:13.656 --> 1:18:15.990
It was you who appeared
to me in purgatory.

1:18:15.992 --> 1:18:17.458
Of course it was.

1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:20.494
I planted the simple seed

1:18:20.496 --> 1:18:21.962
In your fertile mind.

1:18:21.964 --> 1:18:23.998
The first glimmer of hope

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.200
In over two centuries.

1:18:27.369 --> 1:18:29.036
The sin eater.

1:18:30.005 --> 1:18:32.406
It was you
that brought us together.

1:18:33.475 --> 1:18:36.377
All I had to do
was play my part.

1:18:36.379 --> 1:18:39.380
For so long,
I've hoped for this day.

1:18:39.382 --> 1:18:42.216
To find the reason
for what I've been given.

1:18:42.218 --> 1:18:44.652
The reason is you.

1:18:44.654 --> 1:18:46.821
I gave you the answer
so many times.

1:18:46.823 --> 1:18:49.156
I practically spelled it
out for you.

1:18:49.158 --> 1:18:51.058
Parish:
A good puzzle misleads you.

1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:53.160
It sends you in one direction,

1:18:53.162 --> 1:18:56.030
Fools you into thinking
you know what's going on.

1:18:56.032 --> 1:18:59.200
But once you've discovered
the trick,

1:18:59.202 --> 1:19:02.336
You see that there's
often a hidden meaning.

1:19:02.338 --> 1:19:03.838
Who are you?

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:05.339
(sighs)

1:19:05.341 --> 1:19:07.908
And still you see so little.

1:19:07.910 --> 1:19:10.177
Don't you know?

1:19:10.179 --> 1:19:11.912
Can't you guess?

1:19:11.914 --> 1:19:14.582
An emissary of moloch?

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:18.219
Oh, I'm much more than that.

1:19:18.221 --> 1:19:22.723
Your binding spell
had no effect...

1:19:22.725 --> 1:19:24.992
Because there was
nothing to bind.

1:19:26.595 --> 1:19:28.529
The second horseman
was unearthed

1:19:28.531 --> 1:19:30.397
Over a decade ago

1:19:30.399 --> 1:19:33.567
On this very day
under the darkening sun.

1:19:33.569 --> 1:19:36.103
And as moloch prophesied,

1:19:36.105 --> 1:19:39.774
He has waited
all this time to take form.

1:19:41.243 --> 1:19:44.712
We saw moloch appear
from behind the trees.

1:19:44.714 --> 1:19:48.415
It wasn't an accident that
he was in the forest that day.

1:19:48.417 --> 1:19:50.050
He came for a reason.

1:19:50.052 --> 1:19:52.386
Just like we were sent
there to stop him.

1:19:52.388 --> 1:19:55.356
What do you mean
we were "sent there"?

1:19:56.391 --> 1:19:58.058
Why was moloch in the woods?

1:19:58.060 --> 1:19:59.460
I need to know.

1:19:59.462 --> 1:20:02.129
What did I see?

1:20:25.787 --> 1:20:27.755
Katrina:
It's you.

1:20:27.757 --> 1:20:29.323
You are the
second horseman.

1:20:29.325 --> 1:20:31.425
Just like abraham
once was a mortal man

1:20:31.427 --> 1:20:32.927
Before he became death.

1:20:32.929 --> 1:20:34.428
Only half mortal.

1:20:34.430 --> 1:20:35.930
I am...

1:20:35.932 --> 1:20:37.464
After all...

1:20:37.466 --> 1:20:39.667
What you made me.

1:20:41.102 --> 1:20:42.670
Mother.

1:20:44.005 --> 1:20:45.239
And father.

1:20:46.942 --> 1:20:48.776
No.

1:20:48.778 --> 1:20:51.078
Jeremy?

1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:53.948
You died.

1:20:53.950 --> 1:20:57.184
Murdered by my mother's
own coven.

1:20:59.955 --> 1:21:01.488
Condemned...

1:21:01.490 --> 1:21:04.124
As an orphaned, wayward warlock,

1:21:04.126 --> 1:21:05.960
And left to whither

1:21:05.962 --> 1:21:08.863
In a plain, pine box.

1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:22.009
Yet my blood...

1:21:22.011 --> 1:21:24.511
Our blood...

1:21:24.513 --> 1:21:26.547
(ground rumbling)

1:21:26.549 --> 1:21:29.149
...Was strong enough to breath

1:21:29.151 --> 1:21:31.218
Life back into my lungs.

1:21:36.992 --> 1:21:38.492
Just as it gave

1:21:38.494 --> 1:21:42.296
My beloved golem
life when I was a child.

1:21:45.901 --> 1:21:48.836
Your son's blood is your blood.

1:21:48.838 --> 1:21:51.505
You knew my blood
would destroy it.

1:21:51.507 --> 1:21:53.173
(grunting)

1:21:53.175 --> 1:21:55.242
(bellowing screams)

1:21:57.012 --> 1:22:00.714
And yet you allowed me
to kill it.

1:22:00.716 --> 1:22:03.183
Sometimes those we love
must be sacrificed

1:22:03.185 --> 1:22:05.519
On the altar
of a higher purpose.

1:22:05.521 --> 1:22:08.055
You survived the death hex.

1:22:08.057 --> 1:22:11.692
Death would have been
a merciful gift

1:22:11.694 --> 1:22:14.762
Compared with what followed.

1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:17.865
For two centuries,

1:22:17.867 --> 1:22:21.035
I weakened

1:22:21.037 --> 1:22:24.371
In this dark prison.

1:22:24.373 --> 1:22:26.040
Feeding on the vines

1:22:26.042 --> 1:22:28.542
That crept in
along side of me.

1:22:28.544 --> 1:22:32.046
Crying out to the pitiless god
that put me there.

1:22:32.048 --> 1:22:34.081
And to the two

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:35.950
Who abandoned me

1:22:35.952 --> 1:22:38.285
To eternal suffering.

1:22:42.057 --> 1:22:45.626
Then after two centuries,

1:22:45.628 --> 1:22:47.795
I heard a voice.

1:22:50.565 --> 1:22:52.099
The voice of my true father

1:22:52.101 --> 1:22:54.301
Offering salvation.

1:22:57.605 --> 1:22:59.606
Jeremy...

1:22:59.608 --> 1:23:02.109
Moloch is not your father.

1:23:02.111 --> 1:23:04.745
He is a prince of lies.

1:23:04.747 --> 1:23:07.114
He came...

1:23:07.116 --> 1:23:10.484
<i>And took me out of the earth.</i>

1:23:10.486 --> 1:23:13.120
God sent a witness
to try and stop me,

1:23:13.122 --> 1:23:14.822
<i>But she was not</i>
<i>yet strong enough.</i>

1:23:14.824 --> 1:23:16.156
We defeated her then

1:23:16.158 --> 1:23:18.359
And we have defeated her now!

1:23:22.263 --> 1:23:25.265
I have to find
a way out of here.

1:23:25.267 --> 1:23:27.301
I need to help them.

1:23:27.303 --> 1:23:29.003
It's too late.

1:23:29.005 --> 1:23:31.305
The doorway's closed.

1:23:31.307 --> 1:23:33.474
I don't think
that you understand.

1:23:33.476 --> 1:23:36.143
I have to find a way home.

1:23:36.145 --> 1:23:37.678
This is your home now.

1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:40.347
This is your home.

1:23:49.858 --> 1:23:52.493
You invented
an entire family history.

1:23:52.495 --> 1:23:53.861
Even your name.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:55.129
No, no, no.

1:23:55.131 --> 1:23:56.663
Not my name.

1:23:56.665 --> 1:23:57.831
That was given

1:23:57.833 --> 1:23:59.533
To me by god's grace.

1:24:00.835 --> 1:24:02.202
<i>The very church</i>
<i>where you abandoned me</i>

1:24:02.204 --> 1:24:03.837
<i>As a child</i>

1:24:03.839 --> 1:24:05.539
<i>Was the first place</i>

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:08.042
<i>I saw upon my resurrection.</i>

1:24:13.148 --> 1:24:16.250
So I took the
saint's name to spite him.

1:24:21.156 --> 1:24:24.391
Crane:
<i>Jeremy, listen to me,</i>
<i>I beg you.</i>

1:24:24.393 --> 1:24:26.160
We are all children

1:24:26.162 --> 1:24:27.861
In the absence of our parents.

1:24:27.863 --> 1:24:29.830
Believe me,
I know this to be true.

1:24:29.832 --> 1:24:31.331
You know nothing!

1:24:31.333 --> 1:24:33.901
Every choice that I made,
I made it to protect you.

1:24:33.903 --> 1:24:36.003
I spent two centuries
under the earth

1:24:36.005 --> 1:24:37.538
For your choices!

1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.006
And she spent
two centuries

1:24:39.008 --> 1:24:42.009
In purgatory
suffering the consequences!

1:24:42.011 --> 1:24:43.677
(chuckles)

1:24:43.679 --> 1:24:46.013
Oh... Look.

1:24:46.015 --> 1:24:48.582
This is our first family spat.

1:24:52.220 --> 1:24:54.688
You cannot fathom

1:24:54.690 --> 1:24:58.192
How meaningless
your words are to me.

1:24:58.194 --> 1:25:01.228
Now that the two
witnesses are separated,

1:25:01.230 --> 1:25:03.697
There is nothing to stop us

1:25:03.699 --> 1:25:06.333
Breaking the second seal.

1:25:08.036 --> 1:25:11.705
And fulfilling
a promise made long ago

1:25:11.707 --> 1:25:13.107
To an old friend.

1:25:13.109 --> 1:25:15.175
(horse neighs)

1:25:28.957 --> 1:25:31.125
She's finally yours, abraham.

1:25:33.228 --> 1:25:34.628
No, no!

1:25:34.630 --> 1:25:36.630
Pleasant dreams.

1:25:37.398 --> 1:25:39.066
Don't! Katrina!

1:25:39.068 --> 1:25:40.934
(grunting)

1:25:40.936 --> 1:25:43.170
No! No!

1:25:44.606 --> 1:25:45.639
Katrina!

1:25:50.578 --> 1:25:51.712
(yells)

1:25:55.650 --> 1:25:57.651
(grunts)

1:26:04.792 --> 1:26:07.995
Now you'll know
what it's like to lose faith.

1:26:07.997 --> 1:26:10.597
When it's gone,
you have nothing.

1:26:10.599 --> 1:26:13.133
And when you have nothing,

1:26:13.135 --> 1:26:15.269
There's nothing holding you back

1:26:15.271 --> 1:26:17.337
From what you're capable of.

1:26:18.306 --> 1:26:20.841
Behold the second seal!

1:26:24.112 --> 1:26:25.812
Don't!

1:26:25.814 --> 1:26:27.347
(thunder crashes)

1:26:27.349 --> 1:26:30.851
War isn't coming
to sleepy hollow.

1:26:30.853 --> 1:26:34.688
It's been waiting all along.

1:26:34.690 --> 1:26:36.323
And now...

1:26:36.325 --> 1:26:39.459
It begins.

1:26:39.461 --> 1:26:40.694
Good-bye, father.

1:26:40.696 --> 1:26:48.001
No! No! No!

1:26:48.003 --> 1:26:50.237
