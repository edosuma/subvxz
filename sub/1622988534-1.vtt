00:49.180 --> 00:50.650
<i>Hey, Siriso's Bar,</i>

00:50.716 --> 00:52.885
<i>voted number-one sports bar
in all five boroughs.</i>

00:52.952 --> 00:55.453
<i>By who? By everyone.
That's who. Forget about it.</i>

00:55.520 --> 00:57.723
<i>Whether it's Mets, Jets,
or Nets, we play it all.</i>

00:57.790 --> 00:59.524
<i>Put a 25-cent wing
in your mouth</i>

00:59.591 --> 01:01.961
<i>and wash it down with
a handful of domestic draft.</i>

01:02.028 --> 01:03.261
<i>You kidding me right now?</i>

01:03.328 --> 01:04.764
<i>No, I'm not kidding
you right now.</i>

01:04.830 --> 01:06.464
<i>Located in Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn,</i>

01:06.531 --> 01:08.601
<i>right off of Bay Parkway...
you know the place.</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:10.970
<i>Siriso's, located next
to The Emporium Nightclub.</i>

01:32.658 --> 01:34.292
What?

01:34.359 --> 01:36.294
What do you want me to say?

01:36.361 --> 01:38.396
Ain't nothing to say. Right?

01:38.463 --> 01:40.099
That's right.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.702
And that's the way
it's got to be, you understand?

01:42.768 --> 01:44.603
You don't say nothing
that don't concern you.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.372
That's how you keep
out of trouble.

01:47.439 --> 01:51.911
Gio and Sofia, what are
they supposed to do now?

01:51.977 --> 01:54.512
That's Angelo's thing.
He'll do right by them.

01:54.579 --> 01:57.817
He'll sort everything out.
Understand?

01:57.883 --> 01:59.584
It's just so fucked.

01:59.652 --> 02:03.089
I mean, Uncle Angelo
couldn't do nothing?

02:03.155 --> 02:04.255
I thought he was boss.

02:04.322 --> 02:05.725
Hey.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.027
You're skating on thin ice,
my little friend.

02:13.598 --> 02:16.501
Don't you got something
for me, anyway, huh?

02:16.568 --> 02:19.205
Where's my taste
from the chinks?

02:19.270 --> 02:22.174
Come on. Cough it up.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.844
Hey!

02:24.910 --> 02:27.079
- I got money on that game.
- Oh, seriously,

02:27.146 --> 02:28.848
I can't listen to them
getting beat no more.

02:28.914 --> 02:32.118
Touch my radio again,
I'll crack your head open.

02:36.454 --> 02:38.389
You know you're
my favorite nephew.

02:38.456 --> 02:39.992
Even though you got
terrible taste in music.

02:42.194 --> 02:45.164
Will you look at this shit?
On my grandmother's block.

02:47.733 --> 02:50.603
Yo, my man, those your bikes?

02:50.669 --> 02:54.006
- Yo, fuck off.
- Hey. Believe this kid?

02:54.073 --> 02:55.908
Whatever. Fuck him.
I got to go meet Gio anyway.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.810
- Let's just go.
- Hey, man, what do you suck

02:57.877 --> 02:59.245
your mother's
dick with that mouth?

02:59.310 --> 03:01.714
- The fuck you say?
- Huh? Stop.

03:04.349 --> 03:06.551
Don't do anything stupid.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.286
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, man.

03:08.353 --> 03:09.655
- Let me see some ID.
- For what?

03:09.722 --> 03:11.090
I didn't even do nothing, man.

03:11.157 --> 03:15.027
Show me your ID, then.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.862
Ricardo.

03:19.231 --> 03:21.499
Ricardo.

03:21.566 --> 03:23.501
Now you broke my glasses.

03:27.773 --> 03:29.541
Ricardo, just calm down.

03:29.608 --> 03:32.343
Just calm down.
Okay, okay. Fuck.

04:24.096 --> 04:25.931
Gio.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.532
Hey, Father Kelly.

04:27.599 --> 04:28.968
Gio, my boy.

04:29.034 --> 04:32.605
It's good to see you.
How's your mother?

04:32.671 --> 04:34.940
She gave me this
to give to you.

04:37.643 --> 04:41.113
People, you know, keep bringing
food by the house,

04:41.180 --> 04:44.884
and the fridge is full...
since the funeral.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.023
You want to tell me
what happened to your eye?

05:02.101 --> 05:04.703
I was sitting in
the cafeteria

05:04.770 --> 05:06.437
with Vicky,
eating lunch, like normal,

05:06.504 --> 05:07.840
and these... these Russian kids

05:07.907 --> 05:09.808
who were sitting
a few tables over

05:09.875 --> 05:11.310
starting throwing things at us.

05:11.377 --> 05:14.780
And it hit... hit Vicky in the
head with a chicken nugget.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.349
So I got up.
Like, what the... the heck?

05:17.415 --> 05:20.719
You know? That's it.
That's all I did.

05:22.988 --> 05:24.589
I woke up
in the nurse's office.

05:29.594 --> 05:32.164
I'm suspended.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.499
What did your mother say?

05:34.565 --> 05:37.535
I tried to talk to her.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.705
All she does is lay in bed.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.509
You have to be patient
with her, Gio.

05:44.575 --> 05:48.546
Your mother, she's going
through a lot right now.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.617
I tell you what...
I'll speak to her.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.621
I could use an extra hand
around here.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.223
Get you out of the house
while you're suspended.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.661
You remember the bannister
you painted with your father

06:02.728 --> 06:06.432
all those years ago?

06:06.497 --> 06:08.867
Well, time for a touch-up.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.142
There's gonna be
lots of changes now, Gio.

06:17.209 --> 06:19.678
Revelations that you may
not like or understand,

06:19.745 --> 06:24.283
but you will, in time.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.086
With tragedy comes strength.

06:27.152 --> 06:31.223
Trust that.
Put your faith in Our Lord.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.763
You stay strong for me,
I have Mets-Braves tickets...

06:37.830 --> 06:39.798
third base line
with your name on it.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.569
- Seriously?
- Would a priest lie?

06:46.939 --> 06:48.907
Go on. Get out of here.

07:00.085 --> 07:03.055
<i>A couple of weeks ago,
Gio's father was discovered</i>

07:03.122 --> 07:06.392
<i>strangled to death
in the trunk of his Cadillac.</i>

07:06.458 --> 07:09.995
<i>Confused and scared,
Gio turned to his family.</i>

07:10.062 --> 07:12.698
<i>But I was beginning
to worry that this family</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:14.666
<i>and all of its traditions</i>

07:14.733 --> 07:17.403
<i>would hurt the boy
even further.</i>

07:17.469 --> 07:19.671
There he is, right there.

07:19.738 --> 07:21.106
<i>Today the storm
will begin as snow</i>

07:21.173 --> 07:23.442
<i>and change over
to a rainy mix.</i>

07:25.811 --> 07:30.049
Hey, Gio. Come over here.
How you holding up, Gio?

07:30.115 --> 07:31.316
I'm okay.

07:31.383 --> 07:33.786
Hey, Ricardo, I'll catch up
with you later.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.324
What'd I say
about slamming the door?

07:39.391 --> 07:41.693
All right, Gio.
Say hi to your mother for me.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.030
All right, Uncle Ricardo.

07:45.097 --> 07:48.333
Put that on.
You're gonna catch a cold.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.935
Your mother's worried sick
about you, man.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.637
She don't need to worry
about you in a T-shirt.

07:51.703 --> 07:52.838
I had to get out
of the house.

07:52.905 --> 07:56.141
Yeah? Hey.
Let me see that eye.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.845
<i>Marone.</i>

07:59.912 --> 08:01.213
- I'm okay.
- You're okay?

08:01.280 --> 08:04.683
- I'm okay, Leo. I'm okay.
- Gio...

08:14.660 --> 08:16.128
Leo, for real, man,
I got to get home.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.932
Hey, hey, trust me.
This will only take a minute.

08:19.998 --> 08:23.802
Gio, listen,
those the guys that jumped you?

08:23.869 --> 08:25.270
- No.
- Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

08:25.337 --> 08:26.972
Come here. Come here.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.841
I would never
let anyone hurt you.

08:28.907 --> 08:31.143
You know that, right?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.678
Right?

08:40.185 --> 08:45.090
Hey, um, what is it... you
remember your dog Sparks, man?

08:45.157 --> 08:49.027
That little fucking dog?
He tore up your ma's place?

08:49.094 --> 08:51.797
You loved that dog so much.

08:53.265 --> 08:56.802
Did you forget
what your old man said to you

08:56.869 --> 09:00.272
if you wanted to keep the dog?

09:00.339 --> 09:03.775
He told you, if you train it,
you can keep it.

09:03.842 --> 09:06.211
And what did he give
to you, huh?

09:08.947 --> 09:10.449
Gave you that water gun.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.785
Told you to shoot them in the
face every time he misbehaves.

09:18.857 --> 09:21.260
After a while,
Sparks started to listen.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.729
Yeah?

09:23.795 --> 09:26.899
This is no different.

09:26.965 --> 09:29.101
If you want those animals
to stop,

09:29.168 --> 09:30.637
you got to treat them
the same way.

09:30.702 --> 09:32.738
It's for their own good.

09:35.507 --> 09:39.311
Gah, come on. Look. Look.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.581
- I want to go home.
- I know you do. I know you do.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.984
But this is important.

09:46.051 --> 09:50.489
Look, your pops
ain't around no more.

09:50.556 --> 09:54.927
And I ain't always gonna be
there to protect you either.

09:54.993 --> 09:58.096
You got to learn
to look out for yourself.

09:59.898 --> 10:02.501
No one gonna protect you
like you can, okay?

10:02.568 --> 10:04.736
Not Angelo.

10:04.803 --> 10:09.074
Not me. Just you.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.943
Now go.

10:11.009 --> 10:13.111
Just like we talked about.

10:14.980 --> 10:19.084
Just like Sparks, man.
Just like Sparks...

10:19.151 --> 10:20.586
Gio.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.530
Attaboy.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.844
Back for more,
little dago fuck?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.579
Yeah, you fucking are back

10:47.647 --> 10:49.781
for more, huh,
you little bitch?

10:56.922 --> 10:59.424
Oh shit, he's got a gun.

11:00.727 --> 11:04.129
Whoa. Whoa. What?

11:04.196 --> 11:06.999
You think you're fucking
funny-fucking funny, huh?

11:08.567 --> 11:12.337
You think 'cause your uncle
Angelo runs this shit,

11:12.404 --> 11:13.939
you're fucking hard?

11:17.476 --> 11:20.713
Bitch.

11:25.284 --> 11:28.053
Gio! Run!

12:08.593 --> 12:09.796
Leo. Hey.

12:09.861 --> 12:11.330
I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.498
Those guys stopped by and
grabbed me on the street again.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.300
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Asking all these questions.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.302
- <i>What about?</i>
- What do you mean what about?

12:17.369 --> 12:18.771
About you.
Did you go see Uncle Angelo?

12:18.837 --> 12:20.740
- Did you talk to him?
- <i>Yo, chill.</i>

12:20.807 --> 12:22.207
What the fuck
is going on, man?

12:22.274 --> 12:23.575
- <i>Let's get together and talk.</i>
- What?

12:23.643 --> 12:25.143
<i>Come by Camila's.
You remember?</i>

12:25.210 --> 12:26.545
Yeah. Yeah.
Camila, the Puerto Rican girl.

12:26.612 --> 12:27.780
Yeah, I remember.

12:27.846 --> 12:29.014
- <i>Meet me there.</i>
- Okay.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.382
- <i>You remember where it is?</i>
- Yeah.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.617
It's a few blocks
from Angelo's, right?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.018
- <i>Yeah. Come by.</i>
- Okay.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.386
<i>We good.</i>

12:34.453 --> 12:35.454
Okay, yeah, I'll come by.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.155
From there, we go
to Angelo's, all right?

12:37.222 --> 12:38.857
Is that your cousin
on the phone?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.827
Ma, I could have been
naked in here.

12:40.892 --> 12:42.961
Oh, please. Hello. Leonardo.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.798
Ma. Ma. He hung up.
He hung up already.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.502
You know that I had coffee
with his mother yesterday,

12:50.569 --> 12:55.073
and she told me that Leonardo
has not gone to see her yet.,

12:55.140 --> 12:56.908
Yeah, well, he's going
through a lot right now.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.644
Oh, is that right?

12:58.711 --> 12:59.945
Look, what do you think, Ma?

13:00.011 --> 13:01.580
He's not gonna go see
his own mother?

13:01.647 --> 13:03.181
Just give him a minute, okay?

13:03.248 --> 13:04.950
I don't know. I don't know.

13:05.016 --> 13:06.418
What do you mean
you don't know?

13:06.485 --> 13:08.987
Look at me.
Look at me.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.123
Okay.

13:11.189 --> 13:13.592
- I look good, right?
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

13:19.498 --> 13:24.436
What business does he have
getting mixed up with drugs?

13:24.503 --> 13:26.571
Look, Uncle Ricardo said he's
gonna take care of everything.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.973
Okay?

13:28.039 --> 13:29.408
Everything's gonna be fine.
He promised.

13:29.474 --> 13:31.677
Uncle Ricardo.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.145
Well, he might be a cop.

13:33.211 --> 13:35.514
That doesn't mean
he's a good one.

13:37.516 --> 13:41.420
Leonardo has been a saint
to this family

13:41.486 --> 13:44.523
ever since we lost your father.

13:44.589 --> 13:47.492
More than my own brother,
that's for sure.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.029
But what's going on
out there...

13:51.096 --> 13:54.266
the cops, the drugs...

13:54.332 --> 13:57.002
Giovanni, listen to me.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.471
- This never ends well.
- Okay, Ma.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.206
You got to calm down.
You got to calm down.

14:01.273 --> 14:02.708
You're gonna give us
both a heart attack.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.610
- I'm calm. I'm calm.
- Okay, good. good.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.778
Deep breaths, remember?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.579
- Calm.
- Deep breaths.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.516
I got something for you.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.118
Yeah, okay.

14:59.866 --> 15:03.435
Oh.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.672
When you were little,
your father would always do

15:06.739 --> 15:09.174
the tie for you.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.077
And I would say to him,
"Sam, teach him.

15:12.143 --> 15:15.013
He wants to learn."

15:15.080 --> 15:17.215
But he wouldn't hear me.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.251
He would say,

15:19.317 --> 15:21.988
"Sofia, sweetheart...

15:22.053 --> 15:25.123
"I don't want to teach him...

15:25.190 --> 15:27.927
'cause then he won't need me."

15:30.830 --> 15:32.632
Mm.

15:32.698 --> 15:36.368
Your father loved dancing
to this song.

15:36.434 --> 15:38.136
And when he proposed...

15:38.203 --> 15:40.438
Yeah, when he asked you
to marry him, he...

15:42.040 --> 15:44.175
And when he pulled you
back up,

15:44.242 --> 15:45.577
the ring was already
on your finger.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.579
Yep.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.882
Well...

15:49.949 --> 15:53.251
Oh, I know you heard
the story a billion times,

15:53.318 --> 15:57.957
but it does make me
happy remembering it...

15:58.024 --> 15:59.825
especially today.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.595
Yeah, me too, Ma.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.630
Gio.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.334
I was going through
this old photo box,

16:09.401 --> 16:11.169
looking for some baby pictures

16:11.236 --> 16:14.573
for your cousin
Marie's wedding.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.742
And, um...

16:16.809 --> 16:19.645
I found these
at the bottom of the box.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.249
Your father bought them
for you

16:24.316 --> 16:28.119
right before we lost him.

16:28.186 --> 16:31.523
He had them made in Miami,

16:31.590 --> 16:35.160
when he was down there
with your uncle Angelo.

16:37.095 --> 16:38.664
But, uh...

16:41.667 --> 16:45.170
He never had the chance
to give them to you.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.008
So...

16:49.075 --> 16:51.777
Merry Christmas, son.

16:58.216 --> 16:59.919
Hey.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.787
Maybe you want to come tonight,

17:01.854 --> 17:04.255
you know, maybe towards
the end, just for a little bit,

17:04.322 --> 17:05.891
just to say hi to the family.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.359
I don't know.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.032
It's the ten-year, Ma.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.172
It's Uncle Angelo.
I got to take this.

17:21.239 --> 17:22.374
I love you so much.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.744
Hey, Uncle Angelo.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.647
Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.347
What? Yeah, okay.

17:29.414 --> 17:31.951
Jesus Christ. Hold on.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.386
I'll take care of it. Bye.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.658
Butter.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.459
He needs butter
to make the gravy, I guess.

17:41.526 --> 17:43.129
You know, wants me to hurry up.

17:43.194 --> 17:44.730
- Butter, huh?
- Yeah.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.267
Okay. Shit.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.436
Language.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.039
Sorry.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.707
All right.

17:56.441 --> 17:58.376
How do I look?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.379
You gonna be okay tonight?

18:01.446 --> 18:04.617
Yeah. I'll be just fine.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.919
Okay. All right, I love you.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.089
Bye.

18:10.856 --> 18:14.259
Hey.
Don't forget to go to church

18:14.325 --> 18:15.861
and light a candle
for your father, okay?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.562
Ma, I'll just go with you
in the morning, all right?

18:17.630 --> 18:20.331
- I don't have much time.
- No, Gio.

18:20.398 --> 18:22.935
You have to go tonight
and light the candle.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.037
And say hi to Father Kelly.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.272
And don't forget the cake.

18:27.338 --> 18:29.775
Okay. Got it.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.180
Huh?

18:34.245 --> 18:37.183
You don't have to do this
anymore, Ma.

18:37.248 --> 18:40.886
I don't make it for them.
I make it for your father.

18:40.953 --> 18:41.987
Yeah.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.489
And you make me carry it.
It's embarrassing.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.291
I'm not a kid anymore,
you know.

18:46.357 --> 18:49.829
You're embarrassed by a cake?
Get out of here.

18:59.404 --> 19:00.572
- Hey.
- Hey, Gio.

19:00.639 --> 19:04.210
- You look handsome.
- Oh, thanks. Bye.

19:04.275 --> 19:07.312
Have a good night.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.599
What the fuck?

19:27.666 --> 19:31.737
Hey, listen, we need to talk.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.538
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.174
You know where
the fuck you are?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.512
Come on, man.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.349
Yo, Gio. Where you going?

19:44.415 --> 19:45.851
Where's your cousin?

19:45.918 --> 19:49.587
Yeah. Where is Leo?
Some shit's happening.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.257
Then fucking call him.
I don't know.

19:51.322 --> 19:52.792
- Cut the bullshit.
- Come on.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.760
You and I both know
your cousin's been paying

19:54.827 --> 19:56.729
for you and your mother's rent
for years now with dirty money.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.130
- No.
- So if I were you,

19:58.197 --> 20:00.298
I'd be very careful about how
you talk to us right now.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.333
I promise you, I will lock both
you and your mommy up

20:02.400 --> 20:03.636
in prison.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.704
You want your mom
to go to prison?

20:05.771 --> 20:07.372
Oh, you scumbag.

20:07.438 --> 20:09.742
Just tell me,
where the fuck is Leo?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.110
I don't know
where he's at, okay?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.045
I haven't seen him
since he got out, okay?

20:14.312 --> 20:16.148
Hold on.
Let me take this with me.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.448
Hey. Hey.

20:17.515 --> 20:19.652
Hey. Hey. Agent P.
What do you think?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.486
Think the young man
is being honest with us?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.289
Who the fuck is this guy?

20:23.354 --> 20:24.757
I'm your friend.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.497
Who is that?

20:32.564 --> 20:35.634
That your friend, too?
You recognize that car?

20:35.701 --> 20:37.169
- I got to go.
- Who's in that car?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.604
- I don't know.
- Hey.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.873
Hold on. I'll tell you
who I think it was.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.209
I think it was
your uncle Angelo's guys.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.376
Huh?

20:45.443 --> 20:47.646
Gio. Gio.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.749
It's time to make
some right decisions.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.552
How do you know your cousin
hasn't already flipped?

20:54.620 --> 20:55.955
A tough guy like Leo...

20:56.021 --> 20:59.490
we made him flip
for, what, five kilos?

20:59.557 --> 21:02.493
What do you think
we can make you flip for?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.495
Maybe protect your mother?

21:04.562 --> 21:08.000
Hey. Use your head.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.401
You don't think
Angelo knows that?

21:14.539 --> 21:16.242
If we don't hear
from your cousin

21:16.308 --> 21:20.312
by tonight, it's not good.

21:20.378 --> 21:21.914
Okay.

21:21.981 --> 21:26.285
I'm gonna call you. Just please
don't come back here.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.153
Be smart, Gio.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.526
Leo, Leo, those FBI guys
just showed up at my place.

21:35.593 --> 21:36.896
Man, they threatened
my fucking mom.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.697
<i>Listen, if those feds
had anything,</i>

21:38.764 --> 21:40.900
- <i>you'd be in cuffs right now.</i>
- All right. Fuck.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.600
Look, just... you got to tell
Uncle Angelo, all right?

21:42.668 --> 21:44.103
You got... you got
to let him help you.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.238
- <i>Don't tell Angelo nothing.</i>
- Yeah. Right.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.740
Look, I won't say nothing.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.609
Okay, just please be
at Camila's place, okay?

21:50.676 --> 21:51.977
So we can figure this out.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.012
<i>They're cops.</i>

21:53.078 --> 21:54.579
- <i>They're fucking with you.</i>
- Yeah.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.981
- <i>Trust me.</i>
- I trust you.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.183
- <i>Don't say nothing.</i>
- Okay. I trust you.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.986
<i>I'll see you tonight.
And pick me up some smokes.</i>

22:05.991 --> 22:08.526
<i>Last month
Leo was pulled over in Jersey,</i>

22:08.593 --> 22:12.331
<i>and the police found five
kilos of heroin in his trunk.</i>

22:12.398 --> 22:15.234
<i>The FBI picked up the case,
and soon after,</i>

22:15.301 --> 22:16.635
<i>Leo was released,</i>

22:16.702 --> 22:19.805
<i>whereupon he disappeared
almost immediately.</i>

22:19.872 --> 22:23.642
<i>He asked Gio to buy him some
time to figure things out.</i>

22:23.709 --> 22:25.411
<i>But Gio knew he couldn't
protect his cousin</i>

22:25.476 --> 22:26.712
<i>for much longer.</i>

22:28.280 --> 22:29.715
- I can't take this!
- Yes, you fucking can!

22:29.782 --> 22:31.116
What am I supposed
to do with this?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.318
What do you mean?

22:32.384 --> 22:33.518
- It's worthless.
- Yeah, fuck you!

22:33.584 --> 22:34.820
- Hey. Hey!
- Fuck that.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.288
- I mean, fuck that shit!
- Get the fuck out!

22:36.355 --> 22:37.555
- No, fuck you, bitch!
- Get the fuck out!

22:37.623 --> 22:39.124
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.558
And what the fuck
are you looking at?

22:40.626 --> 22:43.295
Huh? Pussy. Pussy!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.698
- Get the fuck out.
- You ain't finna do shit!

22:51.303 --> 22:52.537
Crazy.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.307
Hey, can I get some
Parliament Lights?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.809
And you guys got butter?

22:56.875 --> 23:01.013
- It's in the back.
- Let me get a lighter, too.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.215
Just give me 20.
It's fine.

23:07.585 --> 23:09.221
Yellow.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.760
Hey, Flacko.
How you doing, man?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.930
You pass me
one of those butters?

23:19.131 --> 23:20.966
Hey, yo, Flacko.
Will you pass me a butter?

23:21.033 --> 23:23.534
They melted.
The fridge is broke.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.770
What do you mean?

23:24.837 --> 23:27.473
What, they all melted?
All of them?

23:27.538 --> 23:29.507
Whoa, man, what happened
to your face?

23:29.574 --> 23:30.976
- What happened?
- Yeah.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.646
Fucking Russians happened.
What do you think, B?

23:34.713 --> 23:35.948
I don't know.
I thought Angelo...

23:36.015 --> 23:37.883
No, listen.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.351
Your uncle has been
running shit

23:39.418 --> 23:42.254
out the back my whole life,
and this is what I get?

23:42.321 --> 23:44.289
I thought he was supposed
to be looking out.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.158
Look at my face, bro.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.359
Sorry, man.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.962
These fucking too-tight-
T-shirt-wearing Russians

23:50.029 --> 23:51.797
came down here
from Brighton Beach

23:51.864 --> 23:54.233
to break my dad's refrigerator
and break my fucking face,

23:54.299 --> 23:56.735
'cause we don't want to sell?

23:56.802 --> 23:58.237
It's not even
the fucking Russians no more.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.471
You got the fucking Hasids

23:59.537 --> 24:00.906
coming down here
from Crown Heights,

24:00.973 --> 24:02.741
who mad 'cause we don't want
to sell their flowers.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.376
Fuck those Hasids.
And you know what?

24:04.443 --> 24:07.112
Fuck those weed-smoking
dreadlock-ass Jamaicans

24:07.179 --> 24:08.447
from Flatbush,

24:08.514 --> 24:10.215
who mad 'cause we don't want
to sell their fresh produce.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.351
Ain't nobody trying
to buy no jackfruit

24:12.418 --> 24:13.752
or incense up in here.

24:13.819 --> 24:15.187
- Fuck them, man! Fuck them!
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.822
- Look, I didn't know, man.
- No.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.891
You know what, Gio?
Fuck you.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.659
Nah, B, you ain't getting
no fucking butter.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.194
Get the fuck out of here.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.829
Look, Flacko, I'll go talk
to Angelo right now.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.563
Your family's fucking up.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.865
Get out.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.602
Get out.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.644
Yo, my guy.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.612
You got any kombucha?

24:40.679 --> 24:43.382
We don't carry no fucking
kam-bucha!

24:53.492 --> 24:55.593
"Just chill"?

24:55.661 --> 24:58.163
"Relax"?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.665
Okay, Leo.

25:28.694 --> 25:32.364
Oh, Peeno. Let me pay you.
Here, take it.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.032
- I can't take that.
- Don't let her pay.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.634
Let me. Take it.
Take it. I want to...

25:35.701 --> 25:37.769
- Bitch, you're not paying.
- Take it. Let me pay you.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.238
She is not... you're
not paying.

25:39.304 --> 25:41.106
- I told her that.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.175
Stop it.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.176
Give me that.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.077
Marie, go. Go.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.245
Congratulations.
Have a good night.

25:46.311 --> 25:47.913
My husband's gonna
pick up this bill.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.149
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.584
- Angelo has got this.
- Please thank Angelo for me.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.219
- Of course, baby.
- Bye, Peeno.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.854
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:55.921 --> 25:56.955
- Come on, let's go.
- Congratulations.

25:57.022 --> 25:58.257
- Come with us.
- Here, here.

25:58.323 --> 25:59.691
I'll take you to the car.

26:03.795 --> 26:05.564
Aunt Emma?

26:05.632 --> 26:07.766
- Hey.
- Gio.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.034
Hey, what's going on?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.369
Oh, my God,
you're so handsome.

26:10.435 --> 26:13.038
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, it's been too long.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.240
You can't leave
this shit here.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.675
How are you?

26:16.742 --> 26:19.711
- I'm good. I'm good.
- How's your mom?

26:19.778 --> 26:21.180
It's the cake.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.981
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.284
Angelo's looks so forward
to this every single year.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.890
One dick to go, please.

26:31.957 --> 26:35.227
Please tell Sofia I miss her.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.529
- I will. I will.
- We all miss her.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.398
Hey, what's going on tonight?
What are you guys...

26:39.464 --> 26:41.300
Well, it's a bit
of a bachelorette party.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.469
Hey. Good. How are you?
Good to see you.

26:44.536 --> 26:45.672
- Yeah.
- You got to promise me.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.172
Uncle Bootsy, no,
I can't take it.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.707
- You can't have him drink.
- Okay. All right.

26:48.774 --> 26:49.875
- You know he's crazy.
- I know.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.043
I know. He's a maniac.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.578
- He's a lunatic.
- I know.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.347
- Drives me crazy.
- Yeah. Okay. I'll watch him.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.882
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.383
All right. Bye, guys.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.687
- Please send Sofia my love.
- Okay, Aunt Emma. I will.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.821
- We miss you.
- I will. Miss you, too.

27:02.888 --> 27:03.956
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Marie.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.457
Have fun.
Congratulations.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.293
- Hi, Gio.
- See you.

27:11.563 --> 27:14.066
Good night, ladies.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.301
Hey, man. How you doing?
What's going on?

27:18.103 --> 27:20.138
I'm good, man. Good.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.740
I'm working.
It's the same shit, you know.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.008
They working you overtime?

27:23.075 --> 27:25.043
You look a little
stressed, man.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.581
You look like Frankie Valli.
What's with the fucking suit?

27:29.649 --> 27:31.984
Hey. Hey.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.453
I'm going over to my uncle's.
Got a family thing.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.154
- Angelo's.
- Yeah.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.823
Fuck, Gio.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.329
You know this spot.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.569
This is where...

27:50.637 --> 27:54.506
this is where
Angelo got shot in the throat.

27:54.573 --> 27:57.409
I know. That's crazy.

28:02.615 --> 28:05.450
- Hey, Pam.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.952
Did they fucking leave?

28:07.019 --> 28:09.221
Pam, you know you can't have
that out here.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.856
Come on. Come on.
Give it to me.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.157
Give it to me, please.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.960
- Fuck you, Peeno.
- Thank you.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.029
- Hey, Pam, you got a...
- Fucking bitches left me?

28:17.095 --> 28:19.364
- Thing on your shoe.
- Taxi!

28:20.700 --> 28:22.534
Hey, brother.
Hang on. Hang on.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.975
Yeah, man.
Hey, Peeno, I got to...

28:30.042 --> 28:32.377
Hang on a second.
Come here.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.112
What's up?

28:34.179 --> 28:37.149
Don't look, but these two guys
in the front,

28:37.215 --> 28:40.653
these two Puerto Rican guys
at the bar, you see them?

28:40.720 --> 28:42.587
- Yeah.
- You know them?

28:42.655 --> 28:45.557
No. No. Why?

28:45.625 --> 28:47.627
They've been posted up
at the bar all day.

28:47.694 --> 28:49.696
I've been serving them drinks.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.998
I think... I think I heard them
say something about Leo.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.368
Leo? What?
What were they saying?

28:57.936 --> 28:59.171
I don't know.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.606
I don't know.
My Spanish isn't shit.

29:00.673 --> 29:05.110
But it didn't sound like
regular homey shit, you know.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.013
I think something might be up.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.514
Yeah, well, you know,
Leo's been hanging out

29:09.581 --> 29:11.283
with that Puerto Rican girl,
Camila.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.585
So I'm sure it's just... like,
her ex-boyfriend's crazy

29:13.653 --> 29:14.787
and shit, you know.

29:14.853 --> 29:17.923
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

29:17.989 --> 29:19.358
- Camila?
- Yeah.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.527
They've been hanging out
for a while now.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.464
Well, I guess
who gives a fuck, right?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.532
- Yeah. It's all good.
- I should get back to work.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.435
All right, man.
Good to see you. Take care.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.479
Hey. Yo. Gio.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.014
Hey, lock the door
behind you, yeah?

30:16.081 --> 30:18.116
Yeah.

30:21.621 --> 30:24.022
- Tommy, how you doing?
- Hey, man, nice to see you.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.425
- Hey, Diane.
- Hey, Gio.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.393
I didn't know
you were coming in tonight.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.461
Yeah.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.230
Relax.
You don't want to lose count.

30:32.297 --> 30:35.500
Hey, Miss Tucci,
you got a winner tonight?

30:35.567 --> 30:39.404
- Oops. Guess I lost count.
- Oh, yeah, I bet you did.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.173
Hey, why don't you
let Gio do it?

30:41.239 --> 30:42.675
He's good with money.

30:42.742 --> 30:44.976
Hey, speaking of,
isn't it Hanukkah or some shit?

30:45.043 --> 30:46.511
I didn't know
you was Jewish, Gio.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.213
Yeah, well, technically, no,
I mean, my old man was.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.782
All right, quit fucking
distracting her.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.284
We're gonna be here all night.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.821
I saw your cousin Marie
with Lee and Claire last night.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.955
Them girls looked lit up
like a fucking Christmas tree.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.323
Yeah, that makes sense.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.158
You know, I know
I've said it a million times,

31:00.225 --> 31:02.027
but I can't stand
your fucking uncle Angelo.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.396
- What a fucking prick, man.
- Yeah, what'd he do this time?

31:04.463 --> 31:06.131
Well, I come over to say hi,

31:06.198 --> 31:07.966
you know, like normal,
out of respect.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.569
I sit down with him for a few,
and then every fucking time

31:10.636 --> 31:12.805
I say something, he either
doesn't say nothing back,

31:12.872 --> 31:14.139
or he cuts me off.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.708
He doesn't look at me,
not even once.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.777
When he brings shots
back to the table,

31:17.844 --> 31:19.377
he acts like he miscounted.

31:19.444 --> 31:20.813
He's just busting your balls.
He don't mean nothing by it.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.581
Yeah, whatever, man.
He's corny, all right?

31:22.648 --> 31:25.885
And I don't trust him.
I got my reasons. Trust me.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.519
Yeah, why you
always say that?

31:27.586 --> 31:29.187
Come on, Gio,
even your mother

31:29.254 --> 31:31.189
doesn't fuck with him,
and that's her brother.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.997
- Hey, Tommy.
- Yo.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.734
You ever feel like... I don't
know, like the right thing

31:41.801 --> 31:43.669
and the wrong thing
are the same sometimes?

31:43.736 --> 31:46.973
Like there's no difference?

31:47.038 --> 31:49.775
- Every fucking day.
- You do?

31:49.842 --> 31:51.276
Sure. Why not?

31:51.343 --> 31:55.146
It's like every time
I screw around on Tracey,

31:55.213 --> 31:57.482
I feel bad, you know?

31:57.549 --> 32:00.085
Like it feels like
the right thing at the time,

32:00.151 --> 32:03.188
but I know it's wrong.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.957
Jesus, Tommy,
that's your wife.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.291
All right, relax,
Father Kelly.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.760
I already got him
breathing down my neck

32:07.827 --> 32:09.127
every time I run into him.

32:10.696 --> 32:14.800
- Have a great night.
- Why you asking, anyway?

32:14.867 --> 32:17.737
No, these FBI guys
just stopped me on the street,

32:17.803 --> 32:19.404
- asking about Leo.
- What?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.306
You didn't talk to them,
did you?

32:21.373 --> 32:23.776
No. I mean, I spoke to them,
but I didn't say nothing.

32:23.843 --> 32:25.443
All right. No. No. No.
I don't want to know

32:25.510 --> 32:27.212
anything about that shit,
all right, Gio? Fuck.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.547
I'm not trying to get you
involved or anything,

32:28.614 --> 32:32.652
I'm just saying,
I don't know what to do.

32:32.718 --> 32:33.953
What a fucking moron.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.353
What the fuck was Leo

32:35.420 --> 32:39.057
doing moving dope
for those Puerto Ricans anyway?

32:39.124 --> 32:41.092
I mean, when he got busted,

32:41.159 --> 32:44.129
didn't he lose mad weight
for those guys?

32:44.195 --> 32:47.465
How the fuck's
he gonna pay them back?

32:47.532 --> 32:50.736
Everything's fucked up
right now, man.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.605
Listen, if I was you,

32:52.672 --> 32:55.041
I wouldn't repeat anything you
said about the feds to anyone.

32:55.106 --> 32:58.044
All right? No one. Especially
not your uncle Angelo.

33:10.823 --> 33:11.991
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.491
- You want to kill these?
- Oh, no,

33:13.558 --> 33:15.360
my throat would close up.
I can't eat that.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.128
- You allergic to chocolate?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.130
No, it sucks, right?

33:19.197 --> 33:21.600
- Seriously.
- I'm cursed or something.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.368
You want me to box
that up for you?

33:23.435 --> 33:24.502
Yeah, you know, why not?

33:24.569 --> 33:25.972
- It someone's birthday?
- Yeah.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.808
Jesus, next week. Just box
the fucking cake, Diane.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.543
- It was my dad's birthday.
- Oh, nice.

33:31.611 --> 33:32.845
Tell him I said
happy birthday.

33:32.912 --> 33:34.479
Jesus, Diane,
will you shut the fuck up?

33:34.546 --> 33:37.083
He's dead, all right?

33:37.148 --> 33:39.384
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

33:40.987 --> 33:43.623
Hey, how many times I got to
tell you not to do that shit?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.562
Oh, shit.

33:50.630 --> 33:52.798
- Sacred Heart reunion.
- What's up, Tracey?

33:52.865 --> 33:55.133
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, what's up? How are you?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.669
- I got this.
- Yeah? Thanks.

33:56.736 --> 33:58.804
- Dude, Gio, how have you been?
- I'm all right. Yeah.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.339
Hanging in there. How are you?
How was Teresa's last night?

34:02.908 --> 34:05.878
- No, I wasn't at Teresa's.
- Oh, yeah. No, my bad.

34:05.945 --> 34:08.346
I thought maybe my cousin Marie
said she saw you there.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.049
Oh, wait, it's her
bachelorette tonight, right?

34:10.116 --> 34:11.383
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.818
God, I haven't seen that girl
in forever.

34:12.885 --> 34:16.588
- How is she?
- You know, I think she's okay.

34:16.656 --> 34:18.858
She's probably drunk
as fuck right now.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.726
Yeah, you know what?
I wanted to go out last night.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.361
But Tommy got too stoned
and passed out.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.731
Well, that weed he smokes
is no joke, you know?

34:25.798 --> 34:26.832
It'll put him in a coma.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.668
Coma or not,
we are going out tonight,

34:28.734 --> 34:30.603
or your BFF
can find another girl.

34:30.670 --> 34:31.971
Oh, yeah?
Who you gonna date?

34:32.038 --> 34:34.406
You should see the people
she hangs out with, Gio.

34:34.472 --> 34:35.775
What the fuck does that mean?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.643
All huddle up outside
of the Supreme Store?

34:37.710 --> 34:39.411
Still living with their mas?
No offense, Gio.

34:39.477 --> 34:41.179
Wow, the hating.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.848
God, I swear you
secretly hate everyone.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.449
No. No. No.
It's not a secret. I do.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.919
I hate everybody.
I hate... even Gio, I hate.

34:46.986 --> 34:49.855
What, me? Fuck, Tommy.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.524
- Here you go, Gio.
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.493
Little bow and everything.
Appreciate it.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.496
All right, guys,
I got to get going.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.365
- All right.
- I'm babysitting.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.103
Double duty.
But I'll see you around, Gio.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.938
All right, yeah,
see you around.

35:06.005 --> 35:09.942
Hey, you know what?
I'm gonna walk you out.

35:10.009 --> 35:12.277
- Hey, bye, Diane.
- Bye.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.815
You need help with this?

35:15.881 --> 35:18.516
Just get the fuck
out of here.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.386
Sorry that Tommy's
such a dick all the time.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.723
I don't know why
I put up with him.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.692
'Cause it's Tommy,
and you love him.

35:26.759 --> 35:28.359
And, you know, it doesn't hurt

35:28.426 --> 35:30.428
that he's best friends
with Gio.

35:30.495 --> 35:33.132
You like him?

35:33.199 --> 35:35.935
You know, maybe.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.269
- Slut.
- Whatever.

36:00.391 --> 36:02.862
What the fuck was that?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.897
I don't know,
but it was creepy.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.533
Okay, I got to go.
It's freezing.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.770
Bye, babe.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.440
Hey, uh, hey, Diane.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.777
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.613
I was just wondering if maybe
you want to get a drink

36:20.679 --> 36:22.782
with me, like,
next weekend or something?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.683
- Yeah. I'd like that.
- Yeah?

36:24.750 --> 36:27.887
- Yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.889
- I'll see you then.
- All right, good night. Yeah.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.356
- Bye.
- Get home safe, yeah?

36:31.422 --> 36:33.358
Man, Gio.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.428
What's going on with you?
You want to get a drink?

36:37.495 --> 36:38.864
Nah, I got
to go to my uncle's.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.901
Whoa. Whoa. Hey.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.303
I don't know
if you know this,

36:45.370 --> 36:47.372
but we actually had class

36:47.438 --> 36:51.177
together the year
you lost your pops.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.279
- Yeah, we did?
- Yeah.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.847
We didn't know each other.

36:54.914 --> 36:56.816
But I don't know,
I would stare at you in class,

36:56.882 --> 36:59.785
and I thought
that you would just shatter

36:59.852 --> 37:02.721
into a million pieces,
and you didn't.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.759
That's weird.
I don't remember that.

37:06.826 --> 37:09.662
Well, I hope you have
a good night.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.596
- Thanks, Trace.
- Yo, we got to go!

37:11.664 --> 37:13.165
- Tommy!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.401
- What the fuck? Oh, my God.
- Hey, you coming?

37:16.467 --> 37:18.103
- No. I'm just gonna walk.
- No, come on.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.638
You're going to your uncle's,
right? It's on the way.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.174
- Nah, it's fine, man.
- No, come on.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.076
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.680
Hey, yo, my man, my man,

37:27.746 --> 37:29.081
we're gonna make two stops now,
all right?

37:29.148 --> 37:30.481
He's gonna hope out
a couple blocks before us.

37:30.548 --> 37:31.917
Okay, you got it.

37:31.984 --> 37:35.386
Yeah, I'll tell you
where to go. Thanks.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.256
Tommy, slow down.
We have all night.

37:39.959 --> 37:42.261
Yo, guys, Diane and I just saw
some sketchy-ass

37:42.328 --> 37:43.696
Puerto Rican dudes drive
by the bakery.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.264
I don't know,
they were staring at you guys.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.497
It was really weird.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.133
- Are you serious?
- By the bakery?

37:48.200 --> 37:49.400
Yo, fuck that, Gio, man.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.970
Don't bring me
into your fucking drama.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.104
I don't need that shit.

37:52.171 --> 37:53.973
- I didn't do anything.
- All right, does someone

37:54.039 --> 37:55.708
want to tell me what the fuck
you guys are talking about?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.542
Yeah, real talk, Gio,
people are talking.

37:57.610 --> 37:59.612
Man, your cousin
really fucked up this time.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.314
What do you mean?
W-who's talking? What people?

38:02.380 --> 38:05.818
People, man, that's who.
People are fucking talking.

38:05.885 --> 38:07.552
Your uncle Angelo's
getting pissed off,

38:07.620 --> 38:09.121
and now the fucking
Puerto Ricans are involved?

38:09.188 --> 38:10.555
- Yo, my man.
- Yeah.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.157
Not for nothing,
but I'm Puerto Rican,

38:12.224 --> 38:13.726
and I'm proud, okay?

38:13.792 --> 38:16.195
So what, man? Who asked you?
You want a fucking cookie?

38:16.262 --> 38:17.595
- A fucking cookie?
- Chill.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.298
Tommy, chill out.
You're so fucking intense.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.066
Man, fuck this bullshit, man.
I'm trying to get fucked up.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.768
You're an animal,
you know that?

38:22.835 --> 38:24.069
Mm-hmm.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.337
Hey, I'm just gonna hop out
right here, okay?

38:25.403 --> 38:26.537
Yeah, you do that. Thank you.

38:26.605 --> 38:27.840
- Later, Trace.
- Good to see you.

38:27.907 --> 38:29.440
- See you later, Tommy.
- Yeah, whatever.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.644
Thank you.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.113
What the fuck's your problem?

38:34.179 --> 38:36.547
What's all this shit
all about "people are talking"?

38:36.615 --> 38:37.983
Huh? How do you know?

38:38.050 --> 38:39.084
'Cause I fucking know.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.020
- 'Cause I'm not fucking blind.
- Oh.

38:41.086 --> 38:42.721
It's 'cause you hang out
at Siriso's. That's why.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.555
So what? I can't hang out
at Siriso's now?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.524
Yeah. I don't want you
hanging out

38:46.591 --> 38:47.960
- with fucking mobsters.
- Mobsters?

38:48.027 --> 38:49.295
I'm not the one you
got to worry about.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.363
Gio's the one that's getting
all mixed up in this shit

38:51.429 --> 38:52.731
with his stupid-ass cousin.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.301
Gio's not the type.
You know what?

38:55.367 --> 38:56.969
If he is in trouble,
you're not fucking helping.

38:57.036 --> 38:59.038
Don't twist shit,
all right?

38:59.104 --> 39:00.806
If you would be straight up
with him for once,

39:00.873 --> 39:03.409
maybe he'd have a grip on shit.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.877
Yo, so it's my fault?

39:04.944 --> 39:06.645
it's my fault
that he's a fucking idiot?

39:06.712 --> 39:09.048
No, you're the fucking idiot.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.183
God, it's all your fault.

39:11.250 --> 39:13.319
Honestly, is he the only person
in this entire neighborhood

39:13.385 --> 39:15.187
that doesn't know what
the fuck happened to his dad?

39:15.254 --> 39:17.957
It's like I said, all right?
It's not my problem.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.793
I'm his friend, all right?
Not his fucking guardian angel.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.460
It's the real
fucking world, Tracey.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.929
Jesus.

39:23.996 --> 39:25.496
God, you're a fucking child,
you know that?

39:25.563 --> 39:26.899
Fuck you.

39:26.966 --> 39:28.901
Suck my dick, dude.
I fucking hate you.

39:28.968 --> 39:31.670
- Hey, uh, guys.
- Do another line.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.138
Guy, guys, guys,
I got this great book.

39:33.205 --> 39:36.075
- Huh?
- It's "30 Lessons for Loving."

39:36.141 --> 39:38.811
Check it out.
It saved my marriage.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.046
February makes 28 years
I'm married.

39:41.113 --> 39:43.382
- Do another fucking line.
- What the fuck?

39:43.449 --> 39:44.883
Hey. Hey.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.753
Let's take it easy, guys.
Come on.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.223
You guys hungry?

39:51.290 --> 39:52.590
- What?
- Seriously?

39:52.658 --> 39:53.926
No, I'm just saying,
in the book,

39:53.993 --> 39:55.627
there's a great chapter
that says

39:55.694 --> 39:57.229
don't get into a fight
if you're hungry.

39:57.296 --> 39:59.497
Before you say something nasty
to each other, like,

39:59.564 --> 40:01.100
put something
yummy in your mouth.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.533
Yo, man, just pull over here,
all right? I'm good.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.936
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
You're gonna leave?

40:04.003 --> 40:05.671
Yo, my man...
all right, I mean, look...

40:05.738 --> 40:07.806
- Yo, it's fine.
- Look, I know my wife says...

40:07.873 --> 40:09.507
- Unlock the fucking door.
- Really?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.643
- Go fuck your whores!
- What is that shit?

40:11.710 --> 40:15.347
That's gonna be
your ex-husband real soon.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.982
Where you going?
Where you going?

40:17.049 --> 40:18.417
You want me to take you to the
police station or something?

40:18.484 --> 40:20.419
Do you feel safe?

40:20.486 --> 40:22.087
Yo. Yo. Kick his ass.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.757
That's what I would do.
Kick his fucking ass.

40:28.327 --> 40:29.560
Ooh.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.196
<i>That song gives me
the chills.</i>

40:31.263 --> 40:33.564
<i>Hey, cool cats,
how you doing out there?</i>

40:33.632 --> 40:36.368
<i>What's going on?
Talk to me.</i>

40:36.435 --> 40:38.604
<i>I haven't seen this city
this stressed since 9/11.</i>

40:38.670 --> 40:40.172
Mmm.

40:40.239 --> 40:43.075
<i>These are scary,
desperate times, folks.</i>

40:43.142 --> 40:46.645
<i>So give me a call.
Let's start the conversation.</i>

40:46.712 --> 40:48.579
<i>I'm with it.
I'm feeling you.</i>

40:48.647 --> 40:50.716
<i>Phone lines are open
all night.</i>

40:50.783 --> 40:52.751
<i>Hope you're being safe...</i>

40:52.818 --> 40:56.822
Yo! What the fuck, bro?

40:56.889 --> 40:58.589
Hey, I'm sorry, man,
I forgot my cake.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.660
No shit, you forgot
your fucking cake.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.561
That's a good
fucking cake, man.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.531
I'd be lying to you
if I didn't tell you

41:05.596 --> 41:07.466
I was about
to destroy that shit.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.968
Would have messed up my night
and your night, but we good.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.470
All right. Thanks.
Hey, sorry.

41:11.537 --> 41:12.671
Homegrown, baby.

41:12.738 --> 41:13.839
- Nah, I'm all right.
- Sure?

41:13.906 --> 41:15.808
- Yeah. Have a great night.
- Okay.

41:17.910 --> 41:19.478
Take care, Vito Corleone.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.985
<i>Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens,
Manhattan,</i>

41:27.052 --> 41:29.922
<i>Staten Island, junkies,
hookers, pimps,</i>

41:29.988 --> 41:33.092
<i>hustlers, cops, robbers,
and superheroes.</i>

41:33.158 --> 41:34.860
<i>You don't know
what I'm talking about,</i>

41:34.927 --> 41:36.562
<i>then you don't know this city.</i>

41:36.628 --> 41:37.963
<i>This one is for all of you</i>

41:38.030 --> 41:41.166
<i>walking those streets,
keeping the dream alive.</i>

41:46.305 --> 41:47.773
Hey. How are you?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.741
They having a fucking party
in there?

41:49.808 --> 41:52.177
No, I don't think so.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.584
- I don't think he can hear me.
- Cops were just here.

42:00.486 --> 42:02.054
- What?
- Yeah.

42:02.121 --> 42:04.823
I can spot an undercover
from a mile away.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.191
I know that bitch
is out of town,

42:06.258 --> 42:08.026
and she can't be Airbnb-ing
this shit out

42:08.093 --> 42:09.928
to a bunch of hood rats
or whatever.

42:09.995 --> 42:12.664
You tell them that.
All right?

42:12.731 --> 42:15.767
I don't need no cops up
in my business.

42:15.834 --> 42:19.204
Yeah, okay. I'll tell her.

42:19.271 --> 42:22.107
It's open. Sorry.

42:22.174 --> 42:24.476
Yeah, turn it fucking
down in there!

42:24.543 --> 42:26.011
Show some class!

42:26.078 --> 42:27.379
Leo!

42:29.481 --> 42:31.383
Leo, you upstairs?

42:39.725 --> 42:41.093
Leo.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.062
Neighbor's about to call
the cops on your dumb ass.

42:48.834 --> 42:51.670
Hey, buddy. How are you? Hi.

42:51.737 --> 42:55.007
Leo.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.242
Leo, where you at?
You downstairs?

43:14.793 --> 43:16.762
Leo.

43:19.298 --> 43:21.433
Yo, man, where
the fuck is he?

43:21.500 --> 43:23.769
He's here, man. He's here.
I promise.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.775
Shut that fucking dog up.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.210
Video game's on.

43:35.914 --> 43:38.116
See that? I told you,
he's here, all right?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.919
Okay. Well, let's keep
searching, man.

43:43.388 --> 43:46.158
Hey, Leo.

43:46.225 --> 43:48.427
- Where is he?
- He probably just stepped out

43:48.493 --> 43:49.962
to get something to eat.

43:50.028 --> 43:52.898
I don't know, man, but, look,
I did what you asked.

43:52.965 --> 43:55.267
I brought you to Leo.

43:55.334 --> 43:57.402
Can we... can we...
can we settle up?

44:00.707 --> 44:02.241
- You want to settle?
- Yeah.

44:02.307 --> 44:06.345
This clown wants to settle.
Yeah, it's funny, right?

44:06.411 --> 44:08.080
Yeah, let's settle.
Let's settle.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.383
Okay. Yeah. See that?

44:15.287 --> 44:17.322
All right.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.324
Papa, settle it.

44:19.391 --> 44:21.694
You want to settle up,
papito?

44:21.760 --> 44:24.162
Here, this is for you,
all right?

44:24.229 --> 44:25.665
<i>Toma.</i>

44:27.734 --> 44:30.335
It's all you, papa.
All for you.

44:36.408 --> 44:40.078
Yo, you guys aren't
gonna hurt him, right?

44:40.145 --> 44:43.849
Man, do we look like
we hurt people, my brother?

44:43.915 --> 44:46.619
Yo, look at me.
We're businessmen.

44:50.155 --> 44:51.823
You know that me and Leo
go way back, right?

44:51.890 --> 44:54.159
He's a good guy.
You're gonna see that.

44:54.226 --> 44:56.828
He...

44:56.895 --> 44:59.464
Look, man, I'm just about peace
and love, you know what I mean?

44:59.531 --> 45:01.133
Peace and love.
We were 12 years old.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.567
We're talking about
bridging the gap

45:02.635 --> 45:04.069
between the neighborhoods,
you know what I mean?

45:04.136 --> 45:05.037
- Yeah.
- So you guys got

45:05.103 --> 45:07.774
what you need, all right?

45:07.839 --> 45:10.842
Where you going, my man?

45:10.909 --> 45:12.878
Back here.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.683
Bro. Bro. Bro.

45:16.749 --> 45:20.419
I'm tired of fucking
chasing you and Leo around.

45:20.485 --> 45:21.853
Where the fuck is Leo?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.791
Enough games, yo.

45:24.890 --> 45:27.092
Shut that fucking dog up.

45:27.159 --> 45:28.927
Please.
You don't need to do this.

45:28.994 --> 45:31.563
Shh.
Shut the fuck up.

45:35.867 --> 45:37.737
Fuck, man!

46:07.532 --> 46:10.602
<i>Gio knew Peeno
was no stranger to trouble.</i>

46:10.670 --> 46:11.903
<i>He'd had a gun pulled on him</i>

46:11.970 --> 46:14.741
<i>once or twice before
at the bar.</i>

46:14.807 --> 46:17.909
<i>But why would he sell Leo
out like that?</i>

46:17.976 --> 46:20.278
<i>For what? Drugs?</i>

46:21.546 --> 46:24.717
<i>The neighborhood
had changed so much.</i>

46:24.784 --> 46:26.485
<i>Gio knew the people
who were looking for Leo</i>

46:26.551 --> 46:29.221
<i>weren't gonna stop
until they found him.</i>

46:29.287 --> 46:33.024
<i>And he couldn't go
to Angelo for help.</i>

46:33.091 --> 46:35.695
<i>He had to find his cousin.</i>

46:39.665 --> 46:41.734
- Whoa. Slow down.
- Hey. You seen Leo in here?

46:41.801 --> 46:42.869
My cousin?

46:42.934 --> 46:44.202
- Who?
- Leo. Leo.

46:44.269 --> 46:46.672
He just texted me,
said he was in here.

46:46.739 --> 46:48.340
I don't know.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.915
Hey.

46:56.982 --> 46:58.183
Hey. Excuse me.
Hey.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.018
Is Leo in here?
Did you see him?

47:00.085 --> 47:02.487
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Thank you so much.

47:08.326 --> 47:11.096
Gio. What the hell are you
doing here, huh?

47:11.163 --> 47:12.597
Look at this.
Look who I found. It's Gio.

47:12.665 --> 47:13.965
- Hey, Uncle Tony.
- This is perfect.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.200
We was headed over to Angelo's.

47:15.267 --> 47:16.535
You're gonna come
with us, right?

47:16.601 --> 47:18.370
Yeah. Yeah. The cake.
He brought the cake.

47:18.437 --> 47:19.839
<i>Marone,</i> your mother.
What a cook.

47:19.906 --> 47:21.072
I look forward
to this cake every year.

47:21.139 --> 47:22.340
Don't let him touch the cake.

47:22.407 --> 47:23.776
He'll eat
the thing before we get there.

47:23.843 --> 47:25.444
- What are you doing?
- Gonna grab the wine?

47:25.510 --> 47:27.012
What wine? They got cases
of wine at the house.

47:27.078 --> 47:28.380
It's a nice gesture.

47:28.447 --> 47:29.916
You know what, guys?
Hey, I forgot the butter.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.283
So I'm just gonna
meet you guys there.

47:31.349 --> 47:32.785
What are you talking about?
Forget about the butter.

47:32.852 --> 47:34.186
You don't need the butter.

47:34.252 --> 47:35.487
How'd you get here?
Where you coming from?

47:35.554 --> 47:37.322
You walked all this way
from your ma's?

47:37.389 --> 47:41.493
Yeah, I was just buying
some smokes, you know?

47:41.560 --> 47:44.162
What about... what
about Leo, your cousin?

47:44.229 --> 47:45.997
I mean, is he here?
Is he around? You talk to him?

47:46.064 --> 47:47.499
Where is this kid?

47:47.566 --> 47:49.434
You would think a day like
this, he should be with you.

47:49.501 --> 47:52.204
Yeah. I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.005
How are you doing?
You all right?

47:55.974 --> 47:58.276
You don't talk much,
do you, kid?

47:58.343 --> 47:59.978
It's been a long day,
Uncle Tony.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.414
Yeah. Yeah. I get it.
I understand.

48:04.549 --> 48:07.052
Oh, my God, look at this.
Look at this.

48:07.118 --> 48:10.121
Monica. Monica!

48:10.188 --> 48:13.558
You don't ever call me?
You like that?

48:13.626 --> 48:15.728
Hey, stugots! Let's go!

48:17.663 --> 48:19.297
Get down from there!

48:19.364 --> 48:21.901
Right here. Right here.

48:21.968 --> 48:24.871
What, you got a problem?

48:24.937 --> 48:26.839
You got a fucking problem? Huh?

48:26.906 --> 48:28.540
Go get him down.

48:28.608 --> 48:30.575
She's fucking
too good for me.

48:30.643 --> 48:33.111
What? What the fuck?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Monica.

48:33.178 --> 48:34.446
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry, you fucking drunk.

48:34.513 --> 48:36.147
Hey, don't talk
to the customers.

48:36.214 --> 48:37.282
- Come on. Come on.
- I got to tell you something.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.885
I got to tell you something.

48:38.951 --> 48:41.654
Don't you ever fucking tell me
what to do, you fucking mutt!

48:41.721 --> 48:44.456
Don't fucking talk to me.
I'm leaving, all right?

48:44.523 --> 48:46.391
I'm leaving.
Get the fuck away from me.

48:46.458 --> 48:48.059
- What's wrong with you?
- Monica, I love you.

48:48.126 --> 48:49.361
I'll call you later, baby.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.264
What's wrong with you?
Come on, kid.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.002
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

49:26.766 --> 49:28.266
Angelo.

49:30.002 --> 49:31.671
Hey, Ang.

49:38.010 --> 49:39.110
Hey.

49:45.818 --> 49:47.218
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

49:47.285 --> 49:48.420
You got a bottle
of wine, huh?

49:48.486 --> 49:49.855
- I did.
- What'd you pay...

49:49.922 --> 49:51.791
- 20 bucks for that?
- No. No. No. It's a good one.

49:51.857 --> 49:53.558
Please tell me,
you made the meatballs?

49:53.626 --> 49:55.160
Yeah, I did
all the cooking here.

49:55.226 --> 49:57.763
Oh. The cake, huh?

49:57.830 --> 49:58.764
Yeah.

49:58.831 --> 50:00.866
Your mother,
she never disappoints.

50:00.933 --> 50:02.133
Right, Ang?

50:02.200 --> 50:03.803
Now, that's a good woman,
your mother.

50:03.869 --> 50:04.804
Yeah, she is.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.741
- The butter.
- You know what?

50:08.808 --> 50:11.376
Yeah, the bodega
was having some problems.

50:11.443 --> 50:12.979
I can go get some right now.

50:13.045 --> 50:14.614
Don't worry about it.
Your Fat Uncle Bootsy

50:14.680 --> 50:16.448
brought enough
for the entire neighborhood.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.383
- You sure? It's two seconds.
- Yeah.

50:18.450 --> 50:20.285
What's the matter with this
kid? He's pale as a ghost.

50:20.352 --> 50:21.553
It's just been a long day,
that's all.

50:21.621 --> 50:24.122
Yeah. Well, good thing
your father's not around,

50:24.189 --> 50:26.157
'cause you smell
like an ashtray.

50:26.224 --> 50:27.359
Yeah.

50:30.328 --> 50:31.496
Hey, <i>ciao a tutti.</i>

50:31.563 --> 50:34.199
- Hey, kid.
- Happy holidays, Gio.

50:36.736 --> 50:38.871
Yeah.

50:38.938 --> 50:40.940
You know, when Angelo
was on the inside,

50:41.007 --> 50:43.174
your old man would send him
all these art books, you know?

50:43.241 --> 50:44.810
Let his mind escape.

50:44.877 --> 50:47.680
He got that one at an auction
just a couple of weeks ago.

50:47.747 --> 50:49.982
Hell of an investment,
you ask me.

50:50.049 --> 50:52.785
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty good,
Uncle Angelo.

50:52.852 --> 50:54.787
Pretty good? Forget about it.
It's a fucking masterpiece.

50:54.854 --> 50:57.455
Look at the water, the way it's
flowing down there in the canal

50:57.522 --> 50:59.859
and everything like that...
I don't know.

50:59.925 --> 51:01.359
Makes me want
to go back to Italy.

51:01.426 --> 51:02.762
Come on.
Where's he going?

51:02.828 --> 51:04.429
Let's go say hello
to your uncle Carmine.

51:04.496 --> 51:06.732
- Yeah, how's he doing?
- He's doing good.

51:15.841 --> 51:17.710
Hey, Uncle Carmine.

51:17.777 --> 51:19.411
How you doing?

51:23.049 --> 51:25.117
It's me, Gio.

51:25.183 --> 51:27.419
It's been a while, huh?

51:36.996 --> 51:39.264
Good to see you, all right?
Happy holidays, huh?

51:48.406 --> 51:49.875
She's fresh off the boat.

51:49.942 --> 51:51.610
She got the warpaint
on and everything.

51:51.677 --> 51:53.344
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

51:53.411 --> 51:55.147
You might as well
wear a headdress.

51:55.213 --> 51:57.482
They don't wear headdresses.
Those are the fucking Indians.

51:57.549 --> 51:58.851
- <i>Salut.</i>
- Oh.

51:58.918 --> 52:00.886
<i>Salut.</i>

52:00.953 --> 52:02.621
Shakedown today?

52:02.688 --> 52:04.890
- Need a drink.
- You came to drink?

52:07.525 --> 52:11.931
- Have another drink.
- Fucking lush, this guy.

52:11.997 --> 52:14.265
Yeah, but no one fucks
with your brothers.

52:14.332 --> 52:15.467
Understand?

52:22.742 --> 52:25.410
- Hey. Hey.
- What's up?

52:25.477 --> 52:26.812
- Hey, you burning something?
- How are you, dude?

52:26.879 --> 52:28.781
Hey.
Look who decided to show up.

52:28.848 --> 52:30.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:33.185 --> 52:35.320
Hey.

52:35.386 --> 52:37.623
Where you coming from?

52:37.690 --> 52:39.390
Just saying hi
to Uncle Carmine.

52:39.457 --> 52:41.827
No, before that.

52:41.894 --> 52:45.396
I just stopped by the bakery
quick, said hey to Tommy.

52:45.463 --> 52:49.101
Oh.
No Leo this year?

52:49.168 --> 52:51.336
Yeah, I guess not.

52:51.402 --> 52:53.471
What, you haven't
spoken to him?

52:53.538 --> 52:55.641
You guys are like two peas
in a pod.

52:55.708 --> 52:57.509
Eh...

52:57.575 --> 52:59.245
We've been celebrating
your father every year

52:59.310 --> 53:00.913
for ten years on this day.

53:00.980 --> 53:04.683
All of a sudden, he's missing,
and you ain't worried?

53:04.750 --> 53:07.285
Who said he was missing?

53:07.352 --> 53:09.155
I mean,
I-I don't know where he is,

53:09.221 --> 53:11.791
if that's
what you're asking me.

53:11.857 --> 53:14.392
Well, why don't you give him
a call, ask him to come?

53:14.459 --> 53:15.861
Want me to call him?

53:15.928 --> 53:17.763
Well, he might have forgotten
the date.

53:17.830 --> 53:19.364
Call him up.

53:19.430 --> 53:22.333
I would, but I lost
my phone tonight.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.469
When?

53:24.536 --> 53:26.337
Just earlier tonight.
A couple hours ago.

53:26.404 --> 53:27.640
Where?

53:28.941 --> 53:31.010
Well, if I knew where
I lost my phone,

53:31.076 --> 53:32.711
it wouldn't be lost, would it?

53:36.782 --> 53:38.483
Use mine.

53:38.550 --> 53:41.020
You serious?

53:41.086 --> 53:44.322
- Yeah. Call.
- Okay.

53:44.389 --> 53:46.357
- Fucking call him.
- Fine.

53:46.424 --> 53:49.394
I'll call him.

54:00.606 --> 54:03.642
<i>Please leave
your message for 64...</i>

54:03.709 --> 54:05.343
I don't know.
It went to voice mail.

54:05.410 --> 54:06.745
What a fucking piece of work,

54:06.812 --> 54:10.282
this cousin of yours,
not honoring his family.

54:10.348 --> 54:11.684
What?

54:11.750 --> 54:13.752
What?
He knows I'm fucking with him.

54:13.819 --> 54:15.486
Right, Gio?

54:15.553 --> 54:16.989
He knows I'm fucking... what?

54:17.056 --> 54:18.724
What are you
looking at him for?

54:18.791 --> 54:21.126
You know I'm fucking
with you, right?

54:21.193 --> 54:22.962
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

54:23.028 --> 54:24.630
I think he said "yeah,"
but it sounded like

54:24.697 --> 54:27.498
he was getting fingered
by his girlfriend.

54:27.565 --> 54:29.168
I'm not a kid anymore,
all right?

54:29.235 --> 54:30.803
You can't talk to me like that.

54:30.870 --> 54:32.304
What's that?

54:32.370 --> 54:34.907
Have some respect, okay?

54:39.879 --> 54:42.547
- Go fuck yourself, huh?
- Whoa.

54:46.252 --> 54:48.754
You take that?

54:48.821 --> 54:49.855
Whoa!

54:49.922 --> 54:52.258
What the fuck?

54:52.324 --> 54:53.659
What?

54:53.726 --> 54:55.526
What, like he's never
seen a gun before?

54:55.593 --> 54:57.229
You've seen a gun before,
right?

54:57.296 --> 54:59.298
No fucking guns
in this house.

54:59.365 --> 55:00.733
And that means you, too.

55:00.799 --> 55:02.201
Don't give me this
"I'm a cop" bullshit.

55:02.268 --> 55:04.036
- I'm just having a little fun.
- Oh, yeah?

55:04.103 --> 55:05.204
- Yeah.
- Fun?

55:05.271 --> 55:06.872
This looks like
a fucking nightclub to you?

55:06.939 --> 55:10.943
Huh? Anybody else bring a gun?

55:11.010 --> 55:12.577
How many times Angelo's
got to say something

55:12.645 --> 55:14.013
before you listen?

55:14.079 --> 55:16.649
Tonight's about family.
Please.

55:21.353 --> 55:23.222
All right. All right.

55:23.289 --> 55:24.455
All right.

55:26.892 --> 55:29.929
- Come on!
- Fucking maniac.

55:39.004 --> 55:40.673
Sometimes you think you lost
your phone,

55:40.739 --> 55:44.043
and it's right in your pocket
the whole fucking time.

55:44.109 --> 55:46.845
- Happens all the time.
- Are you happy now? Huh?

55:46.912 --> 55:50.215
You drunk fucking
cock-sucking cop.

55:50.282 --> 55:51.884
Don't you have someplace to be,

55:51.951 --> 55:53.819
like maybe on duty
or something?

55:53.886 --> 55:56.855
This is who we hire
to protect us.

55:56.922 --> 56:00.125
Motherfucking
crooked-cop motherfucker.

56:00.192 --> 56:01.627
Fuck him. Fuck him!

56:07.299 --> 56:08.901
Fucking ruined our night.

56:08.968 --> 56:11.904
It's fine.
Don't worry about it. Come on.

56:11.971 --> 56:13.538
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

56:18.377 --> 56:20.913
The whole fucking thing...
you only see her eyes.

56:20.980 --> 56:22.281
What do they call that?
What do they call that?

56:22.348 --> 56:23.983
It's the durka? Durka?

56:24.049 --> 56:25.417
- A burka.
- Burka or durka?

56:25.483 --> 56:26.652
It's a burka.

56:26.719 --> 56:27.920
- You fucking idiot.
- I don't know.

56:27.987 --> 56:29.355
Fuck, I don't know,
burka, durka.

56:29.421 --> 56:30.723
This guy's worldly.

56:33.926 --> 56:35.593
- All right.
- I'll see you there.

56:35.661 --> 56:36.929
You're paying, right?

56:36.996 --> 56:38.596
You know what?
I got to tell you something.

56:38.664 --> 56:40.265
I saw that broad you were
with the other night,

56:40.332 --> 56:41.967
and everybody kept asking me...
it was highly questionable.

56:42.034 --> 56:43.836
Yeah, they wanted to know
if it was a broad or not.

56:43.902 --> 56:46.537
What's up with your girls?
They all got fake asses.

56:46.605 --> 56:48.674
No, they don't.
No, they don't.

56:48.741 --> 56:51.810
- Oh, I forgot.
- Yours was questionable.

56:51.877 --> 56:55.381
Hey, Tony.
That's the kid over there.

56:55.447 --> 56:57.116
Hey. Hey, Gio.

56:57.182 --> 56:59.918
- Yeah.
- Come on over here. Sit down.

57:02.788 --> 57:05.324
How you doing?

57:05.391 --> 57:06.692
- Good.
- How's your ma.

57:06.759 --> 57:08.827
She still working
at that pharmacy?

57:08.894 --> 57:11.063
Yeah. Yeah. She's good.
She's still there.

57:11.130 --> 57:12.664
Good.

57:12.731 --> 57:16.201
You know, your father,
he was a real shark.

57:16.268 --> 57:17.535
Could never read him.

57:17.602 --> 57:19.338
No matter how sharp
you thought you was.

57:19.405 --> 57:22.573
Come on.
I'm always winning, baby.

57:22.641 --> 57:23.976
No, you ain't.

57:24.043 --> 57:27.679
You know, when I say
your pops was a shark,

57:27.746 --> 57:29.782
I ain't talking about cards.

57:33.485 --> 57:34.953
Okay.

57:35.020 --> 57:39.324
See, the difference
between you and your old man...

57:39.391 --> 57:42.227
he was good here.

57:42.294 --> 57:46.131
You, Gio, you're good here.

57:47.366 --> 57:50.369
Sometimes you only get
dealt one or the other.

57:50.436 --> 57:53.639
This or this.

57:56.041 --> 57:58.977
You got to learn
the other, Gio.

57:59.044 --> 58:01.914
Otherwise, it's gonna
get you in trouble.

58:01.980 --> 58:04.450
<i>Capisce?</i>

58:04.516 --> 58:06.552
<i>Capisce?</i>

58:06.618 --> 58:08.987
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

58:09.054 --> 58:10.789
All right.

58:10.856 --> 58:12.191
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

58:12.257 --> 58:13.826
- Hey, look who it is.
- Hey. Happy holidays.

58:13.892 --> 58:15.094
Hey, what'd they

58:15.160 --> 58:17.162
get you
some phonebooks to sit on?

58:17.229 --> 58:19.264
You're a regular
fucking Don Rickles.

58:19.331 --> 58:21.633
- Except a lot uglier.
- Hey, go in the kitchen.

58:21.700 --> 58:22.901
- Get something to eat.
- What's up, kid?

58:22.968 --> 58:24.903
- Hey.
- Enjoy the sausage, gentlemen.

58:24.970 --> 58:26.905
You remember,
you eat the sausage, okay?

58:26.972 --> 58:29.208
Who are those guys?

58:29.274 --> 58:30.742
Don't worry about them.

58:30.809 --> 58:32.611
They're nothing.
They're nobody.

58:32.678 --> 58:34.413
Hey, don't worry
about them, all right?

58:34.480 --> 58:35.981
Okay.

58:36.048 --> 58:37.749
- All right, what do we got?
- I'm taking all this money.

58:37.816 --> 58:40.319
You ain't taking shit.
Give me the cards.

58:40.385 --> 58:43.055
Let me deal it out.

58:43.122 --> 58:46.058
This guy ruined the whole hand.
Let's go.

58:46.125 --> 58:48.627
Hey, Uncle Angelo, I noticed
it's only guys tonight.

58:48.694 --> 58:49.828
Am I missing something?

58:49.895 --> 58:51.864
I thought we told you.

58:51.930 --> 58:53.932
- Told me what?
- You know, your cousin Marie,

58:53.999 --> 58:55.901
she's having that
bachelorette party tonight.

58:55.968 --> 58:59.438
So we decided
to make it a boys' night.

58:59.505 --> 59:01.039
What's the matter?

59:01.106 --> 59:02.908
Hey, Ang, he don't trust us.

59:02.975 --> 59:05.110
He don't think
we can cook or something.

59:05.177 --> 59:09.148
No. No, it's fine. Of course.
Yeah, boys' night. Hey.

59:19.491 --> 59:22.161
Talk to them.

59:22.227 --> 59:23.395
Come here.

59:25.831 --> 59:28.267
- Here, sit down.
- Okay.

59:28.333 --> 59:30.169
What's going on?

59:34.273 --> 59:36.175
Yeah. Of course.

59:43.849 --> 59:46.084
I think so.

59:56.295 --> 59:57.863
No.

59:57.930 --> 59:59.898
I've been trying
to get ahold of him.

59:59.965 --> 1:00:01.433
I can't get ahold of him.

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.769
Yeah, well, he hasn't even
called his own mother.

1:00:03.835 --> 1:00:06.104
And we're worried about him.
That's all.

1:00:06.171 --> 1:00:10.075
I mean, when was the last time
you two saw each other?

1:00:10.142 --> 1:00:12.110
I don't
know, it's been a while...

1:00:12.177 --> 1:00:13.680
I didn't ask you
how long it's been.

1:00:13.745 --> 1:00:15.113
I asked you when
you seen him last.

1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:16.748
I've been trying
to get ahold of him.

1:00:16.815 --> 1:00:18.083
I don't know.
I want to help him.

1:00:18.150 --> 1:00:19.718
- You want to help him?
- Yeah.

1:00:19.785 --> 1:00:21.987
Well, he got mixed up with
some dangerous fucking people.

1:00:22.054 --> 1:00:24.823
Look, Angelo wants
to even the debt.

1:00:24.890 --> 1:00:28.026
But Leo's got to come see us,
you understand?

1:00:28.093 --> 1:00:29.728
Yeah. Look, trust me,
if I could get ahold of him,

1:00:29.795 --> 1:00:31.063
I would tell him to be here

1:00:31.129 --> 1:00:35.133
to work it out
with you, Angelo, I would.

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.638
He must be scared. I'd be.

1:00:38.705 --> 1:00:41.373
You know, I'm just worried
that he's being bullied

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:45.010
by those cock-sucking cops,
even worse, the feds.

1:00:45.077 --> 1:00:47.714
If it's the feds,
it can be tricky,

1:00:47.779 --> 1:00:50.515
if you don't know
who you're dealing with.

1:00:50.582 --> 1:00:54.419
Have you heard
if he's been talking to them?

1:00:54.486 --> 1:00:57.322
No. No, I haven't heard
anything like that.

1:01:06.231 --> 1:01:07.599
I know.

1:01:07.667 --> 1:01:09.368
Look, if there's anything

1:01:09.434 --> 1:01:12.838
that you want to say to us,
now is the time.

1:01:12.904 --> 1:01:15.274
I promise,
your uncle won't get mad.

1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:18.110
But he can't help
unless he knows.

1:01:19.878 --> 1:01:21.346
Uh, no.

1:01:21.413 --> 1:01:23.348
No, not me.

1:01:27.152 --> 1:01:30.255
Um, I don't know.
I'm just worried about him.

1:01:30.322 --> 1:01:31.556
That's all.

1:01:43.869 --> 1:01:45.904
I'm gonna go get something
to eat.

1:01:58.183 --> 1:02:01.386
Do I know why
you have long hair? No.

1:02:05.792 --> 1:02:06.925
Yeah.

1:02:38.323 --> 1:02:40.425
I don't know. Maybe hers?

1:03:09.689 --> 1:03:12.090
<i>Before a drive-by shooting
took his voice</i>

1:03:12.157 --> 1:03:13.793
<i>and almost his life,</i>

1:03:13.860 --> 1:03:18.230
<i>Angelo had always thrown grand
parties for the neighborhood.</i>

1:03:18.296 --> 1:03:20.365
<i>Fireworks
on the Fourth of July.</i>

1:03:20.432 --> 1:03:22.901
<i>Turkey giveaways
at Thanksgiving.</i>

1:03:22.968 --> 1:03:27.172
<i>Everyone loved and
respected him, especially Gio.</i>

1:03:27.239 --> 1:03:28.608
<i>But since the shooting,</i>

1:03:28.674 --> 1:03:32.110
<i>Angelo had grown paranoid
and isolated,</i>

1:03:32.177 --> 1:03:35.147
<i>and the family's
influence had waned,</i>

1:03:35.213 --> 1:03:38.785
<i>leaving a power vacuum
in its wake...</i>

1:03:38.851 --> 1:03:40.686
<i>leaving blood in the water.</i>

1:03:40.753 --> 1:03:43.522
Bootsy. How many of those
male strippers' cocks

1:03:43.588 --> 1:03:45.190
do you think are
in your wife's mouth

1:03:45.257 --> 1:03:47.459
right now
at that bachelorette party?

1:03:47.526 --> 1:03:50.195
How many cocks do you think
she's sucking right now?

1:03:50.262 --> 1:03:51.930
Hey, give me-give me that.

1:03:51.997 --> 1:03:53.633
There you go. Eat that.

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:55.300
Yeah, get another ball
in your mouth,

1:03:55.367 --> 1:03:57.202
just like your
fucking big wife.

1:03:57.269 --> 1:03:59.004
Oh!

1:03:59.070 --> 1:04:01.239
I gave you a beating
in the backyard.

1:04:01.306 --> 1:04:03.508
I'm gonna give you
another fucking beating.

1:04:03.575 --> 1:04:05.477
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, look, I love you.

1:04:05.544 --> 1:04:06.846
- You're jealous.
- I love you.

1:04:06.913 --> 1:04:08.246
You're jealous.

1:04:08.313 --> 1:04:10.415
- You had too much to drink.
- I'm sorry.

1:04:10.482 --> 1:04:12.551
I fucking love you.
You know that.

1:04:14.986 --> 1:04:16.521
- I'm only joking.
- I know you are.

1:04:16.588 --> 1:04:17.623
All right. Okay.

1:04:17.690 --> 1:04:18.925
All right. Settle down.
Settle down.

1:04:18.990 --> 1:04:20.358
Settle down.

1:04:27.599 --> 1:04:29.902
Thanks, Angelo.

1:04:29.968 --> 1:04:32.037
I want to say a few words.

1:04:35.106 --> 1:04:38.210
Ten years ago today...

1:04:38.276 --> 1:04:41.279
we lost one
of our brothers, Gio's father.

1:04:41.346 --> 1:04:44.583
The husband to Angelo's
younger sister Sofia.

1:04:44.650 --> 1:04:49.087
A good man.
An honest man. A family man.

1:04:49.154 --> 1:04:51.858
Tonight we bury our hearts,

1:04:51.924 --> 1:04:55.628
and we break bread
to celebrate in his memory.

1:04:55.695 --> 1:05:00.565
I remember when me and Angelo
were just your age.

1:05:00.633 --> 1:05:02.033
Life back then was a little
more black and white,

1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:03.401
so to speak.

1:05:03.468 --> 1:05:07.172
No computers.
None of this cell phone shit.

1:05:07.239 --> 1:05:09.909
Our heads were up.
Our eyes were open.

1:05:09.976 --> 1:05:12.511
And like glue,
we stuck together.

1:05:12.577 --> 1:05:15.146
- Ain't that the truth?
- I guess what I'm trying

1:05:15.213 --> 1:05:18.483
to say
is family wasn't optional.

1:05:20.051 --> 1:05:21.787
Loyalty...

1:05:21.854 --> 1:05:24.422
loyalty was essential.

1:05:25.791 --> 1:05:27.727
We didn't have a choice
but to lean on each other.

1:05:31.029 --> 1:05:35.100
Family wasn't something we just
leaned on when we needed it.

1:05:35.166 --> 1:05:37.135
Our blood is the glue.

1:05:37.202 --> 1:05:40.171
It runs through
every one of us at this table.

1:05:40.238 --> 1:05:43.408
Through our veins.
Connected.

1:05:43.475 --> 1:05:46.211
But blood needs to be spilled
in order for you

1:05:46.278 --> 1:05:48.948
to see it working.

1:05:49.015 --> 1:05:51.918
And in the case...

1:05:51.984 --> 1:05:54.553
of Gio's father,

1:05:54.620 --> 1:05:58.024
sometimes we're brought
together through tragedy.

1:06:05.698 --> 1:06:08.333
You know,
sometimes I talk too much.

1:06:09.769 --> 1:06:12.638
You got something to say?
I mean, you're family.

1:06:12.705 --> 1:06:13.839
You're blood.

1:06:22.848 --> 1:06:24.215
Yeah, um...

1:06:28.219 --> 1:06:31.256
Family is loyalty.

1:06:31.323 --> 1:06:34.526
My ma, she's the one
that taught me that...

1:06:34.593 --> 1:06:36.062
from day one.

1:06:36.127 --> 1:06:38.363
But, uh...

1:06:38.430 --> 1:06:41.701
she also taught me that
sometimes to be a real man,

1:06:41.767 --> 1:06:43.869
you got to stand
on your own two feet.

1:06:47.305 --> 1:06:50.810
Not lean on anything,
just like my pops.

1:06:52.945 --> 1:06:55.447
So...

1:06:55.513 --> 1:06:58.383
I really appreciate the night,
but it's getting late.

1:06:58.450 --> 1:07:00.653
So I do go to go check on...

1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:02.153
Thank you, Angelo.

1:07:02.220 --> 1:07:03.388
Relax..

1:07:09.394 --> 1:07:11.363
Yeah. Yeah, the cake.

1:07:11.429 --> 1:07:13.365
- The cake.
- The cake.

1:07:14.667 --> 1:07:17.168
Here we are, rambling on
about our family tradition,

1:07:17.235 --> 1:07:20.472
and we're all about to blow
a ten-year family tradition,

1:07:20.538 --> 1:07:21.907
your mother's famous cake.

1:07:21.974 --> 1:07:24.110
Everybody's gonna get a piece.
No exceptions.

1:07:24.175 --> 1:07:25.911
Joey, get a knife.

1:07:28.146 --> 1:07:30.916
Hey. This is some cake here.

1:07:48.768 --> 1:07:50.368
Thanks, Uncle Ang.

1:07:54.239 --> 1:07:56.909
I'm actually allergic
to chocolate.

1:07:58.911 --> 1:08:00.278
I can't eat that.

1:08:11.356 --> 1:08:13.224
Okay. Everybody, eat. Eat.

1:08:13.291 --> 1:08:14.794
Come on.
It's past Gio's bedtime.

1:08:14.860 --> 1:08:15.861
All right. Finally.

1:08:15.928 --> 1:08:17.462
This frosting looks
all fucked up.

1:08:17.529 --> 1:08:20.198
What'd you do?
Kick it around?

1:08:20.265 --> 1:08:22.935
- Mmm, good.
- That's a good cake.

1:08:23.002 --> 1:08:25.871
Bootsy, watch your fingers.

1:08:25.938 --> 1:08:29.642
A delicious cake, Gio.
Thank you for that.

1:08:29.709 --> 1:08:31.977
You know what, Uncle Angelo?
I can... I'll just stop

1:08:32.044 --> 1:08:34.212
by tomorrow
and get the present, you know?

1:08:34.279 --> 1:08:37.315
Just a second.
He'll be right out.

1:08:37.382 --> 1:08:39.118
Don't want
to spoil the surprise.

1:08:49.829 --> 1:08:51.329
Mmm.

1:08:58.137 --> 1:08:59.404
Hey, Ang!

1:08:59.471 --> 1:09:01.173
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1:09:01.239 --> 1:09:05.177
Need a hand in there?

1:09:05.243 --> 1:09:07.146
Somebody call an ambulance?

1:09:07.213 --> 1:09:08.413
- Angelo!
- Come on. Come on.

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:09.648
Come on.
Come on. Move. Move. Move.

1:09:09.715 --> 1:09:11.316
What the fuck is going on?

1:09:11.382 --> 1:09:13.619
- What the fuck is going on?
- Angelo!

1:09:16.088 --> 1:09:19.692
Angelo! Angelo!
Angelo!

1:09:19.759 --> 1:09:22.628
I need an ambulance!
Get the fuck out of my way.

1:09:22.695 --> 1:09:25.263
Where's the fucking ambulance?
What's the address here?

1:09:25.330 --> 1:09:28.200
Angelo, what?
What?

1:09:28.266 --> 1:09:30.803
- Sofia.
- Sofia?

1:09:30.870 --> 1:09:33.973
Why is he saying "Sofia"?
What did you do?

1:09:34.039 --> 1:09:37.275
You motherfuck...

1:09:37.342 --> 1:09:38.911
Vito!

1:09:52.625 --> 1:09:55.060
Gio. What did you do?

1:11:20.411 --> 1:11:22.248
<i>Carmine. It's Ricardo.</i>

1:11:22.314 --> 1:11:25.618
<i>I keep calling Angelo,
but he ain't picking up.</i>

1:11:25.684 --> 1:11:27.987
<i>They found our little friend.</i>

1:11:28.053 --> 1:11:29.321
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

1:11:32.224 --> 1:11:33.591
<i>Hello, Carmine.</i>

1:11:42.167 --> 1:11:43.903
Fuck you.

1:11:51.710 --> 1:11:53.946
<i>Touch my robe.</i>

1:14:07.146 --> 1:14:10.783
What have I been telling you,
Leo, all your fucking life?

1:14:13.584 --> 1:14:15.687
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

1:14:18.524 --> 1:14:20.259
You disappear on me,

1:14:20.325 --> 1:14:23.328
and now I find out
you're talking to the feds?

1:14:23.395 --> 1:14:25.297
The fucking feds?

1:14:25.364 --> 1:14:26.965
Jesus!

1:14:27.032 --> 1:14:28.967
Oh!

1:14:29.034 --> 1:14:30.601
Christ!

1:14:37.743 --> 1:14:42.081
Fucking kicker of it all...

1:14:42.147 --> 1:14:44.483
is the one person
who was trying to protect you

1:14:44.550 --> 1:14:47.719
is dead 'cause of you.

1:14:47.786 --> 1:14:49.421
'Cause of you, Gio is dead.

1:14:53.425 --> 1:14:56.295
Don't fucking move.

1:14:58.897 --> 1:15:00.199
I said don't move.

1:15:00.265 --> 1:15:02.701
I heard you, Gio.
I heard you.

1:15:02.768 --> 1:15:05.304
- Just relax.
- Leo, you okay?

1:15:11.977 --> 1:15:13.979
You said you wasn't
a kid anymore.

1:15:16.682 --> 1:15:19.918
Earlier,
at your uncle Angelo's...

1:15:19.985 --> 1:15:23.655
that's what
you said to me, right?

1:15:23.722 --> 1:15:25.390
Sometimes...

1:15:29.194 --> 1:15:33.298
Us grown-ups need
to do things that...

1:15:33.365 --> 1:15:36.101
well, they're hard,
and they're confusing.

1:15:36.168 --> 1:15:39.404
You don't want to hurt anyone.
Just... just give me the gun.

1:15:41.340 --> 1:15:45.043
Just give me the gun,
and we'll talk, like adults.

1:15:47.079 --> 1:15:50.182
No one loves your cousin
more than me.

1:15:50.249 --> 1:15:52.651
But he's a rat, Gio.

1:15:52.718 --> 1:15:56.522
Why do you think he's hiding
here at this whore's house?

1:15:56.588 --> 1:15:58.190
Huh?

1:15:58.257 --> 1:16:00.926
I know you're
smarter than that.

1:16:00.993 --> 1:16:03.061
Jeopardize the entire family.

1:16:03.128 --> 1:16:04.429
No.

1:16:08.467 --> 1:16:10.035
Leo.

1:16:10.102 --> 1:16:13.405
Just hand me the gun.
I'll take you home.

1:16:14.973 --> 1:16:16.775
I'll take you home.

1:16:32.024 --> 1:16:34.793
Where the fuck is that gun?

1:16:57.482 --> 1:16:59.218
I got to give it to you.

1:17:01.553 --> 1:17:05.557
You put up a better fight
than your old man did.

1:17:30.349 --> 1:17:32.117
Leo. Leo. Leo.

1:17:32.184 --> 1:17:33.218
Hey, hey.

1:17:33.285 --> 1:17:35.787
You okay? Hey. Hey.
Where are you hurt?

1:17:35.854 --> 1:17:39.124
- Gio. Gio.
- Hey. Shh.

1:17:39.191 --> 1:17:40.826
Leo!

1:17:43.295 --> 1:17:46.832
Shh. Shh. Shh. Be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

1:17:46.898 --> 1:17:49.468
Leo. Shut up. Leo. Shh.
Stop. Stop.

1:17:49.534 --> 1:17:51.837
Leo, you're gonna be okay.
Don't fucking die.

1:17:51.903 --> 1:17:53.272
Leo, don't fucking die.

1:17:53.338 --> 1:17:56.008
Leo. Leo.

1:17:57.776 --> 1:17:59.578
Leo, don't fucking die!

1:17:59.646 --> 1:18:01.146
Leo!

1:18:01.213 --> 1:18:04.249
Leo!

1:18:04.316 --> 1:18:05.817
No, Leo.

1:18:09.421 --> 1:18:11.823
Somebody help me!

1:18:11.890 --> 1:18:13.358
Leo! Fuck!

1:18:55.702 --> 1:18:57.770
<i>At Sofia's request,</i>

1:18:57.836 --> 1:19:01.239
<i>I read this verse for Gio
at his father's funeral.</i>

1:19:03.141 --> 1:19:05.577
<i>"When you pass
through the waters,</i>

1:19:05.645 --> 1:19:08.447
<i>"I will be with you.</i>

1:19:08.513 --> 1:19:10.949
<i>"And when you pass
through the rivers,</i>

1:19:11.016 --> 1:19:14.620
<i>"they will not sweep over you.</i>

1:19:14.687 --> 1:19:19.191
<i>"When you walk through the
fire, you will not be burned.</i>

1:19:19.257 --> 1:19:21.927
<i>The flames will not
set you ablaze."</i>

1:19:23.763 --> 1:19:27.432
<i>"Others were given
in exchange for you.</i>

1:19:27.499 --> 1:19:30.335
<i>"I traded their lives
for yours,</i>

1:19:30.402 --> 1:19:32.772
<i>because you are
precious to me."</i>

1:19:36.041 --> 1:19:37.876
<i>For ten years,</i>

1:19:37.943 --> 1:19:41.246
<i>Gio carried
that cake for his father</i>

1:19:41.313 --> 1:19:44.349
<i>while his mother waited
for him to become a man.</i>

1:20:42.073 --> 1:20:43.876
Gio! Gio! It's me!

1:20:43.942 --> 1:20:46.244
Gio. Gio. It's okay.

1:20:46.311 --> 1:20:50.817
My son.
My child. Are you hurt?

1:20:50.883 --> 1:20:53.285
Father.

1:20:53.351 --> 1:20:55.987
Father.

1:20:56.054 --> 1:20:58.925
My son.

1:20:58.990 --> 1:21:02.594
Father, everybody's dead.

1:21:02.662 --> 1:21:05.765
- Leo, he's dead.
- Oh, my boy. My boy.

1:21:05.832 --> 1:21:08.533
It's okay. It's okay to cry.

1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:10.168
It's okay, my son.

1:21:10.235 --> 1:21:14.674
My son. you must listen to me.
Listen. Listen.

1:21:14.740 --> 1:21:17.175
I knew you were coming.
I knew you were coming.

1:21:17.242 --> 1:21:18.977
I've been waiting for you.
I've been praying.

1:21:19.044 --> 1:21:21.881
What are you talking about?

1:21:21.948 --> 1:21:25.517
I know what's happened.

1:21:25.584 --> 1:21:27.552
Trust me.

1:21:33.258 --> 1:21:35.393
Thank you, Gio.

1:21:36.662 --> 1:21:41.233
- What?
- Thank you for painting.

1:21:41.299 --> 1:21:43.435
Thank you for all the painting

1:21:43.502 --> 1:21:47.239
you've done in the church
all night long.

1:21:48.741 --> 1:21:52.244
Why are you
covering for me, Father?

1:21:56.348 --> 1:21:58.818
That's my burden to bear.

1:21:58.885 --> 1:22:00.653
It's time.

1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.690
It's time for you
to learn the truth.

1:22:04.757 --> 1:22:07.092
The truth?

1:22:07.158 --> 1:22:09.762
What's the truth, Father?

1:22:18.838 --> 1:22:20.806
My boy.

1:22:23.208 --> 1:22:27.512
My boy.
It's okay.

1:22:27.579 --> 1:22:29.548
You're safe now.

1:22:34.319 --> 1:22:37.723
Let me see you.

1:22:37.790 --> 1:22:40.091
Ma, the cake.

1:22:40.158 --> 1:22:42.594
Shh.

1:22:42.662 --> 1:22:44.997
No, Gio.

1:22:45.063 --> 1:22:47.265
Shh.

1:22:56.408 --> 1:22:58.878
Thank you, Father, for my boy.

1:23:02.213 --> 1:23:05.183
I think we should go, now.
Please.

1:23:05.250 --> 1:23:09.021
Okay, you ready? Come on.

1:23:09.087 --> 1:23:11.657
- Please.
- Come on.

1:23:13.025 --> 1:23:14.660
W-wait.

1:23:17.228 --> 1:23:19.130
- Wait...
- Gio.

1:24:07.113 --> 1:24:09.048
Happy birthday, Pop.
