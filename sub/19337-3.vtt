WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.570
<i> Previously on</i> Reign:
I can't do it, I don't want it.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.704
You don't want what?

00:05.706 --> 00:08.073
To be king.

00:08.075 --> 00:10.175
Charles is shirking
every responsibility imaginable.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.111
The nobles lack
leadership,

00:12.113 --> 00:13.278
especially with
the Lord Chancellor

00:13.280 --> 00:14.747
stuck in English prison.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.315
Charles can't even
be bothered to find

00:16.317 --> 00:18.183
a proper husband
for poor Claude.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.718
I'm still in mourning.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.286
We know, Claude.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.222
And frankly,
it's embarrassing.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.724
Keira, where's my son?
Where's Darnley?

00:25.726 --> 00:28.260
I don't know why you two
continue to pursue

00:28.262 --> 00:30.229
this dangerous
little love affair.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.165
I have defied Elizabeth
to secure a crown for my son,

00:33.167 --> 00:35.100
and nothing is going
to stand in my way.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.069
Certainly not you.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.570
I'm in love with a woman
I can't have.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.539
She is promised to a suitor
of a powerful family.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.207
You can break
their engagement.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.243
There's a boat ready
to take

00:44.245 --> 00:46.178
you and Lady Lola's child
back to France.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.247
I need you to befriend
Emily Knox.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.182
You don't seriously
expect me to seduce

00:50.184 --> 00:51.383
John Knox's wife?

00:51.385 --> 00:52.751
She has access
to his documents,

00:52.753 --> 00:54.219
and could be
a valuable resource.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.654
Come back to me, Gideon.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.656
Promise me you'll try
and find a way.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.362
Obviously, you could argue
that emotion blinds one

01:03.364 --> 01:04.530
to any negativity.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.231
I understand your
love for Denmark.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.167
I love Scotland
the same way.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.236
Uh, it was<i> only</i> Scotland
I was referring to.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.638
Thank you so much
for traveling

01:12.640 --> 01:14.239
all this way,
Prince Magnus.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.541
Delighted to do it.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.376
Though the channel
into your port

01:17.378 --> 01:18.644
is not nearly
as safe or calm as--

01:18.646 --> 01:20.546
As Denmark.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.581
Perhaps one day I'll
se it with my own eyes.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.416
Good-bye.

01:25.820 --> 01:30.189
So you and I,
together in this moment...

01:30.191 --> 01:32.357
God's will. Yes.

01:32.359 --> 01:35.127
That I should help you
understand the Scriptures.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.329
Of course, the better
authority on the topic

01:37.331 --> 01:39.364
is my husband.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.266
MARY:
Mrs. Knox.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.502
James.

01:44.839 --> 01:49.541
So... how goes the
courting of Mrs. Knox?

01:49.543 --> 01:52.511
Well, I suppose
I'm making progress.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.746
But I can't say I'm enjoying
deceiving someone

01:54.748 --> 01:57.116
so innocent and kind.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.251
The closer you get to her,
the closer you get

01:59.253 --> 02:00.619
to her husband's secrets...

02:00.621 --> 02:02.287
his plans against me.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.589
His alliances.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.390
I didn't enjoy
spending my time

02:05.392 --> 02:07.459
with a pompous
Danish bore,

02:07.461 --> 02:09.394
but deception is all part
of a day's work.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.662
You are hoping
that the news

02:10.664 --> 02:12.331
you are entertaining
other suitors will

02:12.333 --> 02:13.799
light a fire under
Lord Darnley.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.801
James, no one else has

02:15.803 --> 02:17.536
such a strong claim
to the English throne.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.506
Together, married,
promising an heir,

02:20.508 --> 02:23.475
we pose a real threat to
Elizabeth's right to rule.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.844
Surely, Darnley
realizes the same.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.513
Do you think he's hesitant

02:27.515 --> 02:29.181
to antagonize his queen?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.782
His family is powerful.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.485
Elizabeth can't stop him
from taking a trip north.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.555
So why isn't he here yet?

02:36.557 --> 02:39.258
What's keeping him
in England?

02:39.260 --> 02:42.261
♪ ♪

02:42.263 --> 02:44.830
DARNLEY: I'm in love, Mother,
(horses snort)

02:44.832 --> 02:46.398
in a way I know
you can't comprehend,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.367
or you would
understand.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.535
I'm going to
marry Keira,

02:49.537 --> 02:51.703
and no one else,
not even a queen.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.339
You talk as if this girl
is your savior.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.341
She is!

02:56.343 --> 02:57.910
If I lose her, I will
live a life of misery.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.512
And with her, you might
live a life of regret.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.781
Where you wake up
a year or ten from now

03:02.783 --> 03:05.717
and realize, "I could
have been a king."

03:05.719 --> 03:08.187
There's no guarantee
of that.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.656
But if I hesitate,
Keira will wed another.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.958
Mary's letters are
very expressive.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.493
You are her choice.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.763
Then why does she also
entertain royal suitors?

03:17.765 --> 03:20.532
Because she needs to know
that you are interested.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.901
But she can't
wait forever.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.537
All I ask is that
you meet her.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.206
DRIVER: Whoa!
Go on, now.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.474
Give her that Darnley charm.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.576
This is your mother's doing!

03:30.578 --> 03:32.444
It is. She's waiting
in the carriage.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.845
We don't have
much time.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.480
Before Mary
weds another?

03:35.482 --> 03:37.316
Let her do it.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.384
Before my family tires
of what they consider

03:39.386 --> 03:40.619
a lack of ambition,
bordering on madness,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.521
and cuts my purse strings!

03:42.523 --> 03:44.590
You fear your family?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.325
What about mine?
They don't trust you.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.327
They want me wed
to Lord White.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.229
You said Elizabeth
would handle that.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.496
Why hasn't he
been paid off?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.365
I can't press
the Queen of England

03:53.367 --> 03:55.117
about her finances.

03:55.118 --> 03:56.868
It's enough to know
that she doesn't want me

03:56.870 --> 03:58.403
marrying her rival.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.240
We will be together.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.941
Man and wife.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.876
Forever, I promise.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.446
And not just because
we have our queen

04:07.448 --> 04:08.947
pushing for our union,
but because

04:08.949 --> 04:10.515
I can't live without you.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.919
What is this?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.555
the day I shall return
and the time we shall meet

04:16.557 --> 04:17.956
at Blackfriar's Bridge.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.026
I wrote it down so you can
hold it in your hand

04:21.028 --> 04:23.328
until I can place
a ring on it.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.464
I am yours.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.599
For my mother, and for
Mary, Queen of Scots,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.735
this trip is an exercise
in futility.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.037
But it is a journey
I must take.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.480
They're here.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.349
Thank God.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.656
(sighs)
How he's grown.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.826
If only Francis
could see him.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.831
John.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.733
Yes, sweet John.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.437
Stephan, thank you for
returning him to me safely.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.439
I'm sorry
for your loss.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.508
Thank you.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.643
I'm afraid the child is
quite hungry.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.713
Maybe we could find
something delicious to eat.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.048
And then I'm going to
come and join you in a bit.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.916
And I've got a gift
for you as well.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.351
(John mutters)

05:20.454 --> 05:22.521
Off you go.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.823
Good boy.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.629
I'm glad to see
you've bonded.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.997
The child's an orphan.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.766
For a time, helpless
in the world.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.768
But now that he is
under your protection--

05:36.770 --> 05:38.904
I will protect him,
I swear.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.007
To honor Francis.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.776
And to honor Lola,
your poor wife.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.912
But you are his
stepfather, Stephan.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.014
I promise that you will
always be in his life.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.684
No. I don't want that.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.590
He has Lola's eyes and...

05:58.592 --> 06:01.927
and I cannot bear
to look at him.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.529
That will change in time.
Please!

06:05.966 --> 06:07.132
All right, then
get yourself settled,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.367
but I must talk to you.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.035
There's something
you should know.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.702
Does it have anything
to do with your silence

06:11.705 --> 06:12.804
in response
to requests

06:12.806 --> 06:14.039
for you to negotiate
my release?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.707
It does.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.710
I tried, I did,
but King Charles...

06:18.712 --> 06:20.011
he was unavailable,

06:20.013 --> 06:21.813
and I had to turn
to Spain for help.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.016
And in exchange,
they have pressed

06:25.018 --> 06:26.818
to replace you as
Lord Chancellor of France

06:26.820 --> 06:27.986
with one of their own.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.590
They?
My daughter, Leeza.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.726
She's back,
lording over us.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.397
A mouthpiece for her husband,
King Philip of Spain.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.833
Who, by all accounts, is
inexplicably besotted with her.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.603
The point being...

06:44.605 --> 06:46.605
Spain is trying to
insert themselves

06:46.607 --> 06:47.739
into French affairs.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.908
A Spanish
Lord Chancellor?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.043
They may as well
put themselves on the throne.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.045
Their ultimate
goal, I believe.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.581
Stephan, I know you have
been through a great deal,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.618
but I need you
in fighting form

06:59.620 --> 07:00.719
and on my side.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.588
Oh, I'm ready for a fight.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.891
I can assure you of that.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.660
ELIZABETH:<i> Bandits, they say. </i>
GIDEON:<i> I heard.</i>

07:08.662 --> 07:11.730
What are the odds
that the money I sent

07:11.732 --> 07:14.699
to pay off Darnley's
lover's fiancé

07:14.701 --> 07:16.468
just happened
to disappear?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.503
Thievery is not uncommon.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.605
Oh, do shut up,
Lord Blackburn.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.174
This only helps Mary.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.942
As long as that
little sop, Keira,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.012
is spoken for, Darnley
remains eligible.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.181
My spies tell me
that Darnley

07:29.183 --> 07:31.483
and his serpent
of a mother

07:31.485 --> 07:33.185
are already on their
way to Scotland.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.487
If Mary weds Darnley,

07:35.489 --> 07:38.490
she provides for Scotland
and England a king!

07:38.492 --> 07:40.826
(sighs)
A descendant
of her inarguably

07:40.828 --> 07:42.928
royal bloodline.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.664
Shall we bemoan
the circumstances of your birth,

07:45.666 --> 07:47.833
and the fact that our nations
are still half-Catholic,

07:47.835 --> 07:49.501
or can we move on
to a solution

07:49.503 --> 07:50.669
to the Darnley problem?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.870
One that will give you
all the power,

07:51.872 --> 07:53.672
remove Mary as a threat,

07:53.674 --> 07:55.507
and bring peace
to both our nations.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.209
What's this?

07:57.211 --> 07:59.478
Are you so hurt by Mary's
courting of Darnley

07:59.480 --> 08:00.512
that you've
forsaken her?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.814
No.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.549
No, I'd like
to marry her.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.653
With your blessing.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.021
With my blessing?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.123
What of her blessing?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.259
Think about it,
Elizabeth.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.828
She's not like you,
or even Catherine.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.763
She never angled for this job.

08:18.765 --> 08:22.067
She was crowned
at six days old,

08:22.069 --> 08:24.035
and it has cost her
everything.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.738
Francis,
whom she adored,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.840
and her best friend,
Lola.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.210
Look, I don't say this
last to lay blame,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.813
but even Mary knows
that those closest to her

08:34.815 --> 08:36.748
are forever in danger
so long as

08:36.750 --> 08:37.983
she herself is a target.

08:37.985 --> 08:41.119
She will always
be a target.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.788
Not if she willingly
stepped off her throne.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.824
Married a commoner,
moved to England,

08:45.826 --> 08:47.125
and receded from view.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.761
If you were to
welcome her here,

08:49.763 --> 08:50.829
present a unified front...

08:50.831 --> 08:53.598
And ultimately
unified nations.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.833
The longer Mary's
away from power...

08:54.835 --> 08:57.002
The harder it will be
for anyone

08:57.004 --> 09:00.105
to see her as queen
of anything.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.806
But, Gideon,
do you really think

09:01.808 --> 09:02.908
she would do this?

09:02.910 --> 09:06.311
She should, because
I love her.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.313
It's the right
thing to do.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.081
Her last chance
at happiness

09:10.083 --> 09:11.850
and, perhaps, survival.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.785
And because
I know you,

09:13.787 --> 09:15.220
and I know that
John Knox's visit

09:15.222 --> 09:17.222
and the forces against you
he exposed

09:17.224 --> 09:19.024
frightened you.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.859
And because you are very
dangerous when you're scared.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.027
And because
marrying Darnley

09:22.029 --> 09:24.262
would be tantamount
to declaring war.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.064
Be sure to
mention that as well.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.634
And pray she accepts,
for all our sakes.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.944
Ah, dear daughter,

09:38.946 --> 09:41.846
may I present
Stephan Narcisse,

09:41.848 --> 09:44.316
Lord Chancellor
of France.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.785
Lord Narcisse,
welcome home.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.120
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.355
I know what you've
been through,

09:50.357 --> 09:52.691
and I assure you
I worked tirelessly

09:52.693 --> 09:54.659
to secure your release.

09:54.661 --> 09:58.630
But, Leeza, Narcisse
secured his own release.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.834
I'm sorry,
we haven't met.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.171
Oh, did I not introduce
Cardinal Rosales.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.206
Adored by the
Vatican, put forth

10:08.208 --> 10:10.809
by the king of Spain
to fill the vacated post

10:10.811 --> 10:12.177
of Lord Chancellor of France.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.678
The position

10:13.680 --> 10:15.146
is no longer vacated.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.015
A deal is a deal.
My mother can explain the terms.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.050
I did what you asked,
Mother,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.151
I wrote to Elizabeth,

10:20.153 --> 10:21.720
and in exchange...

10:21.722 --> 10:23.688
There was no exchange.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.291
King Charles, himself,
signed a letter

10:26.293 --> 10:29.160
proposing a trade,
but Narcisse

10:29.162 --> 10:30.328
had already been
allowed to leave.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.329
Charles, where
are you going?

10:31.331 --> 10:32.664
We are speaking about

10:32.666 --> 10:34.299
the most powerful position

10:34.301 --> 10:35.900
in France.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.202
Do something.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.803
I'll take it under advisement.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.171
CATHERINE:
You'll take what
under advisement?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.073
What, you're just gonna
mouth kingly words?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.242
He doesn't seem too keen
on ruling

10:44.244 --> 10:45.410
these days, does he?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.879
Poor France,
so in need

10:47.881 --> 10:49.881
of a firm hand.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.084
A lord chancellor who
is not only pure of heart,

10:53.086 --> 10:54.786
but whose reach is long.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.854
To clasp hands
with those who

10:55.856 --> 10:57.689
truly shape
France's destiny.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.757
You're going to
mention the Pope.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.924
The Pope,
and your strongest

10:59.926 --> 11:01.960
Catholic ally,
your neighbor...

11:01.962 --> 11:03.161
Spain.
Spain.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.130
I've written to my
husband, who in turn

11:05.132 --> 11:06.998
has corresponded
with the Vatican.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.933
His Holiness wants
the Valois dynasty

11:08.935 --> 11:09.934
ruling France,

11:09.936 --> 11:11.236
so long as they promote

11:11.238 --> 11:12.804
the Catholic cause.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.106
Who better to do that
than a man of the cloth?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.841
I am honored,
Your Majesty.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.444
Though I will miss
the dry air of Spain

11:19.446 --> 11:22.147
and the expertise
of its superior physicians.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.982
My gout is near crippling

11:23.984 --> 11:26.818
and the French experts
can do nothing about it.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.255
Do you need help drafting
your letter of resignation?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.923
No.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.992
Thank you, Your Majesty.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.166
(whispering):
How do we compete?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.901
She threatens
to remove my sons,

11:42.903 --> 11:45.036
the Valois line,
from the throne.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.471
We don't take
on the competition,

11:46.473 --> 11:47.939
we eliminate it.

11:47.941 --> 11:51.009
Cardinal Rosales must go.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.944
Not here.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.380
What exactly is Leeza's grudge
against you?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.348
That I was
a terrible mother.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.784
I mean,
all my children say that,

11:59.786 --> 12:01.886
in Leeza's case
she's right.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.054
And I can't exactly

12:03.056 --> 12:04.723
make it up to her,

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
now that she threatens
my nation,

12:06.226 --> 12:07.726
and Charles...

12:07.728 --> 12:10.929
he is gutted by tragedy.
What tragedy?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.897
Oh, some friend of his
was roasted alive.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.033
And Claude...

12:15.035 --> 12:17.936
oh, Claude, poor Claude.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.838
She's praying and crying,

12:19.840 --> 12:20.972
day and night.
Over what?

12:20.974 --> 12:21.973
Leith.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.074
He was killed in the battle

12:23.076 --> 12:24.476
against the Red Knights.

12:24.478 --> 12:29.080
Stephan, I have so missed
your support.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.951
Claude needs to mourn,
but a king must be king.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.753
This friend of his,
it's not the first to die

12:34.755 --> 12:35.820
under Charles' rule.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.322
Though, the
pressures on him

12:37.324 --> 12:38.990
have been enormous
from the outset,

12:38.992 --> 12:40.225
and for one so young.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.093
Well, we can't
fix his age.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.829
But we can
acknowledge it.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.900
We need to engage him
in the pleasures of being king.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.835
Pride of a battle won
will come later,

12:50.837 --> 12:53.772
but for now a more
immediate reward may do.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.073
I don't like
where this is going.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.407
You don't like it because
you're his mother.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.976
To you, he is
still a boy.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.411
Yes.
But Charles has
desires, Catherine.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.847
And as king, he can sate them

13:02.849 --> 13:05.083
in ways most young men
only dream of.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.887
Let him have some fun;
lift his spirits,

13:08.889 --> 13:11.856
and then you can talk to him
about getting back in the game.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.058
(sighs)
Well, I suppose it can't hurt.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.394
But she has to be a nice
girl from a good family.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.396
And a willing participant.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.232
Of course.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.901
But what about
Cardinal Rosales?

13:22.903 --> 13:26.538
You're right, we can't
kill him, your daughter

13:26.540 --> 13:27.906
would suspect
us immediately

13:27.908 --> 13:29.874
and rain down
Spanish hell.

13:29.876 --> 13:33.878
I might have
a nonlethal solution.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.248
Cardinal Rosales's gout
is about to flare

13:37.250 --> 13:40.418
in a most
excruciating way.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.087
GREER:
Good hunt, Mary.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.889
(Mary chuckles)

13:55.368 --> 13:56.968
In one breath,
you ask me to marry you

13:56.970 --> 13:59.070
and give up my throne?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.272
I know it seems
a radical solution

14:01.274 --> 14:03.141
to a specific problem.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.509
The fact that you
marrying Darnley

14:04.511 --> 14:06.845
threatens her rule,
isn't the real issue.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.480
It's that you both have
claims to the one throne.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.449
Now, if we wed
and you abdicate,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.451
Elizabeth vows
she will never marry.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.853
And she will name,
as her heir,

14:14.855 --> 14:16.054
our firstborn son.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.056
Well, by naming an heir,

14:18.058 --> 14:19.991
she quiets her own nobles,

14:19.993 --> 14:22.026
who criticize her for not
providing them with a successor.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.294
Yes.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.863
But you must be perceived

14:24.865 --> 14:26.030
as blending into her rule,

14:26.032 --> 14:27.332
her society.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.300
Receding as any sort
of power player

14:29.302 --> 14:30.568
from the world's view.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.072
We would take up
residence in England.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.574
She would grant us lands
in Kent,

14:36.576 --> 14:40.311
Sandown Castle, a... a sprawling
estate with views of the sea,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.647
and as well as a
generous yearly stipend.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.949
Because I would no
longer have an income

14:44.951 --> 14:46.050
or any power.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.518
No longer a queen,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.554
merely the mother
of the next king.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.657
If you did this...

14:52.659 --> 14:54.259
supposedly for love,

14:54.261 --> 14:56.227
in time, people
would accept it.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.996
It would be for love, Gideon.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.031
But how can
I put my own

15:00.033 --> 15:02.133
happiness before
my people's welfare?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.002
This would bring them peace.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.504
James would be regent,
until our child came of age,

15:06.506 --> 15:09.941
uniting both nations
without bloodshed or war.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.110
Look, Mary,
I understand the enormity

15:12.112 --> 15:15.446
of what I'm asking, but this
is a rare moment in time.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.982
Elizabeth knows you weren't
behind the attempt on her life;

15:17.984 --> 15:20.318
she is... she's kindly
disposed to you.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.054
But she sees a union
between you and Darnley

15:23.056 --> 15:24.589
for what it is:
an act of aggression

15:24.591 --> 15:25.690
toward her crown.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.158
You don't have to win

15:27.160 --> 15:29.093
or die to end this conflict

15:29.095 --> 15:31.596
between you;
a conflict that exists

15:31.598 --> 15:33.431
merely because you were born
of the same bloodline.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.135
I am asking you to marry me.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.239
I am begging you to save
your own life.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.615
You've heard
of Diane de Poitiers?

15:50.617 --> 15:54.519
Mistresses of the king can
be very esteemed, Bianca.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.021
And should your
relationship progress,

15:57.023 --> 15:59.657
which is as much your
choice as the king's,

15:59.659 --> 16:02.093
then there is no reason why
you shouldn't marry well.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.495
Charles can help you find
an excellent match.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.665
Will he be able to help me...
tonight?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.535
Surely, you've had some
experience with men.

16:10.537 --> 16:11.970
Boys.

16:11.972 --> 16:15.273
A bit.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.476
But if I'm to give myself to the
king, I want him to enjoy it,

16:18.478 --> 16:20.712
so that I can be
his mistress.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.314
Well, here's a simple rule
for success.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.652
If it pleases the king,
don't stop.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.990
If it pleases the king...

16:31.992 --> 16:34.659
Good.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.299
Shall I come closer?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.101
Do as you like.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.438
It's you I want to please.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.107
Didn't they tell
you I'd be here?

16:49.109 --> 16:50.675
I think someone said
something about a girl.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.710
I can't remember.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.379
I barely listen
to people anymore.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.646
Would you like me to leave?
What I would like

16:55.648 --> 16:58.182
is to be born
into another family.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.650
To be powerless.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.019
You've no idea what it's like.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.620
You could tell me.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.355
Did they ask you to do that?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.556
To listen to me?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.291
A task foisted
on a stranger

17:07.293 --> 17:08.760
because no one wants to hear it,

17:08.762 --> 17:09.761
not really.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.396
I would...

17:11.398 --> 17:12.397
if it pleases you.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.099
If it pleases me.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.802
Well, I can't say
these thoughts do, but...

17:19.672 --> 17:22.640
Francis tried to warn me,
you know.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.776
Warn you... about what?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.783
Being king.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.484
Before I ever was,

17:33.486 --> 17:36.454
he gave me a test
that drowned hundreds of men.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.289
And this was
a test I passed,

17:38.291 --> 17:39.791
'cause if
I'd chosen differently,

17:39.793 --> 17:41.793
even more would have died.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.428
I still see them.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.329
I force myself to see them,

17:45.331 --> 17:46.764
bloated and rotting.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.700
Their eyes cloudy,
or fish-eaten, or worse.

17:49.702 --> 17:53.304
Still alive,
staring into the night,

17:53.306 --> 17:55.706
feeling their limbs
go slack from the cold,

17:55.708 --> 17:59.710
or the blinding pain
of a shark's bite,

17:59.712 --> 18:04.682
dragged under,
lungs bursting and then...

18:04.684 --> 18:07.552
nothing.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.520
But I can't let myself

18:09.522 --> 18:13.724
feel nothing or more will die,

18:13.726 --> 18:15.827
don't you see?

18:15.829 --> 18:18.463
I must be aware.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.499
Aware...

18:21.501 --> 18:23.201
aware...

18:23.203 --> 18:24.435
always aware.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.805
I keep this

18:27.807 --> 18:29.440
to remind me.
Here.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.547
What is this?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.282
A finger bone...

18:38.284 --> 18:40.318
from a man who died
because of me.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.887
Come with me now,

18:42.889 --> 18:45.189
so I can prove to you

18:45.191 --> 18:47.859
that I understand the pain
I inflict.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.827
And then you will
understand pain, too.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.429
Come now.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.532
It would please the king
very much.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.371
Complaining, you say?

19:00.373 --> 19:02.807
As a man in terrible
pain would.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.376
Cardinal Rosales
loathes this court,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.811
the French physicians...

19:06.813 --> 19:10.681
No one can treat a gout
now inflamed by poison.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.183
Let him go back to Spain

19:12.185 --> 19:14.819
and see what his<i> superior</i>
physicians can do.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.288
The servants are saying
he's demanding just that,

19:17.290 --> 19:18.823
an immediate departure.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.224
(sighs happily)

19:20.226 --> 19:22.460
So much for his bid
for lord chancellor.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.828
MAN:
Cardinal, please!

19:23.830 --> 19:25.163
You should be in your bed
until we can determine

19:25.165 --> 19:26.464
the cause of your blindness.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.698
(dishes clattering)

19:27.700 --> 19:29.167
ROSALES:
Lord, save me!

19:29.169 --> 19:30.801
(whispering):
Blind?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.303
How did he go blind?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.771
What did you do wrong?

19:33.773 --> 19:35.640
Nothing, I swear.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.508
I used the blue vial
you gave me and dropped it

19:37.510 --> 19:38.876
into his wine.
Did you stir it?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.546
Well, it was gone in an instant.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.847
Did you say to stir it?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.682
I did.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.684
The powder likely sunk
to the bottom of the glass.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.854
The amount one
imbibes matters

19:49.856 --> 19:53.224
or you get very strange
outcomes, I told you that.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.725
This way.
The poison was meant

19:54.727 --> 19:56.827
to worsen existing problems.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.897
People, especially people
I want to get rid of,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.365
they don't suddenly
go blind.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.833
It looks very suspicious.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.969
ROSALES:
My cane! Pick up my cane!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.406
(bird calling)

20:08.408 --> 20:10.374
MARY:
Gideon, where are we going?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.810
And don't say,
"We're almost there" again.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.613
I won't,
because we're here.

I wish it was that simple.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.771

(footsteps approaching)

21:19.979 --> 21:21.045
What is going on?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.314
These are my private chambers.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.683
Where you store your poisons?
I found them, Mother.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.952
Are you sick? Dying?
(grunts)

21:27.954 --> 21:29.854
Oh, it's awful
and smells so sweet.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.055
Because it's perfume.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.556
These are my scents.

21:32.558 --> 21:33.924
I keep them locked up

21:33.926 --> 21:35.493
because they are very,
very expensive.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.363
What is going on?

21:39.365 --> 21:40.965
I will test each and every one,
I swear,

21:40.967 --> 21:42.566
and people will die.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.035
Or before I run out of
innocent servants,

21:44.037 --> 21:46.037
you can tell me what you did
to Cardinal Rosales.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.571
What are you talking about?

21:47.573 --> 21:49.540
You poisoned him
and he is blind.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.775
Did you mean to kill him?

21:50.777 --> 21:52.510
Did you think I wouldn't know?

21:52.512 --> 21:54.412
And you have
accomplished nothing.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.080
Rosales is staying at court.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.382
He will be Lord Chancellor.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.551
I have already sent for
a reader to assist him.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.621
Having a disability doesn't
disqualify a skilled applicant,

22:03.623 --> 22:05.690
not in Spain, and not here.

22:05.692 --> 22:09.660
Yes, Spain is known for
it's equality and compassion.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.962
The Inquisition
taught everyone that.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.931
It could teach you as well.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.500
I'll catch you at
something yet, Mother.

22:16.502 --> 22:20.571
And I will destroy you
for daring to take me on.

22:27.347 --> 22:31.615
And grant eternal rest
to Leith Bayard,

22:31.617 --> 22:35.653
(voice breaking):
my love, your servant.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.823
My sight serves your will,
oh, Lord.

22:38.825 --> 22:42.927
My eyes do not covet,
do not lust.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.796
They await your divine intimacy.

22:45.798 --> 22:50.101
And also, Lord, I pray
for my own earthly peace,

22:50.103 --> 22:52.703
that I might...
(yells)
The flames, I burn!

22:52.705 --> 22:54.672
(whimpering)

22:54.674 --> 22:56.707
Take my hand, Cardinal.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.743
You're going to be fine.

22:58.745 --> 22:59.810
Here.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.546
Sit.
(panting)

23:02.548 --> 23:04.014
Thank you, my child.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.018
Oh...

23:08.020 --> 23:11.122
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.928
S-should I call for someone?

23:20.733 --> 23:23.834
Cardinal Rosales,
a-are you all right?

23:25.972 --> 23:28.105
<i> Jesus Christo.</i>

23:28.107 --> 23:30.741
<i> She is a miracle worker.</i>

23:30.743 --> 23:33.744
Claude?
A miracle worker?

23:33.746 --> 23:34.979
Just as I had begun to doubt,

23:34.981 --> 23:36.414
God sent blessed Claude

23:36.416 --> 23:38.115
to restore my sight.

23:38.117 --> 23:41.652
Her tears have touched
this most sacred relic

23:41.654 --> 23:43.821
and vanquished my darkness.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.490
Your sister is God's messenger.

23:46.492 --> 23:47.725
My sister?

23:47.727 --> 23:50.094
Who is bedding the help?

23:50.096 --> 23:53.063
She has the makings of a saint.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.934
Mary Magdalene sinned, too.
Yes.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.602
I admit, this is strange,

23:58.604 --> 23:59.837
but how dare you attack me?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.105
Attack Leith.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.973
Are you working
with Mother on this?

24:02.975 --> 24:05.142
Are you that desperate
for her love?

24:05.144 --> 24:06.777
(chuckling):
Me?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.746
What about you?

24:08.748 --> 24:10.748
Storming in here
and punishing us

24:10.750 --> 24:13.184
because no one cared about you.
And they didn't.

24:13.186 --> 24:15.719
You were so dreary and dull,
that once you were gone,

24:15.721 --> 24:17.855
they never even spoke of you!

24:17.857 --> 24:19.156
You were forgotten completely!

24:19.158 --> 24:22.793
The passion of the divine.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.529
And to think, that you had
delivered Claude's sacred light

24:25.531 --> 24:28.599
from your most blessed womb.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.701
NARCISSE: Cardinal, please,
I think you may be...
(whispering): Yes!

24:30.703 --> 24:32.736
Oh, my daughter.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.905
She's a saint.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.074
Claude's piety,

24:37.076 --> 24:38.542
it always set her apart

24:38.544 --> 24:40.744
from my other children.
Hmm.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.179
(under her breathe):
This could work for us.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.181
(sighs)

24:44.183 --> 24:46.550
JAMES:
<i> Elizabeth?</i>

24:46.552 --> 24:48.953
Queen of both nations?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.721
In name only.
You would rule Scotland,

24:50.723 --> 24:52.189
as you did in Mary's absence.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.024
Under Elizabeth?
Yes.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.860
And you negotiated
with her successfully,

24:55.862 --> 24:58.662
pleasantly enough, in the past,
you are Protestant...

24:58.664 --> 25:01.799
And no threat to her crown,
as my mother was too lowborn.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.868
What is to prevent Elizabeth
from removing James from power

25:03.870 --> 25:05.736
after I abdicate?

25:05.738 --> 25:07.271
Scotland itself
will protect him.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.006
Its people have never,
and will never,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.808
accept foreign rule.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.543
And what if she moves
to crush them?

25:12.545 --> 25:13.777
MARY:
I have to believe

25:13.779 --> 25:15.679
that if she's determined
to protect me,

25:15.681 --> 25:17.681
that she will protect
my people as well.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.884
Harm either party,

25:19.886 --> 25:21.886
and there will be
a movement against her.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.523
Is this truly
what you want to do?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.825
For all you know, Darnley
is on his way right now.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.593
His mother insisted that

25:29.595 --> 25:31.128
he only needed to be convinced

25:31.130 --> 25:32.897
that your interest in him
was real.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.833
He is still an option, Mary.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.968
A road to you
controlling both nations.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.738
After much bloodshed
and upheaval.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.774
So you're decided.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.009
I'm not.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.878
That is why I am here,
asking for your advice.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.320
I understand why this
is tempting for you,

25:56.322 --> 25:57.621
I do.

25:57.623 --> 25:58.689
But mistrust of the English

25:58.691 --> 26:00.958
runs deep with our people.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.193
And you will counsel peace.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.829
And Scotland, and its people

26:05.831 --> 26:09.133
who have suffered for so long
will have it.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.069
I know I've asked a lot of you,

26:12.071 --> 26:14.138
to prove yourself to me.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.907
Emily Knox, Clan Gordon.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.943
But you have shown
your true loyalty,

26:18.945 --> 26:20.778
not just to me, but to Scotland.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.880
I can't even begin

26:22.882 --> 26:24.615
to consider this

26:24.617 --> 26:25.816
unless I know that
you will be here,

26:25.818 --> 26:27.151
as Scotland's protector.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.990
Even if you decide
you want to do this,

26:32.992 --> 26:34.959
no Scotsman will accept

26:34.961 --> 26:36.860
that you willingly
forfeited your crown.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.933
You have to show them.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.336
You poisoned a blind man?

26:45.338 --> 26:47.638
He wasn't blind
until I poisoned him.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.873
Don't make it sound so cruel.

26:49.875 --> 26:54.311
You need to tell him
that God spoke to you.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.380
That the Lord himself insists

26:56.382 --> 26:58.816
Cardinal Rosales
returns to Spain.

26:58.818 --> 26:59.850
You can improvise
if you like,

26:59.852 --> 27:01.652
just make sure you sell it.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.387
It's a joke to you, isn't it?

27:03.389 --> 27:06.757
Religion?

27:06.759 --> 27:07.891
Well, I have find
comfort in it,

27:07.893 --> 27:09.760
since Leith died.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.962
That's wonderful, darling,
but you're no saint.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.897
You could be a savior

27:13.899 --> 27:15.666
to France.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.936
Spain is an aggressive nation,

27:18.938 --> 27:20.871
keen on expansion.

27:20.873 --> 27:24.208
And if we don't push back,
they're gonna swallow us whole.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.278
Please, help us send
Rosales back to Spain.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.980
Not to mention, you know,

27:29.982 --> 27:32.149
all those awful things
that your sister said

27:32.151 --> 27:34.885
about you, and about Leith.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.421
This could be your chance
to give her a good spanking

27:37.423 --> 27:39.356
for being so cruel.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.293
All right.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.995

27:54.940 --> 27:57.941
James, I was wondering
if I could speak with you

27:57.943 --> 27:59.677
about Emily Knox.

27:59.679 --> 28:02.046
I realize I may
be overstepping,

28:02.048 --> 28:03.714
but I've seen the way
she looks at you.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.049
She's a naive girl

28:05.051 --> 28:07.151
married to a harsh
and powerful man.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.886
There are so many
available women,

28:08.888 --> 28:10.921
do you need to pursue her?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.191
I'm not sure I need to at all.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.061
You needn't fear for her.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.930
In time, I hope no one needs
to fear John Knox as well.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.231
But until then,

39:12.617 --> 39:13.717
(horses neighing)

39:13.719 --> 39:15.418
It appears as though

39:15.420 --> 39:17.687
we still have a queen this day.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.023
(inhales)

39:20.025 --> 39:22.792
Oh, Mary.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.903
(birds chirping)

39:33.905 --> 39:35.505
Lord Moray.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.107
You startled me.

39:37.109 --> 39:40.009
Please. Call me James.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.749
I see the English ambassador
has taken his leave.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.050
Indeed he has.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.086
Perhaps you were right
about destiny after all.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.721
Seems there are things that

39:51.723 --> 39:54.057
even a queen herself
cannot escape.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.060
So you've come to accept
that our lives are predestined?

39:57.062 --> 40:00.630
I have come to accept
that some things

40:00.632 --> 40:02.065
are meant to be,

40:02.067 --> 40:04.067
even if they
violate our duties,

40:04.069 --> 40:06.536
our oaths.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.707
To break an oath
is a great sin.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.845
To break a heart
is an even greater one.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.682
Do you believe
the Lord

40:19.684 --> 40:21.851
can forgive all sins?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.987
I'm counting on it.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.089
(exhales)

40:26.091 --> 40:28.625
I trusted your offer
to Mary was true.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.460
But the fact that peace
has... has once again

40:30.462 --> 40:32.929
eluded this country
lays firmly at your own feet.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.498
You're blaming me for this?

40:35.500 --> 40:37.000
Mary had agreed.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.768
She was going to abdicate,

40:38.770 --> 40:41.738
marry me... we were gonna
have a life together.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.707
Until she learned that you had
promised her not a home,

40:44.709 --> 40:48.144
but a fortified estate
meant to wall her in.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.846
Do you deny it?

40:49.848 --> 40:52.182
Modifications had been
in progress at Sandown Castle

40:52.184 --> 40:53.550
for months.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.485
It was not intended for Mary,

40:55.487 --> 40:57.987
but when<i> you</i> came to me
with<i> your</i> proposal,

40:57.989 --> 40:59.489
it seemed the perfect place.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.858
Queens will always
need protection.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.060
From those within
and those without.

41:04.062 --> 41:07.130
You were going to make her your
prisoner, and I was the bait.

41:07.132 --> 41:11.067
If Mary had accepted my deal,
she would've been safe from me,

41:11.069 --> 41:13.970
that is what
I promised and I meant it.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.206
But even then there would be
factions of people

41:16.208 --> 41:20.210
who would not rest until either
Mary or I were dead.

41:20.212 --> 41:23.680
Those walls were
for her protection.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.782
And now,
that she remains queen...?

41:25.784 --> 41:28.618
As long as Mary lives
and breathes,

41:28.620 --> 41:30.820
neither of us is safe.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.757
Only one queen can survive.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.262
And I intend it to be me.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.698
