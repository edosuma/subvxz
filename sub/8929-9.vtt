( dramatic theme playing )

00:10.601 --> 00:11.634
( roars )

00:11.735 --> 00:14.268
â™ª Beast Wars

00:14.369 --> 00:16.102
( dramatic rock theme playing )

00:29.170 --> 00:31.171
â™ª Beast Wars

00:32.404 --> 00:34.405
( dramatic theme playing )

00:47.574 --> 00:50.741
( grunting )

00:52.941 --> 00:54.241
Oh, no.

00:54.341 --> 00:57.542
Waspinator tired of this.

00:59.042 --> 01:02.743
Oh, bomb its holes, see?

01:02.843 --> 01:04.643
It's not a bomb, you bug.

01:04.744 --> 01:06.477
Huh? It's a sonic emitter.

01:06.577 --> 01:08.211
And when we've placed it correctly,

01:08.311 --> 01:10.044
it'll blow a sweet little door

01:10.144 --> 01:12.778
right in the bottom of the Maximals' base.

01:12.878 --> 01:15.412
We have to widen the tunnel.

01:15.512 --> 01:17.612
So widen.

01:17.712 --> 01:21.846
I'm soiled enough already, just being around you two.

01:21.946 --> 01:26.713
Hmph. You spiders can get your own homes.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.148
Megatron said dig.

01:34.382 --> 01:37.181
So start digging.

01:37.281 --> 01:38.448
Oh.

01:40.349 --> 01:42.649
I'm the brains of this group.

01:44.117 --> 01:45.450
Not the brawn.

01:45.549 --> 01:46.617
( gasps )

01:50.717 --> 01:52.485
( bomb hums )

01:58.718 --> 02:02.686
( laughing )

02:02.786 --> 02:06.553
( roars )

02:06.653 --> 02:10.021
Tangler guns target intruders with plastine coils.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.154
( groans )

02:11.254 --> 02:13.788
That gives the stun guns and Cybertron fields

02:13.888 --> 02:16.422
time to set up for the knockout punch.

02:16.522 --> 02:17.622
( laughs )

02:17.722 --> 02:21.956
Beastobot. Old Sentinel here takes him down.

02:22.056 --> 02:24.890
You said, "make the base impregnable."

02:24.990 --> 02:26.024
( laughs )

02:26.124 --> 02:27.523
Well done.

02:27.623 --> 02:30.124
How long before Sentinel's fully operational?

02:30.224 --> 02:34.592
Hm, three or four mega-cycles, depending on-- What?

02:34.691 --> 02:37.759
( alarm beeping )

02:37.859 --> 02:41.559
Hey, big bot, there's a Predacon making a scene in Sector 19.

02:41.659 --> 02:43.659
Looks like Waspinator.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.627
( buttons beep )

02:46.726 --> 02:49.460
That's the third Predacon we've spotted in that sector

02:49.560 --> 02:51.560
in the last three days.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.228
Hm.

02:53.328 --> 02:55.528
Cheetor, contact Tigatron.

02:55.628 --> 02:57.995
Have him meet me at coordinates 4-5-8.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.162
( ominous theme playing )

03:06.196 --> 03:07.497
( muttering )

03:07.597 --> 03:11.765
No, Waspinator's sick of taking orders.

03:11.864 --> 03:16.031
Waspinator is greatest of Predacons.

03:17.132 --> 03:19.665
Waspinator rules.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.632
( chuckling )

03:23.832 --> 03:25.800
( growls )

03:25.900 --> 03:26.933
( twigs snap ) Hm?

03:27.033 --> 03:29.267
Not many can creep up on me like that.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.401
Well, you can learn a lot from Rattrap.

03:31.501 --> 03:33.301
If you can stand him.

03:33.402 --> 03:38.002
( muttering ): Stupid Megatron.

03:38.102 --> 03:40.902
Looks like Waspinator's been on a sugar binge.

03:41.002 --> 03:42.736
Hm.

03:42.836 --> 03:44.369
So how long has he been doing that?

03:44.469 --> 03:46.437
Long enough to make my head spin.

03:46.537 --> 03:47.804
Shall I bring him down?

03:47.903 --> 03:50.670
No, let me shake him up a little, see where he runs.

03:50.771 --> 03:52.605
You follow on the ground in case I lose him.

03:52.704 --> 03:53.605
Hm.

03:53.705 --> 03:55.405
Optimus Primal, maximize.

04:03.173 --> 04:05.440
Oh, one day, Megatron see

04:05.540 --> 04:09.974
Waspinator is true leader of Predacons. Then--

04:11.374 --> 04:13.141
( groans )

04:14.307 --> 04:17.776
( buzzing )

04:22.143 --> 04:23.143
What?

04:29.177 --> 04:31.944
Optimus Primal.

04:32.045 --> 04:34.445
( dramatic theme playing )

04:39.445 --> 04:41.779
( panting )

04:47.180 --> 04:48.414
( snorts )

04:48.514 --> 04:50.881
Tanglers, stun guns.

04:50.981 --> 04:51.881
Oof!

04:51.981 --> 04:54.581
What sort of defense grid is this?

04:54.681 --> 04:56.882
What's gumming your gears?

04:56.982 --> 05:01.449
Those toys won't stop Predacons in battle mode.

05:01.549 --> 05:05.783
Lethal threats demand lethal response.

05:07.183 --> 05:09.084
Oh, yeah?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.784
Well, respond to this, chopper face.

05:11.884 --> 05:13.418
( beeping )

05:13.518 --> 05:14.518
( growls )

05:17.152 --> 05:18.452
( gasps )

05:18.552 --> 05:20.052
( grunts )

05:21.619 --> 05:23.952
( groans )

05:24.052 --> 05:25.586
( laughs )

05:25.686 --> 05:29.287
The tanglers worked pretty good on old Dino-butt, heh.

05:29.387 --> 05:31.888
Maybe Preds aren't as lethal as they think?

05:31.988 --> 05:34.821
( roaring )

05:40.456 --> 05:42.656
Uh-oh. Incoming.

05:44.990 --> 05:46.689
( screams )

05:57.992 --> 05:59.758
( gasps )

05:59.858 --> 06:02.325
SENTINEL: Warning. Invader alert.

06:02.426 --> 06:06.959
Sentinel online. Acquiring targets.

06:07.059 --> 06:09.293
Show's over, Rhinox. Shut it down.

06:09.393 --> 06:13.594
How? The console's junk, thanks to you and Dinobot.

06:16.128 --> 06:17.529
( groaning )

06:17.629 --> 06:18.928
Hey, what's going on?

06:19.028 --> 06:21.163
Sentinel thinks we're intruders.

06:21.263 --> 06:22.929
We've got to get out of here!

06:23.029 --> 06:24.530
Help Dinobot!

06:26.396 --> 06:30.030
Whoa, what about the friend-or-foe program?

06:30.130 --> 06:33.464
That's what I was installing when you pulled this stunt!

06:33.564 --> 06:35.532
Uh, ahem, oops.

06:35.632 --> 06:39.532
SENTINEL: Defense grid armed and ready.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.999
Let's move.

06:42.099 --> 06:43.166
( pants )

06:46.633 --> 06:49.233
Rattrap, what are you doing?

06:51.001 --> 06:53.168
We can't abandon the base.

06:53.268 --> 06:56.134
And since I turned this thing on,

06:56.234 --> 06:58.601
I'm the one who's gotta turn it off.

07:00.102 --> 07:04.769
Oh, man. I'm starting to sound like Optimus Pinhead.

07:04.869 --> 07:08.069
Rattrap!

07:08.170 --> 07:09.204
( grunts )

07:12.337 --> 07:14.371
( dramatic theme playing )

07:20.338 --> 07:24.506
Waspinator must warn others.

07:30.873 --> 07:31.707
( gasps )

07:31.808 --> 07:33.141
( yells )

07:35.341 --> 07:36.275
( grunts )

07:36.375 --> 07:38.408
Optimus.

07:38.508 --> 07:40.508
( yells )

07:42.009 --> 07:44.276
( sighs )

07:46.943 --> 07:48.910
Ah, no place to hide.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.243
So where is he?

07:51.343 --> 07:52.244
( groans )

07:52.344 --> 07:54.478
Warning. Energon surge.

07:54.578 --> 07:56.945
( panting )

08:01.312 --> 08:02.212
Did you see him?

08:02.312 --> 08:06.680
No. But I can still smell him.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.547
He's here somewhere.

08:08.647 --> 08:10.381
( growls softly )

08:10.480 --> 08:11.847
( beeping ) SENTINEL: Maximal alert.

08:11.947 --> 08:14.014
Intruders have infiltrated base.

08:14.114 --> 08:15.848
Sentinel now at Level 1.

08:15.948 --> 08:16.848
Sentinel?

08:16.948 --> 08:18.348
Who is Sentinel?

08:18.449 --> 08:21.715
Our new defense grid. But it-- It shouldn't be online yet.

08:21.816 --> 08:24.483
It might be wise for you to return.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.616
I'll hunt down Waspinator.

08:26.716 --> 08:29.150
Yes. Something's going on in this sector,

08:29.250 --> 08:30.751
and I wanna know what it is.

08:30.850 --> 08:32.684
I'll send backup as soon as I can.

08:32.784 --> 08:36.118
I need no help hunting Predacons.

08:36.218 --> 08:39.418
And I prefer to prowl alone.

08:42.352 --> 08:44.352
Field divers at 15 percent.

08:44.453 --> 08:46.986
Suggest transformation back to beast mode.

08:47.086 --> 08:47.986
( sighs )

08:48.086 --> 08:49.287
I have to risk it.

08:49.387 --> 08:52.154
Jets online, maximum burn.

08:54.488 --> 08:56.488
( dramatic rock theme playing )

08:59.222 --> 09:01.722
SENTINEL: Unauthorized personnel detected.

09:01.823 --> 09:03.923
( alarm beeping )

09:04.023 --> 09:06.290
Perimeter shield activated.

09:08.223 --> 09:11.024
Gigabomber! Sentinel's locked us out.

09:11.124 --> 09:12.757
Rattrap, come in.

09:12.857 --> 09:15.658
Rattrap, do you read me?

09:17.058 --> 09:20.325
Slag. The shield's jamming our comm links.

09:20.425 --> 09:24.059
Apparently, you've built a better mousetrap.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.760
( ominous theme playing )

09:46.796 --> 09:48.063
( beeps )

09:53.198 --> 09:54.231
( scoffing )

09:54.331 --> 09:56.164
Zero friction forward, heh!

09:56.264 --> 09:57.832
Come on, Rhinox.

09:57.932 --> 10:00.832
That stuff is strictly for amateurs.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.033
( upbeat theme playing )

10:06.600 --> 10:07.966
( clattering ) ( gasps)

10:08.066 --> 10:10.733
( barrier hums )

10:10.834 --> 10:13.434
( grunts )

10:13.534 --> 10:16.434
Now this ain't a security grid. It's a gym.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.968
Just for spy guys like me.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.068
( chuckles )

10:19.168 --> 10:20.168
( gunshots ) ( gasps )

10:22.302 --> 10:23.735
One and two and stretch.

10:23.836 --> 10:26.136
Now bend, now lift. Feel the burn.

10:26.236 --> 10:28.237
( laughing ): Yeah.

10:40.271 --> 10:41.439
( sniffs )

10:41.538 --> 10:43.439
The trail leads here.

10:43.539 --> 10:44.606
( sniffs )

10:44.706 --> 10:47.973
But something's not right.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.941
Ha!

10:53.041 --> 10:54.941
( sighs )

10:59.242 --> 11:00.942
( machine humming )

11:01.042 --> 11:05.476
A hollow projector, hm? Clever.

11:10.977 --> 11:12.677
( growling )

11:38.248 --> 11:40.982
Well, we can't blast our way through it.

11:41.082 --> 11:43.082
( groaning )

11:43.182 --> 11:44.950
Oh, no. The energon fields

11:45.049 --> 11:46.649
are starting to mess with our circuits.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.083
Transform to beast mode.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.586
What's going on, Rhinox?

12:01.686 --> 12:04.953
I got a message from Sentinel about intruders in the base.

12:05.053 --> 12:09.286
It's talking about Rattrap. He's trapped inside.

12:09.386 --> 12:12.854
And if we don't figure a way to deactivate Sentinel soon,

12:12.954 --> 12:14.955
he's toast.

12:15.054 --> 12:17.055
( dramatic theme playing )

12:25.956 --> 12:27.857
( grunting )

12:30.957 --> 12:31.990
SENTINEL: Intruder.

12:32.090 --> 12:34.958
You are required to stand down.

12:35.058 --> 12:38.692
Hey! Whoa! Ugh.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.692
Cryofields and disruptive bolts!

12:41.692 --> 12:46.693
( grunts )

12:46.793 --> 12:50.193
Keep it up, Sentinel. You don't have a chance.

12:50.293 --> 12:53.894
'Cause I'm a stealth fighter, a master marksman, and...

12:56.261 --> 12:58.495
a demolition expert.

13:03.496 --> 13:04.963
Hm.

13:05.063 --> 13:06.196
SENTINEL: Resistance persists.

13:06.296 --> 13:08.597
Upgrading program.

13:08.697 --> 13:13.731
Oh, man. There won't be enough left of me to fill a teaspoon.

13:18.499 --> 13:19.965
( gasps )

13:20.065 --> 13:21.866
No! Ah!

13:23.499 --> 13:24.532
( grunts )

13:25.700 --> 13:28.967
( grunts )

13:29.067 --> 13:30.067
Oof!

13:31.334 --> 13:33.167
Now, I have to get to the core

13:33.267 --> 13:37.568
and show this hunk of junk what it means to mess with me.

13:45.736 --> 13:51.604
No, Waspinator says we must deal with Optimus first.

13:51.704 --> 13:55.538
Tigatron, maximize, stealth mode.

14:03.606 --> 14:05.906
( Predacons chattering indistinctively )

14:10.974 --> 14:13.307
WASPINATOR: ...is greatest of Predacons.

14:14.441 --> 14:15.708
Huh?

14:24.642 --> 14:27.776
TERRORSAUR: Optimus will never find us here.

14:27.877 --> 14:31.410
BLACKARACHNIA: And even if he does, he'll be too late.

14:31.511 --> 14:34.077
The emitter is ready.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.878
In 15 cycles, we'll be inside the Maximal base.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.278
( snarling )

14:39.378 --> 14:42.612
The only place you three are going is the slag heap.

14:44.546 --> 14:45.913
Ooh!

14:46.913 --> 14:48.779
( grunting )

14:51.580 --> 14:54.547
Ugh! He's stolen my invention!

14:54.647 --> 14:57.581
Predacons, terrorize!

15:18.285 --> 15:19.452
Where did he go?

15:19.552 --> 15:22.019
Right here, Predacon.

15:22.118 --> 15:23.019
( whines )

15:23.119 --> 15:24.019
( screeches )

15:24.119 --> 15:26.453
You can't win, cat.

15:26.553 --> 15:29.187
The emitter will explode and take you with it.

15:29.286 --> 15:32.787
In that case, allow me to return it.

15:34.487 --> 15:36.154
No!

15:36.255 --> 15:38.688
Let's get out of here!

15:40.221 --> 15:42.222
( dramatic rock theme playing )

15:45.122 --> 15:46.122
( grunts )

16:00.658 --> 16:02.792
Jumping gyros, what was that?

16:02.892 --> 16:04.893
Let's find out. Battle mode.

16:13.427 --> 16:15.427
( dramatic rock theme playing )

16:29.763 --> 16:31.297
( grunting )

16:33.364 --> 16:36.564
Tigatron? Uh, what is this?

16:36.664 --> 16:40.398
It's a long and very ugly story.

16:40.498 --> 16:41.498
I wanna hear it.

16:41.598 --> 16:44.266
Soon as we deal with our other problem.

16:44.366 --> 16:46.366
Problem?

17:11.236 --> 17:12.603
( grunts )

17:22.171 --> 17:24.906
SENTINEL: Unauthorized access to computer core.

17:27.873 --> 17:28.873
( grunts )

17:39.508 --> 17:40.842
( panting )

17:42.341 --> 17:43.675
( screaming )

17:46.142 --> 17:47.309
Ugh!

17:47.409 --> 17:48.409
( grunts )

17:49.943 --> 17:52.043
( screams )

17:52.143 --> 17:53.677
( grunts )

17:58.244 --> 18:00.245
( grunting )

18:00.344 --> 18:02.546
Cool your circuits, kid.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.712
It's just the exterminator,

18:04.812 --> 18:08.413
here to blow a few bugs out of your system.

18:14.281 --> 18:17.081
And the four identification codes.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.182
( sighing )

18:18.282 --> 18:20.415
Where did Rhinox put them?

18:22.048 --> 18:23.115
Yes!

18:25.249 --> 18:26.516
Uh-oh.

18:26.616 --> 18:29.349
SENTINEL: Shatter field online.

18:33.417 --> 18:34.417
( grunts )

18:39.251 --> 18:40.251
( screams )

18:44.919 --> 18:46.152
SENTINEL: Target locked.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.020
Preparing to terminate.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.954
Ooh, come on.

19:00.788 --> 19:03.389
Hey, the shield went down.

19:03.489 --> 19:05.023
No.

19:05.122 --> 19:06.789
What is it, Rhinox?

19:06.889 --> 19:09.256
Sentinel wouldn't drop the shield

19:09.356 --> 19:13.324
if an intruder was still active.

19:13.424 --> 19:18.158
Rattrap gone? No way.

19:18.257 --> 19:22.025
No, I don't believe it.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.725
He was a difficult Maximal to deal with.

19:24.825 --> 19:27.259
At times impossible.

19:27.359 --> 19:29.560
But I'll remember him with honor.

19:29.660 --> 19:34.027
I won't disgrace his memory with lies.

19:34.127 --> 19:39.695
He was a stinking, omnivorous pestilence.

19:39.795 --> 19:43.728
Still in some perverse way, I will miss him.

19:43.828 --> 19:47.963
Sure, he smelled bad. He was a rat.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.297
But he was my best friend.

20:03.798 --> 20:04.899
Huh?

20:04.998 --> 20:07.300
Oh, boo. Boo-hoo.

20:07.399 --> 20:10.600
Oh, don't stop now.

20:10.700 --> 20:13.567
You motorheads are killing me.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.501
Rattrap? How did you--?

20:15.601 --> 20:17.534
--avoid getting scrapped?

20:17.634 --> 20:20.701
Well, it was no oil bath, but, uh, let's face it,

20:20.801 --> 20:24.235
ain't a defense system made that I can't get around.

20:24.335 --> 20:26.069
Right, Sentinel?

20:26.169 --> 20:28.202
SENTINEL ( beeps ): Acknowledged.

20:28.303 --> 20:32.836
Eh, you just gotta know how to talk to him.

20:32.937 --> 20:34.804
( Optimus laughs )

20:37.370 --> 20:39.371
( dramatic theme plays )

20:41.138 --> 20:42.538

20:43.705 --> 20:45.739
