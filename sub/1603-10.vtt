03:54.540 --> 03:56.106
I'm so sorry.

03:56.108 --> 03:58.875
We gonna go to
your daddy's house,

03:58.877 --> 04:01.110
and we gonna sign away
your shares

04:01.112 --> 04:03.278
so the company
can become public.

04:05.047 --> 04:08.382
This is all happening
because of you, Dre.

04:08.384 --> 04:09.816
JAMAL: Dre, it's all
'cause of you.

04:09.818 --> 04:11.117
Know what I'm saying?
Empire going public.

04:11.119 --> 04:12.351
We wouldn't even know
what IPO was

04:12.353 --> 04:13.552
if it wasn't for you.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.687
HAKEEM:
And Dad still needs you.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.890
You know he can't bring this

04:18.892 --> 04:20.658
Come here. Come here.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.894
I don't what's gonna happen...

04:23.896 --> 04:25.195
but whatever

04:25.197 --> 04:27.363
that judge says,

04:27.365 --> 04:29.798
I want you to remember
Mommy loves you.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.768
Don't you ever
forget that, okay?

04:39.540 --> 04:42.241

RHONDA: I know.

04:42.243 --> 04:45.544
(sniffles)

04:53.886 --> 04:57.488
So you really are trying
to give Cookie

04:57.490 --> 05:00.090
the same amount of shares
as the boys, huh?

05:00.092 --> 05:03.193
My way of thinking is,
if she has her own,

05:03.195 --> 05:05.528
she's not gonna give
me that much trouble

05:05.530 --> 05:08.030
when I ask her to
sign the prenup.

05:08.032 --> 05:09.231
Come on, man,
you're not seriously thinking

05:09.233 --> 05:10.732
about marrying her again?

05:10.734 --> 05:12.900
I want to spend the rest
of my life with Cookie.

05:12.902 --> 05:17.337
Having my family with me before
I die-- that's what's important.

05:17.339 --> 05:19.005
Well, if family's important
to you, you need to go

05:19.007 --> 05:21.607
to the hospital
and see Andre.

05:21.609 --> 05:23.041
(sighs)

05:23.043 --> 05:25.276
Yeah, I don't want
to see him like that.

05:25.278 --> 05:29.680
I'll see him at the house when
we do the transfer of the stock.

05:29.682 --> 05:32.849
Okay. So you think Cookie's
gonna be okay with this?

05:32.851 --> 05:37.085
Cookie missed out on
raising our-our boys.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.353
We got a second
chance now with Lola.

05:39.355 --> 05:41.755
She loves her.

05:41.757 --> 05:44.557
Yeah, me, Lola and Cookie.

05:44.559 --> 05:46.725
I'm gonna get it
right this time.

05:46.727 --> 05:48.793
Oh.

05:48.795 --> 05:52.696
We got reasons
to be cheerful, bro.

05:52.698 --> 05:55.031
Can't believe we're about
to take this thing public.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.466
After all these years. Come on,
now, don't leave me hanging.

05:57.468 --> 06:00.202
We?

06:00.204 --> 06:02.437
You mean me.

06:02.439 --> 06:05.539
This is mine.
I built this.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.610
Yeah, right.

06:10.612 --> 06:12.612
So this is about
me and Dre, huh?

06:12.614 --> 06:15.748
And the temporary
incapacitation, now.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.316
We were trying
to protect you, bro.

06:17.318 --> 06:21.586
Yeah. You tried
to pull a cool on me.

06:21.588 --> 06:25.589
Now, Andre I expect that from
because he's book-smart,

06:25.591 --> 06:28.792
but you-- you from the streets.

06:28.794 --> 06:31.060
You ought to know better.

06:31.062 --> 06:33.462
At least I thought you did.

06:39.468 --> 06:42.302
All right.
Like you said, all right?

06:44.138 --> 06:45.971
This is all you, right?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.408
This your company.

07:01.553 --> 07:02.920
(knocking)

07:02.922 --> 07:04.320
Come in.

07:07.023 --> 07:08.523
May I have a word?

07:08.525 --> 07:10.358
Uh-oh.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.625
Did I violate

07:11.627 --> 07:13.293
some top secret,
super classified

07:13.295 --> 07:14.894
security code?
No.

07:14.896 --> 07:17.529
I'm the one that
violated the code.

07:17.531 --> 07:20.064
My own personal
code of conduct.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.399
And that's a problem.
Yeah, well,

07:22.401 --> 07:24.567
I'm sure you know
I got a nasty rap sheet,

07:24.569 --> 07:26.969
so I'm not really one to judge.

07:26.971 --> 07:30.305
Well, I've been disloyal
to my commander

07:30.307 --> 07:31.739
by falling for his wife.

07:31.741 --> 07:34.742
That is
a serious breach

07:34.744 --> 07:37.211
of every pledge I've ever sworn.

07:37.213 --> 07:38.745
So I hope you understand

07:38.747 --> 07:41.914
I will be keeping my distance,
and...

07:41.916 --> 07:44.416
I didn't want you to think
I wasn't, you know, around.

07:44.418 --> 07:46.918
Yeah.
Um, wait.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.719
Are you saying
you're falling for me?

07:48.721 --> 07:51.455
I'm saying that

07:51.457 --> 07:53.356
I can't stop thinking
about you.

07:54.424 --> 07:56.124
And I'm sorry if I overstepped.

07:57.326 --> 07:58.793
Malcolm...

08:16.077 --> 08:17.577
You want to leave?

08:17.579 --> 08:18.678

My man. Kudos.

09:19.661 --> 09:21.527
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

09:21.529 --> 09:23.896
I got to ask you something
about it, though. It's...

09:23.898 --> 09:26.565
What's up?

09:26.567 --> 09:27.899
(sighs)

09:27.901 --> 09:29.367
Is it just a
song, or is...

09:29.369 --> 09:30.801
is that really you?

09:30.803 --> 09:33.370
Oh.

09:33.372 --> 09:35.372
I mean, I don't
think that Lola

09:35.374 --> 09:36.806
should be staying
with my dad.

09:36.808 --> 09:39.241
You know, especially
since Anika's gone.

09:39.243 --> 09:41.576
Thinking about taking her
off his hands.

09:41.578 --> 09:43.244
That's a big step.

09:43.246 --> 09:44.878
Yeah, you were
the one that told me

09:44.880 --> 09:46.479
I should spend time
with her, right?

09:46.481 --> 09:48.747
Yeah, I know.
It's...

09:48.749 --> 09:51.316
I respect your decision,
Jamal, so much.

09:51.318 --> 09:54.085
Like...
it's beyond.

09:54.087 --> 09:56.854
I don't know, I guess
you're a better man than me.

09:56.856 --> 09:58.088
Ryan, come on, man.
It's not like I'm

09:58.090 --> 09:59.489
asking you to co-parent
or something.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.157
I know. Obviously,
we're not there yet.

10:01.159 --> 10:02.558
I-I know. It's just...
it's not something

10:02.560 --> 10:03.992
that I see taking on.

10:06.161 --> 10:07.928
Right.

10:07.930 --> 10:10.396
I respect
your decision, too.

10:12.031 --> 10:14.064
Doesn't change mine, though.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.934
She's my daughter.

10:17.936 --> 10:19.635
I want to raise her.

10:24.072 --> 10:25.405
Right here.
All right.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.839
All right.

10:26.841 --> 10:30.042

Well, look what I found.

10:30.044 --> 10:31.710
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

10:31.712 --> 10:33.011
Where's Lola?

10:33.013 --> 10:35.513
Reg, please.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.882
See, you can run,
but you can't hide.

10:37.884 --> 10:40.084
(whimpers) And don't
walk away from Daddy.

10:40.086 --> 10:41.351
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:41.353 --> 10:44.420
Let's go get Lola.

10:44.422 --> 10:45.721
All right?

10:45.723 --> 10:47.456
Just walk.

I'm not going.

you're not going?

I don't care about winning.
Well, you can't

just stay here.

12:48.687 --> 12:51.454
Why not?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.857
Because...

12:55.859 --> 12:58.359
I need you, Andre.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.893

I had Vernon

13:08.201 --> 13:10.000
prepare a signed
power of attorney.

13:10.002 --> 13:12.402
It's in an envelope
at the front desk.

13:12.404 --> 13:15.138
You get the hell out of here.

13:22.813 --> 13:24.814

13:24.816 --> 13:27.183
Oh, really? Well, look,

13:27.185 --> 13:31.820
Lola-bear is very sleepy and
wants you to close your eyes.

13:32.922 --> 13:35.556
But-but Scary Bird
is gonna get us.

13:35.558 --> 13:37.558
What's Scary Bird?
Is that a monster?

13:37.560 --> 13:39.426
Hmm?

13:39.428 --> 13:41.094
All right.

13:41.096 --> 13:43.529
I promise
I won't let him get you.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.364
He tries to hurt Mommy.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.932
There's no Scary Birds here,
baby.

13:46.934 --> 13:49.334
Well, I'll
tell you what.

13:49.336 --> 13:51.102
There's definitely
no Scary Birds at my house.

13:51.104 --> 13:54.004
Think you'd want to
come live with me?

13:54.006 --> 13:55.672
Will Mommy be there?

13:55.674 --> 13:59.409
No, but... I'll protect you.

13:59.411 --> 14:01.844
I promise I'll never let
anything hurt you.

14:01.846 --> 14:03.879
What do you say?

14:03.881 --> 14:05.213
Want to come live with Daddy?

14:05.215 --> 14:06.514
Yes.

14:39.575 --> 14:41.541
What are you talking about,
Lucious?

14:41.543 --> 14:43.543
That's what
you wanted.

14:43.545 --> 14:45.177
Position's open.

14:45.179 --> 14:48.413
Well, whatever
Cookie wants,

14:48.415 --> 14:50.548

14:50.550 --> 14:53.817
I want you
to be a better father.

14:53.819 --> 14:56.719
I want you to think
about what our sons need

14:56.721 --> 15:00.488
instead of being so self-serving
all the time.

15:00.490 --> 15:02.223
And...

15:02.225 --> 15:05.426
I want to produce

I should step up.

17:25.104 --> 17:27.137

17:27.139 --> 17:29.005

Uh, Mr. Lyon,

17:46.519 --> 17:48.552
your son has a serious
mental illness.

17:48.554 --> 17:50.353
If he gets the right
care, he can lead...

17:50.355 --> 17:51.687
Shut the hell up.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.955
Gone. Y'all get out of here.

17:53.957 --> 17:55.623
Wait, wait. Where are they
taking him, though?

17:55.625 --> 17:57.458
Your brother's been working
too hard at school.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.127
He just needs
a little vacation.

18:00.129 --> 18:01.728
And you, little rich white girl,

18:01.730 --> 18:05.231
don't you dare share this
with nobody at your school.

18:05.233 --> 18:07.199
This is a family matter.

18:07.201 --> 18:08.800
I won't say anything.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.003
Mental illness?

18:13.005 --> 18:14.170
No!

18:14.172 --> 18:16.372
No one will
refer to my son

18:16.374 --> 18:18.407
as having a mental illness.
It's all right.

18:18.409 --> 18:20.142

18:37.191 --> 18:41.226
Hey. I need to report

18:41.228 --> 18:42.727
You're talking
about the violation

18:42.729 --> 18:44.495
that's taking place
in the dining room

18:44.497 --> 18:46.497
of the Lyons' residence,
I'm on that, ma'am.

18:46.499 --> 18:48.932
Do you have a camera on me?
(laughs)

18:48.934 --> 18:50.767
Where is it?

18:50.769 --> 18:53.336
Oh, it's looking out
from that picture, isn't it?

18:53.338 --> 18:54.837
Mm-hmm.

18:54.839 --> 18:57.606
I'm gonna give you a reason
to arrest me

18:57.608 --> 18:59.608
for indecent exposure.

18:59.610 --> 19:01.676
I'm tracking you
with your phone's GPS.

19:01.678 --> 19:03.844
There is no camera.

19:03.846 --> 19:05.512
(laughs)

19:05.514 --> 19:08.781
Well, too bad, 'cause I'm not
wearing any panties.

19:08.783 --> 19:11.183
(chuckles) Well, I still want
to handcuff you.

19:11.185 --> 19:13.718
Ooh, you talking dirty
to me, daddy.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.620
Baby, guess who decided
out of nowhere

19:16.622 --> 19:19.089
that they want to be a daddy.

19:19.091 --> 19:22.559
Uh, Carol, girl, uh,
you know I told you,

19:22.561 --> 19:24.260
you got to have that oil
bubbling hot

19:24.262 --> 19:25.694
when you put your chicken in.

19:25.696 --> 19:27.095
Yeah, so call me later.

19:27.097 --> 19:29.097
Let me know how it works out.
All right, bye.

19:29.099 --> 19:31.232
He's doing the right thing,
Lucious.

19:31.234 --> 19:32.933
You need to support him.

19:32.935 --> 19:34.901
I have been,
but you know that...

19:34.903 --> 19:36.435
that Lola belongs here.

19:36.437 --> 19:37.803
And I recall...

19:37.805 --> 19:40.772
you wanting to raise
a little girl.

19:40.774 --> 19:41.906
What are you...?

19:41.908 --> 19:43.607
Well, looky here.
Hey.

19:43.609 --> 19:46.610
Y'all all coordinated.
See, Lucious?

19:46.612 --> 19:48.044
You just got to coordinate.

19:48.046 --> 19:49.378
HAKEEM: Hey, yo, I hope
y'all don't mind,

19:49.380 --> 19:51.213
I brought Camilla.
We've got a new song

19:51.215 --> 19:52.814
we want to play
for y'all tonight.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.817
Oh. So, Yoko, you got the
tambourine under that fur?

19:55.819 --> 19:57.585
HAKEEM: Cut it out, Ma. (laughs)

19:57.587 --> 19:58.886
Can we be civil, Cookie?

19:58.888 --> 20:00.053
For Hakeem's sake?

20:00.055 --> 20:01.754
Yeah, okay.

20:01.756 --> 20:03.722
For Hakeem's sake.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.956
'Cause I love
you, Hakeem.

20:08.159 --> 20:12.895
She got her drawers wrapped
around my baby's neck.

20:12.897 --> 20:15.597
He can't breathe.

20:15.599 --> 20:16.965
JAMAL:
That's a good one. Yeah.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.166
HAKEEM:
She's designing all my looks.

20:18.168 --> 20:19.834
Look how cute he looks there.

20:19.836 --> 20:21.168
That's a good one.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.170
HAKEEM: That's how
you build our brand.

20:23.172 --> 20:24.971
And Camilla had some
extra material,

20:24.973 --> 20:26.839
so she made me a scarf.

20:26.841 --> 20:29.308
Aw, fool, looks good.
You look chic.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.843
She say we're like the new
Antony and Cleopatra.

20:31.845 --> 20:33.144
(laughs) Child...

20:33.146 --> 20:35.112
JAMAL: Y'all know
that's a tragedy,

20:35.114 --> 20:37.247
where they end up dying
at the end, right?

20:37.948 --> 20:39.148
Stop, boy.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.516
Hey, everyone.

20:40.518 --> 20:41.917
This is Ms. Jaworski.

20:41.919 --> 20:44.185
She is our notary
for the night.

20:44.187 --> 20:46.754
Hi. Who's ready to sign these
papers so we can get rich?

20:46.756 --> 20:49.089
Not until Andre and
Rhonda get here.

20:49.091 --> 20:52.425
Okay. Hey, why don't you
help yourself to the buffet

20:52.427 --> 20:55.127
while we wait?
Yes, sir.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.962
Well, this seems
like a good time.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.964
LUCIOUS:
A good time for what?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.465
Well, Hakeem and I
share some feelings...

21:00.467 --> 21:02.700
Oh they're sharing
feelings now, y'all.

21:02.702 --> 21:04.501
CAMILLA: ...is that
Hakeem's musical palette

21:04.503 --> 21:06.803
is limited for an artist
at his level.

21:06.805 --> 21:09.038
He should be expanding beyond
the simplistic rapping...

21:09.040 --> 21:10.606
Wait, wait.
Hold on, Miss Thing.

21:10.608 --> 21:12.441
He's a rapper.

21:12.443 --> 21:13.875
That's what he does.
He raps.

21:13.877 --> 21:16.177
Dad, just check her out.
Go ahead, baby.

21:16.179 --> 21:18.112
Like, in the beginning,
the Lucious Lyon sound

21:18.114 --> 21:19.613
drew on a variety
of influences.

21:19.615 --> 21:21.615
And Hakeem
has developed

21:21.617 --> 21:23.583
his own sound in the same way.

from Hakeem.

22:58.829 --> 23:00.962
He's doing amazing.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.463
Lucious, he's
gonna surprise you,

23:02.465 --> 23:04.198
because he's so much
deeper than you realize.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.067
Kehinde Wiley.
Yes, indeed.

23:07.069 --> 23:09.969
Be great if he did a portrait
of Hakeem, don't you think?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.738
(chuckles)
Come into my study.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.906
Thank you.

23:14.908 --> 23:17.141
So...

23:17.143 --> 23:20.244
you love my son,
don't you?

23:20.246 --> 23:21.578
Yes, very much.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.646
I need to know how much.

23:24.714 --> 23:27.716
Well, you can't
quantify it.

23:27.718 --> 23:30.218
If that's
what you're asking.

23:30.220 --> 23:33.487
I mean, you're not
here for nothing.

23:33.489 --> 23:36.056
And you had to know
showing up here,

23:36.058 --> 23:37.991
you were going to get
a reaction, right?

23:37.993 --> 23:40.059
And you been
around the block,

23:40.061 --> 23:43.028
and I'm not judging
just from your little accent.

23:43.030 --> 23:46.764
You knew showing up at my
house-- on this night--

23:46.766 --> 23:48.999
that's a big move.

23:49.001 --> 23:50.667
So how much?

23:52.036 --> 23:53.603
There's no amount of money...

23:53.605 --> 23:55.738
See?

23:55.740 --> 23:58.373
I wasn't even
thinking about money,

23:58.375 --> 24:00.007
but you sure were.

24:01.676 --> 24:02.909
(lock clicks)

24:02.911 --> 24:05.611
I didn't say you
were dismissed.

24:05.613 --> 24:08.513
You are not gonna
keep me in here.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.014
Sit down.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.918
Hakeem's been jumpy lately,

24:14.920 --> 24:16.753
but your name
keeps popping up.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.956
I need to know how much

24:19.958 --> 24:21.958
it will cost to make you...

24:21.960 --> 24:23.793
disappear.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.428
<i> Now</i> I'm talking money.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.263
There's no amount
of money, Lucious,

24:28.265 --> 24:30.265
that's gonna make me
go away from Hakeem.

24:30.267 --> 24:32.567
Do you understand?

24:32.569 --> 24:35.369
This is a big night
for me, Camilla.

24:35.371 --> 24:37.471
Pulling this IPO off
before I die

24:37.473 --> 24:40.040
and getting my family
where it's supposed to be.

24:40.042 --> 24:42.876
I have investigated your
financial situation.

24:42.878 --> 24:44.310
You are in debt

24:44.312 --> 24:45.644
up to your neck,

24:45.646 --> 24:48.313
your business
is underwater,

24:48.315 --> 24:51.983
you are selling your clothes
that you strut around in.

24:51.985 --> 24:54.986
I am going to offer you
a great deal of money

24:54.988 --> 24:58.488
to go as far away from my son
as humanly possible.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.992
You know how God
made man in his image?

25:02.994 --> 25:06.428
I'm making Hakeem in my image.

25:06.430 --> 25:09.063
God didn't
need no help,

25:09.065 --> 25:12.299
and neither do I.

25:16.470 --> 25:18.971
After all this, you're saying
you want to take Lola back?

25:18.973 --> 25:20.305
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

25:20.307 --> 25:21.839
Mm.
How is she?

25:21.841 --> 25:23.807
I do miss her.

25:35.152 --> 25:37.086
Oh, great.
Where's Andre?

25:37.088 --> 25:39.121
You might want to ask
your husband that, Cookie.

25:39.123 --> 25:41.356
I don't have
a husband, Rhonda.

25:44.660 --> 25:47.128
Hey, what are you doing here?

25:47.130 --> 25:50.197
I'm sorry to disturb your
evening, but Mr. Lyon called.

25:50.199 --> 25:52.265
He said he needed me.

25:52.267 --> 25:53.833
I better go.

25:57.170 --> 25:59.104
Juanita said
you had a bad dream.

25:59.106 --> 26:01.439
But fear not,

26:01.441 --> 26:03.841
because Uncle Hakeem
and I are here.

26:03.843 --> 26:05.542
You want us
to sing you a song?

26:05.544 --> 26:07.510
You think she'll like
"Drip Drop"?

26:07.512 --> 26:09.678
♪ Drip, drippity, drop ♪

26:09.680 --> 26:12.647
No, get away from her with all of that.
♪ Drip, drip, drippity, drop. ♪

26:12.649 --> 26:16.150
What? She'll like that. She ain't

26:16.152 --> 26:19.286
I wrote a song for my baby.

26:19.288 --> 26:21.388
We'll sing that.

You will take Ms. Marks
directly to JFK

27:31.244 --> 27:33.944
and put her on the very first
flight to London.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.578
One way.
Understood.

27:35.580 --> 27:38.414
Everything in your
apartment will be packed

27:38.416 --> 27:41.250
and shipped to that one-room
flat in Clerkenwell.

27:41.252 --> 27:43.418
This is the very
first installment.

27:43.420 --> 27:47.188
Once you are out
of my son's range,

27:47.190 --> 27:50.424
I will deposit the rest
into your bank account.

27:54.795 --> 27:56.595
I don't want your money.

27:56.597 --> 27:59.030
And as soon as I hear
that you're dead,

27:59.032 --> 28:01.799
I will take
the first flight back.

28:01.801 --> 28:04.434
Do you hear me?

28:09.306 --> 28:11.440
Ms. Marks, please, this way.
Don't touch me.

28:11.442 --> 28:13.308
He will forget you in a month.

28:13.310 --> 28:14.942
And in six months,
you'll be rotting

28:14.944 --> 28:16.443
in a wheelchair like a vegetable

28:16.445 --> 28:18.077
with a colostomy bag
trailing behind you.

28:18.079 --> 28:21.613
You are a disgusting,
despicable human being.

28:21.615 --> 28:24.482
And I wish you a miserable death
when you go to hell.

28:24.484 --> 28:26.317
Bon voyage.

28:27.385 --> 28:28.952
Finally, everybody's here.

28:28.954 --> 28:30.386
Let's sign these papers.

28:30.388 --> 28:32.388
Where's Andre?

28:32.390 --> 28:34.890
He didn't want to leave
the hospital, so I'm his proxy.

28:34.892 --> 28:37.592
Well, hold on, hold on.

28:37.594 --> 28:38.926
I'm not signing
over Andre's stock

28:38.928 --> 28:41.128
to some little
country club queen

28:41.130 --> 28:43.330
just because
his feelings are hurt.

28:43.332 --> 28:45.098
Look, you want to raise
your family's fortune, Rhonda,

28:45.100 --> 28:47.066
you're gonna have
to work for that.

28:47.068 --> 28:48.600
I've been with your son
for ten years,

28:48.602 --> 28:50.468
and you don't know
a damn thing about me.

28:50.470 --> 28:52.436
But just to clarify,

28:52.438 --> 28:54.805
I came from nothing.

28:54.807 --> 28:58.074
And I worked my ass off
to put myself through Penn.

28:58.076 --> 28:59.842
Nothing has ever
been handed to me,

28:59.844 --> 29:02.743
and I have never expected
anything to, either.

29:03.811 --> 29:06.012
Where do I sign?

29:09.116 --> 29:12.651
Okay, why does it say 750,000
shares and not a million?

29:12.653 --> 29:13.952
Well, that was before.

29:13.954 --> 29:15.753
And this is Common B shares,

29:15.755 --> 29:18.155
not the voting A shares
that he was promised.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.656
Really, Lucious?

29:19.658 --> 29:22.926
You gonna cheat Andre
on top of everything else?

29:22.928 --> 29:24.727
I'm not cheating anybody.
She don't even know

29:24.729 --> 29:26.962
what she's talking about.
RHONDA: Well, it looks like

29:26.964 --> 29:28.964
he reduced Hakeem
and Jamal's as well.

29:28.966 --> 29:31.766
What the hell is wrong
with you, Lucious?!

29:31.768 --> 29:34.101
I did it for you.

29:34.103 --> 29:36.436
I-I took shares from everyone,

29:36.438 --> 29:38.938
so I could give some
to you, Cookie.

29:42.475 --> 29:46.177
And how many shares did you
personally give up, Lucious?

29:48.547 --> 29:50.114
He stole from his sons

29:50.116 --> 29:51.882
to buy your loyalty.
That's what he did.

29:51.884 --> 29:53.917
"Stole"?

29:53.919 --> 29:55.718
This is all mine.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.453
I'm sharing

29:57.455 --> 29:59.388
my stock with you,
Oh, here we go. Okay.

29:59.390 --> 30:01.590
you ungrateful little grub.
You did it all alone.

30:01.592 --> 30:02.757
Yo, yo, wait, wait, wait.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.991
What's going on?

30:03.993 --> 30:05.692
"What's going on?"

30:06.593 --> 30:08.727
Where's Camilla?

30:08.729 --> 30:10.195
What up, fam?

30:12.264 --> 30:13.931
Let's get this party started.

30:13.933 --> 30:16.667
Uncle Vernon is here.

30:16.669 --> 30:18.835
I'm bringing some guests.

30:18.837 --> 30:20.736
Say hi to everybody.

30:40.455 --> 30:43.189

(chuckles)

31:39.131 --> 31:40.663
What's up with you, man?

31:40.665 --> 31:42.898
Why would you bring
these people into my house?

31:42.900 --> 31:44.633
What "people" are we
talking about? It's Olivia.

31:44.635 --> 31:46.034
That's Lola's mother, right?

31:46.036 --> 31:49.370
Lola, who is in your house.

31:49.372 --> 31:52.139
So... thought that was
the right thing to do.

31:52.141 --> 31:53.473
(sniffing)

31:53.475 --> 31:56.075
That's what I do, right?

31:56.077 --> 31:58.577
I always do the right thing.

31:58.579 --> 32:00.979
But what about dude in there--
Mr. Sketchy-- you know him?

32:00.981 --> 32:03.848
I don't know him. He's... You don't
know him, but he's in my house?

32:03.850 --> 32:05.416
No, but he's the one
that convinced her

32:05.418 --> 32:07.217
to come get her kid.

32:07.219 --> 32:08.851
So how bad could that be?

32:08.853 --> 32:10.752
And you brought him here.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.086
Yeah, but you know what?

32:12.088 --> 32:14.521
I can go find out
for sure who he is.

32:14.523 --> 32:16.589
No, hold on, hold on.
No, that's what I do for you.

32:16.591 --> 32:18.324
I got you, man. I got you. I got this
for you. No, no, no, no, man, no!

32:18.326 --> 32:20.025
No, dude. I got this, man!

32:20.027 --> 32:23.094
You done did enough.

32:23.096 --> 32:25.495
What's up with you?

32:27.664 --> 32:30.264
Look at you, man.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.033
You doing that thing again?

32:34.035 --> 32:35.501
Go home.

32:35.503 --> 32:37.836
Get yourself together.

32:42.741 --> 32:44.975
(door slams)

32:46.544 --> 32:49.245
Music's not gonna do it tonight.

32:49.247 --> 32:50.679
Your meds?

32:50.681 --> 32:52.746
Not helping, either.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.683
I think I know
something else that might.

33:00.420 --> 33:02.654
What?

33:12.464 --> 33:17.134
Sometimes music and medicine
isn't the best therapy.

33:17.136 --> 33:19.368
But...

33:21.604 --> 33:23.804
...you know what is?

33:26.574 --> 33:28.875
This might be against
hospital rules.

33:32.812 --> 33:34.612
Pray with me.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.150
I don't pray.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.885
Why won't you just
give it a try?

33:41.887 --> 33:43.620
What have you
got to lose?

33:43.622 --> 33:46.356
Why don't you pray for me?

33:58.235 --> 34:01.036
Dear God...

34:02.905 --> 34:06.407
So, Reg, how do
you know Vernon?

34:06.409 --> 34:08.308
We just met.

34:08.310 --> 34:09.776
Mm.

34:09.778 --> 34:11.410
And Olivia?

34:13.179 --> 34:14.646
We go way back.

34:14.648 --> 34:16.014
Oh.

34:16.016 --> 34:18.149
Dad, you seen Camilla?

34:18.151 --> 34:20.084
I can't find her nowhere.

34:20.086 --> 34:21.819
Well, stop looking for her--
she's gone.

34:21.821 --> 34:23.453
She left with Malcolm.

34:23.455 --> 34:24.487
With Malcolm?

34:24.489 --> 34:25.521
Where?

34:25.523 --> 34:27.956
At the airport.

34:27.958 --> 34:29.924
Or on the plane by now.

34:29.926 --> 34:31.926
I asked her how much money
it would cost

34:31.928 --> 34:33.527
to make her
walk away from you

34:33.529 --> 34:35.462
and stop playing
with your mind.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.629
Did she take your money?

34:36.631 --> 34:39.298
What do you think?

34:39.300 --> 34:41.767
COOKIE: (whistles)
Dude, those some crazy tats.

34:41.769 --> 34:42.768
(chuckles)

34:42.770 --> 34:44.102
Let me see what you into.

34:44.104 --> 34:45.103
What's that?

34:45.105 --> 34:46.504
A bird, a demon?

34:46.506 --> 34:47.771
What is that?

34:47.773 --> 34:49.639
It's a crow.

34:49.641 --> 34:51.340
Crows eat dead people.

34:51.342 --> 34:53.275
And dead animals.

34:53.277 --> 34:54.476
That's what you into?

34:54.478 --> 34:55.710
REG:
Nah, not particularly.

34:55.712 --> 34:56.811
No, don't, don't...

34:56.813 --> 34:59.280
Just joking.

34:59.282 --> 35:01.515
Scary Bird.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.150
Lola has nightmares
about birds.

35:04.152 --> 35:05.784
Is that him?

35:08.154 --> 35:09.921
Olivia, does
he hurt her?

35:12.658 --> 35:14.558
(whispers):
Help me.

35:16.027 --> 35:17.460
I'm gonna go get Lola.

35:17.462 --> 35:18.694
No.

35:18.696 --> 35:20.062
You the one
she's scared of.

35:20.064 --> 35:21.663
I should kick
your ass.

35:21.665 --> 35:22.664
OLIVIA: Put the gun down, Reggie!
Oh, my God.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.032
Reggie, put it down!

35:24.034 --> 35:25.166
I should have smoked
your ass...

35:25.168 --> 35:26.700
What the hell is going on?!

35:26.702 --> 35:28.334
Hold on a second! Hold on!
No! Dude, don't...

35:28.336 --> 35:30.035
Everybody, shut up!

35:30.037 --> 35:33.071
You need to leave right now.
Shut up, shut up!

35:33.073 --> 35:34.172
Just calm down, dude.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.373
Trying to take what mine.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.741
Olivia's my lady.

35:38.009 --> 35:40.143
You put a ring on it,
put a baby in her.

35:40.145 --> 35:44.646
Reg, Jamal was my husband
before you were my man.

35:44.648 --> 35:46.047
No, see, y'all got
all the money,

35:46.049 --> 35:47.314
you think you can do
whatever you want, right?

35:47.316 --> 35:49.749
Man, that's it?
You want some money?

35:49.751 --> 35:51.517
Ain't a problem
when you in this family, man.

35:51.519 --> 35:52.918
You-you want some diamonds?

35:52.920 --> 35:55.754
Here, take this watch.

35:55.756 --> 35:57.489
$30,000. No, it ain't
about no watch.

35:57.491 --> 35:59.424
See, you took her from me
Would you shut the hell up,

35:59.426 --> 36:00.925
the moment you put the baby...
and just tell me what you want.

36:00.927 --> 36:03.327
What I want... is to
kill your ass. No!

36:03.329 --> 36:05.262
Do it. Do it. Do it!
No, no, no, no!

36:05.264 --> 36:06.663
Don't! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

36:06.665 --> 36:08.197
Stop! It was me!

36:08.199 --> 36:09.832
It was me!

36:09.834 --> 36:12.201
I'm the father.

36:18.974 --> 36:21.008
I put the baby in her, not him.

36:21.776 --> 36:24.010
I did it.

36:28.948 --> 36:30.515
It was me.

36:30.517 --> 36:32.383
I'm the father
of the baby.

36:33.651 --> 36:35.051
Shoot me!

36:35.053 --> 36:37.119
Is that true?

36:42.225 --> 36:45.126
Hey, hey, hey, no!
No! Stop! Stop!

36:45.128 --> 36:46.360
No! Stop!

36:46.362 --> 36:48.328
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

36:48.330 --> 36:49.896
Dude, I done came clean.

36:49.898 --> 36:52.198
It's me.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.067
I'm the one that promised her
that if she married Jamal,

36:55.069 --> 36:56.935
I was gonna make
her a star.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.371
I'm the one

37:00.373 --> 37:01.538
that got her pregnant.

37:01.540 --> 37:03.006
She was lonely.

37:03.008 --> 37:05.475
Jamal wouldn't
touch her.

37:05.477 --> 37:07.243
I took advantage.

37:07.245 --> 37:09.178
I'm the bad man.

37:09.180 --> 37:11.480
If you kill me,

37:11.482 --> 37:13.081
everyone in this room
would applaud.

37:13.083 --> 37:15.016
You see the little
pretty blonde there?

37:15.018 --> 37:17.051
She hates me.

37:17.053 --> 37:20.354
My son... wants me dead

37:20.356 --> 37:23.824
because I saved him
from a con artist.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.693
But the worst
thing that I did--

37:26.695 --> 37:29.529
I let the mother
of my children rot in jail

37:29.531 --> 37:32.598
for 17 years.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.433
So trust me, Reg,

37:34.435 --> 37:38.236
if you shoot me, you would be
everybody's personal hero.

37:39.338 --> 37:41.372
Shoot me right here.

37:41.374 --> 37:43.040
Let her go.

37:43.042 --> 37:45.008
Be the hero.

37:45.010 --> 37:46.209
Just let her go.

37:46.211 --> 37:47.543
Nah, man,
don't come any closer!

37:47.545 --> 37:49.511
Would you just let her go?!
(gunshot)

37:49.513 --> 37:51.045
(Cookie screams)

37:51.047 --> 37:52.012
Oh, my God.

37:52.014 --> 37:54.214
Everybody, away.
Get back.

37:54.216 --> 37:56.349
Get back. Move.

37:56.351 --> 37:57.550
Are you all right?

37:57.552 --> 37:59.418
I thought I lost you.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.987
I wish he would
have shot you.

38:02.888 --> 38:05.255
HAKEEM:
He dead?

38:07.625 --> 38:09.626
Come on, I got you.

38:09.628 --> 38:12.261
All right, let's
get some air.

38:12.263 --> 38:13.861
I got you.

38:16.731 --> 38:18.732
LUCIOUS:
What you looking at, huh?

38:18.734 --> 38:20.633
I saved your ass.

38:20.635 --> 38:23.869
(police sirens approaching)

38:33.579 --> 38:36.047
You the one that left--
no word, no nothing.

38:36.049 --> 38:39.083
Jamal, I left because
you were so horribly unhappy.

38:39.085 --> 38:40.951
You hated pretending
to love me.

38:40.953 --> 38:43.820
I was never gonna be
in your life again,

38:43.822 --> 38:46.322
but I had to get
Lola away from Reg.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.124
And I had nowhere
else to go.

38:49.126 --> 38:50.825
And you could
be her daddy.

38:52.928 --> 38:54.461
Probably not.

38:54.463 --> 38:55.695
Hey.

38:56.630 --> 38:58.230
It's okay.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.467
But I knew you would
take care of her.

39:02.469 --> 39:04.802
Because you're kind.

39:05.937 --> 39:08.772
Reg said he was gonna
kill me and Lola

39:08.774 --> 39:10.774
before he'd let us go.

39:10.776 --> 39:13.977
I was running away to my cousins
in Florida when he found me.

39:13.979 --> 39:16.079
And I never meant
to hurt any of you.

39:16.081 --> 39:17.480
I swear I didn't.

39:17.482 --> 39:18.914
I swear I am so sorry.

39:18.916 --> 39:19.981
COOKIE:
It's all right.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.683
You left your baby to save her.

39:22.685 --> 39:24.518
There's nothing harder
than that.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.520
And now that he's
gone, I'm gonna be

39:26.522 --> 39:28.622
the best mother
I can be.

39:28.624 --> 39:30.390
I promise I will.

39:31.258 --> 39:32.858
Come here, babe.

39:37.029 --> 39:39.130

Say bye to everybody, hmm?

39:39.132 --> 39:40.531
RHONDA:
Bye, sweetheart.

39:40.533 --> 39:42.366
Bye, Rhonda.

39:42.368 --> 39:44.334
You come back and visit
whenever you want, okay?

39:44.336 --> 39:46.102
Okay.
(chuckles)

39:48.872 --> 39:51.106
Don't be sad.

39:55.510 --> 39:57.143
Don't be mad.

39:57.145 --> 40:01.146
How could I be mad
at my Lola-bear?

40:01.148 --> 40:02.847
You gonna be good?

40:04.316 --> 40:06.150
Mm.

40:06.152 --> 40:07.284
Good-bye, baby girl.

40:07.286 --> 40:08.318
Bye.
Mm.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.719
Mm.

40:09.721 --> 40:11.620
You be good to your mom, okay?

40:11.622 --> 40:13.121
LOLA: Okay. COOKIE: So
that when you grow up,

40:13.123 --> 40:14.622
you can be just
as strong as her.

40:14.624 --> 40:15.656
Okay?
LOLA: Okay.

40:15.658 --> 40:16.857
(Cookie kisses her)

40:19.060 --> 40:20.193

40:20.195 --> 40:22.061
Can I still sing
the Lyon song?

40:22.063 --> 40:24.063
'Cause I'm still
a Lyon, right?

40:24.065 --> 40:25.497
(chuckles)

40:25.499 --> 40:27.465
You'll always
be a Lyon.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.300
So you won't get scared.

40:31.135 --> 40:33.269
I won't be scared.

40:38.140 --> 40:40.541
Oh, let me help you with this.

40:41.376 --> 40:43.810
Girl, I missed you.

40:52.084 --> 40:54.317
MAN:
This way, ma'am.

41:01.658 --> 41:03.925
COOKIE:
<i> You wanted to see me?</i>

41:06.828 --> 41:08.862
You know, Cookie,
there was a lot I wanted

41:08.864 --> 41:10.230
to say to you last night

41:10.232 --> 41:12.332
that I didn't get
a chance to say to you.

41:12.334 --> 41:13.733
Yeah, well, after
last night,

41:13.735 --> 41:15.701
you might want to
leave a lot unsaid.

41:15.703 --> 41:18.670
No, no, I realized last night

41:18.672 --> 41:21.272
that I don't ever want to be
in that position again

41:21.274 --> 41:23.073
that I could lose you.

41:23.075 --> 41:27.376
I don't know how much time
I got left in this world, but...

41:27.378 --> 41:31.379
I got 18,000 square feet.

41:31.381 --> 41:32.947
I'll share it with you.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.281
(chuckles softly)

41:34.283 --> 41:35.915
18 thou...
(sighs)

41:35.917 --> 41:38.517
Are you asking me to move
in with you, Lucious?

41:38.519 --> 41:42.254
No, I'm asking you
to be my one again.

41:42.256 --> 41:44.723
I mean, we conceived
all of this.

41:44.725 --> 41:47.092
You and me.

41:47.094 --> 41:50.228
We built this together,
we fought for this,

41:50.230 --> 41:52.630
we-we defended this.

41:52.632 --> 41:55.132
You know, when I first
got out of prison,

41:55.134 --> 41:57.601
I had a stupid fantasy about
us getting back together.

41:57.603 --> 41:59.102
So stupid.

41:59.104 --> 42:01.104
So I made mistakes.

42:01.106 --> 42:02.705
And?

42:03.907 --> 42:06.108
I'll spend the rest
of my life fixing them.

42:06.110 --> 42:08.643
Lucious,

42:08.645 --> 42:11.345
you don't care about
nothing but yourself.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.482
Everything you
touch, you destroy.

42:15.484 --> 42:18.117
Look at what you
did to my sons.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.420
I can do better, Cookie.

42:22.422 --> 42:24.121
And in the end,
you're gonna understand

42:24.123 --> 42:25.489
the choices I've made.

42:25.491 --> 42:28.425
I promise you,
I can do better. I...

42:28.427 --> 42:31.394
You just don't
want to die alone.

42:45.775 --> 42:47.242
It all looks good.
All right.

42:47.244 --> 42:49.277
This is all
the same info, really.

42:49.279 --> 42:50.778
Mm-hmm.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.246
Nothing...
Right.

42:52.248 --> 42:54.081
There's nothing really
different in here.

42:54.083 --> 42:56.083
Malcolm, excuse me. I need
to talk to you for a minute.

42:56.085 --> 42:57.551
Okay, give me a second.
Mm-hmm.

43:01.488 --> 43:04.189
Um, I got your
message. You okay?

43:04.191 --> 43:06.991
Y-You're not having any
PTSD reactions, are...?

43:06.993 --> 43:10.194
Take me somewhere
with you, Malcolm.

43:10.196 --> 43:13.130
I want to be alone
with you.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.931
Okay, let's do that.

43:14.933 --> 43:18.434
