00:43.871 --> 00:45.769
Listen.

00:45.804 --> 00:49.428
This is how it'’s gonna go.

00:49.463 --> 00:51.568
You disappear.

00:51.603 --> 00:53.915
You can'’t say goodbye.

00:53.950 --> 00:57.540
Can'’t tell anyone
you'’re leaving.

00:57.574 --> 01:00.232
I'’ll set you up
with a new life,

01:00.267 --> 01:02.855
give you everything
you could need to start over.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.685
Understand?

01:07.412 --> 01:09.828
I relocate people.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.554
It'’s like witness protection,

01:11.588 --> 01:14.488
but without
the marshal service.

01:14.522 --> 01:16.524
I'’m not a violent man.

01:16.559 --> 01:18.837
I don'’t even carry a gun.

01:20.149 --> 01:22.012
If everything goes
according to plan,

01:22.047 --> 01:24.705
there'll be no
need for violence.

01:24.739 --> 01:27.052
I don'’t do violence.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.123
You have to agree
to these terms,

01:29.158 --> 01:31.194
or I can'’t protect you.

01:31.229 --> 01:34.094
You understand the danger
you'’re in, right?

01:37.856 --> 01:40.617
It'’s always the same thing.

01:40.652 --> 01:42.205
Someone saw something,

01:42.240 --> 01:45.035
someone did something
they shouldn'’t have.

01:46.761 --> 01:50.627
I don'’t know what you saw,
and I don'’t care.

01:50.662 --> 01:53.182
Ramos has given you
a way out.

01:53.216 --> 01:57.047
If you don'’t take it,
or you decide to come back,

01:57.082 --> 01:59.809
well, you know
what the alternative is.

02:01.155 --> 02:04.054
He doesn'’t care
if you live or die.

02:04.089 --> 02:07.265
You'’re just
a small complication.

02:07.299 --> 02:09.094
But once you'’re with me,

02:09.128 --> 02:12.270
I make sure that
you make it out safely,

02:12.304 --> 02:14.479
that you'’re protected.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.105
My partner Jackson
will be on lookout.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.179
He'’ll make sure everything
goes smoothly from a distance.

02:25.214 --> 02:28.907
I trust him with my life.

02:28.941 --> 02:32.876
Our documents guy will meet us
at the handoff.

02:32.911 --> 02:38.227
Passport, birth certificate,
license, credit cards.

02:38.261 --> 02:43.232
Everything you need to start
over in a nice little package.

02:43.266 --> 02:47.201
I'’ve been doing this
a long time.

02:47.236 --> 02:52.620
Most people don'’t get
a second chance at a new life.

02:52.655 --> 02:55.727
You'’re a lucky man.

03:04.632 --> 03:06.324
Come on, man.

03:06.358 --> 03:08.878
You'’re supposed to be
waiting here, you know that.

03:08.912 --> 03:10.293
You'’re making me look bad.

03:10.328 --> 03:11.674
Yeah, I, um, uh...

03:11.708 --> 03:14.055
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Same old story. Come on.

03:18.267 --> 03:21.822
- This everything?
- Yeah, yeah. It'’s all in there.

03:21.856 --> 03:23.030
Good.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.138
Okay, thank you.
That'’s... a lot.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.466
They'’re here.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.278
All right.

04:04.313 --> 04:07.005
That'’s the rendezvous.
You know the drill.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.835
Hand him off, and he'’s not
your problem anymore.

04:12.666 --> 04:14.219
Enjoy Mexico.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.876
Thank you for this.

04:15.910 --> 04:17.911
Don'’t eat the worm.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.852
- Oh, man, that was rough.
- Yeah?

04:26.887 --> 04:29.027
- He cried the whole way here.
- Aw...

04:42.247 --> 04:44.111
Why do I have
the worst car here?

04:44.145 --> 04:45.802
Jimmy, I don'’t have
an answer for that.

04:45.837 --> 04:47.010
I just gave you 10,000 cash.

04:47.045 --> 04:48.667
Why don'’t you buy a new one?

04:48.702 --> 04:52.464
You know, if you--
I was looking at my schedule,

04:52.499 --> 04:54.742
and if you have anything
lined up for--

04:54.777 --> 04:57.055
Are you kidding me?

04:57.089 --> 04:59.368
- I just paid you, man.
- Yup, yup.

04:59.402 --> 05:00.817
I just gave you money.

05:00.852 --> 05:03.303
He'’s not even over the border,
all right?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.788
I'’ll let you know
if anything'’s coming up.

05:05.822 --> 05:08.342
Just try to make it last
this time, okay?

05:08.377 --> 05:10.965
- Stay off eBay.
- Yeah, they'’re collectibles.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.967
Nobody needs that many
collectables, Jimmy.

05:13.002 --> 05:15.798
- Cool, okay.
- I'’ll give you a call.

05:15.832 --> 05:17.351
We'’ll play Xbox or something,
all right?

05:17.386 --> 05:18.801
Okay.

07:35.731 --> 07:37.284
Nest.

07:37.318 --> 07:38.423
Kick. Cage.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.944
Fifteen across.
The bird has flown the...

07:43.186 --> 07:44.429
Coop.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.017
Cup?

07:46.051 --> 07:47.881
Nest.

07:47.915 --> 07:52.437
Eighteen across.
A knight'’s weapon.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.761
I heard you got
a guy in the Valley.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.834
I do.

08:09.868 --> 08:11.939
Step out the car, man.

08:11.974 --> 08:16.047
Who do you think you are,
you punk?

08:16.081 --> 08:18.394
D'’Angelo wants to holla at you.

08:18.428 --> 08:22.122
Well, then D'’Angelo can come
and talk to me himself.

08:22.156 --> 08:24.296
I ain'’t gonna ask again,
old man.

08:27.334 --> 08:28.749
Come on.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.722
Easy, man.

08:38.863 --> 08:41.244
- What now?
- Get in.

08:42.659 --> 08:46.077
Well, hurry up, man!
I ain'’t got all damn day!

09:47.932 --> 09:49.140
Hola, tio.

09:49.174 --> 09:51.729
Over here at D'’Angelo's place.

09:51.763 --> 09:53.040
Okay.

09:53.075 --> 09:55.836
The one that works for him?

09:55.871 --> 09:57.873
- Victor?
- Yeah.

09:57.907 --> 10:02.567
He just took Jackson for
a little chat with D'’Angelo.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.362
Are you sure it was Brady?

10:04.396 --> 10:08.262
Sí. You want me
to put someone on him?

10:10.161 --> 10:15.235
No. No, I'’ll take care of it.
Thanks, Hector.

10:40.778 --> 10:44.229
So, Mr. Brady,

10:44.264 --> 10:47.129
gonna tell me
how this operation works?

10:59.175 --> 11:02.696
My partner and I provide
a very special service.

11:02.731 --> 11:04.284
If you need someone gone,

11:04.318 --> 11:06.458
but you'’ve got too much heat
to be dropping bodies,

11:06.493 --> 11:10.117
we'’ll get them to the border
and give them a new identity.

11:10.152 --> 11:13.500
If I ask you
to hide a person for me,

11:13.534 --> 11:16.123
how do I know you ain'’t
gonna sell '’em out?

11:16.158 --> 11:18.712
We don'’t do smash-and-grabs.

11:18.747 --> 11:21.370
We don'’t do hits.

11:21.404 --> 11:24.476
We protect them
to their destination.

11:24.511 --> 11:28.308
Anything after that,
it'’s your problem.

12:48.181 --> 12:49.976
Hey, man.
I have a new job.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.806
One of my relocators had a chat with D'’Angelo behind my back.

12:52.841 --> 12:54.256
Find out what it'’s about.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.741
If they want someone vanished,
I need to know.

13:29.153 --> 13:30.602
Well, that was fun.

13:30.637 --> 13:32.950
- Pleasure doing business.
- Yeah.

15:03.626 --> 15:04.938
Jesus.

15:09.494 --> 15:10.771
Shit.

15:10.806 --> 15:13.878
Police. I think
someone'’s been shot.

15:15.431 --> 15:18.538
Hey! What the fuck
are you guys doing?

15:18.572 --> 15:20.229
Shut the fuck up
and pop the trunk!

15:20.264 --> 15:21.368
What?

15:21.403 --> 15:23.681
Pop the trunk!

15:23.715 --> 15:26.580
Fuck. This isn'’t
how we do things.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.030
Fuck.

17:52.243 --> 17:53.555
Yeah.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.386
Hey!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.908
What the fuck?

18:39.497 --> 18:41.879
Let me outta here, asshole!

18:41.913 --> 18:44.847
I know you hear me,
you cocksucker.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.509
Hey!

18:52.717 --> 18:55.617
I know you can hear me!

18:55.651 --> 18:57.757
This is all
a big misunderstanding.

18:57.791 --> 19:00.967
Just open up the trunk
so we can have a talk.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.982
Are you listening?

19:24.232 --> 19:27.649
I'’m tied up,
for Christ'’s sake.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.962
Open up, motherfucker!

19:30.997 --> 19:32.412
Hey!

19:32.447 --> 19:34.690
Where are we going?

21:48.859 --> 21:49.894
Get out.

21:56.211 --> 21:58.040
Walk.

22:00.146 --> 22:01.527
Walk.

22:07.429 --> 22:08.879
Open it.

22:10.087 --> 22:11.330
Move.

22:18.095 --> 22:20.028
Stop. Stop it!

22:20.062 --> 22:22.133
Stop! Stop it!

22:22.168 --> 22:26.310
I don'’t want to hurt you,
so don'’t make me.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.839
Keep going.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.088
Stop.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.612
Turn around.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.346
Have a seat.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.645
Wait.

23:26.784 --> 23:28.476
You'’re just gonna
leave me here?

23:28.510 --> 23:30.719
I'’ll be right back.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.997
I need to talk to somebody.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.464
Yeah.

23:51.499 --> 23:53.535
Who was it?

23:53.570 --> 23:55.157
Who gave you the job, Jacks?

23:55.192 --> 23:57.884
I don'’t know what to tell you.
It was some new guy.

23:57.919 --> 24:00.853
Same county as Ramos'’ bunch.

24:00.887 --> 24:03.165
I thought you'’d appreciate
the extra work.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.652
Do both of us a favor.
Don'’t do any more thinking.

24:06.686 --> 24:08.688
Hey, kid, come on.

24:08.723 --> 24:10.172
Come on, nothing!

24:10.207 --> 24:12.209
We had a good thing going
with Ramos, man.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.591
You fucked it up.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.213
What do you mean,
fucked it up?

24:16.247 --> 24:19.181
What do I mean?
You almost got me killed.

24:20.389 --> 24:22.253
I wanted to protect people,
okay?

24:22.288 --> 24:24.152
I didn'’t want
to become a criminal.

24:24.186 --> 24:27.362
- You'’re not a criminal.
- No?

24:27.396 --> 24:29.468
Then why is there a girl
that I just kidnapped

24:29.502 --> 24:32.125
handcuffed to a chair
in the next room?

24:32.160 --> 24:34.956
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:34.990 --> 24:38.200
You fucking heard me!
What am I supposed to do now?

24:38.235 --> 24:39.478
Were you seen?

24:39.512 --> 24:42.066
I don'’t know. Probably.

24:42.101 --> 24:45.069
Oh, Jesus, kid. The cops are
gonna be hot on your ass now.

24:47.451 --> 24:51.420
Look, you can'’t
keep her there long.

24:51.455 --> 24:53.733
You keep hold of that gun, kid.

25:00.188 --> 25:02.328
You'’re gonna need it.

25:05.607 --> 25:08.541
Yeah, well, I'’m sorry, kid.

25:08.576 --> 25:10.509
I, uh...

25:10.543 --> 25:13.581
I really hoped
it wouldn'’t come to this.

25:13.615 --> 25:15.652
No.

25:15.686 --> 25:18.482
No, no, no, no, no.

25:20.553 --> 25:23.556
I can'’t do that.
I promised I wouldn'’t.

25:23.591 --> 25:27.111
Sometimes there are promises
you just can'’t keep.

25:27.146 --> 25:30.252
You can'’t just drive around
with her in your trunk.

25:30.287 --> 25:32.841
I don'’t see any other way.

25:35.706 --> 25:38.537
I got into this to save lives.

25:40.297 --> 25:45.405
At some point, every man
has to make the hard choice.

25:47.476 --> 25:51.342
All that matters is what you do
with the time you'’re given.

25:51.377 --> 25:53.517
Look, you'’ve done
your best, kid.

25:55.139 --> 25:59.799
Look, I don'’t know
whether or not I can save her,

25:59.834 --> 26:02.181
but I'’m not gonna kill her.

26:33.212 --> 26:35.697
What are you guys doing
on my land?

26:35.732 --> 26:37.975
Can'’t you fuckers read?

26:38.010 --> 26:42.946
Ramos wants a word
with you, Brady.

26:42.980 --> 26:45.880
Thinks you'’re
playin'’ him, homes.

26:48.572 --> 26:51.506
For your sake, ese,
I hope that'’s not true.

27:18.809 --> 27:21.294
Here we go.

27:33.237 --> 27:34.238
Sorry.

27:38.139 --> 27:39.968
Why are you doing this?

27:40.003 --> 27:42.177
I didn'’t know
what they had planned.

27:42.212 --> 27:44.593
I have nothing to do with
whatever happened in that house.

27:44.628 --> 27:47.666
That'’s between you
and the people that hired me.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.150
So who are you?

27:52.463 --> 27:54.327
If a person
wants to disappear

27:54.362 --> 27:57.123
without the help
of the government,

27:57.158 --> 27:59.298
I make that happen.

28:00.782 --> 28:02.577
I don'’t understand.

28:02.611 --> 28:04.372
I find them a new life

28:04.406 --> 28:07.616
in a place where nobody
will ever find them.

28:07.651 --> 28:09.101
So you'’re a trafficker.

28:09.135 --> 28:11.931
No. No, no, no.
I'’m helping people.

28:11.966 --> 28:15.452
It'’s like, uh,
witness relocation.

28:15.486 --> 28:17.592
Look.

28:17.626 --> 28:19.594
The way I see it,

28:19.628 --> 28:22.493
you and I are stuck
in this thing together.

28:22.528 --> 28:25.082
Thing I can'’t figure out is
why somebody would kidnap you

28:25.117 --> 28:28.776
and then pay good money
to have you protected.

28:28.810 --> 28:31.468
Does it really matter?

28:31.502 --> 28:34.367
I guess not. The cops are gonna
be on me either way now.

28:37.163 --> 28:42.134
All right, look.
Here'’s what I'm gonna do.

28:42.168 --> 28:46.552
I'’m gonna uncuff you,
but before I do that,

28:46.586 --> 28:50.142
I need to know
that you'’re not gonna run.

28:50.176 --> 28:54.387
The only reason
that you are alive right now

28:54.422 --> 28:56.631
is because I'’m gonna
make you disappear.

28:56.665 --> 28:57.494
I understand.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.704
If you run, I can'’t protect you.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.395
Okay.

29:41.572 --> 29:42.677
You hungry?

29:50.650 --> 29:53.032
Have a seat.

29:53.067 --> 29:54.482
Amigo.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.074
What the fuck'’s this all about?

30:00.108 --> 30:02.559
I'’m very disappointed in you.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.905
Why? What have I--

30:03.940 --> 30:06.459
Have you ever not felt welcome
in my restaurant?

30:06.494 --> 30:08.116
No.

30:08.151 --> 30:09.980
I'’ve had you in my home.

30:10.015 --> 30:13.604
You were invited
to my nephew'’s wedding.

30:13.639 --> 30:15.572
My main concern...

30:15.606 --> 30:18.092
is my family'’s happiness
and safety.

30:18.126 --> 30:23.752
Every time I could'’ve killed
a witness or paid them off,

30:23.787 --> 30:27.239
I took a risk and paid you
to take care of that for me.

30:27.273 --> 30:29.172
Is that not true?

30:29.206 --> 30:30.518
Yes, but it was--

30:30.552 --> 30:31.795
Ehh, ehh!

30:31.830 --> 30:37.283
Yet you disrespect me
and work for that asshole?

30:37.318 --> 30:40.114
Do you know who D'’Angelo is?

30:40.148 --> 30:42.979
Do you know what he does?

30:43.013 --> 30:44.601
He'’s a pusher, isn't he?

30:44.635 --> 30:46.327
He uses kids, man.

30:46.361 --> 30:48.916
They'’re 15,
16-year-old boys.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.022
And they'’re slanging shit
at the grocery store

30:52.057 --> 30:53.748
till two in the morning.

30:55.543 --> 30:59.202
Maybe a month ago,
I went up that way,

30:59.236 --> 31:01.652
and I saw Hector'’s boy.

31:01.687 --> 31:04.448
He rode up to D'’Angelo's guys

31:04.483 --> 31:07.175
and had pockets like this!

31:07.210 --> 31:09.660
He pulled out
a bag full of crack!

31:09.695 --> 31:13.388
Red caps are fifty.
Blues, a hundred.

31:13.423 --> 31:17.806
He'’s my fucking nephew,
and he'’s this little!

31:19.739 --> 31:22.777
I'’ve always liked you, Jackson.
Kyle too.

31:22.811 --> 31:24.641
But I can'’t have you
involved with him.

31:24.675 --> 31:28.162
It'’s not good for my business
or my family.

31:28.196 --> 31:32.407
Mr. Ramos,
you know why we do this.

31:32.442 --> 31:35.686
We would never, never do it
to help D'’Angelo.

31:36.998 --> 31:39.759
So you'’d help Briggs then.

31:42.693 --> 31:46.387
Here, take one of these.
Take two.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.044
D'’Angelo works for Briggs.

31:48.078 --> 31:50.943
And if you think D'’Angelo
is a bad man,

31:50.978 --> 31:53.256
you have no idea.

31:53.290 --> 31:55.396
Look, we only did it
to help the girl.

31:55.430 --> 31:57.053
Well, you made a mistake, bro.

31:57.087 --> 32:01.540
That girl,
she'’s not a witness.

32:01.574 --> 32:03.645
- Who the fuck--
- Shh!

32:03.680 --> 32:06.717
I want you to listen to me
very hard, homes.

32:06.752 --> 32:10.963
When my people told me
that you had been at his place,

32:10.998 --> 32:13.207
they thought you were
going behind my back,

32:13.241 --> 32:16.037
making me look like a fool.

32:16.072 --> 32:19.385
And, ese, they were right.

32:21.215 --> 32:23.079
Why are you telling me this?

32:23.113 --> 32:24.873
See, what I did,

32:24.908 --> 32:28.153
I called in The Florist to
find out what you were up to,

32:28.187 --> 32:32.536
only to discover that D'’Angelo
hired you to take the girl.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.716
She was never supposed
to be relocated.

32:41.269 --> 32:42.926
What'’s that?

32:42.961 --> 32:47.103
Motels. Albuquerque.

32:47.137 --> 32:48.725
Okay.

32:48.759 --> 32:52.694
Now The Florist knows
the girl'’s with Kyle,

32:52.729 --> 32:55.594
and you don'’t wanna mess
with The Florist.

32:55.628 --> 32:58.907
He has a special talent
for making problems disappear

32:58.942 --> 33:00.668
permanently.

33:00.702 --> 33:04.016
He knows they'’re holed up in a motel somewhere in Albuquerque,

33:04.051 --> 33:05.845
and he'’s gonna find them,

33:05.880 --> 33:09.332
and he'’s not gonna stop till
he cleans up your mess for me.

33:09.366 --> 33:12.335
The Florist doesn'’t stop
for no one, not even me.

33:12.369 --> 33:16.995
Once he'’s on the scent,
he'’s a mad dog with a bone.

33:17.029 --> 33:20.653
I'’m gonna give you a chance
to save the kid.

33:20.688 --> 33:24.036
Is there some way
you could get ahold of Kyle?

33:24.071 --> 33:25.969
- We don'’t--
- Shh.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.522
Tell me the motels he uses.

33:27.557 --> 33:29.869
I'’ll send my boys
to pick him up,

33:29.904 --> 33:32.389
otherwise he'’ll have
to deal with The Florist.

33:32.424 --> 33:33.977
You know where he is.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.911
If I did, you know Kyle'’s not
gonna give up that girl

33:36.945 --> 33:38.050
for anything.

33:38.085 --> 33:41.364
Well, if he gives her up,
I'’ll let him go.

33:41.398 --> 33:45.264
But if he'’s there
protecting her

33:45.299 --> 33:48.060
when The Florist gets there,

33:48.095 --> 33:49.682
he'’s dead.

34:13.706 --> 34:16.536
So do you enjoy what you do?

34:19.264 --> 34:22.025
It has purpose.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.751
A janitor has purpose.

34:23.784 --> 34:25.786
You think he enjoys
scrubbing porcelain?

34:28.652 --> 34:30.792
So do you enjoy it?

34:35.003 --> 34:36.108
Used to.

34:36.143 --> 34:39.732
You don'’t anymore,
but you still do it.

34:42.149 --> 34:44.909
I made a promise to somebody.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.396
Right.

34:52.469 --> 34:54.126
Excuse me.
Can we get the check?

34:54.161 --> 34:56.024
Sure, hon.
I'’ll bring that right out.

34:56.059 --> 34:57.474
Thank you.

34:58.889 --> 35:02.272
Excuse me.
I need to use the bathroom.

35:02.307 --> 35:04.723
Oh, uh, just so you know,

35:04.757 --> 35:07.070
there'’s no windows in there.

35:17.977 --> 35:19.565
Oh! Sorry.

35:52.529 --> 35:54.807
Hey. Did you hear
what happened?

35:54.842 --> 35:56.844
You'’re damaged goods.

35:56.878 --> 35:58.742
But if you can make it
to Briggs,

35:58.777 --> 36:01.159
the job'’s still yours.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.126
All right. Got it.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.454
Thank you.

36:39.093 --> 36:40.163
Hmm.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.614
You like baseball?

36:44.719 --> 36:47.066
I don'’t know.
It'’s okay, I guess.

36:47.101 --> 36:48.723
What do you mean,
you don'’t know? It's baseball.

36:48.758 --> 36:50.622
You either love it
or you hate it.

36:50.656 --> 36:52.969
What is this?

36:53.003 --> 36:58.077
That is the last baseball game
I ever went to with my dad.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.184
Oh.

37:02.979 --> 37:03.911
I'’m sorry.

37:05.775 --> 37:08.191
- Is this him?
- No. That'’s, uh...

37:08.226 --> 37:10.435
That'’s his best friend.

37:10.469 --> 37:13.161
I still remember this game.

37:13.196 --> 37:15.612
Jim Rice hit two home runs.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.995
- That must have been amazing.
- Yeah, it was.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.997
Could hear the second hit
from the west coast, man.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.344
He sailed it right over
the south wall.

37:23.379 --> 37:25.691
And my dad turns to me,
and he says,

37:25.726 --> 37:28.453
"I'’m gonna go get you
that bat."

37:29.661 --> 37:32.871
Did he get it?

37:32.905 --> 37:34.528
Oh, yeah.

37:34.562 --> 37:36.495
He got it signed.

37:38.601 --> 37:41.604
Think that'’s the proudest
I ever saw him.

38:14.084 --> 38:17.122
You sure you should be
smoking that?

38:18.813 --> 38:20.194
Are you sure I shouldn'’t?

38:20.228 --> 38:23.059
I mean, Jesus Christ,
I already got cancer.

38:23.093 --> 38:27.753
Jackson, why'’d you
get me out here?

38:33.103 --> 38:37.729
Paul, you ever heard tell
of a guy called The Florist?

38:39.109 --> 38:42.527
Not a whole lot,
if I'’m honest.

38:48.912 --> 38:50.673
Just that he'’s bad news.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.475
As soon as he'’s
on a man'’s trail,

38:59.509 --> 39:01.649
he ain'’t gonna quit.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.381
When he dies,
he'’s going straight to hell,

39:09.416 --> 39:12.591
and the devil'’s gonna want
no part of it.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.743
How'’s it going, sir?
How can I help you?

39:26.778 --> 39:28.607
Oh, just the gas.

39:31.576 --> 39:33.923
So, uh, long way?

39:36.891 --> 39:39.273
What'’s that?

39:39.307 --> 39:41.240
You don'’t seem local.

39:45.486 --> 39:47.661
How do you know that?

39:47.695 --> 39:50.388
I-It...
Strangers kinda stick out.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.768
I changed my mind.

39:51.803 --> 39:53.701
Bone handle.

39:53.736 --> 39:55.669
Bone handle.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.361
Cherry red.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.983
Cherry red.

40:00.846 --> 40:02.607
Cherry red.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.658
His is a new kind of violence
for the modern world.

40:19.693 --> 40:22.040
Ain'’t no way to stop him.

40:28.391 --> 40:31.221
Is this something
I should know about?

40:34.362 --> 40:36.261
No.

40:36.295 --> 40:40.368
I definitely surely say
it isn'’t.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.474
Jackson.

40:42.509 --> 40:47.306
Whatever this is,
you wanna drop it and walk away.

40:53.002 --> 40:56.730
This ain'’t a fight
you can afford to lose.

40:56.764 --> 41:00.216
I'’ve already lost. The only
thing I'’m worried about now

41:00.250 --> 41:03.322
is what'’s coming for the boy.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.148
Kyle, it'’s game show night,
man.

42:10.182 --> 42:12.115
Like once a week, you know?

42:12.150 --> 42:15.291
I know, Jimmy.
This is important.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.430
What'’s up?

42:16.464 --> 42:19.502
How quickly can you meet me
in Durango?

42:19.537 --> 42:20.779
Oh, God.

42:20.814 --> 42:23.920
Uh, like three hours or so?

42:23.955 --> 42:26.026
Um, what do you need?

42:26.060 --> 42:27.372
Two full plans.

42:27.406 --> 42:29.098
Guy and a girl.

42:29.132 --> 42:32.515
Oh! Two, like
a couple'’s retreat?

42:32.550 --> 42:33.861
That'’s nice.

42:33.896 --> 42:37.278
No, Jimmy,
not like a couple'’s retreat.

42:37.313 --> 42:39.557
This is for me.

42:39.591 --> 42:42.594
Full by what country'’s
standards?

42:42.629 --> 42:43.837
Argentina.

42:44.872 --> 42:48.324
Uh, like Argentina-Argentina?

42:48.358 --> 42:50.671
- That kind of Argentina.
- God!

42:50.706 --> 42:54.606
Uh, come on, Kyle.
Oh, God.

42:54.641 --> 42:56.815
Um, okay.

42:56.850 --> 43:01.268
Gonna need plates, passports,
birth certificates, the works.

43:01.302 --> 43:03.891
That'’s gonna be tight, man.

43:03.926 --> 43:06.169
That'’s gonna be real tight.

43:08.655 --> 43:09.794
How long do you need?

43:09.828 --> 43:13.280
I need like a day or two.

43:13.314 --> 43:15.247
All the same,
meet me in Durango.

43:15.282 --> 43:17.871
I'’ll give you the particulars.

43:17.905 --> 43:21.150
Okay. Okay, um, I will.

43:21.184 --> 43:23.566
I will meet you there.

43:23.601 --> 43:24.809
Uh...

43:26.638 --> 43:29.020
Like for reals, for reals, yeah?

43:29.054 --> 43:31.539
Yeah, for reals, for reals.

43:33.645 --> 43:35.785
I will make this happen.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.097
Don'’t be late.

43:56.392 --> 44:00.154
Well, good evening, sir.
What can I do you for?

44:06.471 --> 44:08.404
Have you seen this car?

44:11.441 --> 44:15.169
Well, I can'’t say
as I remember it though.

44:15.204 --> 44:18.414
We get hundreds of cars here
every month.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.174
- I mean, I can'’t...
- Is that right?

44:20.209 --> 44:24.213
Expect me to remember
every one of '’em?

44:24.247 --> 44:27.630
It'’s very important
that I find this man.

44:29.321 --> 44:31.116
I'’m sorry I can't be
of more assistance,

44:31.151 --> 44:33.291
but I honestly wouldn'’t know.

44:40.194 --> 44:42.472
Would you mind
if I borrowed this pencil

44:42.507 --> 44:45.234
if I promise to bring it
right back?

44:45.268 --> 44:47.443
Well, by all means.

44:47.477 --> 44:50.653
Got plenty more.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.311
I appreciate that.

44:56.279 --> 44:58.419
You have a good night.

44:59.317 --> 45:01.112
Thank you for your visit, sir.

45:01.146 --> 45:02.423
And remember,
you'’re always welcome.

46:44.560 --> 46:49.151
Uh, could I put you on hold
for just a moment?

46:49.185 --> 46:52.602
A guest actually
is just arriving.

46:52.637 --> 46:54.294
All right.

46:54.328 --> 46:57.124
All right, Ma.
Thank you.

46:57.159 --> 46:59.609
Good evening, sir.
How may I assist you?

46:59.644 --> 47:01.784
I just need a room
for the night.

47:01.819 --> 47:02.854
Single?

47:02.889 --> 47:04.580
Yeah, that'’s fine.

47:04.614 --> 47:08.480
You don'’t need to pay
until you'’re leaving, sir.

47:08.515 --> 47:11.759
It'’s okay. I like to come
and go as I please.

47:14.797 --> 47:17.524
Alrighty then.

47:17.558 --> 47:20.527
Here you go.
That'’s room, uh, room 210.

47:20.561 --> 47:22.563
Thank you.

47:22.598 --> 47:25.497
Oh, hey, if anybody
comes asking for me,

47:25.532 --> 47:28.811
just tell '’em I already left.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.088
Alrighty.

48:03.811 --> 48:08.092
Yeah, hello?
I think he'’s here, man.

48:08.126 --> 48:09.887
The guy you'’re looking for.

48:09.921 --> 48:13.373
Letterman jacket,
driving a white Dodge.

48:13.407 --> 48:15.237
That'’s him, right?

48:16.755 --> 48:19.827
Oh, wait, there'’s
a girl with him too.

48:19.862 --> 48:21.243
Thin, long brown hair.

48:21.277 --> 48:24.246
I put '’em in room 210,
up the stairs.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.110
We'’ll be there soon.

48:27.870 --> 48:30.217
He'’s there, homes.
The girl too.

48:30.252 --> 48:31.667
That'’s good, ¿que no?

48:31.701 --> 48:33.945
All we gotta do now
is pick her up.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.843
That'’s right, homes.

48:35.878 --> 48:38.087
I don'’t want to bump into
that psycho, The Florist.

48:38.122 --> 48:42.920
If we figured this out already,
he ain'’t too far behind.

48:45.784 --> 48:46.889
Come on.

49:09.325 --> 49:11.465
What are you looking for?

49:21.372 --> 49:24.237
Gotta go take care
of a couple things.

49:27.274 --> 49:29.414
Need to meet a guy.

49:30.622 --> 49:32.245
I need to know
I'’m not gonna come back

49:32.279 --> 49:33.798
and have you not be here.

49:47.260 --> 49:48.778
Thanks.

50:07.004 --> 50:11.525
Surname "Jankowski."

50:45.249 --> 50:48.769
Your new given name is...

50:48.804 --> 50:50.357
"Natasha."

50:54.051 --> 50:55.604
Nationality?

50:57.123 --> 50:58.917
Latvia.

51:32.261 --> 51:34.125
Room 210.

51:34.160 --> 51:36.093
Should be upstairs.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.861
Remember, you see Braddock
or he gets in the way,

51:45.895 --> 51:48.312
hurt him if you have to,
but don'’t kill him, ese.

51:48.346 --> 51:50.072
OÓrale.

52:14.372 --> 52:15.856
Hector!

52:28.352 --> 52:29.318
On three.

52:29.353 --> 52:30.630
Shit.

52:43.367 --> 52:44.954
Fuck!

52:48.751 --> 52:51.616
He ain'’t here.
Get the girl.

52:59.383 --> 53:01.005
Kyle, stop!

54:03.240 --> 54:06.208
Come on, let'’s go!
Go, go, go! Gotta go!

54:16.253 --> 54:17.495
Get in.

54:38.205 --> 54:39.276
What the fuck?

54:39.310 --> 54:40.898
Get down.

54:41.968 --> 54:43.141
Drive!

54:44.660 --> 54:46.938
Who the fuck is that?

55:33.330 --> 55:34.710
Shh!

55:40.337 --> 55:41.993
Do you have the girl?

55:42.028 --> 55:45.065
I assume these dead guys
belong to you.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.688
Fuck!

55:46.722 --> 55:48.621
Nah. They'’re gone.

55:48.655 --> 55:50.070
Deal with them later.

55:50.105 --> 55:51.762
Willie Briggs
is your next target.

55:51.796 --> 55:55.662
Who is Willie Briggs,
Mr. Ramos?

55:55.697 --> 55:57.975
The girl was supposed
to take care of him.

55:58.009 --> 56:00.391
Now he'’s yours.
I'’ll double the take.

56:00.426 --> 56:01.358
Done.

56:05.362 --> 56:06.639
Okay, then.

56:10.470 --> 56:12.610
Things can change.

56:49.198 --> 56:51.373
I'’m guessing that wasn't
supposed to happen?

56:53.617 --> 56:54.825
Not exactly.

56:54.859 --> 56:57.414
You know those guys?

56:57.448 --> 57:01.141
Yeah, I know '’em.
I knew '’em.

57:01.176 --> 57:02.246
So who are they?

57:02.280 --> 57:05.318
They'’re like...

57:05.352 --> 57:06.871
associates.

57:06.906 --> 57:08.701
We used to freelance
with them.

57:08.735 --> 57:10.599
Who are you?

57:10.634 --> 57:14.051
Right now I'’m the guy
that'’s saving your ass.

57:14.085 --> 57:15.880
You'’re doing a great job.

57:15.915 --> 57:18.987
Can we get the fuck outta here?

57:28.445 --> 57:30.377
I-I need that.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.421
No.

57:41.216 --> 57:43.977
No, I don'’t think you do.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.987
Need you to go inside
and book a room.

57:54.022 --> 57:56.438
Under any specific name?

57:56.473 --> 57:58.647
Barry Banson.

57:58.682 --> 58:00.131
Who'’s Barry Banson?

58:00.166 --> 58:03.169
There is no Barry Banson.
That'’s the point.

58:38.307 --> 58:41.483
Hey, baby, let me show you
what a good time feels like.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.864
All right, leave her alone.

58:42.898 --> 58:44.313
You wanna be
the little bitch?

58:44.348 --> 58:47.040
Come on, you gonna show me
a good time, right?

58:47.075 --> 58:49.215
I said leave her alone.

59:38.575 --> 59:39.610
Fuck!

59:42.889 --> 59:44.373
Fuck.

59:55.108 --> 59:58.836
It was never supposed
to be like this.

59:58.871 --> 01:00:01.218
I know.

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:03.461
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.538
Let me sew you up?

01:00:21.134 --> 01:00:25.622
When I was a boy,
my father was murdered.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.454
He owed people some money.

01:00:31.317 --> 01:00:33.940
My sister saw it go down.

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:36.356
She...

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.465
They killed her.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.159
Yeah.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:53.166
That'’s why I do what I do.

01:00:56.031 --> 01:00:58.758
Tried to avoid violence.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:01.002
Ten years of my life.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:04.799
I always told myself
I'’d do the right thing.

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:08.803
You did the only thing
that you could.

01:01:08.837 --> 01:01:11.081
Yeah, that'’s the problem.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.257
You'’re a good man, Kyle.

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:59.336
Excuse me, sugar,
could I trouble you--

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.372
Could I get an iced tea,
a cold iced tea?

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:05.376
Maybe a couple satchels of
low-calorie sweetener in that?

01:02:05.411 --> 01:02:07.896
- You got it.
- Thank you, darlin'’.

01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:10.554
Hi. May I help you
with something?

01:02:15.283 --> 01:02:16.940
It'’s inevitable.

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:19.252
Excuse me?

01:02:19.287 --> 01:02:21.496
Number four down.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.154
I believe the word you'’re
looking for is "inevitable."

01:02:28.814 --> 01:02:31.471
Huh. So it is.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:33.888
Thank you, darlin'’.

01:02:33.922 --> 01:02:35.061
You'’re welcome.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.069
Uh, look, Mister...

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:45.451
Smith.

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:47.867
Smith.

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:52.838
Well, Mr. Smith,
not to seem rude,

01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:55.150
but do I know you?

01:02:55.185 --> 01:02:57.049
You don'’t, but that's okay.

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.429
The only thing that
really matters right now

01:02:58.464 --> 01:03:00.190
is that I know you, Jackson.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.298
How do you know my name?

01:03:07.197 --> 01:03:08.750
Also unimportant.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.166
- How do you know my name?
- What is important...

01:03:11.201 --> 01:03:12.581
is the tragedy that happened

01:03:12.616 --> 01:03:15.170
at the motel up the road
last night.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.213
That'’s terrible.

01:03:23.247 --> 01:03:27.424
Whole thing is
goddamned terrible.

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:30.082
Why are you showing me this?

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:35.535
Why are you showing me that?

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:37.779
Mm.

01:03:47.547 --> 01:03:48.548
Well?

01:03:51.897 --> 01:03:53.519
If I were you, Mr. Brady,

01:03:53.553 --> 01:03:57.040
I would be far more concerned
with Kyle'’s new passenger,

01:03:57.074 --> 01:03:58.973
if I were you.

01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:00.802
I'’m just a...

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.874
interested third party though.

01:04:03.909 --> 01:04:05.427
Nothing more.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.234
Mmm.

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:38.184
Goodbye, Mr. Brady.

01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:14.763
Jesus!

01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:18.526
Couldn'’t you knock?

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.701
Put some clothes on, kid.
Meet me outside.

01:06:21.736 --> 01:06:23.531
Who is that?

01:06:23.565 --> 01:06:26.361
That'’s Jackson.

01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:30.503
Oh.

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:12.062
You must be
Mr. Willie Briggs.

01:07:12.097 --> 01:07:13.684
What'’s this about, Jacks?
We got the girl,

01:07:13.719 --> 01:07:15.928
we got the money,
nobody knows where we are.

01:07:15.962 --> 01:07:17.585
What else do you want?

01:07:22.866 --> 01:07:24.799
Ah! Fuck!

01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:27.974
What happened to staying
unattached, huh?

01:07:28.009 --> 01:07:30.391
I'’m getting out, Jacks.

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:33.359
Getting out?
What the hell does that mean?

01:07:33.394 --> 01:07:34.740
That means I'’m done, okay?

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:36.673
I don'’t need this shit anymore.

01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:38.330
Just '’cause you
had to get bloody one day?

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:42.196
No, because I finally found
someone who I give a damn about.

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.853
Maybe I want that
to be my life.

01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:49.272
Oh, Jesus Christ!
One pretty girl shows up,

01:07:49.306 --> 01:07:54.173
and suddenly you'’re a goddamned
pussy-whipped teenager.

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:56.348
Fuck you, Jackson.

01:07:59.247 --> 01:08:01.698
Hey.

01:08:01.732 --> 01:08:03.286
You'’re being duped, kid.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.323
What do you mean, duped?
Who'’s duping me?

01:08:06.358 --> 01:08:08.118
She'’s not
who you think she is.

01:08:08.153 --> 01:08:10.189
Oh, yeah?
Who is she then?

01:08:10.224 --> 01:08:11.742
She'’s a hired killer.

01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:14.193
Ramos wanted her
to take out Briggs.

01:08:14.228 --> 01:08:17.609
I know you want to save her,
but she'’s a lost cause, kid.

01:08:17.645 --> 01:08:19.992
She'’s chosen her lot in life.

01:08:20.026 --> 01:08:21.993
If you'’re not gonna
let this go,

01:08:22.028 --> 01:08:24.169
well, there'’s a gun
in my truck.

01:08:24.203 --> 01:08:26.309
You'’re wasting your time.

01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:28.518
But go if you have to.

01:08:30.346 --> 01:08:31.831
Operator.

01:08:31.866 --> 01:08:35.421
I'’m making a collect call
to 505-555-3781.

01:08:35.456 --> 01:08:36.421
Stand by, caller.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:39.977
Bueno.

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.703
I got away from Kyle.

01:08:41.738 --> 01:08:43.359
I'’m on my way
to take care of Briggs.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:44.844
Too late, you bitch!

01:08:44.879 --> 01:08:46.639
You fucked up
when you killed my nephew.

01:08:46.674 --> 01:08:48.227
I didn'’t kill anyone.

01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:50.160
Kyle couldn'’t hurt a fly!
I know it was you!

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:51.644
I found someone else
to do Briggs,

01:08:51.679 --> 01:08:53.267
and you'’re next on his list!

01:08:53.301 --> 01:08:57.719
Fuck you, Ramos! I am finishing
this job, and you will pay me.

01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:14.357
Fuck!

01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.435
Operator.

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:28.129
I'’m making a collect call
to 505-555-3071.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.475
Yeah?

01:09:30.511 --> 01:09:32.926
I need a gun and a ride,
Central and Second.

01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:08.204
Get your fucking hand
off my jacket.

01:11:37.707 --> 01:11:40.226
What are you doing here?

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:42.228
What are you doing here?

01:11:42.263 --> 01:11:44.852
Please don'’t make this
difficult.

01:11:44.886 --> 01:11:48.407
I'’m not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

01:11:48.442 --> 01:11:50.961
This is a job, Kyle,
like any other.

01:11:50.996 --> 01:11:54.896
I get paid to show up,
and I do it.

01:11:54.931 --> 01:11:57.554
Hey, hey!
This is what you do, huh?

01:11:57.589 --> 01:12:00.281
You fucking kill people
for money?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.351
Get off me.

01:12:01.386 --> 01:12:02.904
Jesus Christ.

01:13:12.111 --> 01:13:13.043
Fuck!

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.523
Ready to go?

01:14:53.558 --> 01:14:57.113
You got the keys to mine?
I gotta go see Ramos.

01:14:58.286 --> 01:15:00.323
Look, it'’s not gonna
do any good.

01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:03.222
I'’m not going there
to have a conversation.

01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:06.812
Kyle.

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:14.337
Be careful.

01:15:14.371 --> 01:15:15.890
You too.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.127
What is this place?

01:15:46.162 --> 01:15:47.577
Don'’t worry.

01:15:47.612 --> 01:15:51.305
Kyle'’s father kept this place
as a safe house.

01:15:56.137 --> 01:15:59.451
Kyle, he'’s different.

01:15:59.485 --> 01:16:01.764
Kyle likes to see
the good in everyone,

01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:03.938
even when it'’s not really there.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.019
Have a seat.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.045
Now, you just sit there and
relax and take it easy, okay?

01:16:44.254 --> 01:16:46.671
Besides, you young folks
need the rest

01:16:46.705 --> 01:16:49.570
more than us old-timers do.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.158
I'’ll be right back.

01:17:40.138 --> 01:17:42.312
Why are you here, homes?

01:17:42.347 --> 01:17:45.108
You here to scare me, ese?

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.111
