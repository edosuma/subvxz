But Flash, I thought
the League was barred
from Bwunda.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I called in
the Justice League,

-You?
-Of course.

LIA:
<i>I didn't want to do it.</i>

06:14.908 --> 06:17.744

over my actions,

06:17.778 --> 06:19.100
over my own mind.

You're among friends.

06:24.483 --> 06:27.000
Will you let us help you?

06:29.754 --> 06:33.894
M'gann's intel warned
about a BIF attack
on the entire delegation.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.463
But I'm pretty sure
Garth was targeted.

06:36.495 --> 06:38.665
They drugged him
so he couldn't use his powers,

06:38.697 --> 06:40.600
then moved in for the kill.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.302
Ambassador Troia
was also targeted.

06:43.302 --> 06:44.603
BEAST BOY: And Lex is good.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.199
But he seemed almost
prepped and ready

06:46.199 --> 06:49.543
to call in the League
and slam the Outsiders.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.511

Perhaps it's not my place.

07:07.826 --> 07:09.795
<i>How will you learn
if you don't ask?</i>

07:09.829 --> 07:13.665
All right, the Atlantean
and Thymisceran survived,
did we fail?

07:13.699 --> 07:18.000
<i>Well, it would've been
nice to eliminate
my main UN adversaries,</i>

07:18.000 --> 07:20.774
<i>but defaming the Outsiders
was job one.</i>

07:20.807 --> 07:24.000
<i>That's why the Light
planted seeds on the darknet</i>

07:40.793 --> 07:43.000
She'll tell them
it was a set up.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.798
<i>She cannot confirm
my involvement.</i>

07:45.831 --> 07:49.036
Respectfully, sir, they'll
know you were involved.

07:49.036 --> 07:54.300

are two very different things.</i>

07:58.011 --> 07:59.745

08:14.995 --> 08:16.663
You were nearly beheaded,

08:16.696 --> 08:18.564
I doubt you could
heal from that.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.935
Besides, you still haven't
said a word about your arrest.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.336
You can talk to me,

08:23.370 --> 08:26.105
you can talk to Artemis,
you can talk to Helga.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.875
But you have
to talk to someone.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.678
Until you do and until I know
what's going on with you,

08:33.711 --> 08:35.711
you're benched from the Team.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.918
I saw you on television, <i>hijo.</i>

we were going to do?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
That's the problem.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.696
I understood intellectually.

08:49.729 --> 08:52.331
But seeing it live
was very different.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.000
Your friend was injured.

You don't,
what if you're hurt?

08:59.806 --> 09:01.606
You can't walk away so easily.

09:01.639 --> 09:02.807
Watch me.

09:02.807 --> 09:04.100
You didn't even
have to be there.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.745

Violet's upstairs and Fred
went out to look for Vic.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.500
Gosh, I forgot about Vic.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.409
Even when I'm here,
I never see him.

10:10.442 --> 10:13.980
I live here
and I never see him.

10:14.014 --> 10:19.014
Violet, I just ended
another call with my mentor.

give us a moment.

Of course.

Violet, please, you've been

10:49.350 --> 10:51.817
Maybe I'm not
a very good girlfriend.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.322
Violet does have her issues.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.759
Still, this is your

they rarely last.

for the Erdel Initiative,

11:32.024 --> 11:33.994
and the Justice League
Zeta-tubes.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.427
He hacked their access

11:35.461 --> 11:38.000
and they zeta'd through
the LA WayneTech tube.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.032
We did.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.033
Because the three of us
compared notes

11:41.033 --> 11:45.272
and agreed we needed
to talk to the Outsiders.

11:45.303 --> 11:49.774
Guys, look,
one of Professor Ivo's
robot monkeys and this girl.

11:49.807 --> 11:51.476
She's reaching out
to us for help.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.947
It's exactly what I
hoped would happen.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.048
Check her profile.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.149
-Wait.
-BEAST BOY: Got it.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.451

11:58.451 --> 11:59.951
She lives in Dublin, Ireland.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.388

12:03.154 --> 12:06.100

12:06.100 --> 12:09.096
No, none of you kids
are going anywhere.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.029
Not till we hash
this thing out.

12:11.029 --> 12:14.567
Um, see, Jay,
I really respect you.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.235
But the fact is,
I'm an emancipated minor

12:17.269 --> 12:19.839
and Jaime and Virgil
are both 18.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.576
But Eduardo, Cassandra
and Bartholomew

12:22.610 --> 12:25.200

our permission to go.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.480

-Mom!

12:51.299 --> 12:52.870

12:52.870 --> 12:54.408
But she's gone.

12:54.408 --> 12:57.144
I've called all her muckers
and no one's seen her.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.479
Did you call the police?

12:58.510 --> 13:01.000
Aye, but I bollocksed it up

13:01.000 --> 13:03.317
by telling them about them
bloody monkeys.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.051
They wouldn't believe me.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.485
We will.

13:07.488 --> 13:08.989
All this showboating,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.990
can't you find other ways
to get attention?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.091
We aren't doing this
for ourselves.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.961

-No.
-Then talk to me.

"It's not you, it's me."

13:42.100 --> 13:44.299
But it is me. I...

13:45.625 --> 13:48.061
I kissed a girl at school.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.995
Well, she kissed me,
but I didn't stop her.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.567
Do you have feelings

But you don't know the reason
she was abducted.
