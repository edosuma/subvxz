00:02.680 --> 00:06.719
<i>There's a certain time eve</i> ry <i>morning,</i>
<i>after the bedpans have been emptied,</i>

00:06.800 --> 00:11.032
<i>that a calm washes over the place</i>
<i>and you can't help but feel peaceful.</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:15.398
Holy Vishnu. We've been working together
a while. Could you not whistle at me?

00:15.480 --> 00:18.472
You're right, we have been
working together for a while.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.348
I wouldn't know how long unless
I consulted my Friends for Life calendar

00:22.440 --> 00:24.192
that I keep in my hope chest.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.555
<i>I make Dr Cox's rants work for me.</i>

00:26.640 --> 00:29.108
<i>I catch up on paperwork,</i>
<i>I look after patients.</i>

00:29.200 --> 00:31.998
- Can you check on Mrs Ship?
- You got it, Bambi.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.799
<i>I take care of official things</i>
<i>that have to get done.</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:37.269
- You're a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.432
Long story short there, Molly,
I will always whistle at you

00:40.520 --> 00:45.389
like you're a blond with big bombs and
I'm a construction worker out of prison.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.550
- Is that clear?
- Crystal.

00:47.640 --> 00:52.236
I'm applying for a fellowship. I could
really use a letter of recommendation.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.756
Instead of using a girl's name,
could you refer to me as Dr Dorian?

00:55.840 --> 00:57.796
It sounds more professional.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.350
Frankly, each time you call me
a girl's name, I die a little inside.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.389
Look, Janis, Denise,
Tiffani-Amber Thiessen.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.439
Let me share something with you
that I like to call Perry's Perspective.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.034
One, if someone in front of me
at the coffee shop

01:13.120 --> 01:17.238
can't decide what they want in half an
hour, I should be allowed to kill them.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.232
Two, I'm fairly sure
if they took porn off the Internet,

01:20.320 --> 01:23.630
there'd only be one website left
called Bring Back The Porn.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.679
Three, and most importantly, the only
way to be respected as a doctor,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.479
nay, respected as a man,
is to be an island.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.994
You are born alone,
you damn sure die alone.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.991
Isn't that right, Spike?

01:35.080 --> 01:39.631
The point is, and you might wanna jot
this down, only the weak need help.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.756
I should get that tattooed on my neck.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.956
Good afternoon, Sacred Heart.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.077
Your chief of medicine
just said good afternoon, people.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.230
Good afternoon.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.788
<i>Dr Jeffrey Steadman,</i>
<i>world-class suck-up,</i>

01:51.880 --> 01:55.156
<i>especially since the residency director</i>
<i>position opened up.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:58.232
- Dr Cox, you know Dr Steadman.
- You're a doctor?

01:58.320 --> 02:01.915
All this time I thought that you were
some kind of parasitic creature

02:02.000 --> 02:05.436
who lived shoulder-deep
inside Big Bob's colon.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.354
- If only, sir.
- Well, I'm off to fluid rounds.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.351
To fluid rounds.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.236
In the new dolphin show,
Sean does this impression of a blowfish

02:17.320 --> 02:20.312
that will totally crack you guys up.
Show them.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.757
What the hell? That's not funny.
All he did was this.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.438
You're not doing it right.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.511
<i>It's never fun being the fifth wheel,</i>

02:31.600 --> 02:34.751
<i>especially when one of those wheels</i>
<i>is Elliot's boyfriend.</i>

02:34.840 --> 02:37.308
<i>I had decided to take the high road.</i>

02:37.400 --> 02:39.994
Is this regular?
I asked you to order me a diet.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.150
That is diet.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.798
I don't understand.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.838
I'm so careful about what I eat.
I keep putting on weight.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.639
It's all the regular soda, Sean.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.190
Enjoy.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.473
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:15.480 --> 03:17.357
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow

03:17.440 --> 03:20.591
to study the fishing industry's
impact on Maui dolphins.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.514
They're endangered and could actually
be wiped off the face of the earth.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.189
Fascinating stuff, Sean.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.431
I used to date that girl.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.556
<i>Hello, boys.</i>

03:35.640 --> 03:39.519
Hi, I'm Elliot.
So, you guys used to date?

03:39.600 --> 03:45.118
- Nice to see you, Sean.
- You too, Mary... An... ge... Elizabeth.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.477
<i>Goodbye, boys.</i>

03:49.560 --> 03:51.994
It's always aw <i>kw</i> ard
when you run into an ex.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.516
- Don't know how JD and Elliot do it.
- Do what?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.750
<i>I've gotta stop this. Kick him.</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:03.519
You OK, baby? How they have sex every
year and still manage to stay friends.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.752
We actually hadn't had a chance to talk
about that yet. But thank you.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.558
We want to do stuff to you.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.837
<i>Crap, the Janitor.</i>
<i>And he's with Sloppy Joe Guy.</i>

04:16.920 --> 04:19.559
<i>Distract them</i>
<i>before they do what they planned.</i>

04:19.640 --> 04:22.438
- We were thinking...
- I've got a riddle for you.

04:22.520 --> 04:26.718
- This isn't how you said it would go.
- Troy. We're listening.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.758
Two coins add up to 30 cents
and one of them is not a nickel.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.913
- So what are they?
- It's a riddle. You figure it out.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.914
Troy, get your hat.
We're going to the bank.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.194
Post-op diagnosis: Acute cholecystitis.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.955
Estimated blood loss: 150cc and...

05:03.760 --> 05:08.038
Patient transferred to recovery room
awake and stable. Hey, baby.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.075
- Notice anything different?
- Your tongue went countercloc <i>kw</i> ise?

05:14.800 --> 05:18.156
Green scrubs. I'm covering
for one of the surgical nurses.

05:18.240 --> 05:23.030
We could use the extra cash, plus we get
to work side by side for two days.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.953
- Isn't that great?
- So great.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.636
JD and I slept together.
It's not that big a deal.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.633
Be <i>tty</i> from work, how would you feel
if I told you we slept together?

05:36.720 --> 05:39.280
I'd be disturbed,
because Be <i>tty</i> is a harp seal.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.670
But a harp seal who's smart,
funny, and totally gets me.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.194
Is anyone in more hell
than me right now?

05:46.280 --> 05:49.078
Dude, we're going to the caff
so I can tell all the boys

05:49.160 --> 05:51.879
about my date
with Strangely Attractive Intern.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.552
You in?

05:53.640 --> 05:56.234
I think Turk
is a little more mature than that.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.437
She's right. But, honey,
what I think you're missing here

05:59.520 --> 06:04.116
is that not only is she attractive,
but she's strangely attractive.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.591
Guys, I can't go.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.155
"I'll miss you" high-five.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.918
Isn't that a coincidence?
Thank you for coming by.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.390
I'm sure we're gonna be in touch
with you real soon.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.031
Our nanny just walked out the door.
She has great credentials.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.634
She's got great, huge,
perky credentials.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.915
She's out. Besides, she's too expensive.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.358
About that, I've been thinking about
going after that residency director job.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.476
Residency director?

06:39.560 --> 06:43.314
But if you did that, you'd be taking
a positive step in your life.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.836
- I know.
- Quick, first place we made love?

06:46.920 --> 06:49.434
Give me a break.
We've never "made love".

06:49.520 --> 06:52.432
It is you. I'm so proud I could poo.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.479
Seriously, it's great. And it's
a board decision, so I can help you out.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.788
- No.
- Yes.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.075
I'm serious. I don't believe in it.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.438
I'd make you swear on a Bible,
but holy stuff makes your skin sizzle.

07:04.520 --> 07:07.637
- So just promise me.
- Fine. No help.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.631
Great.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.154
- Holy cow.
- You're hired.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.390
I cannot believe you're still angry.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.110
I'm not angry. Die.
Rot in hell.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.473
- I got it.
- Yes, JD and I work together.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.473
But it's not like we're crazy close.
It's not like we have inside jokes.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.755
We definitely don't do this.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.034
<i>Good evening, Elliot.</i>
<i>This is your Great Aunt Sally.</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:49.588
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- I have to get that.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.274
<i>Guess you're at Sean's.</i>
<i>Good thing we're so close</i>

07:52.360 --> 07:54.669
<i>or I couldn't impersonate</i>
<i>your Aunt Sally.</i>

07:54.760 --> 07:58.753
<i>By the way, I ran into Eye Patch this</i>
<i>morning. Said to tell you "honka honka."</i>

08:00.640 --> 08:04.679
It's just an inside... joke.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.271
Doctors.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.473
Come on. Two coins.
30 cents. No nickels.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.791
Come on. You can do this.
You went to Harvard, for God's sake.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.155
Relax. I figured it out.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.790
You gave me a penny

08:28.880 --> 08:32.190
and what appears to be a button

08:32.280 --> 08:34.635
on which you've written "29 cents".

08:36.480 --> 08:39.039
- Can't we just kill him?
- No.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.472
That's what he wants us to do.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.559
Just a real nice helmet there, princess.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.029
Actually, it's not a helmet.
It's a hair-met.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.556
It has extra room
so you don't mess up your hairdo.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.155
Fair enough. I'm gonna write you
a prescription for two testicles.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.435
Get this filled out whenever you want.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.637
But right now I'm going after
that residency-director gig

09:05.720 --> 09:08.792
and you're joining me
for a board-member meet-and-greet.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.269
Will you write my recommendation?
Goodbye.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.158
Give me a break,
I'll write what you want. We gotta go.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.118
Fine. Let me just fix my hair. Wait.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.352
- I don't have to.
- Good God.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.714
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel what?

09:30.800 --> 09:32.711
Scalpel, please.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.554
Here you go, baby.
Sorry. Dr Baby.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.915
Shall we proceed, Dr Baby?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.753
You know, papi,
this guy looks a lot like your waxer.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.559
- The Todd says, what now?
- Nothing.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.950
She meant her waxer cos...
We're working, guys.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.191
- No, I wanna hear this.
- It's no big deal.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.113
I make Turk wax his chest
so he doesn't give me a rash.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.194
Does she also make you wax your vagina?

09:59.640 --> 10:01.870
Sterile high-five.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.389
Are you even gonna talk to me?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.550
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you I slept
with JD. That was a mistake.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.359
We do talk all the time
and have inside jokes.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.716
He met my Great Aunt Sally
and my demented great uncle,

10:17.800 --> 10:21.759
who wears an eye patch and goes
"honka honka" when he poops.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.674
And now you hate me.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.673
I don't hate you.
I'm not even that mad at you.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.513
- You're not?
- No.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.395
How do I explain this?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.313
You know when you have
bad news to give to someone,

10:40.400 --> 10:44.234
you try to make them look bad by
blowing a small thing out of proportion?

10:44.320 --> 10:49.189
Totally. I'm so glad
it has nothing to do with us.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.913
The trip that I'm leaving on tomorrow,
it's a lot longer than I let on.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.753
What, like three days?

10:58.840 --> 11:01.400
- No.
- Four days?

11:01.480 --> 11:04.233
- Six months.
- Five days?

11:11.240 --> 11:14.118
- Love your hair-met.
- Love yours.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.991
<i>It was amazing to see how much</i>
<i>Dr Cox actually wanted this job,</i>

11:18.080 --> 11:20.719
<i>and how much he was willing</i>
<i>to put up with to get it.</i>

11:20.800 --> 11:24.270
The wife and I ended up buying
Egyptian Cotton bed sheets.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.158
What's the thread count
on those bad boys?

11:27.240 --> 11:31.074
<i>I guess it was just amazing</i>
<i>to see how much he cared.</i>

11:33.880 --> 11:37.031
- Gotta go.
- Well, well, well.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.669
Snip my pickle and call me Shlomo.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.672
You're not actually applying
for residency director?

11:43.760 --> 11:47.912
I like to think I've accomplished plenty
of things more difficult than this.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.709
Just yesterday morning, I somehow
managed to hack into your voicemail

11:51.800 --> 11:55.315
and change the outgoing message
to "Hi, this is Big Bob."

11:55.400 --> 12:00.030
"I'm not in right now, but at the beep
leave your name and your penis size."

12:00.120 --> 12:02.475
Perry, have you ever wondered

12:02.560 --> 12:06.030
why you've never risen
above clinical staff at this hospital?

12:06.120 --> 12:10.432
Come on, pal. Who do you think
the board listens to

12:10.520 --> 12:12.511
concerning promotions around here?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.511
Why don't I tell you after the beep?

12:14.600 --> 12:18.434
- Beep.
- Bob Kelso. Ten inches.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.390
It's like a baguette.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.552
I can't tell you how awesome
it was today watching you work.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.551
I know, right?

12:38.600 --> 12:41.876
But Schmi <i>tty</i> heard Nurse Green's
been dying to cover surgery.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.349
I said you wouldn't mind
if she took your place.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.638
Schmi <i>tty</i>'s been trying to hit that for
like a minute. I had to hook him up.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.711
You understand, right?

12:50.800 --> 12:55.635
Sure. I'm glad
we could help Schmi <i>tty</i> hit that.

12:57.320 --> 13:02.633
<i>Relationships can be tricky, especially</i>
<i>the ones that have barely begun.</i>

13:02.720 --> 13:07.475
I'm crazy about you, but I've been
going over this in my head all week.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.348
I've been in a long-distance
relationship before. It was a disaster.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.910
I believe a couple has a better chance
if they just cut the cord

13:15.000 --> 13:19.278
and know that if it's meant to be,
fate will bring them back together.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.590
You know?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.791
Totally.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.476
<i>Elliot's in a relationship,</i>
<i>so I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

13:36.560 --> 13:38.710
<i>I just have to accept it and move on.</i>

13:38.800 --> 13:42.793
- I guess this is goodbye.
- <i>Good what?</i>

13:49.000 --> 13:52.276
Look, this doesn't have to be
some huge sad thing.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.119
<i>It's OK. They didn't see you.</i>
<i>What the...?</i>

13:57.200 --> 14:00.158
I know. It's just hard.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.431
Bees.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.315
I'm gonna scrub my hands
and do the scrub-my-hands dance.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.676
Christopher. I know
it's a complicated procedure,

14:17.760 --> 14:21.309
but this afternoon I want you
to assist me on a gastric bypass.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.436
A gastric bypass?

14:23.520 --> 14:25.909
- I'm going to the show?
- You've earned it.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.992
You really turned it up a notch
in surgery yesterday.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.789
I don't know if you had a lucky charm,
but something was different.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.117
Hey, baby. What's up?

14:46.200 --> 14:50.352
You know, I've been thinking.
That was a lot of fun working together.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.871
How long you been thinking that?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.349
Ever since Dr Wen offered me
a gastric bypass

14:56.440 --> 15:00.353
because I was so amazing yesterday,
and I realised you're the reason why.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.793
Really?

15:01.880 --> 15:05.111
In high school, this girlfriend
annoyed the crap out of me,

15:05.200 --> 15:09.193
but when she came to a basketball game,
I played like crazy, out of my mind,

15:09.280 --> 15:11.840
because all of a sudden
I was playing for her.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.673
I wanted to make her proud.
You understand?

15:14.760 --> 15:18.469
I'm so annoying, you can't stand
working with me for even two days.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.835
Now you have something to gain,
you want me.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.151
- Exactly. Thank you.
- I didn't hear an apology in there.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.310
All I heard was nonsense.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.198
You never asked
how I felt about us working together.

15:29.280 --> 15:33.159
Plus, you embarrassed me
in front of my co-workers.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.835
- You were a pain.
- You know what? Maybe I was a pain.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.957
Do you know how many times
you're a pain and I just let it go?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.190
Like when you follow me
from room to room,

15:42.280 --> 15:45.238
- even when I go to the bathroom.
- I like to be with you.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.199
Pain. Or how you've decided
that me making eye contact with you

15:49.280 --> 15:52.716
is my way of saying,
"Please grab my breasts." Don't.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.360
Or your Aaron Neville impression...

15:55.440 --> 15:58.159
- I don't do an Aaron Neville.
- Laverne.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.874
The biggest pain is that you know
I'd go into that operating room with you

16:07.960 --> 16:10.679
if you just apologised,
but you're too stubborn.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.671
I am now.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.397
Tell me this there, Pippi.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.278
- Are you allergic to bee stings?
- I don't know. Why?

16:18.360 --> 16:23.275
It's just that it looks so painful
and possibly infected, I must flick it.

16:23.360 --> 16:28.559
This only happened because my hair-met
got stolen at your stupid suck-up fest.

16:28.640 --> 16:32.394
Now, I took the liberty of writing
the recommendation you promised me.

16:32.480 --> 16:36.029
You sign below where it says,
"He makes me proud to be a doctor"

16:36.120 --> 16:39.396
and above where it says
"He ain't too hard on the eyes either."

16:39.480 --> 16:43.268
This must be
a very proud day for you.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.954
You can't make me feel guilty
for asking for help.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.349
That's just the way the world works.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.194
Most people actually like
helping out the people around them.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.956
Carla would do anything to help out
Turk, no matter what the situation.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.114
He didn't apologise, so back the hell
off. He messes up and I'm the one...

17:02.200 --> 17:05.351
Still, you don't think asking for help
makes you look weak.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.079
You're afraid
of putting yourself out there.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.038
That's why you're never
gonna get anywhere.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.031
Thank you for this.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.799
In hospitals, even though you're
surrounded by hundreds of people,

17:28.880 --> 17:31.952
it's still so easy to get lost
in your own thoughts.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.871
Have you been drinking?

17:33.960 --> 17:37.430
<i>Here I am, t</i> ry <i>ing not to let fear</i>
<i>rule my life anymore.</i>

17:37.520 --> 17:43.470
<i>Sean moves away and I don't even</i>
<i>have the guts to tell him how I feel.</i>

17:43.560 --> 17:47.314
<i>Life's too short not to go for it with</i>
<i>Elliot. Sean's out of the picture.</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:49.152
<i>Stop being such a chicken.</i>

17:49.240 --> 17:52.755
<i>I know it's a complicated procedure,</i>
<i>but I can do it without Carla.</i>

17:52.840 --> 17:54.512
<i>What am I so scared of?</i>

17:54.600 --> 17:57.831
<i>That I might get this job and have</i>
<i>no one to blame it on if I fail?</i>

17:57.920 --> 17:59.672
<i>Good Lord, I'm pathetic.</i>

17:59.760 --> 18:02.274
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>he ever apologised?</i>

18:02.360 --> 18:05.830
<i>I wanna help him, but in a lot of</i>
<i>ways I guess I'm as stubborn as he is.</i>

18:05.920 --> 18:10.516
<i>I wish I could make sense out of this.</i>
<i>30 cents, to be exact. Damn riddle.</i>

18:10.600 --> 18:13.910
<i>Easy, Janitor. You'll get this.</i>

18:27.400 --> 18:29.436
- Sorry.
- No problem, little lady.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.512
I've never left a soul behind.
Got your ticket?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.114
No. I just need to talk to my...

18:44.760 --> 18:48.435
You hate long-distance relationships,
but six months is nothing.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.877
It'll be hard and we'll go a long time
without sex, but I can go that long.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.712
I am a sex camel.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.596
Look, the point is, I'm not ready
for this relationship to end.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.433
Even if you break my heart
right now, it's OK.

19:02.520 --> 19:06.354
I'd regret it more
if I didn't take this shot.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.000
So what do you say?

19:28.280 --> 19:31.989
- We solved your dumb game.
- We been to the libary.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.640
Brary. Troy, library.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.598
Anyway, what two coins,
when you put 'em together,

19:37.680 --> 19:40.956
make 30 cents,
and one of them isn't a nickel?

19:41.040 --> 19:47.195
A penny and 1972 dime
with a Roosevelt imperfection,

19:47.280 --> 19:50.431
today worth exactly 29 cents.

19:52.280 --> 19:55.989
No. The correct answer
is a quarter and a nickel.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.719
No, because you said
one of them isn't a nickel.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.791
Right. The other one is.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.074
- You lied to me.
- No. It's a riddle.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.356
Your face is red like a strawbrary.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.476
<i>Pride's a funny thing.</i>

20:15.560 --> 20:17.471
Don't have kids.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.469
So, shall we all just agree
that Dr Steadman

20:23.560 --> 20:26.393
is our new residency director
and get outta here?

20:26.480 --> 20:31.395
If anyone wants to stop by my condo
to celebrate, my husband made sangria.

20:32.480 --> 20:37.076
Howdy, fellas. Don't you dare get up.
I don't wanna see any broken hips.

20:37.160 --> 20:41.073
<i>A lot of times,</i>
<i>pride can be pretty hard to swallow.</i>

20:41.160 --> 20:43.549
Would you please help me?

20:45.440 --> 20:49.228
So, I think we should make Perry
residency director.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.472
You honestly think the board would
pick him because you had his love baby?

20:57.560 --> 21:01.917
I don't know. Of course, if they don't,
I'm gonna bitch and moan about it

21:02.000 --> 21:03.956
until these nice gentlemen are dead.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.476
- All those in favour of Dr Cox?
- Aye.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.117
So, I guess this pre <i>tty</i> much
makes me your bitch now.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.395
Perry, you always were.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.108
<i>Still, in a good relationship,</i>
<i>pride never gets in the way.</i>

21:23.200 --> 21:26.476
Christopher, are you OK?
You look a little nervous.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.471
He'll be fine.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.436
- Look, I...
- You can tell me later.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.913
Let's do this. Scalpel.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.877
Scalpel, what?

21:39.320 --> 21:41.550
<i>Even if I wanted</i>
<i>to put my pride on the line</i>

21:41.640 --> 21:45.189
<i>and tell Elliot how I feel,</i>
<i>I can't, I have to work tonight.</i>

21:45.280 --> 21:50.195
Seeing as you are partially responsible
for me being the new residency director,

21:50.280 --> 21:52.953
I'm gonna give you
the rest of the night off.

21:53.040 --> 21:58.478
I don't know. It's just kind of
my own personal way of saying

21:58.560 --> 22:01.438
I can't actually stand the sight of you.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.710
<i>I still don't think I should go see her.</i>

22:05.800 --> 22:09.270
<i>Doctors Leeve and Winnerback,</i>
<i>please report to the ER.</i>

22:09.360 --> 22:12.318
<i>Leeve and Winnerback.</i>

22:12.400 --> 22:15.995
Here, buddy. Baby wasn't mine.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.040
- What the hell?
- It's a riddle.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.317
Two guys destroyed your bike
with a crowbar and a bat.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.039
One of 'em wasn't me.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.351
There's something I have to tell you.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.715
Hey, buddy.

23:34.800 --> 23:40.272
Sean's taking a later flight. We decided
to make this long-distance thing work.

23:40.360 --> 23:43.716
I'm so happy I can't stop crying.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.711
Those are nice.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.396
These? I thought Elliot would be sad
with you guys splitting up,

23:50.480 --> 23:52.357
so I just wanted to...

23:52.440 --> 23:57.230
That's so sweet.
You can just put them next to Sean's.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.556
I'm not sure where to...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.468
- You OK?
- Yeah.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.797
I'm not sure
they can reach the water, but...
