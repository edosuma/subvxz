00:01.468 --> 00:03.103
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:06.606
Meet Lee's baby mama. Zoe Sky.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.675
He's got two kids already anyway.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.076
He's a 40-year-old man.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.946
If he ain't got kids and some hot exes,
we'd be worried.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.049
Mom didn't tell me my new babysitter
would be so cute.

00:18.017 --> 00:22.489
<i>Your post with Orlando Lagos was so cool.
I showed it to everyone at school.</i>

00:22.555 --> 00:23.623
Really?

00:23.690 --> 00:26.459
<i>He's one of our favorite players.
How do you know him?</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:28.495
He's just a friend I met at work.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.964
You are both on internal suspension.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.500
You get to decide which you wanna keep,

00:33.566 --> 00:35.935
your word or your job.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.537
No, really...

01:11.504 --> 01:15.074
- I'm just saying. Please, Zoe.
- Mary Jane!

01:15.141 --> 01:18.411
I hope you don't mind.
We got a head start on you.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.013
How are you doing?

01:20.079 --> 01:22.148
- MJ, this is Zoe.
- The ex.

01:22.215 --> 01:25.351
You both know everything
about each other, so...

01:25.418 --> 01:27.053
Sit down, sit down.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.556
God, is this real?

01:30.423 --> 01:35.061
- Yeah.
- I haven't felt real leather in years.

01:35.962 --> 01:39.299
You know,
Lee was just telling me how you met.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.701
- Well played.
- You told her that.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.370
We tell each other most things.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.340
Lee always does like it
when the woman is in charge.

01:48.341 --> 01:49.976
Well, that's good.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.712
I don't mind being the boss
in this relationship.

01:53.413 --> 01:57.951
You know what? His skin is glowing.
You two must be having a lot of sex.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.588
- Okay, let's change the subject.
- Yes, please, Jesus.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.423
Where are your kids? What are they up to?

02:03.490 --> 02:05.558
Katherine's at the ballet workshop

02:05.625 --> 02:08.094
and Aiden's back at the hotel
watching videos.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.196
I'm sure the porn bill
will be astronomical.

02:10.263 --> 02:13.500
I'm sure he'll be telling his friends
how New York City was amazing.

02:15.568 --> 02:16.970
That boy.

02:17.036 --> 02:20.039
That's perfect. Yes. Good timing. Thanks.

02:21.841 --> 02:22.842
Thank you.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.577
Mind the sodium, Lee.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.146
No, it's all good.

02:27.213 --> 02:30.016
Has he told you about his little
high blood pressure problem?

02:30.884 --> 02:33.186
Anything else for you two
and your friend?

02:38.925 --> 02:41.761
Okay, so how serious
is this whole blood pressure thing?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
It's one small pill
every day, that's all.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.565
Then why didn't you tell me?

02:45.632 --> 02:47.667
I'm telling you now, okay?

02:47.734 --> 02:50.436
Okay. Well, for the record,
I don't have any medical issues.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.539
But you obviously have some issues.

02:53.139 --> 02:56.142
Yes, I am in the doghouse at work, but...

02:56.209 --> 02:57.810
Look, I know. I get it.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.880
Zoe can be a handful for anyone. I know.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.049
Especially meeting her like this.

03:03.116 --> 03:07.186
Okay, there's this question
that is shouting at me loud in my mind.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.522
Now I'll ask it
exactly the way I'm hearing it.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.257
- Why aren't you together?
- Come on.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.792
I've heard about this whole

03:12.859 --> 03:16.095
conscious uncoupling thing,
but this is a whole another level.

03:16.162 --> 03:19.399
Put to one side for one second
the fact that I love you,

03:20.166 --> 03:21.968
the explanation is very simple.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.703
She cheated on me.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.906
So, she stepped out on you
and you just drew the line.

03:27.774 --> 03:31.177
Look, commitment's very important to me.
Once that trust was broken...

03:31.244 --> 03:34.280
- Is it really that simple?
- Yes, it is, for me.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.185
Do you still have feelings for her?

03:41.287 --> 03:42.789
In a way, of course.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.325
She's my best friend.
We've got children together.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.793
And, no, it wasn't easy,

03:46.859 --> 03:50.263
but, look,
I'm just not interested in her.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.599
Does she have feelings for you?

04:04.444 --> 04:07.981
You have photos of me
and Sunitha in bed together?

04:08.047 --> 04:09.749
Ava, why did you send me this?

04:09.816 --> 04:13.419
You wouldn't answer my texts.
And, besides, you two were so cute.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.922
Ava, I don't know
what you think you see in me.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.691
I see the child my mother
wishes she had instead of me,

04:18.758 --> 04:20.426
the one taking my place.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.829
Cut to the chase, all right?
What do you want?

04:22.895 --> 04:26.099
I wanna throw a kick-ass party
and I wanna use my mom's place.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.167
And, for that, I need your help.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.969
This is such a bad idea.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.306
We need to get the doorman on board
and codes for the elevator.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.943
Ava, you and I both know
your mother would never go for this.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.545
That's the point. She'll never find out.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.847
You planned this.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.549
Yeah, but that'll sound so lame
when you explain it to her.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.284
Yeah? Well, I'll take my chances.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.420
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.355
No way I'm helping you throw a party.

04:49.422 --> 04:52.191
You don't want me
to show this to her, right?

04:53.092 --> 04:57.230
No, I do, and then she'll figure out
just how crazy you are.

04:57.296 --> 04:59.465
PJ, you can't be that naive.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.135
My mom is in love with you.

05:03.703 --> 05:04.937
You're funny.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.907
You really think that Rolex
is about your business potential?

05:08.775 --> 05:10.543
If I show her these photos, it's over.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.982
I don't care. Send them.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.250
Okay.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.354
Wait. Wait.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.722
I thought so.

05:25.525 --> 05:28.127
Now, what time
should I put on the invite?

05:33.700 --> 05:37.303
After the break, Ronda, we'll hear about
how driving that old gas guzzler

05:37.370 --> 05:39.405
might actually be good for the planet.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.773
Hey! Hey!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.242
- What? What?
- I've been texting you.

05:43.309 --> 05:46.946
You have? Are you sure, honey?
My phone's been quiet.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.316
- Yeah.
- It's dead. My gosh.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.420
Ronda's got me running around
on this McAlister thing.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.256
- I bet.
- What's that?

05:59.559 --> 06:01.661
Bookings I'm logging in.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.564
That's only half the pile.
Justin's got the rest.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.733
I'm sorry, honey. No, I'm sorry.

06:06.799 --> 06:07.900
- Wait.
- What?

06:07.967 --> 06:11.904
I haven't even had a chance to tell you
about Lee's uber hip baby mama.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.540
Okay, I promise we'll go out for drinks.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.276
We'll catch up once this craziness
is all over. Okay?

06:17.343 --> 06:20.279
And I'll answer your text
once my phone wakes up.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.348
I've gotta get these done.

06:22.415 --> 06:23.916
<i>- Kara!
- What?</i>

06:23.983 --> 06:26.285
I'll be right there.
You see what I'm saying?

06:47.807 --> 06:49.742
How long have you been chatting
with my kid?

06:49.809 --> 06:50.977
I don't know.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.914
He sent me a funny meme
and we started chatting.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.850
What do you talk about?

06:58.684 --> 07:02.755
- Mostly just about how great you are.
- Right. Yeah.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.624
Right. Let's see.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.728
I can barely get my son
to return a text message,

07:08.795 --> 07:11.397
but you guys talk so much,
you get a fire emoji.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.266
That's... that's nice.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.801
Isn't this a good thing?

07:14.867 --> 07:17.270
No. See? He sees that.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.674
The women in the hoochie mama dresses,
the drinking.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.145
Orlando, he sees that.

07:28.414 --> 07:32.285
Everybody sees that.
Isn't that the point?

07:32.351 --> 07:35.588
You told me to be seen at these places
because it's good for my brand.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.025
What's good for your brand
and for my son is not the same thing.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.194
Scott reached out and I responded.

07:41.260 --> 07:44.997
Scott knows we're having sex, Orlando.
He thinks we're a couple.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.333
Is that a bad thing?

07:47.400 --> 07:50.369
Yes. How do you think he's gonna feel
when he sees this stuff?

07:50.436 --> 07:53.372
- What do you think his friends will say?
- I don't know.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.075
You don't know, that's your...
Well, that's your answer.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.945
I don't know. I was just trying
to treat him like one of the guys.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.085
What would you like me to do?

08:13.659 --> 08:18.898
Do not talk to my son
on social media at all.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.574
I just started dating
this beautiful woman,

08:28.641 --> 08:31.444
but some things I just don't get.

08:31.510 --> 08:35.047
For example, my girlfriend,
she's a grown-up, you know?

08:35.114 --> 08:37.550
She's mature, beautiful,
very accomplished.

08:37.617 --> 08:40.286
I don't think she'd mind me
saying she's almost 40.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.888
That's what we call a grown-up.

08:42.655 --> 08:47.159
But her mother insisted
that I sleep in the guest bedroom.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.928
And not with her daughter.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.798
And, yet, her mom felt the need
to protect her daughter's innocence,

08:52.865 --> 08:55.134
whilst her granddaughter

08:55.201 --> 08:58.571
is sleeping in the house,
living there rent-free

08:58.638 --> 09:02.108
with her two children who she had
with two different dads.

09:11.484 --> 09:15.087
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Lee Truitt. I appreciate you guys.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.735
Hey. What's up?

09:30.369 --> 09:33.839
You didn't like the set.
Come on, the audience loved it, admit it.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.677
- You popped off about my niece?
- I didn't say anything she'd object to.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.946
No, if she was here,
she'd be real salty about it.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.049
Why? I didn't call her kids
bastards or illegitimate or anything.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.984
No, you might as well have.

09:45.751 --> 09:50.323
No, I'm very careful about that.
All kids are legitimate. They are.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.626
There are so many born out of wedlock,
we ought to stop stigmatizing them.

09:54.393 --> 09:57.997
If you ask me, it's the institution
of marriage that's illegitimate.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.233
I thought commitment
meant so much to you.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.836
It does. It's not the same
as marriage, though.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.107
I didn't realize you were so against it.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.577
Well, until now.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.380
Okay, so, what exactly do you believe?

10:14.447 --> 10:17.416
The institution of marriage
is dated and hypocritical.

10:17.483 --> 10:18.718
Hypocritical.

10:20.619 --> 10:22.088
- Okay...
- Come on.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.857
Look, how often
does "'til death do us part"

10:24.924 --> 10:27.259
actually mean until the divorce is final?

10:29.528 --> 10:30.596
What?

10:31.497 --> 10:36.235
First Zoe and now this?
This is... This is a lot, Lee.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.504
All at once.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.454
So, anyone who worked
with McAlister and Elmore

10:55.521 --> 10:57.490
during that time
is suddenly unavailable.

10:57.556 --> 11:00.893
Mary Jane's interview the other day
sent off warning flares to anybody.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.497
Yeah, and I'm sure McAlister
got to a few of them as well, so...

11:04.563 --> 11:06.298
It's tough not having Justin's source

11:06.365 --> 11:08.601
to help us make sense
of the facts and figures.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.670
Maybe we should try a different angle.

11:12.204 --> 11:14.340
Like a statistician.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.876
- You don't give up, do you?
- No.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.111
I really appreciate your professionalism.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.814
Don't try to sweet talk me.

11:23.549 --> 11:26.552
Make no mistake.
I know where your allegiance lies.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.220
I'm just here to do my job.

11:29.121 --> 11:32.158
And your side keeps growing every day.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.326
What do you mean?

11:34.393 --> 11:38.130
I'm afraid having Justin join the team
may have been a mistake.

11:38.798 --> 11:42.835
I now see that he's the type of guy
that'd sell out his mother for a story.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.805
Yeah. Well...

11:48.641 --> 11:50.643
<i>Check out what I just sent you.</i>

11:50.709 --> 11:53.145
<i>-Should I be worried?
- Okay, hold on.</i>

11:54.580 --> 11:57.716
It was taken two minutes ago
and he's drunk off his ass.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.919
It's not even cocktail
hour yet, you know?

11:59.985 --> 12:03.823
Kara Lynch, as I live and breathe,
are you jealous?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.258
Girl, please, please. No, absolutely not.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.428
I just have two boys that follow
every single move this guy makes

12:09.495 --> 12:13.599
and they think their mom's involved
in a fairytale fantasy romance with him.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.034
Then cut and run.

12:16.936 --> 12:18.204
I don't think I can.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.307
Well, I think I may have some news
that can distract you.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.776
I think I may have found
Justin's source.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.345
Yeah, a clerk that used to work
for Judge McAlister.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.749
Okay, are you gonna give it up
when you find out who it is?

12:30.816 --> 12:34.820
Absolutely. I've gotta save myself,
'cause Justin's not going to.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.289
Wait, Kara, I've gotta go.
I've gotta go.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.332
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

12:46.398 --> 12:48.234
She is not gonna talk to you.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.303
Justin, what the hell?
How did you know I was gonna be here?

12:51.370 --> 12:53.739
- Are you keeping tabs on me?
- Maybe.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.308
Look, my source gave me a lead.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.576
I can share it.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.247
I've just gotta know
you won't share it with Kara and Ronda.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.152
What's it gonna be?

13:08.888 --> 13:09.922
I'm in.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.503
You have a problem with this hotel?

13:25.271 --> 13:28.474
You said that this would be
a mutual meeting spot.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.977
- You... you live here.
- Is there a problem with that?

13:32.044 --> 13:34.547
No, I just thought maybe, you know,

13:34.613 --> 13:36.916
you'd find something
more permanent by now.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.484
Do you have something permanent?

13:38.551 --> 13:41.921
- I closed escrow three weeks ago.
- Of course you did.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.591
Well, you know, we should just focus
on the matter at hand.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.326
- Don't you think?
- Okay.

13:47.393 --> 13:51.530
My source was a legal clerk
for McAlister back in the Charlotte days.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.532
It took her a while,
but she could track down

13:53.599 --> 13:56.735
the ex-convict
who was railroaded by McAlister

13:57.369 --> 13:59.572
who's also on his way here.

13:59.638 --> 14:02.541
- You invited a convict here?
- I didn't know it was your suite.

14:03.342 --> 14:07.012
And he's not a convict, all right?
He's a wrongly-convicted man.

14:07.079 --> 14:10.749
McAlister is the one
with implicit bias, not me.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.985
Are you sure?

14:13.052 --> 14:14.987
Let me do the talking and you'll see.

14:15.621 --> 14:16.922
I don't know.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.959
Do you think he's the kind of guy
that can relate to...

14:20.025 --> 14:22.595
a woman with a 10 000 dollar purse?

14:22.661 --> 14:24.363
You knew how much my purse cost,

14:24.430 --> 14:27.366
and you somehow think
you're more relatable than me.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.567
Really?

14:28.634 --> 14:32.705
With your tailored shirts
and your designer shoes.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.608
Don't come here
like you're from the projects.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.677
I actually did live in public housing.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.413
I also lived
in a four-bedroom house with a pool.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.450
My father was a car salesman.
It was boom or bust.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.118
We lived all over the damn place.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.356
I pride myself on being able
to talk to just about anybody.

14:51.690 --> 14:55.160
Lecturing people isn't the same
as talking to them, Justin.

14:55.227 --> 14:59.832
I don't lecture.
I strive to listen more and speak less.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.001
We can't agree on anything.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.469
Certainly not that.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.739
I bet we can't agree
on the color of the walls.

15:09.174 --> 15:12.111
I think... aubergine.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.953
- It's more of a boysenberry.
- I just proved my point!

15:21.020 --> 15:24.523
Thank you. Thank you. We cannot agree.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.865
This is insanity.
This guy's not gonna show.

15:38.170 --> 15:42.207
Well, I think that's something
that we can both agree on.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.353
I'm fine. I'm not afraid.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.693
You're the reporters?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.664
Come on in.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.237
How did you wind up getting arrested?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.373
I wasn't no saint as a teenager.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.642
I did what I had to survive

16:16.709 --> 16:19.812
which, at the time,
meant hooking up with the wrong crew.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.381
So, suffice it to say,
the cops knew who you were.

16:23.849 --> 16:27.720
And I knew them, too.
All of them. By name.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.492
There came a time a kid
got served on my block.

16:33.559 --> 16:37.229
A regular kid. Just happened
to be wearing the wrong jersey.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.664
He got killed.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.266
Took a bullet to the head.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.437
The cops put my photo
in a line-up and she picked me out.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.376
She shot tears out of her eyes
on the witness stand.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.245
And that's when I knew...

16:54.213 --> 16:55.914
I was going to prison.

16:58.951 --> 17:03.489
So, you didn't do the shooting,
but you were prosecuted for it.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.724
She was straight up wrong.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.593
But she wouldn't let it go.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.329
A lot of people are in prison
for similar crimes,

17:10.396 --> 17:12.197
who, as you know, say the same thing.

17:12.264 --> 17:15.801
I wasn't even there. I was with a friend.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.705
I had a solid alibi witness
and Judge McAlister knew it.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.608
But they made up some felony charges
against my friend

17:22.674 --> 17:26.311
and then threatened to prosecute him
if he testified on my behalf.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.247
Can anyone else corroborate this?

17:30.048 --> 17:31.283
My witness.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.620
But he's dead now.

17:37.289 --> 17:40.192
He was shot in a crack house
11 years ago.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.395
Is there anyone else?

17:43.462 --> 17:46.732
Yeah, McAlister bragged to my attorney

17:46.799 --> 17:49.134
that he knew my witness was solid.

17:49.201 --> 17:53.038
But he was determined to put me away
for everything else I had done.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.409
Let me get this straight.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.879
The man that's about to be nominated
for the Supreme Court

18:00.946 --> 18:05.083
knew there was exculpatory evidence,
but chose to prosecute you anyway?

18:05.150 --> 18:09.755
He was happy to finally find something,
anything to put on me,

18:10.355 --> 18:11.657
whether it was true or not.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.959
You know what I feel like?

18:16.195 --> 18:20.666
Like I was in prison for who I was,
not for what I did.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.670
Why didn't you come forward earlier?

18:24.736 --> 18:26.538
Coming forward is risky.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.376
I did my time straight through.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.646
I went for unconditional release
over parole,

18:34.713 --> 18:37.516
which meant I could have a new start.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.220
Now I've got a job,

18:41.987 --> 18:44.723
a young family,
I've got a church community.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.160
Not many people other than my wife
know about my past.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.263
So, I've got a lot to lose.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.639
Linger on his face just a little longer.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.075
<i>Not many people other than my wife...</i>

19:03.141 --> 19:04.443
That's nice.

19:04.510 --> 19:05.511
Yeah.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.814
<i>I've got a lot to lose.</i>

19:08.881 --> 19:11.350
- Too bad it's all for nothing.
- What do you mean?

19:11.416 --> 19:13.485
You know Garrett'll give
this story to Ronda.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.654
He almost said as much.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.826
You've gotta stand up for yourself.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.094
How?

19:23.262 --> 19:25.097
That's for you to decide.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.332
But I will tell you this.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.735
You've gotta make your own luck
in this business.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.671
You read Ronda's autobiography, right?

19:32.738 --> 19:35.474
I did. She said she never got anywhere
playing it safe.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.708
Exactly.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.714
What? I can't push Garrett that hard.
I need this job.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.483
Okay.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.586
What do you need more?

19:48.487 --> 19:51.490
A job or a seat at the table?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.961
It's for you to decide,
but whatever you choose,

19:56.028 --> 19:57.563
I'll back you up.

20:11.810 --> 20:15.480
Tell me you're not using the back door
because you're hoping not to run into me.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.883
I'm using the back door
because I'm on suspension,

20:17.950 --> 20:20.252
and I hate running
the gauntlet on the way in.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.022
Okay, then let's get you off suspension.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.625
Tell me, how did it go
with Justin's source?

20:26.692 --> 20:28.060
- Good.
- Yeah?

20:28.126 --> 20:29.995
- Great, actually. Yeah.
- Okay.

20:32.297 --> 20:36.501
Oh, boy. I know you, MJ.
Here comes the crazy. What is it?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.037
Justin and I
are working the story in secret

20:39.104 --> 20:41.139
and we're gonna take it
straight to Garrett.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.241
You're not gonna give me the information?

20:43.842 --> 20:44.876
No.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.112
Was this your idea?

20:47.179 --> 20:50.282
- It was Justin's.
- Justin? What? You're following his lead?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.317
What about your promise to me, Mary Jane?

20:52.384 --> 20:54.186
What choice do I have, seriously?

20:54.252 --> 20:56.455
I either go along with Justin,

20:56.521 --> 21:00.392
or I watch Ronda use my material
on air and win another Peabody.

21:00.459 --> 21:03.595
The two of us could have come up
with a solution together.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.063
I'm sorry.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.299
I'm on suspension
and it's screwing with my head.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.301
Watch your back.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.536
Don't trust him.

21:21.246 --> 21:25.450
This place is ridiculous.
You heard about it all the way in London?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.185
My photographer friend, Dario,

21:27.252 --> 21:30.255
shot these designers for Italian "Vogue."

21:30.322 --> 21:32.924
They'll be all the rage in a few months.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.160
- Do you hear that?
- What?

21:35.227 --> 21:38.230
It's the sound of my credit card
screaming for mercy.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.166
I know. Right?

21:41.633 --> 21:44.369
God. I want all of them.
What did you get?

21:44.436 --> 21:45.837
- Cute, right?
- Yes.

21:45.904 --> 21:48.607
- I'm gonna try these on.
- Yes, you must.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.676
And I'm gonna try it on
if you don't want them.

21:59.384 --> 22:02.421
Don't worry, I'm only sending it to Lee.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.557
You know what? Look. Let's try this.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.895
Yeah. Hold up one sec.

22:09.961 --> 22:11.396
My God, look.

22:13.699 --> 22:16.568
I used not to shave. Allergic to stubble.

22:17.669 --> 22:21.473
"Don't worry.
The bush is still impenetrable.

22:21.540 --> 22:25.410
1970s centerfold style, baby."
Smiley, winky smiley.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.912
Okay, okay, I don't get it.

22:26.978 --> 22:31.083
I don't get it. You are beautiful.
Your body of life.

22:31.149 --> 22:34.086
You are the hippest black woman
I've probably ever met.

22:34.152 --> 22:35.487
You're successful.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.989
You and Lee should be together.
I'm just a...

22:41.626 --> 22:45.263
That's why Lee and I
are not getting back together.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.801
Don't worry, I'm not into you, you know?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.137
That would be too stereotypical,
wouldn't it?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.306
But it was either that or slap you, so...

22:55.874 --> 22:57.909
Come see some photos.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.615
I fell in love with a woman.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.751
- My God. She's stunning.
- Isn't she, though?

23:05.817 --> 23:08.820
I recognize her. She's a model.
You're dating a model.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.989
I wouldn't care if she were a waitress.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.793
This relationship is like
nothing I've ever had before.

23:14.860 --> 23:15.894
Really?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.698
Have you ever felt
like you've found your soulmate?

23:20.699 --> 23:24.136
Like the other person
knows everything about you already

23:24.202 --> 23:27.572
and is still willing
to explore new things

23:27.639 --> 23:29.241
and grow with you.

23:29.808 --> 23:30.876
I think so.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.178
I finally found that person.

23:34.846 --> 23:39.351
And I'm delighted that Lee
seems to have found his, too.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.989
- Well, that deserves another round.
- I agree.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.292
Yes, yes, more.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.729
You've gotta let a bitch know
when you'll kiss them. That's some shit.

23:53.665 --> 23:56.968
<i>Now I've got a job, I've got a family,</i>

23:57.035 --> 23:58.670
<i>a church community.</i>

23:58.737 --> 24:01.940
<i>Not many people other than my wife
know about my past.</i>

24:02.007 --> 24:03.942
<i>So I've got a lot to lose.</i>

24:06.778 --> 24:09.848
So... there it is.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.991
Ronda, Kara, get in here.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.560
- Wait a minute.
- Not a word.

24:23.328 --> 24:24.796
- What's up?
- Yeah?

24:24.863 --> 24:27.399
Mary Jane and Justin
have interviewed a gentleman

24:27.465 --> 24:29.401
who Judge McAlister wrongly convicted.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.803
- While on suspension?
- It's a bombshell of a story.

24:31.870 --> 24:34.873
We can't have our team
working at cross purposes.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.608
It's unprofessional.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.276
Weakens us all.

24:38.343 --> 24:41.746
I agree. The network will pull out
all the stops and will make sure

24:41.813 --> 24:46.484
that this story goes to air
in a major rating boosting roll out.

24:46.551 --> 24:50.222
It'll be a major scoop which reverberates
throughout the Congressional Committee.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.091
And Ronda will present every word.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.461
Okay, wait a minute.
This is very awkward for me.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.597
I know you and Mary Jane are close.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.066
If you want to step aside,
I can find another producer.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.339
- No, I'll do it.
- No.

25:07.405 --> 25:08.874
You don't have a choice here.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.409
I do have a choice.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.213
You give Ronda the story...

25:16.815 --> 25:19.050
I resign. Immediately.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.986
Wait a minute, Mary Jane, come on.

25:21.052 --> 25:24.923
This is our story, Kara.
Mine and Justin's.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.224
From the beginning.

25:27.125 --> 25:30.061
You planned this? This was your idea?

25:30.729 --> 25:33.198
- Not all of it.
- Anything else you wanna say?

25:33.832 --> 25:36.868
If Mary Jane walks, I walk too.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.211
Today, it's one surprise
after the next with you guys.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.513
Maybe I was too hasty.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.249
Taking into account
the unexpectedly strong feelings...

25:51.316 --> 25:52.417
That is crap!

25:52.484 --> 25:55.820
I think the team that landed this whale
should take it to air.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.622
Come on, now. What do you have?

25:57.689 --> 26:01.459
Just what? One case here?
That does not a pattern make.

26:01.526 --> 26:04.663
Come on, it's not like, you know,
it's gonna dent McAlister.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.365
Please, Ronda, don't demean yourself.

26:07.432 --> 26:10.502
A minute ago, you were panting
to be the one to take this out.

26:10.568 --> 26:13.872
By the way, Ronda,
in this era of Black Lives Matter,

26:13.939 --> 26:17.409
one hint of bias is enough
to make a difference.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.612
Mary Jane and Justin will do the story,
that's final.

26:32.824 --> 26:36.461
And, guys, that trick works
once with me.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.265
You pull that again
and you are both out on your asses.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.822
Girl!

27:05.790 --> 27:08.226
I was so worried
about you for a minute there.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.963
- About time I scored a win against Ronda.
- That was a freaking great move.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.398
That was brilliant.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.968
Are you sure you're okay
with us doing it?

27:17.035 --> 27:20.005
Yes. Please, girl.
A win for you is always a win for me.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.973
Good. I'm glad you're with me.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.274
Of course. Come on.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.944
- So, what about you? What's up?
- What?

27:26.011 --> 27:28.213
Have you solved your problem
with the ballplayer?

27:29.447 --> 27:31.816
He's coming over later.
I just... you know what?

27:31.883 --> 27:33.685
I'm gonna have it out with him.

27:33.752 --> 27:37.989
I don't wanna talk about that.
What about you?

27:38.056 --> 27:39.491
Did you pass the baby mama test?

27:39.557 --> 27:43.928
I just have to survive one more dinner,
but the kids have signed off on me.

27:44.829 --> 27:48.099
- Then all your hurdles are behind you.
- Except for one.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.269
I still don't know where he stands
on having more kids.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.905
Well... where do you stand
on that subject?

27:53.972 --> 27:57.342
Where do you think? Do I have to draw you
a picture of my shriveling uterus?

27:57.409 --> 27:59.244
I don't know. You should think about it

27:59.310 --> 28:01.746
because having some kids
will make you think twice

28:01.813 --> 28:03.715
about pulling that move you just made.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.216
True, true.

28:05.283 --> 28:07.619
But the relationship is moving along.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.088
It's nice to talk about these things.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.158
You have changed.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.326
I know. I have.

28:15.393 --> 28:17.128
And I'm not done yet.

28:20.698 --> 28:21.766
Justin.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.409
I'm very disappointed in you.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.711
Somehow, I knew that might be the case.

28:33.778 --> 28:36.281
I brought you here.
And you completely let me down.

28:36.347 --> 28:37.949
You took your big foot

28:38.016 --> 28:40.685
and stomped on what could be
the biggest moment of my career.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.354
It wasn't your moment,
it's not your story, and...

28:43.421 --> 28:45.924
No one does that to me
and gets away with it,

28:45.990 --> 28:47.792
do you understand me? No one.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.730
You picked your side. Well,
you'd better hope it's the right one.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.768
Wow, it's totally quiet.

29:30.835 --> 29:33.037
Yeah, your silent disco is pretty hot.

29:33.104 --> 29:36.074
You can rock the house
and the neighbors would never hear it.

29:36.141 --> 29:40.044
A totally chill idea, PJ.
I knew you'd get in the swing of it.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.579
Now have some fun.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.017
My God...

30:06.137 --> 30:08.373
<i>- Hi.
- Bonsoir.</i>

30:08.439 --> 30:09.908
What are you doing here?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.976
- What? What are you doing here?
- I live here.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:15.413 --> 30:16.681
What's up?

30:20.251 --> 30:22.554
- Scott.
- Yeah?

30:22.620 --> 30:24.289
He keeps sending me snaps.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.059
I feel bad not returning them.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.428
So, tell me, why aren't we talking again?

30:32.864 --> 30:35.967
My kids are falling for you
a lot faster than I am.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.570
- And that's not good.
- No, that's not good.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.238
Because the more you talk to them,

30:40.305 --> 30:42.040
the more they'll think we're an item,

30:42.106 --> 30:47.612
and then the more confused they'll be
when you decide to... move on.

30:51.482 --> 30:55.420
And what if I decided not to move on?

30:56.287 --> 30:59.490
You know, what if we try to be...
You know?

30:59.557 --> 31:02.594
What's the word? Unanimous.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.230
Monogamous?

31:05.296 --> 31:07.832
- Are you kidding?
- Yes, I'm kidding.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.000
God...

31:09.500 --> 31:12.003
- Let's do it.
- What?

31:12.070 --> 31:14.072
- You could never!
- No?

31:14.138 --> 31:17.008
- No. Absolutely not.
- I am a quick learner.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.945
I couldn't get a change up
once before, too.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.448
Yeah, well,
I'm not a change up, papi, so...

31:24.349 --> 31:27.452
No, you are definitely
a fast ball straight inside.

31:27.518 --> 31:29.687
Yes, I am a fast...

31:30.622 --> 31:33.791
I've got work to do.
What are you doing here?

31:33.858 --> 31:37.428
- I'm a professional.
- God, Orlando, stop it.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.497
God, you crazy man. Stop it!

31:47.572 --> 31:48.706
Hey.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.343
So, this is how you party in Manhattan?

31:52.410 --> 31:53.711
- Yeah, listen...
- It is lit.

31:53.778 --> 31:56.080
Look, you're not messing
with Ava, are you?

31:56.147 --> 32:00.285
Man, she's the one you ought to talk to.
She's the one all up in me, bro.

32:00.351 --> 32:04.756
- My God, help me! My sister!
- Someone call 911!

32:04.822 --> 32:06.891
Move. Move.

32:06.958 --> 32:09.193
My sister!

32:10.428 --> 32:11.996
Hey, hey!

32:12.063 --> 32:15.300
Hey, hey, lady! Somebody help!

32:15.366 --> 32:17.602
Ava, come over here! Call 911!

32:29.681 --> 32:32.450
So, given the personal cost to you,

32:32.517 --> 32:34.585
why did you decide to come forward now?

32:34.652 --> 32:38.189
I knew I'd have to speak up when I heard
his name mentioned for the Supreme Court.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.424
Why?

32:39.490 --> 32:42.827
Someone like that shouldn't sit
on the highest court in the US.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.163
Not after what he did to me.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.140
Mary Jane.

32:59.077 --> 33:02.146
I want to congratulate you on the win.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.816
Your interview was flawless.

33:05.383 --> 33:06.351
Thank you.

33:06.884 --> 33:09.921
And word just came in
from the White House.

33:09.987 --> 33:13.691
McAlister has called a press conference
for tomorrow in Charlotte.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.393
He withdrew his name?

33:16.060 --> 33:18.596
That's what one powerful story can do.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.631
Your story was powerful...

33:21.699 --> 33:23.768
So powerful it cost me money.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.002
I don't follow.

33:25.069 --> 33:29.674
Your victory motivated me
to stop fuzzing around with my contract.

33:29.741 --> 33:33.277
My agent and I had to leave
a little money on the table, but...

33:33.344 --> 33:34.712
What's a few dollars

33:34.779 --> 33:37.181
against the security
of a five-year contract?

33:39.083 --> 33:40.318
So, it's done.

33:41.719 --> 33:43.554
I just signed it
while you were on the air.

33:46.391 --> 33:47.992
Poetic, isn't it?

33:50.495 --> 33:51.929
Great job, though.

34:04.475 --> 34:05.710
Congrats.

34:07.145 --> 34:11.682
Thank you for...
pushing me to stand up to Garrett.

34:11.749 --> 34:13.518
You did what needed to be done.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.621
Now Garrett
can never look at you the same.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.791
Well, neither can Ronda.
For better or for worse.

34:21.225 --> 34:24.595
- You hear she signed her contract?
- Yeah, because she's scared of you.

34:24.662 --> 34:27.398
It's not me she's scared of.
It's irrelevancy.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.067
But who brings that out?

34:29.801 --> 34:31.035
Natalie?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.271
Sylvia?

34:34.005 --> 34:36.107
No. It's you.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.145
You'd think I'd be better prepared
for these situations.

34:41.212 --> 34:43.648
Stay ready,
so you don't have to get ready.

34:43.714 --> 34:47.018
After everything
that happened in Atlanta...

34:47.084 --> 34:48.686
Yeah.

34:49.086 --> 34:50.688
You're still stuck back there?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.791
Yeah, you know,
losing your first big job...

34:53.858 --> 34:55.259
kind of hard to get over.

34:55.326 --> 34:58.930
I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from back then.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.598
So, you didn't have a problem with me?

35:06.404 --> 35:08.906
No. No, I did have a problem with you.

35:08.973 --> 35:12.143
Why? Because I stole your spot
as the "star Negro" at the network?

35:14.178 --> 35:16.347
Because I hate to see talent wasted.

35:18.816 --> 35:20.351
It sure didn't feel that way.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.020
Look, I...

35:24.021 --> 35:25.890
I never tried to thwart you.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.693
I was trying to push you to excel.

35:28.759 --> 35:31.529
- The push part, I got.
- Yeah.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.166
Is that why you had to push back?

35:36.367 --> 35:37.602
Get at me first?

35:39.537 --> 35:41.138
You didn't think I knew about that.

35:41.205 --> 35:42.707
I was trying to protect myself.

35:42.773 --> 35:45.443
But you didn't do a very good job.
You know why?

35:47.678 --> 35:50.715
Because you didn't have anybody
to watch your back.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.785
But now you do.

35:57.054 --> 35:58.222
Do I?

35:58.289 --> 36:00.224
I think you can go all the way.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.425
With your help.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.495
Yeah.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.031
With my help.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.939
I am on the hook
for a six-figure hospital bill

36:15.006 --> 36:17.341
for that poor girl who overdosed.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.343
At least she's okay, thankfully.

36:19.410 --> 36:22.213
And the cleaning fee.
That was another few thousand.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.716
Olivia, I'm really,
really sorry about all of this,

36:25.783 --> 36:30.421
and I know money will not make up
for your lost trust in me.

36:30.488 --> 36:32.924
But I really hope this will be a start.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.825
You think you can buy
your way out of this?

36:34.892 --> 36:36.260
I don't. No.

36:37.895 --> 36:39.630
I know this stunt wasn't you.

36:42.266 --> 36:47.071
Now then, it has Ava written all over it.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.507
Olivia, I'll take full responsibility.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.475
Ava didn't put you up to this?

36:53.444 --> 36:55.947
Because I know she can be persuasive.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.783
Olivia, I put myself in this situation.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.153
I'm sorry. I...

37:02.219 --> 37:04.488
Why can't Ava be like that?

37:04.555 --> 37:07.625
I thought things were getting better
with her and now...

37:08.426 --> 37:10.261
I'm even more worried.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.765
I think she's using you to get to me.

37:16.334 --> 37:17.501
I'm sorry.

37:21.706 --> 37:22.940
Don't be.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.020
- PJ...
- No, wait.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.222
Is this why you've helped me
this entire time?

37:38.289 --> 37:40.825
- It didn't start out that way.
- I wish I could believe it.

37:40.891 --> 37:44.929
I mean, all this talk about the invisible
barriers that we'd break down...

37:44.996 --> 37:46.230
Can't both be true?

37:46.297 --> 37:48.499
Can't I like you
and also wanna help you, too?

37:48.566 --> 37:51.535
All this time, I thought it was Ava
that I had to worry about.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.506
This doesn't have
to change anything, PJ.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.174
Sadly, it does.

37:58.075 --> 38:00.411
I'll have Clint Olson
take over your account.

38:00.478 --> 38:04.482
He's a senior partner
and you will be very happy with him.

38:05.449 --> 38:06.784
Here...

38:06.851 --> 38:08.486
I appreciate your help.

38:09.153 --> 38:11.756
I'm very grateful for everything
that you've done for me.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.659
But I think it's time for me to move on.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.331
I'm sorry.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.970
PJ, wait. Don't...

38:36.914 --> 38:39.350
Gluten free soy mac and cheese,

38:39.417 --> 38:41.986
or broccoli noodles?

38:42.053 --> 38:43.287
Tough choice.

38:43.354 --> 38:45.022
All right, cut it out, you two.

38:45.089 --> 38:50.461
Wait. Did we just have a moment
that Zoe could not relate to?

38:50.528 --> 38:52.897
- Major win for Mary Jane.
- I agree.

38:52.963 --> 38:56.667
Do you know the best thing about my trip

38:56.734 --> 38:59.770
has been to find you
so chill in person, Mary Jane.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.640
It's so different
from the way you are on TV.

39:02.707 --> 39:05.142
Well, you have opened my mind as well.

39:05.209 --> 39:08.345
I mean, you know,
I can only hope that one day

39:08.412 --> 39:11.482
Lee and I can actually get
as comfortable as you and Lee.

39:11.549 --> 39:12.650
Stop it.

39:12.717 --> 39:15.586
Well, that's worthy of a toast. Yes.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.555
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.

39:22.226 --> 39:26.130
It's great you can sense
how comfortable Lee and I are...

39:27.164 --> 39:30.601
because I'm going
to really open up myself here

39:30.668 --> 39:33.170
and ask for a huge favor.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.072
We're not having a threesome.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.108
I'm serious, Lee.

39:38.509 --> 39:41.712
So, Karen and I
want to have a child together.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.482
Congratulations.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.084
We'll use her egg, which she has frozen,

39:47.151 --> 39:51.055
and I will carry the baby,
so I can participate in the birth.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.091
And we really

39:54.158 --> 39:55.793
want this new baby to be connected

39:55.860 --> 39:58.529
to their older siblings
in a special way.

39:59.630 --> 40:03.334
So, Karen and I would like to know, Lee,

40:03.400 --> 40:05.603
will you be the sperm donor?
