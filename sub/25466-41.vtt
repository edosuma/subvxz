Don't forget
your little toothpick swords.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.932
[all laugh]

08:18.802 --> 08:21.239
[all chattering]

08:21.283 --> 08:22.589
Now, fight!

08:34.644 --> 08:36.516
[laughing maniacally]

08:36.559 --> 08:37.691
The Brain.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.170
Surprised, Titans?

08:39.214 --> 08:42.565
My new suit has the ability
to teleport me anywhere.

08:42.609 --> 08:43.697
[laughing sinisterly]

08:43.740 --> 08:44.741
Titans, go!

08:46.308 --> 08:47.309
[roaring]

08:53.402 --> 08:55.056
[all yelling]

08:57.841 --> 08:59.582
[straining]

09:01.671 --> 09:02.933
[laughing]

09:08.286 --> 09:09.636
[all] Ow! Ow!

09:11.638 --> 09:13.422
[all grunting]

09:13.465 --> 09:14.989
So easy.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.294
You may have stopped us,

09:16.338 --> 09:18.079
but you still need
to stop them.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.605
-Who?
-They're right there.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.824
In front of you on the table?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.609
I really don't see anything.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.263
He's talking about us!

09:28.306 --> 09:29.830
Down here! Hey!

09:29.873 --> 09:30.744
[squeaking]

09:30.787 --> 09:33.137
Oh, I think I hear squeaking.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.791
We've got to get
to that exhaust port.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.706
It's the suit's only weakness.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.709
[yelling]

09:39.753 --> 09:41.276
You mean, this exhaust port?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.452
No!

09:43.495 --> 09:44.758
Although, it makes sense

09:44.801 --> 09:46.194
he'd remedy
the suit's only weakness.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.631
I guess it doesn't matter
who ends up on the Titans,

09:48.675 --> 09:49.719
since we're both garbage.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.896
We are,
but only when we're small.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.248
Aah!
Where did you come from?

09:57.292 --> 09:58.554
It's over, Brain!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.469
Strength of a grown man!

10:00.774 --> 10:02.297
[yelling]

10:02.340 --> 10:05.735
Whoa! You've discovered
my suit's only weakness!

10:05.779 --> 10:07.911
It's top-heavy. [straining]

10:07.955 --> 10:09.609
Nice teamwork, Atom.

10:09.652 --> 10:10.697
Let's go free the Titans.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.350
Wait. We've got
to shrink back down

10:12.394 --> 10:14.570
so they think we did it
as small heroes.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.572
Hmm, smart.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.272
[straining]

10:21.316 --> 10:25.233
Oh, Bumblebee and The Atom
used their teeny tiny powers

10:25.276 --> 10:26.626
to rescue us.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.410
Ah. I guess we's was wrong.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.673
You tiny heroes
aren't so useless after all.

10:30.717 --> 10:34.329
Once again, the mighty Atom
stands victorious-- [grunts]

10:34.372 --> 10:35.722
Yes! We're free!

10:35.765 --> 10:37.201
[beeping]
