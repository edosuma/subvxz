01:06.218 --> 01:07.761
Good morning, Doctor.

01:10.013 --> 01:12.474
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:12.516 --> 01:14.393
I'm good.

01:14.434 --> 01:15.852
It worked.

01:17.604 --> 01:21.024
I feel so much better
than even yesterday.

01:21.066 --> 01:23.360
Sleeping better and
feeling a lot better.

01:25.654 --> 01:30.659
It will be great to join
up with my family again.

01:30.701 --> 01:32.911
Next week's my daughter's birthday.

01:32.953 --> 01:34.955
It would be quite a great homecoming.

01:34.996 --> 01:37.541
I just want to say, Dr. Greiss,
that I'm feeling a lot better

01:37.582 --> 01:39.710
today than I was yesterday,
and yesterday I was feeling

01:39.751 --> 01:42.921
better than before that and
tomorrow I'm gonna feel better.

01:42.963 --> 01:46.925
Doctor, please! You already helped me,
Dr. Greiss, I'm fine!

01:59.312 --> 02:01.064
Multiple sources reporting

02:01.106 --> 02:03.483
that a fire has broken out
at Eloise causing significant...

02:03.525 --> 02:05.444
Witnesses reported seeing

02:05.485 --> 02:07.696
smoke and hearing screams
a little after 10:00 o'clock

02:07.738 --> 02:09.823
last night as firefighters
rushed to the scene...

02:09.865 --> 02:11.158
Reportedly broke out

02:11.199 --> 02:13.201
just after 10:00 PM last night.

02:13.243 --> 02:15.829
The cause of the fire is not
yet known but investigators

02:15.871 --> 02:17.664
believe it was intentional...

02:17.706 --> 02:18.999
Multiple casualties, among them,

02:19.040 --> 02:20.959
Dr. H. H. Greiss,

02:21.001 --> 02:23.462
Chief physician at Eloise
known for his controversial

02:23.503 --> 02:25.881
and brutal therapies.

02:25.922 --> 02:27.883
And vicious medical experiments.

02:27.924 --> 02:29.509
It's also believed that
many patients perished

02:29.551 --> 02:31.011
in the fire as well...

02:31.052 --> 02:32.846
Firefighters rushed

02:32.888 --> 02:35.348
to the scene but were too late
for many patients and staff

02:35.390 --> 02:37.309
who were trapped on
the upper floors of Eloise

02:37.350 --> 02:40.395
and are believed to have
died in the blaze.

02:43.523 --> 02:45.192
In the years since its closing

02:45.233 --> 02:46.902
in 1982 after the fire.

02:46.943 --> 02:49.696
Countless locals have explored
the vacant buildings

02:49.738 --> 02:52.532
of Eloise and reported
chilling tales of hearing voices

02:52.574 --> 02:55.952
or screams and in some cases,
seeing apparitions

02:55.994 --> 02:59.080
or even ghosts
of deceased patients and staff

02:59.122 --> 03:02.292
roaming the asylum's empty,
decrepit corridors,

03:02.334 --> 03:04.294
prisoners still.

03:04.336 --> 03:06.087
One former patient was reported

03:06.129 --> 03:08.924
as saying,
"People tried to escape all the time."

03:08.965 --> 03:12.260
"But once you're committed
into Eloise, you can't leave."

03:12.302 --> 03:14.221
"You can never leave."

03:36.368 --> 03:38.787
Hello, Pia.

03:38.829 --> 03:40.580
My name is Detective Frazer.

03:40.622 --> 03:45.210
I'd like to ask you a couple
questions, if you don't mind.

03:45.252 --> 03:49.756
Some kids found the body of
this man at Eloise two days ago.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.967
In your statement, you had
mentioned a Dell Richards.

03:54.008 --> 03:55.093
Is that him?

03:59.137 --> 04:01.557
After we discovered the body,
we decided to scour

04:01.598 --> 04:03.892
the building and look
for your brother, Scott.

04:08.093 --> 04:12.492
And uh, Jacob Martin, prior statement.

04:13.247 --> 04:15.166
We did find your brother's remains.

04:15.207 --> 04:18.586
The gas explosion was so intense
that only dental records

04:18.627 --> 04:22.214
were able to make the positive ID.

04:22.256 --> 04:25.176
But we can't find Jacob Martin.

04:25.217 --> 04:26.969
During the course of my investigation,

04:27.011 --> 04:29.972
I've come across some things that are
very strange, and I'm hoping that

04:30.014 --> 04:33.392
you can help me wrap
my mind around them.

04:33.434 --> 04:39.315
This is an old case file
from a patient at Eloise.

04:41.066 --> 04:45.446
In it is Jacob Martin's
birth certificate and these.

04:57.325 --> 05:01.078
Can you explain these, Pia?

05:06.417 --> 05:08.211
Pia?

05:12.006 --> 05:13.466
Pia?

05:27.063 --> 05:29.732
All right, try again now.

05:30.983 --> 05:33.486
Yeah, that's the sound.

05:33.528 --> 05:34.570
Should be good, buddy.

05:34.612 --> 05:36.948
Jacob, you got a call inside.

05:41.035 --> 05:43.037
Yeah, Jacob here.

05:43.079 --> 05:46.249
Jacob, finally, I've been trying

05:46.290 --> 05:48.501
to reach you for a week.

05:48.543 --> 05:50.628
It's Arlen Davies, your father's lawyer.

05:50.670 --> 05:53.172
Yeah, well, I haven't spoken
to my father in years.

05:53.214 --> 05:56.217
I see, well,

05:56.259 --> 05:59.220
I hate to be the one to tell you

05:59.262 --> 06:00.555
but your father has passed.

06:00.596 --> 06:02.223
Wait, what?

06:02.265 --> 06:04.892
I realize this must be a shock.

06:04.934 --> 06:06.811
Since you are his only surviving heir,

06:06.852 --> 06:09.397
there are important details
that need to be discussed

06:09.438 --> 06:11.732
concerning the estate.

06:11.774 --> 06:15.360
The funeral's tomorrow
at Elwood Cemetery, 2:00 PM.

06:15.402 --> 06:15.987
Yeah.

06:16.028 --> 06:17.405
Perhaps we can talk afterward.

06:17.446 --> 06:19.490
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

06:19.532 --> 06:20.950
I'll be there.

06:24.745 --> 06:26.706
Who was that?

06:27.456 --> 06:29.458
Oh, nobody.

06:30.585 --> 06:33.087
You all right?

06:33.129 --> 06:37.091
Yeah... I'm fine.

06:37.133 --> 06:40.219
I just gotta go up
to Detroit for a few days.

06:40.261 --> 06:41.596
Why?

06:41.637 --> 06:43.472
My dad died.

07:01.365 --> 07:03.993
I was very sorry that
you weren't able to make it

07:04.035 --> 07:05.077
to the funeral.

07:06.519 --> 07:08.855
It was a lovely service.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.966
I realize this must be a very
emotional time for you.

07:12.207 --> 07:13.809
We haven't really spoken since he

07:13.851 --> 07:15.511
sent me to Juvie when I was 16.

07:15.553 --> 07:17.615
Well, it was the court
that sent you to Juvie.

07:17.616 --> 07:19.256
I don't need to be rude, Mr. Davies,

07:19.257 --> 07:21.257
but if you please,
just get down to bussiness here.

07:21.457 --> 07:22.710
In the last two days,

07:22.752 --> 07:25.296
I'm afraid a small
complication has arisen.

07:25.338 --> 07:27.173
There's no more money, is there?

07:27.215 --> 07:29.300
No, there's money all right.

07:29.342 --> 07:33.221
And with no siblings and no
mother, it all falls to you.

07:33.263 --> 07:39.477
And then there is an account in
the amount of $1.2 million.

07:40.719 --> 07:42.679
That's before taxes of course.

07:42.721 --> 07:45.140
Turn of the last century
your people were pretty big

07:45.182 --> 07:46.224
into real estate.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.185
What's the problem exactly?

07:48.226 --> 07:51.688
His sister, your aunt.
Genevieve Martin.

07:52.481 --> 07:54.149
What aunt?

07:55.391 --> 08:00.562
She was committed to Eloise
Insane Asylum in the late 1960s.

08:00.604 --> 08:04.650
A decade or so later it closed,
but she was never released.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.028
Most probable reason, of course,
is that she died there.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.698
So, you are still the sole inheritor

08:10.739 --> 08:12.283
with proof of her death.

08:12.324 --> 08:14.952
If we have to have her declared dead,

08:14.994 --> 08:17.413
you won't see a dime for seven years.

08:17.454 --> 08:19.248
So, where do I find proof?

08:19.290 --> 08:24.184
Well, as a happened. Eloise still
has a small administrative office.

08:24.226 --> 08:26.687
I suggest that you stop
by there tomorrow.

08:26.729 --> 08:30.733
As a relative, you can request
the records.

08:30.774 --> 08:32.735
Thank you.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.486
There's something you should know.

08:35.529 --> 08:38.456
Your father had cancer
the last three years.

08:38.498 --> 08:41.626
But, it wasn't the cancer
that killed him.

08:41.668 --> 08:47.582
When things got really bad,
he decided to take his own life.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.583
With a straight razor.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.284
I didn't know.

12:53.851 --> 12:57.271
When things got really bad,

12:57.313 --> 13:00.107
he decided to take his own life.

13:12.828 --> 13:14.622
Holy shit!

13:14.664 --> 13:17.333
What the fuck are you doing
with that razor?

13:17.375 --> 13:18.793
You scared the shit out of me.

13:18.834 --> 13:21.212
What the fuck are you
doing in a ski mask?

13:21.253 --> 13:23.255
Look, I saw the lights on,
took a chance.

13:23.297 --> 13:25.967
Look, I was fucking with you, okay?

13:26.008 --> 13:27.718
Did you hear about my old man?

13:27.760 --> 13:29.303
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:30.429 --> 13:33.432
- Don't be.
- Yo, man.

13:33.474 --> 13:35.351
Oh, you scared of a little
straight razor?

13:35.393 --> 13:37.019
Come on!

13:40.231 --> 13:41.649
What's up, man, how you doing?

13:41.691 --> 13:43.401
I'm good, man.

13:43.442 --> 13:45.319
Yeah, I can see, you're like
the GQ of delinquency.

13:45.361 --> 13:47.947
Thugs can have style, too...
thugs can have style.

13:52.576 --> 13:54.870
What can I get ya'?

13:54.912 --> 13:57.665
I will have a Last Word.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.585
Wait, if you don't know how to make it,

14:01.627 --> 14:02.837
I mean, I can show you.

14:02.878 --> 14:05.798
I'm a pretty good bartender myself.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.717
Beer is good, too.

14:07.758 --> 14:11.262
Uh... just two Atwaters, please.

14:11.303 --> 14:12.930
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

14:12.972 --> 14:15.057
Really? I'm like 30.

14:16.308 --> 14:19.311
Awe, just a baby.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.605
Sit anywhere, I'll find you.

14:27.069 --> 14:28.446
It's a tradition around here.

14:28.487 --> 14:30.906
The birthday boy buys everyone a round.

14:30.948 --> 14:31.949
Oh shit.

14:31.991 --> 14:33.325
Yeah!

14:33.367 --> 14:36.203
Really? That's a great tradition.

14:38.372 --> 14:40.833
Happy birthday. Man, I didn't
know it was your birthday.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.710
It's not, it's tomorrow.

14:45.171 --> 14:47.339
Anyway, what's up with
you, man? How's work?

14:47.381 --> 14:49.925
I've been straight for like,
what? Two years now.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.761
You've been straight for two
years? Running around with

14:51.802 --> 14:53.971
a ski mask on, huh?

14:54.013 --> 14:55.639
I got smarter, you know,
I no longer wear them

14:55.681 --> 14:56.766
in bars, you know?

14:56.807 --> 14:59.268
You evolved, that's nice, man.

14:59.310 --> 15:02.229
But you right, I'm still running it.

15:03.355 --> 15:05.024
You know...

15:05.066 --> 15:06.734
Got something hanging
over my head right now.

15:06.776 --> 15:08.611
Like what, some money shit?

15:08.652 --> 15:11.280
Come on, man, it's always a money thing.

15:11.322 --> 15:13.365
How much?

15:15.367 --> 15:16.869
20 G's.

15:16.911 --> 15:20.372
20 G's? Holy fuck, man,
what were you doing?

15:20.414 --> 15:23.042
Fuck, I'm in some deep shit, man.

15:23.084 --> 15:26.045
Well, look, I might be coming
into some money.

15:26.087 --> 15:27.797
Might be able to help you out.

15:27.838 --> 15:29.381
What, 20 G's worth?

15:29.423 --> 15:32.927
Yeah... more like 1.2 mil.

15:32.968 --> 15:34.720
- Bullshit.
- No bullshit.

15:34.762 --> 15:37.098
You just got 1.2 laying
around the house?

15:37.139 --> 15:39.141
Fucking love my white friends.
Are you serious?

15:39.183 --> 15:41.227
At least that's what I'm hearing
from my father's lawyer anyway.

15:41.268 --> 15:42.895
So, how do you get it?

15:42.937 --> 15:44.939
I have to get this death
certificate for some aunt...

15:44.980 --> 15:46.440
I didn't know I had.

15:46.482 --> 15:48.442
Her name's Genevieve.
Here take a look.

15:48.484 --> 15:51.320
She was locked away in that
mental hospital, Eloise,

15:51.362 --> 15:53.322
right outside Detroit, you know?

15:53.364 --> 15:55.032
Yeah, yeah, that place closed
down like, what, 30 years ago?

15:55.074 --> 15:56.992
It burned down, right?

15:57.034 --> 15:58.494
That's what I thought, man,
but there's still a couple

15:58.536 --> 16:00.371
old buildings there,
just a bunch of files.

16:00.412 --> 16:02.414
All I have do is swing
by there tomorrow, pick it up,

16:02.456 --> 16:03.916
piece of cake.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.377
Yo, I'm happy you're home.
Oh my God!

16:06.418 --> 16:08.712
Yeah, I bet you are. Bet you are.

16:08.754 --> 16:10.047
All right.

16:12.216 --> 16:13.509
Here you go.

16:15.636 --> 16:17.513
She's beautiful.

16:17.555 --> 16:18.681
That's my aunt.

16:18.722 --> 16:20.599
She looks familiar.

16:20.641 --> 16:23.310
Pia, some shots!

16:26.814 --> 16:29.400
Pia? That's a pretty name.

16:29.441 --> 16:31.110
Hey, what time you got?

16:31.152 --> 16:33.070
Awe, come on, man, you know
I don't carry a watch.

16:33.112 --> 16:35.739
Oh, you don't carry a watch
on you like the one you just

16:35.781 --> 16:37.032
pulled from my father's house?

16:37.074 --> 16:39.201
You profiling motherfucker.

16:39.243 --> 16:40.578
What, you want it back?

16:40.619 --> 16:43.372
Nah... all good, man.
That's you.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.333
Thanks, Anton.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.920
So, when do you get off?

16:49.962 --> 16:54.008
Jacob... good luck finding
that "Last Word" around here.

16:55.467 --> 16:57.469
Happy birthday, Jacob.

16:57.511 --> 16:59.346
Yo, it's good to see you're
still a closer, man.

16:59.388 --> 17:00.764
Fuck off!

18:07.085 --> 18:10.085
Hi, I'm looking for
administrator office.

18:16.099 --> 18:19.728
Hi.... I'm the one who called
about my aunt's records.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.939
Of course, Martin.
Come right in.

18:21.980 --> 18:22.940
Thank you. Right here?

18:22.981 --> 18:25.817
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:25.859 --> 18:27.569
Please have a seat, I'll go find them.

18:27.611 --> 18:28.987
Thank you.

18:30.822 --> 18:33.784
I noticed that painting outside.
What's the deal with that?

18:33.825 --> 18:35.953
Oh, that's actually young Eloise.

18:35.994 --> 18:39.164
They nicknamed the asylum
after her, when she was a child.

18:39.206 --> 18:40.916
Lucky kid.

18:40.958 --> 18:44.628
Mm... About 7,000 former
residents were officially

18:44.670 --> 18:47.172
buried in the cemetery but
the real number is actually

18:47.214 --> 18:48.507
ten times higher.

18:48.548 --> 18:51.718
This was not very easy to find,
believe me.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.220
But, here you are.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.471
I appreciate it, thank you so much.

18:54.513 --> 18:56.431
You're welcome.

18:56.473 --> 18:58.725
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

19:39.689 --> 19:42.066
Uh, yeah, it just says here
that it's been remitted

19:42.108 --> 19:45.653
to the Annex, per Dr. H. H. Greiss.

19:45.695 --> 19:50.116
Oh yes. The Annex is where we
keep all our nonpublic records.

19:50.158 --> 19:54.078
Sealed even to me.
You'll need a court order.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.206
Ah... and uh...
How long will that take?

19:57.248 --> 19:59.626
We could put in the request right now,

19:59.667 --> 20:04.297
we'd hear back in six or seven months...
Hopefully.

20:04.339 --> 20:10.511
Um... yeah, is there any way we
could maybe just, you know,

20:10.553 --> 20:13.097
bend the rules a little bit
on this just once?

20:13.139 --> 20:16.434
Oh no. No, no, no.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.145
But here's what I can do.

20:19.187 --> 20:22.148
Fill this out for you.

20:29.989 --> 20:32.408
J... A...

20:32.450 --> 20:34.535
Oh, Jesus.

20:53.471 --> 20:55.223
Shit.

20:55.264 --> 20:56.683
Dammit.

21:01.229 --> 21:04.107
What the fuck?

21:04.148 --> 21:05.817
Oh, my God.

21:14.993 --> 21:18.413
Oh, man... Jesus.

21:24.544 --> 21:27.171
Holy shit!

21:27.213 --> 21:30.425
Awe, you scared me, man!
Are you okay?

21:30.466 --> 21:34.137
I'm sorry I just, uh... hit your
cart here.

21:34.178 --> 21:36.139
Are you good?

21:36.180 --> 21:37.640
It should be okay.

21:37.682 --> 21:40.852
I didn't bend the wheels or anything.

21:40.893 --> 21:43.229
So... it's all here.

21:44.355 --> 21:47.233
Uh...

21:47.275 --> 21:51.070
I'm gonna get going if you're good.

21:51.112 --> 21:55.992
Um, you know... no harm, no foul.

21:56.034 --> 21:58.077
Okay, I'm going.

22:06.544 --> 22:09.172
Oh, fuck.

22:22.518 --> 22:24.518
Big day, man. Big day.

22:24.519 --> 22:27.319
Okay, I think we celebrate,
which is good news.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.120
Great fucking news.

22:29.121 --> 22:30.621
Did you get the certificate?

22:30.622 --> 22:33.122
I hate this place, man.
So fucking depressing.

22:33.123 --> 22:35.423
- Did you get the certificate?
- No, I didn't get it.

22:35.424 --> 22:37.424
Found out the file, has been
moved to some other place

22:37.425 --> 22:40.425
on property in Chita.
Court order to get to.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.426
Fucking Annex shit someone tagged.

22:42.427 --> 22:45.427
- How long this will take?
- 6 to 8 months.

22:45.428 --> 22:48.428
- Shit!
- Yeah, so...

22:48.718 --> 22:50.887
Just gotta get the court order
and see what happens.

22:50.929 --> 22:52.055
You know if we wait for the courts,

22:52.097 --> 22:53.348
you'll never get a dime, right?

22:53.390 --> 22:55.767
You want that?

22:55.809 --> 22:58.144
Can you imagine what we can
do with that money?

22:58.186 --> 23:00.105
Yo, we could start our lives over.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.649
Shit, we could start them.

23:04.526 --> 23:07.028
We have been through some
crazy shit, huh?

23:07.070 --> 23:10.657
That's the Jacob I know.
That's the Jacob I know.

23:10.699 --> 23:11.950
Any security in there?

23:11.992 --> 23:16.371
No, not really, to be honest.

23:16.413 --> 23:18.081
So, what are we waiting on?

23:18.123 --> 23:21.001
Look, people break in that
place all the time just for fun.

23:21.042 --> 23:23.628
Yeah but how are we gonna find
the fucking Annex of all places?

23:23.670 --> 23:28.216
Man, you call me crazy.
I've been doing some research.

23:28.967 --> 23:30.385
Check this out.

23:35.890 --> 23:37.183
Wow.

23:40.270 --> 23:43.732
Scott Carter... this guy's got
blueprints and everything.

23:43.773 --> 23:46.693
We get in, get the file
and get the fuck out.

23:46.735 --> 23:50.613
Yeah... let's do it.

23:50.655 --> 23:54.200
Yo, he lives on Schaefer.
That's right up the street.

23:54.242 --> 23:56.286
Well, dude, let's get
over there, come on.

23:56.328 --> 23:58.413
What are you waiting for?
Call him on the way.

23:58.455 --> 24:00.415
Oh, so now I'm your secretary.

24:19.428 --> 24:21.972
Yo, Scott!

24:22.373 --> 24:24.290
Get the lights to on!

24:26.291 --> 24:28.376
Yo, Scott!?

24:33.919 --> 24:35.421
Scott?

24:41.663 --> 24:43.748
What the fuck is all this weird shit?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.333
Holy shit.

24:55.575 --> 24:56.993
Scott!

24:58.694 --> 25:00.694
This is ain't right here.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.311
He was expecting us though, right?

25:07.353 --> 25:10.772
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.671
You know, maybe this wasn't
a good idea after all.

25:19.713 --> 25:22.382
Yo... Jake?

25:23.758 --> 25:25.510
Look at this.

25:29.347 --> 25:31.266
- Whoa!
- Shit!

25:31.308 --> 25:32.309
Really?

25:32.350 --> 25:34.853
Jesus.

25:38.106 --> 25:40.192
What up, man?

25:48.841 --> 25:50.301
So you ain't wearin' no pants.

25:52.428 --> 25:55.848
Jeez. You steal all this stuff?

25:55.890 --> 25:58.392
No... I collected it.

25:58.434 --> 26:01.229
That's a good one, I should
use that one, collected.

26:01.270 --> 26:03.648
You can use anything you want
as long as you return it.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.359
This is Dr. Greiss, known for his famous

26:06.400 --> 26:08.194
confrontational therapy.

26:08.236 --> 26:11.239
Yes, yes! Oh, do you want
to see my favorite thing?

26:13.324 --> 26:16.285
Doctor, your critics have been
extremely vocal

26:16.327 --> 26:18.704
about this radical, what do you call it?

26:18.746 --> 26:21.958
Confrontational Therapy.
Some liken it to torture.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.668
What do you say about that?

26:23.709 --> 26:25.378
I've heard it all before.

26:25.419 --> 26:27.129
What they fail to realize

26:27.171 --> 26:30.049
is that we need to confront our fears.

26:30.091 --> 26:32.426
Conquer them, not coddle them.

26:32.468 --> 26:35.263
Our deepest fears, the ones that
terrify us the most,

26:35.304 --> 26:37.515
cannot be alleviated by locking
people up and drugging them

26:37.557 --> 26:40.059
into catatonia.
It's our moral imperative

26:40.101 --> 26:42.311
to get to the root of these fears
and destroy them.

26:42.353 --> 26:44.105
Confrontational therapy does this.

26:44.146 --> 26:47.567
Yes, there are side effects,
but there are side effects

26:47.608 --> 26:49.402
with chemotherapy and surgery.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.778
We submit our patients

26:50.820 --> 26:53.447
to their phobic triggers
in a safe environment.

26:53.489 --> 26:55.741
Reprogramming them, so to speak.

26:55.783 --> 26:58.619
Eloise was the biggest asylum
in the world at one time.

26:58.661 --> 27:03.541
It had its own zip code, farm,
fire department, train station.

27:04.183 --> 27:06.685
The first X-ray machine
was developed here,

27:06.727 --> 27:08.103
tested on patients.

27:08.145 --> 27:09.855
Not you, Emma...

27:09.897 --> 27:12.816
Oh, oh, oh, do you want to
hear about the lobotomy craze?

27:12.858 --> 27:14.359
Yo, man, he's touching me.

27:14.401 --> 27:15.986
- Stop.
- Maybe not.

27:19.147 --> 27:21.982
Hey, man, come on, man, cut
the camera off, dude. Cut the camera!

27:22.024 --> 27:25.111
Look, I took out the IR filter,
so it only shoots infrared.

27:25.152 --> 27:26.987
I've been dying to try this out!

27:27.029 --> 27:28.739
I'm hoping to capture some
ghosts with it.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.866
I just recorded three seconds,
one for each of us.

27:30.908 --> 27:32.493
Good. Three seconds.

27:34.452 --> 27:35.662
Beautiful, buddy.

27:35.704 --> 27:37.956
Hey, Scott. I have
a proposition for you.

27:37.997 --> 27:42.252
How would you like to use your
camera here tonight?

27:42.293 --> 27:45.505
Uh... listen, I need to collect
some papers...

27:45.547 --> 27:47.257
Documents.

27:47.298 --> 27:50.301
Documents... on my aunt,
and they're locked away

27:50.343 --> 27:51.720
in a top secret location...

27:51.761 --> 27:53.471
- Annex.
- What?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.472
- The Annex.
- Yes.

27:55.513 --> 27:57.849
The Annex, it's on
the 5th floor of the Annex.

27:57.890 --> 27:59.726
Yeah, let's go!

27:59.767 --> 28:01.018
The Annex, the Annex,
it's on the 5th floor,

28:01.060 --> 28:02.478
I need to get permission first.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.604
No! He's gotta get permission first.

28:03.646 --> 28:05.398
But she's running away.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.442
Yes, you go in through here,

28:07.483 --> 28:10.528
then down this corridor,
up the back stairs.

28:10.570 --> 28:12.572
The administration building
is locked tight,

28:12.613 --> 28:14.449
but you can get in
through the power station.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.616
They never lock it.

28:15.658 --> 28:17.869
Oh, oh, this will be great!

28:17.910 --> 28:20.037
- This will be, an adventure!
- And he's touching me.

28:20.179 --> 28:21.388
Hey, Scotty, can you help me

28:21.430 --> 28:22.890
with the groceries, please?

28:22.931 --> 28:24.600
There's just a few more bags in the car!

28:24.641 --> 28:25.809
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

28:25.851 --> 28:29.021
- Who's that?
- I'll be back.

28:29.063 --> 28:30.481
Keep walking back slow.
Look at this.

28:30.522 --> 28:33.359
No, no, no, hell no, man.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.693
I know what you're thinking.

28:34.735 --> 28:36.612
I am not going to Eloise,

28:36.653 --> 28:39.831
with a crazy dude, jumping on
the bed like he's Daffy Duck.

28:39.973 --> 28:41.024
You know what, I'm done, dude.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.693
Look, he obviously knows all
of this shit like the back

28:42.734 --> 28:44.403
of his hand, we're golden.

28:44.444 --> 28:45.487
Rain Man's on me.

28:45.529 --> 28:46.655
Yeah, you babysit him.

28:46.697 --> 28:48.115
Okay.

28:48.156 --> 28:49.741
This is them.

28:49.783 --> 28:54.121
This is Dell. This is...
I don't know his name.

28:54.162 --> 28:55.622
What the hell are you doing here?

28:55.664 --> 28:57.457
I was just gonna ask you
the same question.

28:57.499 --> 29:00.544
I live here, he's my bro and
you've got 15 seconds

29:00.586 --> 29:02.129
before I call 911.

29:02.170 --> 29:03.672
- Whoa, whoa.
- I have friends!

29:04.923 --> 29:07.509
How did you meet them, sweetie?

29:07.551 --> 29:09.970
No, no, we found him,
we found him, all right?

29:10.012 --> 29:11.179
We just want to take a tour of Eloise,

29:11.221 --> 29:12.264
and Scott's the best person...

29:12.306 --> 29:13.640
How did you meet?

29:13.882 --> 29:15.425
- We met him on his site.
- Yeah.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.510
He's got a hot, little site @eloise.

29:16.551 --> 29:18.386
We looked him up, right?

29:18.428 --> 29:19.805
We found the site, his picture's
on there, all the information.

29:19.846 --> 29:21.431
It's great.

29:21.473 --> 29:24.768
Okay, well then,
tomorrow we can call the staff

29:24.810 --> 29:26.269
and get back to you guys.

29:26.311 --> 29:28.438
No, no, I was gonna use my new camera!

29:28.480 --> 29:29.523
He wants to use his new camera.

29:29.564 --> 29:31.024
I just said that.

29:31.066 --> 29:32.484
I need to talk to you
outside for a minute.

29:32.526 --> 29:33.610
Okay.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.612
Scotty, you stay with Dill.

29:35.654 --> 29:38.973
Jacob, no. Don't leave me...

29:40.650 --> 29:43.903
Okay, just let me start
from the beginning, all right?

29:43.945 --> 29:47.157
My father just passed away, okay?

29:47.198 --> 29:50.285
Hey, man, Jacob, man, come on, man,
y'all playing games.

29:50.326 --> 29:51.786
I wanna touch you.

29:51.828 --> 29:54.538
No, not with no pants on.
Get your pants on.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.599
And I know it's asking a lot,
but no one knows

29:57.641 --> 29:59.125
that place better than your brother.

29:59.167 --> 30:00.077
Put your pants on!

30:00.118 --> 30:02.870
I know, and he's all I've got
and I won't

30:02.912 --> 30:04.497
have him taken advantage of.

30:04.538 --> 30:05.957
He is obsessed with that place

30:05.998 --> 30:08.459
and if he wanders off
or something happens...

30:08.501 --> 30:10.836
Quick in, quick out.
I'll watch him, I promise.

30:10.878 --> 30:11.813
You'll watch him?

30:11.855 --> 30:13.857
- Yeah.
- In Eloise?

30:13.898 --> 30:17.318
I think you're gonna have your
hands full keeping up with him.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.403
- Put your head here.
- Yo, man.

30:18.444 --> 30:19.463
Put it there. Put it on!

30:19.504 --> 30:21.089
Now that you got him all riled up,

30:21.131 --> 30:23.216
it's impossible to say no to him.

30:25.451 --> 30:29.205
Okay, quick in, quick out,
and I'm coming.

30:29.247 --> 30:30.999
Yes! Thank you.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.293
Hey... Pia's in.

30:33.334 --> 30:35.837
You guys wanna see something funny?

30:35.879 --> 30:37.922
- Scott, don't!
- No.

30:37.964 --> 30:39.924
Don't!

30:40.766 --> 30:44.520
No, this will be fun,
this will be an adventure.

30:44.561 --> 30:45.430
Yeah, yeah...

30:45.471 --> 30:47.974
- It's all good.
- ...it's gonna be something.

30:48.816 --> 30:50.567
Don't look too happy about it.

30:50.609 --> 30:52.778
It's gonna be a disaster,
that's what it's gonna be.

30:52.820 --> 30:53.946
This is ridiculous.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.614
Pants!

30:57.449 --> 30:58.492
Do you need like a bag or...

30:58.534 --> 31:00.369
Bag!

31:02.454 --> 31:05.999
Has anyone ever died during
this therapy, Doctor?

31:06.041 --> 31:10.379
Medicine is not an exact science.

31:15.676 --> 31:18.011
Why is he so fascinated with this place?

31:18.053 --> 31:20.097
Careful, careful, man, careful!

31:20.139 --> 31:22.558
Our mom used to be a nurse here.

31:22.599 --> 31:25.436
She left for work one day
when I was about four,

31:25.477 --> 31:27.855
so Scotty was six.

31:27.896 --> 31:29.523
She just never came home.

31:29.565 --> 31:32.484
Never heard from her again, either.

31:32.526 --> 31:34.945
Sometimes I think Scott still thinks

31:34.987 --> 31:37.030
she's in here for something.

31:37.072 --> 31:39.825
- So, you know where we are?
- Yes... I have a map.

31:39.867 --> 31:42.453
You got a map. So, what used
to be here, anyways?

31:42.494 --> 31:44.121
It's always been this, it's a cemetery.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.123
Potter's Field, it's where they
buried the patients.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.750
The patients? You mean all this
time we walking

31:47.791 --> 31:49.668
on crazy dead people?

31:49.710 --> 31:51.587
Of course they're crazy,
it's a mental institution.

31:51.628 --> 31:54.631
Our dad went a little nuts
with Scotty needing

31:54.673 --> 31:56.800
special attention and all,
so it was pretty much

31:56.842 --> 31:58.761
up to me to look out for him
once we realized

31:58.802 --> 32:01.388
she was never coming back.

32:01.430 --> 32:04.016
That's gotta be pretty tough
for a four-year-old.

32:04.057 --> 32:07.186
Yeah, but... that's life I guess.

32:07.227 --> 32:10.439
So, what was it like living
without a mom?

32:10.481 --> 32:12.524
You have no idea.

32:12.566 --> 32:15.819
Actually I do.

32:15.861 --> 32:19.072
I barely even remember her.

32:19.114 --> 32:21.742
When she left I was probably
a little angry,

32:21.784 --> 32:24.828
so I tried to just forget all about her.

32:24.870 --> 32:26.455
What about you?

32:26.497 --> 32:29.166
Never really met her,
so I don't know what I missed.

32:29.208 --> 32:33.045
My father, he would never even
speak about her.

32:33.086 --> 32:35.339
He didn't really get along too well.

32:37.966 --> 32:41.178
Hey, y'all know we're walking
on crazy dead people, right?

32:41.220 --> 32:43.847
Oh, okay, okay, y'all in love, okay.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.943
Okay, we're gonna go in through
here and from here,

32:55.984 --> 32:57.528
we're gonna go through the power
station and from there

32:57.569 --> 32:59.238
we're gonna go to the
administration building.

32:59.279 --> 33:01.824
Hey buddy, is there uh...

33:01.865 --> 33:05.994
Is there any other way into this
situation besides... this?

33:06.036 --> 33:07.663
No.

33:07.704 --> 33:09.164
Okay.

33:09.206 --> 33:11.708
"Any other way into this situation?"

33:11.750 --> 33:14.253
How you holding up, Jacob?

33:14.294 --> 33:16.296
Okay.

33:18.507 --> 33:20.259
Oh, God.

33:23.345 --> 33:24.638
You okay?

33:24.680 --> 33:27.516
Yeah, I'm just a little claustrophobic.

33:27.558 --> 33:29.893
You know, no big deal.

33:29.935 --> 33:33.438
Everybody's afraid of something.
I don't do needles.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.023
I wouldn't say afraid necessarily...

33:35.065 --> 33:36.775
just, you know... a little
uncomfortable.

33:36.817 --> 33:40.195
- Okay.
- That's bullshit. Bullshit.

33:40.237 --> 33:43.657
I wasn't talking to you,
dipshit... fuck.

33:44.867 --> 33:47.661
- All right.
- It's okay.

33:47.703 --> 33:50.455
Here we go.

33:50.497 --> 33:51.832
Oh shit.

34:01.466 --> 34:02.968
Yo, what was that?

34:03.010 --> 34:04.386
That's the building settling.

34:04.428 --> 34:07.014
This area's famous for its sinkholes.

34:07.055 --> 34:08.724
What, are you scared?

34:08.764 --> 34:10.100
Man, hell no, I ain't scared.

34:10.141 --> 34:11.893
Ah, bullshit.

34:11.935 --> 34:13.437
Yeah, bullshit, don't tell
me that didn't scare

34:13.478 --> 34:15.688
the piss out of you just a little bit.

34:15.731 --> 34:17.357
Look at that, what's that on your pants?

34:17.399 --> 34:18.692
That's rain, dipshit.

34:18.734 --> 34:20.444
That's some pissy-ass rain.

34:20.485 --> 34:23.447
A minute ago, you was crying
about being claustrophobic.

34:23.487 --> 34:25.616
This place gives me the creeps.

34:25.657 --> 34:28.243
Thank you. Finally somebody
can admit that this place

34:28.284 --> 34:30.411
gives them the creeps.

34:30.454 --> 34:33.873
This is my favorite part.
Down here are the catacombs.

34:33.916 --> 34:36.335
This is where they used to store
the dead bodies

34:36.376 --> 34:38.295
when winter hit because it
was too cold to bury them.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.922
Enough with the dead bodies, man.

34:47.094 --> 34:49.348
Come on.

34:57.063 --> 35:01.610
Okay, these are stairs.
We have to go up 43 more.

35:01.652 --> 35:04.154
Scott, easy.

35:12.287 --> 35:14.331
Yo, what's that?

35:14.373 --> 35:18.502
The lights are on a motion
sensor. Du'h, Dell, du'h!

35:18.543 --> 35:21.171
That ain't funny.

35:34.559 --> 35:37.229
Wait, wait, stop, stop!

35:37.270 --> 35:41.608
That's her... that's Eloise.

35:47.197 --> 35:48.907
So, where the hell are we?

35:48.949 --> 35:51.994
Okay, we're here now...

35:53.954 --> 35:56.456
Do you remember?

35:56.498 --> 36:01.211
Mom... Mom used to take you
to work sometimes,

36:01.253 --> 36:03.171
do you remember?

36:03.213 --> 36:04.881
Not really.

36:04.923 --> 36:06.800
No, no, do you remember mom used
to take you to work sometimes?

36:06.842 --> 36:08.635
No.

36:16.193 --> 36:18.695
Annex is on the 5th floor
of the next building.

36:18.737 --> 36:20.781
You go through these stairs.

36:20.823 --> 36:22.241
It's not in this building?

36:22.282 --> 36:24.827
No, that's why they call it the Annex!

36:24.868 --> 36:27.454
It has very restricted access.

36:29.414 --> 36:31.333
Flashlights! Flashlights!

36:36.463 --> 36:37.589
Shh!

36:41.927 --> 36:45.389
Hold on, I think I hear something.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.641
All right, I'm pulling around.

37:02.948 --> 37:06.076
We can check back
after dinner, I'm starving.

37:06.118 --> 37:08.120
Copy that.

37:15.252 --> 37:16.712
Yo, man, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

37:16.753 --> 37:19.256
- Shh!
- That was scary.

37:19.298 --> 37:21.341
Okay, they're gone. Hey, let's
go before they come back.

37:21.383 --> 37:22.926
Come on, come on, come on! Let's go.

37:24.469 --> 37:27.556
It has very restricted access.

37:27.598 --> 37:30.517
Why is it restricted?
What else is in the Annex?

37:30.559 --> 37:33.520
The nursery, you asked what else
was in the Annex, the nursery.

37:43.405 --> 37:46.283
- Isn't this fun?
- No.

37:59.087 --> 38:01.214
This is the Annex.

38:02.549 --> 38:04.635
I've never come this far.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.812
Dr. Greiss.

38:16.939 --> 38:19.608
Mom.

38:19.650 --> 38:21.610
Maybe Mom's picture will be here.

38:21.652 --> 38:24.029
Pia, maybe Mom's picture's here!

38:26.406 --> 38:28.408
Where's mom's picture, Pia?

38:28.450 --> 38:29.910
I don't know, bud.

38:29.952 --> 38:32.037
Pia, where's mom?

38:32.871 --> 38:34.039
Mom?

38:36.249 --> 38:37.542
Mommy?

38:40.045 --> 38:41.171
Mom?

38:41.213 --> 38:42.881
Anybody know where we're going?

38:42.923 --> 38:45.258
Where are we going?

38:45.300 --> 38:47.219
There should be a hallway up here.

38:47.260 --> 38:49.012
Yes, this way, this way!

39:00.065 --> 39:03.151
These are people's ashes.

39:04.528 --> 39:07.864
- Families just left them here?
- Yeah.

39:07.906 --> 39:09.616
- Scotty, don't touch!
- Whoa, whoa!

39:09.658 --> 39:11.076
- Unh-unh.
- No, come on.

39:11.118 --> 39:12.411
Nah, man.

39:12.452 --> 39:13.996
Why?

39:14.037 --> 39:15.789
- Come on.
- Don't touch.

39:15.831 --> 39:17.582
- Let's go.
- Come one, let's go.

39:17.624 --> 39:18.875
Vending machine.

39:18.917 --> 39:21.253
It's okay.

39:27.092 --> 39:29.803
- Scott!
- Yes, Pia!

39:39.062 --> 39:40.647
Now that's just gross.

39:40.689 --> 39:42.232
- What's gross?
- Look at that, you see that?

40:06.673 --> 40:09.217
- Where we going, buddy?
- Where we at?

40:09.259 --> 40:10.761
Should be a little...

40:10.802 --> 40:14.723
A little up here around the
corner somewhere.

40:14.765 --> 40:18.560
This is it, I knew it, this is
the records room right up here!

40:18.602 --> 40:21.396
All right, watch out, on our
grand adventure.

40:21.438 --> 40:24.900
What's up with these dead birds?
Aw, shit.

40:26.318 --> 40:27.652
Fuck that.

40:27.694 --> 40:29.112
These are dead birds!

40:34.576 --> 40:36.369
Hey, wait up!

40:40.916 --> 40:44.211
Shit, how many rooms are there?

40:44.252 --> 40:46.463
Yo, look at this.

40:52.636 --> 40:55.263
Agh!

40:58.600 --> 41:01.019
Scotty, it's okay. Come on.

41:01.061 --> 41:03.605
- Aw, shit.
- Come on.

41:03.647 --> 41:06.942
Oh, my God.

41:09.319 --> 41:12.531
So they just said, fuck cleaning up.

41:12.572 --> 41:14.491
Holy shit.

41:14.533 --> 41:16.159
Right?

41:16.201 --> 41:18.537
Scotty, stay close.

41:18.578 --> 41:20.789
Jimmy Hoffa.

41:20.831 --> 41:23.125
Who shot Tupac.

41:23.166 --> 41:26.086
My ex-girlfriend's phonebook,
can't find that shit.

41:26.128 --> 41:28.046
Come on, man, how the hell
are we supposed to find

41:28.088 --> 41:30.757
a certificate in a place like this, man?

41:30.799 --> 41:32.467
Six to eight months, my ass.

41:32.509 --> 41:34.678
Yo, I'm gonna go into
another record room.

41:34.719 --> 41:36.179
Hi, pigeon!

41:36.221 --> 41:38.557
- Don't touch, buddy.
- Okay.

41:40.308 --> 41:42.352
What's your aunt's name again?

41:42.394 --> 41:45.981
Genevieve... Genevieve Martin.

41:58.535 --> 42:01.037
Buddy?

42:01.079 --> 42:03.290
See what I meant?

42:03.331 --> 42:07.043
See what I'm talking about,
hands full? I'm gonna find him.

42:07.085 --> 42:08.795
Scotty?

42:11.006 --> 42:14.217
Scott, don't play right now.

42:17.387 --> 42:19.890
Scotty, come on.

42:34.029 --> 42:37.699
Scott? Scotty?

43:01.514 --> 43:05.268
Scott, can you hear me?
Please come in.

43:31.336 --> 43:33.713
Supply closet.

43:33.755 --> 43:34.839
Gotcha, bitch.

43:37.008 --> 43:41.137
Yo, I found record room two.

43:48.103 --> 43:51.106
Dr. White, telephone.

43:51.147 --> 43:52.941
Get down!

43:52.983 --> 43:54.276
Stop!

44:14.004 --> 44:17.132
Whole lot of shit to go through.

44:17.173 --> 44:19.926
Hey, Dell, you got the time?

44:19.968 --> 44:21.845
Hey, yo, fuck you!

45:05.263 --> 45:07.640
Scotty!

46:03.905 --> 46:06.032
It's okay.

46:09.869 --> 46:12.956
Pia, any luck with Scott?

46:12.997 --> 46:14.707
No, I'm still looking.

46:14.749 --> 46:18.128
Yeah, well, really could use
some help up here.

46:18.169 --> 46:20.088
Yeah, I'm... I'm coming now.

47:20.064 --> 47:22.108
Agh!

47:31.951 --> 47:37.248
It's okay... you're okay.

48:15.620 --> 48:18.289
Scotty?

48:58.871 --> 49:01.457
What they fail to realize is,
is that we need

49:01.499 --> 49:02.709
to confront our fears.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.627
Conquer them, not coddle them.

49:36.701 --> 49:38.411
- Go ahead.
- No, no!

50:03.853 --> 50:05.313
That's me.

50:10.735 --> 50:12.111
That's me.

50:30.672 --> 50:34.217
Agh!

50:37.762 --> 50:39.639
What the hell...

50:39.681 --> 50:44.394
What's happening? Who are you?
What's happening?

50:45.728 --> 50:47.271
Hello?

50:51.567 --> 50:56.072
Jesus, Greiss is one
sadistic motherfucker.

50:56.114 --> 50:57.740
Any luck?

51:00.118 --> 51:04.747
Not really. Found the M's.
Find Scott?

51:04.789 --> 51:08.292
No, I can't find him.
I'm starting to worry.

51:08.334 --> 51:11.879
He's probably having a ball. Right?

51:11.921 --> 51:13.756
Yeah.

51:13.798 --> 51:17.218
Look, I just found the M's,
so... I'm really close.

51:17.260 --> 51:19.429
Shouldn't be too long.

51:19.470 --> 51:21.097
I can help you.

51:26.686 --> 51:28.604
Catherine...

51:31.941 --> 51:34.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I got it,
I got it! Yes!

51:34.736 --> 51:35.653
What?

51:35.695 --> 51:38.990
Genevieve Martin! Yes!

51:39.031 --> 51:42.076
Dell, Scotty, we found it.

51:42.118 --> 51:44.579
Fantastic!

52:09.353 --> 52:10.813
Died here.

52:12.815 --> 52:14.984
Hold on.

52:16.277 --> 52:17.987
So she died May 5th.

52:18.029 --> 52:20.615
Yeah, that was 30 years ago to the day.

52:21.783 --> 52:23.618
Wow.

52:23.659 --> 52:27.455
Doesn't say... doesn't say how she died?

52:31.709 --> 52:33.252
Yeah, well...

52:34.921 --> 52:39.008
Round up the troops
and go celebrate, huh?

52:39.050 --> 52:42.804
Hey... I couldn't have done this
without you and Scott.

52:42.845 --> 52:44.305
We'll find him.

52:54.440 --> 52:58.277
My watch... what the hell?

52:58.319 --> 53:00.655
What the fuck?

53:18.422 --> 53:19.340
Agh!

53:24.595 --> 53:28.808
Oh shit. What do we have here?

53:32.603 --> 53:34.897
Gotta love Codeine.

53:47.368 --> 53:50.246
Fuckin' shit, man.

54:23.029 --> 54:24.989
Y'all must be stoked.
Where's Scott?

54:25.031 --> 54:26.657
We got it!

54:26.699 --> 54:27.742
Is it hot in here?

54:27.783 --> 54:29.243
Let's get the fuck out of here.

54:29.285 --> 54:32.580
Scotty, we got what we need,
please respond.

54:32.622 --> 54:34.081
Will one of you guys try him
because he's just

54:34.123 --> 54:35.583
not listening to me.

54:35.625 --> 54:37.293
Yeah, I got him.

54:37.335 --> 54:40.421
Yo, Scott, get your crazy
ass here, man, we found it.

54:41.339 --> 54:42.840
Hey...

54:42.882 --> 54:44.383
You okay?

54:44.425 --> 54:47.136
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

54:47.178 --> 54:50.097
Are you sure? You look a little crazy.

54:53.351 --> 54:55.061
Put that bag down.

54:55.102 --> 54:57.939
You put the fucking bag down.
Shut the fuck up.

54:57.980 --> 55:03.152
Brother, hey, look at me.
No one's there. No one's there.

55:03.194 --> 55:04.487
You're telling me you don't see him?

55:04.528 --> 55:06.322
He keeps telling me to put the bag down.

55:06.364 --> 55:09.492
Hey, hey, brother, no one's there.
Look at me, it's just us!

55:09.533 --> 55:11.243
No, you see him, he's right
behind you, keep looking at me.

55:11.285 --> 55:12.151
Relax.

55:12.153 --> 55:13.549
Dude, you keep looking
at me like that, dude.

55:13.589 --> 55:16.466
Dell, we've all been seeing
crazy things, it's not real.

55:16.507 --> 55:18.176
We got the certificate,
we got the money.

55:18.217 --> 55:19.844
Snap out of it, we got the certificate.

55:19.886 --> 55:21.429
Stop fucking looking at me!

55:21.471 --> 55:23.139
- Whoa, what the fuck, man!
- Dell, stop it!

55:23.181 --> 55:24.849
- Hey, put the gun down!
- Jacob, do something!

55:24.891 --> 55:28.519
Dell? Look at me, look at me.
What happened to your hand, man?

55:28.561 --> 55:30.271
What about it?

55:30.313 --> 55:32.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at me, it's okay.

55:33.024 --> 55:35.610
Yeah, yeah, it's Jacob, it's just me.

55:35.651 --> 55:37.612
- Why's my hand bleeding.
- Just relax, it's okay.

55:37.653 --> 55:39.322
You did this?

55:39.363 --> 55:42.033
I did not do anything. It's just us.
Look at me, trust me.

55:42.074 --> 55:43.917
It's just... look at me, it's
just me, it's Jacob.

55:43.959 --> 55:44.700
- Okay.
- All right?

55:44.702 --> 55:46.496
Jacob, watch out he's right...

55:49.791 --> 55:52.001
Dell! Jacob, do something!

55:52.043 --> 55:54.712
Dell! Dell!

55:56.255 --> 55:58.382
- Dell!
- Hey, Dell!

55:58.424 --> 55:59.717
Wait, where are we?

55:59.759 --> 56:02.595
Get away from me!

56:02.637 --> 56:06.432
No, those are my glasses, I need those.
No, not my cross!

56:29.121 --> 56:31.165
Oh, no, my glasses!

56:31.207 --> 56:32.959
Gentlemen, prepare for a transorbital.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.003
No, I don't want a transorbital.
Get off me! Get away from me!

56:40.174 --> 56:42.426
Nurse, neutroplast.

56:42.468 --> 56:45.304
Get away from me! No!

56:45.346 --> 56:46.889
This is a mistake!

56:46.931 --> 56:48.683
No mistake. Strap him down, please.

56:53.396 --> 56:55.064
- Dell!
- Scott?

56:55.106 --> 56:56.691
Scott?

57:15.251 --> 57:16.919
Anesthesia, Doctor?

57:16.961 --> 57:18.796
Not necessary.

57:18.838 --> 57:20.798
If you don't remember pain,
then you never really felt it.

57:24.886 --> 57:28.472
Just calm down. In a few
minutes, you'll be a new man,

57:28.514 --> 57:30.099
and you won't remember a thing.

57:45.990 --> 57:48.326
Dr. Jones, hold that eyelid open.

58:01.255 --> 58:03.049
Hammer.

58:10.056 --> 58:11.891
Scotty!

58:26.030 --> 58:27.448
Scotty!

58:27.490 --> 58:28.824
Scott?

58:32.912 --> 58:34.330
Shit.

58:34.372 --> 58:37.792
No, no, no! Scotty!

58:37.833 --> 58:40.419
- Go, go.
- You lead the way out.

59:17.039 --> 59:18.666
Agh! Agh!

59:35.975 --> 59:38.019
Open the door!

59:41.689 --> 59:44.025
Agh! Agh!

01:00:05.087 --> 01:00:07.173
Agh! Open the door!

01:01:07.733 --> 01:01:09.485
Go down.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.156
Scotty!

01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:22.498
Okay, he should be down here.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.333
What did you say you were seeing?

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:27.002
A little girl. She was trying
to show me a box or something.

01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:30.881
Inside the nursery...
Then she just vanished.

01:01:30.923 --> 01:01:33.217
You think I'm nuts.

01:01:33.259 --> 01:01:35.719
No... yeah... well, maybe.

01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:37.972
The hole should be here.

01:01:38.013 --> 01:01:41.559
I mean... it went down some
floors, it was pretty deep.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.478
Maybe I got turned around.
Are you hearing music?

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.729
Yeah.

01:01:52.361 --> 01:01:54.697
Scotty?

01:02:04.665 --> 01:02:06.876
You're hearing that, right?

Scott? Scotty, we've been
looking for you, buddy.

01:05:16.456 --> 01:05:18.207
Hey, Scott.

01:05:18.249 --> 01:05:20.501
Hey, Scott, come back!

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.258
Hey!

01:05:28.885 --> 01:05:30.928
Scott!

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.597
Scotty, hold up!

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:39.228
Hey!

01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:17.475
Scotty, no! Scotty, no!
Scotty, why!

01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:19.685
Baby, no!

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:24.357
No, Scotty! Why? My God, no!

01:06:24.399 --> 01:06:26.776
What'd you do?

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.700
What the fuck did you do?

01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:41.624
Fucking answer me!

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:43.167
Get the fuck off me!

01:06:43.209 --> 01:06:46.129
As you can see, medicine
is not an exact science.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.049
But now it's time for your treatment.

01:06:55.721 --> 01:06:57.390
Come on, let's go!

01:07:09.077 --> 01:07:10.994
- Go, go!
- Let's go!

01:07:20.076 --> 01:07:20.669
Hey!

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:22.273
Jacob!

01:07:22.314 --> 01:07:23.858
Go!

01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:27.460
Hey, hey, stop please!

01:07:31.337 --> 01:07:32.796
Hey, hey!

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:34.797
We need help! Please, please!

01:07:34.798 --> 01:07:37.598
Somebody just attack my friend inside.
Please, we need help!

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:38.599
Hold on, hold on.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Please, we need help,
somebody will get hurt, hurry.

01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:44.101
Please stay here!
I'll be right back, stay here.

01:07:56.802 --> 01:07:58.802
Hey, thank God. Hey.

01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:03.603
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, this is some mistake.

01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:04.704
Where are the other officer?

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:07.705
- No other officer.
- No!

01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:10.706
What are you talking about?

01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:13.207
There's other officer,
go through that door.

01:08:21.608 --> 01:08:26.108
No! No, no, no. This is a mistake.
Listen to me, please!

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:31.109
The rain just stop.

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:34.910
The building is a cloak.
Everything's changed.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:36.911
When were you came outside.

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:41.511
Wait, wait, wait, I get it now.
Making it all change back to the past?

01:08:41.912 --> 01:08:44.912
- Is that what you says?
- Just sit there and shut up!

01:08:54.545 --> 01:08:56.673
Quiet down please, take your seats.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:01.135
Quiet down.

01:09:01.176 --> 01:09:03.970
We have two interesting
case studies today.

01:09:04.013 --> 01:09:09.894
This patient suffers from an
acute form of claustrophobia.

01:09:09.935 --> 01:09:12.188
The most severe and frightening
of which is specifically...

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:14.148
the fear of waking up and discovering...

01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:15.483
that you're buried alive.

01:09:15.524 --> 01:09:17.568
So, when his anesthesia wears off,

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:19.529
he'll find himself in a morgue drawer.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:23.241
Forcing him to face his ultimate fear.

01:09:23.282 --> 01:09:26.160
Perhaps you're wondering
why he's gagged.

01:09:26.202 --> 01:09:27.662
Well, when he comes to,

01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:29.330
we wouldn't want him to wake the dead.

01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:34.460
John, take him away, please.

01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:40.466
Now, this is a most interesting case.

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:45.930
There are several names for it.
Aichmophobia is one.

01:09:45.971 --> 01:09:47.348
Anyone?

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.560
Tryp... Trypanophobia.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.564
Excellent. A deathly fear of injections.

01:09:54.605 --> 01:09:56.816
A fear so strong the patient
would rather suffer...

01:09:56.858 --> 01:10:00.445
the illness than to allow its cure.

01:10:00.486 --> 01:10:04.741
This phobia has plagued us
doctors for many years.

01:10:09.704 --> 01:10:11.287
You'll notice that
the patient is gagged.

01:10:11.289 --> 01:10:13.166
What is most important to remember is,

01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:15.835
is we must not lose our resolve.

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:18.671
No matter how we feel for the
patient, we have to remember

01:10:18.713 --> 01:10:20.882
that we're helping them,
not hurting them.

01:10:20.923 --> 01:10:23.384
Nurse Fletcher will take over?

01:10:23.426 --> 01:10:26.262
As I have
a very special birth to perform.

01:11:02.173 --> 01:11:03.966
Help!

01:11:19.982 --> 01:11:22.401
Help! Help!

01:11:50.596 --> 01:11:51.931
Nurse!

01:11:53.266 --> 01:11:54.642
I got her!

01:11:57.311 --> 01:11:58.729
Stop her!

01:13:19.602 --> 01:13:21.312
Jacob?

01:13:23.314 --> 01:13:24.690
Jacob?

01:13:24.732 --> 01:13:26.525
Help! Help!

01:13:26.567 --> 01:13:27.735
Jacob!

01:13:29.028 --> 01:13:33.074
- Jacob!
- Help! Help! Help!

01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:34.617
Jacob?

01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:36.410
Help!

01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:41.415
You're okay.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:51.175
Come on.

01:13:53.803 --> 01:13:55.680
Thank you, Officer.

01:14:02.478 --> 01:14:05.314
Cover up and just try
to blend in, Jacob.

01:14:34.927 --> 01:14:36.470
East corridor...

01:14:47.106 --> 01:14:50.401
Where would they take them?
Look at the name.

01:14:56.991 --> 01:15:01.162
Oh, my God. She was...

01:15:01.203 --> 01:15:03.289
She was pregnant.

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:05.750
On your birthday.

01:15:08.294 --> 01:15:13.466
No, no, it can't be. It can't be.

01:15:21.057 --> 01:15:23.934
Oh, my God.

01:15:23.976 --> 01:15:28.731
Whoa, whoa, Jacob, you can't.
There's security everywhere.

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:41.368
It's a boy.

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:43.621
Congrats, Doc.

01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:45.414
Oh shit.

01:15:52.171 --> 01:15:54.090
Don't.

01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:56.258
- I have to.
- No, Jacob.

01:16:34.839 --> 01:16:37.216
Hi.

01:16:37.258 --> 01:16:39.468
It's Jacob.

01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:50.479
It's me... it's Jacob.

01:17:04.368 --> 01:17:07.454
Here, let's take this for the pain.

01:17:22.261 --> 01:17:23.804
Here we go.

01:17:35.816 --> 01:17:38.277
He's so beautiful.

01:17:38.319 --> 01:17:40.196
Thought of a name?

01:17:40.237 --> 01:17:41.655
Jacob.

01:17:41.697 --> 01:17:44.325
Jacob?

01:17:44.366 --> 01:17:46.952
That's a beautiful name.

01:17:48.746 --> 01:17:50.664
Sorry, I can't hear you.

01:18:00.966 --> 01:18:04.553
Don't worry, Gen, this is one
child that won't grow up

01:18:04.595 --> 01:18:07.890
in this God-forsaken place,
I don't care who his father is.

01:18:07.932 --> 01:18:10.476
I'll call your brother right now.

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:10.953
- Where'd they go?
- There.

01:19:49.783 --> 01:19:52.619
What... What the hell is she doing?

01:20:16.226 --> 01:20:18.604
Pia, come here, sweetheart.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:26.153
That was my doll.

01:20:26.195 --> 01:20:29.698
Pia, Look... look at this baby.

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.576
I'm gonna cover him up
a little bit, okay?

01:20:39.792 --> 01:20:41.877
That's my mother.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.882
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:20:57.518 --> 01:21:00.729
This is gonna be yours now.
You take good care of it.

01:21:00.771 --> 01:21:03.399
There's a gentleman waiting
outside by a car, okay.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.192
And I want you to give this box to him.

01:21:05.234 --> 01:21:07.069
He's gonna take really good care of him,

01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:08.821
make sure he gets home safely, okay?

01:21:08.862 --> 01:21:12.616
So, now go, Pia, and don't
stop for anybody. Okay?

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.044
Pia?

01:21:27.798 --> 01:21:29.299
Go on... go.

01:21:31.885 --> 01:21:33.178
Where's my son?

01:21:35.347 --> 01:21:37.891
Where's my son?

01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:50.863
Where's my son?!

01:21:52.865 --> 01:21:55.409
Find that kid.

01:21:55.451 --> 01:21:58.036
Immediate lockdown, seal all exits.

01:22:00.914 --> 01:22:03.208
All right, let's go.

01:22:17.389 --> 01:22:19.057
You wonder why I'm claustrophobic.

01:22:19.099 --> 01:22:20.684
I spent my first
full fucking day in that thing.

01:22:20.726 --> 01:22:22.060
What are you gonna do?

01:22:22.102 --> 01:22:24.438
There was a fire on this day in 1980.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.733
Now... now there's gonna
be a bigger one.

01:22:27.774 --> 01:22:31.487
Unless I missed my guess,
my uncle... no, my father

01:22:31.528 --> 01:22:34.031
is going to be pulling up
and you smuggle me

01:22:34.072 --> 01:22:37.784
out in that box you've been carrying.

01:22:37.826 --> 01:22:39.745
Okay.

01:22:39.786 --> 01:22:41.788
Here, take this and stand back.

01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:46.919
Go, go, go, stay back!

01:22:48.295 --> 01:22:52.007
Here, go! Hit the fire alarm.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.135
Come on!

01:22:57.262 --> 01:23:01.808
Clear the hospital!
Clear the hospital! This way!

01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:05.479
Let's clear the floors now!

01:23:05.521 --> 01:23:07.564
You need to exit,
everybody exit the building.

01:23:21.828 --> 01:23:23.789
Wait, Jacob, look.

01:23:33.757 --> 01:23:36.176
No, no! Jacob! No, Jacob!

01:23:36.218 --> 01:23:39.721
- No! No! You gotta go!
- Jacob! No, let me go!

01:23:39.763 --> 01:23:41.848
Somebody get him!
Somebody has to help him, please!

01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:43.475
Why won't you listen to me!

01:23:43.517 --> 01:23:45.435
Will somebody listen to me please.

01:23:45.477 --> 01:23:47.229
- He grabbed my friend.
- Lady, listen, come with me!

01:23:47.271 --> 01:23:49.773
This place has been closed down!
Come on.

01:23:49.815 --> 01:23:51.275
- There's a doctor in there!
- Listen to me! No, no doctor!

01:23:51.316 --> 01:23:54.111
Wait, no please, there's
a doctor. No, listen!

01:23:54.152 --> 01:23:57.197
He killed my brother and my
mother. Please listen to me!

01:23:57.239 --> 01:24:00.033
No doctors have been
in there for 30 years.

01:24:00.075 --> 01:24:01.118
Blanket.

01:24:01.159 --> 01:24:04.037
They tried to kill him!

01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:56.381
Pia?

01:25:01.386 --> 01:25:03.263
Okay.

01:25:06.058 --> 01:25:07.726
Okay.

01:25:09.686 --> 01:25:12.481
Well, I thought you might
like to have these.

01:25:29.498 --> 01:25:31.625
What really happened to Jacob Martin?

01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:50.686
Get anywhere?

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:01.822
He is obsessed with that place

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:04.116
and if he wanders off
or something happens...

01:26:04.157 --> 01:26:06.451
Quick in, quick out.
I'll watch him, I promise.

01:26:06.493 --> 01:26:08.954
Yo, Scott,

01:26:08.995 --> 01:26:12.582
get your crazy ass here, man,
we found it.

01:26:12.624 --> 01:26:14.626
Do you remember? Mom used to take you

01:26:14.668 --> 01:26:18.547
to work sometimes. Do you remember?
Do you remember?

01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:27.931
Pia... that's a pretty name.

01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:36.148
Pia, you take good care of it,

01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:38.859
make sure it gets home safely, okay?

01:26:50.437 --> 01:26:54.150
Oh, God... oh, God! Agh!

01:26:54.817 --> 01:26:56.777
Oh, fuck!

01:27:01.532 --> 01:27:03.701
Oh, fuck! Help!

01:27:08.831 --> 01:27:11.125
Welcome home, son.
