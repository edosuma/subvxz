00:17.550 --> 00:20.452
Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan!

00:20.553 --> 00:23.921
Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan!

02:35.455 --> 02:37.185
Yeah, of course it's frustrating.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.521
You've been planning
this for what, months?

02:39.859 --> 02:41.122
Right.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.054
Okay, did anyone take a statement?

02:44.797 --> 02:45.765
Keys?

02:45.865 --> 02:47.163
- Was there any video footage at all?
- Yeah, please.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.997
I think it's a little late to
get your deposit back, but...

02:50.370 --> 02:51.838
Honestly, that's not even
what really matters.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.165
Well, I don't know, Jim.
Maybe you could ask the guy.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.169
- So...
- Sounds about right, doesn't it?

02:56.543 --> 02:57.602
Yeah, it pulls a lot of weight.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.212
- I'm gonna try to pull an extra shift.
- Look, I get it.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.678
Do we have a physical
description of this guy?

03:00.780 --> 03:01.975
- So...
- Yeah.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.012
I won't be home for dinner and...

03:04.117 --> 03:05.608
I would tell 'em...
I would tell 'em you're walking.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.448
The starter's acting up again, so I might
have to borrow your car next week.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.522
That's what we got.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.523
It depends on when I can get it fixed.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.887
What... Did you say something, sweetie?

03:13.793 --> 03:16.661
I wrote it down.
Okay, I got to go. Love you.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.856
- Bye.
- Yeah, well, I mean...

03:17.964 --> 03:18.932
Listen, call me. I'm...

03:19.032 --> 03:21.194
I'm walking out the door right now.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.644
We're sending you
to Jordan's show in Vegas.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.240
This show is sold out.
Sold out in minutes.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.814
This is an all-access backstage pass.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.248
Meet Jordan, hang out with him
before the show,

05:18.351 --> 05:19.819
watch from the VIP area.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.582
We have Jordan Jaye on the line right now.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.156
Jordan Jaye!

05:24.257 --> 05:25.725
Hey! How's it going, Turbo?

05:25.858 --> 05:28.487
I know you don't have a lot of time,
you're about to go onstage in LA.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.893
But you're on your first world tour
for your latest album.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.396
Yeah, we're just getting started.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.165
We got three shows in Vegas, and then we
head to New York, and Europe. It's crazy.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.706
You're 17! I mean, this has got to be
the ride of your life, right?

05:39.806 --> 05:43.265
I mean, your show sold out in seconds,
you got three number one hits, and well,

05:43.409 --> 05:44.741
we've all seen your girlfriend.

05:44.877 --> 05:45.867
Well...

05:45.978 --> 05:49.845
I mean, hey, don't get me wrong,
Nikki Brown is a little too young for me.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.247
Shout-out to Tyga, by the way.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.910
But look, you want to trade places?

05:53.052 --> 05:54.042
Maybe.

05:54.153 --> 05:55.121
Sign me up.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.452
I mean, we're having a great time.
It's madness, honestly.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.957
Well, keep it going.
You're crushing it right now.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.221
We'll see you in Vegas, have a great show.

06:02.328 --> 06:03.489
Thanks, dude.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.821
Oh, my God. What?

07:04.824 --> 07:06.019
Hey, Jessica.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.588
What do you want?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.820
What do you think I want?
You ordered pizzas.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.262
Who ordered pizzas?

07:13.366 --> 07:14.425
Over here!

07:14.801 --> 07:17.771
You're an idiot. Fine. Hold on.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.050
There you go.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.462
Okay, all you, sweetheart.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.692
Buy yourself something cute.
Fix those nails, I don't know.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.993
What?

07:49.335 --> 07:50.496
Nothing. Nothing.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.868
Please. I know that look. Don't judge me.

07:53.372 --> 07:54.499
I didn't say anything.

07:54.607 --> 07:55.802
You're just jealous.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.176
Of what?

07:57.276 --> 07:59.211
Oh, my gosh.
That I have this awesome life,

07:59.312 --> 08:02.578
and I look super sick in this dress,
and you don't have any of those things.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.877
Okay, if that's what you call it...

08:04.016 --> 08:06.315
You know, I would invite you
in to come hang,

08:06.419 --> 08:10.379
but you look super busy
with your adorable little pizza route.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.017
Like I would have come anyway.

08:13.593 --> 08:14.652
You smell like pizza.

08:15.027 --> 08:15.995
Okay, whatever.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.621
Like a deep dish, meat lover's pizza.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.701
Okay. Here's your pizzas.
Have a great night. Thanks for the tip.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.367
You smell like pizza.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.469
- Thank you.
- Bye.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.665
Bye.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.642
Whatever!

10:03.069 --> 10:04.833
...last five minutes of the show.
Are you ready?

10:04.971 --> 10:05.938
Yeah.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.438
Anyway,
Alan, I just need you to call them.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.633
I need you to call them and tell them...

10:43.709 --> 10:46.144
Yes, overnights as well as ticket sales.
Alan, what did I tell you?

10:46.746 --> 10:49.045
Okay. Jordan, don't slouch.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.579
We have a full day of press tomorrow
before the show.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.287
They've added dates in Europe as well.

10:58.257 --> 11:01.558
We've also got some new tour merch we need
your approval on as soon as possible.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.993
We should have it for you by tomorrow.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.396
Just give it to me.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.124
We've also had some great PR offers.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.399
A book publisher wants to do a biography,
there's a few movie offers for cameos,

11:11.537 --> 11:14.837
and best of all, they want you to co-host
the Teen Awards.

11:15.474 --> 11:18.069
I like that idea.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.907
That would be some great exposure.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.905
Find a way to work that
into the schedule. Yeah.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.911
Co-host with who?

11:26.052 --> 11:27.111
They were thinking Nikki.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.223
The fans love to see
the two of you together, sweetheart.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.794
We're not together though anymore, Mom.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.831
Well, maybe you guys
could reunite at the awards?

11:38.931 --> 11:40.331
Now that would be huge.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.561
No. I am never dating her again.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.864
In fact, can you tell her management
to make her stop texting me?

11:46.772 --> 11:47.831
Is that it?

11:47.940 --> 11:50.409
We need you to finalize a couple more
songs for the new album

11:50.509 --> 11:51.772
before London, so...

11:52.978 --> 11:53.946
All good.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.573
Have you listened
to those samples yet, Jordan?

11:57.650 --> 11:58.879
- Kind of.
- Jordan!

11:58.984 --> 12:00.748
You know how important this is.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.754
If we don't start now, we have to
delay recording by six months.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.080
I hate the new tracks.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.181
What's wrong with them?

12:06.292 --> 12:07.555
They all sound the same.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.552
Well, what does it really matter?

12:09.695 --> 12:11.357
It's what they want.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.523
It... We've done the market research.

12:12.631 --> 12:14.930
Just pick some,
and we will handle the rest.

12:33.886 --> 12:34.876
What?

12:35.121 --> 12:36.453
Nothing.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.057
Sweetheart, we're just trying to
make it easy for you.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.761
No, I know. Just...

12:42.862 --> 12:45.991
Listen, I'll look at them again.
I promise. Just...

12:47.933 --> 12:51.199
Look, I'm really tired right now.
I'm just... I'm just gonna go lay down.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.441
Well, take your makeup off
before you go to sleep.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.305
I don't want you looking
worn out tomorrow.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.804
I know, I know.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.109
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.791
Jay! Where have you been, man?
You are missing an epic match.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.596
Dude, we were outnumbered.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.499
Yeah, it was pretty much a massacre.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.766
You're telling me the three of you
couldn't even hold your own?

14:00.873 --> 14:03.001
They were, like, really good.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.599
Don't worry, we'll get 'em next weekend.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.076
I got plans with my girl next weekend.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.202
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, come on.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.747
What, dude? Come on.

14:08.881 --> 14:12.443
This is real, okay? Whatever you have
going on next week is not.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.917
My girlfriend isn't fake, dude.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.883
Ditching us for a girl is so wrong.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.416
Are you busy all weekend?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.547
None of your business.

14:18.657 --> 14:19.989
Come on, what's the big secret?

14:20.092 --> 14:21.082
It's not a secret,

14:21.193 --> 14:23.788
but why tell you guys something you're
gonna give me a hard time about?

14:23.929 --> 14:25.454
That means it's lame.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.829
It's very lame. I'm aware of that.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.401
All right, come on. So then just tell us,

14:29.501 --> 14:31.231
and we promise we won't
give you any crap about it.

14:32.238 --> 14:36.471
Fine. So dumb. We're going to
that stupid Jordan Jaye concert.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.872
- Happy?
- Dude.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.938
My bad.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.570
Jordan Jaye? Seriously?

14:42.481 --> 14:44.950
I know. But my girl's got a thing for him.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.081
Who's Jordan Jaye?

14:47.753 --> 14:49.881
Singer guy. How do you
not know who Jordan Jaye is?

14:50.356 --> 14:52.484
I don't know. How do you know who he is?

14:53.659 --> 14:54.854
I hate that guy.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.394
No idea what my girlfriend sees in him.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.123
- Hey!
- What?

14:58.530 --> 14:59.725
A sniper.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.000
Thanks.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.228
It's 'cause he's, like, not real.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.801
I told you, he's a singer.

15:05.337 --> 15:09.206
No, I mean, he's a celebrity, right?
So he's not real.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.402
What the heck are you guys
even talking about?

15:11.510 --> 15:12.808
He's like a safety net.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.437
So when your girl is mad at you,

15:14.546 --> 15:17.710
she can pretend he's perfect and would
do everything she wishes you would do.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.114
Thank you, Doctor Drew.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.388
You're just jealous
because he's dating Nikki Brown.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.082
Which one of us are you talking to?

15:26.358 --> 15:27.553
I don't know.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.026
Who's Nikki Brown?

15:29.161 --> 15:31.096
She's hot. That's all you need to know.

15:31.297 --> 15:32.595
She's not that hot.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.768
What? You are so wrong about that.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.495
Trust me.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.423
Jordan?

16:08.767 --> 16:09.735
Yeah?

16:09.835 --> 16:11.633
We're grabbing food
before we hit the stretch to Vegas.

16:11.737 --> 16:12.830
Do you want anything?

16:12.938 --> 16:15.407
No, I'm just gonna go to sleep.
Can you wake me when we get there?

16:15.908 --> 16:17.001
Okay.

18:35.581 --> 18:39.018
Oh, my God.

18:39.518 --> 18:40.486
Crap.

18:40.919 --> 18:41.887
It's you!

18:41.987 --> 18:43.080
No, it's not.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.520
You're Jordan Jaye!

18:44.656 --> 18:46.454
Just please don't scream, okay?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.356
I'm, like, your biggest fan!

18:48.494 --> 18:50.827
No, thank you, I really appreciate that.
That's awesome...

18:51.096 --> 18:53.793
Wait, Jordan! No, wait! Come back!
Come back! No, no, no!

19:20.926 --> 19:21.894
What the...

19:21.994 --> 19:22.984
Help!

19:23.095 --> 19:24.119
I'm sorry?

19:24.363 --> 19:25.592
Wait. Do you know who I am?

19:25.697 --> 19:27.689
- What? No. I...
- Please! Let me in!

19:28.534 --> 19:29.627
No.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.260
Come on, you gotta help me out.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.895
- I don't know who you are.
- Exactly!

19:33.038 --> 19:35.098
- That's why I need your help!
- There he is!

19:38.277 --> 19:39.245
Please.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.406
All right, get in.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.439
Thank you, thank you.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.186
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:50.389 --> 19:54.019
Jordan! Jordan! Jordan! Jordan!

19:54.126 --> 19:56.823
Come back, come back,
come back, come back!

19:56.929 --> 19:59.421
Guys, we saw him! We saw him!

19:59.965 --> 20:02.196
No, I wish he would come back.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.540
Jordan?

20:46.178 --> 20:47.908
Okay. Think we lost 'em.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.175
All right, you seriously
saved my life back there.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.479
And you have some
pretty sweet driving skills.

20:57.389 --> 21:01.793
Oh, my God. You're Jordan Jaye.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.321
Oh, come on.
I thought you said you didn't know me.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.265
Well, at the time I didn't. But I know...

21:07.366 --> 21:09.164
Look, just please don't scream, okay?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.533
I'll give you anything you want.
Concert tickets?

21:11.637 --> 21:15.267
Autographs, photos? Anything you want.
Just please, don't say anything.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.408
You are unbelievable.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.946
Dude, how conceited are you?

21:21.813 --> 21:22.837
What?

21:23.482 --> 21:24.677
You're just assuming I'm a fan?

21:25.717 --> 21:26.741
Aren't you?

21:29.821 --> 21:31.653
You know what?
I don't really care who you are.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.919
So you can take your concert tickets and your
photos, and you can shove 'em right up...

21:35.027 --> 21:36.552
All right, you know what? Just...

21:36.662 --> 21:38.995
Doesn't matter. Thank you. It's...

21:39.097 --> 21:41.430
If anyone asks, forget you even saw me.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.333
- With pleasure.
- Fine.

21:43.435 --> 21:44.801
- Great.
- Okay.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.564
Whatever.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.445
Where am I?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.550
6th and Washington.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.829
Right. 6th and Washington. Got it.

22:14.733 --> 22:15.757
Is there anything else?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.261
Yeah. Can I get back in?

22:20.272 --> 22:21.535
Oh, God. Fine.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.575
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.240
Okay, so can you give me
a ride back to the tour bus?

22:30.615 --> 22:32.243
Do I look like a taxi service?

22:32.818 --> 22:34.946
No, but you look like
a pizza delivery service.

22:35.053 --> 22:37.545
So if I order pizza,
can't you just deliver me with it?

22:42.394 --> 22:43.589
Okay.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.349
Great.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.650
Why don't you just call them?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.220
Yeah.

23:12.991 --> 23:14.755
This is so weird.

23:15.627 --> 23:16.651
What?

23:17.095 --> 23:18.654
This has never happened before.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.023
What, you've never been on your own?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.225
I mean, no, not that. I mean, just...

23:23.735 --> 23:26.398
They probably have no idea
that I'm not on the bus.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.701
Usually they always know where I am.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.140
Well, congrats on having
a new life experience.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.271
I'm sure it'll be just thrilling for you.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.848
So are you gonna call them or not?

23:44.823 --> 23:47.816
No. Actually, no, I'm not.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.620
Why not?

23:49.861 --> 23:53.263
I mean, they're already on their way
to Vegas. My mom's probably asleep.

23:53.732 --> 23:57.794
What's the point? I can probably
just get a flight tomorrow or something.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.438
Must be nice.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.632
Yeah.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.673
So what, do you want me to take you
to a hotel or something?

24:05.043 --> 24:06.705
Hotels can be pretty tricky.

24:06.812 --> 24:10.472
Once they know who I am,
word gets out, that's just a pain.

24:10.582 --> 24:11.880
Plus, I don't have my security.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.777
Right.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.149
Yeah.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.687
So where do you want me to take you?

24:19.424 --> 24:20.824
Well, don't you live around here?

24:21.393 --> 24:22.588
Yeah, why?

24:25.630 --> 24:26.654
No!

24:26.765 --> 24:29.132
Come on, why not?

24:29.234 --> 24:32.261
Are you insane? I'm not gonna
bring you home with me.

24:32.370 --> 24:35.306
Come on, I got to sleep somewhere.
I can crash on your couch.

24:36.575 --> 24:38.203
What am I gonna tell my parents?

24:38.443 --> 24:40.071
You don't tell your parents.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.613
Even better.

24:41.947 --> 24:44.314
Come on, they'd insist on
calling my mom or whatever.

24:44.816 --> 24:45.806
It's too awkward.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.113
And sneaking you into my bedroom
late at night isn't?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.381
I'll pay you.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.184
$100.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.324
$200.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.517
I said no!

24:53.625 --> 24:56.754
$500. $500 cash, I'll be gone first thing.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.955
Come on, you could obviously
use the money.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.094
Excuse me?

25:03.535 --> 25:04.559
You deliver pizzas.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.405
So?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.269
So, I assume it's not for fun.

25:08.373 --> 25:12.902
Come on, $500 cash,
I'll be gone first thing. What do you say?

25:18.016 --> 25:18.984
One night.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.074
I'll be gone by morning.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.082
And you sleep on the floor.

25:23.788 --> 25:26.952
Perfect. So, do we have a deal?

25:28.727 --> 25:29.786
Deal.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.185
I'm Jordan.

25:31.296 --> 25:32.355
Emily.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.523
Emily.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.323
So...

25:36.301 --> 25:37.291
What now?

25:37.802 --> 25:39.395
Well, my shift's almost over,

25:39.504 --> 25:42.406
but it's gonna be hours
before my parents go to bed.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.100
So we're gonna have to kill some time.

25:44.910 --> 25:45.934
Okay.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.102
So...

25:48.680 --> 25:49.773
What do you want to do?

25:50.081 --> 25:51.743
You tell me,
you're the one who lives here.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.645
I don't know.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.781
I mean, do you know any places
where I won't get recognized?

26:12.137 --> 26:13.127
All right.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.106
It's on like Donkey Kong.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.214
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:24.683 --> 26:25.742
All right.

26:28.853 --> 26:29.946
Why does it keep going left?

26:31.222 --> 26:32.747
So good. It's crazy.

26:32.857 --> 26:35.588
It's been like 10 years,
cut me some slack.

26:35.694 --> 26:36.684
All right.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.534
Okay. Looks like you come here often.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.108
- I didn't see it. I didn't see it.
- Okay.

26:53.211 --> 26:54.509
All right, all right. Round two.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.114
- Round two, here we go.
- Let's see.

27:05.056 --> 27:06.354
I think I'm being hustled.

27:23.241 --> 27:26.370
So I'm guessing bowling really
isn't the popular sport around here.

27:26.678 --> 27:30.547
Yeah, definitely not.
It's... It's why I like it.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.341
What do you mean?

27:34.586 --> 27:38.114
It's just nice to have someplace
to get away. You know?

27:38.223 --> 27:40.590
Someplace that's just yours.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.287
Don't have to deal
with people and all their stuff.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.159
All right, I can feel that.

27:46.898 --> 27:49.834
So, what about you?

27:49.934 --> 27:51.869
What do you like to do for fun?

27:53.104 --> 27:55.767
I don't know. Video games, I guess.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.501
You know, I'm mostly working,
so I don't get to go out much.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.912
How is that possible?

28:03.615 --> 28:05.811
I mean, you... You're a celebrity.

28:07.285 --> 28:08.344
So?

28:08.453 --> 28:12.356
So I'm pretty sure that means
you can do whatever you want.

28:12.457 --> 28:15.621
It's not as easy as it looks, trust me.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.130
Come on. It really can't be that bad.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.695
All right, well,
not necessarily bad, just...

28:22.801 --> 28:24.827
I don't know, I started performing
when I was really young.

28:24.936 --> 28:27.371
Singing, auditioning, taking classes.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.270
I had a manager when I was eight.

28:29.374 --> 28:33.004
So that doesn't really leave time
for me to do, you know, normal stuff.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.271
Right.

28:34.412 --> 28:37.382
Well, did you want to do all that,

28:37.482 --> 28:40.884
or were you, you know,
like, forced into it?

28:40.985 --> 28:41.975
No, I wanted it.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.750
Like, I definitely wanted it.

28:44.856 --> 28:47.951
And you know, my mom
was a little reluctant at first,

28:48.059 --> 28:50.688
but I practically begged her
every single day,

28:50.795 --> 28:53.890
and she eventually made it happen for me.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.835
Well, that's nice.
That she cared that much.

28:58.136 --> 28:59.104
Oh, yeah.

29:00.171 --> 29:02.538
My career is her whole life.

29:02.640 --> 29:06.475
So I can never really complain. You know?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.275
I'm the kid that's gotten
everything he's ever wanted,

29:09.414 --> 29:12.407
You know, not many people can say that.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.746
Yeah, that's for sure.

29:17.555 --> 29:18.784
Enough about me, though. What about you?

29:21.626 --> 29:22.650
What about me?

29:22.961 --> 29:25.624
I mean, all I know is that, you know,
you're in high school,

29:25.730 --> 29:28.131
you live with your parents,
and you deliver pizzas.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.228
Oh, don't forget about all the bowling.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.636
Yes. Never forget about the bowling.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.435
But seriously, what's your story?

29:37.709 --> 29:38.733
I don't have a story.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.675
Come on. Everybody has a story.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.470
Not really. No.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.075
Family?

29:45.517 --> 29:46.746
Two parents, only child.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.047
Friends?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.952
Well, I'm in high school. So...

29:52.924 --> 29:54.688
Unless I want to get wasted every weekend

29:54.793 --> 29:57.353
and see how many guys I can hook up with,

29:57.462 --> 30:00.330
yeah, my options are pretty limited.

30:00.431 --> 30:03.026
Okay. Movie? Favorite movie?

30:04.068 --> 30:05.036
I prefer reading.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.194
Okay, favorite book?

30:08.439 --> 30:09.407
Who can pick only one?

30:09.574 --> 30:12.203
Oh, my God.
Now you're just being stubborn.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.906
No, not really.

30:16.381 --> 30:20.477
Look, not everyone started working
when they were eight.

30:21.085 --> 30:24.055
It's... It's great that you have
it all figured out for yourself,

30:24.155 --> 30:26.852
but don't assume everyone else does.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.728
Nobody has it all figured out. Believe me.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.151
Go through my window,
it's the second one. I'll let you in.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.380
Okay.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.646
This is awesome.

32:35.820 --> 32:37.311
Is this yours?

32:37.622 --> 32:38.920
Yeah.

32:40.224 --> 32:41.954
Okay, I am impressed.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.787
It's really not that good.

32:45.596 --> 32:46.825
Oh, come on.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.528
I'm still working on it.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.530
What do you mean, you don't have a story?

32:53.504 --> 32:56.406
I don't know. You know
what it's like to put your art out there.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.238
I do not make art.

33:01.746 --> 33:04.215
Let me just grab you
a blanket and a pillow.

33:07.085 --> 33:10.078
So is this what you want to do?

33:10.555 --> 33:11.716
Yeah.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.622
I got accepted into
a bunch of art schools.

33:15.193 --> 33:19.028
It's not cheap. I've been saving forever,
but I still need a scholarship,

33:19.364 --> 33:20.696
which is kind of complicated.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.226
Why?

33:22.600 --> 33:26.901
It all depends on my portfolio.
It's not just about technique.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.864
Kind of art I'm into,
it's a little hard to show.

33:30.274 --> 33:31.264
How so?

33:31.376 --> 33:32.503
You got plenty around here.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.778
So this is street art, right?

33:39.183 --> 33:41.118
My room doesn't count.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.779
I mean, the whole point
of this style is to take

33:43.888 --> 33:49.691
everyday objects like walls and settings,
and change them.

33:50.561 --> 33:53.861
You know, make art
a part of everyday life.

33:53.965 --> 33:57.163
Not just stuck in a museum

33:57.268 --> 33:58.395
or a gallery.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.160
That's really cool.

34:00.304 --> 34:02.637
Yeah, except for the part
where it's illegal.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.134
I live in a small town,
and my dad's a cop.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.007
Kind of limits my options.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.576
I...

34:15.920 --> 34:17.513
I need to get changed.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.454
Oh, right. I'll just turn around.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.150
No, you can go in there.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.088
The closet, like right there?

34:25.196 --> 34:26.562
Yeah. That'd be great.

34:26.664 --> 34:27.791
That works, too.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.728
- Just...
- Yeah.

34:36.808 --> 34:37.900
Nice closet.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.275
Sorry.

34:42.513 --> 34:44.812
I've never had a boy in my room, okay?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.681
Let alone a celebrity. It's kind of weird.

34:47.784 --> 34:50.687
Well, congrats on having
a new life experience.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.757
Okay, you can come out now.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.835
You... You good?

35:05.136 --> 35:06.229
Yep.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.719
Hey. You awake?

35:25.056 --> 35:26.285
Yeah.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.658
What's wrong?

35:32.263 --> 35:33.595
Nothing.

35:37.502 --> 35:38.834
I can't sleep.

35:40.204 --> 35:41.365
Seriously?

35:41.873 --> 35:42.966
Can you?

35:45.376 --> 35:46.469
No.

35:47.578 --> 35:48.637
I know, right?

35:50.081 --> 35:51.208
Sometimes...

35:53.584 --> 35:56.918
Sometimes when I can't sleep,
I like to just...

35:58.089 --> 35:59.523
Listen to the quiet.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.393
It's like the whole world stops

36:07.832 --> 36:10.597
just a few hours.

36:10.701 --> 36:12.169
Like...

36:13.437 --> 36:15.167
Like time is frozen.

36:16.774 --> 36:18.072
Yeah.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.306
Gets me thinking.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.342
About what?

36:25.650 --> 36:26.743
Life.

36:27.919 --> 36:31.117
Like how...

36:34.125 --> 36:35.718
I don't know.

36:37.562 --> 36:39.258
How nothing is really real.

36:42.433 --> 36:46.200
Who we are, who people think we are...

36:48.839 --> 36:50.705
How it just seems so fake.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.476
'Cause at the end of the day...

36:57.915 --> 37:00.475
It doesn't really matter, you know?

37:06.457 --> 37:08.358
I know that doesn't make any sense.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.495
No, I get it.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.465
My whole life is like that.

37:15.233 --> 37:19.102
People always tell me what to wear,
and what to do, and say.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.199
All day, every day.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.668
And somebody is always watching.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.640
I always have to be careful, you know.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.685
So this is the only time
that's really mine.

37:37.855 --> 37:39.653
Maybe that's why I can't sleep.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.999
Yeah. I mean...

37:51.802 --> 37:54.795
Just the other day you were
this guy on the radio.

37:56.140 --> 38:00.874
Now you're lying on my floor...

38:03.314 --> 38:06.011
And that should be weird, but it's not.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.216
Not really.

38:13.391 --> 38:15.792
'Cause at the end of the day,
you're just a guy.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.159
Gee, thanks.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.724
You know what I mean.

38:23.501 --> 38:24.935
Yeah, I do.

39:47.282 --> 39:48.944
What the heck?

39:50.018 --> 39:51.213
Oh, my God.

39:52.154 --> 39:53.554
It wasn't a dream.

39:56.058 --> 39:57.390
Where am I?

39:57.760 --> 39:59.092
My bedroom floor.

39:59.495 --> 40:00.519
Your bedroom?

40:01.797 --> 40:05.461
Right. God, you scared the heck out of me.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.129
Then we're even.

40:10.005 --> 40:10.995
Hi.

40:12.174 --> 40:13.267
Hey.

40:14.009 --> 40:15.068
Wait, crap. What time is it?

40:15.177 --> 40:16.406
I don't know. Maybe like 8:00?

40:16.678 --> 40:17.907
I got to call my mom.

40:18.614 --> 40:20.082
Yeah, and we got to get you
out of my house.

40:20.182 --> 40:21.445
Do you think your parents are awake yet?

40:21.550 --> 40:22.711
Definitely.

40:23.051 --> 40:24.451
What are we gonna do?

40:27.656 --> 40:29.386
Let me get changed. I have an idea.

40:29.491 --> 40:30.550
Okay.

40:35.697 --> 40:39.293
Yeah. I know,
she's a real firecracker, that one.

40:40.602 --> 40:42.628
Yeah, I told her green and she went white.

40:45.340 --> 40:46.535
She's a funny one.

40:47.976 --> 40:50.878
Go out the window and be quiet.
I'm gonna distract them.

40:52.047 --> 40:53.845
No, I didn't get that from her.

40:55.017 --> 40:56.679
I think they said France, but...

40:57.820 --> 40:59.288
I don't know.

40:59.922 --> 41:00.889
Hey.

41:00.989 --> 41:04.391
Yeah, I just... I just have no clue which
direction she's gonna go with that.

41:04.526 --> 41:05.653
Good morning.

41:06.094 --> 41:07.062
What?

41:07.196 --> 41:09.597
Trish, hang on one second.
Honey, do you want some oatmeal?

41:10.899 --> 41:13.095
No. I... No.

41:14.603 --> 41:15.969
What are you guys doing today?

41:19.041 --> 41:20.009
Hello?

41:21.176 --> 41:22.337
What?

41:23.178 --> 41:25.010
Really?

41:26.081 --> 41:28.016
When was the last time
we had a real conversation?

41:28.750 --> 41:30.742
Or had a meal together,
or talked about anything

41:30.853 --> 41:33.322
other than what we had to do that day?

41:33.422 --> 41:35.653
I mean, when was the last time
that I saw you

41:35.757 --> 41:37.692
without your phone glued to your hand?

41:38.694 --> 41:40.720
It's just work, you know this.

41:41.930 --> 41:45.128
I mean, in, like, six months, I am gone.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.493
I leave for college.

41:47.603 --> 41:50.198
And who knows how much
we'll see each other after that.

41:50.772 --> 41:53.765
So you can decide what's important.

41:54.142 --> 41:56.976
Just think about it, okay?

42:04.286 --> 42:05.754
What do you think that was all about?

42:14.796 --> 42:16.162
Do you want some oatmeal?

42:20.068 --> 42:21.092
That was awesome.

42:21.503 --> 42:22.471
I'm horrible.

42:22.571 --> 42:25.439
No, you're not.
You told the truth. It was inspiring.

42:26.475 --> 42:28.501
I've never spoken to them
like that before.

42:28.777 --> 42:32.737
I mean, was it for distraction,
or did you mean it?

42:34.016 --> 42:35.075
Both.

42:35.183 --> 42:37.084
Okay, so you have
nothing to feel bad about.

42:37.586 --> 42:40.420
Yeah, well, let's not waste it.
We got to get you to the airport.

42:40.923 --> 42:42.050
Yeah, about that.

42:43.492 --> 42:44.516
What?

42:44.626 --> 42:46.117
Well, my show isn't till tomorrow night,

42:46.228 --> 42:48.720
so technically
I don't have to fly out today.

42:49.765 --> 42:53.258
So what, you just want to stay here?

42:53.535 --> 42:55.834
Well, I mean, I didn't plan all of this.

42:55.938 --> 42:57.964
It's just... I actually kind of like it.

42:58.540 --> 43:00.372
It's kind of like a little vacation.

43:00.509 --> 43:02.808
Hanging out at a bowling alley
and sleeping on my floor.

43:03.178 --> 43:07.445
I mean, no managers, no security,
no press, no screaming fans.

43:07.549 --> 43:08.573
Fair enough.

43:08.684 --> 43:10.676
This is the most normal
I've felt in years.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.482
So what do you say? Got any plans?

43:15.190 --> 43:16.180
Me?

43:17.492 --> 43:18.755
Not really.

43:18.860 --> 43:20.123
Well, then, do you want to hang?

43:21.730 --> 43:23.096
Sure, I guess.

43:23.498 --> 43:24.466
Awesome.

43:24.566 --> 43:25.829
There's one thing I got to
take care of real quick,

43:25.934 --> 43:27.493
and then we're good to do whatever.

43:28.303 --> 43:29.396
What's that?

43:30.505 --> 43:33.134
And then this morning, I thought
maybe he went out for breakfast,

43:33.241 --> 43:34.436
but then he hasn't come back.

43:34.543 --> 43:37.274
And I can't imagine that he would
decide now in his life to take off,

43:37.379 --> 43:41.009
when he's a major superstar,
and that's why I'm so concerned...

43:42.584 --> 43:43.552
Hello?

43:43.652 --> 43:44.813
- Hey, Mom.
- Jordan?

43:46.688 --> 43:47.747
Yeah, it's me.

43:47.856 --> 43:49.119
Are you all right?

43:49.558 --> 43:51.117
Yes, I'm fine. Everything's okay.

43:52.494 --> 43:56.454
What happened? You just disappeared.
Your GPS is off. What...

43:56.565 --> 43:57.828
I know. I turned it off.

43:58.066 --> 43:59.295
What? Why?

43:59.534 --> 44:01.435
Look, I'll explain everything later.

44:01.536 --> 44:03.232
I'll fly back in tomorrow,
just in time for the show.

44:03.338 --> 44:04.966
No, no. That is unacceptable.

44:05.073 --> 44:06.336
- You do not get to...
- Relax, okay?

44:06.441 --> 44:08.672
I said I'm fine. I'll check in later.

44:09.244 --> 44:11.372
Jordan, don't you dare. You need...

44:13.915 --> 44:15.042
How'd she take it?

44:16.785 --> 44:18.651
As well as could be expected.

44:23.425 --> 44:26.293
He's okay. He's okay, everybody.
He's okay.

44:26.395 --> 44:27.488
Officer, thank you for your time.

44:27.596 --> 44:31.363
Apparently, my son has taken off
and we'll see him tomorrow.

44:33.802 --> 44:34.792
Want to grab some food?

44:35.103 --> 44:36.366
Yeah. I could eat.

44:36.705 --> 44:38.105
Come on. My treat.

44:38.940 --> 44:42.138
But first, I feel like
I should get new clothes.

44:44.146 --> 44:45.170
Yeah.

45:09.404 --> 45:11.373
Oh, my God. I can barely recognize you.

45:11.907 --> 45:13.808
Yeah, well, that's my image.

45:14.976 --> 45:16.035
Why?

45:16.244 --> 45:19.112
Well, because for some reason,
teenage girls seem to like it more.

45:19.347 --> 45:21.816
And that's who buys my albums
and my tour tickets.

45:23.185 --> 45:24.483
Well, I don't get it.

45:25.487 --> 45:28.389
That right there
is how I got caught last night.

45:28.490 --> 45:30.959
I was just standing here when
some girls happened to come by.

45:31.359 --> 45:34.852
Are you serious?
Oh, my God. That's perfect.

45:34.963 --> 45:35.987
What?

45:36.098 --> 45:38.124
Poor things were probably so confused.

45:38.433 --> 45:40.834
Hey, don't talk about my fans
like they're idiots.

45:40.936 --> 45:43.997
And don't say that they're idiots
because they like me.

45:45.340 --> 45:49.573
Fine. But I will point out
that you literally ran away from them.

45:49.978 --> 45:54.473
Oh, come on.
They were just a little too enthusiastic.

45:54.583 --> 45:57.052
Sometimes they don't understand
the concept of personal space.

45:57.152 --> 45:59.883
It's because they feel like
they know the real me.

45:59.988 --> 46:01.012
Is that weird?

46:01.123 --> 46:02.216
What?

46:02.324 --> 46:04.725
People, like, these random strangers

46:04.826 --> 46:06.454
acting like they know
everything about you.

46:06.561 --> 46:08.120
Intimate detail.

46:08.230 --> 46:11.199
Oh, yeah. Definitely weird.

46:11.299 --> 46:14.394
They feel like they know
the real Jordan Jaye, but they don't.

46:14.503 --> 46:18.702
Just what some press agent decided
was good for my image, AKA not me.

46:20.876 --> 46:22.037
Really?

46:22.144 --> 46:23.442
Really.

46:26.181 --> 46:31.552
Okay, favorite color.
Is it A, blue, B, green, or C, orange?

46:34.055 --> 46:36.889
I guess, A, blue.

46:38.660 --> 46:43.462
Sorry. The correct answer is C, orange.
Like a sunset.

46:44.065 --> 46:45.363
"Like a sunset"?

46:45.867 --> 46:47.460
I don't know where
they get this stuff from.

46:47.669 --> 46:49.604
Well, if Jordan Jaye is one thing,
it's romantic.

46:50.405 --> 46:51.498
Yeah, next.

46:51.740 --> 46:52.764
Okay, here's the big one.

46:52.874 --> 46:54.035
It's the final question.

46:54.142 --> 46:56.077
"What is Jordan Jaye's favorite movie?"

46:56.178 --> 47:01.879
Is it A, The Avengers,
B, Maze Runner, or C, The Notebook.

47:03.552 --> 47:06.181
I'm gonna have to go
with D, none of the above.

47:06.288 --> 47:07.813
Sorry, that's not an option. Try again.

47:08.690 --> 47:10.818
Please tell me it's not C.

47:13.094 --> 47:14.187
I can't do that.

47:15.030 --> 47:16.157
Wow.

47:16.298 --> 47:19.735
So according to the Jordan Jaye
compatibility quiz, you are...

47:20.468 --> 47:21.663
"Strangers in the night.

47:21.770 --> 47:23.170
"You have nothing in common."

47:24.439 --> 47:25.907
- Is that what it says?
- Yeah.

47:26.041 --> 47:27.407
What are the other choices?

47:29.044 --> 47:31.513
"Facebook friends,"
and "Match made in heaven."

47:32.047 --> 47:33.310
Yeah, I feel dirty.

47:33.782 --> 47:35.580
You're right, though,
they know nothing about you.

47:35.984 --> 47:36.974
Told you.

47:41.489 --> 47:42.548
- What?
- No!

47:42.657 --> 47:43.681
- What?
- Get under the table.

47:43.792 --> 47:45.454
- What was that for?
- Do it! Now!

47:45.560 --> 47:47.085
- What are you... What, now?
- Yes!

47:48.730 --> 47:49.789
God!

48:07.249 --> 48:08.478
What is your problem?

48:09.017 --> 48:10.041
Nothing.

48:10.151 --> 48:12.450
Really? Then can you please
stop staring at me and my friends

48:12.554 --> 48:14.386
with your judgy look all over your face?

48:14.756 --> 48:17.225
Don't flatter yourself.
What are you doing here, Jessica?

48:17.325 --> 48:18.987
You don't own the place, Emily.

48:19.661 --> 48:22.096
Well, no, but I didn't think
you came here anymore.

48:22.664 --> 48:24.826
Why wouldn't I come here? It's adorable.

48:25.367 --> 48:27.393
I don't know, it's not
the popular place to hang out.

48:27.502 --> 48:30.870
There's no one to show off to.
Thought that's all that mattered to you.

48:32.274 --> 48:33.742
You are pathetic.

48:33.842 --> 48:37.142
Sitting there, thinking that you are just
so much better than everyone else.

48:37.312 --> 48:38.974
Well, at least I don't pretend
to be someone I'm not.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.072
Well, at least people know
I actually exist.

48:41.583 --> 48:43.677
God, do you really think
that you're gonna just go to New York

48:43.785 --> 48:45.014
and be this, like, great artist?

48:45.120 --> 48:47.282
'Cause that's hilarious.

48:47.389 --> 48:49.324
Hilarious. Because you're a nobody.

48:49.424 --> 48:51.689
And you will be a nobody
no matter where you go.

48:51.793 --> 48:53.887
So I'm gonna come here whenever I want,

48:53.995 --> 48:54.985
and if you don't like it,

48:55.096 --> 48:57.224
how about you go find
somewhere else to judge people from?

48:57.332 --> 48:58.300
Okay.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.301
Yeah. Lot of calories
on that table, Emily.

49:00.402 --> 49:01.392
Lot of calories.

49:08.209 --> 49:09.507
Okay, she's gone. Get up.

49:14.215 --> 49:15.308
Friend of yours?

49:15.450 --> 49:17.043
Yeah, believe it or not, she used to be.

49:17.385 --> 49:20.549
Gosh.
So what's with all the hostility, then?

49:21.923 --> 49:23.619
She wanted to be popular.

49:23.725 --> 49:26.285
I didn't care. She changed,
wanted everyone else to like her,

49:26.394 --> 49:28.761
and when I didn't, she dropped me.

49:31.599 --> 49:33.795
Now I get why you want to
get out of here so bad.

49:33.902 --> 49:35.063
Yeah. You know what?

49:35.170 --> 49:36.968
Let's get you out of here
before someone recognizes you.

49:37.072 --> 49:38.540
Maybe there's like
a back door or something.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.302
Or, we could just do this.

49:41.376 --> 49:42.400
What are you doing?

49:43.078 --> 49:44.444
I got this. I got this.

49:50.719 --> 49:52.153
Hi. I'm Jordan Jaye.

49:54.622 --> 49:56.557
Yeah, I know.

49:57.926 --> 49:59.895
Great. That'll save us some time.

50:00.195 --> 50:01.925
Okay, so here's the thing.

50:02.030 --> 50:03.862
I happened to see some of
Emily's artwork on Instagram,

50:03.965 --> 50:05.695
and I was just blown away.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.701
You don't see that type of talent
every day, am I right?

50:08.036 --> 50:09.026
Of course I'm right.

50:09.137 --> 50:11.470
Anyway, I came here
hoping to convince her to, you know,

50:11.573 --> 50:13.098
design my next album cover.

50:13.208 --> 50:14.870
But apparently, she's not a fan.

50:14.976 --> 50:17.605
Doesn't want to
"compromise her artistic integrity."

50:17.712 --> 50:19.180
But, you being a friend of hers,

50:19.280 --> 50:20.976
I was hoping you might
want to help convince her.

50:21.082 --> 50:22.345
What do you say?

50:24.285 --> 50:26.254
Can I see that? Thank you.

50:26.354 --> 50:29.085
Wouldn't want to be getting sued, huh?
Come on, we're leaving.

50:29.190 --> 50:31.819
What? What?
Come on, I was making a friend.

50:34.896 --> 50:38.628
Was that... Why was he... That was...

50:42.637 --> 50:44.003
What the heck were you thinking?

50:44.105 --> 50:45.869
What? She deserved it.

50:46.241 --> 50:47.539
I thought you wanted
to keep a low profile.

50:47.642 --> 50:49.372
Now everyone's gonna know you're here.

50:49.477 --> 50:51.241
Oh, come on. Who's gonna believe her?

50:51.346 --> 50:53.747
And if they do,
I'll be long gone by then, relax.

50:54.449 --> 50:56.577
You're... You're unbelievable.

50:56.684 --> 50:58.277
Come on. You're welcome.

50:58.386 --> 51:00.651
And besides, don't listen to her.

51:00.755 --> 51:02.053
Come on, your stuff is great.

51:02.157 --> 51:04.592
More people need to see it. Not someday,

51:04.759 --> 51:07.160
not in college, right here, right now.

51:08.897 --> 51:10.593
Let's tag the school tonight.

51:12.834 --> 51:13.824
What?

51:13.935 --> 51:16.905
No! No, I'm not gonna
break into my own school.

51:17.005 --> 51:19.668
Come on, come on.
Let's make 'em eat their words.

51:20.642 --> 51:23.043
You... You are crazy.

51:23.144 --> 51:24.612
Just crazy enough.

51:26.681 --> 51:27.649
Come on.

51:27.749 --> 51:29.081
How would we even get in?

51:29.484 --> 51:30.543
I'll take care of it.

51:31.019 --> 51:32.009
What if we get caught?

51:32.120 --> 51:33.281
We won't get caught.

51:34.656 --> 51:37.455
Come on, live a little.
Isn't that what art's all about?

51:37.659 --> 51:39.355
Real life, real emotions.

51:39.461 --> 51:40.588
Well, this is it.

51:40.695 --> 51:42.323
Come on, let's be in this moment.

51:42.430 --> 51:43.454
What do you say?

51:47.368 --> 51:48.768
Okay, we're gonna need supplies.

51:49.237 --> 51:51.069
Great, there you go. There you go.

51:53.475 --> 51:54.442
Look for spray paint.

51:54.542 --> 51:55.635
Gotcha.

52:22.203 --> 52:23.432
Yeah, it would look great.

52:24.572 --> 52:25.596
This would be a good idea.

52:25.707 --> 52:26.674
Oh, yeah.

52:26.774 --> 52:29.073
- So we don't die.
- Good thinking. I think so.

52:42.323 --> 52:43.291
They saw me.

52:44.125 --> 52:45.149
Come on, let's go.

53:34.142 --> 53:36.202
So, your parents aren't around much, huh?

53:36.978 --> 53:38.708
No. Not really.

53:39.647 --> 53:41.275
That a good thing or a bad thing?

53:43.384 --> 53:46.115
Neither. I don't know.

53:46.788 --> 53:50.884
They're not bad parents,
they're just busy.

53:53.094 --> 53:55.996
Must be nice. My mom is always around.

53:57.098 --> 53:58.225
Why?

53:58.333 --> 53:59.528
She's my manager.

54:01.069 --> 54:02.469
Like a mom-ager?

54:02.570 --> 54:03.731
Exactly.

54:05.273 --> 54:06.468
I don't know.

54:06.574 --> 54:09.373
Sometimes I wish she was just my mom.

54:10.345 --> 54:11.745
She push you a lot?

54:12.113 --> 54:13.809
Yeah, but it's 'cause she thinks I want it.

54:15.183 --> 54:17.675
You don't? Hold on.

54:18.453 --> 54:19.421
What?

54:19.554 --> 54:21.113
I think my parents are home.

54:21.222 --> 54:25.421
Okay, just get in the house.
I'll... Dang it.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.769
There's that...

54:37.472 --> 54:38.440
Hi.

54:39.207 --> 54:40.800
- Hey, Em.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

54:41.542 --> 54:42.874
What are you guys doing home?

54:43.378 --> 54:45.108
We're making dinner.

54:45.213 --> 54:47.876
We're gonna sit down
and eat together as a family.

54:49.050 --> 54:50.382
Like tonight?

54:52.020 --> 54:53.318
Yes, tonight.

54:54.055 --> 54:56.422
Your father and I talked about what you
said earlier, and you're right.

54:56.524 --> 54:57.548
Yeah.

54:57.659 --> 55:01.221
We should have more time together,
away from phones and work.

55:03.498 --> 55:07.629
That's great, but could we maybe
do this like, tomorrow night?

55:07.735 --> 55:08.930
I thought that...

55:09.037 --> 55:10.300
Oh, it's just...

55:10.571 --> 55:12.005
What, do you have plans?

55:12.206 --> 55:13.333
Well...

55:24.819 --> 55:25.843
Hello.

55:25.953 --> 55:27.922
Hi, Mr. Lowe. I've heard a lot about you.

55:28.256 --> 55:30.418
I'm Jay. I'm a friend of Emily's.

55:31.259 --> 55:34.423
Emily. Your...

55:34.896 --> 55:36.660
Hey, Jay.

55:37.465 --> 55:38.592
Hi, Emily.

55:40.034 --> 55:41.297
Oh, thank you.

55:42.737 --> 55:47.732
As I was saying, me and Jay were
gonna hang out for a bit tonight, so...

55:47.909 --> 55:49.935
Yeah, she was helping me out
with art class.

55:50.111 --> 55:51.204
Richard, who's at the...

55:52.547 --> 55:53.515
Oh, hello.

55:53.748 --> 55:54.875
Hi.

55:55.350 --> 55:56.545
Honey, this is Jay.

55:56.651 --> 55:58.279
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

55:59.120 --> 56:03.182
Anyway, Jay, my parents wanted
to have dinner tonight, so...

56:03.291 --> 56:04.884
We didn't know that you had plans.

56:05.860 --> 56:08.193
- Well...
- Why don't you join us for dinner?

56:08.296 --> 56:10.390
- Mom. No, he doesn't...
- I'd love to.

56:12.834 --> 56:15.201
Have a bite,
and then you guys can take off.

56:15.770 --> 56:17.238
Okay. Sure.

56:20.575 --> 56:23.875
So, are you... You two...

56:24.979 --> 56:29.212
- No. No.
- Dad, no. That's ridiculous.

56:29.484 --> 56:30.474
- Just checking.
- Yeah.

56:30.585 --> 56:31.552
Yeah. Okay.

56:31.652 --> 56:34.451
Richard, why don't
we go get dinner started?

56:41.996 --> 56:42.986
What are you thinking?

56:43.097 --> 56:44.326
What? It's just dinner.

56:44.432 --> 56:45.400
What if they recognize you?

56:45.600 --> 56:46.932
They won't.

56:51.939 --> 56:53.601
You look very familiar.

56:54.909 --> 56:57.538
Maybe you saw him at my school.

56:59.680 --> 57:00.704
Maybe.

57:00.982 --> 57:03.645
I get that a lot. I kind of have that face.

57:03.751 --> 57:05.982
The food is amazing, by the way.

57:06.087 --> 57:07.487
You guys are really good cooks.

57:08.055 --> 57:09.455
Well, thank you, Jay.

57:09.590 --> 57:13.493
We don't get a chance to very often,
but hopefully that's gonna change.

57:15.830 --> 57:17.822
- So you two go to the same school?
- Yeah.

57:17.932 --> 57:21.869
Yep. Same school. We share art
class together. She's really good.

57:22.870 --> 57:24.771
Are you into
the same kind of art as Emily?

57:25.139 --> 57:27.233
Oh, no. I'm nowhere near as good as her.

57:27.442 --> 57:30.002
She's really talented.
She could be the next Banksy.

57:31.379 --> 57:32.472
Who?

57:32.580 --> 57:33.570
Banksy.

57:33.681 --> 57:37.110
He's a street artist who puts art
and stuff up on buildings, public buildings.

57:37.218 --> 57:40.154
Public buildings? Illegally, I'm assuming.

57:41.155 --> 57:44.683
Well, yeah, but most people would
kill to have him paint on their building.

57:45.092 --> 57:46.219
I mean, he's famous.

57:46.394 --> 57:51.199
Does gallery shows, sells tons at auction,
even has a documentary written about him.

57:51.432 --> 57:53.298
It was actually nominated for an Oscar.

57:53.835 --> 57:54.996
Oh, really?

57:55.169 --> 57:56.967
Yeah. He's a celebrity.

57:58.105 --> 58:01.974
And the best thing about his work
is that it always says something.

58:02.076 --> 58:03.305
That's why he does it in public.

58:03.411 --> 58:06.813
'Cause it always has a message.
And I think Emily could be just as great.

58:08.749 --> 58:10.650
Thank you. Jay.

58:12.119 --> 58:13.883
Anyways, I'm more into music.

58:14.188 --> 58:15.212
- Really?
- Yep.

58:15.323 --> 58:16.916
Is that what you want to do,
you want to be a musician?

58:17.024 --> 58:18.822
Maybe.

58:18.926 --> 58:21.486
I thought so at first,
but I'm not so sure right now.

58:23.064 --> 58:24.692
You know, I used to have
a band back in college.

58:25.466 --> 58:26.525
Dad...

58:26.634 --> 58:28.398
What? I did.

58:29.871 --> 58:33.364
And Jay, I got to be honest with you,
it can be a real struggle.

58:34.509 --> 58:36.637
I mean, there's a lot of
competition out there,

58:36.744 --> 58:40.112
so if that's what you want to do,
you better be sure about it.

58:41.549 --> 58:42.744
The same thing we say to Emily.

58:43.918 --> 58:45.682
Come on, Richard. Don't discourage him.

58:45.786 --> 58:46.947
I'm not.

58:47.221 --> 58:49.019
Babe, all I'm saying is
if that's what he wants,

58:49.123 --> 58:51.388
it should be for the right reasons.

58:51.826 --> 58:54.557
It shouldn't be about fortune or fame,
or anything like that.

58:54.662 --> 58:56.756
It should be about the music.

58:57.999 --> 59:00.093
And if only a dozen people
were to hear him play,

59:01.068 --> 59:02.661
it's enough.

59:03.437 --> 59:05.372
'Cause he has something to say.

59:08.676 --> 59:10.736
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

59:11.979 --> 59:13.140
Okay.

59:13.247 --> 59:15.716
Got some of my old CDs
laying around from back in the day,

59:15.816 --> 59:16.909
if you want to go check 'em out.

59:17.018 --> 59:18.008
We really got to get going.

59:18.119 --> 59:19.348
- Let's do it!
- Of course.

59:19.453 --> 59:20.580
Come on.

59:24.292 --> 59:27.057
Just, hey, 10 minutes
and then we can do whatever, okay?

59:30.431 --> 59:31.797
He's adorable.

59:31.933 --> 59:33.731
Mom! Stop.

59:34.502 --> 59:36.801
I already told you, it's...
It's not like that.

59:37.505 --> 59:38.495
Not yet.

59:40.207 --> 59:42.039
Look, I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend.

59:42.677 --> 59:45.237
Pretty sure, or absolutely sure?

59:47.682 --> 59:48.877
I don't know.

59:49.016 --> 59:50.109
Well, maybe you should ask him.

59:50.217 --> 59:52.015
Mom! No.

59:53.154 --> 59:55.316
It doesn't matter.

59:55.423 --> 01:00:00.726
I'm going off to New York.
He's going off to, like, travel.

01:00:00.828 --> 01:00:02.228
It's just not gonna happen.

01:00:02.496 --> 01:00:05.591
Would it be the worst thing in the world
if something did?

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.563
There's no such thing as the right time.

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:10.934
Baby, life doesn't come with guarantees.

01:00:12.406 --> 01:00:15.399
Every now and then,
you just have to take a chance.

01:00:16.043 --> 01:00:17.534
Think about it.

01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:21.347
Okay. We got to go.

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:23.681
Dad! It's getting late.

01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:33.627
I do not understand you.

01:00:33.894 --> 01:00:36.193
What? I'm a parent kind of guy.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.301
Thanks for what you said in there.

01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:41.733
It was true.

01:00:43.304 --> 01:00:45.102
I can't believe you did that.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.770
What? It was fun.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:51.403
Your mom and dad are great.
Now, are you excited to do this or what?

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:53.673
Yeah, you're the one who wanted dinner.

01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:02.147
All right, let's go.

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:13.926
Let's do this.

01:01:24.712 --> 01:01:26.237
Okay. Now I'm officially a criminal.

01:01:26.947 --> 01:01:28.142
What's the worst that could happen?

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.191
This is such a bad idea.

01:01:42.463 --> 01:01:45.695
You keep saying that. Relax.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.702
Okay, where should we start?

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:50.731
This way.

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:53.740
It's so weird being here at night.

01:01:53.974 --> 01:01:56.102
It's weird being here at all.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.076
I don't think I've ever been
inside of a high school.

01:02:00.147 --> 01:02:01.479
Makes me wonder, you know,

01:02:01.582 --> 01:02:04.177
what it would have been like
if I had never gotten famous.

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:06.712
Yeah, life is full of what-ifs.

01:02:06.854 --> 01:02:10.256
Yeah, like, maybe I would have
been in the school choir,

01:02:10.357 --> 01:02:12.758
singing songs, dreaming of stardom.

01:02:14.161 --> 01:02:15.720
Maybe.

01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:21.258
Or maybe you'd be like one of those guys
who says he's "in a band," and he plays

01:02:21.368 --> 01:02:25.635
three chords, two songs,
and plays at parties to get with girls.

01:02:26.907 --> 01:02:28.273
Don't say that to your dad.

01:02:28.776 --> 01:02:31.245
Please. Who do you think told me?

01:02:33.147 --> 01:02:36.117
So, ever wonder if you should
have done things differently?

01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:39.714
Yeah, sometimes.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.984
But I don't know, it's a tradeoff.

01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:47.751
Like, maybe
I'd still be friends with Jessica,

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.893
but then I wouldn't be focused on my art.

01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:55.697
Wouldn't be going to New York.
Wouldn't have met you.

01:02:56.704 --> 01:02:58.673
And I definitely wouldn't be doing this.

01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:03.778
Okay. Here.

01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:09.076
Cool.

01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:11.778
Okay.

01:04:01.602 --> 01:04:03.833
Nice. What's next?

01:05:16.277 --> 01:05:17.540
I don't think I could do it.

01:05:19.113 --> 01:05:22.606
I mean, putting my own art out there is
nerve-wracking enough.

01:05:23.884 --> 01:05:27.753
Performing live? I'd get stage fright.

01:05:27.855 --> 01:05:29.255
You get used to it.

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:33.056
Do you like it?

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.561
Singing in front of tens
of thousands of fans?

01:05:37.798 --> 01:05:39.266
Yes and no.

01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:42.561
Come on, it's got to be pretty cool.

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.232
All those people listening
to what you have to say.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.138
Cheering for you.

01:05:48.242 --> 01:05:49.608
Yeah, but that's just the thing.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:52.509
They're not actually cheering for me.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:58.484
I have this whole team of professionals
that choose what I wear, what I sing...

01:05:58.919 --> 01:05:59.978
Everything.

01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:03.783
I'm just playing a part.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.690
So? I mean, not all singers
write their own songs.

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:11.496
That's true.

01:06:11.598 --> 01:06:13.965
But at least they get to
pick their own songs.

01:06:14.068 --> 01:06:17.061
When I first started out,
I didn't just want to be a singer.

01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:20.039
I wanted to express myself through music.

01:06:22.076 --> 01:06:24.102
Well, then, why don't you change it?

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:25.338
It's not that easy.

01:06:26.246 --> 01:06:27.612
Sure it is.

01:06:28.482 --> 01:06:30.178
I mean, you already have a huge audience.

01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:33.220
Just make the kind of music
you want to make.

01:06:34.521 --> 01:06:36.513
Maybe I don't have anything to say.

01:06:39.393 --> 01:06:40.417
I don't believe that.

01:06:42.429 --> 01:06:44.159
Maybe no one will like it.

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:52.000
Well, I think as long as you like it,
that's all that really matters.

01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:54.669
I guess.

01:06:57.978 --> 01:07:01.380
You know, there are
so many people out there just

01:07:02.249 --> 01:07:04.150
desperately trying to get noticed.

01:07:06.787 --> 01:07:10.355
Instead of feeling trapped, you should
try and see this as an opportunity.

01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:17.422
Life doesn't come with guarantees.

01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:21.429
Sometimes you just have to take a chance.

01:07:28.876 --> 01:07:30.640
Come on. We're not done yet.

01:07:45.926 --> 01:07:48.987
Number 22, Jordan Jaye
with the game-winning shot.

01:07:49.997 --> 01:07:51.556
You are such a dork.

01:07:53.133 --> 01:07:55.125
All right. Where are we doing this?

01:07:55.602 --> 01:07:58.436
Right here.
We're gonna need more light, though.

01:07:59.606 --> 01:08:00.801
I got it.

01:08:05.712 --> 01:08:06.873
Hey, what's this?

01:08:11.285 --> 01:08:15.985
Okay, this is awesome.
Why is this happening?

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:18.884
It's left over from homecoming.

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:24.822
Come on, let's try it out.

01:08:26.567 --> 01:08:27.591
No.

01:08:27.701 --> 01:08:29.169
Oh, come on. Why not?

01:08:30.136 --> 01:08:31.104
I don't dance.

01:08:31.471 --> 01:08:33.167
Yes, you do. Everyone dances.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.939
No, you don't understand.
I literally cannot dance.

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:38.478
Come on. Anybody can dance.

01:08:38.578 --> 01:08:39.706
You just got to try.

01:08:39.813 --> 01:08:43.908
Just got to get in the groove. Get into it.
Got to get into the rhythm, you know?

01:08:44.017 --> 01:08:48.182
Little groove? There you go.
See, baby steps. It's all in the hustle.

01:08:48.287 --> 01:08:49.278
So bad.

01:08:49.389 --> 01:08:53.785
There you go. See? There you go,
you got it. I knew you had it in you.

01:09:07.841 --> 01:09:09.502
Come on. Coward.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.145
Oh, my God. Fine.

01:09:21.255 --> 01:09:23.247
I guess this isn't so bad.

01:09:23.357 --> 01:09:25.826
Not much of a school dance
type girl, are you?

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:30.529
Bunch of drunk teenagers
acting stupid and hooking up?

01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:32.861
No, thanks.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.533
I think it sounds kind of fun.

01:09:35.102 --> 01:09:36.399
Okay, then you can go.

01:09:36.937 --> 01:09:38.131
Maybe I will.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:40.532
Sure.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.769
Seriously. When's your next dance?

01:09:43.644 --> 01:09:45.044
I don't know, prom.

01:09:45.212 --> 01:09:48.740
Perfect. I'll come by after tour,

01:09:48.849 --> 01:09:52.616
swing by and could be your date.
Sounds fun, right?

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.779
Jordan...

01:09:55.055 --> 01:09:56.045
What?

01:09:57.658 --> 01:09:58.956
Stop.

01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:00.620
Stop what?

01:10:02.396 --> 01:10:03.728
Let's not do this.

01:10:05.132 --> 01:10:07.431
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:10.397
Let's not pretend like
we're gonna see each other after this.

01:10:11.071 --> 01:10:12.334
Why not?

01:10:13.273 --> 01:10:15.242
'Cause it's just not gonna happen.

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:20.247
So you're telling me after all this,
it's just over?

01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:22.713
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:25.013
Why are you being like this?

01:10:25.686 --> 01:10:29.123
Being like what? Realistic?

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:32.621
God, we just met like
two days ago, Jordan.

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:38.765
I'm going off to school,
you have a life to get back to.

01:10:38.865 --> 01:10:40.595
It's just not gonna happen.

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:42.560
Maybe I'm not going back.

01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:45.466
Of course you are.

01:10:46.106 --> 01:10:49.076
You're not stupid enough
to throw it all away.

01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:51.909
Look, you're just bored
and you're unhappy,

01:10:52.012 --> 01:10:55.346
and you're using me as an excuse
to not deal with it.

01:10:56.216 --> 01:10:59.550
But I'm just some girl
who gave you a ride.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.984
And in a week from now,
it'll be like this never happened, okay?

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:06.060
And that's... That's fine with me.

01:11:07.694 --> 01:11:09.959
So you didn't feel anything?

01:11:10.631 --> 01:11:11.724
That's not the point.

01:11:12.032 --> 01:11:14.092
Yeah, it kind of is.

01:11:19.039 --> 01:11:20.132
Don't you have a girlfriend?

01:11:20.307 --> 01:11:21.605
What? No.

01:11:22.643 --> 01:11:25.078
Oh, really? Then what about Nikki Brown?

01:11:25.312 --> 01:11:26.712
Did you google me?

01:11:26.913 --> 01:11:28.108
Do not change the subject.

01:11:28.248 --> 01:11:31.741
No, okay. We dated for like five minutes,
but it's over. All right?

01:11:31.952 --> 01:11:35.979
Our managers set us up, and she still acts
like we're dating for publicity reasons.

01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:37.316
And that was okay with you?

01:11:37.691 --> 01:11:38.852
I didn't think it mattered.

01:11:41.762 --> 01:11:43.958
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:11:45.232 --> 01:11:49.067
Celebrity ex-girlfriends,
and managers, and publicity.

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:53.607
You're a part of this whole other world,
and I am just me.

01:11:55.242 --> 01:11:57.541
And that's totally fine, seriously.

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:05.609
Can we please just do this
and get out of here?

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:09.387
Yeah.

01:13:22.929 --> 01:13:24.295
Look.

01:13:25.799 --> 01:13:29.031
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I got like that.

01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:32.038
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

01:13:32.672 --> 01:13:36.666
You were just being nice.
I'm the one who got all serious.

01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:39.910
No, but you're right. We did just meet.

01:13:40.013 --> 01:13:42.847
I don't know, I just...
I was having such a fun time.

01:13:42.949 --> 01:13:43.939
Got carried away.

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:45.279
Me, too.

01:13:45.385 --> 01:13:47.547
I mean, I've had a...

01:13:47.654 --> 01:13:50.180
I've had a really great time.

01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:53.158
And what you've done for me,
I'm really grateful.

01:13:53.293 --> 01:13:54.420
Don't be.

01:13:54.528 --> 01:13:58.522
I got just as much out of all this
as you did. Maybe more.

01:13:59.499 --> 01:14:02.492
Okay. So we're good?

01:14:03.136 --> 01:14:04.263
We're great.

01:14:05.138 --> 01:14:08.074
Great. Hey, what time is it?

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:12.338
Looks like after 6:00.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.145
Come on. Something I want to show you.

01:17:22.869 --> 01:17:24.428
Car should be here soon.

01:17:29.676 --> 01:17:31.668
So, what's after Vegas?

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.377
Chicago, I think.

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:38.782
I don't actually know.

01:17:40.587 --> 01:17:42.078
What about after the tour's over?

01:17:43.456 --> 01:17:44.856
Not sure.

01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:51.725
So I was thinking about
what we talked about earlier.

01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:54.192
Yeah?

01:17:55.769 --> 01:17:57.761
I think I'm gonna try
a different approach.

01:17:57.871 --> 01:17:59.430
See what happens.

01:18:00.974 --> 01:18:02.602
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:18:03.009 --> 01:18:06.241
For the first time in a long time,
I feel pretty great.

01:18:07.347 --> 01:18:08.781
Kind of like anything's possible.

01:18:13.887 --> 01:18:15.719
So what about you?

01:18:15.822 --> 01:18:17.586
What do you think's
gonna happen on Monday?

01:18:19.859 --> 01:18:24.194
I have no idea. I don't really care.

01:18:26.499 --> 01:18:28.798
I just know things are gonna be different.

01:18:29.969 --> 01:18:32.302
I think that's all that matters.

01:18:42.449 --> 01:18:45.681
Listen, this has been
one of the best times

01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:48.277
I've had in a long, long time.

01:18:48.388 --> 01:18:50.152
I'm not gonna forget it in a week.

01:18:51.124 --> 01:18:52.422
Yeah, me either.

01:18:55.361 --> 01:18:56.488
Give me your phone.

01:18:59.999 --> 01:19:05.563
Okay, this is my number. All right?
Like, no one has this number.

01:19:07.707 --> 01:19:09.573
I want to hear everything
that happens, okay?

01:19:09.943 --> 01:19:11.070
Okay.

01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:16.679
You're gonna do great. I know it.

01:19:17.784 --> 01:19:19.013
So are you.

01:19:22.288 --> 01:19:23.449
Bye, Emily.

01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:25.419
Bye.

01:19:27.827 --> 01:19:29.159
Jordan.

01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:08.899
Art for me has always been about change.

01:20:09.736 --> 01:20:13.195
Changing the way you see a building,

01:20:13.406 --> 01:20:16.274
a town, yourself.

01:20:17.677 --> 01:20:20.647
But I've finally realized
people can do that, too.

01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:26.884
It's easy to think
that nobody understands,

01:20:29.088 --> 01:20:30.954
that other people have it easier.

01:20:36.162 --> 01:20:37.824
But everyone is struggling
in different ways,

01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:41.026
and in the end,
we all want the same things.

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.440
To figure out who we are
and where we fit in.

01:20:50.243 --> 01:20:52.769
It's a question with no simple answer.

01:20:52.879 --> 01:20:55.041
You just have to try your best,

01:20:57.183 --> 01:21:00.620
make an effort, make mistakes.

01:21:02.789 --> 01:21:05.623
Time will pass,
and things will get better, step by step.

01:21:07.126 --> 01:21:08.788
There's a whole big world out there.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:18.298
Whole world beyond me,
beyond you, beyond everyone.

01:21:22.675 --> 01:21:25.543
There are millions of people,
each with their own story to tell.

01:21:26.946 --> 01:21:30.576
But if you're lucky,
you'll get to be a part of it,

01:21:30.683 --> 01:21:33.312
and they'll get to be a part of yours.

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.322
Hey. How's Tokyo?

01:22:16.129 --> 01:22:17.358
What time is it there?

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:20.226
Early. So, you all packed?

01:22:21.834 --> 01:22:23.097
Yeah. I think I am.

01:22:24.237 --> 01:22:25.296
So?

01:22:26.539 --> 01:22:27.529
So what?

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.506
Come on. You know what.

01:22:29.976 --> 01:22:31.877
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:22:33.212 --> 01:22:34.703
Are you going or not?

01:22:36.683 --> 01:22:38.743
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

01:22:39.319 --> 01:22:41.720
Come on. Yes, you have.

01:22:42.655 --> 01:22:44.624
Emily, can you come out here?

01:22:45.325 --> 01:22:47.851
Yeah. I'll be out in a few.

01:22:47.961 --> 01:22:52.592
Okay, I got to go. I promise I'll take
a bunch of pictures. Get some sleep.

01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.259
Later.

01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:11.543
Oh, you look beautiful.

01:23:11.684 --> 01:23:12.777
Thank you.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.915
Look outside.

01:23:36.209 --> 01:23:37.837
I thought you were in Tokyo.

01:23:38.011 --> 01:23:40.712
We leave Monday.
Took the weekend off.

01:23:40.813 --> 01:23:44.312
- You never fail to surprise me.
- I told you I wanted to go to prom.

01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:46.977
You showed me that
you have to have an actual life.

01:23:47.887 --> 01:23:51.186
I know. You showed me that, too.

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:53.783
You look amazing in that dress,
by the way.

01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:57.162
Thanks. That's a nice tux.

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:01.225
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:04.770
