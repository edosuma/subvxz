WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.673
REED (over speakerphone):
One more item, Admiral.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.408
You got 30 seconds.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.043
Got breakfast
with the undersecretary.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.744
It's about the Hornets
on the Phoenix, sir.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.080
Offloading ordnance?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.748
14 tons on deck waiting to go.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.717
Problem is the weather.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.119
I'm looking at it.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.388
Try it tonight
if the ceiling lifts.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.623
But I don't want any Gatlings
in the Atlantic.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.724
Makes two of us.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.693
Thank you, sir.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.163
Fleet movements
in the Suez, sir.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.065
And remember
to print out your speech.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.700
Oh, right.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.803
COMPUTER VOICE (Russian accent):
The Elliott Virus

00:35.836 --> 00:38.739
has encrypted your device
with an unbreakable algorithm.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.676
Purchase a decryption key
or lose your data forever.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.711
The hell is this?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.479
Downey.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.251
What did you do?

00:50.284 --> 00:52.720
Nothing. I opened an e-mail.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.756
The Elliott Virus
has encrypted your device

00:55.789 --> 00:59.693
with an unbreakable algorithm.
Sir, you've been hacked.

00:59.727 --> 01:03.097
Purchase a decryption key
or lose your data forever.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.133
*

01:35.463 --> 01:37.465
(gun clicks)

01:55.916 --> 01:59.153
FIRING LINE COMMANDER:
Cease fire. Cease fire.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.689
Make sure
the firing lane is safe

02:01.722 --> 02:03.891
before going downrange
to score your targets.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.526
McGEE:
Boss, where's your SIG?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.795
Old Corps, McGee.
Going back to my roots.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.497
McGEE:
That your old .45?

02:09.530 --> 02:12.300
GIBBS:
That's my dad's Colt. 1911.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.534
I grew up shooting it.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.868
Reliable. Packs a punch.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.869
I don't know.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.806
It just feels right.
Yeah.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.175
I can see why.
Special Agent McGee.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.177
Yes?
Lieutenant Downey.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.346
Aide to Vice Admiral Chase.
He okay?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.548
He needs to see
Agent McGee right away.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.949
Sure.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.519
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.653
Where's Quinn?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.888
This was a
mandatory re-qual.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.824
Worry about
yourself, Torres.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.260
And your aim.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.330
Oh, no.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.232
No, no, no, no, no.
Not there. Not there.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.667
Uh, the impatiens go over there.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.769
They only, they only
thrive in the shade.

02:48.802 --> 02:49.970
Like some people I know.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.339
QUINN:
Marie.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.740
There you are.
Hey!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.408
Baby!
Wh...

02:54.442 --> 02:55.776
What are you
doing here?

02:55.809 --> 02:56.777
What am I doing here?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.612
Okay, let's go
with your question.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.482
You text me, "911. Emergency."

03:01.515 --> 03:03.951
Oh, forget about that.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.819
I'm obviously okay now.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.889
It's not obvious to me
the last hour.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.658
I... Where's your phone?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.460
Um, it's here. Here.

03:12.493 --> 03:15.696
You know, I have a very bad
relationship with this phone.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.598
Yep, I have
the ringer off.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.999
I'm sorry, baby.

03:19.032 --> 03:19.833
Oh.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.536
Look at this place.
Look at it.
Hmm.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.238
MARIE:
Look at all the color.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.907
Oh, God, I love spring.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.977
Jorge, uh, the pansies go
in the window box.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.979
The window box.
Marie...

03:32.012 --> 03:34.482
Oh, never mind, I'll
deal with that later.
Marie, listen, next time,

03:34.515 --> 03:37.718
no more 911s unless you really
mean it from now on, okay?

03:37.751 --> 03:38.852
Okay.
Okay?

03:38.886 --> 03:41.021
Okay.
Okay.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.989
See you tomorrow night.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.692
What's tomorrow night?

03:44.725 --> 03:47.328
Darling, it's your
father's birthday.

03:47.361 --> 03:51.365
Oh, come on, you
didn't forget.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.968
I'm making my celebrated
12-hour ribs, baby.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.904
No, I did...
I didn't forget.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.906
Uh, I'll be here.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.577
Ransom what?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.878
McGEE:
Ransomware.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.048
Like malware.
The computer virus.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.917
How did I get it?
Well, my guess is

04:09.950 --> 04:12.786
you clicked a link that had
the ransomware embedded in it.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.054
Oh, my sister's e-mail.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.823
Is there any
classified data on here?

04:15.856 --> 04:19.293
Classified, unclassified.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.495
And when was the last time
you backed this up?
Never.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.397
I have antivirus software.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.432
Viruses mutate.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.600
Well...

04:26.634 --> 04:27.935
That's why the flu virus
circumvents

04:27.968 --> 04:29.770
the flu vaccine every year.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.071
CHASE:
What does this mean?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.039
Well, you click that,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.642
and it sends the virus
to people you know.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.577
They pay, you get
the decryption key.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.778
(scoffs)

04:37.811 --> 04:39.747
Admiral, you're not
the first one

04:39.780 --> 04:42.950
to be infected by ransomware,
and you won't be the last.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.952
Hundreds of companies,
thousands of people

04:44.985 --> 04:46.053
have all paid the ransom.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.756
Well, I won't. No way in hell.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.425
You know, Admiral,

04:51.459 --> 04:54.528
it's pretty reasonable,
actually-- it's $500.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.100
Tim, your father used to brag
about you all the time.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.371
Said you were NCIS's
number one cyber tech.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.038
I know you can
figure this out.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.575
Admiral, this isn't some kind
of riddle that I can solve.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.377
Okay, the data
is locked up

05:09.410 --> 05:10.978
until you input
the decryption key.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.714
So input it.
That's what I'm trying
to tell you is that

05:13.747 --> 05:15.015
you need to pay to get the key.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.950
If you don't pay,
you lose everything on here--

05:16.984 --> 05:18.852
photos, documents, everything.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.522
41 years in the Navy,

05:21.555 --> 05:23.457
I have never surrendered
to the enemy.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.460
I'm not about
to start now.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.366
Impressive range score, Ellie.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.101
Only three points
behind Gibbs.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.737
Really? Hmm.
I didn't notice.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.573
Yeah, Ellie's a deadeye.
Glad she's on our side.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.810
Ah, there she is.
QUINN: Morning.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.946
Hey, Quinn, you missed
a serious gunplay this morning.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.047
Oh.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.117
Really, though, where were you?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.119
Uh, at the corner
of mind your own business.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.120
Oh.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.723
Okay.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.857
You won't believe
what that was about.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.126
The admiral asked you to
track down the computer hacker

05:59.159 --> 06:01.395
who infected his laptop
with ransomware?

06:01.429 --> 06:02.530
Yeah, he called Vance
after you left.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.864
Gibbs is up there right now.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.133
This guy won't let up.
Where's his laptop?

06:06.166 --> 06:08.101
I didn't take it. I told him
there's nothing I could do.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.170
You did the right thing, McGee.
Thank you, boss.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.139
Quinn.
Mm-hmm.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.041
Are you good?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.544
You need more time?
No, thank you.

06:21.014 --> 06:21.949
Oh, the admiral.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.852
Looks like he finally
came to his senses.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.421
COMPUTER VOICE (over phone):
The Elliott Virus

06:27.455 --> 06:30.190
has encrypted your device
with an unbreakable...

06:30.223 --> 06:31.759
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.793
Wait, what just happened?
Is that...

06:32.826 --> 06:34.562
Wait. Everyone, listen up.
Get off your Wi-Fis.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.664
We're all connected
on the same network.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.766
If I got infected...
(computer voice speaking
over all computers)

06:38.799 --> 06:41.869
Purchase a decryption key
or lose your data forever.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.573
Purchase a decryption key or
lose your data forever.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.607
We all got hacked.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.085
VANCE: You intentionally
infected an NCIS agent

06:58.118 --> 06:59.953
with a computer virus?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.955
I was trying
to motivate him.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.092
By committing a felony?
Five felonies?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.628
I meant to send it
to Tim only.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.996
Viruses spread.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.531
Are you going after me

07:10.564 --> 07:12.833
or the hacker that started this?
We could do both.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.701
McGEE:
Look, I was able

07:13.734 --> 07:15.803
to contain the virus
to only our team.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.772
Nothing classified is at risk;
all data's backed up.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.608
That said, I don't
suspect our admiral

07:20.641 --> 07:22.042
would have done
something so foolish

07:22.075 --> 07:23.210
without a very
good reason.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.882
It's photographs.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.985
Of my wife, God rest her soul.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.887
Memories I can't get back.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.156
I meant to
print them out.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.226
That's why we have
to get this guy.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.629
Sir, we have our entire cyber
crime unit working on this,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.731
but as far as getting
our hacker by tomorrow,

07:43.764 --> 07:45.065
it's just impossible.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.501
Nothing is impossible, Tim.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.839
Hypothetically,
how would someone defeat

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
this ransomware virus?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.043
Humor me.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.778
Well, there's only one way,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.913
and that would be to find
the physical location

07:59.947 --> 08:03.216
of the computer server hosting
it, shut it down from there.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
And this server could
operate from anywhere?
Anywhere in the world.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.787
That's why most people pay
the $500.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.822
It's not worth the time
and energy to fight.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.090
Well, paying the ransom may be

08:10.123 --> 08:11.525
the answer for civilians,
Agent McGee,

08:11.559 --> 08:12.626
but the government's
not in the business

08:12.660 --> 08:13.794
of financing terrorists.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.596
And make no mistake,
that's exactly

08:15.629 --> 08:17.097
what these hackers are.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.732
Gibbs, is your team
working on a case?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.768
We are now.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.273
QUINN: It's so weird
without cell phones.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.908
Yeah, and not laptop.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.242
Well, the desktops still work.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.911
They're hardwired
to a different network.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.782
Burn phones, till we get
our new smartphones tomorrow.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.216
Seriously?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.285
This takes me back
to my undercover days.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.687
BISHOP:
I mean, (scoffs)

08:39.720 --> 08:41.555
what do you even do
with these things?

08:41.589 --> 08:42.923
Call people.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.792
Boss?
No, I'm good.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.327
Hack-proof.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.796
Flip phone.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.999
What do we know
about ransomware?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.835
BISHOP: Well, this is a screen-
grab of the Elliott virus.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.004
It's not on anyone's radar,
so it's new.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.205
QUINN: I'm trying to
trace the I.P. address,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.007
but the hacker has hopped

09:00.040 --> 09:02.309
through multiple proxies,
all located in Russia.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.011
Also, Gibbs, MI6 has

09:04.044 --> 09:04.945
a guy in Moscow

09:04.978 --> 09:06.880
who specializes in
counter-cyberterrorism.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.216
Say the word,
and I can get him in MTAC.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.952
IAN:
75% of all ransomware

09:11.985 --> 09:13.353
originates in Russia.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.024
It's a source of national pride.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.592
Special Agent Gibbs and McGee,

09:18.626 --> 09:21.862
MI6 Intel Officer
Ian Lipovetskiy.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.965
I call it, um, the Russian
invasion. (chuckles)

09:24.998 --> 09:27.367
They penetrate your borders
without ever leaving

09:27.400 --> 09:29.036
the comfort of
their gulag.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.238
Do you recognize
the virus, Officer?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.106
No. Never seen it before.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.942
But I think that your hacker is

09:34.975 --> 09:37.310
from your side of the pond.
An American? Why?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.279
The warning voice is
computer-generated,

09:39.312 --> 09:42.616
so why does it have
a Russian accent?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.384
That's pretty thin evidence.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.119
Well, I have more.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.923
The, uh, the ransom page itself,
it doesn't have any typos.

09:49.957 --> 09:53.661
The Russian hackers' demands
tend to be

09:53.694 --> 09:57.297
full of misspellings
or improper syntax,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.399
but this is
grammatically perfect.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.901
What do you suggest?

10:00.934 --> 10:03.403
Well, my counterpart,
Clint Asher,

10:03.436 --> 10:07.074
who works for your government,
operates out of Langley.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.343
If he can't help you,
no one can.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.182
And this is where
it all happens.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.085
Well, it's certainly
very orange.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.653
TORRES (chuckles):
Yeah.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.788
And there she is.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.091
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.659
Not exactly thrilled
to see me.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.661
No, not not thrilled.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.697
Oh, darling, I know this
is going over the line,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
I know this is
totally verboten,

10:31.832 --> 10:35.669
but I remembered
what the 911 was about,

10:35.703 --> 10:37.304
and I tried to
call your cell phone,

10:37.337 --> 10:38.872
and it's not working.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.141
So...
So, I was at security,

10:41.174 --> 10:42.843
I overheard
whose mother she was,

10:42.876 --> 10:45.312
and I'm not gonna let you
wait down there.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.446
Mm.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.415
And I've always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.884
You're such a Blanche.
Oh!

10:50.918 --> 10:53.220
Oh, no, she's not a Blanche,
she's a Marie.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.355
Honey, anyone
this adorable

10:55.388 --> 10:57.958
who knows Streetcar
can call me whatever he wants.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.427
Uh, okay, Mom.
Uh, what did you want?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.929
My Crock-Pot, kid.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.463
You took it
four weeks ago,

11:03.496 --> 11:04.765
and I haven't seen it since.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.300
Is that what the 911 was about?
Yeah.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.902
Well, how am I gonna make
12-hour ribs

11:08.936 --> 11:10.370
without my Crock-Pot?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.372
12-hour ribs? Wow.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.274
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.744
Oh, no.
He's-he's very busy.
I am?

11:16.777 --> 11:20.213
Mm-hmm. You signed up
for the stakeout... mission.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.249
Oh, damn. Yeah. The...

11:22.282 --> 11:23.984
There's this, uh, mission
that's a stakeout.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.386
It's like a stakeout mission,
I signed up for.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.922
Oh. Well, some
other time, then.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.490
Another time, then.
Yep, rain check it.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.725
Rain check!
Yeah.

11:31.759 --> 11:32.826
But you know what?
Let's-let's go get

11:32.860 --> 11:34.161
the Crock-Pot now.
Really?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.428
Yeah.
We can go right now?

11:35.462 --> 11:36.363
Absolutely.
You can take that time?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.397
You're gonna cover for me?

11:37.430 --> 11:39.299
Absolutely.
Great.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.401
Well, Nick, it was a
pleasure to meet you.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.436
It was all mine.
Or should I call you Stanley?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.472
Go ahead and
call me Stanley.
(laughs)

11:45.505 --> 11:47.340
Come on. Come on.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.409
Oh, baby, I don't know
how you get any work done

11:49.442 --> 11:52.012
with a charmer like that around.
Mm-hmm.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.047
Moms love me.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.751
Ransomware is exploding.

11:57.785 --> 12:01.354
It's gone from one percent of my
day to 80% in just three years.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.756
Hmm. Why?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
Money.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.226
Last year, Americans paid
a quarter billion dollars

12:06.259 --> 12:07.427
to unlock their data.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.763
Did you say a billion?

12:09.797 --> 12:13.901
(chuckles) With a
capital "B," yes.

12:13.934 --> 12:18.839
So... why is NCIS going
after cyberterrorists?

12:18.872 --> 12:21.308
Not that I can't
use the help, but...

12:22.542 --> 12:24.211
Oh.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.115
You're not here as agents,
you're here as victims.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.382
Well, technically, we're both.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.784
No shame in that.

12:30.818 --> 12:35.422
So, Ian thinks that
your hacker is American.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
What are we looking at?

12:37.825 --> 12:40.127
Well, it's called
the Elliott Virus.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.261
Elliott?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.229
Yeah.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.530
You heard of it?

12:43.563 --> 12:46.399
No, just, uh,
let me take a look.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.401
(sighs)

12:54.107 --> 12:55.876
Huh.
What?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.878
Uh, nothing.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.147
Just, every time
I see a ransom screen,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.082
it reminds me of chasing ghosts.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.957
I have a program that analyzes
code snippets in the binaries

13:09.990 --> 13:12.159
to try to match it
with a known virus.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.861
I'll get right on it and
get back to you tonight.

13:13.894 --> 13:14.862
We'd appreciate that.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.596
Here's a temporary number.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.531
Obviously,

13:18.565 --> 13:21.134
sooner than later
would be better.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.036
(tears paper)

13:24.037 --> 13:25.805
Of course.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.110
Thanks.
Yeah.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.048
What do you think?

13:35.082 --> 13:36.884
Guy scratches his neck a lot.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.319
Yeah, you think Asher knows more
than he's saying, don't you?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.054
Well, that neck
thing is his tell.

13:41.088 --> 13:44.257
I could take all that guy's
money at a poker table.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.159
So what's he hiding?

13:46.193 --> 13:49.362
I can't see his cards, I
can just see he's bluffing.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.864
Well, let's bring him in.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.499
See what shakes out
in interrogation.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.567
Yeah.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.637
How'd you know I
thought he was dodgy?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.340
'Cause you have
a tell, too.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.342
Really? What is it?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.576
(scoffs)

14:03.610 --> 14:04.577
Asher?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.850
Asher?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.621
He's gone.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.589
I thought he was gonna

14:16.623 --> 14:17.624
get right on it
and get back to us tonight.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.110
It's like I'm
living in 1997.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.913
I know, right? It took me, like,
ten minutes to text "Hello."

14:39.947 --> 14:42.449
(sighs) How does
Gibbs live like this?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.317
Very well, thank you.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.353
Oh. Hey, Gibbs.
Help me out here.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.423
I can only preprogram
nine numbers into this phone.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.691
Yeah. So?

14:51.724 --> 14:54.461
Well, so how do you call
everyone else?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.363
I remember their phone numbers.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.364
That's insane.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.466
(laughs) Clint Asher.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.667
Where is he?
Vanished.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.469
Uh, we were the last people
to see him.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.570
That was 15 hours ago.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.038
Yeah, his wife said
he didn't come home last night,

15:05.072 --> 15:06.406
so I'm bringing her in
to talk to us.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.440
REEVES:
Asher hasn't used a credit card,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.409
accessed an ATM machine,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.344
or made a phone call since
he walked out on us last night.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.712
And his phone's shut off.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.348
He even turned off
the GPS in his car.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.384
Where's McGee?
Down with Abby,
checking the traffic cams

15:17.417 --> 15:18.651
around his office.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.354
What do we know about him?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.723
REEVES: 30 years old.
Married, one son.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.358
Works for the government's
counter-cyberterrorism

15:25.392 --> 15:26.526
task force.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.261
No arrests.
No major debts.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.530
No major assets.
Red flags?

15:30.563 --> 15:33.000
One. Uh, he was kicked out
of college his senior year.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.369
For what?
For quote, "Conduct detrimental
to the university."

15:36.403 --> 15:38.338
What kind of conduct?
Finding that out now.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.073
Yeah, Abby?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.474
Yeah, yeah. I'm on the way down.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.176
That's good.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.278
I love this phone.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.348
Hey, how's Mom?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.350
Oh, uh, Mom's Mom.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.584
Sorry about yesterday.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.386
Sorry for what?
She was cool.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.356
Yeah, she's cool.
And nuts.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.757
Oh, everyone thinks
their mom is nuts.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.393
Mm. Not like Marie.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.331
Why do you
call her that?

16:04.364 --> 16:07.034
Oh, well, why not?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.469
I'm kind of like the mother
in the relationship.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.304
No, seriously,
though. Why?

16:11.338 --> 16:12.672
Seriously?

16:12.705 --> 16:15.175
Well, she told me to.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.677
She thought "Mom"
made her sound too old,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.779
especially when my friends
and I were teenagers.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.781
Ah, an original cougar.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.551
I like to think of it
as a youthful quality.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.753
You know. Not so much anymore.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.188
(clicks tongue)

16:30.523 --> 16:32.192
There something else?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.327
Like what?

16:34.361 --> 16:35.662
Like something else
you're not saying?

16:38.798 --> 16:41.234
Like, a family secret?

16:41.268 --> 16:43.470
Who are you, Oprah, now?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.437
Okay.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
Forget I asked.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.241
Okay.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.479
Where is he?

16:54.481 --> 16:58.618
Well, we were hoping that you
could tell us, Mrs. Asher.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.054
(scoffs)
I don't know anything.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.157
You're supposed
to tell me something.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.459
Has he ever
disappeared before?

17:06.493 --> 17:10.630
No. Not until you walked
into his office.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.465
What did you say to him?

17:12.499 --> 17:16.436
Well, he was helping with our
investigation into ransomware.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.739
That's what he does every day.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.642
He puts hackers behind bars.

17:22.675 --> 17:27.814
Maybe... one of them got out
and came after him.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.552
We'd like permission
to look at his home computer.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.487
Depends.

17:34.521 --> 17:39.459
Does NCIS consider him
a victim or a suspect?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.128
Mrs. Asher...

17:41.161 --> 17:44.497
You know what? Um, go ahead.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.569
My husband is a good man.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.271
We found Clint Asher.
Where?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.606
Well, we-we
found his car.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.507
Traffic cams?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.609
Nope. Satellite radio.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.611
All right. I think
we have everything. Thank you.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.413
I don't follow.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.682
Well, Asher's Toyota
has satellite radio.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.817
Pays a recurring
monthly fee for it.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.820
We got the serial number to the
radio control unit in his car,

18:07.854 --> 18:10.523
and the satellite company was
able to locate the transmitter.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.592
Satellite radios
have transmitters?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.827
Some do, to record
proprietary information, yeah.

18:14.861 --> 18:18.898
Okay, got it. Off Highway 224,
south of Marbury, Maryland.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.602
The car has been there
since 7:27 this morning.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.372
Go, McGee. Take Bishop.
All right, Abby,
send me the coordinates.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.708
Um, McGee, your phone
doesn't do GPS.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.678
Oh, right. So...

18:31.711 --> 18:33.546
A map, McGee.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.547
Remember maps?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.149
Maps, right.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.717
Where was Asher's
car before this?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.220
Annandale, Virginia.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.421
Stayed there overnight.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.655
That a hotel?

18:42.689 --> 18:43.923
Industrial area.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.727
Uh, looks like some kind
of self-storage facility.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.397
The car arrived there
just after

18:50.430 --> 18:51.631
9:00 last night,

18:51.664 --> 18:56.203
and didn't move again
until 6:46 this morning.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.737
BISHOP:
How many miles?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.206
McGEE:
3.6.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.674
BISHOP:
Oh. Oh, stop. We're here.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.686
What do you mean, we're here?
There's nothing here.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.623
You sure you're reading
that map right?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.757
Maybe you missed it.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.692
Maybe you missed it.
I was reading the map.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.329
You know, we sound like
an old married couple right now.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.664
(sighs) Sorry. I just
really miss my phone.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.266
You mind if I look at that?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.634
Okay.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
Well, you're right,
this is exactly where

19:29.536 --> 19:30.737
Asher's car should be.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.772
Yep.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
McGee.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.754
Is that Asher's car?

19:50.290 --> 19:51.624
BUZZ:
Nope.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.360
And nope.

19:53.393 --> 19:57.664
No unit has been rented
to a Clint Asher.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.733
Or an Asher Clint,
for that matter.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.836
So I'm-I'm sorry, I
can't help you guys.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.538
GIBBS:
Noticed you have

20:05.572 --> 20:07.807
security cameras
at your front gate.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.810
Oh, God.

20:14.681 --> 20:18.251
Last night, 9:02 p.m.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.920
What kind of car is it
you guys are looking for?

20:20.953 --> 20:22.622
Toyota Camry. Blue.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.757
Well, that's pretty common.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.594
Uh, are you sure I should even

20:27.627 --> 20:28.728
be showing you this?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
There.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.699
TORRES: Yeah. License plate
matches. That's him.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.033
Who's in the passenger seat?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.702
TORRES:
I can't make him out.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.337
BUZZ:
We good?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.439
No.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.809
We stay here
and watch that car leave.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.678
6:46 this morning.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.347
(sighs)

20:47.380 --> 20:49.549
TORRES: Here it is.
Blue Camry.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.718
But it's just the driver.
Where's the other guy?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.653
Which storage unit
did they access?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.955
The cameras are
only on the gates.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.023
Buzz, that is not
what he's asking.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.591
Oh, I get it.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.427
See, you get to ask
all the questions,

21:00.460 --> 21:02.662
Buzz gets to do all the work.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.797
(sighs)
The gate code corresponds

21:04.831 --> 21:06.866
to the storage unit.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.035
So that's 217.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.437
Who rents that unit?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.372
Uh... (scoffs)

21:12.405 --> 21:15.475
You know what? I got it.
You've done enough.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.346
Boom.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.749
All right, Unit 217
rented to David Yates.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.951
I'm gonna take
a picture of this.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.989
I'm taking this.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.891
Fine. Did you boys
get what you need?

21:31.924 --> 21:32.959
No, not yet.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.935
(laughing)

21:49.041 --> 21:51.678
Hello. Hello!

21:54.013 --> 21:56.449
Hello, Bishop.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.717
We didn't find anything.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.886
BISHOP:
We did.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.802
Asher's Camry.
Looks like someone dumped it.

22:34.421 --> 22:35.855
Hey, guys, what is that?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.591
That steam?

22:38.625 --> 22:39.726
That open the trunk?

22:39.759 --> 22:40.960
No.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.562
Here.

22:44.431 --> 22:46.399
Thanks.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.135
All right.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.838
Ready?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.808
Whoa.

22:55.842 --> 22:56.909
Why's he look like that?

22:59.979 --> 23:00.980
He's frozen solid.

23:16.162 --> 23:21.768
I apologize in advance,
Mr. Asher, but this might hurt.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.603
Yeah, it's
dreadful, I know,

23:23.636 --> 23:26.005
but it's absolutely necessary.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.807
(sighs)

23:33.212 --> 23:35.448
As far as it'll go, Dr. Mallard.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.784
Thank you, Dr. Palmer.
Let's see what we have.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.752
No, that can't be right.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.187
What can't be right?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.924
This man's core temperature
is 62 below zero.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.092
How, Duck?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.660
Well, I don't know.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.096
Well, l-let's check it again.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.465
You got the virus, too?

23:52.499 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, there was a worm
functionality embedded

23:54.033 --> 23:56.002
into the virus, which
of course replicated...

23:56.035 --> 23:57.136
I...
(stammers)

23:57.169 --> 23:58.705
Yes, I got the virus, too.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.773
Ah, it's correct.
62 below.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.875
That's nearly 100 degrees
below freezing.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.512
What happened to him?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.747
Well, I wouldn't even venture
a guess until I do the autopsy,

24:07.780 --> 24:11.017
and I can't begin that until
he comes to room temperature.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.720
Oh, not hours,
Jethro. Days.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.221
Oh, come on, Duck.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.824
Rapid defrosting would
cause his skin to decompose

24:17.857 --> 24:19.659
while his inner organs
would stay frozen.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.128
It would seriously
compromise the results.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.162
No, we wait.

24:26.733 --> 24:30.537
Okay, so Bishop is
kicking butt back there.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.171
How you doing?
Any hospitals?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.740
Yes. You know
this is hard to do

24:33.773 --> 24:35.842
with you breathing
over my shoulder.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.877
Do we know how
Clint Asher was frozen?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.712
Liquid nitrogen, Gibbs.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.514
It's the only way.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.882
And lots of it.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.151
Okay, you get back to work,

24:45.184 --> 24:47.153
because this is
my demonstration.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.755
Demonstration?

24:48.788 --> 24:51.290
Liquid nitrogen.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.962
It is a colorless,
clear liquid that's stored

24:55.995 --> 24:58.865
at minus 346 degrees

24:58.898 --> 25:01.934
and immediately boils
whenever it comes in contact

25:01.968 --> 25:03.736
with anything that's warmer.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.173
Abbs.

25:07.206 --> 25:12.612
Okay, so Asher's body
temperature was 62 below.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.847
He was in that lake
for four hours.

25:14.881 --> 25:19.852
The temperature of the lake
was 54 degrees above zero.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.555
The lake warmed him up,

25:22.589 --> 25:26.859
which means he was
extra, extra frozen

25:26.893 --> 25:29.228
when he went into that lake.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.834
That make you feel better?
Oh, yeah.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.103
Just wait until you see what
I can do with a marshmallow.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.104
I get it.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.139
Liquid nitrogen freezes things,

25:40.172 --> 25:41.708
very fast, very cold.

25:41.741 --> 25:42.942
How was Asher frozen?

25:42.975 --> 25:45.211
We don't know
yet, boss, uh,

25:45.244 --> 25:47.213
but it would take
a lot of liquid nitrogen

25:47.246 --> 25:49.348
and a container large enough
to hold a body.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.618
Lots of people
use liquid nitrogen.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.919
There's one major supplier
in the area.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.353
We've been going
through their client list.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.656
It's like hospitals,
dermatologists...

25:56.689 --> 25:58.290
But none of them order
large enough quantities.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.726
BISHOP:
I think

25:59.759 --> 26:01.728
I may have something.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.895
A cryotherapy spa.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.931
Wait, wait, wait,
cryo-what?

26:04.964 --> 26:06.232
It's the latest
fitness craze.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.901
It's like an iced steam bath.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.637
I have been dying to try that.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.938
Like, a girls' night out?
Like, you, me and Quinn?

26:11.971 --> 26:13.372
Yeah, I'm into it.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.808
McGEE: I can't imagine
these spas are cold enough

26:15.842 --> 26:17.076
to freeze Asher's body
like that.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.778
So, there are six
spas in the area.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.747
One that stands out.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.750
It orders five times more
liquid nitrogen than the others.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.384
Let's go. Clock's running.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.954
Bye.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.389
Any more on victim Asher?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.826
Uh, yes, we have his
college transcripts unsealed

26:33.860 --> 26:35.394
and we know why
he was kicked out.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.163
He wrote a ransomware virus
and sent it to his friends.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.931
QUINN: Yeah, he said
it was a joke,

26:38.965 --> 26:41.000
but his dorm mates didn't think
it was very funny, though.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.402
The dorm name:
Elliott Hall.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.205
Wait, Asher created
the Elliott Virus?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.840
QUINN: Ten years ago,
and after that,

26:47.874 --> 26:49.909
he went on the straight and
narrow and went after guys

26:49.942 --> 26:51.778
that he used to be.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.846
His own virus then came out
and he wound up killed.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.881
Who and why?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.885
What do we know about the guy

26:58.918 --> 26:59.819
who rents
the empty storage unit?

26:59.852 --> 27:03.790
Oh, it... sorry. Hello.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.257
TORRES:
Paperwork says David Yates.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.960
Address puts him in
the middle of Potomac.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.361
Phone number
is fake, too.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.429
E-mail's bouncing back.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.964
David Yates is an alias.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.199
Anybody who read
this rental app

27:13.232 --> 27:15.802
could see that...

27:15.835 --> 27:17.436
including
the storage unit manager.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.071
GIBBS: Come on, Torres,
you're with me. Quinn.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.040
Um, uh, Mom.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.676
Yeah. Do what you got to do.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.346
It's like a blast
of arctic air

27:27.379 --> 27:29.716
that sends your body into
fight or flight mode.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.785
All of the blood rushes
to your internal organs,

27:32.819 --> 27:34.253
toxins flow out.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.222
It's really very
invigorating.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.057
Why would anyone
want to do this?

27:38.090 --> 27:39.859
BISHOP:
To decrease inflammation,

27:39.892 --> 27:41.393
speed up muscle recovery,

27:41.427 --> 27:43.029
burn calories.

27:43.062 --> 27:43.996
So I hear.

27:44.030 --> 27:44.997
Yeah, LeBron James does it

27:45.031 --> 27:46.265
after every game.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.266
Lauren here

27:47.299 --> 27:49.001
used to have wrinkles...

27:49.035 --> 27:51.738
now they're gone.
McGEE: Huh.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.040
REESE:
Do you want to try?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.742
McGEE:
What are you saying?

27:55.775 --> 27:58.878
So... you guys go through

27:58.911 --> 28:00.980
a lot of liquid nitrogen
containers?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.049
Yeah, I guess.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.985
I promise you
it's all totally legal.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.754
My manager's on his way.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.989
Oh, Lauren's done.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.024
McGEE: So, how long is
a session typically?

28:12.058 --> 28:13.760
Two minutes?

28:13.793 --> 28:17.296
Uh, three minutes max.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.932
What are you looking for?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.033
We'll know when we see it.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.874
(quietly):
McGee, try to trap me inside.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.342
Hey, what are you doing?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.744
You good?

28:31.778 --> 28:35.247
How many cryobaths
do you get

28:35.281 --> 28:37.049
out of one canister
of liquid nitrogen?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.151
I don't know, like, 15.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.054
Can't we wait
for my manager to get here?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.090
Sorry, we're racing the clock.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.925
That's 525.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.327
So, you get 525
customers a week?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.296
500? No way.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.832
It's more like 80 to 90.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.967
Well, we know that you order
35 canisters a week.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.870
So you figure that's 525 baths.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.339
So what happens to all
the extra liquid nitrogen?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.875
BISHOP:
Reese,

29:02.909 --> 29:04.877
what do you know?

29:04.911 --> 29:07.046
We're not waiting
for your manager.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.316
GIBBS:
Yeah, Bishop.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.085
BISHOP: The manager
of the cryospa is reselling

29:13.119 --> 29:15.354
bottles of liquid nitrogen
at a big markup.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.989
To who?

29:17.023 --> 29:19.959
David Yates,
same guy who supposedly

29:19.992 --> 29:21.260
rented the storage unit.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.895
What's he doing with them?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.031
Finding out now.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.499
I told you,
I don't know who he is.

29:27.533 --> 29:28.968
That's the wrong answer, Buzz.

29:29.001 --> 29:29.969
I don't know every renter.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.304
I've got 260 units.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.073
Well, we have a warrant
that says we can open

29:34.106 --> 29:35.174
each and every
one of them.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.810
(stammers)
You can't do that. No.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.278
Hey. He can't do that.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.146
This roast beef?

29:40.179 --> 29:42.148
Oh, come on, man.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.050
Okay, Buzz, so here's the deal.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.484
We're on a deadline,
which means

29:45.517 --> 29:47.453
we don't have time
to arrest you,

29:47.486 --> 29:51.123
transport you back to NCIS
and interrogate you.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.458
Tell us what you know.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.927
The guy on your
surveillance video--

29:54.961 --> 29:57.063
we found him dead in a lake.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.331
Did Yates do that?

30:01.033 --> 30:04.170
Uh, look, all right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.572
Yates has a second unit,

30:06.605 --> 30:08.040
off the books.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.876
He pays me in cash,

30:09.909 --> 30:13.079
and then he tips me not
to say anything to anyone.

30:13.112 --> 30:16.015
But I swear on my mother's grave

30:16.048 --> 30:18.985
that I don't know
what's in there.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.597
TORRES:
Whoa. What is this guy?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.165
Dr. Jekyll?

30:38.070 --> 30:41.607
It's a homemade cryosauna.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.010
And not for pleasure.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.412
Hey, Nick.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.882
Ether.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.151
Not the pleasure kind, either.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.232
(clears throat)
Gibbs.

31:14.173 --> 31:17.209
Marie. What are you doing?

31:17.243 --> 31:18.978
Damn thing is so sensitive,

31:19.011 --> 31:21.613
it goes off at
the slightest whiff of heat.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.382
Okay, come on. Get down
from there. I'll fix it.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.616
Oh, will you shut up?

31:24.650 --> 31:25.985
QUINN:
Oh. Uh...

31:26.018 --> 31:28.287
Okay. Come on.
All right.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.555
Can you get down?

31:29.588 --> 31:30.689
Yes, I can get down.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.690
I am not an invalid.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.359
Ah.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.161
Okay.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.395
And this thing, this thing,

31:36.428 --> 31:39.198
I had this on low
all day long.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.466
Did not cook.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.135
Put it up to high, that happens.
Mm.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.237
Is anyone listening
to Mother?

31:45.271 --> 31:47.139
Who else is coming?

31:47.173 --> 31:48.540
Who did you invite?
What?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.542
There's three place
settings, Mom.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.611
Yeah. You, me and your dad.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.115
Don't look at me that way.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.616
Come on.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.385
All right,
so he can be stubborn.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.553
If he's stubborn,
you just be the bigger person.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.622
You come in,
you give him a big hug.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.263
Come sit.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.731
Darling, what is it?
What's wrong?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.300
Sit. Just sit.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.539
You know this.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.209
Right?

32:25.277 --> 32:26.612
Marie, you know this.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.048
I know what? What do I know?

32:29.081 --> 32:31.317
That he's dead?

32:35.321 --> 32:37.356
Dad's dead?

32:37.389 --> 32:39.158
You know,
three years ago?

32:39.191 --> 32:41.160
You remember?

32:41.193 --> 32:44.363
Remember? You-you know that.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.065
You live here alone?

32:48.267 --> 32:50.236
(voice breaking):
Yeah, I know.

32:50.269 --> 32:53.205
Of course I know.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.141
Why are you even
telling me that?

32:55.174 --> 32:57.243
Well, you didn't,
you didn't remember.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.313
(voice breaking):
You don't remember a lot.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.252
You know what I remember?

33:06.285 --> 33:09.288
I remember letting you
ditch school in eighth grade,

33:09.321 --> 33:13.192
and taking you to a museum,
and we looked at paintings

33:13.225 --> 33:16.062
of bare naked ladies.
(giggles)

33:16.095 --> 33:17.996
You remember?
Mm-hmm.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.534
Why did he have to go so young?

33:22.568 --> 33:24.536
Oh, God,
I wasn't ready.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.072
No, me neither.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.140
We were making plans
to go to the Caribbean.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.641
You remember we were gonna
buy a boat?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.178
You can't even swim.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.113
You don't need to swim
if you're on a boat.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.114
Mm-hmm.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.382
(both chuckle)

33:36.415 --> 33:38.750
Oh, God, look at me.
I got to get ready.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.386
I'm a mess,
I'm a mess.

33:40.419 --> 33:43.689
Mom, come on, uh, let's eat.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.357
I want to try your ribs.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.659
No, no, no, I can't let your
father see me like this.

33:47.693 --> 33:48.694
It's his birthday
after all.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.486
Um, Earl Grey?

34:14.520 --> 34:17.156
What are you two doing?
Nothing.

34:17.189 --> 34:20.159
No, these poor souls are
literally frozen in time.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.162
Wow. It's like
a science fiction movie.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.330
No, it's very real.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.498
What your self-storage
guy is doing is called

34:26.532 --> 34:27.799
cryogenics.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.768
It's the ultra-low
temperature preservation

34:29.801 --> 34:31.137
of human bodies,

34:31.170 --> 34:32.704
in the hopes that
they can be resuscitated

34:32.738 --> 34:34.840
one day
in the future when...

34:34.873 --> 34:38.577
I don't know, death isn't
quite so inevitable?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.779
And that could be in centuries.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.481
Yeah. Doesn't stop
people from trying.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.882
Like Ted Williams.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.651
Ted Williams, greatest
pure hitter in baseball.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.419
Marine fighter pilot.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.889
Perhaps he's hoping to one day
take the field again.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.392
Wait, cryogenics is legal?
JIMMY: Yep.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.693
There's over
250 bodies

34:54.726 --> 34:56.595
cryogenically frozen
in the United States.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.765
DUCKY: Well, those are in
legitimate facilities,

34:59.798 --> 35:02.201
(chuckles):
not in self-storage units.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.803
So if it's not against the
law, why hide these two?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.838
We found traces of
microbial metabolites

35:06.872 --> 35:08.707
on the outer dermis.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.610
And that tells us
when those men were frozen,

35:11.643 --> 35:13.545
they were still alive.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.447
And that means that
you are dealing

35:15.481 --> 35:18.116
with a dangerous
psychopath.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.853
Special Agent McGee.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.755
Vice Admiral Chase.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.557
How's the case going?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.893
Uh, well, it's taken
a sharp left turn.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.728
Yeah, we are
way past hacking.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.863
The vice admiral's well aware;
I've kept him up to speed.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.865
Mm.
He's actually here
for another reason.

35:35.967 --> 35:40.172
Yes, well, um...
I want to apologize.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.541
I let ego
and obstinance

35:42.574 --> 35:44.510
get in the way of logic.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.846
Those photos are too important
to stand on principle.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.948
I'd like to pay the ransom.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.651
For myself and
all who I infected.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.721
Here.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.690
Oh. Thank you for
the apology, Admiral,

35:58.724 --> 36:00.392
but I wouldn't
pay just yet.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.394
We still have 90 minutes left.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.563
Did we I.D. the bodies?
Two homeless men,

36:04.596 --> 36:06.698
disappeared separately
more than a year ago.

36:06.732 --> 36:07.933
Any connection to Clint Asher?
No.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.835
Or with ransomware.
McGEE: There's more.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.537
Asher wasn't the only one
kicked out of college

36:11.570 --> 36:13.339
for the ransomware prank.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.840
His roommate was
expelled, too.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.575
Together they created
the Elliott Virus.

36:16.608 --> 36:17.909
Carlo Hackett.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.878
Human developmental
biology major.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.514
He wrote a science fiction
blog, and his senior thesis

36:22.548 --> 36:23.649
was on cryogenics.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.351
Carlo went on to
become a lab tech.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.486
Worked in a blood bank
until he was fired

36:27.519 --> 36:28.820
six months ago
for theft.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.256
Liquid nitrogen?

36:30.289 --> 36:31.823
He needed a constant supply.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.759
And Cryoenergy Day Spa
became the new source.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.728
He cut a deal with the manager
to buy the extra canisters.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.964
Liquid nitrogen's expensive, so
he dug out the ransomware virus

36:38.997 --> 36:41.567
him and Clint Asher
created in college.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.935
Carlo Hackett and David Yates
are the same guy?

36:43.969 --> 36:45.904
I hooked up Buzz with
a sketch artist to draw Yates.

36:45.937 --> 36:46.938
Here's what we got.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.244
Let's go get him.
No.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.879
He's coming to us.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.668
Hello, Carlo.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.272
Freeze.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.374
(chuckles) See what
I did there? "Freeze."

37:23.542 --> 37:24.876
Clever.
McGEE: Hey, boss,

37:24.910 --> 37:25.977
Clint Asher logged
on last night.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.479
Looks like
his last act

37:27.513 --> 37:28.814
was to try and
shut down the virus.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.649
He's gonna finish
what he started.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.352
Mr. Hackett, password, please.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.720
And if I refuse?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.988
A shower. A cold one.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.680
That's it?
That's it.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.953
Where are they?

38:07.986 --> 38:11.590
Answer me,
where are my test subjects?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.024
You mean
your victims?

38:13.058 --> 38:14.826
They're on our medical
examiner's table.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.796
You can't do that.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.065
If you thaw them out,
you'll kill them.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.933
You already
killed them.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.102
You don't get it.

38:24.135 --> 38:28.340
I put them into a state
of suspended animation.

38:28.374 --> 38:30.876
And I will bring them back.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.013
BISHOP:
Your college roommate,

38:35.046 --> 38:38.350
Clint, was shocked when he saw

38:38.384 --> 38:41.553
the virus you both created
was back online.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.888
REEVES:
You took him to your lab,

38:42.921 --> 38:44.890
where you froze him
in your ice chamber.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.125
Cancer patients.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.762
I could put them into
a state of hibernation.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.532
And when science
has cured cancer,

38:53.565 --> 38:57.035
my test subjects can live
healthy, productive lives.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.504
They're not
test subjects.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.971
Couple of homeless guys,
and you froze them

39:00.005 --> 39:01.607
while they were
still alive.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.041
I had to; if you wait
until they're dead,

39:03.074 --> 39:04.109
you can never bring them back.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.513
Get up.
Where are you taking me?

39:07.546 --> 39:08.680
Into hibernation.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.915
Look...

39:09.948 --> 39:12.918
you know that they
locked up Galileo, too.

39:12.951 --> 39:16.555
Today they call him
the father of astronomy.

39:25.764 --> 39:29.100
That's my grandma.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.538
Oh, God, I loved her.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.607
Uh, now, she went senile.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.909
That's what they used call it
back in those days, "senile."

39:37.943 --> 39:39.945
Nobody-nobody calls it
that anymore.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.613
(sighs)

39:41.647 --> 39:43.549
Well, apparently it
skips a generation,

39:43.582 --> 39:46.485
which is good news
for you, baby.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.489
Mom, how, uh...

39:50.522 --> 39:54.092
how long have you known
about forgetting things?

39:57.463 --> 39:59.465
I've known for awhile.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.670
I-I...

40:04.703 --> 40:09.941
I make a telephone call, and
I'd forget who I was talking to.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.978
Or I go... out for a walk,

40:13.011 --> 40:17.048
and I-I would get lost
in my own neighborhood.

40:21.086 --> 40:25.457
It's like a window that just
keeps closing a little bit,

40:25.491 --> 40:27.526
and then a
little bit more.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.928
Every day.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.097
Like that.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.099
Well, we're not gonna
let it close, okay?

40:34.132 --> 40:38.003
Baby, nobody stops this window.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.237
Nobody.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.006
We're not nobody.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.575
Okay? We-we... we fight.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.845
And I am not putting you
in a nursing home.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.246
I am here for you.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.849
I know you are.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.251
But what happens when
I'm not here for you anymore?

40:53.284 --> 40:56.087
Forgetting about your
dad was bad enough.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.190
But what happens...

40:59.224 --> 41:01.927
(crying):
when I forget who you are?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.629
You won't.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.196
You're not going to.
How can you?

41:05.230 --> 41:09.200
I mean, come on, you're not
gonna forget about me.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.236
(sobbing)

41:13.104 --> 41:16.274
I just don't want to live
to be a burden.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.210
You are not a burden.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.947
You're my mother.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.986
She ain't heavy, Father.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.054
BOTH:
She's my mother.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.956
(both laugh)
Come here, you.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.258
Oh, my baby.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.261
Baby, oh, my baby, baby.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.164
FIRING LINE COMMANDER:
Cease fire.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.733
Make sure
the firing lane is safe

41:41.767 --> 41:44.169
before going down range
to score your targets.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.209
How's your mom?

41:51.242 --> 41:52.744
Uh, yeah.

41:52.778 --> 41:54.580
Like she says,

41:54.613 --> 41:58.817
if life is a bowl of cherries,
why do I always get the pits?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.852
Yeah, you know what?
I never got that.

42:00.886 --> 42:04.590
If you got a bowl full of pits,
it means you ate the cherries.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.991
Yeah.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.258
(chuckles)

42:11.096 --> 42:14.866
Yeah, it's just, uh...
came on so quick.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.302
You know, she was
good at hiding it,

42:17.335 --> 42:19.304
I was good at denying it.

42:23.074 --> 42:26.011
Hey, Quinn,
it's okay to be scared.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.779
Yeah, I know.

42:29.815 --> 42:32.350
I'm moving back
in with her.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.585
How's that for scary?
