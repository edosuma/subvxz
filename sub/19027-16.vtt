WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.333
(beeping)

00:05.834 --> 00:06.834
What is that?

00:06.917 --> 00:09.166
This here is an electronic
hide-and-seek game.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.500
The other person
wears a sensor,

00:10.583 --> 00:12.583
and the closer you get,
the more it beeps.

00:12.667 --> 00:13.709
Huh. Funsies.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.542
So Mrs. Factor here
has an aortitis,

00:15.625 --> 00:17.333
and, Turk, this'll need
a surgical consult.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Fire away.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.792
-See her red highlights?
-Yes.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.792
Could I pull those off,
or am I so kidding myself?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.166
I really don't have time for this.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.375
Turk, you're playing
hide-and-seek.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.125
With my 9-year-old
glioblastoma patient, Eric.

00:30.208 --> 00:31.542
He's been in
the hospital for a month.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.291
I think he deserves a little fun,
don't you?

00:34.083 --> 00:35.583
Sorry, Turk. Sorry.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.125
(beeping)

00:38.208 --> 00:40.542
Ah hee hee hoo!

00:42.875 --> 00:44.375
How bad would she look
with red highlights?

00:44.458 --> 00:46.125
I know. It is now my turn to hide.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.375
I'll count. Close a brother up.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.792
So I like to remember all the carpal
bones in the hand

00:53.875 --> 00:55.500
with a simple pneumonic device.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.417
Scaphoid, lunate,
triquetral, pisiform,

00:57.500 --> 00:59.834
trapezium, trapezoid, capitate
and hamate.

00:59.917 --> 01:01.333
Some lovers try positions

01:01.417 --> 01:03.542
-that they can't handle.
-Hey.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.709
That was not directed at you,
doctor.

01:05.792 --> 01:09.250
But you should stretch first next
time we try the whirlybird.

01:09.333 --> 01:10.458
Excuse me.

01:10.542 --> 01:14.041
Does anyone here happen
to have a plate of jeebees?

01:14.125 --> 01:17.542
Because these two just gave me a big
ol' scoop of the heebees.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.750
Seriously, it cannot just be me.

01:20.834 --> 01:23.041
I wanna hear from the audience.
I do.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.667
Dating in the workplace.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.125
She's the boss.
He's the pretty intern.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.542
Tell me what's bugging you. Courage.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.792
(clears throat)

01:32.333 --> 01:36.125
Well, sometimes they arrive in the
morning and they smell like sex.

01:37.667 --> 01:41.792
Gloria, telling it like it smells.

01:41.875 --> 01:46.291
-I'm proud of you.
-Barbie, who hurt you?

01:47.417 --> 01:50.500
-Is there something you want?
-Actually, yes.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.500
It is one of those rare days where
you can be of use to me.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.083
You speak German.
I have a patient from Berlin,

01:56.166 --> 01:59.041
and I need to tell the gentleman
that he has fluid in his lungs.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.834
(speaking German)

02:01.917 --> 02:03.500
(repeating in German)

02:03.583 --> 02:05.041
(correcting in German)

02:06.041 --> 02:08.625
(speaking German)
Your wife has nice cans.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.417
(speaking German)

02:11.500 --> 02:13.041
Nice cans.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.417
How are you?

02:16.125 --> 02:17.667
(cell phone rings)

02:19.041 --> 02:21.959
Relax, dude. Just playing a little
electronic hide-and-seek.

02:22.834 --> 02:23.834
Hey, baby.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.709
Yeah, I know my shift's over, b--

02:27.458 --> 02:30.000
No, I'm not fooling around with J.D.
I'm--

02:30.625 --> 02:32.291
Ok, cool. I'm on my way home.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.583
All right, I just took the pregnancy
test.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.625
Just tell me
when a minute's up.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.166
I just put some pizza rolls
in the microwave oven.

02:42.625 --> 02:45.333
The minute that bad boy dings,
we're good to go.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.208
Oh, my God. I can't stand it.
30 more seconds.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.291
Ok, honey, don't get too excited.

02:51.375 --> 02:54.709
They have to cool off for at least a
minute. That cheese is like lava.

02:54.792 --> 02:57.500
Is there a bigger idiot
than you in the entire world?

03:00.583 --> 03:03.250
I'm seeking you, Turk.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.291
(beep)

03:09.083 --> 03:10.250
It's negative.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.333
Look at me.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.792
Hey. Look at me.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.291
It's gonna happen.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.000
Eat your pizza rolls.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.208
I got to get to work.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.458
By the way,

03:31.542 --> 03:35.166
next time buy a name-brand pregnancy
test, not that cheap generic one.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.333
If you raise my allowance,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.834
I wouldn't have to bargain shop
so I could buy pizza rolls.

03:39.208 --> 03:42.000
Secondly, this pregnancy test
works just as well

03:42.083 --> 03:43.417
as the name-brand one.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.041
Wait a second.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.333
"Results in 3 minutes."

03:52.250 --> 03:54.458
(J.D.) <i>Some things deserve to be</i>
<i>tossed out on their asses.</i>

03:55.875 --> 03:57.417
(speaking same German phase)

03:59.208 --> 04:01.458
(J.D.) <i>But the thing you shouldn't</i>
<i>toss out is a pregnancy test</i>

04:01.542 --> 04:04.291
<i>that takes 2 minutes</i>
<i>longer than you thought.</i>

04:07.458 --> 04:09.125
Oh, my God. We're pregnant.

04:14.792 --> 04:17.667
Aah-ha! Aah! Aah!

04:17.750 --> 04:21.083
♪<i> I can't do this</i>
<i>All on my own </i>♪

04:21.166 --> 04:22.667
♪ <i>No, I know </i>♪

04:22.750 --> 04:24.333

04:27.959 --> 04:29.583
♪<i> I'm no Superman </i>♪

04:32.834 --> 04:36.000
Mr. Roberts and I just love our
pool.

04:36.083 --> 04:38.917
In high school, I was
actually all-state swimmer.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.417
Breaststroke five.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.375
Maybe later.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.959
(J.D.) <i>Every workplace</i>

04:44.041 --> 04:45.875

04:46.250 --> 04:49.834
When I was 19, I was a world-class
110-meter hurdler.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.417
I still remember the nationals
like they were yesterday.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.709
Runners, take your position.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.625
On your mark...

05:03.166 --> 05:04.166
set...

05:10.166 --> 05:16.333
(theme from <i>Chariots of Fire</i>
playing)

05:24.458 --> 05:25.542
Great.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.083
They offered me a full ride to
Grambling,

05:29.166 --> 05:31.417
but then I slept with the
President's daughter.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.625
Not the college President.
The President of the United States.

05:35.166 --> 05:38.458
But hey, if Amy Carter asks you up
for a nightcap, you do not say no.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.542
No. No more.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.834
Here are some of the lies you've
told us over the last 5 years.

05:44.917 --> 05:45.917
You went to Harvard.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
You have a wife who only
has a pointer and thumb pinky.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.208
You have a brother, dad,
a mother, sister.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.125
You have 2 kids.
No, wait. You have 1 kid.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.709
No, you had a baby with a Chinese
local. You're a deaf mute.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.709
Oh, wait. Now you're telling us that
you're a world-class hurdler

05:59.792 --> 06:04.166
and you slept with the beautiful
and irreplaceable Amy Carter?

06:04.250 --> 06:06.250
I didn't sleep with Amy Carter.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.375
We did everything but.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.000
(groans)

06:10.083 --> 06:11.500
And I really was
a world-class hurdler.

06:11.583 --> 06:15.000
-We're not buying it, are we, gang?
-No.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.917
The people have spoken.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.250
Allow me to bask in the glow.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.166
Oh, J.D., guess what.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.834
-Not now, Turk. I'm glow-basking.
-Dude, listen to me.

06:27.709 --> 06:32.417
Yee-ha!

06:32.500 --> 06:35.125
-Where is Carla?
-She just went downstairs.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.667
What is all the excitement?

06:36.750 --> 06:39.917
You tell him. Ok, you tell him.

06:40.542 --> 06:41.750
We're having a baby.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.667
The red states be damned. I'm sure
you're gonna make great fathers.

06:45.583 --> 06:49.375
-What's going on?
-My turn. Carla prego.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.750
Oh, my God. Turk.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.375
Carla must be so happy.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.041
I haven't told her yet.
I'm gonna go tell her now.

06:56.125 --> 07:00.333
Wait, Turk. When has a man
ever been able to tell his wife

07:00.417 --> 07:01.500
that she's pregnant?

07:02.291 --> 07:05.208
Allow me to paint you a picture
with my imagination brush. Ok?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.000
You two come out in the parking lot

07:07.083 --> 07:09.166
where all Carla's friends
have gathered.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.125
They're holding a giant banner

07:11.208 --> 07:15.375
that says, "Carla, you're pregnant,
and I dove you."

07:15.458 --> 07:17.542
Did I say "dove"? I did, Turk.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.667
That's when I cue the bird wrangler

07:19.750 --> 07:22.750
who releases 500 white doves
into the air.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.542
Where do they land?
I don't know.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.208
But one thing Carla knows--

07:26.625 --> 07:30.750
that in her uterus is
a little, soft baby, Turk.

07:31.750 --> 07:32.750
Are you forgetting what happened

07:32.834 --> 07:35.041
when you made me have doves at my
parents' anniversary party?

07:35.125 --> 07:36.375
This won't be indoors, Turk,

07:36.458 --> 07:38.625
and there certainly won't be all
those people throwing birdseed.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.625
Why were people
throwing seed? It's a...

07:41.250 --> 07:42.709
The point is that you, my friend,

07:42.792 --> 07:45.125
have a chance to be
on the greatest surprise

07:45.208 --> 07:47.542
a husband has ever
pulled for his wife...

07:48.041 --> 07:51.166
and you'll get credit for it the
length of your entire marriage.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.500
I'm in.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.625
Great. I'll tell everybody.
You find Carla.

07:54.709 --> 07:57.875
-Dr. Cox--
-Halt. I will be doing nothing.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.000
Well, you at least won't tell Carla,
right?

08:02.250 --> 08:03.834
Ever since I was blitzkrieged
this morning

08:03.917 --> 08:05.667
by an enraged German named Otto,

08:05.750 --> 08:07.834
a certain Dr. Barbie
no longer exists for me.

08:07.917 --> 08:10.083
So if she were to ask me a question,

08:10.166 --> 08:12.834
I wouldn't be able to hear it
and you'd have to repeat it.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.000
Can you just please not tell Carla?

08:15.083 --> 08:16.208
Fine.

08:16.291 --> 08:19.291
And, Elliot, if you see Carla,
don't get emotional.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.709
No problem.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.166
Really? Baby.

08:23.250 --> 08:27.875
Oh, my God, Turk.
Carla is gonna be so happy.

08:29.834 --> 08:33.000
The family wants me to do a hip
surgery. What are they thinking?

08:33.458 --> 08:34.834
The guy's 92.

08:34.917 --> 08:37.500
He's their grandfather.
It's not like he's a dog

08:37.583 --> 08:39.917
and they can go to a kennel
and pick out another one.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.083
We just got a lot of great
new grandfathers in.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.917
Ok. Ooh, look at this one.
He's so cute.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.250
Hey. Get out of my yard.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.000
He's not good with people.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.125
He's great, but we really
don't wanna separate them.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.208
I already have a grandma.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.291
If I get one this little,
everybody's gonna think I'm gay.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.542
Oh, look at this fellow.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.542
Come here, boy.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.333
I got a little hard candy for you.

09:16.417 --> 09:19.250
Come here. Yes. Good boy.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.667
Who's a good boy?

09:20.750 --> 09:24.125
You got a candy you can
unwrap in a movie theater.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.458
I'd name him Sebastian.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.375
Hey, what's up with the janitor?

09:29.458 --> 09:31.959
He seems a little more
lurky than usual.

09:32.041 --> 09:35.000
I pissed him off earlier today.
How am I supposed to avoid him?

09:35.083 --> 09:37.125
You should put the hide-and-seek
sensor on him.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.250
That way you'll always
know where he is.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.792
It would take a very clever plan

09:41.875 --> 09:45.000
to hide this tiny
penny-like sensor on him.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.500
5 bucks if you eat this penny.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.667
Done. And done.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.166
We pulled it off. See if it works.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.667
(beeping)

09:57.750 --> 10:00.542
My friend, we have just
lo-jacked the janitor.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.542
Hello.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.625
Dr. Cox, I've got a patient
with osteomyelitis

10:05.709 --> 10:07.583
who needs a bone biopsy.
Who do you use?

10:07.667 --> 10:09.834
You put me in an awkward spot

10:09.917 --> 10:12.333
because I'm a healer
and I want to help,

10:12.417 --> 10:14.500
but speaking to you would
acknowledge your existence

10:14.583 --> 10:15.583
and you don't exist.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.083
So I'm going to address the stapler.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.166
Hi, stapler.
The red is killer.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.000
By the way, there's
a certain Dr. Brownsfield

10:24.083 --> 10:26.709
who is just the most
wonderful bone guy.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.750
What? What's that, stapler?

10:28.834 --> 10:32.208
Oh, no.
She's an actual doctor.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.083
Neither of you are very funny.

10:34.166 --> 10:38.250
-Elliot, here are your lab results.
-Oh, my God. Carla.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.500
-Elliot, honey, what's wrong?
-Yeah, Elliot, honey. What's wrong?

10:41.583 --> 10:46.083
Nothing. I'm just very emotional
because, um,

10:47.500 --> 10:48.625
Keith dumped me.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.500
I have to go.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.542
Another one.

10:52.917 --> 10:53.917
Shoot.

10:56.041 --> 10:59.959
Keith, I, uh, have been watching you
and you've got some potential.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.417
You do. But can I give you
one piece of advice?

11:02.500 --> 11:05.917
-Please.
-It is all about confidence.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.125
Hell, be a cocky bastard.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.041
Throw 'em a wink
every once in a while.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.291
Show me a wink. Show me the wink.
Give me the wink.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.125
That's the guy.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.667
That's the guy
who broke our friend's heart.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.083
Well, hey, he's
probably hurting, too.

11:21.458 --> 11:25.041
-Hey, baby.
-Oh, no, he did not just wink at me.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.709
For the next 5 minutes,
I am not a nurse.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.458
Carla, there is a better way.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't like it,

11:31.083 --> 11:35.250
but Jordan tells her friends
intimate details about me--

11:35.333 --> 11:38.000
our sex lives,
parenting deficiencies.

11:38.083 --> 11:42.417
The point is, I'm sure Elliot
has told you things about Keith.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.417
So instead of yelling at him,
why not calmly let him know

11:46.500 --> 11:49.792
that you know things
that he thinks no one knows.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.083
Oh, Keith.
Mind taking a walk with me?

11:54.166 --> 11:55.667
Yeah.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.917
-Is Carla gone?
-Yeah. She sure is.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.750
-Oh, my God.
-Say, Barbie? We're even.

12:05.542 --> 12:06.542
Oh, no.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.000
All right, everybody,
before Carla arrives,

12:10.083 --> 12:11.917
I wanna thank you all for turning
out.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.917
Especially you, father Rosenberg.

12:14.625 --> 12:15.792
Incidentally, when all this is over,

12:15.875 --> 12:18.375
I'd love to get the back story
on that name of yours, ok?

12:18.709 --> 12:21.375
-(beeping)
-Excuse me.

12:21.458 --> 12:27.208
(beeping)

12:27.291 --> 12:28.583
Ok, coming through.

12:28.667 --> 12:33.125
Now, apparently, they don't have
fetus balloons. Who knew?

12:33.208 --> 12:35.208
So, what I've done is
I've attached string

12:35.291 --> 12:37.625
to the belly buttons
of these baby balloons

12:37.709 --> 12:40.083
to signify the umbilical cord.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.583
Make sure everybody gets one.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.291
Keith, you seemed to have missed
the point here.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.959
We're not really broken up.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.792
I just can't believe you told Carla

12:48.875 --> 12:50.750
that I made out with
my sister in the 6th grade.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.250
I don't understand why you're so
embarrassed about that.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.959
I've met Denise. She's gorgeous.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.834
We're just gonna have
to face the fact

12:57.917 --> 13:01.500
that you might not get pregnant
for a very, very, very long time.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.333
I know it's gonna happen, Turk.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.041
And you know what I'm
looking forward to the most?

13:05.125 --> 13:06.542
-What's that?
-When we can go around

13:06.625 --> 13:10.291
to our friends and I can tell them
one by one, "I'm pregnant."

13:10.750 --> 13:13.792
I can't wait to see the look of
surprise on each one of their faces.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.458
I think about it every day.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.709
Anybody tries to take
those moments away from me,

13:18.792 --> 13:19.792
I'll kill 'em.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.000
Me, too.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.000
Just need to send a quick text.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.166
Oh, no. We got a glitch.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.125
Abort the plan. Abort the surprise!

13:32.208 --> 13:33.583
Abort the babies!

13:34.750 --> 13:36.500
Everybody run!

13:46.166 --> 13:48.500
Sorry about the whole
"abort the babies" thing.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.542
Actually, I'm pro-choice.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.750
(J.D.)<i> Knowing someone's pregnant</i>

13:58.834 --> 14:01.583
<i>when they don't know it themselves</i>
<i>can get a bit complicated.</i>

14:01.667 --> 14:02.875
Let me take that from you.

14:02.959 --> 14:05.041
Um, you left the fridge open.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.500
-Oh!
-Ah, I spilled it.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.417
-I'll get another one.
-Sorry.

14:11.959 --> 14:12.959
What are you doing?

14:13.041 --> 14:14.458
I may have gotten overexcited

14:14.542 --> 14:16.959
and told one or two of her family
members that she's pregnant.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.458
(voice)<i> You have 59 messages.</i>

14:19.542 --> 14:20.709
(beep)

14:21.417 --> 14:23.417
Turk, the answering
machine's broken.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.959
And I don't think
we have any more wine.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.709
Turk, can I have some of yours?

14:27.792 --> 14:30.792
(J.D.) <i>I feel Turk was starting</i>
<i>to blame me for all of this.</i>

14:33.166 --> 14:35.750
I spilled mine, too, honey.
You know what you should do?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.041
Ask for some of J.D.'s.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.166
Spilled mine, too.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.750
I'm going to bed.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.166
What are you gonna do?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.083
I'm gonna tell her the truth

14:49.166 --> 14:50.875
and hope she's so tired from being
pregnant

14:50.959 --> 14:51.959
that she doesn't have the strength

14:52.041 --> 14:53.709
to kick my ass
for more than a few hours.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.041
Wait, Turk. I have an idea.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.959
You have another idea, huh?
Well, I got to tell you.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.792
I'm done with your ideas.
And not just now, but forever.

15:01.875 --> 15:04.458
-Ok? Are we clear on that?
-It's a good'UN.

15:04.542 --> 15:05.542
I'm listening.

15:06.792 --> 15:09.458
Ok, we need Carla to find out
if she's pregnant on her own.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.375
And we need your help.
Can we count on you?

15:11.458 --> 15:12.917
-Absolutely not.
-No way in hell.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Who's pregnant?

15:14.083 --> 15:15.875
We go down,
we're taking you with us.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.834
-What?
-Why?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.458
Would somebody please
tell me who's pregnant?

15:20.542 --> 15:22.125
-Carla.
-Another kid?

15:22.208 --> 15:23.917
My God.
How many does that make?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.458
This is her first one.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.250
If you say so, son.

15:27.333 --> 15:30.083
-You can't blackmail us.
-Really?

15:30.709 --> 15:34.542
Because I think you're both very
close to Carla, aren't you?

15:34.625 --> 15:37.208
And yet you chose not to tell her
she was pregnant.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.917
Turk, how would that go down for
'em?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.458
Unpleasantly.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.959
Unpleasantly.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.417
Ha. He got you two
by the short ones.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.709
Dr. Kelso, it's true
you didn't know anything,

15:46.792 --> 15:48.458
but I'm willing to bet
that these guys would swear

15:48.542 --> 15:49.542
on their life that you did.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.375
-On my life.
-Definitely.

15:51.458 --> 15:52.709
Well played, Turkelton.

15:52.792 --> 15:55.542
-Thank you.
-Ok. Listen up.

15:55.625 --> 15:58.375
Everyone in the hospital
knows Carla's pregnant,

15:58.458 --> 16:01.000
but they don't know
she doesn't know.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.458
We need her to find out on her own
before anyone congratulates her.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.208
Ok? Here's the plan.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.208
The three of us are
gonna run interference.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.792
Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso,

16:09.875 --> 16:12.458
I need you to get her to take
another pregnancy test.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.750
This plan is foolproof.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.417
That's impossible.
You two are involved.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.166
Yeah, we'll see about that.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.583
-You go left.
-Ok. That was right.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.208
Actually, I need to come with you.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.000
Where's Carla?

16:26.083 --> 16:28.959
Uh, she went up to the roof
to get some air.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.125
Oh.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.458
-Follow her. Lock her up there.
-You got it.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.709
(beeping)

16:38.792 --> 16:41.500
Hello, janitor,
hiding around the corner,

16:41.583 --> 16:43.000
waiting to grab me.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.125
How did you know
that was me?

16:45.208 --> 16:47.625
I'm holding
a GPS warning device

16:47.709 --> 16:50.000
that goes off whenever you come
within a hundred meters of me.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.917
It's responding to a tiny sensor
in your stomach.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.458
I knew that wasn't a penny.

16:54.542 --> 16:57.125
-You'll never get anywhere near me.
-We'll see.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.125
-Yeah, we will see.
-Oh, we're gonna see.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.166
-The only thing left to do is see.
-You're gonna pay.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.041
-We'll see.
-No time.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.208
Ok, bye.

17:06.750 --> 17:11.166
Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso,
look who I've got.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.875
Hey. Carla.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.125
You're glowing.

17:14.792 --> 17:15.834
Really?

17:15.917 --> 17:18.375
Nurse Espinoza,
have your breasts gotten bigger?

17:18.458 --> 17:20.875
Whoa. Dr. Kelso,
that is inappropriate.

17:21.709 --> 17:23.750
Baby, that sounds like
a compliment to me.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.000
Maybe you're just a little hormonal.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.625
Well done, Bob.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.959
A little direct,
but I definitely think

17:32.041 --> 17:33.875
we put the idea
of pregnancy in her head.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.208
Oh, is that what we were doing?
I was just making conversation.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.667
-I have been a little moody.
-Yes, you have been.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.166
Plus, this morning I was nauseous,

17:42.250 --> 17:44.417
but I thought it was the pizza rolls
I had for breakfast.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.583
Yes, I like them.
We can get them from now on.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.709
Still, Turk, do you think
that I should go home

17:49.792 --> 17:51.375
and take another pregnancy test?

17:51.709 --> 17:52.959
It's your call, baby.

17:54.709 --> 17:58.792
Hey! Somebody
get me down from here!

17:58.875 --> 18:00.041
What's she yelling about?

18:00.125 --> 18:02.542
I don't know. I'll have someone from
the psych ward check her out.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.000
Hey, Dr. Dorian, I got
those batteries you asked for.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.291
(J.D.)<i> I was a little anxious,</i>

18:10.375 --> 18:12.875
<i>because it was time to change</i>
<i>Mr. Beeper's batteries.</i>

18:12.959 --> 18:15.959
<i>All clear to the left.</i>
<i>All clear to the right.</i>

18:16.542 --> 18:18.041
<i>You can do this.</i>

18:18.667 --> 18:19.875
He's a hundred meters away,

18:19.959 --> 18:22.625
and it's gonna take him at least
10 seconds to change those batteries.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.375
That's not even a world-record pace.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.375
Ready, set,

18:27.458 --> 18:28.458
go.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.291
(beeping)

18:44.375 --> 18:45.834
Time.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.375
Still got it.

18:50.583 --> 18:51.583
(J.D.)<i> As I lay there</i>

18:51.667 --> 18:56.458
<i>watching nurse Roberts hammer-throw</i>
<i>23 pounds of high-end fruit my way,</i>

18:56.542 --> 18:58.500
<i>I could take solace in one thing.</i>

19:01.208 --> 19:02.291
We're having a baby.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.875
Ha ha! Ha ha!

19:08.125 --> 19:09.125
(J.D.) <i>Any second now,</i>

19:09.208 --> 19:11.458
<i>Carla and Turk were coming</i>
<i>to tell me they were pregnant,</i>

19:11.542 --> 19:14.291
<i>and Carla had to believe</i>
<i>that I was truly surprised.</i>

19:14.375 --> 19:16.583
<i>I was the linchpin of our plan.</i>

19:16.667 --> 19:17.834
Hey, J.D.

19:17.917 --> 19:20.750
-(J.D.) <i>Show time.</i>
-We have such big news.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.333
What's the scoop? I would have no
clue what it could be.

19:23.417 --> 19:24.500
We're having a baby.

19:25.083 --> 19:28.125
(J.D.) <i>Now give them the 10-minute</i>
<i>emotional roller-coaster ride</i>

19:28.208 --> 19:30.792
<i>that is the speech you've</i>
<i>been practicing all afternoon.</i>

19:30.875 --> 19:33.583
Carla, when Turk first told me, I--

19:33.667 --> 19:35.917
What do you mean
when Turk first told you?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.166
Oh, boy.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.750
Uh, we've known for a day.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.291
That pregnancy test you
took yesterday was positive.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.667
I wanted to have everybody
at the hospital gather outside

19:49.750 --> 19:51.291
to surprise you
with balloons and stuff.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.709
What would you have
thought of doves?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.041
J.D., not now.

19:55.583 --> 19:58.333
I just wanted to do
something really memorable.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.291
I messed that up.

20:01.375 --> 20:04.417
-So everybody already knows?
-Mm-hmm.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.667
(J.D.) <i>Then I witnessed one of those</i>
<i>moments</i>

20:06.750 --> 20:08.166
<i>that let me know in my heart</i>

20:08.250 --> 20:10.583
<i>that these two would</i>
<i>be together forever.</i>

20:11.500 --> 20:12.750
Who cares?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.500
We're having a baby.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.834
-We're having a baby.
-Yeah, we are.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.333
-A baby.
-Yeah.

20:22.417 --> 20:25.166
-A little you.
-With a lot of you.

20:37.291 --> 20:38.542
It's ok.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.333
I already know.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.125
