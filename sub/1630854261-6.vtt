08:51.906 --> 08:54.242
-Hey.
-You know Simone?

08:54.283 --> 08:56.410
We're teammates
on the tennis squad,

08:56.452 --> 08:58.412
and now, since
she's made Top 6,

08:58.454 --> 09:00.164
we're practically
sisters.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.999
I would not describe
what we are as sisters. I--

09:02.041 --> 09:03.376
Did y'all know
that Simone won

09:03.417 --> 09:04.669
Player of the Week
from the conference?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.837
-Oh.
-Truly a rising star.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.006
It was nothing,
really.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.259
No.
It's inspiring,

09:11.300 --> 09:12.677
especially with all
the time you spend

09:12.718 --> 09:14.470
mentoring young
tennis players.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.264
I love watching
you rise

09:16.305 --> 09:19.725
because there's room
for all of us to shine.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.104
-OK. It's giving.
-Ah! Ha ha ha!

09:23.145 --> 09:24.772
All right. All right.
Let's get back to it.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.607
Yep.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.119
Aqueelah: OK, ladies.
Let's meet back here tomorrow.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.540
We'll go deliver the backpacks.
Thank you so much for your time.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.458
Hey, Aqueelah,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.168
I'm really glad
I came.

09:46.210 --> 09:46.836
This is such
a great cause.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.004
Thank you.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.505
I hope to see you
tomorrow.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.549
Oh, you will.
I just need the time.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.426
Which I gave at
the start of the meeting.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.969
If you hadn't
been late,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.220
then you wouldn't have
missed the information,

09:56.262 --> 09:57.430
but women like Tootie
showed up

09:57.471 --> 09:59.181
two hours early
to help us.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.684
Well, I'm sorry
I was late, but I--

10:01.726 --> 10:03.477
If you're genuinely
interested,

10:03.519 --> 10:05.313
you'll figure out
what time we're meeting.

10:05.354 --> 10:09.150
I hope you rise
to the challenge.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.324
Get a chance to look over
those talking points

10:16.365 --> 10:18.367
for our recruitment
presentation?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.620
Yeah. I did, and I
have some thoughts.

10:20.661 --> 10:21.996
Few of the recruits
asked me

10:22.038 --> 10:23.581
why am I no longer
head coach,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.124
and I think we
should use the truth

10:25.166 --> 10:26.834
about my medical leave
as a way to talk

10:26.876 --> 10:29.295
about the mental-wellness
resources we offer.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.464
Look.
That's important.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.135
I agree that mental
health is important,

10:36.177 --> 10:37.637
but the key
to any sales pitch

10:37.678 --> 10:39.430
is to keep things
positive.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.308
OK.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.851
Thea: My orthopedist
said there's still

10:43.893 --> 10:45.353
too much inflammation
in my shoulder,

10:45.394 --> 10:47.313
so I've been researching
alternative methods

10:47.355 --> 10:50.983
to reduce
the inflammation.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.152
Here.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.488
Turmeric,
medicated plasters,

10:55.529 --> 10:57.448
acupuncture,

10:57.490 --> 11:00.201
therapeutic
ultrasound,

11:00.242 --> 11:01.619
cryotherapy.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.788
What do you think
I should try?

11:03.829 --> 11:08.876
Uh, turmeric,
maybe acupuncture.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.338
Well, what do you think
about, like, cortisone?

11:12.380 --> 11:15.341
I think that
it's risky.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.967
Well, Granny Mays
gets injections

11:17.009 --> 11:18.678
in her knee, like,
a couple times a year.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.180
It's pretty common.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.058
Yeah, but, baby, if
you use too much of it,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.601
it could
cause infection,

11:25.643 --> 11:28.020
degrade tissue,
even rupture a tendon.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.313
But if
it could help--

11:29.355 --> 11:32.566
No. No.
Those are shortcuts.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.777
You don't need them,

11:34.819 --> 11:38.239
and that's the boyfriend
and the athlete talking.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.700
Yeah.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.285
Well, how--
how's the recruit?

11:43.327 --> 11:45.996
Have you heard
from J.R.?

11:46.038 --> 11:50.167
Uh...no,
not a text.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.169
Well, if you're
trying to hide

11:52.211 --> 11:54.630
how much that bothers you,
you're failing.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.967
I don't know.
Something's up with J.R.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.136
I mean, he's been
mad competitive lately,

12:00.177 --> 12:02.638
and I don't get why he
didn't invite me over.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.598
Well, you should go
clear the air with J.R.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.226
and go get Jerry.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.145
And why
would I do that?

12:09.186 --> 12:11.814
Because you let
a 17-year-old

12:11.856 --> 12:13.274
high-school student
spend the night

12:13.315 --> 12:14.859
partying at a frat house,
how do you think

12:14.900 --> 12:17.903
Coach Marcus is gonna
feel about that?

12:17.945 --> 12:19.655

get over there.

of SGA came to me

transform the luncheon

you're avoiding me.

anything distract her

Y'all care
to explain this, huh?

you showed up.

going on with you two?

and fix this.

really messed up.

No, no, J.
You messed up.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.464
Were you ever
gonna tell me

20:15.505 --> 20:17.216
that KEK was
interested in me?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.550
No.

20:18.592 --> 20:22.137
Why? No, bro. Why?

20:22.179 --> 20:24.056
I thought that KEK
was all about legacy.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.474
You're my family.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.850
You don't want me
part of that legacy?

20:26.892 --> 20:27.267
Look, Damon.

20:27.309 --> 20:27.851
You're one
of those dudes

20:27.851 --> 20:28.477
who take up all
the oxygen in a room,

20:28.477 --> 20:30.854
and it's not even
something you mean to do.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.272
It just happens.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.774
OK, so what are you
trying to say, man?

20:33.815 --> 20:37.027
We share parents.
We share baseball.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.779
We share our
Bringston friends.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.073
Look. I just needed
something that was mine,

20:41.114 --> 20:42.658
and that something
was KEK until they

20:42.699 --> 20:44.117
decided the great
Damon Sims looked good

20:44.159 --> 20:46.119
repping
black and silver.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.589
Hold on, bro.
Where you going?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.549

what Coach said--

20:59.591 --> 21:01.343
find Jerry.

want to come with me?

really hard

21:18.902 --> 21:20.362
to put everything
together.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.738

confuse people

21:21.780 --> 21:23.156
to see me on campus,

21:23.198 --> 21:24.449
especially with
Keisha out of town.

with a man
were behind me.

not ready for me

her first.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.968
underestimating
your daughter.

talk about this later.

to apologize.

to leave this early.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.831

from Coach Marcus,

22:12.873 --> 22:15.584
but this school has been
through a lot lately.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.210

almost closed.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.920

a bomb threat,

22:18.962 --> 22:20.714
and clearly, there's
tension on the team, too.

and I want to find

22:23.008 --> 22:25.260
a place that really
feels like home.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.721
I don't think
BU's it.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.306

for me, after all.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.266

get in the way

the best of Bringston,

about attending an HBCU,

you can't leave
without really seeing

22:52.579 --> 22:55.082
what it's like
to be a part of us.

about to be blessed

a good word?

in my rearview.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.049
Already?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.634
Between catty
PKZ interests

23:47.676 --> 23:49.428
purposely
playing me

23:49.469 --> 23:50.971
and them mean girls
on the tennis court,

23:51.012 --> 23:52.472
clearly my
instincts are off

23:52.514 --> 23:54.057
when it comes
to finding sisterhood.

the tennis stuff

23:55.892 --> 23:57.602
is gonna
work itself out,

23:57.644 --> 24:00.313
and as for PKZ,
look,

24:00.355 --> 24:01.857
you sought them out
for a reason.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.191
Trust that.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.445
How? I don't
even trust me.

24:06.486 --> 24:09.156
By remembering
who you are. Look.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.074
You have this ability
to dig in people's hearts

24:11.116 --> 24:12.701
to make them better.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.327
Don't let drama
on the tennis team

24:14.369 --> 24:16.705
and a rough patch
with PKZ make you act

24:16.746 --> 24:18.874

that you're not.

to Assistant Coach Marcus Turner

24:48.612 --> 24:51.615
There's an elephant in the room
I'd like to address.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.367
Last semester, I stepped down
as head coach

24:54.409 --> 24:56.870
due to a mental-health issue.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.122
I was diagnosed
with Bipolar II Disorder

24:59.164 --> 25:01.333
after I left the minors,

25:01.374 --> 25:03.752
and when I was at my lowest,

25:03.793 --> 25:06.588
Bringston gave me
a second chance

25:06.630 --> 25:09.674
as well as access to resources
to stay balanced.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.635
Now, at Bringston,
we care about cultivating

25:11.676 --> 25:17.057
strong, young athletes
and well-rounded human beings.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.434
It's the body and mind
for us here--

Y'all did that. Ha ha ha!

25:48.255 --> 25:50.006
You know, this performance
was inspired

25:50.048 --> 25:52.676
by the HIV epidemic
of the Eighties and Nineties,

25:52.717 --> 25:56.471
and it serves as a good reminder
that in this day and age,

25:56.513 --> 26:01.101
HIV's not a death sentence,
so get tested, get treated.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.691
This was inspired by my Nico,

27:31.733 --> 27:34.361
so, babe, come celebrate
this moment with me.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.113
[Applause]

27:47.499 --> 27:48.875
Damon: So does this
help you forget

27:48.917 --> 27:50.543
all the fighting
with me and my brother?

27:50.585 --> 27:53.755
Wait. You and J.R.
are related?

27:53.797 --> 27:56.383
So what's the story?

27:58.134 --> 27:59.469
[Chuckles]

27:59.511 --> 28:01.429
Look.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.515
You seem like
a cool dude,

28:03.556 --> 28:05.433
but I don't really
share my business

28:05.475 --> 28:07.310
with strangers, man.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.813
OK. Then I guess I'm gonna
have to tell Coach Marcus

28:09.854 --> 28:11.815
I couldn't connect with
the Bringston players,

28:11.856 --> 28:14.526
so committing
to Hawkins.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.405
[Chuckles]

28:18.446 --> 28:20.615
Um...

28:20.657 --> 28:23.243
All right.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.328
J.R. and I,
we found out

28:25.370 --> 28:27.330
that we were brothers
a few months ago,

28:27.372 --> 28:29.999
and I thought we were
really tight, but...

28:32.127 --> 28:33.545
I guess not.

28:33.586 --> 28:37.340
Question--is J.R.
older than you?

28:37.382 --> 28:41.344
Yeah.
How'd you know?

28:41.386 --> 28:43.388
Man, I got an
older brother, too.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.931
You know, when
I was younger,

28:44.973 --> 28:46.474
I used to want
to follow him around.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.934
I wanted to do
everything he did.

28:47.976 --> 28:48.935
I idolized him.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.395
Hold up.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.647
I'm not following
J.R. around.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.524
Bro, it was obvious
he didn't want you

28:54.566 --> 28:56.484
at the KEK house,
and it was obvious

28:56.526 --> 28:58.528
you knew, and
you stayed anyway.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.363
I mean, yeah,
because

29:00.405 --> 29:02.073
frat brothers were
interested in me.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.533
He didn't tell me,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.368
said he wanted
to do his own thing.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.328
You know that's
totally normal, right?

29:07.370 --> 29:08.872
Y'all go to
the same college.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.124
You play
on the same team.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.002
It makes sense J.R.
needs his own space.

29:14.043 --> 29:17.172
I didn't even
want to join KEK,

29:17.213 --> 29:19.215
just messed me up
that J.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.009
didn't want me to be
a part of that, you know?

29:21.050 --> 29:23.553
That is classic
little-brother behavior

29:23.595 --> 29:25.138
right there.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.515
My money is going on you
two working things out.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.360
When I read
PKZ's creed...

29:40.779 --> 29:43.031
sisterhood
stands out the most.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.824
Where are you
going with this?

29:44.866 --> 29:47.744
PKZ should bring out
the best in women,

29:47.786 --> 29:49.537
not the worst.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.372
You've got interests
who are so anxious

29:51.414 --> 29:52.582
about joining
that one of them

29:52.624 --> 29:54.334
felt the need
to set me up.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.085
Aqueelah, that's
not sisterhood.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.546
I have no control over
who shows interest in PKZ.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.256
But you do have say
over the culture

30:00.298 --> 30:01.966
they find
when they do.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.802
You didn't give me
the event time

30:03.843 --> 30:05.470
as punishment,
and that right there

30:05.512 --> 30:07.680
is giving
mean-girl energy.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.600
Honestly, I was really
interested in PKZ.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.894
I thought it'd be
free of the drama,

30:12.936 --> 30:14.604
full of sisterhood,
and I don't know

30:14.646 --> 30:16.648
where you're from,
but where I grew up,

30:16.689 --> 30:20.026
sisterhood
includes grace.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.821
You're right...
kind of,

30:22.862 --> 30:24.823
but as part
of our process,

30:24.864 --> 30:26.616
we do have to
challenge you all

30:26.658 --> 30:28.284
to weed out the ones
who aren't interested

30:28.326 --> 30:30.286
for the right reasons.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.413
It's important
because once you cross,

30:32.455 --> 30:34.624
you're a sister
for life,

30:34.666 --> 30:36.501
but, like you said,

30:36.543 --> 30:38.920
there's always
room for grace.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.465
Hmm.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.133
What?

30:44.175 --> 30:45.760
Our founders
had the ability

30:45.802 --> 30:48.596
to read you for filth
but always with love.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.432
You just did that
effortlessly.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.726
[Chuckles]

30:53.768 --> 30:56.354
We need the best
of you, Simone.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.024
That's why I've been
pursuing you so hard.

31:00.066 --> 31:03.319
Don't give up
on us yet.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.543
I can't wait
to hear your excuse

31:18.585 --> 31:19.961
for abandoning me
in the middle

31:20.003 --> 31:21.421
of the most
important night

31:21.462 --> 31:22.672
of my
collegiate life.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.257
Nathaniel, please.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.175
You had plenty of people
there to support you.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.095
Nico, I'm constantly
supporting you,

31:29.137 --> 31:32.015
standing by your side as
the president's partner.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.892
I've dimmed my light
on more occasions

31:33.933 --> 31:36.060
than I can count
for you,

31:36.102 --> 31:38.438
and you couldn't let me
shine for one night?

31:38.479 --> 31:40.815
I never asked you
to do any of that.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.366
Nico, this
isn't gonna work.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.077
Oh, wait.
Are you--

31:54.120 --> 31:55.371
Are you
breaking up with me

31:55.413 --> 31:56.748
over a stupid event?

31:56.789 --> 31:58.166
No, no.
No, no, no, no. No.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.836
I'm breaking up
with you for me.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.923
I have been
through too much,

32:04.964 --> 32:08.509
fought too hard
to exist as me.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.721
I shine too bright,

32:11.763 --> 32:14.223
and damn if I'm
not proud of that.

32:17.435 --> 32:21.064
I will never dim
that light for anyone

32:21.105 --> 32:23.691
ever again.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.577
Come here, baby.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.287
How much of that
did you hear?

32:36.329 --> 32:38.665
Enough to know
I am so proud of you

32:38.706 --> 32:41.501
for speaking
your truth.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.504
Come here.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.593
Hey.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.098
Look.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.850
-The KEK thing, I get it.
-Hey, listen.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.061
I was acting
like a little punk.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.729
I do get it, J.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.439
KEK is your thing,

33:03.481 --> 33:05.274
and I'm not
gonna jump on it.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.693
I guess we're
getting a late start

33:06.734 --> 33:08.361
to this whole
sibling thing, huh?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.655
Yeah, but look.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.198
Next time,
it would help

33:12.240 --> 33:13.658
if you just, you know,
use your words.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.535
Oh, you're telling me
use my words.

33:15.576 --> 33:18.579
-Ha ha!
-Ha! Look at this.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.084
Man, how we gonna
convince this dude

33:23.126 --> 33:24.794
to be a Lion?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.838
I don't know, man.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.506
He's big on family,

33:28.548 --> 33:29.924
said that
he wanted a place

33:29.966 --> 33:31.926
that feels
like home.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.386
Hmm.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.513
I got an idea.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.807
Come on.

33:43.604 --> 33:47.316
Thea: Look.
You don't need Nico, OK?

33:47.358 --> 33:51.070
I know, but it
just still hurts.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.323
Simone: Don't run
from the pain.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.285
Someone very wise
once told me

33:57.326 --> 34:00.705
that you have to let
the tape play.

34:00.747 --> 34:05.001
Exactly.
Just feel all your feelings.

34:08.629 --> 34:10.339
Thank you for putting
the knives away

34:10.381 --> 34:13.176
long enough
to be here for me.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.970
If it's one thing Thea
and I can agree on,

34:16.012 --> 34:18.931
it's that
we got you.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.600
Got one more thing
to show you.

34:20.641 --> 34:21.976
What's that?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.770
-Our Bringston fam.
-Ha ha ha!

34:23.811 --> 34:25.605
Oh, you're good?

34:25.646 --> 34:28.357
No, but I'll get there.
Who's the cutie?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.109
This is our
recruit Jerry.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.819
Uh, yeah.

34:31.861 --> 34:34.572
This is Simone, Nate,
and my girlfriend Thea.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.114
Hey.

34:35.114 --> 34:35.531
We just wanted to
give him a taste

34:35.531 --> 34:35.990
of our
Bringston family,

34:35.990 --> 34:38.534
but clearly now
is not the time.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.244
Simone:
Actually, it is.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.788
Nate,
up on your feet.

34:41.829 --> 34:44.499
we're gonna
let the tape play

34:44.540 --> 34:46.000
with a little
bit of play.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.752
J.R.: All right.
I got dibs on foosball.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.171
OK. Kicking your butt
would make me feel better.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.006
Thea: Who wants to take me
in ping pong?

34:52.048 --> 34:53.966
Damon: I will as long as
you don't cheat this time.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.802
Jerry: Hey, you know
I got a great arm, right?

34:55.843 --> 34:58.096
I'm gonna go grab my tablet
to call Cam and Keisha.

how you came together

for your friend.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.289
That's how we do.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.249
It's family.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.834
Yeah. I guess
I was coming into BU

36:09.876 --> 36:11.711
with preconceived
notions.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.045
You know, the players
at Hawkins,

they didn't have
the best things

to say about you.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.013
I mean, the whole
rivals thing,

36:22.054 --> 36:23.639
I guess that explains
why Lando did

36:23.681 --> 36:25.474
what he did,
I guess.

36:25.516 --> 36:26.767
It says something
about Bringston

y'all could
put that aside

it wasn't cool

that he was secretly
recording your practices

36:36.777 --> 36:38.279
at Hawkins before
you transferred

yourself.

No, Coach. I'm just--

Yeah. I guess I am kind of
feeling the pressure.

37:09.685 --> 37:12.063
You got to take
your foot off the gas

37:12.104 --> 37:14.732
and give your body
some time.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.652
I think
it might be time

37:17.693 --> 37:19.695
to consider
redshirting.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.031

the whole season?

♪ Shine ♪

38:09.537 --> 38:11.163
Ahh.

38:11.205 --> 38:12.665
Marcus: Look, Jessie.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.708
I know you didn't want
me to talk about that.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.586
No. You did great.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.761
I told you not to
discuss those issues

38:25.803 --> 38:28.764
out of fear it would
scare recruits away.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.643
In reality, you
probably curried

38:32.685 --> 38:36.314
more favor than my
boring presentation.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.530
You make
a difference, Marcus.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.453
It's no surprise
why my sons love you.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.210
[Gulp]

38:58.252 --> 38:59.837
[Knocks on door]

39:01.297 --> 39:03.174
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.472
I'm sorry
about earlier.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.015
I've been thinking,

39:11.057 --> 39:13.934
and I don't know
why I'm so hesitant.

39:13.976 --> 39:16.979
I honestly think
Keisha would be thrilled.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.148
I know why.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.359
It has nothing
to do with Keisha

39:21.400 --> 39:24.695
and everything to do
with you not being ready.

39:24.737 --> 39:28.199
You're not done mourning
your wife yet, Zeke.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.784
No. Amara--

39:29.825 --> 39:33.412
I get it, and I don't
want to rush you.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.623
I'm flattered you
wanted to try with me,

39:35.664 --> 39:39.377
but I'm grown and
too bright a light

39:39.418 --> 39:42.296
to be
anybody's secret.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.132
Hmm.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.761
I understand.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.015
I'm not giving up
on us, though.

39:53.057 --> 39:58.312
One day, our timing
will be right.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.736
[Exhales]

40:05.778 --> 40:07.196
Hey.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.532
You rang?

40:09.573 --> 40:12.701
I am not sitting out
the season.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.662
I'm reclaiming
my spot on the team.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.417
I want the third
cortisone shot.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.133
[Ding]

40:28.050 --> 40:30.177
-Yo.
-Damon, what is going on?

40:30.219 --> 40:31.470
Are you OK?
You were blowing up--

40:31.512 --> 40:32.763
Lando, Lando.

40:32.805 --> 40:33.973
He's the one who
leaked the video

40:34.014 --> 40:35.766
of me practicing
at Hawkins.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.560
Seriously?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.438
He told you that?

40:40.479 --> 40:42.565
No. He didn't.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.900
Jerry heard it from
some Hawkins players

40:44.942 --> 40:46.485
when he went
on his visit.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.487
OK. Wait,
so this is a rumor.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.322
But it tracks.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.367
I've been saying he's not
a good dude from the jump.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.162
Damon, please
don't tell me

40:56.203 --> 40:57.663
that you're
telling me this

40:57.705 --> 40:59.123
because you think
that me and Lando--

40:59.165 --> 41:00.541
No, no. What? No.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.001
I'm trying to
look out for you,

41:02.042 --> 41:03.419
all right?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.504
He's not a good guy,

41:05.546 --> 41:07.590
and look.

41:07.631 --> 41:10.468
Whatever you two got
going on, I'm just--

41:10.509 --> 41:12.887
We don't even know
if this is for real,

41:12.928 --> 41:14.722
and I told you,
my love life

41:14.763 --> 41:16.932
is not up
for discussion.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.019
And why is that?

41:20.060 --> 41:22.646
You give me advice
on Thea all the time.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.399
Yeah, because you asked.
I'm not asking you.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.902
Oh, my God,
why are you being

41:27.943 --> 41:29.612
so hardheaded
right now?

41:29.653 --> 41:32.406
OK. I can't do this.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.575
Last semester, everything
with you and Jordan,

41:34.617 --> 41:36.535
I'm not gonna go
down that path again.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.287
Our personal lives
are off limits,

41:38.329 --> 41:40.080
and if you
can't respect that,

41:40.122 --> 41:42.249
then we need
some distance.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.533
Greg, move
your head.
