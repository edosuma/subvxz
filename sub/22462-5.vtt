00:02.000 --> 00:05.080
# I'm not sick, but I'm not well

00:05.120 --> 00:08.560
# And I'm so hot

00:08.600 --> 00:12.600
♪ Cos I'm in hell. ♪

00:13.160 --> 00:17.160
The programme contains strong
language throughout and adult humour.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.080
Education, education, education.
Ian coming over?

00:21.120 --> 00:25.120
Oh, yeah. Got some new Mandarin
flash cards. Take it up a level.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.040
I see you're sticking with
"the programme".

00:27.080 --> 00:29.000
Poor little bastard
doesn't even get a Jaffa Cake.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.120
I'm turning Ian into a super-toddler,

00:31.160 --> 00:33.560
the chocolate reward in sight
but always just out of reach.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.480
He is going to learn to defer
his gratification so damn hard.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.760
When are you finally going to get
your gratification, Mark?

00:39.800 --> 00:43.680
I don't know. Sort of all at once when
I finally dive into my pension pot.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.360
Ejaculate into a pile of M&S cashmere
jumpers and cruise brochures.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.680
Oi, Jez?

00:48.720 --> 00:51.800
I'd never masturbate into cashmere.
A nightmare to wash!

00:51.840 --> 00:55.200
Oh, hi, Sophie. Where's...?
I'm sorry, but don't start.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.800
Ian's with my mum.
Is it OK if we do it tomorrow?

00:56.840 --> 00:58.320
Meet us at the Kid Kave.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.400
But I've been preparing
all sorts of great IQ games.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.160
I've stuffed a pinata.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.200
It's filled with nature facts

01:05.239 --> 01:07.440
with the odd carob-covered raisin
to keep his morale up.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.000
Look, I'm sorry, Mark, I need to talk
to you. Have you got any beers in?

01:10.040 --> 01:11.680
This isn't America, Sophie.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.760
I don't keep random beers in.
I might have some rum,

01:14.800 --> 01:16.080
but you probably... Fine, rum.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.640
'She's a bit rum keen.'

01:17.680 --> 01:19.280
So, er...

01:19.320 --> 01:21.640
what's happened?
What happened with Ian?

01:21.680 --> 01:24.000
Oh, it's fucking Duncan. Obviously,
you're going to feel jealous.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.240
He's around the whole time.
I know how you feel about Duncan.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.600
'I love Duncan!

01:27.640 --> 01:29.880
'Sexless, unthreatening Duncan,

01:29.920 --> 01:31.320
'teaching him maths

01:31.360 --> 01:33.080
'and tag-teaming the Mandarin
flash cards.'

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
Duncan's a great guy,

01:34.160 --> 01:36.560
but he's a shit. Oh.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.320
OK, because since Duncan's
been around... Ugh!

01:39.360 --> 01:40.640
..Ian's scores have been
through the roof.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.400
"Scores"? Have you been
testing our son? No!

01:43.440 --> 01:44.440
I mean, yes.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.720
Just a bit of basic intelligence
testing.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.560
I do it to me and Jez, too,
just to keep track.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.560
Yeah, well, Duncan,
you know how he tutors?

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
Of course!

01:52.640 --> 01:54.960
When I saw how Ian
could hold a pen, I nearly shat.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.080
Well, I think he's getting a bit
fucking cosy with one of the mums.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.040
Alison. You remember Alison?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.040
"Oh, look at my floaty dress,
Sophie. Is it too much for the pub?"

02:03.080 --> 02:04.320
Oh. Right.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.080
What do I do? I'm pretty sure
he's having an affair.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.280
Well, I-I think you
shouldn't be too hasty.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.160
Maybe everything will run its course
with Duncan and Alison.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.240
You think I should wait
until he's bored of humping her?

02:15.280 --> 02:17.760
I just think Duncan
sounds like a real catch,

02:17.800 --> 02:19.680
and...people are...

02:19.720 --> 02:21.280
multifaceted.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.320
'Just let him get Ian started on
the viola and Ancient Greek.'

02:25.720 --> 02:28.200
Remember Grandma's Boner,
mid-noughties,

02:28.240 --> 02:31.040
when we teamed up with Perpetual
Spinach, did a bit of turbo folk?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.280
All the Whores of Malta.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.040
Exactly. Well, Whores of Malta's
been picked up.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.240
It's on a skills video
for a Hertha Berlin defender.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.440
Oh, wow!

02:40.480 --> 02:44.480
Yeah. Plus, I've got a cheque here
for you for 250 quid.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.360
Oh, my God!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.520
Mark!

02:47.560 --> 02:48.800
I've done a thing!

02:48.840 --> 02:50.760
Do you think when I do a search
this will come up?

02:50.800 --> 02:54.800
Cos when Joe searched, nothing
really came up apart from some

02:54.920 --> 02:57.240
shit I wrote in a forum about how

02:57.280 --> 02:59.280
Moby was overrated
and should be killed

02:59.320 --> 03:01.160
and his DNA expunged from humanity.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.640
Hm... And, you know,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.000
cold light of day,
it looks a bit much.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.960
Yeah, no, no, no, this should
come up now on the internet.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.520
"Lyrics by Super Hans."

03:10.560 --> 03:13.480
Yeah, you did the lyrics solo,
did you?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.040
Er, yeah.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.480
'Definitely, definitely didn't.'

03:16.520 --> 03:18.800
Yeah... Pretty sure I...helped.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.880
No, don't think so.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.280
Anyway, it's cool, yeah?

03:22.320 --> 03:23.520
Oh, yeah, it's cool.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.400
But I just think, would it be cool

03:25.440 --> 03:28.680
to change the credit to a shared
credit, though, do you think?

03:28.720 --> 03:31.640
Sure. Sure, I'll speak to the guy.
It'll be cool.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.160
Although there's a small chance
it might not be possible.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.240
Cool. Understood.
But you'll have a word.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.040
Absolutely.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.880
But the headlines are,
we did a track, everybody loves it.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.440
The rest is just bean counting
for the bread-heads, yeah?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.840
Yeah, truth to power, my friend.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.240
'I need to get away
and count my beans.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.640
'I think he's trying to take
some of my bloody beans!'

03:51.680 --> 03:55.680
Do... Do you want some bread
to go with that, as ballast?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.400
You're my ballast, Mark.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.080
Well, thank you...

04:00.120 --> 04:01.800
You weigh me down.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.800
You stop me from flying off.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.000
You're my ballast, Mark!

04:05.040 --> 04:06.040
Happy to be of service.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.560
'Stop calling me your ballast!'

04:07.600 --> 04:08.960
Hey!

04:09.000 --> 04:11.440
This may sound like a crazy idea,

04:11.480 --> 04:14.040
but why don't you move into
Nana's cottage with us, Mark?

04:14.080 --> 04:16.079
I'm-I'm sorry, how do you mean?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.720
With me and Ian.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.480
Fuck Duncan! He can drive around

04:19.519 --> 04:22.840
in Alison's Mazda like
a little pimp.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.840
You move in with us,
to Nana's cottage.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.520
We could be a fucked-up family!

04:26.560 --> 04:28.160
You're my ballast, Mark!

04:28.200 --> 04:29.800
'Let's see how she likes it.'

04:29.840 --> 04:31.440
You're my ballast, too, Sophie.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.920
'I think I'll be saying no to
a lifetime of

04:33.960 --> 04:36.200
'passive-aggressive
mutual ballast-calling.'

04:38.400 --> 04:40.040
April!

04:40.080 --> 04:42.760
I'm really sorry for turning up
like this, but I've been walking

04:42.800 --> 04:45.120
round the block,
and I just wanted to talk.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.600
'Talk? Yeah? Very quietly
at the door?'

04:48.920 --> 04:50.320
'Do come in and meet
my ex-wife, the drunk...'

04:50.360 --> 04:53.280
Um, sorry, just... I just want to
put everything on the table.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.240
'Get this shit off the table!'

04:55.280 --> 04:56.960
I know we've had a nice time
together,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.400
there's obviously
this mutual attraction...

04:59.440 --> 05:01.960
'Are we having sex on the table?'

05:02.000 --> 05:04.360
But the kiss, that was wrong.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.080
'Not wrong, right!'

05:06.120 --> 05:09.400
We crossed a line, and I don't think
we should see each other any more.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.920
Look, can we talk tomorrow?

05:11.960 --> 05:14.920
I'm taking my son to a play centre,
the Kid Kave.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.200
You could bring your niece.
It might be fun.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.280
I'm sorry, Mark, I...

05:19.320 --> 05:22.000
Goodbye might be simpler.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.320
'Oh, knife in the guts!'

05:23.360 --> 05:25.440
Goodbye, April.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.920
Let the dream crumble.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.440
'Lovely, crumbly dream
that I can't even eat with custard.'

05:30.480 --> 05:31.760
Who was that?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.760
Someone from the past.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.440
Ah, you love people from the past,

05:35.480 --> 05:37.080
don't you, Mark? Like Napoleon.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.720
Yes...

05:38.760 --> 05:42.760
But it wasn't Napoleon.
Ah, that's a shame.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.560
'Butter the toast.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
'Eat the toast.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.840
'Shit the toast.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.360
'God, life's relentless.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.520
'The April door closes,
the Sophie door opens.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.840
'The loveless marriage.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.560
'Cut off the cock and stick it
in a jar.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.720
'Might be a relief.'
I slept on it,

05:58.760 --> 06:00.280
but actually, I couldn't sleep

06:00.320 --> 06:03.040
because I became filled
with this boiling feeling of rage

06:03.080 --> 06:04.600
and now I've actually decided

06:04.640 --> 06:07.360
it's the worst thing
that ever happened. Jez...

06:07.400 --> 06:09.480
Joe's beginning to realise
that I'm a loser.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.480
It's very important that he doesn't
realise that I'm a loser.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.800
Because I'm not a loser.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.560
And would an aggressive campaign
to claim shared credit

06:16.600 --> 06:20.040
for the lyrics on a little bit of
song on an internet football video

06:20.080 --> 06:22.800
make you look like a winner,
would you say? Yes!

06:22.840 --> 06:25.480
I-I really think you need
to let this go.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.920
Take the advice of a man
who's been scientifically proven

06:27.960 --> 06:30.880
to have above-average intelligence.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.480
Oh, not the IQ test.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.880
I wasn't concentrating.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.680
'So what if I had a bit of help?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.720
'It's only the dunderheads
with their low IQs

06:39.760 --> 06:41.920
'who don't figure out the way to win

06:41.960 --> 06:43.760
'is looking stuff up
on the internet.'

06:43.800 --> 06:46.480
I don't need to take a stupid
IQ test to know that

06:46.520 --> 06:48.680
I'm three times as intelligent
as you. Oh, really?

06:48.720 --> 06:51.640
And what's three times 133?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.640
'Three 100s and 30 and 30 and 30.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.280
'But then all the threes...

06:56.320 --> 06:57.480
'Is it a trick question?'

06:57.520 --> 06:59.320
Mark, no-one does maths these days.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.160
We've all got calculators
in our pockets,

07:01.200 --> 07:03.360
just like all our maths teachers
said we wouldn't.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.520
Anyway, this proves nothing.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.280
Probably most people
are below average.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.640
Oh, fuck!

07:11.680 --> 07:13.280
Hans says it can't be changed.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
Apparently, the net
has run out of web space

07:15.360 --> 07:17.280
and they don't have enough bytes
left to add my name.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.280
Do you think he might be
taking advantage of you

07:19.320 --> 07:23.160
because you're mentally subnormal
and have a brain the size of a pea?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.040
This track is my Citizen Kane.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.120
The lyrics you want to
claim credit for,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.080
that's the electronic voice saying,

07:29.120 --> 07:31.240
"ATOL protected, ATOL protected"?

07:31.280 --> 07:32.640
Yes! Those are my words.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.760
'Inspired...'

07:33.800 --> 07:34.920
I remember because I was reading

07:34.960 --> 07:37.000
the small print on a plane ticket
when I came up with them.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.840
Copied them.
Discovered them.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.240
Hang on!

07:40.280 --> 07:41.560
It was your plane ticket.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.440
You went into a rant
about the Civil Aviation Authority

07:44.480 --> 07:46.960
and how ATOL protection
wasn't something to make light of.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.600
That sounds very believable. Yes!

07:48.640 --> 07:52.520
You've cracked the case.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.760
You're not thinking of
getting back with Sophie?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.000
A bit of a depressing backward step?

07:56.040 --> 07:58.400
Yeah, well, April's kaput.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.560
Maybe that's just life,

07:59.600 --> 08:02.200
your expectations
get ground down and down

08:02.240 --> 08:03.720
until finally you settle for a life

08:03.760 --> 08:05.600
that would have mortified you
20 years ago

08:05.640 --> 08:07.600
but now seems like a blessed relief.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.160
It's the journey of life, like

08:09.200 --> 08:11.840
Radio 1, Radio 2, Classic FM,

08:11.880 --> 08:13.680
Heart, Magic, dead.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.040
Mm. Yeah.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.680
OK. Are you ready?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.840
"My recollection, so far as it goes,
is that Jeremy did indeed

08:20.880 --> 08:23.320
"make a significant contribution
to the lyrics in question,

08:23.360 --> 08:26.640
"ie the words 'ATOL protected'."

08:26.680 --> 08:28.560
Hi, Hans. I've brought you
a panettone.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.680
Sweet. What is it?

08:30.720 --> 08:31.840
I don't know. You see them around.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.080
Sort of like
dry, old Italian cake.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.520
Right. Wicked.
Yeah, and also,

08:37.559 --> 08:40.000
Mark had something to say.
Erm...

08:40.039 --> 08:42.200
my recollection, so far as it goes,

08:42.240 --> 08:44.680
is that Jeremy...
Look, Jez, you were there. Fine.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.720
You were part of a creative milieu.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.320
You contributed to engendering
a vibe,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.680
out of which emerged my lyric.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.760
I wrote it.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.120
I know I wrote those lyrics,
cos I keep 'em

08:55.160 --> 08:57.120
in my lyrics file.
You can't remember jack shit,

08:57.160 --> 08:58.520
because you're a crackhead

08:58.560 --> 09:00.280
with a brain made of Swiss cheese.
No, mate.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.400
I'm straight-edge now.
I walk the line.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.720
Molly won't even let me
live-stream the Spurs.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.240
We're going to come for you
in the night.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.400
He might, but I definitely won't.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.960
Look, calm down, will ya?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Sit in the bath and have a Magnum.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.520
Wanker!

09:14.560 --> 09:15.800
'Yeah, fuck off, Hans.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.920
'You're the fifth Beatle.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.600
'I'm the other four.'

09:18.640 --> 09:20.360
Come on, Jez, let's go.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.760
I've got to get to the Kid Kave.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.400
Hans's file! The proof!

09:23.440 --> 09:25.080
It's in there. And because I've got

09:25.120 --> 09:26.200
a genius IQ...

09:26.240 --> 09:28.680
'Below-average IQ.'

09:28.720 --> 09:31.120
..I've cracked the code of
the spare key.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.280
It's like cracking Enigma, isn't it,

09:33.320 --> 09:34.960
looking under
all the different flowerpots?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.320
Oh, Christ, Jez, not burgling!

09:37.360 --> 09:39.080
OK, I'm here to borrow a brolly.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.760
If anyone comes, I'm saying
I popped in to borrow a brolly.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.360
Here we go.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.480
Apple grievances, Lemmy...lyrics.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.240
Nothing?! Nothing at all?!

09:49.280 --> 09:50.960
Right, fuck him.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.600
Revenge. Revenge is
the sexy man's justice.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.000
Ohh...
Ooh!

09:57.040 --> 09:58.720
Someone who is expecting cornflakes

09:58.760 --> 10:01.800
is going to get a big fucking
multi-hit of Shreddies.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.800
Boom!
That is inconvenient!

10:03.840 --> 10:05.520
OK, I'm going to lick these apples

10:05.560 --> 10:07.560
and put his bank card
in the freezer.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.400
You start swapping the CDs
into the wrong cases.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.640
OK, I'm going.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
Wait!

10:12.720 --> 10:14.840
Watch this.
'Oh, Jesus. I'm a backup burglar.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.800
'I'm a burglar's PA.'

10:16.840 --> 10:18.400
No, Jeremy, really?

10:18.440 --> 10:20.480
Goldfish in the Shreddies?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.680
Is that your budget version
of a horse's head in the bed?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.480
It's the free gift that's going to
send him clinically insane.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.920
Well, for God's sake
leave the snake alone.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.080
Here, fishy.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.000
'And the IQ testing is complete.'

10:37.060 --> 10:38.740
If I could go back in time,

10:38.780 --> 10:41.500
maybe I wouldn't have split up
with Sophie in the first place.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.559
Where would you go, though, if you
could actually go back, in time?

10:44.639 --> 10:48.660
So many choices. Periclean Athens,
Egypt under Rameses I,

10:48.700 --> 10:50.740
the Ziggurat of Ur... God!

10:50.780 --> 10:52.660
I think I'd probably go back to
the '50s.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.180
The 1950s? Jeremy, I'm talking about

10:55.220 --> 10:58.220
seeing a civilisation
that's unimaginably different.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.100
So am I. Thick, thick shakes,

11:00.140 --> 11:03.940
real fat burgers,
big Chevvies, cheerleaders.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.700
But Socrates? If you went for 14AD,

11:05.740 --> 11:08.340
you could nab Augustus and Jesus.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.460
Nyah.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.700
"Nyah"?

11:10.740 --> 11:11.980
If not the '50s, then the '60s.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.220
See the Rolling Stones and have
a Coke. Jeremy,

11:14.260 --> 11:16.260
you can literally still do
exactly that.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.660
I'm talking about seeing them in their
prime, drinking Coke out of a bottle.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.660
'Enjoy Cokeless Rome, dickhead!'

11:21.700 --> 11:22.700
Jesus.

11:22.740 --> 11:25.980
This is where we bring them now,
the poor fuckers?

11:26.020 --> 11:28.100
I mean, God, net them up,

11:28.140 --> 11:29.140
bag 'em and tag 'em.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.300
Oh, it looks fun! You can have
a cappuccino while they play.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.940
All I can think about is death.

11:33.980 --> 11:35.442
Better than the fucking park, mate.

11:35.522 --> 11:37.820
You really want to kill yourself
at the park, all right?

11:37.860 --> 11:41.180
So, Sophie - are you going to pull
on the iron underpants,

11:41.220 --> 11:44.700
tie your knob to the Bosch and just run
yourself over with the Morphy Richards?

11:44.740 --> 11:46.100
It's a real three-piper.

11:46.140 --> 11:49.180
If I say yes, I'll regret it,
that's certain.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.900
Claustrophobic, depressing,

11:50.940 --> 11:52.820
mouldering resentment.
Corrigan classic.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.980
But if I say no,
I'll also definitely regret it,

11:56.020 --> 11:59.140
overwhelming feelings
of regret, guilt and sadness.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.860
The old familiar.
Mark?

12:00.900 --> 12:02.020
Wow, my son.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.340
Hi, Ian!

12:03.380 --> 12:04.780
Ian-Ian-Ian-Ian!

12:04.820 --> 12:06.820
How are you doing, little fella?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.100
'Flicker of recognition?
Basically uninterested.'

12:09.140 --> 12:11.700
Hey there, little guy! High-five!
'Ugh, the high-five.

12:11.740 --> 12:15.740
'Like the grey squirrel, it will drive
the handshake to extinction eventually.'

12:15.860 --> 12:18.700
Come on, little fella, let Uncle
Jeremy put you in the rage cage.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.780
So, what are you thinking, cowboy?
The big offer? Happy families?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.820
Ian. It's all about Ian.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.780
You know what? Let's do it.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.100
Wow, just like that?
Screw it, let's give it a go.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.940
I think it could work, maybe,
in some weird way?

12:30.980 --> 12:32.940
I think maybe it might.
Do you think we'll be unhappy?

12:32.980 --> 12:35.860
Very.
Put it there, partner.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.420
'What this phlegm has put together,
let no man break asunder.'

12:39.460 --> 12:41.020
Erm, look, Mark, I've got to go.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.420
Duncan wants to have a drink,
the total shit.

12:43.460 --> 12:46.860
And I need to phone Dad, tell him
about you. He's going to piss blood!

12:46.900 --> 12:48.660
Ha... Er, OK...

12:48.700 --> 12:51.940
Want to cry and be sick at the
same time, do you? No! I-I'm excited.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.260
It's... It's exciting.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.100
'The first of the million lies

12:55.140 --> 12:58.060
'that are going to make up
our terrible relationship.'

12:58.100 --> 12:59.180
See you later!

12:59.220 --> 13:01.100
Ian's in the fun pit working
the plastics.

13:01.140 --> 13:02.500
What have I done? What have I done?

13:02.540 --> 13:04.620
He's being detained
at capitalism's pleasure.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.220
I said yes. OK...

13:07.260 --> 13:11.260
You, my friend, are a stone-cold
maniac.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.660
Leftovers? I'm broke. Can't you
just bank the YouTube money?

13:15.700 --> 13:18.900
It could weaken my claim.
The claim must not be weakened.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.460
What the fuck is that?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.580
W-What's in there?

13:21.620 --> 13:23.860
In where? I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.780
Your bag just moved! What have you...

13:25.820 --> 13:28.380
OK, I needed a little...margin,

13:28.420 --> 13:31.140
collateral, to stop Super Hans
in his tracks.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.260
His...

13:32.300 --> 13:33.300
snake.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.420
You brought a snake
to a children's play centre?

13:36.460 --> 13:38.740
Oh, Mark, don't make this into
a thing.

13:38.780 --> 13:39.820
Is it venomous?

13:39.860 --> 13:42.300
Probably not.
I picked it up with an oven glove,

13:42.340 --> 13:44.300
but it didn't look venomous.

13:44.340 --> 13:46.020
It didn't "look" venomous?

13:46.060 --> 13:48.380
It looked perfectly chilled out
when I put it in the bag.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.163
And what about now
that it's been confined

13:50.243 --> 13:51.540
to the bag for a couple of hours?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.220
It's fine. It's double-bagged.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.540
I'm going to call Super Hans,
get him to come over here

13:55.580 --> 13:57.500
and we'll settle this thing
once and for all.

13:57.540 --> 14:01.540
This children's play centre is
your designated snake handover arena?

14:01.860 --> 14:04.460
He can't come at me in the kid farm,
can he? It's perfect.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.060
Hi, Mark.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.620
Jeremy...

14:07.660 --> 14:09.100
April! What are you doing here?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.460
Sorry, I know I said...

14:10.500 --> 14:12.020
But I've had more time to think.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.020
You did invite me.
'She came!'

14:14.060 --> 14:15.780
This is my niece, Hayley.

14:15.820 --> 14:16.860
Hi!

14:16.900 --> 14:19.380
Er, hello, Hayley, erm...
Take a seat!

14:19.420 --> 14:23.220
I'll throw her in, if you like.
Into the wipe-clean penitentiary.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.820
'She actually came!'

14:27.340 --> 14:29.500
Hans, it's Jez.
Come and meet me at the Kid Kave.

14:29.540 --> 14:32.140
Just get to Thornton Heath
and follow the screaming.

14:32.180 --> 14:34.500
I wanted to have a big talk
with Angus last night.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.500
He was OK, but he was writing to
the Pope.

14:36.540 --> 14:39.260
He sometimes thinks he might be able
to heal the Great Schism.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.780
'Cuckoo!'
Intellectually, he's scintillating,

14:41.820 --> 14:44.700
but he'd never take coke
and throw an iPad out the window.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.980
Yes, well, that's just how I roll.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.220
'Finally, I'm the Ferrari,

14:48.260 --> 14:50.860
'he's the fucking Volvo.'
Mark?

14:50.900 --> 14:54.900
Would you like to do
something rather naughty?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.940
'Oh, April!'

14:57.980 --> 14:59.500
This is quite naughty.

14:59.540 --> 15:02.140
Naughty naughty!
Blimey!

15:02.180 --> 15:05.140
'"Disabled toilet baby changing
shelf,"

15:05.180 --> 15:08.300
'the five sexiest words
in the English language.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.380
'I hope my son's OK with Jeremy

15:10.420 --> 15:11.700
'and the snake.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.260
'No, be in the moment!'

15:13.300 --> 15:15.340
Erm, I don't want to break the spell,

15:15.380 --> 15:19.220
but should I make haste to purchase
some condoms, perchance?

15:19.260 --> 15:20.540
Oh, it's fine, it'll be OK.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.660
'I wonder what kind of OK.
"No baby" OK,

15:23.700 --> 15:26.340
'or, "OK, we're having a baby".

15:26.380 --> 15:30.380
'Quite interested, but a bit rude
to ask.'

15:30.620 --> 15:32.380
Well, that was fun.
That was fun!

15:32.420 --> 15:34.100
And does it mean...

15:34.140 --> 15:35.620
I think it means something.

15:35.660 --> 15:36.900
'Lovely something!

15:36.940 --> 15:38.500
'Oh, he's gone totally mental.'

15:38.540 --> 15:41.740
He's saving money to spend
on a never-ending court battle.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.020
Jarndyce versus Jarndyce?

15:43.060 --> 15:44.140
Exactly.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.180
'Ah, April, you are the one.'

15:46.220 --> 15:48.180
I was looking for you.
Hayley's throwing a wobbly.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.540
Oh, shit. I'll, erm, take her
outside for some fresh air.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.900
Hayley?
Where the hell were you?

15:52.940 --> 15:55.260
Well, I...
Come on, let's go outside.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.140
We...

15:57.180 --> 15:58.820
We just did it in the disabled loo!

15:58.860 --> 16:01.060
Mark! You are on fire today!

16:01.100 --> 16:02.900
Shall I alert all the other women
in here

16:02.940 --> 16:06.260
in case you try and hump them
or move in with them?

16:06.300 --> 16:07.900
So, what are you thinking with
Sophie?

16:07.940 --> 16:10.340
April. It's got to be April.
Exactly.

16:10.380 --> 16:14.380
Me and Sophie and Ian,
it was a crazy scheme.

16:14.420 --> 16:18.260
It would probably do him so much
harm, living between warring parents.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.380
That's the line.

16:19.420 --> 16:22.540
Yeah, do what you want, mate,
shovel the kid into the kid pit.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.500
Better call Sophie, see if she minds

16:24.540 --> 16:27.340
picking up Ian later from the flat.
Where is Ian?

16:27.380 --> 16:28.460
Dunno.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.220
I thought you were keeping an eye
on him!

16:30.260 --> 16:32.037
I'm not a professional
childminder, Mark.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.020
Anyway, I probably don't
have a high enough IQ.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.180
The least you could do
was keep an eye on Ian while I...

16:36.220 --> 16:38.260
Hump someone else's wife
in the disabled toilet?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.540
I'm not a member of your entourage,
Mark.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.020
Ian! Ian!

16:43.060 --> 16:46.380
Ooh, Mark, mate,
something wonky this way comes.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.700
Good luck.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.700
'Oh, fuck! She's not here. We never
talked. The deal never happened.'

16:51.740 --> 16:54.660
H-Have you been...?
Have you had a drink?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.740
Why, am I not allowed to?
Mark's booze patrol?

16:56.780 --> 16:58.540
'She just loves wine.'

16:58.580 --> 17:00.260
I had a ding-dong with Duncan.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.180
And he's off to Alison
with her little fuck-me Mazda.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.099
Oh...
But I don't have

17:05.140 --> 17:08.220
a fucking Mazda.
Sorry, I've got a fucking Micra.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.579
I've made my decision.

17:09.619 --> 17:12.404
Dad might think it's mental.
Everyone might think it's mental.

17:12.483 --> 17:13.500
'It's definitely mental.'

17:13.540 --> 17:15.700
Look, why don't I call you a cab
and you can go home

17:15.740 --> 17:18.900
and then we can have a big chat
about everything later, yeah?

17:18.940 --> 17:20.740
Ah, cool your heels, let's have
a coffee.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.420
No, Soph, I need to find Ian!

17:22.460 --> 17:24.300
I should never have left him with
Jez.

17:24.339 --> 17:26.180
Ian? Ian!

17:26.220 --> 17:27.700
Oh, for God's sake, relax.

17:27.740 --> 17:31.140
It's not like he's on the M25.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.420
Ian?

17:32.460 --> 17:33.580
'Oh, this is murder

17:33.620 --> 17:35.300
'on my back.'
You know what?

17:35.340 --> 17:37.780
Duncan's a prick. Fuck him.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.860
The naughty lady likes funny words,
cos she's feeling funny.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.420
Have you seen a little boy?

17:45.460 --> 17:46.740
Mark, you're freaking him out.

17:46.780 --> 17:47.900
He's not answering.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.780
Why aren't you answering?
What have you done with him?!

17:49.820 --> 17:51.700
Ian!
I like you, Mark.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.740
But I don't love you.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.580
I hate you.
Noted.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.420
Oh, this is a disaster.

17:57.460 --> 17:59.180
What if he's hurt himself?
No!

17:59.220 --> 18:00.460
You show me a sharp corner.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.380
What if he's wandered out
through an emergency exit?

18:03.420 --> 18:04.580
No, they'll lock them all.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.740
They lock the emergency exits?!
What if there's a fire?!

18:06.780 --> 18:08.100
Oh, Christ!

18:09.380 --> 18:13.380
I'm going to have a little lie down,
Mark. I'm tired.

18:14.140 --> 18:17.380
OK, you have a lie down
in the ball pit. I'll find Ian

18:17.420 --> 18:20.260
and then we'll have a big chat
about everything.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.340
'A big chat during which

18:21.380 --> 18:23.460
'I will reverse out of our agreement

18:23.500 --> 18:25.780
'as elegantly as a man backing
his car

18:25.820 --> 18:29.820
'into the entire peloton
of the Tour de France.'

18:30.140 --> 18:32.700
So, look, I spoke to Molly. Y'know?

18:32.740 --> 18:34.540
She thinks you're a dong.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.980
Slippery, like a...

18:36.020 --> 18:37.260
real sketchy fucker.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.300
Well, I think she's a small-minded,
two-faced buzz-killing machine.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.740
But...

18:41.780 --> 18:44.900
she said I needed to man up,
have the credit changed.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.660
She's decent, though. She is.
I've always said that.

18:47.700 --> 18:50.860
So I made the call.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.140
Oh, wow!

18:54.180 --> 18:56.340
Thanks, man, you put me on!

18:56.380 --> 18:59.420
Amazing. They found
some more web space, then? Yeah.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.540
Yeah, they must have, er,
deleted some old photos, an' that.

19:02.580 --> 19:06.220
And, erm, have you been back
to your flat since we spoke?

19:06.260 --> 19:07.540
Just out of interest.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.740
No. Why?

19:08.780 --> 19:10.180
I kind of broke in, looking

19:10.220 --> 19:11.940
for evidence, and...

19:11.980 --> 19:13.700
I sort of...

19:13.740 --> 19:15.060
killed your fish.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.580
You killed Flop? Jesus Christ!

19:17.620 --> 19:18.900
Yeah.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.820
Flop was one of the good guys, man!
He was old-school.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.300
I know. I'm sorry. I always liked
Flop.

19:24.340 --> 19:27.660
And there's one other thing I did
that I shouldn't have.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.820
Not Flip as well?
No. No.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.340
I feel bad about this, but...

19:32.380 --> 19:33.460
I took...

19:33.500 --> 19:35.660
'Oh, fuck.'

19:35.700 --> 19:38.340
What?
I took...

19:38.380 --> 19:39.380
this.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.100
Er... It's fine.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.220
Well, no.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.260
They cost money, and the bottom line
is... 'Where's the fucking snake?'

19:45.300 --> 19:47.700
..it's your bag, and I stole it.

19:47.740 --> 19:48.780
And I feel...

19:48.820 --> 19:49.940
'Where the fuck is he?'

19:49.980 --> 19:52.460
..incredibly ashamed of that.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.140
Oh. Er...

19:55.180 --> 19:59.180
no worries, dude.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.620
'Oh, I've lost my child.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.980
'I'm such a terrible, terrible human
in every single respect.'

20:05.020 --> 20:06.540
Hans just caved. We won.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.580
Oh, good.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.260
Only downside is...the snake
escaped. What?!

20:10.300 --> 20:12.940
I can't believe it would do that.
So...sneaky!

20:12.980 --> 20:14.420
Yeah. Who could believe

20:14.460 --> 20:16.500
a snake would be so duplicitous?

20:16.540 --> 20:18.660
They're so famously reliable, snakes.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.540
The good news is, I googled it
and it's totally not venomous.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.780
'So reassuring...'

20:22.820 --> 20:24.460
What are you doing?
It's Ian.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.740
I can't find him anywhere.

20:25.780 --> 20:27.900
So many bloody kids.

20:27.940 --> 20:31.340
I need to somehow get them all
cleared out, maybe shout "Fire" or...

20:31.380 --> 20:33.940
I could tell the staff that
you were a famous paedo.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.660
That would clear the place,
like Jaws at the beach.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.940
"A famous paedo"?
What?

20:37.980 --> 20:40.780
You're very free and easy about
labels.

20:40.820 --> 20:42.780
You don't mind a bit of a bad-boy
rep.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.020
I'll need to talk to Sophie.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.700
I think she might be balls deep.

20:47.740 --> 20:51.220
Soph?

20:51.260 --> 20:52.980
She's out cold.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.540
Oh, God, April! She can't see

20:55.580 --> 20:58.940
my sort of wife who I've sort of
agreed to get back together with

20:58.980 --> 21:01.740
and is sort of a total fucking mess.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.740
I mean, you could...
Bury the body?

21:03.780 --> 21:05.660
I was going to say wake her up
and get her a coffee.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.500
But Shallow Ball Grave?

21:07.540 --> 21:10.500
She's pretty much already buried.

21:10.540 --> 21:11.860
Well, don't fuck about.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.620
If you're going to bury her, bury
her.

21:14.660 --> 21:15.860
This is fine.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.940
It's just a nice, multicoloured
siesta.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.700
OK. Good.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.420
This is good. Bury Sophie,

21:21.460 --> 21:23.460
find Ian, leave with April.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.100
Do you think she'll be able
to breathe in her grave?

21:26.140 --> 21:28.460
Of course! The air holes are
numerous.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.020
OK. Just push her head down.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.420
It's poking up a bit.
Just need to weigh her down more.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.780
There we go.

21:34.820 --> 21:38.180
She's gone. She's gone, Mark.
You're cool.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.420
Hey, Mark, there's Ian.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.860
Great!

21:40.900 --> 21:43.820
Although, do you think
he witnessed the burial?

21:43.860 --> 21:45.220
Er...

21:45.260 --> 21:47.820
'He looks OK. That's right, son,
push it all down.

21:47.860 --> 21:50.340
'My pension can go on therapy.'

21:50.380 --> 21:51.380
Hey there, little buddy!

21:51.420 --> 21:52.980
Hey, Mark.
Hi!

21:53.020 --> 21:54.620
Hayley was fine, but she was

21:54.660 --> 21:56.740
babbling something about a snake.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.100
Oh, God! Well, let's get
the hell out of here.

21:59.140 --> 22:00.780
Back to mine for a wine?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.380
Yeah, OK, why not?

22:02.420 --> 22:04.100
Mark, erm, I just want to say,

22:04.140 --> 22:06.540
I'm really pleased I came to see
you. Really pleased.

22:06.580 --> 22:09.020
Me, too, April. Me, too.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.900
Mark?

22:10.940 --> 22:12.780
There's, erm... There's a...

22:12.820 --> 22:15.820
Wha'...?
Oh, God!

22:15.860 --> 22:17.260
That's fine...

22:17.300 --> 22:18.420
I-I imagine.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.700
Probably some funny buried clown.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.540
'Oh! I should have used more balls.'

22:23.580 --> 22:25.380
What the...?

22:25.420 --> 22:27.460
Mark! Why did you bury me?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
I didn't bury you.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.140
If you don't want to move in after
all, you don't have to bury me,

22:31.180 --> 22:33.420
just send a fucking text!

22:33.460 --> 22:35.580
Mark?
It's OK.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.060
Probably been in there for months.

22:37.100 --> 22:40.820
Just some kind of
homeless ball-pit witch.

22:44.380 --> 22:48.140
It doesn't feel quite right leaving
a snake in a child's soft-play area.

22:48.180 --> 22:51.660
'Burying your wife alive, it
just has such an unfortunate ring.'

22:51.700 --> 22:53.140
Maybe we should leave a note.

22:53.180 --> 22:56.140
Saying...?
"Sorry... Snake"?

22:56.180 --> 23:00.180
Hmm...
