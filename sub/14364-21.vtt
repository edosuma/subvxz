WEBVTT

00:09.647 --> 00:10.746
Hoo-yah!

00:10.748 --> 00:11.781
Oh!

00:11.783 --> 00:13.983
Munched!

00:13.985 --> 00:15.418
<i>Give it up</i>

00:15.420 --> 00:17.920
<i>for the baddest beast machines</i>
<i>on the planet!</i>

00:19.457 --> 00:22.124
Would you mind
lowering the volume?

00:22.126 --> 00:24.560
Hey, Ratch, check out
the monster-truck rally

00:24.562 --> 00:25.995
Miko took me to last week.

00:25.997 --> 00:28.431
I compiled some highlights
with my cellphone.

00:28.433 --> 00:30.199
Innocent vehicles battling

00:30.201 --> 00:32.868
for the pleasure
of human spectators?

00:32.870 --> 00:34.637
Blood sport.

00:34.639 --> 00:35.971
Yeah! Yeah!

00:35.973 --> 00:39.141
You could be helping Optimus
in the field right now.

00:39.143 --> 00:40.843
Aw, he doesn't need
my help

00:40.845 --> 00:44.046
to search for some ancient
educational thingamabob.

00:44.048 --> 00:47.049
The "thingamabob"
to which you refer

00:47.051 --> 00:50.453
happens to be
a cybertronian data cylinder.

00:51.956 --> 00:53.422
Hey!

00:53.424 --> 00:55.124
And there is no telling

00:55.126 --> 00:57.760
what vast intelligence
it may hold.

00:57.762 --> 00:59.395
During the golden age,

00:59.397 --> 01:02.298
dozens of these cylinders
were created,

01:02.300 --> 01:04.632
each containing the sum total
of cybertronian knowledge

01:04.635 --> 01:05.634
on any given subject...

01:06.971 --> 01:10.005
Stellar cartography,
medicine, ancient mythology.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.373
When the war broke out,

01:11.375 --> 01:14.243
the cylinders were hidden
throughout the galaxies

01:14.245 --> 01:17.379
to keep them as far as possible
from Decepticon reach.

01:17.381 --> 01:20.683
Detecting one signal here,
on Earth,

01:20.685 --> 01:22.952
is the opportunity of a...

01:22.954 --> 01:24.520
T.M.I., dude.

01:24.522 --> 01:25.488
Switch it back!

01:25.490 --> 01:27.590
I want to see
the hoedown showdown!

01:28.559 --> 01:30.693
<i>Ratchet,</i>
<i>Decepticon ambush.</i>

01:30.695 --> 01:32.428
<i>The cylinder is at risk.</i>

01:32.430 --> 01:34.430
<i>We require backup.</i>

01:34.432 --> 01:37.600
Backup
is what I'm built for.

01:39.603 --> 01:42.471
Go bend some fenders,
Bulk.

01:46.343 --> 01:49.512
I have an important mission
for you, too, Miko.

01:49.514 --> 01:50.846
Really?

01:52.082 --> 01:54.617
Aw!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.537 --> 02:14.370
Ooh!

02:23.527 --> 02:27.027
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

03:07.413 --> 03:08.082
Ooh!

03:15.121 --> 03:16.388
Whoa.

03:20.494 --> 03:22.895
Autobots, stand your ground.

03:22.897 --> 03:26.799
The artifact must not
fall into enemy hands.

03:40.614 --> 03:42.681
Come to papa.

03:44.918 --> 03:46.752
Run to mommy.

03:48.355 --> 03:49.788
Say "Uncle."

03:49.790 --> 03:50.923
Say it!

03:59.767 --> 04:01.133
Ratchet, come in.

04:01.135 --> 04:02.101
Miko?

04:02.103 --> 04:03.536
This is
an emergency channel.

04:03.538 --> 04:06.906
We need to keep it open for
the auto...

04:06.908 --> 04:08.307
Wait.
Where are you?

04:08.309 --> 04:10.509
D'oy!
I'm with the thingamabob.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.312
Thingama...
The data cylinder!

04:13.314 --> 04:15.714
Yes. Can you bridge it
out of here?

04:15.716 --> 04:18.183
I'll reactivate
arrival coordinates.

04:19.553 --> 04:23.122
Dude, can you
open it any closer?

04:23.124 --> 04:25.157
Supply coordinates.

04:25.159 --> 04:26.825
Um...50 yards?

04:26.827 --> 04:29.094
<i>Precise</i> coordinates.

04:29.096 --> 04:30.696
Wha!

04:42.910 --> 04:44.510
1...2...

04:54.088 --> 04:55.854
Whoa.

04:59.459 --> 05:00.893
Miko?

05:03.029 --> 05:04.863
No!

05:12.640 --> 05:13.372
Bulk!

05:16.209 --> 05:19.578
You really took one
for the team, Bulkhead...

05:19.580 --> 05:21.780
<i>My</i> team.

05:28.688 --> 05:30.856
Bulkhead, are you...

05:30.858 --> 05:31.724
Fine.

05:31.726 --> 05:33.158
It didn't even smart.

05:35.261 --> 05:38.564
I helped lose that thing.
I want to help find it.

05:38.566 --> 05:41.634
I need to get back
in the field with Optimus.

05:41.636 --> 05:43.769
Eh, eh, you're under
my watch now.

05:43.771 --> 05:44.937
Optimus' orders.

05:44.939 --> 05:47.306
And running a full scan
of your neural net

05:47.308 --> 05:49.375
would be a wiser use
of your time.

05:49.377 --> 05:50.309
Come on, doc.

05:50.311 --> 05:52.978
There's nothing up there
to scan.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.980
He seems fine to me.

05:54.982 --> 06:00.386
Well, if you insist
on making yourself useful,

06:00.388 --> 06:03.322
you can help
Miko tidy up.

06:04.891 --> 06:06.959
Aw!
He's mad with power.

06:06.961 --> 06:09.161
That's Ratchet.

06:09.163 --> 06:11.363
No vector squared,
all right.

06:11.365 --> 06:13.098
What?!

06:13.100 --> 06:16.101
Hey, we got any paint
around here?

06:16.103 --> 06:18.704
Art project? Cool!

06:23.276 --> 06:25.711
What do you mean,
it's empty?

06:25.713 --> 06:26.845
Lord Megatron,

06:26.847 --> 06:29.782
these cylinders are not
unlike batteries.

06:29.784 --> 06:33.318
The data is stored within them
as a form of energy.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.087
It scanned fully charged...

06:35.089 --> 06:37.923
That's how we located it
to begin with...

06:37.925 --> 06:38.824
But now...

06:39.760 --> 06:41.226
Dead battery.

06:41.228 --> 06:43.562
Did you drop it,
you one-eyed oaf?!

06:43.564 --> 06:44.530
No, master.

06:44.532 --> 06:46.398
I wasn't gonna
touch the thing

06:46.400 --> 06:48.567
after it put the zap
on Bulkhead.

06:48.569 --> 06:51.470
Hey, you think...

06:51.472 --> 06:52.738
I know.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.742
And I must find out
what that vessel contained.

06:56.744 --> 07:01.480
When it comes to the secrets
of the ancients,

07:01.482 --> 07:03.916
knowledge can be power.

07:03.918 --> 07:05.150
Seriously, Ratch,

07:05.152 --> 07:07.486
you need to see
what Bulk's painting in here.

07:07.488 --> 07:10.456
Yes, I'm sure one
hasn't truly lived

07:10.458 --> 07:12.124
until one has beheld

07:12.126 --> 07:15.627
Bulkhead's take on still life
with lug nuts.

07:15.629 --> 07:18.263
See? Did I tell you
or what?

07:18.265 --> 07:22.334
The differential of one-third
"R" cubed is RDRR.

07:22.336 --> 07:24.770
That is not art.

07:24.772 --> 07:26.805
It's science.

07:29.746 --> 07:31.880
This hot spot
you see here...

07:31.882 --> 07:35.683
It's information, data,
living energy.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.324
Hold on.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.126
It's alive, it's on fire,

07:39.128 --> 07:41.428
and it's
in Bulkhead's brain?

07:41.430 --> 07:42.696
Chill, Miko.

07:42.698 --> 07:45.532
The data's only inhabiting
a fraction of my brain,

07:45.534 --> 07:48.602
infinitesimal by standard
neural-net densities.

07:48.604 --> 07:50.671
Wait.
How do I know all that?

07:50.673 --> 07:53.741
Based on what we witnessed
during our skirmish,

07:53.743 --> 07:56.977
the living data must have been
programmed to eject

07:56.979 --> 07:59.380
when it sensed
unauthorized access.

07:59.382 --> 08:01.315
A security measure.

08:01.317 --> 08:06.487
It would have jettisoned
heavenward, lost to the stars.

08:06.489 --> 08:09.056
Except my fat engine block
got in the way.

08:09.058 --> 08:11.291
Every 'con there
made a grab for it,

08:11.293 --> 08:14.428
but the cylinder doesn't go off
until Miko touches it?

08:14.430 --> 08:17.731
The cylinders originated
from Cybertron's golden age,

08:17.733 --> 08:20.467
predating the Autobot / Decepticon
division.

08:20.469 --> 08:23.837
So it wouldn't consider
any native of Cybertron

08:23.839 --> 08:25.072
to be a reat.

08:25.074 --> 08:29.176
Only alien life forms,
such as humans.

08:30.279 --> 08:33.746
Are we staring at genius
or gibberish?

08:33.749 --> 08:37.684
I do not wish to falsely
rally anyone's hopes,

08:37.687 --> 08:41.455
but these equations
appear to be the formula

08:41.457 --> 08:43.524
for a synthetic energon.

08:44.493 --> 08:46.193
We hit the mother lode?

08:46.195 --> 08:48.629
Miko, do you understand
what this means?

08:48.631 --> 08:49.963
Um...

08:49.965 --> 08:52.166
Energon provides our fuel,
our ammo, our life force.

08:52.168 --> 08:54.768
With the natural stuff
in such short supply

08:54.770 --> 08:55.769
here on Earth,

08:55.771 --> 08:58.205
this could solve a whole lot
of problems.

08:58.207 --> 09:01.875
Such as providing us
with the edge we need

09:01.877 --> 09:04.611
to turn the tide
of this war.

09:04.613 --> 09:08.716
Or handing us the key
to revitalizing Cybertron.

09:08.718 --> 09:10.017
We got the goods,

09:10.019 --> 09:12.920
and all Megatron got
was an empty bucket.

09:12.922 --> 09:16.490
How often do I get to use
my noggin to save the day?

09:19.360 --> 09:21.695
Intersection
of atomic coordinates

09:21.697 --> 09:23.864
indicate convergent
tertiary structures...

09:23.866 --> 09:25.466
Aren't you done yet?!

09:25.468 --> 09:28.035
Resulting
in an asymmetric...

09:28.037 --> 09:29.136
Got to admit,

09:29.138 --> 09:31.805
it's weird seeing Bulk
in brainiac mode.

09:34.944 --> 09:36.610
Vector l1 norm squared.

09:36.612 --> 09:37.811
Break time!

09:37.813 --> 09:41.248
How about a lightning round
of "TNT Street Racer 7"?

09:41.250 --> 09:44.017
Energon temperatures
and volume proportion...

09:44.019 --> 09:44.952
Aw!

09:44.954 --> 09:46.720
Angle trisector
construction.

09:46.722 --> 09:48.956
Got another round
for you to log, Ratchet.

09:48.958 --> 09:52.092
This is Bulkhead's neural net
as you saw it earlier.

09:53.395 --> 09:55.929
This scan was recorded
just minutes ago.

09:55.931 --> 09:57.598
It is as I feared.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.602
The data seems to be
actively and aggressively

10:01.604 --> 10:04.605
rewriting
Bulkhead's neural net.

10:04.607 --> 10:07.541
I had hoped
he was purging the data,

10:07.543 --> 10:11.411
but he seems to be merely
transcribing it as it...

10:11.413 --> 10:14.815
Consumes his mind.

10:14.817 --> 10:16.617
From all indications,

10:16.619 --> 10:20.187
by the time Bulkhead
completes the formula,

10:20.189 --> 10:24.424
his own thoughts, his memories
could be wiped clean.

10:24.426 --> 10:28.195
But if we stop him,
goodbye, synthetic energon.

10:28.197 --> 10:31.932
You assume we possess
a means of stopping him.

10:31.934 --> 10:33.801
I don't exactly have
instant access

10:33.803 --> 10:35.469
to the wisdom
of the ancients.

10:35.471 --> 10:40.174
I will not allow another one
of our own to be sacrificed,

10:40.176 --> 10:41.842
no matter the cost.

10:41.844 --> 10:45.846
If the living data transmitted
itself from the cylinder,

10:45.848 --> 10:49.149
perhaps we could somehow
coax it back inside.

10:49.151 --> 10:51.785
How are we supposed to get it
back from the Decepticons?

10:51.787 --> 10:56.023
Megatron
will bring it to us.

11:01.696 --> 11:04.898
Coefficient quotient
of the subset amplified...

11:04.900 --> 11:07.067
You want amplified?

11:07.069 --> 11:10.404
Proving preceptor's paradox
is nothing of the kind.

11:13.175 --> 11:14.007
Aah!

11:14.009 --> 11:15.809
What is that?!

11:15.811 --> 11:18.312
Metal.
You love this song.

11:18.314 --> 11:20.380
I'm trying to concentrate.

11:21.483 --> 11:23.350
You're starting to sound
just like Ratchet!

11:23.352 --> 11:24.785
Who?

11:28.323 --> 11:31.859
Ratch, I think
Bulk's losing his mind.

11:33.294 --> 11:36.730
You...already know.

11:36.732 --> 11:39.700
Miko, we didn't want
to frighten you.

11:39.702 --> 11:42.703
But rest assured,
Optimus has a plan.

11:42.705 --> 11:45.339
Optimus
isn't Bulkhead's doctor.

11:45.341 --> 11:46.974
I just need to know,

11:46.976 --> 11:50.310
when Bulk's done spitting out
that formula,

11:50.312 --> 11:54.181
he'll go back to being
regular old Bulkhead, right?

11:59.821 --> 12:01.054
Lord Megatron,

12:01.056 --> 12:04.057
we've detected
a familiar energy profile.

12:04.059 --> 12:04.892
The data?

12:04.894 --> 12:06.326
Bulkhead must have left

12:06.328 --> 12:08.562
the shielded radius
of their base.

12:08.564 --> 12:09.997
Breakdown and I will...

12:09.999 --> 12:11.698
Fail me again?

12:17.372 --> 12:19.239
Optimus.

12:19.241 --> 12:23.477
You're certainly not the Autobot
I expected to find here.

12:23.479 --> 12:24.845
But let me guess.

12:24.847 --> 12:28.282
You rigged a transponder
to mimic the frequency

12:28.284 --> 12:29.750
of the data I seek.

12:29.752 --> 12:32.419
Megatron,
I have a proposal.

12:35.523 --> 12:38.091
I'm...Listening.

12:38.093 --> 12:40.027
Surrender the cylinder,

12:40.029 --> 12:43.664
and I will return it to you
fully restored.

12:43.666 --> 12:46.099
This trinket right here?

12:46.101 --> 12:49.036
And, pray tell,
what trifles did it hold

12:49.038 --> 12:51.805
that you are so anxious
to give away?

12:51.807 --> 12:55.609
Accept my terms,
and you will find out.

12:57.279 --> 12:58.679
Do you remember the time

12:58.681 --> 13:01.148
you watched wheeljack
lob his only grenade

13:01.150 --> 13:02.783
into the Decepticon
heat exchanger?

13:02.785 --> 13:03.717
Who?

13:03.719 --> 13:05.919
Wheeljack!
Your best bud?!

13:05.921 --> 13:07.587
Besides me, of course.

13:09.524 --> 13:12.859
Oh! Do you even know
who <i>I</i> am?

13:12.861 --> 13:14.561
Of course.

13:14.563 --> 13:16.163
You're...

13:18.499 --> 13:21.368
Equivalent to the flattening
of the oblate spheroid

13:21.370 --> 13:22.669
to the nth power.

13:22.671 --> 13:26.573
Internal energy of isolated "E"
remains constant.

13:26.575 --> 13:29.943
Keep them coming,
Bulkhead.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.420
Come on.

13:40.422 --> 13:43.457
You want to finish your formula,
don't you?

13:43.459 --> 13:47.260
Do you accept
my proposal?

13:47.262 --> 13:50.263
Lord Megatron.

13:50.265 --> 13:52.199
Give me a moment.

13:52.201 --> 13:56.236
Did you find
what you were looking for?

13:56.238 --> 13:58.105
It's complicated.

13:58.107 --> 14:02.976
Well, breakdown and I
may have located the bogey,

14:02.978 --> 14:04.611
fully charged.

14:04.613 --> 14:05.879
Proceed.

14:05.881 --> 14:11.084
Just one hitch.
We don't have the cylinder.

14:11.086 --> 14:15.489
Then bring me
the head of Bulkhead.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.184
- Look!
- You love monster trucks.

14:19.186 --> 14:22.521
Remember when we snuck in here
after the show last week?

14:22.523 --> 14:24.690
Mass times diffusion rate
squared is constant.

14:24.692 --> 14:26.825
Is any of this
ringing a bell?

14:26.827 --> 14:27.826
Bell curve?

14:27.828 --> 14:29.661
No, no, no.
That wouldn't factor in.

14:29.663 --> 14:32.431
How about our Sunday-morning
dune bashings,

14:32.433 --> 14:35.968
rocking out to slash monkey,
helping me with my homework?

14:35.970 --> 14:37.269
Ha! Trick question!

14:37.271 --> 14:39.304
You know
I don't do homework.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.676
Don't you?

14:43.980 --> 14:45.547
Okay, forget the past.

14:45.549 --> 14:48.316
Starting now,
we can make new memories.

14:48.318 --> 14:51.019
The cube root of the exothermic
energon yield Delta "E"

14:51.021 --> 14:53.288
violates clank's law
of energon conservation.

14:56.492 --> 14:59.327
Bulkhead, I know
somewhere inside,

14:59.329 --> 15:01.796
you will
always remember me,

15:01.798 --> 15:05.700
and I just want you to know
I'll never forget you.

15:05.702 --> 15:07.536
Boo-hoo!

15:07.538 --> 15:11.673
I'm shedding lubricant.

15:11.675 --> 15:15.310
Follow me right now,
or these guys are gonna...

15:15.312 --> 15:17.712
Steal the formula!

15:17.714 --> 15:19.581
My equations?

15:20.883 --> 15:23.752
Come on, come on!

15:23.754 --> 15:26.354
Not like Bulkhead
to run from a fight.

15:30.626 --> 15:32.193
I'm afraid our friend

15:32.195 --> 15:34.863
has had a little too much
to think.

15:34.865 --> 15:36.998
Lord Megatron,
we're good.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.903
Optimus,
upon careful consideration,

15:41.905 --> 15:46.441
if you want the cylinder,
you'll have to take it.

16:01.223 --> 16:04.492
Okay, then.
Fun and games.

16:08.197 --> 16:11.032
Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

16:20.077 --> 16:21.977
The 'cons are scrambling
the signal.

16:21.979 --> 16:24.813
The trisector of the
polygon is an integral subset.

16:24.815 --> 16:25.847
Shh! Quiet!

16:25.849 --> 16:28.516
And whatever you do,
keep still.

16:28.518 --> 16:32.787
I'm gonna see if I can get
far enough to call for backup.

17:01.617 --> 17:04.551
Bulkhead...

17:04.554 --> 17:06.054
Is that you?

17:19.969 --> 17:24.271
Breakdown,
forget the human.

17:24.273 --> 17:26.840
Games are only fun to play...

17:28.612 --> 17:30.378
When you're winning.

17:36.053 --> 17:37.952
I think I'm warm.

17:39.555 --> 17:42.290
En3 divided by the square root
of the propulsion factor

17:42.292 --> 17:43.558
equals...

17:43.560 --> 17:46.294
You painted my paint job!

17:46.296 --> 17:48.596
Prepare for surgery!

17:56.605 --> 18:00.675
Heads, you lose.

18:00.677 --> 18:02.210
No!

18:08.150 --> 18:13.154
Well, in that case,
no one gets it.

18:21.363 --> 18:25.266
Optimus, Bulkhead
and Miko have abandoned base.

18:25.268 --> 18:28.136
I have their ground bridge
coordinates.

18:28.138 --> 18:31.306
Bridge us back immediately.

18:40.917 --> 18:41.883
Aah!

18:41.885 --> 18:44.619
Not again!
Get down!

18:45.855 --> 18:47.756
I did it again?

18:55.498 --> 18:58.299
Bulkhead?

19:01.738 --> 19:03.505
Dead battery.

19:03.507 --> 19:07.275
Megatron will peel our paint
for losing that data.

19:07.277 --> 19:09.911
So we're gonna
have to peel you.

19:15.985 --> 19:18.119
Or peel out of here.

19:29.331 --> 19:31.099
Bulkhead...

19:41.043 --> 19:43.845
The data has been
fully expelled,

19:43.847 --> 19:47.615
but Bulkhead remains
completely unresponsive.

19:47.617 --> 19:50.985
Because the energy took
Bulkhead's mind with it,

19:50.987 --> 19:55.423
heavenward,
lost to the stars.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.896
It's my fault you'll never know
the rest of the formula,

20:01.898 --> 20:05.433
and it's my fault
Bulkhead's gone forever.

20:05.435 --> 20:09.537
Miko, your quick thinking
prevented the formula

20:09.539 --> 20:12.740
from falling
into Decepticon hands.

20:12.742 --> 20:16.811
If anyone would have
backed that play, it's Bulkhead.

20:16.813 --> 20:20.648
It's simply too early to know
the extent of his condition.

20:20.650 --> 20:23.952
Something as simple
as a familiar sight or smell,

20:23.954 --> 20:25.787
perhaps even a sound,

20:25.789 --> 20:28.857
could trigger
Bulkhead's awakening.

21:07.130 --> 21:09.364
Bulkhead?

21:16.439 --> 21:18.673
I love that song!

21:20.643 --> 21:21.676
Miko?
