WEBVTT

00:01.628 --> 00:02.642
Keep everyone back.

00:03.476 --> 00:05.082
You never were
much to look at.

00:05.638 --> 00:06.873
Oh, to us maybe.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.708
For all we know,
this one's a prime specimen,

00:08.742 --> 00:12.081
the Brad pitt
of Skitter world.

00:12.116 --> 00:14.518
Porter says we have to try
to communicate with this thing.

00:14.552 --> 00:16.755
Figure out how it thinks, we can
figure out how to beat it.

00:16.789 --> 00:19.858
You actually think you'll
figure a way to talk to it?

00:19.892 --> 00:21.929
I get it in a controlled
environment, give it a shot.

00:21.964 --> 00:25.433
A lot depends on what it's got
underneath the hood.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.838
I wouldn't
underestimate them.

00:27.872 --> 00:29.139
See the eyes?

00:29.173 --> 00:31.542
It's studying us as much
as we're studying them.

00:31.576 --> 00:33.643
I mean,
even if he wanted to chat,

00:33.677 --> 00:35.912
vocalizations could extend
above or below

00:35.946 --> 00:37.512
the range
of human hearing.

00:37.547 --> 00:38.813
I mean,
for all we know,

00:38.848 --> 00:40.982
he could be
cussing us out right now.

00:41.017 --> 00:42.950
I can almost
guarantee it.

00:44.552 --> 00:45.919
Get that damn thing
in the cage!

00:45.953 --> 00:48.788
All right, get that thing
in the cage! Get him in!

00:50.658 --> 00:52.026
Get him in there!

00:52.060 --> 00:56.199
Get him in there!

01:00.705 --> 01:02.006
Yeah.

01:03.810 --> 01:06.111
I remember you, too.

01:23.430 --> 01:26.598
Well, uh, it seems
to have settled for now.

01:26.632 --> 01:29.234
Might want
to keep your distance.

01:29.268 --> 01:31.202
I might.

01:34.975 --> 01:38.679
Time for our patient's
morning fix.

01:38.713 --> 01:41.815
Meet me in the command post
in five.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.795 --> 01:55.329
This bike shop, right?
Anyway, she calls me up.

01:55.363 --> 01:57.531
She's like, "Hey, Johnny, you
want a new ride?" I'm like --

01:57.566 --> 01:59.433
Captain.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.770
Pope tells me there's a
motorcycle shop near Somerville.

02:02.804 --> 02:04.504
It's well off
the main highway,

02:04.539 --> 02:06.773
so there's a chance
it's not picked clean.

02:06.808 --> 02:08.407
I want you to take a team,
check it out.

02:08.442 --> 02:09.576
Wait, what?

02:09.610 --> 02:11.111
You're sending me
after bikes? No.

02:11.145 --> 02:13.915
My team's ready to get Ben.
Porter gave us permission.

02:13.949 --> 02:15.383
He gave you permission
to rescue one kid.

02:15.418 --> 02:16.885
That kid
turned out to be Rick.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.388
- Doesn't change what I need to do.
- I understand that.

02:19.422 --> 02:21.524
I also understand that Mike's
son is a work in progress

02:21.558 --> 02:23.693
and Harris is going through
the last of our heavy drugs

02:23.727 --> 02:25.795
on the detox.
So we'll get more.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.697
Yes, we will.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.467
And it will be a hell of a lot easier
when we have more bikes.

02:30.502 --> 02:33.937
One objective
leads to the next.

02:33.971 --> 02:38.908
First the bikes,
then the drugs, then your son.

02:38.943 --> 02:41.711
All right.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.914
So, when do we leave?

02:44.948 --> 02:46.716
You don't.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.084
Pope knows where it is.

02:48.118 --> 02:49.718
He could draw me
a map.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.455
If I'm doing this, I'm doing it
with people I trust.

02:52.489 --> 02:55.391
It's your call, but I scored
my last ride from this place.

02:55.426 --> 02:58.395
I know the layout.
I know the streets.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.630
And I can't draw
for crap.

03:00.665 --> 03:04.301
We're down one rider
since we lost Karen.

03:10.042 --> 03:13.545
I talk, you listen,
and no weapon.

03:13.579 --> 03:14.913
You go unarmed.

03:14.947 --> 03:18.584
Unarmed? What am I, Canadian?

03:19.653 --> 03:21.821
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

03:28.729 --> 03:29.995
No congestion.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.598
His lungs
are completely clear.

03:32.632 --> 03:34.600
I know
this is gonna sound weird,

03:34.634 --> 03:37.002
but are you sure
Rick had cystic fibrosis?

03:37.037 --> 03:39.905
"Five specialists
in three states" sure.

03:39.939 --> 03:43.041
Before the invasion,
he could barely breathe.

03:43.075 --> 03:45.843
I had to put him
on a nebulizer twice a day

03:45.878 --> 03:47.578
just to clear his lungs.

03:47.612 --> 03:49.512
Why?

03:49.547 --> 03:50.847
I'm no expert,

03:50.881 --> 03:53.716
but full remission like this
is extremely rare.

03:53.751 --> 03:55.084
Meaning what?

03:55.119 --> 03:58.755
<i>That...thing that he had
on his back cured him?</i>

03:58.789 --> 04:00.724
I don't know.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.432
When's he gonna wake up?

04:09.466 --> 04:13.303
Dr. Harris
said later today.

04:21.712 --> 04:23.512
How is Rick?

04:23.546 --> 04:24.913
We're weaning him
off opiates.

04:24.948 --> 04:26.715
24 hours and we should know
if we have him back.

04:26.749 --> 04:28.984
Look, I totally understand if
you're holding back with Mike,

04:29.018 --> 04:30.652
but I really
want to know everything.

04:30.686 --> 04:32.087
So how dangerous is this?

04:32.121 --> 04:33.756
As surgery? Not very.

04:33.791 --> 04:36.526
As long as we have enough drugs
to counteract the harness,

04:36.560 --> 04:39.062
it's basically
cutting steel.

04:39.097 --> 04:41.565
I'm sorry
you couldn't get Ben.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.535
I know. Mike is torn up
about what happened.

04:44.570 --> 04:47.839
Yeah, well, it's just a man
trying to save his son.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.975
So this morning's attitude
was for Harris.

04:50.009 --> 04:52.577
I noticed he couldn't get away
from you fast enough.

04:52.612 --> 04:54.947
I appreciate your concern
over my state of mind.

04:54.981 --> 04:56.548
I am your doctor.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.851
I, uh...

04:59.886 --> 05:01.786
Harris told me
that he saw my wife die,

05:01.821 --> 05:04.656
and it's hard for me to look
at him and not remember that.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.491
Oh, God.

05:06.525 --> 05:08.560
I'm sorry.

05:08.594 --> 05:11.829
At least
she was with a friend.

05:15.068 --> 05:16.468
Yeah.

05:16.503 --> 05:19.238
Um, I got to go.

05:24.078 --> 05:25.446
Sir, they're back.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.981
You were due back
two hours ago.

05:27.015 --> 05:29.384
Recon takes longer
when you're on foot.

05:29.418 --> 05:31.487
The transportation issue's
being addressed.

05:31.521 --> 05:32.988
What's your report?

05:33.022 --> 05:34.423
I saw some harness kids

05:34.457 --> 05:36.758
being led into that hospital
off of Route 2.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.460
Same hospital
you saw before?

05:38.494 --> 05:41.029
It looks like they're still
using it as a home base.

05:41.063 --> 05:44.066
And one of your fighter jocks
thought they saw Mason's kid.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.601
Any sign of Karen?

05:45.635 --> 05:46.835
Didn't see her.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.003
Right. Dismissed.

05:48.038 --> 05:50.506
Captain,
I don't mind taking orders,

05:50.540 --> 05:51.941
but I'd appreciate it

05:51.975 --> 05:53.810
if you'd tell your fighters
I'm not the enemy.

05:53.844 --> 05:57.114
You had them keeping tabs on me,
didn't you?

05:58.550 --> 05:59.850
I did.

05:59.884 --> 06:01.819
You were found with Pope.

06:01.853 --> 06:03.488
I was in his vicinity.

06:03.522 --> 06:04.923
I wasn't with him.

06:04.957 --> 06:06.358
If it weren't for me,

06:06.392 --> 06:09.094
you wouldn't have
a second-in-command.

06:09.128 --> 06:11.396
Those convicts
trusted you with a gun.

06:11.431 --> 06:13.398
That whole time
you were with them,

06:13.432 --> 06:15.833
you never thought
about using it before?

06:17.969 --> 06:21.905
Yeah, every second
of every day.

06:21.939 --> 06:24.140
On myself at first.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.808
And then on them.

06:25.843 --> 06:29.044
What about now?

06:30.347 --> 06:33.282
I'm just taking it
a day at a time.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.898
- All right?
- Yep.

06:46.932 --> 06:49.535
- We ready?
- Ready.

06:49.569 --> 06:51.537
Dad.

06:51.571 --> 06:53.071
Matt, what are you doing here?
You should be in class.

06:53.106 --> 06:54.739
I ditched when I heard
you were leaving.

06:54.774 --> 06:55.974
I want to come with you.

06:56.008 --> 06:57.142
Sorry, Shrimp.

06:57.176 --> 06:59.744
You got to be
that tall to ride.

06:59.778 --> 07:01.012
But I mean it.
I want to help.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.647
You are helping
by going to class,

07:02.681 --> 07:04.448
keeping an eye on things
while hal and I are gone.

07:04.483 --> 07:06.383
But I can fight, too.

07:06.418 --> 07:08.385
Some of the other kids are learning
how to load guns, even shoot.

07:08.419 --> 07:09.853
Well,
that's the other kids.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.421
- But, dad --
- Matt, I said no.

07:11.456 --> 07:13.723
We'll be back soon.
Go on. Go back to class.

07:13.757 --> 07:15.425
Scott, will you take him?

07:15.460 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, come on.
Come on, Matt.

07:16.994 --> 07:19.763
You're not doing your boy
any favors, you know.

07:19.797 --> 07:21.498
Skitter's come knocking,

07:21.532 --> 07:24.067
the kid should at least have
a chance to defend himself.

07:24.101 --> 07:26.369
If I want any parenting advice
from an ex-con,

07:26.404 --> 07:27.938
I'll ask for it.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.044
You know,
Pope's got a point.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.881
Matt deserves
a childhood.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.618
One day, when you have kids,
you'll understand.

07:39.652 --> 07:41.119
Me? Kids?

07:41.154 --> 07:43.274
Dream on.

07:43.275 --> 07:45.677
I will.

07:54.929 --> 07:56.496
How much farther?

07:56.530 --> 07:59.165
Half a mile or so.

08:01.868 --> 08:03.902
What the hell
you grinning about?

08:03.936 --> 08:05.870
I'm just
enjoying the air.

08:05.905 --> 08:08.806
Didn't mean to piss off
the company gangbanger.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.642
Black man with a gun --
that's your default?

08:11.676 --> 08:14.445
I just call them
as I see them.

08:14.479 --> 08:16.313
So, what were you?

08:16.348 --> 08:18.849
Blood?
Crips? Slytherin?

08:18.884 --> 08:20.818
Actually, Mr. Pope,

08:20.852 --> 08:23.687
I was part of the biggest gang
in the world.

08:23.722 --> 08:25.323
I was Boston P.D.

08:25.357 --> 08:27.025
Thought I smelled
a little ham.

08:27.059 --> 08:28.526
You know what?

08:28.561 --> 08:30.396
You know, you laugh that up,
convict. Okay?

08:30.430 --> 08:33.432
Because one of these days when
we don't need you anymore,

08:33.466 --> 08:35.400
me and you -- we're gonna
have a little talk

08:35.434 --> 08:37.937
about my friend Click.

08:39.839 --> 08:41.373
Being awfully quiet.

08:41.407 --> 08:43.674
I got nothing
to talk about.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.877
Well,
if you want to talk --

08:45.911 --> 08:49.913
Look, dad, I just got some
things to think about, okay?

08:49.948 --> 08:51.181
But thank you.

08:54.351 --> 08:57.386
This thing with Karen --
it must be rough.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.055
Oh, it's gonna be rough
for a while.

09:00.090 --> 09:03.258
When you see him like this,
like a soldier,

09:03.293 --> 09:06.294
it's easy to forget
that he's only 16.

09:06.329 --> 09:07.829
He's holding it all in.

09:07.863 --> 09:09.631
Well,
he's his mother's son.

09:09.665 --> 09:12.734
With me, it was always kind of
like talking to a brick wall,

09:12.768 --> 09:14.035
but Rebecca --

09:14.070 --> 09:16.037
she kind of always knew
the right thing to say.

09:16.072 --> 09:17.372
Yeah.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.474
Time like this,
I miss her a lot.

09:19.508 --> 09:21.910
What do you think
she would have told him?

09:21.945 --> 09:25.481
I don't know,
but it would have been perfect.

09:25.515 --> 09:26.749
Maybe I'm lucky.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.552
I didn't have anyone
when they hit.

09:29.586 --> 09:33.455
I see you worry about them --
hal, Matt.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.857
Wouldn't want that.

09:34.891 --> 09:38.393
Oh, I worried about them
before the invasion, too.

09:38.428 --> 09:40.629
Trust me --
hal with a set of car keys

09:40.663 --> 09:42.664
is just as frightening
as a Mech.

09:42.699 --> 09:45.601
Same worries,
higher stakes.

09:45.635 --> 09:48.504
Hey, come on, guys.
Let's hurry it up!

09:48.538 --> 09:52.474
Sooner we get those bikes,
sooner we can go after Ben.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.931
W-what are you doing?

10:13.965 --> 10:17.734
Um, saying a prayer
for the missing.

10:17.769 --> 10:19.937
It's just something
I like to do.

10:19.971 --> 10:23.074
You think it helps them?

10:23.108 --> 10:24.442
It helps me.

10:24.476 --> 10:26.378
You don't know
any of these people.

10:26.412 --> 10:28.347
You're not even
from Boston.

10:28.381 --> 10:30.316
I heard you talking to Hal
one night

10:30.350 --> 10:31.984
about how you grew up
in Mexico City.

10:32.019 --> 10:35.355
Well, my mom and dad bought
a house here when I was 10,

10:35.390 --> 10:38.058
and my dad would go
back and forth for business

10:38.092 --> 10:40.927
while I went to school.

10:40.961 --> 10:44.631
I was freshman pre-med at
Wellesley when they attacked.

10:44.665 --> 10:47.000
Wellesley's not in Boston.

10:47.034 --> 10:48.368
It's in Wellesley.

10:49.704 --> 10:52.706
Okay, 617 snob, my parents'
house was in J.P.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.175
Is that Boston enough
for you?

10:55.209 --> 10:57.744
W-what part of J.P.?

11:00.548 --> 11:03.650
The part where people
lost their faith.

11:12.526 --> 11:16.296
Earth. This planet.

11:16.330 --> 11:19.565
So, this is your game plan?
Our planet.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.569
Show it pictures, hope it says
the word in Skitterese?

11:23.603 --> 11:25.971
Our galaxy.

11:26.006 --> 11:28.540
Stars.

11:28.575 --> 11:30.475
Outer space.

11:30.509 --> 11:33.045
Well, you know,
if that doesn't work,

11:33.079 --> 11:35.514
you can
try exchanging recipes.

11:35.549 --> 11:39.518
No curiosity,
no fear, no remorse.

11:39.552 --> 11:43.722
Maybe that's why it's so easy
for them to kill us.

11:43.757 --> 11:45.524
Believe what you want.

11:45.559 --> 11:48.494
But I think it's scared
out of its mind.

11:48.529 --> 11:53.567
I wonder what it sees
when it's looking at us.

11:53.601 --> 11:56.003
Are we as hideous to it?

11:56.037 --> 11:57.104
As strange?

11:57.138 --> 11:59.940
Yeah,
that's a good question.

11:59.974 --> 12:01.908
I got an idea.

12:12.953 --> 12:14.820
This the radio
you wanted to show me?

12:14.855 --> 12:16.655
Oh, yeah.

12:16.690 --> 12:19.892
Yeah, I made it out of an old
fallout-shelter survival kit

12:19.926 --> 12:21.661
I found
in the basement.

12:21.696 --> 12:23.029
Doesn't need a battery?

12:23.063 --> 12:25.531
No, you just crank up the handle
to power it up.

12:25.566 --> 12:27.467
You could listen
to the Red Sox game.

12:27.501 --> 12:29.602
The other regiments will be
working on their radios.

12:29.636 --> 12:30.970
We need to monitor
the frequencies,

12:31.004 --> 12:32.705
see if
they're up and running.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.941
But I don't want it to take you
away from making explosives.

12:34.975 --> 12:36.643
That's what I was thinking,

12:36.677 --> 12:40.915
which is why I brought along
a very capable volunteer.

12:40.949 --> 12:42.417
Come on.

12:42.451 --> 12:45.353
See, all he has to do
is wind the handle

12:45.388 --> 12:47.356
and slowly turn the dial.

12:47.390 --> 12:51.794
He's looking
for something to do.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.664
Right.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.501
Guess what.

12:57.535 --> 13:00.837
I just made you
the communications officer.

13:00.872 --> 13:02.105
Cool.

13:06.944 --> 13:10.246
We need to stay
inside the tree line.

13:10.281 --> 13:12.748
- Pope!
- I knew I smelled something.

13:12.783 --> 13:14.583
Shh.

13:15.785 --> 13:18.921
Skitters.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.563
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shh, shh.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.865
You'll wake 'em.

13:38.514 --> 13:42.050
So, they fly across the
Universe and wipe out mankind

13:42.084 --> 13:43.360
and they sleep like bats.

13:43.361 --> 13:44.995
At least they're sleeping

13:45.029 --> 13:47.364
and not having
Skitter group sex.

13:49.434 --> 13:51.834
I didn't think they slept
during the day at all.

13:51.869 --> 13:53.035
They're not nocturnal.

13:53.069 --> 13:54.536
I'm guessing
they catch a pile of shut-eye

13:54.571 --> 13:56.104
whenever and wherever
they can.

13:56.139 --> 13:59.241
Just like soldiers anywhere.

14:03.030 --> 14:05.165
Mechs --
north and south.

14:05.199 --> 14:06.533
Active?

14:06.567 --> 14:08.201
Sleep mode.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.370
What the hell
are you waiting for?

14:11.405 --> 14:13.873
- Let's hose 'em!
- As much as I love to kill Skitters,

14:13.907 --> 14:15.175
as soon as
we open up on them,

14:15.209 --> 14:16.743
those Mechs are gonna
open up on us.

14:18.212 --> 14:20.147
Engaging them
is not the mission.

14:20.181 --> 14:21.849
Let's go.

14:23.051 --> 14:25.620
They're like fish
in a barrel.

14:25.654 --> 14:27.689
Can we get around them?

14:27.723 --> 14:29.824
Stick to the trees,
go past, double back.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.892
Only adds a half mile.

14:35.930 --> 14:38.198
Water?

14:38.232 --> 14:41.468
Are you thirsty?
Want some water?

14:59.188 --> 15:01.255
It's okay.

15:13.637 --> 15:16.205
Get your damn hand
out of there.

15:16.239 --> 15:18.574
What are you doing?

15:18.608 --> 15:20.509
I thought we might try to provoke
it with a little visual stimuli.

15:20.543 --> 15:22.044
Hey, chief.

15:22.078 --> 15:24.680
You remember that Skitter
that Pope and his boys killed.

15:24.714 --> 15:27.183
Watch this.
Remember this guy?

15:30.253 --> 15:32.822
What was that?

15:32.856 --> 15:34.657
Static.

15:34.692 --> 15:37.126
I know.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.728
It wasn't there
a moment ago.

15:45.168 --> 15:47.436
Lock! No!

15:53.077 --> 15:54.877
Want a friend?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.412
Get a dog.

16:07.990 --> 16:09.791
And may we be truly thankful.

16:09.825 --> 16:13.360
In the name of the father,
of the son, the holy spirit.

16:15.898 --> 16:17.097
What?

16:17.132 --> 16:20.801
You're lucky you still believe
in something.

16:24.205 --> 16:26.673
Did I hear right?

16:26.707 --> 16:29.509
Mason and his crew are taking
Pope on this motorcycle raid?

16:29.544 --> 16:31.511
You got a problem
with that?

16:31.545 --> 16:34.682
No, I don't.
But they will.

16:38.754 --> 16:41.790
This place didn't get hit
like they did down --

16:41.824 --> 16:42.958
Watch out there --

16:42.992 --> 16:44.292
didn't get hit
like they did downtown,

16:44.327 --> 16:46.061
but the, uh, the cooties --

16:46.095 --> 16:47.996
I tell you, they sure as hell
made their presence known.

16:48.031 --> 16:50.832
Actually, I scored one of my
first rides from this place.

16:55.003 --> 16:57.170
All right,
let's check the tanks.

16:57.205 --> 16:59.172
Probably empty,
but you never know.

16:59.206 --> 17:02.008
<i>Mi negra Amor.
And just the off-roads.</i>

17:02.042 --> 17:04.710
We don't need
any recliners on wheels.

17:04.744 --> 17:08.146
Professor,
you have no sense of style.

17:08.181 --> 17:10.648
Is that the kind of bike
you bought here, Pope?

17:10.684 --> 17:12.451
Oh, I never
bought a bike here.

17:12.486 --> 17:13.653
<i>I said I got a bike here.</i>

17:13.686 --> 17:15.521
I sure as hell
didn't buy it.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.089
Hell,
I didn't even need it.

17:17.124 --> 17:19.025
I was just trying to impress
a lady. It worked, too.

17:19.059 --> 17:21.794
Pretty proud of your criminal
past, aren't you?

17:21.829 --> 17:23.696
I was good at it.

17:23.731 --> 17:25.898
They're all empty.

17:25.933 --> 17:27.532
There's a repair bay
back here,

17:27.568 --> 17:29.202
couple of bikes in pieces,
tanks of gas.

17:29.236 --> 17:30.670
All right, take Pope,

17:30.704 --> 17:32.438
see if you can find
another empty gas can

17:32.472 --> 17:34.073
we can fill
and take back with us.

17:34.107 --> 17:36.141
Let's put some gas
in these things,

17:36.176 --> 17:37.910
see if we can
start them up.

17:37.944 --> 17:40.712
It's Dai, right?
What do they call you for short?

17:40.746 --> 17:42.747
If there's anything else you
think we could use back there,

17:42.782 --> 17:44.716
grab it.

17:54.761 --> 17:58.097
Well,
this is gonna suck.

18:04.104 --> 18:06.973
Karen would have
loved this.

18:09.843 --> 18:12.077
What would
Karen have loved?

18:12.112 --> 18:15.481
She's no girly girl,
at least not since we knew her,

18:15.515 --> 18:17.883
probably never was,
but...

18:17.917 --> 18:20.818
She'd have taken this.

18:20.853 --> 18:23.554
We can leave an I.O.U.

18:23.589 --> 18:26.691
Nah.

18:26.725 --> 18:29.693
We're not giving up
on her.

18:29.728 --> 18:30.961
Oh, I know.

18:30.996 --> 18:35.701
I just...can't help think
about what's happened.

18:39.739 --> 18:42.074
Well, I don't think Karen would
want you to blame yourself.

18:42.109 --> 18:43.676
She's a high-school senior,
Dad.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.144
She's not a soldier.

18:45.178 --> 18:47.713
She should have never even
been put in that situation.

18:47.748 --> 18:50.483
Well, we all wish
that had gone differently.

18:50.517 --> 18:52.918
Listen, Karen knew
how dangerous it was,

18:52.953 --> 18:54.687
and she came anyway

18:54.721 --> 18:57.556
because she knew how much
getting Ben back means to us.

18:57.591 --> 18:58.691
So, that's it?

18:58.725 --> 19:00.193
We should move on?

19:03.097 --> 19:05.431
I think...

19:05.466 --> 19:08.735
your mom
might have said to...

19:08.769 --> 19:13.706
Hold on to the memory
and let the rest of it come.

19:13.741 --> 19:16.109
Actually, she would have said
"Suck it up."

19:16.143 --> 19:17.644
Really?

19:17.679 --> 19:19.780
And I'm sorry,

19:19.815 --> 19:23.051
but if that was your attempt
at parental advice,

19:23.085 --> 19:24.719
that was pretty lame.

19:24.753 --> 19:27.122
She was always
better at that than me.

19:27.156 --> 19:29.958
Yeah, she was.

19:31.794 --> 19:33.427
Come on.

19:33.462 --> 19:35.829
Let's go see if we can help
Anthony with those bikes.

19:41.936 --> 19:43.203
You can't cut into it.

19:43.237 --> 19:44.604
It's a living creature.

19:44.638 --> 19:46.873
It's a Skitter.
It's not a human being.

19:46.907 --> 19:48.507
At most, it's vivisection.

19:48.541 --> 19:50.642
You can't tell me you got
a problem with vivisection

19:50.677 --> 19:51.977
or you never would have made it
through med school.

19:52.011 --> 19:54.012
Our job is to communicate
with it,

19:54.047 --> 19:55.113
not just make it scream.

19:55.148 --> 19:57.249
How's Pumpkinhead
doing with his ABCs?

19:57.283 --> 20:00.119
If there's a way that we can
figure out what it wants

20:00.153 --> 20:01.654
and learn about our enemy --

20:01.688 --> 20:03.823
We know what it wants.
It wants to exterminate us!

20:03.857 --> 20:05.625
Look,
they killed my family.

20:05.659 --> 20:06.993
I would like nothing more

20:07.027 --> 20:09.563
than to take an ax
and cut that thing's head off.

20:09.597 --> 20:11.698
But Porter's orders
were clear.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.233
We need to attempt
communication.

20:13.268 --> 20:14.735
I believe he's right.

20:14.769 --> 20:17.805
That's a very noble speech.
That's very noble.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.440
But it's my call.

20:19.475 --> 20:23.078
I'm not gonna be second-guessed
by a pediatrician.

20:51.798 --> 20:53.866
Ricky?

20:59.772 --> 21:01.606
Who are you?

21:03.109 --> 21:05.109
It's me. It's dad.

21:05.901 --> 21:08.335
Who are you?

21:08.369 --> 21:11.138
I'm...

21:11.172 --> 21:13.406
I'm your father.

21:21.082 --> 21:24.318
Father?

21:33.430 --> 21:35.364
Father.

22:08.347 --> 22:10.582
So...

22:10.616 --> 22:14.485
That boy in there --
he's my son.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.888
<i>He's everything to me,</i>

22:16.922 --> 22:19.524
the only thing
that kept me going.

22:22.261 --> 22:26.130
And when he woke up just now,
he didn't know me.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.567
But he's here,

22:30.602 --> 22:33.370
and he's healthy,

22:33.404 --> 22:35.705
probably because of the harness
you put on him.

22:37.608 --> 22:40.978
That's why
you get this chance

22:41.012 --> 22:44.482
to live or not.

22:48.054 --> 22:49.455
Hi.

22:49.489 --> 22:52.525
Hey, Annie.

22:52.559 --> 22:53.826
You guys hungry?

22:53.861 --> 22:55.428
Is something wrong?

22:55.463 --> 22:57.797
You usually
only seek me out

22:57.832 --> 22:59.799
when you need advice
on a personal problem.

22:59.834 --> 23:03.002
I've been busy.
You've been hiding.

23:04.771 --> 23:06.806
Annie, sweetheart,
you can keep pretending

23:06.840 --> 23:08.207
that everything's all right,

23:08.241 --> 23:10.041
but after what
you've been through...

23:13.779 --> 23:15.480
You're alive right now

23:15.514 --> 23:16.781
because they want to know

23:16.815 --> 23:18.916
if you're capable
of communicating with us.

23:18.951 --> 23:22.453
I want you to talk to me.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.524
Explain yourself.

23:28.660 --> 23:32.063
We're gonna start simple.

23:39.271 --> 23:41.873
All you got to do
is point one of your fingers

23:41.907 --> 23:45.510
at any picture here
and make a sound.

23:48.881 --> 23:50.715
How did you find
our planet?

23:50.750 --> 23:52.917
What made you decide
to attack us?

24:15.672 --> 24:19.607
So, maybe
you didn't understand me.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.483
Or you need
some motivation.

24:30.885 --> 24:33.753
I didn't --
I didn't touch it.

24:35.756 --> 24:38.258
It's nice
to hear static again.

24:38.292 --> 24:41.828
Yeah, we've been hearing these
short bursts every now and then,

24:41.862 --> 24:44.463
but...
This low wash just --

24:44.498 --> 24:46.865
just happened
a minute ago.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.301
What's causing it?

24:50.336 --> 24:53.471
I haven't
the faintest idea.

24:53.505 --> 24:55.239
I'm not gonna shoot you.

24:55.274 --> 24:57.941
Now we're getting
somewhere.

24:57.976 --> 25:03.046
Point at a picture
and make a sound.

25:04.115 --> 25:06.283
Don't you look at my son!

25:06.317 --> 25:08.719
You look at the pictures
and make a sound.

25:11.422 --> 25:14.491
Point and speak.

25:14.525 --> 25:15.925
I said speak!

25:31.743 --> 25:34.211
I was just trying
to make it talk.

25:34.246 --> 25:35.880
By sticking a gun
in its mouth?

25:35.914 --> 25:39.317
Our Skitter's breathing
and heart seem fine.

25:39.351 --> 25:41.152
So why'd it just collapse?

25:41.186 --> 25:43.621
Uh, well, in dissections,
I found a nerve bundle

25:43.655 --> 25:45.590
located just above
the soft palate.

25:45.624 --> 25:47.425
Could be
a pressure point.

25:47.459 --> 25:50.494
There's no bone to separate
the brain from the soft palate,

25:50.528 --> 25:52.529
so you probably
gave it a concussion.

25:52.564 --> 25:54.465
You knocked it out.
So, it's vulnerable.

25:54.499 --> 25:56.134
Well,
yeah, I suppose,

25:56.168 --> 25:58.669
but if you're close enough
to put a gun in its mouth,

25:58.704 --> 26:00.439
I suggest
pulling the trigger.

26:00.473 --> 26:04.276
So, this just happened
five minutes ago?

26:04.311 --> 26:06.579
You wanted to see me?

26:06.613 --> 26:09.349
Dr. Glass wants to go in for a
treasure hunt inside the Skitter's skull.

26:09.383 --> 26:12.786
Why? Is this the Skitter
that Mike attacked in the lab?

26:12.820 --> 26:16.489
No. This is the one
that Pope and his boys shot.

26:16.524 --> 26:17.691
We're gonna open him up.

26:17.725 --> 26:19.326
I-I'm not sure
I follow.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.927
Tell Dr. Harris
how you heard

26:20.961 --> 26:23.396
those loud bursts of static
on your radio.

26:23.430 --> 26:26.166
Okay, well, there was, uh,
one right around lunch.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.901
I remember them
banging the pans.

26:27.935 --> 26:29.536
Which is the same time you
brought this one in

26:29.570 --> 26:31.405
to provoke the one
next door.

26:31.439 --> 26:33.907
Yeah,
and the second burst...

26:33.942 --> 26:36.242
Mm...Well,
you were with me.

26:36.277 --> 26:38.345
Yeah, it's the same time Mike was
sticking a gun in the Skitter's mouth.

26:38.379 --> 26:39.946
She thinks the static
may be caused

26:39.981 --> 26:41.281
by the Skitter's reaction.

26:41.316 --> 26:43.250
You're not saying
that the Skitters

26:43.284 --> 26:44.485
have radios in their heads?

26:44.519 --> 26:46.753
Oh, yeah, that's exactly
what she's saying.

26:46.788 --> 26:48.922
So what should
I be looking for here?

26:48.957 --> 26:50.457
Tubes? Transistors?

26:51.593 --> 26:54.494
Subwoofer? No?

26:55.730 --> 26:58.732
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

26:58.767 --> 27:03.137
Well, there's one.

27:03.172 --> 27:06.374
All right, let's see what else
we can get started.

27:06.409 --> 27:09.678
This thing's drier
than a nun in West Texas.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.582
You got all there is?
Let's go.

27:30.567 --> 27:31.801
What happened?

27:31.835 --> 27:34.970
I don't know.
Guess he clocked me.

27:35.005 --> 27:37.573
Great. No wonder he wanted to
help us with the motorcycles.

27:37.607 --> 27:39.342
He was planning on bolting
the whole time.

27:39.376 --> 27:40.476
One less mouth to feed.

27:40.511 --> 27:42.745
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

27:52.555 --> 27:55.490
Rise and shine.

28:04.434 --> 28:05.935
That wasn't good.

28:08.838 --> 28:11.473
- What is that?
- It looks like Pope's work.

28:11.508 --> 28:13.375
That's gonna
draw some attention.

29:32.717 --> 29:34.050
Find anything?

29:34.876 --> 29:36.132
The corpse is too old.

29:36.133 --> 29:38.234
It was mush in there.

29:40.136 --> 29:44.106
Oh, well, there's your proof
right there.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.607
Of what?

29:45.641 --> 29:47.675
What? That the Skitter
and the static are unrelated.

29:47.710 --> 29:50.512
It's not being provoked.
We're all in here.

29:50.547 --> 29:52.214
It's alone.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.682
I mean, unless it's out there
hanging itself right now.

29:53.717 --> 29:55.318
Ricky's in there.

29:59.557 --> 30:01.658
Ricky. Rick.

30:01.693 --> 30:03.828
Ricky! Ricky!

30:05.064 --> 30:07.164
No, no, no, no! Get back!
Hold him, hold him, hold him!

30:07.199 --> 30:10.334
Get that thing
off of him!

30:11.737 --> 30:13.404
What do you want
from us?

30:14.840 --> 30:17.608
You want to hurt me.

30:17.643 --> 30:20.244
We just want to know
why you're here.

30:20.279 --> 30:22.046
What the hell
does he think he's doing?

30:22.080 --> 30:25.349
He thinks
he's talking to the Skitter.

30:25.383 --> 30:27.384
So, what do you want?

30:27.419 --> 30:29.653
Let me go.

30:29.687 --> 30:31.455
No, I can't do that.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.758
This child
is one of ours.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.694
Not anymore.
We cut off his harness.

30:36.729 --> 30:39.097
Then I'll be punished.
We're gonna help you.

30:39.131 --> 30:40.632
- Help me?
- We're gonna help you, Ricky.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.867
Shut up.
He's not your son.

30:44.436 --> 30:46.605
How can we help you?

30:48.507 --> 30:49.841
Kill me.

30:49.875 --> 30:51.275
Stop it, stop it!

30:51.310 --> 30:52.810
Ricky.

31:04.356 --> 31:07.325
He put the harness on.

31:07.359 --> 31:10.428
He wanted to wear it.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.730
How could he do that
to himself?

31:26.243 --> 31:28.344
- Did you find Pope?
- Only what he left behind.

31:28.378 --> 31:29.645
He blew up that Skitter nest.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.280
Where's your bike?

31:31.314 --> 31:33.482
I ditched it after I saw
what's coming up the road.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.618
Kids, harness kids,
heading our way.

31:48.498 --> 31:50.566
Oh, man.

31:52.435 --> 31:54.637
- What do we do, dad?
- Hold your fire!

32:04.580 --> 32:07.249
There must be
a Skitter nearby,

32:07.283 --> 32:09.218
guiding them,
giving them orders.

32:15.093 --> 32:17.260
Aah!
Come on, come on!

32:24.370 --> 32:27.405
- You okay?
- I've been better.

32:29.408 --> 32:31.175
What are we gonna do?

32:31.209 --> 32:33.744
I don't know.

32:33.778 --> 32:36.279
I know it's horrible...
And I hate it, but --

32:36.314 --> 32:37.547
No!

32:37.582 --> 32:39.482
Look, man, we got to
defend ourselves.

32:39.517 --> 32:41.050
We're not shooting kids!

32:41.085 --> 32:43.252
Look for the Skitter
controlling them.

32:43.287 --> 32:45.521
If we stop it,
maybe we can stop them.

32:48.692 --> 32:50.126
They move together.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.729
They seem to only shoot
when there's a target.

33:16.422 --> 33:19.291
- You all right? Still with me?
- Oh, yeah.

33:22.996 --> 33:25.864
I think we found your Skitter.

33:40.479 --> 33:42.480
What about those kids?

33:44.416 --> 33:46.351
Next time.

33:57.733 --> 34:00.009
Skitters have Mechs,
superior weaponry.

34:00.010 --> 34:01.844
Why do they need
to harm children?

34:01.879 --> 34:03.313
Human shield.

34:03.347 --> 34:04.856
We've been doing it
for thousands of years --

34:04.857 --> 34:05.991
psychological warfare.

34:06.025 --> 34:07.993
It worked.

34:08.027 --> 34:10.830
You couldn't shoot them.
No one would be able to.

34:10.864 --> 34:12.431
Well, we'll figure it out.

34:12.466 --> 34:13.766
There's a silver lining.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.068
I'm not seeing it.

34:15.101 --> 34:16.803
Well, the more
that we get to know them,

34:16.837 --> 34:18.571
the more we see they're
not so different from us,

34:18.605 --> 34:19.938
which means we can
understand them,

34:19.974 --> 34:22.141
which means we might be able
to gain them back.

34:22.176 --> 34:24.511
We figure out how, we got
a good shot at beating them.

34:24.545 --> 34:26.679
We're a long way
from figuring that out.

34:26.714 --> 34:29.683
Well, we know a hell of a lot more
about them today than we did yesterday.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.385
You know,
your optimism's

34:31.418 --> 34:33.420
starting to get
a little annoying.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.359
Would it help
if I was a pessimist?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.496
Hey, captain, tomorrow,

34:42.531 --> 34:44.498
I'm gonna start looking
for the drugs we need

34:44.532 --> 34:46.699
for those operations,
and then I'm gonna go get Ben

34:46.735 --> 34:48.335
and as many kids
as I can grab.

34:50.472 --> 34:52.672
Permission granted.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.409
If mine
were still out there,

34:56.444 --> 34:59.680
nothing on this Earth could
keep me from going after them.

35:15.597 --> 35:17.797
I didn't know
you still had this.

35:17.832 --> 35:19.733
It's the last one,
right?

35:19.767 --> 35:22.936
"Deathly Hallows." Yes.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.539
We were halfway through it
when the attack happened.

35:25.573 --> 35:27.040
I figured
I'd hang on to it.

35:27.075 --> 35:29.143
We could finish it
when we get him back.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.879
He was a huge fan.

35:31.913 --> 35:35.015
He came to me one time and told
me he wished he was nearsighted

35:35.049 --> 35:37.084
so that he could have glasses
like Harry.

35:40.021 --> 35:41.622
Yeah.

35:41.656 --> 35:43.824
I think we both knew
that he was getting a bit old

35:43.858 --> 35:46.593
for his dad
to be reading him stories.

35:47.316 --> 35:51.286
We made an exception
for Harry.

35:51.321 --> 35:54.623
Think he'll be all right
when we get him back?

35:54.658 --> 35:56.325
Yeah, I do.

35:59.430 --> 36:02.265
Hey, dad...

36:02.300 --> 36:04.267
I have a feeling

36:04.301 --> 36:08.705
that Ben might be
a little different now.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.974
I mean, you've seen him.

36:13.044 --> 36:18.248
Well, I've seen him
with a harness on.

36:18.283 --> 36:20.184
I mean,
you heard what Harris said.

36:20.218 --> 36:23.386
They're pumping drugs and God
knows what else into those kids.

36:23.420 --> 36:24.954
Yeah, yeah.

36:24.988 --> 36:26.622
After we get it off of him,
I'm sure he's gonna --

36:26.656 --> 36:28.690
I-I hope so.

36:28.724 --> 36:32.160
But when he took Karen,

36:32.195 --> 36:36.764
he was staring at me, and it
wasn't our Ben staring back.

36:41.536 --> 36:43.370
Dad.

36:45.473 --> 36:46.640
I know my son.

36:46.674 --> 36:49.643
He's stronger
than you think.

36:51.346 --> 36:53.546
He's gonna be fine.

36:55.516 --> 36:58.351
Don't forget to eat,
huh?

37:06.226 --> 37:07.693
The good news is

37:07.728 --> 37:10.028
the radio transmissions
aren't very strong.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.530
Otherwise, our Skitter would
have signaled his friends,

37:12.565 --> 37:14.532
and they would have
attacked us already.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.134
That is good news.

37:16.168 --> 37:19.504
Aside from that, just a quiet
day at the shop, huh?

37:19.538 --> 37:21.606
Yeah, other than that.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.509
Oh, Matt got a job.

37:23.543 --> 37:24.677
<i>A job?</i>

37:24.711 --> 37:27.447
Uncle Scott's assistant.

37:27.481 --> 37:29.382
That's perfect.

37:29.417 --> 37:33.153
He's been needing
something to do.

37:33.188 --> 37:34.455
I know.

37:34.489 --> 37:37.157
He really misses you
when you're not here.

37:37.192 --> 37:39.393
We all do.

37:42.330 --> 37:43.764
Dinnertime.

37:43.798 --> 37:45.332
What are you doing?

37:45.366 --> 37:47.500
Right now?
I'm starving.

37:47.535 --> 37:49.702
Don't you dare
put weight on that leg.

37:49.736 --> 37:51.403
Unh-unh-unh.
I'm gonna get you a crutch.

37:51.438 --> 37:53.438
I'll meet up
with you later.

37:53.473 --> 37:54.606
Okay.

37:56.242 --> 37:58.209
What are you thinking?

38:00.680 --> 38:01.747
Hey.

38:01.781 --> 38:04.282
I hear
you're scouting pharmacies.

38:04.317 --> 38:05.784
Word travels fast.

38:05.818 --> 38:08.053
Well, everything within a
20-mile radius is picked clean.

38:08.087 --> 38:10.088
Then I'll go 30.

38:10.123 --> 38:12.858
There's, uh,
there's another option.

38:12.892 --> 38:14.626
Hey, dad, check this out.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.095
Is that real bread?

38:16.129 --> 38:18.564
I haven't tasted
fresh-baked bread in months.

38:18.598 --> 38:21.500
Yeah, it's a farewell gift
from Pope.

38:21.534 --> 38:24.804
He's a liar and a deserter,
but the son of a bitch can cook.

38:24.838 --> 38:27.506
Come on. Dad.

38:27.540 --> 38:30.876
It smells good.
Hey, I heard you got a job.

38:32.245 --> 38:34.647
Dear God,
we thank you for this meal

38:34.681 --> 38:36.715
and for this safe place
we live in.

38:36.750 --> 38:40.486
We know not everyone
is as lucky as we are tonight.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.154
Really think we're lucky?

38:42.189 --> 38:44.223
Yeah, I think
we can still appreciate

38:44.258 --> 38:47.026
what we have in our life,
even now.

38:55.671 --> 38:58.138
I'm thankful
for the motorcycles

38:58.173 --> 38:59.306
and the chance we have

38:59.340 --> 39:01.441
of bringing back
the people we love.

39:01.476 --> 39:06.079
And I'm grateful
we found each other

39:06.113 --> 39:09.482
so we don't have to
go through these times alone.

39:09.516 --> 39:12.017
Well, I'm grateful
for this bread,

39:12.052 --> 39:14.086
even if it did
come from Pope.

39:14.120 --> 39:17.189
How about it, Dai?
Worth a trip to the chow line?

39:17.223 --> 39:19.124
Yeah, it was.

39:19.159 --> 39:21.827
Dai is high
as a freaking kite.

39:21.861 --> 39:23.562
He is loving this bread.

39:25.632 --> 39:29.269
Dai speaks about himself
in the third person now?

39:29.303 --> 39:31.371
Yes, Dai does.

39:31.405 --> 39:34.207
Did you get
some of that bread, captain?

39:34.242 --> 39:35.709
I will.

39:35.743 --> 39:37.511
Oh, hey.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.020
Not bad.

39:51.190 --> 39:54.893
You should
say something again.

40:04.670 --> 40:09.574
Heavenly father,
for everything you've given us

40:09.608 --> 40:13.644
and especially for our
connection to each other...

40:13.678 --> 40:16.548
May we be truly thankful.

40:16.582 --> 40:19.817
In the name of the father,
of the son,

40:19.852 --> 40:23.522
and of the holy spirit,
amen.

40:23.556 --> 40:26.191
Amen.

40:26.226 --> 40:27.493
Amen.
