where he left off.

00:15.306 --> 00:18.100
REPORTER [ON TV]: Their attacker,
a white male, 24 to 30 years of age.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.060
-Not a good picture.
-Shape-shifter?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.772
DEAN: Every culture has a shape-shifter.
-Something that looks like anyone?

00:23.940 --> 00:26.608
Freeze. Stay on your knees.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.319
-He's been held on suspicion of murder.
-Murder?

00:33.074 --> 00:35.993
WOMAN: We're here downtown in front
of the City Bank of Milwaukee...

00:36.202 --> 00:39.371
...and though a short exchange
of gunfire occurred minutes ago...

00:39.539 --> 00:41.707
...police and SWAT teams
maintain position...

00:41.916 --> 00:44.793
...as we enter the third hour
of this intense standoff.

00:45.003 --> 00:49.089
Authorities estimate as many as 10
hostages are being held inside the bank.

of the suspects or--

-Something's happening.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.850

01:32.675 --> 01:36.678
So, what's it like, being an FBI guy?

01:36.846 --> 01:39.723
Well, it's dangerous.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.266
Yeah.

01:41.684 --> 01:45.854
And the secrets we gotta keep.
Oh, God, the secrets.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.191
But mostly, it's lonely.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.112
-I so know what you mean.
-Yeah.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.573
Helena was our head buyer. She--

01:57.033 --> 02:00.244
She was family, you know?
She said it herself.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.123
Every Christmas party she said
we were the only family she had.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.625
There were no signs
that she'd do this?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.377
No, I still can't believe it, even now.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.756
That night, Helena came back
to the store after closing.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.259
Cleaned out all the display cases
and the safe.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.721
Edgar, our night watchman,
he caught her in the act.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.474
He didn't know what to do.
He'd known her for years.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.477
He called me at home.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.230
And that's when she took his gun?

02:28.398 --> 02:31.275
She shot him in the face.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.611
I heard him die...

02:34.863 --> 02:36.071
...over the phone.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.157
Any idea what
her motive could've been?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.284
What motive? It makes no sense.

02:40.952 --> 02:46.081
Why steal all those diamonds, jewelry,
then what, just dump it somewhere?

02:46.249 --> 02:49.418
Just hide it and then go home and--

02:49.627 --> 02:51.003
She killed herself?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.423
The cops said she dropped a hairdryer
in the bath and fried herself.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.425
They should know, right?

02:57.260 --> 02:58.677
Yeah.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.139
Well, thanks, Frannie.
Think that's all I need.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.767
Really? I mean, because I've got more.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.605
You know, if you wanted to
interview me...

03:09.772 --> 03:12.608
...sometime, in private?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.778
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

03:17.405 --> 03:22.201
You're a true patriot, you really are.
Why don't you write your number down?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.788
So you never saw the security camera
footage yourself, then.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.917
The police, they took all the tapes,
first thing.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.168
Of course they did.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.176
Look at your file, this is it.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.553
-Frigging cops.
-They're just doing their job.

03:41.721 --> 03:45.307
No, they're doing our job.
Only they don't know it, so they suck at it.

03:45.516 --> 03:49.311
-Talk to me about this bank.
-Milwaukee National Trust.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.189
-It was hit a month ago.
-Same M.O. as the jewelry store?

03:52.357 --> 03:55.734
Inside job, long-time employee.
The never-in-a-million-years type.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.655
Dude robs the bank, then goes home
and supposedly commits suicide.

03:59.822 --> 04:03.700
DEAN: Reznick was the guard on duty?
-He was beaten unconscious...

04:03.868 --> 04:06.161
-...by the teller who heisted the place.
-God.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.663
Yeah.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.207
Mr. Reznick?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.501
Ronald Reznick?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.838
Son of a--

04:23.346 --> 04:26.223
FBI, Mr. Reznick.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.183
Let me see the badge.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.566
Already gave my statement
to the police.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.194
Ronald, just some things
about your statement.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.071
We want some clarification on it.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.490
-You read it?
-Sure did.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.535
-Come to listen to what I gotta say?
-That's why we're here.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.708
Well, come on in.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.129
None of the cops ever called me back.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.589
Not after I told them
what was really going on.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.217
They all thought I was crazy.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.595
First off, Juan Morales never robbed
the Milwaukee National Trust.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.514
That I guarantee.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.308
Me and Juan were friends.

05:09.559 --> 05:13.103
He used to come back to the bank on
my night shifts and we'd play cards.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.524
So you let him into the bank that night.
After hours.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.110
The thing I let into the bank...

05:20.737 --> 05:22.321
...wasn't Juan.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.408
I mean it had his face,
but it wasn't his face.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.577
Every detail was perfect
but too perfect.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.539
Like if a doll maker made it,
like, if I was talking to a big Juan doll.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.958
-A "Juan doll"?
-Look.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.420
This wasn't the only time.
There was this jewelry store too.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.799
And the cops and you guys, I mean,
you just won't see it.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.427
Both crimes were pulled
by the same thing.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.929
And what's that, Mr. Reznick?

05:50.641 --> 05:53.435
Chinese been working on them
and the Russians before that.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.104
Part man, part machine.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.982
Like the Terminator but the kind
that can change itself.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.776
Make itself look like others.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.277
-Like from T2.
-Exactly.

06:02.487 --> 06:07.449
See, not just a robot.
More of a "mandroid."

06:07.617 --> 06:09.117
A mandroid?

06:09.285 --> 06:12.162
What makes you so sure about this,
Ronald?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.087
See, I made copies
of all the security tapes.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.340
I knew once the cops got them
they'd be buried. Here.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.134
Now watch.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.638
Watch.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.140
Watch him, watch, watch.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.893
See? Look, there it is.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.230
You see, he's got the laser eyes.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.824
Cops said it was
some kind of reflected light.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.827
Some kind of "camera flare." Okay?

06:52.161 --> 06:53.995
Ain't no damn camera flare.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.373
They say I'm a post-trauma case.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.167
So what? Bank goes and fires me?
It don't matter.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.671
The mandroid is still out there.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.008
The law won't hunt this thing down...

07:07.218 --> 07:08.844
...I'll do it myself.

07:09.011 --> 07:13.014
You see, this thing, it kills the real person.
Makes it look like a suicide.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.016
Then it, like, morphs into the person.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.186
Cases the job for a while till it knows
the take is fat...

07:18.354 --> 07:20.230
...then finds its opening.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.733
These robberies, they're grouped
together. So I figure...

07:23.943 --> 07:26.194
...the mandroid is holed up
in the middle.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.280
Underground maybe. I don't know.

07:28.531 --> 07:33.076
Maybe that's where it recharges
its mandroid batteries.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.203
Okay.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.957
I want you to listen very carefully.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.545
Because I'm about to tell you
the gods' honest truth about all of this.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.300
There's no such thing as mandroids.

07:50.219 --> 07:53.263
There's nothing evil or inhuman going on
out there. Just people.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.390
Nothing else, you understand?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.563
-The laser eyes--
-Just a camera flare.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.775
I know you don't wanna believe it, but
your friend robbed the bank and that's it.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.905
Get out of my house!

08:10.448 --> 08:12.616
-Now.
-Sure.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.992
First things first.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.207
Man, that has got to be the kicker,
straight up.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.626
You tell that poor son of a bitch that--

08:22.793 --> 08:25.837
What did you say?
Remand the tapes that he copied?

08:26.088 --> 08:29.758
Classified evidence of an ongoing
investigation? That's messed up.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.344
What, are you pissed at me?

08:32.511 --> 08:35.597
I think it's creepy
how good of a fed you are.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.100
We could've thrown the guy a bone.
He did some pretty good legwork.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.938
-Mandroid?
-Except for the mandroid part.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.024
I liked him.
He's not that different from us.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.485
-People think we're crazy.
-He's not a hunter.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.612
He's a guy who
stumbled onto something.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.365
If he went up against this,
he'd get torn apart.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.951
Better to stay in the dark
and stay alive.

Yeah, I guess.

09:02.458 --> 09:06.336

Same retinal reaction to video.

Eyes flare at the camera.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.466
-I hate those frigging things.
-You think I don't?

09:12.009 --> 09:15.053
One didn't turn into you
and frame you for murder.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.808
Look, if this shifter's anything
like the one in Missouri--

09:19.976 --> 09:21.268
Then Ronald's right.

09:24.146 --> 09:27.399
They like to lair up underground.
Preferably the sewer.

09:27.650 --> 09:32.988
All the robberies are connected
so far to the sewer main layout.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.286
There's one more bank lined up
on that sewer main.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.882
DEAN:
No, this is a glitch in the overall grid.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.594
Just wanna make sure the branch
monitors are kosher.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.805
-Better to be safe than sorry.
-That's the plan.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.352
Alrighty.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.355
No, we'll be in and out before
you know it. A routine check.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.946
-I like him. He says okey-dokey.
-What if he's the shifter?

10:16.532 --> 10:20.243
Then we follow him home and put a
silver bullet through his chest plate.

10:24.206 --> 10:27.208
Okay. Got any popcorn?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.055
Well, looks like Mr. Okey-dokey...

10:40.264 --> 10:42.432
...is okey-dokey.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.061

Dean.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.563
We don't even know it's here.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.400
Maybe we should just go on back
to the sewers and--

-They're dangerous and expertly trained.
-We can't risk all those people.
