away the feeling

from my hands and my feet

there was a good chance

no money in our bank account,

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.029
but never once
did she look at me

01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:21.629
and say stop pursuing my dream.

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:23.459
I saw his humor,

and the year
before we got married,

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.299
she put a timeframe on me
to propose to her.

"Hey, Sam, come here.

show you how much I love you

"Oh, my God, this is it."

I drive a crappy car.

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.359

it's impossible.

let people cut you off

want to mess up your car.
