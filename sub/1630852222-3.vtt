WEBVTT

03:19.280 --> 03:20.800
Ah.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.280
All right!

03:30.960 --> 03:33.880
So, tell us what brings you
here today, Christopher?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.360
What brings me here today? Erm...

03:37.520 --> 03:39.240
Well...

03:40.920 --> 03:43.360
Um...anyone, really.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
Er...

03:44.840 --> 03:48.080
Er, I... I like to read,
which I suppose makes sense.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.960
I'm a librarian.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.600
So, anyone interested in books,
erm, I suppose.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.760
Er, I like films.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.440
'I love going to the cinema.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.800
I like old films especially.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.920
I like, er, romantic films,
um... French films.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.960
Oh, I love old Westerns.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.120
I used to watch those
with my grandfather.'

04:08.160 --> 04:10.360
'The older ones.
Er, Some Like It Hot.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.360
Er, The Golden Age.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.960
Oh, though, I do like...
Oh, what's he called?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.600
Gerard Depardieu.

04:16.640 --> 04:20.320
Erm, yeah, there's something
about him I find quite...'

04:20.360 --> 04:22.400
interesting.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.360
'John Wayne films er...'

04:25.080 --> 04:27.040
I love that film High Noon.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.080
Anything with Gary Cooper in it.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.360
'If you could just tell us
a bit more about who you are...

04:36.400 --> 04:38.240
as a person.'

04:38.280 --> 04:40.280
'Who I am?'

04:40.320 --> 04:44.040
'Yeah, just what sort of person
do you think you are deep down?'

04:48.000 --> 04:50.560
Deep down.
That's quite tricky, isn't it?

04:53.240 --> 04:54.960
'Uh...

04:55.760 --> 04:58.280
Sorry.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.840
Um...

05:00.720 --> 05:02.640
I sup... I'm...'

05:06.240 --> 05:08.000
'Take your time.'

05:09.320 --> 05:11.400
I...um...

05:14.440 --> 05:16.680
Sorry. I didn't expect you
to ask me that.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.600
That's OK.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.600
'He was often
very proud, very stubborn.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.520
Smart boy in many ways.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.520
Could've gone to university.'

05:44.560 --> 05:47.240
But he just wasn't motivated
in that way.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.160
Hard working
but not always productive,

05:51.200 --> 05:53.080
if you know what I mean.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.920
And he didn't want to leave
his mother was the other thing.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.640
Or his brother.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.800
So, he was close to his mum?
And his brother - was it "David"?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.000
Yes.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.600
Yes, it was David.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.240
What about his erm...

06:08.280 --> 06:11.680
relationship with the victims,
the er... Wycherleys?

06:11.720 --> 06:15.560
I only met the Wycherleys once,
at the wedding.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.080
Well, the mother, anyway.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.360
The father
I don't remember that much.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.080
But Chris never really spoke to me
about that kind of thing.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.520
And the truth is he and I
never spoke much about anything.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.760
After he and Susan got married...

06:31.720 --> 06:35.720
..they both just disappeared
into their own world.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.200
How do you mean?

06:37.240 --> 06:40.240
Well, neither of them
are built for THIS one, are they?

06:42.160 --> 06:45.560
If you told me that they'd beamed
their way in on little spaceships,

06:45.600 --> 06:47.800
I'd have half a mind to believe you.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
Oh, don't tell me
I'm onto something.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.560
Are they aliens?

06:54.840 --> 06:57.040
So, this erm...

06:57.080 --> 06:59.440
this might seem like
a stupid question,

06:59.480 --> 07:02.320
but can I ask you
about the word "fragile"?

07:05.200 --> 07:09.000
Chris, he often refers to Susan
as "fragile" in his...

07:09.040 --> 07:12.120
in his emails, in...
in conversation.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.400
Yes.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.960
Yes, he does.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.840
Just wondering what that's about,
I guess.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.200
If you want to understand
my step-son, you should know

07:28.240 --> 07:31.080
that he has always found himself
someone like that.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.200
Someone "fragile", if you like.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.800
Whether it be his mother
or his brother.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.120
It's not my story to tell,
I'm afraid.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.160
But they both died
before their time...

07:47.720 --> 07:49.560
..put it that way.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.680
And Chris took it very, very hard.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.760
Especially when David went.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.680
I'd never seen a man
weep like that before.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.360
Quite harrowing, actually.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.200
It's one of the only times
I ever held him.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.240
He's a lot bigger than me
but, my goodness, did he feel small.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.200
But that's Chris, you see.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.800
He's always trying
to save someone...

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
..and he never manages to do it.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.080
Would you like me
to make you a cup of tea?

08:53.200 --> 08:56.640
No, thanks.
I'll be all right in a minute.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.640
OK.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.080
Let me know if you change your mind.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.960
Yes, please, actually.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.280
Two sugars, please.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.120
Need a bit of a pick-me-up.
Coming right up!

09:37.840 --> 09:40.320
'Dear Gerard Depardieu,

09:40.360 --> 09:43.120
my husband and I are huge fans
of your work,

09:43.160 --> 09:45.440
particularly the dramas,

09:45.480 --> 09:48.960
though we also think
you're an excellent comedic actor.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.760
I am writing to ask you most humbly
for a signed photograph.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.120
I would love to give this
to my husband, Chris,

09:56.160 --> 09:59.240
to lift his spirits,
as he has recently been bereaved.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.720
He tragically lost his dear brother
David several months ago

10:03.760 --> 10:06.400
and has been inconsolable
ever since.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.440
I know that a message and a gift
from you would give him strength.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.480
We live in England
but we love France.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.880
We think you live in the most
romantic country in the world.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.000
Un grand merci in advance,
Mr Depardieu.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.920
Yours faithfully, Susan Edwards.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.600
Susan's at her parents' house
in Mansfield - without Chris.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.120
He's back in London.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.960
Her mother, Patricia Wycherley -
possible drink problem.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.440
Her father, William,
was sexually abusive towards Susan.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.400
Allegedly.
Let's assume it's true.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.400
Patricia shoots her husband.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.040
She's pissed. Some kind of row.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.560
Bang, bang. First question -
why has Patricia got a gun?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.120
Patricia drops the gun.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.640
Susan picks it up.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.560
Patricia says horrible things
to Susan, winds her up -

10:59.600 --> 11:01.920
Bang, bang again.
Whoops, Mum's dead too.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.600
She cannelloni's her parents
in a blanket and leaves them
under the bed for a week.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.440
Correct, sir. Then she gets
the coach back down to London,

11:09.480 --> 11:11.920
tells her husband
her parents are off to Blackpool,

11:11.960 --> 11:13.760
so they need to house-sit.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.200
They head back up to Mansfield.
Fish supper.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.080
Susan can't take it any more.
Spills the beans.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.160
Husband digs a massive hole,
buries both bodies in the garden.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.000
And we think
that's a load of old...?

11:25.040 --> 11:26.480
Bullshit!
Good.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.800
So, first task
is to prove that it's rubbish.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.760
Second task is to work out
what actually happened.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.400
Was it premeditated?
Are we looking at joint enterprise?

11:34.440 --> 11:36.840
If so, how do we convince the CPS?

11:36.880 --> 11:41.960
'For the record,
I'm placing evidence
from Catalogue A on the table.'

11:42.960 --> 11:44.520
Gary Cooper.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.040
President Eisenhower.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.640
John Wayne.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.200
Kirk Douglas.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.160
Sir Winston Churchill.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.840
Charles de Gaulle.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.400
Personal correspondence
with the actor Gerard Depardieu.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.400
Oh, yes, Gerard.
Be very careful with those, please.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.480
Are you friends with him,
Mr Edwards?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.760
Not exactly.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.680
Susan wrote to him once
and we just stayed in touch.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.440
All right.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.960
These are all glamorous men,
aren't they?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.960
Heroic men.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.840
How do YOU fit into that?

12:18.880 --> 12:21.400
This is all you brought back
with you from France.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.520
It's all you've got left, in't it?

12:23.560 --> 12:25.040
No money in the bank.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.840
No other assets to speak of.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.840
Half of it bought behind your back

12:28.880 --> 12:31.120
with credit cards
you had to work to pay off.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.920
She was using money you had earned
to buy tat.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.800
Look...

12:38.080 --> 12:41.640
..this may not be to your taste,
but it is not tat.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.880
Some of these are highly
sought-after and very rare.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
Actually, Susan has immaculate taste
when it comes to things like this.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
700 quid.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.040
Don't know what you paid for it,
but we've had it appraised at 700.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.680
It is, I'm afraid,
what we call in the business...

13:02.720 --> 13:05.240
a big old pile of useless tat.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.640
You're lying.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.240
I can do that?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.960
It's all right, love.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.160
We've, er...
We've got some, have we?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.040
In the spice drawer.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.480
Oh! Dang it.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.880
The top's come off!
They've gone everywhere.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.320
No, no, no, you finish your eggs
in peace.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.320
It's my mess.
Dustpan's under the sink!

14:03.960 --> 14:05.440
You all right?

14:06.280 --> 14:10.240
No, er... They've scurried into
all the nooks and corners.

14:10.280 --> 14:14.120
I need the hoover.
Oh, no. I can do that.
It's a bit of a jumble.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.880
I'm not a baby, Susan.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.920
And it's hardly a jumble.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.640
What are these?

14:29.080 --> 14:32.680
This is a lot of money, Susan.
It's an investment. We can sell it.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.840
Picture Show Magazine, £400.
It's signed by Gary Cooper!

14:36.880 --> 14:39.240
That's not the point!
We don't have this money!

14:39.280 --> 14:42.360
We've never had this money.
I don't earn enough.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.600
I was gonna tell you about that one.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.240
"Dear Mr Wycherley..."
This is to your father.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.120
Look, I can explain.
"As you are about to turn 100,

14:51.160 --> 14:53.640
we at the Department
for Work and Pensions

14:53.680 --> 14:56.080
would like to visit you
at the above address

14:56.120 --> 14:58.560
to conduct an in-person interview"!

14:58.600 --> 15:00.400
But it...it's OK.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.040
How is it OK? We've told 'em he's
living with us. He isn't, is he?

15:04.080 --> 15:06.400
No, but I wrote to them
and asked them to delay.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.320
It doesn't matter how long we wait.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.880
Your father's never gonna
attend this interview, is he?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.240
I know that.
What did you think would happen?

15:13.280 --> 15:16.320
Hey? Why did you hide
this letter from me?

15:18.200 --> 15:21.840
'It's a compulsion.
It's her way of dealing
with things that er...

15:21.880 --> 15:24.440
It's like she's trying
to buy back the happiness

15:24.480 --> 15:26.240
that her parents
stole away from her.'

15:26.280 --> 15:29.040
But that was when she was a child -
three decades earlier.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.720
She's a grown woman now.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.040
I assume you're trying
to goad me into something

15:33.080 --> 15:34.920
by deliberately oversimplifying,

15:34.960 --> 15:37.440
but it's clear that these
experiences are not...

15:37.480 --> 15:39.320
You can't just shake them off.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.240
And besides, William and Patricia

15:43.280 --> 15:45.200
never stopped being horrible to her.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.920
They never stopped trying to take

15:46.960 --> 15:48.840
every chance of happiness
away from her.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.960
You must have hated them.
No, I tried not to.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.280
This was very difficult.
I tried not to get involved -

15:53.320 --> 15:55.560
So, what did they do
to "steal her happiness"?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.440
Well, they were
abusive to her verbally,

15:57.480 --> 15:59.480
they constantly
undermined her confidence

15:59.520 --> 16:02.080
and on one occasion,
they literally stole from her.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.240
What I mean is, they were -
They stole from her?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.680
In a way, yes,
that's just a small example,

16:07.720 --> 16:09.440
but what I mean is they were...

16:09.480 --> 16:11.480
in general, they...

16:11.520 --> 16:13.480
they were not at all nice to her.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.360
What did they steal from her, Chris?
Oh, look, "steal"...

16:16.400 --> 16:18.280
"stole", that's an exaggeration.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.040
What I mean is Susan...

16:20.080 --> 16:22.440
This is the power they had over her.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.360
She gave it to them
quite willingly as a gift.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.320
Because she wanted them to like her.
Which I never understood -

16:29.360 --> 16:31.160
A gift of what?
Well, money, essentially.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.120
Well, when was this?
Oh, I can't remember.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.840
It was that long ago.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.200
Maybe the late...'80s.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.120
And it wasn't money as such,
it was that,

16:40.160 --> 16:42.720
look, they had
shared ownership in a house.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.440
Susan and I were married now
so we moved into my flat,

16:46.480 --> 16:50.040
and they -
the...the Wycherleys - they...

16:50.760 --> 16:52.880
..well, they thought
it'd be better if...

16:52.920 --> 16:55.840
If Susan just handed over
her share to them?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.360
Oh...

17:04.760 --> 17:07.160
'Susan had helped them
buy it some years previously,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.000
so her name was on the deeds.'

17:09.040 --> 17:11.480
'She helped them buy it?'
'Yes, they...'

17:11.520 --> 17:12.640
Hi.

17:12.680 --> 17:16.880
'She'd received an inheritance
from her grandfather...

17:16.920 --> 17:18.400
on her mother's side.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.240
He was the one who got her into
all the old Western movies.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.880
He was a... He was a war hero,

17:22.920 --> 17:26.480
and somewhat confusingly about
the same age as William, her dad.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.560
William hated him, of course, but
William seemed to hate everyone.'

17:29.600 --> 17:31.560
William.
Good to see you.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.840
Ah, likewise. Likewise, yeah.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.560
Go on through.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.880
Oh.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.600
'And so, did her mum not inherit
anything herself, then?'

17:43.640 --> 17:45.440
'No. That was the tricky thing.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.480
I suppose, because of
the animosity with William,

17:48.520 --> 17:51.600
her father didn't want William
to get his hands on it,

17:51.640 --> 17:54.160
so he just left it all to Susan.'

18:06.760 --> 18:10.400
Chris, perhaps you could
take William off for a port.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.520
We don't have any port.
Or something.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.680
You know...leave us girls
to have a little catch-up.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.680
What's your poison, William?

18:29.720 --> 18:31.640
My wife.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.280
You have no idea how awful it is.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.000
My life shouldn't have been
like this, Susan.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.840
I used to have friends.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.960
Used to laugh.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.840
Oh, Mum. It's not so bad.
You've still got me.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.200
You've no fucking idea, Susan.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.280
You've escaped.
I'm stuck with him.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.480
I'm sorry.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.480
No, I'm sorry, Susan.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.480
I'm not myself.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.480
How's your organ?
Broken.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.240
Patricia hammering away on it
with her fat fingers.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.880
I'm going for a pee.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.160
Do you want anything while I'm up?
Again?

19:33.520 --> 19:37.920
You've got the bladder of a mouse.
A lady mouse.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.720
That was MY money.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.280
He was my father, Susan!

19:45.320 --> 19:48.840
Oh, you can be a thoughtless
little bitch sometimes.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.240
I'm sorry, Susan.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.280
I never mean to hurt you.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.400
You know that, don't you?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.720
Will you consider it?

20:01.760 --> 20:04.400
Give your poor old mother
a bit of peace?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.360
Just consider it a loan.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.480
That's all it is.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.560
A simple loan.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.480
'So, she signs it over?'
'Yes.'

20:18.520 --> 20:20.160
'And what happens to the house?'

20:20.200 --> 20:22.120
It's all too predictable,
I'm afraid.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.320
Before the ink is dry
on the transfer deed,

20:24.360 --> 20:27.400
they sell the house - for a very
healthy profit I might add -

20:27.440 --> 20:29.520
and they sod off up to Mansfield.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.040
To Mansfield?
Yes.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.040
Gosh, I can see how that
might have exercised you.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.360
Well, no, I'm not...
I... I wasn't exercised.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.360
I was more regretful, I suppose.
But one tries to rise above it.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.840
Please don't be angry with me -
How can you be so stupid?!

20:44.880 --> 20:47.360
'It's your money! It's our money!'

20:47.400 --> 20:49.040
And you just let 'em take it

20:49.080 --> 20:52.120
like they've taken every other
bloody thing from you!

20:52.160 --> 20:53.920
They promised they wouldn't sell it.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.760
Their promises are worth nothing!
Of course, they're gonna sell it.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.280
They're liars.
The whole lot of you are liars!

21:01.320 --> 21:03.760
Why can't you ever learn, Susan?

21:06.640 --> 21:10.200
I tell you what. Why don't
we do something else for a bit?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.520
We could play I Spy. Erm...

21:12.560 --> 21:14.520
There's about five things
in this room.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.640
Or we could play cards.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.320
I don't have any cards.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.240
Or we could chat, you know.

21:20.280 --> 21:24.160
I guess, the point is to keep
your mind off things for a bit
so it's not gonna...

21:24.200 --> 21:26.640
What about YOUR life?
Er... Er, yeah.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.280
Yeah, er...

21:29.320 --> 21:31.960
Or we could play that game
where it's like erm...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.920
the first letter is the last
letter of the word before -

21:34.960 --> 21:36.440
What's your father like?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.320
Er... Hmm.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.520
My dad erm...

21:44.320 --> 21:46.520
My dad wasn't around much.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.040
Which is kind of a cliche,
I guess, but it's true.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.120
What about your mum?
I love my mum. She's amazing.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.680
And a wife?

21:57.720 --> 22:00.040
I've...got a girlfriend.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.080
And you know what, actually, erm...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.360
..last night, on my way home,
I was...

22:08.400 --> 22:11.960
I was thinking about
the way you talk about Chris.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.760
I hope she talks about me that way.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.520
Like how you stick up for him
and stuff.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.240
See, I don't know, erm...
I don't know.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.080
That's real, isn't it?

22:33.880 --> 22:35.880
You really love him.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.200
Sorry.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.720
'She didn't step up
to the plate like you'd hoped.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.880
You wanted her
to stand up for herself
but she's refused to change.'

22:50.920 --> 22:53.520
No. She wanted to.
She tried to. But she couldn't.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.800
So, it should have been YOU
stepping up to the plate?

22:55.840 --> 22:58.160
I couldn't know
what the Wycherleys were up to -

22:58.200 --> 23:01.280
You were watching telly with the man
who'd sexually abused your wife

23:01.320 --> 23:03.040
while her mother
stole her inheritance.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.440
That is unfairly reductive.
And on that night,

23:05.480 --> 23:07.280
when the Wycherleys
were shot and killed,

23:07.320 --> 23:09.360
you did exactly the same thing,
didn't you?

23:09.400 --> 23:12.480
You abandoned Susan to her parents.
No, I did not.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.440
You let her go alone
up to Mansfield

23:15.480 --> 23:18.480
to visit the two people
she hated most in the world.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.600
And look what happened to her.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.200
Unless that is when you see it.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.120
That Susan is never gonna change.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.920
That she can't suddenly
start standing up for herself.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.400
And that's when you realise
that you have to.

23:37.840 --> 23:41.400
I was not in Mansfield the weekend
the Wycherleys were killed.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.600
I wish I was. I might have been able
to prevent this from happening.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.320
But I was in Dagenham.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.440
Here we go.

24:13.440 --> 24:17.600
For the record,
I'm showing the suspect item PW-56.

24:29.040 --> 24:32.000
Paid another visit
to your step-mother today, Chris.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.480
And, erm...she lent us
this box of photos.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.720
Is that your mother-in-law -
Patricia?

24:43.760 --> 24:45.160
Yes.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.440
Where's William?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.640
He... He didn't come.

24:56.360 --> 25:01.080
He didn't approve of me marrying
his daughter...for some reason.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.560
And, er, did that... Did that hurt?
Not really.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.360
Is that your mum - Ange?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.600
Yes.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.200
And is that your brother - David?
Mm, yes.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.400
So um...

25:29.440 --> 25:33.480
Emma and I had a chat and we don't
wanna put you through something

25:33.520 --> 25:35.720
which is obviously...very painful,

25:35.760 --> 25:39.200
but the feeling is,
is that this erm...

25:39.240 --> 25:41.440
history, if you like,

25:41.480 --> 25:43.360
it may be relevant to the case.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.200
So do you mind if we ask you
a couple more questions?

25:49.720 --> 25:51.640
Look, Chris, my dad's a drinker,

25:51.680 --> 25:54.920
so I've got "fragile"
in the family as well.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.680
And...don't get me wrong,
I love my dad.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.040
But, by God, is he exhausting.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.520
Every time the phone rings,

26:05.560 --> 26:07.520
I know it's gonna be
some kind of drama.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.720
But do you know what makes me
angrier than anything else?

26:12.520 --> 26:15.920
Watching my mum pour all her energy
into worrying.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.480
They're not even together any more

26:19.520 --> 26:21.840
and yet still
every decision she makes

26:21.880 --> 26:24.040
revolves around him
and his drinking.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.560
And I've told her a million times...

26:29.120 --> 26:31.080
..let it go.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.560
It's not worth it.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.080
Because some people are beyond help,
aren't they, really?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.160
Let's face it.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.280
Stop trying to help people
who can't be helped.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.720
Look where it's got you both.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.680
I don't agree with you.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.840
I don't agree that
anyone's beyond help.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.040
Nobody's beyond help in this world.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.240
That's the whole point
of this world.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.040
Not my mother...

27:17.080 --> 27:19.600
not David and certainly not Susan.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.320
I wasn't trying to save my mother
or save my brother.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.400
I was trying to love them.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.960
And that's all I've ever done
with Susan, is love her.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.200
But how will she explain to a jury
that she cleared out

27:38.240 --> 27:41.200
her parents' bank account
the day after they were shot dead?

27:41.240 --> 27:43.280
No-one's gonna buy she was provoked.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.520
She's going down
for double murder, Chris,

27:45.560 --> 27:48.240
and the fact that you love her
is not gonna change anything.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.160
She didn't shoot them both.
She couldn't have -

27:50.200 --> 27:51.440
Yes, she could.
No, she couldn't.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.280
The nature of the bullet wounds
indicate that whoever shot William

27:54.320 --> 27:56.000
also shot -

27:56.040 --> 27:59.120
She couldn't have done it.
She's terrified of guns.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.400
What do you mean
she's terrified of guns?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.680
Oh, Susan.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.800
I know what this
is going to look like.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.480
But I have to stand up for my wife.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.640
I know she couldn't have
killed them both.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.600
I know she was terrified of guns

28:33.640 --> 28:35.680
because I used to belong
to a gun club.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.920
I used to own guns myself, in fact.
I owned two pistols.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.560
'Both of which I got rid of
long before the Wycherleys died,

28:42.600 --> 28:44.280
before the Dunblane law even,

28:44.320 --> 28:46.200
when I would've had
to turn them in, anyway.'

28:46.240 --> 28:49.120
But I dragged Susan along
to the range once or twice,

28:49.160 --> 28:54.800
and she couldn't even
bring herself to touch a gun,
much less shoot one. So I know...

28:54.840 --> 28:57.960
that she could never have killed
two people with a gun.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.360
She could never have contemplated
killing two people with a gun.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.160
That is impossible.

29:45.160 --> 29:49.360
'So, that awful weekend in May
when you were alone -

29:49.400 --> 29:51.760
you say - your parents are dead,

29:51.800 --> 29:55.200
you're up all night wondering
how to dispose of the bodies...

29:55.240 --> 29:56.760
what to do with the gun,

29:56.800 --> 29:58.480
sleeping in that house

29:58.520 --> 30:00.800
and then going
and opening that bank account.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.960
That's a lot for anyone
to go through, Susan.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.920
And for someone "fragile" like you.'

30:04.960 --> 30:07.000
'Can you get to the point, please?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.520
My client is pretty exhausted
already from waiting all day,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.920
so I think the least you could do
is to be concise.'

30:11.960 --> 30:15.120
'The point is, Susan,
we can't imagine you
going through it on your own.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.600
We think Chris helped you.
Which means we're not
asking for manslaughter.'

30:18.640 --> 30:20.920
We're recommending murder.
For both of you.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.240
No.
We think Chris was with you
that first weekend -

30:23.280 --> 30:26.840
probably the only weekend -
and you murdered them together
and then he buried them.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.440
No!
What are you basing this on?

30:28.480 --> 30:30.760
You both felt you were owed money
from that house.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.560
No...er... The house?
In Edgware.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.440
The one they "stole" from you -
to quote your husband.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.920
Let me tell you
what our report's gonna say.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.720
See if it makes sense to you.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.640
Come on, Susan.
I'm sorry, but I have to object.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.600
You, too. This way.
Where are you going?

30:44.640 --> 30:46.920
What's happening?
Shall I bring the camera, Emma?

30:46.960 --> 30:48.720
Nah.
You don't have to follow them.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.160
Where are you going!
Susan!

30:50.200 --> 30:52.280
Chop, chop.
You don't have to go with them.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.080
You can come back! Susan.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.920
No -
Grant, come on.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.200
Excuse me. Sorry. No!

31:00.240 --> 31:02.560
Where are you going? No!

31:02.600 --> 31:04.520
Susan!

31:04.560 --> 31:08.480
Good evening, you two.
You're looking fresher
than when I last saw you.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.120
Oh, stop it. Isn't she funny?

31:11.160 --> 31:13.400
Where shall I stand?

31:13.440 --> 31:15.360
Or... Or... Or shall I sit?

31:15.400 --> 31:17.360
Shall... Shall I plug in?

31:17.400 --> 31:19.960
Nah, you're all right.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.760
Ah. Come through.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.360
No, because this is silly.
Oh, hello, darlings!

31:27.400 --> 31:29.160
Don't you look lovely.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.760
Come in, come in.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.440
Hello, my girl!
Fuck you, Dad!

31:32.480 --> 31:34.560
No. I wouldn't say that
because I don't swear.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.400
William. Good to see you.
Yeah, good to see you, too.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.520
Ow, why are you squeezing my hand
so hard?

31:39.560 --> 31:43.040
Because of what you did to my wife.
That's a bit much, don't you think?

31:43.080 --> 31:45.320
This is not how it happened.
No, it didn't.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.480
It didn't happen like this!

31:53.840 --> 31:56.000
I keep telling you,
Chris wasn't there!

31:56.040 --> 31:57.800
Hello, darling.
What you doing?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.320
Mr Wycherley, excuse me, sir.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.520
Would you mind getting up?
Delighted.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.360
Unless one of you tells us, Susan,

32:04.400 --> 32:06.560
we're never gonna know
exactly what happened -

32:06.600 --> 32:08.120
whether you're all having
a nice time,

32:08.160 --> 32:09.720
or you're all having a row,
or what -

32:09.760 --> 32:13.000
but sooner or later you had them
both up here in the bedroom.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.080
Right, can you give me the...

32:17.640 --> 32:19.440
Now? OK?

32:19.480 --> 32:21.760
Actually, William and Patricia...
Yes, ma'am?

32:21.800 --> 32:25.920
This is ridiculous.
Could you get into bed and go
to sleep? That makes more sense.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.160
That's a good note.
Thank you, Officer.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.320
Patricia would probably be
sleeping quite lightly, I think,

32:32.360 --> 32:35.000
because of her back pain.
Yeah, OK.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.160
Right, all yours, Chris.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.960
Woah...sorry.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.920
No, just don't worry about that.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.680
Right, yes. Ah...

32:51.280 --> 32:53.880
We think Chris was with you
that first weekend -

32:53.920 --> 32:56.960
probably the only weekend -
and you murdered them together.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.360
Then, over the next couple of days,
he buried the bodies -

32:59.400 --> 33:01.120
No, that was the following weekend.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.440
The weekend
of the Eurovision Song Contest.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.480
Because we stayed up
to watch it on television

33:05.520 --> 33:08.080
while our neighbours went to bed,
so we could bury the bodies.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.800
I remember it was the year
that Dana International won -

33:10.840 --> 33:13.720
Dana Inter...
You never give up, do you?

33:13.760 --> 33:16.880
Chris informed us that he used
to have a couple of revolvers.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.640
.38s, as it happens.
Susan...you're within your rights
to take five to discuss this.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.920
That was a long time ago.
He got rid of them.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.960
He says you couldn't stand guns.
That's right.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.440
I was terrified -
Terrified of them. Yeah, he said.

33:27.480 --> 33:29.640
Couldn't even bring yourself
to touch one.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.080
You don't think
that's his way of telling us
- that HE did the shooting?
- No!

33:33.120 --> 33:35.320
Kind of like when he called
his step-mother... No, no!

33:35.360 --> 33:37.440
He's not confessing to anything!
Susan.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.640
- What?!
- Are you sure
you don't wanna discuss this?

33:39.680 --> 33:43.200
What difference would that make?!
I can advise you on how best to -

33:43.240 --> 33:45.360
How to what?
There's a lot being discussed -

33:45.400 --> 33:47.960
We are not murderers!
She's calling me a murderer!

33:48.000 --> 33:51.600
I don't know what he was thinking,
telling you about his guns.
That's not clever.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.680
But doesn't it just show you, like
when he called his step-mother -

33:54.720 --> 33:57.160
which he was very hurt by,
by the way she betrayed him -

33:57.200 --> 33:59.760
doesn't that just show you
he has nothing to hide?

33:59.800 --> 34:03.640
If you want to know
where the gun came from,
it was my father's, actually.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.880
And you're gonna think
this is a lie but...

34:05.920 --> 34:09.400
but he actually was fascinated
by fascist iconography and Nazis.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.360
Susan -
This is the truth! Believe me.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.520
He had a collection in a cabinet
and we got rid of them

34:13.560 --> 34:15.440
because we didn't like
having them in the house.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.720
So we got rid of everything.
You have to believe me. Please.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.160
Are you done?

34:26.200 --> 34:28.560
In truth, it no longer matters
what I believe.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.920
We're gonna stop there, Susan.
Thank you.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.960
We're going to prison.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.880
My Chris is going to prison
and I'll never see him again.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.560
You can get through this, Susan.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.720
Um, you have to stay calm.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.640
It... It's...
There's a whole trial yet, OK?

34:49.680 --> 34:52.360
You have to trust me.
When will I see Chris again?

34:52.400 --> 34:54.080
I... I...
Maybe not for a while but...

34:54.120 --> 34:55.960
I mean, if...
if the trial does happen,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.720
I'll make sure he finds
a really good lawyer and...

34:58.760 --> 35:01.160
If you do get charged
and prison does happen,

35:01.200 --> 35:02.800
for either one of you,

35:02.840 --> 35:05.440
once you get your head around it,
it's not so bad.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.240
OK? It's actually a lot more
comfortable than being in here.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.640
You just have to trust me -
I don't trust you!

35:11.680 --> 35:13.760
I don't trust anyone except Chris.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.760
Fair enough. I get it, I get it.
And I know you're upset. I just...

35:17.800 --> 35:21.080
I'm very sorry, but you
have to keep it together, OK.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.360
I get it. Honestly, I do -
You don't get it!

35:24.400 --> 35:26.640
You don't. You don't get it!
Susan, I...I...

35:26.680 --> 35:29.760
Why didn't you stop them?!
You didn't do anything!

35:30.880 --> 35:33.640
I'm sorry if you're not happy
with how I represented you,

35:33.680 --> 35:36.480
but it's a big case for me, Susan,
and I just...

35:36.520 --> 35:39.000
I... I didn't know...
I didn't know about the house.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.680
I didn't know
about the bank account.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.920
I didn't know about Chris
and his guns.

35:42.960 --> 35:46.520
You didn't tell me -
I wasn't supposed to tell you,
so why would I tell you?!

35:46.560 --> 35:48.480
Yeah, OK.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.920
Stupid Chris. What is he doing?

35:50.960 --> 35:54.040
He's been in questioning for
two days straight without support.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.040
It's tough, Susan. People break.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.840
It's so tough.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.760
Erm, OK, OK, listen.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.960
I don't normally tell anybody
about this -

36:04.000 --> 36:07.640
at least not my clients - because
I'm not really proud of it, but...

36:08.120 --> 36:11.800
..if it makes you feel any better,
I have... I've been to prison.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.720
Yeah, I know, but it's true.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.600
And, OK, it was when I was younger,
er, silly stuff.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.880
Getting into fights and so on,
but...but, look, I had my mum.

36:20.920 --> 36:24.760
And I had my girl,
the same way you have Chris.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.520
And now here I am.
That's not the same thing.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.440
What's not the same thing?

36:33.160 --> 36:35.880
It's not the same thing!

36:35.920 --> 36:39.000
Chris is the only thing I love
and I can't lose...

36:39.040 --> 36:42.040
I can't lose him. I can't.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.480
All right!

36:55.520 --> 36:58.560
All right, calm down.
You're not getting a table dance.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.840
Obviously, a lot of hard graft
has gone into this -

37:01.880 --> 37:04.280
including all you lot
behind the scenes.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.880
But I think we can all agree

37:05.920 --> 37:09.200
that DC Lancing and DC Wilkie
have done us proud.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.400
Howdy, Sheriff.
Fair fucks to you, Emma -
balls of steel.

37:12.440 --> 37:16.320
We can be pretty confident now
that the story that pair
of vampires came in with

37:16.360 --> 37:19.240
is as fairy-tale
as Father Fucking Christmas.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.800
Except Santa never killed anyone,
as far as we know.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.480
We ain't caught him yet, anyway.
But, on a serious note,

37:24.520 --> 37:27.360
the hope is
that because of our work,

37:27.400 --> 37:29.360
a double murder has been solved

37:29.400 --> 37:32.280
and two cold-hearted criminals
will be brought to justice.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.280
And that's what it's all about.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.560
That's what gets me up
in the morning....

37:37.400 --> 37:39.520
..and that's why I love this job.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.440
If the lawyers don't fuck it up.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.920
That's right, Paul.
It's all down to them
wiggy bloody penguins now.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.360
That's why they get paid
the big bucks, is it?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.160
So, anyway, good work.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.920
Let's have a few drinks,
big case but onto the next one.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.240
Come on!

37:57.280 --> 37:59.400
To justice.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.480
Right, who's got the bottle opener?

38:04.200 --> 38:06.120
Right, good work.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.400
'"Dear Chris,
thank you for the kind letter

38:10.440 --> 38:14.160
requesting a signed photograph,
which I include in this envelope.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.000
I cannot imagine the pain that
you are suffering at the moment

38:18.040 --> 38:20.560
and I wish
that I could take it away."'

38:20.600 --> 38:22.880
'Hello?'
Hiya, Dad.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.680
'Is that you, ducky?'

38:28.360 --> 38:30.000
Yeah. You all right?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.400
'Yeah, I'm all right. Are you?'

38:34.440 --> 38:36.040
Yeah.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
'This is a nice surprise.'

38:40.280 --> 38:43.440
'"In life,
there are moments of darkness.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.680
I have experienced many
in my life, too.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.800
But I know there will always be
some hope to come around the corner.

38:50.640 --> 38:54.600
My dear Chris, at times of darkness
it is natural to grieve,

38:54.640 --> 38:56.520
but you must not despair.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.480
Your beautiful brother David
is in heaven amongst the angels

39:00.520 --> 39:02.560
where there is only light,

39:02.600 --> 39:05.280
and you will see him once more
in this place.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.840
Please write to me again.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.960
I would be very happy
to be your friend.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.760
Yours sincerely, Gerard Depardieu."'

39:20.280 --> 39:22.280
I can't believe it.

39:23.240 --> 39:28.200
I can't believe that someone like
that would write to people like us.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.840
Can you?

39:29.880 --> 39:32.120
Yeah, it's definitely surprising.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.200
What an extraordinary gesture.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.360
What an extraordinary man.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.520
Yeah. Has it made you feel better?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.800
I think it has.

39:46.120 --> 39:49.120
It's made me feel like
there's some good in the world

39:49.160 --> 39:51.480
and it's important
to be reminded of that, isn't it?

39:51.520 --> 39:53.320
Yeah, definitely.

39:53.360 --> 39:57.760
Gerard Depardieu
friends with the likes of us.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.600
Can I tell you a secret?

40:04.640 --> 40:06.560
A secret?

40:09.560 --> 40:11.680
When I was a little girl...

40:11.720 --> 40:14.240
and I used to go for walks
sometimes on my own

40:14.280 --> 40:17.080
just to get away from Mum and Dad
when they were fighting

40:17.120 --> 40:19.760
or, you know, there was this horse
I used to go and look at

40:19.800 --> 40:21.440
every now and then.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.920
And I never knew whose it was...

40:23.960 --> 40:27.480
but he'd just stand around
in his bit of field by the road,

40:27.520 --> 40:31.440
eating the grass
and getting on with his day.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.240
And...
And I'd talk to him sometimes.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.720
Did you?
Yeah.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.720
Out loud?
Yeah. I called it Susan.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.880
You didn't.
I did.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.800
And I'd say,
"Hello, Susan, how are you today?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.880
I hope you're enjoying
your lovely grass.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.120
Oh, it's windy today,
isn't it, Susan?"

40:48.160 --> 40:49.960
And stuff like that.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.320
And then when I'd get home,
I'd sit on the sofa like this...

40:54.000 --> 40:55.560
..and I'd look at the back...

40:55.600 --> 40:59.360
and, you see where the...
the line meets the wall?

40:59.400 --> 41:01.640
Can you see? Like a horizon?

41:02.640 --> 41:04.400
Oh. Oh, yeah.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.720
And I used to imagine
that the wall was the sky

41:06.760 --> 41:10.760
and that this was the great big
dusty plain like in the films.

41:10.800 --> 41:14.320
And then I'd picture
a tiny little Susan

41:14.360 --> 41:17.800
galloping and galloping for hours...

41:18.680 --> 41:20.920
..and I used to sit and imagine it.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.800
Can you see?

41:26.680 --> 41:28.680
Yes, I can.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.800
Yeah.

41:33.720 --> 41:36.360
That's my life, isn't it, Chris?
That horse.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.920
I suppose it is, yes.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.600
And now since I've met you,
I imagine you on the horse.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.640
Me?
Yeah. And I'm with you.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.160
And we're riding and riding
across the plain,

41:51.200 --> 41:53.120
the wind in our hair...

41:53.160 --> 41:55.640
and I'm holding onto you
as tight as I can.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.440
And then what happens?

42:00.240 --> 42:02.040
Nothing.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.840
Just ride, Chris. Just ride.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.440
Well...

42:10.480 --> 42:13.080
I'm afraid I don't know
how to ride a horse...

42:16.080 --> 42:18.520
..but I can learn.

42:40.840 --> 42:44.040
'In 2005, the Edwards
faked signatures on documents.'

42:44.080 --> 42:47.640
'And around the same time, the
couple's bank account was drained.'

42:49.000 --> 42:51.520
'In later years,
the house was sold...

42:51.560 --> 42:54.080
and benefits were
claimed in their names.'

42:54.120 --> 42:57.720
'They had taken something
in the region of £300,000

42:57.760 --> 43:01.440
and they appear to have spent
every single penny of it.'

43:01.480 --> 43:03.760
'But the deceit didn't end there.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.320
To cover up what they'd done,

43:05.360 --> 43:07.200
the couple also tricked
friends and family

43:07.240 --> 43:09.840
into thinking the Wycherleys
were still alive.

43:10.560 --> 43:14.680
At this point,
William and Patricia Wycherley
had been dead for 13 years.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.560
But the Edwards
eventually ran out of luck.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.040
On what would have been
William Wycherley's 100th birthday,

43:23.080 --> 43:25.800
the Department of Work and Pensions
wrote him a letter,

43:25.840 --> 43:27.960
asking to see him.'

43:28.000 --> 43:31.600
'This was a double murder
motivated by money.'

43:31.640 --> 43:33.280
'Motivated by greed.'

43:34.560 --> 43:37.400
'The Edwards have insisted
they've told the truth.

43:37.440 --> 43:40.080
But police say that from the moment
they were arrested,

43:40.120 --> 43:43.200
the couple have displayed
a heartless attitude.'

43:43.240 --> 43:44.960
'Christopher and Susan Edwards

43:45.000 --> 43:47.880
will appear before
a Crown Court judge on Monday.'

43:47.920 --> 43:50.800
