Previously onYoung Sheldon...

00:04.178 --> 00:05.483
Can we talk?

00:05.527 --> 00:06.963
We better.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.617
What's going on?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.794
I'm pregnant.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.628
Are you sure?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.022
I'm sure.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.764
Sometimes these things
ain't accurate.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.114
Maybe take another one.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.334
Here you go.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.554
Two is convincing,
but-but three...

00:32.597 --> 00:34.034
I'm pregnant, Georgie!

00:34.077 --> 00:35.035
[sighs]

00:35.078 --> 00:36.340
What happens now?

00:36.384 --> 00:37.733
I don't know.

00:37.776 --> 00:40.257
I've never been knocked up
by a 17-year-old before.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.781
Well, if it helps,
I turn 18 in March.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.958
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

00:46.002 --> 00:48.222
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

00:48.265 --> 00:50.789
♪ I bet I could be your hero

00:50.833 --> 00:53.923
♪ I am a mighty little man

00:53.966 --> 00:57.840
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:05.500 --> 01:06.936
What time are you home tonight?

01:06.979 --> 01:08.981
Late. I'm working
at Ballard's

01:09.025 --> 01:10.722
after practice again.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.072
How long can you
keep this up?

01:12.115 --> 01:13.769
Maybe I'll get fired
from the high school

01:13.812 --> 01:15.597
and only have one job
to worry about.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.294
I'm sorry.Me, too.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.601
Oh, I'm assuming
you heard the bad news.

01:19.644 --> 01:20.602
What news?

01:20.645 --> 01:22.169
Isaac Asimov died.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.867
Oh, no, is that one
of your school friends?

01:24.910 --> 01:27.043
What? No, he's one of
the most prolific

01:27.087 --> 01:29.306
science fiction writers
in the history of the genre.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.655
Never heard of him.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.614
Sure you have.
He wrote I, Robot,

01:32.657 --> 01:33.789
the Foundationtrilogy.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.661
Nope. Nightfall? The Posotronic Man?

01:36.705 --> 01:38.315
You ever heard of this guy?Mm-mm.

01:38.359 --> 01:41.449
Caves of Steel. Hostess.
The Naked Sun?

01:41.491 --> 01:43.799
Whoever he is, sorry he died.
Gotta go. Bye.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.539
Bye.ADULT SHELDON: Astonishing.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.933
Asimov wrote almost 500 books,

01:47.977 --> 01:49.848
which was apparently
500 more

01:49.892 --> 01:51.372
than my family had read.

01:52.372 --> 01:54.679
[knock on door]

01:54.723 --> 01:56.507
Can I talk to you
about something?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.640
Come on, this is my coffee time.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.294
It's more important
than your coffee.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.166
If I don't drink my coffee,
I don't go to the bathroom.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.559
That's important.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.474
That girl I was seeing
is pregnant.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.866
You win. Sit.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.176
My folks are gonna
kill me.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.004
They don't know yet?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.310
You're the only person
I told.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.486
Oh, no, I don't want that.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.357
Please help me.

02:20.401 --> 02:21.924
[sighs]

02:21.966 --> 02:24.883
All right, first things first.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.756
Are you sure this kid's
even yours?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.280
Yeah. We've been
sleeping together.

02:30.324 --> 02:33.283
Well, that doesn't mean
it's yours.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.113
Maybe she cheated on me.

02:37.156 --> 02:39.898
We can only hope.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.553
How are you holding up?

02:42.597 --> 02:44.468
With what?

02:44.512 --> 02:46.775
The death of Isaac Asimov.Who?

02:46.817 --> 02:49.168
Pop Pop's favorite science
fiction writer, remember?

02:49.212 --> 02:50.866
[chuckles]
At this rate,

02:50.909 --> 02:52.737
you're lucky I remember Pop Pop.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.218
Well, he gave me Asimov's
Foundationtrilogy

02:55.262 --> 02:56.741
for my fifth birthday.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.744
I remember he used to try to
get me to read that stuff.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.616
Boring!

03:01.659 --> 03:04.836
Boring? Asimov invented
the laws of robotics

03:04.880 --> 03:06.925
and the concept of
a galactic empire.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.276
If a book doesn't have
a shirtless guy

03:09.319 --> 03:11.408
with long hair on the cover,
I ain't reading it.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.368
You're missing out.I'm really not.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.459
You haven't said a thing
about my new car.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.026
Oh. I hate it.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.768
Do you think Pastor Jeff will
let me babysit for him?

03:23.812 --> 03:26.118
I don't know.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.078
Their baby isn't even
a year old yet.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.949
Heather M. got ten bucks,
and all she did was

03:30.993 --> 03:32.777
watch MTV while
her cousin slept.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.170
What a scam.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.998
It's not always that easy.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.392
They lay there like a lump.
How hard can it be?

03:39.697 --> 03:41.917
Will you please just
ask Pastor Jeff?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.007
I don't think you're
gonna like it.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.357
You don't think
I'm responsible enough.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.665
All I said was I don't think
you're gonna like it.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.536
I don't like homework,
but I do it.

03:52.579 --> 03:54.103
I have seen your homework.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.930
Is that how you're gonna
take care of a baby?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.063
Math is harder than babies.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.286
Ooh, perhaps the cold
dark matter we're looking for

04:03.330 --> 04:05.810
is not the axion
but the majoron.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.682
Uh-huh.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.510
That's it?
I just laid down

04:09.553 --> 04:10.772
some big boy science.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.427
Sorry. We lost
a great man today,

04:13.470 --> 04:14.689
and no one seems to care.

04:14.732 --> 04:15.907
Asimov?

04:15.951 --> 04:17.560
Yes, Asimov.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.476
I told three people the news,
and you know what they said?

04:20.521 --> 04:22.305
"Who's that?"Exactly.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.699
What's wrong with the world?
The man's a legend.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.004
I didn't know you were a fan.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.397
Ever since I read
The Naked Sun.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.617
I'll admit,
I came for the naked,

04:29.660 --> 04:32.228
but I stayed for the
interplanetary conspiracies.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.795
Have you read
The Gods Themselves?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.318
"We cannot stop Estwald."

04:35.362 --> 04:37.625
BOTH:
"We areEstwald!"

04:37.668 --> 04:38.756
Who's Estwald?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
You don't know him either?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.805
I know who Asimov is, but
I've never read his work.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.415
Talk about big boy science.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.635
The man coined the term
"robotics."

04:47.678 --> 04:48.897
Ooh.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.986
Maybe we could have
a book club.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.510
My social schedule is
astonishingly open.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.426
What a lovely way to honor
Asimov's life.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.558
It'll be like
my mom's Bible study,

04:58.602 --> 05:00.778
but we know the characters
aren't real.

05:00.822 --> 05:01.910
What book should we
start with?

05:01.953 --> 05:04.173
That naked one sounded good.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.046
It's Georgie.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.440
What?

05:10.484 --> 05:11.920
I know I was
a little freaked out

05:11.963 --> 05:13.791
the last time I was here.You should be.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.402
But I had some time to think,

05:15.445 --> 05:17.795
and there's something
I need to ask you.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.319
Yeah?

05:20.276 --> 05:22.234
Are you sure
that baby's mine?

05:22.278 --> 05:25.194
She did not like
that question at all.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.768
So the baby's yours?

05:33.811 --> 05:35.987
What am I gonna do?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.468
Is there any chance she might
decide not to have it?

05:38.512 --> 05:39.948
Put it up for adoption?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.603
Not happening.
She's keeping it.

05:42.646 --> 05:46.346
Well, I hope you enjoyed
being young and carefree,

05:46.389 --> 05:48.522
because that ship has sailed.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.653
Not helpful.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.829
No.

05:55.832 --> 05:59.359
All right.
I know what I need to do.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.664
Tell your parents?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.187
Do the right thing
and marry her.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.190
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.018
Georgie...

06:07.062 --> 06:09.064
no one has to
get married here.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.414
Well, my dad got my mom
pregnant, and he married her.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.461
Rushing into marriage with
someone you hardly know

06:14.504 --> 06:16.071
is a bad idea.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.508
Maybe we could be
happy together.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.684
How does she feel about you
right now?

06:20.728 --> 06:22.817
Pissed. But she's pregnant,

06:22.860 --> 06:24.427
so it's probably just
chick hormones.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.387
Well, tell her that
and see what happens.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.129
Hey, what are you
doing here?

06:31.173 --> 06:32.522
I just had to talk to Dale.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.438
You all right? You look like
you saw a ghost.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.048
Yeah, I'm good.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.050
Look, I know I've been busy,

06:39.094 --> 06:43.185
but if you ever want to talk,
I'm around.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.756
Actually, uh...

06:50.409 --> 06:53.456
I-I... I got a...
I got a girl pregnant.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.807
What the hell's the matter
with you?!

06:56.851 --> 06:59.941
[shouting]

07:00.550 --> 07:03.858
[grunting]

07:03.901 --> 07:06.426
Hello?

07:06.469 --> 07:09.254
I said if you ever want to talk,
I'm here.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.431
Thanks. Gotta go.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.915
Guess what. Dr. Sturgis,
Dr. Linkletter and I

07:17.959 --> 07:20.222
are starting an Isaac Asimov
book club.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.484
That's nice.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
I'm glad you think so
because you should join.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.227
And I think no.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.447
But this is perfect for you.Why?

07:27.490 --> 07:30.058
Because three smart people
will be there to explain things

07:30.101 --> 07:31.407
that go over your head.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.061
I'm gonna bonk you over
your head in a minute.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.673
What if it's just a short story?
Would you read it then?

07:36.717 --> 07:38.806
Why do you care
if I read this?

07:38.849 --> 07:40.808
Let's see.
Perhaps it has something to do

07:40.851 --> 07:42.505
with Pop Pop dying
before we ever got to

07:42.549 --> 07:44.768
discuss the books he gave me.

07:45.552 --> 07:46.857
How short a story?

07:46.901 --> 07:49.294
Nightfall'sonly 30 pages.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.818
Fine.Excellent.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.733
Why did you change your mind?

07:52.776 --> 07:55.866
Because you made me feel bad
about my dead husband.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.781
Neat.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.435
Pastor Jeff,
this is Missy Cooper.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.003
Hey there, Missy.
What can I do for you?

08:02.046 --> 08:04.005
This is about what
I can do for you.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.659
Okay.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.400
How would you and your wife like
a night away from the baby?

08:08.444 --> 08:11.055
Maybe a movie?
I hear Beethoven'sfunny.

08:11.099 --> 08:12.404
It's about a big dumb dog.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.581
Are you offering to babysit?Yes, I am.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.365
'Cause I asked your mom
about it a while back,

08:16.408 --> 08:19.020
and she said you weren't
interested.Oh, really?

08:19.063 --> 08:20.543
Well, she's wrong.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.025
Fantastic.
How's Friday at 6:00?

08:24.068 --> 08:25.722
Perfect.See you then.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.551
What was the name of
that dog movie again?

08:28.595 --> 08:29.857
Beethoven.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.554
And it's PG,
so God's cool with it.

08:35.078 --> 08:37.299
I saw Georgie stopped by
earlier.

08:37.342 --> 08:40.955
Well, yeah, he does that
once in a while.

08:40.998 --> 08:44.436
Yeah. Didn't realize y'all
were so close.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.570
Oh, uh, I wouldn't say close.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.267
He might. I wouldn't.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.055
So, uh, what'd he come by for?

08:54.098 --> 08:56.057
Just to chat.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.624
Really?Mm.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.627
Well, I guess it's good he's
comfortable talking to someone.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.802
Uh-huh.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.455
Instead of his own father.

09:05.109 --> 09:08.112
I-I'm sure he'll
talk to you.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.159
Thanks.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.033
And you're not gonna like it.

09:16.077 --> 09:19.254
Mom, can I ask you
a Bible question?

09:19.297 --> 09:20.124
Always.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.604
Lying's a sin, right?

09:21.648 --> 09:22.910
Sure is.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.781
Proverbs 12:22.

09:24.825 --> 09:27.044
"The Lord detests lying lips,

09:27.088 --> 09:29.438
but He delights in people
who are trustworthy."

09:29.481 --> 09:31.745
Does it say anything
specifically

09:31.788 --> 09:32.876
about lying to your pastor?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.356
Did you lie to Pastor Jeff?

09:34.399 --> 09:37.141
No, but you did.I did not.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.753
You told him I wasn't
interested in babysitting.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.102
No.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.018
I said I didn't think
you were interested,

09:44.061 --> 09:46.107
which, technically,
was not a lie.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.587
Why don't you trust me?

09:47.630 --> 09:50.938
Because you can't even remember
to take out the trash.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.722
I remember.
I just don't do it.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.115
And for your information,

09:54.158 --> 09:56.639
Pastor Jeff hired me
to babysit this Friday.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.033
He did?He did.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.559
Okay. But if you need
any help,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.040
if you run into
any problems whatsoever,

10:06.083 --> 10:08.172
I am right next door
and I want you to call me.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.652
I'll be fine.Missy...

10:09.696 --> 10:10.914
Okay!

10:13.830 --> 10:15.223
Look, I'm taking out
the trash.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.833
I just put that bag in.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.922
There's no pleasing you.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.752
ADULT SHELDON:
I was envious of my meemaw.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.189
That night, she would get
to experience

10:25.233 --> 10:28.149
one of my favorite stories
for the very first time.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.107
MEEMAW:
"If the stars should appear

10:30.151 --> 10:34.111
"one night in a thousand years,
how would men believe

10:34.155 --> 10:38.115
"and adore, and preserve
for many generations,

10:38.159 --> 10:41.684
the remembrance of
the city of God?"

10:43.381 --> 10:45.340
What?!

10:45.383 --> 10:46.689
SHELDON:
All right,

10:46.733 --> 10:48.778
I would like to call
the first meeting

10:48.822 --> 10:50.998
of the Isaac Asimov
book club to order.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.869
I'm assuming everyone's
read Nightfall?

10:55.306 --> 10:57.221
I read it.
[chuckles]

10:57.265 --> 11:00.181
I may have dozed off
a few times, but I read it.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.661
I read it as well.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.619
I found it quite compelling.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.709
A planet that only experiences
nightfall

11:06.753 --> 11:09.712
once every 2,000 years.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.715
And once it does, it drives
everyone mad. Brilliant.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
I found the tension
between the scientists

11:14.543 --> 11:16.240
and the religious cultists
reminiscent of

11:16.284 --> 11:18.721
some dinnertime conversations
at my house.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.809
[laughter]

11:19.853 --> 11:21.898
What did you think, Connie?

11:21.942 --> 11:23.726
Eh...

11:23.770 --> 11:24.727
You didn't like it?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.076
I don't need a story

11:26.120 --> 11:27.730
set on some outer space planet

11:27.774 --> 11:30.167
to tell me that people
freak out about change.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.603
Interesting.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.693
People lost it when women
started wearing pants

11:33.736 --> 11:35.085
and getting jobs.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.784
Everybody just overreacts
to everything.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.961
Is this because Coach Ballard
got upset and broke up with you?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.092
No.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.964
You two broke up?

11:44.007 --> 11:45.661
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.836
Terrible news.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.403
Terrible. Terrible.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.753
It's okay. I'm over it.

11:50.797 --> 11:51.754
Excellent.Great.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.236
Look at the four of us talking
about Isaac Asimov.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.020
[chuckles]

11:57.891 --> 11:58.282
Mm.

12:03.897 --> 12:04.898
How rude of me, Connie.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.421
Can I offer you a beverage?

12:06.464 --> 12:09.076
Soda, water, Snapple?I'm fine.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.251
I'd take a Snapple.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.209
You know where the fridge is.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.124
Can we get back to the book?

12:14.168 --> 12:16.213
Yes, Connie, I'd love to hear

12:16.257 --> 12:17.911
more of your thoughts on it.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.260
I think I've said my piece.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.609
I have some thoughts.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.611
And we'll get to those
in due time.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.700
Don't you think Asimov did
a remarkable job

12:24.744 --> 12:28.225
of capturing the poetic terror
of the coming darkness?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.923
I'm not sure I got that.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.273
Oh, listen to this.

12:32.316 --> 12:35.102
"Dusk, like a palpable entity,

12:35.145 --> 12:37.800
"entered the room,
and the dancing circle

12:37.844 --> 12:39.628
"of yellow lights
about the torches

12:39.671 --> 12:41.717
"etched itself into
ever-sharper distinction

12:41.761 --> 12:45.068
against the gathering
grayness beyond."

12:49.246 --> 12:50.639
Powerful.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.119
Wasn't it?

12:57.211 --> 12:58.473
I'm going to Pastor Jeff's.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.823
Oh, uh, okay.
Good luck.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.259
Call if you need anything.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.695
Yeah.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.046
You know, I was thinking,
if you want,

13:06.089 --> 13:09.527
you could bring the baby here.
That could be fun.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.095
To a house that isn't
babyproofed?

13:12.139 --> 13:14.315
That seems irresponsible.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.534
Uh-huh.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.016
[phone rings]Hello?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.017
Hi, it's Dale.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.671
Listen, you gotta
tell your dad.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.455
Well, I will, eventually.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.153
Well, if you don't,
I'm gonna.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.242
I just need more time
to figure things out.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.418
Well, your dad's
sniffing around here,

13:30.461 --> 13:31.854
he's asking a lot of questions.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.464
What kind of questions?

13:33.508 --> 13:36.076
Like why are you talking to me
instead of him?

13:36.119 --> 13:37.381
Why does he care?

13:37.425 --> 13:39.688
His feelings are hurt.That's weird.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.473
I know. 'Cause talking to you
ain't great.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.781
Can I get a hand
with something?

13:45.825 --> 13:49.263
Yeah. Oh, gotta go.
I love you, Mom. Bye-bye.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.873
Your mom's still alive?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.396
Huh?

13:52.440 --> 13:57.793
"It was very horrible
to go mad and know

13:57.837 --> 13:59.142
"that you were going mad.

13:59.186 --> 14:02.929
"To know that
in a little minute,

14:02.972 --> 14:05.148
"you would be here physically,

14:05.192 --> 14:07.455
"and yet all the real essence

14:07.498 --> 14:10.719
"would be dead and drowned

14:10.762 --> 14:13.287
in the black madness."

14:15.071 --> 14:16.638
Bravo.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.728
Now I would like to read

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
one of my favorite passages
from the book.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.993
I feel like I am
all Asimov'd out.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.865
Let's hit the road.Very well.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.475
We can kick off
the next meeting with it.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.172
Perhaps I can bake
some cookies.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.218
I'm handy in the kitchen,
you know.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.132
[exhales sharply]

14:32.175 --> 14:34.090
I've had them,
and they're dry.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.661
Hey.Dad around?

14:39.704 --> 14:42.185
He's still at work.
Anything I can help you with?

14:42.229 --> 14:44.013
No, I just need to
talk to him.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.014
[door closes]

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
I am never doing that again.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.453
Is the baby okay?Yeah.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.237
What's going on?

14:50.280 --> 14:51.716
Babies are the worst.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.153
That's what's going on.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.894
She babysat for the first time.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.112
And the last time.

14:56.156 --> 14:59.376
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't
that bad.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.856
Look at this.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.077
Food, powder, vomit, pee.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.687
You don't want to know.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.123
You should have called me.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.344
When? I didn't have
a minute to myself.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.432
You were so right.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.956
Well, it's not about
me being right.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.567
I need a shower
and a bath.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.092
Never again!

15:21.877 --> 15:23.270
You okay?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.706
Uh-huh.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.360
MISSY:
Never again!

15:27.578 --> 15:29.754
I hope you enjoyed that
as much as I did.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.626
Not exactly.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.889
Why? Why?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.413
After Frick and Frack
found out I was single,

15:36.457 --> 15:37.849
they got all weird.

15:37.893 --> 15:38.807
What do you mean?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.156
All they did was
discuss Asimov.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.246
Sure. Maybe I misread
the situation.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.684
I can't believe you'd use
our book club to hit on Connie.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.818
And you didn't, Captain Cookies?

15:49.861 --> 15:51.211
All right, if we're both
gonna pursue her,

15:51.254 --> 15:53.256
let's lay down
some ground rules.Fair enough.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.911
And my ginger snaps are
moist and delicious!

15:55.955 --> 15:57.608
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.133
But hearing you boys
go on about it

16:00.176 --> 16:01.917
did remind me of Pop Pop.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.440
What did he used to say?

16:03.484 --> 16:04.572
[chuckles]

16:04.615 --> 16:06.008
I wish I could remember.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.793
But he did get all
excited about it, like you.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.535
Well, at least I have
Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter

16:11.579 --> 16:12.972
to share my enthusiasm.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.104
Rule number one,
no badmouthing each other

16:15.148 --> 16:16.714
to gain favor with Connie.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.629
Agreed.
And whatever happens,

16:18.673 --> 16:21.371
we can't let it affect
our working relationship.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.721
Our working relationship
is already antagonistic.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.245
True. What's next?

16:25.288 --> 16:27.421
No using Sheldon to win
points with Connie.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.858
But he likes me
better than you.

16:29.901 --> 16:30.990
That's why I brought it up.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.556
Fine.Fine.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.253
Fine.Fine!

16:38.127 --> 16:39.259
[machine beeps]

16:39.302 --> 16:41.174
LINKLETTER:
Connie, Grant Linkletter.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.914
Wonderful seeing you tonight.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.090
Yeah, yeah.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.352
Hope you enjoyed
our little book club.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.354
If you'd ever like to
discuss it further,

16:47.397 --> 16:49.269
I know the perfect
Italian café.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.358
The cannolis are resplendent.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.534
Resplendent!
[chuckles]

16:53.577 --> 16:54.665
[answering machine beeps]

16:54.709 --> 16:55.405
STURGIS: Connie!

16:55.449 --> 16:57.320
John Sturgis here.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.713
What a surprise.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.455
It was so nice to have you
at our book club.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.500
When it comes to
science fiction,

17:03.544 --> 17:06.895
those things can be
real sausage parties.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.202
Anyhoo, if you're free
next week,

17:09.244 --> 17:11.421
I was wondering
if you'd like to...

17:11.464 --> 17:12.727
[machine beeps]

17:12.770 --> 17:14.511
LINKLETTER:
Grant Linkletter again.

17:14.555 --> 17:15.817
If you don't like Italian,

17:15.859 --> 17:17.775
I also know a sublime
Vietnamese spot.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.820
Have you ever tried
Bún Boò Hue?

17:19.864 --> 17:21.214
[machine beeps]

17:21.257 --> 17:23.346
STURGIS: I don't know why
I said "sausage party."

17:23.390 --> 17:24.955
There was probably a better way

17:25.000 --> 17:26.828
to phrase that.[machine beeps]

17:26.871 --> 17:28.917
LINKLETTER:
Connie, Grant Linkletter...

17:31.050 --> 17:32.355
Hey.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.791
Your mother said you wanted
to talk to me?

17:33.835 --> 17:36.229
Yeah. Come in.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.931
So, what's going on?

17:43.932 --> 17:45.629
It's kind of hard
to talk about.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.677
Whatever it is,
I'm here for you.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.029
I...

17:54.073 --> 17:55.987
I got a girl pregnant.
