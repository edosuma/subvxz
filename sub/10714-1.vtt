00:01.702 --> 00:03.655
From the moment your kids are born,

00:03.687 --> 00:06.849
you dread the fact that
one day they'll leave you.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.002
And then they do.

00:09.122 --> 00:12.610
And it's just as bad
as you thought it'd be.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.358
I just want you to remember you're special.

00:15.719 --> 00:17.666
And you'll always be my little girl.

00:18.035 --> 00:20.253
Two forms of birth control.

00:20.595 --> 00:23.235
And men, are like basketball players,

00:23.235 --> 00:25.237
- they dribble before they shoot.
- Martina!

00:25.273 --> 00:26.985
It's reality, Mike.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.888
That's how we ended up with this one.

00:29.105 --> 00:31.413
Bye, guys. I'll miss you.

00:31.431 --> 00:32.901
Oh, I'll miss you too.

00:33.021 --> 00:34.172
- Bye, Dad.
- Love you, kid.

00:34.190 --> 00:35.407
Love you.

00:40.132 --> 00:42.800
Well, at least now we know what it's like.

00:43.224 --> 00:45.207
The next one will be easier.

01:09.353 --> 01:11.246
What are you looking at?

01:11.816 --> 01:14.303
It's just us now, we're alone!

01:22.619 --> 01:24.008
Wow.

01:24.503 --> 01:26.307
The empty nest.

01:27.507 --> 01:29.571
We're gonna die in this house.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.385
I need alcohol.

01:32.872 --> 01:34.693
It is only 10 A.M.

01:35.062 --> 01:38.344
Well, on the other hand, we don't
have to drive anybody anywhere.

01:38.676 --> 01:40.804
Or cook anyone dinner,

01:40.814 --> 01:42.833
or set a good frickin' example.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.105
Hey, we don't have to
say "frickin'" anymore!

01:45.568 --> 01:47.304
I can swear all I want.

01:47.424 --> 01:48.729
Drink when I want.

01:48.849 --> 01:50.406
Have sex when we want.

01:51.659 --> 01:53.913
Have sex when we want.

01:54.859 --> 01:57.203
There's a reason I said that twice.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.989
This could be good.

02:00.008 --> 02:01.703
This could be really good.

02:03.434 --> 02:06.382
_

02:11.358 --> 02:14.144
Finally getting rid of the playroom.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.082
Turn it into a media room.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.913
Big-ass plasma,

02:17.959 --> 02:20.270
we'll have an old-timey
pop-corn machine,

02:20.304 --> 02:21.667
one of those big chairs

02:21.672 --> 02:24.137
with the cup-holders. I'll be
just like a Hollywood douchebag.

02:24.524 --> 02:25.608
Hey.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.283
- I got a new Would You Rather.
- Oh yeah?

02:28.488 --> 02:29.161
OK.

02:29.207 --> 02:30.639
Would you rather...

02:30.924 --> 02:34.982
have sex with Kate Upton ten
minutes after she's dead, or,

02:36.094 --> 02:37.948
have sex with a live

02:38.068 --> 02:39.895
90-year-old.

02:42.034 --> 02:44.550
I've never loved you more
than I do at this moment.

02:45.542 --> 02:46.871
So sick,

02:47.368 --> 02:49.541
yet, so perfectly balanced.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.235
Thank you.

02:51.264 --> 02:52.257
Kate Upton.

02:52.468 --> 02:56.142
This is the perfect way to celebrate
writing our last tuition check,

02:56.154 --> 02:59.087
and your dad and stepmother
finally moving to Florida.

02:59.099 --> 03:00.901
The last piece to the freedom puzzle.

03:05.995 --> 03:07.575
Look what I found!

03:07.764 --> 03:09.829
That's pot! Our kids were doing drugs?

03:09.846 --> 03:10.582
Mike?

03:10.621 --> 03:12.344
- Martina?
- It's your parents!

03:12.361 --> 03:13.645
Hide the pot!

03:14.731 --> 03:15.848
Wow.

03:15.859 --> 03:17.616
I just felt so young.

03:17.937 --> 03:19.346
- Bob?
- What?

03:19.357 --> 03:21.354
- They're in the playroom!
- What?

03:21.365 --> 03:22.997
The playroom!

03:23.191 --> 03:24.668
They're fine.

03:25.724 --> 03:29.227
Alice, again, the key that we made
for you and Dad was for emergencies.

03:29.289 --> 03:31.616
We knocked on the door,
and you didn't answer.

03:31.622 --> 03:33.824
It could have been an emergency.

03:33.944 --> 03:35.729
Why didn't you just ring the bell?

03:35.791 --> 03:36.898
Ring the bell?

03:36.915 --> 03:39.499
Oh, child, please, we're family.

03:40.110 --> 03:42.272
Family doesn't ring the bell.

03:43.402 --> 03:44.486
Oh, hey, Pop.

03:44.703 --> 03:47.180
Oh, good, you're finally
cleaning this room.

03:48.337 --> 03:50.590
You didn't have all these
toys when you were a kid.

03:51.076 --> 03:51.909
I know.

03:53.774 --> 03:55.405
You spoiled those girls.

03:55.714 --> 03:56.796
You know, when Mike was young,

03:56.797 --> 03:59.164
I taught him how to do
military sheet corners.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.588
He couldn't go out to
play until I could bounce

04:01.605 --> 04:03.525
a coin off his tidily made bed.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.931
I still get a little
tense when I see a quarter.

04:06.936 --> 04:09.543
We tried to help with Stella and Shea.

04:09.545 --> 04:11.859
Yes, you were here all the time.

04:13.149 --> 04:15.237
Well, we're headed to the store.

04:15.357 --> 04:16.902
We'll bring you back some donuts.

04:16.947 --> 04:18.973
Alice, we don't eat donuts.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.724
And you know I'm gluten-free.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.949
Oh, that nonsense.

04:23.947 --> 04:25.784
That's why you so skinny.

04:26.593 --> 04:28.596
I don't think I'm too skinny.

04:28.716 --> 04:31.163
You can't see your own skinny.

04:31.990 --> 04:33.799
It's like smelling your own breath.

04:33.827 --> 04:36.491
You need someone else to
tell you that it's bad.

04:36.503 --> 04:38.616
Mike, I'll pick you up some breath mints.

04:41.353 --> 04:43.247
When are you gonna stand up to them?

04:43.367 --> 04:44.816
Well, I've always said "soon".

04:45.118 --> 04:46.465
But now that they're moving,

04:46.721 --> 04:48.387
I can give the truthful answer:

04:48.507 --> 04:49.294
never.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.437
So what are we gonna do with this?

05:01.617 --> 05:03.835
***

05:06.096 --> 05:07.351
Deep.

05:09.479 --> 05:12.029
*** about smoking pot when you're older?

05:13.301 --> 05:14.727
They don't get paranoid.

05:16.821 --> 05:18.178
It's the cops!

05:28.004 --> 05:29.726
Oh, thank God, you're home!

05:29.777 --> 05:31.586
- Stella?
- Brace yourselves.

05:31.643 --> 05:32.938
I left Justin.

05:33.114 --> 05:35.123
I thought he was my soul mate, and now,

05:35.151 --> 05:37.233
we don't even hate the same Kardashians.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.896
We had this big fight, and he's dead to me.

05:41.016 --> 05:43.019
Is he dead to everyone, did you kill him?

05:44.485 --> 05:46.242
Answer your father!

05:47.446 --> 05:48.758
What is wrong with you guys?

05:48.769 --> 05:51.302
Nothing. I could really
use a pizza, but go on.

05:52.414 --> 05:53.907
Ok.

05:54.027 --> 05:56.545
Well, I'm here because I'm
not getting any acting jobs,

05:56.572 --> 05:58.631
and my YouTube videos
don't get enough hits.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.900
And some of those comments, are so mean.

06:00.903 --> 06:01.930
This one guy wrote,

06:01.955 --> 06:04.784
"you're a waste of human
skin, you hot-skank mess."

06:05.031 --> 06:06.287
I mean the "hot" was sweet.

06:07.426 --> 06:08.692
But the rest...

06:09.087 --> 06:10.763
being an adult is hard.

06:10.883 --> 06:13.007
Plus I miss you guys, so...

06:13.023 --> 06:15.226
- I was wondering...
- Hello, all.

06:15.629 --> 06:17.848
Forgive the surprise.

06:17.882 --> 06:19.592
Shea? What are you doing here?

06:19.829 --> 06:21.719
- I'm moving back home.
- What?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.338
But I told you I was coming
here today to move back home.

06:24.339 --> 06:25.339
What?

06:26.349 --> 06:28.729
Yes, but I reasoned that
the cumulative impact

06:28.738 --> 06:29.809
on them would be reduced

06:29.818 --> 06:32.092
if it were simultaneous
rather than staggered.

06:32.212 --> 06:35.247
Ew. Shea, you don't just
break into someone's scene.

06:38.355 --> 06:39.950
We're not in a movie, Stella.

06:40.029 --> 06:41.478
This is the real world.

06:41.598 --> 06:44.158
A world where thanks to this
country's hatred of science,

06:44.191 --> 06:46.077
the funding for my job has been eliminated.

06:46.518 --> 06:49.477
So, like 23.8% of people
between the ages of

06:49.490 --> 06:50.753
22 and 31,

06:50.976 --> 06:53.797
I've determined the most logical
course of action in this economy,

06:53.817 --> 06:55.421
is to move back in with my parents.

06:56.598 --> 06:58.630
And because of the broad number
of young people doing this,

06:58.663 --> 07:00.609
there's no longer the
social stigma attached.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.942
Though, it pains me to admit
I care about such things.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.413
Is she done? I can never
tell when she's done.

07:10.091 --> 07:11.832
I'm the one who should move back in.

07:11.852 --> 07:13.706
Mom and Dad are like my best friends.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.140
They're my only friends!

07:15.930 --> 07:18.474
Girls, girls, don't fight.

07:18.526 --> 07:21.769
You're equally disappointing both of us.

07:22.728 --> 07:26.055
- Hello? We hear voices in there.
- Oh, boy.

07:26.274 --> 07:27.607
It's Grandma!

07:28.540 --> 07:30.934
Are you girls here for
our anniversary dinner?

07:30.954 --> 07:33.952
- Oh, no. I'm moving back home today.
- So am I.

07:34.072 --> 07:37.944
Oh, well, we certainly
can't move to Florida now!

07:40.298 --> 07:42.248
It looks like you need us again.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.348
Who wants donuts?

07:45.511 --> 07:46.794
They're back!

07:47.018 --> 07:48.517
They're all back!

07:49.714 --> 07:50.854
It's a nightmare.

07:50.858 --> 07:52.982
It's a [Bleep] disaster!

07:54.448 --> 07:56.908
Oh, god, we can't say [Bleep] anymore.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.327
- Where are you going?
- Where there's donuts.

08:05.581 --> 08:07.402
Hey. You got a passenger.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.902
Real slacker type.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.723
Sounds like my daughter's boyfriend.

08:11.894 --> 08:13.373
It is my daughter's boyfriend.

08:16.353 --> 08:17.392
Oh, that knock.

08:17.512 --> 08:19.272
Come in, Justin.

08:19.897 --> 08:21.376
Hey.

08:21.496 --> 08:23.480
Hey. Here's how you knock.

08:25.282 --> 08:26.202
It's not...

08:27.004 --> 08:28.102
Why?

08:28.135 --> 08:31.528
Because we as a society have
decided that's how you knock.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.645
What are you doing here?

08:32.765 --> 08:33.927
I miss Stella.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.650
I was hoping you'd help me get her back.

08:35.852 --> 08:36.938
Look, Justin,

08:37.366 --> 08:39.924
no man thinks any guys is good
enough for his little girl.

08:39.957 --> 08:40.986
And then I met you,

08:40.988 --> 08:42.635
and please don't take this the wrong way,

08:42.636 --> 08:43.679
but I thought,

08:44.034 --> 08:45.501
he's not even close.

08:45.935 --> 08:47.677
I mean, do you even have a job?

08:47.797 --> 08:49.354
I have something better than a job.

08:49.381 --> 08:51.067
And idea for an app.

08:51.261 --> 08:53.142
Everybody's with the app.

08:53.437 --> 08:54.496
Man, it's awesome.

08:54.616 --> 08:56.640
But figuring out how to actually make it,

08:56.646 --> 08:58.000
super hard.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.802
Look, that's the problem
with people your age,

09:00.815 --> 09:03.885
once it gets hard, you quit.
You gotta stick with things.

09:04.319 --> 09:06.624
I like that. Could you text that to me?

09:06.666 --> 09:07.626
Get out.

09:08.395 --> 09:10.335
What happens if I push this button?

09:10.455 --> 09:12.189
That'll get you out even faster.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.756
Push it.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.915
A mess.

09:22.921 --> 09:25.775
We spent so much time teaching
the girls how special they are,

09:25.807 --> 09:27.741
why didn't we teach them
how to shut a cabinet door?

09:28.713 --> 09:30.758
Why do we buy free-range chicken?

09:31.719 --> 09:33.609
I mean, how free are they really?

09:35.039 --> 09:37.071
It's not like they're
letting them walk into town.

09:39.668 --> 09:40.884
Speaking of

09:41.004 --> 09:43.436
- freeing things...
- Mike, stop it.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.512
We are not asking the girls to leave.

09:45.632 --> 09:47.558
They're hurting right
now, and they need us.

09:47.559 --> 09:48.559
Ok.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.437
It's quiet.

09:51.923 --> 09:54.356
Maybe we can have the place to ourselves.

09:54.476 --> 09:56.716
- No one yelling out.
- Mom?

09:56.914 --> 09:58.150
Mom?

09:58.301 --> 10:00.622
Tell Shea she's never
gonna get date with Carter

10:00.649 --> 10:02.513
if she texts like a dorky virgin.

10:03.161 --> 10:05.318
Let me see what you wrote, honey.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.644
"I'm interested in dating you.
Do you share similar feelings?"

10:10.683 --> 10:13.918
- Ooh. That's bad.
- I know.

10:14.121 --> 10:16.758
But Stella wants me to
text "Hang sometime?"

10:16.878 --> 10:18.251
I can't send that.

10:18.277 --> 10:19.609
It's a meaningless statement.

10:19.611 --> 10:22.472
Shea, you have to put
yourself out there, be sexy,

10:22.592 --> 10:24.109
and stop dressing like Doria.

10:24.944 --> 10:27.456
I've put myself out there with Carter.

10:27.576 --> 10:29.757
Last week, he was making an AU calculation

10:29.777 --> 10:31.743
that would have been off
by thousands of parsecs

10:31.756 --> 10:33.860
and I thoughtfully pointed out his mistake.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.077
That's love.

10:35.978 --> 10:37.010
Is she done?

10:37.996 --> 10:39.614
I can never tell when she's done.

10:41.061 --> 10:43.480
- Mom, talk to her.
- Honey,

10:43.520 --> 10:45.431
you never correct a man you like.

10:45.847 --> 10:46.827
Really?

10:50.818 --> 10:53.796
Until you're married and have
two daughters to back you up.

10:54.664 --> 10:57.458
Look, men are like balloons.

10:57.578 --> 11:01.252
They don't want anyone to pop 'em and
show that it's all just air inside.

11:01.699 --> 11:05.467
All you gotta do is fill that
balloon with what they want to hear.

11:05.816 --> 11:08.579
It's like how for Dad you act
all excited about the Mets.

11:08.636 --> 11:10.596
Hey, I never pushed Shea to be a Mets fan.

11:10.858 --> 11:12.739
You named me after their stadium.

11:14.764 --> 11:16.783
But I love the Mets because you love them.

11:17.197 --> 11:18.422
That's my girl.

11:18.682 --> 11:20.024
Ok, it works.

11:22.227 --> 11:23.870
"Hang sometime?"

11:23.884 --> 11:25.843
And... send.

11:26.862 --> 11:28.585
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

11:28.705 --> 11:31.313
If you know all this, how can't
you work things out with Justin?

11:31.433 --> 11:35.061
It's just super hard when two
brilliant complex artists get together.

11:36.351 --> 11:39.079
We still talking about
you and Justin, right?

11:39.534 --> 11:41.427
I miss him so much.

11:41.547 --> 11:43.867
Look, Stella, why don't
you forget about boys,

11:43.880 --> 11:46.622
and focus on what you're
gonna do with your life?

11:46.742 --> 11:47.839
Maybe you're right.

11:47.959 --> 11:48.996
I mean,

11:49.116 --> 11:51.278
I have a degree in theater arts.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.217
It's crazy that I'm not using it.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.294
Oh, you're using it some.

11:57.498 --> 11:59.661
I'm a singer and an actress.

11:59.668 --> 12:02.179
- That's like having two lottery tickets.
- Yes.

12:02.561 --> 12:04.521
As valuable as two lottery tickets.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.098
Hey, let's all do something.

12:07.106 --> 12:09.066
We can watch a movie
like when we were kids.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.859
Perhaps a Disney princess movie?

12:10.919 --> 12:12.280
Not Beauty and the Beast.

12:12.307 --> 12:13.799
Belle's so basic.

12:14.470 --> 12:16.008
Don't you put down Belle.

12:16.128 --> 12:18.626
She was willing to marry an
animal to get a good library.

12:21.604 --> 12:22.985
I'm exhausted.

12:23.241 --> 12:26.141
I forgot how much energy parenting takes.

12:26.483 --> 12:27.450
But...

12:27.923 --> 12:29.356
they like us.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.559
They really do.

12:32.006 --> 12:33.143
How do we get away from them?

12:36.719 --> 12:38.178
A naked woman in bed with me,

12:38.195 --> 12:39.927
the only reason I ever do anything.

12:42.039 --> 12:43.650
Lying,

12:43.689 --> 12:46.037
sneaking off to a hotel.

12:46.157 --> 12:48.049
We're like Stella in high school.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.245
No kid talk.

12:50.501 --> 12:52.447
That's the deal.

12:55.051 --> 12:57.636
Whatever it is, they can wait 5 minutes.

12:58.326 --> 13:00.128
I mean 45 minutes.

13:00.897 --> 13:02.896
But it could be the girls.

13:04.362 --> 13:05.979
It's Shea.

13:06.006 --> 13:07.827
Carter hasn't texted back.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.305
Now it's Stella.

13:13.344 --> 13:15.639
Justin got tagged in a
picture with some girl.

13:15.658 --> 13:18.597
Oh, my poor babies.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.458
Ok.

13:21.938 --> 13:24.989
No, no, look, you're
gonna do that thing now,

13:24.995 --> 13:27.806
where you're thinking about the
kids when we're about to have sex.

13:28.047 --> 13:30.085
I'm gonna be here doing
some of my best work

13:30.309 --> 13:32.807
and you're gonna have this
worried look in your eyes.

13:33.781 --> 13:35.888
I can't help it. A mother is only
as happy as her unhappiest child.

13:37.696 --> 13:39.907
What about her unhappiest husband?

13:40.915 --> 13:42.007
You know what, hon?

13:42.026 --> 13:43.407
We should probably just go.

13:43.447 --> 13:47.103
Why? Wait, that is not
fair. I wanna do this.

13:47.223 --> 13:48.516
Don't you get it?

13:48.636 --> 13:50.459
The fun is over.

13:51.325 --> 13:52.996
I mean this is supposed to be our time.

13:52.996 --> 13:54.995
But it is their time again.

13:55.285 --> 13:58.650
Oh my god. You're right.
This is our life now.

13:58.770 --> 14:01.252
Isn't it? There is no
getting away from them.

14:01.286 --> 14:03.739
You know whose fault it
is? It's ours. We did this.

14:03.752 --> 14:05.626
We made them our friends.

14:06.008 --> 14:09.157
We were so involved in
their lives, we listened, we

14:09.216 --> 14:11.722
- supported, we validated.
- We blew it.

14:12.761 --> 14:16.220
Now we have to sneak off to a
hotel room to get away from them?

14:16.252 --> 14:18.869
If we'd only spanked them
once, we could have saved $200.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.359
We could have saved a boatload more

14:21.385 --> 14:23.274
if we'd done what my
father did, and just left.

14:23.545 --> 14:24.773
It's too late for that.

14:25.244 --> 14:27.422
Okay, I'm in. They got to go.

14:27.455 --> 14:29.796
- And your parents.
- All right, here's the deal.

14:29.829 --> 14:31.486
Tomorrow is their anniversary party.

14:31.545 --> 14:33.038
We get everybody together,

14:33.064 --> 14:34.338
we tell them how much we love 'em,

14:34.458 --> 14:37.003
- and then we kick 'em to the curb.
- Deal.

14:37.123 --> 14:37.943
All right.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.711
Let's get our 200 bucks worth.

14:45.747 --> 14:48.712
Oh, this one's from Mike and Martina.

14:48.778 --> 14:51.639
I bet it's that scarf I've been hinting at.

14:52.146 --> 14:53.513
Oh...

14:53.762 --> 14:56.840
look, Bob, it's some sort of coupon.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.437
It's airline miles.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.731
Yes, we gifted you our miles,

15:00.732 --> 15:03.875
so that when you do
decide to move to Florida

15:03.907 --> 15:07.030
you can upgrade to 1st class
if there's a seat available.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.582
"If there's a seat"?

15:09.528 --> 15:12.968
So, we go to the airport, with
no idea where we're going to sit,

15:12.981 --> 15:15.947
and then just announce ourselves
like we think we're so great?

15:16.334 --> 15:19.997
I don't think 1st class is
for us. We'd be uncomfortable.

15:20.036 --> 15:22.475
But there's more room and
you get to board first.

15:22.495 --> 15:25.020
But then we'd have to watch
the other passengers go by us.

15:25.079 --> 15:28.214
Everybody hates those 1st class
people when they walk by them.

15:28.274 --> 15:30.508
We'd be the people they hate!

15:30.628 --> 15:33.686
Look, let's just call this
a bad gift and move on.

15:36.494 --> 15:39.466
Our gift aside, I'd like to make a toast.

15:39.913 --> 15:43.938
Multi-generation events like this remind
one of the natural order of things.

15:44.791 --> 15:46.134
First you're a child,

15:46.429 --> 15:47.461
then you grow older,

15:47.581 --> 15:48.904
and eventually you leave home and

15:48.913 --> 15:50.627
stand proudly upon your own two feet

15:50.627 --> 15:52.972
taking any jobs you can,
even if it's not your dream.

15:53.989 --> 15:55.950
THen you grow old and you move to Florida.

15:57.753 --> 15:58.791
Cheers.

16:00.849 --> 16:03.637
But you and Mom always told
us to follow our dreams.

16:03.801 --> 16:06.866
Yes, we did and that
may have been a mistake.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.654
See, we didn't think everybody in your
generation would have the same dream,

16:09.697 --> 16:11.934
to be an actress or win
singing competitions.

16:11.975 --> 16:14.625
Surely you're not *** my
dream of becoming an astronaut

16:14.643 --> 16:17.051
with hoping that Cher
turns around on The Voice.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.669
Dad, what are you trying to tell us?

16:20.135 --> 16:22.035
Clearly they want us to leave.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.047
- Is that true?
- Well,

16:24.113 --> 16:26.605
- it might be time.
- Wow.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.985
- I didn't know you guys didn't want us here.
- Neither did I.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.418
Sometimes I have trouble with social cues.

16:32.538 --> 16:35.948
I was perceiving joy and you were
feeling shackled, and burdened.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.260
- No, no.
- We do not feel that way,

16:38.286 --> 16:41.100
and we want to be
supportive in any way we can.

16:41.146 --> 16:42.901
Well, that didn't take long.

16:43.993 --> 16:45.332
What is that supposed to mean?

16:45.452 --> 16:47.162
You're going soft already.

16:47.432 --> 16:50.049
You remember the summer that you turned 16?

16:50.331 --> 16:52.784
I locked you out of the
house with a bowl of cereal

16:52.791 --> 16:56.004
and the Wants Ads and I said, "don't
you come home until you've got a job".

16:56.124 --> 16:57.361
Now that's parenting.

16:57.481 --> 16:59.294
I hated you that day.

16:59.327 --> 17:03.100
I've though to myself, "I can't
wait to get away from these people."

17:03.121 --> 17:04.613
See? Success!

17:04.988 --> 17:06.823
I would never do that to my daughters!

17:06.848 --> 17:09.070
- I like them.
- Well, there's your mistake.

17:09.117 --> 17:11.386
You love your children,
you don't like them!

17:11.596 --> 17:13.200
I wanna be close to my girls.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.988
When I was growing up,
you and Mom had no idea

17:15.005 --> 17:16.330
what was going on in my life.

17:16.508 --> 17:18.493
We weren't that interested in you.

17:19.453 --> 17:20.627
Well, I'm not you, Dad.

17:20.662 --> 17:22.241
And I don't push my kids
away when they need me.

17:22.255 --> 17:23.255
Girls, you can stay.

17:24.056 --> 17:27.458
You might call that weak, I call it
a strong man making a strong decision.

17:27.718 --> 17:28.731
It's okay with you, dear?

17:29.626 --> 17:32.342
Of course. We love you.

17:34.617 --> 17:35.919
That's good parenting, right here.

17:37.983 --> 17:39.488
Oh, that knock!

17:40.297 --> 17:41.599
It's Justin.

17:43.894 --> 17:45.834
Hi, Stella, you look smokin'.

17:45.954 --> 17:47.280
Hey, everybody.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.174
Justin, why are you here?

17:49.294 --> 17:50.923
I'm taking your dad's advice.

17:50.983 --> 17:53.521
- He told me I shouldn't quit on you.
- I did not say that.

17:54.717 --> 17:56.374
Well, something like that.

17:56.598 --> 17:58.814
You never texted me, so
I don't got it exactly.

17:59.622 --> 18:02.956
But he said, if you want
something, you should stick with it.

18:03.324 --> 18:04.698
And I want you.

18:05.505 --> 18:06.473
Justin...

18:06.657 --> 18:07.998
I want you too.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.747
You're a... full balloon

18:11.069 --> 18:12.825
and no one should pop you.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.652
I'll explain metaphors to her later.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.790
Let's go home baby.

18:17.910 --> 18:20.748
Um, about that... we kinda got evicted.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.188
Well, you can stay here with me.

18:22.189 --> 18:26.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
guys are not even married.

18:26.785 --> 18:28.310
I hear ya, bro.

18:28.738 --> 18:30.533
Stella, will you marry me?

18:30.586 --> 18:33.242
- No, no, no!
- Yes!

18:38.555 --> 18:41.941
I should rub it in, but
I just feel sorry for you.

18:47.570 --> 18:50.272
How can you drink ice
latte at this time of night?

18:50.502 --> 18:53.014
Why does that bother you? I sleep fine.

18:53.368 --> 18:54.878
It's just suspicious.

18:57.215 --> 18:59.759
- Is she really gonna marry that guy?
- Oh...

19:00.062 --> 19:03.303
let's don't think about that tonight.

19:03.593 --> 19:04.671
Honey,

19:05.670 --> 19:07.991
we can keep the fun going.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.583
How about you go get some wine

19:10.603 --> 19:13.127
and I'll put on something ridiculous.

19:13.824 --> 19:15.533
Are we talking parading?

19:15.599 --> 19:17.207
Oh, I'll parade.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.143
I love a parade.

19:23.719 --> 19:27.000
Hey, listen, better make sure
we're not stuck with those miles.

19:29.485 --> 19:31.806
- We'll get you another gift.
- Oh, good.

19:32.023 --> 19:33.648
Nothing crazy this time.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.962
- Now, about our staying...
- Dad, go to Florida.

19:36.988 --> 19:39.381
Have fun. We really
don't need your help here.

19:39.641 --> 19:41.321
Well, don't tell your stepmom that.

19:41.506 --> 19:43.518
She was miserable about moving.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.251
You know, it's nice to feel needed,

19:45.276 --> 19:48.422
and not just going some
place warm to rot and die.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.482
Besides, who wants to be
around a lot of old people.

19:51.507 --> 19:53.282
Old people are annoying.

19:54.421 --> 19:55.512
Are they?

19:57.545 --> 20:00.152
I know you think I'm too
conservative and old fashioned,

20:00.168 --> 20:02.989
but I did marry a black woman,
that's gotta mean something.

20:03.541 --> 20:05.133
Dad, I don't see race.

20:05.692 --> 20:08.533
I see a bossy woman who you
married, who's always in my house.

20:09.466 --> 20:10.623
Fair enough.

20:10.743 --> 20:14.049
You know, I don't agree with
how you raised these girls, but

20:14.338 --> 20:16.238
I see how much they like you.

20:16.804 --> 20:18.356
That must feel kinda good.

20:18.476 --> 20:19.506
It does.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.384
I don't think my pop even knew I existed

20:22.419 --> 20:24.686
until I was staring in
his direct line of sight.

20:24.946 --> 20:26.674
Well, he never talked to you?

20:26.794 --> 20:29.245
Asked you how you're
feeling? How you doing?

20:29.365 --> 20:30.245
Never.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.261
- Different times.
- Yeah, different times,

20:33.304 --> 20:35.335
but it would have been
nice if he had, right?

20:36.361 --> 20:37.328
Yeah.

20:37.854 --> 20:39.182
It would have been nice.

20:40.412 --> 20:41.549
Goodnight, Son.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.291
Goodnight, Dad.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.235
- Mike?
- Yeah?

20:51.490 --> 20:52.970
How you doin', Son?

20:53.687 --> 20:54.936
I'm good.

20:55.640 --> 20:56.567
You?

20:57.731 --> 20:58.829
Good too.

20:59.631 --> 21:00.643
Good.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.578
Did you tell him we don't want the miles?

21:12.793 --> 21:13.871
What?

21:13.898 --> 21:16.147
- The miles!
- He told me.

21:21.098 --> 21:24.925
I hope whatever you put
on is easy to take off.

21:26.141 --> 21:27.535
Hello, ladies.

21:30.771 --> 21:33.415
Good new, honey, the girls
came in to tell me that

21:33.448 --> 21:35.697
- Carter texted back.
- Told you he would.

21:36.091 --> 21:38.360
Remember, two forms of birth control,

21:38.406 --> 21:39.609
right, Mom and Dad?

21:40.628 --> 21:43.810
I feel very uncomfortable
in this conversation.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.349
Why? We're all adults here.

21:45.350 --> 21:46.691
Then why are you living at home?

21:47.987 --> 21:49.828
Oh, Dad, you're so funny.

21:51.064 --> 21:52.472
I have a suggestion:

21:52.592 --> 21:54.280
how about I get two more glasses?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.625
Ooh, I have an even better idea. Ok,

21:56.627 --> 21:59.586
don't freak out, but I have
some pot stashed in the playroom.

21:59.612 --> 22:01.618
- I'll go get it.
- Don't bother.

22:01.847 --> 22:02.761
Why?

22:02.775 --> 22:04.359
- We smoked it.
- We got rid of it.
