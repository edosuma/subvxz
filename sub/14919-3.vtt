WEBVTT

00:07.891 --> 00:09.017
Wow, what's all this?

00:09.159 --> 00:11.923
Oh, I'm doing all the costumes
for Cooper's play.

00:16.032 --> 00:17.363
What?

00:17.500 --> 00:21.402
Nothing, nothing. I think you look real cute
with your needle and thread.

00:22.005 --> 00:24.337
Like my grandmother darning a sock.

00:27.243 --> 00:30.770
- Okay, just joking.
- Not funny.

00:32.148 --> 00:34.446
So any big plans today, birthday girl?

00:34.584 --> 00:35.642
Thought I forgot?

00:37.153 --> 00:39.121
No. You know me, Luc.

00:39.255 --> 00:42.622
I don't really like to make a big deal
about my birthday. Just let it go.

00:42.759 --> 00:45.751
Yeah, but this one is the big one, okay?

00:47.664 --> 00:49.598
Yeah, so let me at least take you out
to dinner.

00:50.633 --> 00:54.296
Okay. You know,
I've really gotta finish all these costumes.

00:54.437 --> 00:56.997
- I've got this headdress I've gotta do...
- Wait.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.537
I set it up. Please.
You have to come with me.

01:01.678 --> 01:03.839
It's just you and I.
It's great food, great wine.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.447
Please, it's important to me.

01:05.749 --> 01:08.411
- Just the two of us.
- Just the two of us.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.284
- Yeah.
- Okay, yes, yes, yes.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.892
- Hi, Kevin.
- Do you wanna call Sarah

01:20.029 --> 01:22.361
and sing "Happy Birthday" in a round?
It really annoys her.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.490
- How bored are you?
- Very.

01:25.635 --> 01:27.933
Why doesn't this woman
have a real coffee maker?

01:28.071 --> 01:30.403
- What woman?
- The woman I rented this house from.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.737
What's her name? Here you go.
"Leslie Culpepper."

01:33.877 --> 01:36.505
So how is it up in Ojai?
Have you found yourself yet?

01:37.814 --> 01:39.805
Well, not exactly.

01:39.949 --> 01:45.012
But I have discovered that peace and quiet
is actually very quiet and peaceful.

01:45.155 --> 01:48.955
- As long as your siblings don't call.
- Oh, what? Country life, you like it?

01:49.092 --> 01:52.528
Don't tell me you're getting
all <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> on us.

01:52.662 --> 01:53.856
<i>You know, I am.</i>

01:53.997 --> 01:56.397
I'll gonna start churning butter
before you know it

01:56.533 --> 01:59.400
and I'm gonna grow one of those
crazy long ponytails down my back

01:59.536 --> 02:01.128
or maybe a bun.

02:01.271 --> 02:03.466
Are we singing or not?

02:10.780 --> 02:12.372
Hello?

02:12.515 --> 02:14.642
Stop that right there.
The only thing more annoying

02:14.784 --> 02:17.446
than listening to you sing
is if Kevin joins in a round.

02:17.587 --> 02:18.849
Hi, Sarah.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.680
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hey.

02:20.824 --> 02:23.520
So, Sarah, how does it feel
to be the older sister?

02:23.660 --> 02:25.525
Oh, good, good.
You know, it's good, it's good.

02:25.662 --> 02:26.856
It's like any other year.

02:26.996 --> 02:29.021
I can't believe how old we're getting.
So depressed.

02:29.165 --> 02:32.931
Yeah. So, Kitty, how is it going
up in Ojai? Sorry.

02:33.069 --> 02:36.505
<i>You know, I actually think I like it.</i>
<i>I mean, it's very simple. It's very simple.</i>

02:36.639 --> 02:38.573
<i>People cook, people garden.</i>

02:38.708 --> 02:40.437
- <i>Do you have to go?</i>
- Nobody recognizes me.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.737
I could be anybody.

02:41.878 --> 02:45.211
It's like that summer at camp
I told everyone I was a teenage spy.

02:45.348 --> 02:46.838
<i>Oh, my God, soufflé.</i>

02:47.917 --> 02:49.782
I've always wanted to make soufflé.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.251
<i>I swear to you this time</i>
<i>I'm gonna learn how to cook.</i>

02:52.388 --> 02:54.083
See you tonight.

02:57.026 --> 02:59.051
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

02:59.195 --> 03:04.758
No one is gonna talk anymore
about my birthday.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.061
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Why?

03:06.202 --> 03:10.798
There'll be no presents, no flowers
and absolutely no cake with candles.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.568
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just not into it this year.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.739
That's gonna be really hard, Sarah,

03:15.879 --> 03:18.541
because Luc is planning a surprise dinner
for you.

03:19.582 --> 03:22.380
No, he's not. No. No.
We're just going out.

03:22.518 --> 03:24.577
Just the two of us, very low-key.

03:24.721 --> 03:27.155
Wrong. It's at the restaurant.
We're all invited.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.485
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I know how you hate surprises.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.027
Okay, listen, you've got to call him. Kitty,
call and tell him that you can't make it.

03:33.162 --> 03:35.255
You live up in Ojai.
It's a really good excuse.

03:35.398 --> 03:37.696
- What's my excuse? I live upstairs.
- <i>I don't know.</i>

03:37.834 --> 03:40.769
You've got to wash your hair.
Kevin, I don't care. You're not going.

03:41.070 --> 03:43.129
Wait a minute.
You really don't want me to come?

03:43.273 --> 03:44.467
- No.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

03:44.607 --> 03:48.805
- Remember your 40th? I was so drunk.
- Yes, I do. That's the problem.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.344
Well, why is it a problem?

03:51.114 --> 03:55.050
Because Luc thinks
today is my 40th birthday.

03:55.184 --> 03:57.345
Sarah. I'm impressed.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.651
Oh, my God, you've been lying
about your age all this time?

04:01.791 --> 04:04.783
Yes. So just... You have to keep
your mouth shut. The two of you, okay?

04:04.928 --> 04:07.419
Good luck with that.
Because at some point, sooner or later...

04:07.563 --> 04:09.793
- <i>Oh, my God! No, no, no.</i>
- Kitty, are you all right?

04:09.933 --> 04:12.163
You know what? Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

04:12.302 --> 04:14.202
It's just a little plumbing issue.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.998
No, no. See, you didn't do this right.

04:16.139 --> 04:18.971
You just hit tab.
And it automatically adds it for you.

04:19.108 --> 04:20.404
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- Yeah.

04:20.543 --> 04:22.602
I know back in the day
they did things differently,

04:22.745 --> 04:24.440
but this is the 21st century, Nora.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.810
You can throw out your abacus.

04:26.950 --> 04:33.219
Yeah. I'll just do that.
Throw out my abacus.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.620
Oh, sorry.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.717
Okay.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.890
Well, that was snarky.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.498
Yes. Can I help...

04:43.933 --> 04:45.332
- Celia?
- Hi, Nora.

04:45.468 --> 04:48.369
Oh, my goodness. Celia, I almost
didn't recognize... You look fabulous.

04:48.504 --> 04:50.563
Oh, thank you.
What are you doing here?

04:50.707 --> 04:54.006
I'm just trying to reinvent myself.

04:54.143 --> 04:55.838
Me and my abacus.

04:55.979 --> 05:01.076
Oh, sweetie, there are easier ways
to reinvent yourself, you know?

05:01.284 --> 05:03.809
My son-in-law. He's a genius.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.084
- "Dr. Howard Brentley."
- Yeah, a real artist. I'm telling you.

05:11.594 --> 05:13.994
Celia. Oh, my gosh.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.358
Well, you look amazing.

05:16.499 --> 05:18.899
I was losing listings to all the younger,
prettier girls

05:19.035 --> 05:21.435
and I thought if I wanna compete
in the work force,

05:21.571 --> 05:24.904
then what goes up, you know,
must stay up.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.874
- I never would've known.
- It's like I just woke up from a long nap.

05:28.011 --> 05:29.103
Or a coma.

05:29.612 --> 05:32.547
And my boobs. I mean, they're back up
where I can actually see them again.

05:32.682 --> 05:34.445
They're up
where everyone can see them.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.885
- Oh, and look.
- You got your hands done?

05:38.021 --> 05:42.481
No, silly.
I'm engaged to a really wonderful man.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.785
We met on a cruise.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.520
I mean, he's six years younger than I am,
but who's counting?

05:48.798 --> 05:52.928
- So your whole life changed just like that.
- Yeah. I mean, it's out-patient surgery.

05:53.069 --> 05:55.936
A couple weeks on the couch,
popping pills, watching <i>General Hospital,</i>

05:56.072 --> 05:58.666
and, poof, it's like magic.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.901
You want me to see
if I can get the good doctor

06:02.045 --> 06:03.706
to squeeze you in for a consultation?

06:04.680 --> 06:06.671
Well, I...

06:07.617 --> 06:09.710
- Well...
- Nora, everyone's doing it.

06:09.852 --> 06:10.978
- They are?
- Oh, yeah.

06:11.821 --> 06:15.882
Take back your power, honey.
You won't regret it.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.727
- Rebecca? Rebecca?
- Dad. Hey.

06:20.863 --> 06:22.626
Hold on one second.
No, they want an overview

06:22.765 --> 06:24.790
at the meeting,
so I need those shipping reports.

06:24.934 --> 06:27.869
Okay? Yeah, no, I gotta go.
Okay, thanks.

06:28.004 --> 06:29.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.468
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

06:32.608 --> 06:35.236
- Actually, it's better than okay.
- Here. Sit down.

06:35.611 --> 06:38.808
- Yeah? What's going on? How's Mom?
- Oh, she's getting better.

06:38.948 --> 06:41.280
You know, she's never going
to get all of her memory back,

06:41.417 --> 06:45.786
- but she's less frustrated now, so...
- Good.

06:45.922 --> 06:50.120
Listen, I can't make any promises,
but I think she's ready to see you.

06:50.993 --> 06:54.952
What? I mean,
last time she didn't even know who I was

06:55.098 --> 06:57.123
and she was so upset.
The doctors said...

06:57.266 --> 07:02.101
Well, I know what the doctor said,
but she's been asking about you a lot.

07:02.238 --> 07:03.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:03.739 --> 07:07.140
Yeah. She heard
some stories about you

07:07.276 --> 07:10.336
and for whatever reason
they seem to have gotten through.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.541
Yeah, I think she finally really grasps
that she has a daughter.

07:15.485 --> 07:17.578
Oh, my God.

07:17.787 --> 07:21.223
- So I can see her. Like, soon?
- How about tonight?

07:24.260 --> 07:27.093
So, what did you tell her?
What stories did you tell her?

07:27.230 --> 07:28.663
Actually, it wasn't me.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.895
- Who was it?
- It was Justin.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:41.477 --> 07:44.275
I'm just gonna tell him
that I don't feel well.

07:44.413 --> 07:47.507
Oh, Sarah, you can't cancel.
He's been working on this for weeks.

07:47.650 --> 07:48.947
He'll be so disappointed.

07:49.085 --> 07:52.316
You have to promise me, Mom, that you
are not gonna let the cat out of the bag.

07:52.455 --> 07:55.856
You know how you like to blurt things out
at the worst possible time.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.619
I don't do th... I'm not a blurter.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.318
- You're a blurter.
- I'm not a blurter.

07:59.462 --> 08:05.958
I think I need more time to figure out
how I'm gonna break this to him gently.

08:08.171 --> 08:11.197
I don't know why
you let this go on so long.

08:11.340 --> 08:14.138
I mean, look at him, Mom.
He's an underwear model.

08:14.277 --> 08:16.541
He wasn't an underwear model
when you met him.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.341
No, he wasn't, but he looked like one.

08:19.882 --> 08:22.350
Forgive me.
Sometimes I'm a little intimidated.

08:22.485 --> 08:25.852
So, what, you thought shaving a couple
of years off would make you feel better?

08:25.988 --> 08:27.250
Mom, we were in France.

08:27.390 --> 08:29.017
I thought I was never gonna
see him again

08:29.158 --> 08:32.491
and it seemed a perfectly rational thing
to do at the time.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.794
Would you see who that is, please?

08:36.332 --> 08:38.299
"Dr. Brentley"? Who's that?

08:38.433 --> 08:40.994
Nobody. Just push the ignore button.

08:43.339 --> 08:45.637
- You all right, Mom?
- Yes.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.099
- You sure?
- Positive.

08:48.511 --> 08:50.308
Oh, my God.

08:50.846 --> 08:52.108
You're dying, aren't you?

08:53.015 --> 08:55.882
- No, Sarah.
- You are.

08:56.452 --> 09:01.219
- You're dying.
- I'm not dying. All right, all right.

09:01.924 --> 09:03.915
He's a plastic surgeon, okay?

09:04.060 --> 09:08.724
He said he would try to squeeze me in
this afternoon for a consultation.

09:08.864 --> 09:13.494
And don't even start, missy,
with all of your wisecracks.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.501
You have no idea how hard it is

09:15.638 --> 09:18.334
for a woman my age
to compete in the workplace.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.602
What am I supposed to do?
Work in a flower shop the rest of my life?

09:21.744 --> 09:24.804
Or maybe I should be
a wheelchair tester.

09:24.947 --> 09:27.006
Is that even a thing?

09:27.149 --> 09:28.741
I just...

09:29.118 --> 09:35.182
I just wanna feel better about myself
and right now I feel old.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.087
It's okay, Mom. I get it.

09:37.226 --> 09:39.353
I mean, I really get it.

09:39.495 --> 09:44.262
I used to be one of those women who
laughed at people that had work done.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.924
Now it doesn't seem quite so funny.

09:47.069 --> 09:49.833
Oh, Sarah, no.
You're way too young and pretty.

09:49.972 --> 09:51.803
Thank you, but...

09:53.843 --> 09:55.538
I'm supposed to be 40.

09:56.812 --> 10:00.043
I was just thinking
maybe a little, you know...

10:00.916 --> 10:02.781
Really?

10:05.054 --> 10:06.885
Well, maybe you should come
with me today.

10:07.723 --> 10:10.658
- Okay.
- Great.

10:20.469 --> 10:21.697
Coming.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.674
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:28.811 --> 10:30.438
You look different.

10:30.746 --> 10:32.873
- Oh, it's probably my hair.
- Yeah.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.742
- Come in.
- You know, I can't stay, actually.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.854
I've been home for weeks, calling...

10:39.989 --> 10:44.858
You know, I really wanted to say
thank you for talking to my mother.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.419
Yeah.

10:48.331 --> 10:49.821
- Your dad say something?
- Yeah,

10:49.965 --> 10:52.490
he said it might really be helping, so...

10:53.436 --> 10:55.961
I'm going over there today to see her

10:56.105 --> 11:00.542
and, you know, I guess I'm just curious,
you know. What you told her.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.144
Nothing.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.340
- You're really not gonna tell me?
- You're really not gonna come in?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.852
- We can't go back to the way things were.
- What? Why not?

11:11.987 --> 11:14.581
Pretending nothing happened.
You know exactly why.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.525
I'm sorry. This was a bad idea.

11:17.893 --> 11:19.690
Rebecca, look,
I told her how we fell in love.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.757
From the moment I saw you
and how weird it was,

11:22.898 --> 11:25.423
but I couldn't stop thinking about you.

11:26.469 --> 11:27.902
And how I took you up on the hill

11:28.037 --> 11:30.699
- and we kissed for the first time.
- Yeah, I get it.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.705
Rebecca, come in the house.

11:39.348 --> 11:41.043
I can't. I'm sorry.

11:44.053 --> 11:45.918
There isn't too much damage.

11:46.055 --> 11:48.990
I should be able to get it up and working
in an hour, two max.

11:50.659 --> 11:52.957
Wow, well, that's great.
Thanks very much.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.928
Sorry it took me so long to get here.
Traffic on the bridge.

11:56.065 --> 12:00.058
Yeah, you know, I kind of grew up here,
so I totally get it.

12:00.202 --> 12:02.170
I thought you looked kind of familiar.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.862
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:04.006 --> 12:06.406
You've probably seen me
at the farmers' market and...

12:07.176 --> 12:10.873
But, you know, I wanted to just say
thank you for coming on such short notice

12:11.013 --> 12:13.777
because it definitely
was kind of an emergency.

12:13.916 --> 12:17.852
No problem at all. Anything to keep me
from this other job I'm working on.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.249
Renters from the city.

12:19.388 --> 12:23.324
They walk around with those Bluetooth
things attached to their ears all day.

12:23.459 --> 12:26.292
Yeah, no, that is terrible. I...

12:26.662 --> 12:28.459
Like, totally, totally know the type.

12:28.597 --> 12:31.430
It's like they're so busy
climbing that ladder,

12:31.567 --> 12:34.468
they're missing out on everything else.
The simple things, you know?

12:34.603 --> 12:37.003
- Yeah, I know.
- Before you know it,

12:37.139 --> 12:41.132
another beautiful day has come and gone,
they haven't even noticed.

12:41.277 --> 12:43.074
Sad, isn't it?

12:43.212 --> 12:45.942
Yeah, yeah. It is. It is sad.

12:46.081 --> 12:49.608
- Agents, plastic surgeons, movie stars.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.083
- We get them all up here.
- Yeah.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.552
But the politicians are the worst.

12:54.590 --> 12:55.989
It's a... Let's...

12:56.826 --> 13:01.126
Totally fine. Totally fine.
Just went down the wrong pipe.

13:01.263 --> 13:04.391
I don't need to tell you. You grew up here.
You know what I'm talking about.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.297
I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Jack. Jack Randall.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.494
Hi.

13:09.071 --> 13:10.698
And you are?

13:11.740 --> 13:14.675
Culpepper. I'm Leslie Culpepper.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.778
Nice to meet you, Leslie.

13:25.454 --> 13:27.354
Would you mind
handing me that wrench?

13:27.490 --> 13:28.752
Sure.

13:29.758 --> 13:32.522
Here. There you go.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.861
- Those are pliers.
- Oh, right.

13:36.999 --> 13:40.526
- It's the red one in there.
- Yeah, right. Of course.

13:40.669 --> 13:43.399
- Oh, that's heavy.
- Thanks.

13:43.539 --> 13:46.702
I really like what you've done
with the kitchen. It's very homey.

13:46.842 --> 13:48.673
I bet you get a lot of cooking done
in here.

13:48.811 --> 13:51.678
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I do a lot of cooking.

13:51.814 --> 13:53.406
What's your specialty?

13:54.750 --> 13:58.117
I think it's probably frying.

13:58.521 --> 14:00.955
Yeah, I'm a pretty good fryer.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.455
Kitty?

14:03.626 --> 14:05.150
Kit.

14:07.496 --> 14:10.488
- I think you've got a visitor.
- Yeah, you know what? That's right.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.498
- It's my neighbor. It's my neighbor.
- Kitty.

14:12.635 --> 14:14.796
He's probably looking for his cat again.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.962
- Kit.
- I'll be right back.

14:22.478 --> 14:24.241
- There you are. Hi.
- Hi.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.439
Hi. Kevin, what are you doing here?

14:26.582 --> 14:29.346
I thought I'd check on you. What was
the plumbing emergency about?

14:29.485 --> 14:31.112
Oh, that's fine. No, that's totally fine.

14:31.253 --> 14:34.120
No, no. You're... It's all good.
It's all fine. It's good.

14:34.256 --> 14:35.416
Oh, okay, great.

14:35.558 --> 14:37.924
Well, you know how hard it is
to find this place?

14:38.060 --> 14:39.994
I've been driving around in circles
for an hour.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.656
Kevin, look, it's very, very sweet of you to
come all the way up here to check on me,

14:43.799 --> 14:46.290
but see, I'm trying to find myself.

14:46.435 --> 14:49.165
And I can't find myself
if everybody else is trying to find me too.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.000
- But I've just spent...
- No, buts. Sorry.

14:51.540 --> 14:55.067
Sorry. But I need you to take your GPS
and go back to wherever you came from.

14:55.210 --> 14:56.472
- Leslie?
- Are you?

14:57.046 --> 14:58.911
- What was that?
- What was what?

14:59.048 --> 15:00.447
- Someone said "Leslie."
- They did?

15:00.583 --> 15:02.107
- Kitty.
- What?

15:02.251 --> 15:04.583
There you are.
You're all set back there, Leslie.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.347
Okay, great. Thanks.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.115
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.656
You must be the neighbor.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.522
He is. He is. He's the neighbor.
Aren't you?

15:12.661 --> 15:13.958
I am.

15:14.096 --> 15:18.829
And sadly the neighbor, Kevin,
has to leave, right?

15:18.968 --> 15:22.131
No, no. I've got nowhere to go, Leslie.

15:22.571 --> 15:25.802
I hate that my face
is so disorganized now.

15:25.941 --> 15:30.435
It used to be so neat and sleek.
Everything in its proper place.

15:30.579 --> 15:33.275
Now my cheeks
are where my chin used to be.

15:33.415 --> 15:37.374
My chin is down with my neck.
It's just a mess.

15:37.519 --> 15:41.250
I feel like I've been hanging in the closet
too long.

15:41.390 --> 15:45.121
- Mom, this guy is really good.
- Well, that's what Celia says.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.557
She says he's a genius.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.822
No, Mom. He is an artist.
Check these out.

15:48.964 --> 15:52.661
See how they kind of point up
to the ceiling? Like a Michelangelo.

15:52.801 --> 15:54.860
They used to be called
champagne glasses.

15:55.804 --> 15:58.329
I had a pair like that
before all you kids were born.

15:58.474 --> 15:59.873
Kitty has them now.

16:00.009 --> 16:03.706
Well, Kitty might've got
the champagne glasses, but I got the jugs.

16:03.846 --> 16:07.646
Though lately they seem more
like a pair of old empty socks.

16:08.283 --> 16:11.548
Can we please look
at some pictures a little higher up?

16:11.687 --> 16:13.587
Okay. How about brow lift?

16:13.722 --> 16:16.452
Upper lid modification and contouring.

16:16.592 --> 16:20.084
Brow lift. I don't think I want
to look permanently petrified, do I?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.857
- No. Mom, that's not pretty.
- Maybe just mildly surprised.

16:22.998 --> 16:24.556
Mom, stop it. You're scaring me.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.561
I just wanna feel pretty, that's all.

16:29.872 --> 16:32.136
I miss the feeling
that when you walk by a man,

16:32.274 --> 16:34.538
maybe he'll turn around and look.

16:35.110 --> 16:38.546
When that's gone you just don't feel
like you exist anymore.

16:38.681 --> 16:41.047
Nowadays, if a man turns
and looks at me,

16:41.183 --> 16:43.708
it's usually to tell me
I left my car lights on.

16:43.852 --> 16:44.978
Oh, Mom.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.021
Which can be very helpful
because no one wants a dead battery.

16:49.158 --> 16:50.455
True.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.321
Biggest catfish I ever saw.

16:52.461 --> 16:54.759
So I says to Leslie,
"We'll have to take it home to cook."

16:54.897 --> 16:58.230
Right there she guts it, debones it,
fries it up in front of me.

16:58.367 --> 17:01.894
Damnedest thing I ever saw. But that's
just the way she rolls. Speaking of rolls...

17:02.037 --> 17:03.834
Kevin. Kevin, stop.

17:04.039 --> 17:05.836
We don't want to bore poor Jack.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.534
I should probably get my things anyway.

17:08.676 --> 17:10.372
I have another job to get to.

17:10.512 --> 17:11.979
You mind if I use your washroom?

17:12.114 --> 17:16.608
Oh, gosh. Not at all. Not at all.
It's right over there to the left.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.915
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

17:21.056 --> 17:23.148
- Yes. What are you doing?
- I'm not Leslie.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.817
Look, Kevin, that was an accident.
No, it was.

17:25.961 --> 17:29.397
He was going on and on about city people
who come here and ruin it for everybody.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.590
And he said that the politicians
were the worst.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.099
- Well...
- For some strange reason

17:33.235 --> 17:35.760
he didn't recognize me
and I didn't wanna embarrass the guy.

17:35.904 --> 17:40.364
Plus, I'm not so keen
on being myself right now, so fine, okay?

17:40.509 --> 17:43.069
It was a two bird, one stone
kind of thing.

17:43.212 --> 17:45.737
And the fact that he's smoking hot
has nothing to do with it.

17:45.881 --> 17:48.042
- What?
- Don't pretend like you haven't noticed.

17:48.183 --> 17:51.050
- I'm feeling the chemistry here.
- Oh, my God. You're insane.

17:51.186 --> 17:53.313
Kevin, I just buried my husband.

17:55.691 --> 18:00.958
Okay, Kit, besides you, there is no one
who misses Robert more than I do.

18:01.096 --> 18:04.623
But we both know
that he left us a long time ago.

18:04.767 --> 18:07.827
It is okay to think about the future.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.766
You might not know that,
but I think Leslie does.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.706
Okay, well, I'm out of here.
It was nice meeting you, Leslie.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.675
Oh, it was really nice
to meet you too, Jack.

18:17.813 --> 18:20.247
- Jack, what are you doing tonight?
- What are you?

18:20.382 --> 18:22.782
- Why do you ask?
- Leslie was gonna cook me dinner,

18:22.918 --> 18:25.819
but now I have a thing,
so she'll be all alone.

18:25.954 --> 18:27.945
- Kevin.
- A shame to waste all that good food.

18:28.090 --> 18:30.149
You know what? Don't listen to him.
He's medicated.

18:30.292 --> 18:32.658
No, he's right, it would be a shame.

18:34.830 --> 18:36.627
Well, okay.

18:36.765 --> 18:40.496
Okay, well, okay, do you wanna
come back and have dinner with me later?

18:40.636 --> 18:43.230
Sure. I'll bring a bottle of wine.
What are you cooking?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.273
Yeah, Leslie. What are you cooking?

18:47.009 --> 18:48.977
- A soufflé.
- Great.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.841
- Eight o'clock, okay?
- Eight would be great.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.413
- I'll see you then.
- Okay.

18:55.317 --> 18:57.979
- Eight would be great?
- Well...

19:03.425 --> 19:06.485
- Justin.
- Hey. I'm running a little late.

19:06.628 --> 19:07.925
We have a party to go to.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.123
I know. Five more minutes
and then I'll jump in the shower, all right?

19:12.167 --> 19:13.691
Feels good to paint this a new color.

19:13.836 --> 19:16.361
- What was wrong with the old color?
- Rebecca picked it out.

19:17.973 --> 19:20.999
This one's called Elephant Ear.
What do you think? Is it different enough?

19:22.311 --> 19:25.644
If not, I think I have one here,
Rainy Sundays.

19:25.781 --> 19:27.408
- That's a little depressing.
- Excuse me.

19:27.549 --> 19:29.983
Would you tell me
what's going on, please?

19:32.654 --> 19:34.588
Rebecca was here.

19:35.390 --> 19:38.325
- Okay, when?
- A couple of hours ago.

19:39.628 --> 19:41.789
- She didn't even come in.
- Come on, give her a break.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.127
- I mean, she probably was scared.
- No, I know she was scared.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.565
Believe me,
I've had that same look on my face.

19:47.703 --> 19:49.728
When you're staring at something
you can't have,

19:49.872 --> 19:52.272
but you have to remind yourself
to resist it. L...

19:52.407 --> 19:55.376
- It was like a test. She...
- I'm sorry, Justin.

19:56.078 --> 19:57.773
I hate being in this place to begin with

19:57.913 --> 20:01.076
and now all I see is her
standing at the door.

20:03.185 --> 20:04.447
Look, I've changed, Saul.

20:04.686 --> 20:07.917
The whole family keeps telling me that,
so why won't she give me a chance?

20:08.056 --> 20:10.991
- Why can't she see that?
- Well, maybe she will.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.856
Or maybe you won't need her to.

20:13.996 --> 20:15.486
These things take time.

20:16.198 --> 20:17.495
I tell you, I do know this.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.191
One day you're gonna wake up
and not even remember

20:20.335 --> 20:21.893
what color these walls were.

20:22.037 --> 20:25.302
It'll be just like they were Elephant Ear
all along.

20:28.777 --> 20:31.075
I wish it were that simple.

20:35.517 --> 20:36.677
She'll be out in a minute.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.447
Are you sure this is a good idea?

20:40.589 --> 20:43.490
I mean, the last time I saw her,
it was like we were complete strangers.

20:43.625 --> 20:46.594
Well, she's been asking about you
every day for the last week.

20:46.728 --> 20:49.162
I don't know if it's because
she's starting to remember you

20:49.298 --> 20:52.199
or if she's just remembering the things
we told her about you, but...

20:52.334 --> 20:55.792
- That's a big difference.
- Yeah, well, we can hope.

20:55.938 --> 20:59.305
Otherwise, you'll start from the beginning.
You know, build new memories.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.577
- What should we talk about?
- Start simple.

21:04.713 --> 21:06.943
Talk about things
from when you were young.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.076
- Dance class, maybe?
- Ballet class?

21:11.920 --> 21:14.980
Hi, Rebecca. You're here.

21:15.657 --> 21:17.386
Mom. Hi.

21:17.793 --> 21:19.124
Hi.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.196
This is such a special occasion and
I wanna thank Scotty for making it perfect.

21:32.341 --> 21:34.639
- Yeah. Well, anything for the birthday girl.
- Thank you.

21:34.776 --> 21:37.768
And Kitty really wanted to be here,
but she's got a lot going on up in Ojai.

21:37.913 --> 21:42.714
Actually, it's nice just to have
a small intimate celebration.

21:42.851 --> 21:44.910
It's good. I like it.

21:45.053 --> 21:50.252
I'm going to get the next course. Luc,
would you mind helping me in the kitchen?

21:50.392 --> 21:53.520
Of course. We'll be right back.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.797
I cannot believe you're pulling this off.

22:04.940 --> 22:07.170
You're such a good liar.
She'd have made a great lawyer.

22:07.309 --> 22:10.608
Sarah, this is ridiculous. You have
to tell him the truth about your age.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.909
I will, Mom. I will. When I'm 80.

22:14.049 --> 22:16.813
Well, maybe next year
I'll have my 30th, what do you think?

22:20.055 --> 22:22.353
- Oh, it's Kitty.
- Oh, I'm so glad she didn't come.

22:22.491 --> 22:24.459
She would never have been able
to keep her mouth...

22:24.593 --> 22:26.356
- Hi, Kit.
- Kevin, this is all your fault.

22:26.495 --> 22:28.588
I can't tell whether the stupid thing
is done or not.

22:28.730 --> 22:31.290
I'm not allowed to open the oven.
I mean, you come up here

22:31.433 --> 22:33.333
and you start filling my head
with this stuff.

22:33.468 --> 22:35.231
I'm putting you on speaker phone.

22:35.370 --> 22:38.771
And now I'm having dinner with some
lumberjack that I don't even know.

22:38.907 --> 22:41.432
- Okay, slow down.
- Why did I say I was gonna make soufflé?

22:41.576 --> 22:43.043
I could've made a chicken.

22:43.178 --> 22:46.113
Because it's perfect. Come on. Relax.
How hard can a soufflé be?

22:46.248 --> 22:47.943
- Give me that.
- Okay?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.315
- It's okay, honey. I'm here.
- How do you know

22:50.452 --> 22:52.386
- when a soufflé is finished?
- She's cooking.

22:52.521 --> 22:54.421
Well, I don't know.
What time did you put it in?

22:54.556 --> 22:57.719
Oh, God. I don't know.
What, like three Chardonnays ago?

22:57.859 --> 23:00.885
- Well, that could be the problem.
- Okay, why is Kitty cooking?

23:01.029 --> 23:04.624
She's changing it up, getting out
of her comfort zone. It's good for her.

23:04.766 --> 23:08.258
Speaking of changing it up, you'll never
believe where Mom and I went today.

23:08.403 --> 23:10.462
- Where?
- Plastic surgeon.

23:11.339 --> 23:12.966
You're kidding.
I wanna get my eyes done.

23:13.108 --> 23:14.803
- Yeah? For real?
- Yeah. Which surgeon?

23:14.943 --> 23:18.470
- Oh, he was...
- Sarah. That was our secret.

23:18.613 --> 23:22.344
Secret? Well, why do you have a secret
with Sarah?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.645
- Well, it's only Kevin, Mom.
- Yeah.

23:24.786 --> 23:27.846
Stop it. Now stop it, Sarah.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.355
- I told you that it was private.
- <i>Private?</i>

23:30.492 --> 23:31.823
Are you trying to embarrass me?

23:31.960 --> 23:34.895
No. Not at all.
I really didn't think it was such a big deal.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.430
You know, this isn't fair.
I always miss all the good stuff.

23:37.566 --> 23:39.761
Kitty, focus. Focus. All right.

23:40.302 --> 23:41.394
Kitty, now listen.

23:41.536 --> 23:44.437
Did you beat the egg whites
until they were stiff?

23:44.573 --> 23:46.507
No, Mother,
I beat them until they were dead.

23:46.975 --> 23:50.308
Well, then,
I think you should just take it out.

23:50.445 --> 23:51.878
Really?

23:52.781 --> 23:54.976
Okay. Okay, I can do that.

23:55.117 --> 23:56.982
<i>I can do that. Here I go. I'm taking it out.</i>

23:57.119 --> 24:01.351
I'm taking it out. Okay. Okay.

24:01.490 --> 24:03.117
Okay. Okay, easy does it.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.885
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Mom.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.054
Mom, this is the fluffiest,
most beautiful thing

24:10.198 --> 24:13.497
I have ever seen in my entire life.

24:13.635 --> 24:16.729
- Oh, honey. You did it.
- <i>I made a soufflé.</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:20.273
I'm a soufflé maker. I did it. L...

24:20.742 --> 24:22.642
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

24:22.777 --> 24:25.211
Oh, my God. Mom.
Mom, something is happening.

24:25.347 --> 24:28.441
Something very weird is happening.
It's dying.

24:28.583 --> 24:29.777
Oh, no. It's melting.

24:29.918 --> 24:32.614
- Oh, no.
- What? Is it... Okay. Okay.

24:32.754 --> 24:34.915
Okay, that's fine.
But how do I make it stop?

24:35.056 --> 24:36.523
I'm sorry, honey. You can't.

24:37.092 --> 24:39.219
- Leslie?
- Jack.

24:39.361 --> 24:40.760
- <i>Who's Jack?</i>
- Can I come in?

24:40.896 --> 24:43.296
- You're early.
- <i>Who's early? Jack?</i>

24:43.431 --> 24:45.922
<i>Who's Jack? Honey, who's there?</i>

24:46.067 --> 24:48.160
<i>Kitty, are you there?</i>

24:48.837 --> 24:50.600
<i>Kitty? Kit?</i>

24:51.373 --> 24:55.537
- Your neighbor still looking for that cat?
- Yeah.

24:56.144 --> 24:57.839
Yeah, it... Yeah, is that...

24:57.979 --> 25:05.249
Yeah, you haven't seen a sort of a cat
named Kitty?

25:07.022 --> 25:10.753
- Everything okay in here?
- Well, yeah.

25:10.892 --> 25:14.225
Yeah, of course. Why?
Everything's fine.

25:16.831 --> 25:18.025
Okay.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.760
Okay. You know what?
No. No, everything is not fine.

25:20.902 --> 25:22.563
Everything is so not fine.

25:22.704 --> 25:25.036
Wanna know something?
I don't know how to make a soufflé.

25:25.173 --> 25:28.802
Know something else? I don't know how to
work the coffee pot, if you can believe that.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.777
- Oh, I believe it.
- Oh, you know what else? I don't live here.

25:31.913 --> 25:33.574
Okay? I don't own this house.

25:33.715 --> 25:36.081
I'm just one of the renters from the city
that you hate.

25:36.218 --> 25:41.281
I came up here to find myself,
like some sort of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> thing.

25:41.423 --> 25:43.448
But now I've dragged you
into the whole thing.

25:43.592 --> 25:45.457
Oh, right. And my name isn't Leslie.

25:45.594 --> 25:47.619
My name is Kitty.
Kitty Walker-McCallister.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.261
Politician, right? The...

25:51.399 --> 25:52.661
I knew you looked familiar.

25:52.801 --> 25:56.760
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry I misrepresented myself.

25:56.905 --> 26:00.864
- Classic politician move, by the way.
- Okay, fine. Right. You're right.

26:01.009 --> 26:04.968
You're right. You know what?
You don't have to stick around for this.

26:05.113 --> 26:07.809
Just... I'm just gonna clean up.

26:07.949 --> 26:09.917
Are you sure?
Because I don't mind helping out.

26:10.051 --> 26:12.315
Jack. Jack. You know what?
Please. Please. Okay?

26:12.454 --> 26:14.285
You know what? I gave it a shot. I did.

26:14.422 --> 26:17.255
I gave it a shot and it just collapsed
and that's okay.

26:17.392 --> 26:19.860
You know, what are you gonna do?
But you know what?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.987
I have completely
humiliated myself enough,

26:23.131 --> 26:27.067
so I would really appreciate it
if you could just leave.

26:28.236 --> 26:30.363
Okay? Hurry up before the bugs get in.

26:31.406 --> 26:35.206
Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you around.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.573
Yeah. See you around.

26:41.283 --> 26:43.342
Come on, Mom.
I already said I was sorry.

26:45.587 --> 26:48.055
Nope. Don't think she's talking to you.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.521
Listen, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

26:50.659 --> 26:53.685
Everyone gets plastic surgery done
these days. She...

26:53.828 --> 26:56.592
Sarah. God, would you
keep your voice down?

26:56.731 --> 26:59.666
Do you have to tell the whole restaurant?
It's bad enough you told Kevin.

26:59.801 --> 27:03.498
- I'm not judging.
- Mom, it's no big deal. I mean, it's funny.

27:03.638 --> 27:06.436
Well, I'm glad you thought it was funny,
Miss 40-Something

27:06.574 --> 27:09.668
with a model boyfriend, but in case
you hadn't noticed, I'm not laughing.

27:09.811 --> 27:12.211
Look, Mom,
I don't mean to be insensitive.

27:12.347 --> 27:15.748
- One day I'll be as old as you.
- Well, that's fine, but you're not now.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.146
It's embarrassing and humiliating
to be an older woman

27:20.288 --> 27:23.587
in this country where everything
of value is young and new.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.592
And I, very clearly, am not.

27:27.095 --> 27:29.359
- Oh, sorry we're late.
- Hey.

27:29.497 --> 27:31.260
My God.
What are you guys doing here?

27:31.399 --> 27:33.924
- I thought you couldn't make it.
- No. It's my fault. Sorry.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.832
I got caught up and I hijacked Saul.

27:35.970 --> 27:37.437
- Rebecca stopped by.
- Saul.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.767
- Are you two getting back together?
- No. We're not.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.139
Justin, wait, stop. Give her some time.

27:43.278 --> 27:45.746
- Is she still mad?
- Yes, Mom, she's still mad at me.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.507
Could you sit down together,
apologize...

27:47.649 --> 27:49.879
This is not something
we can work out with an apology,

27:50.018 --> 27:51.508
- so let's just drop it.
- Okay.

27:51.653 --> 27:53.245
What? Justin, that would be a start.

27:53.388 --> 27:55.720
Look, sweetheart,
you have to talk all of this out.

27:55.857 --> 27:57.722
- That's what you have to do.
- Mom.

27:57.859 --> 28:00.054
- Honestly, she'll come back...
- No, she won't, Mom.

28:00.195 --> 28:03.096
- Well, how do you know that?
- Because we're divorced. We're divorced.

28:03.231 --> 28:06.928
Look, she filed for the papers while I
was in Afghanistan. It's over. So drop it.

28:07.068 --> 28:09.502
- Oh, my God.
- Justin, I'm so sorry.

28:09.637 --> 28:11.127
- Just drop it.
- You guys made it.

28:11.272 --> 28:14.070
Perfect timing because...

28:14.209 --> 28:15.471
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.272
Before we sing,
there is just one thing I wanna say.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.644
All right, Sarah.

28:25.086 --> 28:30.490
In English, "There's only one happiness
in life, is to love and be loved."

28:36.564 --> 28:38.623
Wait, 40? Yeah, right, Sarah.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.530
Like, 30 years ago.

28:40.668 --> 28:42.568
Oh, Justin.

28:49.377 --> 28:53.473
- Have I been talking too much?
- No, no, go on. I love listening.

28:54.048 --> 28:57.711
Okay. Well, these were the people
that when I started working there,

28:57.852 --> 28:59.444
wouldn't even listen to my opinion.

28:59.587 --> 29:01.851
Yeah, remember how excited you were
when she got the job?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.322
It was like they had
this preconceived notion

29:04.459 --> 29:06.620
of who I am because I happen
to be young and female.

29:06.761 --> 29:09.423
Oh, I know how that feels. Trust me.

29:09.564 --> 29:13.796
Right. So I was just really excited
when they finally got it

29:13.935 --> 29:16.028
and they started to listen.

29:16.171 --> 29:20.005
You must be really proud of yourself.
I am.

29:22.811 --> 29:25.279
Why don't I leave the two of you alone
for a bit?

29:25.413 --> 29:27.142
- Is that okay?
- Oh, yeah, it's fine.

29:27.282 --> 29:29.716
- I'll just be in the other room.
- Okay.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.857
You don't know how nice this is
just sitting here with you.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.487
It is nice.

29:46.601 --> 29:49.832
This may seem silly,
but, you know, when I was a little girl,

29:49.971 --> 29:52.940
I used to go to these dance classes
on Sundays.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.800
Ballet.

29:55.610 --> 29:57.908
Yes. Yes. Ballet.

30:04.085 --> 30:07.851
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, no. Don't worry. I'm fine.

30:07.989 --> 30:10.958
I didn't realize how much I missed this.

30:11.092 --> 30:13.890
You know, all year I just wanted
to sit with my mom.

30:15.430 --> 30:18.695
Talk about anything,
even if it is a stupid ballet class.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.063
Honey, it's okay.

30:21.202 --> 30:24.103
I am sure you'll find your mother.

30:28.309 --> 30:30.368
What? What did I say?

30:30.512 --> 30:32.810
No, nothing. I just... I'm sorry.
I just thought...

30:32.947 --> 30:35.916
No, no. I upset you.
I mean, look at you, you're crying.

30:36.050 --> 30:38.712
- No, I'm... Mom, I'm fine.
- Why are you calling me that?

30:38.853 --> 30:41.048
I'm sorry,
but I still don't quite understand.

30:41.189 --> 30:43.487
I know I should, but I...

30:43.625 --> 30:44.819
Oh, my God.

30:44.959 --> 30:49.225
- David? No. I'm not really doing so well.
- Holly, I'm your daughter, Rebecca.

30:49.364 --> 30:51.264
I'm a little tired.
David, what is going on?

30:51.566 --> 30:54.262
- I knew this would happen.
- That's Rebecca, Holly. Remember?

30:54.402 --> 30:57.098
- I showed you the pictures.
- Stop. She doesn't remember who I am.

30:57.238 --> 31:00.901
- No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
- Rebecca, wait a minute. Wait.

31:01.042 --> 31:02.942
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

31:03.077 --> 31:06.672
No, Holly, it's okay. It's all right.
Come here.

31:07.015 --> 31:11.384
It's okay. It's not your fault.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.980
Oh, God, I need a drink.

31:16.124 --> 31:20.060
- Stop laughing at me, you.
- I'm sorry. I think it's funny.

31:20.495 --> 31:22.258
I never meant for it to go on so long.

31:22.397 --> 31:25.628
I honestly didn't think we'd be spending
a whole lot of birthdays together.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.735
- Why not?
- I don't know.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.429
A girl like me, a boy like you.

31:30.572 --> 31:33.405
Excuse me, may I have a whiskey?

31:33.541 --> 31:35.008
- And make it a double.
- Sure thing.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.270
- Make it two, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

31:37.412 --> 31:41.109
Sarah, I know how old you are.
I've always known.

31:41.449 --> 31:44.384
- What do you mean you've known?
- You do have a driver's license.

31:44.519 --> 31:47.215
Oh, no. Luc.

31:47.355 --> 31:49.550
God, why didn't you tell me?

31:49.691 --> 31:52.626
I'm sorry, but in France,
we just don't talk about women's age.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.852
- Not nice.
- So depressing.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.690
So I thought I would play along.

31:56.831 --> 32:00.699
And I didn't know Scotty would write it
on the cake, so sorry.

32:02.737 --> 32:04.261
To you.

32:08.910 --> 32:11.378
Okay, now I can go home.

32:11.679 --> 32:16.207
Come on, Junior. It's past my bedtime.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.378
Leslie?

32:20.521 --> 32:21.988
I mean, Kitty.

32:22.123 --> 32:26.753
Oh, God. Oh, God. Not you again.

32:33.134 --> 32:34.829
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.096
I was just grabbing a pizza
down the road

32:37.238 --> 32:40.503
and I thought, well, she's not gonna eat
that mess. No offense.

32:40.642 --> 32:41.836
- None taken.
- You hungry?

32:42.710 --> 32:44.473
I'm starving.

32:44.612 --> 32:47.945
Wow, look at what you did. That is...
But you know what?

32:48.082 --> 32:50.107
You didn't have to do this.
You really didn't.

32:50.251 --> 32:53.414
You don't have to take pity on me.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.215
Who said it was pity?

32:55.356 --> 32:57.085
Well, thank you.

32:57.759 --> 33:01.456
Oh, you know, I opened up that wine.

33:01.596 --> 33:04.565
- Would you like some?
- Yeah, sure.

33:04.699 --> 33:06.792
Yeah. So I'm sorry.

33:06.934 --> 33:10.461
Sorry about the whole identity thing.
It just...

33:10.605 --> 33:15.941
I mean, well, yes, in retrospect,
it seems pretty crazy.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.443
Well, I don't think what you're doing
is crazy at all.

33:18.579 --> 33:21.446
I mean, the whole lying
about your name thing, okay,

33:21.582 --> 33:26.281
but trying to be someone new?
Reinventing yourself?

33:26.421 --> 33:28.719
- That's kind of great.
- Really?

33:28.856 --> 33:32.656
Most people don't have the guts
to just take off. Start over.

33:32.794 --> 33:34.694
I respect that.

33:35.897 --> 33:39.628
Well, do you ever feel
that sometimes you missed out

33:39.767 --> 33:41.257
on being who you were supposed to be

33:41.402 --> 33:44.667
because you're so busy
being who everybody expected you to be?

33:45.006 --> 33:47.304
Yeah. I used to.

33:49.877 --> 33:51.606
Thank you.

33:52.714 --> 33:55.239
Well, I guess it's just time for me
to try to figure out

33:55.383 --> 33:57.408
who I was supposed to be after all.

33:57.885 --> 34:00.410
May I make a suggestion?

34:01.122 --> 34:04.023
- Let's cross chef off the list.
- Done.

34:04.358 --> 34:05.916
You happen to have any interest

34:06.060 --> 34:08.858
- in carpentry?
- Carpentry?

34:09.097 --> 34:10.996
Well, I'm supposed to build a pergola
tomorrow

34:11.132 --> 34:13.100
and you're welcome to come along
if you'd like.

34:14.936 --> 34:18.770
You really think that I would be able
to build a pergola?

34:18.906 --> 34:21.466
No, but then we could at least
cross that off the list too.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.870
Oh, I see. You're a comedian.
Very funny.

34:26.013 --> 34:29.779
He didn't tell us? Not at all?
All that time he just didn't say anything?

34:29.917 --> 34:33.751
Well, I think he was probably ashamed.

34:33.888 --> 34:36.789
Also, I think he felt
that he could get Rebecca back

34:36.924 --> 34:38.891
and then nobody would ever
have to know.

34:39.025 --> 34:41.755
But he tried so hard.
These things happen.

34:41.896 --> 34:45.422
- He had nothing to be ashamed of.
- Yes, I agree.

34:46.067 --> 34:48.864
And neither do you, I might add.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.061
What does that mean?

34:50.204 --> 34:53.696
Look, I heard what you all
were talking about when I walked in.

34:53.841 --> 34:57.834
God. Okay, I went
to see a plastic surgeon.

34:57.979 --> 35:03.349
- Why, Nora? That's not like you.
- I don't know. I just feel...

35:04.752 --> 35:08.210
I met William when I was so young.

35:08.790 --> 35:12.157
It'd be one thing if I had a partner now
who'd known me when I was young

35:12.293 --> 35:15.194
and we just grew old together.

35:15.329 --> 35:19.060
Someone who looks at me
and still sees the girl I once was.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.364
Who looks at the folds in my neck
and the puckers and bags

35:23.504 --> 35:27.031
with a kind of endearment.

35:27.175 --> 35:29.973
Because we'd gone
through life together.

35:31.078 --> 35:32.602
And that I don't have.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.239
I think you're lonely, sweetheart.

35:35.383 --> 35:39.752
And rearranging your face
is certainly not gonna change that.

35:46.994 --> 35:48.757
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:49.330 --> 35:51.389
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

35:52.033 --> 35:53.227
Well, come in.

36:01.008 --> 36:03.841
- Here.
- Thank you.

36:09.684 --> 36:11.049
I like the gray. It's nice.

36:11.185 --> 36:12.482
Yeah?

36:12.620 --> 36:16.215
It was gonna be Rainy Sunday.
The color of the paint.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.420
She was looking right at me, Justin.
She had no idea who I was.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.498
I just can't believe this is happening.

36:28.636 --> 36:30.570
You know,
I thought she might be getting better.

36:30.705 --> 36:33.037
Hey, Rebecca, look. You can't give up.

36:33.174 --> 36:34.835
All right? You can't give up.

36:34.976 --> 36:40.175
- I already lost you. I can't lose her too.
- No, no. You're not losing anybody.

36:43.251 --> 36:46.186
- I can't. I can't do this. I can't.
- Rebecca.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.811
Justin, we're divorced.
I can't be here with you like this.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.480
- Why not?
- It'll feel too comfortable

36:50.625 --> 36:52.957
and it'll feel too good
and I'll wanna stay forever.

36:53.094 --> 36:56.086
- What's wrong with that?
- I can't trust you, Justin.

36:57.164 --> 36:59.758
Rebecca, I'm a different guy
than I was last year.

36:59.901 --> 37:01.994
- How do I know that?
- You don't.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.468
You don't.
But you can let me prove it to you.

37:05.907 --> 37:07.670
- Justin.
- Okay, Rebecca,

37:07.808 --> 37:10.902
you wanna know why I haven't told anyone
about the divorce?

37:11.045 --> 37:12.273
Because you haven't either.

37:14.181 --> 37:16.706
I know you haven't given up on us.

37:20.288 --> 37:22.483
It's late. I should go home.

37:22.623 --> 37:25.956
Rebecca, you are home.

37:53.988 --> 37:55.216
Here. Some water.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.620
Oh, no, thanks. I already got some.

37:57.758 --> 37:58.816
No, for your dentures.

38:00.861 --> 38:04.627
Luc. Oh, you are so mean.

38:04.765 --> 38:08.861
I can't believe you knew this whole time.
It is such an embarrassment.

38:11.005 --> 38:14.907
Of course I knew.
Why are you so surprised?

38:15.276 --> 38:17.836
I don't know. I just had an irrational fear

38:17.979 --> 38:22.040
that if you found out
how much older I really was,

38:22.183 --> 38:26.586
then you might not want me anymore.

38:27.655 --> 38:31.386
- Why wouldn't I?
- Come on, honey. It's all great now.

38:31.525 --> 38:34.187
What about in 20 years time?

38:34.495 --> 38:36.963
Are you gonna still like older women
when I'm 60?

38:37.098 --> 38:40.431
I don't care how old you are.
It's you that I love.

38:43.838 --> 38:46.568
Luc, what if you change your mind?

38:46.707 --> 38:50.336
You decide you wanna have kids,
a family of your own.

38:50.711 --> 38:52.303
I won't be able to give you that.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.744
You already have.

38:58.052 --> 39:00.077
You are my family.

39:00.321 --> 39:02.983
Paige and Cooper,
they've become my family.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.353
I meant what I said tonight.

39:05.493 --> 39:08.519
The most important thing in life
is to be loved.

39:09.563 --> 39:11.394
Do you love me?

39:17.538 --> 39:19.938
Oh, my goodness.
Would you look at that?

39:20.074 --> 39:25.102
Oh, my goodness, Evan. Look at that.
Look at that. They're perfect.

39:25.246 --> 39:28.374
They're perfect.
I'm telling you, you're gonna love these.

39:28.516 --> 39:33.385
Okay, these were my favorite,
favorite buns when I was a little girl.

39:33.521 --> 39:35.989
Okay, I'm gonna teach you
something very special.

39:36.123 --> 39:39.251
This is what we call the drizzle.

39:39.393 --> 39:41.190
Okay, are you ready?
You see... You wanna try?

39:41.962 --> 39:44.487
You want Momma to drizzle?
Okay, watch.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.894
Watch it go. Here it comes.

39:46.033 --> 39:50.094
Drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.

39:51.572 --> 39:53.267
Yummy.

39:53.841 --> 39:56.036
Yeah. There you go, buddy.

39:56.177 --> 39:58.372
So here's the thing.
Remember that we did this

39:58.512 --> 40:00.639
- all by ourselves, okay?
- Okay.

40:00.781 --> 40:04.217
And we're never gonna tell anybody
that it came out of a can.

40:04.351 --> 40:06.478
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it?

40:06.620 --> 40:09.555
- Yeah.
- Pinky swear. Yeah.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.553
- Good morning, Zoe.
- Nora, you're late.

40:16.097 --> 40:18.827
- No, I'm not.
- I told you to come in a half an hour early.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.267
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

40:21.402 --> 40:23.029
Maybe next time
you should write it down.

40:23.537 --> 40:26.131
Nora, there's a truck out back.
I want you to unload the zinnias.

40:26.273 --> 40:28.935
Ask the guys to help you
if you can't manage it on your own.

40:32.046 --> 40:34.173
You know what? No.

40:35.816 --> 40:37.374
What?

40:37.852 --> 40:39.251
I quit, Zoe.

40:40.788 --> 40:43.621
- I thought you needed a job.
- Yes, I do need a job.

40:43.757 --> 40:45.691
But not one where I'm treated like this.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.825
Well, good luck finding a job
in this economy and at your age.

40:51.265 --> 40:52.994
- My what?
- Come on, Nora. Let's be honest.

40:53.134 --> 40:55.500
You were lucky I gave you this job.
No one's gonna hire you.

40:55.636 --> 40:56.830
And why is that, Zoe?

40:56.971 --> 41:00.839
Because I'm 63 years old
and look every blessed day of it?

41:00.975 --> 41:03.500
Is that it? Well, I'm just fine with that

41:03.644 --> 41:07.842
because every baby I ever had,
every kiss I gave or got,

41:07.982 --> 41:10.780
every tear, every glass of wine
is right here on my face.

41:10.918 --> 41:12.579
I own it, it's who I am.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.381
And I don't wanna be somebody else.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.589
You know what? I don't have to be.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.354
Because somewhere out there,
there is a job for me

41:21.495 --> 41:24.396
where my experience will be valued
and appreciated.

41:24.532 --> 41:28.229
So, Zoe, I quit.

41:31.972 --> 41:33.200
I'll be taking these with me.

41:33.340 --> 41:37.003
You can take them out
of my next and last paycheck.

41:40.714 --> 41:42.375
Holly?

41:42.516 --> 41:44.507
Holly, are you here?

41:47.054 --> 41:48.988
Holly.

41:58.832 --> 42:00.299
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

42:00.434 --> 42:02.732
I have to report a missing person.

42:02.870 --> 42:06.465
- <i>What's the person's name, sir?</i>
- Holly. Holly Harper.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.269
She's been missing since last night.
