WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.104
("23" by Blonde Redhead playing)

00:11.879 --> 00:19.853
* 23 seconds

00:19.887 --> 00:22.690
* All things

00:22.723 --> 00:26.694
* We love will die

00:28.629 --> 00:29.863
Hey, there.

00:29.897 --> 00:35.936
* 23 magic

00:35.969 --> 00:38.939
* If you

00:38.972 --> 00:43.111
* Can change your life

00:43.144 --> 00:45.146
* Your tainted heart

00:45.179 --> 00:47.115
* Your tainted heart *

00:47.148 --> 00:49.817
* My tainted love

00:49.850 --> 00:51.919
* My tainted love *

00:51.952 --> 00:55.689
* Repent now

00:55.723 --> 00:57.825
You look pretty tonight.

00:57.858 --> 00:58.826
All for you.

00:58.859 --> 00:59.960
(both chuckle)

00:59.993 --> 01:03.030
* As long as you live

01:03.063 --> 01:06.767
* How many times

01:06.800 --> 01:12.806
* Will the world go round?

01:12.840 --> 01:15.243
* La, la, la, la,
la, la, la *

01:15.276 --> 01:19.380
* La, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la *

01:19.413 --> 01:23.117
* La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la *

01:23.151 --> 01:27.121
* La, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la *

01:27.155 --> 01:28.289
(giggles)

01:29.290 --> 01:32.059
* He was a friend of mine

01:32.092 --> 01:34.862
* Son of God

01:34.895 --> 01:38.098
* He was son of God

01:38.132 --> 01:39.099
(door closes)

01:39.133 --> 01:41.001
* He was son of God.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.103
(man grunting, clattering)

01:46.474 --> 01:48.242
(music fades)

01:48.276 --> 01:50.744
CHARLIE: Should I be worried
about a cloning expert

01:50.778 --> 01:52.980
feeding my fish... spice?

01:53.013 --> 01:56.750
Yep. I've laced their food
with carotenoid-rich paprika.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.487
The genetically prone ones are
going to become a brilliant red.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.390
If the poor things
don't die of indigestion first.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.791
Well, vermillion pigmentation

02:03.824 --> 02:05.859
is not really an evolutionary
advantage in carp.

02:05.893 --> 02:09.163
But the bold color is going
to attract the ladies.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.131
Hey, guys.
Come on back in.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.500
Halftime's almost over.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.101
Ugh, football.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.135
Survival of the witless.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.870
Yeah. Substitution for war.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.105
Yeah.
(motorcycle approaching)

02:18.138 --> 02:19.673
It's a good way to spend
a Sunday afternoon.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.009
Is that Donnie?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.911
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, hey!

02:23.944 --> 02:24.912
What's the score?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.347
It's all tied up. Come on.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.348
(chuckles):
Hey!

02:27.381 --> 02:29.783
A Moto Guzzi Griso 1100.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.118
Not too shabby.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.320
Thanks.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.188
I mean, it's no Harley, but...

02:34.222 --> 02:35.423
- You have a motorcycle?
- I do. I do.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.858
I got a 1969 FLH Electra Glide.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.193
- Yeah?
- You know, it sounds like

02:39.227 --> 02:40.894
- your air filter's clogged.
- Yeah, I know.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.196
- I got to take it in.
- Ah!

02:42.230 --> 02:43.431
Don't do that.
What's the use

02:43.464 --> 02:45.266
in owning a bike
if you can't tinker?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.734
- Hold on. What are you doing?
- Let's head inside.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.802
- Halftime's over.
- Give me a sec, give me a sec.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.338
You know what you're doing?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.373
Yes! I'm in a riding club.
(cell phone ringing)

02:52.406 --> 02:54.007
I mean, it's mostly
monster Harleys,

02:54.041 --> 02:55.576
but we got a few
Italian jobs like this.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.144
Yeah, I mean,
don't mess it up.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.246
Charlie, keep an eye on him.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.747
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Eppes.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.651
He should really invest
in some Moto Guzzi wrenches.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.386
Motorcycle riding club?

03:05.419 --> 03:06.954
Yep.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.557
In what other scenario

03:09.590 --> 03:12.860
can you wear leather chaps
in public?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.995
Uh, rodeo.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.997
- Hey, I got to go.
- Rodeo?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.366
Thing at the Wilshire
Westside Towers.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.800
- Another one?
- Yeah.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.001
All right, well, uh...

03:21.034 --> 03:22.503
should I ride with you?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.238
Why don't you just relax,
and I'll call you

03:24.272 --> 03:25.306
if there's anything, all right?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.207
- That's cool.
- Tell Dad, though.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.377
(engine revving)

03:29.410 --> 03:31.211
Another what?
What happened?

03:31.245 --> 03:33.814
Oh, um,
somebody's been killing men

03:33.847 --> 03:36.917
who, uh, sleep with prostitutes.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.454
Really?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.791
(indistinct radio transmissions)

03:45.893 --> 03:48.161
Victim number five.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.330
Edward Zurlanski.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.898
Strangled,
just like all the others.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.065
No sign of forced entry.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.534
We clear?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.537
So, the couple slept in here
last night.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.871
I mean, right on top
of the poor sucker.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.307
Yeah, complained
about the smell.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.474
Hotel cleaned the room twice

04:00.508 --> 04:02.142
before they found him.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.377
He's been dead for how long?

04:03.411 --> 04:04.878
Roughly 36 hours.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.647
He never actually checked out.
The room was empty

04:06.680 --> 04:08.482
and his car was no longer
at the valet,

04:08.516 --> 04:10.017
so the hotel just
charged his credit card.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.152
Yeah. Wallet's missing,
just like in the other cases.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.288
The hotel says Zurlanski's
from Chicago.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.290
Uh, rental car
hasn't been returned.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.427
Burn on his right palm,
same as the others.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
Yeah, and the same
women's underwear.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.262
All right, what do we know
about his Friday night?

04:22.296 --> 04:23.464
We're getting
the security camera footage,

04:23.497 --> 04:26.500
but witnesses put him
with a known call girl

04:26.534 --> 04:28.502
in the bar at about 10:00.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.971
- So, the pattern holds.
- Yep.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
Guy takes a hooker
up to his room on Friday night,

04:32.973 --> 04:34.141
ends up dead, hidden in a bed,

04:34.174 --> 04:36.209
discovered a few days later.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.911
Which gives the killer
some nice lead time.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.280
All right, let's get the coroner
on it right away.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.249
Body's our best bet for DNA.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.451
Right, seeing as how
everything in the room

04:43.484 --> 04:44.452
has been wiped clean.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.986
Yeah. Let's find that call girl.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.789
Since his car's a rental,
I can go activate the GPS.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.123
This could be our break.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.224
Last four murders,

04:51.258 --> 04:52.893
we didn't find the body
until Monday

04:52.926 --> 04:54.061
and the car was already ditched.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.264
I'm thinking the killer does
his dirty work on the weekends

04:57.297 --> 04:58.499
because he's got a regular job.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.700
Since it's still Sunday,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.502
- maybe he feels safe.
- So we got a few hours

05:01.535 --> 05:03.937
before he fades back
into everyday life.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.238
WOMAN:
My brother is in there.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.740
MAN:
No, I can't let you in.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.076
I have a right to see him.
You have...

05:09.109 --> 05:10.110
Can I help you?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.278
Yeah. That's my brother.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.846
Edward Zurlanski.
That's my brother.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.248
I don't want him left alone
with strangers.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.249
Okay, I understand.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.685
His remains must be respected.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.454
We are gonna get him
out of here as soon as we can.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.755
Do you know why he's in L.A.?

05:21.789 --> 05:24.925
He came for my mother's
birthday Friday night.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.259
What time did he leave?

05:26.293 --> 05:28.095
Around 10:00.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.198
(crying):
Edward-- he was a good son

05:31.231 --> 05:33.133
and a good brother.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.335
My-my kids' favorite uncle.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.471
Okay. All right.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.575
I'm sorry,
but I have to ask you.

05:41.609 --> 05:45.012
Did your brother use
prostitutes on a regular basis?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.514
Eddie was single.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.383
Because he paid for sex doesn't
make him less a human being.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.384
(cell phone ringing)

05:50.418 --> 05:51.952
Excuse me.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.323
Nikki.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.059
S.O.G. was able to vector in
on the car's GPS

05:59.092 --> 06:00.293
heading towards Alta Canyon.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.029
Colby and I are on the way.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.965
("23" by Blonde Redhead playing)

06:06.366 --> 06:07.935
(tires screeching)

06:09.903 --> 06:11.505
I got him.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.806
S.O.G., we have the target
in sight.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.408
MAN (on phone):
Roger. Verify plates.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.247
California--
David, Frank, seven...

06:20.280 --> 06:22.750
(tires screeching)

06:22.783 --> 06:24.552
Suspect is fleeing
on Alta Canyon.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.522
Where the hell does
he think he's going?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.491
Stay with him.
(siren wailing)

06:44.337 --> 06:46.206
(horn blaring)

06:46.239 --> 06:47.475
(tires screeching)

06:59.319 --> 07:00.988
Nikki!

07:03.090 --> 07:05.025
Nikki.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.062
(grunting)

07:14.535 --> 07:20.941
* 23 magic

07:20.974 --> 07:26.680
* If you change
the name of love *

07:26.714 --> 07:29.416
All right.
All right.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.651
That's it.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.490
* My crazy love...

07:51.471 --> 07:53.674
Hey, doesn't anybody
work around here?!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.408
(sighs)

07:55.442 --> 07:57.310
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Jackson to Cardiology.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.311
Dr. Jackson...

07:58.345 --> 07:59.747
(knocking on door)

07:59.780 --> 08:01.314
- It's about time.
- Uh, Nikki.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.216
(sighs)
Hi.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
Hey, Alan.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.521
Sorry. I thought
you were one of the nurses

08:07.555 --> 08:08.822
that's been M.I.A. all morning.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.190
Yeah. They're probably
afraid of you.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.792
Did you tell them
you got a gun?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.594
No, I told them no pain meds.
I'm going back to work.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.796
Well, not-not yet.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.032
Yeah, as soon as I can get
someone to come sign my papers.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.133
What's the big rush?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.234
We were within striking distance

08:21.268 --> 08:22.536
of a serial killer last night.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.503
And I want him.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.372
I'm not going to be sidelined

08:25.405 --> 08:26.506
by some bruised ribs.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.442
Ah, Nikki, you were
in a serious accident.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.545
Car wrecks,
they can mess with your mind

08:31.579 --> 08:33.714
long-term, that is,
if you don't deal with it.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.649
I know.
I totaled a car once.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.350
Hey, Colby was in it, too.
He's back at work.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.720
No, Alan.
Thank you, okay?

08:39.753 --> 08:42.556
I appreciate the concern,
I really do, but I'm okay.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.858
Yeah, well, at least, uh,
take a look at this.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.627
It's about
how people are affected

08:46.660 --> 08:49.496
by trauma
from high-speed impacts.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.333
Hey, give those flowers
to the nurse outside

08:53.366 --> 08:55.235
and have her sign me out.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.274
Which escort service
do you work for, Siouxsie?

09:01.308 --> 09:02.976
Usually Luxe.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.279
But Friday night,
I was freelancing with Eddie.

09:06.313 --> 09:10.250
He's an old client, and we just
hook up whenever he's in town.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.252
It was just for, like, an hour.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.622
And what happened after you
hooked up with Mr. Zurlanski?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.957
I waited in the bar
for him to show up,

09:16.990 --> 09:20.560
and... and then we went
to his room.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.895
And that was it.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.263
When I left,
Eddie was a happy guy.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.366
And he said that he would call
me the next time he was in town.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.602
And after that?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.272
I had another date.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.541
Through Luxe.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.178
I was at a party on the Strip
by midnight.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.481
There was cameras and a lot
of people; you can check.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.317
Did you ever have a date with

09:44.351 --> 09:46.253
any of these guys?

09:54.027 --> 09:54.928
No.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.833
Anything?

09:59.867 --> 10:03.036
Well, she doesn't seem to
recognize the previous victims.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.872
What did she say?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.140
Said she had sex with Zurlanski,
and then left.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.976
Like the prostitutes
in the other cases.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.644
It's a different girl
every time;

10:10.678 --> 10:13.313
they always have an alibi.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.482
It's not likely he would have
that many partners.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.986
So maybe he tracks his victims
through the escort service.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.021
But this girl was freelancing.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.056
Maybe he stalks them
at the hotel.

10:25.726 --> 10:29.296
David, ask her if she noticed
anybody following her.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.466
Did you see anyone watching you
at the hotel?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.268
Lots of guys watch me.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.369
You know what I'm talking about.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.673
Was anyone hanging around,
anyone following you?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.641
There was a lot of guys
at that hotel,

10:41.675 --> 10:43.610
and I made sure that
they all saw me.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.747
You are involved
in a serial murder case.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.049
We are gonna be crawling
all over your life

10:49.082 --> 10:52.920
for a very long time,
affecting your net income.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.924
Focus your mind and participate.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.994
Now, did anyone see you
enter that room

11:01.028 --> 11:02.329
with Zurlanski?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.666
A guy dropped his keys.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.636
He was in the elevator with us,

11:09.669 --> 11:11.404
and...

11:11.438 --> 11:14.742
He got off on the same floor,
and I heard them drop.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.978
I remember thinking
that that was weird because

11:18.011 --> 11:21.715
the hotel rooms use these,
like, card keys.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.150
Good. What did he look like?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.788
Uh, white, maybe.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.957
Not too tall.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.726
Darkish hair, maybe.
I don't know. Maybe he was

11:32.760 --> 11:34.627
wearing a cap.
I didn't really clock him much.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.996
Why not?

11:36.029 --> 11:39.399
Because he had on
these cheap shoes.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.770
These, like,
cheap brown loafers.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.907
And... I knew that
he could never afford me.

11:49.642 --> 11:50.744
Okay.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.646
Nondescript guy who's basically
invisible to women.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.714
Sounds like every other
serial killer

11:54.748 --> 11:57.851
in history besides Ted Bundy.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.754
But he's not attacking women,
he's attacking men.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.924
Right. And generally,
the prostitutes are the victims.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.526
Yeah. What would a profiler say
about this guy?

12:06.559 --> 12:10.030
He humiliates men that he hates
by dressing them up as women.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.500
Doesn't molest the body,
so he feels emasculated.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.636
Then he hides the crime
so that he can drive around

12:16.669 --> 12:18.738
in a fancy car
for a couple days?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.207
He essentially becomes
the guy he kills.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.675
Maybe it's abandonment
from his father,

12:22.709 --> 12:24.211
psychosexual abuse.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.947
It's just gonna come down to
how he's choosing his victims.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.082
I'll add the data from this
latest crime to my matrix,

12:29.116 --> 12:30.784
but so far, all these guys have

12:30.818 --> 12:33.753
in common is being
with prostitutes in nice hotels.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.856
Yeah, we got five dead guys,
five crime scenes,

12:35.889 --> 12:37.190
five stolen cars.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.292
We don't know a thing
about the guy.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.228
I'll let you know
what I come up with.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.263
Hey, Charlie, that, uh,
security camera footage

12:43.296 --> 12:45.833
from, uh, Friday night
that was recorded over--

12:45.866 --> 12:47.935
can you pull an image
off the hard drive?

12:47.968 --> 12:49.736
Yeah, at least partially.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.840
We've, uh, we've got a neural
network program that we used for

12:52.873 --> 12:54.441
the Nathan Watts case.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.775
Great. Thanks.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.177
How you doing there?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.279
I'm fine.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
Can't say the same
for my car, but...

13:01.314 --> 13:03.050
What about Nikki?
How's she doing?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.918
She's being hardheaded.
She's leaving the hospital.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.086
Says she's coming over here.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.088
I mean, technically,
you guys should

13:08.121 --> 13:10.423
really both take the day off.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.558
It's not gonna happen, Don.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.860
We almost had this guy
yesterday.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.228
You sure you didn't see him
at all?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.329
Nothing?

13:16.363 --> 13:17.797
No.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.967
LAPD recovered the car
off a freeway exit

13:20.000 --> 13:22.002
about an hour
after we chased him.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.170
All right, let's go back then.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.772
What about the stores
that sell the underwear?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.607
Got to be a thousand
lingerie shops in L.A.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.043
What about that guy we liked
before, the social worker?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.879
Oh, the one that had no alibi

13:31.912 --> 13:33.413
for the second
and the third murders?

13:33.446 --> 13:34.714
Jack Steves?

13:34.747 --> 13:37.684
Here he is.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.019
Says he runs
an organization called

13:39.052 --> 13:41.788
Streetwise that provides
medical aid for hookers.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.858
Well, let's see
what he was doing Friday night.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.729
I'm a suspect again?

13:49.762 --> 13:51.798
Come on.
You cleared me last time.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
No, we never cleared you,
Mr. Steves.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.435
We put you on hold.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.737
- Where were you Friday night?
- Where I am every Friday night,

13:57.770 --> 13:59.006
helping people you ignore.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.876
Wait. No, no, it's not...

14:02.910 --> 14:05.112
Right, scare off the needy.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.481
Sex workers have no rights
at all in this country.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.383
So, what, you dish out
your vigilante justice

14:10.417 --> 14:11.784
by killing the johns?

14:11.818 --> 14:12.986
You don't intimidate me, man.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.854
I fight with pimps every day.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.792
Where were you Friday night?

14:19.826 --> 14:21.861
Doing my job;
letting, uh, hookers know

14:21.895 --> 14:23.997
they have advocates
in case they get in a pinch.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.033
I worked the hotels
until about 2:00,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.700
and then I hit the streets.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.801
Okay, which hotels?

14:28.835 --> 14:30.403
We have a schedule,
and I keep notes

14:30.437 --> 14:32.906
because you like to prey on me
instead of the bad guys.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.041
So if I pull
the surveillance tapes,

14:34.074 --> 14:36.843
I'm gonna find you in the places
you were supposed to be?

14:36.876 --> 14:40.013
I mean,
I-I go where the action is.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.949
The schedule is a suggestion.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.985
See, that doesn't
sound good, Jack.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.421
Look, I get in there
with these people,

14:48.455 --> 14:50.223
wherever they are,
wherever they need me.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.125
They have no one else
looking out for them.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.860
So you're a hero to them, huh?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.328
Why is it, Jack?
Can't be the pay.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.664
Prostitutes are like rabbits
dodging hawks.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.599
I know, I used to be one.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.833
I like this job better.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.802
My schedule.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.938
(elevator bell dings)

15:09.842 --> 15:11.778
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:11.811 --> 15:13.513
This is where I work.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.915
We get the forensics
back on the body yet?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.750
Don't be so macho, okay?

15:17.784 --> 15:18.952
Go home.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.887
Colby's working.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.990
Colby didn't get knocked
unconscious.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.959
Doc cleared me to work,
so unless you're gonna fire me,

15:25.993 --> 15:27.995
I'm gonna go down
and talk to the coroner.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.929
How did you get a doctor
to sign you out?

15:29.963 --> 15:31.231
He didn't think
he could withstand

15:31.264 --> 15:33.033
seven years of IRS audits.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.402
Hey, Colby,
can you go with her?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.204
(sighs)

15:40.540 --> 15:43.543
If you ask me how I'm doing,
I'll shoot you.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.913
How you doing?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.781
Take it easy.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.383
I just got in a car accident.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.557
Code's been written over, so
I'll get partial images at best.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.060
And we're looking for the guy
who picked up his sports car

16:00.093 --> 16:01.961
- around 9:00 in the morning.
- Once the media

16:01.995 --> 16:03.096
gets rewritten, it goes out of

16:03.130 --> 16:05.632
- chronological order.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

16:05.665 --> 16:06.866
We need to avoid hopelessness.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.934
It's not useful.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.769
Are you feeling hopeless?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.171
No.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.606
Yeah. A little bit.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.310
I mean, we're missing something
in the big pattern.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.613
I sense it in the periphery,
I just can't see it.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.748
Greetings, greetings, greetings.

16:21.781 --> 16:22.782
- Hey.
- Ooh!

16:22.815 --> 16:24.551
How cool.
What are we working on?

16:24.584 --> 16:28.155
You know, I'm gonna go work
at the FBI office.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.290
(laughs):
I get it. Top secret. I get it.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
No, not really.
Just, they have

16:31.691 --> 16:33.160
more advanced equipment
over there, that's all.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.827
- Oh, okay.
- I'll see you later.

16:34.861 --> 16:35.828
See you over there.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.130
- Bye, Laz.
- Bye.

16:39.899 --> 16:40.933
She have any sisters?

16:40.967 --> 16:41.934
(chuckles)

16:41.968 --> 16:43.370
No. Sorry.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.504
Oh, okay.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.973
Hey, I need to get
your brother's phone number.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.841
Yeah, I...

16:48.875 --> 16:50.543
You want...?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.479
May I ask what for?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.480
Yeah.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.781
The motorcycle club.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.015
Your brother needs camaraderie.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.950
And he needs some instruction

16:57.984 --> 16:59.252
on caring for his crotch-rocket.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.189
(chuckles):
Uh...

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
my brother's never really been
into camaraderie.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.625
Uh...

17:05.658 --> 17:06.693
Really? Really?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.928
Or you just don't want
to give me his number.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.163
That's it? Yeah, okay.
All right, here.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.764
Listen, I'll give you my card,

17:11.798 --> 17:14.634
and you tell him that he can
call me anytime he wants.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.902
Anytime.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.071
Meaning when his bike
breaks down,

17:18.105 --> 17:19.806
which is gonna happen.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.342
Bikers are a brotherhood.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.278
He's gonna come around, okay?

17:25.312 --> 17:26.779
Okay.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.980
What's all this stuff?

17:28.014 --> 17:29.082
Geoprofiling.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.451
Oh! Is this about
your serial killer?

17:31.484 --> 17:32.419
Yeah.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.621
I, uh, input the locations
of the murders--

17:34.654 --> 17:37.056
areas where victims' cars
were abandoned,

17:37.090 --> 17:39.092
areas that the victims
frequented-- all looking

17:39.126 --> 17:42.795
for common details
to reveal a big pattern.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.698
It's like trying to locate
a shark's resting area

17:45.732 --> 17:48.034
based on its kill zone.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.703
A shark, like a serial killer,
is stealthy

17:50.737 --> 17:52.038
and prefers to ambush.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.341
He has to find a large
enough region

17:54.374 --> 17:56.343
to maintain the element
of surprise

17:56.376 --> 17:58.845
for fatal first strikes
against his prey.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.115
But he also needs to stay
within range of a refuge,

18:02.149 --> 18:04.117
should he need
to retreat to safety.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.185
Oh, I heard about those guys

18:05.218 --> 18:07.154
from U-Miami tracking
those, uh, great whites

18:07.187 --> 18:08.821
- off the coast of South Africa.
- Yes.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.723
And they use geoprofiling.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.826
So, after I input the data,
I get an output called

18:13.860 --> 18:15.128
a jeopardy surface,

18:15.162 --> 18:16.696
which is a three-dimensional
probability graphic

18:16.729 --> 18:19.332
depicting the likeliest areas
of the offender's base.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.168
God, that is awesome.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.736
That's a really
big area, though.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.038
Yeah.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.341
I can confirm
death by strangulation,

18:28.375 --> 18:31.010
but I couldn't lift fingerprints
from the marks off the neck,

18:31.043 --> 18:32.011
only latex dust.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.580
The killer wore gloves.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.047
What about the size
of the hands?

18:35.081 --> 18:36.216
Indicates a person

18:36.249 --> 18:38.785
of normal build,
maybe five-seven to five-nine.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.886
What else?

18:39.919 --> 18:42.989
I recovered DNA from
the call girl, Siouxsie Dark.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.591
Yeah, doesn't really
help us, though.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.493
We don't think the hookers
were in on it.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.428
Mr. Zurlanski had sex
before he died,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.463
and there's no indication
of genital mutilation

18:50.497 --> 18:51.931
or penetration after death.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.099
And these marks?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.835
Postmortem hits,
before the makeup was applied.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.105
So the killer beat the corpse
and then put on the makeup?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.040
Yeah, and like the other cases,

19:01.073 --> 19:04.777
there's a burn mark
on his right palm--

19:04.811 --> 19:07.013
received before death.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.315
That's not from a flame.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.517
That's from some sort
of electrical charge, right?

19:10.550 --> 19:11.551
Mm-hmm.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.720
- You find anything new?
- Yes, I did.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.288
A few epidermal cells

19:15.322 --> 19:18.791
in one of the bloodless wounds
inflicted after death.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.859
The killer's DNA?

19:19.892 --> 19:22.028
Yeah. I couldn't find
a match in the system,

19:22.061 --> 19:24.197
but at least now
we have a good sample.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.366
My guess is she skinned
her knuckles

19:26.399 --> 19:28.568
on the dead man's teeth.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.102
Her knuckles?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.904
You found female DNA
in his wounds?

19:31.938 --> 19:34.541
Definitely a woman,
definitely not the call girl.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.911
A female serial killer.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.222
Okay, female serial killer.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.090
It's a whole new slant.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.559
Did we just assume it was a man?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.126
I mean, what's our evidence?

19:54.160 --> 19:54.961
Strangle marks are inconclusive.

19:54.994 --> 19:55.962
Right.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.531
And the brown leather shoes in
the elevator could be nothing.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.534
Male serial killers do it
for a sexual thrill,

20:01.568 --> 20:04.371
but violent women tend to kill

20:04.404 --> 20:06.373
from some sense
of perverted justice.

20:06.406 --> 20:10.209
Aileen Wuornos was doing it
to avenge her abuse

20:10.243 --> 20:13.012
and to steal for a lover.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.347
So, what's up with this chick?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.616
She's mad at men who sleep
with expensive prostitutes?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.485
But the hookers
are never harmed.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.987
Ex-working girl with a grudge?

20:21.020 --> 20:23.990
But how does she overpower
these guys and strangle them?

20:24.023 --> 20:27.193
I mean, it's not like
our victims are small men.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.997
Sarah Jo Pender, Myra Hindley,

20:31.030 --> 20:33.199
Charlene Gallego, Gwen Graham...

20:33.232 --> 20:34.534
They all had partners.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.806
(typing)

20:39.839 --> 20:41.608
Think this will work?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.410
I don't know how good
it'll look, though.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.077
- Hey, so, how we doing?
- Another minute.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.913
You heard we're looking
for a woman now?

20:46.946 --> 20:49.516
Yeah, and I suggest you
engage Professor Lazlo

20:49.549 --> 20:51.250
in testing the female DNA.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.185
He's like a genetics savant.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.487
He's developed tests

20:54.521 --> 20:57.023
far more sensitive than anything
that's generally available.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.958
So he may be able
to give you guys

20:58.991 --> 21:00.092
a more accurate description.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.494
All right,
I'll take it over to him.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.195
Hey, what do you know
about that, uh,

21:03.229 --> 21:05.231
little motorcycle club
he was telling me about?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.634
Listen, he's a friendly guy,

21:07.667 --> 21:11.070
and, uh, I think he's got
a bromance thing developing

21:11.103 --> 21:12.405
- for you.
- Oh, come on.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.173
- That's so adorable.
- Yeah, all right. You just...

21:14.206 --> 21:16.175
What are we doing?
Let's go.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.276
So, as you can see,

21:17.310 --> 21:19.612
the recovered images
are highly degraded.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.281
There's lots of digital
information that's been lost.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.716
And so we're going
to apply a technique

21:23.750 --> 21:26.018
called scaled
gradient projection.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.188
It's like a partially filled in
crossword puzzle.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.057
Even if you don't
have the clues,

21:31.090 --> 21:32.392
there are some things
you can surmise

21:32.425 --> 21:34.561
knowing what you do about
spelling and phrases.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.964
Certain vowels will go together,
certain consonants will not.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.533
You can assume, for example,
that the letters Z and G

21:40.567 --> 21:43.235
will not be next to each other--
at least not in English.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.905
So, you eliminate
the unlikely possibilities

21:45.938 --> 21:47.440
and make educated conjectures

21:47.474 --> 21:49.976
as to what would appear
in the adjacent squares.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.479
And so we're going to do that
with this video.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.547
We're hypothesizing
the most probable data

21:54.581 --> 21:55.748
in the missing areas.

21:55.782 --> 21:56.983
You're guessing.

21:57.016 --> 21:57.984
Uh, yeah, more or less,

21:58.017 --> 21:59.318
but it should make the images
more legible.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.754
Okay, let's try it.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.523
I worked on
the elevator footage first.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.858
And I can do
the valet station next.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.564
Freeze that.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.199
Can you just blow it up for me?

22:13.232 --> 22:14.166
Yeah.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.135
That's not very helpful.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.336
No, you're not gonna
see much of him.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.938
He was avoiding the cameras.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.139
But show them the next bit.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.040
Okay. It's sometime later.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.576
By the way, it's impossible
to tell the time.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.579
The same guy gets off
the elevator, but with a woman.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.747
It's a team, right?

22:27.780 --> 22:28.981
Yeah, that's what
we were thinking.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.017
Maybe a pissed off ex-hooker
and some cheap brown shoe guy

22:31.050 --> 22:33.219
that she's got wrapped
around her finger.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.421
The murders started
six months ago.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.022
We should, uh, reinterview
the escort services,

22:36.055 --> 22:39.225
see if any of the girls
had a meltdown around then.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.428
Yeah, and get me
a few prints of these.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.431
So, you've already subpoenaed
all my records.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.298
I mean, what more
can I tell you?

22:46.332 --> 22:49.636
You recognize her?

22:49.669 --> 22:50.937
Oh, wow.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.905
You're in trouble
if that's the best you got.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.807
I mean, this could be me,
and I wouldn't recognize it.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.609
- So, that's a no?
- That's a no, honey.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.310
You're kind of literal,
aren't you?

22:58.344 --> 22:59.779
You have anyone quit angry

22:59.812 --> 23:01.681
within the last six months
to a year?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.716
Yeah. Maybe had a bad experience

23:03.750 --> 23:06.018
with one of the clients,
left the business?

23:06.052 --> 23:08.488
Girls go off the radar all the
time for all kinds of reasons.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.689
This would be someone

23:09.722 --> 23:11.223
with a reason to be angry
with the johns.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.359
Okay, look,
I want to help you.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.362
I mean, murdered clients
are bad for business.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.898
But I don't know what I can do.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.399
Nobody stands out.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.234
Every girl has a reason
to be angry.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.136
And most of them leave
within a year.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.640
What about medical records
for HIV or STD tests?

23:27.674 --> 23:29.809
No medical, no benefits.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.479
Yeah, we're not regulated
like the porn industry

23:32.512 --> 23:34.380
because we're not having sex.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.815
We're escorts.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.719
What about Siouxsie Dark--
the girl with the victim?

23:39.752 --> 23:42.555
She have any rough rides
in the last few months?

23:42.589 --> 23:43.923
She no longer works here.

23:43.956 --> 23:44.924
She was freelancing.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.325
She's out.

23:46.358 --> 23:49.128
Yeah, but that's not
what we asked you.

23:49.161 --> 23:53.265
Look, they all get
slapped around once in a while.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.301
It's part of the job.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.436
Excuse me.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.374
Hey!

24:02.408 --> 24:04.210
Hail, fellow! Well met!

24:04.243 --> 24:05.444
Say what?

24:05.478 --> 24:06.746
Oh, just kidding.
It's Shakespeare.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.981
- Do you have the DNA sample?
- Yeah, I got it here.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.617
But I got to walk it over
'cause it's evidence.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.284
- Oh. Roger that.
- Yeah.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.486
This way.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.387
Hey, you know
what they say about bikers.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.923
I know they call
ones without a helmet

24:16.956 --> 24:18.925
an organ donor.
Why, you got any new ones?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.694
Yeah. That 56% of bikers
have sex with a stranger

24:21.728 --> 24:23.530
within three months
of getting their wheels.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.566
- It's a fact.
- Get out of here.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.935
No, query the club members.
You should join us.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.738
It is a rockin' good time!

24:31.771 --> 24:33.540
All right, I'll think about it.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.241
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.309
COLBY:
When did you open

24:37.343 --> 24:38.545
the apartment?

24:38.578 --> 24:39.946
About an hour ago.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.380
The neighbors
started complaining

24:41.413 --> 24:43.449
about the smell yesterday.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.317
I knocked and I waited,

24:45.351 --> 24:47.353
but this is not
my first barbecue.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.454
I knew what was up.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.822
What's his name?

24:49.856 --> 24:51.257
Chas March.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.425
He's a likeable guy.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.628
Wanted to be in the movies.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.030
Meantime, he's a...

24:58.064 --> 24:59.599
he's a bartender.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.137
Guess you don't have to hide
him between the mattress

25:05.171 --> 25:07.206
if he lives alone, huh?

25:07.239 --> 25:11.477
Looks like he's got
that same burn mark on the hand.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.613
Where does he tend bar?

25:13.646 --> 25:14.614
I don't know.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.348
Uh, some fancy hotel.

25:16.382 --> 25:17.984
All right, does he own a car?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.351
In the parking spot.

25:19.385 --> 25:20.820
The rules are changing then.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.321
Unless this is a copycat.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.423
We haven't publicized
the details.

25:24.456 --> 25:26.258
- Not a copycat.
- It's only been

25:26.292 --> 25:28.160
three days since the last one.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.831
They're escalating.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.472
Chas March, 33.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.374
He's a bartender
at the Hollywoodland Hotel.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.476
It's a hot spot
for high-end hookers

25:44.510 --> 25:45.678
and on Charlie's geoprofile.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.546
We interviewed the bar patrons.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.682
Turns out, this Chas guy
was looking for a freebie

25:49.716 --> 25:50.717
from one of the girls.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.784
He called it a tax.

25:51.818 --> 25:52.852
When she wouldn't comply,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.787
he insulted her
and then kicked her out.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.756
- So they didn't close the deal?
- No.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.758
End of his shift,
he went home alone.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.227
Woke up dead,
dressed for a party.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.029
Burn mark on his right hand

26:03.062 --> 26:06.298
and body beaten after death,
just like the others.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.234
They didn't hide the body,
'cause he lives alone.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.268
So now the killer couple's

26:09.301 --> 26:11.971
going after people
who just insult prostitutes.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.806
- The trigger's more sensitive.
- Yeah, it's not even

26:13.840 --> 26:15.541
the weekend yet,
so things are moving faster.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.743
In the beginning,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.678
Aileen Wuornos-- she killed
because she felt threatened.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.146
Then she got a taste for it.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.580
You're thinking maybe

26:21.614 --> 26:23.816
they're getting into it, like
they're doing something right?

26:23.850 --> 26:26.318
Yeah, defending the honor
of the prostitutes.

26:26.352 --> 26:30.456
Sounds like that Jack Steves
guy, the, uh, social worker.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.024
Yeah, let's get
his picture around,

26:32.058 --> 26:33.459
see what shakes out.

26:33.492 --> 26:36.362
The underwear
is a discontinued style

26:36.395 --> 26:37.664
from a place
on Hollywood Boulevard.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.767
Seven months ago,
someone came in, paid cash for

26:40.800 --> 26:41.768
a dozen matching sets.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.769
There have only been

26:42.802 --> 26:44.336
six murders so far.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.738
These people aren't done yet.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.107
What happened seven months ago?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.510
Hollywoodland Hotel
was on my map.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.946
Could have saved a man's life
if I had been more precise.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.948
It indicates
you're on the right track.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.216
I guess.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.685
Okay, okay, I got something.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.887
X-linked coagulation disorder.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.254
- From the DNA?
- Yep.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.255
Great.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.791
She's got an intron 22
inversion mutation

27:04.824 --> 27:06.693
in the factor VIII gene.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.795
- She's a carrier of hemophilia.
- Okay.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.029
That's something.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.063
Damn skippy.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.899
We just reduced
the entire suspect list

27:12.932 --> 27:16.235
of all the ladies in Los Angeles
to one in 2,480.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.536
That is pretty good.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.171
All right, anything more?

27:19.205 --> 27:20.339
You know,

27:20.372 --> 27:22.241
- anything phenotypical?
- Sure.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.644
Single nucleotide polymorphisms
indicate hazel eyes,

27:25.678 --> 27:27.646
dark hair, pale complexion.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.215
- All right.
- And she's got a B-positive

27:29.248 --> 27:34.086
blood type with an admixture
of 25% Indo-Eurasian and 75%

27:34.120 --> 27:34.787
Sub-Saharan.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.922
- Great.
- And she's also, like,

27:35.955 --> 27:37.890
between five-six and five-nine.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.125
She's a tall brunette
with hazel eyes.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.292
Yeah. May I?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.560
You have access

27:41.593 --> 27:43.696
to the FBI database
on this computer, right?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.064
(laughs):
Oh, how cool is that?

27:45.097 --> 27:46.799
We've checked.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.467
The blood doesn't match
any in the system.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.501
No, I'm thinking a fuzzy search.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.037
Oh, that sounds cuddly.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.873
If the killer's
a carrier for hemophilia...

27:53.906 --> 27:55.207
you know, that runs in families.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.609
Amita's searching
for partial matches

27:57.643 --> 28:00.412
with variables of hemophilia,
blood type, eye and hair color.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.748
Oh, I see.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.516
So, maybe somebody
in her family's in the database.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.818
17 partial matches.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.887
Select for mid-city Los Angeles.

28:07.920 --> 28:08.955
Okay.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.924
Three matches.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.760
All right,
what are the charges?

28:13.793 --> 28:14.961
Juvenile male, graffiti;

28:14.994 --> 28:17.930
65-year-old male,
armed robbery; and

28:17.964 --> 28:19.598
29-year-old female,
prostitution.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.033
Door number three.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.069
Jenny Bailey.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.003
Deceased.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.438
Prostitute murdered at
the Beverly Fairfax last year.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.374
Crime unsolved.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.945
Melanie Bailey-- her sister,
Jenny, was killed last summer

28:32.979 --> 28:34.947
at the Beverly Fairfax Hotel

28:34.981 --> 28:36.182
while working as an escort.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.950
She bled to death
after a beating.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.085
She's a hemophiliac.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.052
Dead hooker.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.320
No one cared but her sister.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.422
Both girls grew up together
in foster care.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.758
They lived with each other
until Jennifer's death.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.293
- You got an address?
- Yeah, and an APB

28:47.326 --> 28:48.761
out on Melanie's car.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.467
Nikki, maybe you want
to hang back.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.769
(sighs)

28:56.803 --> 28:59.005
Let's go.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.248
(pounding on door)

29:09.281 --> 29:11.183
FBI! We got a warrant.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.301
Living room's clear.

29:30.702 --> 29:32.171
Hey, Colby.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.846
What is it with serial killers?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.680
You got half the FBI
looking for you,

29:41.713 --> 29:43.249
and you're working
on an elementary school

29:43.282 --> 29:45.217
show-and-tell project?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.187
Look at this.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.758
Edward Zurlanski.
(cell phone ringing)

29:52.791 --> 29:54.460
Chas March.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.062
They're all here.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.997
Granger.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.032
Okay. Meet you there.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.535
Bailey's car is in the parking
lot of the San Gabriel Hotel.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.309
You check the bar.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.244
I got the manager.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.630
Yeah, um, I'll get a water.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.532
Oh, big night, huh?

30:33.565 --> 30:35.501
- Yeah. Just get the water.
- Bottled or tap?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.536
Flat or fizzy?

30:37.569 --> 30:38.737
I'll have tap.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.472
You got it.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.389
I'm waiting for someone.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.460
You're under arrest.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.132
Oh.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.000
I see.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.136
You want to come with me?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.172
Sure.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.376
(handcuffs clicking)

31:23.182 --> 31:25.484
Where's your partner?

31:25.517 --> 31:27.086
I don't know what you mean.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.787
We know there's a guy
who's working with you.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.189
- Where is he?
- Working with me where?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.124
You know what,
take her to the office.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.026
Hey, you guys,
let's lock this place down.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.694
All right, I'll check
with the manager

31:35.727 --> 31:37.296
for rooms rented to solo guys.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.265
All right.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.233
How exciting.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.035
FBI.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.171
- Open the door, sir.
- FBI. Open up, please.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.238
FBI.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.643
We know about your sister--
Jenny Bailey.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.979
Really?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.047
You solve her murder yet?

31:55.081 --> 31:57.416
I can understand
how that would bother you.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.558
MELANIE:
There's only one reason

32:06.592 --> 32:07.960
you're talking about Jenny.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.495
Well, you've been
avenging her death.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.797
Now you have our attention.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.466
So, let's work this out.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.567
FBI. Open the door.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.702
Open up.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.537
It's the FBI.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.605
FBI.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.672
DAVID:
Where is he?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.108
Who?

32:22.141 --> 32:25.511
We have the both of you
on surveillance tape, Melanie.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.280
Come on. Mel.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.818
Is he your boss, Mel?

32:32.851 --> 32:35.387
Does he tell you what to do?

32:37.856 --> 32:40.626
Oh, maybe he's your lover.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.796
(knocking,
indistinct radio chatter)

32:44.830 --> 32:46.198
Fourth floor's clear.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.966
Nothing. We checked
all the rooms.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.401
So, where the hell is he?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.370
Maybe they haven't
gotten started yet.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.040
Or he's doing his dirty work
off-site, like the last guy.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.974
You know what, check all
the surveillance cameras.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.509
We have DNA evidence.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.211
It's over.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.680
Mmm, no.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.150
It's not over.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.085
It's happening right now.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.328
There's Bailey.
Who did she talk to?

33:16.362 --> 33:19.598
She sat there alone all night
slow drinking rum and cokes.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.599
Wait, wait, back that up.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.902
Yeah, right there.

33:23.935 --> 33:27.473
That is Jack Steves,
the social worker.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.474
Yeah, he comes in

33:28.507 --> 33:30.709
every once in a while
to hassle the pros.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.843
Did he follow anyone out?

33:31.877 --> 33:33.079
Not that I noticed.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.714
Was he talking to Bailey?

33:35.747 --> 33:36.715
I don't think so.

33:36.748 --> 33:37.649
(camera shutter clicks)

33:42.788 --> 33:45.291
It's unraveling, Mel.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.093
It unraveled seven months ago.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.661
I'm playing the hand
I was dealt.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.963
So, where's Jack Steves now?

33:51.997 --> 33:53.399
Oh, is that his name?

33:53.432 --> 33:55.000
Where is he?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.469
Getting what he deserves.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.238
BARTENDER:
Yeah, Jack's kind of a downer.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.374
He chats up the working girls
about medical care

34:02.408 --> 34:03.742
and HIV testing.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.812
But tonight he was trying
to get them to go home.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.747
Oh, crap.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.383
Kept warning them about murders.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.421
Steves isn't her partner,
he's a target.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.023
A guy followed him out
of the bar, checked with her

34:18.056 --> 34:19.658
- before he left.
- Where does he live?

34:19.691 --> 34:21.560
- West L.A.
- All right, guys, get on that.

34:21.593 --> 34:25.531
How come you race
like crazy to save perverts,

34:25.564 --> 34:27.933
but no one came
to the aide of my sister?

34:27.966 --> 34:29.368
Why is that?

34:33.605 --> 34:36.208
DAVID:
We have a chance to catch LAPD

34:36.242 --> 34:38.710
if we go lights and siren
and at full speed.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.746
All right, why don't you drive.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.648
Should only be allowed
to total one car per case.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.451
All right, let's see
what kind of damage I can do.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.720
(siren wailing)

34:59.064 --> 35:01.066
NIKKI:
You're done.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.801
Because somebody looked at me
in a bar?

35:02.834 --> 35:03.969
He make you do it, Mel?

35:04.002 --> 35:05.103
Is he the mastermind?

35:05.137 --> 35:07.673
You're just doing
what he tells you?

35:07.706 --> 35:09.975
DON:
Look, here's the way it works.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.211
You talk now, you get a deal.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.748
(knocking)
STEVES: Yeah, who is it?

35:18.317 --> 35:20.386
(electricity crackles)

35:21.587 --> 35:24.723
You know California is
a death penalty state, right?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.865
His name is Rusty Dieben.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.801
Jenny and I met him
in foster care.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.836
He's a psycho from way back.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.773
So, why is he avenging
your sister's death?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.475
Rusty just likes to hurt people.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.312
(grunting)

35:46.345 --> 35:49.248
- You used him?
- Yeah.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.454
If Rusty's the boss,
that makes you

35:55.487 --> 35:57.856
the girlfriend
of a two-bit thrill killer.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.191
But if you're the leader...

35:59.225 --> 36:01.393
You go down in history
as one of the most successful

36:01.427 --> 36:02.861
female serial killers ever.

36:02.894 --> 36:05.864
And you did it all
for your sister.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.367
Jenny's never forgotten.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.470
(yelling and grunting)

36:13.672 --> 36:16.875
Steves was scaring the girls,
telling them we were dangerous.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.210
We're protecting them.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.611
How's that?

36:19.645 --> 36:21.046
You think a john's
gonna hurt a hooker

36:21.079 --> 36:22.180
if he knows we're watching?

36:22.214 --> 36:24.916
Anybody disrespects
a working girl,

36:24.950 --> 36:28.354
we tase them, strangle them,
beat the crap out of them,

36:28.387 --> 36:31.790
then we dress those macho
bastards up in the cartoon trash

36:31.823 --> 36:33.259
they want the girls to wear.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.526
This was your idea?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.731
(grunting)

36:53.078 --> 36:54.480
- FBI!
- FBI!

36:54.513 --> 36:55.914
- Get off him!
- Get up!

36:55.947 --> 36:56.915
Back up!

36:58.049 --> 36:59.017
(grunting)

36:59.050 --> 37:00.686
Up!

37:04.022 --> 37:04.990
Easy!

37:05.023 --> 37:06.692
What is your problem?!

37:06.725 --> 37:08.026
What did I do to you?!

37:08.059 --> 37:09.995
We're the guardians, not you!

37:10.028 --> 37:10.862
(grunts)

37:10.896 --> 37:13.131
Take it easy.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.233
All right, get a statement.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.773
We were both treated
like garbage our whole lives.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.510
Somehow Jenny never got bitter.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.880
Jenny bled to death because

37:28.914 --> 37:33.084
the deviant who beat her up
also stole her purse

37:33.118 --> 37:35.287
with her hemophilia meds in it.

37:38.056 --> 37:40.792
And nobody cared.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.028
Nobody.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.831
Cops wouldn't even talk to me.

37:45.864 --> 37:49.735
My little sister
was just another dead hooker.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.307
Well, not anymore.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.448
DAVID:
So, what's up with you?

38:02.481 --> 38:05.684
You're not gonna drive anymore?

38:05.717 --> 38:07.285
Of course I am.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.254
Just need a little time to pass.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.557
Okay.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.525
You know, when I was
walking out to the car,

38:13.559 --> 38:14.926
I had a flash of the accident,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.462
and I just don't want that

38:16.495 --> 38:18.764
getting in the way
of my instincts.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.566
Want to get a beer?

38:20.599 --> 38:22.233
Uh, not tonight, boys, thanks.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.301
Hey, good job though, huh?

38:23.335 --> 38:26.104
Good night.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.573
What are you still doing here?

38:27.606 --> 38:30.275
I'm just curious
about something.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.276
Yeah, what's that?

38:31.309 --> 38:34.613
Who killed Jenny Bailey.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.717
Let me know
if you find anything, huh?

38:40.952 --> 38:43.589
("Tomorrow Still Comes"
by Will Dailey playing)

38:43.622 --> 38:48.293
Yep, I told you
it was the hemophilia.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.028
Yes, Laz, you were
very helpful on the case.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.029
Oh, well, anytime.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.232
I enjoy practical applications.

38:54.265 --> 38:55.567
I know what you mean.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.669
Listen, I'm, uh,
I'm just heading out.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.305
Hey, uh,
about the, uh, motorcycle

39:00.338 --> 39:01.740
riding club and your brother...

39:01.773 --> 39:04.109
Hmm, yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Laz.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.110
(groans)

39:05.143 --> 39:06.978
It would totally
up our street cred.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.415
We have got scientists,
dentists, pharmacists,

39:09.448 --> 39:11.282
two accountants,
one guy from the humanities,

39:11.316 --> 39:14.953
but we don't have anybody that,
you know, has taken a bullet.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.055
You know, he was also stabbed.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.391
Zounds, that is impressive!

39:19.425 --> 39:21.359
You don't think
there's any way that

39:21.393 --> 39:23.294
he would, you know, join us?

39:23.328 --> 39:26.031
Uh, Don's not really a joiner.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.733
But, uh,

39:27.766 --> 39:29.468
I suppose anything's possible.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.037
(motorcycle engine revving)

39:32.070 --> 39:34.840
* I'll take the high road *

39:34.873 --> 39:38.410
* The one you pave
with patience and love *

39:38.444 --> 39:42.714
* Let my pages
turn with the tide *

39:42.748 --> 39:44.816
* I have made you my crutch

39:44.850 --> 39:48.920
* Yeah, I owe you too much,
I can only clean up *

39:48.954 --> 39:53.725
* And get out the gallows
from my mind *

39:53.759 --> 39:57.629
* And if I kick tomorrow,
would you stick with me? *

39:57.663 --> 40:00.832
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:00.866 --> 40:04.870
* I know I'm not as straight
as I would like to be *

40:04.903 --> 40:08.106
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:08.139 --> 40:12.844
* And though it's hard enough *

40:12.878 --> 40:15.146
* As it is

40:15.180 --> 40:18.617
* Tomorrow still comes

40:18.650 --> 40:22.087
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:22.120 --> 40:25.657
* Tomorrow still comes

40:25.691 --> 40:29.060
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:29.094 --> 40:32.798
* Tomorrow still comes

40:32.831 --> 40:37.469
* Tomorrow still comes. *

41:01.793 --> 41:02.160
(gunshot)
