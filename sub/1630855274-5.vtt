01:44.395 --> 01:45.230
Yes?

01:46.397 --> 01:48.066
Is the plan proceeding?

01:48.066 --> 01:50.443
Yes. Yes, sir. The plan is proceeding.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.591
There were similar explosions
at the other refugee centers too.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.553
Broadcasting the final round
was bait.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.890
I think you should see him.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.434
Yeah.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.648
Tell me who's behind all this,
you bastard.

02:39.784 --> 02:40.785
Tell me, now.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.830
What are you guys planning next?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.551
You bastard, just tell me
how many others are out there.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.848
Nobody knows for sure.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.850
You're psychotic.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.566
It'd be easier to die, right?

03:19.991 --> 03:21.242
I'll do it for you.

DELIVERYMAN RECRUITMENT TOURNAMENT WINNER

04:18.925 --> 04:19.801
How are you feeling?

04:20.635 --> 04:23.179
You must have known all this,
that I'm a mutant?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.143
We need to leave.

04:31.854 --> 04:32.855
You can ask 5-8.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.149
I'm out of it.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.260
<i>5-7,
status registration complete.</i>

05:03.928 --> 05:05.054
That's all I get?

05:06.889 --> 05:09.267
They were trying
to wipe out the refugees.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.812
Everything's clear now.
The refugees aren't part of their plan.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.776
Shouldn't we tell them
and join forces with the refugees?

05:18.776 --> 05:20.528
We can't let it happen again.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.864
It's already happening again.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.117
If we organize, it'll give them an excuse.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.414
We'll move first this time around.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.879
Infiltrate the Core District?

05:39.380 --> 05:40.214
No.

05:43.718 --> 05:44.927
Ryu Seok gets captured.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.517
I've never seen
such a healthy mutant before.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.145
Should we observe the boy
in one of our labs, sir?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.397
Not right now.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.525
We've got too many eyes and ears on us.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.862
We'll take it slow.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.740
I want his test results before we move.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.495
We could recover
from the human experimentation failures.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.082
You're more thrilled than me right now.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.418
All I ever do is worry about you, sir.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.379
Anyway, the refugee removal plan

06:19.379 --> 06:22.840
and the Deliveryman Selection Competition
were a resounding success.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.342
Congratulations, sir.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.057
How bad was it?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.434
What?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.521
I don't know.

06:37.647 --> 06:41.109
They just turned to ashes before my eyes.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.119
It's okay to mourn a while.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.203
You mourn your loss,

06:52.954 --> 06:54.580
then go around to each district

06:54.580 --> 06:57.375
and tell everybody
they need to be careful for a while.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.836
Do you understand?

06:59.836 --> 07:00.837
Yeah.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.463
All right.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.799
<i>Sa-wol won,</i>

07:05.675 --> 07:07.427
but then it was horrible.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.722
If not for Grandpa...

07:14.016 --> 07:15.643
we could've been killed as well.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.395
You're right.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.941
But what's with that wound
on Sa-wol's forehead?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.027
Pretty sure it was shining, right?

07:25.027 --> 07:28.156
Is Sa-wol some kind of mutant, or what?

07:30.575 --> 07:31.451
I don't know.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.078
But maybe we should ask.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.838
I guess you knew I'd come.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.381
But you're late.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.560
It looks like a surgical scar.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.561
What is it?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.230
It's the amygdala.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.984
It was basically a surgery on his brain.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.321
They don't have any emotions.
They kill people, kill themselves.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.450
We just captured one earlier.
The animal blew himself up.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.911
What happened today earlier today
was a massacre.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.621
Yeah, that's why I came.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.788
I need to be certain.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.296
Maybe this might help you
to be more certain.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.720
They were burned beyond use.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.556
A lot of the files have been encrypted.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.391
You can decrypt them, can't you?

08:38.142 --> 08:40.811
- What I want to know is--
- What their planning next is our focus.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.315
And the GPS data.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.240
You gonna find
these guys' leader?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.617
I always give back as good as I get it.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.701
Let me ask you.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.329
You and the ten
former-refugee deliverymen,

08:58.329 --> 09:00.122
what do you want to accomplish?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.375
Cheonmyeong to be destroyed.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.255
Well, I don't know
if I can do that much for you.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.092
Then how much can you help us get done?

09:18.599 --> 09:21.102
<i>I can't move forward

09:21.102 --> 09:23.813

11:43.953 --> 11:45.830
I know Seul-ah would love this.

11:47.081 --> 11:47.915
Mm-hmm.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.589
No questions for me?

11:57.466 --> 11:58.300
Like?

11:59.051 --> 12:00.636
You know I'm a mutant, don't you?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.475
Don't tell me
that you have superpowers now?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.104
No powers just yet.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.361
Okay, about your mutant status here,

12:17.361 --> 12:19.905
you're gonna get a lot of attention
now that people know.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.199
Always be careful.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.246
Mm-hmm.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.728
- What is it?
- The chairman's asked for you.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.108
Are things progressing well?

12:56.108 --> 12:59.570
Yes. We took Yoon Sa-wol's blood
and extracted mutant stem cells,

12:59.570 --> 13:01.405
and are preparing
to run a test on a candidate

13:01.405 --> 13:03.407

13:49.703 --> 13:50.955
She does.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.998
She now knows who we all are.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.084
Can we trust her?

13:57.753 --> 14:00.548
We are on different paths,
yet we have the same goal.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.428
I hope there's enough evidence
to arrest Ryu Seok.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.057
It's the Major who needs the evidence.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.475
Hmm?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.104
What are you planning?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.857
What's going on?

14:28.617 --> 14:29.869
Where on earth is he?

14:33.789 --> 14:34.832
Oh hey, man!

14:42.256 --> 14:44.842
- Don't we have a lot to talk about?
- We do.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.343
We'll talk after work.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.012

15:52.576 --> 15:55.120
right before the relocation plan
went into action.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.166
So assure me it's absurd
to think you were involved with it.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.923
You did tell me you couldn't trust anyone,

16:06.632 --> 16:08.842
so don't pretend that you'd believe me.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.597
I'll speak to the president and move up
the relocation plan announcement.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.934
With those mysterious terrorists
running about,

16:17.518 --> 16:21.480
we need a safe place we can send
the refugees to live as soon as possible.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.398
Well, sir--

16:22.398 --> 16:26.110
Go over the government's relocation plan
and fix whatever's not working,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.154
and then a meeting should be set up
right away.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.795
I have already finished revising
any shortcomings in the government's plan.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.048
If I fail to convince you,
there's nothing else I could do.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.927
I'll conduct a census
and speak to the president about it.

16:51.927 --> 16:56.390
I cannot for the life of me tell
what's going on in your head.

now I'm a deliveryman!

17:55.282 --> 17:57.493

23:36.373 --> 23:39.459
I got the report that you decided
to accommodate the refugees

23:39.459 --> 23:40.460
in General Districts.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.630
I've made some revisions
based on the government plan.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.257
The president and the chairman agreed.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.008
You'll be taking a census.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.136
Let me know if I can help you with that.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.429
Of course.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.724
In addition, I'll be providing
the refugees physical examinations.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.227
We don't know
what diseases or viruses they have,

23:57.227 --> 24:00.147
so we must consider using
a comprehensive vaccination.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.608
It's true
that fewer people starve to death

24:04.192 --> 24:06.153
than die because of a common cold.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.240
I'm sure that vaccines will be crucial
for the success of the plan.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.536
Why don't you confer with Mr. Oh,
a director, about the details?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.204
Yes, I'll schedule a meeting.

24:17.956 --> 24:18.790
<i>Yoon Sa-wol.</i>

24:22.377 --> 24:23.753
5-7.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.255
Mm-hmm.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.299
I've told you everything now.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.677
Got any questions?

24:31.845 --> 24:32.762
No, I'm all right.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.815
You decide if you're going with us.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.298
Oh my God.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.176
Gramps, got a package.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.802
Is that right?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.598
TOURNAMENT WINNER

25:17.349 --> 25:18.725
Oh my goodness.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.894
What the heck is this, huh?

25:21.561 --> 25:23.230
But why did you bring it here?

25:24.314 --> 25:26.608
You fought hard for this.
You won, it's yours.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.485
You should have it.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.738
You should cherish it, you rascal.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.993
- Grandpa.
- What?

25:36.993 --> 25:38.745
Sure, my wish came true,

25:39.371 --> 25:41.248
but there's still a lot I don't know.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.210
Course there is, you've got much to learn.
You have no idea.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.505
This is just the beginning.
There's a lot more to learn.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.091
You become a grown-up little by little.

25:51.591 --> 25:52.968
You understand?

25:57.013 --> 25:58.515
That's it for today's lesson.

26:01.017 --> 26:02.561
Don't die till I come back.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.469
There's hard evidence
about the kidnappings and the explosions

26:36.469 --> 26:38.054
during the final round,

26:38.054 --> 26:41.016
but no traces or Cheonmyeong
or Ryu Seok's involvement.

26:41.516 --> 26:45.228
The encrypted files didn't have anything
on their next plan of action either.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.605
What about the GPS data?

26:46.605 --> 26:50.275
They move about here and there,
but no repeated coordinates.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.235
I think they're a point organization,

26:52.235 --> 26:54.571
they rally when given an order
and then scatter again.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.823
Nothing very helpful.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.451
If the DIC takes action
based on so little,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.661
we'll just get the grunts
and their leaders will escape.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.416
Are you sure about Ryu Seok?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.253
Didn't we reach the same conclusion?

27:10.253 --> 27:13.173
The government's plan
has been chosen for the relocation.

27:13.673 --> 27:15.925
They'll start physical examinations

27:15.925 --> 27:18.345
and do a census
to assign refugees to General Districts.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.805
Ryu Seok yielded.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.767
You really think
he'd give up so easily?

27:25.894 --> 27:27.437
He would never do that.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.693
<i>The relocation plan
led by the government</i>

27:33.693 --> 27:35.945
<i>will include you, the refugees.</i>

27:35.945 --> 27:37.822
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

27:37.822 --> 27:40.575
<i>that will allow you
to live in General Districts.</i>

27:40.575 --> 27:43.203
<i>All refugees must register
their personal information,</i>

27:43.203 --> 27:45.330
<i>complete a physical examination,</i>

27:45.330 --> 27:48.458
<i>and get vaccinated
to be reassigned to General Districts.</i>

27:51.503 --> 27:55.757
<i>The relocation plan led by the government
will include you, the refugees.</i>

27:56.257 --> 27:57.676
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

27:57.676 --> 27:59.969
<i>that will allow you
to live in General Districts.</i>

28:00.595 --> 28:03.181
<i>All refugees must register
their personal information,</i>

28:03.181 --> 28:05.183
<i>complete a physical examination,</i>

28:05.183 --> 28:08.395
<i>and get vaccinated
to be reassigned to General Districts.</i>

28:38.174 --> 28:39.259
Can you move?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.612
Move him this way, hurry!

29:07.912 --> 29:09.706
We can't let them escape! Get them!

30:03.009 --> 30:04.219
EMERGENCY, MEETING REQUESTED

30:23.321 --> 30:24.489
What happened to you?

30:25.406 --> 30:26.825
What's with the face?

30:29.285 --> 30:30.578
It's those damn deliverymen.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.663
Tell me everything.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.166
I was ambushed
and captured by, uh... by 5-8.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.876
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.253
Him and the other deliverymen.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.088
So how the hell did you get out of there?

30:40.713 --> 30:42.048
The rescue team arrived.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.424
Team? No team was sent.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.393
Why'd you get me involved in this,
you fucking idiot.

31:01.150 --> 31:02.151
What do you want?

31:07.782 --> 31:08.616
You good?

31:17.041 --> 31:19.043
- This gonna work?
- Of course, it will.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.641
Watch where you're pointing that thing.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.351
You're way out of bounds here.

31:35.935 --> 31:36.895
I'm sure you're right.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.606
What the hell are you planning to do, huh?

31:41.232 --> 31:44.277
How funny.
That's what I was gonna ask you.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.696
Drop the gun and take a seat.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.665
You two working together?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.709
You really think
you'll get away with this?

31:59.709 --> 32:02.921
Murdering deliverymen,
bombings, kidnapping children,

32:02.921 --> 32:04.088
genocide.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.507
You're under arrest,
we have witnesses for everything.

32:09.719 --> 32:10.845
What now?

32:13.389 --> 32:15.183
This becomes public, and, well,

32:16.726 --> 32:18.061
the bomb in your neck goes off.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.022
ACTIVATE

32:21.022 --> 32:22.857
I'm sorry.

32:23.524 --> 32:24.651
Sir, I'm sorry!

32:25.234 --> 32:27.070
I'll never again make that mistake.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.199
STOP

32:32.575 --> 32:33.785
Mr. Oh.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.455
Think about how you feel right now
and always remember it.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.418
What do you want, huh?

32:43.002 --> 32:44.379
You planning more killings?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.713
There's no need for that.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.299
They're going with the government's plan.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.009
What about the kids you kidnapped?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.052
Where are they?

32:51.761 --> 32:54.389
I have no idea, but...

32:54.389 --> 32:56.349
...I doubt they're still alive.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.017
Let's stop wasting time.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.047
It's painful
when you can't breathe, right?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.298
No, don't...

33:48.985 --> 33:50.319
Give us what we want.

33:51.654 --> 33:54.574
Solid information we can use
to track the whereabouts of Ryu Seok.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.535
You want me to give you all that?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.955
Want all the blame falling on you,
or someone else?

34:04.208 --> 34:07.253
<i>We ask that all refugees
at the physical examination center</i>

34:07.253 --> 34:08.796
<i>for the relocation plan</i>

34:08.796 --> 34:11.799
<i>stand in line to register
your personal information first.</i>

34:13.634 --> 34:15.845
- So am I done?
- Yes.

34:16.429 --> 34:19.849
You can move into the General Districts,
barring any health problems.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.059
Okay, thank you.

34:21.059 --> 34:25.063
Oh, and word to the others
that they have to get vaccinated soon too.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.397
I will.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.575
Well, these guys are springing up.

34:37.575 --> 34:41.162
Yeah, although they do droop now and then.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.581
The soil's from down south.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.626
- From down south?
- Yes.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.586
How's the General District's air?

34:50.671 --> 34:52.632
Can't be out for ten minutes
without a mask.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.553
So even if the refugees go
to the General District

34:57.553 --> 34:59.138
there won't be fresh air available.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.365
All right, let's start.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.226
Mr. Oh.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.479
His face is getting rosier, right?

35:49.856 --> 35:52.692
Yes, his color is returning for sure.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.091
Where would I be now?

37:00.426 --> 37:03.387
5-7: DOING DELIVERIES
5-8: FIRST MISSION

37:12.480 --> 37:14.774
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

37:14.774 --> 37:17.276

37:22.031 --> 37:23.908

37:23.908 --> 37:25.952
<i>Pollution level five, dangerous.</i>

37:26.702 --> 37:28.579
<i>Air purification in progress.</i>

37:50.977 --> 37:52.645
AIR POLLUTION LEVEL

37:56.357 --> 37:58.234
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE EMITTED

38:17.670 --> 38:20.965
Those maniacs.
I didn't think they'd go this far.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.718
Cheonmyeong's power started from oxygen.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.888
If the air gets cleaner,
they will lose everything.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.687
<i>Noona.</i>

38:38.774 --> 38:40.693
You sure they're polluting the air
on purpose?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.361
I measured it myself.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.869
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

38:49.869 --> 38:51.203
What'll you do now?

39:00.546 --> 39:02.256
Gonna be rough from here on out,

39:02.923 --> 39:04.925
so you do what you feel is right.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.766
Are the physical examinations
going well?

39:11.766 --> 39:13.559
Yes, the explosions scared them,

39:13.559 --> 39:16.062
but more of them
are getting exams without problems,

39:16.062 --> 39:18.606
which makes it a bit more popular
as we proceed.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.864
<i>Refugees who have finished
registering their personal information</i>

39:26.864 --> 39:30.284
<i>will receive a basic physical examination,
including measuring height and weight,</i>

39:30.284 --> 39:32.453
<i>and receive a comprehensive vaccine shot.</i>

39:32.953 --> 39:36.082
<i>The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:39.710
<i>in consideration of the weakened
immune system and health of refugees.</i>

39:39.710 --> 39:42.838
<i>The vaccine has undergone a thorough range
of clinical trials and tests</i>

39:42.838 --> 39:44.965
<i>to prove its safety and efficacy.</i>

39:47.176 --> 39:48.010
<i>Refugees will...</i>

39:48.010 --> 39:50.012
Oh, there's more than I thought.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.807
I'm sure it's because we had announced
that you'd be here.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.729
<i>Once all refugees
have completed their examinations,</i>

39:58.729 --> 40:02.316
<i>the government and Cheonmyeong Group
