10:46.280 --> 10:47.081

10:47.114 --> 10:48.916
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait my phone.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.117

10:50.151 --> 10:51.719
- Tommy, you guys
come to my place.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.155
- Here, here.

10:54.889 --> 10:56.023
- Don't you touch me!

10:56.057 --> 10:57.191
- What did I tell you?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.693
- What did I tell you?

10:59.727 --> 11:01.695
- Damn, fuck you!

11:01.729 --> 11:04.131
- Fuck you, fuck you!

Shit, hey, hey, we
gotta go, we gotta go.

11:17.378 --> 11:21.315
- All right guys,
the sirens are gone.

11:22.283 --> 11:25.052
- That Dave was
lying anyway, man.

11:25.086 --> 11:26.087
- Man I hate that
fucking hippy limpy

11:26.120 --> 11:28.189

"Get out of here!"

11:29.090 --> 11:30.891
I bet I knock him out.

11:30.925 --> 11:32.326
- All right, he's
like a man though.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.862
- So, man, I've never
lost a fight, bro.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.063
I'm 10 toes down in this bitch.

11:36.097 --> 11:38.132
- Yeah 10 toes.

11:38.165 --> 11:42.870
- Guys, guys, I'm feeling

11:42.903 --> 11:44.338
- It's Vicodin, dumb ass.

11:45.239 --> 11:48.809
Fucking stupid.
- Man, I think I feel it too.

11:48.843 --> 11:50.144

11:50.177 --> 11:51.045
- Man, let's get some beer.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.079
- From your spot?

11:52.113 --> 11:54.682
- No, my dad just got
back from.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.051
He's like trying to
be sober and stuff.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.853
- Yeah like kinda sober.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.087
- Yeah, whatever.

12:00.121 --> 12:02.022
- Hey, my
body feels numb, man.

12:02.056 --> 12:02.690
- Oh, shit, mine too.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.924
- Yes sir.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.227
- Steve, you can't just say
anything that Tommy says, bro.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.094
Wanna be.

12:07.128 --> 12:08.162

12:17.171 --> 12:18.172
- Man, what the fuck?

12:18.205 --> 12:19.974

12:20.007 --> 12:21.375
Okay, we're getting beer, damn.

12:21.409 --> 12:23.711
- Man whatever, I

12:23.744 --> 12:24.812
- No, you can't.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.113

- You know what
I was thinking?

12:44.765 --> 12:45.666
- What?

12:45.699 --> 12:47.268
What would happen if
we took three Vikes?

12:47.301 --> 12:49.437
- Shit, we'd be
higher that a mountain.

12:49.471 --> 12:50.438
- It's crazy man.

12:50.472 --> 12:51.272

13:10.257 --> 13:11.926
- All right.

13:17.131 --> 13:18.098
- What the hell are you doing?

13:18.132 --> 13:18.866
- I didn't take it.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.100

13:20.134 --> 13:22.203

- Uh-huh.

13:30.010 --> 13:30.744
- Hey, you're not my mom.

13:30.778 --> 13:32.079
- Goddamn right,

13:32.112 --> 13:33.113
You listen to me.
- Let go of me!

13:33.147 --> 13:34.081
- Listen, listen.
- I'm listening.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.951
- I said, I'm listening.

13:39.353 --> 13:41.922
- Give me the card,
I want my card back.

13:41.956 --> 13:43.224
- What card?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.359
- You think I'm
stupid, don't you?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.228
- Tommy.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.831
- Isaiah, stay there.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.270
- You think you're tough?

13:57.338 --> 13:59.474
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

13:59.507 --> 14:01.976
I could have your dad
kick you outta here.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.313
Then what are you gonna do?

14:06.347 --> 14:08.349
You wouldn't last one night.

14:10.351 --> 14:12.253
I've been out there, there's
fucking monsters out there.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.188
- No, I can take
care of myself.

14:14.221 --> 14:17.091
- A real man takes
responsibility,

14:17.124 --> 14:18.959
and all you do is lie.

14:18.993 --> 14:21.996
And that's gonna bite you
in the mother fucking ass.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.364
You are not a man.

14:23.397 --> 14:24.331
- Now, what about you, huh?

14:24.365 --> 14:25.899
What do you do?

14:25.933 --> 14:27.835
You just like drink your
shit and sit around,

14:27.868 --> 14:28.802
you don't do anything.

14:28.836 --> 14:31.406
- Give me my card or
I will belt you again.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.845
- That sounds dope.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.990
- Three of a kind
don't beat no full house.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.292
- The fuck it doesn't,
Russ that's three fucking kings.

15:25.326 --> 15:26.428
- You could have
three fucking aces,

15:26.461 --> 15:28.228
it don't beat a full house.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.097
- That bullshit, that's a king.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.999
- It's not bullshit, come on.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.968
Wait, wait, so listen,
hand me that card.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.906
This piece of shit
fires up the Camaro,

15:38.939 --> 15:41.975
he don't even look to see
there's two flat tires.

15:42.009 --> 15:42.876
- Two tires?

15:42.910 --> 15:45.447
- Fuck yes, man, let
me tell the story.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.148
Yes, both tires on the
passenger side are flat

15:48.182 --> 15:51.118
because someone stole my
knock off like a week before,

15:51.151 --> 15:54.388
and cut the tires out.
- Vicodin, yeah.

15:54.422 --> 15:56.156
- 'Cause he was
prick, that's why.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.526
Nigga fuck that.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.628
- Man, I hear it fire up.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.364
The damn thing sounds
like a 12 gauge

16:03.397 --> 16:05.667
when the engine's
cold, you know?

16:05.700 --> 16:10.270
And it's February, so I
run out there in my boxers,

16:10.304 --> 16:11.439
dick flopping.

16:13.641 --> 16:16.544
Asshole started driving,
tires wobbling and shit.

16:17.344 --> 16:21.449
I chase him on foot,
down to the 7-Eleven.

16:21.483 --> 16:23.150
I was barefoot, man.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.084
- I was barefoot too.

16:24.118 --> 16:25.620
- We were barefoot.

16:25.653 --> 16:29.156
Fucking cock sucker drove a
quarter of a mile on my rims.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.257
- He got out and
ran at 7-Eleven.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.493
- He got away?
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.526 --> 16:32.627
- You should have shot him, man.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.262
I would've fucking shot him.
- Yeah.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.997
- He cut through the
power line field,

16:37.030 --> 16:39.166
I wasn't about to
chase him in there.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.267
People get electrocuted.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.136
- Bullshit.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.203
- Well bullshit, they do.

16:43.237 --> 16:45.339
I mean, you run through
the field next time then.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.442
- Maybe I will.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:47.475 --> 16:49.042
- I saw a guy, Jared, he
gotta let electrocuted,

16:49.076 --> 16:49.977
I still see him run.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.011
He's all walking funny and shit.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.347
Guy can't fuck right.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.682
I got it. All right, all right.

16:54.716 --> 16:59.052
Deal the cards and
learn how to play.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.589
- King's rule bitch.
- Learn how to play.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.093
- What's up?

17:08.262 --> 17:10.164
- What, nothing, nothing dad.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.433
- You ain't doing nothing?

17:16.170 --> 17:17.137
- Can I have one?

17:17.171 --> 17:18.238
- You got five.

17:21.743 --> 17:25.613
Tell you what, you get
three balls in a bag,

17:26.448 --> 17:29.717
everyone you miss, I
take a couple beers away.

17:30.685 --> 17:32.152
- Where's the balls at?

17:32.186 --> 17:34.221
- You already got three
in your hand, dummy.

17:37.425 --> 17:40.294
- You're gonna cheat
dad, come on now.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.465
- Boy, I

17:45.199 --> 17:46.066
- All right.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.205

17:59.213 --> 18:00.582
- Damn right I'm winning.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.251
- You gonna give
Jenny back her card?

18:06.186 --> 18:06.921
- Okay.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.189
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Okay.

18:09.223 --> 18:11.726
Now come on, throw it higher.

18:12.627 --> 18:13.461

18:20.435 --> 18:21.769
- Come on, dad.

18:23.571 --> 18:24.606
- The shit went in.

18:24.639 --> 18:26.474
- Whoa, watch your mouth.

18:26.508 --> 18:29.209
You gotta aim, man, okay.

18:29.243 --> 18:31.078
Throw it like you mean it.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.213
- Okay, all right,

18:33.247 --> 18:34.415
- You bad, you bad, you ready.

18:34.449 --> 18:37.050
- Yeah, I'm bad, watch this.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.387

18:46.226 --> 18:48.563
Come on dad, who the man?

18:50.130 --> 18:52.767

18:52.800 --> 18:53.601
All right.

18:54.402 --> 18:56.638
- Russ, what are
you doing in there?

18:57.739 --> 18:59.206
- Go check on your brother.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.708
- Yeah, Isaiah's not my brother.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.076
- Go.

19:03.478 --> 19:04.546

21:49.977 --> 21:52.212

What's your name?

22:39.560 --> 22:40.728

22:40.762 --> 22:41.796
No, well what, 'cause the pills?

22:41.829 --> 22:42.997
Bro, they're just like

22:50.905 --> 22:52.039
Listen man, I was probably

22:52.073 --> 22:53.808
just a little bit
younger than you when-

22:58.780 --> 23:00.380
Yeah, I'll be right out.

Hey, look I gotta go

you to stay here,

23:10.525 --> 23:12.827

24:01.509 --> 24:02.009
- Wh..wh..what?

24:02.043 --> 24:03.678

24:03.711 --> 24:05.146
- No, they did it
to Ker, remember?

24:05.179 --> 24:07.915
They arrested his dad
and then they took him.

24:07.949 --> 24:10.117
He ended up having to move
to like Florida or some shit.

24:10.151 --> 24:12.687
- Okay, whoa, who
would take me, who?

24:12.720 --> 24:14.488
- Probably like a foster family

24:14.522 --> 24:16.691
or one of those like
foster houses, man.

24:16.724 --> 24:18.693
I don't fucking know.
- Shit!

24:18.726 --> 24:19.961
- Man, just come with

24:45.219 --> 24:46.153
- Can I have that?

24:47.755 --> 24:48.890
- It's warm though.

24:54.061 --> 24:57.765
- My name is Patty, I work
for Child Protection Services.

24:57.798 --> 24:59.033
The police officer
outside called me

24:59.066 --> 25:00.835
to come in and help you.

25:00.868 --> 25:02.670
I have your little
brother in my car now.

25:02.703 --> 25:03.871
- He's not my little brother.

25:03.905 --> 25:05.740
- Is he your stepbrother then?

25:05.773 --> 25:07.975
- I guess, he's like
my half brother.

25:11.045 --> 25:12.513
- Do you drink beer a lot?

25:13.915 --> 25:16.050
It's the only thing
my husband drinks.

25:16.984 --> 25:18.619
- My dad drinks.

25:18.653 --> 25:19.921
- Does he drink a lot?

25:21.589 --> 25:22.456
- I don't know.

25:26.060 --> 25:28.896
- I understand you
saw your dad outside,

25:28.930 --> 25:30.564
I'm sorry you had to see that.

25:30.598 --> 25:33.834
- Yeah, well, I've seen
him in trouble before.

25:33.868 --> 25:35.169
- What kind of trouble?

25:35.202 --> 25:38.005
- I saw him get arrested
for like a DUI one time.

25:38.039 --> 25:41.976
- Okay, were you in the car
when that happened to him?

25:42.009 --> 25:43.711
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was,

25:44.545 --> 25:46.080
well I punched this
guy Nate in my class,

25:46.113 --> 25:49.450
and I got suspended for three
days and he had to pick me up.

25:50.017 --> 25:53.120
- Okay, why'd you punch him?

25:53.154 --> 25:55.022
- Well, he called my
friend Steve a bitch.

25:55.056 --> 25:58.092
Yeah, and I'm like, Steve's
only friend at school, so.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.694
- So Steve's your friend?

26:00.861 --> 26:02.630
- Yeah, yeah, he's
my best friend.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.235
- Do you have any other family
here, your birth mother?

26:09.203 --> 26:15.977
- Oh, I haven't seen her in
a while, like a long time.

26:16.777 --> 26:19.113
- Okay, do you know how long?

26:19.146 --> 26:21.716
- I don't know, like
four years or something.

26:22.616 --> 26:25.619
- Okay, so I wanna tell you
a little bit about what I do.

26:26.587 --> 26:29.256
I'm here as an
advocate for you, okay.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.858
Do you know what an advocate is?

26:30.891 --> 26:32.026
- No.

26:32.059 --> 26:33.728
- It means I'm on your team.

26:34.895 --> 26:36.063
I'm gonna make sure
that you are safe

26:36.097 --> 26:38.833
and that we take
care of you, okay?

26:39.333 --> 26:41.702
- Like you'll take me
to a foster family?

26:43.871 --> 26:45.272
- Did someone say that to you?

26:49.944 --> 26:51.045
- Can I talk to
you for a second?

26:51.078 --> 26:53.114
- Yeah, sure.

26:53.147 --> 26:54.915
Tommy, I'll be right back.

26:54.949 --> 26:55.983
What I want you
to do is pick out

26:56.017 --> 26:56.951
some of the things
here in your room

26:56.984 --> 26:59.120
that you really wanna
take with you, okay?

26:59.153 --> 27:01.288
You can put him on the
bed here in a pile.

27:01.322 --> 27:03.591
You're gonna come with me, okay?

27:03.624 --> 27:04.725
- Yes, ma'am.

27:04.759 --> 27:07.762
- You know your little brother
needs you too right now.

27:07.795 --> 27:08.696
He's upset.

27:10.965 --> 27:13.000
- Well, he likes his hammer.

27:13.034 --> 27:16.037
He like to chew on it and
hit with it and stuff.

27:16.070 --> 27:18.239
- Okay, I'll be right back.

27:18.272 --> 27:19.306
- Okay.

27:24.045 --> 27:27.081

28:38.752 --> 28:39.887
- Go, go, go.

28:47.795 --> 28:50.264

28:50.297 --> 28:53.167
- I don't know, maybe the park.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.702
What's even open right now?

28:55.736 --> 28:56.904
- The mini golf place,

28:56.937 --> 28:59.039
that's the only thing I can
think that's open this late.

28:59.073 --> 28:59.874
- Let's give it a shot.

28:59.907 --> 29:02.143
- All right.

29:05.012 --> 29:06.080
- Fort Randall,

29:06.113 --> 29:07.348
- Come on, hey, let's go
through the electric field.

29:07.381 --> 29:10.751
- No, no, no, hey we'll get
electrocuted, we can't do that.

29:11.352 --> 29:13.087
Come on to Fort
Randall, let's go.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.255

30:13.047 --> 30:14.915

All right, they won't touch you.

30:23.891 --> 30:26.794
- 57 Posse.

30:29.230 --> 30:31.065
We don't even need parents.

31:28.155 --> 31:30.924
- I'm so hungry,

31:30.958 --> 31:32.460
- What should we get?

31:32.494 --> 31:34.395
- Well, we can get whatever
we want, yes sir.

31:34.429 --> 31:36.163
- I'm gonna get the number six.
-Yeah.

31:38.198 --> 31:39.300
- Excuse me.

31:40.234 --> 31:41.835

31:41.869 --> 31:42.404
- Oh shit.

31:42.437 --> 31:43.471
- Where's my dog at?

31:43.505 --> 31:44.572
- We ain't seen a dog.

31:44.606 --> 31:45.473
- Man, let's go.

32:03.324 --> 32:04.892
- You can't eat all that.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.093
- Yeah, I can.

32:06.126 --> 32:07.328
- Put too much salt on.

32:07.361 --> 32:08.362
- I like salt.

32:08.395 --> 32:09.363
- Well, not that much salt, man.

32:09.396 --> 32:11.365
That's just like salt.

32:11.398 --> 32:13.934
- Like pure salt, you're
gonna get sick.

32:14.469 --> 32:17.338
- You guys think we're gonna
be friends when we're old?

32:17.371 --> 32:18.573
Like grownups?

32:20.374 --> 32:22.444
- That's a random
question, but yeah.

32:23.344 --> 32:26.046
- We're not friends, all
right, we're cousins.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.348
- Don't touch my fries O'Neill.

32:27.381 --> 32:29.216
I thought there were
too salty anyway.

32:29.249 --> 32:30.317
- Man, shut up.

32:30.351 --> 32:31.185
All right you didn't
even pay for it.

32:31.218 --> 32:33.087
- You think she's
gonna find her dog?

32:33.120 --> 32:34.422
- She ain't got it dog, man.

32:34.456 --> 32:36.390
- Yeah, I bet she ate
her dog.

32:41.028 --> 32:43.163
Hey, I'm gonna eat that!

32:43.197 --> 32:44.064
- Bro, you have like
four other ones.

32:44.098 --> 32:45.199
Bro, you'll be alright.

32:45.232 --> 32:46.300
- Bro, you got four burgers
in front of you, shut up.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.437
- That doesn't mean
anything, I'm fucking hungry.

33:02.182 --> 33:03.485
- What?

33:03.518 --> 33:07.087
- I wanted to see

33:07.121 --> 33:09.390
or if you're hungry or anything?

33:12.192 --> 33:15.028
- Yeah, just put
it on the ground,

33:15.630 --> 33:17.499
just put it on the ground there.

33:17.532 --> 33:20.167
My dog will eat
it, he'll eat it.

33:35.315 --> 33:37.084
- Did you give her
my burger, man?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.523
- You think they're
gonna arrest me now?

33:41.556 --> 33:43.257
- No, just don't
let them catch you.

33:43.290 --> 33:45.259
- Yeah, my dad's
straight up says like,

33:45.292 --> 33:47.629
once you stop moving, you die.

33:47.662 --> 33:50.432
Just don't let anyone catch
you, you'll be good.

33:52.534 --> 33:54.268
You guys wanna

33:54.301 --> 33:55.437
- Well, Steve got

33:55.470 --> 33:56.671
and he threw his
club at that girl.

33:56.704 --> 33:58.138
- Yeah, I didn't
throw it at her.

34:00.040 --> 34:00.842
It did hit her.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.445
- Oh, it did,

Hey, yo boys,

34:12.454 --> 34:13.387

Not real as big Kelly though.

I saw Britt was feeling us.

34:22.262 --> 34:23.230
- Bro, whatever, dude, stop.

34:23.263 --> 34:24.732

He's lost like every fight.

36:25.285 --> 36:27.822

this kid on foot all night.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.757
Okay, what is he doing,
I'm trying to help him?

36:29.791 --> 36:31.258
- He doesn't know that.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.696
- Why do you think that is?

36:34.729 --> 36:36.296
- Officer, I just
need your help.

36:36.330 --> 36:39.867
- No look, it doesn't
even matter, I can't.

36:39.901 --> 36:42.537
Okay, so I'm happy to give
you a ride back to your car,

36:42.570 --> 36:43.838

36:43.871 --> 36:45.773
I got a kid of my own at home.

36:46.474 --> 36:49.309
- Well, it is my
job to keep looking.

36:49.343 --> 36:50.344
I have a scared toddler

36:50.377 --> 36:53.146
crying for his brother
in my office right now.

36:54.749 --> 36:56.751
He's just a scared kid.

37:02.490 --> 37:04.224

37:49.537 --> 37:51.271
- You know, there
were more of them.

37:51.304 --> 37:52.774
- Tommy, you didn't
even do anything.

37:53.975 --> 37:55.843
All right, shut the
fuck up about it.

37:59.847 --> 38:01.248
I mean what the fuck, Steve?

38:01.281 --> 38:02.417
- Aw, bro.

38:02.450 --> 38:04.384
- You're not supposed to run
for an hour after you eat.

38:04.419 --> 38:05.520
- That's swimming, dumb ass.

38:05.553 --> 38:06.587
- What did I tell you though?

38:06.621 --> 38:09.991
I told you not to eat all
those damn burgers, dude.

38:10.024 --> 38:11.926
- Six burgers, is
that what you had?

38:11.959 --> 38:15.262
- Hey,
what's that?

38:15.295 --> 38:18.298
- Damn, she's hot.

38:19.701 --> 38:20.735
Tommy, that's your mom, man.

38:20.768 --> 38:22.637
- Oh what, no, no, no
then that's your mom, bro.

38:22.670 --> 38:23.805
- That's the same chick.

38:23.838 --> 38:24.739
- Oh no it ain't.

38:24.772 --> 38:27.542
- Yes, she's got
different panties on, man.

38:27.575 --> 38:29.610
Look, I don't even
want a mom anyway.

38:29.644 --> 38:31.946
Now y'all take that shit.
- All right man.

38:34.682 --> 38:37.384
- Oh, that's my mom.

38:37.418 --> 38:38.953
- Nah, give me that.

38:41.022 --> 38:42.322
That's my mom.

38:46.293 --> 38:47.862
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- I was looking at that.

38:47.895 --> 38:49.931
- Man, fuck parents, remember?

38:50.631 --> 38:51.999
Man, we should like-
I don't know

38:52.033 --> 38:55.470
we gotta stay somewhere like
a motel room or something.

38:55.503 --> 38:56.336
- Yeah, you know what?

38:56.369 --> 38:57.171
That's a really good idea.

38:57.205 --> 38:58.873
Hey, we get a motel
room, all right.

38:58.906 --> 38:59.707
Then we find Britt and them,

38:59.741 --> 39:00.875
and we go swimming
at their place.

39:00.908 --> 39:01.709
- And we got the card too,

39:01.743 --> 39:02.744
so we can like
actually get a room.

39:02.777 --> 39:04.846
- Right, okay.
- If the motel has a swim pool,

39:04.879 --> 39:05.813
we can go swimming,

39:05.847 --> 39:06.781
get a bunch of shit from
the vending machine.

39:06.814 --> 39:09.784
- Yeah, I like that, all
right, y'all ready?

39:09.817 --> 39:13.353
- And we gonna need like
an adult though, huh?

39:13.386 --> 39:14.889
- Fuck, fuck.

39:19.761 --> 39:20.928
- We need a mom.

39:31.672 --> 39:32.907
- Did you find my dog?

39:35.443 --> 39:36.511
- Will you be my mom?

39:55.797 --> 39:56.931
- Looking for the Coke machine?

39:56.964 --> 39:59.433
- That's a Pepsi
machine out there.

39:59.467 --> 40:00.501
- So?

40:00.535 --> 40:02.369
- No, we don't want Pepsi.

40:02.937 --> 40:04.772
- The hot tub's broken,
it's been broken for a year.

40:04.806 --> 40:06.007
So if you wanna
burn off some sugar,

40:06.040 --> 40:07.675
you go across the
street to Steak Burger.

40:07.708 --> 40:08.876
- We already went
to Steak Burger.

40:08.910 --> 40:11.479
- Yeah, we just
want a room for us.

40:11.512 --> 40:12.580
- Do you have parents?

40:13.815 --> 40:15.817
- Yeah, she's out
there in the car.

40:17.451 --> 40:18.385
- That's your mom?

40:19.821 --> 40:20.855
- Yeah.

40:23.090 --> 40:23.925
- Mm-hmm.

40:23.958 --> 40:25.059
- She smoking a ciggy.

40:25.092 --> 40:26.427
- What kind of
cigarette she smoke?

40:26.460 --> 40:27.028
- She rolls her own.

40:27.061 --> 40:28.129
- What, 84 millimeters?

40:28.162 --> 40:29.831
- King size slim.

40:29.864 --> 40:31.398
- You smoke?
- No.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.503
I'm gonna need an ID for that.

40:35.536 --> 40:38.940
- Oh, I don't think,
I think she lost it.

40:38.973 --> 40:40.408
Yeah, she loses it all the time.

40:41.275 --> 40:42.944
- Not 2000 milligrams.
- Stop, hey.

40:42.977 --> 40:44.612
- Let go of me, let go!

40:44.645 --> 40:45.947

40:53.154 --> 40:55.623
-Shut your mouth, piece of shit!

40:55.656 --> 40:57.925
- Yo,

Fuck you!

41:02.864 --> 41:05.398

special, $49 a night.

41:05.433 --> 41:07.134
You boys just gotta

41:09.837 --> 41:10.872

42:46.233 --> 42:48.502
<i>- I like a lonely boy.</i>

42:49.670 --> 42:50.805
- No, I don't know what to do.

42:50.838 --> 42:52.840
<i>- You can start by

42:52.873 --> 42:54.041
<i>You wanna do me, don't you.</i>

42:54.075 --> 42:55.242
- Yeah, but I am.

42:56.544 --> 42:59.847
I was running tonight,
running from a cop.

43:00.681 --> 43:03.084
<i>- Running from
cops makes me so wet.</i>

43:03.117 --> 43:04.986
<i>Did you do something bad?</i>

43:05.019 --> 43:07.488
- See, I don't know,
I don't think so.

43:08.089 --> 43:09.824
I think they're gonna take
me to a foster family,

43:09.857 --> 43:11.192
but I don't want to.

43:15.196 --> 43:16.063
Hello?

43:16.998 --> 43:18.299
<i>- Is this you again?

<i>- You can't call this
number unless you're 18.</i>

43:21.836 --> 43:22.970
- No, no, no, no, no, just wait.

43:23.004 --> 43:24.038
Don't hang up please.

43:25.673 --> 43:26.540
<i>- What?</i>

43:28.576 --> 43:32.246
- I just, my friends think
you look like your picture.

43:33.247 --> 43:35.716
<i>- I do, I look
exactly like that.</i>

43:35.750 --> 43:37.184
- Oh really, yeah, that's cool.

43:38.686 --> 43:39.286
<i>- I gotta go.</i>

43:39.320 --> 43:41.022
- Tonight's my last night.

43:42.023 --> 43:43.758
<i>- Hmm, what
does that mean?</i>

43:45.126 --> 43:50.031
- I just, there's
this girl that,

43:50.731 --> 43:53.167
I like her, I've liked her
for a couple grades now.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.169
And I want to ask
you for some advice,

43:55.202 --> 43:58.005
'cause I don't know what to do.

43:58.039 --> 44:00.041
<i>- Why are you
telling me, go tell her?</i>

44:00.074 --> 44:02.576
- Well, my friend likes her too,

44:02.610 --> 44:05.146
and I don't know if she
likes me or anything.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.248
<i>- You know what?</i>

44:07.281 --> 44:08.549
<i>Your friend doesn't own her.</i>

44:08.582 --> 44:11.719
<i>So if you don't tell her,
then she'll never know.</i>

44:11.752 --> 44:13.120
<i>People don't know things
unless you tell 'em,</i>

44:13.154 --> 44:16.824
<i>and you don't know if someone
likes you until you kiss 'em.</i>

44:16.857 --> 44:18.325
<i>You know how to kiss a girl?</i>

44:20.361 --> 44:21.328
- Yeah.

44:21.362 --> 44:22.596
<i>- So go do
what you wanna do,</i>

44:22.630 --> 44:24.632
<i>'cause there's a whole world
gonna make you do shit</i>

44:24.665 --> 44:25.833
<i>you don't wanna do.</i>

44:25.866 --> 44:28.736
<i>My first kiss was with
some guy</i>

44:28.769 --> 44:29.637
- All right.

44:30.938 --> 44:32.006
- Hey bro, but,

44:33.107 --> 44:35.076

44:35.109 --> 44:37.044
- Hey, that guy knocked you out.

44:37.078 --> 44:38.646
- He didn't knock me
out, all right man.

44:38.679 --> 44:40.181
I'll knock you out boy.
- Stop, come on.

44:40.214 --> 44:41.082
I told you I don't
fucking like that.

44:41.115 --> 44:41.949
- What you gonna do?

44:41.982 --> 44:44.251
- Guys, guys, I
need the motel room.

44:45.086 --> 44:47.188
- I'll go get us
a room right now.

44:50.191 --> 44:52.126
- Hey, I have a little
bit at home I think,

44:52.159 --> 44:54.328
my dad hides cash in his
underwear drawer sometimes.

44:54.361 --> 44:56.697
- Tommy, you can't
go back there, man.

44:56.730 --> 44:57.932
They'll arrest you.

44:57.965 --> 44:58.833
And I probably arrest us too

44:58.866 --> 45:01.202
for like resisting
arrest or some shit.

45:02.303 --> 45:04.406
And they took Isaiah,
they took your dad.

45:04.439 --> 45:05.106
I saw it.

45:07.074 --> 45:09.310
- Guys the keyhole's too small.

45:11.979 --> 45:13.114
- Your paper route.

45:13.147 --> 45:14.215
- I can't even
deliver it tomorrow.

45:14.248 --> 45:16.050
- No, no, no fuck delivering.

45:16.083 --> 45:18.219
You just go collect
all the money tonight

45:18.252 --> 45:20.254
and you just keep it, that's it.

45:22.123 --> 45:23.657
How many papers
do you deliver?

45:23.691 --> 45:25.025
- Like 135.

45:25.059 --> 45:26.093
- Right, right,
and how much money

45:26.127 --> 45:28.062
does each person give you?

45:28.095 --> 45:29.864
- Eight bucks.

45:29.897 --> 45:31.031
- Dude, that's like a $1000.

45:31.065 --> 45:31.866
- Wait dude that's great.

45:31.899 --> 45:32.967
- That's like $1000
fucking dollars.

45:33.000 --> 45:33.801
- No, nobody's gonna be
giving me money right now,

45:33.834 --> 45:37.338
it's like a week early guys.
- So?

45:37.371 --> 45:38.939

45:42.743 --> 45:43.878
Are we going with that?

58:50.097 --> 58:50.965

58:51.999 --> 58:54.101

a sour kind,

58:54.135 --> 58:55.970

PSO or something.

59:02.043 --> 59:03.611
Yeah, I've seen it.

59:06.013 --> 59:07.548

59:09.183 --> 59:10.084

59:10.117 --> 59:13.154

59:22.697 --> 59:25.633
Go on, like she was filming you.

59:25.666 --> 59:27.168

- Yeah.

59:29.103 --> 59:29.937
Oh, shit.

59:34.976 --> 59:35.943
Oh, you think you

59:37.244 --> 59:40.781
Hey, I didn't say you can
walk away from me boy.

59:40.815 --> 59:44.051
Oh yeah, yeah!

59:44.085 --> 59:45.753

59:55.596 --> 59:59.934

1:00:30.765 --> 1:00:31.999
- I know you didn't see nothing.

1:00:32.033 --> 1:00:33.300

1:00:50.051 --> 1:00:51.052
- It's not funny, dude.

1:00:51.085 --> 1:00:52.153
- Talking all that shit.

1:00:52.186 --> 1:00:54.822
- Well, you look stupid

1:00:54.855 --> 1:00:56.290

1:00:58.893 --> 1:01:00.194
- Stop it.

1:01:00.995 --> 1:01:02.997
You look so funny.

1:01:17.178 --> 1:01:19.146

1:01:19.180 --> 1:01:20.614

1:01:29.190 --> 1:01:30.658

- Did y'all like plan

1:02:25.447 --> 1:02:26.113
- No.

1:02:26.147 --> 1:02:27.982
- Oh yes, that's little Steve.

1:02:28.015 --> 1:02:29.350
- It's just Steve.

1:02:29.383 --> 1:02:30.985
And I'm actually average type.

1:02:31.018 --> 1:02:32.386
- Keep telling yourself that.

1:02:32.420 --> 1:02:34.722
- Hey, Maya.
- Hey, Tommy.

1:02:34.755 --> 1:02:36.790
- Mr. Boyd made me run
the students door register

1:02:36.824 --> 1:02:39.927
once you left, and I lost
five bucks from the till,

1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:40.895
so he fired me.

1:02:40.928 --> 1:02:45.433
- He's so anal about
that, but it's whatever.

1:02:45.467 --> 1:02:47.201
I have like a week
and then I can go back

1:02:47.234 --> 1:02:49.203
and fix whatever you messed up.

1:02:50.137 --> 1:02:53.073
- Wait, like a week until
you're done with the?

1:02:53.107 --> 1:02:53.974
- Chemo.

1:02:54.008 --> 1:02:56.010
- Yeah, yeah, chemo, yeah.

1:02:56.043 --> 1:02:56.877
- Yeah.

1:02:56.911 --> 1:02:58.345
- Sarah was telling
me at school, so.

1:02:58.379 --> 1:02:59.414
- Yeah.

1:02:59.447 --> 1:03:02.149
- Tommy, what's with those
stupid ass clothes, man?

1:03:02.183 --> 1:03:02.983
- Oh nah.

1:03:03.017 --> 1:03:04.985
- Okay, so we just
snuck out tonight

1:03:05.019 --> 1:03:06.053
to call this phone sex number.

1:03:06.086 --> 1:03:06.921
- What?
- What?

1:03:06.954 --> 1:03:07.955
- Yeah, what's that?

1:03:07.988 --> 1:03:09.356
- It's just like
a number you call,

1:03:09.390 --> 1:03:10.891
and then we found
this payphone, right?

1:03:10.925 --> 1:03:12.726
- I, found it like a week ago.

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:14.429
- Yeah, and then this chick
just talks dirty to you,

1:03:14.462 --> 1:03:16.997
you could say anything you
want about sex and stuff.

1:03:17.031 --> 1:03:17.898
- Shh, my dad.

1:03:17.932 --> 1:03:18.933
- Try to keep it down, man.

1:03:18.966 --> 1:03:20.901
- So that's when we saw
you guys at the hot tub,

1:03:20.935 --> 1:03:21.735
and then Dave called the cops.

1:03:21.769 --> 1:03:23.204
- Wait, he actually
called the cops?

1:03:23.237 --> 1:03:24.138
- Yes.
- Damn.

1:03:24.171 --> 1:03:25.105
- I mean we thought he did.

1:03:25.139 --> 1:03:27.041
And then the cops showed
up to Tommy's place,

1:03:27.074 --> 1:03:28.209
and then they arrested his dad.

1:03:28.242 --> 1:03:30.177
- Steve!
- What, it's crazy.

1:03:30.211 --> 1:03:31.413
So like we run from the cops,

1:03:31.446 --> 1:03:32.614
and then we went
to Steak Burger.

1:03:32.647 --> 1:03:35.282
And the reason we're wearing
O'Neill's stinky ass clothes

1:03:35.316 --> 1:03:37.084
is because someone stole our
laundry, and we saw the guy.

1:03:37.117 --> 1:03:38.085
- Shh.
- Shh.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:40.187
- And we saw the guy
that stole my Cap jersey,

1:03:40.221 --> 1:03:42.189
he punched the
shit outta O'Neill.

1:03:42.223 --> 1:03:43.290
- Wait, you got hit?

1:03:43.324 --> 1:03:45.493
- Man, whatever all right,
it wasn't even like that.

1:03:45.527 --> 1:03:47.094
- Yeah, you probably
deserved it.

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:49.930
- He did, and then we went
to go get a motel room.

1:03:49.964 --> 1:03:52.066
- Oh yeah, and we used
the dog lady, that lady.

1:03:52.099 --> 1:03:54.034
- The lady, that's
always out by her car?

1:03:54.068 --> 1:03:55.769
- Yeah, and then she went crazy.

1:03:55.803 --> 1:03:58.072
So the motel after that
would only take cash, right?

1:03:58.105 --> 1:04:01.308
So then Tommy had to collect
money from his paper route.

1:04:01.342 --> 1:04:03.110
And then these guys,
these big, buff guys

1:04:03.143 --> 1:04:04.345
pulled him into their apartment.

1:04:04.378 --> 1:04:06.981
- They put me into
their apartment,

1:04:07.014 --> 1:04:08.983
took my money and shit.

1:04:09.950 --> 1:04:12.086
- Man, that's not what happened.

1:04:12.119 --> 1:04:14.321
Tell them what happened,
dude, it's funny.

1:04:15.089 --> 1:04:16.390
- Stop it.

1:04:19.193 --> 1:04:20.495
- He peed his pants.

1:04:20.528 --> 1:04:21.563
- Ewe Tommy, what the fuck?

1:04:21.596 --> 1:04:23.130
- Wait, you actually
pissed yourself?

1:04:23.163 --> 1:04:24.098
- Gross.

1:04:24.131 --> 1:04:25.833
- No, I didn't, it
wasn't like that, look.

1:04:25.866 --> 1:04:27.167
- Oh shit, that's my dad.

1:04:27.201 --> 1:04:27.901
You guys gotta get
in the pool, go.

1:04:27.935 --> 1:04:30.104
Get in the pool,
get in the pool.

1:04:30.137 --> 1:04:31.272
- Shit.
- Fuck.

1:04:36.877 --> 1:04:37.545
- Hi, dad.

1:04:37.579 --> 1:04:39.947
- Hey, Mr..

1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:41.416
- I'm going to bed, honey.

1:04:41.982 --> 1:04:42.983
- Night.

1:04:49.557 --> 1:04:52.026
- That was just my
dad, he's going to bed.

1:04:52.059 --> 1:04:53.127
- Should we stay in the pool?

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:54.895
- No stupid, get
out of the pool.

1:04:58.566 --> 1:05:00.167
- Hey, is your
dad gonna hear us?

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.437
- No, he sleeps with this like
tornado sound thingy,

1:05:02.470 --> 1:05:04.572
so he doesn't really
hear anything.

1:05:04.606 --> 1:05:05.473
- Okay.

1:05:09.376 --> 1:05:11.011
- I mean it's still warm.

1:05:11.045 --> 1:05:13.347
Don't be doing that.

1:05:13.380 --> 1:05:15.082
- You're so stupid.

1:05:15.115 --> 1:05:16.418
-That's what I've been saying.

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:21.088
- You little dumb ass.

1:05:21.121 --> 1:05:22.022
- Dumb ass.

1:05:24.191 --> 1:05:25.159
- Can I touch it?

1:05:32.199 --> 1:05:33.133
It's smooth.

1:05:33.167 --> 1:05:34.368
- Yeah, no shit.

1:05:34.401 --> 1:05:36.236
- Hey , why you always
talking shit?

1:05:36.270 --> 1:05:37.938
- Shut up Steve,
don't you got a home?

1:05:37.971 --> 1:05:40.408
- No, that's why I'm
stuck with his little ass.

1:05:41.342 --> 1:05:43.445
- It looks good on you.

1:06:05.999 --> 1:06:07.635
- Marco.
- Polo.

1:06:08.235 --> 1:06:10.070
- Marco.
-Polo.

1:06:10.104 --> 1:06:11.372
- Marco.
-Polo.

1:06:26.253 --> 1:06:27.622
- Marco.
-Polo.

1:06:27.655 --> 1:06:28.690
- Marco.

1:06:28.723 --> 1:06:29.491
- Polo.

1:06:31.693 --> 1:06:32.660
- Marco.

1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:34.161
- Polo.

1:06:35.028 --> 1:06:36.029
- Polo.

1:06:48.543 --> 1:06:50.512
- Marco.
- Polo.

1:06:56.016 --> 1:06:58.018
Yes.

1:07:04.358 --> 1:07:05.693
- It's the shallow water.

1:07:05.727 --> 1:07:06.960
- So!

1:07:12.366 --> 1:07:13.568
- Marco.

1:07:13.601 --> 1:07:15.169
- Hey, don't open your eyes.

1:07:15.202 --> 1:07:16.538
- I didn't you fucking narc.

1:07:16.571 --> 1:07:19.106
- You did open your eyes.
- Fuck off.

1:07:19.641 --> 1:07:20.340
Marco.

1:07:20.374 --> 1:07:21.543
- Polo

1:07:24.412 --> 1:07:26.448
- Marco.
- Polo.

1:07:27.314 --> 1:07:29.116
- Hey, player.

1:07:47.167 --> 1:07:50.204
- But that isn't like
the only reason why,

1:07:51.338 --> 1:07:52.407
you know, my brother
went off to college

1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:53.641
and then he got
really depressed.

1:07:53.675 --> 1:07:56.343
So that's why we're
going on this vacation,

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:57.645
which I guess is good.

1:07:59.346 --> 1:08:00.615
You know, I was
gonna surprise him

1:08:00.648 --> 1:08:01.516
with all his old Pokemon cards

1:08:01.549 --> 1:08:02.550
he used to play with
when he was a kid.

1:08:02.584 --> 1:08:05.052
- I used to play Pokemon
cards too all the time.

1:08:05.085 --> 1:08:06.788
See, I thought
Charizard was the shit,

1:08:06.821 --> 1:08:10.357
I had like this special
edition card and.

1:08:11.091 --> 1:08:12.694
You don't even know what
I'm talking about, do you?

1:08:12.727 --> 1:08:15.229
- What, okay, I know Pokemon.

1:08:16.230 --> 1:08:17.130
I was the one that
beat my brother.

1:08:17.164 --> 1:08:18.131
- Oh.

1:08:18.165 --> 1:08:20.334
- Hm-hmm. Yeah, I was
obsessed with Mewtwo.

1:08:20.367 --> 1:08:22.035
- Okay, I see you.

1:08:22.069 --> 1:08:24.071
See, I don't even think
I have mine anymore.

1:08:24.104 --> 1:08:28.342
- Damn, I was gonna say you
could bring some over sometime.

1:08:28.375 --> 1:08:29.343
- Oh, then I'll
find those quick.

1:08:29.376 --> 1:08:30.478
- Ah, okay.

1:08:37.284 --> 1:08:40.555
So, what now?

1:08:43.424 --> 1:08:44.659
- I don't know.

1:08:47.261 --> 1:08:48.730
Actually, I don't know.

1:08:49.531 --> 1:08:53.735
- Yeah, we could play
Marco polo again.

1:08:53.768 --> 1:08:54.869
- Could we play it for
three days straight?

1:08:54.903 --> 1:08:57.271
- And just get all shriveled
up and eat in the pool?

1:08:57.304 --> 1:08:58.338
- Exactly.

1:08:58.372 --> 1:08:59.172
- Where you gonna sleep?

1:08:59.206 --> 1:09:00.775
- See, I don't
even need to sleep.

1:09:00.808 --> 1:09:01.543
- Sure.

1:09:01.576 --> 1:09:02.677
- I'm gonna bounce.

1:09:03.444 --> 1:09:04.344
- Right now?

1:09:04.378 --> 1:09:05.847
- Why?

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.114
- 'Cause.

1:09:07.147 --> 1:09:07.815
- Don't go yet.

1:09:07.849 --> 1:09:09.149
- Come on man, what you doing.

1:09:09.182 --> 1:09:09.951
Way to kill a party man.

1:09:09.984 --> 1:09:10.518
- Yeah O'Neill,
what about Tommy?

1:09:10.552 --> 1:09:11.385
- You can't stay here.

1:09:11.419 --> 1:09:12.252
- What, just 'cause
he can't go home?

1:09:12.286 --> 1:09:14.121
- You don't have to
say it like that.

1:09:14.154 --> 1:09:15.088
- Steve, let's go.

1:09:19.159 --> 1:09:20.562
- I'll tell you when
you can kiss me.

1:09:20.595 --> 1:09:21.829
- Damn.
- Yeah.

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:34.676
- Okay, bye Tommy.

1:09:36.209 --> 1:09:38.746
- Okay, bye Britt.

1:09:41.583 --> 1:09:43.183
All right, see you.

1:09:46.721 --> 1:09:48.221
Yo, yo, guys, hey, wait up.

1:09:48.690 --> 1:09:50.425
Let put my shoes on.

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:51.859
- Let me too.
- Okay.

1:09:52.860 --> 1:09:54.194
Hey that was fun, wasn't it?

1:09:54.227 --> 1:09:54.862
- Bro really.

1:09:54.896 --> 1:09:55.763
- Yes sir.

1:09:57.264 --> 1:09:58.231
All right.

1:09:58.265 --> 1:09:59.867
- These socks man.

1:10:00.668 --> 1:10:03.504
- Yo man, did you
guys see that shit?

1:10:03.538 --> 1:10:04.405
It was the coolest shit ever.

1:10:04.439 --> 1:10:05.305
- Man, it would've been cool

1:10:05.339 --> 1:10:07.174
if you like French
kissed or something.

1:10:07.207 --> 1:10:08.108
- Shut up man.

1:10:09.811 --> 1:10:11.679
- Hey, don't tell
him to shut up.

1:10:12.312 --> 1:10:13.146
- What?

1:10:13.180 --> 1:10:14.549
- Shut up man,
what's talking about?

1:10:14.582 --> 1:10:15.416
- Don't tell me to shut up!

1:10:15.450 --> 1:10:16.451
- O'Neill, what the fuck?

1:10:16.484 --> 1:10:17.619
- Shut up Steve.

1:10:18.586 --> 1:10:19.319
Back off.

1:10:19.353 --> 1:10:20.455
- No, you back up,

1:10:20.488 --> 1:10:22.690
you always think your tough man,
I'm not scared of you.

1:10:22.724 --> 1:10:23.591
- Come on guys, stop, stop.

1:10:28.596 --> 1:10:30.632
Oh, shit, shit.

1:10:31.833 --> 1:10:34.602
- Hey, get off him O'Neill.
- Fuck you!

1:10:34.636 --> 1:10:37.204
- Steve help!
- O'Neill stop!

1:10:37.237 --> 1:10:38.238
O'Neill stop!

1:10:41.341 --> 1:10:43.210
Let go, oh, get off of him!

1:10:43.243 --> 1:10:45.880
- Don't, all right,
you're my cousin.

1:10:47.381 --> 1:10:49.216
- Shit!
- Fuck, fuck!

1:10:54.555 --> 1:10:55.923
Man, I fucking told you.

1:10:59.393 --> 1:11:00.260
Steve, let's go.

1:11:02.362 --> 1:11:03.831
- Man, why'd you do that?

1:11:03.865 --> 1:11:06.901
- We can go or you can go
to fucking foster care too.

1:11:09.937 --> 1:11:10.938
- Fuck!

1:11:12.907 --> 1:11:13.975
Fuck!

1:12:10.465 --> 1:12:12.633
<i>- You've called
1-800-Hot-Nite .</i>

1:12:12.667 --> 1:12:15.837
<i>I'm so horny, and I've
been waiting for you.</i>

1:12:16.604 --> 1:12:18.271
<i>What took you so long?</i>

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:20.441
<i>Is someone there?</i>

1:12:20.808 --> 1:12:23.978
- It's me, don't
hang up, please.

1:12:24.011 --> 1:12:25.613
<i>I have the card number.
- Kid.</i>

1:12:25.646 --> 1:12:26.647
- No, no, no, take it, take it.

1:12:26.681 --> 1:12:30.383
I have it, it's 4500-1234-56-

1:12:30.418 --> 1:12:33.521
<i>- Stop, stop, stop.
Breathe okay.</i>

1:12:34.922 --> 1:12:36.457
<i>Tell me your name again.</i>

1:12:37.525 --> 1:12:39.026
- Tommy.

1:12:44.432 --> 1:12:48.401
They took him, 'cause
of the drugs or whatever.

1:12:48.436 --> 1:12:49.871
They took him.

1:12:49.904 --> 1:12:52.774
<i>- Wait, what
took who, Tommy?</i>

1:12:52.807 --> 1:12:56.343
- My dad, the cops arrested
him, and messed up.

1:12:56.376 --> 1:12:58.679
They took my little brother,
I ran with my friends

1:12:58.713 --> 1:13:00.481
and we tried to get money.

1:13:00.515 --> 1:13:04.852
And I went into an apartment

1:13:04.886 --> 1:13:08.288
and these guys made me
scared, I peed myself.

1:13:08.923 --> 1:13:13.528
I fucking peed all over
myself, and I kissed her.

1:13:14.529 --> 1:13:16.831
The girl, Britt, I kissed her.

1:13:16.864 --> 1:13:18.533
<i>- Okay, Tommy,
I hear you .</i>

1:13:18.566 --> 1:13:19.767
<i>I hear you, okay.</i>

1:13:19.801 --> 1:13:21.836
<i>Just breathe a second and
tell me what happened.</i>

1:13:21.869 --> 1:13:22.970
- Nah, I am telling you.

1:13:23.004 --> 1:13:25.640
I'm telling you,
they beat me up,

1:13:25.673 --> 1:13:26.808
they just started punching me.

1:13:26.841 --> 1:13:29.911
Just wanted them, and Steve
didn't do nothing stop it.

1:13:31.779 --> 1:13:34.015
Now it was O'Neill, he hit me.

1:13:34.048 --> 1:13:36.417
And I can't get the motel room!

1:13:41.088 --> 1:13:43.524
<i>- Tommy.
- What?</i>

1:13:44.425 --> 1:13:46.727
<i>- I need you to tell
me where you're at.</i>

1:14:35.076 --> 1:14:37.945
I look just like that, right?

1:14:39.614 --> 1:14:40.481
- No.

1:14:51.759 --> 1:14:57.465
- So I'm Ava, you're Tommy.

1:15:02.970 --> 1:15:06.040
So like you live
around here, Tommy?

1:15:07.208 --> 1:15:11.545
- Yeah, kind of, just back
down Fourth Plain, that way.

1:15:15.950 --> 1:15:21.122
- So what, like you wanna
go back there or what?

1:15:22.523 --> 1:15:23.824
- I can't.

1:15:23.858 --> 1:15:24.959
- What do you mean you can't?

1:15:24.992 --> 1:15:25.993
- 'Cause they're
gonna take me away.

1:15:26.027 --> 1:15:28.462
I told you that, I said
they're gonna take me.

1:15:28.496 --> 1:15:30.498
- Okay, okay, shit.

1:15:34.535 --> 1:15:37.505
- I'm gonna go to
foster care like Isaiah.

1:15:37.538 --> 1:15:38.639
- Who's Isaiah?

1:15:41.142 --> 1:15:45.012
- He's my stepbrother,
but he's little.

1:15:45.046 --> 1:15:47.515
Like he doesn't even
know what's happening,

1:15:47.548 --> 1:15:50.451
I don't care, I'll run
anyway, you know, I'll run.

1:15:52.586 --> 1:15:54.488
- It don't work like that,

1:15:54.522 --> 1:15:57.525
not like you think
it does, little man.

1:15:57.558 --> 1:15:59.660
You gotta have people
even if you run.

1:16:01.228 --> 1:16:02.196
- Man whatever, why'd you
even come here anyway?

1:16:02.229 --> 1:16:05.132
- You were the one
calling me tonight anyway.

1:16:11.739 --> 1:16:12.974
- Can I try that?

1:16:13.641 --> 1:16:14.575
- No.

1:16:19.146 --> 1:16:21.482
- So your friend
busted you up, huh?

1:16:22.316 --> 1:16:25.052
- Yeah well, he gets
into fights all the time,

1:16:25.086 --> 1:16:26.988
so I had no chance.

1:16:30.791 --> 1:16:32.193
- But you kissed the girl?

1:16:35.830 --> 1:16:37.965
It was good, right?

1:16:47.842 --> 1:16:49.643
- That your boyfriend?

1:16:51.612 --> 1:16:54.715
- He's like the only
guy I could talk into,

1:16:54.749 --> 1:16:56.884
like driving me all the
way the hell over here.

1:16:56.917 --> 1:16:59.186
Like, I don't do this shit.

1:17:00.688 --> 1:17:02.123
Anyway his name's Biggie.

1:17:02.156 --> 1:17:03.357
I guess 'cause he's big,

1:17:03.391 --> 1:17:06.227
but it's better than one of
those names with the guy is big,

1:17:06.260 --> 1:17:08.996
but they call him
like Tiny or whatever,

1:17:09.030 --> 1:17:11.632
like people supposed
to laugh and some shit.

1:17:19.273 --> 1:17:20.608
Come on.

1:17:20.641 --> 1:17:21.876
- Where?

1:17:21.909 --> 1:17:23.844
- Man, you wanna
run away, don't you?

1:17:23.878 --> 1:17:27.214
Then get in the truck, we're
gonna break into your house.

1:17:33.054 --> 1:17:35.189
- All right, you gotta
turn left up here.

1:17:37.925 --> 1:17:39.093
- Yo, get down, down.

1:17:39.126 --> 1:17:40.728
- Are the cops at my house?
- Yes, yes.

1:17:40.761 --> 1:17:41.896
- Stay down.

1:17:41.929 --> 1:17:43.831
- Why are they still here?

1:18:00.081 --> 1:18:01.315
- Yo, yo he's coming?

1:18:01.348 --> 1:18:04.351
- Oh yeah, he's
good, he's coming.

1:18:29.110 --> 1:18:31.712
- All right, go get your stuff.
- All right.

1:20:49.950 --> 1:20:50.518
- Tommy.

1:20:50.552 --> 1:20:51.553
- What are you doing?

1:20:51.586 --> 1:20:54.188
- Hey listen, we're just
looking around, it's not-

1:20:54.221 --> 1:20:56.223
- Don't, don't touch that, no!

1:20:56.257 --> 1:20:58.892
- Get off me.
- Don't push him.

1:20:59.393 --> 1:21:01.563
- Sit down!
- I said don't.

1:21:01.596 --> 1:21:03.163
- Tommy.
- No, don't touch me!

1:21:03.197 --> 1:21:06.434
Get outta my house, get the
fuck outta my house now.

1:21:07.868 --> 1:21:09.270
No, that's my dad's.

1:21:09.303 --> 1:21:10.971
That's my dad's and he's
he's coming back, okay.

1:21:11.005 --> 1:21:11.905
- I know.

1:21:11.939 --> 1:21:12.873
- He's coming back,
you can't take that.

1:21:12.906 --> 1:21:14.808
- Wait, I'll tell him
to put it back okay.

1:21:14.842 --> 1:21:16.310
Yo, put it back.

1:21:16.343 --> 1:21:18.178
I said fucking put it back.

1:21:18.212 --> 1:21:19.847
- Tommy.

1:21:20.247 --> 1:21:21.549
- Oh shit.

1:21:21.583 --> 1:21:22.816
- No!

1:21:23.518 --> 1:21:24.318
No!

1:21:24.351 --> 1:21:26.120
- Hey, Tommy, Tommy stop!

1:21:34.496 --> 1:21:35.162
Tommy!

1:21:42.002 --> 1:21:43.438
- Ava come on.

1:21:45.306 --> 1:21:47.107
Get in the fucking car!

1:22:13.601 --> 1:22:16.970
- Tommy no, you'll
get electrocuted.

1:22:23.678 --> 1:22:24.945
Tommy!

1:22:50.538 --> 1:22:54.074
Tommy stop, Tommy
don't, don't!

1:22:59.213 --> 1:23:00.981
- Get off me, get off!

1:23:01.014 --> 1:23:03.217
- Stop moving, I'm
not gonna hurt you!

1:23:03.250 --> 1:23:04.619
- Let go!
- Stop!

1:23:04.652 --> 1:23:06.353
- They're going to take me!

1:23:06.387 --> 1:23:08.623
- Okay, so what?
What?

1:23:09.223 --> 1:23:10.391
What do you want me to do?

1:23:10.425 --> 1:23:13.093
- I don't know, I don't know.

1:23:13.127 --> 1:23:15.697
I don't know where my dad is.

1:23:15.730 --> 1:23:17.064
- I know, okay.

1:23:17.097 --> 1:23:17.931
- No, you don't know.

1:23:17.965 --> 1:23:19.166
- I do know, I know.

1:23:19.199 --> 1:23:20.367
- No, I don't want
them to take me.

1:23:20.401 --> 1:23:22.504
- Okay, so run then, run!

1:23:22.537 --> 1:23:27.241
Really though, you go and run
and run, but you'll be hungry,

1:23:27.274 --> 1:23:29.943
and I'm not talking about
wanting a sandwich or something.

1:23:29.977 --> 1:23:32.379
'Cause you'll eat, but
you'll still be hungry.

1:23:32.414 --> 1:23:35.617
It don't go away, it
just comes with running.

1:23:35.650 --> 1:23:38.385
And you'll take things from
people because you'll have to,

1:23:38.420 --> 1:23:39.454
and you'll think it's good,

1:23:39.487 --> 1:23:41.388
and you'll think
this is my family.

1:23:41.423 --> 1:23:42.657
But it's a bad trade

1:23:42.690 --> 1:23:46.561
because they want things back
in return, not like a parent.

1:23:46.594 --> 1:23:49.096
Then when you're done
given everything,

1:23:49.129 --> 1:23:52.634
you just wish you could go
back, and fight, and rewind,

1:23:52.667 --> 1:23:54.602
and do anything instead of run.

1:23:57.572 --> 1:23:58.573
- I don't care.

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:04.011
- Yeah, you do, you
care about shit.

1:24:04.044 --> 1:24:05.179
You've been crying.

1:24:08.015 --> 1:24:08.982
- I'm not crying.

1:24:10.350 --> 1:24:15.355
- Cry, like whatever,
just keep caring.

1:24:15.723 --> 1:24:18.992
That's what good people
do, they care about shit.

1:24:19.527 --> 1:24:22.062
And you just run out
here and grab the tower,

1:24:22.095 --> 1:24:24.965
like what do you do, you
kill yourself and then what?

1:24:33.273 --> 1:24:34.274
- Can I try that?

1:24:34.308 --> 1:24:36.243
- No, I said no.

1:24:49.289 --> 1:24:53.160
You know, I think like

1:24:53.761 --> 1:24:57.665
we can only be one thing
at a time, I think.

1:24:59.233 --> 1:25:01.636
Like, you can be a sister,

1:25:02.770 --> 1:25:05.138
I mean, you can't be a sister,

1:25:05.172 --> 1:25:12.179
but be like, a brother,
or dad, work at a bank

1:25:12.212 --> 1:25:17.084
or, do phone sex.

1:25:21.088 --> 1:25:25.125
That's like all we get, is
to be good at that one thing,

1:25:26.193 --> 1:25:27.194
just that one thing.

1:25:30.598 --> 1:25:33.133
- I don't know what my thing is.

1:25:33.166 --> 1:25:36.270
- Me and you, we have to
figure it out way too early.

1:25:37.104 --> 1:25:40.675
Most people don't know
till they're like 30 or 40,

1:25:42.142 --> 1:25:46.414
or like Ray Kroc, he
was like 50 something.

1:25:46.447 --> 1:25:47.849
You know who that is?

1:25:47.882 --> 1:25:48.750
- No.

1:25:54.154 --> 1:25:55.355
- How old you think I am?

1:25:56.356 --> 1:25:57.357
- 25.

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:01.261
- Good.

1:26:03.865 --> 1:26:06.634
- All right, how old
do you think I am?

1:26:06.668 --> 1:26:10.672
- 12, 13, 11?
- 12, what?

1:26:10.705 --> 1:26:13.808
- I don't know, you're
a kid, like stay a kid.

1:26:13.841 --> 1:26:16.678
If there's any kid left
in you, hold on to it.

1:26:22.182 --> 1:26:24.886
Listen like, you don't
have to go with them.

1:26:24.919 --> 1:26:28.856
Like, we can run, and
you're a runaway.

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:34.596
Or I can walk with
you over there.

1:26:36.598 --> 1:26:37.665
- Just one thing?

1:26:40.233 --> 1:26:41.101
- I think so.

1:26:46.541 --> 1:26:48.208
- I have a brother.

1:26:49.611 --> 1:26:50.612
- Okay.

1:27:01.623 --> 1:27:03.190
- What are you doing kid?

1:27:03.223 --> 1:27:04.191
You're not under arrest.

1:27:05.292 --> 1:27:07.695
You are pretty quick though,
I'll give you do that.

1:27:07.729 --> 1:27:10.932
- Hey, where are you taking him?

1:27:10.965 --> 1:27:11.398
- Who are you?

1:27:11.432 --> 1:27:12.366
- I'm his friend.

1:27:12.399 --> 1:27:15.202
- We're gonna ride
with the officer, okay?

1:27:15.235 --> 1:27:16.504
He's gonna bring us
to my office okay.

1:27:16.537 --> 1:27:17.438
- All right.

1:27:17.472 --> 1:27:19.272
- Hey, I said, where
are you taking him?

1:27:19.306 --> 1:27:20.240
- How do you know him?

1:27:20.273 --> 1:27:21.809
- I already said that,
like I'm his friend.

1:27:21.843 --> 1:27:23.678
Like I live here, like
just over there.

1:27:26.213 --> 1:27:27.347
- You okay?

1:27:27.782 --> 1:27:29.383
- Tommy, you call me, okay?

1:27:30.384 --> 1:27:31.251
- Does he have your number,

1:27:31.284 --> 1:27:34.221
or you want me to
write it down for him?

1:27:34.254 --> 1:27:35.288
- He knows my number.

1:28:11.526 --> 1:28:14.796
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!

1:28:28.710 --> 1:28:30.310
- Tommy I'm sorry.

1:28:53.668 --> 1:28:56.303
- Why don't you take a
seat right over there?

1:29:10.952 --> 1:29:12.887
- There's Officer Riden.

1:29:13.521 --> 1:29:14.689
