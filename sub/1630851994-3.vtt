vanish it and it appears
underneath the cup.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.561
Here's variation Teller came up with,
where he takes the ball, placed his hand,

09:21.769 --> 09:25.147
shows underneath the cup,
and it still appears underneath the cup.

09:47.128 --> 09:51.757
And our way of, um,
exploring how this fools people,

09:51.841 --> 09:56.762
is by breaking a few rules of magic
with clear plastic cups.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.434

<i>so that's it. Fool me once, shame on you.</i>

10:01.517 --> 10:04.395
<i>Fool me twice, you can't fool the fool me.</i>

10:04.562 --> 10:06.897
Take the first ball,
pretend to place it in our hand,

10:06.981 --> 10:08.816
I've already snuck it
underneath the first cup.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.819
To the second ball
simultaneously secreted beneath the cup,

10:12.153 --> 10:13.821
we'll place it our hand, and show it.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.198
Take the third and final ball,
pretend to place it in our hand,

10:16.282 --> 10:17.325
pretend to show under the cup.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.577
Replace with the cup
that's secretly secreted, and reveal it.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.579
Now, we're all set for the second half.
Three cups all loaded,

10:21.829 --> 10:24.206
three balls on top,
grab the center ball, placed into the cup.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.250
The two side balls,
we put 'em away, we don't need them,

10:26.334 --> 10:28.252
we have three balls
already loaded inside a cup.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.463
These three balls will be...
And this is not juggling,

10:30.546 --> 10:32.757
this is called misdirection.
While you're looking over here,

10:32.882 --> 10:34.258
Teller switches the final ball under,

10:34.383 --> 10:36.844
one more on either side,
and of course for the finish...

10:37.803 --> 10:41.891
-it's the baseball, Jeff.
-Wow! That was fantastic.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.439

by the good doctors.

Hey, I like... I like this.
This is what I was seeing.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.612
Faces are very interesting
to our visual systems

10:54.695 --> 10:57.698
so we tend to look at faces a lot
and that's exactly what you're doing.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.661
Now, these cups and balls,
it divides attention.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.664
Three cups,
three different spatial positions,

11:04.872 --> 11:09.085
makes it that you have to split
your attention. See, you can't decide

11:09.168 --> 11:11.962
between the three locations of the cups,
there are two faces,

11:12.046 --> 11:14.674
you're driving yourself a bit crazy
just trying to keep track of everything

11:14.757 --> 11:16.425
at once and just switching.
