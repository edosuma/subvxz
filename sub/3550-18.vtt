WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.005
PRESTON BUY THIS FOR ME
IN PARIS.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.279
THAT WOMAN IS A...
(Russian accent) GOLD DIGGER.
 THERE WAS
A SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENT...

00:08.279 --> 00:10.010
YOU PROPOSED?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.283
SHE'S THE ONE.
I KNOW IT.

00:12.283 --> 00:14.785
THE OTHER NIGHT WAS
A MISTAKE.

00:14.785 --> 00:17.188
A SURPRISING MOVE...

00:17.188 --> 00:20.051
MR. LOGAN?
 A DANGEROUS DISCLOSURE...

00:20.051 --> 00:22.793
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE SHE LIVES
WHEN I GET MY $1,000.

00:22.793 --> 00:24.795
A STUNNING DISCOVERY...

00:24.795 --> 00:28.399
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH A PICTURE OF REX?
 HE WAS MY FATHER.

00:28.399 --> 00:30.601
AND A WELCOMING EMBRACE.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.269
(Mary Alice) YOU SHOULD
NEVER TRUST FAMILY PHOTOS.

00:38.269 --> 00:42.273
THEY ARE DESIGNED
TO BE MISLEADING.

00:42.273 --> 00:43.814
A MOTHER'S BRIGHT SMILE

00:43.814 --> 00:48.519
MAY HIDE
A LIFETIME OF DISAPPOINTMENT.

00:48.519 --> 00:54.655
A SON'S SWEET EXPRESSION
COULD CONCEAL BOUNDLESS RAGE.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.487
A DAUGHTER'S SEDATE POSE

00:56.487 --> 01:01.532
MIGHT OBSCURE
YEARS OF UNLADYLIKE BEHAVIOR.

01:01.532 --> 01:05.065
AND AS FOR THAT FATHER
WITH THE AIR OF DIGNITY,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.268
THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE...

01:07.268 --> 01:10.741
HE HAS ANOTHER FAMILY
ELSEWHERE.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.106
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

01:15.106 --> 01:17.108
(Bree) WELL,
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

01:17.108 --> 01:20.211
IT'S A SHOCKING BIT OF NEWS,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

01:20.211 --> 01:22.213
SO YOU'RE MY BROTHER?

01:22.213 --> 01:24.415
HALF-BROTHER, TO BE PRECISE.

01:24.415 --> 01:27.158
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:27.158 --> 01:30.621
ANDREW, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

01:30.621 --> 01:33.624
YOUR FATHER SHOULD HAVE TOLD US
ABOUT THIS YEARS AGO.

01:33.624 --> 01:37.728
BUT PLEASE DON'T BE ANGRY
WITH SAM. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

01:37.728 --> 01:42.603
I'M FINE. I JUST, UH, NEED
TO BE BY MYSELF FOR A WHILE.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.775
OF COURSE. WE UNDERSTAND.

01:44.775 --> 01:48.139
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL HUG YOU LATER.

01:48.139 --> 01:50.811
TAKE YOUR TIME.
 (door opens, closes)

01:50.811 --> 01:54.785
WELL, HE CERTAINLY HANDLED THAT
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

01:54.785 --> 01:57.448
WHEN THE SHOCK WEARS OFF,

01:57.448 --> 02:00.521
I THINK WE'LL END UP
GOOD FRIENDS.
 AND WAIT TILL YOU MEET
DANIELLE.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.793
HER FLIGHT COMES IN TOMORROW,

02:02.793 --> 02:05.796
AND I JUST KNOW THE TWO OF YOU
ARE REALLY GONNA HIT IT OFF.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.358
DON'T YOU AGREE, ORSON?

02:07.358 --> 02:10.601
UH, YES, I'M SURE.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.903
SAM, WOULD YOU MIND
LOCKING UP THE TEST KITCHEN?

02:12.903 --> 02:14.705
HAPPY TO.

02:14.705 --> 02:18.269
AGAIN,
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
 (chuckles)

02:21.872 --> 02:24.715
(exhales deeply)

02:24.715 --> 02:27.178
SO WHEN DID YOU SPEAK
TO DANIELLE?

02:27.178 --> 02:30.521
OH, AN HOUR AGO, AND SHE WAS
JUST AS STUNNED AS ANDREW,

02:30.521 --> 02:33.524
BUT WHEN I SAID I WAS GONNA
HAVE A LITTLE DINNER FOR SAM,

02:33.524 --> 02:35.526
SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO BE HERE.

02:35.526 --> 02:37.528
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY
WASTED NO TIME

02:37.528 --> 02:39.890
WELCOMING SAM TO THE FAMILY.

02:39.890 --> 02:43.834
WHY NOT? THAT SKELETON'S BEEN
KEPT IN THE CLOSET LONG ENOUGH.
 NO, I UNDERSTAND.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.836
AND I AGREE
THAT ANDREW AND DANIELLE

02:45.836 --> 02:48.168
SHOULD TRY
TO MAKE A CONNECTION TO SAM.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.670
HE'S THEIR BLOOD RELATIVE.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.673
I'M JUST NOT SURE
WHY YOU'RE SO EXCITED BY IT.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.245
EXCITED?

02:54.245 --> 02:55.846
I'M ASHAMED.

02:55.846 --> 02:56.947
ASHAMED?

02:56.947 --> 03:00.251
REX KEPT THAT BOY
IN THE SHADOWS FOR YEARS.

03:00.251 --> 03:03.284
I CAN'T LOOK AT SAM WITHOUT
FEELING OVERWHELMING GUILT.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.887
BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEEL GUILTY FOR.
 IT DOESN'T MATTER.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.960
REX IS GONE, AND SOMEONE
NEEDS TO MAKE IT UP TO HIM.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.962
HE IS A VAN DE KAMP,

03:11.962 --> 03:16.227
AND I AM GONNA SEE TO IT
THAT HE IS TREATED LIKE ONE.

03:16.227 --> 03:21.532
YES, BE CAREFUL WHEN LOOKING
AT FAMILY PHOTOS--

03:21.532 --> 03:25.676
LIKE CERTAIN MEMBERS
OF THE FAMILY,

03:25.676 --> 03:41.552
THEY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.694
EVERY YEAR,
OAKRIDGE PRIVATE SCHOOL

03:43.694 --> 03:45.926
HELD A FUND-RAISING DRIVE.

03:45.926 --> 03:51.862
STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO SELL
$3 BARS OF CHOCOLATE.

03:51.862 --> 03:55.336
WHOEVER SOLD THE MOST
WOULD RECEIVE A PRIZE.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.238
OF COURSE, FOR SOMEONE TO WIN,

03:58.238 --> 04:02.813
SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO LOSE.

04:02.813 --> 04:06.677
HEY, M.J., HAVE YOU GONE IN
AND GOTTEN YOUR CANDY YET?

04:06.677 --> 04:08.018
NO.

04:08.018 --> 04:10.020
WELL, YOU BETTER HURRY UP,

04:10.020 --> 04:13.023
'CAUSE I ALREADY SAW SOME KIDS
SELLING CANDY OUTSIDE.

04:13.023 --> 04:15.025
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
 WHY NOT?

04:15.025 --> 04:17.027
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA WIN.

04:17.027 --> 04:20.029
I NEVER WIN ANYTHING.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.762
YOU PROMISED HIM HE'D WIN?

04:21.762 --> 04:25.966
HE WAS ABOUT TO CRY.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

04:25.966 --> 04:29.269
HOW ABOUT, "IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED, TRY, TRY AGAIN"?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.642
HE TRIES ALL THE TIME.
HE NEVER WINS ANYTHING.

04:31.642 --> 04:34.945
HE'S HORRIBLE AT SPORTS.
HE'S LOUSY AT CARD GAMES.

04:34.945 --> 04:37.308
LET US NOT FORGET
HIS HUMILIATION

04:37.308 --> 04:39.510
AT THAT SPELLING BEE.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.982
WHY DID HE THINK "KAYAK"
HAD A "Q" IN IT?

04:41.982 --> 04:46.517
MY POINT IS THAT I WANT HIM
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIMSELF.

04:46.517 --> 04:50.721
EVERY CHILD SHOULD WIN
SOMETHING AT LEAST ONCE.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.863
SEE, YOU WIN EVERYTHING.

04:52.863 --> 04:55.926
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE.

04:55.926 --> 04:58.629
DEAR GOD,
NOT THE JUMP ROPE COMPETITION.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.070
IT WAS SIXTH GRADE,

05:00.070 --> 05:02.433
AND THERE WAS
A JUMP ROPE COMPETITION.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.035
IT WAS DOWN TO ME
AND BARBARA BRISCOE.
 (mouths words)

05:05.035 --> 05:07.538
SHE HAD ASTHMA,
AND IT WAS DANDELION SEASON,

05:07.538 --> 05:11.041
AND HER EYES WERE SWOLLEN,
AND SHE WAS JUMPING BLIND,

05:11.041 --> 05:14.485
UNTIL... HER MOM...

05:14.485 --> 05:16.817
GAVE HER
AN ANTIHISTAMINE SHOT--

05:16.817 --> 05:18.919
WHICH IS
TECHNICALLY A STEROID--

05:18.919 --> 05:22.052
AND SHE WAS JUICED!
 (slaps counter)

05:22.052 --> 05:24.525
(exhales deeply)

05:26.527 --> 05:29.600
SO ARE YOU GONNA
BE SUPPORTIVE OR NOT?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.732
YES, I WILL,

05:31.732 --> 05:33.964
IF YOU PROMISE

05:33.964 --> 05:36.567
TO NEVER TELL THAT STORY
AGAIN.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.974
(giggles)

05:43.974 --> 05:45.576
WAS GOOD?

05:45.576 --> 05:48.649
OH, IF I HAD ANY GOVERNMENT
SECRETS, THEY'D BE YOURS.
 (giggles)

05:48.649 --> 05:49.950
(knock on door)

05:49.950 --> 05:53.724
(Lynette) IRINA? I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO GET THE LAUNDRY.

05:53.724 --> 05:55.526
HOLD ONE SECOND.

05:55.526 --> 05:58.058
I AM YET TO GET DECENT.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.093
COME IN.

06:03.093 --> 06:04.965
THANKS.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.038
HUH. I THOUGHT I MADE THAT BED
THIS MORNING.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.841
UM, I, UM,

06:10.841 --> 06:13.003
TAKE NAP.

06:13.003 --> 06:14.975
FEEL MUCH BETTER.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.011
YEAH.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.613
I'LL BET YOU DO.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.457
WELL...

06:26.457 --> 06:29.389
I WILL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.024
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE!

06:34.024 --> 06:35.726
AW, CRAP.

06:35.726 --> 06:37.728
YOUR FATHER AND I TOLD YOU

06:37.728 --> 06:39.730
NO SLEEPING TOGETHER
IN THIS HOUSE,

06:39.730 --> 06:42.633
AND HERE YOU ARE,
OPENLY DEFYING US.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.636
WELL, NOT OPENLY. WE WERE
HOPING TO GET AWAY WITH IT.
 THAT IS NOT FUNNY.

06:45.636 --> 06:47.978
YOUR 11-YEAR-OLD SISTER
IS IN THE NEXT ROOM.

06:47.978 --> 06:51.842
I DON'T WANT YOU SETTING
THAT KIND OF EXAMPLE.

06:51.842 --> 06:55.686
DUDE, LOOK OUT.
MOM'S BACK FROM THE STORE.

06:57.047 --> 07:00.090
OH. UH, THIS IS
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

07:00.090 --> 07:02.052
I BETTER GET DRESSED.

07:02.052 --> 07:05.856
PRESTON!
PRESTON, GET BACK HERE!

07:07.998 --> 07:10.701
I DON'T WANT
A REPEAT OF THIS, IRINA.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.463
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:12.463 --> 07:16.036
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SPEAK TRUTH?

07:16.036 --> 07:19.510
I MEAN, IF PRESTON WAS
SEEING ANOTHER GIRL,

07:19.510 --> 07:21.942
YOU WOULD NOT MUCH CARE.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.045
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE ME.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.718
THAT... IS NOT TRUE.

07:27.718 --> 07:29.720
I'M STILL
GETTING TO KNOW YOU,

07:29.720 --> 07:31.782
AND I AM SURE
THAT OVER TIME,

07:31.782 --> 07:36.657
I WILL COME TO THINK OF YOU
AS A VALUED MEMBER OF OUR...

07:36.657 --> 07:39.760
OH, HERE'S
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

07:41.231 --> 07:42.933
(both giggling)

07:42.933 --> 07:45.666
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.599
THAT WAS MORE REFRESHING
THAN TAKING A NAP.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.901
MM, I TOLD YOU.

07:50.901 --> 07:53.073
(laughs)

07:53.073 --> 07:54.745
UH, HONEY?

07:54.745 --> 07:55.906
YEAH?

07:55.906 --> 07:57.908
DON'T DRESS
IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.851
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT YOUR BODY
COULD TO DO ROY'S HEART.

08:00.851 --> 08:03.113
WHOOPS. (giggles)

08:03.113 --> 08:05.656
SO, UH, DID YOU EVER
CALL HIM BACK?

08:05.656 --> 08:08.158
YEAH, THIS MORNING.
MRS. McCLUSKEY HAD HER SURGERY,

08:08.158 --> 08:10.120
AND APPARENTLY,
SHE'S CANCER-FREE,

08:10.120 --> 08:12.262
SO ROY'S THROWING A PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.

08:12.262 --> 08:16.026
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET. I HOPE
YOU TOLD HIM WE'LL BE THERE.

08:16.026 --> 08:19.570
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?

08:19.570 --> 08:21.572
I TOLD HIM WE'D GO,

08:21.572 --> 08:24.034
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD GO...

08:24.034 --> 08:25.876
TOGETHER.

08:25.876 --> 08:27.878
HMM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:27.878 --> 08:30.040
WELL, IT'S JUST--
EXCEPT FOR SUSAN,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.582
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH US.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.745
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

08:34.745 --> 08:36.687
NEITHER DO I.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.990
SO... WHAT IS GOING ON
BETWEEN US?

08:39.990 --> 08:42.192
I MEAN,
ARE WE FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?

08:42.192 --> 08:44.995
ARE WE JUST DATING? WHAT?

08:48.158 --> 08:51.101
DO WE HAVE TO PUT A LABEL
ON IT?

08:51.101 --> 08:53.303
NO, I JUST...

08:53.303 --> 08:56.006
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

08:56.006 --> 08:58.108
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

08:58.108 --> 09:00.140
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.743
CAN'T THAT BE ENOUGH
FOR NOW?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.845
IT COULD BE,

09:04.845 --> 09:07.217
BUT IT COULD ALSO
BE PRETTY WONDERFUL

09:07.217 --> 09:10.751
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW HOW HAPPY
WE MAKE EACH OTHER.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.584
I... DON'T KNOW.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.285
HEY.

09:15.285 --> 09:17.988
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE NAP.

09:22.793 --> 09:25.095
(singsong voice) HELLO, LADIES!
HIDE THE BOOZE.

09:25.095 --> 09:27.237
WE HAVE A GUEST.
 (Lynette) HEY, JUANITA.

09:27.237 --> 09:28.999
OKAY, HIT IT.

09:28.999 --> 09:33.203
HI. MY NAME IS JUANITA SOLIS,
AND I'M IN THE THIRD GRADE.

09:33.203 --> 09:35.646
YOU'RE LOSING 'EM.
GET TO THE PITCH.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.147
"WON'T YOU SUPPORT ME?

09:37.147 --> 09:39.579
"I AM SELLING CANDY
SO I CAN STAY IN SCHOOL

09:39.579 --> 09:42.683
AND NOT END UP ON THE STREET
SELLING DRUGS."

09:42.683 --> 09:44.815
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

09:44.815 --> 09:46.957
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
IT'S A FUND-RAISER.

09:46.957 --> 09:49.119
3 BUCKS A BAR.
WHIP OUT YOUR WALLETS.

09:49.119 --> 09:53.363
WELL, I'D HATE TO SEE JUANITA
ON CRACK, SO I'LL BUY ONE.
 ME, TOO. DO YOU HAVE CARAMEL?

09:53.363 --> 09:55.065
ONE LOUSY BAR?

09:55.065 --> 09:57.127
LADIES, IT'S A CONTEST.
JUANITA PLANS TO WIN.

09:57.127 --> 10:00.600
COME ON. NEED I REMIND YOU
OF ALL THE CRAP I'VE BOUGHT

10:00.600 --> 10:03.804
FROM YOUR KIDS OVER THE YEARS?
AND I DO MEAN CRAP,

10:03.804 --> 10:06.807
NOT LIKE THIS QUALITY PROCESSED
SUGAR I AM PEDDLING TODAY.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.980
JUANITA, M.J. IS PLAYING
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.942
WHY DON'T YOU GO JOIN HIM?

10:11.942 --> 10:14.885
HERE'S THE THING--
UM, BEFORE YOU GOT HERE,

10:14.885 --> 10:18.388
BREE AND LYNETTE AGREED
TO BUY EIGHT BARS FROM M.J.

10:18.388 --> 10:21.822
IT'S OKAY.
THEY CAN BUY FROM JUANITA, TOO.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.124
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.628
SEE, UM, M.J. IS HAVING A BIT
OF A SELF-ESTEEM CRISIS LATELY,

10:28.628 --> 10:31.802
AND, UH, HE FEELS LIKE
HE'S ON A LOSING STREAK,

10:31.802 --> 10:35.265
SO I REALLY, REALLY NEED HIM
TO WIN THIS ONE.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.967
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

10:36.967 --> 10:38.669
OF COURSE.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.411
THANK YOU.
 I UNDERSTAND.
I JUST DON'T CARE.

10:41.411 --> 10:43.013
EXCUSE ME?

10:43.013 --> 10:45.115
JUANITA'S HAVING
A CRISIS OF HER OWN.

10:45.115 --> 10:46.416
SHE'S NEW TO OAKRIDGE,

10:46.416 --> 10:49.950
AND SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE
MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.952
AS YOU KNOW,
THE WINNER GETS A BIG PARTY,

10:51.952 --> 10:53.954
AND THEY CAN INVITE
WHOEVER THEY WANT,

10:53.954 --> 10:57.688
WHICH COULD GO A LONG WAY
IN HELPING HER FIT IN.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.189
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

10:59.189 --> 11:00.791
SURE. OF COURSE.

11:03.233 --> 11:06.737
IT'S JUST, HE'S NEVER WON
ANYTHING BEFORE.

11:06.737 --> 11:08.438
SHE HAS NO FRIENDS.

11:11.842 --> 11:14.845
SO... WHAT ARE WE DOING?
(chuckles)

11:14.845 --> 11:17.708
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME
IF WE BUY THE SAME AMOUNT

11:17.708 --> 11:20.711
FROM BOTH OF YOU,
IT'LL JUST BE A WASH, RIGHT?

11:20.711 --> 11:24.785
SO REALLY, WE DON'T NEED
TO BUY ANY AT ALL.

11:26.356 --> 11:29.189
GET OUT YOUR WALLET.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.069
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

11:39.069 --> 11:41.932
I WAS SO SHOCKED TO HEAR
YOU HAD LUNG CANCER.

11:41.932 --> 11:43.934
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU SMOKED.

11:43.934 --> 11:45.936
I DIDN'T.
THAT'S THE THING.

11:45.936 --> 11:48.708
PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE TO BE
A SMOKER TO GET IT,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.881
BUT YOU DON'T.
A GIRL YOUR AGE WAS

11:50.881 --> 11:53.884
HAVING THE SAME SURGERY I HAD,
NEVER SMOKED A DAY IN HER LIFE.

11:53.884 --> 11:57.187
YOU COULD BE THAT GIRL,
GABY.

11:57.187 --> 11:59.289
LET'S GET A DRINK,

11:59.289 --> 12:02.192
YOU KNOW,
SINCE WE'RE DYING ANYWAY.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.056
(lowered voice) NOW REMEMBER,
WE'RE NOT A COUPLE.

12:06.056 --> 12:09.429
(lowered voice) I KNOW. WE'RE ON
A COVERT LESBIAN MISSION.
 I'M SORRY.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.432
I JUST WANT PEOPLE NOT
TO FIGURE OUT WE'RE TOGETHER.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.134
IT'LL BLOW THEIR MINDS.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.436
OH, PLEASE. YOU STABBED YOURSELF
AND BLAMED MIKE,

12:16.436 --> 12:19.239
AND THIS
 WILL BLOW THEIR MINDS?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.240
HEY, LADIES.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.972
HI, TOM. HAVING FUN?

12:21.972 --> 12:24.114
BEST CANCER PARTY EVER.
(chuckles)

12:24.114 --> 12:27.818
(laughs)
 LISTEN, UM, I WAS TALKING
TO KAREN'S DOCTOR.

12:27.818 --> 12:30.951
UH, YOU MADE
QUITE THE IMPRESSION ON HIM.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.854
ME?
 YEAH. HE BEGGED ME
TO INTRODUCE YOU.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.155
D-D-DO YOU MIND?

12:35.155 --> 12:36.987
WHY WOULD I?

12:36.987 --> 12:39.059
WE'RE ONLY ROOMMATES.

12:41.091 --> 12:43.233
AND HERE'S YOUR CHANGE.
ENJOY.
 (mouths word)

12:43.233 --> 12:44.795
(Gabrielle) HEY!

12:44.795 --> 12:46.366
WILLY WONKA!

12:46.366 --> 12:49.199
SELLING CANDY
AT AN "I SURVIVED CANCER" PARTY?

12:49.199 --> 12:50.300
TACKY.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.173
CHOCOLATE IS FILLED
WITH ANTIOXIDANTS,

12:53.173 --> 12:56.076
WHICH, AS WE ALL KNOW,
FIGHT DISEASE.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.149
SO YOU COULD SAY
THAT I JUST SAVED A LIFE.

12:59.149 --> 13:01.251
YEAH, RIGHT. THE COMPETITION
IS BETWEEN THE KIDS.

13:01.251 --> 13:04.784
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING
THE SELLING, NOT THE PARENTS.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
GABY, SPEEDO SEASON IS
A MONTH AWAY,

13:06.786 --> 13:10.190
AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO SELL THIS TO MY HUSBAND?

13:16.266 --> 13:18.999
(man) ...HE WAS A DOCTOR.
SHE WAS A SURGEON.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.901
OH. (laughs)
 YEAH.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.003
I ALWAYS KNEW
I'D GO TO MED SCHOOL,

13:23.003 --> 13:25.135
YOU KNOW, THAT INCREDIBLE
FEELING OF HELPING PEOPLE.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.137
PLUS, THEY GIVE YOU
THAT LITTLE PAD,

13:27.137 --> 13:30.080
AND YOU CAN WRITE
ANY PRESCRIPTION YOU WANT.
 (laughs)

13:30.080 --> 13:32.082
BEAUTIFUL
AND LAUGHS AT MY JOKES.

13:32.082 --> 13:34.214
TWO MORE COCKTAILS,
AND I MAY BE PROPOSING.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.887
(laughs)
 HI. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

13:36.887 --> 13:40.851
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?
 WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, DAVID?

13:40.851 --> 13:44.254
...AND SHE NEVER SMOKED
A DAY IN HER LIFE.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.957
YOU COULD BE THAT GIRL,
LEE.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.261
LOOK, IT'S ONE THING
TO HIDE OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:51.261 --> 13:55.035
IT'S ANOTHER TO FLIRT WITH A MAN
RIGHT IN MY FACE.
 I WASN'T FLIRTING.
HE WAS FLIRTING WITH ME.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.466
I SAW YOUR FACE.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.939
YOU WERE ENJOYING IT.
 OKAY.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.270
HEY, LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.312
I-I JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING

14:02.312 --> 14:06.316
AND TO SAY TO KAREN, THANK GOD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, BABY.
 AH.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.048
(all cheer)

14:08.048 --> 14:09.419
THANKS, EVERYBODY.

14:09.419 --> 14:12.422
AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK
THE BIG GUY UPSTAIRS.

14:12.422 --> 14:15.125
NOW IF WE COULD ALL
TAKE A MOMENT

14:15.125 --> 14:18.458
TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE
WHO WEREN'T AS LUCKY AS I WAS.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.632
MAKE UP YOUR MIND, KATHERINE.
ARE YOU GAY OR STRAIGHT?

14:22.632 --> 14:25.635
I DON'T KNOW! JUST BECAUSE
I ENJOY HAVING SEX WITH YOU

14:25.635 --> 14:28.338
DOESN'T MAKE ME A LESBIAN!

14:28.338 --> 14:31.271
(crickets chirping)

14:33.273 --> 14:35.245
LOOK AT THIS.

14:35.245 --> 14:39.179
I WONDER WHAT REX WOULD SAY
IF HE SAW US HERE ALL TOGETHER.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.982
PROBABLY "WHO'S THE GUY
IN THE WHEELCHAIR?"

14:41.982 --> 14:46.156
SO, SAM, MOM TELLS ME
YOU GOT SOME FANCY DEGREE?

14:46.156 --> 14:49.019
HIS M.B.A., WHICH HE EARNED
WHILE WORKING TWO JOBS

14:49.019 --> 14:52.022
AND NURSING HIS SICK MOTHER.
 I JUST DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

14:52.022 --> 14:55.425
DON'T BE SO MODEST. HE ALSO
SPENT A SUMMER IN MICRONESIA,

14:55.425 --> 14:57.427
HELPING TO DIG WELLS.

14:57.427 --> 15:02.102
IT WAS CHALLENGING, BUT I REALLY
WANTED TO WORK WITH THE POOR.
 SOUNDS LIKE MY FIRST JOB.

15:02.102 --> 15:06.206
YOU WORKED IN THE FOOD COURT
AT THE MALL.
 THE OUTLET MALL. (scoffs)

15:06.206 --> 15:09.209
TRUST ME. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WORK WITH POOR PEOPLE.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.941
THEY'RE ALWAYS LATE.

15:10.941 --> 15:13.613
REX AND I ALWAYS HOPED
THE CHILDREN WOULD TAKE

15:13.613 --> 15:16.416
AN INTEREST IN WORKING WITH
THOSE LESS FORTUNATE, BUT--

15:16.416 --> 15:19.049
WE SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DISAPPOINT THEM ONCE AGAIN,

15:19.049 --> 15:20.350
AND WE GRABBED IT.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.594
SO... (clears throat)

15:24.594 --> 15:27.127
MY FATHER WAS INTERESTED
IN CHARITY WORK.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.299
WHAT ELSE?
 OH, SO MANY THINGS--

15:29.299 --> 15:31.701
TRAVEL, HISTORY, THE ARTS.

15:31.701 --> 15:34.164
OH, HE ESPECIALLY
LOVED MUSIC.

15:34.164 --> 15:35.966
REALLY? ME, TOO.

15:35.966 --> 15:37.267
I PLAY THE GUITAR.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.170
YOU DO? STAY RIGHT THERE.

15:42.212 --> 15:45.215
(playing mid-tempo song)

15:58.028 --> 16:00.390
(song ends)

16:00.390 --> 16:02.292
THAT WAS LOVELY.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.195
I'M REALLY RUSTY.
 YEAH, I COULD HEAR THAT.

16:05.195 --> 16:07.297
THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

16:07.297 --> 16:09.599
I'M ACTUALLY PLAYING
MY DAD'S GUITAR.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.971
IT'S JUST BEEN SITTING
IN THAT CLOSET FOR YEARS,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.173
GATHERING DUST.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.175
IN FACT,
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP IT?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.207
WHAT?
 WHAT?

16:17.207 --> 16:19.309
WHY NOT?
YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING

16:19.309 --> 16:22.682
TO REMEMBER YOUR FATHER BY.
 WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT IF I WANT IT?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.185
WHAT IF DANIELLE WANTS IT?

16:25.185 --> 16:28.058
I DON'T WANT IT.
 DON'T YOU HAVE
A FLIGHT TO CATCH?

16:28.058 --> 16:30.460
ANDREW, YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN
ANY INTEREST IN THAT THING.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.763
IT'S MY DAD'S GUITAR.
I'M PLENTY INTERESTED.
 BUT YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY.

16:33.763 --> 16:36.196
I DO SO.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.528
I TOOK LESSONS, OKAY?

16:38.528 --> 16:41.000
WELL, BY ALL MEANS...

16:42.432 --> 16:44.704
WE'D LOVE TO HEAR.

16:49.439 --> 16:52.682
(strumming dissonant chords)
 (off-key) ♪ JINGLE BELLS ♪

16:52.682 --> 16:54.484
♪ JINGLE BELL-- ♪

16:54.484 --> 16:56.015
♪ JINGLE ♪

16:56.015 --> 16:59.189
♪ ALL THE... ♪

16:59.189 --> 17:01.491
♪ WAY ♪

17:01.491 --> 17:03.693
♪ OH, WHAT FUN ♪

17:03.693 --> 17:07.396
WHAT FUN INDEED. NOW WOULD YOU
PLEASE GIVE SAM THE GUITAR?

17:07.396 --> 17:09.329
NO.

17:09.329 --> 17:13.233
IF ANDREW WANTS IT
THAT BADLY--
 HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE GUITAR.

17:13.233 --> 17:17.406
HE'S JUST BEING UNREASONABLE.
 YOU'RE GIVING OUT MY DAD'S STUFF
TO A TOTAL STRANGER,

17:17.406 --> 17:19.108
AND I-I'M UNREASONABLE?

17:19.108 --> 17:22.112
SAM IS A MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY.
NOW GIVE HIM THE GUITAR.

17:22.112 --> 17:26.045
HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE SPLIT IT?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.518
(gasps)

17:28.518 --> 17:31.351
(guitar clatters)

17:31.351 --> 17:33.383
(Bree sighs)

17:40.390 --> 17:42.332
I MUST APOLOGIZE.

17:42.332 --> 17:45.165
MY PRESENCE HERE IS CLEARLY
CAUSING UNHAPPINESS.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.238
I THINK I SHOULD GO.
 NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

17:48.238 --> 17:50.240
YOU HAVE BEHAVED
WITH THE UTMOST DIGNITY

17:50.240 --> 17:52.672
IN THE FACE
OF UNTHINKABLE RUDENESS.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.344
THANK YOU.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.708
YEAH, I KNOW.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.850
HE'S THE PERFECT SON.

18:00.850 --> 18:03.513
(scoffs) PROBLEM IS,
HE'S NOT YOURS.

18:03.513 --> 18:06.516
(sighs)

18:16.766 --> 18:18.528
(sighs)

18:18.528 --> 18:21.231
SO... WE TALKING YET?

18:24.574 --> 18:27.177
(sighs)

18:30.210 --> 18:32.582
JEEZ, ANGE! WHAT THE HELL?

18:32.582 --> 18:34.584
I'M GETTING BORED
OF THE SILENT TREATMENT,

18:34.584 --> 18:37.517
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SHOOT ME.
 (sighs)

18:41.221 --> 18:44.624
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL HER.
 I KNOW MY MOM, NICK.
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY

18:44.624 --> 18:48.298
SHE WAS LETTING GO OF DANNY.
SO ARE WE OVER THIS?

18:48.298 --> 18:52.432
BECAUSE IF NOT, I WOULD REALLY
PREFER A BULLET IN MY HEAD.
 IT USED TO BE JUST YOU,
ME AND PATRICK KNEW.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.704
NOW YOUR MOM.
WHAT IF HE FINDS OUT?

18:54.704 --> 18:58.908
SHE IS NOT GONNA TELL HIM.
 ANGE, I LOVE THAT BOY.

18:58.908 --> 19:01.371
I WAS THE ONE
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

19:01.371 --> 19:04.574
I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO HOLD HIM,
EVEN BEFORE YOU.

19:04.574 --> 19:07.577
I KNOW.
 I CANNOT LET HIM FIND OUT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.719
I HAVE GOT TO TELL HIM.

19:09.719 --> 19:11.721
NO. YOU ARE HIS FATHER.

19:11.721 --> 19:14.324
YOU GAVE UP YOUR LIFE
TO PROTECT HIM.

19:14.324 --> 19:16.886
YOU'RE THE ONLY FATHER
HE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT.

19:22.692 --> 19:25.295
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S...

19:27.297 --> 19:29.839
NOW PLEASE GET THIS
THE HELL OUT OF HERE, HUH,

19:29.839 --> 19:31.671
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT?

19:31.671 --> 19:35.245
(clicks)

19:35.245 --> 19:38.608
I MEAN, I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D
DO IT, BUT I'M NOT STUPID.

19:38.608 --> 19:39.949
(chuckles)

19:42.252 --> 19:44.514
(rings)

19:44.514 --> 19:45.855
HELLO?

19:45.855 --> 19:48.418
(man) It's Patrick Logan.
Just got into town.

19:48.418 --> 19:52.222
I WAS HOPING TO DROP BY,
YOU KNOW, FOR THE INFORMATION?

19:52.222 --> 19:54.524
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

19:54.524 --> 19:56.466
SEE YOU THEN.

19:56.466 --> 20:00.330
OH, AND I'VE GOT A CASE
OF SELECTIVE ALZHEIMER'S,

20:00.330 --> 20:02.532
SO DON'T FORGET THE CASH.

20:05.775 --> 20:07.837
HEY, TINA.

20:07.837 --> 20:09.339
IT'S SUSAN BREMER.

20:09.339 --> 20:13.212
I KNOW. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
NOT SINCE GRADUATION.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.414
SO, LISTEN,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.417
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NIGHT
THAT YOU GOT CAUGHT STREAKING,

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
AND I HAD TO BAIL YOU
OUT OF JAIL,

20:19.419 --> 20:21.391
AND YOU SAID YOU OWED ME ONE?

20:21.391 --> 20:24.954
WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE.
(laughs)

20:24.954 --> 20:26.726
IS THAT MRS. SOLIS?

20:28.898 --> 20:30.900
(Gabrielle
speaking indistinctly)

20:30.900 --> 20:33.403
(men speaking indistinctly)

20:33.403 --> 20:35.365
TINA, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CALL YOU BACK.

20:35.365 --> 20:36.936
OH, MY GOD.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.709
(men continue
speaking indistinctly)

20:39.709 --> 20:42.241
IS SHE SELLING CANDY?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.973
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

20:43.973 --> 20:47.246
I'M GONNA LOSE THIS CONTEST,
AREN'T I?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.419
NO. YOU'RE GONNA WIN,

20:49.419 --> 20:51.481
'CAUSE MOMMY'S
DONE PLAYING FAIR.

20:53.283 --> 20:55.825
HEY.

20:55.825 --> 20:58.428
UH, IRINA AND I
WERE TALKING,

20:58.428 --> 21:01.431
AND WE FEEL REALLY BAD
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

21:01.431 --> 21:04.434
LOOK, UH, WE DON'T WANNA
COME DOWN TOO HARD ON YOU GUYS.

21:04.434 --> 21:06.265
WE'RE JUST NOT COMFORTABLE

21:06.265 --> 21:09.539
HAVING A COUPLE
OF UNMARRIED KIDS

21:09.539 --> 21:11.941
SLEEPING TOGETHER IN OUR HOUSE.
YOU UNDERSTAND.

21:11.941 --> 21:16.576
OH, YES. THAT IS WHY PRESTON
MUST TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW.

21:16.576 --> 21:20.310
IRINA AND I HAVE DECIDED
TO GET OUR OWN APARTMENT.

21:20.310 --> 21:24.314
WHAT?
 THAT WAY IT'LL BE OUR PLACE,
AND WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

21:24.314 --> 21:28.358
NO. NO, NO, NO.
 WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN SIX MONTHS ANYWAY. WHY NOT?

21:28.358 --> 21:30.360
(laughs) WHY NOT?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.792
LYNETTE,
YOU WANNA TAKE THIS ONE?

21:32.792 --> 21:37.026
I THINK
IT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA.

21:37.026 --> 21:39.729
THEY'RE NOT KIDS ANYMORE.

21:39.729 --> 21:42.301
THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.005
THANK YOU, LYNETTE. IT'S GOOD
TO KNOW WE HAVE YOUR SUPPORT.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.507
(chuckles)

21:47.507 --> 21:49.509
(Preston) SEE YOU LATER.
 (Lynette) OKAY.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.512
(giggles)
 HAVE FUN.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.945
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE--WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO PULL 'EM APART,

21:55.945 --> 21:57.617
NOT PUSH 'EM TOGETHER.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.949
DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT APARTMENT WE MOVED INTO

21:59.949 --> 22:02.422
WHEN WE WERE SAVING
FOR THIS HOUSE?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.754
THAT DUMP? YEAH.
IT WAS THE SIZE OF A CLOSET.

22:04.754 --> 22:07.857
UH-HUH. YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE TREATED EACH OTHER?

22:07.857 --> 22:10.660
I REMEMBER A LOT OF YELLING
AND THROWING STUFF.

22:10.660 --> 22:14.063
GOD, THERE WERE A FEW TIMES I
WAS AFRAID THAT WE WERE GONNA...

22:14.063 --> 22:16.436
BREAK UP?

22:18.738 --> 22:20.770
LYNETTE?
 MM-HMM.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.772
YOU ARE DEVIOUS AND EVIL,

22:22.772 --> 22:26.616
AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN
MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU!

22:26.616 --> 22:28.648
MM. (laughs)
 (chuckles)

22:28.648 --> 22:32.351
SUSAN DELFINO,
YOU ARE SO BUSTED!

22:32.351 --> 22:34.384
GABY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:34.384 --> 22:36.826
ALICE GIBSON TOLD ME
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO,

22:36.826 --> 22:40.730
BUT I COULDN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD SINK SO LOW.
 I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.862
OKAY, FOLKS.
UH, WE'RE ON A BREAK.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.864
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TAKE
THEIR MEDS.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.936
NO, NOT YET! NOT YET!

22:46.936 --> 22:48.968
WILL YOU STOP AT NOTHING
TO WIN THIS COMPETITION?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.100
OH, THAT'S FUNNY,
COMING FROM YOU.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.072
ME? I HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.074
WELL,
LET ME JOG YOUR MEMORY--

22:55.074 --> 22:57.607
CONSTRUCTION SITE,
COLD WIND, NO BRA.

22:57.607 --> 22:59.809
OH, YOU SAW THAT.

22:59.809 --> 23:04.013
OH, YEAH. DID I NOT TELL YOU
HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS TO M.J.?

23:04.013 --> 23:06.015
YES, AND I TOLD YOU
ABOUT JUANITA.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.488
BUT APPARENTLY, YOUR SON'S
PROBLEMS ARE MORE IMPORTANT

23:08.488 --> 23:11.390
THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.
 THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.392
WHATEVER.
WE ARE DONE HERE.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.165
OOH. AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I AM TAKING THE GLOVES OFF.

23:16.165 --> 23:18.968
WELL, WHY NOT? YOU'VE
TAKEN OFF EVERYTHING ELSE.

23:18.968 --> 23:21.030
CANDY FOR SALE!

23:21.030 --> 23:24.133
HELP A YOUNG BOY
WALK AGAIN.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.143
(dog barking in distance)

23:34.143 --> 23:36.816
(Karen) HI, KATHERINE.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.118
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE THE PARTY. HOW YOU DOING?

23:39.118 --> 23:41.551
STILL HUMILIATED.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

23:41.551 --> 23:44.454
OH, COME ON.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

23:46.425 --> 23:50.730
MY SEX LIFE WAS LAID BARE
FOR THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.131
WHAT COULD BE WORSE?

23:52.131 --> 23:54.764
LET'S SEE.
YOU COULD HAVE THROWN A PARTY

23:54.764 --> 23:56.766
TO CELEBRATE
GETTING OVER CANCER

23:56.766 --> 23:59.509
AND HAD A COUPLE OF LESBIANS
STEAL YOUR THUNDER.

23:59.509 --> 24:01.170
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.942
BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY,

24:02.942 --> 24:05.545
KNOWING EVERYONE IS
OUT THERE JUDGING ME.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.618
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHIN'.

24:08.618 --> 24:10.750
DO YOU REALLY LIKE
THIS GIRL?

24:10.750 --> 24:14.083
I DON'T KNOW.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.625
(sighs)

24:15.625 --> 24:17.456
I THINK I MIGHT.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.490
THEN WHY DO YOU GIVE A DAMN
WHAT ANYONE ELSE THINKS?

24:20.490 --> 24:23.593
PEOPLE JUST STOPPED SEEING ME
AS THE CRAZY LADY ON THE STREET.

24:23.593 --> 24:26.065
I'M NOT READY FOR THEM
TO START SEEING ME

24:26.065 --> 24:28.237
AS THE MIDDLE-AGED LESBIAN,
OKAY?

24:28.237 --> 24:31.240
WELL, IF YOU CARE THAT MUCH
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK,

24:31.240 --> 24:32.942
YOU'VE GOT TWO CHOICES--

24:32.942 --> 24:36.145
DUMP THE GIRL OR MOVE SOMEPLACE
WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GOSSIP,

24:36.145 --> 24:39.178
IF SUCH A PLACE EXISTS.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.180
IT'S NOT MUCH OF A CHOICE.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.514
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.058
OH. I GET IT.

24:49.058 --> 24:50.690
THANK YOU.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.693
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
BREAK IT UP.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.896
THIS IS HOW RUMORS
GET STARTED.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.829
(laughs)

25:01.731 --> 25:03.973
MMM! WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?

25:03.973 --> 25:05.274
THAT'S BORSCHT.
 BORSCHT!

25:05.274 --> 25:07.136
IRINA IS MAKING DINNER.

25:07.136 --> 25:10.209
(Tom laughs)
 YOU KIDS HAVE BEEN SO BUSY
LOOKING FOR YOUR APARTMENT,

25:10.209 --> 25:14.013
WE'VE HARDLY SEEN YOU
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
 YEAH. YOU FIND
SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.946
PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT
ON A PLACE YESTERDAY.

25:16.946 --> 25:19.088
WELL, HA HA!

25:19.088 --> 25:21.090
DON'T BE FREAKED OUT
ABOUT THE SIZE.

25:21.090 --> 25:24.093
YOU TWO WILL HAVE
SO MUCH FUN...
 OH.

25:24.093 --> 25:26.996
THAT YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
HOW SMALL IT IS.

25:26.996 --> 25:30.199
IT'S NOT SMALL.
THREE BEDROOMS AND A BALCONY.

25:30.199 --> 25:32.301
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO AFFORD
A 3-BEDROOM APARTMENT

25:32.301 --> 25:34.303
WHILE YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE?

25:34.303 --> 25:37.567
YOU TELL THEM.
I SERVE BORSCHT.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.909
TELL US WHAT?

25:39.909 --> 25:41.210
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:41.210 --> 25:43.212
WE CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING NICE
ON OUR BUDGET,

25:43.212 --> 25:46.616
SO I'M GONNA PUT OFF COLLEGE
AND GET A JOB.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.680
SAY... SOMETHING!

25:50.680 --> 25:53.683
(sputters) ARE YOU SURE YOU
THOUGHT THIS THING THROUGH?

25:53.683 --> 25:56.686
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION

25:56.686 --> 25:59.258
TO GET A GOOD JOB.
 I ALREADY GOT A GOOD JOB.

25:59.258 --> 26:03.132
YOU DID? WHERE?
 THE MEATPACKING PLANT.
I'M A GUTTER.

26:03.132 --> 26:05.164
A GUTTER?

26:05.164 --> 26:08.898
WELL, I'M THE GUY
WHO SCOOPS OUT ALL THE--
 YEAH, YEAH! I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

26:08.898 --> 26:12.201
WELL, DID YOU KNOW I GET PAID
14 BUCKS AN HOUR,

26:12.201 --> 26:15.204
PLUS BENEFITS?
 SERIOUSLY? WHAT,
IS IT A UNION JOB?

26:15.204 --> 26:17.747
THOSE JOBS ARE HARD TO GET.
HUH.

26:17.747 --> 26:21.010
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET A DISCOUNT
ON STEAKS, TOO.
 YOUR SON JUST ANNOUNCED
THAT HE'S GIVING UP COLLEGE

26:21.010 --> 26:23.813
SO HE CAN BE
THE GUY IN CHARGE OF GUTS,

26:23.813 --> 26:27.186
AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS,
"OH, BOY. FREE MEAT"?

26:27.186 --> 26:30.089
THIS IS GOOD JOB. THE MONEY
IS A LOT. WHAT IS PROBLEM?

26:30.089 --> 26:34.163
MAYBE IN RUSSIA,
IT'S EVERY MOTHER'S DREAM

26:34.163 --> 26:37.166
FOR HER SON TO SEE WHAT
THE INSIDE OF A COW LOOKS LIKE,

26:37.166 --> 26:39.168
BUT NOT IN MY HOME!
 LYNETTE, CALM DOWN.

26:39.168 --> 26:42.201
YOU COULD BE A DOCTOR!
YOU COULD BE A LAWYER!

26:42.201 --> 26:45.935
WHY ARE YOU SO INTENT
ON THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY?
 MOM--

26:45.935 --> 26:48.237
HE IS GOING TO SUPPORT
HIS WIFE.

26:48.237 --> 26:50.740
THAT IS WHAT MEN DO
FOR WOMEN THEY LOVE.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.182
HE'S NOT IN LOVE!

26:53.182 --> 26:57.086
HE'S BLINDED BY A PIECE
OF SELF-SERVING EURO TRASH

26:57.086 --> 27:01.290
WHO WOULD SELL HER OWN MOTHER
FOR A PAIR OF DESIGNER JEANS!

27:01.290 --> 27:02.792
AAH!

27:04.994 --> 27:06.996
(sighs)

27:17.707 --> 27:19.208
(bottles clink)

27:23.743 --> 27:25.214
HEY.

27:25.214 --> 27:26.746
THANKS.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.648
WHAT'S WITH THE BIKE?
 EDDIE THINKS HE CAN GET ME

27:29.648 --> 27:31.650
A COUPLE OF SHIFTS
DOWN AT THE COFFEE SHOP.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.054
AND SINCE YOU GUYS ARE TOO CHEAP
TO BUY ME A CAR...
 (air hisses)

27:35.054 --> 27:36.385
YOUR FIRST JOB.

27:36.385 --> 27:39.058
(clink)
 HEY, LOOK AT YOU.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.290
MM. (chuckles) MM-HMM.
 (sets bottle down)

27:41.290 --> 27:43.292
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY LITTLE BOY?

27:43.292 --> 27:46.195
(clears throat) I GREW UP.
THAT'S KINDA THE WAY IT WORKS.

27:46.195 --> 27:48.838
NO, I KNOW. I KNOW.
IT'S JUST...

27:48.838 --> 27:50.770
GOD.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.773
YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GONNA GO
AS FAST AS IT DOES.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.275
YOU--YOU'RE SO BUSY
JUST GETTING THROUGH THE DAY.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.277
YOU DON'T REALIZE
THEY'RE, UH,

27:58.277 --> 28:00.449
STARTING TO ADD UP.

28:02.812 --> 28:04.313
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:04.313 --> 28:07.056
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 MM, YOU GOT THAT LOOK

28:07.056 --> 28:09.919
THAT SAYS... (imitates Nick)
"I GOT SOMETHIN' TO TELL YOU,

28:09.919 --> 28:13.292
AND IT AIN'T GON' BE PRETTY."
 (laughs) YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW ME, RIGHT?

28:13.292 --> 28:16.325
(normal voice) OF COURSE I DO.
YOU'RE MY DAD.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.403
SO WHAT'S UP?

28:27.406 --> 28:30.209
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM YOUR DAD.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.711
HUH?

28:34.744 --> 28:37.216
NO. FORGET ABOUT IT.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.448
WORK ON YOUR BIKE.

28:39.448 --> 28:41.390
HEY.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.925
CONGRATS ON THE JOB.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.730
(door closes)

28:51.730 --> 28:53.232
(knock on door)

28:53.232 --> 28:54.934
WHO IS IT?

28:54.934 --> 28:57.266
(man) PATRICK LOGAN.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.273
HOPE YOU LIKE ROSES.

29:07.316 --> 29:09.979
(siren wailing in distance)

29:09.979 --> 29:13.382
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T GET
AN ADDRESS OR ANYTHING.

29:13.382 --> 29:16.125
YOU GOT ME
EVERYTHING I NEEDED.
 GOOD.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.126
(chuckles)

29:17.126 --> 29:21.060
SO... THEN I GUESS...

29:21.060 --> 29:23.292
AH.

29:23.292 --> 29:25.034
OF COURSE.

29:32.441 --> 29:34.273
I KNOW YOU...

29:34.273 --> 29:36.775
BEEN LOOKING FOR ANGIE
FOR A LONG TIME,

29:36.775 --> 29:39.879
BUT, UH, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
ANY TROUBLE, RIGHT?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.881
TROUBLE?

29:41.881 --> 29:44.483
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA, LIKE,
HURT HER OR ANYTHING?

29:44.483 --> 29:48.017
SHE TOOK SOMETHING OF MINE.
I WANT IT BACK.

29:48.017 --> 29:51.260
OKAY.

29:51.260 --> 29:53.893
I-IT'S JUST--I LIKE ROSE,

29:53.893 --> 29:55.895
AND I DON'T EVER WANT
TO HEAR

29:55.895 --> 29:58.367
THAT SOMETHING BAD'S
HAPPENED TO HER KID.

30:01.370 --> 30:04.103
YOU SHOULD GET THAT MONEY
TO THE BANK.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.235
THIS PLACE DOESN'T SEEM
VERY SAFE TO ME.

30:06.235 --> 30:09.338
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LOOK AT ALL THOSE LOCKS.

30:09.338 --> 30:11.340
YEAH.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.343
BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE WERE
TO COME UP THIS FIRE ESCAPE?

30:14.343 --> 30:17.246
OH, THAT WINDOW'S
ALWAYS LOCKED.

30:17.246 --> 30:20.289
YOU THINK
THAT'S GONNA STOP THEM?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.558
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

30:29.558 --> 30:31.861
THEN THEY REACH THROUGH,

30:31.861 --> 30:34.333
UNLOCK THE WINDOW...

30:35.905 --> 30:40.269
AND NOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

30:50.419 --> 30:53.222
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU?

30:53.222 --> 30:56.385
HOW WILL THIS CONVERSATION END?
WITH BEEF STROGANOFF ON MY HEAD?

30:56.385 --> 30:58.257
I AM SORRY.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.959
PLEASE TO FORGIVE.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.561
I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.133
REALLY?

31:04.133 --> 31:06.295
THINK HOW HARD IT IS
FOR PRESTON,

31:06.295 --> 31:09.268
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
BETWEEN OUR FIGHTING,

31:09.268 --> 31:12.071
WHEN HE WANTS US
TO LOVE EACH OTHER ONLY.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.442
YES?

31:13.442 --> 31:16.105
I DON'T WANT TO PUT PRESTON
IN THE MIDDLE,

31:16.105 --> 31:18.107
BUT I AM HIS MOTHER,

31:18.107 --> 31:23.252
AND I WILL FIGHT FOR HIS BEST
INTERESTS TILL THE DAY I DIE.
 YOU MEAN YOU WILL FIGHT ME.

31:23.252 --> 31:26.415
YEAH. YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH
JUST FINE.

31:26.415 --> 31:29.418
NOW YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

31:29.418 --> 31:34.193
I TOLD PRESTON I WANT TO MOVE UP
WEDDING TO NEXT WEEK,

31:34.193 --> 31:35.965
AND HE SAID YES.

31:35.965 --> 31:39.668
NEXT WEEK? THE WEDDING IS NOT
FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.670
WE CANNOT WAIT THAT LONG.

31:41.670 --> 31:43.672
IT IS TOO HARD
FOR PRESTON TO CHOOSE

31:43.672 --> 31:45.975
BETWEEN A MOTHER
AND A GIRLFRIEND,

31:45.975 --> 31:49.939
SO ONCE I AM HIS WIFE,
CHOICE WILL BE MUCH EASIER.

31:49.939 --> 31:52.441
NO. NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

31:52.441 --> 31:54.443
YOU MET
EACH OTHER SIX WEEKS AGO.

31:54.443 --> 31:56.445
PRESTON BARELY KNOWS YOU.

31:56.445 --> 31:58.347
BUT YOU DO, YES?

31:58.347 --> 32:00.649
YOU THINK YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT ME,

32:00.649 --> 32:04.453
AND IN MUCH LESS TIME
THAN THAT.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.397
THERE.

32:08.397 --> 32:12.031
FROM ONE MRS. SCAVO
TO ANOTHER.

32:15.264 --> 32:18.937
I FOUND SOME OF YOUR FATHER'S
OLD YEARBOOKS UP IN THE ATTIC.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.370
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY
LOOKING AT THEM.

32:21.370 --> 32:24.273
HE PLAYED FOOTBALL?

32:24.273 --> 32:27.716
YES, AND HE WAS
STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT.

32:27.716 --> 32:30.419
SO WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM?

32:30.419 --> 32:32.951
EVEN MY MOM DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW HIM THAT WELL.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.954
HE WAS, UM,

32:35.954 --> 32:38.427
INCREDIBLY SMART,

32:38.427 --> 32:40.189
FUNNY...

32:41.690 --> 32:44.533
AND SO GRACEFUL.

32:47.496 --> 32:49.238
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:49.238 --> 32:53.442
I JUST NEVER GET TO TALK
ABOUT REX ANYMORE.

32:53.442 --> 32:57.446
SINCE I REMARRIED, IT JUST
DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE.

32:57.446 --> 32:59.548
I HADN'T REALIZED...

33:01.980 --> 33:03.982
(whispers)
HOW MUCH I MISS HIM.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.356
WELL, YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ABOUT HIM

33:07.356 --> 33:09.388
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.123
YOU HAVE HIS SMILE.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.106
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

33:27.106 --> 33:30.479
UH, MOSTLY KICKING MYSELF.

33:30.479 --> 33:33.382
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW I ACTED AT DINNER.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.444
WELL, IT WAS
A FRAUGHT SITUATION.

33:35.444 --> 33:38.147
THERE WAS BOUND TO BE
SOME SORT OF SCENE.

33:38.147 --> 33:40.319
LOOK,
I-I KNOW HE'S MY BROTHER,

33:40.319 --> 33:42.321
AND I KNOW I SHOULD TRY
TO LIKE HIM,

33:42.321 --> 33:44.053
BUT THERE'S--

33:44.053 --> 33:48.197
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
I JUST DON'T TRUST.

33:48.197 --> 33:52.061
HMM.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
 YOU DO?

33:52.061 --> 33:55.164
HE'S TRYING AWFULLY HARD
TO GET CLOSE TO BREE.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.436
I, FOR ONE,
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.738
YOU THINK
HE HAS AN AGENDA?

33:59.738 --> 34:02.171
WE ALL HAVE AGENDAS,
ANDREW.

34:02.171 --> 34:05.344
MINE IS TO PROTECT
YOUR MOTHER.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.816
AND WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW
ABOUT SAM?

34:07.816 --> 34:10.349
JUST THE STUFF HE TELLS US.

34:10.349 --> 34:14.422
HMM. IT SEEMS A BIT TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE, DOESN'T IT?

34:14.422 --> 34:17.326
MAYBE... MY AGENDA SHOULD BE

34:17.326 --> 34:20.058
TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING I CAN.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.360
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?

34:22.360 --> 34:25.393
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.295
(children laughing in distance,
door opens)

34:27.295 --> 34:29.838
HEY, JEAN. QUICK QUESTION.

34:29.838 --> 34:33.572
HOW IS M.J. DOING?
 YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO SEE
A LITTLE MORE EFFORT IN MATH.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.405
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
NOT IN CLASS.

34:36.405 --> 34:39.408
I MEAN THE CANDY DRIVE.
TODAY'S THE LAST DAY.
 OH, SUSAN,
YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD.

34:39.408 --> 34:43.382
HE IS A SELLING MACHINE, WAY OUT
AHEAD OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL...
 (squeals) YES!

34:43.382 --> 34:44.713
EXCEPT FOR JUANITA SOLIS.

34:44.713 --> 34:48.357
NO.
 BUT DON'T WORRY.
SHE IS JUST TWO BARS AHEAD.

34:48.357 --> 34:50.359
YOU BETTER GET HIM OUT THERE.

34:50.359 --> 34:52.661
GABY SOLIS TOLD ME
SHE'S TAKING JUANITA TO SELL

34:52.661 --> 34:55.393
OUTSIDE A WEIGHT LOSS CLINIC.
KA-CHING!

34:55.393 --> 34:59.228
(sighs)

34:59.228 --> 35:01.430
(children laughing)

35:12.811 --> 35:15.214
MRS. DELFINO, CAN I GO NOW?

35:15.214 --> 35:19.188
MY MOM WANTS TO PICK ME UP
A COUPLE MINUTES EARLY.
 DOES SHE?

35:19.188 --> 35:22.251
(children speaking indistinctly)

35:23.852 --> 35:25.354
SURE, SWEETHEART.

35:25.354 --> 35:29.428
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HELP VANESSA
PUT HER BRUSHES AWAY FIRST?

35:30.859 --> 35:33.532
(brushes clatter)

35:43.612 --> 35:45.474
(cell phone rings)

35:45.474 --> 35:47.476
(ring)

35:47.476 --> 35:49.678
(gasps) WHAT IS THAT?

35:49.678 --> 35:54.353
DID SOMEONE BRING A CELL PHONE
INTO MY CLASSROOM?

35:54.353 --> 35:58.227
(gasps) JUANITA SOLIS.

35:58.227 --> 36:00.229
IS THIS YOUR CELL PHONE?

36:00.229 --> 36:01.490
NO.

36:01.490 --> 36:04.433
OH, COME ON NOW.
IT WAS IN YOUR BAG.

36:04.433 --> 36:06.395
WHOSE ELSE COULD IT BE?

36:06.395 --> 36:09.898
YOURS. MY MOM GAVE IT TO YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

36:09.898 --> 36:13.602
OH.

36:13.602 --> 36:16.705
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT--
THAT YOU STOLE IT?

36:16.705 --> 36:19.448
NO.
 NOW YOU'RE YELLING AT ME.

36:19.448 --> 36:22.351
SOMEONE JUST BOUGHT HERSELF
THREE HOURS OF DETENTION.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.355
(cell phone rings)

36:26.355 --> 36:28.757
(ring)

36:28.757 --> 36:30.719
HELLO?

36:30.719 --> 36:34.793
OH, HI, PRINCIPAL HOBSON.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

36:34.793 --> 36:36.465
DETENTION?

36:36.465 --> 36:39.468
NO, NO, NO, NO. WE ONLY HAVE
A FEW HOURS LEFT TO SELL CANDY.

36:39.468 --> 36:41.870
WHO GAVE HER DETENTION?

36:41.870 --> 36:44.433
SHE DID, HUH?

36:44.433 --> 36:45.674
(scoffs)

36:48.277 --> 36:50.379
THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

36:50.379 --> 36:51.510
(beep)

36:55.514 --> 36:56.915
(singsong voice) HI, M.J.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.918
YOU MUST BE GETTING THIRSTY,
WALKING AROUND IN THIS HEAT.

36:59.918 --> 37:05.254
DOESN'T A NICE, BIG,
ICE-COLD CUP OF SODA SOUND GOOD?

37:14.463 --> 37:17.706
(click)

37:21.740 --> 37:24.443
(telephone rings)

37:24.443 --> 37:28.447
(ring, beep)

37:28.447 --> 37:31.380
HELLO?
 I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO YOU.

37:31.380 --> 37:33.852
Check your cell phone.

37:35.584 --> 37:38.587
(beep)
 (gasps)

37:38.587 --> 37:40.489
M.J.

37:40.489 --> 37:42.791
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT SELLING.

37:42.791 --> 37:45.494
HE WAS. THEN YOU GAVE
MY DAUGHTER DETENTION.

37:45.494 --> 37:46.835
BAD MOVE.

37:46.835 --> 37:49.298
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:49.298 --> 37:51.340
LET HER GO,
AND I LET HIM GO.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.502
I DON'T TRUST YOU.
 I DON'T BLAME YOU.

37:53.502 --> 37:55.344
BRING HIM HERE.

37:55.344 --> 37:56.845
WE'LL MAKE THE EXCHANGE.

37:56.845 --> 37:58.847
FINE. BUT I'M WARNING YOU,

37:58.847 --> 38:02.451
IF THERE IS ONE CHOCOLATE BAR
MISSING FROM THAT GIRL'S BOX,

38:02.451 --> 38:04.813
you'll answer to me.

38:16.064 --> 38:18.296
(children shouting indistinctly
in distance)

38:18.296 --> 38:20.369
YOUR MOM WILL BE HERE SOON.
DON'T WORRY.

38:20.369 --> 38:24.072
YOU'LL BE OUT
SELLING YOUR CANDY IN NO TIME.

38:24.072 --> 38:26.575
I HOPE SO.

38:26.575 --> 38:28.036
I GOTTA WIN.

38:28.036 --> 38:29.678
YOU KNOW, JUANITA,

38:29.678 --> 38:32.411
THERE ARE OTHER KIDS
THAT WANT TO WIN, TOO.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.413
I KNOW.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.315
I JUST WANT MY MOM
TO BE PROUD OF ME.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.849
YOUR MOM IS PROUD OF YOU.

38:40.849 --> 38:42.991
SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE'S EMBARRASSED

38:42.991 --> 38:45.454
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

38:45.454 --> 38:47.456
EVERY DAY I COME HOME,

38:47.456 --> 38:51.600
AND SHE ASKS, "DID YOU MAKE
ANY FRIENDS TODAY?"

38:51.600 --> 38:54.833
OH, SHE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE HAPPY, SWEETIE.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.465
THAT'S ALL.

38:56.465 --> 38:59.408
I GUESS.

38:59.408 --> 39:03.572
I JUST WISH I COULD MAKE FRIENDS
AS EASY AS SHE DOES.

39:03.572 --> 39:06.575
I TRY AND I TRY,
BUT I JUST CAN'T.

39:08.817 --> 39:11.380
HELLO. WE WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN HERE SOONER,

39:11.380 --> 39:13.622
BUT YOUR SON CAN'T HOLD
HIS SODA.

39:13.622 --> 39:16.525
JUANITA, COME ON.
WE GOT CANDY TO SELL.

39:16.525 --> 39:18.557
(sighs)

39:18.557 --> 39:20.559
MOM, WE GOTTA GO, TOO.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.861
OTHERWISE,
JUANITA'S GONNA BEAT ME.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.935
SWEETIE, UM...

39:26.935 --> 39:30.038
I KNOW YOU WANT TO WIN,

39:30.038 --> 39:34.743
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT WINNING REALLY MEANS.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.609
(gasps)

39:43.381 --> 39:46.054
I'VE REHEARSED THIS SPEECH
A HUNDRED TIMES.

39:46.054 --> 39:49.558
WELL, I THINK I KNOW
HOW IT ENDS. (chuckles)

39:51.590 --> 39:53.592
I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE

39:53.592 --> 39:55.964
WITH EVERYONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

39:55.964 --> 39:59.397
WATCHING ME AND JUDGING ME.

39:59.397 --> 40:03.131
I CARE TOO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

40:05.534 --> 40:07.476
SO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

40:07.476 --> 40:09.407
YEAH.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.780
YEAH. (sniffles)

40:11.780 --> 40:15.183
BUT IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND...

40:15.183 --> 40:18.086
I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU.

40:19.488 --> 40:20.989
SERIOUSLY?

40:20.989 --> 40:24.893
I WANT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE HAVE HERE,

40:24.893 --> 40:28.627
AND ONCE I KNOW...

40:28.627 --> 40:32.601
(whispers) MAYBE I WON'T
CARE WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

40:32.601 --> 40:35.564
(gasps)

40:35.564 --> 40:37.866
WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

40:37.866 --> 40:40.469
WHAT?

40:40.469 --> 40:44.943
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE PARIS. (chuckles)

40:46.645 --> 40:50.479
(laughs)

40:52.721 --> 40:56.024
AND THE WINNER OF
THIS YEAR'S CANDY DRIVE IS...

40:56.024 --> 40:57.626
JUANITA SOLIS!

40:59.628 --> 41:02.861
(squeals) WHOO!
 (cheering)

41:02.861 --> 41:06.194
(singsong voice)
WHOO-HOO! WE DID IT!

41:06.194 --> 41:07.195
(laughs)

41:07.195 --> 41:09.968
(normal voice) YOU DID IT.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.742
OKAY, NOW GO INVITE YOUR
BRAND-NEW FRIENDS TO YOUR PARTY.

41:13.742 --> 41:15.203
MRS. HENDERSON?

41:15.203 --> 41:17.906
TELL ME. WAS IT CLOSE?

41:17.906 --> 41:19.978
REALLY CLOSE,
UNTIL THE LAST DAY,

41:19.978 --> 41:23.111
WHEN JUANITA SOLD 40 BARS,
AND M.J. DIDN'T SELL ANY.

41:23.111 --> 41:25.684
REALLY?

41:25.684 --> 41:27.686
THAT'S WEIRD. (chuckles)

41:29.788 --> 41:31.489
(children speaking indistinctly)

41:31.489 --> 41:33.221
HEY.

41:33.221 --> 41:35.123
M.J.

41:35.123 --> 41:37.125
I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T WIN.

41:37.125 --> 41:38.767
THAT'S OKAY.

41:38.767 --> 41:41.770
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.

41:41.770 --> 41:44.573
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T SELL
ANY CANDY YESTERDAY?

41:46.605 --> 41:48.607
MY MOM SAYS IT'S A SECRET.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.509
SHE SAYS IT'S ONLY A GOOD DEED
IF WE DON'T TELL.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.514
(all speaking inaudibly)

41:56.514 --> 41:58.216
(sighs)

42:00.549 --> 42:03.622
WELL, YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO YOUR MOTHER...

42:05.123 --> 42:09.527
BECAUSE SHE IS A WINNER,
JUST LIKE YOU.

42:09.527 --> 42:14.663
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO WIN
IN THIS WORLD.

42:14.663 --> 42:18.567
SOME BATTLES ARE WON

42:18.567 --> 42:21.539
WITH A HASTY RETREAT.

42:21.539 --> 42:25.173
SOME VICTORIES ARE CLAIMED...

42:25.173 --> 42:28.316
BY THOSE WILLING TO CHEAT.

42:28.316 --> 42:32.220
SOME OPPONENTS ARE DEFEATED...

42:32.220 --> 42:34.322
WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A SMILE.

42:34.322 --> 42:36.224
(chuckles)

42:36.224 --> 42:39.157
OF COURSE, FOR SOME,

42:39.157 --> 42:42.030
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO WIN.

42:42.030 --> 42:44.292
SOMEONE ELSE...

42:44.292 --> 42:48.597
HAS GOT TO LOSE.
