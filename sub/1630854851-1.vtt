- What?

49:33.212 --> 49:34.637
They asked me my body type.

I'm like, "I'm curvy.
I look good.

49:36.866 --> 49:39.700

49:50.213 --> 49:51.988

49:52.215 --> 49:53.638

for it in other ways.

49:53.733 --> 49:55.157

51:20.803 --> 51:21.985
Like, once this year,
but there's more to it

51:22.080 --> 51:23.487

- Right.

are you guys planning

51:41.841 --> 51:44.491
To consummate the marriage?

51:44.510 --> 51:46.769
- Typically,
back in my dating days,

51:46.920 --> 51:48.996
It was like, you know,
we hook up the first day,

51:49.014 --> 51:50.331
Probably not gonna be, like,
a lasting relationship.

51:50.349 --> 51:51.923
- Right. Right.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.183
- But then it's like
we go into this thing,

51:53.336 --> 51:54.610
And it's a little bit
different.

51:54.761 --> 51:56.595
You know,
we're getting married.

51:56.689 --> 51:59.431
Obviously, there's a different
standard there, so...

51:59.525 --> 52:02.176
- I'm optimistic enough
to know that it may happen.

52:02.194 --> 52:03.861
But if it don't happen,
then I won't be mad.

52:04.013 --> 52:05.621
Like, we got
a lifetime together.

52:05.848 --> 52:07.848
- I'm gonna accept whatever
the first night.

52:07.867 --> 52:10.775

is sleeping on the couch

52:10.870 --> 52:13.629

all, you know, so...

52:17.209 --> 52:18.634

52:18.785 --> 52:20.619

52:20.638 --> 52:22.713
And just, like, we're finishing
each other's thoughts,

52:22.807 --> 52:24.882
Like, it's game time.

52:25.034 --> 52:26.533
- I don't really agree
with that,

52:26.552 --> 52:28.385
Simply because
you just got married.

52:30.206 --> 52:31.647

52:36.637 --> 52:38.821
You just become, like,
a nympho to having sex.

52:39.048 --> 52:41.157

positivity, right?

52:41.308 --> 52:42.807
And I'm putting that out
into the ether.

52:42.827 --> 52:44.401
- You gotta manifest it.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.886
- And so hopefully,
the universe says, "yup,

52:45.905 --> 52:47.388
She's gonna be feeling
the same way."

52:47.406 --> 52:48.998
I mean, it's gonna be
wedding night.

52:49.149 --> 52:50.982
There's no rules for this.

52:54.397 --> 52:56.172

52:56.323 --> 52:58.248

a day of getting married,

52:58.401 --> 53:00.009
