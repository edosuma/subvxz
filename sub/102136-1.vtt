Look at you, sitting there.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.160
You think you’re good people.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.872
You’re not good people.

01:21.332 --> 01:25.085
Trust me, there’s no
such thing as good people.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.257
I used to be like you...

01:31.550 --> 01:34.470
thinking that working hard
and playing fair

01:34.553 --> 01:37.598
would lead to success
and happiness.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.560
It doesn’t.

01:41.644 --> 01:45.022
Playing fair is a joke
invented by rich people

01:45.105 --> 01:47.358
to keep the rest of us poor.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.361
[song continues]

01:52.404 --> 01:54.240
And I’ve been poor.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.328
It doesn’t agree with me.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.292
’Cause there’s two types
of people in this world:

02:05.376 --> 02:07.169
the people who take...

02:07.253 --> 02:09.588
and those getting took.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.592
Predators and prey.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.013
Lions and lambs.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.686
My name is Marla Grayson,
and I’m not a lamb.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.524
I am a fucking lioness.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.098

03:01.181 --> 03:04.560
[man] She’s my mother.
I should be able to see her
whenever I want.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.604
She doesn’t need
to be in a care facility.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.522
She doesn’t need
a court-appointed guardian.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.482
She has a loving son
to take care of her.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.443
I don’t understand
how the court

03:12.526 --> 03:14.320
can entrust my mother
to this stranger.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.780
Miss Grayson forced my mother
into the home

03:16.864 --> 03:19.783
when she made it very clear
that she didn’t wanna go.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.287
And now she has auctioned off
my mother’s house, her car,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.955
her personal belongings.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.791
And she uses the proceeds
to pay herself.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.337
And now Miss Grayson
has barred me from
seeing my mother at all.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.256
It’s a goddamn nightmare.
She has kidnapped my mother!

03:34.340 --> 03:36.717
Please, sir, calm down.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.262
Marla Grayson
is a well-respected
professional guardian

03:40.346 --> 03:43.015
and has been appointed
by this court, by me,

03:43.098 --> 03:46.518
to look after the best interests
of your mother now that she
cannot look after herself.

03:46.602 --> 03:50.105
How is it in my mother’s
best interest to have her son
barred from seeing her?

03:50.189 --> 03:52.191
Miss Grayson doesn’t care
about my mother at all.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.193
Excuse me, Your Honor.
May I speak?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.654
[judge] Go ahead, Miss Grayson.

03:59.365 --> 04:03.077
Mr. Feldstrom, sir,
I sympathize.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.579
But the court doesn’t
appoint me for no reason.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.665
Your mother couldn’t cope
on her own.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.502
-That is not true.
-A doctor diagnosed her
with dementia

04:11.585 --> 04:16.006
and wrote an affidavit
recommending immediate action
be taken for her safety.

04:16.090 --> 04:19.885
You had ample opportunity
to move your mother
into a care facility

04:19.969 --> 04:22.012
or into your home.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.097
You did neither.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.392
She didn’t want to
leave her home.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.102
She begged me not to--

04:28.185 --> 04:30.646
You can’t care for her
by doing what she wants.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.815
You have to do
what she needs.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.359
And that is why
I can care better
than a family member,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.486
because I have
no skin in the game.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.072
I just do what is right
for your mother.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.033
I manage your mother’s money
because someone has to.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.744
She’d let it run
into quite a mess.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.997
And I have to pay for
her care in the facility,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.082
so, yes, I oversaw the sale

04:50.165 --> 04:52.292
of some of her assets
to finance that.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.336
And, yes, I pay myself too.

04:54.420 --> 04:58.674
Because caring, sir,
is my job, it’s my profession.

04:58.757 --> 05:03.512
This is what I do.
All day, every day, I care.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.974
I care for those who are
in need of protection,

05:07.057 --> 05:10.894
protection from apathy,
protection from their own pride

05:10.978 --> 05:14.398
and, quite often, protection
from their own children.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.192
-Hey! No!
-[Marla] Your Honor, you and I
have seen it many times,

05:17.276 --> 05:21.447
offspring who are willing
to let their parents starve
in squalor

05:21.530 --> 05:24.908
and struggle with pain

05:24.992 --> 05:28.787
rather than dip
into what they see
as their inheritance

05:28.871 --> 05:31.206
to pay for the necessary care.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.296
Mr. Feldstrom, sir...

05:39.506 --> 05:41.550
I sympathize, I do,

05:41.633 --> 05:44.470
but your visits
to your mother upset her,

05:44.553 --> 05:46.472
and the last time
you visited her,

05:46.555 --> 05:51.018
you assaulted a staff member
and vandalized a reception area.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.771
Is that not true?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.734
Well...

05:58.817 --> 06:01.070
[Marla] Your Honor,
I think it’s obvious

06:01.153 --> 06:04.281
why the non-visitation order
must be upheld.

06:04.364 --> 06:09.161
This court is doing its best
to protect and help
Mrs. Feldstrom,

06:09.244 --> 06:11.371
and the actions of her son

06:11.455 --> 06:16.210
are undermining
our every effort in that fight.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.966
I agree. Order upheld.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.118
-Then he can use my name.
-Bitch. Hey.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.371

how you live with yourself.
Our lives are being ruined.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.289

07:00.129 --> 07:01.880

07:08.345 --> 07:10.681

because I’m a woman?

07:10.764 --> 07:14.268
That you got
so soundly beaten in there
by someone with a vagina?

07:14.351 --> 07:17.396
Having a penis doesn’t
automatically make you
more scary to me,

just the opposite.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.732

your dick and balls

Just your regular old lady.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.429
-And she is sitting
on a pile of cash.
-Mm-hmm.

14:07.430 --> 14:11.059
She’s rich, independent,
literate.

14:11.142 --> 14:14.604
That lady right there,
she’s my fucking hero.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.074
Karen. It’s Marla.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.661
Pull the trigger
on Jennifer Peterson.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.163
You’ll get the stock
you want.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.962
[Karen] Miss Peterson
is often confused

14:39.045 --> 14:42.007
and has exhibited
memory and coping issues.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.967
Her mobility is compromised.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.678
She cannot take
adequate care of herself,

14:46.761 --> 14:50.307
and I believe she is
at high risk if left alone
in her own home.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.058
She has no family?

14:52.142 --> 14:55.186
She has no one to care for her,
except us.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.065
That’s terrible. Poor woman.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.736
[sighs] Okay, Miss Grayson.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.488
Do you think
you can take her on
as one of your wards?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.241
I know you have a lot
in your fold already.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.492
Um...

15:14.331 --> 15:16.124
Yes, Your Honor, I...

15:16.207 --> 15:18.627
If you need me
to take care of her,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.128
I can take care of her.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.756
[judge] Thank you, Marla.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.602
[kettle whistling]

15:40.190 --> 15:43.193
[piano music playing]

15:55.914 --> 15:57.332
[knocking on door]

16:12.138 --> 16:14.766
Miss Peterson?
My name is Marla Grayson.

16:14.849 --> 16:17.477
I work with Dr. Karen Amos,
your physician.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.063
May I speak with you
for a minute?

16:23.358 --> 16:27.320
Good morning, Miss Peterson.
I’m sorry to disturb you
so early.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.406
-You’re a doctor?
-No, ma’am.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.824
May I show you this?

16:33.076 --> 16:36.538
Oh, I’m gonna need
my reading glasses.
I’ll be right back.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.555
You know,
I’m not sure what this is.

16:53.638 --> 16:57.016
-It’s a court order, ma’am.
-A court order?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.227
But what’s that
got to do with me?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.438
That’s your name, correct?
Jennifer Peterson.

17:01.521 --> 17:05.400
Your date of birth,
social security number
and this address.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.777
Oh, my goodness.
Have I done something wrong?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.988
Oh, no, ma’am.
This is to help you.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.574
The court has ruled,
under the guidance
of your doctor,

17:12.657 --> 17:15.410
that you require assistance
in taking care of yourself.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.163
The court has appointed me
to be your legal guardian.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.873
What?

17:19.956 --> 17:22.125
When we cease to be able
to take care of ourselves,

17:22.208 --> 17:23.918
the state steps in to help.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.629
We can’t just sit by
while people struggle.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.381
[laughs]

17:29.507 --> 17:32.093
Yeah, but I’m not struggling.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.680
I’m fine. I’m more than fine.
I don’t need help.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.600
I’m afraid it’s not
up to you or me to decide.

17:38.683 --> 17:42.687
The court has ruled
that you do need help and,
as your legal guardian,

17:42.771 --> 17:46.983
it’s my duty to ensure that
adequate care is supplied
to you at all times.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
Let me tell you something.
I never went to court.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.196
This is the first thing
I’ve heard about court.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.072
In emergencies,
the court can convene

17:53.156 --> 17:55.116
without the presence
of the prospective ward.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.076
Wow. That’s crazy.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.453
Well, ma’am...

17:58.536 --> 18:00.246
You have to come with me.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.916
-I’m not going anywhere.
-This is a court order.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.878
And if you don’t comply with it,
I’m afraid you may be
in some trouble.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.467
[Jennifer] Oh, my God.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.971
If you feel
there’s been an error,

18:17.055 --> 18:19.182
report it to the court,
request a hearing.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.017
But, for now,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.228
I suggest you come with me
temporarily

18:23.311 --> 18:25.355
to the care facility
I’ve found for you,

18:25.438 --> 18:28.650
and if there’s been a mistake,
we can address it from there.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.902
This is Frances.
She will help you
pack a suitcase.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.071
Good morning, Mrs. Peterson.
Pleasure to meet you.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.157
-I don’t believe
this is happening.
-It’s totally fine.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.368
-Don’t touch me.
-I’m sorry. I’ll help you.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.161
Don’t touch me.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.415
Beautiful house, Mrs. Peterson.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.428
Let me help you with those.

18:57.512 --> 19:00.473
I’ll be overseeing
the upkeep of your property
until you sort this out.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.433
[Fran] Let’s go.
We just wanna make sure

19:02.517 --> 19:04.811
that your property’s
taken care of safely.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.483
Thanks, Curtis. Seat belt.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.257
[ring back tone]

19:34.340 --> 19:37.135
[Sam] Marla, how’s it going?
You have to drag her out
by her ankles?

19:37.218 --> 19:40.471
No, she packed and walked.
Hardly any of them fight.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.892
They see the official paper,
they see the cops,
they go right along.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.227
-Yeah, I’d fucking fight.
-You say that,

19:46.311 --> 19:50.231
but at heart
most of us are weak,
compliant and scared.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.110
True. Hey, you ever hear
about the Milgram experiment?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.821
Not now, Sam.
We’re already in transit.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.407
-[Sam] All right.
-[Marla] Oh, Sam.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.534
I need the full works
for this one.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.952
[Sam] Copy that.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.843
[muted]

20:40.865 --> 20:43.076
[muted]

21:11.604 --> 21:13.147
Welcome home.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.775
Come on in.

21:16.651 --> 21:18.736
-Wow.
-[Sam chuckles]

21:18.820 --> 21:21.739
-I’d forgotten
how big they are.
-[Sam] Yes.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.909
Why don’t you take a seat?

21:25.952 --> 21:29.122
So you feel at home.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.375
They have all
your medical details,
all your prescriptions.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.961
You don’t have to worry.
They’ll take care of all of it.

21:35.044 --> 21:41.134
Now, if you need me
at any time, night or day,
you just ask, okay?

21:41.884 --> 21:43.136
You have a cell phone?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.514
Unlock it.
I’ll store my number.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.737
If you need to make a call,
you just ask, okay?

22:02.447 --> 22:06.409
Now, Miss Peterson,
I wanna say I’m honored
to be your guardian.

22:06.492 --> 22:10.788
[softly] And remember,
I’m on your side.
I’m here to help.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.210
Sam, you treat this lady
like a queen. You hear me?

22:16.294 --> 22:18.087
-Anything she wants.
-Absolutely.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.800
You take care, Miss Peterson.
We’ll talk soon.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.017
[door closes]

22:53.247 --> 22:56.667
[indistinct chatter]

22:58.795 --> 23:02.673
[indistinct]

23:14.769 --> 23:18.106
Can you open the door?
I just wanna get some air.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.983
-You gotta go that way.
-I just wanna get some air.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.694
Could you open the door
so I can get some air?

23:23.778 --> 23:26.030
-You gotta go back
that way.
-Huh?

23:26.114 --> 23:28.074
-Sorry?
-I just need
to get you back...

23:57.395 --> 23:58.855
[Fran]
Hey, can you grab those?

24:06.028 --> 24:08.072
Thank you, sir.
It’s been a pleasure.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.124
Sold.

24:31.596 --> 24:32.972
[drops keys]

24:36.642 --> 24:38.811
[Marla]
God, I love your ass.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.531
Hi. I wondered
if you could help me, please.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.367
I need my cell phone.
Could you find it for me?

24:55.328 --> 24:58.956
Miss Peterson,
cell phones are kept secure
for the safety of our guests.

24:59.040 --> 25:03.002
-My cell phone won’t hurt you.
-Our policy is to get
your guardian involved.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.922
No, no, no, no.
I don’t want my guardian.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.342
-Can I speak to the manager?
-Mr. Rice is unavailable.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.094
Mr. Rice is here,
but he’s unavailable.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.763
[shouting] Mr. Rice!

25:13.846 --> 25:16.057
-Calm down.
-Don’t touch me.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.352
-Why are you
touching me like this?
-Everything’s gonna be fine.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.438
Go away from me. No, no, no,
don’t let her do that.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.649
-Calm down.
-Don’t let her do that to me.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.202
Nice to see you.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.662
[muted]

25:41.290 --> 25:42.959
Okay.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.586
Is this the key to one of
your safety deposit boxes?

26:39.432 --> 26:41.100
[indistinct]

27:13.758 --> 27:15.384
[knocking on door]

27:17.553 --> 27:19.138
Taxi for Miss Peterson.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.766
Oh, she doesn’t live here
anymore.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.392
What?

27:24.393 --> 27:27.146
She moved.
Miss Peterson moved.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.652
Oh. My mistake. Thank you.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.867
Excuse me. Who called you?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.119
Excuse me!

27:49.919 --> 27:51.670
Fuck.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.824
Sir, he’s alone.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.429
So, where is she?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
She wasn’t at the house.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.227
-You were there on time?
-Yes. Yes, sir.

29:30.311 --> 29:35.191
Mm... No. In seven years,
she’s never missed
an appointment.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.152
[Alexi panting]

29:39.028 --> 29:41.530
The house was changed, uh...

29:41.614 --> 29:44.158
It had been, um, cleared out

29:44.241 --> 29:48.412
and there was
a "For Sale" sign out front.

29:48.496 --> 29:51.040
There’s people inside.
They were painting walls.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.250
I spoke to a woman
with some swatches

29:53.334 --> 29:56.629
and she said that
she didn’t live there anymore.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.426
I don’t understand.

30:02.510 --> 30:05.596
What people were in there?
Where is she now?

30:05.679 --> 30:08.557
Oh, I don’t know.
I came straight here.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.728
You didn’t think to ask?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.022
Even though you know
how important this is to me,

30:15.105 --> 30:19.151
you didn’t think to get
some basic information
on the situation?

30:36.752 --> 30:38.170
[car door closes]

30:48.180 --> 30:50.766
[Alexi, mumbling]
Sir, if...

30:53.769 --> 30:55.437
[exhales deeply]

31:07.741 --> 31:10.869
Please, sir... Please.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.664
[stammering] I figured...
I would... Before any...

31:14.623 --> 31:16.667
You fucked up, Alexi.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.882
I love my mother very much.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.428
And these days, these rare days
that we get to spend together,

31:27.511 --> 31:29.388
are a blessing for me.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.765
Yes, sir. Of course.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.768
So, you find her
and bring her to me.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.564
-[whispering] Now.
-Of course. Yes, sir.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.614
[taxi engine revs]

31:46.697 --> 31:47.990
[tires screeching]

31:56.206 --> 31:58.959
[Marla] And I open the pouch,
and what’s inside?

31:59.043 --> 32:02.046
Diamonds. Lots.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.340
-Just loose diamonds?
-Mm-hmm.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.467
This is her insurance
for the safe deposit box.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.428
She lists the gold,
the jewelry, the bonds,

32:09.511 --> 32:11.555
but not the diamonds.

32:11.639 --> 32:14.308
She insures a $600 watch,

32:14.391 --> 32:17.269
but not millions of dollars’
worth of diamonds.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.146
Do you think they’re stolen?

32:19.229 --> 32:21.023
Probably.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.733
[Fran]
She doesn’t seem that type.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.693
[Marla]
Don’t get fooled by old people.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.446
Even sadistic,
immoral assholes get old.

32:29.198 --> 32:33.077
But you’re missing the point.
These diamonds
don’t officially exist.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.579
So...

32:36.997 --> 32:38.999
no one would ever miss them.

32:44.755 --> 32:45.839
[door closes]

32:52.346 --> 32:54.431
-You wanna steal them.
-No.

32:55.933 --> 32:59.061
I wanna change their location
for a while for safekeeping...

33:01.355 --> 33:02.940
and see what happens.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.997
[choral music playing]

33:24.712 --> 33:25.921
[knocking on door]

33:32.720 --> 33:34.221
Yes?

33:34.304 --> 33:36.557
Sorry, sir.
I can come back later if...

33:43.355 --> 33:44.940
Did you find my mother?

33:45.733 --> 33:46.817
Uh...

33:47.609 --> 33:48.819
Sort of.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.239
[man] She’s in a care home?

33:52.322 --> 33:55.200
As far as I can tell, sir.
I couldn’t get access.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.952
[knocking]

33:57.035 --> 33:58.078
[door opens]

34:01.832 --> 34:04.918
Sir, the latest batch of mules
arrived this morning.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.635
-Did we lose any in transit?
-Three.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.514
We’re getting
the product from the others
at the Medfield property.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.600
Is that my smoothie?

34:27.024 --> 34:29.151
[whispering]
I don’t understand.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.323
She checked herself
into a care home?

34:34.406 --> 34:38.535
No. Uh, she’s there
by court order.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.746
She’s now a ward of the state.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.123
Your... Your mother’s doctor

34:43.207 --> 34:46.001
deemed her incapable
of taking care of herself.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.294
[slurping]

34:48.879 --> 34:51.215
-But that’s bullshit.
-[chuckles]

34:51.298 --> 34:53.300
Yes, sir. Yes.

34:53.383 --> 34:55.344
So how did this happen?

34:56.512 --> 34:57.888
Um...

35:00.516 --> 35:02.601
Marla Grayson.

35:02.684 --> 35:06.814
I believe she made it happen.
She’s your mother’s guardian.

35:06.897 --> 35:11.485
She now has full control
of your mother’s life
and assets.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.778
Fuck!

35:12.861 --> 35:13.946
[grunts]

35:27.125 --> 35:28.418
Call Dean.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.297
Get my mother out of that home
and keep her out.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.842
Do it quietly,

35:34.925 --> 35:36.927
do it legally, do it fast.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.470
Keep me away from it.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.763
Yes, sir.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.977
No, no, no, no.
Leave the photograph.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.523
[door opens]

35:49.606 --> 35:50.607
[door closes]

36:35.694 --> 36:38.780
Marla Grayson?
Pleasure to meet you.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.617
-Dean Ericson.
-He says he has
an appointment.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.661
-He’s not in the book.
-I need five minutes
of your time.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.413
It’s very important.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.916
You can have two minutes.

36:49.875 --> 36:50.876
[Addie sighs]

36:54.087 --> 36:55.714
[exhales deeply]

36:57.507 --> 37:01.595
This is a beautiful office.
Very stylish.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.347
These all your wards?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.683
What can I do for you,
Mr. Ericson?

37:06.767 --> 37:10.270
That must be
a hell of a responsibility,
all these people.

37:10.354 --> 37:13.857
I imagine the paperwork
is brutal.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.526
Take a seat, get to the point.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.487
-I’m a lawyer.
-I don’t need a lawyer.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.364
I represent Jennifer Peterson.

37:20.447 --> 37:23.533
-Really?
-Yes. And I think
there’s been a mistake.

37:23.617 --> 37:26.620
You see,
my client is very capable
of taking care of herself.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.081
She has no need for the care
of a guardian like yourself.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.500
Of course, this is
no reflection on you.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.337
I’m sure you’re providing
absolutely stellar care
for Miss Peterson.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.257
But the fact of the matter is
she does not need
nor want your care.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.510
She was perfectly fine
on her own.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.804
-She called you?
-What?

37:43.887 --> 37:45.889
Jennifer called you
from the facility?

37:46.723 --> 37:48.183
She did.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.561
Hmm. When did you
last see Jennifer?

37:51.645 --> 37:53.105
-Not long ago.
-How long ago?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.692
-Just a few weeks.
-A few? Two, three, four?

37:56.775 --> 38:01.113
Three, maybe four...
Three. And she was fine,
more than fine.

38:01.196 --> 38:04.616
She was fitter and more focused
than I am most of the time.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.160
[chuckles] I’m afraid
that explains it.

38:07.244 --> 38:11.623
Two weeks ago Jennifer’s health
took a severe downwards turn.

38:11.707 --> 38:14.793
She has memory loss
indicative of dementia.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.837
And her doctor
was so worried about her,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.840
she referred her to the courts
for emergency help.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.598
That’s simply not true,
Miss Grayson.

38:30.726 --> 38:35.313
You know it, I know it.
If the doctor wrote a note,
he knows it too.

38:35.397 --> 38:36.773
-She.
-What?

38:36.857 --> 38:38.483
She. The doctor,
she’s a she.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.819
Of course.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.947
Now, I know what you do here.

38:44.031 --> 38:46.074
I know your game, your hustle.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.535
-You do?
-I do, and honestly,
it’s a good one.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.454
You saw an opportunity
and you grabbed it.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.748
Look at all these cash cows
on your wall

38:52.831 --> 38:56.543
just leaking money
into your account
one overpriced hour at a time.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.754
Good for you. I’m not here
to ruin your business.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.465
I’m happy for you
to keep milking these
poor vulnerable people

39:01.548 --> 39:04.009
for as long as you
damn well please.

39:04.092 --> 39:08.430
Hell, if your whole enterprise
isn’t the perfect example
of the American dream,

39:08.513 --> 39:09.890
I don’t know what is.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.894
But not Jennifer Peterson.
She’s off-limits.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.271
And I understand
why you targeted her.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.982
I just responded to a call
from a doctor.

39:19.066 --> 39:22.152
Right, sure,
let’s stick with that.
But her doctor is mistaken.

39:22.235 --> 39:26.865
Understand? He...
Sorry, she fucked up.

39:26.948 --> 39:30.410
Jennifer needs to be released
from your care ASAP

39:30.494 --> 39:34.164
and you need to get
that she-doctor
to write another letter

39:34.247 --> 39:36.291
saying Jennifer has made
a full recovery

39:36.374 --> 39:39.336
and no longer needs to be
in the care of a guardian.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.965
Now, why the fuck
would I do that?

39:48.345 --> 39:52.057
Well, I can think
of two reasons.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.017
One, it is
the right thing to do,

39:54.101 --> 39:56.186
but I doubt that means
anything to you.

39:56.269 --> 40:01.858
And two, because she has
very powerful... friends

40:01.942 --> 40:04.027
who can make life
uncomfortable for you,

40:04.111 --> 40:07.405
extremely unpleasant
and uncomfortable.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.039
-Is that a threat?
-No.

40:16.123 --> 40:20.043
No, that’s just data
for you to... collate.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.004
How uncomfortable
are we talking?

40:23.088 --> 40:26.800
Uh, you know, aggressively
and excessively uncomfortable

40:26.883 --> 40:29.594
and then eventually, well...

40:31.263 --> 40:32.848
uh...

40:32.931 --> 40:35.559
let’s just say
you’ll not be comfortable

40:35.642 --> 40:38.854
or uncomfortable ever again.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.441
-Because I’ll be dead?
-Well, I didn’t say that.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.402
[Marla laughs]

40:45.485 --> 40:48.196
But we all die, right?

40:48.280 --> 40:52.409
Some of us die sooner
in a more horribly protracted
and painful way.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.622
-Who do you work for?
-Jennifer Peterson.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.416
-Liar.
-Excuse me?

40:59.499 --> 41:02.294
Liar. Jennifer did not call you
from the facility.

41:02.377 --> 41:05.755
You think I’m stupid enough
to let new wards anywhere
near a working phone?

41:05.839 --> 41:08.550
And I know from her paperwork
her lawyer is a local guy

41:08.633 --> 41:10.802
who deals in family law.

41:10.886 --> 41:13.054
And that’s not you.
You’re a shark,

41:13.138 --> 41:16.975
which intrigues me,
and I wanna know who hired you.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.352
-Release her from your care.
-No, Dean.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.938
I don’t think I will.

41:26.193 --> 41:27.444
[sighs]

41:33.950 --> 41:35.785
I didn’t wanna
have to do this.

41:41.833 --> 41:45.045
[sighing]
It’s $150,000 in cash.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.631
Well, that’s very pretty.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.507
It’s yours
when you release her.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.221
You know what I think, Dean?

41:55.430 --> 42:00.060
I think if your opening gambit
is 150 grand,

42:00.143 --> 42:03.271
then Jennifer Peterson
must be worth a lot more
than that

42:03.355 --> 42:05.065
to whoever it is
who sent you here.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.609
I can go to 250.

42:07.692 --> 42:11.112
How about... five million?

42:11.196 --> 42:12.322
[chuckles]

42:12.405 --> 42:14.324
-Three hundred.
-Million?

42:15.659 --> 42:19.079
Thousand. Final offer.

42:20.497 --> 42:23.541
Dean, I have a legal duty.

42:23.625 --> 42:26.753
Jennifer Peterson is in need
of my protection.

42:28.797 --> 42:30.757
How can I just abandon her?

42:33.385 --> 42:35.845
-Are you saying no?
-I’m saying no.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.974
I’m saying, "No, thank you."

42:46.231 --> 42:48.400
[Dean] In the days to come,

42:48.483 --> 42:52.320
you’ll replay this conversation
in your head over and over,

42:52.404 --> 42:54.864
and you’re gonna wish
you played it differently.

42:54.948 --> 42:56.616
Right now
look at what you have.

42:56.700 --> 43:00.036
A thriving business,
employees...

43:01.413 --> 43:04.457
a nice face,
unbroken bones,

43:05.292 --> 43:06.543
a life.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.087
When this is through,

43:09.170 --> 43:11.506
you’re not gonna have
any of those things.

43:12.507 --> 43:13.758
None of them.

43:21.349 --> 43:24.602
-Last chance.
-Goodbye, Dean.

43:24.686 --> 43:27.480
Curtis will validate
your parking on the way out.

43:44.414 --> 43:46.124
[Fran] I’ve looked
all through her records,

43:46.207 --> 43:48.376
all the way back
to her birth certificate.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.087
I can’t find anyone in her life
that we should be scared of.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.006
[Marla] Then who
is this lawyer?

43:53.089 --> 43:54.674
Maybe he knows about
the diamonds.

43:54.758 --> 43:57.135
Yeah, that’s my thought too.

43:57.218 --> 44:00.221
Maybe he’s cut in on them.
He’s scared we’ll find them.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.308
Maybe you should just
take the money.

44:03.391 --> 44:07.354
And give away
the biggest opportunity
we ever had?

44:07.437 --> 44:09.147
What if he’s saying
the truth?

44:09.230 --> 44:11.649
-With what?
-With threats.

44:11.733 --> 44:14.903
You know how many times
I’ve been threatened by a man?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.571
Thousands.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.115
You know how many of them
ever came to anything?

44:19.199 --> 44:20.283
Two.

44:21.701 --> 44:24.496
He made threats ’cause threats
are all he had left.

44:24.579 --> 44:27.248
You can’t convince a woman
to do what you want,

44:27.332 --> 44:30.168
then you call her a bitch
and threaten to kill her.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.755
I’m not scared of him.

44:37.425 --> 44:38.760
Okay.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.721
So, what are you thinking?

44:41.805 --> 44:45.350
I’m gonna talk to someone
who has all the answers.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.523
[Marla] How is she?

44:51.606 --> 44:54.943
[nurse]
She’s been pretty unsettled
since she got here.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.488
-[Marla] They always are.
-[nurse] Yeah,
but she’s extra extra.

44:58.571 --> 45:01.741
The doctor had to
adjust her medication
to calm her down.

45:01.825 --> 45:03.493
-Twice.
-Hmm.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.578
She’s in the games room.
I have to warn you,

45:05.662 --> 45:08.164
we had to bump her sedatives,
so she might be out of it.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.294
Jennifer.

45:14.712 --> 45:16.464
How are you feeling?

45:16.548 --> 45:20.260
-Why do I know you?
-I’m your guardian, Marla.

45:20.343 --> 45:24.973
Oh, thank God. I need help.
I need my cell phone.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.142
-To call who?
-What?

45:27.225 --> 45:29.978
-Who do you need to call?
-Why?

45:30.061 --> 45:34.107
Jennifer, do you know a man
named Dean Ericson?

45:35.567 --> 45:37.819
-Who? What?
-Dean.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.696
Dean Ericson. You know him?

45:39.779 --> 45:42.073
-Dean... No, I don’t.
-No?

45:42.157 --> 45:45.368
He says he works for you.
He says he’s a lawyer.

45:45.452 --> 45:46.453
Lawyer.

45:48.121 --> 45:50.457
Does he look expensive?

45:50.540 --> 45:53.668
Well... yeah, I guess.

45:54.461 --> 45:56.254
What’s the date?

45:56.337 --> 45:57.589
The 15th.

45:58.465 --> 46:00.300
Last week was the 8th.

46:00.383 --> 46:01.634
Right on.

46:04.137 --> 46:05.472
[laughs]

46:05.555 --> 46:07.015
[Marla chuckling]

46:09.684 --> 46:11.060
Oh...

46:12.061 --> 46:13.855
You’re in trouble now.

46:14.856 --> 46:16.441
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

46:16.524 --> 46:18.485
-He’s coming.
-Who? Dean?

46:19.319 --> 46:20.862
No.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.947
He’s coming.

46:24.407 --> 46:27.160
-Who?
-Just you wait.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.624
Jennifer, who are you?

46:35.084 --> 46:37.128
So much drugs.

46:38.046 --> 46:39.964
Drugs. I can’t think.

46:40.048 --> 46:41.674
Tell me who you are.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.010
Tell me.

46:45.887 --> 46:49.390
You know I have access
to your safety deposit box?

46:51.059 --> 46:53.061
I know what’s in there.

46:54.395 --> 46:57.899
There’s an envelope
inside a book.

46:59.275 --> 47:01.152
-Oh.
-Tell me who you are.

47:01.236 --> 47:03.196
Oh, you’re a robber.

47:03.279 --> 47:05.740
No, I’m your guardian.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.700
You’re my guardian robber.

47:07.784 --> 47:09.827
-Tell me who you are.
-[groggily] Ooh.

47:09.911 --> 47:12.789
Jennifer. Jennifer.
Tell me.

47:12.872 --> 47:15.792
I’m the worst mistake
you’ll ever make.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.461
Tell me.

47:18.545 --> 47:21.214
-Tell me.
-Cell phone.

47:21.965 --> 47:23.383
Tell me.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.344
You don’t give me
my cell phone,

47:26.427 --> 47:29.013
you don’t let me
get out of this place...

47:33.017 --> 47:35.019
I got nothing to say.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.398
-Listen to me.
-Nothing.

47:39.941 --> 47:44.571
I control your drugs,
your food, your comfort.

47:45.613 --> 47:48.366
-Everything. Me.
-[chuckles]

47:48.449 --> 47:49.951
-Not you, me.
-Yeah.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.954
And I can make things
very bad for you.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.330
You hear me?

47:55.498 --> 47:57.041
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

47:58.501 --> 48:02.630
Then have at it,
you little crock of cunt.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.716
Have at it.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.314
[nurse] Excuse me. Uh--

48:22.066 --> 48:26.738
Marla Grayson, my favorite lady.
[clears throat]

48:26.821 --> 48:29.657
Sam, I want you to adjust
Jennifer Peterson’s routine.

48:29.741 --> 48:31.409
Shoot.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.411
Take her arthritis
and pain meds down to minimum,

48:33.494 --> 48:35.788
push her physical exercise
to grade four level.

48:35.872 --> 48:37.874
-Marla...
-Give her an upper
at 9:00 at night,

48:37.957 --> 48:39.667
then sedatives in the day.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.836
Put her on
the basic food package.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.963
No solids,
just oatmeal and soup.

48:44.047 --> 48:46.215
No games, no TV

48:46.299 --> 48:49.093
and only 30 minutes a day
out of her room.

48:50.428 --> 48:51.971
Are you sure?

48:52.055 --> 48:54.807
I’m sure as fucking sure.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.311
-Okay.
-Thank you, Sam.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.395
Yeah.

50:09.090 --> 50:13.886
Your Honor, Jennifer Peterson
is being held against her will
in a care facility.

50:13.970 --> 50:17.473
She was put there by this woman
who has falsely asserted

50:17.557 --> 50:21.769
that Jennifer is of ill health
when, in fact,
she’s perfectly fine.

50:21.853 --> 50:24.564
Who are you, sir?
I’ve not seen you
in here before.

50:24.647 --> 50:27.817
Dean Ericson, Your Honor.
These are my associates.

50:27.900 --> 50:30.903
We represent the interests
of Jennifer Peterson,

50:30.987 --> 50:33.823
and I’m here to undo
a miscarriage of justice.

50:33.906 --> 50:37.326
Are you saying I am responsible
for a miscarriage of justice?

50:37.410 --> 50:40.329
Not deliberately, Your Honor.
You were lied to.

50:41.914 --> 50:44.208
My client was not invited

50:44.292 --> 50:47.462
to the original hearing,
and neither was
her representative.

50:47.545 --> 50:50.047
That’s perfectly normal
for an emergency hearing.

50:50.131 --> 50:52.341
But there was no emergency
in this case.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.677
It was a fiction
created by Miss Grayson

50:54.761 --> 50:58.055
to keep Jennifer out of sight
and trick the court.

50:58.139 --> 51:03.478
I have an affidavit here
from an ex-employee
from Dr. Amos’ practice

51:03.561 --> 51:05.438
who testifies to the fact

51:05.521 --> 51:09.317
that Miss Grayson and Dr. Amos
regularly colluded on cases

51:09.400 --> 51:10.860
to game the system.

51:12.445 --> 51:16.449
I quote: "Karen would palm off
difficult patients to Marla

51:16.532 --> 51:19.118
whether they needed
a guardian or not

51:19.202 --> 51:22.872
and then embellish symptoms
to sway the court."

51:23.664 --> 51:24.832
[scoffs]

51:24.916 --> 51:26.334
Your Honor...

51:29.462 --> 51:31.464
this is scandalous.

51:31.547 --> 51:33.132
[Marla] Judge, may I?

51:42.725 --> 51:44.393
Fiona Jacobs is your witness?

51:44.477 --> 51:47.772
Yes. She’s the employee, yes.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.525
Judge, you know
Fiona hates Karen.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.819
She’s not an impartial witness.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.904
Fiona has a vendetta
against Karen

51:54.987 --> 51:57.865
because Karen fired her
for being useless at her job.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.951
Or maybe Karen fired her

52:00.034 --> 52:02.495
because she uncovered
the true nature
of your operation.

52:02.578 --> 52:04.372
I know Fiona. She was useless.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.915
[stifled laughter]

52:07.917 --> 52:11.963
Judge, can I ask
why Jennifer is again
not present today?

52:12.046 --> 52:15.132
Jennifer is unwell.
I’m afraid she’s unable
to attend.

52:15.216 --> 52:18.636
I have submitted a letter
from her current doctor
attesting to that fact.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.305
Also I’ve been denied
any access to her, Judge.

52:21.389 --> 52:25.017
It’s as if Miss Grayson
has purposely
just kept me away from her.

52:25.101 --> 52:27.019
[judge]
Have you denied him access,
Marla?

52:27.103 --> 52:29.438
You can’t deny an attorney
access to his client.

52:29.522 --> 52:31.816
This man claims
to be her lawyer.

52:31.899 --> 52:35.278
He can produce
no piece of paper to prove it.
No contract, no retainer.

52:35.361 --> 52:38.948
He just suddenly appeared
in my office making threats
and accusations.

52:39.031 --> 52:42.451
Your Honor, more than once
you and I have seen
unscrupulous lawyers

52:42.535 --> 52:46.414
seeking to exploit the elderly
for their hard-earned savings.

52:46.497 --> 52:50.543
I think this is why
Mr. Ericson wants Miss Peterson
out of my protection.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.087
That’s the exact opposite
of what is happening.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.841
Can you present any paperwork
that proves you are
Miss Peterson’s lawyer?

52:56.924 --> 52:59.010
If I could just
get access to her,

52:59.093 --> 53:01.053
I guarantee you,
she would sign a retainer.

53:01.137 --> 53:03.389
So Jennifer Peterson hasn’t
retained you as her lawyer?

53:03.472 --> 53:05.850
I am acting on behalf
of concerned parties

53:05.933 --> 53:07.935
who are extremely worried
about Jennifer

53:08.019 --> 53:10.354
and the outrageous treatment
she’s been given.

53:10.438 --> 53:11.898
Who are these
concerned parties?

53:11.981 --> 53:14.150
I’m not at liberty
to reveal that information.

53:14.233 --> 53:16.736
They are friends
of Miss Peterson
who wish to remain anonymous.

53:16.819 --> 53:18.696
Sir, we’re going around
in circles.

53:18.779 --> 53:20.573
Either you show me
some paperwork

53:20.656 --> 53:23.159
that proves you are
Miss Peterson’s lawyer

53:23.242 --> 53:26.871
or you bring
these concerned parties
into a hearing

53:26.954 --> 53:29.123
and let them speak
for themselves.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.334
But for now, Mr. Ericson,

53:31.417 --> 53:35.171
your request to dissolve
this guardianship is denied.

53:35.254 --> 53:36.297
[gavel raps]

53:38.299 --> 53:40.009
[Dean] Sir. Sir. Sir.

53:40.092 --> 53:42.261
Look... Whoa!

53:42.345 --> 53:45.514
Okay! It’s family court, okay?

53:45.598 --> 53:48.726
The judge is an asshole.
He’s an idiot.
He doesn’t even know law.

53:48.809 --> 53:52.313
-He drives a fucking Subaru!
-[yelling] Stop talking!

53:53.022 --> 53:54.565
Stop!

53:56.484 --> 53:57.693
Fuck this.

54:32.186 --> 54:33.229
Good morning.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.064
[smarmy] Good morning.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.233
My name is Walter Smith.

54:37.316 --> 54:40.736
These are my brothers,
Tony and Chad.

54:40.820 --> 54:44.240
I spoke to your manager,
Mr. Rice, this morning

54:44.323 --> 54:46.659
about a tour of the facility.

54:46.742 --> 54:49.370
Great. I’ll get him
on the phone for you.

54:49.453 --> 54:50.871
Thank you.

54:50.955 --> 54:53.958
-Mr. Smith?
-Mr. Smith, yeah.

54:55.876 --> 54:58.045
-Marla.
-Mm-hmm?

54:58.129 --> 55:00.172
-She’s dead.
-Who?

55:00.256 --> 55:01.674
Jennifer Peterson’s dead.

55:01.757 --> 55:02.842
What?

55:04.260 --> 55:06.762
-When?
-In 1949.

55:06.846 --> 55:09.807
When she was three months
and nine days, from polio.

55:10.891 --> 55:13.477
The woman we have
isn’t Jennifer Peterson.

55:13.561 --> 55:16.522
She just stole the identity
of a dead child.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.863
[indistinct]

55:37.334 --> 55:38.753
And look at this.

55:41.505 --> 55:44.800
I found an obituary
of the dead girl
in an old newspaper.

55:46.177 --> 55:48.387
And, of course,
we have superb medical staff

55:48.471 --> 55:50.306
and facilities on site.

55:50.389 --> 55:54.143
-So, any questions?
-Actually, yes.

55:54.226 --> 55:57.646
My father has a friend
who’s a resident here.

55:57.730 --> 56:00.941
We’d love if
we could say a quick hello.
It would mean a lot.

56:01.025 --> 56:04.445
-Oh, of course.
What is the name?
-Jennifer Peterson.

56:07.073 --> 56:11.118
-Is there a problem?
-No, uh... Jennifer’s
been unwell. She’s resting.

56:11.202 --> 56:14.872
We’ll be very quick.
We promised our father.
You understand.

56:14.955 --> 56:18.542
Of course. The thing is,
Jennifer’s guardian
has stipulated

56:18.626 --> 56:21.962
that she have
only approved visitors.

56:23.589 --> 56:28.052
That’s odd.
She sounds a bit more like
a prisoner than a guest.

56:28.135 --> 56:29.553
[laughs]

56:30.221 --> 56:31.764
No. No, um...

56:32.389 --> 56:33.599
No.

56:33.682 --> 56:36.435
Um... tell you what.

56:36.519 --> 56:41.190
Why don’t I try and get
Jennifer’s guardian on the phone
and see what I can do?

56:41.273 --> 56:42.650
Of course.

56:42.733 --> 56:43.734
[sniffs]

56:45.027 --> 56:46.570
[grunting]

56:50.241 --> 56:52.910
-Hey! Hey,
what did you do to him?
-Oh, shit.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.704
-Find her! Go!
-Somebody help Mr. Rice!

56:55.788 --> 56:57.248
-Help!
-Gerry!

56:58.124 --> 56:59.375
Oh, shit!

57:00.459 --> 57:03.003
Lock it down. Lock it down.

57:03.087 --> 57:04.713
[alarm blaring]

57:05.506 --> 57:07.049
[Sam groaning]

57:07.133 --> 57:09.677
-Then who do we have?
-I don’t know.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.471
This stolen identity
is incredibly sophisticated.

57:12.555 --> 57:15.683
We’re talking about passports,
driver’s license, employment,

57:15.766 --> 57:19.186
tax records going back 40 years.

57:19.270 --> 57:22.231
They’ve scrubbed all trace
of the real Jennifer Peterson,

57:22.314 --> 57:24.358
including her death certificate.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.735
[cell phone ringing]

57:29.363 --> 57:31.699
Marla Grayson. Yeah.

57:32.700 --> 57:35.161
Fuck. I’m on my way.

57:35.244 --> 57:36.620
[alarm blaring]

57:45.254 --> 57:46.297
Madam.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.341
Madam?

57:50.176 --> 57:51.177
Chad.

57:53.637 --> 57:54.680
Thank you.

57:55.514 --> 57:57.183
Madam!

57:59.518 --> 58:01.228
Get down on the ground!

58:03.147 --> 58:04.481
[gunshots outside]

58:05.399 --> 58:07.234
-Madam?
-[toilet flushes]

58:07.318 --> 58:08.611
Hello?

58:12.615 --> 58:15.451
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

58:16.869 --> 58:18.871
About fucking time.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.569
[alarm beeps]

58:52.488 --> 58:53.822
Open the door.

58:53.906 --> 58:55.783
-You don’t wanna do this.
-Open it!

58:55.866 --> 59:00.704
Listen to me. I am prepared
to kill you to get out of here.

59:00.788 --> 59:03.082
Are you prepared to die
to stop me, hmm?

59:04.291 --> 59:06.043
[alarm blaring]

59:06.961 --> 59:09.046
I didn’t think so.

59:10.005 --> 59:11.131
[beeps]

59:11.215 --> 59:12.675
[Alexi] Thank you.

59:20.808 --> 59:22.393
Right this way, madam.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.270
-Hi.
-[Jennifer screams]

59:27.398 --> 59:29.441
-[Alexi] Get the fuck off me!
-That way.

59:33.112 --> 59:34.363
[Alexi] Fuck you.

59:34.446 --> 59:35.864
[siren wailing]

59:38.033 --> 59:40.619
-We got you. We got you.
-No, you don’t.

59:40.703 --> 59:42.496
Yeah, vacation is over.

59:50.004 --> 59:51.422
Let’s go.

59:56.927 --> 59:59.680
-[officers shouting]
-[man] Get down.

1:00:22.578 --> 1:00:24.288
What is your name?

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:31.712
Why’d you wanna kidnap
that little old lady?

1:00:34.923 --> 1:00:36.633
Wanna make your phone call?

1:00:40.512 --> 1:00:42.014
Want a doughnut?

1:00:47.436 --> 1:00:49.897
He doesn’t know it yet,
but we found him in our system.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:52.358
-He’s done time before.
-[Marla] Who is he?

1:00:52.441 --> 1:00:55.986
Alexi Ignatyev.
Brother of Nicholas Ignatyev

1:00:56.070 --> 1:00:58.947
who was once a brigadier
in the Cleveland Russian mafia.

1:00:59.031 --> 1:01:01.825
-Was?
-Hmm. Nicholas died
seven years ago in a fire,

1:01:01.909 --> 1:01:04.787
along with his boss,
Roman Lunyov.

1:01:04.870 --> 1:01:07.414
It was arson, a hit.
They’d been caught skimming.

1:01:07.498 --> 1:01:09.625
These assholes
were drug smugglers

1:01:09.708 --> 1:01:11.835
and implicated
in a bunch of murders.

1:01:11.919 --> 1:01:15.214
We thought Alexi died
in the fire too,
but here he is,

1:01:15.297 --> 1:01:17.466
trying to kidnap your ward.

1:01:17.549 --> 1:01:19.927
-Who is she anyway,
your ward?
-[Marla] Nobody.

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:21.762
She’s a retired businesswoman.

1:01:21.845 --> 1:01:24.014
-Rich?
-So-so.

1:01:24.098 --> 1:01:27.434
Well, maybe it was just
a stickup job.

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:30.145
You guys did good stopping him.
This guy’s a bad dude.

1:01:30.229 --> 1:01:34.149
Do me a favor.
Keep us in the loop
if you hear anything else.

1:01:34.233 --> 1:01:36.443
-Hmm. Sure thing, Frankie.
-[groans] Lou?

1:01:36.527 --> 1:01:39.488
-Hmm?
-Don’t call me Frankie.

1:01:39.571 --> 1:01:41.824
You used to like
being called Frankie.

1:01:41.907 --> 1:01:44.034
Yeah, not anymore.

1:01:44.118 --> 1:01:45.411
[door buzzes open]

1:01:47.287 --> 1:01:50.290
-Frankie?
-It used to be a thing
for a second.

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:51.500
I like it.

1:01:51.583 --> 1:01:52.668
-Frankie.
-No.

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:17.484
[quietly] Yeah. It’s me.

1:02:19.653 --> 1:02:20.737
I need something.

1:02:30.831 --> 1:02:32.332
Oh. Hello.

1:02:34.418 --> 1:02:37.004
Sorry. I’m just closing up.
Did you have an appointment?

1:02:43.552 --> 1:02:47.931
[anchor] Let’s go live now
to Lucille O’Mara
who is at the scene.

1:02:50.350 --> 1:02:53.812
The well-loved family doctor
was found dead
at her place of work.

1:02:53.896 --> 1:02:57.566
Dr. Karen Amos
was a highly popular
and respected doctor...

1:03:10.329 --> 1:03:13.415
Police will not yet confirm
that it was suicide.

1:03:37.773 --> 1:03:40.108
-Fran?
-Marla?

1:03:40.192 --> 1:03:42.945
-You heard about Karen.
-Yeah. Oh, my God, baby.

1:03:44.279 --> 1:03:46.490
Quick, pack a bag.

1:03:46.573 --> 1:03:48.700
We gotta go.
If they killed her,
they’re coming for us.

1:03:48.784 --> 1:03:51.537
We don’t know they killed her.
Karen may have had trouble.

1:03:51.620 --> 1:03:53.539
Oh, really?
Do you believe that?

1:03:55.082 --> 1:03:59.545
Okay, then.
Marla, I don’t want you
to get shot in the head.

1:03:59.628 --> 1:04:03.006
-I don’t wanna get shot either.
-So we don’t get shot
in the head.

1:04:03.090 --> 1:04:06.051
We went after Jennifer Peterson
because she was a cherry

1:04:06.134 --> 1:04:08.053
with no strings attached,
baby.

1:04:08.136 --> 1:04:09.596
But she’s a spider web,

1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:11.181
and we’re gonna get
trapped in it.

1:04:11.265 --> 1:04:13.517
Well, maybe, but maybe not.

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:16.520
They brought guns
into a care home.
They’re the Russian mafia.

1:04:16.603 --> 1:04:19.398
-Ex-Russian mafia.
-Marla, pack a fucking bag!

1:04:26.446 --> 1:04:27.531
[quietly] Fuck.

1:04:33.245 --> 1:04:35.372
[line ringing]

1:04:36.081 --> 1:04:38.083
Curtis, it’s Marla.

1:04:39.334 --> 1:04:40.502
Yeah, we saw.

1:04:40.586 --> 1:04:43.297
I know. I know.

1:04:44.923 --> 1:04:48.635
Yeah, you should
close the office.
Hang tight for a while, okay?

1:04:51.847 --> 1:04:54.266
Can you send me a list
of all the empty,

1:04:54.349 --> 1:04:57.102
unsold properties on our books
as soon as you can?

1:04:57.185 --> 1:05:00.314
Okay. Thanks. Goodbye.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:18.206
[whispering]
It’s gonna be okay.

1:05:46.735 --> 1:05:49.154
Jennifer,
how are you feeling?

1:05:49.237 --> 1:05:50.280
Good.

1:05:50.364 --> 1:05:52.658
Heard about Dr. Amos.

1:05:57.454 --> 1:06:02.334
-Is Alexi your son?
-What? No. That idiot?

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:05.754
But you are connected
to the Russian mafia?

1:06:07.005 --> 1:06:09.007
He’ll kill you next.

1:06:10.384 --> 1:06:13.845
I mean, that is unless
you get me out of here now.

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:17.140
Then he might let you live.

1:06:32.114 --> 1:06:34.116
Jennifer,
listen to me carefully.

1:06:36.451 --> 1:06:39.246
I don’t lose. I won’t lose.

1:06:41.748 --> 1:06:43.875
I’m never letting you go.

1:06:47.379 --> 1:06:49.715
I own you.

1:06:49.798 --> 1:06:52.884
And I will drain you
of your money, your comfort

1:06:52.968 --> 1:06:54.803
and your self-respect.

1:06:54.886 --> 1:06:56.680
Not because I want to,

1:06:56.763 --> 1:06:59.516
not because I’ll enjoy it
or because I planned for it,

1:06:59.599 --> 1:07:02.644
but because your people
didn’t play by the rules.

1:07:04.479 --> 1:07:08.191
You wanna beat me?
Well, come at me
fair and square.

1:07:08.275 --> 1:07:10.569
You get me in a courtroom.
You outplay me.

1:07:10.652 --> 1:07:12.446
You don’t bring guns
into a care home.

1:07:12.529 --> 1:07:14.823
You don’t murder
one of my friends.

1:07:22.831 --> 1:07:25.208
This is your life now,
Jennifer.

1:07:25.292 --> 1:07:29.171
You are just another
old lady in a care home,

1:07:29.254 --> 1:07:33.175
with dementia,
with incontinence,

1:07:33.258 --> 1:07:35.260
with arthritis.

1:07:37.471 --> 1:07:39.097
With no one.

1:07:40.474 --> 1:07:41.767
Except me.

1:07:48.190 --> 1:07:49.816
Jennifer,

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.360
or whoever the hell
you really are...

1:07:53.528 --> 1:07:55.614
you’re gonna die in here.

1:07:56.531 --> 1:07:59.659
Alone and in terrible pain.

1:08:03.038 --> 1:08:05.207
Hey! Let her go!

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:07.876
Come on. Come on.

1:08:09.127 --> 1:08:10.796
There you go. Let her go.
Nice and easy.

1:08:10.879 --> 1:08:13.799
[Jennifer]
Don’t. She’s the one.

1:08:25.894 --> 1:08:29.189
[judge] Good Lord.
Marla, are you okay?

1:08:29.272 --> 1:08:32.818
-Did she hurt you?
-Only superficially.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:38.323
I got lucky.
But what about next time?

1:08:38.406 --> 1:08:41.868
As you can see,
her mental health
has severely deteriorated.

1:08:41.952 --> 1:08:45.038
As this doctor’s note
describes,

1:08:45.121 --> 1:08:49.709
Miss Peterson has become
delusional, paranoid

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:51.545
and violent.

1:08:51.628 --> 1:08:53.839
She’s a danger to others
and herself.

1:08:53.922 --> 1:08:58.009
And her doctor and I recommend
that she be moved immediately

1:08:58.093 --> 1:09:00.303
to a secure psychiatric facility

1:09:00.387 --> 1:09:04.182
where her needs will be
more adequately taken care of.

1:09:05.392 --> 1:09:06.935
I agree.

1:09:59.821 --> 1:10:01.323
Don’t worry.

1:10:10.540 --> 1:10:12.751
This belong
to one of your wards?

1:10:12.834 --> 1:10:15.378
I just need
an approximate valuation,
Vee.

1:10:15.462 --> 1:10:18.757
It’s a real nice stone,
not the usual dog shit
people bring in.

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:22.510
What are we talking
retail?

1:10:22.594 --> 1:10:26.765
Mm, 175, maybe 200 grand.
It’s a nice one.

1:10:26.848 --> 1:10:29.601
You mind holding on to it,
keep it in your safe?

1:10:31.061 --> 1:10:32.604
-Is it trouble?
-Oh, no.

1:10:32.687 --> 1:10:34.773
No, I have some errands to run.

1:10:34.856 --> 1:10:36.858
I don’t want it in my purse
all day.

1:10:36.942 --> 1:10:38.068
Thanks.

1:10:39.569 --> 1:10:44.366
Fran says hello. Oh, she told me
to ask after your brother Mikey.

1:10:47.619 --> 1:10:51.039
-Mikey?
-Yeah. He still in the trade?

1:10:52.207 --> 1:10:53.917
Why? You need a fence
for this?

1:10:55.210 --> 1:10:56.544
In the future, maybe.

1:10:58.838 --> 1:11:00.966
Michael still moves stuff
here and there.

1:11:01.591 --> 1:11:03.176
Good to know.

1:11:04.719 --> 1:11:07.305
Hey, how’d it go?
Did she take the bait on Mikey?

1:11:07.389 --> 1:11:09.849
Oh, yeah.
He may be a solution.

1:11:09.933 --> 1:11:12.185
-Good.
-Hey.

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:15.146
-Did you pack
our passports?
-Passports.

1:11:15.230 --> 1:11:16.523
Fuck.

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:20.193
Shit, baby. No, I didn’t.
Didn’t you?

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:22.529
-Fuck. No.
-I’m close to the house.

1:11:22.612 --> 1:11:24.572
I can go pick them up
if you want me to.

1:11:24.656 --> 1:11:27.409
I think we should have them
just in case.

1:11:27.492 --> 1:11:29.327
-But be careful.
-Okay.

1:11:29.411 --> 1:11:32.080
-See you back at the place?
-Yeah, okay.

1:11:32.163 --> 1:11:33.748
-Okay.
-Bye.

1:11:34.541 --> 1:11:35.834
[gasps]

1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:45.760
What happened?
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1:11:45.844 --> 1:11:48.680
-I don’t know.
I think somebody...
-Oh, my God.

1:12:35.518 --> 1:12:37.145
[rattling]

1:13:25.777 --> 1:13:27.529
Hello, Marla Grayson.

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:53.847
I don’t like you.

1:13:56.099 --> 1:13:58.184
You only just met me.

1:14:07.569 --> 1:14:12.240
You know, you remind me
of someone I knew
when I was younger.

1:14:13.158 --> 1:14:15.368
She was fiery, like you.

1:14:16.119 --> 1:14:17.871
Amusing, confident.

1:14:19.455 --> 1:14:20.874
Uncooperative.

1:14:22.750 --> 1:14:24.919
I cut all her fingers off
with a bread knife.

1:14:25.003 --> 1:14:27.547
She’s buried underneath
a Jimmy John’s now.

1:14:28.590 --> 1:14:30.758
Don’t underestimate me.

1:14:30.842 --> 1:14:32.343
Who are you?

1:14:33.970 --> 1:14:35.430
A dangerous man.

1:14:37.056 --> 1:14:38.766
It says that on
your business card?

1:14:38.850 --> 1:14:41.227
You should be scared
right now.

1:14:41.311 --> 1:14:45.064
Why? Are you gonna make
another big fucking speech?

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:48.151
Ow!

1:14:52.697 --> 1:14:54.908
Ow. Jesus fucking Christ.

1:15:01.497 --> 1:15:04.292
You stole something
from me.

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:08.630
Something more than an old lady.
You know what I’m talking about.

1:15:08.713 --> 1:15:10.965
Right now
I have men searching
for what you stole.

1:15:11.049 --> 1:15:13.176
They are tearing apart
your office, your home.

1:15:13.259 --> 1:15:17.138
And if they do not find
what they’re looking for,

1:15:17.222 --> 1:15:20.433
I will tear you apart until
you tell me where they are.

1:15:28.399 --> 1:15:29.901
Do you recognize that woman?

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:33.696
That’s your mother,
isn’t it?

1:15:36.366 --> 1:15:40.286
After I destroy you,
I will destroy her.

1:15:40.370 --> 1:15:44.624
Go ahead. I don’t give a shit
about that fucking sociopath.

1:15:56.678 --> 1:15:57.887
You know, I...

1:15:59.764 --> 1:16:01.391
I don’t like being angry.

1:16:02.976 --> 1:16:04.602
I much prefer to be calm.

1:16:06.479 --> 1:16:12.068
But you... have compromised
a life I spent years
carefully building.

1:16:13.695 --> 1:16:15.488
Do you know who I am?

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.865
No, but I think I can guess.

1:16:17.949 --> 1:16:22.036
You’re either Nicholas Ignatyev
or Roman Lunyov.

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:25.748
My bet is you’re Roman,
’cause you seem more like
a boss than a soldier.

1:16:26.582 --> 1:16:30.044
So, you faked your own death

1:16:30.128 --> 1:16:33.673
and then were afraid your
Cleveland friends would use
your mother to flush you out,

1:16:33.756 --> 1:16:35.633
so you turned her
into Jennifer Peterson.

1:16:38.970 --> 1:16:40.888
I’m going to kill you now.

1:16:43.683 --> 1:16:44.684
Okay.

1:16:45.727 --> 1:16:48.396
You’re not afraid of death?

1:16:48.479 --> 1:16:50.648
Do you remember
how scary it was in 1807?

1:16:50.732 --> 1:16:54.527
-[scoffs]
-No, me neither
because I wasn’t alive yet.

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:56.571
It’ll feel the same way
when I’m dead.

1:16:56.654 --> 1:16:58.573
Not even nothing.
Why be scared of that?

1:17:00.158 --> 1:17:02.160
Anyway, you don’t need
to kill me.

1:17:02.243 --> 1:17:05.038
When you sent that lawyer
with a case full of money,

1:17:05.121 --> 1:17:07.707
your instinct was right,
I’m willing to be bought off.

1:17:07.790 --> 1:17:09.375
Your man just came in too low.

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:12.253
-Do you have a figure in mind?
-Yeah.

1:17:13.004 --> 1:17:15.006
I want $10 million.

1:17:16.883 --> 1:17:18.885
Of course you do.

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:24.223
You are... brave,
Miss Grayson.

1:17:24.307 --> 1:17:26.851
Stupid, but brave.

1:17:26.934 --> 1:17:30.229
Well, to make it
in this country,
you need to be brave.

1:17:30.313 --> 1:17:33.149
And stupid and ruthless
and focused.

1:17:33.232 --> 1:17:38.237
Because playing fair,
being scared,
that gets you nowhere.

1:17:38.321 --> 1:17:39.864
That gets you beat.

1:17:39.947 --> 1:17:43.743
You know that.
And I wanna be rich, Mr. Lunyov.

1:17:43.826 --> 1:17:49.165
I wanna be very...
fucking rich.

1:17:49.248 --> 1:17:54.837
And my bet is that $10 million,
that’s not such a big deal
for you.

1:17:54.921 --> 1:17:57.131
But for me, that’s a start.

1:17:57.215 --> 1:18:00.676
That’s enough to be able
to use money as a weapon,

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:02.929
like a bludgeon,

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:05.014
the way real rich people do.

1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:07.642
That’s what I want.

1:18:09.268 --> 1:18:12.105
-You hold no cards.
-I have your mother
and your diamonds.

1:18:12.188 --> 1:18:14.857
I’ve made sure that if I die,
you’ll never see those diamonds

1:18:14.941 --> 1:18:18.611
and it’ll be so... complicated

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:21.781
to extricate your mother
from her situation...

1:18:22.990 --> 1:18:25.910
that it’ll take years
before she sees freedom.

1:18:26.911 --> 1:18:28.913
If she even lives that long.

1:18:30.832 --> 1:18:32.250
Just pay me off.

1:18:33.626 --> 1:18:35.044
It’s the easiest way.

1:18:43.553 --> 1:18:45.096

1:30:41.186 --> 1:30:43.355
What’s that, Marla?

1:30:43.438 --> 1:30:46.942
It’s the license plate
of the car our Russian friend
was driving.

1:30:48.152 --> 1:30:50.487
Fran, say the word
and we’re gone.

1:30:51.613 --> 1:30:53.448
We start again somewhere new.

1:30:53.532 --> 1:30:54.825
Just us.

1:30:55.784 --> 1:30:56.869
And do what?

1:30:57.953 --> 1:30:58.996
Hmm?

1:31:01.039 --> 1:31:02.416
We lost everything.

1:31:04.710 --> 1:31:06.170
Not quite everything.

1:31:41.914 --> 1:31:43.916
We can take them and run.

1:31:45.417 --> 1:31:48.170
Or you can make a call
and get me the address

1:31:48.253 --> 1:31:50.422
that that license
is registered to.

1:31:52.257 --> 1:31:55.177
If we run, we’ll always be
looking over our shoulders.

You have a plan?

1:32:09.942 --> 1:32:11.109
I do.

I don’t know.

This is the address
for plate F8T 444.

[Marla] That one?

1:32:50.315 --> 1:32:52.567
-Yeah.
-He can’t live here.

1:32:52.651 --> 1:32:54.486
Maybe the plate was stolen.

1:32:54.569 --> 1:32:57.406
No, the plate definitely
matched a black Yukon.

I’m actually a little early.

You’re a John Doe.

You nearly died of an overdose.

You wanna hear
an interesting fact?

1:43:28.995 --> 1:43:31.372
When an incapacitated
John Doe is found,

1:43:31.456 --> 1:43:34.125
the state automatically
appoints them a legal guardian

1:43:34.208 --> 1:43:36.377
to oversee their treatment
and welfare.

1:43:37.545 --> 1:43:39.839
You know where
this is going, right?

1:43:49.015 --> 1:43:51.017
I’m now
your legal guardian.

1:43:57.106 --> 1:43:59.651
I got you, John Doe.

1:43:59.734 --> 1:44:02.403
I can do whatever
I want with you.

1:44:02.487 --> 1:44:06.199
Let’s find a nurse to get
that tube out of your throat

1:44:06.282 --> 1:44:10.870
so you can arrange for
$10 million to be moved
into my account.

[Marla] I know
you don’t like losing.

1:44:51.411 --> 1:44:55.873
But as your guardian,
I suggest you swallow your pride
and pay me off.

1:44:58.376 --> 1:45:04.507
You can have your mother,
your diamonds, your freedom.

1:45:04.590 --> 1:45:06.592
You’ll never see me again.

Even if I pay you off,

1:45:11.014 --> 1:45:13.641
are you not afraid
I’ll still kill you?

-I know.

kill you if this thing
continues any longer.

Okay.

1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:36.789
-Okay?
-Let’s end this now.

1:45:37.915 --> 1:45:41.252
I’ll give you the $10 million.

1:45:41.335 --> 1:45:42.795

$10 million...

we become partners,
go into business together.

Frankly, it’s scary.

it’s small potatoes.

we create a monster...

of the entire market.

80 different companies,

A real estate arm, a legal arm,
a training arm,

1:47:14.011 --> 1:47:16.430

-Exactly.
