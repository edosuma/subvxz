WEBVTT

00:04.464 --> 00:05.641
Hey.

00:05.766 --> 00:06.742
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:06.867 --> 00:08.050
The DVD's already in,

00:08.216 --> 00:09.761
and I paused it from the
last time that we watched it.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.379
Just get your ass on the couch, okay?

00:11.504 --> 00:12.937
I need to be watching
<i>Friday Night Lights</i> right now.

00:13.062 --> 00:14.065
Are you kidding me?

00:14.190 --> 00:15.849
You don't think that I haven't
been obsessing me all day?

00:16.015 --> 00:17.392
You don't think that it's killing me

00:17.517 --> 00:19.190
that I don't know if they won
the state championship?

00:19.315 --> 00:20.462
- Now before I hit play...
- Mm-hmm.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.022
Does anybody have to go
to the bathroom?

00:22.188 --> 00:24.158
No. Wait a second.
No.

00:27.101 --> 00:28.670
- Mm.
- Even this music gets me.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.398
It's like being
back on the field, right?

00:31.523 --> 00:32.988
The smell of the grass
and the sweat in your helmet...

00:33.113 --> 00:34.555
Shh, shh, shh.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.952
I never played football.

00:36.118 --> 00:37.412
Shh, shh.

00:37.578 --> 00:39.595
- Shh, shh.
- Ba... babe.

00:46.302 --> 00:47.267
You just did sleepy jerk.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.239
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah, you did.

00:48.364 --> 00:50.145
- You just did sleepy jerk.
- No, I didn't.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.060
I just watched you
come out of a sleepy jerk.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.428
I didn't...
watching it together. I'm fine.

00:53.594 --> 00:55.061
- Just go.
- All right.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.497
Wait for me.

01:07.149 --> 01:10.028

01:10.194 --> 01:18.059
*

01:25.167 --> 01:26.778
Who's ready to be empowered

01:26.903 --> 01:30.014
through the ancient fighting art
of Taekwondo?

01:30.139 --> 01:32.968
Yoo-hoo!
Master Hu.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.737
Ah, that never gets old.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.723
- It does, though.
- But not really.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.850
Wow.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.935
He is an amazing teacher.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.311
This is gonna be a hell of a show.

01:43.477 --> 01:44.245
Yeah, I think so.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.363
We can do a whole series of it

01:45.488 --> 01:46.731
where we follow you
from belt to belt.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.166
I think it's gonna be great.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.284
Master Hu, what is the belt
that will allow me

01:50.409 --> 01:52.028
to catch a fly with chopsticks?

01:52.194 --> 01:53.989
You guys, I think
you'd better check this out.

01:54.517 --> 01:55.583
Ah... ha!

01:55.909 --> 01:56.910
<i>Ah!</i>

01:57.733 --> 02:00.078
- <i>Oh, my God</i>!
- Oh, no.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.622
She stole our show.
Again.

02:02.788 --> 02:05.800
Discipline, power, inspiration.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.836
Today on <i>Shayna.</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:10.045
Oh, barf.
Come on.

02:10.211 --> 02:11.389
I used to be sad,

02:11.514 --> 02:13.991
stuck inside a thick and heavy shell.

02:14.116 --> 02:16.360
I couldn't even get out
of my bedroom door.

02:16.485 --> 02:19.306
But now there's no door
I can't walk through.

02:19.956 --> 02:22.784
Welcome to my whole new world.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.102
I'm Shayna.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.730
Don't just grow, blossom.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.073
Ugh! That Shayna steals everything.

02:29.198 --> 02:30.842
I mean, that's basically
your catch phrase.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.910
Plus she's got
a better looking Sensei.

02:33.035 --> 02:34.446
No offense, master Hu.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.532
I mean, we pried her from
that trailer like a canned ham.

02:37.698 --> 02:39.801
We helped her lose that weight,
we put her on TV,

02:39.926 --> 02:40.918
and then how does she pay us back?

02:41.043 --> 02:43.121
By leaving us for her own
competing show.

02:43.287 --> 02:46.416
And not once... not once
did that woman say thank you.

02:46.582 --> 02:48.001
I'm sure this is a coincidence.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.811
Why do you have such a blind spot

02:49.936 --> 02:51.171
when it comes to her, Ava?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.422
Because she loves me.

02:52.588 --> 02:54.699
We used to do this
cooking segment, master Hu,

02:54.824 --> 02:56.467
and she'd yell, "spice it up,"

02:56.592 --> 02:58.653
and then I'd call back, "how spicy?"

02:58.778 --> 03:00.238
Ugh, it was like watching
Venus and Serena.

03:00.363 --> 03:01.431
Oh, no, no, no.

03:01.597 --> 03:03.775
I'm putting an end to this right now.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.895
We are gonna have a little sit-down
with miss Shayna Mund.

03:07.061 --> 03:08.479
This is all so stressful.

03:08.604 --> 03:12.692
Do you do massage?

03:12.858 --> 03:14.749
Did you hear Rowan's mom
by the swings?

03:14.874 --> 03:15.920
Oh, my God.

03:16.045 --> 03:17.280
I was trying to catch your eye.

03:17.446 --> 03:20.242
She's gonna get a moped
so she can "tool around."

03:20.408 --> 03:21.259
Tool around.

03:21.384 --> 03:23.829
First of all, who gets a moped, "a"?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.497
And "b," who says, "tool around"?

03:25.663 --> 03:26.665
Yeah.
"Hi, I'm tooling around."

03:26.831 --> 03:27.791
"Have you seen me tooling?"

03:27.957 --> 03:29.626
That's so what she would do.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.001
I love it when other moms are idiots.

03:31.126 --> 03:32.203
It makes me feel so much better.

03:32.328 --> 03:33.504
I know.

03:33.629 --> 03:35.206
Oh, you're watching
<i>Friday Night Lights?</i>

03:35.331 --> 03:36.774
Uh, yeah, well,
we've watched most of it.

03:36.899 --> 03:38.176
Just haven't got to the finale yet.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.444
Me neither.
Gary came home and sacked out.

03:40.569 --> 03:41.429
Reagan did the same thing.

03:41.704 --> 03:42.931
- He was snoring.
- She was twitching.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.565
And then her head fell back
and her mouth was agape,

03:44.690 --> 03:46.517
and I was like...

03:46.642 --> 03:48.854
No, I... I want to watch it so bad.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.456
I just...

03:52.581 --> 03:53.608
They don't have to know.

03:53.774 --> 03:56.594
Laura, we can't...

03:56.719 --> 03:58.280
It's in there right now, isn't it?

04:03.059 --> 04:04.160
Let's do it.

04:04.326 --> 04:05.120
Laura, don't.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.204
What if my finger

04:06.329 --> 04:08.339
accidentally brushed
against the button?

04:08.464 --> 04:09.640
You would just be
an innocent bystander.

04:09.765 --> 04:11.001
God, your finger is so close.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.210
Laura, I... I can't.

04:12.376 --> 04:13.712
- Be cool.
- Laura, I'm married.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.214
- Be cool.
- There's a trust. My daughter.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.677
Be cool.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.436
Marriage requires...

04:22.561 --> 04:25.890
- Oops.
- Maturity.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.392
Marriage requires...

04:28.517 --> 04:30.270
You are bad.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.796
But if this is wrong,

04:31.921 --> 04:33.281
I do not want to be right.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.234
Shh.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.501
Oh, there she is.

04:37.626 --> 04:39.470
Ava and the ray-gun.

04:39.595 --> 04:40.605
Oh, my goodness.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.532
Get over here.
Put it in here right now.

04:42.698 --> 04:44.409
Get it in.
Get it in. Get it in.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.460
Bring it in.
Oh... oh my goodness.

04:46.585 --> 04:48.579
Oh, I miss those little booties.

04:48.704 --> 04:50.081
Oh, I love you girls.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.450
I love you too.
We've missed you so much.

04:52.575 --> 04:54.151
- Keep it under control.
- You know what?

04:54.276 --> 04:55.866
I ordered us
a bottle of whispering angel.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.256
- No.
- Just like old times.

04:58.422 --> 05:01.826
Oh, I've been so meaning
to get together with you girls,

05:01.951 --> 05:05.313
but as you know it is just crazy busy

05:05.438 --> 05:06.981
when you have your own talk show.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.816
It's just gnarly.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.269
Ava and Shayna together.

05:11.435 --> 05:13.897
I knew you two were friends.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.685
I used to watch you on Ava's show.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.984
Now you have your own show,
and I don't know who to watch.

05:18.534 --> 05:20.444
Oh, isn't that funny how that works?

05:20.569 --> 05:23.281
When you offer someone
an amazing contract extension,

05:23.447 --> 05:24.574
and then they stab you in the back

05:24.740 --> 05:26.050
by stealing your Sensei idea?

05:26.175 --> 05:27.952
It's amazing.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.638
Who is this mean lady?

05:30.763 --> 05:33.724
Anyway, I just want you two to know

05:33.849 --> 05:36.628
that you a true inspiration.

05:36.794 --> 05:37.837
Oh, thank you.

05:38.003 --> 05:39.631
You are my inspiration.

05:40.222 --> 05:41.758
Keep on watching and growing.

05:41.924 --> 05:46.221
Don't just grow, blossom.

05:46.729 --> 05:49.306
Oh, Reagan, I am sensing

05:49.431 --> 05:51.142
that y'all are a little steamed

05:51.784 --> 05:53.527
over the karate show?

05:53.652 --> 05:56.856
But I can assure you,
it was a total coincidence.

05:57.022 --> 05:58.149
- Uh-huh.
- Here's what happened.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.026
We were supposed to do a reunion show

06:00.192 --> 06:01.485
with all of the karate kids,

06:01.610 --> 06:03.688
and then at the last second

06:03.813 --> 06:06.491
Jaden Smith fell through.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.034
What was I supposed to do?

06:08.200 --> 06:09.593
Oh, the pinkett-smiths
are so elusive.

06:09.718 --> 06:12.831
My take, they're trying
to make too many people happy.

06:12.997 --> 06:17.001
Listen, as a peace offering
for our little Sensei screw up,

06:17.126 --> 06:20.547
could I please take you
to dinner tonight at Gjelina?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.507
You can get into Gjelina?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.176
Chris and I have been trying
to get in there for months.

06:25.342 --> 06:26.219
I can get us in.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.388
- Shut up.
- I wanna go right now.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.148
Well, I spoke to the chef,
Claudine, and she told me

06:31.273 --> 06:32.976
that she was gonna surprise us
with something...

06:33.142 --> 06:34.351
Special?
Don't say, "special."

06:34.476 --> 06:36.479
Oh, my God, if you say, "special,"
I'm gonna [Bleep] My pants.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.856
Okay, I guess I should call Chris.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.292
- Here we go.
- "Hi, mom? Can I please..."

06:41.417 --> 06:43.711
- Oh...
- Hi, honey. How are you?

06:43.836 --> 06:44.654
How's Amy?

06:44.920 --> 06:46.573
"I'm your legal property, Chris."

06:46.739 --> 06:49.075
"Please, let's make
another baby tonight."

06:49.241 --> 06:50.501
I'm gonna hold your little buttocks

06:50.626 --> 06:52.536
like two little peaches in my hands.

06:52.661 --> 06:55.256
Stop it!
Um, listen, I, um...

06:55.381 --> 06:57.425
I, uh... I won't be home till later,

06:57.550 --> 06:59.294
because I have to go to
a stupid work dinner with Ava,

06:59.602 --> 07:00.795
and she's making me,

07:00.961 --> 07:02.255
and I'll... I'll get fired
if I don't go.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.065
Okay, love you.
Miss you. Bye.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.176
Jerks. Come on.

07:06.342 --> 07:09.142
All right, why is there
no booze in my belly?

07:11.911 --> 07:13.333
{pub}Hi.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.767
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

07:14.892 --> 07:15.977
Guess what.
I did it.

07:16.143 --> 07:17.228
Huh?

07:17.394 --> 07:18.938
I finally ordered
the p90x workout system.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.039
Oh.

07:20.164 --> 07:21.508
Yeah, I'm gonna shock my metabolism

07:21.633 --> 07:24.027
using, like, muscle confusion and...

07:24.193 --> 07:25.378
Couple weeks I'm gonna shave down,

07:25.503 --> 07:26.713
get so yoked and gross.

07:26.838 --> 07:28.573
Ooh. Wonderful.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.849
How was your dinner?

07:29.974 --> 07:32.385
Oh, you know, work,
just blah, blah, blah, whatever.

07:32.510 --> 07:33.495
But I brought you this.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.437
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.562 --> 07:35.522
Mm.

07:35.647 --> 07:36.606
God, you must be so exhausted.

07:36.731 --> 07:37.957
- Let's get you to bed, huh?
- Oh, are you kidding me?

07:38.123 --> 07:40.041
I just had four cups of coffee
and a box of nerds.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.586
I am so ready to watch
<i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

07:41.752 --> 07:43.156
Let's do this.
Yeah.

07:43.281 --> 07:44.464
Well, we don't... we don't need to.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.533
Yes, we do, honey.
You've been dying to see it,

07:46.658 --> 07:47.717
and you've been waiting for me.

07:47.883 --> 07:49.102
Come on.
It's our thing. Let's go.

07:49.227 --> 07:50.637
Okay.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.938
Wait, those two are doing it?

07:52.063 --> 07:54.908
That's crazy.
I didn't know that.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.184
Shh, shh, shh.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.853
I know, I'm just... so surprising.

07:59.019 --> 07:59.796
Shh.

07:59.921 --> 08:01.214
Oh, yeah, I got it.

08:01.339 --> 08:03.608
Wait, don't... don't we
want me to pause it for you?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.068
Yes, no, definitely.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.352
I don't want to miss a second of it.

08:06.477 --> 08:07.612
- I'm just gonna...
- Okay.

08:08.713 --> 08:10.657
Hello.
Hey, Laura.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.526
Uh, yeah, tomorrow, uh...

08:13.651 --> 08:14.786
Uh, my joint, 2:15.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.563
Uh-huh.
I got Mr. balloon.

08:16.688 --> 08:18.233
Amy and I are gonna
make some cookies.

08:18.358 --> 08:22.168
I... I hope that Susan,
yeah, I hope she tools over too.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.753
I don't know.
Who does she look like?

08:23.919 --> 08:25.655
You know what?
Let me, um...

08:25.780 --> 08:26.840
Let's...
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.107
I'll have it by then.

08:28.232 --> 08:29.576
Or unless you get it, call me.

08:29.701 --> 08:30.577
Bye.

08:30.702 --> 08:32.712
- Who was that?
- Sorry, it was just Laura.

08:32.837 --> 08:34.113
She's one of the...

08:34.238 --> 08:36.448
One of the, uh, the play...
Playgroup moms.

08:36.573 --> 08:38.918
Oh, cool.
Look at how it paused.

08:39.043 --> 08:41.321
Coach Taylor looks like
a beaver, doesn't he?

08:41.446 --> 08:43.398
Like...

08:43.563 --> 08:45.491
It's, like, the only time
that dude hasn't looked hot.

08:45.616 --> 08:47.735
Yes, yes, yes.

08:47.901 --> 08:48.761
One second.
One second, babe.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.230
Imagine the odds of me pausing it...

08:50.355 --> 08:52.515
- Sorry.
- On that frame.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.301
I got it.
Hey. No, I got it.

08:55.426 --> 08:56.927
It's, uh, Jimmy Smits.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.039
Yes, Jimmy... no, from <i>Cane.</i>

09:00.164 --> 09:03.042
Yeah. Yeah, Victor Sifuentes
is tooling around.

09:05.236 --> 09:07.255
Right?
That would have been the best.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.716
He was laughing on the phone
with another woman?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.951
Yes.
With Laura.

09:12.076 --> 09:13.803
Ooh, Laura.
That is not good.

09:13.969 --> 09:15.592
- Why?
- Because all Lauras are hot.

09:15.717 --> 09:17.990
Laura Linney. Laura Dern.
Luke and Laura.

09:18.115 --> 09:19.017
Laura bush.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.435
He was just talking with her.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.687
Talking? Believe me,
you'd rather them be boning.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.264
God, I hate it
when you say, "boning."

09:24.389 --> 09:26.633
The point is
emotional cheating is the worst.

09:26.758 --> 09:29.335
I did a whole show on it with
Mr. and Mrs. Kelsey Grammers.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.987
So where is Chris right now?

09:31.153 --> 09:33.281
At the house with Laura.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.365
Mm-hmm.

09:34.531 --> 09:36.910
He started a playgroup, okay?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.911
All the kids do all these
little activities?

09:39.036 --> 09:40.446
What are these activities?

09:40.571 --> 09:44.083
Lingering glances, one hand
brushes up against another,

09:44.249 --> 09:46.961
coy laughter at inside jokes?

09:47.127 --> 09:50.223
He got a balloon guy, okay?

09:50.348 --> 09:51.716
The balloon man.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.259
The balloon man?

09:53.425 --> 09:54.636
- Those are cute.
- Mm-hmm.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.387
That is an inside joke
waiting to happen.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.932
You need to face the fact
that Chris is a gorgeous man

09:59.098 --> 10:02.802
surrounded by lonely,
desperate mom people.

10:02.927 --> 10:04.137
And if you say that you don't want

10:04.262 --> 10:05.980
to go down there and check it out,
you're lying.

10:06.547 --> 10:08.858
You, my lady friend, are way off.

10:09.024 --> 10:11.653
Okay.
There it is.

10:13.771 --> 10:15.657
There you go.
All right.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.699
Huh.

10:16.865 --> 10:18.409
She loves it.

10:18.575 --> 10:19.994
Oh, I got you there.

10:22.880 --> 10:23.740
Hi.

10:23.865 --> 10:25.849
Hi.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.502
I'm Reagan.

10:27.668 --> 10:28.711
I'm Chris' wife of seven years.

10:28.877 --> 10:29.837
It's so nice to meet you.

10:30.003 --> 10:31.731
Listen, I... I just wanted to say

10:31.856 --> 10:33.800
how happy I am that you
and Chris are friends.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.587
I mean, really, really,
you feel free to call him

10:37.712 --> 10:40.765
or text him or lunch date or spoon,

10:40.931 --> 10:42.350
get comfortable, whatever you want,

10:42.516 --> 10:43.292
because I'm cool with it.

10:43.417 --> 10:45.144
I'm so super down...

10:45.310 --> 10:46.312
With whatever.

10:46.478 --> 10:47.689
Seriously.
So...

10:48.339 --> 10:50.024
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.567
Hey, look, mama's here.

10:51.733 --> 10:52.652
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.121
Hi.
Hi, baby.

10:55.246 --> 10:56.723
And little baby boy.
Hey.

10:56.848 --> 10:57.757
Hi.
Oh, hey.

10:57.882 --> 11:00.285
Hey.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.121
Hi.
Honey, great news.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.664
Guess who's getting
along really well.

11:04.830 --> 11:05.832
Me and Laura.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.501
- Oh.
- Uh, wait. I'm Charlotte.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.753
Yeah, no, babe,
this is Laura right here.

11:10.919 --> 11:11.704
Hi.

11:11.829 --> 11:13.639
Oh. You're Laura.

11:13.764 --> 11:16.259
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.635
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.

11:17.801 --> 11:18.995
I thought that that was...

11:19.120 --> 11:22.140
I mean, it doesn't matter.
Oh, God, it's so nice to meet...

11:22.306 --> 11:23.333
Hi.
It's so nice to meet you.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.101
Hi.
Good to meet you too.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.436
We should go out sometime.

11:26.602 --> 11:27.470
Definitely.

11:27.595 --> 11:29.122
I mean, Chris and me
and you and your...

11:29.247 --> 11:30.857
And your significant other.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.233
I mean, I don't want
to assume anything.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.860
How about a barbecue tonight?

11:34.026 --> 11:34.944
- Is that crazy?
- That's a great idea, honey.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.237
Sounds like fun.
I'm free.

11:36.403 --> 11:37.238
You're not invited.

11:37.404 --> 11:39.999
So, I mean, I know it's
kind of late notice right now,

11:40.124 --> 11:41.242
but we would be so happy to have you.

11:41.408 --> 11:42.410
Oh, no, I would love it.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.619
You know what we're gonna serve.

11:43.785 --> 11:46.039
Do not say, "veggie pouch,"
'cause I will punch you.

11:47.114 --> 11:48.524
Veggie pouch.

11:48.649 --> 11:51.244
That's funny, 'cause it's...

11:51.369 --> 11:52.903
It's vegetables.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.133
Shayna did it again!

11:57.299 --> 11:59.502
She copied today's show idea.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.721
There's a Latin band and dancers.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.724
She stole our whole salsa show.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.767
What?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.144
Shayna "shole" our "stalsa"...

12:08.310 --> 12:10.213
Uh, Shayna "shole" our "stalsa" sh...

12:10.338 --> 12:12.940
Shayna "shold" sta...

12:13.106 --> 12:14.317
Ugh!

12:17.611 --> 12:18.404
Hey.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.157
She screwed us, Reagan.
She did it again.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.159
How did she know
what show we were doing?

12:23.325 --> 12:24.143
I don't understand.

12:24.268 --> 12:25.445
Well, when you were in the bathroom

12:25.570 --> 12:26.496
I told her everything we were doing.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.955
I was gone for two minutes.

12:28.121 --> 12:29.682
Well, she was asking
penetrating questions

12:29.807 --> 12:31.150
in a disarming, non-invasive way.

12:31.275 --> 12:32.335
She's really good.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.170
She learned it from me.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.589
Plus I was half in the bag
from that whispering angel.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.549
She fooled me too.

12:38.715 --> 12:41.093
Look at us.
We were so good together.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.929
I was with her every step of the way.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.472
I took her from a tadpole to a swan.

12:44.638 --> 12:45.665
Yeah, that's not...
That doesn't happen.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.141
And then she left me.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.302
You know, I know it's not
politically correct to say this,

12:49.427 --> 12:52.004
but I thought she was nicer
when she had biscuit legs.

12:52.129 --> 12:53.940
You know what?

12:54.106 --> 12:56.225
We have not done one cooking segment

12:56.350 --> 12:57.568
since Shayna left our show.

12:57.734 --> 13:00.029
Yeah, I think it's about time
we did a new one.

13:00.195 --> 13:02.381
We just need to do our thing.

13:02.506 --> 13:03.866
We are moving on.

13:04.032 --> 13:04.909
Yes, we are.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.744
Excuse me for one second.

13:12.183 --> 13:14.669
Oh.
Hey, Reagan.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.613
Uh-oh. Is this about that salsa show?

13:17.738 --> 13:20.925
Gosh, I just do not know
how this keeps happening.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.002
What is wrong with you, Shayna?

13:23.127 --> 13:25.304
We have done so much for you,
and this is how you treat us?

13:25.470 --> 13:27.290
You know how you sound
to me right now?

13:27.415 --> 13:30.143
Bossy, bossy, bossy,
blah, blah, blah, jealous.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.878
Well, you know how you sound
to me right now?

13:32.003 --> 13:33.262
Thief, backstabber, backstabber,

13:33.387 --> 13:34.856
lipo, lipo, lipo, lipo, bumpkin.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.048
That's cute.

13:36.173 --> 13:38.518
Okay, so you forklifted me
off of my Murphy bed

13:38.643 --> 13:39.585
three years ago.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.362
When do I get to stop thanking you?

13:41.528 --> 13:43.823
When you stop stealing from us.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.324
I get it.
You're jealous.

13:45.490 --> 13:46.425
- Oh...
- I mean, look at me.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.294
- Brother.
- I'm hot as hell, right?

13:48.419 --> 13:50.162
I'm thin, my ass is high and tight,

13:50.287 --> 13:52.365
and I am in control.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.432
You know what?

13:53.557 --> 13:55.434
I spent too many years being a loser,

13:55.559 --> 13:57.753
and now I am in it to win it.

13:57.919 --> 13:58.938
I mean, it's a tough business.

13:59.063 --> 14:00.106
We all know that.

14:00.231 --> 14:01.966
But Ava thought of you
as a friend, Shayna,

14:02.132 --> 14:03.634
someone that she really cared about.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.219
And you broke her heart.

14:09.806 --> 14:11.476
{pub}Laura, do you want anymore guacamole?

14:11.642 --> 14:14.145
Oh, I could <i>live</i>
<i>on guacamole.</i>

14:14.311 --> 14:15.021
I know.

14:17.564 --> 14:18.690
Sorry, it's just this stupid thing

14:18.815 --> 14:19.958
that Mossen's mom's always saying.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.126
Oh, Mossen's mom can suck it.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.528
God.

14:22.694 --> 14:24.947
Oh.
Oh, my God.

14:25.113 --> 14:26.449
Honey, remember the other day

14:26.615 --> 14:28.633
when I... I took a sip of that coffee

14:28.758 --> 14:30.536
and the sharpie got on my nose

14:30.702 --> 14:33.331
and it totally looked like a...
You know? Remember?

14:33.497 --> 14:34.305
Remember?

14:34.430 --> 14:36.508
- No.
- You do.

14:36.633 --> 14:37.668
You do.

14:37.834 --> 14:41.130
Because, remember,
we were at star... bucks.

14:41.296 --> 14:42.548
Starbucks.

14:42.714 --> 14:43.841
Oh, right, yes.

14:44.007 --> 14:46.511
We're always finishing
each other's sentences.

14:47.110 --> 14:49.055
- Babe, are you, um...
- Okay? Yeah.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.807
- Well, you just seem, like, a little...
- Weird? See?

14:51.973 --> 14:53.601
It's just like...

14:53.767 --> 14:55.393
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.

14:55.518 --> 14:56.928
We've got to give the sitter a ride,

14:57.053 --> 14:59.357
and we're about to start <i>The Wire,</i>
'cause we finished <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

14:59.727 --> 15:01.526
How much do you love that show?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.110
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sad it's over.

15:03.276 --> 15:04.695
Last night when I watched the finale,

15:04.861 --> 15:06.989
I'm telling you,
I cried more at that finale

15:07.155 --> 15:08.199
than I did at our wedding day.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.367
Oh, good.
You got to see the finale.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.702
I'm so glad, because when
Chris and I were watching it,

15:11.868 --> 15:15.170
it was like... wow.

15:15.622 --> 15:16.874
- What?
- What?

15:17.040 --> 15:17.875
- That's a funny...
- Wait a minute.

15:18.041 --> 15:21.254
Chris and I, we watched it
together last night.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.255
You had already seen it?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.506
Had I already seen it?

15:23.672 --> 15:26.357
Oh, um...

15:26.482 --> 15:28.469
Uh, boy, I don't even
remember the time.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.471
I guess I... if I go back...

15:30.637 --> 15:34.399
I watched it earlier in the day
with my friend Laura,

15:34.524 --> 15:39.270
and then I guess
I re-enjoyed it with you, yeah.

15:39.395 --> 15:41.399
-

15:41.565 --> 15:43.067
this is awkward.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.402
It's my fault.
I made him watch it.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.112
No, it's okay.
It's really okay.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.812
He just watched our show
with somebody else

15:47.937 --> 15:49.407
and then completely faked it with me.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.782
You've been coming home
late every night,

15:50.907 --> 15:52.684
and then you're falling asleep
in the first five minutes.

15:52.809 --> 15:55.186
- How important could it be?
- Important enough for me to leave

15:55.311 --> 15:58.189
an impossibly amazing dinner
with Ava at Gjelina

15:58.314 --> 16:00.350
so that I could rush home
to watch it with you.

16:00.475 --> 16:01.993
Okay, fine.

16:02.118 --> 16:03.461
Wait a second.
What?

16:03.586 --> 16:06.173
You said that you were
at this boring work thing,

16:06.339 --> 16:08.593
and that Ava was making you stay.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.034
You lied to me?

16:10.159 --> 16:12.638
I lied? I lied?
You lied. You lied.

16:12.804 --> 16:15.057
And I brought you
a really good piece of steak.

16:15.223 --> 16:16.641
Yeah, well, I didn't want
your meat swan.

16:16.766 --> 16:18.060
- Gary, we should probably go.
- Yeah.

16:18.226 --> 16:19.312
No.
No, Gary, stay.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.772
Because Gary and I are
gonna watch some TV. Yep.

16:22.505 --> 16:24.449
And we're gonna ooh and aw
at all the twists and turns,

16:24.574 --> 16:26.611
and then we're gonna
laugh about it all night long.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.362
This is a sad scenario.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.156
Look... oh, perfect.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.490
Look who it is.
It's your little friend Ava.

16:32.615 --> 16:34.559
Maybe you guys want to be
out all night partying.

16:34.684 --> 16:36.244
Hey, Ava.
Oh, really?

16:36.369 --> 16:37.579
That really funny thing
I said earlier?

16:38.955 --> 16:41.633
So, Fabiano,
what are we cooking today?

16:41.758 --> 16:44.335
Well, we'll be making fresh Focaccia

16:44.460 --> 16:47.438
with finely-shaved Capicola.

16:47.563 --> 16:50.008
- Ooh.
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:50.133 --> 16:53.804
Who wants to spice it up?

16:53.970 --> 16:55.389
How spicy?

16:55.555 --> 16:56.515
Whoo!

16:56.773 --> 17:00.728
Wow, ladies and gentlemen,
I bet you remember this face.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.688
What a surprise, miss Shayna Mund.

17:02.854 --> 17:03.981
Wow.

17:04.146 --> 17:05.323
Hey, who's in the mood

17:05.448 --> 17:08.986
for some fat-free banana pudding?

17:09.152 --> 17:10.944
Shayna, we've kind of moved on

17:11.069 --> 17:12.906
from fat-free banana pudding.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.898
Okay, well, I understand completely.

17:15.023 --> 17:16.334
You know, I just wanted to come by

17:16.459 --> 17:19.503
because, well, I miss this place,

17:19.628 --> 17:22.589
and, you know, if it wasn't
for this little lady right here,

17:22.714 --> 17:24.709
I'd still be living
in Dogpatch, Oklahoma

17:24.834 --> 17:26.002
with my rescue birds.

17:26.669 --> 17:28.422
- Shayna.
- Yeah. You rescued me.

17:29.088 --> 17:29.965
You did.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.383
You enabled me to spread my wings,

17:32.508 --> 17:35.119
and I just wanted
to say thank you, Ava.

17:35.244 --> 17:36.555
And thank you.

17:36.721 --> 17:38.723
You're welcome.

17:38.848 --> 17:41.352
Shayna Mund, everyone.

17:41.518 --> 17:42.395
Thank you.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.528
A toast.

17:43.653 --> 17:44.980
Ooh.
Now we're talking.

17:45.146 --> 17:46.648
That's very expensive.
It's for deglazing.

17:46.773 --> 17:47.733
Can it, Fonzie.

17:47.899 --> 17:50.361
Don't just grow.
Blossom.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.448
Oh.
Keep watching and growing.

17:54.614 --> 17:56.774
Hear, hear.

17:56.899 --> 17:57.775
Oh, that's good stuff.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.829
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

18:01.954 --> 18:04.333
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:04.499 --> 18:05.883
Brought you some banana pudding

18:06.008 --> 18:06.968
from the show earlier.

18:07.093 --> 18:07.969
Oh.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.754
You do watch my show, right?

18:09.879 --> 18:11.022
- <i>The Ava Show?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

18:11.147 --> 18:12.190
Yeah, the one with the...

18:12.315 --> 18:14.343
With all the women sitting around,

18:14.509 --> 18:15.860
getting into ladies' issues, and...

18:15.985 --> 18:19.348
Honey, I'm so sorry
that I lied about the dinner.

18:19.514 --> 18:21.434
Babe, I'm sorry that I lied about
watching that show with Laura.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.352
It's just, you know, you and I
watch our shows together,

18:24.477 --> 18:28.356
and, you know, and goof around
and have inside jokes,

18:28.481 --> 18:31.652
and I know it sounds
like little things, but...

18:31.818 --> 18:33.195
No.
No, they're not.

18:33.361 --> 18:35.156
I just... I need to know
that I'm your best friend.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.828
- You are, babe.
- Am I?

18:36.953 --> 18:38.549
- Of course.
- 'Cause I don't know anything

18:38.674 --> 18:42.246
about "veggie packs"
or "tooling around" or...

18:42.412 --> 18:43.471
I mean, I get it now,

18:43.596 --> 18:46.391
'cause, like,
mopeds are douchey, and...

18:46.666 --> 18:48.059
It's... it's hard.

18:48.184 --> 18:49.927
And, you know, we're just...
We're both so busy,

18:50.052 --> 18:51.662
but we have to keep working at it,

18:51.787 --> 18:54.031
and we need our things.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.761
Yeah.
You want to start another show?

18:56.927 --> 19:00.671
Or...
We could do new things.

19:00.796 --> 19:03.934
Mm.
What kind of new things?

19:04.100 --> 19:04.909
I don't know.

19:05.034 --> 19:06.611
Maybe we can toss
a football around, or...

19:06.736 --> 19:09.356
Oh. Oh. Okay.

19:09.789 --> 19:11.150
Oh, my God.
Were you thinking that we...

19:11.316 --> 19:13.084
- Yes. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.209 --> 19:14.502
Oh, oh, sorry.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.448
This is why I never hooked up in high school.
I never saw the signals.

19:17.614 --> 19:18.356
Let's go have the sex.

19:18.481 --> 19:19.340
Oh, my gosh, yes.

19:19.465 --> 19:21.509
Totally.

19:21.785 --> 19:25.229
Your catching is not
your forte, but you're into it.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.931
Uh...

19:27.056 --> 19:28.833
And then throw.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.803
Pose, then release.

19:31.928 --> 19:34.105
God, you do throw so well for a girl.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.441
I am a girl.
What's your excuse?

19:36.716 --> 19:37.802
You want to see how a man throws?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.303
Yeah, I been waiting to see it.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.554
Great. Go deep.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.896
Go long.
I'm gonna throw you the ball.

19:42.021 --> 19:43.981
Okay.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.817
Keep going.
Babe, keep going.

19:46.101 --> 19:46.894
Okay.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.438
Deep.

19:49.604 --> 19:50.981
Deep deep.

19:51.147 --> 19:52.240
Everything you got.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.818
I'm gonna empty the tank on this one.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.112
This arm is crazy.
It's a Cannon.

19:57.278 --> 19:59.046
Yeah, I can't
throw it that far, so...

19:59.322 --> 20:02.117
Oh, man.

20:05.211 --> 20:08.222
Yo, chump, see you at home.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.374
Are those... those are keys?

20:10.499 --> 20:12.211
No.

20:16.796 --> 20:19.343

<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

20:23.829 --> 20:25.284
{pub}I just want you to know, Gary,

20:27.058 --> 20:29.850
um, no harm, no foul on my part.

20:30.441 --> 20:32.736
I hope I didn't make you
feel uncomfortable

20:32.861 --> 20:35.432
with the whole watching the show thing,
'cause it was just...

20:35.945 --> 20:37.882
Laura's a great... great gal,

20:39.057 --> 20:41.104
and I would never, you know...

20:41.229 --> 20:42.572
I mean, she's...

20:42.697 --> 20:43.940
Not never, sure, I mean,

20:44.065 --> 20:45.625
if it... last two people,

20:45.750 --> 20:47.621
she's... she's a good looking gal.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.195
And I'm not... she's not my cup of...

20:49.320 --> 20:51.114
Or she would...
She could be my cup of tea,

20:51.239 --> 20:52.449
and I'm not saying she is.

20:52.574 --> 20:54.461
And I'm saying that
you and I are a couple of...

20:54.627 --> 20:56.797
Probably shouldn't
talk about it anymore, really.

20:56.963 --> 20:57.964
You got it.

20:58.483 --> 21:01.248
Reach for the wine.
I hear that.
