Relax.

02:56.912 --> 02:59.784
I'm relaxed.
What makes you think
I'm not relaxed?

02:59.819 --> 03:01.013
I'm relaxed.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.152
Uh... is it meant to do that?

03:08.187 --> 03:12.057
Isn't it supposed to, you know,
hold my body weight?

03:16.695 --> 03:18.363
Yeah, you're relaxed.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.033
I can see that.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.176
See, you have to press here,
and then it comes off.

03:24.211 --> 03:26.003
Yeah, but I didn't press
any button.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.643
-It just came off on its own.
-We'll be fine.

03:28.678 --> 03:31.013
-<i> Commander Wagner.</i>

I'm reading 150 meters here.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.828
They're way too fast
for their position.

03:48.863 --> 03:52.835
-Wagner, we got you at 150.

03:52.871 --> 03:56.910
<i> 350 or 150, the station</i>

The station is about
90 meters away.

-I'm switching to manual mode.
-<i> Negative!</i>
<i>Flying manually is prohibited!</i>

04:26.903 --> 04:28.672
The thing they told us
never to touch, brilliant.

04:28.707 --> 04:31.211

get hit by the sails.

04:31.246 --> 04:33.642

04:36.580 --> 04:38.848

Hannah, Hannah, watch out!

04:38.884 --> 04:40.246
Ah!

-That was close.
-Yeah, too close.

-<i> Rate 2.2. 2.1.</i>

05:19.689 --> 05:21.759
Wagner, your rate
is still too high.

05:21.795 --> 05:23.130
Yes.

05:23.165 --> 05:24.829
You better tell everyone
to hold on.

06:27.289 --> 06:28.620
See?

06:31.164 --> 06:32.329
What the fuck was that?

06:32.364 --> 06:34.000
Navicon was completely off.

06:34.036 --> 06:35.664
But it was not our fault?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.336
Nibra cannot blame us for that,
right?

06:37.371 --> 06:39.099
The station's readings
were right.

06:39.708 --> 06:40.738
Good.

06:44.407 --> 06:45.446
Wait a second.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.682
Wait.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.088
She's a soldier.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.820
Why would Nibra send a soldier?

07:04.494 --> 07:09.295
Welcome to the Rubikon.
Commander Wagner. Dr. Abbot,
glad to have you on board.

07:09.330 --> 07:12.198
What just happened,
Commander Jenson?
Can you explain?

07:13.707 --> 07:16.239
The error must have happened
on ground control's end.

07:16.275 --> 07:20.107
Navicon somehow lost
the connection to your shuttle
without a notification.

07:20.949 --> 07:21.977
Do you know why?

07:23.780 --> 07:26.914
Tracy will look into it
immediately.

07:26.949 --> 07:29.017
And bring me the report
once you're done.

07:33.324 --> 07:34.528
The crew cabins?

07:35.193 --> 07:36.222
Yes. Um...

07:37.196 --> 07:38.763
Follow me, please.

07:45.539 --> 07:47.641
I hope you'll be satisfied
with your cabin.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.676
It's not much,
but you've got the biggest one
we've got.

07:50.712 --> 07:53.336
Oh, no, please...
that's really not necessary.

07:53.371 --> 07:55.414
I hope
your dad's okay about that.

07:55.449 --> 07:57.749
Why?
Did he ask about or...

09:36.815 --> 09:39.953
-To the new crew,

09:39.989 --> 09:44.381
may you and the three others
arriving on Friday
have a good time...

09:44.416 --> 09:46.627
and a productive work
experience together.

09:47.525 --> 09:49.729
-Hmm...

09:57.329 --> 10:00.498
So I...
I-- I hear you're a chemist?

10:00.533 --> 10:03.008
Yes, but I've read
all of your reports
and uh...

10:03.043 --> 10:06.246
Sure, that's all
you need to conduct
complex gene modification.

10:06.281 --> 10:10.042
I am sure you will do great.

10:10.078 --> 10:13.053
As long as you
can follow orders.

10:13.088 --> 10:15.548
My words exactly.

10:15.583 --> 10:19.451
Commander, I heard
about your excellent
navigational skills.

10:19.487 --> 10:23.626
Thank you.
And I heard a lot
about you too, Doctor.

10:23.661 --> 10:25.162
Hopefully only good things.

10:25.197 --> 10:26.263
Yeah.

10:28.831 --> 10:30.495
Commander, it's the laser comm.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.632
Please, enjoy the party,
it's still my shift.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.779
How about we play one last game?

10:42.814 --> 10:45.382
Let's show the new ones
how it's done.

10:45.417 --> 10:46.687
Come on, new ones!

10:51.322 --> 10:52.554
Sure.

10:52.590 --> 10:53.589
What are the stakes?

10:53.624 --> 10:54.928
Debit-points.

10:54.963 --> 10:56.026
Okay.

11:06.471 --> 11:08.632
-Danilo!
-Uh-huh?

11:08.667 --> 11:11.208
Can you give commander Wagner
a piece of cake, please?

11:11.244 --> 11:12.843
Thank you.

11:12.879 --> 11:17.045
Sorry, commander,
my son takes this whole...

11:17.080 --> 11:19.610
being called off thing
a bit personally.

11:20.882 --> 11:22.546
And what about you?

11:22.581 --> 11:25.653
I just want to see
what type of game you play.

11:25.688 --> 11:27.626
Whoo, I got seven.

11:27.661 --> 11:30.096
I'll take one...
No, make it two.

11:31.826 --> 11:34.793
Up to your liking?

11:34.829 --> 11:38.929
They are probably used
to different standards
in the air-domes, right?

11:38.965 --> 11:42.808
Well, if you want
your essential amino acids
and minerals covered,

11:42.844 --> 11:45.971
that's all you get, I'm afraid.
Sorry, domer-boy.

11:46.007 --> 11:47.407
Hey, what's your problem?

11:48.808 --> 11:50.540
Nothing.

11:50.575 --> 11:52.410
I just wonder what makes
an executive's son

11:52.445 --> 11:54.686
-want to come to a place
like this.
-Danilo!

11:54.721 --> 11:56.251
Do you think I chose
to come here?

11:57.249 --> 11:58.985
To this old piece of junk?

11:59.020 --> 12:01.152
So then, daddy is punishing you?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.987
-Why?

12:03.022 --> 12:04.628
Did you misbehave?

12:04.664 --> 12:06.767
-Is that my piece?

12:08.136 --> 12:09.363
Thank you.

12:12.707 --> 12:14.731
-Commander Wagner.

12:15.771 --> 12:16.810
A word, please.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.716
What is that?

12:23.751 --> 12:25.583
It's our new flight route
for tomorrow.

12:25.618 --> 12:27.747
What, why did they change it?

12:27.782 --> 12:30.487
There is a strange fog cluster
in the northern hemisphere.

12:30.522 --> 12:34.150
-Nobody knows what it is.
Over Östgrunden territory.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.222
Wait, Östgrunden?

12:36.257 --> 12:38.326
Yes,
and there have been fatalities.

12:39.191 --> 12:41.395
What? What happened?

12:42.337 --> 12:44.197
They can't tell yet.

12:44.233 --> 12:45.867
Isn't Östgrunden
where they arrested

12:45.902 --> 12:47.630
those green fighters activists?

12:47.665 --> 12:49.766
Were they the victims,
the green fighters?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.703
There were a few hundred.

12:59.219 --> 13:02.521
But they said they can
circumnavigate you around it,
right?

13:02.556 --> 13:04.189
It'll take us half a day longer.

13:05.025 --> 13:09.623
Okay. Looks good. So...
tomorrow evening as planned.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.688
Okay.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.112
Come on, give me something.

13:31.086 --> 13:33.920
You know,
we're not really supposed
to be in here, right?

13:37.087 --> 13:38.822
I can't find anything
on the Internet,

13:38.858 --> 13:40.492
there's nothing
on the cameras...

13:40.528 --> 13:41.961
so I thought I'd try this.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.832
So... that's it?

13:45.868 --> 13:49.865
This atmosphere analyzing thing
that never worked?

13:49.900 --> 13:51.399
I can't even get it to budge.

13:52.974 --> 13:56.001
You could have asked me,
I'm in contact with Nibra.

13:56.036 --> 14:00.238
Right,
as if I believe a single word
a government company says.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.109
Come on, they're not the enemy.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.840
Uh, yes, actually.
Yes, they are.

14:05.115 --> 14:06.986
Of course,
not if you work for them.

14:11.023 --> 14:12.992
You worry
for your friends, huh?

14:24.701 --> 14:25.730
You're good.

14:43.422 --> 14:46.920
All systems are online
and ground control
gave their final go.

14:46.956 --> 14:47.920
You guys are ready?

14:47.955 --> 14:48.995
Yes we are.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.063
And the samples?

14:52.633 --> 14:54.759
-Dad, the samples.
-Mmm?

14:55.701 --> 14:56.728
Oh, yeah, of course.

15:00.001 --> 15:03.499
And these mother cultures
will endure the extended
flight time, right?

15:03.534 --> 15:05.970
-Of course.
-Of course, yes.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.046
Yeah...

15:08.913 --> 15:10.742
That's our slot. Let's go.

15:12.277 --> 15:13.316
Commander Wagner.

15:14.489 --> 15:15.813
-Jensen!

16:12.203 --> 16:15.048
The son is on the way now
with the mother cultures,

16:15.083 --> 16:18.611
but I'm pretty sure
they've been manipulated
as well.

16:18.646 --> 16:22.345
<i> Well,</i>
<i>there's been a change of plans.</i>

16:22.380 --> 16:25.787
<i>The committee decided</i>
<i>that we want to move</i>
<i>on to IKARUS sooner.</i>

16:25.823 --> 16:28.586
Already, when?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.760
<i>Apparently</i>
<i>in the next few days.</i>

16:30.796 --> 16:34.694
What? But I haven't been able
to investigate on the algaes
breathing cycle.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.936
<i>Then you have to search faster</i>
<i>to make it on time.</i>

16:36.971 --> 16:39.705
If he finds out,
he might destroy samples.

16:39.741 --> 16:41.602
<i>Prepare IKARUS unnoticed then.</i>

16:43.170 --> 16:47.773
Look, the station seems
more interwoven with the algae
than anticipated.

16:49.247 --> 16:51.046
It could be
more complicated to just...

16:51.081 --> 16:52.976
<i>Wagner, just prepare IKARUS.</i>

17:58.249 --> 17:59.911
Hope you know
that some of them

17:59.946 --> 18:02.548
were just exposed to high levels
of cosmic radiation.

18:02.583 --> 18:05.249
I got instructed
on them very thoroughly.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.652
Oh, good, good.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.130
So you are aware
of what might happen

18:10.165 --> 18:14.096
when untrained personnel
enters without supervision?

18:14.132 --> 18:16.059
-Don't worry about me.
-Hmm.

18:21.741 --> 18:23.770
Sounds urgent.

18:29.751 --> 18:31.212
Have they already landed?

18:31.247 --> 18:32.779
No, they're still in transit.

18:34.319 --> 18:36.648
Rubikon to Vesta 2,
what's your request?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.148
<i> Rubikon!</i>
<i>You can hear us?</i>

18:39.184 --> 18:42.094
<i>We-We're running blind here!</i>
<i>We can't get contact.</i>

18:42.130 --> 18:43.954
<i>Neither to ground control</i>
<i>nor to anyone.</i>

18:43.990 --> 18:45.796
<i>Is the station</i>
<i>still transmitting our signal?</i>

18:45.831 --> 18:47.463
Jenson, calm down.

18:47.498 --> 18:49.532
I'll contact them
and get back to you at once.

18:52.136 --> 18:53.503
Rubikon to ground control?

18:55.436 --> 18:57.034
Ground control, do you read?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.776
Rubikon to Nibra North.

19:09.218 --> 19:10.388
Rubikon to Nibvision.

19:11.626 --> 19:12.654
What's going on?

19:13.793 --> 19:14.821
We don't know yet.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.491
Where are they?

19:18.526 --> 19:20.294
-Jenson?
<i>-Wagner, yes, tell me.</i>

19:20.329 --> 19:22.263
<i>What'd, what did they say?</i>

19:22.298 --> 19:24.929
We can't make contact either.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.339
<i>What are you kidding me?</i>
<i>That can't be true.</i>

19:27.374 --> 19:31.134
We tried all staging posts
but no one was answering.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.970
Jenson, what about Navicon?
Are you receiving that?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.614
<i>It stopped just like yours</i>
<i>in the Vesta 1.</i>

19:37.649 --> 19:41.018
Wait,
so they would have to land
without any ground AI?

19:41.053 --> 19:43.122
Wh-- Are they trained for that?

19:43.157 --> 19:44.648
I-- I mean,
we weren't trained for that.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.124
Don't-- Don't worry, they...

19:46.159 --> 19:48.122
The...
Their course is preprogrammed.

19:48.157 --> 19:49.420
Right, Commander?

19:49.455 --> 19:50.821
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.799
How much time
until they enter orbit?

19:52.834 --> 19:54.234
Fifty four minutes from now.

19:55.463 --> 19:57.536
Okay, Jenson, we're on it.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.437
We're gonna find a solution
to get your connection
to ground.

19:59.472 --> 20:02.572
-Don't worry, okay?
-<i> Hannah, hurry, please.</i>

20:06.742 --> 20:09.071
Doctor,
send an emergency signal
to all stations.

20:09.106 --> 20:11.179
Even other company stations,
I don't care.

20:11.214 --> 20:12.450
Gavin, you come with me.

20:14.452 --> 20:16.285
Maybe they aren't receiving
our signal.

20:16.321 --> 20:18.016
We have to check
the optical unit.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.122
Point seven five bar.
Check complete.

20:42.547 --> 20:44.506
<i> Dad,</i>
<i>have you reached anyone yet?</i>

20:44.542 --> 20:45.608
Negative.

20:47.550 --> 20:48.946
<i>We're about</i>
<i>to enter atmosphere.</i>

20:48.982 --> 20:52.051
Uh, good news are,
you are exactly on course.

20:52.087 --> 20:54.657
<i>Yes, but only if no parameters</i>
<i>change on the way, right?</i>

20:55.996 --> 20:58.158
Hold on there, hold on there.

20:58.194 --> 20:59.222
You'll be fine.

22:02.591 --> 22:04.122
<i> Do you see it, Hannah?</i>

22:05.895 --> 22:09.831
I'm about...
five meters away.

22:26.447 --> 22:27.918
How's she doing?

22:27.953 --> 22:29.916
Vitals okay.

22:29.952 --> 22:32.491
Heartbeat slightly increased,
but that's normal.

22:49.373 --> 22:51.367
Do we get the test signal?

22:54.578 --> 22:57.547
-Gavin?

22:57.582 --> 23:01.146
-<i> We're losing...</i>

23:05.822 --> 23:09.119
-Doctor Kry-- Jenson?
<i>-Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

23:09.154 --> 23:11.220
<i>-To anyone!</i>
-Jenson, what's going on?

23:11.256 --> 23:12.459
<i>The capsule is heating up</i>
<i>uncontrollably!</i>

23:12.494 --> 23:13.966
<i>We're going to burn up!</i>

23:14.002 --> 23:16.326
Gavin, can you hear that?

23:16.361 --> 23:18.662
<i>-The shell is about to break!</i>
-<i> Danilo!</i>

23:18.698 --> 23:20.731
-Gavin?

23:24.506 --> 23:25.670
<i> Danilo!</i>

23:25.706 --> 23:26.736
-Vesta 2!
-<i> Danilo!</i>

23:28.611 --> 23:30.483
Danilo!
Danilo, what's going on?

23:36.991 --> 23:40.990
<i> Gavin? Gavin,</i>
<i>what's going on down there?</i>

23:41.025 --> 23:42.055
<i>Jenson?</i>

24:21.067 --> 24:22.733
Come on, open up!

24:28.105 --> 24:29.300
Fuck!

24:43.387 --> 24:44.552
It wasn't our signal.

24:44.587 --> 24:46.157
Down there everything is...

24:46.192 --> 24:48.585
Hannah. The-- the crew.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.661
I know.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.669
Rubikon to ground control.

24:59.370 --> 25:01.035
Does anybody hear us?

25:05.606 --> 25:06.645
Rubikon to ground.

25:09.146 --> 25:10.176
Anyone?

26:18.651 --> 26:20.946
-<i> Jenson?</i>

26:20.981 --> 26:23.513
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

26:23.549 --> 26:25.218
<i>-To anyone!</i>
-<i> Jenson,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

26:25.254 --> 26:27.651
<i> The capsule</i>
<i>is heating up uncontrollably!</i>

26:27.686 --> 26:29.919
<i>-We're gonna burn up!</i>
-<i> Gavin,</i>
<i>can you hear that?</i>

26:29.954 --> 26:32.462
-<i> Danilo! Danilo!</i>
-<i> The shell's about</i>
<i>to break!</i>

26:32.497 --> 26:34.161
-<i> Gavin?</i>

26:39.139 --> 26:41.166
<i> Vesta 2?</i>

26:41.202 --> 26:42.939
<i> Danilo! Danilo,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

26:46.071 --> 26:49.979
Sorry, I forgot the door.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.619
It's been two days
and I haven't been able
to reach anyone.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.162
The lasers can't get through
the fog in either direction.

27:09.702 --> 27:12.505
Could it be the same
as in Östgrunden?

27:12.540 --> 27:15.067
Spreading across the globe
that quickly?

27:15.102 --> 27:17.567
No that would take months,
not days.

27:20.574 --> 27:23.573
Well, I think we would
have noticed a meteorite
or a volcano.

27:29.279 --> 27:33.086
And what if it was there before?

27:33.122 --> 27:36.487
In the atmosphere
and just not visible yet?

27:36.522 --> 27:38.761
You mean the Navicon problem
when we came up here?

27:38.797 --> 27:41.765
Nah. I've thought about that
too, but--

27:41.800 --> 27:43.601
That's why
I've been trying to understand

27:43.636 --> 27:46.865
this old atmosphere analyzer...
thing.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.173
And how's that going?

27:48.209 --> 27:50.304
Tsk... Really good.

27:50.340 --> 27:53.306
So far, I only found out that
it works without a connection.

27:54.181 --> 27:56.111
Well. Keep trying.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.728
<i> Dr. Krylow?</i>

28:10.087 --> 28:11.192
<i>Can I come in?</i>

28:16.529 --> 28:19.695
I brought you
something to eat.

28:22.574 --> 28:24.971
<i>I know you're hurting but...</i>

28:25.007 --> 28:26.779
<i>We need to talk</i>
<i>about the algae.</i>

28:28.715 --> 28:30.345
<i>Our oxy tanks</i>
<i>won't hold forever.</i>

28:30.380 --> 28:31.410
Go away.

28:35.547 --> 28:40.288
How far developed
is the gas exchange rate?

28:40.323 --> 28:44.825
-Does the breathing symbiosis
work or not?
-Go away!

28:44.861 --> 28:46.656
<i>How long can we stay up here?</i>

28:48.235 --> 28:49.200
<i>Doctor, please!</i>

28:49.236 --> 28:50.726
Go away!

30:54.128 --> 30:55.158
Gavin?

30:57.294 --> 30:59.690
Gavin can you come
and take a look at something?

31:04.336 --> 31:05.366
Gavin!

31:29.189 --> 31:32.263
Oh, fuck... Shit, shit shit!

31:32.298 --> 31:33.328
Doctor!

31:36.029 --> 31:37.332
Doctor, help me!

31:40.136 --> 31:42.898
It's an emergency!
Doctor, come!

31:46.104 --> 31:47.144
Hurry up!

31:51.979 --> 31:53.744
Doctor?
Come on!

31:56.324 --> 31:57.982
Shit! How long?

31:58.018 --> 31:59.450
He just entered.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.721
I'm trying to stop
depressurization.

32:00.757 --> 32:02.820
Just a second.

32:02.856 --> 32:07.159
Mhm, it has to empty completely
before we can fill it up again.

32:07.194 --> 32:09.166
No, that's, that's too long.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.872
What are you doing? No! No! No!

32:13.907 --> 32:15.399
I'm trying to bypass
the locking mechanism.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.471
No, no, no, no!
You'll destroy it!

32:19.513 --> 32:21.479
Look, you can kill us.

32:21.515 --> 32:22.946
All of us, trust me.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.314
Just wait it out.
Please, wait it out.

32:26.451 --> 32:27.481
Come on.

32:32.853 --> 32:33.883
Come on.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.193
Idiot!

32:38.159 --> 32:41.429
Okay, empty! Now fastest mode!

32:42.027 --> 32:43.068
Ready?

32:58.451 --> 33:01.179
-Okay, it's open.
-No, no, no, no!
The pressure is still too much!

33:01.215 --> 33:02.948
Fuck it! Come on, help me.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.728
Gavin! Gavin?

33:11.763 --> 33:13.659
Hey, can you hear me?

33:16.394 --> 33:18.160
Mouth to mouth, come on.

33:18.195 --> 33:19.236
Okay.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.906
Five, four, three, two, one.

33:36.888 --> 33:39.157
Five, four, three, two, one.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.163
Okay, again.

33:53.307 --> 33:54.865
Okay.

33:55.870 --> 33:57.571
Careful.

34:15.324 --> 34:17.586
Okay,
that's not ripped.

34:17.621 --> 34:21.232
Is he... Is he gonna be okay?

34:22.197 --> 34:24.499
Uh, I don't know. Hope so.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.533
Why the hell would he do that?

34:30.569 --> 34:33.511
-Hmm?
-Why would he do that?

34:33.547 --> 34:35.339
I don't know.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.008
Frankly, I don't care.

34:38.245 --> 34:42.585
What's wrong with you?
He just tried to kill himself
and you don't care?

34:42.621 --> 34:43.650
Excuse me?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.555
You know what? You do it.

34:51.497 --> 34:52.965
What?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.167
They didn't teach you that
at spy academy?

35:01.707 --> 35:02.735
Oh, yeah, I know.

35:04.610 --> 35:06.808
Know what?

35:06.844 --> 35:08.907
That your algae system
is much more advanced
than you want to admit?

35:08.942 --> 35:11.742
-Oh, that's a big surprise.
-Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.683
I'm gonna tell anything
to a Nibra spy? No!

35:13.719 --> 35:15.888
It's not spying.

35:15.923 --> 35:17.418
They funded it,
it belongs to them.

35:17.453 --> 35:21.952
No, it doesn't!
It doesn't belong to them.

35:23.795 --> 35:25.021
It belongs to me.

35:26.161 --> 35:27.595
It belongs to Danilo.

35:34.104 --> 35:35.933
I'm sorry about your son.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.803
Come on, you must be tired.

35:41.938 --> 35:44.612
Just go to bed,
I can take care of him.

36:35.832 --> 36:36.862
Gavin?

36:38.795 --> 36:40.899
I closed my eyes for one second.

36:52.817 --> 36:54.919
Hey Gavin?

36:54.954 --> 36:56.486
Gavin, how-- how do you feel?

37:10.831 --> 37:12.965
-Let me check your ear...
-Get off me!

37:13.001 --> 37:14.035
I...

37:14.070 --> 37:15.307
I'm sorry. I-- I--

37:16.942 --> 37:18.140
Calm down.

37:18.175 --> 37:19.705
Y-You don't understand this.

37:19.740 --> 37:21.806
-You need to lay down.
-This fog is toxic.

37:21.841 --> 37:24.248
-Okay?
-Th-These aerosols... They--

37:24.283 --> 37:26.083
-Calm down.
-They're all dead.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.845
-Okay.
-They're all dead.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.356
Nobody can survive this!
Dimitri... I...

37:32.154 --> 37:33.653
They're all dead.

37:33.688 --> 37:37.424
Look, look... Breathe, breathe.
Deep breath.

37:37.460 --> 37:39.522
I can't breathe.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.662
Everyone down there.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.432
Family? Friends?

38:16.233 --> 38:18.535
You have someone down there?

38:20.565 --> 38:22.066
My little sister.

38:25.579 --> 38:26.609
Sorry.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.950
But it doesn't matter.

38:31.985 --> 38:34.012
We'll suffocate up here anyway.

38:39.793 --> 38:41.525
We're safe here.

38:46.831 --> 38:48.425
Okay?

38:48.461 --> 38:50.961
Danilo and I...

38:50.996 --> 38:53.702
achieved a working symbiosis
with the algae.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.375
We can survive.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.973
Thank you.

39:02.278 --> 39:04.009
For telling a Nibra spy.

39:06.215 --> 39:07.947
You're welcome.

39:10.758 --> 39:11.786
Where you going?

39:16.853 --> 39:20.158
Wow, you've been busy.

39:20.193 --> 39:24.093
Even<i> if</i> the air is toxic,
there are bunkers.

39:24.128 --> 39:26.837
The lasers can't get through
the fog, but...

39:26.873 --> 39:28.402
maybe this can.

39:28.437 --> 39:30.632
I'm trying to get it to work.

39:31.876 --> 39:33.177
Is this?

39:33.213 --> 39:37.014
The old ISS radio system,
exactly.

39:37.050 --> 39:39.275
That's ancient technology.

39:39.311 --> 39:42.421
I mean,
do you really think anyone
is still using it?

39:43.450 --> 39:45.752
I'll find out.

39:45.788 --> 39:47.987
I just need to reactivate
the radio antenna.

39:49.126 --> 39:50.491
Radio antenna?

39:50.527 --> 39:53.355
I-- Well you can't do that
alone.

39:54.065 --> 39:55.093
Yeah, I know.

39:56.198 --> 39:57.359
Take a seat.

40:03.610 --> 40:08.271
<i> Look for a circuit</i>
<i>in sector... in sector B.</i>

40:09.443 --> 40:10.482
<i>Can you see it?</i>

40:11.776 --> 40:13.485
The cables are tangled.

40:15.613 --> 40:16.653
Okay, wait.

40:17.518 --> 40:20.453
I got it, affirmative.

40:20.488 --> 40:22.054
<i>Okay, so redirect it.</i>

40:24.287 --> 40:27.655
Have you seen all
this useless crap here?

40:27.691 --> 40:32.661
Ya, I've lived on the station
for eight years,
I've seen it all.

40:32.696 --> 40:36.173
That's what happens
when it's too expensive
to get rid of old parts.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.235
You just pile them up together.

40:39.244 --> 40:41.508
Your domer-friend was right.

40:41.543 --> 40:43.845
This station is a junkyard.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.151
Yeah, tell me about it.

40:54.187 --> 40:59.354
<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>astronauts were like gods.</i>

40:59.390 --> 41:04.432
Well, when you were young,
countries existed, so...

41:04.467 --> 41:06.771
<i>Okay, Doctor, it's attached.</i>

41:06.806 --> 41:07.803
Wait.

41:08.702 --> 41:10.398
Very good.
By the way,

41:10.433 --> 41:14.045
you don't have to call me
doctor all the time.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.943
<i>My real name is Dimitri.</i>

41:17.812 --> 41:20.409
I think
I'm getting a signal here.

41:22.118 --> 41:23.346
<i>Dimitri.</i>

41:26.326 --> 41:28.351
Give me a second,
let me scan it.

41:31.688 --> 41:32.729
Got it.

41:34.064 --> 41:35.094
Okay.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.568
Let's give it a try.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.913
Commander Wagner to ground.

41:58.949 --> 42:00.053
Can anybody hear me?

42:05.394 --> 42:06.422
Please, anyone?

42:11.970 --> 42:13.000
Hello?

42:15.537 --> 42:17.576
Fuck!

42:23.776 --> 42:25.012
Gavin can't be right.

42:28.384 --> 42:29.621
She can't be dead.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.429
Open the door! Come on!

43:06.488 --> 43:08.084
Your ears hurt?

43:08.120 --> 43:09.820
I-- I can give you
some painkillers

43:09.855 --> 43:11.253
for the-- for the ears.

43:11.288 --> 43:12.994
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-You're sure?

43:16.734 --> 43:19.594
So there's no doubt
about what you said?

43:24.735 --> 43:28.647
The chemical structure
of the fog's aerosols
is highly toxic.

43:29.873 --> 43:31.116
It's lethal.

43:31.151 --> 43:32.849
Where do they come from?

43:33.747 --> 43:35.412
I don't know, uh...

43:35.447 --> 43:38.450
To me it seems like
some kind of... chain reaction?

43:38.486 --> 43:39.515
From what?

43:40.489 --> 43:42.484
Permafrost gases.

43:42.519 --> 43:45.928
We've been warning people
about this for years

43:45.963 --> 43:49.460
And now
they've obviously reacted
with something.

43:49.496 --> 43:53.034
Maybe Toxins
from the power plants,
some other pollution,

43:53.069 --> 43:55.565
maybe chemical weapons
from another corporation war.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.668
Fact is it's,
it's all over down there.
We fucked it.

43:59.703 --> 44:02.280
Apparently, the economy
was more important
than breathing.

44:02.315 --> 44:04.077
And what about the air-domes?

44:04.113 --> 44:06.744
They are for a very specific
molecular spectrum.

44:06.779 --> 44:10.013
Only a closed system
with oxygen tanks
could shield them from the fog.

44:10.048 --> 44:11.918
But there are bunkers like that.

44:11.954 --> 44:14.417
Evacuation bunkers.
I trained in them.

44:14.453 --> 44:16.818
And what will happen
to the people in there? Hm?

44:16.854 --> 44:20.125
Sooner or later,
they'll run out of food,
they'll run out of oxygen.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.591
Same as us.
We're all just living corpses.

44:22.626 --> 44:24.535
-Gavin.
-And I don't like the idea
of a slow death.

44:24.570 --> 44:27.134
We can stay here
as long as we need to.

44:30.233 --> 44:32.073
The algae gas exchange works.

44:39.249 --> 44:40.280
No.

44:40.316 --> 44:41.346
Wha?

44:41.878 --> 44:42.919
No?

44:44.280 --> 44:46.382
Uh-uh, I can't live like this.

44:46.418 --> 44:50.227
Stuck in this-- in this
tiny metal can forever?

44:50.262 --> 44:51.555
Maybe you two can.

44:52.724 --> 44:56.163
-I just can't.
-Yeah and what
is your alternative?

44:57.897 --> 44:59.364
You wanna try it again?

45:03.433 --> 45:07.239
Look... it's your life,
your decision.

45:07.275 --> 45:09.907
I just want you to know
that if you try it again,

45:09.942 --> 45:11.849
you will also kill her.

45:13.943 --> 45:15.116
And me.

45:16.122 --> 45:18.817
What, why?

45:18.852 --> 45:23.158
I didn't tell you this yet,
but the system is designed
for a full crew of six.

45:23.194 --> 45:28.162
They produce CO2 and the system
converts it back into oxygen.

45:31.235 --> 45:36.368
The bare minimum
for an efficient gas exchange
is three people.

45:37.277 --> 45:40.603
Gavin, we need your CO2.

46:20.252 --> 46:21.281
Can I join?

46:25.322 --> 46:26.352
Okay.

46:35.468 --> 46:38.133
I'm mad at you, you know?

46:38.168 --> 46:43.270
For leaving me alone here
with this old grumpy cat.

46:52.878 --> 46:55.315
What? What?

46:56.589 --> 46:58.217
What?
What's so funny?

46:58.253 --> 47:02.592
It's-- It's just that
I-- I worked my ass off.

47:02.627 --> 47:05.621
Debit-point for debit-point.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.263
One shitty mission
after another and for what?

47:10.797 --> 47:11.826
For this?

47:14.764 --> 47:18.602
I could have partied more,
like Knopf, or...

47:19.910 --> 47:22.441
taken a day off
every once in a while.

47:25.118 --> 47:26.148
Yeah.

47:28.482 --> 47:33.485
I think I really screwed up
this whole life thing.

47:39.122 --> 47:41.161
Same here.

47:41.196 --> 47:43.762
You think
I was not screwing up my life,

47:43.797 --> 47:47.398
by going on protests
and not washing
and cutting out T-shirts and...

47:47.433 --> 47:49.405
I'm really glad I did that now,
aren't I?

47:49.441 --> 47:52.171
Yeah.

47:52.206 --> 47:53.912
There is no planet B.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.211
And Dimitri.

47:59.247 --> 48:01.585
Do you think
he was partying in his lab

48:01.620 --> 48:04.155
with his working symbiosis?

48:11.357 --> 48:12.796
Can you imagine
if they knew on Earth

48:12.831 --> 48:14.430
that we were the last
three humans?

48:14.465 --> 48:15.965
Oh, my God!

48:16.000 --> 48:17.694
A bunch of losers
and freaks.

48:27.370 --> 48:29.245
Me and my friends...

48:29.280 --> 48:34.480
fought so hard for a planet
that doesn't exist anymore.

48:37.582 --> 48:41.121
I have spent so long
believing in something,

48:41.156 --> 48:43.885
and now it doesn't...
mean anything.

48:46.996 --> 48:50.562
So the naïve activist is gone?

48:51.996 --> 48:53.037
Hmm...

48:54.867 --> 48:56.464
He...

48:56.499 --> 48:58.438
He was kind of an idiot anyway.

49:00.446 --> 49:01.771
That's too bad.

49:03.316 --> 49:04.642
I liked him.

49:49.418 --> 49:50.457
Dimitri?

49:55.301 --> 49:56.331
What?

49:57.063 --> 49:58.333
Is that normal?

50:03.571 --> 50:06.374
Eh, they never keep
the exact same green color.

50:07.272 --> 50:08.679
How much longer?

50:08.714 --> 50:10.912
I'm dying this time for real.

50:10.947 --> 50:13.511
Two more minutes!

50:13.547 --> 50:16.252
Yeah, but-- but brown?
That's-- that's weird.

50:17.788 --> 50:19.486
It can happen if, uh...

50:20.957 --> 50:23.323
No, don't worry, it's fine.

50:23.359 --> 50:27.021
Oh, fuck...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

50:28.361 --> 50:30.431
That's it, I'm done.

50:30.466 --> 50:32.802
They'll have to wait
for my breath until tomorrow.

50:32.837 --> 50:36.137
Gavin, it wasn't 45 minutes.

50:36.173 --> 50:38.199
Do-Do you even know
how long that is?

50:38.235 --> 50:40.511
No, of course you don't,
'cause it's always Hannah
and me peddling.

50:40.546 --> 50:44.405
Actually, I do know
because every morning
when you cuddle, I peddle.

50:44.441 --> 50:46.015
At least 45 minutes.

50:46.051 --> 50:47.781
Maybe we should check that
on the CCTV.

50:47.817 --> 50:48.917
Maybe we should.

50:48.952 --> 50:50.814
Okay, okay. What do you say?

50:51.622 --> 50:52.651
Movie night?

50:53.186 --> 50:56.160
-Sure.
-What else?

51:05.802 --> 51:08.165
Dimitri?

51:08.200 --> 51:12.605
Uh, yeah,
choose something. I'm uh...
I'll come in a second!

51:39.067 --> 51:41.400
Sorry, guys, sorry.

51:41.435 --> 51:44.234
Oh, you waited for me,
that's nice.

51:44.270 --> 51:45.575
Where have you been?

51:45.611 --> 51:46.908
I just, uh...

51:46.943 --> 51:48.639
What are we watching?

51:48.675 --> 51:51.339
Nothing, if you can't reactivate
the Internet.

51:51.374 --> 51:55.210
Apparently,
we've reached the end
of the internal movie library.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.286
Oh...

52:04.521 --> 52:06.756
I can offer you a drink.

52:06.791 --> 52:08.632
-More. More, more!

52:08.667 --> 52:10.129
More, more, more!

52:10.164 --> 52:11.628
Hannushka, it's enough.

52:11.664 --> 52:13.662
-You had enough, Hannushka.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.836
Yeah, thank you...
Daddy.

52:15.872 --> 52:20.235
-Okay...
-Of all your algae's functions
this is definitely my favorite.

52:20.270 --> 52:24.241
Yeah, well,
this batch is a bit too strong.
You can see that.

52:24.276 --> 52:27.782
If I'd known
you had a whole distillery
in your lab I would have just...

52:27.817 --> 52:31.115
Yeah, you would just report me
to Nibra, wouldn't you,
little spy?

52:31.151 --> 52:32.984
Yes, probably.

52:34.956 --> 52:36.155
Wait, what?

52:36.190 --> 52:38.054
Wait, you didn't know?

52:38.089 --> 52:42.825
Hannushka was sent by Nibra
to steal my mother cultures.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.961
What the fuck it's not--
No, not stealing.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.869
-Not stealing. Just taking away.
-Steal is a harsh word.

52:46.904 --> 52:48.663
Take it away and steal.

52:48.698 --> 52:50.172
-No. No. No.
-Wh-- Five weeks

52:50.207 --> 52:52.336
and you're only mentioning
this now?

52:52.371 --> 52:54.311
I'm so sorry, my dear.

52:55.008 --> 52:56.109
Take it.

52:56.144 --> 52:57.171
-Three.

52:58.413 --> 53:01.178
You-- You were hiding
the samples?

53:01.214 --> 53:02.484
I was helping.

53:04.081 --> 53:07.624
A few months ago,
Nibra changed their contract.

53:07.659 --> 53:12.356
Suddenly they wanted the system
to be exclusive
for their air-domes.

53:12.391 --> 53:14.255
And... I wouldn't mind.

53:14.290 --> 53:17.491
I would have taken the money,
which was a lot of money.

53:17.526 --> 53:19.937
Greedy fuck.

53:19.973 --> 53:22.804
Uh? Yeah,
and not ashamed of it.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.334
But Danilo, no.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.176
He was furious.

53:27.211 --> 53:30.170
He decided to make it
a public domain.

53:30.206 --> 53:34.414
He found some secret,
I don't know, distributor.

53:34.449 --> 53:38.451
Huh, actually sounds
like a good guy.

53:38.486 --> 53:43.492
Extremely annoying,
stubborn, rude.

53:44.654 --> 53:45.890
A little bit like you.

53:47.662 --> 53:51.533
Cheeky little do-gooder shit,
huh?

53:53.035 --> 53:54.063
Sorry.

53:56.768 --> 53:59.638
Thank you...
you know.

53:59.673 --> 54:03.506
Okay, okay, show me
what you got, boys.

54:03.542 --> 54:05.772
Ugh, yeah this is garbage.

54:05.808 --> 54:07.609
-No!
-Now you are gone.

54:07.644 --> 54:09.017
What the f--

54:09.052 --> 54:10.550
-Boom.
-No, Gavin!

54:10.585 --> 54:13.324
-Ooh...
-Fuck off, I-- No, I am--

54:13.359 --> 54:15.956
-Hannushka, Hannushka, stop it.
-No! Okay, I'm... no.

54:15.991 --> 54:21.728
No! And you two
should be so fucking ashamed
cleaning out the poor.

54:25.003 --> 54:26.933
I need to dance or I'll die.

54:26.968 --> 54:28.537
Oh, no.

54:39.985 --> 54:43.145
Gavin! Dance with the woman.

54:43.921 --> 54:45.420
Come on, dance.

54:45.455 --> 54:48.389
-Come on, lover boy.
-Please, no.

54:48.425 --> 54:51.819
-Please...
-Come... Come on.
Come on!

54:51.854 --> 54:54.497
Move the hips, move the hips.

54:54.532 --> 54:57.764
No! I think-- I think
you should get Dimitri to dance.

54:58.896 --> 55:01.035
-Oh, gotcha!
-Oh, no, no!

55:01.071 --> 55:02.569
-Come on!
-No! No,

55:02.604 --> 55:04.231
I'm a scientist,
I'm not a dancer, I'm not--

55:04.266 --> 55:06.036
-Yes you are.
-Yes, doctors can dance,
come on!

55:06.071 --> 55:07.174
You're definitely, definitely
drunk enough to dance.

55:07.209 --> 55:08.472
-Come on.
-Stop it.

55:08.507 --> 55:10.304
Come on, Dimitri. Yes.

55:12.379 --> 55:14.308
Come on. Yes.

56:32.631 --> 56:35.461
<i> If anyone else</i>
<i>is out there, please answer.</i>

56:35.496 --> 56:37.368
<i>We are a group of survivors</i>

56:37.403 --> 56:39.797
<i>in a bunker underneath</i>
<i>Nibra headquarters.</i>

56:39.833 --> 56:42.099
<i>If you can hear us,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

56:43.170 --> 56:44.899
Gavin?

56:44.934 --> 56:47.137
Gavin? Hey, you guys wake up!

56:49.708 --> 56:53.107
Hey Gavin! Gavin, wake up!

56:53.142 --> 56:55.010
Come on,
the laser comm worked again,

56:55.046 --> 56:57.282
I-- I talked to one
of the survivors.

56:57.318 --> 56:58.580
Uh--

56:58.616 --> 57:00.383
Come on! Come!

57:00.418 --> 57:02.285
Dimitri.

57:02.321 --> 57:05.291
Hey, they're alive. There's--
There are survivors down there.

57:05.327 --> 57:07.058
Yeah, good, great...

57:13.734 --> 57:16.771
Rubikon to survivors,
can you hear us?

57:20.042 --> 57:22.341
<i> Hello?</i>
<i>Commander Wagner?</i>
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

57:22.376 --> 57:24.204
Oh, God.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.250
-Um, yes. Yes, it is.
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>

57:26.285 --> 57:29.050
And we're happy
to hear your voice.

57:29.085 --> 57:32.550
<i>Uh...</i>
<i>This is Esther Chen-Kaminski,</i>
<i>I'm our representative.</i>

57:32.586 --> 57:34.382
How many of you are there?

57:35.621 --> 57:37.825
<i>We're almost 300 here.</i>

57:39.559 --> 57:41.592
Was there an attack?

57:41.627 --> 57:43.000
<i>Honestly, we don't know.</i>

57:43.035 --> 57:45.096
<i>The fog came so suddenly</i>

57:45.132 --> 57:50.133
<i>and people started coughing</i>
<i>and dropping, it was...</i>

57:50.168 --> 57:52.538
<i>But the soldiers brought us</i>
<i>into the bunker.</i>

57:52.573 --> 57:54.875
But you are safe, aren't you?

57:56.213 --> 57:57.746
<i>No, it's the oxygen.</i>

57:59.150 --> 58:01.952
<i>We don't have much left.</i>

58:01.988 --> 58:04.852
<i>But I guess Krylow's algae</i>
<i>system is preventing</i>
<i>that for you, right?</i>

58:07.687 --> 58:11.057
How do you know about the algae?

58:11.092 --> 58:14.428
<i>Well, some of us own stock</i>
<i>in this promising project.</i>

58:14.463 --> 58:16.534
So you're CEOs or something?

58:17.828 --> 58:19.735
<i>And their families, yes.</i>

58:21.373 --> 58:23.937
Is there a Randall Abbot
amongst you?

58:26.110 --> 58:28.040
<i>I'm sorry, no.</i>

58:32.315 --> 58:35.550
<i>But, so these algae...</i>

58:35.586 --> 58:37.244
<i>The system provides for you,</i>
<i>right?</i>

58:37.279 --> 58:39.348
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>Dr. Krylow made that work?</i>

59:48.093 --> 59:49.656
Dimitri?

59:49.692 --> 59:51.453
-H-He's in here.

59:52.493 --> 59:53.593
Hannah was right.

59:53.628 --> 59:55.765
There are survivors, almost 300.

59:56.869 --> 59:57.926
Really?

59:57.961 --> 59:59.700
Yeah, but even better.

59:59.735 --> 1:00:02.503
There are these openings
in the fog.

1:00:02.538 --> 1:00:04.741
Very small ones, but still.

1:00:06.843 --> 1:00:09.913
-Hmm.
-That's why they could
hear us.

1:00:09.948 --> 1:00:13.516
They've already managed
to transfer their bunker's
coordinates.

1:00:13.551 --> 1:00:14.912
The next step
would be the Vesta.

1:00:14.948 --> 1:00:17.146
With Gavin's
atmosphere analysis

1:00:17.181 --> 1:00:19.217
I might manage
to fly down manually.

1:00:19.252 --> 1:00:21.819
-To do what?
-Their bunker
provides enough oxygen

1:00:21.854 --> 1:00:23.423
for three more weeks at best.

1:00:23.458 --> 1:00:25.553
-Mm-hmm.
-If...

1:00:27.866 --> 1:00:30.932
If we could bring your algae
down there, we could help them.

1:00:33.905 --> 1:00:37.305
-Okay.
-Look, they're supposed to
nourish a closed system.

1:00:37.340 --> 1:00:40.209
It doesn't matter
if it's a bunker down there
or the Rubikon up here.

1:00:40.244 --> 1:00:45.408
Hold on one second.
So, you're suggesting
we fly down without Navicon?

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:46.849
Yes.

1:00:50.247 --> 1:00:54.050
We could save
three hundred lives.

1:00:54.086 --> 1:00:55.657
We think
it's a risk worth taking.

1:00:55.692 --> 1:00:57.718
Let's say we,
we make it to Earth.

1:00:57.753 --> 1:01:00.821
-How do we get to the bunkers?
-They have mobile oxy-tanks.

1:01:00.856 --> 1:01:03.797
They could pick us up,
also the equipment
from the Nibra Lab.

1:01:03.833 --> 1:01:06.429
It's pretty close
to where we'd land.

1:01:06.465 --> 1:01:10.402
Oh, it seems like
you've figured it all out.

1:01:10.437 --> 1:01:11.968
Great...

1:01:12.003 --> 1:01:14.976
So what if I say no?

1:01:17.083 --> 1:01:19.707
What? Wh-Why?

1:01:19.742 --> 1:01:24.287
You know,
it's-- it's a little
irresponsible.

1:01:24.322 --> 1:01:27.219
And very, very stupid.

1:01:27.255 --> 1:01:29.958
Flying down without Navicon?
Are you out of your minds?

1:01:29.993 --> 1:01:32.823
So what, we do-- we do nothing?
We just watch them die?

1:01:32.859 --> 1:01:36.292
-Are you really that selfish?
-Ca-Can you stop with this
green fighter bullshit?

1:01:36.327 --> 1:01:38.132
It's not one
of your awareness projects.

1:01:38.167 --> 1:01:40.827
We have to help if we can.
We have a moral responsibility.

1:01:40.862 --> 1:01:44.501
My only moral responsibility
is to keep you and you alive.

1:01:44.536 --> 1:01:46.703
-That's it.
-Isn't this what Danilo
would have wanted?

1:01:46.739 --> 1:01:47.704
To help people?

1:01:47.739 --> 1:01:49.905
Yes, he did.

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:50.979
And now he's dead.

1:01:53.048 --> 1:01:56.017
But I'm here and I say,
"tough luck to them."

1:01:57.622 --> 1:02:00.148
I know now how
to make mother cultures.

1:02:00.183 --> 1:02:03.085
So, we don't need your help.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.561
You're not gonna touch them.

1:02:04.596 --> 1:02:05.593
-Hey
-You understand
what I'm saying?

1:02:05.628 --> 1:02:06.857
You're not gonna<i> touch it!</i>

1:02:06.893 --> 1:02:08.898
Stop! Seriously, you guys.

1:02:09.994 --> 1:02:11.769
Sit down, both of you.

1:02:24.548 --> 1:02:25.915
We have to make a decision.

1:02:27.576 --> 1:02:30.045
It really
doesn't make sense.

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:31.947
Come on, we are fine.

1:02:31.982 --> 1:02:33.481
We are good here.

1:02:33.516 --> 1:02:36.222
We, we can stay here
as long as we want.

1:02:36.824 --> 1:02:39.688
Really? That's your plan?

1:02:39.723 --> 1:02:42.689
Have you gone completely crazy
in that lab all this time?

1:02:42.725 --> 1:02:45.592
You don't get to talk to me
about crazy, mister.

1:02:45.627 --> 1:02:47.737
I am not the one
who tried to kill himself.

1:02:47.773 --> 1:02:50.132
How desperately are you
trying to do it again?

1:02:50.167 --> 1:02:52.333
Really? You're gonna go there?

1:02:52.369 --> 1:02:54.510
Hey, I'm not done
talking to you.

1:02:54.546 --> 1:02:56.279
Hey, Hey!
Come back! Come--

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:57.342
Danilo!

1:03:11.757 --> 1:03:12.753
You okay?

1:03:13.628 --> 1:03:14.722
Nothing, it's...

1:03:19.404 --> 1:03:21.762
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

1:03:23.767 --> 1:03:28.109
It's nothing, it's just--
It's just your schnapps,
I guess.

1:03:38.016 --> 1:03:40.123
What are you doing?

1:03:40.158 --> 1:03:42.860
Just a precaution,
just want to make sure
everything is fine.

1:03:43.657 --> 1:03:44.686
Thank you.

1:03:46.123 --> 1:03:48.195
He's right, you know.

1:03:48.230 --> 1:03:50.659
What if those
are the last people
on the planet?

1:03:54.062 --> 1:03:55.971
Well.

1:03:56.007 --> 1:03:59.638
If these are the last people
on the planet Earth,

1:03:59.674 --> 1:04:04.446
maybe
it's not that bad of an idea,
to start it all from scratch.

1:04:04.481 --> 1:04:07.211
Dimitri, come on.

1:04:07.246 --> 1:04:11.985
Okay. Tell me,
what have these people,

1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:16.652
these lovely CEOs,
ever done for you?

1:04:18.255 --> 1:04:19.930
They got me out of the dirt.

1:04:20.462 --> 1:04:22.692
Hm.

1:04:22.727 --> 1:04:27.830
Yeah and made you a soldier
to serve them in their army.

1:04:27.866 --> 1:04:29.566
You done?

1:04:47.952 --> 1:04:49.083
Can't sleep?

1:04:55.225 --> 1:04:57.066
Is that her, Knopf?

1:04:58.162 --> 1:04:59.761
Her real name is Mia.

1:05:01.938 --> 1:05:05.038
This is the last message
I got from her.

1:05:05.073 --> 1:05:07.241
I'm trying to find out
where she was.

1:05:08.675 --> 1:05:10.874
Okay?

1:05:10.909 --> 1:05:14.708
Knopf was stationed
five hours away
from the Nibra central bunker.

1:05:14.743 --> 1:05:17.246
There are other bunkers
in that area and...

1:05:17.281 --> 1:05:19.847
she got an evacuation order too.

1:05:21.188 --> 1:05:23.323
That means
she could still be alive?

1:05:25.696 --> 1:05:27.360
Hannah, why didn't you tell me?

1:05:28.226 --> 1:05:31.397
'Cause it's-- it's stupid.

1:05:33.231 --> 1:05:35.302
It's such a small chance.

1:06:12.743 --> 1:06:14.471
We're preparing for departure.

1:06:14.506 --> 1:06:17.014
Will you help us load
the mother cultures?

1:06:23.217 --> 1:06:27.280
Dimitri,
either you come with us or...

1:06:27.315 --> 1:06:28.454
Or you stay.

1:06:37.735 --> 1:06:39.936
What? In here as well? Eh--

1:06:39.971 --> 1:06:43.068
No, no, don't say
we're losing them now.

1:06:43.104 --> 1:06:45.234
Is this a trick,
to make us stay?

1:06:45.269 --> 1:06:47.137
No, it's not a trick.

1:06:47.172 --> 1:06:48.639
It's really happening.

1:06:50.142 --> 1:06:51.312
In the whole station.

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:54.045
Are they sick?

1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:55.786
That's what I thought.

1:06:55.821 --> 1:06:58.079
So what?
We can't bring them down or?

1:06:58.114 --> 1:06:59.155
Dimitri.

1:07:01.188 --> 1:07:04.093
-It's you.
-I make them go...

1:07:04.129 --> 1:07:06.190
I don't even touch them
without your supervision.

1:07:06.225 --> 1:07:08.131
You don't need to touch them.

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:12.628
They feed from our urine
in the station's nutrient cycle.

1:07:12.664 --> 1:07:15.963
So they've changed color
because of Hannah's pee?

1:07:16.572 --> 1:07:17.899
Exactly.

1:07:21.504 --> 1:07:23.740
Yeah, yeah, you almost got me.

1:07:24.316 --> 1:07:25.839
Come on.

1:07:25.874 --> 1:07:29.876
The algae is extremely sensitive
to hormones.

1:07:29.911 --> 1:07:31.919
It's your high levels of HCG
that do it.

1:07:31.954 --> 1:07:34.614
No, soldiers can't get pregnant.

1:07:34.649 --> 1:07:36.256
We don't even get our periods.

1:07:36.291 --> 1:07:38.791
I'm-- I'm sterile
till the end of my duty.

1:07:38.826 --> 1:07:43.094
Unless your hormone inducer
loses connection
with its control unit

1:07:43.129 --> 1:07:44.662
for a long enough time.

1:07:55.175 --> 1:07:57.437
But the algae is fine, right?

1:07:57.472 --> 1:07:58.676
We won't lose it?

1:07:59.914 --> 1:08:01.448
The algae is fine.

1:08:02.885 --> 1:08:06.754
That, on the other hand?

1:08:06.789 --> 1:08:08.323
If we fly down...

1:08:12.731 --> 1:08:16.498
These people need our help.

1:08:16.533 --> 1:08:17.563
Come on.

1:08:19.836 --> 1:08:22.064
Wait, Hannah, wait.

1:08:22.099 --> 1:08:23.364
Stop.

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:24.498
What the fuck, dude?

1:08:24.533 --> 1:08:26.803
He's right, he's right.

1:08:27.379 --> 1:08:28.409
Please.

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:31.714
Start loading
the mother cultures.

1:08:31.749 --> 1:08:33.150
We're leaving tomorrow.

1:08:34.147 --> 1:08:35.416
I'll prepare the Vesta.

1:08:35.915 --> 1:08:36.945
Hannah.

1:08:39.424 --> 1:08:40.454
Hannah!

1:08:57.676 --> 1:09:01.244
Shit. Come on.

1:09:13.449 --> 1:09:15.290
Again?

1:09:15.326 --> 1:09:18.418
In case you didn't notice,
I-- I just killed us.

1:09:18.454 --> 1:09:20.591
So, yeah, again.

1:09:20.626 --> 1:09:22.892
Yeah, but the other eight times
you made it.

1:09:26.731 --> 1:09:28.865
You're just getting tired,
that's all.

1:09:31.738 --> 1:09:34.740
This flight corridor
you gave me is fucking narrow.

1:09:34.776 --> 1:09:37.507
Well, then they're lucky
that it's you sitting
in the seat.

1:09:44.289 --> 1:09:46.850
Hannah, I really think
we should talk about the...

1:09:48.088 --> 1:09:49.990
about all this.

1:09:50.025 --> 1:09:51.652
What does this mean now?

1:09:51.687 --> 1:09:54.055
Nothing, this means nothing.

1:09:55.897 --> 1:09:56.926
Hannah...

1:09:59.529 --> 1:10:01.737
isn't it likely that--

1:10:01.773 --> 1:10:02.837
Stop it, okay? I...

1:10:03.872 --> 1:10:05.704
No! Fuck.

1:10:07.211 --> 1:10:09.343
I'm going to lose it
at re-entry or landing

1:10:09.378 --> 1:10:11.510
or without
the station's radiation shield.

1:10:11.546 --> 1:10:13.778
Okay, that's--
that's super fucked up, yeah.

1:10:17.450 --> 1:10:19.322
Sorry,
I-- I didn't mean to--

1:10:21.524 --> 1:10:25.322
It has no chance anyway,
I mean, even if we stayed.

1:10:25.358 --> 1:10:26.989
I can't raise a baby here.

1:10:27.965 --> 1:10:30.498
Just you, me and Dimitri?

1:10:32.628 --> 1:10:34.203
This changes nothing.

1:10:34.239 --> 1:10:36.273
It just makes
the whole situation shittier.

1:10:39.842 --> 1:10:40.937
I'm sorry.

1:10:42.647 --> 1:10:43.676
I really am.

1:10:50.321 --> 1:10:55.254
Look, this one
probably doesn't have a chance.

1:10:55.289 --> 1:10:57.390
But, when we're down there...

1:10:57.425 --> 1:11:00.055
Are you saying
you want a baby with me?

1:11:03.392 --> 1:11:04.433
Why not?

1:11:06.628 --> 1:11:07.865
I mean, imagine.

1:11:09.202 --> 1:11:11.137
It'd kick butt.

1:11:11.172 --> 1:11:13.973
My brains, your muscles.

1:11:14.009 --> 1:11:15.037
Yeah.

1:11:17.113 --> 1:11:18.575
Yeah, you're right, I'm--

1:11:18.611 --> 1:11:20.812
I'm definitely too tired
for this.

1:11:23.553 --> 1:11:25.982
Eight landings out of ten
must be enough, right?

1:12:18.867 --> 1:12:21.411
Okay, bring me the last one.

1:12:24.711 --> 1:12:27.241
And this is really enough
for 300 people?

1:12:29.152 --> 1:12:31.652
Yep, that's the minimum amount.

1:12:33.284 --> 1:12:34.818
What?

1:12:34.854 --> 1:12:37.119
Again, you think
I'm tricking you or something?

1:12:43.394 --> 1:12:46.959
It's just, you've not said
one word of resistance
the whole day.

1:12:46.995 --> 1:12:48.738
What... What do you want
from me?

1:12:49.931 --> 1:12:51.472
You think I'm stupid enough

1:12:51.508 --> 1:12:54.904
to fly down with algae cultures
that don't work?

1:12:54.939 --> 1:12:57.871
I mean, I can't stay here
without you two.

1:12:57.906 --> 1:13:01.517
So, you won. Congratulations.

1:13:02.647 --> 1:13:04.278
What else do you want from me?

1:13:13.889 --> 1:13:17.263
Okay, all checks are done.

1:13:17.298 --> 1:13:19.334
Are you ready for this?

1:13:19.369 --> 1:13:22.395
Nope.

1:13:22.905 --> 1:13:24.967
Perfect.

1:13:25.003 --> 1:13:27.235
<i> Vesta 1,</i>
<i>flight corridor received.</i>

1:13:27.270 --> 1:13:31.610
Central Nibra,
contacting you again
in 92 minutes.

1:13:31.646 --> 1:13:33.744
<i>Okay, we'll wish you</i>
<i>a safe journey</i>

1:13:33.779 --> 1:13:36.011
<i>-and we're looking--</i>

1:13:36.047 --> 1:13:38.912
And the contact window's
just passed.

1:13:38.947 --> 1:13:41.458
Okay, closing the inner door.

1:13:49.693 --> 1:13:51.391
Uh... What is that?

1:13:53.137 --> 1:13:55.531
The jets are not responding.

1:14:00.604 --> 1:14:01.643
Whoa...

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:09.046
What is that?

1:14:09.081 --> 1:14:12.918
The jet tanks overheated but...
We haven't even ignited.

1:14:12.953 --> 1:14:15.585
-Overheated?
-The temperature keeps rising,
but...

1:14:15.621 --> 1:14:18.157
fuck, that can't be right.

1:14:18.193 --> 1:14:19.160
Hannah, what?

1:14:19.195 --> 1:14:20.591
We have overpressure.

1:14:20.626 --> 1:14:22.298
-Oh, shit.
-Makes no sense.

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:24.132
I need to release the tanks.

1:14:26.162 --> 1:14:29.062
-Did it work?
-The valves are not opening.

1:14:29.097 --> 1:14:31.670
-Try the gas outlet!
-I tried!

1:14:31.705 --> 1:14:34.373
They must have deformed
under the heat!

1:14:34.408 --> 1:14:36.242
How hot are the tanks?

1:14:38.079 --> 1:14:39.109
Hannah?

1:14:40.444 --> 1:14:41.845
Hannah!

1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:45.583
Unfasten immediately!
Get out now!

1:14:49.991 --> 1:14:52.821
-Come on!
-Come on, come on.
Come on.

1:14:52.856 --> 1:14:54.086
Come on,
we're gonna explode!

1:14:54.121 --> 1:14:56.158
Put yourself together.

1:14:56.193 --> 1:14:58.392
You put yourself together!
Come on!

1:15:01.203 --> 1:15:02.231
Go!

1:15:07.771 --> 1:15:11.044
-What the fuck?
-What?

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:16.213
Look.
The Vesta's cooling system
shut down almost 11 hours ago.

1:15:16.249 --> 1:15:19.722
That's why the tanks overheated.
I'll redirect the solar panels.

1:15:19.757 --> 1:15:23.092
Shadow alone
won't do it anymore.
Look at the temperature.

1:15:23.127 --> 1:15:24.459
We need to decouple it.

1:15:24.494 --> 1:15:26.461
No. No, there has to be
another way.

1:15:26.496 --> 1:15:29.459
We can dump the tanks manually,
eh?

1:15:29.495 --> 1:15:31.360
That could work.

1:15:31.395 --> 1:15:34.065
Only from inside the Vesta,
but that's far too dangerous.

1:15:34.730 --> 1:15:35.831
Gavin, stop!

1:15:35.866 --> 1:15:37.565
It could blow up any second!

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.641
Fuck!

1:15:48.545 --> 1:15:51.615
He has to go through
the whole cooling block.
That's impossible.

1:15:51.650 --> 1:15:53.284
He's killing himself.

1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:54.382
All of us.

1:15:57.095 --> 1:15:58.452
Can you still decouple?

1:16:07.397 --> 1:16:09.806
No, no, no! No!
Wait! Hannah!

1:16:09.841 --> 1:16:11.238
No! No!

1:16:11.273 --> 1:16:12.532
No! No!

1:16:13.669 --> 1:16:14.968
Stop!

1:16:15.003 --> 1:16:16.778
-Stop!

1:16:19.808 --> 1:16:20.948
No!

1:16:20.984 --> 1:16:22.182
No!

1:16:22.218 --> 1:16:23.312
Hannah, please!

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:26.318
No!

1:17:40.889 --> 1:17:41.929
I had to.

1:18:35.410 --> 1:18:37.677
You did the right thing,
commander.

1:18:39.983 --> 1:18:41.549
He would have died.

1:18:45.355 --> 1:18:49.326
I know, doesn't seem
like much up here...

1:18:50.662 --> 1:18:52.494
But, uh...

1:18:54.669 --> 1:18:56.102
this place saved our lives.

1:19:00.871 --> 1:19:02.273
Could be home.

1:19:10.145 --> 1:19:11.854
How was it for you?

1:19:15.292 --> 1:19:17.057
Having a child?

1:19:26.466 --> 1:19:27.595
Loud.

1:19:30.934 --> 1:19:32.435
Nerve-wracking.

1:19:33.100 --> 1:19:34.767
Exhausting.

1:19:36.971 --> 1:19:38.276
Amazing.

1:19:43.149 --> 1:19:46.215
You can't possibly imagine
loving anyone

1:19:46.250 --> 1:19:49.023
like you love
this little creature.

1:19:58.300 --> 1:19:59.330
Okay.

1:20:30.558 --> 1:20:33.194
We don't need two people
to tell them.

1:20:33.229 --> 1:20:35.630
-But I was...
-Go or I go.

1:20:44.573 --> 1:20:46.773
Did you do it
because of the pregnancy?

1:20:49.278 --> 1:20:52.350
No. I did it because of us.

1:20:55.282 --> 1:20:57.583
<i> Vesta 1?</i>

1:20:57.619 --> 1:20:59.896
<i>Vesta 1, we can't detect</i>
<i>your signal.</i>

1:21:01.398 --> 1:21:02.791
<i>Do you read?</i>

1:21:02.826 --> 1:21:03.856
<i>Vesta 1?</i>

1:21:05.227 --> 1:21:07.165
Yes, Esther we're here.

1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:09.136
<i>Gavin, where are you?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

1:21:30.185 --> 1:21:31.554
What's IKARUS?

1:21:34.565 --> 1:21:36.196
They said that you would know.

1:21:48.907 --> 1:21:51.340
My actual mission.

1:21:51.376 --> 1:21:53.673
Once I found
a working mother culture,

1:21:53.708 --> 1:21:56.249
I was to bring down
the entire algae lab.

1:21:58.252 --> 1:22:00.848
It can be ejected
and flown down separately.

1:22:01.651 --> 1:22:05.157
-What?
-It was a secret military
operation.

1:22:05.192 --> 1:22:07.163
I'm surprised these CEOs
even know about it.

1:22:07.198 --> 1:22:08.189
W-Wait.

1:22:08.224 --> 1:22:11.264
C-Can we go down
with it?

1:22:12.828 --> 1:22:16.129
It's not made for passengers
and can't be steered.

1:22:16.165 --> 1:22:20.002
Without Navicon
we can only detach it
at a calculated moment and...

1:22:20.037 --> 1:22:21.439
hope for the best.

1:22:22.237 --> 1:22:23.869
But theoretically,

1:22:23.905 --> 1:22:27.181
we could board it
if we adapted it for passengers.

1:22:29.382 --> 1:22:31.546
Hannah, what the fuck?
Why didn't you tell me

1:22:31.582 --> 1:22:33.218
that there was another chance
for re-entry?

1:22:33.253 --> 1:22:35.519
Because
it's not a serious option.
Okay?

1:22:46.637 --> 1:22:49.632
Three people against 300.

1:22:54.011 --> 1:22:57.277
Yes, or even more
if other bunkers made it.

1:23:04.852 --> 1:23:06.616
I think we should do it.

1:23:06.651 --> 1:23:09.151
If we don't try, then it's done
for them down there.

1:23:09.187 --> 1:23:10.818
We can't let that happen.

1:23:11.926 --> 1:23:14.030
This is bigger than us, right?

1:23:17.895 --> 1:23:19.167
Right?

1:24:40.615 --> 1:24:44.010
You, asshole,
disconnected the Vesta
from the cooling cycle.

1:24:44.986 --> 1:24:46.716
We almost died because of you.

1:24:49.256 --> 1:24:51.853
I didn't want, I just--

1:24:53.158 --> 1:24:55.630
I just wanted a delay.

1:24:55.666 --> 1:24:57.232
It was an accident.

1:24:59.828 --> 1:25:02.534
Yeah, I didn't know
the valves can close up.

1:25:02.569 --> 1:25:05.132
I couldn't let what happened
to Danilo happen to us.

1:25:05.168 --> 1:25:07.372
Bullshit.

1:25:07.408 --> 1:25:10.839
You just did it
because you're a selfish coward.

1:25:19.515 --> 1:25:21.190
You know what this is?

1:25:21.986 --> 1:25:24.090
Yeah.

1:25:24.126 --> 1:25:26.124
And you know what it does?

1:25:26.159 --> 1:25:29.195
I found out at some point, yes.

1:25:29.230 --> 1:25:32.832
Good.
'Cause that's what we'll do now.

1:25:32.867 --> 1:25:36.568
We will pump back
the symbiosis cultures
in here and we will fly down.

1:25:37.998 --> 1:25:41.975
So you knew about IKARUS
all of this time?

1:25:42.010 --> 1:25:44.136
And you didn't say anything?

1:25:51.118 --> 1:25:52.947
You didn't want this either.

1:25:55.525 --> 1:25:57.218
Did you?

1:25:57.254 --> 1:25:58.458
Gavin is right.

1:25:59.289 --> 1:26:00.559
We need to help.

1:26:02.399 --> 1:26:06.565
There is no shame
in caring for your own life,
Hannah.

1:26:07.935 --> 1:26:09.405
Especially now.

1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:10.569
Stop it.

1:26:16.043 --> 1:26:21.677
Have you ever asked yourself
why Nibra needed the algae
so bad all of a sudden?

1:26:21.712 --> 1:26:24.580
I mean, for years
they didn't give a fuck.

1:26:24.615 --> 1:26:26.986
Suddenly they want everything,
now.

1:26:27.022 --> 1:26:28.551
They need the system now.

1:26:28.586 --> 1:26:31.559
They send you to space
to get it, why?

1:26:31.595 --> 1:26:33.191
Why, now?

1:26:33.226 --> 1:26:34.890
What are you trying to say?

1:26:36.666 --> 1:26:37.827
They knew.

1:26:42.039 --> 1:26:45.274
They knew a catastrophe
was coming.

1:26:46.767 --> 1:26:48.442
They just didn't tell anyone.

1:26:49.604 --> 1:26:51.113
And why would they?

1:26:51.148 --> 1:26:53.645
They didn't want to share
their bunkers.

1:26:56.820 --> 1:26:58.717
Do you really think,

1:26:58.753 --> 1:27:04.183
they would give you their algae,
if it was the other way around?

1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:18.374
We've made a decision.

1:27:18.409 --> 1:27:21.975
We're sending the algae lab
down to you, like you asked.

1:27:22.011 --> 1:27:24.169
But we're coming with it.

1:27:24.205 --> 1:27:27.940
<i> Okay,</i>
<i>we're looking forward to that.</i>

1:27:27.975 --> 1:27:30.646
Wait, one more thing
before we start.

1:27:30.681 --> 1:27:33.289
I need to talk
to one of the soldiers.

1:27:35.420 --> 1:27:38.622
<i>But I am our representative.</i>

1:27:38.657 --> 1:27:41.330
Yes, but IKARUS
is a military mission, so.

1:27:42.458 --> 1:27:45.598
<i>Eh... okay.</i>

1:27:47.997 --> 1:27:51.967
<i>The thing is...</i>
<i>there are no soldiers here.</i>

1:27:56.447 --> 1:27:59.315
But you said the soldiers
brought you into the bunkers.

1:28:01.618 --> 1:28:06.119
<i>Yes, they brought us here,</i>
<i>but... we have limited space.</i>

1:28:06.154 --> 1:28:08.951
<i>We have room for 300 civilians.</i>

1:28:10.287 --> 1:28:11.484
<i>Families.</i>

1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:12.658
So what? You...

1:28:13.887 --> 1:28:15.397
You just left them outside?

1:28:15.995 --> 1:28:17.025
To die?

1:28:18.495 --> 1:28:20.600
<i>They did their duty.</i>

1:28:22.268 --> 1:28:24.038
That was Nibra's order?

1:28:24.073 --> 1:28:27.407
For all evacuation soldiers?

1:28:27.443 --> 1:28:29.774
<i>Hannah, it is your job</i>
<i>to keep us alive!</i>

1:28:30.780 --> 1:28:32.880
You lied.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:35.944
<i>No, we didn't lie.</i>

1:28:35.979 --> 1:28:40.387
<i>You just assumed</i>
<i>what you wanted to believe.</i>

1:28:40.422 --> 1:28:42.985
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but what were you thinking?</i>

1:28:48.364 --> 1:28:50.823
<i>All we want is to live,</i>
<i>nothing more.</i>

1:28:50.858 --> 1:28:53.498
<i>We want our kids to survive.</i>

1:28:53.534 --> 1:28:56.438
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you can't blame us for that.</i>

1:29:03.981 --> 1:29:09.781
Fuck! Ugh!

1:29:29.270 --> 1:29:31.234
Come on, get off the floor.

1:29:31.270 --> 1:29:33.231
No, I'm done.

1:29:33.267 --> 1:29:35.740
Hannah, they'll run out
of oxygen within days.

1:29:35.776 --> 1:29:39.039
Yeah, and why would
cannon fodder like me care?

1:29:39.074 --> 1:29:42.344
They didn't give a shit
about me. Or Knopf.

1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:44.013
Or my parents.

1:29:46.154 --> 1:29:49.854
Apparently, money and privilege
don't get you a spot
in the bunker either.

1:29:51.958 --> 1:29:54.727
You know that there
are children down there
too, right?

1:29:55.889 --> 1:29:57.257
And what about this one?

1:29:59.633 --> 1:30:01.663
You said that
we couldn't raise it here.

1:30:01.698 --> 1:30:03.967
Why actually not? I mean...

1:30:04.002 --> 1:30:07.337
this place is better
than anywhere I lived before.

1:30:07.372 --> 1:30:09.339
Growing old here?

1:30:09.375 --> 1:30:11.211
Never seeing Earth?

1:30:11.246 --> 1:30:12.811
What kind of a life is that?

1:30:14.214 --> 1:30:15.649
At least a life.

1:30:22.784 --> 1:30:24.492
I... I don't get it.

1:30:24.528 --> 1:30:28.161
Are you just hurt
or do you really want this baby?

1:30:28.196 --> 1:30:31.365
See, I don't know, okay?

1:30:31.400 --> 1:30:34.127
I never thought
about having a child.

1:30:34.163 --> 1:30:36.962
Having a family
meant going back to being poor.

1:30:36.997 --> 1:30:38.901
Not obeying meant being poor.

1:30:38.936 --> 1:30:40.938
A soldier
doesn't even have that choice.

1:30:42.642 --> 1:30:44.444
And that choice
is more important

1:30:44.479 --> 1:30:46.375
than saving
the rest of our world.

1:30:46.411 --> 1:30:48.514
Yes.

1:30:48.549 --> 1:30:51.445
You wouldn't understand that,
domer.

1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:55.085
For someone like you,
it's easy playing
"Save the World."

1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:58.084
But not everyone has a daddy
who sends him up here for safety

1:30:58.120 --> 1:31:00.056
if everything else
goes down the drain.

1:31:02.528 --> 1:31:04.192
Is that really what you think?

1:31:08.266 --> 1:31:09.296
Huh.

1:32:15.104 --> 1:32:16.567
Gavin?

1:32:41.889 --> 1:32:42.928
Open the door.

1:32:47.831 --> 1:32:49.528
I'm finishing what we started.

1:32:50.570 --> 1:32:52.231
Are you leaving me behind?

1:32:52.266 --> 1:32:54.667
No, but I just need
to finish up.

1:32:54.703 --> 1:32:56.036
Just wait.

1:32:56.072 --> 1:32:57.910
How can you know
I won't stop you?

1:33:00.778 --> 1:33:03.647
Because you're a good person.

1:33:03.682 --> 1:33:05.379
And you know that this is right.

1:34:42.219 --> 1:34:44.115
Hannah, wait! Stop!

1:34:45.419 --> 1:34:46.417
Gavin, stop it!

1:34:46.453 --> 1:34:47.420
Please, move!

1:34:47.455 --> 1:34:51.991
No! Gavin! Gavin! Gavin!

1:34:53.659 --> 1:34:55.326
Don't--

1:34:55.361 --> 1:34:56.957
Stop it!

1:34:56.992 --> 1:34:58.360
I can't let you do this.

1:35:19.656 --> 1:35:23.583
Hannah, can--
can we talk about this? I--

1:35:23.618 --> 1:35:27.422
I can't.
I just don't want to.

1:35:29.728 --> 1:35:30.997
Hannah, please just...

1:35:40.571 --> 1:35:41.601
Fuck!

1:35:54.448 --> 1:35:57.287
Hannah,
You can fix this, right?

1:35:58.325 --> 1:35:59.459
Hannah?

1:35:59.495 --> 1:36:03.689
I'm sorry... I wanna stay.

1:38:40.586 --> 1:38:41.847
Gavin?

1:38:48.858 --> 1:38:49.888
Gavin?

1:41:38.027 --> 1:41:39.057
Come on.

1:41:40.498 --> 1:41:42.797
Let's see
if we can fix IKARUS somehow.

1:41:43.836 --> 1:41:45.701
Yeah, what?

1:41:47.102 --> 1:41:48.143
Why?

1:41:50.576 --> 1:41:54.207
We need three breathers
or the gas mix collapses.

1:41:54.242 --> 1:41:55.282
Your words.

1:42:01.648 --> 1:42:05.886
You... You think Gavin did it...

1:42:06.528 --> 1:42:07.860
Yeah.

1:42:07.896 --> 1:42:09.560
He forced his will on us.

1:42:11.063 --> 1:42:12.332
He got what he wanted.

1:42:20.667 --> 1:42:24.102
-What?
-No... No, no, no...

1:42:27.146 --> 1:42:29.283
We need three breathers, right?

1:42:38.153 --> 1:42:41.290
Dimitri?

1:42:41.325 --> 1:42:43.163
I said it after he tried to...

1:42:43.199 --> 1:42:46.894
I just-- I just didn't want him
to harm himself.

1:42:51.708 --> 1:42:53.571
I wanted to save him.

1:43:02.485 --> 1:43:03.942
Stop.

1:43:03.977 --> 1:43:06.320
-I'm sorry. I didn't...
-Okay, just stop.

1:43:36.951 --> 1:43:38.247
No, no, no!

1:43:38.282 --> 1:43:41.485
<i>Nein, nein,</i>
no, now.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:44.318
-I got you. I do.
-No, no, no!

1:43:44.354 --> 1:43:46.756
Let's go.<i> Pashli!</i>

1:43:49.225 --> 1:43:51.094
Let's go!

1:43:51.130 --> 1:43:55.793
<i>Eins, zwei, drei!</i>

1:43:55.829 --> 1:43:57.932
-You!

1:43:58.708 --> 1:44:00.537
Good night, yes?

1:44:00.573 --> 1:44:03.674
-Okay!<i> Warte, warte.</i>

1:44:50.317 --> 1:44:56.795
<i> Hello, hello?</i>
<i>Is there anyone? Hello? Hello?</i>

1:44:56.830 --> 1:44:58.693
Hello?

1:44:58.729 --> 1:45:00.497
<i>Look, guys,</i>
<i>the thing is working.</i>

1:45:00.532 --> 1:45:02.134
<i>Give it to me! Hello?</i>

1:45:02.169 --> 1:45:04.866
Are you in there? In the box?

1:45:04.902 --> 1:45:08.373
<i> No,</i>
<i>we are in the southern camps.</i>

1:45:08.408 --> 1:45:10.543
<i>-And you? What's your name?</i>
-Knopf.

1:45:10.579 --> 1:45:13.604
-<i> Knopf...</i>
-<i> Where are you?</i>

1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:15.877
Eh... Rubikon.

1:45:15.913 --> 1:45:18.218
<i> Can you play outside</i>
<i>there again too?</i>

1:45:18.254 --> 1:45:21.918
No, Mom says
we can't breathe outside.

1:45:21.953 --> 1:45:24.385
<i>So he must still be somewhere</i>
<i>up North.</i>

1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:27.452
<i> Hey, shh.</i>
<i>Well, then ask her</i>
<i>if you can come down here.</i>

1:45:27.488 --> 1:45:30.195
<i>The grown-ups</i>
<i>are always searching</i>
<i>for survivors anyway.</i>

1:45:30.230 --> 1:45:33.796
<i> They say we must help</i>
<i>each other cause everything</i>
<i>is different now.</i>

1:45:33.832 --> 1:45:36.495
<i> Stop it!</i>
<i>Seriously, can't you come?</i>
