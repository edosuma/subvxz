02:07.771 --> 02:10.447
Do you know what he said
to me last time?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.325
I said to him,
"Are you the jolliest at home?"

02:13.425 --> 02:17.538
And he said, "Yes, except for the door knob
because that gives everyone a handshake."

05:15.816 --> 05:17.041
Oi!

05:38.588 --> 05:42.409
Aye, aye, me damsel.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.276
Welcome home, Mr Billy.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.459
- We've been worried to death about you.
- For why?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.169
On account of that explosion.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.546
- What was that?
- At Ostend.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.841
Oh, yes.
I heard tell of that at Antwerp.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.291
Dreadful.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.719
Dirty linen.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.180
Mr William's been getting
in a stew about it.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.475
- Is he out and about his business?
- That he is.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.009
You faring well?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.626
Thank you.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.602
- How was your journey home?
- It was execrable.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.588
You in need of anything else?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.997
Tea?

07:47.884 --> 07:51.913
- Good morning, Signor Grande.
- Mr Turner! Buongiorno.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.995
- Joshua.
- Morning, sir.

07:54.095 --> 07:57.294
- We have damn rats.
- No shortage of them in this city.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.922
Wretched things! It's an epidemic.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.717
- What can I do for you today?
- Well, let me see.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.595
- He is back?
- We are expecting him any day now.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.056
Bravo! The prodigal son.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.350
- Pronti. What do we need?
- An ounce of chrome yellow.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.561
- Chrome yellow, Joshua.
- Chrome yellow, sir.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.346
- A large packet of flake white.
- Flake white.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.817
What is your price
for a bladder of ultramarine?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.736
My price is the best price.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.988
And what might that price be?

08:25.088 --> 08:29.576
Blue ultramarine is coming
from far, far away: Afghanistan.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.080
- What else do you need?
- Bottle of poppy oil, some Indian red.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.614
- Poppy oil, Joshua.
- Yes, sir.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.536
There's your prize porker.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.579
Is he handsome?

09:14.679 --> 09:17.197
He has a big smile on his face.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.378
- You're making the sauce?
- It's all but done, save the brains.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.506
Good. Oh... dearie me!

09:24.606 --> 09:28.677
- Will you take a dish of tea, Mr William?
- Oh, thank ye, Hannah.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.721
Shall you be putting those chattels away?
I should.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.515
- Best do it now.
- Yes.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.717
Then I can rest me weary legs.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.322
You're home, Billy boy!

10:01.184 --> 10:03.712
Hey, Daddy!

10:05.146 --> 10:07.048
I thought you was exploded.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.885
I been down on my knees
and praying you was safe.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.054
Well, you been chafing your old pedestals
for naught, Daddy.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.472
I was a hundred miles distant.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.516
- Oh, you heard tell of it, then?
- I did indeed.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.061
Terrible, they pour souls as perished,
two score or more.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.315
Took a few brave soldiers
with it an' all.

10:23.415 --> 10:26.985
I was vexed to learn
you been entertaining concerns, old Dadda.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.144
'Twas only natural.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.490
Oh, Daddy!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.284
How was your crossing?

10:34.384 --> 10:37.662
Set fair on departure,
lumpy in the middle.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.707
- Did you sail from Rotterdam?
- No, Dieppe.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.295
Night coach from Brighton
proved to be an heinous travail.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.338
How so?

10:46.438 --> 10:49.174
It was stuffed full of yacking
and cackling females.

10:49.274 --> 10:53.053
Pox-ridden harridan as broad in the beam
as the old Victory at Trafalgar.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.849
- Were your travels productive?
- Exceeding refreshing, old Daddy.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.392
Yeah, Amsterdam.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.978
Had a gander at the Rembrandt.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.648
Militia Company, Antwerp Cathedral.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.566
Rubens, the triptych.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.069
Flanders,
still as flat as a witch's tit.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.646
Thank you, Hannah. You sly girl.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.409
Did you find tolerable diggings?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.621
Stinking flea pit at Dieppe,
then moved to the harbour.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.332
Westerly aspect, fine sunset.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.168
Oh, Daddy,
I'm in need of an eight-by-six.

11:25.268 --> 11:30.131
I have a seven by five-and-a-half
ready sized and primed.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.926
- That should suit.
- Right you be.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.887
More's to the point,
how you been faring?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.597
In good health, thank the Lord.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.975
- Bronchioles still rattling?
- No.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.394
He was wheezing last week.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.981
October ain't quite come
round the corner yet, has it?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.857
I've been over to Grande's.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.403
Ultramarine's gone up
to a guinea a bladder.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.821
Gawd's truth!

11:52.921 --> 11:54.980
That brigand still robbing us, is he?

11:56.174 --> 12:00.996
- You're in need of a shave.
- Yeah, well, be that as it may, Daddy.

12:01.096 --> 12:05.282
Presently I'm gonna throw myself
into the arms of Morpheus.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.618
No!

13:00.155 --> 13:03.016
I took a trip down west,
Exeter, last week.

13:04.868 --> 13:08.271
- How fares the old uncle?
- Bearing up, considering.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.192
- Considering what?
- Well, his age, living alone.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.115
Here's the thing.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.067
He wants to arrange a family gathering.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.639
Will you take some more cheek?

13:42.739 --> 13:46.017
Yeah, cast us another morsel.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.937
Missing your button, Mr Billy.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.238
Be so kind as to enter the vestibule.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.082
The darkness is to a purpose.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.753
I shall return by and by.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.073
Madam.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.409
Gentlemen.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.625
Behold.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.508
Three steps down.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.479
Pray, view at your leisure.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.358
- Good day to you, Hannah.
- Good day to you, Aunt Sarah.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.944
- And how are you faring?
- Very well, thank you.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.404
- Are you coming in?
- I most certainly am. Is he at home?

16:03.504 --> 16:06.815
- He is. I'll tell him you're here.
- I can inform him myself, thank you kindly.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.997
- Good day to you, sir.
- And a very good day to you, Mrs D.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.333
And how do we find you
on this fair morning?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.669
Exceedingly preoccupied, madam.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.338
'Twas ever thus.
You've always been preoccupied.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.507
You're too preoccupied
for your own good, sir.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.467
Nothing comes from nothing, madam.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.043
And we have had nothing from you, sir.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.599
Evelina, Georgiana,
come and greet your father.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.186
Good day, Father.
May I present my child to you?

16:35.286 --> 16:37.480
- Your granddaughter.
- Rosalie Adelaide.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.774
Your only surviving grandchild.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.151
Georgiana, cease your dithering!

16:42.251 --> 16:44.821
May I suggest, Mrs D,
with the utmost respect,

16:44.921 --> 16:47.865
that you withdraw to the drawing room?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.952
Good day to you, Mrs Danby.
Would you care to step this way?

16:51.052 --> 16:52.704
Good day to you, Mr Turner.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.581
And will you be gracing us
with your presence

16:54.681 --> 16:56.708
in the withdrawing room, sir?

16:56.808 --> 16:59.836
I sincerely hope you will.
And, pray, do not keep us waiting.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.755
We have our own lives to lead.
Come along, daughters.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.249
The vapours in this room
are most noxious to a child's lungs.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.055
Ladies, pray, sit yourselves.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.400
Sarah, if you please.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.569
I shall be seated, William,
when it suits me and not before.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.186
So be it.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.992
- She's a pretty little thing.
- Thank you, Grandfather.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.453
- We are most proud of her.
- We are indeed.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.997
- Have you been out strolling, Aunt Sarah?
- No, niece.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.249
I've been to collect my pension
at Leicester Fields,

17:38.349 --> 17:41.121
- it being the first of the month.
- Indeed.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.049
- Your latest infant?
- To be sure, Father.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.635
- Of robust constitution?
- She has an excellent character.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.596
One must trust in providence.
Colour of eye?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.681
- Blue, as yourself.
- Splendid.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.516
Do not forget your other daughter, sir,

17:55.616 --> 17:58.102
whom you have deigned to neglect
these past two years.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.063
Sit down, Georgiana.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.607
- She is learning French.
- And music.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.525
She is having an education.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.655
Reading, writing, arithmetic
and geography with the globe.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.365
Sit up straight, Georgie!

18:10.465 --> 18:12.033
Say something in French.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.743
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, Papa.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.454
- Are you keeping well?
- I am.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.456
I was not addressing you, sir.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.084
I enjoy good health, thank'ee.
And yourself?

18:21.184 --> 18:24.295
We are surviving as best we can
under the circumstances.

18:24.395 --> 18:28.466
- And what circumstances might they be?
- Straightened circumstances, sir.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.468
But we manage
to keep body and soul together,

18:30.568 --> 18:33.503
no thanks to your ungrateful son.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.974
How dare you take your leave of me,
Billy Turner!

18:37.074 --> 18:41.270
You insult me,
as you have always insulted me!

18:41.370 --> 18:42.888
Billy!

19:22.036 --> 19:23.354
Good evening, William.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.389
Felicitations of the evening to you,
your Lordship.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.360
You faring well?

19:29.460 --> 19:33.072
Bit breathless. Been up to the farm.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.620
Watch the sunset,
say goodnight to the milkmaids.

19:40.888 --> 19:44.157
Any further consideration
to mechanicalising the thresher?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.713
You can't beat the old oxen.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.175
- Is that so, your Lordship?
- Indeed.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.470
We had a ploughing competition
last spring

19:55.570 --> 19:58.389
between teams of horses
and teams of oxen.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.516
- And the victor?
- The horses.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.145
- Well, the ox is a sluggish beast.
- Yes, but strong.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.856
With the added benefit, when it comes
to the end of its working life,

20:06.956 --> 20:08.890
it makes a very succulent dish.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.069
Unlike the horse.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.196
Good for glue.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.897
Ahem... your Lordship!

20:18.384 --> 20:21.621
- A very good evening to you, sir.
- Evening, Manners.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.726
Mr Turner.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.959
Are we not blessed by the heavens

20:27.059 --> 20:33.331
to witness so glorious
a crepuscular time of day?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.585
Imbecile.

20:41.532 --> 20:46.187
Continuing satisfaction
as to the arrangement, your Lordship?

20:46.287 --> 20:51.818
I think we have successfully achieved
the correct effect, William.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.518
Thank you.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.866
- Good evening, Nat.
- Oh, good evening, my Lord.

20:58.966 --> 21:03.454
- Good evening, Miss Coggins.
- Your Lordship, Turner.

21:03.554 --> 21:07.208
- How's your father faring, William?
- Oh, bearing up, your Lordship.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.961
Very gracious of you to inquire.

21:10.061 --> 21:14.006
We thought we'd lost him
this last winter, a very harsh one.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.759
He came through. He's a hardy old cove.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.460
Excellent.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.421
- See you at dinner.
- Indeed.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.605
Exceedingly beautiful.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.806
You are too kind.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.444
I'm familiar with the melody, but...

22:16.544 --> 22:18.613
Herr Beethoven.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.197
The "Pathétique".

22:28.139 --> 22:32.117
I possess a rare fondness
for... Henry Purcell.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.795
As do I.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.127
Yes.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.510
"Dido's Lament."

22:56.792 --> 23:00.321
May my wrongs create

23:00.421 --> 23:02.114
Create

23:02.214 --> 23:04.659
No sorrow...

23:04.759 --> 23:05.868
- Trouble.
- Trou...

23:05.968 --> 23:08.663
No trouble

23:08.763 --> 23:11.874
- In thy breast... thy breast...
- Thy breast.

23:11.974 --> 23:15.702
In thy brea... breast

23:20.733 --> 23:24.752
Remember me

23:27.198 --> 23:30.383
Remember me

23:33.329 --> 23:35.305
But...

23:36.040 --> 23:38.192
- Ah! Forget my fate.
- Ah!

23:38.292 --> 23:41.936
Forget my fate

23:43.672 --> 23:48.985
Remember me

23:49.178 --> 23:51.497
But ah!

23:51.597 --> 23:55.700
Forget my fa...

23:57.144 --> 23:58.912
My fate

24:06.612 --> 24:08.755
A song of lost love.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.550
Indeed.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.522
I thank you.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.224
Thank you, Mr Turner.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.977
Madam.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.402
Mr Turner?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.447
I have often pondered,
might there be a distinction

25:06.547 --> 25:09.909
between the way you paint a sunrise
as opposed to a sunset?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.995
Oh, there is indeed, Lady Stuckley.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.082
Yeah, cos one is going up
whilst the other...

25:16.182 --> 25:18.459
- The other is going down!
- Oh, Eliza, do hush.

25:18.559 --> 25:22.880
And might it also be determined
by the angle of the light?

25:22.980 --> 25:25.716
Well, it's weather,

25:25.816 --> 25:27.176
vapour,

25:27.276 --> 25:28.427
wind,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.679
frangibility and such like.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.181
Eliza, look at his nails!

25:32.281 --> 25:36.060
Whilst you goddesses are languishing
in the kingdom of Hypnos,

25:36.160 --> 25:40.189
I am up before the lark to witness Helios
popping his head above the parapet,

25:40.289 --> 25:44.225
with the only benefit
that the sunrise is not afflicted...

25:44.960 --> 25:46.978
with diminishing light.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.331
- Carew.
- Oh!

25:57.431 --> 25:59.208
Turner!

25:59.308 --> 26:02.744
I'm by way of observing
poor Saint Sebastian here.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.214
The artist is not known to me.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.632
- Flemish.
- Oh.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.718
Uncommonly capacious rump on the cherub.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.763
It might have gained in potency
with an increase of arrows.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.266
Well, yon celestial fellow
is tugging them all out.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.809
I can hardly bear to look upon it.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.856
The pain on his face,
the mark of resignation in it.

26:21.956 --> 26:24.108
'Tis a willing sacrifice, is it not?

26:24.208 --> 26:26.694
'Twas not how the poor soul perished.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.822
He was brought back to full health
by a good Samaritan.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.617
Then the heathens cudgelled him to death
and deposited him in a sewer.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.453
I would question
the veracity of that telling.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.988
No good deed goes unpunished.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.713
What a curious fate is mine.

26:47.356 --> 26:51.260
Last month in the King's Bench Prison
in the company of debtors,

26:51.360 --> 26:53.929
this month a guest
of quality, rank and fashion.

26:54.029 --> 26:58.142
Rejoice, Haydon. You find yourself
in a veritable Bacchanalia.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.478
His Lordship keeps
a very fine wine cellar.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.772
Be sanguine, fill your boots.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.608
Might I ask you
to loan me some money, Turner?

27:05.708 --> 27:06.942
I beg your pardon?

27:07.042 --> 27:10.529
I am in dire and pressing need
of 100 pounds.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.822
Out of the question.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.533
My landlord,
he's a good man, a patient man,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.493
but he will not wait forever.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.413
I need to pay the wine merchant,
my colour man...

27:19.513 --> 27:22.208
And your dear wife, Mrs Haydon,
is she faring well?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.210
Mrs Haydon is presently with child.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.670
Well, you have my hearty
congratulations, Haydon.

27:26.770 --> 27:30.424
Congratulations are not in order.
I'm in torment.

27:30.524 --> 27:34.178
I am not unsympathetic
to your impecunity, Haydon.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.097
Therefore I can advance you 50 pounds.

27:37.197 --> 27:41.101
Turner, if 100 pounds will not spare me
from this predicament,

27:41.201 --> 27:43.562
what in Jesu's name can 50 pounds do?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.398
Then you are refusing
to accept the 50 pounds?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.809
- It is damned inadequate.
- I wish you good day, sir.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.616
- Turner?
- Hey, hey!

27:55.716 --> 27:57.993
My word is my bond.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.580
I may not yet be an Academician
but I am a gentleman.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.541
I have a painting
presently with the King at Windsor.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.003
I am assured he will buy it from me
for 500 guineas or more.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.673
Furthermore, I have another
fine painting in mind,

28:10.773 --> 28:11.924
a companion piece,

28:12.024 --> 28:13.968
which he is most certain
to purchase in addition.

28:14.068 --> 28:16.178
Who has made these assurances?

28:16.278 --> 28:19.056
- The King's private secretary, Knighton.
- Oh.

28:19.156 --> 28:24.311
Well, I can furnish you
with five pounds this morning.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.688
Five pounds?

28:25.788 --> 28:29.108
50 pounds is not sufficient.
Five pounds is tantamount to an insult.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.361
Sir, I beseech you, brook your ire.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.030
If you attend my residence at London,

28:35.130 --> 28:37.482
I will loan you 50 pounds.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.735
In addition to the five?

28:41.637 --> 28:45.448
Mr Haydon, you are exceedingly tiresome.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.037
I am gratified.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.258
I humbly accept the 50 pounds.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.406
Might I find you at the same address?

29:02.366 --> 29:03.966
I may swim.

29:07.204 --> 29:10.399
"And the spirit immediately
drove him out into the wilderness."

29:10.499 --> 29:13.235
A tormented soul, for sure.

29:13.335 --> 29:16.739
I sympathise,
but he attributes all of his failures

29:16.839 --> 29:19.325
- to anything other than his own behaviour.
- Indeed.

29:19.425 --> 29:24.371
His complaint with life is as absurd
as that of a spoke in a wheel,

29:24.471 --> 29:28.042
railing against the motion
that it must of necessity partake.

29:28.142 --> 29:32.046
I concur.
He suffers the fate of Tantalus.

29:32.146 --> 29:35.132
He reaches for the fruit,
the branch moves.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.843
When he stoops to drink
the water goes down.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.721
If only he would consider
the wishes of his public

29:40.821 --> 29:44.183
rather than pursuing
his own peculiar convictions,

29:44.283 --> 29:45.434
it would be his salvation.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.854
And yet, my dear Beechey,
as his personal troubles increase,

29:48.954 --> 29:51.815
so the quality of his painting suffers.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.444
- But still, the man can paint.
- For sure, he can paint a Haydon.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.947
The return of one prodigal
is worth more than gold.

29:59.047 --> 30:03.369
An essential quality
for a prodigal, sir, is humility.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.788
He is a cracked pot.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.290
He's heading for a fall.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.543
Gentlemen, are we as one?

30:12.143 --> 30:15.830
Sadly... I cannot give him my support.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.093
He is not of our temper.

30:19.193 --> 30:22.054
Alas, the Academy
does not have need of Haydon

30:22.154 --> 30:25.506
so much as Haydon
has need of the Academy.

30:48.388 --> 30:54.670
Here the rose that decks thy door

30:54.770 --> 31:01.051
Here the thorn that spreads thy bower

31:01.151 --> 31:06.849
Here the willow on the moor

31:06.949 --> 31:09.476
The birds at rest

31:09.576 --> 31:12.845
Above thee

31:13.830 --> 31:19.945
Had they light of life to see

31:20.045 --> 31:26.285
Sense of soul like thee and me

31:26.385 --> 31:31.999
Soon might each a witness be

31:32.099 --> 31:34.835
How dotingly

31:34.935 --> 31:39.997
I love thee

31:40.482 --> 31:46.430
Here we meet too soon to part

31:46.530 --> 31:52.978
Here to leave would raise a smart

31:53.078 --> 31:58.275
Here I'll press thee to my heart

31:58.375 --> 32:01.737
Where none have place

32:01.837 --> 32:05.856
Above thee

32:23.317 --> 32:25.677
With your Lordship's permission,

32:25.777 --> 32:28.555
ladies and gentlemen,
our next offering, we hope,

32:28.655 --> 32:31.808
is of a somewhat more playful nature.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.603
- Playful as you wish.
- Thank you.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.056
Oh! No, it isn't!

32:57.267 --> 33:02.089
I'm a poor simple girl
so excuse me, sir, pray

33:02.189 --> 33:06.426
I am just one and twenty
the first of next May

33:06.526 --> 33:11.390
I never do harm but I tend to my farm

33:11.490 --> 33:17.762
I'm up early and late
and though humble my state

33:18.288 --> 33:23.068
I don't envy my betters
but bear 'em good will

33:23.168 --> 33:26.154
And I'm called Pretty Kitty

33:26.254 --> 33:28.532
Pretty Kitty

33:28.632 --> 33:30.784
Pretty Kitty

33:30.884 --> 33:33.652
The maid of the mill

33:38.475 --> 33:41.795
I have lovers in plenty
come hither to woo...

33:43.313 --> 33:48.051
If they will be so teasing,
pray, what can I do?

33:48.151 --> 33:52.806
I'm good-tempered and kind
and a youth to my mind

33:52.906 --> 33:59.470
Who is open and free
would be happy with me

34:00.414 --> 34:05.569
But they all are so stupid
that none of them will

34:05.669 --> 34:08.739
Pop the question to Kitty

34:08.839 --> 34:11.158
Pretty Kitty

34:11.257 --> 34:13.659
Pretty Kitty

34:13.760 --> 34:16.570
The maid of the mill

36:02.369 --> 36:05.638
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day to thee.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.900
You be a lodgings, then?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.517
It be.

36:12.796 --> 36:16.533
- This chamber, 'tis available?
- It is, aye.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.400
May I peruse it?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.119
Mrs Booth!

36:35.610 --> 36:37.628
There be a gentleman.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.642
- Good day to you, sir.
- Good day to you, madam.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.728
- Are you seeking lodgings?
- Indeed I am.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.220
Here, Mr Booth.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.693
- Your top front, 'tis available?
- Maybe, sir, yes.

36:51.793 --> 36:55.980
- May I peruse it?
- Indeed, sir, if you'd care to follow me.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.868
- You just come off the boat?
- Indeed.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.578
- The Maggie or the Billy?
- The Maggie.

37:01.678 --> 37:05.656
- Oh, 'twas early today!
- We'd the best of the tide.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.419
There.

37:09.519 --> 37:12.506
- This be my better most chamber.
- Exceeding homely.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.090
Oh, I do thank you, sir.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.292
You're looking
at the finest view in Margate.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.806
They do say this town
be the first place in England

37:20.906 --> 37:22.641
that the sun do reach of a morning.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.645
Now, all my linen is freshly aired,
clean and sweet-smelling,

37:26.745 --> 37:30.097
and I can lay a fire for you,
should you require.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.058
Now, sir...

37:33.752 --> 37:37.155
my terms is one guinea for the week
with no meals

37:37.255 --> 37:39.324
or full board for
an extra 15 and sixpence.

37:39.424 --> 37:43.527
And I'm afraid I do have to ask
for a small deposit and a reference.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.992
- Five pound.
- 'Tis my reference and deposit.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.421
Oh, I can't take this, sir.
It is far too much.

37:53.521 --> 37:57.374
Refund of balance on departure.
That suit you, madam?

37:58.193 --> 38:00.294
I do thank ye, sir.

38:01.237 --> 38:04.140
Well, I should introduce myself.
My name is Mrs Booth.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.060
- And you, sir?
- Beg your pardon?

38:07.160 --> 38:09.437
- I was asking your name, sir.
- Mallard.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.606
Oh... Mr Mallard.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.860
Well, I do hope you'll be
most comfortable here, Mr Mallard.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.070
Now, is there anything else
I can provide for you?

38:17.170 --> 38:20.073
A small bowl of water, madam,
if you'd be so kind.

38:20.173 --> 38:23.776
- Might that be a glass of water?
- No, a bowl.

38:24.469 --> 38:28.155
Very well, sir.
I shall bring that up for you.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.130
Yes?

38:47.242 --> 38:50.604
I found you a small bowl, sir.
I hope this do suit your requirements.

38:50.704 --> 38:51.646
Indeed.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.523
Where would you like
I should put it for you?

38:53.623 --> 38:56.558
Upon the window sill,
if you'd be so kind.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.781
Good. Oh, dear!
Do be coming along blowing now.

39:01.881 --> 39:06.703
Well... I shall serve your supper downstairs
in the parlour at six of the clock.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.705
And if you ever feel the need
of a bit of company

39:08.805 --> 39:11.541
you'd be more than welcome
to join Mr Booth and I in our kitchen.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.878
- I would not wish to impose, madam.
- Oh, not at all, Mr Mallard.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.496
We should be glad of your company.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.819
- I'll top up your ale, Mr Mallard.
- Thank you kindly, madam.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.863
I hope you're enjoying your supper.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.531
Oh, good.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.868
Some folk do find shackles
too salty for their taste.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.653
Can never be too salty for me, madam.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.060
There, Mr Mallard. This'll warm you up.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.187
No, no, you sit yourself down.

40:14.287 --> 40:17.607
I can squeeze around here
just about these days.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.652
- So, you had a good walk, then?
- As far as Broadstairs and back.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.489
Oh, dear! That is a long way.
You'll sleep well tonight.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.116
Your very good health, madam, sir.

40:26.216 --> 40:29.327
- Very good health to you too, sir.
- Will you not take a drink yourself?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.997
I ain't touched a drop
this many a long year.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.541
He did used to enjoy a tipple,
though that were long before I knew him.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.335
- Man of the sea?
- He was, weren't he?

40:37.435 --> 40:41.256
- Ship's carpenter.
- Carpenter? Noble craft.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.049
What'd you ply?

40:43.149 --> 40:45.176
Whalers? Spicers?

40:45.276 --> 40:47.294
- Traders?
- Slavers.

40:48.321 --> 40:51.298
- For my sins.
- He don't like to talk about it, though.

40:52.492 --> 40:56.396
Africa, Zanzibar, the Indies.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.606
Such terrible sufferings I did see.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.942
Treated like animals, they was.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.986
Worse than.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.946
The howling sound of sorrow.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.563
Yes.

41:07.632 --> 41:11.077
- Changed my life, it did.
- Oh, it did there.

41:11.177 --> 41:14.321
Led me back to chapel.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.408
Humans.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.578
Humans can be dreadful cruel.

41:22.397 --> 41:26.541
I watch them boys down there in the sands
whipping them poor donkeys.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.137
Mind you, you're better off
being a donkey

41:29.237 --> 41:32.172
than them wretched souls
on the slave ships.

41:36.578 --> 41:39.481
So, are you familiar with Margate,
Mr Mallard?

41:39.581 --> 41:40.565
As a boy.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.400
Oh, there.
You come here on your holidays, then?

41:42.500 --> 41:44.486
Schooling, two years.

41:44.586 --> 41:48.156
Oh, yes, Margate be
famous for its schools.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.700
- Coleman's.
- Oh.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.202
Mr Coleman? I do remember he.

41:52.302 --> 41:55.112
- Up there by the Dane.
- Back of the old town.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.628
I lost two dear friends.

42:01.728 --> 42:04.923
- I am sorry.
- Scrofula.

42:05.023 --> 42:09.376
- Oh, yes. Terrible sickness.
- Aye.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.300
Long time ago.

42:32.217 --> 42:36.194
- Oh! Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, madam.

42:36.638 --> 42:40.041
- It is Mrs Somerville.
- Yes, you are expected.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.242
Thank you most kindly.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.579
Oh, what an elegant residence.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.800
Have you come far, Mrs Somerville?

42:48.900 --> 42:52.512
Oh, yes, indeed.
All the way from Chelsea.

42:52.612 --> 42:54.973
I took the steamer to Westminster,
about an hour.

42:55.073 --> 42:58.059
- Was the river busy?
- Extremely.

42:58.159 --> 43:00.895
You can see the whole world
on the Thames.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.773
- Mrs Somerville.
- Oh, good afternoon, Mr Turner.

43:03.873 --> 43:06.109
My apologies if I have forced you
to wait upon me.

43:06.209 --> 43:10.947
Oh, not at all. I have enjoyed
a most pleasant interlude with your father.

43:11.047 --> 43:13.992
- You find yourself well?
- Passing fair, thank you. And you?

43:14.092 --> 43:16.411
Indeed. Dr Somerville likewise?

43:16.511 --> 43:21.573
Oh, yes, he's much engaged
in administering to the poor veterans.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.252
Well, now, it's a beautiful sunny day,

43:24.352 --> 43:27.213
just perfect for our experiment.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.424
I have everything I need
here in my wee bag.

43:29.524 --> 43:31.634
Are we going to witness an explosion?

43:31.734 --> 43:33.553
Oh, goodness me! No, I hope not.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.555
I'm astounded
you have all your paraphernalia

43:35.655 --> 43:38.850
- contained in yon small pouch.
- Indeed it is, Mr Turner.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.967
Everything except God's good sunlight.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.647
Daddy, Mrs Somerville
is a natural philosopher.

43:44.747 --> 43:48.818
- Is she, now?
- Mathematician, astronomer, geologist.

43:48.918 --> 43:51.696
The universe is a wondrous thing,
is it not, Mr Turner?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.448
It is, to be sure.

43:53.548 --> 43:54.991
The planets and the stars,

43:55.091 --> 43:57.202
the oceans and the tides,

43:57.302 --> 43:59.704
the clouds and the air,

43:59.804 --> 44:01.915
mountains, volcanoes...

44:02.015 --> 44:04.709
The tides be subject
to the effect of the moon.

44:04.809 --> 44:08.713
Quite so,
the mysterious force of gravity.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.872
It is my strong belief

44:11.607 --> 44:14.376
that all things on this earth
are connected.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.505
- Nothing exists in isolation.
- Indeed.

44:19.824 --> 44:23.311
The rain falls, the sun shines

44:23.411 --> 44:25.355
and the onions grow.

44:25.455 --> 44:26.522
Oh, yes.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.067
Daddy likes to affect the pretence
of being a dunce.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.652
He is in fact a man of high intellect.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.488
- He taught me how to read and write.
- Is that so?

44:33.588 --> 44:38.201
- Education is an important thing.
- It is indeed, most important for everyone.

44:38.301 --> 44:41.871
I myself am presently engaged
in the tutoring of my children.

44:41.971 --> 44:43.539
That is indeed commendable.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.917
It is a privilege
that was not afforded to me.

44:46.017 --> 44:49.161
I am an uneducated,
self-taught Scotch woman.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.465
Mrs Somerville, you are what you are.

44:52.565 --> 44:54.467
- As are we, Daddy.
- True.

44:54.567 --> 44:56.209
Thank you.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.514
And what was your profession, Mr Turner?

44:59.614 --> 45:01.891
Daddy was the finest barber
in Covent Garden.

45:01.991 --> 45:04.269
I had some success in the business.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.603
Wig maker.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.314
He was a master
of the razor and the brush.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.441
You're the master of the brush now,
Mr Turner.

45:10.541 --> 45:11.651
Well...

45:11.751 --> 45:14.237
My little lad could draw
afore he could read and write.

45:14.337 --> 45:17.481
Sat in the corner of the shop,
scratching away with the chalk and charcoal.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.617
I'd stick his pictures in the window.

45:19.717 --> 45:20.994
And sell 'em, all of 'em.

45:21.094 --> 45:23.445
For two or three shillings apiece
on occasion.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.748
Do you have children
yourself, Mr Turner?

45:25.848 --> 45:28.200
I do not, Mrs Somerville.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.789
Thank you, Mr Turner.

45:35.608 --> 45:37.927
- Have you ever seen a prism?
- I have not.

45:40.655 --> 45:42.339
There it is.

45:43.908 --> 45:46.561
That is a thing of beauty.

45:46.661 --> 45:50.523
Shortly you shall witness
a rainbow passing through it.

45:50.623 --> 45:53.693
Sir Isaac Newton, Daddy.

45:53.793 --> 45:57.697
Gentlemen, might I request
that you close the shutters, please?

45:57.797 --> 45:59.731
Daddy.

46:02.260 --> 46:05.153
Tell us when to cease, Mrs Somerville.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.698
We need to create an aperture...

46:09.851 --> 46:12.118
to strengthen the colours.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.382
- There.
- Daddy!

46:16.482 --> 46:19.761
- Aha!
- Let us put the paper in place.

46:19.861 --> 46:23.514
- Daddy, some tacks for Mrs Somerville.
- No, no tacks, Mr Turner.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.341
The metal could contaminate
the experiment.

46:28.161 --> 46:30.345
A wee nub of wax.

46:35.168 --> 46:36.560
Paper.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.655
And what is the purpose
of the small piece of paper?

46:39.755 --> 46:45.578
I shall cover the bottom half of the needle
so that it is not exposed.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.751
And what is it you are about now,
Mrs Somerville?

46:51.851 --> 46:54.703
You'll have to wait and see, won't you?

46:58.983 --> 47:01.344
Daddy, I wager that is the first time

47:01.444 --> 47:03.805
you've witnessed a hammer
being produced from a lady's reticule.

47:03.905 --> 47:05.714
For certain 'tis!

47:13.831 --> 47:16.025
You have the arm of a blacksmith,
Mrs Somerville.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.605
There, now.

47:23.758 --> 47:27.110
That has thrown
all those wee particles into chaos.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.071
Particles into chaos.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.502
What is the element contained
within the violet light

47:34.602 --> 47:36.254
such as magnetises the material?

47:36.354 --> 47:40.133
That is what, as yet, Mr Turner,
I do not know.

47:40.233 --> 47:43.177
- The majesty of mystery.
- Indeed.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.805
Now, let us allow nature
to take its course.

47:45.905 --> 47:49.100
Although we will have to adjust
the position of the easel from time to time.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.520
Indeed, as mighty Apollo moves
across his heavenly tract.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.105
Yes!

47:54.205 --> 47:56.732
- Three steps down, Mrs Somerville.
- Take care.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.768
Oh, my goodness me!

48:00.336 --> 48:03.030
Oh, Mr Turner, I am quite overwhelmed.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.241
Do as you wish, view as you wish.

48:05.341 --> 48:08.995
Oh, my!
These are breathtaking, are they not?

48:09.095 --> 48:12.039
My dear late father
would have much appreciated them.

48:12.139 --> 48:15.668
- A naval man, I believe.
- Indeed, he was a vice admiral.

48:15.768 --> 48:19.046
- We have the Battle of Trafalgar over here.
- Was he there, your father?

48:19.146 --> 48:21.748
Er, no, he was at Camperdown.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.261
- Lord Nelson's flagship, the Victory.
- Indeed.

48:25.361 --> 48:28.181
- It's a sketch for the painting.
- Oh?

48:28.281 --> 48:30.516
- Commissioned by the King.
- Is that so?

48:30.616 --> 48:32.643
Two years in the making.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.229
- He didn't like it.
- Did he not?

48:35.329 --> 48:36.689
- No.
- Too good for him.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.318
Two years!

48:40.418 --> 48:42.862
It takes me only half an hour
to paint a picture.

48:42.962 --> 48:44.697
So you are an artist, Mrs Somerville?

48:44.797 --> 48:48.784
Oh, I don't think we can quite use that term
in the presence of Mr Turner.

48:48.884 --> 48:52.079
Nevertheless, Daddy,
Mrs Somerville is a fine watercolourist.

48:52.179 --> 48:54.916
Oh, you flatter me.
Oh, what an epic storm scene!

48:55.016 --> 48:57.659
Rock crushing a house in Switzerland.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.995
Calais sands, women digging for bait.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.790
I don't care for that much.

49:08.779 --> 49:11.140
Oh, my! What have we here?

49:11.240 --> 49:14.143
Oh, it's Hannibal crossing the Alps.

49:14.243 --> 49:16.771
Do you see the elephant?

49:16.871 --> 49:20.390
- An elephant?
- He's in there somewhere.

49:21.208 --> 49:25.061
- Are you teasing me, Mr Turner?
- By no means, madam.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.046
Can you find him?

49:42.146 --> 49:44.581
Well, no, I cannot.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.750
There he is.

49:47.485 --> 49:50.846
- Oh! Ha, ha!
- Daddy's little jest.

49:53.407 --> 49:56.602
Oh, it is a terrifying scene!

49:56.702 --> 49:59.188
The elements dwarfing the elephants.

49:59.288 --> 50:00.889
Hubris.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.687
There.

50:08.339 --> 50:11.274
Shall I make it do a wee dance?

50:12.051 --> 50:15.538
So, the end of the needle
that was exposed to the violet light

50:15.638 --> 50:17.415
has produced a magnetic north pole.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.917
- Like a compass?
- Exactly so.

50:20.017 --> 50:22.878
Whereas, Mr Turner,
had I done the same experiment

50:22.978 --> 50:24.672
using the red end of the spectrum,

50:24.772 --> 50:27.133
this needle would not
have been magnetised.

50:27.233 --> 50:31.596
I have, from time to time, attempted it
with the green and the blue,

50:31.696 --> 50:34.765
and it has succeeded on occasion
but not consistently.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.175
Colour is contradictory.

50:37.910 --> 50:41.147
Well, is it, Mr Turner?

50:41.247 --> 50:42.648
Colour is absolute.

50:42.748 --> 50:46.267
Sublime but contradictory
yet harmonious.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.322
You are a man of great vision,
Mr Turner.

50:50.631 --> 50:54.192
The universe is chaotic
and you make us see it.

50:55.344 --> 50:57.079
In natural philosophy

50:57.179 --> 51:00.583
nothing can ever be proved,
only disproved.

51:00.683 --> 51:03.878
The purity of your prism,
the contamination of my palette.

51:03.978 --> 51:07.214
Natural light, blackness.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.416
White is the power of good,
black is the devil.

51:19.410 --> 51:25.191
Transparent bodies depend so much
upon what is opposed to them,

51:25.291 --> 51:27.068
having no colour,

51:27.168 --> 51:29.519
that they take every one offered.

51:35.551 --> 51:38.496
Water often possesses colour

51:38.596 --> 51:41.823
but colour is not imparted
to its reflections...

51:42.808 --> 51:46.035
or refractions like a coloured glass

51:47.354 --> 51:52.125
when everything seen
is vitiated by that colour.

51:54.153 --> 51:57.973
Even the purest mirror
gives a tone to the sky

51:58.073 --> 52:00.309
and as the colour is increased,

52:00.409 --> 52:03.688
it destroys
all the colour of nature by its...

52:03.788 --> 52:06.065
by its own dullness,

52:06.165 --> 52:11.352
while water often seems
to challenge the sky for...

52:13.756 --> 52:16.174
brightness and...

52:16.759 --> 52:19.870
and when possessing colour...

52:19.970 --> 52:24.166
its reflections of objects
appear more possible.

52:24.266 --> 52:28.119
In short, their effects
are like their qualities.

52:29.104 --> 52:32.925
One repels the immediate ray.

52:33.025 --> 52:34.885
The other absorbs it.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.848
The one transparent while the mirror...

52:38.948 --> 52:41.257
is opa... is opaque.

52:47.581 --> 52:50.516
How can they appear the same?

53:51.020 --> 53:53.830
Daddy, cease your labour.
Go and sit in your chair.

53:54.690 --> 53:56.133
I can't leave this.

53:56.233 --> 53:59.460
It'll keep for the half-hour.
Go and peruse your newspaper.

54:06.535 --> 54:08.094
Do not stoop.

54:12.541 --> 54:14.308
Go and rest your bones.

55:01.924 --> 55:04.108
- What's occurring?
- He's struggling.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.496
Are you rattling?

55:07.596 --> 55:09.447
Come on, bring it up.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.747
No, indeed not, sir.

55:27.783 --> 55:32.470
I shall. I shall tell her.
I will tell her.

55:35.541 --> 55:38.434
I ought to have told her afore.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.990
- Years ago.
- Who do you speak of, Daddy?

55:43.090 --> 55:45.108
Afore they took her away.

55:46.427 --> 55:50.488
Eastertide, the good Lord
took her from us.

55:53.600 --> 55:58.663
We did not do right by her, poor woman.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.958
She was a lunatic.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.962
We didn't have no choice, Daddy.

56:08.073 --> 56:11.592
She made our life a living hell.

56:12.453 --> 56:17.348
She was your mother. Curse her!

56:19.626 --> 56:23.354
Show her due respect, boy.

56:24.465 --> 56:27.534
The bitch!

56:42.399 --> 56:44.584
My little lad.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.671
Daddy.

58:03.063 --> 58:05.716
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good day to you, madam.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.677
- It's been a long while, ain't it?
- Yeah.

58:08.777 --> 58:12.389
- May I offer you a refreshment?
- No, thank you kindly.

58:12.489 --> 58:15.017
- Champagne?
- No, no.

58:15.117 --> 58:17.019
No mind, sir,

58:17.119 --> 58:21.356
I regret all my lovely girls are occupied
but we do have young Eliza here

58:21.456 --> 58:24.902
who I do not believe
you've had the pleasure of previous.

58:26.879 --> 58:30.908
She has a pleasing countenance,
when she smiles.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.869
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you, miss.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.320
Show the gentleman
to your chamber, dear.

58:37.890 --> 58:39.532
It's this way, sir.

59:01.288 --> 59:03.139
Very fine.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.766
I do extras.

59:06.543 --> 59:08.362
No, no, no, no, no.

59:08.462 --> 59:10.313
Remove the bodice.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.780
Expose your breasts.

59:20.974 --> 59:22.835
No, no... no.

59:22.935 --> 59:24.660
Lay upon the bed.

59:30.192 --> 59:32.386
Part your legs.

59:32.486 --> 59:33.804
Crook your knee.

59:33.904 --> 59:35.838
Right arm as thus.

59:36.949 --> 59:40.343
Hand upon the head. No... as in despair.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.091
Yes.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:38.651
Eliza... or Liza?

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.445
Eliza.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.407
Or Liza.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:48.869
- Your age?
- Twenty-two, sir.

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.456
Twenty-two?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.059
Would you like something to drink, sir?

01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:00.649
No... thank you, miss.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.278
Now...

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:07.239
expose your breasts.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:49.114
- Good day, sir.
- Madam.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.116
- You be seeking lodgings?
- Indeed.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.326
Oh... I do know'ee.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:56.239
Er, Mr Duckworth.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:07:00.000
- Mallard.
- Oh, Mr Mallard. Of course!

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.918
Well, you be lucky. The room is free.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.045
- Splendid.
- Well, do come in.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:07.790
There. Oh, it be most pleasant
to see you again.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:20.145
Oh, Mr Mallard.
Everything satisfactory in your chamber?

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:21.271
Most agreeable.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.149
Good. Well, you sit there
and make yourself comfy.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:27.319
I expect you'll be tired
after your journey.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.447
Now, I have not poured your tea
for it is fresh in the pot.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.949
No matter. Suits me, brewed and stewed.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:38.455
Now, that I do remember, Mr Mallard.
And will you take a biscuit?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.875
No, thank you, madam.
I purchased a potato on the boat.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.878
I should think that were all
you could manage on the steamer.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:46.921
It was somewhat turbulent.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:49.466
I shall leave you
to take your refreshment.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:53.043
Madam, may I apprehend you
with my condolences?

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:56.431
I do thank you, sir.

01:07:56.531 --> 01:08:00.435
My sympathies, commiserations,
for the loss of your dear departed man.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.970
Well, he were a dear man.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:10.769
'Tis twice in my life now
I have found myself a widow.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:15.700
My first husband were taken from me
when I was but a young woman.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.368
How was he taken?

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:20.246
He were foying over there
on Goodwin Sands.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.575
- A life-saver.
- Aye. He did save many a life.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.130
But in the end...
he could not save his own.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.165
We never did find him, poor soul.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:37.846
My boy were eight year old
when he did lose his father.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.765
I was eight
when I lost my little sister.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.175
Oh? Oh, I am sorry.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.725
Well... 'tis the way of things.

01:08:56.883 --> 01:09:00.319
You still making
your nice little pictures, Mr Mallard?

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.575
There.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.107
Mr Billy.

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:35.103
Welcome home.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.231
Dirty water.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.202
Pleasant trip?

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.175
Your order came.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:59.012
- Did he send the cobalt blue?
- I put it in a jar.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.056
Chrome yellow, scarlet lake, lead white.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:05.185
- Canvases?
- He put 'em downstairs for me.

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:08.146
Two six-by-fours, three four-by-threes.

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:10.940
- Megilp?
- Next week.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.813
Was it a pleasant trip?

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:53.233
- Good morning, Mr Turner.
- Martin, Sir Billy, Gussy.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.610
- Good day to you, Billy.
- Delighted you could join us.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.946
Damn fine spectacle this year, Billy.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.784
A very fine day to you, Mr Stothard!

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.619
What? Oh!

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.653
Mr Turner, sir!

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.746
- Constable.
- Turner.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.138
- Jonesy, Carlo.
- William.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:25.598
The Hanging Committee.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.892
- You approve?
- 'Tis well hung.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.343
- Grazie.
- Prego.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.399
Would everything be
to your satisfaction, Mr Turner?

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:36.442
It is indeed, Mr President.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.071
- 'Tis a splendid cornucopia.
- Cornucopia!

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:43.491
- Good morning, Turner.
- Good morning to you, Mr Leslie.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.285
- Rabbie.
- Good morning, Mr Turner.

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:46.995
My other piece, where is it located?

01:11:47.095 --> 01:11:50.081
- We placed it in the anteroom.
- The anteroom.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.368
- Mr Carew!
- Turner!

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.664
- Stanny.
- Hello, Mr Turner, sir.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.094
- Is it for His Majesty?
- Indeed.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:06.546
- I hope it meets his expectations.
- It will.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:09.591
- Grout.
- Mr Turner.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:19.569
- Sir John Soane!
- J.M.W. Turner, esquire!

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.654
- As I live and breathe.
- My dear friend.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.364
Find yourself well, John?

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:25.241
- Relishing the day.
- Capital.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.577
Only now I was admiring your seascape.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.203
There she is.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:32.332
- Mr Pickersgill.
- Good morning, William.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.877
He has the air of despondency upon him.

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:38.296
- He is slighted.
- For why?

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:40.924
Yet again in the anteroom.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:44.761
They hang us where they will, Pickers.
Take a guzzle of brown sherry.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.639
Damn fine storm you have there, Billy.

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:50.423
Nimbus, Sir Billy, nimbus.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.098
Oh, beg your pardon, sir.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:22.674
- Carlo the Salamander.
- Amico mio.

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:25.385
- Harmony and unity, William
- Chemise.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.586
- Chemise?
- Lower.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.808
- Molto bene.
- Jonesy!

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.726
- I want you to see...
- What?

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.436
- Remember?
- Remind me.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.438
- Pisa.
- Oh, Pisa!

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.315
- Fine around there, Gussy.
- You think so?

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.391
Oh, yeah.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.146
- Nelson?
- With two arms.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.327
- Mr Leslie.
- Turner.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:55.947
Little maid, gamboge gown,
left foot instep, touch of highlight.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.084
Thank you, Turner.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.920
Paintings always benefit his remarks.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.798
Carew! This your man?

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:05.466
'Tis he.

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:08.219
Sports an elegant nostril,
does he not, Sir John?

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:11.264
- Splendid nostrils.
- Thank you kindly.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.473
What did you say?

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:15.101
Elegant pair of nostrils, Mr Stothard!

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:17.302
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.444
Why on earth would he go and do that?

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:10.156
Oh, I believe Mr Turner knows
well enough what he's doing, Sir Martin.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.492
Do you think so?

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:16.329
- He's ruined a masterpiece.
- I think not.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:18.915
That's too bad. That's too bad.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.085
He's been here and fired a gun.

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:24.212
Oh, no, no.

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:27.548
John, you must not upset
yourself like this.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.761
The man's impossible.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.597
I mean, why would he go
and destroy a perfectly good painting?

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.715
Sheer mockery.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.394
My sympathy is with Constable.

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:44.023
He's got a damn fine picture here
and he's made a damn mockery of it.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:46.859
There's method
in the madness, gentlemen.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.238
- If that is method, it is pure madness.
- But, what is it? Is it...

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:53.231
Oh, do stop that prattling laughter,
Mr Carew!

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:57.203
I wager we've not seen
the end of this, gentlemen.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:58.945
He may surprise us yet.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.657
Haydon.

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:04.576
Hey!

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:18.631
Mr Turner. We were just wondering if...

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:24.564
I said he wasn't finished.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.963
It's a buoy! Bravo!

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.257
Bravo! Marvellous!

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.389
Can you explain your rendition?

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.683
It needs no explanation, sir.

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.811
'Tis our Redeemer's conveyance
into Jerusalem, plain as day.

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:05.479
Blasphemy!

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.231
You faring well, Mr Haydon?

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:11.101
- This will be the finish of me!
- 50 pounds!

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.747
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir, for your charity.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:25.124
- Haydon?
- You have been most kind.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.376
Most kind in your placement.
You have finished me.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.630
You might as well have taken my painting
and put it in the outhouse.

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:33.007
Better yet, taken it out of this building
and thrown it in the Fleet.

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:35.426
Haydon, I am hard... hard set

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.511
- to understand your indignation.
- And as for you, my pupil...

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:40.640
Your painting, sir, is hanging
next-door to that of Mr Turner.

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.309
- It is in fine company.
- This is treachery!

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:46.395
- And do not talk to me of Turner's work.
- Please lower your voice, Mr Haydon.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.689
His pictures look as if they were painted
by somebody born without hands!

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.441
Mr Haydon, what is your quarrel?

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.069
What principles have you applied
other than those that I gave?

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:56.239
- Mr Haydon, please lower your voice.
- I will not, sir!

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.574
- What is your quarrel here?
- I have no respect for you.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.702
I certainly do not acknowledge
your presidency.

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:03.037
It should have been Wilkie.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:06.749
Mr Haydon, I will not have personal
attacks like this on the Academy floor.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.542
You will have
what I choose to give you, sir.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.086
This would be one of the many reasons

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.671
why you were never accepted here,
Mr Haydon.

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:14.257
This man... this man has spent
a quarter of a century

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.217
doing everything in his power
to malign me...

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:18.594
- I have done nothing of the sort.
- ...and spoil my genius.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.554
- Refrain from this shouting, Mr Haydon.
- I will not!

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.807
- I will have you forcibly removed.
- Yes, do it!

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.268
Do it! Remove me
from your nest of portrait painters!

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:26.310
Have a care!

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.062
What, sir, is wrong
with being a portrait painter?

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:29.689
What does it do to elevate the art?

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.108
I received the accolade
from the King for painting portraits.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.694
- Oh, God! I bow to him!
- And damn good ones too, sir!

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:38.739
Haydon, can I point out
that I, too, hang in the inferior chamber?

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:40.992
I care not for your work, sir.
I care not a fig.

01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:44.912
At least my work does not represent
self-portrait as ass.

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:46.812
Give me those...

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:53.254
- Unhand me!
- Remove this man!

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.840
You swines! You swines!

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.467
Mr Haydon, sir,
with deep regret I must inform you

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.928
that I am on my way to the porters,

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.264
unless you feel free to leave
of your own volition.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.175
Please, sir.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.763
Stretch me no longer
on this rough world.

01:19:13.791 --> 01:19:15.725
I'm done with you.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.532
'Tis nice to have a bit of company
for a change.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:29.452
So you had a good walk, then?
Weren't too chippy up there by Reculver?

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:32.997
Somewhat blowy and the wind
did kick up some white horses.

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:34.832
Can do this time of year.

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:37.001
In summertime, though,
'tis a lovely calm spot for a picnic

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.502
up there by the Two Sisters,

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.922
but in wintertime I have known
the whole of Marine Terrace down here

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:45.301
without a pane of glass left
in the entire place.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.669
Oh, the glaziers do get rich.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.557
When Mr Booth and I moved in here,
we had the whole place polished up,

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.976
spick and span,
ready for our first visitors

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:56.770
and the wind did blow
and the sea come up.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.064
We had broken glass everywhere.
It were terrible.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.484
Mrs Booth.

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.935
Would you be so kind
as to look out of the window?

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.073
Where? What am I looking at?

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.401
From the tip of your nose to the bridge
to the curve of your brow

01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:16.948
you put me in mind of a Greek sculpture
I'm familiar with, of Aphrodite,

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:19.784
the goddess of love.

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:23.506
Oh, now!

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:25.674
No one's ever said that
about my nose before.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.999
This old snout!

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:34.308
Truth to tell,
my eyes aren't so good these days

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:38.604
so when I do look in the looking-glass
I be glad I cannot see so well.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:42.640
When I peruse myself in the looking-glass,
I see a gargoyle.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.486
Now, you be fishing for compliments,

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:49.365
and my old ma used to say, them
what fish for compliments don't get none.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:53.067
Besides, 'tis what's within a person
that do matter.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:57.655
I do not know you, Mr Mallard,

01:22:59.058 --> 01:23:04.078
and I'm sure there be things about you
that are beyond my understanding,

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:07.758
but I believe you to be...

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:12.044
a man of great... spirit
and fine feeling.

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:18.593
Mrs Booth...

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:23.723
you are a woman of profound beauty.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.187
Mr Mallard...

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:37.361
I am lost for words.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.441
Good night, Mr Mallard, sir.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.568
I've cleaned your boots for'ee.

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:09.602
They're by the door here.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:14.398
Mrs Booth.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:19.997
I thank you
for a most convivial evening.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.031
I do thank you too, sir.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:01.380
If I may be so bold as to say, mate,

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:04.926
as I see it,

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.063
you're a loose cannon
rolling round the deck.

01:26:54.585 --> 01:26:55.778
And out.

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:01.325
Cover yourself up.

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:02.743
Good man.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:06.455
Well, Mr Mallard
is suffering from bronchitis.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.123
Oh... there.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.542
For which we prescribe the three Bs:

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:13.086
- bed, balsam and broth.
- Oh.

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:17.090
To be administered in this case
by the fourth B: the admirable Mrs Booth.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:18.550
- Oh!
- Thank you.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:22.387
Now, Mrs Booth, if you would be so good
as to come up to the house after four,

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:23.931
I shall have the balsam prepared.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:26.558
- Indeed I shall, sir.
- Good day, Mr Mallard.

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:29.311
Rest the body, sir,
and the soul shall find solace.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.105
I do thank ye, Doctor.
Let me show ye out.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:34.399
- Good day to you, Mrs Booth.
- Good day to you, sir.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:00.884
Gentlemen.

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:02.845
Mr Turner.

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:07.099
My father and I are marvelling
at this glorious work.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:09.810
Er... might I be correct in remembering

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:13.522
that we had the good fortune of viewing it
at the Academy last summer?

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.731
Indeed.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:18.861
Well, I must say, it is no less impressive
on its second viewing.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:21.905
Perhaps even more so. Is it not, Father?

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:23.198
Indeed so.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:26.451
I recall it provoked
much heated and stimulating discussion

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.537
long after our viewing.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:31.415
- It did not sell.
- Indeed not?

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.500
No, Mr Ruskin.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.545
- I'm astonished.
- But it is a masterpiece.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.506
- Thackeray reviles it.
- How so?

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:43.176
- Sublime or ridiculous, he says.
- Well, perhaps he should make up his mind.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.845
He has a sharp and cynical tongue.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.348
There is no place for cynicism
in the reviewing of art.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.769
- 'Tis of no consequence.
- Quite.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:54.929
It is purchasable.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.774
Enticing.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:28:59.850
Perhaps.

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:06.992
Typhus epidemic amongst the cargo,
slaves die on board, no insurance.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:10.621
Sling 'em in the drink,
drowned dead, cash.

01:29:10.721 --> 01:29:13.582
I am struck by the column
of bright white,

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:16.919
placed precisely off centre here,

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:20.756
applied over the darkened background,
impasto,

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:26.053
contrasting with the scarlet and ochre hues
in the upper left corner,

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:29.598
which in turn contrasts
with the presence of God,

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:33.143
revealing to us that hope exists

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:36.521
even in the most turbulent
and illimitable of deaths.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:38.139
Bluebottles.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:42.393
- Eh?
- Up in the muslin. Knock 'em out.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:45.813
Well, I didn't put 'em there.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:53.705
Would it not sit splendidly
above the fireplace in the library, Father?

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:57.542
It would, but I fear
it may be beyond our purse, John.

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.119
I'm sure some arrangement
can be come to, sir.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.330
Mind your heads.

01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:07.010
You're just...
you're just knocking 'em up and down.

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.762
Scrape 'em out.

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.338
Now you've...
Now you've knocked it over there.

01:30:48.819 --> 01:30:50.878
There. 'Tis a nice day for'ee.

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.600
Au revoir, madame.

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:02.681
T'other way.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:06.101
- Morning, Mrs Stokes.
- Morning.

01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:41.146
Dr Price, Mrs Booth has summoned you here
under false pretences.

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:42.898
Let the doctor do his work.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:44.390
Breathe in.

01:31:45.876 --> 01:31:47.590
Breathe out.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.739
Have you been exerting yourself
unduly, Mr Mallard?

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:52.616
No more than is usual, sir.

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:54.608
Remind me again,
what is your profession?

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:58.872
- Master of Chancery.
- Breathe in.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:01.166
Forgive me, sir, but I beg to differ.

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:02.733
Breathe out.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:07.380
I suggest that you are Mr Turner,
the illustrious painter,

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.833
and I am greatly honoured
to make your acquaintance.

01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:13.261
My apologies to you both,

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:16.223
but rest assured
that my discretion can be relied upon.

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:20.894
Now, allow me to examine your eyes.

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:23.814
The eyes of a master.

01:32:23.914 --> 01:32:25.431
Open wide.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:29.935
Look up.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:37.401
Mr Turner, you are suffering
from a disorder of the heart.

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:40.914
There is no immediate
cause for concern, Mrs Booth.

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:42.999
- But he will have to be careful.
- Oh, dear.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:48.505
Live moderately, sir, and you shall enjoy
a long and fruitful life.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:52.801
Exert yourself unduly
and you will go to an early grave.

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:54.835
Oh, dear.

01:32:56.238 --> 01:32:57.338
There, now.

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:17.066
Good day, sir.

01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:21.904
Have you nothing to say to me?

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.784
I am most sorry for your loss.

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.880
Our loss, Father!

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.257
Your own dear daughter's funeral.

01:33:32.357 --> 01:33:33.916
Indeed.

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:39.681
I did not find myself in the city.

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:44.352
As ever, sir,
painting your ridiculous shipwrecks.

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:49.390
Have you no feelings?

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:52.976
Speak!

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:01.203
Come, Evelina.

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:04.154
There is nothing here for us.

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:55.289
You're tired, my dear.

01:34:58.651 --> 01:35:01.554
'Tis too much of a strain
for you these days,

01:35:01.654 --> 01:35:06.091
trawling back and forth on that old steamer
every time you wants to see me.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:11.064
And even when they've finished
building that new railway,

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:14.099
we none of us do know what lies ahead.

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.906
I have bethought me of a plan

01:35:20.006 --> 01:35:22.659
and here is what we must do.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.452
If you will find a little house for us,

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:29.072
somewhere by your beloved River Thames,
but not too far from London Town,

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:31.918
with good, solid, wooden floors,

01:35:32.018 --> 01:35:34.536
nice bright light for you to work by...

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:37.915
then I will buy the lease.

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:43.587
I can sell this house.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.892
I think we would be happy,

01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:49.602
the two of us.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.904
There she is.

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:03.700
- The saucy Temeraire.
- Going to her death, I fear.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.201
She's served her time.

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:07.996
The auctioneer's hammer
has struck that final blow.

01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:09.539
Indeed.

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:12.834
If not for her, the Victory might
never again have seen our shores.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.919
Aye, nor the body of Lord Nelson.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.964
The little saviour of Trafalgar.

01:36:18.064 --> 01:36:22.344
They say 5,000 oaks
went into making that ship.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:25.847
Now she's destined to be reduced
to 5,000 tables and chairs.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:28.892
To be sat on by 5,000 fat arses.

01:36:30.994 --> 01:36:32.479
Gentlemen, a toast.

01:36:32.579 --> 01:36:36.733
Raise your pot of grog.
To the fine, fighting Temeraire!

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:39.235
- The Temeraire!
- The Temeraire!

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:40.978
Here's to her.

01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:45.524
- A ghost of the past.
- No, Rabbie.

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:49.278
The past is the past.
We're observing the future.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:54.074
Smoke, iron, steam.

01:36:55.226 --> 01:36:57.212
She'd make a fine subject
for you to paint, Turner.

01:36:57.312 --> 01:37:01.164
Oh, is that so, Stanny?
I shall cogitate upon it.

01:37:02.025 --> 01:37:03.843
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:15.188
It's that Mr Haydon.

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:21.643
He's brought a cold blast of air
in with him.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:33.081
Mr Haydon, to what do I owe the honour
of your presence this morning?

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:36.835
I trust that this is not
an inconvenience to you, Turner.

01:37:36.935 --> 01:37:40.547
Now, will you accept ten pounds?

01:37:40.647 --> 01:37:43.383
- Ten pounds, sir?
- I wish to be free of the debt.

01:37:43.483 --> 01:37:47.178
- It weighs heavily upon me.
- Sir, you owe me 50 pounds.

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:51.975
Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle.
I have been giving my lecture.

01:37:52.075 --> 01:37:54.269
Edinburgh, fair city.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:57.137
Only in London
is my genius not appreciated.

01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:00.733
Consider this as a statement of intent.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:03.736
- Mr Haydon, pray be seated.
- I had rather not.

01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:05.989
I do not wish to prevail upon your time
more than is necessary.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:08.357
And I prevail upon you, sir,
to take a seat.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.611
- Where would you have me sit?
- Wherever you wish.

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.459
- Will this suffice?
- Indeed.

01:38:17.559 --> 01:38:20.545
Mr Haydon, do you still find yourself
in a position of impecuniousness?

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:25.791
Impecunity? Turner, that has been
my constant state these 30 years.

01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:29.461
You are most well-appointed here.

01:38:30.113 --> 01:38:34.601
I do not recall the last time
we had as much coal in our scuttle as that.

01:38:34.701 --> 01:38:37.312
I fear we shall be burning
our furniture this winter.

01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:39.689
Does Mrs Haydon
find herself faring well?

01:38:39.789 --> 01:38:43.318
She does not. She has not recovered.

01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:45.612
I fear that she may never do so.

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:47.646
What ails her, sir?

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:50.482
We have buried five children.

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:54.996
- Indeed?
- In Paddington old churchyard

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:57.999
they remove the soil,
extract the coffins,

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.375
dig the hole deeper,

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:03.296
then reinter the coffins
with another atop.

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:06.341
Five times
she has had to suffer that indignity.

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:09.418
- 'Tis pitiable.
- It is pitiable, Turner.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:12.003
You have never had to endure
the loss of a child.

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:14.891
I have not, sir.

01:39:14.991 --> 01:39:16.893
A dying child,

01:39:16.993 --> 01:39:19.678
'tis a potent subject
for a painting, is it not?

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:23.858
And what is your
present endeavour, Turner?

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:27.894
- Er... marine piece.
- A marine piece?

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:31.773
Do not you tire of boats
and the fiery firmament?

01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:33.984
I do not, sir.

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:38.331
Sometimes I consider
it might make a better course for me

01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:40.532
were I to set light to the house

01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:45.547
with my wife, my surviving children
and myself within it.

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:47.914
Then they would no longer
be saddled with me.

01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:52.085
Your pain is your own, sir.
Do not inflict it upon your loved ones.

01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:56.423
Will you take my ten pounds?

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:01.813
I will not, sir.
You are free of your debt.

01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:04.440
- Free? How so?
- 'Tis expunged.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:07.569
Er... no, sir. I do not come here
a seeker after charity or pity.

01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:10.029
You have neither charity
nor pity nor debt.

01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:12.031
I do not wish it in such a circumstance.

01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:15.243
Mr Haydon, I am much preoccupied.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:18.162
Me damsel, be so kind as to escort
the gentleman into the street.

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:19.956
Good day to you, sir.

01:40:20.056 --> 01:40:22.616
This does not sit well with me, Turner.

01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:28.298
Damn his eyes.

01:40:46.708 --> 01:40:49.861
- Turner and Jones.
- Mr Turner, Captain Jones.

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:52.113
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Mr Ruskin!

01:40:52.213 --> 01:40:53.281
Good evening to you.

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:54.699
I trust you had a pleasant journey?

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:56.492
Indeed. You find yourself well, sir?

01:40:56.592 --> 01:40:59.662
I do indeed, thank you.
Pride of place, Mr Turner.

01:40:59.762 --> 01:41:00.913
Splendid.

01:41:01.013 --> 01:41:03.249
As though the house was built around it.

01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:05.951
- Please, come through.
- Jonesy.

01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:11.883
Er, my good husband is of the opinion

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:15.303
that the gooseberry
prefers the colder climate,

01:41:15.403 --> 01:41:18.890
whereas I consider
that all fruits benefit from the warmth.

01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:23.353
My dear late mother always insisted
that both the gooseberry and the rhubarb

01:41:23.453 --> 01:41:26.314
favour the colder climes
of our victorious isles.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:31.059
I do not doubt that the gooseberry
for its preference may enjoy the warm,

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:36.282
however I am convinced that a cold start
promotes the more vigorous specimen.

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:38.826
Are we not to take as empirical evidence

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:43.122
our many expeditions to the warmer
climes of the Mediterranean

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:46.876
where we do not exactly encounter
an abundance of gooseberries?

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:49.629
- Ha! Indeed.
- Exactly so.

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:52.006
I did not myself savour
many gooseberries in Jerusalem.

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:54.759
The holy city, Mr Turner.

01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:58.221
And yet we do enjoy
fine gooseberries in Scotland,

01:41:58.321 --> 01:41:59.514
do we not, Mr Ruskin?

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:02.591
Aye, and no better a cold start
than a good Scottish sun.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:04.811
Exactly that.

01:42:04.911 --> 01:42:09.524
Surely, regardless of how cold the start
of the life of the gooseberry might be,

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:12.485
it is almost certainly destined
for a warm ending.

01:42:12.585 --> 01:42:16.698
To which we have all borne witness
in Mrs Ruskin's excellent gooseberry pie.

01:42:17.377 --> 01:42:19.784
I thank you, Captain Jones.

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:23.287
May I propose as a topic for discussion

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:27.166
the question as to the depiction
of the seas and the oceans

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:28.793
in pictorial art?

01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:33.089
Now, I appreciate that I am honoured

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:37.719
to be in the presence of two of our
most distinguished marine painters,

01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:41.180
Mr Turner and Mr Stanfield,

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.560
not to forget Captain Jones
and Mr Roberts, of course,

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:50.314
whose realisations are confined
to mere naked terra firma,

01:42:50.414 --> 01:42:52.066
exemplary though they are.

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:56.863
My point being that, alas,

01:42:56.963 --> 01:43:01.743
I find myself harbouring
a perhaps rather controversial opinion

01:43:01.843 --> 01:43:04.162
regarding the long deceased Claude.

01:43:04.262 --> 01:43:08.166
- Indeed?
- I am afraid so, Captain Jones.

01:43:08.266 --> 01:43:10.168
I must confess

01:43:10.268 --> 01:43:16.048
that I find his rendering of the sea
rather insipid, dull and uninspiring.

01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:18.968
That is an extremely bold statement,
young Mr Ruskin.

01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:20.720
Thank you very much.

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.722
Claude was a man of his time.

01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:25.141
My point exactly, Mr Turner,

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.769
but that time is now long past.

01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:31.606
When I experience
a modern masterpiece such as yours,

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:35.860
I am struck by the clarity
with which you have captured the moment.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.279
Take, for example, your slave ship,

01:43:38.379 --> 01:43:42.617
"Slavers Throwing Overboard
the Dead and Dying - Typhoon Coming On",

01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:45.578
by which I have the good fortune
to be greeted every morning

01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:48.039
on my way into my meagre breakfast.

01:43:48.139 --> 01:43:52.627
The impact of the foaming
brine incarnadine

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:56.672
consuming those unfortunate Negro slaves

01:43:56.772 --> 01:44:00.635
never ceases to quicken
the beat of my heart.

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:04.555
Yet when I gaze upon a work of Claude

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:06.891
I find myself enduring nothing more

01:44:06.991 --> 01:44:10.186
than a mere collection
of precise brushstrokes

01:44:10.286 --> 01:44:13.356
which instil in me
no sense of awe whatsoever,

01:44:13.456 --> 01:44:14.899
let alone the sea.

01:44:14.999 --> 01:44:16.599
Preposterous!

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:19.644
I do beg your pardon, Mrs Ruskin.

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:24.033
- Claude Lorrain was a genius.
- Quite so.

01:44:24.133 --> 01:44:28.454
I sense an excess of modesty in Mr Turner
and there is no need for such humility.

01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:30.414
Mr Ruskin, sir,

01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:35.628
to conjecture upon the matter
of seascape painting is one thing

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:38.381
but to stand amongst the elements

01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:43.594
and to experience
and to interpret what one sees

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.137
is something quite other.

01:44:45.237 --> 01:44:47.014
- Hear, hear.
- Quite.

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:48.641
That is as it may be.

01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:53.145
Claude painted from the land,
looking at the sea becalmed by the harbour.

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:55.930
- Oh, indeed.
- "Bless the Lord, oh my soul

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:59.652
"Who layeth the beams
of his chambers in the waters

01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:02.280
"and walketh
upon the wings of the wind."

01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:03.906
How apt, Mother.

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:05.324
Thank you, John.

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:09.110
When my son was but a small boy,

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.331
he was overheard to remark that...

01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:15.710
"waves of sea are indeed lovely to watch

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:18.296
"but they are always coming or gone,

01:45:18.396 --> 01:45:20.590
"never in any taken shape to be seen..."

01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:22.457
- For a second.
- "...a second."

01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:28.014
I find myself marvelling
at my own wealth of perception,

01:45:28.114 --> 01:45:30.131
even at the early age of four.

01:45:30.616 --> 01:45:31.851
Quite so.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:36.314
Mr Ruskin, can I pose you
a somewhat conundrous question?

01:45:36.414 --> 01:45:38.348
Please do, Mr Turner.

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:43.779
To which do you find yourself
the more partial,

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:48.492
a... steak and kidney pie
or a veal and ham pie?

01:45:52.513 --> 01:45:54.790
I must confess, Mr Turner,

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:58.002
that I find myself quite unable
to answer your question

01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:00.870
with the precision that I would wish.

01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:15.945
Your Majesty.

01:47:37.827 --> 01:47:39.677
Terribly flat.

01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:43.473
- Dull.
- It's rather dark, isn't it?

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.861
- Sir Martin.
- Sir?

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:50.521
- Who is the artist?
- I believe, sir, it's...

01:47:56.137 --> 01:47:58.080
Mr John Ferneley, sir.

01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.490
Oh, Mr Ferneley.

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:24.440
Turner.

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.100
He is clearly losing his eyesight.

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.855
And this one is vile.

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:37.703
Unbelievable.

01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:39.914
- What it that?
- I don't know.

01:48:40.014 --> 01:48:42.573
A dirty, yellow mess.

01:48:53.569 --> 01:48:56.347
It is a truly frightful piece.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:59.433
It is indicative of mental disease.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:01.843
It is wretched and abortive.

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:07.473
Sad.

01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:12.238
Mr Turner seems
to have taken leave of form altogether.

01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:14.949
He has on former occasion
chosen to paint

01:49:15.049 --> 01:49:19.578
with cream or chocolate,
yolk of egg or currant jelly.

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:23.958
But here he uses
his whole array of kitchen stuff.

01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:28.703
- Eggs and spinach.
- No, soap suds and whitewash.

01:49:29.855 --> 01:49:33.259
Jam tarts! Jam tarts! Fresh jam tarts!

01:49:43.202 --> 01:49:44.979
Where is that wretched baker's boy?

01:49:45.079 --> 01:49:46.939
His fate, I fear, he won't enjoy.

01:49:47.039 --> 01:49:49.191
He will indeed the lad destroy!

01:49:50.334 --> 01:49:52.111
I have an inspiration.

01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:54.989
- What's that?
- We're filled with fascination.

01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:57.575
- What is he doing?
- And why is he doing it?

01:49:57.675 --> 01:50:00.619
Whatever he's brewing,
we'll soon be viewing it.

01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:05.416
A masterpiece I here present
which Mr Turner has just sent.

01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:12.006
While mostly blessed
with good intent, we have our doubts.

01:50:12.106 --> 01:50:14.300
But who's this gent?

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.428
Ye common throng and hoi polloi,

01:50:17.528 --> 01:50:20.139
I am a rich and cultured boy.

01:50:20.239 --> 01:50:23.392
My wealth derives from tricking knaves

01:50:23.492 --> 01:50:25.978
and selling coffee, tea and slaves.

01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:28.981
My house is full of things of beauty,

01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:31.942
paintings, sculpture and other booty.

01:50:32.042 --> 01:50:35.270
I like to drink and gourmandise...

01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:37.198
But what is this that greets my eyes?

01:50:37.298 --> 01:50:38.991
It is the latest thing in art.

01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:41.410
It looks like bits of old jam tart.

01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:46.498
'Tis Mr Turner's latest piece,
which placed above your mantelpiece...

01:50:46.598 --> 01:50:49.376
Oh, cease your costermonger sounds!

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:51.077
I'll buy it.

01:50:52.146 --> 01:50:56.383
- Here's 1,000 pounds.
- Oh, I thank you in my humble way.

01:50:56.483 --> 01:51:00.387
- Don't grovel, send it round today.
- I'll do so, sir, without delay.

01:51:00.487 --> 01:51:03.881
Rejoice! Hurrah! Hip, hip, hooray!

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:06.602
Though ignorant of art and taste,

01:51:06.702 --> 01:51:08.812
I'm filled with boundless glee,

01:51:08.912 --> 01:51:12.849
for what's good enough for Turner...
is good enough for me!

01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:57.778
Mr Ruskin, I fail to see
wherein lies the charity

01:51:57.878 --> 01:52:00.781
in misleading people
as to the amount of talents they possess.

01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:02.574
Talent is something that lies dormant

01:52:02.674 --> 01:52:04.994
and needs to be drawn out
in the right circumstances.

01:52:05.094 --> 01:52:07.663
If one has the opportunity
to have it drawn out.

01:52:07.763 --> 01:52:10.874
My wife, Effie,

01:52:10.974 --> 01:52:14.878
I am still waiting for her talents
to arise and be drawn out.

01:52:14.978 --> 01:52:18.257
I think talents can be crushed
as much as they may be drawn out.

01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:19.425
Precisely.

01:52:19.525 --> 01:52:20.759
Perhaps it is the duty of the husband...

01:52:20.859 --> 01:52:25.338
Plutarch said,
"Painting is silent poetry."

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:43.657
Are you interested in poetry, sir?

01:52:43.757 --> 01:52:46.567
Sublime.

01:52:52.975 --> 01:52:54.367
Loneliness...

01:52:56.770 --> 01:52:58.871
solitude...

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:02.375
'tis not the same.

01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:06.921
Indeed not, Mr Turner.

01:53:07.948 --> 01:53:09.757
It will come.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.846
Mrs Ruskin... it will come.

01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:19.517
Love.

01:53:34.683 --> 01:53:36.251
What is the hour?

01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:38.712
- Five-and-twenty to seven.
- Oh.

01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:40.413
Oh, God!

01:53:50.949 --> 01:53:53.508
The sun's up in all its glory.

01:53:54.453 --> 01:53:56.387
I must get on.

01:54:16.725 --> 01:54:19.660
- Don't you want your breakfast?
- No, thank you kindly.

01:54:24.983 --> 01:54:27.136
Are you faring well?

01:54:27.236 --> 01:54:29.295
Yes, thank you.

01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:33.341
- And yourself?
- Yes, yes.

01:54:36.036 --> 01:54:38.397
Will I be seeing you tonight?

01:54:38.497 --> 01:54:40.806
- Unlikely.
- Tomorrow?

01:54:42.417 --> 01:54:44.602
- No.
- Oh.

01:54:48.382 --> 01:54:51.651
I might as well stop
changing the bed sheets in here.

01:55:21.373 --> 01:55:22.973
Mr Booth!

01:55:46.982 --> 01:55:48.541
Good day to you.

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:02.680
- 'Tis warmer now.
- Sultry day.

01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:09.154
- Ooh, what d'you have there?
- Bit of drift bark.

01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:13.232
Has the look of a fallen angel.

01:56:14.301 --> 01:56:16.944
Pretty colours.

01:56:20.432 --> 01:56:22.167
Oh! Sticky.

01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:26.829
Horrid parched.

01:57:01.098 --> 01:57:04.126
- Good morning, sir.
- A very good day to you, sir.

01:57:04.226 --> 01:57:06.243
Nice day, sir.

01:57:13.443 --> 01:57:15.262
Good morning, sir.

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:17.180
Greetings and welcome.

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.932
A hearty good morning to you, sir.

01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:21.935
- Now, you would be Mr...
- Mr Booth.

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:24.896
Booth, yes. Mr Booth.

01:57:24.996 --> 01:57:27.733
- At the appointed hour, I believe.
- Indeed, sir.

01:57:27.833 --> 01:57:29.443
Mayall, John Mayall.

01:57:29.543 --> 01:57:31.403
I had made that assumption, sir.

01:57:31.503 --> 01:57:33.655
At your service, Mr Booth.

01:57:33.755 --> 01:57:37.409
Now, if you would be so kind
as to make yourself comfortable...

01:57:37.509 --> 01:57:39.995
- This is the contraption?
- Indeed, sir.

01:57:40.095 --> 01:57:42.404
That is what we call the camera.

01:57:43.223 --> 01:57:45.584
- The cam-ra?
- Yes, sir.

01:57:45.684 --> 01:57:47.085
Not the cam-er?

01:57:47.185 --> 01:57:49.921
Er... no, sir. The camera.

01:57:50.021 --> 01:57:51.965
- The camera?
- Yes, sir.

01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:54.176
As in camera obscura?

01:57:54.276 --> 01:57:57.220
Precisely, sir. The camera.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.098
Now, if I may ask you
to take a seat, please, here.

01:58:00.198 --> 01:58:02.392
- Name of manufacturer?
- Er...

01:58:02.492 --> 01:58:04.645
It comes to us
from the United States, sir.

01:58:04.745 --> 01:58:06.688
The name eludes you?

01:58:06.788 --> 01:58:08.514
Oh, no, sir.

01:58:09.291 --> 01:58:12.402
My name eludes me from time to time.

01:58:12.502 --> 01:58:14.395
Indeed, sir?

01:58:15.464 --> 01:58:16.615
Now...

01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:29.294
I denote from your brogue
that you hail from the Americas.

01:58:29.394 --> 01:58:31.630
From the fine city of Philadelphia, sir.

01:58:31.730 --> 01:58:34.466
Philadelphia?
'Tis on the eastern coast, is it not?

01:58:34.566 --> 01:58:35.842
That is correct, sir.

01:58:37.277 --> 01:58:40.764
You shall have to forgive
the whip-crack of my knees.

01:58:40.864 --> 01:58:45.134
- Hat on or hat off?
- Er... may I ask your profession, sir?

01:58:45.786 --> 01:58:47.521
Master of Chancery.

01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:50.232
- A man of the law.
- Indeed.

01:58:50.332 --> 01:58:53.819
Then I should recommend the hat on, sir.

01:58:53.919 --> 01:58:57.322
Now, if I might deploy this device...

01:58:57.422 --> 01:58:59.315
Hey!

01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:01.702
What is this heinous implement?

01:59:01.802 --> 01:59:04.079
Merely a gentle holding brace, sir.

01:59:04.179 --> 01:59:06.155
Puts me in mind
of a surgical instrument.

01:59:06.598 --> 01:59:08.959
- Does it hurt?
- Not in the slightest, I assure you.

01:59:09.059 --> 01:59:11.532
So, if I may...

01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:17.008
Not too uncomfortable for you, Mr Booth?

01:59:18.568 --> 01:59:19.594
Thank you, sir.

01:59:19.694 --> 01:59:22.431
What is the significance
of the looking-glass?

01:59:22.531 --> 01:59:26.675
It is to illuminate your good self, sir.

01:59:29.287 --> 01:59:30.939
As the sun upon a lake.

01:59:31.039 --> 01:59:34.693
Oh! Most droll, Mr Booth.

01:59:34.793 --> 01:59:36.027
Most droll.

01:59:38.922 --> 01:59:42.492
What is concealed
behind the small brass cap?

01:59:42.592 --> 01:59:46.872
- An optic?
- Yes, sir, a glass lens.

01:59:46.972 --> 01:59:48.405
As a telescope?

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:51.626
Not unlike a telescope, sir.

01:59:51.726 --> 01:59:53.336
Thank you, Cornelius.

01:59:53.436 --> 01:59:56.298
- It is prismatic?
- I fear not, sir.

01:59:56.398 --> 01:59:59.050
- It is an achromatic lens.
- Achromatic.

01:59:59.150 --> 02:00:01.669
Now, let me peruse you.

02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:06.767
Why are you shrouded
in the manner of a condemned monk?

02:00:06.867 --> 02:00:09.802
I am simply shutting out the light,
Mr Booth.

02:00:11.288 --> 02:00:13.607
Splendid, sir.

02:00:13.707 --> 02:00:16.359
The image you create is not of colour.

02:00:16.459 --> 02:00:17.778
For why?

02:00:17.878 --> 02:00:21.615
Er... I am afraid that is a question
we have yet to answer, sir.

02:00:21.715 --> 02:00:23.658
It is a mystery.

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:25.035
Thank you, Cornelius.

02:00:25.135 --> 02:00:27.621
And long may it remain so.

02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:32.375
Now, if I may ask you
to focus your gaze here, on the flowers,

02:00:32.475 --> 02:00:35.086
and we are almost ready.

02:00:35.186 --> 02:00:36.838
Thank you, Cornelius.

02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:42.636
Now...

02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:47.798
I will require your absolute stillness
for the next ten seconds.

02:00:51.703 --> 02:00:54.179
And... we begin.

02:01:14.392 --> 02:01:16.503
And there we have it.

02:01:16.603 --> 02:01:20.164
- 'Tis done?
- It is finished, sir.

02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:23.718
I fear that I, too, am finished.

02:01:23.818 --> 02:01:25.679
Oh, come, come, sir.

02:01:29.157 --> 02:01:30.892
This be one of them there photographs.

02:01:32.035 --> 02:01:34.312
The Queen had one of these taken
with Prince Albert.

02:01:34.412 --> 02:01:36.439
- Did she so?
- She did.

02:01:38.541 --> 02:01:41.111
Oh, you do look most handsome.

02:01:41.211 --> 02:01:43.353
- 'Tis known as a daguerreotype.
- Oh.

02:01:44.381 --> 02:01:45.898
Whatever next?

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.411
- Where'd you have this done, then?
- Up in town on the Strand.

02:01:49.511 --> 02:01:51.111
Fellow with a box.

02:01:56.935 --> 02:01:58.670
- We're going there.
- Where?

02:01:58.770 --> 02:02:00.881
- Have our likeness taken.
- When?

02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:03.008
- Thursday.
- Oh.

02:02:03.108 --> 02:02:05.343
I've arranged an appointment.

02:02:05.443 --> 02:02:07.846
- Well, you'll have to cancel it.
- 'Tis painless.

02:02:07.946 --> 02:02:09.723
Oh, I care not.

02:02:09.823 --> 02:02:11.975
You don't want my old face
in one of these.

02:02:12.075 --> 02:02:14.676
I do, the two of us together.

02:02:15.495 --> 02:02:17.137
Forever.

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:22.226
I do thank you for this.

02:02:23.003 --> 02:02:24.937
But I ain't going.

02:02:29.467 --> 02:02:31.318
'Tis the camera.

02:02:32.804 --> 02:02:35.498
Mr Mayall, may I beg your indulgence
with a question?

02:02:35.598 --> 02:02:36.875
Why, certainly, sir.

02:02:36.975 --> 02:02:38.877
Do you take landscapes
with your contraption?

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:41.963
- I do, sir, from time to time.
- Such as what?

02:02:42.063 --> 02:02:45.207
Why, I have recorded
the great falls of Niagara, sir.

02:02:46.151 --> 02:02:48.762
- The Niagara Falls?
- Indeed, sir.

02:02:48.862 --> 02:02:51.014
The greatest wonder in nature.

02:02:51.114 --> 02:02:54.883
It was there that I was once able
to capture a rainbow.

02:02:56.453 --> 02:02:58.470
I'm green-eyed with envy.

02:02:59.497 --> 02:03:01.431
The Niagara Falls...

02:03:02.042 --> 02:03:05.779
is a natural phenomenon
that I have long desired to witness.

02:03:05.879 --> 02:03:07.530
Is that so, sir?

02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:11.326
Now, madam, sir,
if I may ask you to fix your gaze here

02:03:11.426 --> 02:03:13.411
upon these beautiful flowers.

02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:15.121
Thank you, Cornelius.

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:16.738
Niagara Falls.

02:03:18.558 --> 02:03:21.419
Soon painters will go about the world

02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:24.381
with a box, like a tinker,

02:03:24.481 --> 02:03:27.509
instead of a portfolio under their arms.

02:03:27.609 --> 02:03:30.762
Well, I'm sure they will, sir.
I'm sure they will.

02:03:32.113 --> 02:03:36.184
Now, if you are comfortable, madam, sir,

02:03:36.284 --> 02:03:38.635
we may proceed.

02:04:11.361 --> 02:04:13.378
- Thank you, miss.
- Thank you, sir.

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.347
- Your good health, sir.
- And yours, Mr Gillott.

02:04:27.502 --> 02:04:28.862
- Turner.
- Sir.

02:04:28.962 --> 02:04:31.322
- I have a proposition to make.
- Oh?

02:04:31.422 --> 02:04:33.742
- I like your pictures.
- Well, thank you, sir.

02:04:33.842 --> 02:04:35.326
My wife is especially partial

02:04:35.426 --> 02:04:38.121
to your companion pieces
that grace our drawing room.

02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:41.082
Please convey my felicitations
to your dear lady.

02:04:41.182 --> 02:04:43.075
I will, thank you.

02:04:45.103 --> 02:04:48.048
And now I wish to show you
one of my pictures.

02:04:48.148 --> 02:04:50.749
Oh, indeed, sir? I am much intrigued.

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:57.223
Five-pound note, exceeding pretty.

02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:58.808
Quite so.

02:04:58.908 --> 02:05:01.895
For all of your paintings,
I will give you 20,000 of these,

02:05:01.995 --> 02:05:04.137
100,000 pounds.

02:05:05.039 --> 02:05:09.694
All your oils, your watercolours,
your drawings, your sketchbooks,

02:05:09.794 --> 02:05:11.488
everything you've ever produced.

02:05:11.588 --> 02:05:14.106
100,000 pounds. What do you say?

02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:21.039
Turner, I am a man of wealth,

02:05:21.139 --> 02:05:23.124
a self-made man.

02:05:23.224 --> 02:05:25.752
Throughout the world
three quarters of everything that is written

02:05:25.852 --> 02:05:28.412
is written with a Gillott pen nib,
one of my nibs.

02:05:29.397 --> 02:05:31.800
I enjoy my wealth.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:35.127
Two things delight me in my life:

02:05:35.904 --> 02:05:38.681
fashioning a nib from steel
and making money,

02:05:38.781 --> 02:05:42.185
and I like to spend my money
on things that give me pleasure.

02:05:42.285 --> 02:05:45.396
And your pictures give me much pleasure.

02:05:45.496 --> 02:05:47.941
I want them, all of them.

02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:50.100
Sir...

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:54.114
with a modicum of regret

02:05:54.214 --> 02:05:55.990
and somewhat of a heavy heart,

02:05:56.090 --> 02:06:00.485
I'm sorry to say,
'tis out of the question.

02:06:01.638 --> 02:06:03.957
- How so?
- They are bequeathed.

02:06:04.057 --> 02:06:06.126
Bequeathed? To whom?

02:06:06.226 --> 02:06:08.076
To the British nation, sir.

02:06:08.895 --> 02:06:11.580
And what will the British nation
pay you?

02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:16.761
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

02:06:16.861 --> 02:06:19.597
Turner, I am offering you a price
you will never see again.

02:06:19.697 --> 02:06:22.308
Indeed, sir, by which I am much humbled.

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:25.010
- Then accept my offer.
- I cannot, sir.

02:06:25.828 --> 02:06:27.804
I wish to see my work...

02:06:29.082 --> 02:06:31.433
displayed in one place,

02:06:32.126 --> 02:06:34.279
all together,

02:06:34.379 --> 02:06:35.771
viewed by the public,

02:06:36.506 --> 02:06:38.398
gratis.

02:06:39.550 --> 02:06:41.360
Turner, this is perverse.

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:45.123
- So be it.
- You cannot give your pictures away.

02:06:45.223 --> 02:06:49.034
They are too valuable.
Don't be a fool, man. See sense.

02:07:07.996 --> 02:07:10.190
- I wish you good day, sir.
- I wish you good day, sir.

02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:12.974
Me damsel, be so kind
as to show the gentleman out?

02:07:42.655 --> 02:07:44.349
Oh, there! Oh!

02:07:44.449 --> 02:07:46.434
Oh, there.

02:07:46.534 --> 02:07:48.353
Oh! Oh, there. Stay there, stay there.

02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:50.772
- Don't move.
- I... slipped.

02:07:50.872 --> 02:07:52.389
Oh, Lord.

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:55.902
- Oh, dear. All right?
- It's passing.

02:07:56.002 --> 02:07:57.070
There, stay.

02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.572
Stay there. Oh, my dear.

02:07:59.672 --> 02:08:01.407
- Oh, there.
- No.

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:04.035
It's passed. I've got to get on.

02:08:04.135 --> 02:08:07.038
No, no, no, no.
Sit ye down, sit ye down.

02:08:07.138 --> 02:08:10.625
No, no. Got to get on now.
Got to get on now.

02:08:10.725 --> 02:08:13.002
- No, you must sit down and rest now.
- The canvas.

02:08:13.102 --> 02:08:15.338
- The canvas is damaged.
- Oh, that's all right.

02:08:15.438 --> 02:08:17.840
Come and sit down. Sit ye down.

02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:19.717
- There.
- Now, bustle about.

02:08:19.817 --> 02:08:23.545
- Bustle about.
- Oh, there! There be no helping you!

02:08:39.587 --> 02:08:41.364
"Be still, my dear Molly

02:08:41.464 --> 02:08:42.907
"Dear Molly, be still

02:08:43.007 --> 02:08:45.868
"No more urge that soft sigh to thy will

02:08:45.968 --> 02:08:49.038
"It is anxious each wish to fulfil

02:08:49.138 --> 02:08:52.166
"But I prithee, dear Molly, be still

02:08:52.266 --> 02:08:56.129
"By thy lips' quivering motion I ween

02:08:56.229 --> 02:09:00.499
"To the centre of...
where love lies between

02:09:03.486 --> 02:09:06.806
"A passport to bliss is thy will

02:09:06.906 --> 02:09:11.343
- "Yet I prithee, dear Molly, be still"
- "Dear Molly, be still"

02:09:12.036 --> 02:09:15.690
"By thy eyes
when half-closed with delight

02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:17.984
"That so languishing turn from the light

02:09:18.084 --> 02:09:21.520
"With my kisses I'll hide 'em, I will

02:09:22.505 --> 02:09:27.160
- "Yet, prithee, dear Molly, be still"
- "Yet, prithee, dear Molly, be still"

02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:30.121
"By thy bosom so throbbing with truth

02:09:30.221 --> 02:09:35.158
"Its short heavings to me...
speak reproof

02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:40.006
"By the half-blushing mark on each hill

02:09:40.106 --> 02:09:43.875
"Oh, my Molly, dear Molly, be still."

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.765
Thank you. How many do you want?

02:11:54.865 --> 02:11:56.299
- One, please.
- One?

02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.761
There you go.

02:12:17.513 --> 02:12:18.822
There.

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:24.650
What ails thee?

02:12:24.921 --> 02:12:26.746
Let me take your hat.

02:12:31.652 --> 02:12:33.179
Here.

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:36.224
- My sketchbook.
- Oh.

02:12:36.324 --> 02:12:39.393
- It's not here.
- 'Tis in your other pocket, then?

02:12:39.493 --> 02:12:42.355
- No, it's not.
- Don't ye worry about it now.

02:12:42.455 --> 02:12:45.598
'Twill be somewhere.
We can look for it later.

02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:48.945
Where is the canvas?

02:12:49.045 --> 02:12:52.021
'Tis behind you, dear, on the chair.

02:12:56.010 --> 02:12:58.528
- You want I should take it upstairs?
- What?

02:12:59.347 --> 02:13:00.780
Your canvas.

02:13:01.474 --> 02:13:03.366
No, no, no, no, no.

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.247
I'll get you a drink.

02:13:15.479 --> 02:13:17.056
There.

02:13:24.955 --> 02:13:26.055
So...

02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:31.070
where have you been today?

02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:33.819
Did you go back to Hyde Park?

02:13:36.592 --> 02:13:38.651
How be it all progressing?

02:13:40.179 --> 02:13:42.572
It's an engineering phenomenon.

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:47.118
Crystal pane upon crystal pane,

02:13:47.895 --> 02:13:49.922
reaching up beyond the clouds.

02:13:50.022 --> 02:13:52.508
'Twill be a marvel to behold.

02:13:54.068 --> 02:13:56.127
It's a glass cathedral.

02:13:59.699 --> 02:14:01.341
It's the one...

02:14:03.444 --> 02:14:04.645
Oh, here.

02:14:14.171 --> 02:14:16.022
Oh, there.

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:19.575
Oh, there.

02:14:30.563 --> 02:14:33.841
So bad! Look at your messings.

02:14:35.234 --> 02:14:37.418
Naughty pussy.

02:14:41.574 --> 02:14:43.258
I don't know!

02:15:23.991 --> 02:15:27.176
Now, dear, here be good Dr Price for ye.

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:30.439
He has come all the way from Margate.

02:15:30.539 --> 02:15:32.942
- Dr Price.
- Good morning, Turner.

02:15:33.042 --> 02:15:34.902
If there be anything
you do need, Doctor...

02:15:35.002 --> 02:15:38.354
- Thank you, Mrs Booth.
- ...I shall be downstairs.

02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:42.525
Now, my dear Turner,
how are you feeling?

02:15:42.885 --> 02:15:45.913
Somewhat weakened, sir.

02:15:46.013 --> 02:15:47.822
I'm so sorry.

02:15:52.645 --> 02:15:54.547
We all miss you in Margate.

02:15:59.109 --> 02:16:01.095
Margate, yes.

02:16:01.195 --> 02:16:02.712
Are you in pain?

02:16:03.405 --> 02:16:04.797
Here.

02:16:05.491 --> 02:16:07.675
- Shortness of breath?
- Yes.

02:16:08.661 --> 02:16:10.261
Now, then...

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:15.234
Did you come up on the railway?

02:16:15.334 --> 02:16:19.864
I did, and the truth is,
I can never travel by train

02:16:19.964 --> 02:16:22.450
without recalling
your miraculous painting.

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:37.789
My dear Turner, I am obliged to inform you
that your condition is grave.

02:16:39.984 --> 02:16:42.136
Your days are numbered

02:16:42.236 --> 02:16:45.263
and if you have affairs
to attend to in this world

02:16:45.364 --> 02:16:49.634
you should do so now
and prepare yourself for the next.

02:16:50.244 --> 02:16:51.718
Dr Price...

02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:55.941
with the utmost respect,

02:16:56.040 --> 02:17:00.905
may I suggest you take yourself
downstairs to Mrs Booth,

02:17:01.004 --> 02:17:04.617
avail yourself
of a large glass of sherry,

02:17:04.717 --> 02:17:08.820
come back up here
and reassess your opinion?

02:17:10.055 --> 02:17:13.156
No, sir, I'm afraid
I shan't be doing that.

02:17:18.397 --> 02:17:21.708
So I'm to become a non-entity.

02:17:23.067 --> 02:17:26.347
I do not understand exactly
what you mean by a non-entity.

02:17:33.579 --> 02:17:36.357
- Good day to you, Doctor.
- Good day, Mrs Booth. Thank you.

02:17:36.457 --> 02:17:39.109
Oh, I shall send out
for the laudanum directly.

02:17:39.209 --> 02:17:41.028
Splendid.
He couldn't be in better hands.

02:17:41.128 --> 02:17:42.571
I do my best.

02:17:42.671 --> 02:17:45.991
So, will you be taking the boat back
from Chelsea Pier there?

02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:48.744
Indeed. I shall catch the midday train
from Charing Cross.

02:17:48.843 --> 02:17:52.373
Well, I do wish'ee a safe journey,
and I thank you, Doctor.

02:17:52.473 --> 02:17:54.323
I shall return shortly.

02:18:35.182 --> 02:18:36.699
Number six.

02:18:56.286 --> 02:18:57.730
- I need a rest.
- Pardon?

02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:59.430
I need a rest.

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:08.106
Can we help, my dear?

02:19:12.136 --> 02:19:15.956
- I'm looking for an old gentleman.
- An old gentleman?

02:19:16.056 --> 02:19:19.334
- Do you have a name?
- There's a lot of old gentlemen round here.

02:19:19.434 --> 02:19:21.545
- He lives next door.
- Number six.

02:19:21.645 --> 02:19:25.581
There is an old gentleman
lives next-door with his good lady wife.

02:19:26.483 --> 02:19:28.793
They say he has the sickness.

02:19:30.821 --> 02:19:32.588
Are you a relative?

02:19:37.661 --> 02:19:39.344
No matter.

02:19:40.581 --> 02:19:42.273
- Good day.
- Good day.

02:19:42.374 --> 02:19:43.641
Good day.

02:20:01.364 --> 02:20:04.505
No, 'tis I. 'Tis I. There!

02:20:04.605 --> 02:20:07.331
'tis I.

02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:14.473
Poor, wretched soul.

02:20:14.573 --> 02:20:16.674
She be drowned dead.

02:20:17.659 --> 02:20:19.395
There.

02:20:19.495 --> 02:20:22.388
The suffering she must have seen.

02:20:24.917 --> 02:20:27.643
If there be a God, he be a cruel one.

02:20:32.341 --> 02:20:36.120
- What are you doing?
- I have to sketch her.

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:39.623
Get back into bed now,
Joseph Mallord William Turner!

02:20:39.723 --> 02:20:43.826
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There be no shoes on your feet!

02:20:54.947 --> 02:20:56.214
Poor creature.

02:21:09.044 --> 02:21:11.196
Oh, there. Let me take you in.

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:12.823
There... No!

02:21:12.923 --> 02:21:15.659
Come in. You can finish that later.

02:21:54.381 --> 02:21:56.399
Me damsel...

02:22:16.778 --> 02:22:19.171
The sun is God.
