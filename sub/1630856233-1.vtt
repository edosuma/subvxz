[woman 1 in Norwegian]
I know it's Christmas,

01:05.708 --> 01:08.291
but you don't get
into the holiday spirit when it's sunny.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.500
-I need to get home to Norway.
-[woman 2 on phone] Yeah.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.000

Has it been snowing a lot?

01:18.166 --> 01:21.125
[mom] Sure,
but tell me about your boyfriend!

01:21.208 --> 01:24.375
Well, you can meet him
if you come to visit us.

01:24.958 --> 01:27.833
We're settling in nicely.
We're doing very well.

We've almost unpacked everything.

01:29.958 --> 01:31.708
Hold on, Mom. Hello?

Herregud?

02:10.583 --> 02:13.125
And I know this might be early
for Norwegian standards,

02:13.208 --> 02:16.000
but, in India,
we would have had two kids already

02:16.083 --> 02:17.333
and they would be in college.

02:17.416 --> 02:19.541
[both chuckling]

02:19.625 --> 02:25.458
So, if you're not, like, doing anything
for the next couple of decades…

02:25.541 --> 02:26.375
Yeah.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.833

02:43.750 --> 02:46.916
that I have diabetes running in my family
and that's…

02:47.000 --> 02:48.666
Diabetes is not contagious.

So?

04:04.458 --> 04:05.291
Yeah.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.375
What would you say…

04:09.833 --> 04:10.666
to…

04:11.708 --> 04:16.166
joining me and my family
for Christmas in Norway this year?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.625
[hesitating]

04:17.708 --> 04:21.375
[sighs] I would love to, but it's like you
don't know my middle name.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.500
I'm sorry. What's up?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.333
Oh. [chuckles]

06:17.416 --> 06:21.791
It's just a family sweater tradition thing
that we've been doing forever.

06:22.791 --> 06:25.000
I'm sure my mom has
knitted one for you too.

06:25.083 --> 06:26.958
Oh, I should have got them something.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.583
Oh, like the Indian equivalent
of a family sweater.

You know what I was
trying to tell you earlier.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.833
Yeah.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.958
-Um, I haven't--

[Jashan gasps] What is this?

09:16.541 --> 09:20.208
Yeah. So that's like this tradition
that we had,

making all these Christmas
decorations every year.

It's all wonky and messed up.
It's so sweet.

[Anne-Lise chuckles]

11:50.416 --> 11:51.833
Uh…

11:56.083 --> 11:57.666
So, your mom seems nice.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.708
Do you think, uh, she likes me?

12:02.666 --> 12:04.666
[lamp humming]

12:07.333 --> 12:09.500
-[whispers] Hey, are you awake?
-Yeah.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.000
-Yeah.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.125
I was asking,

12:14.208 --> 12:17.666
do you think your mom likes me?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.083
Yeah.

12:21.041 --> 12:21.958
Sure.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.208
[Jashan sighs]

12:24.750 --> 12:26.833
You didn't tell her I was Indian.

12:27.583 --> 12:28.541
Uh…

12:29.791 --> 12:31.625
Well, that shouldn't really matter.

12:32.541 --> 12:35.250
Yeah. So then, why not tell her?

12:36.791 --> 12:37.666
[sighs]

12:37.750 --> 12:39.541
You know, my dad, he was like…

12:41.125 --> 12:42.875
the one who would reason with her.

12:42.958 --> 12:43.791
[Jashan] Hmm.

12:45.125 --> 12:49.250
So if I told her, like, three weeks ago
that we were engaged, she would…

12:50.791 --> 12:51.625
Uh…

12:51.708 --> 12:52.666
What?

12:53.416 --> 12:54.541
Make me a sweater?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.666
-Photoshop me in a family card?
-[Thea scoffs]

12:58.750 --> 13:01.750
She would sit alone in her room…

13:03.875 --> 13:06.416
and Google everything.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.708
Old Indian traditions and stuff.

13:09.791 --> 13:10.708
[Jashan] And so?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.458
She would blow it
totally out of proportion.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.000
[Balder panting]

13:19.083 --> 13:20.875
[female presenter] In India,
we are often told

13:20.958 --> 13:23.416
that a daughter's place is
with her in-laws.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.291
Contrary to the popular belief,

13:25.375 --> 13:29.333
this practice is just as common
in Indian cities as in the villages.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.750
-In today's day…
-[sighs]

13:31.833 --> 13:33.833
[Balder snuffling]

13:33.916 --> 13:36.541
[melancholy string music playing]

13:37.583 --> 13:38.583
Hmm…

13:42.000 --> 13:43.083
[sighs]

13:44.708 --> 13:45.666
Hmm.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.125
-[music continues]
-[bird hooting]

13:50.375 --> 13:52.583
[Jashan snoring]

14:03.125 --> 14:04.375
[music fades]

14:05.250 --> 14:07.250
[clock ticking]

14:13.583 --> 14:14.791
[scraping]

14:22.833 --> 14:24.833
[scraping continues]

14:31.833 --> 14:33.291
[poignant music playing]

14:41.208 --> 14:42.583
[in Norwegian] Good morning.

14:42.666 --> 14:43.916
[music stops]

14:45.125 --> 14:46.750
You're up early.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.833
Yeah, I'm really jet-lagged. [sniffles]

14:50.458 --> 14:52.750
-I've put on some coffee if you want.
-[cup thuds on table]

14:55.708 --> 14:57.958
Have you talked to Jørgen since…

15:01.875 --> 15:03.250
No, I haven't.

15:04.291 --> 15:07.000
No, I just mean…

15:08.166 --> 15:12.083
[whispers] I know that
it hasn't been easy for him either.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.125
The breakup.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.875
No, I'm sure it hasn't,
but it was a long time ago, Mom.

15:18.958 --> 15:23.416
No, it's just a shame
that it had to end like that.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.041
-You and the boy next door.
-[scoffs]

15:28.166 --> 15:30.541
All that stuff just got too complicated.

15:31.708 --> 15:34.625
-[slurping]
-[Anne-Lise] Yeah, but you know that

15:35.666 --> 15:38.541
Dad and I always thought
it was going to be the two of you.

15:38.625 --> 15:41.041
-You're up early as well.
-Mm-hmm.

15:41.666 --> 15:44.916
I'm going to get started
on the rice pudding now

15:46.041 --> 15:47.291
because…

15:49.875 --> 15:52.791
Dad always used to make it
two days in advance.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.291
So I better get started.

15:54.375 --> 15:57.500
So… is Shazam asleep?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.833
Jashan is asleep.

16:02.666 --> 16:03.500
Yeah.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.458
Right.

16:06.250 --> 16:10.500
You could have told me a little earlier

16:11.166 --> 16:12.750
that he is…

16:14.375 --> 16:15.416
That he is?

16:16.958 --> 16:18.041
[sighs] Uh…

16:22.250 --> 16:23.291
[Thea] Indian?

16:23.375 --> 16:26.958
Is that okay to say, though?
"Indian"? Is that allowed?

16:27.541 --> 16:29.083
Yes, Mom. You can say Indian.

16:29.166 --> 16:35.083
[Anne-Lise] Fine. But do I have to make
two Christmas dinners now?

16:35.166 --> 16:36.708
I don't know.

16:38.625 --> 16:44.875
I know that Norwegian and Indian cultures
are incredibly different.

16:44.958 --> 16:48.541
-What have you been googling now?
-[Anne-Lise] I haven't been googling.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.041
There's just so much to do
before Christmas.

17:03.125 --> 17:07.250
I have to prepare the medister meatballs,
and then we have to get firewood.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.000
Your brother gets stressed out
if we don't have firewood.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.833
And now I might have to make
two Christmas dinners.

17:13.916 --> 17:19.958
I don't know your boyfriend, and I don't
know what they eat in India for Christmas.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.416
-[whimsical music playing]
-[in English] Good morning.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.791
[Jashan inhales deeply]

17:23.875 --> 17:26.000
How is this morning? [exhales]

17:26.708 --> 17:29.500
Yeah, the sun doesn't rise until ten.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.625
Good night. [exhales]

17:32.208 --> 17:33.375
[music fades]

17:35.583 --> 17:36.833
-Jash.
-[Jashan] Huh?

17:38.833 --> 17:40.250
-Um…
-[Jashan] Hmm.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.125
-I was thinking.
-[Jashan] Hmm?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.208
[inhales deeply]

17:48.791 --> 17:52.666
Maybe we should give my mom
a… a bit more time.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.833
You don't wanna tell her
about the engagement?

17:54.916 --> 17:57.791
No. Yeah.
Of course I want to tell her. It's just--

17:57.875 --> 17:59.916
Do I need to ask for her permission
or something?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.791
No. No, no, no. That's not a thing here.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.458
We're very modern.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.833
[Jashan] Okay, well,
then we should just tell her.

18:06.916 --> 18:08.708
No need to keep it a secret, right?

18:10.958 --> 18:12.500
-Yeah.
-[Jashan] Yeah.

18:15.916 --> 18:17.833
I just want the timing to be right.

18:18.416 --> 18:19.250
[Jashan] Okay.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.541
When will the timing be right?

18:25.291 --> 18:26.125
[sniffles]

18:26.208 --> 18:27.291
[inhales sharply]

18:27.958 --> 18:30.125
I just want her to get to know you.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.833
And…

18:34.250 --> 18:36.500
see the side of you
that I fell in love with.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.125
-You want me to have sex with your mom?
-[Thea laughs]

18:40.291 --> 18:44.375
Fine. I just wasn't ready for this,
but, you know, if that's local tradition…

18:44.458 --> 18:47.000
-[whispers] No. [laughs]
-I'm happy to…

18:49.833 --> 18:50.666
What's up?

18:51.916 --> 18:53.750
-She will love you.
-[Jashan] Mm.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.416
And then we can tell her.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.583
-Yeah.
-Mm.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.416
It's going to be a perfect Christmas.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
[gentle music playing]

19:09.750 --> 19:14.500
DECEMBER 22ND
(TEENY TINY CHRISTMAS)

19:14.583 --> 19:16.166
[birds chirping]

19:23.625 --> 19:25.583
[Jashan] Hey, I know you told me
to be myself,

19:25.666 --> 19:28.791
but is there anything more I can do
to connect with your brother?

19:28.875 --> 19:31.208
Like what does he like? Sports? Snow?

19:31.291 --> 19:32.833
Moose?

19:32.916 --> 19:34.041
I don't know.

19:34.125 --> 19:35.416
[Thea] He's a good guy.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.125
You're gonna be fine. He's gonna like you.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.708
[Jashan sighs] Okay.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.708
And his wife is the fun one, right?

19:42.791 --> 19:44.250
-Yeah.
-[Jashan] Yeah.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.458
-No.
-[Jashan] No?

19:45.541 --> 19:47.833
But, yeah, but it's…

19:47.916 --> 19:49.333
Yeah, she would, but…

19:49.416 --> 19:52.083
More… More like no during Christmas.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.166
Not at Christmas?

19:53.916 --> 19:56.583
[Thea] No.
Because she's on edge with my mom.

19:56.666 --> 19:57.500
So it's…

19:58.208 --> 19:59.041
It's a no.

19:59.833 --> 20:00.666
Yeah.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.833
-Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
-[Jashan] It's gonna be fine.

20:03.916 --> 20:05.000
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.750
-[in Norwegian] Yes, I'm coming.
-[mumbling]

20:06.833 --> 20:07.833
What is it?

20:09.541 --> 20:10.958
Merry Christmas!

20:12.083 --> 20:13.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.583
[Thea chuckles]

20:14.666 --> 20:17.041
-[brother] Nice to see you.
-Hello, you!

20:17.125 --> 20:18.666
-[Thea] Hi.
-Hi. Merry Christmas.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.083
[Thea] Merry Christmas! And look at you!

20:21.166 --> 20:23.208
-Yes, look at me!
-[all chuckling]

20:23.291 --> 20:24.541
[Jashan] Merry Christmas!

20:26.000 --> 20:26.833
Who is that?

20:29.083 --> 20:30.791
Is that Josh?

20:32.041 --> 20:32.916
Jashan.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.833
Oh!

20:34.500 --> 20:35.625
Jashan.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.708
-[in English] Hi.
-This is my brother.

20:37.791 --> 20:39.166
Hi, I'm Simen.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.458
-Nice to meet you.
-[Simen] Nice to meet you.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.375
Uh, Jashan.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.166
Jashan, okay. Uh…

20:45.250 --> 20:47.625
This must be Ronja. God jul, Ronja.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.916
[in Norwegian] Hello. [groans]

20:50.000 --> 20:51.375
-Hello.
-[chuckles]

20:51.458 --> 20:52.875
-[woman] Okay.
-[Simen] Yeah.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.208
[in English] Having some trouble
with the chair?

20:55.291 --> 20:56.958
[Simen] Yeah, it's, uh…

20:57.041 --> 20:59.375
-[Jashan] Stuck? Okay. Can I try?
-Stuck, yeah. Sure.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.000
-I have a black belt in car seats.
-Okay.

21:02.083 --> 21:02.958
[both chuckle]

21:03.041 --> 21:04.666
-[Jashan] Jashan.
-[in Norwegian] Hello.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.333
[Jashan speaking indistinctly]

21:07.416 --> 21:11.416
[in Norwegian] Am I a horrible human being
if I say that I'm a little surprised?

21:13.291 --> 21:15.958
He's Indian. So what?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.000
That's really exciting!

21:19.125 --> 21:20.583
It's not exciting.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.333
Yes, it's very exciting.

21:23.416 --> 21:27.958
There are a billion Indians,
so the odds of meeting one are pretty big.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.708
I think he's very handsome.

21:30.833 --> 21:33.125
-[Ronja] Møkkastol!
-[in English] What is møkkastol?

21:33.208 --> 21:34.375
[in Norwegian] Shit chair.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.875
-[Jashan] Okay, shit chair.
-He's very handsome.

21:36.958 --> 21:40.166
[chuckles, snorts]

21:40.250 --> 21:41.208
What was that?

21:42.250 --> 21:43.125
Huh?

21:43.208 --> 21:46.333
What was that grunt?

21:46.416 --> 21:47.833
I didn't grunt.

21:48.833 --> 21:49.833
That smile?

21:50.958 --> 21:52.083
What's going on?

21:53.583 --> 21:54.666
[scoffs]

21:54.750 --> 21:57.208
-I wasn't supposed to tell you yet.
-What?

21:57.291 --> 22:00.958
[Jashan continues speaking indistinctly]

22:02.291 --> 22:03.166
[Thea sighs]

22:03.250 --> 22:05.166
-[gasps]
-What? Fucking hell.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.375
Huh? Are you kidding?

22:07.458 --> 22:10.041
Are you kidding? You just met.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.375
What did Anne-Lise say?

22:15.791 --> 22:18.500
-I haven't told her yet.
-You haven't. [sighs]

22:19.541 --> 22:22.916
I'm waiting for the perfect timing.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.291
Right. And you thought…

22:27.416 --> 22:29.166
that might be Christmas?

22:29.250 --> 22:30.083
Yeah?

22:30.708 --> 22:32.375
That's a really bad idea.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.708
Yeah, it's a bad idea.

22:35.625 --> 22:36.458
Nah.

22:37.708 --> 22:39.416
This is going to be great!

22:40.583 --> 22:43.041
-[Jashan in English] And we're good.
-[Ronja] Møkkastol.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.083
-[in Norwegian] Shit chair.
-Shit chair.

22:45.166 --> 22:46.250
[all laughing]

22:46.333 --> 22:48.041
[in English] You have to taste this.

22:48.125 --> 22:48.958
[indistinct chatter]

22:49.041 --> 22:50.791
This is also Norwegian.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.833
[Jashan] Okay, that's pretty cool.

22:52.916 --> 22:57.208
[Thea] Brown cheese on Christmas cake
is the best.

22:58.708 --> 22:59.541
For real.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.583
-This? This?
-Mm-hmm.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.291
-Come on.
-Cheers.

23:03.375 --> 23:04.208
Cheers.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.291
[indistinct conversation in Norwegian]

23:07.208 --> 23:08.375
[Jashan laughs]

23:08.458 --> 23:10.375
[in English] No. That bad?

23:10.458 --> 23:12.375
-No.
-No!

23:12.458 --> 23:14.083
It's very interesting.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.500
-It's very goaty, mamma.
-[chuckles]

23:16.583 --> 23:18.416
[ambient music playing]

23:18.500 --> 23:20.125
[laughing]

23:24.208 --> 23:25.166
Hey!

23:25.875 --> 23:29.875
-Are you ready? [laughs]
-[Jashan] Yes. No! [yells]

-[Simen] Eat, eat.

33:45.833 --> 33:46.833
Mmm.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.250
-Mmm. Oh!
-[Thea whispering] Okay, I think we just--

33:50.333 --> 33:52.125
-[Simen in Norwegian] Oh, it burns.
-Just go.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.375
-[exhales, sniffles]
-[Anne-Lise exhales]

33:54.958 --> 33:55.833
Mmm.

33:55.916 --> 33:59.083
I think it needs more time to set.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.166
[Anne-Lise and Simen moan]

34:03.250 --> 34:05.125
[in English] How many chilies did you use?

34:05.208 --> 34:09.083
Spice is about more than just chilies.
This is super mild.

34:09.166 --> 34:10.666
[Simen coughs]

34:10.750 --> 34:13.875
There's a difference between
Norwegian spicy and Indian spicy.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.250
[exhales] Yeah.

34:15.916 --> 34:17.708
[in Norwegian] I don't know
if Simen told you,

34:17.791 --> 34:20.541
but I lived in India
for a couple of months after high school.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.000
-[Thea laughing] What?
-Yes.

34:22.708 --> 34:27.041
[in English] Okay. Hildegunn, she… she…
she… lived in India for several months.

34:27.125 --> 34:29.666
-Oh! Oh, cool. That is cool.
-[Hildegunn chuckles]

34:29.750 --> 34:31.833
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. [chuckles]

34:32.541 --> 34:33.458
I actually…

34:33.541 --> 34:35.416
[chuckles] I wanted to show you this.

34:37.583 --> 34:38.416
-Ta-da!
-Wow.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.541
-[chuckles]
-It says, uh, "inner peace."

34:42.625 --> 34:44.458
Wow. Yeah. Wow.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.000
What is it? Don't you like it?

34:48.083 --> 34:49.500
It's very nice.

34:49.583 --> 34:50.833
-Yeah? [chuckles]
-[Jashan] Yeah.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.125
No. What is it?

34:52.208 --> 34:53.708
It might not say "inner peace."

34:53.791 --> 34:55.791
[Simen speaking indistinctly]

34:55.875 --> 34:57.583
[Anne-Lise panting]

34:57.666 --> 34:58.500
What?

34:58.583 --> 35:01.250
[in Norwegian] It doesn't matter
what it means, does it?

35:01.333 --> 35:04.083
Thea, it is important
because it's a tattoo.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.791
It's cut into my body until I die.

35:07.541 --> 35:09.250
I want to know what it says.

35:14.041 --> 35:17.791
[in English] Hypothetically speaking,
it might say gori.

35:18.291 --> 35:22.208
That doesn't sound so bad.
[chuckles] What… What does that mean?

35:22.291 --> 35:23.291
White girl.

35:27.916 --> 35:29.916
[whispers indistinctly]

35:32.416 --> 35:36.250
White girl, that's… [inhales shakily]
…exactly what I am.

35:36.833 --> 35:37.666
Yes.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.250
So… So that's very accurate.

35:43.416 --> 35:45.125
-[Jashan] Yes. Yes, it is.
-Right?

35:45.875 --> 35:47.041
[Hildegunn breathes shakily]

35:47.125 --> 35:48.166
I…

35:48.250 --> 35:51.000
I'm just gonna go help the others. Yeah.

35:51.083 --> 35:54.458
I think your "poopadoonk"
was a little bit dry, by the way.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.583
[indistinct murmuring in Norwegian]

36:01.666 --> 36:02.916
[Jashan sighs]

36:04.708 --> 36:05.875
[chuckles softly]

36:06.583 --> 36:08.916
-[in English] So that didn't work.
-Yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.500
[mellow music playing]

36:11.458 --> 36:16.708
Maybe tomorrow we can try to do Christmas
the Norwegian way?

36:17.458 --> 36:20.041
Okay. What way is that?

36:22.083 --> 36:22.916
You know…

36:23.000 --> 36:24.083
[Norwegian folk music plays]

36:24.166 --> 36:25.500
[Simen in Norwegian] Coming down!

36:25.583 --> 36:27.291
DECEMBER 23RD
(TINY CHRISTMAS)

36:27.375 --> 36:30.416
[Anne-Lise] "Out on a hike,
what's not to like?"

36:30.500 --> 36:31.708
[Jashan huffing, grunting]

36:33.041 --> 36:35.000
[Simen] Out on a hike, what's not to…

36:35.083 --> 36:36.708
[grunting]

36:37.708 --> 36:38.541
[exhales]

36:39.583 --> 36:41.000
[in English] Are you okay?

36:41.083 --> 36:42.291
[Ronja in Norwegian] Hello.

36:43.083 --> 36:45.041
[Jashan in English] Wow.
How's she doing that?

36:46.125 --> 36:49.166
In Norway we say that Norwegians are born
with skis on their feet.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.625
Yeah? Sounds like a painful childbirth.

36:52.875 --> 36:55.041
-[Jashan panting]
-You wanna go back, Jash?

36:55.125 --> 36:56.041
No.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.000
[in Norwegian] Out on a hike,
what's not to like?

36:58.708 --> 36:59.875
-[Thea in English] Sure?
-Yeah.

37:00.833 --> 37:03.666
-Okay. Come on. I can help you.
-[Jashan panting]

37:03.750 --> 37:04.750
[Jashan] Yeah.

37:05.541 --> 37:06.708
Okay.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.250
-[Thea] Okay.
-Okay.

37:08.333 --> 37:09.458
-So…
-Yeah.

37:09.541 --> 37:12.875
We have this lunch place
just on the other side of the hill.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.416
There's a lunch place?

37:14.500 --> 37:17.375
-Sounds nice?
-Oh, yeah. Lunch place.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.291
Okay.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.541
[in Norwegian] Come on! Go, go, go!

37:20.625 --> 37:24.125
[Jashan in English] Okay. So…
So, what kind of food do they serve?

37:24.791 --> 37:26.125
[wind whistling]

37:27.208 --> 37:28.666
-[Jashan sniffles]
-Here you go.

37:28.750 --> 37:29.833
[indistinct chatter]

37:29.916 --> 37:31.000
Ah!

37:31.083 --> 37:34.458
So this is what we would call
koselig in Norway.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.916
[shivers]

37:40.000 --> 37:40.833
What?

37:41.458 --> 37:45.708
No. It's just that when you said
there was a lunch place,

37:46.708 --> 37:50.875
you know, in my head,
I thought there was gonna be…

37:50.958 --> 37:52.083
A restaurant?

37:52.166 --> 37:53.916
[everyone chuckles]

37:55.208 --> 37:59.333
Yeah. No, that would be crazy
if there was a restaurant.

37:59.875 --> 38:00.708
Yeah.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.750
-[skiers in Norwegian] Hi.
-[all] Hi.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.291
[Anne-Lise] So, what do you guys think?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.916
Should we get going?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.916
Maybe you should go in advance?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.250
So we can ski at our tempo,
so he doesn't feel…

38:16.333 --> 38:18.625
-Go ahead?
-We always ski together.

38:18.708 --> 38:21.333
I know, but it's a bit different.

38:21.416 --> 38:23.541
But we're supposed to make
gingerbread cookies together.

38:23.625 --> 38:26.375
Can't we make gingerbread cookies
some other time?

38:26.458 --> 38:30.458
Of course! We can move
the gingerbread cookie making to Easter.

38:30.541 --> 38:31.750
[chuckles] Totally.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.541
[Simen grunting]

38:33.625 --> 38:34.750
All right…

38:34.833 --> 38:36.833
-I need to pack the rucksack.
-[Hildegunn] Take this…

38:37.416 --> 38:38.875
[Jashan in English] What's happening?

38:40.291 --> 38:43.208
Uh… We… The two of us can go together.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.208
Okay.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.500
[sniffles] Yeah.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.583
[Jashan grunting]

38:50.833 --> 38:52.250
[grunts, pants]

38:53.500 --> 38:54.333
You okay?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.416
Ah. I'm great!

38:57.208 --> 38:59.458
-[skiers in Norwegian] Hi.
-[Thea] Hi.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.083
[in English] I am terrific.

39:02.708 --> 39:06.041
-Yeah. It's called koselig, right?
-[Thea] We're home soon. I promise.

39:06.125 --> 39:09.166
We just need to go down to Oksetjønn
and take a left to Skjerdalen.

39:09.250 --> 39:12.208
Those names mean nothing.
You're making them up.

39:13.750 --> 39:14.583
I won't do it.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.291
-[sighs]
-[Jashan] I won't do it. Leave me here.

39:17.791 --> 39:18.791
Leave me to die.

39:21.833 --> 39:22.791
I have an idea.

39:23.375 --> 39:26.416
[both breathe heavily]

39:28.250 --> 39:29.583
Are you ready?

39:29.666 --> 39:31.791
No. Are you ready?

39:31.875 --> 39:33.083
Uh… [sighs]

39:33.666 --> 39:34.500
Not really.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.666
Have you ever done this before?

39:36.750 --> 39:38.166
Yeah. Uh--

39:38.833 --> 39:39.916
No. Uh--

39:40.833 --> 39:42.291
My dad used to do it with me.

39:43.041 --> 39:43.875
Okay.

39:43.958 --> 39:45.208
[breathes deeply]

39:45.291 --> 39:47.083
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay. [chuckles]

39:47.583 --> 39:49.833
[delightful music playing]

39:49.916 --> 39:51.458
-[Thea] Yes!
-[Jashan] Whoo!

39:51.541 --> 39:53.666
-[Thea whoops]
-[Jashan laughs nervously]

39:54.583 --> 39:56.791
-Hi.
-Yes!

39:56.875 --> 39:59.458
Yes. Okay. Okay.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.125
Whoo! Whoo!

40:02.208 --> 40:05.375
-This is… It's actually working.
-It's working.

40:05.458 --> 40:06.666
[Thea whoops]

40:06.750 --> 40:08.541
[Jashan] I'm skiing!

40:12.750 --> 40:13.875
[sighs]

40:13.958 --> 40:15.041
[slurping]

40:16.000 --> 40:17.541
[in Norwegian] Where are they?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.583
It's getting dark.

40:21.416 --> 40:24.708
Do you want me to ask Simen
to look for them?

40:24.791 --> 40:26.583
-[Anne-Lise] No.
-No.

40:26.666 --> 40:30.625
No, let him relax.
He's put on his comfy joggers…

40:31.958 --> 40:34.541
with a glass of Christmas soda
in his hand,

40:35.250 --> 40:37.500
getting into the spirit with Die Hard.

40:37.583 --> 40:38.708
[chuckles]

40:39.375 --> 40:40.458
[engine rumbles]

40:48.791 --> 40:50.791
[birds chirping]

40:59.625 --> 41:00.916
[in English] I'm really sorry.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.625
-For what?
-[Thea sighs]

41:05.708 --> 41:07.458
For my family acting weird.

41:09.416 --> 41:11.416
[sighs] I love weird.

41:13.041 --> 41:15.125
Christmas is just a lot. [scoffs]

41:15.208 --> 41:18.958
Yeah. [scoffs]
I got the feeling. [chuckles]

41:19.041 --> 41:21.958
[Thea] It's just difficult without my dad.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.125
He was like… [laughs]

41:27.291 --> 41:28.916
Father Christmas.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.958
And every year
is just a reminder of what we lost.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.000
[Jashan sighs]

41:36.083 --> 41:37.833
[poignant music playing]

41:37.916 --> 41:39.916
And I really want them to like you

41:41.000 --> 41:42.166
because I love you.

41:44.333 --> 41:48.750
You know, in Norway, we call this koselig.

41:49.333 --> 41:50.250
[laughs]

42:02.583 --> 42:03.458
[music fades]

42:03.541 --> 42:04.541
[engine rumbles]

42:13.500 --> 42:14.833
[turns off engine]

42:15.333 --> 42:16.375
[sighs]

42:16.458 --> 42:17.708
[in Norwegian] Hi.

42:21.000 --> 42:21.875
[Jashan] Hi.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.125
Hey, Thea.

42:26.333 --> 42:27.208
Hey, Jørgen.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.041
[in English] You guys know each other?

42:30.125 --> 42:32.791
That's crazy. What a small country.

42:40.625 --> 42:43.333
[in Norwegian] Are you going somewhere?
What are you doing here?

42:43.416 --> 42:44.958
Anne-Lise called.

42:45.041 --> 42:46.416
She was worried that…

42:47.958 --> 42:49.583
Worried you were lost.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.333
No.

42:52.416 --> 42:54.708
No, I'm not lost.

42:55.791 --> 42:58.958
-[Jashan in English] Hey.
-I'm just telling him that we're not lost.

42:59.958 --> 43:03.875
We're not lost. We're just going to
"Oksischen" and "Shellbraider."

43:03.958 --> 43:05.958
-Yeah.
-Yes. All right. Yeah.

43:06.041 --> 43:06.875
[Jørgen] Okay.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.750
You sure you don't want a ride?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.625
-Dude, we would love a ride.
-Yes. We're fine.

43:12.708 --> 43:14.250
-[Jørgen] Yeah?
-What are you saying?

43:14.333 --> 43:17.291
I'm not gonna ski back.
Yes, we would love a ride.

43:17.375 --> 43:19.333
-[Jørgen] Okay.
-Thank you so much. That's amazing.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.583
[gasps] Oh, dude,
can I sit in the carriage?

43:21.666 --> 43:22.875
[Jørgen] Let me take the skis.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.666
[inquisitive music playing]

43:50.166 --> 43:51.666
-[engine turns off]
-[Jørgen sniffles]

43:51.750 --> 43:53.125
[music fades]

43:54.083 --> 43:55.333
[Thea grunts, exhales]

43:56.708 --> 43:57.625
[Jørgen sighs]

43:57.708 --> 43:59.333
[in Norwegian] Thanks for the ride.

43:59.416 --> 44:01.416
[in English] Oh, God bless you, Jørgen.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.333
Dude, we're making something called
"pepper cakes." You wanna come inside?

44:06.250 --> 44:07.541
I probably shouldn't.

44:07.625 --> 44:09.375
What do you mean, dude? You saved my life.

44:09.458 --> 44:11.791
Come on. Come inside.
We'll have a drink or something.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.333
It might be a bit weird.

44:14.416 --> 44:17.333
Why would it be weird? What?
You guys used to hook up or something?

44:17.416 --> 44:20.416
[Jashan and Jørgen chuckle]

44:20.500 --> 44:22.750
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Together for five years.

44:22.833 --> 44:24.833
[Jashan and Jørgen chuckle]

44:28.250 --> 44:29.083
Oh.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.208
[soft, dramatic music playing]

44:34.041 --> 44:34.875
Oh.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.916
-[Jashan sighs]
-She didn't tell you?

44:40.000 --> 44:40.833
[Thea] Uh…

44:44.708 --> 44:48.000
Didn't really… get to that part.

44:48.625 --> 44:52.083
No, we just live together.
We don't talk about stuff. [chuckles]

44:53.208 --> 44:55.208
Hmm. [chuckles awkwardly]

44:55.958 --> 44:57.541
Guess I'll see you around.

44:58.166 --> 44:59.375
[exhales]

45:02.958 --> 45:04.625
Oh, hey, see you around, dude.

45:09.375 --> 45:10.583
[in Norwegian] Merry Christmas.

45:13.083 --> 45:14.750

[cutlery scraping]

58:48.833 --> 58:50.375
And what is this delicacy?

58:54.000 --> 58:55.625
-It's…
-[Hildegunn] It's, um…

58:56.500 --> 58:57.500

-Great crispy pork crackling, Mom.

Thank you, my boy.

59:07.083 --> 59:08.625

59:08.708 --> 59:10.458
[in English] It looks so good.

59:11.583 --> 59:13.375
[whispers] Exactly what is this?

59:15.333 --> 59:16.458
It's, um…

59:16.541 --> 59:17.458
It's pig.

59:18.791 --> 59:22.208
Oh no. Maybe you… you can't eat pig.

59:23.875 --> 59:26.083
Uh, I'm Hindu. Muslims don't eat pork.

59:26.166 --> 59:30.250
-[in Norwegian] Yes, of course.
-Yes. I remember now.

59:30.333 --> 59:31.708
[in English] I forgot. [laughs]

59:32.458 --> 59:35.833
[in Norwegian] Ronja, you have to eat
your food, not just move it around.

59:35.916 --> 59:37.166
I don't like it.

59:37.250 --> 59:38.250
What?

59:38.333 --> 59:41.458
Grandma has spent so much time making it.

59:41.541 --> 59:43.041
You have to taste it. [chuckles]

[in English] Have some sauce.

01:00:08.166 --> 01:00:11.333
Sauce. Yes. What sauce is this?

01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:13.708
It's nice. It's a nice--

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:14.875
Fat sauce.

01:00:20.125 --> 01:00:21.083
Fat sauce?

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:22.708
Yeah.

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:25.708
-You have to have it.
-It's very good.

01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:28.083
[Simen in Norwegian] Otherwise,
it'll be too dry.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.541
[Hildegunn] Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:00:30.166 --> 01:00:32.583

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:40.750
And what kind of fat is this?

01:00:40.833 --> 01:00:42.750
Oh, no, no. It's not fat.

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:46.125
Aquavit, the water of life.

01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:49.500
You know, it's the potato booze
I was telling you about?

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:50.583
-Yeah.
-[Jashan] Yeah.

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:53.791
[indistinct conversation
in Norwegian continues]

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:55.916
[in English] It helps.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.625
[slurps, gulps]

01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:01.833
[glass thuds on table]

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.041
-This does help.
-[Thea] Mm-hmm.

01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:09.625
-Can I have some more?
-[Thea] Yeah.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.833

-[Jashan slurps]
-[glass thuds on table]

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.958
Yeah. But you don't need to do
the whole shot.

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.625
I think I do.

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:26.875
I don't think that's so smart, but…

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.333
[indistinct conversation
and laughter continues]

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:30.708

-[Hildegunn] Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:57.875
Mm. [slurps]

-[gulps, hiccups]
-[in English] Can you stop?

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.625
-Stop. You're drunk.
-[Jashan burps]

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:04.916
You're drunk.

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.041
[inhales deeply] Uh…

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.083
-Uh, do you want…
-No. No. I'm not drinking.

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:11.291
I'm… Really. It's… It's Christmas.

01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.916
-[sighs] Of course.

[indistinct conversation in Norwegian]

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.833
[in Hindi] Now this is more like it!

01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:57.166
[inhales deeply]

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:58.375
Mm!

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.041
[in English] I'm so glad you liked it.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.083
-Liked it? I love it.
-[Anne-Lise] Oh.

01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:05.958
Yeah, it's so, uh…

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.625
-What the hell?
-Stop.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.541
[Jashan] Hindu is a Norwegian spice brand?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.083
[whispers] Please, just…

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.416
-Black Boy?
-[whispers] Yeah. It's fine. Stop.

01:03:24.666 --> 01:03:26.791
[Jashan] I'm sorry, it's just… [chuckles]

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:30.416
…as an Indian person, I never thought
I would be offended by spices.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.125
-Yeah.
-But these are pretty racist condiments--

01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:38.166
[in Norwegian] Has he been seasoning
my pork with garlic powder and piri-piri?

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.583
[in English] I mean, come on.

01:03:39.666 --> 01:03:43.625
No disrespect,
but I use an entire garlic to fry an egg.

01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.708
-You understand it's challenging to eat…
-Jashan.

01:03:46.416 --> 01:03:51.166
…unseasoned pork with crunchy fat
and chewy fat and fat sauce.

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:56.500
Why do you have Black Boy
and Hindu spices in your house?

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:00.250
Well, if he doesn't like it, then I'm sure
we have a lot of curries that Shazam--

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.166
[Jashan] It's Jashan.

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:05.416
Okay? Not Shazam. Not Sasham. It's Jashan.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:07.083
[whispers] Jashan.

01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.000
What?

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:12.083
[in Norwegian] I'll go and get
some more sausages.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.458
-Are you done?
-Yes.

[whispering in English] Can you please
just try to fit in?

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:23.000
[loudly] Fit in?

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:24.916
[whispering] Sh. Like Hildegunn does.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.458
[softly] Like Hildegunn
who pretends like she has no personality

01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:29.708
so she can fit into
your Norwegian Christmas cult.

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:32.541
Christmas cult?

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:37.583
Yeah. Christmas cult, with your
crazy uniforms and your weird rituals.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:43.000
I'm not asking you to dye your hair blond
or to speak Norwegian.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:44.458
That's easier.

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.916
-[doorbell rings]
-I just want my family to be happy for us.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.833
Why would they be happy for us
if you force me to eat pork fat?

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.208
It's traditions.

01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:53.791
So is baby tossing
and human sacrifice and stoning.

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:56.625
Just because it's tradition
doesn't mean it's good.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.541
Oh.

01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:59.875
-[Anne-Lise in Norwegian] Thea?
-Yeah?

Can we please talk about this later?

01:05:02.916 --> 01:05:04.541
No, I am upset now.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.333
It's Christmas Eve.

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:08.541
And is that the answer for everything?

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:10.833
Why do atheists go to church?
It's Christmas.

01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:13.458
Why do we swim in ice water?
It's Christmas.

01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.500
Why do we hide our feelings?
It's Christmas.

What does it say on this one?

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.458
-To Aunt Thea.
-[in English] Of course.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.750
-[in Norwegian] Come on, Aunt Thea.
-You must come and get your present.

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:45.541
Yeah.

01:05:50.125 --> 01:05:51.083
Hmm.

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:55.500
Maybe you want to sit on Santa's lap?

01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:58.041
I think I'll stand.

01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:00.958
-You have to sit.
-Yes, you have to sit.

Have you been a good girl this year,
Aunt Thea?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.833
[in English] I'm sorry.
Am I the only one who finds this weird?

[cracking knuckles]

from Santa this year?

to fit in with your family,

to fit in with your traditions.

The difference is,
I would have had your back. [exhales]

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:13.208
I have your back.

01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:17.291
-[Jashan] Do you?
-Yeah.

01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:20.208
Or are you someone so obsessed
with making Christmas perfect

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:21.500
that you lost sight of me?

01:09:27.208 --> 01:09:28.125
[Thea] That's not true.

01:09:28.208 --> 01:09:30.333
Then why won't you tell your family
we're engaged?

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.416
[melancholy music playing]

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.666
[Jashan sighs]

01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:38.333
I was just waiting for the right moment.

01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:39.625
For who?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.833
For you?

01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:47.083
[exhales deeply]

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.000

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.625
So it didn't work out?

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:19.875
No, dude.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.875
[driver] It happens.

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:27.291
-So, listen to some music, or do you…
-[Jashan] I'm okay.

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:31.791
[driver] Yes. But we can be silent.
That's all. No problem.

[Thea in Norwegian]
Look at the nice colors.

01:12:22.666 --> 01:12:23.708
[Simen] Don't you want one?

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:26.416
Christmas as usual.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.833
Are you sad?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.375
No. You can't be sad on Christmas Eve.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:49.375
Where is Shazam?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.500
Well, he…

01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:58.333
He had to go home.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.666
Is he coming back?

01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:07.875
There are many presents left, Ronja.
Why don't you go get one more?

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:08.791
[Ronja] Sure.

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:24.916
[reading slowly] Merry Christmas, Thea.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.125
Merry Christmas, Thea.

From…

01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:30.375
Jashan.

01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:32.291
[all] Oh!

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.750
[paper rustling]

01:13:43.458 --> 01:13:45.125
Shazam is cool.

01:13:48.833 --> 01:13:49.666
Yes.

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.125
[voice breaks] He is actually really cool.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:57.791
Jesus Christ! [sniffles]

01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:03.083
But he beat up Santa.

01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:04.291
Aunt Thea.

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.041
[whispers] It wasn't Santa.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:12.833
It was just Jørgen who was pretending
because he is in love with you.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:14.083
[chuckles]

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't think
he's actually in love. [sniffles]

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:19.833
[whispers] Yes, he is.

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:21.500
He's in love.

01:14:24.416 --> 01:14:25.250
But…

01:14:26.958 --> 01:14:33.416
But Jashan ruined your song in church,
and you were so excited about it.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.041
Not really. I just sang because
Mom says that Grandma wants me to.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:40.750
[Hildegunn] No, Ronja.

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:43.666
[chuckling] It wasn't quite like that.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.000
Kids say the darnedest things.

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.375
I like it when the children sing.

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:55.333
I was thinking.
Your bunad is so beautiful.

01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:57.708
I think it's exquisite.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:58.833
I have to go.

01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:00.291
But it's Christmas Eve.

01:15:02.291 --> 01:15:05.000
-I don't give a shit.
-You can't say "shit."

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.166
I don't give a shit.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.708
-Where are you going?
-The airport.

01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:14.791
Sweetheart, are you sure…

01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:17.041
No, I'm not sure, Mom. I'm not.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.250
I just can't listen to you right now.

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:21.916
[breathes deeply]

01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:27.541
And I know you think that my relationship
with Jashan is just a phase

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:30.000
because I've messed around so much.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:34.583
But it isn't.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.375
[whispers] Maybe you should go and play
with your Christmas gifts.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:40.291
[Ronja] Okay.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.458
[Thea sobs]

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:45.750
I've just tried to make
everything right this Christmas

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.750
because I know it's important to you
and because

01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:51.125
I wanted to do it
like we always did it with Dad

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.291
to help Jashan fit in and… [sobs]

01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:57.041
And to make you like him.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:01.333
[sobs and laughs] But I've failed…

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:05.208
I have failed miserably.

01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:15.500
But it's not mine or Jashan's job
to make you like him.

01:16:16.166 --> 01:16:18.541
[breathes deeply]

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:22.125
[sniffles] This was supposed
to be happy news,

01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:25.458
but I might as well say it now
since everyone is in such great spirits.

01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:30.750
[sniffles]

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:32.083
I'm getting married.

01:16:33.291 --> 01:16:34.125
[Simen] Yes.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:36.458
[sobbing]

01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:38.958
Pretty stupid
to throw him out on Christmas Eve, then.

01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:41.083
-Simen!
-But it is.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:51.958
I'm sorry.

01:17:55.666 --> 01:17:58.791
When you dated Jørgen,

01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:03.666
I thought my life was perfect.

01:18:04.666 --> 01:18:08.458
You were supposed to live
in the house next door,

01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:13.083
and your kids were supposed to come
to our house to do homework

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:14.500
and eat cinnamon buns.

01:18:17.833 --> 01:18:19.208
But then, Dad died.

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:21.250
And you left.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:26.750
I'm the one who should say sorry.

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:29.708
I'm just afraid to lose you.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.833
I'm not going anywhere.

01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:35.708
[Anne-Lise] Yes, you are.

01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:38.500

you don't drink alcohol on Christmas Eve.

You didn't all have to come with me.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:51.125
Of course we had to come.
We all have to apologize.

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:53.375
Can we please slow down a bit?

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:56.083
We are on our way to the airport
on Christmas Eve.

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:59.750
We're getting her fiancé. This is the most
romantic thing I've ever experienced.
