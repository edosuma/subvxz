They've labeled him
as a rogue officer.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.575
Here are pictures of bodnar

Leaving the
United States.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.496
Yaniv? Ilan's brother.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.198
Using an alias, yaniv boarded
the plan to rome

00:33.200 --> 00:35.200
And bodnar stayed in the u.S.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.668
You know how much manpower
we wasted

00:36.670 --> 00:38.103
Looking for bodnar in rome?

00:38.105 --> 00:39.772
Let everyone
take the wild-goose chase

00:39.774 --> 00:44.043

guard down in the United States.

His payment for helping bodnar.

Let's look
inside the suv.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.242
Okay, so...

09:37.244 --> 09:39.110
The crash was definitely
premeditated.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.111
There was a

09:40.113 --> 09:41.713
Four-point harness
installed,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.315
And the air bag was removed.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.983
Why would he
remove the airbag?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.118
Where is the mcrt truck?
Um,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.220
It's, uh...

09:49.222 --> 09:52.123
Would you believe me

09:52.125 --> 09:54.059
Out being serviced?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.293
You're a
very bad liar.

No. Sorry, ms. Gillis.
It's a crime scene.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.108
I just can't believe that this
has happened... To my house.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.243
How long has mr. Miller
been renting from you?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.112
Um, a little
over two years.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.181
I almost didn't, though,
'cause he showed up

10:16.183 --> 10:18.283
On that big, noisy motorcycle.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.918
I hate motorcycles.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.386
He still have that motorcycle?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.121
Uh, he was working on it
out in the garage

10:23.123 --> 10:24.923
Last time I drove out
to collect the rent.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.360

for a living?

10:28.362 --> 10:29.361
No.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.762
He traveled a lot, though.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.297
Sometimes two,
three months.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.032
If he knew he was gonna
be gone that long,

10:34.034 --> 10:36.368
He paid me in advance. In cash.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.336
I don't know if I'm gonna find
a tenant like that again.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.005
When was the last time
you saw him?
First of the month.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.072
When I collected the rent.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.273
You ever see this man?

10:42.275 --> 10:43.775
Nope.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.276
But that doesn't mean
he wasn't here.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.145
I haven't been inside since
I leased the place to miller.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.146
Okay.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.748
Thank you.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.783
We'll give you a call
if we have any more questions.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.251
Well, I got a question.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.420
Who pays for
all the damage?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.122
Someone from
the agency

10:57.124 --> 10:58.289
Will be by to contact you.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.162
Hey.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.664
What are you
doing here?

11:05.666 --> 11:06.998
Ziva:
Same thing
you would do

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
If someone tried
to kill you, gibbs.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.701
Bodnar?

11:09.703 --> 11:11.836
No, no sign of him.
Who's that?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.405
We think the getaway driver.
Does he have a name?

11:13.407 --> 11:15.140
Only an alias.
Ducky: Well,
not to worry.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.710
Fingerprints aren't the only
means of I.D.'ing a body.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.812
We have facial
recognition,

11:20.814 --> 11:22.280
Dental records, dna

11:22.282 --> 11:24.883
And a whole host
of other methods.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.352
And all I need
is a little quality time

11:27.354 --> 11:28.953
With our patient.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.122
Found this in his pocket.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.157
"reisiger."

11:32.159 --> 11:35.827
You run into anybody
by that name in berlin?

11:35.829 --> 11:36.861
No.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.896
No.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.064
Uh, boss,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.332
Motorcycle's missing
from the garage,

11:41.334 --> 11:43.334
But I found this
above the workbench.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.969
Probably how bodnar got away.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.237
I'll put out a bolo.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.239
Morrow:
<i>Why didn't you alert me</i>

11:48.241 --> 11:50.308
Before the raid on the house?

11:50.310 --> 11:54.279
Gibbs felt, and I agreed,
that time was of the essence.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.880
What would you
have done?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.215
Bodnar rammed
dinozzo's car.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.984
Almost killed two agents,
and he stole the diamonds.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.821
Come on, tom, how many years
did gibbs work for you?

12:02.823 --> 12:06.091
Given leeway,
he gets results.
The only result

12:06.093 --> 12:09.060
We have now is a dead
body you can't identify.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.829
If bodnar is
still here,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.431
It's homeland and the fbi
that have to track him down,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.300
Not ncis.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.269
I spent years
in this office,

12:18.271 --> 12:20.805
Sitting in that chair.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.108
I have a great affection
for this agency.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.176
I don't want to see
it compromised.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.244
Nor do I.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.913
You are the director
of ncis, leon.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.249
You have a personal stake
in catching bodnar.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.052
Your agency has
to keep a distance.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.222
(ziva speaking hebrew)

12:37.224 --> 12:39.891
(ziva continues in hebrew)

12:39.893 --> 12:41.292
(ziva laughs)

12:41.294 --> 12:42.494
(speaks hebrew)

12:42.496 --> 12:44.763
That was my contact,

12:44.765 --> 12:46.231
Adam eshel, at shin bet.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.432
Israel's internal
security agency

12:47.434 --> 12:50.268
Has nothing
on anyone named reisiger.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.870
Same thing
with interpol and fbi.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.304
Got zip on their
databases.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.873
Closest thing
I could find

12:54.875 --> 12:56.007
Was a reissinger,

12:56.009 --> 12:58.109
Spelled with two
s's and an "n."

12:58.111 --> 12:59.210
Frieda. 92.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.445
A nazi collaborator.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.780
Tony:
One thing you can say

13:01.782 --> 13:03.314
About bodnar-- he sure
pays his help well.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.784
Abbs, tell him what
those four uncut
diamonds are worth.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.986
There's a total
of 18 carats,

13:07.988 --> 13:09.320
All rated a vvs-1

13:09.322 --> 13:11.122
At least,
and the gemologist

13:11.124 --> 13:12.423
I consulted with

13:12.425 --> 13:14.959
Said they'd be worth
at least $75,000.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.896
Because they're harder to trace.
Abby:
Yeah,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.898
A cut diamond can be plotted
like a fingerprint,

13:19.900 --> 13:22.433
And they sometimes
have laser inscriptions.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.469
Can you imagine what that
whole pouch we brought back

13:24.471 --> 13:25.837
From berlin must be worth?

13:25.839 --> 13:26.871
Abby:
Oh, right, berlin!

13:26.873 --> 13:29.407
I didn't get to ask.
How'd it go?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.510
"go"?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.545
(phone rings)

13:33.547 --> 13:35.180
Tony:
Ooh. Yeah.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.881
It's my auto insurance company.

13:36.883 --> 13:41.052
And just sort of pretend
to be my secretary or something?

13:41.054 --> 13:41.886
Ziva:
Don't be a child.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.188
Just pick it up.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.091
Abby, would you?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.929
Abby:
Agent dinozzo's office.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.230
How can I help you?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.932
Woman:
May I speak to mr. Dinozzo?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.601
He's not available right now.
Can I take a message?

13:56.603 --> 13:58.303
(woman speaking indistinctly
over phone)

13:58.305 --> 13:59.904
That's...
That's pretty... Harsh.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.039
Harsh?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.007
Abby:
You need to be a little more

14:03.009 --> 14:04.042
Sympathetic, okay?

14:04.044 --> 14:07.078
This has been
very... Traumatic.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.080
I don't like your tone!

14:09.082 --> 14:10.515
Ooh. Just take a message.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.386
Why don't I have
mr. Dinozzo

14:15.388 --> 14:18.256
Call you back
at   <i>hi</i>convenience.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.393
Okay. I'll tell him.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.964
Great. Thanks.
Tell me what?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.131
They're canceling your policy.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.299
What?
If you don't

14:28.301 --> 14:30.268
Call them back in 24 hours.
Oh!

14:30.270 --> 14:31.870
Come on!

14:31.872 --> 14:33.471
This is such
a nightmare!

14:33.473 --> 14:36.241
(angry grunting)
what am I supposed to do?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.476
I got no car.
I need wheels.
Mcgee, you're

14:38.478 --> 14:43.147
I'm sorry, is that your way
of asking for a favor?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.983
And pick me up
in the morning.
(groans)

14:44.985 --> 14:46.918
You are aware this city
has an excellent

14:46.920 --> 14:48.253
Public transportation system?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.420
(groans)

14:49.422 --> 14:52.891
Any idea who he is?

14:52.893 --> 14:54.525
I must apologize

14:54.527 --> 14:57.962
For my unbridled optimism
this morning, jethro.

14:57.964 --> 15:01.399
I am no closer to identifying
this man now than before.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.967
Abby ran

15:02.969 --> 15:05.136
His dna, and she
came up empty.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.138
This guy's had
more plastic surgery

15:07.140 --> 15:10.008
Than joan rivers
and cher combined.
That is

15:10.010 --> 15:13.912
An inappropriate remark,
mr. Palmer, however accurate.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.546
This man has gone
to great lengths

15:15.548 --> 15:17.515
To conceal
his identity.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.084
Besides removing
his fingerprints,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.987
All of the key parameters
for facial recognition

15:22.989 --> 15:26.057
Have been surgically altered--
shape of his nose,

15:26.059 --> 15:28.259
The length
of his chin...

15:28.261 --> 15:31.029
He's even had the contour
and length of his ears changed.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.231
In recent years,
ears have proven

15:33.233 --> 15:35.600
To be a more unique I.D.
Than fingerprints.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.937
They have a 96.6%
degree of accuracy.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.471
How about good
old-fashioned
dental records?

15:40.473 --> 15:41.606
Oh, useless in this case.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.977
By full-mouth
dental implants.
Jimmy: Yeah, this guy's

15:45.979 --> 15:47.545
Even had a tattoo
removed over here.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.715
I'm sorry to sound
so discouraging, jethro,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.951
But... I can
assure you

15:52.953 --> 15:56.054
We will continue to work on him.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.357
You can't hide
from me

15:59.359 --> 16:00.959
Forever.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.709
Mcgee:
I pulled the utility records
from miller's rental house

16:17.711 --> 16:19.410
For the past six months.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.280
This is a graph of water,
power and gas consumption.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.614
As you can see,

16:23.616 --> 16:25.450
Three months ago,
all three rose sharply,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.552
Suggesting an added person
was residing there.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.354
And I found bodnar's
fingerprints everywhere.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.588
And there's more clues,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.190
Indicating he was
there for some time.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.759
I pulled bodnar's dna
off the lip of that mug.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.628
What is that
in the bottom, mold?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.431
<i>Dictyostelium discoideum.</i>

16:40.433 --> 16:42.633
It's a slime mold.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.635
And it takes about
two months to grow.

16:44.637 --> 16:48.072
That tells me that bodnar
was there at least that long.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.241
They didn't wash the cup?
No.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.343
Pretty gross.
I don't think the roomies

16:52.345 --> 16:54.579
Are gonna win any awards
for good housekeeping.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.280
And they had
a visitor.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.449
Yes, I pulled a fingerprint
off that bottle.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.253
Amir mantel.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.521
The mossad agent who was

17:03.523 --> 17:04.722
So unceremoniously
delivered

17:04.724 --> 17:06.758
To me in the trunk of his car.

17:06.760 --> 17:11.295
Well, that confirms that he and
bodnar were working together.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.075
(gasps in pain)

17:24.077 --> 17:25.610
(panting)

17:28.580 --> 17:30.615
(exhales)

17:30.617 --> 17:32.683
(sighs)

17:35.487 --> 17:36.621
(sighs)

17:36.623 --> 17:38.056
(hisses in pain)

17:38.058 --> 17:39.657
(exhales)

17:39.659 --> 17:41.592
(grunts)

17:42.561 --> 17:43.694
(grunts)

17:43.696 --> 17:45.263
(panting)

17:45.265 --> 17:46.531
(grunts)

18:00.379 --> 18:01.612
If you don't
like my rules,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.681
You can find someone
else to drive you in.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.349
All I wanted
was to stop for coffee.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.484
I was willing to treat.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.119
No one eats or
drinks in my car.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.354
Well, I guess sex
is out of the question.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.190
For...

18:12.192 --> 18:13.724
Your car rides
really stiff.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.126
My car rides fine, tony.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.260
You were in an accident.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.628
My cadillac
is like a cloud.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.597
It's roomy and soft.
(phone ringing)

18:19.599 --> 18:20.665
Okay, you know what?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.300
Find yourself
another ride.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.534
Uh, it's for you, mcgee.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.336
Please pick it up.
It's driving me insane.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.238
Special agent mcgee.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.543
He was, uh, trying
to do you a favor,

18:32.545 --> 18:33.611
Wise guy.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.712
How are you gonna get to work?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.714
(groans)
I'll figure something out.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.587
I'm not that far
out of <i>your</i> way.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.722
Start my mornings
riding in with you?

18:44.724 --> 18:45.590
Well.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.758
(chuckling)

18:49.428 --> 18:50.528
Hey.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.897
Why don't you take my mini

18:52.899 --> 18:54.632
For the next couple of days?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.766
You kidding?
No.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.502
I'm gonna start jogging to work.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.670
Just please don't total it.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.307
Jog? Aren't you sore?
I can hardly move.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.475
I'm fine.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.344
Hey. What happened?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.914
Nothing.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.349
That's not from the accident.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.683
Hey...

19:14.453 --> 19:17.188
Thank you, boss.
What's this for?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.556
You drove in with mcgee.

19:19.691 --> 19:20.691
(sniffs)

19:20.693 --> 19:22.660
That was metro.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.694
They found
the motorcycle

19:23.696 --> 19:25.496
A block from union station.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.698
Bodnar's on the move.
He has left dc.
Get the bike to abby.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.268
Get security footage
from the train station.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.772
I can't believe
how fast this year has gone.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.707
You know, mine and breena's
first anniversary

19:36.709 --> 19:38.209
Is only in a couple weeks.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.811
The pressure's on.
What should I get her?

19:40.813 --> 19:43.648
Well, one of the benefits
of bachelorhood, mr. Palmer:

19:43.650 --> 19:45.750
I don't have
such problems.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.618
Ah, jethro,
it's good you're here.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.689
Mr. Palmer and I finally have a
lead on mr. Miller's identity.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.391
The plastic surgeon

19:53.393 --> 19:54.692
Who altered his face

19:54.694 --> 19:58.329
Did a mentoplasty
using a silicon prosthesis

19:58.331 --> 19:59.864
That reshaped his jaw.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.332
What's more, he

20:01.334 --> 20:03.434
Elongated
the mandibular ramus.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.437
That's a mouthful.
(chuckles)

20:06.439 --> 20:09.440
The, uh, fda requires
that all devices can be tracked

20:09.442 --> 20:10.741
In case there's a recall.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.876
Yeah, well, here it is.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.978
It has a...

20:13.980 --> 20:16.781
Serial number on it.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.783
I believe you, duck.
No.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.386
Jimmy:
Abby contacted the manufacturer,
who gave her

20:22.388 --> 20:24.822
The name of the surgeon
who installed the device.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.891
A dr. Madison
fielding.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.896
(phone ringing)

20:33.332 --> 20:35.399
Woman:
Dr. Fielding's office.
Please hold.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.706
Can I ask you a question?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.407
Sure.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.809
Why'd you wait so long?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.310
I'm sorry?

20:46.312 --> 20:47.712
To get your nose done.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.414
You're, like...
Older than my father.

20:53.685 --> 20:57.822
(chuckles)
wipe the smirk off
your face, mcgee.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.391
Gentlemen, the doctor
will see you now.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.829
Wipe that smirk
off your face, tony.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.998
Well...

21:09.801 --> 21:10.835
Woman:
<i>Dr. Fielding,</i>

21:10.837 --> 21:12.703
These are the ncis agents.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.871
Thank you, jessica.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.573
Thank you, jessica.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.907
(chuckling):
Wow.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.809
Wow. She's beautiful.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.944
Some of my best work.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.546
Special agents
mcgee and dinozzo.
Ah.

21:22.548 --> 21:25.049
Carl miller was killed
in a shoot-out?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.050
What happened?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.818
It's still under investigation.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.420
When did you do his surgery?

21:29.422 --> 21:31.289
Well, after your call,
I pulled up his file.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.957
It was just
over three years ago.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.859
I did a lot of work
on mr. Miller.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.795
Nothing really. He was
quite a... Good-looking guy.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.830
But you did it.
Well,

21:39.832 --> 21:43.868
Some people have unwarranted
poor self-images of themselves.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.803
I'm here to help.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.306
Mr. Miller was quite insistent.
Let me guess.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.308
No insurance.
He paid in cash.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.475
Did you take
photographs

21:51.477 --> 21:52.743
Of him before the surgery?

21:52.745 --> 21:53.744
Yeah, I always do.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.813
Could we see 'em?
Certainly.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.851
Oh, wow. You completely
changed his appearance.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.454
That's what he wanted--
to look different.

22:04.956 --> 22:09.493
Uh, those are the, uh,
newest saline implants.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.661
Do you want to feel one?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.830
Yes.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.865
Oh, dear.
Mcgee:
Him wanting

22:14.867 --> 22:16.667
To look different didn't
raise any flags with you?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.469
Well, maybe in hindsight, yeah.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.338
Could you e-mail me
those photographs?

22:20.340 --> 22:22.540
Absolutely.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.509
And, uh, what happened to you?

22:25.511 --> 22:28.612
Ah. A car accident.
Just a little cut.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.881
Want me to take a look
at it? Pro bono?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.650
Well, we don't want it
to leave a scar.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.118
Sure.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.721
Touch it.
No.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.989
(typing)

22:44.730 --> 22:46.864
Bodnar's calling me.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.402
Record it.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.471
(typing)

22:54.806 --> 22:57.441
Hello, ziva.

22:57.443 --> 23:00.578
We're making a habit
of meeting like this.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.880
I'm glad to see you're at work
and not seriously injured.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.115
I was worried.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.649
I doubt that.

23:05.651 --> 23:06.951
You care only about yourself.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.954
We've known each other
since childhood.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.822
You know that isn't true.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.824
You've changed, ilan.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.826
You used yaniv.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.696
Your brother now sits
in an american jail.

23:20.665 --> 23:22.800
Ours is a strange business.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.935
It's changed us both.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.937
Could those two children
ever have imagined

23:26.939 --> 23:28.939
That one would kill
her own brother,

23:28.941 --> 23:30.608
And the other his mentor?

23:30.610 --> 23:32.777
He was your mentor, all right.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.779
But he was my father.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.614
And he was trying
to bring peace.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.150
Eli was taking mossad
and our country

23:39.152 --> 23:41.485
In a dangerous direction.

23:41.487 --> 23:44.688
He was selling us out to iran.
It had to be stopped.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.023
Are you calling me
to tell me that, ilan?

23:46.025 --> 23:51.162
No. There is something
that you and ncis must know.

23:51.164 --> 23:54.999
As much as I didn't like
or trust arash kazmi,

23:55.001 --> 23:56.901
I did not kill him.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.437
There are others
who are responsible

23:59.439 --> 24:02.606
For the assassination
of your father's iranian friend.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.677
Good-bye, ziva.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.612
This is the last time
we'll talk.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.182
No, it's not.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.451
I will find you.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.630
So, did you earn this, abbs?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.165
Oh, yes.
What do you got?

24:28.167 --> 24:31.135
I ran facial recognition
on miller's pre-op photo,

24:31.137 --> 24:33.671
And I got a match to a
south african passport.

24:33.673 --> 24:37.575
It's with great displeasure
that I introduce you to

24:37.577 --> 24:40.244
Clive goddard,
a bad man.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.247
A really, really bad man.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.584
He's a mercenary that's involved
in blood-diamond smuggling.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.586
He disappeared in
angola four years ago,

24:48.588 --> 24:50.254
So interpol and the
south african police

24:50.256 --> 24:51.655
Had presumed him dead.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.924
Thanks.
Wait. I need a favor.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.060
What? Caf-pow!
Wasn't enough?

24:56.062 --> 24:58.529
I want these filthy things
out of my lab.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.164
Would you book them
into evidence, please?

25:00.166 --> 25:03.234
I mean, men, women and children

25:03.236 --> 25:06.937
Were tortured and-and died
mining those blood diamonds,

25:06.939 --> 25:09.006
And I... I don't want
to touch them again.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.741
I'll have dorneget
pick 'em up, okay?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.877
Thank you.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.714
Vance:
What's his connection to bodnar?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.282
Tony:
We're thinking
maybe diamonds.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.584
Gibbs, you believe bodnar's
claim that he didn't kill kazmi?

25:20.586 --> 25:22.286
Why would he lie?
Do we tell morrow?

25:22.288 --> 25:23.654
Mcgee:
Boss, I got something.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.991
With bodnar--
I enhanced the background and

25:26.993 --> 25:29.760
Look at the deciduous trees.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.795
The leaves
are in full bloom.

25:31.797 --> 25:35.900
Ahead of washington, dc and
the rest of the east coast.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.835
It's unique to new york city.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.670
And why is that?
Because of the heat

25:39.672 --> 25:41.205
From the surrounding buildings
and the subway system,

25:41.207 --> 25:42.840
The seasons in new york
are altered.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.742
Trees lose their leaves
later and bloom earlier.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.777
You think
bodnar's in new york?
Yeah, I do.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.778
And there's this, as well.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.047
These lampposts
were designed

25:50.049 --> 25:51.649
Especially for
central park

25:51.651 --> 25:53.117
By henry bacon in 1907.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.252
The same guy who designed
the lincoln memorial.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.921
Makes sense
that's where bodnar is.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.923
If you wanted
to convert diamonds into cash,

25:58.925 --> 26:01.792
There's no better place than
new york's diamond district.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.962
There's a diamond broker
or company named reisiger

26:04.964 --> 26:06.030
In new york.
Yep.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.803
You and I have
to let homeland handle this.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.808
Understood?

26:25.917 --> 26:26.951
What's so important?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.118
We have reason to believe

26:28.120 --> 26:29.887
That bodnar
is in new york city, tom.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.823
You disappoint me.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.992
I thought
we had an understanding.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.194
Ncis was going
to stay out of this.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.029
Bodnar contacted us.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.831
Special agent david,
to be exact.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.833
Did he tell her
he was in new york?
Gibbs: No.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.069
No. We were able
to analyze the transmission

26:45.071 --> 26:47.204
And determine he was calling
from central park.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.640
Our guess is he's trying
to launder the diamonds.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.041
And what was the purpose
of the call?

26:51.043 --> 26:53.043
He and agent david
go way back, tom.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.646
I'm guessing remorse
for killing her father.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.648
Well, I appreciate
you making this call.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.783
Homeland has a major presence
in new york.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.118
We'll take it from here.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.319
He's all yours, tom.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.289
You didn't tell him
about kazmi.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.324
No, I didn't.
Why?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.627
Because I'm not sure
bodnar didn't kill him.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.162
Why pass on
unsubstantiated information?

27:13.131 --> 27:14.865
Leon?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.936
There's something else.

27:18.938 --> 27:23.974
Yeah, I'm a little disappointed
it's not us taking bodnar down.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.211
You can relate to that,
can't you, gibbs?

27:34.686 --> 27:36.687
You really gonna run home?

27:36.689 --> 27:37.821
I could give you a ride.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.056
I'm in training, mcgee.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.224
Training? For what?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.094
Still can't believe
you let tony borrow your car.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.130
It's just a car,
a material possession.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.398
(chuckles)

27:47.400 --> 27:49.033
I have no emotional attachment
to it.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.034
Why are you two still here?

27:50.036 --> 27:52.236
I was actually waiting for you.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.338
I think I found something.
Mcgee?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.939
Yeah.

27:55.941 --> 27:56.940
A connection
between bodnar,

27:56.942 --> 27:59.777
Amir mantel and clive goddard.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.979
Adam eshel accessed
shin bet files for me

28:01.981 --> 28:03.914
And found
an interesting photo.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.282
The two men were working

28:05.284 --> 28:07.284
For the south african mercenary
in angola.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.186
Looks like
they've stayed in touch.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.888
When was this
photo taken?
Five years ago.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.358
That were being used
to finance terrorist activity.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.859
That's good work, ziva.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.395
Come on, let's go home,
get some rest.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.297
You, too, mcgee.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.167
I will.
Uh, just checking on something.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.236
(typing)

28:34.145 --> 28:36.346
(footsteps approaching)

28:39.217 --> 28:41.785
Brought back
your plunger.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.159
You've had it for two years.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.895
Why now, dinozzo,
in the middle of the night,

28:51.897 --> 28:54.498
You have a burning desire
to return my plunger?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.367
It's just an excuse to talk
to you about something.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.236
After all these years,
you need an excuse?

29:00.839 --> 29:02.906
I'm worried about ziva.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.876
Why?

29:05.878 --> 29:08.078
How about she let
me use her car?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.114
Which is actually
pretty good.

29:10.116 --> 29:11.815
It drives better
than you'd think,

29:11.817 --> 29:13.784
And it's pretty roomy
on the inside.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.055
After eli's death,
I noticed it.

29:20.191 --> 29:23.827
She became secretive,
more focused.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.530
Ziva wants...

29:26.532 --> 29:28.398
Revenge? Yeah, I know that.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.803
She's not gonna
let it go, boss.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.906
It's out of her hands now.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.908
Speaking of her hands--
did you notice her knuckles?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.777
No.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.179
How was she in berlin?

29:42.181 --> 29:44.248
(sighs)

29:47.852 --> 29:50.287
Anything you didn't tell me
about berlin?

29:55.059 --> 29:57.361
(cell phone ringing)

30:07.372 --> 30:09.373
Boss, I'm really sorry.
I screwed up.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.442
I sensed something
was wrong, and I was right.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.011
I don't know how
I could be so stupid.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.279
Get to the
point, mcgee.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.080
We were played by bodnar.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.816
He set up a trap,
and I fell right into it.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.920
He knew that we'd try
and analyze the call to ziva

30:22.922 --> 30:24.121
And determine where he was,

30:24.123 --> 30:26.023
So I did exactly
what he wanted me to do.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.457
I analyzed the background.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.060
Let me show you something.
Look at this.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.262
I created an algorithm
comparing the background

30:32.264 --> 30:35.132
Behind bodnar to recently
posted videos on cybervid.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.967
Found this video.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.837
It's gotten over 10,000
hits in the last few days.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.171
It's the same background.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.206
Yup, and watch what happens

30:42.208 --> 30:44.141
When I run them simultaneously.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.346
That dog's pretty good.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.115
He leaps in both images
at the exact same time.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.184
Bodnar wanted to make it look
like he was in new york.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.186
He matted himself
into the video.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.522
Now I have no idea where he is.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.869
Why am I the only one
here on time?

31:11.871 --> 31:14.004
Something came up.
We had to come back.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.139
Gibbs, mcgee and I
were here until 6:00 a.M.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.008
Never got to bed.
Just went home to change.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.176
Why was I not called?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.011
I'd say ask mcgee, but don't.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.881
He's beating himself up.
What happened?

31:23.883 --> 31:25.482
He realized bodnar
staged his call to you.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.150
He wanted us to think
he was in new york,

31:27.152 --> 31:28.619
And poor timmy took the bait.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.154
(sighs)

31:31.156 --> 31:34.491
Ilan was always very smart
and devious.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.093
He fill you in?

31:36.095 --> 31:37.427
Just met with vance.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.029
He's calling
tom morrow

31:39.031 --> 31:41.331
To explain we sent homeland
on a wild-goose chase.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.532
Not a call I'd want to make.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.368
So we're back
to square one.
Yep.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.004
Going to have to revisit every
clue, every shred of evidence.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.139
Damn. Ducky's
not picking up.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.674
He's releasing
clive goddard's body

31:50.676 --> 31:52.409
To south african authorities.
Dinozzo, go down

31:52.411 --> 31:53.911
And stop him.
On my way.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.312
Ziva, get abby
in the loop.

32:01.986 --> 32:04.254
Time to get you ready to travel.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.256
My assistant, mr. Palmer,

32:06.258 --> 32:08.191
Is preparing the remains
as we speak.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.227
You can pick them up
at your convenience.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.929
Yes, that-that
would be fine.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.463
<i>Baie danke.</i>

32:13.465 --> 32:16.967
Did you just say,
"buy a donkey?"

32:16.969 --> 32:19.303
No, tony.
I was speaking afrikaans,

32:19.305 --> 32:21.972
The official language
of south africa.

32:21.974 --> 32:24.608
Baie danke simply means,
"thank you very much."

32:24.610 --> 32:28.111
I was making arrangements
with their embassy to pick up

32:28.113 --> 32:30.647
Mr. Goddard here.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.616
Flag on the play, ducky.
Gonna have to hold off.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.519
We're not releasing the body?
Not yet.

32:36.721 --> 32:37.721
Sorry.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.057
Afrikaans,

32:40.059 --> 32:41.058
Dr. Mallard.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.292
You never cease
to amaze me.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.660
No, I don't speak
the language.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.629
Just a few key phrases.

32:45.631 --> 32:49.132
I lectured at the university
of pretoria one summer

32:49.134 --> 32:52.135
On anatomical, clinical
and forensic pathology.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.305
My students used to
call me "dr. Eend."

32:55.307 --> 32:56.473
(chuckles)

32:56.475 --> 32:59.142
<i>Eend</i> is the afrikaans
for "duck."

32:59.144 --> 33:01.478
Interesting.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.747
That note that we found
in goddard's pocket.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.683
"see reisiger 19."

33:06.685 --> 33:08.318
We didn't know that he
was south african then.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.021
It is possible that those words
are afrikaans?

33:11.023 --> 33:13.023
Quite possibly.
It sounds germanic dutch,

33:13.025 --> 33:16.226
From which the afrikaans
language is derived.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.361
You know what, I have

33:17.363 --> 33:19.529
A translation app on my phone.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.098
I got it when we were planning

33:21.100 --> 33:22.199
To honeymoon in europe.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.167
Never got to go.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.536
Let's see if it has "afrikans."

33:26.538 --> 33:28.672
<i>Kaans.</i> Afri-kaans.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.440
See if it has afri-kaans.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.144
Ah!

33:34.146 --> 33:35.312
I don't believe it. It does.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.147
Huh.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.349
Try <i>"reisiger."</i>

33:39.351 --> 33:41.118
Yep.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.353
Pronounced "rice-ih-gher."

33:43.355 --> 33:45.255
Means "voyager,"
"traveler."

33:45.257 --> 33:47.024
Tony:
How about <i>"see"?</i>

33:47.026 --> 33:48.091
S-e-e.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.794
Means... "sea."

33:50.796 --> 33:52.095
S-e-a.

33:52.097 --> 33:53.463
Like "ocean."

33:53.465 --> 33:55.265
Nice.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.067
You guys are the best.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.204
Vance:
<i>I'm sorry you feel</i>

34:01.206 --> 34:02.472
That way, tom, but the...

34:02.474 --> 34:05.609
Look, I hope you
keep me posted.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.110
I'm...

34:07.112 --> 34:09.279
All right, fine,
if that's the way you...

34:09.281 --> 34:11.448
(click, dial tone)

34:12.717 --> 34:14.584
He being a hard-ass?

34:14.586 --> 34:15.786
Morrow thinks we misled him.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.587
Sent him to new york
on purpose

34:17.589 --> 34:19.289
To get homeland
out of the picture.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.490
Eh, I know tom.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.225
He'll get over it.
Now he's threatened

34:22.227 --> 34:23.560
To go to the director
of national intelligence

34:23.562 --> 34:24.628
If we don't lay off.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.695
So, do we?

34:26.697 --> 34:28.165
Lay off?

34:29.133 --> 34:31.334
The man killed my wife, gibbs.

34:39.243 --> 34:43.180
Sea... Ocean...

34:43.182 --> 34:45.715
Voyager...

34:45.717 --> 34:49.186
Travel... 19,

34:49.188 --> 34:51.154
Whatever that could mean.

34:51.156 --> 34:52.255
Maybe it's a date.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.657
A flight number?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.725
(typing)

34:55.727 --> 34:57.160
Well, how about this?

34:57.162 --> 34:59.229
It's a freighter
with liberian registry

34:59.231 --> 35:01.098
Called <i>the ocean voyager.</i>

35:01.100 --> 35:02.199
Where'd you come up with that?

35:02.201 --> 35:03.567
Been running
the names of ships.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.235
Where is it?
It is...

35:05.237 --> 35:07.637
In the port of baltimore.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.172
And get this.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.674
It's docked at pier 19.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.776
Scheduled to leave for...

35:12.778 --> 35:15.445
Cape town,
south africa tonight.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.747
Tony:
So new york was a
misdirect to buy time.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.516
You redeemed yourself,
mcgoof-up.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.684
It is ironic.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.285
The diamonds go full circle.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.487
Back to africa,
where they can be

35:23.489 --> 35:24.821
Easily laundered.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.224
There are more uncut,
untraceable diamonds there

35:27.226 --> 35:29.326
Than anywhere else in the world.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.161
Wonder if bodnar learned
that from your father.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.195
Where's gibbs?

35:32.197 --> 35:33.697
With the director.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.565
We got to tell him.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.241
Hey, aren't you coming?

35:44.243 --> 35:45.742
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

36:13.938 --> 36:16.206
(car engine rumbles)

36:29.554 --> 36:31.621
(indistinct chatter)

36:47.972 --> 36:50.240
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

37:03.287 --> 37:05.488
(scraping)

37:23.007 --> 37:24.808
We got a fire!

37:24.810 --> 37:26.676
Somebody get an extinguisher!

37:26.678 --> 37:28.278
Man:
Call 911!

37:28.280 --> 37:29.913
(indistinct shouting)

37:45.496 --> 37:47.731
(men chatting indistinctly)

38:15.926 --> 38:17.761
(door opens)

38:24.001 --> 38:26.436
Bodnar:
Hey, hey, captain,
excuse me.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.939
I have a...
I have a question.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.408
Captain:
Yes, sir.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.444
What do you want?

38:34.446 --> 38:35.879
Bodnar:
Are we leaving on time?

38:35.881 --> 38:38.448
Captain:
I believe there might
be a slight delay, sir.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.450
What's the problem?

38:40.452 --> 38:41.985
I do not know--
the harbormaster

38:41.987 --> 38:43.486
Has put a hold
on our disembarking.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.854
I'm sure it's nothing.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.357
Thank you.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.636
Told you I would find you, ilan.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.938
You never give up.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.808
I've always admired that
about you, ziva.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.512
I could offer you a...

39:09.514 --> 39:11.815
A fortune in diamonds...

39:14.652 --> 39:17.454
...But I know better.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.955
They mean nothing to you.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.957
There is only one thing I want.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.828
I'm not going to stand trial
in this country.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.030
Nor am I going back to israel.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.936
You're just gonna
have to shoot me.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.437
You know I will.

39:37.074 --> 39:38.808
I also know you wouldn't

39:38.810 --> 39:40.844
Shoot an unarmed man
in the back.

39:40.846 --> 39:41.945
Ilan, stop.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.547
Ilan!

39:46.550 --> 39:49.152
(grunting)

39:51.589 --> 39:53.123
(groaning)

39:56.727 --> 40:00.029
(both grunting)

40:02.900 --> 40:04.067
(both grunt)

40:08.739 --> 40:11.641
(both grunting and groaning)

40:16.113 --> 40:17.080
(both grunt loudly)

40:20.151 --> 40:22.152
Tony:
That's her car.

40:24.555 --> 40:26.122
(grunting)

40:31.796 --> 40:33.830
(grunts loudly)

40:39.003 --> 40:40.136
(ziva grunts)

40:42.673 --> 40:44.507
(grunts)

40:45.709 --> 40:47.610
(grunting)

40:47.612 --> 40:50.013
Think that fire's ziva's doing?

40:53.951 --> 40:55.151
(yelling)

41:15.139 --> 41:17.907
♪

41:30.821 --> 41:32.889
(knocking)

41:32.891 --> 41:34.757
Come in.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.136
You all right?

41:54.111 --> 41:55.778
Is it over?

41:59.216 --> 42:02.218
It's over.

42:11.762 --> 42:15.164
