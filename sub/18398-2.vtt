00:00.048 --> 00:02.476
- Previously on Star...
- I met this girl on Instagram.

00:02.477 --> 00:03.999
She grew up in foster care,

00:04.001 --> 00:06.171
and everything she's been
through is in her voice.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.977
I need to make music that feeds my soul.

00:07.979 --> 00:09.210
And my music don't.

00:09.212 --> 00:11.116
- You want what?
- Simone's address.

00:11.118 --> 00:12.748
You're no better than
anybody else in this house.

00:12.750 --> 00:13.918
I never said I was.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.851
You're not getting any
information on a child

00:15.853 --> 00:18.721
in the system,
even if she was your sister.

00:18.723 --> 00:20.278
You killed him!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.324
- What if they come looking for us?
- They won't.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.012
We're gonna stop in Atlanta.

00:24.014 --> 00:25.427
There's this lady named Miss Carlotta.

00:25.429 --> 00:26.829
She's our godmother.

00:26.831 --> 00:28.564
The music we're making...
It's my new life.

00:28.566 --> 00:30.833
- Your parents cool with that?
- My mom's dead.

00:30.835 --> 00:32.601
I'm Derek. I live next
door to Miss Carlotta.

00:32.603 --> 00:34.468
I know where to find a manager.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.054
Girl, I'm gonna have to take you on.

00:36.056 --> 00:37.590
- That's Mary's kid.
- Who?

00:37.592 --> 00:39.760
Star.

00:39.762 --> 00:41.495
Stay away from those girls.

00:43.147 --> 00:46.126
I promised their
mother I'd take care of them.

00:46.150 --> 00:48.817
They got no idea to ride with the devil

00:48.819 --> 00:50.119
they're about to get on.

00:50.144 --> 00:52.774
We killed this.

00:52.799 --> 00:55.300
♪ Who shot ya? ♪

00:55.325 --> 00:57.993
- Simone, pass that.
- We did so dope, though.

00:57.995 --> 00:59.895
See, I put my balls on the line for you.

00:59.897 --> 01:01.330
I took a big chance.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.432
So now you all better
start listening to me,

01:03.434 --> 01:06.101
'cause I'm gonna manage you.

01:06.103 --> 01:07.836
You booked us at a house party, Jahil.

01:07.838 --> 01:10.172
It's not you got us
meetings with record execs.

01:10.197 --> 01:11.496
Damn, Alexandra.

01:11.521 --> 01:13.641
- Cold-blooded.
- Please let the man talk.

01:13.659 --> 01:15.558
- Oh, I will.
- No, no. It's cool.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.893
She's just running me through my paces.

01:16.895 --> 01:18.928
I can respect that.

01:18.930 --> 01:21.431
There's a big music festival
coming here to Atlanta,

01:21.433 --> 01:25.068
and it's got a Honda Stage,
and it's the perfect venue

01:25.070 --> 01:28.672
for me to introduce you to the world.

01:28.674 --> 01:30.536
So book us.

01:30.561 --> 01:31.975
There's steps to this thing.

01:31.977 --> 01:34.210
There's a radio contest, an EPK.

01:34.212 --> 01:37.447
You got to submit a demo,
and the deadline is in two days.

01:37.449 --> 01:40.750
- You ready for that, little girl?
- Yes.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.019
The question is, do you
have enough money?

01:43.021 --> 01:45.388
Or better yet, do you even
know how expensive they are?

01:45.390 --> 01:47.390
Oh, I know how much they cost.
I already booked a studio.

01:47.392 --> 01:48.992
Why don't you just worry about the music?

01:48.994 --> 01:51.928
Faith, Miss Atheist. Faith.

01:51.930 --> 01:54.998
Chile, bye. Look,
I'm about to go see Derek.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.423
Who's Derek?

01:56.448 --> 01:58.068
None of your business.

01:58.070 --> 02:00.270
Look, if you manage us,
show me the money.

02:00.272 --> 02:01.958
Please don't be late to the salon.

02:01.983 --> 02:04.083
I really don't want to
hear her mouth today.

02:05.410 --> 02:06.643
You ready to go? Let's go.

02:06.645 --> 02:08.377
I want to finish my chicken.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.381
You can bring it, babe.
Bring mine, too.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.364 --> 02:28.064
Oh...

02:28.066 --> 02:31.568
Oh.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.036
Oh.

02:33.038 --> 02:34.971
Where'd you learn how to do all that?

02:37.609 --> 02:40.410
I watch a lot of porn.

02:40.412 --> 02:43.012
Ew.

02:46.084 --> 02:47.450
I like you, Alexandra.

02:51.022 --> 02:52.455
Who are you?

02:55.594 --> 02:58.027
Oh, I got away from my father.

02:58.029 --> 03:01.831
It's a really bad situation,

03:01.833 --> 03:05.235
and I don't really want to talk about it.

03:05.237 --> 03:07.637
My mother's dead.

03:07.639 --> 03:11.474
I'm a singer-songwriter,
fresh from the Upper East Side.

03:12.554 --> 03:14.287
Well, my mom's dead, too.

03:16.515 --> 03:19.082
She died when I was seven.

03:19.084 --> 03:21.084
I'm sorry.

03:21.086 --> 03:23.787
It's fine now.

03:23.789 --> 03:25.655
Let's just say we got
something in common.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.060
Well, my dad was my hero.

03:31.062 --> 03:33.530
He was a cop.

03:33.532 --> 03:35.799
He was shot in the line
of duty when I was 12.

03:35.801 --> 03:39.402
I was raised to respect cops,

03:39.404 --> 03:41.571
that they were here to protect us.

03:43.909 --> 03:46.075
What's the matter?

03:46.077 --> 03:49.145
What's the matter?

03:49.147 --> 03:50.814
Who is it?

03:50.816 --> 03:53.249
- Who is that?
- It's...

03:53.251 --> 03:54.918
It's just Grams. It's...

03:54.920 --> 03:56.352
Who's in there?

03:56.354 --> 03:57.387
- She lives in the...
- Who is it?

03:57.389 --> 03:58.488
Go away, Grandma!

03:58.490 --> 03:59.622
She live in the front room.

03:59.624 --> 04:00.857
She is crazy.

04:00.859 --> 04:01.958
Who's in that bedroom, boy?

04:01.960 --> 04:03.793
Go away, Grandma, nobody!

04:03.795 --> 04:05.061
I hear voices.

04:05.063 --> 04:06.462
Got that girl in that room.

04:06.464 --> 04:07.964
Think I don't know what's going on.

04:10.202 --> 04:12.802
You're gonna make me fall
in love with you, girl.

04:12.804 --> 04:15.171
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really? Yes, really.

04:26.084 --> 04:29.018
Girl, I got a feeling
y'all gonna win this contest,

04:29.020 --> 04:31.721
and when you do,
you're gonna be wearing my clothes.

04:31.723 --> 04:33.957
No thanks, RuPaul.

04:33.959 --> 04:36.359
You got one more time to call me RuPaul.

04:36.361 --> 04:38.061
Look at the little sneak freak.

04:38.063 --> 04:39.195
I seen you come out that boy's house,

04:39.197 --> 04:41.464
walking funny. Nasty.

04:41.466 --> 04:43.967
How are y'all getting in this contest?

04:43.969 --> 04:45.368
We got to get a demo.

04:45.370 --> 04:49.505
What is this, some more of Jahil's mess?

04:49.507 --> 04:50.974
Jahil got us that gig
at his godson's house,

04:50.976 --> 04:53.943
and it went bananas.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.211
I really think y'all should work out

04:55.213 --> 04:57.080
whatever it is you need to work out.

04:57.082 --> 05:00.083
Stay out of my business,
and get back to work.

05:02.426 --> 05:04.160
Carlotta.

05:08.026 --> 05:09.626
Star?

05:11.463 --> 05:13.930
- Star, I...
- What's up?

05:13.932 --> 05:16.299
I've been thinking
about this contest and...

05:16.301 --> 05:17.800
you don't think people will see us?

05:17.802 --> 05:19.836
That's the point, Simone.

05:19.838 --> 05:21.137
Okay, you really don't think that

05:21.139 --> 05:22.805
nobody's coming looking for us?

05:24.442 --> 05:27.176
Excuse me, I'll rinse it in a second.

05:30.382 --> 05:32.982
I told you to stop talking like this.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.852
Okay, I keep getting these nightmares

05:35.854 --> 05:37.553
about him coming for us.

05:37.555 --> 05:40.723
I killed him, he's dead,
and he's not coming for us.

05:40.725 --> 05:42.392
Okay, I can feel it.

05:42.394 --> 05:44.193
I get it, but if you
keep talking like this,

05:44.195 --> 05:45.862
you're gonna get us in trouble.

05:50.312 --> 05:53.243
_

05:53.413 --> 05:55.459
_

05:55.678 --> 05:59.705
_

06:16.402 --> 06:19.768
Look, I'm in the middle of something.
Can we do this later?

06:20.315 --> 06:21.574
Now is good.

06:36.715 --> 06:39.277
I tell you to stay away from
Mary's kids, and you take them

06:39.302 --> 06:40.883
to that punk-ass godson of yours.

06:40.885 --> 06:42.518
That punk is worth 20 million a year.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.020
He can help with their career.

06:44.022 --> 06:45.621
Why are you doing this again?

06:45.623 --> 06:48.091
Because I got a gut feeling
about this, Lottie.

06:48.093 --> 06:51.294
Oh, yeah? Where did your
gut feeling get me and Mary?

06:56.134 --> 06:57.900
They need a manager like me.

06:57.902 --> 07:00.036
- Stop.
- You stop.

07:00.038 --> 07:02.472
You had those girls, and you lost them.

07:02.474 --> 07:03.873
They know that?

07:03.875 --> 07:05.641
They know why you lost them?

07:07.345 --> 07:11.481
Let them choose, Carlotta.
Let them choose.

07:12.884 --> 07:15.852
And Star, she's just like Mary, you know?

07:15.854 --> 07:17.687
Ain't nothing gonna stop her.

07:17.689 --> 07:21.124
Not unless you get her hooked
on drugs, like you did Mary.

07:21.126 --> 07:24.027
- That's a lie.
- I'll tell them, Jahil.

07:24.029 --> 07:29.899
I'll tell them exactly
what you did to Mary.

07:33.271 --> 07:35.338
I'm so sick of Miss Cotton, girl.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.040
Cotton, let me tell you
something, little girl.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.308
You're gonna stop screwing up
people's schedules around here.

07:39.310 --> 07:41.277
Especially mine, girl.
I don't play about my coins.

07:41.279 --> 07:43.880
You do your job and let me do mine.
Star, come here, baby.

07:43.882 --> 07:46.182
Let me holler at you for a second.

07:46.184 --> 07:47.817
I'm not about to sit here
and argue with your ugly ass.

07:47.819 --> 07:49.252
- I know that.
- You can't, 'cause you're not smart.

07:49.254 --> 07:51.454
You need to go brush that synthetic wig.

07:52.824 --> 07:55.691
Oh, my God. This is my song.

07:55.693 --> 07:56.926
How this your song, Alex, girl?

07:56.928 --> 07:58.261
You too young for this, honey.

07:58.263 --> 08:00.196
I used to dance to this when I was little.

08:00.198 --> 08:01.731
Thank you.

08:01.733 --> 08:04.033
Back in my day, baby,
we used to strike poses, honey,

08:04.035 --> 08:07.637
sell face, all the way on them, girl.

08:20.652 --> 08:23.853
Alexandra, stop acting like a monkey.

08:23.855 --> 08:26.222
I was just dancing like Madonna does.

08:26.224 --> 08:27.590
Sit down.

08:27.592 --> 08:28.858
Now!

08:28.860 --> 08:30.632
But you and daddy dance.

08:30.657 --> 08:32.171
Enough of that mouth of yours.

08:32.196 --> 08:33.796
You never let me have any fun

08:33.798 --> 08:35.398
because you don't have any fun.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.666

10:46.567 --> 10:48.885
So, your dad is one of the
biggest stars on the planet

10:48.887 --> 10:51.287
and you just didn't feel
like talking about it?

10:51.289 --> 10:53.223
Why would you lie about that?

10:53.225 --> 10:55.392
To keep from having
conversations like this one.

10:55.394 --> 10:56.926
You poor thing.

10:56.928 --> 10:58.294
So, how rich are you, then?

11:04.253 --> 11:05.853
So, that's the white girl.

11:14.446 --> 11:17.580
I mean, you are white.

11:21.086 --> 11:22.652
Pack your stuff.

11:22.654 --> 11:23.887
Really?

11:23.889 --> 11:25.121
Dad, I'm 19.

11:25.123 --> 11:26.589
And still using my credit cards.

11:26.591 --> 11:27.991
I'm supporting you.

11:27.993 --> 11:29.526
Contacting my friends,

11:29.528 --> 11:31.261
trying to find out if some local manager

11:31.263 --> 11:33.096
is worth repping you.

11:33.121 --> 11:34.828
How do you think that makes me look?

11:34.830 --> 11:37.397
As always, it's about you.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.100
You were checking up on Jahil?

11:40.102 --> 11:42.068
Yeah, and?

11:46.375 --> 11:49.142
Ain't nobody trying to listen to you.

11:49.144 --> 11:51.545
I go away for two weeks

11:51.547 --> 11:53.180
and you pull this one.

11:53.182 --> 11:55.949
You're drinking again.

11:55.951 --> 11:57.684
Well, what do you think?

11:57.686 --> 12:00.087
You had me scared,
disappearing like this.

12:00.112 --> 12:02.322
Look, I came to Atlanta

12:02.324 --> 12:04.191
to work on my music.

12:04.193 --> 12:05.725
You didn't even tell Mariesol.

12:05.727 --> 12:07.194
That better not be a maid.

12:08.630 --> 12:10.330
Oh, damn it is.

12:10.332 --> 12:11.698
You have bad roots,

12:11.700 --> 12:13.533
you insolent hussy.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.174
What we got going here?

12:21.176 --> 12:22.876
Girl, watch out, 'cause it's messy.

12:22.878 --> 12:25.445
I already
said I'm wasn't going.

12:25.447 --> 12:26.981
I'm not about to talk about this

12:27.006 --> 12:28.539
- anymore, Mom.
- Darling, please.

12:29.743 --> 12:31.051
I'm Carlotta.

12:31.053 --> 12:32.986
I own this salon.

12:32.988 --> 12:36.256
This... is my mother.

12:36.258 --> 12:37.958
We're here to take her home.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.161
Do you always take in
little girls to you house?

12:41.163 --> 12:43.096
Mom, she's been good to me, okay?

12:43.098 --> 12:46.900
We're staying at The W until tonight.

12:46.902 --> 12:48.935
Don't let that plane leave without you.

12:48.937 --> 12:51.438
Oh, it will. And I'll be just fine.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.840
All right, what? I mean, you
want to talk about your music?

12:53.842 --> 12:55.442
- What?
- We did.

12:55.444 --> 12:58.278
You know we did.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.480
And you said exactly what you had to say.

13:00.482 --> 13:03.617
Be on that plane.

13:06.126 --> 13:09.327
Come to your senses, darling, please.

13:15.063 --> 13:18.298
Okay, Alexandra.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.566
Explain.

13:19.568 --> 13:21.234
What do I need to explain?

13:21.236 --> 13:22.444
Look at them.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.938
He just asked you to
talk about your music.

13:24.940 --> 13:26.772
He doesn't care about my music.

13:26.797 --> 13:29.643
Are you thinking about all of us?

13:29.645 --> 13:32.178
Star. Where are you going?

13:32.180 --> 13:34.581
- If you won't to talk to him, I will.
- Star!

13:39.521 --> 13:41.755
Just wait, one second.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.731
I've been doing everything I
can to make this happen for us

13:51.733 --> 13:54.401
and you could've done it
with a snap of a finger?

13:54.403 --> 13:56.269
Look, you don't understand
and you need to back off.

13:56.271 --> 13:58.772
- You need to get smart.
- If he was helpful,

13:58.774 --> 14:00.507
do you think we'd be in
Atlanta working out of a salon

14:00.509 --> 14:02.542
- right now?
- I don't know.

14:02.544 --> 14:05.045
'Cause I don't know what
you didn't say to him.

14:05.047 --> 14:06.022
Clearly, he needs to hear it from

14:06.046 --> 14:07.080
- somebody else.
- Hear what?

14:07.082 --> 14:09.115
That he needs to
produce our demo. If he did,

14:09.117 --> 14:11.451
we would get in that contest.
We would get a record deal.

14:11.453 --> 14:13.520
I-I'm so... I don't understand you.

14:13.522 --> 14:14.854
Him?

14:14.856 --> 14:16.756
Help us?

14:16.758 --> 14:18.925
You don't even know how
much that would cost.

14:18.927 --> 14:20.860
I grew up in foster care.

14:20.862 --> 14:22.796
Stop throwing your
sorry-ass foster care story

14:22.798 --> 14:24.931
- in everyone's face.
- It's getting tired.

14:24.933 --> 14:28.027
- Like your dead mom?
- We all have things to deal with, okay?

14:28.052 --> 14:29.369
You had to make yours up.

14:29.371 --> 14:31.071
You want to lie to me about who you are

14:31.073 --> 14:33.340
- and then flip the script?
- Go ahead.

14:33.342 --> 14:34.808
Figure it out for yourself.

14:34.810 --> 14:36.209
As usual.

14:36.211 --> 14:38.782
I'm gonna go work on
this song with Simone.

14:38.807 --> 14:39.679
Okay.

14:39.681 --> 14:42.503
You're a fake ass bitch.
She's a fake ass bitch.

14:45.454 --> 14:48.088
And I thought that I was a stunt queen.

14:49.992 --> 14:52.459
She a fraud.

14:52.461 --> 14:54.024
Her father Roland Crane.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.066
- I can explain.
- I opened up to you

15:00.068 --> 15:02.302
like I never did with nobody else.

15:03.338 --> 15:05.405
Why would you front like that?

15:05.407 --> 15:08.008
You know what you are?

15:09.277 --> 15:11.177
A liar.

15:12.881 --> 15:15.015
Derek...

15:20.555 --> 15:22.822
Look, I'm telling you right now,

15:22.824 --> 15:24.357
those girls, they ain't no fluke.

15:24.359 --> 15:26.860
I mean, they did all of
that on short notice.

15:26.862 --> 15:28.228
I mean, can you imagine?

15:28.230 --> 15:29.496
Can you imagine what they could do with

15:29.498 --> 15:31.197
a little bit of money behind them?

15:31.199 --> 15:33.366
Look, all I need is $30,000

15:33.368 --> 15:36.636
for this demo. Hunter, you told
me you wanted to build outside

15:36.638 --> 15:38.705
the NFL anyway, here's your shot, holmes.

15:38.707 --> 15:40.140
They were good.

15:40.142 --> 15:41.341
But music is just like

15:41.343 --> 15:43.443
the restaurants I invest in.

15:43.445 --> 15:44.944
- _
- Two weeks after they're open,

15:44.946 --> 15:46.579
I want to kill myself.

15:46.581 --> 15:48.114
Or you take the risk, Arlene.

15:48.116 --> 15:49.683
I mean, 'cause what?
For every 100 groups,

15:49.685 --> 15:51.885
you might just find a TLC
or a Destiny's Child, right?

15:51.887 --> 15:54.187
Yeah, well, the girls aren't the risk, Unc.

15:54.189 --> 15:56.523
Every time we give you money,
it goes right up your nose.

15:56.525 --> 15:59.038
What? Why you always
on with that, Arlene?

15:59.063 --> 16:00.960
I'm clean and you know it.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.662
Look, I think you're missing out here.

16:02.664 --> 16:04.364
These girls are special.
I'm telling you right now.

16:04.366 --> 16:07.000
- They're special.
- Well, if they're so special

16:07.002 --> 16:08.974
then I'm sure you're gonna have
no trouble getting the money.

16:15.744 --> 16:19.279
Bet on that.

16:19.281 --> 16:22.048
You know, he could
be right about this one.

16:22.050 --> 16:23.316
True.

16:23.318 --> 16:27.454
A white girl who could sing R&B.

16:27.456 --> 16:30.623
Even the mediocre ones go platinum.

16:37.499 --> 16:39.299
Watch out for this girl.

16:39.301 --> 16:41.568
See if she's really worth it.

16:46.174 --> 16:49.476
C, what you doing?

16:51.012 --> 16:53.947
I had a talk with Jahil.

16:53.949 --> 16:55.548
Trifling Mexican.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.350
- He from Peru.
- Whatever.

16:57.352 --> 16:59.719
What y'all talk about, the girls?

16:59.721 --> 17:01.821
Yeah.

17:01.823 --> 17:05.358
He reminded me I lost the
girls after Mary died.

17:07.229 --> 17:09.963
I wanted those girls so bad,

17:09.964 --> 17:11.431
but...

17:11.433 --> 17:13.398
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

17:15.737 --> 17:17.537
You got to give that to God.

17:17.539 --> 17:19.873
That's what you know how to do.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.207
You taught me that.

17:21.209 --> 17:23.209
You got to give it to God.

17:23.211 --> 17:24.778
Yeah, well, if they keep
working with Jahil,

17:24.780 --> 17:26.045
they're gonna get hurt.

17:26.047 --> 17:27.380
They ain't gonna get hurt.

17:27.382 --> 17:30.049
They got you, flaws and all.

17:30.051 --> 17:33.119
But I do know you got to
tell them girls the truth.

17:33.121 --> 17:34.320
You got to tell them

17:34.322 --> 17:36.589
about you and Mary. Y'all past.

17:36.591 --> 17:39.425
That's them girls' mama and
I think you owe that to them.

17:41.563 --> 17:43.096
Star ain't exactly the listening type.

17:43.098 --> 17:44.831
I don't care if Star's listening or not.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.399
You got to be honest.

17:46.401 --> 17:48.168
You need to tell them about Jahil,

17:48.170 --> 17:49.469
what he did to y'all,

17:49.471 --> 17:51.471
whyou don't like him.

17:51.473 --> 17:53.406
Ain't about Star.

17:53.408 --> 17:55.942
It's about you being
honest with yourself.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.079
That's the only way you
gonna get through all this.

17:58.104 --> 18:00.146
And I know them girls,
they're gonna be a handful.

18:00.148 --> 18:01.381
I don't like none of them.

18:01.383 --> 18:04.818
Real talk.

18:04.820 --> 18:07.954
I'm gonna get you a zanny bar.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.390
Calm you all the way down.

18:10.392 --> 18:11.724
Bring you all the way together.

18:11.726 --> 18:14.661
Girl, I ain't
messing with that mess.

18:14.663 --> 18:16.462
There's enough high people in this house.

18:16.464 --> 18:18.097
It worked for me.

18:18.099 --> 18:19.766
I finna go get me one, baby, I need one,

18:19.768 --> 18:21.801
especially after Roland
Crane pumped through here.

18:21.803 --> 18:22.976
Can you believe that?

18:23.001 --> 18:24.334
Bitch, I about threw up.

18:24.673 --> 18:26.439
Bitch, I gagged.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.480
I need you to come home.

18:34.482 --> 18:35.815
You're the only one

18:35.817 --> 18:37.250
that can handle that woman.

18:37.252 --> 18:39.152
I can't take care her anymore, Dad.

18:39.154 --> 18:41.454
It's getting worse.

18:41.456 --> 18:44.090
And you know I don't help things.

18:44.092 --> 18:45.558
She needs you.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.527
I just want to focus on my music.

18:47.529 --> 18:49.963
I caught some of it on SoundCloud.

18:49.965 --> 18:51.865
You know that one song, the one...

18:51.867 --> 18:54.267
you know, the one about waves?

18:54.269 --> 18:57.337
I think if you just work on
the lyric a little bit and...

18:57.339 --> 19:00.540
bring in the chorus a
little earlier, it's dope.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.775
You really think so?

19:02.777 --> 19:05.478
I mean, what about Star and Simone?

19:05.480 --> 19:08.581
You don't need that trash.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.216
Trash?

19:10.218 --> 19:13.019
They add a whole new
dimension to the sound.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.221
Come home.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.589
Help your mother,

19:16.591 --> 19:18.725
and let me help you.

19:22.406 --> 19:24.906
I'll think about it.

19:41.112 --> 19:43.497
Alexandra's about to leave Atlanta.

19:43.499 --> 19:45.029
What are you talking about?
What happened?

19:45.053 --> 19:47.101
Her parents waltzed into the salon today

19:47.103 --> 19:48.936
and they're trying to convince
her to go back to New York.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.271
Wait a minute.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.872
I thought she said her mother was dead.

19:51.874 --> 19:53.707
She's very much alive.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.009
And a bitch.

19:55.011 --> 19:57.711
And wait for it, her father

19:57.713 --> 19:59.346
is Roland Crane.

19:59.348 --> 20:00.881
What? Roland Crane?

20:00.883 --> 20:02.283
Roland Crane.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.685
Roland Crane, the
rock star, Roland Crane?

20:04.687 --> 20:07.021
That one.

20:08.257 --> 20:09.666
And he says he wants to produce

20:09.691 --> 20:11.926
her solo record.

20:11.928 --> 20:13.394
We got to do something, man,

20:13.396 --> 20:14.995
or she's gonna go.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.931
Ah, you know what? Forget about her.

20:16.933 --> 20:19.567
Listen to me.

20:19.569 --> 20:22.136
You're the only one I care about anyway.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.572
I tell you what, you drop those
other two, and you and me,

20:24.574 --> 20:25.940
we get your solo record off the ground.

20:25.942 --> 20:28.275
I'm not dropping my sister.

20:28.277 --> 20:30.177
I told you, we're a package deal.

20:30.179 --> 20:32.480
I don't believe that.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.381
And you don't believe that either.

20:34.383 --> 20:36.283
Okay.

20:36.285 --> 20:38.119
All right, Star, hold on a second,

20:38.121 --> 20:39.420
whatever you want, all right?

20:39.422 --> 20:40.621
But we got a deadline.

20:40.623 --> 20:42.389
I'm gonna see if Roland Crane

20:42.391 --> 20:44.425
- is willing to help.
- You don't need all that.

20:44.427 --> 20:45.993
Hey, Star, I got this.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.261
Hey, you don't need to talk to Roland.

20:47.263 --> 20:48.762
Hey, yo!

20:48.764 --> 20:50.898
Star, don't do it.

21:10.319 --> 21:12.987
Yeah, I need to talk to Maggie.

21:15.758 --> 21:18.125
Atlanta is not a good look, darling.

21:18.127 --> 21:20.427
I've seen that Housewives show.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.762
It's trash.

21:21.764 --> 21:24.899
What would you two ladies like to drink?

21:24.901 --> 21:27.434
Sparkling water, please.

21:28.437 --> 21:30.204
Me, too.

21:32.508 --> 21:35.743
Why'd you tell those people I was dead?

21:36.846 --> 21:38.646
I mean, you might as well be.

21:38.648 --> 21:41.649
You promised you'd stop, Mom.

21:41.651 --> 21:44.585
I've left your father again.

21:48.025 --> 21:49.891
How did you meet that girl?

21:49.916 --> 21:51.316
Instagram.

21:51.341 --> 21:53.227
She's a pain in the ass but...

21:53.229 --> 21:54.562
she's talented,

21:54.564 --> 21:56.063
She's positively repulsive.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.332
- That's what she is.
- Good music is made here

21:58.334 --> 22:00.050
by people who get us.

22:00.075 --> 22:02.275
There's good music made everywhere.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.339
Why don't you come back
home with me to London?

22:05.341 --> 22:09.310
Papa can set you up in Abbey Road Studio.

22:10.279 --> 22:12.046
You ever think about,

22:12.048 --> 22:14.315
you know, if you followed your heart?

22:14.317 --> 22:15.849
Modeled?

22:19.055 --> 22:21.956
I'd be a much happier person.

22:25.394 --> 22:27.328
You know, your father is a pig.

22:27.330 --> 22:30.531
He only cares about one
thing and that's himself.

22:30.533 --> 22:32.833
But he does love you, Alexandra.

22:34.413 --> 22:36.337
And I'm trying to stop.

22:36.339 --> 22:38.939
Really. I am.

22:40.977 --> 22:42.209
Come back.

22:42.211 --> 22:45.479
Please.

22:53.856 --> 22:55.623
And you are?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.424
Star.

22:57.426 --> 22:59.526
Sure you don't have any black in you,

22:59.528 --> 23:01.395
Star?

23:01.397 --> 23:03.764
Your mama put a big burden on you, huh?

23:03.766 --> 23:06.734
I can handle it.

23:06.736 --> 23:08.269
All right.

23:08.271 --> 23:09.503
What are... what are you doing here?

23:09.505 --> 23:11.639
All Alex wants is a career in music.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.941
You can give that to her,
so why won't you?

23:13.943 --> 23:15.809
Because I don't want
her in this business.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.444
You're in it.

23:17.446 --> 23:18.678
And she's not me.

23:18.703 --> 23:20.136
I'm sure.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.217
But Alex said you didn't like her music

23:23.219 --> 23:25.886
and that's the part that
confuses me because she's fire.

23:25.888 --> 23:27.755
We're fire.

23:27.757 --> 23:29.390
You know,

23:29.392 --> 23:32.760
you could just produce our demo.

23:35.765 --> 23:38.365
Everyone wants to be a star,

23:38.367 --> 23:39.933
Star.

23:43.572 --> 23:46.640
People are starting to notice us.

23:55.051 --> 23:56.517
Us?

23:56.519 --> 24:00.087
We should probably get out of this lobby.

24:59.118 --> 25:02.352
You remember me telling you about my group?

25:04.557 --> 25:07.991
Why you keep acting
like y'all was nobodies?

25:09.528 --> 25:11.261
Mixed Harmony.

25:11.263 --> 25:15.132
You know, that song you made

25:15.134 --> 25:19.303
was responsible for a
lot of babies being born.

25:20.139 --> 25:22.439
Including one of mine.

25:25.644 --> 25:29.313
We ended up in a bad way.

25:31.317 --> 25:33.784
Yeah.

25:33.786 --> 25:36.787
But that road eventually led to God.

25:36.789 --> 25:41.158
I just don't want those girls to
go through what I went through.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.361
So, how can I help?

25:44.363 --> 25:46.630
What can I do?

25:47.933 --> 25:51.235
You're always there for me and my kids.

25:51.237 --> 25:54.805
It's the least I can do with
everything you helped me with.

25:55.941 --> 25:57.941
That's why I love you.

25:59.245 --> 26:02.479
Carlotta, you don't just
believe in the church.

26:02.481 --> 26:05.048
You believe in me.

26:07.386 --> 26:10.087
But why you won't let
me more in your world?

26:10.089 --> 26:12.823
Not just here at the church.

26:12.825 --> 26:14.633
At your home.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.493
The salon.

26:16.495 --> 26:18.729
When you gonna invite me to your salon?

26:18.731 --> 26:21.698
You don't want to see that mess.

26:22.509 --> 26:24.134
I got a business to run.

26:24.993 --> 26:27.037
She didn't believe me.
Know what I'm saying?

26:27.039 --> 26:28.538
Well, the reason why I didn't believe you

26:28.540 --> 26:30.340
is because Joseline came to me

26:30.342 --> 26:32.943
in such turmoil and was so
upset and distraught about...

26:51.764 --> 26:53.363
Roland?

26:53.365 --> 26:55.732
I had lunch with Alexandra.

26:56.835 --> 26:58.802
Roland!

26:58.804 --> 27:00.370
Roland!

27:02.241 --> 27:03.407
Roland!

27:12.818 --> 27:15.452
How'd you get a key to my room?

27:16.964 --> 27:19.431
Get her out of here
before I call the police.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.712
For God's sake, she's underage.

27:21.714 --> 27:24.415
You know, those Saint Laurent heels...

27:25.384 --> 27:27.885
...and that cheap vodka,

27:27.887 --> 27:29.820
they don't mix well, baby.

27:31.357 --> 27:34.158
Get out the tub, you slut.

27:36.862 --> 27:39.096
Why would you do that?

27:39.098 --> 27:42.332
That's how I chose to get his attention.

28:23.542 --> 28:25.142
Maggie. How are you, love?

28:29.248 --> 28:31.381
Wipe the seat.

28:35.354 --> 28:36.453
Ah, my queen.

28:36.455 --> 28:37.955
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:37.957 --> 28:39.189
You have what you want.

28:39.191 --> 28:41.725
Look at you. You look so beautiful,

28:41.727 --> 28:43.360
hmm?

28:43.362 --> 28:46.296
- You stayed away a long, long time.
- I know, sweetheart,

28:46.298 --> 28:48.899
and I'm sorry about that,
but you know I love you, right?

28:48.901 --> 28:50.167
Do you?

28:50.169 --> 28:52.636
Or is it just that you need me?

28:57.710 --> 28:59.977
Look, Maggie, here's the thing.

28:59.979 --> 29:02.045
I need money, fast.

29:02.047 --> 29:04.448
Oh, God. Money, money, money,

29:04.450 --> 29:06.316
money.

29:06.318 --> 29:08.685
That's all you want from me is money?

29:08.687 --> 29:11.255
My brother cleaned
out my account in Peru.

29:11.257 --> 29:13.390
Okay, so I need money.
I need... I need a job.

29:13.392 --> 29:15.118
I need something.

29:15.143 --> 29:16.743
- You with a job?
- Can you trust me?

29:16.768 --> 29:19.578
Look in my eyes. Yes, you can trust me.

29:20.566 --> 29:22.766
You better not mess this up.

29:22.768 --> 29:25.669
I'm not gonna mess it up.
It's not a problem, all right?

29:25.671 --> 29:27.137
But here's the thing.

29:27.139 --> 29:29.273
I need the full amount tonight.

29:29.275 --> 29:31.475
Don't play me, Jahil.

29:31.477 --> 29:33.343
You get half tonight

29:33.345 --> 29:36.079
along with instructions.

29:36.081 --> 29:38.081
Now, kiss me.

29:43.789 --> 29:46.323
You call that a kiss?

29:46.325 --> 29:48.592
Kiss me on the lips.

29:55.067 --> 29:56.667
Am I gonna get my money?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.340
Get out of here.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.511
Hmm.

30:07.513 --> 30:10.447
- ♪ They throw my towel down. ♪
- Put that damn thing out.

30:12.323 --> 30:15.057
Why are you waking up in the
middle of the night screaming?

30:18.057 --> 30:19.890
I don't know you that well, Simone,

30:19.892 --> 30:21.525
and you don't remember me,

30:21.527 --> 30:24.528
but your mom was my ace
and I'm here to help.

30:24.530 --> 30:27.130
What have you done?

30:29.668 --> 30:30.968
Where you been?

30:32.972 --> 30:35.272
I had a talk with Alexandra's dad.

30:36.442 --> 30:39.142
You were trying to screw my dad? Really?

30:39.144 --> 30:41.979
Your mother came in before
anything happened, actually.

30:41.981 --> 30:44.114
Bitch, are you really that thirsty?

30:44.116 --> 30:47.184
He said he would talk to us
about producing our demo.

30:47.186 --> 30:49.820
Do you know how many sluts

30:49.822 --> 30:52.322
and groupies he's told
whatever they wanted to hear?

30:52.324 --> 30:54.224
You know, I knew you were ambitious,

30:54.226 --> 30:56.393
but I didn't think you were stupid.

30:56.395 --> 30:57.728
You're an idiot.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.663
Whore. All right. That's enough.

30:59.665 --> 31:01.398
No, Simone, if you're gonna
take her side on this,

31:01.400 --> 31:02.711
you're just as dumb as she is.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.801
- Alexandra, calm down.
- No, no. I'm sick of being

31:04.803 --> 31:06.703
the calm one while she gets
to act like a damn fool.

31:06.705 --> 31:08.538
I was doing what I know how to do.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.474
We brought you here because of your money

31:10.476 --> 31:12.743
and you won't even use it to help.

31:12.745 --> 31:15.445
I came all the way here for you, Star.

31:15.447 --> 31:18.115
And if that isn't wanting to help,
I don't know what is.

31:18.117 --> 31:20.617
So, me, my money,

31:20.619 --> 31:22.552
and my songs can leave.

31:23.484 --> 31:25.283
I can't do this.

31:27.259 --> 31:29.693
I'm done.

31:47.648 --> 31:48.914
That a new song?

31:48.916 --> 31:51.083
These are girls I was in contact with

31:51.085 --> 31:52.584
before I met Star.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.920
- I'm out of here.
- Well, I thought y'all were

31:54.922 --> 31:56.388
entering some contest.

31:57.491 --> 31:59.892
Not anymore, I guess.

32:00.828 --> 32:02.828
Look, I am not defending her,

32:02.830 --> 32:06.498
but Star's had it... bad.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.934
We all have.

32:08.936 --> 32:10.969
It's how we get through it that counts.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.481
I don't know where I'd be
without Jesus by my side.

32:25.219 --> 32:28.053
Maybe you should give him a try, Alexandra.

32:35.262 --> 32:38.513
Thank you for being so kind to me.

32:38.515 --> 32:41.850
I really appreciate it,
and I'm sorry that I lied to you

32:41.852 --> 32:44.653
and... everyone.

32:44.655 --> 32:46.288
I didn't think it would get this crazy.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.090
So, where you headed? To New York?

32:48.092 --> 32:50.525
L.A. maybe. I don't know yet.

32:52.229 --> 32:54.463
Hold up, now.
Wait a minute.

32:54.465 --> 32:57.399
Now, you can't just leave
without saying a word.

32:58.058 --> 33:00.192
You slept with my father.

33:00.217 --> 33:01.914
I did not sleep with him.

33:01.939 --> 33:03.238
You were in a bathtub.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.774
You took a bath with the man?

33:05.776 --> 33:08.977
I took a bath by myself.

33:08.979 --> 33:10.946
I never had a bubble bath before.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.848
Let alone at The W.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.920
I was gonna.

33:17.922 --> 33:20.122
But I didn't.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.657
I swear.

33:23.727 --> 33:25.627
You're crazy.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.396
And your crazy outweighs your talent.

33:27.398 --> 33:29.398
I think it's pathetic
that you're gonna give up

33:29.400 --> 33:32.267
because life got just a
little bit too hard for you.

33:32.269 --> 33:33.735
Star,

33:33.737 --> 33:35.137
just let her go.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.238
We'll be fine.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.741
All right.

33:39.743 --> 33:41.448
Can you take me to my parents?

33:43.247 --> 33:45.948
Let me get my keys.

33:47.618 --> 33:50.118
Ugh.

33:51.789 --> 33:56.425
I'd given up questioning
your taste a long time ago.

33:56.427 --> 33:58.489
And now you resorted to children!

34:00.130 --> 34:01.730
I'm telling you, she's a con.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.066
Shh. Honey, she's coming
now and she's bringing

34:04.068 --> 34:06.368
that damn hairdresser with her.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.853
Before you say anything,
your friend came on to me, all right?

34:13.210 --> 34:16.277
That girl will eventually

34:16.280 --> 34:19.081
get you to do things
you are not proud of.

34:19.083 --> 34:23.652
We're a good group and
you'll know that someday.

34:23.654 --> 34:24.920
So, in case you haven't

34:24.922 --> 34:27.656
figured it out...

34:27.658 --> 34:29.597
I'm not coming home.

34:29.621 --> 34:31.326
But I wanted to make it real clear

34:31.328 --> 34:32.860
that you don't own me anymore.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.963
And I won't put up with any more of your

34:34.965 --> 34:37.032
manipulations, either.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.074
So, here.

34:40.637 --> 34:43.304
You haven't even begun to
understand what you're doing.

34:43.306 --> 34:45.540
Roland!

34:45.542 --> 34:46.842
Apologize.

34:46.844 --> 34:48.377
Apologize?

34:48.379 --> 34:49.643
Apologize for what?

34:49.646 --> 34:50.879
What?

34:50.880 --> 34:52.147
For the-for the schools,

34:52.149 --> 34:55.384
and the-and the vacations?

34:55.386 --> 34:57.219
And the life I never had?

34:57.221 --> 34:58.888
Pfft, please.

35:01.754 --> 35:05.423
Alexandra, this isn't necessary.

35:07.431 --> 35:11.099
Mom, you need help.

35:11.101 --> 35:14.736
But I don't think I can be
the one to help you anymore.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.274
Can you talk to her?

35:19.276 --> 35:20.409
Please?

35:20.411 --> 35:23.545
Well, it seems she made up her mind.

35:23.547 --> 35:26.381
You know, it's ironic.

35:26.383 --> 35:30.118
You give your kids
this-this-this magical,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.620
privileged life

35:31.622 --> 35:33.789
so they don't have to
know how black they are...

35:33.791 --> 35:35.223
You know, you?

35:35.225 --> 35:37.492
You're a piece of work.

35:37.494 --> 35:39.828
I had my doubts about that girl,

35:39.830 --> 35:42.030
but after you two?

35:42.032 --> 35:45.634
She's better off with us.

35:45.636 --> 35:47.558
And you need to stop chasing kids

35:47.583 --> 35:49.438
and actually work on your music.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.908
Which sucks, by the way.

35:52.910 --> 35:55.577
That's all right.

35:55.579 --> 35:58.246
When she sees how tough
this life is, she'll be back.

35:58.248 --> 36:00.816
Filth.

36:03.487 --> 36:06.054
What are you doing here?

36:06.056 --> 36:08.390
I was in the neighborhood.

36:11.595 --> 36:13.361
Star told me you'd be here.

36:14.665 --> 36:16.665
What, is she sleeping with you, too, now?

36:20.174 --> 36:22.308
I'm sorry.

36:23.874 --> 36:27.642
The girls told me you might be leaving.

36:27.644 --> 36:31.913
Don't leave me.

36:55.489 --> 36:57.589
Simone.

37:35.496 --> 37:37.262
Simone, where you at?

37:37.264 --> 37:39.198
Are you getting ready
to go to church with me?

37:39.200 --> 37:41.567
Uh, I'll meet you in
the car, Miss Carlotta.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.035
I'm ready.

37:51.112 --> 37:53.449
Phew. Don't go in there.

37:53.474 --> 37:56.475
Oh, God.

37:57.382 --> 37:59.582
Okay, you can't smell it from here.

37:59.584 --> 38:01.384
- Ugh.
- Hi.

38:01.386 --> 38:04.653
I signed us up for the contest.

38:04.655 --> 38:06.889
Jahil just needs to get us in the studio.

38:06.891 --> 38:08.457
So you're back?

38:09.827 --> 38:11.560
Okay, look,

38:11.562 --> 38:13.529
this is the last thing
I'm gonna say about it,

38:13.531 --> 38:14.897
but when I went to your dad,

38:14.899 --> 38:17.066
I was really thinking about all of us.

38:17.068 --> 38:19.568
I wasn't even thinking
about him being your dad.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.537
I was just doing what I always do.

38:21.539 --> 38:24.673
Which always works, by the way.

38:24.675 --> 38:26.876
I did not sleep with him.

38:26.878 --> 38:29.979
But I am a whore.

38:32.850 --> 38:34.594
A thirsty whore.

38:34.619 --> 38:36.552
Yes.

38:36.554 --> 38:39.321
Very much so.

38:39.323 --> 38:40.689
When do you want to work on this?

38:40.691 --> 38:42.525
When you're done with it.

38:42.527 --> 38:43.793
It's finished.

38:43.795 --> 38:45.428
Let's get Simone and rehearse.

38:45.430 --> 38:47.563
She went to church with Miss Carlotta.

38:47.565 --> 38:49.131
Of course she did.

38:49.133 --> 38:51.367
That's all right. I'll queue it up

38:51.369 --> 38:53.235
and we'll rehearse with
her when she gets here.

38:53.237 --> 38:56.205
Hey, hey, y'all.

38:56.207 --> 38:58.074
I'm enrolling you in school.

38:58.076 --> 38:59.675
You're living with me,
you're going to school.

38:59.677 --> 39:01.544
Can't just be going to Bible study.

39:01.546 --> 39:04.046
Look what the wind then blew in.

39:05.683 --> 39:08.150
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

39:08.152 --> 39:09.952
Simone,

39:09.954 --> 39:11.854
when you gonna sing for us?

39:11.856 --> 39:14.457
I done gave up trying to convince her.

39:14.459 --> 39:17.426
I just don't know any gospel songs.

39:17.428 --> 39:18.961
You said you can sing.

39:18.963 --> 39:20.229
Okay.

39:20.231 --> 39:22.531
Well, sing. If you let the Lord use you,

39:22.533 --> 39:24.600
he'll bless you every time.

39:24.602 --> 39:26.702
You know what?

39:26.704 --> 39:27.970
Help her out.

39:29.407 --> 39:31.740
Y'all gonna pull it together.

39:31.742 --> 39:33.442
Thou shall not judge.

39:33.444 --> 39:35.111
We ain't judging.

39:35.113 --> 39:36.745
He bye, bye, bye see you.

39:36.747 --> 39:38.121
Do it, Lord.

39:38.146 --> 39:40.660
I saw a cowboy hat in here.

39:40.685 --> 39:43.452
Oh, my God, dude, this says Arnold.

39:43.454 --> 39:45.654
Do you think that's Cotton's real name?

39:45.656 --> 39:48.624
