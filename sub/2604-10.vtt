WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.387
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:01.414 --> 00:03.404
You looked me in the eye,
and told me that your hood

00:03.504 --> 00:04.769
was rock solid?

00:04.771 --> 00:06.738
You make it right on your own,
or I will.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.807
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.542
We pass.
You think I don't know

00:10.544 --> 00:11.810
this was your doing?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.345
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.980
What did Hardman
find in those files?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.515
I don't know,
and I don't care.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.317
I'm entitled to name one
new senior partner a year.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.752
I'm naming you.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.853
You think he's valuing you.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.021
He's buying you.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.923
Hardman actually <i>sees</i> me!

00:24.925 --> 00:26.691
You kept me waiting five years.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.693
You can wait another 24 hours.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.396
It's your grandma.
She passed away.

00:31.398 --> 00:32.564
No.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.766
Either Jessica
will retain her position,

00:34.768 --> 00:38.503
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.199
Well...

00:41.201 --> 00:43.968
in a few minutes, we'll know.

00:43.970 --> 00:46.398
Last time we spoke,
there was a lot of talk about

00:46.399 --> 00:48.007
peeling each other
off the walls.

00:48.090 --> 00:48.678
I just want to say--

00:48.896 --> 00:51.931
Stop talking.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.867
As you wish.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:18.659 --> 01:19.858
What are you doing here?

01:19.860 --> 01:21.393
Rachel, meet the file room.

01:21.395 --> 01:23.495
It's where we store information

01:23.497 --> 01:24.563
on the cases
that we're working on.

01:24.565 --> 01:26.932
No, I-I just mean,

01:26.934 --> 01:29.735
I don't believe that Harvey
would make you come and work

01:29.737 --> 01:33.405
the day after...

01:33.407 --> 01:36.575
You can say it.

01:37.812 --> 01:39.945
Okay, I'll say it.

01:39.947 --> 01:41.747
The day after
my grandmother died.

01:41.749 --> 01:43.215
And Harvey doesn't know.

01:43.217 --> 01:44.750
What? Why?

01:44.752 --> 01:46.251
'Cause,
there's a vote going on,

01:46.253 --> 01:47.886
and he's got bigger things
on his mind.

01:47.888 --> 01:50.255
- Mike, he'd want to know.
- Oh, really, you know that?

01:50.257 --> 01:52.324
You and--you and Harvey
are best friends now?

01:52.326 --> 01:54.793
Okay, then tell Donna.
Just tell somebody that--

01:54.795 --> 01:56.261
I don't want people to know.

01:56.263 --> 01:58.630
If you tell people,
they will understand,

01:58.632 --> 02:01.100
and then you can go home,
and you can really deal with--

02:01.102 --> 02:04.903
Deal with what, Rachel?

02:04.905 --> 02:06.271
The fact that I missed
my last-ever chance

02:06.273 --> 02:08.273
to see my grandmother
because I was too busy at work?

02:08.275 --> 02:09.741
Oh, come on,
that's not fair.

02:09.744 --> 02:11.276
You were an amazing grandson.

02:11.278 --> 02:12.644
You--you were buying
her an apartment--

02:12.646 --> 02:14.480
I bought her an apartment
because I felt guilty

02:14.482 --> 02:16.015
for not having seen her
for two months.

02:16.017 --> 02:17.549
No, you were buying
her an apartment because--

02:17.551 --> 02:19.651
This is not a debate, Rachel.

02:19.653 --> 02:22.254
All right, I came to work
because I want to work.

02:22.256 --> 02:24.456
I'm not telling people because
I don't want to talk about it.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.525
And now I'm gonna go out
and get some fresh air,

02:26.527 --> 02:27.793
and when I get back,

02:27.795 --> 02:31.096
I really hope
you will be done bothering me.

02:42.108 --> 02:43.675
The managing partner...

02:43.677 --> 02:44.810
is Daniel Hardman.

02:44.812 --> 02:47.079
Effective immediately.

02:50.985 --> 02:52.217
I want to thank you for

02:52.219 --> 02:53.452
trusting me with
the future of this firm.

02:53.454 --> 02:55.788
I won't let you down.

02:55.790 --> 02:57.956
Let's get back to work.

02:57.958 --> 02:58.957
Harvey...

02:58.959 --> 03:01.060
a word.

03:01.062 --> 03:04.063
I know that we have
a rocky history,

03:04.065 --> 03:06.465
but I would be
a fool not to recognize

03:06.467 --> 03:08.467
your value to this firm.
Daniel, you won.

03:08.469 --> 03:10.402
You don't need
to blow smoke up my ass.

03:10.404 --> 03:12.237
I'm not blowing smoke.

03:12.239 --> 03:13.839
I told you this
from the day I came back,

03:13.841 --> 03:16.208
that I was us to find
a way to work together.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.077
Why say this to me
and not Jessica?

03:18.079 --> 03:19.578
I will.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.180
But her name is on the door.

03:21.182 --> 03:22.681
She's not going anywhere.

03:22.683 --> 03:27.586
I want to make sure that you're
not going anywhere either.

03:27.588 --> 03:29.421
It's time to go.

03:29.423 --> 03:31.623
I can name 12 partners
who will follow you anywhere.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.093
We can have every associate
in the place.

03:34.095 --> 03:35.527
Harvey...

03:35.529 --> 03:37.229
we're not going anywhere.

03:37.231 --> 03:39.264
We have a non-compete clause.

03:39.266 --> 03:42.701
We quit, we can't practice law
in New York for a year.

03:42.703 --> 03:44.002
Contracts
were made to be broken.

03:44.004 --> 03:46.171
Not when
they're written by me.

03:46.173 --> 03:48.440
Well, maybe we should take
a year off.

03:48.442 --> 03:50.109
- How would that go?
- You could teach.

03:50.111 --> 03:52.377
- I could also kill myself.
- You could write a book.

03:52.379 --> 03:54.012
- Next.
- What about travel?

03:54.014 --> 03:55.380
You have the means.

03:55.382 --> 03:56.515
See the world.

03:56.517 --> 03:58.317
Teaching, writing, traveling.

03:58.319 --> 04:00.085
You know what
you're talking about?

04:00.087 --> 04:01.120
Running.

04:01.122 --> 04:02.354
I'm not running.

04:02.356 --> 04:05.190
We can't stay here.
Not working for him.

04:05.192 --> 04:06.625
Yes, we can.

04:06.627 --> 04:08.327
We are going
to swallow our pride,

04:08.329 --> 04:09.661
and we're going to wait

04:09.663 --> 04:12.297
until we can make a move
from a position of strength.

04:12.299 --> 04:13.732
That's your tactic?

04:13.734 --> 04:15.567
Holding your head down
and waiting?

04:15.569 --> 04:16.935
That's what he did.

04:16.937 --> 04:18.670
It took him five years.
Do you really think it's gonna

04:18.672 --> 04:21.072
take him five years
to screw up again?

04:21.075 --> 04:22.941
I bet it'll be more
like five minutes.

04:22.943 --> 04:25.410
- Jessica--
- That's enough.

04:25.412 --> 04:27.846
This happened today.
Today.

04:27.848 --> 04:30.048
We just took the hit.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.450
We suffered a loss,

04:31.452 --> 04:33.685
and you don't make
major life decisions

04:33.687 --> 04:36.321
when you're reeling
from a loss.

04:42.929 --> 04:45.831
I wanna buy some weed.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.535
Sorry, man, you got
it wrong, but, uh,

04:49.537 --> 04:50.569
hey, if you want a paper,
I'll be--

04:50.571 --> 04:52.804
I'm not a cop, okay?

04:52.806 --> 04:54.006
I know for a fact
that you're a dealer.

04:54.008 --> 04:55.307
I've seen you here
every single day.

04:55.309 --> 04:56.875
I know the drill.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.477
A guy comes up,
he hands you a $100 bill,

04:58.479 --> 05:00.546
he walks away with a folded
newspaper full of weed.

05:00.548 --> 05:01.847
Well, I have money.

05:01.849 --> 05:03.382
If you don't want it,
I'll be happy to take it

05:03.384 --> 05:05.250
to the coffee cart
down at 50th and Lex

05:05.252 --> 05:09.021
who we both know
is your competition.

05:13.426 --> 05:14.626
Have a great day.

05:50.936 --> 05:52.573
Don't you dare touch
his balls.

05:54.707 --> 05:56.073
What the hell?

05:56.075 --> 05:58.275
These bozos walked in here
right after the vote.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.911
We're moving to the 46th floor.

06:00.913 --> 06:02.713
You and Paul Porter
are switching.

06:02.715 --> 06:05.683
Hardman.

06:05.685 --> 06:07.184
Bowties have no place here!

06:07.186 --> 06:09.320
All that bullshit
about working together?

06:09.322 --> 06:10.387
You forgot to mention

06:10.389 --> 06:12.523
that it was down
on the 46th floor.

06:12.525 --> 06:13.891
It's just four walls, Harvey.

06:13.893 --> 06:15.192
Yeah, so is a prison cell,

06:15.194 --> 06:16.827
which is where you send people
to be punished.

06:16.829 --> 06:19.129
Paul Porter was loyal to me

06:19.131 --> 06:20.998
long before
we were Pearson Hardman.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.733
I reward people
who are loyal to me.

06:22.735 --> 06:24.902
Show me you are
one of those people.

06:24.904 --> 06:27.071
It's one thing
to become king of the hill.

06:27.073 --> 06:28.372
It's another to stay there.

06:28.374 --> 06:30.307
Accept this with grace,
Harvey.

06:30.309 --> 06:31.575
You want grace?

06:31.577 --> 06:33.911
I'll give you the courtesy
you never gave me.

06:33.913 --> 06:35.579
I'll say it to your face.

06:35.581 --> 06:38.549
I'm coming for you.

06:44.556 --> 06:47.057
What were you doing in there?
Kissing the ring?

06:47.059 --> 06:49.727
Don't try to weasel your way in
with another managing partner.

06:49.729 --> 06:53.964
That job's already taken.

06:55.734 --> 06:57.668
Daniel.
You wanted to see me.

06:59.404 --> 07:01.772
Don't mind if I do.

07:01.774 --> 07:04.775
Louis, this firm has been
through a divisive fight.

07:04.777 --> 07:05.976
Of which you were victorious.

07:05.978 --> 07:08.812
We were victorious.
Unfortunately,

07:08.814 --> 07:11.248
it's not a victory unless
we're united moving forward.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.450
- That is so true.
- Jessica's a class act.

07:13.452 --> 07:15.286
She'll take the defeat
in stride.

07:15.288 --> 07:16.420
She's not the problem.

07:16.422 --> 07:18.856
What do you need?

07:18.858 --> 07:22.526
You made me senior partner.
I always pay my debts.

07:22.528 --> 07:23.627
I'm a Lannister.

07:23.629 --> 07:24.695
The problem is her pitbull.

07:24.697 --> 07:26.530
Well,
Harvey can be polarizing.

07:26.532 --> 07:29.199
But I can't just fire him.
He's a senior partner.

07:29.201 --> 07:31.735
Uh, I'm sorry, fire him?

07:31.737 --> 07:33.871
Do you have
a problem with that?

07:33.873 --> 07:36.674
Louis, he just came in here
and announced he's putting

07:36.676 --> 07:38.676
a target on my back.
You voted for me.

07:38.678 --> 07:43.013
That means there's
a target on your back too.

07:43.015 --> 07:46.216
Tell me what to do.

07:54.626 --> 07:55.859
Oh!

07:55.861 --> 07:56.961
You have
to stop doing that.

07:56.963 --> 07:58.329
Well, you weren't
at your desk,

07:58.331 --> 08:00.731
so I figured you and your small
bladder would be here.

08:00.733 --> 08:03.567
These cases,
they're a priority.

08:03.569 --> 08:04.735
- Fine.
- Do you know what that means?

08:04.737 --> 08:05.836
Yes, I know what
the word priority means.

08:05.838 --> 08:07.137
Well, you're gonna
get them done

08:07.139 --> 08:08.639
before you even consider
doing anything for Harvey.

08:08.641 --> 08:10.908
You don't get him a file,
you don't bring him a coffee,

08:10.910 --> 08:12.242
you don't buy him his hair gel--

08:12.244 --> 08:13.444
That's not what I do for him.

08:13.446 --> 08:15.646
Right, like he buys
his own hair gel.

08:15.648 --> 08:16.747
Doesn't matter.

08:16.749 --> 08:17.815
You don't do anything
for him now.

08:17.817 --> 08:19.249
You're just like everyone else.

08:19.251 --> 08:22.353
You belong to me.

08:22.355 --> 08:25.489
- I don't belong to anyone.
- Well, then quit.

08:25.491 --> 08:27.124
Your days are numbered
here anyway.

08:27.126 --> 08:29.493
You don't get this shit done,
I'm gonna fire you myself.

08:29.495 --> 08:31.528
Tch.

08:37.836 --> 08:39.135
It's either me or the movers,

08:39.138 --> 08:40.604
and at least I know
where my hands have been.

08:44.910 --> 08:45.976
I need more packing tape.

08:45.978 --> 08:47.177
Oh, it's right over there.

08:47.179 --> 08:49.813
I know.

08:49.815 --> 08:52.049
Wow, there's
a first for everything.

08:52.051 --> 08:53.384
The mighty Donna,
nothing to say.

08:53.386 --> 08:54.551
Trouble in paradise?

08:54.553 --> 08:58.822
- Louis, get out.
- I'm not afraid of you.

08:58.824 --> 09:00.290
Okay, listen...

09:00.292 --> 09:03.093
I've, uh, been asked
to redistribute the workload.

09:03.095 --> 09:05.095
Jessica focused too much
on the flash.

09:05.097 --> 09:06.463
These cases won't make
<i>The New York Times,</i>

09:06.465 --> 09:09.867
but they'll definitely bankroll
our bonuses.

09:09.869 --> 09:11.568
It's an employee retirement
income security act case.

09:11.570 --> 09:14.171
You know what that means?
I know what ERISA is, Louis.

09:14.173 --> 09:15.439
Oh, good, so you won't mind
the detail-oriented nature

09:15.441 --> 09:17.474
of the assignment.
I won't mind it at all.

09:17.476 --> 09:19.576
Great.
By the way, Harvey,

09:19.578 --> 09:22.012
if you're planning
on pawning this off to Mike,

09:22.014 --> 09:24.014
well, you can't.

09:24.016 --> 09:27.785
Mike's focus has been too, um...
Harvey-centric.

09:27.787 --> 09:29.453
So I assigned
our resident wunderkind

09:29.455 --> 09:30.654
some cases of his own.

09:30.656 --> 09:34.625
Auf wiedersehen.

09:37.562 --> 09:39.897
You look overwhelmed.
Let me help.

09:39.899 --> 09:41.665
Forget that.
You're gonna do this instead.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.834
Louis said I'm not allowed
to prioritize your work anymore.

09:43.836 --> 09:46.236
You think I'm taking orders
from Louis now?

09:46.238 --> 09:47.871
Consider things status quo.

09:47.873 --> 09:49.673
Yeah, well, they aren't.

09:49.675 --> 09:51.575
They are as far as
you and I are concerned.

09:51.577 --> 09:53.343
I give you work,
and you're gonna do it.

09:53.345 --> 09:55.479
Oh, right, I forgot.

09:55.481 --> 09:57.347
That's how it works with us.

09:57.349 --> 09:59.216
Don't pout.
You're gonna love this case.

09:59.218 --> 10:01.685
It's very detail-oriented.
And what are you doing?

10:01.687 --> 10:03.087
Operation "Right the ship."

10:03.089 --> 10:04.655
Maybe it's time

10:04.657 --> 10:06.323
that you just accept
that it's over.

10:06.325 --> 10:08.325
You lost. Deal with it.

10:08.327 --> 10:09.326
Excuse me?

10:11.897 --> 10:13.564
You seem to live
in this deluded world

10:13.566 --> 10:15.799
where you think
that you can always win.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.268
But sometimes you can't.

10:18.270 --> 10:20.170
Bad things happen.
You have to face

10:20.172 --> 10:21.705
the fact that life is gonna be

10:21.707 --> 10:24.074
this case or this case
or this case!

10:24.076 --> 10:26.343
Jessica lost!
You lost!

10:26.345 --> 10:27.811
And there isn't anything
that any of us,

10:27.813 --> 10:32.182
including the great and powerful
Harvey Specter, can do about it.

10:32.184 --> 10:34.218
Go home.

10:34.220 --> 10:36.220
Now.

10:53.739 --> 11:01.745
♪

11:22.409 --> 11:26.112
Oh.

11:31.593 --> 11:32.726
Ugh.

11:33.862 --> 11:35.362
Uh.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.832
Yeah?

11:38.834 --> 11:40.600
Okay, you're clearly
not ready to go.

11:40.602 --> 11:43.970
What? Come on, the funeral
doesn't start for another--

11:43.972 --> 11:45.372
oh, shit!
- It's okay.

11:45.374 --> 11:47.674
It's okay.
Uh, can I wear this?

11:47.676 --> 11:49.209
- Here, drink this.
- Okay.

11:49.211 --> 11:50.343
You're gonna get in the
shower, and I'm gonna find you

11:50.345 --> 11:52.746
something to wear, okay?
Mmhmm. Okay.

11:52.748 --> 11:54.547
Oh.

11:54.549 --> 11:58.118
- Mike?
- Yeah?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.419
Is this a great idea?

11:59.421 --> 12:01.254
Rachel, it's one night, okay?

12:01.256 --> 12:02.622
Please, take it easy on me.

12:02.624 --> 12:06.292
It looks like
more than one night.

12:09.297 --> 12:11.464
You're right.

12:19.975 --> 12:21.474
Thanks, Rachel.
I'll be out in five, okay?

12:21.476 --> 12:22.876
Okay.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.726
Donna.

12:42.330 --> 12:43.830
Donna.

12:43.832 --> 12:46.566
Donna!

12:50.204 --> 12:51.604
I'm sorry,
but apparently Paul Porter

12:51.606 --> 12:52.906
doesn't believe in technology.

12:52.908 --> 12:54.507
Look, I need
the employment survey.

12:54.509 --> 12:55.775
Yeah, I'm working on it.

12:55.777 --> 12:57.076
It's not done?

12:57.078 --> 12:58.578
It's a survey
of all 50 states.

12:58.580 --> 12:59.679
You gotta get on this.

12:59.681 --> 13:00.947
Mike could have done it
in his sleep.

13:00.949 --> 13:02.148
I'm sorry I don't have
a photographic memory,

13:02.150 --> 13:04.984
but my brain is already
too busy being awesome.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.219
Well, what about one
of the other associates?

13:06.221 --> 13:07.320
Which one?

13:07.322 --> 13:08.788
- You know.
- Do I?

13:08.790 --> 13:10.323
- The blonde one.
- Oh, of course.

13:10.325 --> 13:12.592
- Then the brunette.
- Male? Female?

13:12.594 --> 13:14.027
Yes.

13:14.029 --> 13:16.529
You don't know a single
one of their names, do you?

13:16.531 --> 13:18.832
- Mike Ross.
- Ha-ha.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.667
Do I need to remind you
that you're the one

13:20.669 --> 13:23.136
who sent him home yesterday?

13:23.138 --> 13:24.437
I thought he would come back.

13:24.439 --> 13:28.141
You know,
you could call him, Harvey.

13:28.143 --> 13:30.777
Just get me anyone.

13:30.779 --> 13:31.978
What?

13:31.980 --> 13:33.913
No one's available.

13:33.915 --> 13:39.686
- Why not?
- No one's available...to you.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.154
Louis.

13:41.156 --> 13:42.288
He's trying to bait me.

13:42.290 --> 13:43.823
What are you gonna
do about it?

13:43.825 --> 13:46.192
Nothing.

13:46.194 --> 13:48.795
Today is not the day
he's gonna see me sweat.

13:53.334 --> 13:57.871
Mike, I'm sorry, but...
It's time.

13:57.873 --> 13:59.439
I can't. I just...

13:59.441 --> 14:00.940
Look, I know it's hard,

14:00.942 --> 14:03.109
but if you don't go up there
and say something, there...

14:03.111 --> 14:05.712
There's just no one else.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.715
There's no--

14:08.717 --> 14:10.850
none of these people
even know her.

14:10.852 --> 14:13.052
You're not speaking for them.

14:13.054 --> 14:15.588
You're speaking for you.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.857
Everyone is gone.

14:17.859 --> 14:21.261
Not everyone.

14:21.263 --> 14:22.262
Tess?

14:22.264 --> 14:23.997
Mike.

14:23.999 --> 14:26.566
- How did you--
- My mom.

14:26.568 --> 14:30.103
I'm so sorry.

14:30.105 --> 14:31.638
What's going on?

14:31.640 --> 14:34.274
- He doesn't want to speak.
- I can't.

14:34.276 --> 14:37.911
You can.

14:37.913 --> 14:39.045
What's your name?

14:39.047 --> 14:40.813
- Rachel.
- Mike,

14:40.815 --> 14:43.816
Rachel and I
are gonna be right here.

14:43.818 --> 14:45.351
You can do this.

14:45.353 --> 14:48.655
I promise, you're gonna feel
so much better after.

14:48.657 --> 14:51.024
Or you'll feel
a hundred times worse.

14:52.861 --> 14:56.095
Either way, you gotta do it.

15:00.301 --> 15:03.002
Okay.

15:03.004 --> 15:07.540
I, uh...remember things.

15:07.542 --> 15:13.546
I remember the night that my
parents were taken away from me.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.384
I remember my grandmother
taking me in.

15:18.386 --> 15:20.186
She came to check on me.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.021
It was, uh...

15:22.023 --> 15:25.291
It was the middle
of the night, and...

15:25.293 --> 15:29.062
I had wet the bed.

15:29.064 --> 15:30.196
And she cleaned the sheets,!

15:30.198 --> 15:32.098
And she--she cleaned me all up,

15:32.100 --> 15:36.703
and she put me
in her bed, and, uh...

15:36.705 --> 15:42.709
you know, I...started to cry.

15:42.711 --> 15:48.314
Really hard, and, uh...

15:48.316 --> 15:52.352
and she said,
"It's okay, Michael.

15:52.354 --> 15:55.555
"It's okay.

15:55.557 --> 15:58.758
"I've been crying too.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.793
"But don't you wet this bed,

16:00.795 --> 16:05.098
because I have
to sleep here too."

16:08.235 --> 16:09.736
And, uh...

16:09.738 --> 16:13.740
You know, we laughed,
you know?

16:13.742 --> 16:18.277
In spite of everything,
we laughed, and...

16:18.279 --> 16:19.445
and we kept laughing.

16:19.447 --> 16:24.684
We kept laughing
until I fell asleep.

16:24.686 --> 16:25.852
When I woke up the next morning,

16:25.854 --> 16:27.620
she wasn't just
my grandmother anymore.

16:27.622 --> 16:32.592
She was...

16:32.594 --> 16:36.596
she was my whole family.

16:40.634 --> 16:46.105
Well,
I'm not 11 years old anymore.

16:46.107 --> 16:49.776
I'm not gonna wet
the bed tonight.

16:49.778 --> 16:52.712
But I will remember...

16:52.714 --> 16:54.647
that night

16:54.649 --> 16:58.117
and everything
she has ever done for me.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.122
For the rest of my life.

17:10.664 --> 17:12.765
- You were great.
- Thank you.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.267
She's right.

17:14.269 --> 17:16.703
I'm Tess, by the way.
Oh, it's good to meet you,

17:16.704 --> 17:18.404
Tess.
Good to meet you, Rachel.

17:18.406 --> 17:19.539
Are you two...

17:19.540 --> 17:20.940
- Uh--
- Oh.

17:22.010 --> 17:23.876
No, no.
We work together.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.377
I assume you knew Edith?

17:25.380 --> 17:27.046
Grammy was the best part
about being friends

17:27.048 --> 17:28.981
with this guy.
Oh, you called her grammy too?

17:28.983 --> 17:32.018
- Oh, everybody did.
- So you guys must go way back.

17:32.020 --> 17:35.521
Short story is, we've known
each other since we were seven.

17:35.523 --> 17:38.024
Long story is,
you dated each other.

17:38.026 --> 17:40.593
Mm, I don't think we need
to get into the long story.

17:40.595 --> 17:41.761
We shared
a few milestones together.

17:41.763 --> 17:42.895
First beer,

17:42.897 --> 17:44.464
prom, sex...

17:44.466 --> 17:46.799
And there's the long story.

17:46.801 --> 17:47.967
Well, I don't
know about you two,

17:47.969 --> 17:49.168
but I think we should get drunk.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.937
I wish, but I have
to go pack up her room.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.239
I have to get
back to the office,

17:53.241 --> 17:57.910
and I do not want to see
you there later today, okay?

17:57.912 --> 17:59.212
- Thanks, Rachel.
- Yeah, of course.

17:59.214 --> 18:00.780
Let me know if you need
anything, just call me.

18:00.782 --> 18:01.914
- Mm-hmm.
- Really good to meet you.

18:01.916 --> 18:04.450
You too.

18:10.491 --> 18:13.192
Doth my eyes deceive me?

18:13.194 --> 18:14.494
It appears that you're actually
doing the task

18:14.496 --> 18:15.762
that you've been assigned.

18:15.764 --> 18:16.863
Doth you want to kiss my ass?

18:16.865 --> 18:18.197
I sense frustration.

18:18.199 --> 18:19.565
Case too much?

18:19.567 --> 18:22.101
Can't handle all those numbers?
Louis, just because

18:22.103 --> 18:23.536
financial cases bore me

18:23.538 --> 18:26.839
doesn't mean
I can't do them in my sleep.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.841
Well, did you remember
to do this?

18:28.843 --> 18:30.510
I didn't have to,
because I did that.

18:30.512 --> 18:31.644
Well, that means
that you have to--

18:31.646 --> 18:32.745
Replace the custodian,

18:32.747 --> 18:34.614
have an alternate,
show precedence,

18:34.616 --> 18:36.082
generate cash flow projections,

18:36.084 --> 18:39.285
and have everything audited
by an experienced fiduciary?

18:39.287 --> 18:41.120
Impressive.

18:41.122 --> 18:43.956
Well, I'll review these
for court, 4:00 p.m. today,

18:43.958 --> 18:45.358
where you will be
my second chair.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.893
Did I forget to mention that?

18:46.895 --> 18:48.094
My bad.

18:48.096 --> 18:49.495
Oh, and if you want
to pick up some coffee,

18:49.497 --> 18:50.596
I take mine with cream
and stevia.

18:55.936 --> 19:01.541
Would you like me
to put that in your calendar?

19:02.610 --> 19:04.710
I will take that as a "no."

19:06.680 --> 19:08.714
She loved you, you know?

19:08.716 --> 19:12.618
Pretty sure she never
got over our breakup.

19:12.620 --> 19:15.988
Well, that's because she knew
you would never do better.

19:19.494 --> 19:21.627
What's going on?

19:21.629 --> 19:26.199
I cancelled on her
the night before she died.

19:26.201 --> 19:27.767
You must feel awful.

19:27.769 --> 19:29.435
I was working.

19:29.437 --> 19:31.070
I don't even remember what for.

19:31.072 --> 19:34.273
And we're talking about me here.

19:34.275 --> 19:36.776
I just know it seemed
so important at the time,

19:36.778 --> 19:38.411
and now...

19:38.413 --> 19:42.348
I didn't even get
to say good-bye to her.

19:42.350 --> 19:45.117
But...

19:45.119 --> 19:49.355
never really get to say good-bye
to anyone, do I?

19:49.357 --> 19:51.591
The, uh...

19:51.593 --> 19:54.393
the night before
I went to college,

19:54.395 --> 19:57.496
I was supposed to see you,
and I couldn't.

19:57.498 --> 19:59.599
Yeah. Yeah, you were having
dinner with your family.

19:59.601 --> 20:01.734
Yeah.

20:01.736 --> 20:05.538
"Dinner with my family"
was me sobbing in my bed.

20:07.775 --> 20:11.444
We had said we'd break up
at the end of the summer, but...

20:11.446 --> 20:13.112
I knew if I showed up,

20:13.114 --> 20:15.147
I never would have been able
to do it.

20:15.149 --> 20:19.986
I'm sorry. I just...

20:19.988 --> 20:23.756
I didn't have the guts
to say good-bye.

20:23.758 --> 20:25.324
It's okay.

20:50.384 --> 20:53.085
Mike...

20:53.087 --> 20:56.689
I'm married.

20:56.691 --> 20:58.324
You

20:58.326 --> 21:00.893
are you kidding me?

21:00.895 --> 21:03.396
Wait--

21:03.398 --> 21:05.131
- Mike--
- Get out.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.800
Right.

21:07.802 --> 21:09.635
- Go.
- All right.

21:31.896 --> 21:33.129
When I sent you home,

21:33.131 --> 21:36.966
I didn't mean for you
to never come back.

21:36.968 --> 21:39.135
My grandmother died.

21:39.137 --> 21:40.937
I know.

21:40.939 --> 21:44.574
Look, you obviously weren't
ready to deal with it,

21:44.576 --> 21:47.043
so I respected that
by keeping you busy.

21:47.045 --> 21:50.346
Was I wrong?

21:50.348 --> 21:53.016
No.

21:53.018 --> 21:55.185
- Are you stoned?
- Yep.

21:55.187 --> 21:57.754
And I'm not interested
in a lecture, so--

21:57.756 --> 22:01.424
Good, 'cause I'm not
interested in giving one.

22:06.263 --> 22:09.132
Yeah, help yourself.

22:09.134 --> 22:12.268
Don't mind if I do.

22:18.143 --> 22:20.477
Is this the coffee cart guy?

22:28.352 --> 22:30.920
Look, Donna,
for the record,

22:30.922 --> 22:34.657
I am sorry that you got caught
in this crossfire.

22:34.659 --> 22:37.861
And no matter
what happens with--

22:37.863 --> 22:41.698
there will always
be a place here for you.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.333
With you?

22:43.335 --> 22:44.701
Yeah. Yes.

22:44.703 --> 22:46.369
It would be my honor.

22:46.371 --> 22:50.340
You really don't get it,
do you?

22:50.342 --> 22:53.176
Harvey and I are like this.

22:53.178 --> 22:55.011
You think I would leave
him for anybody,

22:55.013 --> 22:57.180
let alone somebody
who did what you did?

22:57.182 --> 22:59.382
You betrayed your team.

22:59.384 --> 23:01.484
Harvey and Jessica
were not my team.

23:01.486 --> 23:02.886
Yes, they were.

23:02.888 --> 23:05.822
And I was.
But no one is anymore.

23:05.824 --> 23:08.258
And I might not like moving,

23:08.260 --> 23:10.627
but the one thing
that I love about it

23:10.629 --> 23:16.432
is that it is further away
from your smug face.

23:16.434 --> 23:18.601
The whole bag?

23:18.603 --> 23:20.170
How do you even do that, man?

23:20.172 --> 23:23.039
It's like--I've got, like,
crazy cotton mouth right now.

23:23.041 --> 23:25.708
Harvey Specter doesn't
get cotton "mouff."

23:25.710 --> 23:27.143
- Cotton "mouff"?
- Mouff.

23:27.145 --> 23:30.013
I guess Harvey
Specter does get cotton "mouff."

23:30.015 --> 23:31.548
I can't help it,
these pretzels...

23:31.550 --> 23:34.050
Are making me thirsty!

23:37.589 --> 23:41.457
- Here, drink this, rookie.
- Oh, my God, I--

23:48.567 --> 23:52.702
Did you ever hear of a hanger?
Oh, God, wow!

23:54.406 --> 23:56.472
I just got an image
of you as a dad.

23:56.474 --> 23:58.775
With, like, a little
Harvey Specter, you know,

23:58.777 --> 24:00.476
all hair-gelled, and, like,

24:00.478 --> 24:02.812
pinstripe Oshkosh B'gosh.

24:02.814 --> 24:04.948
"Dad, don't play the odds,
play the man.

24:04.950 --> 24:06.516
It's--it's a win-win."
You being like,

24:06.518 --> 24:09.385
"go to your goddamn room."
Oh, look at this.

24:09.387 --> 24:11.721
You bought an apartment
in Manhattan.

24:11.723 --> 24:14.224
I got it for her.

24:16.727 --> 24:18.061
Oh.

24:21.599 --> 24:24.867
I always hated
the word "orphan."

24:24.869 --> 24:30.707
I mean, I just--
I never felt like one.

24:30.709 --> 24:33.243
Until now.

24:38.048 --> 24:39.349
I ever tell you about my dad?

24:39.351 --> 24:44.787
I think you know
the answer to that question.

24:44.789 --> 24:46.589
He was a saxophone player.

24:46.591 --> 24:49.525
He sat in with everybody
because everybody loved him.

24:49.527 --> 24:51.628
He believed in love
at first sight,

24:51.630 --> 24:56.032
and unfortunately...

24:56.034 --> 24:59.769
his first sight was a groupie.

24:59.771 --> 25:01.504
Your mother.

25:01.506 --> 25:04.741
I was 16
when I caught her cheating.

25:04.743 --> 25:10.113
I knew if I told my dad he'd--

25:10.115 --> 25:13.049
next two years went by,
I didn't say a thing,

25:13.051 --> 25:16.352
and she went right on just...

25:16.354 --> 25:19.722
making him a fool.

25:19.724 --> 25:21.324
Look, this is all to say that,

25:21.326 --> 25:24.594
I lived in a house
surrounded by family,

25:24.596 --> 25:28.531
but I know what it's like
to be totally alone.

25:28.533 --> 25:32.101
Wow.

25:32.103 --> 25:34.871
Your stoned is depressing.

25:34.873 --> 25:37.674
You should never share
your feelings ever again.

25:37.676 --> 25:39.309
I mean, not with me.

25:39.311 --> 25:41.311
I gotta say, it's been
a tough week for both of us.

25:41.313 --> 25:44.314
- Hardman.
- Oh, what I wouldn't give

25:44.316 --> 25:46.082
to piss in that
bastard's office.

25:47.185 --> 25:48.851
That was pretty quick
off the tongue.

25:48.853 --> 25:50.920
Well, I've done it before.

25:50.922 --> 25:52.522
To Louis.
No way.

25:52.524 --> 25:54.223
Way.

25:57.862 --> 26:00.830
Wait a minute.

26:00.832 --> 26:02.098
If you've done that before--

26:02.100 --> 26:05.068
Why not do it again?

26:15.145 --> 26:16.212
Okay. Let's go.

26:16.214 --> 26:17.380
No, no, no, no, no.

26:17.382 --> 26:18.448
It's not right.

26:18.450 --> 26:19.515
It's not right?

26:19.517 --> 26:20.750
I drank three Gatorades
on the way here.

26:20.752 --> 26:22.051
I'm gonna pee orange.
It's right.

26:23.254 --> 26:24.854
No.

26:24.856 --> 26:26.356
If we're gonna do something,

26:26.358 --> 26:28.057
it needs to be original.
Orange.

26:28.059 --> 26:30.793
No

26:30.795 --> 26:32.228
you know what?

26:32.230 --> 26:35.298
I know what we're gonna do.

26:38.502 --> 26:42.138
I'm gonna get the can opener.

26:44.808 --> 26:46.442
Are you serious right now?
You're not messing with me?

26:46.444 --> 26:47.577
You're finally gonna tell me

26:47.579 --> 26:48.745
what you do with
that can opener?

26:48.747 --> 26:50.346
- Do I look serious?
- You look stoned.

26:50.348 --> 26:53.883
I am, but I never joke
about the can opener.

26:53.885 --> 26:55.551
Come on.
Mmm.

26:55.553 --> 26:57.420
Let's go, let's go.

26:57.422 --> 26:59.288
- All right, go.
- All right...

26:59.290 --> 27:01.257
What we do is--

27:12.336 --> 27:14.404
Okay, if you were
a narcissist with great hair,

27:14.406 --> 27:15.571
what would your password be?

27:15.573 --> 27:21.077
Pssh, Harvey.

27:21.079 --> 27:23.880
Specter.

27:23.882 --> 27:25.081
No, that's just way too easy.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.717
One of his favorite
basketball players.

27:27.719 --> 27:33.055
Shaquille O'Bryant?

27:37.961 --> 27:40.062
I still don't understand
the thumbtack thing.

27:40.064 --> 27:44.300
- Surprising, isn't it?
- Yeah.

27:44.302 --> 27:46.002
Hey, say what you will
about this floor,

27:46.004 --> 27:48.271
I'm pretty sure the cubicles
are bigger.

27:54.978 --> 27:57.246
Hey, what's going on?
How you guys doing?

27:57.248 --> 27:59.382
I was just, uh, helping
box a little bit,

27:59.384 --> 28:01.451
'cause, uh, Donna was feeling
a little blue about moving.

28:01.453 --> 28:03.486
What the hell are you doing?

28:03.488 --> 28:05.488
Harvey.
Harvey!

28:05.490 --> 28:07.790
You looking for another way
to make my life miserable?

28:07.792 --> 28:08.925
Harvey! Harvey, no!

28:08.927 --> 28:11.794
Come on.
You hit him, they win.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.309
You should of let me hit him.

28:25.310 --> 28:26.743
Oh, I don't know about that,

28:26.745 --> 28:29.178
but maybe we shouldn't have
let him leave.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.246
Why?

28:30.248 --> 28:31.681
Eh, uh, maybe
he wasn't snooping.

28:31.683 --> 28:33.516
Maybe he was, I don't know,
trying to plant something,

28:33.518 --> 28:35.585
like-- like drugs.
In my record collection?

28:35.587 --> 28:36.786
What better place to stash

28:36.788 --> 28:39.455
the weed than with
the Bob Marley, man?

28:39.457 --> 28:41.457
Louis doesn't even know where
to buy drugs,

28:41.459 --> 28:43.459
let alone plant them.

28:43.461 --> 28:45.628
- I know where to buy drugs.
- Congratulations.

28:45.630 --> 28:47.764
No, I'm serious.
What if instead of peeing,

28:47.766 --> 28:49.098
we planted something
in Hardman's office.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.566
Unh, genius!

28:50.568 --> 28:52.001
- It's a crime.
- Mm, maybe.

28:52.003 --> 28:53.469
But he wouldn't hesitate
for one second

28:53.471 --> 28:57.006
to do the same thing
to get rid of you.

28:57.008 --> 28:58.474
What?

28:58.476 --> 29:00.376
He wouldn't hesitate to plant
something to get rid of me.

29:00.378 --> 29:02.712
- What, Louis?
- No, Hardman.

29:02.714 --> 29:04.147
- I just said that.
- No.

29:04.149 --> 29:07.283
What if Hardman planted
the CM memo in the first place?

29:07.285 --> 29:08.684
Well.

29:08.686 --> 29:10.086
Donna never saw the memo.

29:10.088 --> 29:13.222
Donna never makes mistakes.

29:13.224 --> 29:14.924
What if she never saw
it four years ago

29:14.926 --> 29:19.195
because it wasn't there?

29:19.197 --> 29:22.165
And then it was.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.200
You really think
he had the balls

29:24.202 --> 29:25.535
to walk into that file room,

29:25.537 --> 29:27.470
open a box,
and plant a document?

29:27.472 --> 29:30.306
There's no security cameras
and no locks on the doors.

29:30.308 --> 29:32.275
Fine, but how did he get
the document in the first place?

29:32.277 --> 29:34.043
Hardman brought Coastal Motors
into the firm.

29:34.045 --> 29:35.845
Yeah, but he wasn't here
when the case went to trial.

29:35.847 --> 29:37.680
No, not the trial,
the defect.

29:37.682 --> 29:39.849
What's the date
Sarah Layton left CM?

29:39.851 --> 29:42.618
There.

29:42.620 --> 29:44.253
- Hardman was still here.
- Makes sense.

29:44.255 --> 29:46.489
Sarah Layton confronts Kemp.

29:46.491 --> 29:48.691
He panics.
Who's the first person he calls?

29:48.693 --> 29:50.560
- His lawyer.
- Hardman tells him to bury it.

29:50.562 --> 29:52.028
That's a crime.

29:52.030 --> 29:54.063
You said yourself he wouldn't
hesitate to commit a crime.

29:54.065 --> 29:57.433
He knew the cars were bad
from the beginning.

29:57.435 --> 29:59.068
What?

29:59.070 --> 30:00.636
When Hardman came back,

30:00.638 --> 30:02.305
the first thing he did
was ask Louis for a report

30:02.307 --> 30:04.106
on every case at the firm.

30:04.108 --> 30:06.108
Yeah, he was looking
for weaknesses.

30:06.110 --> 30:07.743
He knew the CM win
was based on a lie,

30:07.745 --> 30:10.580
made it look like it was my lie.
Which brings us to?

30:10.582 --> 30:11.848
Tanner.

30:11.850 --> 30:13.416
Hardman couldn't bring
the suit himself.

30:13.418 --> 30:14.650
He needed an executioner.

30:14.652 --> 30:16.352
And he picked Tanner.

30:16.354 --> 30:18.087
So when I suspected
something was fishy,

30:18.089 --> 30:21.324
I'd focus on Tanner, not him.

30:21.326 --> 30:22.859
They were in on it together.

30:22.861 --> 30:24.727
I went through every box
that Hardman looked at,

30:24.729 --> 30:26.095
to find dirt on Tanner.

30:26.097 --> 30:27.230
There was no dirt.

30:27.232 --> 30:28.598
You need to call
a partner meeting.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.766
I'll call for it...

30:30.768 --> 30:33.002
five minutes after
you get me some proof.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.044
Sorry, Harvey.
Pilates is on Wednesdays.

30:42.046 --> 30:43.613
You and I are gonna go.

30:43.615 --> 30:45.515
And when we're done,

30:45.517 --> 30:48.017
you're gonna admit
to me what you did.

30:48.019 --> 30:49.986
Oh, I've done
a lot of things, Harvey.

30:49.988 --> 30:51.487
Well, I want to know
why you settled.

30:51.489 --> 30:52.889
You know damn well
why I settled.

30:52.891 --> 30:53.956
No, I don't.

30:53.958 --> 30:55.491
I want to know about
you and Hardman,

30:55.493 --> 30:57.627
and you're gonna answer
my questions,

30:57.629 --> 30:59.262
or I'm gonna kick
your ass.

30:59.264 --> 31:02.298
I'm not doing the one,
and you can't do the other.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.033
I can, and you will.

31:04.035 --> 31:05.067
All right, let's go.

31:05.069 --> 31:06.135
As long as it takes.

31:06.137 --> 31:08.971
I win, you talk?

31:08.973 --> 31:11.574
You lose, I don't.

31:22.519 --> 31:23.519
Unh.

31:23.521 --> 31:24.520
Uh!

31:31.428 --> 31:33.429
Oh!

31:33.431 --> 31:36.265
Why'd you settle?

31:36.267 --> 31:38.034
Unh!
I decline to answer.

31:39.202 --> 31:40.903
Ohh!
Why'd you settle?

31:43.373 --> 31:45.508
I decline to answer.

31:50.614 --> 31:52.148
Unh!

31:59.222 --> 32:01.157
Unh!

32:10.601 --> 32:11.601
Yah!

32:23.847 --> 32:25.247
You get one question.

32:25.249 --> 32:26.716
Well, let's see.

32:26.718 --> 32:30.119
How about, why'd you settle?

32:30.121 --> 32:31.721
Because that memo was a fraud.

32:31.723 --> 32:34.290
What? You need
to come forward--

32:34.292 --> 32:36.592
No, no, no, no, no.
I said one question, Harvey.

32:36.594 --> 32:40.129
One question.

32:50.374 --> 32:52.508
Oh, my God.

32:52.510 --> 32:53.976
We were right.

32:53.978 --> 32:56.579
Right about what?

32:56.581 --> 32:59.615
- You found what?
- I found it!

33:02.586 --> 33:04.120
Mm.

33:04.122 --> 33:05.321
Mm.

33:05.323 --> 33:06.856
Mm.

33:06.858 --> 33:08.090
No, no.

33:08.092 --> 33:09.925
It can't be--
it can't be like this.

33:09.927 --> 33:11.027
Why?

33:11.029 --> 33:12.428
Because your grandmother
just died.

33:12.430 --> 33:14.664
You think not kissing is going
to make that any better?

33:14.666 --> 33:16.365
No, no, I think that's exactly
what it's gonna do,

33:16.367 --> 33:17.800
and that's why it's a problem.

33:17.802 --> 33:20.036
Rachel, in the middle
of the worst week ever,

33:20.038 --> 33:21.971
I have found a moment
of something good.

33:21.973 --> 33:25.508
Now, ple--
I know.

33:25.510 --> 33:26.776
But when something
like that happens,

33:26.778 --> 33:32.715
people don't make smart choices.

33:32.717 --> 33:34.417
Yeah.

33:34.419 --> 33:37.520
No, you're right.

33:37.522 --> 33:39.722
But being smart...

33:39.724 --> 33:43.359
hasn't made either
one of us very happy.

33:56.297 --> 33:57.463
- Daniel.
- Louis.

33:57.465 --> 33:59.599
I have something
that may be of interest.

33:59.601 --> 34:00.767
Already?

34:00.769 --> 34:03.303
I'm notoriously fast.

34:03.305 --> 34:04.837
I have certain suspicions.

34:04.839 --> 34:08.174
All I need you to do
is authorize action.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.976
You really think he does?

34:09.978 --> 34:13.646
I really think he did.

34:13.648 --> 34:14.947
I am impressed.

34:14.949 --> 34:16.382
You'd be surprised
what can do now

34:16.384 --> 34:19.686
that I have
the proper motivation.

34:24.757 --> 34:26.025
You're banned on this floor.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.427
That's funny.

34:27.429 --> 34:30.263
It's pee in a cup time.

34:30.264 --> 34:32.297
Drug tests are for associates,
not the partners.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.600
Yeah, well Hardman believes
in running a real clean ship.

34:34.601 --> 34:37.103
You know, like "just say no.
Crack is whack."

34:37.105 --> 34:39.906
Which is why a new policy went
into effect as of this morning.

34:39.908 --> 34:41.074
You know, I don't smell
it on you now,

34:41.076 --> 34:42.241
but I sure as hell
did last night

34:42.243 --> 34:43.842
when you manhandled me
in your office.

34:43.844 --> 34:45.378
I'm sure you had a lot
of fun laughing at that one.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.181
You want to take it, you're
gonna have to take it forcibly.

34:48.183 --> 34:49.349
Refusal to take this test

34:49.351 --> 34:50.949
gives me grounds
to fire you for cause.

34:50.952 --> 34:52.351
- I refuse.
- You're fired.

34:52.353 --> 34:54.754
Per our bylaws, I'm entitled
to a hearing in front of

34:54.755 --> 34:58.024
a quorum of our senior partners,
and I'm on record.

34:58.026 --> 34:59.359
What the hell
is wrong with you?

34:59.361 --> 35:01.361
Just take the test.

35:01.363 --> 35:02.695
- I can't.
- Why not?

35:02.697 --> 35:06.332
It's just a drug--

35:06.334 --> 35:08.267
you've got to be kidding me.
- You were the one who told me

35:08.269 --> 35:09.602
to take it easy.

35:09.604 --> 35:11.371
And you and I both know
what we did that night

35:11.373 --> 35:12.705
in this very office.

35:12.707 --> 35:16.209
That was a celebration.
This is different, th--

35:16.211 --> 35:18.678
when did this happen?

35:18.680 --> 35:20.546
Does it matter when?

35:20.548 --> 35:21.981
I don't believe it.

35:21.983 --> 35:23.116
You were high

35:23.118 --> 35:24.817
when you came up
with that theory.

35:24.819 --> 35:26.452
Doesn't matter how
we got there, we got there.

35:26.454 --> 35:28.554
I bought us some time.

35:28.556 --> 35:30.223
We can use the review
to present our case.

35:30.225 --> 35:31.457
Do you have any evidence?

35:31.459 --> 35:33.192
Not only did
he plant the document,

35:33.194 --> 35:34.327
he wrote the damn thing.

35:34.329 --> 35:35.461
How do you know that?

35:35.463 --> 35:37.997
Tanner...indicated that to me.

35:37.999 --> 35:40.400
Turns out, they weren't
in on it together.

35:40.402 --> 35:42.468
Huh. And he's willing
to testify to that.

35:42.470 --> 35:45.838
Oh, let me guess.
No, he won't.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.440
I've got Mike chasing
down another avenue.

35:47.442 --> 35:51.544
Jessica, I don't do this now,
I'm gone anyway.

35:53.881 --> 35:55.014
What is it?

35:55.016 --> 35:56.983
Daniel and Louis
got their quorum.

35:56.985 --> 35:59.419
Your review convenes in an hour.

36:07.528 --> 36:08.928
Pursuant to New York
civil code,

36:08.930 --> 36:11.030
a settlement based
on fraudulent representation

36:11.032 --> 36:13.966
can be voided by the court.
Who are you?

36:13.968 --> 36:16.135
My name's Mike Ross.
I work for Harvey Specter.

36:17.872 --> 36:19.972
Get off my car.

36:19.974 --> 36:22.308
As far as we can tell,
there were only two people

36:22.310 --> 36:23.976
who knew about the problems
with the CM hood.

36:23.978 --> 36:27.547
Sarah Layton, and you.

36:27.549 --> 36:28.881
But I think there was a third.

36:30.185 --> 36:32.018
You know, last time I was
ambushed in this garage,

36:32.020 --> 36:33.719
I gave in.
Not this time.

36:33.721 --> 36:35.188
You met with Daniel Hardman

36:35.190 --> 36:38.157
the night before
Sarah Layton's last day.

36:38.159 --> 36:39.492
We have his calendar.

36:39.494 --> 36:40.793
What do you want?

36:40.795 --> 36:43.296
I want you to sign
this affidavit stating

36:43.298 --> 36:45.865
you told Daniel Hardman about
the problems with the hood,

36:45.867 --> 36:47.767
and that he advised you
to bury those problems

36:47.769 --> 36:49.268
and cut a deal
with Sarah Layton.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.473
Harvey came to me,

36:53.475 --> 36:55.341
told me to settle,
and then we'd be done.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.843
Now you're threatening me,

36:56.845 --> 36:59.579
telling me to put it in writing,
and then we'll be done.

36:59.581 --> 37:02.248
Sorry, junior.

37:02.250 --> 37:07.320
We <i>are</i> done.

37:12.726 --> 37:14.160
That kid better get here fast.

37:14.162 --> 37:15.495
He'll come through.

37:15.497 --> 37:17.163
Harvey Specter has refused
to take a mandatory

37:17.165 --> 37:21.134
drug test, leaving me no choice
but to terminate his employment.

37:21.136 --> 37:22.668
As is his right,

37:22.670 --> 37:25.204
he has requested a hearing
to dispute this.

37:25.206 --> 37:26.439
Thank you, Daniel,

37:26.441 --> 37:28.207
but I'm not here
to dispute anything.

37:28.209 --> 37:29.775
After all, I was high.

37:29.777 --> 37:33.980
I was high because I was being
forced to work for you.

37:33.982 --> 37:37.750
A man who, it turns out,
knew CM was negligent

37:37.752 --> 37:39.552
before I ever even
took the case.

37:39.554 --> 37:41.554
- Uh, this is not the time--
- Shut up, Louis.

37:41.556 --> 37:42.688
Don't do this.

37:42.690 --> 37:47.026
If you go, I go.

37:47.028 --> 37:48.961
Do you deny knowing
about the defects?

37:48.963 --> 37:50.730
Unequivocally.

37:50.732 --> 37:52.365
And you deny writing
this memo?

37:52.367 --> 37:53.666
Sending it to Tanner,

37:53.668 --> 37:56.869
knowing that he would come
after this entire firm?

37:56.871 --> 37:58.437
That's why he settled.

37:58.439 --> 38:00.573
Because you told him
it wouldn't hold up.

38:00.575 --> 38:02.575
That's wild conjecture,

38:02.577 --> 38:03.809
and it's bullshit.

38:03.811 --> 38:04.944
Why'd he settle?

38:04.946 --> 38:07.079
He settled
because I did what I do.

38:07.081 --> 38:08.214
That is not an answer.

38:08.216 --> 38:10.550
Yes. It is.

38:10.552 --> 38:11.951
This ends here.

38:11.953 --> 38:13.719
The two of you
have now slandered me,

38:13.721 --> 38:15.788
which violates
the morality clause

38:15.790 --> 38:17.023
of the partners' agreement.

38:17.025 --> 38:18.558
It's not slander
if it's the truth.

38:18.560 --> 38:23.196
Unfortunately, you don't have
a shred of evidence,

38:23.198 --> 38:25.665
because the evidence
doesn't exist.

38:25.667 --> 38:26.999
Well, actually, it does.

38:27.001 --> 38:29.035
This is a partners-only
meeting.

38:29.037 --> 38:30.169
So have Tanner sue me.

38:30.171 --> 38:31.637
But in the meantime,

38:31.639 --> 38:33.105
I think the rest of the partners
are gonna want to see this.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.908
It's a signed affidavit
from Lawrence Kemp,

38:35.910 --> 38:39.078
stating that he told
Daniel Hardman about the defects

38:39.080 --> 38:40.913
in the CM hood six years ago.

38:40.915 --> 38:42.949
May 7th was the date
of that meeting,

38:42.951 --> 38:47.954
per your calendar,
to be exact.

38:47.956 --> 38:50.389
You just denied knowing
anything about that,

38:50.391 --> 38:52.158
unequivocally.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.026
I guess you were just lying
to cover up the fact

38:54.028 --> 38:58.731
that you were behind this entire
suit in the first place.

38:58.733 --> 39:01.367
Is that the basis of this?

39:01.369 --> 39:04.804
A coerced lie
from a man trying to say,

39:04.806 --> 39:08.140
"my lawyer made me do it."

39:08.142 --> 39:10.743
No way that holds up in court.
It doesn't have to.

39:10.745 --> 39:12.211
It just has to make these

39:12.213 --> 39:14.680
Harvard-educated
lawyers understand

39:14.682 --> 39:18.918
that you made each and every one
of them spend $100,000

39:18.920 --> 39:20.286
of their own money

39:20.288 --> 39:22.755
to buy you control of my firm.

39:22.757 --> 39:25.191
I think we've heard
all we needed to hear.

39:25.193 --> 39:28.261
Harvey has admitted
to violating the drug policy.

39:28.263 --> 39:32.098
All those in favor
of his dismissal?

39:38.405 --> 39:40.206
Looks like you lost.

39:40.208 --> 39:41.874
I'm glad you brought
up the bylaws.

39:41.876 --> 39:46.145
Fraudulently suing your own firm
is grounds for firing.

39:46.147 --> 39:48.080
You have no proof of that.

39:48.082 --> 39:54.086
All those in favor
of Daniel Hardman's dismissal?

39:56.123 --> 39:58.658
Hey, Harvey, I know I'm not
a partner, but do you mind?

39:58.660 --> 40:00.926
- Go ahead.
- Nice.

40:00.928 --> 40:03.963
Daniel, that $3 million
of our money

40:03.965 --> 40:07.133
you spent on yourself.

40:07.135 --> 40:11.570
Consider your partnership
bought out.

40:11.572 --> 40:14.774
What was really
on that affidavit, anyway?

40:14.776 --> 40:16.509
What I said was on it.

40:16.511 --> 40:18.778
You realize it's a felony
to sign someone else's name

40:18.780 --> 40:20.046
to a sworn document.

40:20.048 --> 40:23.316
I didn't sign someone
else's name.

40:23.318 --> 40:25.851
I signed my own name.

40:25.853 --> 40:27.153
I mean, seriously,

40:27.155 --> 40:31.090
how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

40:34.494 --> 40:37.663
To the firm of Pearson
and kiss my ass.

40:37.665 --> 40:40.266
I told you we'd
be peeling him off the wall.

40:40.268 --> 40:43.002
You go, I go.

40:43.004 --> 40:45.905
He goes.

40:45.907 --> 40:48.007
I already went and came back.

41:05.492 --> 41:07.326
You're married.

41:07.328 --> 41:09.595
I am.

41:09.597 --> 41:11.697
You called me anyway.

41:11.699 --> 41:13.299
I did.

41:24.745 --> 41:27.179
So we're clear...

41:27.181 --> 41:30.216
I don't consider anything
bought out.

41:30.218 --> 41:31.650
Too bad.

41:31.652 --> 41:33.519
'Cause the only way
you're getting another penny

41:33.521 --> 41:35.354
is through litigation.

41:35.356 --> 41:38.090
We may not have proof now,
but we will.

41:38.092 --> 41:41.961
If this comes out at trial,
you'll never practice again.

41:41.963 --> 41:44.330
Sign this confidentiality
agreement.

41:44.332 --> 41:46.365
I'll waive my claim.

41:46.367 --> 41:51.337
One time offer.
Take it or leave it.

41:53.340 --> 41:56.108
For the record, I wasn't
the one who made the first move.

41:56.110 --> 41:57.443
Harvey was.

41:57.445 --> 42:01.747
Yeah, you made your first
move five years ago.

42:01.749 --> 42:05.384
Maybe. But someday...

42:05.386 --> 42:07.520
He'll make the first move
on you.

42:07.522 --> 42:10.756
Goodbye, Daniel.

42:12.092 --> 42:14.927
Are you gonna throw something
at me?

42:14.929 --> 42:18.330
I'll go.

42:18.332 --> 42:24.336
But don't kid yourself that this
is the last page of the story.

42:27.874 --> 42:30.576
- Give me your toes.
- No.

42:33.381 --> 42:35.448
Oh, just like riding a bike.

42:35.450 --> 42:36.916
Oh, okay.

42:36.918 --> 42:39.251
I should be more upset that you
just compared me to a bike,

42:39.253 --> 42:41.520
but I love bikes.

42:41.522 --> 42:44.657
Mmm, mwah.

42:44.659 --> 42:47.026
- Pizza.
- Okay.

42:47.028 --> 42:48.227
Unh.
Oh!

42:48.229 --> 42:50.996
Pepperoni.

42:50.998 --> 42:53.032
Is this a bad time
to tell you that I'm a vegan?

42:53.034 --> 42:55.067
Um, no.

42:55.069 --> 42:56.202
More pizza for me.

42:56.204 --> 42:59.071
Mwah.

43:03.376 --> 43:05.110
You were right.

43:05.112 --> 43:08.647
I don't care about being smart.
