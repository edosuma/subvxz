WEBVTT

00:46.463 --> 00:48.131
Good job today.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.967
Put the equipment in each basket
and return them safely.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.469
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.055
Check if we missed anything.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.853
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

01:01.936 --> 01:02.896
No, I'm okay.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.688
Give me the flask.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.275
Thank you.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.195
-Give me that too.
-Okay.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.120
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

01:21.664 --> 01:23.249
What is it?
Hydroxide solution?

01:23.833 --> 01:26.086
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.547
-Go wash it off and go to the dispensary.
-Okay.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.258
-Watch the glass.
-Hey!

01:38.890 --> 01:40.433
I told you to be careful.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.019
I'm sorry.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.708
I'm sorry.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.836
It's okay. It was just a little shard.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.753
Thank god
it wasn't on your face.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.760
-Sua.
-Hey!

02:17.387 --> 02:18.555
I'm sorry.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.808
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! </i>BY KI MAENG-GI

02:21.891 --> 02:23.643
Thanks, Won-ho.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.022
A box of bandages without ointment?
What was he thinking?

02:32.735 --> 02:35.488
-Take it off carefully.
-I'll go pick up some ointment.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.241
It's okay. The cut isn't deep.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.275
You must love vending machines.

03:13.067 --> 03:16.487
I heard you cleaned up
all the broken glass. I'm sorry.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.114
I didn't do it for you.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.535
You're always so prickly toward me.
I find it quite impressive.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.040
Impressive?
I can't beat you on that front.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.215
-It must be fun.
-What?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.634
Having fun with the guy
who has a crush on you.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.470
That's not what's going on.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.181
-Sua.
-Hey, Sua.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.601
-You got hurt?
-You want me to carry you?

03:46.684 --> 03:49.771
-It's not a big deal.
-Come on, it's a big deal to me.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.148
-Hey, get down.
-No, it's okay.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.066
Get on my back.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.735
-My back is broader.
-No, mine's broader.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.819
-Sua!
-Sua!

03:56.945 --> 04:00.031
Hey, it's fine.
She's fine. She's okay.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.241
I'm okay.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.327
-She's okay! Sua's okay!
-Nice!

04:04.410 --> 04:05.453
Let's go eat.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.251
How's your hand? Is it okay?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.211
Yes.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.547
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.844
-Are you really the one who broke it?
-I am.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.942
Hiring an announcer or something?
Why can't a waitress have a dialect?

04:36.025 --> 04:38.569
How can you fall in love at first sight?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.072
What do you like about him?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.658
He has a beautiful smile.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.953
I didn't know that kind of smile was
considered beautiful.

04:47.036 --> 04:52.292
The moment he smiled, I felt a rush
of dopamine spreading through my body.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.671
Dopamine?

04:58.798 --> 04:59.799
Eat up.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.552
Let me do it. You might get hurt again.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.430
-No, I'm okay.
-Give me the flask.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.308
Thank you.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.693
Why aren't you eating?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.821
Because of the mistake earlier?

05:22.655 --> 05:23.823
No.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.409
Because the TA yelled at you?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.870
He didn't.
He just told her to be careful.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.877
By the way,

05:36.878 --> 05:40.256
Chan-woo didn't do anything to you
after that incident, did he?

05:41.049 --> 05:41.883
No.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.386
I wasn't going to tell you this
because it was a private discussion.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.306
Woo-young called me
to his office that day.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.851
Chan-woo gathered all the freshmen
from our year.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.688
<i>He had already heard about what happened.</i>
<i>So I just told him everything.</i>

05:57.190 --> 06:00.443
Well, I told you that wench,
Mi-rae, hit me first.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.364
Do you believe the freshmen's words
over my words?

06:04.739 --> 06:05.573
Hey, Chan-woo.

06:08.993 --> 06:13.331
Regardless of the reason,
if you bother freshmen one more time,

06:14.582 --> 06:16.793
I'm going to do my best
to ruin your future.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.964
I'm going to talk to every single freshman
and expose every bad deed you've done.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.301
I'll make sure
you get no reference letter.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.011
Even if you manage to get a job,

06:27.095 --> 06:30.223
I'll tell our alumni in the field
about everything you've done.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.020
Just a moment.
Didn't you say you'll pay for this?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.359
-Hello.
-I'll pay for everything.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.158
Thank you.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.078
-Thank you.
-Sure thing, I'll see you around.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.456
That's the true example of a senior.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.710
<i>I was getting sick of being the rep</i>
<i>and coming to school because of Chan-woo.</i>

07:00.795 --> 07:03.631
<i>But Woo-young made me feel</i>
<i>a lot more comfortable.</i>

07:08.970 --> 07:11.055
I guess I should've told you this.

07:17.103 --> 07:21.023
Our one on one customer strategy
started going viral,

07:21.107 --> 07:25.111
and a lot of celebrities promoted
our products via social media.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.030
So we're getting positive results
quicker than expected.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.951
Since our sales have become stable,
we're planning to strengthen

07:32.034 --> 07:34.162
our marketing strategy
by hiring a model.

07:34.245 --> 07:38.541
We're gonna increase our brand awareness
to expand our product line and sales.

07:38.666 --> 07:42.420
That way, we'll be able to maintain
our current product costs

07:42.503 --> 07:44.172
and increase sales at the same time.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.090
That sounds great.

07:46.466 --> 07:51.387
Perfumes rely on individual satisfaction
rather than other people's opinions.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.223
So I want to keep the characteristics
of our products.

07:54.891 --> 08:00.480
Please continue developing our brand
without losing our brand's characteristic.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.316
And consider making affiliate brands.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.193
Okay.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.072
Next, a briefing
about the perfume sampling event.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.538
Let's go.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.081
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.919
I can't believe you're a professor.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.087
My gosh.

09:06.671 --> 09:11.092
I still remember that you got scolded
for pretending to be MacGyver in the lab.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.136
Yes, I remember.
You're the one who started it.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.471
Really?

09:15.805 --> 09:18.975
Let me see. You haven't changed at all.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.810
You've become more cheerful.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.603
I've aged a lot.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.980
You look nice.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.606
Hello, professor.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.734
Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.946
Remember the thesis I sent you last time?
He wrote it.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.699
Oh, really?

09:36.742 --> 09:37.702
Hello.

09:47.211 --> 09:52.091
<i>I was getting sick of being the rep</i>
<i>and coming to school because of Chan-woo.</i>

09:52.758 --> 09:55.261
<i>But Woo-young made me</i>
<i>feel a lot more comfortable.</i>

10:03.185 --> 10:04.437
Hi, Mom.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.106
You're eating lunch now?

10:07.189 --> 10:10.359
I had a busy schedule.
Having a lot of work to do is good.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.862
I'll do part-time jobs
for the surgery bills,

10:12.945 --> 10:14.196
so don't work too hard.

10:16.032 --> 10:20.036
Hearing you say that is more than enough.
Just focus on studying and have fun.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.289
<i>-What about Dad?</i>
-What about him?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.000
He doesn't pick up my calls.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.794
-A combo menu, please.
-Okay.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.800
-Mom?
-Right.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.054
Don't worry.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.098
He'll call you soon,
so give him some time.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.852
Okay.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.608
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.027
You're here.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.571
-Hey.
-Yes?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.073
Take a photo of me.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.799
VOICE MESSAGE

11:14.882 --> 11:17.551
<i>Mi-rae told me</i>
<i>that she'll pay the surgery installment.</i>

11:18.386 --> 11:20.596
<i>Hearing her say that almost made me cry.</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:24.183
<i>Is this how you show your love</i>
<i>to your daughter?</i>

11:29.313 --> 11:30.773
<i>I get that you're upset.</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:33.943
<i>But what can you do?</i>
<i>What's done is done.</i>

11:34.777 --> 11:37.279
<i>There is only so much I can tolerate.</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:42.243
<i>You haven't sent me living expenses yet.</i>
<i>Are you just going to abandon your family?</i>

11:43.744 --> 11:46.914
RESTAURANT FOR DRIVERS

12:00.094 --> 12:03.973
Honey, honey! Tae-sik!

12:07.143 --> 12:09.770
You should at least eat!

12:13.441 --> 12:14.692
One bulgogi combo, please.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.819
We have one bulgogi combo.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.911
My gosh.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.831
FROM: MY LOVELY DAUGHTER
PHOTO SENT

12:30.666 --> 12:31.542
VIEW

13:06.577 --> 13:07.912
My gosh.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.083
Are you kidding me?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.925
Why did you upload the photo?

13:21.008 --> 13:22.676
You hate taking pictures with me.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.262
Only to gain more followers.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.889
It's lame, but what can I do?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.477
You don't smoke, right?

13:34.772 --> 13:35.689
I should quit.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.826
Do you actually smoke?

13:48.619 --> 13:50.579
Did you buy that? You're so gullible.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.041
Dad will send me to the States.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.461
I obviously won't get
into the best colleges like you.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.839
He'll send me
to some no-name school there.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.883
-Did you tell him that you'd go?
-I can't disobey him.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.427
Don't go if you don't want to.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.682
Well, I don't really dislike the idea.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.768
My allowance will probably go up
if I move there.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.859
You know what though?
I might not miss Dad,

14:20.651 --> 14:22.236
but I think I'll miss you.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.904
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

15:14.872 --> 15:17.374
Hey, that is so cool.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.126
Gosh, that hurts.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.379
Forget those who act helpful to your face.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.799
Those who help you without your knowledge
are truly nice people.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.721
Did you just hear that?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.264
Hear what?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.433
There's someone behind us.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.520
There's nobody.

15:40.022 --> 15:40.940
I'm scared.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.567
Why are you scared?
No one is following us.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.737
That's why I'm scared.
I heard something, but there's no one.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.322
Here we go again.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.574
Hey, you smell poop
when there's no one?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.576
And cigarette smoke
when you're alone?

15:55.079 --> 15:59.041
You'd better take me seriously.
Be careful on your way home, okay?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.543
What's with you these days?
Gosh, it hurts.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.962
-Come on. Let's go.
-Gosh.

16:03.045 --> 16:07.341
Jesus said he considers those who listen
to and live by God's word his family.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.802
According to his teachings,

16:09.885 --> 16:12.805
we must sacrifice ourselves
in and out of the church

16:12.888 --> 16:15.474
like a grain of wheat
that gladly sacrifices itself.

16:16.266 --> 16:20.479
We must also live the kind of life
where we can nourish our children.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.898
In this day and age,

16:22.982 --> 16:26.318
the tougher things get in life,
the more you need your family

16:26.402 --> 16:28.654
who's there to support you.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.283
With that said, I'd like to introduce
someone who's here.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.747
He lets his faith lead and guide him
every single day.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.835
It's Congressman Do Sang-won.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.591
I'm sure some of you already know.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.387
He's a single dad,
and the government keeps him busy.

16:53.887 --> 16:59.852
But he's raised his two children
to be brilliant and polite.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.540
Thank you very much for your kind words
about my family.

17:22.332 --> 17:26.420
Good luck with the by-election.
I'll be praying for you.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.007
I'm always so grateful for you.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.634
I wouldn't be where I am now
without your prayers.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.511
It is my absolute pleasure.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.266
I heard your son got into
Hankook University. Congratulations.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.728
We owe it all to Buddha's mercy.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.606
The merciful Buddha.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.151
So what is our religion?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.571
What do you think?
Whichever is believed by more people.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.673
Hello, welcome to our shop.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.684
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.195
Hello, welcome to our shop.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.780
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.492
Hey, come here.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.122
Do you think each guest
is getting one of these?

18:43.205 --> 18:46.083
We may be able to get another one
if we take one now.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.794
We're poor students,
but let's not do that, okay?

18:57.928 --> 18:59.304
-This is awesome.
-I know.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.722
Hey, look. Isn't that...

19:01.014 --> 19:02.266
Mi-rae.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.855
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.731
I won tickets to this event.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.197
Oh, this is my friend.
He's our TA.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.283
That cool guy?

19:20.242 --> 19:22.828
-Hello.
-Hello, it's nice to meet you.

19:22.911 --> 19:23.745
Woo-young.

19:34.923 --> 19:39.011
<i>Her doe eyes, perfectly defined nose,</i>
<i>and flawless skin.</i>

19:39.094 --> 19:41.972
<i>She's a perfect natural beauty.</i>

19:43.765 --> 19:44.933
<i>100 out of 100.</i>

19:47.394 --> 19:49.479
<i>I did it again without even realizing it.</i>

19:49.771 --> 19:50.856
Hello.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.566
Welcome.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.613
<i>Could she be...</i>

20:07.623 --> 20:10.709
Oh, she's a freshman at our school.
This is her friend.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.464
This is Ms. Na Hye-sung,
the president of Kelun Korea.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.841
-She's our alumna.
-What?

20:20.510 --> 20:21.678
Hello.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.097
It's nice to meet you.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.309
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.620
-Yes.
<i>-Sir, it's me, Young-mo.</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:47.579
Yes, what's up?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.957
I'm tailing her at the moment.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.333
Hey, hold on.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.504
Yes, go on.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.130
She's at a perfume event.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.133
I looked everywhere
but didn't see Kyung-seok or Kyung-hee.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.137
They're with me now.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.017
Kyung-seok, can I use your phone?
My battery is dead.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.603
Kyung-hee, how did you do
on your midterms?

21:12.020 --> 21:13.522
It hasn't even begun yet.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.651
Have you been studying English hard?

21:19.361 --> 21:20.362
Yes.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.782
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

21:24.533 --> 21:26.743
Wait, give it back for a second.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.794
NA HYE-SUNG APPOINTED
AS PRESIDENT OF HANKOOK KELUN

22:24.551 --> 22:27.929
Will you join a research lab
after completing your master's degree?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.975
That was my plan, but I'm considering
becoming a patent attorney.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.771
Independent labs keep shutting down.
Everything is owned by big companies.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.773
It's okay to keep your options open.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.275
Your heart will lead you
to the right path.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.277
Yes.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.995
Hello.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.166
Thank you.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.046
Thank you.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.258
-I'm a fan.
-Hello. Thank you.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.885
-What's your name?
-Hyun-jung.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.139
TO HYUN-JUNG

23:52.222 --> 23:54.975
It seemed like you knew how to rap.

23:55.058 --> 23:58.728
Pardon? Oh, I like rap music.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.022
Oh, really? That's what's up.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.069
If I send you a mix tape,
would you listen to it?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.155
Yes, of course. I'll have a listen.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.532
-Okay, thank you.
-Thanks.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.098
I heard you won the event ticket.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.726
You must be interested in perfumes.

24:38.685 --> 24:42.105
Yes. My dream is to become a perfumer.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.734
Really? Is that why you decided
to major in chemistry?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.402
Yes.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.363
Really? I majored in chemistry
for the same reason.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.240
Since when?

24:55.911 --> 24:59.956
Ever since I read a magazine
in middle school.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.128
I'd like to thank everyone
for attending today's event.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.174
I'm Lee Soo-hyun,
the director of Kelun Korea.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.219
Your payment is complete.
I'll call you once it's ready.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.261
Okay.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.766
One Americano, please.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.100
-One Americano?
-Sua.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.686
-You can sit down.
-Oh, thank you.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.357
One Americano?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.691
-Yes.
-Okay.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.486
When do you finish?

25:29.569 --> 25:31.488
I still have an hour left.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.406
I have great news.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.492
JARYONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

25:36.326 --> 25:37.410
That's...

25:37.827 --> 25:40.330
<i>It's time</i>
<i>for President Na Hye-sung's speech.</i>

25:45.752 --> 25:48.046
Hello, I'm Na Hye-sung.

25:54.010 --> 25:57.931
I thought about what I should say to you.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.725
And thanks to a young lady I met just now,

26:00.809 --> 26:04.729
I was reminded of what I wrote
in a magazine a long time ago.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.150
"The true beauty of perfume lies
in the fact

26:09.734 --> 26:11.987
that it can't be seen.

26:13.113 --> 26:18.577
<i>Scent is the one and only beautiful thing</i>
<i>that can be felt with your eyes closed.</i>

26:19.578 --> 26:23.707
<i>I believe this intangible beauty will be</i>
<i>somewhat of a consolation</i>

26:24.291 --> 26:27.669
<i>to those who are sick of this world</i>
<i>that only focuses on outer beauty."</i>

26:29.671 --> 26:35.552
I think we are blessed to be able to love
this intangible beauty called scent.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.638
I hope you all enjoy your time.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.559
And thank you so much
for coming to our event.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.862
You did great.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.323
-Hello.
-Welcome.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.824
I really liked your speech.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.952
Ta-da. Isn't this amazing?

27:01.036 --> 27:04.331
Junoflo told me that he'll listen
to my mix tape if I send one.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.751
What's wrong?

27:11.713 --> 27:14.591
That's her.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.385
KANG MI-RAE

27:17.552 --> 27:20.180
Isn't it weird? She's not even
in the group photo.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.098
Is it her?

27:22.682 --> 27:25.685
Maybe she was absent on the day
they took photos.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.813
Don't people normally hand in
another photo?

27:28.897 --> 27:30.065
No one leaves it blank.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.488
I think she used to hate taking photos.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.573
I wonder why.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.242
Maybe she used to look like a monster.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.994
Gosh, come on.

27:47.248 --> 27:51.378
Why don't you just tell her
that you're the one who wrote it?

27:52.253 --> 27:53.922
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

27:55.840 --> 28:00.178
I wrote that I was sick of the world
that only focused on outer beauty,

28:01.262 --> 28:03.723
and that's why I came to like perfumes.

28:03.807 --> 28:07.435
What would she say once she finds out
that I got plastic surgery done?

28:09.771 --> 28:10.605
Mi-rae.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.400
What's your plan for today?

28:13.483 --> 28:15.568
I'd like to treat you to dinner.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.615
I'm sorry. I'm a little busy today.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.494
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry.
I'll see you at school then.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.371
See you next time.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.791
Hey, Woo-young.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.211
I'm sorry for the last time.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.587
What are you talking about?

28:36.131 --> 28:39.759
You tried to help me that night
at the party, but I...

28:40.969 --> 28:45.223
When you spilled water on me?
That's fine. Don't worry about it.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.267
I'll see you guys.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.690
-See you next time.
-I'll see you again at school.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.567
I'm going to go home.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.987
I need to write the lyrics
when I'm inspired.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.949
Okay. You should write
about how I feel as well.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.034
Bye.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.919
I'll see you at work.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.803
I could make a good speech
thanks to you. Thanks.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.390
No, you're the one who wrote it.

29:27.515 --> 29:28.767
That's why I'm grateful.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.603
The first and last time I wrote
anything in a magazine,

29:31.686 --> 29:35.690
but you remembered it until now.
Gosh, I'm so touched.

29:38.610 --> 29:43.156
Would you like to eat dinner with me
if you're free?

29:43.907 --> 29:44.741
Pardon?

29:44.824 --> 29:48.703
Do you feel uncomfortable about it
when we just met today?

29:49.871 --> 29:52.832
No, not at all.
I'd love to.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.084
-Really?
-Yes.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.129
Does the food street
in front of our school still exist?

30:00.089 --> 30:03.218
Our school's surrounded by food streets.

30:07.138 --> 30:10.767
I used to walk here like this.

30:11.142 --> 30:11.976
Why?

30:12.977 --> 30:15.063
Why do you think? Because I was drunk.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.359
Do you drink, Mi-rae?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.654
Just a little.

30:22.737 --> 30:25.281
Then let's skip dinner
and go drink right away.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.951
You can choose where we should go.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.705
I don't know that many bars.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.041
I don't mind going anywhere.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.841
I'm busy, and I'm also really lonely.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.718
I don't have a girlfriend.
Show me some pity.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.346
You need to do this alone
to reduce labor costs.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.016
That's not for you to say.
You get paid a lot.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.561
Just get over here.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.730
Welcome. Is it just you two?

30:57.814 --> 30:58.773
Yes.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.191
Hey.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.360
-Hello.
-Hi.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.403
Please sit down.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.989
-This way.
-Okay.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.748
Where are you going at this hour?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.335
Yoo-jin asked me for help.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.509
I really don't understand that punk.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.137
I'll see you when I get back.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.308
Always be careful of your actions.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.607
Today's event was really incredible.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.526
I've never been to an event like that
in my life.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.951
I can't drink that well yet.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.746
I also want to drink well.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.257
I reread what I had written,

32:06.341 --> 32:09.344
and I realized
that it was just full of bluff.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.973
The trend and some other stuff
that I didn't really mean.

32:15.016 --> 32:19.187
But I came to my senses
as soon as I talked to you.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.190
I realized that I'm just someone
who likes perfumes

32:22.273 --> 32:24.734
more than I am a businesswoman.

32:27.695 --> 32:28.863
Here you go.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.372
I always drink my shots in one go.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.041
This is why they say
it's hard to change old habits.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.001
I think it's great.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.087
I've aged and deteriorated in many ways,

32:45.463 --> 32:48.383
but I'm still good at drinking.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.343
I envy you so much.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.053
Why?

32:54.430 --> 32:56.724
Because you're living your dream.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.611
Being envious...

33:11.489 --> 33:13.116
is also a sad thing.

33:16.869 --> 33:21.290
Being envious of something
that's ordinary, not extraordinary...

33:23.292 --> 33:25.044
is sad.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.469
Hey, you over there.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.556
-I said your face must show.
-Gosh, seriously.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.016
What is her problem?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.727
Her face is.
No wonder she wants to hide it.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.729
It's too hot. I'm getting annoyed.

33:42.854 --> 33:43.813
Hey, Kang Orc.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.190
I'll kill you
if you tell that you like me.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.817
You'd better not tell anyone.

33:57.827 --> 34:02.415
<i>Being envious of something</i>
<i>that's ordinary, not extraordinary...</i>

34:04.250 --> 34:05.877
<i>is sad.</i>

34:35.907 --> 34:36.949
Mi-rae.

34:38.951 --> 34:39.994
Yes.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.295
Mom, I said it's okay.

34:49.378 --> 34:52.255
Come on, it's fine. Give it to me.

34:53.174 --> 34:56.135
Gosh, it's so heavy. Let's go, son.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.019
Hey, you. You got here fast.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.191
Ms. Na.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.319
I have something to tell you.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.536
What are you doing? Get to work already.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.248
Huh?

35:48.312 --> 35:49.772
He's my classmate.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.483
-This is--
-What are you...

35:53.401 --> 35:54.777
doing here?

36:04.203 --> 36:05.580
You've grown up so much.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.967
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help out today.

36:18.759 --> 36:19.677
Hey.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.637
Kyung-seok.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.097
Do Kyung-seok.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.450
I'm his mom.

36:44.744 --> 36:45.661
Pardon me?

36:58.424 --> 36:59.383
Kyung-seok.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.763
See you later.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.735
I'm sorry for leaving like this.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.321
It's okay. Please get home safely.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.658
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.334
-Let go.
-No.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.254
Let go! Let go of me, please.

38:18.337 --> 38:19.922
Let go!

38:20.006 --> 38:24.969
I'm not a flower.
I said, I'm not a flower! Let go.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.556
-Come to your senses, please!
-Let go of me.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.310
Let go!

38:33.936 --> 38:34.854
No.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.232
I told you to let go of me...

38:39.358 --> 38:42.486
Let go. Please let go of me!

39:16.479 --> 39:18.439
This is so nice.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.468
<i>People might seem</i>
<i>like they're living a worry-free life.</i>

39:48.552 --> 39:51.889
<i>But they're all just trying their best</i>
<i>to keep living.</i>

40:22.795 --> 40:23.879
Hi, Mom.

40:26.924 --> 40:27.883
Where's Dad?

40:30.219 --> 40:34.014
Well, just because I miss you two.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.525
<i>Hello?</i>

40:45.151 --> 40:46.152
-Yes?
<i>-What's wrong?</i>

40:46.902 --> 40:48.696
It's nothing.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.451
Don't starve yourself
trying to lose weight.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.120
<i>Okay. I'll call you again soon.</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:58.164
All right, good night.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.837
ONE NEW MESSAGE

41:10.509 --> 41:12.595
5,000,000 WON DEPOSITED
BY KANG TAE-SIK

41:17.766 --> 41:19.185
What on earth is this about?

41:32.698 --> 41:34.658
Hey, it's me, Eun-shim.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.994
Did you talk to Tae-sik today
by any chance?

41:38.204 --> 41:39.205
No?

41:41.207 --> 41:44.585
Gosh, I don't even know.
He hasn't been coming home.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.936
You're here.
Can you take a look at this for me?

42:04.813 --> 42:05.981
Did you talk about it?

42:07.107 --> 42:10.027
What's wrong? Did she not remember?

42:12.655 --> 42:13.697
I didn't tell her.

42:14.281 --> 42:15.115
Why?

42:15.616 --> 42:18.577
We weren't in the right mood
to bring up the subject.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.957
By the way, I heard some noise
on my way back again.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.708
-Again?
-Yes.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.046
It felt like someone was following me.

43:38.490 --> 43:41.577
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
OF JARYONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

44:24.411 --> 44:25.996
SEARCH RESULTS FOR NA HYE-SUNG

44:29.249 --> 44:30.292
PRESIDENT OF KELUN KOREA

44:34.338 --> 44:39.385
SHE WAS DIVORCED FROM THE FORMER
CONGRESSMAN, DO SANG-WON, TEN YEARS AGO.

45:02.658 --> 45:05.160
Your  postures are the same,
but feel totally different.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.414
Forget it.
You'll only get compared to him.

45:45.325 --> 45:46.618
You've grown up so much.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.802
What's going on between them?

46:08.891 --> 46:10.100
Can we talk for a while?

46:15.522 --> 46:17.316
Did you get home safely last night?

46:17.900 --> 46:19.151
How do you know that woman?

46:20.444 --> 46:21.320
<i>That woman?</i>

46:22.362 --> 46:25.449
I met her for the first time
at the perfume event that day.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.455
Our TA was there, too.

46:31.538 --> 46:34.541
He introduced me to her,
saying she was our alumna.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.420
You drink with someone you met
for the first time?

46:40.380 --> 46:41.340
Well...

46:42.424 --> 46:46.720
It happened that way
by accident after the event.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.097
Is that all?

46:49.640 --> 46:50.474
Yes.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.060
She left right after that as well.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.190
Are you okay?

47:02.319 --> 47:03.445
I was worried.

47:04.071 --> 47:07.241
Why would you be?
It's none of your business.

47:10.577 --> 47:11.745
Don't tell others.

47:12.621 --> 47:15.082
I won't. Why would I tell such a thing
to others?

47:15.165 --> 47:19.086
You asked me not to tell that we went
to the same school, but you revealed it.

47:19.586 --> 47:24.967
Well, that's because that was my problem.
It didn't harm you either.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.846
Are you the type
who changes words like that too?

47:32.057 --> 47:33.725
I hate those...

47:36.770 --> 47:38.313
who don't keep their promises.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.448
I also hate those...

47:51.285 --> 47:53.412
who vent their anger on others.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.255
Anyway,

48:04.464 --> 48:06.466
I won't care, so don't worry.

48:48.508 --> 48:51.511
What are you... doing here?

48:59.311 --> 49:00.896
You've grown up so much.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.316
Hi.

49:50.612 --> 49:54.324
Kyung-seok. You know the "exam notes"
passed down from seniors, right?

49:55.575 --> 49:59.037
I have a really helpful one,
different from the others. You want it?

50:00.330 --> 50:01.164
No.

50:02.207 --> 50:03.041
Okay.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.088
Are you leaving?

50:09.965 --> 50:10.924
I need to eat.

50:14.469 --> 50:17.222
That chic personality of his
is getting annoying.

50:20.726 --> 50:21.935
Thank you.

50:33.947 --> 50:36.324
-Finally, exam period is over.
-It's over?

50:36.742 --> 50:39.661
-Did you do well on your tests?
-Of course not.

50:39.745 --> 50:40.871
Let's go eat first.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.290
-Deal.
-But I'm sleepy.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.751
-Come on.
-Let's eat.

50:51.339 --> 50:53.341
PRODUCT NAME: WAX

51:02.184 --> 51:04.227
-This one smells nice.
-It's really nice.

51:05.103 --> 51:06.605
How much will you sell it for?

51:06.688 --> 51:11.068
9,900 won seems a bit cheap,
so I'll make it 10,000 won.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.905
Then how many of them
should you sell a month?

51:15.614 --> 51:20.077
If I work part-time for 4 hours,
it's 30,120 won.

51:20.702 --> 51:22.120
I should sell at least 60.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.873
Do you think you'll be able to?

51:25.415 --> 51:28.043
I'll raise the price for the ones
with a bigger size.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.630
If it's not enough,
I should get another part-time job.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.510
It's 71,600 won.

51:41.848 --> 51:43.892
Oh... Well...

51:45.477 --> 51:48.021
Can't you give us a little discount?

51:48.772 --> 51:51.233
Check the other stores.
Our place is the cheapest.

51:51.316 --> 51:56.029
Still, we came all the way here
instead of buying items online.

51:56.113 --> 51:59.783
Hey, try acting cute. Hurry.

51:59.866 --> 52:00.909
What?

52:01.910 --> 52:04.996
Sir, we plan to sell products,

52:05.080 --> 52:07.290
so we're going to come really often
from now on.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.668
It's the cheapest.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.630
What are you doing?

52:23.181 --> 52:26.434
Please give us a 100 won discount
for each item. Please?

52:35.402 --> 52:36.862
Come on.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.160
Okay, I'll do that.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.414
Thank you.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.921
Oh my gosh.

53:02.095 --> 53:04.389
I actually wanted to do it
once in my life.

53:06.224 --> 53:08.059
"Mister, please give me a discount."

53:09.853 --> 53:10.687
Shut up.

53:10.770 --> 53:14.274
But you told me to act cute.
Aren't I cute?

53:14.858 --> 53:16.443
-Goodness.
-Hey.

53:16.526 --> 53:17.944
Don't do it forever.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.614
I'm telling you.

53:20.989 --> 53:23.533
MS. NA HYE-SUNG

53:29.998 --> 53:31.124
Hello?

53:32.167 --> 53:34.252
Yes, I'm doing great.

53:35.086 --> 53:37.214
I finished my mid-terms.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.055
Pardon?

53:45.138 --> 53:48.016
I know it's a difficult thing to ask,
and I'm sorry.

53:50.060 --> 53:51.394
But please.

53:52.854 --> 53:55.357
What? My goodness.

53:56.191 --> 53:58.818
She's Kyung-seok's mom?

53:59.402 --> 54:00.278
Yes.

54:00.612 --> 54:03.740
I guess
good looks are genetically inherited.

54:05.367 --> 54:08.078
Did his parents get divorced then?

54:10.121 --> 54:13.250
Why doesn't he want to see his mom though?

54:14.751 --> 54:15.919
I don't know.

54:18.004 --> 54:20.257
So what are you going to do?

54:25.303 --> 54:26.513
I'd do it if I were you.

54:27.222 --> 54:30.100
She saved your life,
so what's there you can't do for her?

54:31.393 --> 54:32.936
Don't say that.

54:35.146 --> 54:37.274
It's hard for me to say no to her as well.

54:38.316 --> 54:40.318
So don't say such a thing.

54:40.944 --> 54:44.197
That's right. You're good.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.324
Nice job.

54:48.702 --> 54:49.661
Look.

54:49.744 --> 54:53.790
Fill 20 percent of the glass with foam.
Nice and neat like that.

54:54.165 --> 54:55.208
One more glass?

55:02.090 --> 55:04.676
Glaring like that will only hurt
your eyes.

55:14.936 --> 55:16.563
A glass of water, please.

55:16.646 --> 55:18.148
You already have it.

55:19.232 --> 55:20.233
I mean, warm water.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.402
Do you drink warm water with beer?

55:23.236 --> 55:24.404
That's up to me.

55:27.490 --> 55:29.659
Did you see her
throw a fit at her customer?

55:30.994 --> 55:32.120
Let's just go.

55:36.291 --> 55:39.085
-Do Kyung-seok.
-Huh? Kyung-seok.

55:39.169 --> 55:40.879
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.672
Sit here then.

55:43.089 --> 55:43.923
Hi, Kyung-seok.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.551
Let's sit over there.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.222
Give us two glasses of beer.

55:51.806 --> 55:54.309
Is he trying to avoid me now?

55:55.393 --> 55:57.228
You're making me want to avoid you too.

56:02.150 --> 56:03.109
Thank you.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.710
Why is my business so slow
when the mid-terms are over?

56:21.336 --> 56:23.922
It went all right in the beginning,
but not anymore.

56:24.839 --> 56:27.842
Maybe my father's prayer is working.

56:29.260 --> 56:30.678
Prayer for you to fail?

56:30.762 --> 56:31.846
Don't get me started.

56:31.971 --> 56:35.350
He keeps talking about
"The Return of the Prodigal Son."

56:36.559 --> 56:38.520
He must be waiting for you
with a feast.

56:38.603 --> 56:42.941
I should be the one who prepares the feast
by becoming successful somehow.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.777
But my mother's counting on me.

56:49.114 --> 56:50.824
Oh, Lord, please.

56:52.075 --> 56:54.119
Come on... huh?

56:57.288 --> 56:58.206
It's not my phone.

57:01.376 --> 57:04.129
Check your phone already
if you know you got a message.

57:04.212 --> 57:05.964
It could be from Kyung-hee.

57:11.845 --> 57:12.971
KANG MI-RAE

57:13.179 --> 57:15.390
CAN WE MEET TOMORROW?

57:23.440 --> 57:24.941
Hasn't she contacted you yet?

57:32.991 --> 57:34.325
Let's not talk about it.

57:48.631 --> 57:52.594
GENES OF HANKOOK

57:52.677 --> 57:55.805
FROM MAY 15TH TO 17TH

57:55.930 --> 57:57.515
I hope Twice comes.

57:58.183 --> 58:00.018
Twice.

58:07.233 --> 58:10.403
-Sua.
-Oh, hello.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.114
It is essential
you and Kyung-seok serve at the bar.

58:13.448 --> 58:14.324
What?

58:14.824 --> 58:16.493
-We'll do it too.
-Well, right.

58:16.576 --> 58:19.287
-We might not need your help.
-Right.

58:23.374 --> 58:24.959
Why is it essential for me?

58:26.419 --> 58:28.671
Because you're the face of our campus.

58:30.548 --> 58:33.134
Exactly. I want to help her.

58:33.301 --> 58:34.594
Why would they stop me?

58:36.971 --> 58:39.224
Stop hitting on Sua already.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.935
If you want to copy Kyung-seok,
do it right.

58:42.393 --> 58:43.728
Be chic.

59:00.411 --> 59:01.579
How were your mid-terms?

59:03.164 --> 59:03.998
They were okay.

59:12.340 --> 59:14.300
Would you like to have a drink?

59:43.913 --> 59:47.792
I smiled only once in my middle school
life. It was because of you.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.043
I must be crazy.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.920
There's a beauty among the freshmen?

59:51.004 --> 59:52.422
How about Kang Mi-rae?

59:53.256 --> 59:55.675
Can you help us serve at the bar
during the festival?

59:55.758 --> 59:58.386
What about Mi-rae? She must be in it.

59:58.469 --> 1:00:00.471
She's the goddess of Hankook University.

1:00:00.555 --> 1:00:02.724
<i>Why did she like your picture?</i>

1:00:02.807 --> 1:00:06.561
<i>I thought you didn't know each other</i>
<i>at first because you acted like that.</i>

1:00:06.644 --> 1:00:09.772
<i>-What do you do during the festival?</i>
-The festival? I'm not sure.

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:11.649
<i>I'm a bit busy these days.</i>

1:00:11.774 --> 1:00:13.693
You're the TA of Mi-rae's department.

1:00:13.776 --> 1:00:15.403
How about some beer later today?

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:17.655
<i>It'd be nice if we tell Mi-rae to join us.</i>

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:19.866
We have a good selection of servers.

1:00:19.949 --> 1:00:22.994
Sua is feminine while Mi-rae is sexy.

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:25.038
That woman came back to Korea.

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:27.665
She had an affair
and abandoned her children.

1:00:27.999 --> 1:00:29.876
<i>I know you won't see her.</i>

1:00:29.959 --> 1:00:30.793
Mi-rae.

1:00:30.877 --> 1:00:32.754
Come over at a housewarming party.

1:00:32.837 --> 1:00:34.797
-Didn't you say you were busy?
-Huh?

1:00:34.922 --> 1:00:36.382
When will you hold the party?

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:39.594
Are you really coming?
Or is there someone you like among them?
