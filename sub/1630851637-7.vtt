- I do like that you
experienced with this different

46:45.368 --> 46:47.970
<i>type of silhouette
and shape that's rounded.</i>

46:48.038 --> 46:51.775
My problem lies more
in the skirt and the top.

46:51.842 --> 46:55.011
Somehow I would have liked
to see it a little bit lighter,

46:55.078 --> 46:57.246
<i>to balance the heaviness
of the coat.</i>

46:57.314 --> 46:59.249
<i>You know, I would have liked
to see the legs moving,</i>

46:59.316 --> 47:01.584
and for it to be
a little bit more sharp.

47:01.651 --> 47:05.122
- Where it goes awry for me is

47:05.188 --> 47:07.189
the quilting on the inside.

47:07.191 --> 47:09.859
Inside of a cocoon
is a butterfly.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.727
And it just doesn't feel
butterfly-ish.

47:11.795 --> 47:15.831
- Were you surprised to
find yourself in the bottom?

47:15.899 --> 47:17.466
- Actually, right now
that I was there,

47:17.468 --> 47:19.035
I was telling Kristina,
I don't know.

Both: Thank you.

47:45.629 --> 47:47.164
- Tell us all about this look.

47:47.230 --> 47:49.699
- We wanted to create
different panels,

47:49.766 --> 47:52.034
a more structured dress.

47:52.102 --> 47:55.104
And the reason why a cage
and restraint

47:55.171 --> 47:58.942
is I was tell my society
that I'm a minority,

47:59.008 --> 48:02.044
I'm a woman, and it's like,
I'm in this cage,

48:02.112 --> 48:04.313
and they tell me,
"You cannot succeed."

48:04.381 --> 48:08.118
But if you see inside of us,
we are more than that.

48:08.184 --> 48:10.185

48:12.722 --> 48:15.724
I've been told several times
what I do isn't good enough.

48:15.792 --> 48:19.795

You had me at the headpiece.

I'm feeling headpieces today.

- Yeah, it's horse hair.

48:35.112 --> 48:35.945

it's horse hair and bony.

It's really--it's really cool.

48:41.050 --> 48:42.351

48:42.353 --> 48:44.420
- How was the collaboration
between you guys?

48:44.488 --> 48:47.490
- We just worked well together.
It was like 50/50 all the way.

48:47.557 --> 48:51.827
- What I love about the piece
is there's freedom in it,

48:51.895 --> 48:54.096
but it's structured,
and it's bound.

48:54.098 --> 48:57.367
It's fun and complicated,

48:57.434 --> 49:00.236
which is fierce, honey.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.305

- Oh, you can have it!

49:03.373 --> 49:04.607
- I might not cover my face,

49:04.609 --> 49:07.977
'cause I've worked too long
to get people to know my face.

49:08.044 --> 49:10.946
- This piece was
the most functional,

49:11.014 --> 49:12.715
wearable art that we saw today.

49:12.782 --> 49:16.385

- Aaron, can you tell us about
the inspiration for the look?

50:01.364 --> 50:03.899
- So Bones was thinking
"Game of Thrones."

50:03.967 --> 50:05.267
I was thinking, like,

50:05.269 --> 50:08.037
Arctic bride
walking through the tundra.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.072
And it all just kind of--

50:09.138 --> 50:11.440
Honestly,
it kind of fell in place.

50:11.508 --> 50:14.310
- I like a little bit of drama.

50:14.312 --> 50:17.045
This was one of my
highest scores of the night.

50:17.047 --> 50:19.448

like some Gala
at Lincoln Center or something.

50:29.158 --> 50:31.094
- [chuckles]
- To the opera.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.997
- That's exactly what I got.
- Yes.

50:34.064 --> 50:38.067
- She is the opera.
And she is Maria Callas.

50:38.134 --> 50:39.268
- Yeah.

50:39.335 --> 50:41.204
- And she is giving me
a big costume.

50:41.271 --> 50:43.106
What I'm having a problem with

50:43.172 --> 50:46.608
is that it is less
of an avant-garde idea.

50:46.676 --> 50:49.945
- Could you turn around
for one second for me, honey?

50:50.013 --> 50:52.615
That cut-out, the panels,

<i>the train could have been
longer, for my money.</i>

50:55.954 --> 50:59.354

But so well-executed.

50:59.422 --> 51:01.491

one too many things going on.

51:01.558 --> 51:03.025
Can we see it
without the necklace?

51:03.027 --> 51:04.359
- Yeah.

51:04.427 --> 51:06.161
- That's a perfect example

51:06.229 --> 51:08.630
of when you can edit yourself
a little bit.

51:08.698 --> 51:10.899
That's a beautiful neckline
that I didn't see

51:10.967 --> 51:12.368

everything.

one of our lowest scores.

51:37.426 --> 51:39.995

with the design?

51:40.063 --> 51:41.398
- So we kind of both did.

51:41.464 --> 51:44.701
From the beginning, I did want
to do some puffer stuff.

51:44.767 --> 51:45.868
And, you know,

51:45.870 --> 51:47.537
I wanted to mix a little bit
of my street stuff,

51:47.604 --> 51:50.906

some of her structural stuff.

51:50.974 --> 51:54.743

the last two hours yesterday

- No.

52:16.566 --> 52:17.699

52:17.767 --> 52:20.035
- Because actually, the fabric
was pretty much done.

52:20.037 --> 52:23.906
This is a balloon-shaped skirt
I draped already,

52:23.973 --> 52:25.842
so I used the leftover fabric

52:25.909 --> 52:29.512
that I sewn already to drape
for this bubbling.

52:29.579 --> 52:31.780

because of the execution,

52:31.782 --> 52:34.583
I think it looks a bit sloppy.
- Right.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.785

of the--the skirt and the--?

52:47.198 --> 52:49.531

I did the puffer sleeves.

52:49.599 --> 52:51.600
Anna worked on the bodice.

52:51.668 --> 52:53.535
And I made the headpiece
this morning,

53:34.378 --> 53:36.378

It means, like,
freedom to express yourself

53:38.649 --> 53:40.182
as an artist or designers.

53:40.250 --> 53:43.286

about his streetwear look,

53:43.352 --> 53:44.519
and how he paints it.

53:44.587 --> 53:46.388
I said we have
to incorporate that.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.390
And then I sketched this gown.

53:48.458 --> 53:52.327
And Prajjé said it best:
she's a walking art form.

53:52.395 --> 53:53.796
- Will you tell me
about your point of view?

53:53.863 --> 53:56.598
- For me, growing up in Haiti,
it's art.

53:56.666 --> 53:58.533
The pillars are supposed to be
the strength

53:58.601 --> 54:01.670
that come out of this
art background that we have.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.138

54:03.206 --> 54:05.474
Like, how was the teamwork
between the two of you?

54:05.476 --> 54:06.476

which--

54:06.542 --> 54:07.743
- Yeah.
It was.

54:07.810 --> 54:10.212
I created the pattern
for the sculptures. She builds.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.881

54:12.949 --> 54:14.617

to get to work with her.

54:14.684 --> 54:15.685

54:18.822 --> 54:22.024
It is so elegant,
and so well-done.

54:22.091 --> 54:24.860

full-on couture all the way.

54:40.177 --> 54:44.446
Now, the one issue I have.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.515
She gotta be able to walk

56:06.397 --> 56:07.863
- I completely agree, Billy.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.866
- Avant-garde in fashion
in general is so subjective.

56:10.934 --> 56:12.000
- Yeah.

56:12.068 --> 56:14.002
- And I think that's what makes
picking a winner today

56:14.004 --> 56:15.304

- [chuckles]

56:21.611 --> 56:24.446

I love Prajjé and Chasity

56:24.448 --> 56:26.014
<i>because of the elegance.</i>

56:26.016 --> 56:30.285
I like the juxtaposition a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

56:30.353 --> 56:34.356

56:34.358 --> 56:35.557

56:35.625 --> 56:37.425
<i>- And there's a modernity to it.</i>

56:37.427 --> 56:39.962

56:40.029 --> 56:42.297

more commercial to it.</i>

56:42.365 --> 56:43.599
<i>Both: Yes.</i>

56:43.666 --> 56:47.603
- Whereas
with Chasity and Prajjé,

<i>it's really art in motion...
- Yes.</i>

56:49.705 --> 56:51.239
<i>- Like they said.
- Yes.</i>

56:51.241 --> 56:55.978
- And for me, it's the closest
to an avant-garde design.

56:56.045 --> 56:59.915
- It's really difficult
to do a faux fur gown

56:59.917 --> 57:03.251

57:03.253 --> 57:05.520
- I would have to say
Prajjé and Chasity.

57:05.588 --> 57:07.055
- But Zayden and Coral--

57:07.123 --> 57:09.658
Coral's inspiration
and her message

57:09.725 --> 57:13.996
about feeling put in a cage
by society struck me.

57:14.063 --> 57:17.866
<i>For them to translate
that sense of inferiority</i>

57:17.934 --> 57:20.735
into one of the best looks
that we've seen

57:20.803 --> 57:23.005
in an avant-garde challenge--

57:23.007 --> 57:24.072
- Totally.

57:24.074 --> 57:26.275
- I mean, their work
is really on another level.

57:26.342 --> 57:28.110
- Yes.
- I mean, this artistry,

57:28.112 --> 57:31.947
the macramé, for her to weave
that into this design

57:31.949 --> 57:35.817
and marry it so beautifully
with Zayden's signature touch,

57:35.819 --> 57:40.021
with the buckles--I felt like
they worked so well together

57:40.089 --> 57:44.626
to execute
this really personal message.

57:44.694 --> 57:45.961
- But it's a coat.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.762
So it's easier to do
a faux fur coat...

57:47.830 --> 57:49.431
- Now, we're getting--
- And make it look--

57:49.433 --> 57:50.632
- That's true.

57:50.700 --> 57:51.833
- Now we're getting down
to the nitty gritty.

57:51.835 --> 57:53.501
- And with that said,
the four of them are winners.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.538
I mean, they did
an incredible job.

So it's between Shantall,
Anna, and Octavio.

- Yes.

58:40.149 --> 58:43.151
that this was a bad day.
