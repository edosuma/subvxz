WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.795
-Just how dirty are you?
-He suckered me good.

00:03.878 --> 00:06.840
That president's man, Parker?
He just called in.

00:06.923 --> 00:08.466
ESTERHAUS: You were right, Francis.
They canceled it.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.969
I'm not asking you
to go in there and lie for me.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.846
That's exactly what
you're asking me to do.

00:12.929 --> 00:15.015
This source of yours

00:15.098 --> 00:17.267
-who told you about LaRue...
-He's dead.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.518
We're under siege.

00:18.601 --> 00:19.894
LAMONICA: They're coming in!

00:19.978 --> 00:21.563
No one locked the door?

00:21.646 --> 00:23.273
Oh, please, hold me.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.609
ESTERHAUS: <i>Item nine.</i>

00:27.610 --> 00:31.948
Item nine is a communiquÃ©
from the Hasidic Protection League...

00:32.032 --> 00:35.410
concerning recent acts of vandalism...

00:35.493 --> 00:38.038
at the King David Home
for the Jewish Aged.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.498
(all chattering)

00:40.582 --> 00:45.128
Keep in mind the aforementioned Hasidics
are heavily armed,

00:45.795 --> 00:47.756
patrolling on and around the area,

00:48.506 --> 00:50.091
and are within their rights...

00:50.175 --> 00:53.595
as long as they don't brandish
or step onto public areas, per se.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.181
-Item 10...
-MAN: The British Rabbi Renko

00:56.264 --> 00:57.640
-takes charge.
-...concerns a directive

00:57.724 --> 01:00.935
-from Divisional Commander Swanson...
-WOMAN: Bless you, my son.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.021
(sarcastic exclaiming)

01:03.104 --> 01:04.606
...regarding...

01:05.857 --> 01:09.235
the boarding of canine mascots

01:09.319 --> 01:11.571
by the officers of this precinct.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.573
WOMAN: About time. And that means you.

01:13.656 --> 01:17.660
Now, said officers will either
get rid of said alleged mascots

01:17.744 --> 01:22.916
or be subject to disciplinary action
and possible suspension.

01:22.999 --> 01:23.958
(clapping, booing)

01:24.042 --> 01:25.919
-Get rid of the dog.
-Get rid of the dog.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.589
(booing continues)

01:29.672 --> 01:32.801
The last item on the agenda...

01:32.884 --> 01:37.055
The last item on the agenda
is Operation Duckling.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.058
Now, a complete list of those involved...

01:40.767 --> 01:43.311
will be posted upstairs by the front desk.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.190
Now, keep in mind
this particular assignment

01:47.273 --> 01:49.275
-is no laughing matter.
-Uh-oh.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.695
In fact, I wish I could be
out there with you on this one.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.449
Those officers participating
in Operation Duckling

01:56.533 --> 01:58.576
will reconvene here in one half hour.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.621
And those on regular patrol, let's roll.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.999
All of you,
let's be careful out there, huh?

02:05.083 --> 02:08.044
-(chattering)
-(quacking)

02:09.254 --> 02:10.755
(dog barks)

02:13.091 --> 02:15.927
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

02:16.010 --> 02:17.720
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

02:17.804 --> 02:21.474
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:23.268
(theme music playing)

03:29.375 --> 03:32.295
Macafee's dirty. He's gotta be.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.048
But I'll be damned if I know
where he does his laundry.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.884
We've had cops on close
surveillance 24 hours a day,

03:37.967 --> 03:41.721
and he doesn't gamble,
he's not a womanizer,

03:41.804 --> 03:44.557
he's got no debts,
he's not into the shylocks.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.684
The dude doesn't even own his own car.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.229
-Bank accounts then?
-We checked that out yesterday.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.814
He's got a joint checking with the wife.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.234
Nothing heavy.
And a modest savings account.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.319
I even called in a favor
from a friend of mine

03:56.402 --> 03:57.737
who's into garbology.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.239
What?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.282
He's a garbologist.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.577
A P.I. who specializes in trash analysis.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.664
He went through Macafee's garbage
and didn't find a thing.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.833
In other words,
you're asking us to believe

04:10.917 --> 04:13.044
that Ralph Macafee
is importantly on the take,

04:13.127 --> 04:15.672
yet there's absolutely no trace
of what he does with it.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.841
The man doesn't even have
a safe deposit box.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.223
Miss Davenport was kind enough to steer
Officer LaRue's case my way,

04:25.306 --> 04:27.183
but I'm no Houdini, gentlemen.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.435
I can't help the man
if I have nothing to work with.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.979
Maybe if we get into his house--

04:31.062 --> 04:33.690
You have absolutely
no grounds for a warrant.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.775
Besides, what's the point?

04:35.858 --> 04:38.486
What are you gonna find?
Rembrandts on the walls?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.405
Bruce.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.533
Why don't you try for a delay?

04:44.325 --> 04:46.786
I can talk to Skip Fitzgerald
in the D.A.'s office.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.871
-He owes me one.
-I don't know.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.000
J.D.'s pretty strung out, ma'am.
I'm not so sure that's such a hot idea.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.794
Why don't you people come
to some kind of consensus with LaRue

04:54.877 --> 04:57.630
and then get back in touch with me?
I'm running late as it is.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.633
Joyce, educate them.
Nothing personal, you two.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.970
Pleased with himself, isn't he?
Is he the best we can do?

05:04.053 --> 05:07.015
Don't underestimate him. He's good.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.102
And LaRue's isn't exactly
what I'd call a glamour case.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.688
Stay on him, Neal.
I'll see what I can do from this end.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.648
-Right.
-Uh...

05:17.191 --> 05:20.320
Meet me outside Macafee's house at 11:00.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.529
What could hurt?

05:22.196 --> 05:24.907
(mocking tone)
"Absolutely no grounds for a warrant."

05:25.825 --> 05:29.787
LaRue might want to plead
diminished capacity. He drinks.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.582
Suppose he was under
the influence at the time.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.500
We could work with an approach like that.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.419
Sounds trendy enough, Counselor.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.506
Old Skip Fitzgerald have
a weakness for that, does he?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.385
I shouldn't even be here, Frank.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.598
But as long as I am,
at your request, I might add...

05:48.681 --> 05:50.350
I suggest you start being

05:50.433 --> 05:52.977
a little more realistic
about John LaRue's future.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.730
I've got a reminder for you, Counselor.

05:56.272 --> 05:59.150
John LaRue is not just one
of your indigent types.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.611
A fast shuffle with
good old Skip Fitzgerald...

06:01.694 --> 06:03.988
You've got some interesting
problems with perspective.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.740
...a deal is struck,
and on to the next case.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.116
He's innocent.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.160
He's also a cop, a damn good one.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.454
The issue here
is not John LaRue's innocence or guilt.

06:11.537 --> 06:16.000
The issue is how best to preserve
what is already dangerously tainted bacon.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.341
There is fire in that woman.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.594
Yeah. I noticed that myself.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.353
WOMAN: Hill Street Station. Ah, hold on.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.397
Do we have anyone who can speak Spanish?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.904
Hey, you, mister. Can I help you?

06:45.988 --> 06:49.075
It's me, hair ball... Belker.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.326
No!

06:51.285 --> 06:55.623
Holy smokes!
Belker, you look absolutely gorgeous.

06:55.706 --> 06:59.085
Look at that hairdo.
What'd you do, blow the hairs dry?

06:59.168 --> 07:03.005
(chuckles) And that face...
smooth as baby buns. (laughs)

07:03.673 --> 07:06.551
-Could I ask you a personal question, Leo?
-Yeah.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.594
Would you like a ruptured spleen?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.096
Ah... no.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.934
Oh, yes. That's a good-looking
ensemble, Mick.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.853
Understated elegance,

07:16.936 --> 07:20.523
with just the most careful
dash of color in the tie.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.484
-Well thought out.
-Thank you.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.320
Oh, since you're assigned
to Operation Duckling,

07:26.404 --> 07:29.198
I suggest you head for the locker room
with all due haste.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.535
Operation Duckling. Me? (laughs)

07:36.372 --> 07:37.540
Could I, uh...

07:41.711 --> 07:43.045
Look, Sarge,

07:44.630 --> 07:46.466
I got a date tonight with a woman.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.009
She's picking me up at 6:00.

07:48.092 --> 07:51.471
-Shift ends at 5:00. What's the problem?
-Don't give me "the shift ends at 5:00."

07:51.554 --> 07:54.640
This kind of undercover operation
is over when it's over.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.936
(Imitating W.C. Fields)
Ah, yes. The vicissitudes of police work.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.105
Belker, I empathize.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.358
(sighs)

08:08.029 --> 08:11.073
-MAN: I need some help over here.
-MAN 2: I need some help over here.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.034
I don't know how
to work one of these things.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.412
-MAN 1: What is this?
-This is ridiculous.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.167
-Bobby, go like this.
-Ah, I don't believe this.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.588
-I joined the police force for this?
-Hey!

08:26.506 --> 08:29.133
Somebody wanna get a crow bar
and help me get out of this?

08:29.217 --> 08:30.510
I can't breathe.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.346
(laughing, hooting)

08:33.429 --> 08:36.974
-(wolf whistles)
-BATES: Take this.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.021
Cowboy, you better cover me.
Otherwise, your behind is mine.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.525
That some kind of ghetto threat?
Like, "I'm gonna steal your rib sauce"?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.276
What do you think?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.071
You gonna do something
about those armpits, Cosmo?

08:50.154 --> 08:52.114
Looks like you're nursing
a squirrel under each arm.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.368
Hmm, nicely done, nicely done.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.994
That cigar is a nice touch,

08:57.078 --> 08:59.872
but I think we got to lose
that mustache, Fido.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.875
Nobody touches my upper lip.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.836
They're requesting crisis
intervention assistance.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.421
See if you can raise Goldblume.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.301
-No, wait. He's here. Henry?
-Uh-huh.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.179
Got a jumper on Hobart Street.
I think you'll wanna get over there.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.015
-Who's there now?
-Four units from Jefferson Heights.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.644
Just let me get rid of Shep's lunch,
and I am on my way.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.938
1429.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.235
-Henry, how goes the war?
-Morning, Leo. Listen, I got an emergency.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.279
Would you take this stuff
off my hands, please?

09:31.362 --> 09:34.824
-For Shep, huh?
-Yeah. Uh, one feeding a day.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.911
Three cups, mixed in with enough hot water
to form a delectable gravy.

09:38.995 --> 09:39.996
Got you.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.087
In half a dozen instances,
this guy's used Mace to stun his victims.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.840
He's fast and he's strong, so be alert.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.096
Be sure to cruise
the isolated areas of the park.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.141
Backups,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.144
your more attractive decoys...

10:07.648 --> 10:09.984
will undoubtedly be harassed. Be patient.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.737
Don't move in
unless you're absolutely sure

10:12.820 --> 10:14.113
something's coming down.

10:15.406 --> 10:19.118
Uh, Ray Calletano here
will be your ramrod in this operation.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.954
He'll be monitoring your wires
on the field radio,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.539
along with Alf Chesley.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.334
All right?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.922
(hacking cough)

10:33.215 --> 10:36.302
(coughing continues)

10:36.385 --> 10:38.262
Fay, how are you?

10:39.096 --> 10:42.808
I'm fine, Phil.
Hey, do you know where, um, Frank is?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.393
(coughing continues)

10:44.477 --> 10:46.729
-Are you all right?
-Sure.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.483
I just have to work out the plans
for Frank Jr.'s weekend.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.486
Oh, he's busy downstairs,
but he should be up in a few minutes.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.989
Can I fix you a cup
of freshly brewed coffee?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.492
That's the best offer
I've had all morning.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.370
I don't believe that for one minute, Fay.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.294
Mmm. That's good, Phil.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.881
Mm-hmm.
It's a blend of Colombian and Venezuelan.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.174
FAY: Mmm.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.471
-All is well?
-Sure.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.724
Well, as well as can
be expected, you know.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.310
-Yourself?
-Oh, good. Very good.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.897
How about that young friend of yours?

11:29.980 --> 11:31.857
Cindy? Oh, terrific.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.859
Things couldn't be better between us.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.030
Uh, actually, Fay,

11:40.116 --> 11:42.410
can I be perfectly blunt with you?

11:42.993 --> 11:43.994
Of course.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.082
-I mean, you're an older woman.
-That's perfectly blunt.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.168
(chuckles) No, I mean mature.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.005
Well... You know, as they say,
you have been around the park.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.007
Phil, what are you trying to get at?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.301
Well, I have this problem.

12:01.429 --> 12:05.099
It's of a male-female nature,
if you know what I mean.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.267
Hmm.

12:07.518 --> 12:11.772
If you're talking about
an occasional dysfunction,

12:12.606 --> 12:14.608
there's nothing to worry about,

12:14.692 --> 12:18.487
especially with someone like Cindy,
where you're under pressure to perform.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.949
No, no, no. My relationship with Cindy
is more domestic.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.368
We do a lot of cooking together.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.496
Then the problem's not sex?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.541
My problem is that I met this other woman.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.212
-She's a lot older than Cindy.
-Well, most of us are.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.590
But in spite of her age,

12:37.673 --> 12:42.428
oh, she has an insatiable
appetite... for life.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.808
Phil, don't you know most women
don't even reach their sexual prime

12:47.892 --> 12:49.602
till they're in their late 30s?

12:50.728 --> 12:53.355
Look, if you find this too embarrassing,
I understand.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.065
Hey, I'm not embarrassed.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.320
You know, I've always
been monogamous by nature, but...

12:59.945 --> 13:01.155
this other woman...

13:01.238 --> 13:03.199
Wow! (chuckling)

13:03.282 --> 13:07.703
I'm a sophisticated man, Fay,
but Grace Gardner is something else.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.413
You wouldn't believe

13:09.497 --> 13:12.208
the collection of exotic creams
this woman has.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.501
Grace Gardner?

13:13.584 --> 13:14.919
Sam Gardner's widow?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.378
You know her?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.798
Oh, forget I said anything.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.133
-I don't know what came over me.
-Hey. No, please.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.511
Don't worry about it. Who am I gonna tell?

13:24.512 --> 13:25.846
Grace Gardner?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.225
Yes. She's a remarkable woman.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.103
Energy, talent, college education.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.024
Wonderful muscle tone. Mmm.

13:37.107 --> 13:42.321
Oh! Phil Esterhaus, you sly dog!

13:43.155 --> 13:46.617
You mean to tell me you've got
two adoring women on your hands?

13:48.285 --> 13:49.787
You must be exhausted.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.873
Well, I could use a nap.

13:58.045 --> 14:01.090
Makes you wonder
what Sam died prematurely of.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.342
WOMAN: Oh, check it out.

14:03.425 --> 14:07.388
WOMAN 2: Oh! Hey, can I borrow that dress?

14:07.471 --> 14:11.976
(woman continues, indistinct)

14:12.059 --> 14:13.269
Oh.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.816
-Does your mother know you're out?
-Whoa!

14:20.276 --> 14:22.736
-Oh, man, will you look at this?
-What'd you hit him with?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.029
Say, back off!

14:24.113 --> 14:26.782
Hey, what'd you hit him with, man?
Look at this.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.370
It slipped my mind.
Is he still breathing?

14:31.453 --> 14:34.456
That'll teach you to mess
with my main squeeze, you animal.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.625
-You get away from him!
-Hey, back off!

14:36.709 --> 14:40.045
You damn hussies, get out of my way.
Just step by when I go by.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.672
You book them all. Book them all!

14:42.965 --> 14:44.466
(laughing)

14:46.260 --> 14:48.304
But it's an emergency.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.055
My car is in the shop,

14:50.139 --> 14:53.601
and I am going to lose my job
if I don't get there.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.727
Now, I have the money.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.689
Policy requires a thousand-dollar deposit.
Look, I'm sorry, lady.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.649
I know it's unfair
to people like yourself,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.943
but individuals have been known
to skip with a car.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.696
She's not gonna skip with the car, Rob.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.907
I can't rent you a car without
a bank credit card, lady.

15:07.990 --> 15:08.866
I'm very sorry.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.659
Well, you tell me then...

15:10.743 --> 15:12.786
How am I going to get to work?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.747
Uh, Les?

15:15.331 --> 15:18.250
See if you can call a cab
for this lady here.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.920
That's a 20-mile ride!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.088
I can't pay that just to get there.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.841
Lady, look, I'm sorry. Policy is policy.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.137
Come on, man. Ease up.
You are the company.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.431
She's not gonna steal your lousy car.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.476
-You ease up, J.D.
-Hey, how about it, Rob?

15:35.559 --> 15:37.937
Take a look at her, for God's sake.
She's okay.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.313
-I don't know that.
-I do.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.856
-You do, do you, huh?
-Yeah.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.566
Oh, you know such a lot.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.777
You're such an excellent
judge of character.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.196
Your life's unfolding
like a bad umbrella...

15:47.279 --> 15:50.115
(scoffs) Because you read people so well.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.116
Big-hearted guy.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.535
You don't run a successful
business on heart, kiddo.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.454
All right. I'll tell you what.
I'll rent the car.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.331
She skips out on you,
I'll make good on it.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.540
You'll make good on it?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.876
You can't even make good
on the shape of your head.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.919
Look at you.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.922
You don't have a nickel to your name.
You're in hock up to your eyes.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.758
You blow in here at 10:00 in the morning
stinking of booze.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.760
And the only reason I haven't
canned your act up till now

16:09.843 --> 16:11.637
is your sister'd kill me.
(mimics female voice)

16:11.720 --> 16:13.097
"Oh, he's having a difficult time.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.932
It's a difficult period.
He'll come out of it."

16:15.015 --> 16:17.351
-Sure. The hell you will!
-Take your stinking charity

16:17.434 --> 16:20.562
and shove it in your exhaust pipe,
kiddo, because I've had it!

16:20.646 --> 16:22.398
-I quit!
-Come on, man. Let's go.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.942
-You don't have to hold me. I'm okay.
-Be cool. Be cool.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.070
WASHINGTON: Hey, look, it ain't worth it.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.073
Don't let the chump get to you.
That's all he wants to do.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.741
Come on, baby. Come on. Hey, look here.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.410
Here, man, take this here.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.620
Now, pay your rent,
get outta town for a couple of days,

16:36.704 --> 16:37.538
go fishing.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.331
-I can't take your money.
-Yeah, sure you can.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.249
You'll pay me back.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.876
I can't handle it. I'm busting up inside.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.462
-My nerves. I wanna hit him so bad.
-Uh-uh-uh-uh!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.840
Hey, look, J.D. You got to handle it, man.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.552
Now, I can't make this case on Macafee
and scrape you off the wall too, you know?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.763
Okay. Okay, I'm cool.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.056
Are you sure, babe?

16:57.182 --> 17:00.102
-Yeah, yeah. Go on. I'll be all right.
-Okay.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.228
Later.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.484
(siren wailing)

17:07.568 --> 17:10.904
(upbeat music playing)

17:32.384 --> 17:36.764
That's his I.D. from his wallet.
Name of Martin Hobbs.

17:36.847 --> 17:37.973
Twenty years old.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.100
So what happened?

17:41.101 --> 17:45.189
Well, he stood on the top floor over there
for maybe ten minutes after we got here,

17:45.814 --> 17:47.024
then he jumped.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.068
Look, don't stand in their way.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
There was no way to talk him down?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.655
No. No way.
There was too much crowd noise.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.825
Your usual crud came out of the woodwork.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.244
That's his sister over there.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.539
Name of Jonetta Burns, Mrs.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.294
-Thank you.
-OFFICER: Stay away from the body.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.755
-I don't care.
-WOMAN: She's a friend of mine.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.425
Excuse me, Mrs. Burns.
Detective Goldblume.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.310
This young man was your brother?

18:24.436 --> 18:25.646
Martin.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.525
Did Martin live here with you?

18:30.400 --> 18:31.610
Yeah, he did.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.409
Do you have any idea what might have, uh,
caused him to do this?

18:48.085 --> 18:51.755
They turned him down
at mechanics vocational school.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.298
He couldn't get no job.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.014
Do you know if he was
using drugs of any kind?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.141
No.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.935
He never used any drugs.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.605
He took good care of his body.
He was an athlete.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.942
He didn't smoke or drink or nothing.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.155
Maybe, every once in a while,
he'd smoke with his friends.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.035
MAN: Coming through.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.415
But then, you know,
his girl broke up with him,

19:26.498 --> 19:27.833
and that really hurt him.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.544
And the babies.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.671
I got three little ones at home,

19:34.089 --> 19:35.966
and they're crying all the time.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.261
And he could hardly
take care of his own self,

19:39.344 --> 19:40.721
let alone theirs.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.267
Going up on that roof...

19:46.602 --> 19:49.396
All he wanted to do was...
just do something.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.898
You know, make some money.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.818
All these people out here...

19:55.986 --> 19:57.905
One of them yelled up at him, "Jump.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.241
Jump. Don't jive us, man. Do it."

20:03.410 --> 20:07.206
-(zipper zipping)
-What's the matter with people anymore?

20:10.292 --> 20:13.128
Well... (clears throat)

20:14.588 --> 20:16.673
Boy, I wish I knew, ma'am.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.953
(sighs)

20:56.171 --> 20:58.257
-(tire pops)
-Damn it!

20:59.049 --> 21:00.592
(honking)

21:07.933 --> 21:11.603
(R&amp;B song plays on radio)

21:11.687 --> 21:13.146
MAN: Ooh!

21:14.189 --> 21:15.232
Hey.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.696
A flat, man? (laughs)

21:20.779 --> 21:23.532
MAN: You have a problem, huh?
What's happening, neighbor?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.534
What are you doing around here? Huh?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.662
-He's a traveling salesman.
-I got a flat tire.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.665
-Oh, flat tire.
-A flat tire.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.584
-A real pain in the butt.
-That's damn bad!

21:35.335 --> 21:37.212
(men laughing)

21:37.296 --> 21:40.507
He must be a traveling salesman
of pinstripe and gabardines.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.969
-(laughing)
-Brother's all right.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.388
-Hey, you need some help, man?
-No, thank you.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.850
-I think I got it.
-(mock cheering)

21:49.933 --> 21:52.144
-Give the man a hand.
-Check this out, man.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.396
-Come on. Check it out.
-What's he got in the trunk?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.315
MAN: Ooh-whee!

21:57.065 --> 21:59.985
Hey, look at this.
Say, is this cat unbelievable?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.283
MAN: I like that.
I really like that. (laughing)

22:06.366 --> 22:08.910
MAN 2: Santa Claus in the ghetto.
(laughing)

22:12.456 --> 22:14.624
Okay, who's got the jack?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.168
-Who's Jack?
-Jack? You seen a jack?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.170
I didn't see no jack, man.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.340
-This it?
-Oh, that jack!

22:23.050 --> 22:24.634
This your jack, Jack?

22:27.054 --> 22:30.640
-It's not that easy, Jack.
-(laughs loudly)

22:30.724 --> 22:32.059
All right.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.102
Yeah. I could probably use
the lug wrench too.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.271
MAN: Probably could use the lug wrench.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.774
-(men laughing)
-MAN: Ooh.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.359
Okay, okay.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.820
-Okay, fellas. Give me the tools.
-MAN: Uh-oh. He's serious.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.740
What are you doing
up here anyway, gray meat?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.325
MAN: You take a wrong turn?

22:48.408 --> 22:49.576
Just passing through, son,

22:49.659 --> 22:51.787
and I'm definitely not
looking for any trouble.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.456
But trouble may be looking for you, son.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.458
-Mmm. Tell him!
-Look, guys.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.127
Give me the tools back,
I'll fix my tire, and I'll be on my way.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.838
-Hey, check the radios in there, man.
-Don't touch that radio!

23:01.922 --> 23:04.800
-How much you holding, gray meat?
-Okay. Damn it, that's enough.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.218
Come back here with that!

23:06.301 --> 23:08.720
You didn't answer my question, gray meat.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.473
You on a toll road, man.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.308
Breaker, breaker, gray meat.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.560
Mmm. Mmm.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.731
MAN: Yeah. You didn't think
about this, did you?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.693
What you gonna do now, huh, son?

23:23.777 --> 23:25.654
-What I got is this gun!
-MAN: Cool, man.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.823
Detective Henry Goldblume,
Hill Street Station.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.326
And if you're looking for trouble, son,

23:31.410 --> 23:33.829
congratulations, you just found it.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.914
MAN: Say, brother.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.798
-MAN: The man's getting in.
-(engine cranking)

23:44.881 --> 23:47.050
MAN 2: He ain't gon--
He ain't gonna use that gun.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.469
-He ain't gonna do--
-MAN 3: Call me a chump, sucker?

23:49.553 --> 23:52.431
Why don't you shoot?
You ain't gonna shoot nobody. Chump!

23:52.514 --> 23:56.226
RENKO (on radio):<i> You know, I got about</i>
<i>a half a dozen degenerate conga players</i>

23:56.309 --> 23:59.479
<i>sitting up there on Hippie Hill</i>
<i>smoking illegal herbs and spices.</i>

23:59.563 --> 24:01.982
<i>-I'd like to jump up and down on it.</i>
-Hey, Ray.

24:02.065 --> 24:06.278
Officer Briese just checked in
to Emergency with a twisted ankle.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.947
I warned him those spiked heels
were treacherous.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.241
(laughing)

24:21.126 --> 24:24.296
It's the big gray one, Captain.
They've lived here 12 years.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.131
It ain't exactly the Heights, you know?

24:26.214 --> 24:28.216
Maybe they got Rembrandts on the walls.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.720
(knocking)

24:31.803 --> 24:34.139
-Yes?
-Maureen.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.308
Frank Furillo.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.935
Is everything all right with Ralph?

24:40.103 --> 24:41.646
Of course it is.

24:41.730 --> 24:45.567
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-That knock on the door, it's...

24:45.650 --> 24:47.694
It's like the phone call
in the middle of the night.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.237
Come on in, Frank.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.700
This is Detective Neal Washington.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.327
-How do you do?
-Ma'am. Fine, thank you.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.788
I really am sorry if I frightened you.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.792
I needed a word with Ralph,
and I was in the neighborhood.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.836
Oh, he's out with Eugene.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.379
They're buying a motorbike.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.131
Eugene.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.967
How old is he now?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.260
Sixteen.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.097
They're going partners
with the money Eugene has earned.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.225
You can guess who's gonna do the riding.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.436
FURILLO: They grow up fast.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.898
Oh, I, um...

25:24.981 --> 25:27.150
I was sorry to hear that you and...

25:27.234 --> 25:30.362
-Fay.
-...Fay were divorced.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.908
-I'm really very sorry, Frank.
-Well, it happens.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.660
Police work.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.037
It's very hard on a marriage.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.665
FURILLO: You and Ralph seem
to have done all right.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.125
MAUREEN: Eighteen years, five kids.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.711
I guess we were luckier than most.

25:58.306 --> 26:01.017
What the hell's scaring my wife
half to death all about?

26:01.601 --> 26:03.562
You ever hear of knocking, Macafee?

26:03.645 --> 26:07.190
You got something to say,
you say it to me, Frank, direct!

26:07.274 --> 26:09.859
You leave my wife and kid out of it.
Do you hear me?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.779
-(yelling) Do you hear me?
-Outside.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.282
That direct enough for you?

26:16.992 --> 26:19.369
I'd like to meet you off-precinct, Frank.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.539
Anywhere, anytime.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.834
Just make an appointment.
That's all it takes.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.302
I got a bad temper, Frank.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.804
This whole business with LaRue...

26:38.346 --> 26:39.764
I don't relish it,

26:39.848 --> 26:43.101
especially you protecting
your own at my expense.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.895
You weren't there.
You don't know what came down.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.232
He sold you a bill of goods.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.110
See you in court, Macafee.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.033
We used to know each other, Frank.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.702
More's the pity.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.084
WOMAN: Hill Street Station.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.845
-I got your number too, sunburn.
-Oh, yeah?

27:18.928 --> 27:21.389
Well, I don't have yours yet, Sergeant,

27:21.473 --> 27:24.601
but you better believe
I'm gonna stay on the line till I get it.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.186
If you don't get off my back,

27:26.936 --> 27:28.897
you're gonna be one dead cop.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.775
(shouting, indistinct)

27:42.744 --> 27:45.580
(suspenseful music playing)

27:46.790 --> 27:50.710
(chattering)

27:59.469 --> 28:00.637
Hey, Henry.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.765
MAN: Hill Street Station.
Go ahead, please.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.102
That's it. That is bloody it!

28:07.185 --> 28:08.311
All right!

28:09.187 --> 28:10.647
Whoever you are,

28:10.730 --> 28:12.023
you know who you are,

28:13.066 --> 28:15.151
this bottle has my name on it.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.987
I paid for this orange juice
out of my own pocket

28:18.071 --> 28:20.740
with the expressed intention
of drinking it myself.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.618
You know, I don't mind sharing.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.704
In fact, I enjoy sharing.

28:25.787 --> 28:29.833
But I am sick and tired
of people taking food out of my mouth

28:29.916 --> 28:32.210
without any consideration for me

28:32.293 --> 28:35.088
or any sense of what is right
or what people have to consider

28:35.171 --> 28:37.882
if they're gonna live together
like human beings!

28:37.966 --> 28:39.008
Henry.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.011
Don't "Henry" me, Frank,
because I'm sick of it.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.264
And I don't care.
I do not care, Frank. I don't care.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.058
I mean, if they wanna kill each other,
let them, because I don't care anymore.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.394
If they wanna live like animals, go ahead.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.229
Come on in. We'll talk about it.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.732
-There's nothing to talk about. I'm fine.
-(phone rings)

28:53.815 --> 28:56.151
WOMAN: Hill Street.
Can you hang on a second?

28:59.571 --> 29:01.322
Just stay away from what is mine.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.325
That includes my sandwiches,
my orange juice and me.

29:07.954 --> 29:08.997
(door closes)

29:10.957 --> 29:12.792
WOMAN: I've never seen him like that.

29:21.718 --> 29:24.929
Sometimes I wonder if Henry
isn't in the wrong business.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.266
I think we all wonder that, Francis.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.107
But the great, big, grand...

29:37.776 --> 29:40.028
first-prize-winning question is,

29:41.279 --> 29:43.698
was the big crisis interventionist

29:44.282 --> 29:47.494
scared enough to use
this fine psychological weapon here?

29:50.914 --> 29:54.000
-You bet. You bloody bet he was.
-(gun slams into metal locker)

29:54.083 --> 29:56.586
-Don't be so hard on yourself, Henry.
-Oh, yeah?

29:56.669 --> 29:59.172
In 12 years, I never so much
as unsnapped my holster.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.551
Before Frank found out,
I never even used to load it.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.929
Lighter that way.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.600
-I swore when I signed on--
-We all swore a lot of things, Henry.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.936
What is the matter with those people, Alf?

30:13.728 --> 30:15.313
Are we past fixing it up between us?

30:15.396 --> 30:18.441
Because if that's the way it is, I mean,
what the hell is the sense?

30:19.108 --> 30:21.152
Alf, I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.489
So what's the worst of it then?

30:25.156 --> 30:28.868
Them scaring the hell out of you,
or you getting your feelings hurt?

30:30.578 --> 30:33.248
What's the difference? It's over.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.918
Mostly, I think they hurt your feelings.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.922
You figure you're owed something...

30:41.506 --> 30:44.801
for all that love and compassion...

30:44.884 --> 30:46.052
you carry in you.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.720
Alf, I understand
what you're trying to do,

30:47.804 --> 30:51.057
and I appreciate that very much,

30:51.140 --> 30:53.059
but right now I'd like to be alone,
if you don't mind.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.727
-Okay, Henry.
-Alf.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.650
Thank you.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.735
I mean that.

31:03.319 --> 31:06.364
They had no way of knowing
what you are, Henry.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.410
And if they did, I suspect
it wouldn't have mattered.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.205
So you put that gun back in your belt
and leave it there...

31:14.956 --> 31:17.333
until that big miracle happens.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.795
I've never been to a Jewish funeral.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.089
I don't wanna start with yours.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.257
Hang in.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.600
Hey, I don't believe I caught your name.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.021
Two things, Captain,
and then I'll get out of your hair.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.691
On my way out of here this morning,
while awaiting a change of light

31:41.774 --> 31:44.027
at the corner of Dekker Avenue
and People's Parkway,

31:44.110 --> 31:47.614
a gang of Puerto Ricans
ripped off my hubcaps.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.617
I mean, in broad daylight,
while I was in the car!

31:50.700 --> 31:54.245
-Boy, does that gall me!
-Do you wanna file a complaint?

31:54.329 --> 31:56.539
What do you think I'm doing now,
hyperventilating?

31:57.123 --> 32:02.253
Phil, would you get me a 4-16 form
for Mr. Warnick here?

32:07.425 --> 32:09.677
Now, as far as LaRue is concerned,

32:09.761 --> 32:10.803
timing-wise,

32:10.887 --> 32:13.056
I think we might be able
to finesse his situation

32:13.139 --> 32:16.142
with Skip Fitzgerald
over in the D.A.'s office.

32:16.768 --> 32:20.021
I think he and Joyce Davenport
may have a little thing going,

32:20.104 --> 32:22.357
so what we do
is consolidate his negotiation

32:22.440 --> 32:24.359
with a half a dozen others
we have pending,

32:24.442 --> 32:25.985
specifically, the Sharkey case.

32:26.069 --> 32:30.531
Sharkey? Sharkey's looking at murder one.
What's that got to do with LaRue?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.992
-You just let me handle that, Captain.
-Thanks, Phil.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.954
The point is
that Skip Fitzgerald's hot to horse-trade

32:36.037 --> 32:37.997
for a quick disposition on Sharkey.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.375
Now, if LaRue pleads no contest,

32:40.458 --> 32:42.043
Skip will wave prosecution

32:42.126 --> 32:44.087
and toss it back
to the Police Board of Rights

32:44.170 --> 32:46.965
to do whatever they think
LaRue's got coming to him.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.176
I don't mind reminding you
that I'm carrying LaRue on the cuff

32:50.259 --> 32:51.844
as a favor to Joyce Davenport.

32:51.928 --> 32:56.432
Which translates into what?
His future at your convenience?

32:56.516 --> 32:58.935
Partly that. Partly good timing.

32:59.018 --> 33:01.479
Partly that I'm pretty
damn good at what I do.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.023
Nothing like packaging defendants,
is there?

33:04.565 --> 33:06.234
A new trend in class action.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.737
Phil, would you see
if you could raise LaRue for me, please?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.197
Right, Francis.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.533
I'll see that he gets your message.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.911
Oh, now, don't look
so down in the mouth, Captain.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.454
I know what you're thinking.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.374
You haven't the slightest idea
of what I'm thinking.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.713
How many Hispanic youths?

33:28.589 --> 33:31.384
(sighs) Ten, maybe 12.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.178
-What colors were they wearing?
-What colors?

33:34.262 --> 33:36.597
Gang jackets.
Were they wearing matching jackets?

33:36.681 --> 33:39.183
No, not that I recall.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.063
-Look.
-(paper ripping)

33:46.691 --> 33:49.235
Why don't you just buy yourself
another set of hubcaps?

33:49.318 --> 33:50.903
Those kids are long gone.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.948
I have no illusions
about recovery, Captain.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.326
I just thought you might be interested
in identifying who they are.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.745
I know who they are.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.997
In fact, you might enjoy
negotiating with them.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.790
They have no illusions either.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.052
WOMAN: Hill Street Station.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.804
Turn your radio down. I can't hear you.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.641
<i>(man on radio, indistinct)</i>

34:41.913 --> 34:43.498
(sighs)

34:44.874 --> 34:47.794
-Hi.
-Hello, Grace.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.798
I slept the whole morning away.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.842
I haven't done that in years.

34:55.468 --> 34:57.512
Usually, I'm up and out.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.223
You're feeling all right, aren't you?

35:00.306 --> 35:02.725
I feel wonderful, Phil.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.105
We didn't overdo anything, hmm?

35:08.689 --> 35:10.191
No.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.195
You have time for a cup of coffee?

35:17.490 --> 35:19.826
Well, I'm sort of coffee'd out, Grace.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.702
I didn't sleep much...

35:22.578 --> 35:24.163
last night.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.251
(chuckling)

35:30.628 --> 35:32.046
I know.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.843
You're not sorry it happened, are you?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.220
Sorry? No. No way.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.389
Strike that thought from your--

35:46.602 --> 35:48.146
Hello, Mrs. Gardner.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.438
Hello, Morgan.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.361
Some friends are giving
a little dinner party tonight.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.239
I thought if you were
off-duty early enough...

35:58.322 --> 36:01.826
Tonight? Hmm.

36:03.369 --> 36:07.206
Well, I don't know about tonight, Grace.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.834
Phil, we're not kids.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.880
If there's something wrong,
let's discuss it.

36:17.049 --> 36:17.925
Uh...

36:20.887 --> 36:23.556
Look, I know it's difficult in here.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.266
I'm, um...

36:26.601 --> 36:29.687
measuring a few things downstairs.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.193
(phone rings)

36:36.652 --> 36:38.988
MAN: Hill Street Station.
Can you hold, please?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.450
(phone rings)

36:42.533 --> 36:45.077
-Furillo.
<i>-It's Washington, Captain.</i>

36:45.161 --> 36:47.663
Detective Scanlon picked up
Macafee coming out of Division

36:47.747 --> 36:51.667
and followed him up here
to the New Rochella Manor Condominiums

36:51.751 --> 36:53.294
on Roosevelt Parkway.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.796
<i>Now, on his way,</i>
<i>he made two shopping stops,</i>

36:55.880 --> 36:58.216
an Italian deli by the name of Tomasita's

36:58.299 --> 37:00.718
and a whatchamacallit--
a kid's toy store...

37:00.801 --> 37:03.471
the, uh... the Toy Bazaar.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.182
<i>-Bought a big box of something.</i>
-Good. Stay on him.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.601
As soon as he leaves,
we'll do a rundown of whoever it is

37:08.684 --> 37:09.852
he's visiting up there.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.896
I don't think
he's visiting anyone, Captain,

37:11.979 --> 37:13.439
unless they're visiting him.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.943
Run that one by me again.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.820
Well, while I was trying
to check out the names on the mailbox,

37:19.904 --> 37:22.782
the security guard comes over to I.D. me.

37:22.865 --> 37:26.452
So I flat-out asked him.
He says Macafee lives there.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.995
<i>He owns the condo.</i>

37:31.082 --> 37:32.041
Hello?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.085
Captain?

37:37.296 --> 37:38.422
(slams telephone)

37:38.506 --> 37:40.508
Southwest squadron radio is still out.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.761
Lamonica, you and Sneed
sashay over there on the double.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.721
-Bates... Lucy.
-(over radio)<i> Yeah, Lieutenant?</i>

37:45.805 --> 37:48.391
I know your book is good,
but let's hear from you regularly, huh?

37:48.474 --> 37:50.351
-(laughing)
-Thank you.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.145
<i>Hill Street. Hill Street.</i>
<i>This is Southwest, Lieutenant.</i>

37:53.229 --> 37:54.647
<i>Sorry for the loss of contact.</i>

37:54.730 --> 37:56.774
Nice to finally hear from you, Southwest.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.485
-Stay with us.
-BATES:<i> No! No!</i>

37:59.568 --> 38:02.697
-MAN (on radio):<i> Bates!</i>
-There it is. Code 2 Duckling. Bates!

38:02.780 --> 38:05.116
-Position, 6 Southwest. Who's with her?
-Code 2 Duckling.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.202
<i>-</i>BATES: <i>No! No! Help! Help!</i>
-Who the hell is with her?

38:08.286 --> 38:10.955
-BATES:<i> Let me go!</i>
-MAN (on radio): <i>We're on our way, sir.</i>

38:11.038 --> 38:13.916
Renko, Hill, get there! Get the captain.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.584
-Right away, sir.
-BATES:<i> Bobby!</i>

38:17.670 --> 38:19.964
MACAFEE: Jellybean.
Come on. Give me a jellybean.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.507
-No!
-What do you mean "no"?

38:21.590 --> 38:22.967
Come on. Open your present.

38:23.050 --> 38:27.013
-Come on. He's gonna open his present.
-(children's song plays)

38:27.096 --> 38:29.890
Come on. Open your present.
You know how to open a present.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.643
-(knocking)
-What do you think it is?

38:32.727 --> 38:34.687
BOY: Do you want a jellybean? Here.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.231
MACAFEE: What are you waiting for?
Open your present!

38:38.482 --> 38:40.651
-Mrs. Macafee?
-Yes.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.112
-I'm Captain Frank Furillo.
-Please come in.

38:43.195 --> 38:45.323
Thank you. We're sorry to disturb you.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.242
This is Detective Washington.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.704
We'd just like a word
with Detective Macafee,

38:51.787 --> 38:53.664
-if you don't mind.
-Sure. Come on in.

38:54.790 --> 38:57.251
-MACAFEE: Oh, boy. Look at that.
-Some men are here.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.593
Get up, honey.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.503
Thanks for not saying anything up there.
I mean that.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.963
How do you want to handle this?

39:43.047 --> 39:46.717
Cash? All right, Frank.
Come on. Loosen up, will you?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.095
Everyone knows you're a good cop.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.889
Don't take everything I say
so seriously, huh?

39:51.972 --> 39:54.392
-How do you want to handle this?
-I don't know yet.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.856
Maureen and me,
we've been married 18 years,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.985
ever since we graduated
high school in June.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.073
Eighteen years and five kids.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.742
You don't just get up
and walk out on somebody.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.328
Not Maureen. She...

40:15.621 --> 40:16.872
It would kill her.

40:17.957 --> 40:21.043
The kids growing up, hating my guts,
I couldn't do that, Frank.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.880
And I couldn't stand
the thought of losing Sariko.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.091
I had to make an honest woman
out of her, Frank.

40:27.174 --> 40:28.676
She's an old-fashioned woman.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.973
I guess I got a weakness
for old-fashioned girls, huh?

40:34.056 --> 40:35.891
Fertile Myrtles, both of them.

40:38.060 --> 40:41.021
And kids cost, Frank.
You know that. They cost.

40:41.689 --> 40:42.815
They need.

40:43.357 --> 40:46.694
They should have everything
that we never had before, Frank.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.865
My oldest, Carly,
she's going to nursing school.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.783
She's gonna be a surgical nurse.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.244
What do you wanna do about this, Macafee?

40:55.327 --> 40:58.080
You've got two wives and eight kids...

40:58.164 --> 41:00.040
and a lot of dirty money.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.960
And you've got LaRue hanging out there
by his fingernails.

41:03.043 --> 41:06.297
LaRue. He's a lame player, a slow thinker.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.258
No, he's not! He had a lame day, is all.

41:09.341 --> 41:13.012
Yeah, tell me more.
I'm ten times the cop he ever will be!

41:13.679 --> 41:15.848
I got 11 decorations, Frank.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.684
Two for valor.

41:23.230 --> 41:26.192
You know I'm up for lieutenant
next January? You know that?

41:27.109 --> 41:28.569
This is not happening.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.072
I don't believe this is happening to me.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.619
Don't let it happen, Frank.
I don't wanna lose everything.

41:37.244 --> 41:38.329
One of us...

41:39.246 --> 41:41.540
Find a way, will you? Please?

41:43.167 --> 41:46.295
One of us has to go downtown
and explain it.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.632
I think you'll be better off if you do it.

41:51.425 --> 41:52.593
Frank.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.512
Now, Macafee.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.515
You do it now.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.937
(engine starts)

42:03.020 --> 42:06.524
(dramatic music playing)

42:31.298 --> 42:33.467
(chattering)

42:33.551 --> 42:35.844
WOMAN: Did anybody see the Morgan file?

42:35.928 --> 42:37.429
Did anybody claim this apple?

42:38.430 --> 42:41.475
-Going once.
-MAN: Who's that? Is that him?

42:41.559 --> 42:42.726
MAN 2: Yeah.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.604
(woman speaking indistinctly)

43:00.911 --> 43:03.497
(chattering)

43:11.005 --> 43:12.756
WOMAN (whispering): He's sick.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.970
Lucy's down at the emergency room.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.015
We're all gonna punch out.
We figure it's her collar.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.099
Right.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.106
Hey, Belker.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.859
You got a visitor, babe.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.202
(softly) Hi.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.584
Mick, I'm Debbie Kaplan.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.337
You're, uh...

43:54.131 --> 43:55.841
You're a very nice person.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.761
I mean, you're much nicer
than I ever expected.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.805
By that I mean you're not a real dog.

44:03.307 --> 44:07.227
Thank you. You're pretty
nice-looking yourself.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.731
Hey, you guys. It's love.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.317
Mm-hmm. I can tell.

44:14.234 --> 44:16.195
-(giggling)
-Would you like to sit down?

44:23.744 --> 44:26.497
-How'd it go at Internal Affairs?
-Piece of cake.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.666
They chewed my leg a little
and slapped my wrist.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.792
That was it.

44:29.875 --> 44:33.545
J.D., you lie the way
the rest of us breathe.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.840
I happen to know they
gave you an official reprimand

44:36.924 --> 44:38.592
and six months' probation.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.846
You've been skating
on thin ice, my friend.

44:42.930 --> 44:45.391
Next time you fall through,
I may just let you sink.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.937
You're a hell of a cop
when you're on your game, J.D.

44:50.646 --> 44:53.273
-Don't blow it.
-I won't.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.650
You got my word on that.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.825
Thanks.

45:08.247 --> 45:11.500
WOMAN: Oh, hold on. Do we have anyone
who can speak Spanish?

45:13.460 --> 45:16.380
-You all right, Phil?
-Mmm.

45:16.463 --> 45:20.801
Uh, Henry mentioned
you had to go off on a personal matter.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.221
Nothing serious, I hope.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.348
Oh, not in the way you think, Francis.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.059
Not health or anything of that nature.

45:30.060 --> 45:33.731
-Uh, do you mind, uh...
-Please.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.446
Francis,

45:42.364 --> 45:45.617
have you ever had two women...

45:46.285 --> 45:48.078
totally in love with you?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.330
Totally?

45:52.082 --> 45:54.084
Uh, I can't say as I have.

45:54.960 --> 45:58.297
Well, not to my knowledge.

45:59.673 --> 46:02.384
But I take it you and...

46:05.179 --> 46:06.680
It's no laughing matter.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.725
When I told her about the other woman,

46:11.059 --> 46:13.187
Cindy locked herself in the bathroom.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.024
I finally had to kick down the door.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.861
Then I had to reset the hinges
and put it back up.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.155
I mean, you can't not
have a bathroom door.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.453
Did you finally get it
worked out satisfactorily?

46:36.627 --> 46:38.295
Did you get it worked out, Phil?

46:39.296 --> 46:42.508
Oh. I really don't know what I'm gonna do.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.845
I'm basically of
the monogamous persuasion.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.972
Oh, after today,

46:49.056 --> 46:53.101
you have no idea how refreshing
that is to hear.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.523
WOMAN: Hill Street Station.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.859
I've got to yield to you
on this one, Frank.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.530
I thought LaRue was
as dirty as Original Sin.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.658
He may be a little rough
around the edges, Counselor.

47:07.741 --> 47:08.992
I'll yield to you on that one.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.286
But he's too smart a cop
to go on the gimme.

47:13.413 --> 47:16.375
This time, but pay attention.

47:16.917 --> 47:19.127
-LaRue's a time bomb.
-(water running)

47:19.211 --> 47:22.005
And you don't wanna be too close
when he goes off again.

47:24.341 --> 47:25.759
Come here.

47:26.593 --> 47:27.719
(spits water)

47:28.345 --> 47:29.388
Mmm.

47:35.435 --> 47:37.563
-(sighs)
-Oh!

47:37.646 --> 47:39.273
First-rate digits,

47:39.356 --> 47:42.651
marred only by neglected fingernails.

47:43.902 --> 47:46.446
Who does he think he is,
anyway, Paul Newman?

47:46.530 --> 47:48.407
-Who, LaRue?
-Macafee.

47:48.991 --> 47:51.201
Try to keep up with
the conversational flow.

47:52.995 --> 47:55.330
What I don't understand is
how he was able to handle

47:55.414 --> 47:56.874
two wives emotionally.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.835
When you couldn't even handle one.

48:00.836 --> 48:01.795
(sighs)

48:03.338 --> 48:05.257
How do you suppose
you and Fay might get along

48:05.340 --> 48:06.508
under the same roof?

48:09.094 --> 48:12.514
I might ask the same of you
and Skip Fitzgerald.

48:12.598 --> 48:15.809
Oh, good old Skip Fitzgerald.
You think of him that way, do you?

48:15.893 --> 48:19.354
Mmm. We've had lunch a few times.

48:19.438 --> 48:22.190
He might make a good addition
to the partnership,

48:23.609 --> 48:26.445
but you'd always be senior member, Frank.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.240
Ooh! Pretty close clip, Counselor.

48:30.324 --> 48:34.494
Oh. Sorry. Here, let me.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.997
-(phone rings)
-Ooh! Don't answer that.

48:38.582 --> 48:39.625
Hello?

48:41.001 --> 48:44.338
-Oh, hi, Skip!
-Aw, you!

48:44.421 --> 48:47.007
-No, you're not bothering me at all.
-(grumbling)

48:49.176 --> 48:51.637
(music plays)
