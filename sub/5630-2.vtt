00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.369 --> 00:01.702
- Hey, Olinsky,

00:02.735 --> 00:05.106
Michelle Sovana keeps
calling for you.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.275
Who is this girl?
- My daughter.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.543
- I got to go see
a man about a dog.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.943
- Hey.
- Otis!

00:12.413 --> 00:13.581
Oh, that's okay.
- Sorry.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.316
- Roman won't mind.

00:15.316 --> 00:18.752
[dramatic music]

00:18.752 --> 00:21.021
- You want to hold on to
your badge, there's conditions.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.823
For starters,
you're gonna live with me

00:22.823 --> 00:24.658
and take
weekly drug tests.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.994
- I can do that.
- There's one more thing.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.130
Bunny is the cancer
in your life.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.700
I want you to sever all ties
with your mother.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.940
Morning.
- Thank you.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.415
You know,
taken out of context,

00:47.415 --> 00:50.984
a plastic cup's really just
a harmless little thing.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.253
- How you feeling?

00:53.254 --> 00:56.257
- Mm...

00:56.257 --> 00:58.759
marathon headaches
are gone.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.362
The last couple days,
I feel rock solid.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.932
- Strange having you up
in your old bedroom.

01:04.932 --> 01:08.469
- Oh, man, that window still
really shakes in the wind.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.774
[cell phone vibrating]

01:15.543 --> 01:16.710
[cell phone beeps]

01:16.710 --> 01:18.812
Bunny again.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.384
I'll handle it.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.487
- There's nothing
to think about.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.289
You just take care of it.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.362
- Stop!
- Chicago Police!

01:34.362 --> 01:36.864
- Squad, this is 21-13
responding to shots fired.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.267
Chasing male, black,
on foot, white T, jeans,

01:39.267 --> 01:42.002
headed west in the gangway
of 3400 May towards Carpenter.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.205
- Copy that.
- I'm right behind you!

01:47.175 --> 01:49.543
[horn honks]
- Hey!

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.289 --> 02:03.757
Roman, get the back!
- Got it.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.067
[dog barking]

02:16.003 --> 02:17.905
- Gun!
[gunshots]

02:17.905 --> 02:21.609
[barking continues]

02:21.609 --> 02:23.844
21-13, shots fired
at the police.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.646
Roman!
- Keep going.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.535
- I only ran 'cause
y'all started running.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.937
- Yeah?
Why'd you shoot?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.605
- I want a lawyer.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.242
- You're gonna need a dentist.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.151
Hey, give me your hands.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.653
Where's the gun?

03:05.653 --> 03:06.854
Huh?
Where is it?

03:25.306 --> 03:25.439
.

03:26.039 --> 03:26.874
- The offender apparently
got a new piece,

03:28.041 --> 03:29.977
went popping off
at a cookout.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.413
Got to love a heat wave
in Chicago.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.582
- So we chased him in here,
subdued him

03:34.582 --> 03:37.885
using the minimal force
necessary to affect an arrest.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.454
- Jack-off tried
to ditch the hardware.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.989
He threw it in a yard
four houses south.

03:41.989 --> 03:46.026
- I spotted the blood,
opened the refrigerator.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.495
Never saw anything
quite like that.

03:47.495 --> 03:51.632
- I sincerely doubt your shooter
wanted us to find this.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.634
These are unrelated acts.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.670
- This is a black neighborhood,
always has been.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.473
We're gonna find out
somebody moved that kid here.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.008
- That call that was on the zone
this morning--

04:01.008 --> 04:03.311
kid went missing
from Rogers Park.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.346
I think this is him.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.181
- Hey, darling.
Hey.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.318
You all right?
- Yeah.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.625
- We're gonna solve this...

04:18.625 --> 04:20.027
whatever it was.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.797
- I know we will.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.237
- You know, I started
a knock-knock joke

04:30.237 --> 04:32.506
three blocks ago?

04:34.342 --> 04:37.244
- Sorry.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.047
It's these cases
with kids.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.216
It's always the hardest.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.119
You think you'd
get used to it...

04:46.119 --> 04:49.189
looking down
on someone's son,

04:49.189 --> 04:52.159
their daughter...

04:52.159 --> 04:54.462
seeing your own kid
staring back at you.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.532
- I don't know, man.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.369
You get used to it,
you're either lying,

05:01.369 --> 05:04.372
or you're giving yourself
too much credit.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.376
- Yeah.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.144
- We owe this kid our best,
so what do we know?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.213
- All right, tender-age
white child found dead

05:13.213 --> 05:14.582
in a black neighborhood.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.816
We're still waiting
on the ME,

05:15.816 --> 05:19.587
but responding EMTs
indicate that, um...

05:19.587 --> 05:20.954
kid's neck was snapped.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.223
He was stabbed
in the abdomen three times.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.693
- And his wrists and ankles
were bound with sailor's knots,

05:25.693 --> 05:26.827
for what that's worth.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.295
- His name was Jeremy Dolan.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.632
He was reported missing
36 hours ago from Rogers Park.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.666
He was eight years old.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.901
His parents are
Richard and Rochelle.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.636
They're waiting at the morgue
to ID the body.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.071
- Rogers Park--that's
three miles north of that house.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.607
- Well, he was probably
killed elsewhere,

05:39.607 --> 05:41.509
transported to the scene.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.077
We got no eyeball witnesses of
the body being placed, though.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.245
- Do we know
who owns the house?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.147
- Yep, local
real-estate investors.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.849
It's one of 150 properties

05:48.849 --> 05:51.251
that they're buying
and fixing up in that area.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.554
- I'll see if there's
anything there.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.556
- All right,
we start in Rogers Park.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.158
I want all in-service calls
the last 48 hours.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.326
Where was he abducted?

05:59.326 --> 06:00.994
[cell phone vibrating]
Somebody heard a scream,

06:00.994 --> 06:04.832
saw a car they didn't recognize,
strange face, something.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.266
- Boy's family's on the way
to the morgue.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.436
I want to be there
when they ID him.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.237
- Yeah.
- Al, you come with?

06:10.237 --> 06:11.304
- Yeah.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.518
- [sobbing]

06:24.518 --> 06:27.455
That's him.
That's--

06:36.630 --> 06:39.066
- He went missing Saturday.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.270
- He went on a bike ride.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.639
He was gonna go see
his friend.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.480
- We found him
three and a half miles south.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.483
Would he have ridden
that far from home?

06:55.483 --> 06:58.886
- They found his bike
a block from the house.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.888
Why don't you know this?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.960
- We're getting up to speed.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.898
- You need to find who did this.
- That's our intention.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.669
- I can't--
I can't do this.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.505
I can't do this.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.508
[door opens]

07:22.510 --> 07:24.512
[door closes]

07:24.512 --> 07:28.215
- Do you know,
was he abused sexually?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.953
- Medical examiner hasn't had
a chance to work yet.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.690
- Was there a history
of abuse in the family--

07:36.690 --> 07:38.726
relatives, family friends?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.530
- His life was perfect.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.733
Same block I grew up on.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.535
There's no problems
on that block,

07:47.535 --> 07:50.003
and when there is...

07:50.003 --> 07:51.972
we deal with them.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.076
- If we need to reach you...

07:56.076 --> 07:57.978
- I'll be at home

07:57.978 --> 08:00.614
trying to keep my wife
from falling apart.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.331
- The night of the
disappearance, yes, ma'am.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.800
- No, we didn't hear
anything.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.702
- No screaming, shouting,
slamming doors?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.337
- I would've gone and checked.
We watched each other's kids.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.306
These were good people.
- I understand.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.576
Um, were your windows open?

08:28.576 --> 08:31.178
This would've been
6:30, 7:00 Saturday night.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.080
- They were open.
It was warm.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.447
And my hearing's perfect.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.416
- Is anybody
a little too nice,

08:36.416 --> 08:38.885
like maybe extra candy
on Halloween kind of thing?

08:38.885 --> 08:40.621
- There's no one here
who's too friendly.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.056
They'd get dealt with.
We didn't hear anything.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.961
- So, uh, how well did you know
the Dolan's, Mister...

08:47.961 --> 08:50.598
- Boyd.
Damien Boyd.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.265
I've, uh--

08:52.265 --> 08:54.201
I've known Richie
my whole life.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.770
I grew up
down the block here.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.073
I don't live here anymore,
though, so...

09:00.073 --> 09:01.609
I wish I could help you.

09:01.609 --> 09:05.178
My friends are grieving,
and I got to get these inside.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.748
Sorry. Our condolences.

09:07.748 --> 09:08.982
- Come on.

09:11.619 --> 09:15.823
- So no one saw
or heard anything.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.258
- Nothing they
feel like sharing.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.630
- Hey, I've been looking
for you.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.931
- You got a way
of saying that

09:23.931 --> 09:25.966
where it never sounds
like good news.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.269
- Regarding you
and Lindsay...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.504
All right, I don't know what
your relationship status is,

09:31.504 --> 09:33.440
and I don't care,

09:33.440 --> 09:37.945
but I need to know someone's
got her back 24 hours a day.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.447
- Yeah, I, uh--

09:40.447 --> 09:41.849
Always.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.454
- [sighs]
Special Investigations Unit

09:47.454 --> 09:50.290
sent over the files for every
registered sex offender

09:50.290 --> 09:52.292
in the vicinity
of Rogers Park.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.795
- The ME found tissue
under Jeremy's fingernails.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.297
Little guy
went down fighting.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.799
Said no sign
of sexual assault,

09:58.799 --> 10:00.701
but that doesn't mean
he couldn't have been made to...

10:00.701 --> 10:02.102
- I don't know--

10:02.102 --> 10:04.805
this block he was snatched from,
they're pretty tight-knit.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.574
Seems like an odd pool
to pick your victims from.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.576
- But if it was about sex,
there's no logic.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.944
It's just impulse.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.882
- Hey, this guy moved
onto the block last year.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.249
He's in from Salt Lake City.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.752
His PO logged a complaint.
He never registered in Chicago.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.989
- What's his name?
- Darren Woodhull.

10:21.989 --> 10:26.326
- So this is what
corporate money buys, huh?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.161
You want to take
the lead on this?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.963
- I do, in fact.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.667
Darren Woodhull?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.936
- Officers.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.738
You must be here
about the boy.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.743
Two child murders equidistant
from my condominium

10:42.743 --> 10:43.877
in Salt Lake--

10:43.877 --> 10:45.913
this was 2012.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.348
I was detained
for nine hours by the PD

10:48.348 --> 10:50.217
and told,
in no uncertain terms,

10:50.217 --> 10:52.920
that a confession was
the only card I had to play.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.823
It's tiresome
being the usual suspect.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.357
- I imagine
your victims grew tired

10:57.357 --> 10:59.860
of your abuse
back in Utah.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.362
- I made mistakes.
I sought treatment.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.564
- Court-ordered.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.899
- I know my rights,
officers.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.735
I don't need a lawyer.
I have nothing to hide.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.369
- Except for the fact
that you didn't register

11:09.369 --> 11:12.039
as a sex offender
when you moved to Chicago.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.874
Why not?
- I did.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.208
Your city's computer system

11:15.208 --> 11:17.745
created an erroneous
problem report.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.080
And I have an alibi
for 6:45 Saturday night.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.516
I was here,
stuck in a client presentation.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.953
- You have a car?
- I do.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.588
It's been in the shop all week.
- What happened to your neck?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.159
Did you maybe get attacked?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.327
- No more questions for today.
I have a meeting to get to.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.629
- This isn't Salt Lake, Darren!
Sit down!

11:39.266 --> 11:41.534
We got a kid down the street
from you dead,

11:41.534 --> 11:43.636
and you're on the verge
of pissing me off.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.775
- Your injury--
what happened?

11:47.775 --> 11:49.576
- I was sailing.

11:49.576 --> 11:52.279
I rented a Sunfish, capsized
on some rocks yesterday.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.014
- We're gonna need
the contact information

11:54.014 --> 11:56.683
of everyone that you were
working with over the weekend,

11:56.683 --> 11:59.419
and you should stay
in town.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.126
- So a needle
fell out of his gym bag.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.961
- Yeah,
I know what I saw, Adam.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.797
Plus, he is limping
and sweating.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.164
- Well, you got to talk
to him.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.333
I can't, because he's gonna know
you sent your boyfriend in

12:13.333 --> 12:14.802
to ask him what the hell's
going on--

12:14.802 --> 12:16.036
Sorry, your fiancÃ©.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.538
- I would never
ask you to do that.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.672
I would,
on the other hand,

12:19.672 --> 12:23.276
ask you to help me
break into his locker.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.245
Only--it's only
'cause we're worried about him.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.980
- Time-out.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.215
All right,
if Roman is using,

12:28.215 --> 12:31.518
which, to me, sounds like
science fiction...

12:31.518 --> 12:33.020
- Yeah?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.856
- Then he's gonna need help,
and CPD has treatment programs,

12:35.856 --> 12:37.825
and you, as his friend,
you got to talk to him

12:37.825 --> 12:39.492
before he loses his grip.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.966
- Yeah.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.234
- You can do this.
I believe in you.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.601
You got to talk to him.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.971
And, uh, you smell
really good today.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.239
Have we talked about that?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.841
- How about you tell me that

12:53.841 --> 12:56.009
when I'm not, like, wrapped up
in semi-breathable polyester?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.177
- Okay.
- Okay?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.745
- Okay.
Go talk to him.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.848
- Ugh.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.391
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.926
- Sorry.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.862
- Ah.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.364
How long
you been cooking that up?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.867
- Look, I said I was sorry.
- I busted you out of lockup.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.501
You took my cash,
then you disappeared.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.702
- It was juvie.
- Yeah?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.938
- And it was 40 bucks.
- Okay.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.177
All right,
all right, all right.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.313
Where you been staying?
- With some friends.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.017
Friends of friends,

13:37.017 --> 13:38.651
but, you know,
they got bills and stuff.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.221
So, if you have, like,
80 bucks, that'd be awesome.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.689
- Not on me.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.926
But listen, how about you come
by tomorrow, we have some lunch?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.995
And then we need to get you
on a plan.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.030
- A plan?

13:50.030 --> 13:53.466
What was your plan
when you knocked up my mom?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.202
Yeah, you know what?

13:55.202 --> 13:58.906
Maybe you should figure out
your own plan first, okay?

13:58.906 --> 14:01.241
This was a waste
of bus fare.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.213
- Who was that?

14:06.213 --> 14:09.616
- Just a neighborhood kid
looking to bum a smoke.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.918
- Okay.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.020
Darren Woodhull,
our registered sex offender--

14:13.020 --> 14:14.054
guy had a gash on his neck.
- Okay.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.355
- Says he got it sailing.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.556
Boathouse says none
of their guys

14:16.556 --> 14:17.958
administered first aid
that day.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.226
He's lying.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.995
- You got his 20?
- Office says he popped home.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.605
- Hey, get back inside!
I said inside, now!

14:34.407 --> 14:36.944
Chicago Police!

14:38.745 --> 14:40.780
- Guy lied right
to my face,

14:40.780 --> 14:43.951
violated his parole
by not registering in Chicago,

14:43.951 --> 14:45.785
in case you need a reason.

15:15.015 --> 15:15.148
.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.417
- Drop the weapon!
- Who are you?

15:18.718 --> 15:19.987
- We're the police.
Who are you?

15:19.987 --> 15:21.688
- I'm Darren Woodhull's
protector.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.356
- You want to die in a closet?
Drop the gun!

15:23.356 --> 15:26.093
- Sh--show me a badge.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.494
- Right here.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.266
- Don't hurt me, please.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.135
Aah!
Oh, oh!

15:35.135 --> 15:38.771
[handcuffs clicking]

15:38.771 --> 15:41.408
[indistinct chatter]

15:41.408 --> 15:44.177
- Boss.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.213
This is, uh, Rosie Dolan.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.849
Her brother is--
- My brother was murdered.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.551
Officer Ruzek said
there's no reward

15:51.551 --> 15:54.421
set up
to find Jeremy's killer.

15:54.421 --> 15:58.258
Here, you should set one up.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.028
Money makes people
want to help,

16:01.028 --> 16:04.164
and it seems like you need
all the help you can get.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.370
- Well, we're gonna find
who did this to your brother.

16:11.604 --> 16:16.043
In the meantime,
I need you to keep saving, okay?

16:16.043 --> 16:18.178
- Okay.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.414
- Hey, let's go.
Your mom's waiting, okay?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.537
- Hey...

16:44.537 --> 16:48.075
I want a full workup
on this Vaughn Bash, you hear?

16:55.615 --> 16:56.916
- [exhales deeply]

16:56.916 --> 16:59.652
Vaughn Bash,
registered sex offender

16:59.652 --> 17:02.222
in the state of Illinois
since '98.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.191
- I'm not the one you need
to worry about--Darren is.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.724
- You mean
your roommate, Darren?

17:05.724 --> 17:07.327
We're very worried.
He disappeared.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.229
- You don't understand.
He's in danger.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.663
- What did you do
to that kid?

17:10.663 --> 17:11.763
- I didn't do anything.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.366
You got the wrong guy,
I swear.

17:14.401 --> 17:20.140
Oh!
[groans]

17:20.140 --> 17:21.773
- Look at me.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.777
Woodhull had a gash
on his neck.

17:24.777 --> 17:25.877
It was fresh.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.547
- I know.

17:27.547 --> 17:31.118
We had a fight.
It got physical.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.921
I didn't call 911
because it's not allowed

17:34.921 --> 17:38.024
for two people like us
to live together.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.293
I don't expect
you to sympathize,

17:40.293 --> 17:43.130
but we need each other.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.804
- If Woodhull told you where
he was going, believe me...

17:51.804 --> 17:54.207
believe me,
now is the time to speak up.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.042
- I'm trying to tell you,
he didn't run.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.911
They took him, okay?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.280
- Who took him?
- I don't know.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.814
He--he came home
to take a nap.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.451
I-I heard shouting.
I hid.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.286
When your team came in,
I thought it was them

18:06.286 --> 18:07.554
trying to come back
to rob us.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.289
That's why I had the gun.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.625
[groaning]

18:12.625 --> 18:14.761
- Antonio!
Antonio.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.167
Get out of here.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.801
- [breathing shakily]

18:21.801 --> 18:24.837
[door opens, closes]

18:27.640 --> 18:29.976
Right now...

18:29.976 --> 18:31.211
the truth.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.645
- That's the truth.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.182
I got nothing
to gain by lying.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.689
- Hey...

18:43.990 --> 18:45.625
Almost lost you in there.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.026
- You're gonna tell me
to toe a line?

18:47.026 --> 18:49.028
- I'll tell you how much ice
to put in your drink,

18:49.028 --> 18:52.599
and right now
I need you to relax.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.038
[door opens]

18:59.038 --> 19:02.775
- Hank, Miles tried to ping
Woodhull's cell--nothing.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.910
- What about his car?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.412
I mean,
if he transported a body,

19:05.412 --> 19:06.546
he left DNA behind.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.014
- Yeah, Woodhull said
it's in the shop,

19:08.014 --> 19:09.949
so Olinsky's on his way
to check it out now.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.484
- Well, get the Dolans
in here.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.952
I want to look them
in the eye.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.754
I mean, tight neighborhood
like that,

19:14.754 --> 19:17.257
they got a pair of sex offenders
shacked up four doors down,

19:17.257 --> 19:18.425
they know
nothing about it?

19:18.425 --> 19:20.660
- Caught the tail end of that.
You buying this?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.295
Guy got kidnapped
from his house?

19:22.295 --> 19:23.996
- I don't think we're getting
the whole story.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.967
- Yeah, from who?
- Any of them.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.939
- Kurt Hollister.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.574
- That's me.
Can I help you?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.142
- Yeah, we're the police.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.345
- We're looking for a car that
belongs to Darren Woodhull.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.947
- Yeah, it's out there--
blue sedan.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.784
You like him
for the murder?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.053
Guy always gave me the creeps,
to be honest.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.388
- Oh, yeah, how's that?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.290
- I don't know.
You ever just get that feeling?

19:50.290 --> 19:51.491
- All the time,

19:51.491 --> 19:54.160
but then again,
I work with this guy, so...

19:54.160 --> 19:55.628
- How well do you know
Darren Woodhull?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.497
- Ah, keeps to himself.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.400
Freak like that--
got no right drawing breath.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.701
Think he knows it.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.903
No secrets here
in Rogers Park.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.772
- Hey, Jay!

20:13.145 --> 20:17.250
Searched the interior.
It's clean enough.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.119
Pop this trunk,
it gets real.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.854
There's bloodstains
under the mat.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.424
- It's Woodhull.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.859
All right.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.796
- So we have
an update for you...

20:29.796 --> 20:32.599
person of interest.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.867
- Who?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.369
- The same person
you thought of

20:36.369 --> 20:39.506
before you set foot
in my district.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.774
You know, neighbors say
they didn't hear any screams

20:41.774 --> 20:43.610
when your son
went missing.

20:43.610 --> 20:47.847
- He didn't scream because
he knew Darren Woodhull.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.784
- At number 2336, yeah,
everybody knows him.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.354
He's a pervert,
and he did time for it.

20:54.354 --> 20:58.358
- He's missing.
- Maybe he's on the run.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.461
- Rochelle...

21:01.461 --> 21:03.630
where's your husband?

21:03.630 --> 21:06.333
If he intervened,
we need to know about it.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.834
- I'm not following.
- I think you are.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.536
- I lost my son!
- I'm being polite right now.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.637
We know you lost your son.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.238
- You know what?
You want answers. So do I.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.673
We don't owe
you people anything.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.008
- I'll tell you
what you don't want.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.346
You don't want to
lose my sympathy.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.947
Listen to me.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.049
Whatever your husband did,

21:23.049 --> 21:26.052
you're an accessory right now
right where you sit.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.358
- He did what
a husband should do.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.865
- Now tell me
where he went.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.836
[man moaning]

21:43.836 --> 21:46.373
[thud]
- Answer me!

21:52.812 --> 21:56.148
- Answer me!

21:56.148 --> 21:57.717
Answer me!

21:57.717 --> 22:00.887
- Chicago Police!
Up against the wall, now!

22:00.887 --> 22:05.692
Are you out of your mind? Now!
- I got him.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.728
- Give me that.
What's the matter with you?

22:13.433 --> 22:13.566
.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.635
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

22:19.005 --> 22:20.873
- Damien Boyd...

22:20.873 --> 22:23.009
going above and beyond
for your friends, huh?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.877
- They'd do
the same thing for me

22:24.877 --> 22:26.679
if something happened
to my kids.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.882
- Hey, this your building?
- No.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.984
We do maintenance
for the management.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.153
- Yeah, but you got the key
to the boiler room.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.323
It's a nice place
to put a beating on a guy.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.958
- Hey, what do you know

22:38.958 --> 22:40.993
that makes you so sure
Darren Woodhull's the guy?

22:40.993 --> 22:42.529
- Aside from
liking little boys?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.030
- Aside from that,
actually, yeah.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.332
- He followed Jeremy home
from school.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.167
Probably got a hard drive
filled with garbage.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.669
The guy's demented.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.838
I still lived on the block,
he never would've moved in.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.640
He was gonna confess.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.876
- And after that?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.645
- I don't know.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.513
We didn't get that far.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.582
You know, you guys should be
thanking me right now.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.583
We solved your case.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.951
- Well, we put
the pieces together.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.086
If they fit,
then maybe.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.889
Until then, come on.
- Why?

23:09.889 --> 23:11.658
- Wild guess.
You're under arrest.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.726
Let's go.
- Come on, get up.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.333
- Ah, you got my text?

23:21.333 --> 23:23.570
- Look, Mom, this--

23:23.570 --> 23:26.038
I need this
for work, okay?

23:26.038 --> 23:29.075
I can't be getting calls
and texts and 911 messages

23:29.075 --> 23:30.276
from you all hours.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.944
- I know, but I worry
about you, sweetheart.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.780
- And I appreciate that.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.215
I do, okay?
But I'm good.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.884
At least I'm--
I'm getting better.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.251
The truth is--

23:39.251 --> 23:41.253
- Hey, JoJo's coming over
tonight for drinks.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.489
They really miss you.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.057
Mom, we need time apart.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.560
It's not that
you're bad for me.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.631
It's--it's that we're bad
for each other.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.266
- This is not you talking.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.970
This is Hank Voight.
He put you up to this.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.239
- No, Mom,
it's not like that.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.341
This is me talking.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.511
- [chuckles]
Same old routine--

24:04.511 --> 24:05.612
the minute we get close,

24:05.612 --> 24:07.079
he has to drive a wedge
through us.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.582
- Please don't make this
any harder than it is.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.084
- [scoffs]
He's gonna get you killed.

24:12.084 --> 24:15.522
He's gonna get you killed
like he got Nadia killed.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.894
[cell phone vibrates]
- Okay.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.029
[phone beeps]

24:23.029 --> 24:24.897
We have a case.
I got to go.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.966
When I'm ready to talk,
I'll find you.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.542
- Roman, can we stop
for a second?

24:35.542 --> 24:36.543
- Yeah, what's up?

24:36.543 --> 24:38.444
- You tell me.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.812
Come on, man,
you aren't yourself.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.147
I'm worried.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.282
Look, I-I saw that needle
in your bag, and I just--

24:43.282 --> 24:45.451
Hey, I want you to know
that I'm here for you.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.719
Whatever's going on
in your life,

24:46.719 --> 24:48.287
you don't have to hide
anything from me.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.557
I need you to tell me something,
so I know what's going on.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.891
- All right,
Burgess, stop.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.960
The needle...

24:53.960 --> 24:55.862
I'll explain tonight.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.096
I promise.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.439
- Hey, Antonio,
we got a problem.

25:07.439 --> 25:10.142
I just got off the phone
with Area North.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.678
His son is missing.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.582
- That's not possible.
I saw him this morning.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.649
- How old?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.651
- He's, uh--
he's seven years old,

25:18.651 --> 25:19.886
in the first grade.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.088
- He didn't make it home
from school.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.058
- That's some timing.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.594
You want to tell me
what's really going on

25:27.594 --> 25:29.228
or get charged
for kidnapping and assault?

25:29.228 --> 25:33.399
- I swear to God.
I don't know anything.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.501
Hey. Hey!

25:35.501 --> 25:37.469
You can't leave me
in here!

25:37.469 --> 25:39.939
What'd they say?
Is he missing or dead?

25:43.810 --> 25:45.778
- Damien Boyd.
- Yeah, his son's missing.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.279
- Snatched at 3:00 p.m.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.448
- While they're beating a
confession out of the wrong guy.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.084
- The whole damn unit thought
we had Woodhull dead to rights.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.020
- We saw
what we wanted to see.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.923
I want everything
on everyone involved.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.525
- Yeah, I'm looking
at it now.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.027
Thank you.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.962
Lab results got back.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.531
The blood in Woodhull's trunk
is a match for Jeremy Dolan.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.233
- The blood is how old?
- It's two days old.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.168
He was transported
in that car.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.638
- But the car's been
in the shop for six days.

26:11.638 --> 26:15.007
- Huh. All right,
who had access to the vehicle?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.643
- [scoffs]

26:16.643 --> 26:19.045
It's the mechanic.
I'll go.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.981
- Hey, we're still missing
the big picture here.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.950
We need to know why.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.885
Take Alvin.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.525
- Hey, we're looking
for Kurt Hollister.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.662
- He went out
a couple hours ago.

26:35.662 --> 26:38.530
- He say where?
- No.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.032
- We're gonna check
in his office.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.901
Got the key?
- Nope.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.370
- Hit it.
- Yeah.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.338
- [mouths words]

27:06.158 --> 27:08.360
- Guess we got
to knock it down.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.066
- We should check this.
We got to get in there.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.906
Nice.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.880
- Oh, okay.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.918
- Who do you think this is?

27:31.918 --> 27:34.120
- We'll find out.
- It's Hollister.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.056
He's on the run.

27:42.729 --> 27:42.795
.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.130
- Our main target
is Kurt Hollister.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.935
Last known location was his
mechanic shop four hours ago.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.903
We got Tac guys sitting
on his residence

27:50.903 --> 27:53.205
and an Amber alert out
on the vehicle and the kid.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.408
- The body in the freezer
belonged to Ray Malone.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.978
He was 38 years old.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.313
He died a block
from where he was born.

28:01.313 --> 28:04.751
- Malone is a knock-around guy--
misdemeanor priors.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.319
Somehow, he's the nexus.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.222
He went to high school
with the father of the victim

28:10.222 --> 28:12.058
and the father
of the missing kid.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.325
- So what's the motive?

28:13.325 --> 28:16.395
Why brutally murder a kid,
take off with a second,

28:16.395 --> 28:18.430
and then leave
an unrelated male body behind?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.166
- He's out there, and he's
holding a seven-year-old boy.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.334
He's not some mastermind.
We should have him in custody.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.172
- We were right there.
We talked to him.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.875
- We all missed this.
Let's just connect the dots.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.811
Who was Ray Malone to this guy?
How's he end up in his freezer?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.685
- So...

28:39.685 --> 28:41.387
Ray Malone.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.558
- Ray, uh...

28:48.928 --> 28:51.530
Ray was the guy with
the worst luck in the world.

28:51.530 --> 28:55.567
He had lymphoma,
maybe two months to live.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.070
You know, when we grew up,
we were tight--

28:58.070 --> 29:00.372
me, Richard, and Ray.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.274
Not quite a crew,
but, uh...

29:02.274 --> 29:04.977
[chuckles]
We weren't exactly saints.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.948
One night--this is maybe,
uh, 18 years ago--

29:08.948 --> 29:12.551
they were hanging out
behind Ray's house

29:12.551 --> 29:16.555
checking out
Ray's dad's gun, and...

29:16.555 --> 29:19.258
it went off.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.894
They run down
to the end of the gangway.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.298
There's a kid...

29:26.298 --> 29:29.001
that got shot.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.671
Complete and total accident,
but, uh...

29:32.671 --> 29:35.474
that's not gonna help
that kid, right?

29:35.474 --> 29:36.976
So they, uh--they moved him

29:36.976 --> 29:39.478
under the house
at the end there,

29:39.478 --> 29:40.913
run over to my place,

29:40.913 --> 29:43.515
and, uh, I was studying
for finals.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.855
But I hid the gun for them.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.324
Woke up, and the...

29:52.324 --> 29:55.327
the whole neighborhood
was one big funeral.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.563
- For Hollister's little boy.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.332
- Yeah, he snapped.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.834
He, uh...

30:01.834 --> 30:04.136
he started drinking,
picking fights.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.773
Wife took off, and poor Ray...

30:07.773 --> 30:09.475
it wrecked him.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.845
He couldn't hold down a job,
so I, uh--

30:12.845 --> 30:14.847
I gave him money
until I couldn't.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.683
So he stole.

30:17.683 --> 30:22.188
We never told what we did.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.991
Hollister, he--he--
he had a temper.

30:24.991 --> 30:28.460
And we thought, you know, he--
he's gonna kill us, all of us.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.462
So, uh...

30:30.462 --> 30:32.298
[scoffs]

30:32.298 --> 30:35.101
Now look at what's going on.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.803
Listen to me.

30:37.803 --> 30:41.307
If I could trade my life
for my kid, I would.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.009
But you can't do that
for me.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.018
- He's coming after you
now because Ray was dying.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.586
He must've gone to Hollister
to clear his conscience.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.055
- Yeah.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.659
Be honest with me.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.064
Do you think my son's
still alive right now?

31:10.069 --> 31:13.572
- All-call message went out
on Hollister 30 minutes ago.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.008
I want to be apprised
of any sightings.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.709
- Sarge,
Boyd's son, Conner--

31:17.709 --> 31:19.545
most likely snatched
on his way home from school.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.413
Got a team canvassing
the route home right now.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.015
We just got nothing
useful so far.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.750
- I flagged the plate
on his car.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.285
Troopers are shutting
down the ramps.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.754
- Ah, we got to move.
Just got a hit on that plate.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.223
Patrol's already down there.
We got to go.

31:39.698 --> 31:40.832
- 21-13 squad.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.701
Hold us down
on the Amber-alert vehicle.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.171
- Copy that.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.272
- Step away.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.740
I need everyone to
move away from the car.

31:51.543 --> 31:54.180
21-13.
Vehicle appears to be empty.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.714
- Ten-four.

31:55.714 --> 32:00.052
[indistinct chatter]

32:00.052 --> 32:01.553
Sergeant Voight,
we're here with the car.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.255
It's empty.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.024
- All right,
we're almost to you.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.725
- Roman.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.698
Hey. Hey!

32:12.698 --> 32:14.033
Don't move!
Chicago Police!

32:14.033 --> 32:15.801
Don't move!

32:17.003 --> 32:20.039
[tires screeching]

32:25.144 --> 32:27.146
- Where are they?
[gunshots]

32:27.146 --> 32:28.147
Go!

32:28.147 --> 32:29.715
Go! Go!

32:29.715 --> 32:30.749
[people screaming]

32:30.749 --> 32:32.918
Look out!
Get out of the way!

32:32.918 --> 32:35.021
Go!

32:36.288 --> 32:40.392
[people screaming]

32:40.392 --> 32:42.894
- Out of the way! Police!
- Get out of the way!

32:42.894 --> 32:44.096
- Chicago Police!
[tires screeching]

32:44.096 --> 32:45.697
- Get out of the park, now!

32:45.697 --> 32:46.765
- Get out of the way!
- Move!

32:46.765 --> 32:48.900
- Hollister!
Hollister, stop!

32:48.900 --> 32:51.370
Stop right there!

32:51.370 --> 32:53.172
Just Take it easy.

33:05.084 --> 33:05.184
.

33:10.856 --> 33:11.857
- He's cleared the park out.
He's looking to die today.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.661
- Let me talk to him.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.229
- SORT and the negotiator
are two minutes out.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.664
It's safer that way.
- No, no, no.

33:18.664 --> 33:22.134
I can talk sense into him.
I'll bring that boy back.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.236
- Go ahead.
- Lincoln 15-21 emergency.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.971
This is Detective Erin Lindsay
with Intelligence.

33:25.971 --> 33:29.141
I need that chopper
out of the sky now.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.177
- I'm Detective Dawson.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.912
Why don't you drop that weapon,
Mr. Hollister, and let's talk?

33:33.912 --> 33:36.248
- You ain't the man
I need to talk to.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.084
- I know. You want to talk
to Damien Boyd,

33:38.084 --> 33:39.485
but I can't allow that.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.952
- You know what he did.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.490
- I know what you think he did,
but you're making a mistake.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.258
He wasn't there.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.694
You got an innocent man's child
in your hands.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.698
- No, no, either he's lying,
or you are.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.566
- It's the truth!

33:54.566 --> 33:56.868
Now, look,
I got two dozen officers here

33:56.868 --> 33:58.237
that would love to take you out.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.772
Let's not give them a reason.
- They let him die!

34:00.772 --> 34:04.776
Left him under a house
like he wasn't a person.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.748
He bled out all night--

34:09.748 --> 34:11.783
a little kid!

34:11.783 --> 34:15.121
They took away
the only beautiful thing

34:15.121 --> 34:17.123
I ever had in my life.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.690
- I know.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.928
Nothing you do is gonna bring
your boy back.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.531
But you can end
this story today,

34:25.531 --> 34:26.931
or you can use that gun
in your hand

34:26.931 --> 34:28.766
and drag another family
into tragedy.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.601
It's up to you.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.603
Come on.

34:38.677 --> 34:43.482
Conner, he's gonna let you go.
Can you run to me?

34:43.482 --> 34:44.815
- I can't let him win!

34:44.815 --> 34:47.386
- There aren't
any winners here.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.420
It's over.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.857
He doesn't deserve this.
Toss the piece.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.759
Come on, Kurt,
let him go.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.235
It's okay.
Get down.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.236
- Antonio!

35:04.236 --> 35:06.205
[gunshot, boy whimpers]

35:08.774 --> 35:11.477
Antonio, you okay?
- Yeah.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.479
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.547
- Lincoln 15-21.
Shots fired by the police.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.217
Offender down.
Tender-age child in custody.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.286
Notify the Coroner...

35:54.953 --> 35:56.955
- I was robbed.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.493
You know, now would be
a great time

36:01.493 --> 36:05.030
for you to try
to be my dad, but...

36:05.030 --> 36:08.700
I mean, that ship sailed
a long time ago, right?

36:08.700 --> 36:11.303
Look, I really don't need
a lecture right now, okay?

36:11.303 --> 36:14.406
I just need 100 bucks.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.975
- All right,
you want my money.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.611
You want my money.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.147
Okay, here...

36:24.316 --> 36:25.584
Go ahead.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.726
Good luck.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.495
- [scoffs]

36:39.831 --> 36:42.868
- [exhales deeply]

36:45.437 --> 36:48.474
- [sobbing]

37:02.921 --> 37:04.756
Listen, I wasn't there
for you before.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.426
I'm--I'm trying here.

37:07.426 --> 37:10.862
You want to let me try.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.798
Things'll be a lot better.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.469
Trust me.

37:22.374 --> 37:25.411
- So what's it called,
like, officially?

37:25.411 --> 37:29.315
- Officially, it's called
acute myelogenous leukemia.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.716
They don't want
the dad's bone marrow,

37:30.716 --> 37:32.418
for obvious reasons.

37:32.418 --> 37:35.487
- You mean because he drove his
truck through their living room?

37:35.487 --> 37:37.456
- That's a contributing factor.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.726
I stay in touch,

37:40.726 --> 37:42.894
make sure the restraining
order's working out.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.431
- She's pretty.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.567
Boy, you have some taste
for high drama.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.670
- Natural-born
storyteller.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.605
- I can't believe
you were a match.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.808
- It's my mutt blood--
half Irish, half everything.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.577
Guess I'm a match
for anybody.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.846
- Well, I'll bear
that in mind.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.348
- My limp and low energy--

38:02.348 --> 38:04.916
it's the shots I give myself
for the procedure.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.453
I didn't say it, 'cause I'm not
doing this for me.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.987
I don't need a gold star,

38:08.987 --> 38:10.922
and I don't need Platt
or the Ivory Tower knowing,

38:10.922 --> 38:12.491
in case they try
to talk me out of this

38:12.491 --> 38:15.694
or, you know,
suspend me.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.930
That kid...

38:18.930 --> 38:20.666
he's dying,

38:20.666 --> 38:24.370
and that--
that didn't seem fair.

38:24.370 --> 38:27.406
- Sean Roman,
you're gonna make me cry.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.708
- Nah, you're fine.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.877
Come on,
let's say hi.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.446
He calls you
"the pretty policewoman"--

38:34.446 --> 38:36.382
little flirt.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.385
Hey, Andrew,
I want you to meet someone.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.561
- My name is Barbara Fletcher.
I'd like to report a crime--

38:49.561 --> 38:51.129
false testimony

38:51.129 --> 38:53.465
fabricated
by a Sergeant Hank Voight

38:53.465 --> 38:55.967
on May 6, 2001.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.136
He put a man away
for a murder

38:58.136 --> 39:01.006
I personally know
he could not have witnessed.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.074
I want Sergeant Voight's badge,

39:03.074 --> 39:07.078
and I want him put in jail,
where he belongs.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.216
- So Lindsay's back, just...

39:11.216 --> 39:13.018
[snaps fingers]
Like that.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.954
- No, not like that.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.424
- What's it like?

39:18.424 --> 39:20.091
- I don't know.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.630
I don't know what
hand gesture to make.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.433
She's back,
and it's good.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.436
And we'll see
what that means for me...

39:30.436 --> 39:32.137
and for both of us.

39:32.137 --> 39:35.907
[rock music playing,
indistinct chatter]

39:35.907 --> 39:40.245
- Hey, man, heard you guys
caught a nasty one today.

39:40.245 --> 39:44.550
- It wasn't pretty,
but we saved a kid.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.317
- Yeah, I heard that too.

39:46.317 --> 39:49.788
This one's on me, huh?
Na zdorovie.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.661
Oh, you owe me a vodka.
Oh!

39:55.661 --> 39:58.564
[cell phone vibrates]
- [chuckles]

39:58.564 --> 40:00.466
It's my son.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.768
[cell phone beeps]

40:02.768 --> 40:04.936
Little man,
what's up?

40:04.936 --> 40:06.938
- You called before?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.440
- Yeah, I wanted
to hear your voice.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.609
[whistle blows]

40:10.609 --> 40:12.911
What's that?
You watching the game?

40:12.911 --> 40:15.614
- Yeah, fourth quarter.
It's tied.

40:15.614 --> 40:17.883
- Tie game?

40:17.883 --> 40:20.486
Want to do
a little play-by-play?

40:20.486 --> 40:23.822
- Just for you?
- Just for me.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.924
- Well, there's five seconds
left in the game,

40:25.924 --> 40:27.959
and we're
on the 10-yard line.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.029
All we got to do is kick
a field goal, and we win.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.898
The offense breaks
the huddle--

40:32.898 --> 40:35.366
Oh, no! The other team called
a time-out, Dad.

40:35.366 --> 40:36.568
The crowd's going crazy.
