Thanks, honey.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.400
Hi, Ma. Want some dinner?

00:57.467 --> 00:59.266
Forget dinner.
Listen up, everybody.

00:59.333 --> 01:01.433
I've got something here

01:01.500 --> 01:04.266
that'll make you scream, holler,
and jump for joy.

01:04.333 --> 01:05.900
Are the batteries included?

01:13.000 --> 01:17.734
We're all going to be contestants
on <i>Grab That Dough.</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:19.433
<i>Grab That Dough, </i>Ma!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.500
You mean that ridiculous game show

01:21.567 --> 01:24.800
where people humiliate
themselves for a lousy dollar?

01:24.867 --> 01:28.000
-That's the one.
-Oh!

01:28.066 --> 01:30.667
-I don't believe it.
-We'll be on TV?

01:30.734 --> 01:32.900
I've worked six months for this.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.900
<i>Grab That Dough</i>
is my favorite game show.

01:35.967 --> 01:39.867
Oh, mine too. And I think guy Corbin
is the cutest host on TV.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.533
He's like Jean Raver and
Chuck Lorry and Bob Eubanks

01:42.600 --> 01:43.467
all rolled into one.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.233
That's an awful lot of teeth
and polyester.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.767
When are we going on?

01:49.834 --> 01:51.667
We tape tomorrow in Hollywood.

01:51.734 --> 01:53.900
You're kidding!
Hollywood, California?

01:53.967 --> 01:56.467
No, Rose. Hollywood
on the planet Romulac.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.433
Wait a minute.
What do you mean tomorrow?

02:01.500 --> 02:02.700
That's what these tickets say.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.500
They have to give us
more time than that.

02:04.567 --> 02:08.734
These tickets were sent
out four months ago.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.500
You gave them the wrong address.

02:11.567 --> 02:15.300
Oh, yeah. Here it is.
My old address from Sicily.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.200
"2 miles west of Palermo,
underneath the old bridge".

02:22.100 --> 02:23.900
You lived under a bridge?

02:23.967 --> 02:26.433
Yeah. We were wealthy.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.667
Most people didn't have
a bridge to live under.

02:29.734 --> 02:33.133
Well, isn't that a shame?
We won't be able to go.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.500
Why not? You have a pressing
engagement with a cheesecake?

02:37.567 --> 02:39.100
There's money involved here.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.734
You know what, girls?
She's right.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.166
We could catch the red eye,
be in Hollywood tomorrow morning,

02:45.233 --> 02:48.100
and tomorrow afternoon be ready
to...

02:48.166 --> 02:51.633
(all) Grab that dough!

02:51.700 --> 02:54.333
Grab that dough!

03:04.600 --> 03:08.567
I can't believe that stupid airline
lost our luggage. Now what?

03:08.633 --> 03:10.300
Ask Blanche. She's the expert

03:10.367 --> 03:12.834
at checking into hotels
without luggage.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.300
I can't believe somebody stole
my bags.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.266
Don't worry about it.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.700
With the money we'll win,
you can replace everything.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.100
What about my bags?

03:26.166 --> 03:29.900
With your share, you can have
your bags surgically removed.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.567
Let's get some sleep.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.600
Good idea.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.700
Good morning.
How may I help you?

03:39.767 --> 03:43.500
We have two double rooms
reserved under the name Zbornak.

03:43.567 --> 03:46.567
I'm afraid I gave
those two rooms away.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.066
We had a reservation.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.300
Until 3am. You're late.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.700
Therefore the reservation
is null and void.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.834
I'm sorry. Company policy.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.033
Yeah?
I'm from Sicily.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.600
Know what our company policy is?

03:58.667 --> 03:59.734
First, I break your knees.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.633
Ma, Ma.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.433
Forget about the reservation.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.967
Give us two rooms.

04:05.033 --> 04:07.133
I'm afraid we're all booked up.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.533
You give away our rooms,
and now you're booked?

04:10.600 --> 04:11.967
That's correct, madam.

04:12.033 --> 04:13.333
It is?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.467
Hey, I'm pretty sharp
for 3 in the morning.

04:16.934 --> 04:19.200
Let me handle this.

04:19.266 --> 04:22.767
Honey... I don't generally
throw my name around,

04:22.834 --> 04:25.000
but you leave me no choice.

04:25.066 --> 04:28.400
It so happens
that I'm miss Angie Dickinson.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.800
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like two rooms.

04:36.867 --> 04:39.500
You don't look like Angie Dickinson.

04:39.567 --> 04:43.133
I've altered my appearance
for an important movie role.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.734
It's about a woman who eats her
way from behind the iron curtain.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.834
We'd better go to another hotel.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.867
That would be an exercise
in futility.

04:54.934 --> 04:56.767
There's not a vacancy anywhere.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.433
Girls, this is terrible.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.333
We're going to be on
national television in seven hours.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.333
We don't have clothes or rooms.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.433
I sympathize with your problem.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.900
For $75,
you can sleep in the lobby

05:10.967 --> 05:12.700
and not be arrested for loitering.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.400
$75? That's a lot of money.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.333
I know, ma'am.
That's why I want it.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.367
Oh.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.133
Gee, this is just great.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.500
This whole night
has been nothing but fun.

05:30.834 --> 05:34.333
You really need to get out more,
Rose.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.433
Come on, Dorothy.
Admit you're having fun.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.734
It's like having an adventure.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.900
An adventure,
my foot!

05:41.967 --> 05:43.367
It's like a nightmare.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.200
We're going on television
in clothes we slept in all night.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.900
We'll look like hell,
be exhausted,

05:49.967 --> 05:51.967
and won't know any answers.

05:52.033 --> 05:54.934
Would you stop complaining?
We've got it easy.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.734
The show
I did in Sicily was torture.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.000
What was it called?

05:59.066 --> 06:01.166
I just told you,
<i>Torture.</i>

06:02.633 --> 06:04.266
Mussolini asked the questions,

06:04.333 --> 06:06.433
and you'd better have
the right answers.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.066
Things like, "Who do you
like better, me or Hitler?"

06:12.667 --> 06:14.700
"Who's got the snappiest boots,
me or Hitler?"

06:15.867 --> 06:18.767
"Who's got the cuter girlfriend,
me or Hitler?"

06:18.834 --> 06:21.667
And you always had to answer
"Mussolini."

06:21.734 --> 06:24.734
Otherwise they forced you to play
the lightning round.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.066
They used real lightning.

06:27.133 --> 06:29.300
Ma, you're making this up.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.500
Like hell I did.

06:30.567 --> 06:33.433
Goodson-Todman
brought it to the States

06:33.500 --> 06:35.433
and called it <i>Tattletales.</i>

06:36.734 --> 06:39.300
Now, count your blessings.
Good night.

06:57.867 --> 07:03.934
Oh, Fernando, you naughty boy,
not the feather.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.467
Blanche, Blanche wake up,
people are looking.

07:09.533 --> 07:12.200
What? Oh.

07:12.266 --> 07:16.367
Oh, I'm sorry. I think
I was having an erotic dream.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.734
You know, your father used
to do a thing with feathers

07:20.800 --> 07:22.100
when we were first married.

07:23.066 --> 07:24.834
But he was too lazy to pull
them off the chicken

07:24.900 --> 07:26.600
so I put an end to that.

07:28.867 --> 07:30.800
Ma, listen, next time
you have an urge

07:30.867 --> 07:34.934
to stroll down memory lane
do me a favor, go by yourself.

07:36.734 --> 07:39.166
What time are we supposed to be
at the studio, Sophia?

07:39.233 --> 07:41.533
I don't know,
I have to check the tickets

07:41.600 --> 07:43.633
hand me my purse, Dorothy.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.734
I don't have your purse,
wait a minute, you had mine.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.667
I gave them to you.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.333
Hold everything I think
my purse is missing too.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.066
So is mine.

07:52.133 --> 07:54.166
Girls, you know what this means?

07:54.233 --> 07:56.500
Somebody snuck in here
while we were asleep--

07:56.567 --> 07:58.700
(all)
And grabbed our dough.

08:06.033 --> 08:08.533
I'm sorry, ladies,
but without a description

08:08.600 --> 08:11.233
there is absolutely
nothing we can do.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.367
But if you remember anything,
give me a call.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.100
How about
if I just wanna say, "hello"?

08:19.400 --> 08:22.934
Dorothy, I'm in the ladies room,
look at my brazier,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.567
what do you think I find?

08:24.633 --> 08:27.900
Hopefully what we all find
when we look at our braziers.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.467
Please,
I haven't been able to find those

08:31.533 --> 08:32.800
since I nursed your brother phil.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.734
But I did find the tickets
to the game show.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.133
-Sophia!
-You're kidding?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.900
I forgot I put them
there for safe keeping.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.767
Oh, Ma, I could just kiss you.

08:45.834 --> 08:48.633
Not until we locate a toothbrush,
okay?

08:51.934 --> 08:54.567
Well, it is high time something
went right on this trip.

08:54.633 --> 08:57.633
Now all we have to do is figure
out a way to get to the studio.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.700
We can always walk.
It's only 39 blocks.

09:00.767 --> 09:03.300
If we start right now,
we can still get there in time.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.100
I have a better idea.
We can hitchhike.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.800
I can lift up my skirt, like, you
know, in that Clark Gable movie,

09:07.867 --> 09:10.033
<i>It happened one night.</i>
Boy, we'll have a ride in no time.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.533
Please, you lift up your skirt

09:12.600 --> 09:15.800
and someone might mistake your thigh
for the on-ramp to the freeway.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.066
Let's hit it.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.100
Hello.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.800
Wow. Aren't you Tiffany Blane,

09:37.867 --> 09:39.233
the lady on <i>Grab That Dough</i>

09:39.300 --> 09:42.967
who stands in front of stuff
and does this?

09:43.033 --> 09:44.266
Yes, I am.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.967
How do you do?
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

09:47.033 --> 09:51.100
This is my mother Sophia Petrillo
and friends Rose and Blanche.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.066
We're competing on today's show.

09:54.133 --> 09:57.900
Hello, Tiffany. It's such a pleasure
to meet you, honey.

09:57.967 --> 10:00.700
You know,
I thought those pictures of you

10:00.767 --> 10:04.967
in that sleazy girlie magazine
were so tastefully done.

10:06.033 --> 10:09.033
Was that a real English Bobby

10:09.100 --> 10:11.066
spanking you there
in front of Big Ben?

10:12.867 --> 10:16.266
Now, ladies, would you like to meet
the other contestants?

10:16.333 --> 10:18.567
Look. Look. There's Guy Corbin.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.567
Oh, what a hunk.

10:21.633 --> 10:24.567
Oh, that man makes my Ovaltine boil.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.800
Good morning.
Welcome to our show.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.333
I'm Guy Corbin,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.300
and I've arranged something
especially for you,

10:33.367 --> 10:36.333
fresh ground coffee
and prune danish.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.867
Tiffany, tell them all about it
right now.

10:38.934 --> 10:39.900
Okay.

10:42.834 --> 10:45.500
Could I have a word
with you a minute?

10:45.567 --> 10:46.367
Of course.

10:46.433 --> 10:49.800
I've been talking to those other two
contestants, the Kaplan brothers.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.367
I've learned
some interesting things.

10:52.433 --> 10:55.867
They've won over $40,000
in cash and prizes

10:55.934 --> 10:57.333
on various game shows.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.934
You and I should
team up with them.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.700
Oh, Blanche, that's impossible.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.667
That would mean
dumping ma and Rose.

11:04.734 --> 11:07.800
It's a terrible thing to do.
I feel awful even thinking about it.

11:07.867 --> 11:12.000
But if we team up with Fred and Willard
we stand a much better chance of winning.

11:12.066 --> 11:15.000
I'm shocked
you'd even suggest such a thing.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.900
Dorothy, your mother
and Rose are dead weight.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.533
Let us cut them loose
before they drag us down.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.600
You expect me to betray one
of my dearest friends

11:27.667 --> 11:31.200
and my own mother
to win a few extra dollars?

11:31.266 --> 11:33.033
-Yes.
-Ok, I'll do it.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.500
All right, everyone.

11:36.567 --> 11:39.934
We're about to go on the air.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.400
Let's divide up into teams.

11:42.467 --> 11:46.100
Remember to jump up and down
and scream a lot.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.300
Come on, Dorothy. We're on.

11:47.367 --> 11:50.967
There's something
you ought to know.

11:51.033 --> 11:53.567
Dorothy and I are going to team up
with the Kaplan brothers.

11:53.633 --> 11:56.100
The Kaplan brothers?
You mean you and Dorothy

11:56.166 --> 11:58.300
are joining a country western band?

11:59.900 --> 12:03.033
That's the Gatlin brothers, Rose.

12:03.100 --> 12:05.767
The Kaplan brothers are those
gentlemen standing right there.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.367
You're dumping me and Rose
for those two yutzes?

12:08.433 --> 12:12.633
Believe me, if we split up,

12:12.700 --> 12:15.333
we double our chances
of going home with something.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.033
Cut the bull!

12:18.867 --> 12:21.133
You don't want us
'cause you think we're too stupid.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.233
(man) 30 seconds.
Take your places, please.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.433
Don't be mad, Ma.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.433
Get bent.
We'll cream you.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.867
Yeah.

12:29.934 --> 12:31.867
We're going to maul you.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.800
-We'll beat you into the ground.
-Yeah.

12:34.867 --> 12:39.000
I'll give Rose and $50 for
your dumbest Kaplan brother.

12:49.066 --> 12:53.934
<i>It's time to play </i>Grab That Dough
<i>with your host Guy Corbin!</i>

12:57.166 --> 12:58.867
Thank you.
Hello, everybody.

12:58.934 --> 13:00.834
Welcome to
<i>Grab That Dough,</i>

13:00.900 --> 13:03.433
where all you really
need to know to win

13:03.500 --> 13:05.100
is how to make a fist.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.767
Let's meet our lucky contestants.

13:07.834 --> 13:10.767
First we have
Dorothy Zbornak,

13:10.834 --> 13:13.667
an English teacher
originally from Brooklyn.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.834
She now lives in Miami
with her mother

13:15.900 --> 13:19.133
who will gladly pay anyone
who will take her out for a date.

13:26.133 --> 13:30.633
Our second contestant is an artist
with an incredible body.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.667
She runs her own museum,
speaks Chinese,

13:33.734 --> 13:37.400
and hopes to sail around the world
before she turns 40.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.433
Wow. That must be a typo.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.700
Welcome Blanche Devereaux.

13:46.900 --> 13:50.567
Our next two contestants are
brothers from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

13:50.633 --> 13:54.100
Blanche, that entire introduction
was nothing but lies.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.400
I know, and they just loved it.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.033
Did you hear that applause?

13:58.100 --> 14:00.233
That's all you care about,
money and applause?

14:00.300 --> 14:03.033
And sex.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.266
For which I generally get applause.

14:08.834 --> 14:11.633
Our next contestant
is a family counselor.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.133
She originally hails
from St. Olaf, Minnesota

14:14.200 --> 14:17.867
where she was voted "The girl
most likely to get stuck in a tuba."

14:17.934 --> 14:20.166
Welcome, Rose Nylund!

14:23.667 --> 14:25.300
And last, but not least,

14:25.367 --> 14:29.266
is a grandmother of six,
Sophia Petrillo.

14:29.333 --> 14:33.500
Sophia, it says here that you and
Dorothy are mother and daughter.

14:33.567 --> 14:36.033
Rose is my daughter now,

14:36.100 --> 14:37.867
and you, Dorothy, are the biggest
disappointment

14:37.934 --> 14:40.133
to hit the streets
since the AMC Pacer.

14:46.100 --> 14:49.800
Say, it's time to play
<i>Grab That Dough!</i>

14:49.867 --> 14:51.533
Hands on buzzers.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.433
Let's begin with our
trivia lightning round.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.367
What famous Tennessee Williams play

14:57.433 --> 15:00.667
was recently made
into a film by Paul Newman?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.367
-Willard.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.467
-Rose.
-Was it <i>The Glass Menagerie?</i>

15:07.533 --> 15:09.433
Correct for 100 points!

15:12.767 --> 15:17.533
What innovative industrialist
invented the assembly line?

15:17.600 --> 15:20.266
-Willard.
-I'm sorry. I did it again.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.400
-Sophia.
-Henry ford.

15:23.467 --> 15:25.000
That's correct!

15:27.934 --> 15:30.300
For another 100 points,

15:30.367 --> 15:32.567
who is the current
secretary of State?

15:34.600 --> 15:37.166
-Willard.
-Charles Schultz.

15:42.033 --> 15:45.133
He created <i>Peanuts.</i>

15:45.200 --> 15:47.433
I thought that was
George Washington Carver.

15:49.834 --> 15:52.967
Willard, don't ever
touch your buzzer again.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.166
Rose.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.834
Is the correct answer
George Schultz?

16:00.900 --> 16:02.667
That's correct!

16:02.734 --> 16:04.333
Rose is on a roll.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.433
The blue team's
leading 300 to nothing.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
All right!

16:08.567 --> 16:11.300
-Oh, shut up, Nylund.
-You shut up.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.400
Why don't you both shut up
and answer this next question.

16:16.533 --> 16:20.500
For 100 points,
complete this famous saying,

16:20.567 --> 16:21.967
"Better late than..."

16:22.767 --> 16:24.333
-Blanche.
-Pregnant.

16:31.367 --> 16:35.100
That's incorrect,
but certainly not untrue.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.467
-Rose.
-Guy.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.266
Is it "better late than never"?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.400
Right you are, Rose.

16:46.066 --> 16:47.533
(bell rings)

16:47.600 --> 16:50.734
That signals the end
of the trivia lightning round.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.300
Blue team leads with 400 points,

16:53.367 --> 16:58.400
while green team trails
with a big, fat 0.

16:58.467 --> 17:01.500
We'll be right back to spin
the big money wheel

17:01.567 --> 17:03.934
after this commercial message.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.400
-(man) We're clear!
-Thanks.

17:07.934 --> 17:11.767
How does it feel
to have "a big, fat 0"?

17:11.834 --> 17:13.100
We'll catch up.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.166
I wasn't talking
about your score.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.033
I was talking
about your partner.

17:18.533 --> 17:19.934
We're too dumb, huh?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.500
We'll whip your hinnies.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.600
The game's not over, Nylund.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.834
-It is for you, Devereaux.
-Five seconds.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.000
Come on.

17:30.033 --> 17:33.433
<i>Once again, here's Guy Corbin!</i>

17:33.500 --> 17:35.300
Thank you very much.

17:36.734 --> 17:37.533
Welcome back.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.000
It's time to spin the big money
wheel on <i>Grab That Dough.</i>

17:41.066 --> 17:43.066
Spinners, mosey on down.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.834
We'll start with Blanche
from the green team.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.500
Blanche, show us your stuff.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.600
You first, Mr. Game show host.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.033
Blanche, spin the wheel.

17:59.934 --> 18:03.967
You are landing on...
"grab that dough"!

18:08.033 --> 18:10.900
"Grab that dough."

18:10.967 --> 18:13.300
-You know what that means?
-Yeah. We're shafted.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.166
That's right, Sophia.

18:15.233 --> 18:19.700
The green team automatically
wins a chance to grab that dough

18:19.767 --> 18:21.300
in our magic money machine.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.633
Come this way.

18:23.834 --> 18:28.100
Green team, you'll have 15 seconds
to grab as much money as you can.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.667
Who'll grab?

18:29.734 --> 18:31.533
I'll grab today, Guy.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.033
You ought to make quite a haul
with those meat hooks.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.033
Tiffany,
let's have our big money smock,

18:39.100 --> 18:41.100
and the big money goggles.

18:43.934 --> 18:48.000
You need to grab $500
to beat the blue team

18:48.066 --> 18:51.700
and get a chance at what's
behind the window. Ready?

18:59.066 --> 19:02.867
She's all ready to grab that dough!

19:09.266 --> 19:11.700
Oh, Dorothy, Dorothy,
Dorothy, Dorothy!

19:17.066 --> 19:19.734
Get some more!
Get some more!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.834
-(bell rings)
-Oh, time's up!

19:22.700 --> 19:26.033
Oh, let's see how she did.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.934
Help her out.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.533
Ok, Dorothy,
let's see how you did.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.133
100,

19:33.200 --> 19:34.600
200, 300,

19:34.667 --> 19:36.900
400, 500,

19:36.967 --> 19:40.767
6... 7... 8...

19:40.834 --> 19:42.700
$900!

19:42.767 --> 19:45.100
And the green team makes
a miraculous comeback

19:45.166 --> 19:47.633
and wins the game!

19:47.700 --> 19:49.200
We're winners!

19:49.266 --> 19:52.367
Oh, blue team, we don't want you
to go away empty-handed.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.734
You have $400.
That's $100 apiece.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.667
You have the home version
of <i>Grab That Dough</i>

19:58.734 --> 20:00.900
which attaches
to any vacuum cleaner.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.233
-Thank you for being with us.
-Cram it, piano teeth.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.800
Now, green team,
what are you going to do

20:10.867 --> 20:12.166
with all that dough?

20:12.233 --> 20:15.266
Are you going to keep it
or trade it

20:15.333 --> 20:17.533
for what's behind
one of our windows?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.033
Let's go for the window.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.400
We have to discuss this
with everyone.

20:22.467 --> 20:25.600
Ok. We're going for the window.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.900
Will you take window 1...

20:29.033 --> 20:33.867
window 2...
or window 3?

20:35.967 --> 20:37.133
Window 3, Guy.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.200
All right.
Let's see what you didn't pick.

20:40.266 --> 20:42.300
Behind window 1,

20:42.367 --> 20:45.233
brand new living room furniture!

20:45.300 --> 20:48.200
Retail price for this
magnificent prize

20:48.266 --> 20:51.967
$12,000.
But that's not what you picked.

20:52.033 --> 20:55.033
Thanks for pointing that out, Guy.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.600
You're welcome, Dorothy.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.834
Let's look behind window 2.

20:58.900 --> 21:03.233
-It's... a brand-new car!
-Oh!

21:03.300 --> 21:07.166
Yes, it's that beautiful sports car
you've always dreamed of.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.700
Retail price, $23,000.

21:11.367 --> 21:14.467
Now, Dorothy, Blanche,
Willard, and Fred...

21:15.233 --> 21:18.066
it's time to see what you did pick.
Are you ready?

21:18.133 --> 21:19.600
We're ready.
We're ready.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.166
Because have I
got something for you.

21:22.233 --> 21:25.600
A brand-new
electric skillet!

21:28.266 --> 21:29.834
A what?

21:29.900 --> 21:32.600
An electric skillet from Fry Kwik.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.266
It not only fries.
It boils. It bakes--

21:35.333 --> 21:36.533
It stinks.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.900
My apologies
to the Fry Kwik corporation.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.900
Green team,
we're not finished yet.

21:43.967 --> 21:46.600
You need something
to go in that skillet.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.200
We won a car!

21:48.266 --> 21:50.767
No. A lifetime supply of soup!

21:52.800 --> 21:54.934
Yes, it's soup, soup,
and more soup.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.166
Every kind you can imagine. It's
yours for the rest of your lifetime.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.734
That's our show for today.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.800
Come on down and give
a <i>Grab That Dough</i> goodbye.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.867
Goodbye, everybody!

22:25.867 --> 22:27.467
Thank goodness we're home.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.367
That's the worst trip
I've ever been on.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.166
How can you say that?

22:31.233 --> 22:34.567
How can she say that?
We lost our luggage.

22:34.633 --> 22:38.066
We slept in a hotel lobby.
Our purses were stolen.

22:38.133 --> 22:40.200
We won zippo on the show.

22:40.266 --> 22:43.667
But we made up on the plane.

22:43.734 --> 22:46.533
It was nothing else to do.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.367
It was that or watch
<i>Three Amigos</i> with a headset.

22:50.433 --> 22:55.066
I'm going to forget all about this
while soaking in a warm tub.

22:55.133 --> 22:58.233
Me too.
We only have one tub.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.233
I get the deep end.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.633
Rose! Rose!

23:05.333 --> 23:06.600
Oh, ma.

23:07.533 --> 23:10.500
Ma, you're still mad at me,
aren't you?

23:10.567 --> 23:13.500
Dorothy, you let greed
cloud your judgment.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.033
Money blinded you.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.767
You turned your back
on the people you love.

23:17.834 --> 23:21.133
You did a terrible thing.
It's unforgivable.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.800
Won't anything
I do make it up to you?

23:25.300 --> 23:27.133
-Give me $100.
-Make it 50.

23:28.734 --> 23:30.100
Done. I love you.

23:44.033 --> 23:47.066
(theme music playing)
