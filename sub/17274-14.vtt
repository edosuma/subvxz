You think Tony was murdered?

00:02.906 --> 00:04.266
He wouldn't drink
himself to death.

00:04.324 --> 00:05.791
- Who would want that?
- Belenko.

00:05.909 --> 00:07.543
There's a pattern
to his attacks.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.795
Each one killed a guy
from my unit.

00:09.913 --> 00:11.964
First, Charlie Schinderman
in Chicago,

00:12.081 --> 00:14.750
then Mueller, which was based
on false Intel fed to us,

00:14.884 --> 00:16.135
and he had Tony poisoned.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.586
Auggie, you could be next.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

00:26.262 --> 00:28.931
I know you're not Interpol.

00:29.098 --> 00:31.984
We are on the same side.

00:32.101 --> 00:34.102
Start talking now.

00:34.270 --> 00:35.821
Where's Auggie Anderson?

00:35.939 --> 00:38.907
I'm not afraid to suffer,
and I'm not afraid to die.

00:38.992 --> 00:41.160
I wonder if your friend
can say the same.

00:41.277 --> 00:43.028
Are you saying
he's still alive?

00:43.163 --> 00:44.613
For now.

00:44.781 --> 00:47.032
There was a tracking device
in his mouth.

[Silenced gunshots]

00:49.285 --> 00:51.753
Aah!

00:51.871 --> 00:53.191
It turns out
our Georgian diplomat

00:53.206 --> 00:54.506
isn't from Georgia after all.

00:54.624 --> 00:56.625
He's from Grozny, Chechnya.

00:56.793 --> 00:59.044
We believe that's
where he was taking Auggie.

00:59.179 --> 01:03.465
Auggie's unit was deployed
to Grozny on several occasions.

01:03.633 --> 01:05.934
I've been waiting for you.

01:06.052 --> 01:07.686
Why'd you bring me out here?

01:07.804 --> 01:09.638
Because you have something
I want.

01:15.228 --> 01:17.913
No! No!

01:18.047 --> 01:20.816
[Door slams]

01:47.343 --> 01:48.927
Hello, Mr. Anderson.

01:54.817 --> 01:56.685
Let's get started, shall we?

02:08.181 --> 02:14.104
I had Belenko, and I lost him,

02:14.189 --> 02:16.830
and now he's got Auggie.

02:16.947 --> 02:20.250
We have to find him,
and nothing is gonna stop us.

02:31.929 --> 02:34.047
Joan, I just got word
from Annie

02:34.215 --> 02:36.182
they're an hour south
of the Kazbegi border crossing.

02:36.267 --> 02:38.051
Great.
Let me know when they through.

02:38.185 --> 02:39.936
Yeah, and I've also gone
over all the mission files

02:40.054 --> 02:42.134
from Auggie's time with
Special Activities Division--

02:42.223 --> 02:43.556
seven Ops in Grozny.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.775
Any one of them
could be connected to Belenko.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.060
Anything stand out?

02:47.194 --> 02:48.561
Well, I've cross-referenced
all the names

02:48.646 --> 02:51.231
I could dig up tied to the Ops,
and everything's coming up zero.

02:51.365 --> 02:53.066
I mean,
even the FSB's file on Belenko

02:53.234 --> 02:54.314
doesn't have his real name.

02:54.368 --> 02:55.902
So I'm gonna run through
our database

02:56.036 --> 02:57.153
for known aliases again

02:57.288 --> 02:59.572
and make sure
I didn't miss anything.

02:59.707 --> 03:00.707
Yeah.

03:00.791 --> 03:02.659
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

03:02.793 --> 03:03.827
I-I can't sleep.

03:03.911 --> 03:04.994
There's--there's too much to do,

03:05.129 --> 03:07.046
and I'm not gonna
leave it to anyone else.

03:07.164 --> 03:09.833
I mean, it's Auggie.

03:09.967 --> 03:11.551
[Speaking Russian]

03:11.635 --> 03:12.669
No, no, no, no.

03:12.753 --> 03:14.587
I can't.

03:14.755 --> 03:16.172
Yeah.

03:16.307 --> 03:18.475
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>
Anything yet?

03:18.592 --> 03:19.893
I burned through my Rolodex

03:19.977 --> 03:21.678
calling
old eastern bloc contacts,

03:21.812 --> 03:23.897
and either Belenko has a lot
of friends or a lot of money.

03:24.014 --> 03:25.932
No one is talking.
I don't get it.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.902
The guy's Chechen
posing as a Georgian diplomat.

03:29.019 --> 03:30.770
Why are the Russians
willing to hide him?

03:30.905 --> 03:33.606
He must have something
on someone inside the Kremlin

03:33.774 --> 03:35.275
or the FSB or both.

03:35.409 --> 03:36.609
Well, you can't leverage
people forever.

03:36.694 --> 03:37.944
Eventually they'll turn on you.

03:38.112 --> 03:39.746
And that's
when we'll get him.

03:39.864 --> 03:41.748
You feel like taking a break
from your calls?

03:41.866 --> 03:43.950
You'd be very valuable
in my next meeting.

03:44.118 --> 03:45.535
You don't even have to ask.

03:45.669 --> 03:48.087
Joan, Arthur, please meet
commander Richard Wheeler.

03:48.205 --> 03:50.757
He's in charge of SEAL team 8.
Nice to meet you.

03:50.841 --> 03:52.175
Nice to meet you both.

03:52.293 --> 03:54.177
Commander Wheeler is here
to liaise with our operation.

03:54.295 --> 03:57.046
As soon as we have confirmation
of Auggie's location,

03:57.181 --> 03:59.015
his team is going
to handle the extraction.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.467
We're very grateful for
your help, commander Wheeler.

04:01.602 --> 04:03.970
Auggie Anderson's a dear friend
to everyone here.

04:04.054 --> 04:05.972
Well, we'll do
whatever we can to get him back.

04:06.106 --> 04:07.807
Let's have Patrick
get you down to the DPD,

04:07.942 --> 04:10.860
get your team situated.
Okay. Thanks.

04:10.978 --> 04:14.147
Thank you.

04:14.315 --> 04:17.200
- Thoughts on our Navy man?
- Wheeler's good.

04:17.317 --> 04:20.119
He's kept himself out of
operations, though, for a while.

04:20.237 --> 04:22.155
- Any reason?
- Not officially.

04:22.289 --> 04:25.491
But he was on the <i> U.S.S. Cole</i>
when it was attacked in Yemen.

04:25.659 --> 04:28.127
We lost a lot
of good men that day.

04:28.212 --> 04:29.662
One of them was his son.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.002
Ugh!

04:36.170 --> 04:39.839
Shall I continue, or are you
feeling a little more talkative?

04:40.007 --> 04:42.091
Oh, why talk now?

04:42.226 --> 04:44.978
I'm just starting
to enjoy this.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.730
I'm glad you still have
a sense of humor.

04:47.848 --> 04:50.433
You said I have something
you want.

04:50.568 --> 04:52.318
Are you gonna tell me
what that is?

04:52.436 --> 04:55.438
[Chuckles]

04:55.573 --> 05:00.193
Someone's starting
to lose their patience.

05:00.327 --> 05:03.529
That means you're going
to break soon.

05:03.614 --> 05:06.499
Oh, you're awfully confident.

05:06.617 --> 05:10.203
You're not the first person
I've interrogated,

05:10.371 --> 05:14.007
but since you asked,
I'm looking for some information

05:14.124 --> 05:17.210
about a man.

05:17.344 --> 05:19.345
Well, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

05:19.463 --> 05:22.765
A man you worked
with in Grozny in 2005.

05:22.883 --> 05:24.133
2005?

05:24.268 --> 05:25.802
Mm-hmm.

05:25.936 --> 05:27.553
That was
a long time ago, man.

05:27.721 --> 05:29.555
My memory's a little fuzzy.

05:29.723 --> 05:31.557
His name's James Deckard.

06:25.329 --> 06:27.080
You too, James.
It's been too long.

06:27.197 --> 06:29.165
Were you followed?

06:29.283 --> 06:31.034
Come on, man,
you know me better than that.

06:31.168 --> 06:32.502
Yeah, well, I had to ask.

06:32.619 --> 06:36.789
These guys got me looking over
my shoulder most of the time.

06:36.924 --> 06:38.791
You missed our last couple
meets--did something happen?

06:38.926 --> 06:42.962
Mm. Things have been
touch and go lately.

06:43.047 --> 06:45.715
Everyone in the Chechen
resistance has been on edge

06:45.849 --> 06:48.051
since we captured Mueller.
"We"?

06:48.185 --> 06:51.971
Yeah, live the cover, man.

06:52.139 --> 06:53.973
You doing okay with that?

06:54.108 --> 06:55.391
I mean, you know how it is.

06:55.476 --> 06:59.278
It's like, at first you're like,
"I can handle anything."

06:59.396 --> 07:02.482
You're just playing a role...

07:02.649 --> 07:06.119
But you're not really playing,
you know, you're living.

07:07.654 --> 07:09.489
Yeah, I get it.

07:12.576 --> 07:13.876
Any word on Mueller?

07:13.994 --> 07:15.545
No. I haven't been
able to get close,

07:15.662 --> 07:16.829
but I know these guys.

07:16.964 --> 07:20.166
You don't want to get captured
by them.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.835

07:23.003 --> 07:25.505
to set up a prisoner exchange.

We're offering to give up
Mikhail Kokorin for Mueller.

that you can get

yourself on the team
that's bringing Mueller in?

07:31.678 --> 07:34.514
Already on it,

on the team as well.

- Yeah, I know.

07:43.774 --> 07:45.608
Yeah, you too.

when he'd be back?

13:38.579 --> 13:41.915
We've organized
a prisoner exchange.

13:42.049 --> 13:45.051
I was hoping you were gonna
say, "kill some Chechens."

13:45.136 --> 13:46.920
Sons of bitches
take one of our guys--

13:47.054 --> 13:48.388
Calm down. That's not gonna
get Nathan back.

13:48.472 --> 13:50.840
Coddling the bastards
ain't gonna get him back either.

13:50.975 --> 13:53.426
Only one thing's gonna get
him back...

13:53.561 --> 13:55.145
Mikhail Kokorin.

13:55.262 --> 13:57.180
We hand him
over to the Chechens.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.015
They give us Mueller.

13:59.150 --> 14:01.184
Nobody gets hurt.
What are these?

14:01.318 --> 14:04.270
Protocols, man.

14:04.355 --> 14:07.857
He's never done
a prisoner exchange.

14:07.992 --> 14:09.472
- Not technically.
- Leave Dale alone.

14:09.527 --> 14:11.945
This is how both sides
have agreed to do the exchange.

14:12.079 --> 14:14.519
Now, you guys need to know this
backwards and forwards because

14:14.615 --> 14:16.249
it's only gonna be
the four of us walking Kokorin

14:16.367 --> 14:17.367
into the lion's den.

14:17.451 --> 14:18.785
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:18.953 --> 14:20.253
What about Deckard?
He gonna help us with this?

14:20.371 --> 14:22.038
Yeah, he's gonna be
on the Chechen exchange team.

14:22.123 --> 14:23.423
Good.
So maybe he'll make sure

14:23.541 --> 14:24.874
we don't get
our heads blown off.

14:24.959 --> 14:27.343
Yeah.
Deckard gave me a heads-up.

14:27.461 --> 14:30.930
Our favorite psychopath,
Imran Umarov, is gonna be there.

14:35.970 --> 14:38.772
So maybe we'll get our heads
blown off after all.

14:56.824 --> 15:00.076
Omar used to have a safe house
in this apartment building.

15:00.161 --> 15:02.161
Yeah, well, even if he's here,
what makes you think

15:02.163 --> 15:03.496
he's gonna let us up?

15:03.631 --> 15:05.381
I've thrown this guy
a lot of money over the years.

15:05.499 --> 15:07.801
The guy I know
wouldn't risk losing that.

15:07.918 --> 15:10.386
I think he already has.

15:13.007 --> 15:15.558
[Doorbell rings]

15:18.512 --> 15:20.096
[Speaking Chechen]

15:20.181 --> 15:22.432
It's McQuaid.

15:27.071 --> 15:29.989
Are you gonna let me in?

15:31.692 --> 15:34.244
[Door buzzes]

15:41.252 --> 15:44.587
[Baby crying]

15:46.757 --> 15:48.374
Quickly.

15:48.509 --> 15:49.542
Quickly.

15:52.596 --> 15:54.097
What happened
at the border, Omar?

15:54.215 --> 15:55.798
You were supposed to meet us.

15:55.933 --> 15:58.551
I am sorry.
I was detained.

16:08.062 --> 16:10.063
How did you get through?

16:10.231 --> 16:12.565
Without your help.

16:12.650 --> 16:15.902
Things have gotten bad
since we talked last.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.987
Is that why you're
camped out here?

16:18.122 --> 16:20.290
I've made some inquiries
to help you

16:20.407 --> 16:22.876
and quickly found out
Belenko has a lot of friends

16:22.993 --> 16:24.033
in the Russian government.

16:24.078 --> 16:25.745
Well, I thought you did too.

16:25.913 --> 16:29.832
Not as many
as him apparently.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.051
They've ordered
that he not be touched.

16:32.169 --> 16:34.087
There's a lot of money
working in his favor.

16:34.221 --> 16:36.021
People are not going
to want to help you here.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.674
Okay, what
about our friend Auggie?

16:37.758 --> 16:39.259
Have you heard anything
about him?

16:39.343 --> 16:40.593
It's too late
for your friend.

16:40.761 --> 16:43.763
If Belenko has him,
he doesn't have long to live.

16:43.931 --> 16:45.014
Do you know where
our friend is?

16:45.149 --> 16:46.849
It doesn't matter
where your friend is.

16:46.984 --> 16:50.236
Belenko knows you're coming.
He owns the Chechens.

16:50.354 --> 16:51.938
The Russians
are looking the other way.

16:52.022 --> 16:55.275
You need to think about getting
out of the country.

16:55.409 --> 16:56.609
I'm losing my patience.

16:56.777 --> 17:00.196
I hear you, but something
must've spooked Omar...

17:00.331 --> 17:04.917
And it must've been pretty big
'cause nothing scares him.

17:05.035 --> 17:08.338
Everyone's scared
of something.

17:08.454 --> 17:10.123
Aah!

17:15.296 --> 17:18.298
I don't have time to waste.
Tell me where my friend is.

17:26.588 --> 17:27.821
Please, I'm losing blood.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.778
You either tell me where
my friend is, or you bleed out.

17:30.779 --> 17:32.063
It's your choice.

17:32.197 --> 17:34.782
Ryan, my friend,
I don't know anything.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.233
Please.

17:36.368 --> 17:37.818
I think
you better tell her, Omar.

17:37.953 --> 17:39.236
I don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

17:39.371 --> 17:40.571
You don't understand.

17:40.739 --> 17:42.990
If I say anything,
I'm giving my life away.

17:43.075 --> 17:44.291
Belenko--he'll kill me.

17:44.409 --> 17:46.327
Aah!

17:46.461 --> 17:47.912
You're too worried
about Belenko

17:48.080 --> 17:49.747
and not worried enough
about me.

17:53.585 --> 17:55.219
There's an old apartment
building

17:55.320 --> 17:58.222
on the west end of town,
destroyed during the war.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.808
I can give you the address.

18:00.926 --> 18:04.095
Belenko is keeping him there.

18:04.229 --> 18:05.813
Write it down.

18:10.435 --> 18:11.986
Please, that's all I know.

18:16.274 --> 18:18.909
We were able to identify
the location Annie provided.

18:19.027 --> 18:20.411
It's the ruins
of an apartment building

18:20.529 --> 18:21.946
on the western edge of Grozny.

18:22.114 --> 18:23.714
Now, given the flight time
from Incirlik,

18:23.749 --> 18:25.116
how soon can you
have your platoon on the ground?

18:25.250 --> 18:27.251
Until we have a visual
confirmation of our target,

18:27.335 --> 18:29.086
we're not about to enter
into Russian airspace.

18:29.171 --> 18:31.171
Commander, this might well be
the best intelligence

18:31.206 --> 18:33.007
we're gonna get.
It's unverified.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.708
You have people on the ground.
Get a visual.

18:34.793 --> 18:36.677
We don't know
what kind of fortifications

18:36.795 --> 18:38.045
Belenko might have inside.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.847
My people are not equipped
for a commando raid.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.099
We've only got one shot
at this.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.801
The minute our Black Hawks
enter the country,

18:43.969 --> 18:45.019
they're gonna send off alarms.

18:45.137 --> 18:46.817
They'll barely have time
to storm the place

18:46.938 --> 18:48.272
before the Russians arrive,

18:48.356 --> 18:50.676
and you can bet they're gonna be
watching the border after.

18:50.809 --> 18:52.226
So it's best
that we're 100% certain

18:52.360 --> 18:53.861
we're raiding the right place.

18:53.979 --> 18:56.147
Wouldn't you agree?

19:14.966 --> 19:16.446
Omar knew where Auggie
was being held.

19:16.501 --> 19:17.802
I didn't have time to be nice.

19:17.919 --> 19:20.337
Look, I followed your cue,

19:20.505 --> 19:23.424
but maybe just tell me
what you're gonna do next time.

19:26.895 --> 19:28.846
Okay.

19:47.165 --> 19:50.034
[Groaning]

19:58.927 --> 20:02.179
Once again,
tell me what happened

20:02.297 --> 20:04.181
to James Deckard.

20:07.052 --> 20:08.102
You must already know,

20:08.220 --> 20:12.356
otherwise you wouldn't keep
asking me.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.026
You look tired, Mr. Anderson.

20:17.479 --> 20:20.731
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

20:20.866 --> 20:23.367
A long time.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.985
How about you?

20:25.070 --> 20:28.205
Oh, until you tell me
what I need to know.

20:30.375 --> 20:33.210
Should we put you back
in the box?

20:36.331 --> 20:39.300
You want to know
what happened to Deckard?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.419
[Spits]
He's dead.

20:42.587 --> 20:44.255
Tell me how he died.

20:53.315 --> 20:55.816
I was assigned a...

20:55.934 --> 20:58.652
prisoner exchange in Grozny.

21:00.105 --> 21:02.239
Deckard was there undercover.

21:02.324 --> 21:04.775
We brought our prisoner
to an agreed-upon location

21:04.943 --> 21:06.827
according to strict protocols.

21:58.163 --> 21:59.747
We have the prisoner.

22:03.635 --> 22:05.336
Why do you have five men?

22:11.476 --> 22:14.178
We also agreed to do
the exchange in English, Imran.

22:14.312 --> 22:17.982
You calling me liar?

22:18.099 --> 22:19.099
Imran...

22:31.329 --> 22:34.415
Hey, look...
Hey, what's done is done.

22:34.532 --> 22:36.033
We're here.

22:36.117 --> 22:37.701
We have Mikhail.

22:37.836 --> 22:39.370
You have our man Mueller.

22:39.504 --> 22:41.705
Let's make the exchange.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.424
Why should we trust you now?

22:43.541 --> 22:45.342
You CIA are all liars.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.140
You shouldn't even be here
in this country.

22:47.262 --> 22:48.796
This isn't
about what happened before.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.964
This is about right now.

22:51.099 --> 22:54.301
This is about making a deal
for Mikhail.

22:54.436 --> 22:56.387
Tell that one back there
to lower his weapon.

22:56.521 --> 22:58.138
Tony, lower your weapon.

22:58.223 --> 23:00.307
Not while he's got his barrel
pointed at my ten ring.

23:00.442 --> 23:04.061
Tony, lower your weapon.

23:04.195 --> 23:05.729
Please.

23:23.081 --> 23:24.915
Ah!
[Gunfire]

23:25.050 --> 23:26.750
I lost control
of the situation,

23:26.918 --> 23:30.721
and the Chechens opened fire.

23:30.839 --> 23:34.425
My team was trained
to fight back, so they did.

23:34.509 --> 23:37.061
We lost our prisoner...

23:37.178 --> 23:38.929
My teammate Dale.

23:41.149 --> 23:45.018
All the Chechens were killed,
including Deckard.

23:45.153 --> 23:46.570
That is bullshit.

23:46.688 --> 23:48.939
[Scoffs]

23:49.107 --> 23:53.410
You are lying to me,
and that is a problem.

23:53.495 --> 23:56.280
- I'm telling you what happened.
- That is not what happened.

23:56.414 --> 23:58.449
I know for a fact you're not
telling me everything.

23:58.616 --> 24:01.085
Whoever told you
that is lying, then.

24:01.202 --> 24:03.537
You received
sere training, yes?

24:07.258 --> 24:09.843
Obviously
you can withstand torture,

24:09.961 --> 24:12.763
but I wonder if you can listen
to someone else get tortured,

24:12.847 --> 24:14.181
someone you care about.

24:14.299 --> 24:16.967
Auggie!

24:17.051 --> 24:19.853
Tash?

24:19.971 --> 24:21.472
Tash?

24:25.152 --> 24:27.520
Tash, I'm so sorry.

24:27.654 --> 24:29.221
How did they find you?

24:29.323 --> 24:31.574
I don't know.
I was in Budapest.

24:31.692 --> 24:34.694
They grabbed me off the street.

24:34.778 --> 24:36.112
Auggie, who is that man?

24:36.246 --> 24:38.664
It's Aleksandre Belenko.
He's a terrorist.

24:38.782 --> 24:40.666
- What did you do to him?
- I don't know.

24:40.784 --> 24:42.168
Then what's this all about?

24:42.252 --> 24:43.536
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.121
What does he want
you to tell him?

24:45.255 --> 24:48.791
This can't be for nothing.
Tash, we can't speak freely.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.712
They're listening in.
Of course.

24:52.846 --> 24:54.513
Well...

24:54.631 --> 24:56.632
Whatever you're not saying,

24:56.767 --> 24:59.101
I hope it's something
you're willing to die for.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.910
Ah!
[Gunfire]

26:36.233 --> 26:37.233
Dale.

26:46.293 --> 26:48.327
That was a freakin' shitshow.

26:48.462 --> 26:49.462
I don't see how Deckard

26:49.579 --> 26:51.714
goes back for the Chechens
after this.

26:51.832 --> 26:54.500
Tony, Charlie,
check on Mueller.

26:57.671 --> 26:59.088
Deckard, let's talk.

27:05.595 --> 27:07.847
Sir, sir, there's a call
for you, line two.

27:07.981 --> 27:09.849
[Whispering]
It's Sydney.

27:12.652 --> 27:14.186
[Whispering]
Will you tell her, uh,

27:14.321 --> 27:16.572
that I'm sorry I'm not gonna be
able to make it tonight?

27:16.690 --> 27:18.524
- Of course.
- Thanks, Patrick.

27:18.692 --> 27:20.693
[Normal voice]
All right, where are we?

27:20.777 --> 27:22.027
Okay.

27:22.195 --> 27:23.496
All right.

27:23.613 --> 27:24.780
I see.

27:24.915 --> 27:26.665
Of course.

27:26.783 --> 27:28.918
Thank you.

27:32.539 --> 27:36.125
[Knock at door]

27:41.631 --> 27:43.132
Yes?

28:44.778 --> 28:47.363
I recognize one of those guys.
He works for Belenko.

28:47.447 --> 28:49.782
Looks like we've come
to the right place.

28:49.950 --> 28:51.450
Okay, I'll call this in,

28:51.585 --> 28:52.785
but if they balk,
I'm not gonna wait.

28:52.953 --> 28:56.789
I know.
I know you, Walker.

29:02.095 --> 29:05.381
- Ready?
- Yeah.

29:21.615 --> 29:23.282
Do you hear that sound?

29:23.400 --> 29:25.484
Yes?
[Electricity crackles]

29:25.619 --> 29:28.153
That is electricity,

29:28.288 --> 29:31.657
and I am going to arc
it through her body.

29:31.825 --> 29:33.993
The amperage is low enough
that she'll remain alive

29:34.160 --> 29:37.413
for quite some time,
but still very much in pain.

29:37.547 --> 29:40.165
What is this about, Belenko?

29:40.333 --> 29:42.167
Is this about one
of the Chechens who died?

29:42.335 --> 29:43.502
What do you care
about Chechens dying?

29:43.670 --> 29:45.004
One of them was
special to you.

29:45.171 --> 29:47.306
I can hear it in your voice.

29:50.844 --> 29:54.680
Come on, don't you want me
to know before you kill me...

29:54.814 --> 29:57.683
To truly appreciate the lengths
you've gone to get me here?

29:57.851 --> 30:00.769
Mikhail Kokorin!

30:00.854 --> 30:03.856
Your prisoner...

30:04.024 --> 30:05.274
He was my brother.

30:05.408 --> 30:08.527
So you're doing all this
just for revenge?

30:08.612 --> 30:11.363
I'm doing this
because you murdered him.

30:21.041 --> 30:24.259
[Gasps, coughs]

30:24.377 --> 30:25.697
Then this is about me
and my team.

30:25.712 --> 30:27.212
This is about what we did.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.764
This isn't about Natasha.
Just let her go.

30:28.882 --> 30:30.265
Just kill me. Just kill me.
No, no, no.

30:30.383 --> 30:34.103
There's still something
I need from you.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.721
You told me your version
of events,

30:35.855 --> 30:38.724
but there is another one
that I also heard,

30:38.892 --> 30:42.811
one about a CIA insider, hmm?

30:42.946 --> 30:45.814
Working with the Chechens...

30:45.899 --> 30:47.816
Deckard.

30:47.951 --> 30:50.569
He killed Mikhail,
and your team helped him do so.

30:50.737 --> 30:52.237
I told you, Deckard's dead.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.156
Yes, you did tell me that.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.159
Mm-hmm.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.712
But where is his body?

30:59.829 --> 31:02.715
It just disappeared.
No one has seen him.

31:06.803 --> 31:08.087
Deckard,
what do you want to do?

31:08.221 --> 31:10.139
I can't go back, Auggie.

31:10.256 --> 31:11.306
Everything that just happened--

31:11.424 --> 31:13.892
it's too much, man,
too many deaths.

31:14.010 --> 31:16.061
I can't even sleep as it is.
It's okay.

31:16.146 --> 31:19.148
Hey, it's okay. Come in.
Let the CIA get you out of here.

31:19.265 --> 31:21.465
No, man, they're just gonna
plug me back in the machine,

31:21.601 --> 31:23.769
drop me somewhere else
where things will be worse.

31:23.937 --> 31:26.438
Okay, I need to get
away from all this--

31:26.573 --> 31:28.824
everything.

31:28.942 --> 31:30.325
What are you saying?

31:30.443 --> 31:33.412
I'm saying you don't know
what happened to me, okay?

31:33.530 --> 31:35.080
Maybe I died,

31:35.198 --> 31:37.616
all you know for sure
is that I disappeared.

31:42.706 --> 31:45.624
- This is really what you want?
- Yeah.

31:45.759 --> 31:47.843
Okay, I saved your life.

31:47.961 --> 31:50.546
You help me save mine.

31:52.766 --> 31:53.849
I know a way out of here.

31:53.967 --> 31:58.270
You can escape
without being seen. Come on.

32:02.809 --> 32:06.228
You can keep quiet, but let
me assure you of one thing.

32:06.362 --> 32:09.531
You are going to die here...

32:09.649 --> 32:12.317
In the same place
my brother died,

32:12.452 --> 32:14.787
and the only two choices
you have to make

32:14.871 --> 32:18.207
are whether Miss Petrovna lives,
and how much she'll suffer.

32:30.303 --> 32:32.499
Joan, we have scouted
this area for an hour,

32:32.500 --> 32:33.717
and there is no way
to make an approach

32:33.835 --> 32:34.968
without dealing with the guards.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.254
So no visual confirmation?

32:37.388 --> 32:40.340
No, not without potentially
alerting them we are here.

32:40.508 --> 32:42.668
No, it's too risky. I'll get
them to send in the SEALs.

32:42.677 --> 32:45.262
I just need a little time.
Joan, I'm not sitting here.

32:45.396 --> 32:47.597
Annie, the building
could be booby-trapped.

32:47.682 --> 32:49.182
Belenko won't have made
this easy for you.

32:49.317 --> 32:51.018
The longer we wait,

32:51.102 --> 32:52.986
the more likely
it is they'll kill Auggie.

32:53.071 --> 32:57.190
I will get you
reinforcements.

32:57.325 --> 32:58.992
I promise.

33:03.614 --> 33:06.917
One of Belenko's guards isn't
a confirmation of our target.

33:07.035 --> 33:08.418
All due respect, Commander,

33:08.536 --> 33:11.505
Annie cannot get you that
without considerable risk.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.662
And yet you're asking my men
to take that same risk.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.042
It's a risk
they're trained for.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.977
Mrs. Campbell,

33:17.078 --> 33:19.880
I don't run an operation
on hunches or emotion.

33:20.048 --> 33:21.264
I run it on intelligence.

33:21.382 --> 33:23.467
I don't send my men
into hostile countries

33:23.601 --> 33:25.519
unless I'm absolutely sure
what I'm looking for

33:25.636 --> 33:26.937
is actually there.

33:27.055 --> 33:29.306
Are you here to help us?

33:29.390 --> 33:32.642
Because I feel like all
you're doing is stonewalling.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.945
You can justify your choice
any way you want,

33:35.063 --> 33:38.482
but if my operative dies
because of your inaction,

33:38.616 --> 33:40.283
it's on you.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.992
Belenko, don't do this.
Belenko, don't do this.

33:49.127 --> 33:51.411
I'm not doing this.

33:51.546 --> 33:54.414
You're doing this by not
telling me what I need to know.

33:54.582 --> 33:56.049
Remember that.

33:56.167 --> 33:57.501
Wait. Wait.

33:57.635 --> 34:00.003
- Aah!
- Stop! Stop! Stop it!

34:00.138 --> 34:01.805
Please, stop!

34:01.923 --> 34:03.890
Stop!

34:04.008 --> 34:05.509
I'll talk!
I'll tell you everything.

34:05.593 --> 34:07.511
Oh, screw him.

34:07.595 --> 34:11.598
Don't tell him anything, Auggie.
Tash, he will kill you.

34:11.766 --> 34:12.933
That's my choice.

34:13.101 --> 34:16.103
He's right, Natasha.
I will kill you.

34:16.270 --> 34:19.322
- Aah!
- No! No!

34:19.440 --> 34:21.108
Stop!

34:21.275 --> 34:23.025
I told you I'd talk.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.007
What's happening?
Where--where are they going?

34:38.126 --> 34:39.292
They left.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.594
We're alone.
What the hell are you doing?

34:41.712 --> 34:42.879
Why are you letting
him torture you?

34:43.014 --> 34:44.347
I told him
I'd tell him the truth.

34:44.465 --> 34:46.967
You know how much
I like being told what to do.

34:47.135 --> 34:48.802
I don't trust him.

34:48.969 --> 34:51.888
I think he's going
to kill us both.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.974
I'd rather go down fighting.

34:54.108 --> 34:56.476
I'd rather
not go down at all.

34:56.610 --> 34:57.811
Did you get a look
at this building

34:57.945 --> 34:59.362
when they brought you in?
What's it look like?

34:59.480 --> 35:03.567
It's some kind of old,
ruined apartment building.

35:03.701 --> 35:05.986
We're in the basement.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.205
So he was telling the truth.

35:08.322 --> 35:10.073
He said his brother
was killed here in 2005.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.625
I remember it.
What does that mean?

35:11.742 --> 35:13.326
It means there's a way out.

35:13.461 --> 35:15.745
The hook I'm hanging from--
it's a chain, right?

35:15.830 --> 35:16.880
Yeah.

35:16.998 --> 35:18.832
All right,
is there anything on that chain?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.500
Anything else on that chain
right above me?

35:20.668 --> 35:23.253
No.
What are you gonna do?

35:23.387 --> 35:26.173
The guards
slipped me on this thing.

35:26.340 --> 35:29.342
If I can get my feet
hooked on to that chain,

35:29.477 --> 35:32.345
maybe I can slip myself off.

35:32.513 --> 35:37.017
[Grunting]

35:38.769 --> 35:41.821
Aah!

35:41.939 --> 35:45.992
Commander Wheeler, I was
hoping we could have a word.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.028
You just being friendly 'cause
your wife chewed me out?

35:48.112 --> 35:50.947
- She's got strong convictions.
- Mm-hmm.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.366
I can see you do as well,
Commander.

35:53.534 --> 35:55.669
Maybe you don't know this.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.873
I lost a son last year.

36:00.007 --> 36:01.424
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:01.542 --> 36:04.044
I know how something like that
can color your decisions.

36:04.178 --> 36:06.218
Your son gave up his life
to protect American lives.

36:06.380 --> 36:07.547
That's noble.

36:07.682 --> 36:09.299
It's what he chose.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.552
It's what every member
of the SEALs chooses.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.271
Every person in this office
right now

36:14.388 --> 36:15.889
is here because
of Auggie and Annie.

36:16.023 --> 36:18.108
They'd gladly risk their lives,
myself included,

36:18.226 --> 36:19.943
if it meant we could save them.

36:20.061 --> 36:22.062
This isn't a perfect situation,

36:22.196 --> 36:24.447
and I can't make it any better.

36:24.565 --> 36:26.066
All I can do, sir,

36:26.234 --> 36:28.618
is ask for your help
to bring our people home.

36:46.003 --> 36:48.138
[Speaking Chechen]

37:23.007 --> 37:24.874
I got him!
You find Auggie!

37:32.383 --> 37:33.967
Belenko!

37:34.135 --> 37:36.219
Don't move.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.221
You should drop
your weapon, Miss Walker.

37:38.356 --> 37:39.389
You being funny?

37:39.523 --> 37:41.107
This is a dead man's switch.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.059
If you shoot me, I drop it,

37:43.194 --> 37:46.313
and this building explodes,
and your friend Auggie dies.

37:46.397 --> 37:47.864
How do I know
Auggie's still alive?

37:47.982 --> 37:49.902
You don't, but are you willing
to take that risk?

37:49.984 --> 37:52.819
One more step,
and I'll drop it.

38:01.379 --> 38:02.495
The next one hits you.

38:02.663 --> 38:07.584
Go. You're not going
to shoot me, Annie.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.170
- You sure?
- Yes...

38:10.304 --> 38:13.139
Because you want Auggie to live.
[Cell phone beeps]

38:14.675 --> 38:16.843
[Cell phone beeps]

38:16.977 --> 38:20.063
I, however, do not.

38:21.265 --> 38:22.649
[Gasps]

39:54.896 --> 39:57.348
Auggie!

40:00.352 --> 40:02.269
Auggie!

41:05.001 --> 41:06.001
Stephanie Banks.

41:06.119 --> 41:08.504
- Whoa.
- What happened?

41:08.622 --> 41:11.123
She was shot, fell through
a window trying to escape--

41:11.207 --> 41:13.592
lucky someone found her
when they did.

41:15.962 --> 41:17.379
- You able to walk?
- Yeah.

41:17.514 --> 41:19.131
We need to get out of here
before the Russians show up.

41:19.299 --> 41:20.849
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.468
He's not fine.
He needs help.

41:22.602 --> 41:24.770
Let me help you.

41:27.274 --> 41:29.224
This isn't over.

41:29.359 --> 41:30.442
What do you mean?

41:30.560 --> 41:33.312
The people Belenko
was targeting, my unit,

41:33.446 --> 41:36.615
there's one guy still alive--
James Deckard.

41:36.733 --> 41:38.901
I owe him my life.

41:38.985 --> 41:40.619
Belenko knows about him,

41:40.737 --> 41:43.322
which means it's only a matter
of time before he finds him.

41:43.456 --> 41:44.957
We've got to get to him first.

41:45.075 --> 41:47.459
