00:04.087 --> 00:05.088
What... What is his nam?
It's driving me crazy.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.383
You know, I wanna say Wayne
or, like, Phil or somet.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.093
Just forget about it.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.512
Oh! Boo-Boo!

00:12.471 --> 00:14.181
That was Yogi Bear's
little buddy!

00:14.222 --> 00:14.974
Oh!

00:16.851 --> 00:17.726
Hey.
Hey, how was the doctor
appointment?

00:18.226 --> 00:19.060
It was good.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.395
Yeah, all systems go.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.356
Hey, did you guys
find out the sex?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.315
Of Brenda?

00:26.193 --> 00:27.194
We think girl.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.574
No, the doctor knows,
but Audrey wouldn't
let him tell us.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.202
I want it to
be a surprise.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.745
The whole thing's
gonna be a surprise.

00:36.787 --> 00:40.916
Like we have any idea
how to take care
of a child.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.001
We don't even know
what happened to our ca.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
Oh, I just had an idea.
I will throw you
a baby shower.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.633
Oh, that's so sweet.
You don't have to
do that.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.635
You know, Jen,
you really don't have t.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.136
Hey, Jeff,
she obviously wants to.

00:54.972 --> 00:55.556
Don't be rude.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.978
Come on, it'll be fun.
Everybody loves
a baby shower.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.062
Yeah, so fun.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.064
Uh, honey...

01:05.524 --> 01:06.859
Throwing parties
isn't really your thing.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.070
That's not true.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.321
Remember
the spa-themed shower
you threw for Megan?

01:13.615 --> 01:14.992
It was a minor
fungal outbreak.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.706
Oh... Ah!

01:22.708 --> 01:24.125
Did you just
unbutton your pants?

01:26.545 --> 01:27.337
I did.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.715
Is it really
necessary?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.718
Well, I wanna
prevent my button
from popping off

01:33.677 --> 01:35.136
and boring
through Brenda's skull.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.769
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.691
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not sc?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.989
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:07.252 --> 02:08.087
Sir...

02:09.755 --> 02:11.339
Have you had a chance
to take a look

02:11.381 --> 02:12.716
at my proposal for the
new children's hospital?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.593
(GROANING) I have not.

02:16.219 --> 02:16.971
And that goofy voice
of yours

02:18.097 --> 02:19.514
is like an ax
hacking away at my skul.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.393
Late night?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.438
Welcoming the women of
New York to rock bottom?

02:27.648 --> 02:28.983
(GROANS)

02:30.692 --> 02:32.069
It's been a week
since I've rocked
any bottom.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.282
It's been a rough winter
for the old Russell mus.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.620
(CLICKS PEN)
Disgusting, sir.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.790
But things
are looking up.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.959
I went online and
found a new happy hour
I haven't hit yet.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.044
Which way is Delaware?

02:52.171 --> 02:54.382
Sir, before you cross
into that tiny state,

02:55.258 --> 02:56.551
with your
big-city viruses...

02:59.304 --> 03:00.848
Might I suggest
that perhaps you're
trying too hard?

03:01.431 --> 03:02.057
How do you figure?

03:03.767 --> 03:06.061
Well, when Simon Cumberbash,
the sublime batsman from
our county side,

03:07.729 --> 03:09.648
suffered a significant
slump in form during
our push for the title,

03:10.649 --> 03:15.154
do you know
what the selectors did?

03:15.194 --> 03:16.655
What are you saying?
Are you having a seizur?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.118
I'm talking about
an elite cricketer

03:21.160 --> 03:22.369
who was taken out
of the game

03:22.410 --> 03:24.746
because he was
playing horribly.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.747
He was trying too hard
so he needed a breather.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.793
But after being left
out of the side for
a few games,

03:29.835 --> 03:31.419
he returned
and inspired the team

03:31.461 --> 03:33.380
to the first-class
championship.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.756
Ah, that's classic
Cumberbash.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.259
So what's your point?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.094
My point is, sir,

03:40.595 --> 03:41.889
that I think you would
greatly benefit from
taking a break

03:43.015 --> 03:44.391
and focusing on things
other than women.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.896
Hmm. Timmy,
could we go one full day
without you hitting on ?

03:53.608 --> 03:55.610
Look, your efforts
haven't been successful,
anyway.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.864
For one week,
just one week, I'm sure
there are some hobbies

03:59.907 --> 04:00.782
you could funnel
your energies into.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.325
I don't know, maybe.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.493
Just think, sir,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.454
of all the girls who
will turn 18 next week.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.084
True.
Hmm.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.713
Think about
all the other girls
who'll be turning 30.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.354
Hey, Aud, definitely
register for this.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.024
I like this.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.737
Jeff, look.
Check it out, ready?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.406
(HUMS SONG)

04:42.199 --> 04:43.324
Whoo, baby down!

04:45.953 --> 04:47.162
Oh, I see you found
one of our nursing pill.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.083
They can be such a help
in positioning the baby
for a bottle or a breas.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.126
Sorry, bottle or what?

04:52.167 --> 04:52.793

five months along?

05:01.176 --> 05:02.343

actually.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.595
Oh, such an exciting ti.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.389
Yeah, only to be topped
with the excitement

05:06.431 --> 05:07.849
of it actually
coming out of me.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.103
Is this the first one
for you and your husban?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.896
My husband?
Ew, gross, no...

05:13.855 --> 05:14.940

I'm the mommy.

in there is mine, actua.

is my husband.

Oh, shoot, I gotta
get back to the office.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.167
Okay, look,
give me your list

05:33.208 --> 05:34.960
and we will
finish registering
for everything for you.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.128
Eh, all right, okay.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.965
I mean, you certainly
look more the part
than I do.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.967
Look, it's not a big de.
We got this, right, Jef?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.342
We've got it,
you're in good hands.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.261
Okay, thanks.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.099
Let's get out of here.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.100
No.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.270
Here, you find the stuf,
I am gonna try on some
maternity jeans.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.647
Maternity jeans?
Sounds like a scam.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.566
No, it's not a scam.
See, they stretch.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.319

my growing belly.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.288
Excuse me.

doing in so early?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.846
Well, I'm energized.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.640
I took your advice,
I decided to give up
the ladies for a bit.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.017
Oh, well, that's bad nes
for anyone selling
pepper spray.

06:32.059 --> 06:32.934

06:34.519 --> 06:36.855

evening sans skanks?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.691
(LAUGHS)
Well, you know how it i.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.651
We move on boats
against the current

06:42.652 --> 06:43.695
borne back ceaselessly
into the past.

from  The Great Gatsby?

Last night I got
my F. Scott on.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.915
Well, would you
look at that?

06:54.956 --> 06:55.790
One evening not focused
on women

06:56.833 --> 06:58.835
and you read
a classic American nove.

06:58.877 --> 06:59.961

than you were yesterday.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.213
Huh, and I feel
better, too.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.839
Hmm.
Oh, almost forgot.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.759
Hey, I whipped this up
last night after readin.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.343
Care for one?

Huh?

07:16.853 --> 07:17.854
Heavenly, sir.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.900
What on earth possessed
you to make this?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.110
What, I'm gonna
make moussaka and
not have any baklava?

07:23.151 --> 07:36.123
What am I, an animal?

like those new jeans.

like every day this wee.

to me.

you won't be able
to fit into them anymor.

about that.

you didn't tell me
new baby presents arriv.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.400
Yeah, why can't
all that stuff go
straight to Brenda?

08:03.442 --> 08:04.734
Because Brenda's
not the mother.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.195

grow up here.

I'm gonna start
labeling my food.

get all dolled up

wear shoes that you
can play beer pong in?

she's had some really
crappy parties before,

08:30.760 --> 08:32.095
but I think she's
excited about this.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.973
I think she's really
gonna step up.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.850
All right, I'm headed
to the movies.

wrong date on these.

Oh, I'll say.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.033

something for the baby

09:35.075 --> 09:36.868
and I brought my baby.

looking at?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.500
It's Cornelius, silly.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.169
No one recognizes him
with his haircut.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.338
Okay, uh, well,
like I said,

09:49.214 --> 09:50.173
um, we have
a bit more to do.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.218
So, maybe come back
in like 45?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.429

because Corny needs
a diaper change.

wrap this carrier back p
for Audrey.

if I borrow a couple
of things from you guys?

Yeah, sure.
What do you need?

Uh, napkins, plates,
chairs, food.

hosting that party.

a pinata shaped like a baby?

I don't know,
check the pinata cabine.

and I'm hoping to put u.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.481
You know,
off Broadway, of course.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.360
My goodness.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.907
Yeah, it's no Eugene O'Neil,
but I'll give Tom Stoppd
a run for his money, hu?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.242
Oh, and I looked at this
big chunk of mahogany,

11:42.243 --> 11:43.411
and I saw this guy
trying to get out.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.125
Is it for the Binghams'
baby-to-be, sir?

11:51.919 --> 11:52.920
Uh, yeah sure.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.924
Mr. Dunbar,

11:58.801 --> 12:01.054
it truly is amazing what
you can accomplish witht
the distraction of wome.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.766
Might you consider, sir,
focusing your now-clear
mind on my...

12:06.934 --> 12:09.479
Oh, the children's hosp.
Hospital, yes.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.897
Five steps ahead of you.
I finished the proposal.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.858
I've been tooling around
with the design.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.651
Spectacular.
I tell you what.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.487
Come by the office
later today,
I'll show you what I go.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.821
Oh, thank you
so much, sir...

12:20.114 --> 12:21.658
Oh, my God, you painted
a fresco on your ceilin.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.618
(LAUGHS)

12:25.912 --> 12:27.706
You try writing a play
about Michelangelo
and not getting inspire.

12:34.128 --> 12:34.921
(SIGHS)

12:36.839 --> 12:37.965
(SANDWICH THUDS)

12:42.596 --> 12:43.555
Oh, right.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.058
Well he better not have
taken any of my scotch.

12:50.144 --> 12:50.895
Good.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.524
Come on, the glasses?

13:07.662 --> 13:08.496
Hey.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.624
Thank God, we are
all out of food.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.626
Where'd you go?
Uh, the Korean deli.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.669
It was the closest place
I could find.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.462
What are these?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.380
Those are
Korean squid cookies.

13:18.005 --> 13:18.757
They are to die for.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.513
Thank you so much for
hosting Audrey's shower.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.224
Oh, you're so welcome, Trac,
I'm so glad you could make .

13:28.266 --> 13:30.310
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.270
It is so important
to celebrate babies
coming into this world.

13:33.187 --> 13:33.896
No matter
if the Lord intended

13:35.148 --> 13:36.190
the cockamamie way
Audrey's doing it or no.

13:40.027 --> 13:40.987
Jen? Jen?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.822
I need to use your bathroom,
but you're out
of toilet paper.

13:44.157 --> 13:44.907
Oh...

13:47.868 --> 13:48.620
Sorry.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.087
Audrey!
Jen.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.131
Thank you so much
for doing this.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.425
My pleasure,
you just deserve this.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.051
Oh, there she is.

14:04.843 --> 14:05.804
You're glowing.
(CHUCKLES)

14:08.264 --> 14:09.182
I...

14:13.353 --> 14:14.228
Ching Bao?

14:14.979 --> 14:30.203
Made with real squid in.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.371
Good afternoon, sir.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.913
Hey, there he is.

14:34.040 --> 14:34.957
Timmy.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.670
Excited to show you
the model for your
new children's hospital.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.380
May I just say again, s,

14:41.715 --> 14:42.799
what you've been
able to accomplish
in the past week

14:43.466 --> 14:44.133
is truly astounding.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.678
Well, since we started
this experiment,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.139
I've gone days
without even thinking
about women.

14:50.181 --> 14:56.187
Anyway,
here's your hospital.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.063
Hmm?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.358
Oh, my God.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.319
It's amazing, right?

15:04.529 --> 15:05.446
Yes, um...

15:07.198 --> 15:08.991
Dare I ask, sir,
what are those?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.454
Oh, these are
observation mounds.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.625
Originally,
they were smaller,

15:17.667 --> 15:19.126
but then I made them bigger,
and I'm much happier.

15:21.838 --> 15:22.672
Check out
the welcoming entrance.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.388
Is that what that is?

15:32.682 --> 15:33.725
At first I had a lot
of landscaping down the.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.852
I made it
really full and lush.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.731
But then
I said, "No good."

15:39.773 --> 15:40.690
I decided to trim it do,
you know?

15:42.358 --> 15:43.777
Give it a nice, sleek,
modern look.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.487
You sure did.
Yeah.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.657
But I keep thinking
all day long

15:50.742 --> 15:51.701
about putting
a monorail system in he.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.454
That goes in and out of
the entrance all day lo.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.290
In and out,
in and out.

15:59.208 --> 16:06.549
(AGGRESSIVELY) You know
the building wants it.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.425
I see.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.638
So we're no longer
talking about the
children's hospital?

16:11.679 --> 16:12.722
What children's hospita?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.394
So, Brenda, what does
your boyfriend think

16:18.436 --> 16:19.186
about this whole
surrogacy thing?

16:20.354 --> 16:21.355
Oh, I'm a lesbian.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.399
Oh. Really.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.234
That's, um...

16:26.778 --> 16:27.821
Hey, is that Ching Bao?

16:30.949 --> 16:32.116
Audrey still seems
a little off to me.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.120
Yeah, maybe
I'm throwing her off by
not being at the movies.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.538
Come on, I told you
to come up with
a baby shower game

16:37.580 --> 16:38.247
to make her feel better.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.624
Okay, fine.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.461
Hey, uh, everybody

16:45.505 --> 16:47.047
I have a classic
baby shower game
that I wanna play.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.467
Okay, so everyone
just grab a seat.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.552
Brenda, you're good
right there.
Okay.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.554
Okay, this game is calld

16:54.180 --> 16:54.848
Guess The Weight.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.390
Oh, I love this one.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.100
Me too, I'll start.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.060
Okay, I'm gonna say...

17:01.395 --> 17:02.188
170.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.026
What?

17:07.902 --> 17:08.862
Hey-O!

17:12.657 --> 17:13.783
This is supposed to help
make Audrey feel better.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.118
Oh, okay, no,
you're right, you're ri.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.581
Okay, let's start
with Audrey.

17:20.623 --> 17:21.374
170.

17:23.125 --> 17:23.877
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.172
Hey, how about
we open presents?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.090
That's a great idea.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.091
Okay, thanks,
you guys.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.804
Um, before I open them
I just... (SIGHS)

17:37.390 --> 17:38.850
When I look
around this room,

17:39.934 --> 17:41.853
I just realize
how lucky I am to have..

17:42.395 --> 17:43.521
Oh, God.
What?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.065
Oh, the baby
just kicked.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.149
ALL: Oh!
I wanna feel!

17:47.775 --> 17:48.860
Gimme some of that!

17:49.861 --> 17:50.862
Here, Audrey hold Corny.
Oh, jeez.

17:52.906 --> 17:53.740
You feel it?

17:56.034 --> 17:56.784
Jeff, are you home?

18:07.378 --> 18:08.922
What the...
Oh, forget it.

18:09.672 --> 18:10.381
I don't even
wanna know.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.300
What's that?

18:14.635 --> 18:15.386
The gift bag.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.097
Loose Special K
and some Baker's Chocolate.

18:21.976 --> 18:22.727
Not one of Jen's best.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.021
Well, it was
great for Brenda.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.190
I'm just a 170-pound

18:29.400 --> 18:31.110
non-pregnant woman
with cat pee on my dres.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.447
170?

18:36.574 --> 18:37.450
Really?

18:37.742 --> 18:38.492
No.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.789
(SIGHS) I guess I...
I thought this party
would make me feel

18:43.998 --> 18:45.291
more a part of
the whole process,
you know?

18:46.250 --> 18:46.793
But it didn't.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.003
Aud, come on.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.757
No, I'm...
I'm just a bystander
in this whole thing.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.342
You're not
a bystander.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.719
Yeah, well,
thanks for trying to
make me feel better,

18:57.386 --> 18:58.554
but it is what it is.

18:58.596 --> 19:02.516
I'm just gonna go lie d.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.893
Aud?
Yeah?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.188
It's a girl.

19:09.941 --> 19:10.691
What?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.653
I couldn't wait,
so I called the doctor.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.324
It's a girl?

19:19.492 --> 19:25.832
I kinda felt like
you needed to know so...

19:25.873 --> 19:27.541
(CRYING)
I did.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.129
Oh, my God!
What a crazy day.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.256
(SIGHS) I'll drink to t.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.096
(COUGHS)

19:48.187 --> 19:49.396
Ooh.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.734
Ah, in at 11:30
reeking of Amaretto
and shame.

19:54.152 --> 19:54.986
(LAUGHS)

19:56.946 --> 19:58.364
And all is right
in Dunbar Land.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.701
Yeah, well, got back
on the horse last night.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.746
Which is an apt descripn
of the young lady I bed.

20:10.209 --> 20:10.960
Not an attractive girl.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.338
Sir, having
witnessed firsthand

20:15.339 --> 20:16.256
the many talents
you possess...
Mmm?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.593
I'm left wondering,
what the hell
happened to you?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.139
It's a funny story, Tim.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.475
I was 10 years old.
The year was 1994.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.144
No, it wasn't.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.648
The year was 1994.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.151
(VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING)

20:37.319 --> 20:38.988
I was practicing for
my debut at Carnegie Hl

20:40.031 --> 20:41.824
when my parents
got me a new teacher.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.463
And it's been
a wonderful life
ever since.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.506
Ah.
