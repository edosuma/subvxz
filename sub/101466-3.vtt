00:41.594 --> 00:43.214
what's in it? It's cookies.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.320
I don't eat shellfish.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
It-it's cookies.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.518
Come on, it's cookies.

00:53.558 --> 00:54.980
It's got milk, sugar,

00:55.020 --> 00:56.980
butter... It's cookies.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.980
Why are you so complicated?

00:59.020 --> 01:00.321
-Please read it.

Powdered milk, flour,

walnut, butter, lard...

01:07.000 --> 01:09.980
"May contain shellfish."

01:10.020 --> 01:10.883
You should really stop

01:10.923 --> 01:12.543
shopping at that shitty PX.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
What are you reading?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
What are you reading?

01:32.000 --> 01:32.596
"In the body,

01:32.636 --> 01:33.980
where everything has a price,

01:34.020 --> 01:35.980
I was a beggar."

01:36.020 --> 01:37.980
A beggar?

01:38.020 --> 01:39.183
"I watched through

01:39.223 --> 01:39.980

01:40.020 --> 01:41.382
not the man showering, but

01:41.422 --> 01:43.222

01:46.000 --> 01:47.315
-Who's that?

01:47.355 --> 01:48.000
-Poet.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I don't get poetry.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.913
First time I saw you,

01:54.953 --> 01:56.393
you were reading a poem.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Me? Never.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.032
"So the body of me to

02:03.072 --> 02:04.980
all I meet or know."

02:05.020 --> 02:06.980
Spying on me?

02:07.020 --> 02:08.980
"To all I meet or know--"

02:09.020 --> 02:11.000
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.500
(sighs)

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Why do you read poetry?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.355
Same reason

02:19.395 --> 02:20.547
I hate your clothing.

02:20.587 --> 02:21.980
It's fast fashion.

02:22.020 --> 02:22.759
You buy something

02:22.799 --> 02:23.980
that you think you'll like,

02:24.020 --> 02:24.407
-and in two months,

02:24.447 --> 02:24.885
it ends up in the garbage.

02:24.925 --> 02:25.425
-Hmm.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.513
-I'm looking for stuff

02:27.553 --> 02:28.296
that means something.

02:28.336 --> 02:28.980
-Oh my God...

02:29.020 --> 02:30.544
And the same goes for poetry.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.204
Every word means something.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.711
You've never kissed

02:35.751 --> 02:36.980
anyone before,

02:37.020 --> 02:38.000
have you?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hm.

Not even Mark?

02:52.020 --> 02:53.063
-It wasn't like that.

02:53.103 --> 02:54.183
-Wasn't like what?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Fast feelings.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000

Soldier:

09:51.442 --> 09:52.980
This ain't fucking Disneyland!

09:53.020 --> 09:53.955
If you jump

09:53.995 --> 09:54.778
like that from a plane,

09:54.818 --> 09:56.198
you'd fuck up your leg!

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
(indistinct chatter)

10:06.000 --> 10:08.154
-Sam: I just really

10:08.194 --> 10:08.290
cared about her.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.000
-Hey, it's not your fault.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
(sighs)

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I have nothing.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You have me.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.980
(quiet chatter)

10:49.020 --> 10:49.204
Boy 1:

10:49.244 --> 10:49.980
I'll be over at 7:00.

10:50.020 --> 10:50.428
Boy 2:

10:50.468 --> 10:51.069
Aren't we supposed to

10:51.109 --> 10:51.980
watch it at your place?

10:52.020 --> 10:52.735
Boy 1:

10:52.775 --> 10:53.980
No, yours.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.000
(printer printing)

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
(quiet chatter continues)

11:13.000 --> 11:14.980
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am!

11:15.020 --> 11:16.156
Where should I put this?

11:16.196 --> 11:16.980
It's Ocean Vuong.

11:17.020 --> 11:17.955
-Please, you can

11:17.995 --> 11:18.489
leave it with me.

11:18.529 --> 11:18.980
-Thank you.

11:19.020 --> 11:19.621
Are you

11:19.661 --> 11:21.000
returning this?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.980
Hey.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.063
I've been waiting for

11:27.103 --> 11:28.183
it the whole week.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.980
How is it?

11:31.020 --> 11:32.980
Don't tell me.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.206
-Fraser: He's writing his

11:34.246 --> 11:34.733
first novel now.

11:34.773 --> 11:34.980
-Yeah.

11:35.020 --> 11:35.867
"On Earth,

11:35.907 --> 11:37.980
We're Briefly Gorgeous."

11:38.020 --> 11:39.980
You know what it's about?

11:40.020 --> 11:41.023
-It's about a little boy,

11:41.063 --> 11:41.675
his name is Little Dog.

11:41.715 --> 11:42.255
-(laughs)

11:43.000 --> 11:43.877
He's writing this

11:43.917 --> 11:44.980
letter to his mother,

11:45.020 --> 11:45.920
but his mother,

11:45.960 --> 11:46.980
she's illiterate,

11:47.020 --> 11:47.355
so she cannot

11:47.395 --> 11:48.715
understand his letter.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.380
-Hm.

11:49.420 --> 11:49.980
-Yeah.

11:50.020 --> 11:50.545
Anyway,

11:50.585 --> 11:51.980
I knew it was you.

11:52.020 --> 11:53.430
-Bye, Fraser.

11:53.470 --> 11:54.980
-Bye, M-Major.

11:55.020 --> 11:56.486
-Jonathan!

11:56.526 --> 11:58.000
-Jonathan.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
(printer printing)

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
(giggling)

12:11.000 --> 12:12.597
-(indistinct chatter)

12:12.637 --> 12:14.000
-(seagulls cawing)

12:20.000 --> 12:20.595
Soldier:

12:20.635 --> 12:22.000
Here we go! Ready?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Cate!

12:33.000 --> 12:34.980
Hey.

12:35.020 --> 12:35.675
Wanna get

12:35.715 --> 12:36.980
something to eat?

12:37.020 --> 12:37.317
Yeah.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.980
Something to drink maybe.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.000
Okay.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
(indistinct chatter)

12:47.000 --> 12:47.766
He's, like,

12:47.806 --> 12:48.980
really suffering.

12:49.020 --> 12:49.955
He's the one who

12:49.995 --> 12:50.980
broke up with me.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.980
What'd you say to him?

12:53.020 --> 12:55.980
-Okay.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.980
You told him okay?

12:58.020 --> 13:00.000
You want a veggie bowl?

13:01.000 --> 13:01.869
Have you ever really

13:01.909 --> 13:02.980
been in love with anyone?

13:03.020 --> 13:04.052
Do you know what

13:04.092 --> 13:05.000
it feels like?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.560
These look perfect on you.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.058
Thanks. Remember when

13:11.098 --> 13:11.980
we did that tattoo

13:12.020 --> 13:13.546
with the white board marker

13:13.586 --> 13:15.086
and it wouldn't come off?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
(giggles)

13:27.000 --> 13:28.331
I just told him we

13:28.371 --> 13:30.000
were getting together.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.963
We're going to Gianni's

13:33.003 --> 13:33.980
tonight. You wanna come?

13:34.020 --> 13:34.980
Mm-mm.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.472
-You're still seeing T-shirt.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.000
-Yeah.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.980
What's happening to us?

13:43.020 --> 13:44.040
What do you mean?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.980
You, me, the group.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.000
You're never around anymore.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Come here.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.220
It's just tonight,

13:55.260 --> 13:55.980
babe, okay?

13:56.020 --> 13:57.000
(kiss)

13:59.000 --> 13:59.821
Are you guys,

13:59.861 --> 14:01.000
like, a thing now?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
(chuckles)

14:13.000 --> 14:13.236
Caitlin:

14:13.276 --> 14:13.980
Why do you follow this?

14:14.020 --> 14:14.422
Fraser:

14:14.462 --> 14:15.980
'Cause I'm in the present

14:16.020 --> 14:16.459
and I try to support

14:16.499 --> 14:17.819
the universal freedom.

14:18.000 --> 14:18.577
Caitlin:

14:18.617 --> 14:20.980
Is it the hormones that do that?

14:21.020 --> 14:21.773
-Wow.

14:21.813 --> 14:22.201
-Fraser: Well,

14:22.241 --> 14:23.980
it's hormones plus genetics.

So transgender is, like,

14:38.238 --> 14:38.980
you change your name,

14:39.020 --> 14:39.744
change your face

14:39.784 --> 14:40.980
and your body, everything.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.122
-You go from female--

14:42.162 --> 14:42.980
-Fraser: No! I--

14:43.020 --> 14:43.980
We were told for ages that we

14:44.020 --> 14:45.760
were either males or females,

14:46.000 --> 14:46.881
okay? And that was that.

14:46.921 --> 14:47.980
Males would do certain things

14:58.026 --> 14:58.980
It's not even binary.

14:59.020 --> 14:59.327
-You get it?

14:59.367 --> 15:00.747
-Caitlin: I'm not sure.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.497
-Fraser: You know

15:01.537 --> 15:01.683
what a fever is?

15:01.723 --> 15:01.980
-Caitlin: Sure.

15:02.020 --> 15:02.435

15:05.000 --> 15:05.443
A fever is a symptom

15:05.483 --> 15:05.980
that your body is sick.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.916
-Caitlin: You're telling me

15:07.870 --> 15:08.980
-No! I'm telling you that--

15:07.956 --> 15:09.020
my body's sick?

15:09.020 --> 15:09.461
It's like a fever.

15:09.501 --> 15:09.980
It is, but it isn't.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.715
It's like a symptom

15:11.755 --> 15:12.622

15:12.662 --> 15:13.980
you discover real life.

-Fraser: Yeah.

15:42.381 --> 15:44.000
-Do you like him?

15:46.000 --> 15:46.503
I see how you

15:46.543 --> 15:46.980
look at him.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.895
-What are you talking about?

15:48.935 --> 15:49.980
-You're nervous.

15:50.020 --> 15:50.887
-(music stops)

15:50.927 --> 15:52.000
-I'm not nervous.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.320

Stop it. Stop.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.580
-Please? Please?

16:03.620 --> 16:04.000
-No!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
(gasp) Wow.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's so cool.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
(both giggle)

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Stop!

(kitchen clatter)

16:24.020 --> 16:24.467
Sarah:

16:24.507 --> 16:26.980
He is my type, but not my kind.

16:27.020 --> 16:27.369
Maggie:

16:27.409 --> 16:28.980
You've become very schematic.

16:29.020 --> 16:31.215
-Sarah: Don't you like it?

16:31.255 --> 16:32.000
-Depends.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Look at me.

-(shuts off water)

-(taps razor)

16:53.020 --> 16:54.574
Okay, but, uh, uh,

16:54.614 --> 16:55.980
keep it straight

16:56.020 --> 16:56.425
and parallel to

16:56.465 --> 16:56.980
your skin, alright,

16:57.020 --> 16:59.000
and just go down smooth.

17:01.000 --> 17:01.488
-(giggles)

17:01.528 --> 17:02.335
-Okay, if you're gonna laugh,

17:02.375 --> 17:02.980
it's not gonna work

17:03.020 --> 17:03.834
-'cause you're

17:03.874 --> 17:04.456
gonna cut yourself.

17:04.496 --> 17:05.216
-(splashing)

17:07.000 --> 17:07.492
Hold on.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.000
Don't move, don't move.

17:13.000 --> 17:13.980
(shutter snap)

17:14.020 --> 17:16.000
It's monumental.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.180
-Sarah: Fraser! Sweetheart!

17:18.220 --> 17:18.980
-Fuck, fuck, fuck!

17:19.020 --> 17:20.980
(splashing)

17:21.020 --> 17:23.980
Fraser! Caitlin! Dinner's ready!

17:24.020 --> 17:27.000
(water draining)

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Do I smell like shaving cream?

17:33.000 --> 17:33.552
(sniffing)

17:33.592 --> 17:34.980
Unless you're thinking of

17:35.020 --> 17:36.117
kissing them on the mouth,

17:36.157 --> 17:37.357
I think you're fine.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.980
I broke up with Sam.

17:40.020 --> 17:40.982
-Really?

17:41.022 --> 17:42.190
-Yeah, I get the feeling

17:42.230 --> 17:43.980
people think we're dating.

17:44.020 --> 17:44.504
-What?!

17:44.544 --> 17:45.219
-Come on. It'll make

17:45.259 --> 17:45.980
you more popular.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.520
I don't wanna be popular!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.980
(cork squeaking)

17:50.020 --> 17:51.224
-You put in the red onion?

17:51.264 --> 17:51.980
-Maggie: Mm-hmm.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.000
Hey, chef. Check your dish.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.947
-Fraser: Thanks.

17:56.987 --> 17:58.007
-(Maggie giggles)

18:00.000 --> 18:01.744
-Maggie: Looks good.

18:01.784 --> 18:03.000
-Fraser: Stop.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.838
Sarah:

18:04.878 --> 18:05.980
Caitlin.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.000
(pots clattering)

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You take that seat.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.926
Sweetheart, could

18:14.966 --> 18:15.326
you dim the lights?

18:15.366 --> 18:16.446
I have a headache.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Thank you.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.980
(sighs) Fucking God.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.959
-Uh, where's the cream?

18:31.999 --> 18:32.980
-(rummaging)

18:33.020 --> 18:34.980
You didn't get the cream.

18:35.020 --> 18:35.933
Didn't I tell you to

18:35.973 --> 18:36.980
buy a bottle of cream?

18:37.020 --> 18:38.980
You never listen to me.

18:39.020 --> 18:39.930
So alright,

18:39.970 --> 18:40.745
maybe I didn't tell you,

18:40.785 --> 18:41.980
but the dish needs cream.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.980
It needs cream!

18:44.020 --> 18:44.980

18:48.000 --> 18:49.980
(mellow music playing)

18:50.020 --> 18:50.899
So, this is

18:50.939 --> 18:52.000
a local dish?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.480
Yes. I soaked

18:55.520 --> 18:56.980
the stockfish

18:57.020 --> 18:57.980
for, uh, three days,

18:58.020 --> 18:59.234
and I used Parmesan.

18:59.274 --> 19:00.980
I used real-- real Parmesan,

19:01.020 --> 19:01.985
not like the kind

19:02.025 --> 19:02.980
we eat back home.

19:03.020 --> 19:05.000
It's interesting.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.220
Okay, it's fucking

19:16.260 --> 19:16.980
disgusting.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.157
-No, it's not. It's unusual.

19:18.197 --> 19:18.980
-No, it's actually--

19:19.020 --> 19:19.906
-it's fucking disgusting.

19:19.946 --> 19:20.470
It's revolting! Don't eat it!

19:20.510 --> 19:20.980
-Don't be so hard--

19:21.020 --> 19:22.717
-Nobody eat it, nobody eat it,

19:22.757 --> 19:23.324
nobody eat it... Fuck!

19:23.364 --> 19:23.980
-Just leave it!

19:24.020 --> 19:25.266
Nobody eat-- Stop eating!

19:25.306 --> 19:26.146
Nobody eat it!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.023
We should just go back to our

19:29.063 --> 19:30.683
usual weekly fucking roast.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.692
Your roast is delicious.

19:33.732 --> 19:34.980
Isn't it, Caitlin?

19:35.020 --> 19:35.371
-Yeah.

19:35.411 --> 19:36.980
-Try some farofa with it.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.040
(music continues)

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
That's a cute T-shirt.

19:45.000 --> 19:45.980
You bought it for me.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.063
-Did I?

19:47.103 --> 19:48.000
-Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:49.940
Remember his

19:49.980 --> 19:51.000
turban phase?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Sarah, don't.

19:55.000 --> 19:55.438
When he was

19:55.478 --> 19:55.980
a little boy,

19:56.020 --> 19:56.786
he used to put

19:56.826 --> 19:57.980
together these looks.

19:58.020 --> 19:58.193
-Mm-hmm.

19:58.233 --> 19:59.960
-(laughs) And he'd get a towel

20:00.000 --> 20:00.953
and wrap it on his

20:00.993 --> 20:01.980
head like a turban.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.906

20:02.946 --> 20:03.980

20:10.020 --> 20:11.013
What was that song?

20:11.053 --> 20:11.980
It was like, uh...

20:12.020 --> 20:13.342
Lady Gaga. The one where

20:13.382 --> 20:14.980
they're all red in the video.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.980
I can't... b-breathe...

29:07.020 --> 29:08.103
-Sarah: Come here, baby.

29:08.143 --> 29:08.980
-(hyperventilating)

29:09.020 --> 29:10.111
What is it? It must've

29:10.151 --> 29:10.980
been a bad dream.

29:11.020 --> 29:12.307
-(grunting)

29:12.347 --> 29:14.000
-Shh... shh...

29:15.000 --> 29:16.394
-It's okay, baby. Shh...

29:16.434 --> 29:16.980
-(gasping)

29:17.020 --> 29:17.556
Come here.

29:17.596 --> 29:18.980
Where does it hurt? Here?

29:19.020 --> 29:20.298
-Fraser: Here.

29:20.338 --> 29:21.450
Right here, Mommy.

29:21.490 --> 29:21.980
-Shh...

29:22.020 --> 29:22.675
-(crying)

29:22.715 --> 29:24.000
-Come here, baby.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.020
Come here. Shh...

29:28.000 --> 29:29.447
First time he couldn't

29:29.487 --> 29:30.980
breathe was in Morocco.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.111
Shh...

29:32.151 --> 29:33.980
-(panting)

29:34.020 --> 29:35.007
-Can't remember

29:35.047 --> 29:36.526
because you were just a baby.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.066
-(grunt)

29:38.000 --> 29:39.670
I kissed your back

29:39.710 --> 29:40.980
over and over,

29:41.020 --> 29:42.980
saying hush...

29:43.020 --> 29:45.000
Hush...

29:46.000 --> 29:46.807
-Mommy's here.

29:46.847 --> 29:47.980
-(breathing relaxes)

29:48.020 --> 29:49.517
Nothing's gonna happen to

29:49.557 --> 29:51.000
you 'cause Mommy's here.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
(sighs)

29:55.000 --> 29:56.255
-(birds chirping)

29:56.295 --> 29:58.000
-(neighborhood chatter)

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
(garage door closing)

30:04.000 --> 30:05.980
(starts Jeep)

30:06.020 --> 30:07.259
Woman (on radio):

30:07.299 --> 30:07.998
We all need to remember

30:08.038 --> 30:08.980
that service members

30:09.020 --> 30:10.152
who are involved in

30:10.192 --> 30:11.980
potentially concussive events,

30:12.020 --> 30:13.212
they're required to come in

30:13.252 --> 30:13.980
and get evaluated

30:14.020 --> 30:15.535
within 24 hours.

30:15.575 --> 30:16.980
The sooner that

30:17.020 --> 30:18.062
you get treatment, the sooner

30:18.102 --> 30:18.980
that you rest your brain,

30:19.020 --> 30:20.080
the sooner you're gonna

30:20.120 --> 30:20.980
get back to health.

30:21.020 --> 30:21.380
The Reconnect

30:21.420 --> 30:21.980
with America Program

30:22.020 --> 30:25.000
is focusing on reaching out...

30:27.000 --> 30:27.980
(cuts engine)

30:28.020 --> 30:28.980
(slams door)

30:29.020 --> 30:32.000
(base chatter)

30:41.000 --> 30:42.783

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
(beep, door unlocks)

30:51.000 --> 30:51.479
Soldier:

30:51.519 --> 30:53.000
Good morning, Commander.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
(door shuts)

31:18.000 --> 31:19.073
Hillary Clinton (on TV):

31:19.113 --> 31:19.980
That is the only way

31:20.020 --> 31:21.560
we can turn our

31:21.600 --> 31:24.000
progressive platform...

31:26.000 --> 31:26.881
Commander, good morning.

31:26.921 --> 31:28.661
I wasn't expecting you today.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.980
(applause on TV)

31:31.020 --> 31:32.000
Just Sarah.

31:33.000 --> 31:33.438
Can you get

31:33.478 --> 31:34.258
used to that?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.763
-Where is everyone?

31:37.803 --> 31:38.980
-At Chioggia.

31:39.020 --> 31:41.000
There is a festival.

31:43.000 --> 31:43.818
Could you get me

31:43.858 --> 31:44.980
a list of the soldiers

31:45.020 --> 31:45.826
who are about to

31:45.866 --> 31:46.980
deploy to Afghanistan?

31:47.020 --> 31:47.980
Colonel Poythress reported

31:48.020 --> 31:49.052
that the men are

31:49.092 --> 31:49.980
not ready yet.

31:50.020 --> 31:51.089
He said it's too

31:51.129 --> 31:52.000
short notice,

31:53.000 --> 31:53.876
and that they need

31:53.916 --> 31:54.980
their 90 days of prep.

31:55.020 --> 31:55.854
Sometimes

31:55.894 --> 31:58.000
we don't have 90 days.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.712
Send a note to the Theater

32:01.752 --> 32:02.980
Garrison Commander.

32:03.020 --> 32:03.951
Tell him the men's equipment

32:03.991 --> 32:04.980
are ready, and so are the men.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.687
Don't make it too formal.

32:06.727 --> 32:07.980
He's a good friend.

32:08.020 --> 32:08.843
Clinton:

32:08.883 --> 32:09.705
But we usually focus

32:09.745 --> 32:11.005
on how it turned out.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
(TV chatter continues)

32:18.000 --> 32:19.980
(door shuts)

32:20.020 --> 32:22.980
My type, not my kind.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.000
(men whistling, chattering)

32:28.000 --> 32:29.980
(splashing)

32:30.020 --> 32:34.000

32:45.927 --> 32:47.980
-(neighbors chattering)

32:48.020 --> 32:50.065
-He lost two key players.

32:50.105 --> 32:50.694
-Yeah. They were really

32:50.734 --> 32:51.980
powerful, weren't they?

32:52.020 --> 32:55.000
(conversation continues)

33:00.000 --> 33:01.140
(shuts door, locks)

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
(dog barking)

33:09.000 --> 33:10.480
Hey, Maggie! You're not

33:10.520 --> 33:12.000
coming to the festival?

33:13.000 --> 33:13.890
-What festival?

33:13.930 --> 33:14.339
-What do you mean,

33:14.379 --> 33:14.980
"What festival?"

33:15.020 --> 33:15.734
Chioggia!

33:15.774 --> 33:17.000
You gotta come!

33:18.000 --> 33:19.980
No, thank you.

33:20.020 --> 33:20.695
But it only

33:20.735 --> 33:21.980
happens once a year!

33:22.020 --> 33:23.451
-You can't miss it!

33:23.491 --> 33:23.944
-Jennifer: Maybe she

33:23.984 --> 33:25.244
doesn't want to come.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.980
(radio playing)

33:29.020 --> 33:29.791
Neighbor 1:

33:29.831 --> 33:30.911
I'm not kidding. They're going

33:30.951 --> 33:31.980
to close off the canals

33:32.020 --> 33:33.980
in Chioggia in 48 hours.

33:34.020 --> 33:35.647
-Neighbor 2: Not today, I hope.

33:35.687 --> 33:36.980
-No, of course not today!

33:37.020 --> 33:38.486
Not with the parade.

33:38.526 --> 33:39.980
They've got to get--

33:40.020 --> 33:41.320
-clean them out.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.980
-How does that work?

33:43.020 --> 33:43.627
Neighbor 1:

33:43.667 --> 33:44.166
I don't know. They stop

33:44.206 --> 33:44.980
the water from flowing--

33:45.020 --> 33:46.354
Could you please

33:46.394 --> 33:47.980
turn the volume up?

33:48.020 --> 33:49.073
-Neighbor 2:

33:49.113 --> 33:49.825
I love Italian songs.

33:49.865 --> 33:50.980
-(radio plays louder)

33:51.020 --> 33:51.468
(louder):

33:51.508 --> 33:52.980
But, how do they clean them?

33:53.020 --> 33:54.065
They can't suck up the mud

33:54.105 --> 33:55.425
with a vacuum cleaner.

33:56.000 --> 33:56.955
Neighbor 1 (louder):

33:56.995 --> 33:57.204
Of course they're not

33:57.244 --> 33:57.980
gonna use a vacuum cleaner.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.930
Maybe some sort of pump.

33:59.970 --> 34:00.980
I don't know.

34:01.020 --> 34:01.402
Somehow,

34:01.442 --> 34:02.980
they'll drain the water out...

34:03.020 --> 34:07.000
(Italian pop music playing)

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
(Italian singing continues)

-(church bell ringing)

34:28.280 --> 34:30.000
-(street chatter)

34:50.000 --> 34:51.902
-Neighbor 2: You should

34:51.942 --> 34:52.554
try the sardine in  saor.

34:52.594 --> 34:53.980
-Maggie:  Sarde  in  sabor.

34:54.020 --> 34:54.877
Neighbor 2:

34:54.917 --> 34:55.968
No,  saor  . Not  sabor  .

34:56.008 --> 34:56.980
They're exquisite--

34:57.020 --> 34:57.801
Jennifer:

34:57.841 --> 34:58.039
Mel! I forgot

34:58.079 --> 34:58.980
the cake in the car!

34:59.020 --> 34:59.946
Leave it.

34:59.986 --> 35:01.980
It's not important.

35:02.020 --> 35:02.541
It is important

35:02.581 --> 35:02.980
for Richard.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.049
But the parade is

35:04.089 --> 35:05.000
about to start.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.231
-(catches keys)

35:07.271 --> 35:08.000
-See you!

35:11.000 --> 35:11.229
Maggie:

35:11.269 --> 35:11.980
Let me come with you.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.049
-That's not necessary.

35:13.998 --> 35:15.018
-But I'd like to.

35:14.089 --> 35:17.000
Thank you.

35:17.000 --> 35:17.980
I'm so sorry...

36:02.000 --> 36:02.627
Britney:

36:02.667 --> 36:03.593
So this is what we've become?

36:03.633 --> 36:04.980
We're on one side of the street,

36:05.020 --> 36:06.005
and they're on the other.

36:06.045 --> 36:06.980
It's like we're enemies,

36:07.020 --> 36:07.795
-you know?

36:07.835 --> 36:08.697
-Craig: No! They're just on

36:08.737 --> 36:09.980
the other side of the street

36:10.020 --> 36:10.880
-because Sam can't

36:10.920 --> 36:11.300
pull himself together.

36:11.340 --> 36:11.980
-Britney: Well, yeah.

36:12.020 --> 36:12.382
Danny:

36:12.422 --> 36:14.000
It's always Caitlin Day.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.500
I mean, look at her, man.

36:17.000 --> 36:17.421
She always gotta be

36:17.461 --> 36:17.980
the center of attention.

36:18.020 --> 36:18.584
Craig:

36:18.624 --> 36:19.684
Oh my gosh, you guys are

36:19.724 --> 36:20.980
being so over-dramatic!

36:21.020 --> 36:21.984
She's not doing

36:22.024 --> 36:22.142
anything wrong!

36:22.182 --> 36:22.980
Look at-- look at Val!

36:23.020 --> 36:24.985
Isn't she beautiful?

36:25.025 --> 36:25.980
Val! Vale!

36:26.020 --> 36:28.000

36:50.000 --> 36:51.660
Oh my God. I just discovered

36:51.700 --> 36:53.020
that I love the drums.

36:54.000 --> 36:54.480
Britney:

36:54.520 --> 36:55.000
Caitlin!

Brit, wait!

37:17.020 --> 37:17.631
-Britney: Sam!

37:17.671 --> 37:18.980
-Hey! Hey! Are you happy now?

37:19.020 --> 37:20.633
-What are you talking about?

37:20.673 --> 37:21.214
-You broke up my group,

37:21.254 --> 37:21.980
you selfish bitch!

37:22.020 --> 37:23.122
Your group? I started it.

37:23.162 --> 37:23.980
You don't own shit.

37:24.020 --> 37:24.562
-It's always been my group.

37:24.602 --> 37:24.980
-Touch me. Touch me.

37:25.020 --> 37:25.355
Danny:

37:25.395 --> 37:26.980
It's always been my group.

37:27.020 --> 37:28.135
-Bitch. It's always

37:28.142 --> 37:28.980
-Caitlin: Back the fuck up.

37:28.175 --> 37:29.020
been my group.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.083
-What you gonna do about it?

37:30.123 --> 37:30.980
-Fraser: Danny, Danny--

37:31.020 --> 37:32.488
-Danny: Hey, shut the fuck up!

37:32.528 --> 37:33.980
-Caitlin: Dude, what the fuck?

37:34.020 --> 37:35.049
-I don't care who

37:35.089 --> 37:35.332
your mother is.

37:35.372 --> 37:36.332
-Get off of him!

37:37.000 --> 37:37.940
I'll fucking kill you.

37:37.980 --> 37:38.577
I will fucking kill you,

37:38.617 --> 37:38.980
you hear me?

37:39.020 --> 37:40.127
-Okay, come on, man!

37:40.167 --> 37:40.200
Get off of him!

Let's just go.

38:00.055 --> 38:00.980
Fuck this festival.

38:01.020 --> 38:01.653
Britney:
