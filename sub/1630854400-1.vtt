WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:06.267
<i>Randall,
that is so surprising.</i>

00:06.267 --> 00:08.051
I was surprised, too,
Bibi, but it's true.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.097
The French Bulldog
has been voted

00:10.097 --> 00:13.448
the most popular small dog
in North America.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.276
I think
Cheese would agree with that.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.104
Wouldn't you, Cheese?
all: Aww.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.409
I think she would, Bibi.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.544
And I don't know
why she has to dress like me.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.421
In more serious news,

00:30.421 --> 00:33.511
Americans continue to miss
their morning cup of joe

00:33.511 --> 00:36.993
thanks to the ongoing
global coffee bean shortage.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.691
The lack of caffeine
is fueling the collective ire

00:39.691 --> 00:42.259
against President Taft,
who was caught enjoying

00:42.259 --> 00:44.522
<i>an affogato
at a private event.</i>

00:44.522 --> 00:47.090
<i>Affogato-gate has
many citizens wondering</i>

00:47.090 --> 00:48.265
<i>if they would have
been better off</i>

00:48.265 --> 00:50.093
<i>with Dwayne Johnson
as president.</i>

00:50.093 --> 00:51.529
Randall,
you've spent a lot of time

00:51.529 --> 00:53.836
with then-candidate Johnson
on the campaign trail.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.404
- He's my best friend, yes.
- So where's he been, Babe-ili?

00:56.404 --> 00:59.102
I mean, it's been a full year
since the election,

00:59.102 --> 01:01.539
and no one has seen
Dwayne Johnson.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.542
Official word is, he decided
to step out of the public eye

01:04.542 --> 01:08.198
to focus on family,
businesses, and charities

01:08.198 --> 01:10.070
until yesterday...

01:10.070 --> 01:13.508
<i>when the elusive Johnson
was spotted in a parking lot.</i>

01:13.508 --> 01:15.510
- What's your name, champ?
- Nico.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.207
Nico.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.253
You doing good, Nico?
You stayin' strong?

01:19.253 --> 01:21.211
Yeah, I wish
you were president, though.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.518
Yeah, you and my mom.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.042
My mom says
it must be hard

01:26.042 --> 01:27.609
knowing America
doesn't need you.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.132
<i>all: Ooh.</i>

01:29.132 --> 01:31.134
<i>Okay, uh,
let's go meet Dad.</i>

01:31.134 --> 01:34.094
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ouch.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.312
Whew.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.575
Um, we have
to take a quick break.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.838
This is "Chatter Box"
with Randall Park.

01:39.838 --> 01:42.580
And Bibi Storrs.
We'll be right back.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.713
Okay, and we're live again
in five, everyone.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.154
You about to send a nude?

01:51.154 --> 01:52.677
Don't.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.684
Bibi, ugh, I swear.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.210
Hey, Dwayne!
- Hey.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
Oh, man.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.952
Oh, my God.

02:06.952 --> 02:10.086
Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Good to see you. Yup.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.959
Aw.
- Aw!

02:13.959 --> 02:16.005
Aww!

02:16.005 --> 02:18.181
This feels like home.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.269
You gonna let go?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.836
There we go. Ahh.
- Yes. Yes.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.098
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.708
All right.
Come on in.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.928
You know, I haven't seen you
since we recorded voiceover

02:25.928 --> 02:27.059
for that movie "Huskies."

02:32.064 --> 02:33.718
I want to be a husky.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.591
And one day,
we will be.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.288
Great film, huh?
- Yeah.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.160
Are you excited
about the sequel?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.465
Wha--what sequel?

02:44.338 --> 02:45.469
Hey, man.
Yeah, so, uh, wha--

02:45.469 --> 02:46.992
what's up
with the emergency text?

02:46.992 --> 02:49.995
Um, I-I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.214
I saw the parking lot video.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.911
Oh, come on, Randall,
I'm fine.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.739
Totally fine.
Thank you for asking.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.523
Are you hungry?

02:55.523 --> 02:57.655
So are these bad boys.

02:57.655 --> 03:00.528
Uh, you know, I actually am,
like, really hungry,

03:00.528 --> 03:02.182
but I guess we can eat after.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.574
Yeah, fish first.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.621
- So you sure you're good?
- Yes, man, I am great.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.493
And I'm so happy that I'm not
running for president anymore.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.626
I don't have to be perfect.
I don't have to be polished.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.193
I can finally be myself again.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.325
I can roll around
in my pickup truck.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.892
I can tell my dirty jokes,

03:16.892 --> 03:18.372
like the one
about the Catholic pig.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.069
Did I ever tell you that one?
- No.

03:20.069 --> 03:23.203
All right, so a Catholic pig
walks into the doctor's office.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.770
And [bleep].

03:25.770 --> 03:28.164
And the doctor said,
"You want me to do what?"

03:28.164 --> 03:30.732
And the pig goes [bleep].

03:30.732 --> 03:32.255
And [bleep]...

03:32.255 --> 03:34.605
bagpipes [bleep].

03:34.605 --> 03:36.346
And then that's
when the squirrel walked in

03:36.346 --> 03:38.696
and [bleep].

03:38.696 --> 03:41.046
Then he said, "I gotta
make sure that thing fits."

03:42.526 --> 03:44.876
Can you imagine me saying that
on the campaign trail?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.270
I can't imagine
anyone saying that ever.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.881
I know, that's
why the joke is so awesome.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.361
No, look, I am good.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.016
And of course, the election
was a very public loss,

03:54.016 --> 03:58.281
but I've spent a lifetime
as a man in the arena,

03:58.281 --> 03:59.761
like that great
Teddy Roosevelt quote.

03:59.761 --> 04:00.936
Do you know that one?
- Mm.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.372
"It's not the critic
who counts..."

04:02.372 --> 04:04.026
- Mm-hmm.
- "The credit belongs

04:04.026 --> 04:06.550
to the man
who was actually in the arena."

04:06.550 --> 04:09.292
"And who at the worst,
if he fails,

04:09.292 --> 04:11.729
"at least fails
while daring greatly

04:11.729 --> 04:13.383
"so that his place
shall never be

04:13.383 --> 04:15.820
"with those cold
and timid souls

04:15.820 --> 04:19.041
who neither know victory
nor defeat."

04:19.041 --> 04:20.085
Powerful.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.348
Great man,
great moustache.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.263
Similar to my moustache, right?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.829
Mm.

04:24.829 --> 04:29.094
Randall, I have won and lost
in big arenas my entire life.

04:29.094 --> 04:33.011
Plus, I've also grown up with
men and women in the arena.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.535
And I can tell you firsthand

04:34.535 --> 04:37.538
the ups and downs
that come with all of that,

04:37.538 --> 04:39.061
<i>like when my dad found out</i>

04:39.061 --> 04:42.891
<i>he wasn't going to be on
the card for WrestleMania I.</i>

04:42.891 --> 04:45.720
<i>He went to Saudi Arabia
to wrestle for the WWF</i>

04:45.720 --> 04:47.417
<i>and possibly
an additional show</i>

04:47.417 --> 04:50.333
<i>with a promoter that my Uncle
Afa had connected him with.</i>

04:50.333 --> 04:52.335
Man, I love Riyadh.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.771
We haven't even
wrestled a match yet,

04:53.771 --> 04:55.164
and they're treating us
like stars.

04:55.164 --> 04:58.036
Hey, I love it, too, brother.
Look at this.

04:58.036 --> 05:01.170
We got gold chains sitting
out here next to cucumbers.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.608
Habibi,
are you Rocky Johnson?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.654
The one and only.
You got a pen or--

05:06.654 --> 05:08.699
I have a phone call for you.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.313
- Hello?
<i>- Rocky!</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:15.619
Pat Patterson.
- Pat?

05:15.619 --> 05:17.491
Hey, how--how--how did--
how did--how did you, uh--

05:17.491 --> 05:18.622
We know, Rock.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.972
- Know...?
<i>- We know!</i>

05:20.972 --> 05:22.974
Me and Vince know
you booked a show over there

05:22.974 --> 05:25.150
in Saudi Arabia
for some other promoter,

05:25.150 --> 05:28.458
<i>even though you're under
an exclusive contract with us.</i>

05:28.458 --> 05:30.373
I-I--uh,
you--you know,

05:30.373 --> 05:32.462
I thought
I'd fit in a show out here

05:32.462 --> 05:35.160
since you guys are busy
planning WrestleMania.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.207
'Ey, it's fortuitous.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.861
- It is?
<i>- It is!</i>

05:39.861 --> 05:41.906
Vince wants to open up
the Saudi Arabia market, too,

05:41.906 --> 05:43.821
you know.
A lot of money over there.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.780
So you'll lead the way internationally

05:45.780 --> 05:47.738
while Vince focuses
on WrestleMania.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.392
<i>He's betting the farm
on this one.</i>

05:49.392 --> 05:50.828
No one's ever done
a pay-per-view

05:50.828 --> 05:52.700
wrestling show before.
Are people gonna watch?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.919
I don't know.
What are we, boxing?

05:54.919 --> 05:56.399
Listen, tell Vince

05:56.399 --> 05:58.401
I'm gonna wrestle
for the WWF out here.

05:58.401 --> 06:01.622
Exclusively for us, yeah?
Not for some other promoter?

06:01.622 --> 06:03.101
Of course.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.930
I'm under contract with you,
and I'm gonna honor that.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.584
<i>That's it.</i>

06:07.584 --> 06:09.847
I'll let Vince know.
He'll be happy to hear it.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.807
Talk to you soon, Rock.
<i>- A'ight, thanks, Pat.</i>

06:12.807 --> 06:14.939
Now I just gotta tell Afa.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.513
Taxi!

06:26.734 --> 06:28.866
<i>Rocky made good
on his promise, though.</i>

06:28.866 --> 06:31.086
<i>He wrestled exclusively
for the WWF</i>

06:31.086 --> 06:34.394
<i>and opened up Saudi Arabia
as a new territory.</i>

06:34.394 --> 06:36.396
<i>And the fans loved him.</i>

06:36.396 --> 06:38.528
<i>There was just one problem:</i>

06:38.528 --> 06:40.269
<i>WrestleMania.</i>

06:40.269 --> 06:41.836
<i>It was groundbreaking,</i>

06:41.836 --> 06:44.316
<i>unlike anything
anyone had ever seen.</i>

06:44.316 --> 06:47.624
<i>Shattered records,
live attendance, pay-per-view.</i>

06:47.624 --> 06:49.452
<i>It was a phenomenon
that would change</i>

06:49.452 --> 06:51.715
<i>professional wrestling forever.</i>

06:51.715 --> 06:53.325
<i>Sometimes we think we're on top,</i>

06:53.325 --> 06:56.764
<i>but in reality,
the bottom has dropped out.</i>

06:58.809 --> 07:01.464
<i>Let me tell you
something, brother!</i>

07:01.464 --> 07:02.944
Yes, Afa, like I told you
when you called an hour ago,

07:02.944 --> 07:04.336
as soon as Rocky gets in
from his flight,

07:04.336 --> 07:05.555
I'll have him give you a ring.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.949
Sorry, I'm just so eager
to talk to him.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.299
That trip to Saudi Arabia
really bonded you two, huh?

07:10.299 --> 07:12.083
Oh, our relationship
will never be the same.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.390
Okay, fa.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.530
You think Dad and Hulk Hogan
will ever team up?

07:24.748 --> 07:28.099
Well, I guess
you can ask him yourself.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.014
- Champ's home!
- Dad!

07:30.014 --> 07:31.581
Hey, Dew!

07:31.581 --> 07:33.801
Oh, look at you.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.498
Thanks, buddy.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.239
There she is.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.677
I missed you, honey.

07:40.677 --> 07:41.939
Oh, I missed you too, babe.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.463
I missed both of you.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.249
Also, I picked you up
a little road gold.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.947
Oh, it is gorgeous,
but it looks expensive!

07:49.947 --> 07:51.558
Uh-uh, no buts.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.647
I took care of my lady

07:53.647 --> 07:56.650
and my boy.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.478
A Saudi Arabian Mazinga?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.479
Thank you!

08:01.524 --> 08:02.917
Awesome.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.093
Oh, I'm so glad things
went well for you out there.

08:05.093 --> 08:08.444
Me, too, babe.
Me too.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.620
Uh, actually,
I was thinking

08:10.620 --> 08:12.622
about that conversation we had
before I left,

08:12.622 --> 08:14.494
the one about
you breaking off from Lia

08:14.494 --> 08:16.496
and starting
our own promotion business.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.454
Funny, I've been thinking
about that a lot, too.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.500
Look, the--the way
things went overseas,

08:20.500 --> 08:23.981
it seems like I'm on this
rocket ship with the WWF.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.330
And who knows what territory

08:25.330 --> 08:27.202
they're gonna
have me open up next?

08:27.202 --> 08:29.509
It made me think that

08:29.509 --> 08:33.556
maybe we should hold off
starting our own promotion.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.516
You know, don't rock the boat
while the seas are smooth.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.954
I'm so relieved
to hear you say that.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.085
I agree with you!

08:41.085 --> 08:42.478
- Really?
- Yes!

08:42.478 --> 08:44.436
So you like working
with Lars Anderson?

08:44.436 --> 08:46.090
No!

08:46.090 --> 08:49.006
But I had this dream
last night.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.840
Sir, I'll take a malt.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.320
You need a ball?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.495
No, Mom, a malt.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.106
A ball?
Yes, I have one.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.067
Here you go,
my beautiful daughter.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.852
And this one is for you, too.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.680
And this one.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.595
Here is another.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.727
Mom, why do you
have so many--

09:13.727 --> 09:15.206
Wait, give one back.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.469
I'm thirsty.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.601
Thirsty?

09:26.304 --> 09:28.698
Could I bother you
for a baby melon, miss?

09:28.698 --> 09:31.309
I'm parched from delivering
the Gettysburg Address.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.573
Of course, Honest Abe.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.534
<i>And then Abe and my mom
started kissing,</i>

09:38.534 --> 09:39.666
<i>and that's when I woke up.</i>

09:41.102 --> 09:42.712
The hell
kind of dream is that?

09:42.712 --> 09:43.713
An informative one.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.324
Baseballs
symbolize opportunity.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.283
Watermelons mean vengeance.
- Okay.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.241
And Abraham Lincoln
is obviously a metaphor

09:50.241 --> 09:51.373
for my father, Peter.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.595
I agree with you.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.553
I'm gonna give working
with Lars and my mom a shot.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.860
Well, great.
That's all you had to say.

10:04.865 --> 10:05.996
That's probably Afa.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.084
He's been trying
to get ahold of you.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.739
- Nuh-uh, that can wait.
- Ah!

10:09.739 --> 10:10.914
Pack your bags.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.438
Vince invited all his VIPs

10:13.438 --> 10:16.137
to a big party
in New York City.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.836
<i>The WWF partnered
with Cyndi Lauper</i>

10:19.836 --> 10:21.446
<i>on her new music video,
"Good Enough,"</i>

10:21.446 --> 10:23.187
<i>from the movie "The Goonies."</i>

10:23.187 --> 10:24.798
<i>And Vince threw a party
to celebrate</i>

10:24.798 --> 10:26.495
<i>the video's premiere.</i>

10:26.495 --> 10:28.149
<i>And my dad was ready
to celebrate</i>

10:28.149 --> 10:30.368
<i>his success in Saudi Arabia.</i>

10:30.368 --> 10:33.720
Oh, there are
so many famous people here.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.765
That's what other people
are sayin' about us.

10:35.765 --> 10:39.116
Dad, you gotta introduce me
to Hulk Hogan.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.118
Except my son,
who keeps me grounded.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.469
Wow, Mr. T?

10:44.469 --> 10:46.123
Let me tell you something, Chunk.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.472
You make me laugh.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.822
You make me laugh, too,
Mr. T.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.301
How so, Chunk?

10:55.045 --> 10:57.178
Mm.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.527
Hey, look who it is.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.268
- Rocky Baba!
- Hey.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.661
We missed you
at WrestleMania, Rock.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.271
Yeah,
sorry I couldn't make it.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.752
Vince needed me
in Saudi Arabia

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
opening up
that international territory.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.669
That right?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.322
Hadn't heard about
the international thing.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.584
It's gonna be huge, Lou.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.977
I'll catch up
with Vince tonight

11:13.977 --> 11:16.676
and talk about which territory
I'ma open up next.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.720
Maybe Austria.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.200
Wrestle
some of them von Trapps.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.116
Is Hulk Hogan here?

11:22.116 --> 11:24.379
Hey, kid, what are we,
chopped liver?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.598
Yeah,
we definitely chopped liver.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.384
Come on, Dew.
Let's go find him.

11:29.384 --> 11:32.474
Just look
for the tan bald spot.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.703
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I direct your attention

11:43.703 --> 11:47.750
to the stage
for WWF Chairman Vince McMahon.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.803
Thank you all
for joining us tonight.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.893
Uh, boy, it's been
a special month for the WWF.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.373
As you know,
because the whole world knows,

12:02.373 --> 12:05.202
WrestleMania
was a phenomenal success!

12:06.726 --> 12:07.727
Yeah.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.902
And one of the big reasons why

12:08.902 --> 12:10.773
is a woman
I'm about to introduce.

12:10.773 --> 12:14.821
One of the great talents
of our time, Miss Cyndi Lauper!

12:17.780 --> 12:18.825
Thank you.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
- Yeah!
- Thank you, thank you.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.568
Well, Hulk said
he got a little nervous

12:23.568 --> 12:25.005
walking through the city
at night,

12:25.005 --> 12:26.746
so I said I'd escort him.

12:28.356 --> 12:32.403
You mess with me, you get
the 11 1/2-inch pythons.

12:32.403 --> 12:35.015
Whoo! Yeah!

12:35.015 --> 12:38.583
Anyways, I always felt like
rock music and wrestling,

12:38.583 --> 12:42.370
they belong together
like an unstoppable tag team.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.415
So I'm proud to introduce

12:44.415 --> 12:48.419
what the WWF and I made:
"Good Enough."

12:48.419 --> 12:50.813
<i>♪ Good enough for you</i>

12:50.813 --> 12:54.251
<i>♪ Is good enough for me</i>

12:54.251 --> 12:56.906
<i>♪ It's good enough</i>

12:56.906 --> 13:00.997
Yeah! Yeah!

13:02.477 --> 13:04.305
I'm not sure what this has
to do with "The Goonies,"

13:04.305 --> 13:05.915
but the video is great.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.396
It just would have been better
if I was in it.

13:08.396 --> 13:11.268
This video is
the best thing I ever saw!

13:11.268 --> 13:13.618
Look how strong my body looks!
Zoom it!

13:13.618 --> 13:14.794
I just don't understand

13:14.794 --> 13:16.752
what kinda gas station
I was running.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.322
Hey, brother,
got a minute?

13:21.322 --> 13:22.671
You're Rocky Johnson's kid, right?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.412
Uh--

13:24.412 --> 13:26.022
That headband you got on,
little man,

13:26.022 --> 13:28.764
it's a prototype,
the only one in existence.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.200
I was testing it out
for wearability

13:30.200 --> 13:31.593
before we mass-produce, brother.

13:31.593 --> 13:34.030
So I gotta ask you
to do the Hulkster a favor.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.553
You think I can have it back?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.991
Promise I'll send you a new one
in a few weeks.

13:37.991 --> 13:41.603
Uh, yeah. Here.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.605
I spilled
a little cream cheese on it.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.607
Duly noted, Hulkamaniac.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.696
Eat your vitamins!

13:47.696 --> 13:49.480
I will.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.266
Whoa.
Wait, which vitamins?

13:52.266 --> 13:55.443
Hey, kid, put your hand out.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.314
That's also one of a kind.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.229
Thanks, Cyndi Lauper.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.840
Well,
aren't you gonna wear it?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.102
It's kinda big.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.844
Just keep your hands open.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.193
That's it.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.977
What's your name?
- Dewey Johnson.

14:07.977 --> 14:11.415
Very cool, Dewey Johnson.
Very cool.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.637
They used my worst takes!

14:15.637 --> 14:18.335
I disagree.
I was there.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.511
And that was as good
as you gave them.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.123
Rocky.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.472
Hey, good to see ya.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.474
Hey, Vince.
Oh, good to see you, brother.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.867
How you doin'?
- Doing great. Doing great.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.998
Hey, can you do me a favor
real quick?

14:28.998 --> 14:30.217
Yeah.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.479
Can you get that knife out
of my back?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.350
Ahh!

14:36.353 --> 14:38.442
- Enjoy yourself.
- All right.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.576
<i>I didn't know what
"knife in the back" meant,</i>

14:41.576 --> 14:43.056
<i>but I knew it wasn't good.</i>

14:44.971 --> 14:47.190
- So Vince was mad?
- Yeah, Vince was pissed.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.757
But I thought
Pat said he was okay

14:48.757 --> 14:50.237
with what happened
in Saudi Arabia.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.934
My dad broke his contract
with Vince,

14:51.934 --> 14:53.066
and that's the bottom line.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.719
Now,
if WrestleMania had flopped,

14:54.719 --> 14:58.114
then maybe Rocky Johnson in
the international marketplace

14:58.114 --> 14:59.159
might have been a priority.

14:59.159 --> 15:03.032
But it didn't,
so he wasn't.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.165
Yeah,
work conflict can be rough.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.907
You know, my coworker, Bibi,
slightly lowered my chair

15:07.907 --> 15:11.040
because she thought I was
parking too close to her car.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.346
- Were you?
- Yes.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.782
There you go;
that's what happens

15:13.782 --> 15:15.958
when two people enter
the arena, Randall and Bibi.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.394
Yeah.
I hate her.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.005
You know that moment
at the party I told you about?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.310
That was the beginning

15:20.310 --> 15:22.617
of a real rough patch
in my dad's career.

15:22.617 --> 15:25.228
And it was also something
that I had experienced myself

15:25.228 --> 15:27.230
when I first started wrestling
for the WWE.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.363
This is when you were
wrestling under the name

15:29.363 --> 15:31.408
Rocky Maivia, right?
- That's right.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.454
Rocky Maivia,
Intercontinental Champion.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.544
The good guy, the babyface
who fans were supposed to love,

15:36.544 --> 15:39.373
but they hated me.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.636
<i>They were booing me in arenas
all across the country.</i>

15:41.636 --> 15:44.595
<i>They even booed me
right outta WrestleMania 13.</i>

15:44.595 --> 15:46.510
<i>Eventually, I realized
that they were only doing it</i>

15:46.510 --> 15:47.990
because
I wasn't being authentic

15:47.990 --> 15:49.296
and I wasn't being real.

15:49.296 --> 15:53.126
But in that moment back then,
I didn't know it.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.258
<i>That Intercontinental belt
on my lap</i>

15:55.258 --> 15:57.391
<i>meant I was one of the two
most important champions</i>

15:57.391 --> 15:59.436
<i>in the company,
but I felt like</i>

15:59.436 --> 16:01.873
<i>the biggest loser
in the world.</i>

16:01.873 --> 16:04.050
<i>Sometimes it could be really lonely</i>

16:04.050 --> 16:05.747
<i>when you're the man
in the arena.</i>

16:05.747 --> 16:09.185
<i>But as treacherous of a place
as a locker room can be,</i>

16:09.185 --> 16:10.534
<i>the empathy of the boys,</i>

16:10.534 --> 16:12.362
<i>even my most
competitive colleagues,</i>

16:12.362 --> 16:13.929
<i>that was something
I'll never forget.</i>

16:13.929 --> 16:16.671
Do you wanna wear my mask
for a little while?

16:16.671 --> 16:18.194
Like, to the store?

16:18.194 --> 16:19.326
Might cheer you up.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.197
I got 36 beers in my locker.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.764
Help yourself to all of 'em.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.808
I drew this for ya.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.071
What's that cloud thing?

16:25.071 --> 16:26.289
It's a fart.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.770
The fart's pushing you.

16:28.770 --> 16:32.295
<i>Meanwhile, Vince had seen
all he needed to see.</i>

16:32.295 --> 16:34.384
<i>You can only push someone
on the fans for so long.</i>

16:34.384 --> 16:36.473
Take the belt off the kid.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.648
Okay, boss.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.215
<i>So that's exactly
what happened.</i>

16:39.215 --> 16:41.043
<i>I lost the
Intercontinental Championship</i>

16:41.043 --> 16:42.827
<i>to my good buddy,
Owen Hart.</i>

16:42.827 --> 16:44.742
<i>As much as that sucked,</i>

16:44.742 --> 16:46.744
<i>at least things were better
outside the ring.</i>

16:46.744 --> 16:48.659
<i>Dany and I
had gotten back together.</i>

16:48.659 --> 16:50.748
<i>And soon after,
I moved back in with her.</i>

16:50.748 --> 16:52.707
Whoo!

16:52.707 --> 16:54.622
That was a good set.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.971
Right?
- Yes.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.017
There we go.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.194
Now you can see
all the spices you have.

17:01.194 --> 17:04.153
Oh, you're out of onion flakes.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.547
Thank you, Mrs. Johnson.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.765
There we go.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.246
Now you can remember
where you come from

17:10.246 --> 17:12.466
every time you walk in.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.729
And here's the bowl
for your keys.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.384
Thank you, Grandma.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.386
<i>She was rolling
with my family pretty well.</i>

17:19.386 --> 17:21.779
<i>And she even made it
to some of my matches.</i>

17:21.779 --> 17:24.913
<i>There was a section reserved
for wives and girlfriends,</i>

17:24.913 --> 17:29.004
<i>and Dany would come straight
from her job at Merrill Lynch.</i>

17:29.004 --> 17:31.441
So nice that you brought
your lawyer to the match.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.182
Ha!

17:33.182 --> 17:34.966
- That's my man.
- Yeah.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.230
<i>Unfortunately,
it felt like I was living out</i>

17:37.230 --> 17:39.623
<i>in pro wrestling
what happened to my dad.</i>

17:39.623 --> 17:42.278
<i>I went from being the champ
and wrestling on TV every week</i>

17:42.278 --> 17:43.758
<i>to wrestling sporadically,</i>

17:43.758 --> 17:46.587
<i>often not on TV,
and always losing.</i>

17:59.600 --> 18:01.167
<i>It was all
a little too familiar.</i>

18:01.167 --> 18:02.603
Ring the bell!

18:06.955 --> 18:08.652
One, two, there!

18:08.652 --> 18:10.741
Ring the bell!

18:10.741 --> 18:12.700
<i>My dad went
from wrestling in the WWF</i>

18:12.700 --> 18:14.484
<i>to wrestling
at used-car dealerships</i>

18:14.484 --> 18:16.051
<i>in less than two years.</i>

18:16.051 --> 18:18.053
<i>But he was still doing
everything he could</i>

18:18.053 --> 18:20.708
<i>to earn a living
and take care of our family,</i>

18:20.708 --> 18:22.231
<i>and I'll always love him
for that.</i>

18:22.231 --> 18:24.015
Why can't we
turn on the radio?

18:24.015 --> 18:25.756
Because
it drains the battery!

18:25.756 --> 18:29.151
You want me to buy a car
without testing the radio?

18:29.151 --> 18:31.066
Are you crazy?
- Who are we kidding?

18:31.066 --> 18:33.329
You can't afford this car!
- Hey!

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
- You struck my car?
- Oh, yeah!

18:35.157 --> 18:37.464
Oh, you better
get your hands off of me.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.639
Get outta my lot!
- Hey!

18:38.639 --> 18:40.031
Hey, look!
It's Rocky Johnson!

18:40.031 --> 18:42.164
I just wanna test the radio!

18:42.164 --> 18:44.471
You can't test the radio!

18:44.471 --> 18:45.602
Ahh!

18:45.602 --> 18:47.604
Hey, glasses, look!
He can't breathe!

18:47.604 --> 18:49.258
This is the best deal
you're gonna find!

18:49.258 --> 18:51.130
Watch the fight in the ring!

18:54.176 --> 18:55.960
Hell of a show, Dad.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.049
Hey, thank you, Dew.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.921
Crowd could have
been better, though.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.315
That fight by the old
Maverick pulled a lot of focus.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.055
That guy should have
let him turn on the radio.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.319
How's he gonna buy a car
without testing the radio?

19:08.669 --> 19:10.975
It'll probably be the last
match of mine you'll see

19:10.975 --> 19:12.803
before you head to Miami.

19:12.803 --> 19:16.329
Wish it was memorable
for a different reason.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.505
It's gonna be hard
being so far away from home.

19:18.505 --> 19:23.205
Ah, not as hard as
playing bigtime D-1 football.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.207
I'm ready.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.470
I know you are, son.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.472
Just remember,
it's a rare opportunity

19:29.472 --> 19:32.562
for an athlete to compete
on a stage that big.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.737
It's hard work getting there,

19:33.737 --> 19:35.435
and it's hard work
staying there.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.698
But you always gotta
give it everything you got.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.006
<i>My dad was giving me advice,</i>

19:42.006 --> 19:44.531
<i>but it also felt like
a pep talk for himself.</i>

19:44.531 --> 19:46.097
<i>But I took that with me,</i>

19:46.097 --> 19:49.405
<i>and it helped me during
that difficult time in 1997</i>

19:49.405 --> 19:53.017
<i>when I was doing
untelevised WWF house shows.</i>

19:53.017 --> 19:56.195
<i>The tougher things got around
me, the harder I worked.</i>

19:56.195 --> 19:58.066
<i>I was gonna rise
to the challenge</i>

19:58.066 --> 19:59.850
<i>and give it everything I got.</i>

20:03.854 --> 20:06.683
<i>Little did I know things
were about to get even harder.</i>

20:11.514 --> 20:13.821
That must have been so hard,
getting injured

20:13.821 --> 20:15.431
with everything up in the air
like that.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.780
Yeah, that was tough.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.696
And I had a long
and uncertain road ahead of me.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.263
But you've known me
long enough now

20:21.263 --> 20:24.832
to know that I've dealt
with a few failures in my life.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.486
So what was harder?

20:26.486 --> 20:27.835
Going down with that injury

20:27.835 --> 20:29.315
or losing
the presidential election?

20:29.315 --> 20:32.448
Oh, man, in a life
full of ups and downs,

20:32.448 --> 20:34.929
those were two real low points.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.105
But that's also part
of being the man in the arena.

20:37.105 --> 20:40.500
If I fail, at least I fail
while daring greatly.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.154
You know, in the case
of running for president,

20:43.154 --> 20:45.287
I think I just stepped
into the wrong arena.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.682
My place is not
in the world of politics,

20:48.682 --> 20:49.683
and I'm okay with that.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.380
- Hmm.
- Come on.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.297
Hold on one second.

20:55.297 --> 20:59.301
Ah, speaking of which,
an old buddy.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.042
What's up, Mr. President?

21:01.042 --> 21:03.044
Hi, Dwayne.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.175
How did you know this was me?

21:04.175 --> 21:05.786
- Taft?
- Is that Taft?

21:05.786 --> 21:07.570
Yeah, this is President Taft.

21:07.570 --> 21:08.876
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.052
I have the White House number
in my phone...

21:11.052 --> 21:13.228
and I'll update it later.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.925
Tell him I'm here
but I don't say hi.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.057
Randall's here
and he says hello.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.363
- No.
- All right, Mr. President.

21:17.363 --> 21:20.366
So... what's up?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
There's a national emergency, Dwayne.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.719
The people need you.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.329
What's going on?

21:29.679 --> 21:30.767
I think that's a good idea.
