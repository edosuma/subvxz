00:26.326 --> 00:29.000
-Stone.
-[Silas] <i>Victor, it's me.</i>

00:29.000 --> 00:30.199
How did you get this number?

00:30.199 --> 00:32.131
<i>-Does that matter?
-Does it matter?</i>

00:32.164 --> 00:34.798
<i>I didn't want to start
the new year without
my son in my life.</i>

00:34.798 --> 00:37.500
Meaning what I want
doesn't count, right?

00:37.500 --> 00:40.350
If I ask you a question,
you don't answer.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.950
If I beg you, beg you to come
to a game, you don't show!

00:43.950 --> 00:48.000
If I tell you I need space,
you ignore my wishes!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.280
<i>-Victor!
-Goodbye, Dad.</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:51.484
-Don't call back.

[Victor screams]

01:02.795 --> 01:04.364
Victor Stone!

01:04.397 --> 01:07.266
Oh, Fred Bugg has been
looking everywhere for--

01:07.299 --> 01:10.637
Victor Stone...

01:10.671 --> 01:13.438
Help! Hive drones!
Victor Stone needs help!

01:13.471 --> 01:15.242
-Fred, what is it?
-[Victor groans]

01:15.275 --> 01:19.914
I'm okay. Not murderous
or anything, but I guess...

01:19.947 --> 01:22.683
I guess Father Box
isn't done with me.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.584
-If it can't take my mind...
-[gasps]

01:24.617 --> 01:27.521
It will transform
my whole body

01:27.521 --> 01:33.021
until I'm nothing but
a walking, talking Father Box.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.379
[theme music playing]

02:03.790 --> 02:05.790
[Dr. Irons] [sighs]
You seem stable
for now, Victor.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.543
Doesn't feel that way.

02:07.543 --> 02:09.049
-[Mother Box clangs]
-[Dreamer] It shouldn't.

02:09.049 --> 02:11.250
Your condition is anything
but stable.

02:11.250 --> 02:14.264
Guys, this is Dreamer,
of the Forever People
of New Genesis.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.753
Figured we might need her help
to figure Vic out.

02:16.753 --> 02:17.972
[Mother Box clangs]

02:18.002 --> 02:20.407
Mother Box has run
a diagnostic.

02:20.407 --> 02:24.276
She believes your only hope
is to place you in
the Mobius Chair of Metron.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.550
The what of who?

02:25.550 --> 02:27.681
The New God Metron.

02:27.711 --> 02:31.585
He invented Mother Boxes,
Father Boxes and boom tubes
among other things.

02:31.616 --> 02:36.359
His Mobius Chair is the only
thing with a powerful enough
connection to the Source

02:36.359 --> 02:40.526
to purge Father Box's soul
from the technology
contaminating you.

02:40.526 --> 02:43.697
[Tara] She's gone!
[Fred] Violet Harper
has left the building!

02:43.729 --> 02:46.027
Stay. I'll see what this is.

02:46.598 --> 02:47.699
What's going on?

02:47.734 --> 02:50.704
Violet Harper/Halo is gone!

02:50.735 --> 02:54.372
"Thank you. Sorry.
Don't try to find me. V."

02:54.407 --> 02:57.342
[sighs] M'gann said
something's been
troubling Violet.

02:57.377 --> 03:00.413
I tried to get her
to talk to me,
but she wouldn't open up.

03:00.413 --> 03:03.616
We've talked,
but never about
her leaving us.

03:03.616 --> 03:04.930
[Tara] It is our fault.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.287
Violet confessed to us that
Gabrielle accepted a bribe

03:07.287 --> 03:10.256
to allow our parent's killers
into the palace.

03:10.288 --> 03:13.657
[sighs] Uh, well,
even if that is true,

03:13.693 --> 03:15.662
that was Gabrielle,
not Violet.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.032
-They're two different people.
-I know.

03:18.062 --> 03:21.501
But I did not react well.
Neither of us did.

03:21.532 --> 03:23.604
Okay, go back in.
I'll find her.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.348
[stammers]
I'd like to come with you.

03:25.348 --> 03:27.740
You're the doctor.
Vic needs you here.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.776
I'll bring Violet back.
I think I know how.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.036
You both need to
get ready for school.

03:33.036 --> 03:35.986
No. Forager must stay
with Victor Stone.

03:35.986 --> 03:37.681
And I need to help you
find Violet.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.717
It is the least I can do.

03:39.752 --> 03:43.455
Okay.
Extraordinary circumstances.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.491
[Dreamer] Do nothing.
Your resistance is low.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.693
The slightest stress could
allow Father Box's advance.

03:49.693 --> 03:53.633
I will leave Mother Box with
your friends, so that they may
bring Metron to you.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.836
-You're not coming?
-I must return to New Genesis.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.604
Hold your ears, Earthlings.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.674
[Mother Box clangs]

04:00.705 --> 04:04.443
Also, Bear struck Metron
last time we saw him.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.812
The presence of
the Forever People
might not be helpful.

04:07.812 --> 04:12.449
Mother Box will take you
to Metron and return you
upon your request.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.020
-Thank you.
-[portal closes]

04:15.055 --> 04:17.992
Mother Box,
please take us to Metron.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.526
[Mother Box clangs]

04:21.060 --> 04:22.896
Y'all are giving me
a headache.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.398
No more boom tubes
in the house.

04:25.432 --> 04:29.536
Please be careful.
I... I need you.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.038
[kisses]

04:31.071 --> 04:32.504
The feeling is mutual.

04:35.141 --> 04:38.591
Is Brion Markov coming?

04:46.653 --> 04:48.689
-Is that him?
-I think so.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.420
Metron! Stop!

04:50.990 --> 04:52.088
[Conner] Metron!

04:55.495 --> 04:57.745
[Forager gasps]

05:18.718 --> 05:21.187
My brother and I
were roughhousing.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.923
Mmm-hmm.

05:22.956 --> 05:26.146
Miss Megan.
Have you heard from Violet?

05:26.146 --> 05:27.579
She isn't in school.

05:27.579 --> 05:29.629
Violent's run away
from home, Harper.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.932
A lot of people
are worried about her.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.298
Do you know where she is?

05:34.298 --> 05:36.937
No, I don't know.
Honest.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.970
Though... It must be great
to have a lot of people
worried about you.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.000
Sphere, can you
help us find Violet?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.646
[Sphere hums]

05:48.014 --> 05:51.115
I'll take that as a yes.

[muffled talking]

06:26.199 --> 06:28.221
I am sorry.

06:28.254 --> 06:31.524
Since surface languages
were not designed to be
spoken underwater,

06:31.557 --> 06:33.800
I know being understood
has been difficult.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.930
And I imagine the last few
weeks trapped in this tank

06:36.930 --> 06:38.732
have been worse
than difficult.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.100
Still...

06:41.134 --> 06:43.593
Are you certain
you want to go?

06:44.805 --> 06:48.040
You are very brave.

My translation magic
is quite rusty.

Did you just speak Hindi?
Or am I speaking English?

-And more importantly--
-I knew it!

07:42.062 --> 07:44.932
You wouldn't talk to me.
So I asked Dr. Irons
for a favor.

07:44.963 --> 07:47.165
Please, Victor.
You are my son.

07:47.165 --> 07:49.855
I had to see you.
Had to help you.

07:49.855 --> 07:51.524

But not listen to me!

-The Father Box tech
has spread.
-Oh, you noticed?

I talked to you!

Forager's heard stories
of the old Promethean gods.

08:15.028 --> 08:20.891
But Forager never thought
Forager would actually stand
on the face of Gog!

08:21.800 --> 08:24.271

-There's Metron!

08:30.076 --> 08:31.745
[Forager] Oh, too late.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.014
Mother Box, follow Metron!

08:34.047 --> 08:36.897
[Mother Box clangs]

08:40.854 --> 08:42.589

[Superman grunting]

08:52.264 --> 08:54.768
My brother.

08:55.163 --> 08:57.740
Your emotions are clearly
affecting your condition.

Don't you think I know that?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.798
We need to slow this down.

09:00.798 --> 09:02.875
His best option is
a medically-induced coma.

09:02.908 --> 09:05.700
That's your solution?
Putting me in a coma?

09:05.700 --> 09:06.812
It's temporary.
And while you're under,

09:06.812 --> 09:08.682
you'll lose no more ground
against the Father Box.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.331
Please. Victor.
You must trust me.

09:13.331 --> 09:14.591
[sighs]

09:15.254 --> 09:17.855
No. I should do it.

09:17.889 --> 09:20.692
No one else should be
responsible for this.

09:21.927 --> 09:23.225
For him.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.767
I will bring you back, son.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.551
I promise.

09:31.884 --> 09:34.682
-[sighs]
-[cell phone rings]

09:34.682 --> 09:36.743
Excuse me.
This could be important

in good hands.

What are you doing here?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.701
-I mean, I'm glad
to see you but--
-It's a long story.

10:12.701 --> 10:13.913
What about you?

10:13.947 --> 10:17.115
Well, uh, Apokoliptan forces
staged a raid here.

10:17.149 --> 10:20.488
The Parademons attacked
local miners and while
we were saving them,

10:20.488 --> 10:23.123
the Furies boom tubed away
with stolen minerals.

10:23.157 --> 10:26.519
It's disappointing, but
we'll get 'em next time.

10:26.519 --> 10:28.500
[Metron]
There will be no next time.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.297
The mineral taken here
was the final element

10:30.331 --> 10:33.767
DeSaad and Granny required
for their device.

10:33.798 --> 10:36.437
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Granny?
Granny Goodness?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.802
Hey, I know this is
a weird time to ask,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.307
but would you be my best man?

10:40.341 --> 10:42.841
Of course. Wait. What?

10:42.875 --> 10:46.177
Hmm. 1.5 Kryptonians.

10:46.211 --> 10:47.447
Interesting.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.716
New God Metron must come
back with Forager

10:49.749 --> 10:52.019
to help Forager's friend
Victor Stone.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.951
That is not my function.

10:53.985 --> 10:56.355
Okay. That's great.
But we have a friend
back on Earth,

10:56.389 --> 10:59.192
a human who's being eaten
alive by Father Box tech.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.729
I see. Yes.

11:02.759 --> 11:04.831
I must return with you.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.629
Uh. Great.
Home, please, Mother Box.

11:08.629 --> 11:09.629
[Mother Box clangs]

11:10.870 --> 11:12.839
Hey, we'll talk later.

11:14.441 --> 11:18.327
I swear, no one makes
my head spin like that kid.

11:18.327 --> 11:20.245
No one.

11:20.278 --> 11:22.782
I saw your brother
this morning.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.384
He had a black eye.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.019
[sighs] I told you.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.989
Colin and I were roughhousing.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.422
Look, I know the drill.

11:30.422 --> 11:32.792
If I say anything, you have
to tell the authorities.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.796
Colin and I could wind up
in foster care and separated.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.428
So. Roughhousing.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.500
[speaking Arabic]

12:15.969 --> 12:17.571
King Orin of Atlantis,

12:17.605 --> 12:20.173
allow me to
introduce you to--

12:20.206 --> 12:23.341
-You never did tell us
your name.
-No.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.144
And I will not now.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.080
It is all right, child.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.048
You begin a new life
in Atlantis.

12:30.081 --> 12:33.553
You may choose a new name
when the time is right.

12:34.322 --> 12:35.322
Thank you.

12:35.322 --> 12:39.091
Um, Your Majesty,
if I might ask,

12:39.125 --> 12:41.360
why did you stop
being Aquaman?

12:41.394 --> 12:45.532
Ruling Atlantis is more than
enough responsibility for any
one person.

12:45.566 --> 12:49.836
It was always my intention
for Kaldur'ahm to become
the Aquaman when he was ready.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.903
And he most certainly
is ready.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.605
You honor me, my King.

12:53.639 --> 12:58.000
Your work with
the Justice League
honors all of Atlantis.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.947
News of your Outsiders
has reached us here
in Poseidonis.

13:00.980 --> 13:04.048
The Queen and I
were very impressed.

13:04.048 --> 13:07.620
Particularly with their defeat
of Professor Ivo.

13:07.653 --> 13:12.392
Yes. They did admirable work
under difficult circumstances.

13:12.426 --> 13:14.427
But apologies, my King.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.297
I must take our new friend
to a promised rendezvous.

13:17.331 --> 13:18.629
Of course.

13:18.666 --> 13:21.816
Godspeed, Kaldur'ahm.

13:28.077 --> 13:29.373
[Dr. Irons] Yes, I understand.

13:29.373 --> 13:32.187
There's not much you can do
if you don't find her before
it's too late.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.364
Goodbye.

13:33.364 --> 13:35.379
[phone beeps]

13:35.416 --> 13:37.618
I can't help noticing
you haven't said anything

13:37.649 --> 13:40.653
about Halo's flight.

13:40.687 --> 13:43.923
I understand that the truth
about Gabrielle
and your parents

13:43.923 --> 13:46.326
must have been
difficult to process.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.808
But you should know
that the King and Queen

13:48.808 --> 13:50.562
would be so proud of you now.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.499
You found your sister.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.369
And the work the two of you
have done together
as heroes...

13:55.402 --> 13:58.272
Well, it goes without saying
you are living up to

13:58.272 --> 14:01.609
everything your mother
and father hoped you both
would be.

14:01.642 --> 14:05.979
More than that,
the leadership you've shown
with the Outsiders

14:06.009 --> 14:09.014
is having its effect
back in Markovia.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.918
Your people are remembering
their love for you.

14:11.951 --> 14:16.951
And you're doing
your country proud.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.297
Who are you?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.499
Silas Stone
is Victor's father.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.043
Forager has seen Victor
looking at pictures of
Victor and Silas Stone.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.138
Is this the...

14:31.171 --> 14:32.306
Can he...

14:32.339 --> 14:34.139
This is Metron.
He can save Vic.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.610
There has been
a misunderstanding.

14:36.644 --> 14:39.998
I'm not here to save
this "Vic."

14:40.748 --> 14:44.500
I am here to watch him die.

14:44.682 --> 14:49.682
I have never seen a Father Box
completely override
an organic system.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.360
Such a thing
is worthy of study.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.562
Study it? You need to stop it!
My son is dying!

14:56.596 --> 14:58.296
Death is commonplace.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.600
You know,
according to Dreamer,

15:01.634 --> 15:03.570
we don't actually need Metron.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.854
Just his chair.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.744
You dare, mortal?

15:10.778 --> 15:15.081
I am a New God.
To me, you are 0.5 of nothing.

15:17.682 --> 15:21.721
If you're really a god,
then I guess you can
handle this!

15:21.754 --> 15:24.230
Put Vic in the chair!
Hurry!

15:27.125 --> 15:28.427
[Aquaman]
These are my parents.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.629
Sha'lain'a and
Calvin Durham.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.201
We are very pleased
you will be staying
with us, child.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.235
And I think I can
help you adjust.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.673
I'm from the surface world
myself. San Diego, California.

15:40.706 --> 15:45.541
Thank you, but would you
mind if I had a moment alone
with your son?

15:45.541 --> 15:47.811
-Of course not.
-Take your time.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.451
Are you unhappy
with this arrangement?

15:52.485 --> 15:57.057
No. No, I'm so grateful
for the hospitality.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.456
It is more than I ever
received up there.

15:59.493 --> 16:03.596
-But, Aquaman...
-Please, call me Kaldur'ahm.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.567
-Or simply Kaldur.
-All right, Kaldur.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.638
I think you are the one
who is unhappy.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.639
I know you lied to King Orin.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.109
-I--
-I do not know
what the lie was about,

16:16.109 --> 16:21.109
or why it mattered,
and I am certain your king
did not suspect.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.750
You think lying
makes you a bad man.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.052
But I have known bad men.

16:27.086 --> 16:30.490
And bad men do not feel
bad when they lie.

16:30.524 --> 16:35.173
You are a good man,
Kaldur'ahm.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.432
[Megan]
Let's talk about the gun.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.201
That was Violet's gun.
She was the one
caught with it.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.605
Let's say it was Violet's gun.

16:44.638 --> 16:46.504
Hypothetically.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.609
Why do you think she had it?

16:50.509 --> 16:53.245
Well, hypothetically...

16:53.278 --> 16:55.315
She may have wanted to get it
out of the house

16:55.349 --> 16:58.118
so that the alcoholic
who lives there wouldn't
hurt anyone with it.

16:58.149 --> 17:01.822
Right.
Because alcohol and firearms.
Not a good mix.

17:01.822 --> 17:03.221
[scoffs] Well, duh.

17:03.254 --> 17:05.790
And yet, you were
caught using both.

17:05.826 --> 17:09.864
Harper, you of all people
should know better than
to go down that path.

17:09.894 --> 17:11.529
-Okay, we're done.
-Fine.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.865
You don't wanna talk
about yourself,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.867
let's talk about your brother
some more.

17:15.903 --> 17:19.136
You know, I've seen plenty
of bruises on you, but...

17:19.136 --> 17:21.775
I've never seen any on Colin
before now.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.345
-Roughhousing, remember?
-Maybe.

17:25.376 --> 17:29.516
Or maybe you weren't there
to protect him because
you were in jail.

17:29.548 --> 17:33.617
Up to this point,
you've been the rock
for Colin to hide behind.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.622
But you're a kid, too.

17:35.653 --> 17:38.592
And the rock's cracking
under this pressure.

17:38.592 --> 17:42.192
Ask yourself
whom your silence
is shielding now.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.229
Colin... Or your father?

17:47.902 --> 17:50.738
I know you're afraid
of what comes next.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.441
But I am going to be there
to help you through it.

17:54.471 --> 17:59.673
And I believe it can be
better than what you
and Colin have now.

18:08.689 --> 18:11.086
Our dad hits us.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.760
[speaking Arabic]

18:20.731 --> 18:22.402
[in English]
None of that matters.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.635
I thought my disappearance
might make you broken,

18:24.671 --> 18:26.471
so I came here to fix you.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.875
-Why are you speaking
in English?
-And so oddly.

18:29.910 --> 18:33.846
I don't want to upset you.
Just give you closure.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.480
What happened to you
in Markovia?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.951
You don't even sound
like my daughter.

18:38.986 --> 18:43.126
I know Gabrielle would've
wanted you to see her
one last time.

18:43.126 --> 18:45.490
Now you sound like
you're not even Gabrielle.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.894
[sighs]
I'll tell you everything.

18:48.929 --> 18:53.365
But you probably won't
believe me and you
definitely won't like it.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.738
[grunting]

18:57.769 --> 18:59.971
Mother Box!
Tell the chair to save Vic!

19:00.007 --> 19:02.855
[Mother Box clangs]

19:09.548 --> 19:10.896
[screams]

19:19.759 --> 19:23.260
[Victor yells in pain]

19:23.296 --> 19:25.395
[Victor screaming]

19:26.396 --> 19:27.749
[screams]

19:34.942 --> 19:36.142
[groans]

19:41.413 --> 19:42.913
Did you see that?

19:42.950 --> 19:46.353
The soul of the Father Box
has returned to the source.

19:46.384 --> 19:49.923
Something similar must've
happened to Mother Box-
Gabrielle-Halo-Violet.

19:49.957 --> 19:51.892
[groans]

19:51.923 --> 19:54.692
Careful, son.

19:54.728 --> 19:57.297
Father Box has been purged.

19:57.327 --> 20:01.268
Your Vic is
all Mobius tech now.

20:01.298 --> 20:06.298
A missed opportunity
for study. A waste.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.375
I'm starting to see
why Bear punched this guy.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.314
Look. I know I'm not your
favorite human right now.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.016
But you mentioned
Granny earlier.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.415
Is your Granny the same
as our Gretchen Goode?

20:19.086 --> 20:22.834
No. And yes.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.365
You're stabilized.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.932
You'll be all right.

20:34.969 --> 20:36.919
I can go now.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.884
[in English]
You killed our Gabrielle!

20:50.884 --> 20:53.818
No, the traffickers killed
her and me.

20:53.854 --> 20:57.355
I didn't take Gabrielle's body
until after she was dead.

20:57.390 --> 21:02.390
And it's hazy.
But I believe I was trying
to fix her when I got...

21:02.693 --> 21:04.596
-Stuck.
-Stuck?

21:04.631 --> 21:07.101
You possess her body,
you unholy demon!

21:07.134 --> 21:10.938
I do not understand
much of what you have told us.

21:10.971 --> 21:14.842
But I do understand
you came here trying
to give us a gift.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.030
The only gift you could give.

21:17.030 --> 21:19.576
Are you forgiving this thing?

21:19.576 --> 21:20.614
[Nadia] Hush, Samad.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.981
Everyone reacts differently
to difficult times.

21:24.018 --> 21:25.750
You lost your brother.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.452
And I lost my husband
to Queen Bee's armies.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.688
And now I know
my daughter is gone, too.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.991
I have anger to spare.

21:34.028 --> 21:39.028
But before today,
I did not know what had
happened to my girl.

21:39.396 --> 21:43.425
You have given me the closure
you sought to give.

21:43.425 --> 21:46.769
And for that, I thank you.

21:50.544 --> 21:55.544
I hope you find peace
among your family.

22:40.557 --> 22:42.559
[Tara]
I received your message.

22:42.596 --> 22:44.064
Yes, I know my report is late.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.030
But that's because
I have nothing to report.

22:46.066 --> 22:48.835
It's been quiet here.
Dull even.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.836
Of course, Slade.

22:50.871 --> 22:53.640
I shall keep you posted.
Tara out.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.623
[phone beeps]

23:13.125 --> 23:15.162
[theme music playing]

23:15.192 --> 23:16.545
[beeping]

23:42.953 --> 23:44.453
[laughter]

23:50.700 --> 23:53.211
[Kaldur]
<i>Shh!</i>

23:58.163 --> 24:00.192
-[objects clattering]
-[glass breaking]

24:00.192 --> 24:01.192
[Kaldur]
<i>Dang it!</i>

24:01.192 --> 24:02.192
[laughing continues]
