WEBVTT

00:06.759 --> 00:10.513
In terms of M&A action,
we're hearing that Gojo and Waystar

00:10.513 --> 00:13.975
could seal their long gestated deal
as soon as tomorrow.

00:13.975 --> 00:17.186
Word is that regulatory concerns
have receded.

00:17.186 --> 00:19.438
So Lukas Matsson may soon
take control

00:19.438 --> 00:21.272
of the deceased Logan Roy's empire

00:21.272 --> 00:25.695
to add to his streaming, betting,
sports and socials, Everything App.

00:26.653 --> 00:27.821
All right.

00:28.697 --> 00:31.324
OK, OK.
Carpe the diem, people.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.953
Hey, hey!

00:34.412 --> 00:37.164
Telly, let's run this board
presentation, shall we?

00:37.164 --> 00:38.707
Yeah, great. Thanks.

00:39.374 --> 00:40.960
Good stuff.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.128
- So...
- What?

00:43.128 --> 00:47.258
Just Stewy, that was his guy.
Yeah, I don't think we got him.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.929
Cool.

00:54.389 --> 00:55.891
Really?

00:56.766 --> 00:59.395
Where is he?
Get me him direct.

00:59.395 --> 01:00.730
It might be smokescreen.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.648
I think, yeah, that'll be smokescreen.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.900
I can pull in Stew.

01:04.900 --> 01:07.944
Ken, I don't think we have
the shareholders,

01:07.944 --> 01:10.405
and I don't think we have
the board numbers to stop this.

01:10.405 --> 01:12.032
I'll get the votes.

01:12.782 --> 01:15.994
If we had more time,
but by tomorrow, Ken...

01:16.537 --> 01:20.041
You want to just outline the path here?

01:20.041 --> 01:22.668
OK, I got fucking me.
I got Ewan.

01:22.668 --> 01:25.046
I got Paul.
I got Dewi. Locked.

01:25.046 --> 01:27.423
So yeah?

01:27.423 --> 01:29.174
OK, great.

01:29.174 --> 01:31.843
- And...
- And I still think I can get Stewy.

01:32.677 --> 01:38.350
I think maybe Sonya, maybe Frank.
There are multiple, multiple routes.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.854
Right now, you have four,
and one of them...

01:41.854 --> 01:44.606
And is Roman even going to show?
Is he going to vote?

01:44.606 --> 01:46.275
Don't worry about Roman.

01:46.776 --> 01:49.236
- But just where does he stand?
- I don't know.

01:49.236 --> 01:52.156
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

01:52.156 --> 01:54.282
OK? I don't know.

01:55.785 --> 01:57.828
OK?
Does that make you feel better?

01:58.578 --> 02:00.956
I don't know where he is.
I don't know where he stands.

02:00.956 --> 02:04.502
But I got him. OK?
I fucking got this, Telly Bear.

03:36.176 --> 03:39.972
OK. I think I lost Stewy.
He's wonked.

03:39.972 --> 03:43.267
So that means we got Kendall
in the trunk,

03:43.267 --> 03:46.354
all trussed up and ready
to fucking bake. Yeah?

03:46.354 --> 03:47.730
- It's good.
- OK.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.733
Because, you know,
we got me, obviously. Here.

03:51.442 --> 03:56.238
Me, Simon, Frank,
Sandy, and Sandi locked.

03:56.238 --> 03:59.991
And then Stewy, look,
he talks a lot of shit,

03:59.991 --> 04:03.245
but I think he's going to stay.
He's not going to split.

04:03.245 --> 04:05.122
Because money, honey, right?

04:05.122 --> 04:10.877
So then we got Diane Liu, Sonya,
and then we have it.

04:11.379 --> 04:15.048
Then if we peel off Dewi, Paul,
and Ewan,

04:16.008 --> 04:20.680
then there's only, like,
Ken and Rome in the against.

04:21.055 --> 04:24.392
And Rome might not even show up
from whatever jerk dungeon

04:24.392 --> 04:27.436
he's being pity spanked in.
You happy?

04:27.436 --> 04:29.146
Very happy.
Very, yeah.

04:29.146 --> 04:31.148
- Yeah, good.
- Success, yeah.

04:31.148 --> 04:33.483
And I'm checking in on Frank.

04:33.483 --> 04:36.112
If you want to still do
the old school signing.

04:36.112 --> 04:39.448
- Perfect.
- You know, me as new CEO, yes?

04:39.448 --> 04:43.493
And your list?
You want to talk Tom?

04:43.493 --> 04:45.746
I know you've been thinking
about ATN,

04:45.746 --> 04:47.915
and just say out loud
it's no big deal for me.

04:47.915 --> 04:52.419
Well, we've had some initial, like,
vibe meets.

04:52.419 --> 04:54.797
Yeah, I mean, he's shitting himself.

04:54.797 --> 04:59.969
Well, the delta between a guy and
a 10x guy is obviously life and death.

04:59.969 --> 05:01.886
And ATN is central, so...

05:04.140 --> 05:06.559
Tom. Tom, yeah.
I don't know.

05:07.768 --> 05:10.396
- What do you think?
- Well, he's very competent.

05:10.396 --> 05:14.983
But if he irks you or it's
complicated, it is okay. Yeah?

05:14.983 --> 05:17.986
He is very plausible corporate matter,

05:17.986 --> 05:21.031
but he's also just a highly
interchangeable modular part.

05:21.031 --> 05:23.868
- And I would say that to his face.
- Okay.

05:23.868 --> 05:26.078
Okay, but if we wanted continuity,

05:26.078 --> 05:28.372
because there's been
a lot of changes,

05:28.997 --> 05:32.584
ATN is going gangbusters,
and he is well liked.

05:32.584 --> 05:36.464
So if you were to stay on,
that would also be okay with me.

05:36.464 --> 05:38.256
- Okay, good to know.
- Yeah.

05:38.256 --> 05:41.426
Separate feelings aside,

05:41.426 --> 05:43.554
Tom will honestly suck
the biggest dick in the room.

05:43.554 --> 05:45.056
That's just my assessment.

05:45.555 --> 05:48.016
- Love is in the air.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.478
Sorry. Excuse me.

05:52.187 --> 05:54.731
Yeah. Just one sec. Hi.

05:56.358 --> 05:59.819
Hello, darling.
How are things going?

05:59.819 --> 06:01.947
Yeah, fine. Good, thanks.

06:01.947 --> 06:08.579
Great. I just wanted to know if there
was any chance of you coming.

06:09.913 --> 06:11.791
Yeah, I mean, look, I would love to,

06:11.791 --> 06:15.835
but I think, you know,
fucking schedules and board,

06:15.835 --> 06:18.089
Yeah, I know, but,
well, there's somebody here

06:18.089 --> 06:20.633
I think you might want to see.

06:21.716 --> 06:28.641
I promise I wouldn't say, but it's one
of your brothers, and it's not Kendall.

06:30.726 --> 06:33.020
Okay. Well, let me crack the code.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.562
I just thought you'd like to...

06:34.562 --> 06:37.816
Yeah, well, let me have a think,

06:37.816 --> 06:42.071
but let's, yeah,
let's try and make this work. Shall we?

06:42.071 --> 06:43.363
Great.

06:49.370 --> 06:52.414
That okay? That profile bullshit?

06:52.414 --> 06:55.710
The cartoon?
I think it's funny.

06:58.211 --> 07:00.339
Look at me, look at me!

07:00.339 --> 07:04.843
'Cause I can get the journalist,
you know, maybe take the online?

07:04.843 --> 07:09.640
I don't give a fuck. People always try
to fucking get at me, you know?

07:09.640 --> 07:11.182
They can't.

07:11.975 --> 07:15.729
Look, that was an associate
of mine indicating

07:15.729 --> 07:17.064
they got a fix on Roman,

07:17.064 --> 07:19.774
so why don't I just fucking go
and nail Roman as well?

07:19.774 --> 07:23.361
It would be so nice just to get
unanimity across the board, you know?

07:23.361 --> 07:25.780
All of us smiling in public,

07:25.780 --> 07:28.825
just nice clean start
for the start of our reign.

07:28.825 --> 07:31.369
Yeah? 'Cause, corporate narrative,
if we're on separate sides,

07:31.369 --> 07:33.204
it looks like Lady Macbeth Part 2,

07:33.204 --> 07:38.919
and it would be nice,
in an abundance of caution,

07:38.919 --> 07:41.922
just to close nice.

07:41.922 --> 07:43.591
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

07:43.591 --> 07:48.470
Alright, call me whenever, wherever.
I'm available. Okay?

07:48.470 --> 07:50.765
- Let's fucking do this.
- Get him.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.477
Hey, Shiv, what are you hearing?

07:54.477 --> 07:56.478
Rome's at my mom's.

07:56.478 --> 07:59.272
So, I'm on my way to bag him.
I'm looking for unanimity.

07:59.272 --> 08:03.527
Okay. He's at your mom's?
And have you spoken to Lukas?

08:03.944 --> 08:06.030
Am I for the chop?

08:06.030 --> 08:07.822
I'm trying.

08:08.574 --> 08:11.326
Okay. I just got a bad feeling.

08:11.326 --> 08:13.829
He booked me
in for the third hang.

08:13.829 --> 08:15.580
It's excruciating. I'm scared

08:15.580 --> 08:17.123
he's gonna wanna play
online games

08:17.123 --> 08:19.334
and I'll be running into
a wall for hours, you know?

08:19.334 --> 08:21.961
Tom, hey, Tom? Can we
have a real conversation?

08:23.129 --> 08:27.593
Okay, on the Matsson stuff,
I'll do what I can. I'm trying.

08:27.593 --> 08:32.098
But, with us, I wanted
to get a few things straight.

08:32.098 --> 08:35.101
Yeah, I just want it to be really nice.

08:35.101 --> 08:37.602
And we should Czechoslovakia it.

08:37.602 --> 08:41.106
We should make it all lovely,
velvet, parting of the ways.

08:41.106 --> 08:44.693
So, for you,
there's not anything left?

08:45.653 --> 08:47.237
Well, how do you mean?

08:47.904 --> 08:52.368
Well, I wondered if, I guess
I thought it might be worth raising,

08:52.368 --> 08:58.499
are there any positives about
the nightmare we've shared?

08:58.916 --> 09:00.209
As in?

09:00.209 --> 09:03.044
If there was anything there,

09:05.423 --> 09:09.969
if there was,
then it would be so convenient.

09:10.511 --> 09:12.512
Well, it would be
incredibly convenient

09:12.512 --> 09:15.640
because you would be married
to your husband.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.892
Yeah, exactly.

09:17.892 --> 09:21.230
And then you think of the scheduling.
It's mess-free.

09:21.230 --> 09:23.898
Yeah. You've fallen in love, finally.

09:23.898 --> 09:28.153
You've fallen in love
with our scheduling opportunities.

09:30.698 --> 09:35.618
And I would also, you know,
would love to not to have...

09:36.203 --> 09:39.247
You don't like to fail the test,
do you, Siobhan?

09:40.499 --> 09:42.168
Well...

09:44.295 --> 09:48.966
Look, I know that we've said
the worst things,

09:52.219 --> 09:58.391
but I think I've always
just been scared

09:58.391 --> 10:05.440
in relationships of the underneaths.

10:06.275 --> 10:11.196
What's the worst thing a person
thinks? But we know.

10:11.738 --> 10:16.159
But once you've said and done
the worst things, you're kind of free.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.080
Yeah, I guess my question is,

10:23.125 --> 10:27.587
are you interested
in a real relationship?

10:29.006 --> 10:35.970
Honest to God, I don't know.
Shiv, I just don't know.

10:37.889 --> 10:41.268
Okay. Sure. Alright. Bye.

10:45.147 --> 10:48.401
Stewy. Stewy, bro.
Don't hide from me.

10:49.026 --> 10:52.487
I can see you from up here.
Come with me, Stew.

10:52.487 --> 10:53.864
We can win this.

10:57.575 --> 11:03.791
Ken. Roman.
From Greg and Ratfucker Sam

11:04.624 --> 11:06.960
Okay. Now we're talking.

11:18.471 --> 11:20.140
- Hello, darling.
- Hey, Mom.

11:20.807 --> 11:23.018
So, I hear Romy might be there.

11:23.978 --> 11:25.895
Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't make
your get together,

11:25.895 --> 11:27.898
but I need to speak to Roman
very urgently.

11:27.898 --> 11:30.776
No recriminations,
but it's life or death. Is he there?

11:34.195 --> 11:35.655
I can't say.

11:35.655 --> 11:39.368
You can't say?
Well, he needs to come back.

11:39.368 --> 11:41.786
Is he planning to come back
for tomorrow?

11:41.786 --> 11:43.956
That's for you to decide,
all of you.

11:43.956 --> 11:45.582
He's very fragile.

11:47.418 --> 11:50.670
And is Shiv there? Is she coming?

11:50.670 --> 11:52.589
I don't want to get into a lot
of business, alright?

11:52.589 --> 11:54.759
I'd love for the whole family
to be here,

11:54.759 --> 11:56.719
but if it's going to be thumbscrews,

11:56.719 --> 11:58.512
I'd rather it didn't happen
in my house.

11:58.512 --> 12:00.930
Okay. I'm coming.
I'll be there, Mom.

12:04.518 --> 12:07.897
We have him. New Jess,
I'm flying out.

12:07.897 --> 12:10.941
I'll be back tonight. Early tomorrow,
latest, small team.

12:10.941 --> 12:13.152
I'll put this together on the move.

12:13.152 --> 12:16.196
Okay? Let's get him.
Let's bag him and tag him.

12:50.815 --> 12:52.941
- Hey.
- Hey. Welcome.

12:52.941 --> 12:54.819
Shit.
What the fuck happened to you?

12:54.819 --> 12:58.279
- Hello, hello. Hi, lovely.
- Hi.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.910
Wonderful. I see you've brought
you're underling with you.

13:02.910 --> 13:06.664
Yeah, well, got a lot going on.
What the fuck happened?

13:07.288 --> 13:10.125
I just had a discussion with some
of your pals about the merits

13:10.125 --> 13:11.377
of liberal democracy.

13:11.377 --> 13:14.838
Okay, well, it's good
that you're here, I guess.

13:14.838 --> 13:16.381
You can rest and recuperate.

13:16.381 --> 13:18.134
Looks a lot better than he did.

13:18.134 --> 13:20.343
I couldn't look at him
when he first arrived.

13:20.343 --> 13:22.804
That's true.
Peter did my eye drops.

13:22.804 --> 13:25.850
Yeah, bless him.
There's something about eyes.

13:25.850 --> 13:28.352
They just kind of revolt me.

13:28.352 --> 13:31.021
Eyes? Like human eyes we all have?

13:31.021 --> 13:33.606
Yeah, I don't like all these
blobs of jelly rolling around

13:33.606 --> 13:36.277
in your heads. Face eggs.

13:37.945 --> 13:42.198
Anyway, come on in. Place
hasn't changed. Still full of leaks.

13:42.198 --> 13:45.493
I seem to have landed myself
at the only hellhole in paradise.

13:46.287 --> 13:47.579
Pick up, Stewy.

13:50.374 --> 13:52.792
Pick up, pick up, pick up, Stewy.

13:53.336 --> 13:57.714
Stewy, there you are.
Are you with me? Talk to me.

14:00.842 --> 14:03.804
Good man. I knew you wouldn't do me
dirty like that.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.683
I'm just making a pit stop.

14:09.268 --> 14:11.811
I found Roman.
I always had Roman,

14:11.811 --> 14:13.605
but this is just like nailed, nailed.

14:16.649 --> 14:17.985
Okay.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.531
With Lawrence Yee?
Vaulter Lawrence? Okay.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.702
What shape does that make?

14:40.757 --> 14:42.717
Romy!

14:45.178 --> 14:49.433
Where are you? Hello, hello!

14:49.433 --> 14:52.395
The hunt for Red fucking October
is over.

14:53.187 --> 14:54.480
Hey, Portia.

14:57.483 --> 15:00.527
Well, well, well. Look at this
fucking family scene.

15:00.527 --> 15:02.947
Are you okay, man?
What the fuck happened to your face?

15:02.947 --> 15:04.572
Fragile. Yeah, just easy.

15:04.572 --> 15:07.284
- He's fragile?
- Fuck you, fragile. I'm not fragile.

15:07.284 --> 15:10.538
Just back up, yeah?
Just take it easy.

15:10.538 --> 15:11.789
- Back up?
- Yeah.

15:11.789 --> 15:13.791
What? I'm just arriving
for a cup of fucking tea.

15:13.791 --> 15:16.669
You're being very aggressive.
Just calm down.

15:16.669 --> 15:19.922
I'm calm. Can we talk? Okay?

15:19.922 --> 15:21.423
- Oh, God.
- We gotta talk.

15:21.423 --> 15:23.591
Don't talk to me that way.
They're fucked.

15:23.591 --> 15:25.636
You're fucked. We're fucked.
Everyone's fucked

15:25.636 --> 15:27.847
- Don't bullshit me, man.
- What is this?

15:27.847 --> 15:30.015
Did you get your little fucking
screwdriver in on him?

15:30.015 --> 15:31.433
- Did you pry him open?
- No.

15:31.433 --> 15:35.563
Roman, that's bullshit.
We're in this, man.

15:35.563 --> 15:37.606
- What's going on?
- She's doing a number on you, man.

15:37.606 --> 15:39.567
Hey, mom. Yes, hi.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.737
- Are we all right?
- Yeah. I just need to talk to Roman.

15:42.737 --> 15:45.323
- Well, I'm looking after Roman.
- You're not looking after me.

15:45.323 --> 15:47.241
Well, let's be civil, please.

15:48.116 --> 15:49.243
- Rome.
- What?

15:49.243 --> 15:51.536
You promised me. Okay, you
promised me you wouldn't do this.

15:51.536 --> 15:53.789
You promised me you wouldn't
change your mind on this.

15:53.789 --> 15:56.041
Then maybe I did, and I'm sorry.
I don't give a fuck.

15:56.041 --> 16:01.254
This is fucking DEFCON 1, okay?
The world is pivoting on you.

16:01.254 --> 16:04.549
The world is turning
on a fucking clown here.

16:04.549 --> 16:06.302
- Okay, you're a fucking clown.
- Look at you.

16:06.302 --> 16:07.927
Look at you, man.
You're a clown.

16:07.927 --> 16:10.056
Living in a fucking dream world.
You don't have it.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.640
You don't have it. So why are you trying
to, like, fucking get into it?

16:12.640 --> 16:16.854
I have you, I have Paul,
I have Dewi, I have Stewy.

16:16.854 --> 16:19.315
I was in a very violent fight,
which I won, by the way, but I am fine.

16:19.315 --> 16:20.690
Yes, I do.

16:21.232 --> 16:23.402
Just back the fuck off, okay?
Everyone just stop talking.

16:23.402 --> 16:26.071
I'll leave you alone. I'll go.
If you just tell me how you're voting.

16:26.071 --> 16:27.614
That's not backing off.
You're still talking.

16:27.614 --> 16:30.826
- I need you to man up here, Roman.
- I'm going.

16:30.826 --> 16:33.287
- Please don't follow me.
- Don't go fucking hide.

16:35.623 --> 16:37.123
Well, are you staying to dinner,

16:37.123 --> 16:39.126
or are you just in and out
with all the shouting?

16:39.126 --> 16:41.504
I'd love it if it wasn't a horror show.

16:41.504 --> 16:43.839
I can't. There's a huge board meeting.

16:43.839 --> 16:47.133
Huge board meeting?
Gosh, what an event!

16:47.133 --> 16:48.843
That's never happened
before in my life.

16:48.843 --> 16:52.222
I've never had my plans ruined
by a huge board meeting before.

16:52.222 --> 16:55.100
Well, I would love to.
I'm in for dinner.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.395
- Great.
- He might be busy.

16:57.395 --> 17:01.773
You got to call some people, yeah?
He's losing, so he's very busy.

17:02.691 --> 17:04.819
Yeah, that would be nice, mom.
That would be nice.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.697
- I got nowhere to be.
- Great.

17:08.614 --> 17:10.449
- What do you think, man?
- What do I think?

17:11.157 --> 17:15.663
- The colors go well.
- I think this is trippy, dude.

17:15.663 --> 17:17.539
Lukas, second please.

17:19.583 --> 17:23.128
More fucking hanging
than a dictator's birthday.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.840
Hey, the colors go well?
Is that a sentence?

17:25.840 --> 17:29.176
- Does that make sense?
- The colors go well together.

17:29.176 --> 17:31.219
The colors go well.

17:31.219 --> 17:33.680
Greg, you're here for the hang.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.515
So, you know, to jump in

17:35.515 --> 17:39.729
on the little, you know,
those awkward social beats,

17:39.729 --> 17:41.605
you got to be like
fucking social putty.

17:41.605 --> 17:45.316
You're letting me swing.
He's going to fucking fire me.

17:45.316 --> 17:47.445
I need ears and eyes out,
you know,

17:47.445 --> 17:51.489
like on the assistant loop. Ebba.
Like is he planning to kill me?

17:51.489 --> 17:55.953
If he wins, if he gets in,
you are fucked.

17:55.953 --> 17:57.412
You're fucked.

17:58.204 --> 18:00.623
All right, well, he likes me, so...

18:01.792 --> 18:06.880
You? 200K, the highest paid assistant
in human history?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.381
It's new management, bro.

18:08.381 --> 18:11.427
You're going to get busted down
to 20, 30, 40K.

18:11.427 --> 18:12.678
Stop it.

18:12.678 --> 18:16.057
Seriously, and if I get fired,
I think you are fucked.

18:17.223 --> 18:19.727
It's the family death march.

18:27.484 --> 18:29.486
Early bird catches the Rome?

18:29.486 --> 18:31.947
Well, you know, yeah.

18:35.868 --> 18:39.954
Just a couple of things you might be
interested in.

18:41.874 --> 18:43.209
I got Stewy back.

18:43.209 --> 18:48.755
Yeah? Sure. Well, you know,
even if he's telling the truth

18:48.755 --> 18:53.678
and you manage to get Roman,
seven still plays six,

18:53.678 --> 18:55.345
so I'm not sweating it.

18:56.638 --> 19:00.308
Yeah, also, according to my sources,

19:01.185 --> 19:03.436
Matsson is talking to Lawrence Yee.

19:04.063 --> 19:05.438
Vaulter Lawrence?

19:05.438 --> 19:09.442
- Yeah.
- So, you knew that?

19:09.442 --> 19:10.944
Yeah.

19:11.778 --> 19:15.407
Hey, look at this.
Fucking scorpion party.

19:15.407 --> 19:18.119
- Hi.
- All right, who wants a piece of me?

19:18.119 --> 19:21.038
Pay a buck, take a pop
at the human fucking vote.

19:21.038 --> 19:22.289
I'll just cut my arms off.

19:22.289 --> 19:24.249
I can give one to each
of you to take home with,

19:24.249 --> 19:25.875
and then maybe you'll fuck off.

19:26.376 --> 19:27.795
Want some rum punch?

19:30.089 --> 19:34.175
So I was thinking,
and this is just to spitball,

19:34.175 --> 19:37.303
but when this goes
through for you guys,

19:37.303 --> 19:40.140
remember how hot you were
for The Hundred?

19:40.140 --> 19:44.145
You know, could I relinquish
my part of the IP...

19:44.145 --> 19:45.603
That is very thoughtful.

19:45.603 --> 19:48.189
So you'll, like, give us a job
at the mall

19:48.189 --> 19:50.108
and, like, teach us the value
of real money?

19:50.108 --> 19:54.905
Rome, come on, I'm trying
to be realistic

19:54.905 --> 19:58.450
about finding nice shapes here
for when I'm in there.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.993
- That's nice.
- Well, it is nice.

19:59.993 --> 20:04.456
Yeah, actually, I would love
for both of you to support me,

20:04.456 --> 20:05.707
taking over the firm.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.127
What?

20:08.127 --> 20:10.004
Because I'm moving forward,

20:10.004 --> 20:12.923
my kid loses access
to its uncles, yeah?

20:12.923 --> 20:18.137
No, come on, what's it gonna do without
all the sexist and homophobic jokes?

20:18.888 --> 20:21.306
Don't fucking try and play us, Shiv.

20:21.974 --> 20:23.475
Like, stop fucking gloating.

20:23.475 --> 20:25.769
You've got your hands
on my throat, yeah?

20:25.769 --> 20:28.731
So don't be all fucking
Joan of Waystar.

20:28.731 --> 20:31.274
All right, well, I don't know
what to say,

20:31.274 --> 20:34.152
'cause you, you know, you fucking
grabbed the crown, the two of you.

20:34.152 --> 20:38.573
Dad died, and you grabbed
the crown and pushed me out.

20:39.492 --> 20:41.827
So I don't know why I'm the cunt here.

20:42.536 --> 20:44.037
Cunt is as cunt does.

20:45.498 --> 20:49.459
Amazing.
Cicero on the wheels of steel.

20:50.628 --> 20:52.879
And fuck off, okay? I won,

20:53.339 --> 20:56.591
and I'm sorry for winning,
but I did.

20:56.591 --> 20:59.303
Sorry, I'm sorry, and you know what?

20:59.303 --> 21:01.097
I'm actually tired of saying
fucking sorry.

21:01.097 --> 21:02.932
I played it better,

21:03.391 --> 21:06.268
so why don't you take it
like a man and just eat it?

21:08.061 --> 21:10.523
My, what a lovely evening
on the terrace.

21:12.817 --> 21:14.317
How was your sea bass?

21:14.317 --> 21:18.030
Those cod cheeks
were a worthy opponent.

21:18.030 --> 21:19.447
No, it was fine.

21:20.031 --> 21:21.866
Sometimes I feel like every fish
on this city

21:21.866 --> 21:24.911
is the same piece
of Xerox branzino, you know?

21:24.911 --> 21:27.415
Totally, totally. I think we may
have been badly advised.

21:27.415 --> 21:28.832
I think Greg fucked us.

21:30.751 --> 21:32.086
Mersi beaucoup.

21:35.298 --> 21:39.635
How do you feel about self-pitching me?
On Tom.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.178
You know, the main slide.

21:42.805 --> 21:45.891
On me as in my value to keep me?

21:45.891 --> 21:49.436
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, I can sing for my supper.

21:50.270 --> 21:53.898
Well, no, so yeah, as a manager,

21:53.898 --> 21:56.360
I think, you know, I'm simple.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.571
You know, I squeeze the costs
and juice the revenue.

21:59.571 --> 22:01.156
Follow the boss.

22:01.156 --> 22:03.868
I digest strategy and implement.

22:03.868 --> 22:08.414
Like for cruises, for example,
is shit gobbling and firefighting.

22:09.289 --> 22:11.167
Yes, and ATN is money.

22:11.167 --> 22:14.629
You know, I'm cutting heads
and harvesting eyeballs.

22:15.253 --> 22:16.588
It's pretty simple, really.

22:16.588 --> 22:18.799
I give the customer what he wants.
I don't think it's my place

22:18.799 --> 22:20.343
to offer dietary advice.

22:20.343 --> 22:23.553
You know, if they want red meat
and boiling tar, then bon appetito.

22:25.264 --> 22:28.516
And on a hang level,
who would you say you are?

22:28.516 --> 22:30.311
Who am I?

22:31.562 --> 22:33.147
That's a good one.

22:34.314 --> 22:37.860
I'm a grinder.
I grind because I worry.

22:39.945 --> 22:44.909
I worry all night about everything,
all the threats to me

22:44.909 --> 22:47.995
and to my division,
and my physical body,

22:47.995 --> 22:51.040
and I have an excess of vigilance,

22:51.040 --> 22:53.751
I think, and I have
a very high tolerance

22:53.751 --> 22:56.379
for pain and physical discomfort.

22:56.379 --> 22:59.423
Can I be frank with you?
Can you be discreet?

22:59.423 --> 23:00.840
Fuck yeah.

23:01.966 --> 23:08.057
The thing is, with Shiv,
and with the vote coming up and all,

23:08.057 --> 23:11.394
can we keep this thing close to
our chest until I know my numbers?

23:11.394 --> 23:12.894
Sure.

23:12.894 --> 23:17.816
I think it's all fine.
It's just I have this thing with her,

23:17.816 --> 23:19.901
which is like...

23:21.986 --> 23:25.282
Is it a bit too much, you know?

23:25.282 --> 23:28.160
Okay. The cartoon?

23:28.160 --> 23:30.912
No, fuck the cartoon.
That was funny. I enjoyed that.

23:31.789 --> 23:34.290
No, she was kind of pushy
on the India tactics,

23:34.290 --> 23:39.212
and at first I thought family
continuity would be an upside.

23:40.714 --> 23:42.590
She is smart,

23:42.590 --> 23:49.305
but I got plenty of ideas.
I don't know if I need more ideas.

23:49.305 --> 23:51.683
I was in need of a little bit
of the political connection,

23:51.683 --> 23:54.310
but it turns out it's fucking easy.

23:54.310 --> 23:59.733
It really is, and with Ebba and
blah, blah, blah, I know everything.

24:00.693 --> 24:03.863
- You do.
- I do.

24:05.280 --> 24:10.535
Plus, with Shiv, there's also,
you know...

24:14.040 --> 24:15.875
She's somewhat...

24:17.585 --> 24:21.505
We're a bit clickety-clickety,
if you know what I'm saying.

24:22.714 --> 24:24.799
- Right, like?
- A little bit...

24:26.969 --> 24:30.431
I want to fuck her a little bit.

24:31.140 --> 24:36.311
Sorry to get weird, but like
under the right circumstances,

24:39.147 --> 24:40.566
she'd fuck me too.

24:44.569 --> 24:47.156
Is this making you uncomfortable?
I'm sorry if it's weird.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.531
No, no, we're men.

24:48.531 --> 24:52.078
I can't deal with the mess of that,
you know?

24:52.078 --> 24:56.165
So then I was thinking, well, if I can
have fucking anyone in the world,

24:57.123 --> 25:00.043
why don't I get the guy
who put the baby inside her

25:00.043 --> 25:02.087
instead of the baby lady?

25:04.590 --> 25:07.092
- Just...
- Right.

25:08.761 --> 25:12.139
Right.
Well, I could do it.

25:12.139 --> 25:15.518
I could definitely,
easily, definitely do it.

25:15.518 --> 25:18.187
I need an American, because I don't
want to scare the horses,

25:18.187 --> 25:20.523
ATN being the profit center.

25:21.898 --> 25:24.902
Mencken likes you,
if that happens, you know?

25:24.902 --> 25:27.654
You're fucking talented.

25:28.655 --> 25:35.745
So, but also, honestly,
I'm not looking for a partner, you know?

25:36.122 --> 25:38.790
I'm looking for a front man,

25:38.790 --> 25:42.502
because we're going to cut shit
close to the bone.

25:42.502 --> 25:46.172
We're going to get right fucking
in there. It's going to get nasty.

25:47.258 --> 25:54.431
I need a pain sponge when I'm under
the hood doing what I love, you know?

25:55.391 --> 25:57.058
- Sure.
- That's kind of what I'm after.

25:57.058 --> 26:00.604
- So would that be a problem?
- Nah. No, man.

26:00.604 --> 26:04.525
- Nah. I could do it.
- Logan Mark II.

26:04.525 --> 26:06.610
Only this time he's fucking sexy.

26:09.070 --> 26:11.197
- Yeah. Do you want to do some shots?
- Yes.

26:13.617 --> 26:15.118
Let's get a little loose, baby.

26:15.577 --> 26:17.704
- Oskar!
- Yeah.

26:26.631 --> 26:27.881
Tom.

26:31.344 --> 26:32.678
Motherfucker.

26:33.303 --> 26:35.430
- What?
- Motherfucker.

26:35.430 --> 26:38.058
Are you keeping your job?

26:39.185 --> 26:43.188
- Am I?
- We're going to be okay, Greg.

26:44.190 --> 26:47.442
- We're going to be okay.
- Which is it?

26:47.442 --> 26:50.737
You're going to get castrated on pay,

26:50.737 --> 26:54.533
like decimated,
but I think I can keep you.

26:54.867 --> 26:57.703
Okay?
Keep an eye on.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.163
- Piss man, out.
- Okay.

27:02.248 --> 27:03.583
Shit!

27:08.546 --> 27:11.050
- Gregory.
- Have a drink.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.718
We're doing shots.
Yeah, four shots.

27:14.178 --> 27:15.804
Yeah, you can handle some vodka, right?

27:15.804 --> 27:18.015
- Yeah.
- From the motherland.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.894
But that guy in there,
what do you think?

27:21.894 --> 27:24.979
- I think it feels pretty good.
- Do you think it works?

27:24.979 --> 27:28.566
I think he's what I need.
I think it works.

27:29.527 --> 27:34.531
- He's an empty, lovely, spacious...
- How are you going to do it?

27:35.825 --> 27:39.244
- With Shiv, you mean?
- Yeah.

27:39.244 --> 27:42.039
When do you tell her
it won't be her?

27:42.790 --> 27:47.419
Because the lawyer says since
it's about her inheritance,

27:47.419 --> 27:49.963
I think we have room for maneuvering.

27:56.137 --> 28:00.390
It's going to be hearty fare,
but modest rations.

28:00.390 --> 28:02.059
Surprise, surprise!

28:02.059 --> 28:04.645
Well, I knew you wouldn't
be hungry in this heat.

28:05.311 --> 28:08.273
Anyway, we can fill up
on brecky tomorrow,

28:08.273 --> 28:11.944
that horrible place where I think
someone from Pink Floyd did a poo

28:11.944 --> 28:13.194
in the swimming pool.

28:13.194 --> 28:15.238
Yeah, we'll need to be getting back, Mum.

28:15.238 --> 28:17.783
Stop Shiv selling our birthright.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.244
Well, actually, to continue on
with Dad's plans and wishes.

28:21.244 --> 28:23.706
Please, can we just not?

28:23.706 --> 28:26.876
You know, I'm really
happy to have you all here.

28:26.876 --> 28:29.878
I want to say, for what it's worth,

28:29.878 --> 28:32.255
I don't want to stick
my snout in too far.

28:32.255 --> 28:35.760
Maybe I'm wondering whether
this offer from that awful man

28:35.760 --> 28:40.473
isn't a perfect opportunity to,
you know, say farewell,

28:41.140 --> 28:45.102
open a new chapter.
That's always been my view.

28:45.102 --> 28:48.522
Are we going to get
an apology for Italy?

28:48.522 --> 28:52.151
Well, yeah, I mean, in some
ways, in a way,

28:52.151 --> 28:55.488
if she thinks we should sell,
there's continuity.

28:55.488 --> 28:58.699
It's my view, and I'm sorry
if you've been determined

28:58.699 --> 29:01.243
to make something squalid out of it.

29:01.243 --> 29:04.537
Is this a set-up?
Is that what this is, Shiv?

29:07.249 --> 29:10.210
You trying to tie Mummy's
apron strings around Romy's nuts?

29:10.210 --> 29:11.963
- What?
- I'm going to get Peter.

29:11.963 --> 29:15.256
I'm going to get Peter and
his friend, because... Peter?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.008
Coming.

29:17.008 --> 29:20.805
His friend Jonathan, he got a scheme
they want to talk to you about,

29:20.805 --> 29:23.474
and Jonathan's an absolute whiz.

29:23.474 --> 29:26.060
He's just been going through
some shitty stuff recently.

29:26.060 --> 29:29.647
- Hello.
- This is Jonathan.

29:29.647 --> 29:31.898
Is this a fucking pitch?
Is that what this is?

29:31.898 --> 29:34.151
- It might seem inappropriate...
- No, not at all.

29:34.151 --> 29:36.153
No, it might seem inappropriate,
but it's not,

29:36.153 --> 29:39.073
because your mother's been
kind enough to allow me

29:39.073 --> 29:41.825
to get you before the vultures,

29:41.825 --> 29:45.161
because, frankly, the margins
on this thing are just so creamy

29:45.161 --> 29:48.416
that I honestly would
feel like a terrible shit

29:48.416 --> 29:53.462
if I didn't give you
the chance to come to the party.

29:53.462 --> 29:56.172
- That's all.
- This is really interesting.

29:56.172 --> 29:58.551
I can't believe how rude you are!

30:03.347 --> 30:05.141
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Ken.

30:05.141 --> 30:08.601
So I have something huge.

30:08.601 --> 30:11.689
Dude, I'm in the center
of the fucking universe

30:11.689 --> 30:17.485
with, like, knowledge to fucking
like, take down solar systems, man.

30:17.485 --> 30:20.321
Sure, sure, man.
That's great.

30:21.032 --> 30:23.868
Okay, but if I give you
something incredible,

30:23.868 --> 30:26.411
would you give me
something amazing?

30:27.412 --> 30:29.123
Yeah, sure.
Like what?

30:29.582 --> 30:33.209
Well, I'm serious, dude.
It is amazing.

30:33.836 --> 30:36.964
Sure, that's why I'm going
to give you something incredible.

30:36.964 --> 30:38.590
I would need...

30:40.467 --> 30:44.095
Basically, can you guys win,
you and Rome?

30:47.642 --> 30:49.893
And could I quad it up, like,
full quad?

30:49.893 --> 30:52.979
Take your shot, buddy.
Just take your shot. Come on.

30:52.979 --> 30:55.441
Okay. Buckle up.

30:56.316 --> 30:58.611
And we're going to be skating
very close to the wind.

30:58.611 --> 31:02.239
But I'm absolutely confident
that no one can,

31:03.032 --> 31:05.784
well, in layman's terms,
get us on this.

31:11.624 --> 31:13.626
Hey, it's Kendall.
I'm going to ask you a question.

31:14.669 --> 31:17.253
If there's any veracity to it,
don't say anything.

31:17.253 --> 31:18.797
You understand?

31:20.048 --> 31:21.925
Matsson is talking to other people.

31:25.972 --> 31:30.016
The point is,
our facilities won't offer,

31:30.016 --> 31:32.644
all that you dreamt
of in a fantasy care home,

31:32.644 --> 31:37.441
but it will afford what I call
a really solid basic level of care,

31:38.066 --> 31:41.362
not necessarily that
one would like for oneself.

31:42.779 --> 31:46.199
Apologies, Shiv.
I need to speak to you in private.

31:46.199 --> 31:48.785
- Sorry, can I be saved as well?
- Please forgive me.

31:48.785 --> 31:51.913
- Sorry, this is very captivating.
- Sorry, so terrible.

31:51.913 --> 31:53.998
You're going to want to hear this.
It's serious.

31:53.998 --> 31:57.753
- I can't wait to hear more, Peter.
- Mom, I need to...

31:58.296 --> 31:59.880
Jonathan, I'm so glad you came.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.174
The fish will just be gummy
by the time you get back.

32:02.174 --> 32:03.925
- I love gummy fish.
- Gummy fish?

32:03.925 --> 32:06.137
Okay, this is...

32:06.137 --> 32:10.057
You're going to want to call,
you want to confirm,

32:10.057 --> 32:12.310
but I've just had it confirmed.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.811
Lukas is interviewing
for an alternative US CEO.

32:16.022 --> 32:17.439
He's fucking you.

32:18.107 --> 32:21.901
- Bullshit.
- It's confirmed.

32:21.901 --> 32:24.822
It's sourced, a number of contacts.
I'm sorry, Shiv.

32:24.822 --> 32:27.866
Yeah, you're sorry?
Bullshit.

32:28.408 --> 32:31.412
Call whoever.
Like, it checks out.

32:31.412 --> 32:36.334
Lawrence, a bunch of vibe hangs.
Have you noticed a little cooling?

32:36.334 --> 32:38.961
A little bit? I wouldn't call Matsson
so we can figure out...

32:38.961 --> 32:41.047
Already calling.

32:44.717 --> 32:47.553
This fucking desperate shit, yeah?

32:49.347 --> 32:50.598
See this?

32:52.891 --> 32:55.561
Is he not answering?
That's interesting.

32:55.561 --> 32:58.439
- Does he normally?
- No, rarely, actually.

33:00.274 --> 33:02.776
- This is so fucking pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

33:02.776 --> 33:04.987
- You are.
- Okay, fine, yeah.

33:04.987 --> 33:09.574
I guess it would be if it wasn't true.
Like, call Karolina.

33:10.325 --> 33:13.995
They have erased you from the
new deal announcement draft.

33:14.872 --> 33:17.208
It's shitty, Shiv.
It's shitty.

33:19.877 --> 33:22.379
Is this fucking accurate?
Is this a move? Is this real?

33:22.379 --> 33:25.383
No, it's real. Greg, 100%.

33:25.383 --> 33:27.677
Fuck. So then, who instead?

33:27.677 --> 33:32.180
A few faces. Lawrence, Klein,
I don't know who else.

33:32.555 --> 33:34.934
- I'll know soon.
- Man...

33:36.184 --> 33:40.398
Okay.
I mean, with her, things are...

33:41.898 --> 33:43.109
Things are back?

33:44.402 --> 33:46.904
As long as she can recalibrate, yeah.

33:49.615 --> 33:50.699
I think it's game on.

33:51.367 --> 33:52.702
Fucking call me back!

34:13.138 --> 34:16.684
- I think it's just hard for her.
- Yeah, that's very apparent.

34:17.017 --> 34:18.893
That's a real thing.

34:20.770 --> 34:22.148
- Shit.
- Yeah.

34:23.898 --> 34:27.403
So we just...
I think we just lay it out for her.

34:28.862 --> 34:30.155
Yeah.

34:31.741 --> 34:33.659
- Hey.
- So?

34:34.869 --> 34:37.954
- What do we do?
- Well, did you talk to him, Lukas?

34:37.954 --> 34:40.124
No.
I don't want to talk to Lukas.

34:40.124 --> 34:42.876
No, I don't want to.
But I don't...

34:43.294 --> 34:45.671
- Don't fucking look at me!
- What?

34:45.671 --> 34:47.339
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- No you're not!

34:47.339 --> 34:49.050
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, what can I say?

34:49.050 --> 34:52.887
Maybe nothing.
You might get someone.

34:52.887 --> 34:56.389
- You might get Laird or Telus...
- No, not fucking Laird.

34:56.389 --> 34:59.351
Not Telus.
Fucking, I hate Telus.

34:59.351 --> 35:01.102
I detest Telus.
He's the worst.

35:02.228 --> 35:03.938
He is the worst.

35:06.066 --> 35:08.943
Call Telus.
We obviously need to read.

35:08.943 --> 35:12.990
Call Telus. But he's not getting
even a tiny piece of this. Yeah?

35:12.990 --> 35:16.451
- You okay to do this?
- This is ugly and this is bad.

35:16.451 --> 35:18.412
- It doesn't feel great.
- I know.

35:18.412 --> 35:20.581
But we're a powerful block.

35:20.581 --> 35:23.125
It was sloppy.
It was careless.

35:24.084 --> 35:25.585
We're ready to fucking kill him.

35:25.585 --> 35:27.546
Yeah, I mean, I think
you're chasing rainbows.

35:27.546 --> 35:30.758
To be honest, I think he has
this all sewn up, but sure.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.178
- Ahoy, ahoy, you there?
- Telly.

35:36.137 --> 35:38.015
- Hey.
- Telly, you got my message?

35:38.015 --> 35:39.349
I just saw it.

35:39.349 --> 35:44.105
So look, this is non-prejudicial.
This is friend-level briefing.

35:44.105 --> 35:46.190
Clean of upside,
downside, or legal action.

35:46.190 --> 35:49.986
Side effects may include
a fat fucking consultation fee.

35:49.986 --> 35:53.197
So, yeah, this makes sense
about US CEO?

35:53.197 --> 35:55.074
- Him changing lanes?
- Yeah.

35:55.074 --> 35:57.743
I mean, from his point of view,
he doesn't need the name.

35:57.743 --> 35:58.993
He needs chops.

35:58.993 --> 36:00.329
- And Shiv doesn't have...
- Shiv's here.

36:00.329 --> 36:03.040
- Fuck you, Telus.
- Sorry, Shiv.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.711
No, I just mean in terms of the
names, which are being discussed,

36:06.711 --> 36:08.212
they make...

36:08.212 --> 36:09.714
Cut to the chase, blondie.

36:09.714 --> 36:13.968
Okay, if it's you three as a voting
block, and on top you have, say...

36:13.968 --> 36:18.304
I have Ewan, I have Paul,
I have Dewi, I think.

36:18.304 --> 36:20.766
And then Stewy, pretty sure.

36:20.766 --> 36:23.728
I mean, as a voting bloc,
you can probably threaten to kill it.

36:23.728 --> 36:25.687
So, yeah, you have the whip hand.

36:25.687 --> 36:27.731
What about leadership? Yeah?

36:27.731 --> 36:31.235
Yeah. You need to present a coherent
plan to the board,

36:31.235 --> 36:33.069
including your leadership candidate.

36:33.069 --> 36:39.577
And a combination, or like a trio,
a troika, would that work?

36:40.702 --> 36:44.456
- Well...
- Just fucking say it, man.

36:44.456 --> 36:45.791
Just say.

36:45.791 --> 36:49.044
I think it hasn't been great
for credibility.

36:49.044 --> 36:51.129
The incredible fuck-brother bandwagon.

36:51.129 --> 36:54.299
Well, who the hell calls us the
incredible fuck-brother bandwagon?

36:54.299 --> 36:56.218
- Everyone.
- Really?

36:56.218 --> 37:01.056
You need to look like a united
front with a coherent plan.

37:01.056 --> 37:03.434
That's not a cop-out
at the fudge factory.

37:03.434 --> 37:06.311
One strong name for CEO, either
combined with a chair,

37:06.311 --> 37:10.858
or a chair with business chops,
is what I would say. Off the record.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.652
Thanks, Telly. Okay, we might be
in touch on some moves here, man.

37:14.652 --> 37:15.695
Sounds good.

37:19.783 --> 37:22.077
I think there's a few ways
through this.

37:22.077 --> 37:25.414
Call Laird. Call anyone.
Honestly, anyone.

37:25.414 --> 37:28.625
Anyone would say we have to go
into battle with our own version

37:28.625 --> 37:31.087
of the future with a king.

37:31.087 --> 37:34.381
And pray tell,
do you have one in mind?

37:34.381 --> 37:36.091
Matsson's a fucking prick. Right?

37:36.091 --> 37:38.803
He practically killed Dad,
dragging him over.

37:38.803 --> 37:41.639
He's capricious, he's cold,
he doesn't understand the business.

37:41.639 --> 37:44.600
- He's a prick.
- I would like to kill him.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.060
And if we're gonna kill him,
we need to get real.

37:48.270 --> 37:49.646
And we would need...

37:52.024 --> 37:54.317
I think it would be me, right?

37:56.486 --> 38:01.242
Well, Dad said that it would be me.

38:02.868 --> 38:04.370
When?

38:05.371 --> 38:10.375
Well, we were getting close again
before, and you know this, mostly.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.086
And I was texting,
and he was warm,

38:13.086 --> 38:18.634
and he said when I was with him
late one night that it should be.

38:18.634 --> 38:20.177
Persuasive.

38:21.137 --> 38:24.014
What else did he say
when no one was around?

38:24.014 --> 38:27.393
That he was the Zodiac Killer?
That he did Tupac?

38:27.393 --> 38:30.895
Whatever. I've said it, it's true,
and yeah, fuck it.

38:30.895 --> 38:32.981
Do whatever you want with that.
It's just the fucking truth.

38:32.981 --> 38:34.858
- Well, he offered it to me too, Rom.
- Yeah?

38:35.609 --> 38:40.323
He fucking promised it to me. Promised.

38:41.114 --> 38:42.699
When I was seven.

38:42.699 --> 38:44.702
He sat me down
at the candy kitchen

38:44.702 --> 38:47.788
in Bridgehampton,
and he fucking promised it to me.

38:49.039 --> 38:52.918
Seven years old.
Like, can you imagine?

38:52.918 --> 38:56.172
Yeah. Picks, or it didn't happen.

38:57.214 --> 39:01.844
That was messed up.
Like, he shouldn't have done that.

39:01.844 --> 39:04.262
No. He shouldn't have said that.

39:04.262 --> 39:08.559
I'm simply saying he said a lot of
things, and he said them to me first.

39:08.559 --> 39:10.686
Yeah, and he said it to me last.

39:11.812 --> 39:13.314
Do you even want it?

39:14.647 --> 39:17.443
Because, at the funeral...

39:17.443 --> 39:21.321
- You're not that guy. You're not...
- What?

39:21.321 --> 39:26.076
You couldn't do the rounds,
you kind of shrank into yourself.

39:26.076 --> 39:30.498
Why? Because I fucking cried
a little at my father's funeral?

39:30.498 --> 39:33.584
That means I'm totally fucked forever?
That doesn't seem right.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.753
It absolutely does not
make you a bad person.

39:35.753 --> 39:37.713
Like, maybe it makes you
a good person,

39:37.713 --> 39:39.172
that you weren't snaking at the funeral.

39:39.172 --> 39:42.217
Maybe you're well-adjusted,
and I'm a business psycho.

39:42.217 --> 39:46.722
I don't know, man. It's a fucking
horrible job that clearly kills you,

39:46.722 --> 39:50.475
so I'm just, honestly, trying
to guide us through the years

39:50.475 --> 39:52.018
to some truth here, man.

39:52.018 --> 39:54.312
- Cheesy.
- I'm serious.

39:54.312 --> 39:57.273
Serious fucking cheese balls,
what you are.

40:04.155 --> 40:08.284
He just can't say it. He doesn't
want it, but he can't say it.

40:08.785 --> 40:10.286
And me?

40:10.286 --> 40:12.248
I love you, Shiv. I fucking love you,

40:12.248 --> 40:16.919
but we simply cannot walk in there
and say we're blocking his offer,

40:16.919 --> 40:20.296
and we have this compelling vision,
and say that leading it is you

40:20.296 --> 40:23.508
when yesterday you were singing
his song. We simply can't.

40:23.508 --> 40:24.926
And we can't say it's Roman,

40:24.926 --> 40:27.679
because he lacks heft
and he looks pathetic,

40:27.679 --> 40:29.307
and he might flop.

40:29.307 --> 40:33.226
So obviously, I want it to be me,

40:33.686 --> 40:36.689
but I genuinely think anyone would say,

40:36.689 --> 40:42.320
anyone objectively would say,
"LA, my profile, experience, position,"

40:42.320 --> 40:45.405
"desire, public pronouncements",
it's me.

40:46.657 --> 40:48.408
If we want to hold on to this company,

40:48.408 --> 40:52.955
for us, for my kids,
for yours, it's me.

40:57.876 --> 40:59.754
- Hey, Rome.
- Yeah?

41:01.255 --> 41:05.050
Guess who Kendall thinks it should be.
It's gonna blow your fucking mind.

41:07.928 --> 41:10.640
We can find a cool structure, right?

41:10.640 --> 41:12.725
Like fiefdoms, kingdoms.

41:14.143 --> 41:18.146
We pull off a reverse viking,
guys. It's fucking huge.

41:18.146 --> 41:21.984
Shit, seriously, take ATN,
take all of news, save the world.

41:22.443 --> 41:26.113
Rome, social media,
fuck it all up again. It'll be fun.

41:33.828 --> 41:36.666
Not actually going in, right?
Because, you know...

41:38.125 --> 41:40.920
There's no bad sharks in Bim,
baby. They're North Atlantic.

41:40.920 --> 41:44.089
They can commute. All the seas,
in case you didn't know this,

41:44.089 --> 41:48.511
are connected. It's like a huge water
subway for things that want to eat me.

41:48.511 --> 41:50.553
Come on. Let's do it.

41:55.351 --> 41:57.979
- Did he?
- Yeah.

41:58.521 --> 42:00.648
Can you give us a minute?

42:02.775 --> 42:04.360
Thank you.

42:11.282 --> 42:12.493
So?

42:13.119 --> 42:16.996
We could fuck it. Get out.
Sell it to Matsson,

42:16.996 --> 42:20.250
let Lawrence

42:20.250 --> 42:25.505
or some other business school
dry cleaner shit on the throne.

42:25.505 --> 42:27.424
Set up shop,
and give away the keys?

42:28.134 --> 42:32.178
Can't be him, though.
But it really can't be you.

42:32.930 --> 42:35.890
Well, okay, I hate him.
But I fear you.

42:36.600 --> 42:41.438
He would be unbearable,
and you would be a disaster.

42:42.105 --> 42:43.316
He'd be...

42:44.232 --> 42:46.527
It will be terrible, it will.

42:46.986 --> 42:50.864
But, I don't know, I can sort
of unfortunately, see it.

42:51.741 --> 42:53.326
Where's you?

42:53.326 --> 42:54.993
Matsson took me seriously.

42:54.993 --> 42:58.788
Or he played you like a big fiddle.
Like a pregnant cello.

43:00.373 --> 43:02.168
Sorry.

43:14.429 --> 43:16.849
Who do you think Dad
actually wanted to give it to?

43:18.351 --> 43:21.312
I don't think Dad gave a fuck about
anything more

43:21.312 --> 43:23.439
than putting one foot in front
of the other.

43:24.023 --> 43:26.441
Yeah, I don't think he wanted
to give it to any of us.

43:26.441 --> 43:30.445
I don't know.
We could give it to him.

43:31.906 --> 43:33.782
Yeah. Probably should.

43:36.535 --> 43:39.580
Unless we kill him.

43:39.580 --> 43:43.666
Okay. Kill him? I like that.
That's intriguing. How'd we do it?

43:43.666 --> 43:48.506
Well, just a bit of horseplay
gone wrong. Just a biff to the head

43:48.506 --> 43:51.341
and a bonk on the noggin
with a coconut.

43:51.341 --> 43:53.803
Wait 'til he goes limp,
goes around, comes around?

43:53.803 --> 43:58.057
Yeah, and if we kill him,
we get to go to bed. I'm tired.

43:58.057 --> 44:00.059
It'd be so annoying if it went wrong.

44:00.059 --> 44:01.978
The murdering. Like...

44:02.603 --> 44:05.063
"Did you just tried to murder me?"

44:05.856 --> 44:10.903
"Dude, that is so not actually
what you're meant to do."

44:10.903 --> 44:12.947
"And is not a good thing to do."

44:12.947 --> 44:17.743
"You guys actually just murdered me.
You guys are the worst. How dare you?"

44:24.083 --> 44:25.584
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

44:27.377 --> 44:28.796
- Hi.
- Hey.

44:29.504 --> 44:32.466
So, we were thinking
of murdering you.

44:32.466 --> 44:33.717
Don't tell him.

44:33.717 --> 44:38.097
But, you know, it's too much prep.

44:38.097 --> 44:41.474
- Too much murder admin.
- No stomach for the admin.

44:43.101 --> 44:44.602
So...

44:46.646 --> 44:48.899
We anoint you.

44:50.192 --> 44:52.695
You get the bauble.
Congratulations!

44:53.279 --> 44:56.782
It's haunted and cursed
and nothing will ever go right,

44:56.782 --> 44:58.868
but enjoy your bauble.

44:58.868 --> 45:01.120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:02.746 --> 45:04.330
Thank you.

45:05.957 --> 45:10.545
His face...
You can smile, bitch.

45:11.339 --> 45:13.798
- Yeah, there we go.
- There you go.

45:13.798 --> 45:16.384
- Show us those goddamn teeth.
- Happy Ken.

45:16.384 --> 45:18.304
Happy Ken. Weird.

45:18.304 --> 45:20.472
That's what Happy Kendall looks like.

45:21.766 --> 45:24.560
If we're going to anoint him,
he needs to complete a task.

45:25.310 --> 45:28.980
Like walk upstairs
and say real quietly,

45:28.980 --> 45:32.318
"Hey Jonathan, I'd like a word
with you in my ass."

45:32.860 --> 45:35.488
And say with a spoonful
of cinnamon in your mouth.

45:35.488 --> 45:36.821
That's been done.

45:36.821 --> 45:39.824
That's what they made Lee Iacocca
do when he took over at Ford.

45:39.824 --> 45:41.118
- Rome.
- What?

45:41.118 --> 45:42.535
Meal fit for a king?

45:43.829 --> 45:48.876
Yes. We are going to make
you a meal fit for a king, sir.

45:48.876 --> 45:51.504
- Yes, sir.
- What a mighty bounty.

45:51.504 --> 45:53.963
Is there actually anything in
there for a sandwich? I'm starving.

45:53.963 --> 45:58.761
Yes. Mummy with pair
of sprouting potatoes,

45:58.761 --> 46:01.721
zero percent milk,
and wartime pickle.

46:01.721 --> 46:05.643
You do spoil us so.
Something gross.

46:05.643 --> 46:08.771
You're going to be a great CEO.
I really think that.

46:08.771 --> 46:11.064
If this doesn't kill you,
which it definitely will.

46:11.064 --> 46:14.192
Well, I'm actually starving,
and I think this is expired.

46:14.192 --> 46:17.029
- This is a hot sauce.
- Milk?

46:17.029 --> 46:18.614
- Milk.
- It's a great starter.

46:18.614 --> 46:23.452
Meal fit for a king.

46:23.452 --> 46:26.746
- Meal fit for a king.
- Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

46:26.746 --> 46:30.500
You all came back.
What's going on?

46:30.500 --> 46:34.964
Hi.
We're making a meal fit for a king.

46:34.964 --> 46:36.631
- Yeah?
- I'm the king.

46:36.631 --> 46:37.841
Can you do it quietly,

46:37.841 --> 46:40.427
because, you know, Jonathan's trying
to get to sleep upstairs?

46:40.427 --> 46:42.680
He's trying to recover
after your rudeness.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.183
He came all the way from Monaco.
He has to watch his days here.

46:47.183 --> 46:50.021
- We're celebrating.
- We're not celebrating.

46:50.021 --> 46:52.731
We're mourning.
We're trying to kill him.

46:52.731 --> 46:56.193
We're voting as a bloc,
together, to keep the firm.

46:56.193 --> 46:59.488
Blimey O'Reilly.
Oh, gosh!

47:00.238 --> 47:03.199
Well, on your head be it.

47:03.199 --> 47:07.121
Well, I had some negative news,
and so then we decided

47:07.121 --> 47:10.040
to have a friendly conversation
about who it would be.

47:10.040 --> 47:13.126
Now we have to anoint him,
because that's what you do to a king.

47:13.126 --> 47:16.130
Fine.
That fucks Christmas up, doesn't it?

47:16.130 --> 47:19.466
Don't touch that.
That's Peter's cheese.

47:19.466 --> 47:22.386
For God's sake!
I made that mistake myself.

47:22.386 --> 47:25.514
His special cheese,
he gets really boring about it.

47:25.514 --> 47:27.724
Mother, there really isn't much food.

47:27.724 --> 47:30.810
I'll tell you what. Peter doesn't like
the knobbies, so I freeze them.

47:30.810 --> 47:32.146
He doesn't like the what?

47:32.146 --> 47:34.647
The knobbies, the loaf ends.

47:34.647 --> 47:36.817
- Okay.
- Enjoy.

47:36.817 --> 47:40.320
- It's a bag of frozen knobbies.
- Be inventive.

47:40.779 --> 47:44.574
I'm actually quite glad
that you're getting along so well.

47:44.991 --> 47:48.996
I mean, Peter will be disappointed,
but, you know, it's nice to see

47:48.996 --> 47:52.958
you've got something to agree about,
besides what a terrible mother I am.

47:53.875 --> 47:56.712
Well, we'll never disagree
on that one.

47:57.379 --> 47:58.714
I'm sure. Nighty-night.

47:58.714 --> 48:00.383
- We love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.

48:00.383 --> 48:02.092
- Love you, Mama.
- Night-night.

48:04.011 --> 48:05.471
I'm gonna eat his cheese.

48:05.471 --> 48:09.141
Peter doesn't like the knobbies, darling.

48:09.141 --> 48:10.600
You're a knobby.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.854
You're a knobby! Catch it!
You're a knobby.

48:13.854 --> 48:16.231
Bring it around.
How do we do that?

48:16.231 --> 48:20.569
- Don't eat his cheese.
- Jonathan's sleeping.

48:21.654 --> 48:25.198
- Sorry, Peter.
- Don't do that.

48:25.198 --> 48:29.453
Oh, my God!
That is so gross!

48:30.370 --> 48:31.955
I'm so sorry, Mommy.

48:31.955 --> 48:35.751
Don't go down on
Peter's special cheese!

48:38.337 --> 48:41.256
I'm so sorry, Mommy.
I licked it all over.

48:41.256 --> 48:43.759
I'm so sorry, Mommy.
I licked your cheese.

48:43.759 --> 48:47.221
I can't stop licking his cheese.
I'm so sorry.

48:47.888 --> 48:51.266
A little Tabasco.
A lot of Tabasco.

48:51.766 --> 48:54.894
Now, this is really...
We're so close.

48:55.521 --> 48:58.232
Rinse... Yeah!

48:58.232 --> 49:00.650
Can I add some pickle?
You love that.

49:01.444 --> 49:03.695
So close.
Never got there.

49:05.155 --> 49:08.450
Yeah, we're good.
I think this is good.

49:09.618 --> 49:14.247
No, this is a healthful tonic.
This is really good.

49:17.375 --> 49:19.419
A meal fit for a king!

49:20.920 --> 49:23.923
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm not actually drinking that.

49:23.923 --> 49:26.176
Meal fit for a king!

49:26.176 --> 49:28.346
No, no, no.

49:29.846 --> 49:31.182
Drink up!

49:32.683 --> 49:37.020
This is going to be all right, right?
Like, we're all right?

49:37.980 --> 49:40.566
- Yeah?
- Just fucking drink it.

49:42.901 --> 49:44.486
Oh, God!

49:46.197 --> 49:48.366
Oh, my God.

49:48.366 --> 49:51.242
Kings don't wear silly hats!
Kings wear crowns.

49:51.242 --> 49:52.453
I can't drink anymore.

49:52.453 --> 49:54.746
Well, then don't. Wear your crown, sir.

49:54.746 --> 49:57.415
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Wear your crown.

49:57.415 --> 50:00.378
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God.

50:00.378 --> 50:02.003
- Mom!
- King!

50:03.088 --> 50:04.548
Goodbye, darling.

50:12.097 --> 50:13.432
Bye.

50:17.686 --> 50:19.229
Go away!

50:19.938 --> 50:22.191
Don't fucking waste your time!

50:35.995 --> 50:38.833
I think Ewan is best just left to it.

50:38.833 --> 50:41.292
I don't know.
I don't know if there's time, Con.

50:48.425 --> 50:50.761
Paul's good.
He doesn't trust tech.

50:51.219 --> 50:54.598
Con wants to know if we're
going to make the Great Reallocation.

50:54.598 --> 50:56.475
I mean, do we care?
Do we want to?

50:56.475 --> 50:58.728
Are Frank and Karl going to be there?

50:58.728 --> 51:02.522
- I don't know.
- I mean, should we just do?

51:02.522 --> 51:04.942
- We're gonna hide out at dad's.
- He's kind of losing his shit.

51:04.942 --> 51:06.902
Let's do it.
To the Great Reallocation.

51:06.902 --> 51:11.406
Okay, off we go.
To the fucking antique shit show.

51:13.992 --> 51:16.536
How are you?
To my dad's.

51:26.213 --> 51:30.216
I know that many of you have
somewhere rather important to be,

51:30.216 --> 51:32.802
but the system is pretty simple.

51:32.802 --> 51:36.473
So as you move in a clockwise direction
around the apartment,

51:36.473 --> 51:39.601
affix your stickers to objects
you covet.

51:39.601 --> 51:42.270
One sticker each on a number
of different articles

51:42.270 --> 51:45.608
or many on one prized item.

51:45.608 --> 51:50.321
Okay, so subsequent circulating
mourners will then apply their stickers.

51:50.321 --> 51:53.073
After two stickering,
perambulating circuits...

51:53.073 --> 51:54.783
We call them SBCs.

51:54.783 --> 51:57.662
Objects will be assigned
to the higher sticker bidder.

51:57.662 --> 52:00.372
Where sticker claims are tied,

52:00.372 --> 52:03.709
we move on to the tie break
stickering perambulating circuit.

52:03.709 --> 52:05.210
TBSBCs.

52:05.210 --> 52:08.755
After which, all unstickered items
will be pooled

52:08.755 --> 52:11.008
and distributed
in reverse alphabetical order

52:11.008 --> 52:16.012
other than those stickered by the
second tier, excuse me, bereaved.

52:16.012 --> 52:18.307
- Do I make myself clear?
- Absolutely.

52:18.307 --> 52:21.102
- It's a good system, Con.
- All right, it's on. Go get them.

52:22.310 --> 52:23.853
That's nice.

52:23.853 --> 52:25.314
Con, where are the medals?

52:27.775 --> 52:33.405
Yeah, there was a first round,
there was an initial round.

52:33.405 --> 52:35.782
And who was present at that?

52:38.285 --> 52:40.995
That was myself.

52:42.373 --> 52:45.709
Okay.
And does all of this have to go?

52:45.709 --> 52:46.876
I mean, you don't want to...

52:46.876 --> 52:49.379
Well, I'd like to get rid
of pretty much everything.

52:49.379 --> 52:51.548
I have some pretty cool stuff
coming in.

52:51.548 --> 52:54.718
Like a cow print couch about yay long.

52:54.718 --> 52:56.095
Great.

52:56.095 --> 52:58.304
Con, you don't want
to keep more for...

52:58.304 --> 53:01.809
What we're planning on,
when Mencken comes through,

53:02.517 --> 53:05.186
we're actually experimenting
with an idea.

53:05.186 --> 53:08.983
I have a play reading in six to eight
months and Con is going to Slovenia

53:08.983 --> 53:12.194
and I'll be working on that.
So we're going to try...

53:12.194 --> 53:17.532
We're really excited how this long
distance thing can add

53:17.532 --> 53:18.826
another dimension.

53:18.826 --> 53:22.538
Add a little spice,
as we get deeper into the marriage.

53:22.538 --> 53:26.292
Yeah, that's sexy. They called it
the second week itch, I believe.

53:26.292 --> 53:27.668
- Rome.
- Yeah.

53:27.668 --> 53:28.960
We're excited.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.796
Heard the latest about
the Wisconsin court thing?

53:31.796 --> 53:33.424
I'm sorry, what court thing?

53:33.424 --> 53:35.509
It's a hiccup.

53:35.509 --> 53:37.637
Just a little hiccup
for Jeryd, I think.

53:38.304 --> 53:42.933
Yeah. Mencken might not make it

53:42.933 --> 53:46.437
and so maybe you might
get to keep him all to yourself.

53:47.146 --> 53:49.607
I think I'm going to take
this letter opener.

53:51.983 --> 53:54.820
- What the fuck is this?
- Virtual dinner with Pop.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.906
What? When is this from?

53:56.906 --> 53:59.075
I don't know how many weeks ago.

53:59.075 --> 54:00.701
Here we go.

54:00.701 --> 54:03.036
Gore, Dole, Bush, Mike D.

54:03.036 --> 54:04.705
Wait, the losers list?

54:04.705 --> 54:09.834
Mondale, Carter, Ford,
not a Lincoln for me.

54:11.087 --> 54:14.715
Hippie George, Humphrey,
St. Barry,

54:15.758 --> 54:19.177
Dick the Bad, Willkie,
Landon Hoover,

54:19.177 --> 54:23.890
Al Smith of the Vatican,
David Cox, Hughes Taft,

54:23.890 --> 54:30.940
Bryan, Martin Van Buren, White Old,
Tippecanoe Clay, hey, JQA!

54:30.940 --> 54:35.235
How many elections
have you lost today?

54:36.361 --> 54:40.825
Clinton the first, but not the worst.

54:41.533 --> 54:47.456
Pick thee twice, Jefferson,
Adams, all very nice.

54:49.583 --> 54:51.794
I can't believe he'd still do that...

54:53.296 --> 54:56.256
Do the limerick.
Gerri, do the limerick.

54:56.256 --> 55:01.428
Much dearer to me than my treasure,
the heiress declared, is my leisure.

55:01.428 --> 55:04.014
For then I can screw
the whole Harvard crew.

55:04.014 --> 55:06.726
They're slow,
but that lengthens the pleasure.

55:08.101 --> 55:09.979
Okay.

55:09.979 --> 55:13.231
I give you, ladies and gentlemen,
"I am a little teapot".

55:13.231 --> 55:16.152
In the manner of Mr. Logan Roy.

55:19.654 --> 55:21.656
- I am a little teapot.
- Fuck off!

55:23.075 --> 55:25.952
- Short and stout.
- What did you fucking call me?

55:26.453 --> 55:28.831
Here's my handle.
Here's my fucking spout.

55:28.831 --> 55:31.499
When I get steamed up,
you can hear me shout.

55:31.499 --> 55:34.337
Frank Vernon is a moron.
Karl Muller is a kraut.

55:35.963 --> 55:37.422
Pop did not like it.

55:41.302 --> 55:43.553
Karl, come on! Sing it!

55:44.930 --> 55:47.349
I want a copy of this.
Sing it!

55:47.349 --> 55:50.769
- There's nought but care...
- I'd like to have it.

55:50.769 --> 55:51.978
I got it.

55:51.978 --> 55:55.148
In every hour that passes, oh,

55:56.191 --> 56:02.781
What signifies the life o' man,
An 'twere na for the lassies, O?

56:02.781 --> 56:04.866
You're murdering it, Karl.

56:06.951 --> 56:10.039
Green grow the rashes, O!

56:10.039 --> 56:13.459
The sweetest hours that e'er I spend...

56:15.835 --> 56:18.463
Kerry, listen. He's murdering it.

56:18.463 --> 56:25.387
The war'ly race may riches chase,
An' riches still may fly them, O.

56:26.555 --> 56:33.687
An' tho' at last they catch them fast,
Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O.

56:34.981 --> 56:41.403
Green grow the rashes, O,
Green grow the rashes, O,

56:41.403 --> 56:48.702
The sweetest hours that e'er I spend,
Are spent amang the lasses, O.

57:02.508 --> 57:05.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:09.307 --> 57:12.642
Doing okay?
You're not going to get canned?

57:13.644 --> 57:18.523
I don't think so, but good luck.

57:19.692 --> 57:21.444
Oh, no.

57:22.193 --> 57:25.321
No, no.
No, that's all fucked.

57:27.074 --> 57:28.534
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:29.243 --> 57:33.580
Yeah, I mean, Matsson
was just stringing me along

57:33.580 --> 57:35.206
or he switched lanes,

57:36.082 --> 57:39.419
but, you know, either way,
it's not going to be me.

57:43.089 --> 57:44.759
Okay. Are you sure?

57:44.759 --> 57:49.513
- Is that even true?
- Yeah.

57:49.513 --> 57:51.015
Yeah, Greg.

57:58.063 --> 58:00.358
Man. Oh man!
What a thing!

58:01.107 --> 58:03.777
That's terrible.

58:03.777 --> 58:07.198
So, who do you think he would,
I mean, who would it be?

58:08.741 --> 58:14.162
I don't know, like a tech pal,
big hitter, Lawrence, maybe.

58:14.622 --> 58:16.123
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

58:17.124 --> 58:18.416
Well, fuck him.

58:19.459 --> 58:22.629
Yeah.
Maybe you should vote it through

58:22.629 --> 58:25.549
if it's all set. I don't know.

58:25.549 --> 58:27.258
- What?
- No, no.

58:27.258 --> 58:30.763
I was just thinking if it was...
No, no.

58:39.981 --> 58:41.940
Shiv, you should probably know.

58:44.526 --> 58:45.861
It's me.

58:48.322 --> 58:49.656
It's you?

58:50.366 --> 58:52.409
Yeah, you might as well know.

58:52.409 --> 58:55.328
- Bullshit.
- You're gonna find out.

58:55.328 --> 58:59.582
It's gonna be, I think, yeah...

58:59.582 --> 59:02.627
And maybe I wonder

59:02.627 --> 59:04.921
if it is an idea that you should...

59:04.921 --> 59:07.591
Fuck you. Really?

59:07.591 --> 59:10.928
Fuck you! What?

59:12.847 --> 59:17.851
Jesus, you're a fucking...
You went for an empty fucking suit?

59:19.436 --> 59:23.232
Maybe you should vote it through.
Yeah, maybe.

59:23.232 --> 59:25.484
Come on. I know you.

59:26.027 --> 59:29.155
Like you wouldn't
if it was the other way around.

59:30.114 --> 59:33.868
You know what? Good luck.
Good luck, motherfucker.

59:34.744 --> 59:36.536
'Cause we have the numbers.
Yeah?

59:36.536 --> 59:38.747
Good fucking luck!

59:46.588 --> 59:48.548
- It's Tom.
- What?

59:48.548 --> 59:50.468
- It's fucking Tom.
- Tom?

59:51.176 --> 59:53.345
Yeah, let's go.
Let's fucking go.

59:53.345 --> 59:55.472
Let's run our numbers.
Let's go.

59:55.472 --> 59:57.224
Fucked by the dry cleaner.

59:57.850 --> 01:00:00.143
Hey, Greg.
Can I have a word?

01:00:00.685 --> 01:00:04.023
A word?
Yeah, just right now. You mind?

01:00:04.023 --> 01:00:06.108
- Corporate matter, tactical.
- Hi, Tom.

01:00:06.108 --> 01:00:07.359
See you.

01:00:08.401 --> 01:00:09.820
Yeah, just in here.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.491
- In the bathroom?
- Sure. Come on.

01:00:16.368 --> 01:00:18.663
- Did you tell?
- What?

01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:22.667
Did you fucking tell?
You bastard!

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:24.418
I was this close,

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:27.128
and now they have a chance to fucking
pull their fucking opposition together,

01:00:27.128 --> 01:00:28.464
you fucking prick.

01:00:28.464 --> 01:00:31.925
- No, I don't think...
- You fucking prick!

01:00:33.009 --> 01:00:37.431
You fucking little piece of shit!

01:01:00.578 --> 01:01:02.331
Problem.
Big fucking problem.

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:06.961
All right, wake up zombies.
Time to activate. Come on.

01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:09.755
Phones!
I want to see some fucking phones!

01:01:10.422 --> 01:01:12.549
And where's Frank?
We get a hold of Frank?

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:15.051
Call Frank!
Make sure he's locked in.

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.679
Okay.
Where's Ebba? Ebba!

01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:19.098
I'm here!

01:01:47.042 --> 01:01:49.044
- Stewy?
- Yeah, wobble.

01:01:49.044 --> 01:01:50.880
He's a wobbly fucking bastard.

01:01:52.172 --> 01:01:54.215
Well, let's go get him.
Let's fuck him up.

01:01:59.096 --> 01:02:00.930
Silence in the courtyard.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:02.515
Silence in the street.

01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:06.103
The biggest fool in England
is just about to speak.

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:08.772
I'm gonna go to my office.

01:02:14.652 --> 01:02:17.614
Hey. How you doing?

01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:20.867
You'll be able to block, you think?

01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:24.372
Great. I think that's great.

01:02:25.247 --> 01:02:29.668
A chance to change the culture.
Backstabbing a new era.

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:33.673
And I was wondering,
just between us,

01:02:33.673 --> 01:02:35.800
and before, you know,
things blow up,

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.135
maybe part of that change
is getting rid of Hugo.

01:02:40.095 --> 01:02:43.140
Just wanted to plant the seed.
That's all.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.684
Well...

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.728
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02:47.728 --> 01:02:49.604
- Morning, morning!
- Congrats.

01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:51.106
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:57.404 --> 01:03:00.116
Well, it looks like they heard
their testicles might be on fire.

01:03:00.116 --> 01:03:01.950
I haven't seen Frank
run like that ever.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:03.995
Can we help prepare the ground?

01:03:03.995 --> 01:03:07.915
Well, it's going to be a fairly
explosive megafuck, so yeah.

01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:09.958
The GoJo deal is going to die.

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:14.462
Frank maybe pulls the vote
or they push and get humiliated.

01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:15.923
So, yeah.

01:03:15.923 --> 01:03:19.593
Big, big day
on the old salami line, huh?

01:03:19.593 --> 01:03:21.012
Yeah, it sure is.

01:03:21.012 --> 01:03:23.972
- I'll get you the materials.
- Okay.

01:03:23.972 --> 01:03:28.436
Details on the financing for background
for the journal piece.

01:03:30.812 --> 01:03:32.397
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

01:03:32.397 --> 01:03:34.899
It's not a magic chair.
Yeah, go ahead.

01:03:39.822 --> 01:03:40.990
Okay.

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.867
Hey, hey, hey.
How we looking?

01:03:42.867 --> 01:03:45.036
Hey, dude. We have it.

01:03:45.661 --> 01:03:47.621
Okay? We have it.

01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:51.208
But do we have you?
We've got you, right?

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.084
Well, I do have certain questions

01:03:53.084 --> 01:03:57.756
about riding the vegetable train,
but I am a selfish person, so...

01:03:59.091 --> 01:04:02.635
- Yeah.
- Do we invite the Stewpot in?

01:04:03.387 --> 01:04:06.139
You know, get him inside.
Non-exec chair.

01:04:06.139 --> 01:04:08.643
Fucking activist backtivist.

01:04:09.018 --> 01:04:14.231
Chair? Guys, I like weird sex.
I like bad drugs.

01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:18.319
- I'm a very complicated individual.
- Bullshit.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:21.947
You like pancakes and waffles
and you kiss guys on Molly.

01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:23.448
You're not the heart of darkness.

01:04:23.448 --> 01:04:26.243
You're a grilled cheese
with a sucked dick.

01:04:26.243 --> 01:04:27.745
Let us clean you up.

01:04:27.745 --> 01:04:30.289
Well, why don't we just think
about it, huh?

01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:34.376
And Shiv, you know,

01:04:34.376 --> 01:04:39.256
I do think if we give Sandy a little
tug, she might be somewhat foldable.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:42.217
Okay, great. Perfect.
Let's go.

01:04:42.802 --> 01:04:45.387
And you did a fucking good one, man.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.016
- Yeah?
- Chairman Stewpot. I'm into that.

01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:51.268
Are you into that, Shiv?

01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:57.232
Hey, what's she doing in?

01:04:58.067 --> 01:04:59.818
- Who?
- Gerri, what's she doing here?

01:05:01.903 --> 01:05:03.197
I don't know.

01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:06.492
I think we're paying her off big time,
so it's not a lock-out, right?

01:05:06.867 --> 01:05:10.079
I don't want to see her.
Should she even be around?

01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:12.997
Yeah, sure.
Let's fuck her out.

01:05:12.997 --> 01:05:15.500
Yeah, I don't think I really want
to see anyone.

01:05:16.919 --> 01:05:18.086
You okay?

01:05:18.086 --> 01:05:20.839
Yeah, I think I'm going to call in.
I think I'm going to call in the vote.

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:23.175
I think I'm going to, yeah.
I don't want to...

01:05:24.801 --> 01:05:27.305
Yeah, I think, man...

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.850
People kind of know you're here.

01:05:31.641 --> 01:05:35.437
You know, show of force.
Are you okay?

01:05:37.606 --> 01:05:42.278
Yeah, it looks better than I thought.
It looks so much better.

01:05:42.694 --> 01:05:44.572
Yeah, it does.

01:05:44.572 --> 01:05:49.325
Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to be
like, "Why isn't it me?"

01:05:49.325 --> 01:05:51.746
- You know?
- Sure.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.874
I mean, it could have been you, Rome.

01:05:55.665 --> 01:06:00.630
It could easily have been you.
It's just marginal presentation shit.

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:03.506
You'll have something shit hot.
Socials, right?

01:06:03.506 --> 01:06:06.469
No, but it's just,
you know, the optics.

01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:09.721
It's dumb, but the stitches,
they're good.

01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:13.892
- Stitches, they're good.
- This is 90% about the visuals.

01:06:13.892 --> 01:06:17.979
I mean, just if people
think that I like, pussied out,

01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:20.607
then I don't think that
I should, you know...

01:06:22.233 --> 01:06:24.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I can't.

01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:26.821
No, I can't, because,
you know, I look okay.

01:06:26.821 --> 01:06:30.992
This looks fine, so, you know,
it's fucking stupid, but...

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.248
Like, why isn't it me?

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:43.798
Bro...

01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:52.597
Okay. All right.

01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:55.725
Jesus. Fuck.

01:06:59.854 --> 01:07:01.231
Fuck!

01:07:15.954 --> 01:07:17.497
You fucking bastard.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.427
- I love you, man.
- Shit. I fucking hate you.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.391
We'll be okay, all right?
We're gonna do good.

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:40.771
Teamwork makes the dream work.

01:07:46.234 --> 01:07:47.987
It could have been you.

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:03.127
GROWING THE EMPIRE

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.262
Simon, how are you? Good to see you.
Thanks for being here.

01:08:58.598 --> 01:09:00.351
Ewan. New York's finest?

01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:03.521
Absolutely.
Appreciate it.

01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:05.690
All right, let's call
this meeting to order.

01:09:06.816 --> 01:09:08.901
I note that all the directors
are present.

01:09:09.693 --> 01:09:13.655
The agenda and the information
packs have been circulated,

01:09:13.655 --> 01:09:16.242
and I would like to take them as read.

01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:20.246
We have a revised offer
to consider from the GoJo board,

01:09:20.246 --> 01:09:22.747
and a lot of work has been done
to get us to a position

01:09:22.747 --> 01:09:25.250
where we're ready to sign,
if the board agrees.

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:27.461
As you also, of course, are aware,

01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:32.132
we will be hearing from our co-CEOs
about strategic alternatives.

01:09:32.132 --> 01:09:34.885
We've aired the issues
and heard from our advisors

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:36.678
on the GoJo proposal
in the previous session,

01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:39.598
so now I'd like to hand the floor
to Kendall.

01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:42.768
Yeah, the GoJo offer...

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:49.066
Yeah, this deal,
the deal is a bad deal.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:51.317
The GoJo offer.

01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:55.488
We were proud to land it,
me and Rome.

01:09:56.198 --> 01:09:59.075
We know it inside out,
but it's a bad deal,

01:09:59.075 --> 01:10:00.744
and if you want it to go through,

01:10:00.744 --> 01:10:03.288
you'll have to fire me and find
someone else to take it through.

01:10:03.288 --> 01:10:04.956
Yeah?

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:07.835
I think you have your packs here,

01:10:07.835 --> 01:10:10.755
with the structural arguments
and the financing options,

01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:13.631
and, look, it's a nice thick pack.

01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:19.180
We've knocked it out of the park,
and, GoJo Matsson is flailing.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:20.555
We know that.

01:10:21.139 --> 01:10:26.562
So, look, we know each other.
I've spoken to you all.

01:10:27.063 --> 01:10:29.856
I like and respect every one of you,

01:10:29.856 --> 01:10:33.694
but no one's gonna have their
mind changed in here, right?

01:10:34.403 --> 01:10:37.573
So I suggest we move to the vote,

01:10:37.573 --> 01:10:42.285
kill this, excuse me, GoJo bullshit,
and, you know, let's eat their lunch.

01:10:42.285 --> 01:10:43.495
Ken.

01:10:43.495 --> 01:10:45.580
What, you want me to read it out
for due process?

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.750
Come on, we have the votes.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.586
I would rather... Simon.

01:10:50.586 --> 01:10:53.673
Let's do it for my dad, guys. Yeah?

01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:57.926
Would anyone object
to moving directly to a vote?

01:10:57.926 --> 01:10:59.845
No.

01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.430
Very well.

01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:06.060
So, yes, I think it's a good deal.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:10.606
I can't in good conscience as chair
vote any other way.

01:11:12.733 --> 01:11:14.484
- Sonya?
- Yes.

01:11:15.987 --> 01:11:17.113
- Diane?
- Yes.

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:18.697
Kendall.

01:11:18.697 --> 01:11:21.909
You know my vote.
No. No to GoJo.

01:11:24.078 --> 01:11:28.832
Yes.
And yes, we want out.

01:11:30.418 --> 01:11:32.336
No. I'm against.

01:11:35.422 --> 01:11:39.217
First, do no harm. Nay.

01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:43.513
Team Ken, baby. I'm a no.

01:11:45.432 --> 01:11:46.850
Roman.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.985
Nope.

01:11:56.985 --> 01:11:58.571
That's fucking right.

01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:04.118
Shiv.

01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:09.248
Shiv?

01:12:12.126 --> 01:12:14.462
This is going...

01:12:15.003 --> 01:12:16.339
Shiv?

01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:21.636
It's all good. It's all good.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.054
Just a moment, please.

01:12:28.516 --> 01:12:32.229
Paul's vote is yes.
It's six to six.

01:12:41.405 --> 01:12:43.865
Hey, you okay? We have it.

01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:46.284
Look, look, look. We have it.

01:12:46.869 --> 01:12:48.954
Right? We have it.
Are you scared?

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.081
- I'm not scared.
- Are you sick?

01:12:51.081 --> 01:12:54.250
- No, I'm not scared.
- Are you good?

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:59.131
Yeah, can I have a moment, please?
Just fuck off. I just need a moment.

01:13:00.632 --> 01:13:03.718
- I want to think.
- Okay.

01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:06.096
Think about what?

01:13:06.096 --> 01:13:08.056
Whether you want us
to keep the company

01:13:08.056 --> 01:13:11.267
or hand it over to Tom and that piece
of shit who killed our dad?

01:13:12.143 --> 01:13:14.104
I might have changed my mind.

01:13:15.355 --> 01:13:16.941
What the fuck?

01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:24.572
I'm good for this company.
I'm good for us.

01:13:24.572 --> 01:13:26.658
We all vote. We keep control.

01:13:26.658 --> 01:13:29.286
We don't,
then everything's over forever.

01:13:29.286 --> 01:13:31.955
Here's the thing.
I am like a cog

01:13:31.955 --> 01:13:34.958
built to fit only one machine.

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:39.045
If you don't let me do this,
it's the one thing I know how to do.

01:13:39.045 --> 01:13:41.757
- Well, it's not all about you.
- I know.

01:13:41.757 --> 01:13:44.010
You are not the most important one.

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.635
I don't think I am.

01:13:45.635 --> 01:13:48.596
Yes, you do. You do. You fucking do.

01:13:48.596 --> 01:13:49.848
You do.

01:13:49.848 --> 01:13:54.562
But Shiv, honestly, it's so fucking
crazy not to just let me now...

01:13:54.562 --> 01:13:59.692
It's stupid.
We all get something here.

01:13:59.692 --> 01:14:01.944
I mean, you're voting against yourself.
You realize that?

01:14:03.486 --> 01:14:06.991
Shiv, listen, please.
I beg you.

01:14:06.991 --> 01:14:11.369
- Listen, I can do this.
- I don't think you'd be good at it.

01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:14.290
What? I don't even believe you.
I don't believe you.

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:17.751
I don't. I don't think that you would be
good at this.

01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:21.589
For fuck's sake, Shiv.
I mean, for fuck's sake.

01:14:22.465 --> 01:14:24.007
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:24.007 --> 01:14:27.845
It's six to six,
and we don't have Shiv's vote.

01:14:27.845 --> 01:14:31.556
This doesn't make, like, logic.
Where's the logic?

01:14:31.556 --> 01:14:34.226
I just don't think you'd be good at it.

01:14:37.146 --> 01:14:40.690
I feel like if I don't get to do this,

01:14:41.733 --> 01:14:48.407
I feel like that's it.
Like I might die.

01:14:48.866 --> 01:14:52.035
Shiv, can we go in that room?
Can you just vote?

01:14:52.035 --> 01:14:54.872
Please.

01:14:55.915 --> 01:14:59.919
You can't be CEO. You can't,
because you killed someone.

01:14:59.919 --> 01:15:02.587
- Which?
- What?

01:15:02.587 --> 01:15:08.802
Which? What, like, you killed so
many people, you forgot which one?

01:15:10.346 --> 01:15:12.431
That's not an issue.

01:15:14.224 --> 01:15:15.559
That didn't happen.

01:15:15.559 --> 01:15:17.227
Wait, it didn't? As in what?

01:15:17.227 --> 01:15:19.855
It's just a thing I said.
I made it up.

01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.732
You made it up?

01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:24.609
It was a difficult time for us,

01:15:24.609 --> 01:15:27.696
and I think I mussed up something
from nothing,

01:15:27.696 --> 01:15:31.409
because I wanted for us
all to bond at a difficult moment.

01:15:31.409 --> 01:15:34.745
- Wait, it was a move?
- There was a kid.

01:15:34.745 --> 01:15:36.204
So there was a kid?

01:15:36.204 --> 01:15:39.750
I had a toke and a beer.
I didn't even get in the car.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:41.794
- Hold on.
- What the fuck?

01:15:41.794 --> 01:15:44.629
I felt bad, and I false-memoried it.

01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:46.548
I'm totally clean. I can do this.

01:15:46.548 --> 01:15:48.675
Wait, did it happen
or did it not happen?

01:15:48.675 --> 01:15:50.593
It did not happen.

01:15:51.803 --> 01:15:54.390
It did not happen. I wasn't even there.

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:56.766
It did not happen.

01:15:57.142 --> 01:15:58.602
Dude.

01:15:59.144 --> 01:16:01.187
Fucking vote for me.

01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:04.900
Just please, vote for me.
Shiv, vote for me.

01:16:06.276 --> 01:16:07.611
No.

01:16:08.361 --> 01:16:09.989
- Yes!
- No.

01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:11.991
Shiv, don't do this. You can't do this.

01:16:11.991 --> 01:16:15.244
Absolutely not, man.
Absolutely not.

01:16:15.244 --> 01:16:16.828
- No.
- Why?

01:16:16.828 --> 01:16:19.748
Why? I love you.

01:16:19.748 --> 01:16:23.209
I really love you, but I can't
fucking stomach you.

01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:25.879
This is fucking disgusting.
It's disgusting.

01:16:25.879 --> 01:16:27.255
It's disgusting?

01:16:27.255 --> 01:16:29.257
You're disgusting.
You're fucking heartless.

01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:32.469
It's fucking nuts. It doesn't even
make any sense.

01:16:34.013 --> 01:16:35.597
I'm the eldest boy!

01:16:37.016 --> 01:16:39.601
- I am the eldest boy.
- You're not.

01:16:39.601 --> 01:16:42.355
It mattered to him.
He wanted this to go on.

01:16:42.355 --> 01:16:45.023
Well, I mean,
she's the bloodline, though.

01:16:45.023 --> 01:16:48.068
What? I'm the bloodline.
We're all the fucking bloodlines.

01:16:48.068 --> 01:16:49.528
I just mean if you're gonna play
that card,

01:16:49.528 --> 01:16:51.405
Dad's view was yours weren't real.

01:16:51.405 --> 01:16:54.825
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Well, just not real-real.

01:16:54.825 --> 01:16:58.286
That's just what Dad said.
I'm just saying what Dad said.

01:16:58.286 --> 01:17:01.498
Well, don't say it, you fucking cuck.

01:17:01.498 --> 01:17:03.750
They are a pair of randos.

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.711
One is a buy-in.
The other is half-Rava,

01:17:06.711 --> 01:17:08.797
half-some filing cabinet guy, right?

01:17:10.216 --> 01:17:12.967
- What the fuck? Let go of him.
- What did you say?

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.137
- Stop!
- What did you say?

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:17.640
- Fuck's sake.
- Don't do this.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.059
- Hold on a second.
- Fuck off me.

01:17:20.059 --> 01:17:21.769
- You piece of shit!
- Get off me.

01:17:21.769 --> 01:17:23.561
Jesus Christ.

01:17:24.604 --> 01:17:26.523
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:17:26.983 --> 01:17:29.484
Shiv, no. Wait. Shiv, wait.

01:17:29.484 --> 01:17:31.695
- Fuck you.
- Can you fucking leave her?

01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:33.197
Fucking child!

01:17:54.843 --> 01:17:58.763
Let's hit Frank.
We can still do this.

01:17:58.763 --> 01:18:01.392
Bullshit, man. Come on.
It's fucking nothing. Stop.

01:18:01.392 --> 01:18:03.268
There's something here.
There's an angle.

01:18:03.268 --> 01:18:05.145
No, no, no.
It's fuck all, man.

01:18:05.145 --> 01:18:06.814
It's bits of glue and broken shows,

01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:10.943
fucking phony news.
Fucking... Come on!

01:18:11.317 --> 01:18:12.862
We have this. We can still do this.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:15.948
Oh, my God, man. It's nothing.
It's just nothing. It's fucking nothing.

01:18:15.948 --> 01:18:17.408
Stop it.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.952
No, no, no, no!

01:18:21.579 --> 01:18:23.622
We are bullshit.

01:18:26.916 --> 01:18:28.377
We are not bullshit.

01:18:28.377 --> 01:18:30.588
We are bullshit.
You are bullshit.

01:18:30.588 --> 01:18:32.130
You're fucking bullshit, man.

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:35.550
I'm fucking bullshit. She's bullshit.
It's all fucking nothing.

01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:39.972
Man, I'm telling you this because
I know it, okay? We're nothing.

01:18:41.473 --> 01:18:43.059
Okay...

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:45.561
Okay.

01:19:24.265 --> 01:19:28.395
Hey, pardon me. Where are we?

01:19:29.813 --> 01:19:30.940
Ken.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:37.571
I was thinking that we adjourn
the meeting and...

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.449
Ken, it's done.

01:19:42.075 --> 01:19:45.997
7-6. We sell it to GoJo.
You don't have it.

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.925
We're good.

01:20:46.432 --> 01:20:48.892
So what are you thinking?
Golden parachute?

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:52.563
- Or one last rodeo.
- Go on.

01:20:52.563 --> 01:20:54.064
What do you think?

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:58.276
I'm thinking we should have
slit his throat in the cradle.

01:20:58.903 --> 01:21:00.236
Well, it goes without saying.

01:21:00.236 --> 01:21:02.865
I'm thrilled for you.
Let's fucking do it.

01:21:02.865 --> 01:21:05.993
- Please, let's talk.
- Hey, man. Great one.

01:21:06.869 --> 01:21:11.290
The losers never triumph.
I was always hoping, you know.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.168
So, let's chat. I got you.

01:21:15.168 --> 01:21:16.754
Where's Karolina?

01:21:17.212 --> 01:21:19.757
Karolina? She's...

01:21:26.973 --> 01:21:28.598
Congratulations, Tom!

01:21:30.267 --> 01:21:32.937
- I just wanted to say congrats.
- Thanks.

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:38.900
Tom. Just phenomenal.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.944
Pastures new, right?
This is it.

01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:48.535
How's it all looking?

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:57.003
- Plans? Planning?
- I want to talk to Gerri.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:21:59.671
Gerri gets it.
She's not afraid of the dark.

01:22:00.714 --> 01:22:02.007
And who else?

01:22:02.924 --> 01:22:05.802
Frank, dead, Carl, dead.

01:22:05.802 --> 01:22:09.305
I really don't need those
two old cunts on my shoulder.

01:22:13.101 --> 01:22:14.477
You.

01:22:15.813 --> 01:22:17.106
You fucked it, man.

01:22:17.106 --> 01:22:20.817
Quad man. Matsson hates you.
Wants to clean-out.

01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:23.237
Fuck.

01:22:23.653 --> 01:22:27.616
You are a fucking piece of shit.

01:22:33.204 --> 01:22:37.001
But I got you.
I got just enough capital.

01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:42.840
I got you.

01:22:47.345 --> 01:22:50.348
Okay. All right. Hey, guys. Hi.

01:22:50.348 --> 01:22:51.515
So we're good to go?

01:22:51.515 --> 01:22:53.309
Seems to be a little bit
of a communication break.

01:22:53.309 --> 01:22:55.686
Don't mind signing the fucking thing.
That's fine.

01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:58.481
We need you to come in right now
to complete this ceremony.

01:22:58.481 --> 01:23:00.357
Bring me the piece of paper
and I'll sign it.

01:23:00.357 --> 01:23:02.400
We're going to do it at the desk.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.487
- I have to be in the room with him?
- This is being a CEO.

01:23:05.487 --> 01:23:06.864
One quick photo.

01:23:06.864 --> 01:23:08.782
I already told you I'm not taking
a fucking photo.

01:23:08.782 --> 01:23:13.371
Let's fucking do it. Take a photo.
Take all the pictures you want.

01:23:13.371 --> 01:23:15.623
Big day. Happy. Good stuff.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:18.250
Great.

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:20.836
Okay, here we go. Thank you.

01:23:25.465 --> 01:23:27.550
What's the return policy
on this, by the way?

01:23:29.469 --> 01:23:30.805
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:23:32.306 --> 01:23:34.432
Love you, Roman.
Thank you, man.

01:23:34.432 --> 01:23:36.352
Okay, let's get Frank and Karl
in here.

01:23:36.352 --> 01:23:41.273
GoJo team, Frank and Karl.
Guys, get closer together, please.

01:23:41.273 --> 01:23:44.402
Good smile. Wonderful.
One, two, three.

01:23:44.402 --> 01:23:45.695
This is the new team.

01:23:46.194 --> 01:23:47.697
Jesus and his disciples.

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:53.077
Even Judas is in the room.
There we go.

01:23:53.451 --> 01:23:54.829
Why not just a GoJo one?

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:59.624
Yeah, let's do the GoJo photo.
Just the three of you, okay?

01:23:59.624 --> 01:24:02.211
- Three musketeers.
- One, two, three. Wonderful.

01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:05.046
Let's just do a single.
Single on Matsson.

01:24:05.631 --> 01:24:08.551
I got a car in 20
if you want to join.

01:24:08.925 --> 01:24:10.469
Okay, thank you.

01:24:10.469 --> 01:24:13.639
- Let's party!
- A little bubbly-bubbly!

01:25:07.609 --> 01:25:08.819
Hey.

01:25:10.279 --> 01:25:11.613
Hey!

01:25:19.037 --> 01:25:21.998
- Congratulations!
- No, no.
