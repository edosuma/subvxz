Clothe yourself
in white for protection.

01:28.458 --> 01:29.291
Thank you.

03:47.791 --> 03:49.166
I'm sorry, boss.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.583
She hasn't spoken.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.708
Watch them.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.833
What is that bastard doing?

17:16.291 --> 17:18.041
Check her out.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.375
Can I help you?

17:36.916 --> 17:38.000
It'd be my pleasure.

17:38.750 --> 17:39.708
Let go of the handbag.

17:39.791 --> 17:40.750
Don't make a scene.

17:41.583 --> 17:42.541
We know what you're doing.

17:42.625 --> 17:43.583
Walk.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.250
Get down!

21:33.333 --> 21:34.916
Where's the boss?

21:35.666 --> 21:36.708
Where?

21:36.791 --> 21:37.750
The boss!

23:11.291 --> 23:12.250
Where are the keys?

23:12.333 --> 23:13.291
They're inside!

26:28.458 --> 26:30.291
...Holy Spirit, amen.

26:54.458 --> 26:55.875
Where were you?

26:55.958 --> 26:57.583
They're all dead, asshole.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.000
Get out, bastard.

27:12.875 --> 27:13.833
Get out.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.416
Where did you go?

28:02.833 --> 28:04.833
<i>I have one of them.</i>

28:07.000 --> 28:07.958
For now.

29:24.625 --> 29:25.583
It's me.

29:57.708 --> 29:58.666
Man, it's hot.

29:59.375 --> 30:00.333
He's here.

30:10.958 --> 30:11.916
Move it, bastard.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.208
Emilia, is that you?

37:43.083 --> 37:44.583
What do we do with this guy?
