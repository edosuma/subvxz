00:03.737 --> 00:06.001
<i>When you're little, nighttime is scary</i>

00:06.039 --> 00:09.668
<i>because there are monsters</i>
<i>hiding right under the bed.</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:14.271
<i>When you get older,</i>
<i>the monsters are different.</i>

00:15.615 --> 00:17.446
<i>Self doubt...</i>

00:18.918 --> 00:20.647
<i>...loneliness...</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:24.547
<i>...regret.</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:27.651
<i>And though you may be</i>
<i>older and wiser,</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:30.094
<i>you still find yourself</i>
<i>scared of the dark.</i>

00:32.564 --> 00:35.659
- I'm crazy. That's what this is.
- You're not crazy.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.398
Then what is this? What...?
What are you?

00:38.438 --> 00:42.534
- I'm a dead man who loves you.
- This is my imagination.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.339
- I have an active imagination.
- You touched me.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.312
When you were alive. And kissed you.

00:47.347 --> 00:50.783
Everything that's happening
happened. I'm reliving moments.

00:50.817 --> 00:53.081
This is just residual grief.

00:55.855 --> 00:59.347
So I guess the only way to test it
is to do something

00:59.392 --> 01:02.361
we never got a chance
to do in real life.

01:38.998 --> 01:42.092
- Dr. Yang.
- Dr. Hunt.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.659
Uh...

01:44.838 --> 01:48.831
- You here for me?
- What?

01:48.875 --> 01:52.675
I meant my trauma.

01:52.712 --> 01:56.375
I'm here for a possible appy.
Ambulance is on its way in.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.045
Hey...

02:05.191 --> 02:07.159
Did you want to say something?

02:10.597 --> 02:12.224
How'd you beat the ambulance?

02:14.501 --> 02:16.901
I live across the street.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.705
Your sofa sucks. I can't sleep.

02:28.748 --> 02:32.514
- I never went to bed.
- Usually read on the bathroom floor?

02:32.552 --> 02:36.147
I didn't want to wake Derek.
These are my mother's journals.

02:36.189 --> 02:39.556
- From when she was a resident.
- I thought we hated your mother.

02:39.592 --> 02:43.028
I kind of think now, if I wasn't
her child, I would have liked her.

02:43.062 --> 02:46.793
She was funny. And intense.
A lot like Cristina.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.030
Yeah. Intense, I get from Cristina.
Funny, not so much.

02:50.069 --> 02:54.369
She takes a while to warm up,
but when she does, she's Cristina.

02:54.407 --> 02:57.570
Give her a chance. She's very loyal,
and you need allies here.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.807
What do you think about...
what's her name, your sister, Lexie?

03:00.847 --> 03:04.180
- What do I think about her?
- As an ally for me.

03:04.217 --> 03:08.711
- My new intern BFF.
- No, I... No, I don't see that.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.781
I just... She was raised right.
With parents and rules

03:11.824 --> 03:14.884
- and smiley face posters on her wall.
- Mm.

03:17.497 --> 03:21.524
It's Cristina. There's an appy.
See? Loyalty.

03:23.636 --> 03:27.299
I'll come with you. Try to snag time
in the skills lab. I'll get dressed.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.638
Oh, my God!

03:31.578 --> 03:33.307
- Hot.
- Porny.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.941
What... What are you doing out here?

03:37.984 --> 03:41.010
You're the only one who paid
a nurse to page you with an appy?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.682
- That's not what I meant.
- Yes!

03:43.723 --> 03:47.386
That's what I meant. If you're out here,
who's in there with Izzie?

03:47.427 --> 03:51.056
- Oh, my God!
- Derek?

03:51.097 --> 03:54.931
- What? What? What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.435
I just...

03:56.469 --> 03:59.370
What are you doing dressed?
It's three in the morning.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.132
Who's making a porno in Izzie's room?

04:03.176 --> 04:05.736
Relax, she's flying solo. It's hot.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.242
Iz, party's over.
We got an appy coming in.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.615
Death, let's go.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.815
- She's living here, too, Death?
- Just a couple of days,

04:15.855 --> 04:18.016
- till she gets her place.
- No more strays.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.524
- No more strays.
- Iz!

04:20.560 --> 04:24.326
- Iz, come on!
- Hey. Hi.

04:24.364 --> 04:28.698
So I'm not feeling that great.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.932
I think I'm gonna skip it.
I don't know, I think I have the flu

04:31.971 --> 04:36.340
- or food poisoning... Yeah. I'm hot.
- You're sweating.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.970
And cold. Hot and cold.
I have the chills.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.675
- I'm just gonna go back to bed.
- Didn't sound like you were sleeping.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.411
I could skip the appy
and help you out if you want.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.385
No! No, I'm...

04:47.420 --> 04:49.888
I don't want to get you sick, too.

04:53.192 --> 04:55.353
- What are you doing here?
- He's mine.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.659
- She's sharing him with me.
- I'm on call.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.098
- Good morning, you look nice.
- Brownnoser. I got here first.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.535
- The chief said I'm the one to watch.
- Oh, I get it.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.767
Solo surgery time, and you heard
the past two years the chief

05:07.807 --> 05:09.900
assigned an appendectomy.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.410
So you little mini-surgeons
dragged your butts

05:12.445 --> 05:17.246
out of bed to pick up some final tips
from the master. That's kind of cute.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.649
- I can use two of you.
- But I'm on call!

05:19.719 --> 05:22.187
- I filled Meredith in.
- Jason Kron, 47,

05:22.221 --> 05:25.486
- tenderness over McBurney's point.
- Karev, what do you know

05:25.525 --> 05:27.959
- about Mr. Kron?
- I know he's a lucky man

05:27.994 --> 05:30.656
- to have you as a surgeon.
- Arthur Soltanoff, 45,

05:30.697 --> 05:34.064
fell from a second-story window.
Stable vitals, fractures

05:34.100 --> 05:37.126
- and lacerations with head trauma.
- Trauma One.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.001
I need one of your residents.

05:39.038 --> 05:40.972
- Me! Mine. I'm on call!
- It's yours.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.875
We have a patient with abdominal
pain. Can you spare a resident?

05:44.911 --> 05:47.607
Grey and Yang,
prep Mr. Kron for surgery.

05:47.647 --> 05:51.378
Karev, you never know, abdominal
pain could become an appendectomy.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.147
Dr. Bailey, I'm here to help
in any way that I can.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.417
There's a patient in pain, I'm there.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.985
Can you feel that there?
Can you feel that?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.327
There's no need for you to do that.
I can feel that.

06:06.332 --> 06:11.292
The residents are here. In the hospital,
so whatever you're doing...

06:11.337 --> 06:13.862
- What are you doing?
- We gave him an epidural.

06:13.906 --> 06:15.999
- And didn't call me?
- It just happened.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.705
You know, epidurals don't just
happen. I'm staying at Death's.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.907
- Staying at Meredith's? What?
- Lexie!

06:21.948 --> 06:25.907
- Dude. He peed himself.
- We forgot the catheter!

06:25.952 --> 06:28.716
- No catheters!
- Do you wanna pee yourself again?

06:28.755 --> 06:33.021
- No.
- An epidural. Wow. I'm impressed.

06:33.059 --> 06:37.018
- Death is so wrong about you.
- Why? What did she say?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.621
That you were a priss.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.929
Too bad he's not pregnant.
We could do a C-section.

06:42.969 --> 06:46.132
- We could take out his appendix.
- Or amputate his foot.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.106
Seriously.

06:49.976 --> 06:54.709
- He doesn't need his appendix.
- We could take out his appendix.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.238
We'll find an empty OR,
in and out in an hour.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.683
- I'm sitting right here.
- You could watch.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.279
We wouldn't put you under.
Stay on the epidural.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.916
I'm off tomorrow. I'd trade and take
his shift so he could recover.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.018
- They're all here.
- They're busy chasing solo surgery.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.757
It's a genius idea.
We would be rock stars.

07:11.798 --> 07:17.065
No! I draw the line at a tube
in my penis. Line drawn!

07:17.103 --> 07:20.937
Fine. Do me.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.636
As long as I can do
one of you guys next.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.771
- Done.
- Done.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.781
- What have we got?
- Massive injuries.

07:30.817 --> 07:34.150
Shepherd and Hunt are working.
Sleepwalking and took a header

07:34.187 --> 07:37.486
- through a window. Night terrors.
- Can you imagine?

07:37.523 --> 07:40.959
You wake up, you're battered,
bruised, don't know where you are

07:40.993 --> 07:43.018
- or how you got there?
- Like my life:

07:43.062 --> 07:46.657
Married, betrayed, gay, abandoned.
Wake up, no idea how I got here.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.395
I just figured this is the bottom,
as bad as it gets.

07:49.435 --> 07:53.565
- It can only go up from here.
- Tib-fib. Trauma series is clear.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.767
- Needs a head CT.
- Free fluid in there.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.333
Oh, God. Ivy, get out of the way!

07:58.377 --> 08:00.709
- The mountain lion's there!
- You're in a hospital.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.214
- Ivy! Where's my daughter?
- I'm right here.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.774
He's gonna get my daughter!
Let me go!

08:05.818 --> 08:08.013
- I've gotta get my daughter!
- Calm down.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.080
- He's gonna get Ivy!
- Mr. Soltanoff, calm down!

08:17.930 --> 08:19.898
Let go! She needs me!

08:22.268 --> 08:25.135
OK. Bailey's got an appy in OR 2,
so this floor's out.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.106
But outpatient surgery is totally open.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.109
- OK, let's go.
- Looking for something?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.438
Hi.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.472
We were giving Sadie the tour.
This is the OR Board.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.884
And this is a patient.
You're in good hands.

08:41.921 --> 08:46.017
- Dr. Grey is an excellent doctor.
- What's next on the tour?

08:47.894 --> 08:51.557
- Back to skills lab?
- Skills lab, great idea.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.699
- Gotta stick with my allies.
- Smiley face posters.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.169
That's all I'm saying.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.071
Mrs. Hammer, what seems
to be the problem?

09:01.107 --> 09:04.838
I have this pain in my stomach
and I can't keep food down.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.812
- It goes through me.
- Tell him your theory, Lauren.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.577
- She has a theory.
- I'm right here, I can speak.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.585
Thinks she has stomach cancer.
The Internet told her.

09:13.619 --> 09:17.282
I'm not a hypochondriac!
He's not inside my body.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.053
I have a theory, too.
Crazy disease. Diarrhea.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.720
- Seth.
- Fine. Shutting up.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.923
Let's take a look.

09:24.964 --> 09:28.559
You're not tender over your appendix.
We don't need to take that out.

09:28.601 --> 09:32.264
That's a good thing, right?
You look upset.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.966
Just disappointed... for you.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.066
I'm gonna have to collect
a stool sample.

09:38.344 --> 09:42.007
I can't believe this is happening.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.506
- It wasn't a great nose, anyway.
- Yes, it was.

09:45.551 --> 09:49.317
- It was a nice nose.
- Relax, I was kidding.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.755
It was a gorgeous nose
and it will be again.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.192
- Two weeks, won't be able to tell.
- Really?

09:55.227 --> 09:57.491
- Three weeks. Four tops.
- I hate you.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.157
- You love me. Little pinch.
- Ow!

09:59.198 --> 10:01.462
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

10:01.500 --> 10:04.230
Come on, that didn't hurt.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.801
Maybe if I was having a good year,
it would feel like a little pinch.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.777
But it hurts, Mark. It hurts a lot!

10:12.812 --> 10:17.408
You know what? I was gonna
do this with some local,

10:17.450 --> 10:20.544
but I think we'll use conscious
sedation. When you wake up,

10:20.620 --> 10:23.487
your nose will be fixed
and it'll be a whole new day.

10:23.522 --> 10:27.288
OK. Well, at least I still have you.

10:27.326 --> 10:30.352
You'll still be my friend
and have sex with me when I want.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.988
Anytime.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.499
You know, once your face heals.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.495
- I hate you.
- You love me.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.197
I hit a doctor?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.800
I don't understand.
What am I even doing here?

10:43.843 --> 10:47.802
Your daughter said you were having
a dream and jumped out the window.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.816
- Have a history of sleepwalking?
- It started years ago,

10:50.850 --> 10:55.184
when my wife died. Scared me
so much, I went to a sleep clinic.

10:55.221 --> 11:00.124
They said it was stress-induced,
and gave me some clonazepam.

11:00.192 --> 11:04.094
- How's that been working?
- I'm raising a 13 year old,

11:04.163 --> 11:07.530
so stress comes with the job.
I haven't had an episode in a while.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.760
I must have forgotten
to take my pill tonight.

11:11.804 --> 11:15.763
Honey, I'm so sorry.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.436
- You must have been so scared.
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.379
- I'm just worried about you.
- I'm sorry.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.555
Dr. Sloan. Hi. Hello.

11:30.589 --> 11:34.753
Know where they keep the IV kits?
Where are all the damn interns?

11:34.827 --> 11:37.887
The interns are... interning.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.932
- Busily interning. They're very busy.
- Dr. Sloan.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.458
- Little Grey.
- I need some medical supplies.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.495
Found the intern in the supply closet.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.703
Did not invite the intern
into the supply closet.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.938
- Go away now, Grey.
- Thank you.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.780
Stop looking at me.
I didn't do anything.

11:57.817 --> 12:01.048
- Don't do anything. Don't.
- I didn't. I didn't.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.923
Dr. Bailey, do you have to visualize
the peritoneum?

12:05.958 --> 12:10.418
Depends. I've seen so many,
usually just feel it.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.090
Did you split the muscle
this way or that way?

12:13.165 --> 12:15.725
This way. No, that... Hold it.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.703
That way. It's the kind of thing
that becomes so natural,

12:18.738 --> 12:21.263
you don't even think about it
after a while.

12:24.543 --> 12:29.776
The two of you are thinking so hard,
it makes me tired just looking at you.

12:29.815 --> 12:33.273
- This is so cool.
- Can you believe we're doing this?

12:33.352 --> 12:35.616
The epidural should be working.

12:35.654 --> 12:41.286
OK, she's numbed. We're ready.
OK. Here we go.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.592
- You OK?
- I find the fact you have parents

12:44.663 --> 12:47.257
and smiley face posters
oddly comforting.

12:47.299 --> 12:50.598
- What?
- I'm ready.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.434
Surgical marker.
I'm going to mark the incision.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.735
Can you hold that
a little bit closer, please?

12:59.812 --> 13:04.215
One third the distance
from the anterior superior iliac spine

13:04.250 --> 13:06.411
to the umbilicus. OK.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.746
That's right about...

13:17.196 --> 13:18.629
OK.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.490
It's a great day to save lives, people.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.595
Although, technically,
your life is just fine. And...

13:25.638 --> 13:27.606
It's night-time.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.006
- Shepherd says that...
- Could you just go?

13:30.042 --> 13:31.168
Scalpel.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.472
OK...

13:42.755 --> 13:45.952
This is a bad idea.
This is a really bad idea.

13:45.991 --> 13:49.188
And it's the middle of the night,
so our judgment is... off.

13:49.228 --> 13:53.358
But we can use this frustration that
we feel that's driven us to the point

13:53.399 --> 13:55.526
where we're about
to do a stupid thing,

13:55.568 --> 13:58.662
a thing I'm certain we'd all regret,
possibly from jail.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.696
And we can use
that frustration for good.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.642
We can ask for more time in the skills
lab, ask to observe more surgeries,

14:05.678 --> 14:09.079
and we can demand
that our residents teach us better.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.349
Or we can just take out my appendix.

14:24.230 --> 14:28.530
OK. I'm following the taeniae coli
down to expose the appendix.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.728
- Wow.
- There it is.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.260
- I want to see.
- Get her a mirror.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.734
- Ooh! Cool.
- Hmm.

14:38.777 --> 14:43.942
- What?
- Does it look a little inflamed to you?

14:43.983 --> 14:46.952
It does a little.
It looks inflamed.

14:46.986 --> 14:50.581
- Can I see a book?
- It's normally only supposed to be

14:50.623 --> 14:53.023
seven to eight millimeters in diameter.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.458
Yeah. It looks a little big.

14:55.494 --> 14:58.520
If it's inflamed,
this isn't a routine procedure.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.692
It's... We should...
We should call a resident.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.931
- We're not calling a resident.
- Sorry. I was just...

15:04.970 --> 15:07.905
- I'm really freaking out.
- I'm lying open on the table,

15:07.940 --> 15:11.774
and the last thing I need is panicking.
If you can't handle it, leave.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.381
Anybody else?

15:24.223 --> 15:26.384
Kelly clamps and 2-0 silk.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.253
Your dad around?
I need to check stitches.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.495
- He's still having tests.
- I'll come back.

15:35.534 --> 15:39.265
- Hey. How's that doctor my dad hit?
- She'll be OK.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.866
- Tell her I'm really sorry.
- Why? You didn't hit her.

15:42.908 --> 15:45.968
Yeah, it's just...

15:46.045 --> 15:48.536
...if I'd been able
to get my dad back to bed...

15:48.580 --> 15:53.313
- Sometimes I can talk him to sleep.
- This hasn't happened for a while?

15:53.352 --> 15:57.584
- Him sleepwalking?
- Yeah. Right.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.963
- When's the last time you slept?
- It's OK. I'm not that tired.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.762
Seriously, kid,
you should get some rest.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.799
So you diagnosed yourself?

16:15.708 --> 16:19.041
I ordered antibiotics online
to kill a staph infection.

16:19.078 --> 16:22.104
- Oh, my God!
- My husband dismissed as a pimple.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.810
- Along with your dermatologist.
- Who barely looked at it.

16:25.851 --> 16:30.254
OK? It was a staph infection, Seth.
It was. And it went away.

16:30.289 --> 16:34.055
- After I took the drugs, it went away.
- Pimples go away.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.653
You have C. diff.
It's not going away on its own.

16:36.695 --> 16:40.131
- Well, how do I treat it?
- You've basically killed

16:40.165 --> 16:44.795
all the healthy bacteria in your body
so we have to introduce new bacteria.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.603
- OK.
- By performing what's called a...

16:48.640 --> 16:51.575
- ...a fecal transplant.
- Poop?

16:52.578 --> 16:56.605
- I need a poop transplant?
- We'd feed a small tube up your nose

16:56.682 --> 17:00.482
and down into your stomach.
The donor needs to be someone

17:00.519 --> 17:06.219
who you share everyday germs with.
Typically, a spouse.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.523
- Admit it was a pimple.
- Seth.

17:10.561 --> 17:14.828
No. I'm not going to crap into a bowl
until you admit it was a pimple.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.325
That's the deal! When you're ready,
come and find me.

17:19.671 --> 17:23.607
- Come on, tell him it was a pimple.
- It was not a pimple!

17:25.144 --> 17:28.340
None of my interns are answering
pages. Did they go home...?

17:28.380 --> 17:32.544
- Hey! Where are the other morons?
- I don't know.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.348
I was just getting candy and...

17:35.387 --> 17:36.445
I don't know.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.855
- Clearly.
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.860
Hey!

17:44.730 --> 17:49.724
Give me your chocolate.
All of it. Give me that, too.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.435
- Where are the stooges?
- That moron is a moron,

17:58.477 --> 18:01.605
- and the others are AWOL.
- I need an intern to page me

18:01.647 --> 18:04.377
- if my guy craps.
- I wonder if they're in skills lab.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.941
- Sadie said something about it.
- In the hospital?

18:06.985 --> 18:10.079
Time in skills lab is paying off.
My interns are still idiots,

18:10.122 --> 18:13.319
but they're idiots
that can put in an IV.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.189
No, they're just idiots.

18:17.296 --> 18:22.495
- So what's going on with Izzie?
- I don't know what's wrong.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.832
I'm sick of people
not talking to each other.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.430
I'm gonna go get
my crap-chick some crap.

18:33.745 --> 18:34.803
Meredith?

18:37.583 --> 18:38.811
Do you have a sec?

18:43.822 --> 18:46.655
- Two! What are you doing?
- I'm only charting!

18:46.692 --> 18:51.925
- Well, where's Three and 4.2?
- I don't know? I thought...

18:51.964 --> 18:55.058
Stop. Come with me, you're doing
post-op orders on the appy.

18:55.100 --> 18:59.036
Tell me all about whatever trouble
your little friends are into.

19:01.907 --> 19:05.900
- Do you need a leash? Let's go!
- No.

19:13.018 --> 19:17.114
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean...

19:17.156 --> 19:20.683
...I kind of can't walk.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.490
Due to the catheter and the epidural.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.504
I can hear your heart beating.

19:37.809 --> 19:42.041
Which is odd because they took it out
for the autopsy.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.642
This isn't real, is it?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.085
This is real.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.455
Izzie, this is real.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.796
I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed

19:59.831 --> 20:03.858
because this is like that moment
in the morning when you first wake up

20:03.902 --> 20:07.360
and you're still half asleep.
And everything seems...

20:08.440 --> 20:11.273
Things are possible.
Dreams feel true.

20:11.310 --> 20:14.802
And for that one moment
between waking and sleeping,

20:14.846 --> 20:17.474
anything can be real.

20:18.250 --> 20:23.449
And then you open your eyes
and the sun hits you and you realize...

20:26.458 --> 20:28.585
I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.762
OK.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.863
OK.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.718
I think she's dying.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.886
- Her BP is dangerously low.
- We need to push two liters of LR.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.989
- Should we call a code?
- There is no code team in outpatient

21:07.032 --> 21:10.991
in the night because this would
be done by a surgeon in a regular OR.

21:11.036 --> 21:14.096
Page the chief, get Bailey.
Tell her there's an emergency.

21:14.139 --> 21:18.542
You're not to say anything else.
Take that crazy look off your face.

21:20.412 --> 21:25.281
How's Mr. Soltanoff? His night terrors
are happening more than he knows.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.443
The kid's exhausted.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.681
Scary going to bed at night
not knowing what you to wake up to.

21:29.721 --> 21:33.020
Sounds like living with Meredith.
She takes in strays.

21:34.593 --> 21:38.256
It's your fault. I never thought
about Little Grey in that way

21:38.297 --> 21:40.356
until you told me not to.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.866
Now, I can't help it.
You planted a seed.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.198
Unplant it.

21:46.571 --> 21:50.098
She wants to tell you something.

21:52.244 --> 21:56.442
I believe that you
believe it was a pimple.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.507
- Lauren...
- That's the best I can do.

21:59.551 --> 22:05.217
- I believe that you believe it...
- It was a pimple!

22:05.257 --> 22:08.818
- It was a staph infection!
- No poo! No poo for you!

22:08.860 --> 22:12.626
Wait! Dude, she could lie to you
and tell you what you want to hear,

22:12.664 --> 22:15.724
but she's not.
She's telling you what's real for her.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.735
Stop walking away.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.409
I still think this could be
stomach cancer.

22:27.446 --> 22:32.042
And when I get a headache,
I think it's a brain tumor.

22:32.117 --> 22:36.349
And I lay awake
and feel lumps in my breasts,

22:36.388 --> 22:39.687
and my heart starts to race
and I think I'm having a heart attack.

22:39.725 --> 22:43.525
So no, I don't think it was a pimple.

22:44.196 --> 22:48.656
The world is a scary place

22:48.700 --> 22:52.796
and there are a thousand things a day
that can kill you.

22:54.039 --> 22:57.202
And I don't see how you don't see it.

22:59.444 --> 23:02.538
Dr. Bailey, there's an emergency
in outpatient surgery.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.879
- What kind of emergency?
- There's a...

23:05.951 --> 23:10.081
It's an emergency. Please come?

23:13.024 --> 23:16.050
I'd like to do an EEG. There's
a chance night terrors are caused

23:16.094 --> 23:18.585
by epilepsy in the frontal lobe.

23:18.630 --> 23:22.225
I went through all that in the sleep
clinic. As long as I take my meds...

23:22.267 --> 23:25.930
We have reason to believe the problem
may be worse than you're aware.

23:25.971 --> 23:29.236
- I don't understand.
- How often does your dad sleepwalk?

23:29.307 --> 23:32.105
I sleep.
I just forgot my meds this time.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.736
No, you didn't.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.143
You took them while I was brushing
my teeth like you always do,

23:38.183 --> 23:40.879
and then you put me to bed
like you always do,

23:40.919 --> 23:44.446
and then you woke up screaming
like you always do.

23:44.489 --> 23:48.892
I try to stay awake because usually
I can talk you back to bed.

23:48.927 --> 23:53.125
But tonight, I must have fallen asleep.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.362
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You said these bad dreams

23:56.435 --> 23:59.700
were caused by stress,
and I'm your stress.

23:59.805 --> 24:02.239
You take such good care of me
during the day,

24:02.307 --> 24:05.037
the least I could do
was take care of you at night.

24:05.076 --> 24:09.172
We're saying the nightmares were
caused by epilepsy, not the stress.

24:09.214 --> 24:13.310
If the test confirms epilepsy, you
understand what that would mean?

24:14.820 --> 24:17.789
- This wasn't my fault?
- That it wasn't your fault.

24:19.157 --> 24:21.022
Dad...

24:24.162 --> 24:26.153
Let's get the EEG.

24:27.599 --> 24:28.998
Sweetheart.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.666
Denny?

24:39.144 --> 24:40.304
Denny?

24:41.513 --> 24:42.844
Denny!

24:43.748 --> 24:46.876
- Denny! Denny!
- What's all the yelling about?

24:46.918 --> 24:50.684
You can't do that! You can't disappear!
I thought you were gone!

24:50.722 --> 24:52.952
- I was just...
- I thought you left me again!

24:55.293 --> 24:58.490
- I told you, I'm here for you.
- No, you're not. You died.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.829
You died and you left me here!
I was left here by myself!

25:01.900 --> 25:05.836
- You left me all alone!
- You're not alone anymore.

25:05.871 --> 25:09.705
Why? Why did you come back?
I had moved on! I got over you!

25:09.741 --> 25:12.676
I have a life and a job and a boyfriend!

25:12.777 --> 25:15.507
And now you're back
and I'm in this room all day,

25:15.547 --> 25:18.516
probably talking to myself!
I'm probably going crazy!

25:18.550 --> 25:22.247
There is a real world out there
and I'm stuck in here with you!

25:22.287 --> 25:26.246
- I'm sorry I died.
- No! No! Screw you!

25:26.291 --> 25:29.818
You don't get to apologize for dying!

25:29.861 --> 25:32.591
You don't get to apologize
because I killed you!

25:32.631 --> 25:36.658
I convinced you to let me cut
the LVAD and I killed you!

25:36.701 --> 25:39.363
So you don't get
to apologize for dying!

25:39.404 --> 25:42.066
- Dead people don't apologize!
- Izzie.

25:42.107 --> 25:45.167
Just shut up! Shut up!

26:07.499 --> 26:09.023
I love you.

26:13.204 --> 26:14.933
I love you, too.

26:17.676 --> 26:21.237
- What the hell is going on?
- Trying to take out her appendix.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.646
- Whose foolish idea was that?
- Mine.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.284
- Where are we?
- Found the artery in meso-appendix.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.449
- The stitches the interns did came off.
- Hand me a 3-0 silk.

26:32.490 --> 26:34.856
I need more suction.
How's her pressure?

26:34.960 --> 26:38.327
- 74 systolic.
- She's really bleeding. I can't see.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.127
The stump isn't closed.
She needs a cecectomy.

26:41.166 --> 26:44.658
- I can't get to the appendiceal artery.
- You can. You almost had it.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.829
Here.

26:46.738 --> 26:50.071
- Is your visualization better?
- I can't see anything!

26:50.108 --> 26:52.599
Don't panic. Put that down.

26:52.644 --> 26:57.877
Feel down for the meso-appendix.
Find the pulsation.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.750
Now follow it to the end.

27:02.087 --> 27:06.990
- It feels... I think I've got it.
- Good. Now, place your clamp.

27:08.259 --> 27:13.322
OK. That's right. Grey, tie it off
while Yang holds the clamp in place.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.992
- Stick-tie or ligature suture?
- Whatever works.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.025
You have to do what feels right to you.

27:19.204 --> 27:20.501
Ligature suture.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.979
- Are we gonna go to jail?
- You're not gonna go to jail.

27:38.023 --> 27:43.017
You didn't have the balls to stay.
The rest of us are gonna go to jail.

27:45.697 --> 27:47.358
I just heard.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.333
What the hell happened?

27:49.401 --> 27:52.131
We live together.
You should have come to me.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.970
- So what? You could have saved me?
- Maybe I could have stopped you.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.373
This isn't about you.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.277
This is the one thing I've done
in the past few months

28:01.312 --> 28:05.271
that wasn't about getting you
to notice me. I did this.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.808
You had nothing to do with it.
This was all me.

28:11.322 --> 28:17.022
Dude, she's like in love with you.
How did you miss that?

28:39.851 --> 28:42.979
- It's 911. I have to go.
- OK. So go.

28:46.357 --> 28:50.088
Is this the part where you go back
to heaven or wherever

28:50.128 --> 28:53.723
and you and your dead guy friends
talk about how great it was

28:53.765 --> 28:56.427
that you gave me
this last night together?

28:56.468 --> 29:00.063
That I needed it to grieve
and move on?

29:00.105 --> 29:02.938
Me and my dead guy friends
mostly talk about sports.

29:02.974 --> 29:06.774
- Denny...
- Izzie, go.

29:06.811 --> 29:09.177
I'm not going anywhere.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.088
We're just about ready.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.289
- I'm sorry, honey, for all my crazy.
- Don't be sorry.

29:24.329 --> 29:28.732
I love you, even crazy. OK.
I've taken your crap all these years.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.032
It's finally time for you
to take mine.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.004
I'm here for my wife,
but it's better for our sex life

29:35.039 --> 29:39.100
if I don't see this, so I'll be here
for her down in the lobby.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.379
No more spikes.
We've eliminated seizure area.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.252
He can finally get
a decent night's sleep.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.522
- How did he not know this happened?
- Why is it his fault for not noticing?

29:56.561 --> 29:59.189
Going through life thinking
they had the relationship

29:59.230 --> 30:01.824
where she could talk to him
if she was in trouble.

30:01.866 --> 30:05.700
If you really have feelings for
someone, if you really love them,

30:05.737 --> 30:09.639
- then you talk to them.
- Maybe she tried.

30:09.674 --> 30:12.040
We don't know what went on
between them.

30:12.110 --> 30:17.275
Maybe words failed her.
Sometimes, words fail.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.989
Your dad won't be out of surgery
for at least another hour.

30:28.026 --> 30:31.257
You could have a little nap.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.730
You're 13?
You're hitting the hard stuff?

30:33.765 --> 30:36.097
I like the taste.

30:38.703 --> 30:42.969
I was raised by parents who weren't
very interested in having kids.

30:43.007 --> 30:47.944
They had friends, they had lives.
They weren't around much at night.

30:47.979 --> 30:51.676
Before I went to bed,
I would turn on all the TVs,

30:51.716 --> 30:55.743
every light in the house,
even in the closets.

30:55.787 --> 30:59.052
Still couldn't sleep.

31:02.560 --> 31:07.190
It's hard to sleep when you don't
feel safe in your own house, isn't it?

31:07.232 --> 31:09.097
Yeah.

31:10.568 --> 31:14.527
Give me that.
You are going to sleep.

31:14.572 --> 31:18.565
- No.
- I'm not taking no for an answer.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.579
Close your eyes. I'll be here.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.843
Go on.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.474
Close your eyes.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.408
Close your eyes.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.791
I was sleeping.

31:37.829 --> 31:42.129
And sleep isn't easy for me to
come by, but I was finally sleeping.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.600
- Then I get a call.
- I can't believe it.

31:44.636 --> 31:48.037
- I still can't believe it.
- Don't beat yourself up about it.

31:48.072 --> 31:51.530
I've seen a lot of maturity
in you through this whole mess.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.773
You handled the crisis,
you handled the surgery.

31:54.812 --> 31:57.042
You saved that girl's life.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.448
And you called for help right away.

32:00.485 --> 32:04.478
There was a time you would
have reached a different conclusion.

32:04.522 --> 32:07.047
You could've stuck to the code
and saved your own.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.490
Tried to hide the mess.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.620
Sometimes protecting
colleagues is solidarity,

32:11.663 --> 32:14.223
and sometimes it's just hubris.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.199
I'm glad to see you
know the difference.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.162
Chief... I can't let you get in trouble.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.933
- Lexie...
- It's not right.

32:22.006 --> 32:25.100
People tried to stop me.
Dr. Yang told me to shut it down,

32:25.143 --> 32:28.476
- but I didn't listen.
- You knew about this yesterday?

32:28.513 --> 32:30.947
- Did you know?
- No.

32:30.982 --> 32:33.473
- You knew.
- No!

32:33.518 --> 32:36.578
You knew they were gonna cut her?
Lexie just said you knew!

32:36.621 --> 32:40.557
I knew they were doing sutures.
I didn't think I needed to say anything

32:40.591 --> 32:43.424
- because I shut it down.
- Apparently, you didn't.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.760
Almost cost Lexie her job,
not to mention Sadie almost died!

32:46.798 --> 32:48.231
Sadie did that to herself,

32:48.266 --> 32:51.235
and let's not pretend you have
a relationship with Lexie.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.067
- Let's not pretend you care.
- I care about my job!

32:54.105 --> 32:56.699
- I care about doing right!
- Who are you to lecture

32:56.741 --> 33:00.472
on doing right? Are you kidding me?
You're not an attending.

33:00.511 --> 33:03.674
- You may be sleeping with one.
- Is that was this is about?

33:03.748 --> 33:07.275
- It's always gonna be about Derek?
- Fine, it's about you and me

33:07.318 --> 33:11.049
- and that you didn't have my back.
- What did you want me to say?

33:11.089 --> 33:13.319
Anything!
You should have said anything!

33:13.358 --> 33:17.692
You have a relationship with the chief,
have his ear, you didn't say anything

33:17.729 --> 33:22.291
to defend me.
Because this isn't just on me.

33:22.333 --> 33:26.235
You stood there and watched him take
me out of the running for solo surgery.

33:26.270 --> 33:30.764
You let me take the blame.
We all had interns in that room.

33:30.808 --> 33:35.074
We all failed to supervise them.
And if your friend had died in there,

33:35.113 --> 33:38.571
if you and I hadn't saved her life,
that would have been on all of us.

33:38.616 --> 33:40.015
You should have said that.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.367
- Why are you looking at me?
- We were wondering...

33:58.403 --> 34:01.167
- The interns...
- What you're gonna say to them.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.335
Uh-uh. No. No. I am tired. I'm not
saying anything to the interns.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.640
I raised my babies.
You were my babies.

34:07.712 --> 34:11.670
You all are grown. This is on you.
You raise your own babies.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.844
- So we have to talk to them?
- Your babies.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.481
- What do we say?
- Do you need a speech from me?

34:18.523 --> 34:22.152
At this point? After this time?
If you do, you shouldn't be here.

34:22.193 --> 34:26.562
If you do, I haven't raised you right.
And I know I raised you right.

34:26.597 --> 34:31.933
No. You don't get a speech from me.
It's time to make your own speeches.

34:44.916 --> 34:49.080
- Dr. Grey, present.
- Sadie Harris, 30,

34:49.120 --> 34:52.556
three hours post appendectomy
complicated by hemorrhaging.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.525
- Death, what is this?
- Dr. Spalding.

34:55.560 --> 35:00.588
Vitals stable, antibiotic coverage.
She should recover within two weeks.

35:01.833 --> 35:06.964
- And?
- And we, your surgeons,

35:07.004 --> 35:09.905
made mistakes
that compromised your care.

35:09.941 --> 35:14.469
Mistakes that reflect poorly on this
hospital and that won't happen again.

35:14.512 --> 35:17.606
Effective immediately,
every intern here is on probation.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.947
So much as sneeze,
and you're done.

35:21.853 --> 35:25.186
None of you will see the inside
of an OR until further notice.

35:25.223 --> 35:29.990
You've lost the chief's respect, which
believe me, is not an easy thing to get.

35:30.027 --> 35:34.555
Speaking for myself, you've lost
my respect and won't get that back.

35:34.599 --> 35:37.932
- But he still respects Izzie Stevens.
- What did you say?

35:37.969 --> 35:41.336
You still seem to respect Izzie Stevens
and she killed a patient.

35:42.807 --> 35:46.436
She was trying to save a man's life.
You almost killed a friend for fun.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.103
It's different.

35:58.322 --> 36:03.453
- How're you doing?
- They give good drugs here.

36:04.395 --> 36:06.955
- Do I look bad?
- You look beautiful.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.489
Badge of honor all over your face.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.299
Hey. Did I hear correctly?

36:17.341 --> 36:23.041
- That the interns went scalpel-crazy?
- Yes, you did.

36:24.982 --> 36:29.248
- Crazy.
- I don't know that they were. Crazy.

36:29.287 --> 36:32.552
I can remember what it's like
being an intern.

36:32.590 --> 36:36.856
Loving medicine.
Being so excited by surgery,

36:36.894 --> 36:41.422
wanted to operate so badly
that I'd do anything.

36:41.465 --> 36:46.425
That I couldn't stop bouncing up and
down long enough to hold a scalpel.

36:46.504 --> 36:48.131
Now...

36:50.107 --> 36:51.597
Now?

36:55.379 --> 36:59.145
I can do most of my surgeries
without even thinking about it.

36:59.217 --> 37:05.053
Like I'm driving. Suddenly, I'm home.
I don't even know how I got there.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.455
It's rote.

37:07.525 --> 37:13.464
I don't even remember most surgeries.
Most of the lives I save.

37:13.497 --> 37:17.365
And the residents, they work so hard,

37:17.401 --> 37:22.896
working like crazy to get to do a solo
surgery that I have come to hate.

37:22.940 --> 37:27.434
I hate appys. Appys bore me.

37:27.478 --> 37:32.074
I resent the appendix for bothering
to get hot and needing to come out.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.516
I resent an organ.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.554
I don't know.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.285
Maybe I don't want to do
general surgery after all.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.590
Maybe I need a new challenge.
Maybe I need something to make me

37:44.629 --> 37:49.293
bounce up and down.
Maybe I'm just tired.

37:50.901 --> 37:55.565
- It's OK... to be tired.
- Hmm.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.004
Right?

38:00.211 --> 38:04.170
- You're tired, too.
- I'm exhausted.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.643
Deep down inside exhausted.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.580
I just... I want...

38:14.625 --> 38:16.650
I don't know.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.922
But I want something.

38:21.632 --> 38:24.032
Well, that makes two of us.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.407
<i>Sleep. It's the easiest thing to do.</i>

38:31.442 --> 38:32.966
<i>You just...</i>

38:34.245 --> 38:36.975
<i>...close your eyes.</i>

38:42.486 --> 38:46.286
OK, fine. The surgery was a bad idea.

38:46.324 --> 38:51.261
No, it was a terrible idea. Speaking
as your boss, it was an irresponsible

38:51.329 --> 38:54.298
and reckless idea that
makes me question if you have

38:54.332 --> 38:56.732
- what it takes to be a good doctor.
- Death...

38:56.801 --> 38:58.632
As your friend...

39:00.338 --> 39:02.306
...what the hell is going on with you?

39:05.943 --> 39:08.070
I don't know.

39:08.112 --> 39:10.774
<i>But for so many of us,</i>

39:10.848 --> 39:13.578
<i>sleep seems out of our grasp.</i>

39:17.521 --> 39:19.045
Thank you.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.524
Your mom used to see
how tired I was.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.655
She used to make you bring me home
'cause I was alone and needed family.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.725
That was a good thing.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.030
So either you bring her home or I will.

39:38.175 --> 39:42.236
<i>We want it,</i>
<i>but we don't know how to get it.</i>

39:51.422 --> 39:53.253
I don't know why I came here.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.588
- Do you want to come in?
- No.

40:01.632 --> 40:04.692
I don't think that would be appropriate.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.038
Do you want to go someplace else?

40:11.809 --> 40:13.242
No.

40:31.462 --> 40:32.986
I think you're beautiful.

40:38.002 --> 40:42.371
<i>But once we face our demons,</i>
<i>face our fears...</i>

40:51.882 --> 40:54.749
- Hey. Lexie's here.
- Hey.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.686
- Yeah.
- Are you making up a bed for her?

40:57.721 --> 41:02.181
- Yeah.
- You brought home a stray.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.818
Yeah.

41:04.795 --> 41:08.959
- <i>...and turn to each other for help.</i>
- I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.763
I gotta be back at the hospital
in six hours.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.739
Alex, wait...

41:17.608 --> 41:19.599
I'm a mess.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.510
I'm a flat-out freaking mess.
I know that. I know.

41:22.546 --> 41:25.982
And I'm sorry.

41:26.016 --> 41:29.144
- You deserve a lot...
- Stop.

41:29.186 --> 41:34.089
If you don't want to be with me,
if this is too much for you now,

41:34.124 --> 41:36.422
it's OK.

41:36.460 --> 41:39.952
But you're gonna have to break up
with me. I'm not going anywhere.

41:39.997 --> 41:44.161
I can handle the mess.
So it's up to you.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.501
You coming?

42:01.952 --> 42:03.351
I'm sorry.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.786
I can't...

42:06.590 --> 42:08.956
It's OK.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.756
I will be right here.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.592
It's OK.

42:13.631 --> 42:16.862
<i>Night-time isn't so scary because...</i>

42:19.069 --> 42:22.129
<i>...we realize we aren't</i>
<i>all alone in the dark.</i>
