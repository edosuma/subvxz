Hedgehog!
Wake up buddy.

00:50.014 --> 00:53.007
It's Yeti Confetti morning!

00:53.009 --> 00:54.018
What's that?

00:54.020 --> 00:56.019
It was last month?

00:56.021 --> 00:58.023
Oh, today is Holly Harvest.

00:59.001 --> 01:01.009
The day where we decorate
our abodes with fresh holly

01:01.011 --> 01:02.023
and eat mince pies,
your favorite food

01:03.001 --> 01:05.015
in the whole world.

01:05.017 --> 01:09.003
Oh, your <i>absolute</i> <i>favorite food</i>
in the whole world.

01:09.005 --> 01:11.007
Anyway,
seeing as it's a holiday,

01:11.009 --> 01:12.022
I'm heading back to bed.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.003
No!

01:14.005 --> 01:16.006
Mince pies! Now!

01:29.004 --> 01:31.007
Shoot.
I'm sorry.

01:31.009 --> 01:33.004
I didn't mean
to make you so cold.

01:33.006 --> 01:37.000
Oh, well, thanks,
but that wasn't a shiver.

01:37.002 --> 01:38.005
It was a jitter.

01:38.007 --> 01:40.004
Isn't that
the same thing?

01:40.006 --> 01:42.008
No, a shiver
is when you are cold.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.010
A jitter is
when you are scared.

01:44.012 --> 01:46.007
Who's scared
of a little snow?

01:46.009 --> 01:48.020
No. No, I...

01:48.022 --> 01:51.000
Every year,
I sneak into the kitchen

01:51.002 --> 01:52.022
to shave a little
off the wheel.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.014
You mean
the cheese wheel?

01:54.016 --> 01:56.022
Yep.
Y'know, for my kids.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.002
Of course.

01:58.004 --> 01:59.007
But this year,

01:59.009 --> 02:01.016
my kids gave me
this pair of heels.

02:01.018 --> 02:03.003
Thought I'd like 'em.

02:03.005 --> 02:04.020
Turns out,
I don't like 'em.

02:04.022 --> 02:06.017
I <i>love</i> <i>'em.</i>

02:06.019 --> 02:07.022
Can't take 'em off.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.008
Partly 'cause I love 'em,

02:09.010 --> 02:11.018
partly cause my kids
glued them to my feet

02:11.020 --> 02:13.016
as a joke.
Gotcha.

02:13.018 --> 02:16.010
I can't go click-clacking around
in these things today.

02:16.012 --> 02:18.017
If those chefs hear me comin'
they're gonna hit me

02:18.019 --> 02:20.011
with a textbook
slice-and-dice,

02:20.013 --> 02:22.007
and then serve me
to the roaches.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.014
Hmm.

02:23.016 --> 02:25.021
I've got it!
I know what to do.

02:25.023 --> 02:27.004
I'll go in there with you

02:27.006 --> 02:28.022
and deaden the sound
of your heels.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.021
Haven't you ever noticed
how quiet it is

02:30.023 --> 02:31.022
when it's snowing?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.009
That's what
snowflakes do!

02:33.011 --> 02:34.022
It's actual science.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.021
Here.

02:35.023 --> 02:37.001
Try it for yourself.

02:38.012 --> 02:40.009
That's incredible!
Yeah!

02:40.011 --> 02:42.005
Now try it over there.

02:45.003 --> 02:46.021
Yeesh.
What a racket.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.005
Yeah, it works better
if you're closer.

02:49.007 --> 02:51.003
Sound waves or something.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.014
Man,
I can't believe this.

02:53.016 --> 02:55.009
This is a miracle.

02:55.011 --> 02:57.015
except...wh--
what about you?

02:57.017 --> 02:59.022
Wouldn't you rather be doing
snowflakey things

03:00.000 --> 03:01.014
with your
snowflake friends?

03:01.016 --> 03:04.003
What? No!
No way.

03:04.005 --> 03:05.008
I hate snowflakes.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.011
You know how
they always say

03:06.013 --> 03:08.004
every snowflake
is different?

03:08.006 --> 03:10.010
Well, news flash,
we're not.

03:10.012 --> 03:12.009
They just say that
to make us feel better.

03:12.011 --> 03:13.022
But we're all
the same.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.018
We're born, we fall through
the crummy old air,

03:16.020 --> 03:18.018
and we land
in a crummy old pile.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.002
And that's about it.

03:20.004 --> 03:22.006
I wanna try
something different.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.014
I mean,
we're all gonna melt anyway.

03:24.016 --> 03:26.002
I wanna go
to new places,

03:26.004 --> 03:28.005
see new things,
meet new people.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.005
Yeah, I get that.
When you're a mouse,

03:30.007 --> 03:32.003
everyone's always
tryin' to give you

03:32.005 --> 03:34.007
the textbook
slice-and-dice.

03:34.009 --> 03:36.010
It's hard to make
new fr-- uh...

03:36.012 --> 03:38.001
meet new people.

03:38.003 --> 03:40.009
Um, I'm Cookiesmell,
by the way.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.011
Snowflake.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.003
Nice to meet you.

03:46.001 --> 03:47.001
Wow.

03:47.003 --> 03:48.020
It's like a cathedral.

03:48.022 --> 03:50.011
Only on holidays.

03:50.013 --> 03:52.011
Normally,
it's utter chaos.

03:52.013 --> 03:55.008
A nightmarish,
carnival of insanity and...

03:57.017 --> 03:59.009
Snowflake!

03:59.011 --> 04:03.016
Snowflake?

04:10.008 --> 04:12.008
Yah!
Whoa!

04:13.018 --> 04:15.022
I thought you said
this was gonna be dangerous!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.008
Oh, it will be.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.015
Like, right about...

04:18.017 --> 04:20.023
now!

04:25.003 --> 04:28.016
Okay, it actually
really is dangerous now, so...

04:28.018 --> 04:29.014
Oh, sorry.

04:29.016 --> 04:31.013
Here,
peek around this corner

04:31.015 --> 04:33.020
and tell me if you
can see where the cheese is,

04:33.022 --> 04:36.018
and if there are any chefs
looking to catch me

04:36.020 --> 04:38.018
with a textbook
slice-and-dice.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.004
The cheese is right
on the counter,

04:40.006 --> 04:42.014
and I see two chefs
looking to do that.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.020
Rats!
Okay.

04:43.022 --> 04:47.012
This time, lemme know
when the coast is clear.

04:47.014 --> 04:51.003
It's clear! Go!

04:51.005 --> 04:54.013
Hurry!

04:54.015 --> 04:56.014
Oh, no.
We're trapped.

04:56.016 --> 04:58.006
Wait.
I've got an idea.

04:58.008 --> 05:01.002
I saw this in a movie
once...

05:01.004 --> 05:02.017
in a dream.

05:28.021 --> 05:29.020
Whoa!

05:29.022 --> 05:33.001
Oh! Oh!

05:36.023 --> 05:40.007
Who-o-o-oa!

05:43.005 --> 05:46.011
Well...
that coulda been worse,

05:46.013 --> 05:49.003
but we've still got
big problems.

05:49.005 --> 05:50.005
See?

05:50.007 --> 05:51.010
The cheese is
1,000 feet away

05:51.012 --> 05:53.011
on the other side
of that canyon.

05:53.013 --> 05:54.022
Look!
Huh?

05:57.006 --> 05:58.015
The doorknob!

05:58.017 --> 05:59.020
Ah, geez.

05:59.022 --> 06:01.016
Hurry!

06:05.004 --> 06:06.018
That's it!

06:06.020 --> 06:08.000
We're so close.

06:08.002 --> 06:09.012
Woo-hoo!

06:09.014 --> 06:11.019
Gimme! Gimme!

06:11.021 --> 06:13.020
Aaah!

06:15.015 --> 06:17.015
Holy cow.

06:17.017 --> 06:19.006
Are you okay?

06:19.008 --> 06:23.003
Yeah,
but my foot is stuck.

06:23.005 --> 06:24.011
Hold on.

06:24.013 --> 06:27.005
I'll go see if I can find
something to pry it out with.

06:27.007 --> 06:28.013
Ah!

06:36.017 --> 06:38.007
Hang tight, Cookiesmell.

06:38.009 --> 06:40.008
This'll just take a sec.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.019
Olive oil?

06:44.021 --> 06:47.010
Y'know, I appreciate
the thought, Snowflake,

06:47.012 --> 06:50.003
but drinking gallons
and gallons of olive oil

06:50.005 --> 06:52.006
so that my feet
get bigger and bigger

06:52.008 --> 06:54.005
until finally these shoes
get blasted off my feet

06:54.007 --> 06:57.019
like a rocket
is gonna take days.

06:57.021 --> 06:59.005
Oh!

06:59.007 --> 07:01.008
Oh, okay.
Now I get it.

07:03.010 --> 07:05.020
Look at the size
of this shaving.

07:05.022 --> 07:07.021
Snowflake?

07:11.022 --> 07:13.015
Yah!

07:37.006 --> 07:38.010
Whoops.

07:38.012 --> 07:40.009
'Scuse me, buddy.

07:40.011 --> 07:41.009
Aaah!

07:41.011 --> 07:43.007
Che-- Che-- Che--

07:43.009 --> 07:44.012
Chef!

07:44.014 --> 07:46.015
Oh, hey, Cookiesmell.

07:46.017 --> 07:47.021
Oscar?

07:47.023 --> 07:50.013
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

07:50.015 --> 07:52.013
Hedgehog,
Cookiesmell is here.

07:52.015 --> 07:54.009
Who?
You remember.

07:54.011 --> 07:56.009
The mouse
who lives in my wall.

07:56.011 --> 07:58.001
You mean <i>my</i> <i>wall.</i>

07:58.003 --> 07:59.012
Oh yeah. Hm.

07:59.014 --> 08:01.019
What brings you to
the Mess Hall, Cookiesmell?

08:01.021 --> 08:03.003
Ha!

08:03.005 --> 08:05.016
I was just about to ask you
the same question.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.004
Oh, yeah.

08:07.006 --> 08:08.017
We were just borrowing
the kitchen for the day

08:08.019 --> 08:10.017
to cook
our Holly Harvest feast.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.021
Hedgehog is
a mince pie fiend.

08:12.023 --> 08:14.012
Mince pies!
Where?

08:14.014 --> 08:16.015
Ah.
Okay.

08:16.017 --> 08:19.004
I was in here just shavin'
a little off the wheel,

08:19.006 --> 08:20.015
and then, man...

08:20.017 --> 08:22.010
I-I thought one of those chefs
was about to hit me

08:22.012 --> 08:24.007
with a textbook
slice-and-dice.

08:24.009 --> 08:27.010
Gee whiz.
Mouse life sure is tough, huh?

08:27.012 --> 08:29.018
Yeah.
No kiddin'.

08:31.020 --> 08:33.021
Anyway,
is there any chance

08:33.023 --> 08:35.015
you guys could give me
a lift back home?

08:35.017 --> 08:38.013
My feet are killin' me
and, well...

08:38.015 --> 08:40.022
I'm feelin' a little
heavy hearted.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.015
Oh, shoot.
Yeah!

08:42.017 --> 08:43.018
Of course.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.002
It's no trouble
at all.

08:45.004 --> 08:46.012
Yeah, absolutely.

08:46.014 --> 08:48.008
We were just
wrapping up in here.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.004
Yeah, just give us
five more minutes.

08:50.006 --> 08:52.020
Uh, six more minutes.

08:52.022 --> 08:54.017
No rush.

08:56.004 --> 08:59.007
So, tell me more about
this heavy heart, Cookiesmell.

08:59.009 --> 09:02.005
Yeah,
what's got you down?

09:02.007 --> 09:05.011
Well, it's
my friend Snowflake.

09:05.013 --> 09:08.003
She, um -- She melted.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.014
Oh.
Oh, no.

09:09.016 --> 09:13.016
Yeah, and, well,
I guess I never got to...

09:13.018 --> 09:15.017
say goodbye.

09:15.019 --> 09:18.018
Oh, Cookiesmell,
Snowflake's not gone.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.010
She just evaporated.

09:20.012 --> 09:23.012
She's up in the atmosphere now.
And soon she'll be snow again.

09:23.014 --> 09:25.017
Really?
For sure.

09:25.019 --> 09:28.015
Sometimes snowflakes just need
to try out a new look.

09:28.017 --> 09:31.012
To keep their style fresh.

09:31.014 --> 09:33.011
I get that.

09:33.013 --> 09:35.017
Bye, Cookiesmell.
Take care!

09:35.019 --> 09:38.004
Bye, Oscar.
Bye, Hedgehog.

09:38.006 --> 09:40.001
Thanks again
for everything.

09:40.003 --> 09:43.003
I'll see you again soon.

09:47.018 --> 09:48.023
Hello, my beautiful --

09:49.001 --> 09:50.004
Cheese!

09:50.006 --> 09:51.016
Gah. Hold on a second.

09:51.018 --> 09:53.016
Cheese!
There's plenty for everybody!

09:56.006 --> 09:58.004
Tell us about
your adventure, Dad.

09:58.006 --> 10:01.010
Yeah, what kind of nerdy
