00:00.001 --> 00:01.710
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:01.713 --> 00:02.914
Good job out there.

00:02.917 --> 00:04.085
Are you sticking around?

00:04.088 --> 00:05.742
Wally, ready to leave?

00:05.744 --> 00:07.070
I'm actually gonna stay.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.752
The hunt for the six totems has begun.

00:08.755 --> 00:09.754
No.

00:09.757 --> 00:11.609
We'll fix this. We'll get your totem back.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.367
Nora was possessed by Mallus.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.589
He seemed scared of my totem.

00:15.592 --> 00:17.187
You're one of the six.

00:17.189 --> 00:19.222
The good news is we
already have the air,

00:19.224 --> 00:20.457
earth, and fire.

00:20.459 --> 00:22.326
And Kuasa has the water totem.

00:22.328 --> 00:24.468
Which leaves us with the final totem,

00:24.471 --> 00:26.262
which is still a complete mystery.

00:26.265 --> 00:28.632
Good point. Way to go, Ray.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.213
Hello, sir.

00:43.215 --> 00:46.617
Um, I've been saving up for a while now,

00:46.619 --> 00:48.819
and I think it's time.

00:48.821 --> 00:50.354
I'm here to buy a guitar.

00:50.356 --> 00:52.028
Now, I know it ain't much.

00:52.031 --> 00:55.392
But what do you think I
can get for what I got?

00:55.394 --> 00:59.229
Well, I'm sure we could
find you something.

00:59.231 --> 01:01.264
You know, a boy picking his first guitar

01:01.266 --> 01:02.966
is a sacred moment.

01:02.968 --> 01:05.501
In fact, some say

01:05.504 --> 01:08.137
the instrument chooses you.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.077
Hmm.

01:16.081 --> 01:17.114
I'll take that one.

01:17.116 --> 01:18.348
Oh.

01:19.385 --> 01:21.018
You don't want that guitar.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.989
What happened to the
instrument choosing me, sir?

01:22.992 --> 01:25.656
I was just, uh, building a moment.

01:25.658 --> 01:28.191
Besides, you can't afford it.

01:28.193 --> 01:30.020
Well, I'll get the
money. I'll come back.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.628
Look, I gotta tell you the truth.

01:33.165 --> 01:35.262
Before that guitar found its way here,

01:35.265 --> 01:38.137
it belonged to a one Robert Johnson.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.968
- The Robert Johnson?
- Uh-huh.

01:39.971 --> 01:41.676
Legend said he sold
his soul to the devil

01:41.679 --> 01:42.765
to play as good as he did.

01:42.768 --> 01:44.653
Legend also says that guitar is cursed

01:44.656 --> 01:47.070
- because of it.
- I ain't afraid of no guitar, sir.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.975
You gotta let me try it, at least.

02:02.094 --> 02:04.387
They must be messing with
the power lines outside.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.221
Sound like that, how could it be cursed?

02:31.223 --> 02:33.676
You know what? The guitar's yours.

02:33.679 --> 02:35.859
You just take it away from here.

02:35.861 --> 02:38.047
Thank you, sir. Much... much obliged.

02:39.276 --> 02:40.754
An instrument as good as this,

02:40.757 --> 02:43.734
I promise, one day you'll
hear my name on that radio.

02:45.304 --> 02:49.473
Hey, what is your name, son?

02:49.475 --> 02:50.606
Presley, sir.

02:50.609 --> 02:51.942
Elvis Presley.

02:57.515 --> 03:02.567

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

03:02.570 --> 03:04.397
Which brings us to the kitchen.

03:04.399 --> 03:07.367
We divvy up cleaning
duties by Ray's chore wheel,

03:07.369 --> 03:10.169
which uses a complex system
I pretend to not understand

03:10.171 --> 03:12.205
until he eventually
does my chores for me.

03:12.207 --> 03:14.273
"Wipe down food fabricator."

03:14.276 --> 03:16.906
Bet you thought time travel
would be seeing Woodstock,

03:16.909 --> 03:18.976
saving Shakespeare, and
having ethical debates

03:18.979 --> 03:20.746
while standing over baby Hitler.

03:20.749 --> 03:23.049
Trust me, it takes time
to get used to life...

03:24.152 --> 03:26.023
Cool, so what's next?

03:26.026 --> 03:27.887
It's gonna get time for me to get used

03:27.889 --> 03:30.723
to life with a speedster.

03:30.725 --> 03:33.492
This is my room.

03:33.495 --> 03:36.429
Guess you and me are bunkmates
while we help move you

03:36.432 --> 03:37.630
into Stein's quarters.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.548
You just moved yourself in, didn't you?

03:42.550 --> 03:44.316
I figured, why bother anyone else?

03:44.318 --> 03:46.285
You know, I was gonna invite
you to be my player two,

03:46.287 --> 03:48.362
but you're officially
not my problem anymore.

03:49.601 --> 03:51.690
Wait, who beat all my high scores?

03:51.692 --> 03:53.058
Well, you see, the
thing with "Ms. Pac-Man"

03:53.060 --> 03:54.627
is you gotta just ignore the fruit.

03:54.629 --> 03:56.495
All the points come from
taking down the ghosts.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.697
Yeah, I know that, but nobody could beat

03:58.699 --> 04:00.065
these scores without...

04:01.088 --> 04:03.021
Without lightning-fast fingers.

04:03.024 --> 04:05.157
You better not have
messed with "Guitar Hero."

04:07.041 --> 04:08.340
What's "Trombone Hero?"

04:12.113 --> 04:14.312
Hold on, Axl. Sammy's coming.

04:14.315 --> 04:17.449
Just gotta find the damn mayo.

04:18.786 --> 04:20.351
Come on, Mick.

04:20.353 --> 04:22.520
What did I say about
having him in the kitchen?

04:22.523 --> 04:24.290
- Not to.
- Yes.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.358
Would you toss me the walnuts, please?

04:26.360 --> 04:27.760
Thank you.

04:27.762 --> 04:29.261
I'm gonna need some brain food

04:29.263 --> 04:30.863
if I'm gonna fix the fire totem.

04:30.865 --> 04:33.441
You know, Nora thought using
cold fusion to reboot it

04:33.444 --> 04:34.766
was a crazy idea, but...

04:34.769 --> 04:36.001
Don't care.

04:36.003 --> 04:38.270
Where's the mayo?

04:38.272 --> 04:40.906
The new kid. The new kid!

04:40.908 --> 04:44.109
I saw him speed-moving in
to Marty's old quarters.

04:44.111 --> 04:47.039
Too much change on this damn ship.

04:47.042 --> 04:49.309
That's what I love about old Axl.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.582
Doesn't change.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.553
Josh Groban?

04:54.555 --> 04:57.289
Who the hell's Josh Groban?

04:57.291 --> 05:00.117
And who the hell changed
the name of my rat?

05:00.120 --> 05:01.755
All right, kids, it's
anachronism o'clock.

05:01.757 --> 05:02.723
What you got?

05:02.726 --> 05:03.835
How about this one?

05:03.838 --> 05:07.099
It's a category two during
the Belle Epoque in Paris.

05:07.101 --> 05:08.500
- Sounds romantic.
- Hmm.

05:08.502 --> 05:10.369
Or, um, this category three,

05:10.371 --> 05:13.439
which is the launch of
the Spirit of St. Louis.

05:13.441 --> 05:15.307
I always wanted to
join the mile-high club.

05:15.309 --> 05:17.009
It's when two people on a plane...

05:17.011 --> 05:19.078
Hey, really cute that you
guys are crazy in love,

05:19.080 --> 05:21.413
but date night is going to have to wait.

05:21.415 --> 05:24.083
If these anachronisms are
loosening Mallus' cage,

05:24.085 --> 05:26.051
- we need to double down.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:26.053 --> 05:27.820
What happened to your hair?

05:27.822 --> 05:29.655
What are you talking about?

05:31.092 --> 05:32.895
What? What is it?

05:34.495 --> 05:36.962
What happened to my
trademark volume and sheen?

05:36.964 --> 05:38.864
Who changed my rat's name?

05:38.866 --> 05:41.400
Yo, who switched my game?

05:41.402 --> 05:42.801
Gideon?

05:42.803 --> 05:44.570
A scan of the timeline reveals a change

05:44.572 --> 05:46.638
in Memphis, Tennessee, 1954.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.341
Oh, says here Memphis
became a ghost town

05:49.343 --> 05:53.679
after a mysterious bout of
mass hysteria in July, 1954.

05:53.681 --> 05:55.314
That's what caused the changes.

05:55.316 --> 05:57.249
Memphis is the birthplace
of rock and roll.

05:57.251 --> 05:59.084
If rock never makes it out of Memphis,

05:59.086 --> 06:00.853
then none of these things exist.

06:00.855 --> 06:04.757
Your pet rat's namesake,
electric guitar.

06:04.759 --> 06:07.326
- Your hair gel.
- It's not hair gel, Wally.

06:07.328 --> 06:08.794
It's Royal Crown pomade.

06:08.796 --> 06:10.896
- It's the same product used by...
- Elvis Presley.

06:10.898 --> 06:12.192
See, she knows what I'm talking about.

06:12.194 --> 06:13.832
No, dodo. Look.

06:13.834 --> 06:16.068
"While the population fled in hysterics,

06:16.070 --> 06:18.070
one person was left
standing in the aftermath,

06:18.072 --> 06:20.710
a local teen named Elvis Presley."

06:20.713 --> 06:22.141
Don't tell me they messed with the King.

06:22.143 --> 06:24.076
Whatever he saw drove him crazy.

06:24.078 --> 06:25.878
He was taken to the
Bolivar State Hospital.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.112
Treated for insanity.

06:27.114 --> 06:29.481
If Memphis is abandoned in '54,

06:29.483 --> 06:30.983
then rock doesn't hit the mainstream,

06:30.985 --> 06:32.384
which means there's no Howlin' Ray,

06:32.386 --> 06:33.507
no Little Richard...

06:33.510 --> 06:35.319
The Elvis sandwich...
Peanut butter and banana

06:35.322 --> 06:37.923
fried in greasy bacon fat.

06:37.925 --> 06:39.647
The man was a visionary.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.183
But if it didn't show up on
the anachronism map, then...

06:42.186 --> 06:43.796
Darhks.

06:43.798 --> 06:46.365
The only people evil enough
to wanna kill rock and roll.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.834
Oh, and I bet you that
sick bastard likes ska.

06:48.836 --> 06:50.302
All right, let's go check this out.

06:50.304 --> 06:52.538
We need to find Elvis
before panic sets in.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.816
Elvis Presley's uncle
preached at the Church of Zion

06:54.819 --> 06:56.041
every Sunday.

06:56.043 --> 06:57.409
The boy never missed a service.

06:57.411 --> 06:58.543
You heard the lady.

07:01.315 --> 07:03.682
What? Why are you staring at me?

07:03.684 --> 07:05.483
I dunno, waiting for you to do

07:05.486 --> 07:07.152
- the thing you do.
- What thing?

07:07.154 --> 07:08.787
You know, you usually
send us into the field

07:08.789 --> 07:10.067
with a little more pizzazz.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.093
All right, Legends,
put on your Sunday best,

07:14.095 --> 07:16.762
because we are going to church.

07:16.764 --> 07:17.963
That was pretty good.

07:17.965 --> 07:19.398
Amen!

07:19.400 --> 07:24.832
♪ Jesus loves me He will stay ♪

07:24.835 --> 07:30.008
♪ Close beside me all the way ♪

07:30.010 --> 07:36.381
♪ Thou hast bled and died for me ♪

07:36.383 --> 07:37.783
Well, this is uncomfortable,

07:37.785 --> 07:39.585
and I'm not just talking about my dress.

07:39.587 --> 07:41.353
Yeah, I guess these
people didn't get the whole

07:41.355 --> 07:42.855
"love thy neighbor" talk.

07:42.857 --> 07:44.556
- Shh!
- Shush yourself, lady.

07:44.558 --> 07:46.332
Have you heard your singing voice?

07:46.335 --> 07:48.827
Just keep Mick away
from the collection tray.

07:48.829 --> 07:50.229
And the communion wafers.

07:52.801 --> 07:54.667
That's not bread.

08:00.410 --> 08:04.279
There's a sickness
coming over this town.

08:05.579 --> 08:09.982
I see it in the school yard
as I pass in the morning.

08:11.385 --> 08:13.585
And to my horror,

08:13.587 --> 08:19.992
I see it in this very church on Sundays.

08:19.994 --> 08:24.596
It infects the mind.
It drives people crazy.

08:24.598 --> 08:27.933
Maybe the righteous
reverend is on to something.

08:27.935 --> 08:32.203
They call it rock and roll.

08:33.741 --> 08:36.775
I call it the devil's music.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.809
Nevermind, he has no idea
what he's talking about.

08:38.812 --> 08:44.583
Now, I would like to
invite my nephew, Elvis,

08:44.585 --> 08:47.619
to play for us and encourage you all

08:47.621 --> 08:52.324
to attend our first annual
Heavenly Night of Hymns.

08:53.994 --> 08:55.494
Elvis?

08:55.496 --> 08:57.829
Remember what we talked about, son.

08:57.831 --> 08:59.565
Keep it godly.

08:59.567 --> 09:00.699
Yes, ma'am.

09:04.838 --> 09:06.371
Can you believe this?

09:06.373 --> 09:10.609
The first show we see
together is Elvis live.

09:10.611 --> 09:12.544
You're not the only one who's excited.

09:25.025 --> 09:27.759
This one's called...

09:27.761 --> 09:30.195
"Onward, Christian Soldiers."

09:30.197 --> 09:31.386
Okay.

09:35.603 --> 09:40.606
♪ Onward Christian soldiers ♪

09:40.608 --> 09:44.910
♪ Marching as to war ♪

09:44.912 --> 09:47.079
So this is rock and roll?

09:47.081 --> 09:49.314
I mean, it's no Benny Goodman, but...

09:49.316 --> 09:51.629
No, we did not come all this way

09:51.632 --> 09:54.266
to listen to Elvis play grandma songs.

09:55.671 --> 09:58.056
♪ Christ the royal master ♪

09:58.058 --> 10:00.492
That's it, Elvis. Put

Yeah, swivel.

10:01.895 --> 10:03.597
♪ Leads against the foe ♪

10:03.600 --> 10:05.397

10:14.642 --> 10:16.246
Satan's got ahold of her!

10:16.249 --> 10:17.509
What the hell's going on?

10:17.511 --> 10:19.745
Ugh, my totem. It's
reacting to something.

10:21.048 --> 10:22.550
Be gone, Satan!

10:22.553 --> 10:24.316
Well, I think she's talking to us.

10:24.318 --> 10:25.517
Come on.

10:25.519 --> 10:28.253
Behold what you have seen

10:28.255 --> 10:29.788
with your very eyes!

10:29.790 --> 10:34.326
Witnessed in this house of God!

10:34.328 --> 10:36.785
That is the act of Satan!

10:36.788 --> 10:37.896
Yes, it is.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.299
- Sure is. Sure is.
- Yes, it is.

10:42.569 --> 10:45.070
The Elvis sandwich.

10:45.072 --> 10:46.872
I guess Elvis is the
King of rock and roll.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.504
One hip shake, and Z loses it.

10:48.507 --> 10:50.142
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

10:50.144 --> 10:52.177
I didn't lose control
because of Elvis' hips.

10:52.179 --> 10:53.879
Yeah, me, either.

10:53.881 --> 10:57.513
My totem was glowing,
and so was Elvis' guitar.

10:58.852 --> 11:00.652
But that means that Elvis is...

11:00.655 --> 11:04.289
Yep. Elvis is a totem bearer.

11:05.774 --> 11:09.650
So Elvis is the bearer of
the long lost sixth totem.

11:09.653 --> 11:12.320
Consider me all shook up.

11:12.322 --> 11:13.755
So he has to join the team, right?

11:13.758 --> 11:14.955
- No.
- I mean, we can't

11:14.958 --> 11:16.752
defeat Mallus unless we have a full set.

11:16.755 --> 11:18.460
I mean, we could get
Gideon to fabricate him

11:18.462 --> 11:20.328
a spangly jumpsuit,
and he'll fit right in.

11:20.330 --> 11:22.897
What totem would choose
a guitar-toting choir boy

11:22.899 --> 11:24.566
- as its bearer?
- Isn't it obvious?

11:24.568 --> 11:25.834
It's Elvis we're talking about.

11:25.836 --> 11:27.902
- It's gotta be...
- A sandwich totem.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.462
I was gonna say music.

11:29.465 --> 11:30.905
Just imagine what the
music totem would do

11:30.907 --> 11:32.374
for my upper register.

11:32.376 --> 11:34.042
I could finally give
local theater a shot.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.412
That is, after we use
it to destroy Mallus.

11:37.414 --> 11:39.981
So we're gonna vanquish a time demon

11:39.983 --> 11:42.484
with our killer harmonies.
It's gonna go great.

11:42.486 --> 11:44.286
Every totem is growing stronger

11:44.288 --> 11:46.087
in response to Mallus' threat.

11:46.089 --> 11:48.657
What if the preacher was right
and Elvis' music literally

11:48.659 --> 11:50.017
drives Memphis insane?

11:50.020 --> 11:52.060
Then we have to get
it before that happens.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.196
I got it. Elvis' guitar totem.

11:56.199 --> 11:58.366
So, I'm not the only one who
finds that annoying, right?

11:58.368 --> 11:59.534
- So annoying.
- Yeah.

11:59.536 --> 12:01.131
Okay, come on. We're good to go, right?

12:01.134 --> 12:01.846
Are we?

12:01.849 --> 12:03.557
'Cause Elvis hasn't recorded
his first single yet.

12:03.559 --> 12:05.340
And without that guitar,
he may never record it.

12:05.342 --> 12:06.708
Which means rock and roll history is...

12:06.710 --> 12:07.809
Josh Groban.

12:09.513 --> 12:11.403
What if we have Gideon
fabricate a ringer guitar

12:11.406 --> 12:13.081
and drop it off to the future King?

12:13.083 --> 12:14.723
Great idea. I call A-mission.

12:14.726 --> 12:15.917
Amaya, come with me.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.452
I will teach you what
rock and roll is all about.

12:17.454 --> 12:19.562
Till then, everyone
shake, rattle, and roll!

12:20.549 --> 12:24.191
Beale Street was the heart
of the music scene in Memphis

12:24.194 --> 12:25.894
in the 1950s.

12:25.896 --> 12:28.396
Brothels, churches, juke joints,

12:28.398 --> 12:31.132
all next to each other, all black owned.

12:31.134 --> 12:34.247
This... this was the
spirit of rock and roll.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.205
♪ You can remember too ♪

12:37.207 --> 12:39.274
There he is.

12:39.276 --> 12:40.842
It was right here.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.211
Hey, kid.

12:42.214 --> 12:43.812
I don't think you wanna
keep this lying around.

12:43.814 --> 12:44.998
Something tells me it's special.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.430
You have no idea.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.451
There's no way I'd ever be
able to thank you for this.

12:48.453 --> 12:49.984
Well, if you wanna
write a song about me,

12:49.986 --> 12:51.794
there are several words
that rhyme with Nate.

12:51.797 --> 12:53.888
Ow!

12:53.890 --> 12:55.156
Just knock them dead.

12:57.561 --> 13:00.595
I can't wait for you to see Elvis live.

13:00.597 --> 13:02.530
It's going to change your life.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.770
You really believe that
my life can be changed

13:04.773 --> 13:06.601
- by one song?
- Of course.

13:06.603 --> 13:09.204
Music is so much more than just songs.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.739
Music is about identity.

13:10.741 --> 13:12.841
It's hearing a track for the first time

13:12.843 --> 13:17.479
and you think to yourself,
"Wow, this is who I am."

13:17.481 --> 13:19.347
I don't care how long it takes.

13:19.349 --> 13:21.516
We're gonna find your music,
whether it be rock and roll

13:21.518 --> 13:23.318
or, God forbid, ska.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.265
Debuting tonight, y'all,
give it up for Elvis Presley.

13:26.268 --> 13:28.586
I guess it's time to
have my life changed.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.494
How you folks doing tonight?

13:32.496 --> 13:33.728
Ow!

13:33.730 --> 13:35.130
If it's all right with y'all,

13:35.132 --> 13:36.931
I'm gonna play a
little song for my mama.

13:53.617 --> 13:55.216
Sometime tonight!

13:55.218 --> 13:56.284
Now you...

14:03.226 --> 14:04.961
Wait, don't go.

14:04.964 --> 14:07.536
Why, y'all wanna make fun of
my playing like everybody else?

14:07.539 --> 14:10.098
No, actually. We're, uh...

14:10.100 --> 14:11.833
We're music managers.

14:11.835 --> 14:13.535
And we think you're very talented.

14:13.537 --> 14:15.870
So, uh, what happened up there?

14:17.007 --> 14:18.406
It's this doggone guitar.

14:18.408 --> 14:19.941
It ain't working how it's supposed to.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.143
Y'all gonna think I'm
crazy, but my guitar,

14:22.145 --> 14:24.245
it's more than just a guitar.

14:24.247 --> 14:25.747
Now it ain't working right, I just...

14:25.749 --> 14:27.849
You don't feel like yourself anymore.

14:27.851 --> 14:29.451
Yes, ma'am.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.418
And I'll tell you why.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.620
Usually, when I play...

14:32.622 --> 14:34.805
I got my twin brother,
Jesse, up there to back me up.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.624
You have a twin brother?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.993
Well, he ain't with us no more.

14:38.995 --> 14:40.762
Passed when he was a baby.

14:40.764 --> 14:43.497
But this guitar of mine
used to connect me to him.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.653
I told you y'all would think I'm crazy.

14:45.656 --> 14:47.305
No, not at all.

14:47.308 --> 14:49.552
I've always believed that
objects can connect us

14:49.555 --> 14:50.805
to our ancestors.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.241
Yeah, I guess we call it a spirit, like.

14:53.243 --> 14:56.277
On stage... On stage just
now for the first time,

14:56.279 --> 14:57.875
Jesse wasn't with me.

14:57.878 --> 14:59.258
I mean, he's gone.

14:59.261 --> 15:01.216
All of a sudden, I just
don't know where he is.

15:05.489 --> 15:06.821
Whoa, that was weird.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.122
Yeah.

15:09.259 --> 15:10.525
You feel that?

15:10.527 --> 15:12.160
Yeah, it's freezing.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.829
I am detecting an EMF
reading of six milligaus

15:14.831 --> 15:17.057
that is disturbing the
ship's electrical servers.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.059
E-M-what?

15:18.062 --> 15:19.467
Electromagnetic field.

15:19.469 --> 15:21.236
It's a scientific term
that's been wrapped up

15:21.238 --> 15:24.472
in a bunch of paranormal nonsense.

15:27.711 --> 15:30.245
Paranormal, as in...

15:44.828 --> 15:46.227
Ghosts.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.848
Whoever you are, just
put the guitar down.

15:54.252 --> 15:57.286
Doesn't look like he's taking requests.

15:57.288 --> 15:59.588
Maybe the preacher was
right about rock and roll.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.858
You know what never hurt anyone?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.292
A nice show tune.

16:11.335 --> 16:12.390
I got it!

16:21.078 --> 16:22.711
Okay, Axl.

16:22.713 --> 16:24.513
Time to break the seal.

16:30.921 --> 16:32.457
Axl, come back!

16:32.460 --> 16:33.722
What the hell is going on?

16:34.992 --> 16:36.525
Guitar hit me in the head.

16:36.527 --> 16:39.628
Oh, that explains nothing.

16:40.664 --> 16:41.830
I got ya!

16:41.832 --> 16:43.398
The guitar! It's haunted!

16:43.400 --> 16:44.733
We know.

16:44.735 --> 16:46.301
Oh!

16:49.039 --> 16:50.184
But by who?

16:51.609 --> 16:54.276
That's what's so
strange about my brother.

16:54.278 --> 16:55.544
I ain't never met Jesse,

16:55.546 --> 16:57.713
but somehow I missed him all my life.

16:57.715 --> 16:59.414
Until you bought your first guitar.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.184
Yeah, the store said it was cursed.

17:02.186 --> 17:03.318
He was only half right.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.020
It was also a blessing, too.

17:05.021 --> 17:07.289
Well, my brother's out
there somewhere without me.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.991
I can't imagine he's too happy.

17:11.395 --> 17:12.473
Excuse me.

17:14.798 --> 17:16.665
Guys, Elvis' guitar's haunted.

17:18.301 --> 17:19.874
We know!

17:19.877 --> 17:21.569
Yeah, and I'm guessing it's
gonna do whatever it takes

17:21.571 --> 17:22.570
to get back to Elvis.

17:22.573 --> 17:23.573
Good guess!

17:24.942 --> 17:26.340
Where's Axl?

17:26.343 --> 17:27.709
About that ghost.

17:27.711 --> 17:30.178
It's Elvis' dead twin, Jesse.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.580
Jesse, stop!

17:31.582 --> 17:33.015
We know your brother.

17:35.052 --> 17:38.420
Now, I know this all
sounds like hogwash.

17:38.422 --> 17:39.721
Magical guitars,

17:39.723 --> 17:41.255
the ghosts of gone family members.

17:41.258 --> 17:43.725
But I can't play without him.

17:43.727 --> 17:46.238
I got a session to record
at Sun Studios tomorrow.

17:46.241 --> 17:47.523
I saved up to buy it.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.031
It's your first recording session.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.299
Uh-huh.

17:50.301 --> 17:51.800
You're gonna keep that appointment.

17:51.802 --> 17:53.324
And we're gonna get you Jesse back.

17:53.327 --> 17:55.937
- You will?
- We will?

17:55.940 --> 17:59.007
All right, so, I talked to
Constantine about our totem.

17:59.009 --> 18:03.512
He compared it with his notes,
and this is what he found.

18:03.514 --> 18:05.747
Death Totem? Pass.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.340
Yeah, whoever wields it
has domain over the dead.

18:08.343 --> 18:10.852
Which is why we need to
keep this totem with us

18:10.854 --> 18:12.321
and safe at all times.

18:12.323 --> 18:13.889
Elvis needs his totem back.

18:13.891 --> 18:16.925
You have no idea what
we are dealing with.

18:16.927 --> 18:18.827
The Death Totem?

18:18.829 --> 18:21.463
The most volatile of all
of the totems lost for eons

18:21.465 --> 18:23.799
along with the sixth tribe of Zambezi.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.367
Maybe they suffered the same fate

18:25.369 --> 18:26.874
that's about to befall Memphis.

18:26.877 --> 18:28.877
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

18:28.879 --> 18:30.405
We are talking about a Death Totem,

18:30.407 --> 18:33.041
and it could turn this whole
place into a ghost town.

18:33.043 --> 18:35.777
Elvis has a session at Sun Studios.

18:35.779 --> 18:37.379
That's where he cuts his first demo.

18:37.381 --> 18:39.610
That's how he gets discovered, okay?

18:39.613 --> 18:43.485
We do not have the time for
Elvis to get his groove back.

18:43.487 --> 18:44.894
Jesse has to be there.

18:44.897 --> 18:48.023
Nathaniel, I understand how
important this is to you.

18:48.025 --> 18:50.492
But we can't give Elvis a
totem just to save his music.

18:50.494 --> 18:52.027
It's not about the music, okay?

18:52.029 --> 18:55.634
Rock has inspired many
historic milestones.

18:55.637 --> 18:59.290
Protests, revolutions,
me losing my virginity.

19:02.139 --> 19:03.739
Elvis doesn't need a totem forever.

19:05.309 --> 19:07.563
Just one song that changes the world.

19:09.202 --> 19:10.245
Please.

19:15.185 --> 19:16.590
Fine.

19:16.593 --> 19:19.121
You take it to him, you
let him record with it,

19:19.124 --> 19:21.344
and you stay with it at all times.

19:21.347 --> 19:23.191
At all times!

19:23.194 --> 19:26.028
At all times.

19:30.771 --> 19:32.121
All right, son.

19:32.124 --> 19:34.335
Are you ready to lay
this down on wax, or what?

Wow.

20:16.313 --> 20:18.580

be our music moment.

20:18.582 --> 20:20.176
Our music moment?

20:20.179 --> 20:22.617
One of those times where
the right song comes on

20:22.619 --> 20:26.721
and ties everything together
so perfectly that it becomes...

20:26.723 --> 20:28.490
It becomes a story.

20:28.492 --> 20:30.425
We already have plenty of stories.

20:30.427 --> 20:31.907
We saved the world together.

20:31.910 --> 20:33.746
- Yeah.

There was that time
that I discovered Netflix

20:36.133 --> 20:38.133
and we watched every episode
of "Friends" in one week.

20:38.135 --> 20:40.435
All stunning accomplishments, yes.

Well, well, well.

Not after what we saw in church.

21:21.324 --> 21:23.912
Look, I got talent. My manager says so.

21:23.914 --> 21:26.915
You got my nephew into this?

21:26.917 --> 21:29.121
Yeah.

21:29.124 --> 21:31.402
Hey, that ain't yours to take, now!

21:31.405 --> 21:33.254
Give me that back! I
knew you'd put up a fight!

21:33.257 --> 21:34.456
Sheriff!

21:34.458 --> 21:36.124
Get him out of here!

21:36.126 --> 21:37.959
Let's see if a night in the jailhouse

21:37.961 --> 21:39.504
rocks some sense into you.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.274
That record's gotta make
it on the radio tonight.

21:41.276 --> 21:42.371
Get him outta here, too!

21:42.374 --> 21:43.698
You're making a huge mistake.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.157
Get behind me, Satan.

21:47.304 --> 21:48.937
White Stripes. Great album.

21:48.939 --> 21:50.105
At least, it was.

21:56.030 --> 21:59.217
Your mama's been too easy on you, boy.

21:59.219 --> 22:01.086
Look at the sort you got mixed up with.

22:01.088 --> 22:03.588
These are the types that
go on down to Beale Street

22:03.590 --> 22:05.190
and dance the hoochie-koo like heathens!

22:05.192 --> 22:07.125
You keep on preaching hate.

22:07.127 --> 22:08.827
I'm only trying to bring folks together.

22:08.829 --> 22:11.630
As the Lord destroyed the wicked,

22:11.632 --> 22:14.633
I must do the same with this record.

22:14.635 --> 22:16.167
I'll make an example of you

22:16.169 --> 22:18.136
at the Heavenly Nights of Hymns.

22:18.138 --> 22:20.238
That ought to teach them
young folks a lesson.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.440
Reverend, you don't know
what you're messing with.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.042
The music your nephew makes...

22:24.044 --> 22:27.045
Has turned Memphis
into Sodom and Gomorrah.

22:28.350 --> 22:30.965
I will not allow it to be the ruination

22:30.968 --> 22:32.587
of that boy's soul, too.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.305
Don't worry. We'll get you out of here.

22:42.262 --> 22:45.163
All I ever wanted to do
was make my mama proud.

22:45.165 --> 22:47.298
Now she ain't never gonna
hear my song on the radio.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.714
At least I still got you, Jesse.

22:51.717 --> 22:53.304
Guys, we have a bit of a setback.

22:53.307 --> 22:54.324
We're listening. What's up?

22:54.326 --> 22:55.749
Um, long story, funny ending.

22:55.752 --> 22:57.867
Amaya, Elvis, and I were
thrown in the slammer.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.445
So just steel up and break out.

22:59.448 --> 23:00.753
Yeah, I know, I can, but I'm afraid

23:00.755 --> 23:02.566
- my work here isn't done.
- What do you need?

23:02.569 --> 23:04.101
I need you to go back to the church,

23:04.104 --> 23:05.417
get the record from the reverend,

23:05.419 --> 23:09.304
and bring it to WHBQ and
make sure it debuts tonight.

23:09.307 --> 23:10.422
On it.

23:10.425 --> 23:11.839
Despite everything you've seen,

23:11.842 --> 23:13.692
I really think my powers
could come in handy right now

23:13.694 --> 23:15.295
because I could just
go grab that record,

23:15.298 --> 23:16.632
- and then I...
- Okay, if this were

23:16.634 --> 23:17.934
a Central City bank robbery, sure.

23:17.936 --> 23:19.303
You could just speed in, save the day,

23:19.305 --> 23:20.672
the mayor would give
you a key to the city.

23:20.674 --> 23:22.007
That actually happened, you know.

23:22.010 --> 23:23.110
See, Barry and I, we saw this...

23:23.112 --> 23:24.302
History is different.

23:24.304 --> 23:26.504
You can't be a chainsaw.
You need to be a scalpel.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.873
You... you need to get
in there, talk to people,

23:28.875 --> 23:30.475
find out what they really need.

23:30.477 --> 23:33.712
Now let's go talk to the
preacher like human beings.

23:35.916 --> 23:39.451
Okay, Axl. I know how to draw you out.

23:39.453 --> 23:43.588
With a nice little snack.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.097
Mick?

23:52.099 --> 23:53.264
Mick, don't panic.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.599
You just forgot to chew again.

23:57.671 --> 23:59.571
Axl.

23:59.573 --> 24:02.540
Is this one of your
stupid science experiments?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.876
- Looks like Josh Grobin...
- Axl!

24:04.878 --> 24:06.211
Found something even more lethal

24:06.213 --> 24:08.680
than your Elvis sandwich.

24:08.682 --> 24:10.648
I'm sorry, buddy.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.148
Look, the life expectancy of
a rat is 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years.

24:14.151 --> 24:17.689
So, you know, the little
guy really beat the odds.

24:17.691 --> 24:18.885
And you know what?

24:18.888 --> 24:20.254
We can pick you up another one

24:20.257 --> 24:21.760
in the next time period we stop in.

24:21.763 --> 24:24.561
Because what's one more
change on this ship?

24:29.362 --> 24:32.303
♪ Jailhouse blues ♪

24:32.305 --> 24:34.672
♪ Jailhouse party ♪

24:34.674 --> 24:36.241
You're getting warmer.

24:36.243 --> 24:38.843
There's gotta be a song
in here somewhere, Jesse.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.513
Okay, song-writing time out.

24:41.515 --> 24:43.948
Listen, um,

24:43.950 --> 24:45.717
there's no easy way to say this,

24:45.719 --> 24:47.218
but when we get out of here,

24:47.220 --> 24:49.254
you're gonna have to
give us that guitar.

24:49.256 --> 24:51.689
It has power, and it can be dangerous.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.085
No. I mean, I can't play

24:54.088 --> 24:55.393
without Jesse.

24:55.396 --> 24:59.080
I mean, before he came
along, sure, there was songs,

24:59.083 --> 25:01.778
but there wasn't ever any music.

25:01.781 --> 25:03.434
Look, even after he's gone,

25:03.436 --> 25:04.803
you're gonna have the music.

25:04.805 --> 25:07.172
I mean, that's why you play, right?

25:07.174 --> 25:09.474
The real reason music matters

25:09.476 --> 25:12.210
is because it keeps things
alive long after they're gone.

25:14.548 --> 25:16.614
Any idea why Ray needs us?

25:16.616 --> 25:17.849
No clue.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.086
Whatever this is, I don't like it.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.112
Wait, what is that?

25:24.115 --> 25:26.224
We're gathered here in remembrance

25:26.226 --> 25:27.358
of our dear friend Axl.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.527
Right. I'm outta here.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.896
- I'm with him.
- Wait, you need this.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.799
We... we all need this.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.435
Fine, but when I mourn, I drink.

25:37.437 --> 25:38.636
Fair enough.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.373
Charles Dickens once wrote,

25:42.375 --> 25:47.245
"Life is made of ever so many
partings, welded together."

25:47.247 --> 25:49.914
Axl is one such parting.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.951
And while we may lose some,
they are never really gone.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.086
And they certainly can't be replaced.

25:55.088 --> 25:58.223
They'll live on in the
memories we shared with them

25:58.225 --> 26:00.458
and the lessons they taught us.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.695
And it is because of that
that we can embrace the change.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.564
I still remember

26:06.566 --> 26:08.433
the first time I met Axl.

26:08.435 --> 26:09.734
It was in the vents.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.935
I was tiny Atom.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.070
He was a big rat.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.504
And he tried to eat me.

26:13.506 --> 26:15.173
I knew we'd laugh about it

26:15.175 --> 26:16.187
one day together.

26:17.419 --> 26:19.444
Sara, I believe it's
customary for the Captain

26:19.446 --> 26:20.729
to share a few words.

26:20.732 --> 26:22.881
Oh, no, you... You're doing a great job.

26:22.883 --> 26:25.516
Thank you. Well then,

26:25.518 --> 26:28.286
please join me in a chorus
of "Sweet Child of Mine."

26:30.790 --> 26:33.124
All right, I'll say something.

26:33.126 --> 26:34.259
Mmm.

26:35.829 --> 26:39.664
Axl was a friend.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.132
Our friend.

26:41.135 --> 26:44.163
Some might say he was the best of us.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.780
Can we have a word?

26:55.782 --> 26:56.984
And not the good word.

26:56.987 --> 26:58.249
We just wanna talk.

26:58.251 --> 27:00.151
What could you possibly
wanna talk about?

27:00.153 --> 27:01.619
We need to talk to you about your nephew

27:01.621 --> 27:03.521
and his record. You can't destroy it.

27:03.523 --> 27:06.624
People need to hear
it. That includes you.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.570
How would y'all know
what I need to hear?

27:08.573 --> 27:12.764
I might actually know
what you're going through.

27:12.766 --> 27:14.766
You see, my dad, he came into my life

27:14.768 --> 27:16.018
pretty late.

27:16.021 --> 27:18.503
We couldn't always
figure each other out.

27:18.505 --> 27:20.939
We didn't always know how to
fit into each other's lives

27:20.941 --> 27:25.944
until I knew that I just had
to go and set out on my own.

27:25.946 --> 27:27.979
Truly sorry to hear that, son.

27:27.982 --> 27:29.981
I think that you might be afraid

27:29.983 --> 27:32.250
that you're losing your nephew.

27:32.252 --> 27:34.886
But if you both could just
try to understand each other,

27:34.888 --> 27:37.445
you might actually find
something new between you two,

27:37.448 --> 27:38.890
You might...

27:38.892 --> 27:41.424
You might even find
something really special.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.895
Now, I know someone that
would love to play that record,

27:43.897 --> 27:45.396
if you're ready to give it a chance.

27:45.398 --> 27:49.367
And a lot of young souls would be moved

27:49.369 --> 27:50.668
by your nephew's voice.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.335
Hmm.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.010
Mysterious ways, indeed.

28:16.463 --> 28:18.663
Okay, so, we walked real
far and it took a long time,

28:18.665 --> 28:20.231
and then, uh, we got thrown around...

28:20.233 --> 28:22.600
History's at stake.
You'd better run fast.

28:31.211 --> 28:35.031
Hoo-wee, Daddy-O-Dewey
here with a new record.

28:35.034 --> 28:36.648
Literally burning my fingers.

28:36.651 --> 28:39.250
By a young local boy,
name of Elvis Presley.

28:39.252 --> 28:41.010
Remember where you heard it first.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.322
How on Earth...

28:46.793 --> 28:48.926
My nephew is on the radio.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.195
My nephew is on the radio!

Maybe you ain't so
ungoldly as I thought.

You know, you and I might
have different names for God,

29:33.173 --> 29:36.207

a lot in common, too.

This time he actually might be right.

30:44.638 --> 30:46.141
Don't tell me you're converting.

30:46.144 --> 30:48.773
No, Elvis recorded that
song with the Death Totem.

30:48.775 --> 30:50.342
It must have given his music the power

30:50.344 --> 30:51.543
to literally raise spirits.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.040
You're kidding.

30:53.043 --> 30:55.880
This must have been what

Okay, Mick.

31:23.290 --> 31:24.689

31:51.204 --> 31:52.370
from taking out the ghosts.

31:52.372 --> 31:54.706
Let's make Ms. Pac-Man proud!

31:59.306 --> 32:00.845

Impressive.

33:48.587 --> 33:51.537
Now your song has gone and
let the devil into my church.

33:51.540 --> 33:53.907
This ain't the devil's doing.

33:53.910 --> 33:56.600
You were right. Music has a power.

33:56.603 --> 33:57.857
Brings life to the lifeless,

33:57.860 --> 33:59.359
soothes the souls of the restless.

33:59.362 --> 34:01.592
But it ain't just rock and roll, either.

34:01.595 --> 34:03.929
I would like to prove it.

34:03.932 --> 34:05.969
Put an end to all this, while I'm at it.

34:08.775 --> 34:11.509
All right. Get on up there, boy.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.655
Now, I know y'all can hear me.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.525

be spending a lot more time

37:57.820 --> 37:59.947
in here, especially after
that show you just put on.

37:59.950 --> 38:02.082
Ah, something came over me, I guess.

38:02.084 --> 38:04.217
I was up there looking at those ghosts,

38:04.219 --> 38:07.988
I realized one day this is all
gonna be over for all of us.

38:07.990 --> 38:11.091
Might as well get the most
out of life that we can.

38:11.093 --> 38:12.859
You know what?

38:12.861 --> 38:15.262
I think you just discovered
the spirit of rock and roll.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.533
I think that this...

38:21.937 --> 38:23.770
Is probably gonna be safer with you.

38:23.772 --> 38:25.372
That was fun and all,

38:25.374 --> 38:27.741
but I don't soon wanna
be raising the dead again.

38:27.743 --> 38:29.109
Promise me you'll keep playing,

38:29.111 --> 38:30.510
even without your brother.

38:30.512 --> 38:33.213
Aw, Jesse ain't really gone.

38:33.215 --> 38:36.349
The things he taught me,
the love that we had...

38:37.927 --> 38:39.390
It's gonna live on in my music.

38:40.823 --> 38:42.956
Now, can I ask you a question?

38:42.958 --> 38:44.725
You ain't really a
music manager, are you?

38:46.161 --> 38:47.288
Busted.

38:48.466 --> 38:50.796
But something tells me
you're gonna be just fine.

38:50.799 --> 38:53.200
Even without this.

38:53.202 --> 38:54.868
Thanks to you.

38:54.870 --> 38:56.269
Think I'm just about ready.

38:57.473 --> 38:58.601
Go get 'em.

39:02.010 --> 39:04.344
All right, gentlemen. How y'all doing?

39:04.346 --> 39:06.346
I say we start it off with
something a little bit,

39:06.348 --> 39:07.924
uh, fast tempo.

39:07.927 --> 39:09.616
Okay, fellas, get your fingers going.

39:16.692 --> 39:17.924
You rang, Captain?

39:17.926 --> 39:20.594
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

39:20.596 --> 39:23.029
- Look at that volume.
- Don't touch it.

39:23.031 --> 39:24.631
- How do you...
- I'm serious, don't touch it.

39:24.633 --> 39:26.453
Well, well, well. Look
who got his swagger back.

39:26.455 --> 39:27.400
Ah, me?

39:27.402 --> 39:28.969
Just because I saved rock and roll

39:28.971 --> 39:30.789
and reinstated the King
to his proper throne...

39:30.791 --> 39:34.608
Doesn't give you an excuse
to hog our one bathroom.

39:34.610 --> 39:36.744
- Some of us need to...
- Celebrate the fact

39:36.747 --> 39:38.812
that we beat the Darhks
to the Death Totem.

39:38.814 --> 39:40.147
Although I don't imagine our acquisition

39:40.149 --> 39:41.782
will stay off the radar for long.

39:41.784 --> 39:43.190
Well, think of it like this.

39:43.193 --> 39:45.819
We're four totems up
in the fourth quarter.

39:45.821 --> 39:48.421
Time's running out for those idiots.

39:48.423 --> 39:50.690
Yep, even though they still have mine.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.526
Well, they'll be Time
Stoning back two whatever hell

39:52.528 --> 39:54.394
they came from once
we get your totem back.

39:54.396 --> 39:55.662
Yeah, and in the meantime,
we need to make sure

39:55.664 --> 39:58.098
we keep that Death Totem on lock.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.667
Box. Lock boxes.

40:00.669 --> 40:02.435
I... I got it covered.

40:02.437 --> 40:05.972
I made encrypted lock boxes
for each one of the totems.

40:05.974 --> 40:07.507
Well, good.

40:07.509 --> 40:08.975
The Death Totem's powers are not

40:08.977 --> 40:10.377
to be taken lightly.

40:14.283 --> 40:16.416
Perhaps you need some
assistance, Miss Jiwe.

40:16.418 --> 40:19.186
Just give me a moment, Gideon, please.

40:19.188 --> 40:20.754
I've sabotaged access tanks.

40:20.756 --> 40:23.723
I am sure I can figure
out a stupid playlist.

40:23.725 --> 40:26.626
Hey, Gideon said you wanted to see me.

40:26.628 --> 40:28.428
I wanted to say thank you.

40:28.430 --> 40:30.530
Oh, you don't...

40:30.532 --> 40:32.575
Check you out. You got a playlist going?

40:32.578 --> 40:35.335
As soon as I'm done uploading
all the Smiths music,

40:35.337 --> 40:37.540
we'll do a deep dive into the
Morrissey solo stuff that...

40:37.542 --> 40:39.738
Actually, I thought it was
time for me to teach you

40:39.741 --> 40:42.108
about my music.

40:42.110 --> 40:43.710
Okay.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.492
Like some big band stuff?

40:45.495 --> 40:47.989
I think I'm at a point where I
can appreciate a trumpet solo.

40:47.992 --> 40:51.017
No, this is the music of Zambesi.

40:51.019 --> 40:53.920
Gideon helped me locate
some supposedly lost tracks.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.188
You like it?

40:59.191 --> 41:01.661
Yeah... oh, it's... I like... I love it!

41:01.663 --> 41:03.110
So good.

41:03.113 --> 41:05.179
Now you know how I feel
about rock and roll.

41:05.182 --> 41:06.581
What's that?

41:06.584 --> 41:08.526
I said you're almost at the good part.

41:08.529 --> 41:09.970
You mean this isn't the good part?

41:12.441 --> 41:14.140
I love you, Nathaniel.

41:15.544 --> 41:17.244
What?

41:17.246 --> 41:20.360
I said there's a lot
more where that came from.

41:20.363 --> 41:22.348
It's a good thing we got time.
