00:49.480 --> 00:50.629
Ticket, please.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.560
Just one, please.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
Two, please.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.560
Enjoy the show.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
Yes, sir?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.035
One adult.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.749
Strong, silent, sensibly new.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.029
The 1960 Impala Convertible
by Chevrolet.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.760
Hey, Tony.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.388
Evening, Mr. Kimmel. Have you
met my girlfriend? She's a...

01:26.880 --> 01:28.029
Greater leg room.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.189
Roomy reasons why Chevrolet is
first in the value that lasts.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.919
Across the USA,

01:45.120 --> 01:47.634
Chevrolet is the way
to start the sixties right.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.616
...Saratoga Springs,

02:55.640 --> 02:56.834
the body of a woman was found

02:57.000 --> 02:58.319
brutally stabbed
just yards away

02:58.480 --> 02:59.913
from Harry's Rainbow grill,

03:00.080 --> 03:01.559
one of the bus's regular stops.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.393
The husband has put out a plea
to anyone who saw anything,

03:04.560 --> 03:05.675
to come forward.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.536
Now boarding green
line bus to Saratoga Springs

03:08.560 --> 03:10.312
at gate 5.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.829
Clara!

03:17.200 --> 03:19.919
Honestly. Why do you always
insist on seeing me off

03:20.080 --> 03:21.513
if you're going to be late?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.555
So you heard,
my mother is dying, again.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.829
I have some good news.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.633
Well, I think it's good news.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.073
My story's
in this month's issue!

03:31.320 --> 03:32.548
That's the good news?

03:33.440 --> 03:35.192
Why don't you focus
on your real job?

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
Wait till you read it.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.159
I will wait.
I have to work.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.920
I have all the paperwork on
the sale of the Carter house.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
People are boarding.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.279
I wish I could drive you.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.073
We could stop on the way
just like old times.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.992
I like the bus.
Gives me time to think.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.000
Well, could you
think about our party, please?

04:04.120 --> 04:05.633
I suppose I have to.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.672
But for God's sake, don't invite Jon.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.000
You know Jon has to be there.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.216
If we don't ask, he won't
come again, just like Jack.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.593
And what a loss he's been.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.516
Let's not quarrel, honey. Okay?

04:17.279 --> 04:20.636
I'll see you in a few days!
We'll make it a hell of a party!

04:20.880 --> 04:22.472
Send my regards to your mother.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
Thank you.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.560
Sorry, folks!

04:38.920 --> 04:41.957
Our first rest stop tonight is gonna
be a bit further on up the highway.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.872
Harry's Rainbow Grill is closed.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.837
Some sort of
police investigation.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
Nothing we can do.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.555
Take care.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.032
It was a good turnout
for Mrs. Kimmel.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.078
Yeah. Thanks, Tony. She was...

07:23.720 --> 07:25.199
She was really loved.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.318
Any more news, Detective Corby?

07:40.760 --> 07:41.829
No, nothing new.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.629
But I never give up.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.395
You can tell that to Mr. Kimmel.
Should be comforting.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.118
I'll be sure to tell him, sir.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.830
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you very much.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.640
- I'm so sorry.
- That's very kind. Thank you.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.440
God, I hope they don't
drag snow into the house.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.475
What are you talking about?

08:12.640 --> 08:13.760
They're walking up the path.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.314
None of the women want to
ruin their shoes. Lighten up.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.880
Come on, kids.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.480
Oh, Bill!

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
Betty.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.232
- Great to see you.
- Hi Betty.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.954
Can you believe it?
The Stackhouse's entertain.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.120
Okay.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.188
Thank you very much,
Walter. And I must say,

08:43.559 --> 08:46.074
your wife is the
most wonderful person.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.711
There's not a house
she can't buy or sell.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.592
You're gonna be able
to quit work soon.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.952
Taking on her pretty face was
the smartest thing I ever did.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.869
Sorry, I have to go,

08:58.160 --> 08:59.160
do my duty.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.789
Martha.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.348
So glad you could make it.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.279
I hope you don't mind that I
brought my friend Ellie along.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.833
She was having a dull day.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.911
I'm sorry I can't
promise fireworks.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.149
But we'll do our best.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
Martha!

09:14.640 --> 09:15.709
Excuse me.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.792
So this is the good life?

09:23.840 --> 09:24.840
Yeah.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.359
- Let me get you a drink.
- Any chance of a beer?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.511
A beer?
I think we got one of those.

09:31.720 --> 09:32.789
Don't move an inch.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.432
Martha gave me
the story you wrote.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.069
I loved it.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.515
Ah well. They've taken another.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
That's really cool.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.628
Here I was, thinking
you were just a...

10:04.960 --> 10:06.109
straight up architect.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.157
Oh no.
Nothing straight up about me.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.152
Well, what do you do? Or...

10:13.560 --> 10:14.993
Maybe I should try and guess.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.754
- I might take offense.
- No, I want to guess.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.989
Indulge me.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
Musician...

10:21.840 --> 10:24.798
of some sort. You write poetry.
You live in The Village.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.831
Two out of three,
that's not bad.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.474
I don't write poetry.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.759
- There you are.
- Uh.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.751
This is Jon Caar.
We work together.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.514
Martha puts up with
both of us. Jon meet Ellie.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
Ellie Briess.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.593
I meant to ask.
Can you get away on Sunday?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.199
I don't know,

10:43.360 --> 10:46.318
- Clara and I are supposed to...
- I get it. Don't do it, Walter.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.909
Same old story.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.991
Give me a break, man. Okay?

10:53.680 --> 10:57.195
They need food. And soon
before they start to fall over.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.878
Who was that girl
Martha brought?

11:14.480 --> 11:15.799
I don't know her name.

11:16.680 --> 11:17.680
I do.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.519
It's Ellie Briess.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
Who is she?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.793
Oh, I don't know.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.629
And I don't care.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.995
Come on.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.354
Come on, come on, come on.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.272
You are a sex maniac.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.992
You used to love my mania.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.391
Come on, Kits,
let's try to remember.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.954
Why don't we start by

11:47.240 --> 11:49.151
christening every room
in this house?

11:51.080 --> 11:52.274
Please, Walter.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.076
Not tonight.
Can't you just go to sleep?

12:00.040 --> 12:03.077
Ah, God. When is it going
to fucking end, Clara?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.359
Why are you so unhappy?

12:06.120 --> 12:09.078
Hm? You promised me
you'd go see someone.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.157
I just don't wanna see anyone.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.159
And it's not my fault. Can't you
just... Just leave me alone.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.993
I told you, detective.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.958
I don't know anyone who would
have wanted to kill Helen.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.918
I appreciate you coming around,
but I need time.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.034
Time to grieve.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.560
Yes.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I understand.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.596
I'll find
your wife's killer, Mr. Kimmel.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.837
I want you to be
reassured by that.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.160
I want you to know
there's no one smarter than me.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.033
"Nobody holds
a good opinion of a

14:16.200 --> 14:18.350
man who holds
a low opinion of himself."

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
Mark Twain.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.918
Same century, Mister...

14:24.200 --> 14:26.919
Corby, but it was
in fact, Anthony Trollope.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.273
I'll sleep easier, Detective,

14:32.440 --> 14:35.432
knowing a man of your
intelligence is on the case.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.434
I'll leave you to your
picnic, Mr. Kimmel.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.160
You know I have a job,
for God's sake.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.237
I can't just drop everything
every time you get sick!

15:09.800 --> 15:11.836
I can't take
much more of this, Mother.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.591
No, I have tried to tell you.
And you never listen. You never do!

15:19.120 --> 15:21.509
I can't promise.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.068
Walter has just got back.
I have to go.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.351
I have to go. Goodbye.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.669
Hi, Kits. You all right?

15:33.680 --> 15:34.999
Don't let her get to you.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.514
How's the lovely, Ellie?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.394
Why don't you spend the
rest of the evening with her?

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
That's right.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.189
Go to her.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.075
Get out.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.153
Just go to her.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.193
A Police Chief
told the press today

16:04.400 --> 16:06.550
they are still looking
for clues to the brutal killing

16:06.720 --> 16:09.029
of a woman now identified
as Helen Kimmel

16:09.200 --> 16:10.792
at Harry's Rainbow Grill.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.070
Investigations are continuing.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.108
Corby.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.914
The Helen Kimmel murder.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.599
It's bu ilding nicely.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
I can taste it.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.073
Kimmel has a strong alibi.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.640
We've already turned him over.
There's nothing there.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.113
That kid Tony Ricco
swears Kimmel was at the movies.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.469
He's in the clear.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.519
Hi there, Mr. Kimmel.
How's it going?

18:22.680 --> 18:23.874
It's going okay, thanks.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.553
That detective's
been here again.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.200
He keeps asking me
the same questions.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.193
Well, Tony, you just keep
giving him the same answer.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.438
I got you
a special treat today.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.913
You're spoiling me, Mr. K.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.957
It's all a question
of who you know...

18:40.960 --> 18:42.109
and who you trust.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.998
Hash browns with lots of onions.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.110
- And one of your frankfurters.
- You got it.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.792
And give me
some cheese with that.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.229
Sure thing Mr. K.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.519
And a big slice of that
chocolate banana cake.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.336
...still going on about this.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.874
I saw you.
Everyone saw you.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.793
Are you
out of your fucking...

19:10.000 --> 19:11.638
- mind.
- Ellie Briess. Ellie Briess.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.915
Don't dare deny it.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.479
It's not worth denying.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.312
I have... I have really tried.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.596
But you are making it
impossible for me.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.558
What the hell
happened to us? Did we...

19:23.800 --> 19:25.119
I guess we had one good year.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.634
Was that it? Was that
all we got? One good year?

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
Well? Was that it?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.309
Stop it! Stop shouting at me.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.869
Good night, Claudia.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.711
You married me
"in sickness and in health."

19:41.880 --> 19:42.630
Remember?

19:42.760 --> 19:44.830
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever happened to "health"?

19:48.800 --> 19:51.553
It's not my fault!
I can't help it.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.595
I promise. I promise. This
time I will go and see someone.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.756
I know I've said it so many
times, but believe me, Walter.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.115
- I will go and see someone.
- Calm down.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.796
- I promise I will.
- Sure, great idea. Go right ahead.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.518
For God's sakes, Clara,
don't be so melodramatic.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.029
Leave me alone!

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
All right.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.752
All right. I will.

20:49.920 --> 20:50.989
You're on your own!

20:51.920 --> 20:53.512
House is all yours tonight.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.518
Are you following this story?

21:03.400 --> 21:04.469
Not closely.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.555
I'd say he looks like
a man who murdered his wife.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.835
That's ridiculous.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.036
You can't tell that
just by looking at someone.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.359
Well, I'd say he did it.

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
I've worked it out.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.719
He followed her bus,

21:19.240 --> 21:21.071
lured her away from the stop,

21:22.720 --> 21:23.720
killed her.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.629
Simple as that.
Turned around and headed home.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.149
Left no clues.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.278
Seems he has a great alibi.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.069
He's real smart.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.400
Clara!

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Clara!

22:04.960 --> 22:05.960
Clara!

22:06.200 --> 22:08.236
Oh, for God's sake.
Open the door. Clara!

22:15.040 --> 22:18.828
Oh God no, no, no!
Clara! Clara!

22:19.800 --> 22:20.800
Clara!

22:25.800 --> 22:27.631
Clara. Come on, Clara.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.395
Clara, wake up.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.275
We'll pump her out.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.671
We should know in 48 hours.

22:53.960 --> 22:54.960
Walter?

22:55.840 --> 22:57.193
Who was she seeing?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.080
What?

22:59.120 --> 23:00.633
Her analyst, what's his name?

23:03.640 --> 23:04.640
I'm sorry.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.951
I couldn't persuade her
to see anyone.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.035
I tried.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.388
You should have tried harder.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.274
Dr. Palmer,
please dial the operator.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.630
Dr. Palmer,
please dial the operator.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.352
She took every god damn
pill in the house.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.039
I knew she was going to.
We'd had another fight.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.792
I stood my ground this time.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.069
I told her. I've fucking had it.
I didn't sign up for this.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.599
But at that moment I think
I really wanted her to.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.748
No, Walter,

23:50.800 --> 23:52.358
you're not thinking straight.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.240
Hi there.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
Remember me?

24:21.240 --> 24:23.834
Sure. Of course. Hi.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.592
Good to see you again. Come in.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.673
Some orchids. Lots of them.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.639
To thank Mrs. Stackhouse
for the party.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.156
She'll love them. Thanks.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.474
So, what brings you up here?

24:38.920 --> 24:42.071
Oh, you know, I like to get
out of the city on the weekend

24:42.240 --> 24:44.196
and just drive.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.156
Me and my car found ourselves
driving north, so...

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
Here I am.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.758
So your wife is at work?

24:53.480 --> 24:56.358
I remember you saying
that she worked on Saturdays.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.119
Yeah, it's her busiest day.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.354
She sells houses.
And I build them.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.558
So this is your design?

25:16.400 --> 25:17.674
How long have you lived here?

25:18.840 --> 25:22.230
We move in a year
after we got married.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
Yeah.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.668
How long ago was that?

25:27.480 --> 25:28.754
Four year ago now.

25:29.880 --> 25:30.880
Yeah.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.280
Kids?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.792
No. Not yet.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.475
I'm moving soon.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Oh?

25:42.800 --> 25:44.119
Still the Village,

25:44.400 --> 25:45.549
but a...

25:46.080 --> 25:47.433
little place of my own.

25:47.960 --> 25:48.960
Time to grow up.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.496
It's not all it's cracked up to be.
I wouldn't rush it.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.751
No, honestly.
I need to slow down.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.589
Packed a hell of a lot
in these past five years.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.910
Stop, you're making me jealous.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.839
Oh no. I'm not so sure.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.479
Grass is always greener.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
Well...

26:12.040 --> 26:13.040
I'd better get going.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.279
What'll you be doing tonight?

26:16.440 --> 26:17.440
Singing...

26:17.760 --> 26:20.832
at a little club
off MacDougal...

26:21.160 --> 26:22.195
called "Molly's."

26:23.240 --> 26:24.912
You should come along sometime.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.918
I'm there almost every night.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.795
Maybe one day I will.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.999
It was nice to see you.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.440
You too.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.595
I'll take a rye.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.633
Rye. Double. Neat.

Don't worry.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.431
Everyone thinks
you had a bad flu.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.829
Kind of a pneumonia.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
Thank you.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.472
I knew it's what you'd want, Kits.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.234
The orchids downstairs,
who brought them?

31:31.960 --> 31:33.075
Was it Betty?

31:34.240 --> 31:38.995
I completely forgot. Martha's
friend, Ellie, brought them.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.479
To thank you for the party.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.631
- How long did she stay?
- I don't know. Not very long.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.313
Long enough to fuck her?

31:53.240 --> 31:54.240
Oh, Clara.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.473
I was right, wasn't I?

31:57.600 --> 31:58.874
- Admit it.
- I can't...

31:59.040 --> 32:00.640
I can't have this
conversation right now.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.069
I'm going out.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.560
I will be back.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.200
I promise.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.915
But this can't go on.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.833
This has to end.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.230
Are you looking
for anything in particular?

34:10.880 --> 34:13.871
Yeah. I'm looking for a book
called "The Living City"

34:14.040 --> 34:15.313
by Frank Lloyd Wright.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.033
You happen to have it in stock?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.588
I'm sure I don't.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.190
As I thought, I don't have it.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.078
I do have a copy
of Lloyd Wright's

34:42.239 --> 34:43.797
"Disappearing City."

34:44.960 --> 34:45.995
I've got that.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.559
In fact,
I have a 1932 first edition.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.918
I could try to find it.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.676
Do you want me
to order it for you?

35:00.240 --> 35:02.959
Uh, yes. I would, thanks.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.308
Just fill in
your name and address.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.154
Do you own this bookstore?

35:33.600 --> 35:34.600
Yes.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.640
So you must be Marty Kimmel?

35:41.520 --> 35:42.635
What is it to you?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.470
I heard your wife died recently.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.474
She was murdered.

35:54.920 --> 35:55.955
Sorry.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.079
Have they found her killer?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
No.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.440
Well...

36:08.920 --> 36:10.672
I hope they find
the man who's guilty.

36:11.760 --> 36:12.760
So do I.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.755
Thank you for your concern.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.830
I'll be in touch
if I find that book.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.199
You shouldn't
be up this late.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.240
Neither should you.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.998
No doubt you had a couple
of scotches with Jon?

37:34.120 --> 37:39.240
Yeah. That's exactly what I did.
We needed to let off some steam.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.520
Where did you go?

37:43.800 --> 37:46.473
Some dive.
I don't remember the name.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.397
I followed you from the office.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
I saw you.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.240
With your whore.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.909
Ellie Briess.

38:12.440 --> 38:15.159
- I knew all along.
- No. You didn't.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.909
There's nothing to know.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.231
Don't think there's a future
in it because there isn't.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.952
I'm going to divorce you, Clara.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.069
I'm calling our lawyers.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.149
Do what you want.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.040
It's your life.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.119
If you divorce me,

39:23.800 --> 39:25.791
then I will kill myself.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.710
And everyone will know
it's your fault.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.795
And everyone
will blame you, Walter.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.478
There will be blood
on your hands.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.199
Mr. Stackhouse.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.000
I thought you were
with Mrs. Stackhouse

40:19.120 --> 40:21.031
seeing her off
at the bus station.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.159
What are you talking about?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.199
A telegram.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.074
Her mother.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.630
It seemed
very serious this time.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.669
She was aiming to catch
the 6:30 up to Saratoga.

40:46.680 --> 40:47.680
Watch it, mister.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.560
Clara!

40:52.080 --> 40:53.911
Why didn't you
tell me you're going away?

40:54.080 --> 40:56.036
Why should I make it
easier for you?

40:57.440 --> 40:59.874
It seems my mother
is really dying this time.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.350
So, you get to spend another
48 hours with Ellie Briess.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.079
Think that will make you happy?

41:10.040 --> 41:11.439
You don't look at all happy.

43:03.480 --> 43:06.392
Excuse me. How much time
do we have at this stop?

43:06.720 --> 43:07.869
Fifteen minutes.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.595
So they say.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.073
Oh, Mr. Stackhouse.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.079
I just received
a call from the hospital.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.268
To say that
Mrs. Stackhouse's mother

44:13.600 --> 44:15.158
died during the night.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.033
Oh, God.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Oh, no.

44:21.800 --> 44:24.189
Thanks Claudia. I'll call
Mrs. Stackhouse back right away.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.032
But she isn't there.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.591
She never arrived.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.679
- No. That's impossible.
- Oh, dear.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.240
Do you have the number of
the hospital? Who did you speak to?

44:34.280 --> 44:37.033
- You sure you got this right?
- I didn't make a mistake.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.599
I swear.

44:43.840 --> 44:44.875
Stackhouse residence.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.234
Is this Walter Stackhouse?

44:46.400 --> 44:47.230
Yes.

44:47.400 --> 44:48.833
My name is Detective Miller,

44:49.000 --> 44:50.718
Saratoga Springs
Police Department.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.760
I'm afraid we have something
we need to talk to you about.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.753
You okay, Mr. Stackhouse?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.360
Yeah.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.358
I'm afraid I still need to go
through a few things with you.

46:17.800 --> 46:18.915
Can you do this now?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.595
Sure.

46:22.200 --> 46:23.200
I think so.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.200
I'll be fine.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.640
What do you think happened?

46:37.360 --> 46:40.796
We're not sure, sir. She may
have taken her own life, she...

46:40.960 --> 46:42.712
She may
have been pushed, of course.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.120
How do you do? I'm detective
Lawrence Corby, homicide.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.838
Uh, Walter Stackhouse.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.634
I'm so sorry for your loss.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.476
I'll take over this now.
Just leave your notes.

47:00.640 --> 47:02.631
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

47:04.040 --> 47:05.712
Yesterday, at home.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.876
But I spoke to her
on the phone...

47:09.560 --> 47:11.790
from my office
before she caught the bus.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.718
Do you have reason to believe
your wife would commit suicide?

47:18.360 --> 47:20.715
Well, she's tried before,
I'm afraid to say.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.078
But I just can't imagine
Clara would jump off a bridge.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
Well.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.799
I've seen the bridge.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.791
It's not likely
that she slipped and fell.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.920
Well, I hope someone's going
to make some investigations.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.556
Don't worry, I will,
Mr. Stackhouse.

47:39.840 --> 47:40.840
When you left work,

47:40.880 --> 47:43.348
after speaking to your wife,
did you go straight home?

47:43.920 --> 47:44.920
Yes.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.079
Well, actually, no.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.309
Actually, I was trying
to reach a friend.

47:55.640 --> 47:56.959
I drove around for a while.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.319
Did you ever reach your friend?

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
Yes.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.714
I'll need his name and address.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.069
Ellie Briess,

48:08.880 --> 48:10.472
38 Cornelia Street,

48:11.000 --> 48:12.069
it's in the Village.

48:38.440 --> 48:39.714
So, they have my name?

48:43.040 --> 48:44.359
I hope they won't blame me.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.468
No. She always
had mental problems.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.232
Neurotic, jealous.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.919
Oh, hi Martha.

48:59.760 --> 49:00.954
Ah, Jesus.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.278
No. How awful.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.118
Poor Mr. Stackhouse.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.068
Do... do they know what happened?

49:15.440 --> 49:16.440
Yeah.

49:17.520 --> 49:18.520
Bye.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.710
I didn't think I should
tell Martha you were here.

49:38.600 --> 49:39.669
Good day, Mr. Kimmel.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.160
Walter Stackhouse.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.594
Walter Stackhouse.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.759
Walter Stackhouse.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.273
Walter Stackhouse.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.552
I'm not open today. I'm sorry.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
It's me.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.154
Detective Corby.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.399
I think we need to talk.

50:18.240 --> 50:19.896
Did you read a story
in today's local paper

50:19.920 --> 50:21.911
about a woman who
died at Harry's Rainbow Grill?

50:24.320 --> 50:26.356
Yes, I did in fact.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.676
A bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

50:29.360 --> 50:30.679
What are you saying?

50:32.440 --> 50:33.440
Well...

50:33.680 --> 50:34.680
Your wife...

50:35.240 --> 50:36.240
And now some other...

50:36.960 --> 50:38.075
poor man's wife.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.708
What was his name?

50:40.040 --> 50:41.189
I have no idea.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.078
The paper said it
was a suicide most...

50:43.240 --> 50:45.674
The husband's name
was Stackhouse.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.595
Walter Stackhouse.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.554
He's under investigation.

50:54.600 --> 50:55.874
Just like you are, Mr. Kimmel.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.673
Statistics tend to make me
suspicious of husbands.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.159
And I love statistics.

51:07.600 --> 51:10.910
What specifically did you
want to ask me, detective?

51:12.040 --> 51:13.040
You know.

51:13.600 --> 51:16.478
I've been going over your
wife's case again and again.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.794
Your movie alibi...

51:20.960 --> 51:22.188
it bothers me.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.955
Anthony has given his statement.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.037
Anthony Ricco...

51:32.960 --> 51:34.359
seventeen...

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
young...

51:37.160 --> 51:39.435
I'm talking to him regularly.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.318
All your colleagues know
me very well, detective.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.593
So I believe, and I wanna
get to know you better myself.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.356
You know.
We've got a lot in common.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.799
My family comes from Newark.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.914
We can't let your wife's killer
get away with it, can we?

52:05.400 --> 52:06.879
I'll be in touch again soon.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.192
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Kimmel.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.200
Hello?

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
Tony?

52:35.760 --> 52:38.149
You wanna come over
for some beers this evening?

53:32.040 --> 53:33.234
It was her choice.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
Wasn't it?

53:36.880 --> 53:38.108
Of course it was.

53:39.080 --> 53:42.197
You can't blame yourself.
I mean, you tried everything.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.919
Did I? Did I really?

53:46.400 --> 53:48.360
What's the difference
between wishing someone dead

53:48.520 --> 53:50.511
and actually
doing something about it?

53:52.600 --> 53:53.828
One hell of a difference.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.995
- What are you talking about?
- No, uh...

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
I don't know.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.753
I honestly don't know anymore.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.680
Morning, Claudia.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
I'm sorry.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.753
I don't want to
work here anymore,

55:02.920 --> 55:03.955
Mr. Stackhouse.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.719
I've come
to collect a few things.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.598
There's no reason
for you to leave.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.400
Okay.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.680
I understand.

55:14.360 --> 55:16.590
If that's the way
you prefer to handle things.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.353
I don't want anything.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.992
I'm sorry, Mr. Stackhouse.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
Truly.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.800
Mr. Stackhouse,

55:50.840 --> 55:51.840
please have a seat.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.434
This is Mr. De Vries.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.672
Have you ever met
Mr. De Vries before?

56:08.040 --> 56:09.837
I don't think so. No.

56:10.880 --> 56:11.915
Well?

56:12.200 --> 56:13.633
Yeah. That's him.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.674
I never forget a face.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.600
That's him.

56:19.320 --> 56:21.440
- Everyone I know always says...
- That's fine.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.236
Thank you, Mr. De Vries.
You can go now.

56:29.880 --> 56:30.880
So.

56:31.400 --> 56:34.153
Mr. De Vries says he spoke
to you at Harry's Rainbow Grill.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.318
You asked him
how long the bus stopped,

56:37.480 --> 56:38.595
the night your wife died.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.634
Yes, I was there.

56:44.680 --> 56:45.874
I...

56:46.760 --> 56:47.954
followed the bus.

56:48.600 --> 56:49.999
I wanted to talk to Clara.

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
And did you?

56:53.280 --> 56:55.350
No. I couldn't find her.
I looked everywhere.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.559
Why didn't you tell us this?

57:02.920 --> 57:04.990
Thought she got off
at one of the other stops

57:05.160 --> 57:06.160
on the way.

57:06.520 --> 57:07.669
Had some other plan.

57:08.640 --> 57:11.200
So, your story about
driving around, was...

57:11.400 --> 57:13.356
Yes. It was very stupid of me.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.389
I should have told you.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.360
Well.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.155
You better tell me now.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.070
Exactly what did happen?
Cigarette?

57:28.360 --> 57:29.360
Well.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.560
I felt...

57:32.200 --> 57:33.599
I felt we had to
finish something.

57:33.800 --> 57:34.835
You'd been arguing?

57:36.840 --> 57:37.840
No.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.670
Just a question
of finishing something...

57:44.080 --> 57:45.752
important
that we were discussing.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.278
Were you
and Mrs. Stackhouse happy?

57:53.360 --> 57:54.839
Actually,
we were getting a divorce.

57:59.400 --> 58:00.753
Did you both want this divorce?

58:01.080 --> 58:02.720
In all honesty,
she didn't want a divorce,

58:02.760 --> 58:04.557
but she knew there was
nothing she could do

58:04.720 --> 58:06.836
- to stop me from getting one.
- Seems she tried.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.200
I followed up on those
previous attempts that she made.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.956
Can you prove suicide
in this sort of case?

58:13.640 --> 58:15.915
Coming off a bridge that high,
with so many injuries,

58:16.080 --> 58:17.274
it's hard to get a consensus.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.680
But I just like to eliminate
all the other possibilities.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.800
One more thing.

58:26.160 --> 58:28.151
Did you ever hear about
another woman's body found

58:28.320 --> 58:29.753
near Harry's Rainbow Grill?

58:30.640 --> 58:32.232
It happened not too long ago.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.949
She was badly beaten.

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
Knifed.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.512
She was definitely murdered.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.477
No. I didn't.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.600
Kimmel.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.909
Helen Kimmel.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
No.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.673
I'm working that case too.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.512
I haven't found the killer yet.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
Well.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.639
Thank you very much for coming
in. I'll be in touch soon.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.036
Where are those martinis?

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
Coming right up.

59:31.240 --> 59:32.468
You ever been to Paris?

59:32.960 --> 59:34.837
Of course. Have you?

59:35.840 --> 59:36.840
No. I haven't.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.991
All architects
ought to go to Paris.

59:39.920 --> 59:42.115
- And all writers have to go...
- I know.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.238
Somehow I never
got around to it.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.240
Well.

59:48.960 --> 59:49.995
It's still there.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.636
It's that
goddamn detective Corby.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560
Um.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.915
You know.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.638
Maybe it's better
if you weren't around.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:12.790
Just come with me.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.600
Let's go downstairs.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200
Okay.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
He won't stay long.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480
This is weird.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.416
Good evening, Mr. Stackhouse.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.016
Sorry it's a bit late,
but do you have a moment?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.234
Yeah. Come on in.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.038
I've interrupted you.
I can only apologize

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.030
yet again.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.736
What did you want to
talk to me about?

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.875
I talked to Kimmel.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.511
- Kimmel?
- The man whose wife was murdered

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.994
at Harry's Rainbow Grill.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.038
- Oh. Yes.
- I'm convinced he's guilty.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760
So why tell me? I've...

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.151
Everyone thinks it was some
sort of random maniac. But...

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.914
You've given me ideas.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.234
Is this house your own design?

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280
Very...

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360
adult.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.236
Would you be willing
to show me around?

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520
Sure.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.429
Let's start back here.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.996
What's downstairs?

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600
Just my den.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.869
May I? I'd like to
complete the picture.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600
Nice.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760
I like this.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.360
What's this?

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.033
It's a kind of scrapbook.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.795
Ideas. Pictures and things I
cut out of newspapers, you know?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.591
They're my clippings.
Crazy stuff.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.028
Inspirations for my
short stories that I write.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.999
Maybe one day
I'll write a novel.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160
Who knows.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.717
Quite a hobby.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.554
This is about Kimmel.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
Is it?

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200
My God.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.160
You cut it out?

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.079
I must have. I don't remember.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.117
I've hundreds of cuttings
of all sorts.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.955
I just cut things out.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.995
You've never actually
met Kimmel? Have you?

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.317
Me? Kimmel? God no.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.869
This doesn't look too good
for you, Mr. Stackhouse.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040
I don't like it.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.639
I followed
Clara's bus to the rest stop.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.755
I waited...

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.959
looking all over for her
till the bus left.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.953
And then I came home.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.834
So you...

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.839
knew she was missing and...

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.279
when you came to see me?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600
And later we...

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.200
Well, I couldn't understand it.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.559
When she didn't get back on,

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.517
I thought maybe she'd
gotten off earlier.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.389
Anyway. It was stupid of me.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.719
She might have had
some crazy plan.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.239
She knew where you lived.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.397
She'd followed me there before.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760
The trouble is...

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360
I was seen...

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:37.869
at the rest stop.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.919
They might try to make
something of it. That's all.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.709
Make something of it?

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.240
What are you talking about?

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.839
What are they
gonna make of it?

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.639
- Walter, you're scaring me.
- No, don't be scared.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.634
I haven't done anything.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.428
But it could seem strange
that I followed her bus.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.753
I don't know why I did it.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.109
What will seem strange

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.350
is that you didn't tell
the police right away.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.034
You told a stupid lie.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.879
You panicked. Pure and simple.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.280
Big deal.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.912
You were in shock,
for God's sake.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200
Yeah.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.994
I reckon once they check out
Clara's history it'll be over.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.548
So just relax.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.439
Though it might not be
a bad idea to get an attorney.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280
No. I...

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.036
No.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.310
That'd make it look like
I have something to hide.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.993
Ellie, can I get you a drink?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.877
No. I have to go.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.388
I have to get up early.
Call me later. Bye Jon.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.833
I know what you're thinking.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.994
Ellie complicates things.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.595
Well, yes.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.839
Until this blows over, I'd keep
Ellie right out of the picture.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.592
I've got one
lying bastard and one...

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.555
No. Make that
two lying bastards.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.119
Both killed their wives.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.355
I know it.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.717
I'm watching them. Close.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.914
Look. Stackhouse is
a classic copycat killer.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.150
And Kimmel is a psychopath.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.674
His wife was in the way.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.474
We need more than
your textbook theories, Corby.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.520
And I'll give you a lot
more than that, Captain.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.080
I don't think it's gonna
be long until I nail this.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.913
Did you know Mrs. Stackhouse?

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.389
I only met her once.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.079
Look, this isn't the best
time for me to talk to you.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.795
And I don't like you
touching my things, okay?

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.875
I have rehearsal this morning.
I need to be there.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160
Well.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.231
I'm gonna have to
delay you, Ms. Briess.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.515
See, I'm a bit confused.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.856
Your "friend", Mr. Stackhouse,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.576
lied about where he was
the night his wife died

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.794
and now he's lied again.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.515
Not that long ago

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.998
another woman's body was found
murdered at the same rest stop.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.056
Now, Mr. Stackhouse told me
he'd never heard about it.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.559
But guess what? He had.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.195
I don't understand.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.751
He's got a newspaper clipping
in his scrapbook

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.148
all about the case.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.395
This is it.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.032
I appreciate your cooperation.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640
I'm back.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.680
And I've brought
someone with me.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.520
Mr. Kimmel,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.474
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Stackhouse.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.269
How do you do?

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
I'm good.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
How are you?

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.273
You two have a lot in common.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.232
This is your chance
to commiserate.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.908
A strange thing...

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.399
Mr. Stackhouse was so interested
in the death of your wife,

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.836
that he cut this out
and put it in his scrapbook.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.359
Now why do you think
he would do a thing like that?

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:31.479
Hmmm?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.475
I have no idea.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.434
You should ask him.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:43.156
I've already told you,
I cut out hundreds of things.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.194
I write stories.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.636
Do you have any particular

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.676
literary interests,
Mr. Stackhouse?

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.868
I'm always interested
in rare architecture books.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.991
You should browse our shelves.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:03.992
I have a substantial collection.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880
I was right.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:10.712
Common ground indeed.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.272
And why shouldn't there be?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:16.910
Kimmel...

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.671
you're a fucking liar!

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.750
You thought you were
home and dry. Admit it.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.792
This guy, Stackhouse...

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.515
He threw a wrench
in your works, all right.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.029
I don't know what you're
talking about, Detective.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.835
Are we through?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040
Yeah.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200
For today.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.320
Good bye.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.397
This is just too much!

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.949
Why, for God's sakes, go look at
a guy whose wife was murdered?

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.630
Just look at me and swear
to me you didn't do anything.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.598
- You have to ask me that?
- I just want you to swear.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.797
I did not kill Clara!

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.749
I don't know how this
has gotten so out of hand.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.028
I can't get something
you said out of my mind.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.553
What? Tell me. What?

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.834
"I have this fantasy
she's no longer there."

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.277
Is that the real
reason you lied?

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.153
Because you were thinking
about it all the time.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.789
You were thinking about it
long before you met me.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840
Tony.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
Please.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.680
Excuse me, sir.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.275
What do you want?

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.475
I wanna say thanks.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.632
Whatever you did,
I want you to know that...

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.235
It doesn't matter to me.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.829
I'm not guilty.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.636
- Did it never cross your mind?
- No.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.719
But it obviously crossed yours.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.915
But... I...

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.073
I didn't actually do it.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.470
- But I feel...
- What do you feel?

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.796
I don't know.
I guess in some way that

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.155
we have something in common.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.873
No. We have nothing in common.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.314
We're all guilty of something.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.598
I feel you are my guilt.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.072
And what the hell
does that mean?

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.478
It means I share in your guilt.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.832
I may have
thought about it, but...

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.355
but you did it.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.874
Get out of here.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.676
Do you realize
what you're doing to me?

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.480
You're ruining my life.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.433
I can never tell when that cop
is gonna walk through that door.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.988
I detest you.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.788
Get out of my shop.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.674
- Now.
- I'm sorry.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.468
I really am.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.239
You okay, Mr. Kimmel?

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.033
That man pestering you?
Who is he?

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.549
Don't you worry.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.309
I deal with customers
like him all the time.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.828
He's a nobody.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Yes!

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680
He was here.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.400
So what?

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.432
And what did he have to say?

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.316
He said he was sorry
he brought the police down

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.357
on the head of
an innocent man.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.028
Yeah? And what did you do?
Discuss architecture?

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.078
We're both innocent men.
In a similar situation.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.029
Pursued by a man
who invents crimes.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.872
You're a sad bitch, Kimmel.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.508
Did you murder her for the

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.070
simple reason that you thought
that you married beneath you?

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.520
For that simple reason?
Who would believe it?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.152
Well. You know what?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880
I do.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.189
A man of your intellect.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.631
How did you ever
let that happen?

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.953
She was always bugging you
with her inane chatter.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.229
So, you...

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.428
You got rid of her.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.268
But you never reckoned
on Stackhouse, did you?

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.795
Now, admit...

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.358
that you know he's guilty
and you're as guilty as he is.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.040
Admit it.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.880
Is everything okay,
Mr. Kimmel?

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.953
Mr. Kimmel? You all right?

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.749
That's all for today.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.068
See you tomorrow.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.273
Corby is obsessed with me.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.635
You should see him.
He's eaten up. He's uh...

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.480
He's got it in his twisted
little mind that I killed Clara.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.760
But Jesus!

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.878
To a lot of people
around here...

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.389
certain things do seem
a little hard to figure out.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.194
People can go to hell.
I'm through with it.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.878
Maybe you should think about
taking some time out. You know?

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.235
Some sick leave.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.749
Sick leave?

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.995
What are you saying?

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.955
Well, I thought you must need
some time to yourself.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080
Oh.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.033
You thought that, did you?

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.359
Well, thanks a lot, Jon.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.034
Tony, open the door.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.799
- Open up!
- Leave me alone.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.109
I can explain.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.716
Just five minutes.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.393
I'm calling the cops.
Go away.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.798
You just give me five minutes.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Please.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.278
That's all I ask. Five.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.513
Open the door.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.678
A Mr. Schaeffer
is here to see you.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.193
He says he has an appointment.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.398
That's fine Martha. Send him in.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.789
What are you doing here?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.155
I think you owe me.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.879
Corby knows you came
to see me, but I said nothing.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.591
I didn't even give him this.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.391
I think detective Corby might
just make something of this.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.038
Your little visit to your
favorite bookstore in Newark.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.595
I want money.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.276
A discreet arrangement
between you and me.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.751
A serious way of saying sorry.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.116
I'm not giving you
a fucking cent.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.678
I can make you look very guilty.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.236
No, you can't.
I haven't done anything.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.433
You can't prove anything.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.638
Proof is not the key thing.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.915
It's doubt.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.994
Doubt is everything.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320
You should know that.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.679
I'll keep this safe.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.668
Until I hear from you.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.795
Detective Corby!

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.509
Detective Corby!

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.033
Mr. Stackhouse.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.279
I need to talk to you.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.514
I went to see Kimmel.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.920
I know. We've been
watching the shop.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.077
No. I didn't mean
the other day. I went before.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.438
I went before Clara died.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.318
I went
to his bookstore in Newark.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.955
I ordered a book...

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.354
I left my name and address.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.314
Jesus Christ.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.828
Boy, I'm impressed.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.756
Can you tell a lie?
Why did you go there?

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.868
I wanted to see Kimmel.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.280
Why? I don't get it.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.948
Well, I know it sounds crazy,
but I wanted to see...

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.597
if he looked like a man
who could murder his wife.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.070
It... fascinated me.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.553
It fascinated you?

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560
Yeah.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.678
I'm a writer, remember?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.875
As far as excuses go,
that one doesn't fly.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.599
So, why are you telling me?

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.796
Well, he's got
my dated order slip.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.316
He just tried to blackmail me.
It's laughable.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.069
No. It's interesting.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.800
Well, it's a little
private transaction. I...

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.751
But I feel better
now that you know.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.354
I wanted to tell you in case
he comes to you with some

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.879
fantastical story.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.470
He won't need to use
too much imagination.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.950
- I didn't do anything.
- So you keep saying.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.350
What's the next revelation
gonna be, Mr. Stackhouse?

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.476
I'm just watching you
digging your grave

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.392
and it's getting
deeper and deeper.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.475
If you wanna press charges,
feel free.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.320
This young man
wants to change his statement.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.076
You fucked up trying
to blackmail Stackhouse

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.878
with that order slip,
didn't you?

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.229
Big mistake.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.353
I don't know
what you're getting at.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.358
You get nailed.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.313
I'm getting closer
and you know it.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.515
He gets away with murder.
That's what I'm getting at.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.354
You gotta face it.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.235
He's got the cute blonde
to replace his wife.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.751
His smart friends,
his neighbors.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.120
Oh, yeah.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.558
And he's stinking rich.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.159
As for you Kimmel...

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.480
Well...

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.274
The luck is just not
on your side now, is it?

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.950
I couldn't care less
about Stackhouse.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.677
Amazing, though,
isn't it?

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.076
Looks like he can actually
get away with it.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.712
Scott free.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.919
I told you I don't care.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080
But...

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.394
Your alibi is falling apart.
Could be death row for you

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.551
while he's out there,
living the good life.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.558
You're not gonna
get away with it.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.230
Stackhouse
is your problem, Kimmel.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.311
Back on the bus
in 15 minutes.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.913
- Helen!
- Marty!

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.599
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.479
I got something for you.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.960
You drive up here at night

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.992
without any warning... Who the hell
do you think you are? Look at you.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.116
I told you to throw
that ugly jacket out.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.032
My friends think
you look like a hobo.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.200
I can never ask...

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.238
If you divorce me...

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.952
then I will kill myself.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.038
Do what you want.
It's your life.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.189
Go right ahead.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320
Go.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.556
I've got a Jackson
following Stackhouse.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.711
Kimmel's taken
the bait, all right.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.915
Let's stick with him.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.553
He's lost control.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.673
What do you think he's gonna do?

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.995
I don't know.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.431
But I know what I hope
he's gonna do.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.992
Why didn't Stackhouse
take a cab?

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.696
Where the fuck is he going?
How much further is he going?

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.757
I don't care. As long as
I have a ringside seat.

Stackhouse! You blunderer!

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920
I did it.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.040
Police! Drop it!

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.873
- Jesus Christ.
- What a mess.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.799
I have this fantasy.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.430
I have this...
I have this fantasy.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.478
That she's no longer there.
I haven 't done anything.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.359
I didn't set out
to tell such stupid lies.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.590
I wanted to see if he
looked like a man

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.949
who murdered his wife.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.918
Wishing someone dead.
It's fascinating.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.917
I haven 't done anything wrong.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.719
We 're all guilty of something.
I'm a writer.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.793
I write stories.
