WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
Previously onSWAT...Is Jim Street single?

00:10.314 --> 00:12.969
Aren't you worried it could get
a little messy with your dad?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.145
Maybe if I was 16 and it was
still any of his business.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.929
So you-you want me to find out?

00:16.973 --> 00:18.061
Are you still off
the dating apps?

00:18.105 --> 00:19.845
Oh, I'm done with the hustle.

00:19.889 --> 00:22.892
I'm just gonna let life
come to me from now on.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
Now, imagine these culinary
treats could come to you

00:24.589 --> 00:25.851
wherever you are...

00:25.895 --> 00:26.939
Like a delivery service.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.419
No, better.
Food truck.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.552
This could be, like,
a team investment, man.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.858
Do you remember the day
your father left us?

00:32.902 --> 00:36.166
And you went running down
the street after him, crying.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.646
DOCTOR:
The X-rays we did
on your lungs

00:37.689 --> 00:39.082
show an abnormal mass
right here.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
So lung cancer.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.216
DOCTOR: I want to do
a biopsy immediately.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.131
DANIEL:
I ain't doing no operation.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.046
If you don't want to get
that biopsy, it's your life.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.309
Don't let it be because you
think you deserve this cancer,

00:48.352 --> 00:49.484
'cause, Pop, you don't.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.094
I got a daughter
who I miss every day,

00:51.138 --> 00:52.313
and she won't even
speak to me.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.575
I just don't feel like
fighting anymore.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.011
HONDO:
I get Winnie to sit down

00:55.055 --> 00:56.099
with you after 30 years,

00:56.143 --> 00:57.318
then you get that biopsy.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.059
Is that a deal?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.932
♪

01:10.853 --> 01:12.159
HONDO:
Give me all your money!Oh...!

01:12.202 --> 01:14.422
[both laughing]Hondo.

01:14.465 --> 01:17.120
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.775
What are you doing in Vegas?
You got a work thing here?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.255
I can't just come visit
my big sister?

01:21.298 --> 01:23.083
Well, sure you can.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.997
You gonna stand there,
or you gonna give me a hug?

01:25.041 --> 01:27.087
Oh, whoa, whoa, how about
we wait till you take a shower?How about no?

01:27.130 --> 01:28.784
No. Come here.I'm just-- Oh, come on. Oh.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.133
Ooh, ooh, okay.[laughing]

01:30.177 --> 01:31.569
Okay, that's enough,
that's enough.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.093
Now, girl, you know better.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.399
You can't be out here
jogging in earbuds.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.705
Somebody could
come up behind you.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.141
What if I was
really a mugger?

01:38.185 --> 01:40.274
Then I would've
whupped your ass.
[laughs]

01:40.317 --> 01:41.840
You mean drown me
in your sweat maybe.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.104
[laughs]
It's Vegas. It's the desert.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.628
And this body is not gonna stay
in shape by itself anymore.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.717
Yeah, I see.[both laugh]

01:48.760 --> 01:50.153
Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
I would've got the
spare room ready.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.157
I left you a couple of messages.
You never hit me back.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.638
You know, between my... my
work schedule at the casino

01:56.681 --> 01:58.292
and your saving the world,

01:58.335 --> 02:00.207
I didn't know when we'd
both be awake to talk.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.733
You're not here to
lose money on blackjack

02:04.776 --> 02:07.170
or for brother/sister
hang time, are you?

02:07.214 --> 02:09.694
Wish I was.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.957
Look, if this is about Dad,
I don't want to hear it.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.481
Winnie, it is about Dad.

02:13.524 --> 02:14.960
No.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.397
He really needs
to see you.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
No.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.401
He's about to have
surgery, Winnie.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.054
For what?

02:23.621 --> 02:25.319
Cancer.

02:25.362 --> 02:28.235
Now, they still got to do
a biopsy to see how bad it is,

02:28.278 --> 02:29.758
but Pops has cancer.

02:29.801 --> 02:33.022
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.155
I am, but...

02:35.198 --> 02:37.374
but he's got
another daughter.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.159
With a different mother,

02:39.202 --> 02:41.161
who he poured all
his love into.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.033
She can do the
hand holding now.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
He's got regrets.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
Enough regrets
that he doesn't think

02:47.428 --> 02:48.994
he deserves to beat this thing.

02:49.038 --> 02:52.346
Well, maybe he doesn't.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.217
Come on, Winnie,
just hear me out.[groans]

02:54.261 --> 02:56.611
Please.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.613
Look, the man is stubborn.

02:58.656 --> 03:01.398
We know where
you got it from, at least.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.226
Look, I'm not here
to cause you any grief.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.185
And you ain't got
no obligations.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.186
But he's scared.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.884
He's really scared.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.277
He only agreed to the biopsy

03:10.320 --> 03:12.192
if I was able to bring
the family back together.

03:12.235 --> 03:16.108
See, that's not fair, Hondo.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.328
You and I made a pact, remember?

03:18.372 --> 03:19.460
When he abandoned us.

03:19.503 --> 03:22.071
Yes, abandoned us

03:22.114 --> 03:25.335
and Mom
to start some new family.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.382
You and I swore we were never
gonna talk to him again.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.340
That was a long time ago.
We were kids.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.864
Well, I kept my promise
for 30 years.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.649
Why should I break it now?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.216
Because this might be
your only chance

03:36.259 --> 03:38.130
to get all this
off your chest to him.

03:38.174 --> 03:42.222
And because I'm not asking you
to forgive him, just see him.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.923
And because I am here
asking you to.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.448
I got to go to work tomorrow.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.798
The casino would shut down
if you called in sick

03:53.842 --> 03:55.365
for just a couple of days?

04:01.415 --> 04:02.981
LUCA:
Come and get it!

04:03.025 --> 04:05.767
Who said there's no such thing
as a free lunch?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.595
Make the most of it.

04:07.638 --> 04:10.075
Pretty soon, you're gonna have
to pay full freight for it.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.600
Hey. Where are you two
headed looking so fly?

04:12.643 --> 04:14.645
Protective detail on the
governor. Routine stuff.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.038
She's moderating a
human rights conference.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.258
I actually want to see
a couple of the speakers,

04:18.301 --> 04:20.042
especially Amina Abadi.Hey, we still got

04:20.085 --> 04:21.043
investment opportunities
in the food truck,

04:21.086 --> 04:22.044
if you're interested.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.263
Yeah? How much?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.352
Five grand a share.
It's a total steal, man.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.092
Five thousand?Yeah.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.833
You could book a surfing
trip to Hawaii for that.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.313
LUCA:
Taste this and
you'll be happy

04:30.357 --> 04:31.836
going camping in
your backyard, man.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.447
TAN:
Yo, I thought we had
enough investors.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.013
No offense, Rocker.

04:35.057 --> 04:38.060
Yeah, didn't we all
put in together, like, 30 grand?

04:38.103 --> 04:39.322
Yeah, I figure
with five grand more,

04:39.366 --> 04:40.454
we can get those
top-of-the-line broilers

04:40.497 --> 04:42.847
to go with that oven
that Tan kicked in.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.458
Increase our profits
by, like, 15%.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.895
Okay, and did you run this by
everyone who owns a stake?

04:46.938 --> 04:48.331
I thought you trusted me.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.506
Come on, this is
gonna be awesome.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.899
I just bought the vehicle.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.596
A little outfitting,
and we are gonna take

04:52.640 --> 04:54.511
the L.A. food truck scene
by storm, man.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.733
You ever, uh, done
an escape room?

04:58.776 --> 05:01.605
Uh, in real life, sure,
couple times.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
Never recreationally.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.739
A new one just
opened up in Venice.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.349
A few friends and I
are going later.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.829
Could use an
extra player.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.919
And, uh, no SWAT skills
necessary, just your brain.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.964
Oh, so we don't
use our brains on SWAT?

05:13.008 --> 05:15.271
[chuckles] No, that's
not what I meant.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
You want to come?

05:16.359 --> 05:18.187
Tonight?
Yeah.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.362
Uh, yeah. Sure.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.059
Okay, I'll text you
the address.
Okay.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.322
See you there.
Yeah.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.107
Hey, what's happening
with Molly?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.891
Oh, we're meeting up later.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.806
We're gonna do this
escape room thing.Oh, like a date?

05:28.850 --> 05:30.330
No, no, her friends
are gonna be there.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.070
You sure the boss's daughter
doesn't think it's a date?

05:32.114 --> 05:33.376
You better find
out quick, playa.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.986
All right, we got
to go. Come on.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, those are
for potential investors.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.514
Hey, minimum five grand
investment, okay?

05:40.557 --> 05:42.342
Gonna see profits
in, like, six months.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.303
What, do they think this is
a salvage yard or something?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.131
Hey, that's our baby!

05:51.263 --> 05:52.917
I'm thinking of naming her
Wilhelmena.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.052
Luca, is this the food truck
we invested in?

05:57.095 --> 05:59.141
Look, I said she'd need
a little outfitting,

05:59.184 --> 06:00.925
but I got her for a steal
at the police auction.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.319
You paid real money for this?[Luca laughs]

06:03.363 --> 06:04.973
Why'd the cops impound it?

06:05.016 --> 06:06.409
Oh, let's just say that

06:06.453 --> 06:08.585
they were selling more than
soft serve out of here.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.108
What, selling weed?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.501
Coke?

06:11.545 --> 06:13.068
Meth.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.156
Were they cooking meth
in here?

06:14.199 --> 06:15.157
Look, that's all in the past.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.637
All right?
A little cleanup,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.769
and Wilhelmena is gonna be
the best thing to happen

06:18.813 --> 06:20.771
to our profit margins,
trust me.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.382
No cook here.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.601
Oh, no, not right now, but wait
till I get it cleaned up.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.211
Hey, where you going, man?

06:26.255 --> 06:28.388
I thought you were gonna invest.Nice try.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.389
Rocker!

06:30.999 --> 06:32.522
All right. [laughs]

06:32.566 --> 06:34.568
Man, you're missing out.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.528
AMINA ABADI:
I'm so honored to be here

06:38.572 --> 06:40.138
to share my story.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.531
A year ago,

06:41.575 --> 06:44.186
men came to my home
in the middle of the night

06:44.229 --> 06:45.448
and took me away.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
I was imprisoned
for five months,

06:47.581 --> 06:51.193
with no access
to my family or a lawyer.

06:51.236 --> 06:55.676
I was beaten,
flogged, sexually abused,

06:55.719 --> 06:57.808
held in solitary confinement.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.245
Oh, my God.What was my crime?

07:00.289 --> 07:03.379
Along with five friends,
I had dared to protest

07:03.423 --> 07:05.860
the human rights abuses
in my country,

07:05.903 --> 07:08.471
as well as the lack
of equal rights for women.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.777
I've been following her story.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.735
She escaped from prison
by dressing as a guard.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.129
Eventually crossed the border
and applied for asylum.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.478
Brave woman.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.350
I'm here today to speak
on behalf of my friends,

07:18.394 --> 07:20.265
who are still in prison
back home,

07:20.309 --> 07:23.486
and to ask you to join me
in calling for their release,

07:23.530 --> 07:25.706
as well as an end to the torture

07:25.749 --> 07:28.143
of innocent people
whose only crime

07:28.186 --> 07:32.495
is seeking equality,
justice and freedom.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
[crowd cheering]

07:34.062 --> 07:35.542
Shukrun.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.414
WOMAN:
Keep up the good work!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.851
That was a great speech.Thank you.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.593
Still getting used to
speaking in public.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.900
And, honestly, I don't know
what good it will do.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.511
They'll listen.
They have to.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.208
I love my country.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.036
The West has the
wrong idea of it.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.125
Many of the people
are kind and generous.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.605
It's only a
small minority

07:55.649 --> 07:58.303
who are closed-minded
and prejudiced.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.176
But many of them are in power
and do not listen to women.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.744
Route's clear.
Let's go.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.962
GOVERNOR:
...delighted to be here today,

08:05.006 --> 08:07.269
lending our voice
and our support

08:07.312 --> 08:09.663
to the vital work
of human rights campaigners,

08:09.706 --> 08:12.883
both internationally
and locally, who continue

08:12.927 --> 08:14.406
the fight for equality.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.887
Got movement. Your two.
Black cap.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.063
Looks like he
might be armed.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.457
Stay with the governor.
All perimeter units, male, 30s,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.241

that the bullet

was tampered with.

nonlethal rounds?

16:26.202 --> 16:28.378
No, they were lethal. The
bullets fired at the conference

were all normal 6.8s.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.164
Every single one of them
should have been deadly,

16:31.207 --> 16:32.513

above head height.

They weren't aiming
to kill anyone.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.299

was tampered with.

Uh, no.

Christopher Wardlow.

Should I know him?He's a property tycoon.

He's behind that new office
building near Skid Row

arthritic pickle.

in Amina's homeland

18:27.758 --> 18:29.499
that's currently stalled.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.022
Wardlow's trying to grease palms
with the royal family

18:31.066 --> 18:32.894
by offering Amina
in the place of cash?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.678
That'd be pretty evil.DEACON: Yeah, but it
could be a way

18:34.722 --> 18:36.332
to get his hotel project
back on track.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.378
What are we waiting for?
Where's this guy Wardlow live?

20:57.995 --> 20:59.736
Wasn't a kidnapping.

It was staged.
It was a hoax.

What? Why?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.395
Amina was in danger.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.050
We thought a fake
kidnapping would...

21:09.093 --> 21:11.922
throw a spotlight on
her friends in jail.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.490
So she could get away.Amina was in on it?

21:14.534 --> 21:16.318

What exactly was your plan?

Fly her to safety.

who these guys are yet?No.

How'd the bad guys know
Wardlow was helping Amina?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.815
I'm guessing they bugged
her phone and her e-mails.

before they
put him under.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.450
It turns out he's business

22:44.493 --> 22:46.016

They've been dating six months.
He flew into LAX this morning.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.248
Is there any reason
to think he'd betray her?

23:00.291 --> 23:02.424
Well, his credit card
statement shows he just spent

23:02.468 --> 23:04.383
four months' salary on
a two-carat diamond ring

23:04.426 --> 23:06.297
from Tiffany's, so
I'm thinking not.

23:06.341 --> 23:08.430
I think he was planning
to escape with her.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.171
Think I got something.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.173
Kareem, or someone
using his credit card,

23:12.216 --> 23:14.523
rented a car close to the
airfield about 20 minutes ago.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.395
Okay, they'll have
a tracker in that car.

So, that's Amina's
boyfriend?

23:54.955 --> 23:56.435
Yeah. Heard he's refusing
to speak.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.175
Why?Well, he probably thinks

23:58.219 --> 23:59.525
he's protecting her
by keeping quiet.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.614
So he rented the car
to create a diversion,

24:01.657 --> 24:02.919
thinking the bad guys
would follow him,

24:02.963 --> 24:05.269

chance to escape.

right?

would hear her.

But what if it doesn't?
What if it's all for nothing?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.643
She stood up for her friends,

cost her everything.

just told me.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.605
She's an incredible woman.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.346
I guess you don't need
me telling you that.

You need to tell me
where she is.

25:31.921 --> 25:35.621
I promised her I wouldn't
betray her to anyone, ever.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.971
Even one person knowing
is one too many.

But we left before they arrived.

I made sure of it.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.508
We had a plan.

25:55.554 --> 26:00.907
I know that Amina escaped
from prison back home.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.997
I know that she's brave.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.694
I know that you want to
believe that she's managing

26:05.738 --> 26:07.522
on her own out there,
but I'm telling you,

26:07.566 --> 26:08.915
these people either
already have her,

26:08.958 --> 26:10.656
or they're minutes away from it.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.527
So, if you ever want
to see her again

26:12.571 --> 26:15.530
and give her that engagement
ring that you bought her,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.010

It is with sincerest regrets
that I make my apology

26:41.034 --> 26:44.428
to the American people,
as well as to my own countrymen.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.431
The kidnapping this morning
was a hoax.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.826
As you can see,
I am safe and well.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.568
I made up false claims
and staged my own kidnapping

26:53.612 --> 26:57.006
in order to make it look
like I was in danger,

26:57.050 --> 27:00.401
that my homeland
was responsible for the crimes,

27:00.444 --> 27:03.578
when in fact,
it was myself who was guilty.This is coerced.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.625

against my country,

27:06.668 --> 27:08.627

I will accept my punishment.

against my country,

I am now returning home where
I will accept my punishment.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.302
No.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.610
There's no way she recorded this
of her own free will.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.003
We're trying
to track down nationals

27:37.046 --> 27:39.527
from Amina's home country
who are in the L.A. area

27:39.570 --> 27:41.660
and loyal to the government,
but it's a slow process.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.270
What else can we do?

27:43.313 --> 27:44.532
Hold up.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.708
Those are prayer
beads, right?
Yeah.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.971
The aunt had some identical
to them when she came in.

27:49.015 --> 27:51.757
Amina's aunt? She was here?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.062
Yes, and her uncle. Why?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.325
Amina doesn't talk
to her uncle or aunt anymore.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.718
They had a falling out.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.459
About what?She thought,

27:58.502 --> 28:00.026
because they lived
in America for so long,

28:00.069 --> 28:01.549

about her culture

Amina speaking out about the
government and criticizing them

28:20.046 --> 28:22.091

great shame.

are all sold?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.941
Yeah, Lynch bought
the last one.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.814
Hey, is that the revuelta
with beans and cheese?Yeah.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.381
What did she put
in the sauce?

38:16.424 --> 38:17.817
Ah, it's a
trade secret.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.122
And that's gonna be $4.50.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.820
I thought you said
they were for free.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.125
No, that was earlier.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.388
Okay, we're running a
business, not a charity.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.606
Pay up.

38:24.650 --> 38:28.044
Go back there and
pay her. Go on.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.133
[both chuckling]

38:38.185 --> 38:40.230
How's he doing?Okay.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.407
Was talking about
making a run for it

38:42.450 --> 38:45.148
while you were gone,
but I convinced him to stay put.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.933
Best have bought me
something to eat.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.282
The food in here

38:48.326 --> 38:50.110
is godawful.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.112
Dad, you know, you can't
eat anything before surgery.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.288
That's another reason
I want out of here.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.943
And when did so many nurses
start being men?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.901
Least they
could do for

38:58.945 --> 39:01.382
an old dying fool
is give him some eye candy.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.470
[Brianna and Daniel chuckle]

39:02.514 --> 39:04.907
Some things never change.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.784
Thank you for coming back.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.311
You know...

39:18.399 --> 39:21.315
I'm a little scared
about all this.

39:25.798 --> 39:30.019
We know. That's why we're
all here for you, Pop.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.686
[overlapping chatter]

39:44.730 --> 39:45.687
Bye.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.864
Bye. Hey, thanks again, man.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.649
[sighs]

39:50.692 --> 39:52.259
The whole point
of an escape room

39:52.302 --> 39:54.392
is to figure out the clues,
not pick the lock.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.481
Hey, I got us out
of there, didn't I?

39:56.524 --> 39:58.570
With three seconds
left on the clock.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.094
We would've been
stuck there forever.

40:01.137 --> 40:04.619
No food, no water.
You know.

40:04.663 --> 40:05.838
Things would
turn ugly fast.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.317
Every man for himself.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.145
Well, someone really
likes to win, huh?

40:09.189 --> 40:11.234
Uh, is that not
the point of playing?

40:11.278 --> 40:13.628
Question, though:

40:13.672 --> 40:15.804
do you always carry
a lock pick wherever you go?

40:15.848 --> 40:18.894
I like to be prepared.Mm-hmm.

40:18.938 --> 40:21.506
Well, uh, this is me.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.422
Oh, wow.
It's a nice place.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.336
Yeah,
got a roof terrace.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.600
You can see the ocean.

40:28.643 --> 40:31.298
A glimpse at least.

40:31.341 --> 40:34.127
You want
to come up and see?

40:34.170 --> 40:37.652
Uh... I don't know.

40:37.696 --> 40:40.089
Ooh.No-no-no,

40:40.133 --> 40:42.352
it's-- hey.
It's not what you think.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.617
Molly, I like you.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.270
But?

40:47.314 --> 40:50.709
No buts. I just--
I like you.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.058
A lot.

40:52.101 --> 40:53.538
Okay, so?
[chuckles]

40:53.581 --> 40:58.281
In the past I've always--
I've treated things

40:58.325 --> 41:01.720
like a hundred-yard dash
as opposed to a marathon.

41:01.763 --> 41:05.375
You know? And things
have always...

41:05.419 --> 41:07.203
they've burned out
pretty quick.

41:07.247 --> 41:11.077
And I guess what I'm
saying kind of badly

41:11.120 --> 41:15.864
is, uh... I'd like to
take our time with this.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.261
How much time?

41:30.139 --> 41:32.272
A little longer
than that, maybe.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.625
That wasn't
really fair.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.864
Good night.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.083
[chuckles]

42:05.871 --> 42:07.133
[quietly]:
Yeah.
