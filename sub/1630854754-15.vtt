[RuPaul's "Who is She"]

00:04.804 --> 00:05.972
[singing] Who is she?

00:06.072 --> 00:08.541
We are one week away
from crowning

00:08.641 --> 00:10.810
America's Next Drag Superstar.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.880
But tonight,
we celebrate the biggest cast

00:13.980 --> 00:15.982
of the biggest season ever,

00:16.082 --> 00:18.518
and they are ready
to let loose.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.086
That was a lovely fairy tale.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.254
Let me give y'all the truth.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.489
[laughter]

00:22.589 --> 00:24.057
Legendary lip syncs...

00:24.157 --> 00:25.125
[laughter]

00:25.225 --> 00:26.259
Luminous looks...

00:26.359 --> 00:29.129
It's... not good.

00:29.229 --> 00:32.265
And all the drag queen
drama, mama.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.767
- It really hurt.
- The chapter's closed.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.968
Ooh!

00:35.068 --> 00:36.703
Did you make that up?

00:36.803 --> 00:38.438
[dramatic musical flourish]

00:38.538 --> 00:39.606
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

00:39.706 --> 00:41.041
The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

00:41.141 --> 00:42.409
receives a one-year supply

00:42.509 --> 00:44.677
of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics

00:44.778 --> 00:48.615
and a gag-worthy grand prize
of $200,000

00:48.715 --> 00:50.450
served by Cash App.

May the best drag queen

Best drag queen win

00:55.088 --> 00:56.423
[tires squealing]

00:57.457 --> 00:59.359
From the theater
at the Ace Hotel

00:59.459 --> 01:01.461
in downtown Los Angeles,

01:01.561 --> 01:03.296
bring back my girls.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.331
[singing] Bring back
my girls

01:06.366 --> 01:07.534
I don't stir the pot.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.035
[scoffs]
I smoke it.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.641
Ain't no rest
for this bitch face.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.112
Is the aura in here sickening,

01:19.212 --> 01:20.980
or is it just me?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.084
I may have gone home first,

01:24.184 --> 01:26.853
but I'm also a bitch.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.790
Most girls follow
the script.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.425
I flip it.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.564
I may have been cut
before the finale,

01:37.664 --> 01:40.233
but Loose-ing
is the new winning.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.337
I didn't ask to be
the beauty standard.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.706
I was just born this way.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.744
I may be a babydoll,

01:51.845 --> 01:54.414
but I'm not to be played with.

01:56.816 --> 01:58.318
If you come for me,

01:58.418 --> 02:00.753
I will apologize immediately.

02:03.356 --> 02:04.991
I may be a mistress,

02:05.091 --> 02:06.960
but, honey,
I'm Ru's main bitch.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.394
[titters]

02:10.597 --> 02:12.198
I'm quitting drag.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.333
You're welcome.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.371
Bad bitchery is
as bad bitchery does.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.843
You may see a little
Latin boy in drag crying,

02:23.943 --> 02:27.313
but I see a nice pair
of EsTitties.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.548
[snickers]

02:29.983 --> 02:32.719
I'm still
your favorite drag queen's

02:32.819 --> 02:33.920
favorite drag queen.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.659
both: We're not as annoying
as we look.

02:39.759 --> 02:40.793
Or are we?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.829
Ugh, I'm bored.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.132
[upbeat music]

02:46.232 --> 02:48.801
Welcome to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

02:48.902 --> 02:50.937
Now, in one week, Anetra,

02:51.037 --> 02:52.605
Luxx Noir London,

02:52.705 --> 02:54.207
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

02:54.307 --> 02:58.344
and Sasha Colby will tear up
this very stage

02:58.444 --> 02:59.979
as they battle for the title

03:00.079 --> 03:02.448
of America's
Next Drag Superstar.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.652
But tonight,
it's all about the sisterhood,

03:05.752 --> 03:09.856
because right now,
there is so much more at stake,

03:09.956 --> 03:13.459
and once again, drag queens
are on the frontlines

03:13.560 --> 03:15.094
fighting for freedom.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.829
And you can help.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.199
Scan this QR code and support

03:19.299 --> 03:22.969
the ACLU Drag Defense Fund now.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.137
Can I get an amen?

03:24.237 --> 03:25.638
all: Amen.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.040
When they go low,

03:27.140 --> 03:29.509
we go, "Hiii!"

03:29.609 --> 03:32.879
So shoulders back, tits out,

03:32.979 --> 03:36.583
and let's celebrate the light,
love, and laughter

03:36.683 --> 03:38.918
that is season 15.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.453
Can I get a neck crack?

03:40.553 --> 03:41.621
[whip cracks]

03:41.721 --> 03:42.789
[laughter]

03:42.889 --> 03:44.757
Let's go.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.392
Back for our 15th lap...

03:46.492 --> 03:47.894
Yes, mama!

03:47.994 --> 03:49.996
The stunts and the shenanigans

03:50.096 --> 03:52.699
are just getting started.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.934
[lip-synching] You better
walk that fucking duck

03:55.034 --> 03:56.636
[cheers and laughter]

03:56.736 --> 03:59.138
[all screaming]

03:59.239 --> 04:00.106
Uh, howdy, y'all.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.074
[whip cracks]

04:01.174 --> 04:03.943
[laughter]

04:04.043 --> 04:05.578
[as Joan Rivers] The only
thing that's worse than flying

04:05.678 --> 04:06.713
is sex with my ex-husband.

04:09.148 --> 04:12.852
[lip-synching] These are
our golden years

04:14.520 --> 04:17.223
I was like,
oh, my God, that's a star.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.592
Can I get a halleloo?

04:19.692 --> 04:20.660
all: Halleloo!

04:20.760 --> 04:21.861
If you're gonna swing big,

04:21.961 --> 04:23.196
this would be the place
to do it.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.632
[gasps] Vertebrae, you stay.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.967
It looks like something that
would be from the Met Gala.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.637
Can we some water,
'cause that zebra is panting.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.305
It's giving me
House of MonÃ¡e.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.507
When you turned the corner,
I gasped.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.576
Baby, she tore that shit up.

04:36.676 --> 04:37.610
Can we just talk
about this look?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.312
If you had asked me if I'd be

04:39.412 --> 04:41.614
hosting a television show
back then,

04:41.714 --> 04:43.583
you know what my answer
would have been?

04:43.683 --> 04:45.318
- Yes?
- Yes!

04:45.418 --> 04:48.421
This is our 200th episode.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.989
You don't look
a day over 100.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.190
[laughter]

04:51.291 --> 04:52.392
Now who's gonna
read the will?

04:52.492 --> 04:54.694
both: Eww!

04:54.794 --> 04:56.763
If you stay machete,

04:56.863 --> 04:59.065
you ain't gotta get machete!

04:59.165 --> 05:02.468
Can we please talk
about that fucking lip sync?

05:02.568 --> 05:05.505
[dramatic electronic music]

05:05.605 --> 05:07.373
[cheers]

05:07.473 --> 05:10.376
America's Next
Drag Superstar needs

05:10.476 --> 05:12.879
to have all the right moves.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.081
For the first time
this season,

05:15.181 --> 05:17.050
shantay, you both stay.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.485
[laughing]

05:19.585 --> 05:22.622
I think drag is the most
joyous art form that there is.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.124
That is the greatest thing
in the world to hear,

05:25.224 --> 05:27.493
especially at a time
like this where there's

05:27.593 --> 05:31.431
so many people trying to take
down queer representation.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.366
We still shouldn't
be having, like,

05:33.466 --> 05:36.602
problems about drag queens
reading a story to kids.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.371
The whole thing is,
we don't want our kids

05:38.471 --> 05:41.207
exposed to this because
drag queens are gonna be

05:41.307 --> 05:42.975
like a bad influence on them.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.545
My queer family took me
to my first drag show,

05:45.645 --> 05:47.513
and it saved my life.

05:47.613 --> 05:51.017
And it's made this life
such a joy to live.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.853
[lip-synching] Drag is a fight

05:53.953 --> 05:55.822
Drag is a protest

05:55.922 --> 06:00.193
Drag only reveals
who you really are

06:00.293 --> 06:01.994
I think that queer people
just saying,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.564
we can't be fucked with the
way that y'all think we can,

06:04.664 --> 06:07.300
that's going to be
the driving force for change.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.804
It's no accident
you're standing on this stage.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.039
- Top four.
- Top four!

06:13.139 --> 06:14.941
[all cheering]

06:15.041 --> 06:16.376
I know how hard this is.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.113
You should be very,
very proud of yourselves.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.218
- [cheers and laughter]
- Yas!

06:25.318 --> 06:27.720
Now, each season
I'm curious to find out

06:27.820 --> 06:30.623
what my girls take away
from their time at "Drag Race."

06:30.723 --> 06:34.327
But this season, one queen
took more than others.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.596
[laughs]

06:36.696 --> 06:40.533
Mistress, is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

06:40.633 --> 06:44.337
Um, you know, I took away
so many lovely lessons,

06:44.437 --> 06:45.772
of course, Ru.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.308
Because apparently
all the queens voted you

06:49.409 --> 06:52.211
the girl most likely
to steal your stuff.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.447
Might've taken a book or two,
some earrings...

06:54.547 --> 06:56.282
[laughter]

06:56.382 --> 06:58.751
Did anybody
see her taking anything?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.721
Put that motherfucking
hand down.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.156
[laughter]

07:03.256 --> 07:05.091
She left me a note
asking for one of my wigs,

07:05.191 --> 07:06.325
and she told me
she wouldn't fuck with me

07:06.426 --> 07:07.560
if I didn't give it to her.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.095
And here we are.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.663
Nice to see you, Eileen.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.099
[laughter]

07:13.199 --> 07:15.568
Did you decide to take things
when you got there,

07:15.668 --> 07:18.538
or did you have a plan
before you got there

07:18.638 --> 07:19.672
that you would take things?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.240
What's less time in prison?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.509
Premeditated or...
[laughter]

07:23.609 --> 07:25.111
But I'm not the only one.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.280
Miss Walk That Duck,
tell her what you took too.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.548
- [laughter]
- I don't know.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.183
Look, season 16
the lights will be

07:30.283 --> 07:31.551
a little dim,
let's just say that.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.786
- Okay.
- Anetra took a light bulb.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.188
- Don't be shy, bitch.
- It was--

07:35.288 --> 07:36.622
listen, "Drag Race" was lit,

07:36.722 --> 07:37.990
and I wanted a piece of it.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.792
- Okay.
- Now.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.128
Well, Mistress,
I have to inform you,

07:42.228 --> 07:43.396
you will be getting a bill.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.198
[laughter]

07:45.298 --> 07:48.601
Now, this season for the first
time in "Drag Race" herstory,

07:48.701 --> 07:50.403
we had twins.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.671
Take a look.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.041
Well, this doesn't look
like the toy store.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.642
Sweetie, that was my line.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.377
Ugh, whatever.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.012
- I'm Sugar.
- And I'm Spice.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.582
And we're the dolls...
both: That came to life.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.351
So you certainly are
Sugar's sister.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.253
We should really just
be called Canned and Bit.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.188
Yeah, we have so many bits,
and they're so canned.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.057
We have all the good bits.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.725
Sugar and Spice
are a fucking hoot.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.560
[upbeat electronic music]

08:14.660 --> 08:16.596
[laughter]

08:18.698 --> 08:19.632
Eh.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.167
God, I'm annoying.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.102
[laughter]

08:23.202 --> 08:26.906
[singing] Jesus, you are
my best friend

08:27.006 --> 08:28.875
[laughing goofily]

08:28.975 --> 08:30.710
I'm just gonna do this
for my own sanity.

08:30.810 --> 08:31.844
- Let me go to the end.
- I'm gonna move you

08:31.944 --> 08:33.079
- down to the end.
- Let me go to the end.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.380
After I got shut down,
I was like,

08:34.480 --> 08:35.848
okay, let me just
take a back seat.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.384
You're still on probation
to being "my daughter."

08:38.484 --> 08:40.253
Okay.
I have to get it together.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.888
Let me teach you
lesson number one.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.422
You do not let
a bitch step over you.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.358
You clock 'em the first time
so they won't ever do it again.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.693
I'm done with apologizing
for being too much.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.362
Like, whatever.
Let me own it.

08:51.764 --> 08:52.698
This is a twin sync...

08:52.798 --> 08:54.233
[clicks tongue]
For your life.

08:54.333 --> 08:58.004
[cheers and laughter]

08:58.104 --> 09:00.139
all: Aww.

09:00.239 --> 09:03.643
Now, Sugar and Spice,
you came in as outsiders,

09:03.743 --> 09:05.745
but you adapted pretty quickly.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.346
What have you learned?

09:07.446 --> 09:08.681
Wow.
I hate to be,

09:08.781 --> 09:11.017
like, Miss America,
but honestly,

09:11.117 --> 09:13.886
I've learned that I'm
way stronger than I think.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.856
Going through this experience,
you have to be mentally there.

09:16.956 --> 09:20.026
If you are not--
it will show, you know?

09:20.126 --> 09:21.561
And it will break you.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.095
And also I learned

09:23.195 --> 09:25.598
that we're way more similar
than we realize.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.768
Like, coming in, I definitely
really wanted to make friends

09:28.868 --> 09:30.102
and have that sense
of community

09:30.202 --> 09:32.071
because for us,
we were stuck in the suburbs,

09:32.171 --> 09:33.706
like, hiding in our house
doing drag.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.174
We were like caged animals,

09:35.274 --> 09:36.542
never used to talking
to people in drag before.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.644
Do you still feel that way,
like caged animals?

09:38.744 --> 09:40.379
Sometimes I feel like
a Chihuahua

09:40.479 --> 09:41.981
or a rottweiler, one of those.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.082
Sugar's going
on her tangents.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.017
But basically, I feel like

09:45.117 --> 09:46.385
I learned a lot...
[stifled laughter]

09:46.485 --> 09:48.187
But mostly that--like she said,

09:48.287 --> 09:49.355
that I'm strong enough.

09:49.455 --> 09:50.489
But what's interesting,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.658
I will say, is that--

09:52.758 --> 09:53.993
wait, I lost my thought.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.761
[laughter and chatter]

09:55.861 --> 09:57.096
- Listen, it's all right.
- The last two brain cells.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.230
You're my other brain cell.
You find it.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.299
Okay.
Who was the first born?

10:00.399 --> 10:01.400
Me.
So I actually--

10:01.500 --> 10:03.436
I'm born 57 minutes older.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.538
And normally, twins are, like,
one minute apart, but, um--

10:05.638 --> 10:06.872
But I always say,
I kicked you out of the womb.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.140
- Yeah, kind of.
- And you know, I was chillin'.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.141
Well, I kicked you out
of the competition so--

10:09.241 --> 10:10.610
Oh.
all: Ooh!

10:10.710 --> 10:13.446
[laughter]

10:13.546 --> 10:16.282
What were you doing
in the womb for 57 minutes?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.450
Oh, I was
getting comfortable.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.852
Imagine--okay,
imagine being cooped up

10:19.952 --> 10:21.887
in your mother's womb for,
like, nine months.

10:21.988 --> 10:22.955
Sweetie, I kicked her out,
and I go,

10:23.055 --> 10:24.223
ooh, I got some breathing room.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.292
[laughter]

10:26.392 --> 10:29.862
Now, Mistress, you had doubts
about the twins at first why?

10:29.962 --> 10:32.264
The Houston, Texas,
drag scene's very traditional.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.335
And we really don't have
queens like Sugar and Spice.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.004
So in that aspect,
when I first saw them,

10:38.104 --> 10:39.872
I was kind of like, bitch,
stop playing in my profession.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.507
I think that's a book title.

10:41.607 --> 10:42.742
[laughter]

10:42.842 --> 10:44.343
Drag is very serious to me.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.579
And I'm the fucking
gatekeeper of drag.

10:46.679 --> 10:47.913
- Like, I don't care.
- The mayor of Dragville.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.148
Someone's gotta
keep the gates.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.283
A lot of us came up
in the club scene,

10:51.384 --> 10:53.285
and for me,
when I saw the twins,

10:53.386 --> 10:54.487
I felt the same way
as Mistress.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.022
I was like, stop playing
in my profession.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.790
And I had to humble myself

10:57.890 --> 11:00.292
and realize that there's not
one right way

11:00.393 --> 11:01.527
to be a full-time drag queen.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.362
I love that.
Now, this season was

11:03.462 --> 11:05.598
the era of the eras.

11:05.698 --> 11:06.999
Take a look.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.735
Well, girls, I'm officially
entering my top era.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.138
In the words of Mistress,
I'm in my winning era.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.739
I'm just so happy for you,
'cause I feel like

11:13.839 --> 11:15.708
you're finally entering
your bitch era.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.810
[laughter]

11:17.910 --> 11:20.046
I'm starting
my Congeniality era right now.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.714
[laughter]

11:21.814 --> 11:24.784
Bitch, Mistress has more eras
than Cher or Madonna, girl.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.153
I am entering my angel era.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.055
Fallen angel.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.057
What Mistress era
are we in right now?

11:31.157 --> 11:32.958
We are in the top three era.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.193
[laughter]

11:34.293 --> 11:35.828
It's the end
to my Congenial era.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.830
I'm entering my chaotic era.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.299
Oh, no.
It wasn't chaotic before?

11:40.399 --> 11:41.867
Shut up!

11:41.967 --> 11:43.936
What I would like to see
is her skinny era, bitch.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.337
Let's see that.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.605
[laughs]

11:46.706 --> 11:48.908
[laughter]

11:49.008 --> 11:50.309
So, Mistress,

11:50.409 --> 11:52.945
what makes an era an era?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.947
You know, a era--
you know, some of the girls

11:55.047 --> 11:56.782
I think heard "error"...

11:56.882 --> 11:59.318
[laughter]

11:59.418 --> 12:01.320
When you're in your era,
it's however you're feeling,

12:01.420 --> 12:03.489
like, right now
I'm in my angelic era,

12:03.589 --> 12:05.658
I'm feeling very congenial era.

12:05.758 --> 12:07.793
So, like, you can have multiple
going on at the same time.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.061
And they can have
multiple meanings.

12:09.161 --> 12:10.262
Like, when I said
I'm in my top era,

12:10.362 --> 12:11.764
I meant on top
of the toy shelves,

12:11.864 --> 12:12.998
collector edition.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.300
She's in her vers era now.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.468
Yes.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.469
Yes, of course.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.970
Now, queens, is there anyone

12:18.070 --> 12:19.905
who wants to announce
a new era?

12:20.005 --> 12:22.241
I'm in my screen time era.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.876
[laughter]

12:23.976 --> 12:25.211
That part.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.446
It's been a really long time.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.281
Any other eras
before we move on?

12:29.381 --> 12:30.883
Well, I'm
in my nailification era.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.685
I don't even consider myself
on the show,

12:32.785 --> 12:33.919
'cause I wasn't
wearing nails then.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.354
both:
You're not wearing nails now.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.156
Uh--
[laughter]

12:37.256 --> 12:40.025
- She's in her glove era.
- Oh, my God.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.027
Well, queens, I wanna announce

12:42.128 --> 12:44.296
my go-to-bed-at-8:00-p.m. era.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.498
[laughter]

12:45.598 --> 12:48.400
Now we're gonna be
right back after this.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.703
singing]

12:50.803 --> 12:52.171
I bring the beat

12:52.271 --> 12:55.074
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

12:55.174 --> 12:58.277
Losing is the new winning,
but this season,

12:58.377 --> 13:00.913
everybody wanted
to be number two.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.348
Let's take a look.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.451
I feel pretty good
to have been in the top two.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.685
I would like to say
it's the top two.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.587
- [laughs]
- Let's go with that.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.322
Okay.
[laughter]

13:10.422 --> 13:12.124
The CDC should really look
into making

13:12.224 --> 13:13.993
a drag delusion vaccine,

13:14.093 --> 13:15.661
because at this point
in the competition,

13:15.761 --> 13:18.063
the drag delusion might
be contagious.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.064
Okay, so what's the rank?

13:19.165 --> 13:20.266
Third.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.333
Second.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.334
First.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.836
I think first, second.

13:23.936 --> 13:24.837
[laughter]

13:24.937 --> 13:26.338
First, second, third.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.073
First, second.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.608
Okay.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.143
You said that you thought
you were gonna be second.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.745
- Mm-hmm.
- And you were second.

13:32.845 --> 13:33.946
[laughter]

13:34.046 --> 13:35.481
Marcia thought
she was in second place.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.616
As someone who was there
in reality,

13:37.716 --> 13:39.318
um, she wasn't amazing.

13:39.418 --> 13:42.655
I was behind you
in the ranking.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.191
Marcia, being realistic,
I don't think you would be

13:45.291 --> 13:46.992
behind her because your look is
kind of cheap,

13:47.092 --> 13:48.194
and I don't think
during Snatch Game

13:48.294 --> 13:49.728
- that you were that funny.
- Ohh.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.330
I mean, I really felt
y'all were, like,

13:51.430 --> 13:53.799
gonna be ahead of me.
Um, how do you all feel?

13:53.899 --> 13:55.534
- I'm surprised.
- Yeah.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.303
I really expected to win.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.638
Are we that shocked?

13:59.738 --> 14:01.340
Loosey thinks she should
win every week.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.876
I'm fucking pissed.
Very, very upset

14:03.976 --> 14:06.111
that I was not in the top.

14:06.212 --> 14:07.413
Okay.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.849
[laughter]

14:09.949 --> 14:11.717
All right,
let's talk about this, okay?

14:11.817 --> 14:16.188
Now, Rosie O'Donnell
versus Tim Gunn.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.057
Mistress, Marcia,
who's number two?

14:18.157 --> 14:19.725
I think you're thinking
about Rosie O'Donnell

14:19.825 --> 14:21.093
mixed with Abby Lee Miller.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.229
[laughter]

14:23.329 --> 14:25.164
Um, you know,
Marcia, I'll let you have it.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.532
- What do you think, babe?
- Yeah, I mean,

14:26.632 --> 14:28.901
in terms of, like,
the Snatch Game,

14:29.001 --> 14:32.705
my impression was better
than Rosie O'Miller.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.240
- Rosie O'Miller?
- Rosie O'Miller.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.507
Um...

14:35.608 --> 14:36.909
Queens,
what do you think of that?

14:37.009 --> 14:38.410
Well, it's not hard for you
to impersonate a man.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.446
- all: Ooh.
- Okay, all right.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.915
I feel like, even though
people think it's funny

14:43.015 --> 14:44.850
we're fighting for second place
or here and there,

14:44.950 --> 14:46.285
we still want
our cahoots, bitch.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.520
You know, the fans be
making points systems.

14:48.621 --> 14:49.922
- Exactly.
- So it does matter at the end

14:50.022 --> 14:51.223
of the day because that's
how they rank it.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.725
- But does it?
- But also, in the argument

14:52.825 --> 14:54.526
with Marcia, I don't care
about being number two.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.262
Actually, I never brought it up
in "Untucked."

14:56.362 --> 14:57.796
Marcia brought it up
that she thought she ranked

14:57.897 --> 15:00.366
higher than me, which is why
I had to gather the girls

15:00.466 --> 15:02.301
and clock the tea.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.104
All right, next,
in All Queens Go to Heaven,

15:05.204 --> 15:07.706
Luxx versus Loosey.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.541
Who's number two?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.677
I would say
that I'm number two.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.213
[laughing] - Um,
and I base that

15:14.313 --> 15:16.949
strictly off
of how it was called.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.350
They called,
Loosey, you're safe.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.486
Luxx, you're safe.
Sasha, you won.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.455
So in my head,
that's third, second, first.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.357
But also, I just--

15:25.457 --> 15:27.226
I'm always gonna think
that I did amazing.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.928
And I thought--
and I thought that I did

15:29.028 --> 15:30.362
a really good job
in the challenge.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.698
I got rave reviews
for my runway.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.466
And--I mean, as you did too.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.468
But in my head, like--
[laughter]

15:36.568 --> 15:38.938
In my head, of course
you're gonna put yourself--

15:39.038 --> 15:40.205
- like, you know.
- Yeah.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.907
All right,
let's talk about the "50/50"

15:42.007 --> 15:43.709
newsmagazine challenge.

15:43.809 --> 15:47.346
Luxx versus Loosey again.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.315
Who's number two?

15:49.415 --> 15:51.317
I think I might have
been number two.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.319
[laughter]

15:53.419 --> 15:55.187
Let's talk about both
of those challenges

15:55.287 --> 15:56.455
and who was number one though.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.325
[all exclaiming]

15:59.425 --> 16:01.026
Luxx and Loosey,
why do you think

16:01.126 --> 16:03.729
there was such tension
between the two of you?

16:03.829 --> 16:05.464
- both: I don't know...
- If I would call it--

16:05.564 --> 16:06.665
[laughter]

16:06.765 --> 16:08.367
I'll say it:
sexual magnetism.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.368
Oh, okay.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.703
I think we just both really,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.371
really, really wanted
to win everything.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.073
- Yeah.
- And so when you get close,

16:14.173 --> 16:15.941
it sucks--believe me.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.142
- Yeah.
- It sucks.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.112
Your Joan Rivers
in the Snatch Game was

16:20.212 --> 16:22.014
- perfection.
- Thank you.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.017
But after being safe
in Daytona Wind,

16:25.117 --> 16:26.719
you were, and I quote,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.253
both: "Fucking pissed."

16:28.354 --> 16:29.722
[laughter]

16:29.822 --> 16:32.191
Why?
Why were you fucking pissed?

16:32.291 --> 16:34.426
I--I took a couple more sips

16:34.526 --> 16:35.561
of those
House of Love cocktails

16:35.661 --> 16:36.762
than maybe I should have.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.764
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh, you know--

16:38.864 --> 16:40.199
- [laughs]
- They'll get you, girl.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.502
I was in my feels,
and I felt like I, um--

16:43.602 --> 16:45.170
I don't know,
I just wanted to win.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.705
Yeah.
No, you were great in that.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.941
Now, Mistress of course had
something to say about that.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.743
You had a term for what
she was going through.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.378
What was that?

16:52.478 --> 16:55.547
You know, a little bit of
drag delusion here and there.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.316
Did anybody else suffer
from drag delusion?

16:57.416 --> 16:59.685
You know, it was going around
to all the contestants.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.487
All the girls were a little
delusional at some point.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.490
But then someone said
I might have been patient zero.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.625
So I don't know.
[laughter]

17:06.725 --> 17:08.961
And I think that person was
absolutely right.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.429
[laughter]

17:10.529 --> 17:11.964
- Now, Amethyst and Robin...
- Oh, boy.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.499
You know Loosey
from back home.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.700
[laughter]

17:14.800 --> 17:17.202
Did her reaction
surprise you at all?

17:17.302 --> 17:19.438
I distinctly remember--
I think it was

17:19.538 --> 17:21.340
right when I started drag,
in the dressing room--

17:21.440 --> 17:22.875
it was one of our first
shows together--

17:22.975 --> 17:24.676
and "Drag Race" was brought up.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.745
And I--and I quote,

17:26.845 --> 17:28.714
"If I don't win every fucking
challenge on that show"--

17:28.814 --> 17:30.015
She has drag delusion
right now.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.250
I don't know
what she's talking about.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.886
You lie, you lie,
and you lie so much.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.155
Now, Loosey, a lot
of people really appreciated

17:36.255 --> 17:37.890
your spirit and your talent.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.026
And here's a message
from one of them.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.428
Okay.

17:42.528 --> 17:47.433
Hey, this is Kev
with a message for Loosey.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.371
Hey, your performance
in "Wigloose" was off the hook.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.907
Condragulations,
and lots of love.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.875
You really know
how to cut loose.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.010
Cut, cut loose!

17:58.110 --> 18:00.646
- [overlapping chatter]
- Oh, my God.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.581
That is absolutely bonkers.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.217
Yes.
One degree of Kevin Bacon.

18:05.317 --> 18:06.251
And were you surprised by that?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.020
Um, yeah, absolutely.

18:08.120 --> 18:12.291
I mean, he--he tweeted at me
a couples weeks ago,

18:12.391 --> 18:14.893
which felt amazing,
specifically because,

18:14.993 --> 18:17.863
of course,
he's famous for "Footloose."

18:17.963 --> 18:19.932
But yeah, that was so cool.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.033
- Oh, my God.
- That's great.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.201
Now, Loosey, in other news,

18:22.301 --> 18:24.036
your original song,
"Let Loose,"

18:24.136 --> 18:25.704
has gone viral.

18:25.804 --> 18:26.939
- Yes.
- Let's take a look.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.308
[lip-synching] So
you better beware

18:29.408 --> 18:32.478
Let loose,
I said let loose

18:32.578 --> 18:35.681
You're holdin' it together,
baby, what's the use?

18:35.781 --> 18:36.982
Let loose

18:37.082 --> 18:38.150
[laughter]

18:38.250 --> 18:39.751
- I love it.
- But can we talk

18:39.852 --> 18:41.520
about the international implications

18:41.620 --> 18:43.355
of why that song went vi--
like, it's so--

18:43.455 --> 18:45.257
like, it was ironic
that you were Loo--

18:45.357 --> 18:46.658
and then you weren't loose,
and then you were loose,

18:46.758 --> 18:47.993
and that's how it became viral.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.661
Like, you were so not loose,
you were loose.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.263
- Like, it's iconic.
- Irene's line of,

18:51.363 --> 18:53.065
"She's singing
about letting loose,

18:53.165 --> 18:54.600
- but she's standing there..."
- Standing as rigid

18:54.700 --> 18:56.201
- as a dead fish.
- "Like a rigid fish."

18:56.301 --> 18:58.370
[laughter]

18:58.470 --> 19:01.473
So, Loosey, do you think
you can let loose now?

19:01.573 --> 19:02.741
Oh, I can definitely
let loose--

19:02.841 --> 19:03.909
if I listen to the song
every day.

19:04.009 --> 19:04.943
Okay, come on, every--

19:05.043 --> 19:06.211
all the queens, let's say it.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.280
all: Let loose!

19:08.380 --> 19:10.149
We'll be right back
after this.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.885
[singing] Let loose,
I said let loose

19:12.985 --> 19:16.288
You're holdin' it together,
baby, what's the use?

19:16.388 --> 19:17.589
Let loose

19:17.689 --> 19:19.725
[upbeat music]

19:19.825 --> 19:22.461
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited"

19:22.561 --> 19:24.997
with the queens of season 15.

19:25.097 --> 19:29.134
Now, every week we look forward
to a lip sync for your life.

19:29.234 --> 19:34.239
But this season,
we had lip syncs to die for.

19:35.407 --> 19:38.076
Our first lip sync was
Sasha versus Anetra

19:38.177 --> 19:39.344
in the LaLaPaRuza.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.713
Now, Sasha,
what was your state of mind

19:41.813 --> 19:43.849
going into that lip sync?

19:43.949 --> 19:46.451
I was ready
to dance with this one,

19:46.552 --> 19:49.221
'cause I know
she's a powerhouse.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.657
Right, no,
so you're both very young.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.092
How long do you think
you can be able to do

19:54.193 --> 19:56.061
all of that kind of acrobatics?

19:56.161 --> 19:57.462
Like, ten more minutes.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.498
[laughter]

19:59.598 --> 20:00.766
And then it's over.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.668
And so what do
you other queens think

20:02.768 --> 20:04.403
of that lip sync in particular?

20:04.503 --> 20:05.837
- Oh, it was--
- Oh, it was everything.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.439
It was hands down one
of the most amazing lip syncs.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.208
I'll never count to eight
the same way again.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.410
[laughter]

20:11.510 --> 20:12.611
I think we're all happy
we didn't have

20:12.711 --> 20:13.812
to lip-synch against either
of them.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.614
all: Yeah.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.350
Up next, the lip sync
Michelle Visage called

20:18.450 --> 20:20.886
her favorite of all time.

20:20.986 --> 20:23.855
That's Anetra versus Marcia.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.958
Marcia, what happened
out there?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.226
I said, you know what,

20:27.326 --> 20:28.794
we're gonna strap on
the performer boots,

20:28.894 --> 20:30.862
and we're gonna just
give it everything we've got.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.598
And if we're gonna go out,

20:32.698 --> 20:35.133
we're gonna go out kicking
and backbending, I guess.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.468
Well, you certainly did.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.970
You were fantastic.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.872
In fact, you know,
the Internet lit up

20:40.973 --> 20:43.609
because they felt it should
have been a double save.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.877
I mean, there's definitely
validation in it.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.648
But I mean, I think--
I'm a very strong performer.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.584
I know that about myself.
But I was, at the time--

20:52.684 --> 20:55.487
and I still am a little bit--
a little green for drag.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.723
So I tried my darndest.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.758
Yeah.
Now, did either of you watch

20:59.858 --> 21:01.793
that lip sync
in a public place,

21:01.893 --> 21:02.861
like at a viewing party?

21:02.961 --> 21:04.062
I was at
a viewing party, yes.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.163
- Uh-huh.
- And what was

21:05.264 --> 21:06.632
the reaction in the room?

21:06.732 --> 21:08.400
It was like watching
straight people watch,

21:08.500 --> 21:09.668
like, football.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.769
- Yes.
- Not the halftime show,

21:10.869 --> 21:11.770
'cause that's for us.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.372
[laughter]

21:13.472 --> 21:15.407
I don't it's a coincidence
that Anetra was in two

21:15.507 --> 21:16.642
of the best lip syncs
of the season.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.076
- You're a phenomenal performer.
- Thank you.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.279
Every time you would start
flubbing a challenge,

21:20.379 --> 21:21.413
I'd get excited.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.015
[laughter]

21:23.115 --> 21:25.083
We get to see
her perform tonight.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.585
Do a trick, pony.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.520
Yeah, now, in the LaLaPaRuza,

21:28.620 --> 21:31.356
you all had to make
several many choices.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.491
Now, Malaysia...

21:32.591 --> 21:33.592
- Oh, gosh.
- You were up first.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.060
Let's take a look.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.795
Malaysia,

21:36.895 --> 21:40.999
now you get to choose
your opponent.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.201
Girl, just say my name.
Come on.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.704
Give the girls what they want,
Malaysia versus Mistress.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.106
Who do you choose?

21:48.206 --> 21:50.709
[dramatic music]

21:50.809 --> 21:52.277
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.714
[laughter]

21:55.814 --> 21:57.516
Why'd you pick me?

21:57.616 --> 21:59.117
Um, it was no reason.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.086
Honestly, I just went blank,

22:01.186 --> 22:02.688
and I was like--
you was next to me.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.659
I call bullshit.
I feel like you really thought

22:07.759 --> 22:08.960
you were gonna slay Marcia.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.395
No.
I mean--

22:10.495 --> 22:13.432
[laughter]

22:15.334 --> 22:18.036
Now, Malaysia,
why did you pick Marcia?

22:18.136 --> 22:19.838
I don't know.
[laughs]

22:19.938 --> 22:20.906
Still you don't know?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.874
Honestly...

22:22.974 --> 22:24.009
- Go ahead.
- When you look back

22:24.109 --> 22:26.144
at the show, um,
Mistress had already put

22:26.244 --> 22:28.914
a target on Marcia,
Loosey, and Spice,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.149
and named them the three
weakest lip-synchers.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.417
But I always gave...

22:32.517 --> 22:33.585
- When did that happen?
- Marcia her praise,

22:33.685 --> 22:35.354
especially after seeing
her talent show.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.322
I had never seen Spice
or Loosey perform

22:37.422 --> 22:38.490
besides "Letting Loose."

22:38.590 --> 22:40.292
Um...
[laughter]

22:40.392 --> 22:42.661
Mistress had her eye
on another song.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.296
And she told me
that she would do

22:44.396 --> 22:47.432
the song that I wanted to do,
which was Celine,

22:47.532 --> 22:49.034
"It's All Coming Back
to Me Now."

22:49.134 --> 22:51.403
Yeah, I was like,
she gonna flip the script, so.

22:51.503 --> 22:52.938
And when I was looking,
I think Marcia was next to me,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.107
so that was the easy choice.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.508
That was a lovely fairy tale.

22:56.608 --> 22:57.809
Let me give y'all the truth.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.177
[laughter]

22:59.277 --> 23:01.012
So my sister made
the right decision,

23:01.113 --> 23:02.781
because I'm a filthy
fucking liar.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.683
I would not have
chose Celine Dion.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.318
We would've been twirling
to "Tell It to My Heart."

23:06.418 --> 23:08.120
So I think Malaysia
kind of knew what's up,

23:08.220 --> 23:10.389
'cause she's not dumb,
so I'll give it to you, sister.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.491
But also, I got that leg
up in the air, bitch.

23:12.591 --> 23:14.025
- [overlapping chatter]
- Get that leg up.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.861
Now, Marcia, do you buy

23:15.961 --> 23:18.263
Malaysia's description
of how it happened?

23:18.363 --> 23:21.266
When you're up there,
you kind of just--

23:21.366 --> 23:22.567
you kind of black out,

23:22.667 --> 23:24.336
and you're like, I'll do this.

23:24.436 --> 23:28.140
Um, either way, I--
I wasn't worried about anyone,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.475
except for maybe, obviously,
the two on the end over there.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.576
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

23:31.676 --> 23:32.978
Now, Sasha, did you know

23:33.078 --> 23:35.514
everybody felt that way
about you?

23:35.614 --> 23:37.282
Um...

23:37.382 --> 23:38.283
uh, yeah.

23:38.383 --> 23:40.652
[laughter]

23:40.752 --> 23:41.987
I'm not in my congenial era.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.955
No, no, I get it.
I get it.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.125
All right, next, after
Mistress won her lip sync,

23:47.225 --> 23:50.095
she got a cold reception
in the Werkroom.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.963
[muted scream] -
Let's take a look.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.498
- Jax, right?
- Oh, my God,

23:53.598 --> 23:54.766
- Jax, no question.
- Jax for sure.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.101
Ugh, and I bet
Mistress is gonna

23:56.201 --> 23:57.903
feel some sort of way.
But here's the thing--

23:58.003 --> 23:59.237
Now, y'all knew
the heavyweight champ

23:59.337 --> 24:00.238
- was gonna win.
- Oh, my God!

24:00.338 --> 24:01.473
It was really nothing.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.275
[laughter]

24:03.375 --> 24:04.676
Ooh, why you gagging, honey?

24:06.144 --> 24:08.246
Bitch!

24:08.346 --> 24:09.815
Work.
We'll be honest,

24:09.915 --> 24:10.916
we thought Jax won
that lip sync.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.417
- both: Yeah.
- Oh, well, y'all need

24:12.517 --> 24:13.752
to get y'all's eyes
checked, honey.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.221
- Uh!
- So why'd you think Jax won?

24:16.321 --> 24:19.191
She was very, like,
vroom, vroom.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.461
- You weren't giving 100%.
- Yeah.

24:22.561 --> 24:23.929
Whether you thought
I did a great job or not,

24:24.029 --> 24:25.030
I'm still here,
so it doesn't...

24:25.130 --> 24:27.265
- Absolutely
- Really matter to me.

24:27.365 --> 24:29.835
Since the girls wanna start
reading as soon as I walk in,

24:29.935 --> 24:31.303
they changed my whole mood too,

24:31.403 --> 24:33.171
so I'm like,
let's get right into it.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.073
Like, Loosey, I mean, I feel
like you definitely lucked out,

24:35.173 --> 24:36.708
like, getting to pick Spice,
no tea.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.243
- Yeah, yeah.
- Also, I didn't

24:38.343 --> 24:40.145
take into account that
the girls who people didn't

24:40.245 --> 24:41.913
want to go against would
be there to the very end.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.184
"All of the girls that, like,
people didn't think were gonna

24:46.284 --> 24:49.254
be good lip-synchers were
picked first, so."

24:49.354 --> 24:51.156
And I was like,
well, you can go fuck yourself.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.257
Oh, my God,
don't put that in there.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.592
I didn't say that. Sorry.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.727
Oh, my God, it's gonna be used.
No!

24:56.895 --> 24:58.697
Mistress, what had happened?

24:58.797 --> 25:01.466
The lip sync between me
and Jax is very--

25:01.566 --> 25:02.968
it's two different types
of performances

25:03.068 --> 25:04.336
and two different types
of drag.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.738
My whole perspective
on drag is keeping

25:06.838 --> 25:08.406
old-school and traditional
drag alive,

25:08.507 --> 25:10.509
and that's how I perform
the song when it's given to me.

25:10.609 --> 25:12.344
So I think in this day and age,

25:12.444 --> 25:14.079
a lot of queens and a lot
of people at home are used

25:14.179 --> 25:16.248
to seeing people kick,
flip, and split,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.683
which of course I can do and
keep up with any of y'all...

25:18.783 --> 25:19.851
[laughing] - But I think

25:19.951 --> 25:21.286
that we're playing a game.

25:21.386 --> 25:23.121
Some people are just
worrying about surviving.

25:23.221 --> 25:24.322
I'm worried about winning.

25:24.422 --> 25:26.024
I know
Jax is a great performer,

25:26.124 --> 25:28.326
so either way,
one of us would've had to go

25:28.426 --> 25:30.462
against Sasha and Anetra
because that's what was left.

25:30.562 --> 25:33.265
So you obviously wanna
save something

25:33.365 --> 25:35.767
you could showcase later
and get that upper hand, so...

25:35.867 --> 25:37.035
- Okay.
- It's no tea.

25:37.135 --> 25:39.538
[giggles] I still
think Jax won.

25:39.638 --> 25:40.705
[laughter]

25:40.805 --> 25:42.641
Okay, but here's my question. Jax.

25:42.741 --> 25:43.708
- Yeah?
- You saw it.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.911
Do you think
you ate Mistress or naw?

25:46.011 --> 25:47.879
I--honestly, like,
I think it was pretty balanced.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.915
- Like, I'm not gonna, like--
- I agree.

25:50.015 --> 25:51.416
Maybe I'll take a note
out of, like, Luxx's book

25:51.516 --> 25:52.551
and be like,
no, I fucking won that.

25:52.651 --> 25:53.919
Um...

25:54.019 --> 25:55.587
Well, I just don't do it
out of nowhere.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.322
There's a rhyme and a reason.
[laughter]

25:57.422 --> 25:59.691
- Hold on, let's not get crazy.
- Hold on, whoa.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.326
Loosey, what do you have
to say?

26:01.426 --> 26:04.529
Uh, I agree with Salina.
I do think that Jax won.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.532
And the reason why I said,
at the time,

26:07.632 --> 26:09.167
"Oh, my God, I feel like
you didn't really give it,"

26:09.267 --> 26:11.503
is because you were
talking a really,

26:11.603 --> 26:12.904
really, really big game...

26:13.004 --> 26:14.105
- Yeah.
- Before the LaLaPaRuza.

26:14.205 --> 26:15.173
I found it funny
that those girls were

26:15.273 --> 26:16.675
saying that
because none of them are

26:16.775 --> 26:17.943
in the finale,
none of them would've held

26:18.043 --> 26:19.377
a candle to either of us.
all: Ooh!

26:19.477 --> 26:21.446
I was just answering
the question that was asked.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.348
I mean, we see who's
at the end and who's not.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.317
[laughter]

26:25.417 --> 26:27.052
Well, as they say,

26:27.152 --> 26:29.254
all is fair
in love and lip syncs.

26:29.354 --> 26:31.222
And speaking of love...

26:31.323 --> 26:33.224
[gasps and oohs]

26:33.325 --> 26:36.728
This season, Robin Fierce
and Amethyst admitted

26:36.828 --> 26:38.730
to a preshow romance.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.498
[gasps] - Let's take a look.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.668
Now, Miss Robin, I think it's
time you spill the beans

26:43.768 --> 26:46.071
about you and Miss Amethyst.

26:46.171 --> 26:49.608
So Robin mentioned it
in "Untucked" that

26:49.708 --> 26:50.976
we used to date.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.278
There was a time that me

26:53.378 --> 26:55.914
and Amethyst dated
for a short--

26:56.014 --> 26:56.948
- Stop!
- Stop!

26:57.048 --> 26:58.416
A short time.

26:58.516 --> 26:59.784
Scissor sister.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.252
[laughter]

27:01.353 --> 27:02.821
I feel like it was mutual.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.489
- We both had our own--
- They always say that.

27:04.589 --> 27:06.591
Robin said you wouldn't
text her back.

27:06.691 --> 27:08.994
[all exclaim]

27:09.094 --> 27:10.061
Wait.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.764
No, I said she's a bad texter

27:12.864 --> 27:15.834
and I am busy, bitch.
Okay?

27:15.934 --> 27:18.570
I will admit,
it was my decision

27:18.670 --> 27:20.939
to not pursue things further.

27:21.039 --> 27:23.441
Ultimately, I think we were
looking for different things.

27:23.541 --> 27:24.809
And that's fine.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.612
As of right now,
that chapter is closed

27:27.712 --> 27:29.781
and will not be opening up

27:29.881 --> 27:32.017
any time soon for me.

27:33.518 --> 27:36.354
Okay, Robin. What do you have
to say about that?

27:36.454 --> 27:39.190
I think that I remember
things how they happened

27:39.290 --> 27:41.826
and some people have
drag delusion, you know?

27:41.926 --> 27:43.662
It just is what it is.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.897
Consider that stolen.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.533
[laughter]

27:48.633 --> 27:50.802
Amethyst,
what do you have to say?

27:50.902 --> 27:52.737
The chapter is closed.
That's what I have to say.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.039
All right.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.107
So what advice do you have
for a queen

27:56.207 --> 27:57.942
dating another queen?

27:59.110 --> 28:00.345
Don't shit where you sleep.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.614
Okay.
Have any of you other girls

28:02.714 --> 28:04.149
dated other queens?

28:04.249 --> 28:05.650
I turn the boys I date
into queens.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.752
Yeah, they're all queens eventually.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.389
I mean, all roads lead
to drag queens, right?

28:11.489 --> 28:12.691
Now, listen, kids.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.926
- I am the yenta of drag.
- Oh.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.862
So I wanna know,
are there any other crushes

28:17.962 --> 28:20.165
that you kids had that
I should know about?

28:20.265 --> 28:21.633
- Aura?
- Yeah?

28:21.733 --> 28:22.867
[laughter]

28:22.967 --> 28:26.705
Not very pointed there, Ru.
[laughter]

28:26.805 --> 28:30.175
I'm gonna have to say I had
a little crush on Poppy.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.976
- Ahh!
- Oh, wow.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.678
Do you guys remember
when Poppy left,

28:33.778 --> 28:35.146
and she left a note,

28:35.246 --> 28:37.615
and I think Mistress flipped
that paper and the note.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.983
And what did it say, Mistress?

28:39.084 --> 28:40.585
It said,
"Aura, please fuck me."

28:40.685 --> 28:43.088
[laughter]

28:43.188 --> 28:45.290
Poppy, do you still feel
the same way?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.424
No, not this.

28:46.524 --> 28:47.859
I'm embarrassed.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.194
[laughs]

28:49.294 --> 28:51.029
Yeah, it's 7 inches. Why not?

28:51.129 --> 28:53.231
[laughter]

28:53.331 --> 28:55.600
Aura, is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

28:55.700 --> 28:57.168
Yes.
I have a big announcement.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.138
Speaking of love,
I'm actually getting married.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.473
I got engaged.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.941
[all exclaim]

29:03.041 --> 29:04.509
[laughter]

29:04.609 --> 29:06.277
Everyone's still
on the guest list.

29:06.377 --> 29:08.513
For gifts,
don't send me anything.

29:08.613 --> 29:12.784
Just donate to
the ACLU Drag Defense Fund.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.052
- That's great.
- Yes.

29:14.152 --> 29:16.154
Thank you, ladies.
Let's take a break.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.589
We're gonna be right back
with more

29:17.689 --> 29:20.291
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."
after this.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.392
[RuPaul's "Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent"]

29:21.493 --> 29:23.294
[singing]
Charisma, uniqueness

29:23.394 --> 29:26.131
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

29:26.231 --> 29:29.501
Now, ladykins,
we have fan questions.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.069
[gasps] - Ooh.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.138
First up,
from Drag Race Live

29:33.238 --> 29:35.006
at Flamingo Las Vegas,

29:35.106 --> 29:37.909
it's Coco Montrese.

29:38.009 --> 29:40.111
I have a question for Marcia.

29:40.211 --> 29:43.281
Marcia, how are your makeup
skills these days?

29:43.381 --> 29:46.718
Oh, and girl,
how fuckin' orange do I look?

29:46.818 --> 29:49.621
[laughter]

29:49.721 --> 29:51.489
I would say that my makeup
skills have

29:51.589 --> 29:53.625
- most definitely improved.
- Absolutely.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.494
Seeing yourself on TV
teaches you a lot.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.729
And I'm very excited
to announce

29:57.829 --> 29:59.397
a new project coming up.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.834
Marcia x3 Cosmetics
is launching very soon.

30:02.934 --> 30:06.971
It is some of my favorite
signature products.

30:07.071 --> 30:08.106
Okay, cool.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.074
Is it just eyeliner?
[laughter]

30:10.175 --> 30:12.243
There is some ChapStick
in there too.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.179
Oh, I love that.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.580
Next question.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.115
Hi. It's Asia O'Hara,

30:17.215 --> 30:18.983
and I have a question
for Sasha Colby.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.252
Now, you are indeed
every drag queen's

30:21.352 --> 30:22.453
favorite drag queen,

30:22.554 --> 30:24.422
but who is your
favorite drag queen?

30:24.522 --> 30:25.857
And you can only pick one.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.258
Oh!

30:27.358 --> 30:28.927
It's gonna be a lot
of my friends are gonna

30:29.027 --> 30:31.763
be really upset with this
if I don't say their names.

30:31.863 --> 30:36.801
But my most inspirational
drag performer would

30:36.901 --> 30:38.536
have to be Monica Munro.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.638
She is a former
Miss Continental--

30:40.738 --> 30:42.073
Continental 1994.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.210
And if you YouTuber her,
it's pretty much

30:45.310 --> 30:47.312
my whole drag
for the past 20 years.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.480
- Thank you, Monica.
- All right.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.049
Next question.

30:51.149 --> 30:53.418
Hi, I'm DeJa Skye
from Fresno, California,

30:53.518 --> 30:58.323
and I have a burning question
for the diva Robin Fierce.

30:58.423 --> 31:02.660
Now, mama, I'm in the market
for a new flat-screen TV.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.929
Can you give me
the drag discount?

31:05.029 --> 31:07.532
We could get her
a good 75-inch, bitch.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.267
I could sneak it out
the back door.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.835
[laughs] - Ooh.

31:10.935 --> 31:13.338
So, Robin,
you work at Best Buy,

31:13.438 --> 31:14.606
- is that right?
- I used to.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.443
[laughter]

31:18.543 --> 31:20.178
Oh, my God.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.447
This is when I took forever
to do my makeup.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.083
So I would wake up
early as hell in the morning,

31:25.183 --> 31:27.285
do the makeup,
go to work like this,

31:27.385 --> 31:29.921
and then I would go
to the gigs right after,

31:30.021 --> 31:31.422
'cause a bitch gotta work.

31:31.522 --> 31:35.059
Did you sell more in drag
than when you weren't in drag?

31:35.159 --> 31:36.928
I think I sold about
the same.

31:37.028 --> 31:39.964
Some people didn't realize
I was a drag queen.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.000
They would come in and be like,
"Hey, who's that lady that

31:42.100 --> 31:43.935
I talked to yesterday?
She was so lovely."

31:44.035 --> 31:46.604
And then they would point to me
and I would just be like,

31:46.704 --> 31:48.506
"Hi."
[laughter]

31:48.606 --> 31:50.708
- Out of drag.
- Thank you for that.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.176
Next question.

31:52.277 --> 31:53.678
Hi, it's me, Aquaria--

31:53.778 --> 31:56.347
the bitch from New York City
and winner of season 10.

31:56.447 --> 31:59.918
Irene Dubois, you were trolling
all your cast members

32:00.018 --> 32:01.185
all season online.

32:01.286 --> 32:04.322
Is it true that any troll
is a goal?

32:05.823 --> 32:07.592
I just--I don't take
things seriously.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.661
I love to have fun
with the girlies online.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.396
I love to have fun with them
in the Werkroom, too,

32:11.496 --> 32:14.265
but I didn't get a chance,
so online was all I had, girls.

32:14.365 --> 32:15.266
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

32:15.366 --> 32:16.734
So which of you queens felt

32:16.834 --> 32:18.636
that Irene came for them?

32:18.736 --> 32:20.004
I blocked her.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.839
[all exclaim]

32:21.940 --> 32:24.075
[laughter]

32:24.175 --> 32:25.710
- Are you for real?
- No.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.111
Wait, who's Irene?
I'm kidding.

32:27.211 --> 32:29.213
- Lying like usual.
- I think Irene literally--

32:29.314 --> 32:30.648
every girl that
walked in that door,

32:30.748 --> 32:31.683
- Irene came for them.
- Yes.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.584
We just seen the one.
[laughs]

32:33.685 --> 32:36.020
Was anybody offended
by what she said?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.388
I mean, I don't think
it really matter

32:37.488 --> 32:39.657
if we were offended,
'cause I guess karma got her.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.192
- [laughter]
- Oh!

32:41.292 --> 32:43.328
Still won more money than
you did this season, bitch.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.396
Ahh!
[laughter]

32:45.496 --> 32:47.765
I have to say, I remember
after the first day

32:47.865 --> 32:50.201
meeting Irene, I went over
to Spice and I was like,

32:50.301 --> 32:52.303
"They casting some mean queens
this season."

32:52.403 --> 32:55.273
But honestly, once I really
got to know her,

32:55.373 --> 32:57.475
there is a heart under
all that crazy.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.510
- There really is.
- Thank you.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.813
All right.
Let's go to the next question.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.314
Hey. It's Derrick Barry, bitch.

33:03.414 --> 33:05.883
And I have a question
for Loosey.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.885
So based on some
of your tweets,

33:07.986 --> 33:11.155
are you a queen who
blames it on the edit?

33:12.390 --> 33:13.725
I was hacked!

33:13.825 --> 33:15.994
[laughter]

33:16.094 --> 33:18.096
- Down.
- Yes, of course.

33:18.196 --> 33:21.466
Do you feel the way you were
portrayed in the competition

33:21.566 --> 33:23.001
is who you are?

33:23.101 --> 33:24.602
I think that it showed

33:24.702 --> 33:27.372
a very specific side
to who I am,

33:27.472 --> 33:31.209
but didn't show every aspect
of who I am, you know?

33:31.309 --> 33:34.112
I know that I came off uptight,

33:34.212 --> 33:36.714
but now I've let loose,
and all of that is gone.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.416
Okay. All right.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.085
And moms have questions too.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.587
Ooh.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.088
- Hi.
- Ahh! That's my mom!

33:44.188 --> 33:45.857
I'm Robin Fierce's mom, Rhonda,

33:45.957 --> 33:47.658
and I have a question.

33:47.759 --> 33:51.362
Mistress, why were you coming
for my child about her wig

33:51.462 --> 33:53.831
- in the first episode?
- Oh!

33:53.931 --> 33:55.033
Lace was reflecting

33:55.133 --> 33:56.768
from the duct tape
under the cap.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.369
Prep is everything in drag.

33:58.469 --> 33:59.804
She should have wore
a wig cap.

33:59.904 --> 34:01.139
Vinyl duct tape
with all the lighting

34:01.239 --> 34:02.473
was a no-no, baby.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.942
Are you jealous of her,
Boogie?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.711
Hey, Robin.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.946
Thank you, Mama.
[laughs]

34:09.047 --> 34:11.249
Well, there's
a very simple explanation.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.651
I was in my chaotic era
when I first came in,

34:13.751 --> 34:14.886
so that was the old me.

34:14.986 --> 34:16.854
We're in a new era--
my angelic era.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.089
- Oh.
- Very congenial.

34:18.189 --> 34:21.125
So I'm sending you and Robin
my kisses.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.127
And if you didn't like it,

34:23.227 --> 34:25.363
have a blessed night,
as will I.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.131
[laughter]

34:27.231 --> 34:28.132
Okay.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.002
Other moms have questions too.

34:31.102 --> 34:32.437
Hi, everyone.

34:32.537 --> 34:33.771
I'm Jane, Aura's mom,

34:33.871 --> 34:35.706
and I have a question
for Spice.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.976
Why did you say Aura should
have been in the bottom

34:39.077 --> 34:40.244
for Snatch Game?

34:40.344 --> 34:42.213
Don't you know she would have
sent you home

34:42.313 --> 34:43.448
in the lip sync?

34:43.548 --> 34:45.917
Ahh!

34:46.017 --> 34:47.952
Oh, my God. Mom.

34:48.052 --> 34:50.354
Oh, okay. Wait.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.456
Ooh.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.257
The moms are spicy, bitch.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.059
I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.260
You know what?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.529
Watching that back,
I remember I texted you.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.231
I was like,
"Oh, girl, I didn't s--

35:00.331 --> 35:01.566
It wasn't you
I was talking about."

35:01.666 --> 35:02.767
And then I was like,
I said it was you.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.235
And then I was like,
what did I say?

35:04.335 --> 35:05.670
'Cause I was talking
about someone--

35:05.770 --> 35:08.039
I don't even know,
but, you know, you know.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.441
But you would have
ate me up for sure. [laughs]

35:10.541 --> 35:12.643
So Spice,
are you speaking English?

35:12.743 --> 35:14.712
- [laughter]
- She's speaking Long Island.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.514
You're speaking your
"hot and bored" language.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.748
Yes.

35:17.849 --> 35:18.916
The hot and bored girlies
will know.

35:19.016 --> 35:19.884
They're, like, tuning in
to the frequency.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.018
- You know.
- Well, good.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.520
I'm glad we got that sorted.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.589
[laughter]

35:24.689 --> 35:26.791
And we'll be right back
after this.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.092
[RuPaul's "U Wear it Well"]

35:28.192 --> 35:29.227
[singing]
You wear it well

35:29.327 --> 35:30.628
Welcome back.

35:30.728 --> 35:34.265
This season featured our
biggest reading challenge ever.

35:34.365 --> 35:37.802
Still, some of the reads
were never seen until now.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.036
Take a look.

35:40.104 --> 35:42.240
[inhales] Okay.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.941
The Robin Fierce.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.409
You know, after your run here,

35:45.510 --> 35:48.412
you might have to change
your name to the Robin "Fine."

35:48.513 --> 35:49.914
[laughter]

35:50.014 --> 35:51.149
Werk.

35:51.249 --> 35:53.951
Jax, I love
watching you flip...

35:54.051 --> 35:55.786
from the top two
to the bottom three.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.288
Oh, with you, girl.

35:57.388 --> 35:59.257
[laughter]

35:59.357 --> 36:01.225
Oh, Luxx, I love your gap.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.060
- Thanks.
- And I'm talking about the gap

36:03.161 --> 36:04.629
between your beauty
and your brain.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.030
[laughter]

36:06.130 --> 36:08.399
Blair St. Clair.
[laughter]

36:08.499 --> 36:09.667
I forgot. I'm sorry.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.569
Blu Hydrangea--
oh, my gosh.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.238
Fuck, I'm getting
my twinks mixed up.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.307
You know the difference between
Mistress and a brick?

36:16.407 --> 36:17.942
- No. What?
- A brick gets laid.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.411
[laughter]

36:20.511 --> 36:23.281
Now, Sasha,
I know that the pineapple

36:23.381 --> 36:24.415
is a sign of welcome.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.650
Is that why you have
one tattooed

36:25.750 --> 36:27.451
- on the inside of your lip?
- Ooh.

36:27.552 --> 36:28.953
[laughter]

36:29.053 --> 36:31.956
Luxx Noir London,
your teeth are so fucked up,

36:32.056 --> 36:34.825
your tongue looks like
it's behind bars.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.093
It's only one gap.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.296
[laughter]

36:38.396 --> 36:40.031
Anetra, we get it.

36:40.131 --> 36:41.399
You can walk the duck.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.668
But can you talk... period?

36:43.768 --> 36:44.669
[laughter]

36:44.769 --> 36:45.770
Aura Mayari,

36:45.870 --> 36:48.873
more like
"bore to my eyes, eek."

36:48.973 --> 36:51.409
[laughter]

36:51.509 --> 36:54.111
Spice--you need some.

36:55.012 --> 36:56.414
Mammethyst--uh, Amethyst.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.682
No! No!

36:57.782 --> 36:59.183
Now, not a lot of people
know this,

36:59.283 --> 37:01.185
but when Amethyst first
started drag a month ago,

37:01.285 --> 37:03.554
she expressed interest
in being my drag daughter.

37:03.654 --> 37:05.556
And after seeing you
in this competition,

37:05.656 --> 37:07.725
I can truly say
that will never happen.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.994
[laughter]

37:10.094 --> 37:12.363
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.832
I didn't know they made
a Fat Albert baby doll.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.935
And I didn't know they made
a fat Cabbage Patch.

37:18.035 --> 37:20.538
- [laughter]
- Oh.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.207
- Y'all cut up.
- Damn.

37:23.307 --> 37:24.508
Okay, ladies.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.143
For the queens who didn't
get a chance

37:26.244 --> 37:27.678
to read this season,

37:27.778 --> 37:29.914
the library is about
to reopen.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.649
Up first, Sugar.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.317
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.920
- Daughter, gather them.
- Okay.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.289
Miss Mother, hopefully
I make you proud.

37:38.389 --> 37:42.727
Irene, Luxx coined you as
the swamp witch of the season.

37:42.827 --> 37:44.095
She's absolutely right,

37:44.195 --> 37:46.197
because what witchcraft
did you pull

37:46.297 --> 37:47.765
to only be in one episode
and still get

37:47.865 --> 37:48.866
more screentime than Robin?

37:48.966 --> 37:51.836
[laughter and shouting]

37:53.204 --> 37:54.338
Clock that tea.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.307
- Damn.
- Well, now that you went,

37:56.407 --> 37:57.541
maybe I should do
a little read for you,

37:57.642 --> 37:58.676
'cause I never got to read you.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.144
- Ooh.
- Yes, ma'am.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.580
My sweet Sugar, you know,

38:02.680 --> 38:04.915
you and Michelle Visage
actually have a lot in common.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.217
- Oh.
- You know,

38:06.317 --> 38:07.785
living in someone else's
shadow.

38:07.885 --> 38:10.254
[laughter]

38:10.354 --> 38:11.422
Princess Poppy.

38:11.522 --> 38:13.624
Aura Mayari,
all of those muscles

38:13.724 --> 38:15.559
and only your ass is ripped.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.629
[laughter and shouting]

38:18.729 --> 38:20.064
You would know.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.932
And the rumors are true.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.968
I did give someone
on set COVID.

38:24.068 --> 38:27.505
That's why all season long,
Loosey LaDuca had no taste.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.674
[laughter and shouting]

38:30.775 --> 38:32.043
- Irene.
- Okay.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.445
Sasha Colby, Michelle Visage
said that you are

38:34.545 --> 38:36.580
a whole lot more than a body,

38:36.681 --> 38:38.115
and she's absolutely right.

38:38.215 --> 38:40.551
There's also about
eight syringes of lip filler

38:40.651 --> 38:42.486
and two buckets
of industrial-grade silicone

38:42.586 --> 38:43.721
in your ass.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.524
That's you.
[laughter]

38:46.624 --> 38:48.492
Salina EsTitties,
I have met drag queens

38:48.592 --> 38:51.929
with fake asses, fake titties,
fake lashes,

38:52.029 --> 38:54.065
but you're the first one I've
ever met with a fake accent.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.200
[laughter]

38:56.300 --> 38:57.735
Okay, white girl.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.170
- Let me do a couple.
- All right.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.038
Amethyst,
or as Robin Fierce knows you,

39:01.138 --> 39:02.340
arm and fist.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.641
- Ooh.
- Oh.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.643
And
Mistress Isabelle Brookes,

39:05.743 --> 39:07.111
the only thing shorter
than those heels

39:07.211 --> 39:08.646
is that life expectancy.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.748
- [laughter]
- Okay, ladies.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.718
The library is closed--
officially.

39:13.818 --> 39:16.520
Now, because reading
is fundamental,

39:16.620 --> 39:20.591
I'm happy to announce
"And Don't F$%k it Up:

39:20.691 --> 39:23.194
An Oral History
of RuPaul's Drag Race"

39:23.294 --> 39:28.032
is available this June,
wherever fine books are sold.

39:28.132 --> 39:31.068
Now, where's the--
where's that book?

39:32.002 --> 39:34.038
- Oh.
- Ooh. Ooh.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.206
Yeah. Uh-huh.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.907
See, Mistress,
that's why I can't have

39:37.007 --> 39:39.009
a damn thing nice.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.611
I enjoyed it, though.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.046
I didn't know you knew
how to read.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.948
[laughter]

39:44.048 --> 39:46.350
You know, the queens
always create drama,

39:46.450 --> 39:50.454
but this season had a series
of "gates."

39:50.554 --> 39:51.856
Take a look.

39:51.956 --> 39:55.726
We personally would love
to go with metal.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.228
Does that conflict
with anybody?

39:57.328 --> 39:58.295
- We want--
- We want metal.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.764
We wanna do heavy metal.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.565
[dramatic music]

40:01.665 --> 40:02.900
Okay, well,
we're doing metal,

40:03.000 --> 40:04.034
So I guess it leaves them
with country.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.269
- We want metal.
- We're gonna do metal.

40:05.369 --> 40:06.537
I think we're gonna
do metal, yeah.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.739
I think that we should
just get metal, period.

40:08.839 --> 40:11.475
Like, why do you guys think
you can do heavy metal?

40:11.575 --> 40:13.844
I'm literally already wearing
the heavy metal hat.

40:13.944 --> 40:15.279
I'm not taking it off.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.915
It is Metalgate, baby.

40:18.015 --> 40:19.884
The reason why I stood
my ground is because

40:19.984 --> 40:21.952
I felt like their group
was being bullies.

40:23.521 --> 40:24.855
I apologize if I made you
feel that way,

40:24.955 --> 40:26.357
because that was not my intent.

40:26.457 --> 40:28.125
And if you don't feel like
talking right now, that's fine.

40:28.225 --> 40:30.528
That's all you gotta say.

40:30.628 --> 40:31.562
[laughs]

40:31.662 --> 40:32.797
It's not funny.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.231
I'm laughing 'cause
it's fucking awkward

40:34.331 --> 40:36.634
because we were already
in [indistinct] bitch.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.002
Now you're trying
to piss me off?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.537
I apologize if I made you
feel that way,

40:39.637 --> 40:41.572
but at the end of the day,
I'm not gonna apologize

40:41.672 --> 40:43.641
for how I felt in that moment
and for how it went.

40:43.741 --> 40:44.809
And that's the same way.

40:44.909 --> 40:46.911
And that's why I said
what I said.

40:49.079 --> 40:50.247
Oh.

40:50.347 --> 40:51.882
BeyoncÃ© looks are really fun.

40:51.982 --> 40:53.217
I loved wearing my look.

40:53.317 --> 40:54.452
I felt really,
really beautiful in it.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.154
Why weren't you pregnant, though?

40:57.254 --> 40:58.889
I--she wasn't very far along

40:58.989 --> 41:00.758
when she announced
her pregnancy.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.026
You could see the bump
on the red carpet

41:02.126 --> 41:03.294
in the orange dress,

41:03.394 --> 41:04.595
and you could see it
in the performance.

41:04.695 --> 41:07.164
I feel like you're insulting
Bey right now,

41:07.264 --> 41:08.833
- and, like, I don't want that.
- I'm not insulting her

41:08.933 --> 41:10.201
'cause she actually was pregnant.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.603
I'm insulting you
'cause you had a corset on.

41:12.703 --> 41:15.506
But she wasn't showing
in her pregnancy.

41:15.606 --> 41:16.707
You can go back and look.

41:16.807 --> 41:17.842
I don't have to,
'cause I know.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.443
I know, too,
'cause I did the look.

41:21.245 --> 41:23.314
The two roles that
I would wanna do

41:23.414 --> 41:25.416
are Heaven and Christian.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.584
I would also--

41:26.684 --> 41:28.786
I'm also very interested
in Heaven.

41:28.886 --> 41:30.921
Okay, so who's gonna
be Heaven?

41:31.021 --> 41:32.122
I'm gonna be Heaven.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.124
I would really like
to be Heaven.

41:34.225 --> 41:38.429
My energy is very much like
this character of Heaven.

41:38.529 --> 41:41.265
I don't--
I don't really see that.

41:41.365 --> 41:42.900
I don't see it for you.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.035
I want Heaven.
"No, I want Heaven."

41:45.135 --> 41:46.570
Welcome to Heavengate.

41:47.705 --> 41:49.573
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

41:49.673 --> 41:52.443
Let's first start
with Metalgate.

41:52.543 --> 41:55.346
Malaysia, why was getting metal
so important to you?

41:55.446 --> 41:57.515
Honestly, just where
I've come from,

41:57.615 --> 42:00.017
I've always had to, like,
prove myself.

42:00.117 --> 42:01.385
And I think at that point, like,

42:01.485 --> 42:03.454
with Mistress and Luxx,
it triggered me

42:03.554 --> 42:05.890
because I was thinking about
a lot of things from back home,

42:05.990 --> 42:07.324
because I know,
watching it back,

42:07.424 --> 42:08.459
that they were having
a good time

42:08.559 --> 42:10.027
and they were just trolling me.

42:11.695 --> 42:12.863
Definitely Mistress.

42:12.963 --> 42:14.665
And I can say that me
and Luxx weren't--

42:14.765 --> 42:16.033
we didn't have that same,
like--

42:16.133 --> 42:17.067
- Rapport.
- That--yeah.

42:17.167 --> 42:18.669
That me and Mistress had.

42:18.769 --> 42:21.338
Then I didn't understand your
personality and your sarcasm,

42:21.438 --> 42:23.440
and you have a very dry
sense of humor.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.508
- Very true.
- So for me,

42:24.608 --> 42:25.943
everything that you said
or anything,

42:26.043 --> 42:27.578
it was, like,
taken very seriously.

42:27.678 --> 42:29.413
So in that moment,
I was just like,

42:29.513 --> 42:31.181
"No, bitch.
I'm not backing down."

42:31.282 --> 42:33.784
My biggest regret was, like,
calling them bullies,

42:33.884 --> 42:35.352
'cause I know that sometimes
that word can

42:35.452 --> 42:38.088
be a trigger,
especially for the fanbase,

42:38.188 --> 42:41.225
and easily make them targets,
and they are far from that.

42:41.325 --> 42:43.460
So, Mistress,
what's your take on this?

42:43.561 --> 42:44.628
Malaysia's my sister.

42:44.728 --> 42:45.829
We had that rapport already

42:45.930 --> 42:46.931
at this point
in the competition,

42:47.031 --> 42:48.165
and I actually didn't know

42:48.265 --> 42:49.199
that they were being serious,

42:49.300 --> 42:50.801
they were actually upset
about it,

42:50.901 --> 42:52.069
till the "Untucked" happened.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.571
You also like to push
people's buttons.

42:53.671 --> 42:54.838
Yeah, no, of course.
I was having a good time.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.307
That's what she said.
Like, it was all in fun.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.741
That's why when it got
to the point

42:57.841 --> 42:59.243
where I kind of pushed her
too much,

42:59.343 --> 43:01.512
I knew where it was coming
from and I wish that

43:01.612 --> 43:02.980
we could have talked it out
in that moment.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.149
But also, we're kind
of the same person

43:05.249 --> 43:06.917
where when we're upset
it's don't talk to us,

43:07.017 --> 43:08.986
because bitch will be ready
to pop off.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.120
Okay. All right.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.691
Now, next up,
BeyoncÃ© Baby Bumpgate.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.794
Loosey and Luxx,
for the sake of the baby,

43:16.894 --> 43:17.995
who was right?

43:18.095 --> 43:19.463
- I was right.
- Luxx was right.

43:19.563 --> 43:21.532
- [laughter]
- Yay!

43:21.632 --> 43:23.734
The only thing I take
a little bit of an issue with

43:23.834 --> 43:25.102
is that you claim that
I wore a corset.

43:25.202 --> 43:26.637
I have never worn a corset
in my life.

43:26.737 --> 43:27.705
You know that.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.006
I may have misspoke.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.374
I didn't mean to call it
a corset.

43:30.474 --> 43:32.209
Maybe you were just
wearing a shaper.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.044
Okay.
[laughs]

43:34.144 --> 43:35.846
Next up, Heavengate.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.617
When it came to choosing roles
in "Wigloose,"

43:39.717 --> 43:41.819
things got tight.

43:41.919 --> 43:46.457
Loosey, why do you think
the girls are coming for you?

43:46.557 --> 43:47.925
I--I couldn't tell you.

43:48.025 --> 43:50.194
The reason why I was so upset
with Mistress at the time

43:50.294 --> 43:52.396
is that you had your role.
You were sitting pretty.

43:52.496 --> 43:54.064
Like, you should have been
just good and happy.

43:54.164 --> 43:55.399
So then when Luxx and I were

43:55.499 --> 43:56.700
discussing who should
get the role,

43:56.800 --> 43:58.902
I was like,
"Why is Mistress in this now?"

43:59.003 --> 44:00.371
Like, why she gotta cut up?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.672
I think, for me,
it was the constant bickering.

44:01.772 --> 44:02.940
It's like, girl,
let's just decide

44:03.040 --> 44:04.541
who does the fuckin' role,
but also--

44:04.642 --> 44:06.343
You made the bickering worse,
though, girl.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.811
I--of course. I'm Mistress.

44:07.911 --> 44:10.381
That's what I do.
[laughter]

44:10.481 --> 44:12.816
Why did you think Loosey
was being fake?

44:12.916 --> 44:14.585
Through the whole competition
or this moment?

44:14.685 --> 44:15.786
[laughter]

44:15.886 --> 44:17.221
I'm not even trying
to be funny.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.555
- I'm being serious.
- No.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.790
- During the exchange.
- In this moment?

44:19.890 --> 44:21.492
'Cause--so it kind of showed

44:21.592 --> 44:22.726
and played through in the show.

44:22.826 --> 44:23.861
In real life she was saying,
you know,

44:23.961 --> 44:25.095
"I identify
with this character.

44:25.195 --> 44:26.864
This is me,"
but the character description

44:26.964 --> 44:28.565
is someone young
and all this other stuff

44:28.666 --> 44:31.235
like--I mean,
that sounds so shady.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.736
I'm not saying you're
a old-ass bitch.

44:32.836 --> 44:33.937
That's not what I'm saying.

44:34.038 --> 44:35.673
I think you just did.
[laughter]

44:35.773 --> 44:38.475
So, Luxx, why did you
eventually give the role up?

44:38.575 --> 44:41.445
I feel like people have
tried to twist it to me,

44:41.545 --> 44:44.148
like, trying to twist
some sort of mind game.

44:44.248 --> 44:47.051
I genuinely just saw that
Loosey was

44:47.151 --> 44:48.852
very upset that she didn't
get the role.

44:48.952 --> 44:50.554
So let me just give her
the role so everybody's happy,

44:50.654 --> 44:53.123
because at the end of the day
we all have to work together.

44:53.223 --> 44:56.460
But also,
from a strategy standpoint,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.662
if she was to flub at the lead,

44:58.762 --> 45:00.364
it would be a bigger flub
on her part.

45:00.464 --> 45:01.865
- Oh.
- But that's just--

45:01.965 --> 45:03.500
that wasn't even, like,
my main frame of thinking.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.536
It was just a side frame
of thinking?

45:05.636 --> 45:07.104
I kind of thought of that
after the fact.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.639
- Ah.
- But I was like, hmm.

45:08.739 --> 45:11.442
Now, Anetra, how did you feel
about Heaven's Gate?

45:11.542 --> 45:13.277
I loved all of it.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.013
Just 'cause, like, drag queens
fighting over anything

45:16.113 --> 45:17.915
is always entertaining.

45:18.015 --> 45:20.284
Well, ladies,
the Rusical turned out

45:20.384 --> 45:21.752
to be so fabulous.

45:21.852 --> 45:23.954
It's something you can all
be proud of.

45:24.054 --> 45:28.058
And last but not least,
the 40-inchgate.

45:29.026 --> 45:30.227
- Luxx!
- Yes?

45:30.327 --> 45:31.662
- Do you know what this is?
- Oh, my God.

45:31.762 --> 45:34.598
A 40-inch unit, I guess.
[laughter]

45:34.698 --> 45:36.366
Wait, I think I have
a measuring tape.

45:36.467 --> 45:37.735
Are we really about
to do this?

45:37.835 --> 45:38.969
Yeah. Let's find out.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.804
Yours is definitely
longer than mine,

45:40.904 --> 45:41.839
but they're close.

45:41.939 --> 45:43.774
Well, this is 40 inches.

45:43.874 --> 45:46.977
Yours truly is probably,
like, the same length.

45:47.077 --> 45:49.146
Yours just gets a little, like,
withered at the end.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.915
Withered.
[laughter]

45:52.015 --> 45:53.851
- Withered.
- Now, was your weave

45:53.951 --> 45:55.986
40 inches or not, Luxx?

45:56.086 --> 45:57.588
- You know--
- It wasn't.

45:57.688 --> 46:01.692
In school, they teach you
if you have a number over 35,

46:01.792 --> 46:05.129
you round to the nearest ten, right?

46:05.229 --> 46:06.930
Well, I'd love to get
to the bottom of it right now.

46:07.030 --> 46:08.866
[all exclaim]

46:08.966 --> 46:10.601
Wait. I do have something
you can measure.

46:10.701 --> 46:12.536
You can measure these legs.

46:12.636 --> 46:14.538
[laughter]

46:14.638 --> 46:16.240
I just wanna say,
in that moment,

46:16.340 --> 46:18.442
I genuinely, like, as a sister,

46:18.542 --> 46:21.111
was trying to look out
for my new friend

46:21.211 --> 46:23.180
because I wanted to know
who had sold you

46:23.280 --> 46:26.483
that 32-inch wig
and told you it was 40!

46:26.583 --> 46:28.252
Hey, listen.
You watch your mouth.

46:28.352 --> 46:31.288
My mother hand-made me
that wig, okay?

46:31.388 --> 46:32.723
Your mom needs to get her
eyes checked.

46:32.823 --> 46:35.826
It was a family heirloom.
Thank you.

46:35.926 --> 46:36.927
How dare you--

46:37.027 --> 46:38.562
Oh, that's why it was
so fried.

46:38.662 --> 46:39.930
- Oh.
- No, I'm kidding.

46:40.030 --> 46:41.031
It was a beautiful wig.
It was a beautiful wig.

46:41.131 --> 46:42.232
A beautiful 32-inch wig.

46:42.332 --> 46:44.168
Well, I'm glad
we got that sorted out.

46:44.268 --> 46:46.203
We'll be right back after this.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.339
[singing]
The world is your runway

46:50.440 --> 46:51.675
Welcome back.

46:51.775 --> 46:53.944
Now, we are one week away
from crowning

46:54.044 --> 46:56.446
America's next drag superstar.

46:56.547 --> 46:59.316
Right now, let's talk fashion.

46:59.416 --> 47:02.286
- Ooh.
- Category is unseen looks

47:02.386 --> 47:04.321
from the eliminated queens.

47:04.421 --> 47:05.756
Now, first up, Amethyst.

47:05.856 --> 47:08.125
Rip Her to Shreds.

47:08.225 --> 47:09.827
- Oh, she's silly.
- Oh, my gosh.

47:09.927 --> 47:11.094
Tell us about this, Amethyst.

47:11.195 --> 47:12.663
This is actually a reference

47:12.763 --> 47:14.832
to "Dennis the Menace"
the movie.

47:14.932 --> 47:16.700
There's a really bitchy
office worker

47:16.800 --> 47:18.502
that I wanted to kind of, like,

47:18.602 --> 47:20.370
make a character, like,
off of her.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.172
I love the production
behind it all,

47:22.272 --> 47:23.240
the storyline.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.341
The picture on the right,

47:24.441 --> 47:25.609
it looks like someone
just went--

47:25.709 --> 47:27.511
and you went,
"Oh, not my gumdrop buttons."

47:27.611 --> 47:28.846
You look like you are--

47:28.946 --> 47:29.980
- What?
- I love it.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.548
- The acting, it is--wow.
- All right.

47:31.648 --> 47:35.185
Next up is Aura's
Night of 1,000 BeyoncÃ©s look.

47:35.285 --> 47:36.653
Aura, tell us about this.

47:36.753 --> 47:39.489
First of all, BeyoncÃ©
is my ultimate, like, idol.

47:39.590 --> 47:41.992
And I was so, so, so excited
for this runway

47:42.092 --> 47:43.227
and just too bad
I couldn't--

47:43.327 --> 47:45.596
I couldn't make it
to walk that runway.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.531
This look is amazing, bitch.

47:47.631 --> 47:49.132
I think it's sickening, mama.

47:49.233 --> 47:50.868
Why weren't you pregnant, though?

47:50.968 --> 47:52.703
[laughter]

47:52.803 --> 47:54.171
Mm. Yeah. Yeah.

47:54.271 --> 47:57.441
Next up, Malaysia's
Everybody Say Glove look.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.076
- Ooh.
- Yes.

47:59.176 --> 48:00.310
Oh, my goodness.

48:00.410 --> 48:01.411
All right, Malaysia.
What's the story?

48:01.511 --> 48:03.046
I wanted to make homage
to your line,

48:03.146 --> 48:04.481
"Everybody say love."

48:04.581 --> 48:06.383
And I wear my heart
on my sleeve.

48:06.483 --> 48:08.552
That's why I have the
puffer hearts on the sleeve.

48:08.652 --> 48:10.120
What do you queens think
of this look?

48:10.220 --> 48:12.189
It's kind of giving, like,
sexy Mrs. Claus.

48:12.289 --> 48:13.523
It's, like, really sickening.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.559
It is cute. I love it.

48:15.659 --> 48:16.927
Santa, baby.

48:17.027 --> 48:18.295
Can you put me in touch
with the person

48:18.395 --> 48:19.930
- who retouched this photo?
- Oh!

48:20.030 --> 48:21.765
- Oh. Oh.
- Wow.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.300
Baby, I'm the girl
in the picture.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.301
All right. Next up,

48:24.401 --> 48:26.970
Irene Dubois' Puffer Please.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.906
- Ooh.
- Yes.

48:29.006 --> 48:29.973
Oh, my goodness.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.141
Yeah. Who retouched this?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.710
[laughter]

48:33.810 --> 48:35.379
The best part
about this season

48:35.479 --> 48:36.780
is going onto social media

48:36.880 --> 48:39.082
and seeing what look
you're gonna post.

48:39.182 --> 48:40.384
It's been, like, such a treat.

48:40.484 --> 48:41.885
She's a look queen.

48:41.985 --> 48:42.920
Yeah. Yeah.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.354
Tell us about this look.

48:44.454 --> 48:46.256
So I wanted to go more
vintage with the Puffer look,

48:46.356 --> 48:47.925
so I opted for a cocoon coat,

48:48.025 --> 48:49.660
like,
a Sunset Boulevard moment.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.828
I'm very, very proud
of my package.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.231
And to know my peers appreciate

48:54.331 --> 48:56.166
the work that I put into it,
it really means a lot to me.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.001
- So thank you, guys, so much.
- All right.

48:58.101 --> 49:01.071
It's time to play
America's favorite game--

49:01.171 --> 49:02.606
Toot or Boot.

49:02.706 --> 49:04.074
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, boy.

49:04.174 --> 49:06.610
Now, I'll show you a look
of this season.

49:06.710 --> 49:07.911
If you like it, toot it.

49:08.011 --> 49:09.379
If you don't, boot it.

49:09.479 --> 49:10.714
- Here we go.
- Oh, no.

49:10.814 --> 49:14.418
Up first, Sasha Colby's
Puffer Please.

49:14.518 --> 49:15.852
Toot or boot?

49:15.953 --> 49:17.387
- all: Toot.
- Tooty-toot-toot.

49:17.487 --> 49:20.324
It's everything that
Sasha embodies.

49:20.424 --> 49:21.658
It's fearless. It's sexy.

49:21.758 --> 49:22.893
It's just everything.

49:22.993 --> 49:23.894
It's so gorgeous.

49:23.994 --> 49:24.962
And a little ho-y underneath.

49:25.062 --> 49:26.396
A little ho-y, of course.

49:26.496 --> 49:28.665
- Well, actually, a lotta ho-y.
- A little?

49:28.765 --> 49:31.034
Up next,
Malaysia's entrance look.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.602
all: Toot.

49:32.703 --> 49:34.071
It's just so cute.
It's bright.

49:34.171 --> 49:36.373
It's everything that I love
about Malaysia.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.809
Marcia's
Beautiful Nightmare.

49:38.909 --> 49:39.977
all: Boot.

49:40.077 --> 49:41.345
Thank you so much, everyone.

49:41.445 --> 49:43.246
Wait, I think I love it.

49:43.347 --> 49:44.948
[laughter]

49:45.048 --> 49:46.750
It's giving me,
like, "Monster High,"

49:46.850 --> 49:48.785
- like, teacher.
- Thank you so much.

49:48.885 --> 49:51.288
Irene, you booted this. Why?

49:51.388 --> 49:54.591
It's... not good.
[laughter]

49:54.691 --> 49:57.127
Up next,
Anetra's Crystallized look.

49:57.227 --> 49:58.628
all: Toot.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.030
- Mad toot.
- Ooh.

50:00.130 --> 50:01.331
Anetra, I will say
this was rude

50:01.431 --> 50:02.499
and you made us all look

50:02.599 --> 50:04.201
rinky-dinky hokey-pokey
next to you.

50:04.301 --> 50:05.435
Wow, it's gorgeous.

50:05.535 --> 50:06.670
Watching her do
all the spikes,

50:06.770 --> 50:07.871
I'm like,
"What did you just, like"--

50:07.971 --> 50:08.905
it was amazing.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.674
Loosey's Bag Ball look.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.042
- Boot!
- Boot.

50:12.142 --> 50:13.276
- I don't know what it is.
- Platform boot.

50:13.377 --> 50:14.578
- Boot! Boot!
- What is that?

50:14.678 --> 50:17.114
This is a toot.
This is a toot.

50:17.214 --> 50:18.482
I think it's
an experimental look

50:18.582 --> 50:19.716
that will surpass time.

50:19.816 --> 50:21.051
People years from now,
they're gonna go,

50:21.151 --> 50:22.819
"That was the one."
[laughter]

50:22.919 --> 50:24.054
Okay.

50:24.154 --> 50:25.689
Yeah, I will tell
my grandchildren

50:25.789 --> 50:27.057
that this is drag. Yeah.

50:27.157 --> 50:28.458
This is drag.

50:28.558 --> 50:30.627
Up next,
Luxx's Crystalized look.

50:30.727 --> 50:31.695
all: Toot.

50:31.795 --> 50:32.996
Shoot. I loved it.

50:33.096 --> 50:34.798
This was actually,
if not my favorite,

50:34.898 --> 50:35.999
in, like, my top two of, like,

50:36.099 --> 50:38.301
anybody's runway
in this entire season.

50:38.402 --> 50:39.703
Thank you.

50:39.803 --> 50:42.139
Fun fact--that is Poppy's wig

50:42.239 --> 50:44.174
that I have with me
right here.

50:44.274 --> 50:45.242
Oh.

50:45.342 --> 50:46.243
[laughter]

50:46.343 --> 50:47.711
I don't, obviously.

50:47.811 --> 50:49.479
I'm never getting it back.

50:49.579 --> 50:52.215
Mistress's
Night of 1,000 BeyoncÃ©s.

50:52.315 --> 50:54.317
- Toot.
- Boot.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.153
I love this picture
of the three of us.

50:56.253 --> 50:58.188
You, me, and Sugar.
[laughter]

50:58.288 --> 50:59.623
- Yeah.
- I'ma boot it.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.625
It's the nude cutouts
on the side for me.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.627
Well, actually,
it's reflective spandex.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.262
If you see, it's all
the same nude.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.030
It is not reflecting
the right color, though.

51:07.130 --> 51:08.498
- It's my shade.
- Ooh.

51:08.598 --> 51:09.699
You know.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.902
Up next, Jax's
Beautiful Nightmare.

51:12.002 --> 51:13.103
- Toot or boot?
- Boot.

51:13.203 --> 51:14.471
Oh. Oh.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.139
I had an entirely different
concept in mind.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.941
Things didn't play out
the way I wanted to,

51:18.041 --> 51:18.975
so boot.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.077
My mom would say growing up,

51:20.177 --> 51:22.345
that girls don't fart,
they fluff.

51:22.446 --> 51:23.914
So you know what?
This is a fluff.

51:24.014 --> 51:25.048
[laughter]

51:25.148 --> 51:26.750
I don't know what that means.

51:26.850 --> 51:29.419
Inside the mind
of Sugar and Spice.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.621
All right. Up next,

51:31.721 --> 51:34.458
Robin Fierce's
Who is She? look.

51:34.558 --> 51:35.659
all: Toot.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.060
- Shoot.
- Gorgeous.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.995
And, Irene, what do you love
about this?

51:39.096 --> 51:40.497
I just think that this
is really--

51:40.597 --> 51:43.900
it's, like, exemplifies
what makes Robin... fierce.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.936
- Fierce.
- You look fabulous.

51:46.036 --> 51:47.404
She looks like
an elegant lady.

51:47.504 --> 51:50.073
I've known Robin her entire
drag career,

51:50.173 --> 51:52.275
and she's always been
so beautiful,

51:52.375 --> 51:53.677
but this was like a--

51:53.777 --> 51:56.680
it was like the final form
of Robin Fierce.

51:56.780 --> 51:58.448
And you just came out
and you just

51:58.548 --> 52:00.750
- absolutely murdered it.
- Thank you.

52:00.851 --> 52:03.286
And finally,
Aura's Beautiful Nightmare.

52:03.386 --> 52:04.454
Toot or boot?

52:04.554 --> 52:06.256
all: Toot.

52:06.356 --> 52:09.025
I'm gonna toot the dress
and boot the acting.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.961
Yeah.
[laughter]

52:11.061 --> 52:12.863
- Very loose quotes, "acting."
- Yeah.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.397
I thought I was killin' it, girl.

52:14.498 --> 52:16.133
Girl, you thought
you were serving.

52:16.233 --> 52:17.400
All right.

52:17.501 --> 52:20.103
In a season
full of sickening fashions,

52:20.203 --> 52:22.139
someone's gotta be the worst.

52:22.239 --> 52:26.910
It's time for the prestigious
Golden Boot Award.

52:27.010 --> 52:30.947
Please welcome last season's
Golden Boot Award winner,

52:31.047 --> 52:33.950
fashion icon Maddy Morphosis.

52:34.050 --> 52:34.951
Ahh!

52:35.051 --> 52:36.386
Thank you, Ru.

52:36.486 --> 52:40.390
Whenever people say it's
an honor just to be nominated,

52:40.490 --> 52:43.326
they probably weren't nominated
for a Golden Boot.

52:43.426 --> 52:44.961
Still, I'm thrilled
to announce

52:45.061 --> 52:47.797
the winner of this season's
Golden Boot Award,

52:47.898 --> 52:51.668
brought to you by got2b--
for whoever you wanna be.

52:51.768 --> 52:52.836
Can someone let Taraji know

52:52.936 --> 52:54.137
that I put a gold chain
on Papi?

52:54.237 --> 52:56.373
[laughter]

52:56.473 --> 52:59.776
And the nominees
are Marcia Marcia Marcia

52:59.876 --> 53:02.279
with her
Tie-Dye to Die for look.

53:02.379 --> 53:05.582
Jax for her
Tie-Dye to Die For look.

53:05.682 --> 53:07.584
That was a rough runway,
wasn't it?

53:08.952 --> 53:13.256
And Salina EsTitties
for her Metallica runway.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.525
And the Golden Boot goes to...

53:15.625 --> 53:18.728
[suspenseful music]

53:22.199 --> 53:24.034
Salina EsTitties.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.903
[cheers and applause]

53:27.003 --> 53:28.805
Oh, pit crew.

53:28.905 --> 53:29.806
Ooh.

53:29.906 --> 53:31.141
- Ooh.
- Okay.

53:31.241 --> 53:33.009
[indistinct chatter]

53:33.109 --> 53:34.477
Thank you, Daddy.

53:34.578 --> 53:36.813
Con-drag-ulations Salina.

53:36.913 --> 53:38.515
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

53:38.615 --> 53:41.218
I finally won something
on "Drag Race"!

53:41.318 --> 53:42.485
[laughter]

53:42.586 --> 53:43.687
We'll be right back.

53:44.988 --> 53:46.690
[singing] Doo doo doo doo doo

53:46.790 --> 53:49.025
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

53:49.125 --> 53:52.362
When I ask the queens
who should go home tonight

53:52.462 --> 53:56.633
and why,
I never know what to expect.

53:56.733 --> 53:57.634
Take a look.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.202
Loosey.

53:59.302 --> 54:01.771
Salina has been
in the bottom a lot.

54:01.871 --> 54:03.607
Anetra.

54:03.707 --> 54:04.674
Salina Es Titties.

54:04.774 --> 54:06.009
Mistress.

54:06.109 --> 54:07.444
If I had to be honest,

54:07.544 --> 54:08.945
I'm tired of being at
the Sasha Colby Meet and Greet.

54:09.045 --> 54:11.681
- Salina!
- I don't see future of drag

54:11.781 --> 54:13.617
when I see Loosey.

54:13.717 --> 54:15.619
- Sasha.
- I would send...

54:15.719 --> 54:17.954
Loosey or Luxx home.

54:18.054 --> 54:20.156
- Luxx.
- You know, I think, really

54:20.257 --> 54:22.592
analyzing the lineup
that we have here tonight,

54:22.692 --> 54:26.062
I would say that Sasha Colby
does drag on a level

54:26.162 --> 54:28.431
that is clean, cut, concise.

54:28.531 --> 54:31.034
But she just puts that little
extra thing on it.

54:31.134 --> 54:33.670
Salina brings something
so unique

54:33.770 --> 54:35.205
with her perspective.

54:35.305 --> 54:36.773
It has so much heart.

54:36.873 --> 54:40.176
Mistress, she also has
a unique spin on what she does,

54:40.277 --> 54:43.280
because she's not afraid
to push the boundary.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.382
That is something
that is very admirable.

54:45.482 --> 54:47.284
You never know what to expect
from Anetra,

54:47.384 --> 54:49.252
and I think that the unexpected

54:49.352 --> 54:51.655
is something that I look for.

54:51.755 --> 54:55.225
Loosey does what she does
exceptionally well.

54:55.325 --> 54:58.295
However, Loosey's drag,
I would have to say,

54:58.395 --> 54:59.896
for a lack of a better word,

54:59.996 --> 55:01.898
is a little on the more
generic side.

55:01.998 --> 55:03.833
Very congenial, aunty.

55:03.933 --> 55:05.368
Everybody else on this lineup

55:05.468 --> 55:07.704
brings something a little
different and unique,

55:07.804 --> 55:10.106
so tonight I'd have to say
Loosey for those reasons.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.643
Okay, first up,

55:13.743 --> 55:17.881
let's go to Ted Talk speaker Luxx...

55:17.981 --> 55:21.318
why did you feel compelled
to name check all the girls?

55:21.418 --> 55:22.852
I genuinely do not know.

55:22.952 --> 55:26.589
In my head, I wanted to give
like rhyme and reason to it,

55:26.690 --> 55:28.792
so that's kind of why I did it.

55:28.892 --> 55:30.160
It was very entertaining.

55:30.260 --> 55:31.828
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:31.928 --> 55:34.831
So Loosey, how did you
feel about Luxx choosing you?

55:34.931 --> 55:36.366
Obviously, not great.

55:36.466 --> 55:39.502
I mean, it sucked, it hurt.
It really hurt.

55:39.602 --> 55:41.104
I don't know
if I necessarily believe

55:41.204 --> 55:44.074
that you didn't go in
knowing what you were gonna do,

55:44.174 --> 55:46.743
'cause it seemed
very premeditated.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.645
I fully didn't.
I'm kinda just really good

55:48.745 --> 55:51.047
at talking on the drop
of a dime.

55:51.147 --> 55:53.783
I just don't think
it was necessary

55:53.883 --> 55:56.353
to punch down so much.

55:56.453 --> 55:59.522
It hurt, it really hurt,
and I respect your opinion.

55:59.622 --> 56:01.658
You can think that I am generic,

56:01.758 --> 56:05.962
but it would have hurt enough
if you just called me generic.

56:06.062 --> 56:08.465
- Mm, mm.
- It really hurt

56:08.565 --> 56:09.833
that you went down the line
and said

56:09.933 --> 56:12.168
this is the reason why
everyone here is a star

56:12.268 --> 56:13.703
except for her.

56:13.803 --> 56:16.940
You seemed to take joy
in doing that.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.376
I did make it a point to say

56:19.476 --> 56:21.077
that what you do,
you do it exceptionally well.

56:21.177 --> 56:23.146
It took a lot of nerve

56:23.246 --> 56:25.548
to say everything I do
has been done before

56:25.648 --> 56:27.317
while wearing a wig

56:27.417 --> 56:29.052
that was on the runway already
on a puppet.

56:29.152 --> 56:30.453
- Ooh!
- I had never said that

56:30.553 --> 56:33.423
everything you had done
had been done before.

56:33.523 --> 56:35.125
Those were the words, Luxx.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.926
Believe me,
it's engrained in my mind.

56:37.026 --> 56:39.162
I never said
everything you've done

56:39.262 --> 56:40.430
has been done before.

56:40.530 --> 56:42.332
- Okay.
- It was inevitable

56:42.432 --> 56:44.300
that somebody's feelings
were going to be hurt

56:44.401 --> 56:45.869
by somebody saying
they should go home.

56:45.969 --> 56:49.038
I did not take joy out of
answering the question.

56:49.139 --> 56:50.974
I'm not a mean or malicious
person like that.

56:51.074 --> 56:53.143
Looking back,
it did kind of suck.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.978
It seemed like I was
dogpiling on you,

56:55.078 --> 56:56.813
but that was not my intention
at all.

56:56.913 --> 56:58.281
Luxx going down the line

56:58.381 --> 57:00.150
actually felt really good
for me...

57:00.250 --> 57:02.018
[laughter]

57:02.118 --> 57:03.620
So, thanks for that, girl.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.622
You know, I answered
the way that I did,

57:05.722 --> 57:06.990
and I do apologize.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.259
I was the first person
that answered.

57:09.359 --> 57:10.960
I didn't know if anyone
was going to do

57:11.060 --> 57:12.495
"this person's
my biggest competition."

57:12.595 --> 57:14.964
I didn't know if people
were gonna do track record.

57:15.064 --> 57:18.568
If I had to have picked
one other person,

57:18.668 --> 57:21.404
it would have gone based on

57:21.504 --> 57:23.039
the challenge
that we had just done.

57:23.139 --> 57:25.408
- Ow. Who's that?
- I would have chosen Luxx.

57:25.508 --> 57:27.510
Not because you hurt
my feelings,

57:27.610 --> 57:29.946
but you're the only person
I could think of

57:30.046 --> 57:31.714
who struggled
with the choreography

57:31.815 --> 57:34.584
- in the Rusical.
- Me? I was the only person?

57:34.684 --> 57:35.985
Yeah.

57:36.085 --> 57:37.654
You were struggling
in the beginning,

57:37.754 --> 57:39.122
and Mistress was struggling.

57:39.222 --> 57:40.790
- Now why am I in it?
- And Anetra was struggling.

57:40.890 --> 57:42.425
So how was I the one

57:42.525 --> 57:43.726
who was struggling
with the choreography?

57:43.827 --> 57:44.994
Luxx, you were the only
person who,

57:45.094 --> 57:46.463
when we were filming
the actual Rusical,

57:46.563 --> 57:48.231
you messed up the choreography.

57:48.331 --> 57:50.500
I, like, turned
the wrong way or something.

57:50.600 --> 57:53.503
If it was based
on that exact challenge,

57:53.603 --> 57:55.305
that is how I would have answered.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.340
All right.
And finally,

57:57.440 --> 57:59.843
a serious question
for Mistress.

57:59.943 --> 58:01.511
Did you, indeed, get a photo

58:01.611 --> 58:03.913
at the Sasha Colby
Meet and Greet?

58:04.013 --> 58:05.782
- [laughter]
- You know,

58:05.882 --> 58:07.383
I didn't have my wrist band
on hand,

58:07.484 --> 58:09.118
but of course I snuck in.
And I was like,

58:09.219 --> 58:11.387
"Oh, my God, Sasha,
I love you so much!" Aaah!

58:11.488 --> 58:13.590
And she stole all my merch.

58:13.690 --> 58:16.159
But listen,
I did want an updated one,

58:16.259 --> 58:18.328
so, aunty, look at the camera,
let's pose.

58:18.428 --> 58:20.129
[RuPaul laughing]

58:20.230 --> 58:22.899
What did she write
on the picture, Mistress?

58:22.999 --> 58:25.134
Uh, M-I-B--
Major Intestinal Blockage.

58:25.235 --> 58:28.738
[laughter]

58:28.838 --> 58:31.774
All right, it's now time
for a segment we're calling

58:31.875 --> 58:34.777
Celebrities Are Just Like Us.

58:34.878 --> 58:37.113
They crazy.
Take a look.

58:38.481 --> 58:40.683
- This is everything...
- This little latex moment...

58:40.783 --> 58:42.151
Thank you. I feel like a--

58:42.252 --> 58:43.987
like a condom a little bit.

58:44.087 --> 58:45.955
Give walking protection.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.390
Yes!

58:47.490 --> 58:48.925
It's gonna be really hard

58:49.025 --> 58:50.360
for me to not leave here today

58:50.460 --> 58:51.995
and like follow you all.

58:52.095 --> 58:54.430
Just, I ruin the season immediately.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.698
You're the one posting
on Reddit.

58:55.798 --> 58:56.766
[laughter]

58:56.866 --> 58:58.835
I run that page.

58:58.935 --> 59:00.036
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.372
- Thank you so much.
- Is this vodka?

59:02.472 --> 59:04.707
- Okay.
- There was no way around it--

59:04.807 --> 59:06.209
I'm gonna sneeze.

59:06.309 --> 59:07.277
Aah!

59:07.377 --> 59:09.812
- Excuse me.
- Threw her back out.

59:09.913 --> 59:11.648
I have to tell you something.

59:11.748 --> 59:14.651
When I told my daughter
I was gonna be on this show,

59:14.751 --> 59:17.487
she actually started
cussing me out.

59:17.587 --> 59:19.188
"You didn't invite me?
Why didn't you--

59:19.289 --> 59:22.292
What is wrong with you?
You're a bad dad!"

59:22.392 --> 59:25.161
"Honey, I work with De Niro!"

59:25.261 --> 59:27.163
"Dad, I don't care!

59:27.263 --> 59:28.831
It's not RuPaul!"

59:28.932 --> 59:30.900
Oh, my God,
you guys are so cute.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.835
You're so pretty!

59:32.936 --> 59:35.538
You do not look basic.

59:35.638 --> 59:36.973
You sold the shit
outta that line:

59:37.073 --> 59:38.441
"You can't get pregnant twice."

59:38.541 --> 59:40.677
And I'm glad,
'cause it's a good line

59:40.777 --> 59:42.745
that I gave to you.

59:42.845 --> 59:44.247
Yes, thank you.

59:44.347 --> 59:45.782
That Netflix woulda paid
a lotta money for,

59:45.882 --> 59:47.951
but there ya go.
I love the show.

59:48.051 --> 59:50.920
I love what she wore
on the runway.

59:51.020 --> 59:53.022
It's very Celia Cruz for me.

59:53.122 --> 59:55.391
AzÃºcar!

59:55.491 --> 59:57.460
Prosthetic penises
are all the rage.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.662
- I'm gonna get one.
- I'm gonna order one from QVC.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.397
- I'll give you mine.
- That'd be the wrong color,

1:00:01.497 --> 1:00:03.633
- Michelle.
- Well... really?

1:00:03.733 --> 1:00:05.168
[RuPaul laughing]

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:07.971
- With that spray tan?
- Thank you! You know me.

1:00:08.071 --> 1:00:11.474
Don't let the smooth titties
fool ya.

1:00:11.574 --> 1:00:12.909
Their act is so cool,

1:00:13.009 --> 1:00:15.345
but they were just saying
they wanna fuck you.

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:16.946
I didn't say
that I wanted to fuck you.

1:00:17.046 --> 1:00:18.948
I just wanted to give you head.

1:00:19.048 --> 1:00:20.950
No, I'm blushing
under my mask now.

1:00:21.050 --> 1:00:22.685
[laughter]

1:00:22.785 --> 1:00:25.955
Oh, Mistress, you so crazy!

1:00:26.055 --> 1:00:28.157
- That was so inappropriate.
- Oh, my goodness.

1:00:28.257 --> 1:00:30.727
We'll be right back.
[giggling]

1:00:30.827 --> 1:00:32.829
[upbeat pop music]

1:00:32.929 --> 1:00:35.632
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

1:00:35.732 --> 1:00:38.835
Every time a drag queen
bats her false eyelashes,

1:00:38.935 --> 1:00:40.737
she's making a political statement.

1:00:40.837 --> 1:00:43.940
And it's never been
more true than right now.

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:45.975
Now, Aura, you performed
with Maren Morris.

1:00:46.075 --> 1:00:47.977
- Yep.
- Tell us about it.

1:00:48.077 --> 1:00:50.513
Yeah, I had an amazing opportunity

1:00:50.613 --> 1:00:52.081
at a benefit concert
in Nashville

1:00:52.181 --> 1:00:53.516
called Love Rising,

1:00:53.616 --> 1:00:56.219
which helped fund organizations

1:00:56.319 --> 1:01:00.123
that help fight for our rights
as LGBTQ people.

1:01:00.223 --> 1:01:02.158
And I'm very thankful
for what she has done

1:01:02.258 --> 1:01:03.626
for our community.

1:01:03.726 --> 1:01:05.461
She's using her platform

1:01:05.561 --> 1:01:06.896
to voice out her opinion,

1:01:06.996 --> 1:01:09.065
and I really appreciate that
about her.

1:01:09.165 --> 1:01:11.534
And you live in Nashville.
What's the climate there like?

1:01:11.634 --> 1:01:13.403
It's-it's scary.

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:17.240
I feel like I don't feel safe
just driving to work in drag.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:20.410
I'm worried about my safety
at my own bar.

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:23.613
It's really disheartening
and sad to see

1:01:23.713 --> 1:01:25.815
the progress that we have
made as a community

1:01:25.915 --> 1:01:27.450
just being pulled back
so easily.

1:01:27.550 --> 1:01:29.919
Robin, I understand
you hosted an event

1:01:30.019 --> 1:01:32.088
at Yale University.

1:01:32.188 --> 1:01:35.024
I was the first drag queen
to speak at Yale Law.

1:01:35.124 --> 1:01:38.761
It was a... a very important
protest for them,

1:01:38.861 --> 1:01:41.097
because a lot of the lawmakers

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:43.199
that are having laws
put against us

1:01:43.299 --> 1:01:45.935
in the queer community
have studied and graduated

1:01:46.035 --> 1:01:48.237
from Yale Law.

1:01:48.337 --> 1:01:51.374
So I stopped by.
I did a Drag Queen Story Hour

1:01:51.474 --> 1:01:54.877
where I'm reading a children's
book to grown-ass adults.

1:01:54.977 --> 1:01:58.014
But it was fully in protest

1:01:58.114 --> 1:02:02.685
to all of these heinous,
hateful laws coming into place.

1:02:02.785 --> 1:02:04.253
I love that.
I love it.

1:02:04.353 --> 1:02:06.622
Now, all you girls are touring
the country right now.

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:08.658
What is the climate out there?

1:02:08.758 --> 1:02:10.693
I actually was booked
in Nashville,

1:02:10.793 --> 1:02:12.662
and I can honestly say

1:02:12.762 --> 1:02:14.630
I was like super nervous
and scared.

1:02:14.731 --> 1:02:17.333
'Cause we know when certain
things like bills get passed,

1:02:17.433 --> 1:02:19.435
like, it causes a uproar.

1:02:19.535 --> 1:02:23.106
People have very, like, strong
opinions and strong views,

1:02:23.206 --> 1:02:25.475
and I didn't know
if they would come to the club,

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:28.277
when what we do
is out of love.

1:02:28.377 --> 1:02:30.012
But I think it's also
important to mention

1:02:30.113 --> 1:02:32.148
that a lot of these bills
are secretly--

1:02:32.248 --> 1:02:34.517
or not so secretly--
meant to target

1:02:34.617 --> 1:02:37.153
trans men and women
who aren't drag performers

1:02:37.253 --> 1:02:38.554
who just wanna live
their lives.

1:02:38.654 --> 1:02:41.090
We are not the only ones
that these bills are targeting.

1:02:41.190 --> 1:02:43.993
- Absolutely.
- Well, as a trans...

1:02:44.093 --> 1:02:46.829
drag queen, I feel like
the legislation right now

1:02:46.929 --> 1:02:50.199
is particularly zoned in
on people like me.

1:02:50.299 --> 1:02:52.935
And I feel nervous traveling.

1:02:53.035 --> 1:02:55.571
Like, what if, when I go
into the airport bathroom,

1:02:55.671 --> 1:02:58.775
and someone recognizes me
that is not a fan

1:02:58.875 --> 1:03:01.644
and wants to call the police because

1:03:01.744 --> 1:03:03.613
I'm in their bathroom?

1:03:03.713 --> 1:03:06.149
It's really the other side
showing their cards

1:03:06.249 --> 1:03:08.584
and knowing that we have
displayed so much power

1:03:08.684 --> 1:03:10.353
and unity in the past few years

1:03:10.453 --> 1:03:13.322
that they need to just throw
anything at the wall

1:03:13.422 --> 1:03:14.924
- and see what sticks.
- Right.

1:03:15.024 --> 1:03:17.160
Because we are now more
out and proud,

1:03:17.260 --> 1:03:20.096
those small minorities
are very loud,

1:03:20.196 --> 1:03:21.697
so it's just so important
for all of us,

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:23.866
no matter where we are,
to speak up

1:03:23.966 --> 1:03:26.502
and protest in whatever
little way is possible.

1:03:26.602 --> 1:03:27.837
And it means
we're doing something right

1:03:27.937 --> 1:03:29.038
if they're getting nervous.

1:03:29.138 --> 1:03:30.540
- That's true.
- Exactly.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.308
We are shining so bright
that they are so nervous

1:03:32.408 --> 1:03:33.910
that they wanna
take away everything.

1:03:34.010 --> 1:03:35.444
- Yes.
- And it doesn't matter

1:03:35.545 --> 1:03:38.815
if you're gay, drag, trans--
all of it's the same to them.

1:03:38.915 --> 1:03:41.083
You are absolutely right.
People who have

1:03:41.184 --> 1:03:43.419
been used to having an
advantage in our culture--

1:03:43.519 --> 1:03:45.588
these people are in full fear,

1:03:45.688 --> 1:03:48.124
and so they're lashing out
at us

1:03:48.224 --> 1:03:50.860
because we are having
a good ol' time

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:53.996
living our life,
and they can't stand it.

1:03:54.096 --> 1:03:57.099
But let me tell you--
nothing is more powerful

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.068
than a registered vote.

1:03:59.168 --> 1:04:00.603
Please remember that.

1:04:00.703 --> 1:04:04.307
Now, this season, we had four
queens from Connecticut,

1:04:04.407 --> 1:04:07.977
and the state government
has something to say about it.

1:04:08.077 --> 1:04:09.478
- Oh, wait, really?
- Take a look.

1:04:09.579 --> 1:04:12.415
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Governor
Susan Bysiewicz

1:04:12.515 --> 1:04:13.783
from Connecticut,

1:04:13.883 --> 1:04:15.685
and I am joined today

1:04:15.785 --> 1:04:20.256
by our small but mighty
LGBTQ+ caucus

1:04:20.356 --> 1:04:23.059
with one thing
that we'd like to say.

1:04:23.159 --> 1:04:24.560
Thank you!

1:04:24.660 --> 1:04:27.496
Amethyst, Robin, Loosey,
and Jaxx,

1:04:27.597 --> 1:04:29.999
you've made us all proud
here in Connecticut.

1:04:30.099 --> 1:04:31.968
You've shown the nation
what Connecticut has to offer.

1:04:32.068 --> 1:04:33.569
And we are working every day

1:04:33.669 --> 1:04:35.304
to protect your right
to be you.

1:04:35.404 --> 1:04:37.240
Because now, more than ever,

1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:40.276
the world needs bright lights
like each of you.

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:42.545
So thank you for
representing our state,

1:04:42.645 --> 1:04:44.881
for showcasing your charisma, uniqueness,

1:04:44.981 --> 1:04:47.683
nerve, and talent,
and for reminding everyone

1:04:47.783 --> 1:04:50.319
the freedom of expression
is a human right.

1:04:50.419 --> 1:04:53.289
And now it's time
to remind all lawmakers

1:04:53.389 --> 1:04:55.024
across the country:

1:04:55.124 --> 1:04:56.726
Love wins!

1:04:56.826 --> 1:04:58.327
[murmuring, laughter]

1:04:58.427 --> 1:05:00.396
They got every queer person
in Connecticut for that.

1:05:00.496 --> 1:05:02.231
[chatter, laughter]

1:05:02.331 --> 1:05:05.301
I love that.
That's great.

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:06.802
Queens, how does that
make you feel?

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:08.604
It's amazing.
This season was literally

1:05:08.704 --> 1:05:10.406
Connecticut versus the world.

1:05:10.506 --> 1:05:13.175
But it's amazing to be able

1:05:13.276 --> 1:05:16.479
to put Connecticut on the map
and show that we have talent.

1:05:16.579 --> 1:05:19.548
Um...[tearfully] I'm really
touched by that, actually.

1:05:19.649 --> 1:05:23.552
I feel like growing up
I didn't really feel welcome

1:05:23.653 --> 1:05:26.989
in such a small state,
and, uh...

1:05:27.089 --> 1:05:28.758
[exhales]
I'm sorry.

1:05:28.858 --> 1:05:29.992
[sniffling]

1:05:30.092 --> 1:05:32.995
I think that just shows
that we're really

1:05:33.095 --> 1:05:34.730
making a difference
in the world,

1:05:34.830 --> 1:05:36.532
and I think we forget that sometimes.

1:05:36.632 --> 1:05:38.334
And, um...
[sniffling]

1:05:38.434 --> 1:05:40.002
my favorite thing to do

1:05:40.102 --> 1:05:42.204
is to go to Pride celebrations
in Connecticut

1:05:42.305 --> 1:05:45.241
because I see so many

1:05:45.341 --> 1:05:48.945
so many kids and teenagers who...

1:05:49.045 --> 1:05:51.414
look up to us,
and when they see us,

1:05:51.514 --> 1:05:54.517
it makes them feel like

1:05:54.617 --> 1:05:57.186
their life isn't gonna
be miserable.

1:05:57.286 --> 1:05:59.188
- Yeah.
- And...

1:05:59.288 --> 1:06:01.223
the fact that anything
that I've done

1:06:01.324 --> 1:06:05.061
can make my state

1:06:05.161 --> 1:06:07.296
feel like a more
welcoming place

1:06:07.396 --> 1:06:08.764
really means
the world to me.

1:06:08.864 --> 1:06:11.000
Keep shining, ladies.

1:06:11.100 --> 1:06:13.469
Keep shining
because the kids need it,

1:06:13.569 --> 1:06:15.571
and because that is our power.

1:06:15.671 --> 1:06:19.742
Keep glowing
and keep being who you are.

1:06:19.842 --> 1:06:21.844
Now it's time for a segment
we're calling

1:06:21.944 --> 1:06:23.446
Gather Her.

1:06:23.546 --> 1:06:25.815
Ladykins, if there's anything

1:06:25.915 --> 1:06:28.284
you wanna get off
your chesticles,

1:06:28.384 --> 1:06:30.353
this is the time.

1:06:30.453 --> 1:06:31.921
Well, I have something

1:06:32.021 --> 1:06:33.656
that I'd like to get off
my chest.

1:06:33.756 --> 1:06:36.392
Wait--Irene? You?

1:06:36.492 --> 1:06:38.427
I know, it's very shocking. Um...

1:06:38.527 --> 1:06:40.663
I have heard
two separate things

1:06:40.763 --> 1:06:43.099
from two different people
in this cast.

1:06:43.199 --> 1:06:45.134
Mistress, the first thing
that you did

1:06:45.234 --> 1:06:47.436
when you got on the phone
with me after you got home

1:06:47.536 --> 1:06:49.438
was tell me that after I left

1:06:49.538 --> 1:06:53.075
Loosey LaDuca made a comment
about me, saying--

1:06:53.175 --> 1:06:55.077
'cause I was very open
about the fact

1:06:55.177 --> 1:06:57.313
that I have had filler
on the show--

1:06:57.413 --> 1:06:58.881
and you said that Loosey said,

1:06:58.981 --> 1:07:00.750
"Irene doesn't even look
like she's had filler.

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:02.551
In fact, it looks like
her face is sagging."

1:07:02.651 --> 1:07:04.487
And...

1:07:04.587 --> 1:07:06.655
I confronted Loosey about that.

1:07:06.756 --> 1:07:08.491
- What the fuck?
- And she told me

1:07:08.591 --> 1:07:10.593
that she would never
say something like that.

1:07:10.693 --> 1:07:12.828
So did you make that up,
or did Loosey really say that?

1:07:12.928 --> 1:07:14.830
I did not make
anything up, but--

1:07:14.930 --> 1:07:17.500
- So Loosey said that?
- Absolutely not.

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:19.969
I don't even remember
this conversation.

1:07:20.069 --> 1:07:21.604
I remember it vividly.
I didn't talk to you

1:07:21.704 --> 1:07:23.739
- for three months after that.
- Well...

1:07:23.839 --> 1:07:26.075
I mean, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one,

1:07:26.175 --> 1:07:28.210
and that's all I'll say.

1:07:28.310 --> 1:07:29.712
I would never say that.

1:07:29.812 --> 1:07:31.847
Well, Loosey, I don't know
if I said that.

1:07:31.947 --> 1:07:33.416
I don't know what's true,

1:07:33.516 --> 1:07:35.551
but if you only had one day
on "Drag Race,"

1:07:35.651 --> 1:07:37.553
you hold on to what
you have, so...

1:07:37.653 --> 1:07:39.588
let's move forward.

1:07:39.688 --> 1:07:41.323
I just have a question.

1:07:41.424 --> 1:07:43.125
Who the fuck has my baby?

1:07:43.225 --> 1:07:45.961
Oh, my God.
It's in my closet.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:48.297
- Oh!
- Ah!

1:07:48.397 --> 1:07:50.366
- I knew it!
- Anetra, why do you

1:07:50.466 --> 1:07:52.601
- have her baby?
- Well, she's the father.

1:07:52.701 --> 1:07:54.603
Oh! Okay.

1:07:54.703 --> 1:07:56.806
No, I had the baby
because I was gonna do

1:07:56.906 --> 1:07:58.674
Kristen Wiig
for the Snatch Game,

1:07:58.774 --> 1:08:01.210
and she does a character
where she has baby arms.

1:08:01.310 --> 1:08:03.145
And I do not have baby arms.

1:08:03.245 --> 1:08:05.815
However,
Amethyst did have a baby.

1:08:05.915 --> 1:08:07.950
What's fascinating
about this group, I will say,

1:08:08.050 --> 1:08:09.518
is that I feel like
it's corny--

1:08:09.618 --> 1:08:11.554
every season they're like,
"We're one big family."

1:08:11.654 --> 1:08:13.089
And I feel like we are
in the sense

1:08:13.189 --> 1:08:14.957
where I'm sure we have
all watched the show back,

1:08:15.057 --> 1:08:17.326
there's been moments where were
like, "Oh, that little bitch.

1:08:17.426 --> 1:08:18.994
I'm gonna get her!
She said th--"

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:21.130
But it's like when we're here
it's like

1:08:21.230 --> 1:08:23.299
we're all hot, we're all
sickening, we're all talented.

1:08:23.399 --> 1:08:24.967
It's like
brush it off the back.

1:08:25.067 --> 1:08:28.571
You know, it's so funny,
every generation of this show,

1:08:28.671 --> 1:08:30.673
there's more social media.

1:08:30.773 --> 1:08:33.175
And it seems as though
the girls come here

1:08:33.275 --> 1:08:36.745
and they are very aware
of, uh,

1:08:36.846 --> 1:08:40.549
what people might say
about them on social media.

1:08:40.649 --> 1:08:43.552
Do you feel sort of muzzled

1:08:43.652 --> 1:08:47.623
by the impression you may
give to people on social media?

1:08:47.723 --> 1:08:49.725
No, I don't, because

1:08:49.825 --> 1:08:51.026
there's going to be
somebody out there

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.294
who does not like
what you're doing,

1:08:52.394 --> 1:08:53.896
so you can't please everybody,

1:08:53.996 --> 1:08:56.265
so just do what you gotta do
to make yourself happy.

1:08:56.365 --> 1:08:58.534
Have you gotten a lot of
clap back on social media?

1:08:58.634 --> 1:09:00.402
Me? Never!

1:09:00.503 --> 1:09:02.872
Oh, no, yes, I definitely
have had my fair share

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:04.306
of hate comments.

1:09:04.406 --> 1:09:06.342
- How do you deal with it?
- I block them.

1:09:06.442 --> 1:09:07.743
I don't internalize them,

1:09:07.843 --> 1:09:09.378
because they're all coming
from people

1:09:09.478 --> 1:09:11.914
whose opinions don't make
any difference in my life.

1:09:12.014 --> 1:09:13.682
- Yeah.
- I feel like as the show

1:09:13.782 --> 1:09:15.184
continues, as well,
there's certain moments

1:09:15.284 --> 1:09:18.287
with certain people
who maybe will

1:09:18.387 --> 1:09:21.190
make the fanbase or certain
demographics of it

1:09:21.290 --> 1:09:22.791
really get ignited.

1:09:22.892 --> 1:09:25.227
For instance, like when Marcia
and I had our moment

1:09:25.327 --> 1:09:27.463
on "Untucked" where we were
deciding who was second place

1:09:27.563 --> 1:09:28.697
during Snatch Game,

1:09:28.797 --> 1:09:30.966
my Instagram account
got banned three times

1:09:31.066 --> 1:09:33.369
because all the [indistinct]
ganged up on me.

1:09:33.469 --> 1:09:34.837
In those moments,
we don't feel like

1:09:34.937 --> 1:09:36.839
we're necessarily like
truly going at it.

1:09:36.939 --> 1:09:37.973
It's just like a bump
in the road.

1:09:38.073 --> 1:09:39.909
But these people
feel so attached to us,

1:09:40.009 --> 1:09:42.945
or they have underlying racism

1:09:43.045 --> 1:09:45.247
or they're fat-phobic
or things like that.

1:09:45.347 --> 1:09:47.016
And I really feel like myself,
and Luxx especially,

1:09:47.116 --> 1:09:49.118
we constantly are like
just getting attacked

1:09:49.218 --> 1:09:51.587
for just being ourselves,
and I don't regret any of it.

1:09:51.687 --> 1:09:53.622
I'm a real drag queen.
This is what I do.

1:09:53.722 --> 1:09:55.758
This is how I handle
my relationships with people.

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:59.061
At the end of the day, I think
there's some people in the cast

1:09:59.161 --> 1:10:01.897
where, you know, they spoke out

1:10:01.997 --> 1:10:04.333
and they've really said,
hey, this is not cool.

1:10:04.433 --> 1:10:06.035
And there's some people
who just let us take,

1:10:06.135 --> 1:10:08.137
you know, the shit,
but it's no tea.

1:10:08.237 --> 1:10:11.473
Yeah, listen, I've been
doing this for over 40 years,

1:10:11.574 --> 1:10:13.409
and people say stuff
all the time.

1:10:13.509 --> 1:10:15.644
I am unbothered

1:10:15.744 --> 1:10:17.580
by what someone might say.

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.348
So, you know, I implore you

1:10:19.448 --> 1:10:22.017
to not take any of that stuff seriously,

1:10:22.117 --> 1:10:24.920
'cause the best revenge
is living well

1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:27.690
and prospering,
you know what I'm saying?

1:10:27.790 --> 1:10:29.458
I also have something
to address.

1:10:29.558 --> 1:10:30.459
What's that, Luxx?

1:10:30.559 --> 1:10:32.995
Pretty kiss, Miss America!

1:10:33.095 --> 1:10:35.931
[laughter]

1:10:36.031 --> 1:10:38.033
I didn't get it.

1:10:40.135 --> 1:10:42.238
[singing] 'Cause
you're a star, baby

1:10:42.338 --> 1:10:44.807
Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited."

1:10:44.907 --> 1:10:47.509
Now, all season long,
our top four gave us

1:10:47.610 --> 1:10:50.679
a master class
in drag excellence.

1:10:50.779 --> 1:10:54.149
Now, I wanna highlight some of
their very best moments.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:57.586
First up, Anetra blew us away

1:10:57.686 --> 1:10:59.722
with her electrifying
talent show performance.

1:10:59.822 --> 1:11:00.789
Take a look.

1:11:00.889 --> 1:11:02.825
[lip syncing] Quack quack

1:11:02.925 --> 1:11:04.627
Quack quack quack quack

1:11:04.727 --> 1:11:06.829
You better walk
that fucking duck

1:11:06.929 --> 1:11:08.530
[laughter]

1:11:08.631 --> 1:11:10.966
Walk that fucking duck

1:11:11.066 --> 1:11:12.601
It's--do you smell that?

1:11:12.701 --> 1:11:14.270
It's like something's burning.

1:11:14.370 --> 1:11:17.239
Is that... my pussy?

1:11:17.339 --> 1:11:18.274
Yes.

1:11:18.374 --> 1:11:19.341
[laughter]

1:11:19.441 --> 1:11:21.110
It is!

1:11:21.210 --> 1:11:22.678
Oh, my God, it's on fire.

1:11:22.778 --> 1:11:24.013
Does anybody have, like...

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:26.048
[laughter, cheering]

1:11:26.148 --> 1:11:28.183
Like a fire extinguisher?

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:30.152
[laughter]

1:11:30.252 --> 1:11:32.121
And stage reset.

1:11:32.221 --> 1:11:34.056
I think there's
a fire extinguisher

1:11:34.156 --> 1:11:35.658
in the back stage area.

1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:39.428
Better walk that fucking duck.

1:11:39.528 --> 1:11:41.797
Quack.
[laughter]

1:11:41.897 --> 1:11:44.767
You have kicked
the zeitgeist

1:11:44.867 --> 1:11:48.037
in the pussy
forever and ever and ever.

1:11:48.137 --> 1:11:49.405
And you're going to become

1:11:49.505 --> 1:11:51.440
a multimillionaire
with that phrase.

1:11:51.540 --> 1:11:53.442
Get your knees ready.

1:11:53.542 --> 1:11:55.978
They're gonna want it
for the rest of your life.

1:11:56.078 --> 1:11:57.479
I love it. I love it.

1:11:57.579 --> 1:11:58.547
Thank you.

1:11:59.815 --> 1:12:02.484
Oh ho, my goodness!

1:12:02.584 --> 1:12:04.720
My gosh!
Okay, so, Anetra,

1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:06.989
what advice do you have

1:12:07.089 --> 1:12:10.959
for anyone who wants to learn
how to walk that fucking duck?

1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:12.561
- Keep that ass down...
- Uh-huh.

1:12:12.661 --> 1:12:14.997
Quack, uh, really cuntily.

1:12:15.097 --> 1:12:16.532
Knees high.

1:12:16.632 --> 1:12:19.134
- And pussy on fire.
- Okay!

1:12:19.234 --> 1:12:21.303
So when did you
first start mixing

1:12:21.403 --> 1:12:24.740
your love of martial arts
with vogueing?

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.375
Oh, that was the first time, really.

1:12:26.475 --> 1:12:28.210
- What?
- That's really the first time.

1:12:28.310 --> 1:12:29.311
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1:12:29.411 --> 1:12:31.613
Oh, my gosh!

1:12:31.714 --> 1:12:33.349
So some say it's vogueing.

1:12:33.449 --> 1:12:35.184
Some say it's "nogueing."

1:12:35.284 --> 1:12:36.485
Oh, lord.

1:12:36.585 --> 1:12:37.486
What do you have to say
about that?

1:12:37.586 --> 1:12:40.089
I would say it's vogueish.

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:41.990
[laughing] Okay.

1:12:42.091 --> 1:12:46.295
And how are your "Walk
That Fucking Duck" merch sales?

1:12:46.395 --> 1:12:49.198
I have made a pretty penny--
not millions yet.

1:12:49.298 --> 1:12:50.733
But a pretty penny.
We're on our way.

1:12:50.833 --> 1:12:52.301
We're working up to it.

1:12:52.401 --> 1:12:54.036
I also know for a fact
that all her fans

1:12:54.136 --> 1:12:56.638
for the meet and greet bring
her little rubber duckies.

1:12:56.739 --> 1:13:00.042
Yes, oh my gosh,
they throw them at me on stage.

1:13:00.142 --> 1:13:02.711
All right.
Next up, Luxx Noir London

1:13:02.811 --> 1:13:04.713
wowed the world

1:13:04.813 --> 1:13:06.615
with her House of Visage couture.

1:13:06.715 --> 1:13:08.150
Take a look.

1:13:08.250 --> 1:13:10.619
Luxx Noir London,

1:13:10.719 --> 1:13:12.721
representing Africa!

1:13:12.821 --> 1:13:16.058
Can we get some water?
'Cause that zebra is panting.

1:13:16.158 --> 1:13:18.861
Tonight, the fashion girl

1:13:18.961 --> 1:13:20.329
is in the building.

1:13:20.429 --> 1:13:23.699
The flow of this top that is
made out of bed sheets

1:13:23.799 --> 1:13:26.969
and curtain rod hooks is
just giving, like, the drama.

1:13:27.069 --> 1:13:28.637
The garment is stunning.

1:13:28.737 --> 1:13:30.873
Take that,
Garden State Parkway!

1:13:30.973 --> 1:13:32.274
You could nevah!

1:13:32.374 --> 1:13:35.611
She sewed those trousers,
which were a rug,

1:13:35.711 --> 1:13:38.180
and the way she put it together
with the lines matching up

1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.349
made out of that
is virtually impossible,

1:13:40.449 --> 1:13:42.384
and she did it here.

1:13:42.484 --> 1:13:44.153
This was top tier.

1:13:44.253 --> 1:13:47.589
Just the details did not
look like amateur details.

1:13:47.689 --> 1:13:50.225
This was a master class

1:13:50.325 --> 1:13:53.862
in do it yourself
instant glamour.

1:13:53.962 --> 1:13:55.764
It was perfection.
It was perfection.

1:13:55.864 --> 1:13:59.067
Love, love, love, love.

1:13:59.168 --> 1:14:01.270
Oh, my gosh, gorgeous!
Now, Luxx,

1:14:01.370 --> 1:14:03.572
what are the three things
everyone should know

1:14:03.672 --> 1:14:05.941
about slaying the runway?

1:14:06.041 --> 1:14:08.477
Have fun, pace yourself,

1:14:08.577 --> 1:14:11.079
and try something new.

1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:13.382
Now, when did you know this
look was coming together?

1:14:13.482 --> 1:14:16.418
When I cut the pattern
for the pants

1:14:16.518 --> 1:14:18.387
and I knew that everything
lined up,

1:14:18.487 --> 1:14:20.789
I was like, oh, well,
she has it in the bag, honey.

1:14:20.889 --> 1:14:22.724
[laughter]

1:14:22.825 --> 1:14:24.026
How did it feel
on the runway?

1:14:24.126 --> 1:14:25.627
It was one of my proudest moments

1:14:25.727 --> 1:14:27.529
I think of my entire life.

1:14:27.629 --> 1:14:29.331
To be able to do that
in front of the world,

1:14:29.431 --> 1:14:32.734
in front of my idol--
it really just meant so much.

1:14:32.835 --> 1:14:35.070
It was so good.
It was so good.

1:14:35.170 --> 1:14:37.506
All right, next up, Mistress

1:14:37.606 --> 1:14:39.408
gave a blowout performance

1:14:39.508 --> 1:14:41.343
in the Daytona Wind.

1:14:41.443 --> 1:14:42.911
Take a look.

1:14:43.011 --> 1:14:46.014
Mothah... has arrived!

1:14:47.549 --> 1:14:49.551
Big Daddy was my lovah,

1:14:49.651 --> 1:14:51.787
and I loved him.

1:14:51.887 --> 1:14:53.555
And he loved me,

1:14:53.655 --> 1:14:56.692
and I loved him
right back again.

1:14:57.793 --> 1:14:59.962
Reverend, handle light
weight, darling.

1:15:00.062 --> 1:15:01.997
Oh, what--what--yes--

1:15:02.097 --> 1:15:03.932
Reverend, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

1:15:04.032 --> 1:15:08.036
Spare the rod, spoil the child,
Mama always said.

1:15:08.136 --> 1:15:11.173
Hit dogs do hollah, honey.

1:15:11.273 --> 1:15:13.442
Ooh! You got some
communion wafers?

1:15:13.542 --> 1:15:15.644
Cut! Ha ha ha!

1:15:15.744 --> 1:15:17.479
You're a motherfucking
star, bitch.

1:15:17.579 --> 1:15:18.881
Thank you.

1:15:18.981 --> 1:15:20.749
I'm fucking loving
what you're doing.

1:15:20.849 --> 1:15:23.285
Our Fancy, she was really
fun to watch.

1:15:23.385 --> 1:15:25.187
- Let me in!
- It started off with a bang,

1:15:25.287 --> 1:15:26.688
and it kept getting better.

1:15:26.788 --> 1:15:27.956
She commanded the room.

1:15:28.056 --> 1:15:31.860
It's like, I'm going to
let you bitches have it.

1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.495
Oh, my gosh.

1:15:33.595 --> 1:15:37.266
Mistress! Have you ever done
any acting before?

1:15:37.366 --> 1:15:39.935
I act a fool all the time.

1:15:40.035 --> 1:15:43.171
No, I've never done any, like,
professional acting.

1:15:43.272 --> 1:15:44.873
Oh, you made me laugh
so hard.

1:15:44.973 --> 1:15:47.743
See, I feel like I was giving
a very serious performance,

1:15:47.843 --> 1:15:50.012
looking back at it.

1:15:50.112 --> 1:15:51.647
No, I don't know, like,

1:15:51.747 --> 1:15:53.348
I think that's one of
my favorite things,

1:15:53.448 --> 1:15:55.250
especially in my drag,
just bringing joy to people.

1:15:55.350 --> 1:15:56.785
And, like, I wanna make
everyone laugh,

1:15:56.885 --> 1:15:58.253
I want everyone to have
a good time

1:15:58.353 --> 1:15:59.721
because that's what drag's
all about.

1:15:59.821 --> 1:16:01.723
Now, um, I wanna know
from the other queens

1:16:01.823 --> 1:16:04.326
what it was like acting
with Mistress.

1:16:04.426 --> 1:16:07.162
I just know that
me and Sasha were in the back

1:16:07.262 --> 1:16:10.432
cracking--like, we had to
like turn around.

1:16:10.532 --> 1:16:12.167
Okay, cut, that was--

1:16:13.535 --> 1:16:15.671
She'd say something,
we'd like bust out laughing.

1:16:15.771 --> 1:16:17.773
It was one of the highlights
of my "Drag Race" experience.

1:16:17.873 --> 1:16:18.807
She completely crushed it.

1:16:18.907 --> 1:16:20.742
What you did

1:16:20.842 --> 1:16:22.811
in that challenge, Mistress,

1:16:22.911 --> 1:16:25.447
you could go right into
a sitcom today.

1:16:25.547 --> 1:16:27.015
You know what
it would be called?

1:16:27.115 --> 1:16:28.417
"Mistress."

1:16:28.517 --> 1:16:31.486
You'd be the motherfucking
star of that show.

1:16:33.255 --> 1:16:35.490
And finally, Sasha Colby

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:37.693
posed the house down

1:16:37.793 --> 1:16:39.761
in the "Blame it on the Edit"
music video.

1:16:39.861 --> 1:16:41.496
Let's take a look.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:42.831
[lip-synching] Bad bitch body

1:16:42.931 --> 1:16:44.399
I don't come and play

1:16:44.499 --> 1:16:46.201
Best believe when I
stepped on the scene

1:16:46.301 --> 1:16:47.869
Shitty hoes just run away

1:16:47.970 --> 1:16:50.038
Dream-chaser, style-maker

1:16:50.138 --> 1:16:51.907
Game-changer, bank-maker

1:16:52.007 --> 1:16:53.542
Crack the code,
now y'all know

1:16:53.642 --> 1:16:56.044
Sasha Colby run the show, ah

1:16:56.144 --> 1:16:57.646
I love doing music videos,

1:16:57.746 --> 1:17:00.682
so thank God it's literally
what I've been

1:17:00.782 --> 1:17:02.818
trained to do, and I love it.

1:17:04.186 --> 1:17:06.221
This is pop star boot camp, baby.

1:17:06.321 --> 1:17:08.590
It's a lot to make it
look like it's not a lot,

1:17:08.690 --> 1:17:10.592
you know, to make it look effortless.

1:17:10.692 --> 1:17:15.030
I'm really glad I got to have
my video vixen dream

1:17:15.130 --> 1:17:16.031
come true.

1:17:16.131 --> 1:17:17.766
Yay!

1:17:17.866 --> 1:17:18.900
You said, you know what,

1:17:19.001 --> 1:17:20.235
I'm gonna show you

1:17:20.335 --> 1:17:22.571
what it's like
[laughs] to be

1:17:22.671 --> 1:17:24.573
a motherfucking video star.

1:17:24.673 --> 1:17:26.241
[laughter]

1:17:26.341 --> 1:17:28.443
The steps?
Sure, I got 'em.

1:17:28.543 --> 1:17:30.812
I'm not only gonna do
the steps,

1:17:30.912 --> 1:17:33.582
I'm gonna add a little
extra uh-uh.

1:17:33.682 --> 1:17:36.318
Flicking the hair in sync
with the arm thing--

1:17:36.418 --> 1:17:38.020
it's like, okay, I got it.

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.688
I'm amazed by you.

1:17:39.788 --> 1:17:41.390
I'm the motherfucking
queen of drag.

1:17:41.490 --> 1:17:42.958
I'm amazed by you.

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:46.928
Wow, so amazing.

1:17:47.029 --> 1:17:49.965
This video is outrageous.

1:17:50.065 --> 1:17:52.534
Now, Sasha, what can you
tell our viewers

1:17:52.634 --> 1:17:53.835
about connecting
with the camera?

1:17:53.935 --> 1:17:56.004
Because, bitch, you connected.

1:17:56.104 --> 1:17:59.608
Uh, I...I don't know.
I love the camera, I do.

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:02.544
I just see, like,
who I wanna seduce

1:18:02.644 --> 1:18:06.248
and cast a spell on,
and just lock eyes.

1:18:06.348 --> 1:18:08.116
I learned that, actually,
from Monica Munro.

1:18:08.216 --> 1:18:09.484
She just had this commitment

1:18:09.584 --> 1:18:10.886
where she locked eyes
on a person

1:18:10.986 --> 1:18:13.989
and she made you almost
like feel uncomfortable.

1:18:14.089 --> 1:18:16.491
And I enjoy that.

1:18:16.591 --> 1:18:18.260
No, I've seen Monica Monroe perform,

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:20.629
and you're absolutely right.
One of the greats.

1:18:20.729 --> 1:18:23.465
Now, have you been
in music videos before?

1:18:23.565 --> 1:18:25.367
I haven't before,
but I've had the privilege

1:18:25.467 --> 1:18:27.703
of choreographing for many
"Drag Race" alumni

1:18:27.803 --> 1:18:29.204
and their music videos.

1:18:29.304 --> 1:18:32.374
I see. You know, listen,
you have a dance background.

1:18:32.474 --> 1:18:35.677
You know how to make
complicated movements

1:18:35.777 --> 1:18:37.446
look effortless,
and that's what you did in it.

1:18:37.546 --> 1:18:39.815
Are you surprised
by what you saw?

1:18:39.915 --> 1:18:41.416
Uh...

1:18:41.516 --> 1:18:42.951
No.

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:45.987
I am very happy
with how it turned out.

1:18:46.088 --> 1:18:47.856
Gorgeous.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

1:18:47.956 --> 1:18:51.126
It really is a master class. Absolutely.

1:18:51.226 --> 1:18:53.395
Now, next week
at the grand finale,

1:18:53.495 --> 1:18:55.464
the competition continues

1:18:55.564 --> 1:18:58.967
as our queens perform
show-stopping solo numbers.

1:18:59.067 --> 1:19:01.536
And in the end, two queens

1:19:01.636 --> 1:19:03.472
will go head to head
and toe to toe

1:19:03.572 --> 1:19:06.108
in a lip sync for the crown.

1:19:06.208 --> 1:19:08.710
The winner will receive
a one-year supply

1:19:08.810 --> 1:19:10.846
of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics

1:19:10.946 --> 1:19:15.150
and a cash prize
of $200,000,

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:17.119
served by Cash App.

1:19:17.219 --> 1:19:19.221
Fans, who do you think
should be

1:19:19.321 --> 1:19:22.390
America's next drag superstar?

1:19:22.491 --> 1:19:24.025
Are you Team Anetra,

1:19:24.126 --> 1:19:26.328
Team Luxx Noir London,

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:28.230
Team Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

1:19:28.330 --> 1:19:30.665
or Team Sasha Colby?

1:19:30.766 --> 1:19:33.068
Let your voice be heard
using #dragrace

1:19:33.168 --> 1:19:34.936
and tune in next week

1:19:35.036 --> 1:19:36.938
for the grand finale
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

1:19:37.038 --> 1:19:39.474
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:19:39.574 --> 1:19:41.443
how the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:19:41.543 --> 1:19:42.978
Can I get a amen up in here?

1:19:43.078 --> 1:19:44.546
Amen!

1:19:44.646 --> 1:19:46.982
All right, y'all,
let the music play.

1:19:47.082 --> 1:19:48.950
[singing]
A little bit of love

1:19:49.050 --> 1:19:51.019
Goes a long, long way

1:19:51.119 --> 1:19:54.322
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:19:54.422 --> 1:19:56.391
Can you feel the love?

1:20:07.335 --> 1:20:09.604
A little bit of love

1:20:09.704 --> 1:20:12.140
Goes a long, long way

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:14.910
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:20:15.010 --> 1:20:17.279
A little bit of love

1:20:17.379 --> 1:20:19.781
Goes a long, long way

1:20:19.881 --> 1:20:22.450
Turn it around
when you up and say

1:20:22.551 --> 1:20:25.587
Everybody say love, love

1:20:25.687 --> 1:20:28.056
Love oh oh oh oh

1:20:28.156 --> 1:20:31.660
Oh oh, love, oh oh

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:35.297
Love, can you feel
the love?
