We're the ones who were late.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.175
- I take it the inspector's
here because of the earthquake.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.177
- Yes, but as I explained
to her, it wasn't caused by us.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.658
- Well, the last quake
in Kansas was over 40 years ago

10:15.702 --> 10:17.834
and nowhere near
the same magnitude.

10:17.878 --> 10:21.098
- That's right, and I know
mining is the leading cause

10:21.142 --> 10:23.057
of seismic activity
in the heartland,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.189
but we haven't gone deep enough
to cause something like that.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.495
- Well, that's true, Doctor.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.801
However, the readings indicate

10:27.844 --> 10:29.541
that the epicenter
started here.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.978
And it's not
just the one quake.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.327
There have been
multiple tremors.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.850

All I can say
is we're trying to get

10:35.547 --> 10:38.507
to the bottom of it, literally.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.423
- Can you explain why Amertek
hired an expert in mineralogy

10:41.466 --> 10:43.164
as its chief of operations?

10:43.207 --> 10:44.644
- I have several degrees,

10:44.687 --> 10:46.689
but I'm mainly here
as a geologist,

10:46.733 --> 10:48.735
which is quite normal
in mining.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.651
- But you came to Amertek
for this job specifically?

10:51.694 --> 10:55.480
- Yes, that's right.
- Because of the X-Kryptonite?

10:55.524 --> 10:58.614
- Most people aren't aware of
exactly what we're extracting,

10:58.658 --> 11:01.748
but it's no secret that Amertek
was hired to clear these mines,

11:01.791 --> 11:04.620

why that is.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.230

what Morgan Edge

11:06.274 --> 11:07.928

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
- It could be really dangerous
in the wrong hands.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.107
Amertek is doing
a public service.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.545
But whether these mines
are full of X-Kryptonite or not

11:16.588 --> 11:19.417

activity we're experiencing.
