WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.037
- Deal.
- All right.

00:03.137 --> 00:04.038
Flip it.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.207
Heads.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.941
Ha! Give me my 20.
- Oh.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.009
That is a 20.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.644
- You pay me the 20
you just lost.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.413
- That is a 20.
I gave you 20 first to hold.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.415
- You can't do that.
- Don't be trying to cheat.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.816
- All right. I tried.
- Don't be trying to cheat.

00:15.916 --> 00:16.850
- I tried.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.722
male narrator: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:21.822 --> 00:24.092
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:24.192 --> 00:25.593
narrator:
The treasures within...

00:25.693 --> 00:27.595
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.929
narrator:
Are put up for auction.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.264
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:30.364 --> 00:31.965
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:32.066 --> 00:33.501
- You shut your face.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.669
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.837
- We're back, baby!

00:39.973 --> 00:43.010
- So today we're
in Stanton, California.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.113
Somewhere new
I haven't been before.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.315
I notice signs
for Knott's Berry Farm

00:47.415 --> 00:48.849
and for Disneyland.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.419
I want today's auction
to be like an amusement park.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.786
People spending lots of money,

00:52.886 --> 00:54.422
everybody having fun,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.090
and hopefully nobody throws up.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.926
So crossing my fingers
it's gonna be an awesome day.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.131
- Well, every time
I go somewhere

01:03.231 --> 01:04.132
I been getting ran up.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.799
But hey, today, my goal is

01:05.899 --> 01:07.135
to not let them run me up,

01:07.235 --> 01:10.070
so I'ma try to get
a sneaky unit for dirt cheap.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.939
Ivy's gonna be
sneaking and creeping,

01:12.039 --> 01:15.243
and bidding on the down-low
low-key.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.211
Maybe I should practice
my sneaky bid.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.846
A wink here.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.448
A nose here.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.650
Slight head nod there.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.452
*

01:24.552 --> 01:25.486
Crazy look there.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.789
- So today was supposed to be
my day off.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.659
And I was gonna put
everything on marysfinds.com.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.727
- * Marysfinds.com

01:34.895 --> 01:36.397
But Emily texted me

01:36.497 --> 01:38.532
and said that she's
running an auction.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.368
So I figured, what the heck?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.870
I can snag up
some more trinkets!

01:44.572 --> 01:46.407
- The competition's
really fierce.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.942
You got all the cuckoo Kennys
and the crazy Marys

01:49.042 --> 01:50.611
and they're buying
all the small stuff

01:50.711 --> 01:52.513
and making it
really difficult for me

01:52.613 --> 01:54.014
to get in there
and buy these things.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.617
I used to be a big fish
in a small lake.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.386
But now the lake
is getting bigger.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.087
You can see what I mean.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.622
I've got the experience.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.257
I know what I'm looking for.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.594
And I'm still keeping the...
goldfish alive.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.928
If you can feed your goldfish,

02:08.028 --> 02:09.663
you're doing well
in this business.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.166
- You look cute!

02:12.266 --> 02:13.401
- You do too.
- Look at all you guys.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.402
Did you call ahead and say,

02:14.502 --> 02:15.736
"We're all gonna
wear black today"?

02:15.836 --> 02:18.806
- Yeah.
- Uhh--maybe, huh.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.641
Damn it.
- I'm only half black.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.909
- No, you look full black
to me.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.377
- Okay.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.313
I'm gonna just let that one go.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.147
- Good afternoon, everybody!

02:27.248 --> 02:29.450
Thank you for coming out today
to Stanton's Self Storage.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.419
My name is Emily.
I'm gonna be your auctioneer.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.254
Once we get to the unit,
I'm gonna open the door.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.122
You guys can all look,
but you can't touch

02:35.223 --> 02:36.590
or go inside the unit.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.025
This is a cash-only auction.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.093
If you have cash in your
pocket, you can buy today.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.862
If you guys are ready, so am I.
Let's go!

02:41.962 --> 02:43.897
- Whoo!

02:45.366 --> 02:46.800
10x15!

02:46.900 --> 02:48.101
*

02:48.202 --> 02:49.770
Oh-ho, yeah.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.071
Watch out for falling objects.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.408
*

02:54.508 --> 02:56.143
- Some old TVs, electronics,

02:56.244 --> 02:57.878
and a jukebox I like.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.547
I'm in for the right price.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.350
- That's actually a CD jukebox.

03:02.450 --> 03:05.419
Oh, look at that old
Marshall Half Stack amplifier.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.120
Whoo.
That's worth some money.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.790
All right.
- Come on, Mar'.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.492
- Hey.
- Take a peek.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.960
*

03:13.060 --> 03:16.096
- There's a lot of bigger items
than I would like,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.299
'cause I'm looking for
little trinkets

03:18.399 --> 03:21.201
and stuff that I can sell quick
on marysfinds.com.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.271
- * Marysfinds.com

03:24.472 --> 03:26.006
- Got a jukebox here,
CD jukebox.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.641
Those are actually worth
a little bit of money there.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.976
I kind of like it.
I don't love it.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.177
But I'm gonna bid a little bit.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.481
Hey, I'ma bid on the down-low.
Down-low.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.682
- What do you want
to start it at?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.183
- Uh, 300.
300, oh.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.418
*

03:37.518 --> 03:38.919
Alrighty, guys, here we go!

03:39.019 --> 03:40.288
What do you say there?
And I've got 300.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.755
And how about 350?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.156
Make it 350?

03:43.257 --> 03:44.792
325?
Now 350.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.261
375.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.331
And 400.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.401
425.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.468
450.
Now I got 475

03:54.568 --> 03:56.069
Want to beat, 475?
- Yup!

03:59.172 --> 04:00.541
- Yup!

04:00.641 --> 04:02.242
550?

04:02.343 --> 04:03.544
Make it 575?
- Yup!

04:03.644 --> 04:04.878
600?

04:04.978 --> 04:07.748
650.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.483
675?
- No!

04:09.583 --> 04:12.052
675?

04:12.152 --> 04:15.656
Sold it to you, $650.
Ivy got it for 650.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.791
- Kept my bid sneaky.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.494
And got a $1,000 locker
for 650.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.397
Solid, sellable stuff.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.534
- Here we go, guys!

04:29.637 --> 04:31.372
*

04:31.472 --> 04:33.641
- Oh, my God, a coffin.
Are you kidding me?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.476
- Oh, that is creepy!

04:35.576 --> 04:36.944
- Spooky.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.446
- Toolbox is interesting.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.113
Looks like there might be
a big old welder.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.215
Looks like it was a brake shop
or something.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.283
*

04:43.384 --> 04:45.285
They got
a compressor back there.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.987
I'm gonna bid;
I'm not gonna bid much,

04:47.087 --> 04:48.055
'cause that's
some big stuff in there,

04:48.155 --> 04:50.491
but--ah--I am gonna bid.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.694
- Got some nice rolling carts
and stuff in there too.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.195
And big-ass compressor.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.964
All right, man.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.699
- There are three
vintage trunks in here.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.267
Those are pretty freakin' cool.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.470
But there's like gas propane
thingies in here,

05:02.570 --> 05:04.204
so I can't do anything
with that stuff.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.673
- All right, what
do you say there, 300?

05:05.773 --> 05:07.808
Got 300.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.076
Now 350?

05:09.176 --> 05:11.278
- Yup!
400?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.480
400. Now 450?
- Yup!

05:14.047 --> 05:15.082
- Yup!

05:15.182 --> 05:16.283
- And 550.
Make it 600?

05:16.384 --> 05:17.284
Make it 650?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.719
- Yup!

05:18.819 --> 05:19.953
700. Make it 800?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.422
- Yup.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.424
- 800. Now 900.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.359
- Yup.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.595
- No chance, Darrell.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.196
- Yup!

05:29.296 --> 05:30.831
- I love spending his money.

05:30.931 --> 05:31.932
1,300.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.401
- Yup!
- Now 1,400.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.205
Sold it to you, 1,400!
And Dave got it for $1,400!

05:38.305 --> 05:39.773
- I feel like your ex-wife...
- There you go.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.109
- Still spending your money.
- Nothing changes, Darrell.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.478
Darrell is kind of
like my ex-wife.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.447
In the end,
I screwed 'em both.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.115
- Let's go this way, guys!

05:48.215 --> 05:49.517
- Going straight for the money.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.051
Snap-On Toolbox.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.720
And it looks a little like
it's been beat up a little bit,

05:52.820 --> 05:55.122
but it's still worth
about 1,500 bucks.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.391
And that's my money
for the empty toolbox.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.526
*

05:58.626 --> 06:00.828
And...he didn't

06:00.928 --> 06:02.930
have all the Snap-On tools
in here,

06:03.030 --> 06:04.798
but he's got some tools
in here.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.201
Probably got $1,500 in the box,
$500 in tools.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.138
And then Mama's trunks.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.106
That one's empty.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.575
*

06:18.679 --> 06:20.113
I guess this is
the Halloween trunks.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.982
50 bucks for that pile.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.016
I thought it was empty.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.618
Oh, .
That one's heavy.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.656
Huh.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.424
*

06:30.524 --> 06:32.626
Some kind of old foot pedals.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.127
*

06:34.227 --> 06:36.029
Look at this.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.099
Cool, little pedals, and...

06:39.199 --> 06:40.601
some kind of motor.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.236
"The Ritter Dental
Manufacturing Company.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.372
Automatic air compressor unit."

06:45.473 --> 06:47.441
You know what's funny is

06:47.541 --> 06:49.510
dental air compressors,

06:49.610 --> 06:52.913
uh, today, the modern ones
are super expensive.

06:53.013 --> 06:56.416
And, uh, this may be
the first version of that.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.985
I don't know
what the pedals do.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.587
I gotta get this stuff
to the dentist.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.421
Hopefully the only filling
I'm gonna get

07:01.522 --> 07:03.857
is in my wallet,
with money.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.160
This--this is a wheel balancer
is what this is.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.529
You put the wheel on there,

07:08.629 --> 07:09.997
and you've got all your
little weights and stuff

07:10.097 --> 07:11.264
in here in these trays.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.000
I'm gonna say easy 1,000 bucks.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
And then this is an
AC recharger, 500 bucks.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.540
Got about a $400
air compressor.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.308
This here is for tuning brakes.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.843
Those machines, I know,
the new ones

07:22.943 --> 07:24.211
are 5,000, 10,000.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.614
I'm gonna say that's
another 1,000 bucks easy.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.850
Paper cutter.
40 bucks on the paper cutter.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.351
And then we have
this coffin here.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453
I'm gonna say 40 bucks.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.056
Oh, this kind of looks like
my buddy Darrell.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.691
Hey, Darrell, I more than
doubled my money.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.026
What do you think about that?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.428
Hey, want to flip for it?
Heads or tails?

07:41.529 --> 07:43.130
*

07:43.230 --> 07:46.066
Heads!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
- Here we go!

07:50.103 --> 07:53.974
*

07:54.074 --> 07:55.843
- There's a lot
of boxes in here,

07:55.943 --> 07:58.245
but there's no big furniture
or anything like that.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.848
I don't see anything
that really sticks out.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.350
- There are lots of
stacked boxes.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.918
That's a good sign for me,
'cause there could be

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
trinkets galore in there,

08:07.120 --> 08:08.355
and that's what
I'm looking for.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.558
So I'm gonna take a gamble.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.660
You flip it; I'll call it.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.494
- 20, I thought it was 20.
- Heads.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.231
Yeah!
Pay up.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.499
- Guys!
- We're coming.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.235
- This is an auction,
not a casino.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.938
- I don't know why
Emily's flipping out.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.607
I'm just being the gambler.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.543
Oh, that's kind of a cool,
little truck right there.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.944
Everything was
taken well care of.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.012
I like this room.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.513
- You got a chair.
You got a vacuum.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.884
Just kind of looks like
swap meet, garage sale stuff.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.151
But it's kind of clean.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.953
It's not dirty.
It doesn't stink.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.955
For the right price,
I might be in.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.591
250?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.993
Got 250.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.328
- Yup!

08:48.428 --> 08:49.763
Now 325?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.998
350?
You're both out.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.166
- Yup!
- Dave.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.102
400?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.637
Now 400.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.505
- Yup!

09:00.173 --> 09:02.876
Make it 475?

09:02.976 --> 09:05.512
- Yup!
- Dave, oh, my God.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.181
I'm beginning to see why
people don't like you, Dave.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.550
500 now.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.622
525?

09:14.722 --> 09:15.623
- No!

09:16.957 --> 09:18.592
Make it 550?
Come on back in.

09:18.692 --> 09:22.495
550.
Make it 575?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.231
Sold it to Mary, $550.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.199
- Good buy, Mary.
Good buy, good eye.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.268
- Alrighty, you guys, that's
gonna do it, the last unit!

09:28.368 --> 09:29.803
Thank you for coming out today!

09:29.903 --> 09:32.105
Make sure you see me in the
office and pay before you load!

09:32.205 --> 09:33.807
See you next time!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.108
- You know, I'm kind of pumped,
because I think

09:35.208 --> 09:37.244
that this one
is full of treasures!

09:37.344 --> 09:39.312
*

09:39.412 --> 09:40.914
- I didn't get anything today.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.315
- No!

09:42.415 --> 09:43.851
- Enough of
this fishy business.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.552
I'm taking my rod
and going home.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.087
Look at that walk.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.356
- That's the walk of victory.
- That's Stubby right there.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.258
- Walk of victory!
- You go, Stubby.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.893
- Go home, loser.
- Dick.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.031
- Got a good unit for 650.
That was the plan.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.432
Hey, being sneaky paid off.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.034
How much?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.670
Gotta wait and see.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.104
Got a compressor here.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.438
Looks to be in good shape.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.707
100 bucks.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.077
Right here,
this is a CD jukebox.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.611
Pretty expensive.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.346
This thing I'll put at
about 600 bucks.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.215
I got a Receiver there,
Receiver here.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.884
Receiver sell the best
out of everything.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.652
50 for this one.
50 for this one.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.487
And 20 for that one.
That's about 120 bucks there.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.656
This TV, I don't even
got to turn it.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.758
Whether it works or not,
no money.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.559
Right here, what looks like
a beer refrigerator.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.560
Probably drop your beers
in there

10:27.661 --> 10:28.762
and hand 'em to customers.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.898
100 bucks.
This is my money.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.165
Looks like a floor machine.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.266
Look at that, it's even

10:33.366 --> 10:34.601
buffing the wood
right there it's so good.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.503
200 bucks, easily.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.539
So this right here,
got wheels, got the top.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.374
Throw some ice in there,
some cool drinks.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.910
100 bucks.
Wow.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.245
One, two, three, four rims.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.814
These look like 18-inches.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.149
Really cool.
I'll get 300 bucks for those.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.218
Ladders sell really good
in my store.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.986
Easy, 30 bucks.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.923
I had to reach over here.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.758
This pool table light
hangs over your pool table

10:57.858 --> 10:59.292
like this so you can
play at nighttime.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.362
Being that it's got
Miller Lite on it, 75.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.697
*

11:03.797 --> 11:05.632
I've never got
one of these in a unit.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.868
But let me tell you something.

11:07.968 --> 11:08.869
I'll put this
in my living room,

11:08.969 --> 11:11.004
watch TV like a boss.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.239
100 bucks, right here.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.274
Now, this right here is...
open sesame.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.910
Ooh.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.478
ht here
is not gonna be cheap.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.113
Anytime you see
a lot of levers,

11:20.213 --> 11:21.348
it means more money to me.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.718
Well, with all this,
the mixer, the amps,

11:24.818 --> 11:27.587
the recording system,
all the electrical setups,

11:27.687 --> 11:28.956
this dude is worth 450.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.325
Right here we got a harmonica,

11:32.425 --> 11:34.762
daddy, mommy, and baby.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.065
* Ooh

11:38.165 --> 11:41.769
This might be the--
well, this is definitely...

11:41.869 --> 11:43.336
I need four lips for that dude.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.505
And I only got two.

11:45.605 --> 11:46.639
Hell, you might need eight.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.475
This has got to be a harmonica.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.311
Yep.
Wow.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.713
And this has got to be one.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.149
This is more for
1 1/2 lips there.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.651
Now this is the granddaddy
of them all.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.990
Lookee here.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.691
I have no idea
what these dudes are worth.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.259
These dudes are really weird.
Look at that.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.799
Damn.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.434
I'm not gonna lie, I know
very little about harmonicas.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.204
I'ma put 'em together and get
'em all looked at at one time,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.206
'cause maybe I hit
the mother lode

12:19.306 --> 12:21.641
or maybe I just
found a unit that blows.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.178
*

12:25.278 --> 12:26.814
- All right.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.481
I bought this locker for 550.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.451
And I'm hoping that it's full
of treasures and trinkets,

12:31.551 --> 12:33.020
for marysfinds.com.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.955
- * Marysfinds.com

12:36.056 --> 12:37.825
Okay, let's get started.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.459
*

12:39.559 --> 12:42.295
Uh, junk.
Just office stuff.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.031
Nothing.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.132
*

12:45.232 --> 12:48.001
Oh, yeah.
Collectibles.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.903
"Star Wars" ones.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.238
And they're in the box.

12:51.338 --> 12:55.008
These are just money.
50 bucks.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.812
Oh, Discover DJ,
computer DJ system.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.914
Yes!

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
DJ Mary P!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.217
Poppin' the hits.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.986
Oh, my gosh, this thing's rad.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.858
I probably could, you know,
bust out some awesome

13:10.958 --> 13:12.725
tunes and sounds
with this voice.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.362
I'm gonna say
20 bucks for this thing.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.430
"Legend of the Field."

13:17.530 --> 13:20.400
"Limited edition collectible.
Individually numbered."

13:20.500 --> 13:22.102
No idea who this man is, but

13:22.202 --> 13:24.471
it's all in the packaging
and it's NFL.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.006
It can maybe get 50 bucks.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.176
What else is in here?
Ooh, tags on.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.511
Jersey.
Guerrero.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.513
Nice, the price tag's
right there.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.482
193.
Jackpot.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.584
I'm gonna say, you know,
100 bucks for this.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.320
Some DVDs, at 2 bucks a pop.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.089
So that's about 100 bucks
right there.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.892
Ooh, some old home décor stuff.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.659
Some frames.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.261
There's some pottery in here.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.362
So this stuff is cool.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.764
This box,
I'm gonna say 50 bucks.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.902
That's so cute.
It's a little, um, fire truck.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.071
This thing is craftsmanship,
well-made galore.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.506
I'm gonna say 140 bucks.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.741
These things are--
oh, my gosh.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.245
I mean, this is like the--
all the fad right now, okay?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.381
So this thing is money.
150 bucks, easily.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.884
Oh, my gosh, look at
all these baseball cards.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.320
Money!

14:13.420 --> 14:15.088
This box is probably worth
200 bucks.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.390
Guess I didn't strike out
on this locker!

14:17.490 --> 14:19.292
Touchdown, Mary!

14:19.392 --> 14:20.360
*

14:20.460 --> 14:22.162
Oh, my gosh.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.364
A grenade.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.466
Um, it looks maybe
like it's real,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.668
because it has a marking,
a stamp on here.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.770
"Fuze M228."

14:30.870 --> 14:33.406
This is cool.
It's a little collectible.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.308
Put this on your little
coffee table, if you'd like.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.311
This thing is bomb.com.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.247
Probably sell for 20 bucks.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.248
What else we got in here?

14:43.283 --> 14:45.518
Awesome, it's a parking meter!

14:45.618 --> 14:46.987
You know, I think
I'm just gonna

14:47.087 --> 14:48.956
pop this outside my apartment,

14:49.056 --> 14:51.724
and I'll never have to worry
about parking again!

14:56.296 --> 14:57.564
I'm bringing my dental stuff

14:57.664 --> 14:59.599
to Lawrence and Sally's
at Studio Antiques.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.168
Hopefully they make me smile.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.370
Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Hey, Mister Hester.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.404
How are you, man?
- Good to see you.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.106
- I got some heavy metal
here, man.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.408
- A little bit.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.943
- I'm more of a disco man.
- If it's valuable.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.645
- Well, this is the stuff
I talked to you about.

15:15.015 --> 15:15.949
- Sounds like it's fine.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.651
- Excuse me.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.753
- It does sound an awful lot
like you, honey.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.655
- It says "Dental Manufacturing
Company.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.126
Automatic air compressor unit.
1916-17."

15:26.226 --> 15:28.161
Bloody, it's pretty old then.
- Pretty old.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.729
- I've heard of
the Ritter Company.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.698
They were the guru
of dental chairs.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.934
And from thereon, they
got into these things.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.270
- Uh, it's a compressor.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.538
So I don't think
it's electrical.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.008
It would run off air
and water and stuff like that.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.909
- This would run the--
the hand tools.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.044
When they're sticking
their hand in your mouth.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.745
Both: Yeah, yeah.
- You've had that happen.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.147
- And they say,
"Open wide, Dave."

15:50.483 --> 15:51.484
ghter]

15:51.584 --> 15:53.120
- Be careful, honey.
He might bite.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.988
Yeah.
Wouldn't want to get rabies.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.457
- There you go, exactly.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.559
I think maybe these two
took a few rips of laughing gas

15:59.659 --> 16:00.960
before I got here.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.096
- So anyway, let's move on
to the next one.

16:03.196 --> 16:07.000
This is made by S, S. White.
Samuel White is the guy's name.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.435
- Obviously a foot went here.
- Yeah.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.936
And this should make it
so you--

16:10.037 --> 16:11.704
It's like a treadle sewing
machine, you know?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.606
- Okay, yeah.
- Same principle.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.508
And then there was a pole
went up here.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.509
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.609 --> 16:17.544
- And then they would have

16:17.644 --> 16:19.646
all the pulleys
and that kind of stuff

16:19.746 --> 16:20.980
up there with the drill
at the end.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.582
- And that's how
they drilled into your mouth?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.551
- Yeah.
This one, unfortunately, Dave,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
has a little broken arm
at the top.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.254
- Broken arm at the top.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.988
- And you got a missing leg
here.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.624
So, you know, it's footloose
and fancy-free, this one.

16:31.724 --> 16:32.792
- Let me get this one
out of the way.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.927
- Focus on this, uh...

16:35.028 --> 16:36.629
- Yeah, the pristine one.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.166
It still has a little bit of
the foot pedal rubber on here.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.767
You know?
- Yeah, it's good ole leather.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.102
Lasts about 100 years.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.204
- It's kind of a art nouveau
with the sprayed legs

16:44.304 --> 16:45.405
and all this stuff, you know?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
- Well, you know,
talking about price

16:47.607 --> 16:49.008
and what it could be worth,

16:49.109 --> 16:51.311
you know, this all
could be yours...

16:51.411 --> 16:52.712
- Oh.
- For the right price.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.947
- The problem is that
all three pieces--

16:55.048 --> 16:57.684
one's broken,
and this one is incomplete.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.986
So this is our price for you.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.323
I say 125!
- 150.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.991
- 150.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.559
Well, it's better than
getting my teeth pulled.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.361
I don't know, maybe next time
I go to my dentist,

17:08.461 --> 17:10.430
I'll bring this in and see
if I can barter for some more.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.199
- There you go, man.
Yeah, it'd probably work.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.566
- Yeah.
Half a cleaning.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.368
- He'll give you some free
sample toothpaste or something.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.836
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.040
- My old "ultimate fighting"
agent

17:21.141 --> 17:22.775
knows some people
in the music business.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.044
So he set me up with the
lead singer of Blues Traveler,

17:25.145 --> 17:26.113
John Popper.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.980
*

17:28.081 --> 17:30.750
I heard he knows a thing or two
about harmonicas.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.352
Hey, John, how you doing?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.354
- Hey, Ivy.
Good to meet you.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.822
Sit on down.
- Hey, John.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.490
Ooh, glad you're able
to make time with me today.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.991
- Happy to, man. Happy to.
- Good to see you.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.994
Well, right here.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.663
Check this dude out.
- Ah, the paddle wheel.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.931
- I've never even
seen one before.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.299
You call it "paddle wheel"?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.368
- Well, 'cause it's got like
a paddle wheel kind of design.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.736
- Oh, kind of like
a casino boat?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.738
- Yeah, exactly.
So the low notes are here.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.378
*

17:58.478 --> 17:59.946
So it's--basically
the way that works is

18:00.046 --> 18:03.015
you have different keys set up
so that they're easy to get at.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.751
So you're playing in this key,
and then you go here

18:04.851 --> 18:07.587
and they all relate and you can
play a bunch of songs that way.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.457
This one here,
I'd say 1902-ish.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.858
- Is this the United States
kind of thing or?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.760
- Oh, no, this is Germany.
It's the Hohner Company.

18:13.860 --> 18:14.927
They're still making them?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.796
- Oh, they're still making--
the kind I play.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.531
- Now, what makes
a harmonica work?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.099
I know you gotta
blow into it, but...

18:20.200 --> 18:21.734
- Well, there's two things.
I always say it's like life.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.102
Sometimes you blow;
sometimes you suck.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.405
- So, uh, you exhale

18:25.505 --> 18:28.107
and you're blowing over
some reeds.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.376
They just vibrate.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.710
- Uh, "reeds."
- Reeds.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.912
- Yeah, not weeds.
That's for after the show.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.315
- But the reeds
vibrate when you blow.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.384
And then there's another
set of reeds on the bottom

18:37.484 --> 18:39.352
that vibrate when you inhale.
- Okay.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.354
- So you get a...

18:41.454 --> 18:43.055
And you inhale, get a...

18:43.156 --> 18:45.358
- Oh, I didn't know you
make noise when

18:45.458 --> 18:46.626
you go in and when you go out.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.094
- That's the cool thing
is that if you do it right,

18:48.195 --> 18:49.862
you don't run out of air,
you can keep breathing.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.198
- Ah, okay.
I got another one here.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.332
- Okay, let's see what we got.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.766
Wow, that thing is...

18:53.866 --> 18:55.468
- Now, this one just--
like, it weighs a ton.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.604
- This is clearly some kind of
a bass har--

18:57.704 --> 18:59.472
oh, it's the Hohner chromonica.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.408
Now, this is a very weird
harmonica,

19:01.508 --> 19:02.675
because you only exhale.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.511
And there's very few
of these that are like this.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.779
But it's built to play
such low notes, it's like...

19:10.250 --> 19:11.751
It's like a harmonica tuba.
- Wow.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.119
- I have no idea
who played this,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.255
so God only knows what disease
I just got by playing this.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.923
Maybe Typhoid Mary
was playing this.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.157
- Uh, I dumped it
in a bottle of bleach.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.759
Oh, there you go.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.328
- Well, I brought this thing.
I don't know why.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.863
It was just sitting there.
Obviously it's a toy, junk.

19:23.963 --> 19:24.864
But I brought it anyway.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.165
- This thing's just an
advertisement

19:26.266 --> 19:27.567
Hohner puts in the window.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.935
And you hang it up like that.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.137
And they know
you've got harmonicas for sale.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.605
And this is like from the '70s.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.741
Any collector would want this.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.108
- Yeah, this thing's cool.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.545
- Now, this and every other
thing you looked at...

19:38.645 --> 19:40.146
- Uh-huh.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.183
*

19:44.284 --> 19:45.952
- I'm gonna say $800.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.688
- Whoo!
Hey, that's music to my ears.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.956
Thank you, John.
- Thank you.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.090
- I know you got
some hard work to do tonight.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.191
- Yes, this was fun though.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.493
- Is playing harmonica
hard work?

19:53.593 --> 19:56.229
- Like I said, sometimes you
blow; sometimes you suck.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.298
narrator: Dave Hester
drilled his way

19:58.398 --> 20:01.200
to a filling $3,800.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.903
Ivy Calvin didn't
get the runaround

20:04.003 --> 20:07.274
and made a harmonious
2,300 bucks.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.342
Mary Padian found
some trinkets

20:09.442 --> 20:12.945
for * marysfinds.com

20:13.045 --> 20:14.514
narrator: While
Darrell Sheets realized

20:14.614 --> 20:16.148
that his little pond

20:16.249 --> 20:19.051
just keeps getting bigger.

20:22.154 --> 20:29.161
*

20:42.642 --> 20:43.976
- Whoo!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.778
Well, I'm just happy 'cause
mine is bigger than yours.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.946
- Uh, well, you know.
