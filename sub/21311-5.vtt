the best thing we can do

he had some kind of evidence.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.817
That's okay.
It's cool.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.118
Keep leaving your prints
all over my shit;

11:58.151 --> 12:00.821
it'll make it way easier
for me to ID you.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.222
- Special Agent Nadine Memphis.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.158
I'm a friend of
Bob Lee Swagger's.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.061
And you're Kurt Zehnder,
former member of the 8113.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.262
- Not former.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.832
8113 is for life.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.802
- Is that why you've been
pretending to be dead?

12:14.835 --> 12:17.537
- It's the only way
to get stuff done.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.106
And if you're really
a friend of Swagger's,

12:19.139 --> 12:21.374
he'll know exactly
what I'm talking about.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.076
- How long you been in here?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.846
- [soft scoff]
That bottle you broke over me?

12:25.879 --> 12:28.548
Wasn't water,
let's just say that.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.983
- [exhales]

12:30.017 --> 12:32.019
Safe to say
we could both use a shower.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.287
Which I can get you, by the way.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.824
A hot shower, proper meal,
protection.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.225
- In exchange for what?

12:38.258 --> 12:42.095
- Whatever you were supposed to
send to Jeffrey Denning.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.864
- No.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.067
No, you gotta prove to me
we're on the same team.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.039
[phone beeps]

12:52.840 --> 12:56.376
[line trilling]

12:56.409 --> 12:58.946
- Bob Lee.
It's me.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.113
Remember I said I'd call you...
- Yeah.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.082
- If I found
anything interesting?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.888
- If this is really you,

13:07.921 --> 13:10.223
tell me who the greatest
band in the world is.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.225
[exhales]

13:12.259 --> 13:14.061
Holy shit.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.328
It is you.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.898
8113 for life.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.301
Oo-rah.
- Oo-rah.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.336
This is crazy.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.038
- What, good news?

13:25.072 --> 13:26.907
- You guys are
never gonna believe this.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.943
Zehnder is alive.
- What?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.245
- Apparently
he faked his suicide.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.014
- [laughs]

13:34.047 --> 13:35.348
That paranoid son of a bitch.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.050
- Yeah, man,
he's with Memphis right now.

13:37.084 --> 13:41.054
They're gonna meet us
back at the ranch tonight.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.956
- Okay, so what's the play?

13:42.990 --> 13:45.092
- We go inside and see
what the old man knows.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.626
They've moved in here
'cause he's dying,

13:46.659 --> 13:48.195
so he's got no reason to lie.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.864
- He's got no reason
to tell us anything either.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.633
- You got a better idea?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.236
Wait here.
I'll talk to the guard.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.212
- You know what I do
in real life now, Johnson?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.447
I throw bags at LAX.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.382
Sometimes we gotta search 'em.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.051
[soft scoff]

14:11.084 --> 14:12.452
And you'd be amazed
at the dark shit

14:12.485 --> 14:14.922
people hide in their luggage.

14:14.955 --> 14:15.989
- Is that right?

14:16.023 --> 14:19.126
[soft dramatic music]

14:19.159 --> 14:22.329
*

14:22.362 --> 14:25.498
- Swagger's my boy.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.335
I know what you did
to him last year.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.403
8113's supposed to be brothers,

14:30.437 --> 14:34.241
and you went and screwed him.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.109
You pull any shit
like that again this time,

14:36.143 --> 14:38.245
you and me are gonna be
going round and round.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.048
- [soft scoff]

14:41.081 --> 14:43.283
Thanks for the donut, brother.

14:43.316 --> 14:47.387
*

14:47.420 --> 14:49.122
- So?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.960
You can explain
any time you want.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.929
- Oh, I see why
Swagger's friends with you.

14:55.963 --> 15:00.000
He wasn't much for
small talk either.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.469
They killed the courier
I sent Denning.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.271
That's why I went dark.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.974
Not exactly sure
how they got onto me,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.341
but it's the only explanation.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.376
- Who's they?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.347
- If Denning's talking to you,

15:14.381 --> 15:15.448
who else is he talking to?

15:15.482 --> 15:17.150
- He's not.
He's laying low.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.019
- Tell him to stay that way.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.721
- Who is "they," Zehnder?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.157
- No.
No, we gotta move.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.026
We gotta move;
if you were able to find me,

15:26.059 --> 15:29.929
it's only a matter of time
before they can.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.399
MAN: Let them in.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.272
[faint music]

15:39.306 --> 15:40.740
- Is that music?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.475
[indistinct chatter]

15:42.509 --> 15:45.478
[Russian hip-hop music playing]

15:45.512 --> 15:53.053
*

15:56.756 --> 15:59.026
- [chuckles]

15:59.059 --> 16:02.095
[chuckling]

16:08.501 --> 16:10.070
- Alexi.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.040
- Bob Lee Swagger,

16:13.073 --> 16:15.075
as I live and breathe.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.576
Last time I saw you,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.545
there were two dead guys
in my cell.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.780
One with a missing thumb.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.316
- That's right.
Um.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.253
They said that you only have
a couple of months to live.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.487
- Come now.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.256
It's just a little poison
that they should have

16:29.289 --> 16:31.224
put in my vodka,
not in my tea.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.026
I would have taken a bigger sip.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.594
[soft chuckle]

16:34.627 --> 16:38.365
They'll never kill me.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.534
I see you brought friends.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.803
- Yeah, we have a problem.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.405
- [mumbles]

16:45.438 --> 16:52.445
*

16:58.151 --> 16:59.286
- You seen it before?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.320
- Of course, um,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.522
but we can't
speak about it here.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.126
- Where can we speak about it?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.427
- There's someone
you should meet.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.564
He'll have all the answers
to your needs.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.533
Let me grab a coat.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.535
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.370
Would you like to partake?

17:17.404 --> 17:20.207
- I'm good.
- Maybe we can come back later?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.575
Later or...
Nah.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.377
- Oh, very well.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.412
I'll meet you out front.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.148
[speaks Russian]

17:31.151 --> 17:33.286
[soft talking in Russian]

- Oh!

17:34.521 --> 17:38.491
[speaks Russian]

17:38.525 --> 17:41.194
- Old man.

17:41.228 --> 17:45.365
It's a little after
your bedtime, no?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.668
I don't know your friends.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.571
[speaks Russian]

17:52.339 --> 17:55.208
- Oh, allow me to introduce

17:55.242 --> 17:58.545
the great Bob Lee Swagger,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
hero of Russia.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.150
- Ah, yes.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.352
The shooter who missed.
[clicks tongue]

18:05.385 --> 18:06.319
Drink?

18:06.353 --> 18:08.621
- Uh, no, we just need to--

18:08.655 --> 18:10.190
- Uh, Peter,

18:10.223 --> 18:11.591
how is your father?

18:11.624 --> 18:14.294
It's been so long
since I have seen him here,

18:14.327 --> 18:16.896
in his rightful place.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.432
- If you came to kiss the ring,

18:19.466 --> 18:21.268
I'm wearing it now.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.536
- Why, it's so important
for a father

18:23.570 --> 18:27.607
to have something
to pass on to his son.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.242
Club doing well?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.344
- Very.
- Mm.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.313
And the internet business?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.748
[ominous dramatic music]

18:35.782 --> 18:38.551
- The hell you know about that?

18:38.585 --> 18:42.555
- Used to be we had lines,

18:42.589 --> 18:46.559
places we wouldn't go to,
even for money.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.462
*

18:49.496 --> 18:52.632

and your friends to leave.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.668

18:55.702 --> 19:00.407

Do you know who I am?

I said, do you know who I am?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.671
[brooding music]

19:31.704 --> 19:33.273
There was a robbery.

19:33.306 --> 19:37.244
While you two
were in the bathroom.

19:37.277 --> 19:41.514
You saw no one.
Understood?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.417
Well, now,
get the hell out of here.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.553
Both of you.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.711
- You mind telling me
what the hell that was?

20:11.744 --> 20:14.581
- Peter Petravich is the son

20:14.614 --> 20:17.784
of Ivan Petravich, a capo.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.819
- Untouchable.
- Apparently not.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.589
- Yeah, he was a piece of shit.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.925
Peter found
a new line of income,

20:25.958 --> 20:29.496
one even his father
didn't know about.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.266
Child pornography.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.969
Such people
must be disposed of.

20:37.003 --> 20:41.941
- I don't disagree,
but why involve us in this shit?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.010
- Oh...

20:44.043 --> 20:46.913
[laughs]

20:46.946 --> 20:48.615
Huh.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.950
I couldn't bring my own men.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.952
As your friend said, uh,

20:52.985 --> 20:54.954
he was untouchable.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.557
And I needed backup.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.560
- He used us.

And something in it
for you too.

to be government issued.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.355
Who's paying your freight?

21:28.388 --> 21:29.789
- Okay, at what point

21:29.822 --> 21:31.558
are you going to
tell me where we're going?

21:31.591 --> 21:32.925
- You're not hearing me.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.562
Okay, I've been saying
they're all in bed together.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.931
All of them: the FBI, CIA,
all the cartels,

21:38.965 --> 21:40.667
NATO, the Senate.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.902
People think that the
deep state is running things.

21:42.935 --> 21:46.072
Please.
It's Atlas all the way.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.908
They're so black ops,
they're--they're no ops.

21:48.941 --> 21:52.078
They're invisible ops.
- Atlas?

21:52.111 --> 21:53.813
- Don't even say their name.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.682
- Look, specifics
build a case, Zehnder,

21:55.715 --> 21:57.684
not conspiracies.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.387
I mean, what exactly
does your evidence prove?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.655
- Look for the overlap.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.957
Okay, watch who's
washing all their digits.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.793
Spokes lead to a cog, right?

22:06.826 --> 22:09.829
Like--like,
there's a banker in Mexico.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.432
Straight-up dude.
Went to Wharton.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.701
He's running all the books
for the cartels

22:14.734 --> 22:15.835
and for Atlas.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.738
That does not
happen by accident.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.773
- Okay, you got
a name for this banker?

22:20.807 --> 22:22.942
- I know he exists, okay?

22:24.777 --> 22:26.145
Turn here.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.814
- Here?
- Yes.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.849
- We've already passed this.
- Turn.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.419
- Okay, that's it.
I'm calling Bob Lee.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.687
Maybe he can get a straight
answer out of you because

22:34.721 --> 22:37.056
I've tried to--
what the--

22:48.134 --> 22:49.969
The courier only had a copy.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.171
Now I will take you
to the original.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.707
- [scoffs]

22:57.477 --> 22:59.879
- That's a rifle,
I'm sure of it.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.782
- It hasn't moved in two days.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.751
- I don't need to be sure.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.953
Light it up.
Match coordinates.

23:06.986 --> 23:10.056
- Thank you.
Here we go.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.060
[missile fires]

23:14.093 --> 23:17.096
[explosion booms]

23:24.070 --> 23:26.473
All right, now what?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.107
- Now we wait.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.777
[soft ominous music]

23:30.810 --> 23:37.950
*

23:41.854 --> 23:43.690
- Russians have been
running heroin

23:43.723 --> 23:47.927
out of Afghanistan
long before the CIA did.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.463
- Thanks for the history lesson,
but why is Solotov

23:50.497 --> 23:52.164
trying to kill us
because of this?

23:52.198 --> 23:53.700
- [soft laugh]

23:53.733 --> 23:55.134
- You've heard of him.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.470
- He was a Chechen sniper,

23:57.504 --> 23:59.238
very deadly.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.941
The Prizrak.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.042
He was a legend.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.812
Almost as famous as you.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.047
- Where do we find him?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.248
- [chuckles] No idea.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.518
And I don't want to know.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.085
After the war, he disappeared.

24:13.119 --> 24:17.189
Went to work for
some dark organization.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.258
Assassinations.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.960
Killers that leave no clues

24:20.993 --> 24:24.196
or make their murders
seem like accidents.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.534
Some call them Atlas.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.802
But they believe in
no contracts.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.237
No name, no address,

24:31.270 --> 24:33.773
no phone number, no country,

24:33.806 --> 24:34.974
and no face.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.275
- No face?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.144
What does that mean?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.980
- It means no one knows

24:41.013 --> 24:43.850
what the members look like.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.853
Secrecy is their first priority.

24:46.886 --> 24:47.987
[dramatic music pounds]

24:48.020 --> 24:49.188
- Donny.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.990
*

24:51.023 --> 24:51.991
[gunshot]

24:53.092 --> 24:56.262
- He took Solotov's ID
and wrote that damn report.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.764
I told him to burn it.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.566
- Zehnder kept it.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.767
I saw him take it.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.901
- Goddamn Zehnder.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.136
He could never let anything go.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.005
[soft ominous music]

25:06.038 --> 25:08.908
You guys, this isn't
about the heroin.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.544
It's about Solotov's identity.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.880
He's killing anybody
who's seen his face.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.247
Man, it'd always bother me

25:15.281 --> 25:17.116
why this great sniper

25:17.149 --> 25:19.886
would be so sloppy to let
his name be heard on the radio.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.020
He was trying to
make it look like

25:21.053 --> 25:22.555
a sniper versus sniper thing

25:22.589 --> 25:23.923
to cover up the fact that
it was Donny

25:23.956 --> 25:25.992
who was the target that day,
not me.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.328
- So why are we the targets now?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.030
- That reporter, Denning,

25:31.063 --> 25:33.065
the one that Nadine's
working with,

25:33.099 --> 25:34.233
he had the story.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.935
He had Zehnder.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.138
- And Zehnder had
the damn report.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.875
[phone beeps]

25:42.909 --> 25:44.343
- You've reached Nadine Memphis.
Leave a message.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.146
- Nadine's not picking up.

25:47.179 --> 25:50.049
- Hey, how do we find
this organization?

25:50.082 --> 25:53.853
- Secrecy is very expensive,

25:53.886 --> 25:56.188
and they have a lot of secrets.

25:56.222 --> 26:00.226
You want to find them?
Find their money.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.033
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.168
- You got my lane open?
- Sure do.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.937
- Wonderful.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.072
- How's Bob Lee doing
these days?

26:13.105 --> 26:15.241
He, uh, decided to
hang up his iron?

26:15.274 --> 26:17.376
- No, you kidding me?
Him? Never.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.045
He's just been
busy at the ranch.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.246
But I'll tell him
you said hi, okay?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.682
- Appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.984
[guns firing]

26:33.159 --> 26:34.293
[gun fires]

26:34.326 --> 26:37.163
- Nice grouping, sweetheart.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.397
- Thanks.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.099
- Now, how'd a girl
as pretty as you

26:40.132 --> 26:42.301
end up shooting a piece
as badass as that?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.270
- Well, my father-in-law
gave it to my husband

26:44.303 --> 26:46.005
'cause he's a shooter.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.974
Sniper, actually,
so you might want to watch out.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.308
He's probably
set up on you right now.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.377
- [chuckles]

26:51.410 --> 26:53.245
You're a live one, ain't you?

26:53.279 --> 26:55.982
You mind if
I see how she handles?

26:56.015 --> 26:58.718
- Yeah, actually.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.187
I'm gonna get back to it,
all right?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.892
- Don't have to be
a bitch about it.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.894
- Excuse me?

27:07.927 --> 27:09.128
- You heard me.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.130
[soft ominous music]

27:11.163 --> 27:12.699
- Hey.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.400
- This don't
concern you, brother.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.402
- Oh, I ain't your brother.

27:16.435 --> 27:23.409
*

27:23.442 --> 27:26.078
- [scoffs]
Aw, forget you two.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.756
- Thanks for the backup.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.290
- Of course.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.760
Seemed like you were
standin' your ground just fine.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.094
- [soft laugh]
- I'm Travis.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.462
- Um...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.264
- It's all right.
- That's just a force of habit.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.465
- I'm Julie.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.134
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.736
- My daughter slammed my arm
in a car door and

27:49.769 --> 27:51.170
she feels horrible, so

27:51.203 --> 27:53.372
I'm learning
everything left-handed.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.007
- [soft laugh]

27:55.041 --> 27:56.308
- But I don't seem to be
making much progress

27:56.342 --> 27:57.977
in the way of shooting though,
that's for sure.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.111
- Yeah, you're gonna have to do

27:59.145 --> 28:00.479
much better than that, Travis.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.081
This is Texas.
- This is true.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.050
- It's nice to meet you.
- You as well.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.417
[gun clicking]

28:11.057 --> 28:11.690
.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.425
- Set us off, Dobber.

28:14.326 --> 28:14.360
- What kind of sandwich
do you like?

28:14.794 --> 28:15.862
She said club.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.430
[Marillion playing
over headphones]

28:18.464 --> 28:20.132

28:20.166 --> 28:21.133
Z.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.969
*

28:23.002 --> 28:24.103
- Huh?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.137
- Turn that shit down, man.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.505
You're gonna go deaf.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.507
- Which wouldn't be so bad,
considering.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.843
- It's Marillion, man.
They're phenomenal.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.946
It's a mental vacation
from you bastards.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.148
- I can't believe
progressive music is your shit.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.817
It doesn't make any sense.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.418
- You want progressive?
Try Debussy.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.153
Or Beethoven.
Expand your minds.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.989
- Come on, guys.
Music is music.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.156
I like it, Zehnder.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.491
It's melodic.

28:45.524 --> 28:46.859
*

28:46.893 --> 28:48.160
- Still no movement on the hill.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.261
We're gonna wait another day.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.998
Check in tomorrow.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.266
- I think I'd rather
take my chances against Solotov

28:54.300 --> 28:56.068
than sit here
and listen to that.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.436
- Copy that.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.238
- Solotov is dead.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.942
*

29:02.975 --> 29:05.878
- West Virginia, but
work has me on the road so much

29:05.912 --> 29:08.514
I feel more like a hobo
than a husband and a father.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.883
- Oh, I understand that.
My husband's gone a lot too.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.084
Thanks, Gary.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.452
- He don't sell
farm equipment too, does he?

29:13.485 --> 29:14.954
- No, uh, he's a marine.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.089
- That's why
you're such a good shot.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.157
- Thanks.
[soft laugh]

29:18.190 --> 29:19.792
- Is he deployed?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.260
- No, he's retired.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.895
But he's still really involved.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.563
He, uh, works with other vets.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.799
Probably more than he should.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.901
- Sounds like a stand-up guy.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.069
- He is.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.504
[soft ominous music]

29:32.538 --> 29:34.573
- You know,
my wife has this saying,

29:34.606 --> 29:38.577
that the key is communication,
but the lock is trust.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.579
*

29:40.612 --> 29:42.248
I know that she can't cook
worth a damn neither.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.851
You know?
- [laughs]

29:44.884 --> 29:47.586
You know, I--
I shouldn't complain.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.056
Bob Lee's a--
a really great guy

29:50.089 --> 29:51.924
and a wonderful husband.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.292
- You know, I don't think
it's complaining

29:53.325 --> 29:54.861
to say you miss your husband.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.129
He'd probably be
happy to hear it.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.197
- Yeah.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.932
You're right.
Thanks.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.600
It was great talking with you.
- You as well.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.170
Hey, sorry to trouble you,
but any chance you could

30:04.203 --> 30:06.572
recommend a good church
to go to around here?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.941
You know, I love to shoot,
but, uh,

30:08.975 --> 30:10.342
I need the good side too.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.244
- Yeah, yeah, we go--
we go to St. Francis.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.612
It's just right up the road.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.147
And they're actually
having a, uh,

30:15.181 --> 30:16.182
a food drive this weekend,

30:16.215 --> 30:17.249
if you want to stop by.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.018
They make a big deal of it.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.519
- Well, I wouldn't want
to intrude or anything.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.088
- Come on, don't be silly.
It's a church.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.190
Anyone's welcome.
- That's very nice of you.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.624
- I mean, I can't promise that

30:25.657 --> 30:27.159
the conversation
will be riveting, all right?

30:27.193 --> 30:28.995
But we can steer it away
from tractor sales.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.863
- [laughs] That's--
that's a deal.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.364
Would you, uh,
would you mind

30:32.398 --> 30:33.966
emailing me
the name and address?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.534
I--I won't
remember it otherwise.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.604
- Sure, yeah.
Uh, let me...

30:38.637 --> 30:40.172
- I--I really
look forward to it.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.141
- Yeah.
What's your email?

30:43.375 --> 30:45.144
- How much beef

30:45.177 --> 30:48.080
do you actually think
is in this patty?

30:48.114 --> 30:50.549
I mean, the sign
says quarter pound, but

30:50.582 --> 30:52.618
I'm calling bullshit on that.

30:52.651 --> 30:53.652
- I swear we passed
that honky-tonk

30:53.685 --> 30:55.187
like six times already.

30:55.221 --> 30:59.391
- A worthwhile mission
takes patience, Nadine.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.895
Turn left.

31:05.031 --> 31:08.567
I got a question for you,
G-woman.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.236
If I'm the crazy one,

31:10.269 --> 31:13.272
what were you doing
in a dead guy's storage unit?

31:13.305 --> 31:15.674
- Following my instincts.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.245
- Your boss encourage you
to go after your gut?

31:19.278 --> 31:22.148
- She doesn't know I'm here.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.984
She'll come around
once I put it all together.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.685
- Put it all together, huh?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.587
And I'm the conspiracy nut
in the car.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.123
Next you're gonna tell me
that Oswald acted alone.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.325
- Please,
everyone knows the kill shot

31:33.359 --> 31:35.027
came from the Dal-Tex Building.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.329
- Ha! We are cut from
the same cloth, you and I,

31:37.363 --> 31:39.098
whether you like it or not.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.602
[soft ominous music]

31:43.635 --> 31:46.138
Should have asked you
to get me a milkshake too.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.307
But you--you never know
which places use

31:48.340 --> 31:50.142
actual chocolate ice cream

31:50.176 --> 31:53.412
and which place cheats and uses
that vanilla and bullshit--

31:53.445 --> 31:54.413
- We've got company.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.284

31:58.317 --> 32:00.152
God damn it.
I told you, Nadine.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.687
They are everywhere.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.094
- Hey you.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.166
- Someone's having a good day.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.367
- Yeah.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.169
Well, you just made it better.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.138
How was Seattle?

32:19.171 --> 32:21.373
- Clarifying.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.075
Have you seen Nadine?

32:23.109 --> 32:25.644
She's not answering her phone.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.446
- No, I haven't seen her
since this morning.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.482
But I see, uh, our other guests.
- Yeah.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.084
I--I'm sorry.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.752
- No. You know what?
It's all right.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.654
Mary wanted lasagna,
and I made a huge batch of it.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.723
So why don't you
invite 'em in for dinner?

32:37.756 --> 32:40.092
- Isaac too?

32:40.126 --> 32:42.161
- Jesus can break bread
with a tax collector.

32:42.194 --> 32:46.065
- I think this
is a little bit different.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.768
- It's fine.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.103
- What's gotten into you?

32:51.137 --> 32:54.073
[soft ominous music]

32:54.106 --> 32:56.508
- You know, I was having
a hard time after Frankfurt,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.777
and, uh, you know,
you being gone

32:58.810 --> 33:00.512
doesn't really
make it any easier,

33:00.546 --> 33:02.781
but today was a good day.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.517
*

33:05.551 --> 33:08.687
I want us to talk more, okay?

33:08.720 --> 33:11.490
You know, and just be honest.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.692
The key is communication.

33:13.725 --> 33:14.793
The lock is trust.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.428
*

33:16.462 --> 33:18.264
- I like that.
- Yeah.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.699
- And I'm sure those guys
would like some lasagna.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.768
- Invite 'em in.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.037
- Yo, fellas!
Come on in.

33:25.071 --> 33:28.507
[phone ringing]

33:28.540 --> 33:31.143
Yeah?
- Swagger, it's me.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.345
- Memphis, I've been
trying you for hours.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.748
- Yeah, well, your buddy threw
my cell phone out the window.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.251
Turns out we picked up a tail.
- Shit.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.154
- I don't want to lead them to
you or to Zehnder's evidence, so

33:42.188 --> 33:43.722
now that it's dark,
I'm gonna try and shake 'em.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.424
- No, don't.
Don't lose 'em.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.160
Get yourself a burner phone,
but keep driving towards me.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.528
I'll call you
in an hour and a half

33:49.561 --> 33:51.197
with specific instructions.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.464
- Yeah, okay.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.433
[brooding music]

33:54.466 --> 33:55.834
- She's gonna lead 'em here.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.469
It's an old oil refinery.

33:57.503 --> 33:58.737
- You sure no one will be there?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.372
- It's been abandoned for years.

34:00.406 --> 34:03.309
Kids use it to party, but
nobody's gonna be there at dawn.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.444
- I see a lot of egress.
- Doesn't matter.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.246
She's gonna lead 'em to us.

34:07.279 --> 34:10.116
Once they cross the fence line,
we can box them in.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.417
- And if Solotov shows?

34:11.450 --> 34:13.585
- Then we put him down,
once and for all.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.487
- What if he's got help?

34:15.521 --> 34:17.323
- Then we stitch 'em up too.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.126
- He's right.
They chose their side.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.828
- You are gonna
have to convince Memphis.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.163
- No, we won't.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.764
Once we get 'em in a gunfight,

34:25.797 --> 34:27.866
she'll leave with Zehnder,
get the docs.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.203
We'll clean up one thing
while she handles the other.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.205
- What if Solotov's not there?

34:33.239 --> 34:36.108
- Then we do what we gotta do
and make his guys talk.

34:36.142 --> 34:39.111
[suspenseful music broods]

34:39.145 --> 34:40.879
- She's going to lead you

34:40.912 --> 34:42.181
to a refinery.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.515
And I'll meet you on the--

34:43.549 --> 34:45.351
the road in to supply you.

34:45.384 --> 34:49.488
And call our friends.
We're going to need some help.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.873
- She got company?

35:10.942 --> 35:14.913
- Yep.
One car about 200 yards back.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.448
They're running dark.

35:16.482 --> 35:20.252
- Just one?

35:20.286 --> 35:21.520
- So far.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.422
- Too easy.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.528
- Oh, this is not good.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.263
- Swagger knows what he's doing.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.199
- Yeah, Bob Lee's good,
but these guys are better.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.466
Bob Lee's retired, man.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.601
For these guys, it's every day.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.836
- Zehnder, I need you to relax.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.541

Here he comes.

- Shit.

- Los Fantasmos.

38:36.682 --> 38:39.017
- Solotov could have
seen an ambush coming,

38:39.050 --> 38:40.452
but why send these guys?

38:40.486 --> 38:41.787
- Zehnder said the cartels
were in bed with

38:41.820 --> 38:44.756
a shadowy organization
called Atlas.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.124
Said they even shared a banker,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.460
some fancy Wharton guy
down in Mexico.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.728
- Atlas.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.464
That's the group Alexi said
Solotov works for.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.099
- Yeah, but it still
doesn't make sense.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.568
If Solotov knew
all his targets were here,

38:56.602 --> 38:58.036
why send the JV?

38:58.069 --> 39:00.739
[ominous music]

39:00.772 --> 39:03.675

a higher value target in mind.

never stop running.

Zehnder?

to come back here.

Very clever.

You were the best of them.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.952
Do not beat yourself up
too bad, Swagger.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.522
You can only be
in so many places at once.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.156
- I could say
the same thing about you.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.892
Killed a bunch of
your guys this morning

40:26.925 --> 40:28.827
when you left them out to dry.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.097
willing to die
for the right price.

looking for now, huh?

40:34.232 --> 40:35.867
Your face, right?

40:35.901 --> 40:37.736
- Anonymity is not
a choice for me.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.238
It is a requirement.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.973
Too bad you involved
yourself, Swagger.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.842
This could have been the end.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.077
But that is the curse
of the hero, is it not?

40:46.111 --> 40:47.846
He usually ends up

40:47.879 --> 40:49.848
standing on the bodies
of his dead friends.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.983
- Pick a place, asshole.
We can end it.

40:52.017 --> 40:54.252
- The place is everywhere.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.155
And the time is now.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.825
This ends when everyone
who knows me is gone.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.860
- That's a lot of loose ends
to tie up.

41:01.893 --> 41:05.263
- I'm not tying up
loose ends, Swagger.
