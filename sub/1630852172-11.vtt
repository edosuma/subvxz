09:09.465 --> 09:11.133
It's going crazy.
It's running in loops.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.136
I mean, it almost got hit by,
like, 20 Ubers.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.597
-So, naturally, I intervened.
-Oh, naturally.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.516
I can show you the pictures
if you don't believe me.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.017
I just-- Well,
I gotta find my phone.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.602
That won't be necessary,
Miss Barnes.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.061
Please find your seat.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.105
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

09:26.482 --> 09:26.565
(WHISPERS) Shan.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.486
Oh, I'm-- I'm okay, thanks.

09:30.569 --> 09:31.404
It's CBD. Or THC.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.156
I take the label off,
and then I forget,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.534
and then it's kinda like
the fun of not knowing,

09:36.617 --> 09:38.828
but, oh, yeah,
I know who you are.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.163
The newest member
of the Calloway Cartel.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.082
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Man, you and your sister.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.709
Talk about generational trauma.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.003
Makes me happy
I'm an only child.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.088
Wait, so what happened
with the dog?

09:49.588 --> 09:49.672
What dog?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.931
How long are you in here for?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.182
I'm in here all the time.
(CHUCKLES)

10:00.266 --> 10:01.809
I mean, my parents wanna send me
to boarding school in the fall.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.644
You?

10:03.728 --> 10:07.356
I actually don't know.
Um... I lost my scholarship,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.525
so I can't afford
to pay tuition.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.444
And you like going
to school here?

10:11.527 --> 10:15.239
I mean, I like the teachers.
And I'm learning a lot, but...

10:15.323 --> 10:17.074
doesn't feel like
it's meant to be.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.161
It just seems hopeless.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.038
That is so fucked up.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.373
Miss Barnes, need I remind you
this is a study hall

10:24.457 --> 10:26.917
and not a Tamron Hall interview?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.587
Are you profiling me,
Mr. Spencer?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.047
-What? No.
-SHAN: Because right now,

10:31.130 --> 10:33.716
this doesn't
feel like a safe space.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.301
(CLEARS THROAT)
In fact, I'm starting to feel

10:35.384 --> 10:36.552
a little lightheaded.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.721
Although that maybe
because I'm hypoglycemic

10:38.804 --> 10:41.265
and not because of your
unchecked racial bias?

10:42.641 --> 10:45.353
Oh, I could have a full-on
syncopic episode right here

10:45.436 --> 10:46.562
under your watch,

10:46.645 --> 10:47.646
unless I eat
something immediately.

10:49.690 --> 10:49.774
(GROANS)

10:53.402 --> 10:54.862
You're a life-saver, Spencey.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.290
-KATE KELLER: Mmm.
-JORDAN GLASSBERG: Hey.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.084
What did you do
to Scott this morning?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.418
He's been put on leave

11:09.502 --> 11:11.295
until the allegations against
him are vetted.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.756
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

11:13.839 --> 11:18.094
But since he won't dare open GG
while he's being investigated,

11:18.177 --> 11:19.637
we can talk without him.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.306
Look, I know we don't
always see eye to eye

11:22.390 --> 11:23.682
on the right way to do things,

11:23.766 --> 11:27.103
but I think we can all agree
that this experiment

11:27.186 --> 11:28.854
shouldn't have been hijacked
by some man

11:28.938 --> 11:32.608
just because he thinks he can
do it better than a woman can.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.734
Or Jordan.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.111
Thanks for including me.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.781
Are you seriously trying to pull
the girl power card right now?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.616
We could do this together.
The way it was intended

11:40.699 --> 11:43.702
before all this went sideways.
Equal partners.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.621
You think that we're some
wilting flowers

11:45.704 --> 11:47.790
who bent to Scott's will,
but you're wrong.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.751
We let Scott write
because he was good at it.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.627
He may be down because of you,

11:51.710 --> 11:54.880
but me and Sharon,
this is still ours.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.465
Yes. All the things she said.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.468
I'm leaving.
And not just because

11:59.552 --> 12:02.221
your Karen pixie snowflake
power grab isn't working,

12:02.930 --> 12:03.848
but also because...

12:04.890 --> 12:06.684
you get very cold very
easily at my age.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.897
Spotted, shipwreck
on the corner of Madison Ave.

12:11.981 --> 12:12.648
Or something.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.942
-(STAMMERS)
-I'll work on it.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.486
That went well. Now what?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.698
Stop being polite
and start getting real?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.450
Cut off their heads.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.952
This chaotic neutral, it's...

12:25.578 --> 12:27.163
too Demi Lovato for me.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.789
I miss lawful evil.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.710
Well, how about a little
wartime alliance?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.964
-Psst.
-What?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.008
There's-- there's an EpiPen
in the interior pocket.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.594
Just jab it into my upper thigh
and press until it clicks.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.846
All right, here we go. (GROANS)

12:43.929 --> 12:46.140
-ZOYA LOTT: Shan?
-(MUMBLING) Nut-- nuts-- nuts.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.267
-Shan, are you okay?
-Allergic-- allergies. (CHOKING)

12:48.809 --> 12:52.605
(GASPING, CHOKING)

12:52.688 --> 12:53.731
Shit! Shit, shit, shit. She's
going into anaphylactic shock.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.358
Someone call the nurse.
See if she has an EpiPen.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.693
EpiPen. Oh!
She has one in her bag,

12:57.776 --> 13:00.154
I'll get it. Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.491
-(EPIPEN CLICKS)
-(GASPS)

13:05.242 --> 13:07.244
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Thanks, babe. You're a badass.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.873
(EXHALES SHARPLY, PANTING)

13:12.124 --> 13:15.794
Next time, before you give
food to a student,

13:15.878 --> 13:19.882
you should confirm whether or
not they have allergies first.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.927
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I think
I need to go to the nurse.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.806
Is it all right if Zoya walks
with me?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.433
-I'm still kinda woozy.
-Yeah, of course.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.727
Okay. (BREATHES HEAVILY)

13:38.192 --> 13:39.568
Wait. Were you just faking it?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.986
No, I'm allergic to walnuts.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.072
So when I saw the Clif Bar
on old Spencey's desk,

13:43.155 --> 13:44.448
I seized the moment.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.908
So you intentionally gave
yourself anaphylactic shock?

13:45.991 --> 13:49.370
Well, at this point,
it ain't even a ride anymore.

13:49.954 --> 13:50.871
You coming?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.083
We-- we can't just skip school.

13:54.166 --> 13:54.959
Can't? Or won't?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.127
Hmm?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.298
Being good all the time
is not only exhausting,

14:01.382 --> 14:02.841
it's gotten you nowhere.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.594
Worse than that, in detention
and off scholarship.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.804
When's the last time you did
anything fun?

14:07.763 --> 14:11.308
Take a fucking day.
Just one, for you.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.601
It's all gone to shit anyways,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.687
and you haven't even been
able to enjoy it.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.146
Do you like cookies?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.815
(GIGGLES)

14:17.898 --> 14:19.608
I know where we can bake some.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.610
(SIGHS) Okay.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.071
♪ (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

14:24.154 --> 14:25.906
Dad?

14:30.327 --> 14:31.787
Grams!

14:31.870 --> 14:33.956
Merry Christmas, kiddo.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.791
What-- what are you doing here?

14:35.874 --> 14:37.793
Pops and I
couldn't stand the idea

14:37.876 --> 14:39.962
of you spending
the holidays alone.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.922
Wait. Pop-pop's here too?

14:42.006 --> 14:42.923
No, no. He's back in Danville

14:43.007 --> 14:46.343
getting the guest room ready
for you-know-who.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.804
-Dad?
-You're coming back with me.

14:48.887 --> 14:51.557
Oh, thank God.
Wait, I really need this.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.267
Just get out of the city
for a week,

14:53.350 --> 14:55.477
clear my head
over the holidays, reset.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.187
Oh, it's not just
for the holidays, hon.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.150
I'm taking you back home.
For good. (SIGHS)

15:01.233 --> 15:03.736
Um, don't think
I don't appreciate the offer.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.655
-I do. It's just--
-I do not know how you two

15:06.739 --> 15:08.157
live this high up.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.492

It always gives me the spins.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.952
JULIEN CALLOWAY:
You get used to it.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.912
Especially when it's
all you've ever known.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.708
Which brings me back to my point
about my leaving.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.501
That is not
the right thing for me.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.503
You are a minor.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.380
One living alone
in this apartment

15:23.464 --> 15:24.673
with no one to watch over you.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.425
I can take care of myself.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.926
Well, you shouldn't have to.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.055
Not with everything
going on right now.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.348
You mean my dad being--

15:32.431 --> 15:34.183
Please. Let's not get
into that yet.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.853
At least he's done
one thing right.

15:37.936 --> 15:41.023
He signed over the bulk of
his assets to you in trust,

15:41.106 --> 15:42.941
assigning us as legal guardians.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.612
I told him this city was
no place to raise a child.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.863
But did he listen?

15:47.946 --> 15:49.323
(SIGHS)
Look how that turned out.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.200
I'm fine.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.828
-I'm not him.
-He's not him, either.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.664
With all due respect, Grams--

15:56.747 --> 16:00.250
Anyway, I own this place now.
And I am not keeping it.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.919
So I don't get any say
in the matter?

16:02.002 --> 16:03.879
You're gonna take me away
from the only home

16:03.962 --> 16:06.924
I've ever known,
from my friends, my school?

16:07.007 --> 16:09.009
DONNA: Believe me,
it's the best thing for you.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.762

So, where do you like to hang?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.893
Uh, I don't know. The Met Steps?

16:17.976 --> 16:19.019
No you don't.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.271
-Dumbo Hall.
-You don't like that either.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.524
-Dimes Square?
-Hi. Could you use some help?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.150
What are you, Jeremy O. Harris?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.070
Wonder what she's got.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.115
No, he's my um...

16:31.198 --> 16:33.742
-No, we follow each other.
-Oh. Are you in his phone?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.327
-No.
-Then you're not his friend.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.578
Where do you go, girl?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.163
Come on, there's gotta
be at least one place.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.374
-Ooh, sexy nails. (SCOFFS)
-Uh...

16:40.457 --> 16:43.836
Everything you know and do
is your sister's shit.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.547
You don't even have
one piece of you

16:46.630 --> 16:48.340
-in this huge fuckin' city.
-ZOYA: I guess...

16:49.675 --> 16:50.426
Yeah, no, I don't.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.885
Okay. Well, it's time
to find you one.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.431
Mmm, but first we gotta
get you some art

16:55.514 --> 16:56.932
on these bougie-ass nails.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.059
Mmm... I'm not really
into nail art.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.228
Your sister's not really
into nail art.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.522
You're into anything
until you decide you're not.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.023
Okay? Come on.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.153
Settle an argument for us.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.113
Which is more ballsy,
breaking and entering

17:11.196 --> 17:12.781
or impersonating
a federal agent?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.159
It isn't a competition, Wendy.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.118
Everything is a competition.

17:16.201 --> 17:19.830
And aiding and abetting
either one is a crime,

17:19.913 --> 17:21.290
so do I wanna know?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.708
No crime occurred on my end.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.293
Tati very willingly took me up

17:24.376 --> 17:26.086
in her NoHo loft elevator
the other night.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.630
Is it my fault I have a memory
for things like codes?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.174
I'm living
in a Bushwick walk-up,

17:30.257 --> 17:31.216
and Tati lives in a NoHo loft

17:31.300 --> 17:34.094
-with an elevator code?
-You should see the place.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.930
She grew up in Syracuse,
so it's not family money.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.808
She certainly can't be making
that teaching private school.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.394
She's gotta be pulling money in
on the side.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.563
So while she was out at reiki,

17:44.646 --> 17:48.358
-uh, we snuck into her--
-We got her client list.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.651
Tati's an escort?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.653
JORDAN: No.
She's a private SAT proctor.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.655
One whose students,
based on all their records,

17:53.739 --> 17:57.326
seem to score in the 1500s.
Every single time.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.828
Is she a Rick Singer?
Is that what you found?

17:59.912 --> 18:00.954
Me? No.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.165
Federal Agent Rita Jones,
however, struck oil

18:03.248 --> 18:06.794
while placing a phone call
to one Natasha Rowley

18:06.877 --> 18:08.921
informing her that her son Cody
had been linked

18:09.004 --> 18:11.465
to a cheating scandal.
Took all of five minutes

18:11.548 --> 18:13.717
before she spilled names
of everyone involved

18:13.801 --> 18:16.011
