00:20.800 --> 00:21.760
Stand back!

00:25.480 --> 00:26.600
Kurt.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.760
I need you to stay behind the tape.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.440
Kurt.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.240
Let us do our job, man.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.400
Wallander.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.400
Katja Nilsson, student.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.320
She's a witness to the hit-and-run.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.280
A witness?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.600
She was seen on the CCTV from the club,
talking to the killer.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.720
I never saw any statement.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.800
I didn't get a chance to bring her in.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.000
You and I have a lot to discuss.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.760
-What you got?
-Wallet found on the victim, sir.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.040
What about her phone, Rez?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.200
Nothing yet, but we're looking for it.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.440
Kurt!

01:33.960 --> 01:35.080
Fuck.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.480
Stop! Police!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.800
Stop! Police!

01:51.880 --> 01:53.120
Hands above your head!

01:53.640 --> 01:55.280
Turn around! Slowly!

02:33.240 --> 02:35.360
Hey! Police! Don't move.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.160
Ah! Fuck!

02:38.240 --> 02:39.360
Shit!

02:40.240 --> 02:41.800
Freddie, he's gone round back!

02:41.880 --> 02:44.320
-You all right?
-Kurt's down! Go on!

02:46.560 --> 02:48.480
You all right, man? Fuck.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.520
-Hey.
-Yeah.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.560
Easy.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.640
Control, priority call, unit two.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.920
Officer down. We need medical assistance.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.560
Fuck!

03:26.920 --> 03:29.360
DO NOT CROSS

05:01.480 --> 05:03.400
-Hey. You're up.
-Hey.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.520
Yeah, I've been on the phone all night.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.360
We think we might get
a different result on appeal.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.640
Isn't that great?

05:09.720 --> 05:10.560
Great.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.560
How was your night?

05:17.040 --> 05:17.880
Kurt.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.560
Kurt?

05:26.120 --> 05:27.040
Hey.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.080
-God. What happened?

05:34.480 --> 05:36.280
-Come here.
-I'm fine.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.400
What happened?

05:46.800 --> 05:47.680
It's okay.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.680
This is not your fault.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.040
What happened to her is not your fault.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.000
You find the guy that did it.
That's who's responsible.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.440
Maybe Osei's right.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.720
I'm reckless, Mona.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.280
I should've stayed away.
I should never have gone back.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.640
No.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.480
If anyone's fit
to be a police officer, it's you.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.160
You care.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.840
You really do care about people.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.720
Fuck! All right! Fuck!

07:02.640 --> 07:05.000
-What?
-<i>I've been calling you all night.</i>

07:06.120 --> 07:07.200
Katja is dead.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.840
<i>Oh, God.</i>

07:08.920 --> 07:09.960
<i>Killed.</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:11.720
Jesus Christ.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.480
Kurt, there's nothing I can do.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.280
<i>I'm off the case.</i>

07:21.480 --> 07:23.400
-What?
Osei sent me home.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.000
<i>No. He can't do that.</i>

07:25.720 --> 07:26.920
He's made himself really clear.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.560
I put one more foot over the line,
and I'm gone for good.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.520
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

07:46.760 --> 07:48.240
You've suspended Rask?

07:50.600 --> 07:53.640
Detective Inspector Rask has been advised
to take a few personal days.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.840
While IA turn her career inside out?
They're setting her up.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.240
Right now I'd worry about my own career
if I were you.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.320
I read your report on Katja Nilsson.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.640
Standard operating procedures
exist for a reason.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.600
You canvas the area,

08:20.680 --> 08:23.080
located and identify witnesses,
take preliminary statements,

08:23.160 --> 08:27.000
and you bring in eyewitnesses
for formal interview immediately.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.240
If you don't like being lectured,
then stop behaving like a cadet.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.880
Last night, you managed
to lose control of the situation

08:34.960 --> 08:36.160
not once, but twice.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.160
I take full responsibility for my actions.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.520
Tell that to Katja Nilsson.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.520
Why are you here?

08:53.880 --> 08:55.560
Why do you wanna do this job?

08:56.400 --> 08:58.520
I genuinely have no idea.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.160
Pull it together.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.600
This unit will function as a team.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.560
That's not a request.
It's not an invitation.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.960
It's simply the way it's gonna be.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.160
We still have a killer to catch,
and we're a man down.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.080
I'm bringing in some new blood.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.680
Officer Abd Al-Rahman.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.000
-Reza?
-He's earned his spot.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.240
Let's see, maybe he can rein you in,

09:26.320 --> 09:28.600
show me if there's
anything worth salvaging.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.360
Bring him up to speed.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.320
Yes, sir.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.400
How do I look?

10:01.840 --> 10:04.000
-You cleaned up all right, didn't you?
-Yeah?

10:04.080 --> 10:06.160
So you went with a purple tie.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.520
It's a good choice, I guess.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.360
So this is it, yeah?

10:11.440 --> 10:13.320
-Yeah.
-Moving up in the world.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.440
I try.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.480
You got this.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.760
Thanks, Fred.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.040
Now get out of here
before you make Mama cry. Go on.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.200
-Come visit us in the trenches sometime.
-I will.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.760
Hey, look at this guy.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.960
First day. Thought I'd make an effort.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.040
You look great.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.920
-New one?
-Yeah, it is, actually.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.760
Look, uh, I heard about Rask.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.560
Is she okay?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.680
I don't know. I haven't had
a proper chance to talk to her yet.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.600
It just kinda feels like
I'm stepping in her grave a little, man.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.640
No, no, no, listen, we need you.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.280
-It's great to have you here.
-Yeah?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.280
She'll be back.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.880
All right. So, are we gonna catch
this bastard or what?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
This is our man.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.520
Katja spoke to the killer here,

11:08.600 --> 11:11.160
then led Elias down the alley
from outside the club.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.440
Do you think she was in on the killing?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.600
No, I don't. She was short on money.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.600
He probably paid her,
but why did she hide it from us?

11:21.680 --> 11:25.280
Maybe she didn't trust us,
thought she'd be an accomplice.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.680
What?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.880
-Nothing.
-No, come on, man. Seriously, what is it?

11:37.040 --> 11:38.240
No, it's just,

11:38.320 --> 11:41.200
you know, we waited a long time for this.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.640
Yeah, we did.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.520
Look at you getting soft on me.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.000
Feels good, man.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.280
So what do we have?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.080
We don't have a lot.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.200
There's so many questions.
Why use an unmarked police car?

11:58.720 --> 12:01.080
How did he know
Elias was gonna be at the club?

12:01.160 --> 12:03.320
How did he know
he was meeting his brother?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.360
Or maybe he followed him,

12:06.440 --> 12:08.440
you know,
waited for the right opportunity,

12:08.520 --> 12:09.840
and then improvised.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.800
He just doesn't strike me
like the kind of guy

12:13.880 --> 12:17.120
who, you know, sits around
and hopes for the best.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.840
No, he knew where Elias would be.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.320
He knew he'd be meeting Sören.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.800
Are we saying that the killer
was someone Elias knew?

12:27.360 --> 12:29.040
I believe we are, Detective.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.960
DO NOT CROSS
VIOLATION IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW

13:42.920 --> 13:43.880
It's clear.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.040
-You think it was the killer who broke in?
-Or Sören.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.400
Uniforms have already been through here.
What the hell are we looking for?

13:55.920 --> 13:59.200
Anything that could tell us something
about Elias's life.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.880
I mean,
I thought this guy was living on handouts.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.680
How could he afford all of this stuff?
Xbox, games, the fantasy stuff.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.800
This place doesn't look
like it's been touched.

14:22.640 --> 14:23.480
Hey.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.960
You jammy bastard.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.440
What's that? A secret stash?

14:29.520 --> 14:32.080
He spent his whole life
bouncing around foster homes.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.720
I guess you learn how to keep things safe.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.440
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, it's just the doc's checking in.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
<i>We need Sören Fager's new identity.</i>

14:50.520 --> 14:51.960
And his current address.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.680
I thought it was made clear--

14:53.760 --> 14:56.360
The criteria, yes,
for releasing that information,

14:56.440 --> 14:57.840
are perfectly clear,

14:58.520 --> 15:00.200
but now we have a dead girl and…

15:01.240 --> 15:05.280
Sören was with his brother
the night he was killed.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.320
Either he's involved in the murder,
or he's a target himself. Take your pick.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.480
Another examination?

15:25.560 --> 15:26.640
Is that necessary?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.080
Okay, all right.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.320
Rez, are you okay?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.760
-I can't breathe, Kurt.
-Hey, hey.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
I'm here.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.000
Want me to call an ambulance?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.000
-No!
-No?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.200
No, no. No.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.640
Listen. Listen, I think
you're having a panic attack.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.320
Okay? So just try
to breathe in and out, steady pace.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.720
Everything's gonna be fine, Rez,
I promise you.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.520
Thanks, Kurt.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.760
-You should talk to someone, Rez.
-I will.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.520
-There's no shame in asking for help--
-I said I will.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.680
I'll get it looked at, I promise,
but this stays between me and you, yeah?

16:30.760 --> 16:32.440
-Kurt, I'm serious.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.040
Not a word to anyone.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.960
Ah! So it's true!

16:50.040 --> 16:52.680
Detective Abd Al-Rahman.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.960
-Nice suit.
-Why, thank you.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.960
Elias's phone.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.880
We finally managed
to mine the data off the SIM card.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.720
There's a few stored numbers.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.160
Uh, I've used an algorithm
to fill in the blanks.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.760
Nothing to get too excited about.
A couple of pizza places, taxi firms--

17:09.840 --> 17:11.040
What are these numbers?

17:11.120 --> 17:14.280
Those are a couple of calls
to Social Security.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.320
-What about these?
-Yes.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.360
That is a series of calls
we couldn't identify. Sorry.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.320
Detectives.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.400
Modin.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.600
Good news.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.000
With the evidence from the club,

17:28.080 --> 17:31.160
Holmgren was forced
to release Sören Fager's new identity.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.600
His alias is Vincent Smed.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.320
We've got the address
of the halfway house he's been at.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.200
<i>Wallander, go with uniform</i>
<i>and bring him in.</i>

17:45.400 --> 17:47.160
Hi, I'm Detective Kurt Wallander.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.040
Staffan. Parole officer
for some of the residents here.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.040
We're looking for Vincent Smed.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.400
You're too late.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.000
He isn't here.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.800
He up and vanished yesterday.
Not a word to anyone.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.120
I have reported it.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.080
Is that unusual?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.600
Absconding? Yeah. It breaks
the terms of their parole.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.000
If they're caught,
they face more jail time.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.920
Any idea why he might risk that,
just getting up and leaving?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.040
No.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.080
<i>Yes?</i>

18:19.160 --> 18:20.680
Sören absconded last night.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.600
<i>I heard, from Probation Services</i>
<i>about ten minutes ago.</i>

18:23.680 --> 18:26.560
We're playing catch-up, Detective, again.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.280
-We could use Rask's help.
-She'll be back when she's back.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.440
Until then, report directly to me.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.040
Yes, sir.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.040
It must have been Sören
that broke into Elias's apartment.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.160
Why? Why risk leaving the halfway house?

18:42.240 --> 18:44.280
Maybe he thinks
he'll be safer on the move.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.720
Or he's on the warpath,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.880
trying to find
his brother's killer himself.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.120
Listen, if we don't track down
one of these guys soon…

18:50.200 --> 18:52.240
-More revenge attacks.
-Yeah.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.720
Brilliant.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.920
The answer's gotta be
in the past somewhere.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.760
Back to square one.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.640
Hey.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.600
-This is gonna require some coffee.
-Yup.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.560
All right.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.440
Jörgen Moberg, 46.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.320
Family man, no record.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.360
Found dead in the sauna.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.760
School swimming teacher.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.240
Oh, coached several youngsters
to national level.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.560
That's right.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.000
Mentored underprivileged kids
in his spare time.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.280
I mean, the guy's a saint,
pretty much loved by everyone.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.840
Rask was putting together a list
of people who knew Moberg.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.560
We've spoken to his wife, Sara.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.880
Let's call the others, see if we can
figure out who might wanna avenge him.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.680
All right.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.520
Yes. We're investigating
a possible murder of Elias Fager,

19:43.040 --> 19:46.080
and we're trying to track down
old colleagues of Jörgen Moberg.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.400
Yeah, that sounds great.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.640
Please do call me
if anything else comes to mind.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.760
-I see.
-Thank you.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.640
I wanted to talk to you
about Jörgen Moberg.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
…thing? No?

19:59.560 --> 20:00.480
Okay. Thank you.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.440
But I believe that you ran
an after-school club together.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.200
Yeah, he's here.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.200
I'm not gonna be able
to make it back today.

20:12.040 --> 20:12.880
Hey.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.800
Moberg's daughter, Alexia,
did you find out where she's living?

20:15.880 --> 20:19.320
I called, left messages,
and she hasn't replied yet.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.200
I'll call her mum in the morning.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.200
-Hungry?
-All right.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.280
Mm.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.840
Sauce?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.360
Thanks.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.120
Come on, man. We just started.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.000
<i>Hi, Sara.</i>
<i>This is Detective Wallander.</i>

20:47.080 --> 20:50.760
I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying
to get in touch with Alexia.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.640
I'd appreciate if you could
call me back. Thanks.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.240
I tried to get in touch with
Alexia Moberg, but she's not picking up.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.000
I can't find an address.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.920
You think she had something
to do with Elias's death?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.320
We need to talk
to everyone who was close to Moberg.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.160
Rask, these are the case files.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.800
I'm just keeping my hand in.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.720
-If Osei finds out--
-Who's gonna tell him?

21:49.120 --> 21:50.960
Did you call Sara?

21:51.600 --> 21:52.560
I tried.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.120
Okay.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.480
-No, I'm-- I'm not sure that's a good--
-Come on.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.120
That's why you're here,
isn't it? Hi, Sara.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.960
Yeah, I'm sorry, I know. I just…

22:07.760 --> 22:09.760
I have a question.
I need your help. Thanks.

22:10.280 --> 22:14.080
<i>Alexia runs a tech company</i>
<i>in the city, but she lives in Limhamn.</i>

22:14.160 --> 22:16.880
<i>The company owns the property.</i>
<i>That's why it's not listed.</i>

22:16.960 --> 22:19.800
<i>She enjoys her privacy</i>
<i>for obvious reasons.</i>

22:19.880 --> 22:21.560
<i>You can send her my regards.</i>

22:22.400 --> 22:23.760
<i>I will. Thanks.</i>

22:32.000 --> 22:33.760
Rask, really?

22:34.960 --> 22:36.120
We're here, right?

22:44.800 --> 22:45.840
Alexia Moberg?

22:46.520 --> 22:48.080
This is about Elias Fager.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.640
We're from the police.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.200
My mum said you'd be coming.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.720
Come on in.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.240
So, there's nothing that comes to mind?

22:58.600 --> 23:02.640
No. I really don't have
anything more to tell you about Jörgen.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.000
I'm sorry.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.200
Can you think of anybody who might be
inclined to try and avenge your father?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.040
No.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.440
What about students or colleagues, maybe?

23:19.520 --> 23:20.600
No.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.080
You knew Elias at school.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.520
Everyone knew him. Him and Sören.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.240
I'd try to avoid them.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.880
You and Sören had a run-in.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.480
It was a long time ago.
I can barely remember.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.200
Everything I remember,
I've already told the police.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.640
Your father disciplined Sören
in front of the whole class, didn't he?

23:40.320 --> 23:41.160
Yeah.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.080
Look, I really have to be getting on now,
so if there's nothing else--

23:48.160 --> 23:49.640
No, I believe that's it.

23:50.560 --> 23:51.960
Thank you for your time.

23:54.920 --> 23:58.040
Did you notice?
There weren't any pictures of her dad.

23:59.040 --> 23:59.920
Yeah.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.960
On the other hand, do you have
any pictures up of your dad?

24:03.480 --> 24:05.000
No, but I don't like my dad.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.920
I beat him with a broom, broke his nose.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.520
<i>I'd been drinking.</i>

24:40.600 --> 24:44.800
I hit him, but I don't remember
locking anyone in a fucking sauna.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.760
I told you, you fucking bitch!
We beat him up, and he deserved it!

25:57.760 --> 25:58.880
You look different.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.720
I just wanna-- I just wanna talk.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.440
-Okay.
-Okay?

26:06.520 --> 26:07.360
Okay.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.400
Uh, we've been looking for you.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.960
Yeah, well, you found me.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.400
We-- We need to talk about my brother.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.160
Yeah.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.680
I saw him.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.920
The night he died.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.640
He wanted to tell me something.
Don't know what it was.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.320
-I need your help.
-Okay.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.000
-I need your help.
-Yeah. All right, Sören. Let's talk.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.920
We can talk about whatever you want.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.320
-No! Fuck!

26:44.400 --> 26:45.840
Get off me, you fucking--

26:47.040 --> 26:47.880
-No!
-Please.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.560
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Just--

26:49.640 --> 26:51.560
-Just shut up! Please!
-Fuck!

27:02.520 --> 27:03.440
No!

27:09.880 --> 27:10.840
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.680
You all right?

27:16.880 --> 27:17.720
Mia's here.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.400
-We've been finishing some work.
-I should go. It's late.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.720
No, stay. I'm off to bed anyway.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.280
Oh, we've got
some food left if you're hungry.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.760
It's like I'm banging my head
against a brick wall.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.800
-It can't be all bad.
-No, it's not.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.680
It's just days like today feel
like one step forward and two steps back,

27:34.760 --> 27:37.360
and this whole investigation's just been…

27:39.200 --> 27:42.800
-I'm sorry, I-- I can't talk about it.
-Must just make it all the harder.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.760
How's it going with you two?

27:53.040 --> 27:55.560
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we're making good progress.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.720
This one's got the patience of a saint.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.440
And is keeping you up too late.
I'm gonna head off.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.760
Yeah, I hope tomorrow goes better for you.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.880
Thanks.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.080
How are you gonna get home?
Are you gonna be all right?

28:21.240 --> 28:22.920
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.160
I'm sorry.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.040
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't want to hurt you.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.520
I just need you to listen to me.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.080
I'm listening.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.400
My brother's gone.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.520
And I, uh…
I need you to find out who killed him.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.400
We're doing everything that we can.

28:46.000 --> 28:46.880
Are you?

28:48.120 --> 28:52.040
Because you had nothing but hate
for me and my brother.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.960
That's not true.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.640
-That's not true. I was just doing my job.
-You called me an animal.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.000
<i>You called me an animal, didn't you?</i>

29:11.640 --> 29:12.600
Didn't you?

29:18.920 --> 29:19.760
I did.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.400
I think I'd already decided

29:26.400 --> 29:28.320
that you were responsible
for what happened

29:28.400 --> 29:30.760
before I ever set foot
in that interview room.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.320
-Yeah.
-But Elias was so young.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.440
And I thought I was doing the right thing.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.960
But I should have done more for you,
and I'm sorry.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.440
You're gonna help me
find out who did this.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.880
"I thought of you again today."

30:25.640 --> 30:29.200
"It's so sad that people are afraid
of you and your brother."

30:29.720 --> 30:33.240
"If only people knew
how beautiful you were on the inside."

30:35.040 --> 30:37.000
"Thank you. You saved my life."

30:37.080 --> 30:39.080
"I am eternally grateful to you,

30:39.760 --> 30:43.000
"but you understand
that this must remain our secret."

30:43.920 --> 30:44.880
"Forever."

30:45.400 --> 30:46.680
Uh, "I love you."

30:48.040 --> 30:49.080
Look at the date.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.360
This is a few months after I went inside.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.680
Who was he trying to save? Huh?

30:57.560 --> 30:59.560
Elias was trying to tell me something.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.840
What was he… Was it this?

31:00.920 --> 31:02.800
-I don't know.
-Come on! You're the detective!

31:02.880 --> 31:03.760
I don't know!

31:09.560 --> 31:11.840
-Where did you get these?
-At his flat.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.040
Who is this?! Who is it?

31:14.640 --> 31:18.440
I don't know. Elias, he never mentioned
anybody else to me.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.960
He was my brother.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.560
He should've told me.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.200
I swear to you

31:31.320 --> 31:34.760
that I will do everything I can
to find the man that killed Elias.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.240
Well,

31:39.880 --> 31:41.040
you find him.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.120
Because if I find him, I'll kill him.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.120
I'll rip his fucking throat out.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.520
-This can't end well.
-Nope.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.400
I'll drink to that.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.240
Hi.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.080
Yeah, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.680
Could you, um…
I need you to come and meet me, please.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.200
Yeah, it's important.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.640
I've called it in.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.640
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.520
He didn't hurt me.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.720
We'll get him.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.920
He broke his parole. There's
already a warrant out for his arrest.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.280
Okay.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.440
You need to see these.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.040
Someone was writing to Elias

34:59.760 --> 35:01.240
after the Moberg attack.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.840
Sören thinks they have
something to do with all of this.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.160
-Who are they from?
-I don't know.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.560
Neither does Sören.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.360
Oh, I'll get Wallander on it.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.120
Come on. This is my case.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.960
I can handle it. You know me.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.480
You need to keep out of it.

35:26.280 --> 35:30.440
I understand how hard this is,
but you're too close.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.600
We're going to be
under even more scrutiny now.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.800
I can't have you anywhere near it.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.960
You realize how much
you have on the line here.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.360
If the original case was flawed…

36:04.360 --> 36:05.200
Thanks.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.520
Figure out how this guy got in here.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.480
-Are you all right?
-Uh, yeah.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.800
Sorry I didn't pick up.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.240
Sören found these in Elias's apartment.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.360
What is it?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.160
Love letters.

36:21.720 --> 36:22.720
A teenage crush?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.760
Maybe. Who knows?

36:24.840 --> 36:25.680
I'm off.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
-Stay with her.
-I will.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.600
-Large one?
-Lovely.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.280
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.160
I don't think he came to hurt me.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.160
I genuinely think
he didn't know where else to go.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.000
Sören said
Elias had something to tell him.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.800
Hours later, he turns up dead.

37:04.880 --> 37:08.160
What could Elias have known
that he wanted to tell Sören?

37:08.240 --> 37:09.480
I don't know.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.680
The letters?

37:13.240 --> 37:14.880
Kurt, what if I missed something?

37:14.960 --> 37:16.640
Sören admitted to the murder.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.960
No, he admitted to attacking Moberg.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.200
His DNA was
all over the body and the crime scene,

37:22.280 --> 37:24.640
but he says
that his memory of the evening was patchy.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.800
He was drunk, high, he was young.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.920
You're saying he didn't do it?

37:31.120 --> 37:33.920
All I'm saying
is there's new information on the table.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.240
Did you see Alexia?

37:41.760 --> 37:42.920
Yeah, we did.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
And?

37:45.960 --> 37:47.960
There's something she's not telling us.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.280
-Morning.
-Morning.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.080
How you feeling?

38:24.760 --> 38:25.680
I'm okay.

38:27.560 --> 38:30.440
-Sorry to make you do this.
-It's not a problem.

38:34.160 --> 38:38.240
All right, let's go through
what happened last night, step by step.

38:38.760 --> 38:39.600
Take your time.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.200
I was getting ready for bed.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.960
I was really tired. It'd been a long day.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.520
I didn't notice anything unusual.

38:49.040 --> 38:52.120
I was on the couch in the living room.
My back was to the door.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.560
I was watching something.
I had my headphones in.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.120
That's why I didn't hear anything.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.120
I looked up.
Sören was in the room with me and…

39:03.640 --> 39:04.600
It's all right.

39:06.040 --> 39:06.960
Take your time.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.640
I'm glad it was you.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.440
Sorry?

39:17.160 --> 39:19.440
Afterwards, I'm glad it was you that came.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.160
Of course.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.320
It's good to see you.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.560
I know it's been a long time.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.400
I couldn't talk to you then.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.960
Taking this job, coming to Malmö
was a coward's way out.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.120
-I can't even imagine what it must've--
-Stop.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.480
I can't do this.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.800
It's too late.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.280
I have a family now.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.520
I'll send someone in
to take your statement.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.440
Sure.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.400
He's nice.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.600
-What's his name?
-Maverick.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.360
Yeah, he's wonderful.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.720
I've told you all I know, Detective.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.480
I know you wanna
put everything behind you,

41:20.560 --> 41:23.560
but I'm afraid there's some more questions
I need to ask you.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.600
I think I have nothing else to say.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.360
You haven't told us everything, have you?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.960
We need your help, Alexia.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.840
If there's anything you haven't said
about your father,

41:35.920 --> 41:38.560
it's extremely important
that you tell me now.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.920
This investigation is
about more than Elias Fager.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.680
A few days ago, a young student,
Katja Nilsson, was killed.

41:46.280 --> 41:50.800
There's a connection between the murders,
and if we don't have all the information,

41:50.880 --> 41:52.680
if we don't have the big picture,

41:52.760 --> 41:54.680
more innocent people could die.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.200
I'm sorry, I--

41:57.280 --> 41:59.120
Listen, think about it,

41:59.200 --> 42:01.640
and if you change your mind,
please get back to me.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.360
Detective, wait.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.120
I should've told someone this before,
but I couldn't.

42:31.960 --> 42:35.080
I couldn't do it to my mum.
It would've destroyed her.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.640
Jörgen was not a nice person.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
What do you mean?

42:45.800 --> 42:46.960
He was a monster.
