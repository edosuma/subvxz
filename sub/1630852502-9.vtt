Witnesses saw him push Mr.
Abdullah off that roof.

20:28.666 --> 20:31.118
I need your patient to
confirm that story.

20:31.143 --> 20:32.774
That's why I'm here.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.611
How can Khaled be sure

20:34.636 --> 20:37.134
that after he speaks to
you, you won't report him?

20:37.159 --> 20:39.454
Because Mr. Abdullah
is the victim here, sir.

20:39.479 --> 20:40.907
And I'm just trying to help.

20:41.094 --> 20:43.763
I don't care where he's from,
or what his status is.

20:43.788 --> 20:46.805
One way or the other, I am
gonna have to talk to him.

20:48.220 --> 20:50.337
Before you said you
couldn't tell me anything,

20:50.362 --> 20:52.048
and now you're allowed to?

20:52.659 --> 20:54.149
Did Laura change her mind?

20:54.482 --> 20:56.637
We have discretion if we believe

20:56.662 --> 20:59.438
a patient isn't in a position
to care for themselves.

21:00.771 --> 21:02.405
You're saying she isn't?

21:03.024 --> 21:04.696
Laura is, um...

21:05.066 --> 21:08.376
is exhibiting signs of
paranoid delusions.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.485
She claims that you are not her father.

21:10.679 --> 21:12.266
She doesn't know who I am?

21:12.291 --> 21:14.391
Our staff psychiatrist
is speaking with her now,

21:14.416 --> 21:16.595
and he's gonna want to
speak with you too.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.204
Could it be schizophrenia?

21:20.229 --> 21:21.743
Well, we can't...

21:21.768 --> 21:25.423
I mean, we're not jumping to any
conclusions without more information.

21:25.448 --> 21:28.970
But does... does Laura have a
history of mental illness?

21:29.989 --> 21:34.063
Her mother was diagnosed with
schizophrenia when Laura was young.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.673
It was an uphill battle for a few years.

21:37.698 --> 21:41.102
I did everything I could,
she didn't come home.

21:41.490 --> 21:43.091
I should have seen the signs.

21:43.116 --> 21:46.665
Was Laura exhibiting
behavioural changes?

21:47.059 --> 21:49.938
She's seemed tired,
she was losing weight.

21:50.201 --> 21:52.002
Putting pressure on herself.

21:52.027 --> 21:55.071
A lot of busy people don't take the
time to eat or sleep properly.

21:55.104 --> 21:57.610
So you couldn't have known
anything based on that.

21:57.635 --> 22:00.141
Well, I guess I could've
rationalized most of it...

22:00.977 --> 22:04.321
until today, when she's talked
about dropping out of school,

22:04.346 --> 22:06.719
agitated in a way I'd never
seen from her before.

22:06.744 --> 22:07.946
Well, Laura is here now,

22:07.971 --> 22:10.922
and we're gonna do everything
you can to help her.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.305
What if you can't?

22:12.578 --> 22:15.063
What if it ruins her life
like it did her mother?

22:23.646 --> 22:26.169
You're going to help me get out of here.

22:26.194 --> 22:28.042
Instead, you talked to the police?!

22:28.067 --> 22:29.802
He says he's only here to help.

22:29.864 --> 22:33.199
- And you believe him?
- I don't think we have a choice.

22:34.498 --> 22:36.607
You mean I don't have a choice.

22:38.257 --> 22:41.794
Feeling up to a quick exam?
It's easy, I promise.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.810

22:44.056 --> 22:45.757

22:46.012 --> 22:47.607
No, um...

22:47.632 --> 22:51.068

finding new ways to hate each other.

22:51.093 --> 22:52.349

22:52.374 --> 22:55.935
I want you to look at the pen,
but don't move your head, okay?

22:56.311 --> 22:58.838
Do you think my legs
will get better?

22:58.863 --> 23:01.982
Because I don't know what I'm
gonna do if I can't walk anymore.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.466
What I can tell you is we're
gonna do everything possible

23:04.491 --> 23:07.209
to find out what's causing
this, and to treat it.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.839
Can I get you to touch each finger
with your thumbs, like this?

23:12.990 --> 23:14.147
Well,

23:14.172 --> 23:17.419
must take a ton of training
to dive at such a high level.

23:17.683 --> 23:19.427
Yeah, um...

23:19.452 --> 23:21.669
Two hours before school,

23:21.694 --> 23:23.888
then two hours after school.

23:24.007 --> 23:26.775
And on the weekends. So, you know...

- pretty light.

for anything else though, huh?

23:35.268 --> 23:37.769
I don't really
get to see my friends.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.748
And I pretty much live in a Speedo.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.505
Why don't you swing your legs
over the side of the bed?

23:43.530 --> 23:44.809
Okay.

23:45.271 --> 23:47.740
Now just hang them
all the way over and relax.

know you feel that way?

23:58.388 --> 24:01.849

that's keeping them together.

24:02.664 --> 24:04.185
It's kinda stupid.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.865
I'm almost killing myself

24:05.890 --> 24:08.892
instead of just being
straightforward with my parents.

24:08.917 --> 24:10.351
Ah, it's normal,

24:10.376 --> 24:13.068
to not want to upset the
people you're closest to.

24:13.604 --> 24:17.099
But that's a lot of pressure
to put on yourself, Trey.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.374
Yeah, I know.

24:22.568 --> 24:23.982

three have his angiogram?

Dr. Mitchell?

24:43.322 --> 24:45.864
Was she uh, was she cooperative?

24:45.889 --> 24:48.138
She was extremely agitated,

24:48.354 --> 24:51.392
and it's too soon to establish
if she can be discharged safely.

24:51.417 --> 24:54.372
I've given her some haloperidol
which will hopefully calm her.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.131
I was hoping I was wrong.

24:56.390 --> 24:57.757
Does that mean a Form 1?

24:57.782 --> 24:59.278
Hopefully we don't get there.

24:59.303 --> 25:01.595
If she's lucky, this could
be an isolated incident.

25:01.620 --> 25:04.963
Yeah, but family history makes
schizophrenia more likely, right?

25:04.988 --> 25:06.591
It could be hereditary, yes,

25:06.616 --> 25:09.653
but even with the history,
we need more information.

25:09.678 --> 25:11.310
Well, we know she's
been having delusions,

25:11.335 --> 25:12.755
she stopped taking care of herself,

25:12.780 --> 25:14.670
she's talking about
dropping out oh school.

25:14.695 --> 25:15.982
It's all classic symptoms.

So you're a fan of textbooks,
Dr. Leblanc?

25:18.767 --> 25:22.466

diagnosis is long and slow,

25:22.491 --> 25:24.888
and patience is crucial.
It's important not to rush.

25:24.913 --> 25:27.124
The father's desperate for answers.
He's gonna want to talk to you.

25:27.149 --> 25:29.911

down to see him as soon as I can.

Yeah. 15-year-old

of lower extremity muscle weakness
and spontaneous paralysis.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.653
Brisk reflexes, symmetrical.

26:27.888 --> 26:29.122
Kid lost control of his legs,

26:29.147 --> 26:30.669
missed a dive and almost died

26:30.694 --> 26:32.929
instead of telling his parents he
didn't want to compete anymore.

26:32.954 --> 26:35.817
- It's a tricky differential.
- I had a patient with similar symptoms.

26:35.842 --> 26:37.341
Turned out to be Transverse Myelitis.

26:37.366 --> 26:39.060
I thought it might be that too

26:39.085 --> 26:40.857
but the clinical course
has been intermittent,

he trains regularly, or...?

to exertion?

him my entire life story?

I wanted you to know.

your money for medical school?

You were just trying
to buy me and hurt her

fight for every penny.

42:03.311 --> 42:04.948
You've got plans tonight?

42:04.973 --> 42:07.820
Well, there's a glass of wine
with my name on it at home.

42:07.845 --> 42:09.800
- You?
- Mm-mm.

42:11.367 --> 42:13.117
Hey, Claire?

42:15.302 --> 42:17.121
Have a good night.

42:18.210 --> 42:20.415
Don't stay here too late.

42:25.784 --> 42:29.433
_

42:29.458 --> 42:31.302
Hmm, football and food.

42:33.113 --> 42:36.892
Did I tell you about my championship
game when I was 18?

42:37.143 --> 42:39.604
- A header to win...
- In extra time.

42:39.629 --> 42:42.064
You mentioned it once or twice.

42:42.203 --> 42:43.933
(FOOTBALL GAME PLAYING ON PHONE)

42:44.162 --> 42:46.049
Can you stay? Watch with me?

42:46.161 --> 42:49.654
Only if I don't
have to hear that story again.
