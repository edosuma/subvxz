WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.536
SABRINA:
Jimmy.

00:02.570 --> 00:05.273
VIRGINIA:
Jimmy, wake up, sweetie.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.340
Jimmy!

00:07.641 --> 00:09.343
JIMMY:
What happened?

00:09.377 --> 00:10.644
I don't remember anything.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.513
We were watching TV
and you fainted.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.382
Welcome back to Inside Probe.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.217
We looked at a small town

00:16.250 --> 00:20.188
in the grips of a serial killer
named Lucy Carlyle.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.189
JIMMY:
Oh, yeah.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.124
We were watching
Inside Probe.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.392
I remember that.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.760
We got to know the simple family

00:26.794 --> 00:28.562
who brought her down.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.064
This is familiar.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.199
I-I remember that.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.501
But not before the son,
Jimmy Chance,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.236
got her pregnant.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.271
Lucy was tried and convicted.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.540
There was even
a jailhouse wedding.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.275
Okay. Yep, it's all
coming back to me.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.476
I remember that.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.379
And we showed you
the incredible news...

00:45.413 --> 00:49.383
Lucy was somehow not executed.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.285
I'm alive!

00:55.389 --> 00:56.690
I don't think
he remembered that.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.094
Whoo!

01:00.128 --> 01:01.362
* Here we go

01:01.395 --> 01:04.498
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:05.833 --> 01:08.102
What is this on
my head?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.337
Maw Maw's
hemorrhoid pillow.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.105
You keep banging your
head on the floor.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.640
Lucy's alive.
deal with it.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.177
So, you're a scumbag
who murdered your boyfriends

01:16.210 --> 01:18.746
and the good people of
America found you guilty.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.314
And yet

01:20.348 --> 01:22.383
you survived execution.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.617
What was that like?

01:23.651 --> 01:24.852
It was pretty wild, Nancy.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.288
Pretty (bleep) wild.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.390
LUCY: I was nervous because
things didn't look good.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.259
And then...

01:31.292 --> 01:33.294
everything went black.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.664
The next thing I knew,

01:36.697 --> 01:39.467
I was being drawn
to this light at the end

01:39.500 --> 01:42.270
of a very long hallway.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.338
It was just like you see
in those

01:44.372 --> 01:46.240
news magazine show
reenactments.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.576
Oh, and there's this faint
whiff of lavender in the air.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.312
Love lavender. Got a candle
in my office. Go ahead

01:51.345 --> 01:53.281
Well, I got to the light

01:53.314 --> 01:55.883
and he appeared.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.786
Hello, Lucy.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.488
She got to meet
Ed Begley Jr.?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.656
I hate her. I hate her so much.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.124
You are not welcome here.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.230
Hop on, sugar boobs.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.365
We've been waiting for you.

02:14.835 --> 02:15.836
(laughing)

02:19.540 --> 02:21.309
And the next thing I knew,

02:21.342 --> 02:22.343
I was back.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.246
GUARD:
Oh! Oh, oh!

02:25.279 --> 02:28.216
Well, needless to say,
everyone was a little shocked.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.185
I don't mean shocked like...
(imitating electric current)

02:31.219 --> 02:33.954
I mean shocked like, like
surprised-- (gasps)

02:33.987 --> 02:35.823
I mean, she was "shocked."

02:35.856 --> 02:36.824
W-We were surprised.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.726
(laughs)

02:38.759 --> 02:40.428
Anywho.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.263
We didn't handle it very well.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.564
NANCY GRACE:
Fueled by fear,

02:43.597 --> 02:46.400
the guards gave Carlyle
a beating

02:46.434 --> 02:49.837
that no decent human being
could feel was justified.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.805
Kick her ass!
Yes!
Harder!

02:51.839 --> 02:53.974
In the head!
In the head!
Come on!
(laughs)

02:54.007 --> 02:57.711
Back from the dead
and brutalized by prison guards,

02:57.745 --> 03:00.848
the scumbag serial killer
lawyered up.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.983
And who better
to represent a scumbag

03:03.016 --> 03:05.853
than this skid mark
of a bleeding heart

03:05.886 --> 03:08.956
defense lawyer, Sylvia Barnes.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.725
Well, here we
are again, Sylvia.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.893
That's an ugly scarf.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.628
Anyway, this was

03:14.662 --> 03:17.598
a dream case: a beautiful
client, abuse of power,

03:17.631 --> 03:20.401
and a defendant with pockets
deep enough to pay for

03:20.434 --> 03:22.770
my experimental
foot reduction surgery.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.639
You did have some fat,
old sidewalk slappers, sister.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.441
Guilty.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.711
The state screwed up,
and the last thing they wanted

03:30.744 --> 03:32.980
was the public to know about it.

03:33.013 --> 03:37.551
So they secretly dropped all
charges and cut Lucy Carlyle
a fat check.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.253
But she's been gone
two years.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.888
W-Where's she been?
Shh!

03:40.921 --> 03:42.723
Nancy will get
it out of her.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.958
So it's been two years.
Where you been?
Well, the last thing

03:44.992 --> 03:46.894
I wanted to do
is stick around town

03:46.927 --> 03:49.397
where everyone would look at me
like I was a serial killer.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.365
And after almost
going to Hell,

03:51.399 --> 03:54.368
I decided I probably needed
a little spiritual guidance.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.670
Ed Begley Jr. gave me
a second chance and...

03:56.704 --> 03:58.639
I wanted to make the most of it.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.509
NANCY GRACE: So Lucy Carlyle's
odyssey of faith

04:01.542 --> 04:04.278
brought her to these men.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.615
These monks taught her
to love rather than hate,

04:07.648 --> 04:08.616
much like TV's Monk

04:08.649 --> 04:10.984
taught America to laugh.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.753
We miss you Tony Shalhoub,

04:12.786 --> 04:14.422
you were a treasure.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.690
But something was missing
in her life

04:16.724 --> 04:21.429
and no amount of meditation
and tofu could fill it.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.397
But now you're going back
to Natesville

04:23.431 --> 04:24.932
where you have some
unfinished business

04:24.965 --> 04:26.367
to take care of.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.935
That's right, Nancy.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.339
I'm gonna fight
for custody of my daughter.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.908
Son of a bitch.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.910
He popped my ass pillow.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.550
A serial killer
suing for custody?

04:42.583 --> 04:43.984
It's a joke, right?

04:44.017 --> 04:45.553
I wish it were.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.821
But Lucy's lawyer doesn't joke.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.056
I know,

04:49.089 --> 04:51.692
I dated Sylvia Barnes
in law school.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.561
I lost her respect
in the bedroom

04:53.594 --> 04:54.962
by trying a few things

04:54.995 --> 04:57.398
that I should have asked
permission for first.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.599
I'm not gonna lose
her respect

04:58.632 --> 04:59.967
in the courtroom.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.935
But you're the only lawyer
we can afford.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.004
Most attorneys don't list
their hourly fees

05:04.037 --> 05:05.839
with "or best offer"
next to it.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.108
And there's a reason I do that.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.377
I'm a terrible lawyer.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.911
I make most of my money

05:10.944 --> 05:14.582
selling antioxidant
super juices.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.949
Which, by the way,
are guaranteed

05:15.983 --> 05:18.386
to improve your health.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.621
Doctors proved that...
with science.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.989
We don't need
any juice,

05:22.022 --> 05:23.924
we need a lawyer.
I agree.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.926
You don't need any juice.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.895
But this isn't just any juice.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.963
Wally, she's a
serial killer.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
This is a slam dunk.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.534
And this is your chance
to finally beat

05:33.567 --> 05:34.868
a famous ex-girlfriend.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.970
Once she sees what a man
you are in the courtroom,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.772
maybe she'll give you
another shot in the bedroom.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.641
All right. I'll do it.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.742
(quiet laugh)

05:41.775 --> 05:43.143
Let's celebrate...

05:43.176 --> 05:45.613
with a couple
of glasses

05:45.646 --> 05:48.482
of liquid healthiness.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.117
We're not paying
for that juice.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.159
Got my courtroom
outfit down.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.962
Maw Maw bought this
to be buried in.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.432
I don't think she expected
to be living past the '80s.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.899
I like it.

06:05.933 --> 06:06.867
You look like the hooker
from Pretty Woman

06:06.900 --> 06:08.702
but in the movie
where she's a lawyer, so...

06:08.736 --> 06:10.003
(doorbell rings)

06:13.907 --> 06:16.076
What the hell are you doing
here, you crazy lunatic!

06:17.077 --> 06:18.679
If you're here
to kill someone,

06:18.712 --> 06:19.813
I'm ready to go.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.750
I wanted to see if
we could talk and...

06:22.783 --> 06:24.552
maybe avoid
the craziness of court.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.420
See if there's another way

06:26.454 --> 06:28.188
to deal with
Princess Beyonce's custody.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.623
Her name is Hope.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.924
Aw, aren't we adorable,

06:30.958 --> 06:32.460
arguing like a married couple?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.027
Maybe that's because,
technically,

06:34.061 --> 06:35.929
we are still a married couple.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.698
Till death do us part.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.567
And I didn't die.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.769
Can you still say
that Iranian guy's name?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.737
Mama Ramabadmamajama...

06:43.771 --> 06:45.506
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.941
2,000 volts through her skull,
she's still got it.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.677
Anyway, here's my plan:

06:49.710 --> 06:51.779
You and Hope come with me

06:51.812 --> 06:53.180
to Tibet.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.915
Excuse me!

06:54.948 --> 06:55.749
He has a girlfriend.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.018
I'm talking
to my husband, bitch!

06:58.051 --> 06:59.487
Well, you want to...
Easy!

06:59.520 --> 07:00.988
She's a murderer
and you weigh 60 lbs.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.155
Are you stupid?

07:02.189 --> 07:03.791
My daughter and I,
we're not moving

07:03.824 --> 07:05.058
halfway across
the country, to Tibet,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.794
to live with a serial killer.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.161
I was in a marching band

07:08.195 --> 07:10.731
that went all the way
to the state championships,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.933
but all you can see
is a serial killer.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.535
Yeah, well,
murdering three men

07:14.568 --> 07:16.169
kind of trumps a flute solo.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.071
Well, you know what? You're
never gonna see me again.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.140
'Cause I'm taking
my daughter to Tibet,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.943
where people are spiritually
evolved, bitches.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.912
Namaste.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.151
What the hell
is "Namaste"?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.253
Sounds like some
kind of fancy pepper.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.955
Why would she
say "pepper"?

07:34.988 --> 07:36.089
I don't know, Jimmy.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.224
She's nuts.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.526
This shouldn't
take long.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.127
Once the jury finds out
what she did,

07:40.160 --> 07:41.261
we'll be out of
here by lunch.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.564
That should leave time for you
to stop on the third floor

07:43.597 --> 07:44.231
and get a quickie divorce.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.003
You made a big
mistake leaving me.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.572
Admit it.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.206
Our time together
was the highlight

07:53.240 --> 07:55.008
of your life, baby.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.610
Did we go out or something?

07:56.644 --> 07:57.711
Twice.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.713
I took you to a
Journey concert.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.081
You let me sit up
on your shoulders.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.885
I used to look like this.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.721
Doesn't ring a bell.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.723
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.858
That stings.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.993
Are we Quakers
now or something?

08:13.026 --> 08:15.863
Why the hell
does this church have no music!

08:15.896 --> 08:16.764
(gavel banging)

08:16.797 --> 08:18.766
Does counsel have
any motions to bring

08:18.799 --> 08:21.034
before I call in the jury
and start the trial?

08:21.068 --> 08:23.070
Motion to suppress evidence

08:23.103 --> 08:25.706
of my client as
a serial killer.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.140
SYLVIA:
The charges were
officially dropped

08:27.174 --> 08:29.209
as part of our lawsuit
against the prison,

08:29.242 --> 08:32.012
so she cannot be characterized

08:32.045 --> 08:34.915
by crimes that technically
never happened.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.118
That's stratospherically
illogical and I don't like it.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.286
JUDGE:
But it's legally sound.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.121
Motion upheld.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.623
JUDGE:
There may be no mention

08:42.656 --> 08:44.792
of Ms. Carlyle's
string of cruel,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.326
heinous murders.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.562
Yeah, b-b-but she killed
a bunch of people!

08:48.596 --> 08:50.263
Your Honor, he mentioned
the heinous murders

08:50.297 --> 08:51.699
and you told him not to.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.000
Strike that from the record.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.836
Unreal. I can't believe
this is happening.
Relax.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.805
We're still gonna
beat these jerks,
right, Wally?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.072
It's a small town.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.641
There's not
a juror around who's

09:00.674 --> 09:02.109
not gonna remember her face

09:02.142 --> 09:03.376
from the Boyfriend
Killer trial.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.947
I mean, you'd have to be living
under a rock this whole time.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.081
What?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.019
It's the Natesville Dozen.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.024
The miners who were
trapped for six months?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.060
You picked 12 men

09:20.093 --> 09:21.929
who were literally

09:21.962 --> 09:24.364
living under a rock

09:24.397 --> 09:26.700
during Lucy's trial?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.201
I didn't pick them.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.371
I thought the gentlemanly
thing to do

09:31.404 --> 09:33.907
was to let the lady
select the jurors.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.175
They do have a choir!

09:35.208 --> 09:36.677
Oh, goody!

09:36.710 --> 09:39.179
"This Little Light of Mine."

09:41.982 --> 09:44.852
JURY:
* This little light of mine

09:44.885 --> 09:46.820
* I'm gonna let it shine

09:46.854 --> 09:48.121
* This little
light of mine... *

09:48.155 --> 09:51.091
This is all blowing
my mind, man.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.326
It's blowing my
simple human mind.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.363
* Let it shine,
let it shine. *

10:03.136 --> 10:04.738
I don't believe this.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.974
We can't bring up
that she's a serial killer?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.041
That was our
whole case.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.643
Everybody just relax.

10:09.677 --> 10:13.413
Look, this jury is gonna
see you as a lovely family

10:13.446 --> 10:16.884
who does a great job
taking care of this girl.

10:16.917 --> 10:20.754
No one will be able to
change their minds about that.

10:20.788 --> 10:24.157
I'm sure you all see these
people as a lovely family

10:24.191 --> 10:27.928
who does a great job
taking care of this girl.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.263
Well, today...

10:30.297 --> 10:32.432
I'm gonna
change your minds about that.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.935
Well played, counselor.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.103
SYLVIA:
My client and I

10:36.136 --> 10:39.006
have spent the last 12 months
researching these people,

10:39.039 --> 10:42.342
and have found a number
of witnesses who can testify

10:42.375 --> 10:44.912
to this family's character,

10:44.945 --> 10:46.980
or lack thereof.

10:47.014 --> 10:47.948
And then he grabbed my shirt

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
and he said if I flirted
with his girlfriend,

10:50.183 --> 10:51.151
he'd kick my ass.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.053
And who did that to you?

10:53.086 --> 10:54.087
That man.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.288
That full-grown man.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.192
What up, girl?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.194
Did you notice
I got my braces off?

11:04.064 --> 11:05.766
Would you say that
the Chance family

11:05.799 --> 11:08.101
was addicted to illegal
sports gambling?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.203
I'd bet my ass on it.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.739
And trust me, honey,

11:11.772 --> 11:13.974
that's a bet I'd love to lose.

11:14.007 --> 11:14.908
But I wouldn't.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.276
And there she was,

11:16.309 --> 11:18.478
just peeing in a bucket
in the front yard.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.113
I took a picture

11:20.147 --> 11:22.182
with my phone!

11:22.950 --> 11:25.986
(guffawing)

11:26.019 --> 11:28.789
They used their baby monitor
to eavesdrop on my conversation.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.023
Then that crazy bitch

11:30.057 --> 11:31.124
threw the monitor

11:31.158 --> 11:32.125
through my window.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.827
Uh, the great grandmother

11:33.861 --> 11:35.763
paid me to pretend
to kidnap Burt

11:35.796 --> 11:37.865
and he went right along with it

11:37.898 --> 11:39.299
and abandoned the
little boy.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.869
And then when I came back
to apologize for it,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.070
20 years later,

11:43.103 --> 11:45.272
they hit me with a TV...

11:45.305 --> 11:46.506
a bunch of times.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.208
They did that to me, too.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.877
That's because we just
found out you were...

11:49.910 --> 11:51.945
Don't say it!

11:51.979 --> 11:54.214
Then Jimmy and his friend
suddenly jumped me and started

11:54.247 --> 11:56.349
hitting me just because
I used to have a penis.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.318
Man, I miss that thing!

11:58.351 --> 12:00.053
Talk about a hasty decision.

12:03.156 --> 12:07.094
Man, that smack on the head
still makes me so dizzy,

12:07.127 --> 12:08.896
I got to take prescription drugs

12:08.929 --> 12:10.530
that I actually have
prescriptions for.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.265
Anyway, it really sucks

12:12.299 --> 12:13.934
'cause I drive
my own tour bus now.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.136
Yeah. Of course the gigs
are drying up.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.471
So I use it
to deliver pizzas.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.841
In fact, I got some, uh,

12:20.874 --> 12:22.109
coupons here, if you don't mind.
Yeah?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.177
These are good
through the end of the month.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.846
JIMMY:
It took awhile

12:25.879 --> 12:27.314
but eventually,
Lucy's lawyer ran out of people

12:27.347 --> 12:29.182
to make us look bad.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.451
And then it was our turn
to call up people

12:31.484 --> 12:33.453
who had good things
to say about us.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.056
And James has never
broken an egg bagging groceries.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.959
Those are the same delicate
hands that handle Hope.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.961
JIMMY: Friends know
all the best things about you.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.096
But they also know the worst.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.798
Yes.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.000
I was hired to pretend to be
their caterer on Thanksgiving

12:47.034 --> 12:49.102
when they broke into a nice
house in order to convince

12:49.136 --> 12:50.237
Burt's parents he was wealthy.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.105
B-B-But when
we ran out of there,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.907
we left a ton
of gourmet spices

12:53.941 --> 12:56.509
and a Japanese knife
I miss like crazy.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.947
Jimmy Chance is a jerk
and he should lose his daughter.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.185
Sorry, buddy, but I feel
like we'd be able to hang more

13:05.218 --> 13:06.987
if the kid was out of the way.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.990
* Lucy's lawyer is compelling

13:10.023 --> 13:12.325
* Her legal command is

13:12.359 --> 13:14.161
* Impressive but those are
lies she's telling *

13:14.194 --> 13:15.863
* About the Chances.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.098
You were asked
to state your name.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.068
It's Shelley.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.871
Yeah, Jimmy, he's a great guy.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.005
He's really honest.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.506
He even told me about the time

13:26.539 --> 13:28.175
he tucked his penis
between his legs

13:28.208 --> 13:30.410
and danced around to
"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."

13:30.443 --> 13:31.979
(laughter)

13:32.012 --> 13:34.381
(whispers):
Sorry, Jimmy, I'm under oath.

13:34.414 --> 13:38.151
But you only have to tell
the truth about things they ask!

13:38.185 --> 13:41.321
Don't ask me about
his porn collection.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.223
If it weren't for
Jimmy and his parents,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.125
I wouldn't have
my seeing-eye pig.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.259
In my opinion,

13:46.293 --> 13:49.029
the Chances are
a strong, close-knit

13:49.062 --> 13:50.363
African-American family.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.099
Sir...

13:52.132 --> 13:54.201
the Chances are Caucasian.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.904
Really? What about Eminem?
Caucasian.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.572
Really? Bryant Gumbel's
white, right?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.208
African-American.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.910
Well...

14:02.943 --> 14:05.545
obviously I'm not
a reliable witness.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.180
JIMMY:
Our friends couldn't help us,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.016
so we tried to help ourselves.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.319
Look, maybe we weren't
the perfect parents.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.422
Maybe my son
has some issues,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.290
and maybe he
made some mistakes

14:17.324 --> 14:20.427
and accidentally put
his daughter in danger.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.494
But...

14:21.528 --> 14:23.430
(sighs)

14:23.463 --> 14:25.899
(whispers):
The rest of the
speech washed off.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.068
JIMMY:
Mom practiced answers for
anything they could ask her,

14:28.101 --> 14:30.938
but when the pressure was on,
she went blank.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.173
I personally believe that...

14:33.206 --> 14:36.276
U.S. Americans...

14:36.309 --> 14:39.146
in our nation...

14:39.179 --> 14:41.048
are unable to do so

14:41.081 --> 14:42.215
because some parents...

14:42.249 --> 14:45.986
in America...

14:46.019 --> 14:47.554
Out there...

14:47.587 --> 14:49.122
are not...

14:49.156 --> 14:51.191
having wet naps.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.592
Is she speaking in tongues?

14:52.625 --> 14:55.662
So I believe that...

14:55.695 --> 14:58.165
our wiping products,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.167
like... such as,

15:00.200 --> 15:02.502
in South Africa...

15:02.535 --> 15:06.673
and in the Iraq...

15:06.706 --> 15:08.375
JIMMY:
Eventually, I took the stand,

15:08.408 --> 15:11.544
and I realized that
I was Hope's only chance

15:11.578 --> 15:13.546
of staying Hope Chance.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.648
I showed pictures I drew

15:15.682 --> 15:19.186
of the cool things
I had done with my daughter.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.253
And I mentioned
Hope's collection

15:20.287 --> 15:22.389
of interesting rocks,
which I think

15:22.422 --> 15:23.556
impressed the miners.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.126
And eventually,
I just spoke from the heart.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.296
I-I'm sorry, I mean, is it
a crime to live at home

15:29.329 --> 15:30.597
with people you love?

15:30.630 --> 15:33.633
Look, we're broke.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.103
Hope is stuck living in a tiny,
crowded house.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.072
And when you're stuck in a tiny
space with a bunch of people,

15:39.106 --> 15:39.973
a lot of stuff happens

15:40.007 --> 15:42.675
that you don't want
anyone to know about.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.178
Probably stuff you wish
no one ever found out.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.650
But she's with good people,

15:50.683 --> 15:54.587
who stick together,
and find ways to laugh,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.424
and we work out our problems
even when we're pissed.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.128
And when you have people
like that in your corner,

16:01.161 --> 16:03.296
then you've got
the important stuff,

16:03.330 --> 16:06.699
a-and you'd be fine
stuck living in a cave.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.301
(applause)

16:12.072 --> 16:14.307
JIMMY:
We were warned
it could take the jury a while

16:14.341 --> 16:16.209
to come to a decision,

16:16.243 --> 16:18.545
so we were very surprised
when we were called

16:18.578 --> 16:21.781
to come back in so quickly.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.616
Turns out the miners

16:23.650 --> 16:25.018
that have been trapped
underground together

16:25.052 --> 16:28.355
don't really want to be stuck
in a small room together.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.332
(snoring quietly)

16:39.366 --> 16:42.369
The jury awards custody
of Hope Chance

16:42.402 --> 16:45.038
to her mother, Lucy Carlyle.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.440
JIMMY:
I thought my big speech
had won the jury over,

16:47.474 --> 16:49.609
but apparently the thing
miners miss the most

16:49.642 --> 16:51.111
when they're trapped
underground are their moms.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.313
Maybe this
will finally convince you

16:53.346 --> 16:56.083
to stop coming to me
for legal help.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.055
(clamoring)
JUDGE: Order!

17:02.089 --> 17:03.090
Order!

17:03.123 --> 17:04.491
Do you validate parking?!

17:04.524 --> 17:07.094
The next person who talks
will be found in contempt!

17:07.127 --> 17:08.628
You can't do this!

17:08.661 --> 17:11.364
* I saw her today

17:11.398 --> 17:14.634
* At the reception

17:14.667 --> 17:16.636
* At her feet was her

17:16.669 --> 17:21.074
* Footloose man

17:21.108 --> 17:27.247
* No, you can't always
get what you want *

17:27.280 --> 17:30.383
* And if you try sometimes

17:30.417 --> 17:32.185
* You'll find

17:32.219 --> 17:34.554
* You get what you need

17:34.587 --> 17:38.158
*

17:46.833 --> 17:49.269
* I saw her today

17:49.302 --> 17:51.171
* At the reception

17:53.573 --> 17:55.142
* A glass of wine...

17:55.175 --> 17:57.844
Yeah, sure, you're
gonna miss your father.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.747
But he could've
come with us to Tibet.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.817
* She was going to meet
her connection *

18:04.851 --> 18:07.454
* At her feet was her

18:07.487 --> 18:09.356
* Footloose man

18:10.890 --> 18:16.429
* You can't always
get what you want *

18:16.463 --> 18:21.668
* You can't always get
what you want *

18:21.701 --> 18:25.438
* But if you try sometimes

18:25.472 --> 18:28.241
* You might find

18:28.275 --> 18:30.710
* You get what you need

18:30.743 --> 18:33.813
* Oh, yeah

18:38.785 --> 18:41.921
* And I went down

18:41.954 --> 18:44.224
* To the demonstration

18:44.257 --> 18:46.193
* To get my

18:46.226 --> 18:49.262
* Fair share of abuse

18:49.296 --> 18:52.432
* Singing we're gonna vent

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
* Our frustration

18:54.801 --> 18:57.437
* If we don't,
we're gonna blow *

18:57.470 --> 18:59.739
* A 50-amp fuse

18:59.772 --> 19:01.208
* Sing it to me

19:01.241 --> 19:02.675
* You can't always get

19:02.709 --> 19:05.612
* What you want

19:05.645 --> 19:07.847
* You can't always get

19:07.880 --> 19:11.518
* What you want

19:11.551 --> 19:17.557
* You can't always
get what you want *

19:17.590 --> 19:19.626
* But if you try sometimes

19:19.659 --> 19:21.328
* Well, you just might find

19:21.361 --> 19:24.264
* You get what you need

19:24.297 --> 19:26.366
* Oh

19:26.399 --> 19:30.203
* Baby, yeah

19:30.237 --> 19:32.905
* Oh, yeah

19:32.939 --> 19:35.642
* I went down

19:35.675 --> 19:37.344
* To the Chelsea Drugstore...

19:37.377 --> 19:39.646
You love her, don't you?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.348
Yeah.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.915
Of course I do.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.385
But I love my daughter, so...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.254
this is what has to happen.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.227
I want you to know
that what I'm about to do,

19:54.261 --> 19:56.696
I'm doing for my daughter.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.299
Because she...

19:59.332 --> 20:02.269
deserves to grow up
in a happy family.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.876
* I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy

20:09.909 --> 20:12.812
* Yeah, and he said
one word to me *

20:12.845 --> 20:14.781
* And that was dead

20:14.814 --> 20:16.516
* I said to him

20:16.549 --> 20:18.518
* You can't always

20:18.551 --> 20:21.721
* Get what you want

20:21.754 --> 20:25.758
* You can't always
get what you want, no *

20:27.294 --> 20:30.963
* But if you try sometimes,
you just might find *

20:30.997 --> 20:34.033
* You get what you need

20:34.066 --> 20:37.970
* Oh, yeah! Whoo!

20:47.947 --> 20:50.317
(tires screeching)

20:52.752 --> 20:53.886
Dude!

20:53.920 --> 20:56.956
You were right, Carl,
that was a bad idea.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.125
Trevor, you're up, buddy.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.998
* You get what you need

21:06.032 --> 21:08.368
* Oh, yeah...

21:08.401 --> 21:11.404
Okay, well,
that worked out, huh?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.039
So, I'm gonna give you
custody back,

21:13.072 --> 21:15.007
but I saw some disturbing things

21:15.041 --> 21:16.809
during the course of the trial.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.311
So promise me

21:18.345 --> 21:19.979
that you'll try
to do a better job

21:20.012 --> 21:20.980
raising Hope in the future.

21:21.013 --> 21:21.948
Definitely.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.316
We make mistakes,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.150
but we always learn from them.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.452
That's true.
It seems like every week

21:25.485 --> 21:27.687
we learn a new lesson.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.490
I would like to confess
to killing my husband.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.962
JUDGE: Okeydokey.
Well, I guess that does it.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.831
That's all, folks.
