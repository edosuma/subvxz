00:00.704 --> 00:03.858
- What's he doing?
- I am a British citizen

00:03.977 --> 00:06.132
<i>being held hostage and will be executed</i>

00:06.159 --> 00:09.379
<i>at sundown tomorrow if all Al
Shabaab fighters are not released.</i>

00:09.407 --> 00:11.083
Lance Corporal Georgie Lane.

00:11.782 --> 00:13.408
SHE SOBS

00:14.313 --> 00:17.270
Extraction complete.
Primary recovered. Repeat,

00:17.453 --> 00:18.868
primary recovered.

00:18.988 --> 00:22.220
Raynott re-entered the
country on August 28th.

00:22.259 --> 00:24.739
And he's been following me

00:25.177 --> 00:27.540
and I'm shit scared because
I don't know what to do.

00:27.739 --> 00:30.779
The terror threat is now
escalated to critical...

00:31.048 --> 00:32.890
Attack expected imminently.

00:35.539 --> 00:37.939
I can't be happy with
you again. It's too late.

00:37.939 --> 00:40.793
- Georgie, don't go...
- Elvis, please!

00:42.613 --> 00:44.394
I'm leaving the army.

00:44.805 --> 00:46.459
All I want to do

00:47.036 --> 00:48.362
is marry you.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.400
Wow.

00:58.672 --> 01:00.658
London looks incredible.

01:01.391 --> 01:02.744
It's nice in here, innit?

01:02.971 --> 01:04.209
Up in the clouds.

01:04.375 --> 01:07.777
It's just a little pre-wedding
treat before the chaos begins.

01:08.282 --> 01:09.819
Can't we stay here forever?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.579
Away from the world.

01:12.466 --> 01:14.314
Away from them two, of course.

01:14.536 --> 01:17.311
Yeah, I'm not going to
miss close protection.

01:24.902 --> 01:26.800
We're so vulnerable, aren't we?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.579
You see, I thought you were
about to say something romantic

01:30.589 --> 01:32.154
about the night sky.

01:34.075 --> 01:36.161
You can take the girl out of the army...

01:40.512 --> 01:43.186
You are gorgeous when
you smile, you know that?

01:43.519 --> 01:44.929
Hm!

01:45.667 --> 01:47.487
Well, how about when I frown?

01:50.877 --> 01:53.369
- That's not a great look.
- No.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.143
Well, I promise I'll
be smiling on Saturday.

01:56.959 --> 01:58.285
One more week

01:58.329 --> 02:01.187
and I'll be out of the army
and those two will be gone!

02:01.858 --> 02:03.933
And no-one will ever bother us again.

02:05.692 --> 02:06.979
Cheers!

02:08.699 --> 02:10.252
Cheers!

03:35.885 --> 03:37.810
- Are you serious?
- Yes, boss.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.464
That's a massive error of judgment.

03:39.475 --> 03:40.485
Why?

03:40.512 --> 03:41.489
You're seriously having a free bar

03:41.529 --> 03:43.210
- and inviting Two Section to your wedding?
- Yeah.

03:43.221 --> 03:44.430
There's only one way
that's going to end.

03:44.447 --> 03:46.610
Well, you're going have to keep
them in check for me, aren't you?

03:46.799 --> 03:47.886
Thought you were going to start moaning

03:47.892 --> 03:48.851
about me leaving the army.

03:48.855 --> 03:50.915
Well, I think that's a massive
error of judgment, as well.

03:51.035 --> 03:52.628
After what I've been through!

03:52.748 --> 03:54.789
Look, I've been keeping up to
date with your psyche evaluation.

03:55.656 --> 03:57.760
- Is that allowed?
- Not the details, obviously.

03:57.769 --> 03:59.149
Just that you're progressing nicely.

04:00.254 --> 04:02.132
Look, I've told you,
you're a fine soldier.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.378
Don't throw your career away so soon.

04:05.795 --> 04:07.309
I've made my decision, boss.

04:08.428 --> 04:10.206
I just wish the world could get along.

04:10.326 --> 04:12.626
Well, good luck with that. Two
Section can't even get along.

04:12.746 --> 04:15.556
Oi, Medic! You going to find
out how my recovery went or what?

04:15.578 --> 04:17.137
Mansfield, button it.

04:17.726 --> 04:19.005
Parade!

04:19.348 --> 04:21.721
Parade, attention!

04:23.662 --> 04:24.785
As they were, Kingy.

04:25.154 --> 04:26.939
Stand at ease!

04:27.059 --> 04:28.249
Stand easy.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.606
Final mission-specific
training before Syria.

04:30.868 --> 04:32.333
Well, you look after them for me, boss.

04:32.368 --> 04:34.499
Oh, I wish you were coming with
us so you could do exactly that.

04:34.704 --> 04:36.830
16-mile tab, full kit.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.322
Good stuff, Kingy.

04:38.659 --> 04:40.360
Anyone not putting a shift in,

04:40.671 --> 04:42.495
- you let me know.
- Boss.

04:42.535 --> 04:43.884
You not coming with us Georgie,

04:43.893 --> 04:46.015
- one last time and all that?
- No, you're all right.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.311
See you all on Saturday.

04:47.524 --> 04:49.415
Where I have reassured
Lance Corporal Lane

04:49.428 --> 04:50.845
your behaviour will be exemplary.

04:50.965 --> 04:53.078
- Exemplary, boss.
- Right, guys.

04:53.104 --> 04:54.637
Once you've sorted all your kit out,

04:54.654 --> 04:57.188
see you down at the
armoury in five minutes

04:57.473 --> 04:58.685
for all weapons.

04:58.863 --> 04:59.826
Let's crack on!

05:06.262 --> 05:07.479
What are you doing here?

05:07.714 --> 05:09.485
I am officially in Manchester

05:09.503 --> 05:12.002
until Abu is apprehended or neutralised.

05:12.122 --> 05:13.423
Any developments?

05:13.649 --> 05:15.304
Nah. Still questioning
his accomplice, though.

05:15.340 --> 05:16.281
And?

05:16.356 --> 05:17.688
Nothing as yet.

05:18.212 --> 05:19.597
Don't worry. He'll break.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.948
Big day Saturday, then.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.674
Yeah. Yeah. It's not a secret.

05:27.769 --> 05:28.719
All right. Well,

05:28.839 --> 05:31.232
- I'll crack on.
- Yeah, I'm going to... OK. Bye.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.519
Have we definitely got everybody?

05:40.519 --> 05:41.628
- I feel like someone's missing.
- Yeah.

05:41.645 --> 05:42.512
No, everybody's out there,

05:42.534 --> 05:44.549
- we've just got to mix it up a bit more.
- Right, OK. Well, let's put

05:44.580 --> 05:45.832
Dave and Jon there

05:45.841 --> 05:47.748
- and Janet and Polly and Pete on that one.
- Why?

05:47.768 --> 05:49.823
Dave and Janet and Polly
and Pete together? Why?

05:49.837 --> 05:51.514
Are you completely bonkers?!

05:51.546 --> 05:53.898
- Probably.
- She married you for starters!

05:53.907 --> 05:55.428
Look, if we have all
his family on one side

05:55.428 --> 05:57.686
- and all ours on the other...
- Dad, isn't that supposed to be

05:57.703 --> 05:59.515
- what happens in church, anyway?
- Butt out, Marie.

05:59.538 --> 06:01.531
Yeah, but people will want to
sit next to people they know.

06:01.553 --> 06:03.822
In the church, yes. But
not here in the reception!

06:03.839 --> 06:06.018
People want to sit next to new people.

06:06.036 --> 06:07.429
That's all I'm... Georgie?

06:07.451 --> 06:09.653
Each table should have
family from both sides.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.834
Thank you. That's all I'm saying.

06:10.852 --> 06:13.628
I just want people to sit
next people that they know.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.816
- What are you doing now?
- PHONE RINGS

06:14.816 --> 06:16.201
- _
- Just give me a chance. Just give me...

06:16.517 --> 06:19.260
This! This is exactly why
no-one should ever get married.

06:19.269 --> 06:20.756
Thank you for your words of wisdom.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.548
I can't speak. What do you want?

06:23.548 --> 06:24.738
Cab driver's just called in,

06:24.756 --> 06:26.766
he's picked up someone
matching Abu's description.

06:27.486 --> 06:30.780
- Was it definitely him?
- Yes. We think it's him. Almost certain.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.933
Matched it to CCTV in the street.

06:33.568 --> 06:35.343
Did the driver say where he dropped him?

06:35.361 --> 06:36.489
Somewhere by the canal.

06:36.524 --> 06:38.988
- There's no CCTV there, though.
- Oh, you're joking.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.911
DOORBELL RINGS

06:41.031 --> 06:42.673
Everything's going to be OK. All right?

06:42.882 --> 06:44.097
I've got to go.

06:44.508 --> 06:45.633
Shit.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.228
Mum!

06:58.768 --> 07:00.908
- Hi.
- Hi. Come in.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.653
Come in. Come in. Come in.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.494
A bit of a mad house in there. So, er...

07:05.494 --> 07:07.030
So if you change your mind...

07:07.265 --> 07:09.329
He's not going to change his mind.

07:10.178 --> 07:12.094
We thought we'd just
meet your family, then

07:12.108 --> 07:14.398
- get out of your hair.
- Yeah. Come through.

07:16.121 --> 07:17.151
Hi.

07:19.478 --> 07:21.174
How lovely to see you all!

07:21.209 --> 07:23.913
Gary, Faith. This is my
mum and dad, Grace and Max.

07:23.936 --> 07:24.855
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

07:24.868 --> 07:26.728
- Hello.
- Hello, Max.

07:26.748 --> 07:27.966
And then my sisters,

07:28.086 --> 07:30.079
- thing one and thing two.
- Hi.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.597
Oh, and my nan.

07:31.832 --> 07:33.035
Lovely to meet you.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.145
What's your name, love?

07:34.158 --> 07:35.530
- Faith.
- Faye.

07:35.703 --> 07:36.653
Harry.

07:36.853 --> 07:39.002
- Gary.
- No, Gary, Nan. Gary.

07:39.331 --> 07:41.195
- Gary.
- Faith and Gary, yeah.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.676
And can I just say...

07:44.748 --> 07:46.531
with God's pencil we could
not have not have drawn

07:46.558 --> 07:47.907
- a better son-in-law!
- Aww.

07:47.938 --> 07:50.082
What a lovely thing to say, thank you.

07:54.688 --> 07:56.082
I should have got a two-bedder.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.127
You got a one-bedder so
your parents wouldn't stay.

08:01.404 --> 08:03.051
Do you think they're
shagging in our bed?

08:03.246 --> 08:04.502
- Aw!
- What?

08:04.511 --> 08:06.158
Don't pretend you weren't
thinking exactly the same.

08:06.188 --> 08:07.828
Believe it or not... that is

08:08.102 --> 08:09.958
the furthest thing away from my mind...

08:09.980 --> 08:12.603
I said we should have
slept on the sofabed!

08:12.657 --> 08:14.370
Er, wouldn't hear of it, Mum.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.835
He's a gent, Faith.

08:15.866 --> 08:17.828
That's because I was
the pushy black mum.

08:17.837 --> 08:20.381
All right, Mum. Go to
bed. Stop over-sharing.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.869
Someone's been a busy boy.

09:25.838 --> 09:27.227
You could have made more of an effort,

09:27.241 --> 09:28.595
considering it's your last week.

09:28.715 --> 09:30.166
Didn't look that fast to me.

09:30.326 --> 09:32.004
It was a CFT, thicko.

09:32.026 --> 09:33.393
Wasn't meant to be fast.

09:33.722 --> 09:34.672
Thought you might like to know

09:34.685 --> 09:36.408
that we've raided Abu's safe house.

09:37.025 --> 09:38.201
I mean, he'd long gone, but

09:38.219 --> 09:39.937
found a big haul of explosive materials.

09:39.948 --> 09:41.535
Forensics are going over it all now.

09:42.308 --> 09:43.936
And tell your sister to
update her privacy controls

09:43.936 --> 09:45.317
on Facebook, will you?

09:45.352 --> 09:47.230
What, you stalking her, you weirdo?

09:47.350 --> 09:48.646
Not me, no.

09:48.766 --> 09:49.894
Who is?

09:52.157 --> 09:53.378
Abu?

09:54.767 --> 09:56.263
He'd printed off pictures of you

09:56.281 --> 09:57.515
and stuck them to his wall.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.409
Do you think he knows about the wedding?

10:06.105 --> 10:07.974
We're not discarding any possibility.

10:08.014 --> 10:10.127
Is it safe to go ahead? What?

10:11.166 --> 10:12.708
We just need to be
certain that you're safe.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.065
Well, how can we be certain!?

10:14.078 --> 10:15.672
We don't know what
the hell he's planning.

10:16.724 --> 10:18.828
That's why we need to
figure out his target.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.182
It could be anywhere.

10:20.195 --> 10:21.687
More likely to be
somewhere that's important

10:21.687 --> 10:24.058
or significant to him.
It's personal now, George.

10:24.668 --> 10:26.442
Anyway, the mother wants to meet you.

10:27.937 --> 10:29.442
- Abu's mother?
- Yeah.

10:30.308 --> 10:32.079
She wants to ask your forgiveness.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.423
Counter Terrorism think you might

10:34.436 --> 10:36.283
be able to extract some useful intel.

10:39.004 --> 10:39.994
Might reveal something to you

10:39.999 --> 10:41.340
that she hasn't been revealing to us.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.028
A word, please, mate.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.626
I haven't got any cash on me,

11:14.644 --> 11:16.207
if you're going to try
and tap me up for a fiver.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.281
So why did you get transferred
up here, then, Elvis?

11:22.586 --> 11:23.914
Er, you know,

11:24.092 --> 11:26.480
- just thought I'd, er...
- Stop you there, pal. Rhetorical question.

11:26.498 --> 11:27.923
I think I bloody know why, don't I?

11:29.486 --> 11:30.783
She's leaving the army

11:30.787 --> 11:32.097
and starting a new life.

11:32.812 --> 11:33.864
Back off.

11:34.947 --> 11:36.492
What am I supposed to do... ?

11:37.428 --> 11:39.514
- I know you, Elvis.
- And you love me, Charlie.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.245
Indeed. Warts and all.

11:41.582 --> 11:42.825
And it's your warts I'm worried about

11:42.828 --> 11:44.140
and their effect on Georgie.

11:44.890 --> 11:46.218
Now, leave her alone.

11:46.622 --> 11:47.748
Understood?

11:50.564 --> 11:52.140
Is that another rhetorical question?

11:52.260 --> 11:53.224
Yes,

11:53.810 --> 11:55.834
now fuck off and let me
get on with some real work.

11:56.068 --> 11:57.370
Yes, sir.

11:58.933 --> 12:00.188
See you later.

12:03.349 --> 12:04.796
I mean, the thing is...

12:05.240 --> 12:07.131
The table displays are all very nice.

12:08.716 --> 12:12.152
Something simple for the centre
of the table, I always think.

12:15.425 --> 12:17.308
Is there a cost implication?

12:17.428 --> 12:18.843
All taken care of.

12:19.393 --> 12:21.121
Which ever one you think, guys.

12:21.889 --> 12:23.283
What about allergies?

12:24.837 --> 12:26.337
I think you should meet her.

12:27.452 --> 12:29.809
I'll come with you if
you like. Moral support.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.956
Thanks for agreeing to this, Lane.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.066
Sir.

13:22.486 --> 13:25.114
Top of the hill, first bench
on the left, green jacket.

13:35.938 --> 13:36.988
Georgie Lane?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.069
Yeah.

13:38.877 --> 13:40.462
How was your journey?

13:40.788 --> 13:42.948
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

13:43.068 --> 13:45.447
- Did you come down from Manchester?
- Yeah.

13:45.668 --> 13:46.748
Train?

13:48.928 --> 13:52.067
They say Guy Fawkes'
conspirators came up here to watch

13:52.466 --> 13:54.335
Parliament explode.

13:55.588 --> 13:57.549
It's a good place to watch London burn.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.874
Millions of people down there.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.868
No idea we're up here watching them.

14:08.668 --> 14:09.872
Do you know where he is?

14:09.992 --> 14:11.239
Where he might be?

14:13.348 --> 14:15.119
If you only came for information,

14:15.239 --> 14:16.846
you're going to be disappointed.

14:20.158 --> 14:21.548
We need to find him.

14:24.545 --> 14:26.308
I don't know where he is!

14:32.286 --> 14:34.421
He had a girlfriend at university.

14:35.384 --> 14:36.512
Saira.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.582
Her parents took her up to Manchester.

14:42.654 --> 14:43.857
She was a Muslim.

14:44.616 --> 14:47.680
So do you think Saira got
him interested in Islam?

14:48.159 --> 14:50.064
I think he was in love with her.

14:50.610 --> 14:51.817
And, erm,

14:52.678 --> 14:55.120
he wanted to know everything
he could about the religion,

14:55.160 --> 14:56.108
for her.

14:58.014 --> 15:00.025
Then he started going to the mosque.

15:02.112 --> 15:03.688
But then it went way,

15:04.336 --> 15:05.632
way beyond.

15:06.053 --> 15:07.474
It... Sorry.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.325
It's OK.

15:11.909 --> 15:13.068
Go on.

15:16.414 --> 15:18.559
Then Saira finished with him.

15:18.825 --> 15:20.468
I mean, he was heartbroken.

15:21.590 --> 15:23.055
Then angry.

15:25.347 --> 15:27.300
But I tried my best, you know?

15:32.148 --> 15:33.828
I don't know who my son is.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.748
I was hooded...

15:48.101 --> 15:50.197
... thrown in the
backs of vehicles, I was

15:50.587 --> 15:52.243
beaten, kicked...

15:52.749 --> 15:53.917
... abused.

15:54.965 --> 15:57.148
Physically and mentally tortured.

16:04.748 --> 16:06.463
I had my head held back,

16:07.240 --> 16:08.514
by my hair...

16:10.965 --> 16:12.628
... while they spat at me.

16:17.064 --> 16:18.853
I got told that I was going to die.

16:21.228 --> 16:22.334
Filmed

16:22.662 --> 16:24.278
begging for my life.

16:26.773 --> 16:28.642
All for your son's pleasure.

16:31.988 --> 16:34.067
And the more pain and torment I was in,

16:34.089 --> 16:36.296
the closer to heaven your son felt.

16:36.508 --> 16:38.191
- I'm so sorry...
- No, it's fine.

16:41.436 --> 16:43.789
I don't want you to be nice to me. OK.

16:45.468 --> 16:47.668
You wanted to understand what I...

16:47.668 --> 16:49.063
I went through.

16:53.165 --> 16:55.945
My friend died in my... in my arms.

17:02.377 --> 17:04.667
I'll never get her blood off my hands.

17:08.175 --> 17:10.012
You know, every day I look down...

17:12.161 --> 17:13.662
... and I can imagine it.

17:17.031 --> 17:18.400
So sorry...

17:21.948 --> 17:23.575
My arms were chained

17:23.953 --> 17:25.252
so high,

17:25.986 --> 17:28.268
the pain was so intense,
that I wanted to give up.

17:30.936 --> 17:33.178
I had boots on my head,

17:33.298 --> 17:34.559
their hands

17:35.474 --> 17:36.779
all over my body...

17:36.788 --> 17:38.665
- But they rescued you.
- Yeah.

17:41.868 --> 17:43.233
But, you know...

17:44.663 --> 17:47.268
... I wonder if, er, Abu...

17:47.491 --> 17:48.730
Jason...

17:49.432 --> 17:50.936
if he would've...

17:55.673 --> 17:58.342
I wouldn't have these
thoughts in my mind, you know?

18:03.308 --> 18:04.809
Do you think he's evil?

18:05.719 --> 18:07.747
I mean, do you think there's no hope,

18:08.302 --> 18:12.261
that he's just pure evil?

18:19.252 --> 18:20.416
Yeah.

19:07.331 --> 19:08.365
Thank you.

19:08.818 --> 19:09.988
Right, so go on.

19:10.043 --> 19:11.996
Well, they're analysing
every little flicker.

19:12.165 --> 19:13.628
- What, upstairs?
- Yeah.

19:13.648 --> 19:15.490
Psychologists working
with Counter Terrorism.

19:15.610 --> 19:16.631
Anything else?

19:17.039 --> 19:19.196
They found a phone that
Al-Shawadify has been using.

19:19.316 --> 19:20.190
And?

19:20.683 --> 19:22.392
Photos of potential targets.

19:24.026 --> 19:25.287
Including my wedding?

19:25.531 --> 19:26.659
No.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.661
You're about to be called in
to see the Brig anyway, though.

19:28.728 --> 19:29.611
Why?

19:29.628 --> 19:31.588
Wants to err on the side of caution.

19:33.061 --> 19:34.832
Get you to move your
wedding back a day or so.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.466
- Oh, piss off.
- I'm being serious.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.304
Yeah, on the back of
your recommendation!

19:38.824 --> 19:39.908
I'm only thinking about you.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.247
No, you're thinking of
yourself. You're a fucker.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.379
Look, it's not a big deal, Mum!

19:47.388 --> 19:49.465
You're here all week. We're
just pushing it back by a day.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.268
Tell her my mum's ringing round.

19:51.459 --> 19:52.662
Did you hear that, Mum?

19:52.702 --> 19:54.594
Grace is calling round
to all the guests...

19:54.763 --> 19:56.726
- Yes, the honeymoon is booked...
- _

19:56.779 --> 19:59.629
Look, Georgie say's it's
for everyone's safety, yes.

19:59.788 --> 20:01.205
Mum, Mum,

20:01.245 --> 20:03.304
Mum, I've got to go... I love you. Bye.

20:03.380 --> 20:04.916
- How you doing?
- Er, yeah. I'm ready.

20:05.151 --> 20:06.505
OK, cool. We've got to go.

20:06.785 --> 20:07.717
Got to go.

20:11.663 --> 20:14.735
_

20:14.753 --> 20:17.714
_

20:19.348 --> 20:20.649
All right, close your eyes.

20:20.769 --> 20:22.389
- No.
- Go on.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.367
Open.

20:30.970 --> 20:32.188
What do you reckon?

20:34.228 --> 20:36.337
This is Wayne Rooney's house.

20:36.457 --> 20:37.531
No.

20:38.432 --> 20:39.861
But it could be ours.

20:40.588 --> 20:42.929
What?

20:51.869 --> 20:53.654
- Hello.
- Hi. Hiya.

20:53.863 --> 20:55.368
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

20:55.376 --> 20:56.797
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you again.

20:56.828 --> 20:58.293
Lovely to see you again...

21:00.593 --> 21:02.788
Erm, shall I just leave you to it, then?

21:02.788 --> 21:05.112
- Yeah, thanks. We'll have a look round.
- Thank you.

21:07.340 --> 21:10.323
Oh. It's so much bigger
than it was on the internet!

21:10.528 --> 21:12.361
- This was the one you picked, right?
- Yeah.

21:12.379 --> 21:13.875
Dream house? Yeah?

21:13.948 --> 21:16.148
Wow. It's frigging massive.

21:16.148 --> 21:18.681
We need 'frigging massive' with
all the kids we're going to have.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.544
You see, all we need now

21:23.512 --> 21:24.976
is a goal in the garden.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.207
I just can't imagine myself living
in a place like this, you know?

21:33.434 --> 21:35.374
I know, it's amazing, isn't it?

21:36.822 --> 21:38.779
Yeah, it's beautiful.

21:39.361 --> 21:41.709
Wow, the garden's huge.

21:42.229 --> 21:43.476
Well, we'll get a gardener.

21:44.489 --> 21:45.741
So what am I going to do,

21:46.358 --> 21:47.983
be a lady who lunches?

21:49.381 --> 21:51.898
- It is what you wanted, isn't it?
- Yeah.

21:52.213 --> 21:53.682
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course it is.

21:59.508 --> 22:00.727
Just think...

22:01.628 --> 22:03.462
I'll have to do
something else, you know,

22:04.155 --> 22:05.149
for me.

22:06.313 --> 22:07.693
Would you like a coffee?

22:07.706 --> 22:09.282
Yes, lovely, thanks!

22:10.117 --> 22:11.932
PHONE RINGS

22:12.181 --> 22:14.108
- Oh, sorry, I just need to get this, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:18.508 --> 22:19.716
Hello?

22:20.111 --> 22:21.736
Hi, yeah, this is Georgie.

22:24.665 --> 22:26.166
Oh, hi, Saira,

22:26.477 --> 22:27.760
thanks for getting back to me.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.791
Yeah, yeah, it'd be great to meet.

22:32.336 --> 22:33.508
Erm...

22:35.508 --> 22:38.120
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
that'll be possible.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.022
Right, I'm off.

23:36.142 --> 23:37.718
- See you later.
- See you.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.596
Elvis, I am going to see Saira.

24:08.111 --> 24:10.196
Yeah, I know she's already
been interviewed, but

24:10.432 --> 24:11.892
if I have five minutes to chat,

24:11.905 --> 24:13.637
we might find something of significance.

24:14.738 --> 24:16.891
Yeah. Yeah, at the university.

24:17.948 --> 24:19.428
Yeah, I'll be fine.

24:21.779 --> 24:22.948
With a vest.

24:25.419 --> 24:26.897
I'll be in control.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.996
This one means everything
to you, Abu Jaseer.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.868
So you won't fail.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.762
He was always on his own.

24:40.503 --> 24:42.687
Even in lectures, he'd sit apart and...

24:44.946 --> 24:46.988
I don't know, I guess
I felt sorry for him.

24:49.785 --> 24:51.742
Is that the reason why
you went out with him?

24:52.306 --> 24:53.456
Pity?

24:53.576 --> 24:54.694
No!

24:55.125 --> 24:56.478
Not really.

24:58.828 --> 25:01.131
I'd go and sit with him in the canteen.

25:01.486 --> 25:03.028
He'd stare at me.

25:03.148 --> 25:04.988
I sensed that he was grateful.

25:04.988 --> 25:06.906
We went out a couple of times,

25:07.026 --> 25:09.605
saw a film, went for a pizza.

25:10.308 --> 25:11.710
And before I knew it,

25:12.447 --> 25:14.125
we were sort of a couple.

25:16.434 --> 25:19.897
Then he said he wanted me
to take him to the mosque.

25:23.148 --> 25:25.855
Oh, God, I must sound like such a fool.

25:26.201 --> 25:27.444
If I was sitting where you are now,

25:27.475 --> 25:30.361
- that's exactly what I'd think.
- No. Not at all.

25:35.028 --> 25:36.029
I just...

25:36.841 --> 25:38.187
floated along.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.489
Then I sort of said that

25:41.111 --> 25:43.752
maybe he should chill
out with the mosque.

25:44.165 --> 25:45.668
And he just lost it with me,

25:45.857 --> 25:47.543
telling me I wasn't a good Muslim.

25:47.774 --> 25:49.567
Is that why you ended things with him?

25:50.188 --> 25:51.388
I tried.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.389
And he started blaming
all the other students

25:53.394 --> 25:54.792
for turning me against him.

25:55.548 --> 25:58.055
Did you hear anything of him
after he went to Ethiopia?

25:59.828 --> 26:02.801
He texted me from the
airport when he left.

26:04.308 --> 26:06.122
He said, "I'll see you again."

26:07.188 --> 26:09.216
- That's it?
- And my name.

26:10.748 --> 26:12.914
Well, he used to call me Saba.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.471
My initials, SA.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.430
And he'd joke that when I graduated

26:19.661 --> 26:22.431
I'd be SABA.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.362
So he'd call me Saba.

26:25.508 --> 26:28.198
So when that text came in...

26:29.308 --> 26:30.986
Well, he hadn't called me that in a

26:31.154 --> 26:32.495
really long time.

26:34.249 --> 26:35.958
I don't know. It was...

26:37.948 --> 26:40.349
It was like I had him back for a moment.

26:48.193 --> 26:50.391
It's been really good talking to you.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.357
Thanks for coming.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.177
Yeah. Me, too.

26:54.828 --> 26:56.574
At least when I graduate on Sunday,

26:56.592 --> 26:58.394
I can leave Manchester.

26:58.470 --> 27:02.092
So, that'll be the
first day of my new life.

27:02.148 --> 27:03.717
Yeah. Mine, too

27:03.966 --> 27:05.280
I'm getting married.

27:06.588 --> 27:08.588
BACKGROUND TELEVISION NOISE

27:14.375 --> 27:15.534
Hi.

27:16.388 --> 27:17.468
You OK?

27:17.468 --> 27:18.548
Shouldn't I be?

27:19.988 --> 27:20.988
Yes.

27:21.230 --> 27:22.625
That's OK, then.

27:23.446 --> 27:25.203
- [SHE SIGHS] Go on.
- What?

27:25.256 --> 27:26.255
You tell me.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.343
Well, how about you tell me
who you really just met up with?

27:32.049 --> 27:33.851
I told you, an old friend.

27:34.876 --> 27:36.781
Then you had to give
Close Protection the slip

27:36.803 --> 27:37.695
- to meet this old friend?
- Yes,

27:37.731 --> 27:39.386
because I didn't want the
palaver of me telling them

27:39.391 --> 27:40.589
where I'm going and who with.

27:40.611 --> 27:42.468
Yeah, maybe cos they
might know who he is.

27:42.681 --> 27:43.948
SHE GROANS

27:44.068 --> 27:46.211
When you going to stop
fucking lying to me, Georgie?

27:46.255 --> 27:47.828
- Hm?
- I promise you...

27:47.836 --> 27:49.795
All right, promise it wasn't Elvis,

27:49.828 --> 27:51.548
if that's what you're
thinking. I promise you.

27:59.948 --> 28:03.099
I had to see someone so I can
draw a line under everything.

28:03.152 --> 28:05.985
But... I promise, OK?

28:06.148 --> 28:08.165
I promise it wasn't Elvis.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.308
I went to see Abu's
girlfriend from university.

28:18.713 --> 28:20.720
Why? Why would you do
that without protection?

28:20.756 --> 28:21.914
Because...

28:21.945 --> 28:23.898
Maybe I need closure.

28:38.113 --> 28:39.828
PHONE VIBRATES

28:45.308 --> 28:47.223
- It's Captain James.
- Take it.

28:50.508 --> 28:51.588
Boss?

28:53.308 --> 28:54.413
Tomorrow?

28:54.830 --> 28:55.741
OK.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.684
All right.

28:58.617 --> 29:01.027
All right, I'll see you in the
morning, yeah? At the barracks.

29:01.548 --> 29:03.349
OK, bye. Bye.

29:09.919 --> 29:11.894
I want you to come in with me tomorrow.

29:13.508 --> 29:14.748
Why?

29:15.889 --> 29:18.308
Cos I want us to walk out together

29:18.605 --> 29:19.986
on my last day.

29:21.628 --> 29:22.788
New beginnings.

29:22.951 --> 29:24.131
Exactly.

29:33.085 --> 29:34.548
And I want a chauffeur.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.068
CHEERING AND SHOUTING

29:42.955 --> 29:44.179
Well done, lads.

29:44.788 --> 29:46.279
Well done!

29:46.708 --> 29:49.298
Lane, we just wanted to say goodbye...

29:49.418 --> 29:52.161
- and good riddance!
- Oh! Thank you.

29:53.915 --> 29:55.602
Just a little token of my esteem.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.858
Oh, Brains, thank you! Thank you.

29:58.068 --> 29:59.984
It's a mould of his
arse made in chocolate.

30:00.028 --> 30:01.468
THEY LAUGH

30:06.745 --> 30:08.446
- It was good to meet them.
- Yeah? Mm.

30:09.866 --> 30:11.127
So everything all right?

30:11.455 --> 30:13.324
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a bit sad.

30:13.348 --> 30:15.508
And happy at the same time,
if you know what I mean.

30:15.508 --> 30:16.747
George?

30:17.218 --> 30:18.564
Can I have a quick word?

30:18.948 --> 30:20.845
Er, yeah.

30:20.908 --> 30:21.951
Yeah, what is it?

30:22.348 --> 30:23.828
I just need to brief you on something.

30:23.828 --> 30:25.485
Well, DI Williams has
already briefed me.

30:25.511 --> 30:27.559
Yeah, well, this is classified, so...

30:30.468 --> 30:32.389
Well, you two crack on.
I'll wait in the car.

30:32.509 --> 30:33.778
Are you sure?

30:34.028 --> 30:35.496
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, OK.

30:47.353 --> 30:49.031
- What's classified?
- Don't marry him.

30:49.066 --> 30:50.767
- Shut up.
- It's too dangerous.

30:50.771 --> 30:52.489
Abu is out there somewhere.

30:55.184 --> 30:56.501
Don't marry him till you've
got your head straight,

30:56.511 --> 30:57.562
- at least.
- I'm fine.

30:58.188 --> 30:59.156
Do you have any new intel?

30:59.160 --> 31:00.390
Yeah, you're marrying the wrong bloke.

31:00.408 --> 31:01.864
What, and you're the
right one, I suppose?

31:10.023 --> 31:11.312
Look, we're going to get one chance

31:11.322 --> 31:12.814
and I'm not screwing it up this time.

31:13.045 --> 31:15.002
We need each other. Without
each other, we're useless.

31:15.030 --> 31:15.948
No, you are.

31:16.068 --> 31:17.333
For not turning up at our wedding day.

31:17.336 --> 31:19.493
- Now it's too fucking late.
- It's never too late.

31:24.014 --> 31:25.028
Bye, Elvis.

31:26.148 --> 31:27.512
Why would he have
pictures of you on his wall

31:27.516 --> 31:28.826
if he wasn't planning something?

31:33.092 --> 31:34.344
Do you love me?

31:34.828 --> 31:35.950
You know I do.

31:36.948 --> 31:39.498
- And you'd do anything for me?
- Yes.

31:40.469 --> 31:42.555
Find Abu and neutralise him.

31:50.513 --> 31:53.162
_

31:53.282 --> 31:54.748
What if they're onto me?

31:56.468 --> 31:57.910
Worked out my target?

31:58.948 --> 32:00.607
How can they have worked it out

32:01.200 --> 32:02.860
when it's only up there?

32:06.868 --> 32:09.014
CALM BACKGROUND CHATTER

32:12.305 --> 32:14.020
Nobody talks to each other.

32:14.053 --> 32:15.568
Astonishing, that is.

32:18.628 --> 32:20.348
CHATTER RISES

32:20.348 --> 32:21.778
Sh, sh!

32:23.264 --> 32:25.548
Quiet! Boys, behave.

32:25.668 --> 32:27.068
THEY CHEER

32:32.191 --> 32:33.473
I'm so sorry, they followed me here.

32:33.506 --> 32:35.082
Oh, don't be silly. They're
fine, they're not doing any harm.

32:35.099 --> 32:36.842
No, it's just an intimate
pre-wedding dinner.

32:36.875 --> 32:38.889
Er, I can get shot of them, if you want.

32:38.923 --> 32:39.944
- He's kidding.
- Yeah?

32:39.972 --> 32:41.952
- No, it's fine.
- No, it's fine, I'm joking.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.875
- It's weekend leave before Syria, so...
- Here we are, then.

32:43.919 --> 32:46.041
Here's a little something
to liven up the party!

32:46.228 --> 32:47.988
GUESTS GASP

32:47.988 --> 32:49.127
Pass them down, mate.

32:49.447 --> 32:50.654
Pass them down!

32:54.121 --> 32:55.164
Long day tomorrow.

32:55.182 --> 32:56.767
Anyway, guys. Let's get
these down our gullets

32:56.780 --> 32:58.298
and don't worry,
they're on Dangles' tab!

32:58.311 --> 32:59.708
Thank you, Dangles.

32:59.828 --> 33:01.982
Are you ready, everybody?
One, two, three.

33:04.827 --> 33:05.948
THEY GROAN

33:07.028 --> 33:08.872
I love that burning sensation!

33:11.028 --> 33:12.916
HE JIBES DRUNKENLY

33:14.115 --> 33:15.588
GLASS TINKLES

33:15.588 --> 33:17.586
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

33:17.586 --> 33:19.327
if I can have a bit of hush?

33:19.824 --> 33:22.028
- Dad, sit down!
- Unaccustomed as I am...

33:22.055 --> 33:24.058
I thought the speeches
were for tomorrow?

33:24.086 --> 33:25.868
Yeah, well, the proper speech
is tomorrow. But I've just... ..

33:25.899 --> 33:28.980
I've got that sorted,
it's moving and brilliant.

33:29.331 --> 33:31.382
I just wanted to say tonight,

33:31.868 --> 33:33.633
with the coming together
of the two families...

33:34.276 --> 33:35.858
God, that's the Tequila!

33:36.068 --> 33:37.314
No, seriously,

33:37.922 --> 33:39.968
life is full of ups and downs.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.428
Pigs and troughs.

33:43.036 --> 33:44.788
Our beloved daughter, Georgie,

33:44.788 --> 33:47.995
is marrying Faith and Gary's son, Jamie.

33:48.668 --> 33:49.855
Georgie...

33:51.089 --> 33:52.510
... is the most remarkable,

33:52.541 --> 33:53.508
brave,

33:53.886 --> 33:56.398
beautiful woman

33:57.028 --> 33:58.508
any of us will ever meet.

34:00.184 --> 34:01.570
I mean, what she's done,

34:02.068 --> 34:03.501
most of us would've crumbled.

34:04.939 --> 34:06.191
I know I would.

34:08.850 --> 34:10.262
And now I look at her.

34:11.428 --> 34:12.686
Proud dad, I know. But...

34:12.996 --> 34:14.032
Sorry!

34:15.052 --> 34:16.668
Dad, please.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.487
Hey, how often am I going to
get a chance to say in public

34:20.433 --> 34:21.915
how proud of you I am?

34:25.148 --> 34:26.554
How much I love you and how

34:26.754 --> 34:29.204
it broke my heart when I thought
of you in that cage with...

34:35.357 --> 34:36.609
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

34:38.623 --> 34:40.324
And I would have swapped
places in a heartbeat

34:40.351 --> 34:42.105
if I could've done,
cos you don't deserve...

34:43.166 --> 34:44.174
that.

34:47.228 --> 34:48.788
You only deserve love.

34:52.987 --> 34:54.960
And how lucky are we all, eh?

34:55.268 --> 34:56.523
She's back!

34:57.744 --> 34:58.969
Home.

34:59.533 --> 35:00.864
And you've got us to look after you

35:00.877 --> 35:02.174
and take care of you for evermore.

35:02.188 --> 35:03.523
With Jamie's help, Dad.

35:04.864 --> 35:06.187
Look after her, lad.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.632
I will do, sir.

35:09.068 --> 35:11.412
Right, well, that's me done. Cheers.

35:16.846 --> 35:19.172
Oh, caught me unawares there.

35:19.212 --> 35:22.745
I've not cried since February
when I got that big gas bill.

35:22.828 --> 35:24.308
THEY LAUGH

35:26.108 --> 35:27.402
I can't believe you're leaving me

35:27.424 --> 35:28.868
to manage my parents alone tonight.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.925
You can't see me before
the wedding. It's tradition.

35:31.970 --> 35:33.350
Well, I'll just have to
see you at the altar, then.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.507
Well, I'll be the babe in the
veil hurtling down the aisle.

35:35.627 --> 35:37.141
And I'll be the cool dude in the corner

35:37.203 --> 35:39.308
pretending not to be
massively over excited.

35:40.373 --> 35:41.868
TELEVISION: The hunt continues for a man

35:41.878 --> 35:44.268

35:44.388 --> 35:46.348
Jason Raynott, who's 21,

35:46.361 --> 35:48.708
is thought to be in the
Greater Manchester area.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.915
Police say that, if spotted,
Raynott shouldn't be approached.

35:51.990 --> 35:54.121
Anyone who thinks they
know of his whereabouts

35:54.139 --> 35:56.185
should contact police immediately.

- SHE SCREAMS

37:44.023 --> 37:46.426
Hey. Are you all right?

37:46.498 --> 37:49.090
- What happened?
- Dad, I'm sorry, I just...

37:49.128 --> 37:51.259
- Bad dream?
- Yeah.

37:52.628 --> 37:53.857
Oh,

37:54.040 --> 37:56.543
- just ignore me.
- Hey. Don't be daft.

37:57.703 --> 37:59.751
Yeah, but I am daft, aren't I?

38:00.511 --> 38:02.108
You should know me by now!

38:02.137 --> 38:03.663
Georgie.

38:04.223 --> 38:05.468
He'll be there.

38:07.031 --> 38:08.446
I guarantee it.

38:08.907 --> 38:10.444
He's a good lad.

38:10.998 --> 38:13.268
Now, you're bound to be worried,
after what happened last time.

38:13.657 --> 38:15.577
That's understandable.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.668
Jamie's mad for you.

38:17.668 --> 38:20.188
He's properly madly in love with you.

38:22.037 --> 38:23.536
I've never seen anybody dote on someone

38:23.558 --> 38:25.068
the way he looks at you.

38:29.388 --> 38:31.468
Is everything going
to be all right, Dad?

38:31.468 --> 38:33.092
Course it's going to be all right.

38:33.103 --> 38:35.356
It's going to be more than all right.

38:35.927 --> 38:37.497
It's going to be brilliant.

- OK. Love you.

38:56.644 --> 38:57.912
Love you.

39:10.388 --> 39:12.771
I know, have a good time.

OK. Hello, people.

- All right. How are you?

40:31.912 --> 40:33.566
Is there a panto round here?

ready for their entrance.

40:36.114 --> 40:37.908
Oh, shut up. You look beautiful.

40:39.908 --> 40:41.025
You all right?

40:41.058 --> 40:42.723
Yeah, I'm just having a dizzy spell.

40:43.308 --> 40:44.708
Aren't you supposed to, like,

40:44.708 --> 40:46.385
put your head between
your legs or something?

40:46.390 --> 40:47.628
Yeah.

Well.

41:34.529 --> 41:35.844
Listen, they've moved
me from Old Trafford

41:35.850 --> 41:37.370
to work with Close Protection on you.

41:37.426 --> 41:38.907
- Who has?
- I have.

41:39.118 --> 41:40.494
Just to be safe.

41:41.588 --> 41:43.285
You promised me you'd catch him.

41:43.474 --> 41:45.566
- Yeah, and I'm keeping that promise.
- Oi!

41:46.028 --> 41:47.741
- What the hell? You,
- Dad.

41:47.774 --> 41:49.988
- gone, now! Now!
- Dad, wait. Dad,

41:50.005 --> 41:52.548
- it's all right. It's all right.
- No, it's not all right. It's all wrong. Clear off.

41:52.563 --> 41:54.212
Listen, I'm working
Close Protection now, Max.

41:54.234 --> 41:55.291
I don't care who you're working with.

41:55.296 --> 41:57.103
I don't want you
anywhere near my family.

41:57.125 --> 41:58.395
Dad, please. Just one minute.

41:58.413 --> 42:00.162
- It's your wedding day!
- I know, please.

42:00.761 --> 42:01.773
Please.

42:01.988 --> 42:03.008
One minute.

42:03.292 --> 42:04.211
One!

42:04.788 --> 42:06.555
Then I never want to see his face again.

42:11.308 --> 42:13.388
You're determined to fuck
this up for me, aren't you?

42:13.431 --> 42:15.798
What, because I think your
wedding day's a credible target?

42:16.708 --> 42:18.821
Think about it, George. The
first day of your new life.

42:18.828 --> 42:20.575
You don't think he'd want to ruin that?

Georgie?

42:47.671 --> 42:50.663

42:52.428 --> 42:54.468
Do we have a presence at
the graduation ceremony?

42:54.588 --> 42:56.028
What graduation ceremony?

42:56.028 --> 42:57.708
It Saira's graduation today.

42:57.828 --> 42:58.737
So?

42:58.857 --> 43:00.868
So it is a revenge attack,

43:00.903 --> 43:02.271
and it is fucking personal.

43:03.308 --> 43:04.579
It's not me.

43:05.428 --> 43:06.524
It's her!

43:11.588 --> 43:12.646
Bloody hell.

43:12.664 --> 43:14.702
- What the hell's going on, Georgie?
- Dad, please.

43:15.177 --> 43:16.087
No!

43:16.677 --> 43:17.685
Dad!

43:20.308 --> 43:22.188
THEY TALK INDISTINCTLY

43:30.195 --> 43:32.153
Right, that's it. Me,
you. Right here, right now.

43:32.167 --> 43:33.374
- Let's sort this once and for all.
- What are you doing, Max?

43:33.388 --> 43:35.423
- You're making a scene, calm down.
- It's her wedding day, for God's sake, Elvis.

43:35.448 --> 43:36.656
Just go, please?

43:36.936 --> 43:38.193
You are not going!

43:39.010 --> 43:41.091
- Come on! You don't wanna do this.
- Dad, we've got to go somewhere.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.019
Stop! You're running away with that?!

43:49.879 --> 43:50.845
Epic.

43:52.508 --> 43:54.243
We need backup at the
university right now.

43:54.252 --> 43:55.287
We are en route.

43:56.705 --> 43:58.628
First response heading there now.

44:09.782 --> 44:11.131
It's here on the left.

45:01.296 --> 45:02.567

I will blow this place up!

Allahu akbar!

46:55.433 --> 46:57.475
Abu, Abu, let her go.

46:57.547 --> 46:58.946
Jason, please.

46:59.001 --> 47:00.966
You think this is about
you?! It's not about you,

47:00.988 --> 47:02.625
it's about God!

47:03.208 --> 47:04.512
It's fucking typical

47:04.523 --> 47:06.793
you and your fucking
privilege thinking it is!

47:06.913 --> 47:07.902

47:08.818 --> 47:09.961
Let her go...

47:10.161 --> 47:11.599
Inshallah.

47:12.215 --> 47:14.495
I am being a good Muslim
by blowing up the kafir.

47:14.551 --> 47:16.515
I took you to the mosque...

47:16.703 --> 47:18.407
I was always there for you.

47:18.751 --> 47:20.155
They wouldn't want you to do this,

47:20.166 --> 47:21.797
you know that, don't you, Jason?

47:22.302 --> 47:23.429
Ja...

47:23.549 --> 47:25.404
I'm not Jason any more.

47:26.775 --> 47:28.290

Elvis got shot.

51:04.046 --> 51:05.669
He's in the hospital.

51:08.685 --> 51:11.340
Maybe I could finish
him off on my next shift.

51:21.879 --> 51:24.004
It's not him, though, is it?

51:30.548 --> 51:33.327
No-one turned my head, Jamie.

51:38.722 --> 51:41.235
I'm just not the settling down type.

51:43.188 --> 51:47.308
- I'm sorry, I really want to, but I...
- You just can't seem to manage it?

51:49.125 --> 51:50.811
Yeah.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.628
Georgie.

53:08.857 --> 53:10.828
You're about to be court-martialled.

53:24.628 --> 53:26.670
Oh. Oh, come here, love.

53:29.868 --> 53:32.708
It's all right, darling. It's all right.

53:33.384 --> 53:34.788
You all right?

53:34.965 --> 53:37.028
Ohhh, bet you hate me.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.821
What are you talking about?

53:40.628 --> 53:43.148
We love you so much, Georgie.

53:43.844 --> 53:46.519
Well, I mean, we're
getting used to this...

53:47.429 --> 53:49.110
it's not like it's
the first time, is it?

53:55.642 --> 53:57.873
I didn't plan for this to happen.

53:59.068 --> 54:00.558
When I woke up this morning,

54:00.575 --> 54:02.612
I thought I'd be a married woman by now.

54:03.034 --> 54:05.148
Maybe it's not for everyone.

54:09.283 --> 54:10.988
Maybe not, no.

54:13.468 --> 54:15.514
So what will you do now, Georgie?

54:18.732 --> 54:21.748
I guess you're heading off to Syria?

54:24.975 --> 54:26.801
Come here.

54:28.731 --> 54:30.124
Hey.

55:13.748 --> 55:15.765

- Hi.

55:18.005 --> 55:19.948
Hi!

55:22.748 --> 55:25.608
- It is so good to see you, Nafula.
- And you.

55:25.615 --> 55:27.390
I wasn't sure if I'd see you again.

55:27.428 --> 55:29.228
Well, I fancied coming
back for my honeymoon.

55:29.348 --> 55:31.776
- Just without a husband?
- They're overrated!

55:31.896 --> 55:33.662
And you don't have one?

55:33.720 --> 55:35.642
I've got something much more important,

55:35.859 --> 55:38.243
- a job to do.
- With the army?
