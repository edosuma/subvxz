00:02.017 --> 00:05.321
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.321 --> 00:08.658
Guinness stout and a gin and tonic.

00:08.658 --> 00:10.410
Something the matter, Carla?

00:10.410 --> 00:12.195
Yeah, something's the matter.

00:12.195 --> 00:13.697
My life is the pits.

00:13.697 --> 00:15.115
Seems like good things happen

00:15.615 --> 00:17.367
to everybody except me, you know?

00:17.367 --> 00:18.668
Norm has a new job.

00:18.668 --> 00:21.171
Frasier actually seems happy

00:21.171 --> 00:23.673
since he met his creepy girlfriend.

00:23.673 --> 00:28.678
And Sam has given up women
and decided to marry Diane.

00:28.678 --> 00:30.547
And what have I got? Zip.

00:30.547 --> 00:32.515
Woody, I mean, how do you keep

00:32.515 --> 00:34.517
such a sunny disposition

00:34.517 --> 00:37.020
in this rotten, stink-infested world?

00:37.020 --> 00:38.521
You mean, what do I do

00:38.521 --> 00:41.524
when I see Mr. Blues
peeking around the corner?

00:41.524 --> 00:42.525
Oh, God,

00:42.525 --> 00:47.030
he even has a cute name for depression.

00:47.030 --> 00:51.034
Well, I just close my eyes,
and I think a happy thought.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.902
Here, I-I'll show you.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.545 --> 01:04.414
What was your thought?

01:04.414 --> 01:06.082
I'm glad I'm not you.

01:11.254 --> 01:15.058
(piano plays)

01:15.058 --> 01:17.427
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:17.427 --> 01:19.929
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:19.929 --> 01:22.432
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:22.432 --> 01:25.935
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:25.935 --> 01:29.439
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:31.825 --> 01:34.744
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:34.744 --> 01:39.749
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:39.749 --> 01:44.754
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:44.754 --> 01:46.756
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:46.756 --> 01:49.759
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:49.759 --> 01:54.264
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:54.264 --> 01:56.766
? You want to go where people know ?

01:56.766 --> 01:59.769
? People are all the same ?

01:59.769 --> 02:03.273
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:21.524 --> 02:23.526
Hey, Mr. Peterson. Yeah.

02:23.526 --> 02:26.029
I'm working on this month's
issue of the Cheers newsletter,

02:26.029 --> 02:27.280
and I wondered

02:27.280 --> 02:29.566
what's new with you?

02:29.566 --> 02:31.484
Nothing, really, Woody.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.286
Well, you sure?

02:33.286 --> 02:35.038
Uh, I don't know. Check last month.

02:35.038 --> 02:36.039
What was I up to then?

02:37.540 --> 02:39.409
Let's see. Norm Peterson.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.743
Nothing.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.162
Oh.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.664
Well, I guess it's not new then, eh?

02:44.664 --> 02:47.667
How about you, Dr. Crane?

02:47.667 --> 02:48.918
What's new in my life?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.720
Well, it's not easily
put into words, Wood.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.222
Perhaps it has something to do

02:52.222 --> 02:53.723
with my relationship with Lilith.

02:53.723 --> 02:55.592
And perhaps it's just a maturity

02:55.592 --> 02:57.560
that comes with age.

02:57.560 --> 03:01.564
All I know is that I feel
I finally know who I am,

03:01.564 --> 03:04.067
and I'm happy with that person.

03:04.067 --> 03:05.435
Does that answer your question?

03:05.435 --> 03:06.236
Sure does.

03:06.236 --> 03:08.488
Dr. Crane: Nothing.

03:11.991 --> 03:12.992
Sam!

03:12.992 --> 03:14.327
Great news!

03:14.327 --> 03:15.612
I found a house.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.613
Hey!

03:16.613 --> 03:19.582
Turn it in. Maybe you'll get a reward.

03:19.582 --> 03:20.583
No, you goose.

03:21.084 --> 03:23.086
I found our house.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.587
I was driving to work today

03:24.587 --> 03:27.590
and, as luck would have it,
there was an eight-car smash-up.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.212
Yeah, that didn't come out right.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.630
What I meant was I was forced to take

03:33.630 --> 03:35.131
an alternate route,

03:35.131 --> 03:38.518
and it sent me right
past the perfect house.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.520
Oh, Sam, you should see it.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.355
Three bedrooms, two and a half baths,

03:42.355 --> 03:43.856
a formal dining room,

03:43.856 --> 03:45.858
a huge fireplace in the living room.

03:45.858 --> 03:46.859
Excuse me for interrupting,

03:47.360 --> 03:48.728
but we're not looking for a house.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.697
I know. I already found it.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.699
No, I mean that we agreed

03:52.699 --> 03:55.702
to live in my apartment
for a year first.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.204
Well, yes,

03:58.204 --> 04:00.073
that was the original plan. Yeah.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.409
But that was before
I saw hardwood floors,

04:03.409 --> 04:06.212
bay windows, crown moldings.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.213
Yeah, well,

04:07.213 --> 04:09.082
so what's wrong with my apartment?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.384
Well, granted this house

04:11.384 --> 04:14.887
doesn't have your view of
the Exotic Dancing Academy.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.225
But I think you could learn to live

04:19.225 --> 04:20.726
in the shade of a stately elm.

04:20.726 --> 04:24.480
Oh, uh, I, uh, hate
to be a buttinsky here,

04:24.480 --> 04:26.566
but, uh,

04:26.566 --> 04:28.601
this is the absolute
worst time to buy a house.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.435
Why is that?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.436
Ah, seller's market.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.938
Unless you run into
that, uh, rare breed,

04:31.938 --> 04:33.323
you know, the motivated seller.

04:33.323 --> 04:34.607
Now, you know, for a price,

04:34.607 --> 04:36.526
I could put you in a sweet little, uh,

04:36.526 --> 04:37.527
three-bed,
two-bath number.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.030
Uh, it's got, uh,
fishnetting over the patio

04:41.030 --> 04:44.534
and a handmade, uh, uh, lava
rock fire pit in the back.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.836
Cliffie, uh, that sounds a
little bit like your house.

04:46.836 --> 04:48.204
It is my house, Norm.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.589
NORM: Wait, wait, wait now.

04:49.589 --> 04:50.873
You said your mother
was going to live there

04:50.873 --> 04:52.125
till the day she died.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.961
Well, uh, she's clean,
and she doesn't eat much.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.463
Sam, please.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.465
Just come with me and take a look at it.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.467
I'm not-I'm not ready to own a home.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.469
It's a... you-you got
to work up to that.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.854
Sammy's right.

05:04.854 --> 05:06.105
It's a big responsibility.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.607
You got uh, lawns to mow.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.058
You got plumbing to fix.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.310
You got gutters to clean.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.611
Then, you know, every couple of years,

05:11.611 --> 05:13.613
you got to paint the entire
thing from top to bottom.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.982
Honestly, I don't know where
Vera gets the energy sometimes.

05:18.201 --> 05:20.536
Norm, you should be ashamed of yourself.

05:20.536 --> 05:22.538
Yeah, I guess I should, shouldn't I?

05:22.538 --> 05:25.541
You know, thank God I'm not, huh?

05:25.541 --> 05:27.960
Well, Sam and I will split
the chores at our house.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.961
Would you just slow down?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.963
We're not buyin' a house. I mean it.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.832
Now, Sam, don't be so hasty.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.167
This could be the house for you.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.551
Does it have a basement?

05:35.551 --> 05:36.469
Yes, it does. A large one.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.837
Great.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.723
You can convert it into a
dungeon to keep Diane in.

05:40.723 --> 05:43.176
Then, when you're done torturing her,

05:43.176 --> 05:46.679
you could bury the body
under the cement floor,

05:46.679 --> 05:48.681
cover it with a Ping-Pong table.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.067
Well, maybe. I don't know.

05:51.067 --> 05:51.851
Sam.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.237
No, no, maybe you, not her.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.157
Will you stop stalling
and come with me, please?

05:58.157 --> 06:00.159
Just give me one good
reason why I should.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.613
Because we own it.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.615
That's a pretty good reason, Sam.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.120
You bought a house without asking me?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.623
Well, I-I didn't exactly buy it.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.626
Uh-huh. I put down the teeniest

06:16.626 --> 06:18.511
of refundable deposits.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.712
You know, I don't believe this.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.681
Oh, now, Sam, there was
another couple there,

06:21.681 --> 06:23.683
and they were all ready
to make a bid on it.

06:23.683 --> 06:24.550
I had to move quickly.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.018
Yeah, talking about moving quickly,

06:26.018 --> 06:27.019
you get into my office right now

06:27.019 --> 06:29.021
and you call them tell them
that I want my deposit back.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.023
Okay, Sam, whatever you say.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.525
But first I want to call the decorator

06:32.525 --> 06:33.526
about ordering drapes.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.895
Yeah, well, make it quick.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.363
Well, I guess it's
time we started thinking

06:37.363 --> 06:38.364
about a housewarming gift.

06:38.865 --> 06:39.866
Ah, it's pathetic.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.367
Yeah, you'd never catch a woman of mine

06:41.367 --> 06:42.869
leading me around by the nose.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.872
No, but you might catch her
sunning herself on a rock.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.391
It's ours.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.895
It's finally ours. I can't believe it.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.897
Neither can I.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.899
Wow, you know, every time I come here

07:12.899 --> 07:14.400
I like this place more and more.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.402
Oh. (chuckles)

07:16.402 --> 07:19.405
Thank God you talked
me into this. Oh, yeah.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.407
Oh.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.326
You don't think we spent
too much money on it?

07:23.326 --> 07:24.827
Oh, absolutely.

07:24.827 --> 07:26.829
What the hell?

07:26.829 --> 07:27.830
It's a great house.

07:27.830 --> 07:28.831
Yeah. And it's ours.

07:28.831 --> 07:30.333
Well, not quite yet.

07:30.333 --> 07:31.701
You know, I never feel at home

07:31.701 --> 07:34.670
until I hang this little baby up.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.672
Oh, God, Sam.

07:36.672 --> 07:37.673
What?

07:37.673 --> 07:40.176
Oh, not where people can see it.

07:40.176 --> 07:41.677
You know, I have never understood

07:41.677 --> 07:43.179
your attitude about this painting.

07:43.179 --> 07:44.430
I mean, it's a classic.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.265
"Dogs Playing

07:46.265 --> 07:47.767
Blackjack."

07:52.271 --> 07:55.274
(laughing)

07:56.275 --> 07:59.278
I never look at this
without cracking up.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.146
Ah.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.115
Well, that's the purpose of great art.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.116
You know something? I think you,

08:04.116 --> 08:06.118
you're missing the subtle humor here.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.120
I mean, see this guy
right here? He's cheating.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.121
(laughs)

08:10.623 --> 08:12.124
Oh. Oh, Sam,

08:12.625 --> 08:14.627
I can hardly wait till
I'm in the kitchen,

08:14.627 --> 08:17.630
pot holders in hand,
cooking a nice big roast,

08:17.630 --> 08:19.999
calling out to you,
"Dinner's ready, honey."

08:19.999 --> 08:22.335
"I'll be right there.
I'm in the workshop."

08:22.335 --> 08:24.337
The workshop?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.506
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.757
My dad always had one.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.259
I used to go down there all the time.

08:30.259 --> 08:33.145
I just loved the smell of sawdust.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.398
Wonder where I can buy some of that.

08:35.398 --> 08:36.899
(laughs)

08:36.899 --> 08:38.267
Oh, Sam,

08:38.267 --> 08:39.652
I have wonderful plans

08:39.652 --> 08:40.653
for every room in the entire house.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.154
That's funny, so do I.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.655
(laughs)

08:43.655 --> 08:46.659
Why don't we start right
here in the living room?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.160
Yeah, these floors
look like they could use

08:48.160 --> 08:50.663
a little polishing. Oh, Sam. Sam.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.165
MAN: We really have
to leave now, my dear.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.668
WOMAN: Yes, I guess you're right.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.170
Uh, hello? Hello?

08:58.170 --> 09:01.173
Oh. You must be the new owner.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.174
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,

09:02.174 --> 09:03.676
I'm Sam Malone. How do you do?

09:03.676 --> 09:04.677
How are you?

09:04.677 --> 09:06.629
This is my, uh, fiancée, Diane Chambers.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.631
Hi. Bert and Lillian Miller.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.632
Oh. Hi, how are you?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.134
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, it's a pleasure.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.020
The house is beautiful. Mmm.

09:14.020 --> 09:14.804
Oh, yes, yes.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.305
Well, of course, we know

09:16.305 --> 09:18.307
we're supposed to be out of here by now,

09:18.307 --> 09:21.310
but, well, we forgot a few
odds and ends, you know?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.695
And, uh,

09:22.695 --> 09:25.648
well, we just wanted
to take a last look.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.149
Well, you know,

09:27.149 --> 09:29.535
when you've lived in
a house for 40 years,

09:29.535 --> 09:31.537
taking that last step out the door,

09:31.537 --> 09:33.039
well, it-it-it's
pretty hard.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.540
Of course.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.544
I confess, I... touched
liquor this morning.

09:41.047 --> 09:45.051
Oh, tha... that's all right, my girl.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.053
But you look like a fine couple.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.056
I'm glad the house is
going to you. Thank you.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.058
Oh, yeah, yeah, we plan
to do great things in it--

09:52.058 --> 09:54.927
with it, with it.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.896
So many memories.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.898
Like when Mikey climbed
up the bookshelves

09:58.898 --> 09:59.899
and hit his head on the mantle.

09:59.899 --> 10:00.900
You remember?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.903
Oh, we were all so worried.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.404
And that's where little Janey

10:05.404 --> 10:07.406
rehearsed her dance for the school play.

10:07.406 --> 10:08.407
Oh.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.410
You know, I studied ballet as a child.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.912
So I became quite experien...

10:12.912 --> 10:14.413
Berty Junior

10:14.413 --> 10:16.198
took his first steps

10:16.198 --> 10:18.000
on this very spot right here.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.003
And... that's where we
always put our Christmas tree.

10:21.003 --> 10:22.371
LILLIAN: Every year.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.373
40 Christmases.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.875
Thirty-nine.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.376
Hmm?

10:27.376 --> 10:28.878
Well, we didn't quite make it

10:28.878 --> 10:30.379
to Christmas this year.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.881
Oh, sure.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.132
BERT: You know,

10:33.132 --> 10:34.433
I think we'll

10:34.433 --> 10:36.936
miss the Christmases most of all.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.437
I know, Bert.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.939
The children

10:39.939 --> 10:42.308
and the grandchildren.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.310
BERT: Ah, never mind.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.611
There, there now.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.613
Out with the old.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.115
And in with the new.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.117
Now, we're just going
to get out of your way,

10:51.117 --> 10:52.485
so that you two can

10:52.485 --> 10:53.953
share your lives.

10:53.953 --> 10:54.954
Well, good luck to you. Thank you.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.706
Can I help you with those boxes there?

10:56.706 --> 10:57.540
Oh no, they'll be fine. No.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.041
We're just going as far as the bus stop.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.409
Okay, okay.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.877
Have a nice day.

11:01.877 --> 11:03.129
SAM: Yeah. Glad to meet you. Thank you.

11:03.129 --> 11:03.963
Good-bye.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.331
Good-bye.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.169
(weepy): Good-bye, house.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.170
SAM: Bye-bye.

11:11.170 --> 11:11.671
BERT: Bye-bye now.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.591
Gee, what a sweet couple, huh?

11:17.593 --> 11:18.594
Let's see, where were we?

11:18.594 --> 11:19.595
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I think we were, uh,

11:19.595 --> 11:21.097
talking about polishing the floor.

11:21.097 --> 11:25.601
Do want to wax or shall we buff?

11:25.601 --> 11:29.105
I cannot live a single
day in this house.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.610
Oh, God.

11:39.331 --> 11:41.083
SAM: Come on, come on.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.085
It's all right.

11:43.085 --> 11:45.087
I mean it, Sam.

11:45.087 --> 11:47.089
I could never live here.

11:47.089 --> 11:49.091
No, don't say that. Don't say that.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.093
Listen, hey, I got a surprise for you.

11:51.093 --> 11:53.596
Look, I took the picture down.

11:53.596 --> 11:56.098
Sam, it has nothing
to do with the picture.

11:56.098 --> 11:59.101
I-I... Although I do appreciate that.

11:59.101 --> 12:00.603
This place belongs

12:00.603 --> 12:02.605
to Bert and Lillian.

12:02.605 --> 12:04.607
It's alive with their memories.

12:05.608 --> 12:10.112
Oh, poor Mikey. Now,
that must have smarted.

12:10.112 --> 12:12.615
Come on, come on, we love this house.

12:12.615 --> 12:15.117
Now, I know how you
feel right now, but...

12:15.117 --> 12:17.119
but wait till we make some changes here.

12:17.119 --> 12:18.621
Look, we can... we can...

12:18.621 --> 12:19.622
we can knock out this wall right here

12:19.622 --> 12:21.123
and make the whole room different.

12:21.123 --> 12:22.625
I mean, yeah, what
the hell? Look at that.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.627
They got writing all over this wall.

12:24.627 --> 12:26.629
Oh, look.

12:26.629 --> 12:29.131
"Mikey at one year, 30 inches."

12:29.131 --> 12:33.385
"Bert Jr. at two years, 36 inches."

12:33.385 --> 12:36.605
How can you possibly
think of tearing this down?

12:36.605 --> 12:38.107
Can't you see

12:38.107 --> 12:40.276
this is a record of their lives?

12:40.276 --> 12:41.193
Well, all I can see

12:41.193 --> 12:44.196
is that little Janey here was a moose.

12:47.450 --> 12:51.620
How'd you like to have that
coming at you in a tutu, huh?

12:51.620 --> 12:55.875
You have the sensitivity
of a dung beetle.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.743
I'm just trying to
lighten the mood up here.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.629
Well, I'm not in the
mood for fun and games.

13:00.629 --> 13:03.382
Well... ALL: Happy housewarming!

13:03.382 --> 13:05.384
Hey, hey...

13:05.384 --> 13:06.385
No, don't.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.888
This isn't our house.
We don't belong in it.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.639
I'll never live here.

13:10.639 --> 13:12.308
Not one day, not one minute.

13:12.308 --> 13:13.809
Please, leave, please.

13:18.314 --> 13:21.317
You know, Sammy, a couple of years ago,

13:21.317 --> 13:22.318
this might've taken me by surprise,

13:22.818 --> 13:25.321
but now I just kind of roll with it.

13:26.822 --> 13:29.325
This is great!

13:29.325 --> 13:31.827
I got the one where
they're on the train.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.830
Yeah. Not now, Woody.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.833
(laughs)

13:37.833 --> 13:38.834
Look at that.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.336
I never noticed that.

13:40.336 --> 13:41.837
The bloodhound's doubling down.

13:41.837 --> 13:42.838
Look at that.

13:43.839 --> 13:46.759
(horn honks)

13:47.760 --> 13:49.762
Uh, I'm sorry about this, you guys.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.764
It's a... it's a bad time.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.266
CARLA: Wait till the honeymoon!

14:00.272 --> 14:02.775
We're trespassers here, Sam.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.277
The love and warmth
that fill these walls

14:05.277 --> 14:06.278
didn't come from us.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.780
We can change the wallpaper,

14:07.780 --> 14:08.781
we can paint,

14:09.281 --> 14:11.283
we can put up new curtains,

14:11.283 --> 14:12.785
but the soul of this house

14:12.785 --> 14:14.787
will still be those
two sweet, old people.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.289
I'd be afraid to wash the dishes

14:17.289 --> 14:18.791
for fear I'd turn the faucet on,

14:19.291 --> 14:22.294
and instead of water coming
out, it would be Lillian's tears.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.797
Oh, brother.

14:25.297 --> 14:29.301
I-I-I'll put
a purifier in.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.806
All houses have ghosts.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.808
You know, memories of people
who lived there before.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.726
Now, the only way you
can get rid of them

14:37.726 --> 14:40.229
is to-to start making
your own memories,

14:40.229 --> 14:41.730
and the only way we can do that

14:41.730 --> 14:45.734
is if we move in here
and start living here.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.736
Mm...

14:47.736 --> 14:48.737
maybe you're right.

14:48.737 --> 14:51.240
Yeah.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.742
I guess I've been overreacting.

14:53.742 --> 14:54.743
Oh, that's okay.

14:54.743 --> 14:56.245
(sighs)

14:56.245 --> 14:58.747
What do you say we carry
on this conversation naked?

15:00.749 --> 15:05.170
Do you think I could ever
make love in this house?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.344
Afternoon, everybody.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.712
EVERYONE: Norm!

15:13.712 --> 15:15.681
Hey, Mr. Peterson, how's life?

15:15.681 --> 15:16.682
Oh, the plot's okay, Woody,

15:16.682 --> 15:18.934
but it kind of falls apart at the end.

15:20.519 --> 15:21.303
Where's Sammy and Diane?

15:21.303 --> 15:23.305
They're in the office trying to unload

15:23.305 --> 15:24.807
The Nightmare on Diane Street.

15:24.807 --> 15:26.058
Well...

15:26.058 --> 15:27.359
they'll just have to miss my big news.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.228
Woody, I want you

15:29.228 --> 15:31.530
to stop the presses on
that, uh, newsletter.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.781
You'll never guess who I saw

15:32.781 --> 15:34.283
in front of my office today.

15:34.283 --> 15:35.651
Robert Urich.

15:35.651 --> 15:36.785
(gasps) Okay?

15:36.785 --> 15:38.621
I want to tell you
he's just as nice a guy

15:38.621 --> 15:40.122
driving past at 50 miles an hour

15:40.122 --> 15:41.490
as he looks on that TV screen.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.126
Hey, Woody, Woody, Woody.

15:44.126 --> 15:45.494
Another round. Quick, too.

15:45.494 --> 15:46.495
Hey, how's it going in there? Oh, great.

15:46.495 --> 15:47.379
The couple in there are crazier

15:47.379 --> 15:48.747
about the house than we were.

15:48.747 --> 15:49.498
You know, I have to admit,

15:49.498 --> 15:50.499
I was a little ticked off

15:51.000 --> 15:52.501
when Diane said she
wanted to sell the house,

15:52.501 --> 15:55.504
but as it turns out, I
think we're going to make a--

15:55.504 --> 15:56.505
that's
good, Woody--

15:56.505 --> 15:58.007
make a nice little profit here.

15:59.008 --> 16:01.010
Are you sure I can't change your mind?

16:01.510 --> 16:02.511
I'm sorry.

16:02.511 --> 16:05.431
That's my final decision.

16:11.820 --> 16:14.106
You know, I-I-I'm
getting on in years,

16:14.106 --> 16:17.109
and my hearing may not
be what it used to be,

16:17.109 --> 16:19.495
but did you just queer this whole deal?

16:19.495 --> 16:21.113
I had to turn them down.

16:21.113 --> 16:21.947
Why?

16:21.947 --> 16:22.748
Sam, those people

16:22.748 --> 16:24.249
were bereft of soul.

16:24.249 --> 16:25.751
They had no intention

16:25.751 --> 16:27.202
of embracing that house.

16:27.202 --> 16:29.455
Their only desire was to live there.

16:31.757 --> 16:34.259
They wanted to live in
the house they just bought?

16:34.259 --> 16:37.763
My God, they must've
been raised by wolves.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.215
They weren't the right kind of people

16:40.215 --> 16:42.217
to live in Bert and Lillian's house.

16:42.217 --> 16:43.218
Oh, you know...

16:43.218 --> 16:44.603
That's it, that's it.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.605
You know, I... we have
always done things your way.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.607
I have bent over backwards
to make you happy.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.109
I bought the ring you wanted,

16:50.109 --> 16:52.611
the china you wanted,
the-the crystal you wanted.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.613
I even agreed to have
a duvet cover on my bed,

16:54.613 --> 16:56.115
and I don't know what a duvet is

16:56.115 --> 16:57.983
or what it's supposed to cover.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.651
When are we going to do something

16:59.651 --> 17:01.537
that I want to do?

17:01.537 --> 17:03.038
May I remind you that we're going

17:03.038 --> 17:05.790
to Disney World for our honeymoon?

17:06.625 --> 17:09.127
Big deal. Who isn't?

17:11.413 --> 17:14.299
Sam, every time I look at that place,

17:14.299 --> 17:17.803
I can't help but think
about that poor, old couple,

17:17.803 --> 17:19.805
shambling away from their house,

17:19.805 --> 17:21.306
wishing they could spend

17:21.306 --> 17:24.675
one last Christmas
there with their family.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.178
Well, then why not just give them

17:26.178 --> 17:27.930
one last Christmas there,
if that's what they want?

17:27.930 --> 17:29.098
But rid yourself

17:29.098 --> 17:31.066
of the guilt you feel by robbing them

17:31.066 --> 17:32.818
of the last few happy
memories left them.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.653
Oh, you know, that-that's
the screwiest idea

17:34.653 --> 17:37.523
I've ever heard. No, Sam, he's right.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.776
We-we'll-we'll call the
Millers and all their children,

17:40.776 --> 17:42.277
and we'll plan a Christmas party.

17:42.277 --> 17:44.279
Oh, Sam, it'll make
the transition easier

17:44.279 --> 17:45.280
for them and for me.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.282
Well, what are we supposed
to do until December?

17:47.282 --> 17:48.667
Bunk out with Ma Clavin?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.619
No, I mean, we'll do it now.

17:50.619 --> 17:54.006
This year, Christmas comes next week.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.874
Oh... Huh? Oh, it'll be fun.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.377
Oh, gee, I hate it when
they change holidays around

17:58.377 --> 18:00.879
just to make a three-day weekend.

18:07.853 --> 18:11.356
Who's ready for some
delicious hot apple cider?

18:11.356 --> 18:15.727
Can I have mine with ice?
It's 80 degrees outside.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.396
Where's your Christmas spirit, Naomi?

18:17.396 --> 18:19.064
It melted.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.067
There's another present
for you there, Naomi.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.819
Isn't that right, Santa?

18:23.819 --> 18:26.705
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.207
All right, here it is, here it is.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.208
There you go, kid.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.626
There you are.

18:30.626 --> 18:32.628
Oh, boy!

18:32.628 --> 18:34.129
What do you say, Naomi?

18:34.129 --> 18:35.497
Thank you, Santa.

18:35.497 --> 18:36.882
SAM: Ah... And what do you say, Santa?

18:36.882 --> 18:39.251
Yeah, Mrs. Claus is
going to pay for this.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.135
Come here.

18:40.135 --> 18:43.555
Look, look, how much longer
do we have to do this?

18:43.555 --> 18:45.557
Oh, the children are loving it.

18:45.557 --> 18:48.060
Yeah, well, can I at
least take this beard off?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.562
No, no, no, no.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.315
Now, we don't want to
spoil their illusions.

18:53.315 --> 18:55.651
Don't you think the fact
that Santa's here in mid-May

18:56.151 --> 18:59.021
sweating bullets is making 'em
a little suspicious already?

18:59.021 --> 19:01.573
Uh, yes, Santa, what a great idea.

19:01.573 --> 19:04.443
Why don't you lead us all
in some Christmas carols?

19:04.443 --> 19:07.913
Uh, m-m-maybe somebody
else ought to do that.

19:07.913 --> 19:11.783
Uh, Santa's got a little
summer cold going here.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.086
Oh, well, David is the
musician of the family.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.087
Well...

19:15.087 --> 19:17.589
"Let it Snow" in "E" flat.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.092
(plays note)

19:20.092 --> 19:23.846
? Oh, the weather outside is frightful ?

19:23.846 --> 19:26.131
? But the fire is so delightful ?

19:26.131 --> 19:28.800
? And since there's no place to go ?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.304
? Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow... ?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.189
All right, all right, look,
we-we did it, we did it.

19:34.189 --> 19:35.107
They're singing their carols.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.108
We passed out the presents.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.609
Now can we put out the stupid fire

19:37.609 --> 19:39.478
and-and get the Millers
out of here, please?

19:39.478 --> 19:41.780
Oh, but, Sam, we haven't
roasted the chestnuts yet.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.284
Oh, guess again, sweetheart.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.158
Well, you know,

19:53.158 --> 19:54.993
that was great, kids, but I think

19:54.993 --> 19:59.381
perhaps we-we ought to thank
the kind and generous friends...

20:00.499 --> 20:02.668
...who've let us make
this Yuletide possible.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.586
Oh, no. No, no.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.088
You really don't have to.

20:06.088 --> 20:08.090
No, no, not at all.

20:08.090 --> 20:11.093
Now, Sam and Diane
have opened their home--

20:11.093 --> 20:13.345
it is their
home now--

20:13.345 --> 20:14.680
so that we can enjoy

20:14.680 --> 20:19.067
one last Christmas here together.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.320
Well, of course, we've
known a lot of Christmases

20:21.320 --> 20:25.324
around this hearth, but for you kids,

20:25.824 --> 20:27.693
this will be the last one.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.611
And all they'll have

20:29.611 --> 20:33.081
is pictures, home movies

20:33.081 --> 20:35.083
and memories to fill the gap

20:35.083 --> 20:37.085
through their lives.

20:37.085 --> 20:39.588
Oh, I hope the memories survive.

20:39.588 --> 20:41.506
Say you'll remember, children.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.760
CHILDREN: We'll all remember, Grandma.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.045
BERT: Yes, and-and what about Easter?

20:47.045 --> 20:50.515
Will you remember the Easters, too?

20:50.515 --> 20:52.517
I don't remember, Grandpa.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.519
Oh, honey...

20:54.519 --> 20:59.524
Please don't make Grandma
and Grandpa leave, lady.

20:59.524 --> 21:00.892
No, go... Oh, oh,

21:00.892 --> 21:03.145
th-th-they
don't have to.

21:03.145 --> 21:05.063
Listen, why don't you
come over next week,

21:05.063 --> 21:08.066
and we'll have a big Easter egg hunt

21:08.066 --> 21:09.735
right here.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.536
And I will make it an annual occasion.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.288
CHILDREN: Yay!

21:13.288 --> 21:14.906
No, no, no, no!

21:14.906 --> 21:18.827
No, no, I am not putting
on a bunny suit for anybody!

21:19.795 --> 21:21.046
Now, now, listen,

21:21.046 --> 21:22.881
we've done everything--
more than everything--

21:22.881 --> 21:24.883
anybody could possibly expect.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.385
We got to draw the line somewhere here.

21:26.385 --> 21:29.388
I mean, we can't arrange our
lives just for you people.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.890
I mean, this is our house now.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.759
Y-Y-You can't
have it anymore.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.560
Please, I mean,
w-we-we need a chance

21:35.560 --> 21:37.062
to start our own lives here.

21:37.062 --> 21:39.064
I mean, for God's sake, we
haven't even had a chance

21:39.064 --> 21:40.932
to be intimate in our own home yet.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.352
What does Santa mean, Mommy?

21:45.153 --> 21:48.357
Mommy will explain it later, dear.

21:48.357 --> 21:50.025
Yeah, and somewhere else, Mommy.

21:50.025 --> 21:52.327
Uh, c-come on, everybody, please, out.

21:52.327 --> 21:53.328
(children whining)

21:53.328 --> 21:55.330
LILLIAN: Oh, no, no, no.

21:55.330 --> 21:57.833
Now, don't grumble. Santa is right.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.202
He may have been a
little rude about it...

22:02.504 --> 22:03.288
...but it is true.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.673
We have been imposing.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.711
So let's all go over to
Grandma and Grandpa's new condo

22:09.711 --> 22:12.214
and have Christmas there.

22:12.214 --> 22:13.598
CHILDREN: Yay!

22:15.467 --> 22:21.106
? Frosty the Snowman
was a jolly, happy soul ?

22:21.106 --> 22:22.441
Bye-bye, happy holidays.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.943
? With a corncob pipe and button
nose ? Yeah, bye-bye, bye-bye.

22:24.943 --> 22:26.945
? And two eyes made out of
coal... ? There we go. Bye-bye.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.314
Thank you. There we go.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.615
What about our presents?

22:30.615 --> 22:31.983
Uh, we'll ship 'em to you.

22:35.871 --> 22:38.874
I can't believe what you just did, Sam.

22:38.874 --> 22:40.742
I am not going to apologize, Diane.

22:40.742 --> 22:44.129
Suddenly, the house is ours.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.380
You mean that?

22:45.380 --> 22:47.582
You claimed it for me.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.718
Oh. Just stood up

22:49.718 --> 22:53.839
and claimed it for me like
some animal out of the wild.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.008
Oh, Sam...

22:57.008 --> 23:00.312
you're so sexy when you're territorial.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.180
So, uh...

23:02.180 --> 23:03.148
anything special you want

23:03.148 --> 23:05.016
from Santa this year, little girl?

23:05.016 --> 23:07.936
Oh, Santa...

23:07.936 --> 23:10.238
Well, I think that can be arranged.

23:10.238 --> 23:11.523
There you go...

23:11.523 --> 23:12.524
Where is that?

23:12.524 --> 23:14.526
It's in there someplace.

23:16.027 --> 23:18.914
You know, Santa? Hmm?

23:18.914 --> 23:20.365
I think it's time to take you up

23:20.365 --> 23:23.752
on that offer to polish the floor.

23:23.752 --> 23:25.036
Oh, well, uh...

23:25.036 --> 23:27.038
what room would you
like to start in here?

23:27.038 --> 23:31.042
Hmm... how about the dining room?

23:31.042 --> 23:33.545
Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

23:33.545 --> 23:36.047
(Sam laughing)
