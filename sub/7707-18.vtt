J-K-L-M-N-O-P.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.012
Huh? Oh.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.284
Are you still thinking
about that girl?

00:19.286 --> 00:22.154
Ever since I saw her
star in the school play

00:22.156 --> 00:23.822
I can't think of nothin' else.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.792
What do they call
this temptress?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.060
Her name is..

00:29.330 --> 00:30.729
...Laura.

00:31.699 --> 00:35.701
And how<i> does...Laura..</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:39.304
...feel<i> about...Jake?</i>

00:39.306 --> 00:41.707
She doesn't know I'm alive.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.410
No problem,
you walk up to her and say

00:44.412 --> 00:48.380
"Hi, I'm Jake Ochmonek.
Feel my pulse."

00:49.350 --> 00:51.683
Did I mention her amazin' eyes?

00:51.685 --> 00:55.487
Yeah, they're on springs
and they bounce out of her head.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.854
Hi, guys, what's up?

02:01.856 --> 02:04.223
Jake's got the flying hots
for this girl at school.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.825
But anytime he gets near her,
he spaces.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.461
- ALF!
- Did I leave something out?

02:10.698 --> 02:13.899
ALF, I-I think
you may be embarrassing Jake.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.167
Really?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.637
Kate, you're good
at unsolicited advice.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.240
Tell Jake what to do.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.075
Well..

02:23.077 --> 02:26.078
Maybe it would be easier if you
called this girl on the phone.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.582
I could,
but if I did, I'd die.

02:30.584 --> 02:34.653
He can't seem to talk
to the opposite sex these days.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.788
Well, if it would
be any help at all

02:36.790 --> 02:38.924
you could practice on me.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.293
I-it wouldn't be the same,
Mrs. Tanner.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.061
Laura's much more..

02:44.198 --> 02:45.964
She's beautiful.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.101
I see.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.140
You've got a way with women.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.042
You don't understand.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.911
Sure, I do.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.914
Hey, I was once hooked
on a babe named Rhonda.

03:01.916 --> 03:06.585
When I tried to say hi to her
I sounded like Gomer Pyle.

03:06.587 --> 03:10.222
- Talkin', not singin'.
- Then what'd you do?

03:10.224 --> 03:13.192
I wrote her letters
from a secret admirer.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.762
I-I don't think I could do that.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.031
Okay, then let me
write it for ya.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.568
- I don't know.
- Come on, Jake.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.903
Let me make
your love connection.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.639
Think of me
as your wooly Chuck Woolery.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.310
Okay. Alright, maybe just one.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.611
Great.

[instrumental music]

03:40.087 --> 03:41.620
Hi, ALF.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.490
Willie, what's another word
for beautiful?

03:45.492 --> 03:48.660
Umm, attractive.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.662
What's another word
for attractive?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.065
Uh, alluring.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.634
What's another word
for alluring?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.003
Annoying.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.938
What's another word
for annoying?

03:59.940 --> 04:03.375
- ALF.
- That won't work.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.011
It doesn't rhyme
with oh, baby.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.048
What are you working on there?

04:10.050 --> 04:13.819
This is a missive of love on
behalf of young Jake Ochmonek.

04:13.821 --> 04:17.189
Jake...is in love?

04:17.191 --> 04:19.157
Disgustingly so.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.727
But he thinks of himself
as just another scrawny

04:21.729 --> 04:23.829
gawky, geeky kid.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.297
You remember
the feeling, Willie.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.698
[chuckling]
Ah..

04:28.702 --> 04:30.636
You better, uh,
you better be careful, ALF.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.938
You can get into trouble
playing Cyrano.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.074
Is that like Monopoly?

04:36.076 --> 04:38.877
No, I'm talking
about "Cyrano de Bergerac."

04:38.879 --> 04:42.281
It's a play. I-I've got a copy
of it somewhere.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.950
It's-it's a classical
French play

04:44.952 --> 04:47.686
about a man named Christian

04:47.688 --> 04:49.988
who falls in love
with a beautiful woman

04:49.990 --> 04:52.924
but he is too embarrassed
to talk to her.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.595
- That sounds like Jake.
- Exactly.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.897
So he gets his friend Cyrano

04:58.899 --> 05:01.199
to-to write a letter
to the girl for him

05:01.201 --> 05:06.438
because Cyrano is-is so gifted
and sensitive.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.574
That sounds like me.

05:09.576 --> 05:12.010
Cyrano's a great romantic

05:12.012 --> 05:14.413
but he is ashamed
to talk to women in person

05:14.415 --> 05:16.848
because he's got a very big..

05:19.186 --> 05:21.720
And they all lived
happily ever after.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.123
Whoa, whoa!
Big-big-big...big what?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.059
Umm, mmm, nose.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.695
- Huh?
- Umm, nose.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.962
What?

05:32.166 --> 05:35.100
Very large nose.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.237
Well, why didn't you say so?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.673
Well, I thought I..
I mean, I.. I thought I--

05:41.675 --> 05:43.008
You thought I might be offended

05:43.010 --> 05:45.977
because this Cyrano guy
had a jumbo hooter

05:45.979 --> 05:48.780
and I happen to take a husky
in snout warmers?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.050
Oh, yes.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.354
No problem.
I'm not that vain.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.659
Oh, I'm sorry, ALF. I..

06:00.661 --> 06:03.228
I guess I misjudged you.

Jake! Find the runway
and set her down.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.496
- She liked the letter.
- Yes!

07:11.498 --> 07:13.598
Especially the part
where you compared her skin

07:13.600 --> 07:16.802
to vanilla ice cream
under the hot fudge of her hair.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.171

07:19.173 --> 07:22.774
Laura's very curious
about her secret admirer

07:22.776 --> 07:25.177
so, uh, I was thinkin'
of actually

07:25.179 --> 07:27.913
maybe sayin' something to her.

But you said when she takes

You gotta wait till she bites,
then you reel her in.

around the deck a while

07:41.428 --> 07:44.229

I'm her secret admirer.

- Why not?

Uh..

I'm-I'm afraid
I might move you to laughter.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.117
Why are you afraid?

from the way you write

13:37.517 --> 13:39.851
that you're very special.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.962
Uh, I'm tellin' myself
that I've said too much.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.232
Shut up!
I'm sayin' to myself.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.334
But I'm not listening.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.704
You sound different.
I'm coming down.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.272
No, no, wait.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.575
- ALF!
- Yes?

14:03.577 --> 14:07.312
- Hide.
- You can't hide from love.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.681
- Her dad's a cop.
- That you can hide from.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.951
- 'Oww!'
- ALF!

14:14.688 --> 14:17.622
- Who's back here?
- Ehh..

14:17.624 --> 14:21.359
It's me, your secret admirer.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.994
Didn't I see you this morning?

14:22.996 --> 14:25.964
Uh, no, that couldn't..
I-I wasn't--

14:25.966 --> 14:28.299
- You were cute.
- That was me.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.935
- What's your name?
- Jake.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.670
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.342
Uh, you,
you wanna go to a movie

14:37.344 --> 14:39.043
or something Saturday?

14:39.045 --> 14:42.247
- Okay.
- Alright!

14:42.249 --> 14:45.583
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.652
So you like "LA Law," huh?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.787
Yeah, especially the couple
with the short guy

14:49.789 --> 14:51.923
and the tall woman.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.258
Yes!

14:54.361 --> 14:55.960
[ALF grunting]

14:58.231 --> 15:01.599
You kids go ahead.
Don't worry about me.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.668
Aah! Ah!

15:09.576 --> 15:12.277
Okay, ALF, there's-there's
only one more thorn

15:12.279 --> 15:14.245
but this one's in kind of deep.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.381
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.886
Ready.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.723
- Urgh!
- All done.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.594
That's it? That didn't
hurt so<i> mu-u-uch!</i>

15:29.596 --> 15:33.031
- Sorry, ALF.
- No problem.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.235
You realize you took a big risk
going out like that.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.803
I know.

15:38.805 --> 15:42.307
But it was very noble of you
to wanna help Jake.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.643
Thank you
from the heart of my bottom.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.546
You know, speaking those words
of love tonight..

15:48.548 --> 15:52.183
...made me realize
that I'll never be with Rhonda.

15:52.185 --> 15:56.020
Well, maybe
someday you will, ALF.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.923
Oh, don't humor me, Katherine.

15:58.925 --> 16:03.995
Cyrano and I are both doomed to
spend our lives without a mate.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.398
At least he got to jump around
with a sword and wear feathers.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.070
I-I don't like to see you
like this, ALF.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.839
Don't worry about me.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.842
[yawns]

16:17.844 --> 16:19.077
I'll tell you what.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.879
What if we go out back,
uh, dig a big hole

16:21.881 --> 16:24.515
muddy it up
and then you jump in?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.751
No, thank you.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.553
Well, how about if I go out
in the kitchen right now

16:28.555 --> 16:29.854
and make your favorite dish?

16:29.856 --> 16:32.023
Everything,
with everything on it?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.526
I'm not hungry.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.496
Isn't there anything you want?

16:38.498 --> 16:42.100
I just wanna wallow
in self-pity for a while.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.336
We will give you some privacy.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.338
But if you happen to be
near a video store

16:47.340 --> 16:49.240
would you mind
renting me something?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.642
Well, certainly.
What do you want?

16:51.644 --> 16:55.079
- "Love Story."
- Okay.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.816
- And "Wuthering Heights."
- Yeah, sure.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.387
And the breakup episode
of "Joanie Loves Chachi."

17:04.057 --> 17:06.057
[instrumental music]

17:16.002 --> 17:19.270
Alright, Willie,
what's so important?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.372
I was watching "Love Story."

17:21.374 --> 17:24.142
You know the death scene
is considerably more depressing

17:24.144 --> 17:26.377
in slow motion.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.579
ALF, you gotta cheer up.

17:29.949 --> 17:35.353
No. I am destined
to live a retched existence..

17:35.355 --> 17:39.057
...barren of love.
I am Cyrano.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.794
You're nothing like Cyrano.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.864
Look more closely.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.401
Physical characteristics
not withstanding.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.869
You see, for all his poetry

17:51.871 --> 17:54.639
Cyrano wasn't able to tell
people close to him

17:54.641 --> 17:56.441
how he really felt.

17:56.443 --> 18:00.078
You, on the other hand,
can and do..

18:00.080 --> 18:01.712
...at all hours.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.816
That's true.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.584
And you've got something else.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.687
Something that might have
saved Cyrano's life.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.156
You have the ability
to laugh at yourself.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.626
Well, I do have
that ability, don't I?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.029
Ha. Ha!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.866
Now all I need is a woman.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.769
I think I got that covered.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.172
I don't want Kate.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.676
No. Look.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.779
I've attached the ham radio
to the satellite dish

18:34.781 --> 18:37.982
and I've pointed the dish
toward the Andromeda Galaxy.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.183
[radio static]

18:39.185 --> 18:42.086
Very nice, Willie.
You win the science fair.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.889
No, no. Don't you see?

18:44.891 --> 18:47.792
You'll be able to send
a message to Rhonda.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.095
Your words will travel
right across the cosmos.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.098
And then if she's tuned
into the right frequency

18:54.100 --> 18:56.134
she'll hear you.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.168
Oh!

18:58.138 --> 18:59.570
Okay.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.307
Umm, hi.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.076
Hi, Rhonda.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.812
It's me. I..

19:14.053 --> 19:18.689
[clears throat]
I, uh, I read a play

19:18.691 --> 19:21.292
about this guy with a big nose.

19:21.294 --> 19:25.029
And, uh, it seems he can't
have the woman he loves.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.166
Remind you of anybody?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.837
I was wondering if you got any
letters from a secret admirer

19:32.839 --> 19:34.672
and if you liked them.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.208
If you did, they were from me.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.243
If you didn't like them..

19:39.245 --> 19:40.745
What letters?

19:42.448 --> 19:44.515
Anyway..

19:44.517 --> 19:47.018
...I hope you're okay.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.288
And I never told you
this before, but..

19:50.290 --> 19:52.290
...you're a definite<i> papoon.</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:56.227
Well, bye.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.635
Well, that was beautiful, ALF.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.171
Uh, I assume.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.841
Thanks, Willie.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.244
I can see clearly now.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.912
The rain has gone.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.582
I can see all popsicles
in my way.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.552
I'm glad.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.222
You know,
it's gonna take 146 years

20:24.224 --> 20:27.758
for that message
to get anywhere near Andromeda.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.296
Oh, ALF, I didn't think
about that. I'm-I'm sorry.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.332
Nah, it's okay.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.569
That's twice as fast
as Melmacian Express Mail.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.238
Ha. Ha!

Wait, wait.

Well, Brian,
this is a dog whistle.

21:19.212 --> 21:21.312

21:29.656 --> 21:31.489
You can hear that?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.491
Oh, yeah!

21:33.493 --> 21:35.559
Well, that's amazing.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.295
What did it sound like?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.663
Kind of like a freight train

21:38.665 --> 21:40.398

the middle of my head

- Hi.
- 'Hi, Jake.'

21:49.309 --> 21:52.276
- Hi.
- So how went the big date?

21:53.579 --> 21:56.113
It went pretty okay.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.849
[chuckles]
Well, that's not
a very glowing report.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.751
Was there some problem?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.620
Well, she's real nice
and everything

22:02.622 --> 22:04.388
but she's got this laugh.

22:04.390 --> 22:07.792
It's kinda high-pitched
and it's kinda whiny.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.261
It's kind of annoying.

22:10.263 --> 22:12.997
So you're gonna dump Laura
because of her laugh?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.899
I'll probably go out
with her again

22:14.901 --> 22:18.202
but, uh, not to anything funny.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.404
Nothing sounds that bad.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.039
You said that does.
