WEBVTT

00:04.034 --> 00:05.448
Get off of me!

00:05.586 --> 00:07.965
- Favorite comfort food?
- My dairy-free Mac and Cheese.

00:08.103 --> 00:09.655
- Chicken and waffles.
- Yes!

00:09.793 --> 00:12.275
- Chicken and waffles!
- Damn, girl, you'’re killing it!

00:12.413 --> 00:14.413
How does she not
know those things?

00:14.551 --> 00:16.103
And why not me, Bennet?

00:16.965 --> 00:18.517
I'’m cheating on her with you.

00:18.655 --> 00:20.448
Well, if you'’re so worried
about it, stop cheating.

00:20.586 --> 00:23.379
Some things can'’t be fixed.
Just learn to deal and move on.

00:23.517 --> 00:25.137
You guys keep saying this,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.965
but it'’s not getting any better.
It'’s getting worse.

00:27.103 --> 00:30.655
You had sex with him.
At the man'’s wedding shower?

00:40.965 --> 00:42.724
I know I'’m not innocent in this.

00:42.931 --> 00:45.517
I turned a blind eye when
everything in me told me

00:45.655 --> 00:47.344
that there was a connection
between the two of you.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.413
Alison, I'’m so sorry.
I didn'’t mean to hurt you.

00:49.551 --> 00:51.482
Really, Gwen?
When you screwed my fiancée

00:51.620 --> 00:54.068
at my wedding shower
in my house, in my bathroom--

00:54.206 --> 00:56.310
- This is on me!
- It'’s on both of you!

00:56.896 --> 00:59.965
But life doesn'’t allow us to go
back and undo what happened.

01:00.448 --> 01:02.896
It allows us to do better
moving forward.

01:03.034 --> 01:04.655
I don'’t understand,
why are we here?

01:04.793 --> 01:07.448
I want you,
but I'’m not willing to share.

01:08.206 --> 01:11.586
If you want me, it'’s all in.
No looking back.

01:13.034 --> 01:16.275
Can you look me in my eye right
now and promise that to me?

01:18.172 --> 01:19.517
The answer is no.

01:20.965 --> 01:24.275
There'’s obviously unfinished
business between the two of you.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.482
I want you to finish it.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.275
Maybe it'’s my connection
with Buddhism,

01:30.413 --> 01:34.137
that life is permeated
with suffering caused by desire.

01:34.379 --> 01:36.931
And that suffering ceases
when desire ceases.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.172
Or I'’m just completely
masochistic.

01:42.241 --> 01:45.275
Either way,
I'’m giving you 30 days.

01:46.310 --> 01:49.206
- Thirty days for what?
- To resolve, finish,

01:49.344 --> 01:51.344
or confirm whatever this is.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.517
- What'’s the catch?
- No catch.

01:58.137 --> 02:00.517
If you want to be with her,
then so be it.

02:01.068 --> 02:05.172
But if you come back to me,
you'’re with me.

02:05.344 --> 02:09.172
- No more bullshit. Fair?
- This whole thing seems weird--

02:09.310 --> 02:12.517
Gwen, if I were you, I would
just shut up and say thank you.

02:14.241 --> 02:15.482
Do we all understand each other?

02:16.413 --> 02:18.448
You might want to come by
the house and grab a few things.

02:18.965 --> 02:22.275
I don'’t want to see or hear
from you until you decide.

02:25.482 --> 02:29.482
And don'’t worry.
I get 30 days too.

02:45.275 --> 02:48.103
Is she even human?
What the hell just happened?

02:48.241 --> 02:49.413
Alison!

03:11.551 --> 03:13.034
He went back
to the stick figure?

03:13.172 --> 03:14.758
I don'’t know.
He just left me sitting there

03:14.896 --> 03:17.068
and got up and ran after her,
which I get, I guess.

03:17.206 --> 03:19.379
The whole thing
was just so messed up.

03:19.517 --> 03:21.655
Alison was Stepford Wife-calm.
If it were me, there would be

03:21.793 --> 03:24.241
a lot more hair pulling.
We'’d definitely knuckle up.

03:28.448 --> 03:29.896
My creditor'’s calling you too?

03:30.034 --> 03:32.448
- No, just Dodson.
- What does he want now?

03:32.586 --> 03:34.413
Sex on top of the
Empire State Building?

03:35.172 --> 03:38.241
- He left his wife.
- He what? For you?

03:38.379 --> 03:40.448
That shocked reaction
is less than flattering.

03:40.586 --> 03:42.517
No, I mean... it'’s great news.
Right?

03:42.655 --> 03:44.862
I don'’t know.
Him trying to make things easier

03:45.000 --> 03:46.965
just made things
far more complicated.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.551
Girl, only you can think that
a man wanting to be with you,

03:49.689 --> 03:51.413
no strings attached,
was complicated.

03:51.551 --> 03:53.000
I know that it sounds horrible,

03:53.137 --> 03:54.862
but him being married
was part of the thrill.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.241
Without the secret sex in his
office and sneaking around,

03:57.379 --> 04:00.206
- what'’s the point?
- Um, emotional connection.

04:00.827 --> 04:03.448
You should, you know,
give it a try.

04:06.068 --> 04:07.620
- Are you not going to work?
- No.

04:07.758 --> 04:09.413
I'’m still under Tom'’s
forced vacation.

04:09.551 --> 04:11.965
So, the walls will be washed
and the grout will be cleaned

04:12.103 --> 04:13.551
when I get home?

04:13.689 --> 04:16.068
If you hire a housekeeper.
My name ain'’t Florence.

04:17.103 --> 04:19.137
- OK, Wheezy.
- Bye.

04:22.793 --> 04:27.034
I was on my way to work.
A cop car pulls up.

04:27.172 --> 04:30.965
Punk-ass cop asks me for my ID
and what I was doing.

04:31.482 --> 04:34.068
I was late and I knew
the stop was bullshit.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.655
So I told him I wasn'’t going
to allow him to search me.

04:37.241 --> 04:39.137
- So, what happened?
- Let me guess.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.724
Your face ended
up against a brick wall.

04:42.379 --> 04:45.137
Hood of a car.
Cop called me a nigga,

04:45.275 --> 04:47.206
said that he was gonna
crack my skull open.

04:47.344 --> 04:48.862
Did he tell you
why he stopped you?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.379
He said he saw a bulge
in my pocket.

04:50.517 --> 04:51.931
- Smokes?
- Cell.

04:52.068 --> 04:53.758
Well, I talked to the prosecutor

04:53.896 --> 04:56.482
and, since you don'’t have
a criminal record,

04:56.620 --> 04:58.172
they'’re offering to drop
the obstruction

04:58.310 --> 05:00.620
and resisting arrest charges
and give you time served,

05:00.758 --> 05:02.793
if you plead guilty
to disorderly conduct.

05:02.931 --> 05:04.310
It'’s a violation, not a crime.

05:04.448 --> 05:06.413
It'’s like pleading guilty
to a parking ticket.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.793
Oh, hell no. No, no.
I ain'’t copping out.

05:08.931 --> 05:11.620
Well, since it'’s a misdemeanor,
you don'’t get a jury.

05:11.758 --> 05:13.448
It'’s a judge trial.
And, to win, we have to prove

05:13.586 --> 05:15.344
that the arrest was illegal,
which means we have to prove

05:15.482 --> 05:16.827
that it was done
without what'’s called--

05:16.965 --> 05:18.862
Reasonable suspicion. I know.

05:19.206 --> 05:22.724
I'’ve been stopped like 40 times
in the past 11 years.

05:23.241 --> 05:25.448
- Excuse me?
- The first time I was stopped,

05:25.586 --> 05:26.793
I was ten years old.

05:26.931 --> 05:28.482
In the past six months,
probably 12.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.689
- Three times by this same cop.
- The hell with that.

05:31.827 --> 05:33.034
- No plea.
- But--

05:33.172 --> 05:34.482
But here'’s what
you need to know.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.551
It'’s not a slam dunk, OK?

05:36.689 --> 05:38.551
The officer'’s going to lie
about why he stopped you.

05:38.689 --> 05:41.034
It'’s going to be your word
against his.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.517
I'’m tired of this shit.

05:47.241 --> 05:51.103
Tired of bending over cop cars
and kissing the pavement.

05:51.379 --> 05:52.482
I'’ve got to fight this.

05:52.862 --> 05:54.344
'‘Cause if I don'’t
fight it in here,

05:54.482 --> 05:56.379
I'’m gonna keep fighting it
out there,

05:56.517 --> 06:00.172
- and I'’ll probably end up dead.
- Then let'’s take it to '‘em.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.793
Did you know that
between 2002 and 2015,

06:04.931 --> 06:07.413
over five million people were
stopped and frisked in NY City,

06:07.551 --> 06:09.448
and 86% of all stops-and-frisks
were done

06:09.586 --> 06:12.793
without reasonable suspicion?
In a city that is 66% minority,

06:12.931 --> 06:15.827
81% of all stops-and-frisks
are of black and brown people.

06:15.965 --> 06:20.137
I didn'’t know it, but I knew it.
From personal experience.

06:20.275 --> 06:22.413
- You mean your arrest?
- Yeah.

06:23.206 --> 06:25.965
Don'’t tell me you'’ve never been
stopped in a department store.

06:26.103 --> 06:28.896
Never had a white person ask
"“may I help you?"” in that tone

06:29.034 --> 06:31.103
where you know they don'’t
really want to help you?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.000
Actually, no. I mean...

06:33.137 --> 06:35.413
I know it happens.
I'’m not saying it doesn'’t.

06:35.551 --> 06:38.551
- Followed in department store?
- Well...

06:39.413 --> 06:40.793
There it is.

06:40.931 --> 06:43.586
After Oprah got stopped in Paris
I started to wonder.

06:43.724 --> 06:45.965
I mean... if it happens
to Oprah, right?

06:46.103 --> 06:48.241
So I noticed this guy
following me at the mall,

06:48.379 --> 06:50.551
but it was only
that one time, though.

06:50.689 --> 06:52.448
Trust me.
You got followed 100 times.

06:52.586 --> 06:55.068
- You just didn'’t notice it.
- The thing is, I don'’t know

06:55.206 --> 06:57.172
that he was following me
because I'’m black.

06:57.310 --> 06:59.655
He wasn'’t following Suzie Q,
you can believe that.

07:00.172 --> 07:02.310
And, if you had confronted him,
he would have made some

07:02.448 --> 07:05.206
bullshit excuse that sounded
plausible on its face.

07:05.586 --> 07:07.172
Which is what the cop
will do here.

07:07.310 --> 07:09.551
It'’s called tester-lying.
The cop who stopped Marcus

07:09.689 --> 07:11.241
will lie about the basis
for the stop.

07:11.379 --> 07:13.931
It'’s standard cop procedure.
DA'’s condone it.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.275
Judges don'’t question it.

07:15.413 --> 07:16.827
So, how do we prove
that he'’s lying?

07:16.965 --> 07:19.103
- You mean, how do you prove it?
- Wait, what?

07:19.241 --> 07:20.827
You'’re going to cross-examine
the cop, rookie.

07:21.137 --> 07:24.275
- Oh, my Gosh.
- Don'’t panic. Focus.

07:24.689 --> 07:26.517
Now, how would we prove
that he'’s full of shit?

07:26.655 --> 07:29.310
Well, I read that
the Bronx Defenders

07:29.448 --> 07:31.137
and the Center for
Constitutional Rights

07:31.275 --> 07:34.344
took the City to Federal Court
over their stop-and-frisk policy

07:34.482 --> 07:36.068
- and won a consent decree.
- Uh-huh.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.827
Now, all the cops
have to fill out a form

07:37.965 --> 07:39.896
stating their reasons every time
they stop-and-frisk someone.

07:40.034 --> 07:41.827
And you want to see
all this cop'’s forms

07:41.965 --> 07:43.724
and see if all of this stops
are bogus.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.551
That'’s a great idea.

07:45.689 --> 07:47.310
Except, when you subpoena
the police department,

07:47.448 --> 07:49.862
they'’re going to move
to quash it. Do you know why?

07:51.655 --> 07:53.206
The prosecution will argue

07:53.344 --> 07:54.965
that the forms related
to the cop'’s previous stops

07:55.103 --> 07:57.000
aren'’t relevant to evaluating
reasonable suspicion

07:57.137 --> 07:58.275
in this particular case.

07:58.413 --> 07:59.965
Look who'’s been
paying attention!

08:01.172 --> 08:02.413
So, what do we do?

08:02.551 --> 08:04.655
Get that cop
to make it relevant.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.310
Aaaaargh!

08:24.241 --> 08:27.241
Tracy, take your key with you
next time you go running!

08:28.068 --> 08:29.344
God!

08:32.103 --> 08:33.827
Oh, my God! Hi!

08:34.482 --> 08:38.206
- I wasn'’t expecting company.
- Can I come in?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.517
It'’s a nice place.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.517
Yeah, well, Architectural Digest
wanted to photograph it,

08:52.655 --> 08:54.793
but I told them "“nah"”.

08:55.448 --> 08:57.034
Gwen, I want to apologize
for yesterday--

08:57.172 --> 09:00.310
Bennet, you don'’t owe me
an apology. I made a mistake.

09:00.896 --> 09:04.586
You are not my man and...
someone was bound to get hurt.

09:04.965 --> 09:07.344
That someone was me.
But that'’s what I get.

09:07.482 --> 09:09.137
'‘Cause I know better
than to play with fire.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.655
- How spontaneous are you?
- What?

09:11.793 --> 09:13.965
I have a car waiting for us
downstairs.

09:18.103 --> 09:22.034
Pack a bag. That 30 days...
it starts now.

09:24.758 --> 09:27.482
Okay, give me...
Give me ten minutes.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.758
I observed the defendant
in a high-crime neighborhood

09:44.896 --> 09:46.482
with a bulge in his
waistband area,

09:46.620 --> 09:48.137
that I suspected was a weapon.

09:48.517 --> 09:50.103
We followed him for
a short distance,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.379
at which time he engaged
in furtive behavior.

09:52.517 --> 09:54.793
- What did you do?
- I got out, I asked the suspect

09:54.931 --> 09:56.862
to take his hands
out of his jacket pockets

09:57.000 --> 09:58.448
and to show me some ID.

09:58.586 --> 10:00.586
He immediately became
verbally combative with me.

10:00.724 --> 10:02.724
- How so?
- He refused to be searched.

10:02.862 --> 10:04.827
I informed him that, if he
continue to be uncooperative,

10:04.965 --> 10:06.655
that I was going to
have to arrest him.

10:06.793 --> 10:09.586
He continued to refuse
so I placed him in custody.

10:09.724 --> 10:11.241
No further questions.

10:12.206 --> 10:14.413
So, you say you had
several reasons

10:14.551 --> 10:16.344
you decided to
follow Mr. Dumay?

10:16.482 --> 10:19.655
- Don'’t ask him. Tell him.
- Yeah, like I said: bulge,

10:19.793 --> 10:23.172
neighborhood, furtive gestures,
trifective suspiciousness.

10:25.413 --> 10:27.827
- But the first thing--
- Was the bulge.

10:28.275 --> 10:30.827
- Could'’ve been a gun...
- Um, is she new?

10:30.965 --> 10:32.724
- It'’s okay. Re-focus.
- Officer, you stated

10:32.862 --> 10:34.827
that the defendant
acted suspiciously, right?

10:34.965 --> 10:36.965
- Objection!
- Sustained.

10:38.413 --> 10:40.758
When you stopped him you said
he didn'’t want to be searched.

10:40.896 --> 10:42.586
- Objection!
- Sustained.

10:42.724 --> 10:44.137
Seriously, Noreen?

10:46.965 --> 10:49.172
Officer, can you please re-state

10:49.310 --> 10:52.379
what the defendant'’s furtive
movements were exactly?

10:52.517 --> 10:54.103
When he saw that we were
following him,

10:54.241 --> 10:55.793
he changed direction, kept
looking over his shoulder at us.

10:55.931 --> 10:58.586
He looked at you.
That sounds so suspicious!

10:58.793 --> 10:59.965
Now you can object.

11:00.241 --> 11:02.172
Okay, let'’s quite the game,
counselors.

11:02.310 --> 11:05.413
The bulge in Mr. Dumay'’s jeans
turned out to be a cell phone,

11:05.551 --> 11:06.896
- right?
- Yeah, but--

11:07.034 --> 11:08.413
And there are lots of reasons
why a person

11:08.551 --> 11:10.172
walking down the street,
carrying a cell phone,

11:10.310 --> 11:11.586
might turn in another direction
when they see you coming.

11:11.724 --> 11:14.241
- Correct?
- Legitimate reasons, no.

11:14.379 --> 11:15.655
How about, they don'’t like cops?

11:15.793 --> 11:17.206
Or their cousin was beat up
by a cop?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.965
Or how about:
it'’s their God-given right

11:19.103 --> 11:21.206
to walk in whichever direction
they damn well choose?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.620
Counselor, I'’ve got
10 years in the force.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.620
And, let me tell you.
Usually, when someone'’s

11:26.758 --> 11:28.965
avoiding the police,
they'’re doing something wrong.

11:29.103 --> 11:31.344
So when you stop someone
it'’s always justified, right?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.068
- Yes.
- Because you would never

11:33.206 --> 11:35.896
illegally stop someone on a whim
or because they just looked

11:36.034 --> 11:37.655
- fishy, would you?
- Never.

11:37.793 --> 11:40.724
Judge, this officer suggests
his stops are always justified

11:40.862 --> 11:42.965
and that he never illegally
stops someone.

11:43.275 --> 11:45.172
The subpoena for the
UF-250 forms

11:45.310 --> 11:47.689
allows us to evaluate
the credibility of that answer.

11:47.827 --> 11:50.413
Grant Gathers, counsel for the
New York City Police Department.

11:50.551 --> 11:53.034
Your Honor,
this subpoena is overly broad,

11:53.172 --> 11:55.344
cumbersome to respond to,
and requests material

11:55.482 --> 11:57.172
that is irrelevant
to the matter at hand today.

11:57.310 --> 11:58.793
How is it irrelevant?

11:58.931 --> 12:00.620
Because the other stops
the office made are not relevant

12:00.758 --> 12:02.965
as to whether he had reasonable
suspicion in this stop.

12:03.103 --> 12:04.758
Of course they are!

12:04.896 --> 12:06.655
Let'’s say he stops 100 people
and all forms for those stops

12:06.793 --> 12:09.310
appear to give valid reasons
for those stops, but maybe

12:09.448 --> 12:12.137
one or two of those people
actually have contraband.

12:12.275 --> 12:14.724
Then, arguably, he'’s lying
when he fills out those forms,

12:14.862 --> 12:17.137
and thus lying here.
And, if he stops more people

12:17.275 --> 12:19.172
than his fellow officers,
then we'’ll know that he thinks

12:19.310 --> 12:21.379
that every person he sees
in a high-crime neighborhood

12:21.517 --> 12:23.758
is a criminal
in need of a good frisk.

12:24.275 --> 12:26.241
Atta girl, Miss Hastings!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.310
Nice to see a rookie
gain her footing.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.241
Your Honor, this is the worst
kind of fishing expedition.

12:31.379 --> 12:34.517
I tend to agree with
the fishing expedition part.

12:34.655 --> 12:37.310
This police department
is turning communities of color

12:37.448 --> 12:39.448
in this city
into Civil Rights-free zones.

12:39.586 --> 12:42.275
By way of example,
in Brownsville, Brooklyn in 2009

12:42.413 --> 12:45.896
93 out of every 100 residents
were stopped by the NYPD.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.827
And that'’s why the Bronx
defenders won their lawsuit,

12:47.965 --> 12:50.034
and that'’s why these officers
have to fill out this form.

12:50.172 --> 12:53.448
It'’s also why a federal monitor
is dealing with this issue.

12:53.862 --> 12:57.482
I'’ll take the defense'’s request
for a subpoena under advisement.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.275
- Your Honor!
- No, no!

12:59.413 --> 13:01.793
Mr. Riggs,
don'’t press your luck.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.172
- What is this place?
- A wellness retreat center.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.586
- With activity periods?
- Come on! It could be fun.

13:53.724 --> 13:58.241
It'’s like a cross between
a spa and a summer camp.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.931
You know being around
white folks and robes

14:00.068 --> 14:01.965
makes me nervous, right?

14:04.172 --> 14:05.965
Well, when they'’re sipping
herbal tea,

14:06.103 --> 14:07.931
it probably reduces
their threat level.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.310
Yeah, but no one here is
wearing any regular clothes.

14:10.448 --> 14:12.413
It'’s not a nudist colony, is it?

14:14.655 --> 14:16.344
In our suite, maybe.

14:33.758 --> 14:35.862
I thought we had a rule,
Richard.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.413
No public meetings.
Thank you.

14:45.068 --> 14:46.551
Well, I left Audrey,

14:46.689 --> 14:48.482
and this is far enough away
from the courthouse.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.655
Except we can'’t
have sex here, honey.

14:51.206 --> 14:52.931
Unless you have a thing
for public bathrooms

14:53.068 --> 14:54.482
that I don'’t know about.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.344
I thought it would be nice
if we shared a meal.

14:57.862 --> 15:00.827
Where we just talked, actually
got to know each other a little.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.413
A glass of Chardonnay.
Thanks.

15:07.310 --> 15:10.655
Okay. What do you
want to know?

15:10.793 --> 15:13.137
Well, I know you grew up
in North Carolina.

15:13.793 --> 15:16.862
So, tell me about your family.

15:19.758 --> 15:22.310
- Two brothers, one sister.
- Uh-huh.

15:22.448 --> 15:24.517
And were you all close,
growing up?

15:24.655 --> 15:27.620
- We got along fine.
- Define "“fine"”.

15:29.206 --> 15:31.586
My brothers and I
were like peas in a pod,

15:31.724 --> 15:34.827
and my sister and I,
we just always fought.

15:35.482 --> 15:38.413
- Was she jealous of you?
- I don'’t know, actually.

15:38.551 --> 15:41.137
She just...
never really liked me.

15:42.241 --> 15:47.310
- That must have been hard.
- Your turn!

15:50.068 --> 15:52.758
I grew up in New Jersey.
My father was a lawyer.

15:53.862 --> 15:55.241
I wanted to be a painter,

15:55.379 --> 15:58.068
but then I met Audrey,
and she got pregnant.

15:58.206 --> 16:00.344
You know you'’ve never asked me
about Audrey?

16:01.862 --> 16:03.965
You never asked
why the marriage wasn'’t working.

16:04.103 --> 16:06.413
Because I don'’t really
want to know, sugar.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.862
Okay. Why wasn'’t your
marriage working?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.103
- Thank you.
- Well,

16:13.241 --> 16:15.068
I don'’t think I was
ever really in love with her.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.206
I think we reached a point
where marriage

16:17.344 --> 16:18.793
was the next right step.

16:19.827 --> 16:23.068
Also, you never asked me
why I didn'’t leave her.

16:23.206 --> 16:24.862
I just figured
you didn'’t have the balls.

16:25.379 --> 16:29.482
- Well, okay. What about you?
- What about me what?

16:29.620 --> 16:31.379
Why are you sleeping
with married men?

16:31.551 --> 16:34.965
- Men?
- I assume I'’m not the first.

16:35.103 --> 16:37.586
Which begs the question,
doesn'’t it:

16:37.724 --> 16:39.103
What are you avoiding?

16:39.241 --> 16:41.103
You know what, sugar?
I forgot that I have cases

16:41.241 --> 16:43.379
going on in Part F
this afternoon.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.413
I booked a hotel room
for us tonight.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.620
Yeah? Is it going to be
20 questions again?

16:51.758 --> 16:53.413
Or can we just screw?

16:55.206 --> 16:57.620
- We can just screw.
- Good.

16:57.758 --> 16:59.482
I'’ll see you tonight, then.

17:02.172 --> 17:04.689
I was on my way to class
at Manhattan Community College.

17:04.827 --> 17:06.206
Cops rolled up on me.

17:06.344 --> 17:09.482
That one asked for my ID
and what I was doing.

17:10.068 --> 17:13.241
I told him I knew my rights and
I ain'’t consenting to no search.

17:13.379 --> 17:16.448
He threw me on top of his car,
searched me anyway,

17:16.586 --> 17:18.379
cussed me out,
called me a nigga.

17:18.517 --> 17:21.586
Did you explain why you didn'’t
cooperate with Officer Porter?

17:21.724 --> 17:23.379
I was just tired
of being stopped.

17:23.517 --> 17:25.965
It'’s always the same:
I got a bulge in my waistband,

17:26.103 --> 17:29.724
my jacket pocket, in my pants,
or I "“fit the description"”.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.448
You know, that'’s a favorite one
of theirs.

17:32.586 --> 17:35.137
Except they never tell you
what the description is.

17:35.275 --> 17:38.103
How has constantly being stopped
by police affected your life?

17:38.241 --> 17:40.034
Objection, Your Honor!
Relevance.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.000
It goes to show Mr. Dumay'’s
state of mind, Your Honor.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.724
To be convicted of obstructing
governmental administration,

17:45.862 --> 17:47.310
he has to have intended

17:47.448 --> 17:49.000
to interfere with the officer'’s
lawful duties.

17:49.137 --> 17:50.793
If he only intended
to assert his rights

17:50.931 --> 17:53.620
during an unlawful stop,
that intent did not exist.

17:54.413 --> 17:57.413
- Overruled.
- I'’ve gotten five cell phones

17:57.551 --> 17:59.793
broken by being slammed
against walls,

17:59.931 --> 18:03.448
I got a scar on my left cheek
from being thrown to the ground.

18:03.758 --> 18:05.655
- Anything else?
- My time.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.724
I gotta build
an extra 30-45 minutes

18:07.862 --> 18:10.620
just to get where I'’m going,
just in case I get stopped.

18:10.758 --> 18:13.793
And that'’s not even enough time.
Last time I was stopped,

18:13.931 --> 18:17.000
I was late for a job interview
and I didn'’t get hired.

18:18.172 --> 18:21.551
It just messes with you.
All I want is to be able

18:21.689 --> 18:26.655
to walk down the street in peace
in my neighborhood, in my city.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.034
Thank you, Mr. Dumay.

18:38.689 --> 18:40.034
Mr. Dumay, you said you did not

18:40.172 --> 18:42.758
cooperate because you were tired
of being stopped,

18:42.896 --> 18:44.103
- is that correct?
- Yes.

18:44.241 --> 18:45.689
- So you were angry.
- Yes.

18:45.827 --> 18:47.413
You didn'’t want the officer
to search you.

18:47.551 --> 18:49.172
I wanted to be treated
with respect.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.655
If he treated you with respect
you would have cooperated?

18:51.793 --> 18:53.344
Maybe, I don't know.

18:53.482 --> 18:56.482
Your Honor, being tired
of being stopped isn'’t a defense

18:56.620 --> 18:58.620
to obstructing governmental
administration.

18:58.758 --> 19:00.482
It is if the stop was unlawful.

19:00.862 --> 19:03.931
Which is why, again, we need
a ruling on the subpoena.

19:05.793 --> 19:08.344
You'’ll have my decision soon,
Mr. Riggs.

19:12.724 --> 19:14.310
Why is he putting us off?

19:14.448 --> 19:16.827
He wants to give it to us.
But he knows if he does,

19:16.965 --> 19:19.068
he'’ll have the Chief Judge
banging on his door.

19:19.206 --> 19:22.034
The Chief of Police
was already banging on hers.

19:22.586 --> 19:27.379
- Which way he'’s gonna go?
- Honestly, I have no idea.

19:30.413 --> 19:32.275
I mean,
look at these activities!

19:32.413 --> 19:35.000
"“Mineral forging
for mindfulness,

19:35.275 --> 19:36.896
quantum consciousness..."”

19:37.034 --> 19:40.000
Okay, wait.
"“Floating meditation.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.413
Watch stress, tension and worry
dissipate

19:42.551 --> 19:44.758
as you flow weightlessly
in our silk hammocks

19:44.896 --> 19:48.482
and experience the serene
vibrations of healing crystals"”.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.793
Hold on!
"“May cause motion sickness"”.

19:53.206 --> 19:56.172
Well, they have drumming
and tightrope walking.

19:56.310 --> 19:59.482
- That could be fun.
- Hold on! Horse-painting?

20:00.206 --> 20:02.965
They'’re painting the side
of an actual horse?

20:03.103 --> 20:04.862
- Okay, that'’s stupid.
- Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.793
Uh, but keep an open mind.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.965
Why, so I can work
with bees in an apiary?

20:09.103 --> 20:11.482
No, there could be some
fun stuff here, you know?

20:12.413 --> 20:16.586
Okay. Okay.
Look, Brazilian martial arts!

20:17.034 --> 20:20.379
Martini master class... now
I can get behind those things!

20:22.724 --> 20:25.758
I have to say,
this place is relaxing.

20:33.758 --> 20:35.344
NYPD doesn'’t want to set
a precedent

20:35.482 --> 20:38.551
for releasing this data.
So I'’m offering your guy an ACD.

20:39.448 --> 20:41.137
Interesting.

20:44.379 --> 20:47.655
Take the deal before judge rules
or it'’s off the table.

20:53.137 --> 20:54.965
They don'’t want the judge
to sign this subpoena,

20:55.103 --> 20:56.758
so they'’ve made an offer.

20:57.344 --> 20:58.896
They'’ll dismiss the charges
after six months,

20:59.034 --> 21:00.413
as long as you don'’t
get arrested again.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.310
So I gotta act like a good
little nigga

21:02.448 --> 21:05.137
- anytime they stop me, huh?
- That'd be a fair assumption.

21:05.275 --> 21:07.724
- What d'’you think?
- I think the DA'’s seen the data

21:07.862 --> 21:09.965
and they know they don'’t have
a pot to piss in.

21:10.103 --> 21:14.379
I think they'’re running scared
and I'’d love to hem that cop up.

21:14.896 --> 21:16.862
- Then that'’s what we do.
- Aight.

21:33.482 --> 21:36.862
Okay. Really, hon, why don'’t
you just do me from behind, OK?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.931
I'’ve got to get home.

21:39.379 --> 21:41.655
- What'’s wrong?
- Nothing.

21:41.793 --> 21:45.724
- I'’m fine.
- Is it the hotel room?

21:46.620 --> 21:48.827
I know, it'’s a little
too clandestine, isn'’t it?

21:48.965 --> 21:52.137
No, it'’s... a nice room.

21:55.379 --> 21:57.724
How about you and I
get an apartment together?

21:58.448 --> 22:01.344
What?! No!

22:02.413 --> 22:03.931
No.

22:05.896 --> 22:07.689
How are we going to take this
to the next level?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.586
Next level? Honey, this is the
only level you'’re gonna get.

22:11.655 --> 22:14.379
I risked my career for you.
I covered for you.

22:14.517 --> 22:16.344
You want to blackmail me
into--

22:17.344 --> 22:20.862
Tracy. I love you.

22:21.965 --> 22:25.241
Don'’t say that.
Don'’t ever say that.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.862
I'’ve got to go.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.655
The last step before we close
our dream catcher is the beads.

22:32.793 --> 22:34.275
Now, as you reach for the beads,

22:34.413 --> 22:37.103
let'’s all offer a silent prayer
to Grandmother.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.724
Glorious Grandmother,
Diwa spirit,

22:39.862 --> 22:43.896
guide me toward healing my body
and catching my dreams.

22:44.137 --> 22:46.551
Just three Not-guilty'’s
in a row, please.

22:46.689 --> 22:49.310
Now, let'’s open our eyes
and weave with wonder.

22:50.310 --> 22:55.310
- Thank you, Grandmother.
- Yeah, thank you, Grandmother.

22:56.310 --> 22:58.793
- Yours is very beautiful.
- Thank you.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.413
Oh, my God!
You'’re Bennet Thompson.

23:06.172 --> 23:08.275
I'’ve read all of your books.

23:08.413 --> 23:11.206
Thank you, Younesse.
That'’s very flattering.

23:11.931 --> 23:13.827
Oh, I just saw on Twitter
you got engaged!

23:13.965 --> 23:18.275
This must be your fiancée.
Is it Ashley? Or Alison?

23:20.034 --> 23:22.172
No, actually,
this is my sister.

23:23.413 --> 23:25.344
It'’s nice to meet you.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.482
Nice to meet you too.

23:29.344 --> 23:32.896
I'’ve considered the defense'’s
motion for a subpoena,

23:33.034 --> 23:35.172
and while I am sensitive
to the issues,

23:35.310 --> 23:37.344
I find that the forms
the officer filled out

23:37.482 --> 23:41.034
for other stops
have little bearing on this one.

23:41.758 --> 23:44.034
The motion for the
stop-and-frisk data is denied.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.000
Judge, you can'’t let these cops
continue to get away with this!

23:47.137 --> 23:49.551
I'’m sorry, Counselor.
This just isn'’t the right forum.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.172
They roam around
black communities

23:51.310 --> 23:52.896
- like an occupying force--
- I gave you my decision.

23:53.034 --> 23:54.586
They do whatever the hell
they want!

23:54.724 --> 23:56.758
- Counselor, stop talking!
- That cop stopped my client

23:56.896 --> 23:58.310
for no other reason
than he'’s black!

23:58.448 --> 24:00.310
You know it, I know it,
and she knows it.

24:00.448 --> 24:03.827
Mr. Riggs!
I have given you my decision.

24:03.965 --> 24:06.655
The forms are not relevant.

24:08.758 --> 24:11.482
Now, how would you like
to proceed?

24:12.275 --> 24:15.931
We need a continuance so I can
secure a witness, Your Honor.

24:16.068 --> 24:17.344
What witness?

24:17.482 --> 24:18.655
I don'’t owe you a heads-up
on our witnesses.

24:18.793 --> 24:20.206
Now, now, let'’s keep it civil.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.931
The case is continued
until tomorrow.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.827
- Who'’s the witness?
- We don'’t have a witness.

24:40.965 --> 24:43.517
Charlie, I want a witness too,
but we can'’t lie to the court.

24:43.655 --> 24:46.793
Were you even listening?
Everybody'’s lying.

24:47.241 --> 24:48.965
Nobody cares!

24:49.931 --> 24:52.517
Damn it! I just want to
take his face and--

24:53.413 --> 24:56.620
You talking'’ about Judge Adler,
Nasah, or the cop?

24:56.758 --> 24:58.241
All of them.

24:58.379 --> 25:00.310
Honey, you knew you weren'’t
gonna get that subpoena!

25:00.448 --> 25:02.586
'‘Cause if you'’d got it, we'’d
all subpoena them at every stop.

25:02.724 --> 25:04.931
Adler would have NYPD
up his old, wrinkly ass.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.448
Yeah, yeah.

25:06.586 --> 25:08.517
I know this one feels personal,
but it'’s not.

25:08.655 --> 25:10.827
It damn sure felt personal
when they had me face-down

25:10.965 --> 25:13.310
on that cop car with my hands
cuffed behind my back.

25:13.448 --> 25:16.241
And I'’m sure it feels pretty
damn personal to Marcus, too.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.689
He was stopped by
that particular cop three times.

25:18.827 --> 25:22.344
But it'’s not personal to them,
which gives them the advantage.

25:22.482 --> 25:24.310
Honey, you have to take
your emotions out of it.

25:24.448 --> 25:26.344
I'’m starting to think we'’re
never gonna get these guys,

25:26.482 --> 25:29.068
- unless we get them on tape.
- What if we already have?

25:29.862 --> 25:31.689
This cop has stopped Marcus
numerous times,

25:31.827 --> 25:34.965
so he'’s probably stopped a lot
of people more than once.

25:35.103 --> 25:36.655
What if there'’s a video
of one of those stops

25:36.793 --> 25:39.310
just waiting for the opportunity
to be put to good use?

25:39.448 --> 25:41.275
But how are we going to find out
if there'’s a tape?

25:41.413 --> 25:43.137
Ride through the neighborhood
with a bullhorn?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.517
Sort of.

25:46.862 --> 25:49.620
I'’m starting not to
hate her as much.

25:53.068 --> 25:55.448
- Gwen!
- Your sister?

25:55.586 --> 25:57.758
- Gwen!
- Your sister?!

25:57.896 --> 25:59.758
Look, I panic
when they recognize me!

25:59.896 --> 26:01.827
Who do you think you are?
Stephen King?

26:01.965 --> 26:04.793
- Who cares who recognizes you?
- What was I supposed to say?

26:04.931 --> 26:06.931
Yes, this is Alison?
Or no, this is not my fiancée,

26:07.068 --> 26:09.379
this is woman I cheated on her
while she gave us 30 days?

26:09.517 --> 26:11.413
Who cares?

26:12.517 --> 26:15.793
Hey! I'’m boning the writer
Bennet Thompson for 30 days

26:15.931 --> 26:17.724
and his fiancée, Alison,
knows it!

26:17.862 --> 26:19.000
- Stop!
- Get off me!

26:19.137 --> 26:21.034
Look, I'’m sorry, okay?

26:21.172 --> 26:22.862
I'’m a public figure.
What was I supposed to do?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.586
I mean, we never got sat down
and got our story straight.

26:24.724 --> 26:27.172
We do not need a story.
It is simple.

26:27.310 --> 26:30.827
- Are we here together or not?
- Yes. We are.

26:31.551 --> 26:34.137
But I spent an entire life
with Alison,

26:34.275 --> 26:35.862
and until you came back into
the picture,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.620
I was going to spend the rest
of my life with her.

26:37.758 --> 26:41.862
I just can'’t press a button
and erase all of that.

26:47.827 --> 26:51.172
So where does that leave me?

26:51.827 --> 26:54.000
Here.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.103
Now.

26:58.379 --> 26:59.827
With me.

27:02.827 --> 27:04.724
Like a sister?

27:05.931 --> 27:07.413
Yes.

27:08.068 --> 27:13.482
Like a very...
very hot "sistah".

27:17.379 --> 27:19.758
You heard me say "sistah",
right?

27:20.724 --> 27:23.034
Oh, so this was all just
a vowel problem?

27:23.172 --> 27:28.517
Yes. Vowel problem.
Those damn vowels!

27:33.103 --> 27:34.655
Hey!

27:34.793 --> 27:37.344
This is Charlie Riggs with
the Defendants'’ Association.

27:37.482 --> 27:41.103
And I'’m looking for people.
In particular black folks,

27:41.241 --> 27:44.172
- who--
- Cut, cut!

27:44.310 --> 27:47.379
Cut? You ain'’t Ava DuVernay!
You ain'’t directing my video!

27:47.517 --> 27:49.724
Well, someone has to.
That was terrible.

27:49.862 --> 27:51.275
What happened to making love
to the camera?

27:51.413 --> 27:53.482
You just...
blew chunks all over it.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.241
Really helpful, Trace.

27:55.379 --> 27:57.827
Okay, I took a public speaking
class once, and they taught us

27:57.965 --> 27:59.965
that it helps to have
a mental image of someone

28:00.103 --> 28:01.862
and pretend you'’re speaking
to them.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.965
So, I'’ll just stand behind
the laptop and you can pretend

28:05.103 --> 28:08.655
- you'’re speaking to me.
- Okay.

28:14.620 --> 28:15.862
Hey, what'’s up?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.137
This is Charlie Riggs
and I'’m a lawyer,

28:18.275 --> 28:19.724
defending a young brother
that'’s tired

28:19.862 --> 28:22.379
of getting stopped and frisked
by this guy.

28:22.689 --> 28:25.827
If you have video proof
of him messing with you,

28:25.965 --> 28:28.137
or someone else,
I could really use it.

28:28.275 --> 28:32.413
Please share it with the hashtag
#nothinginmypockets.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.724
- Could be worse.
- Could be worse?

28:34.862 --> 28:38.000
- I was Denzeling that shit!
- Okay, Denzel, calm down.

28:38.137 --> 28:40.965
Now, how are we going to
get this out there?

28:41.103 --> 28:42.413
What about Bennet?

28:42.551 --> 28:44.827
He has, like, 200,000
followers on Twitter.

28:44.965 --> 28:46.482
- You want me to call Gwen?
- Where is she?

28:46.620 --> 28:50.206
- With Bennet.
- No, I'’ll call her.

28:54.793 --> 28:56.758
Good luck, sugar.

29:07.655 --> 29:09.103
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey!

29:09.241 --> 29:11.689
- Where you at?
- At the Belandini.

29:11.827 --> 29:13.551
- What'’s that?
- You wouldn'’t believe it.

29:13.689 --> 29:17.758
It'’s like a psych ward
for the granola crowd.

29:17.896 --> 29:19.931
Oh.

29:20.137 --> 29:24.655
About the other night...
I was out of line.

29:25.482 --> 29:28.275
No, I... I should have
never dragged you

29:28.413 --> 29:30.689
to that whack-ass wedding shower
in the first place.

29:30.827 --> 29:33.103
No. What you do
and who you do it with,

29:33.241 --> 29:34.517
that'’s your business.

29:34.655 --> 29:36.137
Yeah, but our friendship
is important to me.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.620
No worries.

29:38.655 --> 29:40.448
Friends to the end, right?

29:41.517 --> 29:43.862
So, listen, I can'’t really talk
right now, '‘cause--

29:44.000 --> 29:45.655
Well, just, I need a favor.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.034
I put together a little video
trying to hustle up black men

29:49.172 --> 29:50.827
that have been stopped
by this one cop,

29:50.965 --> 29:52.965
using the hashtag
#nothinginmypockets.

29:53.103 --> 29:54.517
Ooh, I like it.

29:54.655 --> 29:56.034
But, I need somebody
with a huge following,

29:56.172 --> 29:59.517
so that we can get
the video to go wide.

29:59.655 --> 30:01.517
You think Bennet
would do me a solid?

30:01.655 --> 30:04.586
I don'’t see why not.
Hold on, you can ask him.

30:04.724 --> 30:06.310
- Bennet!
- Yeah.

30:06.448 --> 30:08.344
Charlie has a question.

30:12.275 --> 30:14.689
Hey, Charlie, what'’s up?

30:18.068 --> 30:20.310
Right.

30:20.655 --> 30:23.206
Good.
That I can make work.

30:23.344 --> 30:24.793
I'’ll text you my publicist'’s
number

30:24.931 --> 30:28.344
and she'’ll take it from there.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.172
Waiting on your
DateMatcher date?

30:32.310 --> 30:34.827
Excuse me?
I'’m not on DateMatcher.

30:34.965 --> 30:36.103
Oh, you'’re just on
The Mate, then.

30:36.241 --> 30:38.517
Aren'’t you the nosy bartender?

30:38.655 --> 30:40.620
- No, I'’m Derek.
- Tracy.

30:40.758 --> 30:44.172
No ring. With my luck,
you'’re either gay and/or taken.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.793
Neither.
So, what'’s your pleasure?

30:46.931 --> 30:51.103
If we'’re talking about a drink,
vodka soda, splash of cran.

30:52.172 --> 30:55.448
Alright, F-you then.
Bourbon, straight up.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.137
Now we'’re getting somewhere.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.413
So, which is it?
Your place or mine?

31:03.827 --> 31:05.586
Whichever'’s closer.

31:10.862 --> 31:12.344
How did you snag
a job at Snapchat?

31:12.482 --> 31:14.000
Oh, they recruited me!

31:14.137 --> 31:16.448
I know! They flew me out to L.A.
four times for interviews.

31:16.586 --> 31:18.275
Did he tell you how much
he'’s banking?

31:18.413 --> 31:20.379
Oh, are we seriously
talking money at the table?

31:20.517 --> 31:22.000
Yeah.

31:22.137 --> 31:25.551
- That much?
- Yeah, well. Greed is good.

31:25.689 --> 31:27.586
So, how'’s the Defender
Association?

31:27.724 --> 31:29.241
It'’s definitely an adjustment.

31:29.379 --> 31:31.551
I have, like, 100 misdemeanor
cases at any one time,

31:31.689 --> 31:33.172
and I'’ve just had
my first trial.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.517
What? Lucky you!

31:34.655 --> 31:36.551
I don'’t get
any trial experience.

31:36.689 --> 31:39.448
But, I am getting
a bigger office.

31:39.586 --> 31:40.724
You are?

31:40.862 --> 31:42.241
I spearheaded
the document review

31:42.379 --> 31:44.275
on one of our biggest
pharmaceutical cases...

31:44.413 --> 31:46.103
The partners sat me down
last week.

31:46.241 --> 31:48.275
People work at the Association
for years before they even

31:48.413 --> 31:49.965
get their own office.

31:50.103 --> 31:52.000
You'’re just constantly hustling
trying to get your client

31:52.137 --> 31:53.551
- a fair deal.
- Fair?

31:53.689 --> 31:55.241
- They'’re criminals.
- You'’re wrong.

31:55.379 --> 31:57.068
I just defended a guy
that got stopped by the cops

31:57.206 --> 31:59.448
40 times
just because he'’s black.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.413
And a woman who went to jail
because she bounced a check

32:01.551 --> 32:04.068
for 356 dollars. She has kids.

32:04.206 --> 32:05.827
Van, you need to
get out of that place.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.344
Yeah, I mean,
if you want to do criminal,

32:07.482 --> 32:09.793
you could just do white-collar
at ColdWell.

32:09.931 --> 32:13.724
Why work in gutter,
if you can work in penthouse?

32:21.827 --> 32:24.137
For tonight'’s main course,
we will be preparing

32:24.275 --> 32:27.724
sticky peanut cauliflower wings.

32:28.137 --> 32:29.517
Oh, hold on, sorry.

32:29.655 --> 32:31.931
Cauliflowers have wings,
or do you actually mean chicken?

32:32.068 --> 32:34.655
Ah, no.
We just call them wings.

32:36.241 --> 32:37.931
So it'’s... cauliflower?

32:38.344 --> 32:41.517
Right. The idea of vegan food.

32:43.275 --> 32:44.965
You signed us up
for the vegan class?

32:45.103 --> 32:46.620
I didn'’t know
it was straight up.

32:46.758 --> 32:49.068
She was second runner-up on
Competitive Kitchen 2015.

32:49.206 --> 32:50.827
Sorry, there'’s been
a misunderstanding.

32:50.965 --> 32:53.137
I thought we were making
actual food.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.620
Don'’t save the leftovers.

33:02.931 --> 33:04.931
Miss Hastings,
call your next witness.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.206
At this time, the Defense
would like to call everyone

33:07.344 --> 33:09.310
who'’s been stopped and frisked
by Officer Porter

33:09.448 --> 33:10.758
in the last six months.

33:14.241 --> 33:16.000
Objection!
What is going on?

33:16.137 --> 33:18.000
These men were all stopped
by Officer Porter

33:18.137 --> 33:20.275
for having bulges,
which turned out to be keys,

33:20.413 --> 33:23.034
phones, wallets,
cigarettes, tissues...

33:23.172 --> 33:26.931
If any of you were subsequently
arrested, raise your hand.

33:27.448 --> 33:29.344
And these are just the people
we know about.

33:29.482 --> 33:32.931
Your Honor, the visual aids
are inappropriate.

33:33.068 --> 33:35.275
And, yet, effective.

33:35.620 --> 33:38.344
Officer Porter does appear to be
a little trigger-happy

33:38.482 --> 33:40.172
- on the stop-and-frisk.
- This is crazy!

33:40.310 --> 33:42.620
How do we know what each one
of these men is saying is true?

33:42.758 --> 33:44.448
Are we going to put
all 40 of them on the stand,

33:44.586 --> 33:47.068
- so I can cross-examine them?
- I do also have 20 videos.

33:47.206 --> 33:48.793
I'’d be happy
to play them for you.

33:48.931 --> 33:51.413
I don'’t think that
will be necessary.

33:52.310 --> 33:53.862
Do you have a motion,
Miss Hastings?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.482
I move for a directed verdict
of "“Not guilty"”.

33:57.068 --> 34:00.793
- Granted.
- Yes! Yes! I knew it!

34:02.862 --> 34:05.000
- Thank you.
- Good work.

34:07.724 --> 34:10.896
I suggest you give these
to the Serge'’ over at the 2-5

34:11.034 --> 34:13.241
and he can hand them out
at roll call tomorrow.

34:13.379 --> 34:15.793
Any officer that illegally
stops Mr. Dumay again

34:15.931 --> 34:18.827
is going to be joined to the
civil suit he's about to file

34:18.965 --> 34:22.172
against the City
and the police department.

34:29.413 --> 34:31.482
Gwen!

34:31.724 --> 34:34.000
- I don'’t want to talk.
- We don'’t have to!

34:34.241 --> 34:36.241
I understand,
but I'’m not going anywhere.

34:36.551 --> 34:38.655
How were the vomit
peanut non-wings?

34:38.793 --> 34:40.275
Not nearly as good as
if I'’d have been

34:40.413 --> 34:42.586
- sharing them with you.
- You know this is bullshit.

34:42.724 --> 34:44.241
- Which part?
- All of it.

34:44.379 --> 34:47.206
This whole place is ridiculous.
It'’s so Alison.

34:47.344 --> 34:49.206
And that'’s the thing:
I'’m not her.

34:49.344 --> 34:52.620
I'’m not vegan, or perfect,
or any of that.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.068
- And you can'’t just slot me in.
- I'’m sorry! Okay?

34:55.206 --> 34:56.793
I thought all women
kind of liked this place.

34:56.931 --> 34:58.517
- I didn'’t think it through.
- What are we doing?

34:58.655 --> 35:00.344
- I mean, really.
- We'’re trying.

35:00.482 --> 35:02.137
You'’re trying. It'’s like
I'’m a new pair of sneakers,

35:02.275 --> 35:04.000
or a new vegetable,
and you'’re experimenting.

35:04.137 --> 35:06.034
Which makes me the experiment.
And I feel like

35:06.172 --> 35:08.137
I'’m constantly auditioning,
and that sucks!

35:08.275 --> 35:12.206
You don'’t have to audition.
You got the part!

35:12.551 --> 35:16.103
Can we just...
take a second and reset?

35:16.413 --> 35:20.310
- Hey, we still have 28 days!
- No, you have 28 days!

35:20.448 --> 35:22.758
You get to just sit there
and decide who you love,

35:22.896 --> 35:24.827
and I got nothing.
You have all the power.

35:24.965 --> 35:27.206
Hell, Alison, has all the power.
She'’s no dumbass.

35:27.344 --> 35:29.172
She'’s the one who'’s setting
the timetable,

35:29.310 --> 35:30.931
and giving you "“the choice"”.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.758
And she'’s turning me into
a frickin'’ performing seal.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.275
And this is you being
a performing seal?

35:34.413 --> 35:36.137
Yes!
And I hate this shit.

35:36.275 --> 35:39.000
But I'’m running around here
pretending to dream-catching

35:39.137 --> 35:41.758
and I'’m turning summersaults
and barking for fish!

35:41.896 --> 35:44.827
Gwen! You don'’t have
to prove anything.

35:44.965 --> 35:48.482
I want you
just the way you are.

35:49.310 --> 35:52.482
And to prove it... Come in!

36:08.931 --> 36:11.206
Aw! Chicken waffles!

36:11.344 --> 36:14.931
To be honest, I kind of
really hate vegan food.

36:15.068 --> 36:17.379
- And Flamebolt!
- You can say what you want

36:17.517 --> 36:19.034
about the activities
in this place,

36:19.172 --> 36:22.448
but they really do let you
do anything. Have some.

36:26.482 --> 36:31.724
Oh! Goodbye, Mudra meditation,
hello, New York City!

36:32.448 --> 36:36.000
Do me a favor and get the map
out the glove compartment.

36:36.137 --> 36:38.482
- Who uses paper maps anymore?
- Call me retro,

36:38.620 --> 36:40.344
but I have a shortcut
and I want to make sure.

36:40.482 --> 36:42.034
There'’s no map,
but what are these?

36:42.172 --> 36:43.965
I have an apartment.
I have mine; those are yours.

36:45.034 --> 36:46.724
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

36:46.862 --> 36:49.827
Let'’s spend some real time
together, let'’s make go at this.

36:55.103 --> 36:56.206
- Really?
- Yes.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.965
- You want to drive?
- Hell yeah!

37:03.862 --> 37:05.482
- Thank you.
- You'’re welcome.

37:14.137 --> 37:15.310
Ooh.

37:15.448 --> 37:18.137
- I forgot this is stick shift.
- Mm-hmm.

37:20.448 --> 37:22.172
I think I'’ve got this.

37:26.862 --> 37:28.448
- Hey!
- Sorry! Sorry.

37:28.586 --> 37:30.724
- You want me to take over?
- No, I don'’t think so.

37:30.862 --> 37:32.931
I think I got it.

37:33.068 --> 37:36.862
- Gwen!
- I'’m just messing with you.

37:49.551 --> 37:51.206
Tracy.

37:52.344 --> 37:55.413
- Is... something wrong?
- What I'’m about to say

37:55.551 --> 37:57.275
isn'’t the beginning
of a discussion,

37:57.413 --> 37:59.379
but the announcement
of a decision.

37:59.827 --> 38:02.137
- Okay.
- It'’s been fun.

38:02.275 --> 38:04.586
- But?
- But this is where I leave you.

38:07.758 --> 38:10.551
Why? I'’m a free man.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.758
We don'’t have to hide anymore.
We can be together in public.

38:13.896 --> 38:17.206
What did you think this was?
Dating? Going steady?

38:17.344 --> 38:21.275
Tracy, I left my wife for you.
We'’ve got something going.

38:21.413 --> 38:24.827
No. We had sex going.
Lots of great, kinky sex.

38:24.965 --> 38:26.620
But, if you thought that this
was anything more

38:26.758 --> 38:28.517
than mutual getting off,
or if you thought that

38:28.655 --> 38:31.724
giving me a pearl necklace
meant we had a relationship,

38:31.862 --> 38:33.206
that'’s on you.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.620
So you think you can
just end this, hmm?

38:39.103 --> 38:42.620
- Like that.
- Sugar, I just did.

38:56.758 --> 39:01.172
Can I get a shot of whisky?
I need to wash this day away.

39:01.310 --> 39:03.034
One more here too, please.

39:03.172 --> 39:05.137
Looks like somebody unclenched.

39:05.275 --> 39:07.482
Do not come for me,
unless I send for you.

39:07.620 --> 39:11.413
Well, well... look at that.
Bambi finally grew a backbone.

39:12.275 --> 39:14.172
Why are you depressed?
You won.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.896
- Well, it'’s my friends.
- Never mind, two more.

39:18.034 --> 39:21.000
- Make that three.
- What is with you two?

39:21.137 --> 39:22.758
You'’d think you just got
hammered in court,

39:22.896 --> 39:24.827
instead of making that cop look
like the asshole he is!

39:24.965 --> 39:26.965
- Where'’s Gwen?
- Catskills!

39:27.103 --> 39:28.862
Good for her!

39:30.068 --> 39:31.206
- Isn'’t it?
- Vanessa, hon,

39:31.344 --> 39:32.896
- do you have a Hamilton?
- Yeah.

39:33.034 --> 39:34.482
- Good, go to the--
- Feed the jukebox.

39:34.620 --> 39:37.068
Okay, new rule:
my money, my picks.

39:37.206 --> 39:38.344
Uh-oh.

39:39.758 --> 39:42.689
Don'’t give up.
Last man standing wins.

39:43.793 --> 39:47.103
What are you talking about?
Gwen and I are just friends.

39:48.034 --> 39:49.241
Okay.

39:55.482 --> 39:58.000
- Oh, no, please, no!
- Really, Vanessa?

39:59.344 --> 40:01.931
I told you not to let her pick!
Or dance.

40:05.551 --> 40:09.551
- Stop the madness.
- Yeah. I had the same idea.

40:10.379 --> 40:13.379
Holy shit!
Tessa? Campinelli?

40:14.137 --> 40:16.137
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

40:16.275 --> 40:17.827
No, no, I'’m not!

40:17.965 --> 40:19.379
I'’ve been looking all over
for you! You'’re Tessa!

40:19.517 --> 40:21.034
Uh-huh. I must just have
one of those faces.

40:36.241 --> 40:37.827
Next time on In Contempt...

40:37.965 --> 40:39.724
This guy burned
his girlfriend alive,

40:39.862 --> 40:41.551
- and then watched her die!
- Allegedly.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.103
As your new supervisor,

40:43.241 --> 40:45.034
it'’s my duty to prepare
your performance review.

40:45.172 --> 40:46.586
Tom usually
just lets me write it

40:46.724 --> 40:48.965
- and then he signs.
- New sheriff in town.

40:49.103 --> 40:50.931
Bennet and I are sort
of moving in together.

40:51.068 --> 40:53.586
Wow, Bennet! This is great!

40:53.724 --> 40:55.689
We are supposed
to be fighting for justice!

40:55.827 --> 40:58.379
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

40:58.517 --> 41:00.758
- Take me off this trial.
- Easy, now.

41:00.896 --> 41:02.620
You'’re the one
who wanted more serious cases.

41:02.758 --> 41:06.758
I can'’t do this. Please.
I'’m asking you as my supervisor.
