01:15.988 --> 01:18.226
Let's go.

01:20.501 --> 01:22.354
Where
you going, bitch?

01:22.356 --> 01:23.890
Don't leave me!

01:23.892 --> 01:24.915
Don't leave me!

01:46.772 --> 01:49.554
One more strike, Quintana,
we lock your ass up for good.

01:49.556 --> 01:51.154
You got yourself a record, boy.

01:51.156 --> 01:54.386
Most recent... breaking and
entering, stealing a car,

01:54.388 --> 01:57.749
disturbing the peace,
indecent exposure.

02:05.141 --> 02:08.211
Wow, that's big.

02:08.213 --> 02:11.122
I have to have
special underwear, man.

02:11.124 --> 02:12.946
Really?

02:12.948 --> 02:14.194
Yeah.

02:14.196 --> 02:16.018
But size ain't everything.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.003
Don't make you a man.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.923
For that you need balls.

02:19.925 --> 02:21.298
Bullshit.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.122
Six months at Chino
for taking a piss.

02:23.124 --> 02:26.482
Sometimes folks overreact.

02:26.484 --> 02:28.339
In any event, you
didn't do it again.

02:28.341 --> 02:29.202
Hell no.

02:29.204 --> 02:30.322
I ain't no sex offender.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.794
Served your time, boy.

02:31.796 --> 02:33.459
And we don't forget
what you did, Quintana,

02:33.461 --> 02:35.859
helping the Black Sheep
win a correctional state

02:35.861 --> 02:38.835
bowling championship.

02:38.837 --> 02:40.083
We don't forget.

02:40.085 --> 02:42.802
That last strike of
yours was for the ages.

02:42.804 --> 02:44.755
I chopped his ass up.

02:44.757 --> 02:52.275
I've never seen any one lick a
ball before you throw a strike.

02:52.277 --> 02:53.938
That's my style.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.219
Keep on bowling, boy.

03:27.029 --> 03:27.987
I'll see you, Castro.

03:38.613 --> 03:40.020
We're gonna miss you, Quintana.

03:49.556 --> 03:51.538
You look good.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.684
I look like a
million bucks, man.

03:56.949 --> 03:57.651
Woo!

03:57.653 --> 03:59.731
Whoa, man!

03:59.733 --> 04:00.499
Let's roll.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.611
Where we going?

04:02.613 --> 04:03.954
I'm not into dating.

04:03.956 --> 04:05.043
You like me?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.451
We get it on.

04:06.453 --> 04:08.082
But don't let me have
to feed you first.

04:15.668 --> 04:17.553
Put your fingers
through it, just like that.

04:17.555 --> 04:18.994
Yes.
Mm.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.403
I just think it gives it
so much more movement here.

04:20.404 --> 04:21.874
Yeah, I love it.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.675
There's a lot
of play at the bottom, right?

04:22.677 --> 04:23.698
Yeah.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.562
How we doing over here?
Good?

04:24.564 --> 04:25.522
Grateful.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.379
I used to have blond hair.

04:27.381 --> 04:28.114
Really?

04:28.116 --> 04:30.099
Bullshit, man!

04:30.101 --> 04:31.890
can say that shit.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.970
I used to have blond
hair, like they got over.

04:33.972 --> 04:34.642
Huh?

04:34.644 --> 04:35.922
Oh, shit.

04:35.924 --> 04:36.786
Hey, man.

04:38.516 --> 04:40.819
Going over there?

04:40.821 --> 04:42.546
What a honey, huh?

04:42.548 --> 04:44.851
Orange and shit, huh?

04:44.853 --> 04:46.546
Still warm.

04:46.548 --> 04:50.066
It's been a long time since
I took the wheel, man.

04:50.068 --> 04:50.515
Huh?

04:50.517 --> 04:51.125
Woo.

04:56.469 --> 04:57.459
We're on parole.

04:57.461 --> 05:00.915
I know you got a screwdriver.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.899
Your own muscle car, man.

05:02.901 --> 05:05.043
How's that for a
smooth ride, huh?

05:05.045 --> 05:06.867
Feel that torque, man!

05:06.869 --> 05:08.306
Fucking poetry, man!

05:08.308 --> 05:09.298
Ah!

05:09.300 --> 05:12.339
Hey... where we going, anyway?

05:12.341 --> 05:14.098
I should drop in
on the old lady.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.026
Your... your mom?

05:15.028 --> 05:15.986
Now?

05:15.988 --> 05:17.010
I mean, one of these days.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.066
You know.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.251
What is she like?

05:19.253 --> 05:19.986
Mommy?

05:19.988 --> 05:20.405
Yeah.

05:42.389 --> 05:43.507
Sh! Sh! Sh!

05:43.509 --> 05:45.106
What is it?

05:47.957 --> 05:48.660
It's me, Mommy.

05:52.628 --> 05:53.045
Jesus.

05:55.764 --> 05:59.154
I'd like you to meet my moms.

05:59.156 --> 05:59.573
Evening, ma'am.

06:04.404 --> 06:06.066
Is he your friend?

06:06.068 --> 06:09.267
Yeah, Petey.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.354
OK, Mom.

06:10.356 --> 06:11.187
Let's go.

06:11.189 --> 06:13.042
On your feet, Pops.

06:13.044 --> 06:15.219
On your feet, man.

06:15.221 --> 06:16.915
Still on the game, huh?

06:16.917 --> 06:18.450
At your age, huh?

06:18.452 --> 06:19.059
Uh-huh.

06:19.061 --> 06:19.923
, Mommy.

06:19.925 --> 06:21.522
You ought to be ashamed.

06:21.524 --> 06:22.450
On your feet, I said, man.

06:22.452 --> 06:23.154
Let's go.

06:23.156 --> 06:23.698
Chop, chop.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.435
I'm coming.

06:24.437 --> 06:25.299
Let's move it.

06:25.301 --> 06:25.716
Give him back his bread.

06:29.940 --> 06:30.930
What's your name, man?

06:30.932 --> 06:32.242
Frank.

06:32.244 --> 06:34.387
You from
around here, Frank?

06:34.389 --> 06:35.922
He's from up north.

06:35.924 --> 06:37.138
Mhm.

06:37.140 --> 06:39.058
It doesn't bother
you, Frank, to do

06:39.060 --> 06:41.107
the horizontal with my mother?

06:41.109 --> 06:41.842
Excuse me.

06:41.844 --> 06:42.706
I didn't know.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.403
You didn't know?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.843
You... you have sex with the
man's mother in the family bed?

06:45.845 --> 06:47.506
Hey,.

06:47.508 --> 06:52.179
Hey, man, that kind of makes
you like my old man, huh?

06:54.068 --> 06:55.315
Oh.

06:55.317 --> 06:57.075
You know... you know
shit about jail, Frank?

06:57.077 --> 06:58.866
No, not... not personally.

06:58.868 --> 07:01.683
You know what you got at
night to help you sleep?

07:01.685 --> 07:02.962
No.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.554
Tell him, Petey.

07:05.556 --> 07:07.027
Your hand.

07:07.029 --> 07:07.731
Oh.

07:08.981 --> 07:10.675
You can get your rocks
off with somebody's

07:10.677 --> 07:12.306
mama in the slammer, man.

07:13.268 --> 07:14.707
My glasses!

07:14.709 --> 07:15.667
I'm sorry.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.531
I didn't know you had a son.

07:16.533 --> 07:17.427
You didn't know, man.

07:17.429 --> 07:18.483
But now you know.

07:18.485 --> 07:21.682
She's got a son, man.

07:21.684 --> 07:23.059
Make some coffee, Mommy.

07:23.061 --> 07:25.618
And put something on decent.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.853
If there's one thing my buddy's
nuts about, it's modesty.

07:42.293 --> 07:45.716
Yeah, well, it's better
than no mother at all.

07:48.276 --> 07:49.042
That's low, man.

07:49.044 --> 07:49.875
Be polite.

07:49.877 --> 07:52.786
She's a lady.

07:52.788 --> 07:54.739
She doesn't look
much older than you.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.602
Yeah?

07:55.604 --> 07:57.811
Well, she isn't, man.

07:57.813 --> 08:01.491
Hey, wash your face
while you're in there,

08:01.493 --> 08:03.986
and take the war paint off, huh?

08:03.988 --> 08:08.371
I want to see your real
eyes, your real skin.

08:08.373 --> 08:10.035
I mean, who knows...
maybe it's the last time

08:10.037 --> 08:11.826
I'll ever see you.

08:11.828 --> 08:16.498
And here's a little something
extra to tide your ass over.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.346
Thank you.

08:19.348 --> 08:22.354
So you got out.

08:22.356 --> 08:24.146
Right.

08:24.148 --> 08:25.426
How do I look?

08:25.428 --> 08:26.386
Different?

08:26.388 --> 08:27.634
No.

08:27.636 --> 08:28.244
I don't know.

08:31.188 --> 08:34.644
You look like a kid, my kid.

08:39.155 --> 08:44.338
He always drank
like this, pinky up.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.300
Distinguished.

08:48.693 --> 08:50.643
You ever see him bowl?

08:50.645 --> 08:51.252
Couple times.

08:54.068 --> 08:57.427
This man can roll.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.189
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

09:10.836 --> 09:12.212
She smiles like ravioli, man.

09:17.076 --> 09:20.467
Wow, you guys are a
couple of real fuckheads.

09:20.469 --> 09:22.164
Aren't you a little old
to be stealing cars?

09:25.748 --> 09:26.578
Yeah, I know.

09:26.580 --> 09:27.538
Pretty nice, right?

09:27.540 --> 09:28.786
Too bad you can't afford it.

09:28.788 --> 09:29.938
See the name on the building?

09:29.940 --> 09:30.963
That's me, baby.

09:30.965 --> 09:33.266
Now put your hands up.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.154
You picked the
wrong guy, fellas.

09:35.156 --> 09:36.339
That's the third
vintage car I've

09:36.341 --> 09:37.362
had stolen in under a year.

09:37.364 --> 09:38.515
We didn't steal it.

09:38.517 --> 09:39.442
We just... we just
took it out, man.

09:39.444 --> 09:40.275
We borrowed it.

09:40.277 --> 09:41.554
We brought it back.

09:41.556 --> 09:43.122
Why don't you tell your
story to the man, OK?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.810
You never fuck with another
man's car, or his hair.

09:45.812 --> 09:46.930
Marie, you call the cops.

09:46.932 --> 09:47.666
You call them.

09:47.668 --> 09:48.946
It's your car.

09:48.948 --> 09:50.067
How about I fire your
skinny French ass, huh?

09:50.069 --> 09:51.699
Marie!

09:51.701 --> 09:53.394
Jesus!

09:53.396 --> 09:55.666
Woo!

09:56.820 --> 09:58.675
You looking good, girl.

09:58.677 --> 09:59.794
What's up with Leon?

09:59.796 --> 10:01.170
Oh, it's over.

10:02.004 --> 10:02.451
I'm sorry.

10:02.453 --> 10:03.699
I'm sorry.

10:03.701 --> 10:04.659
Is this some sort of
fucked up family reunion

10:04.661 --> 10:05.842
that we're having right now?

10:05.844 --> 10:07.155
Do you actually know this clown?

10:07.157 --> 10:08.499
Who you calling
a clown,??

10:08.501 --> 10:10.002
I thought you
were in the slammer?

10:10.004 --> 10:11.187
I just got out.

10:11.189 --> 10:12.658
So you celebrated
by stealing my car?

10:12.660 --> 10:14.643
That was the first
thing you did, fuckhead?

10:14.645 --> 10:15.730
Well...

10:15.732 --> 10:17.074
I'll make it up
to you, baby, OK?

10:17.076 --> 10:18.034
We're on prob, man!

10:18.036 --> 10:19.602
Frenchie, shut the fuck up.

10:19.604 --> 10:20.595
Hey!

10:20.597 --> 10:21.586
Watch how you talk to a lady!

10:21.588 --> 10:22.546
Asshole.

10:22.548 --> 10:23.379
Shut the fuck up.

10:23.381 --> 10:24.114
Fucking asshole!

10:24.756 --> 10:25.714
I'm sorry!

10:25.716 --> 10:27.442
Who is the hairdresser here?

10:27.444 --> 10:28.371
Who's Paul Dominic?

10:28.373 --> 10:29.554
That gun don't scare me.

10:29.556 --> 10:30.355
Jesus

10:30.357 --> 10:31.923
Cartoon gangster.

10:31.925 --> 10:34.419
You got the balls to pull
a trigger on the Jesus?

10:34.421 --> 10:35.730
I can't hack it
in the hole, man.

10:35.732 --> 10:36.850
Fuck this shit!

10:36.852 --> 10:37.810
Should have thought
of that first.

10:39.668 --> 10:41.811
Fuck!

10:41.813 --> 10:42.739
Ah!
Ah!

10:42.741 --> 10:43.858
Oh!

10:43.860 --> 10:44.595
in the ass.

10:44.597 --> 10:45.586
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

10:45.588 --> 10:46.386
That really hurts.

10:46.388 --> 10:47.314
That really... ooh!

10:47.316 --> 10:48.114
Fuck you in the ass, man!

10:48.789 --> 10:50.419
Two times, papi chulo!

10:50.421 --> 10:51.186
Whoa, man!

10:51.188 --> 10:51.634
Oh!

10:51.636 --> 10:52.531
Ow!

10:52.533 --> 10:55.762
Dude, I'm a hairdresser.

10:55.764 --> 10:58.035
Nobody fucks with
the Jesus, man!

10:58.037 --> 10:59.251
Nobody.

10:59.253 --> 11:00.339
Woo!

11:00.341 --> 11:01.203
Fine.

11:01.205 --> 11:02.067
Fucking Boricuas!

11:02.069 --> 11:03.826
Ugh, thank you, baby.

11:03.828 --> 11:04.563
Asshole.

11:04.565 --> 11:06.418
Hey, what the?

11:08.661 --> 11:09.586
Get in, Petey!

11:09.588 --> 11:10.290
Get your ass in!

11:11.573 --> 11:12.404
Oh, shit.

11:15.636 --> 11:18.034
Oh, there's blood all over me!

11:18.036 --> 11:19.443
We have to find a doctor!

11:19.445 --> 11:21.394
Where you hit?

11:21.396 --> 11:22.451
Ugh!

11:22.453 --> 11:23.794
enough to shoot him. What an
asshole!

11:23.796 --> 11:24.243
Jesus.

11:24.245 --> 11:25.618
Jesus.

11:25.620 --> 11:28.659
There's blood all over my balls!

11:28.661 --> 11:29.554
Hold tight, Petey.

11:29.556 --> 11:29.973
Hold tight.

11:32.597 --> 11:33.651
He's dead!

11:33.653 --> 11:36.243
Huh?

11:39.060 --> 11:39.571
Petey!

11:39.573 --> 11:41.043
Yeah, I'm OK.

11:41.045 --> 11:42.034
You scared the
shit out of me, Petey.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.026
, I'm bleeding.

11:43.028 --> 11:44.338
I got so much blood on my balls.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.202
Hang in there, man.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.035
That's not good.

11:46.037 --> 11:46.708
Oh, that's not good!

11:52.821 --> 11:56.308
We got to dumb
this car, change colors.

12:02.964 --> 12:04.114
Keep down.

12:04.116 --> 12:06.162
He can't hack the
sight of blood.

12:09.269 --> 12:11.890
Quintana!

12:11.892 --> 12:12.723
What's up, man?

12:12.725 --> 12:13.683
Yeah!

12:13.685 --> 12:14.962
What the fuck is going on?

12:14.964 --> 12:15.922
I thought you was in the slam?

12:15.924 --> 12:16.978
Man, I was... good behavior.

12:16.980 --> 12:17.842
Woo!

12:17.844 --> 12:18.963
They reformed your shit.

12:18.965 --> 12:20.914
A new man...
that's right, man.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.226
I need a new whip, man.

12:23.124 --> 12:23.794
Got some dough?

12:23.796 --> 12:24.754
I got something better.

12:24.756 --> 12:27.026
Marie, come over here, man.

12:27.028 --> 12:28.210
You got some scissors?

12:28.212 --> 12:29.331
Fuck yeah, I got
a pair of scissors.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.451
Yeah?

12:30.453 --> 12:31.986
Well, my lady
friend here is going

12:31.988 --> 12:35.666
to lay a cut on you that
will blow your mind, man,

12:35.668 --> 12:37.267
make you totally sexy, man.

12:37.269 --> 12:39.091
I'm already a
sexy motherfucker.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.083
Yeah.

12:40.085 --> 12:41.074
I'll make you more sexy, man.

12:41.076 --> 12:42.706
No, man.

12:42.708 --> 12:43.858
Chop his head up good.

12:43.860 --> 12:44.501
Yeah, I got it.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.330
I'll be right back.

12:51.701 --> 12:52.533
Aw, shit.

12:56.981 --> 13:00.626
Endo... endo-chronologist,
what the fuck's that mean?

13:00.628 --> 13:01.714
How am I
supposed to know?

13:01.716 --> 13:03.380
What am I, a fucking dictionary?

13:06.516 --> 13:08.789
Oh, what I need is a man
who takes care of balls!

13:17.621 --> 13:19.858
Jesus Christ!

13:19.860 --> 13:23.091
Oh, my balls!

13:35.252 --> 13:35.669
Easy.

13:39.348 --> 13:42.834
My buddy got shot
by a hairdresser.

13:42.836 --> 13:46.738
Fix him up, or I'll stick
my piece up your ass

13:46.740 --> 13:49.554
and pull the trigger.

13:49.556 --> 13:51.091
Pick.

13:51.093 --> 13:52.851
I fuck on the outside.

13:52.853 --> 13:55.314
Paul Dominic doesn't
get through the door.

13:55.316 --> 13:58.194
No hairdressers...
not at my place.

13:58.196 --> 13:59.475
I won't have it.

13:59.477 --> 14:02.451
In the bushes, in the
bedroom, on his wife's

14:02.453 --> 14:04.275
sheets, when she's
skiing, no problem.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.291
I just spread out on her bed.

14:06.293 --> 14:07.186
Easy, easy.

14:07.892 --> 14:10.066
Easy.

14:10.068 --> 14:11.187
Oh god.

14:11.189 --> 14:13.842
He's going to
need a transfusion.

14:13.844 --> 14:15.154
- I got to get some blood.
- Your wife can go.

14:15.156 --> 14:15.764
Wake her up.

14:18.741 --> 14:21.811
Ha, his apartment's
fucking choice.

14:21.813 --> 14:25.651
The bathroom... they've
got one of those douches.

14:25.653 --> 14:27.315
It's like a couch.

14:27.317 --> 14:29.491
His wife's pussy must shine.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.826
There's no reason why
she should have a stink.

14:31.828 --> 14:33.331
And the one towel...

14:33.333 --> 14:34.803
holy shit.

14:34.805 --> 14:38.802
Wiping your ass
is an experience.

14:38.804 --> 14:41.394
Thank you very much.

14:41.396 --> 14:43.666
How's his ball?

14:43.668 --> 14:45.682
The bullet pierced the
fleshy part of the thigh.

14:45.684 --> 14:49.587
A little to the left, he
would have burst a testicle.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.667
We get all the breaks, man.

14:51.669 --> 14:55.059
Hey, man, what you got in the
way of cash around here, bro?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.019
Hm?

14:56.021 --> 14:57.363
Sorry, you're out of luck.

14:57.365 --> 14:59.251
Really, huh?

14:59.253 --> 15:00.117
Howard, give him the money.

15:06.581 --> 15:08.883
That's a dumb play, Howie.

15:08.885 --> 15:17.362
What you take me
for, some

15:17.364 --> 15:20.434
You got a find lady there, man.

15:20.436 --> 15:23.314
You should treat her right.

15:23.316 --> 15:24.915
You'll need some antibiotics.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.772
Here, for your friend.

15:32.308 --> 15:34.738
I could have been a doctor.

15:34.740 --> 15:37.074
This frog
lady won't stop yapping.

15:37.076 --> 15:38.419
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.435
I feel like the underside
of a turnip green.

15:40.437 --> 15:41.554
You see?
See?

15:41.556 --> 15:42.259
Look at my hair,
motherfucking hair.

15:42.261 --> 15:43.251
Huh?

15:43.253 --> 15:44.786
What are you squawking about?

15:44.788 --> 15:45.906
Now I got to buy a hat
to cover my bald-ass head.

15:45.908 --> 15:47.251
There's a art to this shit!

15:47.253 --> 15:48.082
You look good.

15:48.084 --> 15:49.650
Yeah?

15:49.652 --> 15:54.610
Shit, I'm a sexy motherfucker.

15:54.612 --> 15:57.586
Shit, I'd fuck me too.

15:57.588 --> 15:59.667
Yeah.

15:59.669 --> 16:03.411
Guess what we're going
to lay on this hair curler.

16:03.413 --> 16:06.226
You got me.

16:06.228 --> 16:08.275
He's all hung up
on this car, right?

16:08.277 --> 16:09.682
Yeah.

16:09.684 --> 16:13.714
So we leave it on
the side of the road.

16:13.716 --> 16:14.514
You with me?

16:14.516 --> 16:15.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:15.060 --> 16:15.699
Sure.

16:15.701 --> 16:16.563
OK.

16:16.565 --> 16:18.963
The cops, they find it.

16:18.965 --> 16:21.876
And lover boy gets it
back completely intact.

16:24.501 --> 16:32.242
And he doesn't know, that fuck,
is that we have completely

16:32.244 --> 16:33.652
fucked his fucking car.

16:38.997 --> 16:43.827
I saw in through one of
the front axles, almost.

16:43.829 --> 16:50.034
One wheel is hanging by a hair
waiting to fly off on a curve,

16:50.036 --> 16:53.458
doing 90 on the
highway, just radio

16:53.460 --> 16:55.890
blasting, the hair's flying.

16:55.892 --> 16:58.387
He's just having a good time,
man, when all of a sudden,

16:58.389 --> 16:59.187
oops!

17:01.140 --> 17:02.772
Wheel flies off, man!

17:06.101 --> 17:08.595
Isn't that beautiful?

17:08.597 --> 17:09.428
Yeah, I guess.

17:32.757 --> 17:35.442
Can you get me
some gum, and some pants,

17:35.444 --> 17:40.114
and some shorts, and
smokes, and some chocolate?

17:40.116 --> 17:42.834
And gauze... get
me a lot of gauze.

17:42.836 --> 17:43.445
Anything else, sweety?

17:52.917 --> 17:55.762
Are you sure this is
where you want to be?

17:55.764 --> 17:56.914
Why not?

17:56.916 --> 17:58.546
People buy things here.

17:58.548 --> 17:59.571
You need money.

17:59.573 --> 18:00.180
Oh.

18:04.469 --> 18:06.226
You probably just
got out of jail.

18:06.228 --> 18:08.850
Whoa, mind reader, huh?

18:08.852 --> 18:09.874
Your first paycheck.

18:09.876 --> 18:10.419
No.

18:10.421 --> 18:11.314
No, I got a...

18:11.316 --> 18:12.884
I got a rich lady, man.

18:16.661 --> 18:17.619
Oh yeah, man.

18:17.621 --> 18:18.706
She can't get enough of me.

18:18.708 --> 18:19.602
Congratulations.

18:19.604 --> 18:20.562
Yeah.

18:20.564 --> 18:22.386
You don't need that badge.

18:22.388 --> 18:25.362
Your cologne gives you away.

18:25.364 --> 18:26.163
You're lucky.

18:26.165 --> 18:26.611
Really?

18:26.613 --> 18:27.538
Yeah.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.266
I'm in a good mood today.

18:29.268 --> 18:31.794
You got a nice trim there...
kind of brings out the ears.

18:31.796 --> 18:32.275
You like it?

18:32.277 --> 18:33.394
Yeah.

18:33.396 --> 18:34.387
You got the bottles
every Saturday?

18:34.389 --> 18:35.794
No, no, I work on Saturdays...

18:35.796 --> 18:36.754
Uh-huh.

18:36.756 --> 18:37.875
...the big shoplifting day.

18:37.877 --> 18:38.962
Yeah?

18:38.964 --> 18:40.626
I catch dozens
of bums like you.

18:40.628 --> 18:41.875
Good for you, man.

18:41.877 --> 18:45.778
If everybody was
that dedicated, shit.

18:45.780 --> 18:47.794
How'd you know?

18:47.796 --> 18:49.426
I know you.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.667
inside and out.

18:51.669 --> 18:52.531
You looking for trouble?

18:52.533 --> 18:54.003
No, no, no.

18:54.005 --> 18:57.459
Just a pair of jeans,
some undies, panties.

18:57.461 --> 19:00.115
You're beautiful.

19:00.117 --> 19:02.931
I almost want to touch you.

19:02.933 --> 19:08.212
Oh, you touch me, I'll
touch you, and you know it.

19:15.317 --> 19:17.362
Down there on the right.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.786
I'll frisk you later.

19:22.101 --> 19:25.107
Let the customer through.

19:25.109 --> 19:26.995
Where are you from?

19:26.997 --> 19:27.605
France.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.212
So your French.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.138
What?

19:37.140 --> 19:37.557
Oh.

19:53.717 --> 19:55.027
Hey!

19:55.029 --> 19:55.987
Hey!

19:55.989 --> 19:57.266
Hey, you bastard!

19:57.268 --> 19:59.348
Come back here,
you sleazy bastard!

20:02.549 --> 20:03.540
People will steal anything.

20:08.948 --> 20:10.258
Nice here, huh?

20:10.260 --> 20:13.042
Sitting out under the trees.

20:13.044 --> 20:14.514
We're good together, huh?

20:14.516 --> 20:14.995
Mm.

20:14.997 --> 20:15.955
Mm.

20:15.957 --> 20:17.586
The simple pleasures, man.

20:17.588 --> 20:19.731
No one bugging us.

20:19.733 --> 20:22.546
I'm going to use the loo,
try my new panties on, man.

20:22.548 --> 20:23.604
I hope they don't scratch.

20:32.181 --> 20:33.682
Walk slow, man.

20:33.684 --> 20:35.379
Walk slow.

20:35.381 --> 20:36.532
We're out for a stroll.

20:40.692 --> 20:42.386
You hungry?

20:42.388 --> 20:44.691
No.

20:44.693 --> 20:45.651
It's nice.

20:45.653 --> 20:50.034
It's nice to be.

20:50.036 --> 20:53.842
Just like flies always
buzzing around our balls.

20:53.844 --> 20:54.994
Not so fast, Jesus.

20:54.996 --> 20:57.267
It's like they
can't live without us.

20:57.269 --> 20:58.387
What about Marie?

20:58.389 --> 21:01.171
We're just two
simple fuckheads!

21:01.173 --> 21:02.995
Yeah, but how's
she going to find us?

21:02.997 --> 21:04.626
She'll find us!

21:04.628 --> 21:06.003
And if she don't, she ain't
never been in the slammer,

21:06.005 --> 21:07.346
so fuck it!

21:26.676 --> 21:27.922
Miss!

21:27.924 --> 21:28.851
Miss!

21:28.853 --> 21:30.483
You didn't pay your check!

21:30.485 --> 21:31.410
Miss!

21:31.412 --> 21:33.363
Get back here!

21:33.365 --> 21:34.354
Fucking Mexicans!

21:34.356 --> 21:36.114
Fuck you, you fucking hicks!

21:36.116 --> 21:36.754
I'll get you!

21:38.228 --> 21:39.442
What the fuck are those
things they're carrying?

21:39.444 --> 21:40.371
My balls!

21:40.373 --> 21:42.291
Fuck your balls, man!

21:42.293 --> 21:43.251
Stand up!

21:43.253 --> 21:45.171
The winner!

21:45.173 --> 21:46.674
Woo!

21:46.676 --> 21:49.554
Jesus Quintana!

21:57.588 --> 21:58.805
You fucking asshole!

22:10.932 --> 22:12.819
What the fuck you
doing in there, man?

22:12.821 --> 22:13.875
It was open.

22:13.877 --> 22:15.219
Shit, nobody told me.

22:15.221 --> 22:15.891
Come on.

22:15.893 --> 22:17.426
Get in.

22:17.428 --> 22:18.642
Fucking rock and roll, man.

22:18.644 --> 22:19.443
Let's rock and roll!

22:19.445 --> 22:19.860
Hey!

22:20.853 --> 22:21.811
Hurry up, man!

22:21.813 --> 22:23.346
That's my car!

22:23.348 --> 22:24.306
Get out of my car!

22:26.228 --> 22:27.571
Fuck you, baby!

22:27.573 --> 22:29.458
Stop!

22:29.460 --> 22:31.378
Hey!

22:52.085 --> 22:52.852
Put on the gas!

23:00.149 --> 23:05.426
I want to see his name, Paul
Dominique, in the obits column.

23:05.428 --> 23:06.931
Fuck.

23:06.933 --> 23:09.490
You shouldn't do that.

23:09.492 --> 23:10.579
What?

23:10.581 --> 23:13.170
Never wish
another person dead.

23:13.172 --> 23:14.290
What are you talking about?

23:14.292 --> 23:15.381
Nothing I ever wish
for comes true.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.171
Where are we going?

24:06.068 --> 24:08.946
What do you want?

24:08.948 --> 24:11.763
Nothing.

24:17.364 --> 24:21.811
Yeah, man, it's like he had
a beer or something, right?

24:21.813 --> 24:23.283
Got to be honest, man,
there's nothing more

24:23.285 --> 24:26.707
dope than a fine black woman.

24:26.709 --> 24:28.627
Blondes have more fun?

24:28.629 --> 24:29.237
Bullshit.

24:33.269 --> 24:39.922
I lost my virginity to a
in the synagogue.

24:39.924 --> 24:42.483
It was my Uncle Pedro's house.

25:08.853 --> 25:10.419
You bastard!

25:10.421 --> 25:11.539
You ditched me!

25:11.541 --> 25:13.170
Marie, I told him not too.

25:13.172 --> 25:14.578
Fucking pussies.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.139
I come out of the toilet,
and you fucking disappear?

25:17.141 --> 25:20.371
Left me cold like
some..

25:20.373 --> 25:22.323
Hey, it was a one bobo move.

25:22.325 --> 25:23.890
Admit it, man.

25:23.892 --> 25:25.779
First, you stick my
ass with the check.

25:25.781 --> 25:27.187
I dropped everything.

25:27.189 --> 25:30.610
I lost my job, and you run
away like a chicken shit.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.602
Gutless bitch.

25:31.604 --> 25:32.370
Hey, I'm not a bitch.

25:32.372 --> 25:33.459
Chill out, woman.

25:33.461 --> 25:34.867
We couldn't afford
to get pinched.

25:34.869 --> 25:36.691
You ain't never
been in the joint.

25:36.693 --> 25:39.922
Suppose something
had happened to me, eh?

25:39.924 --> 25:42.130
Fuckheads.

25:49.044 --> 25:54.067
When you think about it,
it's a drag to be famous, eh?

25:54.069 --> 25:58.323
I'll tell you who was
underrated, Vanessa Del Rio.

25:58.325 --> 26:00.082
I don't like porn.

26:00.084 --> 26:01.074
She got so into it.

26:01.076 --> 26:03.186
She's like Pacino or something.

26:03.188 --> 26:06.130
Oh, there are good
actresses and bad actresses,

26:06.132 --> 26:06.996
even in porn.

26:09.461 --> 26:12.690
What's off season mean to you?

26:12.692 --> 26:14.899
Vacation.

26:14.901 --> 26:18.579
When I was a kid, I
never went anywhere.

26:54.932 --> 26:56.371
Home sweet home, man.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.725
Yeah, shit, man.

27:08.916 --> 27:10.290
We're good together, no?

27:10.292 --> 27:10.709
Eh?

27:15.028 --> 27:15.444
Oh.

27:27.764 --> 27:29.074
Jesus.

27:29.076 --> 27:31.570
Huh?

27:31.572 --> 27:33.682
My jimmy is limp.

27:33.684 --> 27:34.611
So what?

27:34.613 --> 27:37.362
So is mine.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.900
I always wake
up with a hard on.

27:43.956 --> 27:45.298
Come on in, man.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.354
This feels great.

27:46.356 --> 27:47.283
I can't.

27:47.285 --> 27:49.939
I'll start bleeding again.

27:49.941 --> 27:53.011
Man, your feet ain't
gonna bleed, man.

27:53.013 --> 27:55.764
Oh, look at this, eh?

27:58.644 --> 28:00.435
, man.

28:00.437 --> 28:02.962
Woo!

28:02.964 --> 28:06.003
You prick!

28:06.005 --> 28:08.211
You stink, man.

28:08.213 --> 28:12.339
Get some crud off, purify
the air, you understand?

28:12.341 --> 28:15.538
Yeah, come on, man,
you'll be all right.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.554
It's all in your head, man.

28:17.556 --> 28:20.306
Stop worrying.

28:20.308 --> 28:23.346
You feel good, eh?

28:23.348 --> 28:26.578
You feel any better?

28:26.580 --> 28:28.659
Maybe too?

28:28.661 --> 28:29.301
Come on, man.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.036
Woo!

28:55.253 --> 28:56.434
You are really pretty, man.

28:56.436 --> 28:57.394
Back off.

28:57.396 --> 28:59.794
Don't be ashamed, man.

28:59.796 --> 29:01.650
I'm not ashamed.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.123
I just don't want to.

29:03.125 --> 29:05.554
How do you know if you ain't
never even tried it, man?

29:05.556 --> 29:06.739
Let me have a go at it, man.

29:06.741 --> 29:07.378
Come on.

29:07.380 --> 29:08.818
Hey!

29:08.820 --> 29:10.771
And by the way, did Paul
Dominique get his job back?

29:12.212 --> 29:13.522
Holy shit!

29:13.524 --> 29:15.090
I'm not doing it!

29:15.092 --> 29:16.882
Come on, man.

29:16.884 --> 29:17.523
It's all right.

29:17.525 --> 29:18.387
It's not happening!

29:18.389 --> 29:20.115
It's not happening!

29:20.117 --> 29:21.106
Come on.

29:21.108 --> 29:23.314
It... it's OK between friends.

29:23.316 --> 29:25.171
No means no!

29:25.173 --> 29:26.098
Hey, man, take it easy.

29:26.100 --> 29:30.450
Hey, man, take it easy, man.

29:30.452 --> 29:31.410
Ahh, fuck.

29:31.412 --> 29:32.242
I would have let you.

29:32.244 --> 29:33.298
I'm bleeding.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.194
Petey?

29:34.196 --> 29:35.346
What happened?

29:35.348 --> 29:36.499
Lovers quarrel?

29:36.501 --> 29:38.132
I tried to do the right thing.

29:41.108 --> 29:41.940
Hey, Petey.

29:45.972 --> 29:48.307
You know what?

29:48.309 --> 29:49.109
Do you know what I think?

29:51.764 --> 29:54.771
If men knew more
about getting fucked,

29:54.773 --> 29:56.724
maybe they would be
better at fucking.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.395
What?

30:01.397 --> 30:02.259
You want to fuck me?

30:02.261 --> 30:03.090
Go ahead.

30:03.092 --> 30:04.435
Be my guest.

30:04.437 --> 30:08.242
Hey, we didn't come
here for your ass, OK?

30:08.244 --> 30:09.331
Yeah?

30:09.333 --> 30:10.164
So what do you want then?

30:14.037 --> 30:15.442
I want news.

30:15.444 --> 30:16.947
I want news of your
pimp hairdresser.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.386
Paul is not my pimp.

30:18.388 --> 30:20.306
He get his car back?

30:20.308 --> 30:22.899
You talk to your friend, the...
the... the... the manicurist?

30:22.901 --> 30:24.178
Dominique, yeah.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.683
So... so how's he doing, eh?

30:25.685 --> 30:26.515
Eh?

30:26.517 --> 30:27.475
Paul Dominique, eh?

30:27.477 --> 30:28.594
Is he happy?

30:28.596 --> 30:29.554
About what?

30:29.556 --> 30:31.890
About getting his car back.

30:31.892 --> 30:33.075
He sold it.

30:33.077 --> 30:35.986
He so... he sold it?

30:35.988 --> 30:38.098
Mhm.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.690
To... to who?

30:40.692 --> 30:44.595
To some car
salesman, some guy.

30:44.597 --> 30:45.461
I don't know.

30:57.716 --> 31:00.723
Some of those people
driving around that deathtrap.

31:00.725 --> 31:04.978
OK, what do we do now?

31:09.236 --> 31:09.747
Jesus.

31:09.749 --> 31:11.186
I got it up.

31:11.188 --> 31:11.827
Yeah, I know, man.

31:11.829 --> 31:12.754
What a monster.

31:12.756 --> 31:13.618
Good for you.

31:13.620 --> 31:14.290
Oh.

31:14.292 --> 31:15.219
Oh.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.050
Take it easy, man.

31:16.052 --> 31:18.291
I'm getting seasick.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.042
Don't get so excited.

31:21.044 --> 31:23.059
Take your time, man, negotiate.

31:24.852 --> 31:26.163
Oh.

31:31.412 --> 31:33.394
Nice going, man.

31:33.396 --> 31:34.899
Great performance.

31:34.901 --> 31:36.243
Three and a half minutes, man.

31:36.245 --> 31:37.330
Jesus, want to try?

31:37.332 --> 31:38.962
You got there
so fast she never

31:38.964 --> 31:40.242
left the starting gate, man?

31:40.244 --> 31:41.170
Mhm.

31:41.172 --> 31:42.034
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:42.036 --> 31:42.994
Come on.

31:42.996 --> 31:45.171
Watch and learn, young man.

31:45.173 --> 31:45.874
You have to admire...

31:45.876 --> 31:46.834
Sorry.

31:46.836 --> 31:48.786
...the professionalism, man.

31:48.788 --> 31:50.770
The flexibility, man.

31:50.772 --> 31:53.394
It's all about finessing.

31:53.396 --> 31:56.370
Nice and easy,
man, does it, man.

31:56.372 --> 31:59.763
We have the whole night
ahead of us, right, Marie?

32:00.789 --> 32:01.426
Oh!

32:01.428 --> 32:02.226
Yeah!

32:02.228 --> 32:03.250
Woo!

32:03.252 --> 32:03.699
Woo!

32:03.701 --> 32:04.946
Yeah!

32:04.948 --> 32:05.395
Ah!

32:05.397 --> 32:06.579
Woo!

32:06.581 --> 32:07.378
Yeah.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.075
Am I hurting you?

32:09.077 --> 32:09.810
No.

32:09.812 --> 32:10.291
Are you sure?

32:10.293 --> 32:10.930
Yeah.

32:10.932 --> 32:12.211
Yeah.

32:12.213 --> 32:14.259
Well, usually, I hear
like a sort of whimper

32:14.261 --> 32:15.538
in the back of the throat.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.426
No, I'm fine.

32:17.428 --> 32:20.434
You realize you're in
the hands of a stud, eh?

32:20.436 --> 32:21.907
, eh?

32:21.909 --> 32:24.339
Yeah.

32:24.341 --> 32:25.747
You OK?

32:25.749 --> 32:26.386
Yeah.

32:26.388 --> 32:27.058
I'm fine.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.170
You sure?

32:29.172 --> 32:31.858
Are you always like this, Marie?

32:31.860 --> 32:34.419
Like what?

32:34.421 --> 32:35.602
I don't know.

32:35.604 --> 32:37.522
She ain't into your bullshit.

32:37.524 --> 32:38.067
She likes me better.

32:38.069 --> 32:40.882
Right, Marie?

32:40.884 --> 32:44.787
Ain't no pleasure for the
Jesus not to give pleasure.

32:44.789 --> 32:45.778
College shit, man.

32:45.780 --> 32:48.210
I'm into serious bowling, eh?

32:48.212 --> 32:52.882
I'm sorry, Marie, but
don't you ever get off?

32:52.884 --> 32:56.722
Oh, I don't know.

32:56.724 --> 32:57.778
I don't mind.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.642
What do you mean?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.107
You never came, never?

33:01.109 --> 33:02.578
No.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.915
That's deep.

33:04.917 --> 33:08.626
Well, maybe I
wasn't made right.

33:08.628 --> 33:10.482
How are the other girls?

33:10.484 --> 33:11.571
What do they do?

33:11.573 --> 33:13.042
They're alive.

33:13.044 --> 33:15.090
You know, they... they...
they enjoy themselves.

33:15.092 --> 33:17.170
They moan, and they
thank you with their eyes.

33:17.172 --> 33:19.443
Their eyes... their eyes
roll back in their heads.

33:19.445 --> 33:20.309
You could see the whites.

33:24.084 --> 33:26.741
Maybe you could teach me.

33:31.541 --> 33:32.019
Want to try?

33:32.021 --> 33:32.789
Yeah, man.

33:35.477 --> 33:38.002
Be my guest, man.

33:38.004 --> 33:39.540
I got... I got to recover
a little bit, eh?

33:44.181 --> 33:47.283
Don't feel like you
have to say anything.

33:47.285 --> 33:50.131
Silence doesn't bother me.

33:50.133 --> 33:51.826
I'm a loner.

33:51.828 --> 33:53.842
And I plan to stay that way.

33:53.844 --> 33:56.787
No kids, no man.

33:56.789 --> 33:58.642
I don't cheat on anyone.

33:58.644 --> 34:00.466
I sleep with everybody.

34:00.468 --> 34:02.643
That way, no one is jealous.

34:02.645 --> 34:04.339
But not in my place.

34:04.341 --> 34:06.355
I fuck on the outside.

34:06.357 --> 34:12.178
And I remember, not like the
bitches who pretend not to.

34:12.179 --> 34:19.539
You remember all those faces,
drooling, groping, filthy words

34:19.541 --> 34:21.777
they whisper in your ear.

34:21.780 --> 34:24.531
Why always the left ear?

34:24.533 --> 34:26.739
Strange.

34:26.741 --> 34:31.186
oops, all
those kind of things.

34:31.188 --> 34:35.540
374 guys I had, you
know, inside me.

34:39.764 --> 34:41.650
Oh, don't give me that look.

34:41.652 --> 34:45.393
It don't even add
up to one a week.

34:45.396 --> 34:47.635
Did you count us in the total?

34:47.637 --> 34:49.074
Of course not.

34:49.076 --> 34:50.194
Wow!

34:50.196 --> 34:52.242
So you didn't
remember we balled.

34:52.244 --> 34:54.963
Well, I don't
call that balling.

34:54.965 --> 34:57.235
What do you call it?

34:57.237 --> 35:00.594
Well, making love a little.

35:00.596 --> 35:02.259
And we succeeded?

35:02.261 --> 35:04.179
Well, I'm sorry, no.

35:04.181 --> 35:07.282
But you tried, A for effort.

35:08.021 --> 35:09.522
Oh, shit.

35:26.229 --> 35:30.354
OK, guys, when I whistle,
the coast is clear.

35:39.540 --> 35:44.754
We're busted, flat broke,
and she comes up with this.

35:44.756 --> 35:45.394
Unbelievable.

35:47.189 --> 35:48.819
She's a genius.

35:48.821 --> 35:49.842
Masterpiece.

35:58.421 --> 36:03.058
Do you remember the fun we
had, eh, at the sex parties?

36:03.060 --> 36:06.802
Come on, boy.

36:06.804 --> 36:07.762
Come on, boy.
Get it.

36:07.764 --> 36:08.211
Get it.

36:08.213 --> 36:09.171
Get it.

36:25.589 --> 36:28.627
That motherfucker.

36:28.629 --> 36:30.228
Look out for
the shit, bitch.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.658
Hey, kiss me.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.739
Where is the register, eh?

36:38.741 --> 36:39.666
Eh?

36:39.668 --> 36:42.322
Hey, kiss me.

36:42.324 --> 36:43.474
You hear me?

36:43.476 --> 36:43.954
I want you to kiss me.

36:43.956 --> 36:44.562
Not now.

36:45.684 --> 36:48.658
You promised
you'd kiss me.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.707
And right now.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.179
I want to know what
the fuck I'm missing.

36:52.181 --> 36:54.802
Where's the alarm, man?

36:54.804 --> 36:56.467
Hey, I'm in the mood now.

36:57.620 --> 37:00.082
Hey, this is the perfect place.

37:00.084 --> 37:01.107
Is that... is that an alarm?

37:01.109 --> 37:02.931
So fucking kiss me.

37:02.933 --> 37:04.179
It could be a booby trap.

37:04.181 --> 37:05.619
Is the alarm still on?

37:05.621 --> 37:06.963
But how long is it
going to take us, eh?

37:06.965 --> 37:07.827
It's going to take...

37:07.829 --> 37:09.202
Is that an alarm?

37:09.204 --> 37:11.154
I'm going to give
you a fucking alarm?

37:11.156 --> 37:12.819
I'm not just a sex machine.

37:14.004 --> 37:18.099
I'm fed up with a guy who
thinks my ass is a bowling lane.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.187
I want to feel something here.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.586
You promised you'd
kiss me, fuckheads.

37:26.997 --> 37:27.666
Oh!

37:28.532 --> 37:31.378
What the fuck, eh?

37:31.380 --> 37:32.338
I didn't do anything.

37:32.340 --> 37:33.330
You'd be better off.

37:33.332 --> 37:34.515
Paul is going to find me.

37:34.517 --> 37:35.442
We still love you.

37:35.444 --> 37:36.499
I could go to jail.

37:36.501 --> 37:37.587
I'm an accomplice.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.571
Tell him
we kidnapped you.

37:39.573 --> 37:40.882
I won't be a problem.

37:41.429 --> 37:43.794
Jesus! Petey!

37:43.796 --> 37:45.139
We got to pull a Houdini.

37:45.141 --> 37:46.642
Hit the mattresses.

38:31.092 --> 38:32.818
Woo!

38:32.820 --> 38:34.580
Woo! Done.

39:26.548 --> 39:27.219
Woo!

39:27.221 --> 39:27.828
Woo!

39:36.148 --> 39:36.564
Woo!

39:42.932 --> 39:44.179
Mmm, that's right.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.874
I'm going to hold you
like a bowling ball.

39:47.157 --> 39:48.754
You couldn't even take
off your tag, asshole.

39:48.756 --> 39:49.683
Hey!

39:51.125 --> 39:52.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:52.628 --> 39:53.490
I'm not that easy.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.388
Fucking.

39:54.741 --> 39:56.338
He thought
he could get over.

39:57.557 --> 40:00.178
You.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.587
It was a power move, man.

40:01.589 --> 40:02.451
Old school.

40:02.453 --> 40:03.379
We could have scored.

40:03.381 --> 40:04.306
I could have scored.

40:04.308 --> 40:06.418
No more shampoo girls, man.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.338
I liked Marie because
she was good people.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.674
You know what
you need, my friend?

40:10.676 --> 40:14.194
A night with a real
woman, a tiger.

40:14.196 --> 40:15.187
OK, I'm all for that.

40:15.189 --> 40:17.074
A fighter.

40:17.076 --> 40:19.443
You don't know which
is end is up, man.

40:19.445 --> 40:20.370
You think it's over.

40:20.372 --> 40:23.122
And she swoops in on that.

40:23.124 --> 40:24.435
Woo!

40:24.437 --> 40:25.299
Hold my ball, bro.

40:25.301 --> 40:26.547
Hey, where we going?

40:26.549 --> 40:29.842
My reservoir, private
grounds, 300 women.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.906
You barely touch them, and
they are slow dying for it.

40:33.908 --> 40:36.243
Get the picture?

40:36.245 --> 40:37.042
300 women?

40:56.309 --> 40:58.131
A loser.

40:58.133 --> 41:02.580
I think she's beautiful,
unbelievably beautiful.

41:23.668 --> 41:24.084
Go get the car.

41:26.772 --> 41:27.380
Vamos.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.682
Don't be afraid.

41:33.684 --> 41:35.475
Listen, you can't
stay here all alone.

41:35.477 --> 41:38.259
Where are you going?

41:38.261 --> 41:39.411
I don't know.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.362
You got any money?

41:41.364 --> 41:43.059
Someone to call?

41:43.061 --> 41:44.242
No.

41:44.244 --> 41:46.899
You got any
clothes in that bag?

41:46.901 --> 41:48.178
No.

41:48.180 --> 41:52.083
And you got no cash, no
clothes, nowhere to go.

41:52.085 --> 41:53.842
What do you have to offer?

41:53.844 --> 41:54.931
Everything.

41:54.933 --> 41:56.787
We're at your service?

41:56.789 --> 42:00.595
Jesus Quintana with
a car and cash.

42:00.597 --> 42:02.034
Trouble?

42:02.036 --> 42:03.475
Everything all right?

42:03.477 --> 42:06.322
Yeah, man, we just got
a little engine trouble.

42:06.324 --> 42:07.762
You can put your car.

42:07.764 --> 42:08.979
Where is it?

42:08.981 --> 42:11.826
You know, it's at...
at the garage, yeah.

42:11.828 --> 42:12.915
Thank you very much.

42:12.917 --> 42:14.643
Yeah, but... but
the lady, what's...

42:14.645 --> 42:18.418
Hit the road, sucker,
before I put it in your ass.

42:22.517 --> 42:27.442
Shit, when you need them,
the bastards never stop, eh?

42:29.940 --> 42:31.507
Here, take it.

42:31.509 --> 42:32.117
Take it.

42:34.836 --> 42:36.307
Go ahead.

42:36.309 --> 42:38.835
And come with us.

42:38.837 --> 42:40.626
Is that heavy?

42:40.628 --> 42:42.675
Shit yeah.

42:49.749 --> 42:50.578
What the fuck?

42:50.580 --> 42:51.986
Hey, watch it, man.

42:51.988 --> 42:53.554
Well, she is just
carrying a piece, man.

42:53.556 --> 42:54.355
No, asshole.

42:54.357 --> 42:55.539
That's our piece.

42:55.541 --> 42:58.738
I gave it to her so
she can trust us.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.626
But now... now she does, right?

43:00.628 --> 43:01.554
I'm OK.

43:01.556 --> 43:02.931
Are you out of your mind?

43:02.933 --> 43:04.626
I got involved in a totally
fucked up scene here.

43:04.628 --> 43:05.554
Hey, now fuck you.
Be polite.

43:05.556 --> 43:06.610
There's a lady in the car.

43:06.612 --> 43:07.572
Everything is fucked up.

43:12.084 --> 43:12.756
What's your name, hmm?

43:16.244 --> 43:20.371
767.

43:20.373 --> 43:23.122
OK, 767, what you
feel like doing, eh?

43:23.124 --> 43:23.732
Nothing.

43:26.901 --> 43:28.147
We can't keep driving
around like this.

43:28.149 --> 43:29.842
That's not my problem.

43:29.844 --> 43:31.027
I didn't ask you for anything.

43:31.029 --> 43:32.405
Don't ask me to make
decisions for you.

43:35.316 --> 43:35.733
Comfy?

43:38.421 --> 43:40.882
My feet hurt.

43:40.884 --> 43:42.226
OK.

43:42.228 --> 43:43.476
We'll get you some new
kicks and some fresh gear.

43:55.797 --> 43:56.405
Here.

44:00.245 --> 44:02.515
Thanks.

44:02.517 --> 44:03.538
I'll go in alone.

44:03.540 --> 44:04.402
You won't
need to go, man.

44:04.404 --> 44:05.266
The alarm might go off.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.005
I'm keeping the gun.

44:11.988 --> 44:13.779
I don't like this broad.

44:13.781 --> 44:14.674
She's giving me the creeps.

44:14.676 --> 44:15.762
I don't trust her.

44:15.764 --> 44:18.034
Hey, no one's
keeping you, man.

44:18.036 --> 44:20.530
How much you want, hm?

44:20.532 --> 44:23.763
Come on, man.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.459
Off to an orgy.

44:33.461 --> 44:36.178
You think they get jealous?

44:36.180 --> 44:36.788
No.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.940
She's all yours.

44:54.804 --> 44:58.323
No, no, no, no, no, no.

44:58.325 --> 44:58.932
Thanks.

45:18.549 --> 45:19.157
Good.

45:24.692 --> 45:25.109
Slowly.

45:29.013 --> 45:29.715
Why?

45:29.717 --> 45:30.579
Slowly.

45:30.581 --> 45:30.996
You should eat slowly.

45:34.581 --> 45:35.827
Right.

45:35.829 --> 45:36.437
Thanks.

45:46.964 --> 45:50.163
Would you care for
anything else, ma'am?

45:50.165 --> 45:52.404
Oh, no, I'm good.

45:55.316 --> 46:00.531
Kind of slow this time
of year, I guess, eh?

46:00.533 --> 46:01.170
Yes.

46:01.172 --> 46:02.578
Yes.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.010
But we always have people
passing through, you know,

46:05.012 --> 46:06.066
the restaurant's reputation.

46:06.068 --> 46:07.090
Oh.

46:07.092 --> 46:08.242
What?

46:08.244 --> 46:09.682
You're like in a
guidebook or something?

46:09.684 --> 46:10.962
No, no, actually we
prefer not to do that.

46:10.964 --> 46:11.602
Really?

46:11.604 --> 46:12.594
No.

46:12.596 --> 46:13.810
Why?

46:13.812 --> 46:15.058
Well, the crowds
there, they're dreadful.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.722
There are just... things
can get out of hand.

46:16.724 --> 46:20.530
And then where would we
be with just three stars?

46:20.532 --> 46:21.298
I have no idea.

46:21.300 --> 46:24.501
I can't.

46:25.557 --> 46:27.571
You can't keep your
eye on everyone.

46:27.573 --> 46:28.978
No.

46:28.980 --> 46:30.453
You couldn't keep
your eye on everyone.

46:41.460 --> 46:45.172
How about, um, after
dinner drinks on the house?

46:47.829 --> 46:48.437
Enjoy.

46:52.244 --> 46:54.036
She thought we were going
to leave without paying.

47:03.572 --> 47:05.938
Thank you.

47:05.940 --> 47:06.548
For what?

47:09.653 --> 47:10.482
For everything.

47:10.484 --> 47:11.348
For the... the meal.

47:15.924 --> 47:23.189
I, um, I can only
thank you in the bed.

47:28.917 --> 47:31.378
You can turn the
lights out if you want.

47:31.380 --> 47:32.722
I'm not saying that you
have to turn them out.

47:32.724 --> 47:35.122
But if you want to, it
doesn't really matter.

47:35.124 --> 47:36.116
It's been such a long time.

47:40.308 --> 47:44.307
I don't know if I remember how.

47:44.309 --> 47:46.101
You might have to each me.

47:49.044 --> 47:51.570
I mean, you know how they
do it nowadays, you know?

47:51.572 --> 47:53.043
Everything.

47:53.045 --> 47:55.410
We can do everything.

47:55.412 --> 47:56.276
All right?

48:01.172 --> 48:04.339
Madame, that was excellent.

48:04.341 --> 48:06.066
Thank you so much.

48:06.068 --> 48:07.059
Oh, it's my pleasure.

48:07.061 --> 48:08.211
Really, that was such a treat.

48:08.213 --> 48:09.363
I just got out of prison.

48:09.365 --> 48:11.379
So it was very special for me.

48:11.381 --> 48:12.786
And, you know, it's been years.

48:12.788 --> 48:16.690
I've been in a wet,
dark cell, no sky.

48:16.692 --> 48:18.771
And I... that's why
my period stopped,

48:18.773 --> 48:20.434
I think, because
of the darkness.

48:20.436 --> 48:23.250
You know, first it was a week
late, then two weeks late.

48:23.252 --> 48:25.555
Pretty soon, you
just forget about it.

48:25.557 --> 48:27.123
I... I...

48:27.125 --> 48:28.146
it's not my fault.

48:28.148 --> 48:30.034
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:30.036 --> 48:35.026
I just... I want you to
appreciate the bleeding.

48:35.028 --> 48:37.810
I know that makes you
cranky, and, you know,

48:37.812 --> 48:39.058
you feel bloated, the
pain and everything.

48:39.060 --> 48:40.147
But that's not what matters.

48:40.149 --> 48:42.292
What matters is the bleeding.

48:45.524 --> 48:47.859
Why are you telling me this?

48:47.861 --> 48:49.362
So you'll be aware.

48:49.364 --> 48:51.603
And you tell your friends.

48:51.605 --> 48:53.395
Because we don't talk
about these things enough.

48:53.397 --> 48:54.355
No, we don't.

48:54.357 --> 48:56.818
We don't talk about it.

48:56.820 --> 48:57.874
Do you have a mint?

48:57.876 --> 48:59.794
Yes, like, right... yeah.

48:59.796 --> 49:01.683
Here you go.

49:01.685 --> 49:02.100
You're welcome.

49:04.917 --> 49:08.818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

50:53.364 --> 50:58.738
My name is Jean.
What's yours?

50:58.740 --> 50:59.157
Peter.

51:01.941 --> 51:05.074
Well, there's not going to be
much left of you when I'm done,

51:05.076 --> 51:06.546
Peter.

51:06.548 --> 51:16.148
It's now time off with 767.

53:42.293 --> 53:43.061
I have my period.

53:55.989 --> 53:58.482
Everything OK?

53:58.484 --> 54:01.362
No.

54:01.364 --> 54:02.228
No, really.

54:27.221 --> 54:30.099
It's over.

54:30.101 --> 54:31.925
It will be all right, hmm.

54:48.308 --> 54:53.106
Jean Bersome, 767.

54:53.108 --> 54:56.338
She couldn't
hack being free.

54:56.340 --> 54:57.459
Shit.

54:57.461 --> 55:00.147
What?

55:00.149 --> 55:03.859
She's got a kid,
man, in prison.

55:03.861 --> 55:06.483
Boy or a girl?

55:06.485 --> 55:07.602
It's signed Jack.

55:07.604 --> 55:10.738
They're all... they're
all Jack, man.

55:10.740 --> 55:12.084
How... how old is he?

55:14.613 --> 55:15.252
Just a kid.

55:38.613 --> 55:41.842
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

55:41.844 --> 55:43.474
That's him.

55:43.476 --> 55:45.106
Jack Bersome?

55:45.108 --> 55:47.347
That's me.

55:47.349 --> 55:48.819
Your mother sent us.

55:48.821 --> 55:50.227
767.

55:50.229 --> 55:52.147
Well, why didn't
she come herself

55:52.149 --> 55:53.875
if she got out two months ago?

55:53.877 --> 55:56.530
Yeah, but she... you
know, she went abroad.

55:56.532 --> 55:57.874
Where?

55:57.876 --> 55:59.539
Portugal.

55:59.541 --> 56:01.491
Where's Portugal?

56:01.493 --> 56:03.250
I mean, I haven't heard
from her in two months.

56:03.252 --> 56:04.435
She couldn't write?

56:04.437 --> 56:06.195
What the fuck is she
doing in Portugal?

56:06.197 --> 56:10.706
She split with a good
friend of ours, terrific guy.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.522
He's an engineer.

56:13.524 --> 56:14.835
Agricultural.

56:14.837 --> 56:16.179
She said go and get
Jack and take care of him.

56:16.181 --> 56:17.811
And she's very happy.

56:17.813 --> 56:19.666
She'll be back soon.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.715
Who's this agricultural guy?

56:21.717 --> 56:22.771
Don't worry about it.

56:22.773 --> 56:24.114
He's a good guy.

56:24.116 --> 56:26.386
If he's so good,
why isn't he here?

56:26.388 --> 56:27.346
He's got a record.

56:27.348 --> 56:28.435
How many busts?

56:28.437 --> 56:30.802
One served,
two suspended.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.427
Not bad.

56:33.429 --> 56:36.019
Is that your car, Plymouth Fury?

56:36.021 --> 56:37.810
Third generation.

56:37.812 --> 56:39.476
The Swedish police
used to use that.

56:42.005 --> 56:42.677
And they never die.

56:45.717 --> 56:46.548
Check it out, man.

56:49.268 --> 56:50.580
This shit's vintage, man.

57:35.381 --> 57:37.618
This is Marie.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.699
She's our girl.

57:39.701 --> 57:41.970
And now I'm yours too.

57:41.972 --> 57:45.874
The only hitch is I can't come.

57:45.876 --> 57:48.307
Coffee?

57:48.309 --> 57:49.716
Sure, just a drop.

57:54.996 --> 57:56.403
You're not hungry?

57:56.405 --> 57:57.651
Yes.

57:57.653 --> 57:59.379
Want some jam?

57:59.381 --> 57:59.796
I don't know.

58:14.004 --> 58:16.690
We share everything.

58:16.692 --> 58:18.994
Hmm?

58:18.996 --> 58:20.914
Go ahead.

58:20.916 --> 58:22.546
We want you to.

58:22.548 --> 58:24.210
It's our pleasure, man.

58:24.212 --> 58:26.482
Your mom was...

58:26.484 --> 58:29.170
she's something special.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.005
Jack.

58:41.492 --> 58:41.909
She's really great.

58:44.372 --> 58:45.204
Come in.

59:24.756 --> 59:29.650
Thanks to us, a good
deal is cooking, hmm?

59:29.652 --> 59:30.802
Yeah.

59:30.804 --> 59:33.586
We're not always
doing the wrong thing.

59:33.588 --> 59:34.834
I'm proud of us.

59:34.836 --> 59:36.435
Every
about that chick.

59:36.437 --> 59:39.090
And no one's ever courted her.

59:39.092 --> 59:40.179
I mean, really, wooed her.

59:40.181 --> 59:41.045
That's what she needs.

59:55.701 --> 59:57.747
She wasn't made right.

59:57.749 --> 59:59.698
She said it herself.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.074
It's like she's missing a...

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:02.355
a chromosome or something.

01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:04.306
Her little chest gets me.

01:00:04.308 --> 01:00:06.226
You can almost
see the heartbeat.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.411
She's like a little reindeer.

01:00:07.413 --> 01:00:09.106
Yeah, but it's a
point of honor, man,

01:00:09.108 --> 01:00:12.115
because we went through
the matter deep.

01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:14.610
Yeah, but it's not
always about the johnson

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:15.219
or the coochie, right?

01:00:15.221 --> 01:00:16.690
What do you mean?

01:00:16.692 --> 01:00:19.954
It's the brain telling
the body to let go, eh?

01:00:19.956 --> 01:00:22.419
It's perplexing shit.

01:00:25.172 --> 01:00:25.589
What was that?

01:00:30.357 --> 01:00:31.155
Shit, man.

01:00:31.157 --> 01:00:33.042
What is that?

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:34.387
What man?

01:01:00.564 --> 01:01:01.781
She's digging it.

01:01:04.596 --> 01:01:05.364
We're not involved at all.

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:09.522
Petey, Jesus, it happened!

01:01:09.524 --> 01:01:10.834
It happened!

01:01:10.836 --> 01:01:11.763
I came.

01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:14.034
I came!

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:17.202
Suddenly, everything turned
purple, my hair, my fingernails

01:01:17.204 --> 01:01:18.387
were on fire.

01:01:18.389 --> 01:01:22.706
I felt like I was
going to exploding.

01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:23.730
Go!

01:01:23.732 --> 01:01:24.211
Oh!

01:01:26.676 --> 01:01:28.915
That ought to cool you off.

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:30.771
But I did it.

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:33.555
I got my Christmas
present finally.

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.314
But I think of
how we knocked ourselves

01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:36.402
out over your hang up.

01:01:36.404 --> 01:01:37.747
Fully, night and day.

01:01:37.749 --> 01:01:39.058
I mean, what does
he got that we don't got?

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.667
What?

01:01:39.669 --> 01:01:41.299
One that vibrates?

01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.251
I mean, we put... we
put our hearts into it, man.

01:01:43.253 --> 01:01:47.155
This man's a harder
fucker, man, a samurai.

01:01:47.157 --> 01:01:47.826
Ahh!

01:01:47.828 --> 01:01:49.171
Yeah!

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:50.514
What did he do to you?

01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:51.603
Things.

01:01:51.605 --> 01:01:52.690
Well, what
kind of things?

01:01:52.692 --> 01:01:53.938
Nothing special.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.499
Anyway, I was the one
who did everything.

01:01:56.501 --> 01:01:57.363
You?

01:01:57.365 --> 01:01:59.122
You don't do anything.

01:01:59.124 --> 01:02:01.651
Well, yeah.

01:02:01.653 --> 01:02:03.219
He did not have the
balls to touch me.

01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:05.395
So I had to do all the work.

01:02:05.397 --> 01:02:09.042
And all of a sudden,
he busted a nut.

01:02:09.044 --> 01:02:10.387
And that's what made you come?

01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:11.826
No.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:15.058
I had him close, try
if you feel like it.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.546
So he did, making love to me.

01:02:18.548 --> 01:02:21.651
And he pops again.

01:02:21.653 --> 01:02:22.803
Two pump chump?

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:23.794
Lucky you.

01:02:23.796 --> 01:02:25.747
I asked him if he's a virgin.

01:02:25.749 --> 01:02:32.434
He says, yes and starts making
love to me again, slowly.

01:02:32.436 --> 01:02:33.778
Kissing me.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.995
Kiss me.

01:02:34.997 --> 01:02:36.754
Kissing me.

01:02:36.756 --> 01:02:37.779
Then this time.

01:02:37.781 --> 01:02:38.706
No, OK, we got it, OK?

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:39.442
No.

01:02:39.444 --> 01:02:40.179
But this time...

01:02:40.181 --> 01:02:41.650
Marie!

01:02:41.652 --> 01:02:42.739
Oh, I got to go.

01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:44.722
He needs me.

01:02:44.724 --> 01:02:46.258
Marie!

01:02:52.341 --> 01:02:52.948
Marie!

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:11.218
Oh, Jack, yes!

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.522
Woo!

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:14.739
It's too much.

01:03:14.741 --> 01:03:16.627
Yeah, they're from
another generation.

01:03:16.629 --> 01:03:17.364
No respect.

01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:56.466
Want some?

01:03:56.468 --> 01:03:59.763
Wouldn't want
to be any trouble.

01:03:59.765 --> 01:04:02.547
Maybe a little scrap
would be all right.

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:05.554
There's no dessert because
our cash just ran out.

01:04:05.556 --> 01:04:08.019
Oh, well, that's a bitch.

01:04:08.021 --> 01:04:10.291
We'll have to score.

01:04:10.293 --> 01:04:12.658
Can't go on like this.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.077
You got a gun?

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.539
Who said?

01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:25.074
It's $100,000.

01:04:25.076 --> 01:04:26.259
It's a cinch.

01:04:26.261 --> 01:04:28.594
No risk, you know,
just some old folks.

01:04:28.596 --> 01:04:30.418
We prefer to make
our own decisions

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.507
when it comes to risks.

01:04:31.509 --> 01:04:33.459
Yeah, well,
you interested?

01:04:33.461 --> 01:04:35.059
I mean, I could do it alone.

01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:36.178
I just... I do need a gun.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.460
It's a... it's a work tool.

01:04:43.733 --> 01:04:44.595
Well?

01:04:44.597 --> 01:04:45.298
I don't give a damn.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.717
You decide.

01:04:48.245 --> 01:04:49.555
Fine.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:52.563
Here you go.

01:04:52.565 --> 01:04:53.362
Good luck.

01:04:53.364 --> 01:04:55.282
Thank you.

01:04:55.284 --> 01:04:57.235
I told you they'd cop out.

01:04:57.237 --> 01:05:00.245
Hey, who said anything
about copping out?

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.490
Hey, man.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:30.418
Hey, what the fuck's going on?

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.762
You know this guy?

01:05:31.764 --> 01:05:32.372
Yeah.

01:05:35.316 --> 01:05:35.763
Hey.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:36.499
Hey.

01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:37.426
Look who it is.

01:05:37.428 --> 01:05:39.026
Son of a gun.

01:05:39.028 --> 01:05:39.954
Yeah.
Remember me?

01:05:39.956 --> 01:05:40.498
What a surprise.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.106
How you doing?

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.226
Yeah.

01:05:42.228 --> 01:05:43.090
What are you up to?

01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:44.786
Same game as before.

01:05:44.788 --> 01:05:45.298
Oh, yeah?

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:45.908
What's that?

01:06:03.477 --> 01:06:05.010
Jack?

01:06:05.012 --> 01:06:06.261
You fucking shot me.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.915
Where's Jack!

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:15.603
He's just standing
there like a statue.

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:16.530
Get in.

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:17.971
He's got the gun.

01:06:26.741 --> 01:06:29.170
Man, don't cry.

01:06:29.172 --> 01:06:31.378
I'm not crying.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.403
Emotions are for assholes.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.730
Hey, didn't you love him?

01:06:35.732 --> 01:06:36.562
I don't know.

01:06:36.564 --> 01:06:38.163
I didn't have time.

01:06:38.165 --> 01:06:40.882
He got the job done, OK?

01:06:40.884 --> 01:06:42.994
But you have to be a
dumbass to shoot a cop

01:06:42.996 --> 01:06:44.274
when we could have
gone like that.

01:06:44.276 --> 01:06:45.586
He wasn't a cop.

01:06:45.588 --> 01:06:47.794
He was a prison guard.

01:06:47.796 --> 01:06:49.172
The poor guy had nothing.

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:55.411
He never smiled.

01:06:55.413 --> 01:07:01.683
Yes, no, thanks, again,
stand up, sit down, lie down.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.997
Just like a fucking gym teacher.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.829
Maybe he didn't
notice he was free.

01:07:32.532 --> 01:07:34.546
You want me to
hold it for you?

01:07:36.629 --> 01:07:39.250
That's indecent exposure, man.

01:07:39.252 --> 01:07:40.404
I know about that shit.

01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:46.674
Yeah, man, life is a bitch.

01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:48.915
But, still, you have to
look on the bright side.

01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:50.514
We got our lady back, eh?

01:07:50.516 --> 01:07:51.762
You asleep?

01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:52.466
No.

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.322
Hey.

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:55.987
You know, why don't you get
up and take a look around?

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.939
There's a whole galaxy out here.

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:59.410
Mhm.

01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:00.308
The Big Dipper right
in front of our face.

01:08:07.413 --> 01:08:10.131
Oh, make love
to me, sweet Pete.

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:18.322
Oh!

01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:19.282
Hey!

01:08:19.956 --> 01:08:20.595
Hey!

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.459
Hey!

01:08:21.461 --> 01:08:21.939
Oh, that's so good.

01:08:24.084 --> 01:08:25.362
Oh, my god.

01:08:25.363 --> 01:08:26.322
Yeah!

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:40.978
Jesus, hurry up.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:41.813
I'm coming.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:47.635
Oh!

01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:48.595
Oh.

01:08:48.596 --> 01:08:49.555
Huh?

01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:28.850
You have to go.

01:09:28.853 --> 01:09:29.938
What's wrong?

01:09:29.939 --> 01:09:31.377
You can hitchhike
from here, man.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:31.890
What did I do?

01:09:31.893 --> 01:09:33.330
Nothing.

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:34.578
We are accomplices to
an attempted murder.

01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:35.345
It's in the papers.

01:09:35.348 --> 01:09:36.210
You're not.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:37.395
You didn't hurt anyone.

01:09:37.397 --> 01:09:38.643
But I'm... I'm in
deep with you guys.

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:39.921
No way, man.

01:09:39.924 --> 01:09:41.299
You have to go.

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:42.578
When I just started coming,
I'm feeling like this.

01:09:42.581 --> 01:09:43.219
No fucking way.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:43.858
Hey!

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:45.171
Hey!

01:09:45.173 --> 01:09:46.899
Don't be crazy, woman.

01:09:46.901 --> 01:09:49.714
I can't see you in a cell
with a number on your back.

01:09:49.716 --> 01:09:51.666
Stretch your wings
and fly, girl.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.362
Listen to my
feminine instinct.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:54.450
Sometimes I have vision.

01:09:54.452 --> 01:09:55.314
I'm never wrong.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:56.979
We're not going to jail.

01:09:56.981 --> 01:10:00.723
So shut up and make love to me.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.842
I don't know who
chose this car,

01:10:13.844 --> 01:10:15.859
but it's worse
than a prison cell.

01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:17.362
Ah, it's good for
the environment.

01:10:17.364 --> 01:10:18.675
Fuck the environment.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:19.666
Man, I can't breathe.

01:10:19.668 --> 01:10:20.595
I got to get out of here.

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:21.715
Oh, he can't breathe, man.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.379
What about the other people too.

01:10:23.381 --> 01:10:24.499
There's other people in the car.

01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:25.362
It's not just you.

01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:26.643
I know, but I...

01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:28.050
You know it's always
about him, right, Marie?

01:10:28.052 --> 01:10:28.914
I'm getting really
squished here.

01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:29.906
Yeah, always about him.

01:10:29.908 --> 01:10:31.858
Always about him, shit, man.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.756
It's unbelievable, man.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.332
I told you not.

01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:49.203
A family picnic and shit.

01:10:49.205 --> 01:10:50.163
Ah, no, no, no.

01:10:50.165 --> 01:10:52.083
What... what are you doing?

01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:54.003
I just have to pee.

01:10:54.005 --> 01:10:58.162
Oh, I've got to pee pee.

01:10:58.164 --> 01:10:58.866
Eww.

01:10:58.868 --> 01:10:59.604
Yeah, mira!

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.187
Holy shit.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:04.498
Oh, man.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.554
What's up, man?

01:11:05.556 --> 01:11:06.675
Hi.

01:11:06.677 --> 01:11:08.562
Another bank
robber special.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.611
What's happening?

01:11:10.613 --> 01:11:15.186
My Uncle Ronaldo had a 1968
red and white top convertible.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:17.619
Nice.

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:22.195
That's a great deal, our
smart car for a muscle car.

01:11:22.197 --> 01:11:23.986
Yes!

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.906
Yeah, that's it, man.

01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:27.730
She's
fucking cute, right?

01:11:27.732 --> 01:11:28.819
Starsky and Hutch!

01:11:28.821 --> 01:11:29.811
Dad, they're
taking the car.

01:11:29.813 --> 01:11:31.699
do something.

01:11:31.701 --> 01:11:33.266
Honey?

01:11:33.268 --> 01:11:35.122
My fucking car!

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.402
It's a fucking classic.

01:11:36.404 --> 01:11:38.674
Dad, do something!

01:11:38.676 --> 01:11:40.210
It's our car!

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:41.554
Hey, come back here!

01:11:41.556 --> 01:11:43.059
Dad!

01:11:54.356 --> 01:11:55.795
You guys did good.

01:11:55.797 --> 01:11:57.459
You should be proud, eh?

01:11:57.461 --> 01:12:02.002
You've got a real good solid
foundation now, Marie, OK?

01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:03.282
Where are we going?

01:12:03.284 --> 01:12:05.427
I don't know.

01:12:05.429 --> 01:12:08.979
What are they going to do to
us, put a hole in our ass?

01:12:08.981 --> 01:12:10.354
You already got one, man.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.850
Yeah.

01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:14.770
What do we do, just drive
around till we run out of gas?

01:12:14.772 --> 01:12:16.147
Why not?

01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:18.386
Why not?

01:12:18.388 --> 01:12:20.019
You're happy?

01:12:20.021 --> 01:12:21.266
Yeah.

01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:22.194
I am.

01:12:22.196 --> 01:12:22.738
We're good together, no?

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.348
Yeah.

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:30.357
Thanks, man, peaceful,
on the road, hanging loose.

01:13:13.428 --> 01:13:14.739
Oh!

01:13:14.741 --> 01:13:15.571
Go on, man.

01:13:15.573 --> 01:13:16.946
Come on, bitch. Shake it.

01:13:16.948 --> 01:13:19.954
Woo!

01:13:19.956 --> 01:13:21.235
Shake it, baby.

01:13:21.237 --> 01:13:22.133
All right, come on, shake it.

01:13:24.628 --> 01:13:25.044
Ho!

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.426
Ahhh!

01:13:37.781 --> 01:13:39.090
Ahh!

01:13:39.092 --> 01:13:40.020
What's that?

01:13:45.204 --> 01:13:46.066
Shit.

01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:48.019
The brakes are jammed.

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.299
Oh, filthy hairdresser.

01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:03.219
I thought this
car looked familiar.

01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:04.690
Why didn't
you say anything?

01:15:04.692 --> 01:15:06.067
Yeah, it was
orange, I remember.

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.314
Oh, my poor little balls.

01:15:07.316 --> 01:15:07.829
It was your idea.

01:16:28.059 --> 01:16:33.059
