00:01.667 --> 00:03.500
[instrumental music]

00:18.333 --> 00:21.417
You realize this is an extremely
dangerous situation.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.250
He's been through much worse.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.750
- I think he's doomed.
- Not a chance.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.708
Care to put money on that?

00:29.792 --> 00:31.958
Gambling is one
of the lesser sins.

00:32.042 --> 00:33.750
I've always thought
if you're going to sin

00:33.833 --> 00:36.208
you may as well go
for a really big ones--

00:36.292 --> 00:38.708
(Theo)
If you don't mind..

00:40.250 --> 00:42.500
I'm trying to concentrate.

00:42.583 --> 00:43.542
Sorry.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.292
Concentrate all you want.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.125
There's nowhere you can go.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.292
I'd expect a comment like that
from someone

00:50.375 --> 00:53.667
with no clearly defined
pattern of faith.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.625
I believe in a little
of everything.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.625
I'm...eclectic.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.167
Open-minded.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.125
Rudderless, directionless

01:01.208 --> 01:02.958
cast adrift without compass

01:03.042 --> 01:07.000
on an ocean
of ecclesiastical possibilities.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.042
Tossed by the winds
this way, that way.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.375
Oh, I'm hearing a lot
of talking.

01:10.458 --> 01:11.792
You still haven't made a move.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.417
Your Ambassador Delenn
has a wonderful phrase..

01:15.500 --> 01:17.125
Faith..

01:17.208 --> 01:19.583
...manages.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.125
Check.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.958
And I do believe..

01:24.208 --> 01:25.750
...mate.

01:28.750 --> 01:29.875
[beeping]

01:29.958 --> 01:31.125
Ivanova. Go.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.417
(female #1)
'Ambassador Kosh is about'

01:32.500 --> 01:33.667
'to come out of hyperspace.'

01:33.750 --> 01:35.458
'He'd like you to meet him
in Bay 13.'

01:35.542 --> 01:37.375
Tell him it's fine.
I'm on my way.

01:37.458 --> 01:38.833
Later.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.167
Captain.

01:42.958 --> 01:45.208
You want to tell me where you
learned that little move?

01:45.292 --> 01:48.125
Divine inspiration.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.833
Oh, and speaking
of divine inspiration, Edward..

01:51.917 --> 01:55.458
Edward, show the captain
what you showed me.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.667
Oh, I-I'm sure that the captain

01:57.750 --> 01:59.458
has better things
to do with his time.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.000
[chuckles]
Not anymore.

02:02.083 --> 02:03.542
What is it?

02:06.500 --> 02:08.125
Oh.

02:09.917 --> 02:12.125
Oh. This is beautiful.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.750
(Theo)
'I keep telling him
he should sell them.'

02:13.833 --> 02:16.375
A work of this quality
could fetch quite a price

02:16.458 --> 02:20.875
and...the order
could certainly use the money.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.042
But he insists

02:23.125 --> 02:24.875
on giving them away.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.083
The joy is first in the making
and then in the giving.

02:27.167 --> 02:30.208
I'm doubly blessed.
Do you really like it?

02:30.292 --> 02:31.542
Oh, absolutely.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.542
Well, then when I've finished,
it's yours.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.875
If-if you'll have it.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.625
I'd be honored.
Thank you.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.792
Great.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.083
[instrumental music]

03:12.500 --> 03:15.917
Ambassador.
You wanted to see me?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.417
Yes.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.583
Formality.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.625
Ritual.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.875
You should be informed.

03:24.958 --> 03:26.792
Informed of what?

03:27.917 --> 03:29.708
Returning.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.208
[instrumental music]

03:42.375 --> 03:45.458
Hello, commander.
I said I'd be back.

03:49.458 --> 03:54.583
(Ivanova)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

03:58.042 --> 03:59.333
It failed.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.542
[theme music]

04:14.042 --> 04:16.000
But in the year of
the shadow war

04:16.083 --> 04:18.375
it became something greater..

04:18.458 --> 04:20.458
Our last best hope..

04:20.542 --> 04:22.458
...for victory.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.333
[music continues]

04:26.750 --> 04:29.125
The year is 2260.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.792
The place, Babylon 5.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.375
[theme music]

05:01.625 --> 05:03.667
[music continues]

05:17.833 --> 05:19.958
So, when I left here a month ago

05:20.042 --> 05:21.750
I found a ship willing
to carry me

05:21.833 --> 05:23.833
to the border
of the Vorlon Empire.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.833
He wouldn't go any closer
than that.

05:25.917 --> 05:29.750
Smart man. No ship entering
Vorlon space has ever come back.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.250
Ever since I made contact
with Ambassador Kosh

05:32.333 --> 05:35.417
I've been called there.
I knew they'd let me in.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.333
- And did they?
- 'Not at first.'

05:38.417 --> 05:40.833
We held position for three days

05:40.917 --> 05:43.458
beaming a signal
into their territory.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.292
No answer.

05:45.375 --> 05:49.208
Finally, the pilot got nervous
and wanted to come back.

05:49.292 --> 05:53.000
I gave him the last of my money
in exchange for a life pod.

05:53.083 --> 05:57.250
He left me there with five days
of air, food, and water.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.125
[sighs]
The signal wasn't doing any good

05:59.208 --> 06:01.542
so I tried sending
a telepathic call

06:01.625 --> 06:03.917
out in every direction.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.083
Five days later,
I was lying on the floor

06:06.167 --> 06:11.625
the last of my air almost gone
when a ship came alongside.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.417
I must've passed out
at that point.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.042
The next thing I remember..

06:17.125 --> 06:18.958
I was on the Vorlon Homeworld.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.208
Well, come on.
Tell us about it.

06:21.292 --> 06:23.000
(Lyta)
I can't.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.542
I wish I could,
but I'm not allowed

06:24.625 --> 06:27.750
to talk about most
of what I saw.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.167
The rest you wouldn't
believe anyway.

06:30.250 --> 06:33.625
Ambassador Kosh says you'll be
working for him from now on.

06:33.708 --> 06:35.458
Was this a condition
for being released, or--

06:35.542 --> 06:37.458
It's entirely my decision.

06:37.542 --> 06:38.833
I'll be based here

06:38.917 --> 06:40.792
but I'll be gone
much of the time.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.333
You do realize that sooner
or later the Psi-Corps

06:42.417 --> 06:44.542
gonna find out
that you've come back.

06:44.625 --> 06:47.625
When that happens,
they'll come after you.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.958
If you're on your own we may
not be able to protect you.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.875
You don't have to.
He will.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.042
Well, either way,
you've been through a lot.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.292
Now you seem fine,
but I'd like Dr. Franklin

07:02.375 --> 07:04.833
to do a full work-up
just to be sure.

07:04.917 --> 07:08.042
- Unless you have an objection.
- No, not at all.

07:08.125 --> 07:11.167
I'll stop by as soon
as I've settled?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.708
Thank you.

07:17.542 --> 07:20.500
Nobody's ever been to the
Vorlon Homeworld and back again.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.958
Yet she goes and comes back,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.833
like she just took a trip
to the corner store.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.792
And now she's working for Kosh.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.333
Is anybody else as creeped out
about this as I am?

07:30.458 --> 07:33.208
[instrumental music]

07:33.292 --> 07:35.292
And we can handle

07:35.375 --> 07:37.417
all your data transfer
requirements

07:37.500 --> 07:40.458
for roughly half
of what you're paying currently.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.500
And you guarantee accuracy.

07:42.583 --> 07:43.750
In our order

07:43.833 --> 07:46.917
our work is an offering,
a kind of prayer

07:47.000 --> 07:49.583
so it has to be done properly.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.375
A thousand years ago
we were illuminating manuscripts

07:52.458 --> 07:55.542
transcribing the scriptures.
Now we do this.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.167
It earns us the money to
continue our primary work here.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.708
Which is?

07:59.792 --> 08:02.125
Learning all the names
and faces of God

08:02.208 --> 08:04.625
from our non-human brothers.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.208
Well, if it makes you happy

08:06.292 --> 08:08.500
and we get what we need

08:08.583 --> 08:10.333
who am I to argue?

08:10.417 --> 08:12.208
You can tell Brother Theo
you've got a deal.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.500
Thank you,
and you will be very pleased.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.625
I'll call the head office

08:16.708 --> 08:18.208
tell them to start
the paperwork.

08:18.292 --> 08:21.417
You should hear
from them in a few days.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.458
an interesting
good luck charm.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.833
- That's not mine.
- It fell from your bag.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.333
I don't remember
putting it there.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.667
I think I would have remembered
a black rose.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.542
Then it appears you have
a secret admirer.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.917
Good seeing you,
Brother Edward.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.667
(man over TV)
'Interplanetary Expeditions
is proud to sponsor'

08:50.750 --> 08:53.708
'this segment of interstellar
network news'

08:53.792 --> 08:57.708
'winners
of six platinum medals.'

08:57.792 --> 08:59.958
Mr. Garibaldi, I was hoping
you'd be here.

09:00.042 --> 09:01.833
- I need a favor.
- Shoot.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.417
A Minbari trade delegation
is coming here next week.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.792
I know it's very short notice,
but if you could provide them

09:06.875 --> 09:08.125
with added security..

09:08.208 --> 09:10.292
No problem. Consider it done.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.917
The Lester James Monroe
murder trial

09:12.000 --> 09:13.958
has finally come to an end.

09:14.042 --> 09:16.125
I've been waiting
for this story. Volume.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.792
The case concluded at 12:30 EST

09:18.875 --> 09:21.292
at which time the 12-person jury

09:21.375 --> 09:23.042
found Lester James Monroe guilty

09:23.125 --> 09:25.458
of seven murders committed
during a 10-day killing spree

09:25.542 --> 09:28.083
'in New Vegas.
Deliberations in the case..'

09:28.167 --> 09:31.417
Good. You wouldn't believe
how smug this guy was

09:31.500 --> 09:34.292
during the trial ambassador,
like nobody could touch him.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.792
But they finally nailed him,
that lying little rat-bastard.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.208
Monroe has been sentenced
to the death of personality.

09:40.292 --> 09:42.958
The mind-wipe will take place
Monday at midnight

09:43.042 --> 09:44.917
after which he will spend
the rest of his life

09:45.000 --> 09:47.708
serving the community
that he harmed.

09:47.792 --> 09:50.958
- In other news--
- Off.

09:51.042 --> 09:52.458
You know, guys like this
make me long

09:52.542 --> 09:54.375
for the days
of the electric chair.

09:54.458 --> 09:57.708
[chuckles]
Hell, sometimes I think
we need electric bleachers.

09:57.792 --> 10:01.000
What exactly is this
"Death of personality"?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.792
It started up
when everybody decided

10:02.875 --> 10:04.833
the death penalty
was a bad idea.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.125
Instead, they mind-wipe the guy.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.667
By erasing all his memories
you destroy the personality

10:09.750 --> 10:12.500
that committed the murders, you
then build a new personality

10:12.583 --> 10:14.333
and send him someplace
where he won't run

10:14.417 --> 10:16.292
into the family of his victims.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.292
And after that,
he spends the rest

10:18.375 --> 10:20.333
of his life
doing community service

10:20.417 --> 10:22.500
helping society.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.042
Well, they say it's more humane

10:24.125 --> 10:25.917
and keeps the prisons
from getting overcrowded.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.375
But you don't agree.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.708
Oh, I'm an eye-for-an-eye,
tooth-for-a-tooth

10:28.792 --> 10:30.208
kind of guy, ambassador.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.333
So you support the system
that would leave everyone

10:32.417 --> 10:34.583
blind and toothless.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.500
No, not everyone.

10:36.583 --> 10:38.083
Just the bad guys.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.250
(Stephen)
Breathe in, please.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.583
Hold it.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.833
And..

10:46.917 --> 10:48.042
...release.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.375
[exhales]

10:50.667 --> 10:52.750
- Interesting.
- What?

10:54.958 --> 10:59.125
I did a medical profile
on you just before you left.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.250
You've been through
a lot since then.

11:03.042 --> 11:06.458
Oxygen deprivation
stress, fatigue..

11:06.542 --> 11:08.000
But according to the scanners

11:08.083 --> 11:10.750
you're...in better health
than when you left.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.250
Hell, according to this file..

11:13.333 --> 11:15.792
...this is the best shape
you've been in for five years.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.958
I think you're exaggerating
just a little, doctor.

11:18.042 --> 11:21.208
Yeah? According to your record
you have..

11:21.292 --> 11:24.708
...a chronic iron deficiency.
It's a congenital condition.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.000
It's gone.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.250
Your enlarged appendix
is now normal size

11:28.333 --> 11:31.208
and a slight hiatal hernia
has somehow fixed itself.

11:31.292 --> 11:33.083
I'd love to know
how you did it.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.875
And I'd love to tell you, but I
honestly don't have any idea

11:35.958 --> 11:38.458
what you're talking about.

11:38.542 --> 11:39.875
Look..

11:39.958 --> 11:42.750
I'd love to stay and chat
but I've really got to

11:42.833 --> 11:44.375
unpack and get to work.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.875
Based on your examination
is there

11:45.958 --> 11:47.833
any reason I can't do that?

11:47.917 --> 11:50.125
No, not yet.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.792
There does seem to be
an unusually high level

11:51.875 --> 11:53.583
of oxygen in your bloodstream.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.375
Now, I can't quite see
why that's happening--

11:55.458 --> 11:56.750
Then I'd better get going.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.917
I don't want to keep
the ambassador waiting.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.333
Good to see you again,
Dr. Franklin.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.417
[dramatic music]

12:25.125 --> 12:26.583
I'm sorry to impose on you
personally for this

12:26.667 --> 12:28.875
Mr. Garibaldi, but I didn't want
to alarm Brother Theo

12:28.958 --> 12:30.292
and if others are brought
into this whole thing--

12:30.375 --> 12:31.583
Understood.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.917
There.
It's right there.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.542
[intense music]

12:39.875 --> 12:42.542
It was right here.
I saw it.

12:42.625 --> 12:46.000
Someone had written it.
Written in blood.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.792
Maybe it was the trick
of the lights.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.125
No. No, not this.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.500
I was standing right here.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.667
It said, "Death walks
among you."

12:54.750 --> 12:56.500
I know what I saw.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.000
Alright. Alright, you say
it was there, it was there.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.708
I'll get you into
another quarters for tonight

13:01.792 --> 13:04.500
and, uh, my people will go
over this place tomorrow

13:04.583 --> 13:07.333
see what they can find.
Is that okay?

13:07.417 --> 13:09.667
- Okay.
- Alright.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.250
[beeps]

13:23.667 --> 13:27.250
Lyta.. Lyta Alexander!

13:27.333 --> 13:29.125
As I live and breathe!

13:29.208 --> 13:31.375
I suggest you remove your hand,
ambassador

13:31.458 --> 13:33.667
or you won't be doing either
for much longer.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.000
I'm just surprised
to see you that's all.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.875
Do you know
that I was thinking about you

13:38.958 --> 13:40.375
just the other day?

13:40.458 --> 13:43.042
My extremely overpaid sources

13:43.125 --> 13:46.333
told me that you had been
seen arriving here

13:46.417 --> 13:48.833
in a Vorlon transport.

13:48.917 --> 13:52.625
Now, they are a profoundly
unreliable pool of information

13:52.708 --> 13:57.250
on the best of days, so I said,
"No, it cannot be her."

13:57.333 --> 14:00.958
The Vorlons do not pick
up hitchhikers

14:01.042 --> 14:03.500
not even one
as attractive as you.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.583
Besides, if it were you

14:05.667 --> 14:07.708
surely you would come by

14:07.792 --> 14:11.958
and say hello
to your old friend Londo.

14:12.042 --> 14:14.417
- I'm sorry, ambassador--
- No. Londo, please.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.583
But I'm really very late.
If you'll excuse me.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.833
You have been to the
Vorlon Homeworld, haven't you?

14:21.917 --> 14:24.333
I would pay
a great deal of money

14:24.417 --> 14:25.750
for an hour of your time

14:25.833 --> 14:27.708
to find out
what you have seen there.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.167
Oh!

14:29.250 --> 14:32.708
Lyta, I understand the Psi-Corps
is looking for you!

14:34.333 --> 14:37.083
I would hate very much
for them to find you.

14:39.375 --> 14:42.125
So would I.

14:42.208 --> 14:46.125
Because I'm not
with the Corps anymore.

14:46.208 --> 14:49.667
That means I'm not bound
by their rules.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.958
So if someone were
to turn me in

14:52.042 --> 14:53.708
I'd find him.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.458
And before they took me

14:55.542 --> 14:57.375
I'd plant a nightmare
deep in his mind

14:57.458 --> 14:59.792
where no one else could
find or remove it

14:59.875 --> 15:01.667
and that person
would spend every night

15:01.750 --> 15:03.458
for the rest of his life..

15:03.542 --> 15:05.333
...screaming.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.625
Fine!

15:09.708 --> 15:11.875
And keep your threats
to yourself!

15:14.125 --> 15:16.250
Nightmares. Huh.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.083
The way my life
has been going lately..

15:20.167 --> 15:22.083
...who'd notice?

15:24.083 --> 15:26.083
I really appreciate
your taking this time

15:26.167 --> 15:28.500
to see me, Ambassador Delenn.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.000
Among my people,
it is considered an honor

15:31.083 --> 15:33.500
to aid any true seeker
in his quest.

15:33.583 --> 15:37.167
- Do you mind if I record?
- No, not at all.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.000
So, can you tell me a little bit

15:40.083 --> 15:42.583
about what your people believe?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.083
Um, it is, um..

15:45.167 --> 15:47.208
It is very hard to explain.

15:47.292 --> 15:50.833
We do not believe
in any individual God or Gods..

15:50.917 --> 15:54.750
...but rather, we believe
that the soul is, uh..

15:54.833 --> 15:56.708
What is a good term?

15:56.792 --> 15:59.250
A non-localized phenomenon.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.375
I'm not sure I understand
what that means.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.458
Well, if I project
a beam of light

16:07.542 --> 16:09.708
at the wall, you see the light

16:09.792 --> 16:11.250
on the wall.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.458
But the wall is not the source
of the light.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.708
It comes in
from somewhere else.

16:15.792 --> 16:18.375
The soul is also a projection.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.542
It does not exist inside us

16:20.625 --> 16:23.500
any more than the light exists
inside the wall.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.417
But...this shell
is the only way

16:27.500 --> 16:28.667
'we can perceive it.'

16:28.750 --> 16:31.083
We believe
that the universe itself

16:31.167 --> 16:33.917
is conscious in a way we can
never truly understand.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It is engaged
in a search for meaning.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.708
So it breaks itself apart

16:39.792 --> 16:41.542
investing its own consciousness

16:41.625 --> 16:43.458
in every form of life.

16:43.542 --> 16:47.458
We are the universe trying
to understand itself.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.250
May I..

16:49.333 --> 16:51.500
May I ask you
a question now?

16:51.583 --> 16:53.500
Of course.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.375
For you, personally

16:55.458 --> 16:58.167
what is the defining moment
of your belief?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.750
Not the history, the doctrines..

17:00.833 --> 17:02.750
...but the emotional core of it?

17:03.958 --> 17:05.458
Well..

17:07.667 --> 17:12.625
On the night
before our Lord was crucified

17:12.708 --> 17:16.208
he spent the night alone
in the garden of Gethsemane.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.750
And he knew that they were
gonna come for him

17:19.833 --> 17:21.750
and in a moment of weakness
he asked

17:21.833 --> 17:25.000
if this cup
could pass from him

17:25.083 --> 17:27.042
if he could be spared the pain

17:27.125 --> 17:30.458
and death that would come
with the morning.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.375
And of course,
the cup would not pass

17:32.458 --> 17:34.625
and the soldiers would come
to Gethsemane

17:34.708 --> 17:39.500
but he did not have
to be there when they arrived.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.750
He could have chosen to leave..

17:42.833 --> 17:47.833
...to postpone the inevitable
for a few hours or even days.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.625
He knew what would happen

17:50.708 --> 17:52.958
but he chose to stay

17:53.042 --> 17:55.125
to sacrifice himself

17:55.208 --> 17:58.083
and thus atone
for the sins of others.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.292
It's a very..

18:00.375 --> 18:03.333
...fragile human moment.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.958
'And I've...often thought
about that night.'

18:08.750 --> 18:10.500
And I..

18:10.583 --> 18:12.250
...honestly..

18:14.250 --> 18:15.292
...don't know

18:15.375 --> 18:17.542
if I would have had the courage

18:17.625 --> 18:19.750
to have stayed.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.000
[instrumental music]

18:27.292 --> 18:31.875
Again, I would like to thank you
for your time, ambassador.

18:31.958 --> 18:35.958
Perhaps, uh, we could continue
our discussion in a few days.

18:36.042 --> 18:39.417
I would very much like to hear
about Valen sometime.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.667
- I would like that.
- As would I.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.500
Valen was the greatest of us.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.667
A thousand years ago,
he came from nowhere

18:45.750 --> 18:48.375
formed the grey council,
and brought peace to our people.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.458
They say he was a Minbari
not born of Minbari.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.875
- According to the--
- Another time, Lennier.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.333
I'm sure Brother Edward
is tired.

18:56.417 --> 18:58.875
Well, I-I am a bit.

18:58.958 --> 19:02.500
Again, I want
to thank both of you.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.708
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.667
Brown 17, please.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.167
[beeps]

19:31.333 --> 19:33.042
Sorry.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.792
It's alright.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.917
(female #2)
'Aah!'

19:38.000 --> 19:40.375
'Aah!'

19:40.458 --> 19:42.875
Hello? Hello?

19:42.958 --> 19:47.542
(female #2)
'Help me! Please, someone,
in God's name!'

19:47.625 --> 19:48.625
'Aah!'

19:48.708 --> 19:50.417
[high-pitched whirring]

19:52.292 --> 19:54.417
(female #2)
'Aah!'

19:54.500 --> 19:56.667
'Aah!'

19:56.750 --> 19:59.458
[woman crying]

19:59.542 --> 20:03.083
(male #1)
'Hey, Charlie..
Why'd you do it?'

20:03.167 --> 20:04.583
'You killed her!'

20:04.667 --> 20:07.292
- 'Charlie, Charlie..'
- 'You killed me.'

20:07.375 --> 20:11.083
- 'Charlie.'
- 'Charlie!'

20:11.167 --> 20:13.417
(male #1)
'Hey, Charlie.'

20:13.500 --> 20:15.250
(female #2)
'Charlie!'

20:19.583 --> 20:21.292
- 'Charlie!'
- 'Charlie!'

20:21.375 --> 20:23.292
(male #1)
'Charlie?'

20:23.375 --> 20:25.333
(female #2)
'Charlie!'

20:31.208 --> 20:33.208
Uhh!

20:38.417 --> 20:39.500
[dog barks]

20:39.583 --> 20:41.292
[dog howls]

20:43.333 --> 20:45.875
[intense music]

20:53.792 --> 20:56.833
[police siren]

21:06.958 --> 21:10.000
[dramatic music]

21:17.625 --> 21:20.167
[dramatic music]

21:34.917 --> 21:37.500
[police siren wailing]

21:44.958 --> 21:47.500
[music continues]

22:06.167 --> 22:08.542
(Theo)
Edward, here you are.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.333
We missed you
at morning prayer.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.667
I'm sorry. I forgot.

22:16.583 --> 22:22.042
- Are you alright?
- No. No, I'm not.

22:22.125 --> 22:24.792
Things have been
happening, Theo.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.250
Terrible things,
and I don't know

22:26.333 --> 22:28.917
if they're real or in my head.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.125
[exhales]
Last night,
in the hall near here

22:31.208 --> 22:35.083
I saw some things,
and they really frightened me.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.083
I lost the bag.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.500
The one you gave me. I'm sorry.

22:40.583 --> 22:42.250
Oh, a bag can be replaced.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.500
Right now, I'm more concerned
with you.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.583
Have you spoken to anyone else
about this?

22:48.667 --> 22:51.500
Mr. Garibaldi, but I don't think
he can help me.

22:51.583 --> 22:52.750
I'm..

22:52.833 --> 22:54.917
I'm having..

22:55.000 --> 22:57.125
...memories.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.833
Memories of things
I never did

22:59.917 --> 23:01.542
or-or thought I never did.

23:01.625 --> 23:05.000
I-I don't know where they're
coming from or what they mean--

23:05.083 --> 23:08.792
Then perhaps it's best
to leave them alone.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.833
I can't.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.333
I don't know
if I'm losing my mind or..

23:13.417 --> 23:15.208
Or what?

23:19.917 --> 23:22.000
Nothing. Nothing.

23:22.083 --> 23:23.917
Never mind.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.458
Do you want me to stay
with you a while?

23:32.542 --> 23:35.625
No, no, it's alright. I'm fine.

23:54.625 --> 23:57.167
[instrumental music]

23:57.250 --> 24:01.667
Computer...cross-reference
and analyze.

24:01.750 --> 24:06.875
Items, the phrase,
"Death walks among you"

24:06.958 --> 24:09.250
a black rose

24:09.333 --> 24:14.333
a name, Charlie or Charles

24:14.417 --> 24:18.458
a death, woman, murdered.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.042
Check criminal records on Earth

24:21.125 --> 24:23.333
and associated colonies.

24:23.417 --> 24:28.083
(computer)
'Processing, time required
for comprehensive analysis..'

24:28.167 --> 24:30.250
'...four hours.'

24:37.417 --> 24:39.917
You wanted to see me?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.542
Yes, captain.

24:42.625 --> 24:47.000
One of my monks
is having bad dreams.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.292
Well, he has my sympathies,
but I don't see what I can do--

24:52.375 --> 24:56.750
He believes they are memories
he cannot account for.

24:56.833 --> 25:00.542
Memories of terrible things
he may have done in the past.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.458
When someone joins the order
in New Mallory

25:05.542 --> 25:09.042
we tend not to inquire
too deeply into their past.

25:10.417 --> 25:12.083
Their reasons for joining, yes.

25:12.167 --> 25:15.375
Their motives,
their doctrinal beliefs..

25:15.458 --> 25:18.000
But our resources are limited
and we often rely

25:18.083 --> 25:21.583
on the word of those
who come to us.

25:21.667 --> 25:26.417
For eight years, Brother Edward
has been the best of us.

25:26.500 --> 25:30.375
He's been kind and gentle.

25:30.458 --> 25:32.333
He's given aid and comfort

25:32.417 --> 25:33.833
to anyone who has required it

25:33.917 --> 25:36.292
without hesitation
or expectation.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.458
He is a good and decent man.

25:39.542 --> 25:41.083
I would hate for him to discover

25:41.167 --> 25:45.292
that at some earlier time
in his life

25:45.375 --> 25:48.292
he was something very different.

25:48.375 --> 25:51.458
I-I can't believe it. Not him.

25:51.542 --> 25:53.958
Neither can I.

25:54.042 --> 25:57.042
And I hope..

25:57.125 --> 25:59.708
I pray that I am wrong.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.542
But I do not have the resources
to find out.

26:06.083 --> 26:08.125
You do.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.625
If I know Edward

26:09.708 --> 26:13.542
he's certainly started digging
into this on his own.

26:13.625 --> 26:17.167
I need you to get there first.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.250
'If it's nothing,
then he's simply'

26:19.333 --> 26:21.333
under too much stress.

26:22.542 --> 26:25.667
If there is something
in his past

26:27.333 --> 26:30.625
we can work with him
to overcome it.

26:30.708 --> 26:33.375
We must get to the truth
before he does

26:33.458 --> 26:36.333
or I fear for his life..

26:36.417 --> 26:38.542
...and his sanity.

26:38.625 --> 26:41.167
[intense music]

26:48.208 --> 26:49.833
Brother Edward?

26:52.375 --> 26:54.625
Are you okay?

26:54.708 --> 26:57.250
I lost my bag somewhere
around here.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.333
Uh, there was a Centauri.

26:59.417 --> 27:02.125
Perhaps he...saw it.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.458
And then voices..

27:04.542 --> 27:05.917
But he wasn't here then

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
and then the words
were right here, Mr. Garibaldi

27:09.083 --> 27:11.583
in blood, the same
as in my quarters.

27:13.208 --> 27:14.792
Yeah.

27:14.875 --> 27:18.000
Look, uh, we got
a preliminary report

27:18.083 --> 27:19.792
back on that.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.667
The lab couldn't find any trace
of blood on your wall.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.542
I've got them checking
for anything else

27:24.625 --> 27:27.708
but, uh, I just thought
you should know.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.875
Tell them not to bother.

27:29.958 --> 27:33.250
Why would an uneasy conscience
show up in a lab report?

27:35.625 --> 27:37.208
- Is Brother Theo--
- Yeah-yeah.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.458
He's...occupied elsewhere.

27:39.542 --> 27:43.042
I'll be sure to tell him
that you have asked after him.

27:43.125 --> 27:44.875
Uh, thanks.

27:44.958 --> 27:47.292
I'll, uh, put out the word
about your bag.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.833
If somebody swiped it,
we'll find it

27:48.917 --> 27:50.500
when they try to sell it.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.208
Of course. Thank you.

27:54.375 --> 27:57.417
[dramatic music]

28:11.208 --> 28:12.833
(computer)
'Analysis complete.'

28:12.917 --> 28:14.500
'Match found.'

28:14.583 --> 28:17.750
'Date, April 3, 2251.'

28:17.833 --> 28:21.542
'Location, Earth colony three
in Orion system.'

28:21.625 --> 28:23.125
Show me.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.542
At 12:05 tonight
the death of personality

28:25.625 --> 28:27.667
was carried out
against Charles Dexter

28:27.750 --> 28:30.083
'also known
as the Black Rose Killer'

28:30.167 --> 28:31.542
for the ritualistic mark

28:31.625 --> 28:33.750
left beside each
of his victims.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.625
'Nine people were
murdered by Dexter'

28:35.708 --> 28:38.667
'before he was found,
arrested, and convicted.'

28:38.750 --> 28:40.500
'Following the mind-wipe
Dexter will be'

28:40.583 --> 28:42.833
'transported out
of the Orion system'

28:42.917 --> 28:45.208
'and put to work
serving the society'

28:45.292 --> 28:47.500
'harmed by his actions.'

28:50.167 --> 28:52.208
[dramatic music]

28:56.625 --> 28:58.292
Captain, we just finished
going over the records.

28:58.375 --> 29:01.125
It's confirmed, Brother Edward
was originally Charles Dexter

29:01.208 --> 29:03.375
'also known as
the Black Rose Killer.'

29:05.000 --> 29:08.417
What happened? How did he end up
in a monastery?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.625
After they erased his memory
they transferred him

29:10.708 --> 29:12.667
to an interim facility
back home.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.125
Apparently, there was a fire,
and he was presumed killed.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.958
'Obviously he survived
with a new set of memories'

29:17.042 --> 29:19.167
and a personality programmed
to serve society.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.042
What better place to serve
than in a religious order?

29:22.125 --> 29:24.333
(Garibaldi)
'Exactly. Oh, captain,
one other thing.'

29:24.417 --> 29:27.042
According to station records
the black rose archives

29:27.125 --> 29:29.250
were accessed
about five hours ago

29:29.333 --> 29:30.750
the computer signature
was the system

29:30.833 --> 29:33.167
in Brother Edward's quarters.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.375
He knows.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.667
- 'Theo?'
- Edward?

29:41.750 --> 29:46.375
Edward, what are you doing?
We've been looking for you.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.167
You have to come with me.

29:49.250 --> 29:53.583
I can't.
I can't go back, Theo.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.208
How could they do it?
They say it's humane?

29:57.292 --> 29:59.250
Merciful?

29:59.333 --> 30:01.250
Do you know what it's like
to wake up one day

30:01.333 --> 30:04.500
and discover you're a monster?
A murderer?

30:04.583 --> 30:09.042
Listen to me, Edward.
We can work this out.

30:09.125 --> 30:12.542
No. It's too late. What if..

30:12.625 --> 30:17.250
What if I had died, Theo,
never knowing what I had been?

30:17.333 --> 30:19.875
How can I confess my sins to God

30:19.958 --> 30:23.917
if I don't even know
what they are?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.042
The mind forgets

30:26.125 --> 30:29.875
but the stain remains
with the soul.

30:29.958 --> 30:35.917
The blood of innocent people
is still on my hands.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.375
My memories are the creation

30:38.458 --> 30:41.583
of somebody else
and my soul is the soul

30:41.667 --> 30:47.083
of a killer and everything
that I have done has been a lie.

30:47.167 --> 30:49.583
That's not true, Edward!

30:49.667 --> 30:53.000
You've helped people,
cared for people.

30:53.083 --> 30:56.083
It's not enough.

30:56.167 --> 30:58.958
Who knows what other crimes
I may have committed

30:59.042 --> 31:03.167
that they never found out about
that I don't remember?

31:04.667 --> 31:07.458
I am a murderer, Theo.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.750
The sins of my former life

31:10.833 --> 31:13.458
must be atoned for.

31:13.542 --> 31:16.458
There must be justice.

31:16.542 --> 31:20.333
- I know that now.
- Edward. Edward!

31:22.250 --> 31:25.458
If you ask God
to forgive your sins

31:25.542 --> 31:29.333
he knows what they are
even if you've forgotten.

31:30.708 --> 31:33.000
Leave it in his hands.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.042
Goodbye, Theo.

31:42.417 --> 31:43.958
Hey, I got somethin'.

31:44.042 --> 31:45.792
We just picked this up from
a guy trying to sell this down

31:45.875 --> 31:48.292
in the bazaar.
It's Brother Edward's bag.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.792
And he forgot to turn off
his comp-pad

31:49.875 --> 31:52.125
after talking to Delenn.
It's a good thing, too.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.833
It recorded voices
in the hallway

31:53.917 --> 31:55.958
voices Edward thought
were just in his head.

31:56.042 --> 31:57.625
So I had my people
check the area.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.375
Somebody tapped
into the PA System

31:59.458 --> 32:00.667
and used it to rattle him.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.500
We also found traces
of a chemical on the wall

32:02.583 --> 32:04.125
of his quarters
that would look like blood

32:04.208 --> 32:06.333
for a few minutes
then disappear.

32:08.042 --> 32:10.042
Someone's here.

32:10.125 --> 32:12.083
Someone who wants him
to remember.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.667
But that's not enough.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.833
To shake a mind-wipe like this
you'd need more..

32:16.917 --> 32:18.792
- You'd need--
- A telepath?

32:18.875 --> 32:20.208
Yeah.

32:20.292 --> 32:22.417
But Psi-Corps has rules
against breaking mind-wipes.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.833
It would have to be alien.

32:23.917 --> 32:25.542
Brother Edward said
a Centauri bumped into him

32:25.625 --> 32:26.917
just before he went nuts.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.375
Centauri don't hang
around Downbelow.

32:29.458 --> 32:30.958
Get ahold of Londo,
he's bound to have a list

32:31.042 --> 32:33.000
of all Centauri telepaths
on-station.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.792
You got it.

32:34.875 --> 32:36.708
I can't believe this.

32:36.792 --> 32:39.500
But who would want to do this
to Brother Edward deliberately?

32:39.583 --> 32:41.042
What would they gonna get
out of it?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.583
Maybe the one thing
they thought they didn't get

32:42.667 --> 32:46.083
when he was mind-wiped
instead of executed..

32:46.167 --> 32:47.625
Revenge.

32:47.708 --> 32:50.125
[instrumental music]

33:04.292 --> 33:06.833
[liturgical music]

33:17.792 --> 33:20.167
I knew you would come.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.083
We came, alright.

33:27.167 --> 33:29.917
It took us nine years
to find you.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.042
But we finally ran you
to ground.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.750
Look around.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.917
You know who we are?

33:39.167 --> 33:41.208
I think so.

33:42.708 --> 33:45.333
You're the sons
and-and daughters

33:45.417 --> 33:48.917
and husbands of the women
I murdered.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.125
You escaped justice before.

33:51.208 --> 33:53.792
You didn't pay for what you did

33:53.875 --> 33:55.958
but that's going to change.

33:56.042 --> 33:59.250
But we wanted you to know
what you had done.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.500
We wanted you
to remember it all

34:01.583 --> 34:04.500
so that you'd know
why we did it.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.292
So that it'd be fresh
in your mind

34:06.375 --> 34:08.875
when you got to hell.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.583
And now that we're here

34:10.667 --> 34:14.792
they don't have the guts
to do what is necessary..

34:14.875 --> 34:18.000
...but I do.
Get up.

34:18.083 --> 34:21.167
[instrumental music]

34:28.833 --> 34:30.625
Who hired you?

34:30.708 --> 34:34.792
Sorry. That information
is confidential.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.750
[scoffs]
They're going to kill him,
aren't they?

34:36.833 --> 34:40.917
It's none of my concern. I did
a job. That's the end of it.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.625
You helped break down
the mind-wipe so he'd remember.

34:43.708 --> 34:47.958
Difficult assignment.
The wipe was very complete.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.917
'Fortunately, there's
a great deal of redundancy'

34:50.000 --> 34:51.542
in the brain.

34:51.625 --> 34:54.250
You just need to know
human neuro-pathways well enough

34:54.333 --> 34:58.125
to be able to find them
and stimulate them.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.625
Look, we're running out of time.

34:59.708 --> 35:01.083
Now, you're gonna tell me
who they are?

35:01.167 --> 35:04.500
- And where they are or--
- Or what?

35:04.583 --> 35:08.708
What are you going to do,
torture it out of me?

35:08.792 --> 35:10.375
Not likely.

35:10.458 --> 35:12.708
You have no jurisdiction
over Centauri telepaths

35:12.792 --> 35:14.750
so you can't arrest me

35:14.833 --> 35:16.167
and you can't use
another telepath

35:16.250 --> 35:18.417
to pull the information
out of my brain.

35:18.500 --> 35:22.500
Because your Psi-Corps has rules
forbidding such activities.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.708
Then we have a little surprise
for you.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.083
[intense music]

35:29.167 --> 35:31.167
[grunts]

35:35.542 --> 35:37.458
Do it.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.583
- Aah!
- Let it go!

35:45.208 --> 35:49.292
Let it go, or I'll fry
every synapse you've got!

35:49.375 --> 35:51.375
Aah! Aah!

35:53.625 --> 35:56.375
Sorry. He'll be fine.
He just passed out.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.208
Brown 42. They're in Brown 42.

36:04.125 --> 36:05.958
[exhales]

36:09.792 --> 36:10.958
Okay, that way.

36:11.042 --> 36:12.125
Let's go over there
and split up.

36:12.208 --> 36:13.708
Let's search by quarters.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.000
[intense music]

36:22.375 --> 36:26.792
Oh, dear God.
In here! Someone, help!

36:26.875 --> 36:28.667
In here!

36:34.458 --> 36:37.875
Med alert. Brown 42.
We need a trauma team, stat!

36:44.750 --> 36:48.417
- I got it.
- Okay. Okay.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.083
Easy.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.333
- Okay.
- Got him?

36:54.417 --> 36:57.000
- Yeah.
- Alright. Nice and easy.

36:57.083 --> 37:00.750
Nice and easy. Lay him down.
Lay him down.

37:00.833 --> 37:02.292
Okay.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.000
I.. Theo..

37:08.333 --> 37:10.958
Don't, don't move, Edward.
Help is on the way.

37:12.417 --> 37:14.250
It's alright, Theo.

37:15.875 --> 37:18.458
I knew what was going to happen.

37:18.542 --> 37:20.750
I even waited for them to come
so..

37:20.833 --> 37:23.708
...forgive them for doing
what had to be done.

37:26.042 --> 37:28.833
I always wanted to know

37:28.917 --> 37:31.792
if I would have the courage

37:31.875 --> 37:34.875
to stay
at the garden of Gethsemane.

37:34.958 --> 37:37.750
[breathing heavily]

37:37.833 --> 37:39.917
Now I know, Theo.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.333
Now I know.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.875
Captain, there's something
you should see.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.708
We caught him trying
to sneaking out of back ways.

37:57.792 --> 38:00.333
He's got blood
on his hands and shirt.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.667
- You did this?
- Yeah. I don't deny it!

38:03.750 --> 38:06.500
He had it comin'
after all these years.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.917
- That murdering son of a--
- Captain! Captain! Back off!

38:10.000 --> 38:12.208
Get him down
to lockup now! Move it!

38:12.292 --> 38:14.833
Captain, calm down.
Calm down.

38:18.958 --> 38:21.500
[instrumental music]

38:26.375 --> 38:28.083
(Edward)
Theo..

38:29.292 --> 38:31.708
I'm afraid.

38:31.792 --> 38:34.417
Is there enough forgiveness
for what I've done?

38:34.500 --> 38:39.625
Always, Edward.
Always.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.125
Take my hand.

38:42.208 --> 38:44.125
[breathing heavily]

38:46.250 --> 38:49.375
Through the mysteries
of our redemption

38:49.458 --> 38:51.208
may Almighty God release you

38:51.292 --> 38:53.917
from all punishments
in this life

38:54.000 --> 38:57.083
and in the life to come.

38:57.167 --> 39:01.375
May he open to you
the gates of paradise

39:01.458 --> 39:05.708
and welcome you
to everlasting joy.

39:05.792 --> 39:09.917
Father, look with compassion
on your servant Edward

39:10.000 --> 39:13.042
'who has trusted
in your promises.'

39:13.125 --> 39:16.958
Welcome him
to your kingdom in peace.

39:17.042 --> 39:21.458
By the authority which
the Apostolic See has given me..

39:21.542 --> 39:23.917
...I grant you a full pardon

39:24.000 --> 39:26.708
and remission of all your sins

39:26.792 --> 39:30.250
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son

39:30.333 --> 39:32.417
and of the Holy Spirit.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.375
Amen.

39:39.208 --> 39:40.708
(Susan)
'Welcome back.
That was a short trip.'

39:40.792 --> 39:42.958
The ambassador's errands
aren't usually very complicated.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.333
Thank you for keeping
the area clear.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.500
Oh, not a problem,
keeping all this off the logs

39:46.583 --> 39:48.583
that's a problem,
but I can deal with it.

39:48.667 --> 39:50.625
Hey, speaking of ambassadors
we've had several inquiries

39:50.708 --> 39:52.750
from Londo, it seems
he was quite upset

39:52.833 --> 39:54.167
about some unnamed telepath

39:54.250 --> 39:56.250
that was abusing one of his own
a couple of weeks ago.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.875
We told him what we could,
I think it'll be okay.

39:58.958 --> 40:00.500
What about the man
who murdered Brother Edward

40:00.583 --> 40:01.875
is he going to trial?

40:01.958 --> 40:04.125
Oh, that's long over.
He didn't even try to deny it.

40:04.208 --> 40:05.833
Hell, he was proud
of what he had done.

40:05.917 --> 40:08.917
They pronounced sentence
a few days ago.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.750
So what happened?

40:10.833 --> 40:13.042
(Theo)
I was going through
Edward's effects

40:13.125 --> 40:15.792
when I found this.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.625
I know he wanted you to have it.

40:18.708 --> 40:23.125
I'm afraid he never
had the chance to finish it.

40:23.208 --> 40:26.000
You take away a man's life
and memory

40:26.083 --> 40:29.000
in payment for his crimes.

40:29.083 --> 40:31.167
It's still not enough.

40:34.583 --> 40:37.042
Where does revenge end
and justice begin?

40:39.458 --> 40:42.083
Forgiveness is a hard thing,
isn't it, Theo?

40:42.167 --> 40:46.000
I don't think anything
can ever be more difficult.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.792
I'll keep this
in a place of honor.

40:49.417 --> 40:51.958
Thank you.

40:52.042 --> 40:55.583
Brother Theo,
I'm ready to go now.

40:55.667 --> 40:59.042
Good. Good.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.833
I'll walk you to your ship.

41:02.458 --> 41:05.458
Captain, this
is Brother Malcolm.

41:05.542 --> 41:07.292
'He has just joined the order'

41:07.375 --> 41:09.708
'under most unusual
circumstances.'

41:09.792 --> 41:12.708
I asked for him specifically

41:12.792 --> 41:16.708
when I heard he wanted
to serve others.

41:16.792 --> 41:19.375
He's about to leave
for the monastery back home

41:19.458 --> 41:24.667
where he'll be trained
and trained well.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.292
It is all that I've wanted
to do my whole life

41:27.375 --> 41:29.500
as long as I can remember.

41:29.583 --> 41:33.042
It is an honor
to meet you, captain.

41:33.125 --> 41:35.375
I've heard so much about you.

41:35.458 --> 41:39.208
You must excuse
the captain, Malcolm.

41:39.292 --> 41:42.542
You interrupted
his train of thought.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.000
I believe you were saying

41:44.083 --> 41:46.583
that forgiveness
is a hard thing

41:46.667 --> 41:50.208
but something ever
to strive for.

41:51.833 --> 41:53.417
Were you not, captain?

41:55.042 --> 41:56.583
Yes.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.042
Yes, I was.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.000
Good luck to you.

42:05.083 --> 42:07.500
I hope things work out.

42:07.583 --> 42:09.458
I'm sure it will.
Thank you, sir.

42:09.542 --> 42:12.958
We must be going along now.
You'll miss your flight.
