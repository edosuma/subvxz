13:43.470 --> 13:45.240
Ah, is it today?

13:45.240 --> 13:47.840
What's he working hard for since we have the Law of Specialist Physicians.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.610
Why hasn't he shown himself yet?

13:49.610 --> 13:50.880
He is absent on the first day.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.980
You'll have to bring him here.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.010
I will.

13:54.010 --> 13:56.410
But what's with the look on your face?

13:56.410 --> 14:00.080
What, are you upset that a patient has been declared dead so early in the morning?

14:00.690 --> 14:02.320
No, I'm not.

14:02.920 --> 14:03.860
But how do you know?

14:03.860 --> 14:05.060
I saw it on the way in.

14:05.060 --> 14:07.160
The patient was in unwitnessed cardiac arrest.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.030
[Unwitnessed arrest: No witnessed cardiac arrest]

14:07.160 --> 14:09.030
He was in the hospital for 30 minutes and didn't respond.

14:09.030 --> 14:11.300
That's the end of it, isn't it?

14:24.210 --> 14:25.240
What about ECMO?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.140
Did not use that.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.450
Well done.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.910
ECMO Priming costs 3 million at a time

14:27.780 --> 14:30.510
[ECMO Priming: ECMO catheter filled with liquid]

14:28.910 --> 14:30.510
It is disposable.

14:30.510 --> 14:33.420
Why waste money when it's useless anyway?

14:33.420 --> 14:35.090
Well done.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.000
You are Professor Cha Yeong Min, right?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.400
I've heard a lot about you.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.940
They say you are the best doctor in our hospital.

14:52.940 --> 14:56.540
Yes, indeed, you are?

14:58.540 --> 15:01.750
You've got the hands of a god.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.150
They're unexpectedly beautiful.

15:04.150 --> 15:06.380
I'm usually good at managing them.

15:06.380 --> 15:09.950
But... who are you?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.990
A president once said

15:11.990 --> 15:14.960
one genius feeds 100,000 people.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.260
Wait a minute.
Our hospital has 2,000 permanent medical staff

15:18.260 --> 15:20.830
and 5,800 general employees, that is about 8,000 in total.

15:20.830 --> 15:24.800
Wow, Professor Cha could feed 10 hospitals!

15:24.800 --> 15:25.400
Oh...

15:25.400 --> 15:28.210
ECMO costs 3 million a time. That's a general employee's salary.

15:28.210 --> 15:32.540
So if you save ten times, you can earn the annual salary of an employee.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.750
What's up?

15:34.750 --> 15:35.780
Who are you?

15:35.780 --> 15:40.250
So eminent, but I have heard that he has a sharp personality.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.390
You're...

15:41.390 --> 15:44.060
That's the personality of a genius, privilege and charm.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.560
Aristotle said

15:45.560 --> 15:48.160
there is no such thing as a genius without a little bit of arrogance.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.930
It takes a whole hospital to cultivate a genius.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.270
After all, he has medical skills of a god.

15:55.270 --> 15:59.540
If you have a problem, you can always come to me.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.080
Hello, bro.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.320
You guys go ahead.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.130
Bro, where's the locker?

16:21.130 --> 16:23.290
It's over there.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.600
That's right.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.970
I will start working with you today.

16:33.970 --> 16:37.880
Doctor Go Seung Tak.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.440
Please take care of me in the future.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.390
Oh, please...

16:52.360 --> 16:54.930
Is that the new guy who's coming today?

16:56.630 --> 16:59.530
Who is he?

16:59.530 --> 17:02.630
Hey, who's that guy?

17:31.060 --> 17:32.900
You know him, don't you?

17:32.900 --> 17:35.930
Since when? Since where?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.000
How much do you know about him?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.570
I knew him from school.

17:38.570 --> 17:41.010
I don't know much, only a little.

17:41.010 --> 17:44.080
Work hard. Did you teach him?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.110
How dare I?

17:46.110 --> 17:48.750
I just gave him some information.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.150
Information? What information?

17:52.150 --> 17:53.350
Information about arrogance?

17:53.350 --> 17:54.720
I am wronged.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.920
I'm the biggest victim.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.890
Go Seung Tak.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.330
You don't mean that "they told me" Go Seung Tak, do you?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.390
Does Dr. I know him too?

18:03.390 --> 18:06.130
I've only heard of him.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.800
He had an interview when he came as an intern.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.270
It's a legend.

18:10.270 --> 18:14.070
We ask superficial questions at the internship interview.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.640
[EunSang University Medical Center]

18:14.070 --> 18:16.010
Why did you become a doctor

18:16.010 --> 18:17.940
I wanted to help suffering patients.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.710
I wanted to save people's lives.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.550
People said superficial things.

18:23.550 --> 18:24.580
Here's what he said:

18:24.580 --> 18:28.720
Grandpa told me to be a doctor, Mom told me to be a doctor.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.260
So, Grandpa is the President of our consortium.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.760
Mum is the Chairman of the Board.

18:34.230 --> 18:36.090
[Qualified]

18:38.160 --> 18:41.330
Why is there a parachute in the 21st century?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.370
21st century what?

18:46.370 --> 18:49.810
What if specialists demonstrate?

18:49.810 --> 18:52.110
What kind of society is this these days? How dare you?

18:52.110 --> 18:52.880
Let's withdraw it.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.910
Number one in the department.

18:53.910 --> 18:55.050
Number one in the internship evaluation.

18:55.050 --> 18:55.910
If this is a parachute,

18:55.910 --> 18:57.150
Prof. Cha is also a parachute.

18:57.150 --> 18:59.320
You helped with the internship scores.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.150
Since when are specialists selected on the basis of their departmental scores?

19:02.150 --> 19:03.890
What about human nature, sense of mission, sense of life?

19:03.890 --> 19:08.030
When did Prof. Cha have such a deep knowledge of the qualifications of a doctor?

19:08.030 --> 19:09.990
If that's the case, then send him to another professor.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.030
I don't like that one.

19:12.030 --> 19:14.530
He doesn't know enough, does he?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.830
You're here, Vice President of Administration.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.340
Since you're related, you should know each other well.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.810
That's not the only thing he lacks.

19:22.810 --> 19:25.310
He is disagreeable and has got no propriety, manners, and humility.

19:25.310 --> 19:27.750
He has so many flaws.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.710
Please take care of him in the future, Professor Cha.

19:30.710 --> 19:35.520
The future of our consortium is in my hands. Think about that.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.160
Didn't I tell you?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.320
Dr. Go is the heir to our hospital.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.990
But President didn’t want to hand it over to him directly. So, he put forward a condition.

19:42.990 --> 19:45.560
It’s kind of a precondition of succession.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.040
It means

19:53.100 --> 19:57.270
that he gets here to take the certificate for inheriting the Group.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.380
How is it going?

20:03.380 --> 20:05.250
You are asking me?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.450
Why the question?

20:06.450 --> 20:07.820
I can’t stand that kind of guy

20:07.820 --> 20:11.360
walking around in front of me.

20:22.670 --> 20:25.170
It smells good.

20:33.810 --> 20:35.910
This is per…

20:38.320 --> 20:41.950
Who wears perfume in the hospital?

20:41.950 --> 20:44.260
How could I send them perfume and let them wear it in the hospital?

20:44.260 --> 20:47.420
I want them to get rid of the smell of disinfectant when dating after work.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.030
It’s the balance of work and life.

20:48.030 --> 20:49.790
Don’t you understand?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.130
You are done showing off your money.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.400
Time to work?

20:52.400 --> 20:55.130
Intern, Go Seung Tak.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.500
What?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.510
No ward inspection?

21:12.280 --> 21:13.720
This is a 65-year-old patient.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.120
She suffered from  HYPERLINK "http://www.baidu.com/link?url=QVPwitulcUUdUjL-QwKarF4tsq6QBpKA8F6jFONYzyGDnXE_v_XDoHS0Nb8oAXtsixCAe3_jnkz4FbPFACheI9VOUnbfxFf_jNXZtv5keJkcfvXZAAGO5KdRJxadzw_c" \t "_blank" bicuspid aortic valve

the day after the operation,

there has been no special problem.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.370
is a kind of congenital heart disease

21:34.370 --> 21:35.770
with an incidence rate of 1%.

21:35.770 --> 21:38.840
Symptoms vary with ways of aortic dilation.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.450
Young people may also suffer from AR.

21:41.450 --> 21:45.450
Based on aging, it may develop into AS or large artery dilation.

21:45.450 --> 21:48.920
He was famous at school.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.050
Famous for what?

21:50.050 --> 21:53.760
He had a wide range of knowledge like a professor.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.660
So what?

21:55.660 --> 21:58.060
He came first in any subject, in any test.

21:58.060 --> 22:00.260
No one knows where he read so many theses.

22:00.260 --> 22:04.170
At school, his tricky questions always got professors stumped.

22:04.170 --> 22:08.440
It was said professors started to learn more because of him.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.740
I heard that you took one-year off.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.740
Looks like that you worked hard.

22:11.740 --> 22:14.610
Go Seung Tak, you take charge of this patient afterward.

22:14.610 --> 22:16.610
What?

22:20.850 --> 22:21.950
Go Seung Tak.

22:21.950 --> 22:24.620
Tell us about Maze OP.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.090
Maze OP

22:30.090 --> 22:32.830
means an operation where arrhythmia transmission pathway which causes an abnormal heartbeat

22:32.830 --> 22:34.930
is changed into normal cardiac conduction

22:34.930 --> 22:38.040
with various of energy source.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.340
Good.

22:39.340 --> 22:41.870
This patient is also yours.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.980
Excuse me.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.850
This patient’s condition is unstable.

22:47.850 --> 22:48.480
I have to continue…

22:48.480 --> 22:49.710
Mr. An,

22:49.710 --> 22:53.320
does a doctor treat patients by sitting at his table?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.320
Leave it to him.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.300
Go Seung Tak.

23:05.300 --> 23:09.870
What medicine can be used during an infectious endocarditis attack?

23:11.900 --> 23:15.310
I don’t quite understand.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.310
Really?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.880
Vancomycin, gentamycin,

23:21.880 --> 23:24.150
ampicillin, aminoglycosides or ciprofloxacin.

23:24.150 --> 23:27.150
To choose a suitable antibiotic as appropriate will do.

23:27.150 --> 23:30.350
Do it this way after the discussion with Infection Dept.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.060
Me?

23:34.060 --> 23:35.090
Yeah.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.660
Didn’t Go Seung Tak say he doesn’t understand?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.140
Why always me?

23:45.140 --> 23:46.640
Because you are my bro.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.170
Sh*t!

23:49.170 --> 23:51.780
Don’t we check these patients over there?

24:01.520 --> 24:04.150
Hey! Those patients…

24:06.120 --> 24:07.860
Gim Jae Won.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.130
Why are these patients still here?

24:10.130 --> 24:11.230
Well…

24:11.230 --> 24:14.330
Their guardians refuse to transfer them.

24:14.330 --> 24:16.470
Our beds are enough?

24:16.470 --> 24:18.440
Ask them to transfer within this week.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.570
Get it.

24:20.570 --> 24:23.070
It turns out that giving up these patients

24:23.070 --> 24:26.680
is right and wise for a doctor.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.010
I learn a lot on my first day.

24:28.010 --> 24:30.010
It’s meaningful.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.990
Go Seung Tak.

24:38.990 --> 24:40.990
There are two categories of patients in the world.

24:40.990 --> 24:42.860
Patients who can survive after my treatment.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.000
Patients who can’t survive after my treatment.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.730
If my treatment doesn’t work,

24:46.730 --> 24:48.230
anyone else can’t help them.

24:48.230 --> 24:50.100
These patients fall into the second category.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.140
Didn’t you say I need to support the personnel?

24:52.140 --> 24:55.070
The more patients, the more earnings.

24:55.070 --> 24:56.370
Isn’t it the common sense?

24:56.370 --> 24:58.840
How could we put effort into those patients

24:58.840 --> 25:00.140
who have no hope for survival,

25:00.140 --> 25:01.980
but give up those who can survive?

25:01.980 --> 25:05.080
They don’t live a good life.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.320
I don’t understand why they don’t give up.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.890
When time is up, they should leave free and easy.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.890
Shouldn’t they?

25:20.060 --> 25:22.300
Bad luck!

25:27.170 --> 25:30.140
Right? Bad luck.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.380
It’s bad luck to be a doctor.

25:32.380 --> 25:35.280
Especially, that genius.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.480
People always say a genius is crazy.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.920
So, ignore what he said just now.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.560
Don’t take it seriously.

25:50.530 --> 25:51.900
Have you eaten yet?

25:51.900 --> 25:53.900
A little.

26:25.060 --> 26:26.130
What’s going on?

26:26.130 --> 26:27.430
First, to graduate from the medical university.

26:27.430 --> 26:28.900
Second, be an intern.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.830
Has your grandpa ever changed his idea?

26:30.830 --> 26:32.270
Alas, the President should be

26:32.270 --> 26:34.170
more cautious.

26:34.170 --> 26:35.040
How does an intern know

26:35.040 --> 26:37.870
such important information?

26:37.870 --> 26:40.940
He upgraded it. He asked me to take the certificate.

26:40.940 --> 26:43.550
Yeah, it must be a big blow for you, isn’t it?

26:43.550 --> 26:44.880
Or, it’s the destiny of an heir

26:44.880 --> 26:46.350
A kind of tough test.

26:46.350 --> 26:48.820
I just take it as field inspection.

26:48.820 --> 26:52.120
You actually choose the most tired department.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.790
Isn’t it cool? Heart.

26:53.790 --> 26:57.360
I don’t give my doctors any chance to look down upon me.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.270
Since you are here, why not try hard?

27:02.270 --> 27:03.970
Change.that attitude first.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.340
Su Jeong.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.510
I have been enjoying special treatment and privilege for 28 years.

27:08.510 --> 27:09.870
How to change my attitude now?

27:09.870 --> 27:12.580
People should indulge me.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.780
What’s more, I don’t think it’s necessary.

27:13.780 --> 27:15.550
I won’t be a doctor forever.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.220
Do I have a proper reason to work hard?

27:23.150 --> 27:25.190
Hello? Who’s speaking?

27:25.190 --> 27:26.720
Oh, specialist training.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.790
Operation?

27:27.790 --> 27:30.190
Why must I be there?

27:30.190 --> 27:32.130
If everything goes well, I want to go there, too.

27:32.130 --> 27:34.530
But I don’t feel…

27:35.570 --> 27:38.200
I haven’t finished.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.870
Professor Cha is going to have an operation.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.110
Why does he ask me there?

28:12.100 --> 28:13.840
Why are there so many people?

28:13.840 --> 28:15.210
Professor Cha, your operation

28:15.210 --> 28:17.110
is the best on-the-spot teaching, isn’t it?

28:17.110 --> 28:18.480
It’s a rare opportunity to watch.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.880
Moreover, they won't miss such a rare disease.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.080
Doctors have operations every day. What’s there to watch?

28:30.950 --> 28:33.560
You fool around on your first day at work.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.990
Put on your surgical gown and get back quickly.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.840
Stand behind me. Be closer.

28:48.970 --> 28:50.840
Let's get started.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.140
I guess that you have heard

28:52.140 --> 28:54.280
this is the fifth operation of this patient.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.310
Adhesion must be very serious.

28:55.310 --> 28:58.480
We must be careful when opening the chest.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.720
Here we go.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
Scalpel.

29:12.660 --> 29:13.260
Aspirator.

29:13.260 --> 29:15.670
Aspirator.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.270
Electrotome.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.350
Cutter.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.260
Electrotome.

29:48.470 --> 29:50.930
All right. Let’s change..

29:54.970 --> 29:56.910
Pressure clamp.

29:59.980 --> 30:01.750
Press down.

30:03.350 --> 30:05.520
Catch.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.920
Insert the tube.

30:14.590 --> 30:16.430
Cut.

30:16.030 --> 30:46.020
[Translated by iQIYI]

30:16.430 --> 30:18.860
Wire guider.

30:31.740 --> 30:34.180
Cut.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.150
Ok, good.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.960
Hello. This is Han Seung Won.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.930
Entertain our guests tonight, then.

30:50.930 --> 30:53.260
Don’t worry about it.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.430
Now the major operation is over.

30:54.430 --> 30:56.770
We should start esophageal ultrasound.

30:56.770 --> 31:00.670
No bleeding from the aortic valve.

31:00.670 --> 31:03.240
I mean, no after-suture bleeding.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.710
The average pressure difference is less than 1.5.

31:05.710 --> 31:07.040
No narrow blood vessels.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.050
The operation is very successful.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.090
Go Seung Tak.

31:16.090 --> 31:20.020
Explain bio prosthetic aortic valve.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.330
Bio prosthetic aortic valve

31:22.330 --> 31:25.660
is a kind of valve material,

31:25.660 --> 31:27.730
made of the cardiac membrane

31:27.730 --> 31:30.230
or implanted valve.

31:30.230 --> 31:32.600
But in the end it will get calcified.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.870
Then its side effects may cause problems.

31:34.870 --> 31:36.240
Okay, good.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.240
Very good.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.410
Now we should pull out the pipe.

31:43.410 --> 31:44.380
You tie the knot.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.380
Can you do that?

31:52.690 --> 31:54.820
Come on.

32:03.370 --> 32:04.730
Anyway,

32:04.730 --> 32:06.040
on the first day of anatomy practice,

32:06.040 --> 32:09.240
he was responsible for the abdominal incision of the body.

32:21.150 --> 32:22.490
What are you doing?

32:22.490 --> 32:26.160
Don’t you know how to do it?

32:26.160 --> 32:27.520
Hey, Go Seung Tak.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.630
I can’t do this.

32:29.630 --> 32:32.730
After that, he was often absent

32:32.730 --> 32:34.930
with various reasons.

32:34.930 --> 32:36.900
Go Seung Tak, are you…?

32:36.900 --> 32:38.900
Move.

33:00.890 --> 33:03.590
I admire you so much, professor.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.860
Do you know who are the slowest

33:07.860 --> 33:10.230
in improving spoken English?

33:10.230 --> 33:12.770
Those who get good grades at school.

33:12.770 --> 33:15.110
They think good performance in tests

33:15.110 --> 33:17.810
stands for good English.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.640
But what’s the use of 10-year good grades?

33:19.640 --> 33:21.810
You are a failure if you cannot speak English.

33:21.810 --> 33:23.450
It’s also true of medical skills.

33:23.450 --> 33:26.820
If you only focus on books and theories,

33:26.820 --> 33:30.420
you will become like this senior,

33:30.420 --> 33:34.390
who knows a lot but can’t use the scalpel.

33:34.390 --> 33:36.760
You may be born rich. So what?

33:36.760 --> 33:39.900
Your hands are unreliable.

33:39.900 --> 33:44.070
Why not just say his name?

33:44.070 --> 33:47.240
For a patient in a life-or-death situation,

33:47.240 --> 33:50.340
between a bad-tempered but highly skilled doctor

33:50.340 --> 33:54.440
and a cordial, kind but incompetent one,

33:54.440 --> 33:57.410
who do you think he will choose?

34:00.280 --> 34:03.350
To save patients requires

34:03.350 --> 34:06.620
not a kind heart

34:06.620 --> 34:08.460
but solid knowledge

34:08.460 --> 34:10.630
and manual dexterity.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.429
Keep that in mind.

34:12.429 --> 34:14.929
Doctors are not emotion suppliers.

34:14.929 --> 34:18.130
Doctors are professionals with visible skills.

34:18.130 --> 34:23.170
So, if you have no skills

34:23.170 --> 34:26.480
and only want good grades and tags,

34:31.179 --> 34:34.020
don’t waste your time here.

34:34.020 --> 34:36.020
Over.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.870
Your hands are unreliable hands.

34:54.870 --> 34:58.610
I have gold hands.

35:02.010 --> 35:05.750
I love gold hands.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.350
You know what?

35:07.350 --> 35:09.490
In other’s eyes,

35:09.490 --> 35:12.060
I’m a symbol of authority and admiration.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.460
But a strange intern came today.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.090
How dare he show off in front of me?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.530
He thinks he’s a prince?

35:20.530 --> 35:22.170
I’m speechless.

35:22.170 --> 35:23.930
Terrible hands.

35:24.570 --> 35:25.700
Cha Bun,

35:26.270 --> 35:27.970
tell me.

35:27.970 --> 35:30.210
Am I a person waiting to be tricked?

35:30.210 --> 35:31.270
Of course not.

35:31.270 --> 35:35.010
So, I took him to the operating room,

35:35.010 --> 35:38.180
and then mortified him hard.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.420
Boy, how dare you work against me?

35:41.420 --> 35:43.020
Your hands are so unreliable.

35:44.650 --> 35:47.360
It’s all right. I won,  anyway.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.630
That boy may not come to work tomorrow.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.300
If he comes,

35:56.800 --> 36:03.340
I’ll think of another strategy.

36:03.340 --> 36:05.940
So, I’m thinking that

36:05.940 --> 36:07.940
I can wear my new suit to work tomorrow.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.950
Or I can buy a new car

36:10.950 --> 36:13.320
after I pay the installment.

36:31.070 --> 36:33.500
Good morning, professor.

36:34.340 --> 36:36.710
You come?

36:36.710 --> 36:38.810
Of course, this is my workplace.

36:38.810 --> 36:41.080
You are tougher than I thought.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.610
That is the basic quality of an heir.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.250
Are we standing too close

36:51.250 --> 36:53.160
considering our social status?

36:53.160 --> 36:55.730
Only the old stubborn cares about it very much.

36:55.730 --> 36:57.760
Equality, justice and  fairness are the zeitgeist.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.660
Before learning the qualities of an heir,

36:58.660 --> 37:00.200
how about you having a doctor’s qualities first?

37:00.200 --> 37:01.300
For example, knot-tying.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.000
Even a genius needs to be cultivated well.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.070
I happen to be very talented in business.

37:05.070 --> 37:06.470
Then talk to your grandpa.

37:06.470 --> 37:07.340
Who knows?

37:07.340 --> 37:09.040
Maybe he’ll change his mind.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.810
He is a fickle man.

37:10.810 --> 37:13.210
I don’t need to take to him.

37:46.380 --> 37:47.380
You go up first.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.750
Why?

37:52.980 --> 37:54.220
Are you asking me questions?

37:54.220 --> 37:55.650
Do you think I’ll answer you?

37:55.650 --> 37:57.120
Are we very close?

38:01.290 --> 38:03.390
But he has asked me so many.

38:03.390 --> 38:04.890
Are you very close?

38:04.890 --> 38:06.460
You scared me.

38:06.460 --> 38:09.430
I get it. No discord, no concord.

38:09.430 --> 38:11.300
Enemies become friends.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.900
Maybe I’m the only victim.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.840
Why do you think so?

38:14.840 --> 38:16.240
Shall I buy you coffee?

38:16.240 --> 38:18.510
I must be a bad guy in my previous life.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.440
Hello.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.810
A cup of coffee.

38:21.810 --> 38:23.650
He will go to that place again.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.320
Where? What place?

38:26.320 --> 38:27.080
There is a place

38:27.080 --> 38:29.990
to drink coffee alone and look handsome.

38:30.550 --> 38:31.990
Thank you.

38:34.690 --> 38:35.990
In my hospital,

38:35.990 --> 38:38.490
is there any place I don’t know?

38:40.100 --> 38:41.330
Hey, you are asking for trouble.

38:41.330 --> 38:43.570
Don’t go there. He won’t like it.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.510
How are you doing?

39:57.340 --> 39:59.010
It’s been long.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.320
Great, you look good.

40:10.090 --> 40:12.790
It seems that you’ve also been drinking coffee here recently.

40:27.740 --> 40:29.810
Hello, this is Cha Yeong Min.

40:30.570 --> 40:33.880
I went out for coffee but came across an unexpected guest.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.810
No, I’m coming now.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.980
Because now I don’t want coffee at all.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.820
We’ve seen it at yesterday’s conference.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.920
Well, the patient with cardiac sarcoma.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.330
I didn’t tell you that

41:22.330 --> 41:25.860
it was President Jang Gwang Deok of Tianming Group

41:25.860 --> 41:28.400
who was hospitalized here in secret yesterday.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.400
As you know, President Jang is a public figure,

41:30.400 --> 41:32.600
so, he was sent here in secret.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.440
I hope you can understand, Professor Cha.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.510
I’ve told you my suggestion yesterday.

41:36.510 --> 41:38.140
Yeah, you did.

41:38.140 --> 41:41.310
But his son wants a surgery to be done.

41:50.050 --> 41:54.260
Now that you know it today, please reconsider your treatment plan.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.890
And be careful.

42:00.160 --> 42:04.630
I’m my father’s only son.

42:04.630 --> 42:08.040
I can’t let him go without even trying.

42:08.840 --> 42:15.510
Professor Cha, you are the best thoracic surgeon. I’m seriously asking you a favor.

42:15.510 --> 42:20.020
Your father is an elderly patient with diabetes, hypertension and a history of stroke.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.180
He can’t make it through the surgery.

42:22.180 --> 42:23.990
Even if he does make it,

42:23.990 --> 42:26.720
it’s hard to totally excise the tumors

42:26.720 --> 42:28.520
deep in his left atrium and pulmonary vein.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.760
As a result, he will have a relapse in three months.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.300
It’s difficult for him to live long.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.830
But he won’t live long either

42:33.830 --> 42:36.200
even without surgery, right?

42:38.430 --> 42:41.440
Please, let me fulfill my filial piety as a son.

42:44.570 --> 42:46.980

Get out of my sight forever.

What?

43:17.710 --> 43:19.410
Didn’t people say that his foundation is weak

43:19.410 --> 43:21.210
because of a short period of internship?

43:21.210 --> 43:23.680

Any complaints?

1:01:13.550 --> 1:01:16.380
Do you know how to read it?

1:01:17.390 --> 1:01:18.750
You…

1:01:18.750 --> 1:01:21.020
know that.

1:01:26.130 --> 1:01:26.830
Go Seung Tak.

1:01:26.830 --> 1:01:29.160
You see the hematocele.

1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:31.100
It's a cardiac tamponade on the right side of the ventricle.

1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:32.300
A surgery is needed to plug it up.

1:01:32.300 --> 1:01:33.170
Right here.

1:01:33.170 --> 1:01:34.740
Here.

1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:36.970
There's a hematocele in the heart.

1:01:36.970 --> 1:01:38.470
It looks like a cardiac tamponade.

1:01:38.470 --> 1:01:40.280
We're gonna do surgery to find the rupture and plug it.

1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:43.550
What are you guys doing? Get to the operating room.

1:01:43.550 --> 1:01:44.980
O Su Jeong, go straight to the operating room.

1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:46.410
Yeah, to the operating room.

1:01:46.450 --> 1:01:48.150
Find someone who can do the surgery.

1:01:48.150 --> 1:01:50.850
Hurry up.

1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:55.860
What the hell are they doing? Why aren't they here?

1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:57.030
90/110

1:01:57.030 --> 1:01:59.960
Yeah, it's fine.

1:02:04.770 --> 1:02:06.230
Hold on, Cha Yeong Min.

1:02:06.230 --> 1:02:09.540
You'll make it.

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:14.740
Answer the phone.

1:02:14.740 --> 1:02:18.050
I'm going crazy.

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.850
His blood pressure is falling.

1:02:22.850 --> 1:02:25.620
He will die if it goes on like this.

1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:28.360
Why is there no one here.

1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:37.170
Please, help me.

1:02:38.330 --> 1:02:40.100
Please.

1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:42.670
Please.

1:02:46.010 --> 1:02:48.410
Till now.

1:02:48.410 --> 1:02:51.650
How many lives I've saved.

1:02:51.650 --> 1:02:57.120
Does it make sense that no one in the operating room can save me!

1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:00.690
There are so many doctors in the hospital. Why this rookie!

1:03:00.690 --> 1:03:04.130
Call the emergency room.

1:03:05.730 --> 1:03:07.130
Hand me the scalpel.

1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:10.930
What are you doing?

1:03:10.930 --> 1:03:12.070
You wouldn't...

1:03:12.070 --> 1:03:13.230
Just give me the scalpel.

1:03:13.230 --> 1:03:14.600
Is it your first surgery?

1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:16.940
What do you want to do?

1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:18.440
Didn't you just say he was going to die?

1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:21.440
Are we just gonna let him die?

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.110
Go Seung Tak.

1:03:23.110 --> 1:03:25.750
There's no time. Give it to me.

1:03:36.490 --> 1:03:38.730
I can't take responsibility for that.

1:03:38.730 --> 1:03:40.600
What are you talking about?

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:42.930
Dr. O, you have to stop him.

1:03:42.930 --> 1:03:44.600
He knows the theory, but he is afraid to put it into practice.

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:47.600
You're putting my life in the hands of a boy like this.

1:03:50.810 --> 1:03:52.170
His blood pressure went down again.

1:03:52.170 --> 1:03:53.310
If we wait any longer...

1:03:53.310 --> 1:03:55.310
Wait.

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:04.720
Okay. I know you're trying to do something to save me.

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:05.950
That nice.

1:04:05.950 --> 1:04:08.620
But have you ever used a scalpel?

1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:11.960
I know there's no other way right now.

1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:14.030
Calm down.

1:04:14.030 --> 1:04:16.260
Just calm down and take a deep breath.

1:04:16.260 --> 1:04:20.340
Inhale, exhale, inhale and exhale.

1:04:20.340 --> 1:04:22.270
I've been through this before.

1:04:22.270 --> 1:04:23.040
I know you're scared.

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:25.740
You've never done it before. Of course, you're scared.

1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:26.440
But you know…

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.080
When I was an intern…

1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:30.010
You can do it anyway.

1:04:30.010 --> 1:04:31.510
Not everyone can do it, though.

1:04:31.510 --> 1:04:32.580
Anyway, I mean…

1:04:32.580 --> 1:04:34.150
You have to believe you can do it.

1:04:34.150 --> 1:04:37.450
Think about the procedure in your head.

1:04:37.450 --> 1:04:38.990
Your theory is professorial.

1:04:38.990 --> 1:04:41.820
Not that one, brat.

1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:44.890
Do you have a problem with me?

1:04:44.890 --> 1:04:46.790
Probably.

1:04:46.790 --> 1:04:49.260
But not now.

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:50.500
Save me first.

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:52.270
You can't do that here.

1:04:52.270 --> 1:04:55.340
I told you it wasn't there.

1:05:13.990 --> 1:05:16.160
Dr. Go, what are you doing?

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:18.860
Do you do it or not?

1:05:29.540 --> 1:05:31.410
What's going on?

1:05:31.410 --> 1:05:32.840
How is that possible?

1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:34.980
Ah…

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:38.950
Go Seung Tak.

1:06:05.910 --> 1:06:07.810
Let's start.

1:06:07.810 --> 1:06:11.010
O Su Jeong, come and be my assistant.

1:06:12.150 --> 1:06:13.680
Hurry up!

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:16.220
Come on!

1:06:24.590 --> 1:06:26.660
Drill!

1:06:29.930 --> 1:06:31.800
Electric saw!

1:06:33.940 --> 1:06:36.300
Open device!

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.170
My…

1:07:03.870 --> 1:07:06.030
My heart.

1:07:39.970 --> 1:07:42.640
-=Preview of the next episode=-

1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:44.370
Now, my hidden genius powers have been revealed.

1:07:44.370 --> 1:07:46.070
I can't even be loaf on the job anymore.

1:07:46.070 --> 1:07:49.080
Doesn't he know what's happening to him?

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:50.080
Come with me.

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:51.910
Come one. Go Seung Tak.

1:07:51.910 --> 1:07:53.310
Nurse Jeong, be careful!

1:07:53.310 --> 1:07:55.050
Can you be serious?

1:07:55.050 --> 1:07:57.490
Comatose ghosts can't possess.

1:07:57.490 --> 1:07:59.490
But you can...

1:07:59.490 --> 1:08:00.760
Dr. An, where the hell have you been?

1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:01.590
What?

1:08:01.590 --> 1:08:03.060
My surgery was perfect.

1:08:03.060 --> 1:08:05.630
I bet you swore before you joined thoracic surgery.

1:08:05.630 --> 1:08:07.400
You held the scalpel in the operating room that day.

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:11.070
So, you weren't trying to save me, and you were trying to kill me.
