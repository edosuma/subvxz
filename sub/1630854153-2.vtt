WOMAN: When I first
started here,

00:36.935 --> 00:38.835
we used to send skin
to Melbourne to grow.

00:38.935 --> 00:40.875
21 days it took.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.555
Patients don't have 21 days.

00:43.655 --> 00:46.315
So Marie Stoner and I started
working on the cell regrowths

00:46.415 --> 00:50.354
till we got it down to 10 days,
then five, then three.

-Skin cells.

00:56.574 --> 00:58.034
They're mine, actually.

-Fiona, this won't work.
-Oh, we know it works.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.953
We spray it on,
we get perfect coverage

01:03.053 --> 01:06.073
around corners and folds,
hardly any scarring.

01:06.173 --> 01:07.673
It'll never replace
skin grafts.

01:07.773 --> 01:09.433
It might in many cases.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.553
Look, just think of it,
we won't have to damage

01:11.653 --> 01:14.912
an uninjured part of a patient's
body to treat their burns.

01:15.012 --> 01:17.672

Can I just say, on behalf of
all the Australian people,

11:40.601 --> 11:43.781

-No, that was hours ago.
-Maybe she's in post-op.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.698
-Ask the surgeon.
-I'll get them ready for evac.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.778
I'll number the serious patients
1 to 5. Ones go out first, OK?
