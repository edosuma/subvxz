WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:02.535
<i>Life's great.</i>

00:02.617 --> 00:05.642
<i>With the janitor fired,
I can walk the halls without fear.</i>

00:06.175 --> 00:08.211
<i>I don't even hesitate
around corners any more.</i>

00:10.289 --> 00:11.530
<i>But maybe I should.</i>

00:11.803 --> 00:13.703
I-can-feel-a-little-JD-five?

00:14.102 --> 00:15.056
No thanks, Todd.

00:15.084 --> 00:16.929
But I can and I want my five.

00:18.774 --> 00:21.568
<i>Plus, Elliot and I were better
friends than we've been in a long time.</i>

00:21.790 --> 00:22.977
<i>We were going to movies.</i>

00:23.059 --> 00:25.974
- I really liked that.
- Oprah produced it.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.021
<i>We were going out to dinner.</i>

00:28.139 --> 00:29.784
My salmon was great.

00:29.879 --> 00:32.040
You know, Oprah owns that restaurant.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.618
<i>And on weekends, when I had Sam,
she even came over for breakfasts.</i>

00:36.158 --> 00:38.998
I could make pancakes,
or we could have...

00:39.223 --> 00:40.357
Oprah O's!

00:40.918 --> 00:41.970
And check this out.

00:43.063 --> 00:44.758
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

00:45.472 --> 00:46.616
That's funny.

00:47.382 --> 00:48.106
That's it?

00:48.266 --> 00:49.917
Not only did I rig this box,
but I got...

00:50.015 --> 00:52.225
Whitney in payroll
to tape her Oprah voice.

00:52.534 --> 00:54.557
I've been working on this joke
for over a week,

00:54.885 --> 00:56.811
and all you can muster
is a little chuckle?

00:58.187 --> 00:59.745
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

00:59.981 --> 01:00.510
Stop!

01:00.524 --> 01:02.109
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

01:02.287 --> 01:02.998
Broken.

01:03.162 --> 01:04.337
<i>Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>

01:04.337 --> 01:05.280
Stop it!

01:05.587 --> 01:07.453
<i>- Who wants to eat some cereal?</i>
- Stop, stupid box!

01:13.123 --> 01:15.353
OK. So, I'm going
to add a little pressure now, sir.

01:17.728 --> 01:19.720
It's allright, it's perfectly natural.

01:20.462 --> 01:21.419
That was you.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.842
Yeah, I know.
But it's still perfectly natural.

01:25.225 --> 01:26.100
Lovely.

01:27.563 --> 01:28.602
It's your own fault.

01:28.665 --> 01:30.750
You're the only attending who sticks
around for an entire exam

01:30.797 --> 01:32.600
when he calls for a surgical consult.

01:32.811 --> 01:33.563
Why is that?

01:33.631 --> 01:34.330
No reason.

01:34.463 --> 01:36.822
Oh! So you don't want to say.
That's cool.

01:36.982 --> 01:38.603
I know you know hate
that I call Carla "baby" all the time,

01:38.666 --> 01:40.837
so I'll just call you "baby"
until you tell me.

01:40.877 --> 01:42.416
- Does that sound good, baby?
- Don't do that.

01:42.472 --> 01:43.683
Oh, what's the matter, baby?

01:43.713 --> 01:46.357
Look, surgeons always want
to slice people open

01:46.435 --> 01:47.709
whether it's the best option or not.

01:47.717 --> 01:49.767
No disrespect,
but you're just not that bright.

01:49.836 --> 01:52.269
You have no idea
how to do anything else.

01:52.301 --> 01:55.426
Unfortunately, sick people are also
very very stupid

01:55.427 --> 01:57.445
and will almost always
agree to anything

01:57.519 --> 02:00.307
that a blood-letting corpse carpenter
such as yourself tells them.

02:00.404 --> 02:03.055
I simply stay in the room to make sure
they make the right choice.

02:03.734 --> 02:04.830
So you don't trust me?

02:04.960 --> 02:05.880
Uh, that's right.

02:06.153 --> 02:07.438
That is an easier way to say it.

02:08.045 --> 02:08.791
Baby!

02:09.851 --> 02:10.458
Baby!

02:11.087 --> 02:12.919
There he is, right on schedule.

02:13.288 --> 02:15.121
<i>Maybe it was
the free muffins for life,</i>

02:15.122 --> 02:17.752
<i>but Dr Kelso
still hangs out here every day.</i>

02:18.102 --> 02:19.017
Morning, everybody!

02:19.373 --> 02:20.686
Morning, Bob!

02:20.917 --> 02:22.339
I'm like Norm in this bitch.

02:22.516 --> 02:24.840
<i>Ted finally said
what we were all thinking.</i>

02:24.949 --> 02:29.593
Why are you spending your retirement
hanging around the place you use to work?

02:30.416 --> 02:31.701
It's so sad.

02:32.534 --> 02:36.160
By comparison,
it almost makes my life seem...

02:37.400 --> 02:38.206
No.

02:38.986 --> 02:40.065
Still sad.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.323
Yeah.

02:41.487 --> 02:44.323
Seriously, don't you have
anything better to do?

02:47.865 --> 02:50.517
Come on, people.

02:50.618 --> 02:53.195
I've got tons of stuff going on.

02:53.231 --> 02:55.424
I golf,
I play gin with the boys.

02:55.519 --> 02:59.041
In fact, I am just here
to stock up on muffins.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.556
Donnie, four roadies please.

03:03.656 --> 03:08.449
Today, Enid and I are leaving to go
spend a weekend in wine country.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.491
Of course, you know how Enid complains.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.962
Any place I take her is "whine" country.

03:15.647 --> 03:18.184
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

03:18.066 --> 03:20.006
Anyway, keep my table warm.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.086
Adios.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.257
What are you doing?

03:24.353 --> 03:27.153
That's the sound I hear in my head
whenever people leave.

03:28.767 --> 03:29.574
Whatever.

03:29.983 --> 03:31.555
I will see you after work.

03:37.595 --> 03:39.733
You should really hesitate before
going around corners.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.768
I was thinking that earlier.

03:41.836 --> 03:45.021
Hey, since that Chief Doctor person
that fired me is gone, I'm back!

03:47.891 --> 03:48.711
Yay!

03:48.834 --> 03:50.378
I knew you'd react that way.

03:50.474 --> 03:53.350
And since Jimmy, the overly touching
orderly, got his job back too,

03:53.562 --> 03:55.845
I took the liberty of telling him
how much you missed him.

03:57.662 --> 03:58.700
I missed you too.

03:58.974 --> 04:00.286
- What's new ?
- Nothing, man.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.518
You seem a little clinched.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.514
Found a treasure-trove.

04:03.869 --> 04:04.812
Where's the gold?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.507
Take my little pickaxe,
and get to it.

04:06.555 --> 04:08.999
- OK, don't. No, no, no.
- Wiggle worm...

04:09.281 --> 04:11.656
- ...This is wiggle worm.
- I'll get my own gold, thank you.

04:11.776 --> 04:13.008
OK, welcome back.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.386
Why ?

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.193 --> 04:31.359
See you later, buddy.

04:31.441 --> 04:32.780
Hey. Have a good one, guys.

04:33.163 --> 04:34.024
No, wait.

04:34.243 --> 04:35.104
Something's wrong.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.017
What is it?

04:37.523 --> 04:38.650
It's Dr Cox.

04:38.891 --> 04:40.581
He's all up in my business and...

04:42.399 --> 04:43.301
Dr Cox!

04:43.964 --> 04:45.090
Hang in there, bear.

04:46.308 --> 04:47.705
How did you know
that he was hurting?

04:47.768 --> 04:49.411
Did you like...
hear it in his voice?

04:49.565 --> 04:51.662
With Turk, I can always
feel it from his soul,

04:51.709 --> 04:52.887
like a wave of heat.

04:53.950 --> 04:55.928
Are you going to make a joke
about how gay that sounds?

04:55.969 --> 04:57.536
Definitely.
I just don't have the words yet.

04:57.618 --> 04:58.880
Well, let me know.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.347
Hello, folks.
I'm Dr Christopher Turk.

05:05.882 --> 05:07.886
You're right so far.
Continue.

05:08.283 --> 05:10.909
Mr Halford, Dr Cox tells me
that you're in need of a new kidney.

05:10.983 --> 05:13.013
And I understand your wife
wants to be the donor.

05:13.220 --> 05:15.832
So, what do you say we run
some tests and see if she's a match?

05:15.967 --> 05:16.623
OK?

05:16.910 --> 05:19.577
Dr Cox said you are
the best surgeon here, so I'm fine.

05:20.089 --> 05:22.431
Right on.
See you guys later.

05:23.979 --> 05:26.219
I don't understand.
If I'm the best surgeon here,

05:26.288 --> 05:28.167
how come you're always
looking over my shoulder?

05:28.218 --> 05:29.500
Oh, give me a break, would you?

05:29.883 --> 05:31.828
Saying someone is
"the best surgeon"

05:31.863 --> 05:35.378
is like saying someone is the
smartest cast member of <i>The Hills</i>.

05:35.478 --> 05:36.168
Let's face it.

05:36.231 --> 05:39.928
It's just not that tough to float
to the top of the surgical toilet.

05:40.494 --> 05:42.582
Take your fellow-cutter,
The Todd.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.200
Now, he's also
deemed competent enough

05:45.260 --> 05:48.312
to perform a kidney transplant
on that gentleman right there.

05:48.339 --> 05:49.925
Yet... observe.

05:50.740 --> 05:53.503
Say, Todd?
What's for lunch today?

05:53.610 --> 05:54.776
I'm not sure, bro.

05:55.009 --> 05:58.628
This time, I'll just move my lips
as if I was speaking

05:58.663 --> 06:01.115
and his tiny surgeon brain
will tell him

06:01.296 --> 06:04.511
the glass is now just too darn thick
to hear through.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.485
Can't hear you
through the glass, dude!

06:13.628 --> 06:15.578
- Wow!
- Wow what?

06:23.792 --> 06:25.459
It's true, you're back!

06:26.607 --> 06:28.015
I'm so happy.

06:28.698 --> 06:29.915
You don't look happy.

06:29.956 --> 06:33.859
I don't smile a whole lot.
And lately when I try to, it hurts.

06:33.966 --> 06:35.920
But trust me. I'm happy.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.752
Return of the king, huh?

06:37.847 --> 06:38.708
Yeah.

06:39.206 --> 06:42.419
I can't tell you how much
I've missed having you around...

06:42.566 --> 06:44.936
Jimmy, I'm really not
comfortable with that.

06:44.985 --> 06:46.147
Jimmy, downstairs.

06:46.352 --> 06:47.678
No problem.
See you guys later.

06:50.294 --> 06:52.036
I'm gonna have to teach you
his command words.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.493
Awesome!

06:56.887 --> 06:58.700
I'm starving,
there's a Coffee Bucks up there.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.572
- Let's grab something.
- I got it.

07:00.846 --> 07:03.172
The only way that moment you had
with Turk could have been any gayer

07:03.274 --> 07:05.991
would be if you two went home
and actually made love afterwards.

07:09.504 --> 07:10.666
No. Elliot, stop!

07:11.322 --> 07:15.282
You know I automatically picture any
visual image someone puts in my head.

07:15.348 --> 07:17.591
You can't do that, it's embarassing.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.489
<i>But not as embarassing as this.</i>

07:20.831 --> 07:21.965
Dr Kelso?

07:22.767 --> 07:24.374
Aren't you supposed
to be on vacation?

07:24.498 --> 07:25.564
Crap.

07:27.127 --> 07:28.898
Thanks for tagging in for me, Teddy.

07:29.086 --> 07:30.717
I really need to ease myself back in.

07:30.813 --> 07:33.237
Mopping is not like riding a bike,
that's for sure.

07:33.791 --> 07:34.875
No problem.

07:35.786 --> 07:36.987
Hey, Dr Turk.

07:37.072 --> 07:38.834
Did you see who's back?

07:39.367 --> 07:41.392
- Hey.
- I know, right?

07:42.771 --> 07:43.919
Oh, that sucks.

07:44.247 --> 07:45.021
What?

07:45.075 --> 07:47.500
- It's my kidney transplant patient...
- I apologize.

07:47.553 --> 07:50.363
I said "What?" but I meant
"Move it along".

07:53.700 --> 07:57.382
By the way, what happened to the
janitor they hired to replace you?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.321
We're going to have
to let you go, Marv.

08:02.322 --> 08:03.983
But, stiff upper lip.

08:04.309 --> 08:07.493
- I'm sorry, Dr Itor.
- Call me Jan.

08:09.361 --> 08:10.522
I heard he quit.

08:13.324 --> 08:14.951
Mopping's hard.

08:15.033 --> 08:17.082
You're working against
yourself there. Go faster.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.995
I bet you can't wait
to call all your friends

08:23.050 --> 08:24.932
and tell them how pathetic I am.

08:25.424 --> 08:28.242
Actually, sir, we young people
are more into texting these days.

08:28.565 --> 08:29.584
JD, be sensitive.

08:29.663 --> 08:32.505
Don't act like you're at a ping pong
match between a ninja and Bigfoot.

08:33.361 --> 08:35.842
I know that made no sense, but
he's totally there now in his head.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.693
Look at his eyes.

08:40.864 --> 08:42.258
Look at that.

08:42.599 --> 08:44.171
He should be out for a while.

08:45.032 --> 08:47.914
I just have lot more
free time than I thought.

08:48.839 --> 08:51.805
Enid and I were going to travel
all over the country,

08:52.147 --> 08:54.183
but we don't have cash right now.

08:55.988 --> 08:57.327
Elliot, stop doing that!

08:57.630 --> 08:59.230
Who won the ping pong game?

08:59.380 --> 09:00.364
The sasquatch.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.079
Then Turk and I took him
to a carnival to celebrate.

09:03.394 --> 09:05.544
Man, that hairy bastard
loves funnel cake!

09:05.694 --> 09:06.514
Amazing.

09:07.403 --> 09:08.538
<i>Now it's time to split</i>

09:08.539 --> 09:11.813
<i>before he shares something so personal
that we're trapped here forever.</i>

09:12.155 --> 09:13.610
We should probably get going.

09:13.939 --> 09:15.350
Last thing I expected was

09:15.401 --> 09:18.708
to be an old man with no idea
what the hell to do with his life.

09:22.059 --> 09:24.418
Tom, I'm sorry but Darcy
was not a kidney match.

09:24.748 --> 09:26.696
So we need to get you
on the transplant list right away 

09:26.731 --> 09:28.292
so we can find a new donor.

09:28.396 --> 09:29.155
Wrong.

09:30.012 --> 09:31.533
You didn't even hear
what I told them.

09:31.616 --> 09:32.668
What did you tell them?

09:32.846 --> 09:34.524
- Well, I basically told...
- Wrong!

09:35.128 --> 09:36.304
Great news, folks.

09:36.413 --> 09:39.201
I had occasion to speak
with Dr Quinlan here.

09:42.619 --> 09:43.292
Anyway.

09:43.393 --> 09:46.340
Do you see his kidney patient,
Mr Brinkley?

09:47.034 --> 09:50.710
It turns out that his wife
is not a donor match for him, either.

09:50.970 --> 09:54.647
And in the coincidence of the day,
she is a match for you sir.

09:54.710 --> 09:57.226
And you, Mrs Halford,
are a match for him.

09:57.317 --> 10:00.972
We do the old switcheroo,
and everybody wins.

10:01.244 --> 10:03.257
So when would I get my new kidney?

10:03.434 --> 10:06.250
Mr Brinkley has been in dialysis
for quite some time,

10:06.318 --> 10:08.555
so Darcy, whe're going to have
to get him your kidney

10:08.607 --> 10:10.305
 just as soon as possible.
And Tom,

10:10.340 --> 10:12.706
we'll schedule your surgery
for next week.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.524
Look Dr Kelso,
leaving any job is tough.

10:17.991 --> 10:20.027
I-- I remember when my cousin
got fired from her job,

10:20.232 --> 10:22.646
she was so depressed because
it was the only salon in town,

10:22.674 --> 10:24.563
and all she ever wanted
to do was cut hair.

10:25.123 --> 10:26.235
Here it comes.

10:26.313 --> 10:30.249
<i>Both Dr Kelso and I had heard enough
of Elliot inspirational stories</i>

10:30.290 --> 10:33.105
to know that they invariably end
with someone killing himself.

10:33.228 --> 10:34.351
But, then she moved.

10:34.422 --> 10:35.779
<i>Uh. Maybe not.</i>

10:35.947 --> 10:37.442
To a better place.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.845
<i>Or maybe so.</i>

10:39.556 --> 10:41.482
Look, give yourself a little time.

10:41.715 --> 10:44.052
You'll figure out how
to be happy, I promise.

10:45.234 --> 10:47.667
<i>I'm never ready for
half the stuff that people say.</i>

10:47.799 --> 10:49.861
<i>Whether it's an answer
you didn't expect.</i>

10:49.917 --> 10:51.771
So how did you get hired back?

10:51.948 --> 10:52.931
I didn't.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.047
Technicly, I don't work here.

10:57.296 --> 10:59.146
<i>A shocker from a patient.</i>

10:59.797 --> 11:01.496
We've been talking, and...

11:01.497 --> 11:03.736
We don't want to trade
kidneys with the Brinkleys.

11:03.938 --> 11:05.658
We'll go on the transplant list.

11:07.695 --> 11:08.761
<i>Or this.</i>

11:09.027 --> 11:09.875
Thanks.

11:10.393 --> 11:13.162
I really appreciate you two
trying to cheer me up.

11:13.244 --> 11:14.995
<i>Actually, that wasn't unexpected.</i>

11:15.144 --> 11:16.456
<i>But, this was.</i>

11:16.602 --> 11:19.298
Well, it's nice to see
you two dating again.

11:23.579 --> 11:25.455
<i>It was time
to demand an explanation.</i>

11:25.539 --> 11:27.089
Why would you think we're dating?

11:27.601 --> 11:29.356
Why won't they do the kidney switch?

11:30.757 --> 11:33.771
If you weren't hired back,
why are you here working?

11:33.941 --> 11:35.806
I'm not. You are.

11:39.312 --> 11:40.825
JD and I are just friends, Dr Kelso.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.702
I mean, we just like
hanging out together.

11:43.028 --> 11:45.052
We rent movies, go on hikes.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.901
On Sunday nights,
we do our laundry together.

11:47.149 --> 11:48.933
Did you know that Elliot's
granny panties

11:49.004 --> 11:50.899
are actually her granny's panties.

11:50.921 --> 11:53.491
It's just one pair, JD,
excuse me for being sentimental.

11:53.605 --> 11:58.460
So, basically, you two do everything
a normal couple does except to have sex.

11:58.860 --> 11:59.707
Exactly.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.363
Sounds awesome.

12:01.826 --> 12:05.523
Pardon me, I had nine coffees
in two hours. Time to drain.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.010
Oh! It's a new shirt!

12:10.406 --> 12:12.451
Hey, do you ever still
think of me in that way?

12:12.730 --> 12:13.467
What way?

12:14.369 --> 12:18.011
You know.
In a sexual way.

12:24.792 --> 12:25.667
Sometimes.

12:26.473 --> 12:28.469
Do you ever...
think of me that way?

12:32.186 --> 12:33.146
Sometimes.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.347
Put your shirt back on.

12:35.439 --> 12:38.123
I'm just flipping it
so you can't see the stain.

12:39.189 --> 12:40.488
<i>And then I finally said it.</i>

12:41.157 --> 12:45.237
Do you think maybe
we should talk about... us?

12:46.043 --> 12:47.451
Maybe we should.

12:47.731 --> 12:51.267
<i>And just like that, it was as if
we were off in our own little world.</i>

12:53.072 --> 12:54.534
My guy needs a kidney now.

12:54.871 --> 12:56.667
Why wouldn't the Halfords say yes?

12:56.831 --> 12:58.036
Because they're in no rush.

12:58.084 --> 12:59.987
Plus, the Halfords
don't know the Brinkleys.

13:00.095 --> 13:01.555
So they don't trust them.

13:01.586 --> 13:02.643
We're screwed.

13:02.859 --> 13:03.787
Awesome.

13:04.539 --> 13:07.886
In The Todd's world, if anybody
gets screwed, it's a good thing.

13:08.386 --> 13:09.685
Of course it is.

13:12.176 --> 13:14.071
Look, I'm here because I want to be here.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.949
But don't worry.
I'm going to get my job back.

13:15.989 --> 13:16.859
Oh, good!

13:17.009 --> 13:18.155
What's your plan?

13:18.378 --> 13:19.278
I just told it to you.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.982
I'm here, therefore
I will get my job back.

13:22.017 --> 13:23.747
You're making my head hurt.

13:23.884 --> 13:25.140
We both know that's not me.

13:25.190 --> 13:27.745
That's from when you were a baby,
and a marble fountain fell on you.

13:27.796 --> 13:30.579
Sometimes, my mom
kept my crib in the driveway.

13:30.723 --> 13:31.499
Mine too.

13:31.802 --> 13:34.632
But I live my live
by a very specific credo.

13:35.069 --> 13:36.641
Everything works out for me.

13:36.928 --> 13:39.197
There is no way this works out for us.

13:39.306 --> 13:41.043
The Halfords are stubborn people.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.331
I got an idea.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.297
<i>If the Halfords don't trust the
Brinkleys to come through for them,</i>

13:47.391 --> 13:49.320
<i>we can just do
the surgery simultaneously</i>

13:49.373 --> 13:51.017
<i>and take trust out as an issue.</i>

13:52.157 --> 13:53.682
That guy is such a jerk.

13:54.221 --> 13:56.354
Don't worry,
he can't hear me through the glass.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.722
You want me to go first?

14:03.252 --> 14:06.528
Elliot, I've never been able
to get over the idea of us.

14:07.897 --> 14:09.473
I'm still crazy about you.

14:09.556 --> 14:11.787
I don't really know
what you want me to say.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.455
Maybe you could tell me
if you feel the same way?

14:14.575 --> 14:15.402
Yeah!

14:15.522 --> 14:18.020
Maybe you could say it
without sounding angry.

14:18.199 --> 14:19.537
But, JD, you crushed me.

14:19.620 --> 14:22.137
I mean, I gave you my love,
and you threw it back at my face,

14:22.190 --> 14:24.469
and pretty much scarred
me romanticly.

14:24.552 --> 14:27.515
I mean, now I'm doomed to a life
of gravitating to safe boring guys

14:27.598 --> 14:28.858
that I don't really love.

14:28.941 --> 14:31.716
And I'm repelled by
the ones I care for deeply.

14:32.257 --> 14:33.642
So, thank you... for that.

14:33.762 --> 14:35.653
Look, if it helps,
you hurt me too.

14:35.773 --> 14:36.801
Really?

14:36.884 --> 14:39.335
There were so many times
I wanted to be with you so badly

14:39.418 --> 14:40.883
and you shut me down.

14:41.003 --> 14:43.538
Like when we first met, huh...

14:43.573 --> 14:45.575
When you wanted to be sex buddies.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.161
Oh yeah, but that's when
I felt work so overwhelming,

14:51.202 --> 14:53.431
- And I...
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

14:54.347 --> 14:57.996
I'm sorry, we've just been down
this road so many times, you know?

14:58.918 --> 15:02.665
Seriously, does even talking about it just
make you hate yourself a little bit?

15:03.213 --> 15:05.656
I can't tell from just doing
the normal amount of hating myself,

15:05.706 --> 15:08.926
or if I'm at a slightly
higher level of self-loathing.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.581
You're too hard on yourself.

15:10.664 --> 15:11.464
No, I'm not.

15:11.505 --> 15:13.532
I'm just stupid and ugly,
and I have a pig face.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.811
JD, we're just back here again
because we're both lonely

15:17.864 --> 15:20.609
and neither one of us have had
any physical contact for months.

15:20.692 --> 15:22.336
I've had physical contacts.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.562
With who?

15:24.208 --> 15:27.377
All the energies are in you,
I'm just opening the channel.

15:28.573 --> 15:30.595
Here it is.
Here it is.

15:31.262 --> 15:32.950
I'd rather not talk about it.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.039
Looks like everybody got
through with flying colors.

15:36.159 --> 15:37.885
Congratulations there, Gandhi.

15:37.968 --> 15:41.423
Your ability to bring people together
is very powerful, much like...

15:42.540 --> 15:43.420
Gandhi.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.172
That means a lot to me.

15:45.292 --> 15:48.368
Because I'm just so
desperate for your approval.

15:50.552 --> 15:52.682
What-- What's his problem?

15:53.230 --> 15:54.613
Is he still mad at me?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.170
Maybe.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.025
I can't be sure.

15:59.331 --> 16:02.489
The Brinkleys never gave the
Halfords a reason to be skeptical.

16:02.609 --> 16:05.289
Life would be so much easier
if everybody just trusted each other.

16:12.385 --> 16:13.856
We have so much history.

16:14.197 --> 16:16.434
- Most of it bad.
- Yeah.

16:16.554 --> 16:18.383
How can we ever get past that?

16:18.466 --> 16:21.245
- We can't.
- Oh, good. That makes me feel better.

16:21.859 --> 16:25.264
But maybe, we could remember
all our pit falls like a road map.

16:25.347 --> 16:27.777
Maybe, this time, we could
avoid all the drama.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.551
We don't have
to be that couple where...

16:29.638 --> 16:31.422
one of us says
they're moving out of town,

16:31.480 --> 16:33.914
the other one have to rush
to the airport to stop them.

16:34.058 --> 16:37.431
We don't have to argue about
whether or not we want to break.

16:37.514 --> 16:39.842
You watched the <i>Friends</i>
marathon last night, didn't you?

16:39.925 --> 16:41.435
I did. I loved it.

16:41.776 --> 16:45.801
The point is, Elliot, you're a lot
stronger than you used to be.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.704
And I've changed too.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.591
I have a beard now.

16:50.674 --> 16:53.312
Do you still let that inner voice
of yours control you?

16:53.395 --> 16:56.940
<i>This is getting too serious.
Kick her. Kick her in the head.</i>

16:57.088 --> 16:58.261
Not as much.

16:59.630 --> 17:02.030
Paycheck time, everyone!

17:02.603 --> 17:05.016
Come on, Whitney.
I like it when you do it like Oprah.

17:05.251 --> 17:06.271
Fine.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.714
<i>Who wants to get a paycheck?</i>

17:08.938 --> 17:10.896
<i>You got a paycheck,
you got a paycheck.</i>

17:10.932 --> 17:12.588
<i>You got a paycheck!</i>

17:12.968 --> 17:14.598
You got to go, man!

17:14.881 --> 17:17.097
Everybody's going to see when
she doesn't have a check for you.

17:17.156 --> 17:18.346
It'll be humiliating.

17:18.665 --> 17:23.238
Look, you can't just say things are
going to work out, and then they do.

17:23.358 --> 17:26.205
- That's not how the world...
- Excuse me.

17:26.289 --> 17:27.599
I didn't get mine.

17:27.683 --> 17:28.819
Who are you?

17:28.939 --> 17:30.999
I'm the janitor. See?

17:31.355 --> 17:34.752
Actually, I'm the old janitor.
I replaced the janitor that replaced me.

17:34.793 --> 17:36.690
So, I'm still in the system.

17:36.773 --> 17:38.480
I'll go get you a check.

17:38.732 --> 17:41.092
Didn't mean to cut you off, Ted.
You were saying?

17:44.173 --> 17:47.266
Mop it off.
Mop it off.

17:49.220 --> 17:51.592
Mrs Winter, this is Dr Turk.

17:52.243 --> 17:55.989
He's going to give you an exam and
explain all your surgical options to you.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.020
One second. Hey!

17:58.971 --> 17:59.981
You're leaving ?

18:00.209 --> 18:03.491
Please, don't make me have second
thoughts by asking very stupid questions.

18:03.574 --> 18:05.329
So what, you trust surgeons now?

18:05.412 --> 18:07.903
No, I trust you.

18:11.614 --> 18:12.717
I know we're talking,

18:12.768 --> 18:14.956
but it still feels like
we're being so careful, you know?

18:15.571 --> 18:16.801
We're just scared.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.534
I made so many mistakes in my life
because I was scared.

18:22.022 --> 18:24.786
It's the reason I bailed
when you said "I love you".

18:24.906 --> 18:27.146
- It's the reason...
- Blah blah blah blah blah.

18:27.768 --> 18:28.680
OK.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.895
But I am scared of
ending our friendship.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.586
What if I get hurt again?

18:34.669 --> 18:38.091
- What if you pick up a new STD?
- For the last time, that was not an STD!

18:38.178 --> 18:39.446
It was a urinary tract infection,

18:39.447 --> 18:41.281
and I got it from
having sex with you in a pond.

18:41.958 --> 18:43.449
<i>Yeah you did!</i>

18:43.932 --> 18:46.051
I tell what else
I don't want to deal with.

18:46.134 --> 18:48.360
All the judgements
from everyone else.

18:48.443 --> 18:51.148
Dr Cox, Jordan.
Even Turk and Carla.

18:51.376 --> 18:53.888
I mean, it's almost enough of
a reason not to do anything.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.660
Hogwash!

18:56.419 --> 18:57.488
Excuse me?

18:57.822 --> 19:00.828
That ridiculous
drivel you just said.

19:01.816 --> 19:03.718
But who am I to talk?

19:04.753 --> 19:09.525
Here I am, eating some kind of a
banana nut sawdust muffin,

19:09.605 --> 19:12.835
and hiding out in this crappy excuse
for a Coffee Bucks.

19:14.568 --> 19:17.398
Who the hell cares
what anybody else thinks?

19:21.186 --> 19:25.272
Just look into your heart, and
do whatever the hell makes you happy.

19:32.995 --> 19:34.989
That's right, Ted. I'm back.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.442
I love it here.

19:36.861 --> 19:37.800
Donnie!

19:39.485 --> 19:40.982
Moist.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.559
<i>Elliot and I were tempted
to take Dr Kelso's advice.</i>

19:44.642 --> 19:46.646
<i>Because often when you do it,
it makes you happy.</i>

19:46.701 --> 19:48.560
<i>Things have a way of working out.</i>

19:49.243 --> 19:51.772
Actually, I normally
get paid twice this.

19:52.243 --> 19:54.480
My mistake.
I'll be right back.

19:55.177 --> 19:58.461
<i>But it also occurred to us that
you can have the best intentions,</i>

20:00.361 --> 20:02.721
<i>you still fall back into old habits.</i>

20:03.596 --> 20:04.985
Shhh. Get out of here.

20:09.663 --> 20:13.255
<i>So I guess, the real answer is
that there is no easy answer.</i>

20:13.560 --> 20:16.320
<i>You just have to go for it, or not.</i>

20:20.523 --> 20:22.320
This seems like a good idea.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.194
Who cares?

20:39.918 --> 20:42.216
I'm just going to need
to engage my legs.

20:42.816 --> 20:45.671
Alright.
This is just to brace you.

20:45.991 --> 20:47.501
You're a wizzard.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.544
We're just gonna work this out.

20:49.627 --> 20:51.211
- Let it flaw out.
