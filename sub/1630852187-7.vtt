WEBVTT

00:10.320 --> 00:11.640
Tokyo is back!

00:13.520 --> 00:14.960
Tokyo is back!

00:15.280 --> 00:17.000
On the ground!
Everyone on the ground!

00:17.200 --> 00:19.200
We have to open the door, dammit!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.440
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

00:22.520 --> 00:23.560
Attention, fire.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.080
Let's go!

00:37.440 --> 00:39.280
No! We have to cover her, dammit!

00:41.080 --> 00:43.120
Kidnapper in range, fire.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.840
Papa, look out!

00:47.920 --> 00:49.400
Take cover! Behind you!

02:20.800 --> 02:21.840
This is fucking crazy.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.600
What is?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.320
All of this, papa.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.400
It'll work out this time,
I'm telling you.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.480
This time?

02:31.880 --> 02:32.800
It has to work out.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.600
-We deserve it, right?
-Of course we do.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
Help, help!

02:47.520 --> 02:48.400
Please!

02:48.480 --> 02:49.480
The first aid kit!

02:49.840 --> 02:51.160
The fucking first aid kit!

02:51.240 --> 02:52.120
Cover the wound!

02:54.760 --> 02:55.640
Look at me.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.640
Easy.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.880
It's a scratch on the side,
that's all.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.800
On his side.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.600
There's no exit hole.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.080
The bullet's inside.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.240
Nairobi!

03:09.320 --> 03:10.840
-I'm here!
-For fuck's sake.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.200
He's bleeding out.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.480
Don't worry, son.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.760
I've got loads of blood.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.280
I've eaten lots of blood sausage.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.640
Okay, hold him in place.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.040
Berlin,

03:21.120 --> 03:22.320
-morphine.
-Relax.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.240
-Here we go. Okay.
-Ready!

03:25.320 --> 03:26.880
I'm starting a line for him.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.280
Okay,

03:28.360 --> 03:29.760
-Here.
-Let me, let me.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.840
Come on, come on.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.360
Pull this, Denver.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.120
Wait, wait!

03:47.800 --> 03:49.160
I'm starting a line for him.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.560
Breathe slowly.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.440
Breathe slower.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.960
-His pulse is shooting up.
-Gauze!

04:04.560 --> 04:05.400
That's it.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.080
Relax, Moscow.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.200
Moscow, relax.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.200
Listen,
you're going to be okay.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.000
Right? You'll be okay.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.160
-Yes.
-Right?

04:16.400 --> 04:17.480
It's okay, Moscow.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.440
It's okay, Moscow.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
Relax.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.520
Relax.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.840
They put three bullets in him, Rio.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.600
Three bullets.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.840
TUESDAY 07:35 PM

05:04.520 --> 05:07.280
HOUR 105 OF THE HEIST

05:17.560 --> 05:19.160
-Son of a bitch.
-Raquel.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
I broke free.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.920
I could have escaped.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.480
I could have killed you, Raquel.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.920
You didn't believe that polygraph either.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.920
Look,
this proves that I'm telling the truth.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.080
You just fucked up
with this act of love,

06:10.160 --> 06:12.560
because
I'm putting you away for 80 years.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.600
Get up.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.240
Slowly.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.680
Hands on your head and turn around.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.520
Don't move...
What the hell are you doing?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.040
Don't move. Don't move!

07:47.240 --> 07:48.320
I said don't move!

07:54.760 --> 07:55.960
Hands on your head!

08:08.640 --> 08:10.040
Not a single step more.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.600
Raquel, I'm not stopping.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.120
You're going to have to kill me.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.480
Fuck!

09:12.360 --> 09:14.160
Son of a bitch, my phone!

10:03.160 --> 10:04.120
Three bullets!

10:04.880 --> 10:06.800
They put three bullets in his
stomach!

10:09.880 --> 10:10.920
We must call a doctor.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.720
There's nothing we can do.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.200
It's time to keep a cool head,
Tokyo.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.480
I'm not just thinking about Moscow.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.600
-I'm going to call the Professor.
-The Professor is gone!

10:24.000 --> 10:26.240
I've called many times.
He's not in the hangar.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.760
I don't know where he is!

10:29.920 --> 10:32.680
-We must call Inspector Murillo.
-We can't do it!

10:32.800 --> 10:34.520
You know.
It's not part of the plan.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.520
What plan?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.120
You know what my plan was?

10:39.880 --> 10:40.760
To kill you.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.920
But Moscow is the one dying.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.480
So don't tell me what's not
part of the fucking plan.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.080
This is Colonel Prieto speaking.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.040
I'd like to speak
with Inspector Murillo, please.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.600
The CNI has taken charge.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Colonel,

11:18.400 --> 11:19.480
It's Fonollosa.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.040
I'd like to ask
what you're wearing

11:22.120 --> 11:23.720
but no time for chit-chat,

11:23.800 --> 11:25.960
since you just put three bullets
in our man.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.600
I want a surgeon in here.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.880
Now.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.520
Do you know what I want?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.800
For you to stop fucking with me.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.520
You pulled Silene Oliveira
out of a police van

11:35.600 --> 11:37.240
and got her back in the mint.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.120
You placed explosive devices that,
thank God,

11:40.600 --> 11:41.440
didn't work.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.520
Do you really think can make requests?

11:46.120 --> 11:48.480
Look,
it was a clean rescue on our part.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.680
You guys started shooting.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.840
It would be nice of you
to help save this man's life.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.280
Listen carefully.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.560
If you want to save him,
bring him through the main door, unarmed,

12:00.640 --> 12:02.960
and an ambulance will be waiting for him.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.760
We're not turning our man in,
Colonel.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.920
Then you'll have another corpse
on your hands.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.240
Have you tracked down the inspector?

12:14.480 --> 12:15.520
We're working on it.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.400
SAN GABRIEL HILLS 12 LOT SPECIAL
DARE TO DREAM OF YOUR NEW LIFE

13:57.280 --> 13:58.200
Helsinki,

13:58.320 --> 13:59.360
how does it look?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.160
It's not a shot in the leg.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.200
The stomach is a bad area,
Moscow.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.320
Very bad.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.960
We need a surgeon.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.000
Honestly,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.360
how much time do we have?

14:18.000 --> 14:18.880
Hours.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.080
Eleven.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.360
Twelve, thirteen.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.960
Without a surgeon
there's nothing we can do.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.960
How many times was I hit?

14:34.840 --> 14:35.880
Three, Papa.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.360
Three times.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.000
Some mess I've got down there.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.000
Moscow,

14:47.440 --> 14:49.600
-What?
-They won't send in a surgical team.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.840
But we have an ambulance out there
to take you to the hospital.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.200
You can tell them
that they can go fuck themselves,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
because I'm not going back to jail.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.560
That hole

15:10.080 --> 15:11.120
it's almost finished

15:11.600 --> 15:12.920
to get to the other side.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.480
That's ten hours of work.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.800
Get digging.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.360
I'll hang in here, okay?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.040
Hang in there, Papa.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.080
I'll open that tunnel
even if I have to headbutt my way through.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.080
People,

15:28.320 --> 15:29.720
we're getting out of here.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.120
There was a shootout. What happened?

15:45.240 --> 15:46.520
Moscow is full of holes.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.360
Three gunshots.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.080
Where?

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
In the stomach.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.960
I don't think they hit his liver.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.880
I don't know about the rest.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.360
How is it looking?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.400
Fucked.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.560
But Moscow says he won't go out.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.520
That we can finish the tunnel soon.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.480
I have the Serbs here.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.000
We're going to start digging
from this side too.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.480
And I'll find the Ukrainian doctor.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.800
Anyway you have to get out
as soon as possible.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.960
I've been discovered, Andres.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.040
I don't know how long before the
police show up.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.560
Any news?

16:40.320 --> 16:41.280
What's the matter?

16:43.400 --> 16:44.360
What's he doing here?

16:46.360 --> 16:48.760
Someone will tell me what is going on?

16:48.840 --> 16:51.400
Did you know Sergio Marquina,
the Professor, is Salva?

16:51.480 --> 16:53.040
The mastermind of the heist.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.600
The man you've been seeing
at the bar for five days.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.160
Yes.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.480
I found out a few hours ago.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.240
You got a call from that man.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.160
He called
from the station in Canillas,

17:05.240 --> 17:06.440
where he was in custody.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.960
Minutes later you arrived.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.360
You made a scene
to get him out of there,

17:11.440 --> 17:13.000
and destroyed his fingerprints.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.640
I didn't know who he was.

17:15.320 --> 17:16.800
The evidence you destroyed

17:16.880 --> 17:19.080
identified him
breaking into the police car

17:19.160 --> 17:22.160
to threaten the Russian
in order to avoid the facial composite.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.960
The man who erased the fingerprints

17:24.040 --> 17:25.840
on the car found in the junkyard

17:25.920 --> 17:28.440
from which Angel took a teaspoon
that proved him guilty

17:28.520 --> 17:29.960
before having a fatal accident.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.800
You took him
to the gang's house in Toledo, right?

17:32.920 --> 17:34.080
You put him in my car,

17:34.160 --> 17:36.920
where I kept the only legal evidence
I found in the house.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.080
The paper from the fireplace
and the evidence disappeared.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.160
Apparently after leaving
Inspector Vicuña unconscious,

17:43.240 --> 17:46.240
and when Angel did his job
and reported his suspicions,

17:47.040 --> 17:48.840
you dropped him
from the investigation.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.440
And to top it off,
while destroying your partner,

17:52.520 --> 17:54.600
you were screwing
the leader of the gang.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.160
Fine.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.600
Fine.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.720
First of all,

18:06.400 --> 18:07.840
that man can't be here.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.760
He has a restraining order.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.240
So if he's not 500 feet away from me
in five minutes,

18:13.440 --> 18:14.840
I'll have him arrested.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.840
I didn't know who he was.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.120
And I'll prove it.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.800
I can tell you where he's hiding.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.520
TUESDAY 10:15 PM

18:46.240 --> 18:49.000
THREE HOURS SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

18:50.440 --> 18:52.280
What the fuck did you do?

18:52.360 --> 18:54.880
You left my mother at a roundabout?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.920
You had me believe she was a bitch.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.520
It was her or us.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.840
I won't break your skull

19:03.920 --> 19:05.640
because we need you to get out.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.240
When we get out,

19:08.000 --> 19:09.440
you and I are nothing.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.920
Two strangers,

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
Denver

19:13.680 --> 19:15.000
and Moscow.

19:15.080 --> 19:15.960
Fuck!

19:46.400 --> 19:48.840
Can anyone tell me
what the fuck this is?

19:49.120 --> 19:50.000
Please,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.160
not like that.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.880
We said little rolls
of a million each, please.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.960
Max it out, dammit.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.320
We'll keep printing bills
for a few more hours.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.040
Then stop the machines and erase the logs.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.000
I want everybody working to the max!

20:09.320 --> 20:10.560
We're getting out of here!

20:12.200 --> 20:13.080
That's right.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.880
I've been told of another very good place

20:16.200 --> 20:17.600
at the Federal Reserve.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.240
Come here a minute.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
How's Moscow?

20:25.000 --> 20:25.880
He's stable.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.560
We still have a few hours,
don't we?

20:29.400 --> 20:31.480
Should we start making 500 euro bills?

20:33.640 --> 20:36.400
The 500 euro bills are
for Russians and tacky people.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.280
I'm not Russian. Do I look tacky?

20:38.720 --> 20:40.680
My tastes might be questionable but...

20:40.760 --> 20:42.880
Berlin, are we printing them or not?

20:45.280 --> 20:46.880
100 and 200 euro bills.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.520
Torres!

20:49.920 --> 20:50.880
Torres,

20:52.400 --> 20:53.600
stop the machines,

20:54.160 --> 20:55.360
change the plates,

20:55.840 --> 20:57.960
and start making 100 and 200 bills.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.160
Yes, ma'am.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.280
You like to jump puddles
from one stone to another

21:16.080 --> 21:18.160
and every time you step a stone sinks.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.040
You're leaving dead bodies
by the roadside.

21:27.240 --> 21:30.360
Was it your idea or your boyfriend's
to rob the armored car?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.160
Well, now your boyfriend is dead

21:45.320 --> 21:46.360
and so is your mother.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.760
I'm sure you knew the pain
you were causing your mother.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.520
I thought I'd never see you again.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.320
What's the matter?

22:34.400 --> 22:35.280
He told me.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.040
I leave dead bodies behind
wherever I go.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.960
Berlin kicked me out
and I came back.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.400
And I've put everyone's lives in
danger.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.560
I just had to come back, didn't I?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.680
And now the dead body is Moscow.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.640
Moscow isn't a dead body, okay?

22:58.440 --> 22:59.520
He'll make it.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.200
and we'll get out of here together.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.440
I'm a black cat
that curses the people it crosses.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.360
No.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.360
You're a black panther,

23:10.240 --> 23:11.120
my black panther.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
How are you?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.800
Right now I'm fucking great.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.240
You have no fucking idea
how much I love you.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.560
No fucking idea.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.240
I love you too.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.800
I have missed you.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.600
Let's start getting the money out of here.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.560
Come on, come on!

24:10.200 --> 24:11.920
The ones in other room, too!

24:19.120 --> 24:20.960
Ariadna, Ariadna.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.240
Not you.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.440
Come.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.600
Put that down.

24:50.000 --> 24:50.880
Denver.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.320
Denver!

24:54.480 --> 24:55.320
Listen,

24:55.880 --> 24:57.760
Denver, you have to stop.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.360
-It's pointless.
-What?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.240
Put the pick down

25:04.200 --> 25:06.600
and convince your father
to turn himself in.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.440
He has to get to a hospital.
He can't wait.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.040
This tunnel is the only way
out and I'm leaving with my father.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.400
You know why?

25:17.440 --> 25:18.280
Why?

25:20.080 --> 25:21.520
Because when we get out of here

25:22.320 --> 25:24.520
you won't be wearing
a red jumpsuit anymore.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.720
You'll be dressed in white,

25:26.960 --> 25:27.800
gorgeous.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.320
And I'll be waiting at the altar.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.880
And I need him to be there by my side,

25:33.240 --> 25:34.160
and to see it.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.640
For him to grab me by the shoulder
and get goosebumps, okay?

25:38.000 --> 25:38.920
I'm not stopping.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.520
I'm not stopping.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.120
So, shall we do this?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.520
Let's do this!

25:47.120 --> 25:48.240
-Let's do it!
-Let's go.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.720
Just a bit more!

25:53.800 --> 25:56.200
-Just a little more, dammit!
-Just a bit, Rio!

25:56.280 --> 25:57.240
Less than two meters!

26:00.000 --> 26:01.960
Have you thought about my proposal?

26:05.960 --> 26:09.520
A short but passionate love story

26:10.960 --> 26:12.000
in a tropical country.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.280
And a proper inheritance.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.960
Eight hundred million euros
that go to you.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.960
That's the least important part,
Berlin.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.760
I like the idea of going away with you

26:33.000 --> 26:34.480
but it makes me sad because

26:34.800 --> 26:35.840
you're going to die.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.080
You'll make a gorgeous widow.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.920
We have to get married.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.320
Right, Ariadna?

26:58.240 --> 26:59.360
I've never done it

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
dressed in white

27:02.520 --> 27:03.480
at night.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.080
How about on a beach,

27:07.480 --> 27:11.960
under the stars, in a wild ritual
with lots of light,

27:13.480 --> 27:14.480
and lots of fire.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.760
Beautiful.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.240
Would you marry me, Ariadna?

27:37.400 --> 27:40.800
I'm sure some people think
that living with a dying man

27:41.240 --> 27:42.160
is boring and

27:42.560 --> 27:43.440
they're wrong.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.440
It's the opposite.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.480
It's going all in.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.200
Driving without the safety belt on.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.560
Riding a motorcycle without a
helmet.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.720
Scuba diving without an oxygen tank.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.960
Letting go of the reins for good,
no limits.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.760
What about babies?

28:22.240 --> 28:26.320
What do you think? Some mini Berlins
running along the beach.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.320
Just kidding.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.200
So the address you gave us
is where Mr. Marquina

28:54.280 --> 28:56.360
supposedly set up his operations center.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.000
In that cider bar, right?

28:58.720 --> 28:59.640
Yes.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.080
What's this?

29:02.280 --> 29:03.520
It's a warehouse.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.400
There's nothing in there.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.120
A beat-up car, junk.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.080
But no sign of an operations center.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.400
Are you sure about the address
you gave us?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.600
Of course I am.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.160
I was there.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.440
What were you doing there?

29:36.520 --> 29:37.440
Making love.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.240
Our first rule was no names,

29:49.480 --> 29:51.040
no personal relationships.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.880
The Professor had envisioned
a heist with no attachments,

29:55.800 --> 29:56.960
but when I saw him there,

29:58.040 --> 29:58.960
smiling at me,

29:59.400 --> 30:01.760
I realized that he was
the closest thing to a father

30:01.840 --> 30:03.280
that I had ever had.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.360
What's so funny,

30:05.880 --> 30:06.760
big guy?

30:07.640 --> 30:08.880
Your bright ideas.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.560
Escaping

30:12.880 --> 30:14.720
just to come back to the factory.

30:15.200 --> 30:16.120
You know it.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.640
Dressed like a cop and everything.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.000
Like James Bond.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.400
That must have really pissed them.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.240
He's shaking.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.680
Moscow. Hey.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.160
He's white as the snow in Stalingrad.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.760
He's got a pulse of 35.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.240
He needs a transfusion.
Get the plasma.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.600
-Moscow.
-Come on.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.200
O-negative.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.440
Hey.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
-Over here.
-Moscow.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.560
There we go, you're with us.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.800
It's okay. Are you okay?

30:55.840 --> 30:57.640
It's okay, you're with us.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.360
You're right here with us, okay?

31:02.640 --> 31:05.240
WEDNESDAY 07:02 AM

31:10.360 --> 31:13.120
11 HOURS SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

32:00.880 --> 32:02.480
How's the tunnel going?

32:04.320 --> 32:05.520
We're really close.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.920
Hey, dear.

32:20.120 --> 32:20.960
Girl.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.240
Why don't you get some rest?

32:26.440 --> 32:27.720
-Alright?
-Alright.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.240
Let's go.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.640
Here you go, keep working.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
Inspector.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.240
I'm afraid she can't answer the phone.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.680
She's investigated for
collaboration in the heist

33:42.760 --> 33:44.480
and obstruction of justice.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.440
But surely you already know that,

33:46.520 --> 33:49.120
I mean, since you have
such a special relationship.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.480
We know who you are, Salva.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.080
Or should I say,

33:53.520 --> 33:54.720
Sergio Marquina.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.040
So there's no need for you to use
that GPS voice anymore.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.240
Colonel Prieto,

34:15.320 --> 34:18.240
We have a man dying here
because of your gunfire.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.720
If you don't send a doctor in now,

34:22.400 --> 34:23.960
you'll have signed his sentence.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.800
The only one who signed
his sentence is you.

34:26.960 --> 34:31.280
His and that of all the people whose lives
you're destroying with this heist.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.320
Including your friend, the inspector.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.720
How can you bear having
that on your conscience?

34:36.840 --> 34:38.560
Look, if you want

34:39.280 --> 34:42.400
to chat about our conscience,
we can do so later.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.760
But right now we need a doctor.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.960
There will be no "later", Mr. Marquina.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.520
We know you're close.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.560
And we know the location
of the three antennas

34:52.640 --> 34:56.600
that recorded your calls
to the inspector over the last five days.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.040
We'll search every house.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.680
And when you least expect it,
we'll be knocking on your door.

35:04.960 --> 35:09.320
So stop complicating things
and surrender.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.800
Like I told the inspector,

35:14.160 --> 35:16.440
surrendering was never an option.

35:18.840 --> 35:19.960
I'll be here waiting.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.720
Not everyone is letting us
into their homes.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.760
Many people are on their side.
They're heroes on TV.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.640
We're the guys who want to catch them.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.560
Call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.600
We can't bust into 10,000 homes.

35:41.880 --> 35:46.560
The antennas cover an 850-meter radius.
We have to narrow it down.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.400
Fine, we'll narrow it down.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.360
But call Judge Andrade
and request a search warrant.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.760
I see you've got it all under control.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.840
I don't understand what I'm doing here.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.840
-Am I under arrest?
-No, you're not under arrest.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.200
You're being investigated.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.480
Okay,

36:02.960 --> 36:04.080
then I'm leaving.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.040
Inspector.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.040
Before you leave,
turn in your badge and your gun.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.320
Tap my phone if you want!

36:28.960 --> 36:30.120
Wait, wait.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.720
You go ahead,
I'll get you a new jumpsuit.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.560
Hi.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.440
Ari.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.920
Why did you sabotage the escape plan?

37:24.520 --> 37:25.600
Because of Denver?

37:29.520 --> 37:32.360
You hit Arturo
because you two have something.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.120
-Monica, did he force you?
-No.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.360
Why are you with him?

37:48.840 --> 37:50.000
Because I love him.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.000
Because I love him, I know

37:55.560 --> 37:57.080
it may sound ridiculous.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.400
You might think it's crazy but...

38:00.360 --> 38:01.240
it's real.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.120
It's real, Ari.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.760
It's the first time someone has

38:06.760 --> 38:09.720
looked me in the eye and is honest.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.160
He really loves me.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.200
And you...

38:19.000 --> 38:20.120
you're with Berlin?

38:29.120 --> 38:30.560
Just for survival.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.880
I thought they were killing people.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.600
And that they had killed you too.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.240
I thought I was saving myself.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.160
Come here.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.280
Berlin disgusts me, he makes me sick.

38:53.640 --> 38:56.000
And now the asshole thinks
I have feelings for him,

38:56.080 --> 38:57.680
that we are living a love story.

38:58.120 --> 39:00.120
He wants me to marry him
when we get out,

39:00.200 --> 39:01.400
to take care of him.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.920
He's sick.

39:03.000 --> 39:03.880
I know.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.680
And are you going to do it?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.680
It'll only be a year.
I don't know, we're going

39:12.640 --> 39:13.920
to travel the world.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.760
Living like kings.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.520
And going...

39:19.200 --> 39:20.880
to fancy places and that's it.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.480
Thousands of people
accept these proposals every day.

39:26.080 --> 39:27.000
Ari...

39:28.520 --> 39:29.840
But is it worth it?

39:32.360 --> 39:34.640
I'm going to keep all of his money.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.680
He fucked up my life, Monica.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.320
I take four tranquilizers a day
just to be able to bare his presence.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.720
He raped me.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.440
He raped me.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.120
When he's by my side
and he can no longer move,

39:49.200 --> 39:50.480
when he has only me,

39:50.640 --> 39:54.200
I'll tell him what a son of bitch he is
for all he's done to me.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.200
The calls made by the suspect
over the last five days

40:24.280 --> 40:27.440
were recorded by these three antennas,
located here,

40:28.000 --> 40:32.520
here and here. except the one he made
from the Canillas police station.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.480
You were right. It's a wide radius.

40:36.120 --> 40:38.960
Gomez, ask telecom
to triangulate the signal

40:39.040 --> 40:41.400
to limit the suspect's area of activity.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.240
Everything would be easier
if Angel was here.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.600
He's the only one who knows
the exact location of the hideout.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.040
The inspector was
at the edge of the abyss,

41:25.400 --> 41:28.160
balancing herself
to avoid falling into it for good.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.040
Thinking about how ridiculous it was

41:31.120 --> 41:35.080
to have gone from inspector to suspect
in a couple of minutes.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.640
And she decided to do what her mother
had so often told her to do.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.600
Chase after the bad guys.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.000
