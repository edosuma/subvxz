12:28.294 --> 12:31.064
YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.

12:31.064 --> 12:33.099
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

12:33.099 --> 12:35.435
YOU'RE ONLY SAYING
WHAT I WANT YOU TO SAY,

12:35.435 --> 12:36.970
WHEN PROMPTED.
AH.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.605
OKAY.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.206
ERICA?
MM‐HMM?

12:40.206 --> 12:42.342
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

12:42.342 --> 12:45.512
YOU SMELL LIKE A ROSE,
A CALYPSO ROSE,

12:45.512 --> 12:48.281
WHICH IS MY FAVORITE.

12:48.281 --> 12:51.451
YOUR LIPS MAKE MY MOUTH WATER,

12:51.451 --> 12:56.456
YOUR SKIN IS LIKE
SILK TO MY TOUCH.

12:56.456 --> 12:59.325
WHEN YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES,
I GET HOT.

12:59.325 --> 13:03.469
WHEN MY HAND IS
ON THE SMALL OF YOUR BACK,

13:03.469 --> 13:07.040
I GET HARD.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.644
RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO TAKE OFF
THIS NICE DRESS,

13:10.644 --> 13:12.713
THROW YOU ON THAT BED,
AND MAKE LOVE TO YOU

13:12.713 --> 13:14.548
UNTIL THE SUN COMES UP.

13:18.351 --> 13:19.986
WELL, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DO THAT.

13:19.986 --> 13:21.254
WHY NOT?

13:21.254 --> 13:22.656
I...

13:22.656 --> 13:25.225
DAVID, I LIKE YOU.
AND I LIKE YOU.

13:28.361 --> 13:31.431
WHO IS THIS PERSON?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:31.431 --> 13:34.034
WELL, I FEEL LIKE YOU
JUST SWITCHED IT UP ON ME.

13:34.034 --> 13:37.137
DID I?
YEAH.

13:37.137 --> 13:40.273
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

13:40.273 --> 13:42.408
A LITTLE.
GOOD.

13:42.408 --> 13:43.877
YOU'VE BEEN
TOO COMFORTABLE WITH ME

13:43.877 --> 13:47.113
AND I HAVE BEEN TOO NICE.

13:47.113 --> 13:51.417
I'M NOT SURE "GENTLEMAN"
IS YOUR THING.

13:51.417 --> 13:55.221
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
I DON'T KNOW...

13:55.221 --> 13:58.424
JUST ‐‐ JUST A FEELING.

13:58.424 --> 14:01.301
WE SHOULD GO TO DINNER.

14:01.301 --> 14:03.403
YES. WE SHOULD.

14:05.438 --> 14:07.808
SHALL WE?

14:07.808 --> 14:09.676
AFTER YOU.

14:22.823 --> 14:24.490
BEHIND THE TAPE, MA'AM.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.259
WHO'S THE OFFICER
IN CHARGE OF THIS CIRCUS?

14:26.259 --> 14:28.762
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED IN HERE.
YES, I AM.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.564
GET HER OUT OF HERE,
OR YOU WILL BE ARRESTED.

14:30.564 --> 14:32.465
MY NAME IS VERONICA HARRINGTON.

14:32.465 --> 14:34.835
I AM THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING
CANDACE YOUNG,

14:34.835 --> 14:36.269
WHO IS THE HOMEOWNER.

14:36.269 --> 14:38.171
NOW, I'M GOING TO NEED
EVERYONE TO STOP DOING

14:38.171 --> 14:40.240
WHAT THEY'RE DOING UNTIL
I SEE A SEARCH WARRANT.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.175
MA'AM, I NEED YOU ‐‐
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, SON?

14:42.175 --> 14:45.178
HMM? WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
WHAT IS YOUR BADGE NUMBER?

14:45.178 --> 14:46.412
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE YOU ‐‐

14:46.412 --> 14:49.182
IT'S OKAY,
I GOT THIS, MICKEY.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.817
VERONICA.

14:50.817 --> 14:55.088
GEORGE.

14:55.088 --> 14:56.890
YOU KNOW...
MISS YOUNG?

14:56.890 --> 14:58.659
I'M HER ATTORNEY.

14:58.659 --> 15:00.627
WELL, THIS IS
PRETTY CUT AND DRY.

15:00.627 --> 15:02.836
MMM. MAY I SEE
THE SEARCH WARRANT, PLEASE?

15:02.836 --> 15:05.271
YES. SURE. OFFICER?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.641
THE WARRANT.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.511
IT'S ALL HERE,
SIGNED BY JUDGE SEVERS.

15:10.511 --> 15:13.013
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
THIS IS AN ACTIVE CRIME SCENE

15:13.013 --> 15:14.480
AND THIS WARRANT
ALLOWS US TO ‐‐

15:14.480 --> 15:17.117
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.484
I'M SORRY?

15:18.484 --> 15:20.386
NO, I'M SORRY.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.888
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:21.888 --> 15:24.558
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS
IS NOT A GOOD WARRANT.

15:24.558 --> 15:27.528
VERONICA...
IT'S NOT.

15:27.528 --> 15:28.862
IT'S A GOOD WARRANT.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.131
WE HAVE A RIGHT
TO SEARCH THE PREMISES.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.633
YES, YOU DO.

15:32.633 --> 15:36.002
BUT THAT WARRANT IS
FOR THE CURRENT HOMEOWNER.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.138
WHAT?
YES, WE KNOW THAT.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.741
CANDACE YOUNG IS NOT
THE CURRENT HOMEOWNER.

15:40.741 --> 15:44.477
THIS HOME IS OWNED BY THE BANK,
AS OF THIS AFTERNOON.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.246
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU ‐‐

15:46.246 --> 15:48.549
I HAVE A REPORT
RIGHT HERE FROM THE BANK.

15:48.549 --> 15:50.917
IT'S ALL ON RECORD...

15:50.917 --> 15:52.118
RECORDED THIS EVENING,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.020
AFTER HOURS.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.822
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?

15:55.822 --> 15:58.625
SO ANYTHING YOU FOUND
AFTER 5:00 IS NOT ADMISSIBLE.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.367
YEAH? WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.336
MMM.

16:03.336 --> 16:07.774
YES, WE WILL.

16:07.774 --> 16:09.810
GEORGE, YOU KNOW ME.

16:09.810 --> 16:12.245
YEAH, I KNOW YOU.

16:12.245 --> 16:13.714
YOU PLAY DIRTY.

16:13.714 --> 16:15.315
I DON'T HAVE TO
IN THIS CASE.

16:15.315 --> 16:17.317
WHAT TIME DID YOU
FIND THE BODY?

16:17.317 --> 16:18.652
WE FOUND IT AT...

16:18.652 --> 16:20.153
GO AHEAD AND LIE.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.088
I'M GOING TO SEE THE JUDGE
IN THE MORNING AGAIN.

16:22.088 --> 16:24.124
THAT WILL BE THE FIRST THING
I TELL HIM.

16:24.124 --> 16:26.727
WE FOUND IT AT 6:00.
I KNOW THAT.

16:26.727 --> 16:28.595
I HAVE THE LOGS
WITH ALL THE CALLS

16:28.595 --> 16:30.496
YOU MADE INTO THE STATION.

16:30.496 --> 16:34.067
VERONICA.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.169
BABY, THAT BODY
IS INADMISSIBLE.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.871
THIS GIRL KILLED HIM.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
YES, I DO.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.642
WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE
A BODY TO PROVE IT.

16:44.244 --> 16:46.146
VERONICA, I ‐‐
YOU ARE SPEECHLESS,

16:46.146 --> 16:48.615
IS WHAT YOU ARE.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.885
NOW, DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT
FOR HER ARREST?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.186
WE JUST WANT
TO TALK TO HER.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.255
WELL, THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING.

16:55.255 --> 16:57.658
THEN WE'LL HAVE
TO CHARGE HER.

16:57.658 --> 17:02.168
OKAY. I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT IN THE MORNING.

17:02.168 --> 17:04.337
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO DO THIS?

17:04.337 --> 17:06.139
EXCUSE ME?

17:06.139 --> 17:08.474
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A TRIAL
OF YOUR OWN PENDING.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.546
AND I WILL WIN THAT ONE,

17:12.546 --> 17:15.015
THE SAME WAY
I'M GOING TO WIN THIS ONE.

17:15.015 --> 17:16.917
YEAH.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.820
OKAY.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.354
SO I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

17:21.354 --> 17:22.623
I GUESS YOU WILL.

17:22.623 --> 17:25.391
BUT AS LONG AS
WE'RE ON THIS THING,

17:25.391 --> 17:28.762
I WILL CHARGE HER.

17:28.762 --> 17:31.932
YEAH. YOU WANT TO GO
DOWN THIS ROAD,

17:31.932 --> 17:34.968
I WILL GO AND PICK
HER UP TONIGHT.

17:34.968 --> 17:36.937
SHE WON'T TALK TO YOU.

17:36.937 --> 17:39.940
WELL, WE'LL SEE.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.341
EVEN AFTER I'M TELLING YOU

17:41.341 --> 17:42.976
THAT SHE'S REPRESENTED
BY COUNSEL?

17:42.976 --> 17:44.477
HMM.
YEAH.

17:44.477 --> 17:47.113
OKAY.

17:47.113 --> 17:49.816
OKAY.

17:49.816 --> 17:51.685
GOODNIGHT, GEORGE.

17:51.685 --> 17:54.320
HEY, UM, VERONICA?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.957
WHAT KIND OF CAR
DOES YOUR SON DRIVE?

17:58.992 --> 18:00.493
EXCUSE ME?

18:00.493 --> 18:02.368
OH, YOU SEE, WE...

18:02.368 --> 18:05.138
FOUND SOME KEYS
FROM A JAGUAR.

18:05.138 --> 18:06.873
AND WE CALLED IT IN,
THE SERIAL NUMBER,

18:06.873 --> 18:12.078
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
REGISTERED TO HARRINGTON.

18:12.078 --> 18:14.748
I BELIEVE THAT
IT'S YOUR SON'S CAR.

18:14.748 --> 18:16.617
NOW...

18:16.617 --> 18:19.052
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY YOUR SON'S CAR KEYS

18:19.052 --> 18:21.822
WERE WITH A DEAD BODY?

18:21.822 --> 18:23.289
NO.

18:23.289 --> 18:25.158
BUT I DO WANT TO SEE YOU
IN COURT IN THE MORNING.

18:25.158 --> 18:28.762
MMM. WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
PICK HIM UP, TOO.

18:28.762 --> 18:30.196
WELL, DO WHAT YOU MUST.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.265
OH, I WILL.

18:32.265 --> 18:34.801
ALL RIGHT, GOODNIGHT, GEORGE.

18:34.801 --> 18:36.436
ONE MORE THING.
YES?

18:36.436 --> 18:38.805
WE'RE GOING TO PAY
YOUR OLD PAL JIM CRYER

18:38.805 --> 18:42.709
AND HIS WIFE A VISIT.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.712
OKAY. ARE YOU ARRESTING HIM
FOR THIS, TOO?

18:45.712 --> 18:47.380
MAYBE.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.049
NOW, WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH THIS?

18:49.049 --> 18:51.718
ARE YOU HIS ATTORNEY, TOO?
NO, I'M NOT.

18:51.718 --> 18:54.320
WELL THEN, I GUESS
I'LL TALK TO HIS ATTORNEY

18:54.320 --> 18:56.790
AFTER WE GO OVER TO HIS HOUSE
AND TALK TO HIM.

18:59.392 --> 19:01.935
WELL, IF IT'S BIG,

19:01.935 --> 19:04.404
I WILL BE THE FIRST
PERSON THEY CALL.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.472
I'M SURE.

19:06.472 --> 19:08.274
GOODNIGHT, GEORGE.
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:08.274 --> 19:11.545
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

19:19.786 --> 19:21.855
SO WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE THE DEVIL,

19:21.855 --> 19:24.591
YOU JUST SHOW UP?

19:24.591 --> 19:28.729
YOU NEED TO GET OFF
MY CAR, DARLING.

19:28.729 --> 19:31.464
MY, OH, MY, DON'T YOU LOOK
LOVELY THIS EVENING, VERONICA?

19:31.464 --> 19:33.399
YOU LOOK SLIMY.

19:33.399 --> 19:35.936
THANK YOU.

19:37.971 --> 19:40.306
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:40.306 --> 19:42.609
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

19:42.609 --> 19:45.378
FOR?
KATHERYN.

19:45.378 --> 19:49.516
OH, YOU NEED TO BACK UP
A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT.

19:49.516 --> 19:52.218
REALLY? WHAT?

19:52.218 --> 19:54.721
TRYING TO CHOKE ME.

19:54.721 --> 19:57.724
WELL, YOU DID HAVE
MY SON RAPED IN JAIL.

19:57.724 --> 19:59.292
GET OVER IT.
GET OVER IT?

19:59.292 --> 20:00.727
YOU HEARD ME.

20:00.727 --> 20:02.769
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.306
OKAY, SO GO ON AND APOLOGIZE.

20:06.306 --> 20:10.010
I ALREADY DID THAT,
VERONICA, IN JAIL.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.477
YOU CALL THAT AN APOLOGY?

20:11.477 --> 20:15.782
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.483
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:17.483 --> 20:20.954
AS I SAID,
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

20:20.954 --> 20:23.957
THEN APOLOGIZE.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.259
I'M SORRY I ASSAULTED YOU,
VERONICA.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.094
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.930
I DON'T BELIEVE ME, EITHER.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.767
OKAY.

20:33.767 --> 20:36.169
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:36.169 --> 20:38.839
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU AND I...

20:38.839 --> 20:42.442
ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE
IN THIS MATTER.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.077
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:44.077 --> 20:45.946
I KNOW WHAT KATHERYN DID.

20:50.050 --> 20:54.621
YES. WHAT DID SHE DO?

20:54.621 --> 21:00.767
I KNOW THAT SHE TRIED
TO SAY YOU DID THAT ACT.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.869
AND I DIDN'T.
I KNOW THAT.

21:02.869 --> 21:04.505
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

21:04.505 --> 21:06.206
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.941
NOT YOUR STYLE.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.242
TOO MESSY.

21:09.242 --> 21:10.644
TOO CLUMSY.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.278
TOO CLOSE.

21:12.278 --> 21:14.748
TOO STUPID.

21:14.748 --> 21:18.118
YES, I AGREE.

21:18.118 --> 21:21.387
SEE, WHEN YOU PUT
A HIT OUT ON SOMEONE,

21:21.387 --> 21:23.256
YOU DON'T
GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

21:23.256 --> 21:25.859
YOU DON'T EVEN DELIVER
THE MONEY YOURSELF,

21:25.859 --> 21:29.530
YOU LEAVE IT AND LET
SOMEONE ELSE PICK IT UP.

21:29.530 --> 21:32.566
WHAT ON EARTH
DOES ANY OF THAT MEAN?

21:32.566 --> 21:34.535
I KNOW THAT YOU
PUT A HIT OUT ON ME.

21:34.535 --> 21:35.569
YES, I DID.

21:35.569 --> 21:37.070
AND I KNOW
THAT YOU CALLED IT OFF.

21:37.070 --> 21:40.607
YES, I DID.
WHY?

21:40.607 --> 21:42.308
I FELT BAD.

21:42.308 --> 21:45.478
OH. THAT'S BULL.

21:47.814 --> 21:50.350
DAVID ASKED ME TO.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, EITHER.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.987
THEN YOU ARE A VERY BAD
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

21:53.987 --> 21:55.522
THAT MAN LOVED YOU
TO A FAULT,

21:55.522 --> 21:58.759
UNTIL YOU ALLOWED ANOTHER MAN
INTO YOUR VEHICLE, VERONICA.

21:58.759 --> 22:00.934
JIM ‐‐ JIM ‐‐
HEY.

22:00.934 --> 22:03.737
THAT PICTURE HURT HIM.

22:03.737 --> 22:05.506
ALL RIGHT?

22:05.506 --> 22:07.574
HE CAME TO ME
WITH AGONY IN HIS EYES

22:07.574 --> 22:11.444
AND BEGGED ME NOT TO LET
ANY HARM COME TO YOU.

22:11.444 --> 22:12.813
SO I CALLED IT OFF.

22:12.813 --> 22:14.114
WELL, THANK YOU.

22:14.114 --> 22:15.348
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:15.348 --> 22:16.917
YOU ARE SO FULL OF IT.

22:16.917 --> 22:18.552
THEN WHY THE HELL
DID I DO IT?

22:18.552 --> 22:20.887
HMM?
I HAVE MY REASONS.

22:20.887 --> 22:22.656
REALLY?
LIKE?

22:22.656 --> 22:24.658
MINE.

22:24.658 --> 22:26.560
OH.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.828
COME ON, JUST
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

22:27.828 --> 22:30.363
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

22:30.363 --> 22:34.100
I KNOW EVERY CRIMINAL
IN THIS TOWN.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.869
SEE...

22:35.869 --> 22:37.938
YOU SHOULDN'T LET THESE DIAMONDS

22:37.938 --> 22:41.742
AND MY DIVA‐NESS FOOL YOU.

22:41.742 --> 22:43.744

GOING TO REACT TO IT.
