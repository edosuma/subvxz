00:01.250 --> 00:02.208
[theme music playing]

01:11.000 --> 01:12.583
[yelling]

01:24.333 --> 01:28.375
I'm... I'm not capable
of mastering anything like that!

01:28.375 --> 01:30.291
I... I can't!

01:33.166 --> 01:34.416
Electronic fuse.

01:34.416 --> 01:36.250
What in the world?

01:37.125 --> 01:38.333
No!

01:39.333 --> 01:42.333
The time travel sensor.
The others have started.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.833
They've gone back before you.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.208
You must get help
and stop them,

01:47.208 --> 01:49.083
before they change time forever.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.166
Let's do it!

02:10.375 --> 02:12.458
-Beautiful.
-[Wolverine] Who? Me?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.750
-Watch your language.
-[laughing]

02:15.750 --> 02:17.875
I meant the butterfly.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.000
I suppose you, too,
are beautiful,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.291
in your own unusual way.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.291
Last picnic I let you
talk me into.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.291
-Apple?
-Thank you.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.250
I shall avoid
the Garden of Eden
parallel Beast

02:29.250 --> 02:30.333
would surely make.

02:31.625 --> 02:35.083
Eve's apple was said
to contain knowledge.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.458
I have always
resisted the idea

02:37.458 --> 02:39.375
that knowledge ruined Paradise.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.625
What is that?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.708
[Xavier]
I have no idea!

02:44.708 --> 02:48.458
You think we could just
attract ants like normal people!

02:48.458 --> 02:50.000
[beeping]

02:50.583 --> 02:51.750
[blasts]

02:52.458 --> 02:55.125
[screaming]

03:01.416 --> 03:02.958
Are you okay, darling?

03:02.958 --> 03:04.000
What was that?

03:08.458 --> 03:10.583
[Storm]
The humans' aim is improving.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.708
[Beast]
Get down!

03:19.458 --> 03:20.458
What gives?

03:24.375 --> 03:26.083
Perhaps next time
you will listen.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.583
What are you doing here, McCoy?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.458
Milk and cookies run out
at the officer's tent?

03:32.125 --> 03:33.250
[Beast]
Bad news.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.083
The humans have sent in
another wave of land crabs.

04:04.291 --> 04:05.375
[heavy thudding]

04:13.083 --> 04:15.583
Look! They have
the leader surrounded.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.750
-Come on!
-Wait, Logan!

04:18.750 --> 04:20.875
We cannot hope
to stop them alone!

04:24.458 --> 04:25.833
No choice, darling.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.458
We got to help the leader.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.333
We lose Magneto,

04:30.875 --> 04:32.458
we lose the war!

04:38.750 --> 04:41.250
Hold on, General!
The cavalry's here!

04:46.458 --> 04:47.875
Advance!

04:47.875 --> 04:50.208
Push them back
into the river.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.708
Whirlwind, arise!

05:06.375 --> 05:08.250
[screaming]

05:08.708 --> 05:09.708
[Storm]
Logan!

05:10.833 --> 05:11.875
Get clear!

05:11.875 --> 05:13.000
[Storm screams]

05:14.458 --> 05:15.458
[grunts]

05:17.708 --> 05:18.708
[groaning]

05:33.333 --> 05:34.875
[grunting]

05:59.291 --> 06:00.583
An opening, sir!

06:00.583 --> 06:02.000
[Magneto]
Good work, McCoy!

06:02.583 --> 06:03.500
Forward!

06:13.875 --> 06:15.125
Hang on, my friend.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.375
[Wolverine]
Storm!

06:27.083 --> 06:29.458
-[groans]
-[Wolverine] Come on, Storm!

06:29.458 --> 06:30.833
Don't you leave me!

06:31.500 --> 06:34.458
Wolverine, do not worry.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.875
You are stuck with me
a little longer.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.000
Oh. You know it, darling.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
[thudding]

06:55.000 --> 06:57.583
The army has sent in
another wave of superhumans.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.958
[yells]

07:19.208 --> 07:20.375
-[groans]
-[Wolverine] Nurse!

07:21.375 --> 07:22.583
Where can I find Dr. Summers?

07:22.583 --> 07:24.583
[loud explosion]

07:24.583 --> 07:26.125
-[Bishop] LeBeau!
-Hang on!

07:32.250 --> 07:33.708
I will be fine, Logan.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.458
Just get us clear.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.458
You got it.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.583
What the heck is that?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.458
[Bishop]
We're too late!

07:44.458 --> 07:46.333
While we were traveling,
Fitzroy and Nimrod

07:46.333 --> 07:49.000
already nailed Xavier
and changed everything.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.708
In this world,
there aren't X-Men to help us.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.833
Then we go back to 1959

07:54.833 --> 07:56.625
and stop the assassination.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.000
But now we go alone.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.625
Talk! Now!

07:59.625 --> 08:01.250
While you can breathe.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.750
[Storm]
You had better do it!

08:02.750 --> 08:04.125
[Bishop]
Storm!

08:04.125 --> 08:06.625
He has a short fuse.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.500
Then there are still X-Men.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.083
How do you know
our names, roadkill?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.375
And what are X-Men?

08:13.750 --> 08:16.083
They are our heritage. You are.

08:16.708 --> 08:20.083
We've traveled from the future
to save your time, and our own.

08:21.291 --> 08:22.416
[screaming]

08:23.875 --> 08:25.875
What are you talking about?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.583
Why should we believe you?

08:27.583 --> 08:28.583
Ask yourself, Storm.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.125
How did we get here?
Behind your lines?

08:31.583 --> 08:32.708
How do we know you?

08:32.708 --> 08:33.958
Why would we risk our lives

08:33.958 --> 08:34.958
to talk to you?

08:34.958 --> 08:36.583
I do not know.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.500
It is all too difficult
to believe.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.458
[scoffs]
Look at this world.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.875
How are you gonna save us?

08:47.166 --> 08:49.125
With your help,
we're gonna save the life

08:49.125 --> 08:51.083
of Charles Xavier.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.958
Who is Charles Xavier?

09:34.833 --> 09:36.458
This is the mutant
we must protect.

09:36.958 --> 09:38.583
Professor Charles Xavier

09:38.583 --> 09:40.458
used his powers to bring mutants

09:40.458 --> 09:41.750
and non-mutants together.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.125
He established a school here,

09:45.125 --> 09:46.875
where he and his team
of X-Men lived

09:46.875 --> 09:49.083
and fought
for basic human rights.

09:49.083 --> 09:52.208
Until somebody from our time
went back and took him out.

09:55.125 --> 09:58.125
[Shard]
Xavier took his message
to people around the world.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.125
And when anti-mutant groups
sprang up,

10:01.125 --> 10:03.000
he put his life on the line.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.166
Wolverine, you and Storm
worked with him.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.708
It was a constant struggle.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.708
But it was better than this.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.125
Much better.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.875
That ain't hard to imagine.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.083
[Storm]
I can't believe it.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.333
All of this destruction,
all of this misery

10:20.750 --> 10:23.583
is due to the absence
of one man?

10:23.583 --> 10:26.500
One of the most
important men in history.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.875
I don't buy it! This is nuts!

10:28.875 --> 10:32.250
[Bishop]
Everything here, this
war, all that you know,

10:32.250 --> 10:34.833
was caused by a time traveler
from our future!

10:35.500 --> 10:38.250
We have to go back,
rescue Xavier,

10:38.250 --> 10:40.083
and keep this from happening.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.125
-[Wolverine] It's a trick!
-[Shard] Back off!

10:42.500 --> 10:45.000
The new Wolverine
is as dense as the old one.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.166
I believe them, Logan.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.458
If it will end
this perpetual war.

10:50.458 --> 10:51.833
Everything else with it?

10:52.333 --> 10:53.875
You saw the tapes.

10:53.875 --> 10:57.125
If we find a way to
save this Xavier clown,

10:57.125 --> 10:58.708
we'll end up working together,

10:59.166 --> 11:01.125
but not being together.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.625
Sorry, pal,
but you're right about that.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.166
My darling,

11:05.166 --> 11:07.416
would you condemn
the whole world

11:07.416 --> 11:09.250
just to keep our love?

11:09.250 --> 11:10.875
You bet I would.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.583
Why would I care
about anything else?

11:16.083 --> 11:17.500
Logan, I'm sorry.

11:20.583 --> 11:21.583
I'm ready to go.

11:22.625 --> 11:23.708
Are you with us?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.208
Yeah. You know I am.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.208
Thanks.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.458
This is our future,
before Fitzroy changed it.

11:45.708 --> 11:46.833
We were at war,

11:47.291 --> 11:49.458
but with the resistance
we had hope.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.583
[Storm]
Tell us what we must do.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.083
[Shard]
Stop the mutant traitor,
Fitzroy.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.833
This surveillance tape
first alerted us to his mission.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.166
So, do we have a deal?

12:08.166 --> 12:09.875
If we could time travel

12:09.875 --> 12:12.333
without you, mutant, we would.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.708
But I do not trust you, Fitzroy,

12:14.708 --> 12:17.333
so Nimrod will join your trip
across time

12:17.333 --> 12:19.500
to make sure
you perform the task

12:19.500 --> 12:21.000
and return.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.458
Ba-Bantam doesn't like this!

12:23.458 --> 12:25.291
Be quiet, you fool!

12:25.291 --> 12:27.416
[Mastermold]
Rid me
of this meddling professor,

12:27.416 --> 12:29.833
and his legacy,
mutant resistance,

12:29.833 --> 12:31.333
will cease to exist.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.166
Document your trip,

12:33.166 --> 12:34.375
for if successful,

12:34.375 --> 12:35.833
I may not know you.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.875
Succeed, and you shall be

12:37.875 --> 12:40.000
the most powerful mutant alive!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.458
I'll be the only mutant alive.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.125
Well said.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.250
You know what I require.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.583
[Mastermold]
Lobdell, I have a job for you.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.708
[Fitzroy]
He'll be fine in a few days.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.708
[Mastermold]
Whatever.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.708
Gently, master,

13:02.708 --> 13:05.416
I bruise easily...

13:05.416 --> 13:07.708
[Shard]
That and their destination
were all we got

13:07.708 --> 13:08.875
before they found the camera.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.166
They went to a small college
in New England,

13:11.166 --> 13:14.708
May 11th, 1959, 9:00 p.m.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.875
We've got to be there
when they arrive.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.250
We must touch base
in our time first,

13:19.250 --> 13:21.583
before the portal
can send us further back.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.500
We must hurry.
If the time change

13:23.500 --> 13:25.458
has already hit 2055,

13:25.458 --> 13:27.000
all of our efforts
will be for nothing.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.166
-Ready, Logan?
-Let's go.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.291
[Bishop]
Now!

13:37.000 --> 13:40.166
[John]
Charles, I think you're taking
too narrow a view of this.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.583
Professor Gray,

13:41.583 --> 13:43.625
I just can't see the world

13:43.625 --> 13:46.291
populated by human mutants.

13:46.291 --> 13:50.083
Remember, when a scientist says
that a thing is possible,

13:50.083 --> 13:52.333
he is almost always right.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.833
[both]
But when he says
a thing is impossible,

13:54.833 --> 13:57.125
he is almost always wrong.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.458
-[both laugh]
-Yes.

13:59.458 --> 14:02.250
but evolution
just isn't that quirky.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.833
We change gradually

14:04.833 --> 14:06.875
for a purpose.

14:06.875 --> 14:10.125
Besides,
Cindy's your future researcher.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.708
I just want to be
a simple family doctor.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.708
Well, I can't disagree
with your motives.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.583
Take care, Charles.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.083
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.875
[Bishop]
You are wrong, Charles.

14:22.875 --> 14:26.083
Single-generation
mutations are possible.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.583
We are both living proof of it.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.250
Who are you?

14:29.708 --> 14:31.458
And how do you know about me?

14:31.958 --> 14:35.750
I read a paper you wrote
on the subject in 1978.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.708
You see, time travel
is also possible.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.000
You're crazy!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.291
And who are you?

14:43.750 --> 14:46.583
Sorry, Xavier, no time
for chit-chat.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.083
The future depends
on us keeping you alive.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.458
Alive?

14:53.416 --> 14:54.958
[Shard]
So these were the hippie days.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.125
[BISHOP]
Beatnik days, Shard.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.333
Hippies came later, man.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.416
Take these to that freak show
over in the corner.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.625
Time travel? Parallel futures?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.458
Mutants and assassins?

15:12.166 --> 15:14.583
You can't expect me
to believe all this!

15:15.125 --> 15:17.000
Nevertheless, it is true.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.416
[Wolverine]
I'll take those.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.375
Hmm. Real coffee.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.375
It's been a while.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.875
[Shard]
I've been told
you can read our thoughts.

15:26.375 --> 15:27.708
Search Bishop's mind.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.458
You will see the truth
of what we are saying.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.583
I do not like to use my powers.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.333
But if you insist...

15:48.875 --> 15:51.625
I don't know how I came
to be a mutant.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.750
I would not have
chosen to be one.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.250
And I can't imagine
being the leader of anything.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.583
I want to be a doctor.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.000
Still, if what you say is true,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.208
it would appear
that I am destined

16:03.208 --> 16:04.708
to help humanity.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.333
They're doing what?

16:07.958 --> 16:10.458
That does it!
All right, wise guy,

16:10.458 --> 16:13.583
you and your freako comrades
can just hit the road!

16:13.583 --> 16:15.416
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?

16:15.416 --> 16:18.000
Bad enough I have to serve
you jerks from the college,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.208
but I ain't putting up
with any trouble
from their kind!

16:21.208 --> 16:23.625
Skin color prejudice?

16:23.625 --> 16:25.958
That's so pathetic,
it's almost quaint.

16:25.958 --> 16:27.708
It ain't quaint.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.583
Who are you calling pathetic?

16:30.083 --> 16:32.875
You mongrels must be
some kind of medical experiment.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.375
I think you just insulted

16:35.375 --> 16:37.125
the woman I love, lowlife.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.166
You okay, Professor?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.958
Yes, and please,
stop calling me that.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.166
Now, you can either apologize

16:45.625 --> 16:47.625
or I'm gonna show you

16:47.625 --> 16:50.458
how intolerant I can be.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.875
Aren't you going to stop him?

16:52.875 --> 16:54.833
Logan, do not hurt him!

16:54.833 --> 16:56.375
You should thank the lady.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.458
She just saved
your useless life.

17:00.625 --> 17:01.708
[grunts]

17:02.708 --> 17:04.583
[all screaming]

17:06.375 --> 17:07.583
Sorry about the ruckus.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.125
Did you have to do that?

17:09.125 --> 17:10.625
Forget about that!

17:10.625 --> 17:12.958
We're talking about
the future of the world.

17:12.958 --> 17:16.083
If you don't let us help you
in a couple of hours,
you'll be dead

17:16.083 --> 17:18.458
and everything we
know will be gone.

17:18.958 --> 17:21.000
I just don't know.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.625
It's all so unreal.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.625
[Man]
Nobody busts up my place.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.375
Moose! Rocco! Get them!

17:31.375 --> 17:33.083
Keep them away from Xavier!

17:33.083 --> 17:34.583
My pleasure.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.458
[grunting]

17:40.958 --> 17:43.083
[all screaming]

17:44.750 --> 17:46.500
It's all so unreal.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.166
We are not here to hurt you.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.208
Bad listening.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.375
-Let's go!
-I ain't done yet!

18:02.375 --> 18:03.750
Yes, you are, Logan.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.458
Hurry,
before you make things worse!

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Professor?

18:08.458 --> 18:09.458
He's gone!

18:10.875 --> 18:13.000
Spread out.
We've got to find him

18:13.000 --> 18:14.458
before Fitzroy does!

18:16.625 --> 18:18.500
You did it again, Logan.

18:18.958 --> 18:22.375
You lost your temper and the man
you were supposed to protect.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.458
I'm sorry, darling.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.750
Thinking about losing you
has made me a little edgy.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.250
I know.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.000
Let's go find Xavier.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Xavier?

18:40.875 --> 18:41.875
Are you all right?

18:42.458 --> 18:43.583
Oh, yes.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.125
-[groans]
-Gotcha!

18:47.083 --> 18:48.083
Nimrod!

18:48.083 --> 18:51.000
So, this is Nimrod.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.583
[grunts]

19:02.416 --> 19:03.416
[screams]

19:04.166 --> 19:07.958
[straining]
No tin can... man

19:07.958 --> 19:09.000
is gonna get...

19:09.958 --> 19:11.875
the best of me!

19:17.458 --> 19:18.875
Crack the heavens!

19:19.333 --> 19:21.833
Remove this abomination!

19:37.875 --> 19:40.458
-Fitzroy.
-Don't shoot!

19:40.458 --> 19:42.208
W-We surrender!

19:42.208 --> 19:43.250
Forget it!

19:45.000 --> 19:46.833
Bantam, come on!

19:53.291 --> 19:55.583
[Bantam]
I hate this...

20:00.250 --> 20:01.708
[groans in frustration]

20:01.708 --> 20:03.208
Soulless monster!

20:06.875 --> 20:09.958
[Xavier]
Such power and destruction!

20:09.958 --> 20:12.583
I'm... I'm not capable

20:12.583 --> 20:14.500
of mastering anything like that!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.250
I can't!

20:22.708 --> 20:24.083
[beeping]

20:24.083 --> 20:25.875
Electronic fuse!

20:32.333 --> 20:34.625
What in the world?

20:37.083 --> 20:39.000
[shrill beep]

20:41.333 --> 20:43.000
No!
