♪ MTV... ♪

00:10.678 --> 00:12.213
<i>Previously on Yellowstone...</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:15.049
So you gave your
girlfriend clemency.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.517
I commuted her sentence.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.387
She's finishing it out
under house arrest.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.956
You have invited your worst
enemy to sleep in your bed, Dad.

00:22.956 --> 00:26.827
Yeah, Summer. Why don't you
and I take a walk?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.198
This is
my fucking house.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.533
You will respect
everybody in it.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.135
What respect to I get?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.970
You get exactly
what you give.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.942
- My cowboy's back.
- You wanna drink
or you wanna dance?

00:41.942 --> 00:43.010
I want both.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.080
The other night was...
it was unprofessional.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.250
If you thought that last night
was unprofessional...

00:49.250 --> 00:52.286
You keep enforcing
the slave rules.

00:52.286 --> 00:56.124
I'm going to teach you
the master rules.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.258
Be gone for a couple days.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.859
Well, can you
outfit me too?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.961
Honey, we're on horseback
for two days.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.764
I am not staying in that
dungeon by myself.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.633
Sure you got
another ride in ya?

01:05.633 --> 01:08.169
I'll race you up
to the top, Governor.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.237
Yee-ha!

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
Guys in the back,
drop in.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.621
And they wonder why
we fight so hard.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.923
You see what you been missing?

02:02.923 --> 02:04.425
Did anyone think
to pack any vodka?

02:04.425 --> 02:08.496
Beth, just...
look at the horizon.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.398
Yeah, I see it, Dad.
It's very pretty.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.035
What, I said it's pretty.
Don't make a thing out of it.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.570
You two drop in here.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.071
I wanna go down a hundred yards

02:18.206 --> 02:19.907
where she can't ruin
this for me.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.742
It's the same view
from the porch.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.010
Just a different angle.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.253
Honey, you got a mean streak
as big as this damn valley.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.922
Well, it's a woman's job
to give a man perspective, baby.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.624
Oh, is that what that was?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.292
- I do not find this beautiful.
- Mm.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.693
Personally.
Okay?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.762
Too big, too much space
to be beautiful.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.063
To comprehend it.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.633
Now, give me a meadow,
and a little lake...

02:45.633 --> 02:47.067
Mm-hm.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.138
A little stream...
no one knows about it but me.

02:51.239 --> 02:56.076
And I have it all to myself.
That I understand.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.480
I don't like to share the things
I find beautiful.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.881
Know what I mean?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.957
Every time I look
at you,

03:09.957 --> 03:11.325
I know exactly what you mean.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.463
Come on.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.917
Wait here.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.759
Are those military?

04:51.759 --> 04:53.361
Yeah.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.464
- What are they doing here?
- Don't know.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.731
Training, maybe.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.001
Why would they
be training there?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.041
Stay in the house.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.419
<i>Mo?</i>

05:51.419 --> 05:53.086
You giving a speech
today, Chairman?

05:53.086 --> 05:54.321
<i>A speech?</i>

05:57.591 --> 05:59.059
This area is closed
for an event.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.528
What event?

06:00.528 --> 06:03.263
Turn your vehicle around
and vacate this area.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.599
I'm a lieutenant
for the Tribal Police

06:05.599 --> 06:07.501
in charge of security
for the Chairman

06:07.501 --> 06:10.003
of the Confederated Nations.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.540
Are you aware of an event?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.207
<i>What event, Mo?</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.243
I don't know.

06:16.243 --> 06:19.447
There can't be any planned
event on Broken Rock land

06:19.447 --> 06:21.782
without the approval
of the Chairman's office.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.218
We got the tribal police
head of security here

06:25.218 --> 06:28.021
saying they weren't aware
of today's event.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.057
Male Supervisor: <i>Tell 'em to
stand by. We'll be there soon.</i>

06:30.057 --> 06:31.358
My supervisor's on his way.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.560
You can pull the car
over here to the side

06:32.560 --> 06:34.027
if you want to wait.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.241
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:48.241 --> 06:49.477
Hey! Stop!

06:49.477 --> 06:50.611
Stray dogs are
a security risk.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.712
They're not strays.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.713
They just wandered
from their home.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.782
That's a stray.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.719
I need to come
and get you, Chairman.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.887
But I'm scared to leave.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.955
They're shooting
all the dogs in town.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.491
<i>I'll drive myself.</i>

07:03.491 --> 07:04.992
I'll send squad cars
to meet you.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.226
<i>Okay.</i>

07:07.661 --> 07:09.497
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.565
Stand down!

07:11.565 --> 07:13.266
Those are people's dogs.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.035
Stop shooting them.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.336
They're pets!

07:16.336 --> 07:18.238
Our orders mandate
that any stray animal

07:18.238 --> 07:19.239
be removed or neutralized.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.509
Then call the animal control!

07:21.509 --> 07:23.644
- Do you have one?
- Of course we have one.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.647
- How far away?
- An hour, maybe.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.549
Well, go ahead and call it.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.686
What's this event?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.522
I have no idea.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.623
Then what are you doing here?

07:35.623 --> 07:37.057
Gee, I don't know.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.527
You got four military
helicopters in the air above you

07:39.527 --> 07:41.995
and secret service
agents blocking the road.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.897
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing here?

07:50.638 --> 07:52.072
<i>What's happening, Mo?</i>

07:52.072 --> 07:55.308
Chairman, I think the
President's coming here.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.277
<i>The president of what?</i>

07:57.277 --> 07:58.979
The United States.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.065
Mmm.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.407
What is that look for?

08:27.407 --> 08:32.012
Trying to figure out
what you're doing here.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.581
You've made
that pretty clear.

08:35.916 --> 08:43.757
I mean, the coincidence
that M.E.'s outside council

08:43.757 --> 08:48.028
keeps finding her way
to the bed of the opposition.

08:58.305 --> 09:02.475
When you insinuate that
I'm here for any reason

09:02.610 --> 09:05.112
other than I want to be here,

09:05.112 --> 09:08.849
you're insinuating
that I would use sex

09:08.849 --> 09:11.885
to achieve a particular
goal within my profession.

09:11.885 --> 09:16.323
Which is to say that I'm being
paid to have sex with you.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.925
Which is to call me a whore.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.126
Is that what you're doing?

09:19.126 --> 09:20.127
Are you calling me
a whore, Jamie?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.528
No, of course not.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.098
Look, I got a...

09:25.098 --> 09:27.635
pretty good bead
on my appeal as a man,

09:27.635 --> 09:30.971
and it doesn't add up to you.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.908
This is so fucking childish.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.479
Are you so insecure that
the only explanation for me

09:39.479 --> 09:43.951
wanting to have sex with you
is anything other than me

09:43.951 --> 09:45.352
just wanting to?

09:48.155 --> 09:52.425
Harvard Law graduate holding
the second most powerful

09:53.360 --> 09:56.797
public office
in the state, hm?

09:56.797 --> 10:00.433
And if you're so sure I have all
of these ulterior motives

10:00.433 --> 10:03.671
then why the hell would
you bring me to your house?

10:03.671 --> 10:05.973
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

10:05.973 --> 10:10.143
Let me ask you this:

10:10.143 --> 10:11.812
Why aren't you Governor?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.984
You clearly have
the skill for it.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.252
You orchestrated the lease
and the build in a manner

10:19.252 --> 10:21.454
that you unraveled
leaving no legal recourse

10:21.454 --> 10:23.924
for the company
you so completely fucked,

10:23.924 --> 10:26.994
it's likely to be bought by
another company within a year.

10:26.994 --> 10:32.900
Your father won on the slogan
"Progress Stops With Me"...

10:36.704 --> 10:40.107
Are there that many pissed off
old white men in Montana?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.243
Apparently.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.278
Here's my ulterior motive.
You wanna hear it?

10:48.949 --> 10:49.983
Get you elected Governor.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.453
Reinstate our lease
and push through our project

10:53.453 --> 10:56.023
with a contract that
you cannot weasel out of,

10:56.023 --> 10:59.592
and save this state from its
policy of hiding its head

10:59.592 --> 11:04.832
in the sand hoping that the rest
of the world will just walk by.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.236
It wasn't my
motive until...

11:15.342 --> 11:18.011
Until I found myself naked
in your house

11:18.011 --> 11:19.646
arguing about why I'm naked
in your house.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.218
I'm going to go take
a shower before I leave.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.620
I gotta get to the office
and try to sell

11:27.755 --> 11:29.757
a hundred metric tons
of fucking concrete

11:29.757 --> 11:31.925
for thirty cents
on the dollar.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.075
I'm gonna be late
for the office, too.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.409
I'll be out in a minute.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.581
We try to conserve
water in this state.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.187
I do not have to fuck you

12:00.187 --> 12:03.623
to give you money
for your campaign.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.658
I'm here because
I want to be here.

12:08.796 --> 12:12.833
Help me win Governor
and I'll give you your airport.

12:14.301 --> 12:18.038
Help me put the brakes
on the fire sale.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.974
Four years is a long time.
It's too long.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.081
Lets find a way
to make it sooner.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.983
Okay.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.737
Mm.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.696
This looks like
quite the feast.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.465
There'll be a
few hundred people here
this time tomorrow.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.168
- For the branding?
- Yeah.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.071
We haven't met.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.007
We sort of met.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.275
I was thinking about
going for a hike.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.244
Can you point me
in a direction?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.412
Not from around here.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.481
Why do you say that?

14:41.481 --> 14:42.950
If you were from around here,

14:42.950 --> 14:44.217
you would've asked
if you could help.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.320
Need help?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.459
These potatoes
don't peel themselves.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.370
Did you put anything
on that cut?

15:03.370 --> 15:04.437
Mm-mm.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.649
It's okay.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.750
Ow, ow.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.152
Yeah, I bet.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.990
She caught me pretty good.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.359
Beth is not first
on my list to fight.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.461
She's got daddy issues
she has to work through.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.365
You know, I really
overturned the apple cart

15:32.365 --> 15:35.035
when it comes to this family.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.571
I'm sure John Dutton had
some little blonde daughter

15:38.571 --> 15:41.441
of a landowner
all picked out,

15:41.441 --> 15:44.211
and then I married
the ranch's heir

15:44.211 --> 15:47.880
and now the heir doesn't
want the ranch anymore.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.117
One could argue
she should hate me.

15:52.019 --> 15:56.056
But she has defended me
over and over...

15:56.056 --> 15:58.025
because she knows
I love her brother,

15:58.025 --> 16:01.661
and I'm no threat to this place.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.233
She sure thinks you are.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.136
That's pretty clear.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.637
Are you?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.640
I don't know.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.209
I'm not really sure what
this place represents.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.579
It doesn't represent anything.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.348
It just is.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.883
I mean, it looks the same
it did a century ago.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.518
The same it did
a thousand years ago.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.956
What does Bozeman represent?
That's the question.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.559
And Portland and Phoenix,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.328
and Los Angeles,
for that matter.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.132
Every city represents
something different.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.768
No, they don't.
They say the same thing.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.708
Every summer there's fire and
every winter there's blizzards.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.844
One cleanses the forest
and one protects it,

16:51.844 --> 16:54.681
then feeds its rivers
in the spring,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.383
which feeds the valley.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.785
But those two same
things happen in the city,

16:58.785 --> 17:00.353
and they're devastating.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.089
Because cities are
the opposite of nature.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.690
They defy it.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.193
Which is why they
always crumble.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.728
These mountains have been
around for eighty million years

17:08.728 --> 17:11.798
and they'll be around
for millions more.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.701
Name the city that
will stand that long.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.940
Hey, and you think you're
the environmentalist.

17:20.940 --> 17:24.777
Everywhere I go,
I get a lecture in this place.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.913
Now you know
what it feels like.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.737
Where's the cattle?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.706
They only hide in the pines

17:53.706 --> 17:55.842
when they're hiding
from the sun.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.444
Sun ain't quite
hot enough yet.

17:59.279 --> 18:03.015
They're never far from water and
they're never far from grass.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.458
There's cattle.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.327
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.695
Yeah.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.963
We're just gonna
walk at 'em, okay?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.265
Just walk right up to them.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.366
If you run at them,
they're gonna run down

18:19.366 --> 18:21.901
that hill and then
the chase is on.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.437
There'll be plenty
of chase soon enough.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.639
I mean, I'm ready
to chase right now.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.775
Yeah. I can see that.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.977
Let's go.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.055
Hey, hey, hey.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.537
Hah, hah, hah, hah!
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.932
Tch-tch-tch...

19:59.932 --> 20:01.000
Hut!

20:06.706 --> 20:09.276
Tch-tch-tch-tch...
Hut, hut!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.282
I'm gonna let 'em graze here.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.250
I'll send some of the boys
across the creek.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.520
And you'll settle in the shade
while the sun's high.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.821
All right, well then find
somewhere up the creek

20:54.821 --> 20:57.590
that we can run a picket line.
- Yes, sir.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.362
I can't believe
you're not smiling.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.031
I'm smiling on the inside.

21:05.031 --> 21:09.035
Don't ever call
this work, okay? Ever.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.405
You bring your fly rod?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.140
Thought you said no fishing.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.008
Yeah, well, I didn't
know we was gonna

21:16.008 --> 21:17.410
get 'em held up so quick.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.078
If we're not careful, John,

21:19.078 --> 21:21.514
people are gonna think
we know what we're doing.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.150
Hey, you, uh...

21:24.150 --> 21:26.052
didn't think to
bring a fly rod, did you?

21:26.052 --> 21:28.621
Of course
I brought my fly rod.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.957
I think my grandson may want
to arm wrestle you for it.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.392
No need.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.926
Tate, come with me.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.195
We're gonna tie these horses up
and take turns.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.864
- All right.
- Come on.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.400
Let's go.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.536
Hey.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.704
Ah.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.138
He needed this.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.441
Yeah, we all needed it, son.

21:50.610 --> 21:54.481
That was fucking awesome.
Sorry, Governor.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.982
Tell us how you really feel.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.917
It was fucking awesome.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.519
Sorry, again.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.654
Wow.
What do we do now?

22:01.654 --> 22:04.691
Well, I'm gonna go find me
a tree and lay down under it

22:04.691 --> 22:06.859
'till it's my turn
to watch the herd.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.194
I'm too excited to nap.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.562
You'll grow out of that.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.897
You get yourself
on the other side of the creek

22:10.897 --> 22:13.299
and make sure these cattle
stay on our side.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.668
All right. Yes, sir.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.710
You could sell it, son.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.446
You could bottle it up
and sell it.

22:27.980 --> 22:31.150
I don't think there's
anyone to sell it to, Dad.

22:31.150 --> 22:34.587
Anyone who knows what it's worth
are already doing it.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.256
Maybe so.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.351
I think I got it
figured out.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.787
So do I.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.062
Chairman, so glad
you could make it.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.231
You have no authority
to authorize anything

23:52.231 --> 23:54.634
on the reservation,

23:54.634 --> 23:57.303
and neither does the council
without my approval.

23:57.303 --> 24:01.107
Hmm.
I disagree with that.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.643
So does our charter.

24:03.643 --> 24:07.013
I don't need your
permission to assemble

24:07.013 --> 24:08.948
and neither does the council.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.617
This isn't assembling.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.520
This is greeting the President
of the United States.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.054
It was last minute.

24:15.054 --> 24:19.291
We weren't certain he could fit
it in, but it worked out.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.827
Thank goodness.

24:20.827 --> 24:25.532
It's important that the people
know we aren't invisible.

24:25.532 --> 24:28.300
Obama visited Standing Rock
two years before he tried

24:28.300 --> 24:30.102
to run a pipeline through it.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.238
Presidents don't see us

24:32.238 --> 24:34.140
even when they are
standing in front of us.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.742
This one will see us.

24:35.742 --> 24:38.745
I'm his Director
of Native American Affairs.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.347
And he's going
to endorse Martin.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.151
Let him.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.555
If he gave me his endorsement,
I'd give it back.

24:50.557 --> 24:56.062
Well, it's a good thing
you only have one vote, Tom.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.639
Won't be long now.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.575
Better get to our seats.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.914
What do you want to do?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.617
No choice.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.151
I'm going to sit
up on that stage

25:19.151 --> 25:20.687
and let them throw mud at me.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.356
My absence would say
more than their insults.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.058
Come on, Mo.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.875
It's a big day
for the people.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.877
It's just another day
for the people.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.412
The big day is for you.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.140
Who's this?

26:14.140 --> 26:15.374
Don't know.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.810
The first one, I think.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.220
The family's
been here that long.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.391
And it was my family's
before it was theirs.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.197
Yeah.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.782
My son.

27:00.687 --> 27:04.190
When I say we give everything
to this land,

27:04.190 --> 27:06.025
I do mean everything.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.797
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be here.

27:16.435 --> 27:20.606
If your goal is knowing
John Dutton, then...

27:20.707 --> 27:22.541
this is exactly
where you should be.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.058
Sweetheart?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.001
Wow. I never sleep
during the day.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.773
I've slept through a few,
but I don't nap.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.778
Come on. I got something
I wanna show you.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.583
Jump on your horse.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.832
Is this more your kind
of beautiful?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.855
I found it a year ago

29:48.855 --> 29:50.923
when you said you wanted to be
married in a place

29:50.923 --> 29:53.725
with no memories
'til we made 'em.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.332
Yeah, I kinda rushed
the wedding, didn't I?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.902
- I'm sorry, baby.
- Yep.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.238
In my defense, I thought
I was gonna

30:06.238 --> 30:08.440
spend the rest of
my life in prison, so...

30:09.675 --> 30:11.510
Kind of had to put the pedal
to the metal.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.008
Fuck!
You're a good man.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.302
Mm. Thank you.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.980
All I need now is a cigarette.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.220
You know, I'm blowing you
anyway, baby.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.057
You don't have to work
so fucking hard.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.525
Here.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.561
You're a perfect motherfucker.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.238
I could do this.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.540
I could live here.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.978
Never see another person
in my whole life except you.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.047
Yeah, well, it might be
a little tricky

31:55.047 --> 31:56.182
in the winter, sweetheart.

31:56.182 --> 31:59.085
No. You know what I mean.

31:59.085 --> 32:02.488
I mean I don't need
anything else.
- Mm.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.993
Cigarettes, whiskey,

32:06.993 --> 32:09.996
a meadow, and you.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.231
Darling, you have a warped
sense of priorities,

32:12.231 --> 32:13.232
I'll tell you.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.733
No, I don't.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.537
Three things that make me
feel good in the perfect meadow.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.142
I don't need anything else.
Do you?

32:23.142 --> 32:24.476
Mm--

32:24.476 --> 32:26.512
All right, you can
have a horse.

32:26.512 --> 32:29.215
Well, I need cows to chase or
there's no reason to ride him.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.216
Fine, you can have
a couple of cows.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.550
Okay, then thank you.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.085
Now you're gonna
need someplace

32:33.085 --> 32:36.222
to chase 'em to, right?
- Mm-hm.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.157
You're gonna make me
build a barn

32:38.157 --> 32:40.359
in my perfect meadow.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.161
- Beth--
- No. You know...

32:42.161 --> 32:44.730
Stop applying logic to my
perfect daydream please.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.365
Beth, shut the fuck up.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.703
Shut the fuck up
and watch that sunset with me.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.072
- Shut the fuck up?
- Mm-hmm.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.374
"Shut the fuck up," he says
to his wife.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.309
Not "shut up."
Shut "the fuck" up.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.544
You know what?

33:04.616 --> 33:05.917
Fuck your sunset, baby.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.225
You watch me.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.462
Sunsets are overrated anyway.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.154
How'd you truck
a blanket up here?

33:42.154 --> 33:45.924
I traded out my slicker.

33:46.858 --> 33:51.497
And gambled it wouldn't rain.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.631
Gambled right.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.905
You know, I've come
to believe perfection

33:59.905 --> 34:03.275
only lives in little moments.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.977
You know?
Can't be sustained over hours.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.715
Just instances, you know?
Little wisps of time.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.552
Then the world
becomes imperfect again.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.590
This day damn near
proved me wrong.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.961
Well, John,
if it wasn't perfect,

34:22.961 --> 34:24.930
it was damn close.

34:27.499 --> 34:31.437
Yeah. Damn close, indeed.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.140
The Governor of Montana
on the side of a mountain

34:34.140 --> 34:36.175
sleeping with his boots on.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.148
This world may
have a chance yet.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.621
You keep your head up on
that saddle, you old bastard.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.623
I don't need to
listen to you--

34:58.997 --> 35:01.567
You know, my dad used to say
if you can't sleep

35:01.567 --> 35:06.538
through a man's snoring...
you ain't tired enough.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.943
I guess we'll see.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.622
Hey buddy.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.390
Hey. Get your boots on.

36:16.275 --> 36:19.077
I don't mind working
for less than minimum wage,

36:19.077 --> 36:21.680
but these mornings with
no-coffee bullshit...

36:21.680 --> 36:23.449
It's cowboy shit.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.351
Hell, it'll just make it taste
that much better

36:25.351 --> 36:27.085
once you get down
the hill, Ryan.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.420
There you go, Ryan.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.522
Drink up a little bit
of that cowboy wisdom.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.393
Come on, you old bastard.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.712
Well, Emmett, I couldn't...

37:28.514 --> 37:30.316
Couldn't have dreamed up
a better death if you paid me.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.087
You sure earned it, old friend.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.566
We're gonna need that satellite
phone after all.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.904
Oh, my God.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.741
Yeah. Life ends,
that's part of it.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.609
His ended good.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.878
I refuse to be sad about it.
You should, too.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.847
All right.

38:11.156 --> 38:12.824
Get 'em going.
We'll catch up.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.227
What happened, sir?

38:18.697 --> 38:19.731
He didn't wake up.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.934
He just...
died on the trail...

38:25.437 --> 38:27.373
Like every cowboy dreams it.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.662
Let's keep moving!
Let's go!

38:52.664 --> 38:55.501
I'll send you GPS coordinates.
Yeah, it's level ground.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.236
The clearing is about
three hundred yards across.

Which part?

39:52.257 --> 39:54.159
"They're almost
back to me" part.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.530
There they are.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.196
Mount up.
We gotta hurry.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.464
Why hurry?

40:32.464 --> 40:33.899
'Cause I can't have
Emmett's wife

40:33.899 --> 40:36.502
watch the herd ride in
without him and no answers.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.304
If I go too fast,
you just take your time.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.106
I don't know

55:37.602 --> 55:40.070
<i>Pat Jennings has the answer.</i>

55:40.070 --> 55:43.107
<i>For 139 years,
Yellowstone Ranch cattle</i>

55:43.107 --> 55:44.642
<i>have grazed these mountains</i>

55:44.642 --> 55:47.277
<i>then gathered and brought here,
for the annual branding</i>

55:47.412 --> 55:50.615
<i>but one of the cowboys on this
drive will not be coming home.</i>

55:50.615 --> 55:53.584
<i>Local rancher and former
Head of Montana Fish and Game</i>

55:53.584 --> 55:56.521
<i>died in his sleep last night,
somewhere in those mountains.</i>

55:56.521 --> 55:58.423
<i>His wife was waiting
for his return</i>

55:58.423 --> 56:01.492
<i>only to be told by our governor
that he will not be returning.</i>

56:01.492 --> 56:03.528
<i>One cowboy took his last ride,</i>

56:03.528 --> 56:05.730
<i>while another delivered
the grim news</i>

56:05.730 --> 56:09.800
<i>and offered all he had to
offer: a shoulder to cry on.</i>

56:09.800 --> 56:11.436
<i>Jane?</i>

56:11.436 --> 56:14.572
<i>Well, some might question
the governor's priorities,</i>

56:14.572 --> 56:16.173
<i>but not this news anchor.</i>

56:16.173 --> 56:18.142
<i>This news anchor
believes our governor</i>

56:18.142 --> 56:19.710
<i>is right where he belongs.</i>

56:19.710 --> 56:22.447
I swear, the man could
fall in a pile of cow shit

56:22.447 --> 56:25.149
and come up smelling
like a rose.

56:25.149 --> 56:28.553
I admit, he's hard
to beat in a fair fight.

56:30.054 --> 56:33.023
I don't think we can let him
show up to the fight, Jamie.

56:52.342 --> 56:54.111
<i>Next time on Yellowstone...</i>

56:54.111 --> 56:56.614
This is my favorite part.

56:56.614 --> 56:59.049
Of everything we do,
this is my favorite.

57:00.250 --> 57:02.553
Found something
you might want to see.

57:02.553 --> 57:04.789
Your business plan, that's
gonna be the end of us, Dad.

57:04.789 --> 57:07.758
The future of the cattle
industry is no future.

57:07.758 --> 57:12.096
Your state will be on the hook
for around four billion dollars.

57:12.096 --> 57:15.566
Sounds like an impeachable
offense to me.

57:15.566 --> 57:17.067
Yes it does.
