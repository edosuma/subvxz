00:02.200 --> 00:03.999
This is awkward.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.919
The cute, smiley, popular girl.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.079
I think she murdered me.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.599
So, you think that
if a girl likes me,

00:09.600 --> 00:11.319
there must be something
wrong with her.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.239
That's not what we're saying.
Dad!

00:13.240 --> 00:17.239
She's my little...

00:17.800 --> 00:19.639
Why are the coppers after you?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.119
I didn't mean to hurt them.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.439
I didn't mean to hurt anyone,
especially not you.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.799
What are you doing?

00:24.800 --> 00:28.799
Bruno!

00:29.880 --> 00:33.879
You killed him!

01:37.360 --> 01:41.359
# TCHAIKOVSKY:
Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy

02:53.400 --> 02:55.719
How would you describe your ability?

02:55.720 --> 02:58.359
I call it lacto-kinesis.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.359
What's it like being called
the world's first superhero?

03:03.080 --> 03:07.079
That has to be
the shittest power ever.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.839
# The city breathing

03:21.840 --> 03:23.639
# The people churning

03:23.640 --> 03:24.919
# The conversating

03:24.920 --> 03:28.919
# The price is what?

03:41.560 --> 03:42.759
# The conversating

03:42.760 --> 03:45.159
# This place is heaven

03:45.160 --> 03:49.159
# If you see them! #

03:53.280 --> 03:57.159
Hey, man.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.719
I can't believe
this guy has gone public.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.959
You better believe it.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.959
Because he's going to
make a fortune.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.799
Maybe we should think
about doing the same?

04:04.800 --> 04:08.799
The early bird catches
the massive pay cheque.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.279
Nice cock, man.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.759
Fuck off.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.879
I don't think going public's
a good idea.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.478
Look, we finish our community
service in two days. Count them.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.119
I don't know about you,
but I'm not exactly swamped

04:20.120 --> 04:22.359
with lucrative job offers.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.359
We need to think about
cashing in on our powers.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.279
I mean, I'm immortal.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.279
I shouldn't be flipping burgers,
I should be eating burgers,

04:39.640 --> 04:41.959
massive burgers,
the size of my head.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.399
Think about it, we could have
really cool superhero names.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.639
Captain Invincible.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.119
Mr Backwards.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.999
I sound retarded.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.159
The Invisible Cunt.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.279
Why do I have to be
the Invisible Cunt?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.599
Because you just are, man.
Get over it.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.639
I mean, what's the point in
all of us having superpowers

05:02.640 --> 05:05.359
if we can't use them
to make obscene amounts of money

05:05.360 --> 05:07.999
and shag loads of drunk,
impressionable girls.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.999
It's clearly what God intended for
us. I for one will not let him down.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.359
Simon!
What?

05:23.360 --> 05:26.079
What's going on
with you and Jessica?

05:26.080 --> 05:30.079
After what happened with her dad,
she said she can't see me, so...

05:30.240 --> 05:32.599
Seeing a girl
whose dad tried to kill you...

05:32.600 --> 05:34.999
it's never going to work.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.039
You'll meet someone else.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.039
Trust me.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.679
What was that?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.279
They know what about us.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.839
Who?

06:01.840 --> 06:03.199
Everyone.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.439
What are you talking about?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.639
There are reporters and
TV cameras outside, lots of them.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.079
Bullshit.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.239
No way.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.559
Are you serious?

06:12.560 --> 06:14.999
Right. I think
I might take a little peek.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.839
Don't open the door.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.519
That was really
quite a lot of reporters.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.239
How did they find out about us?

06:33.240 --> 06:37.239
What? No, I didn't do anything.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.199
I don't think I did.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.199
I'm almost certain I didn't.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.239
You!

06:49.640 --> 06:52.159
You told them about us.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.159
Yeah.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.159
You sit on your arse
doing nothing for six weeks

06:56.160 --> 06:57.199
and then you sell us out.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.679
Looks like that, doesn't it?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.639
Is that ironic?

07:01.640 --> 07:03.119
Never too sure.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.959
You're our probation worker.
You're supposed to sort us out.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.759
I'm sure you'll be fine.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.639
Like you give a shit.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.239
That's a good point. See you.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.919
Where you going?

07:13.920 --> 07:16.279
Antigua. Hm.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.279
So, this is goodbye,
so long, and fuck off.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.479
Wanker!

07:25.120 --> 07:29.119
I'm actually very surprised
that it hasn't happened sooner.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.599
We haven't really been that careful.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.479
What are they going to do to us?

07:34.480 --> 07:36.039
They'll treat us like freaks.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.479
They'll lock us up
in a secret military facility

07:39.480 --> 07:40.919
and conduct experiments on us.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.159
Hey, no-one's experimenting on me.
I'm not a monkey.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.439
What are we going to do?

07:46.440 --> 07:48.519
We have to go into hiding.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.559
We assume new identities.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.759
We break off all connection
with our family and friends.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.359
We wear disguises
and only go out after dark.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.879
I'm not loving the sound of that.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.279
Do you expect me
never to see my mum again?

08:01.280 --> 08:04.079
Who's going to do my washing? Huh?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.439
You have not thought this through.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.239
There is an alternative.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.039
Who are you?

08:12.040 --> 08:15.519
I'm the person who can make it
so you don't need to go into hiding.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.519
If this is handled right,
you're all making some serious money.

08:28.040 --> 08:32.039
What are you thinking?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.799
This isn't why we got our powers.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.239
No. There is no why,
there's only what.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.078
What are we going to
spend all our money on?

08:40.080 --> 08:42.119
None of us even know
what we're doing after.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.239
It's better than signing on.
What about the people we killed?

08:47.520 --> 08:53.359
I guess we should ask her
about that. -Yeah.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.679
I'm not saying we have,

09:00.680 --> 09:03.719
but what would happen,
hypothetically speaking,

09:03.720 --> 09:07.719
if it came to light that we may
have killed one or two people?

09:09.360 --> 09:13.359
Probation workers and such.
No-one important.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.999
I would say that these people

09:20.000 --> 09:21.959
you may or may not have killed

09:21.960 --> 09:25.079
were evil.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.639
You were protecting society.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.639
You're not murderers.
You're heroes.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.559
Superheroes.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.559
Rich, famous superheroes.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.519
And if that doesn't work,

09:38.520 --> 09:41.359
we vanish the bodies
and pay off the relatives.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.879
Good answer.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.999
Sign us up.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.479
Good.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.039
We're making a mistake.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.199
We should all stick together.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.479
Just do it with us.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.479
This will change everything.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.279
Call me when you change your mind.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.199
I don't know.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.719
Do you trust her?

10:17.720 --> 10:19.319
They're waiting for you.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.279
They're calling you the ASBO Five.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.999
I haven't even got an ASBO.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.439
No-one cares.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.799
OK, any questions you don't want
to answer, just let me handle it.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.559
Teeth, good.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.199
Hair, beautiful.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.839
Cock, in.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.239
Flies, up.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.239
Let's go be famous.

11:09.346 --> 11:13.345
Hello, ladies!

11:18.226 --> 11:22.225
Phew!

11:25.026 --> 11:27.425
Laura, hi.

11:27.426 --> 11:30.665
Have we heard anything from the
French about this cheese deal?

11:30.666 --> 11:32.305
Do they know what I can do?

11:32.306 --> 11:35.705
They know. They're calling
you Monsieur Grande Fromage.

11:35.706 --> 11:36.985
Mr Big Cheese.

11:38.186 --> 11:40.785
Can we do this later?
I'm really busy right now.

11:40.786 --> 11:42.345
Have you got it?

11:42.346 --> 11:46.345
Take her straight to the hotel
and don't let her talk to anyone.

11:46.746 --> 11:49.505
How wonderful.
No, we're very excited.

12:07.506 --> 12:11.505
Ah!

12:13.586 --> 12:15.585
Jesus!

12:15.586 --> 12:17.305
Sorry.

12:17.306 --> 12:19.945
Why are you skulking
around in my bathroom?

12:19.946 --> 12:22.825
My parents are freaking out
about the invisible thing.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.945
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

12:24.946 --> 12:27.545
Can I stay with you?

12:27.546 --> 12:29.745
Sure, man.

12:29.746 --> 12:32.585
Hang back a few minutes, though.
I'm just going to go

12:32.586 --> 12:36.585
slip these girls one before
they sober up.

12:43.706 --> 12:44.865
Sorry I'm late.

12:44.866 --> 12:48.425
I was just enjoying the fruits of
our new-found fame and celebrity.

12:48.426 --> 12:51.425
You know I'm not actually
talking about fruit.

12:51.426 --> 12:54.865
Although you should see the
size of my fruit bowl... Massive!

12:54.866 --> 12:56.905
Did you shag those skanky girls?

12:56.906 --> 12:58.745
I most certainly did.

12:58.746 --> 13:00.745
Loving the canapes.

13:00.746 --> 13:03.785
I was just saying, if there's
anything you don't want to see

13:03.786 --> 13:07.465
in the papers, tell me now
and then I can deal with it.

13:07.466 --> 13:10.265
Everything about me has
already been in the papers.

13:10.266 --> 13:12.145
Do any of your
ex-boyfriends have

13:12.146 --> 13:14.385
any intimate photographs
or videos of you?

13:14.386 --> 13:17.065
I'll delete them.

13:17.066 --> 13:19.105
Make sure you do.

13:19.106 --> 13:22.585
Right. Is there anything
else I need to know?

13:22.586 --> 13:26.105
Yes?

13:26.106 --> 13:29.745
Just before I started
my Community Service,

13:29.746 --> 13:33.625
- there was an incident with this girl...
- What kind of incident?

13:33.626 --> 13:34.785
Really?

13:34.786 --> 13:37.425
I picked her up in this
dentist's waiting room.

13:37.426 --> 13:39.145
She was having
some kind of oral surgery.

13:39.146 --> 13:42.745
So we go out -
a few drinks, a couple of kebabs,

13:42.746 --> 13:46.265
then it's straight back to her place
and start with the shagging.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.825
I've built up a nice rhythm...

13:47.826 --> 13:50.265
I'm getting really close
to blowing my load,

13:50.266 --> 13:52.225
just hovering in the pleasure zone.

13:52.226 --> 13:54.745
And then BAM! All hell breaks lose.

13:54.746 --> 13:58.345
I tripled myself.

13:58.346 --> 14:01.145
I'm not familiar with that term.

14:01.146 --> 14:02.745
You know... Tripling.

14:02.746 --> 14:06.225
It's when you cum, puke and shit
yourself all at the same time.

14:06.226 --> 14:07.705
Fuck's sake!

14:07.706 --> 14:11.705
Three bodily functions.
Doing the triple.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.745
You're telling me that's
never happened to you?

14:13.746 --> 14:16.065
No.

14:16.066 --> 14:19.066
Anyway, I lied about my name,
so she probably doesn't even remember me.

14:19.186 --> 14:21.228
I don't think she's ever forgetting you.

14:23.146 --> 14:26.345
Anyone else?

14:26.346 --> 14:30.345
I shagged a monkey.

14:31.786 --> 14:35.785
Technically, it was a gorilla.

14:50.466 --> 14:51.705
What are we doing here?

14:51.706 --> 14:55.185
I wanted you to meet my other clients
and also some potential sponsors.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.905
Just relax and enjoy yourself.

14:58.906 --> 15:02.905
I should mingle.

15:03.226 --> 15:07.065
Laura.

15:08.786 --> 15:12.785
Down the wrong way.

15:14.866 --> 15:17.625
Hi.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.985
Good to see you.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.065
Oh, you're that milk guy, innit.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.545
It's not just milk.
It's all dairy products.

15:23.546 --> 15:26.345
So you're here to
make the coffees then?

15:26.346 --> 15:29.665
I'm done making other people coffee.
People make my coffee now.

15:29.666 --> 15:32.705
So what's the point
in having your power?

15:32.706 --> 15:36.065
Were you one of those fat kids
who had milk seeping out

15:36.066 --> 15:38.265
of his man boobs during puberty?

15:38.266 --> 15:39.745
No.

15:39.746 --> 15:43.745
We had a kid like him at our school.
We used to milk him every lunchtime.

15:43.906 --> 15:46.345
I wasn't one of those kids.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.385
Get off me - what are you doing?
I'm milking you!

15:48.386 --> 15:49.425
Get off!

15:49.426 --> 15:52.425
This reminds me of school.
That was some good times.

15:52.426 --> 15:56.185
Fuck off!

15:56.186 --> 16:00.185
That's what the kid at my school used
to say and he had a nervous breakdown.

16:04.346 --> 16:05.545
Nathan.

16:05.546 --> 16:08.625
How would you feel about
blowing your brains out

16:08.626 --> 16:12.625
live on national television
tomorrow night?

16:15.586 --> 16:19.585
Yeah, I am definitely up for that.

16:20.066 --> 16:24.065
Another please.

16:30.066 --> 16:31.666
Hi.

16:37.426 --> 16:40.145
Be nice to him, yeah?

16:41.466 --> 16:45.465
I'm not promising anything,
but I'll definitely try.

16:46.066 --> 16:47.945
Maybe a tuxedo - what do you think?

16:47.946 --> 16:51.225
Why not? They're planning to
film it at the Community Centre.

16:51.226 --> 16:54.705
Right. It's like a whole
going back to my roots kind of vibe.

16:54.706 --> 16:55.345
Daisy! Daisy!

16:55.346 --> 16:59.345
Excuse me.

17:04.185 --> 17:04.905
Who's she?

17:04.906 --> 17:06.065
That's Daisy.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.744
More and more people with
powers are coming forward.

17:08.746 --> 17:10.145
What can she do?

17:10.146 --> 17:12.865
She can heal people -
any illness, any disease,

17:12.866 --> 17:15.224
she plans to cure the world.

17:15.226 --> 17:19.224
She's like a pretty, modern day
Mother Theresa with a superpower.

17:19.306 --> 17:22.505
She is going to make a fortune.

17:22.506 --> 17:25.224
Daisy! Daisy!

17:25.226 --> 17:26.065
That's far enough...

17:26.066 --> 17:30.065
No, no, let him through.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.985
What's your name?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.625
Neil.

17:35.626 --> 17:39.625
I'm just going to
touch your legs, OK?

17:47.826 --> 17:51.825
Steady!

18:06.946 --> 18:10.945
I'm walking.

18:16.226 --> 18:20.225
Thank you.

18:43.346 --> 18:47.345
Hi, honey.

18:50.386 --> 18:51.825
Where are you going?

18:51.826 --> 18:54.505
There's somewhere I need to be.

18:54.506 --> 18:57.865
I thought you liked me.

18:57.866 --> 18:59.945
Well...

18:59.946 --> 19:03.865
So now there are other people with
powers you're not interested in me?

19:03.866 --> 19:06.505
There's a guy downstairs
who can rewind time.

19:06.506 --> 19:10.505
You can do stuff with milk.

19:12.786 --> 19:16.785
I'll show you what I can do.

19:22.946 --> 19:25.025
What are you doing?
What is that?

19:25.026 --> 19:28.265
That's the Greek yoghurt
you ate earlier.

19:28.266 --> 19:32.265
It's moving up into your trachea.

19:43.386 --> 19:47.385
You think I'm a nobody.

19:52.186 --> 19:56.185
You're nothing.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.625
Oh Jesus, no!

20:24.626 --> 20:27.545
There's puss seeping out of my cock.

20:27.546 --> 20:28.785
Ugh!

20:28.786 --> 20:32.145
One of those three girls, or the girl
I shagged in the toilets at the club,

20:32.146 --> 20:34.345
one of them had
poor personal hygiene.

20:34.346 --> 20:37.225
This is a catastrophe of
tsunami-like proportions.

20:37.226 --> 20:41.225
No girl in her right mind is
going to have sex with that.

20:41.426 --> 20:44.385
You should ask that
Daisy girl to cure you.

20:44.386 --> 20:46.185
Right.

20:46.186 --> 20:49.825
She wants to cure the world,
she can start with my cock.

20:49.826 --> 20:53.505
'We'd just found that other boy's
body stuffed in the locker and then

20:53.506 --> 20:55.745
'Curtis grabbed my hand
and he's all like,

20:55.746 --> 20:57.705
' "Oh, I wanna bone you,
I wanna shag you senseless." '

20:57.706 --> 20:59.625
'This was just the beginning.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.505
'The five young offenders
soon found that

21:01.506 --> 21:03.505
'each of them had been
affected by the storm.

21:03.506 --> 21:05.305
'Afraid they would be
outcast from society,

21:05.306 --> 21:06.345
'they swore a pact of secrecy...'

21:06.346 --> 21:10.345
'they swore a pact of secrecy...'

21:10.626 --> 21:12.545
Oh, for...

21:12.546 --> 21:14.385
Hi.

21:14.386 --> 21:15.945
Hi. Come in.

21:15.946 --> 21:19.745
Right.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.825
It's Nathan, right?

21:21.826 --> 21:25.825
Right. I just wanted to swing by and
say hi, as one superhero to another.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.665
That's really sweet of you.

21:29.666 --> 21:32.785
So, how mad is all this?

21:32.786 --> 21:36.785
Totally mad. And look at you,
with your wonderful, amazing power.

21:37.626 --> 21:39.505
I saw what you did with
the guy in the wheelchair.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.505
That's like curing two
normal people. Double points.

21:49.826 --> 21:53.825
And so...I was wondering...
if you could maybe help me out

21:54.186 --> 21:56.625
with a small, personal
affliction of my own.

21:56.626 --> 21:58.305
Of course.

21:58.306 --> 22:00.025
What is it?

22:00.026 --> 22:01.545
Well...

22:01.546 --> 22:04.145
I appear to have contracted
a sexually transmitted

22:04.146 --> 22:07.025
disease of some kind.
I honestly don't know how I got it.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.105
I'm sorry. I don't do
sexually transmitted diseases.

22:10.106 --> 22:11.545
No?

22:11.546 --> 22:13.745
Because of the rubbing.

22:13.746 --> 22:16.585
Go to the doctors. They'll
give you some antibiotics.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.425
And how long will that take to work?

22:18.426 --> 22:22.025
Out there, there are loads of
drunken girls, staggering around,

22:22.026 --> 22:25.545
waiting to be shagged. Do you
really want to disappoint them?

22:25.546 --> 22:29.305
I'm sorry. I'm just not
prepared to spend my life

22:29.306 --> 22:30.945
rubbing other people's genitalia.

22:30.946 --> 22:33.025
C'mon. Just give it a quick rub.

22:33.026 --> 22:35.425
It's lovely and clean.
It's pine forest fresh.

22:35.426 --> 22:37.665
I'm not going to rub your cock.

22:37.666 --> 22:41.625
Where's your humanity?

22:41.626 --> 22:43.385
It's not going happen.

22:43.386 --> 22:46.105
OK?

22:46.106 --> 22:49.785
No. That's fair enough.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.425
I suppose have only myself

22:51.426 --> 22:55.425
and the dirty bitch
I had sex with to blame.

22:59.906 --> 23:01.865
What's that?

23:01.866 --> 23:05.865
That's my Mother Theresa, Young
Humanitarian of the Year Award.

23:07.626 --> 23:10.825
It's for the charity
work I did in India.

23:10.826 --> 23:14.585
Good for you,
and good for Mamma Theresa.

23:14.586 --> 23:16.625
God rest her beautiful soul.

23:16.626 --> 23:19.505
Myself next year myself.

23:19.506 --> 23:20.625
Gotcha!

23:20.626 --> 23:21.905
Urgh!

23:21.906 --> 23:23.785
Get off!

23:24.626 --> 23:27.585
Oh!

23:29.746 --> 23:33.265
Fuck, what have I done?

23:33.266 --> 23:34.785
Hey...look...just...

23:34.786 --> 23:36.945
heal yourself! All right?

23:36.946 --> 23:38.465
Heal yourself. That's it.

23:38.466 --> 23:42.465
Rub it better, now, rub it better.

23:45.106 --> 23:46.745
What did you do?

23:46.746 --> 23:48.785
It was an accident.

23:48.786 --> 23:50.545
She was rubbing my cock.

23:50.546 --> 23:54.505
She started foaming at the mouth,
she tripped, and impaled herself

23:54.506 --> 23:58.505
on her Mother Theresa, Young
Humanitarian of the Year Award.

23:58.706 --> 24:00.945
I know it sounds unlikely...

24:00.946 --> 24:04.945
But there it is.

24:07.771 --> 24:11.170
The police are going to
want to interview you again,

24:11.171 --> 24:15.170
but they seem to be satisfied
that Daisy's death was an accident.

24:15.291 --> 24:20.330
Oh! Thank you!

24:21.851 --> 24:23.570
I just want to say...

24:23.571 --> 24:25.210
it's a tragedy.

24:25.211 --> 24:29.210
And no-one is more upset
about this than me.

24:29.411 --> 24:31.290
But what's done, is done.

24:31.291 --> 24:35.290
I think we should all move on, huh?
Stronger, fitter, wiser.

24:36.771 --> 24:38.810
This could only happen to you.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.970
She was going to cure the world.

24:40.971 --> 24:43.450
There's only so many times
I can say I'm sorry!

24:43.451 --> 24:47.450
And if you're so cut up about it,
why don't you...

24:47.851 --> 24:50.930
..And fix this entire situation?
You know it doesn't work like that!

24:50.931 --> 24:54.890
- I'm getting pretty sick
of hearing that! - Prick!

24:54.891 --> 24:58.890
You fuck up like this again,
and I will finish you.

25:00.091 --> 25:04.090
I'll try not to.

25:20.211 --> 25:23.410
I'll tell you something, though.

25:23.411 --> 25:25.050
It's all cleared up.

25:25.051 --> 25:26.970
You know... Down there.

25:26.971 --> 25:30.050
As clean as a new pin.

25:34.331 --> 25:38.330
If you're still in hiding, you should
probably do your invisible thing.

25:43.611 --> 25:47.610
Oh, hey!

25:52.251 --> 25:53.690
You're alone?

25:53.691 --> 25:57.690
Uh-huh. So are you all right then?

25:59.931 --> 26:03.930
I thought I'd feel
like we'd made it.

26:04.451 --> 26:08.290
You know, all this fame stuff.
It just...

26:08.291 --> 26:10.650
feels a bit... pointless.

26:10.651 --> 26:11.810
Of course it's pointless.

26:11.811 --> 26:15.810
That's why famous people pretend
to care about the Africans.

26:16.371 --> 26:19.610
- He knew it would be like this.
- Who?

26:19.611 --> 26:21.490
Simon.

26:21.491 --> 26:25.050
We should've listened to him.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.090
Do you know where he is?

26:27.091 --> 26:31.090
No. No, I haven't seen him.

26:31.931 --> 26:35.530
Nuts?

26:35.531 --> 26:39.330
He said picking up litter
was the best time of his life.

26:39.331 --> 26:43.330
I think that demonstrates
his rather low expectations.

26:45.091 --> 26:49.090
If you see him,
tell him he was right.

26:50.851 --> 26:54.850
Cheerio.

27:00.011 --> 27:03.890
What's up with you?

27:03.891 --> 27:07.890
I never said that,
about picking up litter.

28:44.851 --> 28:48.850
When was that taken?

28:52.771 --> 28:54.490
Where did you get that?

28:54.491 --> 28:56.850
Someone gave it to me.

28:56.851 --> 29:00.850
Who?

29:03.931 --> 29:06.010
What is this place?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.890
The guy in the mask...

29:08.891 --> 29:12.890
He lived here.

29:24.851 --> 29:28.850
Who is he?

29:30.651 --> 29:34.650
It's you.

30:02.851 --> 30:06.850
You came back, so that we could
be together in the future.

30:10.931 --> 30:13.010
You...

30:13.011 --> 30:14.250
And me...

30:14.251 --> 30:15.890
We're together?

30:15.891 --> 30:19.890
Yeah, we were,
and we will be again...

30:21.371 --> 30:25.370
I hope we will be.

30:27.091 --> 30:30.530
You think you're surprised?
Imagine being me!

30:30.531 --> 30:34.530
You're still you,
but you're different.

30:35.131 --> 30:38.690
You're more confident, and...

30:38.691 --> 30:42.130
My power doesn't work on you.

30:42.131 --> 30:46.130
You can touch me.

30:50.211 --> 30:51.730
And then I die?

30:51.731 --> 30:54.690
You saved my life.

30:54.691 --> 30:58.650
You said
if you didn't come back and die,

30:58.651 --> 31:01.210
you wouldn't become
the person you needed to be.

31:01.211 --> 31:05.090
It's like in Terminator, when John
Connor sends Kyle Reece back in time

31:05.091 --> 31:08.170
so that he can be his father.

31:08.171 --> 31:12.170
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

31:14.971 --> 31:18.170
You protected us.

31:18.171 --> 31:22.170
You're like a proper superhero.

31:24.731 --> 31:28.730
When do I turn into this superhero?

31:33.291 --> 31:36.730
So what happens now?

31:36.731 --> 31:40.730
I have no fucking idea.

31:52.011 --> 31:56.010
I don't understand.

31:56.531 --> 31:59.330
Since this whole thing
with the storm went public,

31:59.331 --> 32:01.810
I've been taking
on new clients all the time.

32:01.811 --> 32:05.170
The truth is, I don't have time
to represent you any more.

32:05.171 --> 32:08.210
I'm sorry.

32:08.211 --> 32:12.210
# DELIBES: The Flower Duet

32:19.491 --> 32:23.490
What are you doing?

32:30.971 --> 32:32.970
That's the cheese you had earlier,

32:32.971 --> 32:36.970
slowly clogging your arteries...

33:02.051 --> 33:06.050
OK, stand by for rehearsals, please.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.090
If blowing my brains out
live on national television

33:28.091 --> 33:29.730
doesn't get the ladies juiced,

33:29.731 --> 33:33.210
nothing will.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.170
How do I look?

33:35.171 --> 33:36.810
Like a prick in a suit.

33:36.811 --> 33:39.850
That's sexual jealousy,
because of my prowess as a lover.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.210
Is it true
you shit yourself when you die?

33:42.211 --> 33:43.770
That only happened the once.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.770
And I've got a bucket standing by,
just in case.

33:46.771 --> 33:49.010
Do you want that?
Just lost my appetite...

33:49.011 --> 33:51.730
No, I'm lactose intolerant.

33:51.731 --> 33:53.410
Does that mean you're afraid of cows?

33:53.411 --> 33:55.890
No. It means I don't eat
cheese or dairy products.

33:55.891 --> 33:59.890
Oh. I never knew that about you.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.690
Are you all right?

34:02.691 --> 34:04.290
Yeah.

34:04.291 --> 34:06.250
We'll talk later, yeah?

34:06.251 --> 34:09.690
Have I got time to go to the toilet
before you shoot yourself?

34:09.690 --> 34:13.530
A piss, yes. A shit, probably not.

34:13.531 --> 34:17.530
I'll come with you.

34:33.811 --> 34:35.889
Oh, gross!

34:35.891 --> 34:37.370
What's that?

34:37.371 --> 34:41.370
There's something dripping
from the ceiling. I dunno what...

34:41.650 --> 34:45.650
Kelly?

34:48.451 --> 34:49.489
Kelly?

34:49.491 --> 34:52.210
Quit dicking around.

35:13.131 --> 35:16.530
Ah! Christ!

35:16.531 --> 35:17.570
Sorry, man!

35:17.571 --> 35:21.570
What fucking prick did that?

35:22.051 --> 35:24.690
This guy really is
the most unbelievable tool.

35:24.691 --> 35:25.890
I told you.

35:27.851 --> 35:28.890
Roll titles.

35:28.891 --> 35:32.890
Live in 20.

35:46.531 --> 35:50.530
Going live in five, four, three...

35:54.971 --> 35:57.210
And now, for your viewing pleasure,

35:57.211 --> 36:01.210
I will blow my brains out,
live on national television.

36:04.131 --> 36:08.130
Enjoy.

36:14.291 --> 36:17.290
Alisha?

36:17.291 --> 36:21.290
Kelly?

36:29.731 --> 36:33.730
What is that?

36:37.571 --> 36:39.730
It's milk.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.890
That milk guy?

36:41.891 --> 36:45.890
We need to get to the hotel.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.890
Oh, shit.

36:49.891 --> 36:53.890
No!

37:23.971 --> 37:27.530
And that, boys and girls, is how
you shoot yourself in the head.

37:27.531 --> 37:29.730
I wouldn't recommend
trying it at home.

37:44.611 --> 37:48.450
I'm not being funny, but you might
want to fuck off out of here.

37:48.451 --> 37:51.530
I'm expecting some seriously horny,
barely legal groupies

37:51.531 --> 37:53.090
knocking on that door any second.

37:53.091 --> 37:55.050
They're walking into a trap.

37:55.051 --> 37:56.530
What's that?

37:56.531 --> 37:58.010
The milk guy.

37:58.011 --> 38:00.010
He's got Alisha.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.530
What? When did this happen?

38:02.531 --> 38:06.330
He killed me, Nathan.

38:06.331 --> 38:10.330
I'm fucking dead.

38:24.271 --> 38:26.510
Curtis, wait!

38:26.511 --> 38:30.510
Alisha? Nikki?

38:32.791 --> 38:36.790
Curtis?

38:45.951 --> 38:49.950
You nipple-sucking, breast-feeding
momma's boy! You killed her!

38:56.591 --> 39:00.590
Does that feel strange?

39:08.751 --> 39:12.670
You can't...kill me.

39:12.671 --> 39:16.670
I'm...immortal...

39:18.711 --> 39:22.150
I'm not trying to kill you.

39:22.151 --> 39:26.150
That's the mozzarella wrapping
itself around your central cortex.

39:29.151 --> 39:33.150
You're going to spend the rest
of your life as a vegetable.

40:07.711 --> 40:11.710
Nathan?

42:41.151 --> 42:45.150
Why did you do it?

42:47.111 --> 42:51.110
Because the only time people like me
really get noticed

42:51.111 --> 42:53.750
is when we kill
a shitload of people.

42:53.751 --> 42:56.590
They'll talk about this for years.

42:56.591 --> 42:59.710
They'll talk about me.

42:59.711 --> 43:03.590
Monsieur grand fromage!

43:03.591 --> 43:07.350
That cheese shit won't
work on me, dickhead.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.390
I'm lactose intolerant.

43:09.391 --> 43:13.390
Then maybe I'll just
have to stab you instead.

43:34.631 --> 43:36.470
They're all dead.

43:36.471 --> 43:38.550
You have to save them.

43:38.551 --> 43:42.550
We have to go back to before we were
famous. We have to stop him. Do it!

44:04.191 --> 44:06.510
What are you looking at?

44:06.511 --> 44:10.510
Nothing.

44:16.391 --> 44:20.390
What?

44:20.551 --> 44:24.550
There's something we need to do.

44:57.951 --> 44:59.710
That's it, then.

44:59.711 --> 45:02.190
It's over.

45:02.191 --> 45:04.910
No more community service.

45:04.911 --> 45:07.510
I thought we'd be, like,
all celebrating and shit.

45:07.511 --> 45:11.510
It doesn't really feel
like there's much to celebrate.

45:12.351 --> 45:14.870
I just want you to know...

45:14.871 --> 45:18.870
being here with all of you, it's
been the best time of my life.

45:22.271 --> 45:26.270
I had a week in Spain last year.
That was way better.

45:26.471 --> 45:30.230
What is up with all of you?
All the shit we've been through.

45:30.231 --> 45:34.230
We're all here. We're all alive.

45:34.471 --> 45:35.510
We made it.

45:35.511 --> 45:39.510
Great(!) And I have no job,
no money, no girlfriend,

45:40.511 --> 45:44.510
nowhere to live, no useful skills or
qualifications. OK, so I'm immortal.

45:46.231 --> 45:49.150
But other than that, I've
basically got fuck all going for me.

45:49.151 --> 45:53.150
What are we going to do tomorrow?
Or the day after that?

45:53.311 --> 45:55.350
Huh? We have just been shat out

45:55.351 --> 45:59.350
onto a huge pool of piss with all
the other long-term unemployable.

46:05.551 --> 46:09.310
Does anyone fancy a drink?

46:09.311 --> 46:11.950
Yeah, sure, man.

46:11.951 --> 46:15.230
Y'know, apart from all the killing
and the dying and stuff,

46:15.231 --> 46:19.230
this community service really wasn't as
bad as I thought it was going to be.

46:30.751 --> 46:34.750
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

46:35.231 --> 46:39.070
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

46:39.071 --> 46:43.070
# I don't know
what's happened to the kids today

46:43.631 --> 46:47.630
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

46:47.791 --> 46:51.790
# I don't know
what's happened to the kids today

46:51.871 --> 46:55.870
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today. #

47:09.631 --> 47:11.950
I can give you your life back.

47:11.951 --> 47:13.710
There was this guy took my power.

47:13.711 --> 47:15.950
You sold your powers?

47:15.951 --> 47:16.910
Yeah, mate.

47:16.911 --> 47:20.870
That's how babies get turned into dwarves.
I like dwarves. Me too.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.830
My waters have broken!
The baby's coming!

47:22.831 --> 47:26.830
I'm Jesus Christ,
and I have been reborn.

47:27.591 --> 47:28.590
Where are you going?

47:28.591 --> 47:32.590
I'm going to kill Jesus.

48:04.031 --> 48:08.030
