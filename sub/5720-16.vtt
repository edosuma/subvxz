Oh, dang it.

01:21.027 --> 01:23.106
Eat this.

01:23.107 --> 01:24.106
I'm not hungry.

01:24.107 --> 01:25.460
Fascinating. Eat this.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.481
And drink this.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.048
You two are terrifying
when you're in agreement.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.789
- Get used to it.
- ELIZABETH: You don't have to know

01:31.792 --> 01:33.838
all that stuff by heart, you know.

01:33.839 --> 01:35.338
I want to be prepared.

01:35.339 --> 01:38.023
Classified briefs?
The CIA doesn't even read those.

01:38.024 --> 01:39.707
If you look too smart
on the first day of school,

01:39.708 --> 01:40.747
the other kids won't like you.

01:40.748 --> 01:42.287
(laughs)

01:42.288 --> 01:43.787
Hey, Dad.

01:43.788 --> 01:44.583
Hey.

01:44.584 --> 01:45.377
You look terrible.

01:45.378 --> 01:46.333
Thanks, honey.

01:46.334 --> 01:47.768
Crazy for you

01:47.769 --> 01:48.818
to be starting a new job.

01:48.819 --> 01:50.818
I mean, you just got
out of the hospital.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.818
It's not a new job;
it's more like an aspect

01:52.819 --> 01:55.108
of what I'm doing at the War
College, only less teaching.

01:55.109 --> 01:56.608
So what is it, exactly?

01:56.609 --> 01:58.268
Consulting.

01:58.269 --> 02:00.728
Everybody knows what
that's code for, Dad.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.212
It's intelligence work.

02:02.213 --> 02:03.672
Jace, I'm employed by
the Defense Department.

02:03.674 --> 02:05.173
You're not blowing the
lid off of anything

02:05.174 --> 02:06.333
with that observation.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.503
It just seems so soon.

02:07.504 --> 02:08.395
I'm fine, Noodle, really.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.634
Look, eating eggs, drinking juice.

02:09.636 --> 02:12.446
Reading some counter-terrorism...
breakfast of champions.

02:15.217 --> 02:16.491
How are you guys doing?

02:16.492 --> 02:17.387
ELIZABETH: You know you guys can

02:17.388 --> 02:18.803
talk to us about anything.

02:18.804 --> 02:20.263
You went through a lot.

02:20.264 --> 02:22.464
- That goes for adult children, too.
- STEVIE: I know.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.883
I'm fine.

02:23.884 --> 02:26.633
Pre-law is a very
overwhelming distraction.

02:26.634 --> 02:28.343
ELIZABETH: What about
that guy you were seeing,

02:28.344 --> 02:29.673
the one with the cute butt?

02:29.674 --> 02:30.633
Mom!

02:30.634 --> 02:32.093
Well, uh, <i>you </i> said it.

02:32.094 --> 02:32.929
Garrett, was it?

02:32.930 --> 02:33.763
Jareth.

02:33.764 --> 02:35.803
David Bowie's character
in the <i>Labyrinth?</i>

02:35.804 --> 02:37.263
You're dating the Goblin King?

02:37.264 --> 02:39.633
God, you guys, he's never
heard that one before.

02:39.634 --> 02:40.843
So how is he?

02:40.844 --> 02:42.554
He's fine.

02:43.594 --> 02:44.803
We've been busy.

02:44.804 --> 02:46.448
I... (sighs) This conversation

02:46.449 --> 02:48.302
is far more stressful
than the dirty bomb, okay?

02:48.303 --> 02:50.004
That's gallows humor;
it's a coping method.

02:50.029 --> 02:50.647
(mock gasp)

02:51.575 --> 02:52.825
- We want to meet him.
- Bye.

02:52.827 --> 02:55.074
- I won't say the David Bowie thing.
- (chuckles)

02:55.077 --> 02:57.363
(phone vibrates)

02:57.364 --> 02:58.449
(sighs)

02:58.450 --> 02:59.533
White House or State?

02:59.534 --> 03:00.613
White House.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.273
But it's just a text from Blake,

03:02.274 --> 03:05.403
so likely three rungs
down from imminent doom.

03:05.404 --> 03:06.654
(chuckles softly)

03:11.484 --> 03:13.533
(sighs)

03:13.534 --> 03:15.653
ELIZABETH: Make sure your father

03:15.654 --> 03:17.654
finishes his breakfast.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.587
REEVES: <i>Just after 0400 hours,</i>

03:20.588 --> 03:23.126
a ship carrying Libyan
refugees to Italy

03:23.128 --> 03:25.207
sent out a distress call
during a heavy storm.

03:25.208 --> 03:28.903
At great risk, an Italian
Navy warship answered,

03:28.904 --> 03:29.518
managed to save

03:29.519 --> 03:31.714
all 243 souls aboard,

03:31.715 --> 03:35.344
including a man who claims to
have seen Jibral Disah in Libya

03:35.345 --> 03:36.741
<i>since </i> the attack.

03:36.742 --> 03:38.451
JACKSON: We only have
20 minutes to decide

03:38.452 --> 03:39.741
whether to question him.

03:39.742 --> 03:41.951
Or, in keeping with their policy,

03:41.952 --> 03:44.661
the Italians will return
the refugees to Libya.

03:44.662 --> 03:48.624
Which is... now overrun
by Hizb Al-Shahid,

03:48.625 --> 03:49.661
so we'd probably lose

03:49.662 --> 03:52.876
whatever potential Intel
this man has forever.

03:52.877 --> 03:54.235
BECKER: Or he may not
have even seen Disah.

03:54.236 --> 03:56.347
Just looking to get off a sinking boat.

03:56.348 --> 03:58.194
But what do we know, Ephraim?

03:58.195 --> 03:59.799
Moussa Al-Mukhtar is

03:59.800 --> 04:02.469
a Libyan mechanic
from the HS stronghold

04:02.470 --> 04:04.679
of Ajdabiya who claims

04:04.680 --> 04:07.379
that he was conscripted
to fix their vehicles.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.589
He says HS threatened his family

04:09.590 --> 04:11.259
if he didn't pledge loyalty.

04:11.260 --> 04:14.009
So they left ASAP for Italy.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.009
General Reeves,
how soon can we pick him up?

04:16.010 --> 04:17.548
ELIZABETH: Sir, I would advise

04:17.550 --> 04:19.339
against bringing him onto our ship.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.589
If news that the U.S.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.339
is taking custody of
this refugee gets out,

04:23.340 --> 04:25.788
it could telegraph our
lead to the enemy.

04:25.789 --> 04:26.687
BECKER: Mr. President,

04:26.688 --> 04:29.346
it doesn't matter where
we debrief this man.

04:29.347 --> 04:31.516
The fact is,
we're grasping at straws here.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.346
JACKSON: I'm no military man,

04:33.347 --> 04:36.136
but I'm pretty good with facts,
and the fact is,

04:36.137 --> 04:39.396
Hizb Al-Shahid set off
a radiological weapon

04:39.397 --> 04:40.976
in the United States.

04:40.977 --> 04:42.896
They still have enough
lethal nuclear material

04:42.897 --> 04:44.596
for three more bombs,
which Jibral Disah

04:44.597 --> 04:47.896
won't hesitate to use against us.

04:47.897 --> 04:51.476
And as to his-his location,
we know precisely...

04:51.477 --> 04:53.936
and again, I don't know the
military parlance here...

04:53.937 --> 04:55.596
jack diddly squat.

04:55.597 --> 04:58.016
So even if this mechanic is a straw,

04:58.017 --> 05:00.186
I propose we grasp it
with both damn hands

05:00.187 --> 05:02.436
before a bomb goes off in Times Square.

05:02.437 --> 05:04.726
Is it still our sacred duty

05:04.727 --> 05:06.306
to protect the American way of life,

05:06.307 --> 05:08.517
or am I missing something here?

05:11.847 --> 05:14.016
Excuse me, sir.

05:14.017 --> 05:17.016
Well, I guess that answers that.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.976
Keep the operation light.

05:18.977 --> 05:22.136
Tell the Italians that CIA
interrogators are on the way.

05:22.137 --> 05:24.976
This could be the break
we've been looking for.

05:24.977 --> 05:27.267
Yes, sir.

05:28.307 --> 05:30.727
Well, that was thorough.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.806
Are they gonna make you
sign me in every day?

05:34.807 --> 05:36.476
Security's extra spooked.

05:36.477 --> 05:39.596
And only top levels are aware
of Hizb Al-Shahid Issue Station.

05:39.597 --> 05:41.807
- Tell me there's a code name.
- Murphy Station.

05:41.810 --> 05:43.596
For the soap... it's a cleanup mission.

05:43.597 --> 05:45.846
So code names not your gift?

05:45.847 --> 05:48.766
I was in a hurry.
And we need to catch you up.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.396
Welcome to Murphy Station.

05:51.397 --> 05:54.846
As everybody knows,
this is the front line

05:54.847 --> 05:57.636
for our single most important
national security priority:

05:57.637 --> 06:00.896
to disrupt and dismantle
Hizb Al-Shahid.

06:00.897 --> 06:02.516
Meet your fellow team members.

06:02.517 --> 06:03.896
Mimi Jacobs,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.846
ex-FBI counter-terrorism
turned CIA analyst,

06:06.847 --> 06:08.636
with expertise in interrogations.

06:08.637 --> 06:11.846
Masterminds of the U.S.S. <i>Cole
</i> and Riyadh compound attacks.

06:11.847 --> 06:13.806
It was all her.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.726
It's possible I had some help.
It's good to meet you.

06:16.727 --> 06:17.936
Henry McCord.

06:17.937 --> 06:19.976
This is Jose Campos, ex-Special Forces,

06:19.977 --> 06:23.936
senior Intel CIA operative
with tours in Pakistan,

06:23.937 --> 06:25.516
Afghanistan and Iraq.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.976
If you're glad the Taliban
government fell, thank him.

06:27.977 --> 06:29.476
All in a day's work, huh?

06:29.477 --> 06:30.636
And you know Jane Fellows,

06:30.637 --> 06:32.266
Army captain, long stint at SOCOM,

06:32.267 --> 06:34.056
currently head of HUMINT at DIA.

06:34.057 --> 06:36.136
She's a lauded tactician
who's run enough

06:36.137 --> 06:38.976
covert ops to keep conspiracy
theorists awake at night.

06:38.977 --> 06:40.056
And apparently modest, too.

06:40.057 --> 06:41.726
I didn't know about half that stuff.

06:41.727 --> 06:43.846
(chuckles) Welcome back.
Can't keep a good man down.

06:43.847 --> 06:45.275
Well, when I heard I
didn't have to take orders

06:45.276 --> 06:46.806
from you anymore, they
couldn't keep me away.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.766
Henry here is a decorated Marine pilot

06:49.767 --> 06:53.016
whose recent DIA work
in Russia is the reason

06:53.017 --> 06:55.636
we aren't all bundled
up for nuclear winter.

06:55.637 --> 06:58.136
He's also a highly regarded theologian

06:58.137 --> 06:59.726
with expertise in Islam.

06:59.727 --> 07:01.306
We're fighting a radical ideology

07:01.307 --> 07:02.850
as much as any man.

07:02.851 --> 07:06.476
Look, we can talk religion till
the sacred cows come home,

07:06.477 --> 07:07.945
but at the end of the day,

07:07.946 --> 07:09.957
we're a hunter-killer team.

07:09.958 --> 07:13.936
We do our job right, and a whole
bunch of men are gonna die.

07:13.937 --> 07:16.016
I hope you're on board
with that, Professor.

07:16.017 --> 07:17.694
All in a day's work, right?

07:17.695 --> 07:18.990
JACKSON: Let's get started.

07:18.991 --> 07:20.320
President's first goal is

07:20.321 --> 07:23.660
the killing or capture of Jibral Disah

07:23.661 --> 07:25.370
before he strikes again.

07:25.371 --> 07:27.200
Now, as we know,

07:27.201 --> 07:29.120
he's been in the wind after escaping

07:29.121 --> 07:31.120
our drone attacks on his safe house.

07:31.121 --> 07:33.626
Leads are scarce;
they're growing scarcer

07:33.627 --> 07:35.580
since several prominent warlords in Libya

07:35.581 --> 07:37.490
declared their loyalty to him.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.990
Tripling HS's territory and fighters.

07:39.991 --> 07:42.080
JACKSON: Idris Al Bouri,
Umar Maziq, Hamza Kubar

07:42.081 --> 07:44.160
have all taken HS's lead

07:44.161 --> 07:47.762
and are engaged in ruthless
campaigns on dissenters.

07:47.763 --> 07:49.490
HENRY: Classic totalitarian tactic.

07:49.491 --> 07:51.854
Subdue the populace
quickly and brutally,

07:51.855 --> 07:54.003
- and no one dares speak up.
- JACKSON: Well, you better find

07:54.044 --> 07:56.173
someone who will, and fast.

07:56.174 --> 07:59.253
The entire Defense and
IC is working this.

07:59.254 --> 08:02.923
POTUS is even quarterbacking
a prospective lead as we speak.

08:02.924 --> 08:04.923
Everything deemed at all credible

08:04.924 --> 08:06.753
will be funneled to this room.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.133
You're the tip of the spear.

08:09.134 --> 08:11.343
The work that happens in this room

08:11.344 --> 08:14.213
could stop the next attack.

08:14.214 --> 08:15.754
Or not.

08:22.004 --> 08:23.804
(phone chimes)

08:25.835 --> 08:27.133
_

08:29.964 --> 08:33.342
So you didn't lose your
phone or let it die.

08:33.344 --> 08:36.003
I, uh... I'll cross those
off the list, then.

08:36.004 --> 08:37.883
Jareth. Hi.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.253
Sorry. Um, I was
about to text you back,

08:40.254 --> 08:41.754
but I'm late for class.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.753
Oh. The brotherly hug.

08:45.754 --> 08:47.803
Have I been put in the friend
zone without my knowledge?

08:47.804 --> 08:49.504
- What are you talking about?
- Let's see.

08:49.507 --> 08:51.543
Unanswered calls and texts,

08:51.544 --> 08:53.884
- except for the odd cryptic emoji...
- Sorry. I've been

08:53.887 --> 08:56.004
- so crazy...
- Saying things like "I have been so crazy."

08:56.007 --> 08:58.924
- I'll call you later?
- Saying things like "I'll call you later."

08:58.927 --> 09:00.803
I really will.

09:00.804 --> 09:03.593
I thought we liked each other.

09:03.594 --> 09:06.753
Even talked about me meeting
your family, if I recall.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.753
We do like each other.

09:08.754 --> 09:11.044
Honestly, I just... I have to go.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.673
Right, well, I'll, uh...

09:14.674 --> 09:16.924
let you get on with it, then.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.303
Bloody hell.

09:20.304 --> 09:21.593
No, I won't, will I?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.633
Um, look,

09:23.634 --> 09:26.713
this isn't my first rodeo... cowgirl.

09:26.714 --> 09:30.343
Uh... I know what the
brush-off feels like.

09:30.344 --> 09:33.133
I just thought that you'd be
someone to do it to my face.

09:33.134 --> 09:36.133
Please just do that.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.133
I can't.

09:37.134 --> 09:38.343
Why not?

09:38.344 --> 09:39.754
Because it wouldn't be true.

09:41.964 --> 09:44.463
I still really want to see you.

09:44.464 --> 09:46.804
I'm just really late for class.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.044
I'll call you.

10:01.924 --> 10:03.133
(quietly): Hey.

10:03.134 --> 10:04.303
I'm sorry to interrupt.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.383
I just wanted to apologize for Jose.

10:07.384 --> 10:08.843
HENRY: No need. I've met a hundred guys

10:08.844 --> 10:10.543
like him in the Marines.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.883
He's an ops guy.

10:11.884 --> 10:14.843
He spent a little too much
time outside the wire.

10:14.844 --> 10:16.923
And he's naturally suspicious
of analysts like me,

10:16.924 --> 10:18.803
who sit indoors with highlighters,

10:18.804 --> 10:20.923
looking for odd
discrepancies and patterns.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.343
Or professors who spend their day

10:23.344 --> 10:25.593
doing close readings of obscure texts.

10:25.594 --> 10:26.923
(chuckles)

10:26.924 --> 10:29.303
So you're an interrogator, too, yeah?

10:29.304 --> 10:31.463
Yeah, it's not as edgy as it sounds.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.213
You just get them in a room

10:33.214 --> 10:35.883
and establish a rapport
and talk and talk and talk

10:35.884 --> 10:39.543
until some little detail
reveals what's really going on.

10:39.544 --> 10:41.093
Sounds like raising a teenager.

10:41.094 --> 10:43.343
Where do you think I got my skills?

10:43.344 --> 10:44.843
Look alive, people.

10:44.844 --> 10:45.883
We have visitors.

10:45.884 --> 10:46.753
Hello, everyone.

10:46.754 --> 10:48.503
Sorry to barge in.

10:48.504 --> 10:50.463
This isn't what I had in
mind for our first meeting,

10:50.464 --> 10:52.043
but right now we're
on a tight deadline.

10:52.044 --> 10:54.383
Everybody know
Secretary of State McCord?

10:54.384 --> 10:55.713
You can all say your hellos later.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.843
CI interrogators are
about to interview a man

10:57.844 --> 11:00.503
who claims to have seen
Jibral Disah since the attack.

11:00.504 --> 11:04.133
This is a live, secure feed
from the Italian naval ship

11:04.134 --> 11:05.148
that plucked him

11:05.149 --> 11:07.198
and 42 other Libyan civilians

11:07.199 --> 11:08.818
from a sinking refugee boat last night.

11:08.819 --> 11:13.488
You've got two hours to figure
out if this guy's for real.

11:13.489 --> 11:15.358
After that, the Italians
want their ship back.

11:15.359 --> 11:17.318
Stop for clarifications,

11:17.319 --> 11:18.988
feed the interrogators questions.

11:18.989 --> 11:20.778
That's his file.

11:20.779 --> 11:22.489
Clock's ticking.

11:26.649 --> 11:28.908
HENRY: Other than those two occasions,

11:28.909 --> 11:32.148
were there any other times
he personally saw Jibral Disah?

11:32.149 --> 11:36.488
Moussa, did you see Jibral
Disah any other times?

11:36.489 --> 11:38.528
(translating in Arabic)

11:38.529 --> 11:39.529
(speaking Arabic)

11:46.989 --> 11:49.318
Yes. Once they blindfolded me

11:49.319 --> 11:51.948
and took me to the desert
to work on a truck.

11:51.949 --> 11:54.148
That's when I saw
the emir and his wife.

11:54.149 --> 11:56.358
Wait a minute.
He went out to the desert

11:56.359 --> 11:58.528
and saw Jibral Disah
and one of his wives?

11:58.529 --> 12:01.028
Or he's spinning tales to get a visa.

12:01.029 --> 12:03.738
Did they blindfold him
or put a hood on him?

12:03.739 --> 12:05.408
Did they blindfold you

12:05.409 --> 12:06.864
or put a hood on you?

12:06.865 --> 12:08.318
(translates in Arabic)

12:08.319 --> 12:10.149
- (speaks Arabic)
- TRANSLATOR: It was a hood.

12:10.152 --> 12:12.778
What was wrong with the truck?

12:12.779 --> 12:14.239
- What was wrong with the truck?
- (translates)

12:14.242 --> 12:16.569
(speaking Arabic)

12:17.609 --> 12:19.608
TRANSLATOR: I worked on the engine.

12:19.609 --> 12:22.358
They overheated it trying
to get out of a ditch.

12:22.359 --> 12:25.148
Did they ask him to do
anything else to the truck?

12:25.149 --> 12:27.278
Was that the only service
you performed?

12:27.279 --> 12:29.358
(translates)

12:29.359 --> 12:31.149
(speaking Arabic)

12:35.649 --> 12:37.778
TRANSLATOR:
I got the clay out of the tires.

12:37.779 --> 12:39.318
They were caked in this red clay.

12:39.319 --> 12:41.278
I had to dig it out for traction.

12:41.279 --> 12:43.278
Look, the other two times
he saw Jibral Disah,

12:43.279 --> 12:44.608
it was at a distance.

12:44.609 --> 12:47.908
So question is: how did he
know it was Jibral Disah?

12:47.909 --> 12:49.648
How did you know it was Disah?

12:49.649 --> 12:51.028
(translates)

12:51.029 --> 12:52.448
(speaking Arabic)

12:52.449 --> 12:54.358
TRANSLATOR: His picture was
on the television every day.

12:54.359 --> 12:56.358
It was four days after
the bombing in America.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.238
I'm sure it was him.

12:58.239 --> 13:02.318
How did he know the woman
with Jibral Disah was his wife?

13:02.319 --> 13:04.537
- How did you know he was with his wife?
- (translates)

13:04.538 --> 13:06.068
(speaking Arabic)

13:06.069 --> 13:07.528
TRANSLATOR: She was wearing a ring.

13:07.529 --> 13:09.108
And he called her "wife."

13:09.109 --> 13:10.948
And I noticed that her hands were red

13:10.949 --> 13:12.528
from the red clay, I think.

13:12.529 --> 13:14.148
She was wearing a niqab, of course,

13:14.149 --> 13:16.529
- so I didn't see her face.
- FELLOWS: CIA's had eyes on both

13:16.532 --> 13:19.408
of Jibral Disah's wives in
Saudi Arabia since the attack.

13:19.409 --> 13:20.698
They haven't left the country.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.148
They know we're watching.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.148
They don't want them to lead us to him.

13:24.149 --> 13:26.526
The question is: who is this woman?

13:26.527 --> 13:28.362
You mean the one in the
head-to-toe garbage bag

13:28.363 --> 13:29.945
with a hidden face we can't I.D.?

13:29.946 --> 13:30.698
Guess what,

13:30.699 --> 13:31.818
she's nobody.

13:31.819 --> 13:33.198
Without corroborating evidence,

13:33.199 --> 13:35.908
all we have is Moussa's
word on any of this.

13:35.909 --> 13:37.318
So...

13:37.319 --> 13:39.068
do we think we have anything here?

13:39.069 --> 13:42.488
The president needs our answer.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.949
You know mine.

13:52.949 --> 13:54.988
So you recommend cutting him loose.

13:54.989 --> 13:56.408
Murphy Station deems his claims,

13:56.409 --> 13:59.006
including that Disah was
traveling with a wife,

13:59.007 --> 14:00.108
not credible.

14:00.109 --> 14:01.778
I'm sorry, sir.

14:01.779 --> 14:04.698
I hoped this would pan out.

14:04.699 --> 14:07.738
So I guess I bawled you
out for nothing, Gordon.

14:07.739 --> 14:09.028
Bess, thank the Italians.

14:09.029 --> 14:10.319
They can take him from here.

14:12.359 --> 14:16.574
You mean ship him and the rest
of the refugees back to Libya?

14:16.575 --> 14:19.927
They are Libyan citizens
on an Italian ship.

14:19.928 --> 14:21.068
Sir, are we really

14:21.069 --> 14:23.278
going to send them back
to the terrorist haven

14:23.279 --> 14:24.608
they risked their lives to escape?

14:24.609 --> 14:26.778
This is the U.S., not the U.N.

14:26.779 --> 14:29.960
Well, then let's find a UNHCR
camp that'll take them.

14:29.961 --> 14:31.278
Much as I would love to help,

14:31.279 --> 14:34.149
these refugees do not fall
under our jurisdiction.

14:34.989 --> 14:36.698
Understood.

14:36.699 --> 14:38.779
I'll make the call, sir.

14:52.699 --> 14:55.698
Jane, when does the Italian
ship dock in Tripoli?

14:55.699 --> 14:57.198
Uh...

14:57.199 --> 14:58.608
2200. Why?

14:58.609 --> 15:01.448
Have you read the CIA interview
with this guy Ramzi Shamekh?

15:01.449 --> 15:03.488
Just the highlights, yeah.
He's an old CIA source

15:03.489 --> 15:06.488
who they interviewed post-attack
'cause he's got a cousin in HS.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.108
Wasn't much else there though, right?

15:08.109 --> 15:10.028
He says Disah used to
make frequent visits

15:10.029 --> 15:12.778
to the Al Wahat District
before and after the attacks.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.970
Well, that's near
our mechanic's village.

15:14.971 --> 15:16.139
- So...
- So look at the map.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.988
It's famous for its red clay flats.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.608
There's your corroboration.

15:20.609 --> 15:22.908
Two sources that put Disah in the area

15:22.909 --> 15:24.488
in the days after the bombing.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.318
And one of them's
about to step off a boat

15:26.319 --> 15:27.488
and straight into the enemy's hands.

15:27.489 --> 15:28.818
We have to tell Russell.

15:28.819 --> 15:31.908
We don't have time.
Now, just back me up here.

15:31.909 --> 15:33.189
I'm going straight to Elizabeth.

15:33.859 --> 15:35.859
We've got to stop that ship.

15:38.552 --> 15:45.542
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b>

15:51.636 --> 15:53.178
ELIZABETH: <i>The Italians aren't happy,</i>

15:53.179 --> 15:55.841
- but they didn't dock in Tripoli.
- Good.

15:55.842 --> 15:59.257
CIA's reaching out to their
source, this Shamekh guy.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.427
We can check his Intel
against Moussa's interview,

16:01.428 --> 16:02.587
and that'll be that.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.612
Not quite.

16:04.806 --> 16:06.401
The Italians have a price.

16:06.402 --> 16:07.691
Oh, here we go.

16:07.692 --> 16:09.388
The Libyan refugees.

16:09.389 --> 16:12.731
If we want Moussa, they insist

16:12.732 --> 16:15.311
we take responsibility
for all 243 aboard.

16:15.312 --> 16:18.901
Whoa. Take in refugees from
the country that-that harbored

16:18.902 --> 16:21.561
the mastermind of a
week-old dirty bomb attack?

16:21.562 --> 16:23.652
- Yeah, we're not doing that.
- Why?

16:23.655 --> 16:25.981
POTUS already announced

16:25.982 --> 16:29.269
the U.S. would resettle
20,000 Libyans this year.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.651
That was before the bombing,
which is bad enough.

16:31.652 --> 16:33.231
Now the president will be labeled

16:33.232 --> 16:34.691
Aider and Comforter in Chief.

16:34.692 --> 16:35.731
Pitch me something else.

16:35.732 --> 16:38.481
Listen, even if we strike
intelligence gold,

16:38.482 --> 16:41.731
what good will it do if we
return these folks to Tripoli

16:41.732 --> 16:43.561
and they broadcast what they've seen?

16:43.562 --> 16:45.771
We need to keep them under wraps.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.691
So for a few days of quiet,
we buy ourselves

16:47.692 --> 16:49.561
a political problem
that'll dog us all the way

16:49.562 --> 16:50.941
through the election? No, thanks.

16:50.942 --> 16:53.561
What happened to protecting
our way of life, Russell?

16:53.562 --> 16:54.651
What happened to your argument about

16:54.652 --> 16:55.851
losing our strategic advantage?

16:55.852 --> 16:57.089
I mean, how do you propose

16:57.090 --> 16:59.609
to just keep the transfer of 243 people

16:59.610 --> 17:03.151
from an Italian naval vessel to
an American one out of the news?

17:03.152 --> 17:07.352
Oh, Russell, don't you know me by now?

17:13.061 --> 17:15.151
Joint naval exercises?

17:15.152 --> 17:18.611
Well, you're not really
selling it, but yeah.

17:18.612 --> 17:19.941
If the media asks

17:19.942 --> 17:21.611
why an American cruiser

17:21.612 --> 17:23.810
is docked to an Italian warship,
we say....

17:23.811 --> 17:25.231
"Joint naval exercises."

17:25.232 --> 17:26.771
Better. Matt.

17:26.771 --> 17:27.830
Hmm?

17:27.832 --> 17:30.192
Help the Pentagon craft a
carefully-worded statement

17:30.193 --> 17:32.441
to that effect which
actually reveals nothing.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.412
That's the only kind they write.

17:33.413 --> 17:35.611
Three cheers for the bland
Soviet-style pronouncements,

17:35.612 --> 17:37.061
because I want the media to walk

17:37.062 --> 17:38.580
- right past this, got it?
- Got it.

17:38.581 --> 17:40.351
Okay. And, Nadine, we need to loop in

17:40.352 --> 17:41.881
a tight circle on the Hill.

17:41.882 --> 17:43.271
- Gang of Eight.
- No one else.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.351
And Jay and Blake can
help you with that, okay?

17:45.352 --> 17:46.651
JAY: Wait, what do we tell them,

17:46.652 --> 17:48.691
that State is secretly
doing intake interviews

17:48.692 --> 17:49.981
with Libyan refugees
in the Mediterranean?

17:49.982 --> 17:51.771
In order to keep information

17:51.772 --> 17:54.731
out of the hands of terrorists, yes.

17:54.732 --> 17:56.561
And if the senators raise
certain concerns?

17:56.562 --> 17:58.191
About finding Jibral Disah?

17:58.192 --> 18:00.021
NADINE: I believe what
Blake is referring to

18:00.022 --> 18:02.851
is transferring Libyans
to a border camp so soon

18:02.852 --> 18:04.191
after the attack.

18:04.192 --> 18:05.771
Okay, so remind them

18:05.772 --> 18:07.691
that the asylum vetting process

18:07.692 --> 18:10.611
is so thorough that it takes
a minimum of two years.

18:10.612 --> 18:11.901
Hell, remind them

18:11.903 --> 18:13.481
what the plaque on the
Statue of Liberty says.

18:13.482 --> 18:16.061
But only if they get
shirty with you, okay?

18:16.062 --> 18:16.897
Yes, ma'am.

18:16.898 --> 18:18.859
All right. I want this
sewn up by end of day.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.941
And if anyone comes sniffing around,

18:20.942 --> 18:22.561
asking what we're up to, we say...

18:22.562 --> 18:25.562
- ALL: "Joint naval exercises."
- There we go.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.100
Hey.

18:28.562 --> 18:31.271
The CIA's informant, Shamekh,

18:31.272 --> 18:33.691
says he's got significant
Intel on Jibral Disah

18:33.692 --> 18:35.311
that we're gonna want to hear.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.191
And how much will that cost us?

18:37.192 --> 18:38.981
Five million. Cash.

18:38.982 --> 18:41.191
And he won't talk without
a face-to-face handoff

18:41.192 --> 18:43.061
at a secured location in Libya.

18:43.062 --> 18:44.851
How do we know he's not
working for the bad guys?

18:44.852 --> 18:46.111
Could be a setup.

18:46.112 --> 18:47.441
That's your call.

18:47.442 --> 18:50.652
One of you would do the
interrogation, in Libya.

18:51.942 --> 18:53.561
Shamekh wants to meet tomorrow,

18:53.562 --> 18:55.112
so you don't have much time to decide.

18:59.563 --> 19:02.151
Shamekh gets his info from
his radical terrorist cousin.

19:02.152 --> 19:05.111
My guess is, blood ain't
the only thing they share.

19:05.112 --> 19:07.521
He does describe himself
as a true believer.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.941
I have analyzed his interviews

19:08.942 --> 19:10.611
with the CIA closely,

19:10.612 --> 19:12.901
and he reads the Qur'an metaphorically.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.401
He views the Hadiths in context.

19:15.402 --> 19:17.061
Yeah, he's devout,

19:17.062 --> 19:20.151
but I don't get
Salifist jihadist from him.

19:20.152 --> 19:21.771
Well, I'm sold.

19:21.772 --> 19:23.231
He's practically Episcopalian.

19:23.232 --> 19:24.611
Let's cut the check.

19:24.612 --> 19:26.521
A true fundamentalist wouldn't
even hint at such beliefs.

19:26.522 --> 19:27.691
He'd be an apostate.

19:27.692 --> 19:28.981
Maybe he's playing us for the money.

19:28.982 --> 19:30.731
I mean, this whole thing
could be a shakedown.

19:30.732 --> 19:32.401
Whatever it is, it stinks
and the timeline's too short,

19:32.402 --> 19:33.401
and we should keep walking.

19:33.402 --> 19:35.191
I need a decision.

19:35.192 --> 19:36.561
I guess the question is:

19:36.562 --> 19:38.562
is how confident are you
in your assessment, Henry?

19:42.942 --> 19:45.981
Look, I can't predict
what this guy's gonna do,

19:45.982 --> 19:48.561
but from where I sit...

19:48.562 --> 19:50.612
he's a survivor, he's not a radical.

19:51.772 --> 19:52.772
I agree.

19:55.902 --> 19:58.441
Yeah. Me, too.

19:58.442 --> 20:00.111
Okay, then. Let's go for it.

20:00.112 --> 20:01.941
I'll take it to POTUS.

20:01.942 --> 20:05.231
In the meantime, Mimi, you're up.

20:05.233 --> 20:07.693
Let's put those famous
interrogation skills to work.

20:09.522 --> 20:11.692
I guess I got some packing to do.

20:14.482 --> 20:16.652
(quietly): You better hope
you're right, Professor.

20:22.902 --> 20:24.901
So the kids got the PG version...

20:24.902 --> 20:26.231
(sniffs)

20:26.232 --> 20:28.351
...of dad's first day.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.352
What's really up?

20:34.562 --> 20:36.941
We can actually talk now.

20:36.942 --> 20:39.691
I know that Conrad approved

20:39.692 --> 20:41.691
the meet with Shamekh for tomorrow.

20:41.692 --> 20:44.231
The CIA's improvising a safe house

20:44.232 --> 20:46.191
in a country overrun by terrorists.

20:46.192 --> 20:48.151
Mimi's on a plane as we speak.

20:48.152 --> 20:50.441
It spooks me how quickly we're moving.

20:50.442 --> 20:53.901
Hey, the government could take
months to send a tax refund;

20:53.902 --> 20:57.691
when it comes to spy stuff,
we move fast.

20:57.692 --> 20:58.691
(chuckles)

20:58.692 --> 21:01.272
STEVIE: Okay. I will see you there.

21:03.352 --> 21:07.021
Okay. So, just to put your mind
at ease about my social life,

21:07.023 --> 21:08.691
guess who's coming to dinner tomorrow?

21:08.692 --> 21:09.651
Jared?

21:09.652 --> 21:11.651
<i>Jareth.</i> Like the David Bowie movie.

21:11.652 --> 21:12.811
You guys, you have to get

21:12.812 --> 21:14.691
all this stuff out of your system now.

21:14.692 --> 21:16.271
You can't embarrass me with him.

21:16.272 --> 21:17.441
Oh, I think we can.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.982
- Like falling off a log.
- Seriously.

21:18.985 --> 21:20.061
I like him.

21:20.062 --> 21:21.561
Plus, he's British,

21:21.562 --> 21:23.651
so he might not even get
your sense of humor.

21:23.652 --> 21:25.481
I heard we're huge in the U.K.

21:25.482 --> 21:27.651
(British accent):
We will be proper citizens.

21:27.652 --> 21:28.652
- (chuckles)
- Oh, my...

21:28.655 --> 21:29.382
Should I cook?

21:29.383 --> 21:30.111
Um...

21:30.112 --> 21:31.441
Of course not. What should we order?

21:31.442 --> 21:33.901
I'll cook.
You just show up and be cool.

21:33.902 --> 21:35.441
We can do that, I swear.

21:35.442 --> 21:37.442
Okay. Good night.

21:39.482 --> 21:41.981
God, it'll be nice to
do something normal.

21:41.982 --> 21:43.981
I wonder how old he is.

21:43.982 --> 21:45.311
We like him.

21:45.312 --> 21:47.312
Got it.

21:50.522 --> 21:52.611
(elevator bell dings)

21:52.612 --> 21:53.771
Uh-oh.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.351
Anxious Daisy face.

21:55.352 --> 21:57.271
So, I swatted back most reporters,

21:57.272 --> 21:59.191
but one called his senator for comment.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.271
That senator would be
Carlos Morejon from Arizona.

22:02.273 --> 22:03.731
It's not a good thing.

22:03.732 --> 22:06.811
He ran on a strict
anti-immigration platform.

22:06.812 --> 22:08.151
His slogan was...

22:08.152 --> 22:10.561
Yes, yes, I remember.

22:10.562 --> 22:14.651
"Keep Arizona secure
for the Arizonans."

22:14.652 --> 22:15.851
That's it.

22:15.852 --> 22:18.151
Really just rolls right off your tongue.

22:18.152 --> 22:20.151
Well, he sniffed around,

22:20.152 --> 22:22.311
found out about the Libyan refugees.

22:22.312 --> 22:24.611
He's holding a press conference
to denounce the plan tonight.

22:24.612 --> 22:26.431
Right before the Shamekh meet.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.334
He's gonna blow it up.

22:27.335 --> 22:29.561
And risk the lives of
ten intelligence agents

22:29.562 --> 22:30.981
in the process.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.853
Nadine, will you get me Senator
Morejon right away, please.

22:42.696 --> 22:43.616
(door opens, closes)

22:43.617 --> 22:45.451
Senator Morejon.

22:45.452 --> 22:46.242
Welcome.

22:46.243 --> 22:47.030
The inner sanctum.

22:47.031 --> 22:48.780
(chuckles) Please, have a seat.

22:49.575 --> 22:51.981
Oh, you know, I've tried
to get meetings before,

22:51.982 --> 22:53.561
but you're always booked.

22:53.562 --> 22:55.811
But it looks like I have
your attention now.

22:55.812 --> 22:57.181
Unfortunately, it has to be short.

22:57.182 --> 22:58.260
I have a press conference.

22:58.261 --> 22:59.639
Call it off, Senator.

23:00.312 --> 23:03.311
It's a matter of national security.

23:03.312 --> 23:04.394
And the matter is?

23:04.395 --> 23:05.382
Classified.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.999
But American lives are at stake.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.038
Oh, yes, because of this
reckless and secretive plan

23:10.039 --> 23:11.781
that you've cooked up
to bring a boatload

23:11.782 --> 23:13.431
of potential terrorists to our shores.

23:13.432 --> 23:16.596
Senator, you know as well as I

23:16.597 --> 23:18.795
that only a fraction of the one percent

23:18.796 --> 23:22.005
of the nearly one million
refugees admitted to the U.S.

23:22.007 --> 23:26.386
since 9/11 have ever been
arrested on terrorism charges.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.556
It only takes one.

23:28.557 --> 23:29.966
Look at the dirty bomb.

23:29.967 --> 23:33.386
Which was perpetrated by
a native-born American citizen.

23:33.387 --> 23:35.506
Good folks in my state
know the difference

23:35.507 --> 23:38.466
between native-born and real,
and I'm wondering

23:38.467 --> 23:39.847
if you do.

23:41.847 --> 23:44.926
Morejon... that's a Cuban name, right?

23:44.927 --> 23:47.096
When did your parents
arrive in the U.S.?

23:47.097 --> 23:49.096
I'm guessing that you
know the answer to that.

23:49.097 --> 23:51.556
Of course I do;
I'm the Secretary of State.

23:51.557 --> 23:54.556
They were Marielitos,
part of the boatlift of 1980.

23:54.557 --> 23:56.556
They were fleeing a repressive regime.

23:56.557 --> 23:59.636
Which is why the good folks in
these parts gave them visas...

23:59.637 --> 24:01.596
That you and your president
have cravenly cozied up to.

24:01.597 --> 24:03.676
...instead of smearing
them as potential

24:03.677 --> 24:07.557
Communist sleeper agents
sent to destroy our way of life.

24:08.637 --> 24:11.676
But, hell, your boat made it here...

24:11.677 --> 24:13.257
what do you care, right?

24:15.507 --> 24:17.756
You should watch my press conference.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.466
I have a lot to say about you.

24:19.467 --> 24:21.136
You have a good day, Madam Secretary.

24:21.137 --> 24:23.466
My children were at that blast,
and my husband

24:23.467 --> 24:25.256
suffered radiation poisoning.

24:25.257 --> 24:27.596
Where were you that day?

24:27.597 --> 24:30.636
At a fund-raiser in Phoenix.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.387
So cut the bluster and sit down.
I'm gonna read you in.

24:38.597 --> 24:40.466
One second.

24:40.467 --> 24:43.216
TECHOPS is having trouble with the line.

24:43.217 --> 24:45.006
<i>Marhaba!</i>

24:45.007 --> 24:46.506
Greetings from Libya.

24:46.507 --> 24:47.926
Mimi, good to see you.

24:47.927 --> 24:49.296
How are things looking over there?

24:49.297 --> 24:50.716
Our perimeter is secure.

24:50.717 --> 24:53.096
ISR drones on all roads in and out.

24:53.097 --> 24:55.176
Our side of the equation's tight.

24:55.177 --> 24:56.466
Any word from Shamekh?

24:56.467 --> 24:57.796
He's en route.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.886
We just have to cool our
heels till he gets here.

24:59.887 --> 25:01.676
Russell,

25:01.677 --> 25:03.596
I got to say...

25:03.597 --> 25:06.426
your ability to gather
five million in 24 hours...

25:06.427 --> 25:08.596
remember that when I ask for a raise.

25:08.597 --> 25:10.506
(chuckles)
After this, you'll deserve one.

25:10.507 --> 25:12.096
We'll see you in a bit.

25:12.097 --> 25:13.097
Yep.

25:21.507 --> 25:23.636
Well, it's press conference o'clock.

25:23.637 --> 25:26.096
Daisy says Morejon's
office is quiet for now.

25:26.097 --> 25:28.297
- Keep her on him through the whole meet.
- (phone vibrating)

25:28.300 --> 25:31.136
If he goes near a camera, she's
ordered to pull a fire alarm.

25:31.137 --> 25:33.056
It's Stevie.

25:33.057 --> 25:35.136
Hey, honey, what's up?
I'm just rushing into a meeting.

25:35.137 --> 25:37.097
Now? Jareth's arriving any minute.

25:38.507 --> 25:40.346
That was tonight?

25:40.347 --> 25:41.596
You forgot?

25:41.597 --> 25:43.256
(sighs) I was preoccupied with work

25:43.257 --> 25:44.676
and I forget to tell Blake.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.096
Forget to tell Blake what?

25:46.097 --> 25:47.926
Seriously, you're not coming?

25:47.927 --> 25:50.556
There is a lot going on
here today. Baby, I'm sorry.

25:50.557 --> 25:51.717
What about Dad?

25:53.097 --> 25:54.966
He's working, too.

25:54.967 --> 25:56.596
It's special circumstances.

25:56.597 --> 25:57.636
I'm so sorry.

25:57.637 --> 25:59.676
It's okay. I'm sure it's important.

25:59.677 --> 26:00.676
Let's reschedule.

26:00.677 --> 26:02.346
I really want to meet him.

26:02.347 --> 26:03.926
I promise I'll be cool.

26:03.927 --> 26:05.676
And show up?

26:05.677 --> 26:06.966
Okay, you get to have that.

26:06.967 --> 26:07.966
(doorbell rings)

26:07.967 --> 26:09.466
That's him. I got to go.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.467
Okay, have fun. I love you.

26:20.717 --> 26:22.506
Now, don't get too excited.

26:22.507 --> 26:23.926
These are for your mum.

26:23.927 --> 26:26.556
Oh, very strategic.

26:26.557 --> 26:29.136
I hail from the land of common sense.

26:29.137 --> 26:31.596
(chuckles)

26:31.597 --> 26:32.676
Right.

26:32.677 --> 26:34.796
So, slight change of plan.

26:34.797 --> 26:36.757
Um, as it turns out...

26:38.677 --> 26:39.756
Mr. President.

26:39.757 --> 26:41.557
Bess.

26:44.057 --> 26:47.056
(quietly): Did you remember
the Jareth dinner tonight?

26:47.057 --> 26:48.716
That was tonight?

26:48.717 --> 26:49.697
That's what I said.

26:49.698 --> 26:50.676
(sighs)

26:50.677 --> 26:53.256
Director Ware, we have eyes
on a vehicle approaching.

26:53.257 --> 26:54.756
Copy, Babylon.

26:54.757 --> 26:56.596
Can you get a positive I.D.?

26:56.597 --> 26:58.006
Copy.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.387
Confirming.

27:06.757 --> 27:08.596
It's Shamekh's jeep,

27:08.597 --> 27:11.096
approaching from the north as planned.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.346
Are we sure Shamekh's driving?

27:12.347 --> 27:14.216
Not yet. We'll confirm
at the checkpoint.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.506
What happens after
the initial approach?

27:16.507 --> 27:18.886
Once we I.D. Shamekh,
one of our guys will direct him

27:18.887 --> 27:20.796
to a designated parking area.

27:20.797 --> 27:24.637
Then Agent Jacobs escorts him in
and begins the interrogation.

27:30.467 --> 27:32.466
I.D. confirmed.

27:32.467 --> 27:33.677
It's Shamekh.

27:34.847 --> 27:36.846
We've told him to park at the wall,

27:36.847 --> 27:38.597
a safe distance from the house.

27:43.467 --> 27:46.507
♪ ♪

28:12.347 --> 28:14.506
Slowly.

28:14.507 --> 28:16.507
(speaking Arabic)

28:23.967 --> 28:25.427
- (men shouting)
- Get him out of there.

28:25.428 --> 28:26.136
Quick Reaction Force, engage.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.177
(shouts in Arabic)

28:29.217 --> 28:30.796
EXFIL operators.

28:31.696 --> 28:33.257
Babylon, talk to me.

28:33.783 --> 28:36.097
Babylon, are you hit?

28:36.757 --> 28:39.257
(all murmuring)

29:02.007 --> 29:03.587
(sighs)

29:13.304 --> 29:14.614
What went wrong?

29:15.424 --> 29:18.132
Nothing about Shamekh
presents as Jihadi.

29:18.264 --> 29:20.423
Somehow they played us.

29:20.424 --> 29:23.173
Because that's what they do.

29:23.174 --> 29:26.513
They sit around and think about
how to kill people all day long.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.302
Something happened, I'm telling you.

29:28.303 --> 29:30.343
The guy is not a martyr.
He's in it for the money.

29:30.344 --> 29:35.343
CIA and DNI will comb the scene,
evaluate security breaches.

29:35.344 --> 29:38.939
Forensics will gather any
bomb fragments for analysis.

29:39.175 --> 29:41.133
It wasn't your fault, babe.

29:41.134 --> 29:44.963
She had kids, you know... Mimi.

29:44.964 --> 29:46.964
I know.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.049
AUTOMATED VOICE: Well done!

29:53.050 --> 29:54.174
(lasers firing)

30:01.344 --> 30:02.513
(chuckles softly)

30:02.514 --> 30:03.723
Oh.

30:03.724 --> 30:05.673
Alison just texted.

30:05.674 --> 30:08.013
She is stuck

30:08.014 --> 30:10.223
at a friend's house
studying for midterms,

30:10.224 --> 30:12.223
so more for us.

30:12.224 --> 30:14.383
I actually prefer eating in bulk.

30:14.384 --> 30:15.513
Makes me feel American.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.383
What is that?

30:16.384 --> 30:18.133
Caramelized onion risotto.

30:18.134 --> 30:19.724
- Looks like hospital food.
- JARETH: As it turns out,

30:19.727 --> 30:21.723
I love hospital food.

30:21.724 --> 30:23.423
If it looks like that,
which it doesn't.

30:23.424 --> 30:25.423
I might've overcooked it.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.803
Seriously, stuff they gave Dad...
exact same color.

30:27.804 --> 30:29.207
Your dad was in hospital?

30:29.208 --> 30:30.223
Not really.

30:30.224 --> 30:31.199
Last week.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.173
He was in and out.

30:32.174 --> 30:35.173
I hope you like garlic,
because this is loaded.

30:35.174 --> 30:37.361
"In and out"?
He was in critical condition.

30:37.362 --> 30:39.203
Jason, if you're just
gonna make fun of my food,

30:39.204 --> 30:40.187
you can leave the table.

30:40.188 --> 30:42.303
I'm not talking about your food
anymore; I'm talking about Dad.

30:42.304 --> 30:44.264
- Know what? That's it. You're done.
- What?

30:44.267 --> 30:45.553
What's your problem?!

30:45.554 --> 30:47.173
Nothing!

30:47.174 --> 30:48.923
(dishes clattering)

30:48.924 --> 30:50.554
Get out while you can, dude.

31:04.304 --> 31:05.553
Okay.

31:05.554 --> 31:08.013
What's going on?

31:08.014 --> 31:11.133
(sniffles) I just really
wanted tonight to be nice.

31:11.134 --> 31:14.133
And my parents couldn't be here.

31:14.134 --> 31:15.223
Which is understandable.

31:15.224 --> 31:16.463
My brother's being a jerk.

31:16.464 --> 31:17.843
He's being fine.

31:17.844 --> 31:20.053
And I messed up the risotto.

31:20.054 --> 31:22.263
Yeah, that's true, but...

31:22.264 --> 31:24.264
that doesn't explain it.

31:26.764 --> 31:28.384
Tell me.

31:36.634 --> 31:39.423
Your dad... he's sick?

31:39.424 --> 31:41.424
Is that it?

31:43.424 --> 31:45.344
Uh, no, he's fine now.

31:50.764 --> 31:53.674
He had, um... he had
radiation poisoning.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.264
He was at the bomb blast?

31:58.724 --> 32:00.383
Yeah.

32:00.384 --> 32:03.883
So was Jason and Alison.

32:03.884 --> 32:06.464
So was I.

32:08.304 --> 32:09.844
Why didn't you tell me?

32:12.514 --> 32:16.423
The truth is, I...

32:16.424 --> 32:17.883
I don't know.

32:17.884 --> 32:21.093
As long as I was worrying about
how everyone else was feeling,

32:21.094 --> 32:23.963
I didn't... I didn't have to
think about how I was feeling.

32:23.964 --> 32:25.964
And it's just hitting me all at once.

32:27.764 --> 32:30.633
And part of me...

32:30.634 --> 32:32.513
thinks if I don't talk about it,

32:32.514 --> 32:34.883
then I don't have to deal with it.

32:34.884 --> 32:38.553
Which I've had enough
psychology to know isn't true.

32:38.554 --> 32:40.303
I'll probably just develop, uh,

32:40.304 --> 32:42.303
a tic or a skin condition or something.

32:42.304 --> 32:44.593
Serious drug habit.

32:44.594 --> 32:46.383
Can't rule out kleptomania.

32:46.384 --> 32:47.763
(laughs)

32:47.764 --> 32:49.883
Ah, see.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.513
That is the problem.

32:51.514 --> 32:53.923
You're fun.

32:53.924 --> 32:55.513
We're fun and...

32:55.514 --> 32:57.134
Yeah.

32:59.964 --> 33:03.161
This thing that happened
to me is just so not fun.

33:05.724 --> 33:08.263
It's just, all of a
sudden, everything is...

33:08.264 --> 33:10.133
it's dark and serious because of me.

33:10.134 --> 33:13.133
No. No.

33:13.134 --> 33:15.263
Because of some lunatic with a bomb.

33:15.264 --> 33:17.514
Will be fun again, I promise.

33:19.924 --> 33:23.093
I mean, maybe not with me,
but someone will come along.

33:23.094 --> 33:25.263
(laughs)

33:25.264 --> 33:27.963
DAISY: This girl was forced
to marry an HS fighter

33:27.964 --> 33:29.673
who raped her every
night until she escaped

33:29.674 --> 33:31.013
with her newborn daughter.

33:31.014 --> 33:32.723
BLAKE: Then she handed
over all her money

33:32.724 --> 33:36.633
and climbed onto some criminal's
leaky boat with her child.

33:36.634 --> 33:37.803
Just to get away.

33:37.804 --> 33:39.553
Each one of these files is a life.

33:39.554 --> 33:41.355
And this is just one boat.

33:41.356 --> 33:43.553
And yet, almost every one of them says

33:43.554 --> 33:46.223
that if it were possible,
they'd stay in Libya.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.134
It's home.

33:48.384 --> 33:49.673
(Elizabeth sighs)

33:49.674 --> 33:50.803
Sit. Sit.

33:50.804 --> 33:53.093
We were sorry to hear about

33:53.094 --> 33:54.223
the op in Libya.

33:54.224 --> 33:55.633
You have our condolences.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.383
It wasn't the outcome
anyone had hoped for.

33:59.384 --> 34:01.263
But we still have work.

34:01.264 --> 34:04.263
Now we can transfer the
refugees off our ship

34:04.264 --> 34:06.843
into Camp Blickstein in New
Mexico for processing.

34:06.844 --> 34:08.263
(sighs)

34:08.264 --> 34:09.463
After everything they've been through,

34:09.464 --> 34:11.842
these people deserve some stability.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.723
Unfortunately, starting
interdepartmental vetting

34:14.724 --> 34:16.592
opens them to scrutiny.

34:16.594 --> 34:18.303
JAY: And you can believe Senator Morejon

34:18.304 --> 34:19.286
will stoke the flames.

34:19.288 --> 34:21.422
Well, even if he passed
a bill to block them,

34:21.424 --> 34:22.422
Dalton would veto it.

34:22.424 --> 34:23.963
So we are full steam ahead.

34:23.964 --> 34:25.263
Nadine, make this a priority.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.815
- Yeah.
- These people matter,

34:26.815 --> 34:29.304
and they're not going back.

34:34.764 --> 34:37.303
(shouting, explosion over computer)

34:37.304 --> 34:38.963
Hey.

34:38.964 --> 34:41.342
Hey.

34:41.344 --> 34:43.092
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

34:43.094 --> 34:45.132
Everybody's asleep.

34:45.134 --> 34:47.303
Any word on the Jareth dinner?

34:47.304 --> 34:48.303
No.

34:48.304 --> 34:50.342
How about you?

34:50.344 --> 34:51.763
I'm not tired.

34:51.764 --> 34:54.342
Henry, you're obsessing.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.963
You got to put it down

34:55.964 --> 34:57.263
for the night.

34:57.264 --> 34:59.923
(sighs)

34:59.924 --> 35:01.883
I've gone over Shamekh's files.

35:01.884 --> 35:06.593
I've thought about
this from every angle.

35:06.594 --> 35:09.463
And still, given everything,
I would make the same call.

35:09.464 --> 35:11.094
So what are you doing?

35:13.224 --> 35:15.383
Looking.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.133
For what we missed, I guess.

35:17.134 --> 35:19.633
(phone ringing)

35:19.634 --> 35:20.633
Hi, Russell.

35:20.634 --> 35:21.633
Any news?

35:21.634 --> 35:22.723
Are you with Elizabeth?

35:22.724 --> 35:23.739
Yeah, she's right here.

35:23.740 --> 35:24.633
Good.

35:24.634 --> 35:26.513
She'll want to hear this.

35:26.514 --> 35:28.343
Got something.

35:28.344 --> 35:29.052
(phone beeps)

35:29.053 --> 35:32.343
Forensics pieced
together Shamekh's vest.

35:32.344 --> 35:33.963
It was remotely detonated.

35:33.964 --> 35:37.133
Looks like they didn't trust him
to go through with the bombing.

35:37.134 --> 35:39.303
So he wasn't radicalized,
he was coerced.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.423
HS must have made him.

35:41.424 --> 35:43.463
They're still examining
the various recordings,

35:43.464 --> 35:45.223
trying to get a fuller picture,

35:45.224 --> 35:48.343
but I wanted you to know.

35:48.344 --> 35:50.303
Okay, thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.

35:50.304 --> 35:51.383
(phone beeps)

35:51.384 --> 35:53.673
They must have threatened his family.

35:53.674 --> 35:55.957
It was his only way out.

35:57.514 --> 35:58.853
(sighs)

36:00.304 --> 36:02.038
You heard him, babe.

36:03.134 --> 36:04.898
It's not on you.

36:05.924 --> 36:07.303
Yeah.

36:07.304 --> 36:08.513
Come on.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.779
Let's go to bed, okay?

36:11.804 --> 36:12.883
(groans)

36:12.884 --> 36:15.464
Uh... I'll be right up.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.264
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

36:29.054 --> 36:31.054
(shouting, explosion
over computer repeats)

36:38.824 --> 36:40.703
Morning, everybody.

36:40.704 --> 36:42.533
How's it going?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.323
Chemistry midterm?

36:44.324 --> 36:46.572
Ugh, my brain is turning to mush.

36:46.573 --> 36:47.363
(chuckles)

36:47.364 --> 36:50.212
I believe the term is
"catalytic conversion."

36:50.213 --> 36:51.882
Not for her. It's called stasis.

36:51.883 --> 36:54.284
And look at that.
Everything's back to normal.

36:54.285 --> 36:56.454
These two are bickering,
this one's not speaking to us.

36:56.455 --> 36:58.034
Well, she has a point.

36:58.035 --> 36:59.374
No, I'm not mad at you guys.

36:59.375 --> 37:00.790
I'm too busy beating myself up.

37:00.791 --> 37:02.204
For what?

37:02.205 --> 37:03.863
Cooking a bowl of slop
and acting like a freak?

37:03.888 --> 37:04.415
Jason.

37:04.418 --> 37:05.375
He's right.

37:05.376 --> 37:06.335
I'm sure you didn't.

37:09.835 --> 37:12.834
You know what, tell him it was
our fault and invite him back,

37:12.835 --> 37:13.954
and we'll order in.

37:13.955 --> 37:15.284
Everybody wins.

37:15.285 --> 37:17.414
I don't think we have to
worry about that happening.

37:17.415 --> 37:19.283
If he's smart, he's long gone.

37:19.284 --> 37:20.653
Dad, can you drive me to school?

37:20.654 --> 37:22.205
- I need to study in the car.
- Sure.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.874
(phone ringing)

37:23.875 --> 37:26.374
Hello.

37:26.375 --> 37:27.534
Okay.

37:27.535 --> 37:30.034
Yeah, send him in.
I think he knows the way.

37:30.035 --> 37:31.414
Well, he can't be that smart.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.414
(mouthing)

37:32.415 --> 37:34.415
What?

37:37.555 --> 37:38.753
Good morning.

37:39.202 --> 37:41.874
I come bearing delicacies
of my homeland.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.704
Oh, God, I hope you mean scones.

37:43.705 --> 37:45.244
Well, it's not bangers and mash.

37:45.245 --> 37:46.244
(laughs)

37:46.245 --> 37:48.124
Madam Secretary, hi.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.704
Dr. McCord, pleasure.

37:49.705 --> 37:51.284
I'm Jareth, like the David Bowie movie.

37:51.285 --> 37:52.744
Nice.

37:52.745 --> 37:54.074
Very nice to meet you.

37:54.075 --> 37:55.124
Welcome back.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.994
Uh, Jason I've met.

37:56.995 --> 37:57.994
You must be Alison.

37:57.995 --> 37:58.725
Hi.

37:58.726 --> 37:59.454
Hi.

37:59.455 --> 38:00.450
You must be hungry.

38:00.451 --> 38:01.507
(chuckles) Why?

38:01.508 --> 38:03.244
Because I cooked an inedible meal?

38:03.245 --> 38:06.061
Because it's the morning and
you cooked an inedible meal.

38:06.062 --> 38:07.625
- (laughs)
- Dad, we actually really have to go.

38:07.628 --> 38:09.149
- HENRY: Okay.
- Sorry, Jareth.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.954
Not at all. One for the road, please.

38:10.955 --> 38:11.975
(phone vibrating)

38:11.976 --> 38:12.994
Excuse me a minute.

38:12.995 --> 38:14.319
Hey, Nadine.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.559
Morejon wants to do what?

38:17.575 --> 38:19.443
(talking quietly)

38:19.444 --> 38:20.549
How much time?

38:21.922 --> 38:25.445
Um, tell the White House
I'm-I'm leaving now.

38:25.535 --> 38:28.744
Jareth, um, I really do look forward

38:28.745 --> 38:30.374
to getting to know you better.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.494
We have time.

38:31.495 --> 38:33.495
(mouthing)

38:35.285 --> 38:37.050
JACKSON: <i>Where does a junior senator</i>

38:37.051 --> 38:39.089
get the stones to sue the president?

38:39.090 --> 38:40.589
In a democracy, there is indeed

38:40.590 --> 38:43.020
a thing called checks and balances.

38:43.430 --> 38:46.339
The Justice Department tried to
have the injunction dismissed,

38:46.340 --> 38:49.929
but the presiding judge is dyed-
in-the-wool anti-immigration.

38:49.930 --> 38:51.429
And once Morejon files it,

38:51.430 --> 38:55.339
the refugee vetting process
will drag on even longer.

38:55.340 --> 38:58.509
And I hate to say it,
but a highly public court case

38:58.510 --> 39:01.089
would make holding onto
200 Libyan refugees

39:01.090 --> 39:02.469
politically untenable for you, sir.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.259
I didn't intend to take
responsibility for these people,

39:05.260 --> 39:07.629
but now that we have, I'm not
going to just send them back.

39:07.630 --> 39:08.629
Well, you're the president.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.630
Accepting refugees is your prerogative.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.049
ELIZABETH: Well, maybe we just

39:14.050 --> 39:18.049
have to remind the senator
from Arizona of that.

39:18.050 --> 39:19.070
(crowd cheering)

39:19.071 --> 39:20.089
Good morning, everybody!

39:20.090 --> 39:23.090
Yeah. Here it is.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.719
We're gonna do it.

39:27.720 --> 39:32.339
We're here to show you
that we mean business.

39:32.340 --> 39:34.340
(cameras clicking)

39:38.180 --> 39:39.838
Senator Morejon.

39:40.630 --> 39:43.389
I'm... whew... so glad I caught you.

39:43.390 --> 39:45.719
You won't silence me again.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.389
What I'm doing is legal.

39:47.390 --> 39:48.390
So is this.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.219
U.S. Refugee Act of 1980?

39:55.220 --> 39:56.509
Section 207.

39:56.510 --> 40:00.839
It gives the president authority
to admit refugees to the U.S.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.009
in emergency situations.

40:03.010 --> 40:04.389
Doesn't apply.

40:04.390 --> 40:06.760
My injunction is about
his executive order.

40:09.050 --> 40:10.049
True.

40:10.050 --> 40:14.009
You can still ban these

40:14.010 --> 40:17.470
243 refugees, specifically.

40:19.470 --> 40:24.089
But when the president pledged
to accept 20,000 Libyans,

40:24.090 --> 40:26.299
he also will have the authority

40:26.300 --> 40:30.259
to place them in any state he sees fit.

40:30.260 --> 40:33.549
For instance, they might
feel right at home

40:33.550 --> 40:36.799
in the dry desert climate
of your great state.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.930
- (sighs)
- And they'll have you to thank.

40:38.933 --> 40:42.629
Well, some of your constituents
might not see it that way.

40:42.630 --> 40:45.509
But then again,

40:45.510 --> 40:49.389
one of those young
refugees could grow up

40:49.390 --> 40:52.009
to become a United States senator.

40:52.010 --> 40:55.130
And isn't that what
America's all about?

40:58.180 --> 41:00.219
You have a great day...

41:00.220 --> 41:02.219
Senator.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.220
(cameras clicking, reporters murmuring)

41:08.430 --> 41:11.339
Oh, babe.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.429
Just bear with me, okay?

41:13.430 --> 41:15.509
I went back and looked
at the recordings

41:15.510 --> 41:16.929
that Russell mentioned, but this time,

41:16.930 --> 41:18.339
I knew that Shamekh was coerced.

41:18.340 --> 41:19.469
I think I found something.

41:19.470 --> 41:22.259
Here.

41:22.260 --> 41:25.259
In this, Shamekh is
running towards camera,

41:25.260 --> 41:26.509
so the audio's better.

41:26.510 --> 41:28.509
You speak Arabic,

41:28.510 --> 41:30.889
so listen to this and
tell me if I'm crazy

41:30.890 --> 41:33.889
or is this guy using his
last moment on Earth

41:33.890 --> 41:35.129
to tell us something.

41:35.130 --> 41:36.130
(taps keyboard)

41:38.680 --> 41:40.160
(shouting, explosion over headphones)

41:42.510 --> 41:45.219
ELIZABETH: <i>He says "Hijriyyah."
It's a woman's name.</i>

41:45.220 --> 41:47.622
- So he called for his mommy. How
does that help us? - ELIZABETH: No.

41:47.623 --> 41:50.389
No one in Shamekh's family
or affiliates has that name.

41:50.390 --> 41:51.929
Fine then, it's his favorite sled.

41:51.930 --> 41:53.629
It means something.

41:53.630 --> 41:57.129
It is a very specific,
highly unusual name in Arabic.

41:57.130 --> 41:57.839
He's right.

41:57.840 --> 41:58.799
In fact,

41:58.800 --> 42:00.390
I came across it last night.

42:02.930 --> 42:05.629
Idris Al Bouri...

42:05.630 --> 42:08.339
the warlord.

42:08.340 --> 42:11.339
And his daughter...

42:11.340 --> 42:12.390
Hijriyyah.

42:13.390 --> 42:15.469
Al Bouri announced his allegiance

42:15.470 --> 42:17.969
the day before our mechanic
says he saw Jibral Disah.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.389
And his wife. But he only got

42:19.390 --> 42:21.078
a glimpse of her hand, red with clay.

42:21.079 --> 42:24.273
Or-or henna, a traditional
Muslim bridal ritual.

42:24.274 --> 42:25.889
She wasn't one of Jibral Disah's

42:25.890 --> 42:27.333
existing wives.

42:27.334 --> 42:28.882
She was his new bride.

42:28.883 --> 42:31.469
So Al Bouri gives her
up to Jibral Disah?

42:31.470 --> 42:33.089
Not gives, betroths.

42:33.090 --> 42:35.219
An insurance policy by allying himself

42:35.220 --> 42:36.299
with Disah through blood.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.339
Well, why didn't we know about it?

42:37.340 --> 42:38.299
Why the big secret?

42:38.300 --> 42:39.929
Okay, you're the most
wanted man in the world.

42:39.930 --> 42:41.429
You're hunted down like an animal,

42:41.430 --> 42:43.759
yet you take on a new
young bride anyway?

42:43.760 --> 42:45.509
But you keep it a secret...

42:45.510 --> 42:48.470
Because she is actually
important to him.

42:50.510 --> 42:52.846
That's a weakness we can exploit.

42:54.090 --> 42:57.759
So we find the third wife,
and sooner or later...

42:59.090 --> 43:01.339
...we find the enemy.

43:01.340 --> 43:08.169
