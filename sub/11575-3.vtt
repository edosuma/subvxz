WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:07.834
Argh!

00:08.509 --> 00:09.965
Some guys just can't
take "no" for an answer.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.084
The Morrigan
wants that photo!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.428
Oh, I can't blame her.
Have you seen it?

00:14.682 --> 00:15.091
Awkward!

00:15.349 --> 00:16.555
Ahh!

00:16.809 --> 00:17.639
[Thud]

00:20.021 --> 00:20.555
[Whack]

00:22.565 --> 00:23.099
[Whack]

00:24.317 --> 00:26.308
[Laughing]

00:26.569 --> 00:29.527
Kenzi for the assist!
Yes!

00:29.822 --> 00:31.562
Did you like that part?
Where I pretended

00:31.824 --> 00:34.065
to fall on my ass when
actually I was like

00:34.327 --> 00:35.612
a stealth missile
lasering in on target.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.484
Smooth.
Remind me

00:36.746 --> 00:38.862
to book you on
"Dancing With The Fae".

00:39.123 --> 00:39.782
Is that a thing?

00:40.041 --> 00:41.531
Just help me drag
tall, dark and hideous

00:41.792 --> 00:42.542
out of sight, okay?

00:42.793 --> 00:44.579
You know,
far be it from me

00:44.837 --> 00:46.168
to be a Wendy Whiner...

00:46.422 --> 00:47.172
Totally.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.914
But this is the third
Faebag attack this week.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.165
Your point, Wendy?

00:51.427 --> 00:53.383
Yesterday it was the
two-headed thingie

00:53.638 --> 00:54.343
that looked like Regis.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.383
Then before that
it was that hotdog vendor

00:56.641 --> 00:58.381
that turned out to be
a fire-breathing...?

00:58.643 --> 00:59.507
I wanna say, frog?

00:59.769 --> 01:00.474
Jellyfish?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.889
Whatever it was, we
kicked its gelatinous ass.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.604
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

01:05.858 --> 01:08.565
but I'm only human, Bo.
And, no offense,

01:08.819 --> 01:10.480
but you ain't lookin'
so chipper either.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.400
Hey, whatever The Morrigan
dishes out, I can handle it.

01:13.658 --> 01:16.070
You still got that doozie
from yesterday's slug fest?

01:16.327 --> 01:17.567
Yesterday it
was a cut.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.568
Today it is a bruise.
l'm healing.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.366
Slowly.
Very slowly.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.409
What are you saying?

01:22.667 --> 01:23.372
The doc...

01:23.626 --> 01:24.411
I mean...

01:24.669 --> 01:26.910
You know, isn't it like
trying to charge an iPad

01:27.171 --> 01:27.921
with a hamster wheel?

01:28.172 --> 01:29.537
Okay, time out.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.585
What exactly do you
have against Lauren?

01:31.842 --> 01:32.467
Moi?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.549
Oh, come on, Kenzi,
with the little digs

01:34.804 --> 01:36.260
and the rolling
of the eyes...

01:36.514 --> 01:37.845
I'm not stupid.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.339
Well...

01:39.600 --> 01:40.635
Here's your chance,
while I'm still high

01:40.893 --> 01:43.225
off my wicked moves.
Get it out of your system!

01:43.479 --> 01:46.971
She is bossy, territorial,
and controlling.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.565
She thinks you're immature,
irresponsible and clingy.

01:49.819 --> 01:50.478
She does?!

01:50.736 --> 01:52.522
Oh, you've said those
things about yourself.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.941
Yeah, but when I say it,
it is adorable.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.406
Okay, the point
is I love Lauren.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.366
She's a huge
part of my life.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.325
As are you.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.116
So in the Battle of BFF
versus Main Squeeze,

02:03.374 --> 02:05.410
I think it's time
we called a truce.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.124
Got it?

02:09.338 --> 02:09.713
Uh huh.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.250
Now, all those
on Team Bo...

02:12.800 --> 02:14.381
Drinks are on me.

02:17.763 --> 02:18.218
[Whack]

02:19.807 --> 02:21.138
That's right.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.217
Oh, Bruce...
you disappoint me.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.058
l'm Steve--

02:25.313 --> 02:26.302
How did this happen?

02:26.564 --> 02:29.431
It's not my fault,
she had an army.

02:29.692 --> 02:31.228
Don't insult
my intelligence!

02:31.485 --> 02:33.396
You're a worse liar than
your brother, Eric.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.404
Dave.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.485
I don't care!

02:35.740 --> 02:37.230
|f| hadn't just
had my nails done,

02:37.491 --> 02:39.482
l'd rip your
beating heart out myself.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.109
You're too kind.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.203
I think someone's
getting a little too big

02:49.462 --> 02:51.418
for her leather britches.

02:51.672 --> 02:57.258
[Rustling]

02:57.511 --> 03:00.878
Soon, my pet...
soon.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.556
|f Li'l Bo Bleep thinks she
can play in the big leagues...

03:11.817 --> 03:13.808
let the games begin.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.230
Life is hard when
you don't know who you are.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.237
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.615
My love carries
a death sentence.

03:25.873 --> 03:30.492
l was lost for years,
searching while hiding.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.870
Only to find that l belonged
to a world hidden from humans.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.455
I won't hide anymore.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.094
I will live
the life I choose.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.517
EKG, MRI, EMV...

03:48.771 --> 03:51.308
Wake me up
when you get to S&M.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.431
See, the truth of it,
Vex, is that--

03:54.693 --> 03:56.308
No, don't
sugar coat it, doc.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.561
Just give it
to me straight.

03:58.823 --> 03:59.608
Okay.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.776
There is nothing physically
wrong with your arm,

04:02.034 --> 04:04.821
or your nervous system, or
your musculoskeletal system--

04:05.830 --> 04:07.445
Then”.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.446
why... can't |--

04:09.708 --> 04:10.572
Get it up?

04:10.835 --> 04:12.075
Oh, regular riot,
you are.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.746
Since there's no
physiological reason

04:14.004 --> 04:14.754
for your
mesmeric impotence--

04:15.005 --> 04:16.620
Aha!
I made you do that!

04:17.341 --> 04:18.751
No, actually,
that was just an itch.

04:19.009 --> 04:19.759
Damn you!

04:20.010 --> 04:22.296
What I'm trying to say is
that your "condition"

04:22.555 --> 04:25.092
may be psychological
in nature.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.759
What, you sayin'
l'm whacked?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.599
Like I'm a nutter? A few
ounces short of a pint?

04:29.854 --> 04:32.140
It's not at all uncommon
in Fae your age.

04:32.398 --> 04:35.515
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

04:35.860 --> 04:40.524
You shall feel
the wrath of Vex!

04:44.368 --> 04:45.357
Bah!

04:45.619 --> 04:47.450
Why aren't you strangling
yourself by now?!

04:47.705 --> 04:48.820
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.287
I actually have
the pamphlet--

04:50.541 --> 04:52.577
Oh, save your pathetic
bedside manner

04:52.835 --> 04:56.578
for your new, presumably
temporary, girlfriend!

04:56.839 --> 04:57.624
Excuse me?

04:57.882 --> 04:59.622
Oh, come on--
It can't be easy

04:59.884 --> 05:02.296
keepin' up with the
Energizer SuccuBunny.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.633
Though Dyson could.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.753
Okay. You know what?
I think we're done.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.630
Any chance of
a prescription refill?

05:07.892 --> 05:08.506
Out!

05:09.518 --> 05:10.473
ReaHy?

05:15.733 --> 05:17.269
Bloody physicians.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.438
I mean, imagine sayin' that
there's nothing wrong with it.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.732
I mean, have you ever
heard anything so--

05:23.532 --> 05:25.944
Hello! Barkeep!
I'm talking to you!

05:26.827 --> 05:27.577
Still?

05:27.828 --> 05:28.533
Unbelievable!

05:28.787 --> 05:31.745
Here I am, pouring out
my heart to you and--

05:36.879 --> 05:38.415
Dyson, I'm not
here for my health.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.287
You wanna look at these
case files or not?

05:40.549 --> 05:42.585
Uh, absolutely.
Just gimme a sec--

05:42.843 --> 05:45.255
Ah...
Greetings.

05:45.888 --> 05:46.593
Don't even
start, Vex.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.597
I beg your pardon?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.463
I'm not buying you
another drink.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.261
Hey, I'm
deeply offended.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.759
Good, now go away.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.009
Hey, you
don't own me.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.056
Okay, look--

05:55.314 --> 05:57.305
We've been listening to
your same sad story for days.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.352
The Dark doesn't want me.
The Light can't stand me.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.475
My friends--
Oh, wait...

06:01.737 --> 06:02.772
He doesn't
have any, does he?

06:03.030 --> 06:03.815
Sucks to be Vex.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.904
This is an outrage!

06:06.200 --> 06:09.033
Nine ball...
side pocket.

06:22.925 --> 06:23.914
What is with
that chick?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.677
She's just not
feeling the love.

06:25.928 --> 06:26.508
But why?

06:26.762 --> 06:27.592
Because she thinks
you're a murderer?

06:27.846 --> 06:30.588
But more importantly,
what have you been up to?

06:30.849 --> 06:32.589
What?
Oh--

06:32.851 --> 06:33.431
The Morrigan again?

06:33.686 --> 06:34.550
Oh, piece of cake.

06:34.812 --> 06:35.927
Don't underestimate
that woman.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.303
After the Garuda
meltdown, the Light

06:37.565 --> 06:39.305
and the Dark have
agreed to play nice.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.852
Unaﬁgned
means unprotected.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.816
Oh, but you
are forgetting...

06:43.862 --> 06:45.898
l have this.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.072
My own little
insurance policy.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.782
I still think you should
talk to The Ash.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.776
You look like you
could use a break.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.619
And I'm guessing
Kenzi could, too.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.328
Oh!

06:55.583 --> 06:56.447
--[Clatter]
--Ow!

06:56.709 --> 06:57.789
Pardonez moi...

06:59.878 --> 07:00.537
What's his problem?

07:00.796 --> 07:02.127
l have no idea.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.417
You brought this
on yourself, you know.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.415
Is this how you
roll now? Tough love?

07:06.677 --> 07:07.541
You handcuffed
The Morrigan

07:07.803 --> 07:09.304
to her bed
for a Kodak moment.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.715
You sure this
has nothing to do

07:10.973 --> 07:12.929
with your Fae United
Nations experiment?

07:13.183 --> 07:15.925
A Light cop partnered
with a Dark cop? Really?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.518
lt's cynicism like that
has kept our sides

07:18.772 --> 07:20.308
from building
a genuine peace.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.682
Also, why do you care
who Dyson is paired with?

07:22.943 --> 07:23.898
I don't.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.484
Didn't think so.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.645
Know what might
help your situation?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.771
Just so happens
I had a declaration

07:30.034 --> 07:30.989
to the Light
all prepared...

07:31.243 --> 07:34.656
I'm not gonna be pressured into
choosing a side out of fear.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.494
Well, can't blame
an Ash for tryin'.

07:36.749 --> 07:38.364
You know what?
Forget it.

07:38.751 --> 07:39.581
I can handle
the shitstorm,

07:39.835 --> 07:42.417
it's just that Kenzi is
starting to feel the strain.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.536
Now who's dishing
outtoughlove?

07:45.924 --> 07:47.380
Bo, hang on...

07:49.928 --> 07:51.429
Look, since we got
all Garuda-fied,

07:51.680 --> 07:53.966
I've been doing some serious
inventory of the archives.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.009
And...?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.474
Seems someone has grabbed
my Staff of Righteousness.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.844
The Staff is
a piece of wood...

08:00.606 --> 08:03.769
a treasured ceremonial relic
and very powerful.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.607
Currently believed
to be in the possession

08:05.861 --> 08:07.317
of one
Mortimer Fassbinder.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.651
Pawnbroker
and sleazebag.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.487
So, if I bring you
this Staff...

08:10.741 --> 08:12.948
I could probably post a
security detail near your place.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.614
Keep an eye out
for The Morrigan's pets.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.327
Where do | find
this Fassbinder?

08:17.581 --> 08:18.821
Hold up, Slick.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.117
There's something you
should know about the Staff.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.964
VEX: Cheers, Bruce!

08:30.219 --> 08:32.926
Lovely lady,
it is your lucky day.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.671
I could have you killed just
for crossing my threshold.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.798
Tut tut, bygones
and all that...

08:38.060 --> 08:41.644
A heartfelt expression
of my loyalty to the Dark.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.932
And you.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.820
I am beautiful
in restraints.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.027
Delete.

08:56.912 --> 08:57.822
Was there
something else?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.661
Well, I thought
you'd be pleased.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.372
If you really wanted
to please me you would have

09:02.626 --> 09:04.287
brought me that bitch's
head on a platter.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.284
But... but, |--

09:05.546 --> 09:08.663
But maybe your recent
bout of impotence

09:08.924 --> 09:10.630
has spread
to your spine?

09:10.884 --> 09:15.753
Lucky for you, my pity
outweighs my disgust.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.005
I won't
have you killed.

09:18.851 --> 09:19.886
At least not today.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.146
Oh...
You're too kind.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.267
We all have
our cross to bear.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.606
Now drink up and go.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.565
The next time
we meet...

09:33.574 --> 09:35.656
...either you or Bo
will be dead.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.865
The choice is yours.

09:45.878 --> 09:46.833
Hey.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.120
Oh, hey.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.882
Whatcha doin'?

09:51.216 --> 09:54.253
Oh, you know,
just some Doctor-y stuff.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.302
You know, I am actually
interested in your work.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.888
You can talk to me about
whatever it is you do.

10:00.142 --> 10:00.767
ReaHy?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.758
You want to hear about
my latest monograph

10:03.020 --> 10:03.930
regarding the rhizome
repellent gradient

10:04.188 --> 10:05.769
of Fae blood compared
with human blood,

10:06.023 --> 10:08.856
especially when suspended
in an isotonic solution?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.142
Or we could go
to a movie.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.188
Okay.

10:13.405 --> 10:13.985
What is that?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.024
Oh--

10:16.909 --> 10:19.321
The Staff
of Righteousness.

10:19.745 --> 10:20.825
The who of what?

10:21.079 --> 10:21.989
Don't ask.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.862
Oh, and don't touch.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.664
Well...

10:26.919 --> 10:28.625
what can I touch?

10:30.005 --> 10:31.961
Ha, ha,
very funny.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.512
What's gotten
into you?

10:40.766 --> 10:41.846
Well, you know,
nothing just yet.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.012
But I was kinda thinking
maybe we could, um...

10:46.939 --> 10:47.849
[Laughing]
Oh...

10:48.106 --> 10:49.812
Wow... and to think
| just came by

10:50.067 --> 10:51.898
to see if I left
my phone here.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.653
Hm...
I don't know.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.360
Let's look...

10:55.906 --> 10:57.942
Well, it's not
in there.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.614
Gosh, you know,

10:59.868 --> 11:02.530
with any luck maybe
you left it on "vibrate".

11:02.788 --> 11:04.904
I thought you'd be too
tired after last night.

11:05.165 --> 11:05.824
Thed?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.699
lam going for the gold
in the Succu-games.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.542
[Laughing]

11:10.796 --> 11:11.660
Well...

11:11.922 --> 11:13.628
I don't know
what's gotten into you,

11:13.882 --> 11:16.168
but far be it from me
to stand in the way

11:16.426 --> 11:19.088
of a young
athlete's dream.

11:26.019 --> 11:26.929
Yo, V-man.

11:27.187 --> 11:27.972
Whatever.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.061
Sounds like somebody woke
up on the wrong side

11:30.315 --> 11:31.646
of the pull-out
couch this morning.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.015
What's up?

11:33.902 --> 11:34.982
It's my arm.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.523
Again with
the pity parade?

11:37.781 --> 11:39.817
Look, you got a busted
wing, you can't fly.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.861
You gotta walk around
like the rest of us

11:42.119 --> 11:43.154
poor miserable humans.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.528
Welcome
to Kenzi-ville! Man!

11:45.789 --> 11:47.450
Now you know what it's
like to be surrounded

11:47.708 --> 11:49.164
by superheroes
every day.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.658
Suck it up,
Pathetico!

11:50.919 --> 11:51.874
You know,
if I were you,

11:52.129 --> 11:55.166
l'd re-consider a career
in social work.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.630
Can we just--

11:56.884 --> 11:58.795
Forget about your Fae-self
for like a nanosecond,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.838
and talk about something
that's really important?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.131
Doubtful.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.720
Mascara.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.016
You have my attention.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.054
Dude, your lashes
are freakin' amazing!

12:08.395 --> 12:10.010
Yeah... it's all in
the brush technique.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.728
Wait.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.098
I picked up a few
tips from Da Vinci.

12:14.359 --> 12:14.984
As in The Code?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.567
Oh, yeah, now there
was a queen for ya.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.903
He was all over David's
ass like curry on chips.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.693
Can you help me
with my clumping?

12:21.950 --> 12:22.700
Oh, please...

12:22.951 --> 12:23.736
BO: Hey, ya'll.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.279
Hey!
Whazat?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.819
The end of a long
story, involving

12:28.081 --> 12:30.663
a greasy pawnbroker and
some hardcore negotiating.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.000
VEX: Uh, do you mind?
We're working over here.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.003
Anyone seen
my phone?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.835
You say phone?
What, your phone?

12:36.089 --> 12:36.919
[Sigh]

12:37.174 --> 12:39.916
Here, shift a cheek so I can
look under the cushions.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.347
Nothing...

12:44.890 --> 12:45.675
Scootch!

12:45.933 --> 12:46.797
Where'd you
last have it?

12:47.059 --> 12:47.764
That's the thing--

12:48.018 --> 12:49.303
l coulda sworn
that I left it--

12:49.561 --> 12:50.971
Yeah, iPads, iPhones
electricity--

12:51.229 --> 12:52.765
It's all just
a fad, really.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.183
The future's analog
and all that.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.851
l'm tellin' ya.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.654
Am I doing it right?

13:03.909 --> 13:04.819
Uh...

13:05.077 --> 13:06.317
Hm...
Just a little bit up--

13:06.578 --> 13:08.910
O.M.G.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.655
You guys are
so cute together.

13:11.917 --> 13:12.622
Ha!

13:12.876 --> 13:13.285
Huh.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.501
| wish I had
a makeup buddy.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.836
I thought she
could be my friend,

13:19.091 --> 13:20.672
and she doesn't
even like me.

13:20.926 --> 13:21.335
Who?

13:21.593 --> 13:22.878
Tamsin!

13:23.428 --> 13:26.386
She is so
mean girl, right?

13:27.099 --> 13:29.010
I mean, buy an actual
personality already.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.349
Did you happen to rifle
through my duffel bag,

13:31.603 --> 13:33.389
and scarf down
a couple of yellow pills

13:33.647 --> 13:34.887
with tigers on 'em?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.226
I'm gonna talk
to Dyson.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.016
And Bee-Tee-Dubs--

13:40.278 --> 13:43.270
It is trés private.

13:44.992 --> 13:45.947
Private?

13:46.994 --> 13:50.031
[Singing] Lauren's pelt is
gonna be steamed!

13:50.288 --> 13:51.869
What's it with you
and the doc?

13:52.124 --> 13:53.830
I mean, besides her
terrible bedside manner

13:54.084 --> 13:56.370
and the fact that she's
a damn sight cleverer than you.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.209
Not to mention sneaky.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.873
She spy-banged Bo.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.997
Dyson's drop-kicked
Bo's heart ten times over,

14:02.259 --> 14:04.671
and you still howl
when he comes 'round.

14:06.096 --> 14:06.676
No!

14:09.391 --> 14:10.722
Listen, are
you gonna teach me

14:10.976 --> 14:13.683
the double pump smudge-proof
technique or not?

14:13.937 --> 14:14.687
[Sigh]

14:14.938 --> 14:16.098
I'm so proud of you.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.311
Come here.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.980
Alright, you're gonna move it
like this just at the ends.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.193
You can't--
Like shake it--

14:25.949 --> 14:27.735
I do not like
your friend.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.484
She's not my friend.
She is my new partner.

14:31.455 --> 14:32.695
What is she
saying about me?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.038
Because whatever
it is, it's not true.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.202
Have you been drinking?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.199
What?
Like, alcohol?

14:37.461 --> 14:38.041
[Laughing]

14:38.295 --> 14:39.455
| wish.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.665
Do you
have fake ID?

14:44.926 --> 14:45.881
What?

14:47.095 --> 14:49.006
Let's do it.

14:52.934 --> 14:53.684
Let's get faced!

14:53.935 --> 14:57.018
Okay, you are cut off.
I'm gonna talk to Trick.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.114
Wow, you're
so beautiful.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.945
[Laughing]

15:13.997 --> 15:15.328
I'm sorry--

15:15.999 --> 15:16.363
[Laughing]

15:16.625 --> 15:18.161
I gotta go.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.046
I think Dyson
likes me.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.009
Say what?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.469
Don't tell anyone this...

15:31.723 --> 15:34.465
But I think
I might kiss him!

15:48.406 --> 15:50.613
There's no pupil dilation...

15:51.409 --> 15:52.535
No concussion.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.076
I'm stumped.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.490
You have little specks
in your eyes

15:56.748 --> 15:57.783
that look like stars.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.497
Call me crazy,
but based on

15:59.751 --> 16:01.161
your little display
at the bar...

16:01.419 --> 16:03.000
I mean, I do know
that you and Dyson--

16:03.255 --> 16:04.711
Spill on aisle 3!
Spill on aisle 3!

16:04.965 --> 16:05.795
Ow, ow--

16:06.049 --> 16:07.334
Come on!
Let's go to a movie.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.049
Wow, you're really hot.
Have you ever kissed a girl?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.136
I need you to sit still
to check your EKG, okay?

16:13.390 --> 16:13.799
Bzzz!

16:14.057 --> 16:14.807
Bo, stop!

16:15.058 --> 16:17.094
We have now
swapped brains.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.013
Hi, I'm Dr. Lauren.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.977
I don't like to
have any fun.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.267
Take two frownie brownies
and call me in the morning.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.981
You're really
starting to scare me.

16:25.235 --> 16:25.599
Rawr!

16:25.861 --> 16:27.067
--Okay. Just listen to me.
--Rawr!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.150
Bo! Bo! Listen to me!

16:28.405 --> 16:31.067
Have you come in contact
with any strange Fae lately--

16:31.324 --> 16:32.154
This is so lame!

16:32.409 --> 16:33.273
Bo! Please!

16:33.535 --> 16:35.821
Okay, well--

16:36.079 --> 16:40.994
There was this one gross
guy with a magic stick...

16:42.919 --> 16:45.877
[Laughing]

16:48.341 --> 16:49.251
Hey, Tammers.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.465
T-sin.
Officer "Slamsin"!

16:52.345 --> 16:53.721
Okay...

16:53.972 --> 16:55.087
Are you playin'
with yourself?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.088
Did somebody spike
your brewski?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.214
Dude.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.012
This one time?
That totally happened.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.806
I got to be Kenzi.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.269
Nailed it.

17:05.066 --> 17:05.725
Right.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.394
If you're trying to
throw me off my game

17:07.652 --> 17:09.608
before we get down,
it's working.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.072
Do you think
Bo likes me?

17:14.326 --> 17:15.566
Do I look
like I care?

17:15.827 --> 17:18.068
I think I'm gonna
ask her on a date.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.116
Okay, well...
Knock yourself out.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.624
In the meantime...

17:21.875 --> 17:24.287
You're either
in the game...

17:24.544 --> 17:29.083
or you are
in my way...

17:29.507 --> 17:31.998
You are so badass.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.723
[Singing] Bo and Dyson
sitting in a tree!

17:40.977 --> 17:41.887
Shh!

17:42.145 --> 17:44.181
[Singing]
K-i-s-s-i-n-g!

17:44.439 --> 17:45.474
Oh, that would
be so awesome!

17:45.732 --> 17:48.474
But, shhh!
People are listening.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.028
Hey, Gramps,
what's this?

17:54.449 --> 17:54.983
Seventh century.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.028
Please, put it back
in my study.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.149
Ew, she's gross.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.662
Just put it back.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.198
[Mocking]
"Put it back."

18:01.456 --> 18:02.821
Can I have
the car keys?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.789
No.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.954
If I don't get
the car keys,

18:07.212 --> 18:09.123
I'm gonna count
to a hundred.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.245
In French.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.247
[Laughing]
Good grief...

18:12.509 --> 18:13.089
See what I mean?

18:13.343 --> 18:14.173
Un.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.342
Deux!

18:18.348 --> 18:20.088
Trois...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.099
You think this is
being caused by

18:23.353 --> 18:25.139
the job that
The Ash sent her on?

18:25.397 --> 18:26.307
BO: Quatre...

18:26.564 --> 18:27.314
You tell me.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.396
Quatre.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.187
Can the Staff of Righteousness
have symptoms like these?

18:31.444 --> 18:32.194
BO: Quatre!

18:32.445 --> 18:32.979
Cinq!

18:33.238 --> 18:35.149
For the love
of Aphrodite, it's cinq!

18:35.407 --> 18:37.147
Sorry, French Police.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.491
Cinq.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.245
Six...

18:41.496 --> 18:43.236
At first glance, there's
nothing in the lore

18:43.498 --> 18:46.205
that suggest the Staff is
causing her symptoms.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.619
You have to admit, it's a
pretty strange coincidence.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.493
She goes looking for the
Staff and comes back like--

18:50.755 --> 18:51.289
PoHyanna
on mushrooms?

18:51.548 --> 18:51.912
Exactly.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.128
[Bar patrons cheering]

18:53.383 --> 18:54.213
Hey...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.048
--What?
--Where's "seven"?

19:05.729 --> 19:07.265
Bo, get down!

19:07.731 --> 19:09.016

"Don't you wish you're--"

19:09.274 --> 19:09.638
Hey!

19:09.899 --> 19:11.025
Let me finish!

19:11.276 --> 19:12.436
Don't Kanye me.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.438
DYSON:
You are a cheater!

19:14.696 --> 19:15.446
TAMSIN:
Whatever!

19:15.697 --> 19:17.779
You're a cheater.
And you're getting a zit.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.319
Bo is right.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.322
You're mean!

19:25.540 --> 19:28.907
Whatever this thing is...
it's contagious.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.668
You gotta forget
about brown.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.255
Black is always
the new black.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.542
You can't ground us.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.009
Yeah.
You're not our Mom.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.094
Yeah, we don't even have
to listen to you.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.135
So... Bo shagged
them both daft?

19:44.392 --> 19:45.427
We have a situation.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.346
More like
a shituation.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.559
You guys wanna
see my room?

19:48.813 --> 19:50.189
Uh... yeah!

19:50.440 --> 19:51.771
--Shotgun!
--No! No!

19:52.025 --> 19:53.390
No, wait!
Wait!

19:56.446 --> 19:57.151
Something's
made them sick.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.485
And what's
worse is the--

19:58.740 --> 20:04.201
[Snorting]

20:04.454 --> 20:06.035
--Is that--?
--A pig?

20:06.289 --> 20:07.324
[Snorting]

20:07.582 --> 20:09.538
He's looking
for something.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.658
KENZI:
Or someone!

20:11.920 --> 20:12.909
Bo.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.126
Kenzi, where
is there a knife?

20:14.381 --> 20:15.496
Or your trunk?

20:15.757 --> 20:16.462
Uh, upstairs!

20:16.716 --> 20:17.922
Well, what
about your sword?

20:18.176 --> 20:18.540
Upstairs!

20:18.802 --> 20:20.167
Okay, well, Kenzi,
think of something!

20:20.428 --> 20:22.840
That's usually
your thing, Doc!

20:23.098 --> 20:25.965
This little piggy's about
to go to market!

20:26.434 --> 20:27.719
[Snorting]

20:28.978 --> 20:32.721
[Snorting / growling]

20:32.982 --> 20:40.070
[Struggling]

20:40.323 --> 20:43.065
We need a weapon!
We need something!

20:43.451 --> 20:44.440
Whoa!

20:44.702 --> 20:45.657
Rawr!

20:47.038 --> 20:47.993
[Whack]

20:49.707 --> 20:50.662
[Whack]

20:51.418 --> 20:52.373
[Thud]

20:53.420 --> 20:54.500
Bloody hell...

20:56.381 --> 20:57.871
That'll do, pig...

20:58.133 --> 20:59.794
That'll do.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.166
How did you...

21:06.391 --> 21:08.507
Aren't you
the dark horse.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.649
He's dead.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.110
Dudes, all I did was
pick up this stupid shillelagh

21:21.364 --> 21:24.731
and all of a sudden
l'm Darth Vader.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.407
Let me see that.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.821
Yeah, about that...

21:28.079 --> 21:29.319
the shaft is kinda--

21:29.581 --> 21:31.788
Fae-zy Glued
to my hand.

21:32.041 --> 21:32.951
Yeah...

21:33.209 --> 21:34.289
That happened
to me once.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.409
Painful.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.255
"Grab a weapon,"
she said.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.167
It seems to be
an energy bond.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.179
So un-bond it.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.385
I can't.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.842
The wood is melded
to your flesh.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.216
Worst hand job ever.

21:51.769 --> 21:52.758
Whoa, Mack!
The knife?!

21:53.021 --> 21:55.558
No, I saw it on TV.
It cuts right through wood.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.225
And tomatoes.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.439
[Whack]

22:00.612 --> 22:01.818
Not my bad.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.777
Stick bad.

22:05.742 --> 22:06.652
Plus...

22:06.910 --> 22:08.741
Your music sucks!

22:09.078 --> 22:11.660
I bought
that one ironically.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.155
All of them, actually--

22:13.416 --> 22:15.657
Um, what the heck
is this?

22:15.919 --> 22:17.625
Oh!
Look at that!

22:17.879 --> 22:19.835
What is with your voice?
It's all Scottish-y.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.625
Oh!
Well, do you like it?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.214
--TAMSIN: It's lame.
--No.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.675
KENZI: Yo, peeps!
We are under attack!

22:25.929 --> 22:27.885
Big whoop.

22:28.139 --> 22:28.798
Fascinating.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.888
They seem to be immune
to any sense of danger.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.098
Oh, for god's sakes-- Hey!

22:33.353 --> 22:36.220
We have a dead man-pig
in the living room,

22:36.481 --> 22:38.312
l have a tree stuck
to my mitt,

22:38.566 --> 22:40.682
and I did not sign up
for the babysitter's club!

22:40.944 --> 22:43.230
[Laughing]
Oh, Dyson touched my boob!

22:43.488 --> 22:45.228
That was an accident!
It was with my elbow!

22:45.490 --> 22:46.479
Doesn't even count!
Come on!

22:46.741 --> 22:47.366
Seriously?

22:47.617 --> 22:49.824
TAMSIN: Guys, guys, guys!
Let's order pizza!

22:50.078 --> 22:50.863
Yes.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.202
For some reason, only the
3 of them are infected.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.366
Let's not take any chances.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.831
No physical contact until
I know what we're dealing with.

22:57.085 --> 22:57.414
Got it.

22:57.669 --> 22:58.829
Double cheese!
Yeah!

22:59.170 --> 23:00.376
Double cheese!

23:00.755 --> 23:01.335
Pizza!

23:01.589 --> 23:02.169
Pizza!

23:02.423 --> 23:02.878
Pizza!

23:03.132 --> 23:04.668
And you three,
stay put.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.336
BO:
Get the pizza!

23:06.594 --> 23:09.006
Where did you
get these?

23:10.056 --> 23:10.841
It's fantastic!

23:11.099 --> 23:12.509
--Give it to me.
--Tota||y lame...

23:12.767 --> 23:14.223
Aww--
There's another one!

23:14.477 --> 23:15.592
Come here, you!

23:16.104 --> 23:17.219
What I don't
understand is

23:17.480 --> 23:19.220
that if this disease
only targets Fae--

23:19.482 --> 23:20.722
Why isn't
Vex infected?

23:20.984 --> 23:23.270
Well, perhaps my
superior genetic makeup

23:23.528 --> 23:26.861
has rendered me immune
to embarrassing afflictions.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.400
What is that?

23:28.950 --> 23:29.905
What?

23:30.827 --> 23:33.819
You have a strange pustule
behind your ear

23:34.080 --> 23:36.446
that wasn't there when
I examined you last.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.790
Pustule. Ew.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.545
KENZI: Ugh...

23:44.799 --> 23:45.959
Ugh! Ugh!

23:46.217 --> 23:48.208
Ew with a double
side of hurl.

23:48.469 --> 23:49.333
What is it?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.837
It's what's left
of a cocoon.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.679
You've been used
as an incubator.

23:53.933 --> 23:54.683
By what?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.344
My guess?

23:56.603 --> 23:57.683
A parasite.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.723
What?
I'm unclean?!

23:59.981 --> 24:02.563
Relax.
It isn't in you anymore.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.773
But where could you
have picked this up?

24:05.528 --> 24:08.315
Have you been with
any strange Fae lately?

24:08.573 --> 24:10.313
Ugh.
Damn bitch!

24:10.575 --> 24:12.156
KENZI / LAUREN:
What's that?

24:12.410 --> 24:13.650
Oh, nothing, uh...

24:13.911 --> 24:16.823
l was just saying how devastated
l was about all this, uh--

24:17.081 --> 24:18.992
Listen, I'm gonna get
some help from Trick.

24:19.250 --> 24:19.784
Alright?

24:20.043 --> 24:22.409
I'm gonna make
things right. Alright?

24:28.259 --> 24:30.375
What the hell
did you do to me!?

24:30.762 --> 24:32.252
Used you
to spread a parasite.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.014
What kind
of bloody parasite!?

24:34.265 --> 24:35.550
The parasitic kind.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.682
Zaps its victims
with nymphoid hormones.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.551
Turns them into
self-obsessed brats

24:40.813 --> 24:42.394
too young
for Fae powers.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.560
So, they're completely
vulnerable to attack?

24:44.817 --> 24:45.852
Precisely.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.984
But what about
the "other white meat"?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.694
Relatives of yours?

24:50.948 --> 24:55.908
The infected emit a pungent
pheromone that attracts

24:56.162 --> 24:58.699
a nasty breed of UnderFae
in for the kill.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.867
Yeah, well, luckily
Kenzi pounded

25:01.125 --> 25:03.332
little Piggly Wiggly
into UnderFae bacon

25:03.586 --> 25:04.996
with her
magic shillelagh.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.004
And the Succubitch?

25:06.255 --> 25:07.711
Still alive
and singing.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.546
Along with
the other Twi-hards.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.087
Dyson and
his new partner.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.300
Oh!

25:13.846 --> 25:16.508
Now this is
getting interesting.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.552
Three of my
favorite people,

25:19.811 --> 25:21.517
trapped in one place...

25:21.771 --> 25:24.012
with no way
to defend themselves.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.140
And she's got
The Ash's play stick.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.108
You want to prove your
loyalty to the Dark?

25:34.951 --> 25:36.942
Finish off
the teen trio,

25:37.203 --> 25:40.536
and bring me the
Staff of Righteousness.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.620
And if I do?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.991
I'm sure I could find some...
entry level position--

25:45.253 --> 25:46.493
No!

25:46.754 --> 25:48.995
I want all titles restored--
a million in cash

25:49.257 --> 25:52.169
and my club.
I want it back.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.426
There's the Vex
I remember.

25:57.265 --> 26:00.348
"Grab a weapon",
she said...

26:00.601 --> 26:03.388
For the hundredth time,
Kenzi, I didn't know!

26:03.646 --> 26:05.056
Alert the media,
there is something

26:05.314 --> 26:06.770
Doctor Flawless
doesn't know!

26:08.526 --> 26:09.060
Course it isn't.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.728
'Cause that
would be "messy"!

26:10.987 --> 26:12.397
Do you think
just once!

26:12.655 --> 26:14.395
Maybe just once,
you could try to be--

26:14.657 --> 26:15.521
What? What?

26:15.783 --> 26:16.568
Helpful!

26:16.826 --> 26:17.576
Excuse me?

26:17.827 --> 26:18.577
Sure!

26:18.828 --> 26:20.284
Because
everybody else does!

26:20.538 --> 26:22.199
You just bounce
through life, no job,

26:22.457 --> 26:23.697
no plan, from
one beer to the next

26:23.958 --> 26:25.698
and still, everybody
dotes on you, don't they?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.461
What do you care
where they dote?

26:27.712 --> 26:28.542
Just forget about it.

26:28.796 --> 26:29.501
Yeah.
What is that?!

26:29.756 --> 26:31.792
Why are you always
rolling your eyes at me,

26:32.049 --> 26:34.711
with your normal upbringing
and your medical degree.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.880
You don't know anything
about my life, Kenzi!

26:37.138 --> 26:39.003
I know you think
you're too good for me.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.880
No, I don't actually!

26:41.142 --> 26:43.508
You think that I'm not
good enough for Bo!

26:49.025 --> 26:50.890
She's my best friend.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.150
And I love her.

26:53.404 --> 26:54.985
I know!

26:55.239 --> 26:57.400
[Sighing]
I know.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.152
Are you sure
we're not infected?

27:03.414 --> 27:04.369
Mm.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.247
No.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.995
We're just...

27:09.253 --> 27:10.584
...stupid.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.704
Well, I prefer...

27:13.966 --> 27:15.627
..."emotional".

27:21.265 --> 27:22.971
Moving on?

27:24.143 --> 27:24.928
Killer Pig?

27:25.186 --> 27:26.141
Yeah.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.934
Yep, okay.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.185
I can't believe I ever
thought you didn't like me.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.612
I don't think l was
supposed to like you.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.951
Why?
Whaddya mean?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.152
[Whispering]
I'm a Valkyrie.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.029
I think.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.371
Wow...

27:49.836 --> 27:50.791
ReaHy?

27:51.462 --> 27:53.123
What's a Valkyrie?

27:54.340 --> 27:55.295
I don't know.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.298
But...

27:58.553 --> 28:01.010
Sometimes when I like people,
l have to make them go away.

28:01.264 --> 28:02.720
What are you
talking about?

28:02.974 --> 28:04.589
Can you
keep a secret?

28:11.023 --> 28:12.308
Till I die.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.353
Um...

28:15.987 --> 28:17.443
No, I'm not
supposed to.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.358
No, wait!
Wait!

28:21.993 --> 28:23.028
l have an idea!

28:23.286 --> 28:24.742
Okay.

28:24.996 --> 28:30.741
Let's write down our
deepest, darkest secrets...

28:31.002 --> 28:32.367
in poetry.

28:32.962 --> 28:33.917
Cool!

28:34.922 --> 28:36.913
But like real poetry.
The kind that rhymes.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.212
You're really awesome.

28:42.430 --> 28:43.385
No.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.759
You're really awesome.

28:46.434 --> 28:47.765
[Giggling]

28:49.270 --> 28:50.931
[Giggling]

28:51.314 --> 28:52.269
Um...

28:53.149 --> 28:54.104
Oh, oh!

28:56.485 --> 28:57.770
See its snout?

28:58.029 --> 28:59.894
It's similar in genetic
makeup to the pig.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.647
It was scenting out its prey,
it knew which of us

29:02.909 --> 29:03.898

Very well.

39:35.916 --> 39:39.408
Close your eyes
and say the words...

39:40.754 --> 39:41.789
No peeking.

39:44.091 --> 39:45.547
"l decline".

39:50.097 --> 39:52.383
l... decline.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.349
It was that easy?

40:02.109 --> 40:03.815
Why didn't you
just say so?

40:04.611 --> 40:07.603
What? A Blood King
can't have a little fun?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.829
Don't think much
of your interior decorator...

40:18.083 --> 40:19.823
It's a work
in progress.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.958
Much like yourself.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.827
Don't change
the subject.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.499
You're not
off the hook yet.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.338
Oh! Look at you.
All grown up.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.252
"The Ash."

40:28.510 --> 40:29.920
Did you get the new
business cards, yet?

40:30.178 --> 40:31.634
Maybe a vanity plate?

40:31.888 --> 40:32.968
Daddy must
be so proud.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.508
You violated Fae law.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.927
Oh, by having a little
fun with SuccuBo?

40:37.185 --> 40:39.312
You executed a blatant
attack on the Light.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.349
Oh, come now.

40:41.607 --> 40:42.972
When did everyone
get so uptight?

40:43.233 --> 40:44.814
I remember the
good old days.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.604
A little raping,
a little pillaging,

40:46.862 --> 40:47.977
the odd
"collateral damage“...

40:48.238 --> 40:49.899
and then you'd
have yourself a party.

40:50.157 --> 40:51.647
Now it's all
rules, rules, rules.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.489
Your actions may
have jeopardized

40:53.744 --> 40:54.654
the new peace plan.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.993
A plan, in case
you've forgotten,

40:57.247 --> 41:00.034
that was endorsed by the
Fae Elders themselves.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.536
What can I say?

41:03.253 --> 41:05.995
Except, mea culpa.

41:06.256 --> 41:09.373
l was just trying to
spice things up a little bit.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.879
l was a cop
for thirty years.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.095
One thing I learned...

41:15.974 --> 41:17.635
...bullshit stinks.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.388
And lady, you reek.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.969
You ever pull a
stunt like this again,

41:23.231 --> 41:25.017
I will personally
rip off your head

41:25.275 --> 41:26.981
and shove it up your
lily white ass.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.520
This détente is
too important

41:28.779 --> 41:31.111
to be screwed up
by some petty feud.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.075
Am I clear?

41:35.786 --> 41:37.071
Crystal.

41:41.124 --> 41:45.208
Hey man, we are just one
Vex short of a real fiesta.

41:46.797 --> 41:47.912
Where you goin'?

41:48.799 --> 41:49.834
I don't know yet.

41:51.218 --> 41:53.129
Why don't I go
make some tea.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.468
Vexster... hey!

41:55.722 --> 41:56.802
Come on,
all is forgiven.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.467
But it shouldn't be, Kenz.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.886
I can't stay here.
Not after what I've done.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.395
Dude, you
saved my life.

42:02.646 --> 42:03.977
Or that pig shifted
to the left

42:04.231 --> 42:06.187
at just
the right moment.

42:06.942 --> 42:09.354
That is not true.

42:11.238 --> 42:12.648
Is it?

42:14.658 --> 42:15.989
You know...

42:16.243 --> 42:17.858
If you'd looked
at my history

42:18.120 --> 42:19.906
you'd know I was
a betting man.

42:21.790 --> 42:24.247
I'm going to take some time
to reflect, you know?

42:24.751 --> 42:25.991
Reset the system.

42:26.253 --> 42:28.039
I guess the
Doctor was right!

42:28.755 --> 42:30.211
Bloody humans...

42:31.925 --> 42:33.961
You thinkin'
maybe Tibet?

42:34.219 --> 42:36.961
India, via Vegas.

42:37.222 --> 42:41.090
You know, the whole
Eat, Pray, Mesmer tour.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.727
Yeah...
Well...

42:45.981 --> 42:47.016
I'll be back.

42:47.274 --> 42:49.265
Fully armed
and ready to rock.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.604
How do I know I'll
ever see you again?

43:02.289 --> 43:03.244
Gasp!

43:04.791 --> 43:07.578
Not your ebony handled
bison bristle blush brush?

43:08.295 --> 43:09.705
Ugh!

43:09.963 --> 43:11.703
You break that brush
and I'll kill ya.

43:11.965 --> 43:12.374
KENZI: Ow!

43:12.632 --> 43:14.247
[Vex laughing]

43:16.219 --> 43:18.005
Catch you
in another lifetime!

43:18.263 --> 43:19.503
Maybe...

43:23.393 --> 43:25.554
I'm gonna
miss that a-hole.

43:27.814 --> 43:28.052
I know.

43:28.315 --> 43:28.724
Ow.

43:28.982 --> 43:30.597
Here.
