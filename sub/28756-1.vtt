02:38.515 --> 02:39.883
How long is this gonna take?

02:41.051 --> 02:42.454
That's really up to you.

02:42.853 --> 02:44.188
Right, then.

02:46.391 --> 02:48.125
I know how this bit goes.

02:53.797 --> 02:56.767
My name is
Elton Hercules John...

03:03.540 --> 03:05.642
and I'm an alcoholic.

03:09.547 --> 03:11.014
And a cocaine addict.

03:14.552 --> 03:15.786
And a sex addict.

03:18.856 --> 03:20.325
And a bulimic.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.795
I'm also a shopaholic,
who has problems with weed...

03:26.563 --> 03:28.298
prescription drugs...

03:31.468 --> 03:33.270
and anger management.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.637
Why are you here now?

03:35.639 --> 03:37.205
Well, my dealer was out of town.

03:37.207 --> 03:39.243
I thought this seemed like
a good alternative.

03:47.452 --> 03:49.386
I'm here because
I want to get better.

03:49.952 --> 03:52.254
What were you like
as a child, Elton?

03:52.256 --> 03:53.689
As a child?

05:39.962 --> 05:42.497
Reggie! You're late!

05:42.499 --> 05:45.435
I've had to throw your dinner
in the bin! Get inside.

05:56.012 --> 05:57.246
Is he back?

05:58.581 --> 05:59.815
What am I? Thin air?

06:00.616 --> 06:01.882
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

06:01.884 --> 06:04.318
He's very unreliable
and very selfish.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.588
But will you send him up
if I'm already in bed?

06:06.590 --> 06:07.890
Reggie! Move!

06:08.257 --> 06:10.293
Got to get this done
before I go out.

06:13.596 --> 06:15.161
All right, all done.

06:15.163 --> 06:16.963
Put it away before you go out.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.867
Mum, I've got to go.

06:19.168 --> 06:20.969
Where's my cardigan?

06:43.759 --> 06:46.694
What?
Did I do something wrong?

06:46.696 --> 06:48.128
Bloody hell, Sheila.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.032
Maybe we should
get him some lessons.

06:50.566 --> 06:53.868
Love to. Get him out
from under my feet.

06:57.139 --> 06:58.974
Go on, play it again.

07:00.342 --> 07:02.043
I want to play it for Dad.

07:08.983 --> 07:10.983
Managed to drag yourself
home then.

07:10.985 --> 07:13.354
- Hello, Stanley.
- How are you, Ivy?

07:13.356 --> 07:14.921
Like you care.

07:14.923 --> 07:16.592
Come on.
You're letting in a draft.

07:21.030 --> 07:22.496
How long you back?

07:22.498 --> 07:24.032
I've got
a couple of weeks' leave.

07:24.299 --> 07:26.666
Reggie's not long gone to bed.

07:26.668 --> 07:29.170
Go on. Pop up, say hello.

07:29.938 --> 07:31.172
I'll see him tomorrow.

07:33.174 --> 07:34.641
Any dinner left?

07:34.643 --> 07:37.078
Or have you fed it all
to that boy?

07:39.147 --> 07:41.049
My dad was passionate about...

07:41.817 --> 07:44.119
family and music.

07:45.154 --> 07:47.289
He'd talk for hours about jazz.

07:48.056 --> 07:49.522
He was always hugging me.

07:49.524 --> 07:50.558
I was very lucky.

07:55.630 --> 07:57.999
I was actually
a very happy child.

08:06.241 --> 08:08.941
Dad, is it true
you play piano?

08:08.943 --> 08:10.577
I'm saving to get lessons.

08:10.579 --> 08:12.812
If you want to sit in here,
you'll have to be quiet.

08:12.814 --> 08:16.016
I'm listening to my music.

08:25.059 --> 08:26.995
I like this one, Dad.

08:32.267 --> 08:35.636
Never, ever touch
my collection without asking.

08:46.314 --> 08:48.283
When are you going to hug me?

08:49.017 --> 08:50.385
Don't be soft.

08:58.828 --> 09:00.360
What are you still doing up?

09:00.662 --> 09:01.663
Learning.

09:02.664 --> 09:04.532
Turn off the light.
Go to sleep.

10:04.759 --> 10:07.860
Crumbs! That was energetic!

10:07.862 --> 10:09.430
Play another one.

10:09.964 --> 10:12.232
The "Moonlight Sonata," Reggie.

10:14.635 --> 10:17.302
Mum? My piano teacher
thinks I'm good enough

10:17.304 --> 10:19.673
for a scholarship
at the Royal Academy of Music.

10:20.975 --> 10:23.443
The Royal Academy of Music?

10:24.077 --> 10:26.380
It has a nice ring to it.

10:26.714 --> 10:27.749
"Royal."

10:28.115 --> 10:29.483
Scissors.

10:31.719 --> 10:34.789
- What do you think?
- The red one's good.

10:36.155 --> 10:39.524
- It's only on Saturdays.
- I've things to do on weekends.

10:39.526 --> 10:41.762
- Can't just drop everything.
- I'll take you.

10:44.398 --> 10:47.432
- Where are you off to?
- Don't know.

10:47.434 --> 10:48.735
Haven't decided yet.

10:49.269 --> 10:52.040
But whatever it is,
you're not invited.

10:52.372 --> 10:55.743
Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's
good enough for a scholarship.

10:56.143 --> 10:57.177
Really?

10:57.645 --> 10:59.510
You think he's got
that kind of talent?

10:59.512 --> 11:01.880
Of course, he has.
But you'd know that

11:01.882 --> 11:04.851
if you took the slightest bit of
interest in me or this family.

11:15.395 --> 11:17.564
Stop looking at that.
You're not a girl.

11:31.210 --> 11:34.846
- Can we go home?
- Home? No going home.

11:34.848 --> 11:36.049
This is your life.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.752
You have to get over
that silly shyness.

11:39.151 --> 11:40.485
But Mum says I'll never...

11:40.487 --> 11:42.420
Everybody's frightened
at the beginning.

11:42.422 --> 11:44.758
You play at being confident.

11:45.826 --> 11:47.926
Life gives you
very few chances, Reggie,

11:47.928 --> 11:49.295
and this is one of yours.

11:49.562 --> 11:51.395
You show 'em you can be
as good as they are.

11:51.397 --> 11:53.834
Better. Number one.
You can do that, can't you?

11:54.467 --> 11:57.569
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Good. Go on then. Here.

11:57.571 --> 12:00.574
Here's for a bag of chips
and your bus fare home.

12:17.757 --> 12:19.059
Reginald Dwight?

12:19.492 --> 12:21.727
- Yes.
- Hi. How do you do?

12:24.196 --> 12:25.699
Good, thank you.

12:26.265 --> 12:27.734
Take your coat off.

12:30.637 --> 12:32.673
Did you not bring
something to play?

12:34.341 --> 12:35.574
Didn't know I had to.

12:37.109 --> 12:38.344
I see. Well...

12:40.446 --> 12:41.979
So, can you show me anything

12:41.981 --> 12:45.251
so I can get a sense
of where you're up to?

13:06.305 --> 13:07.707
Why have you stopped?

13:10.076 --> 13:11.477
That's as far as you got.

13:14.747 --> 13:16.747
You might have a good memory,
and a good ear,

13:16.749 --> 13:18.985
but you've an awful lot
of work to do.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.621
So, wrists and back straight.

13:23.221 --> 13:25.388
Let's start
with the C-major scale,

13:25.390 --> 13:27.560
both hands, two octaves.

13:35.701 --> 13:38.270
Hands off the table, Reginald.
Stop making that noise.

16:15.692 --> 16:17.829
Reggie. What you doing?

16:19.230 --> 16:22.934
Hello, son. I'm Fred.
I'm a friend of your mum's.

16:31.476 --> 16:34.311
You tied me down
with that kid years ago,

16:34.313 --> 16:37.012
and now I've finally
got a reason to leave

16:37.014 --> 16:40.251
and be rid of you
and this bloody house!

17:03.507 --> 17:05.742
He didn't even give me
a hug goodbye.

17:07.511 --> 17:09.646
He's no good
at showing affection.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.682
Never has been.

17:14.352 --> 17:17.587
- I wish I was someone else.
- Oh, don't be silly.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.761
Well, how do you think I felt?

17:27.731 --> 17:28.999
I was a kid.

17:34.305 --> 17:35.739
Heartbroken.

17:38.842 --> 17:40.744
People don't care though,
do they?

17:44.681 --> 17:45.917
Anyway...

17:48.785 --> 17:50.654
I'd discovered records.

17:52.556 --> 17:54.057
And rock 'n' roll.

18:00.398 --> 18:03.698
I know you like him.
He's quite a dish.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.304
- I would.
- Oh, Mum!

18:06.737 --> 18:09.073
Thanks, Mum. It's fantastic.

18:09.307 --> 18:12.240
You serious about wanting
to be a rock 'n' roller?

18:12.242 --> 18:14.042
Yeah. Of course.

18:14.044 --> 18:16.113
Better get you
the proper haircut, eh?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.950
- Can I get it cut like Elvis?
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.983
He's like my side
of the family.

18:21.985 --> 18:24.654
He'll be bald as an egg
by the time he's 20.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.474
Congratulations to Dave.
He's won four pork chops,

18:46.476 --> 18:49.210
half a pound of prime mince
and a string of sausages.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.915
Thank you all! Thank you!

18:52.616 --> 18:54.215
Now, Sheila and Fred's boy

18:54.217 --> 18:56.519
is gonna sing us
a couple of songs on the piano.

18:56.521 --> 18:58.053
Reggie Dwight!

18:58.055 --> 18:59.855
Come on, Reg!

19:00.323 --> 19:01.557
Go on, boy.

19:02.591 --> 19:04.758
Hello.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.997
Bloody hell.
Have you got a fag?

19:11.501 --> 19:12.803
Rubbish!

19:13.070 --> 19:15.839
Reg, Reg,
play the one I like.

19:17.307 --> 19:18.408
Excuse me.

19:18.775 --> 19:20.742
- You can't put that there.
- Why not?

19:20.744 --> 19:22.345

25:55.902 --> 25:56.937
Well, anything.

25:57.337 --> 26:00.238
Rock, soul,
country and western.

27:11.143 --> 27:12.579

Elton John the piano player.

27:29.695 --> 27:31.595
Thank you so much

27:31.597 --> 27:33.632

27:34.000 --> 27:35.198
Give me a chance.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.671
Um... all right.

27:37.871 --> 27:41.240
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

27:50.249 --> 27:51.848
Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

27:51.850 --> 27:53.650

We'll be in touch.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

27:55.588 --> 27:58.490
Okay. Thanks so much

27:59.025 --> 28:00.860
No worries. Come on.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.139

28:17.141 --> 28:19.445

28:24.883 --> 28:25.949
- Yeah.
- Hi.

28:25.951 --> 28:27.519
Well, that's my stage name.

28:28.021 --> 28:31.357
You can tell me your real name when
we get to know each other better.

28:31.724 --> 28:32.759
Right.

28:34.292 --> 28:36.527
- Uh...
- Um...

28:37.730 --> 28:39.462
- I was thinking... Sorry.
- Have you ever... Sorry.

28:39.464 --> 28:41.432
No, no, please.
After you.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.203
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

28:45.671 --> 28:48.540
Yeah, I got the tape
you sent. It's great.

28:49.074 --> 28:51.510
- Really good.
- Thanks.

28:52.244 --> 28:55.912
Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

28:55.914 --> 28:58.516
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

28:58.884 --> 29:00.485
I wrote a tune to it.

29:01.486 --> 29:03.152
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

29:03.154 --> 29:06.823
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

29:06.825 --> 29:10.060
It was all there, I could see all the
notes, and I just had to get it out.

29:10.062 --> 29:13.465
It was like my fingers couldn't work
fast enough to keep up with my brain.

29:15.668 --> 29:17.100
Do you ever get anything
like that?

29:17.102 --> 29:19.405
Uh... not really, no.

29:20.105 --> 29:22.306
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

29:22.907 --> 29:26.210
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

29:27.112 --> 29:28.346
Great.

29:32.350 --> 29:33.618

29:33.919 --> 29:36.955

29:38.289 --> 29:39.558
Yeah, all I ever...

29:39.958 --> 29:41.925
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

33:32.289 --> 33:34.591
You're a couple of pricks
as far as I can tell.

33:34.958 --> 33:36.760
So quit that
backing-band nonsense,

33:37.193 --> 33:40.528
find a place to work together,
and write me tunes

33:40.530 --> 33:43.199
that gray-haired old tramps'll
whistle in the street.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.401
You never know.

33:45.403 --> 33:47.803
One day, you might have
enough for an album.

33:48.238 --> 33:51.308
Do that, and I'll put you
on ten quid a week.

- Hello. I'm Bernie.

34:18.335 --> 34:20.768
Who ever heard of a rock star
with the name Bernie?

34:24.341 --> 34:25.741
Lovely.

34:29.713 --> 34:32.349
So what are your plans
now... Elton?

34:32.849 --> 34:34.447
Not too sure.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.752
Written a lot of songs,
haven't we? Enough for an album.

34:37.186 --> 34:39.788
And Elton's got
himself a girlfriend now.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.193
Arabella,
our new landlady. Yep.

34:44.327 --> 34:46.495
So what about rock 'n' roll?

34:47.663 --> 34:50.266
What about hot chicks
and cocaine orgies?

34:50.565 --> 34:51.935
What about fame and fortune?

34:52.369 --> 34:54.703
What about the fact
that you're a fag?

34:59.507 --> 35:00.541
A what?

35:01.210 --> 35:04.646
Your little friend
is a homosexual.

35:06.383 --> 35:07.914
No, I've got a girlfriend.

35:07.916 --> 35:10.853
When's that ever stopped anybody?

35:15.191 --> 35:16.226
Are you?

35:20.230 --> 35:21.264
Don't know.

35:25.134 --> 35:27.136
Would it matter
if I was, Bernie?

35:30.506 --> 35:31.874
No, not to me.

35:35.644 --> 35:37.478
Might matter to Arabella,
though.

35:39.081 --> 35:41.748
- Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that.
- Have you met her?

35:41.750 --> 35:43.153

What is it now?

36:12.448 --> 36:14.083

36:14.949 --> 36:16.951
You're going to tell her.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.022
It'll break her heart.

36:20.822 --> 36:22.257
Not sure she has one.

- Yeah.

36:33.901 --> 36:37.670
There's so much that we gotta do.
There's worlds to conquer.

36:37.672 --> 36:41.343
I mean, America.
Wide open spaces.

36:44.113 --> 36:45.680
Tower Records.

36:46.548 --> 36:48.050
Listen, the songs are great.

36:48.749 --> 36:52.419
And people keep asking. They're, like,
"Who's that singing on the demos?" And I...

36:52.421 --> 36:54.488
You are a shit-hot piano player,

36:54.490 --> 36:57.157
you have an amazing voice,
and I'm telling you,

36:57.159 --> 36:59.360
there is something
special that happens...

37:00.394 --> 37:01.929
when you sing our songs.

37:02.531 --> 37:05.599
You heard what Dick said.
He said my hands are like midget boxers.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.135
Who cares what Dick thinks.

37:08.136 --> 37:10.071
I just don't know if I'm...

37:10.905 --> 37:12.640
what they're looking for.

37:17.946 --> 37:20.082
It's time for you
to be out front.

37:27.722 --> 37:29.090
I love you, man.

37:31.225 --> 37:32.660
I do, but...

37:33.728 --> 37:35.196
not in that way.

37:41.503 --> 37:43.405
Yeah.

37:44.972 --> 37:47.942
Elton, time for bed.

37:54.215 --> 37:56.250
We became inseparable
after that.

37:57.485 --> 37:59.153
The brother I never had.

38:00.021 --> 38:01.954
Do you know, in 20 years,

38:01.956 --> 38:05.824
we have never had
a single argument. Not once.

38:05.826 --> 38:09.030
Anyway, I took his advice,
told Arabella.

38:10.364 --> 38:12.233
She took it very well,
actually.

38:13.767 --> 38:16.868
You bastard!

38:16.870 --> 38:18.370
She's killed my piano.

38:18.372 --> 38:20.975
You treacherous beast!

38:21.676 --> 38:24.845
Your music's as shitty
as you are!

38:26.280 --> 38:27.315
Hi, Mum.

38:27.782 --> 38:29.884
I knew you'd be back.

38:30.586 --> 38:33.753
You'll have to pay rent.
I'm not made of money.

38:41.995 --> 38:43.598
- Morning.
- Good morning.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.267
- Get dressed, Reggie!
- Elton.

38:47.134 --> 38:49.237
I'm not having you
moping around here all day.

38:49.736 --> 38:50.771
We're songwriting.

38:51.272 --> 38:53.908
Oh, yeah?
Looks like it's going well.

38:56.612 --> 38:59.578
Right. I will not
have a mess in this house.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.048
It's nice and tidy,
and that's how I want it to stay.

39:02.516 --> 39:04.617
I'll not have
a doss house around here.

39:04.619 --> 39:08.389
I can't do everything.
I can't cook and clean and wash.

39:09.089 --> 39:11.557
Rely upon me to do everything.
It's not fair.

39:11.559 --> 39:12.792
There's egg on this.

39:16.631 --> 39:19.900
I'd better go
take a shave, I think.

put you on a three-album deal.

43:04.556 --> 43:07.125
- Three?
- A year.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.926
And I got you a couple of
nights at the Troubadour.

43:09.928 --> 43:13.131
- Doug Weston's an old friend.
- Hang on. The Troubadour?

43:13.432 --> 43:16.700
- It's this really cool folk club in LA.
- Yeah, we know what it is, Ray.

43:16.702 --> 43:18.703
Hang on. Now, let's not be
hasty, because the thing is,

43:18.705 --> 43:20.370
I haven't even got
a backing band yet.

43:20.372 --> 43:22.173
No, I've sorted the backup
band, don't worry.

43:22.507 --> 43:24.173
Dick, I don't wanna
appear ungrateful,

43:24.175 --> 43:25.709
but you can't just spring
the Troubadour on me.

43:25.711 --> 43:27.980
Look, it's time to do
something bold, Elton.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.916
Granted, America's
a bit of a gamble,

43:31.416 --> 43:33.218
and you fuck up
and I'll kill ya.

43:34.152 --> 43:36.455
But Ray'll go, too.
He'll keep an eye on you.

43:36.922 --> 43:41.059
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Get something flashy.

43:41.827 --> 43:43.462

43:44.296 --> 43:46.464

kill yourself with drugs.

Hey, Doug. Bernie.
Nice to meet you.

- Good morning.

45:05.109 --> 45:06.875
- Hi. I'm Elton.
- Oh.

45:06.877 --> 45:08.544
Sweet. How are you?

45:08.546 --> 45:11.113
Monday night at the Troubadour, man.

45:11.115 --> 45:12.615
It's gonna blow your mind.

45:12.617 --> 45:14.920
Be totally packed.
You're gonna love it.

45:15.319 --> 45:17.252
It's a bit different
from what I expected.

45:17.254 --> 45:18.289
Yeah?

45:18.690 --> 45:20.356
Yeah, it's just a bit smaller.

45:20.358 --> 45:22.357
Well, size is
everything, my friend.

45:22.359 --> 45:23.993
Neil Young
played here last week

45:23.995 --> 45:26.762
and there were people lined
around the block.

45:26.764 --> 45:28.966
Man, it was just...
It was the best night ever.

45:29.467 --> 45:31.435
- That's a cool hat.
- Yeah?

45:31.802 --> 45:34.005
- You like it?
- I do like it, yeah.

45:34.705 --> 45:36.772
- I won that hat, in a bet.
- Oh.

45:36.774 --> 45:38.374
- With Bob Dylan.
- Really?

45:38.376 --> 45:39.575
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

45:39.577 --> 45:41.210
Elton. This is the band.

45:41.212 --> 45:43.379
I'm just gonna check
they know what they're doing.

45:43.381 --> 45:45.981
So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

45:45.983 --> 45:47.417
They just flew in from England

45:47.752 --> 45:49.654
and, boy, their arms are tired.

45:55.960 --> 45:58.529
Whoa, dude,
what the hell are you wearing?

46:01.732 --> 46:02.733

Where's Reggie? Where's Reggie?
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

46:05.569 --> 46:08.237
Neil Diamond is at the bar.
He's talking to Leon Russell

46:08.239 --> 46:11.441
and half the fucking
Beach Boys. Huh?

46:14.779 --> 46:16.513
Jesus, shit, Bernie!

46:17.414 --> 46:18.649
Reggie?

46:18.983 --> 46:21.585
- Elton. I think you're overreacting.
- No.

46:22.252 --> 46:24.953
Bernie, you are under-reacting.

46:24.955 --> 46:27.523
They are the geniuses
of American music.

46:27.525 --> 46:29.258
I can't go out there
in front of that lot!

46:29.260 --> 46:33.528
Okay, okay. Then we'll tell Doug
to refund everyone's ticket,

46:33.530 --> 46:35.630
- and we'll send everybody home.
- Where is he?

46:35.632 --> 46:38.466
- Hey, Ray.
- You've signed a contract!

46:38.468 --> 46:40.002
Dick's paid
your fucking airfare!

46:40.004 --> 46:42.639

46:50.514 --> 46:51.716

50:26.296 --> 50:28.030

50:29.232 --> 50:30.432
Thank you.

All right.
Enough of this bullshit.

and let me tell you,

55:38.805 --> 55:42.842
there are moments in a rock
star's life that define who he is

as he ascends into the heavens.

55:50.983 --> 55:52.452

55:52.851 --> 55:57.257

We're in San Francisco
tomorrow for three nights.

- "Rejoice.

57:57.142 --> 57:59.442
Rock music has a new star.

57:59.444 --> 58:03.213
He's Englishman Elton John,
a 23-year-old,

58:03.215 --> 58:08.986
whose debut at the Troubadour
was, in every way, magnificent."

58:09.353 --> 58:10.986

- Four.

58:20.665 --> 58:22.100
Did... You said four shows?

58:22.401 --> 58:24.634
- Yes.
- That's not gonna work!

58:24.636 --> 58:25.670
So...

58:28.875 --> 58:30.407
will I see you
when I get back?

58:30.409 --> 58:33.743
Now, don't worry about me.
Go and enjoy your moment.

58:33.745 --> 58:36.280

- Come to London with me.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.981

58:38.983 --> 58:42.052

I'll look you up. Promise.

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.543
No one's
getting phased out, Dick.

01:04:09.544 --> 01:04:12.948
Elton feels things will run more
smoothly if he has personal management.

01:04:14.249 --> 01:04:17.120
- There's never been a problem before.
- And there isn't one now.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:21.155
Look, there's loads of work and
commitments, tours, etcetera.

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.389
That's what I'll be doing,
personal management.

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:25.393
- Taking care of things.
- Is that right?

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.728
You realize I've got
a contract with Elton.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.262
I've had that looked into,

01:04:29.264 --> 01:04:30.631
and my client
is quite entitled

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.132
to take on
outside representation.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.535
That's what you think.

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:38.373
You fucking poofter.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.978
And you. You're happy
with this arrangement, are ya?

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:44.646
Right?

01:04:44.946 --> 01:04:46.149
After all these years?

01:04:46.548 --> 01:04:48.283
It's nothing personal, Dick.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.421
Come on, Ray.

01:04:58.059 --> 01:04:59.628
Best of luck to you, Elton.

01:05:04.466 --> 01:05:07.836
Your very expensive painting
is upside down.

01:05:10.605 --> 01:05:13.608
- After you, Mr. James.
- Thank you, Raymond.

01:05:15.443 --> 01:05:17.046
Well...

01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:19.548
that was absolutely horrible.

01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:22.949
Don't worry, it's business.
Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine.

01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:27.020
Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called
about the Royal Variety Performance.

01:05:27.022 --> 01:05:29.222
Apparently,
the Queen Mother is a big fan.

01:05:29.224 --> 01:05:32.559
Couldn't we have kept on Ray?
He's such a lovely guy.

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.396
"Lovely guy" is not a job.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.632
This is a crucial time,
Elton.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.633
You and I are gonna
have to be more careful,

01:05:40.635 --> 01:05:42.303
'cause the papers
have been sniffing around.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:44.772
We can't give them
anything to speculate on.

01:05:45.073 --> 01:05:47.374
I'm thinking of getting
someone in as your girlfriend.

01:05:48.076 --> 01:05:50.578
- Doesn't that seem a bit excessive?
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:50.779 --> 01:05:52.846
This is your career
and our business at stake.

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:55.349
If our sleeping
arrangements get out...

01:05:55.717 --> 01:05:57.652
- all of this is gone.
- Right.

01:05:58.086 --> 01:06:00.255
And you're gonna have
to talk to your parents.

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:02.288
Make sure they know
what to say.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.359
Those are the first doors
reporters knock on.

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:17.371
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello, Dad.

01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:25.914
Well, come on in.

01:06:27.282 --> 01:06:29.484
Well, those are
very fancy shoes.

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.720
Oh. Yeah.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.755
I brought you something.

01:06:44.398 --> 01:06:45.633
Why are you here, Reg?

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:49.936
The boys.

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:55.708
Dad, there's
a Rolls-Royce outside.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.578
Stephen, Geoff...

01:06:58.512 --> 01:07:00.848
this is your brother, Reggie.

01:07:01.115 --> 01:07:02.216
Half brother.

01:07:02.683 --> 01:07:04.652
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.

01:07:05.986 --> 01:07:06.854
Hmm.

01:07:07.389 --> 01:07:09.255
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

01:07:09.257 --> 01:07:11.226
you and I could
get together, if you like.

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.695
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:17.631
Not really my thing.

01:07:19.067 --> 01:07:22.169
Is it true
you're worth 25 million pound?

01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:24.736
Do you know,
I don't actually know.

01:07:24.738 --> 01:07:27.308
They're really
proud of you. Mmm.

01:07:27.942 --> 01:07:30.678
Yeah, we've even got
some of your records.

01:07:31.178 --> 01:07:34.515
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:43.892
You probably get asked this all the
time, but would you...

01:07:44.624 --> 01:07:46.459
Would you mind signing this?

01:07:50.164 --> 01:07:51.497
Yeah, of course.

01:07:57.137 --> 01:08:00.074
Oh, no. Would you
make it out to Arthur?

01:08:01.508 --> 01:08:03.510
He's one of the blokes
from work.

01:08:03.844 --> 01:08:05.479
Yeah, he's a big fan.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.781
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:17.057 --> 01:08:18.058
Perfect.

01:08:21.028 --> 01:08:22.062
Right.

01:08:23.496 --> 01:08:26.834
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

01:08:27.768 --> 01:08:28.969
- I suppose they have.
- Mmm.

01:08:29.603 --> 01:08:32.104
'Cause, you know,
not everybody gets a second chance.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:40.247
The boys loved
meeting a real-life pop star.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.814
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:44.251
Bye.

01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:49.087
- When I grow up, Dad...
- Get inside.

01:08:49.089 --> 01:08:51.859
What are you doing
without your shoes on?

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:54.627
You're gonna be a draftsman.

01:08:56.362 --> 01:08:57.697
Back inside.

01:09:25.091 --> 01:09:27.859
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?

01:09:35.768 --> 01:09:37.237
Will you stop sulking?

01:09:39.173 --> 01:09:41.274
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

01:09:41.808 --> 01:09:44.010
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:47.078
Right, stop the car.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.615
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

01:09:54.488 --> 01:09:56.989
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

01:09:58.191 --> 01:10:00.691
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

01:10:00.693 --> 01:10:04.864
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

01:10:05.499 --> 01:10:07.065
Elton. Elton!

01:10:07.067 --> 01:10:08.733
Drive 'round, Denis.

01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:10.600
<i>Liberace!</i>

01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:21.178
Pinner nine, seven,
double-five.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.916
- Mum, it's me.
- <i>I know who you are.</i>

01:10:25.785 --> 01:10:27.352
Well, I've got something
to tell you.

01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:30.322
Reggie, we're gonna miss
the bit of the show with you on.

01:10:30.324 --> 01:10:31.757
Look, shut up, Mum!

01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:34.626
I'm not on telly yet, am I?
I'm talking to you.

01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:37.997
I...

01:10:38.697 --> 01:10:40.233
Me and John, we...

01:10:42.435 --> 01:10:43.735
Well, the thing is...

01:10:47.473 --> 01:10:50.309
I'm... a homosexual.

01:10:54.647 --> 01:10:56.181
A poofter.

01:10:57.517 --> 01:10:58.917
A fairy.

01:10:59.684 --> 01:11:00.886
A queen.

01:11:06.392 --> 01:11:07.792
Well, say something.

01:11:11.264 --> 01:11:13.833
Oh, for God's sake,
I know that.

01:11:16.269 --> 01:11:17.370
Known for years.

01:11:19.804 --> 01:11:22.374
- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

01:11:23.141 --> 01:11:26.244
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

01:11:28.481 --> 01:11:30.813
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

01:11:30.815 --> 01:11:32.451
of being alone forever.

01:11:33.619 --> 01:11:36.022
You'll never be loved properly.

01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:43.828
<i>Right. Got to go.</i>

01:11:52.971 --> 01:11:54.906
She said I'll never be loved.

01:11:56.241 --> 01:11:58.107
Don't ever put me
in this position again.

01:11:58.109 --> 01:11:59.376
You're onstage in 10 minutes,

01:11:59.378 --> 01:12:01.178
so get over yourself
and do the show.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.182
We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:07.220
Don't ever put your hands on me.

01:12:11.923 --> 01:12:13.992
Real love's hard to come by.

01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:23.101
So you find a way
to cope without it.

01:13:25.062 --> 01:13:26.797
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.299 --> 01:13:29.532
Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:33.935
I'm about to embark on the
highest-grossing tour in rock history.

01:13:33.937 --> 01:13:35.871
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:38.241
of all record sales
on the entire planet,

01:13:38.243 --> 01:13:41.110
and I have the biggest
headdress known to man.

01:13:41.112 --> 01:13:43.079
So, yeah,
I think I'm okay, Bernie.

01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:44.846
It used to just be
the two of us.

01:13:44.848 --> 01:13:46.982
Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

01:13:46.984 --> 01:13:48.751
Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just

01:13:48.753 --> 01:13:51.456
go out there and sing without
this ridiculous paraphernalia?

01:13:52.089 --> 01:13:55.293
You know,
just be yourself, Reg?

01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:59.195
Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?

01:13:59.197 --> 01:14:02.198
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.866
People don't pay
to see Reginald Dwight.

01:14:04.868 --> 01:14:07.370
They pay to see Elton John!

01:14:07.372 --> 01:14:10.541
Don't ever tell me
how to do my fucking job!

01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:18.550
Break a leg.

01:14:21.386 --> 01:14:22.918
You don't have
to put up with this, Reg.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.155
Write the fucking lyrics,
Bernie!

01:14:25.856 --> 01:14:27.592
Let me deal with the rest.

01:14:33.263 --> 01:14:34.796
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:14:34.798 --> 01:14:37.232
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:14:37.234 --> 01:14:41.503

- Where am I?
- At your house in LA, Mr. John.

01:16:03.454 --> 01:16:04.488
Right.

01:16:05.756 --> 01:16:07.257
I'll put some coffee on.

01:16:16.032 --> 01:16:19.033
Darling, I've been thinking,
maybe we should quit the booze

01:16:19.035 --> 01:16:21.572
for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

01:16:23.273 --> 01:16:24.508
Afternoon.

01:16:25.975 --> 01:16:27.211
Mr. Reid.

01:16:32.849 --> 01:16:34.950
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

01:16:34.952 --> 01:16:37.788
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!

01:16:38.087 --> 01:16:40.657
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

01:16:40.891 --> 01:16:43.792
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

01:16:43.794 --> 01:16:46.663
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

01:16:46.897 --> 01:16:48.697
insurance, copyright indemnity,

01:16:48.699 --> 01:16:50.832
renegotiating your
previously insane contracts

01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:52.400
and wiping your arse.

01:16:52.402 --> 01:16:54.469
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

01:16:54.471 --> 01:16:57.605
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87
million-dollar-a-year industry.

01:16:57.607 --> 01:17:00.309
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:03.045
Hmm? I pay, John.

01:17:03.846 --> 01:17:05.081
For everything.

01:17:05.414 --> 01:17:07.617
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

01:17:08.017 --> 01:17:11.318
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.320
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

01:17:13.322 --> 01:17:14.890
I want to be by myself,

01:17:14.892 --> 01:17:18.393
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

01:17:18.395 --> 01:17:21.364
and takes the piss
day after day!

01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:24.130
- Get out!
- Yoo-hoo!

01:17:24.132 --> 01:17:25.701
Elton.

01:17:26.969 --> 01:17:28.302
What are they doing here?

01:17:28.304 --> 01:17:29.603
You told me to hire a jet

01:17:29.605 --> 01:17:30.941
and fly them over
for the gig.

01:17:31.607 --> 01:17:34.742
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

01:17:34.744 --> 01:17:36.477
I'm gonna go
and fetch them a drink.

01:17:36.479 --> 01:17:38.178
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up,

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.547
because you fucking stink.

01:17:39.549 --> 01:17:43.119
Sheila! It's been too long.

01:17:43.586 --> 01:17:46.185
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

01:17:46.187 --> 01:17:47.523
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

01:17:48.256 --> 01:17:51.392
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

01:17:51.394 --> 01:17:53.029
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:54.895
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

01:17:54.897 --> 01:17:57.498
Elton, darling,
you remember the Andersons

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.733
- from next door, don't you?
- Yes, the Andersons.

01:17:59.735 --> 01:18:01.537
How could we forget
the Andersons?

01:18:01.837 --> 01:18:03.072
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:18:05.107 --> 01:18:08.010
And what a shy little boy
you were.

01:18:08.276 --> 01:18:09.810
Look at you now.

01:18:09.812 --> 01:18:12.178
Elton, you must
give them a tour.

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.581
- Yes, right now, go on.
- Yeah, okay.

01:18:13.583 --> 01:18:15.315
Everyone,
Elton is giving a tour.

01:18:15.317 --> 01:18:18.084
- Mum, you're on my gown.
- Don't be rude.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.597
Here we go.
Come here, come here. Excited?

01:18:28.397 --> 01:18:29.632
- Car.
- Yeah.

01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:36.070
- Bernie, how's it going, man?
- Hey, man. How's it going?

01:18:36.072 --> 01:18:37.840
No idea who he is.
Of course.

01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:54.824
Here he is!

01:18:55.257 --> 01:18:57.156
Ladies, Elton.

01:18:57.158 --> 01:18:58.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.227
What are you
doing on your own up here?

01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:02.662
Miserable bastard.

01:19:02.664 --> 01:19:04.364
You're missing
all the fun downstairs.

01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:06.265
Well, as long as all the fun
isn't missing me,

01:19:06.267 --> 01:19:08.136
then who gives a shit, Bernie?

01:19:11.841 --> 01:19:12.875
We should get a drink.

01:19:13.743 --> 01:19:16.610
- No, we should. Let's go get a drink.
- Come on, it's fine.

01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:19.212
No, we absolutely should.
No, I'm telling you...

01:19:19.214 --> 01:19:21.750
Yeah, go and get
a little drink.

01:19:54.516 --> 01:19:56.449
You look amazing.

01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:59.019
Fucking prick.

01:20:11.198 --> 01:20:13.333
For my next trick,

01:20:15.503 --> 01:20:17.472

- Yes, sorry. You were saying?

01:24:53.246 --> 01:24:55.915
I was saying
that I think I need a break.

01:24:56.248 --> 01:24:58.449
You need to take a break?

01:24:58.451 --> 01:25:01.988
I think that I just need
to go and sort myself out a bit.

01:25:04.457 --> 01:25:05.656
What?

01:25:05.658 --> 01:25:09.228
I'm going home... for a while.

01:25:09.929 --> 01:25:11.263
Well, that's nice for you.

01:25:11.697 --> 01:25:15.868

both of us just disappear together?

01:25:20.505 --> 01:25:22.408
We'll go to my ranch,
we'll hide away.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.743
We can write like we did.

01:25:26.445 --> 01:25:27.947

01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:31.283
We should go home, Elton.

01:25:32.418 --> 01:25:33.753
Reconnect.

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:39.892
No, you should go.

01:25:41.328 --> 01:25:43.962

I'd like to work with anyway.

01:25:44.863 --> 01:25:48.267

Collaborate with other people.

01:25:49.801 --> 01:25:51.303

seems to be doing at the moment.

Why don't you get back in
the studio you're paying for?

01:29:39.564 --> 01:29:43.233
Why don't you sell my fucking records?
What's this? Hmm?

01:29:43.766 --> 01:29:45.467
Number 11 in Italy.

01:29:45.469 --> 01:29:47.768

No, the problem...

01:29:51.141 --> 01:29:55.212
is you have
never understood me...

01:29:55.779 --> 01:29:57.481
and what I have to go through.

01:29:57.814 --> 01:29:59.981
And you know what?
I should've sacked you when you left me.

01:29:59.983 --> 01:30:03.118
I am glad I left you.
It means I can maintain some objectivity

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.787

myopic little world.

01:30:05.789 --> 01:30:08.292

and make some music or don't.

01:30:08.592 --> 01:30:09.825

01:30:25.743 --> 01:30:29.580

01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:31.579
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

01:35:32.112 --> 01:35:33.346
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

01:35:33.348 --> 01:35:36.150
Just talking about poor Renate.

01:35:37.018 --> 01:35:38.353
Such a lovely woman.

01:35:38.653 --> 01:35:40.855
Divorce can be so painful.

01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:44.289
- Yeah.
- Anyway, celebration is in order.

01:35:46.226 --> 01:35:50.261
We found a lovely villa
by the sea.

01:35:50.263 --> 01:35:51.931
It'd be good if you would
talk to John today,

01:35:51.933 --> 01:35:54.834
get the money arranged.
Can't risk losing this one.

01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:56.402
Yeah, in Minorca.

01:35:56.404 --> 01:35:57.703
It is a lovely place.
You should see it.

01:35:57.705 --> 01:35:59.907
- Minorca, eh?
- Mmm.

01:36:02.076 --> 01:36:03.745
What do you want
to go there for?

01:36:04.245 --> 01:36:06.277
- Because you're driving me away.
- Mmm.

01:36:06.279 --> 01:36:08.246
Every time
we open a paper,

01:36:08.248 --> 01:36:11.184
there's something about you and
the booze or the drugs, and...

01:36:11.953 --> 01:36:13.953
you're breaking
your poor mum's heart.

01:36:13.955 --> 01:36:15.955
Tell you what,
I'll write you a check. Hmm?

01:36:15.957 --> 01:36:17.622
So she can go buy a new one.

01:36:17.624 --> 01:36:19.994
Typical that you'd say
something like that about me,

01:36:20.327 --> 01:36:22.260
when I've given up
so much for you.

01:36:22.262 --> 01:36:23.963
What have you given up for me?

01:36:23.965 --> 01:36:27.435
Your father... for a start.

01:36:32.272 --> 01:36:34.508
You really are
a heartless monster.

01:36:38.879 --> 01:36:41.415
You know, I don't live my life
in black and white.

01:36:43.084 --> 01:36:46.721
And I do not want your fucked-up,
frigid ideas about anything.

01:36:50.524 --> 01:36:52.992
You know, I am so sick

01:36:52.994 --> 01:36:54.761
of running away from who I am.

01:36:56.963 --> 01:37:00.131
There's nothing wrong
with success. Or pleasure.

01:37:00.133 --> 01:37:01.499
In fact,
why am I apologizing for it?

01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:03.970
Mum, I have fucked
everything that moves.

01:37:05.572 --> 01:37:08.373
And I've taken
every drug known to man.

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:09.609
All of them.

01:37:10.945 --> 01:37:11.979
Do you know what?

01:37:13.881 --> 01:37:15.649
I enjoyed
every last minute of it.

01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:18.817
Ever since you first dangled
your fat little legs

01:37:18.819 --> 01:37:20.687
in front of a piano,
you've been lucky.

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.622
You've never worked hard
for a bloody thing in your life.

01:37:24.624 --> 01:37:27.192
It all just comes to you.
You don't do anything.

01:37:27.194 --> 01:37:29.227
And I'm the one who suffers.

01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:31.463
I should never
have had children.

01:37:31.465 --> 01:37:35.869
Do you know how disappointing
it is to be your mother?

Nobody hates you, Elton.

01:39:20.573 --> 01:39:22.708
Campaign to kill yourself
is going well.

01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:24.977
What are you doing here,
Bernie?

01:39:26.045 --> 01:39:27.079
Hmm?

01:39:27.646 --> 01:39:29.182
You left when it suited you.

01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:31.617
Now you come back
to lecture me?

01:39:33.086 --> 01:39:35.987
'Cause the thing is,
the first time we actually got anywhere,

01:39:35.989 --> 01:39:36.923
you left, didn't you?

01:39:37.157 --> 01:39:39.090
Some girl was more important
to you than me

01:39:39.092 --> 01:39:42.094
and all those legends
who were welcoming us in.

01:39:43.929 --> 01:39:46.866
You left me at the most
important time, Bernie.

01:39:47.733 --> 01:39:49.034
When did you give up?

01:39:50.502 --> 01:39:53.470
If you don't care about yourself,
how do you expect anyone else to?

01:39:53.472 --> 01:39:55.774
Whenever I needed you most...

01:39:57.109 --> 01:40:00.711
- you weren't there.
- It's not weak to ask for help.

01:40:00.713 --> 01:40:03.849
I have worked my balls off
to get us out of the shit.

01:40:04.683 --> 01:40:08.118
Day in, day out, for years.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.754
And now it's me that can't
walk down the streets.

01:40:10.756 --> 01:40:14.126
It's me
who doesn't have a life.

01:40:14.927 --> 01:40:17.794
'Cause I don't get to sit
around with my feet on a desk,

01:40:17.796 --> 01:40:19.730
chewing on the end
of a fucking pencil.

01:40:19.732 --> 01:40:22.132
"Write the lyrics, Bernie.
I'll take care of everything else."

01:40:22.134 --> 01:40:23.535
That was a test!

01:40:26.273 --> 01:40:27.406
You should've known.

01:40:27.973 --> 01:40:29.742

01:46:04.674 --> 01:46:08.444
Yeah, but I started
acting like a cunt in 1975.

01:46:11.046 --> 01:46:12.515
I just forgot to stop.

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.755
I do feel ashamed.

01:46:22.024 --> 01:46:25.996
Spent so long feeling resentful
for things that just don't matter.

01:46:33.202 --> 01:46:35.371
Maybe I should've tried
to be more ordinary.

01:46:41.877 --> 01:46:43.112
Hello, Nan.

01:46:43.912 --> 01:46:45.948
You was never ordinary.

01:46:46.949 --> 01:46:48.183
Look at you.

01:46:49.184 --> 01:46:52.455
In here, talking
about your feelings.

01:46:53.256 --> 01:46:55.188
What a waste of time.

01:46:55.190 --> 01:46:58.193
Mum, I know it was never easy.

01:46:58.894 --> 01:47:00.529
And I hope you can forgive me.

01:47:02.331 --> 01:47:04.933
Because I've realized
that's what we need to do now.

01:47:06.035 --> 01:47:07.803
Forgive each other.

01:47:09.706 --> 01:47:12.174
- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- No.

01:47:13.175 --> 01:47:15.545
My problem was I believed
you loved me.

01:47:15.811 --> 01:47:17.445
And you're incapable of it.

01:47:17.447 --> 01:47:19.145
I gave everything
to keep something

01:47:19.147 --> 01:47:20.948
that I never even had
in the first place.

01:47:22.251 --> 01:47:25.054
I always thought you was
an introverted extrovert.

01:47:25.721 --> 01:47:29.124
- A what?
- He's shy. He's always been shy.

01:47:29.525 --> 01:47:31.193
It's all his father's fault.

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:35.397
Don't blame me.
He'd have been strange, regardless.

01:47:35.998 --> 01:47:38.334
Actually, I think
I'm okay with "strange."

01:47:38.834 --> 01:47:41.438
God. Not him.

01:47:41.670 --> 01:47:43.539
Both of you. Stop.

01:47:44.138 --> 01:47:47.476
I'm not going to allow you to
talk to me like this anymore.

01:47:49.311 --> 01:47:51.180
It's about time you said that.

01:47:55.684 --> 01:47:56.919
Bernie.

01:47:59.955 --> 01:48:01.688
I never told you
how much I need you.

01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:03.559
No, no, no, I love you, man.

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.629
Always have, always will.

01:48:09.163 --> 01:48:11.966
You write songs
that millions of people love.

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:13.769
And that's what's important.

01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:16.505
You just need to remember
who you are...

01:48:17.972 --> 01:48:19.274
and be okay with it.

01:48:19.808 --> 01:48:21.577
He doesn't know who he is.

01:48:28.884 --> 01:48:30.184
Yes, I do.

01:48:32.788 --> 01:48:34.555
I'm Elton Hercules John.

01:48:36.157 --> 01:48:38.192
I thought
you were Reggie Dwight.

01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:51.073
I haven't been
Reggie Dwight for years.

01:49:05.353 --> 01:49:07.155
When are you going
to hug me?

01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:42.490
Impressed you know
how to use one of those.

01:49:47.093 --> 01:49:48.463
How you doing?

01:49:50.164 --> 01:49:51.265
Good to see you.

01:49:51.732 --> 01:49:54.335
Some days are tougher than
others, but I feel good.

01:49:56.003 --> 01:49:57.505
They got a piano here?

01:49:58.306 --> 01:50:00.139
- You been playing?
- Hmm...

01:50:00.141 --> 01:50:01.607
- No.
- No?

01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:03.712
Not in the right place
for that just now.

01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.112
I'm scared, Bernie.

01:50:10.083 --> 01:50:11.586
What if I'm not as good...

01:50:14.154 --> 01:50:15.690
without the drink
and the drugs?

01:50:19.427 --> 01:50:21.128
You know that's not true.

01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:24.763
You're not scared
you're not good without it,

01:50:24.765 --> 01:50:26.100
