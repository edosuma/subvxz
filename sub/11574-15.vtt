WEBVTT

00:06.424 --> 00:08.130
[KENZI] Bobo!

00:08.217 --> 00:11.584
Seﬁora, I'm home.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.544
Bo!

00:13.639 --> 00:15.470
--Banana.
--Kenzi,

00:15.558 --> 00:16.593
maybe she's still sleeping.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.890
Yeah, but she'll want to see us.

00:17.977 --> 00:21.014
I mean, she's been all
by herself for the past week.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.686
[moaning]

00:22.773 --> 00:25.731
Really? It sounds to me
like Bo's got company.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.776
Why don't we go out the back, Jack?

00:28.863 --> 00:30.444
I'm guessing that was the grand finale.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.240
I know this cool little place that
has the best blueberry muffins ever.

00:34.327 --> 00:38.366
Sounds good. I'll take two.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.114
Uh, uh...

00:41.209 --> 00:43.575
...mystery birthday bracelet guy, right?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.205
Kenzi. Kenzi's...?

00:45.296 --> 00:46.627
--Nate.
--Nate.

00:46.714 --> 00:51.048
--Nice to meet you.
--Ryan. Good to meet you, both.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.635
Hi.

00:55.765 --> 00:58.006
So, how was the trip?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.637
Cut too short,
so we've got to go back out.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.638
--O kay.
--[BO] Hey, Ryan,

01:01.729 --> 01:04.516
who are you talking to?

01:07.318 --> 01:08.808
Hi.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.064
I didn't think you guys were
going to be back until tonight.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.396
--Clearly.
--Well, my last gig fell through,

01:13.491 --> 01:14.571
so we figured we might as well--

01:14.659 --> 01:15.774
Go get some pastries.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.610
--Pastries, yeah.
--See y'all in a few hours.

01:21.082 --> 01:21.946
Well, that was awkward.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.906
Do you think I should have
asked them to join in?

01:24.001 --> 01:25.457
And awkward just got creepy.

01:25.544 --> 01:26.875
No, 'cause that could be really fun.

01:26.963 --> 01:29.796
Oh! Are you saying that what
we did right now was not fun?

01:29.882 --> 01:31.418
Fun? No.

01:31.509 --> 01:32.419
--No?
--Not fun.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.590
--Not fun?
--No.

01:33.678 --> 01:39.218
Like splendid, astonishing, educational.

01:39.308 --> 01:43.096
Uh huh. Well, that just tells me
that I still have a lot to teach you.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.394
Mindblowing. Mindblowing.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.108
--Hey, Tony.
--Hey, I can't talk,

01:51.195 --> 01:52.981
I've got a thing.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.509
Dude!

02:17.596 --> 02:18.881
Are you for real?

02:18.973 --> 02:20.964
Help me.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.141
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell? Hey.

02:24.228 --> 02:27.516
Hey. Okay...

02:27.606 --> 02:33.021
Tony, it's me, Cole.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.939
Cole?

02:39.035 --> 02:41.492
What? No way.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.739
Help.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.570
This is messed up.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.536
Please!

02:53.674 --> 02:56.586
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.589
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.592
My love carries a death sentence.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.765
l was lost for years,

03:04.852 --> 03:07.514
searching, while hiding,

03:07.605 --> 03:11.769
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:11.859 --> 03:16.728
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.991
Bo, are you done playing doctor?

03:26.082 --> 03:29.199
Kenzi, get over here.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.249
Finally. A long overdue reunion.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.293
I am so sorry about earlier.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.962
I didn't realize you guys were coming.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.539
I didn't know you were either.

03:36.634 --> 03:39.000
Ha, ha.

03:39.095 --> 03:42.838
So, the lovely voicemail you left me,

03:42.932 --> 03:45.890
Lachlan's champion,
some evil thing coming for us?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.841
I'm sorry. I was so
distracted before you left,

03:47.937 --> 03:50.644
but Lachlan had just dumped
some pretty heavy stuff on me.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.108
Do I need to go and
finally kick his Ashy ass?

03:53.192 --> 03:56.229
Actually, I think he and
l are on the same side.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.902
I'm sorry.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.651
I thought you just said that Lachlan,

04:01.742 --> 04:05.485
that massive a-hole, is on our side.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.538
It's pretty confusing and
I will tell you all about it.

04:09.625 --> 04:14.790
But first, how was life
on the road with Nate?

04:14.880 --> 04:19.044
Just god-awful. He's such a drag.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.966
I can't wait to get to know him.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.341
Yeah. What about you
and Mr. Orgasms Before O.J.?

04:24.432 --> 04:26.764
--Ryan.
--Mhm.

04:26.851 --> 04:32.391
He's um... well, he's a...

04:32.481 --> 04:34.563
Oh, are you blushing?

04:34.650 --> 04:37.813
What in the world could possibly
make a succubus blush?

04:37.903 --> 04:39.404
I've got to get to know him better.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.444
Well, why don't the four
of us go for lunch?

04:41.532 --> 04:42.863
Like a double-date?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.986
Yeah. Why not?

04:45.077 --> 04:48.535
Good food, good wine,
good conversation.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.203
Just like grown-ups.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.282
It'll be fun.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.207
Okay.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.956
I'll set it up.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.246
--Hey.
--Easy!

04:59.341 --> 05:01.047
Hands where I can see them!

05:01.135 --> 05:02.716
Hands now.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.384
Okay.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.423
--This little guy right here...
--Yeah.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.510
...fits inside a cell phone,
could take out an entire city block.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.846
Cool, huh?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.682
Well, there's nothing like
a guy who enjoys his work.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.232
Whoa.

05:21.071 --> 05:25.110
So, I was thinking we
should go out on a date.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.907
--l was thinking the same thing.
--Yeah?

05:26.994 --> 05:30.532
Yeah. And a client of mine,
he's got this great vineyard in Napa.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.612
I think this weekend--

05:31.707 --> 05:33.322
Well, that does sound tempting,

05:33.417 --> 05:36.250
but I was thinking more about
going out with Kenzi and Nate.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.577
--Your roommate?
--Uh huh.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.786
And her boyfriend?

05:38.881 --> 05:41.918
Well, don't sound so excited.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.716
You're right. Napa can wait.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.089
Well, good because this
human is my best friend.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.048
Oh, your B.F.F. Well, then...

05:50.142 --> 05:51.723
...I really want to meet her.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.095
Are you sure?

05:53.187 --> 05:54.302
Yes. It'll be fun.

05:54.396 --> 05:58.935
Think about it, humans at lunch
instead of humans for lunch.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.108
Ah!

06:01.195 --> 06:02.776
l was kidding. Kidding.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.774
--Are you sure?
--Sort of.

06:08.285 --> 06:12.073
I keep telling you this bogus
arrest is never going to hold up.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.495
I keep telling you to shut up.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.867
It was entrapment.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.915
Entrapment means that
you were persuaded.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.870
Nobody persuaded you to con
16-year-olds into jacking cars.

06:20.965 --> 06:22.830
Can't prove that.
You have nothing to hold me.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.461
Jack, are you all right?

06:24.552 --> 06:25.758
Jack is under arrest.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.176
This is my son. I need to talk with him.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.050
Well, you can speak to him
after he's been processed.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.391
Dad, l'm innocent.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.466
But I wanted to speak with my son!

06:33.561 --> 06:35.802
You'll want to remove your hand!

06:35.896 --> 06:38.683
I need five minutes alone with my son!

06:39.817 --> 06:41.102
How about a whole night in a cell?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.649
Dyson!

06:43.487 --> 06:44.818
Let go.

06:46.323 --> 06:50.987
You've no idea the trouble
you just bought yourself.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.534
Let's go.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.493
What the hell are you thinking?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.328
Oh, like he's not asking for it.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.414
His kid's running an
under-age auto theft ring.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.499
So, you take it out on his old man?

07:06.594 --> 07:09.711
Tired of these people thinking
they're above the law.

07:09.805 --> 07:13.013
Look, you're tired a lot lately, so...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.842
I'm fine.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.473
Good.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.976
'Cause another problem
just landed on our desks.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.398
Some old man died of a heart attack.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.474
Yeah, and?

07:24.570 --> 07:27.027
And he had strange
wounds on his neck.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.107
And his dental records match
those of a 22-year-old backpacker.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.237
Now I'm thinking it's Fae,
but it's nothing I recognize,

07:33.329 --> 07:35.820
so I was going to go down
to Trick, see if he knows.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.120
Good for you.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.619
You're not coming?

07:39.710 --> 07:42.122
Dyson, my office now.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.045
Guess not.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.587
I'm sorry we didn't get
a chance to talk sooner.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.509
I'm just glad we're talking now.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.178
In the coming days,
open communication

07:53.265 --> 07:55.381
is going to become
increasingly important.

07:55.476 --> 07:59.560
We have to make sure
that we align our strategies.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.603
l was told you were down here.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.770
Am I interrupting?

08:02.858 --> 08:05.474
--We're just chatting.
--Yeah.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.026
Something came across
my desk that smells Fae.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.856
Cole Masters, 22-year-old
backpacker from London.

08:11.950 --> 08:16.444
He died this morning...
looking like this.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.997
That is some hard living for 22.

08:21.085 --> 08:25.579
The wound could indicate a Serket,
but that's highly unusual behaviour.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.537
How so?

08:26.632 --> 08:31.251
Serkets usually thrive
on giving life, healing,

08:31.345 --> 08:34.382
restoring vitality and youthfulness.

08:34.473 --> 08:37.590
Killing goes against
everything they stand for.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.347
With all that's been happening lately,

08:41.438 --> 08:43.599
it would be good to get
the specifics on this.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.556
Yeah.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.983
I can handle it.

08:48.070 --> 08:52.234
I think it would be best
if Bo handled this one.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.201
Whatever the Blood King says.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.621
Here's all we've got,
including last known address.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.075
Great. I'm on it.

09:08.841 --> 09:12.208
And I looked up that place that
Ryan is taking us to for lunch.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.588
It used to be a neighbourhood bar
and now you've got to make reservations,

09:14.680 --> 09:16.216
like, three months in advance.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.890
The menu is insane
and the prices are ridic.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.969
He is paying, right? I mean,
since he picked the place.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.849
Yes, I assume he is paying.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.022
Good. 'Cause otherwise,
Nate and I would have to share

09:27.109 --> 09:31.068
a side salad and a glass
of water and I'm not a sharer.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.655
Now I know what
teen spirit smells like.

09:35.743 --> 09:39.031
We're friends of Cole Masters.
Did you know him?

09:39.121 --> 09:43.865
Um... why don't you talk to Tony?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.620
He's up there.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.590
Tony?

09:55.345 --> 09:58.929
Hey. How you doing?

09:59.016 --> 10:00.677
Man, I don't have a clue.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.555
So, you were the one who found Cole?

10:03.645 --> 10:06.182
Yeah. I didn't even
know that it was him.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.811
He was old, but he was
still young, you know?

10:09.902 --> 10:12.484
Were you guys close?

10:12.571 --> 10:15.563
We met awhile back. Yeah.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.865
We just kept kind of running into each
other like backpackers always seem to.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.408
--You know?
--Yeah.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.408
We were going to meet here
and then go on to Amsterdam.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.784
But Cole never showed?

10:24.875 --> 10:29.039
No, he did. He showed on Sunday with
this chick that he met in Costa Rica.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.289
Was she his girlfriend?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.541
Girlfriend, no. More like a leech.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.965
She's always trying to
hit him up for money.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.589
She's one of these girls
who says that she's authentic,

10:37.679 --> 10:40.056
but all she wanted to do was party.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.011
This is her and Cole.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.308
Is she here? Can we speak to her?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.266
She took off. You can talk
to her if you can find her.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.147
Okay. Well...

10:55.364 --> 11:00.449
...if you see her again,
you get her to call me, okay?

11:00.536 --> 11:02.572
She's not going to be back.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.158
She's in the wind, like the rest of them.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.740
What does that mean?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.121
Over the last month, there have
been three or four backpackers

11:10.212 --> 11:12.498
who checked in here and
then suddenly disappeared.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.580
Yeah, but they're
backpackers, they travel.

11:14.675 --> 11:18.338
No, but they didn't have the cash.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.759
I don't know.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.010
Maybe they just got homesick.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.012
You lose track of people
on the road, you know.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.934
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.972
Okay, thanks, Tony.
You take care, okay?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.182
[KENZI] Thanks, man.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.733
Yeah.

11:40.826 --> 11:44.660
Hale, turns out this thing
with Cole is not an isolated case.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.159
Sounds like some Fae has
a taste for young vagabonds.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.126
Well, that's too bad.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.590
Yeah, okay, I'll talk to you later.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.663
What's too bad?

11:56.758 --> 11:59.044
Don't you dare tell me that
Ryan is cancelling lunch.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.421
No, it was Hale.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.798
He got a hit on Delphine's credit card.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.223
Turns out she boarded a bus
last night for San Francisco.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.175
So, what can we do?

12:08.270 --> 12:09.851
Well...

12:09.938 --> 12:13.271
I guess I'll head back to the hostel
and see if I can turn over any new leads.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.521
But not until after lunch, right?

12:16.612 --> 12:19.649
Because a girl's got to eat and
it would just be rude to cancel.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.150
Yes, after lunch.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.617
Okay. Heading over to Nate's.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.066
No snacking.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.447
Not on food, anyway.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.536
Dyson, I got your suspension
papers on my desk.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.167
What the hell got into you?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.838
The man grabbed me, Garrity.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.962
Last I heard, that's called
assaulting an officer.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.294
That man happens to play
golf with the mayor and--

12:43.388 --> 12:45.128
So what, a membership
at a country club

12:45.223 --> 12:47.179
and a low handicap make
you above the law?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.383
No. But it does give him
some very powerful friends

12:49.478 --> 12:52.060
who decide to drop the
charges against his son.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.184
--You got to be kidding me.
--Do I look like I'm kidding?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.436
Thanks to you, our six-month
investigation of the carjacking ring

12:57.527 --> 12:58.437
is back to square one.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.565
That is not my fault. You tell
the mayor to grow some balls.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.646
Oh, Dyson.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.857
Oh, you know what, next time | see him,
I'll be sure to pass that along

13:04.952 --> 13:06.283
and tell him it came from you.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.735
Don't bother, I'll tell him myself.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.037
Like I said, suspended,
pending a full investigation.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.740
--We're done?
--Use the time to cool off.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.789
Look, our friends are coming, okay.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.838
Just check your book.
Ryan something and Bo.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.165
I'm sure it's right there.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.002
I'm sorry, but without a name,
there's nothing I can do.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.553
Kenzi.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.504
--Hi.
--Hey.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.884
He , |'m sorr we're late.
Y

13:28.976 --> 13:32.184
|t's valets, you know, they keep
fighting over who gets to park my car.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.601
Oh, what do you drive?

13:33.689 --> 13:34.974
Oh, depends on the day of the week.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.306
--Marissa, hi.
--Mr. Lambert!

13:37.401 --> 13:39.062
Great to see you again.

13:39.152 --> 13:43.942
These are some very special
friends of mine, Bo, Kenzi, Nate.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.897
Pleasure to meet you.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.485
She's gorgeous.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.036
Thank you.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.328
Your usual table?

13:59.423 --> 14:04.963
Lead the way. I hope you guys are
ready for a fantastic meal. Hm?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.759
Can I just say your
boyfriend is awesome.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.589
I'm, like, one jewelry case snap
away from giggling like Julia Roberts.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.423
I know. He's pretty great, right.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.010
[KENZI] Oh, hot damn.
I'm going to start with the lobster,

14:15.105 --> 14:19.189
oh, wow, with the lobster puffs and
then I will have the lobster rolls and--

14:19.276 --> 14:20.686
--Madam.
--Please, please, please let there be...

14:20.777 --> 14:24.190
...yes! I will finish with the
lobster ice cream. Thank you.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.398
Actually, I took the liberty of
ordering for the entire table already.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.948
You what?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.527
Pre-ordered. The chef's a
close personal friend of mine.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.236
He's going to take care of us.
Don't you worry.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.243
Besides, we'll all be so drunk
by then, we'll barely notice.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.494
I like the way you think.

14:37.586 --> 14:41.295
Marissa. We're going to
need wine and lots of it.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.043
Do you have the '49
Richebourg Grand Cru?

14:44.134 --> 14:45.590
Tell me yes.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.259
Oh, I'm so sorry, we ran out.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.213
Oh, you're breaking
my heart here, sweetie.

14:51.308 --> 14:55.096
l was there when it was bottled.
It is unbelievable.

14:55.187 --> 14:58.054
Okay. We'll take a bottle
of your best champagne.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.139
l'll order the wine later.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.230
She's beautiful.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.027
--She is.
--And she's one of us.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.854
--Really?
--Yeah.

15:09.117 --> 15:14.862
Guys, I know it's kind of cheesy,
but I would like to propose a toast.

15:14.956 --> 15:19.199
Here's to new experiences
and new friends.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.079
Here, here.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.039
--Cheers.
--Cheers.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.506
A toast with water.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.423
Nate, I'm looking forward
to getting to know you.

15:32.724 --> 15:37.718
So, um, it's a hundred, right?

15:43.860 --> 15:45.566
Just relax.

15:54.913 --> 15:59.122
[gasping]

16:09.511 --> 16:12.469
So, by the time that | get
back, this guy is so drunk--

16:12.556 --> 16:15.138
--So drunk.
--that he's passed out on the stage.

16:15.225 --> 16:20.640
Yeah, Nate had to finish his whole
final set with him just lying there.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.688
I don't get it. Why didn't you just
call security and have him removed?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.481
I don't know, babe.
Why didn't we call security?

16:25.569 --> 16:29.778
Security? Well, there's actually
only fifteen people there, so...

16:29.865 --> 16:34.325
Wait. This whole story that you've been
telling was about a gig for fifteen people?

16:34.411 --> 16:38.154
Actually, for Cedar Rapids on
a Tuesday, that is, like, amazing.

16:38.248 --> 16:41.866
No, I don't doubt that, actually, but how
is this possibly worth your time, exactly?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.621
I mean, how much money could
you have possibly made on that,

16:43.712 --> 16:44.701
--a hundred bucks, maybe?
--Ryan.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.455
Yeah?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.791
--Fifty-five.
--Fifty-five.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.215
Hey, Ritchie Rich,
it's not about the money.

16:50.302 --> 16:52.338
No, Nate is doing what he loves.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.636
Totally. That's great.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.762
But, listen, l have no doubt that
you will be successful at it one day.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.592
I think it's pretty fair to say that

17:00.687 --> 17:03.850
Ryan's a little out of touch
with the indie music scene.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.726
--Was I being a jerk?
--Yes, you were being a jerk.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.193
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.110
No worries, man, you should come
out to one of my shows sometime.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.232
--Absolutely.
--[KENZ|] Yeah.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.733
--Ohl
__ B '
[ 0] Food, greatI

17:12.824 --> 17:16.191
Great! Okay, so the
ritual with these things,

17:16.286 --> 17:20.780
put them all in your mouth at once
and let the flavours overwhelm you.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.034
Is this skunk?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.491
Oh, just wait 'til you try it.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.042
Go, go, go.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.501
Okay, so thoughts?

17:37.098 --> 17:39.384
It tastes like something
crawled in the food and died.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.968
That's because it did. It's tripe.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.644
Cow's stomach lining.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.562
Stomach lining?

17:46.650 --> 17:48.606
I thought I'd challenge
your taste buds a little bit.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.355
--I will tell you what's been a challenge.
--Kenzi!

17:51.446 --> 17:52.777
[cell phone ringing]

17:52.864 --> 17:54.946
Oh, hey, Tony.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.773
Wait. Slow down.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.699
I'll be right over.

17:58.787 --> 18:02.029
Guys, I'm sorry. I have to go.
But I just got a lead on a big case.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.078
I don't want to break up the party

18:03.166 --> 18:04.827
so stay and have fun and
get to know each other.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.034
No, actually, we are
just about done here.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.505
--No, Kenzi. Please, please just stay.
--[KENZ|] Yes!

18:09.589 --> 18:13.923
Just talk to Marissa,
she'll bring the car around front.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.423
I'll be there in a moment. Thanks.

18:17.514 --> 18:21.348
Look, I know this was absolutely
no fun for you guys, and I'm sorry.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.140
It is totally my fault.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.934
I never should have
ordered the food for you.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.728
Never should have chosen
such a pretentious restaurant.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.855
l was just trying to impress
you guys and make Bo happy.

18:31.945 --> 18:36.530
So, please do me a favour. Stay.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.607
Order a few drinks.
Maybe something to eat.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.533
Lobster rolls. Thank you.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.362
Lobster, yes.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.664
And l have a surprise for you.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.537
l've arranged for a friend
of mine to drop by.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.711
She's an agent. She can
open some doors for you.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.873
What do you think?

18:54.968 --> 18:59.177
Are you kidding me?
That would be awesome.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.756
Great. Anything for
friends of Bo's. Enjoy.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.395
Can you believe this? A face-to-face
meeting with an actual agent?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.391
That's incredible.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.019
Yeah. Yeah, incredible.

19:16.781 --> 19:17.896
What are we doing here, exactly?

19:17.991 --> 19:21.324
Well, I am here for a case. You can
wait outside if you don't like it.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.652
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm dying to watch you work.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.203
Come on.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.290
--Hey.
--Hi. Thank you for coming back.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.583
Where is she?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.082
You just passed her on the way in.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.136
Delphine?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.015
Delphine, wait!

19:46.102 --> 19:48.479
Oh, we're running now.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.193
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.645
Relax, okay.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.482
We're not going to hurt you.
We just have a few questions.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.706
Better?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.158
Yeah.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.958
That's amazing.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.746
Who are you guys?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.671
We're friends of Cole's.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.171
We're just trying to figure out
what happened to him.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.547
I'm so sorry.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.130
This is all my fault.

20:25.225 --> 20:30.140
|just--| wanted to go to see the
Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, you know,

20:30.230 --> 20:32.266
but we didn't have enough money.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.847
And then we heard about this place

20:33.942 --> 20:35.682
where some of the other
backpackers were going.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.393
--What kind of place?
--A clinic.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.980
They do medical testing
in exchange for cash.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.238
Cole thought it wasn't safe.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.115
And I kept pushing him.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.369
I swear I had no idea
anything would happen.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.246
And then... then he died.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.703
Why didn't you just call the police?

20:59.217 --> 21:01.424
I got scared.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.844
I figured if| left, I could
put this all behind me.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.138
But I couldn't.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.557
I had to come back
and warn everybody.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.509
Where is this clinic?

21:17.652 --> 21:19.267
Do you think this is edible?

21:19.362 --> 21:20.943
Probably.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.897
Yeah, I'm definitely feeling
better about our man Ryan now.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.778
Here, have some cheesecake.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.198
Is this agent coming?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.325
Well, why would Ryan lie about that?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.452
I don't know. 'Cause he
likes messing with people.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.330
He got us to eat cow
from the inside out.

21:36.421 --> 21:40.039
His loss because we just racked
up a grand on his credit card.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.919
Seriously, you got to try some of this.

21:42.010 --> 21:45.719
--But I'm so full.
--Oh, just one little bite.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.261
Right?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.011
[KENZI] Oh my god.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.138
Can we get, like, six
more of those to go?

21:53.229 --> 21:55.390
Well, hello.

21:55.482 --> 21:59.441
You must be Ryan's
incredibly talented friend.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.783
This is where the backpackers
are coming for quick cash?

22:08.870 --> 22:11.828
Not exactly like I pictured it.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.783
Have fun in St. Bart's and we'll
see you again in a couple weeks.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.868
Hello. Can I help you?

22:17.962 --> 22:19.463
--Yes, hi.
--Hi.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.038
We're new to the neighbourhood
and saw your sign.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.998
So nice of you to stop by.

22:24.093 --> 22:27.677
Well, you know, you can never be too
rich or too pretty. Right, sugar plum?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.551
Yes. Is this some kind of spa?

22:30.642 --> 22:34.555
Well, actually, we like to think of
ourselves more as a rejuvenation clinic.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.183
A place where people can go
to feel good about themselves.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.558
What kind of treatments do you offer?

22:38.650 --> 22:41.107
A wide variety.
But our most popular by far

22:41.194 --> 22:43.435
is our one-of-a-kind
anti-aging treatment.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.395
Oh. Anti-aging.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.946
Well, I would like to
hear more about that.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.241
That's right. Got to
keep her looking young.

22:50.328 --> 22:55.539
Well, it's an old, old, old family recipe.
Guaranteed to add years to your life.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.240
Well, what's in it?

22:57.335 --> 22:59.997
See, I'm only asking because I'm
concerned about medical testing.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.624
Is it tested on animals or humans?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.000
No. No, nothing like that.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.128
Well, where does it come from?
Is it all natural?

23:06.219 --> 23:08.210
The best thing for you would be to
call back and make an appointment.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.010
Well, actually, I'm free right now.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.261
Unfortunately, we're
booked up for weeks.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.182
| see.

23:15.270 --> 23:19.183
Well, thank you for your time.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.119
You'll never guess who just came in.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.445
Ryan Lambert.

23:35.540 --> 23:38.498
And I think he had that
unaligned succubus with him.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.745
Well, what did they want?

23:39.836 --> 23:40.996
What do you think they wanted?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.668
They were asking questions
about the treatment,

23:42.755 --> 23:46.748
all because you let that
little backpacker escape.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.175
--|'m sorry, Hessa.
--|t's too late for that now.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.550
I sent them away, but I guarantee
you they will come back.

23:52.640 --> 23:56.303
And when they do,
you need to be ready.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.941
I'd be willing to bet that I've made the
careers of half the people on your iPod.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.272
That's amazing.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.358
Yeah. That's amazing.

24:13.453 --> 24:17.662
First thing we need to do is raise
your profile. Appearances, mash-ups,

24:17.749 --> 24:22.209
get that cute little face of yours
out there for the whole world to see.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.752
We can work out the details later.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.251
But you have to want this.

24:27.342 --> 24:32.302
I do. Totally. I've waited my whole
life for an opportunity like this.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.596
Perfect. Then we can go to my
office and sign the paperwork.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.514
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.594
Kenz, what's wrong?

24:40.688 --> 24:43.395
You know, don't you
want to hear him play

24:43.483 --> 24:46.099
so you can really appreciate
the awesomeness of his talent?

24:46.194 --> 24:47.730
Oh, honey.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.277
I can tell he's talented
just by looking at him.

24:50.365 --> 24:53.653
Yes, but he is incredible live.

24:53.743 --> 24:58.828
Oh, isn't she so cute?
She just wants what's best for you.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.332
Fine. Go fetch your guitar.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.501
But be in my office in
an hour. Don't be late.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.499
Done.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.205
Stay with me.

25:09.300 --> 25:13.964
| feel like a martini
and I hate to drink alone.

25:14.055 --> 25:16.592
Sure. Who can say no to that?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.048
Kenz, |'|| catch you later?

25:18.142 --> 25:19.598
Okay.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.302
Well, that was fun.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.683
Like hell.

25:24.774 --> 25:27.311
That is my boyfriend
and you can't have him.

25:27.402 --> 25:31.441
Oh, wow, such fierceness. l have chills.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.692
But I'm afraid you're
mistaken, sweetheart.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.490
Didn't you just see him run out
of here all pink-cheeked and excited?

25:36.577 --> 25:38.408
Seems to me he's already said yes.

25:38.496 --> 25:41.659
Oh, no, that wasn't a yes.
That was a confused maybe.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.580
We'll see.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.408
I don't think he's
going to let a contract

25:45.503 --> 25:49.212
get in the way of what
his heart desires most.

25:52.969 --> 25:55.551
I'm sorry, buttercu p,

25:55.638 --> 25:59.426
but that's just the way our
world works. You know that.

25:59.517 --> 26:05.683
| get what I want,
and you get left behind.

26:17.410 --> 26:21.653
Well, so much for the clinic, huh?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.080
You know, if we hurry, we can
make it to Napa by morning.

26:24.167 --> 26:28.877
Have you ever seen the sun rise
from a balloon over the Napa Valley?

26:28.963 --> 26:29.713
It is gorgeous.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.418
Hessa was lying to us.
She's hiding something.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.715
Maybe. What are you
going to do about it?

26:34.802 --> 26:35.712
I'm going to go back in and take

26:35.803 --> 26:37.634
--No.
--one more look around. Okay?

26:37.722 --> 26:40.589
Just five minutes and then we
will do something fun. I promise.

26:40.683 --> 26:41.593
--Really?
--Uh huh.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.185
--Promise?
--Uh huh.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.555
[cell phone ringing]

26:45.646 --> 26:47.602
Sorry.

26:47.690 --> 26:48.600
Waiting for this call.

26:48.691 --> 26:49.806
--Five minutes.
--Take five. Take five.

26:49.901 --> 26:53.359
Only five or I'm leaving without you.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.482
Mister Odinga, how can I be of service?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.200
Sir?

27:02.997 --> 27:03.907
You got a minute?

27:03.998 --> 27:05.408
What's up, Hale?

27:05.500 --> 27:09.038
Look, I know Dyson can be
a pain in the ass sometimes,

27:09.128 --> 27:10.914
--but he's a good cop.
--Is he?

27:11.005 --> 27:13.621
Seems to me he's got issues.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.217
He's had a tough time lately.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.416
We all got problems.

27:16.511 --> 27:19.924
Doesn't mean that we can take
them out on anyone we want.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.049
I know.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.756
But, sir, look, Dyson and I,
we work well together.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.512
We have the best arrest
record in the division.

27:25.603 --> 27:27.434
Can't you cut him some slack?

27:27.522 --> 27:29.058
I'll keep him in line from now on.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.060
Seriously? You're going to put your
badge on the line for this joker?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.642
'Cause next time he screws up,
it's going to be on you.

27:34.737 --> 27:37.900
And I'm not going to be
able to protect you.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.697
I'm aware of that.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.571
All right, suit yourself.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.745
|'|| recommend Dyson be reinstated.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.323
I hope you know what
you're doing, detective.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.585
Any chance for a walk-in appointment?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.796
Then tell me what the
hell's going on here.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.474
Told you she'd be back.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.351
Yes.

28:54.442 --> 28:57.024
Well, don't just stand
there, prep the table.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.352
We've got ourselves a new donor.

29:10.207 --> 29:14.075
Don't bother. I made sure
they were extra tight.

29:14.170 --> 29:17.207
It's a classy operation
you got going on here.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.254
Let me guess--you're both Serkets?

29:19.342 --> 29:21.082
How well-informed of you.

29:21.177 --> 29:25.170
l have to say it's a pretty shaky
interpretation of giving life.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.348
Of course we give life to those who pay.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.552
The rest, well, they
serve a different purpose.

29:32.647 --> 29:35.855
Supply for your demand?

29:35.942 --> 29:37.648
Are you onboard with this?

29:37.735 --> 29:40.772
Killing innocent kids so that trophy
wives can fit their bikinis better?

29:40.863 --> 29:43.149
It wasn't always like this.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.198
We used to just take
a few years at a time.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.617
Shut up, Lana.

29:48.704 --> 29:53.323
My poor sister, so soft-hearted.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.668
Take care of her.

29:54.752 --> 29:55.787
But she's Fae.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.960
Just do it.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.046
Lana, you don't want to do this.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.845
Lana, let's just talk about this, okay?

30:19.235 --> 30:24.650
There has got to be something you'll
take in his place. Perfume, tequila?

30:24.740 --> 30:29.325
My cousin just obtained a truckload
of Spanx at a very, very good price.

30:29.412 --> 30:33.530
Are you done trying to postpone
the inevitable, little girl?

30:33.624 --> 30:35.034
You are the leader of the Dark Fae.

30:35.126 --> 30:38.459
You could have anybody.
Why does it have to be Nate?

30:41.549 --> 30:44.586
Besides, I think he could be really
great if his little groupie girlfriend

30:44.677 --> 30:47.043
would stop trying to shackle
him to the human world.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.629
Give me a break.
You're just trying to mess with me.

30:49.724 --> 30:52.761
I admit that's an amusing side benefit,

30:52.852 --> 30:56.845
especially given your relationship
with my favourite succubus.

30:56.939 --> 30:59.851
Bo has nothing to do with this.

30:59.942 --> 31:05.562
This is about me and Nate,
and I intend to get him out of this.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.942
Name your price.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.820
Darling, you can't afford me.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.071
Whatever it takes, it's worth it.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.955
Anything I want?

31:17.043 --> 31:18.658
Absolutely.

31:18.753 --> 31:22.496
Except, you know, can we please stay
away from the whole firstborn area?

31:22.590 --> 31:24.626
'Cause I really don't think
I want to go through with the--

31:24.717 --> 31:28.084
with the screaming and the, you know.

31:28.179 --> 31:33.390
How about this--you'll owe me.

31:33.476 --> 31:34.841
Owe you?

31:34.935 --> 31:37.426
Owe me.

31:37.521 --> 31:41.935
One favour, collectible
at my discretion.

31:42.026 --> 31:45.234
Whatever I want. No questions asked.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.981
Either that or I'll just go
meet with Nate right now.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.691
And believe me,

31:51.786 --> 31:57.873
I intend to take full advantage
of the client-agency relationship.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.916
Fine! Deal.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.836
Wonderful. I guess I'll be going.

32:05.257 --> 32:10.923
I leave it to you to tell him that he
wasn't good enough for the big time.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.132
Enjoy that.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.199
That's it.

fries the brain of its intended victim.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.424
But it's quick and painless.

32:50.511 --> 32:54.379
Least I think it is. I haven't really
had a chance to test it... yet.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.556
Let her go.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.265
That was a wise choice.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.392
You all right?

33:04.441 --> 33:05.977
Yeah. I'm good.

33:08.362 --> 33:09.602
Give it back.

33:09.697 --> 33:13.531
No. No, no, no. Them first.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.319
Hey, you look amazing and all.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.326
In fact, I'm finding out that I'm curiously
attracted to older women right now,

33:21.417 --> 33:22.532
but come on!

33:22.626 --> 33:24.537
What? What, 'cause they're human?

33:24.628 --> 33:26.835
Give them their years back now!

33:26.922 --> 33:28.298
I don't think so.

33:28.382 --> 33:33.217
You know, I may be older,
but I can still kick your ass.

33:33.304 --> 33:36.717
I'm afraid you've misread
the situation, my dear.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.423
For one thing, we're Dark Fae.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.850
And, for another...

33:41.937 --> 33:43.473
--...so is he.
--So what?

33:43.564 --> 33:46.351
So, he's never going to side with
an unaligned succubus to save them

33:46.442 --> 33:48.057
over members of his own clan.

33:48.152 --> 33:51.815
Nice try, but Ryan
doesn't play that game.

33:51.906 --> 33:55.865
Actually, they haven't really
done anything wrong have they?

33:55.951 --> 33:59.114
I mean, with the humans,
other than maybe a sloppy feed?

33:59.205 --> 34:00.365
Are you kidding me right now?

34:00.456 --> 34:03.198
--[RYAN] Look, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.
--[BO] Is this some kind of joke?

34:03.292 --> 34:05.829
You don't have a side, I do.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.377
Oh.

34:09.465 --> 34:13.128
In case there was any further debate.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.961
--Sorry.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.467
Finish the job.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.298
What you should have
done in the first place.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.760
But once again, this is all your fault!

34:31.362 --> 34:35.401
Wow. She runs you like a servant, huh?

34:35.491 --> 34:38.153
Lana and l have been
together our whole lives.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.280
She knows her place.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.913
How do you put up with it, Lana?

34:45.000 --> 34:49.039
Constantly being told what to do?
Never living your own life?

34:50.881 --> 34:53.463
Haven't you had enough?

34:53.550 --> 34:56.542
Oh, for god sakes, I'll do it myself.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.262
What are you doing?

35:00.349 --> 35:03.091
I should have stood up
to you years ago.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.801
Have you lost your mind?

35:08.357 --> 35:10.393
Lana, let's talk about this, okay?

35:10.484 --> 35:12.020
No more talk.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.942
I'm your little sister.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.649
You're supposed to take care of me.

35:20.744 --> 35:24.703
But instead, you made me drain
those kids so you could get rich.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.416
Thank you.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.716

to do that by myself.

wouldn't even see me.

the next minute it's white.

36:06.206 --> 36:11.667

restaurant, it doesn't make sense.

36:14.423 --> 36:18.462
No, no, it's not. Don't think that.
Don't ever think that.

Then what?

36:19.553 --> 36:21.885
Then what, because I have been
waiting for years for a chance like this,

knowing what I did wrong.

to get a bajillion chances

make bank off your awesomeness.

Okay?

36:37.029 --> 36:38.519
Sure.

36:38.614 --> 36:42.027
Trust me. I know.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.735
Okay, but in the meantime,
you have dodged a bullet.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.787
I mean, come on, she was
going to turn you into some

36:48.874 --> 36:53.243
lip-syncing dance monkey.
Next stop, the Tween Crap Awards.

36:55.798 --> 36:58.505
l'm... I'm really sorry.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.629
Oh, it's not like you
had anything to do with it.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.711
| just got to wear it.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.271
We need to talk.

37:18.362 --> 37:19.727
What's up?

37:19.822 --> 37:23.406
Your boy-toy sent
the Morrigan to sign Nate.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.448
--When?
--After you left.

37:25.536 --> 37:27.743
I barely managed to get him out of it.

37:27.830 --> 37:28.819
What did you do?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.529
I had to promise her some giant favour

37:30.624 --> 37:33.240
to be named at some
terrifying future date.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.826
I am so sorry, Kenzi.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.583
Yeah, well, Nate almost got
talent-sucked into oblivion.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.665
I can't believe that Ryan would do this.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.374
Why is he even talking to her?

37:42.469 --> 37:46.303
Isn't that, like, illegal or something?

37:46.390 --> 37:48.255
Actually, no.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.427
Ryan is Dark Fae.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.183
And you knew that?

37:55.274 --> 37:57.185
Look, I'm going to take care of this.

37:57.276 --> 38:01.485
Okay? I'm going to go over there
right now and rearrange his parts.

38:01.572 --> 38:06.111
And tell him you're through, right?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.362
Bo, come on, you know I like it

38:08.454 --> 38:11.287
when you're getting your
hunger all hitched up, okay.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.988
But this guy is obviously bad news.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.619
I know.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.785
I know.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.710
That's what makes this so hard.

38:39.651 --> 38:44.361
Guess who suddenly walked into the
station all terrified and gave himself up?

38:44.448 --> 38:46.860
Jack Everett.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.781
Well, I guess he had a change of heart.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.700
Oh, you think so?

38:50.787 --> 38:53.745
'Cause I think someone
just talked him into it.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.413
We had a chat.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.786
Used your wolf, didn't you?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.287
Why would I do something like that?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.505
Where's your head? Huh?

39:00.589 --> 39:03.797
It's not enough to break human laws?
You got to go break Fae laws, as well?

39:03.884 --> 39:06.717
I didn't use my wolf.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.794
Not that it's any of your business.

39:08.889 --> 39:12.757
The hell it isn't any of my business.
I put my ass on the line to save your job.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.228
Garrity reinstated you because of me.

39:15.312 --> 39:18.475
I didn't ask you to do that.

39:18.565 --> 39:22.808
Tell me, what were you
going to do? Get fired?

39:22.903 --> 39:27.317
How were you planning on
explaining that one to the Ash?

39:27.407 --> 39:30.740
That's the thing, Hale,

39:30.827 --> 39:34.991
I'm done explaining myself to anyone.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.127
--Hey.
--Hey.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.379
Thanks for calling.
And thanks for deciding to come.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.711
I've got something for you, just--

39:50.806 --> 39:53.548
Ryan, I'm not in the mood.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.270
Kenzi told me about the Morrigan.

40:00.357 --> 40:01.472
And...?

40:01.567 --> 40:03.523
And?

40:03.610 --> 40:06.647
l was trying to do her
boyfriend a favour.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.899
You know that Evony makes
people's careers, right?

40:08.991 --> 40:10.231
Yeah, until they die.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.316
We all have to die sometime.

40:12.411 --> 40:14.026
Nate's an amateur guitar player.

40:14.121 --> 40:17.284
He plays two-bit coffee
houses for 55 bucks a week.

40:17.374 --> 40:21.959
Evony could have him selling out
Madison Square Garden in six months.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.205
You don't think he'd want that?

40:23.297 --> 40:24.958
Well, that is not your decision to make.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.710
It's not yours either.

40:27.801 --> 40:30.213
I gave the kid an opportunity.

40:30.304 --> 40:34.047
Who are you to say
what's best for him?

40:34.141 --> 40:35.631
--|t's not just that.
--No?

40:35.726 --> 40:40.766
No. You were fine letting
those sisters walk.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.687
l'm Dark Fae.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.026
I made my choice of
clan a long time ago.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.520
I stand by that choice.

40:46.612 --> 40:50.400
You, on the other hand,
you're free to choose.

40:50.490 --> 40:54.483
You can choose Light or
Dark whenever it suits you,

40:54.578 --> 40:58.196
which I think is really awesome,
by the way, if you'd ever actually do it.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.871
What is that supposed to mean?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.789
You call yourself unaligned,

41:01.877 --> 41:04.960
and yet, you spend all of your time
with your Light Fae friends,

41:05.047 --> 41:08.005
you never really give
Dark Fae a chance.

41:08.091 --> 41:10.298
And I think somewhere
way down deep inside,

41:10.385 --> 41:13.218
that you think Light are
good and Dark are bad.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.091
I know what I think.

41:15.182 --> 41:17.548
The Dark treat human like property.

41:17.643 --> 41:21.352
Yeah. And the Light don't, right?

41:21.438 --> 41:27.229
Yet Lachlan puts your good friend,
Lauren, in a prison cell for days.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.438
I know about that.

41:32.532 --> 41:36.195
And you today, you manipulate
someone's chi to make your job easier.

41:36.286 --> 41:40.905
Isn't that like playing
with your food? I think it is.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.115
Listen, |'m notjudging you.

41:43.210 --> 41:48.170
I am into you no matter
what you decide.

41:48.256 --> 41:52.875
But I would really love to know what
would happen if you just let go...

41:52.969 --> 41:56.882
...of everything, except me.

42:00.644 --> 42:05.855
Ohh. I'm trying very hard
to stay mad at you right now.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.523
You're going to have to
work a little harder.

42:09.903 --> 42:13.612
I want you to forget Lachlan.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.235
Yeah.

42:15.325 --> 42:19.238
Just forget about
Light Fae and Dark Fae.

42:19.329 --> 42:22.071
Forget about making a choice.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.781
This is about you and me...

42:28.714 --> 42:30.250
...and her.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.669
Hello, again.

42:35.679 --> 42:38.341
I wanted to get you a present.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.682
Well, it's a good one.

42:42.769 --> 42:45.260
No rules, remember?

43:28.774 --> 43:30.230
Me?

43:32.611 --> 43:34.351
Thought you'd never ask.
