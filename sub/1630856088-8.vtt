WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.095
Stop.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.473
You're just mad because he takes after me.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.475
Of course I am. It's not fair.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.352
Look, he's obviously got your brains.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.895
Yeah, obviously.

00:19.895 --> 00:23.190
And he'll be blessed with my
gravity-defying breaking curveball.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.858
Oh, my God.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.986
- Not the curveball again.
- Yes, the curveball.

00:27.986 --> 00:32.115
I mean, look, your brains, my arm.
It's the best of both worlds.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.535
Kid's gonna be a god.

00:38.956 --> 00:39.957
I just miss him.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.835
This is hard.

00:42.835 --> 00:43.919
Yeah, I know.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.004
I miss him too.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.300
Do you think we'll be home
before Hiroshi's birthday?

00:51.635 --> 00:52.636
Lee?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.597
Lee?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.186
Colonel.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.647
Colonel?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.482
Yeah, what?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.484
Point of no return.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.156
We having second thoughts?

01:13.156 --> 01:16.368
Not at all. But what I'm saying is,
there are other targets.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.036
True.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.329
More easily accessible.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.414
No, Michelle.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.874
This is the target today.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.918
This is the one.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.840
There's gonna be a turn up here,
a little bit ahead.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.538
I have to confess.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.416
This is more than I could have imagined.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.501
Thank you.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.088
We've recently had
some very promising results

03:33.088 --> 03:35.007
with our gamma ray simulation techniques.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.175
It would appear so.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.136
My hat's off to you, Captain.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.637
We aim to please.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.182
You've managed to take
a pile of blurry photos,

03:43.182 --> 03:47.394
campfire stories, unreliable witnesses
and so much scientific gibberish

03:47.394 --> 03:49.479
- it might as well be Chinese algebra...
- Hey, hold on--

03:49.479 --> 03:51.273
...and used it to siphon off resources

03:51.273 --> 03:53.400
that ought to be used
to safeguard this great nation.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.402
We are trying to safeguard the world.

03:55.402 --> 03:59.114
We don't wear these uniforms
to protect the world.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.325
So you think that Godzilla
respects national boundaries?

04:01.325 --> 04:04.578
Our nuclear superiority proved
more than a match for Godzilla

04:04.578 --> 04:07.831
and I'm confident it will again,
should the need arise.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.209
Which, in the two years
since Castle Bravo,

04:10.209 --> 04:14.087
you have provided not a shred of
evidence to suggest that possibility.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.550
I have one question.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.554
Where are all these monsters?

04:25.265 --> 04:30.812
You have shoveled Uncle Sam's money into
a self-perpetuating bureaucratic sinkhole

04:30.812 --> 04:34.399
while ignoring the clear
and present threat to this country:

04:35.275 --> 04:38.529
infiltration and subversion
by hostile foreign agents.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.531
That's not exactly our department.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.324
Well, maybe it should be.

04:42.908 --> 04:47.371
I see one of your breakthroughs
is based on technology developed

04:47.371 --> 04:51.792
by a former officer
in the Imperial Japanese Navy.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.045
-"Former."
- And how Doctor Miura here ever qualified

04:55.045 --> 04:56.755
for top secret clearance is beyond me.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.257
Hey, you're out of line, Hatch.

04:58.257 --> 05:02.594
Especially given the juicy tidbits
the FBI turned up in her background check.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.846
You son of a bitch.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.018
Welcome to Monarch.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.734
Sorry.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.237
This is what our grandparents built?

05:22.614 --> 05:26.326
Well, yeah. They keep saying we're
gonna move into a bigger space

05:26.326 --> 05:28.287
but I'll believe it when I see it.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.371
Come on, we're late.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.165
I don't see any Randas up here.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.418
I thought we were Monarch royalty.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.338
Well, your family has
kind of a complicated legacy here.

05:39.131 --> 05:43.385
After your grandmother died,
your grandfather became obsessed.

05:43.385 --> 05:47.931
Started pushing all these theories
about teleportation and wormholes.

05:47.931 --> 05:51.059
Real tinfoil hat type of stuff.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.271
Is that why we're here,
to get fitted for our tinfoil hats?

05:55.397 --> 05:57.065
Let your freak flag fly, bro.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.742
This is your legacy.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.827
This is more like it.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.707
Monarch has outposts all over the world.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.212
Right now, they are picking up gamma ray
bursts just like we saw before G-Day.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.422
Alaska, North Africa,

06:20.422 --> 06:22.591
places we know your father has been.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.845
So what? Is he causing it?
Is that what you're saying?

06:26.845 --> 06:27.971
No, I'm not.

06:27.971 --> 06:31.308
But these are all points on
the map that you saw in his office.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.977
Is he predicting them
or is he following them?

06:34.478 --> 06:35.562
Good questions.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.857
We do questions really well around here.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.818
But what we need right now
are some answers.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.364
Shaw and his people
just detonated a large explosion

06:45.364 --> 06:47.616
near the site we picked you up at
in Alaska.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.911
The gamma ray emissions coming
from that area dropped to zero.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.870
Well, that sounds good.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.956
But then immediately
increased at a dozen other sites.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.290
That sounds bad.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.002
Right now, they're hovering
at levels just below what we saw on G-Day.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.131
We don't know exactly what
Shaw is trying to accomplish here.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.884
But if he sets off another blast,
it could push it over the line.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.553
So that means another G-Day?

07:08.053 --> 07:10.848
I'd rather not find out.
That's why you're here.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.101
What can we do?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.271
We know that Colonel Shaw
wanted your father's map

07:17.271 --> 07:20.732
because he's following
some pattern that Hiroshi laid out.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.442
We need to know where
Shaw's heading to next

07:22.442 --> 07:24.278
so we can stop him before it's too late.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.698
Sorry. He dumped us in the desert,

07:27.698 --> 07:30.742
stole the map
and took off with your partner.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.036
I'm not sure how much we can help.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.456
You saw Hiroshi's map.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.709
It led you to Africa.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.669
It led you to Godzilla.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.671
Tim seems to think that your bloodline

07:42.671 --> 07:45.090
gives you some unique insight
into this situation.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.010
Like, I don't see how,
but I am running out of options.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.470
So I need you to think about your father,

07:51.305 --> 07:55.976
about this map that he made
and about where it's leading Shaw.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.991
Well, I love what
they've done to the place.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.119
They don't want anyone getting in.

08:15.704 --> 08:20.250
No, I think this is their feeble attempt
to prevent anything from getting out.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.631
What exactly do you think
we'll find in there?

08:30.052 --> 08:31.470
Reach! Kei!

08:33.847 --> 08:36.350
It won't be for the faint of heart.
I can tell you that.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.317
I founded this place

08:45.317 --> 08:48.779
and that fascist tin-pot thinks
he can bury me in the basement.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.113
Well, it was everything I could do

08:50.113 --> 08:52.199
to keep you from getting thrown out
onto the street. So--

08:52.199 --> 08:54.034
And I can't believe
that crap he said about you.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.118
Juicy tidbits?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.579
What a load of racist horseshit.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.752
- How's your hand feel?
- Not great.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.295
Well, you did me a favor.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.382
If I'd gone at him like that,
I'd be in the stockade right now.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.466
You're welcome.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.428
He's gonna write a report that makes us
look like con artists.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.305
Yeah. Yeah.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.016
You know General Puckett.
Can't you do something?

09:18.684 --> 09:20.394
Well, he wants to know
where the monsters are.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.396
So the obvious solution
is to find him one.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.939
Easier said than done.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.442
- Godzilla saved our asses last time--
- No.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.779
If we tell them that the biggest H-bomb
we've ever tested didn't kill it--

09:30.779 --> 09:33.532
- They'll build a bigger one.
- Which they're gonna do anyway, Kei.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.327
Didn't you hear Hatch? I mean,
the Reds are the problem now.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.372
We made a pact.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.958
We only share what they need to know.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.543
You don't think this qualifies?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.193
I need you guys to start making a map.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.236
A map?

10:11.236 --> 10:14.615
He wants to know where the Titans are
hiding, let's draw him a goddamn map.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.951
Build me a case for Monarch.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.954
All those field notes and the journals
and the diaries that you've been keeping.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.207
You know, everything that
you've scribbled down

10:23.207 --> 10:25.250
since the Lawton sank out
from underneath you.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.045
What we know about the Titans.
Where they sleep.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.505
What they eat. Spawn. Mate.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.714
The whole shooting match.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.008
Right. We don't actually know any of that.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.677
How can I convince Puckett
this place should exist

10:35.677 --> 10:37.221
if we don't know why it should?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.891
You have three days
before the budgetary meeting.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.228
You have three days.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.815
Take your life's work
and string something together.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.364
Going a little stir-crazy in here or...

10:55.364 --> 10:57.574
I inherited that from
someone with a temper.

10:58.075 --> 11:02.829
I keep filling out a maintenance request.
But welcome to government work.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.001
What is the point of this?

11:08.001 --> 11:11.588
Travel vouchers,
requisition for office supplies--

11:11.588 --> 11:13.382
Here's an invoice for an exterminator.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.133
Did you ever throw anything away?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.177
No. And thank God I didn't.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.556
There is a connection here.

11:21.682 --> 11:25.519
A direct line from the foundation
that your grandparents laid

11:25.519 --> 11:28.438
through your father's map
straight to the readings

11:28.438 --> 11:30.357
that we're getting now. Just--

11:32.693 --> 11:33.777
We just got to find it.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.779
"July 7th, 2008."

11:35.779 --> 11:37.114
Does that mean anything?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.492
It was my 18th birthday.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.871
And my dad was here
doing the software update

11:43.871 --> 11:47.875
on the Geosynchronous
Titan Anomaly Sensing System.

11:47.875 --> 11:52.838
G-TASS. Yeah, that was tough.
That was a busy day.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.599
I'm sorry that Hiroshi
was not Dad of the Year,

12:03.599 --> 12:05.184
but this is not the time for that.

12:05.184 --> 12:08.687
Verdugo and her team,
they are up there collecting data

12:08.687 --> 12:12.524
and crunching numbers with every source
that we have. But Shaw...

12:14.109 --> 12:15.110
he's old school.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.404
- The oldest of schools.
- Exactly.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.532
He would not let this go.
This was his mission.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.950
It was his life.

12:21.950 --> 12:26.663
We're not gonna find him with
some multi-spectrum satellite sweep.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.748
Wait.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.625
Did you find something?

12:32.336 --> 12:35.506
"Operative lost during field assignment
in performance of duties.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.257
Missing presumed killed.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.219
Randa, Keiko."

12:43.639 --> 12:48.268
So Monarch cost us our father
and both our grandparents.

12:56.151 --> 13:01.448
"I request her death benefits be issued
to her surviving spouse, Randa, William.

13:02.157 --> 13:07.162
Signed, Leland L. Shaw,
Major, United States Army."

13:09.164 --> 13:10.249
Where did she die?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.008
Kazakhstan.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.553
It was on Hiroshi's map.

13:22.553 --> 13:26.056
It is one of the places we're seeing
a spike in gamma ray emissions.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.559
- Yes, one of.
- It's where he lost her.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.603
Does Shaw seem like
the sentimental type to you?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.771
Yes, he does.

13:32.771 --> 13:36.358
I mean, when we were in the desert,
the way he talked about our grandmother,

13:36.942 --> 13:39.444
I thought he was gonna tell me
he was our grandfather.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.198
Shaw is trying to rewrite the past.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.825
To do that, he needs to go back to

13:44.825 --> 13:46.785
the place where
everything went to hell for him.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.038
We're not allowed to
operate inside those borders.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.002
It'll have to be a small team.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.630
- We'll go.
- We will?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.550
I am not sending a bunch of
untrained amateurs after Lee Shaw.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.052
You sent a bunch of trained professionals
last time.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.387
How did that work out for you?

14:05.387 --> 14:09.850
Shaw practically begged us to go with him.
He wanted us to finish this together.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.230
I'll go with them.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.530
Sure. Why not?

14:24.281 --> 14:26.450
I always thought Goonies
deserved a sequel.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.084
I didn't mean to volunteer you back there.

14:36.627 --> 14:37.628
You did.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.965
Sorry, but we have to do something.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.593
Why do we have to do something?

14:45.719 --> 14:48.222
Our father worked for these people.
He made that map.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.015
And we took it to Shaw.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.350
If it hadn't been for us,

14:51.350 --> 14:56.563
Uncle Lee would still be in his
old folks' home playing boccie with Stan.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.485
Look, I get what you mean.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.655
I mean, that was me, right?
Screw Dad. He screwed us.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.741
I understand if you need to leave.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.867
I'm not leaving.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.328
But I'm not cleaning up his mess.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.829
I'm not doing this for him.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.749
Should we hold it?

15:17.209 --> 15:18.210
Okay?

15:18.710 --> 15:19.711
Okay.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.255
Coming.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.559
Hatch almost busted me
but I managed to get all the f--

15:33.559 --> 15:35.894
- Good.
- Files. What the--

15:36.645 --> 15:40.440
It's not the best work light
but the place needed something.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.651
- It did. I like it.
- Good.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.362
What's this?

15:45.362 --> 15:48.490
So I was going through your field notes

15:48.490 --> 15:51.285
and there's too much unsubstantiated data.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.788
There is second, third,
fourth hand accounts

15:54.788 --> 15:58.250
- with no corroborating evidence.
- You sound like Hatch.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.877
Would you like to lose the other hand?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.712
No. Okay.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.298
So, Lee said that we need to draw a map

16:04.298 --> 16:07.092
that clearly charts our mission
for Hatch and Puckett, right?

16:07.092 --> 16:08.677
Yeah, so? That's what I did.

16:08.677 --> 16:09.636
No.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.971
This is more like a blueprint

16:10.971 --> 16:13.599
of a house that's designed by
a hundred different architects.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.518
Ninety-nine of whom might be insane.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.228
You got stairways going nowhere,

16:18.228 --> 16:20.439
rooms with no doors,
and you end up with a house

16:20.439 --> 16:22.941
that's bigger on the inside,
but on the outside--

16:23.525 --> 16:25.736
And can you please
clean up after yourself?

16:25.736 --> 16:26.820
Yeah.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.656
How did you manage to
get ants four stories underground?

16:29.656 --> 16:35.162
We can't just exclude anything that seems
crazy when the whole damn thing is crazy.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.206
Remember...

16:39.333 --> 16:41.710
- Beyond logic lies the truth.
- Lies the truth.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.629
Yes, it's catchy.

16:43.629 --> 16:44.713
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:44.713 --> 16:48.091
But Hatch and Puckett
can't see the possibilities

16:48.091 --> 16:49.551
in the impossible the way you do.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.636
The way we do.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.026
Billy, I'm--

17:09.695 --> 17:10.571
Thank you...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.826
for what you did up there, defending me.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.244
It was stupid.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.329
But thank you.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.959
Look, the nerve of
that guy coming at you like that.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.502
Yeah. But what Hatch said, it wasn't--

17:26.547 --> 17:28.966
The truth is, there are things in my life,

17:29.925 --> 17:31.802
in my past,
that I haven't shared with you.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.512
I don't care.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.183
From the day that I met you,

17:38.851 --> 17:42.312
when you wouldn't leave me
on the wreck of the Lawton, I knew.

17:45.649 --> 17:46.859
I knew that I--

17:51.488 --> 17:52.489
I knew I--

17:55.909 --> 17:56.910
That I...

17:59.329 --> 18:00.330
could trust you...

18:02.249 --> 18:03.250
no matter what.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.510
So...

18:15.888 --> 18:22.352
So I guess the job here is to
make it simple enough to understand

18:22.352 --> 18:25.439
so that even
a Neanderthal could understand it.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.274
- Yes.
- Right.

18:27.274 --> 18:31.945
So we eliminate
what we don't have direct evidence of.

18:31.945 --> 18:32.946
Right.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.074
So we know that Godzilla was in Bikini

18:36.658 --> 18:38.327
and Hateruma.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.287
- Yeah.
- Confirmed sightings.

18:40.287 --> 18:44.166
Right. And then the--
the Lawton dragon is here off Hawaii.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.919
- And here in the Philippines.
- Yeah.

18:46.919 --> 18:50.547
And we can eliminate the Siberian reports.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.383
Excuse me?
I had three independent sources.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.552
Two drunk, one blind.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.181
- Next.
- Okay. Yucatán.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.141
Blurry photos.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.226
But photos.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.397
Okay. Mark them possible but unconfirmed.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.482
That is...

19:09.316 --> 19:10.609
- This is how it's done.
- ...not okay.

19:10.609 --> 19:12.236
- No. Okay.
- It's science.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.030
Wow, color coded and everything.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.908
So we can take it out later if we need to,
you know?

19:17.908 --> 19:19.451
Yeah. I don't know.

19:27.376 --> 19:29.586
My team will go in first,
assess the situation.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.880
We'll bring you in
once we feel the area is secure.

19:33.048 --> 19:33.966
Body armor?

19:34.758 --> 19:36.176
This isn't gonna work.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.678
This needs to go by the numbers.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.137
We don't know
what we're gonna find in there.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.139
We're gonna find Shaw, okay?

19:41.682 --> 19:44.393
And if the first thing he sees
is your team pointing guns at him,

19:44.393 --> 19:46.144
this isn't gonna turn out the way we want.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.316
You said you weren't the bad guys.

19:51.316 --> 19:54.611
That you're just a bunch of
monster nerds trying to save the world.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.406
I don't think I ever used the words
"monster nerds."

19:58.156 --> 19:59.157
I definitely did.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.450
Shaw escalated this.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.619
Yeah, and he's gonna do it again
if he sees you.

20:03.704 --> 20:04.830
He'll at least talk to us.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.540
What makes you think he'll listen?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.710
Because he wants us here.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.422
He wants someone
to take over the family business

20:13.422 --> 20:15.716
and he thinks we're
the only family he has left.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.177
He's not gonna shoot us.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.433
Okay, well, I'm not gonna be the only one.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.583
Looks like you were right.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.084
He's already here.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.176
Over there.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.151
Looks like they blasted their way in.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.672
Y'all sure you want to do this?

21:38.382 --> 21:39.550
Guess so.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.349
What kind of exposure are we looking at?

22:31.018 --> 22:32.561
About two-tenths of a millisievert.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.438
Is that bad?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.649
Bad adjacent.

22:38.150 --> 22:42.571
It's not much more than a chest X-ray,
per hour.

22:44.281 --> 22:47.659
After the meltdown, this place

22:48.952 --> 22:54.082
was supposed to be
uninhabitable for a thousand years.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.755
Something's absorbing the radiation.

23:01.215 --> 23:02.216
Something?

23:04.593 --> 23:07.012
Yeah. Well--

23:08.639 --> 23:09.640
You know.

23:14.478 --> 23:15.771
Yeah.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.413
- What the--
- Don't move.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.790
What is it?

23:34.790 --> 23:36.917
I'm not moving. Just tell me what it--

23:39.753 --> 23:42.256
No, no, that's-- It's a shell.

23:42.256 --> 23:43.507
- What?
- Yeah, it's empty.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.967
- You're fine.
- What?

23:47.094 --> 23:48.136
They all are.

23:51.348 --> 23:52.808
It's an exoskeleton.

23:53.851 --> 23:55.269
Like when an insect molts.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.355
Oh, my God.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.899
God. Jesus.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.152
You are the Monarch guy, right?

24:05.571 --> 24:06.572
Shut up.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.701
You do know why some animals molt, right?

24:11.326 --> 24:13.078
Yeah, they grew out of their skin.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.207
Fantastic.

24:33.182 --> 24:36.685
This should lead to the reactor,
or what's left of it.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.397
We're at six millisieverts now.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.400
This is where they lost Keiko.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.527
Then this is where he'll be.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.205
Fan out. Stay alert.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.416
Holy--

25:25.943 --> 25:27.402
You think they had a meltdown?

25:29.238 --> 25:30.531
It's a portal.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.741
It's an entry point.

25:33.659 --> 25:34.785
To where?

25:36.703 --> 25:38.205
Tinfoil hat land.

25:42.793 --> 25:44.586
Is Shaw's plan really that crazy?

25:46.380 --> 25:47.589
To try and close it?

25:49.258 --> 25:50.425
Tim.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.356
Charges. Set all around the perimeter.

26:05.107 --> 26:07.651
Looks like enough to bring
this whole place down on top of us.

26:09.361 --> 26:10.612
Can you defuse them?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.155
I can try.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.492
Looks like they're rigged
to a radio detonator.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.579
Step away from that.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.455
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:21.373 --> 26:22.416
And put your gun down.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.375
Do it.

26:24.543 --> 26:27.754
Shouldn't be here, Tim.
You're not cut out for fieldwork.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.757
You sure about that?
Maybe I learned a thing or two from you.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.677
Look around, sweetie pie.
Clearly not enough.

26:35.304 --> 26:37.598
- I said gun down.
- Okay, okay.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.183
Hey, just--

26:39.183 --> 26:40.726
Okay. Okay.

26:45.856 --> 26:46.940
Hey.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.359
Are you gonna shoot me, Michelle?

26:49.359 --> 26:51.778
I don't want to, Timothy,
so don't make me.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.031
We can't let you stop this.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.366
Everyone stop.

27:01.163 --> 27:04.750
No one is shooting anyone.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.837
Where is Shaw?

27:10.881 --> 27:14.009
Well, you finally made it.

27:15.385 --> 27:19.806
I assume this means you wanna talk.

27:25.187 --> 27:26.188
Let's talk.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.819
Cate. Just you.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.547
Stairs to nowhere.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.467
Rooms without doors.

28:00.848 --> 28:02.432
What the hell are we missing?

28:18.532 --> 28:19.741
Bigger on the inside.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.370
Keiko!

28:25.414 --> 28:26.415
Keiko!

28:28.333 --> 28:29.751
Hey, Keiko, you in there?

28:30.961 --> 28:32.254
I'm coming around back.

28:35.632 --> 28:36.633
Keiko!

28:39.553 --> 28:40.554
It's the ants.

28:40.554 --> 28:42.931
- What are you doing here?
- The ants. I'm sorry.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.017
- I know how you are about your privacy.
- You can't be here.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.226
- Yeah. Okay.
- Billy.

28:47.561 --> 28:51.231
I tried to call but it was busy.

28:51.732 --> 28:52.816
Keep your voice down.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.067
Can you keep your--

28:54.067 --> 28:55.485
- keep your voice down.
- So--

28:55.485 --> 28:57.446
- I had it off the hook.
- Why?

28:57.446 --> 29:00.032
- Well, just...
- It doesn't matter.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.951
The ants showed me
it's bigger on the inside.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.369
What are you talking about?

29:04.369 --> 29:05.954
What if they live underground?

29:05.954 --> 29:07.289
The Titans.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.667
If that's how they move around the world
without being seen.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.629
- Like ants.
- Yes. Sort of.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.299
What if their underground
isn't just underground?

29:17.883 --> 29:22.346
What if it's another realm,
not just beneath the earth, but...

29:22.346 --> 29:23.555
Inside of it.

29:24.056 --> 29:29.186
Yes. Inside, but also alongside,

29:30.312 --> 29:33.524
existing together.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.443
Bigger on the inside.

29:38.862 --> 29:39.863
That sounds...

29:41.198 --> 29:42.282
Crazy.

29:42.783 --> 29:43.784
Yes.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.369
But brilliant.

29:47.037 --> 29:47.871
Yeah?

29:49.081 --> 29:50.541
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29:52.501 --> 29:53.544
Mama.

30:14.106 --> 30:17.067
This is my son Hiroshi.

30:21.154 --> 30:21.989
Hi.

30:32.374 --> 30:37.546
So, it's why I applied to
do my postgraduate work at Berkeley.

30:38.463 --> 30:44.219
After the war I wanted Hiroshi
to have other opportunities.

30:44.970 --> 30:48.849
And then I couldn't bring him
in the beginning,

30:50.684 --> 30:53.020
so my mother's been looking after him.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.193
I just didn't realize how long
it was gonna take for me to bring him.

31:01.945 --> 31:04.740
I was finally able
to save up enough money,

31:06.116 --> 31:07.993
thanks to the job at Monarch.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.370
Yeah.

31:10.871 --> 31:14.708
And their visas came through
about six months ago.

31:18.003 --> 31:21.089
So, he's what Hatch was talking about?

31:22.799 --> 31:24.092
Your juicy tidbit?

31:25.093 --> 31:27.596
- What did you think it was?
- Nothing.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.895
I wanted to tell you and Lee.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.647
- I really did.
- No. No, it's-- Don't.

31:36.647 --> 31:41.652
And I almost did so many times.

31:43.403 --> 31:47.199
But you see how I'm treated.

31:49.284 --> 31:52.079
A woman. A Japanese.

31:54.706 --> 31:58.544
It's hard enough
to get an ounce of respect.

32:00.671 --> 32:03.215
What do you think they'd do
if they found out I was a widow

32:03.215 --> 32:04.967
trying to raise a child alone?

32:08.303 --> 32:09.555
Then don't do it alone.

32:11.515 --> 32:14.393
You know, I got your back.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.772
We, Monarch, we got your back.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.138
Why just me?

32:51.138 --> 32:53.140
You know why.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.439
You looked into his eyes.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.152
He's not just a mindless,
destructive force.

33:05.152 --> 33:08.238
He knows what he's doing.

33:09.531 --> 33:10.866
And what's that?

33:19.583 --> 33:21.502
There's a world down there, Cate.

33:24.129 --> 33:25.631
And it's not ours.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.385
There's a world down there?

33:30.385 --> 33:35.390
Oh, yeah. I know because I've been to it.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.561
It exists, Cate.

33:41.104 --> 33:42.773
Billy and Keiko were right.

33:42.773 --> 33:43.941
Please.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.610
Please believe me.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.530
I want to believe you.

33:51.657 --> 33:54.034
Well, that puts you one up on Monarch.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.663
And your dad, too, by the way. At first.

34:06.255 --> 34:07.422
What did you see?

34:08.966 --> 34:11.635
Tell me what they couldn't believe.

34:14.638 --> 34:20.351
I'm afraid that's
just simply incomprehensible.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.897
But what I learned from it

34:25.232 --> 34:28.902
was why Keiko was trying
to tell everybody at Bikini Atoll

34:28.902 --> 34:32.822
why they were wrong
to try to destroy Godzilla.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.117
He's not here to hurt us.

34:35.117 --> 34:40.246
He's just keeping his kind in their world
and us in ours.

34:42.833 --> 34:45.252
So that's why
you wanna seal off their world.

34:45.252 --> 34:47.713
I am sealing off their world.

34:48.839 --> 34:50.257
Every portal.

34:52.634 --> 34:54.178
But what if you're making things worse?

34:54.803 --> 34:57.431
We went to Monarch,
and we saw the gamma ray readings.

34:57.431 --> 34:59.349
The same type they were
getting right before G-Day.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.767
Come on, Cate.

35:01.393 --> 35:05.063
Monarch can cherry-pick
any piece of data they want

35:05.063 --> 35:08.233
to justify
continually sitting on their hands,

35:08.233 --> 35:09.443
which is what they do.

35:09.443 --> 35:13.155
They study their data
and then they study it again.

35:13.697 --> 35:18.118
What makes you so sure that your data,
whatever that might be, is so right?

35:18.118 --> 35:20.662
It's not about the data, Cate.

35:20.662 --> 35:23.749
It's all about belief.

35:26.627 --> 35:29.004
And to some small degree atonement.

35:44.353 --> 35:46.522
A nun and a priest are walking along.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.315
Now, they get into a sandstorm.

35:48.899 --> 35:49.983
General.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.736
- General.
- No idea--

35:52.736 --> 35:54.363
A moment of your time, sir?

35:56.823 --> 35:58.909
Well, you had your moment, son.
It passed you by.

36:00.494 --> 36:03.539
I'm due before the vice president
in about two minutes and sadly--

36:03.539 --> 36:05.040
Give us a minute.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.545
Sadly, there's nothing
in Lieutenant Hatch's illuminating report

36:09.545 --> 36:12.214
to justify the continued funding
of Project Monarch.

36:13.507 --> 36:16.927
I am disappointed in you, Leland.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.305
I understand, sir.

36:20.305 --> 36:22.182
That's why I wanted to give you this

36:23.308 --> 36:25.811
as a token of my appreciation
for all that you've done for me.

36:26.728 --> 36:27.729
And what's this?

36:27.729 --> 36:28.939
It's a map, sir.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.107
A map?

36:30.107 --> 36:33.235
A comprehensive projection
of all the potential Titan threats

36:33.235 --> 36:35.404
currently under assessment
by Project Monarch.

36:35.404 --> 36:37.573
Jesus Christ, you do not give up.

36:37.573 --> 36:40.200
Well, thank you for your generous offer,

36:40.200 --> 36:43.245
but Lieutenant Hatch has given me
all the information that I need.

36:43.245 --> 36:45.873
Sir, I believe that you'll find
Lieutenant Hatch's report

36:45.873 --> 36:50.711
has omitted certain facts
to justify shifting funding

36:50.711 --> 36:52.796
from Monarch to his own priorities.

36:52.796 --> 36:55.007
Facts? Such as?

36:59.261 --> 37:00.888
Such as Godzilla, sir.

37:01.430 --> 37:02.639
Well, it's highly classified.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.099
Why would he have that in his file?

37:06.143 --> 37:07.394
We didn't kill it.

37:21.158 --> 37:22.284
What did you say?

37:22.284 --> 37:24.578
It was sighted during the operation
at Hateruma Island, sir.

37:24.578 --> 37:26.246
This is confirmed?

37:26.246 --> 37:27.748
Sighted by me, sir.

37:33.337 --> 37:34.588
It's all in here.

37:37.341 --> 37:38.383
You playing games with me?

37:38.383 --> 37:39.676
No. No, sir.

37:39.676 --> 37:43.722
I just feel compelled to point out that
this was not provided by Lieutenant Hatch,

37:43.722 --> 37:45.474
but through the sole dedication,

37:45.474 --> 37:49.520
diligence and loyalty
of doctors Miura and Randa.

37:50.229 --> 37:51.230
Noted.

37:53.357 --> 37:55.901
I do hope that doctors Miura
and Randa's position

37:55.901 --> 37:59.321
as sole authority over Project Monarch's
scientific operations

37:59.321 --> 38:00.572
will remain unchallenged.

38:04.034 --> 38:05.327
Why wouldn't they?

38:07.746 --> 38:08.997
Sir.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.501
He is ready for you, General.

38:16.505 --> 38:17.631
Good luck, sir.

38:22.761 --> 38:23.762
You too.

38:30.352 --> 38:31.979
He's lost it, Michelle.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.439
Shaw. He doesn't know what he's doing.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.525
He knows exactly what he's doing.

38:37.776 --> 38:42.281
And at least he's not sitting around, Tim,
waiting to see what happens next.

38:42.281 --> 38:44.283
Whose city will be destroyed?

38:44.783 --> 38:48.954
- Whose family will die?
- This could destroy everything.

38:48.954 --> 38:51.123
This could destroy the whole world.

38:51.123 --> 38:53.292
Or it could save us.

38:56.503 --> 38:58.714
Do you think this is
what she would have wanted?

39:00.465 --> 39:01.508
Keiko?

39:01.508 --> 39:06.763
She was the first one to jump in,
against my better judgment.

39:09.141 --> 39:10.976
My mission was to protect her.

39:12.394 --> 39:13.645
My job.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.030
I know this is where you lost her.

39:24.239 --> 39:25.699
I read the file.

39:29.036 --> 39:31.163
Sounds like she was a force of nature.

39:34.541 --> 39:35.834
And then some.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.840
Talk all you want about stopping monsters
and saving the world.

39:43.425 --> 39:45.260
This is to make up for losing her,
isn't it?

39:47.179 --> 39:48.764
Well, of course it is.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.809
But that's not really possible now, is it?

39:55.395 --> 39:59.566
But I can still honor the work
that Billy and Keiko were trying to do.

40:00.150 --> 40:03.570
- I understand what you're saying, but--
- No time for indecision, Cate.

40:04.071 --> 40:08.575
Especially when you've already seen
what indecision can cost you.

40:10.244 --> 40:12.162
- Clear the space.
- Copy that.

40:13.163 --> 40:14.164
Let's go.

40:15.832 --> 40:16.875
Come on.

40:19.378 --> 40:20.796
- The hell was that?
- Something's coming.

40:23.507 --> 40:25.217
Oh, shit.

40:25.217 --> 40:28.428
- Get out! Everybody out!
- Cate!

40:28.428 --> 40:30.222
- May, get back!
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:32.224 --> 40:34.184
- May!
- Hang on!

40:35.936 --> 40:37.020
No, no, no!

40:37.688 --> 40:38.689
May!

40:59.376 --> 41:00.210
I got you!

41:01.670 --> 41:02.838
Don't let go of me!

41:04.298 --> 41:05.507
Cate!
