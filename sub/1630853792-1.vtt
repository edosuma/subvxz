00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
A NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:42.708 --> 00:47.166
That's Samanta Sosa, the junkie
who was a regular at the precinct.

00:47.666 --> 00:51.500
A spark started the fire.
She was asleep and couldn't react.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.708
Looks like she was drunk.

00:56.416 --> 00:59.166
Paredes found her a couple hours ago.

00:59.666 --> 01:01.375
He's still scared shitless.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.750
That Sami was a good-looking girl.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.458
It's a shame, man.
We always lose the best.

01:35.958 --> 01:39.125
A FEW HOURS BEFORE

02:18.708 --> 02:20.583
-How'd it go?
-Fine.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.250
I'll go give Manchado a bath
and some water. He's beat.

02:24.750 --> 02:25.583
Okay.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.375
Come on, Manchado.

02:37.666 --> 02:41.208
Do you want to see
the masks your kids ordered for tonight?

02:41.291 --> 02:42.875
No, it's their party.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.625
I'll check the girls
and try to catch the game.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.875
The black apron is fine.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.291
No makeup.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.250
Or accessories.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.833
Luis is here.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.708
Aren't you running late, ma'am?

03:10.791 --> 03:11.750
Even better.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.833
Rómulo can wait for me.

03:15.958 --> 03:17.125
How are you, Luis?

03:53.583 --> 03:54.666
Oh, honey.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.250
Careful. It's really crowded. Stay close.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.083
We're near Toto's mom's stand.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.375
Fine, go. Be careful.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.791
If I didn't know you,
I'd say you're still into him.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.375
But you do know me.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.583
Right. Just saying.

04:27.708 --> 04:30.583
After two years, you can say hi.
He won't bite.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.125
Auntie, no.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.708
It'd be good for you to go out.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.250
I'm here.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.125
I don't mean once a year.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.333
Paco, you came!

05:33.375 --> 05:34.500
I'm here with you.

05:40.916 --> 05:43.000
I didn't know you were back.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.750
I thought Paco would stay in Madrid.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.125
Apparently not.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.458
Just accept it already.
Your brother calls him.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.291
What's more annoying?

06:01.958 --> 06:04.083
To be forgotten or unnoticed by him?

06:13.958 --> 06:16.916
Sami, what are you doing?
Estela is right there.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.833
Take that stuff to the kitchen.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.625
Do I know you?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.250
Nahuel Mamani!

08:33.750 --> 08:36.041
You're under arrest for robbery!

08:36.541 --> 08:38.333
-Stop.
-Don't take him, please!

08:38.416 --> 08:41.083
-Come on. Get up.
-Stop. Let her go.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.083
Easy.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.000
Shut your mouth.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.583
-Easy.
-Let her go!

08:49.083 --> 08:50.333
Easy, I said!

08:50.416 --> 08:51.708
Easy!

08:54.250 --> 08:55.875
-Please! No!
-Get off her, Pérez.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.625
-Who's there?
-Evening, ma'am.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.416
I'm Luis Paredes, Juan's dad.
Sorry for the scare.

10:15.000 --> 10:15.916
Your son knows me.

10:16.791 --> 10:17.708
Is something up?

10:18.208 --> 10:21.250
I'm on the cougar's trail
and wanted to keep on it.

10:22.291 --> 10:24.500
I saw it two hours ago on the road.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.750
-Can I go across here?
-Sure.

10:26.833 --> 10:30.666
Listen, Ms. Manuela,
keep your door shut tight.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.750
That animal is fierce.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.166
Especially since you're on your own.

10:35.833 --> 10:36.666
Thank you.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.125
Mom?

11:42.250 --> 11:43.083
What's up?

11:45.458 --> 11:46.291
It's nothing.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.083
I just couldn't sleep.

12:24.416 --> 12:27.250
<i>Manuela, Sami was found dead.</i>

12:27.750 --> 12:29.541
I can't hear you. Hi.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.791
<i>Samanta Sosa.</i>

12:31.291 --> 12:35.083
<i>She was found dead</i>
<i>at the Pico del Águila shelter.</i>

12:35.583 --> 12:37.583
PRECINCT 57
LA QUEBRADA

12:39.250 --> 12:41.875
Could she have stopped by
while we were at the party?

12:41.958 --> 12:43.625
Is anything missing?

12:44.125 --> 12:48.000
No. I was in the shed.
Why ask if something's missing?

12:48.083 --> 12:51.000
Earlier she stole an expensive necklace
from her employer.

12:51.083 --> 12:54.750
-Where was she working?
-At the Carreras's party.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.041
Thanks for coming in.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.791
That's fine.
I came here as soon as I heard.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.958
-Hi there!
-I want to see Nahuel Mamani.

13:04.041 --> 13:07.791
You got lonely up in the sticks
and came looking for a real man?

13:08.625 --> 13:09.500
You little…

13:09.583 --> 13:11.291
How can we help, Luna?

13:12.541 --> 13:15.166
-Pérez, finish that report.
-Yes, sir.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.875
-Have you seen him?
-Not yet.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.166
Let me in, Rufino. I want to see him.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.166
He's in solitary. I can't.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.333
He was beaten up.

13:24.416 --> 13:25.458
He's hurt.

13:25.541 --> 13:27.833
It's out of my hands. He resisted arrest.

13:27.916 --> 13:30.416
I need to talk to him. Help me, please.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.583
I'll tell him anything you want
on your behalf.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.083
CAUSE OF DEATH:
FIRE/ACCIDENT

13:35.166 --> 13:36.166
That's all I can do.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.166
-You can believe me.
-Go on.

13:38.666 --> 13:39.666
Let him through.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.458
-My pleasure.
-See you.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.291
INCOMING CALL
ALICIA

14:00.208 --> 14:02.916
Tell my niece

14:03.791 --> 14:04.708
what you told me.

14:04.791 --> 14:07.375
Who ordered you to clean all this up?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.083
The town council.

14:09.166 --> 14:13.041
They will build a post
so people can be safe.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.291
Did you know the woman who died?

14:18.166 --> 14:19.500
Yes, Sami.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.791
She came often.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.375
Here and the north chapel.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.625
Sami wasn't religious.

15:10.750 --> 15:15.291
She stole a necklace from the Carrerases,
slept at the post, and had the accident.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.666
Why did she go by your house?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.333
She took a shortcut.

15:19.416 --> 15:21.625
My place is on the way from the ranch.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.666
Why not my place?

15:24.166 --> 15:27.041
She was by herself.
And she didn't always drop by.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.583
She was making an effort.

15:29.666 --> 15:33.791
We know how these cases go.
How many relapses for every recovery?

15:34.416 --> 15:35.750
What are you implying?

15:38.583 --> 15:42.166
That her addiction killed her
and she had it coming?

15:45.250 --> 15:46.416
I didn't say that.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.375
I said it looks like an accident.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.125
I got the report.

15:54.958 --> 15:57.958
When the autopsy report is ready,
I'll close it.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.250
I'll get statements
from the Carreras's staff.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.250
You won't need to.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.958
García talked to the help.

16:05.541 --> 16:08.541
And brought the girl's belongings
from the house.

16:08.625 --> 16:09.583
Ask him.

16:11.791 --> 16:15.625
I got Manuela Pelari's statement.
She's Alicia's niece.

16:16.791 --> 16:19.541
She was the last one
to see Samanta Sosa alive.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.708
What should I do
with Ms. Carreras's necklace?

16:28.875 --> 16:30.333
Leave it with me.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.041
I'll get it to her.

16:33.416 --> 16:36.708
What the police say isn't good enough.
They don't care.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.750
Yesterday I was with her. Now she's dead.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.583
I need your help.

16:51.583 --> 16:55.125
If she had a relapse or an accident,
I want to know for sure.

16:55.208 --> 16:58.125
I'll accept it,
but only if you can confirm it.

16:59.291 --> 17:02.291
It's the least I can do
to lay her to rest.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.375
<i>I am as sad and surprised</i>

17:05.458 --> 17:08.416
<i>as the rest of you</i>
<i>by what happened recently.</i>

17:08.500 --> 17:10.083
<i>Our town is mourning.</i>

17:10.166 --> 17:11.250
CANDIDATE

17:11.333 --> 17:14.000
<i>An innocent girl's disappearance</i>
<i>is a tragic incident</i>

17:14.083 --> 17:17.958
<i>that makes us reflect</i>
<i>on the precarious state of the facilities</i>

17:18.041 --> 17:20.333
<i>that the town council is liable for.</i>

17:20.916 --> 17:24.875
<i>What amazes me the most</i>
<i>is the Mamani family's report.</i>

17:25.500 --> 17:27.083
<i>Was it an unlawful arrest?</i>

17:28.041 --> 17:29.333
<i>We don't know.</i>

17:33.708 --> 17:35.541
What's your fucking job, Mellino?

17:36.166 --> 17:37.083
Tell me.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.875
A Qulla leader ended up beaten.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.208
A girl scorched to death.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.375
All in less than four hours.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.041
Nahuel's arrest
should have been clean-cut,

17:48.125 --> 17:49.583
a model arrest.

17:50.125 --> 17:53.416
And instead, the family
is claiming police brutality.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.125
And the Qulla girl?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.000
What's your excuse with her?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.250
Why won't you listen, Rómulo?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.208
Mamani resisted arrest.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.333
What happened to that girl
was an accident.

18:05.833 --> 18:09.208
A god-awful coincidence,
but an accident all the same.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.416
I don't give a fuck about the Qulla.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.708
But I want to lay it out for you.

18:19.791 --> 18:22.083
We are four days away from elections.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.208
Torres is lashing out in the media.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.916
The mining company is pressuring me.
Plus, Etelvina.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.708
The Americans' deal feeds us all.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.750
Keep your end of the bargain.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.875
I know fully what my duty is.

18:38.416 --> 18:39.500
Just had bad luck.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.041
Nahuel is locked up. He's no trouble.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.875
Get Mamani a doctor,
food, clothes, whatever.

18:46.958 --> 18:47.791
On it.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.958
-They can't see him all beaten up.
-Okay.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.791
Don't make me
do something I don't want to do.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.291
Let's keep things civil.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.041
You get it.

19:26.583 --> 19:30.291
LA QUEBRADA POLICE DEPARTMENT
NAME: SAMANTA SOSA

19:33.208 --> 19:34.041
Hello?

19:35.875 --> 19:36.708
Hello?

19:40.833 --> 19:47.750
CELL PHONE
TRACING AND TRACKING REQUEST

19:52.041 --> 19:54.083
NUMBER 387 4638896

19:57.208 --> 20:00.583
My niece Manuela
needs to ask you some questions.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.500
Go ahead.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.916
It's about Samanta Sosa.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.166
Did you know her?

20:06.666 --> 20:09.208
It's important for me that you answer.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.541
No… but I knew who she was.

20:13.625 --> 20:17.500
When they hold events at the house,
we hire people. Extra staff.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.833
María recommended her.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.583
María is trustworthy.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.208
I saw it as reason enough to hire her.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.958
Alicia, I know
how much you help these girls.

20:28.041 --> 20:32.083
And I know everything you do,
but not all of the girls are good.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.541
Why do you say that?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.625
Like I told the officer,

20:36.250 --> 20:38.625
she ran off when I caught her stealing.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.833
It surprised me to see
Ms. Mecha's necklace on her.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.541
And what happened then?

20:43.625 --> 20:45.958
I told her to put it back immediately.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.958
But she was very upset.

20:48.041 --> 20:51.333
She said it wasn't her
and she didn't steal anything.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.541
-Did you see her again after that?
-No.

20:54.625 --> 20:57.916
I looked for her,
but that's when she must have fled.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.000
You can ask María.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.250
They were friends.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.416
Excuse me, María Segovia's house?

21:09.416 --> 21:10.875
Right there, at the corner.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.083
Hi.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.375
Are you María, Samanta's friend?

21:16.875 --> 21:17.708
Yes.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.750
I'm Manuela, Alicia Pelari's niece.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.250
-What do you want?
-To know what happened.

21:26.291 --> 21:27.833
They say it was an accident.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.500
Yes.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.875
And she was caught stealing.

21:34.958 --> 21:36.000
Says who?

21:36.083 --> 21:36.916
Estela.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.666
She had the necklace. Why?

21:42.583 --> 21:45.208
You knew her well. Did she seem off?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.125
Off how?

21:50.625 --> 21:51.458
Drugs?

21:52.041 --> 21:55.041
Sami was clean.
That's why I got her the job.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.708
Did you know
she hid her loot at the chapel?

21:58.791 --> 22:00.458
I don't know anything.

22:06.875 --> 22:13.791
LA QUEBRADA BREAKS THE RECORD
WITH CRUZ CARRERAS

22:26.333 --> 22:28.583
Would you come with me, Captain?

22:29.083 --> 22:30.375
Thanks, Estela.

22:53.958 --> 22:55.875
I wanted to bring it myself.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.708
-I thought I'd lost it.
-I know how important it is.

23:02.750 --> 23:03.916
Did you recognize it?

23:05.083 --> 23:06.291
It was my mother's.

23:06.791 --> 23:08.333
I haven't worn it in ages.

23:09.041 --> 23:11.416
I gave it to Mechita for her wedding.

23:12.375 --> 23:15.083
And now you need to calm down, Etelvina.

23:16.875 --> 23:17.916
It's over.

23:18.416 --> 23:19.958
I'm worried about Cruz.

23:21.625 --> 23:22.458
He got worse.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.250
Do you want me to talk to him?

23:30.333 --> 23:34.916
Or if there's anything else you need.
You know you can count on me.

23:35.750 --> 23:36.583
As always.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.625
You've done enough.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.083
I don't know how to thank you.

23:47.666 --> 23:49.291
It's best if you leave now.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.250
Goodbye.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.083
Goodbye.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.916
Hey! Give me a kiss? Oh, okay.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.208
They are all there.

24:38.416 --> 24:40.208
ESTIMATED LOCATION

27:52.958 --> 27:54.708
<i>Hoodie, gloves…</i>

27:54.791 --> 27:57.833
Your description suggests
he's not just any burglar.

28:00.500 --> 28:04.125
Do you think this guy may have known you?

28:06.166 --> 28:07.750
I don't get what you mean.

28:07.833 --> 28:11.000
I mean, it may have not been
a random break-in.

28:11.958 --> 28:15.541
There are no thieves
in La Quebrada who fit that description.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.375
Perhaps they want something from you.

28:19.291 --> 28:22.500
Or someone has
a personal grievance against you.

28:24.083 --> 28:24.916
No.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.875
Is that registered?

28:34.791 --> 28:38.333
What did you do for a living
before coming to La Quebrada?

28:40.041 --> 28:42.000
I've lived here for ten years.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.583
I work in the field.

28:48.583 --> 28:51.833
Ms. Pelari, we too want to find
the man who attacked you.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.083
I was in the police.

29:00.708 --> 29:01.833
In the police?

29:03.833 --> 29:05.791
We're colleagues then.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.333
What division?

29:11.291 --> 29:12.583
Violent crimes.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.583
That's why I retired.

29:17.208 --> 29:20.708
Well, you know this makes
the situation totally different.

29:20.791 --> 29:24.416
You worked in a division
where it's easy to make enemies.

29:27.458 --> 29:31.458
Think about it, please.
Think hard. Try to remember.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.041
Someone could be after you
to settle a score.

29:41.583 --> 29:42.833
No one's after me.

29:44.625 --> 29:45.750
I'm not on the run.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.666
Of course not.

29:50.916 --> 29:52.125
I didn't say that.

29:58.958 --> 29:59.875
Okay.

30:00.541 --> 30:02.875
Any more details?

30:03.750 --> 30:05.333
No, that's it.

30:06.083 --> 30:07.375
Call me anytime.

30:07.458 --> 30:09.416
-Yes, thank you.
-All right.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.791
Let's go.

30:13.916 --> 30:18.041
CORNELIA VILLALBA CASE

30:18.125 --> 30:21.583
I thought by letting go of Cornelia,
I was paying my debt.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.541
But then it became a black hole.

30:26.916 --> 30:28.541
For you, Cornelia

30:29.666 --> 30:31.583
was a childhood friend,

30:32.750 --> 30:34.333
not a dealer.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.375
I was a cop, and I let her go.
That was a mistake.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.625
A mistake you already paid for, Manuela.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.500
Why punish yourself?

30:42.583 --> 30:43.750
What for, anyway?

30:47.333 --> 30:48.291
It was useless.

30:48.791 --> 30:50.500
That is not true.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.458
It made you become who you are now.

30:53.541 --> 30:55.833
I fight with that person every day.

30:57.083 --> 31:02.958
When you brought me here, I swore Tobías
and I would have a violence-free life.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.250
Without Pipa.

31:11.083 --> 31:14.833
What happened today
isn't connected to your past as a cop.

31:18.750 --> 31:19.583
It isn't.

31:21.416 --> 31:22.250
I know.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.416
Well, then…

31:28.500 --> 31:29.375
what's wrong?

31:29.875 --> 31:32.375
The guy checked outside first.

31:36.916 --> 31:37.875
Why there?

31:41.416 --> 31:43.416
He knew Samanta was here, so he came.

31:45.041 --> 31:47.583
In that case, it wasn't an accident.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.791
FULL NAME:
MANUELA PELARI

31:58.708 --> 32:00.916
…RECKLESS BEHAVIOR…

32:02.583 --> 32:03.750
Rufino.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.000
Luna, why come now?

32:06.083 --> 32:08.541
It's his birthday. He cried all day long.

32:09.041 --> 32:10.458
He wants to see his dad.

32:11.041 --> 32:13.125
Let us in just for a few minutes.

32:13.625 --> 32:15.583
I told you he's in solitary.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.625
I don't want problems.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.250
Let's go, baby.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.250
Okay.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.208
Luna!

32:26.500 --> 32:27.333
Play.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.083
NORTHWESTERN PATO CLUB

32:53.166 --> 32:55.625
Your brother should be here.
What happened?

32:56.375 --> 32:57.291
I don't know.

32:57.791 --> 32:59.083
He's not answering.

32:59.166 --> 33:01.041
I can't manage everything constantly.

33:01.541 --> 33:04.916
It's a key moment
for the mining company, the election…

33:05.958 --> 33:08.166
Why is that contract so important, Mom?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.833
Come on, Mechita.

33:10.333 --> 33:13.125
When will you understand
it's not a contract?

33:13.625 --> 33:16.583
It's what I've been building for 25 years.

33:18.791 --> 33:20.208
I ask for two things.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.833
Two.

33:22.583 --> 33:26.083
Focus on your engagement,
and handle your brother as usual.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.541
This time is different.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.166
Then grow up, darling.

33:31.208 --> 33:35.458
Think like a daughter of mine,
not about nonsense and parties.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.041
-Agustín.
-Etelvina.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.875
-My dear.
-How are you?

33:39.958 --> 33:41.583
Ready for tonight's toast?

33:41.666 --> 33:42.500
Yes.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.416
-I'm very happy.
-That's good.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.583
Why couldn't Cruz make it?

33:46.666 --> 33:48.833
A migraine. A last-minute thing.

33:48.916 --> 33:51.041
If you'll excuse me, I need to go.

33:51.125 --> 33:52.208
Of course.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.833
Without Cruz, this team sucks.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.375
<i>Cruz </i>sucks.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.833
Come on, honey.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.750
Don't start.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.916
You're telling me not to start? Look,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.958
I came back after five months
to announce our engagement

34:09.041 --> 34:11.875
because you and Dad asked me to.

34:11.958 --> 34:15.208
I get here, and your brother
is in the worst shape ever.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.083
He's going through a rough patch.

34:19.166 --> 34:21.500
He always is.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.708
He knows you're moving to London?

34:25.625 --> 34:27.208
I was thinking about that.

34:29.625 --> 34:31.208
Can we take him with us?

34:32.083 --> 34:37.458
You think I don't realize
how things stand, but know this.

34:39.083 --> 34:42.875
I don't want Cruz in our lives, Mecha.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.458
He's a ticking time bomb.

34:46.416 --> 34:47.708
So, think it through.

34:47.791 --> 34:50.250
Sooner or later, you'll have to choose.

34:51.666 --> 34:53.125
You can't have us both.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.125
It's him or me.

35:01.416 --> 35:02.583
It's freezing cold.

35:04.833 --> 35:07.458
After a while, you won't notice.
You'll see.

35:14.958 --> 35:17.791
-Do you regret the other day?
-Yes.

35:19.791 --> 35:20.750
Don't you?

35:22.625 --> 35:23.583
Not all of it.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.250
It was a mistake.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.000
-It shouldn't have happened.
-Will you get married?

35:34.583 --> 35:36.708
Why even ask? Of course I will.

35:36.791 --> 35:37.708
Why?

35:41.791 --> 35:45.500
-You should be clean for tomorrow's game.
-Was Dad there?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.625
Dad's dead, Cruz.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.250
Mom will cover for me. Make something up.

35:56.958 --> 35:59.750
-I don't want to go.
-Mom only thinks about herself.

35:59.833 --> 36:01.500
She's pressuring me.

36:05.541 --> 36:06.708
Poor baby sis.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.666
Stuck with the worst of us.

36:30.750 --> 36:31.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:34.041 --> 36:35.708
I got a report from school.

36:35.791 --> 36:38.916
-Something happened to Tobías?
-Not exactly, but…

36:40.541 --> 36:41.500
it's serious.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.458
<i>Again. Don't miss this time.</i>

36:57.083 --> 37:00.083
-I'll go.
-Tobías skipped school. Did you know?

37:00.166 --> 37:02.125
-What?
-I think I know where he is.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.291
Wait for me!

37:19.375 --> 37:20.958
-Yay!
-Great!

37:23.666 --> 37:25.958
-I'm going.
-No, it's my turn.

37:26.041 --> 37:26.916
Suqu, come.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.666
-I'll go.
-No, it's my turn.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.125
Take it. Be careful.

37:36.291 --> 37:37.250
Take the bullet.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.416
-Snap it.
-Suqu'll miss.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.750
Shut up, Toto.

37:44.750 --> 37:45.625
Cock it.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.791
On the sight. Aim there.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.625
You can do it, Suqu.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.750
Go, Suqu.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.958
Tobías!

38:04.416 --> 38:05.583
Why did you come?

38:09.041 --> 38:10.458
I'll find you. Go home.

38:10.541 --> 38:11.375
Hand it to me.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.291
No.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.208
Put it down.

38:14.916 --> 38:15.750
It's dangerous.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.625
Why are you doing this?

38:18.416 --> 38:20.041
Now they'll make fun of me.

38:21.208 --> 38:24.250
I don't care what your friends think.
Hand it to me.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.916
Do you think I can't?

38:31.083 --> 38:32.625
It's Juan's, not mine!

38:32.708 --> 38:35.041
-He'll be mad.
-Not more than me.

38:35.125 --> 38:37.583
-You lied to me.
-You're the liar.

38:37.666 --> 38:38.666
I hate you.

39:17.208 --> 39:19.041
Being a single parent is hard.

39:21.416 --> 39:22.416
I lied to him.

39:25.250 --> 39:26.458
It's my fault.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.708
You did it to protect him.

39:33.541 --> 39:34.875
Thanks.

39:40.541 --> 39:42.041
How did you find him?

39:45.875 --> 39:49.833
By accident while tracking
Samanta Sosa's lost cell phone.

39:49.916 --> 39:51.500
Sami's cell phone is lost?

39:51.583 --> 39:53.833
The antennas didn't find the exact spot.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.375
They showed a broad area.

39:56.458 --> 39:57.583
I couldn't find it.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.375
The Carrerases live five kilometers away.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.000
If the phone is on, someone has it.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.583
It hasn't been on since.

40:09.416 --> 40:12.708
It may have run out of battery
or could be lost in the valley.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.583
She could've lost it before the party.
It's not conclusive.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.250
You still think it was an accident?

40:21.875 --> 40:22.958
There's no proof.

40:24.250 --> 40:27.625
No sign that would justify
opening a murder investigation.

40:28.166 --> 40:30.166
You were a cop. You should know.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.541
Maybe she didn't steal.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.958
She had the necklace. Witnesses saw.

40:37.041 --> 40:38.750
Did the guests give statements?

40:39.250 --> 40:40.875
Were the Carrerases questioned?

40:41.375 --> 40:43.541
There's no need to question anyone.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.458
Much less the Carrerases.
Do you know something?

40:50.500 --> 40:51.333
No.

40:52.916 --> 40:54.125
You think I don't care?

41:02.125 --> 41:05.916
Sometimes we have to do things
we don't like to uncover the truth.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.333
I'm not like you.

41:09.875 --> 41:12.583
-What do you mean?
-Why did they fire you?

41:16.875 --> 41:18.333
You investigated me.

41:21.625 --> 41:24.791
I'll look into it,
but promise me you won't interfere.

41:25.833 --> 41:27.000
You're not a cop.

41:29.750 --> 41:30.791
I have to go.

41:45.583 --> 41:48.000
Alicia, I need a favor.

41:51.250 --> 41:53.000
<i>I brought this. It's your son's.</i>

41:53.708 --> 41:55.583
<i>-Thanks.</i>
<i>-Do you go hunting?</i>

41:55.666 --> 41:58.958
<i>Yes, I can station myself</i>
<i>at the Los Castillos post.</i>

42:01.333 --> 42:02.250
Come in.

42:02.958 --> 42:04.291
Sorry, but

42:05.250 --> 42:08.416
this house lacks a woman's touch.

42:10.541 --> 42:13.125
My boy Juan's mom passed away a while ago.

42:13.208 --> 42:16.041
The two of us manage as best we can.

42:17.083 --> 42:18.125
Go ahead.

42:19.625 --> 42:22.666
I know you're a hunter
and Juan meant well,

42:24.125 --> 42:26.250
but guns are off-limits for my son.

42:26.750 --> 42:29.916
I'll deal with Juan,
and it won't happen again.

42:30.708 --> 42:31.958
I appreciate it.

42:33.583 --> 42:35.583
I see you work for the Carrerases.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.375
My family has always worked for them.

42:38.875 --> 42:41.500
Juan works at their farm too?

42:42.000 --> 42:42.875
No.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.500
My boy is studying.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.500
Did you see Samanta Sosa
the night of the party?

42:50.125 --> 42:51.125
No.

42:51.916 --> 42:53.250
I wasn't at the party.

42:54.166 --> 42:56.708
I was tracking the cougar
and found her dead.

42:58.333 --> 43:01.916
Well, Ms. Manuela, if you'll excuse me…

43:02.875 --> 43:03.708
Okay.

43:10.333 --> 43:12.833
<i>She'll talk to you, not with the police.</i>

43:12.916 --> 43:13.916
Thank you.

43:15.541 --> 43:16.833
Don't thank me.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.375
She's back because Alicia asked.

43:20.208 --> 43:24.000
If she thinks you can find out
what happened to Sami, fine.

43:24.958 --> 43:26.458
But no one can know.

43:27.666 --> 43:29.000
Including Rufino.

43:31.708 --> 43:32.541
Okay.

43:34.375 --> 43:35.208
Where is she?

43:47.541 --> 43:49.500
Anything you can tell me is useful.

43:51.291 --> 43:53.666
Sami was having the best night ever.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.708
<i>Looked like a princess.</i>

44:03.750 --> 44:05.250
Mirror, mirror on the wall…

44:07.041 --> 44:09.708
-who's the fairest of them all?
-Grow up.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.208
Your jokes disgust me.

44:14.416 --> 44:17.750
You gave my favorite necklace
to that grubby Indian.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.375
Are you jealous?

44:21.291 --> 44:23.208
Are you for real, Cruz? Stop.

44:25.625 --> 44:28.166
You know you're the only one I care about.

44:38.541 --> 44:39.458
Did you go crazy?

44:39.541 --> 44:41.875
-Ms. Mecha is furious.
-What for?

44:42.416 --> 44:44.250
-Her necklace.
-Cruz gave it to me.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.875
Return it and get back to work.
Estela can't know.

44:46.958 --> 44:49.000
The boss is not who you think.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.333
The boss never cared for us.

44:51.416 --> 44:52.625
He does for me.

44:52.708 --> 44:56.416
He'll take me to tomorrow's game
and introduce me to important people.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.583
He says I can model if I want.

44:59.083 --> 45:01.875
Don't let him fool you.
He's just annoying his sister.

45:01.958 --> 45:03.458
Why are you saying that?

45:03.541 --> 45:04.583
You're jealous.

45:05.958 --> 45:08.500
What are you doing?
You're ruining everything.

45:08.583 --> 45:09.583
Want me to be happy?

45:09.666 --> 45:11.875
Give those things back while you can.

45:11.958 --> 45:13.333
It's not too late.

45:32.833 --> 45:34.541
That's the last I saw of her.

45:40.125 --> 45:42.166
Had I insisted, she might be alive.

45:42.250 --> 45:44.125
None of it is your fault.

45:44.208 --> 45:45.833
You should understand that.

45:45.916 --> 45:48.708
Luna said that,
but you don't know how I feel.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.416
I do know.

45:52.041 --> 45:57.208
Years ago I lost a friend.
Cornelia. And it marked my life forever.

45:59.416 --> 46:01.250
But not because she passed,

46:02.583 --> 46:07.583
but because I felt responsible
for not having done enough to help her.

46:07.666 --> 46:09.875
What did you do to stop that feeling?

46:11.583 --> 46:12.458
I did nothing.

46:14.583 --> 46:16.708
I still think I could have saved her.

46:56.916 --> 46:58.125
What do you drink?

47:00.375 --> 47:01.208
The same.

47:11.958 --> 47:13.500
I've never seen you here.

47:18.291 --> 47:19.125
That's odd.

47:19.625 --> 47:21.125
So, what do you think?

47:22.208 --> 47:25.041
Is an age difference a problem for you?

47:25.541 --> 47:26.375
No.

47:29.125 --> 47:29.958
For you?

47:34.291 --> 47:35.875
She was 16.

47:36.708 --> 47:37.958
What's this?

47:38.541 --> 47:41.083
At your party.
You gave her your sister's necklace.

47:41.791 --> 47:42.625
Yes.

47:43.250 --> 47:44.583
We were having fun.

47:45.083 --> 47:48.041
Except she turned up scorched
somewhere in the sticks.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.166
What?

47:50.416 --> 47:52.291
I didn't know she was dead.

47:53.250 --> 47:56.583
Listen up. Everyone saw the two of you.

47:56.666 --> 47:57.875
And she was found dead.

47:58.708 --> 48:00.458
What happened? What did you do?

48:00.541 --> 48:02.458
I didn't harm her. I swear.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.000
-Sorry. I should go.
-Don't, please.

48:09.083 --> 48:10.625
What happened at the party?

48:11.125 --> 48:13.291
-Nothing.
-Do you have her phone?

48:17.000 --> 48:17.833
Cruz.

48:18.541 --> 48:22.125
I've been calling you for an hour.
Go with your sister. She's tense.

48:22.208 --> 48:25.333
-I would be too if I had to marry Agustín.
-Stop, Cruz.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.083
I'll see you there.

48:27.166 --> 48:30.625
I'm sorry, but Mom's orders
must always be carried out.

48:36.458 --> 48:37.375
What do you need?

48:37.875 --> 48:39.333
Information.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.208
Would it be easier if I talk to you?

48:42.291 --> 48:45.291
I don't think we have a lot to talk about.

48:45.375 --> 48:46.458
Samanta Sosa.

48:47.166 --> 48:49.000
Worked for you the night she died.

48:49.083 --> 48:51.458
Yes, I heard. Poor girl.

48:52.083 --> 48:54.833
If her family needs help, just come to us.

48:54.916 --> 48:58.583
-There's no need to involve my son.
-But your son knew her.

48:58.666 --> 49:01.333
He knows a lot of people,
but I doubt he knew her.

49:01.416 --> 49:04.791
Cruz gets mixed up.
Don't believe everything he says.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.791
His health is delicate.

49:06.875 --> 49:08.916
And do you look after him?

49:09.625 --> 49:10.666
Yes.

49:11.666 --> 49:12.791
Just like you.

49:14.166 --> 49:15.708
You're a mom too, right?

49:17.875 --> 49:20.000
It's an important day for my family.

49:20.083 --> 49:22.750
Please leave your questions
for another time.

49:23.583 --> 49:26.791
I know about your aunt's work
with the communities.

49:26.875 --> 49:28.250
I respect her for that.

49:28.333 --> 49:30.791
We help out too.

49:30.875 --> 49:33.083
We did even before she came here.

49:33.166 --> 49:35.791
They claim the land
the mining company wants.

49:35.875 --> 49:37.416
Will you help with that?

49:37.500 --> 49:40.291
The land has been
in the family for generations.

49:40.375 --> 49:44.375
If it's a matter of ancestral claims,
theirs go a bit further back.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.875
I see now the topic interests you.

49:47.833 --> 49:50.583
I pegged you as someone
who liked her solitude.

49:51.291 --> 49:52.416
You don't know me.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.541
You're right. You don't know me either.

49:57.041 --> 49:58.291
If you'll excuse me…

49:58.791 --> 49:59.875
Manuela, right?

50:00.833 --> 50:01.791
Manuela Pelari.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.375
I go by Pipa.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.375
Good night to you, Pipa.

50:08.625 --> 50:10.250
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

50:10.750 --> 50:12.166
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

50:13.333 --> 50:17.458
I'd like to say
this union makes me very happy.

50:18.875 --> 50:20.458
And on today's engagement,

50:20.541 --> 50:23.791
we'll set a date for the wedding,
and a year from now,

50:24.583 --> 50:29.541
these two young lovebirds
will join their lives forever.

50:30.875 --> 50:32.208
And two close families

50:33.041 --> 50:34.291
will become one.

50:35.625 --> 50:36.625
Welcome, my dear.

50:37.541 --> 50:38.375
Thanks, Dad.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.291
Thank you, Rómulo.

50:42.625 --> 50:44.666
This is the happiest day of my life.

50:45.541 --> 50:48.583
To be topped only
by the day I walk down the aisle

50:49.125 --> 50:50.458
on my brother's arm.

50:51.750 --> 50:54.666
As you know,
this is a longtime dream of mine.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.833
And it came true, my love.

50:59.750 --> 51:02.541
To the future,
and to our children's happiness…

51:03.208 --> 51:04.666
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

51:04.750 --> 51:06.000
Hooray for the couple!

51:07.416 --> 51:09.208
Hooray for love!

51:13.958 --> 51:14.958
Cheers.

51:26.125 --> 51:27.250
So, you did come.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.416
I had to go somewhere first.

51:30.500 --> 51:33.958
Your call got me curious.
Is it personal or work-related?

51:34.041 --> 51:35.958
Both, I guess.

51:36.541 --> 51:38.375
I misjudged Cruz Carreras.

51:38.875 --> 51:40.083
Why is that?

51:40.750 --> 51:42.291
I was just with him.

51:42.375 --> 51:45.333
He learned from me
that Samanta was dead. Had no clue.

51:46.041 --> 51:48.541
-You were with the Carreras's boy?
-Yes.

51:48.625 --> 51:49.791
And the mother.

51:51.291 --> 51:53.583
I'm missing something. I don't know what.

51:54.291 --> 51:56.666
I need your report
and photos from the scene.

51:56.750 --> 51:59.791
Nothing I can do
will get you off this case, right?

51:59.875 --> 52:02.500
No. I don't want to get you in trouble.

52:03.833 --> 52:05.541
You don't care if you do.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.333
At least don't lie.

52:09.333 --> 52:12.041
If you want me as an accomplice,
answer this.

52:12.916 --> 52:14.166
Why'd you stand me up?

52:15.625 --> 52:16.625
Huh?

52:18.791 --> 52:19.833
I can't remember.

52:21.166 --> 52:22.333
It was so long ago.

52:31.833 --> 52:32.875
Fine.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.916
I'm not good at choosing men.

52:37.791 --> 52:39.916
How do you know? I never got a chance.

52:40.583 --> 52:41.750
It's not you.

52:43.541 --> 52:44.916
I'm poor company.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.250
Believe me.

52:46.333 --> 52:48.375
That should be for me to decide.

52:50.125 --> 52:52.875
-Maybe there's another reason.
-Why is it then?

52:52.958 --> 52:54.750
Out of fear of liking me.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.208
You don't know me.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.708
-We're very different.
-Then allow me to.

53:06.791 --> 53:08.583
Look what you did to it!

53:08.666 --> 53:11.041
Turn up the volume. Come on.

53:13.041 --> 53:15.041
<i>This is how La Quebrada Police treat us.</i>

53:15.833 --> 53:17.291
<i>White people's police.</i>

53:17.375 --> 53:19.916
INDIGENOUS LEADER AGAINST THE POLICE

53:20.000 --> 53:21.583
<i>No doctor was called.</i>

53:23.208 --> 53:24.958
<i>We need to be seen,</i>

53:25.583 --> 53:26.666
<i>to be heard.</i>

53:27.583 --> 53:29.083
<i>Will we keep allowing this?</i>

53:29.166 --> 53:30.166
It was Luna.

53:30.750 --> 53:31.875
I let her in.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.666
<i>Our community is in danger.</i>

53:36.041 --> 53:37.250
<i>It's our land.</i>

53:37.750 --> 53:38.875
<i>We have a right to it.</i>

53:40.250 --> 53:41.083
<i>Cut it off.</i>

53:41.166 --> 53:45.208
<i>Mayor Oregón's military arm</i>
<i>subjugates us. It doesn't protect us.</i>

53:45.791 --> 53:49.625
<i>That's what happened</i>
<i>with Nahuel Mamani's violent arrest.</i>

53:50.125 --> 53:51.416
<i>And that's not all.</i>

53:51.500 --> 53:53.500
<i>What really happened to Samanta Sosa?</i>

53:53.583 --> 53:54.416
CANDIDATE

53:54.500 --> 53:56.791
<i>Do you know the guy in the photo?</i>

53:56.875 --> 53:59.916
<i>It's Agustín Oregón, the mayor's son.</i>

54:00.583 --> 54:04.166
<i>That photo was taken</i>
<i>just hours before Sami was found dead.</i>

54:05.250 --> 54:08.583
<i>Those in power, and their kids,</i>
<i>have a lot to answer for.</i>

54:36.875 --> 54:38.291
That bastard.

54:40.416 --> 54:42.125
-What was that, Dad?
-Relax.

54:42.208 --> 54:44.000
I'm tired of your problems!

54:44.083 --> 54:47.041
-It has nothing to do with you.
-You're not in my shoes.

54:47.125 --> 54:49.375
Leave already. No one wants you here.

54:52.083 --> 54:53.416
-Agustín!
-No, Agustín.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.375
That's it, Mercedes.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.375
I have to get out of this fucking town!

54:59.458 --> 55:03.333
Let's leave now, get married in London,
and never come back!

55:04.916 --> 55:06.291
What's so funny?

55:08.541 --> 55:10.000
-Agustín.
-Don't!

55:50.583 --> 55:52.750
Registration, please, miss.

55:59.750 --> 56:01.625
Why was I pulled over?

56:01.708 --> 56:02.833
Checkpoint.

56:10.416 --> 56:12.083
I have a suggestion for you.

56:14.708 --> 56:17.000
Mind your own business from now on.

56:18.000 --> 56:18.958
Get it?

56:19.583 --> 56:20.500
No, I don't.

56:21.541 --> 56:26.750
If you keep bugging the Carrerases,
you'll be facing harassment charges.

56:27.541 --> 56:31.541
And I won't be as nice as I am now
when I have to bring you in.

56:32.041 --> 56:34.416
So, listen to me very carefully.

56:35.958 --> 56:37.708
Keep being such a pain,

56:37.791 --> 56:42.708
and not even your white face
or those slutty eyes will save you.

56:44.958 --> 56:45.875
That clear?

56:46.916 --> 56:47.791
I'm waiting.

56:49.166 --> 56:50.041
Yes, it's clear.

56:52.708 --> 56:53.583
Here you go.

57:30.833 --> 57:32.000
Your fiancé approved?

57:33.458 --> 57:34.291
Does it hurt?

57:39.208 --> 57:41.041
I needed to come too.

57:43.083 --> 57:44.500
It's my favorite place.

57:45.166 --> 57:46.708
Our best years.

57:49.625 --> 57:51.000
I wish we could go back.

58:00.500 --> 58:02.083
What I did was wrong, Mecha.

58:05.375 --> 58:08.625
-I can't get it out of my head.
-It was an accident.

58:09.791 --> 58:12.416
You did it for me, to protect me.

58:14.416 --> 58:16.875
Like when I almost drowned here as a girl.

58:16.958 --> 58:18.666
You saved me. Remember?

58:19.166 --> 58:20.083
The same way.

58:21.958 --> 58:23.541
Now I'm the one drowning.

58:25.833 --> 58:27.500
You can't leave me alone.

58:28.875 --> 58:30.000
You'll leave me.

58:33.333 --> 58:34.708
Why didn't you tell me?

58:38.416 --> 58:39.291
I don't know.

58:42.041 --> 58:43.500
I didn't know how.

58:47.291 --> 58:48.125
Look at me.

58:52.125 --> 58:54.208
Stop hurting yourself. Promise me.

58:56.875 --> 58:57.708
Okay?

59:00.958 --> 59:01.958
Do it for me.

59:07.083 --> 59:10.458
You leaked María's photo
of Samanta with the mayor's son.

59:10.541 --> 59:12.875
We needed to be heard, to be seen.

59:13.375 --> 59:16.000
You exposed María
and messed up the inquiry.

59:16.083 --> 59:19.000
You don't know if he was in on it,
yet you implicated him.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.416
So that Oregón loses?

59:21.916 --> 59:23.583
Someone killed Samanta.

59:24.250 --> 59:25.083
Do you care?

59:25.583 --> 59:27.833
And you? Are you okay with this?

59:27.916 --> 59:29.583
It's their land.

59:29.666 --> 59:31.166
You asked me for help.

59:31.791 --> 59:34.875
You only see part of the problem
we have on our hands.

59:34.958 --> 59:38.541
You don't know what's at stake.
They've ruled for ages,

59:38.625 --> 59:41.041
go unpunished, run the town, and use us.

59:41.125 --> 59:43.250
They make a fortune off our land.

59:43.916 --> 59:47.375
If Oregón loses,
we may have a shot at getting it back.

59:47.458 --> 59:48.583
What about Samanta?

59:48.666 --> 59:53.250
Whatever your intentions, if we never find
out what happened, you're no different.

59:53.333 --> 59:54.750
I'll never be like them.

59:55.750 --> 59:57.458
You think we can choose?

59:58.083 --> 59:58.958
We can't.

59:59.458 --> 1:00:00.750
Neither did Samanta.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:04.500
I should leave you two alone.

1:00:09.416 --> 1:00:10.250
Manuela,

1:00:10.916 --> 1:00:12.458
they have their reasons.

1:00:12.541 --> 1:00:14.000
You can't judge them.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:17.708
Besides, the scandal can help.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:19.916
Sami's death is all over the news.

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.500
There's nothing conclusive.
No proof, no suspects,

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:28.625
and no motive except
for some circumstantial photos at a place

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:30.833
and a time not coinciding with her death.

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:35.541
I lost my way.

1:00:36.125 --> 1:00:37.833
Follow the winding road.

1:00:39.208 --> 1:00:40.791
A cop threatened me last night.

1:00:46.166 --> 1:00:50.791
They work for the Carrerases
and came for me after I talked to Cruz.

1:00:51.875 --> 1:00:54.375
Everyone here works for the Carrerases.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:55.833
Yes.

1:00:59.125 --> 1:01:00.000
Everyone.

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:01.916
Silence, please.

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:04.541
Dear journalists,

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:07.958
not everything goes in politics.

1:01:08.458 --> 1:01:09.500
Of course not.

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:13.416
But candidate Torres
seems oblivious to this fact.

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:18.458
My family and I were pained
to see him on the news last night,

1:01:19.208 --> 1:01:21.583
playing dirty by framing my son Agustín

1:01:21.666 --> 1:01:23.958
with a photo taken out of context.

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:27.041
And I'm not worried because my son Agustín

1:01:27.125 --> 1:01:29.666
has nothing to hide
and can defend himself.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:32.916
But young Samanta Sosa

1:01:33.875 --> 1:01:34.750
can't do that.

1:01:35.375 --> 1:01:39.875
And it worries me that they'd use
her death to get a few votes.

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:42.000
We won't allow that.

1:01:42.083 --> 1:01:44.208
I agree with the mayor.

1:01:45.125 --> 1:01:48.750
At the precinct that I run,
we're investigating this tragedy,

1:01:48.833 --> 1:01:53.750
and since the beginning, the inquiry
has been overseen by Mr. Rufino Jerez,

1:01:54.750 --> 1:01:58.083
a respectful and valued member
of the Qulla community.

1:01:59.666 --> 1:02:01.125
Thank you, Captain.

1:02:02.166 --> 1:02:04.916
I think I have something. Paredes lied.

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.875
He said he wasn't at the party,
but he went by my house dressed up.

1:02:08.958 --> 1:02:10.458
Then María confirmed it.

1:02:11.041 --> 1:02:13.666
Whoever it was,
they may plan to disappear.

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:16.208
I'll watch the Los Castillos post.

1:02:17.041 --> 1:02:21.208
Preliminary autopsy reports
rule out firearms and sharp weapons.

1:02:21.291 --> 1:02:24.666
Agent Jerez,
after Nahuel Mamani's video went viral

1:02:24.750 --> 1:02:30.791
with the report of his brutal beating
at the hands of the police,

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:31.958
how do you respond?

1:02:32.041 --> 1:02:34.708
-About that topic--
-Good question.

1:02:34.791 --> 1:02:37.166
Sorry, Jerez. I'll be responding.

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:39.041
Precisely to inform you

1:02:39.125 --> 1:02:41.958
that Officer García,
who's in charge of the operation,

1:02:42.666 --> 1:02:44.625
has been discharged from the force.

1:02:44.708 --> 1:02:45.750
What is unclear--

1:02:45.833 --> 1:02:48.708
La Quebrada needs to be a paradise again.

1:02:48.791 --> 1:02:52.166
So, please don't fall victim
to Torres's manipulations.

1:02:52.250 --> 1:02:55.791
So that our town
can go back to having progress and peace.

1:03:55.125 --> 1:03:56.583
What are you doing here?

1:04:00.166 --> 1:04:01.333
I want to talk to you.

1:04:03.541 --> 1:04:06.708
You've been spying on me for a while.
Why is that?

1:04:07.458 --> 1:04:08.958
Why did you lie to me?

1:04:10.666 --> 1:04:12.416
Why deny going to the party?

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:13.958
-Leave.
-No.

1:04:14.708 --> 1:04:17.916
You were tracking Samanta, not the cougar.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.750
-What do you want?
-To help you.

1:04:19.833 --> 1:04:22.666
I'll do my best
if you tell me what happened.

1:04:22.750 --> 1:04:25.125
You don't know what you're getting into.

1:04:26.875 --> 1:04:28.625
You followed her after the party.

1:04:28.708 --> 1:04:31.708
All the way to my house, to the post.

1:04:31.791 --> 1:04:32.958
What happened?

1:04:33.041 --> 1:04:34.500
Why did you chase her?

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:36.791
Did she seem different then?

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.250
Did she reject any advances from you?

1:04:40.833 --> 1:04:42.875
What are you suggesting?

1:04:43.416 --> 1:04:45.541
She led you on all night, right?

1:04:46.291 --> 1:04:47.708
You couldn't resist?

1:04:48.541 --> 1:04:50.958
You were alone with her
in the middle of nowhere,

1:04:52.291 --> 1:04:53.375
you forced her,

1:04:54.541 --> 1:04:55.833
she fought back,

1:04:56.541 --> 1:04:57.458
and you got mad.

1:04:57.541 --> 1:04:58.375
No.

1:05:01.875 --> 1:05:03.291
I'm not a pervert.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:10.916
It was an accident… right?

1:05:12.750 --> 1:05:13.625
A mistake?

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:16.916
What happened?

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:22.333
I never meant to hurt her.

1:05:34.666 --> 1:05:35.708
Let's go.

1:05:36.791 --> 1:05:37.666
Come on.

1:05:56.791 --> 1:05:58.791
Chop-chop.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:03.416
-Go on, let's move!
-Okay, I'm coming!

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:20.500
Turn yourself in.

1:06:20.583 --> 1:06:21.416
No.

1:06:22.666 --> 1:06:23.541
No.

1:06:23.625 --> 1:06:27.625
That girl was in the wrong place,
like you are now. Do you get it?

1:06:27.708 --> 1:06:30.791
Why did you look for her?
What did you want from her?

1:06:30.875 --> 1:06:31.708
Go on.

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:37.458
What will you do?

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:40.625
Will you kill me too?

1:06:41.541 --> 1:06:42.375
Leave.

1:06:49.125 --> 1:06:50.250
Drop the gun!

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:52.875
Come out with your hands up!

1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:57.416
Are you okay?

1:06:57.916 --> 1:06:59.708
Yes. He fled through the back.

1:07:12.708 --> 1:07:14.791
-Will you be okay alone?
-Yes.

1:07:14.875 --> 1:07:16.875
Tobías will stay with Alicia.

1:07:16.958 --> 1:07:20.875
Accept police protection.
Paredes could come back.

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:23.833
No, thanks. I'd rather look after myself.

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:26.083
Your partner almost blew my brains out.

1:07:26.708 --> 1:07:29.458
We asked the capital
for backup to find him.

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:31.375
He knows the area.

1:07:31.458 --> 1:07:35.000
He wasn't going to kill me.
He was about to turn himself in.

1:07:36.625 --> 1:07:38.041
He'll only come for his son.

1:07:38.791 --> 1:07:39.875
He killed Samanta.

1:07:39.958 --> 1:07:41.000
Yes, but why?

1:07:41.750 --> 1:07:45.416
Besides, he smothered her,
but it was not a premeditated crime.

1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:48.125
He wouldn't do the fake fire setup.

1:07:50.125 --> 1:07:51.250
That was planned.

1:07:52.041 --> 1:07:55.333
Designed to erase something he did.
He has an accomplice.

1:07:55.416 --> 1:07:56.583
There's a cover-up.

1:07:57.208 --> 1:08:00.500
I hurt the guy who broke into my house.
Paredes was fine.

1:08:00.583 --> 1:08:01.750
Are you positive?

1:08:01.833 --> 1:08:02.666
Yes.

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.166
Has Sami's phone been on?

1:08:05.250 --> 1:08:07.375
Yes, earlier at the valley's entrance.

1:08:08.041 --> 1:08:10.875
Please tell me when it's on.
Don't tell a soul.

1:08:13.666 --> 1:08:14.666
I need to go.

1:08:16.083 --> 1:08:19.916
I'm leading the investigation
only because it's now good for them.

1:08:21.958 --> 1:08:23.875
In any case, I'm responsible.

1:08:30.375 --> 1:08:31.208
Be careful.

1:08:32.833 --> 1:08:33.791
You too.

1:08:57.833 --> 1:08:59.333
What are you doing here?

1:08:59.416 --> 1:09:01.333
The police are looking for you.

1:09:05.416 --> 1:09:07.541
What happens to my son if I go to jail?

1:09:07.625 --> 1:09:08.875
No jail for anyone.

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:11.625
Go to the backwoods
until things settle down.

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:16.291
Leave Juancito to me. Don't worry.
He'll have everything he needs.

1:09:16.791 --> 1:09:19.208
I was only following orders, ma'am.

1:09:19.291 --> 1:09:21.541
The responsibility is yours alone.

1:09:22.291 --> 1:09:24.166
I didn't ask you to kill anyone.

1:09:26.833 --> 1:09:28.083
Open up, Mom.

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:32.791
Leave, Luis.

1:09:42.291 --> 1:09:43.250
What did you do?

1:09:44.208 --> 1:09:45.208
They killed her.

1:09:45.958 --> 1:09:46.791
It was you.

1:09:47.416 --> 1:09:49.291
I was protecting you, as usual.

1:09:49.375 --> 1:09:50.875
No. From what?

1:09:53.916 --> 1:09:54.875
It wasn't me.

1:09:56.125 --> 1:09:58.208
Your stupid decisions killed her.

1:09:59.291 --> 1:10:00.125
She saw you.

1:10:01.208 --> 1:10:03.625
Otherwise, she would be unharmed.

1:10:04.583 --> 1:10:07.500
What did you want?
To make your sister jealous?

1:10:07.583 --> 1:10:08.583
Huh?

1:10:08.666 --> 1:10:11.333
Gave her your sister's clothes, necklace.

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:14.208
What were you thinking, son?

1:10:14.291 --> 1:10:17.541
They only want money to get pregnant.
Can't you see?

1:10:17.625 --> 1:10:20.125
That's not true. Not everyone is like you.

1:10:20.208 --> 1:10:23.458
Do you think I haven't heard?
Don't play saint with me.

1:10:26.416 --> 1:10:27.875
Do you think it hurts?

1:10:29.583 --> 1:10:30.958
I don't feel a thing.

1:10:32.208 --> 1:10:33.583
I don't care.

1:10:35.250 --> 1:10:36.583
I'm going to talk.

1:10:44.541 --> 1:10:45.375
Good day.

1:10:50.791 --> 1:10:52.125
Where's the paperwork?

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:57.291
Look who's here. The new boss.

1:10:57.375 --> 1:10:59.416
The new boss is here.

1:10:59.916 --> 1:11:02.791
I know, the new boss. I say hi, see?

1:11:05.041 --> 1:11:08.708
Okay, I'll piss off. I'm taking the van.

1:11:18.083 --> 1:11:19.916
ESTIMATED LOCATION
LOS CASTILLOS

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.833
GPS TRACKING ON
SAMANTA SOSA

1:11:50.458 --> 1:11:52.166
Yes. I'll handle it.

1:12:13.208 --> 1:12:16.166
<i>Her phone was turned on</i>
<i>in the Los Castillos area.</i>

1:12:16.250 --> 1:12:17.250
Hold on.

1:12:30.208 --> 1:12:31.166
LOS CASTILLOS GULLY

1:12:31.250 --> 1:12:33.458
Paredes found
the cougar's last tracks there.

1:12:34.208 --> 1:12:35.166
<i>There's more.</i>

1:12:35.250 --> 1:12:38.291
Other policemen are on their way
to track the phone.

1:12:39.125 --> 1:12:40.625
Mellino's orders.

1:12:40.708 --> 1:12:43.041
So, it was them who broke into my house.

1:12:44.958 --> 1:12:47.125
That phone must have something on it.

1:12:47.208 --> 1:12:48.041
Yes.

1:12:48.833 --> 1:12:49.958
But who has it?

1:12:51.833 --> 1:12:53.250
Take a photo as proof.

1:12:58.958 --> 1:12:59.791
What is it?

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:00.875
Tracks.

1:13:01.416 --> 1:13:02.333
Whose tracks?

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:03.833
A cougar's.

1:13:22.125 --> 1:13:23.750
-Boy.
-Why are you here?

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:27.875
To talk to you.

1:13:29.083 --> 1:13:29.958
About what?

1:13:32.041 --> 1:13:33.166
Take my statement.

1:13:33.791 --> 1:13:35.083
Think.

1:13:35.750 --> 1:13:37.750
You have nothing to say to the police.

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:42.333
-I did something awful.
-That means squat.

1:13:43.458 --> 1:13:45.916
Who you are and what you'll do
means something.

1:13:49.791 --> 1:13:50.791
Look that way.

1:13:52.833 --> 1:13:54.041
That is your town.

1:13:54.708 --> 1:13:55.916
It's your land.

1:13:56.916 --> 1:13:58.791
Your legacy is your duty.

1:14:00.750 --> 1:14:02.916
Your mom is managing everything now.

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:06.833
When the time comes,
it'll be your duty, boy, to step in.

1:14:06.916 --> 1:14:10.041
-I don't want to.
-You don't understand, dammit!

1:14:12.166 --> 1:14:13.041
Listen, Cruz.

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:14.750
Look at me.

1:14:18.333 --> 1:14:20.791
Being a Carreras isn't a choice.

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:23.583
That's how it is.

1:14:26.041 --> 1:14:28.666
No officer will take your statement.

1:14:31.458 --> 1:14:32.958
Go back home right now.

1:14:33.708 --> 1:14:35.500
Your mom's worried sick.

1:15:03.541 --> 1:15:04.750
Let's turn around.

1:15:05.875 --> 1:15:06.875
We can't go through.

1:15:08.875 --> 1:15:10.000
They want Mamani.

1:15:11.250 --> 1:15:14.333
-I'll call for backup.
-No, I'll handle it.

1:15:15.416 --> 1:15:17.083
Stay with the detainee.

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:37.541
-No recordings. Put that away.
-Go on.

1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:41.916
So, you're calling the shots.

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.958
Our freedom of expression
with a peaceful demonstration.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:46.416
Worried about Mamani?

1:15:48.125 --> 1:15:49.500
Mamani?

1:15:49.583 --> 1:15:50.541
Bring him.

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:53.791
Damn it…

1:15:55.208 --> 1:15:57.541
Come on here, Mamani, get here.

1:15:57.625 --> 1:15:59.208
There's your Mamani. Look.

1:15:59.291 --> 1:16:00.791
There he is.

1:16:00.875 --> 1:16:02.416
Hey, no contact.

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.916
-Don't touch her, you bastard.
-Shut up.

1:16:07.583 --> 1:16:12.083
As long as it's not the whore bitch
that popped you out, dirty Indian.

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000
Stand up. I didn't hurt you.

1:16:15.583 --> 1:16:18.708
And you, you can't take a criminal,
understood?

1:16:18.791 --> 1:16:21.583
If he is a criminal, then I am too.

1:16:31.916 --> 1:16:34.250
Grandpa also wants to play hero.

1:16:34.333 --> 1:16:36.166
Come detain him. Take him.

1:16:37.291 --> 1:16:39.291
Handcuff him. Come on.

1:16:39.375 --> 1:16:42.125
Cuff them, quickly.
One by one, they'll fall.

1:16:45.208 --> 1:16:46.583
Go on, do it.

1:17:11.791 --> 1:17:15.208
Call Jerez so he can bring the van
and I can take them all.

1:17:23.291 --> 1:17:24.666
LOS CASTILLOS - 45 KM

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:01.625
Show me the gun, okay?

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:03.041
Sure.

1:18:04.416 --> 1:18:06.208
-Yeah, it's great.
-It is.

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:08.250
-Can I shoot?
-No, it's my mom's.

1:18:24.083 --> 1:18:26.666
-What do I do if the cougar comes?
-Run, I guess.

1:18:26.750 --> 1:18:29.250
According to Juan,
if you do, it'll attack.

1:18:29.333 --> 1:18:30.750
Oh, fine.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:37.958
The cougar!

1:18:43.708 --> 1:18:45.500
Fucking kids!

1:18:45.583 --> 1:18:47.000
You'll all be arrested.

1:18:48.333 --> 1:18:49.375
Go, get them!

1:19:01.458 --> 1:19:02.458
Paredes!

1:19:04.708 --> 1:19:05.875
I'll get you!

1:19:41.166 --> 1:19:42.125
Give me the phone!

1:19:42.208 --> 1:19:43.625
-I don't have it.
-Who does?

1:19:43.708 --> 1:19:44.875
-Tobías.
-Who?

1:19:44.958 --> 1:19:46.166
Tobías Pelari.

1:19:46.250 --> 1:19:48.041
Get lost! Get going!

1:19:52.333 --> 1:19:54.375
You're not going anywhere, boy.

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:56.625
Stop it!

1:19:56.708 --> 1:19:58.041
Settle down!

1:20:05.416 --> 1:20:06.250
Come, boy!

1:20:07.083 --> 1:20:08.375
Come back, boy!

1:20:21.791 --> 1:20:24.083
ESTIMATED LOCATION
LOS CASTILLOS

1:20:24.166 --> 1:20:26.625
Jerez, it's been five minutes.

1:20:27.125 --> 1:20:30.041
Luna, if you take him,
he'll become a fugitive.

1:20:30.625 --> 1:20:32.000
Will he live in hiding?

1:20:32.083 --> 1:20:33.083
Rufino's right.

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:36.375
Okay, I'm done waiting.

1:20:36.458 --> 1:20:37.875
Come on, handcuff her.

1:20:38.625 --> 1:20:39.458
Go.

1:20:39.541 --> 1:20:41.416
Want to face disciplinary action?

1:20:42.125 --> 1:20:45.083
I am responsible
for Mamani's protection, not you.

1:20:45.750 --> 1:20:49.166
You're not telling me what to do.
I'm your senior officer.

1:20:49.250 --> 1:20:52.666
I am now an actual officer
appointed to Samanta's case.

1:20:52.750 --> 1:20:55.208
You think you'll get a medal for that,
stupid?

1:20:56.041 --> 1:20:58.125
-I said, do it.
-No.

1:20:58.958 --> 1:21:00.500
Lala, let him go.

1:21:00.583 --> 1:21:01.583
Take him.

1:21:02.666 --> 1:21:05.875
Oh, so you're with the half-caste too.

1:21:05.958 --> 1:21:07.500
You bunch of wimps.

1:21:08.125 --> 1:21:11.500
I guarantee his safety
and due diligence in his statement.

1:21:12.083 --> 1:21:12.958
Trust me.

1:21:13.583 --> 1:21:14.833
I know what I'm doing.

1:21:16.625 --> 1:21:17.750
Okay.

1:21:19.791 --> 1:21:20.916
Let's go.

1:21:29.916 --> 1:21:31.083
You're a traitor.

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:33.125
Expect disciplinary action.

1:21:56.458 --> 1:21:58.083
We'll see what the boss says.

1:22:09.375 --> 1:22:10.250
What's with you?

1:22:11.083 --> 1:22:14.625
You broke into Manuela Pelari's home
to get Sami's phone.

1:22:15.250 --> 1:22:18.041
-Where did you get hurt?
-Are you accusing me?

1:22:18.125 --> 1:22:21.125
I know you're involved
in the cover-up of her death.

1:22:21.208 --> 1:22:22.750
So, what do you want?

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:27.166
For you to think about what will be
best for you when all this comes out.

1:22:28.333 --> 1:22:32.666
If you help, your involvement is minor,
unlike what's behind it.

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:35.583
Mellino will handle it.

1:22:35.666 --> 1:22:37.916
Maybe, maybe not.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:44.250
Fine.

1:22:52.041 --> 1:22:55.041
Hey, what are you doing?

1:22:56.083 --> 1:23:00.166
What are you doing? Fuck you, asshole!

1:23:10.458 --> 1:23:13.708
-Why are you here? What's wrong?
-We tracked the cougar.

1:23:15.333 --> 1:23:17.041
Do you have Samanta's phone?

1:23:17.125 --> 1:23:20.208
El Suqu does.
He was recording the hunt for you.

1:23:42.250 --> 1:23:44.166
Hey! What happened?

1:23:44.666 --> 1:23:46.625
-Where were you?
-I didn't mean to.

1:23:47.125 --> 1:23:48.708
I didn't mean to shoot.

1:23:48.791 --> 1:23:51.041
Calm down. What are you talking about?

1:23:52.708 --> 1:23:53.916
We were hunting.

1:23:57.583 --> 1:23:59.875
You had a gun?

1:24:01.083 --> 1:24:01.958
Yes.

1:24:02.833 --> 1:24:03.666
Mom's gun.

1:24:04.958 --> 1:24:08.250
It went off and the policeman fell.
I'm going to jail.

1:24:08.333 --> 1:24:09.875
No, honey.

1:24:10.791 --> 1:24:12.458
No one's going to jail.

1:24:12.541 --> 1:24:14.750
Yes. They're looking for me.

1:24:16.333 --> 1:24:17.875
They wanted the phone.

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:23.916
I found it outside the yard.

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.125
I didn't steal it.
I swear I meant to give it back.

1:24:49.041 --> 1:24:51.458
Are the police looking for it?

1:24:56.291 --> 1:24:57.333
Are you sure?

1:25:48.250 --> 1:25:49.083
Auntie.

1:25:57.541 --> 1:25:58.375
Auntie.

1:26:00.458 --> 1:26:01.333
Auntie.

1:26:10.458 --> 1:26:14.750
Go look for your mom
through the back door. Run and don't stop.

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.375
Tell her everything
and give her the phone.

1:26:57.458 --> 1:26:58.375
Cruz.

1:26:59.833 --> 1:27:00.750
Hi, Mecha.

1:27:01.583 --> 1:27:03.041
<i>Cruz, where are you?</i>

1:27:04.083 --> 1:27:05.083
I'll go find you.

1:27:06.583 --> 1:27:08.083
Did you know they killed her?

1:27:08.583 --> 1:27:09.708
Yes.

1:27:11.625 --> 1:27:13.291
I wanted to tell you.

1:27:14.416 --> 1:27:16.833
Everything. I shouldn't have lied.

1:27:19.916 --> 1:27:20.916
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:27:21.416 --> 1:27:22.458
<i>Let me help you.</i>

1:27:23.125 --> 1:27:25.125
I can't even say what I did.

1:27:27.291 --> 1:27:29.291
I'm tired of feeling like shit.

1:27:30.541 --> 1:27:31.875
What are you saying?

1:27:33.666 --> 1:27:36.208
You were the most important person to me.

1:27:39.541 --> 1:27:40.375
What?

1:27:41.708 --> 1:27:42.708
I still am.

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:46.833
<i>I love you.</i>

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:01.291
Listen to what I'm going to tell you.

1:28:03.333 --> 1:28:04.375
It was my fault.

1:28:06.208 --> 1:28:07.208
It wasn't you,

1:28:08.250 --> 1:28:09.166
it was me.

1:28:11.458 --> 1:28:12.708
I killed him.

1:28:19.708 --> 1:28:20.666
Cruz?

1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:23.333
Cruz!

1:28:24.833 --> 1:28:25.666
Cruz!

1:28:31.166 --> 1:28:32.083
Cruz!

1:28:32.750 --> 1:28:33.875
Mom!

1:28:38.916 --> 1:28:39.791
Mom!

1:28:55.708 --> 1:28:59.666
No!

1:29:01.416 --> 1:29:03.250
No! Cruz!

1:29:08.125 --> 1:29:10.083
No!

1:29:10.166 --> 1:29:13.750
Mom!

1:29:36.583 --> 1:29:37.708
Captain.

1:29:39.208 --> 1:29:40.250
Is something up?

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:41.833
Alicia.

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:44.750
We need to discuss something important.
Can we come in?

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.375
I'd rather we talk here.

1:29:47.875 --> 1:29:50.000
Alicia, let's talk inside. Please.

1:30:41.375 --> 1:30:43.208
This is your niece's gun.

1:30:43.291 --> 1:30:45.125
What do I have to do with it?

1:30:45.208 --> 1:30:46.375
Pipa's not here.

1:30:46.458 --> 1:30:48.500
I'm looking for the boy, her son.

1:30:48.583 --> 1:30:51.041
-What for?
-He shot one of my men.

1:30:51.125 --> 1:30:53.458
It wasn't serious,
but things could get worse.

1:30:54.083 --> 1:30:56.125
Tobías could never do such a thing.

1:30:56.708 --> 1:30:59.458
He was armed
with other boys in the backwoods.

1:30:59.541 --> 1:31:02.166
My men found them
while tracking a fugitive.

1:31:06.500 --> 1:31:07.625
Alicia.

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:08.625
Will you answer?

1:31:24.958 --> 1:31:28.833
Look, Mellino, I told you
I don't know anything, and I'm alone.

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:33.083
The signal is still here,
and the horse is outside.

1:31:33.166 --> 1:31:35.625
Don't make me do
something I don't want to do.

1:31:37.625 --> 1:31:40.041
I know your nephew's here. Bring him now.

1:31:40.125 --> 1:31:41.041
No.

1:31:41.666 --> 1:31:43.833
Okay, García. Search the whole house.

1:31:44.708 --> 1:31:46.375
Fine!

1:31:47.833 --> 1:31:48.958
The boy's not here.

1:31:49.791 --> 1:31:51.541
But I have the phone.

1:31:52.875 --> 1:31:53.708
Okay.

1:31:54.333 --> 1:31:55.166
Fine.

1:31:56.208 --> 1:31:57.166
Listen, Alicia.

1:31:57.708 --> 1:32:01.000
You have my word
nothing will happen to Pipa or the kid.

1:32:02.083 --> 1:32:04.083
But this needs to end now.

1:32:04.166 --> 1:32:05.125
You're right.

1:32:14.875 --> 1:32:16.041
Chief?

1:32:19.416 --> 1:32:20.416
Follow her.

1:32:39.875 --> 1:32:42.125
Is Sami's phone with you or inside?

1:32:49.375 --> 1:32:50.500
How many did you see?

1:32:51.041 --> 1:32:51.875
Three of them.

1:33:14.333 --> 1:33:16.666
Get out of my house now.

1:33:53.958 --> 1:33:55.541
She wouldn't give us anything.

1:33:56.625 --> 1:33:58.666
Get every unit on Manuela Pelari

1:33:58.750 --> 1:34:00.125
for Alicia's murder.

1:34:00.208 --> 1:34:01.125
Yes, sir.

1:34:03.666 --> 1:34:04.916
What's up?

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.166
No signal. They turned it off.

1:34:07.250 --> 1:34:08.541
It must be close.

1:34:08.625 --> 1:34:09.458
The boy fled.

1:34:09.958 --> 1:34:11.583
On the horse, to the woods.

1:34:11.666 --> 1:34:12.500
Fuck!

1:34:13.125 --> 1:34:14.708
Come with me, you hear me?

1:34:14.791 --> 1:34:16.166
Go on, García, go!

1:34:16.708 --> 1:34:17.708
You stay here.

1:34:42.583 --> 1:34:44.375
You're tough, you old whore.

1:34:48.833 --> 1:34:50.250
You don't want to die?

1:34:56.625 --> 1:34:59.958
I don't understand
a damn thing you're saying.

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:01.833
I'll help a little.

1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.333
Now you'll see what your fate is.

1:35:37.291 --> 1:35:40.000
You're really hot, you slut.

1:35:40.083 --> 1:35:42.666
I feel lonely here.

1:35:43.208 --> 1:35:45.458
Don't you want to marry me? Huh?

1:36:41.833 --> 1:36:43.166
The cell phone.

1:36:44.166 --> 1:36:45.000
Yes.

1:36:47.250 --> 1:36:48.083
I've got it.

1:36:50.166 --> 1:36:51.833
Give it to Rufino.

1:36:57.083 --> 1:36:58.166
Go

1:36:59.208 --> 1:37:00.875
with Tobías.

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.416
Don't go looking for them.

1:37:12.291 --> 1:37:13.958
Promise me.

1:38:01.958 --> 1:38:04.083
<i>The boy's not here. He played us.</i>

1:38:20.541 --> 1:38:23.208
Hey, what's with you?

1:38:23.875 --> 1:38:25.083
Leave, Paco.

1:38:25.166 --> 1:38:27.416
Relax you two. Hey, it's me!

1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:30.625
-Get out!
-Get out of here, you pervert!

1:38:30.708 --> 1:38:33.208
You're calling me a pervert?

1:38:33.875 --> 1:38:34.708
Look at you.

1:38:35.333 --> 1:38:37.666
No. Don't start imagining things.

1:38:37.750 --> 1:38:40.416
-Easy.
-Not much left to the imagination.

1:38:42.541 --> 1:38:45.625
Shut up, you bitch!
You always wanted to fuck Cruz.

1:38:45.708 --> 1:38:47.125
Someone beat me to it.

1:38:47.208 --> 1:38:48.541
Stop, Mecha.

1:38:49.375 --> 1:38:50.791
-What? Stop.
-What's up?

1:38:50.875 --> 1:38:52.333
Relax.

1:38:52.416 --> 1:38:54.958
-You perv.
-I'll kill you, bastard!

1:38:55.041 --> 1:38:57.000
Why do you get like this?

1:38:57.083 --> 1:38:59.666
Get him out of here, Cruz!

1:38:59.750 --> 1:39:01.750
I'm not afraid of you, bitch Barbie!

1:39:03.666 --> 1:39:05.333
-Snap out of it.
-No.

1:39:05.416 --> 1:39:06.875
Hey, what's up with you?

1:39:07.833 --> 1:39:09.541
Get Mom. Call an ambulance.

1:39:09.625 --> 1:39:12.625
Mom? An ambulance?
Are you nuts? No one can see you.

1:39:12.708 --> 1:39:14.625
Get the SUV, we'll put him in.

1:39:14.708 --> 1:39:16.208
Don't tell a soul, okay?

1:39:16.708 --> 1:39:18.375
Come on, Cruz! Go!

1:39:18.458 --> 1:39:19.416
Go on.

1:39:25.583 --> 1:39:26.666
What happened?

1:39:27.833 --> 1:39:29.833
<i>What are you doing here, Paco?</i>

1:39:32.708 --> 1:39:33.833
Why did you come?

1:39:35.666 --> 1:39:37.041
You didn't have to.

1:39:43.500 --> 1:39:44.333
Cruz.

1:39:44.416 --> 1:39:45.625
Where did he go?

1:39:47.833 --> 1:39:49.666
I'll tell everyone, you'll see.

1:39:50.166 --> 1:39:52.166
What will your mom say now?

1:40:19.708 --> 1:40:21.416
No chip, they won't find us.

1:40:22.833 --> 1:40:24.375
I'll take you to the border.

1:40:27.125 --> 1:40:28.000
Come on.

1:40:31.458 --> 1:40:32.291
Does it hurt?

1:40:36.666 --> 1:40:37.541
A little.

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:03.500
<i>Calling all units.</i>

1:41:04.333 --> 1:41:07.958
<i>Arrest warrant for Manuela Pelari.</i>
<i>License plate 470.</i>

1:41:08.625 --> 1:41:09.500
Mom.

1:41:16.041 --> 1:41:17.083
Hold on tight.

1:41:33.333 --> 1:41:36.291
Unit 12 here.
Now in pursuit of the fugitive.

1:41:36.375 --> 1:41:38.541
Light blue Ford truck.

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.166
License plate VTG280.

1:41:42.250 --> 1:41:44.666
Engaging pursuit.
I repeat, engaging pursuit.

1:42:22.333 --> 1:42:24.166
Come on, lady!

1:42:29.250 --> 1:42:32.166
Move!

1:42:32.791 --> 1:42:34.583
Move!

1:42:35.208 --> 1:42:36.083
Come on!

1:42:45.958 --> 1:42:47.833
MINE CLOSED
AUTHORIZED ENTRY ONLY

1:42:47.916 --> 1:42:50.583
AREA CLOSED
NO ENTRY - NO TRESPASSING

1:42:54.833 --> 1:42:56.500
Pipa, where are you?

1:42:57.083 --> 1:42:58.916
<i>You're wanted for murder.</i>

1:42:59.458 --> 1:43:00.500
They killed her.

1:43:00.583 --> 1:43:01.791
<i>Mellino killed Alicia.</i>

1:43:02.375 --> 1:43:03.208
<i>What?</i>

1:43:03.291 --> 1:43:04.125
Go.

1:43:08.791 --> 1:43:09.833
<i>And Paredes too.</i>

1:43:12.041 --> 1:43:13.375
I have Sami's phone.

1:43:14.625 --> 1:43:16.625
I'm at the Pico del Águila mine.

1:43:18.041 --> 1:43:20.166
<i>I need you to come and take Tobías.</i>

1:43:20.250 --> 1:43:22.250
Take Tobías? What will you do?

1:43:24.125 --> 1:43:25.083
Pipa!

1:43:25.166 --> 1:43:29.250
DANGER
DO NOT ENTER

1:43:53.166 --> 1:43:55.541
-So, man?
-They're still inside, sir.

1:43:56.375 --> 1:43:58.000
Okay. Go to the crosswalk.

1:43:58.083 --> 1:43:59.875
No one comes in, you hear me?

1:43:59.958 --> 1:44:00.791
Yes, sir.

1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:09.458
It's a lot of blood.
She's running out of time.

1:44:09.541 --> 1:44:11.625
She must be all messed up.

1:45:10.875 --> 1:45:11.708
Mom.

1:45:13.125 --> 1:45:14.000
Mom.

1:45:16.541 --> 1:45:17.625
They're coming.

1:45:24.416 --> 1:45:25.291
Pelari!

1:45:37.375 --> 1:45:38.375
Go that way.

1:45:42.625 --> 1:45:44.583
You've got nowhere to run, Pelari.

1:45:45.541 --> 1:45:47.125
Give us the phone.

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:49.791
Enough people have died.

1:45:50.583 --> 1:45:51.750
You need to go.

1:45:52.791 --> 1:45:53.708
Go hide.

1:45:54.875 --> 1:45:55.916
Give it to Rufino.

1:45:57.500 --> 1:45:58.666
He will find you.

1:46:05.125 --> 1:46:06.750
I don't want to leave you.

1:46:08.250 --> 1:46:09.583
I love you, son.

1:46:16.666 --> 1:46:18.291
Go on. Now.

1:46:19.833 --> 1:46:20.666
Now.

1:46:21.750 --> 1:46:22.625
Go.

1:46:42.500 --> 1:46:43.625
Hey!

1:46:58.541 --> 1:46:59.583
Surrender it!

1:47:00.250 --> 1:47:01.291
García.

1:47:40.583 --> 1:47:41.875
The belt gun too.

1:47:50.625 --> 1:47:52.583
It didn't have to come to this.

1:47:53.125 --> 1:47:55.875
You know I am a magnet
for policemen like you.

1:47:58.625 --> 1:48:01.375
You told Paredes
to cover it up with the fire.

1:48:02.583 --> 1:48:04.125
Paredes is useless.

1:48:05.291 --> 1:48:08.083
He had to frighten her
and get the video back.

1:48:09.083 --> 1:48:10.916
But why did you help him?

1:48:12.041 --> 1:48:15.708
Why cover for the Carrerases?
You didn't have to get involved.

1:48:15.791 --> 1:48:18.458
I'm tired of cleaning up
after the Carrerases.

1:48:19.416 --> 1:48:22.583
-I didn't have a choice.
-That's not true.

1:48:23.916 --> 1:48:25.416
You didn't have to do it.

1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:26.458
Neither did you.

1:48:27.541 --> 1:48:28.583
Yet here we are.

1:48:29.250 --> 1:48:30.833
I'm protecting my son.

1:48:30.916 --> 1:48:32.291
Well, me too.

1:48:37.166 --> 1:48:38.291
Cruz?

1:48:39.583 --> 1:48:40.875
Give me the damn phone.

1:48:42.833 --> 1:48:43.666
I don't have it.

1:48:49.958 --> 1:48:50.791
No.

1:48:52.083 --> 1:48:53.500
No, Tobías. Put it down.

1:48:58.916 --> 1:49:00.500
Put the gun down, Tobías.

1:49:05.416 --> 1:49:06.500
Listen to me, boy.

1:49:06.583 --> 1:49:08.083
Give me the phone, okay?

1:49:09.833 --> 1:49:12.583
It's okay, Tobías. Give it to him.

1:49:19.958 --> 1:49:21.208
Forgive me, Mom.

1:49:24.250 --> 1:49:25.375
Okay.

1:50:04.333 --> 1:50:08.916
Do you swear to say the truth about
what you know, saw, heard, or perceived

1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.333
in connection to Samanta Sosa's murder?

1:50:11.416 --> 1:50:12.458
I solemnly swear.
