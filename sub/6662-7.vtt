00:05.088 --> 00:06.756
My name is Bridget.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.841
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.217
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.259 --> 00:10.719
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.554
And we'll protect you.

You don't get it.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.932
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.269
BRIDGET, VOICE-OVER: I ran
to my sister Siobhan for help.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.770
Siobhan! Siobhan!

00:20.812 --> 00:23.940
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.316
BRIDGET:
It was so easy.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.318
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.195
They all think that I'm her.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.363
BRIDGET, VOICE-OVER:
Her husband...

00:30.405 --> 00:32.365
It's Gemma.
She's missing.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.491
Her lover...

00:33.533 --> 00:35.326
Your wife
knows about us.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.245
She knows about
the affair,
the baby.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.747
Her best friend.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.999
I would like to report
someone missing.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.333
Gemma Butler.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.085
I think she was the victim
of foul play,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.713
and I can tell you where to
find the evidence to prove it.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.715
SALDANA: I caught a potential
missing-persons case today

00:48.757 --> 00:51.593
and found some fingerprints that
might be of interest to you.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.344
How you figure?

00:53.386 --> 00:56.181
SALDANA: I'm assuming the name
Bridget Kelly rings a bell?

01:00.435 --> 01:01.811
MAN: OK, here we go.

01:01.853 --> 01:02.937
Stay on him, OK?

REPORTER #2: Mr. Butler, when's
the last time you saw her?

REPORTER #1:
It's been over 48 hours
since Gemma went missing.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.782
Do you think
your wife is still alive?

REPORTER #3: Has there been
a request for ransom?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.994

your wife thinks you're
having an affair, Mr. Butler?

confirm rumors that you're
filing for a divorce?

anything to do with your wife's
disappearance, Mr. Butler?

I want my wife back.

questioning you about,
Mr. Butler?

Mr. Butler, what really
happened to your wife?

continuing to investigate
the disappearance

01:41.309 --> 01:43.603
of prominent New York architect
Gemma Butler.

Siobhan, come on.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.439
[turns off TV]

01:46.481 --> 01:47.607
You're stressing
yourself out.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.275
It's not good
for the baby.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.276
Sorry.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.738
It's hard not to watch.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.615
Press have publicly
indicted Henry,

01:55.657 --> 01:56.783
he's not even a suspect.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.701
It's unbelievable.
<b></b>
I know.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.412
Do you know
anyone we could hire?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.873
Like a private investigator?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.169
What? You don't think the police
are doing a good job?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.713
No, I'm sure they are.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.173
But just think about
how many people go missing

02:12.215 --> 02:13.424
every year
and are never found.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.218
Well, that's not
going to happen.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.846
Gemma's father is one
of the most powerful men
in the city.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.056
We have to trust that
the cops are on it.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.102
I, uh, spoke with
Henry this morning.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.771
He wants to know
if we're going to the
Art Pavilion opening.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.440
Is he going?
<b></b>
Well, he said he felt
he didn't have a choice.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.943
Took Gemma over
two years to oversee
the construction

02:31.985 --> 02:35.697
of the building
and to design it.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.449
He wants to honor
his wife.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.951
[phone ringing]
<b></b>
He doesn't realize

02:39.993 --> 02:41.369
that the whole point
of the evening

02:41.411 --> 02:42.787
will be completely
overshadowed.

[elevator bell dings]

02:44.080 --> 02:45.165
Dad?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.626
BRIDGET:
Yes, they just got here.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.961
Thank you.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.254
Really, Juliet?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.547
Oh, thanks a lot, Dad.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.174
They're not here for me.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.342
Just a few questions,
Mrs. Martin?

02:56.384 --> 02:57.886
We believe you have
vital information

02:57.927 --> 02:59.721
regarding Gemma Butler's
disappearance.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.181
Did you find Gemma?

03:01.222 --> 03:03.600
Juliet, you should
get ready for school.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.646
We can speak
in the living room.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.441
Actually, we'd prefer
to do this down
at the precinct.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.775
Is that necessary?

03:12.817 --> 03:14.485
We've identified a suspect

03:14.527 --> 03:16.779
in connection to
Mrs. Butler's disappearance.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.323
The case is now
a joint investigation

03:18.364 --> 03:20.325
with the NYPD and the FBI.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.993
This is a
federal case?

03:22.035 --> 03:24.829
I know that you have a lot
of questions, Mr. Martin.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.750
If your wife comes with us,
I hope we'll all get
some answers.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.586
I'll just get my purse.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.633
The phones don't work
down at the precinct?

03:36.674 --> 03:38.551
I'm sorry?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.720
Well, you could've phoned
my wife and requested her
to come in.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.430
What's with the personal escort?

03:42.472 --> 03:45.141
It's a courtesy, Mr. Martin.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.310
My wife's pregnant,

03:47.352 --> 03:50.188
and she's been through
a lot these past days.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.607
This had better
be brief.

I'm not sure what to say
or how to explain,

04:29.936 --> 04:33.940

messed up this time.

Just a second.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.279
Detective Saldana.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.572
Daddy, can I spend
the weekend with Monica?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.241
Doesn't Monica live
in Connecticut?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.993
Stamford's only an hour away,
and her Mom's gonna be

04:45.034 --> 04:48.371
in the city, so she can
pick me up after school.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.749
I won't do anything wrong.
I promise.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.836
You already banned me
from seeing Erica.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.796
Can I at least have
one friend?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.840
Nobody's saying
you can't have any friends.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.092
Daddy, come on.
You know Monica's parents.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.218
They'll be there
the whole weekend.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
OK, fine.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.888
Just have the Reynolds
call me, will you?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.725
Yay, I can come.
What do I bring?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.643
SALDANA: Mr. Martin?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.270
I've just been told
our investigators

05:12.312 --> 05:14.731
would like to ask
you some questions,
as well.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.274
Why?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.443
Apparently,
the last phone call
Gemma Butler made

05:18.484 --> 05:22.071
before she went missing
was to your husband.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.577
[sirens]

05:29.620 --> 05:33.124
[phones ringing,
indistinct conversation]

05:38.671 --> 05:40.298
I understand
how important it is

05:40.340 --> 05:41.716
for you to protect
Bridget Kelly,

05:41.758 --> 05:43.468
but my priority is
finding Gemma Butler.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.719
Come on, Saldana.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.346
You can't release
Bridget's name

05:46.387 --> 05:47.638
or even a photo
to the press.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.015
Look, at this point,

05:49.057 --> 05:50.975
all I'd confirm is
that we have a suspect.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.144
If Bodaway Macawi
believes that Bridget
Kelly's right here

05:53.186 --> 05:55.355
in New York,
he'll make sure someone
takes care of her.

05:55.396 --> 05:58.232
And I wouldn't put it
past him to come here
and do it himself.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.860
Bridget Kelly's sister
is Gemma Butler's
best friend.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.278
OK, just trust me, OK?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.405
We're working toward
the same goal, right?

06:10.661 --> 06:13.247
Appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Martin.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.712
You look a little nervous.
Can I get you anything?

06:19.754 --> 06:24.425
You want some water,
coffee, aspirin?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.636
Let's just get this
over with.

06:30.723 --> 06:34.685
Mr. Martin,
do you know
who this is?

06:45.988 --> 06:48.366
Can you identify
the woman in that photo?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.040
Bridget Kelly.

Bridget Kelly.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.391
But you never actually met
Bridget Kelly?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.227
No. Siobhan just
told me about her.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.524
Her name is Bridget.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.153
How could you not tell me
that you have a twin?

07:25.194 --> 07:27.488
I didn't tell anyone.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
I'm not just anyone,
Siobhan.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.700
I'm your husband!

07:30.741 --> 07:32.743
I-I know,
and I wanted to tell you.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.579
I-I just...
<b></b>
What? It never came up?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.373
In the five years
of our marriage,

07:37.415 --> 07:38.749
you couldn't find
the right moment?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.794
JULIET: Hey, Daddy,
um, I was wondering if...

07:41.836 --> 07:43.671
Oh, sorry.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.216
I didn't realize
you two were bonding.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.593
I'll talk to you later.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.594
Wait a moment, Juliet.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.845
Andrew, please.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.598
She's our daughter.
She should know.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.394
Siobhan has a twin sister.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.438
Oh, God.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.856
There's two of them?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.649
I know this is hard
to understand,

08:03.691 --> 08:06.194
OK, but this was a part of
my life that I wanted to forget.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.905
I wanted to pretend
that she didn't exist.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.490
I know it was wrong.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.825
So w-what did she do
that was so awful?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.327
Bridget was always
in trouble.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.829
She abused drugs,
she couldn't keep a job,

08:16.871 --> 08:19.582
and I was always
cleaning up her messes.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.000
She never thought about
the consequences

08:21.042 --> 08:22.585
until it was too late.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.212
Why didn't you think you
could share this with me?

08:24.253 --> 08:26.506
It wasn't about that,
Andrew!

08:26.547 --> 08:29.050
Bridget represented a part of
my life that I thought was over.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.761
I never thought I would
see her again.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.430
Well, then why are you
telling me now?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.935
Bridget was supposed to testify
in a murder trial.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.269
She showed up
on my doorstep.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.315
I-I took her in,
but she bolted.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.150
The FBI contacted me.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.818
They think that she might

08:47.860 --> 08:51.405
somehow be involved
in Gemma's disappearance.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.615
What?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.825
I don't understand it either.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.410
But I-I didn't want you
caught off guard

08:56.452 --> 08:59.580
if the police talked to you.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.165
Please.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.584
Say something.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.339
I-I don't understand.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
Why would she hurt Gemma?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.551
She's an addict.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.677
Maybe she needed the money.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.804
I don't know.

09:14.845 --> 09:19.433
It's impossible to understand
that kind of behavior.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.272
That's all.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.864
OK, l-let's just start
from the beginning.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.284
OK? Just take me
back to The Hamptons.

Yeah. Excuse me.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.474
It's interesting.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.019
Your husband and Mr. Butler knew
exactly who Bridget Kelly was.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.439
I thought you were keeping
your sister a secret.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.816
It's hard keeping anything
a secret with you guys around.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.235
Well, you got anything else
you'd like to volunteer?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.197
My sister's not
in New York anymore.

I'm not sure what to say
or how to explain, but...

10:24.582 --> 10:28.044
I think I really
messed up this time.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.922
And I don't think there's
anything you can do to fix it.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.883
I have to leave New York.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.760
BRIDGET'S VOICE:
I was thinking maybe Europe.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.637
We always used to talk about
going there.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.432
Anyway, I, um, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

10:41.474 --> 10:43.309
and good-bye.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.436
She left it this morning.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.272
I tried calling the number back,
but it's blocked.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.067
May I?

10:55.905 --> 10:58.491
Message was left at 8:15 a.m.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.035
That's just shortly after
Detective Saldana
came to get you.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.745
So?

11:02.787 --> 11:04.580
So how can I be sure
that you weren't
helping Bridget,

11:04.622 --> 11:06.165
telling her to get
out of town?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.833
I assure you, Agent Machado,

11:07.875 --> 11:11.128
my talking to you
doesn't help my sister.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.633
What did Bridget mean by

11:15.675 --> 11:18.177
"I really messed up big
this time?"

11:20.012 --> 11:21.639
I don't know.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.225
What's your sister's
relationship to Gemma Butler?

11:24.266 --> 11:25.434
I don't know.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.727
We have evidence
connecting Bridget

11:26.769 --> 11:27.978
to Gemma's disappearance.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.355
I can put her
in the Butler home.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.564
And you have no idea
how your sister

11:30.606 --> 11:32.566
and your best friend
know each other?

11:33.984 --> 11:35.569
The only connection
that I'm aware of

11:35.611 --> 11:37.988
is a conversation
you had with Gemma
about my sister.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.366
Do you even care
that your best friend's
missing, Mrs. Martin,

11:40.408 --> 11:41.701
and that
your sister's involved?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.411
What kind of question
is that?

11:43.452 --> 11:44.829
You tell me.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.831
Lover's wife
out of the picture

11:46.872 --> 11:49.500
and troublemaker

11:49.542 --> 11:51.502
We're done here.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.139
Henry.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.307
You doing OK?

12:05.349 --> 12:08.310
I just want to go home.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.604
Car's downstairs.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.022
MACHADO: Mrs. Martin?

12:12.064 --> 12:14.400
Just one more thing.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.610
It's about Malcolm Ward.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.574
[sighs]

12:21.615 --> 12:22.950
Can I just meet you
downstairs?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.369
I'll be in the car.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.166
I know you've been in contact
with Mr. Ward.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.378
Well, he called me
a few times.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
He was concerned
about Bridget.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.215
Well, now there's reason
to be concerned about him--

12:38.257 --> 12:40.050
he's missing.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.679
Your sister calls again,
let her know.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.223
OK, I know it's
a long shot, but...

12:46.265 --> 12:49.435
that news might get her
to come back and testify.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.936
Bodaway was looking
for Bridget,

12:50.978 --> 12:52.188
and he thought Malcolm
had the answer.

12:52.229 --> 12:56.192
And if he didn't...

12:56.233 --> 12:59.028
You think he might...
be dead?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.572
Well, I honestly don't know.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.075
All I know is
there were signs
of foul play.

Huh? Huh?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.727
He's still breathing.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.324
I got to take a leak, man,

All right.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.787
We'll be at the spot soon.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.926

He's high.

about your sister.

Questions
I couldn't answer.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.169
Who's Malcolm Ward?

Malcolm is my sister's

I didn't.
It's not my birthday.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.363
You're three months sober.
That deserves a wish.

16:29.405 --> 16:33.158
Then I wish to keep this up
for a very long time.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.410
You will.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.120

another wish?

an addict.

17:37.306 --> 17:41.393
How bad was it,
your sister's
drug problem?

17:41.435 --> 17:44.021
There were times
I didn't think
she'd make it through.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.399
I read about Bridget online.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.942
She witnessed
her friend

17:48.984 --> 17:52.362
being strangled
in a strip club.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.990

Is Juliet safe?

She left the country.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.752
So she says.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.379
You haven't seen her
in what, six years?

18:12.424 --> 18:14.384
She's an addict,

18:14.426 --> 18:16.929

18:16.970 --> 18:19.640
How do you know
she's telling the truth?

18:19.681 --> 18:22.101
You said yourself
that you didn't
understand

18:22.142 --> 18:24.269
the way she was
behaving.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.396
I'm not sure you really know
what she's capable of.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.107
She's gone.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.525
What difference
does it make?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.527
She can't hurt us
anymore.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.950
Doesn't forgive the fact
that you weren't honest with me.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.079
What about our,
uh, promise?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.914
No more secrets.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.333
I told you the truth.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.585
Only because you had to.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.841
I'm going to
call Juliet.

I'm starting to regret letting
her go away for the weekend.

Just say it.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.567
Say what?

19:11.608 --> 19:14.236
It was a mistake.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.655
It was a mistake.

19:20.909 --> 19:24.121
You know how I feel
about you, right?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.540
But we crossed

she just got fed up

she went to the spa gone?

is Gemma Butler.

He didn't.

And I know that the cops
are chasing the wrong suspect.

Oh.

at the evidence.

and you are
her twin sister.

I took a peek
into the case file.

Another question is,
where's Gemma's car?

Henry Butler
didn't seem to know.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.278
You think there might be
a clue in the car?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.696
It could be.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.031
Maybe somebody
tried to hide it.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.574
Maybe that's where
the attack started.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.992
Car could lead
to something.

25:25.649 --> 25:29.027
You didn't.
And you're welcome.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.322
[chuckles]

25:32.364 --> 25:34.741
[loud dance music playing]

25:38.995 --> 25:40.956
Hey!

25:40.997 --> 25:44.376
[talking, laughing]

25:51.883 --> 25:52.842
Let it out.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.513
[retching, coughing]

25:56.555 --> 25:58.515
OK. Let's...
let's get out of here.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.475
I don't think I can walk.

Let me just get you outside,

26:00.517 --> 26:02.227
and then we'll get
a cab back to my place.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.853
OK?
No, I have to get home.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.647
I have to get there
before my Dad gets back.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.108
Monica, you're drunk.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.859
You can't drive.
No.

26:09.901 --> 26:12.862
It's OK. I'll just walk
it off for a little while.

26:15.782 --> 26:17.492
We should just
go back to my place,

26:17.534 --> 26:18.994
and I'll have
my dad's driver

26:19.035 --> 26:21.413
take us back to
your apartment, OK?

26:21.454 --> 26:22.914
Juliet, are you thick?

26:22.956 --> 26:25.792
No. My parents
are gonna kill me.

26:25.834 --> 26:29.212
I have to take the car
home that I came in.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.463
I know.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.257
[laughter]

26:32.299 --> 26:34.467
I'll get you home.
It's all right.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.436
ANDREW: Gemma's opening's
about to start.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.647
Ready to go?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.899
Are you sure
you want to?

26:49.941 --> 26:51.443
You still seem upset.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.028
I'll be fine.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.198
I didn't tell you
about Bridget because...

26:57.240 --> 26:58.992
I was ashamed.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.411
It sucks to feel that way
about your family.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.081
You don't have to feel ashamed.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.292
It's not like you did
those things.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.800
It's different with twins.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.510
I don't know how
to explain it.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.640
I always felt
responsible for Bridget.

27:23.975 --> 27:28.605
I guess I was afraid
that if I told you
the truth,

27:28.647 --> 27:32.400
that it would
change the way
you felt about me.

27:32.442 --> 27:36.237
Can't you give me
a little more credit?

27:36.279 --> 27:38.948
I should've.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.951
I'm sorry, it...

27:41.993 --> 27:45.163
I know it's wrong,
it's just...

27:45.205 --> 27:49.000
sometimes
it's easier to lie.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.837
You know what
I mean.

27:52.879 --> 27:56.966
Andrew, no one
tells the truth
100% of the time.

27:58.885 --> 28:04.224
Being honest...
it makes you
vulnerable.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.601
And that's scary.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.355
I'm sure there
are things that

28:10.397 --> 28:13.024
you're not
100% honest
with me about.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.239
I'd be lying if
I said otherwise.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.451
Well, you don't
have to.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.453
I promise you,
I'll never judge.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.455
What? Even if
they're awful?

28:27.497 --> 28:30.250
Hmm...yeah.

28:33.253 --> 28:36.214
When I found out
you were pregnant...

28:38.800 --> 28:40.760
I wasn't happy.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.013
Really?

28:44.055 --> 28:45.640
We weren't in a good place.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.644
We weren't speaking,
barely having sex anymore,

28:49.686 --> 28:54.065
and getting pregnant seemed
like a complication.

28:56.776 --> 29:01.573
But I realize now
that it was a blessing.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.035
This baby means
everything to me,

29:06.077 --> 29:09.247
and that's why
the lies hurt.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.502
I just don't want...

29:14.544 --> 29:17.505
anything to go wrong
ever again between us.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.384
I don't either.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.514
I've lost
too much already.

29:26.556 --> 29:31.144
I...I don't want
to lose you, too.

Yes, Mr. Carpenter,
I know who you are.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.317
You're Juliet's
English teacher.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.860
Listen, um...

30:20.902 --> 30:22.904
I'm calling about Juliet.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.739
Why? What's wrong?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.951
She's been in a car accident.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.250
ANDREW: Mr. Carpenter,
where's my child?
Where's Juliet?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.085
She's with Monica. But please,
Mr. Martin, calm down.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.878
Juliet's fine.
<b></b>
You're telling me
to calm down

30:38.920 --> 30:40.880
after my child's
been in a car accident?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.590
The cops said that
they'd been drinking,

30:42.632 --> 30:44.133
that it's a miracle
they're unharmed,

30:44.175 --> 30:45.510
and I should stay calm?

30:45.552 --> 30:46.928
I'm just trying to
put this in perspective.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.638
What are you
even doing here?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.265
No-No offense, you've
been her teacher,
what, a week?

30:50.306 --> 30:51.683
She called me.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.936
Said it was
an emergency.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.565
But just so you know, I called
you as soon as I got here.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.236
I'm gonna go.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.322
If you need anything else...

No, we're good.

31:12.704 --> 31:13.746
Juliet.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.915
Oh, my God.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.792
Are you OK?
<b></b>
I'm OK, Dad.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.378
Are you sure you're not...
<b></b>
I'm fine, really.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.257
I don't understand.
Why were you driving?

31:24.299 --> 31:26.134
You only have
a learner's permit.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.261
What were you even
doing in the city?

31:28.303 --> 31:30.054
I spoke with Mrs. Reynolds,
and she told me

31:30.096 --> 31:32.807
that you two would be
in Stamford all weekend.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.602
There-There was
a change of plans.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.438
It wasn't a big deal.
<b></b>
Not a big deal?

31:38.479 --> 31:40.023
You were drinking
and driving.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.232
I had two beers.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.734
It's not like I
was doing coke!

31:42.775 --> 31:44.193
Oh, well, in that case...

31:44.235 --> 31:46.029
Dad...

31:46.070 --> 31:48.615
I-I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.700
Monica was
totally trashed.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.784
She needed to
get her car home.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.913
I-I was just trying
to help, OK?

31:54.954 --> 31:56.956
Well, you were very helpful...
so helpful, in fact,

31:56.998 --> 31:58.499
you almost got
the both of you killed!

31:58.541 --> 32:01.252
This is exactly why
I called Mr. C!

32:01.294 --> 32:04.047
All you ever do
is get pissed off!

32:04.088 --> 32:06.382
I have every right
to be pissed off.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.217
Between the drugs
and the fighting

32:08.259 --> 32:10.261
and the getting
thrown out of school...

32:11.721 --> 32:14.349
But this time, Juliet...

32:14.390 --> 32:16.059
I'm done.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.477
What are you gonna do?

32:17.518 --> 32:19.270
Put me up for adoption?

32:19.312 --> 32:22.482
No. No, 'cause I know
you'd actually enjoy that.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.694
I'm taking away
your trust fund.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.072
No credit cards,
no allowance.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.907
What?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.117
It's the only way to get
through to you, Juliet.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.079
Until you can
start to prove

32:36.120 --> 32:37.747
that you're getting
back on track,

32:37.789 --> 32:42.418
really trying to
get back on track...

32:42.460 --> 32:44.253
you're cut off.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.424
Now I'm going to talk
to Monica's father.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.514
I'm sorry, Juliet.

32:54.555 --> 32:58.434
You owe me, bitch...
like, $10 million.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.269
What?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.233
You're a lucky man.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.442
You found Bridget.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.887
but Andrew needs
to stay with her.

34:19.140 --> 34:20.558
You should move away
from the window.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.477
Why?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.520
I'm here to celebrate
my wife's work.

Not enough.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.872

to you, Siobhan.

I should've made more
of an effort with Gemma.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.966
You didn't know.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.928

disappear?

bag to even say
what I'm thinking.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.731
That you didn't know
how much you loved her
until you couldn't tell her?

someone to help.

Then don't fight it,
please?

37:57.149 --> 37:59.110
Do as the doctor says.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.282
This is our baby.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.300
I found Gemma's car.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.844
SIOBHAN:
Was there anything left behind?

39:06.886 --> 39:08.471
Just some blood.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.103
Her blood?

39:16.145 --> 39:18.898
CHARLIE: No, mine,
from when she hit me.

39:18.939 --> 39:20.524
Thank God you found it.

39:20.566 --> 39:22.234
CHARLIE: Thank Bridget.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.528
She's still the only suspect
in Gemma's disappearance.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.655
They'll never connect it to me.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.866
And everyone still thinks
Bridget is me?

39:28.908 --> 39:30.826
CHARLIE: Don't worry, Siobhan.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.828
Gemma never got a chance
to tell anyone.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.748
Gemma Butler?

39:41.170 --> 39:42.546
Agh!

39:58.604 --> 40:01.065
Ohh!

40:01.107 --> 40:03.275
[panting]

40:11.575 --> 40:14.578
CHARLIE: Call me
with the next move.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.831
[airliner flying]
