WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:03.416
[theme music playing]

01:06.625 --> 01:09.000
You slime-sucking dirtbag.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.250
You've got a lot of guts
coming up here, Sabretooth.

01:12.250 --> 01:16.333
That's no way to greet
your old partner, runt,

01:16.333 --> 01:19.166
after all we've been through.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.708
Logan. He's crazy.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.375
What's wrong, punk?

01:28.125 --> 01:31.208
Ah. Can't take care
of your woman?

01:31.208 --> 01:32.875
[growling]

01:32.875 --> 01:36.375
You're gonna pay
for hurting her, Creed.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.333
[screaming]

01:38.333 --> 01:41.000
The nightmares and delusions
are getting worse!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.458
We've got to do
something for him!

01:43.458 --> 01:46.583
All I have done
to help him has collapsed.

01:47.083 --> 01:50.125
Strange, tortuous memories

01:50.125 --> 01:53.291
pouring out,
as if a dam had burst.

01:53.291 --> 01:56.333
I... [screaming]

01:56.333 --> 01:57.375
Professor!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.583
Wolverine!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.291
You're mine.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.875
[Wolverine] Sabretooth!

02:12.458 --> 02:16.750
Logan, stop. It's Jean! Logan!

02:16.750 --> 02:19.166
-Check on Scott.
-Be careful, Hank.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.833
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.458
Logan. Logan!

02:27.958 --> 02:30.583
Stop! Logan!

02:32.333 --> 02:35.208
I fear for what you may do.

02:50.125 --> 02:54.291
Hank? I found this
inside an envelope
postmarked two weeks ago.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.708
There was no return address.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.291
I've seen this image
in his mind.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.458
This must be a clue
to his delusions!

03:01.458 --> 03:03.458
Maybe it triggered them.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.208
But what about the back
of the picture?

03:05.208 --> 03:06.875
I'm sure
that's where he's gone.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.000
[Beast] Most intriguing.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.291
These coordinates
are in southern Canada.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.583
Go after him, Hank.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.375
I shall leave at once.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.875
I just pray
Wolverine is better prepared

03:17.875 --> 03:20.500
for whatever
is waiting for him than I.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.875
Somehow, I ain't surprised.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.416
[groaning]

03:51.083 --> 03:54.000
Who's messing with my head?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.458
[Professor] Is he damaged?

03:55.458 --> 03:56.583
[man, on intercom]
Nothing serious.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.458
[Professor] Then begin
the adamantium feed.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.458
[man, on intercom]
Feed initiated. Steady.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.458
Cardiotach higher
than expected.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.833
[muffled screaming]

04:08.833 --> 04:10.583
Extraordinary.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.583
We hope to make use
of your gift.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.000
No!

04:20.583 --> 04:22.750
Security! Help me!

04:28.583 --> 04:31.750
Wolverine, I... It's Hank!

04:36.208 --> 04:38.416
Wake up! You're having
one of your delusions!

04:39.250 --> 04:41.458
[screaming]

04:43.291 --> 04:45.416
Hank, I don't know what...

04:45.416 --> 04:48.500
Calm yourself! I have come
to take you home.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.583
-Get out of here.
-I will not leave--

04:50.583 --> 04:52.208
I said get out of here!

04:52.208 --> 04:54.000
You shouldn't have followed me.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.250
I'm going nuts!

04:55.250 --> 04:57.208
I cannot let you
face this alone.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.000
You must tell me
what is going on!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.708
I don't know!

05:00.708 --> 05:02.625
I've got to figure this out!

05:02.625 --> 05:05.208
I don't want to hurt
anyone else.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.708
Now, something
is drawing me back.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.000
[Beast] Do you know this place?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.083
I got my bones here.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.250
I got to find out why.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.500
Perhaps not as satisfying,
but effective nonetheless.

05:29.708 --> 05:33.333
No! [groaning]

05:56.000 --> 05:57.458
[screaming]

06:00.458 --> 06:02.375
Subject taking direction well.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.458
Increase programing.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.500
Logan, can you hear me?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.875
[groaning]

06:08.875 --> 06:11.708
Yeah. What's wrong?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.083
You just went
into a dream state again.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.208
What did you see?

06:15.583 --> 06:19.708
Me... being trained
to take people out.

06:20.416 --> 06:22.250
Our Lotus!

06:22.250 --> 06:24.583
[Beast]
The car in the photograph.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.583
Silver Fox.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.500
[tires screeching]

07:03.375 --> 07:05.833
[shouting]

07:08.500 --> 07:10.875
[Sabretooth]
What's wrong, punk?

07:14.333 --> 07:16.875
Ah! Can't take care
of your woman?

07:16.875 --> 07:18.500
[shouting]

07:18.500 --> 07:20.833
I should have known.

07:20.833 --> 07:24.375
Why drag me
all the way here, runt?

07:24.375 --> 07:26.458
I could've
sliced you up stateside!

07:27.708 --> 07:29.166
[growling]

07:29.166 --> 07:32.583
You're gonna pay
for hurting her, Creed!

07:32.583 --> 07:35.833
-You sent me that photo!
-[Sabretooth] What photo?

07:35.833 --> 07:37.583
You little weasel!

07:41.125 --> 07:42.291
[groaning]

07:44.166 --> 07:46.833
You can't face me man-to-man!

07:47.125 --> 07:50.625
So you get cue ball Xavier
to mess with my head!

07:50.625 --> 07:53.333
I fight my own battles!

07:53.333 --> 07:56.458
You taught me that you can't
count on your friends!

07:56.458 --> 07:59.500
I saved both our lives, you...

07:59.500 --> 08:01.625
[both screaming]

08:02.375 --> 08:03.625
We've got the C-synth!

08:03.625 --> 08:05.000
[Sabretooth] Move it, runt!

08:05.000 --> 08:07.416
[Wolverine] Come on, Fox!
Let's go!

08:11.708 --> 08:12.750
Head for the door!

08:18.833 --> 08:20.708
Come on, Fox! Run for it!

08:20.708 --> 08:22.083
We'll cover you!

08:26.583 --> 08:29.208
Forget it, kid!
They're expendable!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.458
No!

08:31.458 --> 08:33.625
No!

08:34.083 --> 08:35.583
Easy, Logan.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.708
Fox, Maverick.
You left them to die!

08:41.708 --> 08:43.250
So what?

08:43.250 --> 08:45.166
-Traitor!
-Coward!

08:53.458 --> 08:55.583
[Wolverine]
Say good night, Creed!

08:56.458 --> 08:57.458
[groans]

08:59.416 --> 09:04.291
[Wolverine] Silver Fox,
Maverick, you're alive!

09:06.625 --> 09:09.416
That was only
a level three blast, gentlemen.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.583
Believe me, there's nothing
I'd rather do than finish
both of you right now,

09:13.583 --> 09:16.458
but unfortunately
that's not an option.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.291
You better do
some fast talking!

09:19.291 --> 09:22.583
Save it, Creed!
I'm not in the mood.

09:22.583 --> 09:26.125
The only reason you're still
breathing is so we can
get some answers.

09:26.125 --> 09:29.250
It's good to be needed,
eh, Logan?

09:29.250 --> 09:31.458
[Silver Fox]
I hope you enjoyed the photo.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.708
I assume you've been having
headaches and nightmares
like Maverick and I.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.083
They did something to our minds
when we worked here,

09:37.083 --> 09:39.250
something code-named "Talos."

09:39.250 --> 09:41.875
Our pain's not gonna stop
until we figure all this out.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.333
So let's try to keep
from eviscerating each other

09:44.333 --> 09:46.000
until we get the job done.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.708
Welcome, gentlemen.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.625
Welcome to our past.

09:57.875 --> 10:00.708
What is this, Fox?
Hoser Hollywood?

10:00.708 --> 10:02.833
Take a closer look, Logan.

10:06.291 --> 10:09.291
You remember these places,
don't you?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.583
[Beast] Created memories.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.333
But to what purpose?

10:18.166 --> 10:20.500
[screaming]

10:28.166 --> 10:30.000
[growling]

10:42.125 --> 10:44.208
[Wolverine]
That's not how it happened!

10:44.208 --> 10:47.083
I wasn't kidnapped
in a parking lot!

10:47.083 --> 10:49.083
[screaming]

10:50.958 --> 10:52.708
What happened?

10:52.708 --> 10:56.583
Hairy little fireplug
can't take it.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.583
What the...
But... that's... home.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.083
[screaming]

11:05.125 --> 11:09.208
[Professor]
He's no son of mine.
He's some kind of animal.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.125
He's full of wickedness.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.583
That's what it is.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.083
But don't you worry, boy.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.583
Jebediah Creed knows how to get
the wickedness out of you!

11:18.583 --> 11:22.375
No, please!
Please, Pa, not again!

11:22.375 --> 11:24.208
I'll be good!

11:24.208 --> 11:25.750
[crying] I'll be good.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.875
[screaming]

11:29.500 --> 11:33.416
No! Creed! Stop him!

11:33.416 --> 11:36.000
Somebody stop him!

11:36.000 --> 11:37.458
This is nuts.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.708
Why would somebody want us
to remember this

11:39.708 --> 11:41.000
like it was all terrible?

11:43.125 --> 11:45.166
Fox, you OK?

11:45.166 --> 11:46.375
Don't touch me!

11:47.291 --> 11:50.958
The cabin. Was that a lie, too?

11:51.458 --> 11:54.000
Fox, what's going on?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.250
[Beast, on mic] I think
I may have found your answer.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.833
I have located records,
a video journal

11:58.833 --> 12:00.583
of the experiments
carried out here.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.208
Direct your attention
to the overhead screens.

12:04.125 --> 12:08.250
Despite initial setbacks,
all subjects are responding
to the trauma conditioning.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.416
We will be able
to reintegrate them
into society

12:10.416 --> 12:12.750
with no memory
that we conditioned them.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.500
When their covert
services are needed,

12:15.500 --> 12:18.291
they will attack their target
and then remember nothing.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.083
The key is to reach
the subconscious mind.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.875
The subjects must
be repeatedly exposed

12:23.875 --> 12:26.875
to a simulation
of extreme emotional trauma.

12:26.875 --> 12:29.208
While using
psychoactive chemicals,

12:29.208 --> 12:31.625
we flood the subjects' minds
with false memories.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.708
Overwhelming them.
Breaking them down.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.208
Making them controllable.

12:37.708 --> 12:42.291
The process seems to work best
when based on
actual life events.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.750
"A lie which is half a truth

12:44.750 --> 12:48.125
is ever the blackest of lies."
Tennyson.

12:48.458 --> 12:53.458
There's your answer, Fox.
It's all a load of garbage!

12:53.458 --> 12:57.083
Our memories are some
chrome dome's science project.

12:57.083 --> 13:01.000
Let's find the jerk and do some
traumatizing of our own!

13:01.000 --> 13:04.083
One moment, Sabretooth.
There's more.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.583
The remarkable tissue
regeneration in the subjects

13:08.583 --> 13:13.208
code named Wolverine
and Sabretooth,
appears to be genetic.

13:13.208 --> 13:16.583
We believe this healing factor
may enable subjects

13:16.583 --> 13:19.333
to survive the adamantium
bonding process

13:19.333 --> 13:21.416
theorized by Professor Oyama.

13:21.416 --> 13:24.333
We will try the process
on Wolverine first,

13:24.333 --> 13:27.000
then if successful,
on Sabretooth.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.583
Well, what do you know.
If the runt hadn't
trashed the place,

13:31.583 --> 13:34.750
I could've had
tin-plated bones, too!

13:34.750 --> 13:36.083
You ought to thank me.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.583
That is the final tape.

13:56.750 --> 14:00.375
I've checked this place out,
but there's one chamber
I can't get into.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.583
That's why I sent for you.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.125
Hmm.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.250
Adamantium?

14:12.250 --> 14:13.500
I held a cutting laser on it

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
for over an hour.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.583
This is all it did.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.125
The thing's got
some sort of DNA lock on it.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.750
This is the only way in.

14:22.291 --> 14:25.375
Four panels, four of us.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.500
The answers have
got to be in there!

14:27.500 --> 14:30.500
Your hypothesis
appears correct, Ms. Fox.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.000
-It is a genetic scanner,
but I fail to--
-Can it, fuzzball!

14:38.458 --> 14:39.875
Let's do it!

14:42.416 --> 14:44.083
Something is wrong here.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.833
If they were trying to hide
the truth from you,

14:46.833 --> 14:50.875
why would they place it
behind a door only
the four of you could open?

14:50.875 --> 14:53.458
This whole deal is rotten,
Hank.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.416
But whatever's in there,
I got to know.

15:03.708 --> 15:07.250
[Sabretooth] Nothing!
Not a blasted thing!

15:08.708 --> 15:09.958
Look!

15:10.875 --> 15:14.875
Welcome. I cannot say
I'm happy you four are here.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.708
Your presence indicates
that you've discovered

15:16.708 --> 15:19.291
the truth about
your memory therapy.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.625
Conditioning has failed.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.333
When you opened the door,
a failsafe program
was activated,

15:24.333 --> 15:26.208
code named "Talos,"

15:26.208 --> 15:28.250
which will see to your capture
and reprogramming.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.583
Uncontrolled with your
true memories returning,

15:30.583 --> 15:32.500
you are a threat
to our operations.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.625
Mmm. Looks like we'll get
a little action this trip
after all.

15:36.625 --> 15:39.291
Hold it, Creed! Let's find out
what we're up against!

15:39.291 --> 15:41.083
Maverick, scan the area!

15:41.375 --> 15:43.375
Blue Boy, get those doors open.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.875
My name is Mr. McCoy, madam.
Not Blue Boy.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.583
I am Talos.
You are to be reprogrammed.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.291
If you resist,
I will terminate you.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.458
Another tin can
with an attitude.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.000
Maverick,
give Sabretooth a blaster.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You got it.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Keep the robot busy

16:03.000 --> 16:04.458
while Wolverine attacks.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.416
Unit in capture mode!

16:07.416 --> 16:10.708
If you tough guys have a plan,
this would be
a real good time to use it!

16:14.458 --> 16:16.500
Weaponry at stun level.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.333
Stun, huh?
Sorry, pal, I play for keeps!

16:20.875 --> 16:23.166
[Maverick] Power source
is buried pretty deep.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.333
We have to get a thermite
grenade right next to it,
inside the armor.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.583
I'll dig the hole,
you plant the seed.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.000
Unit structurally Zcompromised.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.166
[groans]

16:40.166 --> 16:41.458
End capture mode.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.208
[Professor]
He's no son of mine.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.000
[screaming]

16:57.250 --> 16:58.708
Thanks, Mr. McCoy.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.708
Now, Maverick! Do it!

17:14.708 --> 17:16.291
Fire in the hole!

17:22.833 --> 17:24.000
Maverick!

17:27.708 --> 17:29.208
Nice suit.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.416
Thanks.
I'll refer you to my tailor.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.166
[Wolverine]
How's that door coming, Hank?

17:35.166 --> 17:36.416
[Beast] I believe I...

17:36.958 --> 17:38.125
Ah.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.458
[Sabretooth] Well, looky here!

17:41.458 --> 17:44.416
I got me a new ashtray!

17:44.416 --> 17:47.166
Structural integrity
severely compromised.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.875
Activating mnemonic
trauma triggers.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.125
[groaning]

17:52.125 --> 17:53.833
My word!

17:53.833 --> 17:56.000
[Talos] Primary attack unit
now disabled!

17:56.000 --> 17:58.250
Activating secondary
attack unit.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.291
This could be a problem.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.000
[engine starting]

18:22.125 --> 18:24.583
I am Talos.
You are to be terminated.

18:26.750 --> 18:27.875
[Beast] Catch!

18:45.833 --> 18:46.875
Oh, dear.

18:55.875 --> 18:59.083
These pyrotechnics are bound
to attract unwanted attention.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.375
I suggest we beat
a hasty retreat.

19:01.375 --> 19:02.833
I shall prepare the mini jet.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.625
So long, Logan.
It was good to see you.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.708
Yeah, me, too.

19:10.083 --> 19:14.458
Fox, I... I don't know
what they did to us,
to our memories.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.333
But some of you and me
must have been true.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.208
You remember the cabin.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.875
I carved our names
in that door.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.291
Don't you get it, Logan?

19:24.291 --> 19:26.500
It was all made up!

19:26.500 --> 19:30.875
The fake cabin in there
didn't have any names
on the door.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.166
Ours did. It happened, Fox.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.958
We happened.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.708
Perhaps.
But that was another lifetime.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.708
Goodbye, Logan.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.166
[beeps]

19:56.250 --> 19:59.000
Mini jet's ready.
Where's Sabretooth?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.875
Don't know and don't care.

20:01.583 --> 20:05.000
Whatever his reasons were,
he saved my skin back there.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.291
I think we've both
had enough for one day.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.291
What does it all mean, Hank?

20:10.291 --> 20:15.083
I came here to find answers,
and now I know
less than I did before.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.750
I can't even trust
my own memories.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.708
I have no simple solution
for you, Logan.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.750
Professor Xavier
has helped you in the past.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.583
He and the other X-Men
are there for you now.

20:27.333 --> 20:31.625
Those are real memories,
ones I know you can trust.

20:35.625 --> 20:39.166
Come on now. Let's go home.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.875
