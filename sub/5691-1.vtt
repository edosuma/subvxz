WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:10.777
Who shot Jerry and Marilyn?

00:10.810 --> 00:12.913
Alstory Simon.

00:12.946 --> 00:17.150
Did you know a man named
Anthony Porter or Tony Porter?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.952
No, I don't.

00:18.986 --> 00:23.790
Why didn't you tell the,
uh, investigator what you knew

00:23.823 --> 00:26.259
about the killing of these people

00:26.293 --> 00:28.595
given that he had told you
that an innocent man

00:28.628 --> 00:30.230
was about to be executed?

00:34.734 --> 00:37.404
Anthony Porter was
the trigger of all of this.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.739
How does an innocent man
sit on death row

00:39.772 --> 00:43.343
for 15 years and gets no relief?

00:43.376 --> 00:46.713
Except for the students of journalism

00:46.746 --> 00:48.548
at Northwestern University.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.417
How the hell does that happen?

00:50.450 --> 00:52.285
In America that happened.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.555
Wasn't China, wasn't Korea.

00:55.588 --> 00:59.026
It was in the greatest country
in the world, America.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.493
If it hadn't been for the students

01:00.527 --> 01:03.463
at Northwestern University,
he'd be dead and buried.

01:22.515 --> 01:25.118
In 1983, Anthony Porter

01:25.152 --> 01:27.620
was sentenced to death
for the murders of teenagers

01:27.654 --> 01:30.057
Jerry Hillard and Marilyn Green

01:30.090 --> 01:31.758
at the Washington Park swimming pool

01:31.791 --> 01:33.994
on Chicago's South Side.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.769
Anthony Porter's 1999 release

01:42.802 --> 01:44.737
was the 10th death row exoneration

01:44.771 --> 01:48.841
since capital punishment
was reinstated in 1977.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.710
Allegations of police brutality

01:50.743 --> 01:54.147
and coerced confessions
were now commonplace.

01:54.181 --> 01:57.250
The "Chicago Tribune"
published a multi-part series

01:57.284 --> 01:59.719
focusing on these botched convictions

01:59.752 --> 02:02.222
malicious prosecutions and the lawsuits

02:02.255 --> 02:05.525
and massive financial awards
that followed.

02:05.558 --> 02:08.461
Nearly every phase
of the criminal justice system

02:08.495 --> 02:11.498
now operated under a cloud of suspicion.

02:13.266 --> 02:16.303
To free a wrongfully convicted man

02:16.336 --> 02:18.871
who had spent 15 years behind bars

02:18.905 --> 02:21.208
for a double homicide he did not commit

02:21.241 --> 02:24.211
and was 48 hours
away from being executed

02:24.244 --> 02:28.248
has got to be the great dream

02:28.281 --> 02:31.584
of any reporter anywhere.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.086
I don't know that you could contrive

02:33.120 --> 02:35.622
a story more wonderful than that.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.725
No, I'm frankly outraged that
the state was willing, ready

02:38.758 --> 02:40.560
and able to execute an innocent man.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.729
And if it had not been for
his attorneys getting a stay

02:42.762 --> 02:45.365
on September 21st, my students and I

02:45.398 --> 02:47.834
would not have had
the opportunity to free him.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.737
David Protess
was a Northwestern University

02:50.770 --> 02:52.939
journalism professor, author,

02:52.972 --> 02:55.642
and leader of the school's
Innocence Project.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.545
I had the opportunity
to take David Protess'

02:58.578 --> 03:00.513
investigative journalism class.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.950
And I ended up working
on the case of Anthony Porter.

03:03.983 --> 03:07.554
Anthony had come
within 50 hours of execution

03:07.587 --> 03:10.090
exactly a week before we started class.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.698
He received a stay at the last minute.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.200
But he didn't receive a stay because

03:20.233 --> 03:22.001
anyone thought he was innocent.

03:22.035 --> 03:26.039
He received a stay because
his IQ had been tested at 51

03:26.073 --> 03:27.407
and there were questions about whether

03:27.440 --> 03:29.509
he was competent to be executed.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.812
We went and we reenacted the crime.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.715
And we found out that
the eyewitness who said

03:35.748 --> 03:38.017
he had seen Anthony Porter
committing the crime

03:38.051 --> 03:39.519
couldn't have seen it at all.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.689
That witness recanted his testimony.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.628
And the case against Mr.
Porter began to fall apart.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.030
The students teamed up
with a private investigator.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.134
A fellow by the name of Paul Ciolino.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.736
Then we tracked down
the ex-wife of the person

03:56.769 --> 03:58.271
we thought was the real killer.

03:58.305 --> 04:01.774
And she told us on video
that she had been there

04:01.808 --> 04:03.610
when her husband committed the crime.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.085
The betrayal led to a man

04:12.119 --> 04:15.155
named Alstory Simon in Milwaukee.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.957
A private investigator obtained
a videotape confession

04:17.990 --> 04:20.493
from Simon that he and not Mr. Porter

04:20.527 --> 04:23.996
had killed the couple in the
park in Chicago in 1982.

04:29.302 --> 04:33.906
And Anthony was released on
the state's motion 2 days later.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.584
I'm absolutely thrilled and ecstatic

04:44.617 --> 04:46.419
that an innocent man
is gonna be walking to freedom.

04:46.453 --> 04:51.658
And having played some role in that
just makes me feel exhilarated.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.361
As far as the media was
concerned, they were heroes.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.230
They spared the innocent guy from death

04:57.264 --> 05:00.833
and it was a huge story
in Chicago and nationally.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.536
On the issue of capital punishment.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.772
One of the people is Anthony Porter.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.740
He spent 16 years on death row

05:07.774 --> 05:10.243
he was within 2 days of being executed.

05:10.277 --> 05:14.681
In 1996, Protess freed
4 convicted murderers.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.549
2 of them from death row.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.952
In a case known as
"The Ford Heights Four."

05:19.986 --> 05:22.489
People began to jokingly say
that my home telephone number

05:22.522 --> 05:25.658
is on every prison cellblock
wall in America.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.660
The Anthony Porter case
was pivotal moment

05:27.694 --> 05:29.396
in the abolition of
the death penalty in Illinois.

05:29.429 --> 05:33.132
It was the case that
widely reported to have moved

05:33.166 --> 05:35.868
Governor Ryan from his being
on the fence

05:35.902 --> 05:37.437
about the death penalty to being

05:37.470 --> 05:39.939
actively very concerned
about its administration.

05:39.972 --> 05:44.076
I'm commuting the sentence
of all death row inmates.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.646
167 of them.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.014
Everything that I have believed in

05:48.047 --> 05:50.517
about the criminal justice system

05:50.550 --> 05:51.951
was now coming into question

05:51.984 --> 05:55.422
with the botched conviction
of Mr. Porter.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.590
You can sort of draw
almost a direct line

05:57.624 --> 06:01.127
from the shock
that Governor Ryan felt about

06:01.160 --> 06:02.729
what almost happened to Anthony Porter

06:02.762 --> 06:06.866
to the abolition of the death
penalty nearly a decade later.

06:06.899 --> 06:11.838
My first reaction was, "Oh, my God!"

06:11.871 --> 06:17.244
"Don't tell me we almost
put an innocent man to death."

06:17.277 --> 06:20.813
It was the most emotional time
in my life.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.316
I saw it on the news.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.184
Governor Ryan was on there and he said

06:25.218 --> 06:28.521
"Come on up here, little buddy"
and it was Anthony Porter.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.324
And then the governor
was explaining the fine work

06:31.358 --> 06:35.962
of this journalism class
and I was amazed.

06:35.995 --> 06:40.900
I was confused and actually
I got depressed over it.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.202
What did I do wrong?

06:43.236 --> 06:48.308
I prided myself in conducting

06:48.341 --> 06:50.577
good investigations.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.313
It... it just blew me away.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.315
Richard Devine was the state's attorney

06:55.348 --> 06:56.883
of Cook County, Illinois.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.950
Once again

06:57.984 --> 06:59.452
in the crosshairs of the media

06:59.486 --> 07:01.321
and wrongful conviction movement

07:01.354 --> 07:03.523
he ordered a grand jury investigation

07:03.556 --> 07:05.592
into the 1982 murders.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.760
We should get these
allegations in court.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.330
Assistant State's Attorney Thomas Gainer

07:10.363 --> 07:13.099
led the grand jury
investigation to find out

07:13.132 --> 07:16.035
who really killed Jerry and Marilyn.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.637
The state's attorney's office
took testimony

07:17.670 --> 07:19.372
from witnesses who were
in the park at the time

07:19.406 --> 07:21.774
of the shooting and also David Protess

07:21.808 --> 07:24.577
his students and
investigator, Paul Ciolino.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.646
After the conclusion
of the grand jury proceedings

07:26.679 --> 07:28.948
Anthony Porter's conviction was vacated.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.484
He was a free man.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.821
Through the Northwestern
investigation, the guilty guy

07:34.854 --> 07:38.024
Alstory Simon was put in
prison and the innocent guy

07:38.057 --> 07:40.493
Anthony Porter was released.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.395
There was one problem though,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.731
Anthony Porter killed those 2 people.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.900
It was one big lie.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.842
The thing I remember about
Anthony Porter being released in 1999

07:55.875 --> 07:58.010
was the hug picture.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.847
It was enough to make my blood boil.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.318
This case had a motive behind
it bigger than the crime.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.054
They did it, they killed
the death penalty.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.989
On the wrong case.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.991
Anthony Porter's
going back to court today.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.326
He's planning to file a suit against

08:13.360 --> 08:15.261
8 Chicago police officers.

08:15.294 --> 08:20.333
My reaction to the announcement
of that lawsuit was... I was livid.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.135
I was furious. I was insulted.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.638
I just couldn't believe
that it was happening.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.841
When you get sued like that,
you have to go in

08:28.875 --> 08:31.143
and list all your assets.

08:31.177 --> 08:37.784
I can lose... everything
that I'd worked for, over what?

08:37.817 --> 08:41.520
Porter's contention,
according to the lawsuit was

08:41.554 --> 08:43.823
uh, that we manufactured the case.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.494
They railroaded him.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.870
This was the first time in
the 17 years since his arrest

08:57.904 --> 09:01.273
that Porter said
he was tortured by police.

09:01.307 --> 09:08.247
To be accused of being racist by
the lawsuit, that made me angry.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.016
That ain't me.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.751
We're professionals.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.886
We didn't operate that way.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.556
And I knew that he had
no business suing me

09:16.589 --> 09:18.591
because I had not done anything wrong.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.027
Nor had any of
the other police officers.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.431
Northwestern had a real good PR machine

09:24.464 --> 09:27.600
and they were churning out
a lot of different articles

09:27.634 --> 09:30.236
a lot of different TV interviews

09:30.269 --> 09:33.706
and I started listening to the facts.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.242
What they were saying,
and I said wait a minute

09:36.275 --> 09:38.177
this isn't the same case.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.979
I said there's...
There's something going on.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.616
But what's going on
is not what you see on TV.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.619
Walter Jones was hired
to defend the city of Chicago

09:46.653 --> 09:49.088
against Porter's civil suit.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.758
When I got called by the mayor's office

09:51.791 --> 09:54.794
and they said,
"Walter, we got a problem."

09:54.827 --> 09:59.398
We've got a guy
who has been on death row

09:59.432 --> 10:02.935
for over 16 years
and all of a sudden now

10:02.969 --> 10:05.137
he's gotten a pardon of innocence

10:05.171 --> 10:07.774
and the case has
turned into a huge mess.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.944
But it's not a case that
we are prepared to fold on

10:11.978 --> 10:15.915
because we have some police
officers who are adamant

10:15.948 --> 10:18.485
that they never did anything wrong.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.253
I knew that he had not
been wrongly accused.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.656
I knew that he belonged in jail.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.758
We got the right guy.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.660
We got the right offender.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.697
Jim Delorto and John Mazzola

10:30.730 --> 10:32.799
are retired federal investigators

10:32.832 --> 10:35.101
who took an interest in this case.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.437
They now work for Alstory
Simon's legal team.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.473
My partner Jim Delorto and I went to

10:40.507 --> 10:44.243
Danville Correctional Center
to interview Alstory Simon

10:44.276 --> 10:46.212
to find out if he could enlighten us

10:46.245 --> 10:49.849
as to what happened and why
he confessed to this crime.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.819
So we went down there,
hoping to learn something

10:52.852 --> 10:56.088
and we were astonished
by what he told us.

10:56.122 --> 10:59.759
In July 2001, without help
from an attorney

10:59.792 --> 11:02.829
Alstory Simon filed
a post conviction petition

11:02.862 --> 11:04.697
claiming that he was innocent.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.299
And that his confession was coerced.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.768
I never murdered anybody.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.303
I didn't have no involvement
in Marilyn Green's

11:11.337 --> 11:12.739
and Jerry Hillard's death.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.875
New allegations of misconduct
in the Porter-Simon cases

11:15.908 --> 11:17.476
have been filed in a complaint

11:17.510 --> 11:19.145
with the Illinois Supreme Court.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.681
It alleges Alstory Simon's lawyer knew

11:21.714 --> 11:23.282
he was innocent and that Porter

11:23.315 --> 11:26.753
should have never
been released from prison.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.121
Attorneys Jim Sotos and Terry Ekl

11:29.155 --> 11:31.791
now represent Alstory Simon.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.794
In my heart of hearts,
and I will go to my grave

11:34.827 --> 11:38.464
believing that Anthony Porter
committed this murder.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.534
And that Alstory Simon is 100% innocent.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.370
I'm just tired of this stuff.
I know that I'm innocent

11:44.403 --> 11:45.605
and these people just keep coming up

11:45.638 --> 11:47.607
bringing this stuff up,
like, harassing me.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.578
If we're gonna try this case,
we have to try this case

11:51.611 --> 11:54.446
like it was a brand new case.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.684
And we must show the jury
that he was guilty

11:57.717 --> 11:59.752
beyond a reasonable doubt.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.421
Because if we don't do that

12:02.454 --> 12:05.892
that verdict is going to be $24 million.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.393
People know that I'm innocent

12:07.426 --> 12:09.028
everybody know
that I'm innocent, you know.

12:09.061 --> 12:13.299
I'm innocent and this is what
happened to me.

12:13.332 --> 12:17.003
Based on all the work that we had done,

12:17.036 --> 12:20.472
there was no question in our mind that

12:20.506 --> 12:23.676
we had gotten this right
from the very beginning.

12:23.710 --> 12:27.680
And that Porter was responsible
for those killings.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.954
August 15, 1982

12:34.987 --> 12:41.027
in the very, very early hours of
August 15 after the conclusion of the,

12:41.060 --> 12:43.095
uh, Bud Billiken Parade.

12:43.129 --> 12:47.900
The community has a big parade
which ends at Washington Park

12:47.934 --> 12:50.870
and it's a day of celebration
in the black community

12:50.903 --> 12:53.405
with picnicking and games and...

12:53.439 --> 12:56.442
There were thousands
of people in the park.

12:56.475 --> 12:59.545
By 7 or 8 o'clock at night,

12:59.578 --> 13:01.347
the neighborhood starts to quiet down.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.448
Everybody's worn out.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.582
They've been partying

13:03.616 --> 13:06.185
since early in the day.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.721
And we look forward to the night because

13:08.755 --> 13:13.860
usually that night
was really quite calm.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.797
The night Jerry and Marilyn got killed

13:17.830 --> 13:21.400
I was 13 years old in 1982.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.135
Ray Brown didn't come forward

13:23.169 --> 13:25.872
with his story until 2006

13:25.905 --> 13:27.506
because he heard Porter had already

13:27.539 --> 13:29.809
been arrested for the crime.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.311
William Taylor
was the state's star witness

13:32.344 --> 13:36.115
against Porter at his 1983 trial.

13:36.148 --> 13:40.386
Just a fun, warm night,
drinking, socializing

13:40.419 --> 13:42.955
and... and it was extremely hot.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.258
So I said,
"Well, let's all go to the pool."

13:46.292 --> 13:48.828
On a hot night,
people got over the fences

13:48.861 --> 13:50.496
or through the fences.

13:50.596 --> 13:54.066
They swam, actually harmless fun.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.435
They didn't have enough police
working that night

13:56.468 --> 13:59.872
to chase them out and I don't think
we'd have chased them out anyway.

13:59.906 --> 14:03.475
Jerry Hilliard and Marilyn
Green were 18 and 19 years old

14:03.509 --> 14:05.277
sitting in the bleachers
of Washington Park

14:05.311 --> 14:07.980
about 1:00 in the morning
enjoying the night.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.017
First upon arrival,
I walked in through the gate

14:11.050 --> 14:12.785
to get into the bleachers.

14:12.819 --> 14:16.388
'Cause I seen Jerry and I seen his girl.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.457
And I spoke to him in, like

14:18.490 --> 14:20.559
"Little Ray,
your little bad self always."

14:20.592 --> 14:22.028
"Now, what you fitting gonna do?"

14:22.061 --> 14:24.330
You know, I'm like
"I'm fitting go swimming." You know.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.133
I was at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

14:27.166 --> 14:30.402
If I had kept my ass at home,
who knows how much better

14:30.436 --> 14:33.072
or more... much more pleasant
my life would have been.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.543
My partner Geraldine Perry and I were

14:37.576 --> 14:42.481
violent crime detectives
and we heard the call of, uh,

14:42.514 --> 14:46.418
2 people shot in Washington Park

14:46.452 --> 14:49.455
in the bleachers just to
the west of the swimming pool

14:49.488 --> 14:52.124
alongside of the field house.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.194
And the police, when they
investigated the crime scene

14:55.227 --> 14:58.697
they found a necklace on the
floor here of Marilyn Green.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.033
And the police speculated that

15:01.067 --> 15:03.602
a motive may have been robbery
and that she resisted

15:03.635 --> 15:07.306
because she was shot through
her hand and into her neck.

15:07.339 --> 15:10.509
After she got shot,
her boyfriend got shot.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.746
He was shot twice in the head.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.984
Marilyn Green, after getting
shot, was holding her neck.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.486
She staggered down these steps.

15:20.519 --> 15:24.390
She came out this north gate
towards the parking lot

15:24.423 --> 15:26.225
right when Officer Anthony Liace

15:26.258 --> 15:28.094
was pulling up in his squad car.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.862
She was holding her neck

15:29.896 --> 15:31.330
pointing towards the bleachers

15:31.363 --> 15:33.499
and then she ran past Liace

15:33.532 --> 15:37.269
and then Officer Billy Johnson
had a squad care there.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.039
Marilynn Green was placed
in Officer Johnson's squad car

15:40.072 --> 15:42.308
and rushed to the hospital.

15:42.341 --> 15:46.612
Officers Liace and Anderson
ran south behind the bleachers

15:46.645 --> 15:49.448
and saw a man fleeing the area.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.484
They stopped and frisked the man.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.788
Finding no weapon, they let him go.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.057
My partner and I proceeded
up into the stands

15:58.090 --> 16:00.692
where we saw a young man leaning back

16:00.726 --> 16:03.329
against the back wall of the bleachers.

16:03.362 --> 16:06.265
I told the 2 witnesses
to grab the victim's shoulders

16:06.298 --> 16:08.600
and I grabbed his feet
and we walked him down

16:08.634 --> 16:10.436
out of the stands.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.172
He was in very serious condition.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.974
We called for a wagon to transport him

16:15.007 --> 16:17.176
to the hospital soon as possible.

16:17.209 --> 16:19.979
The wagon took him off
to Billings Hospital

16:20.012 --> 16:21.480
where he died later.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.150
I found out later that the female victim

16:24.183 --> 16:26.785
had died at Providence Hospital.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.497
It was a loss.
I mean, she was so young.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.667
And she had 2 kids.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.670
Well, I love my sister, and I miss her.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.038
And I wish it never happened.

16:46.072 --> 16:49.541
I wish she was never up
up in Washington Park.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.378
Detectives Dwyer and Perry
interviewed witnesses

16:52.411 --> 16:54.713
Henry Williams and William Taylor.

16:54.746 --> 16:57.816
And learned that Porter had
robbed Williams at gunpoint

16:57.850 --> 17:01.353
before entering the bleachers
and sitting near the victims.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.323
Henry told me this... this himself.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.792
That Porter had came over by him

17:07.826 --> 17:09.661
and stuck him up.

17:09.694 --> 17:13.598
I came to work
at approximately 20 after 4.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.535
My supervising sergeant
called me in and he said

17:16.568 --> 17:19.939
"Chuck, you and Dennis are
gonna pick up the double

17:19.972 --> 17:22.641
from Washington Park last night."

17:22.674 --> 17:26.444
So we talked to the detectives,
we reviewed the reports

17:26.478 --> 17:28.847
and then we talked to the witnesses.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.918
One of the witnesses, William Taylor

17:31.951 --> 17:33.352
he wanted to leave.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.188
At that point, he was telling
us he saw the shooting

17:36.222 --> 17:38.190
but he didn't know who the offender was.

17:38.224 --> 17:42.828
But the robbery victim
said to us off to the side

17:42.861 --> 17:44.997
"Listen, he's lying to you."

17:45.031 --> 17:47.166
He actually did see the murder.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.936
He knows who did it,
but he's really afraid.

17:49.969 --> 17:53.072
Taylor admitted to detectives
Salvatore and Gray

17:53.105 --> 17:55.674
that he did see Porter shoot the victims

17:55.707 --> 17:59.378
but he was terrified
of Porter and his family.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.581
A couple of the Porter brothers knew me

18:02.614 --> 18:05.717
and that I was involved in this case.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.554
I said, well, anything to keep any harm

18:08.587 --> 18:11.023
from coming to my great grandmother.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.060
Because I actually witnessed him mugging

18:14.093 --> 18:17.663
2 seniors one day in front the building.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.366
After Taylor ID'd Porter as the shooter

18:20.399 --> 18:22.834
detectives called
Assistant State's Attorney

18:22.868 --> 18:26.172
David Kerstein
from the Felony Review Unit.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.707
It was Kerstein's job to ensure the case

18:28.740 --> 18:31.710
had enough evidence for prosecution.

18:31.743 --> 18:35.047
After talking to the 2 witnesses

18:35.081 --> 18:38.250
I had a conversation
with the detectives involved.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.787
And I said,
"I'm sorry, it's not enough for me."

18:41.820 --> 18:43.956
So what I demanded that they do

18:43.990 --> 18:47.393
is that we transport the witnesses

18:47.426 --> 18:50.396
to the park to reenact the crime itself.

18:50.429 --> 18:53.932
The 5 of us, we go to Washington Park.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.901
You know, they were walking
us through, uh

18:55.934 --> 18:59.671
what happened and where they
were at etcetera, etcetera.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.008
Now, I made sure that they
were independent of each other

19:02.041 --> 19:04.210
and the reason for it is I didn't want

19:04.243 --> 19:06.578
one of the witnesses to
influence the other witness.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.716
The first 2 witnesses to come in were

19:10.749 --> 19:13.085
William Taylor and Henry Williams.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.520
It was about 1:00 in the morning.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.722
They decided to hop the fence in here.

19:16.755 --> 19:19.958
Right behind me, they hopped the
fence in here to go swimming.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.661
And they came over the fence,
took off some of their clothes

19:22.694 --> 19:25.331
proceeded to the south part of the pool

19:25.364 --> 19:27.699
and they jumped in the water
and went swimming.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.601
Then, Williams decides he's had enough

19:29.635 --> 19:32.071
and he comes out right
in this area where I'm at

19:32.104 --> 19:34.173
and starts to put his cloths back on.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.109
As he's doing that, he sees
a man approach him

19:37.143 --> 19:39.045
and as that man gets closer he realizes

19:39.078 --> 19:40.479
it's somebody he knows
from the neighborhood.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.014
It's Tony Porter.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.483
Tony Porter comes up to him and says

19:44.516 --> 19:45.751
"Give me your money."

19:45.784 --> 19:48.287
And Williams says,
"I don't have any money."

19:48.320 --> 19:49.988
Porter then takes out a gun and puts it

19:50.022 --> 19:52.758
right to Williams' head,
to his forehead.

19:52.791 --> 19:56.862
Reaches in Williams' pocket,
pulls out $2 and says

19:56.895 --> 19:58.530
"I'm giving you a break."

19:58.564 --> 20:01.033
He doesn't shoot him and he walks away.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.635
And Williams then said a few
minutes later when he looked

20:03.669 --> 20:05.671
to the north end of the bleachers

20:05.704 --> 20:07.706
he could see Porter up at the top

20:07.739 --> 20:10.409
with the 2 victims.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.811
And then a few minutes later,
Taylor comes out of the pool

20:12.844 --> 20:16.548
and he starts to dry off
and he hears shots.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.617
And he turns around to the
north side of the bleachers

20:18.650 --> 20:20.552
where he hears the shots coming from.

20:20.586 --> 20:24.256
Taylor says he sees Porter
at point blank range

20:24.290 --> 20:26.892
pointing the gun at a male victim.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.161
And he see's Porter fire the gun.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.363
And the victim falls back.

20:31.397 --> 20:35.834
Taylor then says he sees Porter
shoot the victim again.

20:35.867 --> 20:39.505
After the shots are fired,
Porter runs down the stairs

20:39.538 --> 20:41.407
right down this walkway from the north

20:41.440 --> 20:42.841
towards me to the south.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.444
I looked up and I saw him
running down the steps.

20:45.477 --> 20:48.580
Right past me out the south gate.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.117
Tony Porter.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.019
At that point, I was somewhat satisfied

20:54.052 --> 20:55.854
with what they had told me

20:55.887 --> 20:59.791
matched their interview that
I had earlier at the station.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.094
And we found out that the eyewitness

21:02.128 --> 21:03.762
who said he had seen Anthony Porter

21:03.795 --> 21:06.498
committing the crime
couldn't have seen it at all.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.935
In 1999, the Northwestern
students conducted

21:09.968 --> 21:12.671
a reenactment in Washington Park

21:12.704 --> 21:14.840
and concluded that William Taylor

21:14.873 --> 21:17.075
couldn't have seen Porter
commit the murders.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.479
Because his view would have
been blocked by an iron fence

21:20.512 --> 21:22.181
and obstructions in the bleachers.

21:22.214 --> 21:26.285
And they all said it took
place at the very corner

21:26.318 --> 21:28.520
of the bleachers.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.056
I saw the crime photographs and I says

21:31.089 --> 21:34.025
"Wait a minute, this is wrong."

21:34.059 --> 21:35.361
They're wrong.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.129
The students were not examining

21:37.163 --> 21:39.064
the actual crime location.

21:39.097 --> 21:42.701
And were unaware that the
obstructions they cited in 1999

21:42.734 --> 21:46.838
weren't in the bleachers in 1982.

21:46.872 --> 21:50.942
You can look from the pool
area up into the bleachers.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.546
Unobstructed, even through
the fence you can see.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.649
While Kerstein questioned
Taylor and Williams at the pool

21:57.683 --> 21:59.785
a detective overheard 2 men talking

21:59.818 --> 22:02.488
about seeing Porter kill the victims.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.623
Their names were Kenneth Edwards

22:04.656 --> 22:06.325
and Michael Woodfork.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.994
And they asked if we saw

22:09.027 --> 22:12.398
what happened last night
and Mike said yeah.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.367
That's when they find out, that's
when they get to know the story

22:15.401 --> 22:17.703
that, no, we saw what happened.

22:17.736 --> 22:19.938
So then he started talking to him

22:19.971 --> 22:22.341
and he started walking back
with him and he says

22:22.374 --> 22:23.409
"You ain't gonna believe this."

22:23.442 --> 22:25.444
He says, "They saw the shooting"

22:25.477 --> 22:28.180
and they just ID'd Porter.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.117
It was out of nowhere that
these 2 other witnesses

22:32.150 --> 22:34.253
who had been previously undiscovered.

22:34.286 --> 22:37.456
No one knew of them,
came forward to talk to us.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.590
I am positive

22:38.624 --> 22:40.025
that Anthony Porter killed those people.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.994
I saw him with my own eyes.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.831
With this new information,
detectives took Edwards

22:45.864 --> 22:48.967
and Woodfork to the police
station for further interviews.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.471
They also spoke with Mark
Senior and Eugene Beckwith.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.774
Two witnesses who saw Porter in
the stands with the victims.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.245
Like William and Taylor, those 4 guys

22:59.278 --> 23:01.813
entered the pool area from the north

23:01.847 --> 23:04.115
walked along that same walkway

23:04.149 --> 23:06.017
and then when they got
to the point right here

23:06.051 --> 23:07.853
where they were about to hop the fence

23:07.886 --> 23:11.156
they looked up in the bleachers
and they saw 4 people.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.792
3 men and 1 female.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.295
And Edwards, Beckwith

23:16.328 --> 23:18.997
and Senior would all tell the police

23:19.030 --> 23:22.401
that one of the men up in
the bleachers was Tony Porter

23:22.434 --> 23:23.969
and Tony Porter was somebody

23:24.002 --> 23:25.704
they knew from the neighborhood.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.206
And we walked past them and we were like

23:28.240 --> 23:30.041
"What's up Tone? What's up Tone?"
you know.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.577
'Cause he was the only one we knew

23:31.610 --> 23:33.945
out of those 4 people.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.315
Beckwith and Edwards
decide to go swimming

23:36.348 --> 23:38.016
And they proceed to hop the fence

23:38.049 --> 23:39.551
and come into the pool area.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.986
And they jump in the water.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.454
'Cause they're gonna use
the diving boards

23:42.488 --> 23:44.656
at the south end of the pool.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.057
They were on these diving boards

23:46.091 --> 23:47.826
at the time of the shooting.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.896
According to Beckwith,
he was on the high dive

23:50.929 --> 23:52.698
and he noticed on the north
end of the bleachers

23:52.731 --> 23:55.434
4 people, 3 men and a woman.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.902
And he says Tony Porter

23:56.935 --> 23:59.805
was absolutely one
of the person's in that group.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.907
He saw a male stand up
and shoot somebody.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.141
He's not sure if Porter

24:03.174 --> 24:05.076
was actually the guy who fired the gun.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.245
Edwards was the guy who had

24:07.279 --> 24:09.047
already jumped off the diving board

24:09.080 --> 24:10.649
and was standing
right about where I'm at

24:10.682 --> 24:12.651
which is a raised area.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.052
And from here

24:14.085 --> 24:16.121
you can easily see over the fence

24:16.154 --> 24:18.390
into the north part of the bleachers.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.492
And he actually saw Porter

24:20.526 --> 24:23.395
fire the gun that killed Jerry Hillard.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.397
And all of a sudden
you just see pow, pow.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.734
When I see that, I tell
Eugene to get down

24:28.767 --> 24:31.803
'cause I don't want them to see
us up there seeing them.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.706
I saw Porter.

24:34.740 --> 24:37.008
I saw Tony Porter and I saw him do it.

24:37.042 --> 24:39.911
So I wanna get down because
I don't want him to know

24:39.945 --> 24:42.581
that that's us up there
because he knows us.

24:42.614 --> 24:46.284
Edwards then exited
the pool area to the south

24:46.318 --> 24:48.119
along with Beckwith.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.220
We're not looking back.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.922
We're just taking off.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.395
So once I got off the diving
board and went in 9 feet

24:56.428 --> 25:00.098
I swam up to get out
of the swimming pool.

25:01.132 --> 25:03.702
And, uh, I see Anthony Porter.

25:03.735 --> 25:06.304
Right there in the bleachers.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.508
He shot 'em and killed 'em and he ran.

25:09.541 --> 25:12.143
You know, leaving out the swimming pool.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.480
Senior and Woodfork were

25:14.513 --> 25:17.483
in the bleachers here
talking to a couple of girls

25:17.516 --> 25:19.217
And when the shots were fired

25:19.250 --> 25:20.719
they looked behind them

25:20.752 --> 25:23.254
to the north and saw
the shots being fired.

25:23.288 --> 25:25.491
Of the 4 people that were there

25:25.524 --> 25:27.393
how many were men and
how many were women?

25:27.426 --> 25:29.260
3 men, 1 woman.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.463
Anthony Porter being one
of the men, is that right?

25:31.497 --> 25:32.498
Correct.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.232
None of those 3 people

25:34.265 --> 25:36.034
was Alstory Simon, is that correct?

25:36.067 --> 25:38.003
Not that I can recall, no.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.673
And the Northwestern students

25:41.707 --> 25:43.809
didn't even talk to those 4 witnesses.

25:45.243 --> 25:47.312
"Did you interview any of those people?"

25:47.345 --> 25:49.214
"No, we didn't because they all said

25:49.247 --> 25:52.150
it was too dark to
see anything, I think."

25:52.183 --> 25:53.919
"That's what I thought they said."

25:53.952 --> 25:55.787
That's just completely false.

25:55.821 --> 25:58.524
And for her to say that
is just mind boggling

25:58.557 --> 25:59.891
to act like the people in the park

25:59.925 --> 26:01.993
were inconsequential.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.295
"Were you aware that
Kenneth Edwards identified

26:04.329 --> 26:06.732
Anthony Porter as
the shooter that night?"

26:06.765 --> 26:10.168
"No, I guess I didn't see that
part of the police report."

26:10.201 --> 26:13.204
A 100% positive Anthony Porter did it.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.740
I saw him.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.075
"Mr. Edwards identified Anthony Porter

26:17.108 --> 26:19.177
as the shooter that night, did he not?"

26:19.210 --> 26:22.013
"I would have to go back
over the report."

26:22.047 --> 26:23.181
"And your students didn't investigate

26:23.214 --> 26:24.783
these 4 men, did they?"

26:24.816 --> 26:26.251
"No."

26:26.284 --> 26:29.087
"You didn't ask Paul Ciolino
to find those 4 men?"

26:29.120 --> 26:30.656
"No."

26:30.689 --> 26:32.524
"You didn't go out yourself
and look for those 4 men?"

26:32.558 --> 26:33.792
Answered, "No."

26:33.825 --> 26:35.494
Question, "None of your
group ever conducted

26:35.527 --> 26:37.128
any interview of those 4 men."

26:37.162 --> 26:38.464
Answer, "That's correct."

26:38.497 --> 26:41.032
Would you expect
your students to interview

26:41.066 --> 26:43.935
all people who claim
to have witnessed a crime

26:43.969 --> 26:45.136
the underlying crime?

26:45.170 --> 26:47.072
- No.
- Why not?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.541
Because many of the times
they can't be found.

26:49.575 --> 26:52.778
No one even attempted to find
any of these witnesses

26:52.811 --> 26:55.814
David Protess admitted that
in his grand jury testimony.

26:55.847 --> 26:59.585
We find other independent witness.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.221
But the combination of all 4

27:03.254 --> 27:05.557
speaking to me independently

27:05.591 --> 27:08.259
added up to only one conclusion to me.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.261
And that was Anthony Porter

27:10.295 --> 27:12.964
was in some way involved in this case.

27:12.998 --> 27:16.301
It was at that point I then felt

27:16.334 --> 27:18.904
that a warrant for his
arrest should be made.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.572
After the warrant was issued

27:20.606 --> 27:22.273
Porter turned himself in

27:22.307 --> 27:25.076
but denied involvement in the murders.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.945
The state called 3 witnesses

27:26.978 --> 27:29.481
at Porter's 1983 trial.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.683
William Taylor, Henry Williams

27:31.717 --> 27:34.419
and Officer Anthony Liace.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.822
Officer Liace identified Anthony Porter

27:36.855 --> 27:40.626
in court as the person he
stopped behind the bleachers.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.594
Anthony Porter elected not to testify

27:42.628 --> 27:43.829
at his criminal trial.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.764
One of his friends did testify

27:45.797 --> 27:48.099
that he and Porter
were drinking all night

27:48.133 --> 27:49.768
at Porter's house and outside
in the playground

27:49.801 --> 27:51.870
until the early hours of the morning.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.438
It was a jury trial.

27:53.471 --> 27:57.242
They came back and they found
him guilty of both homicides.

27:57.275 --> 27:59.144
After the jury found Porter guilty

27:59.177 --> 28:00.579
the death penalty phase began

28:00.612 --> 28:02.748
and the state called 2 witnesses.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.349
Earl Lewis testified

28:04.382 --> 28:06.051
that a couple weeks before the murders

28:06.084 --> 28:09.521
Anthony Porter walked by his
house, kicked his dog

28:09.555 --> 28:11.422
Lewis objected, Porter pulled out a gun

28:11.456 --> 28:14.292
and shot Lewis in the head.

28:14.325 --> 28:16.595
Luckily, Lewis survived.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.029
'Cause he was a bully.
He was...

28:18.063 --> 28:19.965
He was a terrified man back then.

28:19.998 --> 28:22.200
You say that name
back then, Anthony Porter

28:22.233 --> 28:24.536
everybody ran.
He was feared.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.238
Just a renegade all the way around.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.575
Douglas McGhee testified that in 1979

28:29.608 --> 28:32.744
Anthony Porter robbed him
and viciously beat him.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.146
That robbery and beating
took place in Washington Park

28:35.180 --> 28:37.315
in the very same bleachers
as the murders.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.352
Judge Robert Sklodowski sentenced Porter

28:41.386 --> 28:43.488
to death by lethal injection.

28:43.521 --> 28:45.957
And likened Porter to a shark

28:45.991 --> 28:48.426
that returns to the same feeding ground.

28:48.459 --> 28:51.196
This was not a case where these people

28:51.229 --> 28:53.732
had never seen Anthony Porter before

28:53.765 --> 28:55.967
and were seeing some stranger.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.103
They all knew who he was

28:58.136 --> 28:59.605
from the neighborhood.

28:59.638 --> 29:02.240
Anthony Porter did these murders

29:02.273 --> 29:04.009
and he got the break of his life

29:04.042 --> 29:06.277
when he got freed from the penitentiary.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.113
The reason that my students
were able to do it

29:08.146 --> 29:09.581
when the prosecutors did not

29:09.615 --> 29:12.217
is because the police started
with the assumption

29:12.250 --> 29:13.752
that Anthony Porter was guilty

29:13.785 --> 29:15.587
and tried to build a case around him.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.022
They railroaded him.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.124
We started with no assumption at all.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.759
We stared
with an objective view of this.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.761
We didn't know whether
he was guilty or innocent.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.395
Our goal was to search for the truth.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.865
Anyone who would look at the evidence

29:26.898 --> 29:31.436
and say that what Northwestern did in
this case was to search for the truth.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.171
We're working for the truth.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.340
That would be laughable.

29:35.373 --> 29:41.947
This is an email that David Protess sent
to Paul Ciolino on November 5, 1998

29:41.980 --> 29:46.785
before there had been any evidence
developed against Alstory Simon.

29:46.818 --> 29:49.420
William Taylor hadn't said a word.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.256
They had not talked to Walter Jackson.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.458
They had not talked to Inez Jackson.

29:53.491 --> 29:56.061
They hadn't talked to Alstory Simon.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.195
And yet at the beginning

29:57.228 --> 29:59.430
of November of 1998

29:59.464 --> 30:00.799
David Protess sends

30:00.832 --> 30:03.168
Paul Ciolino an email and says

30:03.201 --> 30:05.737
"Now, it's your turn to find people."

30:05.771 --> 30:09.808
"Here's what I have on the guy
we're almost certain was the killer

30:09.841 --> 30:14.245
in the crime for which
Anthony Porter faces death."

30:14.279 --> 30:18.817
Protess and his journalism students
met Porter and his attorney in prison

30:18.850 --> 30:22.553
on two separate occasions
in December 1998.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.557
I mean, th... this is
a journalist's dream.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.761
To be in a jail with a prisoner

30:29.795 --> 30:32.931
asking him all the vital questions.

30:32.964 --> 30:35.100
Let's take Shawn Armbrust.

30:35.133 --> 30:39.070
"What was it about that meeting that
convinced you he was innocent?"

30:39.104 --> 30:40.571
"Well, the reason we were
going to meet him

30:40.605 --> 30:42.874
was to ask him
if he committed the crime."

30:42.908 --> 30:45.276
"But the first thing he said
was that he was innocent."

30:45.310 --> 30:49.915
"And I've heard people say that before
but he was more convincing."

30:59.357 --> 31:01.292
That sounds to me like Professor Protess

31:01.326 --> 31:05.196
was teaching his students
advocacy, not journalism.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.032
A grand juror asked another student

31:07.065 --> 31:08.767
Syandene Rhodes.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.368
"What would you say is the objective

31:10.401 --> 31:12.971
of your assignment you were given?"

31:13.004 --> 31:16.074
"I believe the objective would be
to find any evidence, interview

31:16.107 --> 31:19.010
anyone you could that would
lead you to freeing this man."

31:20.145 --> 31:21.346
So there you have an honest answer.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.414
It wasn't about finding the truth

31:23.448 --> 31:25.383
it was about freeing Anthony Porter.

31:26.684 --> 31:28.219
It's interesting
after hearing all this evidence

31:28.253 --> 31:29.888
a grand juror even asked

31:29.921 --> 31:33.691
"Is it possible that you were just
a pawn in this whole process?"

31:33.725 --> 31:35.526
The grand juror asks

31:35.560 --> 31:37.929
"What is motivating the move
towards this direction

31:37.963 --> 31:40.398
where there's a lot of evidence that
you've admitted that you've seen

31:40.431 --> 31:42.300
but passed over blindly?"

31:42.333 --> 31:43.935
And Syandene says,

31:43.969 --> 31:46.938
"I know what I've been doing
for the past month and that is

31:46.972 --> 31:49.140
investigating
Anthony Porter's innocence."

31:49.174 --> 31:50.976
And the grand juror says,

31:51.009 --> 31:53.278
"Or guilt. He may be guilty?"

31:53.311 --> 31:57.348
So what he has essentially
done in the grand jury

31:57.382 --> 31:59.017
there's no question about it.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.186
He has certainly proven that it was

32:01.219 --> 32:04.289
a meaningless investigation
by the students.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.157
But more importantly

32:06.191 --> 32:08.326
he's re-convicted Porter.

32:11.562 --> 32:14.232
For the last 16 years
he's waited on death row.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.500
Tonight, there's new information

32:15.533 --> 32:17.168
that suggests he shouldn't be there.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.770
Now, the man who helped put him there

32:18.804 --> 32:21.907
the state's only witness
is changing his story.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.208
One of the biggest fallacies

32:23.241 --> 32:24.675
of this entire saga

32:24.709 --> 32:27.779
is that Northwestern portrayed

32:27.813 --> 32:29.280
the situation to be that

32:29.314 --> 32:32.550
there was a single witness
who had identified

32:32.583 --> 32:35.120
Anthony Porter who then recanted.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.488
There were 6 witnesses
implicating Porter.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.958
Northwestern talked to one.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.026
Henry Williams was dead

32:41.059 --> 32:42.794
and Northwestern totally ignored

32:42.828 --> 32:45.263
the other four witnesses that
were in the park that night.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.332
And it was based on that portrayal

32:47.365 --> 32:49.534
that they were ultimately able to undo

32:49.567 --> 32:51.602
Anthony Porter's conviction.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.304
They stay on people

32:53.338 --> 32:55.106
to try to finally get something

32:55.140 --> 32:57.375
out of them that fits their theory

32:57.408 --> 32:59.710
of who they think did the case.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.180
Tom McCann, one
of the Northwestern students

33:02.213 --> 33:04.382
was the first to contact Taylor.

33:04.415 --> 33:08.887
I got a phone call from
a student named Tom McCann.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.189
He wanted to talk
about the Tony Porter case.

33:11.222 --> 33:13.925
I said, "Look, I'm through with this."

33:13.959 --> 33:15.493
"I don't want to be bothered."

33:15.526 --> 33:17.462
"Don't call here anymore."

33:17.495 --> 33:19.097
And hung up.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.498
McCann talked to William Taylor

33:20.531 --> 33:22.333
and he prepared a memo.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.469
In the memo, McCann says Taylor

33:24.502 --> 33:27.538
told him, "There was
no doubt in his mind

33:27.572 --> 33:29.607
that this man was guilty."

33:29.640 --> 33:34.445
"He will not be happy until
Porter is finally executed."

33:34.479 --> 33:36.882
"And before hanging up he told McCann

33:36.915 --> 33:40.318
he didn't want to talk
about the case anymore."

33:40.351 --> 33:42.921
That's all Paul Ciolino needed to hear.

33:42.954 --> 33:45.290
Next thing I know

33:45.323 --> 33:47.592
Ciolino and McCann

33:47.625 --> 33:49.394
show up unannounced.

33:49.427 --> 33:53.264
They're telling me, "Well, you know
this is all for the better good"

33:53.298 --> 33:55.800
which I had no idea
what they're talking about.

33:55.833 --> 33:58.336
And then they're trying to tell me

33:58.369 --> 34:00.538
that in the end

34:00.571 --> 34:02.740
I was wrong.

34:02.773 --> 34:04.309
I don't know how that went down

34:04.342 --> 34:07.145
but they had basically convinced me that

34:07.178 --> 34:09.780
I didn't see him shoot anybody.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.918
But I did see him run out of the park.

34:12.951 --> 34:15.453
And I said, "Well, maybe
I did make a mistake,

34:15.485 --> 34:17.155
but I don't think I did."

34:17.188 --> 34:20.958
But I said, "Okay, if this is
the way they want to play this,

34:20.992 --> 34:23.027
I'll, yeah, I'll play the game."

34:23.061 --> 34:25.030
You know, just to get them
out of my hair.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.665
Because then the cycle of

34:27.697 --> 34:29.600
calling my job

34:29.634 --> 34:31.036
upsetting my life again.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.203
I wanted it done.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.105
I wanted it over with.

34:34.139 --> 34:37.275
And then what, 20...
almost 20 years later.

34:37.308 --> 34:38.809
Again?

34:38.842 --> 34:42.580
No by any means possible,
here I'll sign this.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.382
And at that point

34:44.415 --> 34:49.387
Ciolino writes an affidavit a statement.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.123
I did not see Anthony Porter
shoot anyone.

34:52.157 --> 34:55.626
I'm telling Tom he's just seen
something that's very, very rare.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.096
And that's the only surviving eyewitness

34:58.129 --> 34:59.897
in a murder case
retracting his testimony.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.501
It was a big moment and it was
a critical moment for Anthony Porter.

35:03.534 --> 35:06.171
The significance of this is
that William Taylor

35:06.204 --> 35:09.740
is the state's star witness in the case
and the only eyewitness in a case

35:09.774 --> 35:12.410
where there is no confession
and no physical evidence.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.546
So his recantation,
the admission of his lie

35:15.580 --> 35:19.084
indicates that there is now no
evidence against Anthony Porter.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.518
So when you watch those clips

35:20.551 --> 35:22.220
you come away with a perception

35:22.253 --> 35:24.789
that the only witness
against Anthony Porter

35:24.822 --> 35:27.625
has now recanted his testimony
and there's no case against him.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.594
That couldn't have been further
from the truth.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.296
Then the eyewitness recanted.

35:31.329 --> 35:35.066
They call it recant and
what they get him to say is

35:35.100 --> 35:38.236
"I was in the park, I never
saw Porter with a gun,

35:38.269 --> 35:40.305
I didn't see Porter fire the shot."

35:40.338 --> 35:43.074
And this is the journalism's professor

35:43.108 --> 35:44.909
of one of the top, if not the top

35:44.942 --> 35:47.045
journalism schools in the country.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.713
Does an affidavit

35:48.746 --> 35:50.115
that intentionally leaves out

35:50.148 --> 35:51.949
the most important fact of all.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.918
I saw Anthony Porter

35:53.951 --> 35:56.354
run past, down the bleachers stairs

35:56.387 --> 35:59.257
right past me out of the south gate.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.726
That was something that William Taylor

36:01.759 --> 36:03.894
told Northwestern

36:03.928 --> 36:07.232
before they obtained his affidavit

36:07.265 --> 36:09.667
and they just left it
out of the affidavit.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.936
"But that was not included
in the affidavit

36:11.969 --> 36:15.340
where he saw Anthony Porter
in the park that night, right?"

36:15.373 --> 36:16.507
"Right."

36:16.541 --> 36:19.910
They zeroed me out and spun me around.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.413
It's trying to make people
think that's all the evidence

36:22.447 --> 36:23.948
there was against Anthony Porter

36:23.981 --> 36:27.252
was William Taylor and he recanted

36:27.285 --> 36:29.920
therefore, it equals
Anthony Porter's innocence.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.190
That's a croc of BS.

36:32.223 --> 36:34.925
Anthony Porter,
I still think in my heart

36:34.959 --> 36:36.561
is guilty.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.064
This is the question from
state's attorney gainer.

36:39.097 --> 36:41.932
"But, Tom, what did you
tell us your purpose was?"

36:41.966 --> 36:43.801
"What were you doing this for?"

36:43.834 --> 36:46.537
"To find the truth,
but I'm a college student."

36:46.571 --> 36:48.906
"I mean, this took a long time."

36:48.939 --> 36:51.976
"Let's go with that, you're a
college student, I understand that."

36:52.009 --> 36:55.146
"Who told you to quit when you
got to the Taylor affidavit?"

36:55.180 --> 36:57.348
"No one, we only had a very short time,

36:57.382 --> 37:00.585
so we decided to look
at the alternate suspect."

37:02.620 --> 37:04.922
The trail that the students would follow

37:04.955 --> 37:07.825
began with the mother
of one of the murder victims.

37:11.262 --> 37:14.065
Mrs. Green told police
that Marilyn and Jerry

37:14.099 --> 37:17.602
left for the park that
day with Inez and Alstory.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.137
Which everybody knew to be the case.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.139
Inez and Marilyn were friends.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.873
They, including Alstory Simon

37:22.907 --> 37:24.875
were in the park
with thousands of other people

37:24.909 --> 37:26.444
earlier in the day.

37:26.477 --> 37:28.213
According to Inez's son

37:28.246 --> 37:30.815
Sonny Jackson, his mother and Alstory

37:30.848 --> 37:33.584
came home early around
7 o'clock in the evening.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.421
The murders didn't take place

37:36.454 --> 37:39.524
until after 1:00 in the morning.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.760
A few weeks after the murders,
Simon and his family

37:42.793 --> 37:44.662
moved to another Chicago neighborhood

37:44.695 --> 37:47.132
because of gang attacks on their home.

37:47.165 --> 37:50.835
Months later, they moved
to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

37:59.377 --> 38:00.711
And they seized

38:00.745 --> 38:02.447
on the name of a guy who's name

38:02.480 --> 38:04.249
had surfaced at some point

38:04.282 --> 38:06.951
but with no evidence and concluded

38:06.984 --> 38:10.288
that they were almost certain
he was the real killer.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.089
With Simon in their sights

38:12.123 --> 38:14.759
David Protess and 2 female students

38:14.792 --> 38:18.829
drove from Chicago
to Simon's home in Milwaukee.

38:18.863 --> 38:21.332
Protess sits in the car

38:21.366 --> 38:23.201
it's late at night.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.271
The 2 students knock on the front door.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.473
Alstory Simon invites them in

38:28.506 --> 38:30.941
closes the door, says,
"How can I help you?"

38:30.975 --> 38:33.711
They said that they were doing a...

38:33.744 --> 38:38.816
A story and writing a book
on justice and unsolved murders.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.419
And that my name popped up.

38:41.452 --> 38:44.121
I asked them, "What do you
mean my name popped up?"

38:44.155 --> 38:46.191
They asked me did Jerry Hillard

38:46.224 --> 38:48.626
and Marilyn Green ring a bell?

38:48.659 --> 38:50.228
I said, "Yeah, it ring a bell."

38:50.261 --> 38:52.563
So what's that got to do with me?

38:52.597 --> 38:55.200
I told them, you know, the truth

38:55.233 --> 38:58.169
that I didn't know nothing
about their deaths.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.205
The interview only lasted for

39:00.238 --> 39:03.040
maybe like 5 or 10 minutes.

39:03.073 --> 39:05.643
Then, after I escorted them out

39:05.676 --> 39:08.779
Professor Protess got out of this SUV

39:08.813 --> 39:10.915
and walked over to me

39:10.948 --> 39:12.817
and then tells me

39:12.850 --> 39:16.020
uh, he want to thank me
for talking to his students.

39:16.053 --> 39:19.357
And give me a card
after introducing his-self.

39:19.390 --> 39:22.126
Uh, when the students walks
across the street

39:22.159 --> 39:25.663
Professor Protess, he tells me that

39:25.696 --> 39:29.767
a man is getting ready
to die for something I did.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.470
And I said, "Wha... what
do you mean something I did?"

39:32.503 --> 39:34.605
"What are you talking about?"

39:34.639 --> 39:36.841
And then he tells me, uh

39:36.874 --> 39:40.911
we know that
you killed Jerry and Marilyn.

39:40.945 --> 39:42.713
I said, "Man, I ain't
killed nobody, man."

39:42.747 --> 39:45.450
"Whoever telling you that stuff
is sending you for a ride."

39:45.483 --> 39:49.887
"You get the hell away from me and...
And don't come to my house no more."

39:49.920 --> 39:51.188
And he left.

39:55.593 --> 39:58.796
In 1999, Northwestern, at
the urging of Anthony Porter

39:58.829 --> 40:01.499
contacted Walter Jackson,
Alstory Simon's nephew.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.002
Jackson signed
an affidavit for Northwestern

40:05.035 --> 40:07.305
stating that Alstory Simon had told him

40:07.338 --> 40:11.175
that he had taken care
of Jerry and Marilyn.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.777
It sounded pretty suspicious.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.980
Why would this be something
he kept to himself for 17 years

40:16.013 --> 40:18.449
and he just reveals
to students from Northwestern

40:18.483 --> 40:20.418
but that's what he said.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.953
6 years later Simon's lawyers
talk to Walter Jackson

40:22.987 --> 40:25.690
and he told them a much different story.

40:25.723 --> 40:28.893
And what we learned
was that Anthony Porter

40:28.926 --> 40:32.162
had set this whole thing up from prison.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.998
Anthony Porter and Walter Jackson

40:34.031 --> 40:36.567
were incarcerated together.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.804
Anthony Porter had saved
Walter Jackson from an attack.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.441
He approached Walter Jackson

41:16.474 --> 41:19.143
and he said, "Hey, can you help
me out with my case?"

41:19.176 --> 41:21.912
"We're trying to pin this
on Alstory Simon

41:21.946 --> 41:25.249
and you can help with that
and in return

41:25.282 --> 41:27.818
this Northwestern professor
that I'm working with

41:27.852 --> 41:30.455
can help get you out of prison."

41:30.488 --> 41:34.525
"And we need your Aunt Inez
to help us with this too."

41:34.559 --> 41:36.126
Walter Jackson admitted

41:36.160 --> 41:40.064
that he lied about Simon's
involvement in the murders.

41:40.097 --> 41:43.167
In late 1998, Jackson alleged

41:43.200 --> 41:45.503
that David Protess contacted him

41:45.536 --> 41:48.506
and told him that if he helped
free Anthony Porter

41:48.539 --> 41:50.240
he would work to get him out of jail.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.977
And that there would be money
waiting for him

41:53.010 --> 41:54.679
when he got out.

41:54.712 --> 41:56.814
So Walter Jackson agrees to do that.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.049
He calls his Aunt Inez.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.386
Alstory Simon's ex-wife, who

42:01.419 --> 42:04.321
they had had a horrible relationship

42:04.355 --> 42:06.891
and she was very bitter
at him because of that.

42:06.924 --> 42:09.794
And Walter tells Inez that in return

42:09.827 --> 42:13.931
for her helping pin
the murders on Alstory Simon

42:13.964 --> 42:16.934
David Protess is not just gonna
get Walter out of prison

42:16.967 --> 42:19.770
he's gonna get Inez's son

42:19.804 --> 42:22.640
Sonny out of prison as well.

42:22.673 --> 42:24.341
He said, "What do you expect me to do?"

42:24.375 --> 42:25.543
And these guys are saying

42:25.576 --> 42:27.244
they'll help me get out of prison.

42:27.277 --> 42:29.146
I'll say whatever they want me to say.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.315
So I made up all that stuff about Al.

42:31.348 --> 42:33.618
Confessing to us and telling us that

42:33.651 --> 42:36.020
and, uh, so it was all a story.

42:36.053 --> 42:39.824
So it was actually hatched
by Anthony Porter from prison.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.225
Then, we tracked down

42:41.258 --> 42:44.361
the ex-wife of the person
we thought was the real killer.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.565
And she told us on video,
that she had been

42:47.598 --> 42:49.767
there when her husband
committed the crime.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.101
David Protess and his students

42:51.135 --> 42:52.837
took Inez Jackson to a restaurant.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.440
They bought her groceries
and a space heater.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.374
Later they went to
Shawn Armbrust's house

42:57.408 --> 43:00.044
in suburban Milwaukee where Inez Jackson

43:00.077 --> 43:02.212
gave a video taped statement

43:02.246 --> 43:05.516
stating that Alstory Simon
killed Jerry and Marilyn.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.659
And she gives, as a reason that

43:14.692 --> 43:17.027
Jerry Hillard was a fellow gang member.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.997
He was holding back on drug money.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.905
Then, a fight ensued.
Then, he pulled out a gun.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.674
Shot Hillard intentionally

43:29.707 --> 43:32.209
and shot Marilyn Green accidentally.

43:36.714 --> 43:37.848
You heard at least 2, right?

43:37.882 --> 43:39.249
- Hmm.
- Okay.

43:39.283 --> 43:43.588
There's 4 people
at that pool that night.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.591
3 males, 1 female.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.461
Not one single person said

43:50.495 --> 43:52.930
2 males, 2 females.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.865
Which would have been
Northwestern's theory that

43:54.899 --> 43:57.167
Simon was there with Inez Jackson

43:57.201 --> 43:58.769
at the time of the shooting.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.705
There was only one female involved here

44:00.738 --> 44:02.473
and that was the victim.

44:02.507 --> 44:05.442
No one ever mentions me
the name of Alstory Simon.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.588
We went to Milwaukee

44:17.622 --> 44:20.324
to contact Inez Jackson.

44:20.357 --> 44:22.760
We had a lot of tough questions for her.

44:22.793 --> 44:25.129
She didn't know what time
the murders occurred.

44:30.768 --> 44:32.603
And that them shooting didn't
take place till

44:32.637 --> 44:34.639
between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning.

44:34.672 --> 44:39.877
That there were only 2 shots fired
uh, one at... at each person.

44:39.910 --> 44:43.313
Totally inconsistent with
what's in the police reports

44:43.347 --> 44:45.916
that the victims were shot 5 times.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.752
You heard 2 shots, right?

44:47.785 --> 44:48.919
3.

44:48.953 --> 44:51.455
- You heard 3 shots?
- Mayb...

44:51.488 --> 44:54.158
It happened so fast.
I heard bang, bang, bang.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.326
It might been another bang, It would...

44:56.360 --> 44:57.762
Well, how many shots did you hear?

44:57.795 --> 45:00.330
Really, maybe 3, maybe 4, I don't know.

45:02.733 --> 45:05.603
You did not say in that
videotape statement

45:05.636 --> 45:08.138
that you heard 3 or 4 shots, did you?

45:08.172 --> 45:10.675
I said I heard

45:10.708 --> 45:14.545
2 shots maybe 3.
He wrote down 2.

45:14.579 --> 45:17.081
But in the videotape statement,
you didn't say...

45:17.114 --> 45:18.949
I said I heard some shots.

45:18.983 --> 45:21.518
You didn't say you heard 3 or
4 shots, did you?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.420
You said you heard 2 shots.

45:23.453 --> 45:24.889
I don't remember.

45:30.460 --> 45:34.498
And she was gonna stick
with that story until

45:34.531 --> 45:36.867
she found out that she was gonna die.

45:40.437 --> 45:43.507
In 2005, Inez Jackson admitted

45:43.540 --> 45:46.510
the whole Simon story was a lie.

45:46.543 --> 45:49.780
And for at least
half an hour on that videotape

45:49.814 --> 45:53.383
time and again she asserts 2 things.

45:53.417 --> 45:56.086
1, she lied, and Alstory Simon

45:56.120 --> 45:58.122
was not the trigger man that night.

46:04.795 --> 46:06.363
The only reason why

46:06.396 --> 46:10.701
she gave that information was
because she was mad at me

46:10.735 --> 46:12.436
for walking out of the marriage

46:12.469 --> 46:14.571
and she saw a chance to get back.

46:20.911 --> 46:23.914
And the promises they had
made about her son

46:23.948 --> 46:26.483
and to help her nephew get out of jail.

46:43.801 --> 46:48.405
She had been promised all
kinds of favors from Protess.

46:48.438 --> 46:51.976
Including money
in exchange for her testimony.

47:06.390 --> 47:09.259
This wasn't the first time
a witness had made allegations

47:09.293 --> 47:11.461
about money from movie and book deals.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.163
Charles McCraney

47:13.197 --> 47:16.033
the star witness in the Four
Heights Four case had made

47:16.066 --> 47:19.636
similar allegations against
David Protess in that case.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.172
That might have been hard
to believe if Protess hadn't

47:22.206 --> 47:24.742
put these promises in writing.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.711
It reads as follows.

47:26.744 --> 47:31.081
"Stopped by to see you about
something important."

47:31.115 --> 47:36.787
"Have information for you that
should be helpful financially."

47:36.821 --> 47:39.056
Financially is underlined.

47:39.089 --> 47:40.557
Then...

47:40.590 --> 47:43.894
On Northwestern
University Evanston, Illinois

47:43.928 --> 47:47.932
Medill School of Journalism stationery

47:47.965 --> 47:50.167
he writes another letter.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.470
"Dear Charlie," and I'm simply
reading a portion of this.

47:53.503 --> 47:57.742
"I could go on and on,
but I think you get the point."

47:57.775 --> 48:01.678
"I easily can write this book
based on your various statements

48:01.712 --> 48:04.314
which frankly would make you look bad

48:04.348 --> 48:07.718
or you could be courageous
by telling your real story

48:07.752 --> 48:10.254
about what happened in this case."

48:10.287 --> 48:12.857
"You don't have much longer to wait."

48:12.890 --> 48:15.760
"I'm moving ahead with my investigation

48:15.793 --> 48:19.229
and book, and the movie
is sure to follow."

48:20.664 --> 48:23.868
Protess wrote a book called
"Gone In The Night",

48:23.901 --> 48:26.670
and a CBS movie did follow.

48:26.703 --> 48:28.839
It premiered a month before Protess

48:28.873 --> 48:30.741
wrote the McCraney letters.

48:32.542 --> 48:33.911
Mrs. Nathan?

48:33.944 --> 48:35.579
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm David Protess.

48:35.612 --> 48:37.047
I sent you a letter.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.749
Charles McCraney told
private investigators

48:38.783 --> 48:40.184
that David Protess

48:40.217 --> 48:44.054
promised him $250,000
from movie and book deals.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.991
And the way Protess describes
that encounter

48:47.024 --> 48:49.994
in his own book is to say that

48:50.027 --> 48:52.062
Protess introduced Ciolino

48:52.096 --> 48:55.532
to the witness Charles
McCraney as Jerry Bruckheimer

48:55.565 --> 49:00.404
a Hollywood producer,
and then Ciolino told McCraney

49:00.437 --> 49:02.439
"If you're willing to tell your story

49:02.472 --> 49:04.141
it could be worth something."

49:04.174 --> 49:07.244
And McCraney said, "How about
start paying for my time?"

49:07.277 --> 49:10.114
And Ciolino then pulled out
a gold money clip

49:10.147 --> 49:11.916
peeled off 4 crisp 20s

49:11.949 --> 49:13.951
and tossed them on the table.

49:13.984 --> 49:17.154
But you did, for instance,
pay Charles McCraney

49:17.187 --> 49:19.689
or Mr. Ciolino did, 80 or $100
to meet with him

49:19.723 --> 49:21.758
at a Kentucky Fried Chicken, right?

49:23.894 --> 49:26.997
As to the question pertaining to me

49:27.031 --> 49:29.099
the answer is no, I did not.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.936
Mr. Ciolino paid him
for his time, right?

49:31.969 --> 49:34.171
Shocked the shit out of me
when it happened.

49:34.204 --> 49:36.907
But he's part of your team, isn't he?

49:36.941 --> 49:39.209
Right, but I don't control Paul Ciolino

49:39.243 --> 49:41.045
the same way he doesn't control me.

49:41.078 --> 49:43.113
Right, but if you were there,
you were there with him, right?

49:43.147 --> 49:44.448
Objection.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.550
So that seems to me
to be part of their MO.

49:46.583 --> 49:49.820
They go to impoverished people
who don't have a lot of money

49:49.854 --> 49:51.621
and make them promises

49:51.655 --> 49:53.924
and basically get them to recant.

50:13.777 --> 50:17.481
After she, uh, did that declaration, um

50:17.514 --> 50:20.784
a month or 2 months later, she died.

50:21.818 --> 50:23.520
There is no evidence today

50:23.553 --> 50:26.223
because everybody's recanted
in this case.

50:26.256 --> 50:28.092
The only evidence holding

50:28.125 --> 50:29.860
Alstory Simon in prison

50:29.894 --> 50:31.061
was his confession.

50:31.095 --> 50:33.197
And a week later, her husband confessed

50:33.230 --> 50:36.733
to private investigator
Paul Ciolino on video.

50:45.775 --> 50:47.211
There was a time when

50:47.244 --> 50:48.845
people believed that

50:48.879 --> 50:50.747
innocent people
did not confess to crimes.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.582
And I was among those people.

50:52.616 --> 50:55.986
Everybody in our field now knows
that that's not the case.

50:56.020 --> 51:00.824
The original "Innocence Project"
was formed in New York in 1992.

51:00.857 --> 51:06.030
Its website lists the telltale
signs of a false confession.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.732
If you take those factors
and apply them to this case

51:08.765 --> 51:10.600
they're almost all present.

51:12.436 --> 51:14.338
February '99

51:14.371 --> 51:17.474
I had been sitting up about
3 days and nights smoking

51:17.507 --> 51:21.045
rock cocaine and, um, the doorbell rang.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.312
It kept ringing and ringing

51:22.346 --> 51:24.048
you know, like somebody was in distress.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.483
Alstory Simon was approached

51:26.516 --> 51:29.753
at 6:30 in the morning after
he had spent the night

51:29.786 --> 51:33.390
doing cocaine,
so he was clearly intoxicated.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.492
When I opened the door

51:35.525 --> 51:37.527
here's Paul Ciolino

51:37.561 --> 51:39.329
and Arnold Reed.

51:39.363 --> 51:41.331
They was armed with weapons

51:41.365 --> 51:45.835
and had a video camera
and a tripod and badges.

51:45.869 --> 51:49.139
They claimed to be police
investigators from Chicago

51:49.173 --> 51:51.875
investigating a 1982 homicide.

51:51.908 --> 51:54.644
And bogarted their way
on into the house.

51:54.678 --> 51:57.181
The investigator in this case, as he was

51:57.214 --> 51:59.183
in the Four Nights Four case

51:59.216 --> 52:02.086
was Paul Ciolino, a private investigator

52:02.119 --> 52:05.589
who works hand in glove
with Professor Protess.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.692
And he just pushed me on, you
know, back up in the house.

52:08.725 --> 52:11.661
Like police do when they coming
to make an arrest.

52:11.695 --> 52:15.099
They pushed me and shoved me
into a corner part

52:15.132 --> 52:17.167
of where the sofa was.

52:17.201 --> 52:19.003
He stood over me

52:19.036 --> 52:22.872
and Arnold Reed, he started
going from room to room.

52:22.906 --> 52:25.109
I'm asking him, "What are you
walking all through my house for?"

52:25.142 --> 52:27.611
"Wh... what are you looking for?"

52:27.644 --> 52:31.581
So, Ciolino, he tells me, uh

52:31.615 --> 52:33.517
"We know you did these murders."

52:33.550 --> 52:35.485
"You're going down for these murders."

52:35.519 --> 52:37.921
"And there's nothing you're
gonna be able to do about it."

52:37.954 --> 52:40.757
I'm telling them, "Man, I don't know
nothing about no murders, man."

52:40.790 --> 52:42.392
"What are you talking about?"

52:42.426 --> 52:44.461
I said, "Man, just get out
of my house, man."

52:44.494 --> 52:46.296
He said, "No, we're not going anywhere."

52:46.330 --> 52:48.465
"You better look at the evidence."

52:48.498 --> 52:50.867
"And I'm gonna show you this is
why we think you did it."

52:50.900 --> 52:55.372
So he showed me affidavits
of some people.

52:55.405 --> 52:57.974
He showed Alstory Simon the
statement that Walter Jackson

52:58.008 --> 53:00.777
had made claiming that
Alstory Simon had admitted

53:00.810 --> 53:03.747
the crime to him 17 years earlier.

53:03.780 --> 53:06.850
Alstory Simon said, "That's ridiculous.
Get out of my house."

53:06.883 --> 53:10.187
Ciolino then pulled out a video camera.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.122
He popped this tape in.

53:12.156 --> 53:14.858
Here's this Afro-American male person

53:14.891 --> 53:17.361
up there on this tape claiming that

53:17.394 --> 53:20.797
he was at Washington Park
and actually saw me shoot

53:20.830 --> 53:23.667
and kill Marilyn Green
and Jerry Hillard.

53:24.701 --> 53:27.904
And then, uh...

53:27.937 --> 53:30.207
Alstory Simon did not know

53:30.240 --> 53:34.378
that this African-American
making these allegations

53:34.411 --> 53:38.348
on this videotape was an actor

53:38.382 --> 53:40.217
hired by Ciolino

53:40.250 --> 53:42.719
and scripted by Ciolino.

53:42.752 --> 53:44.621
He tells me, uh,

53:44.654 --> 53:46.923
"I want you to see something."

53:46.956 --> 53:49.093
He goes to the TV

53:49.126 --> 53:52.529
that I had on,
and he turns to a channel.

53:52.562 --> 53:57.401
And there was this professor,
accusing me of murder.

53:59.503 --> 54:05.742
It showed my ex-wife Inez
accusing me of murder

54:05.775 --> 54:08.712
and being with me and
supposed to observed me

54:08.745 --> 54:10.680
me shooting and killing these people.

54:19.489 --> 54:20.957
I couldn't believe it.

54:20.990 --> 54:23.293
At a certain point your story came on

54:23.327 --> 54:25.129
and he watched,
and it confirmed everything

54:25.162 --> 54:27.897
I had been telling him earlier
in our conversation.

54:27.931 --> 54:31.000
And it just seemed at
that moment, he gave up.

54:31.034 --> 54:32.636
I knew she had, uh,

54:32.669 --> 54:36.706
turned bad, but... just completely.

54:36.740 --> 54:40.477
I became fearful of my life though.

54:40.510 --> 54:45.249
Then after, he says, uh,
"Look, Alstory, um,

54:45.282 --> 54:49.553
we got all the evidence we need
to put you on death row."

54:50.454 --> 54:52.322
"I'm gonna level with you."

54:52.356 --> 54:55.925
"We're not police officers."

54:55.959 --> 54:57.761
I said, "What?"

54:57.794 --> 54:59.663
He said,
"No, we're not police officers."

54:59.696 --> 55:03.600
We're investigators working
for the same person

55:03.633 --> 55:07.137
that you just seen on the screen,
Professor Protess."

55:07.171 --> 55:09.839
So I said, "Well, get the hell
out of my house."

55:10.907 --> 55:12.476
They refused to leave.

55:13.877 --> 55:18.515
And he said, "Look, all we
wanna do is stop this execution."

55:18.548 --> 55:21.651
And then to create
the urgency they told him that

55:21.685 --> 55:24.621
you only have a half hour
to help yourself.

55:24.654 --> 55:27.391
If you don't say that you did
this crime in self-defense

55:27.424 --> 55:29.759
in the next half hour,
the Chicago police

55:29.793 --> 55:31.928
are gonna walk in here, arrest you

55:31.961 --> 55:34.030
take you downtown,
and there's nothing anybody

55:34.063 --> 55:37.000
can do to help you.
This is your only opportunity.

55:37.033 --> 55:38.768
Then he tells me, uh,

55:38.802 --> 55:41.738
if you... if I cooperate with him

55:41.771 --> 55:45.509
he'll make sure that it was
a self-defense murder.

55:46.876 --> 55:51.848
And when he said that,
he made me feel like he was

55:51.881 --> 55:54.218
trying to give me a way out.

55:54.251 --> 55:56.720
And he told me that, um,

55:56.753 --> 56:00.357
I would be paid financially well off.

56:00.390 --> 56:05.028
That I'd never have to work
again if I cooperated with them.

56:05.061 --> 56:09.333
And I asked him, I said,
"Man, are you fucking serious?"

56:09.366 --> 56:11.801
You know.
Excuse my language. Oh.

56:11.835 --> 56:16.005
And he said, "Look, you can play
hardball all you want.

56:16.039 --> 56:18.442
"But I'm telling you
you're going to death row

56:18.475 --> 56:20.710
and there's nothing
you can do about it."

56:20.744 --> 56:23.713
But I tell him that
I didn't murder anybody.

56:23.747 --> 56:25.815
He puts his hand on his gun, you know,

56:25.849 --> 56:27.584
and started easing it up.

56:27.617 --> 56:29.453
Like this, and tells me that,

56:29.486 --> 56:31.388
"Hey, we can do this the easy way

56:31.421 --> 56:33.890
or we can do this the hard way."

56:33.923 --> 56:38.962
You know, being souped up
on that drugs and alcohol...

56:38.995 --> 56:40.664
And I was paranoid.

56:40.697 --> 56:44.434
And I'm thinking, when he said
the easy way or the hard way

56:44.468 --> 56:47.437
that he's gonna shoot me in
my head and make it look like

56:47.471 --> 56:51.140
that he come to question
a... a murder suspect

56:51.174 --> 56:54.844
and I maybe open fire on them,
and he had to kill me, you know,

56:54.878 --> 56:58.548
and all this kind of stuff
was going through my head.

56:58.582 --> 57:01.117
So again, I tell him
to get out of my house.

57:01.150 --> 57:02.919
So I tried to get up

57:02.952 --> 57:04.888
to get to the phone

57:04.921 --> 57:07.991
to call Milwaukee authorities.

57:08.024 --> 57:11.995
Arnold Reed, he blocked me
from using the phone.

57:12.028 --> 57:14.564
You know, he put his hand on the phone

57:14.598 --> 57:17.401
and pulled his gun out,
you know, literally.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.003
So I sat back down.

57:20.036 --> 57:23.740
Then, Ciolino, he tells me

57:23.773 --> 57:28.578
if you cooperate with us,
we guarantee you that

57:28.612 --> 57:31.948
you will come out of this
with millions of dollars.

57:31.981 --> 57:34.918
That the money will come
from movies and book deals

57:34.951 --> 57:36.853
and all of this kind of stuff.

57:36.886 --> 57:40.424
That Professor Protess will pull
the necessary strings

57:40.457 --> 57:42.692
to get you released
in a couple of years.

57:42.726 --> 57:44.961
You only have to do a few years.

57:44.994 --> 57:47.864
All we want is to stop this execution.

57:47.897 --> 57:50.734
Now, I'm, uh, scared to death

57:50.767 --> 57:54.170
after what I done saw on this TV screen.

57:54.203 --> 57:57.574
I wanted the man out of my house so bad

57:57.607 --> 58:00.744
and I asked him, I said, "Well,
what do you want me to do?"

58:00.777 --> 58:04.080
So he picked up the papers
that he showed me.

58:04.113 --> 58:07.116
He started writing stuff
on a piece of paper

58:07.150 --> 58:09.753
and underlining different
stuff and then told me

58:09.786 --> 58:12.021
I want you to say this on camera.

58:12.055 --> 58:15.492
Ciolino basically used Walter
Jackson's affidavit

58:15.525 --> 58:18.462
as a template for
Alstory Simon's confession.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.331
So we rehearsed it.

58:21.365 --> 58:24.334
Oh, man, for a long time.

58:24.368 --> 58:26.936
Alright, that's 'cause
that's how out of it I was.

58:26.970 --> 58:29.673
And then, uh, when he felt that I had it

58:29.706 --> 58:32.542
down pack and sound convincing enough

58:32.576 --> 58:34.143
we put it on camera.

59:40.243 --> 59:43.079
His demeanor, I thought, was very, uh,

59:43.112 --> 59:47.183
telling in that he was looking
at his shoes most of the time.

59:47.216 --> 59:49.919
And, uh, he looked like he was prepped.

59:49.953 --> 59:52.589
And while I was talking,
I had the paper, you know

59:52.622 --> 59:55.091
right next to me on the cocktail table.

59:55.124 --> 59:57.494
So if I forget something, you know

59:57.527 --> 59:58.695
I could look at it, you know

59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.363
and say what he wanted me to say.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.849
And then he told me that
the only person who would see

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:22.018
that would be the prosecution.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:24.621
This tape of Alstory Simon's confession

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:27.591
didn't go straight to the
prosecutors, it went to CBS.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.258
It was aired on television.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:32.796
Newscasters were calling
for Anthony Porter's release

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:37.066
without there being
any scrutiny of the confession.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.135
Thomas Epach, then the head

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:42.171
of the Cook County State's
Attorney's criminal division

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:46.175
claims Simon's prosecution
has haunted him for years.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.278
In 2013, he swore an affidavit

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.815
sharing some of the inside story.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.416
"Less than 2 days after the video

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:56.720
"of the alleged confession
was broadcast by the media

01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:58.287
"State's Attorney, Richard Devine

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.525
"made the decision to release
Mr. Porter from custody.

01:01:01.558 --> 01:01:03.326
"At the time this decision was made

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.028
"no one from
the state's attorney's office

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:08.464
"had received a copy
of the original video

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:12.235
which purported to contain the
confession of Alstory Simon."

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.938
The state released
Porter without even having

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:17.340
the confession tape in their possession.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:20.443
They basically just swung the
doors open for Anthony Porter.

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.546
With no scrutiny at all.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.914
"In my years of
experience as a prosecutor

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:28.652
"it is my opinion
that it was highly unusual

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:32.088
"if not unprecedented,
to make a decision to release

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.357
"an individual convicted of murder

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.360
"based upon the broadcast of a video

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.896
"the reliability and authenticity

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:42.766
"of which had not been
thoroughly investigated

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.333
and established."

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:47.270
And when Ciolino was asked by the, uh,

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:50.506
Chicago media in 2006

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.543
to address Alstory Simon's allegations

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:55.712
this is what Ciolino's response was.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.146
I don't have any rules.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.716
The Supreme Court says I can
lie, cheat, do anything I can

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.351
to get them to say whatever
I got to get them to say.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.453
The Chicago Police Department
is masters at it.

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:06.189
So is every other police department.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:09.325
And at one point,
in a Chicago magazine article

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.194
he acknowledges that he

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:16.499
quote, bull-rushed
this client into confessing.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:21.404
"We just bull-rushed him and
mentally he couldn't recover."

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:23.873
Ciolino acknowledges
that he used an actor.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.842
He acknowledges
that he scripted the actor.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:30.013
But he denies flatly
that he ever promised favors

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.514
or that he ever threatened him.

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:34.550
The turning point was when
Alstory Simon was confronted

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.452
with massive evidence of his guilt.

01:02:36.485 --> 01:02:39.322
Uh, he was shown the
affidavits and the videotapes

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.257
uh, that proved that he was guilty.

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.392
I asked David Protess about this

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:47.130
fake videotape when I took his
deposition in another case.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:50.734
It is a criticism of Paul Ciolino's

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.936
uh, method of using, I believe

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:56.806
a fake videotape in
an interview that he conducted.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.908
I would never do that.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.509
- You didn't know he was gonna do that?
- Nope.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:04.013
In David Protess' grand jury
testimony, he testified

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:06.683
"I learned a day or two
before Mr. Ciolino interviewed

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.818
"Alstory Simon that he was thinking

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:10.954
about using this technique."

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.322
- You didn't know he was gonna do that?
- Nope.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:17.627
Northwestern David Protess
would be the first people

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:22.031
screaming about the tactics
of the Chicago Police Department

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:24.500
in coercing confessions out of people.

01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:28.537
But why in the world,
when that behavior is wrong

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:32.408
would Ciolino say
he can do whatever he wants

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.143
to get a confession out of somebody

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:37.546
and to get them to say
what he wants them to say.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.217
And he has no rules
like police officers do.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.787
When I heard what Alstory
Simon said there was no doubt

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.489
in my mind that Alstory
was telling the truth

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.792
because I had experienced

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:52.495
the same thing
first-hand with Paul Ciolino.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.330
Michael Madonia
was involved in litigation

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.632
with one of Paul Ciolino's clients.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.934
Paul Ciolino paid a visit

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.169
to Mr. Madonia at his home.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.571
He started pounding
on the door of my house

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.941
and then after that
he was gonna push his way in.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:08.444
I had to put my arm up to
stop him from entering my home.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:11.314
He said that if I continued
to collect evidence

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.316
that there would be a good likelihood

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:16.352
that I would end up
with a bullet in my head.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:20.724
Sometimes you can
be placed in a situation

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:24.794
and do something that
you really don't wanna do.

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:29.232
But compelled to do it for the
sake of saving your own life.

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:32.435
One expert outlines the factors

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.971
that lead to false confessions.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.573
"What happened prior to the confession?"

01:04:37.606 --> 01:04:39.508
"Are there Miranda issues?"

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.278
"Was the client clean and sober?"

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:44.213
"Was anybody other than sworn

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.483
law enforcement personnel involved?"

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.485
"Are there any issues of inappropriate

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.220
physical misconduct?"

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:55.258
That expert is
none other than Paul Ciolino.

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:58.027
I strongly believed and felt

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.695
that I wouldn't have had a chance

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.066
to sit on death row, no 5 years.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.101
Not even no 5 months.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.837
I believe they would've
killed me immediately.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:09.873
And then the key is he told them

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.008
"And I'll get you a lawyer.
We'll take care of that."

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:15.578
Because the only way this was
gonna work is if they made sure

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.446
that Simon had a lawyer who wasn't

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.982
really gonna represent him.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:27.156
He also told me that
they was gonna furnish me

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:31.560
with the best defense attorney
in the city of Chicago.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:35.765
He went to my phone, he made a call.

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:39.102
He told me that Attorney Jack Rimland

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.970
would be representing me.

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:43.940
Then, they packed up and left.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:47.576
Attorney Rimland came to
my house, introduced himself.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.914
We sat down.
Gave me one of his cards.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.984
He didn't appear to be concerned
about what had happened.

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:58.287
And I had told Rimland that

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.756
"Man, I didn't do these murders, man."

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:05.161
And then he told me that, well,
it didn't make no difference.

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:08.364
Because the evidence
was so strong against me

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:13.102
that if I rolled the dice
that I'm going to death row.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.738
That was the extent of, uh, his visit.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:19.208
Ciolino got the confession
and then handed him over

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:22.578
to his office mate
and his own personal attorney

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.681
to represent him and tell him
that he had to plead guilty.

01:06:25.714 --> 01:06:30.753
That lawyer's job was
to scrutinize the confession

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:33.656
that Ciolino had taken
from Alstory Simon.

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.158
Now, how is a lawyer

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.926
who is close friends with

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.862
the person who took the confession

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:41.430
gonna scrutinize that confession?

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:45.168
The first thing he did
was to announce publicly

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:48.537
that he understood that if
Alstory Simon was charged

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.739
that he would be facing
the death penalty.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:54.343
Which is almost exactly what
Paul Ciolino told Alstory Simon

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:56.846
to get him to confess
in the first place.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.447
The only promise I made to him was

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.317
I would try and make sure he
did not get the death penalty.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.452
Shortly after Simon confessed

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:06.055
he called his friend,
Reverend Robert Braun.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:08.591
Braun and Simon had worked together

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:10.526
on many community projects.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.662
I said, "Al, you gotta
tell me what went on," you know.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.164
"What's going on?'

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.732
"What's this about a confession?"

01:07:16.765 --> 01:07:18.601
And... and he says,
"My mind ain't right."

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:20.103
He's like, "I couldn't think."

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.005
And he said, "I said a lot of stuff

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.207
"and they're gonna get me
the electric chair, Bob."

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.911
I said, "No they won't."
Al says, "Yes, they will."

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:31.080
Simon told Braun that he
was innocent of the crime

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:34.017
but that Jack Rimland
advised him to plead guilty

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.851
as part of the deal.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:40.089
He said, "Bob, I'm taking
care of this. Back off."

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:43.859
I said, "Al said that he's...
He's innocent of all this

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:46.229
"why are you telling him
to plead guilty?"

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.898
Rimland also told Braun that Simon

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:52.101
would only serve 2 years
in jail as part of the deal.

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:53.536
I says, I don't believe that.

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.039
Uh, I'm worried about
him pleading guilty

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.507
if it involves something
to do with murder.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:01.344
And Bob told me
to get rid of this attorney.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.879
That Rimland wasn't
doing nothing, you know,

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.082
far as exercising my rights.

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:07.516
And to get rid of him

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.752
and I should've listened
to him, you know.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.355
He ordered me to stay away from Al.

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.057
He didn't want me near Al.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.325
Rimland knew, at one point

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.328
that I was thinking
about going to trial.

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:21.729
And I told him, "Man, I've been
doing some thinking

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:25.301
since I was at
the police station, locked in."

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.502
And I'm going out here

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:28.437
I'm telling the judge every damn thing.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.073
What they did to me and all this

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.008
and how it came about being up here.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:35.144
Rimland clearly panics.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:39.215
To further coerce
Simon into pleading guilty

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:42.185
Rimland told him that he was

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:46.055
a very strong suspect in another
murder up in Milwaukee.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:47.890
And that he could get the death penalty

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:51.127
either in Milwaukee or in Chicago.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.196
And I asked him, "Man, are you serious?

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.131
What... what are you talking about?"

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:57.700
And so soon as he left,
bam, there it was

01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:00.736
the... the story popped up
on the TV screen.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:04.307
Me being the mastermind
about this Milwaukee murder.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.676
I was already kind of afraid
to go to trial in many respects

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:11.147
because I felt that if I did go to trial

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.017
I would get found guilty
because of all the publicity

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.818
that had been on the case.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:18.587
There was no charges pending against Al.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:20.756
The state's attorney in Milwaukee said

01:09:20.788 --> 01:09:23.459
they don't have
anything on Alstory Simon.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.429
He's not involved
in the case up in Milwaukee.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.763
It was all a lie.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.966
A ruse to get him
to confess to the Porter murder.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.868
And then he tells me that there's

01:09:33.902 --> 01:09:35.770
a plea deal on the table.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:39.042
That if I'd plead guilty to 40 years

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:43.511
they would give me immunity
from prosecution from Milwaukee

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:47.015
and there will be no death
penalty and no life in prison.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:51.319
At the sentencing hearing,
Simon stuck to the plan

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:55.091
and apologized to Offie Green,
the mother of Marilyn Green.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:07.570
I made the apology
on the advice of counsel.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:11.006
He said that it would
be more helpful to apologize

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.210
and that... that should make things

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.412
sound more convincing.

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:17.813
You know, if you believe it or not

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:20.616
that that was true,
when I'm reading through

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.851
all his documents, I find this letter

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.622
where Rimland actually
states that and the letter

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:29.358
advised Al that this reporter was gonna

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.394
come down and interview him
about the case.

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:36.565
It urges Al to remember to apologize

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:39.268
and show remorse towards the family

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:41.837
when she comes down there
and talks to you.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.239
Which he did.

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:46.275
And doing those 3 to 4 weeks, I would

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:49.678
rehearse on what I was going to say.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:54.850
Alstory turns around, telling
the victim's mother

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:59.255
that Marilyn,
unfortunately, got in the way

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:03.592
as he was wielding the gun
and accidentally shot her.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.262
But that doesn't go with the facts.

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.597
Her daughter was shot 3 times.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.998
So it wasn't an accident.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.801
And he was standing within 2 feet of her

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.837
when he... when he fired those rounds.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.273
So whoever killed her was

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:21.644
intentionally trying
to kill her and shot 3 times.

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:24.880
It was the most hardest
and mental painful thing

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.982
that I had to experience.

01:11:27.015 --> 01:11:30.686
Knowing the fact that
I'm standing up here innocent

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:34.790
and I'm apologizing
to this girl's mother

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.860
when I had nothing to
do with her daughter's death.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.231
At the conclusion of Simon's hearing

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:43.966
Assistant State's Attorney

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:47.603
Thomas Gainer presented the
facts of the case to the judge.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.873
But misrepresented
the grand jury testimony

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.742
of almost every key witness.

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:57.413
Gainer tells the judge that
he would call 3 other witnesses.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.915
Senior, Woodfork, and Beckwith.

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:02.050
What he doesn't
tell the judge that those

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:05.120
3 witnesses would
all implicate Anthony Porter.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.257
And Rimland stood there
and never said a word.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.593
And he makes no
mention of Kenneth Edwards

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.561
who's the most important witness of all.

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:16.532
Who actually said that he saw
Porter shoot the victims.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:19.735
Witness after witness
after witness was brought in

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.239
to establish that Anthony Porter
committed this murder.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:26.742
And then somewhere along
the line in the grand jury

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:29.878
it was obvious that
a decision had been made

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:33.349
that they were going
to embrace Porter's innocence

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:36.319
and go after Alstory Simon and in fact

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:39.388
embrace this alleged
confession to Ciolino.

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:42.825
Thomas Epach concluded that based on

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:46.262
the evidence against Porter, the
involvement of Paul Ciolino

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.431
in obtaining the purported confession

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:51.934
and the representation of
Simon by an attorney with ties

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:55.371
to Ciolino and Protess,
I believed that questions

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:58.241
remained about the guilt
of Simon and the innocence

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:01.877
of Porter that needed
to be fully investigated.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:05.013
"I expressed these
concerns to Mr. Devine.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:08.217
"Subsequently, I was told
that the decision to prosecute

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:12.388
"Alstory Simon had
been made by Mr. Devine."

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:15.791
Devine tells WBBM that's
not the way he remembers it.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:19.127
If Mr. Epach had these, uh, issues

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:23.131
I don't recall him, uh,
ever raising them with me.

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:26.068
Maybe he raised them
with, uh, with other people.

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:28.170
Uh, that's possible, but, uh,

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:29.705
I don't recall
them being raised with me.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:32.275
Devine said he
does believe Simon's claims

01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:35.110
should be looked at and evaluated.

01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:38.213
My view is that
the Cook County prosecutors

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.249
did not want to be on the receiving end

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:42.318
of any more negative publicity.

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:44.186
The Cook County state's
attorney's office

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.455
didn't want to
be embarrassed and go back

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:50.626
on what they had already set in
motion by reacting too quickly

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.528
so they made a political decision

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:56.299
to move forward with the
prosecution of Alstory Simon.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:14:00.235
Richard Devine convened
grand jury number 363

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:04.973
in February of 1999 in which
witnesses against Porter

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:07.910
and the Northwestern team testified.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.245
The grand jury was not asked to return

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.348
an indictment against Simon.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:16.452
A month later, a second
grand jury was convened.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:20.723
The second grand jury did not
hear from any of the witnesses

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:24.427
implicating Porter in the
murders, hearing only evidence

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.362
regarding Simon's confession

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:30.466
and Inez and Walter Jackson's
statements against Simon.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.435
Based on that one-sided testimony

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:36.805
the second grand jury returned
an indictment against Simon.

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:37.973
I mean, it's an utter outrage.

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:40.175
It's justice upside down.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:42.611
How does Jack Rimland plea him guilty

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.080
to 37 years in prison?

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:48.584
And you're not gonna investigate
the case and expose the case?

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.688
And remember when Simon was
got the sentence that he got,

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:55.524
most of us who were not
paying close enough attention

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:58.694
still thought, well,
that's an awfully good sentence.

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:01.129
I mean, Jack Rimland,
his attorney or whoever he is

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.499
must have done a great job
because Alstory Simon, you know

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.468
he's gonna be out in about 20 years.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.835
Uh, committing a double murder for which

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.804
another guy was sentenced to die.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:11.139
To suggest that he did his job

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.342
by sparing him from the death penalty

01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:14.910
he didn't need any lawyer

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.079
to not face the death penalty.

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:19.314
And armed with
the circumstances surrounding

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:22.618
this confession along
with the grand jury testimony

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:26.054
of several witnesses
who placed Anthony Porter

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.024
at the scene of the murder
at the time it occurred.

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:32.094
A reasonably good
criminal defense lawyer would've

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.530
filed a motion to suppress immediately.

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:38.801
Rimland never told me that
he had a strong relationship

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.736
with Ciolino and Protess.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:43.672
He never told me about he
shared office space with them.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:46.909
He never told me that
they had a business relationship

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.944
and they was all friends.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:52.314
Then, I find out
that while I'm going to trial

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:55.684
and he was my lawyer
at the time he presented awards

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:58.421
to the very same people
who got me in this.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:02.090
Attorney Rimland gave an award

01:16:02.124 --> 01:16:05.728
to David Protess and Paul Ciolino

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:09.832
for their efforts
in freeing Anthony Porter

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.768
and implicating Alstory Simon

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:16.672
while Rimland was still
representing Alstory Simon

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:19.207
before he had even plead to the charges.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.844
And he was my lawyer at the time.

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.747
Soon after Simon
was sentenced, his lawyer

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.615
Jack Rimland sent a letter

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:28.784
concluding their business together.

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:31.787
That's when I begun to understand

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.390
that I had been bamboozled and played.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:39.061
When Simon finally received
the grand jury transcripts

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.996
he realized that Rimland lied

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.466
about the strength
of evidence against him.

01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:46.101
The grand jury investigation
had been secret

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:49.872
from the public
and Simon until this point.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:52.107
I was so furious

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:57.546
because this man
had the thorough evidence

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.483
that proved my actual innocence.

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:04.219
So Alstory Simon filed a
pro se post-conviction petition.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:07.923
When I say pro se, I mean
he's filing that on his own.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:09.424
He wrote it himself.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.860
He's not working with
a lawyer who is telling him

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:14.863
what theories to bring
or anything of that nature.

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:17.399
This is just on his own
sitting in a jail cell.

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:21.504
On July 3, 2001, Simon filed his appeal

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:22.671
with the circuit court.

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:26.108
On October 5th, Judge Evelyn Clay

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.211
dismissed the petition
without a hearing.

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:32.347
With the help of attorneys
Jim Sotos and Terry Ekl

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.850
a successive petition was filed.

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:39.321
But was also rejected by Judge Clay.

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.189
The Chicago media has not embraced

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.925
the story of Alstory Simon

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:46.595
being innocent and having been
framed by Northwestern to get

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.464
Anthony Porter out of jail
to create a poster boy

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.199
for the anti-death penalty movement.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.268
And the reason,
I think is fairly simple.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:56.872
I think they're vested in the
Anthony Porter is innocent story.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.107
And I think they have a hard time

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.243
eating that right now and admitting

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.679
that they were played by David Protess.

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.657
Because Porter wasn't
originally pardoned

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.092
for the armed robbery of Henry Williams

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:20.996
his wrongful imprisonment only
totaled one and a half years.

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.231
This didn't entitle him to much

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:26.401
in automatic state compensation.

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:29.404
Cook County announced
that they were going to continue

01:18:29.437 --> 01:18:33.576
to defend the conviction
of Anthony Porter

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.978
for the robbery of Henry Williams.

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:38.246
The Chicago media didn't like that.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.750
"The Chicago Tribune" did an editorial

01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:43.619
criticizing the decision

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:46.521
and the next day
the state's attorney's office

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.523
dropped those charges too.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.026
The state's attorney's
office decision to keep

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:54.663
the armed robbery charges
in place demonstrated

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:58.500
that they believed that
Williams was telling the truth.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:01.536
The problem with that is
if you do believe that,

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.005
well, then why would you disbelieve him

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.207
when he said he saw Porter
run up into the bleachers

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.842
where the murders occurred?

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.477
There'd be no reason to
distinguish one from the other.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:12.615
And Porter has always
maintained from day one

01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.883
that he was never even in the park.

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:20.222
After Anthony Porter
was released from prison

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.357
he brought a lawsuit
against the city of Chicago

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.860
and several Chicago police officers.

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:28.430
It was one of the most intensive

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:31.700
ventures that I have ever undertaken.

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:33.401
I said, the only way
we're going to do this

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.739
is we gotta take
this apart from the beginning.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:41.610
I want every witness re-interviewed.

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:45.714
Because witnesses make great cases.

01:19:45.748 --> 01:19:47.415
At the end of the civil trial

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.184
Anthony Porter's lawyers asked

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:52.220
the jury to award him $24 million.

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.189
The verdict came in.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:57.259
Porter wouldn't receive a dime.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.796
They awarded him nothing.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.898
The jury rejected that
and returned a verdict

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.132
for the city of Chicago

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.334
and Chicago police officers

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.336
finding that they had probable cause

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:11.506
to arrest Anthony Porter
for the murders.

01:20:11.539 --> 01:20:16.078
The key reasons that we won
were the police officers.

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:19.347
I still get emotional.

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:23.518
This case impacted
so many police officers.

01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:25.821
So many police officers
who were wrongly accused

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:27.589
of having done the wrong thing

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:30.258
by somebody who had done
the wrong thing.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.534
The reporters asked Walter Jones

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:42.504
how could this innocent man
have been denied compensation?

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:45.407
And Jones said, "The real killer
has been sitting in that room

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.409
right there all day."

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:50.445
A bunch of kids from
Northwestern University

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:54.416
who had taken this elective
course, a course on Journalism

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:57.152
and the teacher said why don't
you look into a couple of these.

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.421
The kids dug up
the information that was there

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:01.724
available to the police,
available to the prosecutors

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:04.292
available to the defense, they found it.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:08.831
Ciolino says, "The students
don't investigate shit.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:12.534
"What they do, which is
valuable, is drudge work.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.536
"If anyone thinks they've been getting

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:18.907
"people out of jail, they've
smoked some good shit.

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:20.442
"When Hollywood gets hold of it

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:23.378
the students are going to look
like heroes and geniuses."

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:28.583
I really do not believe
these students had any element

01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:32.487
of malevolence in their work,
I really don't.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.490
David Protess
engineered the investigation

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:38.560
and Paul Ciolino
executed the investigation.

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:41.163
There is now no evidence
against Anthony Porter."

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.866
He's a master at manipulating things.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.303
And he was great
at manipulating the press.

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:51.139
And what I find amazing
is that the journalists

01:21:51.173 --> 01:21:53.909
would write these articles
about the police misconduct

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.944
and how the police
railroaded Anthony Porter

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:57.545
without even looking
at any of the evidence

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:01.249
and, you know, writing like
that destroys the reputations

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:04.586
and careers of officers who dedicated
their whole life to law enforcement.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.423
I was ridiculed.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:10.592
It kind of makes you wonder if you took

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.327
the right career once in a while

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.329
when someone's trying to rail road you

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:17.332
into a different
kind of person than you are.

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:18.934
How did it get twisted around?

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:21.303
How did, you know, it do a 180?

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:24.406
It makes me angry that a killer could be

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.942
walking out free
when they've killed someone.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:30.345
Took someone life
and changed my life forever.

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:36.218
In 2011, Professor Protess was suspended

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.752
from teaching at Northwestern.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.088
And leading the Innocence Project.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.890
The state's attorney's office

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:45.160
asked for documents related to
the case of Anthony McKinney

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.930
who Protess was trying to free.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.632
The University's attorneys
resigned after alleging

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.901
Protess made false statements

01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:55.637
and altered an archived email message.

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:59.407
In an official statement
regarding Protess' suspension

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:03.111
the university wrote,
"In sum, Protess knowingly

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.082
"misrepresented the facts and
his actions to the University

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:09.784
"its attorneys and the dean of Medill

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.020
"on many documented occasions.

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:15.757
"He caused the University to
take on what turned out to be

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.461
"an unsupportable case
and unwittingly misrepresented

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.697
"the situation both to the
Court and to the State."

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:29.104
Protess has since formed
the Chicago Innocence Project

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.906
which isn't officially affiliated

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:33.275
with Northwestern University.

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:35.643
I think people like Protess believe

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.913
the ends justify the means.

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:40.282
That the death penalty is wrong

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:43.518
and whatever you have to do to
convince people it's wrong

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.088
is perfectly acceptable behavior.

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:49.858
I'm sitting here all these years

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:52.494
for something that I didn't do.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:56.999
I missed out on, uh, bonding
with my... my, uh, my nephews

01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:01.336
and I have a grandson
that, uh, I've never seen.

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:06.641
And believe me,
it is... it is mentally painful

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:10.412
to walk around everyday

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.847
locked up for something that you know

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:14.917
that you didn't do.

01:24:15.918 --> 01:24:17.319
You've just gotta say

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.521
time out, do over, right?

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:22.891
Looking back, this does
not meet our standards, um

01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:25.193
and the truth is that every defendant

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.829
from the most innocent
to the most guilty

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.698
deserves to have
an independent attorney.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.168
Who has no ties
to anything else in the case.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:37.973
Whose sole job is to do the best
they can for that client.

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:40.175
Had I known all these particular things

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:42.344
I wouldn't never let him represented me.

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:45.113
You gotta let him change his plea.

01:24:45.147 --> 01:24:47.249
Get a new sentencing
hearing. Get a new trial.

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.816
That's what justice is all about.

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.318
And if it means
that people are embarrassed

01:24:50.352 --> 01:24:52.320
well, it won't be the first time, right?

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:55.590
On October 22, 2013

01:24:55.623 --> 01:25:00.128
the Cook County State's Attorney's
Office stunned Chicago by announcing

01:25:00.162 --> 01:25:02.864
the Porter-Simon case would be reopened.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.302
What would make
this right is my freedom.

01:25:21.183 --> 01:25:22.617
Good afternoon.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.687
This morning, my office
vacated charges of murder

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.291
and voluntary manslaughter
against Alstory Simon

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.625
in connection with the murders

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:33.495
of Jerry Hillard and Marilyn Green.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:36.798
Justice compels that
I take action today.

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:40.202
This case has undoubtedly
been the most complicated

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.670
and the most challenging
re-investigation

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.706
that we have undertaken.

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.941
One of the most significant factors

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.311
that led me to today's decision

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:51.513
was the fact that the original

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.748
re-investigation into this case

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:56.451
was conducted by a former
journalism professor

01:25:56.484 --> 01:26:00.555
a private investigator
employed by that professor

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.957
and a team of young journalism students.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.159
Full name and number.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.393
Alstory Simon.

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:07.829
8-7-0-8-1-7.

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:08.863
You're free to go.

01:26:08.896 --> 01:26:10.665
- Good luck to you.
- Take care.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.138
This investigation
by David Protess and his team

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.474
involved a series of alarming tactics

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:21.409
that were not only coercive

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:25.513
and absolutely unacceptable
by law enforcement standards.

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:28.016
They were potentially
in violation of Mr. Simon's

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:30.185
constitutionally protected rights.

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:33.188
Can you charge, uh, Mr. Ciolino

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.756
or Mr. Protess of anything?

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:37.259
No, I don't believe so because
any statute of limitation

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:39.161
on either obstruction of justice

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.296
or intimidation of
a witness is long gone.

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:45.433
I miss my family... and my mom.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:49.037
She died while I was here.

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:51.506
In my view, the original confession

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:53.341
made by Alstory Simon

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.077
and the coercive tactics

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.912
that were employed
by Investigator Ciolino

01:26:57.945 --> 01:27:00.882
have tainted this case from the outside

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:05.620
and brought into doubt the credibility
of many important factors.

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:08.856
At the end of the day, and in
the best interest of justice

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.326
we could reach no other conclusion

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:13.995
but that the investigation of this case

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.398
has been so deeply corroded

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:18.733
and corrupted that we can no longer

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:21.236
maintain the legitimacy
of his conviction.

01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:23.205
What's next?

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:26.408
Um, whatever
the Lord has in store for me.

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.910
The bottom line
is that the investigation

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:32.046
conducted by Protess and
Private Investigator Ciolino

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.817
as well as the subsequent legal
representation of Mr. Simon

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:38.253
were so flawed that it is clear that

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:40.688
the constitutional rights of Mr. Simon

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.859
were not scrupulously
protected as our law requires.

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:47.829
This conviction,
therefore, cannot stand.

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.572
God is good, ain't he?

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:30.205
No, I'm not angry at the system.

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:32.807
I'm angry at the people
who did what they did to me.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.077
And the situation
that they forced me into.

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.147
Did Porter get a certificate
of actual innocence?

01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:40.915
Is it double jeopardy
that would preclude

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.450
if you were inclined
to go after him again?

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:45.520
He didn't... no, double
jeopardy is attached.

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:47.589
So Anthony Porter's not
looking at any other charges.

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.591
I couldn't even
if I wanted to indict him.

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.759
He actually received
a pardon from the governor.

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:54.095
Simon is at the Jacksonville
Correctional Center

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.497
down in Southern Illinois.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.632
He's being picked up as we speak.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:29:01.236
Will be brought back to the
Chicago land area later today.

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:04.906
Man, this is not...
I'm lost for words.

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:07.942
You know, but I... I feel great, man.

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:11.613
I've been working at it along
with Jim Sotos for 10 years.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.716
And uh, it's just
an extraordinary feeling.

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:18.820
I just thank God, you know,
that, uh, he shined down on me.

01:29:20.255 --> 01:29:21.223
Whoo!

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.860
Free at last! Free at last!

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:31.833
Wow!

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:36.504
And to think that he's
here now standing outside here

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:39.907
a free man is just
unbelievable that this journey

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:44.379
this... this, uh, you know,
is finally coming to an end, um

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:47.915
it's just an amazing story, um,
and it all just went down today.

01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:51.219
Whoa!

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.491
It's all yours.

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:59.361
Can you bag that up,
so I can take it with me?

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.162
I can't eat that.

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:11.339
The food was delicious.

01:30:11.373 --> 01:30:15.777
I'm so full that I can't even
breathe, I can only just blow.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:18.446
That... that lobster, man,
when you were eating that lobster

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.881
it looked like you were in heaven.

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:22.116
I was savoring the moment.

01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:24.786
Every, every, every flavor.

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:30.024
It's too big, man.

01:30:32.327 --> 01:30:35.563
15 years and 8 months.

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.900
The world has changed.

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:41.436
And as a 64-year-old man

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:43.438
I have to adapt to it.

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.874
Now that I'm free...

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:49.411
What about justice for me?

01:30:50.305 --> 01:30:56.214
