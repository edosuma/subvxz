WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.177
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.220 --> 00:04.830
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
I JUST KNOW I HAVE TO GO.

00:04.874 --> 00:07.137
OCTAVIA: IF YOU GO
IN THERE, YOU'LL DIE!

00:07.181 --> 00:09.705
DIYOZA, WAIT!

00:09.748 --> 00:11.272
GABRIEL: OCTAVIA CALLED
YOU HOPE,

00:11.315 --> 00:13.578
THE NAME DIYOZA CHOSE
FOR HER UNBORN CHILD.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.058
ECHO: THEY'RE TAKING
BELLAMY THROUGH,

00:15.102 --> 00:16.407
AND THEY DON'T
WANT US TO FOLLOW.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.930
WE GO THROUGH
TOGETHER.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.454
IF WE'RE EVEN
SECONDS APART,

00:19.497 --> 00:21.412
WE COULD BE SEPARATED
BY MONTHS. OK?

01:51.676 --> 01:53.287
DIYOZA!

01:53.330 --> 01:54.940
DIYOZA, I'M COMING!

01:59.293 --> 02:01.686
DIYOZA: DO IT!
MAKE IT MOVE ALREADY!

02:06.387 --> 02:11.087
OHH. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.524
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU--

02:13.568 --> 02:15.657
-AAGH!
-NO. IT'S TOO SOON.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.615
YOU SAID YOU WERE
ONLY 6 MONTHS.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.705
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 3.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.664
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

02:22.707 --> 02:25.232
I WAS RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

02:25.275 --> 02:30.106
OHH! AAH! OHH!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.369
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.677
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HAPPY I AM YOU'RE HERE.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.462
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO DO THIS ALL ALONE.

02:38.506 --> 02:41.117
-NO.
-NOW PULL THIS LITTLE SPUD OUT,

02:41.161 --> 02:45.730
AND THE 3 OF US CAN
WATCH THE SUNSET TOGETHER.

02:45.774 --> 02:48.080
OOH.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.606
OK. YOU CAN DO THIS.
JUST LOOK AT ME

02:51.649 --> 02:53.521
AND THINK
OF SOMEPLACE ELSE,

02:53.564 --> 02:54.957
A PLACE WHERE
YOU'RE HAPPY.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.741
OH, NOT A LOT
OF CHOICES THERE.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.743
COME ON. YOU CAN
THINK OF SOMEPLACE.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.397
I THINK I'M GONNA
PASS OUT.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.573
-NO WAY.
-WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.358
-JUST LOOK AT ME...
-MM-HMM.

03:04.401 --> 03:08.753
AND...BREATHE.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.842
LET IT GO.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.453
I'M THINKING
OF SOMEPLACE.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.368
GOOD. THAT'S
GOOD FOR YOU.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.283
SOMEPLACE--I WANT TO
PUSH! OHH!

03:16.326 --> 03:20.287
OH, GOD.
IT'S HAPPENING.
IT'S HAPPENING.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.071
-UHHH!
-OK.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.899
COME ON. ONE BIG ONE.
LET'S GO.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.512
YEAH. GOOD.
SHE'S COMING!

03:28.556 --> 03:30.079
GOOD. OK. ONE MORE!

03:30.122 --> 03:33.082
COME ON. AAH!

03:33.125 --> 03:35.084
-ERRRR!
-YES! OHH! OH, MY...

03:36.433 --> 03:38.348
AAH! OHH!

03:38.392 --> 03:40.307
THERE SHE COMES.

03:42.483 --> 03:46.138
OH, DIYOZA.
SHE'S HERE.
SHE'S HERE.

03:46.182 --> 03:50.317
OHH. THIS IS OCTAVIA,
MY FRIEND.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.192
DIYOZA?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.247
OH, GOD.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.557
HERE. HERE.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.129
IT WORKED.
IT WORKED.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.438
JUST LIKE ME.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.659
THANK YOU, BELL.

05:24.193 --> 05:27.196
HOPE: WELCOME TO SKYRING.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.458
ECHO: CREATIVE.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.633
HOPE: I NAMED IT
WHEN I WAS 3.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.896
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.594
SHE REMEMBERS.

05:42.777 --> 05:46.476
MY GUN--I LOST IT
COMING THROUGH.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.609
LET'S HOPE YOU
DON'T NEED IT.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.959
ECHO: HOPE, SLOW DOWN.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:55.093 --> 05:57.400
ECHO: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

05:57.444 --> 05:58.880
DID YOU LIVE HERE?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.403
OCTAVIA SAID
YOU WERE SMART.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.375
WHERE IS IT?

06:27.038 --> 06:28.475
ECHO: HOPE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

06:28.518 --> 06:30.128
INTERESTING TASTE
IN TOYS.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.652
THAT'S NOT MINE.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.393
IS THIS YOUR HOUSE,
OR ISN'T IT?

06:33.436 --> 06:36.787
HOPE: I WAS WITH YOU
ON SANCTUM FOR,
WHAT, A DAY?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.572
GIVEN THE TIME
DIFFERENTIAL,

06:38.615 --> 06:40.138
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.531
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.272
ECHO: ENOUGH!
WE NEED ANSWERS,

06:43.315 --> 06:45.622
STARTING WITH WHERE
THE HELL IS BELLAMY?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.581
ONCE THEY GOT HERE,
THEY USED THE BRIDGE

06:47.624 --> 06:49.452
TO TAKE HIM TO BARDO.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.801
-BARDO?
-THEY?

06:50.845 --> 06:53.674
YES. THE NEXT STOP.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.197
THEY ARE THE DISCIPLES,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.547
THE GUYS THAT WERE
CHASING US IN THE WOODS.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.028
ANDERS SAID IF I
TAGGED OCTAVIA,

07:00.071 --> 07:01.682
THEY WOULD LET
MY MOTHER LIVE.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.944
AND ANDERS IS?

07:05.599 --> 07:09.298
HEAD OF THE DISCIPLES.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.039
NOW. I'M GONNA GO
TO BARDO

07:11.082 --> 07:13.737
AND MAKE SURE
HE KEPT HIS WORD.

07:13.781 --> 07:16.523
ECHO: HEY!

07:16.566 --> 07:20.483
YOU TRADED DIYOZA'S
LIFE FOR OCTAVIA'S?

07:20.527 --> 07:24.313
NO. I WAS NOT
TRYING TO KILL HER.
I TOLD YOU.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.967
IT WAS
A LOCATOR TAG.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.448
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
SHE UNDERSTOOD.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.058
-SHE UNDERSTOOD?
-YES.

07:30.101 --> 07:33.322
MY MOTHER,
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.063
YOU SAID THEY USED
THE BRIDGE.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.500
WELL, I'M ASSUMING THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL THE ANOMALY,

07:37.544 --> 07:40.285
A BRIDGE BETWEEN WORLDS.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.897
IS THERE A WAY
TO CONTROL IT
HERE, TOO?

07:42.940 --> 07:45.552
YES. SHE'S STANDING
ON IT.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.538
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.281
HOPE: I USED TO PLAY
DOWN HERE AS A KID.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.631
LITTLE DID I KNOW
IT WAS A BRIDGE TO THE STARS.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.679
"C.B."

08:25.722 --> 08:27.463
ECHO: SO HOW DO WE
GET TO BARDO?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.552
"TRUST BELLAMY."

08:29.596 --> 08:32.250
GABRIEL: OF COURSE.
YOU HAVE THE CODE.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.776
A FRIEND ON THE INSIDE
GAVE IT TO ME.

08:35.819 --> 08:38.692
NO, NO, NO.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.824
THE CODE, IT'S
WASHED AWAY.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.354
WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.449
OCTAVIA: SHH.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.103
WORK WITH ME.

09:01.932 --> 09:05.153
HERE. AHH!

09:05.196 --> 09:06.937
HOW'D BELLAMY
DO THIS?

09:10.288 --> 09:12.552
OH, GOD.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.944
LOOKS LIKE SHE FIGURED
OUT THAT MILK

09:13.988 --> 09:15.990
DOESN'T COME
FROM A PINKY.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.209
SHOULD YOU BE
WALKING AROUND?

09:18.253 --> 09:21.604
WELL, I JUST SQUEEZED
SOMETHING THE SIZE
OF A WATERMELON

09:21.648 --> 09:24.651
OUT OF SOMETHING
THE SIZE OF A GRAPE.

09:24.694 --> 09:29.438
I'LL SURVIVE. HI.

09:29.481 --> 09:33.921
HELLO, LITTLE PERSON.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.053
SORRY MAMA CONKED OUT
ON YOU BACK THERE.

09:39.187 --> 09:42.059
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN
AGAIN.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.409
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

09:44.453 --> 09:45.889
I LEFT SECONDS
AFTER YOU

09:45.933 --> 09:49.589
BUT GOT HERE MONTHS
LATER. EXPLAIN.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.417
DO I LOOK LIKE
EINSTEIN TO YOU?

09:52.461 --> 09:55.290
NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE
TIME BETWEEN HERE
AND SANCTUM

09:55.333 --> 09:56.726
DOESN'T SQUARE UP.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.467
THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU CAN BE HERE FOR YEARS,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.861
AND NO ONE WOULD MISS YOU.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.472
I MEAN, NO ONE WOULD
MISS YOU ANYWAY, SO...

10:03.515 --> 10:05.039
THANKS, AND
THE BAD NEWS IS?

10:05.082 --> 10:07.258
THE BAD NEWS IS
THERE'S NO WAY OFF.

10:10.392 --> 10:13.917
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
THERE'S NO BAD NEWS.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.615
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.271
I'VE HAD TIME TO SCOUT.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.013
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THERE ARE NO THREATS.

10:23.057 --> 10:27.888
THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD,
WATER, WE HAVE SHELTER.

10:27.931 --> 10:31.239
WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO
THINK OF SOMEPLACE
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY,

10:31.282 --> 10:33.328
IT'S HERE.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.418
THAT'S WHY THE ANOMALY
CALLED US.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.507
THANK GOD WE DIDN'T CUT
YOUR ARM OFF, BY THE WAY.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.996
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.564
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.392
TO THE ANOMALY.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.394
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

10:56.438 --> 10:59.659
HOPE: TRUST ME
WHEN I TELL YOU
IT IS TOO DEEP.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.749
THE DIVE
WILL KILL YOU.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.708
HOW LONG DID YOU EXPECT
US TO STAY?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.754
WHAT IS IT ABOUT
BELLAMY THAT HAS

11:07.797 --> 11:10.582
OTHERWISE SENSIBLE
WOMEN WILLING
TO DIE FOR HIM?

11:12.628 --> 11:18.112
OCTAVIA TRIED
FOR 6 YEARS TO GET
BACK TO HER BROTHER.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.201
YOU WERE HERE
FOR 6 YEARS?

11:20.244 --> 11:24.509
I WAS HERE
FOR 20 YEARS.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.207
SHE WAS HERE
FOR 10,

11:26.250 --> 11:28.209
6 OF THEM SPENT
TRYING TO REACH
THE PRETTY LIGHT

11:28.252 --> 11:30.907
AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE LAKE.

11:30.951 --> 11:34.389
GABRIEL: HEY. I THINK
I CAN READ THIS.

11:34.432 --> 11:35.912
LET'S HOPE YOU
LEARN FASTER.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.833
ONCE IT DRIES,
I'LL USE THE CHARCOAL

11:43.877 --> 11:47.358
TO BRING OUT THE INDENTATIONS
IN THE PAPER.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.491
NOW TELL ME
ABOUT THE CODE.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.841
TOLD YOU. IT OPERATES
THE BRIDGE.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.452
RIGHT. LIKE THE, UH, ONE
ON OCTAVIA'S BACK.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.498
NO. THAT WAS FOR ME.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.761
FROM WHAT I GATHER,
EVERY MIND HAS

11:58.805 --> 12:01.024
ITS OWN UNIQUE CODE.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.113
THEY CALL IT A--
A BIOMETRIC--

12:03.157 --> 12:07.117
SIGNATURE. HEH.
A CONSCIOUSNESS CODE.
OF COURSE.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.293
WHEN YOU PUT MINE
IN ON SANCTUM,
YOU PULLED ME OVER.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.687
AND SENT OCTAVIA
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.471
NO. I DID THAT.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.386
YOU CAN PULL
SOMEONE THROUGH

12:15.430 --> 12:17.649
BY ENTERING
IN THEIR CODE,
OR YOU CAN TAG THEM

12:17.693 --> 12:19.956
WITH A TRACKER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.566
IT'S GOT TO BE
IN DEEP,

12:21.610 --> 12:23.220
OR THEY COULD END UP
INSIDE OUT

12:23.264 --> 12:25.396
OR SOMETHING.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.312
-THAT'S WHY YOU STABBED HER.
-YEAH.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.140
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.447
DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE
TAKING BELLAMY, TOO?

12:32.490 --> 12:35.580
NO. OF COURSE NOT.
NO. OCTAVIA LOVES HIM.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.887
I MADE A DEAL
TO SAVE MY MOTHER.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.933
THE PLAN WAS FOR ME
TO JUMP BACK IN,

12:39.976 --> 12:42.762
RESCUE HER
AND AUNTY O,

12:42.805 --> 12:44.502
AND KILL ANYONE
WHO GOT IN MY WAY.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.069
OH. SO YOU'RE
A KILLER, ARE YOU?

12:46.113 --> 12:47.854
YOU GOT TRAINING,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,

12:47.897 --> 12:49.551
BUT YOU'RE NO KILLER.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.553
DON'T WORRY.
I'M HERE NOW,

12:51.596 --> 12:53.381
AND IF THEY HAVE BELLAMY,
THEN KILL THEM ALL

12:53.424 --> 12:55.209
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

12:55.252 --> 12:58.081
GABRIEL: WE'D HAVE TO GET
THERE FOR THAT,

12:58.125 --> 13:00.649
AND WE ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE,

13:00.692 --> 13:03.957
NOT WITH THIS ANYWAY.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.263
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE SWIMMING TO
THE ANOMALY AFTER ALL.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.483
HOPE: I TOLD YOU.
IT'S NOT AN ANOMALY.

13:08.526 --> 13:11.399
IT'S A BRIDGE,
A TRANSIT SYSTEM.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.444
THE ONE ON SANCTUM
LEADS HERE,

13:13.488 --> 13:15.446
AND THE ONE UNDER THE LAKE
LEADS TO BARDO.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.797
THE STONES
ARE CONNECTED.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.929
EACH ONE MUST HAVE
A UNIQUE CODE.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.888
GLAD THAT'S
EXCITING FOR YOU,

13:21.931 --> 13:24.325
BUT WE'RE STILL
STUCK HERE.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.330
IT'S WARM.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.077
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.037
BELLAMY?

13:41.081 --> 13:42.778
HOPE: I TOLD YOU.
HE'S NOT HERE.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.436
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

13:51.961 --> 13:53.615
OHH!

13:55.051 --> 13:58.098
HOPE, I'M SORRY.
I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU!

13:58.141 --> 14:00.535
AAH! AAH! AAH!

14:03.190 --> 14:06.367
HOPE: HE CALLED
THE DOLL HOPE.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.544
THE NUMBERS ON HIS ARM
WERE COUNTING DOWN.

14:09.587 --> 14:12.764
IT'S HOW LONG HE'S
A PRISONER HERE.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.375
5 YEARS.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.639
THAT IS HOW LONG
I EXPECT US TO STAY.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.517
GABRIEL: YOU SAID PRISONERS.

14:26.561 --> 14:27.910
YOU DON'T MEAN THIS
IS A PRISON?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.564
I DID MEAN. SKYRING
IS THE PLACE

14:29.607 --> 14:32.654
WHERE THEY SEND PEOPLE
TO ATONE FOR THEIR SINS.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.787
OK. THIS GARDEN
IS ONE OF HIS.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.441
WE HAVE TO START PLANTING
SOON IF WE WANT TO HARVEST

14:37.485 --> 14:38.790
BEFORE WINTER.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.096
COME ON. WE NEED
TO FIND HIM.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.229
SLOW DOWN!

14:42.272 --> 14:44.057
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.493
FROM THE LOOKS
OF OUR NEW FRIEND,

14:45.536 --> 14:47.277
HE'S SURVIVING
ON JELLIES ALONE.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.975
EATING LIKE THAT,
HE WON'T MAKE IT
5 YEARS,

14:49.018 --> 14:50.846
AND WE NEED HIM TO.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.109
-WHY?
-BECAUSE HE'S OUR WAY TO BARDO.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.894
WHEN THE TIMER ON HIS ARM
HITS ZERO,

14:54.937 --> 14:57.026
THE DISCIPLES
COME FOR HIM.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.680
RIGHT, AND YOU THINK
THEY'LL TAKE US, TOO?

14:58.723 --> 15:00.856
OF COURSE NOT.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.512
NO. WE KILL THEM,
TAKE THEIR SUITS,

15:04.555 --> 15:06.340
JUMP TO BARDO.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.907
THERE SHE GOES
TALKING ABOUT
KILLING AGAIN.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.605
WHAT IS THE MATTER?
ARE YOU AFRAID?

15:10.648 --> 15:12.215
YOU KNOW, OCTAVIA
MIGHT NOT HAVE LIKED YOU,

15:12.259 --> 15:13.738
BUT SHE DID SAY
YOU WERE BRAVE.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.088
YOU HAVE TO BE OUT
OF YOUR MIND

15:15.131 --> 15:18.134
IF YOU THINK I'M
WAITING 5 YEARS.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.572
FUNNY. SHE SAID THAT, TOO.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.862
UGH. 120.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.221
OCTAVIA: OHH. I WAS
UNDER FOR 120 SECONDS,

16:01.264 --> 16:02.874
AND IT'S STILL NOT
LONG ENOUGH.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.964
-SHH. HOPE JUST FELL ASLEEP.
-SORRY.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.836
MAYBE IF I USED
HEAVIER ROCKS TO
PULL ME DOWN FASTER.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.620
DO THAT, AND YOU'LL BE
TOO FAR DOWN TO COME BACK UP

16:09.664 --> 16:11.361
WHEN SURVIVAL INSTINCTS
KICK IN.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.928
DURING MY SEALs TRAINING--

16:12.972 --> 16:14.712
NO MORE STORIES
ABOUT SEALs TRAINING.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.410
I'M AT 2 MINUTES.
IF I GET TO 3,

16:16.453 --> 16:18.020
I'LL BE
AT THE GLOW.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.066
HOLDING YOUR BREATH
IS NOT THE HARDEST PART.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.589
OHH. HERE WE GO.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.983
THE 20 METERS, IF YOU
DON'T EQUALIZE RIGHT,

16:24.026 --> 16:25.419
YOUR EARDRUMS BURST.

16:25.462 --> 16:28.204
GO DEEPER, AN UNTRAINED
DIVER LIKE YOU,

16:28.248 --> 16:30.424
BLOOD VESSELS BURST
IN YOUR TRACHEA,

16:30.467 --> 16:31.991
YOUR LUNGS FILL
WITH FLUID.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.557
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT MAKE IT
TO THE OTHER SIDE,

16:33.601 --> 16:34.994
BUT YOU JUST
WON'T KNOW IT.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.432
3 YEARS.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.782
EVERY DAY YOU TRY IT,
AND EVERY DAY YOU FAIL.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.002
IT'D BE BORING IF IT
WASN'T SO DEPRESSING.

16:46.092 --> 16:51.010
THIS IS OUR LIFE NOW.
STOP TORTURING YOURSELF...

16:51.053 --> 16:52.446
AND ME.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.934
YESTERDAY, HOPE CAME UP
WITH A NAME FOR THE PLANET,

17:02.978 --> 17:05.372
BUT GUESS WHO WAS
UNDERWATER WHEN SHE DID.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.422
SO WHAT'S
OUR PLANET CALLED?

17:12.466 --> 17:14.729
SKYRING.

17:14.772 --> 17:18.559
HEH. OF COURSE IT IS.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.881
NOT BAD FOR A PRISON.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.883
GABRIEL: NAH. ISOLATION
IS THE PRISON,

17:38.927 --> 17:40.842
LIKE SOLITARY.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.713
NOW DEPENDING
ON THE TIME DILATION

17:42.757 --> 17:44.280
RELATIVE TO BARDO,
YOU COULD SERVE

17:44.324 --> 17:46.065
A 20-YEAR-SENTENCE HERE
ON A WEEKEND.

17:46.108 --> 17:49.155
HEH. IT'S EFFICIENT.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.679
ECHO: I TAKE IT YOU'VE
DEALT WITH THESE
PRISONERS BEFORE.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.334
-ONE, YES.
-DANGEROUS?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.336
IT DEPENDS.
EVERYONE ON BARDO

17:56.379 --> 17:57.902
IS RAISED TO BE
A DISCIPLE.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.600
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM IS A WARRIOR,

17:59.643 --> 18:04.126
NOT LIKE THE FLOWER CHILDREN
WHO WORSHIPED YOU.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.042
FORTUNATELY, THEY SEND
PEOPLE HERE

18:07.086 --> 18:09.653
WHO AREN'T PULLING
THEIR OWN WEIGHT,

18:09.697 --> 18:11.873
NOT DEVOUT ENOUGH,

18:11.916 --> 18:13.396
NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

18:16.312 --> 18:19.359
IF EVERYTHING I'VE
HEARD ABOUT YOU TWO IS TRUE,

18:19.402 --> 18:22.057
WE CAN TAKE HIM.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.973
ALL RIGHT. BE QUIET.
WE'RE CLOSE.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.068
WHO TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO TRACK?

18:33.112 --> 18:36.158
THE GIRL YOU STABBED
AND KICKED OVER A CLIFF.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.421
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.814
SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD STORY.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.208
YOU JUST HEARD IT.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.558
THE SPY STABBED
HER BOYFRIEND'S SISTER

18:44.601 --> 18:46.734
AND KICKED HER
OVER A CLIFF.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.043
HE WENT THROUGH HERE.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.179
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WITHOUT A MEMORY.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.673
ECHO: WHAT IS THIS?

19:14.544 --> 19:17.765
GABRIEL: I HAVE NO IDEA.
LOOKS LIKE HE DUG UP THE DEAD

19:17.808 --> 19:19.636
SO HE COULD
HAVE COMPANY.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.903
DEV.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.341
MAN: LEAVE US ALONE!

19:28.384 --> 19:31.909
I DIDN'T INVITE
THEM HERE, I SWEAR IT.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.607
I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.348
ISOLATION MADNESS.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.785
MAN: BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE.
I TRIED TO SAVE HOPE.

19:37.828 --> 19:40.004
I TRIED,
BUT I COULDN'T.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.832
I'M SORRY.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

19:41.876 --> 19:44.313
HEY. I'M HOPE.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.494
I GREW UP HERE.

19:51.538 --> 19:55.019
GABRIEL: WAIT.
HOPE: NO, NO, NO.

19:55.063 --> 19:57.413
DAMN IT. I TOLD YOU
WE NEED HIM.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.762
MAYBE WE DON'T.

20:02.549 --> 20:06.857
ECHO: C-O-L.
COLONEL? MILITARY?

20:06.901 --> 20:10.383
COLIN, LAST NAME
BENSON. C.B.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.559
IT WAS ON THE WALL
NEAR THE STONE.

20:27.487 --> 20:31.404
A MIND DRIVE? HOW?

20:31.447 --> 20:32.970
ELIGIUS III WAS HERE.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.761
WE'RE ON PLANET BETA.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.548
SKYRING'S BETTER.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.860
GABRIEL: EVERYONE
ON THE ELIGIUS MISSION GOT ONE.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.297
BECCA FRANKO DESIGNED
THE MIND--

20:55.341 --> 20:56.603
I MEAN, MEMORY DRIVES

20:56.646 --> 20:58.169
TO BE A DATA RETRIEVAL
SYSTEM

20:58.213 --> 21:00.476
SO THE MOTHERSHIP CREW
COULD DETERMINE

21:00.520 --> 21:02.304
WHAT HAPPENED IF THEY
RETURNED TO FIND

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
A MISSION TEAM DEAD,

21:04.001 --> 21:07.483
YOU KNOW, LIKE A--
LIKE A AIRPLANE BLACK BOX.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.225
RUSSELL AND I
REVERSE-ENGINEERED THEIR TECH

21:10.269 --> 21:12.836
TO HOLD AN ENTIRE MIND.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.318
WAIT. THAT'LL PLAY
HIS MEMORIES?

21:16.362 --> 21:17.754
YEAH.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.716
JOSEPHINE?

21:22.759 --> 21:25.284
YEAH.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.286
I NEEDED TO MAKE SURE
SHE WAS REALLY GONE.

21:34.118 --> 21:37.470
JUST--JUST WAIT.
IT'S REPAIRING
CORRUPTED DATA.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.996
SO WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT ELIGIUS III

21:42.039 --> 21:45.042
RANDOMLY CHOSE
TWO PLANETS CONNECTED
BY ANOMALY STONES?

21:45.086 --> 21:47.610
HEH. LONG. I'D SAY
IT SUGGESTS

21:47.654 --> 21:51.484
THAT THE PEOPLE ON BARDO
DESCEND FROM ELIGIUS, AS WELL,

21:51.527 --> 21:53.747
AND IF I'M RIGHT,
IT COULD MEAN
THAT THE SPECIES

21:53.790 --> 21:58.317
THAT CREATED THE STONES
THOUSANDS, PERHAPS
MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO,

21:58.360 --> 22:01.058
WERE LOOKING
FOR A NEW HOME, TOO.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.147
I MEAN, THINK
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

22:03.191 --> 22:06.194
NO NEED FOR SPACESHIPS
OR--OR CRYO

22:06.237 --> 22:08.631
OR MIND DRIVES.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.591
YOU COULD EXPLORE
AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.769
NOT TO POINT OUT
THE OBVIOUS,

22:15.812 --> 22:17.466
BUT IF YOUR FRIEND HERE
FIGURED OUT

22:17.510 --> 22:19.425
HOW TO OPERATE THE STONE,
HE'D HAVE USED IT TO LEAVE.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.992
HE WOULDN'T BE HERE
PLAYING CHESS
WITH THE DEAD.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.646
HEH HEH. NO, NO, NO.
COLIN WAS

22:23.690 --> 22:26.562
A QUANTUM PHYSICIST,
A FIELDS MEDAL WINNER.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.390
IF ANYONE COULD
FIGURE OUT HOW TO--

22:28.434 --> 22:30.914
DR. BENSON, BLINK
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.873
DR. BENSON.

22:32.916 --> 22:36.137
BECCA?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.965
GOD, I HAD A CRUSH
ON HER.

22:38.008 --> 22:40.097
BECCA: THE PROCEDURE
WAS A SUCCESS.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.969
WE'LL REMOVE
THE BREATHING TUBE
IN A MOMENT.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.840
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

22:43.884 --> 22:48.192
GOOD. THE IMPLANT
WILL START COLLECTING
YOUR MEMORY NOW.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.977
IF YOU DIE OUT THERE,
MY FACE WILL BE

22:50.020 --> 22:51.631
THE FIRST THAT
THE FOLLOW TEAM SEES.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.984
I ENVY YOU. YOU ARE GOING
ON THE GREATEST ADVENTURE

22:57.027 --> 23:00.422
IN THE HISTORY
OF HISTORY.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.945
LIGHTBOURNE,
THE POMPOUS ASS, THINKS

23:01.989 --> 23:03.599
THAT ALPHA IS THE ONE.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.427
HE'S AFRAID THAT BETA'S
TOO FAR FROM THE BLACK HOLE

23:05.471 --> 23:07.908
RELATIVE TO THE OTHERS,
BUT IF YOU ASK ME,

23:07.951 --> 23:10.998
TIME DILATION IS
SEXY AS HELL.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.131
YOU'LL GET
TO THE FUTURE FASTER.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.351
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.962
THE BLACK HOLE.
OF COURSE.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.661
THAT'S WHY TIME IS
SO ACCELERATED HERE.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.141
-CAN YOU FAST FORWARD.
-JUST QUIET.

23:24.185 --> 23:25.621
BECCA: YOU'LL BE HERE
IN POST-OP FOR ANOTHER
HOUR OR SO

23:25.665 --> 23:27.623
UNTIL YOU'RE THROUGH
RECOVERY.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.365
THIS IS GONNA
TAKE A WHILE.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.586
THAT GUY OUT THERE
IS GONNA COME HOME.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.805
UNLESS WE WANT TO
WIND UP AS GUESTS
AT HIS PICNIC,

23:35.849 --> 23:37.285
I THINK--

23:37.328 --> 23:39.809
-I'LL TAKE THE FIRST WATCH.
-YEAH.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.463
BECCA: YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO START TO DRINK WATER

23:41.507 --> 23:43.204
IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO.

23:43.247 --> 23:45.554
DON'T BE CONCERNED
IF YOU STILL...

23:45.598 --> 23:48.470
OCTAVIA: NICE WORK.
GO GRAB ME A SHOVEL.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.135
SO REMEMBER,
ONLY 3 SEEDS PER HOLE.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.659
COPY THAT. 3.
CAN I BURY THEM?

24:03.703 --> 24:05.487
MM-HMM.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.968
DIYOZA: NEW PLOT
IS LOOKING GOOD.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.578
I WANT THOSE TOMATOES.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.195
HEY. WHO'S HUNGRY?

24:18.239 --> 24:20.981
LET ME GUESS.
WE'RE VEGAN AGAIN.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.591
ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT
IN THE MOOD

24:22.635 --> 24:24.245
FOR MY JELLYFISH
ETOUFFEE.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.508
-JELLYFISH AND CHIPS.
-YES.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.163
OCTAVIA: I GOT THAT BEAT.
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLYFISH.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.647
JELLYFISH POT PIE
IT IS.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.171
COME ON. EARTH SKILLS
BEFORE DINNER.

24:37.214 --> 24:40.304
AUNTY O'S GONNA TEACH
YOU HOW TO SEW.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.697
I'LL BE RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.960
JUST FINISHING UP
WITH MY ROWS.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.050
MOM, I WANT TO STAY
AND HELP AUNTY O
WITH THE GARDEN.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.487
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
TO HEAR.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.010
TEAMWORK MAKES
THE DREAM WORK.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.490
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:55.276 --> 24:58.888
-OHH!
-OK.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.847
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

25:00.890 --> 25:02.892
SHE'LL HEAR YOU.

25:02.936 --> 25:08.115
I'M TRAINING SO I CAN
HELP YOU SAVE YOUR BROTHER.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.813
MY BROTHER DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW I'M GONE YET.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.642
6 YEARS FOR US
IS, LIKE, A BLINK
OF AN EYE WHERE HE IS.

25:13.686 --> 25:17.254
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TIME
FOR YOU TO MAKE ME LIKE YOU.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.912
OHH! AGH!

25:22.956 --> 25:24.523
OW!

25:29.397 --> 25:32.182
OOH! WHAT IS IT?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.884
I DON'T KNOW.
IT LOOKS--

25:37.927 --> 25:39.886
AAH!

25:39.929 --> 25:41.540
DIYOZA: HOPE!
OCTAVIA: DIYOZA, SHE SHOULDN'T

25:41.583 --> 25:43.237
BE OUT HERE.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.634
GO INSIDE NOW.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.766
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
TIME SOMETHING
WAS PLANTED HERE.

25:54.422 --> 25:55.554
HELP ME GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

25:55.597 --> 25:59.079
HEY. EASY.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.646
THIS IS MY WAY OUT.

26:00.689 --> 26:01.995
OH, GOD. HERE WE GO.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.605
THERE'S A WHOLE
SUIT HERE.

26:03.649 --> 26:07.043
THIS COULD EASILY ADD
A MINUTE TO MY DIVE.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.524
-YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.
-YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.005
IT MIGHT BUY YOU
SOME TIME,

26:12.048 --> 26:14.616
BUT THIS GEAR'S
PROBABLY BIOMETRIC.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.488
THAT MEANS YOU PUT IT ON,
AND IT LETS HIS PEOPLE
KNOW WE'RE HERE,

26:17.532 --> 26:19.229
AND I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

26:19.273 --> 26:23.277
BUT I'D RATHER NOT FACE
A--AN ARMY OF GUYS
LIKE THIS.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.672
COME ON. GIVE ME A HAND
BEFORE HOPE COMES BACK OUT.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.978
STOP. IF THERE'S
TECH IN THIS THING,

26:29.022 --> 26:30.240
IT'S DEADER THAN HE IS.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.242
THIS GETS ME
TO SANCTUM.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.636
I COME BACK
WITH OUR OWN ARMY.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.377
LET THESE GUYS
TRY TO COME.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.599
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

26:42.862 --> 26:44.907
DO YOU?

26:44.951 --> 26:46.256
YOU REALLY WANT TO
EXPOSE HOPE TO THAT--

26:46.300 --> 26:49.651
ARMIES, A WAR?

26:49.695 --> 26:52.698
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO GUILT ME
INTO STAYING.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.222
YES, BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY TACTIC
I HAVEN'T USED.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.790
YOU KNOW I HAVE TO
WARN BELLAMY
ABOUT THE PRIMES.

26:57.833 --> 27:02.664
WHAT ABOUT US?
AREN'T WE YOUR
FAMILY, TOO?

27:02.708 --> 27:05.667
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.974
I'LL COME BACK,
I'LL BRING THE OTHERS.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.890
HOPE CAN HAVE
A REAL LIFE.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.196
IN THE TIME YOU
WAITED TO FOLLOW ME
INTO THE ANOMALY,

27:13.240 --> 27:16.156
I WAS ALREADY HERE
FOR 3 MONTHS.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.898
WHEN YOU COME BACK,
I'LL BE DUST,
AND SO WILL HOPE

27:18.941 --> 27:21.161
AFTER LIVING ALONE
FOR HOWEVER LONG
SHE'S ALIVE

27:21.204 --> 27:22.641
ONCE SHE BURIES ME.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.949
WE HAD A GOOD RUN,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

27:55.282 --> 27:57.893
AUNTY O, WAIT.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.590
DON'T LEAVE.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.121
I MISS YOU ALREADY.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.558
I DON'T WANT TO GROW UP
WITHOUT YOU.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.259
MAYBE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO.

28:16.303 --> 28:20.002
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
THE ANOMALY WORKS, RIGHT?

28:20.046 --> 28:22.309
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
I COULD BE BACK

28:22.352 --> 28:24.137
WITH BELLAMY,
CLARKE, AND MADI.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.834
AND MURPHY?

28:25.878 --> 28:30.099
HIM, TOO.
ALL OF THEM.

28:30.143 --> 28:33.015
I LOVE YOU,
LITTLE ONE.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.930
DON'T YOU EVER
FORGET IT.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.944
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOO MAD AT ME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.730
THIS ISN'T GOOD-BYE.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.341
YOU WON'T ACCEPT THIS NOW,
BUT I'M PROBABLY
SAVING YOUR LIFE

28:54.384 --> 28:55.777
BECAUSE EVEN WITH
THAT THING ON--

28:55.821 --> 28:57.866
AAH!

28:57.910 --> 28:59.520
DIYOZA: YOU WANT TO
HATE ME, HATE ME,

28:59.563 --> 29:01.087
BUT HOPE NEEDS YOU.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.784
STOP MAKING THIS
ABOUT HOPE.

29:05.918 --> 29:09.095
FINE. I NEED YOU, TOO.
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR?

29:09.138 --> 29:11.140
YOUR BROTHER LEFT
YOU TO DIE.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.490
WHY ARE YOU SO EAGER
TO RUN BACK TO HIM?

29:13.534 --> 29:16.842
WHY AREN'T WE ENOUGH?

29:16.885 --> 29:20.715
I JUST NEED TO TELL HIM
I UNDERSTAND.

29:27.940 --> 29:31.813
BECAUSE OF HOPE,
I UNDERSTAND.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.510
I NEED TO TELL HIM.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.473
THIS IS YOUR HOME NOW.

30:00.407 --> 30:04.977
DIYOZA: OK.
HOW'S ABOUT THIS ONE?

30:05.020 --> 30:06.543
READING FIRST,
LITTLE ONE.

30:23.996 --> 30:27.608
OK. GO AHEAD.
SCHOOL CAN WAIT.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.359
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

30:39.402 --> 30:42.188
PLANT.

30:42.231 --> 30:46.279
OCTAVIA, VOICE-OVER: BELL,
I HOPE AGAINST HOPE

30:46.322 --> 30:48.498
THAT THIS LETTER
REACHES YOU.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.761
♪ GONNA BUY YOU
A DIAMOND RING ♪

30:50.805 --> 30:54.200
I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:54.243 --> 30:57.333
THERE WAS A DARKNESS IN ME,

30:57.377 --> 31:01.990
BUT DIYOZA HELPED ME
PAST THAT DARKNESS.

31:02.034 --> 31:05.211
IT'S BEHIND ME NOW.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.735
I NEED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I FINALLY UNDERSTAND

31:07.778 --> 31:10.869
ALL YOU DID TO PROTECT ME,

31:10.912 --> 31:14.089
WATCH OVER ME,

31:14.133 --> 31:15.656
LOVE ME.

31:19.965 --> 31:23.142
I WISH I COULD
SEE YOUR FACE AND HUG YOU...

31:26.058 --> 31:29.061
AND TELL YOU THAT
I GET IT NOW.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.802
I WISH I COULD THANK YOU.

31:31.846 --> 31:35.154
BY THE TIME YOU GET THIS,

31:35.197 --> 31:36.982
IF YOU GET THIS,

31:37.025 --> 31:40.333
I'LL PROBABLY BE
AN OLD LADY OR DEAD.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.771
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I WAS HAPPY.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.729
I HAVE HOPE.

31:45.773 --> 31:50.386
DIYOZA'S A PAIN IN THE ASS,
BUT I LOVE HER

31:50.430 --> 31:52.214
LIKE I LOVE YOU.

31:56.697 --> 31:59.874
PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

31:59.918 --> 32:04.400
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY,
BIG BROTHER.

32:04.444 --> 32:07.926
ALWAYS YOURS, OCTAVIA.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.202
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

33:07.246 --> 33:08.812
I FOUND IT HERE.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.902
THAT WAS NOT MEANT
FOR YOU.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.165
IT'S MY WATCH.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.215
STAY ALERT, HOPE.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.304
HE COULD COME BACK
AT ANY TIME.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.787
COLIN, ON VIEWER:
OK. TRY AGAIN.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.833
THE ELIGIUS TRANSPORT
CRASHED HERE.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.184
HEH. COLIN WAS
THE SOLE SURVIVOR.

33:32.227 --> 33:34.273
HE FOUND THE STONE
THE SAME WAY WE DID,

33:34.316 --> 33:36.840
BY TRACKING
THE RADIO INTERFERENCE.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.538
BUILT THIS CABIN
ABOVE IT.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.279
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

33:40.322 --> 33:43.369
IT'S BRILLIANT. HE USED
A GROUND VIBRATION SENSOR

33:43.412 --> 33:45.545
AND A STETHOSCOPE
SALVAGED FORM THE WRECKAGE

33:45.588 --> 33:47.851
TO MEASURE TINY
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STONE

33:47.895 --> 33:51.420
CAUSED WHEN THE CORRECT
SYMBOL WAS TOUCHED
IN THE RIGHT ORDER.

33:51.464 --> 33:54.075
SO WE HAVE THE CODE?

33:54.119 --> 33:56.817
NO, NO, NOT YET.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.732
THERE'S STILL MILLIONS
OF POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS,

33:58.775 --> 34:01.300
BUT HE'LL GET IT.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.171
I'M SURE OF IT.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.782
COLIN: VERY GREAT
IMPORTANCE, I THINK.

34:21.146 --> 34:24.279
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE THREW
THIS INTO THE BRIDGE.

34:24.323 --> 34:28.849
WE STILL THOUGHT SANCTUM
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

34:28.892 --> 34:32.070
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HOW THEY KNEW WE WERE HERE.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.944
-HEY.
-UNH!

34:40.643 --> 34:43.081
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

34:50.566 --> 34:54.831
WE'LL GET THEM BACK
TOGETHER,

34:54.875 --> 34:57.051
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

34:57.095 --> 35:01.838
WE'LL GET THEM
ALL BACK.

35:01.882 --> 35:04.493
COLIN: OK. BACK
TO THE TRENCHES.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.756
"IT IS THE SAME!
FOR, BE IT JOY OR SORROW,

35:06.800 --> 35:09.237
"THE PATH OF ITS DEPARTURE
STILL IS FREE:

35:09.281 --> 35:11.152
MAN'S YESTERDAY MAY
NE'ER BE"...

35:11.196 --> 35:12.675
SAME DAMN POEM
EVERY DAY.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.155
"NOUGHT MAY ENDURE
BUT MUTABILITY."

35:14.199 --> 35:17.115
HOPE: YOU MUST THINK
I'M SO WEAK.

35:17.158 --> 35:21.075
NO. THE OPPOSITE.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.295
I'VE SEEN YOUR MOVES,

35:23.338 --> 35:26.646
AND WITH TEACHERS
LIKE DIYOZA
AND OCTAVIA,

35:26.689 --> 35:28.387
I WOULDN'T WANT TO
FACE YOU IN BATTLE.

35:28.430 --> 35:31.390
THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME
TO FIGHT.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.436
NO. MY MOM WOULDN'T
ALLOW IT.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.525
NO. A PRISONER CAME HERE

35:36.569 --> 35:41.095
A FEW MONTHS
AFTER THEY LEFT--DEV.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.620
HE TAUGHT ME.

35:44.664 --> 35:48.189
-THE BODY.
-YEAH.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.670
COLIN: OK. LET'S TRY AGAIN.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.847
WAIT. THERE.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.110
THE OPERATIONS
ARE IN SYNC.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.373
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.983
HERE WE GO.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.207
WHAT IS THAT?

36:08.557 --> 36:10.864
THE PORTAL RISES
FROM THE LAKE.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.387
OF COURSE.

36:14.824 --> 36:19.220
PEN. I NEED A PEN. UM...

36:19.264 --> 36:21.222
A PEN! HE DID IT!

36:21.266 --> 36:22.745
I NEED A PEN.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.791
HA! OHH! HE DID IT!

36:24.834 --> 36:26.227
I NEED SOMETHING
TO WRITE WITH,

36:26.271 --> 36:28.273
UH, THE CHARCOAL,
A PEN, ANYTHING!

36:33.626 --> 36:35.105
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.067
HEY, HEY.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.112
WHAT IS THIS?

36:42.156 --> 36:45.028
IT'S OK. NO ONE'S
GONNA HURT YOU.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.814
THAT'S A MEMORY
VIEWER, OK?

36:47.857 --> 36:49.903
MY FRIEND WAS HERE.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.818
NOW THAT MAN JUST
ENTERED THE CODE

36:51.861 --> 36:53.254
AND OPENED THE BRIDGE.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.910
WE NEED TO REWIND IT
SO THAT ONCE WE SEE IT

36:56.953 --> 37:00.522
WE CAN OPEN THE BRIDGE
OURSELVES, OK?

37:00.566 --> 37:03.177
YOU CAN GO HOME.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.529
TOO SOON. I MUST
SERVE MY TIME.

37:07.573 --> 37:12.534
ECHO: OK. IF YOU
WANT TO STAY,
YOU CAN STAY.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.275
JUST GIVE US BACK--

37:14.319 --> 37:15.929
NO!

37:15.972 --> 37:17.670
I SERVE
THE MASTER.

37:17.713 --> 37:21.543
I AM HIS SHIELD
AND HIS SWORD

37:21.587 --> 37:23.632
FOR ALL MANKIND!

37:23.676 --> 37:24.851
-NO, NO, NO, NO!
-AGH!

37:24.894 --> 37:26.287
ECHO: NO!

38:01.931 --> 38:03.933
YOU ACED YOUR READING,
BUT YOUR MATH--

38:03.977 --> 38:05.718
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
AGAIN AFTER DINNER.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.766
REMEMBER THIS?

38:10.810 --> 38:12.899
HA HA!

38:12.942 --> 38:14.379
I REMEMBER CARRYING
YOUR ASS

38:14.422 --> 38:16.076
THROUGH THE WOODS
IN IT.

38:18.470 --> 38:22.517
THAT'S ME ON DISHES.

38:22.561 --> 38:23.997
I COULD HAVE MADE
YOUR DAUGHTER
A PAIR OF PANTS

38:24.040 --> 38:25.955
IF YOU DIDN'T RIP
THE SLEEVE OFF.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.958
I RIPPED THE SLEEVE
OFF TO SAVE THAT
GNARLY ARM OF YOURS.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.526
IT'S TIME TO THROW
THAT DAMN THING AWAY.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.485
THAT'S DISHES
TOMORROW, TOO.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.271
YEP.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.764
KEEP HER OUT
OF SIGHT.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.287
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.854
PLEASE JUST DO
WHAT I SAY.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.246
HOPE: MOM?
OCTAVIA: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.552
HEY, HEY. YOU'RE GONNA
BE OK.

39:15.265 --> 39:16.832
OHH!

39:24.449 --> 39:27.800
WHO ARE YOU--
OCTAVIA OR DIYOZA?

39:27.843 --> 39:30.411
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH.
GREAT.

39:30.455 --> 39:32.718
YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.247
OCTAVIA LEFT
A LONG TIME AGO,

39:40.290 --> 39:42.031
RIGHT AFTER SHE
DROPPED THIS NOTE.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.469
I'M ALONE
HERE NOW.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.471
SEARCH THE CABIN
FOR THE OTHER ONE.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.429
RESTRAIN HER.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.737
OCTAVIA, YOU FOOL!
THERE IS NO HOPE!

39:51.780 --> 39:53.478
COME OUT NOW!

39:53.521 --> 39:55.001
GO NOW.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.832
GET IN. HURRY!

40:04.314 --> 40:05.751
I NEED YOU TO
STAY QUIET.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.492
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR,

40:07.535 --> 40:09.755
YOU HAVE TO STAY QUIET,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

40:09.798 --> 40:12.627
I PROMISE YOU MOMMY
AND AUNTY O WILL COME
BACK FOR YOU,

40:12.671 --> 40:16.152
BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU SHH.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.154
MAN: COME OUT!

40:18.198 --> 40:19.895
YOU BE BRAVE.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.421
COME OUT AND SURRENDER.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.382
ALL RIGHT! FRONT!

40:31.994 --> 40:33.866
ON YOUR KNEES
RIGHT NOW!

40:41.830 --> 40:43.353
MAN: COME ON.
OCTAVIA: AAH!

40:43.397 --> 40:46.095
-STOP RESISTING!
-LET ME GO!

40:46.139 --> 40:47.923
-WE DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.
-LET ME GO!

40:55.061 --> 40:56.628
SECURE THEM.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.981
HELMETS ON.

41:02.024 --> 41:04.200
ANDERS WANTS THEM TO
REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.464
ON YOUR FEET. MOVE.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.134
MOM! OCTAVIA!

41:28.703 --> 41:30.009
MOM!

41:35.797 --> 41:37.103
MOM?
