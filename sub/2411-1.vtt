00:29.120 --> 00:30.999
<i>Yes. Uh-huh.</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:32.519
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

00:32.520 --> 00:35.879
That's where this
"class act" brought me.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.959
Yeah, you heard me. Hooters.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.999
This is the first date I've
been on since the divorce...

00:42.000 --> 00:45.124
and the guy brings me to a Hooters.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.599
Is Tyler asleep?

00:48.600 --> 00:50.919
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

00:50.920 --> 00:53.479
- Not all the way.
- What's he doing?

00:53.480 --> 00:56.286
<i>This T-shirt's on fire!</i>

00:56.800 --> 00:58.279
Why is he singing that?

00:58.280 --> 01:00.801
Must save planet Earth.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.999
No, It's all good.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.759
<i>- It's out.</i>
- What's out?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.239
Oh, God, I'm coming home.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.805
Intruder alert.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.439
Yeah, maybe that's not
actually a bad idea.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.559
Okay, here's the plan: You're
gonna call me in 10 minutes...

01:19.560 --> 01:22.639
so that I can tell this
dope I have an emergency.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.286
Can you give me my bath now?

01:25.920 --> 01:27.804
Make it five minutes.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.159
Got you, uh, Buffalo shrimp
with the sauce on the side.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.728
They'll do that for me here.
I didn't know how you took it so...

02:07.960 --> 02:12.039
You realize that you're not actually
looking at my face right now.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.799
Very tight game going on there.
I don't wanna miss it.

02:14.800 --> 02:19.085
<i>You gotta really swing the ax hard
to get those, uh, hits in deep.</i>

02:19.680 --> 02:21.399
- Hi, Jim.
- Hey, Jim.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.719
Hey, Jim.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.399
Cheese sticks in the
shape of a heart.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.570
From me, Bunny,
Bethany and Britney.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.406
Thank you, Bubbles.
That's very nice.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.479
- Have fun.
- See you.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.125
All right.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.319
Hey, I noticed that you made
eye contact with Boobies...

02:38.320 --> 02:41.285
but I'm not sure it was her
eyes you were looking at.

02:45.680 --> 02:51.439
So you organize
closets for a living.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.759
Yes.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.719
Is it hard to find people who can't organize
their own closets? How does that work?

02:57.720 --> 03:00.279
Well, it's not that they
can't do it for themselves.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.759
It's that they don't have the time
or they don't do it efficiently.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.319
Did you start with organizing
glove compartments...

03:06.320 --> 03:08.648
and just work your way
up from there or...?

03:11.760 --> 03:16.159
Listen, I'm sorry. I know this
is not going well. I, heh...

03:16.160 --> 03:18.761
I haven't been on a
date in 20 years.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.119
I haven't been on a
date since senior year.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.129
You get married in college?

03:26.520 --> 03:29.087
- Yep.
- Me too.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.799
- Really?
- Yes.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.559
Is this not the weirdest feeling
in the world right now?

03:33.560 --> 03:37.039
Like Weird Al starring
in <i>Weird Science.</i>

03:37.040 --> 03:40.847
Yes. I like that. You
just came up with that?

03:41.440 --> 03:42.839
Yes.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.530
Very good.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.359
You know, I think I will have
one of these Buffalo shrimp.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.210
And I'll have it with the sauce.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.647
Excellent.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.201
Oh, my God.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.885
Oh.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.439
- It's hot.
- Oh, my God. Who makes sauce this hot?

04:04.440 --> 04:05.799
I just...

04:05.800 --> 04:07.639
Did you drink my beer?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.159
No. No, no. I think you did.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.319
Boobies! Buddy! Britney!

04:11.320 --> 04:14.919
- Can you get me some water?
- Here. Have some French onion soup.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.119
You know, I'm curious.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.199
With so many possible reasons...

04:26.200 --> 04:29.609
which one's the one
your wife left you for?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.490
Cancer.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.404
I'm sorry. I...

04:41.560 --> 04:45.242
naturally just assumed
you were divorced.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.199
It's okay.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.919
I naturally assumed your
husband shot himself.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.929
So we're even.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.164
I gotta take this.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.639
Hello.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down!

05:02.720 --> 05:05.479
An avalanche in our backyard?

05:05.480 --> 05:07.444
I'll be home right away.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.568
It's an emergency. I'm sorry.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.527
Twenty dollars should
cover my half.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.919
<i>He used the emergency
excuse on you?</i>

05:17.920 --> 05:20.559
Like he's the one
that had to escape.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.199
- Like I'm so horrible.
- Huh.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.959
Well, everybody has a bad blind-date
story and this loser is yours.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.439
Who set you up?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.839
One of the mothers
in Tyler's class.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.599
Every time I see her she tells
me about her "friend Jim."

05:34.600 --> 05:37.519
And, "Oh, I just have to meet Jim."

05:37.520 --> 05:39.599
Well, she's a liar and an idiot.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.799
You should roofie her
and shave her head.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.242
Dick? Hi.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.919
- No, I can talk. I'm just at work.
- Great.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.202
Ha, ha. I know. I'm so sore.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.484
I L word you too.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.767
Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.439
Did you just use the
L word with Dick?

06:08.440 --> 06:10.199
We said it last night.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.799
Jen! That's great! Why
didn't you tell me?

06:13.800 --> 06:17.639
Well, you know. You finally went
on a date and it was so awful.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.079
I didn't want to make you feel lonelier
than you probably already feel.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.559
I'm fine, actually.
And I'm not lonely.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.159
I have two wonderful
men in my life:

06:26.160 --> 06:27.964
Brendan and Tyler.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.039
Brendan needs a girlfriend
and Tyler needs Ritalin.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.799
You're suggesting sex and drugs as a
remedy for my children's behavior.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.799
Aah. Oh, my God. This is the
dress I've been wanting forever.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.079
Ooh.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.519
What? No.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.239
- Who has that kind of money?
- Dick.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.799
Try this on. This is
a total MILF dress.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.209
We don't try on the clients' clothes.
It's one of our selling points.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.999
"We won't wear your underwear while
we're organizing your closets."

06:56.000 --> 06:57.281
I'm just saying.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.999
Back to work.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.559
I think right at the bottom of this rack,
we could fit some more shoes and storage...

07:03.560 --> 07:04.839
Jen!

07:04.840 --> 07:08.119
Kanye, come and change the baby.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.639
North is wet and I don't wanna
drop her on camera again.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.799
Okay. Take it off.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.279
No! Look, this whole rack
still has the price tags on.

07:19.280 --> 07:23.359
Technically, she hasn't taken ownership yet.
And besides, she's at the tennis club.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.199
Now, try this on.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.639
This dress can change a woman
from the kind a man cheats on...

07:28.640 --> 07:30.599
to the kind a man cheats with.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.011
I'm gonna go pee.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.559
Expensive. Expensive.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.649
Ooh, most expensive.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.246
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna look that good in it.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.399
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.759
I should have tried harder.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.919
I should have dressed sexier.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.203
You didn't do anything
wrong. Mark is a pig.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.559
But the kids don't know that.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.206
Agh. They just...

08:15.640 --> 08:17.839
They want us to get back together.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.159
And I don't know how
to explain it to them.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.119
Well, it's time for them to learn
that their dad is a big pile of crap.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.519
I get so depressed I need
to wear high, sexy heels.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.041
- Stop jogging.
- It helps.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.078
It's freaking me out.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.599
Look at me. I'm ridiculous.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.246
Come here. Come here.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.328
- Jen's got you.
- Now I see why they call you "Closet Queens."

08:45.760 --> 08:47.799
- Instagram.
- Facebook.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.161
- Yes!
- Yes!

08:50.480 --> 08:54.239
It was awful, man. There
was no connection at all.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.039
I was so happy when you came
up with the avalanche thing.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.799
- That saved my life.
- Ha-ha-ha.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.159
And the way she dressed was like an
assistant principal or something.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.850
I felt like I was in detention.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.599
- I got a girl for you.
- Yeah?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.848
Blond lady. From my
belly-dancing class.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.845
A little bit on the plus size.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.119
But when she gets to moving, all
that flapping can make it happen.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.599
- No good.
- That big girl would hit that Hooters...

09:16.600 --> 09:20.725
like a hurricane. Agh! Chicken.
Steak. Fries. And a Diet Coke.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.851
- All right! Gotcha!
- Ha-ha-ha.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.359
I'm out, man. No
more dating for me.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.799
It's time and money I should
be spending with my kids.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.809
Look who it is.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.759
Hey, Larry!

09:31.760 --> 09:33.559
My all-star! Give me some.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.445
It's Hilary, Dad,
which is bad enough.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.171
You gonna leave me hanging?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.639
Boom. Guess what?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.639
The new Kodiak tents just arrived.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.330
In time for spring break.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.279
We're going camping in our
back yard again this year?

09:47.280 --> 09:48.891
Why? You too old for that?

09:48.920 --> 09:52.039
No. It's just some kids in my
class are going to Florida...

09:52.040 --> 09:55.323
or to Colorado or even Switzerland.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.119
You got a lot of rich
kids in your school.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.927
- We don't got that kind of money.
- I know. It'd just be nice to go someplace.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.159
You know where you could
take her that's cheap?

10:06.160 --> 10:08.362
My belly-dancing class.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.882
Oh. Put that away. Seriously.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.522
Excuse me, sir? I'm here to
pick up my basketball uniform.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.330
Did you just call me "sir"?

10:19.480 --> 10:22.684
- Yeah.
- I'm a girl.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.879
That's one fugly girl.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.559
Hey, man, that's his daughter.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.770
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Mm.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.239
Hey, honey, how's the
math homework coming?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.363
Are any of the tutor's
shortcuts helping?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.606
Did you go on a date?

10:40.680 --> 10:43.479
A date? Who told you
I went on a date?

10:43.480 --> 10:46.889
You should really change your e-mail
password, little Miss 072099.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.559
That is the last time I use
your birthday as a password.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.159
I can't believe you
read my e-mails.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.999
Brendan, I love you...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.682
but we have to learn to respect
each other's privacy in this house.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.559
Who's Jim?

11:00.560 --> 11:03.799
Nobody, honey. A buffoon.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.439
Trust me. It was nothing.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.799
- You promise?
- Promise.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.559
Hey! No wheels in the house!

11:12.560 --> 11:14.199
- I've told you this!
- Aah!

11:14.200 --> 11:15.759
Tackle him, Mom! Get him!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.279
Did your dad take you for
ice cream on the way home?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.439
- Spank him!
- Rocky Road and mint chocolate chip!

11:20.440 --> 11:23.439
- Take him to the ground!
- I'm on top of the world! Goose, goose!

11:24.920 --> 11:26.999
- Yeah.
- You're dead!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.399
No more titty twisters, guys!

11:29.400 --> 11:32.159
You only have two titties
for the rest of your lives!

11:32.160 --> 11:35.170
We need to learn to
love and respect them.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.767
I always did.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.119
How many times have I told you...

11:39.120 --> 11:42.439
not to pump him full of sugar
before you drop him off?

11:42.440 --> 11:45.159
Oh, come on. Going out with
Dad for an ice cream cone...

11:45.160 --> 11:46.879
is a lasting memory for a kid.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.439
Oh, okay. Well, if Dad spent
more time with him...

11:50.440 --> 11:53.279
then the memories wouldn't
have to be so "lasting."

11:53.280 --> 11:55.239
Boom, zing. Got me again.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.171
It's so great spending
time with you, Lauren.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.966
That doesn't go there.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.679
What are we gonna do?

12:03.680 --> 12:07.319
Oh. Oh, man! It's gonna
explode in 3, 2...

12:07.320 --> 12:08.521
Oh, thank God.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.081
That was close. It was almost
unorganized for a minute.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.999
- Hi.
- How are you?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.439
Good. Are you going to
Tyler's game on Saturday?

12:17.440 --> 12:20.371
- Yes! Of course!
- Great. I'm putting you down.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.479
It's what you do best.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.559
On the board, Mark. On the board.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.003
Lauren, the boys don't need a
board. They don't need a list.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.799
The know they can
count on me. That's it.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.919
Dad, can you help me
with my homework?

12:33.920 --> 12:37.879
Oh, I can't, bud! Sorry! I gotta
go to a thing! Ask your mom!

12:37.880 --> 12:40.048
This is not an example
of my behavior.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.006
Did you leave?

12:46.280 --> 12:52.439
<i>No, oh, oh
I'll never be that girl again</i>

12:52.440 --> 12:54.239
<i>No, oh, oh</i>

12:54.240 --> 12:57.359
<i>My innocence is wearin' thin</i>

12:57.360 --> 13:00.439
<i>But my heart is growin' strong</i>

13:00.440 --> 13:05.799
<i>So call me, call me, call me</i>

13:05.800 --> 13:11.000
<i>Miss movin' on
Oh, oh, oh</i>

13:17.360 --> 13:19.608
- Larry, wanna shoot some hoops?
- Dad!

13:20.520 --> 13:21.719
- Oh!
- Aah!

13:21.720 --> 13:23.319
- Stop! Get Out!
- Oh!

13:23.320 --> 13:24.999
Why wouldn't you knock?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.119
I'm sorry, honey!
I didn't see anything!

13:27.120 --> 13:28.999
Oh, thanks a lot!

13:29.000 --> 13:30.479
No, no, no!

13:30.480 --> 13:32.839
There was plenty of stuff to see!

13:32.840 --> 13:34.079
Uh...

13:34.080 --> 13:37.204
I mean, I didn't see
any gelling going on!

13:37.920 --> 13:40.282
- How about a fist bump?
- No!

13:41.320 --> 13:44.410
Larry, we both need this fist bump.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.490
We're cool.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.328
Hey, how we doing in here?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.806
I'm talking to Mom.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.640
Great. What are you
guys talking about?

14:09.320 --> 14:11.124
It's girl stuff.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.928
Okay. Well, just so you know, I'm
pretty good with girl stuff too.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.445
Excuse me for a second.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.319
Thanks, Dad.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.284
But I just wanna talk to Mom.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.361
Sure, sure.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.931
Say hi for me.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.439
I'm all out of stickers.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.879
You're all out of face.
What happened to you? Ugh.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.764
Can I play with Espn now?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.122
Espn is having her quiet time.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.445
Oh. With Invincible Mommy?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.211
"Invisible." Yes.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.999
It's not fair only
Espn gets to see her.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.439
I know.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.279
I wish I could see her.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.766
Me too.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.959
Come here. Mm.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.762
Eh, eh?

15:03.320 --> 15:04.479
Mac and cheese?

15:04.480 --> 15:06.119
- Mac and cheese.
- Yeah!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.639
I mean, he's looking around
here. Looking for you.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.679
You knew it was today.
I published the calendar.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.319
<i>Laur, the meeting went longer than
expected. What do you want from me?</i>

15:23.320 --> 15:27.399
You know what? I just want you
to be a dad! I can't take it!

15:27.400 --> 15:30.999
Why don't you hop over to the snack
bar, see if they sell any chill pills.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.489
"Chill pills"? Why don't you
"bust a move" back to 1990.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.889
You're at a baseball game?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.519
I'm going on a mystery
trip with Dick.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.679
That's so great.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.479
I have no idea where we're going.
He's so much fun.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.091
I'm so excited!

15:47.520 --> 15:52.044
Now batting, number
23, Tyler Reynolds.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.559
Okay! Come on! Go Tyler! Whoo!

15:55.560 --> 15:58.159
- Come on, Tyler!
- They're putting this kid in?

15:58.160 --> 16:01.119
League rule. Every kid
has to play two innings.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.526
Even kids like him.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.959
- You shut your piehole.
- I'll kick your ass!

16:04.960 --> 16:08.721
- Or I'll stuff my entire fist in your mouth!
- Burt Reynolds scrawny reject!

16:09.000 --> 16:12.090
Hey, how old is that pitcher?
He looks like a NASCAR driver.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.359
- Strike!
- Come on!

16:20.360 --> 16:23.239
It's okay, buddy!
Shake it off! It's okay!

16:23.240 --> 16:26.159
Oh, no. He's not gonna have
one of his meltdowns, is he?

16:26.160 --> 16:29.119
No. He has two more swings.
It's gonna be okay.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.399
Okay. I better go now, then.
Oh, by the way, I need a week off.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.399
Oh, yeah, sure.
When's the vacation?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.965
Two weeks from today.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.919
Wait. No. That's not gonna work.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.249
Because that's spring break and
I've gotta take care of the boys.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.199
- Strike two!
- Why?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.239
It's okay, cutie, you got this!

16:46.240 --> 16:48.363
Check out what happens
when this kid strikes out.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.919
- You have been warned, Ratso!
- One more comment and it is go time!

16:51.920 --> 16:54.122
- I will crush you!
- So checkity check it!

16:55.400 --> 16:58.119
I thought Mark was taking the
kids whitewater rafting.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.879
Oh, shocker. He canceled.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.439
Business trip.

17:01.440 --> 17:05.118
Now I'm racking my brain trying to
figure out how to compete with that.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.839
You won't. There's no time.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.959
And why should we
both stay at home?

17:08.960 --> 17:12.289
You are the bestest
business partner ever. Heh.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.519
- Strike three!
- I hate this!

17:15.520 --> 17:17.598
I hate this! I hate this! I suck!

17:17.599 --> 17:18.925
No.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.080
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.446
Oh, God.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.484
Maybe you should try badminton.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.319
- Maybe you should try mouthwash!
- And deodorant!

17:33.320 --> 17:36.439
- And some testosterone supplement!
- And some Cialis!

17:36.440 --> 17:38.290
I'm just assuming!

17:38.840 --> 17:41.042
And shave your neck!

17:41.680 --> 17:43.405
It's very hairy.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.079
God.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.206
What?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.245
Ugh.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.161
No.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.491
Damn it.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.083
<i>Rip that little loop off the back
of your shirt. And Step Three...</i>

19:11.840 --> 19:13.799
- Daddy?
- Yes.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.651
What do you miss about Mommy?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.444
What do I miss about Mommy?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.805
Hmm.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.247
Everything.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.251
I miss her laugh.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.245
And her smile.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.239
And I miss her little nose
that she gave to you.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.919
Luckily you didn't get mine.
You'd look very weird.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.039
- Heh.
- Yeah.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.961
I miss every time <i>The
Wizard of Oz</i> was on.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.599
- I love that movie.
- I know.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.599
She would sing all the songs to us.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.565
Especially "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow."

19:52.040 --> 19:54.607
You know what I miss
most about her?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.565
What?

19:57.040 --> 19:59.846
Getting to tell her
how much I love her.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.370
Are you allowed to do
that with anyone else?

20:05.800 --> 20:08.048
Am I allowed?

20:08.440 --> 20:11.883
Your mother, before she left...

20:12.880 --> 20:17.802
that's all she would talk about,
was me finding somebody else.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.165
But I would tell her I can't
because she's my one and only.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.644
What did Mommy say?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.199
Your mom would say...

20:29.200 --> 20:34.167
my heart is so big that
it has room for two.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.409
That's another thing I
miss about your mother.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.804
She actually thought I was awesome.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.002
I think you're awesome, Daddy.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.519
Thank you.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.279
Hey, Dad? Um...

20:51.280 --> 20:54.999
I have a personal errand to run,
and I need to borrow the car.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.999
Well, you can't drive
without me yet...

20:57.000 --> 20:59.719
and somebody's got to stay
here with your sisters.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.119
Dad, I have a personal errand.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.679
What does that even mean?
You taking a hit out on somebody?

21:06.680 --> 21:09.531
Dad, she's monsterating.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.999
- What?
- I have my period!

21:13.000 --> 21:16.204
Oh. I forgot you get those.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.369
"Tampax Pearls."

21:20.000 --> 21:21.879
Douches. "Fresh Scent."

21:21.880 --> 21:25.119
"Medicated" and "Sweet Romance."

21:25.120 --> 21:29.689
Yeah, let's not be doing the
Sweet Romance douches quite yet.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.562
"Poise Feminine Wash."

21:32.840 --> 21:35.407
"Poise"? That's a
little close, guys.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.565
"Always Clean"?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.846
I could actually use those. Uh...

21:41.840 --> 21:44.930
What's a Diva Cup?
Is that to make coffee?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.970
I don't under...

21:48.680 --> 21:50.609
What kind do you guys use?

21:53.160 --> 21:54.930
Huh.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.360
- No!
- Hi.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.645
Don't tell me.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.124
- Lauren.
- Lauren.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.039
Mr. Hooters.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.519
Jim.

22:19.520 --> 22:22.963
What's going on in the sweater?
Just for the articles?

22:23.040 --> 22:27.802
No. These, um, actually
are for my son.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.971
Wow. What a progressive mother.

22:31.040 --> 22:36.644
No. I found a centerfold under
his bed, and I tore it up.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.519
From a magazine, not the Internet?

22:39.520 --> 22:41.719
He's old school. I respect that.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.285
Why'd you tear it up?

22:43.320 --> 22:46.000
Because as a woman I
was totally offended.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.245
You don't have to be. It's a
normal part of growing up.

22:51.080 --> 22:55.399
Okay, but he taped a picture of
our babysitter's face on it.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.559
Okay, that's sick. He needs help.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.359
Borderline Dahmer situation.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.439
Oh, very funny. Okay, but if you
had kids you'd understand...

23:03.440 --> 23:05.802
- Three daughters.
- ...it's complicated.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.599
You have three daughters?

23:07.600 --> 23:11.771
Yes. Do you have any other
children, or just the masturbator?

23:12.320 --> 23:14.239
He has a younger brother.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.602
Uh-huh. Maybe you'll do a
better job with that kid.

23:17.200 --> 23:21.200
I'm just joking. So what, you're here
to replace it before the kid finds out?

23:21.560 --> 23:25.879
Yes. But I can't tell what
magazine it's from. I just...

23:25.880 --> 23:28.367
Do you have any of the
centerfold remnants?

23:29.160 --> 23:30.771
Yes, I do.

23:34.560 --> 23:38.399
I, um... I tried to
tape it back up.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.602
Did a great job.
You can hardly tell.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.919
Snapper magazine.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.119
How can you tell?

23:47.120 --> 23:50.319
From the staple placement and
the way the paper feels...

23:50.320 --> 23:53.729
and I already have this copy at home.
How about a fist bump? Huh?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.690
Ah.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.130
- Yep, that's the one.
- Great.

23:59.440 --> 24:03.679
Excuse me. Actually, I thought of
something that might help us both...

24:03.680 --> 24:06.199
to save us some embarrassment.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.007
How about I bring that up to the
cashier, and you bring this up for me.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.159
- Whoa. Are these for your daughter?
- Yeah. She's 15.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.931
And her "friend" just paid a visit.

24:17.480 --> 24:21.399
Okay. Well, these are for
a much older "friend."

24:21.400 --> 24:25.639
A much heavier "friend" staying
in a much bigger "room"...

24:25.640 --> 24:27.729
than your daughter has.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.999
You lost me.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.519
You found me. Oh.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.799
- Can I get a bump?
- No.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.570
No.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.639
Okay. So you will do this.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.039
That'll be $13.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.765
Hi, I'm Tom.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.240
- Here's your change.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.688
Yeah, you told me. Next.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.639
Oh.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.199
I remember the Slender Fit days.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.084
You must be doing your Kegels.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.803
Nowadays, I need six of
these taped together.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.885
Okay. Moving on.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.929
And we got...

25:05.480 --> 25:08.081
that and card.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.199
Rockin' Saturday night, huh, Lefty?

25:11.200 --> 25:14.165
Oh, that's not mine.
That's for her kid.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.729
Ooh, pretty progressive mom.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.519
- Yeah. That's what I said to her too.
- Why would you do that?

25:20.520 --> 25:23.799
- I'm sorry. I'll get you out of it.
- What is wrong with you?

25:23.800 --> 25:27.482
She just takes her homeschooling
real serious, so that's why...

25:28.600 --> 25:30.086
We get those back?

25:30.200 --> 25:34.166
She's gotta get home to the
kid and get him going.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.407
- Take care.
- Yeah.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.570
Hi, I'm Tom.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.119
Ugh, thanks a lot for
selling me out back there.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.999
Oh, she didn't even hear about...

25:45.000 --> 25:47.639
- I panicked. I'm sorry. Here.
- Oh, I noticed.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.799
Thank you.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.129
I can't believe you
have three girls.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.320
- What does that even mean?
- I just can't imagine you with three girls.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.521
Don't, then.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.327
I'm sorry. What are their names?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.571
Hilary, Lou and Espn.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.479
- "Espin." That's unique.
- Mm-hm.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.841
Is it Biblical?

26:09.400 --> 26:12.763
No. Named after my
favorite network.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.479
ESPN.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.239
- No.
- Yep.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.999
- What?
- Heh.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.239
Pretty cool.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.039
Oh, my God.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.891
Your wife must have been a saint.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.999
She was.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.568
Your husband must have been
very patient dealing with...

26:37.280 --> 26:38.839
Ah.

26:38.840 --> 26:43.119
Another charming sentiment
from Captain Cheese Sticks.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.439
You know what? Hooters is too good
for you. I'd never bring you there again.

26:46.440 --> 26:50.479
Well, then I guess I'll just have to learn
to get through life without Hooters.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.251
You've been doing a pretty
damn good job so far!

26:54.680 --> 26:58.601
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I didn't realize they were that big.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.883
Oh, whatever.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.039
Guys, unfortunately your dad had
a business trip that came up...

27:20.040 --> 27:24.119
so your whitewater rafting trip is
gonna get postponed till this summer.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.799
- What?
- We're stuck here doing nothing all week?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.719
I have plans. I have
great plans actually.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.810
Like what? Bowling and
going to the mall?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.199
How did you know?

27:35.520 --> 27:38.291
- Bet that's Dad!
- Maybe he'll take us on his business trip!

27:40.400 --> 27:44.439
- Oh, hey. Is your mom home?
- What do you mean "Is your mom home"?

27:44.440 --> 27:46.961
- Who are you?
- I'm Jim.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.086
Jim? Jim66@DSG.com?

27:51.240 --> 27:54.159
What is this, <i>Dateline NBC?</i>
Yes, you got it right.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.599
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to your mother.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.439
- Not a big deal.
- She said she's not interested in you.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.599
Believe me, Frodo, I don't like her either.
I have to sort something out with her.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.963
- Brendan, honey, who's at the...?
- Hey.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.839
- Jim.
- You lied! Liar! You like him!

28:10.840 --> 28:13.599
What? I didn't lie, honey.
He's a buffoon.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.519
- Just like I said.
- Don't talk to me!

28:15.520 --> 28:16.759
Ever!

28:16.760 --> 28:19.645
No, sweetie, come on.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.199
- What?
- Great.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.239
Which one was the masturbator?
The big one?

28:25.240 --> 28:27.799
Why are you here? What do you want?

28:27.800 --> 28:30.439
The old bag at the pharmacy
mixed up our cards.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.239
That's impossible because I
keep my cards very organized.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.959
I keep them in
color-coded sleeves...

28:34.960 --> 28:38.559
All right, I'll give this back to
whoever it belongs to. Lauren Reynolds.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.684
- You know her? Have you met her?
- Oh.

28:41.760 --> 28:46.170
God, I don't know what's wrong with me
lately. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.839
Just come in.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.439
So wait. How do you
know where I live?

28:50.440 --> 28:54.079
I Googled you and "Closet
Queens" came up.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.204
- You're a lesbian?
- No.

28:58.640 --> 29:03.319
We organize "closets" and we're
the best, so we're "queens."

29:03.320 --> 29:04.681
"Closet Queens."

29:04.960 --> 29:07.447
Maybe the picture was confusing me.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.041
What picture?

29:12.240 --> 29:14.519
Ugh, those little weasels.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.199
Your girlfriend, like, does
she know we went on a date?

29:17.200 --> 29:19.359
Is she gonna kill me?
She looks nuts.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.039
- Lauren!
- Well, here she is.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.839
- I have to talk to you!
- I never touched her. She repulses me.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.519
- What?
- What?

29:27.520 --> 29:28.839
Jen, what's wrong?

29:28.840 --> 29:31.839
- It's over between me and Dick.
- Over?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.849
I thought you don't like dick.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.959
But you guys just started
using the L word.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.279
The <i>L Word.</i> I saw that show.
You guys love that one I'm guessing.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.919
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Are you here to fix something?

29:42.920 --> 29:46.283
- You should probably go and do that.
- I'm Jim. I'm not a threat.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.879
- Jim?
- The blind-date guy.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.839
- You said that was a disaster.
- Oh, it was.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.679
You said he was a chubby loser.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.879
He is.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.399
You didn't mention he has that high phlegmy
voice like he drinks a lot of dairy.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.239
- I know.
- Standing right here, ladies.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.559
Hearing everything.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.799
All right, our cards got switched
so we're just dealing with that.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.479
What happened with Dick?

30:08.480 --> 30:10.799
He just dropped a major bomb on me.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.239
He's married.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.011
No, worse. He's got kids.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.160
Oh, you're still here. Why?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.239
You still have my card. "Why?"

30:24.240 --> 30:29.039
Wait. You're just gonna break up
with him because he has children?

30:29.040 --> 30:32.239
Five children. Five.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.839
What am I, Julie Andrews?

30:33.840 --> 30:37.203
I'm gonna sew matching outfits
and sing to escape the Nazis?

30:37.560 --> 30:40.199
He asked me if I wanted
to be "part of the team."

30:40.200 --> 30:43.439
- No, I don't!
- Maybe you should just go on the trip...

30:43.440 --> 30:46.371
and, you know, spend some
alone time with Dick.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.439
See, he wanted the
kids to come with us.

30:48.440 --> 30:51.919
He wanted me to get to know them in
a "fun and neutral environment."

30:51.920 --> 30:55.283
Eh, five kids? Is his
last name Theodopolis?

30:55.520 --> 30:58.326
- Yes.
- That's incredible. That's my boss.

30:58.560 --> 31:02.879
He owns all the Dick's Sporting Goods.
I manage the one in Ridgefield.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.082
Of course you do.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.359
Dick takes a lot of special needs people,
makes them "managers" of something...

31:09.360 --> 31:12.131
so they can have a business
card and feel important.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.919
Good for you!

31:13.920 --> 31:16.279
That explains it.
That explains a lot.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.039
You know, actually I applied
to work at Closet Queens...

31:19.040 --> 31:22.279
but they said there's already a
gorilla filling that position.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.239
It's a thyroid thing.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.959
- Heh.
- Where was he gonna take you?

31:27.960 --> 31:29.321
Africa.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.639
It was gonna be incredible.
Look at that.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.319
- Sun, sand, safaris.
- Wow.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.490
- Oh, my God.
- He must really like you a lot.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.319
Sorry, I'm not getting it at all.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.807
Okay. And this concludes
our business.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.719
Thank you. Africa.

31:45.720 --> 31:49.319
So he's just gonna go here all
by himself with his kids now?

31:49.320 --> 31:53.239
No. He's heartbroken now.
Nobody gets to go.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.771
Oh, damn it!

31:55.280 --> 31:59.199
Why does he have to have joint custody?
I thought the mother always got the kids.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.679
I mean, this is a week away.
I hope he gets his money back.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.439
- A week out? Not a chance.
- Aah!

32:05.440 --> 32:07.879
Well, maybe they do things
differently in Africa.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.279
I forgot you were an expert at
closets and African refund policies.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.768
Okay. Kick him out. Don't let
him talk to you like that.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.969
- Get out.
- I'm leaving.

32:17.400 --> 32:22.959
Jen. My boys would give anything
to go on a vacation like this.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.479
Mr. Theodopolis. Hi.
It's Jim Friedman.

32:25.480 --> 32:30.959
I don't mean to be a vulture picking on
the carcass of your dead relationship.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.279
But I wonder...

32:32.280 --> 32:34.199
if you'd sell me the vacation...

32:34.200 --> 32:36.839
you were gonna go on with
Freddy Krueger's sister?

32:36.840 --> 32:40.639
I have been saving and saving. I could
never give him full value for it...

32:40.640 --> 32:42.799
but something's better
than nothing, right, sir?

32:42.800 --> 32:44.519
It would just be the three of us.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.199
It would just be the four of
us so we only need one room.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.839
Oh, my God. Wait until
I tell the boys.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.039
Wait till I tell the girls!

32:53.040 --> 32:55.279
We're going to Africa!

33:09.040 --> 33:11.599
<i>Welcome to Africa</i>

33:11.600 --> 33:13.689
<i>Welcome, welcome</i>

33:14.040 --> 33:15.759
I can't believe we're here.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.479
This is pretty cool, Mom.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.839
Yeah.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.559
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome</i>

33:22.560 --> 33:27.399
So I did good? This is better
than, like, bowling and the mall?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.170
Oh, yeah.

33:32.280 --> 33:38.919
<i>- Welcome, welcome
- Africa!</i>

33:38.920 --> 33:42.679
Thank you so much. Thank you.
This is terrific. This is great.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.039
What the fu...?

33:44.040 --> 33:46.879
- Brendan!
- What the fudge is he doing here?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.599
We're going on family
vacations together now?

33:50.600 --> 33:54.486
I have no idea why they
followed us to Africa.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.239
Is this a sick dream? What
is happening right now?

34:03.240 --> 34:05.639
You're stalking my mom!
You're a predator!

34:05.640 --> 34:08.759
Hey! Don't talk to my dad
like that, butthole!

34:08.760 --> 34:11.279
- Language!
- How about you don't correct my daughter?

34:11.280 --> 34:13.438
She can say "butthole"
if she wants to.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.079
- Butthole! Butthole!
- Not you.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.841
I hear thunder on the
mountain. Ha-ha-ha.

34:19.719 --> 34:23.527
Welcome to South Africa.
Mfana at your service.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.918
Mfana.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.319
Uh, Jim. I mean, Dick.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.958
Dick Theodopolis.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.599
Welcome, Dick Theodopolis!

34:31.600 --> 34:36.442
And you are traveling with one
little girl and two, uh...

34:39.239 --> 34:42.409
- Big girls.
- Ha-ha-ha. Of course.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.841
And you must be...

34:43.880 --> 34:45.079
Miss Palmer.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.518
Yes. Jen Palmer.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.119
Oh, I see what you did.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.958
I see what you did too.

34:50.960 --> 34:55.199
Are you ready for the most exciting,
amazing, and romantic week...

34:55.199 --> 34:57.279
of your entire lives?

34:57.280 --> 35:00.529
<i>Exciting, amazing, romantic!</i>

35:01.880 --> 35:05.368
Yeah, we're here for the
zero romance package.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.159
You still haven't told the
children, my friends?

35:08.160 --> 35:09.599
Told the children what?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.919
- Do I have a new mommy?
- Mfana.

35:11.920 --> 35:15.519
Will you do us a favor?
Leave us alone for just two secs.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.199
- Which means "of course."
- Thank you.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.079
All right. Listen. Would you just
reassure my son that we're not dating.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.639
We are not dating! I promise you.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.889
This is not a face I want to
wake up to every morning.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.559
Wow.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.799
You'd be lucky to wake up to that
every day. My mom is frigging hot.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.639
Did you just say your mom was hot?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.279
No! Not hot...!

35:37.280 --> 35:39.369
That's just wrong.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.919
- Tyler! Tyler!
- Whoo!

35:41.920 --> 35:43.839
- Get down from there!
- Wee!

35:43.840 --> 35:47.399
Oh, God! Please, please,
please, please get down!

35:47.400 --> 35:49.887
- Whoo!
- Aah!

35:50.280 --> 35:52.439
This place is ginormous!

35:52.440 --> 35:53.759
Oh, my God!

35:53.760 --> 35:56.486
Follow me. Right this way.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.919
Welcome to your familymoon.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.201
Whoa.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.808
This is so cool.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.199
Now we're talking!
This is Africa, baby!

36:07.200 --> 36:08.439
We'll take this room.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.639
No! We want this room.

36:10.640 --> 36:15.129
Silly Theocropolises!
This is for the children.

36:15.920 --> 36:20.284
This room is for the
mama and the papa.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.879
Look at that bed.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.605
- Huge.
- Awesome.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.239
- This is so cool.
- Look at this candy.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.999
Here is where you make
more Theopotamuses.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.851
My bad.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.439
What part of "not dating"
does this bed fit into?

36:38.440 --> 36:41.039
- Oh, boy.
- Okay. You know what?

36:41.040 --> 36:42.799
Everybody fall into line.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.279
Brendan, Tyler honey,
I need you on the couch.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.199
Hilary, C-SPAN, Lou...

36:47.200 --> 36:48.759
Espn, Espn.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.559
Excuse me. Espn. I'm sorry, honey.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.119
Oh, my God.

36:53.120 --> 36:59.559
Dick was gonna propose to Jen.
A family honeymoon, a "familymoon."

36:59.560 --> 37:02.439
And your dumb friend ruined it.
Here's what's gonna happen.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.359
The first room we saw,
we're gonna take that.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.959
And you and your deranged boys can
have Wilt Chamberlain's headquarters.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.924
Dude, what are you eating?

37:10.680 --> 37:12.006
Mm. "Cherry Pan-ties."

37:12.720 --> 37:16.208
What are "Cherry Pan-ties"?
Let me see that.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.199
- Oh, no! God! Spit it out! Spit it out!
- Why?

37:20.200 --> 37:23.079
Just no Cherry Pan-ties ever!
Out, out, out!

37:23.080 --> 37:26.409
Hey, Mom. I guess this
used to be a firehouse.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.999
Look at this place. Wow.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.479
Hello, Mr. Snuffleupagus.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.444
Heh. Theodopolis.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.205
Hello...

37:49.360 --> 37:50.839
Girls.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.399
- Girls. They're girls.
- That's twice.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.568
Let's go, guys... Girls.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.799
23. We're looking for 23.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.729
There it is.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.039
- Ahem.
- Oh.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.239
- Hi!
- Hey.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.759
How you doing? I think we're
sharing a table with you.

38:10.760 --> 38:15.204
Yeah. Hi! I'm Eddy Wernick and this
is Ginger Wernick and our son, Jake.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.959
We're from Vancouver.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.679
Okay. I'm your son. All right?

38:18.680 --> 38:22.719
Ginger would've had to give birth to
me when she was 6. She's not my mom.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.639
Okay. Get it out
there for everyone.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.839
Sharing it, loving it.
No holding back. That's good.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.719
- All right. Let's do our thing. Come on.
- Isn't this place fantastic?

38:31.720 --> 38:33.839
- So romantic.
- Oh.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.963
Good. Gonna have a nice trip here.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.039
- Um, Dad?
- Hey, sweetie.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.399
Where should I sit?

38:39.400 --> 38:40.999
You can sit anywhere you want.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.521
What about Mom? Where does she sit?

38:43.960 --> 38:45.844
Uh, where do you want her to sit?

38:46.240 --> 38:47.439
Next to me?

38:47.440 --> 38:49.799
Then that's where
she'll sit. Go ahead.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.519
Get right next to Lou.
Your mom's right there.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.999
Okay?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.850
All good.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.161
Ignoring it. Ignoring
the weirdness.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.806
Ah.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.239
Where's the funeral at, boys?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.199
Where's the golf
tournament at, girls?

39:05.200 --> 39:07.599
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.279
Mfana. Mfana!

39:09.280 --> 39:11.599
Yes! Missus, uh...?

39:11.600 --> 39:14.999
Reynolds. Palmer!
Just not his wife, okay?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.039
I don't wanna sit here.
Not gonna happen.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.759
Ha, ha. I'm afraid it
must happen, ma'am.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.279
All tables are filled and
this is your family.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.766
Please sit with us.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.724
You give it a try.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.119
Every family fights.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.919
- You make it better.
- Mm-hm.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.119
- Yes?
- Yes.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.845
Try the chakalaka.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.759
- Hi, new people.
- Hello.

39:37.760 --> 39:42.841
This is Lauren, by the way, and her children,
the karate kids: Wax On and Wax Off.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.039
Isn't this place fantastic?

39:47.040 --> 39:49.766
Oh, it's so romantic.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.971
Sorry, what'd you say?

39:52.240 --> 39:54.363
So romantic!

39:54.440 --> 39:55.679
Easy.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.399
Keeping it classy, huh, Ginger?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.728
Oh, Jakey, you have
something on your face.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.564
Oh, it's a mole.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.279
Hey! You can't sit there.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.448
- Why not?
- My mom's sitting there.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.522
- Is she in the bathroom or something?
- No. She's sitting there right now.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.599
Are you on meds?

40:16.600 --> 40:17.799
Ow!

40:17.800 --> 40:21.083
It's okay, Espn. We'll get
Brendan another chair.

40:21.800 --> 40:22.999
Thank you.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.839
Whatever. I'm just gonna
go to the buffet.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.479
Tyler, come with me. They eat
fried caterpillars here.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.045
Hell, yeah!

40:30.200 --> 40:32.759
Very nice. Girls, why don't
you hit the buffet also?

40:32.760 --> 40:36.519
Larry, make sure you have plenty of beef,
okay? Gotta bulk up for the season.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.085
Love you. Go on.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.926
"Bulk up for the season"?
What is she, a bear?

40:44.360 --> 40:48.599
She's trying out for girls' varsity this
year. A lot of big ladies out there.

40:48.600 --> 40:52.039
- She's gonna eat her way into the starting five.
- My God.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.404
Hello, everybody!

40:57.720 --> 41:00.359
My name is Nickens.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.799
And we are Thathoo!

41:05.000 --> 41:09.159
We play traditional South African
<i>isicathamiya</i> music...

41:09.160 --> 41:13.968
with a little bit of American soul.

41:15.400 --> 41:19.039
- Ha-ha-ha!
- It is getting a little hot in here.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.399
Finally, my huge
African arms are free.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.204
Yeah, baby!

41:26.720 --> 41:28.160
Yes, they are.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.599
No.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.679
I would like to
welcome you to our...

41:32.680 --> 41:36.680
Fourth Annual Blended
Familymoon Week!

41:40.400 --> 41:43.959
- What's a blended family?
- I don't know. It sounds painful, though.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.159
I am looking out at
all you beautiful...

41:47.160 --> 41:50.599
stepchildren, stepdads, stepmoms...

41:50.600 --> 41:55.359
half-brothers, same-sex domestic
partners, and good old-fashioned...

41:55.360 --> 41:57.839
booty calls gone wrong. Ha-ha-ha.

41:59.560 --> 42:03.879
Now, even though the
emphasis is on family...

42:03.880 --> 42:07.599
we here at the beautiful Sun
City Resort want to make sure...

42:07.600 --> 42:11.679
you get some alone time.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.087
Oh...

42:14.880 --> 42:19.559
Because alone time can
sometime take a long time...

42:19.560 --> 42:23.651
we have many supervised activities
for the young ones to do.

42:23.800 --> 42:27.559
<i>We have a fabulous
jungle play zone.</i>

42:32.600 --> 42:35.485
<i>A nightly pool party.</i>

42:36.120 --> 42:40.120
Hey, Espn. Why aren't you getting in?
Is your mom afraid of the water?

42:42.680 --> 42:44.006
Good one, Mom.

42:44.280 --> 42:47.039
<i>Magical animal time.</i>

42:47.040 --> 42:51.848
Little one, wouldn't you like
to try petting a living animal?

42:52.360 --> 42:54.403
He's dead?

42:55.960 --> 43:00.599
<i>And our famous Tekula teen disco!</i>

43:04.200 --> 43:08.007
Hey, dude. There's a lot
of hot chicks out here.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.639
The best time.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.129
What the heck is...?

43:29.640 --> 43:31.205
What is that?

43:32.480 --> 43:34.091
Are you kidding me?

43:34.640 --> 43:36.879
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?

43:36.880 --> 43:38.919
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

43:38.920 --> 43:41.119
Oh, God! Crocodile!

43:41.120 --> 43:42.639
Crocodile attack!

43:42.640 --> 43:45.279
Help me! Somebody help me!

43:45.280 --> 43:47.926
Please don't kill me!
God! Oh, my God!

43:50.080 --> 43:53.887
Mr. Bellyflopolis, the
crocodiles are fake!

43:58.080 --> 43:59.805
They're fake?

44:00.080 --> 44:02.009
Yes, they're fake!

44:02.800 --> 44:06.559
Why would you make
them look so realistic?

44:06.560 --> 44:09.839
Well, to scare the baboons away.

44:09.840 --> 44:14.719
You just scared a zebra
stripe into my underwear!

44:14.720 --> 44:18.959
Don't worry! What happens
in Africa, stays in Africa.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.119
Oh. Oh.

44:28.120 --> 44:30.084
Tyler. Okay.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.279
Excuse me. Oh.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.527
Okay.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.639
That's one way to get him
to sleep through the night.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.759
- You saw that?
- I actually heard it.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.479
I think they heard it in Uganda.

44:46.480 --> 44:48.559
It was a lot easier
when he was Lou's age.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.439
Of course, let me help you out here.
Here you are. You're home.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.279
- Thank you.
- Absol... Oh. Too late.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.479
- Aah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.399
All right, all right, all right.
Pick him up.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.719
Three-second rule.
Three-second rule.

45:00.720 --> 45:03.321
Good, good, good.
You're fine. He's fine.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.923
Okay, now I'm getting scared.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.570
Okay.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.528
Sleep, sleep.

45:28.520 --> 45:33.203
Too hot in here.
No blanket, okay? Shh.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.924
Here's your buddy.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.603
Love ya, love ya.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.123
Mom's sleeping there.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.484
Okay, can I sleep with her?

45:48.800 --> 45:50.525
No, you'll crush her.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.243
No, I could get in with her and
spoon with her. It would be nice.

45:54.360 --> 45:58.007
- I don't wanna see that.
- No. Okay.

45:58.400 --> 46:02.047
We'll let Mommy rest.
I'll, uh... I'll figure it out.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.359
I love you.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.086
- I love you too, Dad. Good night.
- Sleep good.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.999
Me and you there, shorty.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.407
Okay, that's right.

46:13.520 --> 46:18.567
Right on my neck. That's gonna
make a nice evening for me.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.890
Hey, guys. It is time to wake up.

46:43.120 --> 46:47.039
Africa awaits us. It's
a beautiful morning.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.767
- Is he crazy?
- Go away. It's way too early.

46:51.320 --> 46:54.171
Lou, will you wake up
with Daddy, please?

46:54.360 --> 46:58.087
In the name of
Lucifer, let us sleep.

46:59.960 --> 47:04.085
Up, up, up, you two.
I have quite a day planned.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.531
I need a coffee.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.965
Morning.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.479
- Big day planned?
- Oh, yeah.

47:19.480 --> 47:24.159
7:15 nature walk. 8:30 petting zoo.
10:00 a.m. native crafts.

47:24.160 --> 47:26.599
The boys, they're so excited.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.079
Really? My girls are ecstatic also.
Just jumping up and down on the bed.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.439
Can't believe they're here.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.639
- Cream?
- No, thank you.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.003
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.279
- Couldn't get the boys out of bed?
- No.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.479
The girls?

47:42.480 --> 47:45.399
The girls are probably
sleeping the rest of the trip.

47:45.400 --> 47:49.127
Possible exorcism coming for the
little one. We'll see what happens.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.679
Well, it's beautiful here.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.211
Oh, yeah.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.530
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Have a good one.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.880
You won't see that in New Jersey.

48:07.960 --> 48:12.039
Okay. All right. All right. Here we go.
Okay. Here you go, baby.

48:12.040 --> 48:14.719
That's it, sweetie. Take him down.
Take him! That's it.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.002
Back him. Use your weight!
Muscle him.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.079
- Unh.
- Use your body.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.806
- Unh!
- Oh, yeah! Finish it!

48:22.000 --> 48:24.851
- Ugh!
- And bam! That's it! Yes!

48:25.000 --> 48:27.168
Yes! Way to go, Larry.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.479
Winners up. Let's go.
Give me the ball. Buddy.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.125
Up top.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.559
And we go in. Let's go. Get loose.

48:39.560 --> 48:42.684
Cut. Cut! Larry! Move!

48:43.920 --> 48:45.849
Come on. What are you doing?

48:48.080 --> 48:49.799
Larry?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.959
Just cut! Go! Break it.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.889
Shake him off. Come on.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.206
Are you voguing right now?

48:57.200 --> 48:58.731
What is happening?

48:59.160 --> 49:00.725
Here! Just take the ball.

49:01.320 --> 49:03.359
Work the kid. Work him. Lose him.

49:03.360 --> 49:06.279
Cross him. Cross him over.
Cross him.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.879
Don't skip!

49:07.880 --> 49:09.879
Why you moving like that?
Is it the bra?

49:09.880 --> 49:13.209
Because if it's the bra, just take it off.
You don't need it anyways.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.521
What?

49:24.040 --> 49:26.559
What are you doing?
We just started.

49:26.560 --> 49:29.331
Is your boy okay? Why
does he wear a bra?

49:29.880 --> 49:31.206
She's a girl.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.719
You suck.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.879
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck</i>

49:36.880 --> 49:39.003
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck</i>

49:39.160 --> 49:42.239
<i>You suck, you suck, you suck
You schooled by a little girl</i>

49:42.240 --> 49:44.920
<i>Your boy has no skills</i>

49:46.080 --> 49:49.250
<i>You schooled by a little girl</i>

50:00.160 --> 50:01.964
Tyler, slow down!

50:02.280 --> 50:05.399
Come on, Mom! We're going
four miles per hour.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.519
That's plenty fast enough.
Fast and safe.

50:08.520 --> 50:11.159
Miss Palmer! It's okay to go fast.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.919
Oh, okay, Mfana.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.759
Watch me!

50:14.760 --> 50:17.279
Ha-ha-ha. Wee!

50:17.280 --> 50:19.959
- You're going the wrong way!
- Watch out, Grandma!

50:23.400 --> 50:24.726
My bad.

50:25.360 --> 50:29.279
The blending process is
really going well for us.

50:29.280 --> 50:34.239
My husband's 13-year-old still has
some hatred issues towards me.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.959
But it is becoming less
physical, so it's a start.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.638
- That's great.
- Good for you.

50:40.639 --> 50:44.599
I woke up this morning with a
pillow pressed against my face.

50:44.600 --> 50:48.639
But I could sense some guilt
afterwards. So that's progress.

50:48.640 --> 50:52.039
Hang in there, ladies. There's a
light at the end of the tunnel.

50:52.040 --> 50:53.839
This little angel here...

50:53.840 --> 50:57.879
is finally starting to think
of me as her second mom.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.447
Not just her former
gymnastics teacher.

51:00.480 --> 51:02.444
What are you drawing, honey?

51:02.480 --> 51:06.048
It's a picture of elephants stomping
on your head and making you dead.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.608
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Stop it.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.680
Don't worry. What happens
in Africa stays in Africa.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.439
Bump my fist?

51:16.440 --> 51:19.371
- Ha, ha. Jim's so funny.
- Yeah.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.079
My head is boiling,
Mom. Get it off.

51:37.080 --> 51:38.361
I'm trying.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.199
- Why did you tie it with so many knots?
- I didn't want it to come flying off.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.279
Oh, my God! What
happened to her face?

51:45.280 --> 51:48.679
- I painted it. She's a kitty cat.
- Are you wearing eye shadow?

51:48.680 --> 51:52.119
I made Daddy a princess,
but he washed the paint off.

51:52.120 --> 51:55.679
Well, not all the way off because
he looks a little like Lady Gaga.

51:55.680 --> 51:59.646
Why is this kid wearing a helmet? Are you
carrying him to bed again or something?

51:59.680 --> 52:03.359
No, I tied the chin strap too
many times. I can't get it off.

52:03.360 --> 52:07.199
Best thing about working at a sporting
goods store: Swiss Army knives.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.209
- Just be careful.
- I'll go easy.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.959
- Aah!
- Oh.

52:11.960 --> 52:14.199
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

52:14.200 --> 52:17.199
- Daddy, I gotta go to the bathroom.
- You do? Okay.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.765
Can she take me?

52:19.560 --> 52:22.799
She's got her own life to live.
What do you gotta do? One or two?

52:22.800 --> 52:25.446
- Number one.
- I can handle this.

52:26.160 --> 52:27.919
- Okay.
- Will you watch him?

52:27.920 --> 52:31.839
- And I mean watch him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it, home slice.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.079
- Okay.
- For sure.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.079
What's number one again?

52:35.080 --> 52:37.123
It's a pee-pee.

52:39.560 --> 52:42.081
And sometimes he wipes too hard.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.479
I'm sure he doesn't mean to.

52:44.480 --> 52:48.287
No, he's a good daddy.
He just doesn't have a bagina.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.959
Okay, honey. Let's wash your hands.

52:53.360 --> 52:58.559
He's a bad daddy! He made me
look like the walking dead!

52:58.560 --> 52:59.759
Oh, no!

53:01.680 --> 53:03.279
Okay.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.839
All right.

53:04.840 --> 53:07.679
Let's see what we have
in the magic bag here.

53:07.680 --> 53:10.599
Oh. Perfect.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.962
All right. La, da, da.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.966
You're pretty.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.444
You're prettier.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.645
I said you are.

53:22.440 --> 53:25.119
Shut up and let me do your makeup.

53:26.640 --> 53:28.279
Don't worry. They're around.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.879
Oh, I'm not worried.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.605
Maybe that's where they are.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.806
Yeah!

53:34.560 --> 53:35.959
Yeah!

53:35.960 --> 53:37.286
Tyler?

53:37.880 --> 53:39.241
- Hold on, now!
- Excuse me.

53:39.640 --> 53:42.119
- Hold on, big time!
- Aah!

53:45.920 --> 53:49.119
Aah! Oh, my God!
I'm gonna kill him.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.239
Yeah, baby! Hold on, now!

53:53.240 --> 53:54.799
Whoa! Whoa!

53:54.800 --> 53:56.923
Easy, homey, easy!

53:57.160 --> 54:01.319
Tyler! Get off that
dodo bird right now!

54:01.320 --> 54:05.491
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everything's fine.
The safety instructor's on top of it.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.399
Ugh.

54:09.400 --> 54:12.524
Look at me, Mom! I'm a cowboy!

54:12.560 --> 54:15.079
Well, partner, I bet I can
stay on longer than you!

54:15.080 --> 54:16.759
It's on, sheriff.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.883
No "longer"! No "staying"!

54:19.240 --> 54:22.119
- I can't be beat!
- I can't hear you! You're going down!

54:22.120 --> 54:25.722
I'm never gonna fall off! Never!

54:31.000 --> 54:32.719
Whoo! One hand, mama!

54:32.720 --> 54:34.046
Whoo... Aah!

54:35.160 --> 54:37.199
Ooh!

54:37.200 --> 54:38.359
Good!

54:38.360 --> 54:41.564
Yes! I win! I'm the king of Africa!

54:42.880 --> 54:45.879
- Whoa!
- Tyler!

54:49.360 --> 54:51.039
A winner!

54:51.040 --> 54:52.599
Are you kidding me?

54:52.600 --> 54:54.919
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

54:54.920 --> 54:57.999
Wow. Whoo, boom!

54:58.000 --> 55:00.879
You're a moron, okay? Because
he could've broken his neck!

55:00.880 --> 55:05.199
Mom. Mom, Mom. Did you see that?
I stuck the landing and did the bull dance.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.519
I saw it.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.119
Thank you so much for taking
me on this trip, Mom.

55:09.120 --> 55:11.163
This is the best day of my life!

55:11.640 --> 55:15.679
Okay. Great! Oh, good!
Oh, good. I love you so much.

55:15.680 --> 55:19.079
- I'm so glad you're having fun.
- Aw.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.406
You're welcome.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.119
Thank you so much.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.085
- Why you flipping my dad off?
- Huh? I'm not.

55:30.920 --> 55:34.039
Yo! Check out white girl
in the neighborhood.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.641
Am I right, my brothers? Woo-woo!

55:43.440 --> 55:45.919
I can't believe your
dad's into my mom.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.879
He doesn't like her.
She's into him.

55:47.880 --> 55:52.519
No way. He's goofy and flabby all over.
My mom's gorgeous with a rocking body.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.399
Hey, that's sick, man.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.329
That was out of context!

55:56.600 --> 55:58.079
Was it?

56:26.120 --> 56:29.799
You know, you should just go talk to
him because he probably won't bite.

56:29.800 --> 56:32.844
Oh! No, no. I can't.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.119
Got a boyfriend back at home?

56:35.120 --> 56:38.679
Please. All the guys at my school
pretty much assume I'm a lesbian.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.644
And not the hot kind.

56:41.440 --> 56:45.008
Well, have you ever
considered, say, like...

56:45.320 --> 56:46.719
changing your hairstyle?

56:46.720 --> 56:50.119
Our barber only really knows
how to do this and crew cuts.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.679
- So...
- A barber?

56:51.680 --> 56:53.999
Like the kind with a pole outside?

56:54.000 --> 56:57.319
He cut our grandfather's hair.
He cuts my dad's hair.

56:57.320 --> 57:00.729
- And now he cuts our hair. Heh.
- May I just...?

57:02.840 --> 57:04.201
Yup.

57:07.760 --> 57:10.519
You have such a beautiful face.

57:13.360 --> 57:18.168
You know, it's funny because I was
actually on my way to the salon.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.329
Do you wanna come
check it out with me?

57:21.040 --> 57:22.359
For what?

57:22.360 --> 57:24.244
For a hairdo...

57:24.360 --> 57:25.799
for a girl...

57:25.800 --> 57:27.570
in this century.

57:27.880 --> 57:32.199
I would but I'd have to
ask my dad for the money.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.971
No. No, no, no. It's on me.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.487
Really?

57:38.120 --> 57:39.839
It would make me so happy.

57:39.840 --> 57:42.247
Because I don't get to
do this with my boys.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.879
- Come on, Prince Valiant.
- Heh.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.759
- I don't know who that is but okay.
- Okay.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.399
Where do you buy your clothes?

57:52.400 --> 57:54.999
Oh, Dad gets most of
our clothes from work.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.759
Oh, then I guess we should be
grateful he doesn't work at Hooters.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.088
No, my mom worked at Hooters.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.039
She what?

58:03.040 --> 58:07.723
Oh, my mom, she used to work at Hooters.
She managed the one over on Lake Street.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.849
Oh. Heh.

58:19.240 --> 58:22.359
So then he gets down on
one knee and proposes.

58:22.360 --> 58:25.719
Right in the middle
of kickboxing class.

58:25.720 --> 58:28.719
He's lucky he didn't get
kicked in the nuts.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.604
Oh, my nuts! Ha-ha-ha.

58:32.320 --> 58:37.559
Espn. This is the best passion
fruit I've ever tasted. Try it.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.762
And I got some for your mom too.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.159
Thank you.

58:43.160 --> 58:44.719
You're welcome.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.319
So how'd you two sexicans meet?

58:46.320 --> 58:48.959
Yeah! Hitting them with the
hard questions. I like it.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.039
Well, we met on a blind date.

58:51.040 --> 58:54.079
- Argh. Those are the worst.
- Oh.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.359
I've been on 10 blind
dates in my life.

58:56.360 --> 58:59.719
All fatties. Ten for ten.
All fatties.

59:01.400 --> 59:02.886
No offense, Jim.

59:03.680 --> 59:05.039
What?

59:05.040 --> 59:06.810
So what happened?
Where'd he take you?

59:07.080 --> 59:09.359
Actually, Hooters.

59:09.360 --> 59:10.599
Here we go.

59:10.600 --> 59:16.204
Which was wonderful service,
nice people, really great.

59:17.600 --> 59:20.079
Aw. How romantic.

59:20.080 --> 59:23.519
- Oh.
- Aw, everyone's shimmying now.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.719
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy. Ha-ha-ha.

59:25.720 --> 59:28.730
Why you no shimmy, Jimmy? Shimmy.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.287
Jim?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.761
Where's Larry? What
happened to Larry?

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.365
I'm right here, Dad.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.999
Why were the, uh...?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.202
How did this, uh...?

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.369
What's happening right now?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.759
Um, well, Lauren gave me
her salon appointment...

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.999
Uh-huh.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.726
and they put in hair
extensions and makeup...

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.999
and she even told them how to style
it and what to do, what not to do.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.168
She was pretty amazing.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.968
She was amazing, huh?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.039
Do you want to go get
some sushi from the bar?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, scarecrow!
She's gotta bulk up!

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.163
Pork chops! Lamb chops! Tri-tip!

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.359
Uh...

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.369
Let's go get our beef on?

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.159
Uh-oh. I think someone new came to
dinner. A flying baby named Cupid.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.999
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Ping.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.039
Aah! You got me!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.719
Now we're both in love.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.480
What's the matter?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.479
What's the matter?

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.239
I just looked at my daughter,
and I didn't really recognize her.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.090
Kind of threw me off for a minute.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.479
Well, she's 15, you know? She's
bound to grow up at some point.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.079
I know. Call me crazy.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.001
I just thought maybe that would be
my decision because she's my kid!

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.079
Okay! Awkward moment.
Uncomfortable. Tension.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.999
I'm leaving the table.
Who's with me?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.248
- Me! Me!
- I'm going.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.610
Wow.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.159
Whoa. I just...

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.559
Can I ask you?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.970
What made you think you could tart up
my daughter without my permission?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.283
You're right. I'm sorry. I am.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.039
I just find it hypocritical from
someone who nearly killed my son.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.879
So it was getting even? Is that it?

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.559
No, it's not getting
even but I just...

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.519
- She's beautiful.
- Right.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.279
With that pageboy Prince Valiant
haircut you gave her...

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.399
She looked very nice
with that haircut.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.439
and the tracksuit, are you kidding me?
Dying on the inside to come out!

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.168
Her mother was tomboyish at her
age and that was fine with me.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.161
You knew your wife when she was 15?

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.119
I knew my wife when I was 13.
I had a crush on her.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.448
I have no idea why
she liked me back.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.810
I was 90 percent goofy
and 10 percent loser.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.919
Well, I was 60 percent Urkel
and 40 percent Screech.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.199
Put it to you this way: If I didn't have braces,
my teeth would be hitting you right now.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.879
I'm sorry I yelled at you. I feel like a jerk
because I put your kid on a gooney bird...

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.971
- and I didn't ask your permission.
- No, but listen. You're right.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.799
I need to let go of the
reins a little bit.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.721
I just want to say on
behalf of Thathoo...

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.919
how happy we are to see you
two lovebirds finally...

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.319
blending.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.839
No, we're not blending. We were
just having a conversation.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.679
- Just happy we haven't killed each other yet.
- Heh.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.839
<i>Yes, yes, you are blending</i>

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.759
We don't feel that way
about each other!

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.079
<i>Yes, you'll be touching</i>

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.079
<i>Like wine and bobotie</i>

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.199
All right, let's go
and get our beef on!

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.199
<i>And like malva pudding</i>

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.639
All right, thank you.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.559
I think they're blending over there!
Come now! Come now!

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.569
They're blending over here! Yes!

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.639
Daddy, look!

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.091
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.726
What? I thought I saw an eagle.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.767
I saw a camel! Ha-ha-ha.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.919
Hey, Hilary. Uh... You
wanna come in our truck?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.600
Shouldn't you be in your coffin?
The sun's out right now.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.729
Take a walk, homes.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.451
Eh, yo, yo, yo.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.040
Go ahead.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.719
Oh!

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.604
- Oh, my God.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.839
Look, children.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.122
The bush pig has
lost its parents...

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.489
so it is being cared for
by Mama and Papa Lion.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.079
Even in nature there
are blended families.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.639
- That's nice.
- That's sweet.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.359
I may have misread that situation.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.239
- You think so, buddy?
- What is wrong with you?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.399
Yeah, Lauren!

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.965
Yeah, baby!

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.846
- No!
- You can do it, Mom!

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.648
Go Lauren! Go Lauren!

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.929
Whoa.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.406
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.719
Emotional. Time passing. Changes.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.319
It's... it's... It's hard.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.605
You gotta let it go. Turning
the page. Moving on.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.079
She was a little kid just a...

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.239
Processing it. Accepting it.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.599
The circle of life.
Painful, though.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.211
It hurts, right?

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.399
No. Not for me. I got a boy.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.250
But you're in the shithouse.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.880
Thanks.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.479
Whoo! Aah!

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.759
The view is splendid!

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.368
Which mean "who's next?"

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.719
Please, Mom?

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.239
What? That? Are you crazy? No.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.279
If Mfana can do it, I could
do it. It's totally safe.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:28.371
There is no way I'm going
to let you do that.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.879
Unless I try it first...

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.599
- and make sure you can handle it.
- Yes!

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.719
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.888
Your mom is gonna do it.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.159
You have nothing to worry
about. You are in tight.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.159
You got 50-gauge webbing here.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.959
Possibly malaria is the only
thing you gotta think about.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.919
Don't swallow anything
weird up there.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.679
Okay. What happens if, like,
I wanna signal for help...

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.959
- or, like, if I decide to change my mind? Aah!
- Whoa!

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.279
Oh, yeah, baby!

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.718
- You look good!
- Oh, my God!

01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:03.079
I change my mind! I change my mind!

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.199
- Whoo!
- That's awesome!

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.999
Oh.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.521
Wow!

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.611
Oh, my God!

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.879
It's beautiful!

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.319
Go, Mama, go!

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.519
Aah! Aah!

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.238
There are giraffes!

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.118
Jim, there are giraffes right
there! I can see them!

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.519
Well, say hello for me!

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.479
Oh, wow!

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.841
Oh, this is so pretty!

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.919
Oh, my God! Elephants! Elephants!

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.519
Aah!

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.599
- Thatta girl!
- Go Lauren!

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.599
Why is she screaming?

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.599
She's not screaming. She's howling.
She's having fun.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.879
Looking good up there, baby!

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.319
Fly, Mrs. Thorpopolis!
Fly like the wind!

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.724
Tyler! You've gotta try this!

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.251
Why you slowing down?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.724
- We're out of gas.
- You're out of gas? What does that mean?

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.919
We used to have gas.
But now we're out.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.359
Oh.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.764
Oh, my God! What's happening?

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.327
Jim!

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.439
- We're out of gas!
- What?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.078
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God! No!

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.479
This is all your fault!

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.799
Don't worry! My dad's gonna
come up with a plan!

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.970
- What's the plan?
- Look for a gas station.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.399
You suck.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.959
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.198
Listen to me!

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.118
When you get close to the ground...

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.799
start running fast!

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.399
I have the legs of a corgi dog!

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.321
It doesn't matter right now!
Move those little babies!

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.719
You cannot let your kids
see you die like this!

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.639
Go! Go! Go!

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.279
Now! Get those legs going!

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.879
Oh, my God! Rhino!

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.599
- Rhino, rhino!
- Oh, my God!

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.559
Spread them!

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.799
- Oh, my God!
- Spread the legs!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.599
- Aah!
- Her bagina!

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.450
Aah! Cw!

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.606
Yeah!

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.479
Ugh!

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.959
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Dad!

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.445
Ooh.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.088
Aah.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.679
I didn't have you pegged for
the massage type of guy.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.519
It's the first massage I'll
ever do in my life. I have to.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.279
To see if they can rub my
pancreas out of my neck.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.051
My God. You're welcome, by the way.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.250
For what?

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.439
"For what?" For saving you.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.279
You didn't save me.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.119
You told me to keep running.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.879
Why didn't you catch me?

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.399
I was supposed to catch you?
Who am I, Batman?

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.479
Coming at me like
700 miles an hour.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.559
You're weighing about a buck fifty.
The inertia would rip my arms off my body.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.959
Yes. That's me. I weigh a buck fifty.
If I'm holding your left ass cheek.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.559
- I don't know what women weigh.
- You don't know anything.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.479
- Mm-hm. We'll see.
- Have a nice massage.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.039
All right. Now do the
same on your partner...

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.679
while making sure to continue to
look deeply into each others' eyes.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.799
- What is this?
- A scene out of The Doors?

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.079
I don't know. Uh...

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.679
Ma'am? Yeah. I booked a massage.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.566
Yes. You've booked for the
Art of Couples massage.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:23.439
- I just got a call from my babysitter...
- Oh. There was an avalanche in my back yard...

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.319
Come on! This is exactly
what you guys need.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.799
We'll form a massage train.
I'll be the caboose.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.243
- Unacceptable.
- I'm joking.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.999
- Join us.
- No, ma'am.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.039
- I'm so good.
- I'm being totally honest...

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.839
I think you should. This way.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.679
- And there you go.
- Oh, my God.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.199
Okay!

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.610
Let's loosen things up by
stroking your lover's neck.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.329
- Okay
- Come on now.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.279
Don't be bashful.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.486
Give yourself over to the pleasure
of your loving partner's touch.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.885
Yeah.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.205
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.399
Ow.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.239
Remember to keep the touch soft.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.046
Lightly brush your fingers
against her skin.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.807
It's so...

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.799
Oh, God! What's happening?

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.439
- Is there a bug on me?
- No.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.119
There's no bug. I was just trying
to get some skin, like she said.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.719
- Well, that hurts the jugular.
- I won't do it.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.571
I'm sorry. I don't know...

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.322
how to give you a...

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.650
Okay, so...

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.685
- There you go.
- Oh.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.679
- That's actually really nice. Heh.
- Good.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.245
Oh, God.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.919
Oh.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.168
I feel like I'm relaxing.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.079
Oh, it's wonderful.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.959
Excuse me. Am I gonna get some
sort of rub action here...

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.279
or does the guy do all
the work in Africa?

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.970
Very funny, Mr. Moptopolis.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.641
But he's right. Ladies, it's
time for you to join in.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.399
As your partner moves down to
your shoulders, reach out...

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.125
and touch his ears.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.479
Gently rub the lobes between
your thumb and index finger...

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.239
as if you were rubbing
the morning dew...

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.199
- off a flower petal.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.439
- Are these your flower petals?
- Yes.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.166
- Now rub the dew. Ha, ha. Do the dew.
- Heh.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.679
I'd be doing you a really big favor if I
just yanked these goofy things right off.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.645
Oh, just shut up,
schlumpy shoulders.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.239
- I do have schlumpy shoulders.
- No, you don't. They're very nice.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.679
But you know what helps if you
need to work on your posture?

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.959
Here, just lift your arms a little bit.
Watch, I'll show you. Right...

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.411
Feels very good.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.159
- You have nice shoulders.
- Really?

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.799
You really have a lot of muscle.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.239
- Not as much as you.
- Heh.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.039
From carrying that kid around
and smashing his head.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.399
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah!

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.080
Mr. Wernick. Those are not
your wife's shoulders.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.165
Busted!

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.884
Loving it though. Respect
the vision. I get it.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.850
- Gotta go for it, right?
- You do!

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.448
Whoa.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.439
Mm. That was so relaxing.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.719
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.720
I hope I put your pancreas
back where it belongs.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.959
I don't even know where
it is right now.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.919
- Are you my sexy little wormhole?
- Yeah, I'm your sexy little wormhole!

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.130
They have fun.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.279
That's very pretty.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.799
You were very nice. Thank you.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.843
Heh. Oh, you know.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.489
You're a strong woman.
Strong hands.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.004
Mm. I'm glad you like my hands.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.599
Daddy?

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.882
Can Lauren put me to bed?

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.682
Sweetheart, Daddy will put
you to bed in one second.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.919
But I want Lauren.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.602
Lauren... Another time,
Lauren will do that.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.639
But I want her to put
me to bed tonight.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.251
And Daddy said no.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.279
- Mm!
- No.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.079
- Mm!
- No!

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.931
I want Lauren.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.728
I'm flattered.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.331
That's good. You're all right.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.809
Okay. How's that?
Are you all cozy now?

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.639
Yes.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.322
Daddy? Can you give
us some alone time?

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.166
I could go to the bathroom outside.
Is that what you want? You got it.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.284
Thrown out of my own tent.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.690
I own him.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.730
It seems that way.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.920
Can you rub my head so
I have good dreams?

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.530
Of course.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.004
What a cute little head.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.763
Ew.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.164
Couldn't go a little
further from the tent?

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.486
What do you want from me? There could
be gorillas out here, ready to kill.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.639
Well, why don't you get them to
give you some Flomax or something.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.286
Yep, getting older.
I'll give you that.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.043
Can you sing to me?

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.249
Um, sure.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.249
What should I sing?

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:21.085
<i>Somewhere over the rainbow</i>

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.281
<i>Way up high</i>

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.482
<i>There's a land that I heard of</i>

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.841
<i>Once in a lullaby</i>

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.959
<i>Someday I'll wish upon a star</i>

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:46.327
<i>And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me</i>

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.239
<i>Where troubles melt
like lemon drops</i>

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.924
<i>Away above the chimney tops</i>

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.479
<i>That's where</i>

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:06.609
<i>You'll find me</i>

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.759
- There's a gorilla right there!
- Aah!

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.319
I'm just kidding! I'm sorry!

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:42.359
I'm sorry, I just couldn't handle how
emotional it was getting. I just... I'm sorry.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.450
Get some rest. I didn't
mean to do that to you.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.319
So get in your stance.
That's right.

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.959
And spread your legs just
a little bit. Like an inch.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.199
Elbow up. It's all about balance.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.846
That's right. That's right.
Keep your weight right there.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.879
How do you even play cricket?

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.039
We're not playing cricket.
We're playing baseball.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.519
The only thing at the hotel they had
was this stupid battle thingamajiggy.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.719
Who's that guy?

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.959
He's some guy named Dale.
Uh, he'll be pitching to you.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.079
Yeah, in cricket we
don't pitch, we bowl.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.279
Hey, Dale. How much
am I paying you?

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.960
Five Brooklyn T-shirts from
your sporting goods store.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.521
Okay, I'm gonna make it four
if you correct me again.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.561
All right, Dale. Pitch...
Or bowl one in.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.679
- I stink at this.
- No, it's not you. It's not you.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.759
Dale, you think maybe you can
reach the plate? That would help.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:39.167
Actually, in cricket
we bounce the...

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.319
I'll try. I'll try.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.171
All right. Elbow up.
Come on. Get there.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.319
I don't wanna do this!

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.679
Hey. What are you doing?

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.559
You don't throw your bat.
Or whatever this thing is called.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.319
- A bat.
- Thank you.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.286
You're an athlete. You're a sportsman.
You gotta respect your equipment.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.479
- Yes, sir.
- We ain't leaving here...

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.650
till you hit the ball as
good as you ride an ostrich.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.851
Pick up the bat.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.079
Hey. I know you're
up there all alone.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.719
It's scary. You feel like all
the pressure's on you.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.924
But guess what?
The pressure is on him.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.481
Doesn't look like he's
feeling the pressure.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.199
Oh, he's feeling it all right. He doesn't
think he can get the ball past you.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.042
I want you to look him right in the
eyes and let him know you own him.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.279
Go ahead. That's it, big time.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.686
Give him the stink eye.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.399
What's his problem?

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.599
Well, look at that.
You rattled him.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.804
Okay. Dale, pitch it
in if ya got the guts.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.359
Whoa!

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.439
Yes! Did you see that? I killed it!

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.199
Let's do it a hundred more times.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.239
If I hit like that, my dad's
gonna start coming to my games.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.679
What's going on here?

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.486
Jim just taught me how to
make the pitcher my bitch.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.046
Ah-ah-ah.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.279
My brother doesn't need you
to teach him how to hit!

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.448
Okay. You wanna show
him how to do it?

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.079
Let's see what you got.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.442
I don't need to prove
anything to you, d-bag.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.846
Dale, did he really
just call me a d-bag?

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.963
This shit just got real.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.759
I'm gonna kill you.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.930
Okay, we'll see. Let's get your
gloves up. Face protected.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.519
Kick his ass, Brendan!

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.679
- What's that?
- Kick his ass, Jim!

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.319
Uh-huh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.359
You see, you gotta
look at your target.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.645
How about I put a picture of your babysitter
on my face? Will you look at it then? Huh?

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.359
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Just leave her out of this!

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.759
Use your right hand.
You're better with that one.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.361
- All right, all right. Boom.
- Oh!

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.719
- You seem pissed at me.
- You just hit me!

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.799
No! Before that. Before that,
like when we first met.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.919
- Just think that my mom could do better.
- First of all, she can't do better.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.559
Because no one's better than me.
I am the greatest.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.839
Secondly, I think it's nice that
you wanna protect your mommy.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.279
I hate you!

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
Calm down. That was good though.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.399
Showing a little something in there.
Listen, being a man...

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.799
ain't about pissing and moaning
anytime something's bothering you.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.243
It's about dealing with what's in
front of you. So deal with me.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.601
Are you okay?

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.321
That was sneaky. But I'm fine.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.561
Does that make me a man now, Jimbo?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.679
No.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.565
Asking me if I was okay,
that was a start.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.889
<i>They are blending</i>

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.809
<i>They are bonding</i>

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.291
Yeah, that's great. Didn't know you guys
worked out together, but it makes sense.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.604
<i>When one person</i>

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.679
<i>Meets another</i>

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.121
<i>Come together</i>

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.399
<i>Oh, they are blending</i>

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.879
And then what happened?

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.199
The bowler threw it, and I
hit it like a mile away.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.199
Yeah. And then Jim
taught me how to box.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.599
And after 5 minutes,
I basically knocked him out.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.799
Yeah!

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.809
Well, that was nice of him.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.079
Kind of worked out well,
they came on this trip.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.011
Yes, it did.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.719
<i>Lauren, you looked so hot in this
dress, I had to buy it for you.</i>

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.719
<i>And by "buy," I mean "steal."</i>

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.729
<i>Hope you're having
fun on my vacation.</i>

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.479
So its tongue was ridiculous.
It got me, like, all over.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.719
It was, like, in balls.
They were like:

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.129
Like a stem going against
each other, head-to-head.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.799
Dad. Did you comb your hair?

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.239
No. Got out of the shower
like this, I guess.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.851
You took a shower?

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.239
I shower! I'm allowed
to shower. My God.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.919
- I haven't taken a shower since we got here.
- I know. You stink. I love it.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.399
Yeah, I stink bad.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.843
Yeah, you stink real bad.
Your breath smells terrible.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.726
Where's Lauren?

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.319
Wow.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.839
- Look at Mom.
- Hello.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.405
Dad! Say something to her.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.879
Yes, yes. You look very, very nice.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.526
Oh, well, thank you. You showered.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.599
Am I really known as the non-shower
guy? I shower all the time, guys.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.759
<i>No, he doesn't.</i>

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.639
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.679
it's the final night...

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.359
of our blended family
experience here in Africa.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.639
Our tradition is to invite the
kiddies to the pool area...

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.159
for our famous kids-only
safari buffet...

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.919
and 10-foot chocolate
rain forest fountain!

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.359
Can we go, Dad?

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.879
All right, go ahead.
Stay with you sisters though.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.639
My boy here's a chocoholic.
You better watch out.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.599
Or he's gonna jump in and come out
looking like a handsome Hershey bar.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.730
Did you see that?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.488
I made him smile. He tried not
to but he couldn't help himself.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.489
- We're gonna be a great family.
- Yes, we are.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.599
Love you.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.486
All of the little ones have gone.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.331
Tonight the dining room is:

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.242
Adults-only.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.959
Yeah, now we're getting there.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.319
Let's have all you blended
lovers on the dance floor.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.359
<i>Love</i>

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.963
<i>Is a many blended thing</i>

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.724
<i>It's the April rose</i>

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.759
<i>That only grows
In the early spring</i>

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.079
It's crazy, huh?

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.399
The song.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.039
He took the word "splendid"
and replaced it with "blended."

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.639
So clever. It rhymes!

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.399
But, the real word is "splendored."

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.329
So wouldn't it be "blendored"?

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.999
What's this now?

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.999
I'm just rambling.
I'm sorry. What...?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.719
- Heh.
- Are you ready, Mr. Chiapetolis?

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.400
"Chiapetolis"? All right.
He finally got it.

01:28:23.401 --> 01:28:28.559
- Heh. Ready for what?
- You scheduled a star-gazing experience.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.886
So...

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.164
Mrs. Chiapetolis, would
you like to come join me?

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.639
- Oh. Yeah.
- All right.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.639
<i>Once</i>

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.287
<i>High on a windy hill</i>

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.439
<i>Or two hills, that's good</i>

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.884
<i>On a morning mist,
Two lovers kiss</i>

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.159
Just a little bit farther.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.119
- All right. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.044
Here we are.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.004
Dinner for two.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.439
Oh, yeah.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.719
Wow.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:06.999
This is good.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.279
I gotta give it up to Dick. He's probably
the most romantic guy on the planet.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.211
Yeah, he's got the moves.
No doubt about it.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.399
I bet this is where he was
gonna ask Jen to marry him.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.599
Maybe.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.799
We were able to get everything
you asked for this morning...

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.679
except the sticks of cheese
in the shape of a heart.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.370
Cheese sticks?

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.559
Did you set this up?

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.205
I wanted a do-over.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.204
For that first date fiasco.

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.966
I'm better than that.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.367
Which means:

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:49.599
"Lovers long for the moment their
souls may blend in a whisper."

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.883
- Mm.
- May this be your moment.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.879
Did you eat pork chops...

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:59.279
with tuna fish today at lunch?

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.679
- Yes, I did.
- I can tell.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.965
Apologies. I will brush my teeth
presently, Mr. Lollipopolis.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.239
I'd brush them twice. And did you
really call me "Lollipopolis"?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.559
It's Theodopolis.
Just for the record.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.569
I know. I just like to have fun...

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.159
Jim Friedman.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.045
- Wha...?
- What?

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.599
- That was good.
- Thank you, Mfana.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.599
How about Thathoo
showing up everywhere?

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.441
They were in my shower this morning.
I had a very nice time with them too.

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.959
There she is. Oh,
thank you so much.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.369
Hey, Bubbles. Nice wiggle, but
you grew a tail. Ha-ha-ha.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.519
Here's looking at you.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.167
No, really. Looking at you, because
you're actually looking at me this time.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.000
You...

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.801
have the most beautiful...

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.681
kids.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.046
- Oh. Thank you.
- Sure.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.483
You're a great mom too.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.840
You're a pretty good mom yourself.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.806
I'll take that.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.639
Tyler has a playoff
game on Saturday...

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:18.887
Yeah?

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.363
and I think that...

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:30.199
for the very first time, he won't actually
be completely dreading it, thanks to you.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.239
Tell your... His father the more he works with
him, the more he's gonna get confident...

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.839
the more he's gonna belt the
ball anytime he gets up there.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.319
Yeah, well, his dad's not really
into working with him, you know...

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:46.162
because to do that, he'd have to show
up, which he's just not good at.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.519
You gotta show up for your kids.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.202
It should be boring how
reliable a parent is.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.839
It's funny to me that some
people don't get that. You do!

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.919
I mean, your kid needs to come
first 100 percent of the time.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.088
Absolutely. 99 percent.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:07.239
One percent of the time, I think we
are allowed to get what we want.

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.759
Aah. God.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.282
I forgot what it was
like to want something.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.608
I vaguely remember it feels good.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.919
I can't do this.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.282
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.323
I really... I'm... It's not you.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.968
I thought I could
do this. I just...

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.009
Sorry about them too.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.205
They're still awesome.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.203
Sorry I did that to you.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.323
<i>He didn't kiss you?</i>

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.531
He's an idiot.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.919
Although, you have to admit. The
monkeys playing the violins and stuff?

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.610
That is hilarious.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.439
I can't believe that we both
found these great guys...

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.439
and we're not gonna
end up with them.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.085
Are you gonna get that?

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.968
Hi. It's not a good time right now.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.559
I L word you so hard.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.359
And you know what? I am
gonna make L word to you...

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.079
for at least an hour and a half.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.081
Okay.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.039
That was my mom.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.810
And she's doing good.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.921
All right. I'm giving
Dick another chance.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.606
To do what? Get rid of his kids?

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.406
I'm gonna meet his children. Heh.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.006
You should try saying that without
contorting your face so much.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.287
I'm gonna meet his children.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.762
Heh. Better.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.005
I'm sorry about Jim.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.446
Me too.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.129
Why didn't you kiss her, man?

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.691
I couldn't. I just...

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.367
I was afraid it wasn't
the right thing to do.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.286
What did Africa do to you?

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.808
- That doesn't hurt. Stop.
- Ow.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.210
I'm trying my best. Just sit still.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.999
- Does it look pretty?
- It looks fantastic. Yeah.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.850
Yay.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.289
Ha-ha-ha. No.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.639
- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.559
- Where you off to?
- Oh, I'm going on a date with Jake.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.439
How can you go out with Jake?
He lives in Vancouver.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.999
<i>Hi, Mr. Friedman.</i>

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.839
Yay there, Skeletor. Listen,
make sure plenty of beef.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.883
Seriously. She's got
tryouts this week.

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.966
<i>Lamb chops, pork chops,
tri-tips. You got it.</i>

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:37.959
That's the way.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.679
Garbage twisties?

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.679
- I don't know how to...
- You're awful.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.199
Just fix it then.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.402
So when are we gonna
see Lauren again?

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.799
Something happened
between you guys.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.319
No. What are you, crazy?
Nothing happened.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.679
Dad, come on. I saw the
way you looked at her.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.439
- And I saw the way she looked at you.
<i>- It's undeniable.</i>

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.839
<i>- You guys are infatuated with each other.</i>
- Jake, butt out.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.999
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.839
Don't you guys have anything better to do
than look at people looking at each other?

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.039
Besides, what am I supposed to do?

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:09.244
Change our whole lives just
because I'm in love with her?

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.680
Yes!

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:17.039
Wow.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.599
<i>Aah! So romantic!</i>

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.168
<i>Loving it! Taking a risk.
Go get her, baby!</i>

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.799
I know I confused you.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.890
I just had to make sure.

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.999
For my wife and for my kids.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.885
And for your kids.
And for you. And...

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.239
Just so we have no lies.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.279
It was me who drank
your beer at Hooters.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.359
I don't know why I did that.
I get free beers there...

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.040
so it was just panic then.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.881
Yeah?

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.282
This is 323, right?

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.966
Yeah.

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.449
I was looking for Lauren.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.411
You and me both.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.287
Jim!

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.928
Big time! Look at you!

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.647
Mom's not home. This is my dad.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.441
Mark.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.159
Yeah. Who are you?

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.089
Jim! The cool guy from the safari.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.041
Do you wanna "bowl"
me a few pitches?

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.441
I'm sure your father wants
to do that with you.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.439
No, he doesn't.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.246
No, no, no, no. Go get
your bat, big time.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.279
Hey! We can all play!

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.482
I'll get Brendan's glove.
He never uses it.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.919
Boy, he hasn't shut up
about that Africa trip.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.851
Your kids are incredible.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.119
Yeah.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:59.199
That's why Lauren and I are, you know,
trying to make things work again.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.640
For them.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.079
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.039
I'll tell her you came by.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.403
And I'll put these
in the bedroom...

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:11.968
next to where we make love.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.571
Okay.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.811
Tell Tyler I said goodbye.

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.685
Where's Jim going?

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.289
He had stuff to do, I guess.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.639
- Can you and me play then?
- Yeah, of co...

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.447
Ooh. Saved by the bell.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.330
Hey, what's up?

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.405
You busy?

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.767
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.119
Is there a <i>GQ</i> photo
shoot going on here?

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.642
Oh, no. I'm just, uh...
I'm just chilling.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.603
I'm sorry that took so long. Thank
you for watching after the boys.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.399
I'm done now and I'm guessing you
have somewhere you gotta go so...

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.170
How do you always look so great?

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:35.039
Yeah? It's my haven't-washed-
my-hair-in-three-days look.

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.719
Thanks for noticing.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.161
Heh. You're so funny.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.919
It's hard for me to imagine
you with someone else.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.559
Really? It wasn't hard for
you to imagine yourself...

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.719
with someone else when
you cheated on me.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.319
You always bring it back to that.
I could say, "Hey, look at that house."

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:54.399
And you'd say, "Oh, we lived in a
house when you cheated on me."

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.239
Or I could say, "Pass that pickle."
And you could say, I don't know.

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.919
Something about a pickle
and you cheating on me.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.679
It's fun to laugh with
you again, Lauren.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.530
We used to do that all the time.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.410
You brought flowers?

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:10.887
Yeah.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.290
Why'd you bring flowers?

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.728
Because you deserve flowers.

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.681
Lauren, when you went away to
Africa, I did a lot of thinking.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.799
You and I, we have so much
history together. Two boys.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.119
One receptionist.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.119
Look, I made a mistake!

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.239
You made it at least four
mistakes that I know of.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.959
Made. Past tense.

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.003
I was a jerk.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.806
Lauren, you were the
best thing in my life.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.286
You and the boys.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.804
And boys need their fathers.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.726
They do.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.362
I know that I'm a good father.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.559
I just need to prove it to them.

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.081
Well, you can! It's not too late.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.279
Is it too late...

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.891
for this?

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.919
What are you doing?

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.599
I'm coming home, baby.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.485
Oh! Mark! Get off of me!

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.449
You don't live here anymore!

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:14.920
Is there someone else?

01:41:14.921 --> 01:41:19.364
Heh. No. And that's none
of your business anyway.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.799
You're interested in
being a good father?

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.287
Tyler has a game on
Saturday. Be there.

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.851
Dad?

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.402
I didn't mean to wake you. Sorry.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.002
I was talking to Mom before bed.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.759
- Mm-hm.
- And...

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.601
she says she has a
lot of stuff to do.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.087
She does?

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.211
Yeah. So she might not be
able to hang around as much.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.925
Okay.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.245
She also said you need to increase
my allowance to 5 dollars.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.129
She's very generous.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.885
I just...

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.287
I don't want her to disappear.

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.959
Sweetheart, she's never
gonna disappear.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.446
Never ever.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:44.359
You can let her go. She
will always be right here.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.803
And I will always be here.
I promise you.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.239
By the way...

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.727
Mom loved the Africa trip.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.885
So did I.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.686
I miss her.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.368
Your mother was the greatest.

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.084
I mean Lauren.

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:21.966
Me too.

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.645
We don't have to let
go of her too, do we?

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.930
Come here.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.039
Brendan, don't forget that I'm
picking you up for Scouts...

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:43.685
so don't take the bus home.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.879
Thanks for telling everyone
I'm still in Scouts, Mom.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.481
You're a good boy. Be
proud of who you are.

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.925
<i>Love you.</i>

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.048
Say one word and you're dead.

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.522
You're driving a minivan.

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.159
It's Dick's.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:22.523
I'm off to buy toilet paper
for Team Theodopolis.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.159
When the team needs toilet paper,
the co-captain goes and gets it.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.931
And believe me, those
kids never stop crapping.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.439
Kids need to crap.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.803
You need anything from Walmart?

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.847
I'm good.

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.844
- See you at the PTA meeting.
- Okay, foxy.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.361
Yeah! Base on!

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.079
This is so good, honey.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.204
- This is family.
- This is fun for me.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.639
- Way to go, Dad.
- One out to go.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.959
But Standard Fence
has a rally going.

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:19.359
Now batting, number
23, Tyler Reynolds.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.879
- Hey, that's not nice!
- Shut up. That kid's awful.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:27.319
Go Tyler!

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.760
Tracy.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.369
What's your head doing here?

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.643
Strike one!

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.804
I'm so sorry Mark didn't show up.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.404
He just doesn't get it, you know? Your kids
have to come first 100 percent of the time.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.570
Well, like, 99 percent. You
get one percent for yourself.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.885
- That's great news.
- Heh.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.489
Well, no matter what, you have
to show up for your kids.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.879
Like him.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.359
- Hey, hey! All right, big time!
- Come on, Tyler!

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.244
Looking good out there!

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.605
Get that elbow up!

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.166
Elbow up!

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.170
Incredible.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.961
Come on, Tyler.

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.599
Strike two!

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.086
All right, all right!

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.719
Nice cut, nice cut. Slow
it down a little bit.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.879
Bend those knees. Balance, okay?

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.479
Take care of this. That's it.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:49.603
Elbow up. Higher, higher.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.879
Now, remember the stink eye.

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:57.839
The mustache is rattled.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.319
Come on, Tyler, let's go!

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.010
Take them deep.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.201
You hit it!

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.279
Run, Tyler, run!

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.641
Keep going, brother! Go!

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.806
Go now!

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.729
Don't hesitate. Come, come!

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:41.679
Come to me, big time!

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.406
Go! Run to me!

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.479
Keep it going, Tyler!

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.489
We're going home, baby!

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.524
We're going home!

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.399
Safe!

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:56.409
Yeah! Yes!

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.041
Do you believe in miracles?

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.599
Yeah! Whoo!

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.247
Yeah! That's my brother!

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:11.604
Ha, ha! Whoo.

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:13.559
Thank you.

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:16.127
All you in there, big time.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.404
Oh, my God!

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.891
What are you doing?

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.285
I love you!

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.879
That was amazing.

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:31.319
I'm so sorry to show up like this.
I was at your house the other day...

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.879
and I saw your ex-husband blow off
Tyler when he wanted to practice.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.209
I know you guys are trying to work
it out, but it broke my heart.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.491
We're not working it out.
That's never gonna happen.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:42.967
Really?

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.961
What were you doing at my house?

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.806
I came by to tell you that...

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.164
I think it's okay now.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.639
Okay for what?

01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.399
Okay to have one of those
rare, rare moments...

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.329
where we get what we want.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.759
Oh.

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.644
Well, what do we want?

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.170
You know what we want.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.848
Yeah. I think the kids want it too.

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.479
Not as much as I do there,
schlumpy shoulders.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.050
Wait.

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.330
I can't do this.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:25.521
You're kidding me.

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.959
Heh. Totally. I just had to
get you back for Africa.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.241
Come on.

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.719
You know something?

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.959
Your mom is hot.

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.083
Your dad's pretty hot too.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.679
Not hot.

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.559
Come on, you deserve
a nice massage.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.519
- Ow! Oh, it's good.
- Come on, you like that.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.961
- Oh, it hurts so good.
- Sorry.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.319
<i>Look, they're blending</i>

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.199
<i>Hearts are mending</i>

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.479
<i>Sad times ending
Good times spending</i>

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:09.886
<i>With love</i>

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.479
<i>Kids are friending</i>

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.886
<i>Wedding trending</i>

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.239
<i>Blending, friending, blending, friending
Movie ending</i>
