NO. NOT FROM THE WAY

BACK HERE AFTER SHE

THAT WAS--SHE NEEDED
A PLACE TO STAY.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.114

RIGHT OUT WHEN YOU
WENT TO GET DAPHNE.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.161
SHE WENT BACK
TO SEE HER PARENTS.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.119
AND SHE WENT OUT
AND GOT HER OWN APARTMENT.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.686
SHE LIKES YOU,
CHARLIE,

06:22.686 --> 06:25.254
BUT SHE THINKS
THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE HER BACK.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.995
NOW, WHO'S GONNA
STICK AROUND
FOR THAT?

06:26.995 --> 06:29.693
OK. IF THAT'S
HOW SHE FELT--

06:29.693 --> 06:31.478

THAT IT'S NOT--

KEEP IT A SECRET?

06:33.610 --> 06:36.744
I DON'T KNOW.

FELT THAT WAY
ABOUT HER...

THAT A SECRET?

OTHER OR SOMETHING.

JUST A LITTLE SAD.

WHAT CITY TO LIVE IN.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.777
WHICH--SORRY,
WHICH--WHICH CITY?

10:03.777 --> 10:06.954
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING TYING ME DOWN,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.217
AND IT FEELS LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO TRY

10:09.217 --> 10:11.349
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO,

10:11.349 --> 10:15.223
LIKE TEACHING
AND TRAVELING AND...

10:15.223 --> 10:16.616
FARAWAY PLACES.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.313
YOU JUST RENTED
THIS PLACE.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.924
YEAH, BUT THE MANAGER SAYS
I CAN ALWAYS SUBLET.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.582
CHARLIE, WHAT?

10:26.582 --> 10:28.628
YOU THINK I SHOULDN'T?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.283
YOU THINK I'M, LIKE,
RUNNING AWAY FROM
MY PROBLEMS OR WHATEVER?

10:32.283 --> 10:33.502
NO.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.112
I DON'T KNOW.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.114
[LAUGHS]

10:37.114 --> 10:38.638
YOU THINK I SHOULD STAY?

10:51.041 --> 10:54.262
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD STAY HERE?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.699
I THINK THAT...

10:56.699 --> 10:59.136
YOU SHOULD DO WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO,
KIRSTEN.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.573
I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

11:01.573 --> 11:02.836
IT'S UP TO YOU.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.019
I'M TRYING
TO SHOW YOU SOME
PICTURES HERE.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.237
COULD YOU SETTLE DOWN?
COME HERE.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.891
WHEN'S CLAUD GETTING HOME
FROM SCHOOL?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.154
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW. HERE.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.721
LOOK AT THESE.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.854
HERE, LOOK
AT THIS ONE.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.421
THIS IS YOUR FIRST
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.859
SEE? THERE'S MOM
LIGHTING
THE CANDLES,

11:25.859 --> 11:27.599
AND THAT'S DAD
HOLDING YOU,

11:27.599 --> 11:30.080
AND THAT'S ME,
AND THAT'S JULIA,
AND THAT'S CHARLIE.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.429
LET'S GO PLAY
A GAME, OK?

11:31.429 --> 11:33.214
WAIT. IN A MINUTE.
IN A MINUTE.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.520
CAN WE PLAY FOOTBALL,
BAILEY, OUT IN THE YARD?

11:35.520 --> 11:38.088
COME ON.
I NEVER GET TO THROW
STUFF AT YOUR HOUSE.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.742
MY HOUSE?

11:39.742 --> 11:42.832
HEY, THAT'S
YOUR HOUSE, TOO.
REMEMBER?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.225
THE SWING
IS THE TOUCHDOWN.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.575
BET YOU CAN'T TACKLE ME
BEFORE I SCORE.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.185
GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.

11:48.185 --> 11:51.014
GIVE ME THOSE KEYS!

11:51.014 --> 11:54.104
HEY. HEY!
NO FAIR TICKLING!

11:54.104 --> 11:55.453
FLAG ON THE PLAY!

11:55.453 --> 11:57.760
AHA!
TOO BAD, BUDDY.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.675
BAILEY
TAKES POSSESSION.

11:59.675 --> 12:03.026
OK, IT'S FOURTH
AND GOAL
FOR SAN FRANCISCO.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.636
HUT, HUT, HUT!

12:04.636 --> 12:07.204
BAILEY, I'M OPEN!
I'M OPEN!

12:07.204 --> 12:08.597
HEY, YOU GUYS.
WHAT'S UP?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.730
CHARLIE, GO DEEP!
OWEN, YOU PLAY DEFENSE!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.082
HO!

12:15.082 --> 12:15.822
YES!

12:19.608 --> 12:21.262
LATERAL, BAILEY,
LATERAL!

12:21.262 --> 12:22.742
HEY, THAT'S
AGAINST THE RULES.
YOU'RE DOWN!

12:26.702 --> 12:28.922
DOG PILE!

12:28.922 --> 12:30.358
[ALL LAUGHING]

12:30.358 --> 12:32.142
[WOOF]

12:40.716 --> 12:42.500
GOOD SHOW.
ALL RIGHT.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.154
HEY, CLAUDIA.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.677
THANKS FOR COMING.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.070
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.419
OH, YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.725
OH, THANKS.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.379
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE BACK, ROSS.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.861
OH, ME, TOO.
8 MONTHS ON THE ROAD
IS 8 MONTHS TOO MANY.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.428
SO WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE CONCERT?

12:57.428 --> 12:59.387
WELL, IT...

12:59.387 --> 13:02.259
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
I'M ABOUT TO GET
A RAVE REVIEW.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.957
OH, NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.697
YOU WERE--
YOU WERE GREAT.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.264
IT'S JUST...

13:07.264 --> 13:09.310
ALL THAT RUSSIAN
MELANCHOLY.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.703
EVERYTHING'S
SO TEARFUL AND...

13:11.703 --> 13:13.357
PAINFUL, IT JUST...

13:13.357 --> 13:16.708
I DON'T KNOW,
IT KIND OF FELT
OVER THE TOP.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.145
OK, WHAT'S WRONG?

13:18.145 --> 13:20.669
NOTHING.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.323
OH, COME ON.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.326
CLAUDIA SALINGER
NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR TCHAIKOVSKY?

13:27.023 --> 13:29.286
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, OK?

13:29.286 --> 13:30.940
OK.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.637
FINE.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.683
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU

13:34.683 --> 13:36.598
TO THE REST
OF THE ENSEMBLE.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.469
I TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT
MY FAVORITE STUDENT.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.383
ROSS.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.779
I DO WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.088
YOU'RE LIVING IN
A DREAM WORLD, JULE.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.090
WHY, BECAUSE
I'M AN OPTIMIST?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.092
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN
SECOND CHANCES?

13:52.092 --> 13:55.138
NO. BECAUSE YOU JUST...

13:55.138 --> 13:57.140
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.012
I MEAN...

13:59.012 --> 14:01.753
YESTERDAY THIS WAS
EASY FOR ME.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
I MEAN, KIRSTEN
WAS JUST A FRIEND.
I COULD CALL HER,

14:04.104 --> 14:06.367
I COULD SEE HER.
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.195
BUT NOW, EVERY TIME
HER NAME COMES UP,

14:08.195 --> 14:10.632
I FEEL LIKE THIS--
THIS TWINGE OR...

14:10.632 --> 14:14.027
PANG, OR WHATEVER.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE BREAKING UP AGAIN.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.899
CHARLIE, I GET IT,
BELIEVE ME.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.509
OK. SO WHY WOULD I
WANT TO DO THIS?

14:18.509 --> 14:20.642
WHY WOULD I WANT TO
PUT MYSELF THROUGH THAT AGAIN?

14:20.642 --> 14:23.253
BECAUSE MAYBE
IT'LL WORK THIS TIME.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.907
YOU KNOW?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.909
IT'S 2 YEARS LATER.
MAYBE YOU GUYS
ARE DIFFERENT.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.432
MAYBE YOU'RE READY
FOR STUFF

14:28.432 --> 14:29.825
THAT YOU WEREN'T
READY FOR
THE FIRST TIME.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.827
JULIA, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.874
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT
THIS WHOLE ENTIRE HISTORY.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.919
BUT YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--

14:36.919 --> 14:39.966
YOU'RE FRIENDS NOW.
YOU'RE PAST ALL THAT.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.532
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.794
WELL, THEN WHY WON'T YOU
AT LEAST--

14:42.794 --> 14:44.709
BECAUSE SHE'S MADE HERSELF
VERY CLEAR.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.407
I MEAN, SHE HASN'T BEEN
AROUND HERE IN WEEKS.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.236
SHE'S THINKING ABOUT
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.195
I MEAN, SHE DOESN'T
WANT THIS, JULIA.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.196
SO...

14:53.196 --> 14:55.285
I'M NOT GONNA PUSH IT.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.424
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT,
SARAH.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.078
BAILEY THREW THIS PASS,

15:05.078 --> 15:07.689
AND HIS KEYS FELL
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THURBER,

15:07.689 --> 15:09.691
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
GOT THEM BACK,

15:09.691 --> 15:12.041
THEY WERE TOTALLY COVERED
IN DOG MOUTH SLIME.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.087
HA HA!
I'M SORRY I MISSED THAT.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.089
CAN I HAVE SOME MORE
ROCKY ROAD, PLEASE?

15:16.089 --> 15:18.439
NO. I THINK 2 SCOOPS
WILL DO YOU, BUDDY.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.788
WHY DON'T YOU GO...

15:19.788 --> 15:21.659
BRUSH MY TEETH. OK.

15:24.575 --> 15:28.405
WOW. I DON'T THINK
I'VE SEEN HIM
THAT EXCITED SINCE--

15:28.405 --> 15:30.059
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.626
I KNOW.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.019
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
TODAY.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.672
I HAD TO DRAG HIM
OUT OF THERE.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.719
YEAH, I HEARD.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.679
HE TOLD YOU?

15:41.679 --> 15:44.291
NO. HE TOLD CLAUDIA
DURING PHONE TIME.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.075
PHONE TIME?

15:46.075 --> 15:48.208
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT HE LIKES
TO CALL THE HOUR

15:48.208 --> 15:50.340
THAT HE SPENDS ON THE PHONE
WITH HER EVERY DAY.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.038
HE TELLS HER EVERYTHING.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.303
YEAH, I THINK
HE REALLY MISSES HER.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.870
IT'S HARD NOT SEEING HER
ALL THE TIME.

15:58.870 --> 15:59.871
[SIGHS]

15:59.871 --> 16:01.612
IT'S NOT YOU, BAILEY.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.527
HE'S NOT UNHAPPY
BEING WITH YOU.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.225
OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT.

16:05.225 --> 16:09.185
I MEAN, MAYBE
HIS TEACHER'S RIGHT.

16:09.185 --> 16:11.883
SHE THINKS OWEN'S BASICALLY
BEEN THROUGH A DIVORCE.

16:15.061 --> 16:18.455
WELL, THERE IS
A SOLUTION.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.936
IT'S KIND OF NUTS.
NO ONE'S GONNA
WANT TO DO IT.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.460
WHAT?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.464
YOU'RE NOT THINKING...

16:27.464 --> 16:29.597
WE COULD MOVE BACK IN
WITH CHARLIE.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.425
SARAH, NO WAY.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.122
NO WAY!

16:33.122 --> 16:35.603
I DON'T WANT IT EITHER,
BAILEY, BUT THINK ABOUT IT.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.432
YOU'D STILL HAVE OWEN,
BUT HE'D GET TO LIVE
AT HOME.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.999
ALL OF US WOULD
LIVE TOGETHER IN THE HOUSE?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.783
I DIDN'T SAY
IT WOULD BE IDEAL.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.741
WE HAVE OUR LIVES HERE,
SARAH.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.918
WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD
TO MAKE THIS PLACE
WHAT WE WANT.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.572
I KNOW. FORGET IT.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.400
AND OWEN'S BARELY
LIVED HERE A MONTH.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.185
I MEAN, LET'S GIVE IT
SOME TIME, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.448
JUST...

16:54.448 --> 16:56.189
FORGET I SAID
ANYTHING.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.407
OK?

17:08.462 --> 17:10.855
I GUESS...

17:10.855 --> 17:12.901
GRIFFIN, HE...

17:12.901 --> 17:15.904
HE DOES SO MUCH FOR HER.
YOU KNOW?

17:15.904 --> 17:19.299
AND IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T
EVEN REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.911
I MEAN, SHE APPRECIATES IT.
IT'S JUST...

17:22.911 --> 17:24.913
I KNOW HOW HARD
IT WAS FOR HIM

17:24.913 --> 17:27.220
THE FIRST TIME
WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.526
HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR HIM.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.793
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO?

17:37.273 --> 17:39.449
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH GRIFFIN.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.365
HE CARES ABOUT ME.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.368
I MEAN, HE CAME
HALFWAY ACROSS COUNTRY
JUST TO...

17:45.368 --> 17:46.978
RESCUE ME.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.242
HE ASKED ME
TO BE IN HIS BAND.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.721
CLAUDIA...

17:50.721 --> 17:54.769
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SAY
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.467
I MEAN, BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.729
IT'S JUST...

17:58.729 --> 18:00.122
SWEETIE,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.298
I KNOW ABOUT
LOVING SOMEONE

18:02.298 --> 18:05.258
WHO CAN'T LOVE YOU BACK
THE SAME WAY.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.261
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH THOSE FEELINGS?

18:08.261 --> 18:10.219
'CAUSE I'VE TRIED
PUTTING THEM AWAY.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.613
I REALLY HAVE, ROSS,
AND...

18:12.613 --> 18:14.136
THEY HURT.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.790
YEAH.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.792
YES, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.402
AND YOU CAN'T
HELP THAT.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.752
SO WHAT DO I DO?

18:23.232 --> 18:25.452
YOU AND I ARE LUCKY.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.454
WE HAVE THIS THING
WE DO.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.108
WE HAVE OUR MUSIC.

18:29.108 --> 18:33.721
WE CAN TAKE WHAT HURTS,
AND WE CAN PLAY.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.158
FOR ME,
FOR A BROKEN HEART--

18:36.158 --> 18:37.942
TCHAIKOVSKY.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.558
TONGA? BUT--

18:44.558 --> 18:45.820
THIS IS FOR TONGA?

18:45.820 --> 18:46.821
YEAH.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.518
FOR A SUMMER.

18:48.518 --> 18:51.478
THERE'S A, UH,
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
AT SCHOOL

18:51.478 --> 18:53.697
WHO RUNS THIS
FOREIGN STUDY PROGRAM,

18:53.697 --> 18:55.395
AND, UH, THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR TEACHERS.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.005
BUT...

18:57.005 --> 18:58.659
TONGA?

18:58.659 --> 19:00.835
HOW FAR AWAY IS THAT?

19:00.835 --> 19:02.880
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO TRAVEL,
AND MAYBE TEACH.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.882
WELL, THIS IS BOTH.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.581
I--I--SAID I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IT.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.843
[BOTH LAUGH]

19:08.843 --> 19:10.801
OK. BUT LET'S JUST
LOOK AT THIS THING.

19:10.801 --> 19:13.021
I MEAN, IT'S 3 MONTHS
IN THIS AMAZING PLACE.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.631
PAID. WITH KIDS.
I MEAN...

19:14.631 --> 19:16.633
YOU LOVE KIDS.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.679
I'M JUST, UM...

19:18.679 --> 19:21.943
I'M SURPRISED
THAT--THAT YOU WOULD
COME UP WITH THIS,

19:21.943 --> 19:24.424
I MEAN, AFTER WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT ME NOT BEING
AROUND ENOUGH.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.339
WELL, BUT...

19:26.339 --> 19:28.906
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

19:30.995 --> 19:32.823
WELL...

19:32.823 --> 19:34.738
WHAT ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT, CHARLIE?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.697
WHAT DO I WANT?

19:36.697 --> 19:37.959
[LAUGHS]

19:37.959 --> 19:39.961
THIS IS FOR YOU,
NOT FOR ME.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.876
I MEAN,
I'M JUST, UH...

19:41.876 --> 19:43.617
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE A FRIEND.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.227
A FRIEND.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.620
OK.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.448
WHAT? ARE--

19:48.448 --> 19:50.537
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU DON'T WANT THIS?

19:50.537 --> 19:51.538
NO.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
NO. THIS IS...

19:53.453 --> 19:55.455
THIS IS THE PERFECT
JOB FOR ME.
I MEAN, IT IS.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.021
GREAT.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.067
YOU CAN, UH,
YOU CAN USE ME
AS A REFERENCE, THEN.

20:01.635 --> 20:04.203
THAT'S REALLY...

20:04.203 --> 20:06.466
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL FRIEND.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.559
I KNOW HOW YOU LOVE
THE FISH,

20:12.559 --> 20:15.736
AND I THINK WE HAVE
A REALLY WONDERFUL
FISH SPECIAL.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.868
ACTUALLY, LET ME CHECK
WITH THE WAITRESS
AND SEE IF WE HAVE IT.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.136
I'LL CHECK THE KITCHEN
AND SEE IF WE HAVE
ANY MORE OF THE HALIBUT.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.442
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.661
BAILEY, YOU OK?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.839
JULIA. HEY.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.667
YOU SEEM A LITTLE--

20:33.667 --> 20:35.756
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.932
Lauren: BAILEY.
TABLE 7 NEEDS THEIR CHECK
A LITTLE EARLY.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.325
THEY'RE TRYING
TO CATCH A MOVIE.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.674
OH, ME, TOO.
I WONDER IF IT'S
THE SAME.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.849
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.459
SHE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.331
YEAH. THIS IS
MY SISTER JULIA.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.724
JULIA, THIS IS LAUREN,
MY...THE NEW MANAGER.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.943
HI.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.118
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.554
NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.643
YOUR PICTURE'S
IN THE OFFICE, THAT'S WHY.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.253
OH, RIGHT.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.345
WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER GO
MANAGE SOMETHING.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.346
NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.695
YOU, TOO.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.392
SHE SEEMS NICE.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.046
UH-HUH. UM, SO...

21:05.046 --> 21:07.048
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE,
JULE?

21:07.048 --> 21:08.484
I'M MEETING GRIFFIN.
IS HE HERE YET?

21:08.484 --> 21:10.051
GRIFFIN? NO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.271
HUH. THAT'S WEIRD.
I'M LATE.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.142
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE AT 8:00.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.144
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU AND GRIFFIN?

21:16.144 --> 21:19.756
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY OTHER THAN,
"WOW, JULE, THAT'S GREAT,"

21:19.756 --> 21:21.105
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

21:21.105 --> 21:24.065
WOW, JULE, THAT'S GREAT.

21:24.065 --> 21:27.198
MOVIE STARTS
IN 15 MINUTES.
I'D BETTER CALL HIM.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.853
Lauren: NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.378
WANT TO TRY
THE STEAK TONIGHT?
IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.989
Julia: GRIFFIN,
ARE YOU THERE?

21:34.989 --> 21:38.688
IT'S ALMOST 8:30.
I'M AT THE RESTAURANT.
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:38.688 --> 21:41.691
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
MEET ME AT 8:00.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.040
ARE YOU OK?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.172
OH...HMM...

21:44.172 --> 21:45.956
MAYBE YOU'RE STUCK
IN TRAFFIC.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.264
ALL RIGHT.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.831
OK.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.973
HEY. COME ON IN.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.366
HERE'S THAT STUFF
THAT YOU WANTED.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.368
HIS, UH, HIS SPIDERMAN
AND THE BOOKS.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.806
IS SARAH STUDYING?

22:09.806 --> 22:11.460
OH, NO, NO.
SHE'S AT THE LIBRARY.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.810
OWEN'S BEEN SLEEPING
KIND OF LIGHT LATELY,
SO...

22:13.810 --> 22:15.595
SORRY TO COME BY SO LATE,
BUT...

22:15.595 --> 22:16.596
NO, IT'S OK.

22:16.596 --> 22:17.597
Owen: CHARLIE.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.772
THAT YOU?

22:18.772 --> 22:20.382
SORRY.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.427
HEY, BUDDY.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.037
HEY. IT'S PAST
YOUR BEDTIME.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.995
COME ON. LET'S GET YOU
TUCKED BACK IN.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.649
BUT I'M NOT SLEEPY NOW.

22:26.649 --> 22:29.435
SURE YOU ARE.
COME ON, YOU JUST NEED
TO GET BACK UNDER.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.437
NO, I'M NOT.
I NEED A STORY.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.569
PLEASE?
JUST A PAGE OR 2.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.831
THAT'S OK.

22:34.831 --> 22:35.919
I GOT IT COVERED.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.007
OK.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.706
CHARLIE HAS TO READ IT, TOO.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.535
OWEN, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

22:42.535 --> 22:45.494
EASY.
JUST SQUEEZE IN AND...

22:45.494 --> 22:46.756
TAKE TURNS.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.895
ALL RIGHT.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.505
SCRUNCH OVER.

22:56.505 --> 22:57.637
I'M SCRUNCHED.

22:59.073 --> 22:59.987
OK.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.382
[SIGHS]

23:03.382 --> 23:05.384
"SO WHEN HE REACHED
THE STREAM,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.168
"HE MET AN OLD MAN
WITH A LONG BEARD,

23:07.168 --> 23:09.475
"WHO SAID TO HIM...

23:09.475 --> 23:11.912
"GIVE ME YOUR WATER
AND I WILL GIVE YOU SHADE.

23:11.912 --> 23:15.611
"THE BOY SAID,
I'M NOT HOT.
I DON'T NEED SHADE.

23:15.611 --> 23:16.960
SO THE BOY
WALKED ON SOME MORE..."

23:26.709 --> 23:28.842
I THINK HE'S FINALLY
DOWN FOR THE COUNT.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.713
SORRY AGAIN
ABOUT WAKING HIM.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.323
FORGET IT.

23:32.323 --> 23:35.936
IF IT WASN'T YOU,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE SIRENS.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.156
HE, UH...
HE LIKED HAVING US
TOGETHER TONIGHT.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.420
YEAH, HE DID.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.510
AND TODAY, TOO.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.336
PLAYING FOOTBALL.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.385
YOU KNOW, UH...

23:52.561 --> 23:54.433
HE WANTS US TOGETHER.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.087
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

23:57.087 --> 23:59.307
THAT THAT'S WHAT
WE SHOULD DO.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.266
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT'S WHAT
HE WOULD LIKE BEST?

24:02.266 --> 24:03.920
AND WOULD BE BEST.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.927
WHERE ARE WE GOING
WITH THIS?

24:12.668 --> 24:15.366
WELL...

24:15.366 --> 24:18.152
IN CASE WE'RE NUTS ENOUGH
TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS...

24:18.152 --> 24:19.806
THINK ABOUT US MOVING
BACK INTO THE HOUSE?

24:19.806 --> 24:22.156
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT...

24:22.156 --> 24:23.157
THERE'S ROOM.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.814
IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S
FIRST CHOICE, I KNOW.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.946
NO...IT'S NOT.

24:29.946 --> 24:34.168
BUT...DON'T RULE IT OUT
BECAUSE OF ME.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.778
OK?

24:45.745 --> 24:47.137
WE NEED TO TALK.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.272
I KNOW.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.274
WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT, GRIFFIN?

24:53.274 --> 24:56.016
I WAITED
AT THE RESTAURANT.
I CALLED YOU.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.018
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.628
WE HAD A DATE.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.804
DID YOU FORGET THAT?

25:01.804 --> 25:03.589
NO, I DIDN'T.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.508
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.726
DO BETTER THAN THAT.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.728
TELL ME YOU GOT STUCK
AT WORK

25:12.728 --> 25:14.295
OR--OR YOU
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.905
TELL ME YOU GOT A FLAT

25:15.905 --> 25:18.560
AND SPENT THE NIGHT
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

25:18.560 --> 25:19.779
WHERE THERE WEREN'T
ANY PHONES.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.650
TELL ME SOMETHING.
MAKE UP A LIE.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.696
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THAT YOU JUST COULDN'T DEAL.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.744
I'M SORRY.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.137
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.358
I WAS AT HOME LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU CALLED.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.143
I JUST...

25:36.143 --> 25:37.797
I DIDN'T PICK UP.

25:38.493 --> 25:39.886
WHY?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.148
BECAUSE...

25:41.148 --> 25:43.106
WHAT IS THERE TO SAY,
YOU KNOW?

25:43.106 --> 25:44.978
ANY WAY THAT
I LOOK AT IT,

25:44.978 --> 25:47.328
I JUST KEEP SEEING
THE SAME THING.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.677
MISTAKE.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.070
WE MADE...

25:50.070 --> 25:51.332
A MISTAKE.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.334
[LAUGHS]

25:53.334 --> 25:54.944
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

25:54.944 --> 25:57.033
WE'VE--WE'VE BEEN
BACK TOGETHER A--A WEEK.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.687
A WEEK, A YEAR,
WHAT...

25:58.687 --> 26:00.863
COME ON, IT'S--
IT'S STILL US, JULE.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.344
NO. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
THAT IT WENT WRONG ONCE

26:03.344 --> 26:04.606
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
IT CAN GO.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.565
WHY NOT?

26:06.565 --> 26:07.914
BECAUSE THERE'S
TWO OF US HERE.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.916
YOU CAN'T DECIDE
FOR BOTH OF US.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.744
I'M NOT.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.572
I'M DECIDING FOR ME.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.532
IT'S OVER, JULE.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.230
IT'S, UH...

26:20.230 --> 26:22.450
I CAN'T BE WITH YOU
ANYMORE.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.713
I MEAN, I JUST--I--
I DON'T WANT TO.

26:26.933 --> 26:27.847
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

26:29.849 --> 26:30.937
I'M SO SORRY.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.156
I'M SORRY.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.641
HEY.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.512
HEY.

26:41.512 --> 26:42.992
DECAF.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.777
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.779
THANK YOU.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.651
I SAW YOU PACING.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.827
YEAH.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.917
I WAS THINKING.

26:54.917 --> 26:57.398
ABOUT WHAT WE
TALKED ABOUT?

26:57.398 --> 26:59.095
YEAH.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.359
AND?

27:06.755 --> 27:08.801
AND...

27:11.368 --> 27:13.066
AND IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
ONE THING.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.854
I'VE PUT SO MUCH
ON THE LINE FOR
THAT KID, YOU KNOW,

27:18.854 --> 27:21.248
BECAUSE I SHOULD.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.380
SO WHY WOULD I
DRAW A LINE HERE?

27:24.947 --> 27:26.209
WHAT SENSE
WOULD THAT MAKE?

27:29.604 --> 27:30.910
NONE AT ALL.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.827
SO...

27:34.827 --> 27:35.871
WE'RE MOVING.

27:38.221 --> 27:39.570
YEAH.

27:39.570 --> 27:42.095
WOW.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.750
BUT LISTEN TO ME.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.229
IF WE HAVE TO--

27:46.229 --> 27:48.623
IF WE HAVE TO
REFINISH THE ATTIC

27:48.623 --> 27:50.190
OR REFINISH THE SHED
OR WHATEVER WE HAVE
TO DO,

27:50.190 --> 27:52.279
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A LIFE THERE.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.411
WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE OURSELVES
SPACE THERE, OK?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.160
CHARLIE,

28:04.160 --> 28:05.901
I JUST GOT
YOUR FRIEND'S
APPLICATION.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.077
SHE IS PERFECT.
ON PAPER, AT LEAST.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.819
WELL, YOU'LL LIKE HER
EVEN BETTER IN PERSON.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.908
SHE PUT YOU DOWN
AS A REFERENCE,

28:12.908 --> 28:14.954
SO JUST LET ME CHECK
A FEW THINGS.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.434
A B.A. IN CHILD PSYCH,
SINGLE, NO KIDS,

28:17.434 --> 28:19.393
THAT'S PERFECT.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.787
THE LAST THING
WE WANT IS OUR STAFF
GETTING HOMESICK.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.093
YEAH, THERE'S
NO PROBLEM THERE.
I THINK SHE'S, UM...

28:24.093 --> 28:25.704
REALLY READY
FOR A SUMMER AWAY.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.749
SUMMER?

28:27.749 --> 28:30.447
WELL, THAT'LL
GET HER STARTED.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.101
STARTED?

28:32.101 --> 28:33.712
YES.
THE FIRST 3 MONTHS
ARE JUST A TRYOUT.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.366
TEACHERS WE LIKE
STAY ON FOR
ANOTHER 20 MONTHS.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.194
THAT'S THE PROGRAM.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.936
WAIT. YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SHE'D BE GONE FOR...

28:40.936 --> 28:42.590
FOR WHAT, 2 YEARS?

28:42.590 --> 28:44.418
YEAH.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

28:45.898 --> 28:47.987
UH...

28:47.987 --> 28:49.771
WHAT?

28:49.771 --> 28:52.731
UH, IT'S JUST THAT
SHE SAID THAT SHE, UM...

28:52.731 --> 28:55.385
THAT SHE WANTED
TO FINISH SCHOOL.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.300
WELL, HER RESUME
SAYS SHE'S ALREADY
FINISHED HER DEGREE.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.826
YEAH. UNDERGRAD.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.828
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HER GRADUATE DEGREE
WON'T BE DONE

29:02.828 --> 29:04.133
UNTIL SHE WRAPS UP
HER THESIS.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.005
HUH...

29:06.005 --> 29:07.876
WELL, SHE'S BEEN OUT
OF SCHOOL 2 YEARS,

29:07.876 --> 29:09.748
AND SHE STILL HASN'T
FINISHED HER THESIS?

29:09.748 --> 29:13.534
I'M SURE SHE WILL,
AS SOON AS, UH, YOU KNOW...

29:13.534 --> 29:15.188
WHAT, CHARLIE? WHAT?

29:15.188 --> 29:17.320
AS SOON AS SHE...

29:17.320 --> 29:18.626
SHE SORTS OUT HER DIVORCE.

29:21.890 --> 29:22.630
DIVORCE.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.676
I SEE.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.775
BAILEY,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.211
WHAT?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.516
OH, JOY SAW YOU
HEADED BACK HERE.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.910
I GOT THE QUARTERLY
PAYROLL TAXES DONE.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.651
THEY'RE DUE TODAY,
BUT I CAN'T
MESSENGER THEM

29:43.651 --> 29:45.131
WITHOUT
YOUR SIGNATURE.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.915
OK. COME IN.
COME ON IN.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.749
I'M SORRY. IT JUST...

29:54.749 --> 29:56.707
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.493
ARE YOU OK?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.629
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE...

30:05.629 --> 30:08.241
YOU JUST CAN'T
GET A GRIP ON THINGS?

30:08.241 --> 30:09.851
UH-HUH.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.113
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY
STARTING TO SEEM LIKE

30:11.113 --> 30:13.246
EVERY SENTENCE
THAT I HEAR

30:13.246 --> 30:15.378
STARTS WITH...

30:15.378 --> 30:16.423
"YOU SHOULD,"

30:16.423 --> 30:17.772
OR, "YOU BETTER,"

30:17.772 --> 30:19.339
OR, "YOU HAVE TO,"

30:19.339 --> 30:21.297
AND...I...

30:21.297 --> 30:23.430
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
FOR ME TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT IT

30:23.430 --> 30:26.259
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE,
I'VE ASKED FOR.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.174
BUT...

30:28.174 --> 30:30.959
BUT IF I COULD
JUST FIND 5 SECONDS

30:30.959 --> 30:33.396
WHERE NOBODY NEEDED
ANYTHING FROM ME...

30:35.268 --> 30:37.052
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS
LATER?

30:37.052 --> 30:38.749
WE HAVE
TILL MIDNIGHT.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.663
WAIT, LAUREN,
WAIT, WAIT.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.453
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.498
YOU KNOW THAT?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.196
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON

30:50.196 --> 30:52.851
WHO JUST MAKES IT EASIER.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.939
UH-HUH.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.334
NO...NOTHING.

30:58.334 --> 30:59.770
NOTHING.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.555
I'M SORRY.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.690
YEAH. NOTHING.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.216
SO I'M NOT MISTAKEN?

31:10.216 --> 31:12.522
THAT WAS
ANOTHER NOTHING,

31:12.522 --> 31:13.872
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.268
GOD, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH ME?

31:24.491 --> 31:26.319
I BETTER GET BACK.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.973
WHY DON'T YOU
SIGN THESE,

31:27.973 --> 31:29.278
GET THEM TO ME
WHEN THEY'RE DONE.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.627
OK?

31:34.327 --> 31:35.502
[DOOR CLOSES]

31:36.807 --> 31:39.114
CHARLIE?

31:39.114 --> 31:40.942
OH.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.901
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME,
CHARLIE.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.946
EXPLAIN WHY YOU--
YOU--YOU PUSH.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.166
I--I DIDN'T
EVEN ASK, OK?

31:47.166 --> 31:49.037
I MEAN, YOU
PRACTICALLY INSIST

31:49.037 --> 31:50.473
THAT I APPLY
FOR THIS JOB

31:50.473 --> 31:52.475
AND THEN YOU SHOOT
THE WHOLE THING DOWN!

31:52.475 --> 31:54.216
KIRSTEN, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.088
I MEAN, WHY
DID YOU OFFER TO BE
MY REFERENCE

31:56.088 --> 31:58.873
IN THE FIRST PLACE
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
WERE GOING TO SAY?

31:58.873 --> 32:01.745
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE
MY DEGREE YET? I'M
SOME FLAKY DIVORCEE?

32:01.745 --> 32:03.617
IT WAS UNFAIR.
I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.

32:03.617 --> 32:06.315
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU, CHARLIE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:06.315 --> 32:08.143
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

32:08.143 --> 32:10.537
I HEARD ABOUT
THE PROGRAM AND HOW LONG
YOU WERE GOING TO BE GONE.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.539
BUT, UH...YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO SAID

32:12.539 --> 32:13.670
THAT I SHOULD GO
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.542
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, YEAH.

32:15.542 --> 32:18.327
WHAT, SO 3 MONTHS
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY,
BUT 2 YEARS, NO?

32:18.327 --> 32:20.808
IT WAS SELFISH, OK?
I SAID I WAS SORRY!

32:20.808 --> 32:22.810
BUT WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN, "SELFISH"?
YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.072
OF COURSE I DO!

32:24.072 --> 32:25.682
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
YOU JUST SAY IT?

32:25.682 --> 32:27.293
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
SAY IT IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT?

32:27.293 --> 32:29.077
I WANT YOU TO STAY!
OK? I WANT YOU TO STAY.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.383
OK!

32:39.914 --> 32:40.871
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.398
LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT THIS.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.314
NO. WHY?
FORGET IT? WHY?

32:48.314 --> 32:49.968
BECAUSE, KIRSTEN...

32:51.970 --> 32:53.710
THIS IS JUST GETTING
WAY TOO WEIRD.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.104
I MEAN...
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.063
YOU'RE...YOU'RE...

32:58.063 --> 32:59.238
A REALLY,
REALLY GOOD FRIEND,

32:59.238 --> 33:01.588
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO LOSE THAT.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.416
HOW WOULD YOU LOSE THAT?

33:03.416 --> 33:04.634
JUST...

33:06.680 --> 33:09.509
IF I STARTED LOOKING
FOR THINGS, FOR...

33:09.509 --> 33:11.380
FOR STUFF
THAT ISN'T THERE.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.253
REALLY? LIKE WHAT?

33:15.428 --> 33:17.386
LIKE...

33:17.386 --> 33:18.735
I DON'T KNOW.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.565
STUFF, YOU KNOW,

33:22.565 --> 33:25.090
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.
STUFF THAT WE...

33:25.090 --> 33:26.569
THAT WE MOVED ON FROM.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.136
CHARLIE--

33:28.136 --> 33:29.137
KIRSTEN...

33:32.097 --> 33:33.750
PLEASE CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.361
PLEASE. JUST...

33:38.538 --> 33:40.670
YOU MEAN
STUFF LIKE THIS?

33:53.553 --> 33:55.207
IS THAT
WHAT YOU MEAN?

33:58.253 --> 33:59.124
YEAH.

34:11.701 --> 34:14.095
BECAUSE WHAT I WANT--
I'M FEELING WHAT I WANT

34:14.095 --> 34:15.575
IS I WANT TO LOSE CONTROL.

34:15.575 --> 34:18.230
I WANT TO GIVE IN
TO THE--THE CRAVING,

34:18.230 --> 34:21.102
THE--THE URGE, THE ITCH.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.800
BECAUSE I KNOW
IT'S BAD FOR ME,
BUT, MAN, I...

34:23.800 --> 34:25.063
I'LL FEEL GOOD
FOR A WHILE.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.371
I'LL BE FREE...

34:29.371 --> 34:31.460
FOR ONCE.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.592
FOR A WHILE.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.512
AND...THE SCARY THING IS,
IS THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

34:39.512 --> 34:42.428
THAT...THAT ONCE I HAD
ENOUGH CHIPS,

34:42.428 --> 34:44.778
THAT...

34:44.778 --> 34:45.953
THAT I WOULD LOSE THAT ITCH.

34:47.911 --> 34:51.176
BUT...I GUESS
THAT NEVER GOES AWAY.

34:53.700 --> 34:57.312
I GUESS THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO CRAVE.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.140
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A DRINK.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.452
THIS WAS NO SURPRISE,
YOU KNOW.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.151
EVERYONE WARNED ME.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.244
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
CHARLIE DID.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.246
YOU DID.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.030
EVEN GRIFFIN,

35:20.030 --> 35:21.336
THE WAY
HE WAS ACTING.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.688
BUT I WOULDN'T
LISTEN.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.086
ISN'T IT BETTER
THIS WAY, MAYBE?

35:32.086 --> 35:34.523
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF
WAITING MONTHS AND MONTHS

35:34.523 --> 35:35.785
JUST TO FIND THIS OUT.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.616
I DON'T KNOW.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.009
JULIA...

35:43.750 --> 35:45.230
EVEN WHEN
I WAS ALONE...

35:47.406 --> 35:50.322
OR EVEN
WITH SOMEONE ELSE...

35:50.322 --> 35:53.063
HE WAS ALWAYS THERE.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.892
YOU KNOW?

35:55.892 --> 35:57.155
JUST ALWAYS THERE,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.200
LIKE THE AIR
OR SOMETHING.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.378
AND NOW THAT I KNOW
THAT HE'S REALLY
GONE...

36:03.378 --> 36:04.466
IT'S LIKE...

36:06.207 --> 36:08.383
IT SOUNDS SO DUMB,

36:08.383 --> 36:11.299
BUT...

36:11.299 --> 36:13.258
IT'S ACTUALLY
HARDER TO BREATHE.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.538
HOW DID WE...

36:32.538 --> 36:35.584
HOW DID WE MISS THIS?

36:35.584 --> 36:36.716
HOW DID WE GO SO LONG

36:36.716 --> 36:39.327
WITHOUT KNOWING THIS?

36:39.327 --> 36:41.373
I DON'T KNOW.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.243
I MEAN...

36:44.550 --> 36:47.205
THERE WE BOTH WERE,
LIKE...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.337
LA-DI-DA-DI-DA,
LIVING OUR LIVES...

36:51.165 --> 36:53.080
AND HERE WAS THIS...

36:53.080 --> 36:55.082
SECRET WAITING,

36:55.082 --> 36:57.215
THIS...

36:57.215 --> 36:58.868
WHOLE OTHER FUTURE
FOR US TO--

36:58.868 --> 37:00.130
KIRSTEN, STOP.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.219
RIGHT THERE.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.265
I'M SORRY.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.875
WHAT?

37:05.875 --> 37:08.138
WHEN YOU TALK
LIKE THAT, I...

37:09.531 --> 37:12.752
IT SCARES ME.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.755
ABOUT THE FUTURE,
RIGHT? 'CAUSE...

37:15.755 --> 37:16.756
WHO KNOWS?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.236
NO. THAT...

37:18.236 --> 37:20.281
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN
AT ALL. I KNOW.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.891
I JUST...

37:24.242 --> 37:25.895
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
GOING WRONG.

37:28.158 --> 37:31.074
CHARLIE, RELAX.
NOTHING CAN--

37:31.074 --> 37:33.076
KIRSTEN,
I BLEW IT ONCE BEFORE.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.252
OK, BUT--

37:34.252 --> 37:36.732
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT NOW, FOR ME,

37:36.732 --> 37:39.300
CAN WE JUST...

37:39.300 --> 37:41.955
NOT SAY ANYTHING
AND JUST TAKE IT
REALLY, REALLY SLOW

37:41.955 --> 37:43.130
AND EASY?

37:44.479 --> 37:46.089
OK.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.615
NOT A WORD.

38:04.978 --> 38:08.373
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN
ONE THING TO ME?

38:08.373 --> 38:11.854
IF YOU LOVE HER
AND SHE LOVES YOU,
THEN WHAT?

38:11.854 --> 38:13.552
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

38:13.552 --> 38:15.510
CLAUD, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:15.510 --> 38:18.252
JULIA'S WRECKED
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
OF WHAT YOU DID,

38:18.252 --> 38:19.862
AND I WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO KNOW WHY,
GRIFFIN.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.168
WHY DID YOU DO THIS
WHEN...

38:21.168 --> 38:23.301
YOU LOVE HER?
I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.432
AH, SO WHAT?

38:24.432 --> 38:26.434
SO WHAT?

38:26.434 --> 38:28.654
YOU THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
JUST HAPPENS EVERY DAY?

38:28.654 --> 38:30.525
NO, I DON'T.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.179
WELL, OK, THEN.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.660
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE
BELONG TOGETHER.

38:36.575 --> 38:39.491
RIGHT. I JUST REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU,
GRIFFIN.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.972
YOU KNOW,

38:42.972 --> 38:44.931
EVER SINCE
I FIRST MET HER,

38:44.931 --> 38:49.065
I ALWAYS THOUGHT,
"MAN, I HOPE I
DON'T MESS THIS UP."

38:49.065 --> 38:51.633
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I DO, I...

38:51.633 --> 38:54.114
I MESS STUFF UP.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.855
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I NEVER THOUGHT?

38:55.855 --> 38:57.639
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT,

38:57.639 --> 38:59.685
"I HOPE THIS
DOESN'T MESS ME UP."

38:59.685 --> 39:01.643
IT'S JUST...

39:01.643 --> 39:03.689
YOU KNOW,
THESE LAST COUPLE
OF MONTHS, I'VE--

39:03.689 --> 39:05.908
I'VE BEEN
ON MY OWN, AND I'M
STARTING TO FEEL...

39:05.908 --> 39:07.388
OK,

39:07.388 --> 39:10.652
LIKE...WHATEVER I DO
IS FINE.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.438
LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP LOOKING BEHIND ME,
WONDERING...

39:13.438 --> 39:15.831
WHOSE LIFE AM I
HOLDING UP, OR...

39:15.831 --> 39:17.355
WHOSE DREAM
AM I WRECKING?

39:19.835 --> 39:21.620
THAT'S JUST
THE THING, CLAUD.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.665
I THINK
I'D RATHER JUST...

39:23.665 --> 39:24.927
LIVE MY LIFE.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.366
AND BE OK.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.590
HEY. GOOD MORNING.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.331
HEY. GOOD MORNING.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.985
YOU'RE NOT WASTING
ANY TIME THERE, HUH?

39:38.985 --> 39:40.943
WELL, THIS IS JUST
THE PRELIMINARY STUFF.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.336
THE MOVERS COME TOMORROW.

39:42.336 --> 39:45.252
UM, WHERE DO YOU WANT US
TO STORE THIS STUFF?

39:45.252 --> 39:48.037
HOW ABOUT THE SHED?
YOU GUYS WILL SLEEP
IN THE ATTIC, RIGHT?

39:49.343 --> 39:50.736
HI!

39:50.736 --> 39:52.868
HI. KIRSTEN,
WHAT BRINGS YOU
HERE SO EARLY?

39:52.868 --> 39:55.305
OH. UH...

39:55.305 --> 39:57.003
UM, I CRASHED
ON THE COUCH.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.702
THE COUCH?
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

40:00.702 --> 40:04.314
UH...THEN I, UM,
I MOVED INTO THE BED
IN DIANA'S ROOM,

40:04.314 --> 40:05.403
'CAUSE, WELL,

40:05.403 --> 40:06.969
MY KEYS, I, UM,

40:06.969 --> 40:08.754
I LOST THEM LAST NIGHT

40:08.754 --> 40:10.973
AND I COULDN'T GET
INTO MY HOUSE, SO...

40:10.973 --> 40:14.237
OH! UH,
WHICH REMINDS ME, UM...

40:14.237 --> 40:16.501
THE LOCKSMITH. I SHOULD GET
THE LOCKSMITH, RIGHT?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.328
RIGHT. I'LL, UM,
I'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

40:18.328 --> 40:19.547
OK, GREAT.

40:19.547 --> 40:20.809
BYE.

40:20.809 --> 40:21.680
BYE.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.207
HOW IS SHE GOING
TO START HER CAR

40:27.207 --> 40:28.208
WITHOUT HER KEYS?

40:34.693 --> 40:36.346
I'LL GET THE REST
OF THE STUFF.

40:36.346 --> 40:37.260
OK.

40:41.134 --> 40:44.006
AND...

40:44.006 --> 40:45.747
THEN I FIGURE MAYBE
WE COULD GO UP
AND, UH...

40:45.747 --> 40:47.053
SCOPE OUT THE ATTIC.

40:47.053 --> 40:48.881
UNPACK A LITTLE,

40:48.881 --> 40:52.058
TRY ON EACH OTHER'S
CLOTHES...

40:52.058 --> 40:53.755
MAYBE TRY
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE
TO PUT THE COUCH

40:53.755 --> 40:55.191
AND THE--THE
DINING ROOM TABLE.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.024
THAT'S A JOKE,
THE LAST PART.

41:02.024 --> 41:04.940
'CAUSE WE
DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR
A DINING ROOM TABLE.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.985
YEAH, I GET IT.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.379
OK, SARAH, LOOK,

41:09.379 --> 41:10.903
I KNOW...

41:10.903 --> 41:12.600
THAT IT'S--
IT'S A BUMMER

41:12.600 --> 41:15.255
THAT WE HAD TO...
TO LEAVE THE LOFT,

41:15.255 --> 41:18.214
BUT WE HAD GOOD
REASONS TO DO IT,
YOU KNOW THAT.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.868
YOU'RE THE PERSON
WHO HELPED ME
FIGURE THAT OUT.

41:19.868 --> 41:21.000
YEAH.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.915
AND I TOLD YOU
AT THE TIME

41:22.915 --> 41:24.830
THAT IT WASN'T SOMETHING
I WANTED A WHOLE LOT.

41:24.830 --> 41:27.136
BUT THIS IS
MY LIFE NOW.

41:27.136 --> 41:28.616
SARAH,
I HAVE OWEN NOW,

41:28.616 --> 41:30.575
AND THAT MEANS...

41:30.575 --> 41:32.359
MAKING SOME SACRIFICES.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.708
I KNOW THAT, BAILEY.

41:33.708 --> 41:34.622
THEN...

41:36.494 --> 41:38.974
I DON'T KNOW. DO...

41:38.974 --> 41:40.193
WE HAVE TO BE
SO TRAGIC ABOUT IT?

41:41.716 --> 41:43.065
NO.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.372
BAILEY, WE DON'T
HAVE TO BE TRAGIC.

41:45.372 --> 41:47.548
BUT I DON'T FEEL
LIKE BEING A CHEERLEADER
EITHER, OK?

42:10.832 --> 42:12.921
[PLAYING TCHAIKOVSKY]

42:24.672 --> 42:25.978
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

42:52.874 --> 42:55.268
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

42:55.268 --> 42:57.313
I WAS JUST IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I...

42:57.313 --> 42:58.967
SAW THIS INCREDIBLE
PIE IN THE WINDOW.

43:11.153 --> 43:12.111
HEY.

43:13.808 --> 43:15.984
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

43:17.682 --> 43:19.335
I WAS JUST...

43:19.335 --> 43:21.033
FINISHING UP
SOME WORK. WHY?

43:21.033 --> 43:22.512
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST SO LATE.

43:22.512 --> 43:24.384
I WOULDN'T BE HERE MYSELF IF
I HADN'T SPACED MY WALLET.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.432
HEY.

43:29.432 --> 43:30.477
OH.

43:30.477 --> 43:32.174
YOU FOUND IT.
THANK YOU.

43:38.311 --> 43:39.486
ARE YOU OK?

44:05.468 --> 44:06.948
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

44:09.081 --> 44:10.909
I KNOW.
