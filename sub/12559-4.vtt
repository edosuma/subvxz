IT'S A GIFT.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.314
A SMALL REMEMBRANCE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.142
WHAT IS IT?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.068
IT'S A STOPWATCH--AN
OLD FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.485
WHAT DO YOU
DO WITH IT?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.733
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T
KEEP TIME.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.030
IT'S J UST
A STOPWATCH.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.528
THAT IS A FACT.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.859
BUT IT IS YOURS.
YOU MAY HAVE IT.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.695
WHAT'LL I DO WITH
IT? STOPWATCH.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.998
VVELL, SOMEDAY YOU

OR LAUNCH AN ASTRONAUT.

08:25.130 --> 08:29.624
WELL, GOODBYE,

08:48.445 --> 08:50.436
I WOULDN'T LISTEN
TO MY MOTHER.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.191
SHE WANTED ME
TO BE A DOCTOR.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.989
NO, I HAD TO
BE A WISEGUY.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.157
HAD TO RUN A BEER

YOU EMPTIED MY PLACE

09:04.961 --> 09:07.077

SIGN OUT THERE.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.958
DO ME A FAVOR--

09:09.049 --> 09:15.466
VVHENEVER YOU GET THE THIRST,
GO TO SOME OTHER BAR.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.671
I DON'T FEEL MUCH
LIKE GOING HOME.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.133
I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE
ON THE <i>LA</i> TE <i>SHOW.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:23.093
I'VE EVEN SEEN THE MOVIE
ON THE <i>LA</i> TE, <i>LA</i> TE <i>SHOW.</i>

09:23.188 --> 09:25.896
SOMETIMES I EVEN WISH

DO YOU EVER
GET THAT FEELING--?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.310

09:46.961 --> 09:48.292
FIRST, YOU BORE
PEOPLE TO DEATH

09:48.379 --> 09:50.120
AND THEN YOU
MAKE ME NERVOUS.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.081
I MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.635
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.550
YOU'RE THE ONE GUY

09:55.637 --> 09:57.799
<i>THEY NEVER REPEALED PROHIBITION.</i>

10:56.239 --> 11:00.858
NO, THAT CAN'T BE.
[chuckles]

11:00.952 --> 11:03.569
I HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.201
I NEED SOME SLEEP.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.782
IT CAN'T BE.

WHY DON'T YOU
JUMP OFF A BRIDGE?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.728
HONEY DOLL,

14:43.591 --> 14:44.956
I'VE GOT THE GOODS.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.587
<i>YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS NOW.</i>

CALL THE POLICE.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.865
IS THAT SO,
HONEY BABY?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.496
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN THE POLICE.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.497
YOU'LL NEED THE ARMY
AND THE NAVY.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.965
HOW ABOUT
THAT CRUMB?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.584
HE DIDN'T EVEN
LET ME SHOW HIM.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.089
SO WHAT AM

16:22.690 --> 16:24.931
IT'S GOOD FOR A LAUGH
BUT THERE MUST BE

16:25.026 --> 16:27.609
SOMETHING ELSE I CAN
DO WITH THIS THING.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.776
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.997
(woman)
...THE POLICE.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.625
UH... NEVER
MIND, OPERATOR.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.002
HE'S GONE.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.055
SO YOU TELL OUR
ADVERTISING AGENTS...

17:12.698 --> 17:14.608
HEY, JOE. PALUCCI,

WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOUTH?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.960
HA, HA.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.633
LISTEN, LAST NIGHT, I WAS
AT THE POLO GROUNDS.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.175
AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

17:35.263 --> 17:36.719
OF RON HUNT'S SLIDE
INTO SECOND BASE,

17:36.806 --> 17:38.547
I STOPPED THE GAME.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.847
[all moaning]

17:39.934 --> 17:41.550
YEAH, I STOPPED
THE GAME.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.263
I LEFT MY SEAT, I RAN
DOVVN ON THE FIELD,

17:43.354 --> 17:44.640
I GRABBED SECOND BASE,
AND I MOVED IT 1O FEET.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.186
<i>(Joe)
COME ON.</i>

17:46.274 --> 17:47.764
THEN I WENT BACK UP
INTO THE STANDS,

17:47.858 --> 17:49.690
SAT DOVVN AND STARTED
THE GAME AGAIN.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.643
AND HUNT, INSTEAD OF BEING
OUT BY 1O FEET, VVAS SAFE,

17:51.737 --> 17:53.444
AND THE METS WENT ON
TO WIN THE GAME

17:53.531 --> 17:55.397
BECAUSE SNIDER
DOUBLED HIM HOME.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.027
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
THING I CAN STOP.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.574
I CAN STOP
ANYTHING-- WATCH.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.906
DIDN'T YOU SEE
WHAT I DID?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.483
OUT OF THE WAY.
I WANT TO GET HOME,

18:40.578 --> 18:41.739
GET SOME PEACE

18:41.829 --> 18:43.160

18:56.344 --> 18:57.880
YOU DRIVE MORE GUYS
OUT OF SALOONS

18:57.970 --> 18:59.301

18:59.388 --> 19:01.504
I GET IT.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.557
OF COURSE YOU GUYS DIDN'T
SEE- YOU VVERE FROZEN.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.805
I'M THE ONLY

I'M THE ONLY ONE.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.353
<i>HUH. HOW ABOUT THAT.</i>

19:09.440 --> 19:12.683
THE GREATEST CONVERSATION PIECE
IN THE VVORLD- THE GREATEST--

19:12.777 --> 19:13.892
AND WHAT DOES IT DO?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.442
IT STOPS CONVERSATION.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.395
I'M GONNA CLOSE UP
IN A FEW MINUTES,

19:17.490 --> 19:20.278
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A TOTAL

BEER.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.030

19:23.120 --> 19:25.828
DON'T YOU EVER ORDER
ANYTHING EXPENSIVE?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.201
BEER.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.998
AND DRINK IT FAST,
WILL YOU?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.702
'CAUSE THE COMBINATION
OF YOU, THE HOT WEATHER,

19:31.796 --> 19:33.252
AND MY
BUSINESS RECESSION

19:33.339 --> 19:36.752
IS MORE THAN I CAN
TAKE IN ONE DAY.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.344
GIVE IT TIME.
GIVE IT TIME.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.343
GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK
SOMETIME, VVILL YOU, MCNULTY?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.514
LEAVE A TIP.

19:56.654 --> 20:01.148
HEY, PALUCCI,
COME HERE.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.698
<i>LOOK AT ME.</i>

20:02.785 --> 20:04.696
WHAT ARE YOU, SOME
KIND OF A SADIST?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.778
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.374
A JERK, A NUT.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.868
YOU WANNA STOP THERE
OR TRY FOR MORON?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.620
WHY DO I WANT
THIS THING? WHY?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.497
BECAUSE I WANT
A LITTLE NOTICE.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.964
I'M NOT ASHAMED
TO ADMIT THAT.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.913
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.089
WHEN JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER
STEPS OUT OF A CAR,

20:19.176 --> 20:21.087
WHY DO PEOPLE WANT
TO SHAKE HIS HAND?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.259
I'LL BITE.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.178
