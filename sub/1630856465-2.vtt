00:05.047 --> 00:07.174
[Frederick] Who is that girl?

00:07.258 --> 00:08.843
[Duchess of Rochester]
Her name is Clara Dunn.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.136
The Duchess tells me you've
recently arrived in London.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.971
[Clara] Yes.

00:12.054 --> 00:15.141
Can I take it from all this that
you're serious about the girl?

00:15.224 --> 00:16.350
Miss Dunn,
would you do me the honor

00:16.434 --> 00:18.310
of becoming Lady Trenchard?

00:18.394 --> 00:20.146
I don't want to frighten you.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.522
[Clara] I'm not frightened.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.190
[Frederick] I haven't always
found life easy.

00:23.274 --> 00:26.444
I've sometimes felt
myself betrayed.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.988
You've worked for the family
for a long time, Mr. Enright?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.906
Twenty-six years, Your Ladyship.

00:30.990 --> 00:31.991
Enright.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.242
Is my brother at home?

00:33.325 --> 00:35.119
I read the announcement
of his marriage.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.163
I'd like him to know
he's in my thoughts.

on the way.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.334
Thank you for everything
that you did, Miss...

00:42.418 --> 00:44.378
-Dunn.
-James Trenchard.

00:44.462 --> 00:46.297
Did you say Trenchard?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.841
-My sister is Clara Dunn.
-[Dawes] Get him in!

00:48.924 --> 00:51.552
I'm sure you appreciate why
the Duke is determined

00:51.635 --> 00:55.347
that Peter's illness should not
become common knowledge.

00:55.431 --> 00:59.226
No one will ever hear a single
word about your past from me.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.020
I want something
on a larger scale.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.189
[Duke of Rochester]
The Marquise d'Etagnac.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.065
She's one of
the richest women in Europe.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.817
We must talk further.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.486
[Frederick] That woman is
extremely important to me,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.279
and you humiliated me
in front of her.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.490
-I didn't.
-You ask me to trust you.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.991
And this is what you do?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.410
-Clara, please...

[Frederick] No, no, no!

for a moment, Your Lordship.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.416
[Davison] I believe I know
what you're thinking, sir,

01:22.499 --> 01:23.959

03:19.450 --> 03:21.368

-Same as usual please, Mawd.
-Yes, Mr. Enright, sir.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.724
She won't need much.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.226
She's not feeling
too well this morning.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.518
What's wrong with her?

04:28.602 --> 04:31.397
-She's not...
-No.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.732
-Is he back?
-Not yet.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.360
He should have said whether
he'd need any breakfast.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.445
What's taken him out
at this hour?

04:38.529 --> 04:40.406

In my experience,

05:14.523 --> 05:18.068
I believe he's out.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.446
Must have let himself out
in the night.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.489
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.577
[Duchess of Rochester]
He was asking if I could

05:26.660 --> 05:30.581
recommend a doctor
who would be kind and discreet.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.750
-Was he?
-Hmm.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.377
I recommended Dr. Ellerby.

05:35.461 --> 05:38.172
I thought they seemed
a little off when they left.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.133
And they left so abruptly.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.718
Ah, well,
Frederick is Frederick.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.262
If he wishes for us to know,
he'll tell us.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.599
Mm. I hope they managed
to find Ellerby.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.309
He's extremely reassuring.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.227

05:56.398 --> 06:00.569
Percy, the last time
he was here,

06:00.652 --> 06:03.155
Ellerby suggested
that Peter might benefit

06:03.238 --> 06:05.491
from seeing
the other children occasionally.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.160
I do wonder
if he might not be right.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.705
And Amelia is always
talking about her brother.

06:11.789 --> 06:15.167
He also spoke about some
new treatments which--

06:15.250 --> 06:18.462
I see, Dizzy is at it again.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.428

06:26.512 --> 06:30.724

the right moment.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.851
I know you do.

06:32.935 --> 06:37.189
But there never seems to be one.
Because there isn't one.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.359
Is there a right moment
to talk about the whole future

06:40.441 --> 06:42.569
of one's family line
collapsing in shame?

06:45.489 --> 06:49.743
Sorry, Mary,
but let's not, okay?

06:49.827 --> 06:52.496

07:04.258 --> 07:06.718
Fine morning, Your Lordship.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.263
-This foundry?
-Abercrombie's?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.515
Does it produce only iron?

07:11.598 --> 07:15.394
I believe so. I know
it's been here a long while.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.603
Is it possible
for an iron foundry

07:16.687 --> 07:19.398
to expand
in order to produce steel?

07:19.481 --> 07:20.899
The steelworks project
which failed

07:20.983 --> 07:22.568
has nothing to do
with this place.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.572
I'm aware of that. I'm asking
if it's possible in theory.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.574
If it is, it would be a more
economic proposition,

07:28.657 --> 07:31.493
would it not, than building
an entirely new works?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.412
I expect they
often sit side by side.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.581
The steel needs the iron,
after all.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.585
It would certainly be
a bigger project

07:39.667 --> 07:40.961
than we've looked at before.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.838
I reckon there'd be
no end of problems, though.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.214
Would they want to expand?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.799
Would we be able
to undercut Sheffield...

07:45.883 --> 07:49.803
Factors. Not problems.
To be considered and dealt with.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.430
Look into it.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.600
Begin by finding out
whether it's even possible.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.476
And I want to know
why the last project failed.

something you can help me with.

45:06.913 --> 45:10.542
Does His Lordship's brother
ever call here

45:10.625 --> 45:12.919
and try to see him, perhaps?

45:13.002 --> 45:15.463
Why do you ask, Your Ladyship?

45:15.547 --> 45:16.798
Does he?

45:19.134 --> 45:22.011
I do have some understanding
of the situation.

45:22.095 --> 45:25.140
Was there a time
when they were children when...

45:25.223 --> 45:28.184
I think there must have
been a time when...

45:28.268 --> 45:31.020
there was affection
between them?

45:31.104 --> 45:32.772
Surely?

45:35.775 --> 45:40.613
Whatever you think
you understand, Your Ladyship,

45:40.697 --> 45:44.033
I fear I need to warn you
that you don't.

45:44.117 --> 45:47.203
Some things are better
left well alone.

45:47.287 --> 45:49.706
And some are better mended.

45:49.789 --> 45:52.125
Not this.

45:52.208 --> 45:56.129
I'm sure you wouldn't wish to
bring trouble upon His Lordship.

45:56.212 --> 45:58.214
[Clara] Of course I wouldn't.

45:58.298 --> 46:00.842
His happiness
is my only concern.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.969
Then we are in agreement.

46:03.052 --> 46:07.140
Yes. Thank you, Enright.

46:07.223 --> 46:09.684
Your Ladyship.

46:15.899 --> 46:17.609
[sighs]

46:55.855 --> 46:58.650
[whispering] James...

47:04.113 --> 47:06.991
