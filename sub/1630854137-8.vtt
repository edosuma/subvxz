<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:09.792

especially heinous.</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624

00:15.624 --> 00:17.408
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.408 --> 00:19.062
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:25.895 --> 00:27.679
Are you my appendix?

00:27.679 --> 00:28.898
Excuse me?

00:28.898 --> 00:30.421
Because I want
to take you out.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.858
Oh, that's--

00:32.858 --> 00:34.860
That's not nice,
that's my drink.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.036
Not anymore.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.473
- Okay.
- Don't you know?

00:38.473 --> 00:41.476
Possession is 9/10 of the law.

00:41.476 --> 00:42.825
Where'd you get
your law degree,

00:42.825 --> 00:45.219
College of Staten Island?

00:45.219 --> 00:46.916
These lips could
give a guy like you

00:46.916 --> 00:49.527
a hell of a 21st birthday.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.051
Who told you
it was my birthday?

00:55.359 --> 00:56.447
What did I tell you?

00:56.447 --> 00:57.274
Hey.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.971
Hey, hey, hey.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.495
Oh, come on,
what's the matter?

01:00.495 --> 01:02.714
What, did she spill
your gin fizz?

01:02.714 --> 01:05.369
It was a tequila Negroni,
you philistines.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.936
- A what?
- It ain't an insult

01:06.936 --> 01:08.372
if we never heard
the word before.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.374
- Whose idea was that?
- Relax, kid.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.289
Mandy's a catch.
A good, Irish Catholic girl.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.725
All right, that's it.

01:13.725 --> 01:14.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean that's it?

01:14.944 --> 01:16.032
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.381
I'm going back to the city.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.382
What do mean you're
going back to the city?

01:18.382 --> 01:19.992
We're playing a game.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.256
I told you I wanted
to keep my birthday low key.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.997
Oh, come on, turning 21
is not a low-key birthday.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.390
These guys watched you grow up.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.175
Come on, they just bought
you a drink, that's all.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.526
Aidan!

01:32.962 --> 01:34.137
Aidan!

01:35.791 --> 01:37.314
Son! Hey!

01:37.314 --> 01:38.750
These guys didn't
mean anything by that.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.143
They just wanted to
celebrate with you.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.188
By getting me laid.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.450
What's wrong with that?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
If I have to
explain it to you,

01:44.147 --> 01:45.453
then you haven't
been listening.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.107
I gotta go.
- No, no, no, wait.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.282
Just give me one second, okay?

01:48.282 --> 01:49.587
I have your suit
for Aunt Pammie's wedding

01:49.587 --> 01:51.111
in the trunk of my car.
Give me one--

01:51.111 --> 01:52.416
My car is
literally right here,

01:52.416 --> 01:54.418
and I didn't pick out
that suit; you did.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.724
Don't start with that.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.726
You want me to wear it
so bad, you drop it off.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.293
You want me to drive
into Manhattan

01:59.293 --> 02:01.904
to drop off your suit?

02:01.904 --> 02:04.254
Aidan!

02:04.254 --> 02:05.647
Oh, come on.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.390
- Hey.
- Oh.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.392
There you are. Sit down.

02:11.392 --> 02:15.918
And, uh, ask me why I'm popping
a bottle of champagne

02:15.918 --> 02:17.398
in the middle of the day.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.834
You won a big case?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.052
- No.
- No.

02:20.052 --> 02:23.360
We are celebrating.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.710
Okay, I figured that out.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.191
Okay, listen, stop being
a detective for five seconds.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.631
You blew those kids
at Fordham away,

02:33.631 --> 02:35.981
and my old college roommate
was impressed.

02:35.981 --> 02:39.811
And he called me today
to put out some feelers.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.248
For what?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.293
The way he puts it,

02:43.293 --> 02:46.122
they're gonna approach you
with a job offer--

02:46.122 --> 02:47.689
a teaching position.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.648
I'm not a teacher.

02:50.648 --> 02:54.086
No, but you are an expert
in forensic psychology.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.959
After you got shot,
you've been all but hinting

02:56.959 --> 02:58.221
that you might need a change.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.788
I thought this
might be perfect.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.659
Carisi, stop being
a lawyer for five seconds.

03:01.659 --> 03:06.186
I didn't mean leaving SVU.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.232
You can say no if you want.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.453
Just don't say no right now.

03:12.453 --> 03:14.498
Right now,
enjoy your champagne,

03:14.498 --> 03:16.674
and then after that,
sleep on it.

03:19.764 --> 03:20.939
To the future.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.292
Hmm.

03:26.902 --> 03:27.903
Hmm.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.174
Aidan?

03:38.174 --> 03:39.871
Yo?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.917
Aidan!

03:41.917 --> 03:43.571
Aidan, come on,
it's getting late.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.269
We got to be suited up
in the church by 9:00 a.m.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.706
Aidan!

03:48.706 --> 03:50.360
Aidan, if you don't show up,
your aunt

03:50.360 --> 03:51.709
is gonna absolutely lose it.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.102
I can hear your cell in there.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.059
I know you're in there,
come on!

03:55.757 --> 03:57.062
Aidan!

04:00.892 --> 04:02.764
Aidan?

04:58.776 --> 05:01.126
So the victim is the kid
of one of our own?

05:01.126 --> 05:03.825
Detective Mark McDaniels,
Grand Larceny division.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.697
The same McDaniels who
collared the postal inspector

05:06.697 --> 05:08.525
a few years back?
- Special Frauds.

05:08.525 --> 05:11.180
That phony check scam case, right?

05:11.180 --> 05:13.791
Mack's a good man.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.620
What can you tell us
about his son?

05:16.620 --> 05:19.971
The kid just turned 21,
lived alone, went to FIT.

05:19.971 --> 05:23.627
Worked for some high-end
clothing brand in Soho.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.542
And his father
is the one who found him?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.196
He called it in.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.415
I called you guys.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.330
What's the sexual component?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.723
I found bite marks
on his genitals.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.303
I couldn't get him
out of the house.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.652
We'll talk to him.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.003
Detective McDaniels?

05:52.003 --> 05:53.570
I'm Captain Benson.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.093
This is Detective Rollins.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.446
Can you tell us what happened?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.577
Yeah.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.405
Uh...

06:02.405 --> 06:05.974
We were celebrating my son's,
uh, you know, 21st birthday,

06:05.974 --> 06:08.411
and, uh, you know,

06:08.411 --> 06:09.499
he used to be
such a good bowler

06:09.499 --> 06:11.153
when he was a kid, so we--

06:14.852 --> 06:20.031
And I was just
trying to drop off his suit.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.947
You know, uh,

06:22.947 --> 06:26.081
you know that expression
one day at a time?

06:26.081 --> 06:28.170
I think today

06:28.170 --> 06:31.260
it's one minute at a time.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.656
He had--
he had bite marks on him.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.313
On his back,
on his upper thigh,

06:41.313 --> 06:44.621
and, uh,

06:44.621 --> 06:47.929
all over his,
uh, his groin area.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.584
Yeah, Detective Fernandez
brought us up to speed.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.586
I mean, as far as I know,
my kid was a virgin.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.979
What kind of--
what kind of monster does this?

06:54.979 --> 06:56.416
That's what
we're gonna find out.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.592
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

06:58.592 --> 07:01.377
The door, was it broken
like that when you got here?

07:01.377 --> 07:03.248
No, I did that.

07:03.248 --> 07:06.251
I didn't know it was
a crime scene, but, you know,

07:06.251 --> 07:08.993
when I looked in and I saw my--
my son dead on the--

07:08.993 --> 07:12.693
on the floor, you know,
I kind of lost it, okay?

07:12.693 --> 07:15.260
Is there somebody
that we can call for you?

07:15.260 --> 07:16.261
Your wife?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.568
My ex, Laura.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.048
Yeah, I should call her.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.051
Yeah, if I was his mother,
that's what I would want,

07:23.051 --> 07:25.270
and I'd want to hear it
from you.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.794
Yeah.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.012
Oh, God.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.459
We came as soon
as I got your text.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.590
This guy's in bad shape.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.462
Look, father to father--

07:42.462 --> 07:44.681
Okay, I'll keep
an eye on him.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.596
This kid, it's awful.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.163
He crossed paths
with a monster

07:48.163 --> 07:49.860
at some point last night.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.167
Look, go outside and check if
there's any security cameras.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.691
Check his phone, his social,
and tell me what you find.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.617
Did the perp place
the towel like that?

08:07.617 --> 08:08.966
I asked Mack about it.

08:08.966 --> 08:12.143
He said he did it
to preserve the kid's dignity.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.494
Okay, well,
that's gonna mess up the case,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.496
but I certainly get it.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.672
Half the closet's empty.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.717
Drawers too.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.979
Kid was an art school student.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.807
Probably on a
shoestring budget.

08:23.807 --> 08:26.810
Probably didn't have much
to begin with.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.725
That may be something.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.118
May be nothing.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.860
Thanks, Fernandez.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.951
Can you imagine if it was
Jessie or Billie or Noah?

08:36.951 --> 08:39.083
We're used to seeing
this stuff all the time.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.607
I can't.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.051
Thanks for coming in
on your day off.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.575
Well, what can you tell us
about Aidan McDaniels?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.577
Well, in addition
to bite marks,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.927
he's got quite a few injuries.

08:56.927 --> 09:00.496
Cause of death, head trauma,
internal bleeding.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.845
So he was beaten?

09:01.845 --> 09:03.673
More like tortured.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.588
Whoever did this started
with the biting,

09:05.588 --> 09:07.198
then switched to some kind
of object.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.026
Do you have any idea
what the object was?

09:09.026 --> 09:11.638
Blunt force,
four inch diameter

09:11.638 --> 09:14.292
with a significant taper.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.686
Off-hand, I'd say
it was a wine bottle.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.776
Likely the same one
he was sodomized with.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.343
So it was a rage attack?

09:21.343 --> 09:23.606
He's got quite a few
internal ruptures.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.086
Ooh.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.305
Do you know if this happened
antemortem or post?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.090
Haven't had enough time
with the body yet.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.221
Why?

09:30.221 --> 09:31.571
Does that impact
your investigation?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
No, but it'll matter
to the father.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.270
He's a cop,
he's gonna ask questions.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.577
I know I would.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.927
Were you able to recover
any DNA?

09:39.927 --> 09:43.887
Checked the vic's mouth,
under the nails,

09:43.887 --> 09:45.846
got a whole lot of nothing.

09:45.846 --> 09:49.066
Really? That's odd.
He didn't fight back at all?

09:49.066 --> 09:52.461
Whether he did or he didn't,
it's tough to say,

09:52.461 --> 09:54.376
and even tougher
to prove at trial.

09:54.376 --> 09:57.640
His nails were trimmed
right down to the beds.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.903
I also found residue
of sodium stearate

09:59.903 --> 10:03.341
on his hands, face,
neck, upper body.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.213
Sodium stearate?

10:05.213 --> 10:08.259
A common surfactant used
in household detergents.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.740
And based on the new
and improved lemony scent,

10:10.740 --> 10:12.655
I'd say it was dish soap.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.702
Okay, so whoever this was
knew how to get rid of the DNA.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.529
Sometimes the absence
of something

10:17.529 --> 10:19.662
has a presence all its own.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.625
That level of rage,
we're looking at some type

10:25.625 --> 10:26.887
of serial sex predator.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.192
But rage is--is primal.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.672
Rage is messy.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.631
It doesn't stop
to trim someone's nails.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.980
But people can
learn to control

10:32.980 --> 10:35.330
their aggressive impulses, professor.

10:37.419 --> 10:41.075
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.946
What now?

10:42.946 --> 10:44.339
You get anything, Muncy?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.689
Yeah, I went
through Aidan's texts.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.169
He made plans
to meet up with a friend

10:48.169 --> 10:51.172
after the bar, Brian Donnelly,
at the old neighborhood.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.216
Where's that?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.304
Howard Beach.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.697
Where John Gotti
used to live.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.308
That neighborhood is racist,
sexist, and phobic

10:57.308 --> 10:59.920
of just about everything.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.922
Good place to meet a monster.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.671
That's Aidan, good kid,
a little sensitive.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.715
So he got murdered?

11:12.715 --> 11:14.151
Jeez.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.023
Catch the guy?
- We're working on it.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.938
We heard Aidan
was here last night.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.809
Well, you heard wrong.
Not Aidan.

11:19.809 --> 11:23.117
His boy Brian was here
with some chick.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.248
You sure?

11:24.248 --> 11:25.685
I don't mean to talk
out of school.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.686
The guy's married.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.817
No Aidan?

11:27.817 --> 11:29.210
I was here all night.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.690
If Aidan was here,
I would've high-fived the guy.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.343
It was his birthday.

11:32.343 --> 11:35.520
I've been slinging that kid
free pints since he turned 16.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.046
Did you just confess
to serving a minor alcohol?

11:39.046 --> 11:41.526
All it would take is a
phone call to shut you down.

11:41.526 --> 11:44.312
Unless you show us
the security footage?

11:49.621 --> 11:51.711
We scrubbed through
all the security footage.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.757
We saw Aidan's friend Brian
out on some kind of a date.

11:54.757 --> 11:57.412
And it didn't go too well
because after about 20 minutes,

11:57.412 --> 11:58.935
the date storms off.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.458
And no Aidan?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.460
No, and I went through
all 12 hours the bar was open--

12:02.460 --> 12:04.332
just a bunch of meatheads
getting drunk.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.986
Hold on, go back,
I want to see something.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.815
Freeze it.

12:17.649 --> 12:18.999
Does Aidan have a sister?

12:20.827 --> 12:23.873
Nope, he's an only child.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.702
Brian's date is Aidan.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.978
That's you with Aidan, right?

12:41.978 --> 12:43.675
Yep.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.329
He asked me to meet him
at the bar.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.766
You mean she?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
Why'd he want to meet you?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.422
Said he wanted to talk.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.598
- About what?
- What do you think?

12:55.818 --> 12:57.820
That.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.519
Aidan was my best friend
since second grade.

13:03.870 --> 13:04.827
He's like my brother.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.570
Then she shows up.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.571
So you didn't know
about this?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.356
That his name was now Aida?

13:16.273 --> 13:19.015
Howard Beach is a
tough neighborhood.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.495
I'm lucky he passed.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.888
The bartender didn't
even know who he was.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.151
So if she didn't pass,
the meatheads there

13:24.151 --> 13:25.239
would have beat your ass?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.370
Both of our asses.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.632
So that's what
the fight was about?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.764
Yeah, I was pissed.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.810
I freaked out, yelled at him.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.596
I overreacted, yelled at him
to stay the hell away from me.

13:34.596 --> 13:38.034
Don't you think I want
to take that back now?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.644
Okay.

13:39.644 --> 13:42.647
So did Aida tell you where
she was going after she left?

13:42.647 --> 13:47.043
She just asked if I would
accept her for who she was.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.392
And what'd you say?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.005
No.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.876
What'd you do
when you left the bar?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.791
I went home.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.315
My wife was in the middle
of breastfeeding our baby.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.404
If you need an alibi,
you can ask her.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.928
Your wife?

14:01.928 --> 14:04.800
It's not gonna hold
a lot of water in court.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.542
We're gonna need to take
your dental impressions.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.587
Dental impressions?

14:09.587 --> 14:12.895
Yeah, whoever killed
your friend left bite marks.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.252
I had to do it
all over again,

14:22.252 --> 14:24.776
I would have bought him a beer
and said I loved him.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.046
Brian's dental impressions
weren't a match.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.786
And his cell phone
put him at home

14:34.786 --> 14:36.310
at the time of Aida's murder.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.007
So our killer
is still out there.

14:38.007 --> 14:41.228
All right, so any idea where
Aida went after Howard Beach?

14:41.228 --> 14:43.186
Her cell phone pinged a tower
in the West Village

14:43.186 --> 14:44.622
at 1:00 a.m.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.928
A lot of bars in that area.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.104
Where she would
feel accepted.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.758
We'll start a canvass
in the village.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.760
And we need to speak
with Mack and his wife

14:51.760 --> 14:55.024
to find out
if they had any idea

14:55.024 --> 14:57.113
about their child's
private life.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.426
Laura just flew in.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.341
She hasn't been back
since we split.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.777
She's a mother, I get it.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.257
I told her it was
an active crime scene,

15:10.257 --> 15:13.129
but she wouldn't listen.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.828
Anyway, you guys aren't here
to be marriage counselors.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.831
We have some new evidence.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.399
Is there a place
that we could talk?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
This was from the night
of the murder

15:25.968 --> 15:27.578
at a bar in Howard Beach.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.840
Yeah, what is it?
This is nothing.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.625
He's in art school, come on.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.019
Well, we talked
to Aidan's friend,

15:33.019 --> 15:37.719
and he told us that Aidan
was trying to live as Aida.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.547
Who? What friend?

15:39.547 --> 15:40.983
- Brian Donnelly.
- Donnelly.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.116
The Donnelly family
are a bunch of criminals.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.160
He lied.
- Mark--

15:44.160 --> 15:45.205
- No.
- He's not lying.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.336
What are you talking about?

15:46.336 --> 15:47.555
Remember when Aida
came to visit me

15:47.555 --> 15:48.904
in Sedona?
- Yes.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.601
She was dressed like this
the whole time.

15:50.601 --> 15:51.951
We even did a rebirth ceremony.
- Okay, I can't even listen--

15:51.951 --> 15:53.561
- Her name is Aida now.
- I can't listen to this.

15:53.561 --> 15:54.736
And this is something
that you thought

15:54.736 --> 15:56.346
you should keep from me?

15:56.346 --> 15:59.306
Aida wanted to tell you in
her own way when she was ready.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.177
I told her to live her truth.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.701
Okay, I think
the most important thing

16:03.701 --> 16:06.052
is that you both love
the same child, am I right?

16:06.052 --> 16:10.186
So the more information
that we have about Aidan,

16:10.186 --> 16:11.579
the easier it will be
to find his killer.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.234
Her name is Aida.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.496
She was my best friend.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.367
We told each other everything.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.803
We spoke on the phone
every night.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.940
What do you want to know?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.986
We need a list of
your child's friends,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.858
and can you think of anybody
that would be angry enough

16:29.858 --> 16:32.121
to do something like this?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.514
I don't understand.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.081
Aida was an artist.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.343
She kept to herself.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.997
She wasn't an angry person.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.911
Unfortunately,
the killer was.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.783
Which leads us
to the next thing

16:41.783 --> 16:44.438
that we wanted to
talk to you about.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.267
The pieces don't fit.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.877
'Cause on the one hand,
Aidan's crime scene

16:48.877 --> 16:51.097
exhibits all the hallmarks
of a spree killer--

16:51.097 --> 16:52.489
rage, sloppiness.

16:52.489 --> 16:56.145
And on the other hand,
there was a meticulousness

16:56.145 --> 16:57.712
and a great deal of care.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.236
Are you saying that
two different people

17:00.236 --> 17:01.455
attacked my daughter?

17:01.455 --> 17:02.978
And you think
we're one of them?

17:02.978 --> 17:05.459
All we're saying is that
these two things

17:05.459 --> 17:07.374
don't normally go together.

17:07.374 --> 17:10.290
All right, whoever did this
went to great lengths

17:10.290 --> 17:14.511
to cover all of their tracks
despite their apparent anger.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.731
There were no clothes
in the closet.

17:16.731 --> 17:20.082
No makeup.
No traces of a secret life.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.171
Most importantly,
there was no DNA.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.651
Okay, then you go
back to the house.

17:23.651 --> 17:24.956
We will.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.480
I'm sorry, I thought
you were a captain.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.003
- Mark!
- No!

17:28.003 --> 17:29.657
Laura, listen, they should
be solving Aidan's murder,

17:29.657 --> 17:31.224
not accusing us.

17:31.224 --> 17:34.488
Look, I know that you've
both been through a lot,

17:34.488 --> 17:36.142
and I feel for you,
I really do,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.535
but there's one thing that
you should know about me.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.972
If I thought that
you killed Aidan,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.452
you'd already be in cuffs.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.897
That went well.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.508
Yeah.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.163
I think I understand why Laura
moved all the way to Sedona.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.034
If it's any consolation,
I saw what she did

17:59.034 --> 18:00.862
with Mack there,
that verbal judo.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.516
Rollins, I've been
giving guys like that

18:02.516 --> 18:04.083
the smackdown my entire career.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.520
No, I'm talking about
you mirroring his language.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.217
Well, he wasn't
gonna talk to us

18:08.217 --> 18:09.653
if I used the wrong pronoun.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.091
Wrong to him.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.744
You saw the look
on his face when I talked

18:13.744 --> 18:15.964
about the closets
being emptied out?

18:18.053 --> 18:19.010
I did.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.798
Look, from his point of view,
I mean,

18:23.798 --> 18:26.105
it's like the guy
lost his son twice.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.542
I've seen
disassociation before.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.674
You have too.

18:30.674 --> 18:34.069
I mean, like you said,
the pieces don't fit.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.245
You think
he's hiding something?

18:36.245 --> 18:37.203
I don't know.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.250
There's been another assault.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.166
Chelsea, same MO--
sodomy, attempted murder.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.386
Let me guess, the vic's
covered in bite marks?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.127
Yeah.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.002
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

18:54.002 --> 18:56.744
- Cora.
- What happened, Cora?

18:56.744 --> 19:00.226
He tried to kill me,
the man from the bar.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.750
Munce.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.491
Uni says she maced the guy

19:04.491 --> 19:07.233
and he fell off
that fire escape.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.104
That means he couldn't
have gotten far.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.116
Why don't you start wherever
you feel comfortable?

19:21.116 --> 19:22.857
And you don't have
to go in order.

19:22.857 --> 19:28.123
I was leaving the Cubbyhole
with some friends.

19:28.123 --> 19:32.823
They got into a cab,
and this guy started

19:32.823 --> 19:34.085
chatting me up outside.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.391
Did he give you his name?

19:35.391 --> 19:36.610
Lukas.

19:36.610 --> 19:41.310
He was tall, cute,
light brown hair,

19:41.310 --> 19:44.139
and dimples and an accent.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.619
Okay, do you know
what kind of accent?

19:45.619 --> 19:48.274
French or Dutch maybe.

19:48.274 --> 19:52.060
He said he was in town
for a month as project manager

19:52.060 --> 19:54.062
for some architecture firm.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.542
Did he mention the name
of the firm?

19:55.542 --> 19:56.891
No, he didn't.

19:56.891 --> 20:01.722
So, um, can I ask you
a sensitive question?

20:01.722 --> 20:06.074
I'm in a hospital bed
covered in bite marks.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.771
I think we're past that.

20:07.771 --> 20:08.772
Okay.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.252
Did he know that
you were trans?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.036
I told him.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.691
He was intrigued.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.867
And what happened
when you got home?

20:19.348 --> 20:20.480
The second
we got into the door,

20:20.480 --> 20:23.874
it was like a switch flipped.

20:23.874 --> 20:27.008
He went full-on beast mode.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.270
How?

20:28.270 --> 20:29.880
He slammed me
against the wall

20:29.880 --> 20:35.886
and tore my clothes off
and started biting me.

20:35.886 --> 20:40.978
Then he grabbed
a wine bottle, and...

20:40.978 --> 20:43.459
started raping me with it.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.287
I pretended to go along with it

20:45.287 --> 20:49.683
so I could grab my mace.

20:49.683 --> 20:52.468
I blinded the bastard,
and he took off out the window.

20:52.468 --> 20:57.125
I heard him fall, but when
I looked down, he was gone.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.609
Oh, oh, what's the matter?

21:02.609 --> 21:05.264
What's the--what is it?
- Ma'am, are you okay?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.744
Oh, that poor man
must have fallen.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.659
Oh, I tell my friend Rita
all the time

21:09.659 --> 21:11.270
she should watch out
for these things.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.793
These bodegas are
gonna kill somebody.

21:12.793 --> 21:13.968
You should give
the owner a ticket.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.230
Hey, freeze!

21:15.230 --> 21:16.318
What if my dog
fell down there?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.015
Ma'am, shut up!
Fin, I got him.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.495
Corner of 10th and 21st.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.803
Basement of the Circle Mart.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.588
<i>Stay put, Muncy.</i>

21:25.588 --> 21:28.287
NYPD!

21:28.287 --> 21:29.810
Hands where I can see 'em!

21:43.214 --> 21:44.738
- Get up!
- Ah! Ah!

21:44.738 --> 21:47.001
Get up!

21:47.001 --> 21:48.481
You're under arrest! Hey!

21:48.481 --> 21:50.831
You're under arrest!
- Muncy? Muncy?

21:50.831 --> 21:53.486
I got him. I got him.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.487
What the hell
happened to him?

21:54.487 --> 21:56.663
I think he's
got a broken rib.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.491
Don't look at me,
I didn't do it.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.535
He fell off the fire escape

21:59.535 --> 22:01.450
and then went down there
to hide.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.629
Do you think it's the
same guy who attacked Aida?

22:06.629 --> 22:07.891
We'll see.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.502
I mean, hopefully,
we'll get some usable DNA

22:09.502 --> 22:11.112
from Cora's rape kit.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.548
Fin?

22:12.548 --> 22:14.637
Muncy hauled this guy
out of a bodega cellar.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.030
<i>Are we sure that it's him?</i>

22:16.030 --> 22:17.510
Well, he's pretty banged up.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.815
Either he fell off
a fire escape

22:18.815 --> 22:21.252
or Muncy's a lot stronger
than she looks.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.253
<i>You have
a black light on you?</i>

22:22.253 --> 22:23.733
Yeah, why?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.518
Because our vic just said
that she maced him,

22:25.518 --> 22:27.084
and as far as I know,

22:27.084 --> 22:29.304
all pepper spray
has UV dye in it.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.305
<i>Okay.</i>

22:41.272 --> 22:42.709
It wasn't me.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.754
Yeah, well, your eyes
tell a different story.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.976
Lukas Peeters,
he's a Belgian national.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.717
He's been in New York
for two weeks.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.414
He doesn't have a record
in the U.S.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.894
We're checking with Interpol.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.243
And the victim, Cora,
made a positive ID?

22:55.243 --> 22:57.550
In a lineup.
And the forensics were a match.

22:57.550 --> 23:00.466
His prints and her DNA
were on the wine bottle

23:00.466 --> 23:01.815
that was used in the assault.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.164
This guy make any admission
of guilt

23:03.164 --> 23:04.426
before he lawyered up?

23:04.426 --> 23:05.862
Oh, he's claiming
that it was consensual.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.342
Nice try.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.213
I'll arraign him,
I'll get an indictment.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.432
The vic's good to testify?
- She is.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.520
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.956
Detective McDaniels is here.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.959
It's okay. Send him in.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.181
I heard you have
a suspect in custody?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.443
There he is. He killed my son.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.837
We don't know that.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.273
What are you
charging him with?

23:25.273 --> 23:27.014
As of now,
aggravated sexual abuse

23:27.014 --> 23:28.015
and attempted murder one,

23:28.015 --> 23:29.799
but on the case
from last night.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.322
No, I heard about
the bite marks

23:31.322 --> 23:32.759
on the second vic, the sexual assault.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.630
Did you match those
to the bite marks on Aidan?

23:34.630 --> 23:36.589
Actually,
they were inconclusive.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.068
Did you even ask him
about Aidan?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.027
We did, and he denies
ever having met her.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.290
Okay, so canvass all the
bars, pull the street cams.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.509
Put them together, do your job.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.684
Detective McDaniels--

23:44.684 --> 23:45.902
Even if they
were seen together,

23:45.902 --> 23:47.600
there is no evidence
putting him

23:47.600 --> 23:49.515
at your child's crime scene.
There's no DNA.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.039
We told you the whole place
was wiped.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.259
Oh, my God.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.136
Detective McDaniels,
is there something

24:02.136 --> 24:04.094
that you want to tell us?

24:04.094 --> 24:06.793
Because your son was
dressed as a woman

24:06.793 --> 24:10.623
the night of his murder,
and we cannot find the clothes.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.451
There's no makeup.
- You know what?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.714
I'm not the one that you should
be interrogating, Captain.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.585
Not when my son's killer
is sitting in the other room.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.762
Did you--did you swab this guy?

24:19.762 --> 24:22.504
He has to have scratches, cuts.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.463
My son didn't take this
lying down.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.681
Because you taught him
to be tough?

24:25.681 --> 24:27.291
Yeah, he would have
fought like a man!

24:27.291 --> 24:30.947
The ME didn't find anything
under his fingernails.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.080
In fact, there were hardly
any fingernails at all.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.169
There is definitely
something else out there,

24:35.169 --> 24:37.519
something that you have missed.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.000
There's no way that this guy
did what he did to my son

24:40.000 --> 24:41.567
without leaving more
of a trace.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.873
You have to go back, right?

24:43.873 --> 24:45.614
Start your investigation
from square one,

24:45.614 --> 24:47.311
or I promise you you're
gonna be standing in front

24:47.311 --> 24:49.836
of a firing squad at CompStat
wondering why you didn't

24:49.836 --> 24:51.925
do this right
in the first place.

25:06.635 --> 25:09.420
The victim, Cora Jones,
was injured and traumatized.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.032
She told
responding officers that

25:12.032 --> 25:14.425
Lukas Peeters
had tried to kill her.

25:14.425 --> 25:17.559
And you found evidence
that supports her statement?

25:17.559 --> 25:20.127
She was covered
in bite marks, bruises,

25:20.127 --> 25:23.522
subdural hematoma from
being clubbed with a bottle.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.699
We later learned that
she was forcibly penetrated

25:26.699 --> 25:28.439
with that same implement.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.224
How did you identify
a suspect?

25:30.224 --> 25:31.791
Well,
Cora had maced her attacker,

25:31.791 --> 25:35.272
and he tried to flee
but fell down a fire escape.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.492
Detectives tracked him down
to a local bodega

25:37.492 --> 25:39.538
where he was hiding
in a basement.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.757
And Ms. Jones
identified herself to you

25:41.757 --> 25:43.454
as a trans woman, correct?

25:43.454 --> 25:44.717
Yes.

25:44.717 --> 25:47.458
And in your experience
as an SVU detective,

25:47.458 --> 25:49.591
do you believe that
she was targeted

25:49.591 --> 25:51.811
because of how she identifies?
- Objection.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.291
My client is not being charged
with a hate crime.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.598
A little latitude,
Your Honor?

25:56.598 --> 25:58.557
I'll allow this line
of questioning,

25:58.557 --> 26:00.254
but move it along.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.865
Witness may answer.

26:02.865 --> 26:06.260
Actual numbers
are underreported.

26:06.260 --> 26:10.699
Transgender people,
they're a targeted community.

26:10.699 --> 26:15.922
They more often experience
rape, sexual assault, murder.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.576
And who usually
commits these crimes?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.273
It's often
an intimate partner,

26:19.273 --> 26:22.450
but it can be a stranger
who initiates sexual contact

26:22.450 --> 26:25.627
and then changes their mind
and reacts violently.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.150
And in your experience,

26:27.150 --> 26:29.718
why would somebody
react this way?

26:29.718 --> 26:33.200
People like to put things
in neat little boxes,

26:33.200 --> 26:37.117
and gender identity just
doesn't work that way.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.337
It is a deeply felt,
individual experience

26:40.337 --> 26:43.602
that doesn't always correspond
to the sex given at birth.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.388
And this seeming contradiction,
it--

26:47.388 --> 26:50.739
well, it can lead to explosive
reactions in some perpetrators.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.481
Was this the case
with Lukas Peeters?

26:53.481 --> 26:56.310
Lukas Peeters purposely
sought out Cora

26:56.310 --> 26:58.965
because she was a trans woman.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.054
And again,
in your experience,

27:01.054 --> 27:02.621
why would he do that?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.797
Well, in my estimation,
the rage exhibited

27:04.797 --> 27:06.799
in this attack is--

27:06.799 --> 27:09.758
it's a peculiar form
of projection of his anger

27:09.758 --> 27:12.369
about his own desires, which--

27:12.369 --> 27:15.155
which were in conflict
with who he believes

27:15.155 --> 27:18.201
he should be
sexually attracted to.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.638
Thank you.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.991
Is there a
simpler explanation

27:24.991 --> 27:27.123
for all this, Detective?

27:27.123 --> 27:29.735
Such as consensual rough sex,
for example?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.606
No, not in my opinion.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.347
The bite marks,
the wine bottle.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.176
The initials
CNC come to mind,

27:36.176 --> 27:37.873
consensual nonconsensual.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.701
You've heard of it?
- Yes.

27:39.701 --> 27:45.576
And you're saying
it's impossible in this case?

27:45.576 --> 27:47.753
You recently gave a lecture
at Fordham University

27:47.753 --> 27:50.494
where you said, and I quote,

27:50.494 --> 27:53.106
"Human sexuality is strange,"

27:53.106 --> 27:55.151
did you not?

27:55.151 --> 27:56.849
Yes, and later in that--

27:56.849 --> 27:58.633
Thank you.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.069
Nothing further.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.422
Lukas Peeters attacked me.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.425
Pinned me against the wall,

28:08.425 --> 28:10.732
ripped my clothes off,

28:10.732 --> 28:13.256
started biting me.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.084
Then he raped me with a bottle.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.216
And what did you do?

28:16.216 --> 28:18.392
I pretended to go along.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.873
Did you mean that
as some form of consent?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.178
Consensual nonconsensual?

28:22.178 --> 28:24.615
Absolutely not.

28:24.615 --> 28:29.708
I did it so I could grab
my mace as a way to survive.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.711
Otherwise, I knew
he would have killed me.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.842
Thank you.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.409
No further questions.

28:37.498 --> 28:43.112
Isn't it true you told
my client you like it rough?

28:43.112 --> 28:45.811
There's rough,
and then there's assault.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.682
Lukas assaulted me.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.553
Did you ever
tell him to stop?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.253
I wanted him to.

28:53.253 --> 28:58.084
Did you say the word stop?

28:58.084 --> 28:59.912
I don't recall.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.696
The night is fuzzy.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.437
He hit me on the head
with a bottle.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.786
How about the word no?

29:08.355 --> 29:10.270
I was in shock.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.793
It happened so fast.

29:11.793 --> 29:15.666
Never said stop or no.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.844
Is it possible my client took
the omission of those words

29:18.844 --> 29:20.280
as tacit consent?

29:20.280 --> 29:21.629
He had me pinned down.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.413
I was trying to defend myself.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.632
Correct me if I'm wrong,

29:24.632 --> 29:27.243
but weren't you
on the wrestling team

29:27.243 --> 29:28.418
in college?

29:31.508 --> 29:34.990
Yes, but that was
in my former life.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.731
Just curious,

29:36.731 --> 29:40.126
did you identify
as a man in college?

29:46.915 --> 29:48.787
Yes.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.615
And why wrestling?

29:51.615 --> 29:56.011
I was jumped
outside of a local bar

29:56.011 --> 29:57.404
in the town I grew up in.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.275
And where was that?

29:59.275 --> 30:00.973
Muscatine, Iowa.

30:00.973 --> 30:04.628
A small factory town.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.196
It must have been hard
growing up there?

30:07.196 --> 30:08.981
Well, it wasn't
the friendliest place.

30:08.981 --> 30:13.333
Still, it's fair to say

30:13.333 --> 30:15.596
you know how
to defend yourself?

30:15.596 --> 30:19.165
It's been a long time,
and I'm no longer that person.

30:19.165 --> 30:22.298
But you remember
the techniques.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.345
How to throw someone,
how to shift your weight,

30:25.345 --> 30:26.912
how to catch them off guard.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.871
My physicality
is completely different now.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.395
Or maybe there's
another answer.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.267
That you enjoyed
being overpowered,

30:34.267 --> 30:36.095
and you didn't want it to stop.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.010
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.374
Cora, you okay?

30:54.374 --> 30:56.376
- I'm sorry.
- No.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.901
No, you have nothing,
nothing to apologize for.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.208
For what it's worth,
that lawyer's strategy,

31:02.208 --> 31:03.426
going after you like that

31:03.426 --> 31:04.906
didn't score any points
with the jury.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.473
What about when Lukas
takes the stand?

31:06.473 --> 31:09.041
You don't have to
watch his testimony.

31:09.041 --> 31:12.261
I thought I was an expert
at seeing people like that,

31:12.261 --> 31:13.872
that it would keep me safe.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.049
You became an expert
in human behavior because--

31:17.049 --> 31:18.398
because you had to.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.487
I hate that I was wrong
about Lukas.

31:20.487 --> 31:23.751
- You couldn't have known.
- Then how will the jury?

31:23.751 --> 31:25.927
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

31:31.454 --> 31:32.978
You're a saint.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.849
I've no idea how you work
these kinds of cases every day.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.938
Well, somebody has to.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.461
This poor kid.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.420
I mean, where the hell
were her parents?

31:40.420 --> 31:41.769
If my Aidan was in
that witness box,

31:41.769 --> 31:43.640
I would have been there
every step of the way.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.599
Cora didn't have that luxury

31:45.599 --> 31:49.429
because her parents
never accepted her.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.083
She left home
when she was a teenager.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.954
I just hate the fact that she
was even attacked like that.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.739
The world is
a messed-up place.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.567
Yeah.

31:57.567 --> 32:01.789
But at least there's people
like you out there.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.399
Like me?

32:03.399 --> 32:07.316
Somebody who makes
a mistake but ultimately

32:07.316 --> 32:09.797
does the right thing.

32:09.797 --> 32:10.972
I'm sorry, are you trying
to say something--

32:10.972 --> 32:11.973
I am.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.630
You know, Mack,
everyone has said to me

32:16.630 --> 32:20.286
that you're a good man...

32:20.286 --> 32:22.375
but we both know what you did.

32:24.464 --> 32:30.035
And quite frankly,
I understand the impulse.

32:35.954 --> 32:42.003
But placing a towel
over your child...

32:44.179 --> 32:47.008
Wasn't the only thing

32:47.008 --> 32:48.618
that you did, was it?

32:50.838 --> 32:51.795
Was it?

32:54.885 --> 32:57.845
I didn't want all the cops,
the techs,

32:57.845 --> 32:59.629
everybody crawling
all over that place

32:59.629 --> 33:03.677
investigating his murder
to see him like that.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.288
Commenting on him,
laughing at my son.

33:06.288 --> 33:10.379
So you took off her nails...

33:10.379 --> 33:13.687
you wiped off her makeup...

33:13.687 --> 33:15.167
and you hid her clothes.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.385
I--

33:18.387 --> 33:19.780
What the hell did I do?

33:21.956 --> 33:22.826
I chose shame.

33:22.826 --> 33:25.786
Over justice for your child.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.356
If I'd just left everything
the way it was,

33:30.356 --> 33:32.967
everything at the crime scene,

33:32.967 --> 33:36.057
maybe Cora wouldn't
have been attacked.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.625
You know, Cora--

33:38.625 --> 33:40.018
Cora needed a father.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.758
She needed somebody
who accepted her,

33:41.758 --> 33:47.547
who was there for her.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.766
You can still be there
for Aida.

33:52.117 --> 33:56.730
That's the name that your
daughter chose for herself.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.648
I guess I wasn't
really listening.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.307
I'm not a good person.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.048
You can be a better one.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.496
So this is what
Aida was wearing

34:23.496 --> 34:25.237
the night of her murder?

34:25.237 --> 34:28.544
Yeah, that's everything,
everything I--

34:28.544 --> 34:29.719
I hid.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.896
The clothes Aida
was attacked in.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.116
We'll comb them for DNA.

34:44.082 --> 34:48.390
Mack, if you're really serious

34:48.390 --> 34:50.392
about Lukas Peeters going away,

34:50.392 --> 34:54.309
then Carisi will
indict him on murder.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.137
That means that you're
gonna have to testify

34:56.137 --> 34:58.052
in front of the grand jury.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.968
Are you okay with that?

35:00.968 --> 35:02.491
I am.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.667
And you understand
that that means

35:04.667 --> 35:06.365
that you need to confess

35:06.365 --> 35:08.018
for tampering
with the crime scene?

35:08.018 --> 35:09.107
I know.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.456
That's a felony.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.762
I know.

35:17.811 --> 35:21.510
Well, then if I were you, I--

35:21.510 --> 35:23.947
I would talk
to my union delegate,

35:23.947 --> 35:26.646
and I would hire--

35:26.646 --> 35:28.735
I'd hire a good lawyer.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.345
Whatever it takes
to make this right.

35:30.345 --> 35:33.435
Even if it means
you'll lose your badge?

35:40.138 --> 35:43.576
It was quiet when I got
to Aida's apartment.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.448
She, uh--she didn't
answer the door.

35:46.448 --> 35:50.322
So I looked in the window,
and that's when I saw the--

35:50.322 --> 35:53.368
saw legs on the floor.

35:53.368 --> 35:58.025
And I immediately
got a bad feeling.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.680
What did you do next?

36:00.680 --> 36:03.291
I kicked in the door
to get to my daughter.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.207
Can you describe
how you found her?

36:12.082 --> 36:15.129
Eyes shut, splayed out.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.787
She had bruises and bite marks.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.182
There was blood everywhere.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.099
I moved her body...

36:30.623 --> 36:34.192
To put her to bed
one last time.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.671
What was she wearing?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.199
Jeans, a blouse,

36:41.199 --> 36:45.072
red, high-heeled shoes.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.814
She had makeup on her face.

36:47.814 --> 36:51.600
She had those fake nails,

36:51.600 --> 36:54.212
which I removed.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.218
I was acting on instinct.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.743
A big part of me knew what
I was doing was wrong, but...

37:05.440 --> 37:09.401
I'm also very aware of what
it's like at a crime scene.

37:09.401 --> 37:14.232
You know, you got photographs
and detailed reports, and--

37:16.973 --> 37:18.627
And what?

37:22.109 --> 37:23.284
And as was stated earlier,

37:23.284 --> 37:26.374
my daughter identified
as a woman.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.248
I didn't accept that.

37:32.162 --> 37:36.471
I wasn't enough of a man
to accept that.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.821
And I'm ashamed of it now,

37:38.821 --> 37:42.260
but I was too embarrassed
to let the cops--

37:42.260 --> 37:45.828
the very men that I work with--

37:45.828 --> 37:47.743
see her like that.

37:47.743 --> 37:51.181
What did you do
with Aida's effects?

37:51.181 --> 37:52.531
I put them
in two garbage bags

37:52.531 --> 37:56.926
and hid them in the boat
in my garage.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.538
Why'd you hold on to them?

37:59.538 --> 38:00.887
Because they were
the last things

38:00.887 --> 38:02.932
I had to remember my child.

38:12.202 --> 38:15.249
The grand jury handed down
an indictment for murder one,

38:15.249 --> 38:17.425
thanks to Detective McDaniels'
testimony

38:17.425 --> 38:20.428
and confirmation of Lukas's
DNA on Aida's clothing.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.212
And when you told Lukas
and his lawyer?

38:22.212 --> 38:23.997
Oh, they folded like origami.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.782
15 years for man one,
10 years on Cora's charges.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.393
And we also heard
from Interpol.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.872
Any DNA hits in Belgium?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.005
Eight other rape victims
in Germany.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.790
He was a project manager
for a building there last year.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.575
And the DA's office
will cooperate

38:36.575 --> 38:38.316
with the German police
on those cases,

38:38.316 --> 38:40.666
but only after Lukas
serves his sentence here.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.372
Muncy, let me
ask you question.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.287
You want a bite
of my Hawaiian pizza?

38:53.287 --> 38:55.637
No, thank you.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.292
It's about that Belgian guy
in the bodega cellar.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.381
Yeah, what about him?

39:00.381 --> 39:01.817
How long did you
actually wait

39:01.817 --> 39:03.297
before you went down
those stairs

39:03.297 --> 39:05.343
after I told you don't go?

39:05.343 --> 39:06.518
Honestly, Sarge,
I was already

39:06.518 --> 39:07.867
halfway down the steps.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.608
What the hell
is wrong with you?

39:09.608 --> 39:11.261
You know you could have
got killed, right?

39:11.261 --> 39:12.698
Yeah, but I wasn't.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.050
But I hear you.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.486
I wasn't thinking.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.532
It's just,
sometimes people piss me off.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.447
Yeah, I get what you mean.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.926
But you do something
like that again,

39:23.926 --> 39:25.232
I'm gonna have to tell Benson.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.367
And one more thing,

39:29.367 --> 39:32.065
I don't know
how you do it in Queens,

39:32.065 --> 39:34.154
but people up in Harlem,

39:34.154 --> 39:36.548
we don't put fruit
on our pizza.

39:47.297 --> 39:51.998
So the loss of a child is not
something you can prepare for.

39:54.522 --> 40:00.441
Aida had dreams and a lot
of plans for the future.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.312
Plans that, um...

40:07.056 --> 40:10.625
She didn't share with me
because she didn't

40:10.625 --> 40:12.018
feel like I would accept her.

40:16.283 --> 40:20.026
And that is my loss because--

40:20.026 --> 40:23.029
Because I never
got to meet her.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.296
But I loved her.

40:32.647 --> 40:36.259
- To Aida.
- To Aida.

40:36.259 --> 40:37.739
all:
To Aida.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.089
Aida.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.395
You think they have a shot?

40:41.395 --> 40:43.353
Now that they both
love the same child?

40:43.353 --> 40:45.965
Yeah, maybe.

40:48.968 --> 40:50.230
To love.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.275
Mm.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.929
Nice work, professor.
