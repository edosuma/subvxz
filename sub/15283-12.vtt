00:18.090 --> 00:20.480
- State street.
- Not again.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.120
Cop was just doin' his job.

00:22.140 --> 00:24.560
He didn't really have to
direct traffic around me.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.910
He saved dozens of lives that day,honey.

00:28.890 --> 00:33.710
All right. Now,seat belt and...

00:33.720 --> 00:34.980
Oh,no talking on the phone.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.360
You need to be totally confident in
the seat so you can be aware of,uh...

00:40.750 --> 00:42.840
What's happening around you.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.950
I have to go.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.000
No,no,no. Come on. It's
sunday. You promised.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.010
Want your mom to take you?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.910
Come on,Andrea.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.120
I'll be home before dinner.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.830
Yeah,right. You said that last time.

01:00.910 --> 01:06.310
I was gonna tell you this later,
but,uh,I really need to see you smile,

01:06.320 --> 01:12.370
So when you've gotten your license,
this little beauty is all yours.

01:18.920 --> 01:19.840
Dad!

01:19.860 --> 01:22.350
How do you like your old man now,huh?

01:23.580 --> 01:26.220
- But you can't let your grades slip.
- No,they won't. They won't.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.040
Uh,hello,lisa.

01:28.050 --> 01:30.140
Lisa,guess who just got a new car.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.550
No way.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.140
And all I have to do is get my license.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.250
- And...
- And keep my grades up.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.740
Uh,Mr. Harris, can you talk to my dad?

01:40.410 --> 01:42.810
- So great.
- I love it. That's awesome.

01:42.820 --> 01:45.220
Did you guys hear there's
another girl missing?

01:45.240 --> 01:46.900
Missy Dewald?

01:46.910 --> 01:48.050
What, do you know her?

01:48.060 --> 01:49.460
She goes to bennett.

01:49.490 --> 01:52.300
High school? Well,all the
other girls were in college.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.920
Maybe it's not the same guy.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.640
But he alternates between
black and white girls.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.280
What,you guys don't read the paper?

01:59.300 --> 02:02.420
If he's going younger, we're in trouble.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.950
William Harris.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.610
What is this about?

02:19.880 --> 02:20.830
Yes?

02:20.840 --> 02:26.010
William Harris,you're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Missy Dewald and the murder of 3 women.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.770
- You have the right to remain silent.
- You have a warrant?

02:28.780 --> 02:31.220
Look in the attic, the
garage,and the storage shed.

02:31.230 --> 02:32.770
She's here somewhere.

02:32.790 --> 02:35.700
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

02:35.730 --> 02:38.110
You have the right to have an attorney
present during the questioning.

02:38.130 --> 02:40.590
If you cannot afford an attorney,one
will be provided for you.

02:40.610 --> 02:43.000
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yes.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.900
- William, what is going on?
- It's a mistake. It's a mistake.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.930
I'll be home soon.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.770
What are you doing?

02:57.790 --> 02:58.870
Got tired of waiting.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.330
What's that supposed to mean?

03:00.340 --> 03:03.400
You can look all you want.
Missy Dewald isn't here.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.870
All week,you been sayin'
he need privacy and time.

03:08.890 --> 03:13.020
You told me he wouldn't keep her on
his property, but I wouldn't listen.

03:13.030 --> 03:15.860
Detective, we have a witness who
can place him at the abduction site.

03:15.880 --> 03:19.450
He has a history of similar offenses
where he did use the same m.o.in Atlanta.

03:19.460 --> 03:24.490
He fits the profile-- a high-functioning successful
family man living and working in the area.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.160
You had probable cause
to make the arrest.

03:26.170 --> 03:28.200
We just don't have enough
to prosecute him yet.

03:28.220 --> 03:29.250
What's our next move?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.420
The key to finding her
could be in his house,

03:31.450 --> 03:33.750
So we're gonna need to dig
through all there is of his life--

03:33.780 --> 03:36.590
Family,work,his friends.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.410
Agent Morgan and I will interrogate him.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.480
All right.

03:41.510 --> 03:44.030
He holds his victims for 2
days before he kills them.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.200
Missy disappeared yesterday.

03:46.230 --> 03:49.770
So as long as he stays in custody, there's
a good chance she could still be alive.

03:49.790 --> 03:52.730
Talk to the detective that
arrested him for the Atlanta rapes.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.900
Find out what went right and what
went wrong with their approach.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.360
Williams is a successful litigator,
so we're gonna need some leverage,

03:59.370 --> 04:00.770
Somethin' to throw him off guard.

04:00.790 --> 04:04.380
A discrepancy in a previous statement,
that's enough to give us the upper hand.

04:04.390 --> 04:05.370
I'll get on that.

04:05.380 --> 04:08.330
Now,we can only hold him for so
long after he goes before the judge.

04:08.340 --> 04:11.750
What are the odds we can get him
to break in the next 12 hours?

04:12.960 --> 04:15.330
That's not gonna be easy.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.450
Did he do it? Did William
Harris rape and kill those girls?

05:21.460 --> 05:22.910
I'm sorry. I can't answer that.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.950
He was the coach of my
daughter's soccer team.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.140
Please. I'm afraid to
let her leave the house.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.760
I know this is frustrating.

05:28.770 --> 05:33.020
As soon as we get any information,
we will release it to the public.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.050
Hold tight,ok?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.440
Excuse me.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.770
William Harris, i'm
special agent derek Morgan.

05:46.790 --> 05:48.980
This is special agent david Rossi.

05:48.990 --> 05:51.860
Before you,uh, answer any questions,

05:51.870 --> 05:55.240
I need to remind you that you're
entitled to have a lawyer present.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.690
I am a lawyer.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.960
She look familiar to you?

06:07.130 --> 06:09.240
How 'bout her?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.630
Her? No?

06:16.550 --> 06:19.120
The three of these girls were
raped,strangled, and dumped.

06:19.130 --> 06:22.740
My god. I have a daughter their age.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.050
Missy Dewald. She
went missing yesterday.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.670
What do you think you have on me?

06:29.380 --> 06:33.090
We have a witness who can place you at
the mall the same time of her abduction.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.180
And,uh,well, rumor has it that you seem
to have a history of this type of behavior.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
How is that?

06:38.210 --> 06:40.090
Tell us about Atlanta.

06:40.110 --> 06:44.440
Atlanta? Those charges were
dropped. It was a mistake.

06:44.450 --> 06:50.800
Because the 2 rape victims wouldn't testify,
and now you cover your tracks by killing them.

06:52.210 --> 06:54.700
I didn't do this.

06:54.710 --> 06:59.550
So,William,you've been
married,what,18 years?

06:59.570 --> 07:03.510
You remember that feeling
you get when you fall in love?

07:03.530 --> 07:09.960
All those firsts-- the kiss, the
smell of her hair-- it's exciting.

07:10.350 --> 07:13.800
You miss that feeling, don't you?

07:14.330 --> 07:20.690
Being married to the same woman, it's
like ordering the same entree for 18 years.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.700
Agent Rossi,every
minute you spend with me

07:24.710 --> 07:27.570
is another minute she's alone with him.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.290
So we've brought in the wrong guy?

07:30.300 --> 07:31.250
Yes.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.010
Just like they did in Atlanta.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.450
Yes.

07:34.470 --> 07:37.360
And by the time you realize
i've been telling the truth...

07:39.030 --> 07:42.620
This poor girl could be dead.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.020
Would you prefer to do this alone?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.860
Uh,this may be too
disturbing for your daughter.

07:54.650 --> 07:57.110
It's ok. We have no secrets.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.700
Can you account for William's
whereabouts for the last 24 hours?

07:59.710 --> 08:01.670
My dad was at home with us.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.930
The whole time?

08:02.960 --> 08:06.790
He may have ran out for about an
hour or so. I really don't rember.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.970
3 girls have been murdered, Mrs. Harris.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.770
Missy Dewald is missing now,
and she's running out of time.

08:11.780 --> 08:13.110
That's not my fault.

08:13.140 --> 08:15.840
How would you feel if
someone was hurting Andrea?

08:16.460 --> 08:18.280
Why did you move to
florida 6 months ago?

08:18.300 --> 08:20.540
My dad got a better
offer with another firm.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.010
It had nothing to do with
the rape charges in Atlanta?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.550
Those charges were dropped.

08:24.580 --> 08:28.010
Do you really think it's a coincidence
your husband's been a suspect twice?

08:28.020 --> 08:32.309
It was a mistake, just like this.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.179
Has William been distant lately?

08:35.200 --> 08:36.980
Spent a lot of time behind closed doors?

08:36.990 --> 08:40.400
He works a lot. Is that a crime?

08:40.409 --> 08:45.920
I think you've known something
is off, and it's made you wonder.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.880
It's something only you would know.

08:48.890 --> 08:52.420
Mrs. Harris,you can
save Missy Dewald's life,

08:52.430 --> 08:54.920
in spite of what's
happening in your family.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.930
That's enough. This interview is over.

09:08.780 --> 09:09.820
You find anything?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.980
Give me a minute. I will find the grime.

09:11.990 --> 09:14.490
All right. You ready to
start searching his computer?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.460
Born ready.

09:18.770 --> 09:20.140
Seem to be in control.

09:20.150 --> 09:22.170
i'm always in control, sweet cheeks.

09:22.190 --> 09:25.050
So far,William Harris appears
to be quite intelligent.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.050
He's covering his tracks pretty well.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.130
Yeah,just because you
delete your history,

09:29.160 --> 09:33.430
It doesn't mean all your dirty cyberlaundry isn't
hanging out there for me to find on your hard drive.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.570
Rookie mistake.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.350
William.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.590
- Keep moving,sir.
- Bailiff...

09:41.600 --> 09:44.370
Mr. Harris can have a few
moments with his family.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.150
- Dad.
- Honey.

09:48.710 --> 09:49.820
How's my girl?

09:49.830 --> 09:51.290
I'll be fine once you're home.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.690
I'm workin' on that. How you doin'?

09:55.030 --> 09:56.930
I know. Believe me,I know.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.280
But,uh, they don't have a case.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.610
Honey,bail was set at $5
million. They must have something.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.920
Well,after Atlanta...

10:03.950 --> 10:07.650
Ok,so what should I do? Should I
pull money from the retirement fund?

10:07.660 --> 10:10.610
- Just use the house.
- The house?

10:10.620 --> 10:12.390
Honey,where are we gonna
go if something happens?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.010
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Mr. Harris.

10:15.020 --> 10:18.000
- I have to go. Look after your mom for me.
- I will.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.730
I need you to be
strong. I love you both.

10:20.740 --> 10:26.550
We love you,too,honey. Thank you.

10:28.870 --> 10:32.300
Did you see how Sharon reacted
when he said to put up the house?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.460
She's starting to doubt him.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.170
Garcia's been digging
through William's computer.

10:36.190 --> 10:38.690
She found an encrypted
link to a web page.

10:38.710 --> 10:39.480
Where'd it take you?

10:39.510 --> 10:42.850
Uh,an unsearchable, untraceable
blog with tons of journal entries.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.190
It's like some sort of diary.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.520
You find anything incriminating?

10:45.540 --> 10:48.510
I was able to differentiate between
2 distinct voices, 2 authors.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.280
I found various idiosyncratic
words, phrases,punctuation,

10:51.300 --> 10:54.210
And orthography within the blog entries
consistent with each separate person--

10:54.230 --> 10:55.780
Words like "soda" and "pop."

10:55.800 --> 10:58.870
One guy uses dashes while
the other uses ellipses.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.760
Where'd you find this kid?

11:02.770 --> 11:05.850
He was left in a basket
on the steps of the F.B.I.

11:05.860 --> 11:09.870
One side of the discourse made
a reference to the devil's strip.

11:09.880 --> 11:10.870
What the hell's that?

11:10.890 --> 11:14.000
Uh,it's a small patch of grass that
separates the sidewalk from the street.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.380
Now,that term is only
used in central ohio.

11:16.390 --> 11:19.240
William lived in Atlanta for 20
years, but he grew up in columbus.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.620
The other guy uses words like
"turnpike" and "filling the gas tank,"

11:22.640 --> 11:25.330
Both specific regionalisms for florida.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.530
Kid,you sure about this? Right.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.760
Was there a new development?

11:34.770 --> 11:37.990
"can't rember the last time I
smiled for so long that it hurt.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.280
I've never felt like this before."

11:40.330 --> 11:42.260
Sounds like you're bored at home.

11:42.270 --> 11:43.770
Havin' an affair?

11:43.780 --> 11:46.880
I told you i'm happily married.

11:46.890 --> 11:49.750
Does your wife know
about your secret diary?

11:49.770 --> 11:52.280
I bet she'd like to know how
good you are at keeping secrets.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.380
I'm not sure what you
think you've found,

11:54.400 --> 11:58.580
But you've gone from completely
wrong to completely insane.

11:58.590 --> 11:59.850
You're hiding something,William.

11:59.860 --> 12:04.140
No jury will convict me because
somebody saw me at the mall

12:04.160 --> 12:07.920
And you think i'm talking with
someone other than my wife.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.330
We found Missy.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.890
Told you so.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.280
You son of a bitch!

12:15.290 --> 12:18.990
- Detective,no!
- Damn you!

12:23.160 --> 12:26.090
That's her. That's Missy.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.410
I looked her father in the eye
and swore i'd find her alive.

12:29.710 --> 12:32.850
So since we've been here,this girl's
gone missing and now turned up dead.

12:32.860 --> 12:35.530
Do you think he dumped the
body before he was picked up?

12:35.540 --> 12:38.210
The m.e.estimates she was
killed several hours ago.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.800
But we've had William Harris in custody.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.780
You think we have the wrong guy?

12:42.790 --> 12:43.910
I don't think so.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.710
He's communicating with someone.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.790
He's confident they
won't turn against him.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.340
I don't think he's having an affair.

12:50.350 --> 12:51.660
He has a partner.

12:51.690 --> 12:55.190
And that partner's doing everything
he can to get Harris out of jail.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.390
"I love the challenges..." "the
only suspense for tonight..."

13:03.400 --> 13:06.110
"was tough,but I figured it
out..." "perfect timing..."

13:06.120 --> 13:08.760
"I watch them chase
their little spawns..."

13:08.770 --> 13:12.670
"...passage truly.those
first few hours are the best."

13:12.680 --> 13:16.120
"faith should never be broken."

13:17.090 --> 13:19.190
Tell me you found his partner.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.100
Reid.

13:21.110 --> 13:23.740
It's all so cryptic.

13:26.690 --> 13:29.280
"the end of the day came too soon."

13:29.300 --> 13:31.510
Well,they clearly
enjoyed being together.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.300
They wrote a cluster of others right after
the first victim, kim groves,Was killed.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.850
we need to figure out how they met.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.990
There's gotta be something in
all this about their courtship.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.040
"it all seemed so hopeless, but I
finally learned to rise above it."

13:43.070 --> 13:45.560
It sounds like William confessed
he was feeling incomplete.

13:45.570 --> 13:46.800
He was.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.320
He didn't start killing
until he met his soul mate.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.650
"faith should never be broken."

13:51.670 --> 13:54.810
The longer they got away with it,
the stronger their relationship.

13:55.550 --> 13:57.710
Sounds like these two aren't just
obsessed with rape and murder.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.930
They're addicted to one another.

14:00.570 --> 14:01.990
We could have saved her.

14:02.010 --> 14:05.050
There were no signs of his
having a partner until now.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.710
I guess that's why he's so cocky.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.110
Well,his arrogance is typical
of a dominant personality.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.360
He's found a submissive
who's willing to kill for him.

14:11.390 --> 14:12.750
The partner is a biter.

14:12.770 --> 14:14.980
We found marks on Missy Dewald.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.290
They never did that before.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.430
Well,with William out of the
picture, he's changed his behavior.

14:18.450 --> 14:22.410
Maybe the partner went back to something
that's comfortable, something he's done before.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.770
I've got Garcia checking dental
records against other cases.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.510
D.A.was ready to charge him
when Missy was still alive.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.710
How the hell are we
supposed to keep him now?

14:38.070 --> 14:41.380
I'm surprised you're writing
all this stuff to a fella.

14:41.390 --> 14:44.360
Sounds like you have a
real special thing goin' on.

14:44.390 --> 14:46.330
I mean,i'm thinkin' if the
two of you had just got it on,

14:46.370 --> 14:48.720
Maybe these women would still be alive.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.390
So where'd you meet him?

14:50.410 --> 14:52.930
Chat room? Porn sites? Gay bar?

14:52.940 --> 14:56.560
Whoever this guy is, he's lookin'
out for you, cleaned up for you.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.210
Missy Dewald is dead.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.910
Has he called yet?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.520
Lee jarvis,the D.A.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.670
I saw his name on the warrant.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.020
He's got the best
conviction rate in florida.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.580
Do you know why?

15:09.610 --> 15:12.930
I wanna know why your pen pal killed
her when he could have let her rot.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.360
Jarvis doesn't like to lose.

15:15.370 --> 15:18.570
He's not gonna ruin
his record over this.

15:18.590 --> 15:21.870
Wow, this friend of yours wants
to please you bad,doesn't he?

15:21.900 --> 15:26.100
Oh,he is protecting you, doin' whatever he's
gotta do to make sure that you're innocent.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.570
He killed Missy so you
could be together again.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.650
It's only been a few
hours, but he misses you.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.800
And you've gotten what
exactly from all this?

15:35.830 --> 15:39.340
Proof that someone out
there is just as sick as you.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.740
It turns out there's a lot of
sick pups in central florida.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.330
Today's dental records do
not match William Harris,

15:46.360 --> 15:49.660
But do match a reported rape in
manatee county earlier this year.

15:49.690 --> 15:50.970
That's great. You got a match.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.670
Yeah,the teeth belong
to the same person,

15:52.700 --> 15:55.030
But they've never been arrested,so
I can't cross-reference.

15:55.050 --> 15:56.140
What about the victim?

15:56.180 --> 15:59.580
Connie mayers. She
still lives in the area.

16:00.580 --> 16:04.590
They're gonna ask who
you are. They don't know.

16:05.350 --> 16:08.390
- We're just buying flowers.
- Those daisies are nice.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.550
In your report,uh, it says your attacker
knew what he wanted, that he was confident.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.460
More like a control freak.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.190
He wore a mask, but I
could tell he was white.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.920
He choked me.

16:21.930 --> 16:25.140
Took a long time for
the bruises to go away.

16:26.430 --> 16:30.140
I swear when the light's right, I
can still see his hand right here.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.020
I'm sorry.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.340
It's not as bad as the bite marks.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.750
I mean, they're scars now.

16:38.770 --> 16:42.400
I haven't been with anyone since,
so I haven't had to explain.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.050
- Let me wrap these for you.
- Thank you.

16:47.160 --> 16:51.170
Connie mayers described an
anger-excitation rapist just like William.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.190
So we're lookin' at 2
dominant personalities.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.600
Makes sense. They have a similar
discourse. They're equally well-written.

16:56.610 --> 16:59.390
- That's a big deal.
- It's rare in criminal partnerships.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.990
If their personalities are the same, their
lives probably mirror one another's as well.

17:04.010 --> 17:06.280
Harris goes to church, on
the board of the p.t.a.,

17:06.300 --> 17:08.650
Coaches his daughter's
soccer team, rarely drinks.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.900
Sounds like a saint.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.520
With a dark side. That's what
he connected to in the partner.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.900
Prentiss and I will go talk to the
family, see if they know who it might be.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.310
2 alpha males won't be easy to break.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.339
The partner is definitely
following the investigation.

17:24.349 --> 17:25.780
Let's do the talking for them.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.530
You want me to put
this out in the public?

17:27.540 --> 17:29.130
We've got something better.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.640
Why would he read it? He
knows William won't be writing.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.470
These men are addicted to each other.

17:33.490 --> 17:36.650
Right now,he needs a fix, and the words
they've shared are all he has to cling to.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.150
His partner wrote "faith
should never be broken."

17:39.170 --> 17:41.190
A betrayal could devastate him.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.180
All we have to say is that
William's cooperating...

17:44.810 --> 17:46.540
And then hope he takes the bait.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.760
Have you noticed William pay
extra attention to anyone?

17:48.790 --> 17:49.540
No.

17:49.550 --> 17:51.970
Or has he gone out of
his way to avoid anyone?

17:51.980 --> 17:55.920
We've been here for 6 months,
still got boxes to unpack.

17:55.930 --> 17:59.150
Suggesting that William's
found time to bond with someone?

17:59.160 --> 18:04.100
You know,we think we know the ones we
love, but everybody can keep secrets.

18:06.060 --> 18:10.000
The man we're looking for
is,uh,just like your dad.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.720
He's smart, strong,confident.

18:13.730 --> 18:15.300
He may have a family also.

18:15.310 --> 18:18.010
Oh,so now you're gonna accuse
someone else's dad of murder.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.820
That's really great.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.570
It is the last thing we wanna do.

18:24.050 --> 18:28.090
We believe the accomplice
has done this before.

18:28.410 --> 18:32.790
That victim described a
white man in his forties.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.650
This may be someone you would recognize.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.720
And there's a good chance
he's gonna check up on you.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.040
And why would he do that?

18:40.070 --> 18:43.210
He's worried about your dad, but he
has no way of communicating with him.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.940
You and your mom are
the next best thing.

18:45.950 --> 18:51.460
He's uncertain right now, and that
may manifest itself in mood swings.

18:54.060 --> 18:56.630
We made a deal after Atlanta.

18:56.650 --> 19:01.290
There wouldn't be a chance
for any more misunderstandings.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.010
And how's that working out for you?

19:05.580 --> 19:07.540
So do you like where you live?

19:07.550 --> 19:09.400
I do. Yeah. D.c.'s nice.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.490
So is this place.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.000
Now it's just like Atlanta.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.870
Everyone thinks my dad's
guilty, and it'll just get worse.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.380
I'm sorry about that.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.230
What have we got so far?

19:25.260 --> 19:29.150
Uh,"we were surprised that you injected
yourself "into the investigation.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.900
You risked a lot in
order to help William."

19:31.920 --> 19:35.160
And killin' Missy tells us
how close you really are.

19:35.180 --> 19:37.990
It must be devastating to learn
that William is here with us.

19:38.020 --> 19:41.020
He's not gonna like that. Sounds
like William's cooperating.

19:41.030 --> 19:44.640
Well,that's exactly what we want him to
believe, so he'll doubt their alliance.

19:49.570 --> 19:52.350
<i>William is here with us.</i>

19:53.780 --> 19:55.340
Most entries followed the first murder.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.730
Yeah,William wrote most of them.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.330
Uh,"I wasn't expecting
that type of gift.

19:59.350 --> 20:03.870
I wish time didn't take away
all the pleasures of the day."

20:10.190 --> 20:12.220
Gotta see this.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.550
What's that smirk?

20:29.560 --> 20:31.580
Sharon is posting bail.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.370
I'm thinkin' about
where to go for dinner.

20:34.380 --> 20:35.750
You know, maybe we got it wrong.

20:35.770 --> 20:38.180
Maybe they'r not both alpha males.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.260
Maybe we'll go to salvatores.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.700
Partner made the first move.
He's the one with the balls.

20:42.710 --> 20:44.810
Yeah,and it was pretty risky,too.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.370
Think about it. What
if you did turn in here?

20:47.380 --> 20:50.060
Or at least your partner
thought you turned in here,hmm?

20:50.080 --> 20:54.070
Then he'd have no choice but to turn
himself in. Your lives would be ruined.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.210
That's the reason it works.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.240
You both have everything to lose.

20:58.270 --> 21:01.350
He's only cleaning up because he can't
afford to get caught either. Am I right?

21:01.360 --> 21:04.960
How is gonna react
to the entry we wrote?

21:04.970 --> 21:08.270
He knows we're reading
your little love letters,

21:08.290 --> 21:11.200
so we decided to send one ourselves,

21:11.230 --> 21:14.090
Let him know you're
in here helping us out.

21:14.110 --> 21:16.920
He's probably feeling pretty
betrayed right about now.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.870
And if he is,what do you
think he's doin' about it?

21:20.170 --> 21:24.070
William,you wrote, "thanks
for the perfect place to play."

21:24.690 --> 21:26.880
What were you talkin' about?

21:26.890 --> 21:29.610
- Golfing.
- Golfing?

21:29.620 --> 21:32.640
Golfing. Right.

21:33.070 --> 21:35.370
What was it like?

21:35.390 --> 21:37.240
Perfect.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.350
I've never let 'em see my face before.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.090
- Me either.
- You think she's gonna talk?

21:47.100 --> 21:50.910
They all think about
it, but,uh,too scared.

21:52.420 --> 21:56.230
I don't know. This one,
this one seems defiant.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.450
Well,I don't think we should risk it.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.770
Blood's... Not my thing.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.300
It doesn't have to be messy.

22:08.090 --> 22:10.830
You mean like this?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.970
Yeah,like that.

22:21.510 --> 22:24.450
You probably don't recognize
'em like this, do you,William?

22:26.670 --> 22:29.360
Happy and smilin'.

22:29.370 --> 22:33.020
All these gifts. All these girls.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.570
This is someone's child.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.550
You know,Missy Dewald, she was
supposed to meet her parents for dinner.

22:41.870 --> 22:45.180
She was 18 years old, an only child,

22:45.460 --> 22:48.400
and you just took her away.

22:48.430 --> 22:52.340
I feel sorry for those
parents. I really do.

22:52.610 --> 22:54.870
Do you hear yourself?

22:54.880 --> 22:57.250
Not an ounce of sincerity.

22:57.260 --> 23:00.550
You just proved you were
incapable of empathy.

23:00.570 --> 23:02.450
Just like your partner.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.490
William,you never would have
done any of this without him.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.560
But you just weren't complete,right?

23:14.440 --> 23:16.460
- Wait. What is that?
- Honey,stay here.

23:16.470 --> 23:18.680
- Mom-- -
stay here.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.750
<i>GET OUT!</i>

23:33.570 --> 23:37.490
What the hell? Aw,damn kids.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.030
Don't you worry,Sharon.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.820
We are gonna take care of this.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.860
Thank you.

23:53.020 --> 23:56.580
"it's been so long, my heart aches.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.150
I need to see that face again soon."

24:03.060 --> 24:06.190
I mean,it's pretty obvious there's an
emotional connection between you two,huh?

24:08.020 --> 24:10.530
Can't deny that.

24:11.680 --> 24:16.360
But,you know,William, doesn't
really sound like 2 buddies to me.

24:16.610 --> 24:19.730
Sounds more like 2 men
in love with each other.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.170
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.390
You're right.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.820
I have absolutely no idea what it's
like to be in love with another man.

24:28.090 --> 24:33.590
You know,everyone who goes into law enforcement--
ahem--has this air of moral superiority.

24:33.600 --> 24:38.150
You,it seeps out of every single pore.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.260
Black cop in the F.B.I.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.590
You got a big chip on your
shoulder, lot to prove.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.950
Now who's the one who has no
idea what he's talkin' about?

24:48.970 --> 24:51.900
We're not so different, you and i.

24:51.910 --> 24:56.400
The games we play, we chose
because they make us feel powerful.

24:56.670 --> 25:01.450
So what do you have,
special agent Morgan?

25:01.940 --> 25:05.630
Prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that I have broken the law.

25:05.640 --> 25:10.280
But don't you sit there with that smug
look on your face and judge me,boy.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.790
First of all, I am not your boy,

25:15.800 --> 25:20.830
and this look on my face is a look
of contempt, because you disgust me.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.160
You and I are nothin' alike.

25:28.820 --> 25:33.140
When we do find this,
uh,friend of yours,

25:33.150 --> 25:36.200
There isn't a jury out there
who won't find you guilty.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.670
How's it goin' in there?

25:42.690 --> 25:44.080
We're just tradin' punches.

25:44.090 --> 25:47.140
He's watchin' the clock, waitin'
for his bail to be posted.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.120
- I can't thank you enough.
- You don't need to thank me.

25:52.130 --> 25:54.980
I just wish I could have
done a better job for you.

25:56.670 --> 25:58.630
What's goin' on?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.580
Steven,uh,cleaned up the mess outside.

26:01.590 --> 26:03.730
- Why?
- Andrea,don't be rude.

26:03.740 --> 26:05.150
It's ok,Sharon.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.460
I--I like to help out
a friend whenever I can.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.710
I didn't even know you
and my dad were friends.

26:09.730 --> 26:13.380
Look,I know how hard
this must be for you.

26:13.410 --> 26:15.240
Just know your dad
is gonna be home soon.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.530
People are gonna forget
this ever happened.

26:17.540 --> 26:20.880
Everything's gonna go back the way it
was before,ok? You guys have a good day.

26:20.890 --> 26:21.900
Thank you.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.260
Somehow I doubt that.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.600
What was that about?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.710
Well,why is he bein'
so nice all of a sudden?

26:29.730 --> 26:32.600
This is exactly what those F.B.I.
People said to look out for.

26:32.610 --> 26:37.210
I will not have you alienate the only person who's
been kind to us since your father was arrested.

26:37.230 --> 26:39.800
You understand me?

26:46.290 --> 26:47.300
You got something?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.970
One day,the partner wrote,"I
feel like such an outsider.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.140
"no one understands me.

26:51.180 --> 26:54.400
"I watch them chase their little
spawns, the same old conversations.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.840
Nothing stimulates me."

26:55.860 --> 26:57.170
Sounds like a party with kids.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.340
Yeah,and somebody was
not happy to be there.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.770
"I looked over, and everything
changed. The only spark in my day."

27:02.780 --> 27:06.680
This is it. It's buried in a later entry, but
he's talking about the first time they met.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.900
"I looked across the room,
and everything changed.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.790
The only spark in my day."

27:18.820 --> 27:22.150
"it feels so good, so free,so right."

27:22.650 --> 27:25.410
You moved here 6 months ago.

27:25.420 --> 27:28.490
You met him some time
after that, didn't you?

27:34.260 --> 27:37.280
Thanks,man. Here you go,buddy.

27:37.290 --> 27:38.800
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

27:38.810 --> 27:40.500
- Will Harris.
- Steve baleman.

27:40.510 --> 27:42.050
- Saw you movin' in last week.
- Ah,yeah.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.590
- You all unpacked?
- Ah, for the most part.

27:44.600 --> 27:48.020
But my wife Sharon,
she's,uh-- she's amazing.

27:48.030 --> 27:50.180
She takes care of the house.
I take care of everything else.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.690
That's a good woman.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.090
Let me tell you, took me a while,
but I finally got annie trained.

27:55.110 --> 27:56.750
Hey,sweetie.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.590
You're a lucky man.

28:02.150 --> 28:04.920
- What do we have here?
- Thank you.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.220
Aw,you're too kind, ladies.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.400
You know,most people around here would be
pretty excited about this plain old burger here.

28:15.410 --> 28:18.310
But,uh,it's really nothin' special.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.390
Well,a good piece of meat would be nice.

28:23.530 --> 28:25.800
Stick to your bones,huh?

28:25.810 --> 28:28.050
Bloody rare and tender.

28:29.210 --> 28:33.040
Well,uh,variety is the spice of life.

28:34.220 --> 28:36.400
I couldn't agree more.

28:37.270 --> 28:39.310
Cheers.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.130
You think that's funny?

28:42.150 --> 28:44.770
No,I just remembered something.

28:44.780 --> 28:46.230
I really hope you enjoy these memories,

28:46.270 --> 28:48.440
Because they're all you're
gonna have in prison.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.000
You know what you are? You're lost.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.970
I think you've been runnin' from yourself
your entire life, tryin' to disappear.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.080
Did I say something that upset you?

29:04.110 --> 29:06.130
What'd you think you were gonna do,man?

29:06.440 --> 29:10.020
what, if you got away from Atlanta, all
these little urges,they'd just go away?

29:10.030 --> 29:12.120
So you go find another posh
little uppity neighborhood,

29:12.160 --> 29:14.460
And you think it might make you
feel a little better about yourself?

29:14.500 --> 29:16.960
Make you feel whole, more complete?

29:17.000 --> 29:18.900
Didn't work too well, though,did it?

29:18.940 --> 29:23.450
Nah,nothin' seems to make William happy,
not even his beautiful wife and daughter.

29:23.670 --> 29:26.250
But then you wake up
one day, and there he is,

29:26.270 --> 29:30.100
Somebody just as sick and pathetic as
you are, And your whole world changes.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.650
Is all this about that black comment?

29:34.670 --> 29:37.680
You really think that we're the
same because of our skin color?

29:37.700 --> 29:39.660
That's all we have in common.

29:39.700 --> 29:43.360
You hurt innocent people. I don't.

29:44.490 --> 29:45.690
You're not even a man.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.860
- That a fact?
- That is a fact.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.490
If you had anything,
i'd be in a cell by now.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.720
You will be.

30:00.370 --> 30:03.940
Shouldn't be outside,Andrea.
It's not safe.

30:03.950 --> 30:06.390
Oh,wait. Your dad's in jail.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.820
We have nothing to worry about.

30:08.830 --> 30:09.940
What's your problem?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.910
My problem? I'm not the
one with the freaky family.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.720
Shut up.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.970
Is that why you moved from Atlanta?

30:15.980 --> 30:18.250
Your dad was rapin' ****

30:18.270 --> 30:19.190
he didn't do it.

30:19.210 --> 30:21.260
That's not what the newspaper said.

30:21.270 --> 30:24.520
You know,you're about the
same age as those girls.

30:24.540 --> 30:27.030
I bet he started with you.

30:27.640 --> 30:31.110
- What's goin' on over there?
- Nothin'.

30:31.250 --> 30:34.460
Everybody needs to go home right now.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.340
Loser.

30:39.790 --> 30:42.710
- You ok?
- Yeah. They're just being jerks.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.780
Now,look,I saw your mom was gone.

30:44.790 --> 30:47.210
If you need any company, i'm around,ok?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.960
I'm fine. Really. Really.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.540
Reid,we need to figure
out where that party was.

30:57.570 --> 30:58.560
Let's review one more time.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.410
I'm a serial killer writing my partner.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.350
Why do I keep a secret blog?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.120
It's a safe way to relive your crimes.

31:04.140 --> 31:07.860
Uh,no one ever sees you together,
and,uh,no one overhears you talking.

31:07.870 --> 31:08.900
I'd buy all that.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.540
Sounds like they take
turns surprising each other.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.580
Uh,listen to this. "I
love the challenges.

31:13.590 --> 31:16.280
"the timing is always
perfect. "thanks for tonight.

31:16.290 --> 31:20.030
It was tough, but I figured it out.
Nothing was gonna keep me away."

31:20.040 --> 31:21.700
What are you thinking?

31:21.720 --> 31:23.570
They never write about a time.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.900
So how'd they know when to meet?

31:28.750 --> 31:30.570
Steven, what are you doing?

31:30.590 --> 31:32.810
Don't walk away! We
need to talk about this!

31:32.820 --> 31:36.020
I told you, leave me alone!

31:47.250 --> 31:48.310
What have we got?

31:48.350 --> 31:50.330
All 4 victims were abducted
at different times of day.

31:50.370 --> 31:51.360
It was never consistent.

31:51.380 --> 31:54.640
One was even taken on thanksgiving morning
when she went to the market for her mom.

31:54.660 --> 31:58.530
Other than the blog, there is nothing else
suspicious on Mr. Sneaky's phone or his computer.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.920
All texts,numbers, and files
have been accounted for.

32:01.930 --> 32:03.560
What did they do to communicate?

32:03.570 --> 32:06.110
We're missing something.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.890
We know based on the language
and the knowledge of the area that

32:18.910 --> 32:21.770
The partner was most likely
born and raised in florida.

32:21.780 --> 32:24.850
All right,let's work with the theory
that the partner lives in sarasota.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.230
They don't call. They don't write.

32:26.240 --> 32:29.120
The signal could be something visual,
or it could be something audible.

32:29.150 --> 32:31.560
Ok, if it's visual, that could
be hanging a flag on their house.

32:31.590 --> 32:34.490
And if it's audible, they'd obviously have
to live close enough to each other to hear it.

32:34.530 --> 32:37.310
Something audible.
Something you can hear.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.040
What if...

32:39.050 --> 32:41.250
What if they're not writing
poetry to each other?

32:41.280 --> 32:44.280
What if they're writing
lyrics to a song?

32:44.310 --> 32:48.750
Uh,"this feels so
good, so free,so right."

32:48.760 --> 32:50.250
Give me something else.

32:50.270 --> 32:53.430
Uh,"it looks so right.
It's all I need tonight."

32:55.760 --> 32:57.680
I found it.

32:58.450 --> 33:01.430
Garcia,that's it. That was playing
when we pulled in to the cul-de-sac.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.920
It was coming out of a car.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.150
that's the signal. That's how they
knew to go back to Missy Dewald.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.560
The partner lives nearby. That's where
they met. It was a neighborhood party.

33:19.570 --> 33:22.130
Garcia,we need to know
which neighbor it is.

33:22.150 --> 33:23.310
Give me the parameters again.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.370
We're looking for a while
male. Married, with children.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.140
He's either got a good steady
job, or he owns his own business.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.770
He's lived in florida his entire life.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.910
Within close proximity to
William, there are 7 white males.

33:50.950 --> 33:52.550
5 are married with children.

33:52.570 --> 33:54.730
2 were born and raised
in the sunshine state.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.350
One is on disability.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.670
One owns a real estate business.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.330
Oh,my god. He lives right next door.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.350
Steven baleman.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.300
Steven baleman.

34:39.810 --> 34:43.020
Are you following me? Are you?

34:47.199 --> 34:48.900
He was angry and just took off.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.260
- Why was he upset?
- He's been like this all day.

34:51.270 --> 34:54.139
- When did it start?
- I don't know.

34:54.150 --> 34:55.560
This morning.

34:55.590 --> 34:59.520
So after William was arrested, he
became hostile, didn't he,nervous?

34:59.550 --> 35:01.300
Steven is a good man.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.630
He's not who you think he is.

35:05.060 --> 35:08.220
Andrea. Andrea.

35:08.230 --> 35:10.800
- Did you see Andrea out here?
- No.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.500
Why is annie crying?

35:13.510 --> 35:15.790
We think that Steven
is William's accomplice.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.800
Where's Steven?

35:16.820 --> 35:19.360
- We're trying to figure that out.
- Oh,my god.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.580
Andrea said it was strange
that he was the only nice one.

35:23.590 --> 35:26.180
He was checking in on us.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.480
I wasn't listening. I'm sorry.

35:28.490 --> 35:30.430
Now they're both gone.

35:30.450 --> 35:32.780
It's time you talked to William.

35:34.140 --> 35:36.790
No,Steven baleman is
not just your neighbor.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.050
And you know this how?

35:38.060 --> 35:39.860
You told us.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.690
Those don't prove anything.

35:41.700 --> 35:46.900
And after all this time, you figuring out who
my neighbor is feels like a really small victory.

35:51.930 --> 35:54.440
Where did Steven take Andrea?

35:54.930 --> 35:56.950
Wh-what are you talkin' about?

35:56.970 --> 36:00.660
She suspected him, and
now they're both missing.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.440
How could you? She believed you.

36:03.450 --> 36:05.190
Th-they're missing?

36:05.210 --> 36:08.070
All those times you disappeared,
i knew it wasn't work.

36:08.090 --> 36:12.890
i thought maybe, maybe
you were having an affair,

36:12.900 --> 36:16.520
And I couldn't confront you,because
then that would make it real.

36:17.400 --> 36:21.230
Then i'd have to find the
truth buried in your lies,

36:21.240 --> 36:24.870
And you have been paid
to lie for so long.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.550
It is who you are!

36:26.560 --> 36:31.760
Look,all of this is almost too much.
It's too much for anybody to put up with.

36:31.770 --> 36:34.210
But it's almost over.

36:34.230 --> 36:36.510
I didn't put up the house.

36:38.050 --> 36:40.900
You--you didn't
post bail?

36:41.400 --> 36:44.470
I didn't wanna believe it in Atlanta,
and i'm not gonna deny it again.

36:44.490 --> 36:48.040
Now,where did Steven take Andrea?

36:48.670 --> 36:52.860
Where is she? Where is...

36:54.150 --> 36:58.610
You son of a--
you son of a bitch!

37:06.300 --> 37:08.080
How'd that feel, William?

37:08.090 --> 37:10.430
You see what you're doin'?

37:11.560 --> 37:16.180
Kim groves,your words-- "the
first few hours are the best.

37:16.220 --> 37:19.040
Nobody's run out of steam yet."

37:19.070 --> 37:23.460
Andrea's been gone for 2 hours.

37:23.500 --> 37:27.000
What's he doing to her right now?

37:27.030 --> 37:30.440
What is he doin', William? Touchin' her?

37:31.190 --> 37:32.960
Maybe he's bitin' her,huh?

37:32.980 --> 37:35.760
This is what he does
when you're not around.

37:35.770 --> 37:40.180
Your little boyfriend is twisted,
and now he's got your baby girl.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.950
You know better than us.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.900
Has she been in pain this whole time?

37:46.410 --> 37:48.440
Steven took your daughter.

37:48.470 --> 37:52.740
The man you trusted with
your life has betrayed you.

37:53.380 --> 37:56.470
What,is nothin' sacred to you?

38:00.890 --> 38:04.150
So Steven baleman has a couple of commercial
properties, but so far,there's nothing.

38:04.180 --> 38:06.550
Only he knows where Steven took Andrea.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.820
I can't believe he sold out his
daughter to protect his partner.

38:09.850 --> 38:12.000
He's protecting himself.

38:12.010 --> 38:14.240
The minute he says
anything, he's guilty.

38:14.270 --> 38:16.670
What was it you said about Missy,hmm?

38:16.700 --> 38:19.660
Man,turn around and look at me!

38:20.880 --> 38:24.550
For every minute that goes
by, he's alone with her,right?

38:24.980 --> 38:28.050
Well,it's Andrea's turn now.

38:28.060 --> 38:29.410
What is wrong with you,man?

38:29.430 --> 38:32.300
Why aren't you tryin' to run out
that door and save your child?

38:32.330 --> 38:34.570
You think he's not gonna hurt her? Why?

38:34.580 --> 38:38.390
Did you make some kind of
deal? Family's off-limits?

38:38.400 --> 38:42.430
The longer you are in here,
the worse it looked for Steven.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.330
He think you're in here betraying
him, so now he's actin' out.

38:45.350 --> 38:46.690
He's lost faith.

38:46.730 --> 38:50.370
He is alone with your little girl.

38:51.020 --> 38:55.060
She's probably cryin' out for you,
sayin',"daddy,daddy, why aren't you helpin' me?"

38:55.080 --> 38:58.590
Why? Because you're
standin' here, doin' nothin'.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.220
William...

39:04.250 --> 39:07.190
You're the only person
who can stop this.

39:08.290 --> 39:12.650
Be a man. For god sakes, be a father.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.870
Andrea!

39:25.920 --> 39:28.590
- Oh,dad,thank god.
- You're gonna be ok.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.040
It's Steven. It's Steven.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.460
I don't know where
he went. I don't know.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.470
I'm gonna get you out of here.

39:36.190 --> 39:38.890
- Did he hurt you?
- Did you think i'd hurt her?

39:38.900 --> 39:41.230
That i'd betray you?

39:41.240 --> 39:44.150
Or is that because
that's what you did to me?

39:44.160 --> 39:46.930
I didn't tell them anything.

39:48.380 --> 39:52.120
You didn't tell them anything?
Dad,what are you talking about?

39:52.130 --> 39:54.740
Wait. How did you even
know that I was here?

39:54.750 --> 39:57.080
Andrea,honey, trust me.

39:57.140 --> 40:00.090
Daddy's gonna make it ok. Ok?

40:01.150 --> 40:02.270
We had a deal.

40:02.290 --> 40:04.500
Faith should never be broken.

40:04.530 --> 40:07.710
- You took my daughter!
- She followed me here!

40:08.330 --> 40:11.200
She never would have said anything.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.750
I never would have said anything?

40:15.620 --> 40:19.060
Honey, Andrea,please.

40:19.070 --> 40:22.230
Just--just trust
me. Trust me,ok?

40:22.240 --> 40:24.840
So how'd you get out?

40:26.490 --> 40:29.190
Uh,the case-- the
case was dismissed.

40:29.210 --> 40:31.960
Oh,really? Simple as that?

40:31.970 --> 40:34.110
You killed msy Dewald
while I was in custody.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.670
They didn't have enough to hold me.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.890
He talked about Missy. We got him.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.700
So he killed Missy Dewald, and what?

40:39.730 --> 40:41.910
What? You killed all the others?

40:41.920 --> 40:44.510
- Honey,please.
- No.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.090
Don't--don't
come close to me.

40:47.100 --> 40:50.430
I had your back.

40:51.050 --> 40:54.290
What were you gonna do?
What if I hadn't shown up?

40:54.300 --> 40:57.050
Were you gonna kill her?

41:01.440 --> 41:03.960
- F.B.I.!
- Don't move! You're under arrest!

41:03.970 --> 41:06.350
Don't even think about it!

41:12.390 --> 41:15.100
Andrea. Andrea.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
Mom. Mom,get me out of
here. Get me out of here.

41:41.970 --> 41:43.780
Ok. You're gonna be ok.

41:43.790 --> 41:47.270
- I wanna go away,ok?
- Ok. I promise,baby.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.620
The guy wanted just to
see his partner again.

41:52.630 --> 41:55.370
They needed to say good-bye.

41:55.380 --> 41:59.790
Those two had everything figured
out except how it would end.

42:11.510 --> 42:14.270
British historian C.
Northcote Parkinson said,

42:14.280 --> 42:17.250
"delay is the deadliest form of denial."
