00:12.170 --> 00:15.580
Commander, away team reporting in.
Lt Worf standing by.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.680
This is Riker. Go ahead, Lieutenant.

00:18.780 --> 00:22.380
The archaeologists have identified
the markings in these caverns.

00:22.550 --> 00:27.120
This planet was once home
to a race known as the Koinonians.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.260
What do we know, Data?

00:29.420 --> 00:31.430
The Koinonians were a culture

00:31.590 --> 00:34.830
which became embroiled in a war
that lasted generations.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.670
Our evidence indicates
they destroyed themselves.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.800
We have completed our survey

00:39.970 --> 00:42.400
and will proceed to the chamber.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.340
Affirmative. Enterprise out.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.740
Destroyed themselves, Data?

00:47.910 --> 00:49.480
According to records,

00:49.640 --> 00:51.850
this will be the first opportunity...

00:52.010 --> 00:54.580
Captain... Beam them up quickly!

00:55.120 --> 00:59.120
Captain. Emergency beam-up.
Enterprise. Severe injuries.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.620
Transporter room.
Beam them straight to sickbay!

01:02.790 --> 01:04.590
Dr Crusher, incoming wounded!

01:16.070 --> 01:18.470
Away team is on board, Captain.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.550
One dead on arrival.

01:53.710 --> 01:56.540
Space, the final frontier.

01:58.210 --> 02:01.250
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.550
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:07.890 --> 02:11.430
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

02:12.330 --> 02:16.160
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.360
Captain's log, stardate 43198.7.
The Enterprise remains in orbit

03:21.600 --> 03:25.700
while we investigate the tragedy
which has struck the away team.

03:25.870 --> 03:28.240
Lt Marla Aster,
ship's archaeologist,

03:28.440 --> 03:31.140
has been killed
on a routine mission.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.640
Whatever the explanation,

03:33.810 --> 03:36.850
it will not bring back
a valued officer.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.320
Lieutenant?

03:43.650 --> 03:47.290
We had completed our investigation
of the third tunnel.

03:47.460 --> 03:51.860
Our scans indicated no weapons
or traps of any kind.

03:52.030 --> 03:55.330
Lt Aster
was three meters behind me.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.200
An explosive device went off.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.870
There was no warning.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.510
Lt Aster bore
the full brunt of the detonation.

04:16.149 --> 04:19.850
Lt Aster is survived
by a son, Jeremy.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.390
12 years old.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.030
He's aboard the Enterprise, sir.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.730
- And his father?
- He's also deceased.

04:29.700 --> 04:33.770
His only living relatives
are an aunt and uncle on Earth.

04:40.210 --> 04:45.250
- Where is he now?
- In class. The teacher expects us.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.950
Captain.

04:51.820 --> 04:55.260
I must accompany you.
I commanded the away team.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.490
I appreciate your offer, Lieutenant.
This is my responsibility.

05:07.340 --> 05:12.310
Picard to bridge. La Forge
will lead another away team.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.840
- I want to know what happened.
- Yes, Captain.

05:14.980 --> 05:18.810
I will be with Counselor Troi
and young Jeremy Aster.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.380
I understand. Riker out.

05:32.830 --> 05:37.830
- He had to do this for me.
- Do you know Jeremy well?

05:39.070 --> 05:41.640
But I know what this will be like
for him.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.540
That's part of life in Starfleet.

05:45.540 --> 05:50.110
I know. They prepare us for anything,
but still...

05:50.280 --> 05:52.010
I know.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.720
How do you get used to it?
Telling them.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.390
You hope you never do.

06:36.660 --> 06:40.800
I sense the weight
of this duty on you, Captain.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.000
I really wonder...

06:48.770 --> 06:50.270
Halt.

06:57.150 --> 07:01.180
I've always believed that carrying
children on a starship...

07:02.720 --> 07:05.420
...is a very questionable policy.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.360
Serving on a starship means
accepting certain risks...

07:13.730 --> 07:15.230
...certain dangers.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.500
Did Jeremy Aster make that choice?

07:21.900 --> 07:25.540
Death and loss are an integral part
of life everywhere.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.340
Leaving him on Earth
would not protect him.

07:29.510 --> 07:33.720
But the Earth won't be ordered
to the Neutral Zone.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.920
My command sent
his mother to her death.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.790
She understood
her mission and my duty.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.890
Will he?

07:45.060 --> 07:48.060
In time... and with help.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.130
Wesley Crusher does.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.400
He does.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.070
And so will Jeremy.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.780
Resume.

08:17.330 --> 08:22.130
Jeremy, I have some bad news.
There has been an accident.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.200
Your mother... has died.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.650
How, sir?

08:38.809 --> 08:41.780
An explosive device
at the mission site.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.720
She died instantly.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.120
I understand.

08:48.290 --> 08:52.430
Jeremy, I know your mother
loved you very much.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.700
I am told... that your father
is also dead.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.200
Yes, sir.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.880
He died five years ago
from a Rushton infection.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.920
I'm all alone now, sir.

09:16.580 --> 09:21.590
Jeremy, on the Starship Enterprise,
no one is alone.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.760
No one.

09:42.610 --> 09:45.280
Excuse me, sir. Am I intruding?

09:46.610 --> 09:48.350
No, sit down.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.160
How well did you know
Lt Aster?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.660
We spent some time together.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.000
Not very well.

10:06.530 --> 10:08.870
- How well did you know her?
- Why do you ask?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.540
- Well, you asked me.
- But why ask the question?

10:14.440 --> 10:17.610
Since her death,
I have been asked several times

10:17.780 --> 10:19.850
how well I knew Lt Aster.

10:20.450 --> 10:24.590
And I heard you ask Wesley
how well he knew Jeremy.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.920
Does the question of familiarity

10:28.060 --> 10:29.920
have some bearing on death?

10:33.260 --> 10:35.630
Do you remember when Tasha died?

10:38.900 --> 10:42.500
I do not sense
the same feelings of absence

10:42.640 --> 10:44.470
as with Lt Yar.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.910
Although I cannot say
precisely why.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.680
- Just human nature.
- Human nature, sir?

10:51.310 --> 10:55.150
We feel a loss more intensely
when it's a friend.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.620
But should not the feelings
run as deep,

10:59.790 --> 11:01.660
regardless of who has died?

11:04.660 --> 11:06.060
Maybe they should.

11:06.230 --> 11:11.030
Maybe if we felt any loss as keenly
as for one close to us,

11:12.630 --> 11:15.000
human history would be less bloody.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.510
- La Forge to Riker.
- You're back.

11:18.670 --> 11:21.340
Yes, sir.
We've brought back a souvenir.

11:24.010 --> 11:28.480
There are five more, all identical
to the one that killed Lt Aster.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.420
They employ
a subspace proximity detonator.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.760
A tricorder would never detect it.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.690
How long would they have been there?

11:36.860 --> 11:39.860
It comes from the time
of the Koinonian Wars, sir.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.530
- Did you find them all, Geordi?
- Yeah, but...

11:44.370 --> 11:47.940
Well, it seemed like
they were left to be found.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.570
Left by whom?
There are no indications of life.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.640
I don't know, Captain.

11:53.810 --> 11:57.650
But they were recently pulled
out of the ground and defused.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.320
I have made my report.

12:04.490 --> 12:08.620
I'm more interested
in how you feel about what happened.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.460
I sense great anger.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.030
I cannot seek revenge
against an enemy

12:17.170 --> 12:19.370
who's turned to dust centuries ago.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.100
Her death was senseless!

12:23.670 --> 12:26.340
The last victim of a forgotten war!

12:30.050 --> 12:31.710
Go on.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.480
There's nothing more to be said.

12:39.790 --> 12:43.860
A person died under your command.
It may happen again.

12:44.030 --> 12:48.600
If you can't learn to release
the anger and guilt, to talk...

12:48.760 --> 12:50.570
A leader must stand alone.

12:51.370 --> 12:55.270
- As Capt Picard does.
- Capt Picard talks to me.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.580
Then...

13:05.750 --> 13:10.790
may I seek counsel on my plan
to make R'uustai with the boy?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.520
- The Bonding?
- It is my right.

13:15.790 --> 13:20.660
It's very generous, Worf,
but... he's not a Klingon child.

13:20.830 --> 13:23.100
He has different sensibilities.

13:23.260 --> 13:27.740
He is an orphan. I am an orphan.
He will understand.

13:28.970 --> 13:32.170
Right now
there isn't much he can understand.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.610
He is holding
all his feelings inside.

13:37.910 --> 13:43.520
Children often feel they must be true
to the memory of a lost parent.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.820
If you offer affection too soon,

13:45.990 --> 13:48.920
they can feel guilty
returning that affection,

13:49.090 --> 13:51.590
as if they're betraying
the love of the parent.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.360
I only wish to honor his mother.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.400
I know and I understand
this means a great deal to you.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.210
But you must be prepared.

14:05.370 --> 14:10.080
He's very angry, too,
but his anger is deep inside him.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.310
When he touches it, it will strike
out in many directions,

14:13.480 --> 14:15.250
including yours.

14:16.150 --> 14:18.350
Be with him.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.390
Talk to him,
but don't rush this.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.090
When he's ready, we'll know.

14:35.140 --> 14:39.940
Capt Patches, an alien ship!
What shall we do?

14:40.110 --> 14:42.240
Oh, no! We've been hit!
We're going down.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.250
That was great! Get a shot of Mom.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.220
What are you doing?
I'll turn your lens to shards!

14:51.390 --> 14:54.820
Go away! Go away! Over there!

14:58.660 --> 15:00.000
Patches!

15:01.300 --> 15:04.330
Capt Patches is landing on the sofa!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.630
Oh, no! He's gonna crash!

15:19.010 --> 15:23.850
Jeremy Aster?
I'm Lt Worf. May I enter?

15:25.820 --> 15:27.790
You were in command.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.630
Yes. I was with Lt Aster...

15:32.890 --> 15:34.900
...your mother, when she died.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.740
- You're a Klingon, aren't you?
- Yes.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.040
We studied about Klingons in school.

15:49.180 --> 15:54.250
- What did they teach you?
- You used to be our enemies.

15:54.780 --> 15:59.950
Did they teach you that we hope
to die in the line of duty?

16:05.130 --> 16:10.100
In my tradition, we do not grieve
the loss of the body.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.940
We celebrate the releasing
of the spirit.

16:15.470 --> 16:18.640
I understand death.
They teach us all about it.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.910
Jeremy Aster,

16:22.410 --> 16:27.480
we both understand. But we must bring
meaning into your mother's death.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.590
Perhaps we can do it together.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.330
Come.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.840
Counselor, how's the boy?

16:50.010 --> 16:52.570
- He's being very brave.
- Good.

16:53.070 --> 16:56.240
No, he has to get past brave.

16:56.410 --> 17:00.180
He's very angry
and he has to express that anger

17:00.350 --> 17:03.250
before he can say goodbye
to his mother.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.020
How can we help?

17:07.190 --> 17:10.089
Well, I've asked Beverly
to get Wesley

17:10.260 --> 17:13.089
to talk to Jeremy
about his father's death.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.569
The one unusual element is Worf.

17:19.270 --> 17:22.640
In many ways, he is suffering
as badly as the boy.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.940
He wishes to involve Jeremy
in a Klingon ceremony

17:26.109 --> 17:28.380
called R'uustai, the Bonding.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.920
I know of that.
Perhaps it would help them.

17:34.420 --> 17:38.790
I don't think Jeremy's ready
for Worf now. Perhaps later.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.560
It will have to be handled
delicately.

17:41.720 --> 17:46.900
As you always do.
I break the unpleasant news

17:47.060 --> 17:50.730
and there my responsibility ends.
But you...

17:50.900 --> 17:54.740
You have to stay with them
through the grieving process.

17:55.770 --> 17:59.640
We deal with our pain
in many different ways.

18:00.540 --> 18:03.350
Over the years,
I've discovered it's in joy

18:03.510 --> 18:06.450
that the uniqueness
of each individual is revealed.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.690
If I can help a person
back to joy...

18:11.490 --> 18:14.290
...well, my role has its rewards.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.360
Captain, we're picking up
energy on the planet's surface.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.870
Location?

18:27.640 --> 18:31.510
Two kilometers north
of the away team's beam-down point.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.110
Full scan.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.080
- Inconclusive, Captain.
- Sir,

18:38.250 --> 18:41.750
I'm sensing a presence on the planet.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.720
- Very vague.
- Life form?

18:43.850 --> 18:48.120
I can't be sure. The emotions
of the crew are so strong now,

18:48.290 --> 18:50.690
it's difficult to filter them out.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.560
Data, scan analysis on main viewer.

19:04.070 --> 19:05.240
Hi.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.510
Hi.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.780
Troi stopped by.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.250
She was wondering if you'd talk
to Jeremy Aster.

19:16.750 --> 19:17.690
Me?

19:21.260 --> 19:23.930
- What for?
- About your dad.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.460
What will I tell him?

19:28.630 --> 19:32.530
It would help to talk
to someone who's been through this.

19:34.840 --> 19:39.170
We had each other. He doesn't
have anyone right now.

19:39.670 --> 19:44.250
He might be more comfortable with
someone who's not so much older.

19:44.380 --> 19:47.150
OK, I'll think about it.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.150
OK.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.570
- Do you think about him, Mom?
- Your father?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.780
Sure I do.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.210
Sometimes...

20:19.810 --> 20:24.890
...I can't even remember what his face
looks like. It scares me.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.390
It happens to all of us, Wes.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.930
Sometimes...

20:35.600 --> 20:38.930
...I can't get his face
out of my mind.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.000
Today...

20:42.170 --> 20:44.140
Today it's like

20:44.310 --> 20:47.840
I can see it all
as if it were yesterday.

20:49.340 --> 20:53.980
I can remember the way Dad looked
when he hugged me goodbye,

20:54.150 --> 20:57.550
Capt Picard's eyes
when he came to tell us...

21:05.290 --> 21:07.530
Data, run comparison
of known phenomena.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.070
The pattern has no match
in Federation records.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.040
- Is it alive?
- A possibility.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.810
Captain.

21:16.970 --> 21:21.010
I'm getting an unusual
magnetic-flux reading from the pods.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.980
My God...

21:24.150 --> 21:25.750
Wait a minute.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.950
You've got ten seconds more, Mom.
No peeking.

21:29.750 --> 21:34.590
Come on, Patches, in here.
OK, Mom, we're ready!

21:34.760 --> 21:37.960
Jeremy? I'm getting closer!

21:39.130 --> 21:42.600
Jeremy? I'm gonna find you!

21:43.300 --> 21:45.370
You must be in here somewhere.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.710
Mom?!

22:01.580 --> 22:03.790
All systems
are functioning normally.

22:03.950 --> 22:07.420
Still, there's this fluctuation
in the containment field.

22:07.590 --> 22:12.030
- Can't account for it.
- Is this related to the planet?

22:12.190 --> 22:15.430
There is a beam of particles
emanating from it.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.170
But I cannot pinpoint the location.

22:18.330 --> 22:21.870
Captain,
there's a presence on the Enterprise.

22:23.770 --> 22:27.180
- An alien presence?
- No intruder on the sensors.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.010
There is a presence.

22:32.850 --> 22:36.050
Security, all decks yellow alert.
Possible intruder.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.200
- They said you were dead.
- There was a mistake.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.500
It's OK.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.410
But there was an explosion.
You were hurt.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.020
I'm fine.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.550
You mustn't think any more
about this.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.420
The important thing is
I'll never leave you again.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.430
I think somebody needs a hug.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.190
We have to go now.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.990
- Where?
- To the planet.

23:51.060 --> 23:55.860
- That's where we're going to live.
- Not on the Enterprise?

23:56.030 --> 23:57.670
No.

23:57.830 --> 24:01.670
We're gonna live in a home,
just like on Earth.

24:03.570 --> 24:07.980
You'll see. I promise.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.190
Lt Worf!

24:19.350 --> 24:22.520
It was a mistake. She didn't die.
She's alive!

24:22.690 --> 24:25.260
- Jeremy, come here!
- Lt Worf.

24:25.430 --> 24:28.400
It's alright. I'm here for the boy.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.700
- Lt Worf to Capt Picard.
- Go ahead.

24:33.870 --> 24:36.600
Lt Aster is in her quarters.

24:38.110 --> 24:41.080
- Repeat, Worf.
- Lt Aster is here.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.280
In her quarters with the boy.

24:44.450 --> 24:48.650
Do not provoke her or interfere
in any way. Picard out.

24:50.450 --> 24:52.620
Number One,
have Security move in that way

24:52.790 --> 24:55.490
but tell them to keep their distance.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.330
You have the bridge.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.830
Counselor.

25:04.200 --> 25:09.170
Don't worry. I'm going to take care
of Jeremy, make him happy.

25:10.370 --> 25:13.310
- It's time to go.
- Where are you taking the child?

25:13.480 --> 25:16.810
- To the planet.
- Come, Jeremy.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.420
Worf to Picard.
They're leaving their quarters.

25:30.690 --> 25:33.730
Captain, we're headed
for transporter room three.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.400
We're on our way.

25:42.070 --> 25:45.740
Chief O'Brien, Jeremy and I
are going to the surface.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.350
- Who are you?
- I'm Marla Aster.

25:59.790 --> 26:03.830
- It's my mother. She's alive.
- What do you want?

26:04.330 --> 26:09.330
- To take my child to the planet.
- I cannot permit that.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.270
I'm here to care for him.

26:12.430 --> 26:15.740
He needs me. Why do you resist?

26:15.900 --> 26:19.910
Because I don't know
who or what you are.

26:20.510 --> 26:22.280
Can't you see, Captain?

26:22.780 --> 26:25.980
She appears to be your mother
but she is not.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.750
- What?
- You're confusing him.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.290
Hey! Wait! Stop! No!

26:33.860 --> 26:36.290
No! Stop! Mom!

26:37.160 --> 26:43.870
Mom? Wait a minute. Let go of me.
She was right there.

26:49.140 --> 26:54.240
- What did you do to her?
- That was not your mother.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.210
You saw her. She was here.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.750
Your mother's dead.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.090
But I touched her. She was real.

27:05.420 --> 27:10.830
Why would your real mother take you
to a planet of dust and rocks?

27:28.140 --> 27:32.450
It's my house.
It's my house on Earth.

27:33.280 --> 27:37.050
Exactly the way it was.
Remember, Jeremy?

27:38.120 --> 27:42.660
- How did you do it?
- Does it matter?

27:42.820 --> 27:45.160
Yes, it matters.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.030
I am trying to understand
your resistance.

27:52.870 --> 27:56.300
You spoke of rocks and dust
on the planet.

27:56.470 --> 27:59.310
I decided to show you
what awaits us.

27:59.770 --> 28:02.340
Why would you create this fantasy?

28:04.180 --> 28:05.780
It's his home.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.450
It makes you happy, doesn't it?

28:09.620 --> 28:11.820
But it's not real.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.520
Isn't it?

28:14.720 --> 28:17.960
Jeremy,
isn't that really Patches?

28:30.110 --> 28:33.170
He knows me. It's him.

28:35.940 --> 28:39.780
- It's real. It's all real.
- No, it's not.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.750
Could your real mother
just make this appear?

28:45.220 --> 28:49.020
You must not stay here. Come with me.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.270
I can't.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.150
Is the boy in danger?

29:10.310 --> 29:14.520
I don't think so.
She seems to want to help him.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.420
By easing his pain.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.420
She's very confused
by our resistance, Captain.

29:20.420 --> 29:23.960
Troi, would it be wise
to remove Jeremy from his cabin?

29:24.790 --> 29:28.630
He doesn't want to leave.
I would not recommend using force.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.730
She offers him everything.
All we offer is his mother's death.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.470
What would you choose?

29:34.640 --> 29:38.570
If somebody offered to give you back
your mother, father, husband,

29:38.740 --> 29:41.180
would any of us say no so easily?

29:41.340 --> 29:44.080
Counselor, stay with them
in Jeremy's quarters.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.250
We'll try to end this from here.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.680
Understood.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.360
Data, can you determine
that the energy source

29:55.520 --> 29:57.530
is powering this creation?

29:58.660 --> 30:01.830
The beam from the planet
is tapping into us.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.530
I'd say they're running her
off our energy.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.040
So there are limits to her power.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.970
She needs the transporter
to get him back.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.610
How do we cut the puppet's strings?

30:12.770 --> 30:15.910
Match the shield's harmonics
to our containment fields.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.650
That should sever the beam.

30:17.910 --> 30:20.420
- Proceed.
- Deanna, stand by.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.550
Standing by.

30:25.220 --> 30:29.660
Jeremy,
it's time for this to end.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.000
It's not real, and it's over now.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.330
Jeremy, I'm not going
to leave you ever again.

30:38.830 --> 30:41.540
I won't trick you or lie.

30:42.940 --> 30:45.040
We'll be happy together...

30:49.640 --> 30:50.680
No...

31:12.330 --> 31:14.470
Antimatter pods reading nominal.

31:14.970 --> 31:17.440
The shield has severed the beam,
sir.

31:20.340 --> 31:21.580
Captain.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.410
The energy field...

31:28.080 --> 31:30.420
Mr Crusher, take us out.

31:42.730 --> 31:45.630
Alien intruder, transporter room
three! Security alert!

31:47.970 --> 31:52.310
- Security to transporter room three!
- Cmdr La Forge, Mr Worf, with me.

31:52.470 --> 31:54.110
Number One, you have the bridge.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.370
Come, Jeremy.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.840
We will not let them
separate us again.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.080
We're going home.

32:40.690 --> 32:44.430
Captain, she's trying
to take Jeremy off the ship.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.160
Acknowledged.

32:46.330 --> 32:49.360
Engineering, La Forge.
Shut down power to transporters.

32:49.530 --> 32:53.000
- I'm on my way.
- Aye-aye, sir.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.600
Lt Worf, to transporter room three.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.910
Bridge, seal off deck eight,
corridors A and B.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.250
Engaging force fields, Captain.

33:04.410 --> 33:05.980
Transporters down.

33:22.060 --> 33:25.470
Energy force has left transporter
room three. Security alert!

33:26.670 --> 33:29.640
La Forge, it may try
to reinstate transporters.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.170
Understood.

33:57.730 --> 34:01.500
Bridge,
release security force field 8B.

34:06.570 --> 34:08.179
Hello, Jeremy.

34:10.909 --> 34:13.580
How are you? Are you frightened?

34:14.580 --> 34:15.550
No.

34:18.050 --> 34:21.060
- Well, a little, sir.
- Of course.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.760
These are frightening things
that are happening.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.360
But we won't let anyone harm you.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.900
Counselor,
take the boy to my quarters.

34:31.730 --> 34:32.800
No!

34:45.510 --> 34:48.980
It's looking over everything,
Commander, going to school.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.690
Let's hope it doesn't blow us up

34:54.860 --> 34:58.030
while figuring out how to blow us up.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.970
Power's back
in transporter room three.

35:07.470 --> 35:11.010
Bypassing the manual override,
shutting it down.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.440
Transporter is down again.

35:14.610 --> 35:17.780
- Keep it down.
- Understood, Commander.

35:24.690 --> 35:29.760
It is only a matter of time before
we can power the transporters.

35:30.330 --> 35:33.230
We? For whom else do you speak?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.600
The accident on the surface
was caused

35:42.770 --> 35:46.410
by a remnant
of an ancient and tragic era.

35:47.710 --> 35:50.380
Two species once shared this world.

35:51.210 --> 35:54.450
One of energy and one of matter.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.450
The physical beings
you call Koinonians

35:58.590 --> 36:02.160
destroyed themselves
in unending, bitter wars.

36:02.590 --> 36:04.460
The surviving life forms

36:04.630 --> 36:06.900
will not tolerate
any further suffering

36:07.060 --> 36:09.730
as a result
of that dishonorable past.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.970
So... they have made this possible.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.600
They have made me possible.

36:17.470 --> 36:19.470
I appreciate your motives.

36:21.140 --> 36:24.150
But... his mother is dead.

36:24.980 --> 36:28.880
- He must live with that.
- I will be every bit his mother!

36:29.050 --> 36:30.790
But not his mother!

36:37.130 --> 36:40.530
- Picard to Lt Worf.
- Go ahead, Captain.

36:41.330 --> 36:45.070
Will you escort Ensign Crusher
to the Aster quarters?

36:45.230 --> 36:47.200
- Yes, sir.
- Picard out.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.670
Your philosophy is curious, Captain.

36:50.710 --> 36:53.210
What is so noble about sorrow?

36:53.740 --> 36:58.810
I can provide him an existence
where he will feel no anguish.

37:00.420 --> 37:05.450
It is at the heart of our nature
to feel pain... and joy.

37:06.250 --> 37:11.090
It is an essential part
of what makes us what we are.

37:12.860 --> 37:16.700
He is alone now in your world.
A child!

37:17.530 --> 37:18.900
Alone.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.940
How can you know
he won't be happier with me?

37:23.070 --> 37:26.610
For a brief moment in time,
he surely would be.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.610
Any of us in his place would be.

37:31.150 --> 37:33.550
What would Jeremy do for friends?

37:34.550 --> 37:36.580
He will have friends.

37:37.090 --> 37:40.660
And will you provide
for his education, his health,

37:40.820 --> 37:42.660
his growth,

37:42.820 --> 37:45.260
a career, a wife?

37:47.960 --> 37:51.330
Yes, it's quite an undertaking
you're proposing, isn't it?

37:53.270 --> 37:56.200
It is our duty to make him happy.

37:56.370 --> 37:59.810
Do you honestly believe
he would be happy in...

38:00.340 --> 38:04.650
...this total fiction
which you wish to create?

38:05.680 --> 38:08.220
What reason would he have to live?

38:08.380 --> 38:14.160
What you offer him is a memory,
something to cherish, not to live in.

38:15.020 --> 38:19.030
It is part of our life cycle that we
accept the death of those we love.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.530
Jeremy must come to terms
with his grief, not cover it.

38:25.170 --> 38:29.770
You see, we are mortal.
Our time in this universe is finite.

38:30.370 --> 38:34.580
That is one of the truths
that all humans must learn.

38:40.950 --> 38:43.420
Acting Ensign Crusher,
reporting as ordered.

38:43.590 --> 38:47.320
Come in, Wesley.
Please stay, Lieutenant.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.830
Wesley's father died
on a Starfleet mission...

39:00.140 --> 39:01.970
...when he was younger than you are.

39:04.310 --> 39:06.240
Wes, your mother told me

39:06.410 --> 39:11.410
you were finding it difficult
to talk to Jeremy. Why is that?

39:12.080 --> 39:13.850
I don't know.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.950
I don't want to think about it.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.490
All this has reminded me so much
of that day.

39:22.060 --> 39:26.460
The day I told you your father
had been killed. As I recall,

39:26.630 --> 39:28.360
you took it very well.

39:29.560 --> 39:33.570
My parents had told me
about Starfleet missions.

39:33.740 --> 39:36.670
- I knew what could happen.
- You were prepared?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.310
No. I wasn't prepared at all.

39:40.080 --> 39:45.010
How can anyone be prepared to hear
that a parent is never coming home?

39:46.210 --> 39:49.820
I tried to be
what everyone expected of me.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.990
Brave and mature.

39:53.090 --> 39:56.520
Wesley, are you saying
that you didn't want anybody

39:56.690 --> 39:58.790
to see what you were feeling?

40:01.400 --> 40:02.960
What were you feeling?

40:03.800 --> 40:06.800
Like...
somebody had kicked me in the head.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.800
Somebody?

40:10.470 --> 40:14.910
Go on. You've wanted to tell him
for a long time.

40:16.950 --> 40:19.810
I was angry... at you!

40:21.420 --> 40:24.120
Why were you angry at me, Wesley?

40:25.920 --> 40:30.090
Were you angry because I told you
your father was dead?

40:30.730 --> 40:33.030
- No.
- Then why?

40:34.530 --> 40:37.030
Because you led the mission.

40:37.700 --> 40:40.440
You came home and my father didn't.

40:43.670 --> 40:48.710
- How long were you angry, Wes?
- For a long time.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.880
But not any more, sir.

40:53.310 --> 40:55.220
Not even a little.

40:57.820 --> 41:03.490
So, Jeremy, you must be very angry
at Lieutenant Worf.

41:04.690 --> 41:09.000
He was in charge of your mother's
mission just like Capt Picard,

41:09.160 --> 41:13.740
when Wesley's father was killed.
Isn't that right?

41:14.770 --> 41:19.040
Worf came back. Your mother didn't.

41:20.680 --> 41:26.010
Why? Why weren't you the one who
died? Why did it have to be her?

41:26.510 --> 41:30.190
He can't answer that. None of us can.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.790
Lt Worf also lost his parents.

41:35.390 --> 41:42.800
They were killed when I was six.
When I was alone, humans helped me.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.100
Let me help you.

41:46.800 --> 41:51.010
The Marla Aster I knew and honored
is not in this room.

41:51.740 --> 41:54.240
Nor does she await you on the planet.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.780
She now only lives here...

41:58.980 --> 42:00.580
...and here.

42:08.920 --> 42:11.690
Join me in the R'uustai, the Bonding.

42:12.330 --> 42:15.860
You will become part of my family
for all time.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.630
We will be brothers.

44:04.340 --> 44:06.110
What does that mean?

44:08.510 --> 44:11.180
It honors the memory
of our mothers.

44:11.680 --> 44:15.350
We have bonded
and our families are stronger.
