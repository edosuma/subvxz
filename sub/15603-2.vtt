00:01.793 --> 00:03.465
<i>Previously, on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:03.490 --> 00:04.697
There's a conversation

00:04.698 --> 00:06.933
I've been hoping to have
with you for a while now,

00:06.934 --> 00:09.302
but I've never found
the right time to have it.

00:09.353 --> 00:11.321
We need to be
as honest as we can.

00:11.405 --> 00:13.857
It's the only way to make
this relationship work.

00:13.941 --> 00:15.025
You're a great friend,

00:15.109 --> 00:16.710
but I don't think
we should meet anymore.

00:16.744 --> 00:18.578
I love that
we've grown close again.

00:18.646 --> 00:20.831
You want to search someone's
hands for Jai's blood?

00:20.915 --> 00:22.115
Search yours.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.617
I had a meeting
with Henry Wilcox.

00:23.668 --> 00:25.752
I want to spare you
from the bloodletting

00:25.819 --> 00:26.819
about to hit Langley.

00:26.871 --> 00:28.255
Your security clearance

00:28.322 --> 00:30.290
will be dropped to a seven
until we filter the data.

00:30.341 --> 00:31.508
They requisitioned
your hard drive

00:31.592 --> 00:32.825
and downgraded
your security clearance.

00:32.877 --> 00:33.826
Henry called it.

00:33.878 --> 00:35.629
Your blood panel came back--

00:35.680 --> 00:37.430
no health issues.

00:37.498 --> 00:38.849
You're pregnant, Joan.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.767
Congratulations.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.936
- You're the Puma?
- My friends call me Teo.

00:43.003 --> 00:45.272
I suggest you two
leave Colombia.

00:45.339 --> 00:47.274
You don't want
to get lost in Medellin.

00:47.341 --> 00:49.976
The man you met, Teo--
he's Arthur's son.

00:50.027 --> 00:52.395
In the coming days,
press outlets will reveal

00:52.480 --> 00:56.366
that I have engaged
in an extramarital affair.

00:56.450 --> 00:59.286
I'm resigning my post,
effective immediately.

02:04.135 --> 02:06.269
Since when did you start
carrying on U.S. soil?

02:06.354 --> 02:09.773
Since the last time
someone broke into my kitchen.

02:12.476 --> 02:14.060
How'd you get in here?
Don't worry.

02:14.111 --> 02:15.979
I lost whatever press
was tailing me.

02:16.063 --> 02:17.743
Last thing I need right now
is to be caught

02:17.782 --> 02:19.702
having an illicit meeting
with some young blonde.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.402
Is that supposed
to be a joke?

02:22.453 --> 02:24.103
How could you do this to Joan?

02:24.155 --> 02:27.791
You don't get
to ask questions yet.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.243
We were investigating
transfer of funds

02:30.294 --> 02:34.381
from your personal account
to the Puma--a known terrorist.

02:34.448 --> 02:37.500
Henry Wilcox
gave this to you?

02:37.585 --> 02:39.786
Is, uh, this
the woman you, uh...?

02:39.837 --> 02:42.088
That I resigned over?
No, this is Teresa Hamilton.

02:42.139 --> 02:44.424
She's a cutout for the Puma.

02:44.475 --> 02:46.259
Arthur, I know
Teo is your son.

02:48.396 --> 02:51.314
What's going on here?

02:56.437 --> 02:58.822
I had no business
having a kid.

02:58.906 --> 03:00.807
I was still
basically one myself--

03:00.858 --> 03:04.611
just out of Annapolis,
my first overseas tour.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.617
And Teo's mom...

03:21.462 --> 03:24.514
her name was Ana...

03:24.598 --> 03:26.516
Ana Sofia.

03:28.302 --> 03:30.020
I didn't learn
she was pregnant

03:30.104 --> 03:34.274
until I was out
in the middle of the Pacific.

03:34.341 --> 03:36.059
If I had to do it
all over again,

03:36.143 --> 03:38.695
I would have proposed to her
right then and there

03:38.779 --> 03:41.531
and begged her to come join me
as soon as she could.

03:41.615 --> 03:45.902
But I was young and scared.

03:49.657 --> 03:51.023
So what happened?

03:51.075 --> 03:52.325
She had the baby.

03:52.376 --> 03:54.411
Her parents
became a huge obstacle.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.195
They refused
to let her marry me.

03:56.247 --> 03:58.214
They made it very difficult
for me to see my son.

03:58.299 --> 04:01.167
But, uh--
but we still managed

04:01.218 --> 04:04.504
to steal a few moments
here and there.

04:06.507 --> 04:10.060
And where's Ana Sofia now?

04:10.144 --> 04:12.378
She died.

04:14.398 --> 04:16.149
Her parents took Teo in,

04:16.216 --> 04:18.017
cut me off
from him completely.

04:18.069 --> 04:19.589
It wasn't until
they passed years later

04:19.603 --> 04:21.387
that Teo and I
were able to reconnect.

04:21.439 --> 04:23.323
And that hasn't been easy.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.892
You know, I suppose
I tried too hard

04:25.943 --> 04:28.227
to make it all up to him.

04:28.279 --> 04:30.280
There's a part of him
that keeps--

04:30.364 --> 04:32.832
that keeps pushing me away.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.735
But lately...

04:35.786 --> 04:37.003
he's become erratic.

04:37.070 --> 04:41.007
That's accurate,
with what I saw.

04:41.074 --> 04:42.792
Does Joan know about Teo?

04:42.877 --> 04:44.761
No.

04:44.845 --> 04:46.713
Why not?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.581
Joan and I had challenges
trying to start a family,

04:48.632 --> 04:51.083
and I suppose I was...

04:51.135 --> 04:54.086
You know,
I was afraid of admitting...

04:54.138 --> 04:57.857
just how much being
a father meant to me.

04:57.925 --> 05:01.060
Does Henry know Teo's my son?
He hasn't said anything to me.

05:01.112 --> 05:03.229
If he does know,
he'll do everything in his power

05:03.280 --> 05:05.198
to exploit it...

05:05.265 --> 05:06.699
to ruin me.

05:06.767 --> 05:08.768
He's gonna want to hear
what I found out in Colombia.

05:08.819 --> 05:11.538
I can try and see if he knows
the truth about Teo.

05:11.605 --> 05:13.373
Well, you can't ask him
directly.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.458
He'll have to volunteer it.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.544
What if he doesn't?

05:19.446 --> 05:21.414
Confirm everything else.

05:21.465 --> 05:23.166
Tell him
I am funding the Puma.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.250
What?

05:24.301 --> 05:26.052
Earn some trust,
some goodwill,

05:26.119 --> 05:28.254
and we'll see what he does
with the information.

05:28.305 --> 05:29.672
Henry always finds a way

05:29.757 --> 05:32.625
to profit
from other people's problems.

05:32.676 --> 05:35.962
How soon could you
arrange a meet?

05:47.992 --> 05:50.076
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

05:50.143 --> 05:51.644
You said it was important.

05:51.695 --> 05:54.247
Well, I just got back
from Colombia.

05:54.314 --> 05:55.999
You verify the intel
in the file?

05:56.083 --> 05:57.500
The truth is even
more damning.

05:57.585 --> 06:00.837
The funds are being funneled
directly to Teo Braga.

06:00.921 --> 06:02.338
The Puma.

06:02.423 --> 06:04.123
What about the woman
in the photos?

06:04.175 --> 06:05.291
Got any I.D.?

06:05.342 --> 06:07.760
She's a cutout,
like you said.

06:07.828 --> 06:12.265
Arthur said her name
was Teresa Hamilton.

06:12.332 --> 06:14.551
I can't figure out
his play here.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.219
I've never had any success

06:16.303 --> 06:18.438
trying to discern
Arthur's motives.

06:18.505 --> 06:20.023
Were you able to discover

06:20.107 --> 06:23.276
the extent of Arthur's
relationship with Teo Braga?

06:26.530 --> 06:28.481
No.

06:30.534 --> 06:32.535
Well, then...

06:32.620 --> 06:34.353
Thank you for sharing.

06:34.405 --> 06:36.039
Wait.
That's it?

06:36.123 --> 06:37.857
Well, I'm sorry.

06:37.908 --> 06:40.910
You asked for the meeting.
I thought we were through.

06:40.995 --> 06:44.297
Well, what's the next thing
you want me to do?

06:44.364 --> 06:45.832
I mean, when I said I was in,
I meant it.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.134
I think you misunderstood
our last meeting.

06:48.201 --> 06:51.838
I wasn't asking you to do
anything with the file.

06:51.889 --> 06:55.225
I was simply, uh, extending
a professional courtesy.

06:55.309 --> 06:56.559
Right.
And I appreciate that.

06:56.644 --> 06:59.045
Then why'd you already
read somebody else in?

07:01.098 --> 07:04.350
You brought your boyfriend
down to Colombia.

07:06.103 --> 07:08.154
I brought my handler
to Colombia, yes.

07:08.221 --> 07:10.389
I felt I owed it to Auggie.

07:10.441 --> 07:11.441
You owed him?

07:11.525 --> 07:13.526
He's implicated
in that file.

07:13.577 --> 07:17.280
His security clearance got
dinged, just like you said.

07:17.364 --> 07:19.699
Now, Arthur...

07:19.750 --> 07:24.370
How did you know
that was gonna happen?

07:24.421 --> 07:27.373
I expected more from you.

07:37.268 --> 07:39.469
What happened?

07:39.553 --> 07:41.778
Our fish has taken the bait.

07:44.258 --> 07:48.258

for www.addic7ed.com

07:58.865 --> 07:59.863
Where are you?

07:59.873 --> 08:02.583
We were supposed to talk to Joan
this morning about Colombia.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.001
I need you to run a trace

08:04.085 --> 08:06.003
on the pay phone
on 14th and Pennsylvania.

08:06.087 --> 08:07.554
A pay phone?

08:07.622 --> 08:10.290
I swear, sometimes
I am convinced

08:10.341 --> 08:12.142
the phone company
keeps them around for spies.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.011
It was an outgoing call
two minutes ago

08:14.095 --> 08:16.463
and an incoming one just now.

08:16.514 --> 08:18.131
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

08:18.183 --> 08:19.733
I'm trailing Henry Wilcox.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.019
What?
Why?

08:22.103 --> 08:24.104
To see what he does
with the intel I gave him.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.472
I'm sorry.

08:25.523 --> 08:28.242
What intel that you got
from where to accomplish what?

08:28.309 --> 08:30.360
Arthur came to see me
last night.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.145
He confessed to everything.
Everything?

08:32.197 --> 08:34.331
What does that mean?
To being Teo's father...

08:34.414 --> 08:36.416
to keeping it from Joan.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.034
Joan really doesn't know?

08:38.119 --> 08:40.621
Promise me you won't tell her.
It's got to come from Arthur.

08:40.672 --> 08:42.989
- Yeah, fine.
- Okay, I got to go.

08:43.041 --> 08:46.326
Give me a call when you get
a trace on that phone.

09:34.926 --> 09:37.311
Hey.

09:37.378 --> 09:38.845
This a bad time?

09:38.897 --> 09:42.549
Uh, it's not exactly
a good one.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.351
You know,
I spent the last hour

09:44.402 --> 09:46.720
mulling over the appropriateness
of dropping by like this

09:46.771 --> 09:49.656
given everything, but I wouldn't
be able to live with myself

09:49.724 --> 09:54.060
if I didn't come down
to offer you my support, so...

09:54.112 --> 09:56.062
Yeah.

09:56.114 --> 09:59.082
Wow. I have never seen you
this awkward before.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.234
Well, like I said,
I just want you to know

10:01.286 --> 10:02.569
that I'm here for you.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.338
Thank you.

10:04.405 --> 10:06.957
Everybody up in legal
was completely blindsided

10:07.041 --> 10:08.761
by Arthur's resignation--
I mean, everybody.

10:08.793 --> 10:10.076
It's like it came
out of nowhere.

10:10.128 --> 10:12.012
Well, it came
as a surprise to me too.

10:12.079 --> 10:16.683
Sorry. I can't comprehend
how painful this must be.

10:18.186 --> 10:20.587
If you want to grab dinner
this week--

10:20.638 --> 10:22.255
nothing serious,
just a--

10:22.307 --> 10:24.274
you know, an hour or two
with a friend.

10:24.359 --> 10:26.926
There's a Yucatan place
that just opened

10:26.978 --> 10:30.314
over in Adams Morgan.

10:30.398 --> 10:32.733
I just crossed the line
to inappropriate, didn't I?

10:32.784 --> 10:34.151
I appreciate the offer.

10:34.235 --> 10:37.437
I really do, but I've just got
a little bit too much

10:37.488 --> 10:38.605
on my plate right now.

10:38.656 --> 10:39.873
I understand.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.609
The door's always open
if you change your mind.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.795
Thank you.

10:54.973 --> 10:56.723
Finished running the trace
on the pay phone Henry used.

10:56.791 --> 10:58.124
Anything yet?

10:58.176 --> 11:01.228
A call was placed
to Langley's main switchboard.

11:01.295 --> 11:02.813
No wonder
he used a pay phone.

11:02.897 --> 11:04.848
Could you trace which extension
he was connected to?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.183
No, it gets rerouted
after that.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.234
And the incoming?

11:07.301 --> 11:08.685
Burner phone,
paid for with cash

11:08.770 --> 11:10.771
at a vending machine
at the Frankfurt airport.

11:10.822 --> 11:12.406
- In other words...
- Untraceable.

11:12.473 --> 11:14.691
Hey, why do I hear an echo?

11:14.776 --> 11:16.443
I'm in the Metro station
at the federal triangle.

11:16.494 --> 11:18.978
Annie, that is 29 different
kinds of ill-advised.

11:19.030 --> 11:21.198
If he spots you,
you can't walk this back.

11:21.282 --> 11:22.282
This is my train.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.751
I'll call you
as soon as I can.

12:03.574 --> 12:05.358
Hey, Auggie,
do you have a second?

12:05.410 --> 12:07.627
Yeah, of course.
Do you want to sit down?

12:07.695 --> 12:09.663
No, I-I really
only need a second.

12:09.714 --> 12:12.499
I haven't seen you
since, uh...

12:12.550 --> 12:14.000
How you doing?

12:14.052 --> 12:15.719
Why is everyone acting
so odd around me?

12:15.803 --> 12:18.638
You're all walking on eggshells.
I'm not that fragile.

12:18.706 --> 12:19.723
I know.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.925
I'm sorry, Joan.
I just, uh...

12:22.009 --> 12:24.377
Look, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

12:24.429 --> 12:25.846
Good,
'cause that's what I need.

12:25.897 --> 12:28.565
I'm in a bit
of an awkward situation here.

12:28.649 --> 12:31.818
Normally in the wake

12:31.886 --> 12:34.354
of discovering
a CIA officer's affair,

12:34.405 --> 12:38.024
I'd be tasked with investigating
any possible security breach.

12:38.076 --> 12:40.026
However, because
that officer is Arthur--

12:40.078 --> 12:41.745
You had to recuse yourself.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.581
There was concern
I'd get too emotional.

12:44.665 --> 12:46.750
Well, no one could hold that
against you.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.235
Arthur's refused
to divulge his mistress's name

12:49.287 --> 12:50.620
on the grounds she's covert.

12:50.705 --> 12:53.239
Now, I don't want
to burn anyone's cover

12:53.291 --> 12:55.675
or undermine
this investigation,

12:55.743 --> 12:57.878
but I'd like to rule out
any possibility

12:57.929 --> 13:01.548
that Arthur might have been...

13:01.599 --> 13:02.916
for lack of a better word,

13:02.967 --> 13:06.103
sloppy during his assignations,
for personal reasons.

13:06.187 --> 13:08.722
I understand.

13:08.773 --> 13:11.391
There was a night recently,
we were out to dinner.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.976
Arthur stepped away
to take a call.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.978
I didn't think much of it
in the moment,

13:15.062 --> 13:16.930
but in retrospect,
I'm quite certain

13:16.981 --> 13:18.598
that I saw
a second cell phone on him.

13:18.649 --> 13:20.433
- You want me to look into it?
- Would you?

13:20.485 --> 13:23.403
Off the record, of course.
Of course.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.906
We were at the Atlas Room.
It was Thursday night.

13:25.957 --> 13:29.275
Call came in 8:40, 8:45,
roughly.

13:29.327 --> 13:32.245
- I'll get right on it.
- Great.

13:32.296 --> 13:35.165
- Thank you, Auggie.
- Yeah.

15:24.777 --> 15:27.046
- You getting off or not?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:41.627 --> 15:42.845
I'm sorry.

15:42.929 --> 15:45.230
One second, please.
No problem.

15:51.821 --> 15:54.023
Medellin
needs 15 more minutes.

15:54.107 --> 15:56.408
When they're ready, I'll patch
them in on the Polycom.

15:56.476 --> 15:57.910
Solstar's
a regional heavyweight

15:57.977 --> 15:59.411
in the energy-services
business--

15:59.479 --> 16:01.080
big footprint in Colombia.

16:01.147 --> 16:03.032
They're pumping close
to 300,000 barrels a day

16:03.116 --> 16:04.416
out of their field
in Casanare,

16:04.484 --> 16:06.452
or, to be more specific,
they were pumping that much

16:06.503 --> 16:07.836
until about two weeks ago.

16:07.921 --> 16:09.838
The Ayacucho pipeline
bombing.

16:09.923 --> 16:13.926
Uhhuh, courtesy of our
friends Teo Braga and the A.L.C.

16:13.993 --> 16:16.295
It doesn't feel
like a coincidence.

16:16.346 --> 16:17.679
No, it doesn't.

16:17.764 --> 16:19.431
It sure would be nice to hear

16:19.499 --> 16:21.767
what they're saying in there,
wouldn't it?

16:21.834 --> 16:23.185
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

16:23.269 --> 16:25.604
Hey, do you have access
to the central office switches?

16:27.673 --> 16:30.776
I do now.

16:30.843 --> 16:32.523
I haven't done taps
since the farm, though.

16:32.529 --> 16:33.845
Oh, it's like riding a bike,

16:33.897 --> 16:35.564
only the bike isn't breaking
the fourth amendment.

16:35.648 --> 16:37.282
All right,
what you want to create

16:37.350 --> 16:39.068
is a slave parallel wiretap.

16:39.152 --> 16:40.652
You'll need
Solstar's target line.

16:40.703 --> 16:42.223
They should be grouped
by floor number.

16:42.238 --> 16:43.688
Okay, got it.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.575
You'll need an unused line you
can pirate to eavesdrop from.

16:46.659 --> 16:47.960
You're listening
for a dial tone.

16:48.027 --> 16:49.461
That's your parallel.

16:49.529 --> 16:51.046
Now you need
to create your slave.

16:51.131 --> 16:52.381
Uh, I'm one wire short,
though.

16:52.465 --> 16:54.917
Uhhuh.
Hey, what about your headset?

16:55.001 --> 16:58.370
Do you have wire cutters?
No, but I got teeth.

16:58.421 --> 17:00.806
Well, that'll do the trick.

17:00.873 --> 17:02.841
Signing off.

17:09.048 --> 17:12.651
No, that's
two separate bouquets going to--

17:12.718 --> 17:14.103
Why would I throw in
Fernandez?

17:14.186 --> 17:17.906
Fernandez would be starting
on any other team in the league.

17:17.991 --> 17:19.723
My guy inside fudra--

17:19.776 --> 17:21.443
he says they've got things
under control.

17:21.528 --> 17:23.444
- Your guy's lying to you.
- Bingo.

17:23.530 --> 17:25.730
Things aren't under control.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.751
The CIA's been
secretly financing

17:29.836 --> 17:31.203
the A.L.C. under the table.

17:31.254 --> 17:33.088
It's why Arthur Campbell
had to step down.

17:33.173 --> 17:35.207
He has a personal connection
to Teo Braga.

17:35.258 --> 17:37.426
Teo Braga?
What kind of connection?

17:37.510 --> 17:38.927
I'm afraid
that's classified.

17:39.012 --> 17:43.549
But believe me, it's a bond
that cannot easily be severed.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.417
He knows.

17:45.468 --> 17:47.803
He knows Teo's identity.
He knows he's my son.

17:47.887 --> 17:49.388
I'm sorry, Arthur.

17:49.439 --> 17:51.974
- I need to confront him.
- Disagree.

17:52.058 --> 17:53.142
We work the intel.

17:53.226 --> 17:55.093
We still have a potential
mole to uncover.

17:55.145 --> 17:57.596
This affects the entire Agency,
not just you.

17:57.647 --> 17:59.615
Play it again.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.200
We have a handle
on the Solstar execs.

18:01.267 --> 18:03.202
It's the other voice
that we can't place.

18:06.623 --> 18:09.374
We know Henry's in contact
with someone in the building,

18:09.442 --> 18:10.492
and this guy says "we."

18:10.577 --> 18:13.245
My guess is he's one of ours.

18:13.296 --> 18:14.546
Do you recognize his voice?

18:14.614 --> 18:16.165
Well, Henry's voice
is overriding it.

18:16.249 --> 18:17.583
The sound quality's not great.

18:17.634 --> 18:21.587
Hey, Annie put a lot
on the line to get that for you.

18:21.638 --> 18:24.956
Let's hear it again.

18:27.810 --> 18:29.678
CIA is...

18:29.762 --> 18:31.263
No.

18:31.314 --> 18:32.681
I can't identify him.

18:32.765 --> 18:34.132
Do you think it could be
someone from the Latin desk

18:34.184 --> 18:35.634
or one of your ex-lieutenants?

18:35.685 --> 18:37.519
- I don't know.
- Play it for him again.

18:37.604 --> 18:38.570
I don't know who it is.

18:38.638 --> 18:39.878
Great.
Thanks for all your help.

18:39.939 --> 18:41.306
Auggie.

18:41.357 --> 18:42.807
No, we need to take this
to Joan right now, tonight.

18:42.859 --> 18:44.693
You can't do that...

18:44.777 --> 18:46.411
Not yet.
Why not?

18:46.479 --> 18:48.813
Is it because you don't want her
to know the truth about Teo?

18:48.865 --> 18:50.982
Or is it because
you don't want her to find out

18:51.034 --> 18:53.652
about this phony affair
of yours?

18:53.703 --> 18:56.672
I grabbed your backup burner
phone number

18:56.756 --> 18:59.374
from a cell tower
in the near northeast--

18:59.459 --> 19:00.709
secret email account, too.

19:00.793 --> 19:03.795
You know what I found?
Nothing.

19:03.846 --> 19:05.047
No secret messages.

19:05.131 --> 19:07.049
No late-night booty calls.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.550
You say she's
a covert operative,

19:08.635 --> 19:11.670
so I find it highly unlikely
she's threatening to go public.

19:11.721 --> 19:14.389
Now, you could have resigned
quietly for personal reasons.

19:14.474 --> 19:15.857
No one would have been
the wiser,

19:15.942 --> 19:19.945
but you needed a diversion
to take the scent off Teo.

19:22.148 --> 19:24.983
Bravo, you figured it out.

19:25.034 --> 19:28.620
Look at the big brain on you.

19:28.688 --> 19:31.073
Joan thinks you really
cheated on her, Arthur.

19:31.157 --> 19:33.242
I'm trying to protect her.

19:33.326 --> 19:35.661
Lying to her was the hardest
thing I ever had to do,

19:35.712 --> 19:37.412
but let there be no doubt--
I had to do it.

19:37.497 --> 19:38.964
Well, your story
won't hold up.

19:39.031 --> 19:41.083
I'm not gonna be
the last one looking into it.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.918
It doesn't have
to hold up forever--

19:43.002 --> 19:46.588
just through tomorrow.
- What's tomorrow?

19:46.673 --> 19:49.558
There is a chance that Joan
emerges from this unscathed,

19:49.642 --> 19:52.544
but she's gonna need more
than plausible deniability.

19:52.595 --> 19:55.430
She needs to be unassailable.

19:55.515 --> 19:57.266
Otherwise,
she'll go down with me,

19:57.350 --> 19:59.151
and they'll remove her
from the building.

19:59.218 --> 20:02.387
She has to pass a polygraph.

20:02.438 --> 20:04.323
That's the reason
you kept all this from her.

20:04.390 --> 20:05.941
The poly's scheduled
for tomorrow.

20:06.025 --> 20:08.226
I need you both
not to say anything to her

20:08.278 --> 20:09.361
until afterwards.

20:09.412 --> 20:11.997
Thanks for asking.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.916
Of course
we won't say anything.

20:16.402 --> 20:19.621
But you underestimate her,
Arthur.

20:19.706 --> 20:21.173
You underestimate us all.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.074
I'm just trying
to make things right.

20:23.126 --> 20:26.077
Well, it's a little late
for that.

20:26.129 --> 20:27.679
So you've never had
a relationship

20:27.747 --> 20:29.080
with someone
you worked with...

20:29.132 --> 20:31.266
A relationship
that challenged your standards

20:31.351 --> 20:34.219
of honesty and intimacy?

20:34.270 --> 20:36.471
Maybe we should call it
a night.

20:36.556 --> 20:38.974
I think
that's a good idea.

20:40.810 --> 20:43.428
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Of course.

20:43.479 --> 20:45.947
It's just right there.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.204
You better check
that attitude of yours.

20:52.271 --> 20:54.439
You need to stop playing
on Annie's sympathy for you.

20:54.490 --> 20:56.625
If you needed somebody to go
toe-to-toe with Henry,

20:56.709 --> 20:58.777
you should have come to me
and left her out of it.

20:58.828 --> 21:00.945
She was already in it.

21:00.997 --> 21:02.447
Henry made sure of that.

21:02.498 --> 21:04.449
No, this is all on you.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.084
Oh, so you're
gonna keep score?

21:06.135 --> 21:07.803
Who let her go to Colombia?

21:07.887 --> 21:10.121
Which one of us read her in
on Teo's identity?

21:10.173 --> 21:12.624
I told you she was gonna
figure it out on her own.

21:12.675 --> 21:15.227
And I think it's a mistake
not to read her in entirely.

21:15.294 --> 21:18.146
I know it's a burden
to keep secrets from her.

21:18.231 --> 21:20.098
From my vantage point,

21:20.149 --> 21:22.300
it looks like you want her
to find everything out

21:22.352 --> 21:26.471
so you don't have to carry
the weight.

21:26.522 --> 21:28.857
Sack up.

21:31.911 --> 21:34.145
You ready?

21:47.994 --> 21:49.494
Are you upset with me?

21:49.579 --> 21:52.414
No.
Why would you say that?

21:52.481 --> 21:54.950
The way you went
after Arthur back there--

21:55.001 --> 21:57.085
it was out of character.

21:57.153 --> 21:59.755
I didn't know if maybe
you were mad at him

21:59.822 --> 22:02.758
for sending me
after Henry or not.

22:02.825 --> 22:04.376
No.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.962
That is Arthur...

22:07.013 --> 22:07.963
not you.

22:08.014 --> 22:10.515
But it was my decision.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.601
I'm a big girl.

22:14.503 --> 22:17.505
I just don't like being put in
a position where I have to lie.

22:17.557 --> 22:18.940
To Joan?

22:19.008 --> 22:22.110
- To Joan, to whomever.
- Mm.

22:22.178 --> 22:24.696
I'm not gonna
actively deceive her.

22:24.781 --> 22:26.281
I won't volunteer anything,

22:26.348 --> 22:29.117
but if she asks me
what I know about Arthur,

22:29.185 --> 22:31.536
I'm not gonna lie.

22:37.910 --> 22:41.380
You know, before we started...

22:41.464 --> 22:43.799
This...

22:43.866 --> 22:45.717
I would have shrugged off
you spying on Henry

22:45.802 --> 22:48.053
without consulting me first.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.390
It is how you roll,
and it is one of the many things

22:51.474 --> 22:52.891
I like about you.

22:55.845 --> 22:59.481
But I feel differently today.

23:03.519 --> 23:05.487
You are upset with me.

23:05.554 --> 23:08.490
Not upset...

23:10.493 --> 23:12.778
just a little sad...

23:12.862 --> 23:15.747
That we have to make
these kinds of compromises.

23:18.334 --> 23:21.002
That comes
with the territory.

23:22.872 --> 23:25.590
We're not them.

23:25.675 --> 23:28.593
We don't have to fall
into those traps.

23:37.753 --> 23:39.921
We appreciate your counsel
here today, Henry,

23:39.972 --> 23:43.525
but I just can't justify
the extra outlay to my board,

23:43.592 --> 23:45.393
not for another
security contract.

23:45.445 --> 23:47.729
I think you're making
a grave mistake, Roger,

23:47.780 --> 23:49.264
but if the timing's
not right--

23:49.315 --> 23:51.483
- Thank you, Henry.
- <i>Buenas tardes.</i>

23:51.567 --> 23:53.452
- <i>Buenas tardes.</i>
- <i>Adios.</i>

23:53.536 --> 23:54.736
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.738
I, uh, know it's only
been 24 hours,

23:56.789 --> 23:58.240
but were you able
to pull anything

23:58.291 --> 24:01.576
from that detail I gave you--
a name, a number?

24:03.463 --> 24:04.880
They're ready for you
down in polygraph.

24:04.947 --> 24:07.048
Okay, tell them
I'll be there in five.

24:08.634 --> 24:10.552
So were you able
to find anything?

24:10.619 --> 24:12.120
No.

24:12.171 --> 24:14.256
Nothing yet.

24:14.307 --> 24:16.007
That's disappointing.

24:16.092 --> 24:17.458
I can keep looking
if you like.

24:17.510 --> 24:19.094
Would you, please?

24:20.680 --> 24:23.648
Oh, um, Auggie...

24:23.733 --> 24:25.267
One day you and I
are gonna discuss

24:25.318 --> 24:27.402
what you were doing
with Annie down in Colombia

24:27.469 --> 24:30.655
and why you've been acting
so strangely since you got back.

24:48.157 --> 24:50.542
Oh, I didn't realize
anyone would...

24:50.626 --> 24:51.676
Be here.

24:51.761 --> 24:53.879
It's okay.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.218
Joan, are you okay?

25:05.141 --> 25:07.225
This is, uh...

25:09.478 --> 25:12.480
kind of embarrassing.

25:12.532 --> 25:17.068
Life sure comes at you
in funny ways sometimes.

25:25.962 --> 25:27.712
Joan, are you pregnant?

25:33.586 --> 25:36.671
Just one more thing
I didn't see coming.

25:38.090 --> 25:40.225
So much for woman's intuition.

25:40.309 --> 25:42.377
How are you feeling?
Are you okay?

25:42.428 --> 25:44.312
Besides discovering
the father of my child

25:44.380 --> 25:47.232
is cheating on me,
I'm great.

25:47.316 --> 25:50.068
Joan, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something--

25:50.152 --> 25:52.854
Annie, I am late
for a polygraph.

25:52.905 --> 25:55.907
Can this wait?
Yeah.

25:55.992 --> 25:58.243
Okay.

26:00.279 --> 26:04.115
Arthur doesn't know
about any of this yet,

26:04.200 --> 26:06.918
so if you could...
Of course.

26:07.003 --> 26:08.870
Thank you.

26:08.921 --> 26:13.408
Polygraph number 447-b,
Joan Campbell.

26:13.459 --> 26:16.461
According to your statement, you
didn't learn about the affair

26:16.545 --> 26:18.597
until the night
before Mr. Campbell resigned.

26:18.681 --> 26:20.015
Yes, that's right.

26:20.082 --> 26:21.766
Did he tell you
who the infidelities were with?

26:21.851 --> 26:23.351
No.

26:23.419 --> 26:25.379
And you were unable
to pick up any nonverbal cues,

26:25.421 --> 26:28.256
any changes in body language
or the tenor of his voice?

26:28.307 --> 26:31.192
This is my husband we're
talking about, not a rival spy.

26:31.260 --> 26:32.277
Are you aware of anything

26:32.361 --> 26:34.145
Arthur would have wanted
to cover up--

26:34.230 --> 26:35.647
any misappropriation of funds,

26:35.731 --> 26:38.450
any unauthorized operations?
No.

26:38.534 --> 26:40.535
When was the last time
you were intimate physically

26:40.602 --> 26:42.871
with your husband?

26:46.459 --> 26:49.327
We're talking about a culture
that abhors surprises,

26:49.412 --> 26:51.046
and what I'm hearing
from my sources

26:51.113 --> 26:53.748
is that nobody inside Langley
saw this coming at all,

26:53.799 --> 26:55.917
not from a lifer
like Arthur Campbell.

26:55.968 --> 26:57.886
Right now there is no shortage
of speculation

26:57.953 --> 26:59.421
as to what really motivated

26:59.472 --> 27:01.306
the Director
of Clandestine Services

27:01.390 --> 27:02.924
to step down so suddenly.

27:10.650 --> 27:13.634
I spent my lunch hour
casing out Solstar.

27:13.686 --> 27:16.471
Chatted up a receptionist
having a smoke.

27:16.522 --> 27:18.473
I didn't glean anything about
who else was in that meeting,

27:18.524 --> 27:21.976
but I did find out Salazar
is headed to Colombia this week

27:22.028 --> 27:23.411
for an executive retreat.

27:23.479 --> 27:24.746
How about you?

27:24.813 --> 27:26.364
I sampled the voice
from that teleconference,

27:26.449 --> 27:28.667
ran it through
a voice-recognition database,

27:28.751 --> 27:31.119
but I came up with nothing--
the quality's too iffy.

27:31.170 --> 27:32.653
So we know what?
He's a he?

27:32.705 --> 27:35.674
And that he can say
"good afternoon" in Spanish.

27:35.758 --> 27:37.658
That doesn't drain
the pool very much.

27:37.710 --> 27:39.678
We have to keep drilling down.

27:39.762 --> 27:41.846
Yeah, unfortunately
it's gonna have to wait

27:41.931 --> 27:44.999
till after the NFAC run-through.
Ugh.

27:45.051 --> 27:46.501
You know,
if we sit near the door,

27:46.552 --> 27:48.720
maybe we can sneak out during
the powerpoint presentation.

27:48.804 --> 27:50.338
Hey.

27:50.389 --> 27:52.023
Hey to you too.

27:52.108 --> 27:54.059
I'm not stalking you,
in case you were worried.

27:54.143 --> 27:57.228
I wasn't even thinking that
until you just said it.

27:57.313 --> 28:00.014
Uh, listen. You can't say
that you got this from me...

28:00.066 --> 28:01.147
- Mm-hmm.
- But I just heard

28:01.183 --> 28:02.901
that you aced your poly.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.853
- You heard that already?
- Yeah.

28:05.905 --> 28:08.823
Uh, DCI wanted
the results immediately.

28:08.874 --> 28:10.709
Rumor has it
he's banging the drum

28:10.793 --> 28:13.161
to have you replace
Arthur as DCS.

28:13.212 --> 28:14.829
- What?
- Yeah.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.665
That felt like a witch hunt,
not a job interview.

28:17.717 --> 28:19.551
Well, I'm sorry
to jump the gun like this,

28:19.635 --> 28:21.720
but I just figured
you could use a pick-me-up.

28:21.804 --> 28:24.172
- Well, thank you.
- No problem.

28:24.223 --> 28:27.559
Is that invitation for dinner
still open tonight?

28:27.643 --> 28:30.011
Well, what do you think?

28:30.062 --> 28:32.063
I have to run home first
to do an errand,

28:32.148 --> 28:33.681
- but you can pick me up at 8:00.
- Great.

28:33.733 --> 28:35.350
Well, I hope you're hungry.

28:35.401 --> 28:36.985
The place is called
Casa Nosotros,

28:37.052 --> 28:39.387
and the Cochinita Pibil
is amazing.

28:39.438 --> 28:41.722
Okay. See you tonight.

28:41.774 --> 28:44.242
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

28:52.418 --> 28:53.868
Seth Newman?

28:53.919 --> 28:55.370
We think he's who gave Henry

28:55.421 --> 28:57.288
the details
of your bank transfers.

28:57.373 --> 28:59.507
Does he have access
to that kind of information?

28:59.575 --> 29:02.043
Not directly, no, but if
he was motivated enough, sure.

29:02.094 --> 29:03.744
Well, you stole Joan
from him, didn't you?

29:03.796 --> 29:05.964
We were both in relationships
at the same time.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.748
It's tough to say
who stole who.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.717
All right, let's just say
he was properly motivated.

29:09.769 --> 29:12.020
What do we do about it now?

29:12.087 --> 29:13.921
Nothing.

29:13.973 --> 29:15.256
Nothing?

29:15.307 --> 29:16.591
At least not openly.

29:16.642 --> 29:18.593
We can't accuse him
without something concrete.

29:18.644 --> 29:20.528
If we confront him,
it'll only expose you to Henry.

29:20.596 --> 29:21.813
I want to search his house,

29:21.897 --> 29:23.231
see if there's a safe
that I can get into

29:23.282 --> 29:25.150
or a burner phone
I can pull the digits off of.

29:25.234 --> 29:26.284
Too risky.

29:26.368 --> 29:27.819
He's single.
He lives alone.

29:27.903 --> 29:31.272
We know he won't be home until
at least 9:00 or 10:00 tonight.

29:31.323 --> 29:32.740
Well, how do you know that?

29:32.792 --> 29:34.576
Because Seth's having dinner
with Joan.

29:34.627 --> 29:36.944
I think they said tacos.

29:36.996 --> 29:39.080
- What are you doing?
- Trying to reach her.

29:39.131 --> 29:41.549
No, if you tell Joan now,
we lose our window.

29:41.617 --> 29:45.086
Olivia, is Joan available?

29:45.137 --> 29:47.338
Okay.

29:47.423 --> 29:49.957
No.
No message.

29:50.009 --> 29:51.426
Arthur, hold on.

29:51.477 --> 29:53.812
We just found out Seth's a mole,
not a killer.

29:53.896 --> 29:55.647
He's been alone with Joan
on plenty of occasions

29:55.731 --> 29:56.815
without causing her harm.

29:56.899 --> 29:58.266
That's not
what I'm worried about.

29:58.317 --> 29:59.800
Well, what do you think
she's gonna do--

29:59.852 --> 30:01.152
sleep with him for payback?
- I didn't say that.

30:01.237 --> 30:02.520
It's only dinner.

30:02.605 --> 30:04.439
Trust me, Joan is not thinking
about payback right now.

30:04.490 --> 30:06.074
What do you mean?

30:06.141 --> 30:08.910
Nothing.
It's just--it's Joan.

30:08.977 --> 30:11.279
Let it play out.

30:11.330 --> 30:13.748
You leaned on us yesterday
to keep our mouths shut.

30:13.815 --> 30:15.283
Now suddenly you need
to talk to your wife?

30:15.334 --> 30:18.152
Until Annie gets out
of Seth's house safely,

30:18.204 --> 30:22.173
you're gonna have to wait
to clear your conscience, okay?

32:26.920 --> 32:29.122
You ready?

32:29.173 --> 32:30.456
You're not, are you?

32:30.507 --> 32:32.008
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

32:32.092 --> 32:34.427
I got home,
and I just crashed.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.045
You've had
a crazy couple days.

32:36.130 --> 32:37.830
- It's okay.
- I should have called you.

32:37.881 --> 32:40.767
I know,
but I was trying to rally.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.352
We'll rain check.

32:42.436 --> 32:44.437
Thank you.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.975
You know...

32:49.026 --> 32:50.777
I can't comprehend

32:50.844 --> 32:54.447
anybody ever taking you
for granted.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.047
Yes, I'm on a burner cell.

34:06.136 --> 34:09.088
No, she passed the polygraph.

34:09.139 --> 34:13.109
Yeah, she's on the fast track.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.813
Yeah, I have it right here.

34:17.898 --> 34:20.449
How about I bring it
to you tonight?

35:46.153 --> 35:49.488
No!

37:01.298 --> 37:02.548
I know you, Arthur.

37:02.599 --> 37:04.550
I know you better
than I know myself.

37:04.601 --> 37:06.685
So I find myself wondering

37:06.753 --> 37:08.521
just how
it would have been possible

37:08.588 --> 37:10.723
for you to have an affair
without me knowing--

37:10.774 --> 37:13.609
without you leaving
any possible trace.

37:13.693 --> 37:16.862
And then I realized...

37:16.930 --> 37:18.614
the polygraph.

37:18.698 --> 37:20.566
So what is it?

37:20.617 --> 37:22.935
You're right.

37:22.986 --> 37:25.571
I'm not having an affair.

37:25.622 --> 37:28.107
It was meant as a cover story.
To cover what?

37:28.158 --> 37:31.243
I got myself into a situation
where there were absolutely no--

37:31.294 --> 37:33.278
Stop spinning
and start talking.

37:33.330 --> 37:34.947
Just give me the headline.
What is going on here?

37:34.998 --> 37:37.383
I have a son.

37:37.450 --> 37:39.251
His name is Teo.

37:39.302 --> 37:41.670
He's 32 years old.
He lives in Colombia.

37:41.755 --> 37:43.672
Wow.

37:45.809 --> 37:50.462
That wasn't even in the top ten
of things I thought it might be.

37:50.514 --> 37:53.599
I can't tell you how sorry
I am about--about all of it.

37:53.650 --> 37:54.984
You know what?

37:55.068 --> 37:57.236
I need you
to stop talking, and...

37:57.303 --> 38:00.406
I need to use the bathroom.

38:00.473 --> 38:02.074
- Are you gonna be sick?
- I don't know.

38:02.142 --> 38:04.660
I'll figure it out
once I get there.

38:06.246 --> 38:08.614
I'm pregnant...

38:08.665 --> 38:10.950
by the way.

38:18.324 --> 38:21.127
I spent the last 30 minutes

38:21.178 --> 38:23.345
monitoring
public-safety scanners.

38:23.430 --> 38:25.848
So far, it seems no one has seen
or heard anything.

38:25.932 --> 38:27.433
No mention of a struggle

38:27.500 --> 38:29.468
nor a traffic incident
on the bridge

38:29.519 --> 38:31.503
nor a body falling
into the Potomac.

38:31.555 --> 38:34.440
So let's consider
ourselves lucky.

38:34.507 --> 38:36.175
Yeah.
Okay.

38:36.226 --> 38:37.860
Is there any chance we can
fish that thumb drive

38:37.944 --> 38:39.361
out of the river?

38:39.446 --> 38:42.148
No, even if we knew
where it was, it'd be too risky.

38:42.199 --> 38:44.366
Now, we have 48 hours

38:44.451 --> 38:46.902
before Langley starts
their investigation,

38:46.987 --> 38:49.121
unless someone reports
him missing before then.

38:49.189 --> 38:51.373
Someone's gonna see signs
of a struggle at his place?

38:51.458 --> 38:53.792
Is there anything there
that could lead back to you--

38:53.860 --> 38:56.128
any fingerprints, stray hairs,
drops of blood?

38:56.196 --> 38:57.463
What does it matter?

38:57.530 --> 38:59.215
It's not like we can enlist
a CIA cleaning crew

38:59.299 --> 39:00.716
to sweep the house
of their own lead counsel.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.886
Hey, you are not gonna
hang out there

39:03.970 --> 39:05.037
on your own on this.

39:05.088 --> 39:08.207
I won't let it happen.

39:08.258 --> 39:11.093
I know.

39:11.178 --> 39:12.394
Now...

39:12.479 --> 39:14.063
where does this go?

39:15.899 --> 39:16.882
My shoulder.

39:16.933 --> 39:18.684
Oh, I've heard of those.

39:18.735 --> 39:20.686
Allow me.

39:23.657 --> 39:25.824
How'd I do?

39:25.892 --> 39:27.660
That's my forehead.

39:27.727 --> 39:29.028
Oops.

39:37.403 --> 39:39.338
Who is it?

39:48.682 --> 39:51.433
It's Henry.

39:51.518 --> 39:54.103
He wants to meet me tomorrow.

39:56.256 --> 39:58.216
I wasn't expecting to hear
from you again so soon,

39:58.225 --> 39:59.725
after what you said.

39:59.776 --> 40:02.261
I've been giving our last
conversation some thought.

40:02.312 --> 40:06.899
You asked me
what I wanted you to do next.

40:09.619 --> 40:11.904
Looks nasty...

40:11.955 --> 40:13.105
and recent.

40:13.156 --> 40:15.407
What did you do?

40:15.458 --> 40:17.109
Fender bender.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.112
It happens.

40:20.163 --> 40:22.881
When I was at the farm, they
taught us to use our mirrors.

40:22.949 --> 40:25.251
I'm sure you didn't ask me out
here to criticize my driving.

40:25.302 --> 40:26.752
No...

40:26.803 --> 40:29.088
I didn't.

40:29.139 --> 40:33.842
I need you to go back down
to Colombia as soon as possible.

40:33.927 --> 40:36.345
Arthur has abdicated
his responsibility.

40:36.429 --> 40:39.765
It's up to us to fill the gap.
What kind of gap?

40:39.816 --> 40:42.985
I received intel that
the A.L.C. is planning an attack

40:43.069 --> 40:44.653
on American interests.

40:44.738 --> 40:46.855
Teo Braga is behind it.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.942
You've established
a contact with him,

40:49.993 --> 40:51.777
some kind of rapport.

40:51.828 --> 40:54.646
You may be the only one that can
get close enough to stop him.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.043
Are you asking me
to kill him?

41:08.128 --> 41:12.097
You've already told me twice
that you are in,

41:12.165 --> 41:15.968
without reservation.

41:16.019 --> 41:18.604
Time to back those words up,
Ms. Walker.
