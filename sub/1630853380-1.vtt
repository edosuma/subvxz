00:00.960 --> 00:04.320
The following programme
contains strong language.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.000
'The stocks are crashing globally
as the coronavirus

01:04.000 --> 01:05.600
'The stocks are crashing globally
as the coronavirus

01:05.640 --> 01:07.800
'disrupts lives
and ravages the economy.'

01:07.840 --> 01:11.200
'To contain the virus,
China is locking down entire cities

01:11.240 --> 01:12.000
'using tracing apps, drones, CCTV
and colored banners

01:12.000 --> 01:15.080
'using tracing apps, drones, CCTV

'to control and monitor
people's movement.'

01:18.120 --> 01:20.000
'You may ask about the Coronavirus,

01:20.000 --> 01:20.640
'You may ask about the Coronavirus,

01:20.680 --> 01:23.560
'which is very well
under control in our country.'

01:23.600 --> 01:26.600
'Germany finally
joins Italy, France and Spain,

'in imposing a total lockdown,

01:40.160 --> 01:42.680
'Following the news,
oil prices fell 10 point 1...'

01:53.520 --> 01:54.760
This is a play, right?

01:56.440 --> 01:57.880
You knew I'd come.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.000
Does there have to be a play?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.360
Does there have to be a play?

02:02.160 --> 02:03.440
Between me and you?

02:05.880 --> 02:08.000
Always.
I made my move.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.760
Always.
I made my move.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.280
Time to make yours.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.560
This is Dominic Morgan.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.000
The Deputy Consul General
is expecting my call.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.080
The Deputy Consul General
is expecting my call.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.880
I have the fugitive,
Massimo Ruggero.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.000
"The Camparino".

02:36.040 --> 02:38.280
You'll be back in London tonight.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.000
While the world faces catastrophe,
you'll be facing years behind bars.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.640
While the world faces catastrophe,
you'll be facing years behind bars.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.000
You changed, Massimo.
You're not the man I knew.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.560
You changed, Massimo.
You're not the man I knew.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.280
The world changed.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.000
From a time of certainties...

02:56.000 --> 02:56.320
From a time of certainties...

03:00.080 --> 03:02.080
..to a time when there were none.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.000
There's blood on your hands again.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.360
There's blood on your hands again.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.000
I will go to Parliament
and propose that the British people

03:12.000 --> 03:12.280
I will go to Parliament
and propose that the British people

03:12.320 --> 03:15.160
decide our future in Europe...

03:15.200 --> 03:18.400
through an in-out referendum
on Thursday, the 23rd of June.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.000
The choice is in your hands.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.560
The choice is in your hands.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.040
We are not sharks,
and finance is not water.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.000
I don't like metaphors,
so I'll speak plainly.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.560
I don't like metaphors,
so I'll speak plainly.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.240
Everything changes.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.640
We knew this.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.400
Just as we saw the benefits
of joining our friends from China,

03:40.440 --> 03:42.880
and making an awful lot of money.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.000
Yes.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.960
Yes.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.000
And... thanks also
to our brilliant Head of Trading,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.600
And... thanks also
to our brilliant Head of Trading,

03:55.640 --> 03:57.120
in her first year here.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.000
Might have been even better
if he'd given the job to one of us.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.200
Might have been even better
if he'd given the job to one of us.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.000
Now... the world around us
is about to change again.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.000
Whether the United Kingdom
stays or leaves the EU...

04:08.000 --> 04:11.320
Whether the United Kingdom
stays or leaves the EU...

04:11.360 --> 04:13.760
the effects will be enormous.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.000
This bank stands to make or lose
billions of pounds.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.840
This bank stands to make or lose
billions of pounds.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.720
But we don't fear change.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.280
We make it.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.800
Truly inspiring.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.000
I'm not so sure
about your Head of Risk,

04:32.000 --> 04:32.920
I'm not so sure
about your Head of Risk,

04:32.960 --> 04:34.080
but for what it's worth,

04:34.120 --> 04:36.080
your humble Chief of Strategy
stands with you,

04:36.120 --> 04:37.880
shoulder to shoulder.
Thank you, Liwei.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.000
Now, I have a red-eye to catch.
Where are you going?

04:40.000 --> 04:40.760
Now, I have a red-eye to catch.
Where are you going?

04:40.800 --> 04:44.520
South Korea, to watch a game.
Oh, enjoy.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.320
Massimo?
Stonehouse wants to see you.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.800
Yeah, sure.
OK.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.600
Jeremy.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.000
Stirring words.
Thank you.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.600
Stirring words.
Thank you.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.880
But with the sell-offs in January,
the bank is exposed

05:08.920 --> 05:11.160
and you are in danger
of missing your targets.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.680
We'll hit them with Brexit.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.800
That is far from certain.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.040
I take no pleasure in this,
but sometimes a global CEO

05:24.080 --> 05:26.600
has to speak uncomfortable truths.

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
Such as?

05:27.680 --> 05:28.000
You need to send a message
that the strong can no longer afford

05:28.000 --> 05:30.120
You need to send a message
that the strong can no longer afford

05:30.160 --> 05:31.360
to carry the weak.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.000
OK, but...
there is no weak link on my team.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.680
OK, but...
there is no weak link on my team.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.400
Naturally, it's not easy.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.720
Speak your mind, Chris. Come on.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.000
Well, there's an obvious candidate.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.360
Well, there's an obvious candidate.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.720
Kalim Chowdhrey.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.800
His numbers are awfully low
for a senior analyst.

05:51.840 --> 05:52.000
He's having a bad patch. That's all.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
He's having a bad patch. That's all.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.280
Dominic Morgan knew it wasn't enough
for a CEO to inspire.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.000
One has to instil fear.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.400
One has to instil fear.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.400
I'm glad you agree.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.000
Hi. Come in.
You wanted to see us?

06:16.000 --> 06:16.880
Hi. Come in.
You wanted to see us?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.440
We need new ideas...
quick wins to hit our targets.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.160
Well, surely
with the Brexit referendum...

06:22.200 --> 06:24.000
Even if we call it right,
it won't be enough.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.480
Even if we call it right,
it won't be enough.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.640
Not on its own.
I'm looking at a software company

06:26.680 --> 06:29.000
tracking the Ebola outbreak
in Africa.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.000
That's not a quick win,
Kalim. Eleanor?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.040
That's not a quick win,
Kalim. Eleanor?

06:33.080 --> 06:34.720
I, uhm...

06:34.760 --> 06:36.600
She's been focused
on the Brexit outcomes.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.160
Ellams Automotive.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.000
If the UK votes Leave,

06:40.000 --> 06:40.520
If the UK votes Leave,

06:40.560 --> 06:42.320
automotive companies
will be hit hard.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.760
Ellams isn't
just any automotive company.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.560
After Diesel-gate, they pivoted
from producing electric go-karts

06:47.600 --> 06:48.000
to mainstream electric batteries.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.080
to mainstream electric batteries.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.000
And green energy is growing.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.280
Ellams is on point,

06:52.320 --> 06:55.440
but to stay competitive
they need a massive cash injection.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.000
Massive cash injection,
massive commission.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.480
Massive cash injection,
massive commission.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.600
Alright. Check it out.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.080
Just for the record,
we will hit the numbers with Brexit.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.000
The consensus
is the vote will be Remain.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.440
The consensus
is the vote will be Remain.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.680
Consensus can be wrong.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.040
We'll make the right call.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.840
Good. Thank you.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.360
You were right about the referendum.
No, he was right.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.720
We need bullet-proof data
to hit our targets.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.000
If you say so.
I do, and I'm Head of Trading.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.280
If you say so.
I do, and I'm Head of Trading.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.000
I'm trying to protect you,
even though I know you resent that.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I don't resent you having the job.
Just... the reason you got it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.160
I don't resent you having the job.
Just... the reason you got it.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.280
It may assuage your ego
to think that I got the job

07:41.320 --> 07:42.880
because I'm Chinese.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.000
But I got the job
because I'm the better choice.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.280
But I got the job
because I'm the better choice.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
Right.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.000
The world holds its breath.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.160
The world holds its breath.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.880
News media gather in Seoul
from all five continents

07:55.920 --> 07:58.000
to watch the world's greatest
Go player

07:58.040 --> 08:00.000
face off against a computer
programmed to defeat him.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.240
face off against a computer
programmed to defeat him.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.920
The woman shaking
the champion's hand

08:02.960 --> 08:05.920
will be making moves
on behalf of the computer.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.000
Go is an incredibly complex
and subtle game.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Go is an incredibly complex
and subtle game.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.280
Up to now, the idea
that artificial intelligence

08:11.320 --> 08:14.880
could defeat a human being
has been thought impossible.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.000
The match begins.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.200
The match begins.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
Can machine beat man at last?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.000
So far, the game is proving
far more challenging

08:24.000 --> 08:26.480
So far, the game is proving
far more challenging

08:26.520 --> 08:28.280
than analysts predicted.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.120
The champion is taking time
to plot his countermoves.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.000
He would seem to be struggling.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.680
He would seem to be struggling.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.880
He is certainly tanking his time.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.440
He seems uncertain.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.040
You see the suspense on the faces
of the programming team,

08:44.080 --> 08:45.880
watching here
and from all over the planet.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.000
This is not the match
anyone was expecting.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.040
This is not the match
anyone was expecting.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.880
It seems we are on the verge
of the unthinkable.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.000
For decades,
programmers have sought

08:56.000 --> 08:56.120
For decades,
programmers have sought

08:56.160 --> 08:58.800
to write software
that could outsmart a human mind.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.480
But here we see
the world's greatest player

09:01.520 --> 09:03.480
not only struggling
with the computer,

09:03.520 --> 09:04.000
but seemingly at risk
of actually losing the match.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.800
but seemingly at risk
of actually losing the match.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.280
I can't believe
what I am seeing right now.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.000
Oh, my goodness!
And the champion resigns.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.400
Oh, my goodness!
And the champion resigns.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.600
And it's over.
The game won by the computer.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.000
This is a first, A.I. beats mankind.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.160
This is a first, A.I. beats mankind.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.800
Dominic.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.240
I didn't expect to see you
in this part of the world.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.000
This is the battlefield.
That's why you're here.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.040
This is the battlefield.
That's why you're here.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.800
Isn't it?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.200
If you're suggesting there's
a war between China and America,

09:59.240 --> 10:00.000
you're wrong.
We're friends, not enemies.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.280
you're wrong.
We're friends, not enemies.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.080
There cannot be two suns in the sky.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.000
"Go" is not life, Dominic.
We can all be winners.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.440
"Go" is not life, Dominic.
We can all be winners.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.720
Right.

10:18.680 --> 10:19.880
Excuse me?

10:21.360 --> 10:22.640
You dropped this.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.240
Yes...

10:26.480 --> 10:28.000
It's the last three moves.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.000
You saw the end of the game
before the computer.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.000
How?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.080
How?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.600
Uhm...

10:38.000 --> 10:39.400
What's your name?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.680
Nadya Wojcik.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.240
You must be a student.
Computer science?

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
Mathematics.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.000
More or less.
More or less?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
More or less.
More or less?

10:51.240 --> 10:55.480
My visa expired.
I'm going home to Warsaw.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.000
To do what?

10:56.000 --> 10:56.560
To do what?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.200
How would you like a job in London?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.000
Doing what?
You like mathematics.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.120
Doing what?
You like mathematics.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.640
I will show you how to use it...
in the real world.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
Here's my card.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.000
Nice to meet you, Nadya Wojcik.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.080
Nice to meet you, Nadya Wojcik.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.880
Pick up the phone

11:39.720 --> 11:42.040
Uh-uh, no you won't...
Oh, yes, I will!

11:48.080 --> 11:49.840
What the f...

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
What the hell was that?
You could've got us both killed.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.560
What the hell was that?
You could've got us both killed.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.240
But I didn't, did I?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.840
Nice driving!

12:05.880 --> 12:08.000
Hey. I didn't know electric cars
could go so fast.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.200
Hey. I didn't know electric cars
could go so fast.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.600
Completely new type
of solid-state battery.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.760
This company has been in my family
for three generations, Mr Ruggero.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.640
Mr Ellams,
Massimo would not be here

12:15.680 --> 12:16.000
if we didn't take this seriously.
I'd like to see more.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.880
if we didn't take this seriously.
I'd like to see more.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.360
Oh, please. Take a look around!
Let's go.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.960
Well?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.920
We still need Brexit
to hit our targets.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.240
But I'm impressed.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.000
You're not much of a driver.
But you know what you're doing.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.800
You're not much of a driver.
But you know what you're doing.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.040
I was starting to wonder
if you thought so... coming here.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.000
Why are you babysitting me?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.320
Why are you babysitting me?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.480
I told you.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.240
We need to hit our targets.
Alright.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.000
Alright.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.280
Alright.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.520
I know you wanted
to be Head of Trading.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.520
Look... Zhi's good. Right?

12:52.560 --> 12:55.800
And... I respect her, but...
I'm pretty good, too.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.000
I know.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.280
I know.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.920
And I'll take care of you.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.240
Come on.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.720
How's Kalim doing?
He's fine.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.960
Are you sure?

13:12.280 --> 13:13.760
His numbers aren't great.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.320
Massimo...

13:20.080 --> 13:21.520
You used to have our backs.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.160
I used to not be CEO.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.000
I'm going back to the office.
Take a look around.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.400
I'm going back to the office.
Take a look around.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.760
Make sure there are no surprises.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.920
Hey. See you tomorrow?

13:33.960 --> 13:35.120
Do you still want me?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.680
Well... you still think
you can handle it?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.640
Yeah. Yeah?

13:49.160 --> 13:50.360
I need to get one of these.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.880
It's been four years.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.120
Wouldn't you sleep better
knowing why I'm here?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.200
This isn't easy for me either.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.640
OK. But make it quick.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.320
Twenty years ago we thought if we
could export manufacturing to China,

16:07.360 --> 16:08.000
they would then in fact
embrace democracy.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.760
they would then in fact
embrace democracy.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.280
They took our manufacturing.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.680
But passed on democracy.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.040
All we really did was exchange
cheap goods for workers' rights.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.000
Entire segments of the economy
have been hollowed out.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.800
Entire segments of the economy
have been hollowed out.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.000
We fought a war with China
and we still don't realize we lost.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.320
We fought a war with China
and we still don't realize we lost.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.400
Chinamerica was your creation.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.080
I made a mistake.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.480
I can admit that.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.040
Your friends on the 13th floor
don't see it that way.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.240
All they care about is making money.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.000
And you don't?
I know you, Dominic...

16:48.000 --> 16:49.120
And you don't?
I know you, Dominic...

16:50.080 --> 16:51.560
I was in Seoul this week.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.240
A.I. beat the best player
mankind could field.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.000
Starting a whole new war.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.600
Starting a whole new war.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.480
Only this one is over data.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.800
And the West cannot afford
to lose again.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.880
You've made a lot of money
working with the Chinese

17:03.920 --> 17:04.000
these past four years.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.320
these past four years.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.040
You're the best.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.920
I want you on my team.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.000
Not theirs.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.080
Not theirs.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.640
You don't have a team, Dominic.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.040
I didn't have anything
to do with the death of that girl.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.360
She had a name.

18:42.440 --> 18:48.000
But you can't sleep

18:48.000 --> 18:48.400
But you can't sleep

18:55.680 --> 18:56.000
Do you really think that
Dominic had Sofia Flores killed?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.760
Do you really think that
Dominic had Sofia Flores killed?

19:02.320 --> 19:04.000
I don't know. You tell me.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.520
I don't know. You tell me.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.320
You and your friends.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.560
I would never agree to such a thing.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.720
Massimo, I'm sorry to tell you this,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.320
but there's been
a terrible accident.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.520
Sofia Flores, she was killed
by a hit-and-run driver.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.120
Do you vow to provide your child
a Christian home of love and peace?

19:33.160 --> 19:35.840
To raise him in the truth
of our Lord's instruction?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.480
We do.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.560
Do you declare your desire
to help these parents

19:43.600 --> 19:44.000
to fulfil their vow?
I do.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.120
to fulfil their vow?
I do.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.760
This is Adrian Isiah Harris.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.000
We lift him up
in the presence of the Lord.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
We lift him up
in the presence of the Lord.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.520
Amina, how are you?
I'm good. How are you?

19:59.560 --> 20:00.000
I'm good. Thank you.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'm good. Thank you.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.360
You got a minute?
Yeah.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
You know that Ebola
tracking software app I mentioned?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.000
I really think it has potential.
Real potential.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.360
I really think it has potential.
Real potential.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.400
I looked at it.
It might work in Asia.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.320
But nobody here is going to allow
that kind of access

20:15.360 --> 20:16.000
to their personal data, you know?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.360
to their personal data, you know?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.440
But I disagree.
Think about what happens if...

20:19.480 --> 20:22.600
Kalim, let's just be friends today.
Right?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.000
Excuse us.
Thank you.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.320
Excuse us.
Thank you.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.280
Don't push him. Rumor has it
they're looking for a scalp.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.920
A scalp?

20:30.960 --> 20:32.000
I'm about to kill
every functioning work relationship

20:32.000 --> 20:34.080
I'm about to kill
every functioning work relationship

20:34.120 --> 20:35.360
with ill-judged small talk.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.600
I might not be the guy to help.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.000
Want another drink?
Please.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.360
Want another drink?
Please.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.720
I still think you should have
got Head of Trading.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.000
You should talk to Massimo.
I know, I did.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.000
What did he say?
That he'll take care of me.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.760
What did he say?
That he'll take care of me.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.520
Congratulations.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.440
Thank you.
Hey, hey.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.000
Who's your favorite godfather?
I told you, you got to earn that.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.200
Who's your favorite godfather?
I told you, you got to earn that.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.280
Daddy, look!

21:01.160 --> 21:03.280
And what's your name?
Carter.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.240
You have children, Zhi?
No. Too busy with work.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.080
Massimo's excuse, too.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.800
OK.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.080
Let's have another drink.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.000
After a final few days
of campaigning...

21:20.040 --> 21:22.120
Vote remain!
Tomorrow, Thursday! Go for it!

21:24.680 --> 21:26.960
Philip! What a nice surprise.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm not prepared to gamble
the future of my children...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.040
I'm not prepared to gamble
the future of my children...

21:32.400 --> 21:35.280
Nice place you have here.
It's coming along.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.000
Tea...

21:36.000 --> 21:36.400
Tea...

21:36.440 --> 21:39.000
Yes, help yourself.
In the corner, please.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.000
Some crazy rumour's...
floating around,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.360
Some crazy rumour's...
floating around,

21:45.400 --> 21:49.880
that, uh...
this is a 50-billion-dollar SPAC

21:49.920 --> 21:52.000
unintended to fight China.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.200
unintended to fight China.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.920
Those rumors aren't so crazy.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.000
Then you must be.

22:00.000 --> 22:00.880
Then you must be.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.600
You don't have a biscuit, do you?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.040
Oh, thank you.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.000
We're at war...

22:08.000 --> 22:08.800
We're at war...

22:08.840 --> 22:09.840
Philip.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.440
I never discount your analysis.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.920
The 13th floor
has brought you here...

22:22.960 --> 22:24.000
to bring me back on side.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.840
to bring me back on side.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.200
You're still one of us, Dominic.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.600
Just a little out of step
with the mainstream.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.000
Who might be backing
this little venture of yours?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.560
Who might be backing
this little venture of yours?

22:33.600 --> 22:36.320
You join me...
and I might just tell you.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.000
Good morning!
Hi!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.320
Good morning!
Hi!

22:49.360 --> 22:50.720
Hey.
Where are you going?

22:50.760 --> 22:54.000
Daunt Tolliver want in
on the Ellams Automotive IPO.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.000
I don't like them.
They came to us.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.160
I don't like them.
They came to us.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.400
Now, with them as guarantor
we could leverage other investors.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.640
Hm.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.000
I thought you'd be pleased.
I'm not. Find someone else.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.880
I thought you'd be pleased.
I'm not. Find someone else.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.360
Why?
Just do it.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.280
Good morning.
Good morning.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.000
Everything alright?

23:20.000 --> 23:20.520
Everything alright?

23:20.560 --> 23:23.880
It's a personal matter.
What's on your mind?

23:23.920 --> 23:27.160
We have a fund sniffing around
Ellams Automotive.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.000
Daunt Tolliver. I heard.
Hm.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.200
Daunt Tolliver. I heard.
Hm.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.760
It didn't make sense to me either.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.280
I ran into Dominic Morgan.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.000
I saw him in Seoul last week.
What did he say?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I saw him in Seoul last week.
What did he say?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.800
Not much.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.120
See you later.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.000
Wu Zhi, Head of Trading.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.880
Damian Curtis,
Chief Analyst at Tellers.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.000
I knew Kalim
when he was cutting Arabic class

23:52.000 --> 23:53.080
I knew Kalim
when he was cutting Arabic class

23:53.120 --> 23:55.120
at Gilwell Park Mosque
to sneak a bacon sandwich.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.640
Woah, watch it, you.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.760
I know all his dirty secrets.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.000
Oh, too far.
This is my associate, Agnes Sharma.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.720
Oh, too far.
This is my associate, Agnes Sharma.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.960
I was just telling
Eleanor about Damian's use

24:04.000 --> 24:06.080
of "emotional resonance scoring".

24:06.120 --> 24:08.000
It's the only technique
capable of making predictions

24:08.000 --> 24:08.560
It's the only technique
capable of making predictions

24:08.600 --> 24:12.120
based on voters' conscious and
subconscious emotional volatility.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.280
But Brexit's
a particularly emotional issue,

24:14.320 --> 24:16.000
so we've had to go even further.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.280
so we've had to go even further.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.160
Please, explain.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.120
So, we pay a modest fee for people
to use a "training set" app.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.960
A 120-question personality quiz

24:24.000 --> 24:26.240
that we've customized
from the insights we've gleaned

24:26.280 --> 24:28.160
from their social media profiles.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.720
It's like an incredibly
accurate dating app.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.000
Only instead of predicting
who you're compatible with...

24:32.000 --> 24:33.600
Only instead of predicting
who you're compatible with...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.880
..it predicts how
you're going to vote.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.000
And how certain are you
of these predictions?

24:40.000 --> 24:40.640
And how certain are you
of these predictions?

24:40.680 --> 24:45.600
In the case of undecided voters,
the voters we call 'persuadables',

24:45.640 --> 24:48.000
we know which way they're going
to vote... before they do.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.240
we know which way they're going
to vote... before they do.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.880
You understand NYL would be betting
hundreds of millions of pounds,

24:54.920 --> 24:56.000
and has to know
which way Brexit will go.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and has to know
which way Brexit will go.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.440
If I was a betting man?

25:01.520 --> 25:03.560
I'd bet everything
I have on this data.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.000
Today, both sides rushed to bring
people together at the ballot box

25:12.000 --> 25:12.680
Today, both sides rushed to bring
people together at the ballot box

25:12.720 --> 25:16.040
for a resounding vote
that has in some ways

25:16.080 --> 25:18.800
already changed the country.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:20.000 --> 25:20.560
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.800
this is Nadya Wojcik.
She will be joining us.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.160
Please make sure she gets all the
data for the car batteries.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.000
Would you find a table,
please, and sit down.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.320
Would you find a table,
please, and sit down.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.560
What table?

25:30.720 --> 25:33.880
Take that one over in the
corner. Won't you, please? Ok?

25:41.880 --> 25:44.000
We've been telling you
about a possible British exit,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.160
We've been telling you
about a possible British exit,

25:45.200 --> 25:47.040
or Brexit, for months now.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.240
And all the way through the
campaign it's been about divisions.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.000
Not just Britain breaking
away from Europe,

25:52.000 --> 25:52.320
Not just Britain breaking
away from Europe,

25:52.360 --> 25:54.840
but Britain
breaking away from itself.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.840
Chris.

25:57.880 --> 25:58.960
What do you want?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Quarterly results came in.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.280
Quarterly results came in.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.400
The numbers aren't good.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.360
What if I chose to cut you
instead of Kalim, Chris?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.000
You'd never get that
past Stonehouse.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
You'd never get that
past Stonehouse.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.920
I just got off
the phone with Huang Capital.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.280
Hi, Chris.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.040
I just got off the phone
with Huang Capital

26:18.080 --> 26:20.200
and they want in
on Ellams Automotive

26:20.240 --> 26:22.360
at 50% above the exchange price.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.000
Take it.
Send Daunt Tolliver packing.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.480
Take it.
Send Daunt Tolliver packing.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.080
God bless the Chinese, huh?

26:29.640 --> 26:30.680
Ellams won't be enough.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.680
You still need that win
on the Brexit referendum.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.720
That'll be all, Chris.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.000
Let's take back control!
Take back control.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.320
Let's take back control!
Take back control.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.440
We'll take back control!
Take back control for our country...

26:53.640 --> 26:56.000
Hi. What do our expensive
new pollsters say?

26:56.000 --> 26:56.440
Hi. What do our expensive
new pollsters say?

26:56.480 --> 26:59.560
They're calling the referendum
for Remain.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.200
How sure are we about that data?
Pretty damn sure.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.560
But not certain.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.800
It's the best data we have.
And you think it's good enough?

27:07.840 --> 27:09.600
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Good.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.000
Well, we have to go all in
if we want to hit our targets.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.160
Well, we have to go all in
if we want to hit our targets.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.560
Then we'd better do it.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.680
Kalim, we need to talk.
Four o'clock?

27:19.840 --> 27:20.000
I have the afternoon off.
I'm picking up the kids.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.840
I have the afternoon off.
I'm picking up the kids.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.240
OK. Tomorrow then.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.000
OK.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.320
OK.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.480
Thank you.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.880
Nadya. Come in.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.080
Come in.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.440
I've reviewed that data
on the car batteries.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.000
That was fast. And?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.280
That was fast. And?

27:54.320 --> 27:56.000
I sent you the report.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
How was your first day?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.440
People are staring at me.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.800
Well, they don't understand
why you're here.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.000
Neither do I.

28:08.000 --> 28:08.680
Neither do I.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.720
Hm.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.000
My son, John.
He died in Afghanistan.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.960
My son, John.
He died in Afghanistan.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.720
Your ex-wife is in prison.
For manslaughter.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.120
How do you know that?

28:39.600 --> 28:40.000
The Internet.
Hm.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.040
The Internet.
Hm.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.600
What's this?

28:47.640 --> 28:48.000
Oh. The ball.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Oh. The ball.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.240
I caught that when
I was a kid at a Celtics game.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.000
And Bill Russel
said I could keep it.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.400
And Bill Russel
said I could keep it.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.760
Bill Russel?
My favorite player.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.080
I taught John how to dribble
with this ball.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.000
And he ended up making varsity.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.120
And he ended up making varsity.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.720
Not that I got a chance
to watch him play that much.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.120
Did you tell your parents
you are here?

29:18.160 --> 29:19.720
No.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.000
Maybe you should.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Maybe you should.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.480
They think I'm strange.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.000
They don't speak to me.
I'm sorry.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.080
They don't speak to me.
I'm sorry.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.480
Good night. Good night.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.480
Good night.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.720
To the best team of this year
to trade the floor.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.000
To you, guys.
Cin-cin! Yeah!

30:00.000 --> 30:01.520
To you, guys.
Cin-cin! Yeah!

30:01.560 --> 30:03.600
Now we're in profit!

30:15.560 --> 30:16.000
Hey. Offer's in from Huang Capital.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.560
Hey. Offer's in from Huang Capital.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.040
Is there a problem?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.800
Well... they want to restructure.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.000
It's a- it's a massive
switch to automation.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
It's a- it's a massive
switch to automation.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.520
What's the bottom line for us?

30:28.560 --> 30:32.000
Well, if we go with the Chinese
we'll net a bigger profit,

30:32.000 --> 30:32.080
Well, if we go with the Chinese
we'll net a bigger profit,

30:32.120 --> 30:35.200
but half of the Ellam's workforce
could end up on the street, so...

30:37.400 --> 30:39.680
We don't do our jobs,
we're the ones out of work.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.160
Maybe we can square the circle
somehow, hm?

30:44.600 --> 30:45.880
Isn't that what you always say?

30:47.520 --> 30:48.000
Not this time.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.600
Not this time.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Hey, are you OK?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.120
Hey, are you OK?

31:00.240 --> 31:01.520
I'm fine.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.000
Drive back up to Ellams
and get him to sign.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.920
Drive back up to Ellams
and get him to sign.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.280
Whatever it takes.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.440
Wanker!

31:33.280 --> 31:35.640
I heard what happened outside.
I'm sorry.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.000
That's not who our workers are.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.480
That's not who our workers are.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.840
Uh, I take it they
heard about the Chinese offer...

31:40.880 --> 31:44.000
They've heard there'll be massive
layoffs and then there's the video.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.040
They've heard there'll be massive
layoffs and then there's the video.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.480
What video?

31:45.520 --> 31:46.720
Jennifer?

31:47.840 --> 31:50.320
This was made
for a plant Huang Capital acquired

31:50.360 --> 31:52.000
last year in Pennsylvania.
It's not that we are anti-union.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.040
last year in Pennsylvania.
It's not that we are anti-union.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.440
But labour organizations
by their very nature

31:55.480 --> 31:57.640
stand between us and our associates.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.000
There are danger signs
that you need to look at,

32:00.000 --> 32:00.640
There are danger signs
that you need to look at,

32:00.680 --> 32:02.480
like workers congregating after work

32:02.520 --> 32:06.080
and the use of phrases
such as "living wage".

32:06.120 --> 32:08.000
This is the video
the Chinese produced in America

32:08.000 --> 32:08.280
This is the video
the Chinese produced in America

32:08.320 --> 32:09.840
to bust the union there.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.360
Organized labor is getting...
squeezed everywhere.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.200
Yeah, that doesn't make it OK.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.520
Does it?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.520
We should do what we can
to change it.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.480
We're in finance, not politics.
We have targets to hit.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.000
So, just...
forget about everyone else?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.800
So, just...
forget about everyone else?

32:26.840 --> 32:29.000
Let all these workers
lose their jobs?

32:29.040 --> 32:31.120
Look, I could go back
to Daunt Tolliver, right?

32:31.160 --> 32:32.000
I could see if they could
improve their tender.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
I could see if they could
improve their tender.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.160
We're going with Huang Capital. Hm?

32:36.320 --> 32:37.840
That's it.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.000
Good night, sir.

32:48.000 --> 32:48.800
Good night, sir.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.960
There's only one important item

33:22.000 --> 33:24.520
on the agendas for investors
across the world today.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.240
Britain is heading to the polls

33:26.280 --> 33:28.000
after a lengthy
and bitterly fought campaign,

33:28.000 --> 33:28.840
after a lengthy
and bitterly fought campaign,

33:28.880 --> 33:32.280
to decide whether to stay
in the European Union or to leave.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.960
Don't forget to vote.
Yeah.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.000
I love you.
I love you, too.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.560
I love you.
I love you, too.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.880
Massimo?
Which way will it go?

33:48.920 --> 33:52.000
Well, given the margin of error,
it's too close to call.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.320
Well, given the margin of error,
it's too close to call.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.520
That's not the kind of prediction
we paid all that money for.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.640
Well, Damian Curtis
is calling for Remain,

33:57.680 --> 34:00.000
but he'll be monitoring
the exit data in real time

34:00.000 --> 34:00.240
but he'll be monitoring
the exit data in real time

34:00.280 --> 34:02.080
and feeding it to us by video-link.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.840
So, we call it as it happens?
I have this. Believe me.

34:06.240 --> 34:08.000
Alright. See you later.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.240
Alright. See you later.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.000
Definitely out!
Definitely out.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.760
In. In.
Out! Out.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.120
In!
Out!

34:13.160 --> 34:15.520
In the final sprint
to try to influence opinion,

34:15.560 --> 34:16.000
the last of the major newspapers
have declared their positions

34:16.000 --> 34:18.400
the last of the major newspapers
have declared their positions

34:18.440 --> 34:21.400
four in favour of leaving
the rest want to remain.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.840
And more than 1,200 businesses
have signed...

34:23.880 --> 34:24.000
On you go, Paki! Fuck off home!

34:24.000 --> 34:25.880
On you go, Paki! Fuck off home!

34:25.920 --> 34:27.360
What the fuck!?
Leave it.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.120
You stupid narrow-minded bastard!
Where are you from?

34:30.160 --> 34:31.360
Stevenage.
Oh, yeah?

34:31.400 --> 34:32.000
Well, he was born
two miles from here.

34:32.000 --> 34:32.960
Well, he was born
two miles from here.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.880
So, why don't you piss off home,
OK?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.440
The big vote for Britain
and its future

34:37.480 --> 34:40.000
with or without the European Union
is just hours away now.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.320
with or without the European Union
is just hours away now.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.080
What's the forecast?
Unchanged.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.360
I'm calling Remain
with 52.1% of the vote.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.880
Then that's how we bet.
We are focusing on that clock again

34:52.920 --> 34:56.000
as it marches relentlessly
towards 10 o'clock.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.040
as it marches relentlessly
towards 10 o'clock.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.840
There are only moments left to wait.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.000
A surprise announcement,
as Nigel Farage,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.120
A surprise announcement,
as Nigel Farage,

35:05.160 --> 35:06.840
the leader of the
UK Independence Party,

35:06.880 --> 35:09.440
concedes defeat
ahead of the official result.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.000
I knew it.
Damian's polling was right.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.560
I knew it.
Damian's polling was right.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.120
The Pound will start to climb.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.000
He's saying Remain is going to win.
Why don't you look happy?

35:20.000 --> 35:20.920
He's saying Remain is going to win.
Why don't you look happy?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.680
Why concede so soon?

35:25.840 --> 35:28.000
We have the largest turnout
in the history of our democracy...

35:28.000 --> 35:29.720
We have the largest turnout
in the history of our democracy...

35:31.400 --> 35:33.160
Massimo?

35:35.240 --> 35:36.000
There is something wrong.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.360
There is something wrong.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.200
Farage is just telling us which way
the wind is blowing, that's all.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.480
Or...

35:41.520 --> 35:44.000
that's the way he wants the markets
to think the wind is blowing.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.560
that's the way he wants the markets
to think the wind is blowing.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.680
Kalim...
Something strange is going on.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.000
Counting is under way
of tens of millions of votes

35:52.000 --> 35:52.160
Counting is under way
of tens of millions of votes

35:52.200 --> 35:54.000
across most of Britain right now.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.800
Markets already sensing danger...

35:55.840 --> 35:57.920
It is a leave vote
here in Sunderland tonight.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.000
A 60-40 split.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.400
A 60-40 split.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.560
And the result
is announced in Sunderland.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.840
A majority of 61% for Leave!

36:05.880 --> 36:07.040
That really is a surprise!

36:07.080 --> 36:08.000
These returns
don't align with my forecast.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.880
These returns
don't align with my forecast.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.600
It's still gonna be Remain,
like you said.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.160
I sure hope so, bro.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.000
The market's beginning to shift.
Pound's dropping.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.680
The market's beginning to shift.
Pound's dropping.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.400
That's not good news for us.
Leave could take it, couldn't it?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.000
It looks as if Leave
is edging into the lead.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.920
It looks as if Leave
is edging into the lead.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.600
Damian?
We've bet on the pound rising.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.000
On Remain, like you said.

36:32.000 --> 36:32.760
On Remain, like you said.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.320
Damian?

36:34.360 --> 36:36.400
The Sterling is falling
against the dollar.

36:37.640 --> 36:38.960
This isn't possible.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Let June the 23rd
go down in our history

36:40.000 --> 36:42.800
Let June the 23rd
go down in our history

36:42.840 --> 36:45.120
as our independence day!

36:45.160 --> 36:47.920
So much for Farage conceding. Liar.

36:50.960 --> 36:55.800
We at ITV News
are calling this as a Leave victory.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.000
An extraordinary moment
in British history.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.080
An extraordinary moment
in British history.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.360
The shock to our economy
after leaving Europe,

37:01.400 --> 37:03.520
would tip
the country into recession.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.960
Let June the 23rd
go down in our history

37:08.000 --> 37:11.200
as our independence day!

37:11.240 --> 37:12.000
The British people have spoken
and the answer is, we're out.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.880
The British people have spoken
and the answer is, we're out.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.000
Sterling just fell off a cliff.
The bank's position is exposed.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.960
We have to sell now
and minimize NYL's losses.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.040
Wait.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.640
Sterling started the day
at 1 dollar 48.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.000
A lot of people
will have lost a lot of money.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.200
A lot of people
will have lost a lot of money.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.680
Wallstreet plummeting more than
600 points, as the faces in Britain,

37:49.720 --> 37:51.960
those who thought
there was no way this could happen,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.160
tell their own story.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.920
The Pound is being sold off
quite aggressively now.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.360
It's now down 8 and a half percent.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.000
The last time we were at that level
was in 1985.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.440
The last time we were at that level
was in 1985.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.240
The last time we saw...
Zhi, what do you say?

38:04.280 --> 38:06.720
Sterling's going to bottom out.
Then we'll buy.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.960
Buy?!
We're losing money hand over fist.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Banks, hedge funds,
everyone else is bloody selling.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.960
Banks, hedge funds,
everyone else is bloody selling.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.800
Massimo, there's blood
all over the floor.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.080
She said wait.

38:34.320 --> 38:37.760
Sterling's holding at 1.35.
Let's buy now.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.400
Not yet.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.360
1.32...

38:54.400 --> 38:56.000
The Pound is now at 1 dollar 32.
This is quite extraordinary.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.240
The Pound is now at 1 dollar 32.
This is quite extraordinary.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.160
It looks like
the Pound is stabilizing.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.800
Buy!
How much?

39:15.840 --> 39:17.200
One billion Pounds!

39:17.240 --> 39:19.040
Enough to cover our losses,
and then some.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.560
What do you think you're doing?
Recovering our position.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.000
You've exceeded all limits!
This is bloody madness!

39:36.000 --> 39:37.920
You've exceeded all limits!
This is bloody madness!

39:37.960 --> 39:39.560
Chris, stay out of this, please.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.960
Alright, I will.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Stonehouse will not stand for this.
Go ahead and call him.

39:44.000 --> 39:44.560
Stonehouse will not stand for this.
Go ahead and call him.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.720
We'll be done
before you get through. Come on.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.800
It's going up!

40:04.960 --> 40:06.640
Should we get out?
Not yet.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.640
Massimo...
Hold your nerve.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.240
It's peaking.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.320
Get out
before we start losing again.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.080
Jesus!

40:20.640 --> 40:22.120
Cash-out!
Come on! Sell.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.000
Well, you look at that.
We nearly made it all back.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.080
Well, you look at that.
We nearly made it all back.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.520
Just like the old days, huh?

40:51.560 --> 40:54.760
Pirates back here again
and killing it! Come on, man!

41:00.680 --> 41:02.800
Tomorrow morning, my office.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.000
You recklessly exceeded all risk
limits without any authorization.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.680
You recklessly exceeded all risk
limits without any authorization.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.240
You left us completely exposed.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.560
I made a call that kept NYL
from losing millions.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.920
I'm CEO, Chris.

41:11.960 --> 41:12.000
Well, for every million we lost,
you should have made two.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.400
Well, for every million we lost,
you should have made two.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.160
There's no dressing the truth.

41:19.800 --> 41:20.000
Late morning, Prime Minister Cameron
going to Buckingham Palace,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.960
Late morning, Prime Minister Cameron
going to Buckingham Palace,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.680
meeting with Queen Elizabeth
to chart a way forward,

41:26.720 --> 41:28.000
and the hangover,
in some cases regret...

41:28.000 --> 41:29.920
and the hangover,
in some cases regret...

41:29.960 --> 41:32.800
It's simply because this morning
the reality is actually hitting in,

41:32.840 --> 41:34.840
and I feel we made a big mistake.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.000
What happens next is that Britain
and Europe must now negotiate

41:36.000 --> 41:38.520
What happens next is that Britain
and Europe must now negotiate

41:38.560 --> 41:40.880
a complicated and painful divorce.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.760
There's hundreds of billions
of dollars,

41:42.800 --> 41:44.000
thousands of laws
that need to get sorted out.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.440
thousands of laws
that need to get sorted out.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.120
An extraordinary moment
in British history.

41:57.160 --> 42:00.000
Britain wants to go slow on that,
but today EU leaders

42:00.000 --> 42:02.040
Britain wants to go slow on that,
but today EU leaders

42:02.080 --> 42:06.160
say they want Britain out
for good... as soon as possible.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.000
I love this country and
I feel honored to have served it.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.920
I love this country and
I feel honored to have served it.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.000
And with that, the Prime Minister
who led us to Brexit

42:14.040 --> 42:16.000
made way for his successor,
who must now lead us through it.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.360
made way for his successor,
who must now lead us through it.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.840
Hi.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.120
Take a seat.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.000
I don't know what happened
with Damian Curtis

42:40.000 --> 42:41.280
I don't know what happened
with Damian Curtis

42:41.320 --> 42:43.360
and his polling predictions...

42:43.400 --> 42:45.720
This isn't about
Damian Curtis, Kalim.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.560
I'm the scalp?

42:54.800 --> 42:56.000
Your numbers are down.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.320
Your numbers are down.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.640
And Stonehouse wants you out.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.680
I have no choice.

43:03.720 --> 43:04.000
I'm sorry.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I'm sorry.

43:05.040 --> 43:09.280
Right. You are sorry?
But you have a choice.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.120
You're the CEO... here!

43:11.160 --> 43:12.000
But it's easier to blame it
on Stonehouse, the bank...

43:12.000 --> 43:13.960
But it's easier to blame it
on Stonehouse, the bank...

43:14.000 --> 43:16.960
Anything and anyone but you.
Kalim...

43:17.000 --> 43:19.840
Just like you blamed others
with what happened to Sofia.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.920
I know...
you hate yourself, Massimo.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.000
You've become everything
you once despised.

43:28.000 --> 43:28.480
You've become everything
you once despised.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.440
Uhm...

43:34.480 --> 43:36.000
I'll write you a recommendation.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.360
I'll write you a recommendation.

43:36.400 --> 43:40.280
In the meantime...
you can take gardening leave.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.000
So you don't have to look at me
in the eye every day?

43:44.000 --> 43:44.800
So you don't have to look at me
in the eye every day?

43:44.840 --> 43:47.360
No, no, no, no... No.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.600
I'll work out my notice.

43:49.640 --> 43:52.000
I'm the one
who brought Damian Curtis in,

43:52.000 --> 43:52.480
I'm the one
who brought Damian Curtis in,

43:52.520 --> 43:56.360
and the others...
are relying on me. Me.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.240
OK.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.000
Are you OK?
Yeah, yeah.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.640
What's up with you?

44:47.360 --> 44:48.000
Um, this Ellams deal...
I am all over social media.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.760
Um, this Ellams deal...
I am all over social media.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.240
Apparently, I'm the wanker
everyone's angry at.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.000
Like anonymous death threats' angry.

44:56.000 --> 44:56.320
Like anonymous death threats' angry.

44:58.120 --> 45:00.160
You told the police?
No.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.480
No, it would freak Latoyah out.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.000
It's nothing.

45:04.000 --> 45:04.640
It's nothing.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.720
Watch yourself, yeah?
Yeah.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.160
Rebecca, before the vote,

45:25.200 --> 45:27.080
you said you felt
the country wanted change

45:27.120 --> 45:28.000
and you were right
when so many were wrong.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.040
and you were right
when so many were wrong.

45:29.080 --> 45:31.240
Why?
I'm always right, Stephen.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.840
If you read my column this morning
you'd know that.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.240
No, but seriously...

45:35.280 --> 45:36.000
To make money investing you have
to know more than the markets.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.440
To make money investing you have
to know more than the markets.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.200
You have to know people.

45:40.240 --> 45:44.000
And people are sick of being told
what to think by experts.

45:44.000 --> 45:44.640
And people are sick of being told
what to think by experts.

45:44.680 --> 45:48.120
Well...
Well, have you seen the news?

45:48.160 --> 45:52.000
Europe's stock markets
opened at 8am UK time,

45:52.040 --> 45:55.080
and as expected, it was a bloodbath.

45:58.640 --> 46:00.000
Yes?
NYL took a hit last night.

46:00.000 --> 46:00.680
Yes?
NYL took a hit last night.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.880
It could have been worse.

46:01.920 --> 46:04.120
Huang Capital is buying out
Ellams Automotive.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.000
I knew you were behind
Daunt Tolliver, Dominic.

46:08.000 --> 46:08.520
I knew you were behind
Daunt Tolliver, Dominic.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.240
I'm trying to protect it
from the Chinese.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.160
What are you doing?
Making money for NYL.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.000
What was the one thing
I told you about being a CEO?

46:16.000 --> 46:16.240
What was the one thing
I told you about being a CEO?

46:16.280 --> 46:18.320
It's not about making money.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.160
It's about exercising power.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.960
And you misused yours.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.000
I already told you.
Take 'no' for an answer.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.120
I already told you.
Take 'no' for an answer.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.120
Now what?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.360
...and there were fears
that falls were so big

46:38.400 --> 46:40.000
that the London Stock Exchange
would halt trading.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.240
that the London Stock Exchange
would halt trading.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.640
I heard Stonehouse is flying over.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.200
The shit hasn't even started
hitting the fan here yet.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.000
Where are you going?
Uh, dentist.

46:48.000 --> 46:48.400
Where are you going?
Uh, dentist.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.040
You're quiet.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.000
Massimo fired me.

47:04.000 --> 47:04.040
Massimo fired me.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.840
No...

47:15.440 --> 47:16.520
Good afternoon.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.440
Hi, good afternoon.
I'm Oliver Harris.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.000
I have an appointment
with Mr Talmadge.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.360
I have an appointment
with Mr Talmadge.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.440
Sure, please. Follow me.
Thank you.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.000
Put all that away.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.000
I'm taking you out
and we're going to get shitfaced.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.480
I'm taking you out
and we're going to get shitfaced.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.880
I just want to go through this
polling data one more time.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.400
You don't owe this place
another second of your time.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.440
Damian wouldn't have made
a mistake like this.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.240
Come on.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.360
Maybe you're right.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.400
Oh, it's Damian.
I've gotta take this.

47:48.440 --> 47:51.480
Look, you go. Order me a double.
I'll be right there. OK.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.680
Damian, where the hell
have you been, mate?

47:54.720 --> 47:56.520
Man, I need to tell you something.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.720
Congratulations on making it
to the third round.

48:00.120 --> 48:02.440
We covered process a lot previously.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.040
This time
we'd like to talk about you.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Uh, no problem.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.520
If you get this job...

48:10.560 --> 48:12.360
you'll be the youngest
Head of Trading

48:12.400 --> 48:14.320
that Durings has ever had.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.000
It's a role that comes with
a great deal of responsibility.

48:16.000 --> 48:16.960
It's a role that comes with
a great deal of responsibility.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.480
Now, on a personal level...

48:19.520 --> 48:21.240
are you ready
for that kind of pressure?

48:28.400 --> 48:30.240
Without a shadow of a doubt.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.680
Racial slurs, hate crimes

48:33.720 --> 48:35.920
and Brexit's effect
on its ethnic communities...

48:35.960 --> 48:39.040
Has the unspeakable
received permission to shout?

48:39.080 --> 48:40.000
Multicultural Britain
has never looked so divided.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.760
Multicultural Britain
has never looked so divided.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.720
Following the Brexit vote
there's been a surge in hate crime.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.040
Kalim!

49:00.400 --> 49:04.000
UK police have recorded nearly
6,500 incidents in a 4-week period,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.160
UK police have recorded nearly
6,500 incidents in a 4-week period,

49:05.200 --> 49:07.600
spanning the day of the Brexit vote.

49:07.640 --> 49:10.120
That's an average of 222 a day,

49:10.160 --> 49:12.000
and that's 25%
up on the previous year.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.240
and that's 25%
up on the previous year.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Many incidents, like the one on the
Manchester Metro line last month,

49:20.000 --> 49:21.360
Many incidents, like the one on the
Manchester Metro line last month,

49:21.400 --> 49:23.640
are still under
police investigation.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.200
It's one of 83 hate crimes
recorded by the force in June.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.000
Almost 3 a day,
which involved phrases like,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.360
Almost 3 a day,
which involved phrases like,

49:30.400 --> 49:33.160
"Leave my country",
or "Go back home".

50:31.720 --> 50:32.000
Hi, this is Kalim Chowdry.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.320
Hi, this is Kalim Chowdry.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.560
Leave a message and
I'll call you straight back.

50:48.800 --> 50:49.880
What do you want?

50:53.400 --> 50:54.440
You dropped it.

51:04.720 --> 51:06.440
There's blood on your hands again.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.760
The UK has voted to leave the EU.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.000
They have decided that it is time
to vote to take back control.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.120
They have decided that it is time
to vote to take back control.

51:40.160 --> 51:44.000
June 23rd needs to become
a national bank holiday

51:44.000 --> 51:44.280
June 23rd needs to become
a national bank holiday

51:44.320 --> 51:46.640
and we will call it
Independence Day.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.000
I think it's a fantastic thing.

51:52.000 --> 51:52.200
I think it's a fantastic thing.
