00:02.528 --> 00:04.685
<i>Kids, in April of 2013,</i>

00:04.785 --> 00:06.535
<i>your mother and I were</i>
<i>very close</i>

00:06.537 --> 00:08.153
<i>and yet very far apart.</i>

00:08.154 --> 00:10.756
<i>I was living on</i>
<i>West 82nd Street.</i>

00:10.758 --> 00:12.925
<i>She was up on West 115th.</i>

00:12.927 --> 00:15.493
<i>She was getting</i>
<i>a degree in economics.</i>

00:15.495 --> 00:17.513
<i>I was teaching architecture.</i>

00:17.515 --> 00:18.714
<i>I was always at MacLaren's.</i>

00:18.716 --> 00:20.132
<i>She was always...</i>

00:20.134 --> 00:22.217
<i>not spending</i>
<i>all her time in a bar.</i>

00:22.219 --> 00:25.420
<i>She was dating some</i>
<i>finance guy named Louis.</i>

00:25.422 --> 00:27.439
<i>And I...</i>

00:27.441 --> 00:29.892
<i>I was alone.</i>

00:31.895 --> 00:33.312
Ted, get ready
to be surrounded by

00:33.314 --> 00:35.197
half-naked,
grease-covered bodies.

00:35.199 --> 00:37.733
And by grease,
I mean motor grease.

00:37.735 --> 00:41.153
We're going to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers!</i>

00:41.155 --> 00:44.323
<i>Kids, you remember</i>
Robots vs. Wrestlers.

00:44.325 --> 00:45.240
Forget everything
you remember

00:45.242 --> 00:46.491
about <i>Robots</i>
<i>vs. Wrestlers.</i>

00:46.493 --> 00:50.045
This is <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers:</i>
<i>"Legends."</i>

00:50.047 --> 00:53.298
Elderly wrestlers
fighting old-timey robots

00:53.300 --> 00:55.367
in a wheelchair-accessible
wrestling ring.

00:55.369 --> 00:57.869
Why are we still sitting here?

00:57.871 --> 00:59.087
I got a big lecture tomorrow.

00:59.089 --> 01:00.538
Think I'm gonna
take it easy tonight.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.758
Ted, trust me,
20 years from now,

01:02.760 --> 01:06.445
you'll be glad you saw
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers: Legends.</i>

01:06.447 --> 01:08.981
I can't imagine
a world where that's possible.

01:08.983 --> 01:09.982
I'm serious.

01:09.984 --> 01:11.233
20 years from now,

01:11.235 --> 01:13.602
when my 26-year-old third wife
asks me about this...

01:13.604 --> 01:15.070
You make a lot of those jokes.

01:15.072 --> 01:16.305
I'm gonna say,

01:16.307 --> 01:18.423
"Yeah, it was awesome,
but you know the funny thing?

01:18.425 --> 01:20.442
Ted almost didn't go."
Hmm.

01:20.444 --> 01:22.894
"But thank God he did,
because it was a great night."

01:22.896 --> 01:24.062
And then she
and I will

01:24.064 --> 01:25.397
adjourn to the Jacuzzi,

01:25.399 --> 01:27.399
where my fourth wife
will be waiting for us,

01:27.401 --> 01:28.900
already warming herself
up on the jets.

01:28.902 --> 01:30.619
Oh, Robin's here--
I'll tell you the rest later.

01:30.621 --> 01:32.570
Please do,
that story could go anywhere.

01:32.572 --> 01:33.538
Mwah.

01:33.540 --> 01:34.923
Hey, hello.
Hey.

01:34.925 --> 01:36.041
Here we are
at the bar

01:36.043 --> 01:37.242
once more.

01:38.094 --> 01:39.428
"What will I have to drink?"
you ask.

01:39.430 --> 01:40.462
Hmm.

01:40.464 --> 01:41.579
Minnesota Tidal Wave.

01:41.581 --> 01:43.098
"What's that?" you ask.

01:43.100 --> 01:44.216
Only the best cocktail ever.

01:44.218 --> 01:45.884
"Who invented it?" you ask.

01:46.419 --> 01:47.603
Me.

01:47.605 --> 01:49.271
And it's not
a girly drink.

01:49.273 --> 01:50.689
Lily, why would
you even say that?

01:50.691 --> 01:52.424
Girly drink.

01:52.426 --> 01:54.610
Hey, I am the least
girly girl on Earth,

01:54.612 --> 01:56.395
and I love
the Minnesota Tidal Wave.

01:56.397 --> 01:57.813
Thank you, Robin.

01:57.815 --> 01:59.731
Matter of fact,
I'm going to go order one

01:59.733 --> 02:01.599
right now
with my head held high.

02:01.601 --> 02:02.600
Lily.

02:02.602 --> 02:04.069
You want me to
order it for you?

02:04.071 --> 02:05.270
Yes, please,
thank you, baby.

02:08.858 --> 02:10.993
Ted, let me tell you
the secret to life.

02:10.995 --> 02:12.110
Hmm.

02:12.112 --> 02:13.912
Every time I make a decision
about what to do

02:13.914 --> 02:16.081
on a given night, I ask myself,

02:16.083 --> 02:19.751
"What would make the best memory
20 years from now?"

02:19.753 --> 02:22.955
So I let 20-Years-From-Now-
Barney call the shots.

02:22.957 --> 02:24.289
And it always works out.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.425
And 20-Years-From-Now-Barney

02:26.427 --> 02:28.810
thinks we should go
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

02:28.812 --> 02:29.828
I don't know.

02:29.830 --> 02:30.796
Let's ask him.

02:30.798 --> 02:31.980
Close your eyes, Ted.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.550
Okay, now open them.

02:35.552 --> 02:36.518
Barney, I swear to God,

02:36.520 --> 02:37.969
if I open my eyes
and your bare ass

02:37.971 --> 02:39.521
is an inch away
from my face again...

02:39.523 --> 02:42.007
Just open your eyes.

02:46.079 --> 02:47.896
Ted, I'd like you to meet
20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

02:47.898 --> 02:49.581
20-Years-From-Now-Barney,
you remember Ted.

03:04.514 --> 03:05.847
Hey, Ted.

03:05.849 --> 03:07.065
What's this
I hear-slash-remember

03:07.067 --> 03:10.235
about you not wanting to
see <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

03:10.237 --> 03:12.020
Yeah, it's just that I
don't want to see it.

03:12.022 --> 03:14.022
You don't...
I know.

03:14.024 --> 03:15.107
He doesn't...
I know.

03:16.310 --> 03:20.195
Ted, trust us,
it's gonna be legend--

03:20.197 --> 03:22.397
wait 20 years for it...

03:22.399 --> 03:23.348
...dary!

03:23.350 --> 03:25.784
Legendary!
Legendary!

03:25.786 --> 03:26.902
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna go home.

03:26.904 --> 03:28.036
No, Ted, look.
Come on!

03:28.038 --> 03:29.204
If you don't
believe that

03:29.206 --> 03:30.355
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>

03:30.357 --> 03:31.907
is gonna be
a life-changing event,

03:31.909 --> 03:35.711
maybe you'll believe
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

03:36.830 --> 03:37.846
Whoa.

03:37.848 --> 03:39.214
'Sup?

03:39.216 --> 03:40.198
Wow.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.367
Wow, so many
things all at once.

03:42.369 --> 03:43.868
But most
importantly...

03:43.870 --> 03:45.420
I don't go bald?

03:45.422 --> 03:47.039
Nope.

03:47.041 --> 03:48.223
And neither do I.

03:48.225 --> 03:49.374
Eeh...

03:49.376 --> 03:51.876
Ted, listen to me.

03:51.878 --> 03:54.429
You, listen to you.

03:54.431 --> 03:56.181
Me.

03:56.183 --> 03:58.350
You got to go to <i>Robots</i>
<i>vs. Wrestlers: Legends.</i>

03:58.352 --> 04:00.602
Trust me,
you will regret it if you don't.

04:00.604 --> 04:02.104
So, what,
do I go bald or something?

04:02.106 --> 04:03.221
Is that a toupee?

04:03.223 --> 04:04.222
Ted,

04:04.224 --> 04:05.524
scalp check!
Can't Robin do this?

04:05.526 --> 04:07.109
Come on, you've been
doing it for years.

04:07.111 --> 04:08.443
You know the frame
of reference.

04:08.445 --> 04:09.745
Scalp check!

04:11.330 --> 04:12.748
Hmm, that's odd.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.667
Little early in the week
for scalp check.

04:15.669 --> 04:16.901
Five tablespoons of sugar,

04:16.903 --> 04:19.120
a whisper
of vanilla vodka

04:19.123 --> 04:20.172
and you're done.

04:20.173 --> 04:21.873
Maraschino cherries.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.543
Oh, and a handful of
maraschino cherries on top.

04:24.545 --> 04:26.344
Wait, you're ordering
a Robin Scherbatsky.

04:26.346 --> 04:27.512
Why didn't you just say that?

04:29.349 --> 04:31.183
One second
there, barkeep.

04:31.185 --> 04:32.083
Unless I'm mistaken,

04:32.085 --> 04:33.635
the drink this
lady just ordered

04:33.637 --> 04:36.304
is called the
Minnesota Tidal Wave.

04:36.306 --> 04:38.039
Origin unknown.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.392
Oh, well, you know, Robin's been
ordering them so much lately

04:40.394 --> 04:41.610
that we named it after her.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.678
You named a drink after me?

04:43.680 --> 04:45.113
Right there in the menu.

04:45.115 --> 04:46.431
Congrats.

04:53.706 --> 04:55.957
I can't drink this.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.209
That's better.

04:57.211 --> 04:59.944
I'm still seething,
but that's better.

05:01.131 --> 05:02.631
Okay,
20-Years-From-Now-Me,

05:02.633 --> 05:04.216
level with me.

05:04.218 --> 05:06.718
You. Us.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.503
Is <i>Robots vs.</i>
<i>Wrestlers</i> worth it?

05:08.505 --> 05:11.056
It was the single
greatest night of my life.

05:11.058 --> 05:12.724
Even greater
than your wedding?

05:12.726 --> 05:14.860
Well, I mean,
when I get married,

05:14.862 --> 05:16.511
that'll be the
greatest night of my life.

05:16.513 --> 05:18.180
But who knows when
that's going to happen?

05:18.182 --> 05:20.315
Oh, my God, you
still haven't...

05:20.317 --> 05:21.800
Man, I hope
I meet her soon.

05:21.802 --> 05:23.652
Oh, God, what is
wrong with me?!

05:23.654 --> 05:25.020
I'm sorry!

05:25.022 --> 05:26.655
I'm just messing
with you!

05:26.657 --> 05:28.857
Now, come on, are
we going or what?

05:28.859 --> 05:30.575
Fine, let's go.

05:30.577 --> 05:31.776
Yeah!

05:32.612 --> 05:34.079
Not so fast.

05:34.081 --> 05:36.798
Barney, Ted,
20-Years-From-Now-Barney,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.099
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

05:38.101 --> 05:38.934
Who are you?

05:38.936 --> 05:41.720
I'm 20-Hours-From-Now-Ted.

05:41.722 --> 05:44.322
And you bastards
aren't going anywhere.

05:49.578 --> 05:51.776
So, you're the Ted
from 20 hours from now?

05:51.876 --> 05:52.859
Shh.

05:52.861 --> 05:55.445
Just... shh.

05:55.447 --> 05:56.529
You okay?

05:56.531 --> 05:58.131
No, I'm not okay.

05:58.133 --> 06:00.750
This dummy's about to go
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers--</i>

06:00.752 --> 06:02.368
and yes, it'll be awesome...

06:02.370 --> 06:04.487
See?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.571
...at first.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.206
But then
you're gonna drink way too much,

06:07.208 --> 06:09.158
hence the headache.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.460
Then you're gonna
jump into the ring

06:10.462 --> 06:12.628
and sprain your wrist,
hence the splint.

06:12.630 --> 06:13.679
And then afterwards,
you're gonna smoke

06:13.681 --> 06:14.997
half a pack of cigarettes,
hence the...

06:16.167 --> 06:18.301
Well, that's the sound
a good time.

06:18.303 --> 06:20.803
And 20 hours from now,
when you're me,

06:20.805 --> 06:21.804
you're gonna want
to come back here,

06:21.806 --> 06:24.390
right to this very spot,
right now,

06:24.392 --> 06:26.008
and smack yourself
upside the head.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.477
Yeah, but obviously
I wouldn't do that

06:27.479 --> 06:28.644
'cause I'd only be
smacking myself--

06:28.646 --> 06:30.346
Ow!

06:30.348 --> 06:33.599
Don't do this to me, Ted.
Don't do this to us.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.535
Don't listen to yourself,
Present-Day-Ted.

06:35.537 --> 06:38.654
It's a day of pain
for a lifetime of memories.

06:38.656 --> 06:40.289
20-Hours-From-Now-Me,

06:40.291 --> 06:43.409
just tell me one
thing: do I hurl?

06:43.411 --> 06:45.578
Yeah, kid.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.213
You hurl.

06:47.215 --> 06:48.364
A lot?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.083
Remember when Mom

06:50.085 --> 06:52.418
bought the beef
from the Price Club?

06:52.420 --> 06:54.504
Okay, how about this:

06:54.506 --> 06:56.722
we go to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>

06:56.724 --> 06:59.642
but I don't
drink too much?

06:59.644 --> 07:00.960
Interesting.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.978
I'm good with that.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.212
No, forget it.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.647
If Ted
doesn't get wasted,

07:04.649 --> 07:06.182
there's no way
he'll end up making out

07:06.184 --> 07:08.651
with that surprisingly
realistic-looking female robot.

07:08.653 --> 07:10.553
Wait, I kiss
a female robot?

07:10.555 --> 07:12.021
Oh, you do a lot
more than that.

07:12.023 --> 07:15.191
Now, look, nobody is
saying you need alcohol

07:15.193 --> 07:17.160
to have an exciting
and memorable night.

07:17.162 --> 07:19.245
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

07:19.247 --> 07:21.998
But in this case, yeah,
you kind of have to be wasted.

07:24.285 --> 07:26.002
You drink beers
in cans still.

07:26.004 --> 07:27.620
It makes the robot scarier.

07:28.505 --> 07:30.256
They named
my drink after her.

07:30.258 --> 07:31.624
The Minnesota Tidal Wave.

07:31.626 --> 07:32.875
It's my usual.

07:32.877 --> 07:34.093
Immaterial!

07:34.095 --> 07:35.711
If it's gonna be named
after anybody,

07:35.713 --> 07:37.513
it should be called
The Marshall Eriksen.

07:37.515 --> 07:39.599
Sorry, it's
The Robin Scherbatsky.

07:39.601 --> 07:40.749
Read it and weep.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.418
Oh, so you're gonna
Zuckerberg me?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.352
That it?

07:43.354 --> 07:44.753
You're Zuckerberging me?

07:44.755 --> 07:45.454
That's fine.

07:45.456 --> 07:47.106
I'll see you in court.

07:47.108 --> 07:49.158
Little court known
as the dance floor.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.693
Dance-off. Now.

07:50.695 --> 07:51.760
No, no dancing.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.596
Marshall,
we've been through this.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.598
The doctor said your
dancer's hip is worse than ever.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.617
You have to lay off dancing
for a while.

07:57.619 --> 07:59.452
You're killing me, Lily!

07:59.454 --> 08:01.487
You're killing me!

08:01.489 --> 08:02.605
I'm an adult.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.123
You have to let me dance
my own battles.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.875
Marshall, there's not gonna be
a dance-off

08:05.877 --> 08:07.109
because the name is staying.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.445
Period, end of story.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.632
I just like having
my name on something.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.050
Oh, you do?

08:14.052 --> 08:16.085
Oh, that's great, Robin.

08:16.087 --> 08:18.087
Then that's what you will get.

08:18.089 --> 08:20.173
That's...

08:20.175 --> 08:22.175
what you...

08:22.177 --> 08:24.560
will get.

08:26.129 --> 08:28.598
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.316
Oh, hey, Robin.

08:30.318 --> 08:32.301
You here "for a good time"?

08:32.303 --> 08:34.236
Classic.

08:34.239 --> 08:35.804
Did you write my number
in the men's room?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.107
It...
Well, I don't know.

08:38.109 --> 08:39.642
I guess you'll never know
unless you go in there,

08:39.644 --> 08:40.775
which I highly
doubt that...

08:40.778 --> 08:42.111
There she goes.

08:42.113 --> 08:43.645
Okay, boys.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.482
Close your eyes
and zip your flies.

08:52.372 --> 08:54.657
Hi. Don't mind me.

08:57.377 --> 08:59.011
I don't think
you should have done that.

08:59.013 --> 09:01.297
Lily, I know what I'm doing,
all right?

09:01.299 --> 09:02.431
I'm a lawyer.

09:02.433 --> 09:04.050
I've thought about
every possible scenario.

09:04.052 --> 09:05.551
I'm ten steps ahead of...

09:08.004 --> 09:09.639
Where's she going?

09:09.641 --> 09:11.057
Probably into the ladies' room

09:11.059 --> 09:12.675
to write something on the wall
about you.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.060
Nobody writes things

09:14.062 --> 09:15.361
on the walls
of the ladies' room.

09:15.363 --> 09:17.029
Have you been
in the ladies' room?

09:17.031 --> 09:18.447
Of course not.

09:18.449 --> 09:21.350
Lily, I know that I have the
sexual charisma of a bad boy,

09:21.352 --> 09:24.737
but I certainly don't have
the manners of one.

09:26.073 --> 09:27.022
What'd you write in there?

09:27.024 --> 09:29.158
Why don't you
go in and look?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.360
You know I can't do that, Robin.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.545
Lily, can you go look?

09:32.547 --> 09:35.915
Oh, I thought you wanted
to dance your own battles.

09:37.050 --> 09:39.585
Ladies,
put your blouses back on!

09:39.587 --> 09:42.672
I'm coming in!

09:47.261 --> 09:48.644
<i>Dear Marshall,</i>

09:48.646 --> 09:50.746
<i>I know this is a strange way</i>
<i>to apologize,</i>

09:50.748 --> 09:54.150
<i>but I'm sorry I let Carl</i>
<i>name your drink after me.</i>

09:54.152 --> 09:55.818
<i>Why didn't I say something?</i>

09:55.820 --> 09:58.387
<i>Gosh, I guess that goes back</i>
<i>to my childhood.</i>

09:59.740 --> 10:01.057
Okay, guys.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.076
Let's go to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

10:04.078 --> 10:04.944
Huzzah!
Now you're talking!

10:04.946 --> 10:05.894
Here we go.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.163
Nope, sit down.

10:07.165 --> 10:08.664
Everybody sit down.

10:08.666 --> 10:09.749
Okay, who are you?

10:09.751 --> 10:12.702
Hello, Ted, Barney,
20-Hours-From-Now-Ted,

10:12.704 --> 10:14.920
20-Years-From-Now-Ted,
20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

10:14.922 --> 10:16.422
Hey, how's it going?

10:16.424 --> 10:18.374
Allow me to introduce myself.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.543
I'm 20-Minutes-From-Now-Barney,

10:20.545 --> 10:22.378
and I have got something
very important to...

10:23.464 --> 10:25.548
What's the stain
on your shirt, bro?

10:25.550 --> 10:27.767
Please, please, I really do have
something very important to...

10:28.936 --> 10:30.919
You look stupid.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.254
Here's your spaghetti.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.056
And be careful...

10:35.609 --> 10:37.310
...with the meatball.

10:39.446 --> 10:41.864
<i>And that's the only time</i>
<i>my father</i>

10:41.866 --> 10:43.599
<i>ever said he was proud of me.</i>

10:43.601 --> 10:46.535
<i>Maybe that's why I stole credit</i>
<i>for your drink.</i>

10:46.537 --> 10:47.620
<i>Maybe that's why</i>

10:47.622 --> 10:50.289
<i>I needed to pour my heart out</i>
<i>like this.</i>

10:50.291 --> 10:52.925
<i>Or, maybe I wrote this</i>
<i>so you'd be in here long enough</i>

10:52.927 --> 10:55.294
<i>for a lady to walk in,</i>
<i>causing you to freak out</i>

10:55.296 --> 10:56.479
<i>and hide in the stall.</i>

10:57.665 --> 10:59.415
So, you got a text message?
Yeah.

11:02.886 --> 11:03.952
Whoa.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.023
Try to get some
in your mouth next time.

11:07.025 --> 11:09.091
Okay, everybody, listen up.

11:09.093 --> 11:10.159
When I walked in here,

11:10.161 --> 11:11.694
I was 20-Minutes-
From-Now-Barney.

11:11.696 --> 11:13.162
But that was 19 minutes

11:13.164 --> 11:14.697
and some serious
acid reflux--

11:14.699 --> 11:17.500
who orders spaghetti
at an Irish bar?-- ago.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.634
Now,

11:18.636 --> 11:20.319
I'm 20-Seconds-
From-Now-Barney,

11:20.321 --> 11:22.321
and I'm telling you,
watch that door.

11:22.323 --> 11:23.155
Why?

11:23.157 --> 11:26.258
That's why.

11:27.627 --> 11:29.395
Um, oh.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.314
In-in, like,
12 seconds.

11:34.334 --> 11:36.252
Your skin looks great.

11:36.254 --> 11:37.703
Thanks.

11:37.705 --> 11:40.005
And thank you for taking
such good care of it.

11:40.007 --> 11:41.156
Shh.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.958
That's why.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:53.409 --> 11:54.409
Who is that?

11:54.411 --> 11:55.677
She's the coat check girl

11:55.679 --> 11:57.979
from that dance club
we went to seven years ago.

11:57.981 --> 11:59.314
You remember that night.

11:59.316 --> 12:00.765
When Barney grinded
with his cousin.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.685
Oh, man, you remember that
20 years from now?

12:03.687 --> 12:05.653
He won't let anyone forget.

12:05.655 --> 12:06.788
Coat check girl.

12:06.790 --> 12:09.140
I always meant to go
back to that club

12:09.142 --> 12:11.309
and get her number,
but I didn't.

12:11.311 --> 12:13.428
And now she's here?

12:13.430 --> 12:16.731
She's in this bar
seven years later?

12:16.733 --> 12:18.616
I-I can't believe this.

12:18.618 --> 12:20.869
So, wait, do you guys think
I should go talk to her?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.537
Are you kidding me?
Yes, go...

12:22.539 --> 12:23.604
How many different ways...
Idiot.

12:23.606 --> 12:26.658
Hello?

12:26.660 --> 12:29.711
Is anybody out there?

12:32.131 --> 12:34.916
Sounds like the coast is clear.

12:38.671 --> 12:40.621
No, no, wait!

12:40.623 --> 12:41.622
Please, it's not my fault!

12:41.624 --> 12:42.841
I was tricked!

12:42.843 --> 12:44.175
Not cool, Marshall.

12:44.177 --> 12:45.643
This is a nice bar.

12:45.645 --> 12:47.846
Girls come here, they just want
to relax with their friends,

12:47.848 --> 12:50.148
maybe have
a few Robin Scherbatskys,

12:50.150 --> 12:51.632
and not have to
worry out some guy

12:51.634 --> 12:54.686
pulling a Marshall Eriksen
in the bathroom.

12:54.688 --> 12:57.655
No, no, no, I know. I just...

12:57.657 --> 13:01.476
Wait a minute,
did you just use my name

13:01.478 --> 13:03.661
as shorthand
for a guy being creepy?

13:03.663 --> 13:04.746
Yep.

13:04.748 --> 13:06.147
Well, you know what, Carl?

13:06.149 --> 13:07.866
I think that you are making

13:07.868 --> 13:09.701
a broad
and prejudicial assumption.

13:09.703 --> 13:12.087
So next time I meet a guy
who just goes around

13:12.089 --> 13:13.654
rushing to judgment,
I'm gonna say,

13:13.656 --> 13:16.875
"Hey, that guy's being
a real Carl..."

13:18.827 --> 13:21.346
You don't know my last name.

13:21.348 --> 13:23.348
You've been drinking
here for years,

13:23.350 --> 13:24.632
and you don't know my last name.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.936
I will name every drink
in this bar after you

13:27.938 --> 13:30.105
if you can tell me my last name.

13:30.107 --> 13:31.189
Well, that just seems confusing.

13:31.191 --> 13:33.141
How will you know
what people are ordering?

13:34.143 --> 13:35.477
What's my last name, Marshall?

13:35.479 --> 13:37.612
It's Carl...

13:43.035 --> 13:44.536
...'s Junior.

13:45.571 --> 13:47.455
Okay, wish me luck,
everyone.

13:47.457 --> 13:49.690
Break a leg...

13:57.967 --> 14:00.218
What the hell?

14:01.703 --> 14:03.221
Do not talk to her.

14:03.223 --> 14:04.556
What-what... Who are you?

14:04.558 --> 14:07.208
We are 20-Months-From-Now-
Coat-Check-Girl.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.426
But there's two of you.

14:08.428 --> 14:10.728
Right, because if you go
over there and you talk to her,

14:10.730 --> 14:12.764
20 months from now, it's gonna
end in one of two ways.

14:12.766 --> 14:14.599
Either you are gonna
get sick of me.

14:14.601 --> 14:16.017
I made you muffins

14:16.019 --> 14:18.553
because of your
nickname: Muffin.

14:18.555 --> 14:20.188
Or...

14:20.190 --> 14:22.574
I am gonna get sick of you
and your stupid habits.

14:22.576 --> 14:24.659
Stop DVR-ing the news.
You're never gonna catch up.

14:24.661 --> 14:25.693
Oh, stop it,

14:25.695 --> 14:27.095
you're scaring him off.

14:27.097 --> 14:28.913
By the way,
I'm pregnant.

14:28.915 --> 14:30.114
No, she's not.

14:30.116 --> 14:31.199
Okay, no, I'm not,

14:31.201 --> 14:33.117
but that made you happy
for a second, right?

14:33.902 --> 14:35.386
Please shut up.
Okay, wait,

14:35.388 --> 14:38.206
so you're saying
it's doomed completely?

14:38.208 --> 14:41.092
One of us is just guaranteed
to get sick of the other

14:41.094 --> 14:42.677
and call it quits?

14:42.679 --> 14:44.579
You've been dating
for a long time, Ted.

14:44.581 --> 14:47.232
Has it ever gone
any other way?

15:09.206 --> 15:10.288
Look at this one.

15:10.290 --> 15:11.439
Thank you so much.

15:11.441 --> 15:12.657
Hey.

15:12.659 --> 15:14.142
Hey, you look kind of down.

15:14.144 --> 15:17.662
Have a Robin Scherbatsky,
on me.

15:17.664 --> 15:20.448
None of this would have happened
if Lily had let me dance.

15:22.135 --> 15:24.752
Baby, wait.

15:24.754 --> 15:26.087
God, you're still clinging
to that?

15:26.089 --> 15:27.555
Marshall, it doesn't matter,

15:27.557 --> 15:29.841
'cause you'd lose anyway,
and you know why?

15:29.843 --> 15:31.759
'Cause I'm Sparkles,
bitch.

15:31.761 --> 15:33.928
Oh, and you think
you can step to me?

15:33.930 --> 15:35.897
You think you can step
up to the streets?

15:35.899 --> 15:37.181
To me?

15:37.183 --> 15:40.602
You think you can step up
over me to the streets?

15:40.604 --> 15:42.487
I guess we'll never know
because you are not allowed...

15:42.489 --> 15:43.471
Wait, wait.

15:44.807 --> 15:47.442
That's my jam.

15:47.444 --> 15:49.360
Who's playing my jam?

16:12.102 --> 16:13.384
I understand.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.103
What, you're not gonna try
and stop me?

16:15.105 --> 16:17.272
And how would I try
and stop you?

16:17.274 --> 16:20.608
I don't know, by telling me
life is short,

16:20.610 --> 16:22.610
and if you ever come
across a beautiful,

16:22.612 --> 16:24.195
exciting, crazy moment in it,

16:24.197 --> 16:26.281
you got to seize it
while you can

16:26.283 --> 16:27.682
before that moment's gone?

16:27.684 --> 16:31.069
Ted, this moment
already is gone.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.855
The whole
Minnesota Tidal Wave thing

16:33.857 --> 16:35.239
happened five years ago.

16:35.241 --> 16:36.624
It's just a memory.

16:36.626 --> 16:37.792
And the rest of this

16:37.794 --> 16:39.410
never happened.

16:39.412 --> 16:41.963
Right now, Marshall
and Lily are upstairs,

16:41.965 --> 16:43.881
trying to get Marvin
to go back to sleep.

16:43.883 --> 16:46.000
Robin and I are trying
to decide on a caterer.

16:46.002 --> 16:47.085
And you've been
sitting here

16:47.087 --> 16:49.120
all night,
staring at a single ticket

16:49.122 --> 16:50.805
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>

16:50.807 --> 16:52.540
because the rest of us
couldn't come out.

16:52.542 --> 16:55.443
Look around, Ted.

16:55.445 --> 16:57.578
You're all alone.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.188
<i>Kids, it's been almost 20 years</i>

17:07.190 --> 17:10.074

<i>and I can safely tell you,</i>

17:11.894 --> 17:15.496
<i>if I could go back in time</i>
<i>and relive that night,</i>

17:15.498 --> 17:19.701
<i>there's no way in hell</i>
<i>I'd go to</i> Robots vs. Wrestlers.

17:22.237 --> 17:25.839
<i>No, I'd go home.</i>

17:25.842 --> 17:27.709
<i>I'd go to my old apartment,</i>

17:27.711 --> 17:30.428
<i>see all my old furniture,</i>
<i>my old stuff.</i>

17:30.430 --> 17:32.547
<i>I'd see my old drafting table,</i>

17:32.549 --> 17:35.550
<i>where I sketched out</i>
<i>my first building.</i>

17:35.552 --> 17:36.917
<i>I'd sit on that old couch</i>

17:36.919 --> 17:39.604
<i>and smell the Indian food</i>
<i>cooking three stories below.</i>

17:39.606 --> 17:42.923
<i>I'd go to Lily</i>
<i>and Marshall's place,</i>

17:42.925 --> 17:45.810
<i>be back in that old living room</i>
<i>where so many things happened.</i>

17:45.812 --> 17:47.261
<i>I'd see the baby.</i>

17:47.263 --> 17:49.197
<i>I don't know if you can</i>
<i>picture me holding</i>

17:49.199 --> 17:51.983
<i>your six-foot-seven</i>
<i>cousin Marvin over my head,</i>

17:51.985 --> 17:54.152
<i>but back then I could.</i>

17:54.154 --> 17:56.287
<i>I'd go have a drink</i>
<i>with Barney and Robin,</i>

17:56.289 --> 17:58.156
<i>watch them fight</i>
<i>about their caterer</i>

17:58.158 --> 18:00.658
<i>or whatever it was they were</i>
<i>fighting about that night.</i>

18:00.660 --> 18:03.944
<i>But none of those things</i>
<i>is the thing I'd do first.</i>

18:03.946 --> 18:07.999
<i>You know the thing</i>
<i>I'd do first?</i>

18:33.075 --> 18:35.076
Hi.

18:36.912 --> 18:40.147
I'm Ted Mosby.

18:40.149 --> 18:43.984
And exactly 45 days from now,

18:43.986 --> 18:46.671
you and I are gonna meet,

18:46.673 --> 18:49.090
and we're gonna fall in love,

18:49.092 --> 18:51.008
and we're gonna get married,

18:51.010 --> 18:54.512
and...
we're gonna have two kids.

18:54.514 --> 18:58.599
And we're gonna love them
and each other so much.

19:01.437 --> 19:04.138
All that is 45 days away.

19:07.392 --> 19:10.228
But I'm here now,

19:10.230 --> 19:13.314
I guess, because...

19:15.701 --> 19:19.320
I want those extra 45 days
with you.

19:19.322 --> 19:22.790
I want each one of them.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.709
Look, and if I can't have them,

19:24.711 --> 19:27.211
I'll take the 45 seconds
before your boyfriend shows up

19:27.213 --> 19:30.381
and punches me in the face,

19:30.383 --> 19:33.551
because...

19:33.553 --> 19:35.753
I love you.

19:35.755 --> 19:38.806
I'm always gonna love you,

19:38.808 --> 19:42.677
till the end of my days
and beyond.

19:44.513 --> 19:46.430
You'll see.

19:47.766 --> 19:49.600
Can I help you?

19:49.602 --> 19:52.353
Oh, hey, it's, uh, Louis, right?

19:52.355 --> 19:53.371
It's okay.

19:53.373 --> 19:54.655
It's fine, um...

19:54.657 --> 19:56.190
I'm in love
with your girlfriend,

19:56.192 --> 19:58.058
and, uh,
we're gonna get married.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.111
What?
Yeah.

20:25.171 --> 20:27.744
Okay, guys, I've been waiting
20 years for this.

20:27.844 --> 20:29.227
Just like we practiced.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.562
No mistakes, ready?

20:30.564 --> 20:33.314

a-one, two, three, four.
