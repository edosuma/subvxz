00:07.680 --> 00:09.967
- ( Screams )
- Hello.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.365
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm your new best friend.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.610
He's behind all this.
Maybe we could help each other out.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.364
Let's get this motherfucker.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.601
- Oh, shit!
- His real hand.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.683
I hope your weird brujo uncle
can help us out.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.120
I'll look inside of you.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.930
You want me
to take an acid trip?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.360
Oh, no, you--

00:36.520 --> 00:38.648
Uh, everything all right in there?

00:41.400 --> 00:44.006
Who's fucking
with who now, huh?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.371
Kelly: And then he started
speaking in tongues,

00:58.520 --> 01:00.409
and it looked like
he was having a seizure,

01:00.560 --> 01:02.642
and then that's when
he grabbed me by the throat

01:02.800 --> 01:04.404
and started to strangle me.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.608
And the name of this demon,
are you sure it was Eligos?

01:06.760 --> 01:09.127
I'm positive because
he said it just like that.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.248
He said, "I am Eligos."

01:11.400 --> 01:13.607
And that was right before
his eyes went completely black,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.087
and then you guys came in,
thank God.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.562
( Muffled ) Fuckin' A, what a story.
What a fucking bullshit story that is.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.489
- Oh, my God.
- Ash: I would've never...

01:21.680 --> 01:24.047
it must've gotten inside Ash
back at the bookstore.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.362
And that's why we
never fool with demons.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.607
Your Uncle Esteban
fooled with demons

01:27.760 --> 01:29.285
and look what
happened to him.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.961
( Muffled )
Disgusting.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.121
I just don't understand
why we didn't see it sooner.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.401
( Muffled )
Nothing to see.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.050
- Eligos is the demon of the mind.
- Ash: Yeah, he is.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.651
- He's a manipulator.
- Ash: Uh-huh.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.404
He ensnared your friend
after the summoning

01:42.560 --> 01:44.164
and slowly worked
deep into his brain

01:44.320 --> 01:46.482
until the vision quest
popped him up to fruition.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.722
( Muffled )
No! there's nobody inside of me.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.763
You must be right.
I mean, look at how

01:50.960 --> 01:52.325
he's reacting to what you say.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.686
'Cause you're fucking lying
through your teeth!

01:53.880 --> 01:56.281
Pablo, take Kelly,
get me boiling water,

01:56.440 --> 01:58.249
chicken, and my 10-inch Ginsu.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.165
The one with the carving blade,
not the bread knife.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.651
Ash: What the fuck
you gonna do with that?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.245
- Okay.
- Hey, repitemelo.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.970
Uh...

02:06.120 --> 02:07.963
- Not the bread knife.
- Okay, good.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.681
The bread knife was expensive.
I don't wanna ruin it.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.684
Oye, tio,
ese mi amigo.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.444
What are you gonna do
to Ash, huh?

02:16.600 --> 02:18.250
I'm going to try to
exorcise this monster

02:18.400 --> 02:19.890
- before it is too late.
- With a knife?

02:20.040 --> 02:21.804
If it comes to that, yes.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.200
( Muffled )
With a fucking knife?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.569
I'm sorry, I just wanna be 100% here--
you're gonna cut Ash with a knife?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.041
What kind of fucking
witch doctor are you, man?

02:29.200 --> 02:31.646
Possessions can be physical
as well as spiritual.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.564
For example,
there's a lobe in the brain

02:33.720 --> 02:35.449
where such demons
can be festering.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.762
The lobe can be removed.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.445
All he's gonna lose
is just his sense of smell

02:39.600 --> 02:41.523
and any feeling of pleasure
from the waist down.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.371
( Muffled ) What?
You're cutting my balls off?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.010
- Oh, no.
- Okay, what happens

02:46.160 --> 02:48.811
if you can't get the demon
out that way, huh?

02:48.960 --> 02:52.169
Then I will do
what I must. Okay?

02:52.320 --> 02:55.164
( Speaking Spanish )

03:00.000 --> 03:02.844
( deep voice )
Your soul will be mine.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.287
I'm sorry, Ash.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.361
Her eyes just went black.
Do you hear me?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.170
She's a fucking demon!

03:11.320 --> 03:13.402
( Music playing )

03:23.360 --> 03:24.407
Pablo:
I'm not a little kid, yeah--

03:24.560 --> 03:26.722
it's, like, oh, yeah,
go get this boiling water

03:26.880 --> 03:29.565
and, uh, chicken carcass
and the Ginsu knife.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.848
Man, he took every single one
of those items

03:32.000 --> 03:33.570
without even looking at me once.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.006
- Pablo.
- I mean, this is shitty.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.322
It's, like, I feel like
I'm the sous-chef

03:37.480 --> 03:40.086
- of his exorcism kitchen.
- Pablo.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.611
Oh, man, exorcisms
are the worst.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.650
This is bad. My Uncle Esteban
had an exorcism once,

03:44.800 --> 03:46.609
and that shit
was straight-up scary.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.250
- Pablo!
- Whoa!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.289
You need to calm down.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.726
How? Can you tell me?

03:51.880 --> 03:53.609
How can we be calm
when Ash is clearly--

03:53.760 --> 03:55.888
Ash is the one who
wanted to summon the demon

03:56.040 --> 03:58.725
in the first place, right?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.126
Yeah.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.760
You trust the brujo,
don't you?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.001
Yeah.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.401
Then you need to let him do
what he does best.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.930
And what we need to do
is just stay calm.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.007
- We need a drink.
- Alcohol?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.969
Right now.
You want alcohol right now?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.201
Well, why not?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.483
Nothing we can do
until the brujo is finished with Ash.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.369
Well, what do you mean "finished"?

04:24.520 --> 04:27.490
You know... healed.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.130
Right.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.931
Any idea where
he keeps his stuff?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.802
Man girdle. Okay.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.491
Extra large love gloves.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.449
<i>Gross.</i>

04:45.120 --> 04:47.327
Weed.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.801
Ash was holdin' out on us, huh?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.450
It is not bad.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.244
Yeah. I don't know
that, um, getting high

04:53.400 --> 04:55.482
is the best plan for right now.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.928
It is absolutely the best plan.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.966
Go find us a pipe,
por favor.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.450

♪ Oh, help me, Jesus... ♪

05:25.160 --> 05:26.844
This is some bullshit.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.684
Just relax.
It's gonna take a minute.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.330
There's a killer on the loose,
and I'm sitting here waiting

05:30.480 --> 05:32.482
for this decomposed hand
to lead me to him.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.331
And, by the way,
I'm not in the mood to relax.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.682
Okay, how's
the possession work, anyway?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.366
And how does Ash
create those things?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.010
I used to be like you.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.730
What is that supposed to mean?

05:45.880 --> 05:48.406
I used to think
everything had to be orderly.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.403
Logical.
It should make sense

05:50.560 --> 05:52.210
the way I thought
it should make sense.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.044
So you don't believe
that things should make sense?

05:54.200 --> 05:57.841
Amanda, you know
how respiration works?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.963
Air travels

06:02.000 --> 06:03.923

06:08.520 --> 06:09.931
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.050
'Cause you were not concerned
about the logic of things.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.885

06:55.880 --> 06:59.646
Uh... well, it seems
like it's dangerous.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.202

07:10.760 --> 07:13.240
Okay, full disclosure--
weed makes me really paranoid.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.244
So why don't I just
go have a, um, Mountain Dew?

07:16.400 --> 07:19.006
I'll pound that, and it'll
just give me a really nice buzz--

07:19.160 --> 07:22.289
Come on. Just one hit.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.282
I'll make it worth your while.

Yeah. O-okay.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.320
That sounds good.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.122
So, I think I know
what's happening here,

07:44.280 --> 07:47.250
and, um, I, um...

07:47.440 --> 07:50.967
I've been-- I've been--
I've been wanting to, um...

07:51.120 --> 07:55.444
get closer to you
for a really long time now, so--

07:55.600 --> 07:56.806
( gasps )

07:58.160 --> 08:00.242
How close?

08:03.040 --> 08:06.010
Like really close.
Like, you know, more than friends.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.969
Is that something that you want?

08:10.200 --> 08:11.406
Yes.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.165
Brujo:
Tell me, Eligos,

08:22.320 --> 08:25.529
how do you feel
about sanctified charms?

08:32.520 --> 08:33.567
Huh.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.041
They usually inspire
more rage than that.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.368
On to the blood ritual, then.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.842
I just-- I just wanna make sure that
we're on the same page, you know,

08:42.039 --> 08:43.849
like, I'm just--
I'm just checking in, you know?

08:44.039 --> 08:46.964
Making sure that you're heard
and-- and-- and

08:47.120 --> 08:49.122
you wanna be with me, right?

08:49.280 --> 08:52.363
Like boyfriend-girlfriend--
same milk shake, different straws.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.727
Maybe share a pussy... cat.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.726
Yes, I wanna be with you.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.641
Bad.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.121
Uh, 'cause, you know,

09:05.280 --> 09:07.442
I can see what's inside
of you, Kelly,

09:07.600 --> 09:09.762
and I want you to know
that I think it's beautiful.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.843
(giggles)

09:12.000 --> 09:17.723
What's inside of me
cannot wait to tear you up.

09:19.880 --> 09:24.408
Now... stop wasting time.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.567
Oh, do you remember
the first time we met?

09:29.720 --> 09:32.087
You knocked on my door
and you asked me, uh,

09:32.240 --> 09:35.801
for some cold medicine
'cause you were all sn-- snotty.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.440
And then you sneezed on me.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.365
I wanted to kiss you
that day so bad.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.443

09:44.680 --> 09:46.887
Oh, you.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.725
You are just so sweet.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.167
Now, take a hit.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.762
And then after you do,

09:55.920 --> 09:59.402
you can kiss me...

09:59.560 --> 10:03.610
anywhere you want.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.651
What about right there?
Boop.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.326
You wanna kiss my forehead?

10:10.480 --> 10:13.006
Well, most guys would look past it.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.970
Fine. Just take a hit.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.281
Okay. Um...

10:19.440 --> 10:21.886
oh, hey, how about we, um,
you know, set the mood a little bit?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.166
I know this really great
Taylor Swift song you prob--

10:23.320 --> 10:25.561
Shh!
No, no.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.121
- Put your mouth on it.
- Oh, God.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.763
Actually, you know...

10:36.520 --> 10:38.090
I guess I'm just not sure
if I'm ready.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.327

I'm not a demon.

- Pablo.
- I can't.

(growling )

12:44.720 --> 12:46.210
Oh, shit!

12:46.360 --> 12:49.807
When you get back to hell,
work on your aim.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.644
( Eerie whispers in Spanish )

12:51.800 --> 12:55.282
The sanctified water will do it.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.285
( Distorted voice )
Your charms won't save you!

13:19.400 --> 13:20.890
( Chanting in Spanish )

13:21.040 --> 13:23.566
-( hissing )
- ( growling )

13:25.520 --> 13:27.841
( chanting continues )

13:33.240 --> 13:34.651
" Qut!

13:43.120 --> 13:46.044
(growling )

13:46.200 --> 13:49.010
( groans )

13:52.000 --> 13:54.367
Well, we've all been there.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.562
(whimpering )
Where am I?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.887
Do it again!

14:18.840 --> 14:20.763
All of it.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.008
Kelly, it's me.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.528
Do you want to do it this time?

14:28.720 --> 14:33.248
You wanna hear me moan,
don't you?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.209
(growling )

14:37.720 --> 14:40.371
( gasps, screams )

14:40.560 --> 14:41.721
(laughing)

14:41.880 --> 14:44.326
Ash:
The girl has suffered enough.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.244
Stop! Stop!

14:54.480 --> 14:56.687
Kel...

14:59.080 --> 15:01.242
- Yes!
- You gotta fight it!

15:03.560 --> 15:05.881
-( laughs )
- Stop! I know you're in there.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.361
Look at me.
You can do it, Kelly.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.251
It's me. You can do it, Kel.
Please, please fight it, Kel.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.770
There is no Kelly anymore!

15:16.920 --> 15:19.321
<i>30m! -</i>

15:19.520 --> 15:20.965
You're lying.
Kelly, I know you're in there.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.088
- Pablo, Pablo.
- Please!

15:23.240 --> 15:24.924
Fear only makes
the demon stronger.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.241
Yeah, you think?

15:26.440 --> 15:28.568
This one's for you.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.083
Pablo, the girl--

15:33.280 --> 15:34.930
This is all my fault.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.169
I should've never let them
summon that demon.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.130
This is what I get
for walking away from my calling.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.090
I'm sorry, tio.
I'm-- I'm sorry about everything.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.208
- Please.
- I know you're sorry.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.601
And I am sorry, too,
for pushing you away.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.325
But perhaps
you were meant to leave.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.482
Ash has the light of the jefe
inside of him.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.842
Deep, deep inside.
So deep.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.241
And somehow you still found him.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.651
Ash.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.370
This demon is never coming out.

16:12.600 --> 16:17.242
Please. There's only one way
to put an end to all this, Ash,

16:17.400 --> 16:21.041
- and you know it.
- What are you talking about?

16:21.200 --> 16:22.804
You have to kill me.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.321
The demon's gonna do it anyway.

16:27.480 --> 16:32.008
Please. Hey...

16:32.160 --> 16:33.844
it's okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.765
Just put a cross
on my grave, okay?

16:43.320 --> 16:44.810
Kelly's Jewish.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.006
FUCK you!

16:51.040 --> 16:55.090
( Demon's voice )
Oh, can't blame a demon for trying.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.329
The demon is taunting us by slowly
and painfully killing the host.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.165
The only choice we have
is whether to finish her quickly

17:01.320 --> 17:05.040
or let the demon tear her apart
right in front of our eyes.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.849
Or we give the demon
another host.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.246
What?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.164
The demon wants someone
who's vulnerable

17:10.319 --> 17:11.731
and isn't gonna fight back.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.251
No.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.365
Pablo, stop.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.887
She's gone too far.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.044
I could lose you again.
We've done everything we can.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.929
Hi, sweetie.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.050
Take me instead.
Take me!

17:30.200 --> 17:31.531
I'm a willing host,

17:31.680 --> 17:33.444
and you'll get no fight
from inside of me.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.806
Pablo, it's no use.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.440
I take her place.
I command you now!

17:37.600 --> 17:39.728
-(snafls)
- Oh, shit!

17:39.880 --> 17:43.601
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to get me to stop, dickhead.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.361
- Brujo: Pablo!
- Oh, good God!

17:57.520 --> 17:59.761
Brujo:
Don't get too close to her!

18:03.640 --> 18:05.449
Pablo, get out of there!

18:11.560 --> 18:13.449
It's that same son of a bitch.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.842
(growling )

18:20.000 --> 18:21.126
We gotta do something!

18:21.280 --> 18:24.443
No, Pablo! Don't, don't, don't.
You saw what it can do.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.971
<i>'</i> Kelly!
<i>'</i> ( roars )

18:29.120 --> 18:30.963
- Oh.
- I got him now.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.201
( Screeches )

18:32.360 --> 18:34.522
- Shit!
- Ah!

18:43.200 --> 18:44.201
Tio, watch out!

18:48.120 --> 18:50.964
" No!
- ( )

18:58.960 --> 19:01.531
( thinking )
Just shoot first and think later...

19:01.680 --> 19:03.045
(echoing )
...or don't think at all.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.607
Yeah, shoot first, think never.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.889
( Echoing )
Shoot first, think never.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.368
(motor humming)

19:39.960 --> 19:42.531
Shoot first, think never.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.920
Noted.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.929
<i>He'! '</i>

19:53.080 --> 19:54.411
Hmm.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.565
Ow.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.202
Oh. Where the fuck am I?

20:03.720 --> 20:06.326
Ah. What happened?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.250
( Lighter clicks )

20:47.240 --> 20:48.765
<i>Good-bye, Ho.</i>

20:50.760 --> 20:54.560
You always tried to tell me
how the world really is.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.290
I should've listened sooner.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.881
( Pablo speaking Spanish )

21:14.160 --> 21:15.525
I'm sorry.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.441
I wish that you
could come with us

21:19.600 --> 21:21.443
and help us fight this thing.

21:27.600 --> 21:33.050
( Brujo's voice
speaking Spanish )

21:41.320 --> 21:43.402
Ah! Fuck! Shit!

21:51.160 --> 21:52.650
I mean, thank you.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.443
I won't let you down, brujo.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.040
Thanks.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.524
So, you okay to travel?

22:36.680 --> 22:38.842
That was some
pretty gnarly stuff back there.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.690
I think I'm good.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.320
I mean, I don't
remember much, though.

22:43.480 --> 22:48.361
I have an image of us arriving
and then nausea and then--

22:48.520 --> 22:50.761
I don't know. My mind
goes totally blank after that.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.729
It's probably a good thing.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.803
<i>WW , what happened'?</i>

22:54.960 --> 22:56.041
What did I do?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.407
It was nothin'.
You spit out a couple of teeth.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.285
I think they were wisdom teeth,
so they were coming out anyway.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.721
I got a spare set of dentures there
if you need them.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.848
I'll survive. Thanks, though.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.570
( Door opens )

23:07.720 --> 23:11.406
You guys, I think that brujo
was trying to give me a sign

23:11.560 --> 23:14.643
from wherever he is.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.768
Or just trying to burn
the hell out of me,

23:16.920 --> 23:19.082
'cause this thing is still really hot.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.451
Hey, buddy... I'm really sorry
about your uncle.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.681
I'm sorry to both of you.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.405
I feel like this is all my fault,

23:29.560 --> 23:31.403
and I have no idea
how to stop it.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.244
That doesn't feel very good.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.528
Ah, come on, Ash, you?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.609
You're not responsible.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.081
Oh, he definitely is, though.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.050
Like-- like 100%.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.806
You know what, probably more.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.406
I liked you better
when you were possessed.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.721
Yeah, me, too.

23:49.880 --> 23:53.487
Um, wow, I must've been
a pretty good time.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.768
Kinda were.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.604
Hey, Ash...

23:57.760 --> 23:59.922
we made
a little something for you.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.368
What?

24:03.520 --> 24:04.601
Well, it's not rosewood,

24:04.760 --> 24:07.161
but, um, maybe it'll help,
you know?

24:07.320 --> 24:09.322
Two hands on the wheel, right?

24:17.120 --> 24:20.647
It's a work in progress,
but check it out.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.723
You can make a fist with it.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.725
Oh. Oh, yeah, baby.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.801
Thanks, guys.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.486
I'm gonna shove this
right up some Deadite's ass.
