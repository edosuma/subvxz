00:01.929 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:05.450
So Wolfram & Hart brought you back.

00:06.129 --> 00:09.080
- What's the plan?
- We want him dark, not dead.

00:09.730 --> 00:13.279
- Stop.
- You stop. God doesn't want you.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.660
But I still do.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

00:44.530 --> 00:45.539
Hello.

00:46.929 --> 00:49.770
Didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

00:50.530 --> 00:51.399
Where is he?

00:51.729 --> 00:55.659
Angel? He's out at the moment.
Is there something I can do?

00:56.530 --> 00:59.969
- I'm his associate.
- Tell me where he is. It's urgent.

01:00.729 --> 01:03.359
We specialize in urgent.
Life and death?

01:03.729 --> 01:06.500
I need someone with his
special abilities.

01:08.530 --> 01:11.760
I understand perfectly.
Why don't you fill me in--

01:12.129 --> 01:15.430
What about you?
You got any special abilities?

01:17.530 --> 01:19.040
A few, I dare say.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.769
- You a creature of the night?
- No.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.680
I was a rogue demon hunter...

01:25.329 --> 01:28.659
...so I can handle myself
when things get rough.

01:30.129 --> 01:31.599
Yeah, you're scary.

01:34.930 --> 01:36.260
He'll be back soon.

01:37.329 --> 01:39.579
If your boss
wants to run a business...

01:39.730 --> 01:42.219
...he shouldn't foist clients off
on his secretary.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.370
That's "associate."

01:55.329 --> 01:56.590
What are you doing?

01:58.329 --> 02:01.519
Knocking things over, driving away
business. The usual.

02:02.530 --> 02:06.040
I found him, and we have to stop him.
We have to change--

02:07.930 --> 02:10.318
You have any clothes a man would wear?

02:37.250 --> 02:39.389
Don't make eye contact. Keep going.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.349
- What are you doing?
- Risking our lives.

02:54.650 --> 02:56.189
- How'd you get in?
- The door.

02:57.050 --> 02:59.330
- They let you in?
- Hello. Lawyer.

02:59.449 --> 03:03.240
- You're not going up there.
- I need to. I have to find her.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.349
- Still Darla.
- You encourage him?

03:06.650 --> 03:08.789
I'm just going along for the ride.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.719
They have vampire detectors.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.800
We know. He's got a plan.

03:15.050 --> 03:17.719
- Plan?
- Get there before I'm stopped.

03:18.650 --> 03:21.669
That's the plan? Walking
real quick was the plan?

03:22.250 --> 03:24.569
Angel, you're insane, and angry...

03:25.250 --> 03:27.389
...and insane. You need help.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.250
I'm not insane or angry.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.990
Man, that's nasty.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.759
Maybe I am a little angry.

03:39.650 --> 03:40.699
Maybe?

04:39.449 --> 04:41.240
Okay, what I wanna know is...

04:43.649 --> 04:46.420
...how did I not know about this
weird stuff?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.180
It's weirder than you think.

04:49.649 --> 04:52.069
The host, the one talking to Angel...

04:52.649 --> 04:55.910
...he helps demons. Reads their souls,
senses their futures.

04:56.250 --> 04:59.300
But he can only do it when
they sing karaoke.

05:00.449 --> 05:04.769
I thought maybe I'd seen you walk away
for the last time. You okay?

05:05.850 --> 05:06.720
Yeah.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.730
Once more, with less feeling.

05:09.449 --> 05:12.430
I guess I'm a little, um...

05:13.050 --> 05:13.750
...rocky.

05:14.250 --> 05:18.250
And Rocky II and half of the one
with Mr.T. Tell me about it.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.420
I just--

05:20.850 --> 05:21.899
I feel this--

05:22.050 --> 05:24.220
Like I have to do something...

05:25.050 --> 05:27.189
...and if I don't, I'll explode.

05:27.449 --> 05:30.290
Then, when I do something,
it feels, uh....

05:32.250 --> 05:34.670
I think maybe this...

05:35.250 --> 05:36.410
...this is it.

05:39.449 --> 05:41.029
I'll sing if I have to.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.850
Wait, are you saying--?
Is he gonna sing?

05:47.250 --> 05:49.000
Oh, God, is Angel gonna sing?

05:49.649 --> 05:52.490
You don't have to.
A break for you, for me...

05:52.649 --> 05:53.910
...and for Mr. Manilow.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.439
Okay. If you're sure.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.329
Poor Angelito. Here.

06:01.649 --> 06:03.930
- What's this?
- A friend in Ojai.

06:04.649 --> 06:08.199
Even though, does he ever call?
Write? Good guy, though.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.459
Ever hear of T'ish Magev?

06:11.250 --> 06:14.230
Ramone. I was just thinking
I'd rather be drinking.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.709
He is a treasure.

06:17.250 --> 06:20.019
T'ish Magev? He's like a swami, right?

06:20.250 --> 06:23.089
Very powerful?
And this is his address.

06:23.850 --> 06:27.079
I'm sending you to him.
You need more than I can do.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.310
Shock your chakras,
filet your soul, whatever you need.

06:31.649 --> 06:32.519
Go to him.

06:34.649 --> 06:36.509
Lovely! That was Cher-iffic boys!

06:41.850 --> 06:45.079
- We're going. I don't have to sing.
- Oh, thank God!

06:45.449 --> 06:48.189
For your sake.
I know you don't like to.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.829
He'll be back soon,

06:57.089 --> 06:58.879
This swami guy sounds magic.

06:59.490 --> 07:03.180
Probably do a spell and zap this
obsession right out of Angel.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.220
Intriguing notion.
Psychiatry through magic.

07:07.290 --> 07:11.569
Instant cures for phobias,
compulsions, identity crises.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.230
Hey, look at me! I'm Angel.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.600
He doesn't spin so much.

07:17.490 --> 07:20.579
Right! This is Angel.

07:21.689 --> 07:25.339
"I can't do anything fun tonight.
I have to count my past sins...

07:25.889 --> 07:30.459
...then alphabetize them. By the way,
I'm thinking of snapping on Friday."

07:33.689 --> 07:35.269
I love Angel and everything...

07:35.490 --> 07:38.370
...but I'm so glad he's headed
the other way.

07:53.490 --> 07:54.189
Yeah?

07:57.089 --> 07:59.860
- I'm looking for the T'ish Magev.
- Found him.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.240
Really? You're the swami?

08:04.889 --> 08:08.009
- You the vampire with the soul?
- Yeah.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.810
In or out? You're letting
in the bugs.

08:23.490 --> 08:25.420
- Where's Angel?
- He's not here.

08:25.889 --> 08:29.120
- You're lying. Give me Angel.
- I can't. Let go!

08:30.089 --> 08:31.980
It's about time you--

08:32.490 --> 08:35.860
My boss needs your boss,
so I can't leave without Angel.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.649
Get him, or I'll blow your head off.

08:39.090 --> 08:41.549
No! No, I.... I can't.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.649
- I don't know where he is, I swear.
- That's too bad.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.980
Wait! Wait! I can--

08:51.090 --> 08:52.000
Please!

08:52.289 --> 08:53.620
I'm Angel.

08:55.289 --> 08:56.899
You looking for me?

09:04.409 --> 09:05.639
Nice ride.

09:06.809 --> 09:09.580
- Sorry?
- The car. Very slick.

09:10.409 --> 09:11.110
Thanks.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.710
What kind of mileage you get?

09:16.409 --> 09:18.509
I don't know, 12 in the city.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.539
Gas hog.

09:20.009 --> 09:22.399
Probably a chick magnet, right?

09:23.009 --> 09:23.710
What?

09:26.009 --> 09:26.779
No.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.509
If you say so.

09:32.610 --> 09:34.779
I'm here to talk about my problems.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.679
That car is your problem.
Says everything.

09:38.610 --> 09:39.450
The car?

09:39.809 --> 09:43.000
- In L.A. it's all about your car.
- I don't think--

09:43.409 --> 09:47.980
A vampire, living in a city known for
its sun, driving a convertible.

09:48.809 --> 09:52.360
- Why do you hate yourself?
- I don't. I got a deal.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.590
A deal? Why not a license plate
that says "Irony"?

09:57.210 --> 09:58.370
Top goes up.

09:59.009 --> 10:01.179
Appearances. Very important to you.

10:01.409 --> 10:03.299
- That's not true.
- Sure it is.

10:03.809 --> 10:06.230
You put your eternal life at risk...

10:06.809 --> 10:09.970
- ...whenever you get in that thing.
- It's just a car.

10:11.009 --> 10:12.549
Why the layers of black?

10:12.809 --> 10:15.230
It's about 80 degrees
in the shade lately.

10:15.809 --> 10:18.019
I don't have a body temperature, so--

10:18.210 --> 10:19.720
So it's for the look.

10:20.610 --> 10:24.090
No. This way, I don't have
to worry about matching.

10:24.809 --> 10:26.809
- I have no reflection--
- You do.

10:29.009 --> 10:29.710
I do?

10:29.610 --> 10:33.259
You're reflected in the people
around you. The way they see you.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.549
What do you think they see?

10:39.809 --> 10:42.720
That-- That-- That won't kill me.

10:44.009 --> 10:45.269
Fine. Let's go.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.860
- Follow me.
- You expect me to follow?

10:50.610 --> 10:53.169
I don't see why I should.

10:53.610 --> 10:55.539
You know the gun won't kill me.

10:56.009 --> 10:57.690
What's it gonna do to her?

10:59.009 --> 11:01.500
- Come on.
- Yes, all right.

11:02.610 --> 11:04.610
But I shan't be cooperative.

11:14.610 --> 11:16.399
I invite you in.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.679
Thank you. Considerate.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.009
You say it was my intention.

11:23.009 --> 11:27.120
Obviously someone gives your
drivers their instructions.

11:27.809 --> 11:30.159
And your drivers?
A little overreaction.

11:31.409 --> 11:33.409
Never know what that will lead to.

11:33.809 --> 11:37.919
It's good we got together. Cleared
it up, no misunderstandings.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.000
I think you understand
perfectly, Paul.

11:44.610 --> 11:45.840
This is Angel.

11:46.409 --> 11:49.179
Angel. Sorry to make you wait.
Business thing.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.240
Come on in.

11:52.409 --> 11:56.480
I'm pleased to meet you, Angel.
My name is Magnus Bryce.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.649
Benny, get him a drink.

12:01.409 --> 12:04.080
I know who you are. I read the papers.

12:04.409 --> 12:06.940
This isn't the way to get
my cooperation.

12:08.009 --> 12:11.840
- Your man abducted me.
- I understand, but I'm desperate.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.559
You help people. I need help.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.559
Protection for someone
very dear to me.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.929
Relax and let me explain.

12:20.610 --> 12:21.590
Cheers.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.460
Blood?

12:24.210 --> 12:27.690
I don't usually drink in front
of humans.

12:28.409 --> 12:30.440
Don't insult me. Go on.

12:30.809 --> 12:32.000
It's fresh.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.100
Dear God!

12:47.610 --> 12:48.769
That's...

12:50.009 --> 12:51.169
...nummy.

12:51.809 --> 12:56.059
The cable network is all a front.
The family money is from wizardry.

12:56.610 --> 13:00.750
My great-grandfather created
our first spell, a tallness illusion.

13:02.009 --> 13:06.049
Now it's all custom-design work
for people with the right money.

13:06.809 --> 13:07.509
Really?

13:07.409 --> 13:09.759
See someone with looks and talent...

13:11.009 --> 13:13.750
...chances are
we provided one of them.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.139
The goddess Yeska doesn't
give with both hands.

13:20.610 --> 13:23.450
Not a nice business.
I have a lot of enemies.

13:24.210 --> 13:25.889
Like the man in the hall?

13:26.009 --> 13:26.779
Paul Lanier?

13:27.809 --> 13:31.639
His firm's in wish-granting.
Euro-creep. And there are others.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.100
- Lanier's threatening you?
- Someone...

13:35.610 --> 13:38.100
...is threatening my daughter.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.980
My only family.

13:40.409 --> 13:42.730
Maybe it's Briggs
at Consolidated Curses.

13:43.409 --> 13:47.309
There are letters, calls.
We've caught intruders in the house.

13:48.210 --> 13:51.789
You're a powerful wizard.
You must know protection spells.

13:52.409 --> 13:55.600
These guys are in the business.
They know the tricks.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.750
- You want me to say I'll protect her.
- No.

14:01.409 --> 14:03.509
You don't get to say anything.

14:04.409 --> 14:06.690
I'm gonna pay you a lot of money.

14:06.809 --> 14:08.909
You'll do it and get paid.

14:09.809 --> 14:11.700
And we'll both be very happy.

14:17.610 --> 14:19.149
There are two "you's,"

14:20.490 --> 14:21.610
Two me's?

14:21.690 --> 14:24.990
The image you've worked to
create, and the real you.

14:28.289 --> 14:32.289
- Maybe my persona is a little affected.
- A little affected? Come on.

14:33.090 --> 14:36.710
Do many warriors slated for
the apocalypse use hair gel?

14:37.289 --> 14:39.460
You're fighting ultimate evil...

14:40.289 --> 14:42.429
...you want something with hold.

14:43.889 --> 14:47.789
But can you triumph over darkness
if you're fighting yourself?

14:48.690 --> 14:50.899
- You think I fight myself?
- Let's see.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.690
Honey, we have a guest.

14:57.690 --> 15:00.529
Oh, look. The vampire's here.

15:01.289 --> 15:02.690
Yes. Hello.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.039
Daddy can send out for about anything.

15:06.690 --> 15:09.710
Virginia, Angel's gone
out of his way to help us.

15:10.289 --> 15:13.200
He has not. You probably
brought him at gunpoint.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.129
What? What's wrong?

15:21.690 --> 15:23.620
- Cover that mirror!
- Why?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.100
Do it!

15:35.490 --> 15:38.190
I'm terribly sorry.
It's just strategy.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.740
If the attack were to happen here--

15:42.090 --> 15:45.779
If I were to fight here,
I wouldn't want my opponents...

15:46.289 --> 15:48.570
...to know too soon what I really am.

15:49.889 --> 15:50.659
Good man.

15:51.090 --> 15:54.210
Great. He's gonna let
kidnappers into my room.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.889
May I speak to Virginia alone?

15:58.889 --> 16:00.679
I'll be right outside.

16:05.490 --> 16:08.370
You were right. I didn't want
to be here.

16:09.690 --> 16:13.100
- He thinks he owns everyone.
- But there are threats.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.889
You need to be protected.

16:20.490 --> 16:22.909
Lots of books. Must spend time in here.

16:23.490 --> 16:27.669
There have been many threats.
Each new one, I buy a bookshelf.

16:28.889 --> 16:31.870
Virginia, we're both stuck here.
So it seems to me...

16:32.490 --> 16:36.529
...I may as well do what he wants me
to do and protect you.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.649
Think you're the vampire for the job?

16:42.090 --> 16:43.629
Well, I want to try.

16:45.090 --> 16:46.320
You gonna fight me?

16:51.690 --> 16:53.269
Let's go shopping.

16:54.090 --> 16:55.350
What?

16:55.889 --> 16:58.240
Wouldn't you rather wait
till morning...

16:58.889 --> 17:00.539
...when I can't leave the house?

17:01.289 --> 17:04.480
Yes, as your bodyguard,
I insist we go at once.

17:07.289 --> 17:08.799
We're going shopping.

17:09.410 --> 17:12.009
- At gunpoint?
- Yes. The point of a gun.

17:13.009 --> 17:15.430
He walked Wesley right out of here.

17:16.009 --> 17:19.240
And this "I'm Angel" thing is
a very bad idea.

17:19.608 --> 17:23.299
If I thought it would work,
I could have been Angel.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.839
- It's a girlie name.
- Where'd they go?

17:26.809 --> 17:29.900
- I tried to follow but lost them.
- What's the plan?

17:30.410 --> 17:34.059
You go get Angel from the swami place,
I track down Wesley.

17:34.609 --> 17:38.650
The guy was pretty distinctive.
Maybe he has a criminal record.

17:39.410 --> 17:40.279
Mug shots!

17:40.609 --> 17:43.210
It'll take me a while
to find this place.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.599
Gunn, this thug guy is bad news.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.309
I hate to think where Wesley is.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.670
I say, this place is extraordinary.

17:59.809 --> 18:01.839
Wizard supplies.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.839
It's a little exposed though,
isn't it?

18:08.210 --> 18:10.099
Are you really safe here?

18:11.809 --> 18:13.109
You tell me.

18:14.809 --> 18:15.859
Oh, yes.

18:16.009 --> 18:17.730
My job, exactly.

18:19.009 --> 18:20.730
To make it safe.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.549
I shall certainly do my best.

18:24.410 --> 18:28.269
We all do our best for Daddy.
Makes shopping for him a real pain.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.630
We're looking for a gift?

18:32.210 --> 18:36.250
His birthday. Number 50.
That's why he's so twitchy lately.

18:37.009 --> 18:39.329
Big party makes security dodgy.

18:40.009 --> 18:42.470
Plus, there's a mid-life
thing going on.

18:44.809 --> 18:46.180
Talismans?

18:46.609 --> 18:50.230
Images of the goddess Yeska,
his favorite creepy deity.

18:51.410 --> 18:54.710
- What do you think of the gold one?
- Attractive.

18:55.609 --> 18:58.799
It isn't real gold.
One good spell would melt it.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.019
- Go with iron.
- You sound like Dad.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.329
He really gets into all this stuff.

19:06.410 --> 19:08.619
Loves it all. The rituals, magic....

19:09.410 --> 19:11.130
You don't love it?

19:11.809 --> 19:13.700
I used to, when I was little.

19:14.809 --> 19:16.700
It's been just us for a long time.

19:17.210 --> 19:19.490
He used to sit me next to him...

19:20.210 --> 19:24.319
...and teach me about runic
incantations or enchanted armor.

19:25.609 --> 19:28.380
- Not anymore?
- No. I mean--

19:29.210 --> 19:30.960
He still loves the stuff.

19:32.809 --> 19:34.529
Guy's gotta love something.

19:35.210 --> 19:39.039
He obviously loves you. He's gone
to some trouble to protect you.

19:40.009 --> 19:42.109
He has his car insured too.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.539
Doesn't that hurt?

19:46.609 --> 19:48.400
Oh! Hot! Hot.

19:51.410 --> 19:52.490
Cold! Cold.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.240
Virginia, say goodbye to
the pretty guy.

19:55.609 --> 19:56.690
- Wait--
- Angel!

19:58.009 --> 19:59.690
You're Angel? The vampire?

19:59.809 --> 20:01.910
Yes, I am.

20:02.809 --> 20:05.410
I'm Angel. The vampire with a soul.

20:06.410 --> 20:09.529
Fighting for my redemption with...

20:10.009 --> 20:11.660
...killing evil demons.

20:13.009 --> 20:15.779
That's right, scourge
of the demon world.

20:16.609 --> 20:18.640
Don't worry, I don't kill humans.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.690
Unless I'm angry.

20:22.009 --> 20:24.430
- We were just doing what he said.
- Lanier?

20:26.210 --> 20:27.329
Fine.

20:27.410 --> 20:30.319
You're gonna leave now.
Then tell Lanier--

20:34.609 --> 20:36.329
Forget about the girl.

20:37.009 --> 20:37.779
Now, go.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.599
We better get you home. It's not safe.

20:48.410 --> 20:52.269
I think if we give them a next time,
it could get a lot rougher.

20:55.369 --> 20:57.650
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

21:01.970 --> 21:02.980
You're wimping.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.589
- This isn't a dance. Fight!
- I am.

21:06.170 --> 21:08.059
Fighting yourself. Fight me!

21:09.170 --> 21:10.680
Why can't you let go?

21:12.769 --> 21:13.819
- Because.
- Why?

21:14.569 --> 21:16.740
If I let it, it'll  kill you.

21:16.970 --> 21:17.880
It?

21:20.569 --> 21:21.619
The demon.

21:22.369 --> 21:24.259
- But the demon is you.
- No.

21:24.769 --> 21:28.099
Yes. That's the thing you've
tried so hard to conceal.

21:28.970 --> 21:30.900
I can't let it control me.

21:33.170 --> 21:33.900
I see.

21:37.369 --> 21:39.400
You don't think it controls you?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.589
I can't do this much longer,

21:45.170 --> 21:47.769
There's something we didn't
think about.

21:48.769 --> 21:51.680
- He can smell blood,
- What are you talking about?

21:51.769 --> 21:54.329
It's only a matter of time before...

21:55.369 --> 21:57.259
...he finds the real Magev's body.

21:57.769 --> 22:00.019
I know you want me to keep him here--

22:00.170 --> 22:01.500
Stop. Angel's there?

22:01.970 --> 22:04.670
Yeah. He's right outside. Brooding.

22:05.569 --> 22:08.869
Came after he spoke to the host,
like Ramone said. Why?

22:09.170 --> 22:11.029
The vampire's with you?

22:13.369 --> 22:16.279
Then who the hell is the English guy?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.750
Celeb photos.

22:44.210 --> 22:46.240
Celeb photos. Page 46.

22:55.009 --> 22:56.269
It's him!

22:59.210 --> 23:00.750
I hope you weren't frightened.

23:01.609 --> 23:03.220
No. More angry, you know.

23:03.410 --> 23:05.940
- They tried to intimidate you.
- Not at them, at everything.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.339
The fact that I have to
live like this.

23:08.809 --> 23:12.039
- It's a bad situation.
- It's a bad situation?

23:13.609 --> 23:15.220
It's a waste of a life.

23:15.410 --> 23:18.640
I keep waiting for my life
to start, and it never does.

23:19.609 --> 23:23.960
There's just more locks and
surveillance cameras and....

23:25.009 --> 23:27.470
Guards? What is this now?
Bedroom guards?

23:28.009 --> 23:30.640
- You go back and tell my dad--
- Stop it!

23:32.809 --> 23:35.160
Let your flesh be weakened.

23:45.410 --> 23:46.529
You were amazing.

23:49.009 --> 23:50.170
I was a bit.

23:51.410 --> 23:54.009
Your face. You don't go all...

23:55.609 --> 23:57.400
...like a regular vampire.

23:58.609 --> 24:02.930
I suppose I'm not like
a regular vampire.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.490
Not a vampire at all really.

24:07.609 --> 24:09.680
They brought her back as a human.

24:10.609 --> 24:13.490
This Darla girl, why'd they do that?

24:14.210 --> 24:17.690
I don't know. But seeing
her again, it's just....

24:18.410 --> 24:20.160
It's triggered the inner struggle.

24:20.809 --> 24:23.789
- Yeah.
- She's not the one who did this to you.

24:24.410 --> 24:27.710
No, it's still Darla.
It's kind of hard to explain.

24:28.609 --> 24:30.500
What hard? You're obsessed.

24:32.210 --> 24:35.019
- I guess I am a little, yeah.
- You blame her.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.420
- I suppose.
- You want to punish her.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.859
- A bit.
- And you want to thank her.

24:41.210 --> 24:42.930
- Thank her?
- For the gift she gave you.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.640
- Gift?
- You're deeply ambivalent.

24:46.009 --> 24:49.309
- I am and I'm not.
- You need to get over her.

24:50.809 --> 24:52.910
Okay, what does she look like?

24:54.410 --> 24:57.180
She's beautiful. Small, blond.

24:58.009 --> 24:59.690
Right. So here's what you do.

24:59.809 --> 25:02.509
You go out and find yourself
a small, blond thing.

25:03.410 --> 25:06.960
You bed her, love her, you treat
her like crap. You break her heart.

25:07.609 --> 25:10.279
You and your inner demon
will thank me, I promise.

25:15.089 --> 25:19.130
Are you all right? I mean,
two close calls like that?

25:21.690 --> 25:25.019
I guess so. I don't know.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.259
Are we safe now?

25:28.289 --> 25:29.480
I don't know.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.859
Sometimes I think about running away.

25:37.289 --> 25:39.779
Isn't that ridiculous?
A 24-year-old runaway?

25:40.890 --> 25:43.559
We all want to escape
our lives sometimes.

25:45.690 --> 25:50.259
I think about getting my own place.
A little apartment.

25:51.089 --> 25:54.109
A job. Something silly, like...

25:55.289 --> 25:59.079
...a perfume sprayer or
working in a tire store.

26:01.289 --> 26:02.549
A tire store?

26:03.089 --> 26:05.859
- I told you it was ridiculous.
- No, it sounds wonderful.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.529
Rotating tires, inflating things.

26:10.890 --> 26:12.849
Your father wouldn't allow it.

26:13.289 --> 26:15.920
No, it's too dangerous.

26:17.490 --> 26:21.740
He says they would grab me in a
second and use me to get to him.

26:24.089 --> 26:27.250
If you think about it,
he's saying that if I moved out...

26:28.289 --> 26:30.849
...it would kill him.
I'd be responsible.

26:32.490 --> 26:34.450
That's a huge burden to put on you.

26:35.490 --> 26:36.789
I just...

26:37.890 --> 26:39.750
...I just want out.

26:52.890 --> 26:53.970
Virginia....

27:00.089 --> 27:03.740
I'm sorry. I know we can't.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.059
Yes. Why?

27:07.289 --> 27:11.079
You're a pretty famous guy, Angel.
I hear the guards talk sometimes.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.700
- I know.
- Know?

27:13.890 --> 27:15.329
About the curse.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.289
The curse.

27:23.490 --> 27:25.420
- Curse?
- Yeah, I thought you knew.

27:25.890 --> 27:27.359
They don't tell me everything.

27:28.289 --> 27:32.640
- So you really can't...at all?
- That's what makes me special, right?

27:33.690 --> 27:36.250
Right. No, that's real special.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.259
So it's a sex thing?

27:39.690 --> 27:42.150
- I mean, not specifically.
- Then what specifically?

27:42.690 --> 27:46.829
Perfect happiness.
Yes, of course.

27:48.089 --> 27:49.140
Mustn't....

27:51.690 --> 27:52.880
Mustn't....

27:55.890 --> 27:58.349
Mustn't let oneself...

28:00.690 --> 28:02.650
...let myself get...

28:04.890 --> 28:07.589
...diabolical.
Consequences....

28:08.490 --> 28:09.539
I should....

28:10.890 --> 28:14.720
You know, this whole curse thing
has been widely misinterpreted.

28:15.089 --> 28:16.140
Really?

28:16.890 --> 28:18.220
Oh, yes.

28:18.690 --> 28:22.869
Less of a curse.
More of a hex, actually.

28:24.089 --> 28:25.980
Barely that.

28:27.089 --> 28:28.809
A recommendation.

28:33.089 --> 28:35.900
Are you sure you're telling the truth?

28:37.289 --> 28:40.339
I wanna be honest with you.
I want to tell you everything.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.980
I'm not actually....

29:02.569 --> 29:05.200
Yo, yo! Anybody home?

29:06.170 --> 29:07.569
Morning, traveler.

29:07.970 --> 29:10.359
- Do you seek enlightenment?
- I seek Angel. He with you?

29:10.970 --> 29:13.809
He was until the sun came up. Then....

29:14.569 --> 29:16.289
See that pile of dust over there?

29:18.170 --> 29:20.309
I'm just joking.
He's inside. Come on.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.799
Joking? We got ourselves
a funny Zen master.

29:28.369 --> 29:30.400
Which lesson was that, exactly?

29:31.369 --> 29:33.509
He was not your friend.
I sensed danger.

29:34.369 --> 29:36.509
Where's the real T'ish Magev?
Did you kill him?

29:36.769 --> 29:38.349
Did you put him in the lake?

29:39.769 --> 29:42.470
Something like that.
But you know what?

29:42.769 --> 29:46.740
I'm not worried about you now,
seeing as you can't get any closer.

29:48.769 --> 29:52.420
Wonderful sunshine.
Wish you were here.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.660
- What are you doing?
- Getting in touch with my inner demon.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.170
There you are! I found you!

30:38.569 --> 30:40.430
How did you get in here?

30:40.970 --> 30:43.460
I told them I worked for Angel,
and they sent me in.

30:44.569 --> 30:46.150
You've got everybody scared here.

30:46.369 --> 30:48.440
They don't even know you're a Shemp.

30:49.369 --> 30:52.000
- Hey, you're Virginia Bryce.
- Who are you?

30:52.369 --> 30:54.970
This is Cordelia Chase.
She works for me.

30:57.170 --> 30:59.559
Virginia, I left my coat....

31:00.170 --> 31:01.150
I'll get it.

31:02.569 --> 31:05.029
Good move. Let's scuttle
our butts out of here!

31:06.170 --> 31:07.849
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

31:07.970 --> 31:10.289
I'm rescuing you.
Key ingredient: We leave.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.410
I understand. But I have to stay.
I have a job to do.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.980
What is wrong with you?
You've got delusions of Angel.

31:18.170 --> 31:21.430
You're not him. You can't
do stuff on your own.

31:22.369 --> 31:23.420
Oh, crud.

31:24.769 --> 31:28.279
Mr. Bryce, I've seen your picture.
And you're from the armed abduction.

31:29.569 --> 31:33.750
I had Miss Chase testing your
defensive perimeter, and I must say...

31:34.369 --> 31:36.470
...did you know your
guards just let her in?

31:36.769 --> 31:40.700
I told them to. I wanted my daughter
to hear them call you your real name.

31:41.569 --> 31:43.710
- Wait.
- What's going on? What real name?

31:43.970 --> 31:46.599
I got a call from an anonymous
friend with some information.

31:47.569 --> 31:50.240
- This guy isn't Angel.
- I am so Angel!

31:51.170 --> 31:53.630
No, not the sun, for I'm a vampire!

31:54.769 --> 31:56.559
Oh, no, it burns!

32:04.369 --> 32:05.880
You're not Angel.

32:15.769 --> 32:18.230
My name is Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

32:22.970 --> 32:26.480
I talked to you. I trusted you.

32:27.769 --> 32:29.170
You lied to me.

32:31.369 --> 32:34.039
Come to think of it, you
actually put my life in danger.

32:34.970 --> 32:37.710
I was walking around thinking
I had vampire protection.

32:39.170 --> 32:42.960
Here's the funny part.
I finally thought I had a friend.

32:58.369 --> 33:01.700
- You kind of screwed her over.
- Get out of my house.

33:02.569 --> 33:04.009
Take the piece with you.

33:04.369 --> 33:06.720
The piece?
Is that supposed to be me?

33:07.970 --> 33:10.640
Should've let me kill him.
You gonna let him go?

33:10.970 --> 33:13.569
Never tell me what to do!
You brought me the wrong guy.

33:13.970 --> 33:16.250
You risked the whole sacrifice.
Understand?

33:17.569 --> 33:21.119
But I'm not gonna kill you,
because I need you now, Benny.

33:21.769 --> 33:24.259
It's only a few hours
till the sacrifice.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.440
You understand the need
for security in this?

33:27.769 --> 33:29.700
This is the party of my life.

33:36.170 --> 33:38.130
Obviously, Virginia's too.

33:44.970 --> 33:47.880
Well, that was pretty humiliating.

33:50.369 --> 33:52.509
Angel, Gunn. What happened?

33:53.369 --> 33:54.630
He got hit.

33:54.569 --> 33:58.329
By who? The swami?
Swamis don't hit. Swamis swamm.

33:59.369 --> 34:02.000
- Why is Wesley wearing my coat?
- There was a lot of swami.

34:02.369 --> 34:04.400
- The T'ish Magev hit him?
- He was a fake.

34:05.369 --> 34:08.000
Someone hired him to get
me out of the way.

34:08.369 --> 34:10.260
He took out the real Magev.

34:10.768 --> 34:13.400
- Did you find out who hired him?
- He wouldn't say.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.579
That is my coat, right?

34:16.768 --> 34:20.420
It has to be Paul Lanier. He thought
that would keep Virginia unprotected.

34:21.570 --> 34:24.518
When his men couldn't take me out,
he told Bryce I wasn't Angel.

34:25.170 --> 34:28.610
- He hoped Bryce would get rid of me.
- What's going on?

34:29.369 --> 34:31.539
- Were you in Virginia?
- That's not the point.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.190
He posed as you, protecting
a girl named Virginia.

34:35.369 --> 34:37.860
Lanier is trying to kill her
or abduct her or something.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.510
She's probably in danger
at the party.

34:40.768 --> 34:42.139
- Party?
- Her father's.

34:42.570 --> 34:45.199
Big wizard event. Cake,
tributes to the goddess Yeska.

34:46.170 --> 34:49.289
Yeska? Wait a minute. I know
Yeska. She's no goddess.

34:49.768 --> 34:51.980
- What do you mean?
- She's a Davric demon.

34:52.768 --> 34:55.860
They don't serve humans,
unless the humans make a sacrifice.

34:56.369 --> 35:00.159
- Sacrifice?
- Davrics eat live sacrifices, girls.

35:01.170 --> 35:05.349
They grant huge power to the person
who offers a sacrifice on--

35:06.570 --> 35:11.099
On their 50th birthday. Bryce is
gonna sacrifice his own daughter.

35:11.969 --> 35:13.969
Why is Lanier trying to abduct her?

35:14.369 --> 35:16.860
Bryce will get a lot of
power off this sacrifice.

35:17.369 --> 35:21.369
Angel, Gunn, go to the front of the
house. Cordelia, we'll go to the back.

35:22.769 --> 35:25.960
I'm sorry. You know this sort of
thing best. How should we proceed?

35:28.170 --> 35:31.260
Well, Gunn and I could...

35:32.369 --> 35:33.599
...take the back.

35:34.170 --> 35:37.610
- Very good. Let's go.
- Wesley, can I get my coat back?

35:49.929 --> 35:51.719
What is this horrible thing?

35:52.329 --> 35:54.650
I hope a girl isn't gonna
jump out of it or something.

35:55.329 --> 35:56.519
Not really.

35:58.329 --> 35:59.380
Thank you.

36:02.530 --> 36:07.099
I wanna thank all of you for being
here on this special occasion.

36:08.530 --> 36:10.070
My feelings....

36:12.730 --> 36:17.050
My feelings run almost too deep for
words, but I'll try to do this...

36:18.130 --> 36:19.289
...and do it right.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.510
What is he talking about?

36:24.730 --> 36:29.440
Yeska, of the razor eyes and
stone heart, take this offering.

36:30.730 --> 36:35.300
I cast my most precious emerald into
the ocean on my 50th birthday.

36:36.130 --> 36:37.599
Daddy, what are you doing?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.280
Daddy? Hey! What are you--?

36:40.929 --> 36:43.210
- Take my gift.
- Daddy, stop them!

36:45.730 --> 36:47.170
- Stop now!
- Let her death...

36:47.530 --> 36:50.510
...return tenfold unto me my power.

36:51.130 --> 36:52.289
Make them stop!

36:52.929 --> 36:56.510
Be a good girl now.
This is hard enough already.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.199
He's really torn about it.

36:59.530 --> 37:02.159
Help! Somebody help me!

37:03.730 --> 37:04.809
Daddy?

37:21.130 --> 37:23.199
- Release her or die.
- Don't I say that?

37:24.130 --> 37:25.179
Guards!

37:51.130 --> 37:52.320
I'll get you out of here.

37:52.329 --> 37:55.380
The hour approaches, Yeska.
Do not be blind to my plea.

37:57.730 --> 37:59.170
Yeska, I beseech thee!

38:01.329 --> 38:02.769
Appear!

38:10.329 --> 38:13.099
The sacrifice...

38:14.530 --> 38:17.340
...is impure!

38:22.929 --> 38:25.179
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.090
- Why did you come back?
- I said I'd protect you.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.039
She's impure?

38:37.929 --> 38:39.719
She's not a virgin?

38:42.130 --> 38:43.210
You....

38:44.530 --> 38:46.110
- Impure?
- She slept with him?

38:46.329 --> 38:48.820
This wouldn't have happened
if you were Angel.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.960
That's why I hired him. He's a eunuch.

38:52.929 --> 38:54.190
- You slept with her?
- A eunuch?

38:54.730 --> 38:58.030
- Things happen. Two people, danger.
- What are you talking about?

38:58.329 --> 39:00.219
She was a virgin before you got here.

39:00.730 --> 39:02.869
- I was not a virgin!
- What?

39:03.730 --> 39:05.940
- Thank God.
- I could've told you that.

39:06.730 --> 39:08.519
- Not a eunuch.
- One day as Angel.

39:09.130 --> 39:11.619
- One day, and he's getting some.
- What?

39:12.130 --> 39:14.230
How could you?
I kept you away from all men.

39:14.530 --> 39:15.929
The curse isn't even that clear.

39:16.329 --> 39:20.829
Daddy, you remember that chauffeur
from when I was 16? And the one at 18?

39:22.329 --> 39:25.489
I haven't been a virgin
for a very long time.

39:27.130 --> 39:28.920
I even dated Rick.

39:33.730 --> 39:36.010
Ginny, don't do this.
Don't make me angry.

39:36.730 --> 39:40.489
Right. Because then you
might do something bad.

39:40.929 --> 39:43.349
You were going to kill me!

39:45.730 --> 39:48.289
You are not my father anymore.

39:55.929 --> 39:57.230
I'm not a eunuch.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.559
Look.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.579
"Virginia Bryce, squired by
Mr. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce...

40:10.369 --> 40:13.280
...private detective and
bodyguard to the stars."

40:13.969 --> 40:17.340
- "Squired"? Who says squired?
- Look at him all over her.

40:18.769 --> 40:20.519
You're jealous he's getting attention.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.309
Damn skippy! He's getting
famous off this!

40:23.570 --> 40:25.320
Reflected glory, that's my thing!

40:25.969 --> 40:27.690
Get a little perspective.

40:31.369 --> 40:34.699
"Bodyguard to the stars."
Yeah, right.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.699
There's no Wyndam-Pryce Agency,

41:14.570 --> 41:16.500
Thank you, thank you very much,
