WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:07.465
Yeah, yeah. All right.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.570
-Chinese food.
-There's my Chinese food.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.441
I gotta run.

00:14.614 --> 00:15.603
All you.

00:15.782 --> 00:17.909
-Who was it?
-I did a show for a car dealership.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.609
-They're getting me a new Saab.
-What about your old car?

00:20.787 --> 00:23.620
-Couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
-No. The engine clotted.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.224
You know who set
this whole thing up? Frank Merman.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.860
Fragile Frankie Merman?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.957
-Never liked that guy.
-Why? He's harmless.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.361
Every summer, you guys
went to camp together.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.024
I was jealous.
It felt he was the summer me.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.863
-He was not the summer you.
-Yeah.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.938
Besides, you had a summer me.

00:40.106 --> 00:43.405
Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you
into <i>Last Tango in Paris.</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:46.702
I made him up.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.144
So you never saw
<i>Last Tango in Paris?</i>

00:49.315 --> 00:51.545
-No.
-Too bad, it was erotic.

00:54.754 --> 00:59.714
Well, I've had it
with these jack-booted thugs.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.091
Pottery Barn?

01:02.262 --> 01:04.560
I got three Pottery Barn catalogs
in one day.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.131
That makes eight this month.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.563
Mira Sorvino.
Think she'd go out with me?

01:12.672 --> 01:14.401
Why don't you just throw them out?

01:14.574 --> 01:16.974
No. I've been saving them up
here in your apartment.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.168
And now, it's payback time.

01:19.345 --> 01:22.246
Pottery Barn is in for a world of hurt.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.681
Can I have one?

01:25.151 --> 01:27.483
I need one of those
old-looking phones.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.181
So you wanna grab a bite?

01:30.356 --> 01:32.620
I can't. I gotta make
the weekly call to the folks.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.657
-So call now.
-Gotta prep.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.490
I need a couple of anecdotes,
a few you-were-right-abouts.

01:37.664 --> 01:38.756
It's a whole procedure.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.963
Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one
that used to run to the woods...

01:42.135 --> 01:43.932
-...every time he got upset?
-That's him.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.995
-He still nuts?
-What do you think?

01:46.172 --> 01:47.969
They gave me a new car
for 30 minutes of:

01:48.141 --> 01:50.041
"So who's from out of town?"

01:54.581 --> 01:57.379
Seriously, is this the best okra
you've ever had or what?

01:58.485 --> 02:00.817
-Delish.
-Delish?

02:01.287 --> 02:04.051
Delish. You know,
short for delicious.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.657
Oh, like scrump.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.321
Yeah.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.860
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you later.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.826
Excuse me.
Can I borrow your ketchup?

02:16.002 --> 02:17.196
Oh, sure.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.339
Thanks.

02:28.581 --> 02:30.572
-Hello?
-Hey, it's Georgie.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.480
-Let me put your father on the phone.
-<i>Ma.</i>

02:34.220 --> 02:35.710
Who's this?

02:36.289 --> 02:38.052
Dad, it's me.

02:38.224 --> 02:41.387
Listen, I was at Fortunoff's
the other day and you know what...

02:41.561 --> 02:43.153
...you were right.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.431
Chinese food.

02:46.232 --> 02:49.395
Sorry, George, our Chinese food
just came. Talk to you later.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.560
Chinese food?

02:57.143 --> 03:01.944
Hey, you like sending out catalogs?
How do you like getting them back?

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.760 --> 03:15.591
So maybe they had Chinese food.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.820
After dark?

03:16.996 --> 03:20.227
Please. At their age
that's like swallowing stun grenades.

03:21.401 --> 03:24.165
Well, there's one way to check.
Where there's Chinese food...

03:24.337 --> 03:25.964
...there's leftovers.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.566
Well, gentlemen...

03:31.544 --> 03:34.980
...Laney is in love.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.639
Dynamite. I'll look
for the Chinese food leftovers.

03:37.817 --> 03:42.277
Hey, hey, hey. I met this guy.
And it was like this...

03:42.822 --> 03:46.155
...totally unreal fairy tale moment.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.953
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.121
Oh, George's friend?
Whatever happened to him?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.628
Nothing. I don't know. I gotta go.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.095
So this is beautiful.

03:57.270 --> 04:01.400
You and Puddy and this new guy
in a big pot of love stew.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.100
Yeah. Puddy.

04:05.778 --> 04:10.272
Well, I won't fire him
until I see if this new guy...

04:10.450 --> 04:13.010
...can handle the workload.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.385
Will you look at this?
More catalogs.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.526
Omaha Steaks, MacWarehouse.
<i>Newsweek?</i>

04:21.226 --> 04:22.785
I can't stop all these companies...

04:22.962 --> 04:25.829
...so I'm gonna attack this problem
at the choke point.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.125
Stop the mail?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.128
That's even better.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.804
-Jerry.
-Hey, Frankie.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.033
So where's the car?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.269
This is it.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.508
-Inside the van?
-It is the van.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.375
Don't you remember, we always
talked about how cool it would be...

04:46.552 --> 04:48.383
...to have a van and just drive.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.218
We were 10.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.717
Come on. Let's take it for a spin.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.318
I don't want a van.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.156
Just tell him you want the Saab.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.696
You don't understand.
This is Fragile Frankie Merman.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.697
When we were in camp,
if you upset him...

05:01.868 --> 05:04.359
...he'd run into the woods,
dig a hole, and sit in it.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.637
Well, I have an idea.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.969
Keep the van and just get
a bumper sticker that says:

05:10.143 --> 05:14.136
"lf this van's a-rocking,
don't come a-knocking."

05:14.314 --> 05:16.009
Always helpful.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.714
Oh, Georgie.
What are you doing here?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.720
Just dropped in for a visit. You....

05:23.890 --> 05:25.323
You never called me back.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.550
Oh, the phone broke.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.222
Well, we gotta get moving.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.423
-What? Where are you going?
-We have a catered affair.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.694
-You're going like that?
-It's creative black tie.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.264
Move, woman.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.438
No Chinese leftovers.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.105
George is getting suspicious.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.917
Elaine, I'm sorry I'm late.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.054
I'm gonna be in the can.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.054
Okay, Jack.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.398
-Can I use your phone?
-Sure.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.334
Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.134
Yeah. That's right. Again.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.637
Thanks.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.506
-Nice captain's chairs, huh?
-Aye, aye.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.977
Oh, there's a spot. Just back up.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.790
Hold on. There must be a truck
backing up.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.620
-No, that's us.
-Great.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.558
You know, Frankie, I was wondering.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.667
What if I decided that it's silly
to have a van because, you know...

06:42.835 --> 06:44.769
...I live in New York City.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.940
Is there maybe some way
I could exchange it?

06:49.542 --> 06:52.602
-You don't like the van?
-No, no, no. It's just hypothetically.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.180
-I gotta go to the park.
-No. No, you don't.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.610
No woods.

06:56.783 --> 07:00.583
I love the van. I'm a van guy.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.411
Check it out.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.648
Rain and sleet may not stop them.

07:05.825 --> 07:09.090
But let's see them
get by these bricks.

07:09.662 --> 07:10.993
Where'd you get the bricks?

07:11.164 --> 07:14.099
Jerry, the whole building is brick.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.968
You wanna take a ride
with me out to Jersey?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.001
I'm gonna try and sell
the van to a lot.

07:19.472 --> 07:23.636
A dealer? Are you insane?
No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.

07:24.010 --> 07:28.174
I don't think I wanna meet the people
that are in the market for a used van.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.010
-Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
-Okay.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.913
All right. Okay.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.712
Here we go. Yeah.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.151
So for sale, huh?

07:37.323 --> 07:38.722
For sale.

07:38.891 --> 07:42.793
A big juicy van.

07:44.797 --> 07:50.394
And oh, we gotta put down,
"interesting trades considered."

07:50.803 --> 07:53.169
-I don't wanna trade.
-No, no, no. You don't have to.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.330
It's all about tickling
their buying bone.

07:57.176 --> 08:00.873
You know what? This is all your mail.
They're putting it in my box now.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.605
Let me see that.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.548
Oh, that's it. They have gone too far.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.210
They keep pushing me
and pushing me.

08:09.388 --> 08:13.654
Now I got no choice
but to go down there and talk to them.

08:15.695 --> 08:16.889
Hey, Jerry.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.894
I'd like you to meet someone.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.862
This is Jack.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.667
-May I help you?
-Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.902
Certainly. How long would
you like us to hold it?

08:33.078 --> 08:36.845
Oh, no, no, no. I don't think
you get me. I want out. Permanently.

08:37.316 --> 08:38.613
I'll handle this, Violet.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.412
Why don't you take
your three-hour break?

08:41.621 --> 08:45.455
All right, calm down, everyone.
No one's canceling any mail.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.185
-Oh, yes, I am.
-Well, what about your bills?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.386
-The bank can pay them.
-The bank.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.292
Then what about your cards
and letters?

08:52.465 --> 08:57.198
E-mail, telephones, fax machines,
FedEx, Telex, telegrams.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.429
-Holograms.
-All right. It's true.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.630
Of course nobody needs mail.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.401
What, you think you're so clever,
figuring that one out?

09:04.577 --> 09:07.307
But you don't know the half
of what goes on here.

09:07.480 --> 09:12.247
So just walk away, Kramer.
I beg of you.

09:12.752 --> 09:16.483
Is everything all right here,
postal employee Newman?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.648
Yes, sir. I believe
everything is all squared away.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.656
Isn't it, Mr. Kramer?

09:21.827 --> 09:24.796
Oh, yeah.
As long as I stop getting mail.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.867
Welcome back.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.273
Pretty quick, for a catered affair.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.767
I don't know what you mean.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.708
You ditched me. That's twice.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.780
Now I demand to know
what's going on.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.612
George, we've had it with you.

09:47.787 --> 09:52.315
Understand, we love you like a son,
but even parents have limits.

09:52.491 --> 09:57.428
The breakups, the firings,
and every Sunday with the calls.

09:58.297 --> 10:02.131
What my wife is trying to say is,
this is supposed to be our time.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.030
-I'm not following.
-I'm sorry, George.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.536
-We're cutting you loose.
-You're cutting me loose?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.334
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna make love to your mother.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.851
They don't want to see me anymore.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.180
But this is what
you've always wanted.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.323
It is.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.188
Just not ready yet.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.089
-That's kind of sweet.
-Shut up, Jerry.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.991
My parents think
they can ignore me.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.567
Well, they better think again.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.568
Oh, no, George. Please.
What are you gonna do?

10:38.738 --> 10:41.206
You remember my cousin, Rhisa?

10:41.540 --> 10:44.031
-I'm gonna date her.
-Mother of God.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.374
One little wink. She'll freak out,
tell my parents. They'll be all over me.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.708
What is this tape?

10:50.883 --> 10:53.374
That guy Elaine's dating
seems really familiar to me.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.885
I think he might be a comedian
I worked with one time.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.589
Wait a second. What--?
What, what is this?

10:59.759 --> 11:01.659
<i>This weekend
Nobody Beats The Wiz...</i>

11:01.827 --> 11:04.489
<i>...is slashing prices
on our entire stock.</i>

11:04.664 --> 11:07.565
<i>Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.</i>

11:07.733 --> 11:10.861
<i>Yes. I'm the Wiz. I'm the Wiz.</i>

11:13.739 --> 11:15.070
That is the guy.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.936
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?

11:17.109 --> 11:18.736
She thinks she's in love with him.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.879
She's just remembering
this old commercial.

11:21.047 --> 11:25.074
-That's pretty pathetic.
-I know. They're not even related.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.145
Hey.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.980
Hey.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.680
-I'm gonna get going.
-Have fun at the family reunion.

11:34.927 --> 11:38.419
So, what do you know
about this Jack fella?

11:38.597 --> 11:41.964
-Isn't he the best?
-Yeah, nobody beats him.

11:42.134 --> 11:43.465
Yeah.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.636
What kind of work does he do?

11:45.805 --> 11:49.138
Oh, right now he's a fact-checker
for <i>New York Magazine</i>.

11:49.709 --> 11:54.146
It's not much, but it has a certain kind
of quiet dignity.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.211
Right. Quiet dignity.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.614
As opposed to, say...

12:00.786 --> 12:01.878
...this.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.148
<i>Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.</i>

12:05.324 --> 12:08.452
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.055
Hello?

12:12.231 --> 12:15.496
Yeah, the van is still for sale.
Sure, come on by.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.396
Yeah, I called about the van.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.307
-Some more merlot?
-Yeah, thanks.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.909
Sure.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.004
You know, Rhisa, l--

12:31.717 --> 12:34.083
I've always found you
very attractive.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.645
What?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.456
I know it may sound shocking...

12:40.626 --> 12:45.495
...but I just can't stop myself
from wanting you.

12:45.664 --> 12:47.689
You wanna borrow money, right?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.834
No, no. I-- I just want us to be...

12:52.071 --> 12:53.163
...together.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.931
All right.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.807
-All right?
-Let's go for it.

12:58.978 --> 13:02.436
Well, we could dance around it
a little first.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.913
No. Let's be bad, George.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.644
-Let's be really bad.
-Whoa, easy.

13:11.657 --> 13:15.991
-So how come you're selling it?
-You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.187
-How many miles?
-Two.

13:18.831 --> 13:19.957
City or highway?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.362
Look, do you really wanna buy
this thing or what?

13:22.535 --> 13:25.026
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
I'm not gonna be pressured.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.535
I'll walk away right now.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.737
Is this thing bent?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.740
-I'm not paying for that.
-All right, just get out of here.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.941
All right. Look, I'm gonna be honest.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.382
I'm very interested in the van.

13:41.554 --> 13:46.048
Okay, fine. What do I have to do
to put you in this van today?

13:46.225 --> 13:49.217
Well, I don't really have any money,
but it says right here:

13:49.395 --> 13:51.090
Interesting trades considered?

13:51.263 --> 13:54.289
-You put that in.
-Glad, I did.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.058
Here.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.098
You wanna trade me an undershirt?

13:58.270 --> 14:02.366
No, I want to trade you screen legend
Anthony Quinn's undershirt.

14:02.541 --> 14:06.238
He took this off to do sit-ups
in the park and I nabbed it.

14:06.779 --> 14:10.840
-That's disgusting.
-Well, that's my final offer.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.086
You dumped me for some idiotic
TV pitchman?

14:16.889 --> 14:19.619
I'm sorry, Puddy. It was a mistake.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.692
Let's just, let's just put it
behind us...

14:21.861 --> 14:25.092
...and we can continue
as if this never happened.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.459
Jeez, I don't know.
What if we're out somewhere...

14:27.633 --> 14:29.931
...and you see
the Maytag Repairman?

14:31.403 --> 14:34.236
-You're not taking me back?
-That's right.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.407
He's not idiotic.

14:36.575 --> 14:40.011
He's the Wiz.
And nobody beats him.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.910
Nobody.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.512
Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.117
Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.783
Why does this dummy have a bucket
on his head?

14:52.958 --> 14:55.119
Because we're blind to their tyranny.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.989
Shouldn't you
be wearing the bucket?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.053
Yeah. Move along, Betty.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.064
Is this Jerry Seinfeld's van?

15:03.969 --> 15:07.769
Not anymore. He traded it to me
for some Hollywood memorabilia.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.735
-I'm so stupid.
-What?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.140
I'm so stupid. Excuse-- I'm sorry.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.947
Hey, nice to meet you.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.644
She's into it?

15:19.818 --> 15:22.582
She's leaving me dirty messages
on my answering machine.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.916
So have your parents
found out about it?

15:26.091 --> 15:29.185
She wants to keep it quiet. She thinks
we have a real future together.

15:29.361 --> 15:30.988
It's a brave new world, all right.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.593
Hey, guys.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.829
Hey, how's the anti-mail
campaign going?

15:37.002 --> 15:40.460
Oh, boy, it's fantastic. We were out
in front of the post office today...

15:40.639 --> 15:42.334
...and not one person went in.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.975
It's Sunday.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.675
Why is the mailman
wearing a bucket?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.448
Well, it symbolizes our persecution.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.312
Shouldn't you be
wearing the bucket?

15:54.987 --> 15:56.852
Hey, I want my van keys back.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.890
Well, I thought we made a deal
for Quinn's T-shirt?

16:01.060 --> 16:02.357
Are you insane?

16:02.895 --> 16:04.362
-Give them.
-No, I can't. I can't.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.191
See, I told Frank he could borrow it.

16:06.365 --> 16:09.027
Yeah, he wants to move some
of George's stuff into storage.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.134
Wait a minute.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.703
He's picking up the van tonight?
This is perfect.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.806
I'll drive Rhisa
to someplace romantic...

16:15.975 --> 16:17.966
...then when my father slides
the door open...

16:18.143 --> 16:21.374
...I'm in the van
kissing his brother's daughter.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.776
Jerry, one of your friends came by...

16:23.949 --> 16:26.076
...and he was very upset
that I had your wheels.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.411
Oh, no, not Frankie.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.384
I didn't catch his name,
but he went running into the park.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.050
Oh, no, the woods, the hole.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.864
-Hey.
-Kramer, what the hell are you doing?

16:41.033 --> 16:43.866
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket
to something else.

16:44.036 --> 16:46.266
-Not that.
-What?

16:46.438 --> 16:47.598
You're in trouble, Kramer.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.367
I shouldn't be talking to you.
I'm telling you as a friend.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.839
Here's how it's gonna happen.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.174
You may be walking, maybe on
a crisp autumn day just like today...

16:55.347 --> 16:58.111
...when a mail truck will slow
beside you, the door will open.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.582
A mailman you know, maybe even
trust, will offer to give you a lift.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.187
-Are you through?
-No.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.050
And no one will ever see you again.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.317
-Are you through?
-Yes.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.017
No, wait.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.525
Okay, yes.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.433
-Quick. Get in.
-Oh, no, no, no.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.902
That's exactly how you said
it was going down.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.801
There's another way.
It's going down now!

17:22.974 --> 17:26.705
No, you said a mailman I know,
and you're a mailman I know.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.677
I know you know,
but you don't know what I know.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.111
Frankie?

17:33.285 --> 17:34.582
Frankie?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.887
Frankie?

17:37.589 --> 17:39.386
Frankie, is that you?

17:39.558 --> 17:40.786
My name is Edgar.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.294
Have a nice night.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.226
Thank you.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.861
Stupid.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.628
So stupid.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.099
Jerry?

17:58.444 --> 18:00.639
All right, George.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.180
I'm ready.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.113
Yeah, hold on. I'm--

18:06.285 --> 18:09.413
I'm just trying to get a reading
on my dashboard compass.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.751
Where are my parents?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.586
Georgie.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.958
Is this Seinfeld's van?
Seinfeld's van. Seinfeld's van.

18:19.698 --> 18:22.292
-Wait. What's he saying?
-I think he's saying Son of Sam.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.299
-Oh, my God!
-I thought they caught him.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.529
I knew it wasn't Berkowitz.

18:31.243 --> 18:35.202
So I told him, hit the road,
I'm going back with Jack.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.010
That's the second good piece
of news I've gotten.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.674
Really? What was the first?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.622
They're bringing me back.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.122
Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.884
What?

18:49.628 --> 18:52.688
I'm the Wiz. I'm the Wiz.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.299
What--? What about
your fact-checking job?

18:55.467 --> 18:59.028
Oh, here's a fact. I'm the Wiz.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.909
I'm the Wiz and nobody beats me.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.737
Frankie. Come on out of there.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.310
-You hate the van.
-But I'm keeping it.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.217
As much as I hate the idea
of being a van guy...

19:15.387 --> 19:19.153
...it's a lot better than hanging out here
with the nocturnal dirt people.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.320
So can we go for a ride?

19:21.493 --> 19:24.587
Yeah, let's just
get the hell out of here.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.758
Are you done with that?

19:35.974 --> 19:38.408
Good. He left the door unlocked.

19:38.577 --> 19:42.035
Why did Kramer have to
park the van in the woods?

19:42.214 --> 19:46.116
Isn't it obvious? There are
no parking meters out here.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.012
Hey, look at this.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.921
Hoochie mama.

19:59.598 --> 20:02.761
Oh, my goodness,
what have they done to you here?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.333
Who are you?

20:06.505 --> 20:07.972
Well--

20:08.407 --> 20:10.534
You can just call me Henry.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.906
Henry Atkins,
the postmaster general?

20:14.079 --> 20:15.444
Last time I checked.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.809
Henry, can I get out of here now?

20:18.984 --> 20:20.451
Oh, oh, sit a bit.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.711
Sit a bit.

20:21.887 --> 20:26.085
I mean, after all, I drove all the way
up here from D.C. just to talk to you.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.252
I even had to cancel a round of golf
with the secretary of state.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.488
Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.831
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.993
Mr. Kramer, I've been reading some
of your material here.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.729
I gotta be honest with you.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.500
You make a pretty strong case.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.165
I mean, just imagine.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.939
An army of men in wool pants,
running through the neighborhood...

20:49.114 --> 20:53.448
...handing out pottery catalogs
door to door.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.982
Well, it's my job...

20:58.790 --> 21:00.951
...and I'm pretty damn serious about it.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.553
In addition to being a postmaster...

21:04.863 --> 21:08.492
...I'm a general and we both know...

21:08.667 --> 21:12.967
...it's the job of a general to,
by God, get things done.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.334
So maybe you can understand...

21:16.842 --> 21:21.006
...why I get a little irritated when
somebody calls me away from my golf.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.545
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.615
Sure, you're sorry.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.878
I think we got a stack of mail there
at the desk that belongs to you.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.045
Now you want that mail,
don't you, Mr. Kramer?

21:31.223 --> 21:32.690
Sure do.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.053
-Now that's better.
-All right.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.224
Newman?

21:42.601 --> 21:45.035
Tell the world my story.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.209
-Hey, George.
-Jerry.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.781
-Hey, that's the guy.
-What?

21:58.950 --> 22:00.645
George Costanza. Frankie Merman.

22:02.354 --> 22:03.412
The summer me.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.613
The winter me.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.386
You must be George's cousin.

22:07.793 --> 22:08.919
Girlfriend.

22:09.728 --> 22:10.854
All right.

22:12.564 --> 22:13.656
Hey, what is that?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.166
That van's a-rocking.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.669
Then don't go a-knocking.

22:21.506 --> 22:25.602
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God!

22:25.877 --> 22:27.845
Oh, you gotta sell this van.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.742
Oh, yeah.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.821
What you saw in the van
was a natural expression...

22:40.992 --> 22:42.584
...of a man's love for his lady.

22:44.963 --> 22:48.126
Your father's right. It's beautiful.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.631
And it was safe.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.235
Oh, God.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.873
Now if you'll excuse me,
once again...

22:56.041 --> 22:59.807
-...your mother and l--
-Oh, make it stop.
