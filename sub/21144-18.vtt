I'm so excited for you
to finally meet

03:12.626 --> 03:13.400
my childhood best friend!

03:13.477 --> 03:15.143
Please don't read into my words,

03:15.220 --> 03:16.645
or tone,

03:16.721 --> 03:17.553
but how long is she staying?

03:17.631 --> 03:18.980
When is she leaving?

03:19.057 --> 03:20.337
And does this smile look forced?

03:21.652 --> 03:24.077
Frankie, you know
what a big part of my life

03:24.154 --> 03:25.728
Izzy was before I met you.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.581
I want the three of us
to hang out!

03:27.658 --> 03:28.807
Three of us?

03:28.809 --> 03:29.750
Why not just go to four of us

03:29.826 --> 03:31.106
and include the knife
in my back?

03:33.571 --> 03:35.497
Frankie, there's no reason
to be jealous.

03:35.573 --> 03:37.240
She's just here for a week.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.926
Besides, I only have
one best friend,

03:39.002 --> 03:40.594
and it's you.

03:40.671 --> 03:42.154
Paige, that was totally cheesy

03:42.156 --> 03:43.505
and exactly what
I needed to hear.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.083
P-Zizzle!

03:47.161 --> 03:48.994
I-Swizzle!

♪ Uns, uns, uns, uns ♪

03:52.666 --> 03:53.666
Both: Ah!

03:55.686 --> 03:57.611
Izzy, this is Frankie.

03:57.688 --> 03:59.929
Hi. Uh, nice to meet you.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.449
A handshake? What am I, your uncle?
Get in here!

04:02.526 --> 04:04.934
Oh! Oh, wow! Okay.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.455
Uh, I forgot to mention, Izzy gets
super touchy when she's excited.

04:08.532 --> 04:10.031
- I do not!
- Oh!

04:10.108 --> 04:10.773
Can you believe this chick?

04:10.851 --> 04:13.293
Ow! So tiny, so strong.

04:14.946 --> 04:16.288
Look at all your cool props.

04:17.949 --> 04:20.950
Hey, a tea cup.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.173
Remember that time we rode the teacups
so many times we puked everywhere?

04:23.197 --> 04:25.639
Ew! Totally!

04:25.716 --> 04:27.199
We ate blue cotton candy
the entire day,

04:27.201 --> 04:30.385
then threw up in our hair!

04:30.462 --> 04:32.429
Both: Blue hair, don't care!
(giggles)

04:34.891 --> 04:37.709
Uh... you know,

04:37.711 --> 04:39.469
Frankie had blue hair once.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.562
It was a medical thing.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.490
Oh. (Chuckles)

04:43.567 --> 04:45.567
Hey, remember when
we played truth or dare

04:45.643 --> 04:48.978
and I dared you to see
my dentist pretending to be me

04:49.056 --> 04:50.555
and she gave you braces?

04:50.557 --> 04:51.740
That dentist went to jail!

04:51.816 --> 04:53.116
- Yeah!
- (both laughing)

04:57.064 --> 04:59.914
Um... you know, uh,

04:59.991 --> 05:03.068
Frankie almost got braces.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.753
Yeah. Then I... I didn't.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.089
I like you, you're funny.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.832
Thank you,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.176
I-Swizzle.

05:12.262 --> 05:14.337
What the heck was that?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.023
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.243
- Now I'm just messing with ya.
- I... Oh.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.309
How are you so strong?

05:24.258 --> 05:26.682
"It's not about the destination,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.985
it's about the Bernie."

05:31.265 --> 05:32.205
Yeah, I'll use that
for something.

05:32.282 --> 05:34.115
(door opens)

05:34.192 --> 05:37.602
Bernard, I have some news
about your Great Uncle.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.937
I have a Great Uncle?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.939
Not anymore, he died.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.374
He sent you that card.

05:46.371 --> 05:49.114
"Dearest Bernard,
I am your Great Uncle Herschel.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.967
"As I look back on my life, I regret never
taking you on any memorable adventures.

05:53.044 --> 05:55.378
"But I want you to have
adventures of your own,

05:55.456 --> 05:56.712
"so I'm leaving you some money.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.715
The most important thing
I learned in life..."

05:59.793 --> 06:01.113
Whatever!
How much money do I get?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.072
One million dollars?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.634
Now I can do everything
I've always wanted to do.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.320
Eat my feet, jerk nozzles,

06:12.397 --> 06:13.822
'cause Bernie Schotz is rich!

06:16.734 --> 06:19.828
Hey Amelia,
you missed your chance

06:19.904 --> 06:22.422
'cause now I'm loaded,
you shallow diva.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.168
You wear a horse face,

06:27.245 --> 06:28.420
and I think that's stupid!

06:31.249 --> 06:32.748
Viking Guy,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.751
you're a sad, old, failure who
created a make-believe character

06:35.829 --> 06:39.347
because you're so upset with
your life and personality

06:39.424 --> 06:41.424
that you have to live
as someone else.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.610
Well, that wasn't very...

06:43.687 --> 06:44.687
Oh, my gosh. He's right.

06:46.431 --> 06:48.097
I'm rich, I'm rich!

06:48.175 --> 06:49.616
I'm rich, I'm rich!

06:49.693 --> 06:50.450
I'm rich, I'm rich!

06:50.527 --> 06:54.571
I'm better than everybody!

06:57.684 --> 06:59.075
(sighs)

07:01.446 --> 07:03.964
That was the greatest day
of my life.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.857
Hey, Bernie,
how'd ya like my prank?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.083
What?

07:09.713 --> 07:11.023
That fake card
with that fake check.

07:11.047 --> 07:13.131
(chuckles) Pretty funny, right?

07:14.535 --> 07:15.925
Oh, no.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.482
Man, I love your school.
It's awesome.

07:22.559 --> 07:25.635
Aw, thanks. Oh, hey, I have
the best idea for tonight.

07:25.712 --> 07:29.322
You, me, and Frankie should go
to Stevenson's Ice Cream

07:29.399 --> 07:30.973
and order their
three person sundae.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.362
- Izzy: Whoa! That looks amazing!
- Paige: Right?

07:32.386 --> 07:33.493
What do they call it?

07:33.570 --> 07:35.570
The three person sundae.

07:35.647 --> 07:37.055
Well, that's boring.
I'm calling it

07:37.057 --> 07:38.723
the thrundae!

07:38.725 --> 07:39.725
The thrundae!

07:41.228 --> 07:42.502
Hey, guys.

07:42.579 --> 07:46.006
Hey! We just came up with
the best plan for tonight.

07:46.082 --> 07:49.918
Me, you, Izzy,
and a three person sundae.

07:49.994 --> 07:53.572
Ooh, you know what, I would love to spend
tonight bloated and filled with regret,

07:53.574 --> 07:56.850
but I was gonna check out
the L.A. Horror Movie Festival.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.501
I would have invited you,

07:58.579 --> 07:59.647
but I know you hate
horror movies.

07:59.671 --> 08:02.597
I actually love horror movies.

08:02.674 --> 08:03.910
I've been dying
to go to that fest.

08:03.934 --> 08:06.676
Oh, really?

08:06.753 --> 08:09.362
You know, since Izzy loves
horror movies,

08:09.439 --> 08:11.439
and you love horror movies,

08:11.516 --> 08:14.609
and there's
a horror movie festival...

08:14.686 --> 08:16.595
I think she wants us
to go together.

08:16.597 --> 08:20.432
Yeah, I love her
but she's not subtle.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.394
I know you guys are talking about me,
but I feel like things are happening!

08:24.454 --> 08:25.937
All right, let's do it.

08:25.939 --> 08:26.955
Oh, yay!

08:27.031 --> 08:28.790
Go, have fun!

08:28.866 --> 08:31.718
I'll pick up the sundae, and we can
meet up at Vuuugle after. Nine p.m.?

08:31.795 --> 08:32.795
Sounds good.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.465
(laughter)

08:53.467 --> 08:54.966
- Oh, Paige, over here!
- Hey, Paige!

08:54.968 --> 08:55.984
Hey.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.485
Oh, ugh.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.228
Where have you guys been?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.414
Oh, my gosh!

09:01.491 --> 09:03.286
We're so sorry,
we totally lost track of time.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.591
You know what? It's okay. Don't
worry about it. Let's eat.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.997
Oh, no, the sundae.

09:09.073 --> 09:12.425
- It looks like...
- Both: The melted body of Dr. Slice Face!

09:13.987 --> 09:15.745
It's a long story.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.265
In the movie,
Dr. Slice Face melts.

09:20.844 --> 09:22.324
I guess it's not
that long of a story.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.163
Wow.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.158
You guys had a good time, huh?

09:26.182 --> 09:28.516
Yeah! You were right,
I love this girl.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.172
Both: Zucchini!

09:34.174 --> 09:35.523
It's a long...

09:35.600 --> 09:38.026
Long story, got it.

09:38.102 --> 09:39.953
Well, uh, we're all here now.
Let's dig in.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.682
(phones chime)

09:43.684 --> 09:45.274
(beeps)

09:45.352 --> 09:46.685
No way.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.020
Did you just get that alert?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.446
About the surprise
screening of...

09:50.524 --> 09:52.524
Both: Tongue Ripper Five? Ah!

09:52.526 --> 09:54.928
Wait. But I haven't seen Tongue
Ripper Four. What happens in it?

09:54.952 --> 09:56.044
They rip out tongues.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
Sweet, I'm caught up.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.365
Oh, wait, it's tonight.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.383
Oh, yeah, forget about it.
We're here to hang out.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.311
Huh?

10:04.387 --> 10:06.128
No, no, no. Don't forget it.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.129
You guys should totally go.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.223
Are you sure?

10:09.300 --> 10:11.278
'Cause you're dragging out your words and
I'm thinking it might mean something.

10:11.302 --> 10:14.321
What? No!

10:14.397 --> 10:17.157
Go!

10:17.233 --> 10:19.400
Okay. Thanks, Paige.

10:19.477 --> 10:20.943
- You're the best.
- Love you, P-Ziz.

10:23.557 --> 10:27.575
Yeah, I'll just be here

10:27.652 --> 10:29.827
drinking this melted sundae
all by myself.

10:31.748 --> 10:32.830
(slurps)

10:34.417 --> 10:35.675
Hey, guys! I'm Paige.

10:35.752 --> 10:37.326
And I'm Frankie.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.806
You know, applying makeup
can be an art form.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.739
Mixing just the right amount

10:40.741 --> 10:42.423
of lipstick and blush

10:42.500 --> 10:44.017
to make you look
and feel amazing.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.577
It can also be a train wreck

10:45.579 --> 10:46.853
if you wear a blindfold.

10:46.930 --> 10:49.672
(gasps) Ooh, that sounds
way more fun. Let's do that.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.751
I'm gonna start out with the foundation.
Where's your face?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.752
- I'm just gonna...
- Uh-huh.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.511
Just guess a little bit.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.772
This feels like a yellow.

10:57.849 --> 10:59.774
- It's a yellow, right?
- It's so yellow, guys.

10:59.851 --> 11:01.868
- It's so yellow.
- Okay, well, I'm guessing

11:01.945 --> 11:03.664
it's not a yellow
from the tone of your voice.

11:03.688 --> 11:04.688
There we go.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.374
- One...
- Both: Two, three.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.267
(both gasp)

11:09.269 --> 11:11.360
- Oh, my gosh!
- You look amazing!

11:11.438 --> 11:12.620
I think you did great.

11:12.697 --> 11:14.196
Ooh!

11:14.274 --> 11:16.457
- All right, here we go.
- (laughs)

11:16.534 --> 11:18.276
- This is a pencil.
- Yeah.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.279
- I'm gonna do your eyebrows. Yes.
- Oh, you're gonna do my eyebrows?

11:21.281 --> 11:24.373
You're drawing a new set
of eyebrows just for me.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.059
(both laughing)

11:26.136 --> 11:28.970
- Because you want some luscious lips.
- Oh!

11:29.046 --> 11:30.600
Oh, yeah, that's a
little bit overdrawn.

11:30.624 --> 11:31.806
Both: Go!

11:31.883 --> 11:32.883
Ah! (Laughs)

11:34.644 --> 11:36.886
- I look...
- Oh, no!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.738
I have a new set of eyebrows.

11:38.815 --> 11:41.482
- I've got to arch my furry eyebrows.
- Pucker.

11:45.655 --> 11:48.990
You know, I just wanted
Frankie and Izzy to get along.

11:49.066 --> 11:52.368
I didn't think they'd get
so close, I'd feel left out.

11:53.814 --> 11:54.912
Amelia?

11:58.910 --> 12:00.760
I'm so sorry.

12:00.837 --> 12:02.336
Were you speaking
to my hologram?

12:02.413 --> 12:03.713
Uh...

12:05.826 --> 12:07.492
Hologram?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.511
Yeah. Well, I was
gonna get a dog.

12:10.588 --> 12:11.888
But this is way cuter.

12:15.092 --> 12:17.685
Wait, you weren't saying
anything important, were ya?

12:17.762 --> 12:19.762
Nope.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.949
Just feeling alone,
talking to a fake person.

12:23.026 --> 12:25.026
That's what my mom
says to me too.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.681
Hey!

12:29.683 --> 12:31.958
So, how was the movie?

12:32.035 --> 12:33.275
Did all the tongues get ripped?

12:35.021 --> 12:38.280
Paige, there is so much
more to it than that.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.791
They also ripped out throats.

12:41.711 --> 12:43.361
Where my Frizzle at?

12:43.363 --> 12:44.362
Right hizzle!

12:44.364 --> 12:46.288
Horror hug!

12:46.366 --> 12:48.123
(both screaming)

12:48.201 --> 12:49.425
Both: Ah, ah, ah! (Gasping)

12:51.538 --> 12:54.630
Yeah, I want in on this!

12:54.708 --> 12:56.265
Stab, stab, stab!
Paige is fun too!

12:58.803 --> 13:00.469
So, what should
we all do tonight?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.137
Uh, what about mini-golf?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.193
- Perfect!
- Oh, but it's supposed to rain tonight.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.492
It can't rain!

13:05.568 --> 13:07.309
I mean, um...

13:07.387 --> 13:10.980
That... That's okay. My cousin
has an indoor mini-golf set.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.724
I'll go get it
and set it up in the lounge.

13:12.726 --> 13:13.983
Meet me back here at 7:00?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.060
- Cool. See ya.
- Awesome.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.565
Amelia, I did it!

13:20.567 --> 13:23.735
Me, Frankie, and Izzy are all
gonna go mini-golfing together

13:23.737 --> 13:25.069
and I won't feel
left out at all!

13:25.071 --> 13:27.755
Do you want to hear
the song I sing when I feel joy?

13:27.832 --> 13:29.682
Uh... I'm a hologram.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.418
So...

13:41.012 --> 13:42.019
some things were said...

13:43.590 --> 13:45.606
regrets were had,

13:45.683 --> 13:47.043
but I can tell
we're all good here.

13:51.114 --> 13:52.597
Cool, cool.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.784
So, I'm gonna go grab some
tostadas if anyone's interested.

13:56.861 --> 14:00.772
You said I was a "shallow diva."

14:00.774 --> 14:02.054
And there's just no truth to it.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.304
There's definitely
no money, right?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.554
No truth!

14:07.630 --> 14:11.707
Your harsh words made me
challenge my life choices!

14:11.785 --> 14:14.060
And Horse Face Guy
still hasn't recovered.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.309
Let's just punch him!

14:21.385 --> 14:22.627
- Group: Yeah!
- No, guys, wait!

14:22.629 --> 14:24.629
It was my grandma!

14:24.631 --> 14:26.776
She pranked me with a fake letter that
said I inherited a million dollars.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.301
(quiet chattering) - She did
that to her own grandson?

14:30.303 --> 14:34.581
I can sense your anger
is shifting away from me here,

14:34.657 --> 14:36.641
so I have a proposal.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.645
Let's pull a revenge prank on
Grandma and teach her a lesson!

14:40.647 --> 14:42.663
- Group: Yeah!
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

14:42.740 --> 14:46.909
What if her grandson
mysteriously disappeared?

14:46.987 --> 14:50.096
What? No!

14:50.173 --> 14:51.322
Jeez, just trying
to get the ball rolling.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.423
What's this guy's deal?

14:57.831 --> 14:59.439
Are you ready? Are you ready?

14:59.515 --> 15:01.682
You told us it was mini-golf.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.592
It's mini-golf!

15:03.670 --> 15:07.262
Whoa! This looks amazing!

15:07.340 --> 15:08.484
It must have taken you
hours to set up.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.116
Oh, it was nothing.

15:10.193 --> 15:13.119
I'm just so happy the three of us
are finally hanging out together.

15:13.196 --> 15:15.236
Well, I can't wait to give it
my official golf clap.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.367
Golf! Whoo!

15:19.443 --> 15:20.443
Golf!

15:22.446 --> 15:24.038
Great. So, who wants
to go first?

15:24.115 --> 15:28.192
Oh, wait, before we start, we have
something awesome to show you.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.554
While you were
setting all this up,

15:29.620 --> 15:33.622
we were hanging out and came up
with a hilarious idea

15:33.700 --> 15:35.694
so we made a video.
We can't wait for you to see it.

15:35.718 --> 15:36.758
- (screen turns on)
- What?

15:37.962 --> 15:38.719

15:38.796 --> 15:40.980

17:00.211 --> 17:01.786
You made a video without me?

17:01.788 --> 17:05.231
Yeah! We thought you'd love it.
It's like something we would do.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.399
Yeah.

17:06.476 --> 17:09.051
It is something we would do.

17:09.129 --> 17:13.239
Hey. Hey, where are you going?
I thought we were hanging out.

17:13.316 --> 17:14.626
But you and Izzy
are such great friends.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.317
You won't even know I'm gone.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.065
Hey, guys, Bernie here

17:23.143 --> 17:24.475
with Amelia and Viking Guy.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.811
Have you ever eaten
a donut and thought

17:26.813 --> 17:28.570
"Man, this is great,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.982
but I wish my fingertips
weren't so messy?"

17:30.984 --> 17:32.833
Everyday, girlfriend. Everyday.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.475
Well, today,
we are playing the...

17:38.007 --> 17:39.607
A game where we
hang donuts from a string

17:39.659 --> 17:42.343
and try to eat them with our
hands tied behind our backs.

17:42.419 --> 17:43.844
You said it, girlfriend!

17:43.921 --> 17:46.439
- Cut it out.
- Oh.

17:46.516 --> 17:49.225
First one to eat their donut
without it falling wins.

17:52.688 --> 17:54.438
(grunting)

17:56.859 --> 17:58.526
- No! Wait!
- Oh, no!

17:58.602 --> 17:59.844
- Ah!
- Ha, ha, ha!

17:59.846 --> 18:00.846
This is not fair!

18:05.442 --> 18:07.368
- No! No!
- Oh!

18:07.444 --> 18:08.519
- (buzzer)
- It fell.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.130
No, stop! Thats... Ow!

18:11.207 --> 18:12.207
- (buzzer)
- Ow!

18:13.693 --> 18:17.461
I win! I win! I win! I... Whoa!

18:21.868 --> 18:22.958
Hey, are you okay?

18:23.036 --> 18:24.718
No, I'm not okay.

18:24.795 --> 18:28.147
Look, I didn't know making a video
with Izzy would make you so upset.

18:28.224 --> 18:30.041
No, this isn't just
about the video.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.317
This is about sundae night.

18:31.394 --> 18:34.136
Sunday night? I didn't even
see you Sunday night.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.874
No, not Sunday night,
sundae night. The ice cream.

18:35.898 --> 18:37.639
Oh, sundae night.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.717
Go on.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.311
You shouldn't have gone back
to that horror fest with Izzy.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.071
Wait, that's what this is about?

18:44.148 --> 18:45.556
I waited an hour for you guys

18:45.558 --> 18:48.817
and you show up for, like,
two minutes and then ditch me.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.910
You said go.

18:49.987 --> 18:52.563
No, I said "go!"

18:52.565 --> 18:56.083
A good friend would have
known I meant don't go.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.071
Oh! So I'm not a good friend
because I can't read your mind?

19:00.073 --> 19:02.515
Why don't I just write
a Paige to English dictionary?

19:02.592 --> 19:04.242
Go means "don't go."

19:04.244 --> 19:06.405
Be friends with Izzy means
"don't be friends with Izzy."

19:06.429 --> 19:08.982
And everything else means "I don't
know, I'm Paige and I'm a lunatic"

19:09.006 --> 19:10.006
and I make no sense!"

19:12.509 --> 19:16.770
Yeah, well, I wrote the Frankie
to English dictionary.

19:16.847 --> 19:19.235
All the pages are blank because
you're oblivious and lack emotion.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.702
Well, if it's blank, then why
would you print it, Paige?

19:22.778 --> 19:24.704
Your company
would go out of business.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.758
Well, some people might buy
a book to put on their bookshelf

19:26.782 --> 19:30.434
so that when other people
come over, they look smart!

19:30.436 --> 19:33.195
- What are we fighting about?
- I don't know!

19:33.273 --> 19:34.600
Look, you're the one who begged
me to become friends with Izzy.

19:34.624 --> 19:37.108
Yeah?

19:37.110 --> 19:38.776
Well, I don't see anyone begging
you to be here right now.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.778
(scoffs)

19:47.287 --> 19:49.470
Okay, Grandma's almost home.

19:49.546 --> 19:51.622
Remember, we hide
behind the furniture,

19:51.624 --> 19:53.424
then jump out and scare her
when she comes in.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.902
She's here! Get in position.

19:55.978 --> 19:56.978
Go, go, go, go!

20:04.228 --> 20:06.137
(humming quietly)

20:06.139 --> 20:07.729
Now!

20:07.807 --> 20:08.730
(grunting)

20:08.808 --> 20:09.916
Ah!

20:09.992 --> 20:11.492
(both shouting)

20:13.329 --> 20:15.146
(groans)

20:15.148 --> 20:17.148
Nobody breaks into Roz's crib.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.816
Oh!

20:18.818 --> 20:20.575
Grandma, wait!

20:20.653 --> 20:22.820
"Grandma"?
You calling me old, punk?

20:22.822 --> 20:24.597
(Bernie screams)

20:24.674 --> 20:26.590
Grandma:
Ooh! This feels like a face.

20:27.843 --> 20:29.268
Ah!

20:29.345 --> 20:30.345
(groans)

20:36.760 --> 20:38.593
Ah!

20:38.671 --> 20:41.021
All right,
I'm getting out of here!

20:41.098 --> 20:42.673
Bernie: Oh, thank goodness.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.595
Grandma: And coming back
with my violent friends.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.271
(all groaning)

20:49.349 --> 20:50.957
It hurts.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.199
- It hurts.
- Ow!

20:52.276 --> 20:54.460
Take that, Grandma.

21:02.286 --> 21:03.544
Hey.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.620
Hey.

21:06.382 --> 21:08.382
Look, uh...

21:08.459 --> 21:10.368
I know I said some awful things,

21:10.370 --> 21:13.053
and I'm sorry.

21:13.130 --> 21:16.090
Just to be clear, in the Paige dictionary,
that actually means "I'm sorry."

21:17.877 --> 21:19.226
I'm sorry too.

21:19.303 --> 21:20.486
I hate when we fight.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.972
Paige, what happened?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.050
I don't know.

21:26.143 --> 21:27.143
I got jealous.

21:28.479 --> 21:30.162
It's just...

21:30.239 --> 21:33.982
in three days, you guys
have come up with

21:34.060 --> 21:38.078
bits and inside jokes and nicknames that
took you and me years to find together.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.493
And then when I saw
that video you guys made,

21:42.568 --> 21:44.418
it was awesome.

21:44.495 --> 21:46.128
And everybody loved it.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.740
And I realized...

21:51.761 --> 21:52.761
I'm replaceable.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
Replaceable?

21:57.508 --> 22:01.268
You remember the first time
we had lunch together?

22:01.345 --> 22:05.423
I said I was waiting for
my friend Jessica to show up.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.525
- Yeah.
- Well, there was no Jessica. I made her up.

22:10.279 --> 22:12.872
I never told you this before,
but you were the first friend

22:12.948 --> 22:13.948
I ever made.

22:15.284 --> 22:17.043
Frankie.

22:17.119 --> 22:23.382
Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm
not the best at meeting new people.

22:23.459 --> 22:25.609
You were the first person
to help me open up.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.888
You were the first person who gave
me the confidence to be myself.

22:28.964 --> 22:31.706
You were the first person
who thought making a video

22:31.784 --> 22:34.376
about a talking toilet
was a good idea.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.053
Mr. Potty-Mouth
was revolutionary.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.809
So I don't know how
you can say you're replaceable

22:41.885 --> 22:43.565
when you've shaped me
into the person I am.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.571
You're my best friend, Paige.

22:48.058 --> 22:49.149
I'm not me without you.

22:50.894 --> 22:51.894
Hey.

22:56.309 --> 22:59.034
Aw! Stuff was said.

23:00.329 --> 23:01.329
Yeah, it was.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.406
I'm sorry if I've been
acting weird.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.502
Paige, you don't have to apologize for
the last five years of your life.

23:08.579 --> 23:11.263
Oh!

23:11.340 --> 23:12.656
Hey, so what should
the three of us do tonight?

23:12.658 --> 23:14.550
Guys, I got it covered.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.938
(Frankie laughs)

23:19.014 --> 23:20.106
(chuckles) No way.

23:23.093 --> 23:24.017
Presenting...

23:24.094 --> 23:25.227
the thrundae!

23:27.173 --> 23:28.173
Frankie and Paige: Oh.

23:30.343 --> 23:31.343
It doesn't travel well.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.512
- Okay.
- (Paige giggles)

23:34.514 --> 23:36.938
I'm sorry, but it has been
three days

23:37.016 --> 23:43.003
and no one has said anything
about my bangs.
