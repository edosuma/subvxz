00:00.010 --> 00:04.230
Are you guys minted off
these internships, or what?

00:04.280 --> 00:07.680
- What sort of work do you do there?
- Coffees and photocopying.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.310
People are going to say
stupid things about Fay.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.870
But if you knew her,
you knew Fay was strong.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.160
Are you one of them?

00:19.440 --> 00:22.160
You've offered me your
advice, so I'm taking it.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.430
That is Lukas Steiner.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.190
Steiner was Fay's catch.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.230
- So, they're competing for her job?
- You're not like them!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.189
Did anyone tell you what happened to Fay?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.710
- Get her the fuck out of here.
- Who did this?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.870
- They were my friends.
- But you fell out?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.230
Because of what you did?

00:38.280 --> 00:39.710
Why did you come tonight?

00:39.760 --> 00:42.910
- I want in.
- So, you're in.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.960
- What?
- You heard me.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.950
♪ You, you

00:48.000 --> 00:51.480
♪ You give me hopes again
And now I have no choice

01:51.640 --> 01:53.120
Uh-huh. OK.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.150
Yeah.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.640
She's here with me now.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.200
Yeah, the new intern.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.320
No problem.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.760
Sorry, if you could just take a seat?

02:08.120 --> 02:11.510
Oh, wait. This was couriered
in for you this morning.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.960
Thanks.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.150
Holly.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.630
So, your first week's just about
getting to know the company

02:20.680 --> 02:22.350
and what the different departments do.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.870
After that, you'll be placed where
we think you're best suited.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.070
Now, the boss lives up there.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.990
So, you're going to see
the bigger clients go up

02:28.040 --> 02:30.710
and the employees attached to their
accounts, but apart from that,

02:30.760 --> 02:33.230
- it's out of bounds,
OK? - Sure. - Right.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.150
Can I just leave you to it from here?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.670
I've got a seriously
fucking busy morning ahead.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.560
- Yeah, of course.
- Fantastic.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.830
Oh, Holly.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.160
Bonne chance.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.070
Well, fuck me!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.710
- McStay!
- Who?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.560
You can bugger off, I'm busy now.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.390
Come on, then.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.710
So, you'll need to set up your work e-mail

03:32.760 --> 03:36.190
and then go through the ridiculous
Health and Safety videos.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.140
Come find me when you're done, yeah?

03:39.560 --> 03:42.990
- Are you missing lectures?
- It depends how late I need to stay.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.110
Let Jude know. She'll
talk to your professors

03:45.160 --> 03:46.910
and get the heat taken off, OK?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.120
OK.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.720
Are you one of them? What's your name?

04:52.400 --> 04:53.910
Hello?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.320
'Stalking me at work?'

04:56.920 --> 04:59.550
'You could have just called me, you know.'

04:59.600 --> 05:01.470
Where are you?

05:01.520 --> 05:02.760
'It's perfect.'

05:04.480 --> 05:06.670
'I can see you from my desk.'

05:06.720 --> 05:08.670
Gross.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.760
- Office clothes really suit you.
- I look like someone's mother.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.320
No mother I know.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.270
When do you do lunch?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.280
- Rory?
- Rory?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.880
This way, please.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.310
What were the police here for?

05:43.360 --> 05:46.470
James Buxton. Apparently, his
family can't get hold of him.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.880
He's missing?

05:50.320 --> 05:53.840
- This isn't like other
internships, is it? - Nope.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.710
Are you clever? Not top-of
your-sixth-form clever,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.760
I mean, properly clever?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.560
Probably not like you, Louise.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.030
Well, I'm not so good at
the other stuff. There.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.870
Hate me less now?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.480
- Other stuff?
- Relationship management.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.230
I've always wanted to be
on the Steiner account.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.110
Just never been given the chance.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.830
Slacking off already, girls?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.790
- Just giving Holly the run-through.
- Good to see you, Holly.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.470
- Feeling all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.110
Sorry about the fundraiser.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.550
Oh, God, don't worry. We've
all been there, believe me.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.830
- Is Steiner in today?
- Yep. On my way to him now.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.980
- I'm free...
- We're fine, thanks, Louise.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.150
He's probably just...

06:41.200 --> 06:43.900
I don't know what's a test
and what isn't with him.

07:56.980 --> 07:58.280
Come in, Elizabeth.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.960
Come in!

08:06.040 --> 08:07.200
Hello.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.350
What are you writing?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.790
Documenting your betrayal.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.350
What?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.350
I told you that information in good faith.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.800
About the girls?

08:27.760 --> 08:30.390
Elizabeth, that's not how I got in.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.390
Don't think you could argue it
didn't give you an advantage.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.710
OK. Fine.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.760
I'm sorry. You can still try for it.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.590
No, thanks, I've actually started

08:40.640 --> 08:42.750
to doubt their commitment
to student welfare.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.990
I think that's probably smart.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.790
- So, why are you doing it?
- It's complicated.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.590
Actually complicated or just something

08:49.640 --> 08:51.110
you don't want to talk to me about?

08:51.160 --> 08:52.910
I need to figure out what's going on.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.040
What Georgia's doing. No-one's
even talking about Fay.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.470
I'm guessing they're probably embarrassed

08:59.520 --> 09:01.550
by their lack of provisions
for intern stress.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.840
You don't get it.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.390
You know, it's weird. I hear that a lot.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.750
But I tend to be right.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.830
I actually tend to be pretty on the money.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.230
All right.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.910
What, you're glad you got
in cos you think it's cool

09:13.960 --> 09:16.910
and you want to be cool and cos
it drives you round the twist

09:16.960 --> 09:18.990
that they thought Georgia
was cooler than you?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.430
Think what you like, Elizabeth.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.560
I will.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.600
I'm sorry, OK?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
I know you wanted the internship.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.760
Here.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.680
Thanks.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.560
It's French knitting.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.440
Hello?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.280
Knock-knock.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.240
Feels weird, right?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.660
I didn't realise how shit my stuff is.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.240
Don't worry.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.400
This was Fay's room, wasn't it?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.440
- It's just a room.
- I know.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.360
Seriously, forget it, OK?

12:50.800 --> 12:51.960
OK.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.270
Any advice for the newbie?

12:57.320 --> 13:00.750
Just work your tits off all the time!

13:00.800 --> 13:03.670
Don't borrow Phoebe's
clothes. She'll cut you.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.390
And don't sleep with Louise.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.350
Straight girls having a
go at gay makes her sad.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.840
Understandable.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.600
Keep your head.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.120
Yeah.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.760
I mean it.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.200
Why did she do it?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.470
I don't know.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.320
Stupid bitch.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.920
Best friends. They fuck you every time.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.400
- Yours is particularly...
- Yeah, isn't she? - Bless her.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.160
I don't. I might kill her.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.750
Jude comes on Mondays.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.510
- To the house?
- Yeah.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.510
It's just dinner, mentoring stuff.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.880
Come for a drink first.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.280
Rachel?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.110
I know we're not that close,

14:19.160 --> 14:21.910
but I want you to know
that I'm always here,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.600
if you want to talk about...

14:25.400 --> 14:27.590
About Fay, you know?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.280
You'd have liked each other.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.550
I'm sure we would.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.050
She got it, like you.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.480
- Huh?
- I'm home!

14:37.680 --> 14:38.960
Rachel?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Alistair thought James went his
parents', but he didn't show.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.070
- Where's Georgia?
- She stayed with Charlie after work.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.590
He told me he was going
for drinks with the boys.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.310
Clever little Georgia.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.630
Oh, she's blatantly
gate-crashed boys' night.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.110
- So?
- So, we weren't invited.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.470
- Why not? - They think we're
going to report them to HR

15:01.520 --> 15:03.750
- for making a misogynist joke.
- Bingo.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.550
- What? They're scared of us?
- Absolutely.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.710
They're scared they get hauled
up for sexual harassment,

15:09.760 --> 15:11.790
or gender slurs, or mansplaining,

15:11.840 --> 15:14.070
or whatever great injustice
the internet mafia

15:14.120 --> 15:15.550
has gone mad about this week.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.190
- Those are real things, though.
- Yes, they are.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.790
But I think we're teaching women
to expect them at every turn.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.310
Class every man as a misogynist,

15:23.360 --> 15:25.990
you just end up creating
more actual misogynists.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.950
Stay away from internet comment
sections, Jude. Just a heads up.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.630
Apologies for not being
constantly offended enough

15:32.680 --> 15:34.510
for today's feminist argument.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.390
So, what is your argument?

15:36.440 --> 15:39.150
How do you expect to be in the
thick of things professionally

15:39.200 --> 15:41.190
if you're not there for the conversation?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.430
Oh, come on. Georgia's not
there talking about work.

15:44.480 --> 15:48.190
She's probably in the toilets
sucking someone's dick.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.480
Someone like Charlie Lamont-Smith?

15:52.960 --> 15:55.270
No. That's different.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.070
- Busted!
- Isn't...

15:58.120 --> 15:59.830
I'm not criticising you, Phoebe,

15:59.880 --> 16:02.830
I'm just pointing out
that two consenting adults

16:02.880 --> 16:05.030
who are working and sleeping together

16:05.080 --> 16:07.960
can sometimes be a productive combination.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.160
So... I forgot the day.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.960
Don't worry, come. Sit.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.150
You missed us cruelly intruding
on Phoebe's love life.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.310
Love life? She'd be lucky.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.280
Pot? Kettle? Racist?

16:27.520 --> 16:31.550
OK, so fuck 'em and then have a
post-coital chat about the markets?

16:32.760 --> 16:36.190
Talk to them. Don't treat
them like predators.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.030
Then, if you feel like
having sex with them,

16:40.080 --> 16:42.750
that's entirely your own business...

16:53.880 --> 16:56.670
You're not breathing out, you're
not breathing out. I know.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.750
It doesn't make sense, but you
need to blow the air away, OK?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.710
- You need to blow the air away. - OK!

17:03.440 --> 17:06.190
Breathe with me, it's OK, it's OK.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.670
Shh! Shh!

17:10.040 --> 17:11.710
Breathe with me.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.950
Shh. We're alone.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.720
This will stop soon, OK?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.640
We're alone and this will stop soon.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.760
Not now.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.480
This will stop soon.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.480
This will stop soon.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.040
OK.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.350
George, what's happened?

18:14.400 --> 18:16.430
I'm OK, I just...

18:16.480 --> 18:19.040
Panic attack. Lame.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.060
You got the Steiner account.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.680
- Didn't you?
- What?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.400
Fay's spot, you got it.

18:31.680 --> 18:32.880
Yeah.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.990
Are you going to be a dick about it?

18:36.040 --> 18:39.800
- George, this is...
- Really amazing. I know.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.910
- It's a big deal, but I
think I'm ready. - Really?

18:43.960 --> 18:45.660
I knew you'd be a dick about it.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.800
- It's just...
- Stuff's happening for me, Holly.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.840
Don't you fucking ruin it, OK?

19:32.400 --> 19:36.070
♪ .. Know that it doesn't hurt me?

19:36.120 --> 19:40.390
♪ Do you wanna hear about
the deal that I'm making?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.760
♪ You

19:44.920 --> 19:48.670
♪ It's you and me

19:48.720 --> 19:52.790

20:10.720 --> 20:12.920
She's in your head all
the time, isn't she?

20:14.120 --> 20:15.790
Not all the time.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.720
Try to have fun. This is
your time too, remember?

22:05.040 --> 22:08.190
- Hey! Come on! - Aw! - You've
never kissed me like that!

22:08.240 --> 22:11.440
- Charlie, don't start!
- Sorry! - Making me jealous, boy!

22:29.120 --> 22:31.870
- Sam, hi.
- Hey.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.670
Are you working here?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
It appears so, yeah.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.110
Are you going to order a drink or...?

22:40.160 --> 22:41.750
Yeah, sorry. Erm...

22:41.800 --> 22:43.600
Can I get two mescals, please?

22:45.640 --> 22:48.550
- You got into character quickly.
- Sorry?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.190
Ordering banker drinks.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.950
Am I?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.630
Look like one, too.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.880
I'm so sorry to offend you with my dress.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.670
You're not like them.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.670
- Do you know them?
- I know you.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.950
No, you don't. You fucked
me once. It's not the same.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.720
- Talking like them as well now.
- Don't be a pussy.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.720
Problem?

23:16.160 --> 23:18.310
Trying to have a conversation, actually.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.870
Who with? I thought you were
getting me a glass of Prosecco.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.640
Cos it's... your job?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.470
To be fair, I should have seen it coming.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.070
I know you fucked me to get
one over on your best mate.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.310
Being a brutal bitch is clearly
something you already had down.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.920
Sorry, Georgia. You need some new friends.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.640
- George...
- You and him?

23:40.600 --> 23:42.750
You desperate bitch.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.230
- I'm so sorry, I don't know what...
- Cheer up, you two!

23:45.280 --> 23:47.310
Stop wetting yourself, I don't care.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.270
- It was a totally stupid thing to do.
- Yeah, it was.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.270
Skanky too, but whatever.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.520
It's not the time for this shite anyway.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.110
- I got it, by the way.
- Got what?

23:59.160 --> 24:00.750
I'm on the Steiner account.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.000
You?

24:03.760 --> 24:05.710
And Charlie boy.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.710
We're going to Vienna on Friday.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.230
- Amazing, right?
- Fuck it, let's just have a shot.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.380
Shut up, Charlie. You knew
that spot was meant for Lou.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.720
Lou...

24:24.880 --> 24:26.000
Guys!

24:27.720 --> 24:29.670
Speak for yourself!

24:29.720 --> 24:31.240
Come on, Holly.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.710
There's only four seats. Sorry.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.680
- I'll go on your lap. - You
can't, it's illegal. - Come on.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.950
You won't mind... You won't mind?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.400
Charlie, you look after your new sidekick.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.160
Maybe he wanted someone a bit more fun!

25:46.240 --> 25:47.680
Yes!

25:51.800 --> 25:53.270
Look at her fucking shapes.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.150
You were in the cupboard with Charlie.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.590
Yeah, whilst I was out there

25:56.640 --> 25:59.230
asking about his stupid
wife and kids and...

25:59.280 --> 26:01.030
McStay!

26:01.080 --> 26:02.680
Don't hover. Come in.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.790
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, you guys OK?

26:07.840 --> 26:09.590
We are all right. Aren't we, Lou?

26:09.640 --> 26:13.030
- Yeah. - I'm really sorry.
I know you wanted that job.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.070
It just doesn't make sense. I mean...

26:15.120 --> 26:16.990
I can't believe that
Charlie didn't tell me.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.070
She's totally unqualified,
I just don't get it.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.840
We don't really know her, Lou.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.270
Sorry. I know she's your best mate.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.590
I don't know what we are right now.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.470
She's different.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.350
I don't get why Jude picked her.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.110
Was Fay the first intern
to work on that account?

26:33.160 --> 26:35.550
She's the reason Solasta's
still got the account.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.390
Alistair couldn't get over it.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.940
They came for that big
bonus, do you remember?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.440
She was so happy.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.920
But that changed, right?

26:50.600 --> 26:52.470
Was it something to do with James?

26:52.520 --> 26:54.070
James? No.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.520
They were friends.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.070
I thought they were together.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.590
- I mean, they fucked a couple of
times, nothing major. - Are you sure?

27:01.640 --> 27:03.110
She was our friend, Holly.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.310
I know, but she obviously
wasn't telling you guys

27:05.360 --> 27:06.910
absolutely everything.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.110
- I'm going to go to bed.
- Yeah, I think we all should.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.790
- I'm sorry, I...
- Shh!

27:27.000 --> 27:28.800
Something's happening to you.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.040
(Let go.)

27:35.000 --> 27:36.640
I'm going to find out.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.830
- 'Fay. What are you doing here?
- I don't know.'

28:15.880 --> 28:19.150
- I told you to wait for me. What did he say?
- It doesn't matter any more.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.390
- Sorry, I was just...
- Who the fuck are you?

28:21.440 --> 28:23.390
It's OK, she's just a random.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.160
So, you can go back down.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.830
'The Solasta internship is an
assured first step in your careers,

29:19.880 --> 29:23.190
'and we make no bones about throwing
candidates in at the deep end.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.110
'We want Solasta interns
to excel in this business,

29:26.160 --> 29:28.760
'show their talents,
and express themselves.'

29:54.560 --> 29:56.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.000
- Who are these guys?
- Just a case study.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.040
I always knew you were keen.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.430
Do interns do Know Your Customer checks?

30:07.480 --> 30:10.030
Sometimes. With supervision.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.030
And those are to check that
your client's kosher, right?

30:13.080 --> 30:16.830
To check they're not dodgy or
funding terrorists or whatever?

30:16.880 --> 30:21.910
- Uh-huh. - So, technically...
you could fake that report?

30:21.960 --> 30:25.390
If a client was dodgy but you wanted
them to be your client anyway?

30:25.440 --> 30:27.150
I mean, it's technically possible...

30:27.200 --> 30:29.950
And that client, the dodgy one,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.630
they'd pay you, right?
For covering for them.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.680
- Who are we talking about here?
- No-one. Hypothetical.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.190
- I've heard of it.
- It's easy money, right?

30:40.240 --> 30:42.070
For the company.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.870
Before you've even signed your client,

30:43.920 --> 30:47.240
- you've collected a little bonus.
- Maybe. But that would be fraud.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.830
I don't know anyone who'd take that risk.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.270
Who'd be willing to put
themselves on the line like that.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.840
Even if it came from above?

31:01.960 --> 31:04.160
You've got a weird imagination, McStay.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.560
- Just curious.
- Just be careful.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.670
It's a weird thing to say out loud.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.000
Sorry.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.800
I'll see you at home.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.510
Jude?

31:31.560 --> 31:33.550
- Oh, you're not dead, then?
- Sorry?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.390
You skipped my tutorial.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.590
The girls said there was some leeway
if you were doing an internship too.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.230
So, you were at Solasta?

31:40.280 --> 31:41.790
No.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.200
What's going on?

31:44.400 --> 31:45.880
I found something out.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.280
- Right.
- About Solasta and about Fay.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.270
OK.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.110
I think Fay was being made to do
something weird with accounts.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.790
Something that jeopardised her personally.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.390
Fay had a lot more going
on than just that job.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.590
Bigger things than being
made liable for fraud?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.830
You've just started working.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.910
It's finance, there might be
a few tricks here and there.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.520
- That's not what I mean.
- Then, what do you mean?

32:13.880 --> 32:16.200
- Get in the car. - Why? - Just get in!

32:28.920 --> 32:30.080
Jude?

32:33.640 --> 32:37.430
- Oh, hello. - Holly has something
she'd like to talk to you about.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.720
What?

32:42.360 --> 32:43.600
Sit down.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.990
Holly is convinced that
someone made Fay commit fraud.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.150
I'm sorry? You think she was doing what?

32:56.200 --> 32:58.900
I think she was collecting
money for doing it.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.190
From clients who had something to conceal.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.240
And I think she was doing it for you.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.230
- Alistair?
- What do you mean?

33:09.280 --> 33:12.110
I'm new to this world, Mr McDermid.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.390
But I watched someone who
was so determined to die

33:14.440 --> 33:17.390
that she tried to kill
herself twice in one night.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.550
Now, we can all bang on, like the press,

33:19.600 --> 33:23.390
about how Fay was overworked and stressed,

33:23.440 --> 33:25.630
but we both know Fay was scared.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.630
The stakes were a lot higher than that.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.510
Thank you, Holly. I think
you may have said enough.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.840
Did you know Fay?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.600
Before, I mean.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.480
No.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.790
The things that have been said about
her, they're not funeral platitudes.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.640
She really was extraordinary.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.460
You're right... about the accounts.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.390
She was forging all new customer
reports in return for money.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.390
- What? - But you're
wrong about the origin.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.910
She was committing fraud on your watch.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.310
Making thousands.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.000
Yes, but for herself, Holly.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.199
Not for me. She'd signed
the reports off in my name.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.590
- When did you find out?
- Just after she died.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.190
- I told the police.
- Why didn't you tell me?

34:19.239 --> 34:21.550
She made a crazy choice, Jude.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.900
But we both know Fay was a talented girl.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.989
Maybe I gave her too much authority.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.989
- And James Buxton?
- He was doing it with her.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.949
He may have even been the one to start it.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.900
- I think that's why he's gone off-grid.
- Jesus Christ.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.880
I don't want this coming out.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.590
I don't want people who don't get it,
to feel confused about who she was.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.750
Understand?

34:44.800 --> 34:46.710
I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.830
No, it's all right. You're doing
exactly what we ask you girls to do.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.440
Think for yourself, look into things.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.429
I was just worried about Georgia.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.790
You don't need to be worried
about Georgia, you know.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.800
She's doing incredibly well.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.960
Be pleased for her, OK?

35:10.960 --> 35:13.470
Holly, I think maybe Jude and
I need some time to talk.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.680
- Yeah, of course.
- I appreciate it, Holly. Your discretion.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.480
Start talking.

35:43.320 --> 35:46.520
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same question.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.990
Trying to catch up, been a bit
distracted the past few days.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.110
You're worried about James?

35:53.160 --> 35:56.110
Maybe he'll feel better
with a bit of time off.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.470
I just wish he'd pick up his phone.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.160
Trust me, I know the feeling.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.590
Ah! Fuck this.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.720
It's Friday.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.390
Are you here to get ahead
of the curve or something?

36:09.440 --> 36:11.510
Just needed to sort something out.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.480
- It's done now.
- What something?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.280
Doesn't matter. Sorted.

36:17.360 --> 36:20.760
- Vague, much? - I had a question,
it was answered, that's it.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.480
Mystery woman. That's fine.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.120
It's kind of hot, actually.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.800
Oh, I'm sorry!

36:54.040 --> 36:55.710
It's OK.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.080
- Is Georgia in?
- She's in her room, I think.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.310
I just need to...

37:01.360 --> 37:03.590
I'll be right back.
Have a drink with Rachel?

37:03.640 --> 37:04.880
Sure.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.550
You're seriously going to
make him wait in the kitchen?

37:12.600 --> 37:13.950
- Not for long.
- Good.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.200
I never knew someone who needs
to get laid more than you.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.480
I like it when you're happy.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.350
I'm kind of busy.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.800
- I can see that.
- My flight leaves at nine.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.800
I just wanted to come and tell you
that I'm going to leave you alone.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.720
Right.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.280
And...

37:45.240 --> 37:47.390
.. I'm sorry for chasing you about.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.840
I'm still here.

41:00.240 --> 41:04.760
'One male, mid-to-late 20s. ID
reads as a Mr James Buxton.'
