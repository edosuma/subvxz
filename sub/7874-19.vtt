00:46.090 --> 00:49.927
Morning, neighbor.
Reading the newspaper, huh, Mr. S?

00:50.678 --> 00:53.348
Not me. Can't do it anymore.

00:53.515 --> 00:56.810
Too depressing. Bums my apex, man.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.607
I don't care if your
deadbeat boyfriend lives in his van...

01:01.773 --> 01:03.692
...but not in front of my house.

01:03.859 --> 01:08.156
- Too bad. He's on public property.
- He lives in his van? How bohemian.

01:08.323 --> 01:12.035
You know, I'm a little boho myself.
I once pierced my glocknick.

01:12.201 --> 01:15.496
Unfortunately, it was my left glocknick.
Didn't know the code.

01:15.663 --> 01:18.500
Can't tell how many people
tried to pee on me that summer.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.003
I want that van gone
by the time I get home.

01:21.170 --> 01:24.173
Well, the law says he can park out there
as long as he wants.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.175
The law is on his side.

01:26.342 --> 01:30.846
If I wanna get rid of Jeff, I'll have to
do something cunning and subtle.

01:36.227 --> 01:38.730
What a freak accident!

01:38.897 --> 01:40.357
Thanks. What do I owe you?

01:40.523 --> 01:43.193
Just tell your friends.
My business is word of mouth.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.780
But don't you have to
start charging eventually?

01:45.946 --> 01:47.698
Eventually.

01:55.498 --> 01:58.335
- What the hell are you doing?
- You shave your chest?

01:58.502 --> 02:00.837
What? No, it's for work.
Get out of my shower!

02:01.004 --> 02:04.132
- You crushed his van.
- Why can't Jeff live with his family?

02:04.299 --> 02:08.512
He hasn't spoken to his dad in years.
His mom ran away before he was born.

02:08.679 --> 02:11.391
How...? How could she do that?

02:11.557 --> 02:15.019
I heard you showering with Jeff.
I finally meet him. How do I look?

02:15.186 --> 02:18.564
- Like an alien. Put on a disguise.
- I'm not gonna wear a disguise.

02:18.731 --> 02:21.609
- But you love disguises.
- What? Where'd you get that idea?

02:21.776 --> 02:24.613
You can't go five minutes
without doing a fashion montage.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.282
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:27.449 --> 02:31.412
I hate disguises. And I'd rather stay
in the attic than wear your uniform.

02:31.578 --> 02:35.165
- Then stay in the attic.
- It's my body!

02:36.418 --> 02:39.546
If I can't get to know Jeff
face-to-face like a regular person...

02:39.712 --> 02:43.883
...I'll build a relationship with him
like fat people do: Through the Internet.

02:44.050 --> 02:47.720
Now I just have to find all the info
on Jeff I can.

02:47.887 --> 02:50.766
<i>Well, qu'est-ce que c'est que Ã§a?</i>

02:54.228 --> 02:56.397
<i>Muy buena comida, Mrs. S.</i>

02:56.564 --> 02:59.400
Did I ever tell you
about this choice burrito I had...

02:59.567 --> 03:02.654
...when I was backpacking that summer
I was super into rabbits?

03:02.821 --> 03:05.157
The dude who makes them
uses a syringe...

03:05.323 --> 03:09.119
...to inject a squirt of sour cream
into the centre of each bean.

03:09.286 --> 03:13.582
Ridiculous! You get pretty bad firehole,
but it's totally worth it.

03:13.748 --> 03:16.669
- That's it! Get out! Get out of my house!
- Stan.

03:16.836 --> 03:19.005
Look, Jeff is a part of my life, okay?

03:19.172 --> 03:23.426
In fact, we might get married one day,
so you might as well get used to him.

03:23.593 --> 03:28.891
Married? Oh, babe.
Mr. S, you are so set. Wait right here.

03:29.057 --> 03:31.059
Look, honey, I'll make you a deal.

03:31.226 --> 03:33.812
You don't marry Jeff
and I won't bake a roofie cake...

03:33.979 --> 03:36.064
...and tie your fallopians
in a square knot.

03:36.231 --> 03:39.359
Here, Mr. S. I wanted to give you
my wedding dowry in advance:

03:39.526 --> 03:43.156
Two ponchos and a flute
that summons a leprechaun.

03:43.323 --> 03:48.244
You can only use it three times,
so choose wisely.

03:48.411 --> 03:51.080
Where's my hacksaw?
I wanna kill Jeff with my hacksaw.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.834
Stan, there's an easier way
to get rid of Jeff.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.086
What? I thought you wanted
to be his friend.

03:56.253 --> 03:58.672
Yeah, I'm over that. Look at this.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.092
There's a bounty on his head
in Florida.

04:03.469 --> 04:06.263
He got caught with 300 pounds of pot,
but he skipped bail.

04:06.431 --> 04:10.310
This is perfect. If he goes to prison,
he'll be out of my life forever.

04:10.477 --> 04:13.104
Plus I can use the reward money
to buy some disguises.

04:13.271 --> 04:16.440
I don't know if you know this,
but I love disguises.

04:16.608 --> 04:19.236
There's no way you can transport
a criminal to Florida.

04:19.403 --> 04:22.823
Are you kidding? There's a rich tradition
of alien bounty hunters.

04:22.990 --> 04:24.951
I just have to decide on the right look.

04:25.117 --> 04:29.747
Which means it's time for another
Roger fashion montage.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.553
Stan! Damn you and your one outfit!

04:44.137 --> 04:46.891
Wow, I can't believe you're taking me
to a baseball game.

04:47.058 --> 04:49.560
I know.
I can't believe you believe that either.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.988
So you never told me. Who's playing
in this baseball game, Dad?

04:59.154 --> 05:01.991
I'm not your dad!
You have your own dad.

05:02.157 --> 05:05.160
Actually, we haven't talked
in a few years.

05:05.327 --> 05:07.121
I got involved in a little trouble...

05:07.287 --> 05:10.374
...and, well, if he found out,
it would really disappoint him.

05:10.541 --> 05:12.711
Are you and your dad close?

05:12.877 --> 05:16.548
<i>- Daddy, will you read to me?
- Who the hell are you?</i>

05:18.049 --> 05:20.051
Yeah, sure.

05:21.511 --> 05:23.096
What the...?

05:26.684 --> 05:28.728
You poached my bear!

05:30.604 --> 05:34.650
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm taking my bounty back.

05:34.817 --> 05:35.901
What's your problem?

05:36.068 --> 05:39.448
Oh, you mean besides being shot at
by a bottom-heavy freak?

05:39.614 --> 05:41.992
You know it's awkward
when I try to jog.

05:42.159 --> 05:45.495
Listen, I'll overlook the fact that
you didn't compliment my outfit...

05:45.662 --> 05:47.956
...if you let me take Jeff
and collect my money.

05:48.123 --> 05:49.541
I don't care about the money!

05:49.709 --> 05:52.295
I just wanna get Jeff to Florida
and out of my life.

05:52.462 --> 05:56.549
- You're turning me in?
- Look, kid...

05:56.841 --> 05:59.093
Damn it, Roger, he's getting away!

06:01.179 --> 06:04.266
- Why didn't you run for it?
- You wanna know why?

06:04.433 --> 06:06.935
Because I didn't think of it.

06:08.270 --> 06:11.648
O'Shamus McPherson,
present yourself.

06:12.941 --> 06:16.321
Where is my leprechaun?

06:19.282 --> 06:23.119
Great. Well, Roger,
I guess it's just you and me.

06:23.912 --> 06:26.998
- And now it's just me.
- Wait, how am I gonna get out of here?

06:27.165 --> 06:30.586
Try jogging, you gross bowling pin.

06:32.630 --> 06:34.965
- Yo, you flute me?
- What? No, no, that was Jeff.

06:35.132 --> 06:36.258
He hopped on the train.

06:36.425 --> 06:41.598
Oh, Jeff, huh? Well, you tell your boy
that still counts as one. He got two left.

06:43.850 --> 06:46.144
They love me.

06:48.355 --> 06:51.650
So I took the train to Raleigh,
and now I'm at my dad's farm.

06:51.816 --> 06:53.693
Just stay there.
I'm coming to get you.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.196
Mom, you won't believe this.

06:55.363 --> 06:58.908
Dad kidnapped Jeff, but he got away
and now he's hiding at his dad's farm.

06:59.075 --> 07:01.035
There's lots of places to hide
on a farm.

07:01.202 --> 07:06.249
Corn fields, a silo,
behind a cow, under a tractor-

07:06.415 --> 07:10.879
- Mom! We gotta save Jeff.
- Right. You tell Steve, I'll grab my keys.

07:13.882 --> 07:16.260
<i>- Yeah.
- Hello, Stan. I know where Jeff is.</i>

07:16.426 --> 07:18.971
But first I'm gonna need something
from you.

07:19.137 --> 07:21.766
Can we take one of those old
western photos together?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.188
I'll get it, Dad.

07:27.689 --> 07:28.940
Hi, Jeff.

07:30.108 --> 07:33.404
Expecting someone
a little less take-you-to-jail-y?

07:33.570 --> 07:34.947
Wait, you gotta believe me.

07:35.114 --> 07:38.075
I don't know how that pot
got in my van.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.620
You had a loose nail.
And I don't believe you.

07:41.787 --> 07:44.289
All right, I'll go with you.

07:44.748 --> 07:47.043
Just let me spend one last night
with my dad.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.795
- Forget it.
- I'm begging you.

07:48.962 --> 07:51.131
I won't get to see him for a long time.

07:51.297 --> 07:53.550
I wanna memorize every line
in his face...

07:53.717 --> 07:56.678
...so I can write a poem about it
for my prison poetry slam.

07:56.845 --> 07:58.848
Because that's what prison's
like, right?

08:01.475 --> 08:04.895
Hi. My name's Stan Smith.
I seem to have lost my credit card.

08:05.062 --> 08:08.232
Can you tell me the last place
I used it?

08:08.399 --> 08:11.527
No, I don't know
my social security number.

08:11.695 --> 08:14.322
No, I don't know my date of birth.

08:14.489 --> 08:17.034
My mother's maiden name?
Something Italian.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.913
I look Italian. Try "Frappuccino."
Hold on. I got a beep. Hello?

08:22.080 --> 08:25.793
Roger, it's me. Jeff and Stan are at
Jeff's father's house in North Carolina.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.795
Really?

08:27.962 --> 08:32.258
Yes. Now, in return for this information,
you must give me...

08:32.424 --> 08:33.467
...nothing.

08:33.634 --> 08:38.890
If you had just waited for me to finish,
you'd know I want nothing from you.

08:40.517 --> 08:43.145
Oh, hey. I thought you two
went to find Jeff.

08:43.312 --> 08:47.107
Mom can't find her car keys. What were
you doing the last time you had them?

08:47.274 --> 08:49.067
Driving. I think it was the car.

08:49.234 --> 08:52.030
Mom, if we don't find those keys,
we'll never rescue Jeff.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.657
Did somebody say "hot-wire"?

08:54.824 --> 08:56.826
- Can you really do that?
- Yes.

08:56.993 --> 09:01.164
And in answer to your next question,
I like a sneaker with a large tongue.

09:02.832 --> 09:05.586
So Dad, Stan's a friend of mine
from Langley Falls.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.254
I've got a good life up there.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.007
I'm in charge of tire inflation
at the bike shop.

09:10.174 --> 09:14.136
Tire inflation? That is so great.
Course, I'm not surprised.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.932
That's just the latest
in a long list of achievements.

09:17.098 --> 09:22.229
I'm so proud of my son. In fact, his is
the wall where I keep all his awards.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.689
What? There's nothing there.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.859
Oh, my God! They've been stolen!
I better call the sheriff.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.197
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
It's ringing.

09:31.364 --> 09:37.620
Hello, Sheriff Perkins? Henry Fischer.
Yes, father of the illustrious Jeff Fischer.

09:37.787 --> 09:40.915
Someone has stolen all his awards.
All of them.

09:41.082 --> 09:45.462
Must have been several strong men
with a huge truck. What?

09:45.629 --> 09:48.924
What do you mean, Jeff's never
won an award in his entire life?

09:49.091 --> 09:52.970
But if that were true, that would mean
my son is a worthless piece of crap...

09:53.136 --> 09:55.181
...who never accomplished anything.

09:55.348 --> 09:57.100
Well, sir, I'm not gonna sit here...

09:57.267 --> 10:01.187
...while you say those awful things
about my pride and joy.

10:01.354 --> 10:06.276
I promise you, son, I will not rest
until I get every single ribbon, trophy...

10:06.442 --> 10:10.072
...and letter of commendation
back on that wall.

10:12.366 --> 10:14.159
I'm gonna go round up a posse.

10:14.326 --> 10:16.704
We'll get Charlie's dogs.
Close off the perimeter.

10:16.870 --> 10:20.249
You just sit there
and keep on making me proud.

10:21.167 --> 10:22.877
- Isn't he great?
- Great?

10:23.044 --> 10:25.255
Jeff, your dad is a humungous jerk.

10:25.422 --> 10:28.508
No, he's just kidding around.
He loves me.

10:28.675 --> 10:30.885
That's why he can never know
what happened.

10:31.052 --> 10:34.265
Look, Jeff, no one wants to admit
their dad is a bad guy, but...

10:34.432 --> 10:35.933
Bad guy? Look who's talking.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.978
You're the one who tricked me
and pretended to be my friend.

10:39.145 --> 10:40.938
Dad would never do anything
that mean.

10:41.105 --> 10:43.816
I need something for dogs
so they can pick up the scent.

10:43.983 --> 10:48.405
Do you have your high school diploma?
No? They got that too?

10:48.572 --> 10:51.950
Those monsters are gonna pay.

10:53.618 --> 10:55.078
You can sleep out in the barn.

10:55.245 --> 10:58.206
Mr. Fischer, don't you think
you're a little hard on Jeff?

10:58.373 --> 11:01.586
I like soul-crushing sarcasm
as much as the next guy...

11:01.753 --> 11:05.173
...and kudos on your commitment
to the bit, but Jeff is your son.

11:05.339 --> 11:06.924
And my bounty.

11:08.384 --> 11:12.681
- Who the hell is this?
- Horse Renoir, bounty hunter.

11:12.848 --> 11:13.891
Born in the bayou.

11:14.058 --> 11:17.603
Some say the hell spawn of a prostitute
and a whore. Others say...

11:17.770 --> 11:19.813
- Shut up!
- Rude.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.149
Your son's wanted in Florida
for a drug bust.

11:22.316 --> 11:24.777
And I'm gonna collect the bounty.
Tie him up.

11:24.943 --> 11:27.530
I got arthritis.
I can't even tie my damn boots.

11:27.697 --> 11:30.033
My mom had that real bad too.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.328
The whore, not the prostitute.
Here, I'll do it.

11:34.370 --> 11:36.206
You don't have arthritis.

11:36.372 --> 11:39.001
- Rude. Liar.
- Tie him up.

11:39.168 --> 11:42.630
You're gonna help Jeff escape?
So you're a good father after all.

11:42.797 --> 11:45.091
Hell, no.
I just wanna collect that bounty.

11:45.257 --> 11:48.260
It'll cover my losses for when he
got busted with my marijuana.

11:48.427 --> 11:50.513
Wait. Your marijuana?

11:50.679 --> 11:55.268
- What do you think I grow here?
- The kind.

11:55.435 --> 11:58.855
All that damn fool had to do
was drive the van to Florida.

11:59.022 --> 12:02.359
There wasn't even any pressure.
He didn't know I stuffed it with pot.

12:02.526 --> 12:04.862
You let your own son
take the fall?

12:05.029 --> 12:09.200
You know what Horse Renoir thinks?
Horse Renoir thinks...

12:12.370 --> 12:15.832
What have I done?
Jeff was telling the truth. He's innocent.

12:15.998 --> 12:19.044
Now his own dad is gonna
screw him over and take him to jail.

12:19.211 --> 12:22.464
I have to pee now.
Whenever I get tied up, I have to pee.

12:22.631 --> 12:24.466
I'll try and hold it, but...

12:24.633 --> 12:28.136
I'm going now. I'm sorry.

12:28.303 --> 12:30.431
I'm sorry.

12:31.599 --> 12:32.725
I'm sorry.

12:37.522 --> 12:40.608
Jeff's dad probably has him
halfway to Florida by now.

12:40.775 --> 12:44.446
I got an idea. I saw this in a movie once.
Hop with me.

12:46.657 --> 12:48.325
That's good.

12:49.076 --> 12:50.119
Why did you do that?

12:50.286 --> 12:53.539
Well, you weren't gonna do anything
from a movie.

12:58.003 --> 13:00.630
Come on, Steve. You're our only hope
to save Jeff.

13:00.797 --> 13:04.634
No problem. I'll just touch the battery.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.015
Steve, nothing happened.

13:16.439 --> 13:18.441
I feel funny.

13:18.608 --> 13:22.738
Must be the smoke inhalation.
It's killing my eyes.

13:24.906 --> 13:28.577
You know what I meant to ask you?
How did we get out of there?

13:28.744 --> 13:32.331
<i>I think we did some sweet maneuvers
from that movie Backdraft.</i>

13:32.497 --> 13:36.586
<i>- I never saw Backdraft.
- Me either.</i>

13:37.628 --> 13:40.298
We have to save Jeff.
There's not a moment to lose.

13:58.192 --> 14:00.862
Sorry. That's how I wake up.

14:02.739 --> 14:07.118
Florida? We're in Florida?
Man, I can't be in Florida!

14:07.285 --> 14:08.745
Relax, son. I know everything.

14:08.912 --> 14:11.498
We're gonna go down
and convince them you're innocent.

14:11.664 --> 14:15.461
- Really? But how?
- I'm your father. Trust me.

14:24.512 --> 14:26.348
Stan, do you feel lighter?

14:26.515 --> 14:30.977
I'm definitely getting lighter.
I think I'm becoming immune to gravity.

14:31.144 --> 14:34.397
Why is there a leopard
on the Cheetos bag?

14:35.357 --> 14:38.318
Wait. It's a cheetah.

14:38.985 --> 14:40.655
Cheetah.

14:40.822 --> 14:42.657
Cheetos.

14:42.824 --> 14:45.952
There is so much beauty in the world.

14:46.577 --> 14:51.082
- Why do my wrists hurt?
- Because you're lying on them.

14:51.249 --> 14:54.044
How can you hear what I'm thinking?

14:55.587 --> 14:57.673
Do you live here?
Because I could live here.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.716
This place is great.

14:59.883 --> 15:02.636
Hey, look. Someone picked out
all my favorite stuff.

15:02.803 --> 15:04.596
- That'll be...
- And this.

15:04.763 --> 15:09.269
- Cat food?
- Lf I hold this, I won't float away.

15:09.435 --> 15:11.312
That'll be $ 147.

15:11.479 --> 15:15.191
Where are we gonna get
that type of cash?

15:15.358 --> 15:16.526
We can turn in Jeff.

15:16.693 --> 15:20.197
- I thought Jeff was innocent.
- We gotta save Jeff.

15:22.241 --> 15:24.243
He's had quite a shock,
but he'll be fine.

15:24.410 --> 15:25.536
Oh, thank God.

15:25.703 --> 15:29.373
- Wait. I know where they are.
- Steve, what are you talking about?

15:29.540 --> 15:34.296
- Your keys. I see them.
- Honey, you're delirious.

15:34.462 --> 15:36.381
No, ma'am. Let the boy talk.

15:36.548 --> 15:38.383
That shock changed him.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.719
I sensed something
when I was working on him.

15:40.886 --> 15:43.890
Something strong enough
to punch a hole from the next world...

15:44.056 --> 15:45.349
...clear into this one.

15:45.516 --> 15:47.810
They're on a Gumby keychain.

15:47.977 --> 15:50.688
Well, yes, Steve.
You gave me that for my birthday.

15:50.855 --> 15:54.358
He's got the gift.
Lead us to the keys, boy.

15:54.525 --> 15:57.070
Lead us to the keys.

16:01.742 --> 16:05.537
Man, what's with all this traffic?
We're never gonna get Jeff in time.

16:05.704 --> 16:07.497
Is this right?

16:14.422 --> 16:17.592
Oh, it's a checkpoint.
These are a good thing.

16:17.759 --> 16:22.806
Keeps people from hurting each other.
It's all about kindness. And music.

16:39.115 --> 16:41.117
Wait a minute. Who is this?

16:41.284 --> 16:45.455
Night Ranger, man. Night Ranger.

16:45.622 --> 16:47.540
Night Ranger?

16:54.590 --> 16:56.634
Oh, my God. We're high!

16:56.801 --> 16:58.677
Of course. When the barn burned...

16:58.844 --> 17:01.640
...we became pawns
in marijuana's mellow chess game.

17:01.807 --> 17:05.227
- We gotta get out of here.
- I can't just abandon Jeff.

17:05.394 --> 17:07.813
Screw him. He's a loser.
You don't care about him.

17:07.979 --> 17:11.983
That's just it, Roger. I kind of do care.

17:12.150 --> 17:15.238
- That's just the weed talking.
- No. No.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.073
I cared before that.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.827
He's so upbeat and friendly,
even though he has a terrible father.

17:20.992 --> 17:22.829
You know, I had a crappy dad, too.

17:22.994 --> 17:27.667
I guess, in a way, Jeff and I are
kindred spirits.

17:31.004 --> 17:33.882
Did you see that? The Indian?

17:34.049 --> 17:35.759
Who, Kevin? Of course I saw him.

17:35.926 --> 17:38.303
We picked him up at the rest stop
an hour ago.

17:38.470 --> 17:40.265
Dropped my Rolos.

17:40.432 --> 17:42.851
Stan, think about this.
You're a federal agent.

17:43.017 --> 17:45.103
You get caught high,
you lose everything.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.856
Jeff's never had anyone
looking out for him...

17:48.022 --> 17:50.108
...and I'm not gonna let him down.

17:50.275 --> 17:52.569
Good evening, sir.
Have you been drinking?

17:52.735 --> 17:57.783
Evening. Evening. Making things even.

17:57.950 --> 18:00.494
- Please step out of the car, sir.
- He knows!

18:00.661 --> 18:02.705
Hang on.

18:07.502 --> 18:10.338
Find the keys, Steve.
Take us to the keys.

18:10.505 --> 18:13.842
Here. They're in here.

18:17.053 --> 18:19.223
Nope. Nothing here
but a busted water pipe...

18:19.390 --> 18:20.808
...and a bunch of wires.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.644
Steve, for the last time,
you're not psychic!

18:23.811 --> 18:27.106
You'll get a lot of that.
People are afraid of the gift.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.066
Afraid of what they don't understand.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.860
Please stop encouraging him!

18:31.027 --> 18:34.823
Wait. This can't be.
They have to be there.

18:35.866 --> 18:39.620
It's gone. The gift is gone.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.748
- Or was it a curse?
- You can't see no more keys?

18:42.915 --> 18:45.710
- No.
- Well, goodbye.

18:54.135 --> 18:56.429
Slow down, Stan. I can't keep up.

18:56.596 --> 19:00.434
- Then drop the damn cat food!
- Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

19:00.601 --> 19:05.481
I float away, and you get a bag of food
scientifically formulated for aging cats.

19:06.690 --> 19:10.403
Too late, Mr. Smith. My dad's in there
right now, clearing my name.

19:10.570 --> 19:14.699
No, he's not, Jeff.
He's turning you in to get the money.

19:14.866 --> 19:17.327
Freeze! Hands in the air!

19:19.913 --> 19:24.377
You're wrong about my dad.
He cares more about me than anything.

19:24.543 --> 19:26.504
There's your criminal.
Give me the money.

19:26.671 --> 19:28.464
That's all I care about: Money.

19:28.631 --> 19:34.512
- Not Jeff, money.
- See? Wait. Am I Jeff or money?

19:34.679 --> 19:36.890
Oh, man. I'm Jeff.

19:37.849 --> 19:39.393
- Dad!
- You're under arrest.

19:39.559 --> 19:42.104
Wait. This man-hippie is innocent.

19:42.270 --> 19:44.773
His father planted drugs on him
without him knowing.

19:44.940 --> 19:47.943
- He has no proof.
- I've got his confession on tape.

19:48.110 --> 19:50.822
- I was wearing a wire.
- Why were you wearing a wire?

19:50.988 --> 19:53.032
I always wear a wire.

19:53.199 --> 19:58.663
That's why you shave your chest.
Oh, Hayley must wear a muff wire.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.582
I shouldn't have confessed
to two people I was gonna kill.

20:01.749 --> 20:04.586
- You were gonna kill them?
- Yeah, but you can't prove it...

20:04.753 --> 20:07.506
...because you're not wearing a wire.
- I'm a cop.

20:10.634 --> 20:13.971
Look, Jeff, I know what it's like
to have a lousy dad...

20:14.138 --> 20:19.185
...but the fact is, none of us
get to choose our fathers.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.814
No, go on.
I have a lot of father issues too.

20:23.773 --> 20:25.608
None of us get to choose
our fathers...

20:25.775 --> 20:28.529
...but we do get to choose
our father figures.

20:28.696 --> 20:31.949
I chose my mother.
That set me back a bit.

20:32.116 --> 20:35.369
Then I realized I could be
my own father figure.

20:35.536 --> 20:38.497
Well, there is someone I kind of
look up to.

20:38.664 --> 20:41.543
Someone I've learned to
respect and admire.

20:41.710 --> 20:45.380
- I think he'd make a great father figure.
- Well, Jeff, I'm flattered...

20:45.547 --> 20:48.467
- My Uncle Frank.
- What? Oh, of course.

20:48.633 --> 20:51.845
- Oh, did you think I meant...
- No. No.

20:52.554 --> 20:54.307
This is awkward. I'm gonna go.

20:54.474 --> 20:57.935
No, don't go. Why would it be awkward?
It's not awkward.

20:59.020 --> 21:03.274
So we should get going.

21:03.441 --> 21:05.401
Wait. Are you too stoned to drive?

21:05.568 --> 21:09.656
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm pretty sure it's all out of my system.

21:13.035 --> 21:15.120
Dude.

21:51.117 --> 21:53.203
