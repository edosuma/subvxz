11:39.709 --> 11:41.000

about you bringing

11:41.083 --> 11:42.500
your women
into my home?

11:42.583 --> 11:45.083
-She's my lawyer.
-(scoffs) Your lawyer.

11:47.250 --> 11:50.375
Huh. I understand lawyers
can be disbarred for lying.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.750
Isn't that right?
So, tell me.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.333
Are you
fucking him?

11:54.417 --> 11:56.667
No. Are you?

11:56.750 --> 12:00.125

fuckwit son out of my house!

12:01.750 --> 12:02.959

12:04.959 --> 12:07.959
Dad. Did you see the two guys
in the Seville out there?

12:08.041 --> 12:09.417
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.542
-I saw them.
-Junior: Okay.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.375
They're mine.
It's all good. Good.

12:14.458 --> 12:15.834
Wh-What are you
doing here?

12:15.917 --> 12:17.875
I'm regrouping is what.

12:17.959 --> 12:20.542
I mean, you always say come
to you. First, come to you,

12:20.625 --> 12:22.417
so I'm here.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.709
-Somebody's following me.
-Who's following you?

12:24.792 --> 12:28.125
Well, Dad, if I knew,
I'd hit 'em, right?

12:28.208 --> 12:29.250
Hey, Jett.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.625
-Why don't I wait outside?
-No, stay.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.750
They got Wesley.

12:35.834 --> 12:36.834
-Taggart?
-Mm.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.291
That's why I got
the reinforcements.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.166
But, you know,
these guys come recommended.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.291
Hopper did time with one of
them in Jackson, right, Hop?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.417
-The spic?
-Who popped Wesley?

12:44.500 --> 12:47.834
-Some hitter, right
outside my house.
-When was this?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.125
Last night,
early this morning.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.000
I kept calling him
and kept hearing
the ringer on his phone,

12:52.083 --> 12:54.750
like he was somewhere
in the house, but, you know,
like real sublevel,

12:54.834 --> 12:56.542
like, underneath
human hearing.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.125
Driving me
fucking nuts.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.041
And finally, I go out
to the driveway,

13:00.125 --> 13:02.709
and he's sprawled there,
face gone.

13:02.792 --> 13:05.458
You know, and at first,
I think, shit, a raccoon

13:05.542 --> 13:07.750
or some wild animal ate
his fucking face off.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.291
He's lying there
with my dry cleaning,

13:09.375 --> 13:11.208
which is splattered
with blood. (laughs)

13:11.291 --> 13:14.125
Smelled like a goddamn sewer,
he shit himself so bad.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.834
And nobody
heard nothing--

13:16.917 --> 13:18.250
not a single
neighbor in this

13:18.333 --> 13:19.959
quiet residential
block came out.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.083
No neighborhood watch,
nothing.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.000
-Where is my lighter?
-Can't smoke in here.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.041

circumstance.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.583
-Vivian doesn't like it.
-(scoffs)

13:28.667 --> 13:31.417

who it was who did this?

13:31.959 --> 13:34.041

I mean,

13:34.125 --> 13:35.834

you'd tell me.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.792
Oh. This was
on my windshield.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.208
Letting me know
that he's watching me,
taunting me.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.250
-Wanting me to panic.
-Yeah, he's got you
panicked all right.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.083
But this is not what
a professional does.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.250

(sighs) I mean,

13:51.667 --> 13:53.750
it could be. It's...

13:53.834 --> 13:56.333
There's a lot of moving parts
right now. It's all unclear--

13:56.417 --> 13:57.667
Just think. Think.

these things happen,

13:59.333 --> 14:00.417

in your gut.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.542

14:02.625 --> 14:05.166

14:05.250 --> 14:07.000

if the moon would exist
if we weren't looking at it,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.542

fucking Einstein, Dad.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.625
This isn't like
a bribe, is it?

42:45.709 --> 42:47.333
-Who's bribing who?
-You know what I'm saying.

42:47.417 --> 42:49.291
People do that,
trade information.

42:49.375 --> 42:51.625
Is that what we're trading,
information?

42:53.208 --> 42:55.750
-Okay, let me ask you something.
-Fire away.

42:55.834 --> 42:57.458
Are we allowed to talk
about our work?

42:57.542 --> 42:59.583
Is it important
we talk at all?

43:00.291 --> 43:03.000
Sounds a little forward
when you put it like that.

43:03.083 --> 43:05.041
Yes, slippery slope.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.917
But if I was a guy--

43:07.000 --> 43:09.125
I probably
wouldn't be here.

43:09.208 --> 43:10.333
(chuckles)

43:10.792 --> 43:12.709
If a guy said,

43:12.792 --> 43:14.709
"why don't we quit talking
about it and get a room..."

43:14.792 --> 43:17.667
On a first date, could come
off a little insensitive.

43:17.750 --> 43:18.959
-Too fast.
-Too eager.

43:19.041 --> 43:22.250
-Too uncomplicated.
-You're not uncomplicated.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.000
I strike you as
a complicated girl?

43:24.083 --> 43:26.375
You strike me
as no girl I've ever met.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.625
Question.

43:32.709 --> 43:35.417
-You ask a lot of questions.
-Well, I don't know
a lot of things.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.125
Is this what you always
wanted to do when you grew up?

43:39.709 --> 43:41.125
-Yes.
-Come on.

43:41.208 --> 43:44.125
-Ever since I can remember.
-I find that hard to believe.

43:44.208 --> 43:45.834
Scout's honor.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.917
Other little
girls wanted to be

43:48.041 --> 43:51.583
princesses, get married,
become a vet, a teacher.

43:52.500 --> 43:54.875
My best friend
in fourth grade was convinced

43:54.959 --> 43:57.750
she could study to be
a mermaid when she grew up.

43:58.875 --> 44:00.041
Not me.

44:00.750 --> 44:03.750
I always dreamed of breaking
into places and stealing things.

44:03.834 --> 44:06.375
Getting a job was
never an option?

44:06.709 --> 44:08.458
You think I do
this as a hobby?

44:08.542 --> 44:10.875
Big blocks of cash
are hard to come by
in a credit economy.

44:10.959 --> 44:12.875
It's a full-time job
finding things to steal.

44:12.959 --> 44:14.041
Well, you know
what I mean.

44:14.125 --> 44:16.291
Puts food on your table.

44:17.667 --> 44:19.542
-Hmm.
-How about you?

44:20.291 --> 44:22.291
You like sending
people to jail?

44:22.834 --> 44:25.041
-It's what I do.
-Not what I asked.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.750
Well, doesn't bother me.

44:30.083 --> 44:31.500
If it did,
I'd do something else.

44:31.583 --> 44:33.000
You always wanted to be a cop?

44:33.583 --> 44:37.500
No, but I guess I always liked
solving stuff. I like puzzles.

44:37.583 --> 44:39.959
-Hmm.
-Mysteries.

44:40.542 --> 44:42.709
It's what I do all day long.

44:44.083 --> 44:46.792
Some more perplexing
than others.

44:48.333 --> 44:49.583
Last question.

44:50.709 --> 44:52.083
Is that loaded?

44:54.709 --> 44:56.375
Sure, why carry it otherwise?

44:56.458 --> 44:59.166
Not that. That.

45:00.875 --> 45:02.709
Might be between
your legs, but...

45:03.792 --> 45:05.458
it belongs to me.

45:07.166 --> 45:10.083
(phone buzzing)

45:10.166 --> 45:11.500
Hey.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.583
Well done.
Let's talk tomorrow.

45:15.333 --> 45:17.000
Where you headed?

45:18.041 --> 45:19.583
Sounds good.

45:19.667 --> 45:21.333
Can you put her on?

45:22.375 --> 45:23.750
Hi, monkey.

45:24.291 --> 45:25.959
How was your field trip?

45:26.959 --> 45:28.291
Mm-hmm.

45:29.041 --> 45:30.625
No kidding.

45:31.041 --> 45:33.250
You have a good eye for detail.

45:34.792 --> 45:37.166
(TV playing indistinctly)

45:37.917 --> 45:39.125
(turns off TV)

45:41.250 --> 45:44.625
I thought maybe...
you took off.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.000
Where's your wife?

45:55.500 --> 45:57.125
Threw me out.

46:00.166 --> 46:02.875
This before or after
Josie was murdered?

46:05.417 --> 46:07.000
(sighs) Today.

46:07.583 --> 46:10.875
(sighs) When I told her
she deserved way better than me.

46:14.083 --> 46:16.125
That's a cowardly thing to say.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.750
Makes it sound like it's her
fault she's not doing better.

46:19.834 --> 46:21.583
Dillon:
It doesn't matter
what it sounded like.

46:21.667 --> 46:23.834
I had to set her free.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.208
Set her free by
admitting to the affair

46:27.291 --> 46:29.417
after your girlfriend
is already dead.

46:30.417 --> 46:33.959
-The only reason to do that--
-Is if you're not coming back.
Well, I didn't think I was.

46:38.792 --> 46:41.000
-I can't understand that.
-Of course not.

46:41.083 --> 46:42.959
You always have to have a plan.

46:43.041 --> 46:45.291
A contingency,
ways in, ways out.

46:45.375 --> 46:46.750
Yes.

46:46.834 --> 46:49.375
Isn't the whole point
to control events?

46:49.458 --> 46:51.667
They're still gonna get
away from you if that's
what's gonna happen.

46:51.750 --> 46:53.709
Why make things worse?

46:53.792 --> 46:55.417
I'm dead, Jett.

46:56.375 --> 46:57.959
I'm not supposed to be here.

46:59.125 --> 47:00.458
This is...

47:00.542 --> 47:02.166
A dream?

47:04.208 --> 47:06.417
Yeah, it could be.

47:08.417 --> 47:10.291
My imagination is
less than stellar.

47:10.375 --> 47:12.625
Could be this is
all I came up with.

47:12.709 --> 47:15.208
But, hey, the company
couldn't be better.

47:20.208 --> 47:22.208
Let's talk
about you.

47:24.250 --> 47:26.333
What's your move?

47:29.667 --> 47:32.959
You got to tell Charlie
about Junior and Salas.

47:33.583 --> 47:35.333
Timing is a little off now.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.417
Well, it won't be that
hard to get him proof.

47:37.917 --> 47:39.792
I mean, I don't know that
I could get it, seeing as how

47:39.875 --> 47:41.583
I'll get arrested if
I step out that door,

47:41.667 --> 47:43.709
but we can figure
something out.

47:43.792 --> 47:45.667
I killed his son.

47:45.750 --> 47:47.000
Junior was
out of control.

47:47.083 --> 47:49.959
Deep down, Charlie knows
that, and he likes you.

47:50.041 --> 47:52.750
Charlie will never
forgive this.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.208
I wouldn't, would you?

48:01.083 --> 48:04.500
(phone buzzing)

48:05.000 --> 48:06.542
Who is it?

48:06.625 --> 48:09.375
(sighs) My second favorite
person in the world.

48:16.333 --> 48:19.250
-Yes.
-Evans (over phone):
We need to sit down and talk.

48:19.625 --> 48:22.834
I'm kind of busy right now.
I just got back into town,

48:22.917 --> 48:24.834
as you well know.

48:24.917 --> 48:27.625
I need a little downtime
in between these jobs.

48:27.709 --> 48:29.208
Things have changed.

48:29.291 --> 48:30.792
Remember how
I informed you that

48:30.875 --> 48:34.250
he expected two more jobs from
you before erasing your debt?

48:35.000 --> 48:36.250
I remember.

48:36.333 --> 48:38.917
Well, he's willing to cut
it down to one final job,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.125
provided you act quickly.

48:41.208 --> 48:42.750
What changed his mind?

48:42.834 --> 48:46.917
He needs you to take care
of a problem, make it
go away, ASAP.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.709
Charlie Baudelaire,
and then you're all done.

48:51.542 --> 48:55.542
I thought I made it very clear,
that is not what I do.

48:55.625 --> 48:57.959
If you're in the business
of killing people,

48:58.041 --> 49:00.583
you should go hire
professional killers.

49:00.667 --> 49:02.709
I explained that to my boss.

49:04.166 --> 49:07.542
Well, explain it to him
so he understands this time.

49:07.625 --> 49:10.834
-Maybe you should tell him.
-What was that?

49:10.917 --> 49:14.834
I said, maybe you should
inform him of this yourself.

49:14.917 --> 49:16.000
Let me put him on.

49:16.083 --> 49:19.667
-Bestic is here?
-Right beside me. Hold on.

49:22.792 --> 49:24.417
Everything okay?

49:25.375 --> 49:27.208
Bestic (over phone):
Daisy Kowalski.

49:27.291 --> 49:29.166
I understand you
just returned from

49:29.250 --> 49:31.417
being away from
your daughter.

49:32.291 --> 49:34.709
I just landed
in town myself.

49:34.792 --> 49:36.083
Business.

49:36.166 --> 49:39.458
Schedule's gone haywire
over a delicate matter.

49:40.500 --> 49:44.125
I have limited time, but I can
carve out a moment to sit down,

49:45.250 --> 49:47.083
face-to-face,

49:47.166 --> 49:51.500
so we can discuss
your apprehension
to this final task.

49:52.083 --> 49:54.792
You've performed
so well, Daisy.

49:55.583 --> 49:57.458
I think it would
be shameful

49:57.542 --> 50:00.291
to now disrespect
our agreement.

50:00.375 --> 50:03.417
And I think you have the wrong
person for this last job.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.667
Be that as it may...

50:06.750 --> 50:09.166
let's meet somewhere
very public,

50:09.250 --> 50:11.041

morning,

somewhere you
feel safe,

50:13.166 --> 50:15.083

really is not in control.

53:30.917 --> 53:31.709

53:32.333 --> 53:34.333
We have seen that Junior has

He is completely unpredictable.

I mean you always say,

53:41.208 --> 53:42.375
So, I'm here.

53:42.458 --> 53:44.333
By turning a blind eye
to his son,

53:44.625 --> 53:46.667
he has lost
basically everything he had.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.417
But this is not
what a professional does,

53:48.500 --> 53:50.250
This-- this feels personal.

53:50.333 --> 53:51.709
You know, there are
so many stories that are

53:51.792 --> 53:54.125

become the sins of the sons.

Detective Dylan.
