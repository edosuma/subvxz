00:13.778 --> 00:15.178
(Both spit)

00:16.948 --> 00:18.282
I like how things aren't
weird between us.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.583
Right? 'Cause if somebody
walked in here and saw us,

00:20.652 --> 00:23.654
they'd be, like, "Look at those
two totally normal roommates.

00:23.722 --> 00:25.724
I bet they never sucked face."
But we did. You sucked my face.

00:25.725 --> 00:26.724
I sucked your face.

00:26.725 --> 00:28.008
- You did.
- Who cares?

00:28.009 --> 00:29.960
- You totally sucked my face.
- Sorry that I touched your hand there.

00:30.028 --> 00:31.829
- It was accidental. Like, who acc...?
- Yeah. I mean, which is cool,

00:31.896 --> 00:33.231
'cause that's the thing. It's,
like, we're just roommates.

00:33.298 --> 00:34.665
Who cares?
We're just cool.

00:34.733 --> 00:36.000
- I totally agree. Yes.
- You know what I mean?

00:36.001 --> 00:38.034
Let's reward ourselves,
'cause we're doing so well.

00:38.102 --> 00:40.670
Table for two,
fanciest restaurant in town.

00:40.738 --> 00:43.206
Yeah, and then we
could have sex.

00:44.274 --> 00:45.208
(Laughs)
(Laughs)

00:45.276 --> 00:47.644
- Just joking, I was just jok-- I was just joking.
- Yeah, no, I know it was a joke.

00:48.211 --> 00:50.880
Spot. There's-There's
a parking spot.

00:53.550 --> 00:54.983
I just finished
rinsing out the Dumpster,

00:55.051 --> 00:57.919
and while I was buffing
the backside, I found this--

00:57.987 --> 00:59.588
4D.

00:59.656 --> 01:00.922
So, who gets the spot?

01:00.990 --> 01:02.090
- Me.  - You know what?
I never get anything.

01:02.159 --> 01:03.159
- I would like it.
- I need a win.

01:03.226 --> 01:06.559
(Overlapping chatter)

01:06.729 --> 01:09.062
Give me the spot,
or I'll kill you all!

01:18.139 --> 01:19.073
(Whistles)

01:19.141 --> 01:20.841
I park under an overpass.

01:20.909 --> 01:22.343
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

01:22.411 --> 01:23.977
We all have crappy parking.

01:24.045 --> 01:27.378
Guys, why don't we just
all share the spot?

01:27.682 --> 01:30.250
We'll each get it for a
day and a half every week,

01:30.318 --> 01:32.986
and then we split Sunday
into six-hour shifts.

01:33.054 --> 01:35.389
Does it say "Share stuff"
in the Constitution of America?

01:35.456 --> 01:37.491
No, it does not.
Nicholas, what does it say?

01:38.059 --> 01:39.492
Don't share stuff.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.561
No one deserves that spot more than I do.
(Phone chimes)

01:41.628 --> 01:44.961
You know? 'Cause Lord knows,
I've done my fair... share of...

01:45.699 --> 01:48.267
spotworthy things.

01:48.335 --> 01:49.768
(Whistles)
What are you doing?

01:49.836 --> 01:51.904
I'm sorry. Daisy travels so
much, and I work at night, so,

01:51.971 --> 01:55.304
you know, our sex
window is... like...

01:56.076 --> 01:59.011
I've lived in this loft as long,
if not longer, than anyone.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.479
I have the crummiest room,
I'm on 24-hour grout watch.

02:01.547 --> 02:04.516
(Mutters) I pay the lion's share
of the utilities, do I not?

02:04.584 --> 02:06.885
I refuse to pay for the wiffi.
It's WiFi.

02:06.953 --> 02:09.054
I didn't even have to tell
you guys about the spot.

02:09.122 --> 02:11.323
Why did I tell you guys
about the spot? Oh, damn it!

02:11.390 --> 02:12.790
I'm the dumbest boy in school!

02:12.858 --> 02:14.258
As the only woman in the loft...

02:14.326 --> 02:16.660
Don't play the lady card.

02:16.729 --> 02:17.695
- I will play the lady card.
- Race card.

02:17.763 --> 02:18.629
Lazy drunk card.

02:18.697 --> 02:21.565
Deserves-the-spot card.

02:21.633 --> 02:24.035
Do I not, every day,
have to deal with Outside Dave?

02:24.103 --> 02:27.205
Dave? I have to use
my car now, Dave.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.605
I work so hard, I
just want some sleep!

02:32.976 --> 02:35.045
Dave, I'm gonna
go get some coffee.

02:35.813 --> 02:37.914
Um, can I get you anything?

02:38.482 --> 02:41.017
2% latte.

02:41.085 --> 02:43.986
He throws dentures at me,
he doesn't like cookies.

02:44.054 --> 02:46.555
Because I believe so strongly
in women's equality,

02:46.623 --> 02:48.343
I refuse to give you
preferential treatment.

02:48.358 --> 02:49.658
Well, that's really cool,
Schmidt. I really...

02:49.726 --> 02:51.227
Wait a minute.

02:51.294 --> 02:51.827
(Phone chimes)
WINSTON: Oh.

02:51.895 --> 02:52.828
Sex window.

02:52.896 --> 02:53.563
(Sighs)

02:53.631 --> 02:55.998
Now, if you all will excuse me,

02:56.066 --> 02:59.399
I am about to go and park my car
on <i>her</i> parking spot.

02:59.736 --> 03:02.103
- Ew. Ew! Get out. - As if there was
anything more important than this.

03:02.171 --> 03:03.805
I still want the spot, though.
Obviously not getting the spot.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.373
And then there were three.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.880
That's right. Just
the way I want it.

03:20.755 --> 03:23.023
Come on! It's a good job, guys.

03:23.091 --> 03:25.893
Yes! How do you two care
about stuff so much?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.627
Well, you know what this means,
Jessica, don't you?

03:27.695 --> 03:29.696
Nicholas Miller
is now a swing vote.

03:29.764 --> 03:30.898
- What? No!
- He's right, 'cause we're

03:30.965 --> 03:32.331
both voting for ourselves,

03:32.399 --> 03:34.000
so that makes you the decider.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.347
You two are on your own.
I'm out.

03:35.368 --> 03:37.170
You can't escape destiny.

03:37.237 --> 03:39.571
She comes for us all,
that relentless bitch.

03:39.639 --> 03:42.875
That's right.
Destiny's a lady.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.244
Destiny might be a lady,
but victory has a penis.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.713
Direct quote-- Scott Caan.

03:49.182 --> 03:50.748
(Knocking)
Yup.

03:53.085 --> 03:54.953
Hey.

03:55.021 --> 03:56.587
I found one of
your hoodies,

03:57.155 --> 03:58.523
and I borrowed it.

03:58.590 --> 04:01.923
You want to know what I'm
wearing underneath this shirt?

04:02.394 --> 04:05.662
Yeah, sure.
An invisible shirt.

04:05.730 --> 04:06.730
I'm confused, Jess.

04:06.798 --> 04:09.466
These are so long. Oh.

04:10.534 --> 04:12.002
I wouldn't put that
in your mouth.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.804
- Do you chew on this?
- I do.

04:13.872 --> 04:15.206
Mmm. You do, huh?

04:15.773 --> 04:17.574
It's crunchy.

04:17.642 --> 04:19.909
- Oh.  - You get hit in the
head or something?

04:19.976 --> 04:22.645
- Hmm?   - Are you flirting
with me to get the spot?

04:22.713 --> 04:26.046
How dare you
accuse me of that.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.951
- The parking spot is yours.
- Really?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.419
- Yeah.  - Thanks, Nick.
That's so cool of you.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.656
Sometimes I can be
a gentleman, believe it or not.

04:33.724 --> 04:35.191
- Cool.
- Cool. All right.

04:35.259 --> 04:36.591
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:36.659 --> 04:38.360
Get in here.
Yeah, we can...

04:38.427 --> 04:40.495
Let's hug this out.
(Screaming)

04:40.563 --> 04:42.030
Purple nurple!

04:42.098 --> 04:43.765
Thank you.
(Gasps)

04:43.833 --> 04:45.767
I don't know why I did
that. I'll get ice.

04:45.835 --> 04:47.202
Why did you do that?

04:49.472 --> 04:51.106
Oh, finally.
What took you so long?

04:51.174 --> 04:52.840
I said 2:45, not 3:08.

04:52.908 --> 04:54.375
I couldn't follow
your directions.

04:54.442 --> 04:56.077
I'm telling you, girl,
this complex is like a maze.

04:56.144 --> 04:58.479
Every building in this place
looks exactly the same.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.047
And for future reference,

05:00.115 --> 05:01.849
I'm more of a left-right
kind of guy, not so much

05:01.917 --> 05:03.650
- a north-south kind of guy.
- Put on a condom.

05:03.718 --> 05:07.051
Hmm... I don't, uh...

05:07.589 --> 05:08.521
You forgot a condom?

05:08.589 --> 05:09.890
- You got a grocery bag?
- No.

05:09.957 --> 05:10.857
- Tin foil?
- No.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.025
- Hand sanitizer?
- No.

05:12.093 --> 05:13.459
You got a shower cap
and a twist tie?

05:13.527 --> 05:15.795
You didn't bring the one
thing we need to have sex?

05:15.863 --> 05:17.630
- What about a baseball cap that's really small?
- Are you serious?

05:17.698 --> 05:18.831
Um, I got quick reflexes.

05:21.168 --> 05:23.336
Mm, I'm gonna
take care of this, okay?

05:23.404 --> 05:26.005
Okay, well, look,
do not waste my time.

05:26.072 --> 05:27.606
I will be back faster
than you can say,

05:27.673 --> 05:30.342
"Damn, Winston, I took care
of myself already."

05:30.410 --> 05:31.810
Don't-don't say that, though.

05:31.878 --> 05:34.947
Do not... Wait for me. Wait...

05:35.015 --> 05:36.081
(Door closes)

05:36.149 --> 05:38.250
Who wants an ice-cold Heisler,

05:38.318 --> 05:41.019
all dressed up in a frosty mug?

05:41.086 --> 05:43.487
- Sure. I like beer.
- I know you haven't officially decided

05:43.555 --> 05:46.888
on the spot yet, but I just
wanted to say, thanks, man.

05:47.492 --> 05:49.060
What for, Schmidt?

05:49.528 --> 05:50.995
We both know that you're gonna
give the spot to me,

05:51.063 --> 05:52.730
but I love that
you're keeping up the charade.

05:52.798 --> 05:53.798
Spot's going to Jess.

05:53.865 --> 05:55.333
- Jess?
- Jess.

05:55.401 --> 05:56.733
- Give me the beer back.
- I'm trying to be a gentleman.

05:56.801 --> 05:58.468
Hey, Schmidt. Hey, Nick.

05:58.536 --> 06:01.004
Oh.

06:01.072 --> 06:02.940
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

06:03.007 --> 06:05.208
Good.

06:13.516 --> 06:15.651
- What the hell?
- Hmm?

06:15.718 --> 06:17.286
What... the <i>hell?</i>

06:17.354 --> 06:18.587
I'm checking
my e-mails.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.522
Oh. Okay.

06:22.025 --> 06:25.358
Think that I'm blind?
Think I can't smell it?

06:25.528 --> 06:27.529
You think I can't <i>hear</i> it?

06:28.097 --> 06:31.630
The stench of filth and lust
is all over this room.

06:32.734 --> 06:35.036
Smells like freaking Tijuana.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.206
What... happened here?

06:38.274 --> 06:39.607
- Nothing.
- Hardly anything.

06:39.675 --> 06:41.009
Hardly anything?!

06:41.077 --> 06:41.909
NICK:
You know I'm not good

06:41.978 --> 06:42.944
at this, Jess.

06:43.012 --> 06:45.912
Shut up. Okay, fine.

06:45.981 --> 06:47.514
We kissed. Eh.
(Scoffs)

06:47.582 --> 06:50.550
It was nothing.
So? Uh, moving on.

06:53.821 --> 06:55.389
Don't be weird
about this, Schmidt.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.991
Remember... I mean, it was
like a dare, basically.

06:57.058 --> 06:58.325
Yeah.

06:58.393 --> 07:00.760
Mazel... tov

07:00.828 --> 07:03.630
to the both of you.

07:03.698 --> 07:05.431
Well, I don't know
what "Mazel tov" means,

07:05.500 --> 07:07.100
but it doesn't sound good.

07:11.504 --> 07:13.024
Excuse me, excuse me,
sorry about that.

07:13.072 --> 07:14.339
Emergency. Emergency.
Sorry about that.

07:14.407 --> 07:15.874
I need a condom.

07:15.942 --> 07:18.510
(Sighs)
That'll be $8.75.

07:18.577 --> 07:20.478
All right.

07:20.546 --> 07:23.080
What the hell?
What the...?

07:23.148 --> 07:25.249
Damn it, took
Daisy's pants.

07:25.317 --> 07:26.851
Look, I don't have
any money right now,

07:26.919 --> 07:28.520
but, you know,
I have somebody waiting for me,

07:28.587 --> 07:30.154
so if you could just, you know?

07:30.722 --> 07:32.856
- Next.
- Wait. No. No, no, no, no.

07:32.925 --> 07:34.706
Uh, look, what about that box
of condoms right there, man?

07:34.760 --> 07:36.593
They're practically open, right?

07:36.661 --> 07:38.529
How about you just slide one out
and throw a brother a loosie?

07:38.596 --> 07:40.130
Next.

07:40.697 --> 07:42.632
MAN:
Come on.

07:42.699 --> 07:44.067
(Sighs)
Hey, everybody.

07:44.135 --> 07:45.402
What's up?

07:45.469 --> 07:46.670
My name is Winston Bishop,

07:46.738 --> 07:50.071
and I am in desperate need...
of a condom.

07:50.942 --> 07:52.508
CLERK: Okay, that's it.
WINSTON: Now hear me out.

07:52.576 --> 07:54.343
- Okay? Okay.
- Come on. Sorry, folks.

07:54.411 --> 07:55.277
NICK:
<i>Hey, Schmidt?</i>

07:58.014 --> 08:00.382
Hello, Schmidt?
You okay?

08:00.450 --> 08:01.884
- Who? Me?
- Yeah.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.619
Yeah, look,
guys, I'm fine.

08:03.687 --> 08:06.556
Look, I admit, at first
I was thrown, but I'm fine.

08:06.623 --> 08:08.223
Are you seriously doing this?!

08:08.291 --> 08:10.058
I can't believe this!
This is so dumb!

08:10.125 --> 08:12.026
I'm sorry.

08:12.094 --> 08:14.563
I'm just... I'm trying to
process this whole thing.

08:14.630 --> 08:17.165
Nick, you're my best friend,
and you should have told me.

08:17.232 --> 08:19.067
And Jess, what do you think?
Mono is just some sort of joke?

08:19.134 --> 08:20.602
Nothing has changed.

08:20.670 --> 08:23.171
Like same old, same old.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.639
Except for the
fact that, uh,

08:25.707 --> 08:28.208
pre-kiss Jess didn't have
a parking spot.

08:28.276 --> 08:31.345
Post-kiss Jess does.

08:31.412 --> 08:34.745
Sounds...
like... change.

08:35.149 --> 08:36.851
I won the spot
fair and square, Schmidt.

08:36.918 --> 08:38.818
Did you, though?
I wouldn't say fair and square.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.654
(Scoffs)
All right. Fine.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.190
I used my body. Is that
what you want to hear?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.893
I shook what the good
people of Oregon gave me,

08:46.961 --> 08:48.661
and I got a parking space.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.062
Let me tell you something,
Nicholas Miller.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.734
You know, had
Winston kissed me,

08:54.802 --> 08:56.268
you're the first person
I would have told!

08:56.336 --> 08:58.236
I know you would have told me
if Winston kissed you.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.906
But I guess your
loyalty lies elsewhere.

09:02.274 --> 09:04.510
I can't handle this!

09:04.577 --> 09:06.144
Fine. Schmidt,
congratulations.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.746
The spot is yours.

09:07.814 --> 09:08.847
Okay. Really.
It's him.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.316
What?! Nick Miller,
you weakling.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.118
I can't have people thinking
my decision wasn't above board.

09:14.185 --> 09:15.720
This city can't have
another scandal!

09:15.787 --> 09:17.154
- Wise choice. (Laughs)
- Thanks.

09:17.222 --> 09:18.389
He's been manipulating you
the whole time.

09:18.456 --> 09:19.991
- Look at him.
- I don't think...

09:20.058 --> 09:23.093
Look at his smi--
he's smiling evilly.

09:23.161 --> 09:24.896
You know what, Jess? Stop.

09:24.963 --> 09:26.430
You're manipulating me,
he's manipulating me,

09:26.498 --> 09:28.265
and I'm getting confused.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.934
I am the decider of us three!

09:31.002 --> 09:33.302
I decide!

09:33.370 --> 09:34.738
Let the decider decide!

09:34.805 --> 09:36.372
I am not the suggester!

09:36.440 --> 09:38.608
I'm not having a good time
with this game.

09:40.077 --> 09:41.745
Give my regards
to Outside Dave.

09:41.812 --> 09:43.747
Stay away from my space...

09:43.814 --> 09:45.581
or you'll have this
to deal with.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.651
S...

09:48.718 --> 09:50.285
Where are your nipples, man?

09:52.923 --> 09:55.123
I'll never tell.

09:55.191 --> 09:56.592
(Laughing quietly)

09:58.660 --> 09:59.861
You're either gonna
break your finger,

09:59.929 --> 10:01.663
or you're gonna
break that button.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.665
I'm not going back in
there. It's too weird.

10:03.732 --> 10:05.633
(Sighs) You're the one
making it weird, Nick.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.501
You want weird?
I'll give you weird.

10:07.570 --> 10:09.336
Weird, weird, weird.

10:09.404 --> 10:12.273
Fine. Weirder,
weirder, weirder.

10:14.409 --> 10:17.742
Weird, weird, weird.

10:17.879 --> 10:19.880
Uh, weird, right, ugh.

10:19.948 --> 10:21.782
Weird.

10:21.849 --> 10:22.983
(Grunts) Weird.
Weird.

10:23.051 --> 10:24.217
- Weird, weirder, weird.
- Weird, weird.

10:24.285 --> 10:25.719
- Weird, weird.
- Weird.

10:25.787 --> 10:27.554
- Weird! Weird. Weird!
- What are we doing?!

10:27.622 --> 10:30.523
I don't know!
You started it!

10:30.592 --> 10:34.325
- Is this how it's gonna be? Is it?
- What are we talking about, Jess?

10:34.395 --> 10:37.029
You think things like this
aren't gonna come up all the time?

10:37.097 --> 10:39.131
We need a long-term solution.

10:39.699 --> 10:41.266
I'll give you
a long-term solution.

10:43.663 --> 10:45.571
I'm taking the spot!

10:45.639 --> 10:46.939
Oh, my God.

10:48.007 --> 10:49.373
What is all the commotion?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.042
- He's taking the spot!
- He can't do that!

10:51.110 --> 10:52.744
Kill him, kill him--
you said you'd kill him!

10:52.812 --> 10:54.973
- Now kill him! Now's your chance!
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

10:54.981 --> 10:56.681
NICK:
First car in the spot gets it.

10:57.249 --> 10:57.682
Aah!

10:57.750 --> 10:59.584
(Jess whimpering)

11:05.090 --> 11:06.256
Aw, damn it!

11:06.724 --> 11:08.158
You middled me again?!

11:08.226 --> 11:09.906
I'm not to be middled;
It's in my contract.

11:10.178 --> 11:11.912
Shoot!

11:11.980 --> 11:13.947
Excuse me.

11:14.015 --> 11:15.415
Aah!

11:15.483 --> 11:18.518
Hey, five bucks if you
help me fold this nicely.

11:18.586 --> 11:21.354
I'm not going above six,
so don't negotiate with me.

11:21.421 --> 11:23.222
(Tires screech)
Aah!

11:23.290 --> 11:24.991
Go, go, sorry, go.

11:25.058 --> 11:27.894
Oh, I'm sorry, I--
okay, sorry, go.

11:29.529 --> 11:31.764
Move it, you wacky bitch!

11:32.832 --> 11:35.301
It won't start.

11:35.369 --> 11:37.168
(Grunts)

11:37.236 --> 11:38.870
Help me push it!

11:38.938 --> 11:40.005
(Grunts)

11:40.072 --> 11:42.040
Get behind it.

11:42.108 --> 11:45.043
Back in the box!

11:46.879 --> 11:48.746
(Meowing)
Aw, cats.

11:48.814 --> 11:50.882
Hey, hey, buddy.

11:52.118 --> 11:53.650
(Tires screeching)

11:53.718 --> 11:55.953
What?

11:56.021 --> 11:57.487
(Laughs)

11:57.555 --> 11:58.789
Mine.

11:58.856 --> 12:00.524
The laws of parking
require a vehicle.

12:00.591 --> 12:01.691
This is my vehicle.

12:01.759 --> 12:02.859
This is my vehicle.

12:02.928 --> 12:04.728
Don't.

12:04.796 --> 12:06.230
Don't you do it, Schmidt.

12:06.298 --> 12:07.264
I'm not afraid.

12:07.332 --> 12:08.132
Schmidt, no.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.535
- You just hit me.
- Damn right I did.

12:12.602 --> 12:13.736
You're sitting right
in the middle

12:13.804 --> 12:15.704
- of the spot.
- You hit me with your car

12:15.772 --> 12:17.540
over a parking spot, Schmidt.

12:17.607 --> 12:18.707
Get out of the spot!

12:18.775 --> 12:20.076
(Tires screeching)
Jess.

12:20.144 --> 12:21.911
Move or I will hit you.
I want that spot.

12:21.979 --> 12:23.019
- No.
- Have you lost your mind?

12:23.047 --> 12:24.847
- Not a joke, move, move.
- No.

12:24.915 --> 12:25.914
- What are you doing, Jess?
- Move, move.

12:25.982 --> 12:27.582
Jess, stop it.

12:27.650 --> 12:29.351
What are you doing? Stop the
car, you lunatic. She's insane.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.119
- No-- oh!
- O-h!

12:31.854 --> 12:34.456
No, no!

12:34.523 --> 12:35.390
What is she doing?

12:35.458 --> 12:36.825
What is going on?

12:36.892 --> 12:38.412
Can't believe
I'm going down like this.

12:38.861 --> 12:39.821
You're not in the space!

12:42.530 --> 12:44.332
Okay, all right,
mine, mine, I'm not leaving.

12:44.399 --> 12:45.599
NICK:
I'm not leaving either.

12:45.667 --> 12:46.733
I have a purse
full of hard candy

12:46.801 --> 12:48.269
and an empty bladder.

12:48.337 --> 12:49.837
I'm here all night, folks.

12:49.904 --> 12:51.472
- I'm here all night.
- I'm here all night.

12:51.539 --> 12:53.219
- I'm here all night.
- I-- that's what I said.

12:55.938 --> 12:57.772
I'm really happy you
gave me another shot.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.774
Yeah, so am I.

12:59.842 --> 13:01.776
You know, you, you can't judge
someone based on their friends.

13:01.844 --> 13:03.844
No, and I feel like, if you
gave them another chance,

13:03.879 --> 13:05.112
you'd really like them.

13:05.180 --> 13:08.513
- They are down to earth and
chill, no drama.    - Yeah?

13:08.884 --> 13:10.251
(Pounding on door)
WINSTON: Hey, Cece,

13:10.318 --> 13:11.318
it's Winston!

13:11.736 --> 13:12.552
You got a rubber?!

13:12.653 --> 13:14.220
I need a rubber.

13:14.788 --> 13:15.989
(Pounding on door)

13:16.090 --> 13:18.657
He said "rhubarb," that's
how he pronounces "rhubarb"

13:18.759 --> 13:19.259
It's so weird.

13:19.326 --> 13:22.095
Nah, nah, I-I need a condom

13:22.162 --> 13:24.731
for my penis!

13:24.799 --> 13:26.165
What are you doing?

13:26.233 --> 13:27.867
Okay, we're not
close enough for this.

13:27.934 --> 13:30.002
Alright, we have spent
very little time together.

13:30.103 --> 13:32.104
You are the only person that
I know in this neighborhood.

13:32.205 --> 13:33.739
Don't you dare come in my house.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.508
Hey, man, hey.

13:35.575 --> 13:37.175
Hey. I'm Winston, good
to see you again.

13:37.243 --> 13:38.778
- Shivrang, Hi.
- You got a condom on you?

13:38.845 --> 13:41.480
Oh, no, no, look that's not,
We're, um....

13:41.515 --> 13:42.981
Her mother
and my mother...

13:43.082 --> 13:45.517
(Clears throat) I'm a chemical engineer.
- Winston,

13:45.551 --> 13:47.786
Look, Shivrang, man to man,
I know you have a condom

13:47.820 --> 13:50.655
in your wallet, but the question
to you is: Do you actually think

13:50.689 --> 13:52.791
you' gonna get lucky
with a a sexy lady like that?

13:52.858 --> 13:54.692
You know, I feel
like I'm getting lucky

13:54.794 --> 13:56.861
by just being here.

13:56.929 --> 13:59.897
Be honest with me. Ok,
fine, I've got a condom.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.732
- Aha!
- Winston.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.767
- Is he going to need that
condom tonight?  - Oh, God.

14:03.835 --> 14:05.636
- I'm gonna punch you in the face.
- Shall I give you a minute to think about it?

14:05.703 --> 14:07.137
- 'Cause I can wait.
- I'm gonna wring your damn neck.

14:07.204 --> 14:08.939
- This is awful, like, really...
- Okay, okay. Get out.

14:09.006 --> 14:10.273
- This is worse than last time.
- Honestly, physically removing you now.

14:10.341 --> 14:11.381
- I'm going.
- Out of my house.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.712
It's a sour ball,
not a bank safe.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.248
Just open the candy.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.817
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, I'm starving.

14:20.884 --> 14:21.918
Why don't you go
upstairs to the kitchen?

14:21.985 --> 14:23.252
It's full of food.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.401
Just give me
the damn candy.

14:24.455 --> 14:26.355
- Go get it.
- Wait, no, no, no.

14:27.591 --> 14:28.791
Aah.

14:28.859 --> 14:30.460
Okay, I have, like,
a stabbing pain, it's--

14:30.527 --> 14:31.888
and it's, and it's
like right here.

14:31.928 --> 14:33.261
It's my pishy.

14:33.329 --> 14:34.863
I, I have to pish.

14:35.431 --> 14:36.898
I think we should take a break.

14:36.966 --> 14:38.867
- Leave and you're out.
- Drown in your own urine.

14:38.935 --> 14:39.868
I got to find
a condom.

14:39.936 --> 14:41.369
I need a condom!

14:41.437 --> 14:42.671
But I still want the spot.

14:44.941 --> 14:46.641
Come on, come on, come on,
Nick, come on.

14:48.376 --> 14:50.310
(Stammers)

14:50.378 --> 14:52.379
Okay.

14:52.447 --> 14:54.281
Condom, condom, condom.

14:54.349 --> 14:56.249
Damn it.

14:56.317 --> 14:58.218
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:58.286 --> 15:01.619
Here we go... here we go.

15:01.723 --> 15:03.690
I mean, she's either having
crazy amounts of sex

15:03.757 --> 15:05.592
or she does not know how
to use these things.

15:05.659 --> 15:08.992
(Groans)

15:09.329 --> 15:12.298
Oh, just focus, man,
bring it in.

15:12.366 --> 15:13.800
Absorb it.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.636
(Sighs)

15:16.704 --> 15:18.170
Yeah.

15:18.238 --> 15:19.438
Did you just pee
inside your body?

15:19.506 --> 15:20.438
Yes.

15:20.507 --> 15:22.040
This is your fault, Nick.

15:22.108 --> 15:23.308
You compromised
the whole loft.

15:23.309 --> 15:24.543
We had an agreement.

15:24.611 --> 15:26.077
When Jessica Day signed
that lease,

15:26.145 --> 15:29.347
you, me, and Coach
all took a no-nail oath.

15:29.415 --> 15:30.782
No-nail oath?

15:30.850 --> 15:32.250
I didn't break the no-nail oath.

15:32.318 --> 15:34.386
Your mouth nailed her mouth.

15:34.453 --> 15:36.954
For the record,
no one nailed my mouth.

15:37.022 --> 15:38.222
That's important to me.

15:38.289 --> 15:41.058
Also, we didn't do
anything wrong.

15:41.126 --> 15:42.727
Do you know nothing about men?

15:42.794 --> 15:44.461
Yeah, I know
nothing about men.

15:44.530 --> 15:47.264
That's why I'm wearing
a short skirt and wool tights.

15:47.332 --> 15:48.933
A woman cannot be
in close quarters with three men

15:49.001 --> 15:50.167
and kiss one of them.

15:50.235 --> 15:51.201
What fuels men?

15:51.269 --> 15:53.703
Competition and sex.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.438
That's why the United Nations
was formed,

15:55.506 --> 15:57.407
that's why girls aren't allowed
on pirate ships,

15:57.474 --> 15:58.307
and that is
why there is

15:58.375 --> 16:00.777
a no-nail oath in apartment 4D,

16:00.845 --> 16:03.346
and deep down inside,
Nick knows that I'm right.

16:03.414 --> 16:04.414
Mm-hmm,

16:04.481 --> 16:05.448
back me up here, Nick.

16:05.516 --> 16:06.950
I just want a piece of candy.

16:07.018 --> 16:09.084
Are you serious?
You didn't give me the spot

16:09.152 --> 16:10.352
and now you won't
back me up?

16:10.420 --> 16:12.154
- You coward.
- Why should he?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.290
Because he--
because...

16:15.358 --> 16:17.092
Because, what, you kissed,

16:17.160 --> 16:20.362
and now he owes you some sort of
emotional support and loyalty?

16:20.930 --> 16:23.798
Reason number two
for the no-nail oath--

16:23.966 --> 16:25.867
bitches be crazy.
(Laughs)

16:25.935 --> 16:27.268
Isn't that right, Nick?

16:27.335 --> 16:30.204
I found garbage that
has chocolate on it.

16:31.873 --> 16:33.207
Daisy, I'm back.

16:35.711 --> 16:37.579
(Gasps)

16:40.514 --> 16:41.481
Daisy.

16:41.549 --> 16:43.283
Hey, Daisy,

16:43.350 --> 16:45.052
I'm here!
Where you at?!

16:45.119 --> 16:46.587
I don't have my phone,

16:46.654 --> 16:48.421
and all these buildings look
alike, and I...

16:48.489 --> 16:49.756
Hey, Daisy!

16:49.824 --> 16:50.824
- You know Daisy?
MAN: Shut up.

16:50.892 --> 16:51.792
No?
All right, okay, cool.

16:51.859 --> 16:52.826
Now, I walked around with "yum"

16:52.894 --> 16:54.061
on my butt all day.

16:54.128 --> 16:57.461
I deserve sex-- protected sex.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.298
Daisy...!

17:02.702 --> 17:04.971
Schmidt's right.

17:05.038 --> 17:06.571
I thought we could go back
to the way things were,

17:06.640 --> 17:07.573
but we can't.

17:08.641 --> 17:09.909
You nailed my mouth...

17:10.977 --> 17:14.310
and you nailed it good
and hard and strong.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.180
Now things have changed.

17:16.248 --> 17:18.116
Okay, but they don't have
to have changed.

17:18.183 --> 17:20.885
It's just different,
Nick, it is.

17:20.953 --> 17:24.122
That kiss was the dumbest
mistake I have ever made--

17:24.189 --> 17:26.290
dumber than Caroline,
dumber than law school,

17:26.358 --> 17:27.692
dumber than when I
thought it was pronounced

17:27.760 --> 17:29.893
"Brock Omabrama."

17:29.961 --> 17:30.995
- What?
- I thought

17:31.062 --> 17:32.597
his name was pronounced
"Brock Oma..."

17:32.664 --> 17:33.964
It's not...

17:34.032 --> 17:35.566
If I could go
back in time

17:35.634 --> 17:37.168
and take back the kiss, I would.

17:37.236 --> 17:39.870
I would take it back,
I regret it.

17:41.106 --> 17:43.141
Congratulations,

17:43.208 --> 17:46.541
you're the proud owner
of a new parking spot.

17:48.446 --> 17:50.247
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

17:51.314 --> 17:53.647
Jess, wait.

17:54.997 --> 17:56.319
You realize,
every second

17:56.387 --> 17:57.887
that you don't run after her,
you become more and more

17:57.955 --> 17:59.822
of a buttwad, don't you?

17:59.890 --> 18:01.123
Did you pee yourself?

18:01.491 --> 18:04.226
That I did, that I did.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.752
- Jess.
- Hi.

18:11.819 --> 18:13.186
Hey, look...

18:13.254 --> 18:14.694
Why you holding a
box of fish sticks?

18:14.756 --> 18:17.441
Because I'm going to go scare
the feral cats away

18:17.509 --> 18:19.676
that live in my current
parking spot, Nick.

18:19.744 --> 18:21.544
I'm going to throw
fish sticks at them

18:21.611 --> 18:24.647
while singing "Memory," and
don't you dare criticize me.

18:24.714 --> 18:26.149
I don't regret kissing you.

18:26.216 --> 18:27.183
(Sighs)

18:27.251 --> 18:30.619
I regret what it did, I regret
that it made things weird.

18:30.687 --> 18:33.047
We are roommates, you know, we
got to figure this out, Jess.

18:33.057 --> 18:34.090
A no-nail oath?

18:34.158 --> 18:35.398
You thought
I was going to sleep

18:35.459 --> 18:37.692
with one of you,
like I just couldn't help it?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.595
It was me, Jess, I
couldn't help it.

18:40.663 --> 18:41.829
(Box drops)

18:44.767 --> 18:46.068
You dropped your
fish sticks.

18:46.135 --> 18:47.936
Shut up, Nick.

18:50.139 --> 18:52.540
Ay, ay, ay.

18:52.607 --> 18:54.542
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.777
- We're having a conversation.
- Will you please get out of here?

18:56.844 --> 18:57.778
Yeah, well, that's the problem,
isn't it?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.613
Because I live here, too,

18:59.681 --> 19:01.915
and I'm gonna be here
when all of this goes to crap.

19:01.983 --> 19:03.317
Next time you guys have
your dirty little thoughts

19:03.385 --> 19:04.351
about each other,
you better be thinking

19:04.419 --> 19:05.486
about me, too,

19:05.554 --> 19:07.788
because I ain't going nowhere.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.188
You are literally sitting
in a puddle of your own pee.

19:11.459 --> 19:14.792
The apartment 4D no-nail oath
right here:

19:15.463 --> 19:17.497
"We, the undersigned,

19:17.565 --> 19:19.999
"Agree never to nail
our roommate Jessica Day

19:20.067 --> 19:22.302
"unless the sex can be
parlayed into a business

19:22.369 --> 19:23.803
that provides
for all parties involved."

19:23.870 --> 19:25.471
- What?
- I didn't read the fine print.

19:25.538 --> 19:29.871
"If one of the undersigned
nails said female,

19:29.942 --> 19:31.710
well, then all must nail her."

19:31.777 --> 19:32.917
- What?!  - I didn't know
there was fine print.

19:32.946 --> 19:34.913
- What, what?!
- I didn't know there was fine...

19:34.981 --> 19:36.881
JESS: Let me be very clear
here-- I am a strong,

19:36.949 --> 19:38.517
self-sufficient woman,

19:38.585 --> 19:41.219
and I will not be
nailing you, Schmidt,

19:41.286 --> 19:42.953
or Nick or Schmidt.

19:43.021 --> 19:44.522
Notice I said that twice

19:44.590 --> 19:46.524
because I don't feel
it's sinking in.

19:46.592 --> 19:48.392
There will
be no nails

19:48.460 --> 19:51.095
or screws or hammers

19:51.163 --> 19:55.696
in this building area
generally, the whole thing.

19:55.734 --> 19:57.400
What, do you think
that I want to do this?

19:57.468 --> 19:58.768
Believe me, pass.

19:58.836 --> 19:59.669
I just don't want
my home

19:59.737 --> 20:01.004
turning into a den

20:01.071 --> 20:03.139
of sexual tension and lies.

20:03.206 --> 20:05.574
Now, do you want things
to go back to normal or not?

20:05.643 --> 20:06.643
- Yes.
- Yes, I do, but I...

20:06.710 --> 20:09.012
Then, I just have
to kiss you.

20:09.079 --> 20:10.579
This is just one of those
things-- let's just do it...

20:10.648 --> 20:11.580
No, I-I...

20:11.649 --> 20:13.182
...get past it, we move on.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.316
I think that's a bad idea.

20:14.384 --> 20:15.484
Nick, you're into this, right?

20:15.552 --> 20:16.686
I don't know, might help.

20:16.754 --> 20:17.954
Are you serious?

20:18.022 --> 20:19.021
I don't know.

20:19.088 --> 20:20.288
Okay, fine, just get over here

20:20.356 --> 20:21.657
and do it and do it fast.

20:21.724 --> 20:23.358
- I'll be a hero.
- Bring it on.

20:23.425 --> 20:25.961
Mmm...

20:26.029 --> 20:27.062
Aah.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.031
- Ooh.
- No.

20:29.098 --> 20:31.133
- No.
- Mistake.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.734
- It was really a mistake.
- A big mi-- I made it weirder.

20:33.052 --> 20:36.320
Is everyone in the world
having sex but me?!

20:36.388 --> 20:37.922
Old people,
foreigners,

20:37.989 --> 20:38.956
nerds.

20:39.024 --> 20:40.557
Everyone's banging.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.159
Schmidt and Jess?!

20:42.227 --> 20:43.493
Everyone is
out there

20:43.561 --> 20:45.629
getting and giving
except for old Winnie.

20:45.696 --> 20:46.863
Look at me--

20:46.932 --> 20:50.234
a man who has
absolutely nothing.

20:50.302 --> 20:52.302
I left my phone,
my wallet,

20:52.369 --> 20:55.038
and my dignity
at Daisy's house.

20:55.105 --> 20:57.473
I even left my pants
there-- look at this.

20:57.541 --> 20:58.975
(All laughing)
Yum. Yum.

20:59.043 --> 21:02.376
I need a win, damn
it, I need a win.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.251
You need a win, pal.

21:09.319 --> 21:11.286
(Laughs)

21:11.354 --> 21:12.754
Yeah.

21:12.822 --> 21:14.722
It's a little
tight in here.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.191
Are you sure this
isn't too tight?

21:20.896 --> 21:23.597
Okay, um...

21:23.665 --> 21:25.799
(Car alarm blaring)
Uh-uh, this ain't gonna work.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.068
This ain't gonna work for me.

21:27.135 --> 21:28.035
Uh,

21:28.103 --> 21:30.004
I'm stuck.

21:30.005 --> 21:32.273
Guys, hey, guys.

21:32.341 --> 21:33.607
Hey, where y'all...?

21:33.675 --> 21:36.243
