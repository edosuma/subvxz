Housekeeping!

01:48.275 --> 01:50.694
- Arm yourselves, gentlemen.
- [key scanner beeps]

01:58.994 --> 02:01.788
Okay, this is the last time
I'm gonna say it, and then I'll drop it.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.082
But what about my jeans club idea?

02:04.166 --> 02:06.168
Right? Twenty dollars a month

02:06.627 --> 02:09.128
for access to over 10,000 pairs of jeans?

02:09.211 --> 02:10.255
Who wouldn't buy that?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.883
Well, almost everybody we asked about it.
Right?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.426
What about my hot-tutor idea?

02:15.469 --> 02:18.096
Kids would study harder
if their tutor was really hot, right?

02:18.180 --> 02:20.849
We just needed to build up
our... our stable of tutoresses.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.685
Yeah, well, maybe when you called them
a "stable of tutoresses"

02:23.769 --> 02:26.396
on the Craigslisting...
that was a bad idea.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.023
We could come up with other names.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.359
The whole point
is that it's a weird concept

02:30.442 --> 02:33.695
to hire women
to take off their clothes for children.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.824
Why am I coming up with the ideas, right?
I'm not the idea guy.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.118
Darren, that's you. You're the idea guy.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.787
I'm the "why." You're the "what."

02:41.870 --> 02:43.205
Baby Dunc, you're the "how."

02:43.288 --> 02:45.999
So let's put it
into high gear right now, baby.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.918
Why? Because our lives suck.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.046
I did my part.
What are we gonna do about it, Darren?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.714
And how are we gonna do it, Baby Dunc?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.383
Let's go! Let's freakin'...

02:54.466 --> 02:57.969
[imitates engine revving]
...put it into high gear.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.722
Yeah, let's kick it into high gear.
Sell me some salvia.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.641
- I'm about to get high.
- Darren.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.060
Darren, you're a drug addict.
And I'm here to help.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.938
- I got you. There you go.
- Thank you, baby.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.272
Enjoy that.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.996
- Ooh.
- What the hell are you doing, man?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.901
I'm a hustler. "I'm a... I'm a hustler."

03:12.984 --> 03:15.570
I'm basically the Rick Ross
of our friendship tripod.

03:15.654 --> 03:16.822
[Darren] What's the big deal?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.657
Weed does not do the trick anymore.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.575
- This stuff does.
- Really great.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.661
I'm not gonna become the mom
from Moonlight.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.038
[scoffs] Yeah, no.
I know what that movie's about.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.957
I steered clear of that one.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.876
I'm more of a La La Land guy.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.961
La-la boy.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.754
[lighter flicks]

03:34.131 --> 03:36.007
[exhaling] Bye-bye.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.885
[with alien voice] Latro.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.679
[laughing]

03:41.138 --> 03:42.931
- Gonna start tweakin'.
- Yeah.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.517
- [Alexxx] He's gonna start tweakin'!
- [Darren groans]

03:45.600 --> 03:48.770
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of this dude's load!

03:48.854 --> 03:50.105
- What?
- Look at this thing!

03:50.188 --> 03:52.208
- [Joel] Don't touch it.
- [Darren shouts comically]

03:52.232 --> 03:53.918
- That's a heavy hitter.
- [Darren babbling]

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
Whoa. Yeah, no.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.945
It's like Nickelodeon Gak.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.989
[speaking incoherently]

03:59.072 --> 04:01.366
- The consistency's thick, like flubber.
- Mm.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.702
Rub some on our shoes,
see if we can play basketball.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.872
- [Darren babbles]
- I mean, his nut sack must be gigantoid.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.749
- [laughing] Yeah.
- Right? Just big old sack

04:08.832 --> 04:10.752
- to produce that.
- I don't really wanna imagine

04:10.792 --> 04:12.085
any nut sacks,

04:12.169 --> 04:15.172
but I will say the only thing
that would make me blow a load that big

04:15.255 --> 04:18.341
is a really hot babe, right? I am right?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.386
- [clears throat] Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.388
I mean, look. They're everywhere, man.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.182
[Alexxx] There's one. There's one.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.985
This guy's busting loads
all over this room.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.310
That's what we should be doing.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.270
We should be busting loads into condoms

04:30.353 --> 04:32.355
or maybe even not into condoms
if she's tested.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.065
[gurgling]

04:34.149 --> 04:37.235
He's chuggin' champagne
like a freakin' boss!

04:37.319 --> 04:40.322
I'm over here... I'm holding on
to the poop side of this scrubber.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.199
Sure, yes. I've heard all of this before.

04:42.282 --> 04:46.369
We should be wearing diamonds,
collecting albino pythons, dating on Raya.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.788
Raya?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.206
We're not, okay? We're here.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.249
- This is our life.
- [Darren gurgling]

04:52.459 --> 04:54.920
That's still fizzy.
It's pretty good. You might want some.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.838
- What was that?
- [Alexxx] Oh, he's tweaking.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.841
Here, here. Grab a condom.
Put it on his face. I'll take a picture.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.719
- Oh, you are a dog.
- [barking]

05:02.803 --> 05:06.389
- [Alexxx] That's what he gets.
- [laughing] Oh, my God.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.350
Ooh, we got the snakeskin.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.560
- [Joel] Don't do drugs.
- No!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.229
- Okay.
- No!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.356
- Put it on his face.
- Take the photo.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.233
- Take the picture. Take a photo.
- No.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.193
I will as soon as you put it on his face.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.916
- I'm not going to. Just take the photo.
- Just put it on his face.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.907
- He'll get an STD.
- All the ejac is inside of the condom.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.492
- Take the photo.
- [shouting]

05:25.575 --> 05:26.701
- Grab it!
- [Darren shouts]

05:26.785 --> 05:28.065
[Joel] The outside, the woman...

05:28.119 --> 05:29.972
- she could have one, obviously.
- [woman gasps]

05:29.996 --> 05:31.790
- Well, she...
- Hey!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.459
[babbles incoherently]

05:34.543 --> 05:35.460
What's wrong with him?

05:35.544 --> 05:36.544
- Yep. Darren!
- No!

05:36.586 --> 05:38.129
- All right, just stop.
- Darren.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.881
[Alexxx] Okay. Joel, I got this. Come on.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.925
You want some salvia? Huh?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.802
[man] Get the fuck out of my room.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.178
[woman] Get out, maids.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.097
We're not maids. We're housekeepers.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.767
- Not even that hot.
- Yeah, dude, you're not even that hot.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.490
I was talking about the chick, Baby Dunc.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.229
[strained] Yeah, so was I.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.648
It's 2018. You can call chicks dudes now.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.024
- Okay.
- You can.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.985
[whispering]
What the heck are you guys doing?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.113
Hey, dude. See?

06:04.447 --> 06:05.490
[laughs softly]

06:05.574 --> 06:07.701
- [foot stomps]
- [whispering] Is he high again?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.953
No.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.872
I don't think he's being truthful.
I have to call Mitch.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.082
Wish you wouldn't.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.185
- [Joel] Don't do that!
- [Cassie] Hi, Mitch.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.128
- It's Cassie.
- Don't do that to your boy.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.299
Pick him up. Put him on the cart.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.176
Come on, Darren.
[struggling] Come on, come on.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.678

- Is that right?
- Yes.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.151
Yelling at guests, screaming obscenities.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.237
Well, Tums... boys will be boys.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.365
You still want that associate manager
promotion, don't you?

06:47.449 --> 06:50.327
Well, honey,
tonight is your chance to prove it.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.911
All right?

06:51.995 --> 06:54.122
Hope you got your balls on, now.

lady... lady parts

07:01.087 --> 07:02.714
that hang like balls.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.383
They're also called ovaries.
Those are inside.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.887
Good, 'cause we have got a shit storm
of a party heading our way tonight.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.472
Boys, I'm gonna need you working too.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.223
Toni... what? Are you serious?

07:12.307 --> 07:15.226
[whistles] Corky! This is Mr. Ahmad.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.939
He is the personal attaché
of the Bey of Tunisia.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.483
Oh, like the butler from Fresh Prince?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.442
Very neat.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.463
- I'm far from a butler. [laughs]
- [Joel] Wonder what happened to that guy.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.447
[Darren] Oh, that dude's paid.
He's doing fine.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.157
Bey Awadi. The rich dude from Instagram?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.533
This is who we speak of.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.035
Aw, I love that dude.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.120
He takes all the pictures
with the hot models

07:34.204 --> 07:35.664
and the guns and the hovercrafts,

07:35.747 --> 07:37.832
and the hot models shooting guns
on hovercrafts.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.335
Yeah, didn't he poop off the Eiffel Tower?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.538
- [Alexxx] Mm-mm, no.
- Yeah.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.965
He paid a man $10,000
to poop off the Eiffel Tower.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.841
[snickers] That's what's up.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.885
He pays dudes tons of money all the time

07:48.969 --> 07:50.887
- to do, like, stupid shit.
- Wow.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.263
- Dudes.
- What?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.807
We should pitch him the...

07:55.100 --> 07:58.019
We should... pitch in tonight.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.230
At the party. And be a team player.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.067
Also, I should mention, uh, no cameras.
That includes cell phones.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.071
- Privacy... a great concern of the Bey.
- All right, copy that. Give them up, boys.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.489
- What, now?
- [Mitch] Yeah.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.702
Hashtag "right now." What is it
with you kids and the phones? Come on.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.829
You'll get 'em back
at the end of the night.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.082
Okay. Now...

08:19.666 --> 08:22.293
you guys have some place to be?
I bet you do, huh?

08:23.670 --> 08:24.838
So fucking get there!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.174
Oh, hey!

08:28.258 --> 08:30.468
Sack up now, Tums. Big night, right?

08:30.552 --> 08:31.594
Yes!

08:32.136 --> 08:34.556
- I can't get in there.
- [laughs]

08:34.639 --> 08:37.433
I call her Tums
'cause she relieves my heartburn.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.394
[chuckles] Always been a nickname guy,

08:39.477 --> 08:42.813
even when I was back QB-ing at USC.
[bites into apple]

08:42.938 --> 08:44.774
Our security team should be arriving soon.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.858
Great.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.736
Hey, wanna go for one?

08:47.819 --> 08:48.820
- No.
- Blue.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.239
- Forty-two! Hut, hut, hut, huh?
- What are we doing?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.591
- Wanna go?
- I don't know what...

08:52.615 --> 08:54.034
All right. Fuck it.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.036
- [trash can clangs loudly]
- Oh!

08:56.119 --> 08:57.704
Right in the numbers! [laughs]

08:57.787 --> 08:58.705
I still got it.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.540
I'll race you down there. Come on!

09:03.418 --> 09:05.128
[bounce music playing]

09:06.796 --> 09:08.131
[woman moans]

09:08.214 --> 09:09.966
<i>Don't be stingy, papi.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:16.097
- Kisses. [smooching]
- [woman] You like that?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.141
[woman] It's for you.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.521
- Uh, I have to go.
<i>- Okay, bye. Bye, sexy.</i>

09:29.277 --> 09:31.905
[guard] Hey. I'm Ray.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.034
Mitch usually has me run security
for these special events.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.204
Uh, but you look like
you know what you're doing.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.749
[chuckling] I'm just here
for the payday, right?

09:42.832 --> 09:43.917
That makes two of us.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.585
Aah!

09:59.766 --> 10:02.060
Donald, get linked up
with our offshore bank accounts

10:02.143 --> 10:03.311
as soon as possible.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.729
Well, you didn't bring me along

10:04.813 --> 10:07.524
'cause I look like the black nerd
from Die Hard...

10:07.607 --> 10:08.608
'cause I don't.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.069
Roger, I'm sick of it.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
We need to secure the building
and arm the exits

10:13.822 --> 10:17.242
with our explosive triggers
before we can take control of the rooftop.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.454
So until then,
consider yourselves "hotel security."

10:22.163 --> 10:25.291
And once the Bey gives us
his account access codes

10:25.375 --> 10:27.293
and Donald transfers the money...

10:27.919 --> 10:29.254
we pull out.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.757
Gentlemen... let's move.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.136
Oh, and... someone get rid of the body.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.933
You should grab his ankles.
You're good at that.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.603
- Fuck off, fag.
- Ooh. [laughs]

10:52.694 --> 10:56.281
You'd seriously wanna pitch
the Bey of Tunisia

10:56.364 --> 10:57.644
one of our million-dollar ideas?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.659
- Yeah.
- If we're pitching an idea...

10:59.742 --> 11:02.120
- We're pitching!
- [Darren] What are we pitching?

11:02.203 --> 11:05.373
[exhales] We could go
with my jeans club idea.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.332
Hot tutors.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.419
Medieval Times:
breakfast, lunch, and tournament?

11:09.502 --> 11:12.755
I don't ever wanna hear
about Medieval Times BLT ever again.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.382
Okay, they only do dinner.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.968
We would do breakfast and lunch.
That's two more meals!

11:17.051 --> 11:20.054
We would totally knock 'em out
of the medieval dining space.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.264
Oh, that's a huge market.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.434
Okay, you guys have good ideas?
I wanna hear 'em. I'm excited to hear 'em.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.477
- [sighs]
- [Alexxx] I feel like I'm the only one

11:26.561 --> 11:28.229
crushing ideas out the gate.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.399
Skintendo Joysuit?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.985
Uh, what? No. Baby Dunc...

11:34.068 --> 11:36.279
Yeah, we're going Skintendo. I like it.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.032
All right, you know what?
I hate to be this guy,

11:39.157 --> 11:41.534
but that dude's not gonna invest
in Skintendo.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.202
Not in a million Willenniums.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.539
So, it's like that?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.501
We finally have a shot

11:50.585 --> 11:53.922
to fulfill our childhood dreams

11:54.005 --> 11:57.216
and you guys wanna let it float on past?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.970
[bellowing] It's... like... dat?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.850
- [Darren sighs]
- I don't know about you,

12:05.934 --> 12:07.936
but I don't wanna be picking up
nut-stuffed condoms

12:08.019 --> 12:11.022
for the rest of my life without knowing
what type of sex they had with it.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.024
Was it missionary? Was it doggy?

12:13.107 --> 12:15.610
Was it doggy butt? Was it side-style butt?
I don't know.

12:15.693 --> 12:20.573
Yeah, Alexxx, we all wanna know
how people are fucking each other, okay?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.075
- Obviously.
- It's obvious.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.558
- Mostly all I think about.
- Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.579
- Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl.
- Plow-girl.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.498
- Where you take the legs and you...
- Yeah.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.541
I'm just saying,
we don't have the Joysuit.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.044
Right? There's no screen
to play Lumber Jackson.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.170
- Right.
- Okay.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.006
You ready? Okay, you're the QB.
You're the running back.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.549
Giving you the ball. Run with it.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.386
You need to write down
all the technical mumbo jumbo

12:41.469 --> 12:43.471
so the Bey understands what this thing is.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.973
- Right?
- That's a lot of work.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.225
Darren, I'm gonna get you markers,
a poster board.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.060
You're gonna draw Lumber Jackson

12:49.143 --> 12:52.063
so beautifully... muscles just popping.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.649
Shredded, baby!

12:54.732 --> 12:57.902
And you're gonna draw the Skintendo.
Right? The whole Joysuit.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.697
Make it look pretty, and then I'm gonna
pitch that motherfucker.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.825
- Okay.
- Dollar-dollar bills, y'all.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.327
[imitates explosion] Boom! Put it in.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.912
Dew'd Crew in full effect!

13:07.996 --> 13:12.291
Finally fulfilling our destiny
of being childhood billionaires.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.501
Let's do it! Hands in.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.712
[whispering] Everybody put your hands in.
Hands in.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.880
Put your fist in. Put your fist in.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.716
Dew'd Crew!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.759
- I fucking love you guys. I'm so excited.
- Okay.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.012
- Yes! I'll go get supplies.
- All right.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.056
Yeah, just, uh, go get
those markers, man. Sick.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.349
What the fuck was that?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.642
What?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.561
I mean, c-come on.
He's gonna pitch something.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.937
It might as well be Skintendo.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.439
Listen, dum-dum.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.399
We can't pitch any of the upgrades.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.028
We can't pitch the wireless connectivity,
the friend-controller mode.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.072
Because if we do, Alexxx is gonna know

13:43.156 --> 13:45.366
that we've been
working on Skintendo without him.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.160
I'm just sick of working here, all right?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.995
We should've told him from the beginning.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.078
No, no. What?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.165
He would've turned it
into some moneymaking idea,

13:52.248 --> 13:54.208
and that's not what it is to us. Right?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.353
- [quietly] Right.
- And we're not gonna tell him now,

13:56.377 --> 13:58.129
'cause he'll probably just...

13:58.212 --> 14:00.214
kill himself. Or someone. I don't know.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.760
I can just see him going into a rage
and... biting people. Children.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.179
Bitten children. Blood on your hands.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.638
- [Darren sighs]
- [Joel] Fine.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.475
So we pitch Bey, he laughs us off,

14:10.558 --> 14:14.729
and we go back to working on the idea...
together, secretly.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.064
[exhales]

14:17.398 --> 14:18.524
The fuck is that?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.069
- It's a vape pen, Baby Dunc.
- Okay.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.363
Well, you look like a tool
smoking that thing.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.782
[mockingly] Well, I'm not "smoking" it.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.116
I'm vaping it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.659
[inhales]

14:30.620 --> 14:32.622
[suspenseful music playing]

14:32.705 --> 14:34.457
Ah, these your boys?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.710
I believe so. Mr. Drothers.

14:37.794 --> 14:41.464
- Mr. Ahmad. We, uh, spoke over the phone.
- Please. Conrad.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.551
- This is Donald. This is Erma.
- [Mitch] You brought your girlfriend, huh?

14:45.635 --> 14:47.053
I'm not his girlfriend.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.221
[whispering] Noted.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.308
So did you guys, uh, meet up with Ray?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.227
Ray isn't going to make it.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.480
But I assure you, he briefed me.
Thoroughly.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.818
Okay, Conrad.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.154
If Ray briefed you so thoroughly...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.866
...he left out the most important detail
of the evening.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.994
[music intensifying]

15:16.249 --> 15:17.291
No hats.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.838
No hats. I guess the Bey likes
to be the only guy wearing a hat.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.465
Which I get, you know,
'cause I'm a hat guy myself.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.593
But, uh... really, love the Kangol, but...

15:28.052 --> 15:29.595
Maybe call you Kangol-roo.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.719
[Conrad] Uh... [chuckling]

15:30.763 --> 15:33.057
- Kangol-roo, huh? How about that?
- [all chuckling]

15:33.141 --> 15:34.767
Come on. Let's go have a party, huh?

15:34.851 --> 15:35.977
Let's have some fun.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.980
I'm gonna dance with you tonight, my dear.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.691
[imitating dance beat]

15:42.233 --> 15:45.361
<i>♪ Have a word for your brother ♪</i>

15:45.445 --> 15:48.656
<i>♪ Have some time for one another ♪</i>

15:48.739 --> 15:51.826
<i>♪ Really love one another ♪</i>

15:51.909 --> 15:54.620
<i>♪ It's so hard to find ♪</i>

15:55.329 --> 15:57.957
<i>♪ Have a word for your brother... ♪</i>

15:58.040 --> 15:59.292
[laughs] Whoo!

15:59.375 --> 16:01.836
Catch me, dudes! [shouts and grunts]

16:01.919 --> 16:04.338
- [crowd gasps]
<i>- ♪ Really love one another... ♪</i>

16:04.422 --> 16:07.550
Yeah, so I met Bey...
uh, he was doing a TED Talk

16:07.633 --> 16:10.136
in Vegas... on being 'bout it.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.889
We had a moment,
and now we're good friends. [chuckles]

16:12.972 --> 16:16.976
Well, we're not good friends, actually.
I w... I would say... acquaintances.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.299
You know what? [stammers]
I'm hoping to meet him tonight.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.272
Keep your eyes peeled.
The Bey's somewhere here.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.733
[Darren] Whoa! Oh!
Action Bronson right over here.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.111
[clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Bronson.
Can I interest you in a pulled pork...

16:27.612 --> 16:28.988
barbecue quesadilla...

16:29.572 --> 16:31.115
with corn relish.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.538
Fuck, that's fuckin' delicious, man.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.457
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.335
- He spit it out but said it was delicious.
- Yes.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.421
Maybe he's watching his calorie intake.
He is wearing athletic wear.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.006
Ho-ly shit.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
There he is...

16:49.467 --> 16:50.467
the Bey.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.096
Oh, my God, he is the man.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.433
Even his little dog
has 100,000 followers.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.018
- Wow.
- Yeah, I don't know,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.686
it looks like he's having fun.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.855
We should probably
just let him do his thang.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.775
Maybe we, uh, hang in the cut?
You know, have him come to us?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.527
"The cut"? There's no cut.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.362
- Action's in the cut.
- [stammering]

17:09.444 --> 17:11.321
We're not gonna be in the cut if...
whatever.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.698
Let's go. It's game time.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.326
Hey, yo, I had this pet hyena once, right?

17:15.409 --> 17:16.743
Then that motherfucker died. Ehh!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.621
More appeteezees for the Bey.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.665
Then I had that motherfucker stuffed,
put a Fleshlight in back,

17:21.749 --> 17:23.709
and then I fucked the shit out that bitch.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.712
It's like necrophilia
and bestiality in one.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.506
- [Bey] It's hilarious!
- [laughter]

17:28.589 --> 17:30.883
[laughs] That is hilarious.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.718
Pulled pork quesadilla...

17:32.802 --> 17:35.763
- with a corn relish, anyone?
- Yo.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.266
That sounds bomb as fyuck right now.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.684
Throw one into my open mouth.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.827
- Really?
- [Bey] Yeah, bro.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.436
- Okay.
- Ah...

17:42.562 --> 17:43.771
[laughter]

17:43.854 --> 17:46.148
- Oh, I nailed it!
- [Bey] Make it rain!

17:46.232 --> 17:47.400
- Makin' it rain!
- Come on!

17:47.525 --> 17:48.859
[all shouting, laughing]

17:48.943 --> 17:51.904
Oh, that shit was dope.
I'm covered in grease, baby.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.864
- Yo, you're my dude.
- Thank you so much.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.783
And this shit is on punto.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.368
[laughs] Hey, um...

17:57.451 --> 17:58.911
Bey-Bey, may I ask you a question?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.372
- What that, bro?
- [shouting] Do you like black people?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.960
Because Lumber Jackson is the first

18:06.043 --> 18:09.005
full-body-controlled
blaxploitation video game ever.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.966
Now, using our revolutionary
Skintendo Joysuit technology...

18:12.049 --> 18:14.343
Excuse me. Step away immediately.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.304
Yo, Ahmad, chill the fuck out, bro.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.097
I'm trying to listen to the man.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.700
- Thank you.
- [Ahmad] I'm chilled out.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.934
I arranged this chilled-out party.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.477
I got Shaggy to perform. [laughs]

18:23.561 --> 18:24.478
[mockingly] Uh, Shaggy?

18:24.562 --> 18:27.273
Man, busted-ass Shaggy
ain't performing shit, a'ight?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.317
And put that dusty-ass BlackBerry away.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.777
This primitive-ass,
prehistoric motherfucker.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.739
I'm sorry, guys, 2018,
this dude ain't got a touch screen?

18:34.822 --> 18:35.906
You big fucking tree.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.658
[laughing] Goddamn.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.160
What a bitch-ass.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.370
- He's just a butler.
- [Alexxx] Yeah, you suck.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.331
Yeah, you got low self-esteem.
Fuck off, bro.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.625
Anyway, you were saying, my dude?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.918
That suit controls
that video game character?

18:48.002 --> 18:49.253
- Yes, actually.
- Oh, yeah.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.797
- And here...
- Yeah, this is the schematics right here.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.424
You know, I built it, programmed it.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.092
[Bey] Oh, my God.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.720
Bro, please approach us
and just unzip your trousers

18:57.803 --> 18:59.847
and pull that dick out
so we could just see

18:59.930 --> 19:02.850
what the penis head of a genius
really looks like.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.661
- Know what I'm saying?
- Pull your dick out.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.146
Well, to be honest, uh,
it would be my penis head pulled out.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.649
I'm the genius that came up
with the whole concept, the idea.

19:09.732 --> 19:10.983
I'm not gonna pull my dick out.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.693
Oh, okay.
That's a cute little cartoon,

19:12.777 --> 19:14.195
but did you build the motherfucker?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.614
- Yeah, no, we have.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we built it.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.532
And there's actually
some new features too,

19:18.616 --> 19:19.950
like, uh, friend-control mode,

19:20.034 --> 19:23.371
where, uh, you can actually control
the person wearing the Skintendo Joysuit.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.498
It's... it's revolutionary.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.292
Damn. Oh, yo, yo,
I'm gonna need, like, three of those

19:28.376 --> 19:30.503
for, like, blap, blap, blap.
You know what I'm saying?

19:30.586 --> 19:33.005
'Cause I love fucking white women.
Makes me feel powerful,

19:33.089 --> 19:35.249
especially if I can control them,
you know what I mean?

19:35.633 --> 19:39.804
Yes! I forgot about friend-control mode.
But you know who didn't forget about it?

19:39.887 --> 19:43.099
Sony and Microsoft
when we pitched them this idea.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.851
And they were super into it.
But you know what I said to them?

19:45.935 --> 19:47.311
Fuck y'all!

19:47.395 --> 19:49.772
'Cause the Dew'd Crew
wants to do business with the Bey.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.982
The Dew'd Crew? Wait, wait, wait.
Time-out, time-out.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.651
'Cause y'all drink mad Mountain Dew?

19:53.734 --> 19:54.819
- [gasps]
- You got it!

19:54.902 --> 19:56.195
Yes, that's exactly right.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
- How did you...
- Wow.

19:57.405 --> 20:01.409
Yo, motherfucker, me too! Holy shit, dude!

20:01.492 --> 20:04.578
- You ever fuck with Baja Blast?
- [Bey] Oh, you know I do. You know I do!

20:04.704 --> 20:05.764
- So good.
- [Bey] Ah, man...

20:05.788 --> 20:07.623
- Code Red over here!
- This is Code Red boy.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.874
Fuck, I love you guys!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.544
Let's talk numbers.
How much money we talking about?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.671
Bey Awadi. Sorry, this... this feels like

20:13.754 --> 20:16.549
just the sort of frivolous investment
we spoke about not partaking in.

20:16.632 --> 20:21.053
My dude, just because you told me not to,
why don't you "par-take" my checkbook out

20:21.137 --> 20:24.306
and then write these motherfuckers
a check

20:24.390 --> 20:27.518
for 200-frivolous-fucking-thousand-dollars

20:27.601 --> 20:30.855
so they can chase their goddamn dreams?
Am I right? Yezzir.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.778
Oh, and then please scrub out
my hyena's pussy,

20:32.857 --> 20:34.650
'cause I'm trying to fuck that shit later.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.193
- [laughter]
- You should fuck it.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.653
Treat yo'self. Oh, my God!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.029
Cool. Get the fuck out of here.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.216
- Oh, my God. Yeah. Okay.
- [Bey] Go. Get out, get out.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.825
[Alexxx] We'll talk more numbers later.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.160
- Thank you.
- Bye, take care.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.121
All right, y'all.
I'm spending paper tonight.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.524
[Alexxx] It's just the beginning!

20:49.081 --> 20:50.249
Not happening.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.919
Apologies, Corky.
Let's go, boys. Let's go.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.463
Let's go!

20:55.546 --> 20:58.883
Cassie! Cassie! Tums!

20:59.425 --> 21:00.801
Tums, meet me at the elevator.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.386
- Come on, boys.
- But our check.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.305
[grunts, groans]

21:04.388 --> 21:06.557
- [crowd gasps]
- [Joel groaning]

21:06.640 --> 21:08.309
[coughing]

21:08.392 --> 21:09.769
[intense music playing]

21:09.852 --> 21:11.771
- Fuck off.
- [hoarsely] Yeah, I was just...

21:13.481 --> 21:14.815
Yeah, we're going.

21:14.899 --> 21:18.319
- Get up. Get out of here.
- [Joel whimpering] Ow. Goddamn.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.951
These three idiots just tried to sell
a goddamn video game to the Bey!

21:26.035 --> 21:27.536
I thought I told you to sack up!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.872
[stammers, chuckles] I'm sorry. I didn't...

21:29.955 --> 21:32.541
You didn't...
you didn't want that promotion?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.335
Yeah, you made that pretty clear.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.213
Boys! You're fired.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.465
- Yeah.
- No fucking way, Mitch.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.466
He was assaulted.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.426
[Mitch] Out! Out you go!

21:43.469 --> 21:45.221
- [grumbling] We're going.
- Cassie...

21:46.639 --> 21:49.475
- [sighs] ...get back to work.
- [Cassie] Yes, sir.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.607
That's quite a stiff arm
you got there, huh?

21:56.690 --> 22:00.402
You all right? Huh?
That paw of yours need a little ice?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657
- My hand is fine.
- Ah.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.201
Well, how about a little ice
for those nipples, huh?

22:07.284 --> 22:11.163
[ominous music playing]

22:11.247 --> 22:13.624
[laughing] Oh-ho-ho-ho.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.084
Yeah, you like that, huh?

22:15.709 --> 22:16.752
Oh, that's hot.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.380
Oh, that is hot, lady.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.798
You wanna play?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.591
- [Mitch] I do.
- [Erma] Okay.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.469
- [Mitch] Oh, I knew it. Oh.
- [Erma] What about this?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.555
- Yeah. Ooh.
- Mm.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.682
Speaking of stiff... [chuckles]

22:30.516 --> 22:31.976
- [flesh squelches]
- [shouts]

22:32.059 --> 22:33.727
- [blood squirts]
- [Erma cackles]

22:33.811 --> 22:36.063
Not my pecker! [groans dizzily]

22:36.146 --> 22:38.023
[groans softly]

22:38.107 --> 22:40.150
[whispering] Whoopsie-daisy.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.528
- [Alexxx grunts angrily]
- All I'm saying is,

22:42.611 --> 22:44.863
you win some, you lose some.

22:44.947 --> 22:48.492
The key to our jiggy fuckin' lifestyle
is tucked in that butler's pocket.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.078
My name is Alexxx with three Xs.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.874
I'm about to go explosive
on these motherfuckers!

22:56.959 --> 22:58.586
Three X means "poison," by the way.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.797
- Uh, it's also a Vin Diesel movie.
- [muttering] Shut the fuck up.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.799
Yeah, well, it's also
spicy barbecue sauce.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.510
But I think we all know
I meant it in the explicit fashion!

23:06.594 --> 23:09.805
[dance music playing faintly]

23:09.888 --> 23:12.600
My darling, have you lost
your fucking mind?

23:13.350 --> 23:16.228
Get him out of here. If they see him
before we secure the build...

23:16.312 --> 23:18.188
[intense music playing]

23:18.814 --> 23:20.399
[Alexxx shouts]

23:21.108 --> 23:22.192
[growls]

23:24.445 --> 23:25.696
[Conrad] Lock down all exits.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.824
<i>We have three waiters on the run
and they know.</i>

23:28.907 --> 23:30.951
<i>Donald, it's time.</i>

23:31.493 --> 23:32.536
Copy that.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.413
[knocking]

23:34.496 --> 23:38.334
Hey, fellas. Bey Awadi's security here.
We just have one question.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.501
What's your question?

23:39.585 --> 23:42.171
- Do you wanna die?
- What?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.342
[stammering] Whoa, hey, hey.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.843
[men muttering indistinctly]

24:00.481 --> 24:03.275
[paper crinkling]

24:03.359 --> 24:04.818
What, y'all don't pack a lunch?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.029
Man, take these clowns up to the roof
with the rest.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.572
- [guard] Okay.
- Let's go.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.490
[guard] Easy, man.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.116
Locking down perimeter now.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.328
[Conrad] <i>Attention, all units.
</i> Operation Trespass begins now.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.333
- [gunshot, people screaming]
- Sweep the hotel.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.375
Lock and arm all exits
with breach sensors.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.001
- We are taking over.
- [gun firing]

24:21.085 --> 24:23.212
- Move! Get down, stay down.
- Hey, everybody be calm!

24:23.295 --> 24:25.589
Just do what they say.
Everything's gonna be okay.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.299
Right? [quietly] Right?

24:27.383 --> 24:30.094
- [people screaming]
- [Bey] Oh!

24:30.177 --> 24:33.347
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

24:33.430 --> 24:35.391
- [Lil Puma whimpers]
- [Bey] Shit. Fuck.

24:36.350 --> 24:39.019
Yo, what the fuck, man?
You're supposed to be guarding the party.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.646
Party's over.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.233
[intense music playing]

24:48.904 --> 24:50.656
[Joel hyperventilating]

24:50.739 --> 24:52.658
[splutters] Darren,
stop vaping, all right?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.327
- I can't breathe!
- Just shut up! Okay?

24:55.411 --> 24:57.287
As these doors open,
they're gonna be waiting,

24:57.371 --> 24:59.248
ready to cut cocks.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.542
We'll hide. Hide in the shaft.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.544
- Here, just help me up. Help me up.
- What?

25:03.627 --> 25:06.588
- Ow. Just... what are you doing?
- Oh... oh!

25:06.672 --> 25:08.132
- I found the latch.
- Oh, seriously?

25:08.215 --> 25:09.895
- I think I found it.
- Well, go... get in.

25:10.801 --> 25:11.801
[elevator dings]

25:13.846 --> 25:15.055
Shit.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.474
They climbed into the elevator shaft.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.310
They could be anywhere.
Keep your eyes open.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.422
- [elevator dings]
- Gotta just get the thing...

25:30.446 --> 25:33.574
- You said you found a latch.
- No, I said I think I found a latch.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.200
- Shut up, Baby Dunc.
- [Joel panting]

25:35.284 --> 25:36.284
Whoa.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.703
No one's there.

25:38.746 --> 25:39.872
Follow me.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.833
Wait, I think we should turn ourselves in.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.917
What? No. Go!

25:44.001 --> 25:45.753
Not turning ourselves in.
That's pussy shit.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.196
They might appreciate the gesture.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.134
Yeah, and they might cut our dicks off.
We gotta get out and go for help.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.509
We're not gonna go for help.
Slide down this rail.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.927
- It'll be badass.
- What?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.304
[Alexxx] Yeah.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.722
[shouting]

25:57.431 --> 25:58.932
[Alexxx] Oh! Oh, shit.

25:59.016 --> 26:02.102
- [hoarsely] I need help.
- [Alexxx] That was not badass. Come on!

26:04.980 --> 26:07.775
[ominous music playing]

26:07.858 --> 26:09.693
All exits confirmed as locked.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.528
No sign of the waiters.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.326
They locked the doors
and we don't have our phones!

26:17.409 --> 26:19.369
- We're screwed!
- No shit, Baby Dunc.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.496
We gotta get a landline.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.505
Clear.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.052
- I got two.
- Quick, take 'em up with the rest.

26:35.469 --> 26:36.804
<i>- Ándale, bitch.
- [maids whimper]</i>

26:36.887 --> 26:40.098
[all panting]

26:42.434 --> 26:43.685
Let's move.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.067
- [key scanner beeps]
- [Erma] Tie them together.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.820
One collar per group.

26:52.903 --> 26:55.739
Now, listen up... if you want to live.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.908
These collars are linked to sensors

26:57.991 --> 27:02.579
that we have placed
at every entrance of this building.

27:02.663 --> 27:06.917
Anyone who attempts to enter or exit,

27:07.501 --> 27:08.919
they detonate.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.088
It's fucked up, right?

27:11.171 --> 27:13.382
- You missed me.
- [Conrad] Collect their cell phones

27:13.465 --> 27:15.300
if they still have them.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.053
And if they try anything funny, well...

27:18.136 --> 27:19.263
[grunts]

27:19.972 --> 27:23.058
...refrain from killing anyone
unless I tell you.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.351
We're not here to murder.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.395
We're here to collect a toll
from Bey Awadi

27:26.478 --> 27:28.981
for trespassing on American soil.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.275
You ain't touching my stacks, bro.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.776
Really?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.820
"In case of threat of violence
or act of terror,

27:34.903 --> 27:37.239
please do not challenge
or defy assailants.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.074
Comply with their demands at all times."

27:39.158 --> 27:41.160
Did you read that in the manual
or something?

27:41.243 --> 27:42.578
No.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.288
Well, yes, but... who cares?

27:44.371 --> 27:46.623
It gives me everything I need
to keep the hotel in order,

27:46.707 --> 27:49.001
- no matter what.
- This lady just shit her pants.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.669
Is that in the manual too?

27:50.752 --> 27:54.089
I... I did... I did not shit my pants.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.300
I just want to make that clear.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.968
Are you calling me a liar?

27:58.051 --> 28:00.804
No, I'm saying you're very smart
and you're picking up on something.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.765
Maybe someone...
someone did shit their pants.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.434
And I'm not gonna say who.

28:06.727 --> 28:08.854
- But someone.
- Get her out of here.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.107
- Yeah, get her out of here. Damn it.
- [Conrad] Get you out of here.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.610
- [squelching]
- Oh, it's dripping.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.903
And now it hit my anklet.

28:15.986 --> 28:17.863
- [growls]
- And my toe ring.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.907
- [computer beeping]
- [keys clacking]

28:19.990 --> 28:21.325
We are locked down, boss.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.536
And I'm very close
to accessing the offshore accounts.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.704
<i>I know, I know.</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:28.040
"Close only counts
in horseshoes and hand grenades."

28:28.832 --> 28:30.083
I wasn't gonna say that.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.710
The phones are dead.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.129
No Internet either. No Wi-Fi, no DSL.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.382
Jesus, this guy has so many tabs open.
It's stressing me the fuck out.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.551
[Alexxx] Guys, they cut the lines.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.928
It's what they do.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.223
[darkly] It's... what I'd do.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.142
Hey, stop talking cool. Okay?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.687
[man] Clear.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.862
Oh, my God. There's two guys
out there with guns.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.906
- They're coming this way.
- That's it. I'm done.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.283
Wait, what are you...
What's with the pockets?

29:03.367 --> 29:05.494
- I'm showing them I'm unarmed.
- [Alexxx] Shut up.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.537
We can think of something.
We can take 'em.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.039
Darren, just think of something.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.041
I can't. I got nothing, man.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.086
- I... [stammers, coughs]
- Fine.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.297
- What are you...
- [Alexxx] I got an idea.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.467
I haven't done this in a long time.

29:31.979 --> 29:35.232
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.241
Whoa!

29:44.324 --> 29:45.867
What the fuck?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.121
Look at this freaky fuck.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.665
Hey, Rich, come in here.
You gotta see this.

29:54.835 --> 29:55.752
Jesus.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.879
Rest in peace, you horny bastard.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.985
- What's your problem?
- [exhales heavily]

30:02.009 --> 30:03.969
I just don't like the way
this job is going.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.805
- Everything's falling apart.
- Ah. Hey, hey, hey.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.142
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be sitting poolside

30:10.225 --> 30:12.019
sipping Coronas in Cabo, right?

30:14.062 --> 30:16.148
I just don't wanna see you getting hurt.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.108
You're sweet.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.152
I love you.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.906
I love you too.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.243
[sensual music playing]

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
- Yeah.
- Real quick.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.416
Okay, yeah.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.758
[chuckles]

30:50.098 --> 30:52.100
[men moaning softly]

30:52.184 --> 30:53.894
[whispering] Ew, right?

30:57.314 --> 30:59.232
- [whispering] Stop!
- [whispering] Sorry. Hey.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.360
Hmm?

31:01.443 --> 31:05.113
[whispering] You go around,
grab the corner of the sheet...

31:05.197 --> 31:08.116
[tense music playing]

31:17.667 --> 31:18.667
Psst!

31:21.713 --> 31:23.590
[Joel shouting]

31:23.673 --> 31:25.008
[all shouting]

31:25.092 --> 31:27.302
[shrieking]

31:27.386 --> 31:28.970
[grunting]

31:29.054 --> 31:30.764
Hit 'em with the lamp!

31:30.847 --> 31:32.057
[screams] Wha... [shouts]

31:32.140 --> 31:35.268
- [all grunting]
- [shouting]

31:35.352 --> 31:36.645
[groans]

31:39.189 --> 31:40.649
Oh, I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.900
[shouts]

31:41.983 --> 31:43.860
- [gasps, wheezes]
- Are you all right?

31:43.944 --> 31:46.113
[wheezing]

31:46.196 --> 31:47.322
Rich? Rich?

31:48.573 --> 31:49.616
[grunts]

31:50.534 --> 31:52.536
- [Joel] Ow.
- [Darren] Uh...

31:52.619 --> 31:55.789
Oh! Freeze! Shit.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.041
You just killed the man of my dreams.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.727
- Now you're gonna die.
- [Darren] No, no.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.171
He's just knocked out. Like the movie
<i>Friday. "He got knocked the fuck out!"</i>

32:05.590 --> 32:07.092
[growling]

32:07.175 --> 32:09.052
[gripping music playing]

32:10.429 --> 32:13.557
[choking] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I killed him.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.640
I'll be your boyfriend.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.355
- [growling]
- [grunts]

32:23.900 --> 32:25.068
I didn't do it.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.492
[gasping]

32:32.576 --> 32:34.411
Baby Dunc, are you okay?

32:34.494 --> 32:36.329
[both gasping]

32:36.413 --> 32:37.664
I think you killed him.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.000
[wheezing]

32:40.083 --> 32:41.543
[gasping] Sorry I didn't help,

32:41.626 --> 32:44.713
but I got punched in the chest
really hard one time.

32:46.756 --> 32:50.093
We killed the bad guys. My plan worked!

32:50.177 --> 32:51.303
What... hey, stop it!

32:51.386 --> 32:53.054
Your plan didn't work.
You got them horny

32:53.138 --> 32:54.639
and got me 300 kicked in the chest.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.224
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

32:56.308 --> 32:58.560
We got these bitches
right where we want them.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.188
- Now we gotta just go through their shit.
- Alexxx, no! No!

33:01.271 --> 33:03.431
Leave their stuff alone.
You're gonna make them madder.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.962
Baby Dunc, what are you talking about?
This is video games 101.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.987
- You kill bad guys, you take their shit.
- It's true.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.447
Like you never played video games.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.240
- Go close the fucking door.
- Okay, yeah.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.450
We got zip ties.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.706
We got a fucking gun.
We got a big-ass knife.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.584
By the way, I get next kill.
You guys are being total kill hogs...

33:22.667 --> 33:25.670
- [gunshot]
- [all shouting]

33:25.754 --> 33:29.090
- What did you do?
- Okay, and that is where the trigger is.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.814
- Oh, my God.
- [Alexxx] Now we know that.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.469
I'm gonna go put on pants, so...

33:33.053 --> 33:34.638
Oh, yeah, no. Good call, good call,

33:34.721 --> 33:37.849
you're gonna wanna be fully clothed
when you fucking blow your head off, man!

33:37.933 --> 33:39.851
Why are you getting dressed in the closet?

33:39.935 --> 33:41.895
We've already seen
your dick, balls, and butthole.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.106
- You guys saw my butthole?
- A lot.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.776
- I haven't shaved in months.
- [Darren] Okay, this is it.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.029
I'm stressing out. Alexxx, get back here
and sell me salvia right now, man!

33:51.112 --> 33:53.782
Yeah, Darren,
I'm not gonna sell you salvia right now

33:53.865 --> 33:57.118
'cause we're kind of under attack
from terrorists.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.922
Every time you open that, I see your dick.
We need to get outta here.

33:59.996 --> 34:04.000
We need to get away from bad people.
We need to get help from good people.

34:04.084 --> 34:07.337
If you wanna bail on the Bey
and the Skintendo Joysuit to go get help,

34:07.420 --> 34:09.047
fine, we can do that.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.924
But we gotta do it in a badass fashion,

34:11.007 --> 34:13.176
or we're gonna look
like total fucking pussies.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.553
We are pussies!

34:14.636 --> 34:17.196
- We don't have to look like it, Baby Dunc!
- Don't call me that.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.724
Darren, think of something dope
and badass to get us out.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.226
- What?
- Baby Dunc, implement the thing

34:22.310 --> 34:24.563
that Darren's about to think of. Go.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.940
I'm not coming up with the plan, okay?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.612
[up-tempo video game music playing]

34:37.492 --> 34:40.411
- Shit! I thought of something.
- What?

34:40.495 --> 34:41.788
Is it something I can build?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.623
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.835
Why do I have to be
so goddamn industrious?

34:47.502 --> 34:50.422
[Alexxx] Hey, guys?
If you guys thought my dick was small,

34:50.505 --> 34:52.465
it's 'cause the AC
was really blasting earlier.

34:52.549 --> 34:53.592
So that's the reason.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.012
- [whispering] It's super hot, right?
- It's very hot.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.096
Alexxx, I...

34:59.055 --> 35:00.682
you've got nothing to be ashamed of.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.646
[tense music playing]

35:06.730 --> 35:09.941
If you... don't pull too much on this one,
'cause then this one gets pulled.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.070
What the fuck, man?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.531
Eagle Eye has been watching you,
Bey Awadi.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.951
The... the U.S. militia faction?
What do they want with him?

35:20.035 --> 35:22.203
Sometimes the government's
politically correct hands

35:22.287 --> 35:24.497
get tied in knots, forcing people
to protect their lands

35:24.581 --> 35:26.291
from unwanted invasions.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.917
[scoffs] "Invasions."

35:28.251 --> 35:29.753
I'm not a fuckin' invader, bro.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.464
I love America. I went to Florida State.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.632
Peep the bill, bro.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.717
I'm here to have fun, fuck,

35:35.800 --> 35:37.636
drink, pop Molly.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.262
What's more American than that, bro?

35:39.346 --> 35:40.513
Money.

35:40.597 --> 35:43.391
Five hundred million dollars
transferred into an offshore account.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.895
[chuckling] Five hundred million?
You are crazy, Mr. Albino Bad Guy.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.271
That's not gonna happen.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.190
He doesn't have that kind of cash flow.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.692
I-it's all tied up in assets, uh, bonds...

35:53.193 --> 35:56.863
Does this free up some of those assets?

35:56.946 --> 35:58.426
- [gun cocks, people gasp]
- I get it.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.451
This is a prank.
It's just kind of dark, man, like...

36:01.534 --> 36:03.370
Knoxville, you can come out now!

36:03.745 --> 36:06.206
No! Steve-O! Steve, you okay?

36:06.289 --> 36:09.125
- Come on, man. We told you we can't.
- Th-th-there is a way.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.753
Oh, dear.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.839
An account a-access code.
Only, uh, he and his father have it.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.508
What the fuck are you doing?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.551
He's playing nice.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.804
Now it's your turn.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.723
I can't, okay?
If... if I give you those codes,

36:23.807 --> 36:26.142
- my dad'll kill me, a'ight?
- What's its name?

36:26.226 --> 36:28.645
[Bey] Wh... what?

36:28.728 --> 36:29.646
The dog.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.314
- [Bey] The dog?
- [Lil Puma whines]

36:31.398 --> 36:33.149
- [Conrad] Mm.
- Lil Puma.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.734
Little Puma. Hi, pal.

36:34.818 --> 36:37.445
- [growls]
- Oh, that's a good boy.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.905
Come to Uncle Conrad.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.865
We have a couple
of those extra breach sensors.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.659
Get them with a corresponding collar.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.370
Be careful with his hip dysplasia, please.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.581
Of course, of course.
You know, I love dogs. Big dogs, usually.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.417
Little dogs not much, but this one

36:50.500 --> 36:52.353
- has a great personality.
- [Lil Puma whimpers]

36:52.377 --> 36:54.254
No, no, no. What... what are you doing?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.758
There you go, Lil Puma. Go get it, boy.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.762
- [Conrad] Oh, thank you very much.
- [Bey] Don't do it.

37:02.846 --> 37:03.847
Puma, stay. Stay, Puma.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.516
- [sensors beeping]
- No!

37:06.599 --> 37:09.602
[collar beeping]

37:10.979 --> 37:12.230
Why is this thing beeping?

37:12.814 --> 37:15.608
- [all screaming]
- Oh, shit!

37:15.692 --> 37:17.068
[people screaming]

37:17.444 --> 37:19.571
- [woman shrieks]
- [blood spurts]

37:19.654 --> 37:20.947
[woman sobbing]

37:21.531 --> 37:24.909
I must have given you the nine...
which was upside down.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.245
That is my bad.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.998
[inhales sharply] The lesson still stands.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.793
The account numbers,
or there will be more bloodshed.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.213
Do it, Bey Awadi.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.801
Okay. Okay, clear. Go.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.136
- [Darren] Ready?
- [Joel] Yeah.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.512
[both grunt]

37:48.808 --> 37:51.644
Zip-tie zip line. Baby Dunc, you genius.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.439
Uh, it was my idea. [scoffs]
You know, I saw the scaffolding.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.982
I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

37:56.065 --> 37:58.109
- Okay, it's fine. Good work.
- Thanks.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.489
Okay. Are you ready to be Tom Brady?
Because that's what's about to go down.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.241
You're gonna become Tom Brady, Alexxx.

38:05.325 --> 38:06.552
- Fuckin' Tom Brady, dog.
- Yes.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.256
- Yeah, you're Tom Brady.
- Tom Brady, dog!

38:08.286 --> 38:10.663
- Yeah, you're Tom Brady.
- [both barking]

38:10.789 --> 38:13.583
- Shh.
- [both barking softly]

38:13.666 --> 38:16.252
Here we go. [breathing purposefully]

38:16.336 --> 38:19.047
[gripping music playing]

38:20.340 --> 38:22.884
[all cheering]

38:22.967 --> 38:25.094
- [laughing excitedly]
- I'm Tom Brady!

38:25.178 --> 38:26.888
- Tom Brady!
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪</i>

38:26.971 --> 38:29.974
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪
- [Darren] The what? What? Brady Bunch?</i>

38:30.642 --> 38:32.560
Do you think Tom Brady
is in The Brady Bunch?

38:33.561 --> 38:35.188
Yeah, it's the dad, right?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.648
- No.
- No, he isn't.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.191
Oh, I thought that's who we...

38:38.274 --> 38:41.569
He was cool, though. He was really cool.
He had a hell of a... arm.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.113
Okay, why don't you just show us
how my zip line works, Joel?

38:44.197 --> 38:46.324
- Yeah.
- Right, right. Um...

38:46.407 --> 38:50.578
Okay, so basically,
I rigged up this ironing board,

38:50.662 --> 38:52.163
- like a harness.
- [Darren] Right.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.791
[Joel] And then you kind of use it
like a hang glider. Okay...

38:54.874 --> 38:56.060
- [Alexxx] Yeah?
- [Joel] Yeah.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.627
Kevin McCallister would be proud.

38:57.710 --> 38:58.920
Maybe even Tom Brady.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.564
- Don't talk about Tom Brady.
- Who's he?

39:00.588 --> 39:02.548
- Just don't talk about him.
- [Darren] All right.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.591
[Alexxx] Quarterback.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.301
[Darren] Here's what we're gonna do.

39:05.385 --> 39:08.596
We are gonna shoot rock, paper, scissors
to find out who goes first.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.057
Okay, but no "two out of three" bullshit.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.684
- Whoever wins wins.
- Right.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.529
- Fair and square, right? Okay.
- Yes, yeah.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.354
[together] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.022
- [Darren] Yes.
- Fuck!

39:18.106 --> 39:19.983
- [Joel] Thank God. [exhales]
- [Alexxx] Fuck!

39:20.066 --> 39:22.110
Let's go again. Two out of three.
Let's be fair.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.171
- What? You just said...
- No, do not do this, okay?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.406
It could've happened to any of us,
just happened to you.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.701
Yeah, maybe, or maybe hella long ago,
you guys were like,

39:29.784 --> 39:33.538
"If we ever do rock, paper, scissors
with Alexxx, we should shoot paper."

39:33.621 --> 39:34.914
[gasps]

39:34.998 --> 39:37.625
Because two guys shooting paper,
that's suspect.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.043
- [Darren] I can't...
- Yeah.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.967
[Joel] Okay, just forget it.
Let's shoot again.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.274
- [Darren] What? No.
- [Alexxx] Yes, thank you, Baby Dunc.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.675
- How about, don't be a sore loser?
- Don't call me a loser.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.260
[Joel] Hey, guys, stop fighting.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.928
We'll make a dummy and do a test run.

39:49.012 --> 39:52.348
- We have a dummy right here.
- No, we'll just use one of the dead bo...

39:52.432 --> 39:54.893
- [all screaming]
- [shouting, sobbing]

39:54.976 --> 39:58.021

Oh, my God!

40:13.161 --> 40:17.040
[all screaming]

40:17.874 --> 40:19.959
- [Joel] Oh, God!
- [all gasping]

40:20.043 --> 40:25.214
[gripping music playing]

40:25.298 --> 40:26.466
A little help.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.550
Help!

40:28.843 --> 40:30.178
Oh, fuck.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.558
[keys clacking]

40:37.226 --> 40:39.604
Hey, give me half your Which Wich.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.522
Well,
if I wanted to eat a half a sandwich,

40:41.606 --> 40:43.316
I'd have brought half a sandwich, Chet.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.692
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.569
You the one installing
a seven-layer firewall

40:46.653 --> 40:49.697
to mask a $1/2-billion transaction
at the world's third-largest bank

40:49.781 --> 40:52.116
using only your wife's tablet,
or is that me?

40:52.200 --> 40:53.743
[chuckling] Oh, that's right. It's me.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.161
[laughs]

40:55.244 --> 40:57.830
[Dew'd Crew screaming distantly]

40:59.540 --> 41:01.250
- Way to go, Baby Dunc.
- Huh?

41:01.334 --> 41:03.294
What? You... [stammers] This is your plan!

41:03.378 --> 41:05.755
No, I said, "Home Alone-style zip line."

41:05.838 --> 41:07.507
This is Home Alone 3 at best.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.070
We were supposed to look cool as shit
coming out of the window,

41:10.134 --> 41:11.134
doing a badass exit.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.304
Now we look like a bunch of losers
hanging up here.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.472
[Joel] Oh, God.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.015
[siren blips]

41:16.557 --> 41:18.685
- [Alexxx] What the fuck?
- [Joel gasping] The police!

41:18.768 --> 41:19.936
[Darren] Hey, we're up here!

41:20.019 --> 41:22.522
[Joel] Thank you so much. Thank you, God.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.233
Police! Yeah! Holla! Hooty-hoo!

41:25.316 --> 41:28.861
- [laughing] Oh! Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

41:28.945 --> 41:31.197
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing up there?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.866
There are people in the hotel with guns!

41:33.992 --> 41:35.660
- No!
- Shooting people!

41:35.743 --> 41:37.370
- You're all fuckin' pigs!
- Get us down!

41:37.453 --> 41:38.746
[Alexxx] Fuck you, copper!

41:38.830 --> 41:40.581
They're here to help us.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.292
We're not gonna look cool as shit
getting saved by the LAPD.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.919
Do you even listen to Kendrick Lamar?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.838
Are there people up there with guns
or not?

41:46.963 --> 41:48.563
Yes, there are! That is one right there!

41:48.631 --> 41:50.751
He is a man with a gun.
He tried to cut off our dicks.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.011
Oh, fuck you.
You wish I touched your dick.

41:53.094 --> 41:55.054
We're coming up there.
What room number is that?

41:55.138 --> 41:57.974
- Nine seventeen!
- [officer] We're coming up there now!

41:58.057 --> 41:59.100
Don't fucking move.

41:59.642 --> 42:02.562
[ominous music playing]

42:05.148 --> 42:06.691
LAPD. Open the door.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.362
Are you aware you've got three waiters

42:11.446 --> 42:13.239
hanging outside the ninth-floor window?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.826
Sir, walking away from a cop
is a bad idea.

42:16.909 --> 42:20.163
I will arrest you for obstruction.
Open the fucking door!

42:20.246 --> 42:21.748
- Shit.
- [machine gun firing]

42:24.208 --> 42:26.210
Officer down! Officer down!

42:26.294 --> 42:27.795
Hank, I need backup!

42:27.879 --> 42:30.465
I got you, Danny. I'm calling for backup.
I'm coming right now.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.383
- [officer] Stay there!
- No! No, no, no!

42:32.467 --> 42:35.094
- Don't leave us up here.
- Guys, it's too late. Okay?

42:35.178 --> 42:36.721
Let's wiggle our asses back in there,

42:36.804 --> 42:38.848
kill some bad guys,
and get our fucking check back.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.516
I'm not risking my life for the check.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.769
Why not? It's our dreams, right?

42:42.852 --> 42:46.647
No! The check is your dream.
My dream is just working on Skintendo.

42:46.731 --> 42:47.857
But now you can!

42:47.940 --> 42:50.860
And we are! Okay? We have been!

42:50.943 --> 42:52.343
- Baby Dunc...
- [Joel] Without you!

42:52.403 --> 42:53.404
[dramatic music playing]

42:55.615 --> 42:57.450
Oh, what the fuck?

42:57.533 --> 42:58.701
- [beeps]
- [Donald gasps]

42:58.785 --> 43:00.870
Band-Aids and butter beans! We're online.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.207
Conrad, we're online.
Awaiting an access code.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.002
[Conrad] Speak clearly.

43:09.212 --> 43:10.671
And speak quickly.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.633
Fuck. Fuck!

43:14.300 --> 43:15.300
Fifty-three...

43:16.385 --> 43:17.386
Twenty-two...

43:18.554 --> 43:20.098
Zero two...

43:20.181 --> 43:21.432
Zero two...

43:21.516 --> 43:24.602
- [Bey] Thirty-three...
- Thirty-three...

43:24.685 --> 43:26.646

43:26.729 --> 43:28.397
[metal scraping]

43:28.481 --> 43:30.399
I want verbal confirmation
from you, Darren.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.527
Are you working on the fucking game
without me?

43:33.152 --> 43:34.152
Affirmative.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.365
You motherfuckers!

43:37.448 --> 43:40.159
I'm gonna wiggle us back in there,
you backstabbing bitches!

[metal clanking]

43:41.536 --> 43:44.330
[all screaming]

43:46.207 --> 43:48.209
Sixty-nine, 420, 69.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.211
- I'm serious!
- [Chet] Sixty-nine, 69, 69.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.294
Oh, shit!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.631
[all screaming]

43:53.714 --> 43:55.842
- [glass shatters]
- [electricity pops]

43:56.175 --> 43:57.593
What the fuck?

43:58.636 --> 43:59.636
[groaning]

44:01.556 --> 44:02.723
[Donald] Conrad, hold on.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.852
Shit.

44:05.935 --> 44:07.061
We've had a breach.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.855
[grunts] Oh, God.

44:08.938 --> 44:10.398
Sixth floor, security room.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.900
What do you mean? Who... who is it?

44:12.984 --> 44:15.236
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

44:16.404 --> 44:17.697
Huh? You SWAT?

44:18.197 --> 44:19.365
Are you SEALs?

44:19.448 --> 44:20.867
Transporters?

44:21.742 --> 44:24.829
Answer me right the fuck now,
or I'll plug you in three seconds.

44:24.912 --> 44:25.912
[all] Uh...

44:27.790 --> 44:29.500
[grunts]

44:29.584 --> 44:30.960
- One...
- No.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.170
[Darren] Please.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.173
- Two...
- Please.

[shouts]

44:37.466 --> 44:39.927
[tense music playing]

44:40.469 --> 44:41.929
- No!
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait...

- Three!

- Oh, fuck.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.522
Oh... oh, my God.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.275
I'm a genius! I wiggled us back in.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.445
[laughing] Whoo!

44:57.528 --> 45:00.281
[Conrad] <i>Donald, kill them
</i> and then enter the code.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.033
<i>You do have the code, right, Donald?</i>

45:02.783 --> 45:03.618
<i>Donald?</i>

45:03.701 --> 45:04.785
[distorted] Donald?

45:04.869 --> 45:05.870
[stammers]

45:07.914 --> 45:09.832
There's a cop at the lobby door.
We shot him.

45:10.541 --> 45:11.751
But he got away.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.894
Why are you looking at me like that, huh?

45:16.923 --> 45:18.633
You're the sneaky fucks.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.093
The backstabbers,
the betrayers, the Judas...

45:21.177 --> 45:22.345
Judases? Judas?

45:22.428 --> 45:25.973
The one that betrayed Jesus? Judas, right?

45:26.057 --> 45:27.516
Yeah, you're the fucking Judases.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.226
Let's stop with the name-calling, guys.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.645
- Backstabbers.
- [Darren] Great.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.813
Okay, guys, new rule: always double-check

45:32.897 --> 45:35.858
that dead bad guys
are actually dead bad guys.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.777
Holy shit!

45:37.860 --> 45:39.403
This is a dead bad guy!

45:40.154 --> 45:43.866
I don't know, I feel like my dead bad guy
is way worse than your dead bad guy.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.670
"My dead bad"?
That's not your dead bad guy.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.161
These are just dead bad guys.

45:47.244 --> 45:49.580
Looks like a human-sized
ketchup packet exploded.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.458
- [sighs] Damn it.
- What?

45:52.541 --> 45:54.061
Computer's busted. I can't get online.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.921
Yeah, he is full-on spaghetti
and meat sauce down here.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.383
- Guys. I found a phone.
- What?

46:02.760 --> 46:03.678
Wait a second.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.805
Why does the dead bad guy
have this dude's number?

46:05.888 --> 46:08.224
- Who?
- What are you, a fucking owl?

46:08.307 --> 46:10.810
Yeah, I would love to be an owl, Darren.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.562
So I could soar off into the night
hella majestically.

46:15.231 --> 46:17.942
[phone buzzing]

46:18.025 --> 46:22.488
[tense music playing]

46:22.571 --> 46:25.324
[whispering] Wait, you have a phone?
You have to call for help.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.995
- Shh. No.
- [growls, yips]

46:29.078 --> 46:30.329
I think he just screened me.

46:30.413 --> 46:32.999
He screened the dead guy.
Don't take it personally.

46:33.082 --> 46:34.375
[Darren] Shut up. Voicemail.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.752
Hey, this is Darren and Joel.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.045
Yeah, I'm here too, so...

46:38.129 --> 46:41.048
And Alexxx.
The, uh... the Dew'd Crew from the roof.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.299
- Remember?
- Say "Skintendo."

46:42.383 --> 46:44.218
We are calling
to find out what's going on.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.303
There's, like...
people shooting and stuff.

46:46.387 --> 46:49.427
Please give me a call back at this number,
uh, when it's a good time for you.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.599
Okay, give me the phone.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.536
- We'll talk then.
- It's not a conference call.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.562
We're not waiting for him to call back.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.189
You didn't even bring up
the two most important things:

46:57.273 --> 47:01.193
the Bey and, I don't know,
how about the fucking check?

47:01.277 --> 47:02.903
- Come on.
- The check.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.655
Mention a dead body. That'd be nice.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.379
Been a while since I've left a voicemail.

47:06.449 --> 47:07.658
I'm gonna call him back, so...

47:07.742 --> 47:09.994
It's rude to just call right back.
You leave a message,

47:10.077 --> 47:11.537
- let them call you back.
- Darren...

47:11.620 --> 47:14.457
[phone buzzing]

47:14.540 --> 47:17.293
[whispering] Ahmad, you dumb fuck.
You gotta call somebody, yo.

47:17.376 --> 47:20.713
- Fuck the police. Except for right now.
- [muttering] You're gonna get us killed.

47:20.796 --> 47:23.716
[Cassie] You didn't turn it in.
You're putting everyone's lives at risk.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.919
I'm sorry, is there something
we should be discussing?

47:25.968 --> 47:26.969
No.

47:27.053 --> 47:29.680
[phone buzzing]

47:32.725 --> 47:35.436
- [Bey] Hold up.
- [Conrad clears throat]

47:35.519 --> 47:38.814
- Why aren't you taking his phone?
- [phone buzzing]

47:38.898 --> 47:40.316
[Conrad] No, I don't see any phone.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.485
Um, you guys just be quiet over here.

47:42.568 --> 47:45.279
Your fucking creepy blue eyes
don't see the phone lighting up

47:45.362 --> 47:46.697
in his pocket right there?

47:46.781 --> 47:49.742
Also, it's making a noise.
It's going, "vuh, voo, vuh."

47:49.825 --> 47:51.327
- [Bey imitating buzzing]
- It's over!

47:52.161 --> 47:54.246
Cut me free. Now!

47:54.330 --> 47:57.249
[Conrad] Wait, wait, wait.
Hey... this is not my fault.

47:57.333 --> 48:00.169
Erma derailed the entire operation
the moment she got here.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.004
And has anyone noticed her accent?

48:02.088 --> 48:05.466
The German accent? It's fake!
She grew up in Pacoima!

48:05.549 --> 48:07.051
Come on. She's a lunatic!

48:07.134 --> 48:08.636
Is this true, Erma?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.805
Yeah, I'm a lunatic.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.766
No, no, no. [sighs] No. Give me...

48:13.849 --> 48:15.889
- Give me the gun.
- [scoffs] Gladly. See, told you.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.770
- I mean, what was I supposed to do?
- Right.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.647
Kill her. Like this.

48:28.364 --> 48:30.449
[exhales dramatically]

48:30.533 --> 48:32.743
[chuckles] Lovely.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.621
Honestly, did not know
I was gonna do that. [laughs]

48:35.704 --> 48:37.123
This whole thing was you?

48:37.206 --> 48:38.791
Mm, giving orders the whole time

48:38.874 --> 48:43.170
from the... "dusty-ass BlackBerry"
in my pocket.

48:43.254 --> 48:46.340
Physical keyboards
aren't so stupid now, are they?

48:46.423 --> 48:48.592
Nah, they're still dumb as fuck,

48:48.676 --> 48:52.596
and you still got atrocious-ass halitosis,
but I'm surprised.

48:52.680 --> 48:56.767
Yeah, well, at least my breath
doesn't smell like old-ass hyena pussy.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.435
- [phone buzzing]
- [sighing] Oh, God.

49:01.438 --> 49:05.234
- Hello, Donald, you cheeky sausage.
- What?

49:06.610 --> 49:08.028
No, I think that Donald guy's dead.

49:08.112 --> 49:09.655
He either was sucked out of a window,

49:09.738 --> 49:11.949
or he choked on a computer.
So what's going on up there?

49:12.032 --> 49:14.910
- [whispering] Speakerphone.
- Who is this?

49:14.994 --> 49:17.013
- [whispering] Speaker.
- I'm going on speakerphone.

49:17.037 --> 49:18.038
- Dew'd Crew here.
- Hey.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.456
Lumber Jacks...

49:19.540 --> 49:21.834
- What? Uh, hi?
- How's the Bey doing?

49:22.960 --> 49:25.004
Wait, why do you have this guy's number?

49:25.087 --> 49:26.630
[music intensifies]

49:26.714 --> 49:27.923
Wait, are you a bad guy too?

49:28.007 --> 49:30.259
Well, I suppose so, yes.

49:30.342 --> 49:35.598
But, um, you have just forced me
to become... unmistakably evil.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.603
Oh, fuck.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.980
I'll take the access codes now.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.063
Nah.

49:44.857 --> 49:47.902
Sorry, motherfucker. Can't do it.
That dude? I didn't know him.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.404
Shit, he might've let me live
if I gave him the codes.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.114
But you? Fuck you.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.783
I know if I give you the codes, I'm dead.

49:54.867 --> 49:56.619
And I know why. [chuckles]

49:56.702 --> 49:58.495
'Cause I made you eat that hooker's booty

49:58.579 --> 50:00.206
at my birthday party, isn't it?

50:00.289 --> 50:01.999
[Bey laughs]

50:02.082 --> 50:05.669
This motherfucker ate a hooker's booty.
You had crabs in your teeth for a week.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.630
- [giggling]
- [Bey] Remember shoving your face

50:07.713 --> 50:10.382
right up in that crab-infested
booty hole, bro?

50:10.466 --> 50:12.134
'Cause I do, you fucking loser.

50:12.218 --> 50:15.721
[laughing pointedly]
You dumb fucking fuck-hole.

50:15.804 --> 50:19.225
- [Bey] You fucking suck.
- Very well.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.852
I'll acquire my compensation another way.

50:21.936 --> 50:24.521
And while I wait to get paid, I'll...

50:24.605 --> 50:26.815
torture you. And kill you.

50:26.899 --> 50:30.653
Erma! We are sending a video
to the United States government.

50:30.736 --> 50:34.782
Oh! Also... bring me Shaggy.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.075
What the hell's going on?

50:36.617 --> 50:39.078
- [sirens wailing distantly]
- The fucking butler?

50:39.161 --> 50:41.288
[sirens growing louder]

50:41.372 --> 50:43.082
Hey, guys, check it out.

50:47.127 --> 50:48.504
[Darren] Whoa.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.130
Pigs brought the whole farm.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.592
- [Joel] Yeah.
- [Alexxx] Turn on the news.

50:53.676 --> 50:54.843
[Darren] Turn on the news.

50:55.636 --> 50:57.304
[Joel] Okay.

50:58.931 --> 51:00.307
[wailing] Steve-O!

51:00.391 --> 51:01.991
- There, there, there.
- [Chris] Steve-O!

51:02.059 --> 51:03.894
<i>Give me that mic. Give me that mic!</i>

51:03.978 --> 51:06.105

51:06.188 --> 51:08.315

51:08.399 --> 51:10.609
<i>It should've been you!
It should've been you.</i>

51:10.693 --> 51:13.362
[bleep] <i>you. And [bleep] </i> Channel 8.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.949

we've received a video</i>

<i>Good evening.</i>

51:24.206 --> 51:28.043
<i>As you probably know, I've taken control
of the Level Hotel, Los Angeles.</i>

51:28.669 --> 51:30.713
<i>I had intentions of only taking money</i>

51:30.796 --> 51:33.632
<i>from a disrespectful
and arrogant billionaire child...</i>

51:34.842 --> 51:37.970

by some idiotic waiters.</i>

51:38.512 --> 51:40.097
Are we the idiotics?

51:40.180 --> 51:41.724
No, stupid. We're maids.

51:41.807 --> 51:46.645
<i>So now I'm holding 106 hostages
until I receive $500 million</i>

51:46.729 --> 51:49.189
<i>and a helicopter,
which I will fly out of the U.S.</i>

51:49.273 --> 51:53.319
<i>and release... the remaining hostages.</i>

51:53.402 --> 51:57.197
<i>Oh, I should add: any breach
of this building will trigger...</i>

51:58.073 --> 52:00.242
<i>an explosive collar,</i>

52:00.326 --> 52:02.494

52:02.578 --> 52:06.749
<i>Additionally, I will kill one hostage
every 15 minutes</i>

52:06.832 --> 52:10.961
<i>to ensure prompt payment, starting... now.</i>

52:11.045 --> 52:13.339
- [metallic clang]
- [man] Oh, shit. That's hot.

52:13.422 --> 52:16.383
<i>Bro... listen, man, listen.
We brothers. We brothers.</i>

52:16.467 --> 52:18.719
<i>We're supposed to be brothers, man!</i>

another must-see TV moment:</i>

52:34.693 --> 52:37.863

52:39.448 --> 52:42.284
<i>- Yeah, uh...

53:42.678 --> 53:44.096
Uh, the conference room.

53:44.179 --> 53:47.474
But, ooh, it's dressed
for a convention tomorrow,

53:47.558 --> 53:50.238
so if you don't mind, I would appreciate
if we just stayed upstairs,

53:50.310 --> 53:51.437
not to mess it up.

Bilbo, Dildo, you come with me.

You take it.

You got legs. Use 'em.

54:10.581 --> 54:12.501
- Move it, people.
- What the fuck is the holdup?

54:12.541 --> 54:15.502
- Everybody out.
- Keep moving! Let's go!

54:15.586 --> 54:17.129

- Come on!

54:21.425 --> 54:22.509
[Joel] Darren, look.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.179
They're going inside.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.305
So what?

54:26.972 --> 54:28.307
So they're contained.

54:28.390 --> 54:31.435
You can't contain machine guns, Darren.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.562
How much salvia did you smoke?

54:34.771 --> 54:36.773
Shit, how much more do you have of that?

54:36.857 --> 54:39.735
I mean, there's a lot here,
but it is covered in glass.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.112
Not the sandwich, your salvia. How much?

54:42.196 --> 54:44.907
Oh, so now you want my help.

54:45.407 --> 54:46.783
Hmm, sure.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.619
Grab those guns and follow moi.

54:51.413 --> 54:54.333
[gripping electronic music playing]

54:57.794 --> 55:00.380
[Darren] You got glass.
You got glass in your hair.

55:04.051 --> 55:07.179
I'm flippin' keys.

55:07.262 --> 55:11.433
Well, not yet, actually.
I've got some serious rebranding to do.

55:11.517 --> 55:15.729
Turns out salvia isn't a very sexy drug
and no one likes it except for Darren...

55:15.812 --> 55:17.564
and, weirdly, the JV softball team.

55:17.648 --> 55:20.651
- Those girls get fuckin' wild.
- Okay, yeah, whatever, man.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.945
- This is perfect. This is great.
- Okay.

55:24.404 --> 55:27.074
Alexxx? Do you live here?

55:27.491 --> 55:29.284
Because it looks like you live here.

55:29.368 --> 55:32.287
I don't live here.
No, you know who I think lives here?

55:32.371 --> 55:33.455
Josué.

55:33.539 --> 55:36.750
Yeah, the maintenance guy?
That guy's... that guy's a weirdo.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.378
Yeah, like I was saying
about the rebranding...

55:39.461 --> 55:43.465
um, you know, like the Marlboro man,
but this is "Uncle Sal."

55:43.549 --> 55:45.926
Sal-via? Get it?

55:46.009 --> 55:49.169
Dude, there's, like, a "Buffalo Bill went
to Costco" amount of lotion over here.

55:49.221 --> 55:52.641
- Pfft. Hey, the salvia's back here, so...
- Yeah, yeah.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.769
Oh! And what is this?

55:55.852 --> 55:58.105
This is an oil painting of you on a throne

55:58.188 --> 55:59.856
with money hanging out of your pockets

55:59.940 --> 56:02.109
and a bunch of tits
hovering around your head.

56:02.192 --> 56:04.653
Seems like he... he's a true artist
for real, but...

56:04.736 --> 56:06.029
that is weird, admittedly.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.282
- Salvia is this way, so...
- [Darren] Yeah, okay.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.284
So Josué is up here painting you and...

56:11.368 --> 56:15.789
beating off to a porno parody
of your favorite childhood movie, Flubber?

56:15.872 --> 56:17.791
<i>"Flubbher." That's funny. [chuckles]</i>

56:17.874 --> 56:19.126
- [Joel] Hmm.
- [Darren] Hmm.

56:19.209 --> 56:20.419
Huh.

56:22.629 --> 56:26.174
Fine! Yes, I live here, okay?
I jerk off up here. I paint myself here.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.885
I jerk off while painting myself.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

56:28.969 --> 56:30.470
- Jesus Christ.
- This isn't that bad.

56:30.554 --> 56:31.722
I'm saving up all the money,

56:31.805 --> 56:33.807
so I'm gonna buy a Maybach
in like six years.

56:33.890 --> 56:36.768
I'm an adult homeless man
stuck in a balling-ass body,

56:36.852 --> 56:38.604
but I put my pride aside

56:38.687 --> 56:40.814
and took you to my grow house
to save the fucking day.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.567
- So you're welcome.
- Well, it's a grow closet at best,

56:43.650 --> 56:46.612
but it's definitely enough salvia
to hotbox the whole conference room.

56:46.695 --> 56:49.656
I mean, we can knock them on their asses,
take their weapons, lock them in.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.992
- We could kill 'em.
- No, not kill them.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.952
What do you mean?
You guys already got a kill.

56:54.036 --> 56:57.372
I haven't gotten a kill yet, so it's...
it's kind of fair that I'd get one.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.790
You can have my kill.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.500
I don't want your kill. I want my own.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.711
Look... I like this plan.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.173
Cool, good. We gotta figure out how to get
the smoke into the conference room.

57:06.256 --> 57:08.467
I'm thinking the maintenance breezeway.
The vents there?

57:08.550 --> 57:09.885
If we can go in the ducts...

57:09.968 --> 57:11.511
No, I don't... I can't.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.013
Figure it out. Look at all this.

57:13.096 --> 57:14.681
- Build something, man.
- I mean,

57:14.765 --> 57:16.350
there's a ton of lotion.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.645
What, we should just jerk the goons off
into submission?

57:19.728 --> 57:21.104
Just build something, man!

57:21.188 --> 57:23.268
This is a trash heap.
There's nothing I can use here.

57:23.315 --> 57:25.150
Yeah, this is all my belongings, so...

57:27.235 --> 57:28.445
Hold on.

57:28.528 --> 57:31.990
I got it. I got it! I'll draw it up
so you know what I'm talking about.

57:32.074 --> 57:34.326
Oh, the wheels are turning!

57:34.409 --> 57:36.244
All right. So what do I get to do?

57:36.328 --> 57:38.163
You? Oh, nothing.

57:38.246 --> 57:40.999
You just stay out of the way.
Okay? You've done enough.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.087
[Ahmad] On your feet!

57:45.170 --> 57:46.463
On your feet now!

57:47.005 --> 57:49.174
[Lil Puma barking]

57:49.257 --> 57:50.968
- [Bey] Ooh, tough guy.
- [Ahmad] Shut up.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.219
[growling]

57:52.302 --> 57:53.887
- Shut up!
- [Bey] Yeah, you smell bad.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.098
What, did you shit in your pants? [grunts]

57:56.556 --> 57:57.891
Shit.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.810
Wow, wow. You think I'm scared of you

57:59.893 --> 58:02.729
'cause you got a gun in my face? Fuck off.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.523
Bet you think you're gonna buy respect

58:04.606 --> 58:06.209
- with all that money too, huh?
- [whines]

58:06.233 --> 58:08.068
Well, it bought you respect.

58:08.151 --> 58:11.363
What, you think these people like you
because they follow you online?

58:12.656 --> 58:14.741
You know, half his followers are bots.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.827
Okay? He's not as famous as you think.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.830
Yo, point is, I blow their fucking minds.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.999
All you do is hate and take.

58:23.291 --> 58:27.129
Well, um... why don't we...

58:27.212 --> 58:29.840
"blow their minds" now?

58:30.549 --> 58:32.843
[clears throat, inhales deeply]

58:32.926 --> 58:34.219
You there. Bring him over here.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.972
I didn't do anything. What's going on?

58:37.055 --> 58:40.142
Oh, no, no. [stammers] Jesus... oh, God.

58:40.225 --> 58:41.351
Please don't hurt me.

58:41.435 --> 58:44.104
My intentions are to do
quite the opposite.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.774
Strip his pants. Bend him over the table.

58:47.858 --> 58:50.027
No. [softly] What the fuck?

58:50.569 --> 58:51.903
What...? No.

58:53.572 --> 58:54.572
Oh, Jesus.

58:55.866 --> 58:56.866
Let me up.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.827
You made me eat that...

59:00.579 --> 59:03.999
[breath quavering] ...hooker ass.

59:04.082 --> 59:05.459
[chuckling] Yeah.

59:06.585 --> 59:09.504
Now let's see you muster any respect

59:09.588 --> 59:13.759
after you toss this fat fuck's salad.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.594
Whoa, whoa. Ahmad! Ahmad.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.055
Whoa, it's so dark.

59:18.138 --> 59:20.640
Do it, or he's a dead man.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.310
All right, I just wanna say
one thing, dog.

59:24.561 --> 59:25.687
Didn't have to be this way.

59:28.273 --> 59:29.274
[man] Oh!

59:29.357 --> 59:31.151
[people groaning]

59:31.234 --> 59:34.613
[man moaning and giggling]

59:34.696 --> 59:35.822
Stop...

59:36.907 --> 59:40.202
What the fuck? Ooh, what the fuck?

59:40.285 --> 59:44.873
- [Bey] Yeah.
- [man] Ooh. Wait... wait, okay.

59:44.956 --> 59:46.625
Whoa. Are you guys seeing this?

59:46.708 --> 59:49.211
- Do you see this? Bey's eating my ass.
- [laughter]

59:49.294 --> 59:53.090
[laughing]
I'm getting my salad tossed by Bey!

59:53.173 --> 59:54.841
Someone 'Gram this!

59:54.925 --> 59:57.511
- Right, enough...
- I'm not done, motherfucker!

59:57.594 --> 59:58.720
[moans loudly]

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.013
[all cheering]

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.307
All right, stop it! Get him up. Up.
Enough, enough!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.351
Just a little bit longer.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.353
[Bey] What happened?

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.979
You tried to embarrass me?

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.439
I done fucked 10,000 women.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.234
You don't think I ate a grip
of dude-booties along the way?

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.527
[people cheering]

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.611
Yeah-yeah!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.864
You may not be able
to feel embarrassment. I get it.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.534
But prepare to feel suffering.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.785
[growls]

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.539
- [growling]
- Let's try this again.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:29.042
Bring me the correct
corresponding breach sensor.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.295
[Lil Puma whining]

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.343
[sarcastically] Oh, I-I hope he can swim.
Ah! Oh!

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.387
- What...
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.764
- What the fuck, man?
- Squat.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.474
- [grunts]
- Okay.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.810
These. We know what these do.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.895
- No. Ahmad, Ahmad...
- Yeah.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.023
[Ahmad] Oh, oh. [gasping sarcastically]
Oh, is that... yeah.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.489
- Lower.
- [panting]

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.949
[scoffs] Lower.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.616
Perfect.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.912
Fuck, they got Chet!

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.583
How the fuck is that possible?
They're fuckin' waiters.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.462
Weren't you just

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:18.466
a fucking garbageman a few years ago?

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.307
This way.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.020
I don't really appreciate you putting
my résumé in the street like that.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.813
Tell me you were driving

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.732
- the fucking truck.
- Fuck you, man.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.365
- That should do it.
- Good.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.117
All right, so we patch into the air duct.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.536
We hit the switch. We wait 30, 45 seconds.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.080
Until the bad guys pass out.
We zip tie them, take their guns,

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.958
and free the hostages.
I know. It's my plan.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.044
Okay, cool. You can have a sticker
or something.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.689
- What are you doing? Come on.
- Sorry.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.256
[sighs] All right, pick a gun.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.884
No, no. I am not using a gun.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.303
All right? My brain is my weapon.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.013
And it is fully loaded, sir.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.641
Okay, fine. Then you wheel the cart.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.352
What did I say?
Please don't do that, okay? Just...

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.479
grab the extension cord.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.397
Let's go.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.024
[exhales]

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.632
- You feeling tired yet?
- Fuck you.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.801
You're like the worst Bond villain ever.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.719
You might as well just kill me, 'cause...

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.138
[sighs] ...I ain't gettin' tired.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.183
[Ahmad] Well, Lil Puma
looks kind of tuckered out.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.852
Maybe we should put him out of his misery.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.407
[collar beeping]

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:14.457
[dramatic music playing]

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:23.550
[muted screams]

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.553
Wowee!

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.347
Now, that... that was fun. Oh, God.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.557
Take respect.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.850
- Don't ask.
- [Ahmed] Yeah!

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.435
- Take.
- Oh!

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.645
Did you see all the fuckin' blood
in that water?

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:39.399
How much blood was in that dog?
It's like a fuckin' bloodhound!

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.482
All right, mister!

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:44.654
I think we have all had just about enough!
Right?

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.615
Your treatment of our hotel guest
is unacceptable,

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:51.036
not to mention your complete
and utter disregard for hotel property!

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.079
And you killed the little rat puppy!

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:57.042
As acting manager of the Level Hotel,
I am telling you,

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.793
this ends now!

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.087
[inhales sharply] Oh, God.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.175
Just... There you are.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.343
That's better.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.304
Look at the time.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.767
It appears the U.S. government
doesn't care about you.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.187
In 60 seconds, someone will die.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.774
But, uh, I think I'm done with killing.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.694
For a little while, at least, um...

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:28.615
[woman] Don't talk.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.076
- [Ahmed] You.
- Oh, shit.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.159
No. Babe.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.120
Do something. Volunteer as tribute.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:35.204
- Do something!
- Up.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.915
Do something! Oh, God. Okay.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.625
[Ahmad] And...

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.088
No way. You.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.798
Cut them free, please.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.881
Step forward.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:48.885
[exhales]

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.181
[clears throat]

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.557
Now...

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:55.767
fight to the death.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.187
What? No.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.273
I'm sending this... [clears throat] Oh!

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.234
...to the news next.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.320
- Look, I'm not killing her.
- Okay.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.323
One of you kill the other...
or I shoot you both.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.869
<i>Look, anybody who can see this,
I don't wanna do this!</i>

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:17.330
<i>I am not a murderer!</i>

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.873
[woman] You got that right!

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.937
- Christ.
- [woman] Shit, I killed him.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:23.837
<i>J-Joel...</i>

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.172
<i>Now, that's what I call television.</i>

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.632
<i>But let's not do it again.</i>

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.676
<i>Bring me my money, my helicopter.</i>

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.929
- Did they put the money together yet?
- Just now.

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.556
Tell 'em to get the chopper up now.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.473
Yes, sir.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.599
[tape crinkles]

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.394
Hey, dude. Keep it down.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.275
[tape stretches]

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.115
Hey. Hurry the fuck up.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.033
Okay, do you want me to be fast or quiet?

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.952
'Cause that guy's about to kill somebody.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.121
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:03.710
[tense music playing]

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.798
Come on, come on, move it.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:26.524
[gun clicking]

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.234
It was just working. Oop.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:29.918
You're gonna die so fast compared to me.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.905
Okay. It's ready.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.616
- I got the torch. Need a lighter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.534
Okay, just hand it to me. All right.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:37.994
And, uh, plug in the fan.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.288
- Hurry!
- I'm going to. Where's the extension cord?

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.916
Oh, was I supposed to bring that?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.709
Yeah, I said bring it.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.588
Yeah, well, you also said
you didn't need my help.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.716
Then you cut me out of the Skintendo.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.427
So, I don't know,
I guess I was just a little confused.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.057
- Alexxx, no.
- Dude.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.768
Please do not be a complete piece of shit

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.686
and tell me you brought
that extension cord.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.896
Mm-mm-mm.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.149
You're playing games because
we wouldn't let you be in charge?

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:10.461
- [Darren huffs]
- Dude, those people are counting on us.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:13.321
Forget it. It's fine. Just... you're gonna
have to build a longer tube,

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.239
some kind of conduit.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:25.472
Hey... that promotion is yours.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:27.140
- Really?
- You earned it.

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:30.018
- Yes.
- Now put my pecker on ice, huh?

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.228
Wow, what a night, boys.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.106
I have been crawling around this hotel
for hours.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.691
- Ooh.
- You know what, Mitch?

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.859
- Huh?
- I have a better idea.

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:41.613
How's about I call corporate
and tell them what a disgusting

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:46.284
excuse for a man you are
and demand that you be fired immediately?

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.455
No, not because I want your job
or a promotion.

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:54.876
Because I want you to know
that if you behave like a pig,

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.962
you deserve to get stuck like one.

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:04.136
- Wow!
- Sixty-one yards.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.431
New Mexico High School state record,
boy or girl.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.683
[stammering] I'll make it up.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.519
Let me just get my head together,
and we'll talk about it, all right?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.354
Hey!

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.940
Somebody get my dick for me there, huh?
A little help?

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.317
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:22.487
- Where's Erma?
- She's gone.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.030
What, you didn't grab any money?

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.114
No, I just want...

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.157
[groans]

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.659
Get this thing in the air already.

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:30.829
Okay, but I haven't actually
technically flown this type of...

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.497
Alan, helicopter, air, now!

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.458
I'm not the one that shot the pilot!

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.477
- Hey!
- Wait!

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:57.481
Why are their pockets inside out?
Why are their pockets inside out?!

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:00.692
We're the waiters from before!

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:02.319
We want to buy the Bey back!

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:05.155
Please, we got all your money, look!
You can have it all!

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:08.575
We just want the Bey!

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:11.453
If I give you the Bey,
they shoot me out of the sky.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:15.081
We brought an empty bag!
The Bey can just climb inside!

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:15.999
What?

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.919
They'll never know
that he left the helicopter,

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.545
and you get all your money!

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:23.965
Okay! Hurry!

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:27.886
[Bey] Goddamn.

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.554
Get in. Come on.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:31.890
Look, I'm saving you, dude.
I'm saving you.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.058
Shut the fuck up.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.186
[Bey] You fucking asshole!

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:37.729
I will fucking kill you, dog!

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:40.357
- Don't you fucking close that...
- Let's get him out of here.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:43.193
- All right, you got all the money.
- Right.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.756
Thanks. You're not gonna regret this.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.197
- Let's make sure of that.
- [gunshot]

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.490
Oh!

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.493
[Joel] Jesus.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.955
- Get rid of him.
- Goddamn it.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.208
Alan, let's go.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:02.337
[Darren] Open it up!

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.007
Come on, open it.

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:07.759
- [screaming]
- [Joel] He's alive.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.761
- [Bey] Oh, my God! Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.596
Fuck, that motherfucker shot me!

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.974
I can't believe he's getting away
with this shit!

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:16.434
He's not. Watch this shit.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.185
Cassie.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.438
Time to let the dogs out.

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.524
Over. You gotta say "over."

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.443
Okay, everybody, that's it!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.987
Let's go!

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:29.948

No.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.214
No!

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.885
- [all screaming]
- It worked!

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.887
- [laughter]
- He fucking blew up.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.682
Yes!
Oh, man. It's kind of fun being badass.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.892
Yeah, yeah, it is, uh, pretty exciting.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:29:58.977
[laughter]

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.688
- I told you guys.
- You did.

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:03.982
You did, man. I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:05.817
[exhales]

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.486
- Get me to a fucking hospital!
- Yep, okay.

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:09.570
[Bey] Dumb fucks!

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.662
[Alexxx] Okay, so, you know,

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.956
we'll start working
on the Skintendo Joysuit right away

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.291
and then keep you in the loop.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.251
Yeah, and we are going to need
another check.

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:24.169
Yeah.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.052
Our lives are in a pretty bad place
right now,

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:28.049
and that check is gonna
change our lives forever.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:30.771
Fuck are you talking about?
I'm not writing you guys another check.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.636
[Alexxx] Hold on. Wait one second.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.221
Why aren't you gonna...
Oh, he's concussed, right?

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:38.025
He's got something up with his brain?
Is it jiggling around in there?

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:41.519
Bitch, the only reason I wrote that check
was to piss off Ahmad,

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.981
'cause that shit made me laugh.
[chuckles]

01:30:45.065 --> 01:30:46.775
[spits, retches]

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:47.984
Oh, my tummy.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:50.945
Get me the fuck up out of here.

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:52.113
Come on.

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:54.824
And play with my balls.
Make sure my dick still works.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:57.708
I do not get that. He seemed like
such a stand-up guy on the Instagram.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.138
- He's an asshole.
- Piece of shit.

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.539
Excuse me.
Hey, guys, um, I'm Mark Cuban.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.667
I'm a friend of the Bey's.
I was up there tonight.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.127
- I saw you guys had that bodysuit thing.
- [Darren] Yeah.

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:07.253
Holy fuckin' shit!

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:10.590
Oh, yeah, yup, we're gettin' Shark Tanked.

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:13.468
Mark Cuban wants to buy
the Skintendo Joysuit!

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.595
Skintendo Joysuit?
That's what you named it?

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:17.681
- Yeah, I named it.
- [Alexxx] Good name, right?

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.350
That's bad. No.
I'm definitely not interested.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:25.105
However, what you just went through
tonight was pretty hard-core.

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:28.066
I'd like to buy your story,
turn it into a video game

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.651
starring you guys,

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:33.154
voiced over and visually modeled
after famous actors, of course.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:35.216
- I call Sean Astin.
- Mark-Paul Gosselaar, please!

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.617
Uh, Cara Delevingne. I don't know.

01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:39.141
- Whoever we can get.
- I don't know.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.389
- All right, guys.
- [Alexxx] Awesome. Thank you so much.

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:42.893
Oh, he even walks cool. Sick blanket.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.436
- See you, Marky Cubes.
- Ring-a-ling.

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:45.829
- Sweet.
- That was awesome!

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:46.960
[Darren] That's funny. Wow.

Shut... shut up.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.147
Shut up real quick.
I'm gonna make an announcement.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:08.732
Hey, look. Now, I know

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:13.570
we are the millionaire video game mavens
that chartered this Costa Rica cruise

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:15.822
for 100 of our closest friends, yes,

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:19.325
but I wanna congratulate you guys
for having...

01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:22.287
the best butt-cheeks in the business!

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.538
You guys are hot as fuck.

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.790
And shake 'em if you got 'em!

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.584
[Darren] Whoa!

01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:29.252
[all cheering]

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:31.421
Dinner bell's ringing.
Come and get it, boys.

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:35.884
- Come and get it, huh? [laughs]
- Joel, I am so proud of you, dude.

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.802
Not a day goes by that I miss

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:41.264
that shy, closeted bitch
that you once were, and I mean that.

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:43.516
- Thanks, man.
- And Darren?

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.160
I am beyond thrilled that you are
no longer a controlling asshole

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:49.147
who needs to smoke salvia just to get by.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.065
Haven't touched the stuff
since that night.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.525
- Good.
- You know that.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.235
[snorts, grunts] Yeah.

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:57.197
Just, uh, doing cocaine now, you know.
But for fun.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.823
- It's better for you.
- [laughs]

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.367
[laughs] Ah! This is the best, guys.

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.953
Look at us.
Rich beyond our wildest dreams.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:06.206
- Darren doing cocaine for fun.
- Shh.

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:09.292
Joel is, like, fricking wiggling
his dick around, just begging for cock.

01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:11.586
Hey, I'm not... I'm not begging yet.

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:12.587
[laughter]

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.590
Oh! Darren, tell Alexxx
about that video game idea.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:17.467
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:18.802

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:22.055
leprechauns... but they're tall.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.808
Oh, that is a clever twist.

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:29.729
No. Nope.
I'm not all about making money anymore.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.398
You know what I'm about? Best friends.
