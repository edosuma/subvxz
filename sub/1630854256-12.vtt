WEBVTT

00:06.907 --> 00:07.908
Agent Namazi,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.044
I'm ONI Inspector General
Akhil Ali.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.112
ONI! Stop!

00:13.013 --> 00:14.115
Thought maybe you
could use some help.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.349
This is how you help?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.550
By letting him crash into you?

00:16.650 --> 00:17.785
Does it look okay?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.353
<i>It's almost sundown.</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:21.021
Do you want to break fast
together?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.456
Yeah. I'd love that.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.791
Come on,
I know a place.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.126
You're a soldier.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.894
You always have been,
you always will be.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.429
What are you saying?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.730
I'm saying, when you're
ready to put that drink down,

00:29.830 --> 00:31.965
<i>I will find you a job, soldier,</i>

00:32.066 --> 00:34.435
<i>one befitting
who you really are.</i>

00:50.151 --> 00:51.452
Kensi?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.088
Kensi, you got to wake up.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.391
Kensi.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.493
Kensi, you got to get up!

00:59.593 --> 01:01.862
Kensi, come on!

01:04.465 --> 01:06.334
Come on!

01:06.434 --> 01:08.102
Kensi, you got to get up now!

01:08.202 --> 01:09.870
Come on.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.306
Kensi, wake up!

01:37.565 --> 01:39.700
This feels so very wrong.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.203
You know what to do, Fatima.
Establish your base.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.637
Are you sure
I'm not hurting her?

01:43.737 --> 01:44.705
It's not personal.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.240
Good.
Now drop your hips.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.142
Fire.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.811
Do what?
It's not personal.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.148
Beautiful.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.152
Yes. Beautiful.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.391
Okay, that's good for today.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.692
Great job, Fatima.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.394
Thanks, Jeremy.
It was an awesome class.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.430
Uh, by the way, congrats on
opening up the second location.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.265
I heard you guys are
blowing up over there.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.666
It's been crazy.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.368
We hired seven new instructors.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.470
Herbie's a man on a mission
right now to grow this company.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.806
Just don't forget to come back
and see us, okay?

02:18.906 --> 02:20.808
We love working with you guys.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.943
Your agency's the first
to give us a chance,

02:23.043 --> 02:24.445
so we won't forget that.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.548
Uh, what about me, Coach?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.016
How'd I do?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.518
You, uh...

02:30.618 --> 02:32.119
stopped making

02:32.220 --> 02:34.855
those weird squeaking sounds
whenever you were grabbed.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.993
So, how do you feel?

02:40.093 --> 02:41.595
I can't yet.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.897
My entire body is still numb,
even my teeth.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.066
Well, I'd say for
your first self-defense class,

02:46.166 --> 02:49.069
you did...
better than expected.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.038
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.040
Yeah. Keep it up and, uh,

02:53.140 --> 02:55.142
soon you'll be
taking down a fleeing suspect

02:55.243 --> 02:56.644
without breaking your nose.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.079
I deserve that.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.314
It was a nice morning,

03:00.414 --> 03:02.082
all things considered.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.652
Yeah, it was.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.620
We should do it again.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.589
I'd love to. Cool.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.992
But maybe next time, uh,
we can just go for a walk.

03:12.092 --> 03:15.729
I think I can do that.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.699
I have to go, uh...

03:18.799 --> 03:21.201
I guess I'll...
We should get dinner tonight.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.205
Unless your teeth aren't up
for it?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.074
Huh.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.643
Look at that,
feeling better already.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.379
I'll pick you up later.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.481
Great.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.687
<i>Can't do anything about it, G.</i>

03:39.787 --> 03:41.021
It's genetics.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.690
Still doesn't give you
the right to be a bully.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.157
How am I being a bully?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.759
I'm just using the seat
the way it was designed.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.361
Oh.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.162
So, now you're blaming your
bullying on a design flaw?

03:49.263 --> 03:50.398
That-That's interesting.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.132
Three seats, four armrests.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.568
One passenger is supposed
to get two armrests.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.003
Simple math.
Is finding things

03:56.103 --> 03:58.138
to complain about
also part of your genetics?

03:59.707 --> 04:02.042
Come on.
What's going on?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.813
It's my first time
leaving my dad alone.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.147
He's not gonna be alone.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.482
He's gonna be
with his caretaker.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.983
Constance.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.219
Right. You told me
that since she got there

04:12.320 --> 04:13.421
things have never been better.

04:13.521 --> 04:14.688
It's true.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.590
But I'm also close enough
to come home

04:16.690 --> 04:18.025
if anything happens.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.760
I can't do that
when I'm across the country.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.928
So take him with you.
I'm sure he'd like to see Aiden.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.563
That's out of the question.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.732
Okay, then
you just need to trust

04:24.832 --> 04:26.199
that everything is
gonna be okay.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.068
'Cause if you don't,
it's gonna drive you crazy,

04:28.168 --> 04:30.070
and then you're gonna drive
everyone else crazy.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.005
And then you're gonna
become your dad.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.141
Don't even joke about that.
I don't joke about the truth.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.377
It's not true.
I'm not turning into my father.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.545
All right, looks
like we have a case.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.213
Uh, follow me, Mr. Hanna.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.222
Hey, guys, what do we got?

04:49.323 --> 04:50.891
Well, we received
a call from ONI

04:50.991 --> 04:53.026
about a missing
Navy nuclear submariner.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.429
Lieutenant Zahra Mahmad
is assigned to a fleet

04:55.529 --> 04:58.432
anti-submarine warfare
training center in Point Loma,

04:58.532 --> 04:59.900
but she spent
the last two years

05:00.000 --> 05:02.302
at a defense contractor
in El Segundo.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.637
What's she been working on?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.272
Her team's been developing

05:05.373 --> 05:08.108
a new anti-detection technology
for the Navy's nuclear subs.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.978
Access to technology like that
can make you a target.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.346
When was the last time
someone saw her?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.714
According to her CO,

05:13.814 --> 05:15.449
she left early
yesterday afternoon

05:15.549 --> 05:16.650
for personal reasons.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.818
He realized last night

05:17.918 --> 05:19.152
she wasn't returning
any phone calls

05:19.252 --> 05:21.254
or texts, she didn't
check in the next day.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.590
Her phone was offline,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.525
so he figured
there was a problem.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.659
It's been less than 24 hours.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.660
There may be a legitimate reason

05:26.760 --> 05:28.261
why she's not responding.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.263
How do we know she's
actually missing?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.865
Well, we don't.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.435
But given her position
and access to classified intel,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.604
ONI is not taking any chances.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.106
Has anybody been over there
to check on her?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.141
LAPD did a welfare check
this morning at her home.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.275
She wasn't there.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.811
She does have family nearby.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.913
Her parents live in Northridge,
where she grew up.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.116
They own a restaurant
that serves Afghan cuisine,

05:49.216 --> 05:51.619
and the entire menu is in Dari.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
Has anyone notified
the family?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.655
Not that I can tell.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.689
All right,
Sam and I will go speak

05:55.789 --> 05:56.990
to her CO, see if we can...

05:57.090 --> 05:58.992
Actually, uh,
Admiral Kilbride is on his way

05:59.092 --> 06:00.461
to the boatshed
to talk to them now.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.063
Okay, then we'll, uh,
head over to her house.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.598
See if LAPD missed something.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.233
And, Fatima,
since you speak Dari,

06:06.333 --> 06:07.835
why don't you go with Kensi
and Deeks to talk to the family?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.369
Even if they don't
know where she is,

06:09.470 --> 06:10.704
they may know something
that could lead us to her.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.406
Yeah. Copy that.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.279
Thank you, Agent Castor.
I'll take it from here.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.848
You got it, Admiral.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.051
Captain Alonso.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.953
As you were.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.722
Vice Admiral Hunt speaks
very highly of you.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.759
The vice admiral is being kind.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.628
Vice Admiral Hunt is
many things.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.530
Kind is not one of them.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.398
I trust that

06:38.499 --> 06:42.002
the compliment is as genuine
as it is well-deserved.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.006
You don't seem to agree.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.877
I've never been good
with compliments, Admiral.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.545
Hmm.

06:51.645 --> 06:56.116
Well, those with childhoods
like yours often aren't.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.820
They never feel
quite deserving enough.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.822
You read my file.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.624
The thing
about compliments is,

07:03.724 --> 07:06.026
the more you embrace them,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.761
the more you start
to believe them.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.698
I've carried an edge with me
my whole life.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.866
It's what got me here.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.968
I won't allow it to be dulled.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.006
NCIS could use
a leader of your caliber.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.374
My understanding is,
OMS is gonna be

07:21.475 --> 07:23.343
looking for a new CO soon.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.346
Love to have you aboard.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.482
Thank you, Admiral.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.217
I'll consider that.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.854
Now tell me about
Lieutenant Mahmad.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.288
From what I read in her file,

07:35.388 --> 07:37.324
she's everything you'd want
in a subordinate.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.059
It's true.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.794
I've never seen someone perform

07:40.894 --> 07:42.462
at a level
like Lieutenant Mahmad.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.364
She's one of
the hardest workers

07:44.464 --> 07:46.033
I've ever been around.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.136
And yet suddenly
she has gone missing.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.971
Now,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.340
why do I get the feeling
that there is more to this

07:53.440 --> 07:54.808
than the Navy has let on?

07:56.343 --> 07:59.379
I now see why you and
Vice Admiral Hunt are so close.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.380
You two think alike.

08:03.450 --> 08:07.020
Last week Lieutenant Mahmad
was involved in a briefing

08:07.120 --> 08:08.956
on a top secret recon mission.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.525
And this is where you tell me

08:11.625 --> 08:14.662
that you are not authorized
to divulge the details

08:14.762 --> 08:16.029
of that mission.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.497
My hands are tied, Admiral.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.833
And this is where I tell you
to untie them.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.835
I will not have

08:21.935 --> 08:23.837
my team out there flying blind.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.106
That's how mistakes get made.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.709
All I can say...

08:28.809 --> 08:31.378
is that the Navy is prepared
to do whatever it takes

08:31.478 --> 08:34.314
to see this mission through
one way or another.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.752
I can read between lines, Captain,

08:38.852 --> 08:41.021
but I cannot read minds.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.660
If the mission
has been compromised,

08:46.760 --> 08:50.330
instead of sending in stealth
submarines to obtain the intel,

08:50.430 --> 08:54.902
it'll be SEAL Team TWO
sent into hostile territory.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.406
Just how hostile
are we talking about?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.445
Suicide mission.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.619
Your team has 12 hours
to find Lieutenant Mahmad,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.453
or that SEAL Team is going in.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.902
Garage is clear.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.070
No cameras either.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.139
No sign of forced entry
or any struggle.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.707
Yeah.
Well, if something
happened to Zahra,

09:33.807 --> 09:35.643
it doesn't look
like it happened here.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.779
We don't even know
if she came home yesterday.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.182
Aha.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.583
What is it?

09:44.384 --> 09:45.452
A safe.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.354
Warrant doesn't cover that.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.822
Yeah.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.959
Uhp.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.827
Rountree found
a Suspicious Activity Report

09:53.927 --> 09:56.429
filed in Zahra's
bank account yesterday.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.232
She cashed out over $20,000.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.136
When was the last time you made
a large transaction in cash?

10:03.236 --> 10:04.604
I haven't.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.273
Check, wire, credit card.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.274
Secure,

10:07.374 --> 10:08.942
easier to carry,

10:09.042 --> 10:10.410
easier to trace.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.479
So maybe
she wanted to disappear.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.648
$20,000 isn't gonna last forever.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.583
She'd have to figure out
a way to find more money.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.287
Well, maybe she's selling
military secrets?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.223
I think it's time
for Rountree to make a call

10:23.323 --> 10:26.126
and get that warrant expanded.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.328
What is that?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.997
Something smells amazing.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.799
Oh, I love Afghan food.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.901
Have you ever had it?
Evidently not like this.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.803
I am missing out.
Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.637
Mm. Start with the aushak,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.639
and then you got to get
the Kabuli pulao.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.508
Ooh, and the kebabs.
You have to try the kebabs.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.111
I mean, yes, please,
D) all the above.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.679
There's Zahra's mom.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.049
Hi. I am
Special Agent Kensi Blye.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.485
This is Investigator Deeks.
This is Special Agent Namazi.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.887
We're with NCIS.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
I'm wondering if we could
ask you a few questions.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.125
My apologies.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.794
My wife's cooking is... amazing.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.796
Her English, not so good.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.998
Huh. I got
the exact opposite problem.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.299
My wife's English...

11:06.399 --> 11:07.701
Cooking?

11:07.801 --> 11:10.070
I'm joking.
He knows I'm joking.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.304
My name is Ahmad.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.572
How can I help you?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.508
Uh, as I said, uh,
we are from NCIS.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.410
Uh, your daughter Zahra

11:17.510 --> 11:19.179
was reported missing
this morning.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.148
We were wondering
if you had any idea

11:21.248 --> 11:22.783
where she might be.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.087
When is the last time either
one of you had contact with her?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.756
Uh, Saturday.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.691
Uh, Zahra came over
to our house for dinner.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.361
Did you notice anything unusual
about her behavior?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.597
No. She was her normal self.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.033
Did she say anything
that may suggest

11:40.133 --> 11:40.968
she might be in trouble?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.602
No, no, nothing like that.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.872
She was happy.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.942
I'm sorry, just a,
just a few more questions.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.844
Zahra has a,
has a brother, yeah?

11:50.944 --> 11:53.246
Yes. He's, uh,
studying in London

11:53.346 --> 11:54.982
for his master's degree.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.116
Are they close?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.918
Yes, of course.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.653
We are all very close.
Family is everything to us.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.195
I'm sorry,
is there anyone else

12:08.295 --> 12:10.030
who could have
information about Zahra?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.002
Yeah.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.640
About 30 years ago,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.943
before the war
in Afghanistan,

12:23.043 --> 12:26.780
we were forced
from our homes by the Taliban.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.716
Our families fled
to Pakistan,

12:29.817 --> 12:32.619
but my wife and I
decided to come here

12:32.719 --> 12:34.487
to chase our dream

12:34.587 --> 12:36.957
of having a restaurant
in America

12:37.057 --> 12:38.992
and raising
our children

12:39.092 --> 12:42.195
where they would be safe
from violence.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.832
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.366
I know this is difficult.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.968
I really do.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.071
Zahra is our only daughter.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.708
Please find her
and bring her back home to us.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.947
Mina.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.921
There's something about Zahra's
brother they're not telling us.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.590
It was the way the mother
reacted when we asked about him.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.525
We didn't even
say his name.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.927
Does that mean
she can speak English?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.628
She definitely knew
what we were saying.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.997
Then why act like she didn't?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.498
Like, her daughter is missing.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.867
We're just trying to find her.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.802
I mean, it might have
nothing to do with Zahra.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.372
It's possible she just
doesn't trust us.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.606
And I get it.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.041
My parents were immigrants.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.542
They probably would've
done the same thing.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.611
It took me joining NCIS for them

13:31.711 --> 13:33.680
to finally trust
law enforcement.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.282
And they live in Beverly Hills.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.786
It's Kilbride.
He wants me back in Ops.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.788
Doesn't seem like he's
in a good mood either.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.857
Oh, that's just
baseline Kilbride.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.825
Like "resting Kilbride mood."

13:45.926 --> 13:47.660
You see what I, see
what I did right there?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.462
No, but unfortunately
I heard it.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.763
We should
definitely head back

13:50.864 --> 13:52.199
to Ops and dig
into Zahra's brother.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.767
See if what you're saying
is true for them, too.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.578
How's it going
over there?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.915
Fine.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.150
Need any help?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.684
I'm good.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.253
Okay.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.056
I'll just be over here.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.824
Hmm?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.860
You don't think I can crack
this safe, do you?

14:20.961 --> 14:23.931
I'm just hoping you have it open
by, you know, Christmas.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.966
That's something
your dad would say.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.634
I don't even know why I try.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.203
I don't either, but it's fun.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.007
Hmm.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.477
Insurance card,
vehicle registration,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.712
toll road transponder.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.481
All things
that should be in her car.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.984
Well, maybe she sold it
to free up more cash.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.219
Or maybe a friend borrowed it

14:46.319 --> 14:48.755
or it's in the shop.
You know what?

14:48.855 --> 14:51.158
I'll have Rountree
run a Kaleidoscope.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.993
Check out all the mechanics
and body shops,

14:53.093 --> 14:54.995
in case
she took it in.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.763
Who knows?
By the time he gets back to us,

14:56.863 --> 14:58.298
maybe you'll
even have the...

15:00.200 --> 15:01.634
You were saying?

15:02.936 --> 15:04.737
You want a trophy?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.541
Looks like a bunch of jewelry.
There's no cash.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.809
There's an old watch,

15:09.909 --> 15:11.478
a bunch of family heirlooms.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.846
All portable and sentimental.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.382
If she was trying to disappear,

15:15.482 --> 15:17.750
those are things
she would have taken with her.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.288
She definitely
would've taken this.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.923
Maybe she was kidnapped.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.692
Or she wants us
to think she was.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.094
Hey, guys.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.162
I just went through
Zahra's phone records.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.031
Mostly calls
from her family, but...

15:31.131 --> 15:32.632
she's been talking
to someone else.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.567
A guy named Ted Brown.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.404
I'm seeing daily calls
over the past seven months,

15:37.504 --> 15:39.272
including yesterday morning.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.440
Boyfriend?

15:40.540 --> 15:41.874
Kens and Deeks
would have told us

15:41.975 --> 15:43.176
if the parents had mentioned
a boyfriend.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.777
Well, maybe she
didn't want to tell

15:44.877 --> 15:46.213
her parents about it
until it got more serious.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.115
Or she knew they wouldn't
approve. I just found out

15:48.215 --> 15:50.750
that Ted has a sealed juvie
record and a ton of debt.

15:50.850 --> 15:54.154
Everything from credit cards
to high-interest student loans.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.324
If that's why she took out the
money, she may be helping him.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.393
Or he's extorting her.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.439
I just got my ass chewed

16:12.539 --> 16:14.507
by the Undersecretary
of the Navy.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.643
I don't like
getting my ass chewed.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.378
Makes it uncomfortable to sit.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.647
So tell me we have made
some progress

16:20.747 --> 16:22.682
in finding Lieutenant Mahmad.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.684
Well, we figured out
why no one's been

16:24.784 --> 16:26.653
able to locate her car.
It's 'cause it's been

16:26.753 --> 16:28.388
at a mechanic's shop
since last weekend.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.123
How's she getting around?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.491
The shop gave her a loaner.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.992
We ran the plates.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.861
The car pulled into a
parking structure downtown

16:34.961 --> 16:37.164
about three hours after
she left the bank yesterday.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.398
And where is it now?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.732
Still there. Callen and Sam

16:39.832 --> 16:41.234
are on their way
to check it out.
All right.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.070
What about this boyfriend?
Have we talked to him?

16:43.170 --> 16:45.205
Kensi and Deeks
just pulled up to his house.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.706
All right, we have got

16:46.806 --> 16:49.576
less than eight hours
to find Lieutenant Mahmad,

16:49.676 --> 16:52.045
and there's still
too much we don't know.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.546
Now, you get me
some answers

16:53.646 --> 16:56.015
before I have
nothing left to sit on.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.388
Yes, sir.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.623
You haven't said anything
since we left the restaurant.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.158
Still thinking
about Afghan food?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.894
No. I mean, yes, but that's
not what's bothering me.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.796
Okay, what is it?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.531
I just keep thinking
about what Fatima said,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.500
about her parents not
trusting law enforcement.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.503
They lived in one of the
wealthiest zip codes in America.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.438
And that's how they felt.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.307
Think about what Rosa's
gonna have to deal with.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.442
Yeah, but Rosa has us
to help her.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.043
Yeah, but we're not
always gonna be around.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.878
No, I know, but...

17:25.978 --> 17:28.014
all we can do is
prepare her as best we can,

17:28.115 --> 17:29.382
and then it's up to her.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.484
Kens?
Yep, I see it.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.785
Door's busted.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.687
That's not good.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.095
Kens?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.369
He's got a pulse.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.838
Rountree,
we need an ambulance now.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.541
Building manager said
no one reported

17:54.641 --> 17:56.576
seeing or hearing anything
suspicious yesterday.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.179
He's gonna try and get us
a copy of the security footage.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.780
What do you got?
Car's clean.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.216
Except for this.
Found this under the seat.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.152
"Roger. 8 Broad"?

18:05.252 --> 18:06.686
Roger could be a name.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.987
Someone she came
here to meet.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.522
"8 Broad" could be
8th and Broadway.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.790
That's only
a couple blocks from here.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.993
Well, let's see
what's near there.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
Here we go,
currency exchange

18:17.764 --> 18:19.166
near 8th and Broadway.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.100
So she brought $20,000
in cash to a business

18:21.201 --> 18:22.769
that is known
for being exploited

18:22.869 --> 18:24.671
by criminals to launder money?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.072
If someone named Roger
is working there,

18:26.173 --> 18:28.541
he's got some
explaining to do.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.114
And here I thought
getting you back in the saddle

18:35.215 --> 18:36.916
was gonna be
a good thing.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.718
I think I clean up
pretty well, Admiral.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.254
No, I wasn't talking
about the jacket and tie.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.822
Ooh.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.958
They call it kombucha.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.227
God bless you.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.261
It's supposed to clear up

18:48.361 --> 18:49.662
the bad bacteria in the gut.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.399
Isn't that
what prune juice is for?

18:52.499 --> 18:55.735
At least prune juice tastes
like something edible.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.871
This stuff tastes
like flavored battery acid.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.943
So how are things
at the Space Force?

19:04.043 --> 19:06.313
No one's shooting lasers
at Martians,

19:06.413 --> 19:08.315
if that's what you're asking.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.384
I got no complaints.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.486
Except for a
shorter title.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.522
Director of Warfare Integration

19:15.622 --> 19:17.524
at the Space
Systems Command

19:17.624 --> 19:19.492
doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.629
Yeah, just have 'em
call you "boss."

19:24.464 --> 19:26.633
Feels good to be alive again.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.136
They don't see
this or this.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.572
They see this.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.207
And this.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.944
Make sure they don't see that.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.183
So what's this all about?

19:44.984 --> 19:48.588
Did you get your security
clearance reinstated yet?

19:49.489 --> 19:50.857
As of last month.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.025
So why do I get
the feeling this visit

19:53.125 --> 19:55.595
wasn't to see
if I'm still sober?

19:57.129 --> 19:58.631
Well, um,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.199
because it isn't.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.035
I am running into roadblocks
with the Navy

20:03.135 --> 20:05.405
trying to get information
about a...

20:05.505 --> 20:06.973
top secret mission.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.175
And because I now have access

20:09.276 --> 20:12.445
to sensitive compartmented
information across

20:12.545 --> 20:13.646
all branches of the military...

20:13.746 --> 20:14.981
I know
that you don't owe me

20:15.081 --> 20:16.683
or your country any debt...

20:16.783 --> 20:18.751
You gonna keep blabbering
or are you gonna tell me

20:18.851 --> 20:21.020
what the hell you need me to do?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.423
Thanks.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.592
Hey, what'd the hospital say?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.093
Ted is in a coma.
It's touch and go.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.095
But they'll call us
if he wakes up.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.997
Is that his cell phone?
I think so.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.165
Found it under the couch, smashed.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.268
Obviously somebody didn't
want him using it.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.103
Well, hopefully
the SIM card is not destroyed

20:37.203 --> 20:39.306
and we can get a clue off of it.
Um, any witnesses?

20:39.406 --> 20:41.974
Um, just a crazy woman walking
around the neighborhood

20:42.074 --> 20:43.510
with a Howdy Doody puppet
on her hand,

20:43.610 --> 20:45.044
asking if she could
braid my hair.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.813
Okay, that is a lot to unpack.
That's what I said.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.648
On a positive note, though,
she did say there was

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
an SUV blocking her driveway yesterday.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.585
She reported it, so I'm having
Rountree track it down.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.053
Okay.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.788
So...

20:55.888 --> 20:57.957
tortured and left for dead.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.960
Yeah, this definitely
feels personal.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.763
Ted owed a lot of money.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.065
Maybe someone
called in that debt.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.067
That would explain
Zahra's cash withdrawal.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.236
Right? They hold Ted hostage.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.471
She pays for his release.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.340
Or he was tortured
to get to her.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.074
I mean, if somebody
wanted to find Zahra,

21:15.174 --> 21:16.909
what better way than to go
through her boyfriend?

21:17.009 --> 21:18.678
And for that,
he gets tied up and beaten

21:18.778 --> 21:20.447
to within an inch of his life.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.449
I mean, look,
it's obvious

21:22.549 --> 21:23.616
how much he loved her.

21:23.716 --> 21:24.684
He would do anything
to protect her.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.586
Even risk his own life.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.887
So I guess the question is,

21:27.987 --> 21:29.889
did they get what they came for?

21:34.327 --> 21:36.563
Fatima has the parking
garage security footage.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.598
She's going
through that now.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.733
What can I do you for, fellas?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.569
Roger?
Yeah.

21:42.669 --> 21:43.870
We're investigating

21:43.970 --> 21:45.572
the disappearance
of a naval lieutenant

21:45.672 --> 21:47.707
by the name
of Zahra Mahmad?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.342
She may have come
in here yesterday.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.310
Uh, never seen her before.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.946
You mind if we see
the security cameras?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.482
Oh, I don't got any.

21:55.582 --> 21:58.150
You know, Big Brother
and everything?
Ah.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.352
Mm-hmm.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.253
So that, uh...

22:01.354 --> 22:02.655
fake plant here...

22:02.755 --> 22:04.223
that's not a camera?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.725
I read that plants
reduce stress.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.893
Even the fake ones.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.628
Mm-hmm, let me guess.

22:08.728 --> 22:09.996
This just tells time?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.564
Well, punctuality is
the politeness of kings.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.932
Wow.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.434
And that owl that's

22:14.534 --> 22:16.168
just watching me?

22:17.036 --> 22:18.838
Got a mind of its own.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.408
I think there's something
on these cameras

22:21.508 --> 22:22.542
he doesn't want us to see.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.610
And I'm still wondering

22:23.710 --> 22:25.244
why Zahra passed
by a dozen

22:25.344 --> 22:26.813
currency exchanges
on her way here.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.682
What's so special
about this place?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.150
Customer service?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.885
No, I think it has something

22:32.985 --> 22:34.654
to do with the note
that we found in her car.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.323
You mean the one with
Roger's name on it?
That's the one.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.058
And the fact that her car is
still here, that would mean

22:39.158 --> 22:41.127
that Roger was the last person

22:41.227 --> 22:43.029
to see her
before she disappeared.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.330
All right,
hold on a second, fellas.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.765
That makes him
a potential accessory

22:45.865 --> 22:47.066
to the kidnapping
of a Navy officer.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.101
Okay, okay. I met with her.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.270
She came in about a week ago.
So what?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.872
What did she want?

22:54.173 --> 22:56.776
I have what you might call
a side hustle.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.478
For people who want
to send money overseas

22:58.578 --> 23:00.647
but don't want
Uncle Sam knowing about it.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.148
You're a hawala broker?

23:02.248 --> 23:03.883
You say that as if it's illegal.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.918
It is if you're not
licensed and registered.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.887
Or if you're not reporting
the income.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.022
Can we get back
to your line of questioning?

23:10.122 --> 23:12.224
Who'd she send it to?

23:12.324 --> 23:13.926
Well, that's the beauty
of hawala-- I don't get names.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.728
I only know it's someone
in Pakistan.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.063
How much did she give you?

23:17.163 --> 23:18.698
Nothing. She was supposed
to show up here

23:18.798 --> 23:21.000
yesterday with the money
but never made it.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.176
Hey, anything on the SUV
parked outside of Ted's house?

23:30.276 --> 23:32.479
Yes. Do you want
the good news first?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.581
I hate this game. Sure.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.149
I found the SUV.
It's a rental.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.051
Okay. Bad news?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.553
Can't trace the guy
who rented it.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.288
He used cash and a fake ID.

23:42.388 --> 23:45.091
What? What kind of car rental
agency accepts cash?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.126
The kind that rents SUVs
to criminals.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.962
Okay, so it's not really
good news, only bad news.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.764
Yeah, but these
guys aren't really

23:51.864 --> 23:53.332
giving us much
to go off of.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.635
I mean, all we know is
where they picked up the SUV.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.638
But they probably didn't drive
themselves to pick it up, right?

23:58.738 --> 24:00.072
They may have been
dropped off?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.174
I'm gonna check
with taxi companies

24:02.274 --> 24:03.810
and rideshare services
and see if they

24:03.910 --> 24:05.778
dropped any passengers there. Okay.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.017
Zahra has family in Pakistan.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.351
Maybe that's who she was
sending the money to.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.086
Except the kidnappers
got to her first.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.122
Must have followed her here.
Or knew she was coming.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.356
Hey, Callen, Sam?

24:17.456 --> 24:18.891
Looks like
Zahra's kidnappers are

24:18.991 --> 24:20.727
the same guys who got to Ted.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.128
They grabbed her right
after she parked, threw her

24:22.228 --> 24:23.696
into the SUV, and sped off.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.331
Did you get a look at 'em?

24:25.431 --> 24:27.366
Two guys and a driver
all wearing masks.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.836
These guys were fast,
efficient, and organized.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.704
Zahra didn't stand a chance.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.839
Sound like professionals.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.006
Whoever they are,

24:34.106 --> 24:35.474
they were well-armed

24:35.575 --> 24:37.209
when they took Zahra.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.424
So it looks like whoever beat up
Ted also kidnapped Zahra.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.993
Rountree's still working
on getting an ID.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.528
Damn it!

24:55.628 --> 24:57.363
Careful, you don't want
to <i>Pretty Woman</i> that thing.

24:58.297 --> 24:59.465
"Slippery little suckers."

24:59.566 --> 25:01.433
You want to give it a shot?
No, I don't.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.002
Okay, what a gentleman. Hey.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.671
Hey.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.873
Oh, you know what movie scene
this totally reminds me of?

25:10.242 --> 25:13.045
"Slippery little suckers."
Yes. I'm all about the classics.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.514
Hmm.
Didn't realize I was performing
for Siskel and Ebert.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.750
Don't hate the players,
hate the game.
That doesn't
even make any sense.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.151
Sweetheart, here,
why don't you try?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.519
Okay, fine, I will.
Good luck.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.689
Okay.
What do you have?

25:22.789 --> 25:24.857
So, I was finally able to get

25:24.957 --> 25:26.759
in touch
with Zahra's brother Omar.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.294
Who is in London at university?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.830
Not anymore. The school says
he dropped out last year.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.700
He's been living
in San Francisco ever since.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.467
Well, that is weird. You'd think
his parents would've mentioned

25:35.568 --> 25:36.569
that little nugget.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.537
Yeah, I don't think they know.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.472
Omar says he hasn't talked
to them in years.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.774
Okay, but his dad said

25:41.874 --> 25:43.542
that they are very close.
What happened?

25:43.643 --> 25:45.878
He wouldn't get into specifics,
but it's clear

25:45.978 --> 25:47.614
it all stems from their
different views on Islam.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.616
Now, the parents believe in

25:49.716 --> 25:51.951
a strict adherence
to the Koran, and any deviation

25:52.051 --> 25:54.621
from it is a violation
of Islamic law.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.422
Omar says he used
to be beaten as a kid

25:56.522 --> 25:58.124
for being "too Westernized."

25:58.224 --> 25:59.892
Okay, I think

25:59.992 --> 26:01.293
we need to go back
to the restaurant

26:01.393 --> 26:02.895
and talk to the parents.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.463
I'm gonna take Fatima with me
in case just the mother's there

26:04.563 --> 26:06.866
and she decides not
to speak English again.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.567
Do you mind staying behind
and digging into the parents?

26:08.668 --> 26:09.836
Copy that.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.804
Let me just get this, uh,

26:11.904 --> 26:13.706
SIM card out.
Yeah, no.

26:13.806 --> 26:14.874
How's that working out
for you?

26:14.974 --> 26:16.108
Yeah, that's not how you do it.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.644
I'm doing great.
Oh, no.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.711
I'm so sorry.
You guys, I'm doing
great. I'm fine.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.947
I don't need
your... yeah.

26:22.448 --> 26:23.816
I got...!
No, I don't have it.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.752
Yo! Weren't you
the last one to use

26:25.852 --> 26:27.519
that tiny flathead screwdriver?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.088
Huh?
Wait, what?

26:29.188 --> 26:30.322
Who's that?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.258
Meet your SUV renter.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.425
Muhammad Hasan.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.827
He's from Texas.
How'd you find him?

26:34.927 --> 26:36.328
Well, it's kind of a long story.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.496
Oh.
The rental agency

26:37.596 --> 26:38.931
didn't require
a credit card.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.933
But I was able to find
the rideshare vehicle

26:41.033 --> 26:43.703
he was dropped off in, and
they did require a credit card.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.271
Oh, that's good...
So guess what I did.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.073
No. TMI.
I went ahead and...

26:47.173 --> 26:48.340
Way TMI.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.308
Just what's the connection
between this guy

26:49.408 --> 26:50.643
and Ted and Zahra?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.645
Uh, I haven't
found one yet.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.946
Hmm.
Except religion.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.581
Tell me more.
All right, so...

26:55.682 --> 26:57.383
Zahra's Muslim,
and Hasan has been

26:57.483 --> 26:59.218
a member of an
ultra-conservative

26:59.318 --> 27:00.486
Islamic sect.

27:00.586 --> 27:01.921
I was able to trace
his email back

27:02.021 --> 27:04.556
to a series of online
message board posts.

27:04.657 --> 27:07.093
All of these were made
within the last year.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.228
So he broke off to form
an Islamist militia group

27:09.328 --> 27:10.763
with other members
of the sect.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.932
You think they're after
Zahra for the Navy intel?

27:13.032 --> 27:14.934
I think we have to assume
so until we learn otherwise.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.736
But, regardless, we need
to ID the other two men

27:16.836 --> 27:18.070
that are with him, so you
know what we should do?

27:18.170 --> 27:19.806
Put in a call
to the FBI office in Dallas

27:19.906 --> 27:21.140
and see if they can
tell us anything

27:21.240 --> 27:22.742
about these two guys
and/or the militia group.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.410
We need to hurry.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.546
Why?
Hasan's credit card was
used to book a round trip

27:27.646 --> 27:29.749
flight from Houston to L.A.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.251
He landed three days ago
and he's leaving tonight.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.386
So whatever
they came to do,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.588
they're finishing it today.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.862
Copy that.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.530
Looks like Zahra's kidnappers
may have ties

27:44.630 --> 27:46.432
to an Islamist militia group
in Texas.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.000
Well, it makes sense.
They're trained.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.468
Still not seeing the connection

27:49.568 --> 27:50.669
to her work with the Navy.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.571
I'm not sure that it is
or that it has

27:52.671 --> 27:54.140
any connection
to the recon mission.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.809
Your instincts
are spot-on, gentlemen.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.911
The mission is to obtain intel

27:59.011 --> 28:01.480
on Russian military activity
in the Arctic.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.783
The Navy believes
that Russia may be

28:03.883 --> 28:06.385
trying to stage nuclear weapons
across the region,

28:06.485 --> 28:08.354
and for obvious reasons

28:08.454 --> 28:10.622
they need to know
if that is true.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.158
And what was
Zahra's involvement?

28:12.258 --> 28:14.961
It was limited to discussions
of the capabilities

28:15.061 --> 28:17.496
of the anti-detection technology

28:17.596 --> 28:19.465
that her team came up with.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.800
She was never made aware

28:20.900 --> 28:22.434
of the details of the mission.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.471
So the militia group is after
her for some other reason.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.239
How did you find this out?

28:27.339 --> 28:29.776
How do I find anything out,
Agent Callen?

28:29.876 --> 28:32.378
Now, our case

28:32.478 --> 28:34.781
may not be the Navy's mission,
but our mission

28:34.881 --> 28:37.516
remains: get Lieutenant Mahmad

28:37.616 --> 28:39.151
back alive.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.386
Clock is ticking.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.921
Godspeed.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.095
Tell me you're having
better luck than we are.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.797
Well, I don't know about that,
but I just found out

28:50.897 --> 28:52.498
that Zahra's father booked
a hotel suite

28:52.598 --> 28:54.767
in Islamabad, Pakistan
for later this year.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.435
Evidently he's going
to some sort of wedding.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.404
Who's getting married?
I don't know.
I'm looking into that now.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.672
But it's somebody close
to a man named Bashir Khan.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.708
Because he is paying
for everything.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.543
Never heard of him.
Yeah, well, neither had I.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.045
I looked him up.
He owns the biggest

29:06.145 --> 29:08.080
farm equipment manufacturer
in Pakistan.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.817
Wait a minute,
this can't be right.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.551
The wedding invite has...

29:12.651 --> 29:14.553
Khan's son marrying Zahra.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.223
Well, I think when Ted wakes up,

29:17.323 --> 29:18.925
he may have a little something
to say about that.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.392
You think that's why
they tried to kill him?

29:20.492 --> 29:21.660
That he was in the way?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.195
You think that Khan is
behind all this?

29:24.530 --> 29:25.764
No.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.466
So what are you thinking?

29:27.566 --> 29:29.368
Zahra's Muslim.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.870
Ted's not.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.571
Under traditional
Islamic law,

29:32.671 --> 29:34.740
she can't marry him.
It's not allowed.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.742
But arranged marriages are.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.577
This could be the
parents' way of ensuring

29:38.677 --> 29:39.846
she marries a Muslim.

29:39.946 --> 29:40.913
They may have hired
the kidnappers

29:41.013 --> 29:42.381
to take her back to Pakistan.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.649
Except she wasn't on board

29:43.749 --> 29:44.884
with that plan
for some strange reason.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.819
I bet that's what
the money was for.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.120
Khan's a businessman.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.755
Zahra was trying
to buy her freedom.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.190
If she refused
the marriage,

29:51.290 --> 29:52.925
it could be seen
as dishonoring her family.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.527
They'd be shunned
by the whole community.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.795
Unless they restored
their honor.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.097
What,
are you kidding me?

29:58.197 --> 30:00.232
You, you think this is
an honor killing?

30:00.332 --> 30:01.868
As far as we know,
Zahra's still alive.

30:01.968 --> 30:02.935
But that could change if
we don't find her fast.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.170
Where are Fatima
and Kensi?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.238
They should be
at the restaurant.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.907
Whoa.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.909
Oh, my gosh.
What...?

30:10.009 --> 30:11.277
Give them the heads up
the parents may be

30:11.377 --> 30:12.578
in on this, tell 'em
we're on our way there.

30:12.678 --> 30:13.779
Absolutely,
I'm coming with you.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.614
No, you are not, Mr. Deeks.

30:15.714 --> 30:16.983
I need you there until I return.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.351
No, no, Admiral...
It's not a request.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.055
Hello?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.735
Rountree, we need
an ambulance now.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.570
Kensi, Fatima, be on alert.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.806
The parents may be involved.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.812
There might be
someone else here.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.348
Federal agents.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.883
Drop your weapon now.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.419
You first.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.789
<i>Uh, Callen, Sam?</i>

30:57.890 --> 30:59.025
What do you got,
Rountree?

30:59.125 --> 31:00.526
The FBI sent over a list

31:00.626 --> 31:01.928
of those militia group members.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.662
You know the guy who flew over
to kidnap Zahra,

31:03.762 --> 31:06.298
Muhammad Hasan? It's her cousin.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.534
You sure about that?
Yeah.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.769
And she's got two more cousins
in the same militia group.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.338
Were they on that flight?

31:12.438 --> 31:13.505
Trust me.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.807
You won't even get
one round off.

31:16.675 --> 31:17.843
Yes.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.112
I won't need to.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.749
Muhammad?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.090
It doesn't have to be like this.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.324
Kensi, Fatima,
we're ten minutes out.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.060
Damn it, they don't have
ten minutes!

31:36.662 --> 31:38.097
I won't ask again.

31:39.065 --> 31:41.467
Drop your weapons!
All right!

31:41.567 --> 31:43.235
Okay.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.870
Okay.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.446
What happened?
Kensi, Fatima, do you copy?

31:54.546 --> 31:55.681
Son of a bitch.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.516
Kensi!

32:11.497 --> 32:12.664
Go ahead, Rountree.

32:12.764 --> 32:13.966
So, I'm showing that the Audi

32:14.066 --> 32:16.268
is still parked at
the restaurant, but Kensi

32:16.368 --> 32:18.604
and Fatima's trackers went
offline about a mile from there.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.406
They're on the move.
Zahra's cousins must have

32:20.506 --> 32:22.308
found the trackers
and dumped them.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.342
Yo, this shouldn't
have happened.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.810
Hey, you're right, okay?

32:24.910 --> 32:26.845
But if we lose our heads
we're not gonna find them.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.082
Rountree,
which direction did they go?
Uh, south, towards the 10.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.751
And the 110...
also technically the 5.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.121
There's no way of knowing
where these guys are going.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.623
They're headed to wherever
they've been keeping Zahra.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.191
But we don't know where that is.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.793
I got something-- the cousins'
father, Zahra's uncle.

32:41.893 --> 32:44.530
He owns a junkyard business
in Pakistan.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.698
But he just bought two
locations in the U.S.,

32:46.798 --> 32:48.300
one in Wilmington,
near Long Beach.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.003
That's got to be it.
Send us the address. Done.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.771
Hold on.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.809
Come on, Kensi, wake up!

32:57.909 --> 32:59.145
Wake up!

33:16.162 --> 33:17.996
They got to be in that car.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.032
Then they don't have much time.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.433
Okay, okay.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.770
Guys, we're gonna get you
out of there.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.177
Callen!

33:31.277 --> 33:32.278
Damn it.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.645
No, Deeks!

33:35.381 --> 33:37.216
Mr. Deeks.
Not this time, Admiral.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.850
You'll never make it.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.021
But if Agents Callen
and Hanna

33:43.122 --> 33:44.756
are able to reach them,

33:44.856 --> 33:47.959
they will still need to find
a way to put that fire out.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.971
I only see two of 'em.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.907
The other one's got to be
with Zahra.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.109
There's got to be
a fire extinguisher

34:03.209 --> 34:04.410
around here somewhere.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.444
Okay, the main building
has a back entrance.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.545
There's a fire extinguisher

34:06.645 --> 34:08.214
right inside that door.

34:08.314 --> 34:09.515
That's around this corner.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.516
We got to go now.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.684
Cover me. Cover me.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.090
Jammed!

34:18.190 --> 34:19.258
Damn it!

34:19.358 --> 34:20.559
No, no!

34:27.999 --> 34:30.236
Fatima, Kensi,
you got to get out of there!

34:32.571 --> 34:33.739
Kensi?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.774
Kensi, wake up.
This car's about to blow.

34:36.975 --> 34:37.876
Come on.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.111
Oh, my God.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.783
It's at the gas tank.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.794
I see 'em! They're okay!

35:29.495 --> 35:30.696
Thank God.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.399
Don't thank him yet.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.001
That's Zahra.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.571
We can't let them get
to the SUV.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.939
As soon as he sees us,
he'll shoot us.

35:41.039 --> 35:43.141
Well, then we won't
let him see us.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.281
Get up!

35:49.381 --> 35:50.782
Hey!

35:50.882 --> 35:53.151
You're about to get
your ass kicked by a woman.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.599
Bitch.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.674
Zahra, you're okay.
We got you.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.376
You're okay, we got you.
Come on, come on.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.211
You're safe now.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.649
It's okay.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.887
<i>And they freakin' sent
a search party looking for me.</i>

36:28.987 --> 36:30.155
Ridiculous.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.224
After all that time,
where'd they find you?

36:32.324 --> 36:34.560
Walking out
of the latrine.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.828
And what'd you tell 'em?
The truth.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.597
It was the kombucha.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.335
I should get out of here.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.604
Otherwise...

36:45.704 --> 36:47.773
we'll end up in a bar.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.175
Those days are behind me.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.677
Listen, Colonel.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.314
I know what a risk you took
getting that information

36:55.414 --> 36:56.915
for me.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.117
It's not something
I take for granted.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.720
I only have something to risk

37:01.820 --> 37:04.122
because of you, Admiral.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.625
I got your back.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.360
Always.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.402
What do we know?

37:16.502 --> 37:17.769
Long Beach PD found texts

37:17.869 --> 37:19.505
between Lieutenant
Mahmad's cousins

37:19.605 --> 37:20.906
and her uncle in Pakistan.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.874
Looks like he was the one
pulling the strings.

37:22.974 --> 37:24.643
Her parents had nothing
to do with it. Wow.

37:24.743 --> 37:25.877
Hey.
Hey.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.145
Can we never do that again?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.381
Just shut up
and hold me, please.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.351
How is Zahra?

37:32.451 --> 37:34.453
A little shaken up,
but, uh, she'll be all right.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.854
She's at the hospital
with Ted.

37:35.954 --> 37:36.955
He's awake now
and expected to make

37:37.055 --> 37:38.223
a full recovery.
Good, good.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.359
I'm glad to hear that. Yeah.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.961
Finally news that's only good.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.997
What?

37:46.798 --> 37:49.034
Never mind.
I'm just gonna go finish up.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.637
Where is Fatima?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.572
What a day, huh?

37:53.672 --> 37:56.107
Yeah, it's definitely one
of those that'll stick with you.

37:56.207 --> 37:58.143
I just still can't get over
the fact that Zahra's own family

37:58.243 --> 38:00.145
tried to have her killed,
and for what?

38:00.245 --> 38:01.747
Because she wanted to be
with someone she loved

38:01.847 --> 38:04.015
instead of a complete
and total stranger?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.817
Yeah, and all
in the name of honor.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.419
No, that's not honor.
That's fear.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.321
Thought you might like to know,

38:09.421 --> 38:12.157
the recon mission went off
without a hitch.

38:12.257 --> 38:15.627
All indications are
that it was a success.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.363
So now that it's all over,

38:17.463 --> 38:20.065
you want to tell us
how you found out about it?

38:20.165 --> 38:22.834
I turned to an old friend.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.970
Hetty?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.506
I said friend.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.409
You want to,
want to unpack that?

38:30.509 --> 38:32.077
What is that?

38:32.177 --> 38:34.646
Oh, what, this? This is the,
the bane of my existence.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.615
The thorn in my flesh.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.384
The proverbial...

38:39.985 --> 38:41.820
You didn't get
the SIM card out either.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.188
I got the SIM card out.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.056
It was so badly damaged,
I could only read

38:45.156 --> 38:46.525
the last text
that Ted sent.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.193
Yeah, what'd it say?

38:49.160 --> 38:51.329
He told Zahra he loved her.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.966
Hmm.
Well...

38:55.066 --> 38:57.035
I don't mean to burst
the, uh, love bubble,

38:57.135 --> 38:59.137
but, uh, I'm really hungry.

38:59.237 --> 39:00.739
You want some
Afghan food?

39:00.839 --> 39:02.374
I would love some kebabs.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.542
In.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.076
Kebabs, and then can we go down

39:05.176 --> 39:06.812
the whole list of all
the things I can't describe

39:06.912 --> 39:08.914
but my belly wants them?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.894
I've spent

39:22.994 --> 39:25.431
a lot of time staring
out at this water,

39:25.531 --> 39:28.066
searching
for answers.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.437
Any tips?

39:31.537 --> 39:33.905
I'm coming up empty.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.444
You doing okay?

39:39.545 --> 39:41.312
Physically? Yeah.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.783
Emotionally, mentally
and spiritually?

39:45.951 --> 39:49.087
I don't know
how to answer that.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.123
Well, you don't need
to have the answers.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.060
Not right now.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.330
I just...

39:59.431 --> 40:01.967
I keep thinking about
all the women out there...

40:03.368 --> 40:06.404
...not allowed to make
their own life choices.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.339
What to wear.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.141
Who to marry.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.744
What they can and can't do
with their own bodies.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.249
Freedom of thought,
freedom of choice.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.953
It's terrifying
to some people.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.825
It's not fair.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.529
The world will never be fair.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.565
But it could be better.

40:36.201 --> 40:38.403
Good things are happening.

40:39.337 --> 40:42.073
Even though it doesn't
always feel like it.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.145
I just wish
they would happen faster.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.115
Progress is neither swift

40:50.215 --> 40:52.150
nor easy.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.023
I can come back.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.691
No, no, no, stay.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.426
I got an early flight.

41:01.527 --> 41:03.862
I need to pack.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.597
Give it time.

41:06.765 --> 41:09.167
The answers will come.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.213
Rough day?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.584
You could say that.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.599
There's always tomorrow.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.802
Yeah.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.137
I know.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.476
Do you still feel
like dinner?

41:51.577 --> 41:53.912
Yeah, yeah.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.246
Just, um...

41:55.346 --> 41:56.715
will you just
give me a minute?
Yeah.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.117
Take as long as you need.
