00:07.556 --> 00:09.468
My business associate, Bobby Leroux.

00:09.468 --> 00:13.056
Miss Mendoza, congratulations
on your opening tonight.

00:13.288 --> 00:14.639
It's a big night for you.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.321
That all you transporting? Liquor?

00:23.601 --> 00:25.321
<i>Pinche</i> judge is a snake.

00:25.345 --> 00:27.074
We need to know everything about.

00:27.098 --> 00:28.895
Let's put Chicho to follow him.

00:28.919 --> 00:29.952
What up, cuz?

00:29.976 --> 00:32.796
Your cousin and his buddy
gonna grab a few drinks.

00:32.798 --> 00:34.443
I don't know if I can ever make amends,

00:34.467 --> 00:36.864
but I... I would really sure like to try.

00:36.888 --> 00:38.837
I appreciate what you did for Tony,

00:38.861 --> 00:40.393
but I don't want you

00:40.417 --> 00:43.335
anywhere near me or my business.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.837
You puttin' it
to that boss lady of yours?

02:41.979 --> 02:43.094
Bye, Bobby.

03:55.621 --> 03:57.346
Damn Mexicans.

04:05.709 --> 04:07.995
Hey, Tony. Everything okay?

04:08.019 --> 04:09.697
Uh, yeah.

04:13.299 --> 04:15.553
I was just thinking about my mom.

04:15.882 --> 04:19.063
<i>Remember she used to play Luis Miguel</i>

04:19.065 --> 04:21.661
<i>really loud every morning
while she made breakfast?</i>

04:21.685 --> 04:23.254
Yeah.

04:23.278 --> 04:25.021
<i>Cafecito and Luis.</i>

04:26.536 --> 04:27.937
Her voice was really bad, though.

04:27.961 --> 04:29.540
<i>She sounded like a dying cat.</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:33.716
I miss you.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.020
I miss you too.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.084
What if we hang out tonight?

04:38.108 --> 04:39.525
What do you think?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.047
Yeah, that'd be great.

04:41.552 --> 04:42.659
See you later.

04:43.497 --> 04:45.961
Great. I'll see you later.

04:46.581 --> 04:47.927
Bye.

04:50.061 --> 04:51.138
Hi.

04:51.162 --> 04:53.226
Emergency at the tequila factory?

04:56.982 --> 04:58.745
It was my godson,

04:59.243 --> 05:02.284
and it's a distillery.

05:02.558 --> 05:03.960
Right.

05:05.332 --> 05:07.239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:08.789 --> 05:10.577
Your godson okay?

05:12.592 --> 05:13.547
Yeah.

05:15.215 --> 05:19.019
Well, I see that you're dressed
and ready to bounce.

05:20.698 --> 05:23.111
Doesn't the boss
get to make her own hours?

05:23.877 --> 05:26.680
You got time for breakfast, right?

05:29.890 --> 05:30.995
Good news.

05:32.739 --> 05:35.627
I want to take you
to my favorite brunch spot.

05:39.222 --> 05:40.601
It's 9:00 a.m.

05:42.112 --> 05:45.112
What the worst
that can happen at the factory?

05:52.898 --> 05:54.277
Y'all good?

05:58.728 --> 06:01.000
Okay, I hope you like it.

06:01.002 --> 06:03.197
This is my first time making
<i>huevos "rancher-Os."</i>

06:03.221 --> 06:04.215
Oh, wait. I forgot the best part.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.599
Ho on!

06:06.018 --> 06:08.059
You... you really shouldn't have.

06:08.394 --> 06:10.639
Stop. This is literally
the least I could do.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.553
Okay.

06:12.252 --> 06:13.385
Okay.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.200
Uh...

06:17.224 --> 06:19.015
Isis Tony having some?

06:19.039 --> 06:20.039
No, he was up all night again,

06:20.063 --> 06:21.846
so I'm letting him sleep in.

06:21.870 --> 06:24.179
You should try a bite
before it gets cold.

06:32.815 --> 06:35.382
Mmm! <i>Delicioso.</i>

06:35.410 --> 06:37.447
- You like it?
- Yeah. Could I get some water?

06:37.471 --> 06:39.105
Yeah, of course!

06:42.660 --> 06:45.869
Oh, you gotta make sure you give
me the recipe for this dish.

06:45.893 --> 06:48.069
Oh, okay. You know what?
Actually, there's enough for seconds,

06:48.093 --> 06:49.983
if you want.

06:50.976 --> 06:55.469
My... dad split when I was two.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.730
My mom worked, like, three jobs,

06:57.754 --> 07:00.181
so I used to spend a lot of time

07:00.205 --> 07:01.810
at my best friend's house.

07:02.829 --> 07:04.979
His dad was the drummer

07:05.003 --> 07:07.572
in this band the Baptist church.

07:08.498 --> 07:11.109
I used to go every Sunday
with his family.

07:13.924 --> 07:15.723
That's when I felt in love with music.

07:17.790 --> 07:20.165
I'm starting to like your city.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.348
Yeah.

07:24.114 --> 07:26.003
I'm starting to like you.

07:36.109 --> 07:37.390
Morning.

07:37.392 --> 07:39.336
Delivery for <i>Siete Gotas.</i>

07:39.360 --> 07:41.459
We don't have any deliveries scheduled.

07:42.082 --> 07:44.105
Not according to my dispatch.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.331

09:07.205 --> 09:09.576
The best memory...

09:09.600 --> 09:11.740
- dahlias.
- Mm.

09:11.742 --> 09:14.824
Culiacán has gorgeous dahlias fields.

09:14.848 --> 09:16.757
I used to love running around in them.

09:18.464 --> 09:20.464
Why would anyone ever leave that?

09:24.089 --> 09:25.696
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to pry.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.426
No. It's okay.

09:28.450 --> 09:31.751
Um, I think I left

09:31.775 --> 09:34.775
for the same reason everyone leaves:

09:34.799 --> 09:36.689
more opportunities,

09:37.656 --> 09:39.900
hope for a better life.

09:39.924 --> 09:41.889
Well, it seems you found it.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.343

12:33.586 --> 12:36.574
There's something else, Teresita.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.892
<i>Es una maldición,</i>

12:48.916 --> 12:50.572
a curse.

12:56.028 --> 12:57.836
It's a declaration of war.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.359
I called off the deal
with Dumas last night.

13:06.478 --> 13:09.441
I didn't expect him to want to go to war.

13:10.197 --> 13:12.115
But you couldn't predict
that something like this

13:12.139 --> 13:14.145
would happen, Teresita.

13:14.623 --> 13:16.161
We could go to the judge.

13:16.894 --> 13:18.152
No.

13:18.176 --> 13:20.027
We can't owe more to Lafayette.

13:20.051 --> 13:23.277
They hit us first.
I say we call in the cavalry.

13:23.279 --> 13:25.291
We pick a fight, nobody wins.

13:26.636 --> 13:29.516
Raul is introducing us
to a connection from Atlanta.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.040
- A buyer?
- More than that.

13:31.064 --> 13:32.149
If we make a deal with her,

13:32.173 --> 13:35.153
she can clear a path to the East Coast.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.497
We can't risk all that.

13:38.869 --> 13:41.312
We need to know everything about Dumas.

13:41.336 --> 13:44.385
<i>Jefa,</i> I can't get through
to Javier or Boaz.

13:45.351 --> 13:47.333
They're probably just drunk somewhere.

13:49.418 --> 13:52.526
When was the last me
anyone saw Javier or Boaz?

13:52.550 --> 13:55.346
Last night at the bar.

13:57.608 --> 13:58.809
Let's go.

14:04.958 --> 14:07.173
It'll be a state-of-the-art

14:07.197 --> 14:09.248
prison complex,

14:09.250 --> 14:12.711
bigger than Angola
and more self-sustaining.

14:12.735 --> 14:15.038
When we're up and running,
we'll save the state

14:15.062 --> 14:16.533
millions of dollars a year

14:16.557 --> 14:18.297
per inmate.

14:19.079 --> 14:21.837
What about
your environmental problems?

14:22.269 --> 14:25.434
We've run our own independent tests,

14:25.436 --> 14:30.989
which clearly show the soil
is free of any contaminants.

14:31.013 --> 14:33.217
We've prepared all the documentation

14:33.241 --> 14:35.223
for your review.

14:35.247 --> 14:37.575
We'll go through the paperwork
and get back to you.

14:37.599 --> 14:39.246
Much obliged, gentlemen.

14:45.537 --> 14:47.865
They'll be wanting
another bite at the apple.

14:47.889 --> 14:49.545
Well, thanks to the new partner

14:49.569 --> 14:51.982
in the tequila business,
we'll give it to them.

14:52.383 --> 14:54.669
Hell, we'll plant them an entire orchard.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.484
Once this prison's complete,

14:58.508 --> 15:01.640
we'll do a clean sweep of the city.

15:01.664 --> 15:04.271
Miss Mendoza and Dumas and all the rest

15:04.295 --> 15:06.455
of the riffraff in our city

15:06.479 --> 15:08.581
will forever after call this home.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.710
Oh, one more thing.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.826
Miss Mendoza had a man
following me this morning.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.093
I'd like to send her a little message,

15:19.117 --> 15:21.589
maybe teach her some manners.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.708
I bet this <i>pinche cabrón hasn't even seen</i>

15:26.732 --> 15:29.096
his <i>pi</i> in years.

15:29.488 --> 15:31.706
- Let's just leave him here.
<i>- No seas pendejo.</i>

15:31.730 --> 15:33.662
Teresa can't find out about this.

15:33.686 --> 15:35.309
We leave him here, he'll be found.

15:36.677 --> 15:37.552
If we throw him in the water,

15:37.576 --> 15:39.541
he'll get eaten by an alligator.

15:40.431 --> 15:42.104
Scientist of the swamp and shit, eh?

15:42.128 --> 15:44.101
<i>Andale. Get on it.</i>

15:49.965 --> 15:51.362
<i>Una.</i>

15:55.250 --> 15:59.743
<i>Una, dos, tres</i>

16:07.672 --> 16:09.672
_

16:10.015 --> 16:11.637
_

16:11.662 --> 16:12.931
...when you used to be that fat?

16:12.955 --> 16:14.806
We used to call you <i>Mazapán.</i>

16:17.334 --> 16:19.449
<i>Cállate. We gotta fix this shit.</i>

16:23.995 --> 16:25.532
<i>Chingados, ¿qué pasa, cabrón?</i>

16:25.556 --> 16:26.885
I'm deflating him!

16:32.783 --> 16:34.494
Shit. Hey! Hey!

16:36.116 --> 16:37.889
We already have two bodies on our hands.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.837
You brought me out here
to clean this shit up.

16:39.861 --> 16:41.392
I'm gonna clean this shit up!

16:45.205 --> 16:48.062
I went to Javier's apartment.
No one was there.

16:48.086 --> 16:50.882
Then I went to Boaz's hotel

16:50.906 --> 16:52.353
and the guy at the front desk

16:52.377 --> 16:53.865
said he never made it home.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.535
Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me.

16:55.559 --> 16:56.651
They didn't look too good.

16:57.502 --> 16:59.116
When was the last time you saw them?

16:59.140 --> 17:01.250
Uh, Javier sent me home.

17:01.274 --> 17:03.338
Said he'd close up.

17:03.340 --> 17:04.609
He must've been smashed,

17:04.634 --> 17:06.369
because he left the door unlocked.

17:06.394 --> 17:08.930
Mm, maybe George is right.

17:08.932 --> 17:10.772
They might be in the drunk tank.

17:11.377 --> 17:12.698
I'll make some calls.

17:12.722 --> 17:14.487
- Okay.
<i>- Venga.</i>

17:16.527 --> 17:18.519
Hey, they're big boys, okay?

17:18.542 --> 17:20.473
I'm sure they're all right.

17:28.707 --> 17:29.925
You believe in luck?

17:32.296 --> 17:35.133
Yeah, yeah, I used to feel that way,

17:36.309 --> 17:38.864
maybe 'cause my daddy was a gambler...

17:39.122 --> 17:40.837
a gambling addict, to be clear.

17:42.290 --> 17:43.709
Man, he lost

17:43.711 --> 17:45.633
everything we had

17:46.231 --> 17:47.901
more than once,

17:49.077 --> 17:51.415
until one day,

17:51.439 --> 17:53.217
luck shined on him

17:53.241 --> 17:57.015
and he won the biggest pot of his life,

17:57.946 --> 18:00.139
and he kept one chip for me.

18:02.888 --> 18:07.767
I mean, eventually
his luck ran out, but...

18:08.792 --> 18:11.262
I've been lucky every day
since I've had it.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.695
Take it.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.763
No.

18:18.603 --> 18:20.157
You keep it.

18:20.619 --> 18:22.434
I'm not giving it to you.

18:23.475 --> 18:26.279
It's... it's a loaner,

18:26.303 --> 18:27.993
so when your boys stumble back in here

18:28.017 --> 18:29.833
begging for Bloody Marys,

18:29.857 --> 18:31.496
You can give it back.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.747
Here.

18:38.924 --> 18:40.328
Thank you.

18:40.737 --> 18:42.435
I got you.

18:54.044 --> 18:55.917
No reception.

18:55.941 --> 18:58.144
<i>Pinche</i> birdman.

18:58.145 --> 19:02.745

19:02.761 --> 19:04.761

19:04.929 --> 19:06.188
<i>Ten.</i>

19:13.689 --> 19:14.589
Just stopped.

19:18.453 --> 19:19.820
No.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.879
Bullshit.

19:23.903 --> 19:25.417
I see the look in your eye.

19:27.371 --> 19:29.371
_

19:30.970 --> 19:34.161
Remember when Emilia
had me stop smoking weed?

19:34.765 --> 19:36.521
She was on that health kick.

19:37.771 --> 19:39.771
_

19:42.032 --> 19:43.916
She wanted me to quit eating meat.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.302
_

19:47.327 --> 19:48.643
I just saw him. Let's go.

19:50.307 --> 19:51.806
_

19:52.760 --> 19:54.465
Okay, <i>bien.</i>

19:57.403 --> 19:58.857
<i>Llámame Si escuchas algo, ¿sí?</i>

20:00.243 --> 20:01.699
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

20:01.723 --> 20:04.041
That was Boaz's number two in Sinaloa.

20:04.065 --> 20:06.224
No one's heard from him.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.443
Is has to be related
with the hit on the distillery.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.089
You think it was Dumas?

20:11.113 --> 20:13.382
Hey, you guys need to see something.

20:20.569 --> 20:24.608
Oh, the smell of bleach
is burning my nose.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.441
No, that's the thing.
The janitors didn't come today.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.510
- Someone cleaned up.
- Hey, yo.

20:30.534 --> 20:33.532
Look what I found
in the dumpster out back.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.675
Hope this ain't Javier's blood.

20:41.413 --> 20:42.699
Nothing.

20:42.724 --> 20:44.058
The last 24 hours

20:44.060 --> 20:46.118
of surveillance footage is just gone.

20:46.142 --> 20:47.565
What do you mean, gone?

20:47.567 --> 20:49.706
Wiped clean, just like the bathroom.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.444
It has to be Dumas.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.583
He took out Javier and Boaz off the board

20:53.607 --> 20:54.787
right before he hit the distillery.

20:54.811 --> 20:56.610
Makes sense, cleaned up

20:56.634 --> 20:58.059
to buy themselves some time.

20:58.061 --> 20:59.686
For all we know,
they might be already dead.

20:59.710 --> 21:01.699
No, it doesn't make sense.

21:02.455 --> 21:03.633
He could've killed our men

21:03.657 --> 21:06.259
at the distillery, but he didn't.

21:06.283 --> 21:08.019
Well, maybe Javier and Boaz
put up a fight.

21:08.043 --> 21:09.604
- Had no choice.
- Yeah.

21:10.652 --> 21:11.857
_

21:11.882 --> 21:13.543
Dumas.

21:14.803 --> 21:17.636
If he has them,
he'll trade them for product.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.826
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

21:19.851 --> 21:21.706
<i>He's not answering.</i>

21:23.558 --> 21:25.345
You should check on Tony.

21:26.479 --> 21:27.884
Take Manny for protection.

21:27.908 --> 21:29.360
On it.

21:32.281 --> 21:33.677

21:34.418 --> 21:36.181

Where you going, Casanova? Hey!

22:40.820 --> 22:41.969
Huh?

22:45.208 --> 22:46.313
You know what?

22:46.337 --> 22:47.684
You ain't Bobby.

22:47.708 --> 22:48.969
No shit.

Those aren't mine.

23:05.768 --> 23:07.172
Tiger man here

23:07.196 --> 23:09.423
was in a place he was not supposed to be.

23:09.447 --> 23:11.140
What the hell is wrong with you?

23:11.140 --> 23:12.689
- Where's Bobby?
- I don't know.

23:12.713 --> 23:14.386
You do, or he wouldn't be here.

23:14.410 --> 23:15.605
I'm not telling you shit.

23:15.629 --> 23:17.392
What about you, Cheetara?

23:18.225 --> 23:19.762
You got any thoughts?

23:19.786 --> 23:21.080
Mm.

23:24.753 --> 23:26.762
Bobby runs a poker game on Thursdays.

23:26.787 --> 23:28.007
Corner store on Roman Street.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.223
Asshole!

23:29.225 --> 23:30.552
Let's go.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.156
Hey, you're not gonna tell him, are you?

23:47.966 --> 23:49.606
What's Many doing here?

23:49.630 --> 23:52.048
He's here to keep an eye on you two.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.782
There's a problem.

23:59.961 --> 24:04.245
I want you to be able
to protect yourself... and Tony.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.362
How bad is it?

24:06.387 --> 24:08.125
We don't know yet.

24:09.553 --> 24:11.074
Keep it close.

24:12.283 --> 24:13.695
Okay.

24:26.236 --> 24:28.019
What happened?

24:28.043 --> 24:31.757
<i>No es nada. It's just caution.</i>

24:31.781 --> 24:34.150
- No one leaves the house.
<i>- Patrón.</i>

24:34.174 --> 24:35.974
Is Teresa okay?
She still coming over later?

24:35.998 --> 24:38.125
She's okay, but she's working.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.140
She's not making it tonight.

24:40.164 --> 24:41.820
Don't worry.

24:41.844 --> 24:43.381
She's fine.

24:43.405 --> 24:44.861
You always say that.

24:44.885 --> 24:47.068
The less you know, the better is for you.

24:47.070 --> 24:50.361
Yeah, because all this
is working out so good for me.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.946
Hey, whoa, Tony.

24:56.771 --> 24:58.401
Okay.

24:58.425 --> 25:00.307
I gotta go.

25:00.331 --> 25:01.784
One more thing.

25:02.499 --> 25:04.837
Burn this and spread the smoke
all over the house.

25:04.861 --> 25:06.794
Okay, now you're kind of freaking me out.

25:06.818 --> 25:08.253
Don't worry.

25:08.984 --> 25:11.001
I will never let anything happen to you.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.613
Come lock the gate behind me.

25:18.638 --> 25:19.999
Yeah, yeah, coming.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.043

<i>pinche Mazapán.</i>

26:16.976 --> 26:18.548

26:19.149 --> 26:21.016

26:21.040 --> 26:22.324
I can't think!

26:22.365 --> 26:23.785
_

26:24.515 --> 26:25.501
I took you in...

26:25.501 --> 26:27.501
_

26:27.919 --> 26:29.458
_

26:32.403 --> 26:34.403
_

26:35.551 --> 26:37.477
_

26:38.839 --> 26:40.905
Like when you killed your brother.

26:42.903 --> 26:44.643
When you got your own son killed.

26:44.683 --> 26:46.683
_

26:51.124 --> 26:52.227
_

26:52.957 --> 26:54.957
_

26:55.225 --> 26:57.225
_

27:03.960 --> 27:07.210
If I stayed in Mexico,
you would have killed me too.

27:09.674 --> 27:11.674
_

27:16.385 --> 27:18.385
_

27:20.535 --> 27:22.535
_

27:22.717 --> 27:24.717
_

27:33.093 --> 27:35.220
Man, this smoke is burning up my lungs

27:35.244 --> 27:38.302
Gonna go get some air. Watch me.

27:39.856 --> 27:42.293
I'm good.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.504
Uh, hey there, buddy.

27:49.086 --> 27:51.227
Oh, thank God, man. I...

27:51.251 --> 27:53.269
I'm looking for Bourbon Street, but...

27:53.293 --> 27:56.931
I'm about as lost
as a fart in a fan factory.

27:56.955 --> 27:58.744
You're on the wrong side of town.

27:58.768 --> 27:59.883
Oh, great.

27:59.907 --> 28:01.979
That... that sounds just like me.

28:02.003 --> 28:04.211
See, I got one of these GPS phones.

28:04.235 --> 28:05.861
Got map on it.
If you could just point it out,

28:05.885 --> 28:07.320
brother.

28:08.012 --> 28:10.850
I just need to know if it's this way

28:10.874 --> 28:12.295
or if it's that way.

28:15.032 --> 28:17.183
How about you and me take a little walk?

28:17.207 --> 28:18.744
Hmm?

28:18.768 --> 28:20.544
You don't even know what you're
getting into with this here.

28:24.373 --> 28:26.136
You're already in it, <i>cabrón.</i>

28:26.430 --> 28:28.102
Mind if I borrow that?

28:30.043 --> 28:31.596
<i>Andale.</i>

28:32.093 --> 28:33.967
Come on.

28:44.031 --> 28:46.839
Dumas took two of my men last night.

28:46.972 --> 28:48.401
I want them back.

28:48.838 --> 28:50.559
I don't know shit about that.

28:53.119 --> 28:54.738
Let's go.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.028
<i>Pinche cabrón.</i>

29:11.233 --> 29:13.091
Listen, <i>compadre.</i>

29:13.542 --> 29:15.337
Hot seat's no fun.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.297
Been there, done that.

29:17.573 --> 29:20.009
You just tell us where they are,

29:20.033 --> 29:21.485
and this all ends.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.330
You can keep hitting me.

29:25.728 --> 29:27.156
You're gonna get the same answer.

29:28.719 --> 29:29.930
I don't know shit

29:29.954 --> 29:31.584
about no kidnapping.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.019
but that just don't sound good.

29:43.844 --> 29:45.882
I swear to God,

I don't know a damn thing!

30:14.368 --> 30:15.616
Hey! Hey!

30:31.243 --> 30:34.040
Now what are we gonna do with him, eh?

30:34.040 --> 30:35.480
Alligators will get him.

30:36.318 --> 30:38.132
What, you think you're

30:38.156 --> 30:39.822

30:46.966 --> 30:48.704
Why are you here?

30:49.579 --> 30:51.663
We were kings in Mexico,

30:51.687 --> 30:54.458
and you gave all that up
to come work for Teresa,

30:55.071 --> 30:56.737
and now you got your head
so far up her ass,

30:56.761 --> 30:59.372
I can't tell where you start
and she ends.

31:00.098 --> 31:01.934
I didn't question that shit today.

31:02.606 --> 31:04.195
<i>No, hombre,</i> I helped your ass out

Oh, forgive me.

Oh. It's not that kind of visit.

Well, Teresa's not here.

33:09.337 --> 33:10.817
I know.

33:11.168 --> 33:12.721
I'm here to meet you.

33:13.872 --> 33:16.646
Uh, now, I-I didn't get your name.

33:17.426 --> 33:18.898
I didn't give it.

33:21.483 --> 33:22.762
I like you.

33:22.786 --> 33:24.122
Okay.

33:24.146 --> 33:26.306
Listen, I'm pretty busy,
so is there a message

33:26.330 --> 33:27.996
y'all would like me to give to Teresa?

33:28.020 --> 33:29.858
As a matter of fact,

33:30.747 --> 33:34.085
if Teresa want to know my secrets,

33:34.441 --> 33:36.204
then she should ask me.

33:36.873 --> 33:38.762
I'm an open book.

33:39.367 --> 33:42.726
Having me watched only leads to trouble.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.860
Hello, son.

33:45.885 --> 33:47.498
What's your name, young man?

33:48.819 --> 33:49.826
Tony.

33:49.850 --> 33:51.515
Tony.

33:51.539 --> 33:53.078
You Teresa's son?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.898
No, he's not, and it's time
for you guys to go, I think.

34:03.488 --> 34:05.935
Make sure you give her
that message for me.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.975
Enjoy your evening, miss.

34:19.123 --> 34:22.610
Don't worry! I know the way out.

34:24.616 --> 34:25.936
Who was that?

34:25.960 --> 34:27.290
I don't know, but something tells me

34:27.313 --> 34:28.693
it's the big bad wolf.

34:33.310 --> 34:34.664
Please pick up. Please pick up. Pick up.

34:41.853 --> 34:42.915
Please...

34:42.938 --> 34:46.172
No, you don't talk to her.

34:46.425 --> 34:47.840
You don't even look at her.

34:47.864 --> 34:49.217
Stop.

34:55.172 --> 34:57.092
I just want to find them.

34:58.157 --> 34:59.437
Will you help me?

35:04.510 --> 35:06.499
Can I get a drink?

35:14.143 --> 35:15.868
- Untie him.
- Teresa...

35:15.892 --> 35:17.002
Untie him.

35:36.455 --> 35:37.699
Thank you.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.391
Where are they?

35:53.265 --> 35:55.785
You gonna let me go if I tell you?

35:55.809 --> 35:57.093
Are they alive?

36:01.199 --> 36:04.077
Marcel isn't a killer by nature.

36:04.578 --> 36:06.273
He's a businessman.

36:07.325 --> 36:09.541
You just gotta know
how to speak his language.

36:11.264 --> 36:12.818
You're stalling.

36:13.131 --> 36:15.017
Agh

36:27.734 --> 36:29.734
He's losing a lot of blood.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.944
If he dies, we'll never
see Javier again.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.042
Ah, damn it!

36:35.066 --> 36:36.745
He needs a doctor.

36:38.552 --> 36:39.701
You gotta keep going.

36:40.568 --> 36:42.205
Ay, damn it.

36:42.403 --> 36:43.841
- What?
- Too late.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.217
Where's the car?

36:57.241 --> 36:59.005
Oh, shit.

37:02.523 --> 37:03.905
Hey.

37:03.929 --> 37:06.908
"Private property. No trespassing."

37:07.978 --> 37:09.978
_

37:36.142 --> 37:37.308
Hey.

37:38.406 --> 37:39.650
Can't sleep.

37:40.627 --> 37:42.306
You wanna come help me study?

37:43.719 --> 37:45.266
What are you studying?

37:45.290 --> 37:47.935
Uh, Louisiana law.

37:49.632 --> 37:51.397
I miss practicing,

37:51.421 --> 37:54.218
so hopefully I can get approval
from the state.

37:55.239 --> 37:56.503
When were you a lawyer?

37:57.026 --> 37:59.126
Right, well, I've lived

37:59.150 --> 38:01.039
many lives.

38:02.486 --> 38:04.593
You know, I've been to hell and back

38:04.617 --> 38:06.197
just in the last couple of years.

38:09.489 --> 38:11.347
Is that how you feel,

38:11.371 --> 38:13.639
kind of like you've been
to hell and back?

38:16.833 --> 38:19.052
You know, I keep having these nightmares.

38:22.460 --> 38:26.886
This guy comes in my room and shoots me.

38:30.309 --> 38:33.106
And it... it feel so real.

38:34.514 --> 38:36.615
It's like I could feel
the bullet going in my chest.

38:36.639 --> 38:38.396
Mm.

38:43.788 --> 38:46.063
You know...

38:46.693 --> 38:49.535
Sometimes life can get real dark.

38:51.356 --> 38:53.792
<i>And it gets kind of hard
to tell the difference</i>

38:53.816 --> 38:56.736
<i>between reality and a nightmare.</i>

38:58.538 --> 39:00.571
<i>You know, I have nightmares too.</i>

39:02.504 --> 39:06.367
I've been sober for six months,

39:06.391 --> 39:09.121
<i>and I keep dreaming that I relapse,</i>

39:09.769 --> 39:12.121
<i>and it feels very real.</i>

39:13.825 --> 39:15.868
<i>'Cause see, I got a second chance in life</i>

39:15.892 --> 39:17.689
<i>just like you did.</i>

39:19.107 --> 39:20.460
<i>But we're still trying to figure out</i>

39:20.462 --> 39:22.815
<i>how to run away from our past,</i>

39:22.839 --> 39:25.332
<i>and we'll do anything to do it.</i>

39:26.887 --> 39:28.458
<i>You close your eyes and envision</i>

39:28.482 --> 39:30.373
<i>somethin different,</i>

39:31.766 --> 39:33.725
<i>but then your eyes open</i>

39:33.750 --> 39:36.211
<i>and we're still stuck with ourselves.</i>

39:37.004 --> 39:38.779
<i>So every morning,</i>

39:38.961 --> 39:41.626
I wake up and I pray to my higher power

39:41.650 --> 39:45.553
for help to accept
the things I can't change

39:45.577 --> 39:48.600
and for courage to change
the things I can.

39:50.256 --> 39:52.548
You can't run away from your past, okay?

39:52.550 --> 39:53.935
It's a part of you.

39:55.153 --> 39:58.379
<i>But the darkness, the nightmares...</i>

39:58.403 --> 40:00.757
<i>you gotta lock that away,</i>

40:00.781 --> 40:02.755
<i>because it isn't real,</i>

40:03.495 --> 40:06.408
<i>and it's only gonna hurt us if we let it.</i>

40:35.045 --> 40:36.525
<i>Patrona.</i>
