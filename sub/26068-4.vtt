-No, I'm just saying...

18:39.200 --> 18:40.640

19:53.520 --> 19:56.400

-Great.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.680

22:33.240 --> 22:35.520

from <i>Home Alone.</i>

22:35.600 --> 22:36.440
Yes.

22:38.520 --> 22:44.200
And he gets stung by what is essentially
an entire hive-load of bees.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.800
And he's... he's allergic.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.560

And on the day of the funeral,
she ends up running in, right.

And it's an open casket which,
when you really think about it,

23:01.320 --> 23:04.080

23:04.160 --> 23:06.480
she runs in, she runs up
to <i>Home Alone's</i> casket

36:23.840 --> 36:27.040
You're saying you're taking us
off the raffle?

36:27.280 --> 36:29.200
-Yes.
-Because of these complaints?

36:29.600 --> 36:30.760
They're not complaints.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.800
Or whatever it is we're calling them.
The point is that we're no longer--

36:33.880 --> 36:36.440
How many of them are we talking?

36:36.760 --> 36:39.320
10, 11, 12.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.920
-Which is it?
-Is it 10 or 12?

36:42.400 --> 36:43.280
15.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.480
-15?
-15!

36:45.560 --> 36:47.760
-Who are these people?
-What are they pissed off about?

36:47.840 --> 36:50.000
More to the point, how do they know?

36:50.200 --> 36:57.120
They... these friends of ours, they
explained that they'd written to the...

36:57.960 --> 37:02.680
at their daughter's school
to express their concern.

37:02.840 --> 37:07.240
Anyway. Then they said
that the irony is, of course, that...

37:07.840 --> 37:11.360
his wife's a professional therapist.
That they ought to know better.

37:12.600 --> 37:17.560
-Janet, come on, this is--
-All right.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.080
I had to tell Mike.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.040
Fucking Mike!

37:24.120 --> 37:26.080
-Because originally...
-He was the one who saw us.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.640
-What did you tell him?
-The truth.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.800
-Why on earth?
-Mike is such a fucking ball-sack.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.800
I am in a position of responsibility.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.320
If a colleague-- If an employee,

37:36.400 --> 37:39.480
if they come to me and they say, "Janet!"

37:39.560 --> 37:42.120
Janet, no one has done anything wrong.

37:42.680 --> 37:46.120
It is not affecting the work,
we're fine with it.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.560
Both of you know as well as I do
this is a small town.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.120
Small-fucking-minded.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.840
Technically, it's a city.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.160
All I'm asking,
if not a little bit begging,

37:57.240 --> 38:00.120
is please, forget about the fundraiser.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.160
Put it out of your minds. Go and do
whatever it is the two of you--

38:05.760 --> 38:10.280
And then next week, fresh start,
we'll sit down, we three,

38:10.360 --> 38:12.480
we'll try to work out the best way to--

38:14.720 --> 38:15.600
All right?

38:16.440 --> 38:18.720
[James] <i>The real sticking point</i>
<i>for Elaine...</i>

38:22.920 --> 38:28.040
I suppose that she feels there is
a certain degree of hypocrisy.

38:31.440 --> 38:35.520
Trusting our marriage to someone whose own
marriage is so clearly in a state of...

38:37.440 --> 38:38.280
disarray.

38:40.880 --> 38:46.360
And it's funny because they know there is
a certain amount of infidelity involved.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.760
You know, every time I come to see you,
I see the same man leaving.

38:51.560 --> 38:56.160
But for that 50 minutes, that one hour
once or twice a week, whatever it is,

38:56.760 --> 39:02.240
we do our best to offer
complete and utter exclusivity.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.280
And when it works...

39:06.120 --> 39:07.440
But when it doesn't--

39:08.680 --> 39:09.640
When it doesn't...

39:12.920 --> 39:15.600
-It's the responsibility.
-Because it's all on you?

39:15.840 --> 39:19.000
I'm there to be whatever it is
that person needs me to be.

39:19.520 --> 39:22.600
So if something is not quite...

39:24.800 --> 39:27.640
-Clicking?
-Yes. Then it just feels so...

39:33.200 --> 39:35.200
Can you give me a particular example?

39:40.920 --> 39:43.680
He'd been unfaithful, repeatedly.

39:45.320 --> 39:49.440
They'd been trying for children
for a number of years and...

39:50.640 --> 39:51.680
And?

39:55.080 --> 39:58.640
I had a hard time liking him.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.040
I don't think he liked me.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.280
He had this way, it was quite...

40:10.120 --> 40:13.560
standoffish, brutish.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.720
-To you? Or in general?
-Bit of both, I think.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.480
And I really struggled. Now, why
isn't this working, why won't he...?

40:24.200 --> 40:27.560
And occasionally, I even found myself
dreading the prospect of...

40:33.600 --> 40:36.120
And one day, out of the blue, he...

40:45.320 --> 40:49.200
And this was after eight, nine months
working together.

Joy, I'm struck by something
you said a moment ago.

41:17.440 --> 41:23.360
You said, "It's my job to be
whoever it is they need me to be."

41:24.120 --> 41:29.040
In which case, I wonder if it's possible
to talk about

41:30.000 --> 41:32.880
a time where you've experienced feeling...

41:38.000 --> 41:38.920

-No.

-Please don't hate me.
-I'm not gonna hate you.

You know?

52:53.160 --> 52:54.800
Listen, no one--

52:54.880 --> 52:59.240
You do realize you might have
actually cost me my job.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.200
On what grounds?

53:03.000 --> 53:04.160
Joy, come on.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.720
You embarrassed me tonight.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.720
Tonight was embarrassing.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.680
And would you consider it more or less
of an embarrassment

53:12.760 --> 53:14.280
if we were just cheating on each other?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.440
If we decided to break up, get a divorce,
and cut the kids in half,

53:18.520 --> 53:20.640
and spend the weekends ferrying them
back and forth.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.120

53:23.200 --> 53:25.480
How about a whole string
of unsuccessful marriages?

53:25.560 --> 53:28.840
Would you consider <i>that </i>to be
more or less of an embarrassment?

53:28.920 --> 53:30.880
I mean, these people need
to grow the fuck up.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.720
[laughs]

53:32.800 --> 53:34.880
So they're the ones who need to grow up,
are they?

53:34.960 --> 53:36.400
-Yes.
-Oh, I see. I get it now.

53:36.480 --> 53:37.880
So <i>they're </i>the ones...

53:37.960 --> 53:40.800
-We have every right to live--
-Joy, listen to yourself!

53:40.880 --> 53:46.880
What you did tonight, it was...
it was wildly, wildly inappropriate.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.280
I disagree.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.120
Should never have let you
talk me into this.

53:53.360 --> 53:54.960
-Into what?
-Any of it.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.240
All of it.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.640
What's that supposed to mean?

53:58.720 --> 53:59.840
It means...

54:02.240 --> 54:05.360
It means I'm losing track of where
we're even at anymore.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.040

you're out bowling with your ex.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.080
And then you're up in front of--

54:12.160 --> 54:16.280
Alan, look, I think honestly you're
in danger of making a mountain into--

54:16.360 --> 54:19.400
Then why this persistent moving
of the goal posts?

54:19.480 --> 54:21.440
I'm not the one who fell in love, so...

54:22.280 --> 54:23.760
I beg your fucking pardon?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.600
-Mmm.
-Oh...

54:26.400 --> 54:29.280
Oh, I see, so this is all my fault now?

54:29.360 --> 54:32.320
-No, it's nobody's--
-Joy, I came to you and I told you.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.160
-Yeah, you did.
-And we agreed a way forward.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.000
-Which to my mind--
-Will you stop shouting at me?

54:38.720 --> 54:42.680
How can you not see, how is it not
apparent to you, that all I am doing...

54:45.120 --> 54:46.800
all I've been trying to do...

54:49.520 --> 54:50.960
is give you what you want.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.360
Is that right?

54:57.360 --> 54:59.960
I'm saying that it took...

55:03.440 --> 55:07.160
it took an enormous leap of faith
on my part, Joy, to make it this far.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.520
To make it work, to make a go of things.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.000
Fine then, if it's making you
that uncomfortable, let's stop.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.320
That isn't what I'm--

55:17.400 --> 55:20.680
If it's such a hardship,
life under the guilt-free sex cosh...

55:20.760 --> 55:23.520
-No, you're not listening to me.
-But it's a good point.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.120
You're right, it's a good point.
What would you do?

55:27.280 --> 55:29.240
If you had to-- If we had to stop?

55:32.520 --> 55:33.360
You're right.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.920
If you had to make a choice...

55:37.720 --> 55:38.800
who would you choose?

55:50.000 --> 55:53.160
I haven't met anyone who makes me feel
the way you feel about Claire.

56:00.480 --> 56:05.520
And I don't feel the way I feel about you
about anyone.

56:10.560 --> 56:14.240
And then again, nor have I ever quite
felt the way I feel about Claire

56:14.320 --> 56:15.160
about you.
