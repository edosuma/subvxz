00:55.633 --> 00:57.600
Well, I loved her.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.266
The name Madonna
doesn't really fit her.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.567
-"Slut" would be better.
-Sophia!

01:02.633 --> 01:05.133
Oh, please, please.
She did things on that stage

01:05.200 --> 01:06.633
I never did with my husband.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.066
Oh! Dorothy, what a thing to say!

01:11.133 --> 01:13.867
-(gasps) Oh!
-Oh, my!

01:13.934 --> 01:15.533
-It's a mess!
-I've been robbed!

01:16.033 --> 01:17.300
Oh, boy.

01:17.934 --> 01:20.333
Shh. Shh, be quiet!
They could still be here.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.567
-Who?
-The supreme court. Who?

01:23.700 --> 01:25.767
-The robbers.
-Is there more than one?

01:25.834 --> 01:27.934
-I don't know.
-You said "they."

01:28.000 --> 01:30.166
They, him, what difference
does it make?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.100
That's how they got in.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.767
Oh, oh, but wait,
they might still be here!

01:36.834 --> 01:38.834
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!

01:38.900 --> 01:40.033
Stay!

01:48.734 --> 01:51.533
This is a .375 magnum...

01:53.700 --> 01:57.133
one of the most powerful
handguns in the world.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.500
It could blow your head off.

02:00.133 --> 02:05.100
The only problem is I don't remember
if I shot four rounds or five.

02:05.633 --> 02:09.266
So you have to ask yourself,
do you feel lucky?

02:10.233 --> 02:12.633
Well, do ya... punk?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.133
Go ahead, make her day.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.433
-Wait, Sophia, where are you going?
-To my room.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.667
Well, you can't.
It could be dangerous!

02:22.734 --> 02:25.400
Please, I'm 80.
Bathtubs are dangerous!

02:26.300 --> 02:27.967
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

02:28.033 --> 02:31.100
They aren't here anymore.
Let's go check our rooms.

02:31.166 --> 02:34.667
Oh, I just thank God they didn't
take my Chinese vase.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.533
Oh, I'm gonna check the kitchen.
Wait, don't leave me!

02:38.600 --> 02:40.166
What'll I do if they come back?

02:40.233 --> 02:42.233
Show them your slides of Hawaii.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.600
I'm fine. I'm just fine.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.867
There's nothing to be afraid of.
These things happen every day.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.967
The main thing is, nobody was hurt.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.000
We could have been here.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.233
They could have come
in the middle of the night...

03:07.867 --> 03:08.934
while we slept.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.133
They could have crept up on us
and cut our throats!

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
-Now, look--
-Aah!

03:14.266 --> 03:16.533
What?
I thought you were the killers.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.600
Relax, relax. I called the police.
They stole my stole.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.033
-What?
-My mink stole.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.233
-Oh, no.
-Stan gave it to me.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.533
It was the only present
he ever gave me

03:28.600 --> 03:30.633
that didn't need an extension cord.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.133
They got my jewels.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.667
But I see they didn't
get your cocaine.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.433
Oh, my God.
Blanche has cocaine?

03:46.100 --> 03:49.433
This is flour.
I hid my jewels in the flour.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.734
Why did you hide
your jewels in the flour?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.333
Because I didn't think
they'd look there.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.300
What kind of robbers
look in the flour?

03:55.367 --> 03:58.367
That's the first place they look
after the freezer.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.266
The freezer's my other hidin' place.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.433
It's everybody's.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.567
The robbers know that. They don't
even open drawers anymore.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.266
My mama's jewels,
I can never replace them!

04:09.667 --> 04:11.800
Oh, I'm just beside myself.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.033
And you ought to see the mess
they made in there.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.900
They about tore this place apart.

04:15.967 --> 04:18.033
They were probably
looking for drugs.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.300
We have Maalox and Estrogen.

04:28.633 --> 04:31.800
Now, how many junkies
have gas and hot flashes?

04:32.834 --> 04:36.166
Well, they cleaned me out,
took everything I owned.

04:36.233 --> 04:39.333
-All I have is what I have on.
-They took your clothes?

04:39.400 --> 04:43.633
My clothes, my shoes, girdle,
everything. Thank God I'm insured.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.600
Ma, why in the world
would they want your clothes?

04:46.667 --> 04:51.000
Who knows? Short girl robber,
travels a lot, likes drip-dry.

04:52.734 --> 04:56.834
It's ok. I'm thrilled. I hated
my clothes. I need new clothes.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.567
They didn't take them, ma.
You hid them.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.767
Now, where are your clothes?

05:04.433 --> 05:05.900
Maybe I buried them.

05:06.967 --> 05:10.734
What I can't understand is why they
didn't take my Chinese vase.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.300
-Who would want it?
-Ma!

05:14.133 --> 05:17.166
You know why this happened?
Because we're without men.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.233
-What?
-I don't know what happens or why.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.967
All I know is, when I had a husband,
I didn't worry.

05:23.033 --> 05:26.100
Maybe nothing happened to me because
I had a husband, and maybe not.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.834
All I know is, when the lights went
out at night, I wasn't afraid.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.433
It's karma.
I beg your pardon?

05:34.233 --> 05:37.233
Crime is caused by karma.
Some people give out an energy

05:37.300 --> 05:39.767
that attracts misfortune.
They become victims.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.767
Well, it must've been one of you.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.800
I certainly don't have
that kind of energy.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.266
'Course, I lost my mama's jewels
because of somebody else's energy.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.000
I got no energy. I'm going to sleep.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.500
Blanche, come on. Don't be absurd.

05:55.567 --> 05:57.834
Look, we were robbed,
and now it's over.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.100
It has nothing to do with energy. It
has nothing to do with being single.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.767
It has to do with a lousy lock
on a sliding door

06:04.834 --> 06:06.667
and massive unemployment.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.967
Now, I'm going into my room.
Call me when the cops come.

06:09.033 --> 06:12.266
We're all employed, Dorothy,
except your mother.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.066
I wouldn't call that "massive."

06:16.734 --> 06:18.100
Good night, Rose.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.333
Go to sleep, sweetheart.
Pray for brains.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.233
Well, this is not the end.
I can promise you that.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.233
Justice will be done here.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.500
I hate criminals. I just hate 'em!

06:33.567 --> 06:35.800
Someone's gonna pay
for this heinous crime!

06:35.867 --> 06:38.200
We're gonna have a good,
old-fashioned hangin'.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.800
That's right, a hangin'.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.266
Only first, we'll have a whippin'...
and then we'll have a hangin'.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.667
Nobody takes my mama's jewels
without swingin' for it.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.767
Nighty-night.

07:00.734 --> 07:03.967
So those are the facts, ladies.
It's not a pretty picture.

07:04.033 --> 07:08.567
One out of every three people will
be the victim of a violent crime.

07:08.633 --> 07:11.567
-That's awful!
-And since there are four of you,

07:11.633 --> 07:14.133
that means at least one
of you will be a victim...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.600
of a violent crime.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.934
One of you right here.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.700
And I read that one out of every
three people will get cancer.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.967
Well, that means
one of us will get cancer.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.166
So, that takes care of two of us.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.166
Oh, knock it off.

07:33.233 --> 07:36.100
Now, we'll take
the basic security package, ok?

07:36.166 --> 07:38.700
-How much did you say it would be?
-$600.

07:38.767 --> 07:39.967
Fine, we'll take it.

07:40.033 --> 07:42.400
It's better than nothing,
but not much.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.367
What do you mean?

07:44.433 --> 07:47.900
Well, for $600, you get a siren
that your neighbors ignore.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.600
But with our deluxe system, an armed
guard is here within five minutes.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.233
I want something that
electrocutes an intruder.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.667
How much more
is the deluxe system?

07:59.033 --> 08:01.166
Ladies, we're talking
about the difference

08:01.233 --> 08:04.700
between being here in the morning
or being steak tartar.

08:05.266 --> 08:07.867
-How much more?
-A bit more.

08:07.934 --> 08:09.533
-How much?
-Exactly?

08:09.600 --> 08:11.500
-Yes.
-$10,000.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.000
I'd rather be murdered.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.400
Now, I want a great, big wall safe.

08:16.467 --> 08:19.166
You don't need one anymore.
You got no jewelry.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.166
Well, I'll get it back.

08:21.233 --> 08:23.667
I went to the police today
with some sketches I made.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.734
How could you make sketches?
You didn't see the robbers.

08:27.433 --> 08:29.734
Not of the robbers,
of my mama's jewels.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.867
Ok, ok, we're getting the basic
system.

08:32.934 --> 08:34.300
-Whatever.
-But not from you.

08:34.367 --> 08:35.867
-From your competitor.
-What?

08:35.934 --> 08:37.133
Because what you were
trying to do

08:37.200 --> 08:40.400
was terrify us into spending
more money than we have.

08:40.467 --> 08:43.133
Now, get out of here,
before the victim of violent crime

08:43.200 --> 08:45.033
in this house is you!

08:50.967 --> 08:53.500
-He scared me to death!
-Oh, me, too.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.900
He scared me too,
but you wanna know something?

08:55.967 --> 08:59.633
It could be worse.
I mean, we could each be alone.

08:59.934 --> 09:03.333
At least we're together.
We have each other.

09:07.233 --> 09:10.433
-It's better with men.
-Oh, that's false security.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.667
No, it's not.
I was safer with Charles.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.667
I was never once robbed or murdered
when I was with Charles.

09:19.934 --> 09:23.734
Look, you could just as easily have
been murdered living with Charles.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.367
I'm surprised she wasn't
murdered by Charles.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.734
With George, when I'd hear a noise,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.600
I'd wake him up
and then he'd take out his gun.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.934
And then he'd have
to find the bullets,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.567
'cause I'd always hide the bullets.

09:37.633 --> 09:40.934
And then, when he found
the bullets, we'd make love.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.100
Boy, can you tell a story!

09:49.233 --> 09:51.433
I'm starved.
Come on, let's make dinner.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.233
(dog barking)

09:53.300 --> 09:55.567
Oh, well, I'm not really
all that hungry.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.300
-I forgot all about him.
-Yeah, you go on in there.

09:58.367 --> 10:02.700
-Getting a guard dog was your idea.
-I'm afraid of large dogs.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.967
When I was three, I was attacked
by a Cocker Spaniel.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.633
A cocker spaniel's not a large dog.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.500
To a three-year-old, it is.

10:11.300 --> 10:15.033
We got a guard dog in the kitchen.
Great, the food is safe!

10:17.266 --> 10:18.800
I know what we can do.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.333
Let's go out to dinner, my treat.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.600
What about breakfast and lunch?

10:23.667 --> 10:25.834
Look, I'm calling the Kennel
to come get him.

10:26.133 --> 10:29.066
I've got a date tonight
and no jewelry to wear.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.200
Some scum's woman is wearing
my mama's jewelry.

10:32.867 --> 10:35.800
I wonder if jewelry comes
from Jewish people.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.233
In Little Falls,
the jeweler was Jewish.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.233
Jeweler, Jewish...
I wonder if there's a connection?

10:44.333 --> 10:45.800
I think there's a connection

10:45.867 --> 10:48.300
between your brain
and wallpaper paste.

10:53.533 --> 10:56.567
I don't know why people
even have dogs at all.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.433
I don't like anything
in my house that doesn't know

10:58.500 --> 10:59.734
how to use the toilet.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.367
-See ya.
-Oh, no, Sophia!

11:03.433 --> 11:05.433
(dog barking)

11:05.500 --> 11:10.033
-No, Sophia! Dorothy! Dorothy!
-Dorothy! Oh!

11:10.100 --> 11:11.233
What, what?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.567
-Oh, God, I don't know how to tell--
-What?

11:13.633 --> 11:15.233
-Oh, it's about your mother.
-Ma?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.700
Oh, my God, and the dog,
I think he ate your mother.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.166
Ma!

11:19.800 --> 11:21.567
Some attack dog.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.567
He hid under the table,
peed on the floor,

11:23.633 --> 11:24.967
and ran out the back.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.600
Oh, give me that!

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I thought I was gonna die.

11:38.066 --> 11:40.834
I swear, I have never felt
such agony.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.333
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes,

11:44.400 --> 11:47.000
and I thought,
what a shame if I die now.

11:47.066 --> 11:48.400
I'm too young.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.133
And I'm wearing the wrong underwear.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.533
-(alarm blaring)
-Oh!

11:57.600 --> 11:59.400
Oh! Oh!

12:01.900 --> 12:04.333
I'm sorry, it's just me.
I had to get in quickly

12:04.400 --> 12:05.800
'cause when I got out of the car,

12:05.867 --> 12:08.100
I noticed a swarthy man
with a weapon.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.000
-Swarthy man with a weapon?
-What are you doing?

12:12.233 --> 12:14.066
<i>Buenos Dias,</i> Fernando.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.000
The gardener, trimming the hedge.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.433
-I was running, he was blurred...
-(Blanche) Ohh...

12:20.500 --> 12:24.100
-Oh, no! Blanche has been attacked!
-Sort of.

12:24.367 --> 12:27.000
Oh, honey, what happened,
you poor darling?

12:27.066 --> 12:30.800
I went to the police station today
to get an update on my case.

12:30.867 --> 12:33.734
I borrowed your pocket hairspray.
I took it from your dressing table.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.100
You know what this humidity
does to my hair.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.567
I know... cotton candy.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.600
Well, just as I entered
the police station,

12:42.667 --> 12:46.000
I saw there was this cute officer
there who's had his eye on me,

12:46.066 --> 12:50.233
so I took out your hairspray
and gave my hair a final spritz.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.867
Only, surprise, it wasn't hairspray.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.333
It was mace.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.734
You had mace.
Your hairspray was mace.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.567
I maced myself right there
in the police station!

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
I almost died. I fell to the floor
blinded, writhing in pain.

13:09.066 --> 13:11.033
Couldn't move for 20 minutes.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.867
Well, what do you know? It works!

13:16.367 --> 13:19.500
Works?
They thought I was on angel dust.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.133
They wanted to arrest me!

13:23.200 --> 13:26.667
I'm lyin' there, dyin',
and they're harassing me.

13:26.967 --> 13:29.166
Murderers are free,
rapists are free,

13:29.233 --> 13:32.533
but a poor widow on the floor,
they try to lock up.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
Who'd I hurt, me?

13:34.667 --> 13:40.066
Now, look, Rose.
This is it. We have had it!

13:40.133 --> 13:44.133
-No mace, no tear gas, no grenades!
-No jewelry.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.800
I won't be needing mace.
I just bought a gun.

13:47.867 --> 13:50.467
You don't know how to use a gun!

13:50.533 --> 13:52.533
The man at the gun store
taught me.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.133
In the basement, they've got
a little shooting gallery,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.500
kind of like the ones
at amusement parks.

13:57.967 --> 14:02.200
Except no prizes. And you shoot
at little paper targets.

14:02.700 --> 14:03.967
This was mine.

14:05.066 --> 14:08.900
-Honey, there are no holes in it.
-I know!

14:08.967 --> 14:10.834
That's because they're all
in your head.

14:12.367 --> 14:15.633
Now, listen. I cannot live
in a house with a gun.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.967
Dorothy, don't overreact.
Rose, good.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.900
-You get a gun, you kill 'em!
-Yeah.

14:20.266 --> 14:22.100
Kill 'em.
We'll have a dead gardener.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.400
Now, listen.
Rose, this has gone too far.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.333
You are going overboard.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.567
Now, I think you need
to see someone.

14:29.633 --> 14:33.033
Dorothy, I don't think a date
is necessarily the answer.

14:34.033 --> 14:37.200
I meant a psychiatrist, hot pants.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.533
Well, now, what do you say, Rose?

14:42.934 --> 14:45.100
Come on, honey, we'll all go.

14:45.834 --> 14:49.200
-You think I'm crazy.
-No, I don't.

14:49.266 --> 14:51.934
But I do think you need help.
I mean, you don't eat,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.033
you don't sleep,
you're afraid all the time.

14:56.166 --> 14:59.834
You got nothing to fear
but fear itself...

15:01.633 --> 15:03.633
and, of course, the boogeyman.

15:11.934 --> 15:13.967
I always heard psychiatrists
could read your mind,

15:14.033 --> 15:15.133
but he didn't do that.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.533
Because there's nothing
in your mind to read.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.867
Ma!

15:18.934 --> 15:21.667
Well, anyway, I liked him.
He was very understanding.

15:21.734 --> 15:24.533
Pay me $85,
I'll be understanding...

15:25.166 --> 15:26.767
and make you marble cake.

15:27.233 --> 15:30.133
-And he liked me.
-Oh, Blanche, how do you know that?

15:30.200 --> 15:33.333
'Cause he kept saying,
"Blanche, how do you feel?"

15:33.667 --> 15:37.000
I wanted to say, "wouldn't you just
like to know, big boy?"

15:37.600 --> 15:40.633
I hate psychiatrists. They blame
everything on the mothers.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.767
Sophia, he didn't blame you.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.266
You heard what he said--

15:44.333 --> 15:47.000
"We're afraid because our
mothers taught us to be afraid."

15:47.066 --> 15:49.667
For survival, ma.
They had to.

15:49.734 --> 15:51.400
I mean, what's a mother
supposed to say?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.300
"Don't be afraid of strangers.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.533
Eat their candy.
Get into their cars"?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.533
-Well, he made me feel better.
-Me, too.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.734
I was just thrilled
to be out of there.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.934
He had two dead fish
in his tank.

16:04.333 --> 16:08.834
Of course, your speech endorsing
public beheadings with no trial,

16:08.900 --> 16:10.667
I think got him a little concerned.

16:11.667 --> 16:15.300
I know. He wants to see me again,
but I think it's personal.

16:16.967 --> 16:19.033
In my day, we didn't have therapy.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.567
-We were too busy looking for food.
-Looking for food?

16:21.633 --> 16:23.900
You mean, to take back
to your cave?

16:25.033 --> 16:27.367
Rose, your father
was a dairy farmer.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.233
You looked for food
in your freezer.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.100
The psychiatrist
didn't make me feel better.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.333
I feel better
that you all feel better,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.100
but I don't feel any better.

16:36.166 --> 16:39.667
Not even a little?
No. In fact, I feel worse.

16:39.734 --> 16:43.033
-Why worse?
-He was my last hope.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.433
Now, I've got to get some sleep.
I have to get up pretty soon.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.233
-Good night, everybody.
-(Blanche) Good night, honey.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.700
Good night?

16:51.633 --> 16:53.533
Boy, we really have a problem.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.066
I know. The police are doing
nothing about my jewels.

16:58.734 --> 17:01.533
Not that!
There is a woman in there

17:01.600 --> 17:04.033
so terrified something
is going to happen at night

17:04.100 --> 17:06.033
that she sleeps only
in the daytime.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.367
I know. And then at sunset,
she makes a big pot of coffee

17:08.433 --> 17:10.800
and sits up all night
with that gun.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.033
It's better than having that dog...

17:13.867 --> 17:15.834
as long as she doesn't
wet the floor.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.533
(thumping)

17:28.600 --> 17:30.600
(muffled voices)

17:36.233 --> 17:39.500
(alarm blaring)

17:40.266 --> 17:43.400
(gasps) You shot my vase.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.734
I heard footsteps and a man's voice,
and the alarm went off!

17:48.800 --> 17:51.467
It was Lester.
He accidentally set off the alarm!

17:51.533 --> 17:54.800
-Oh, I'm sorry!
-You shot my vase!

17:54.867 --> 17:58.166
-I didn't shoot Lester.
-I'd rather you shot Lester.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.200
I think I'll pass
on the nightcap, Blanche.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.934
Go on home, you old fool.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.867
-What happened?
-She shot my vase!

18:06.934 --> 18:09.133
Thank God. I hated that thing.

18:11.266 --> 18:14.333
What are you doing shooting?
Are you crazy?

18:14.400 --> 18:16.500
I heard a noise.
I thought it was the robbers.

18:16.567 --> 18:19.500
I manage to live 80, 81 years.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.000
I survive pneumonia,
two operations, a stroke...

18:23.066 --> 18:26.600
one night, I'll belch, and stable
Mabel here will blow my head off!

18:28.967 --> 18:33.133
Rose, you've got to do something!
This is crippling you!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.467
Just save whatever pieces you find,
Sophia.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.066
I can glue it back together.

18:37.133 --> 18:40.467
You bet, whatever I find.
I love that vase.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.233
Rose, Rose, you cannot
go on this way.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.867
I mean, life isn't worth living

18:48.934 --> 18:51.667
if you're gonna live it
with this kind of fear.

18:51.734 --> 18:56.233
Now, honey, we were robbed.
It's scary, but it happens.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.166
And now it's over,
and the robbers are gone.

19:00.233 --> 19:03.233
I know. I know that.
I know it's over.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.967
I know they're gone,
but not for me!

19:06.300 --> 19:10.567
For me, in my mind,
they'll always be here!

19:10.633 --> 19:12.266
Oh, honey.

19:26.734 --> 19:30.300
(footsteps)

19:37.734 --> 19:38.934
Oh, dear God.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.734
(footsteps continue)

19:47.066 --> 19:48.300
Lady, wait!

19:49.800 --> 19:50.967
Hey, lady!

19:54.834 --> 19:57.600
(gasping)

20:02.800 --> 20:05.734
Three and one is four,
and ten is 14.

20:05.800 --> 20:10.000
And a double letter score
is 18, 19, 20, 23.

20:10.066 --> 20:12.200
And a triple word score

20:12.266 --> 20:15.133
makes a total of 69 points. I win.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.333
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.467
There is no such word as that.

20:20.266 --> 20:21.633
There certainly is.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.166
Fine. I'll look it up,

20:23.233 --> 20:25.266
and if it isn't in the dictionary,
I win.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.500
-We don't have a dictionary.
-Yes, we do.

20:27.567 --> 20:32.100
-Not anymore. The robbers took it.
-They stole our dictionary?

20:32.166 --> 20:34.467
That's right. Too bad.

20:36.533 --> 20:40.800
Ma, "disdam" is not a word.
You made it up.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.166
-It's a word.
-Fine. Use it in a sentence.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.800
"You're no good at disdam game."

21:02.367 --> 21:04.633
They caught them.
They caught the scum.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.600
Oh, that's wonderful, Blanche!

21:06.667 --> 21:08.433
It is for you.
They found your stole.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.633
-They didn't find my jewels.
-Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.734
They can sell my jewelry, you see.
It's worth something.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.333
Who'd want that thing?
Nobody wears stoles anymore.

21:20.033 --> 21:23.166
My mama's jewels,
out there on the black market,

21:23.233 --> 21:25.066
being fondled by filth.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.834
I just can't wait
to testify in court.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.400
I want to see those guys fry.

21:30.834 --> 21:34.300
Well, everybody, you will
never guess what I did today.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.633
-What?
-I was in this parking garage.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.233
I had to go to the dentist

21:39.300 --> 21:41.367
'cause I lost my crown
in a nectarine yesterday.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.333
And there was no parking
on the street.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.433
There I was, all alone.

21:46.166 --> 21:48.233
-I heard footsteps.
-Ooh.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.000
It was my nightmare come true.
Someone was after me.

21:51.066 --> 21:54.400
I ran, he ran.
I ran faster, he ran faster.

21:54.467 --> 21:56.066
-(Dorothy) No!
-He grabbed my arm,

21:56.133 --> 21:59.200
and I turned around and dropped him.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.667
Kneed him right
in his safe-deposit box.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.567
Dropped him like a sack of potatoes.

22:06.633 --> 22:09.367
He lay on the ground,
and he was writhing

22:09.433 --> 22:11.400
and groaning
and screaming in agony.

22:11.467 --> 22:13.200
And I stood over him...

22:13.266 --> 22:16.467
and I looked
at this pitiable creature...

22:16.967 --> 22:20.000
and I thought,
"I can take care of myself!"

22:20.300 --> 22:22.834
I'm not helpless. I'm gonna be ok!

22:22.900 --> 22:25.800
-Oh, honey, that's wonderful!
-Oh, honey, that's fantastic!

22:25.867 --> 22:29.000
I have faith again.
Kill the killers!

22:29.533 --> 22:31.333
This calls for champagne.
I'll get it.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.967
No, honey, there's none on ice.

22:33.033 --> 22:35.400
I'll put some in the freezer.
It'll be ready in 20 minutes.

22:35.467 --> 22:38.567
Oh, so what happens now?
I guess you press charges, right?

22:38.633 --> 22:40.967
Well, no. No, actually not.

22:41.033 --> 22:42.734
He might press charges, though.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.700
Why?

22:44.767 --> 22:47.800
You see, the guy that was
moaning and screaming

22:47.867 --> 22:50.734
and groaning in agony
was the parking attendant.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.233
He was coming after me because
I'd forgot to pick up my keys.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.166
But I'm not afraid anymore!

22:58.233 --> 23:00.233
I know that when it comes
right down to it,

23:00.300 --> 23:01.600
I can take care of myself.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.900
Oh, honey,
I always knew you could.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.433
-Oh, damn.
-What?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.834
-My jewelry...
-Oh, please, Blanche.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.767
-Enough with your jewelry!
-No, I found it.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.867
-What?
-It was in the freezer!

23:14.934 --> 23:17.066
Oh, Blanche, that's wonderful!

23:17.133 --> 23:18.700
It was there all the time?

23:18.767 --> 23:20.000
And, you know,
if you'd had your way,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.667
the robbers would've been beheaded.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.533
Well, that doesn't matter.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.667
The point is, they stole your stole.

23:25.734 --> 23:27.934
A beautiful stole.
You can't replace it.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.333
They don't make 'em anymore.
Look here...
