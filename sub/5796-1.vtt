00:46.376 --> 00:51.459
The 2,489 ton ship Taiping

00:51.501 --> 00:53.001
sets sail from Shanghai

00:53.417 --> 00:55.751
with a crew of 124

00:55.792 --> 00:58.126
508 paying passengers

00:58.167 --> 01:00.542
300 non-paying passengers

01:01.334 --> 01:05.042
100 tons of printing equipment from
the Southeast Daily News

01:05.084 --> 01:08.376
1,000 boxes of documents belonging
to the Central Bank

01:08.417 --> 01:09.917
200 crates of silver

01:10.167 --> 01:12.626
and 600 tons of steel

01:13.251 --> 01:14.376
Mr. Yuan

01:15.084 --> 01:16.126
You can't load anymore

01:21.626 --> 01:24.042
Taiping, overweight by 43 tons

01:24.084 --> 01:26.626
collided with the cargo vessel Jianyuan

01:26.709 --> 01:29.126
off the coast of Zhejiang Province

01:29.167 --> 01:33.042
at a quarter to midnight

01:39.376 --> 01:42.792
Taiping sank after forty-five minutes

01:42.834 --> 01:45.459
Of close to one thousand passengers on board

01:45.501 --> 01:48.376
only 34 were found
by the Australian naval destroyer

01:48.417 --> 01:52.042
HMAS Warramunga

03:18.251 --> 03:19.584
How are you?

03:20.667 --> 03:24.542
I am en route to Taiwan from Shanghai

03:25.209 --> 03:28.667
In order to combine our photos

03:29.126 --> 03:31.251
I had to spend quite a bit of time

03:32.334 --> 03:35.084
But I am sure you will like it

03:35.917 --> 03:38.376
It's been four years since the war ended

03:38.584 --> 03:42.376
But till now I have yet to hear anything from you

03:42.876 --> 03:45.459
I hope all is well

03:45.792 --> 03:48.167
and I await your reply

03:59.792 --> 04:00.959
Yifang

04:01.292 --> 04:02.626
I don't want to go to Taiwan

04:03.334 --> 04:04.584
I thought we already agreed

04:05.251 --> 04:07.084
that I would join you after the war

04:08.001 --> 04:10.792
Are you asking me to go because
the war is going badly?

04:11.834 --> 04:14.334
The Communists have already taken the north

04:16.334 --> 04:17.584
If we lose the south

04:18.250 --> 04:19.666
Shanghai will be in chaos

04:20.959 --> 04:22.792
It's only when you're someplace safe

04:23.584 --> 04:25.167
can I then concentrate on fighting

06:02.876 --> 06:05.167
"KEELUNG PORT"

06:34.459 --> 06:35.126
Stop

06:35.542 --> 06:36.292
Papers?

06:43.209 --> 06:45.459
Yan Zekun? Follow me

06:46.751 --> 06:48.376
Did you report to police headquarters?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.542
No

06:50.751 --> 06:52.167
This is a person of interest

06:58.584 --> 07:00.834
You spent time in Fengtian prisoner of war camp?

07:01.626 --> 07:02.501
Yes

07:06.834 --> 07:07.459
Are you tired?

07:07.667 --> 07:08.126
Nope

07:08.251 --> 07:08.917
Here, allow me

07:08.959 --> 07:10.042
Did you wait long?

07:10.626 --> 07:11.959
How was your trip to Shanghai?

07:12.292 --> 07:16.251
Chaotic. A lot of student demonstrations
and protests

07:17.084 --> 07:18.334
Good thing I still managed to get the medicine

07:19.126 --> 07:20.459
Let's get some fruits

07:22.584 --> 07:23.709
How much are these?

07:27.917 --> 07:29.376
Arresting Communists again

07:29.417 --> 07:31.584
They always end up arresting students

07:31.626 --> 07:33.584
So many people have lost their lives already

07:33.626 --> 07:35.376
Taiwan is such a small place

07:35.417 --> 07:37.417
How many Communists could there possibly be?

07:37.751 --> 07:40.126
I feel so sorry for those students

07:40.459 --> 07:43.126
Some of those taken away will never come back

07:43.417 --> 07:44.834
I do not know...

07:52.334 --> 07:53.792
Come, let's head back

08:03.376 --> 08:04.417
Ready!

08:12.626 --> 08:13.667
Zekun

08:18.584 --> 08:21.626
Zekun, I heard that

08:21.792 --> 08:23.792
you have returned safe to Keelung

08:24.876 --> 08:27.667
I can finally put my heart at ease

08:28.667 --> 08:29.834
But

08:30.126 --> 08:33.083
I wish that you would write to me

08:38.876 --> 08:39.667
Mother

08:40.333 --> 08:41.417
Zekun is back

08:51.792 --> 08:54.376
This house formerly belonged
to a Japanese colonel

08:54.626 --> 08:57.209
It was destroyed by
the allies during the war

08:57.501 --> 08:59.751
But it's been repaired

09:01.376 --> 09:02.167
Yifang

09:02.501 --> 09:05.459
Whenever I recall you helping me put on my shoe

09:05.876 --> 09:07.001
I break out into laughter

09:08.126 --> 09:11.292
But after laughing I feel a bit guilty

09:12.917 --> 09:14.459
You are far away fighting a war

09:14.917 --> 09:17.667
experiencing things I cannot even imagine

09:18.334 --> 09:22.042
while I live carefree and without worry

09:24.834 --> 09:27.251
Our new place has a big yard

09:28.126 --> 09:29.584
I will plant

09:29.876 --> 09:30.917
all of our orchids here

09:33.459 --> 09:34.834
The child and I

09:35.709 --> 09:37.251
will wait for your return

09:45.417 --> 09:46.542
Now

09:46.626 --> 09:47.751
I can finally have peace of mind

09:48.042 --> 09:49.417
and write you a song

10:00.001 --> 10:02.042
"TAIWANESE STUDENTS
AGAINST COLONIZATION"

10:09.667 --> 10:13.084
You are the only two men left in the family

10:14.876 --> 10:16.917
Your eldest brother Zehan had lung problems

10:18.792 --> 10:20.292
When the Japanese surrendered Taiwan to China

10:22.292 --> 10:24.167
He shouted loudly

10:24.917 --> 10:26.084
We've returned to the motherland

10:26.334 --> 10:27.667
We're Chinese again

10:29.251 --> 10:30.667
We're Chinese again

10:32.459 --> 10:33.584
Taiwan is part of China again

10:34.042 --> 10:35.501
We're Chinese again

10:36.084 --> 10:37.167
We're Chinese again

10:37.209 --> 10:38.001
Later

10:38.042 --> 10:39.751
they accused him of being a Communist

10:42.334 --> 10:43.876
and shot him

10:50.459 --> 10:53.417
Your father

10:53.459 --> 10:55.251
received a Japanese education

10:56.417 --> 10:58.417
and we lived in a Japanese house

10:58.459 --> 11:00.292
But when it came to taking a Japanese name

11:00.334 --> 11:02.167
he absolutely refused

11:03.292 --> 11:06.459
He became a doctor, hoping to do good

11:08.292 --> 11:09.792
and yet, for no rhyme or reason

11:10.667 --> 11:12.417
he was taken away by the police

11:13.251 --> 11:14.876
Who knows what for?

11:17.292 --> 11:19.167
At that time you weren't home

11:19.917 --> 11:20.876
Mother

11:22.084 --> 11:26.584
Zekun volunteered to take
Zehan's place for the draft

11:27.542 --> 11:31.251
It wasn't easy for him either

11:33.126 --> 11:35.917
Your younger brother is my last hope

11:36.626 --> 11:38.876
I don't want the same fate to befall him

11:39.584 --> 11:41.084
You must keep a close watch on him

12:02.417 --> 12:03.376
Anti-government organization?

12:03.709 --> 12:04.459
Give it to me

12:06.417 --> 12:07.042
Stop running!

12:07.417 --> 12:08.542
Don't let him get away

12:10.126 --> 12:11.334
Go...

13:28.251 --> 13:29.417
Listen, this flower...

13:29.459 --> 13:30.292
I have no idea what you're saying

13:30.334 --> 13:31.542
- You're just stubborn!
- Plant it inside

13:31.584 --> 13:32.751
Give it to me! It's mine

13:32.792 --> 13:33.417
What are you babbling about?

13:33.459 --> 13:35.334
- It needs direct sunlight
- Stop messing around

13:35.417 --> 13:36.334
It will grow best...

13:36.376 --> 13:37.334
You don't know anything

13:37.376 --> 13:38.751
I don't understand you

13:38.959 --> 13:40.126
- Where do you want it?
- Stop arguing

13:40.251 --> 13:41.542
What's going on?

13:42.709 --> 13:43.959
Miss, she...

13:44.417 --> 13:46.001
She talks in Taiwanese and then Japanese

13:46.042 --> 13:46.584
No one can understand her

13:46.709 --> 13:47.667
You... speak Mandarin

13:47.792 --> 13:48.501
Miss

13:48.709 --> 13:49.417
I'm telling him

13:49.501 --> 13:51.834
Orchids need direct sunlight

13:51.959 --> 13:52.792
That's how they grow best

13:52.876 --> 13:54.001
But he keeps spouting nonsense

13:54.042 --> 13:55.792
I said let's plant it here but he...

13:56.792 --> 13:57.751
You wily old fox!

13:57.959 --> 14:00.542
Give it back to me

14:00.584 --> 14:01.334
Come get it yourself

14:02.376 --> 14:04.542
- Come on
- That's mine

14:05.167 --> 14:06.751
Give me the flower

14:08.167 --> 14:09.376
Miss! What happened

14:09.876 --> 14:10.709
Miss

14:13.667 --> 14:14.876
What the?

14:15.542 --> 14:17.709
Mister, you must listen to the doctor

14:18.501 --> 14:19.626
His prescription

14:19.917 --> 14:21.626
There's another patient outside

14:22.209 --> 14:23.251
Come with me

14:23.959 --> 14:24.876
Zekun

14:26.084 --> 14:26.876
Second uncle

14:26.917 --> 14:28.751
I've brought a general's wife

14:28.834 --> 14:30.959
Please give her the best treatment

14:31.167 --> 14:31.917
Sure

14:35.584 --> 14:36.417
Doctor

14:40.084 --> 14:40.751
Madam

14:41.209 --> 14:43.376
This is doctor Yan Zekun

14:43.626 --> 14:44.917
My nephew

14:51.084 --> 14:53.501
Zekun, this is Madam Lei

15:09.167 --> 15:11.001
Do you feel any numbness?

15:11.709 --> 15:12.501
No

15:13.792 --> 15:14.834
It's not poisonous

15:16.167 --> 15:17.792
It's not poisonous

15:17.834 --> 15:19.917
It's okay, we'll reduce the swelling

15:26.001 --> 15:27.209
Do you paint?

15:27.834 --> 15:29.001
Why do you ask that?

15:29.417 --> 15:30.751
I've seen your painting

15:31.459 --> 15:32.751
It was signed by Zekun

15:33.376 --> 15:35.042
in the year 1942

15:44.167 --> 15:45.501
You said you saw my painting?

15:46.126 --> 15:49.167
A girl playing piano amidst a field of silvergrass

15:49.959 --> 15:51.001
Where did you see it?

15:53.834 --> 15:56.001
In the piano room

15:57.917 --> 16:01.001
a notebook was hidden behind the painting

16:04.084 --> 16:05.417
Here it is

16:19.042 --> 16:22.084
She also left behind an unfinished music score

16:23.334 --> 16:24.834
The music is beautiful

16:25.584 --> 16:27.917
She probably wrote it for someone she loved

16:29.209 --> 16:30.334
I really like it

16:33.459 --> 16:35.334
I'd like to finish it for her

16:35.709 --> 16:37.084
How can I help you?

16:37.126 --> 16:39.126
Please tell me something about her

16:39.667 --> 16:41.084
Knowing how she felt

16:41.209 --> 16:42.376
will help me compose better

16:42.709 --> 16:43.876
Sorry

16:44.751 --> 16:48.042
In my memory, there is only war and death

16:48.876 --> 16:50.251
I can't recall much else

16:52.917 --> 16:54.167
I believe that

16:54.292 --> 16:56.876
this notebook will help you remember

17:02.959 --> 17:07.416
We are often saddened by missed opportunities

17:08.209 --> 17:11.834
Even though this is the wrong time to be in love

17:12.334 --> 17:15.126
I still cannot forget

17:15.791 --> 17:18.959
Your warmth and your every smile

17:19.166 --> 17:22.834
His silence makes me afraid

17:23.084 --> 17:24.834
Your every look

17:25.501 --> 17:29.042
is so real

17:34.709 --> 17:37.417
The draft notice arrived today

17:38.501 --> 17:40.709
My elder brother has lung problems

17:41.042 --> 17:42.917
and my younger brother is still a kid

17:43.292 --> 17:46.834
it has been decided that I will go in their place

17:47.959 --> 17:51.292
It was then that I realized

17:52.292 --> 17:53.709
his silence

17:54.709 --> 17:58.459
was due to his inability
to control his own destiny

18:02.417 --> 18:04.792
On Mother's side in Japan

18:05.376 --> 18:06.542
all her male relatives

18:07.626 --> 18:08.584
are dead

18:09.292 --> 18:10.751
I'm a doctor

18:10.959 --> 18:12.251
so I'll be fine

18:13.001 --> 18:15.376
I'm going to save lives, not destroy them

18:26.334 --> 18:27.584
That day

18:28.917 --> 18:31.626
It was the day before he left

18:38.292 --> 18:39.459
Don't go

18:53.667 --> 18:55.959
Instead of giving ourselves to war

18:57.334 --> 18:58.334
Why not instead

18:58.626 --> 19:00.251
give ourselves to love

19:04.792 --> 19:06.334
At that moment

19:07.459 --> 19:10.084
I finally understood what it meant to be alive

19:46.084 --> 19:47.209
We agreed that

19:47.709 --> 19:48.959
when the war was over

19:49.542 --> 19:50.626
In autumn

19:51.334 --> 19:53.126
we'd come back to this field of silvergrass

19:54.751 --> 19:55.876
We'd walk together

19:57.792 --> 19:59.251
and watch the sunset together

20:06.292 --> 20:07.501
I painted this picture

20:07.542 --> 20:09.376
so I wouldn't forget that day

20:11.084 --> 20:12.751
And she wrote this song

20:14.626 --> 20:16.626
to remind herself not to forget either

20:19.417 --> 20:20.709
That was the only time

20:21.667 --> 20:23.834
I heard her play part of this song

20:24.084 --> 20:26.292
Just a small part

20:29.042 --> 20:31.459
She never thought that she'd leave

20:32.459 --> 20:33.959
After Taiwan returned to China

20:34.126 --> 20:35.126
the policy was that

20:35.417 --> 20:37.042
not a single Japanese was to remain

20:38.126 --> 20:40.667
When her family was repatriated to Japan

20:41.709 --> 20:42.709
that year

20:43.667 --> 20:45.084
I was still in a prisoner of war camp

20:47.626 --> 20:49.251
Everyone thought I was dead

20:54.459 --> 20:56.334
Maybe she thought I was dead too

20:57.084 --> 20:57.834
No

20:59.042 --> 21:00.376
Listening to this song

21:00.417 --> 21:01.501
it feels as if

21:02.209 --> 21:03.751
she's still waiting for you

21:05.501 --> 21:07.792
Then why didn't she finish the song?

21:22.209 --> 21:25.751
Can't continue with too much on my mind

21:26.292 --> 21:29.417
I'll finish it when you come home

21:31.084 --> 21:32.042
Waiting

21:33.126 --> 21:35.001
is more painful than saying goodbye

21:49.042 --> 21:50.001
Cops!

21:50.167 --> 21:51.792
- Arrest them!
- What are you doing

21:52.042 --> 21:53.959
Hold on stand...

22:01.209 --> 22:02.209
Hurry...

22:24.501 --> 22:26.959
Thank you everyone for volunteering

22:27.001 --> 22:28.584
The situation in Shanghai is critical

22:28.626 --> 22:30.126
and the number of wounded is increasing

22:30.334 --> 22:32.334
Here, we provide two meals a day

22:32.417 --> 22:34.292
and that's it

22:34.626 --> 22:36.876
Those who still
want to volunteer can stay behind

22:44.834 --> 22:49.376
Nurse

23:12.334 --> 23:13.042
What are you looking at?

23:13.251 --> 23:14.876
It's not the Yang Tianhu you're looking for

23:15.501 --> 23:17.667
No one today is from
the 7th division 9th brigade

23:18.209 --> 23:19.584
Go get something to eat

23:23.542 --> 23:24.542
The newspapers say

23:24.709 --> 23:27.876
that the 7th division's 9th brigade is in Taiwan

23:28.376 --> 23:30.959
Maybe your Yang Tianhu isn't here anymore

23:33.042 --> 23:35.042
I must find a way to make some money

23:35.792 --> 23:37.001
I want to buy a boat ticket

23:37.251 --> 23:38.959
A boat ticket won't be cheap

23:39.542 --> 23:40.959
I heard that

23:41.709 --> 23:43.959
his name is on the 7th Army's list
of wounded personnel

23:44.417 --> 23:46.751
Most are bogus claims to obtain more rations

23:47.417 --> 23:49.292
For each dead soldier

23:49.417 --> 23:52.709
there are hundreds
of living ones leeching off him

23:53.834 --> 23:55.209
He's not that kind of person

23:58.751 --> 24:00.417
Can you stop being so naive?

24:00.584 --> 24:02.251
This is wartime

24:02.584 --> 24:04.084
Soldiers come and go

24:04.167 --> 24:06.417
sowing their wild oats all over the place

24:06.751 --> 24:08.917
Who can remember who's been with who?

24:09.501 --> 24:10.542
Only just you

24:11.209 --> 24:12.959
You're nuts

24:13.376 --> 24:15.042
Chasing him from Wuhan to Changsha

24:15.084 --> 24:16.584
and now Shanghai

24:16.626 --> 24:19.834
If he were still alive you'd have met ages ago

24:21.042 --> 24:22.751
I believe he's still alive

24:24.209 --> 24:25.584
He once told me that

24:26.334 --> 24:27.959
if a person wants to stay alive

24:29.042 --> 24:30.542
he will definitely find a way to do so

24:32.709 --> 24:34.751
We grew up together in a small village

24:35.751 --> 24:37.542
These past few years he's been off at war

24:38.001 --> 24:39.542
and our village was destroyed

24:40.001 --> 24:42.251
I've been fleeing and searching
for him at the same time

24:43.917 --> 24:45.834
We're both waiting for the war to end

24:46.959 --> 24:47.542
He said

24:48.084 --> 24:52.001
There are millions
of people crawling around like ants

24:53.792 --> 24:56.417
What are the chances that two people can meet?

25:02.584 --> 25:04.084
He also said

25:04.751 --> 25:06.501
that our destiny is determined by heaven

25:06.792 --> 25:08.001
and can be undone by no man

25:09.084 --> 25:10.792
When I volunteered as a nurse in the hospital

25:11.209 --> 25:12.626
it was so that I could search for him

25:12.959 --> 25:15.126
regardless of whether he is dead or alive

25:18.667 --> 25:19.834
You believe him?

25:20.709 --> 25:21.626
I do

25:23.251 --> 25:24.542
But Yu Zhen

25:25.417 --> 25:26.709
Have you considered

25:27.876 --> 25:29.792
that even if you were reunited

25:30.292 --> 25:33.126
You're no longer
that village girl selling beancurd

25:34.501 --> 25:35.834
But I'm still alive

25:39.126 --> 25:40.001
Alive

25:54.917 --> 25:58.084
I have connections in both Shanghai and Taipei

25:58.417 --> 26:00.834
I can guarantee
that none of your ships will sail empty

26:00.876 --> 26:02.334
That's great Mr. Yuan

26:02.959 --> 26:05.209
If you sever all ties with our rival the Zhongxing

26:05.251 --> 26:06.917
everything is open to negotiation

26:09.834 --> 26:12.251
Tickets for sale

26:16.667 --> 26:18.334
Today it's six hundred and fifty thousand

26:18.626 --> 26:19.917
Tomorrow it will be more

26:20.126 --> 26:21.084
You gonna buy or not?

26:21.542 --> 26:22.209
Next

27:13.959 --> 27:14.626
Miss

27:15.292 --> 27:16.334
Have you eaten yet?

27:18.959 --> 27:20.001
Mister

27:20.376 --> 27:21.834
Have you?

27:47.917 --> 27:48.792
Three

27:48.959 --> 27:49.709
Two

27:49.792 --> 27:50.542
One

27:51.001 --> 27:52.667
I really don't have a choice

27:52.834 --> 27:55.292
I can't get family rations without this photo

27:55.334 --> 27:57.084
Think of it as doing me a favor okay?

27:57.376 --> 27:58.251
My name is Tong Daqing

27:58.376 --> 27:59.292
What's yours?

27:59.709 --> 28:00.834
It's not like this is for real

28:01.001 --> 28:02.167
Just pick whatever suits your fancy

28:02.334 --> 28:03.251
Well, hope to see you again

28:03.376 --> 28:04.376
I have to wait for my unit here

28:04.459 --> 28:05.417
Where are you headed?

28:05.584 --> 28:06.751
Going to return the baby

28:07.126 --> 28:08.501
This kid isn't yours?

28:11.084 --> 28:12.251
You're looking to rent?

28:13.001 --> 28:14.667
We don't rent to single women

28:15.042 --> 28:16.251
Do you have your husband's photo?

28:16.459 --> 28:17.251
Yes

28:17.667 --> 28:18.959
Last month he came home to recuperate

28:19.459 --> 28:21.126
We managed to take a photo

29:58.417 --> 30:00.251
I lied about my wife

30:00.626 --> 30:02.167
so I could get more rations

30:02.959 --> 30:05.667
Actually, I'm not married at all

30:06.667 --> 30:08.167
I've been so dishonest

30:08.542 --> 30:10.084
and yet you still trust me so much

30:12.042 --> 30:13.876
Give this to my wife

30:14.459 --> 30:15.709
Don't screw up

30:25.292 --> 30:27.042
General!

30:38.876 --> 30:40.126
Is Yan Zekun at home?

30:43.917 --> 30:46.042
He's on a house call

30:46.084 --> 30:48.334
He didn't reported to police
headquarters this month

30:49.876 --> 30:52.001
Please ask him to come in and explain himself

30:53.501 --> 30:55.292
Also, is Yan-Lin Meifang at home?

30:58.001 --> 31:00.959
She's at work in the fish market

31:01.001 --> 31:02.959
She's directly involved in Yan Zehan's case

31:03.459 --> 31:05.417
Tell her to come to police headquarters as well

31:06.584 --> 31:07.376
Let's go

31:14.834 --> 31:18.334
Meifang, three pieces please

31:51.876 --> 31:52.876
Zekun

31:53.084 --> 31:56.959
Go and register your marriage with Meifang

31:57.376 --> 31:58.959
Take care of the paperwork

32:00.001 --> 32:01.334
Your sister-in-law and nephew

32:01.376 --> 32:03.459
need a man to take care of them

32:04.042 --> 32:06.292
If she remarries someone else

32:07.209 --> 32:09.751
My grandson will take on someone else's name

32:10.792 --> 32:13.126
You need to shoulder
this responsibility for your brother

32:17.084 --> 32:20.417
Is marrying her the only way to take care of her?

32:22.209 --> 32:23.459
What are you saying?

32:26.542 --> 32:28.167
Don't we need to ask her how she feels?

32:28.501 --> 32:29.792
Are you saying that up till now

32:30.792 --> 32:32.876
you're still hung up over that Japanese girl?

32:35.209 --> 32:37.417
I haven't thought about getting married

32:37.584 --> 32:39.876
You don't need to think about it

32:40.626 --> 32:44.001
This matter is settled then

32:52.376 --> 32:54.167
Thank you Mr. Wu

32:54.209 --> 32:55.209
Madam Wang, Madam Zhang

32:55.251 --> 32:57.126
You're getting better and better

32:57.167 --> 32:59.167
Not at all, please come again

33:09.709 --> 33:10.501
You're back

33:16.751 --> 33:17.667
Hello Mr. Gu

33:19.959 --> 33:21.209
Have you eaten yet?

33:21.417 --> 33:22.334
Why don't you join us

33:23.292 --> 33:24.376
No thanks

33:36.251 --> 33:39.626
I've asked Nanny to help you pack up

33:41.167 --> 33:42.042
This room

33:42.626 --> 33:43.709
I am unable

33:43.751 --> 33:45.167
to rent it to you anymore

34:16.542 --> 34:18.626
And what do you do?

34:18.751 --> 34:20.042
You're for sale

34:24.833 --> 34:26.958
You went twice so you need to pay double

34:27.001 --> 34:28.167
What are you doing

34:28.792 --> 34:29.876
Get lost

34:32.167 --> 34:33.292
You're obviously single

34:33.333 --> 34:34.292
but claim you're married

34:34.667 --> 34:35.376
Scram!

34:36.208 --> 34:36.958
Whore!

34:37.001 --> 34:37.708
Shameless

34:37.751 --> 34:38.708
Get lost

34:39.126 --> 34:41.126
What nerve to bring men back

35:57.751 --> 35:58.834
What do you want?

35:58.876 --> 36:00.542
You seem lost

36:00.917 --> 36:02.751
I'm worried someone might take advantage of you

36:05.501 --> 36:07.292
If the price is right I might consider it

36:10.584 --> 36:11.584
Make an offer

36:12.876 --> 36:14.417
Why don't you tell me your price?

36:15.001 --> 36:16.376
since you're the one selling

36:18.542 --> 36:19.709
You might not be able to afford it

36:19.751 --> 36:21.001
Try me

36:21.459 --> 36:24.084
This world is full of opportunities

36:24.584 --> 36:26.501
If you don't try, how will you know?

36:28.876 --> 36:30.501
I want a boat ticket

36:33.167 --> 36:34.626
A boat ticket to Taiwan

36:34.667 --> 36:35.751
That's it?

36:36.084 --> 36:40.334
My goods are on that ship, headed for Taiwan

36:40.459 --> 36:43.167
Getting a ticket is a piece of cake

36:49.792 --> 36:51.501
We can go to your place

36:53.084 --> 36:54.417
My place is out of the question

36:54.917 --> 36:57.667
I think this place is pretty good

37:46.667 --> 37:48.834
We agreed on a boat ticket

37:49.042 --> 37:51.417
You think I don't know how much a hooker costs?

37:53.626 --> 37:55.126
The price we agreed upon

37:55.542 --> 37:56.792
was a boat ticket

37:57.042 --> 37:58.959
Do you have any idea how much that costs?

37:59.001 --> 38:00.834
Yesterday it was six hundred and fifty thousand

38:01.334 --> 38:04.917
Today it's seven hundred and eighty five thousand

38:06.376 --> 38:08.959
Even if I slept with all the men in Shanghai

38:10.251 --> 38:12.792
I still wouldn't be able to afford a ticket

38:13.417 --> 38:14.917
Just give me a ticket

38:15.167 --> 38:16.501
since you have connections

38:17.709 --> 38:19.459
I can let you have another go

38:19.667 --> 38:21.834
I'm not that interested in you

38:22.292 --> 38:24.542
You're out of your mind. A boat ticket?

38:24.917 --> 38:26.542
Take it or leave it

38:33.542 --> 38:34.334
Take back your money

38:34.917 --> 38:35.876
Money isn't worth anything

38:36.459 --> 38:37.501
I want a boat ticket

38:37.751 --> 38:38.584
You promised me

38:38.792 --> 38:39.876
Don't try this with me

38:40.042 --> 38:41.626
or I'm going to call the cops on you

38:43.376 --> 38:44.584
Let go!

38:45.584 --> 38:47.084
You're shameless

38:47.459 --> 38:48.876
You know why I took an interest to you?

38:49.751 --> 38:51.417
I usually go for classy ladies

38:51.459 --> 38:53.542
If all the dance halls in Shanghai weren't closed

38:55.376 --> 38:57.001
you think I'd even look at crap like you?

39:00.584 --> 39:02.542
I took pity on you

39:02.667 --> 39:04.376
Thought you seemed pretty alright

39:05.209 --> 39:07.834
I don't even know
why I bother talking to a whore like you

39:08.376 --> 39:10.542
You might have some kind of disease for all I know

39:54.584 --> 39:56.334
You told me

39:59.292 --> 40:01.542
if I don't try, how would I know?

40:03.584 --> 40:05.459
I believed you

40:06.542 --> 40:09.209
When I believe someone,
I believe him wholeheartedly

40:14.667 --> 40:16.584
Shouldn't it be that way?

40:33.417 --> 40:38.834
I only want a boat ticket

40:49.792 --> 40:51.834
I only want a boat ticket

41:29.792 --> 41:30.959
Zeming

41:33.584 --> 41:34.417
Zeming

41:49.251 --> 41:50.459
Zeming

41:50.876 --> 41:52.084
Zeming

41:53.959 --> 41:54.667
Zeming

41:55.001 --> 41:55.542
Mother

42:01.417 --> 42:02.376
Mother

42:04.876 --> 42:05.667
Mother

42:06.209 --> 42:08.292
I must carry on father's work

42:08.751 --> 42:11.001
and continue fighting for a better society

42:12.167 --> 42:13.709
A new China is coming

42:14.542 --> 42:15.751
When that day arrives

42:16.626 --> 42:17.751
I'll come home

42:18.334 --> 42:19.751
Why are you going to Shanghai?

42:22.334 --> 42:23.667
I'm a doctor

42:24.042 --> 42:25.459
I'm going to Shanghai to purchase medicine

42:37.501 --> 42:38.209
Zeming

42:45.834 --> 42:47.251
Zeming

42:53.917 --> 42:55.792
Zeming

43:29.292 --> 43:31.417
My mother's relatives

43:31.459 --> 43:35.001
all died during the war

43:36.042 --> 43:43.042
I eke out an existence by collecting scrap metal

43:43.334 --> 43:49.251
Japan is a foreign place to me

43:50.459 --> 43:52.709
I miss Keelung

43:55.417 --> 44:00.209
I always imagine you by the sea

44:00.834 --> 44:07.376
I wish the sea would take me back

44:07.917 --> 44:14.959
Perhaps like this, we can meet once more

45:01.751 --> 45:04.626
Each day as I face death

45:05.292 --> 45:08.459
That I can still have someone to think of

45:09.209 --> 45:12.001
is my greatest fortune

45:21.459 --> 45:24.084
Madam, I regret to inform you
of General Lei's passing

46:01.376 --> 46:02.042
Please

46:02.751 --> 46:03.834
This way, Madam Lei

46:04.376 --> 46:06.376
Did your brother write back?

46:06.417 --> 46:07.417
No

46:07.459 --> 46:08.251
So

46:08.292 --> 46:10.709
do you know his geography teacher?

46:11.167 --> 46:12.167
No

46:12.251 --> 46:14.584
General Lei's body was never found

46:15.584 --> 46:18.917
His official status on record is "unknown"

46:19.626 --> 46:20.626
That's exactly why

46:21.834 --> 46:23.542
I must return to find him

46:24.042 --> 46:26.292
On what grounds do you prevent me from leaving?

46:26.334 --> 46:28.042
Why do you always go to Shanghai?

46:28.084 --> 46:30.417
I go to Shanghai to purchase medicine

46:30.459 --> 46:31.709
Please cooperate

46:31.959 --> 46:33.292
and remain in Taiwan for the time being

46:33.334 --> 46:34.126
Why?

46:34.167 --> 46:36.167
Some soldiers in his unit defected to the enemy

46:36.376 --> 46:37.917
We are still investigating

46:37.959 --> 46:40.667
Who was Zeming in contact with in Shanghai?

46:40.876 --> 46:41.876
I don't know

46:41.917 --> 46:43.709
Did he take part in any political activities?

46:43.751 --> 46:44.751
No

46:45.417 --> 46:46.501
We are aware

46:46.542 --> 46:47.542
that after the unit broke out

46:47.584 --> 46:48.959
General Qiu committed suicide

46:49.001 --> 46:50.917
and Deputy Commander Du was taken prisoner

46:51.126 --> 46:54.209
But only General Lei is unaccounted for

46:54.251 --> 46:56.126
You elder brother was a Communist

46:56.167 --> 46:57.792
You were in the Imperial Japanese Army

46:57.834 --> 46:59.834
Your younger brother has now fled to Shanghai

46:59.876 --> 47:01.209
And you're saying you don't know anything

47:01.251 --> 47:02.251
and haven't done anything?

47:02.292 --> 47:04.834
We need to further investigate

47:04.876 --> 47:06.667
all his communication with his family

47:06.709 --> 47:08.084
Such as his letters, for example

47:08.126 --> 47:09.542
My husband

47:09.834 --> 47:11.376
would never surrender

47:12.001 --> 47:12.959
I have not

47:13.001 --> 47:14.501
None of you understand

47:56.417 --> 47:58.167
If you keep turning like this

47:58.209 --> 47:59.459
we're going to crash into a tree

48:31.292 --> 48:33.001
You're like this orchid

48:33.542 --> 48:34.834
Three years

48:35.459 --> 48:37.084
It's still so beautiful

48:37.209 --> 48:38.584
and strong

48:39.917 --> 48:42.376
Wherever you plant it

48:42.626 --> 48:44.001
it will grow beautifully

49:03.042 --> 49:04.209
Yunfen

49:05.042 --> 49:06.209
You have to let go

49:07.459 --> 49:08.917
If you don't let go

49:09.209 --> 49:12.751
your love for him will eventually become a burden

49:13.209 --> 49:14.417
Ma

49:15.376 --> 49:17.292
Have you never been afraid?

49:17.959 --> 49:19.709
Ever since I can remember

49:20.167 --> 49:22.126
China has been at war

49:23.042 --> 49:25.959
First, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing

49:26.334 --> 49:29.292
Then it was the warlords

49:30.251 --> 49:33.001
That year, your grandmother, with bound feet

49:34.084 --> 49:36.251
took her whole family

49:36.626 --> 49:39.834
and fled from Tianjin to Shanghai

49:44.834 --> 49:48.126
She was never afraid

49:49.084 --> 49:50.584
She always asked

49:53.667 --> 49:57.334
when there would finally be peace

49:58.126 --> 50:01.917
Two of her sons died as revolutionaries

50:02.501 --> 50:04.251
They had their heads cut off

50:05.709 --> 50:08.709
Your grandmother personally went
to claim their bodies

50:11.459 --> 50:12.917
Yunfen

50:13.751 --> 50:16.042
I'm not afraid of anything

50:16.501 --> 50:18.834
except that you might lose courage

50:23.542 --> 50:24.542
Ma

50:25.584 --> 50:26.834
You're very brave too

50:33.126 --> 50:36.334
Don't lose faith

51:37.792 --> 51:39.459
Is that Zeming?

51:43.251 --> 51:44.292
Mother

51:44.959 --> 51:46.792
That's not him. That's someone else

51:52.751 --> 51:54.417
Mother, don't worry

51:55.042 --> 51:56.542
I'll bring Zeming back

52:25.459 --> 52:26.542
Please take care of mother

52:27.084 --> 52:29.459
I will, don't worry

52:44.042 --> 52:45.459
Don't cry

52:47.584 --> 52:48.709
Mother

52:49.584 --> 52:50.792
Take your medicine

53:09.751 --> 53:10.917
I'm leaving shortly

53:10.959 --> 53:12.417
for Shanghai

53:12.709 --> 53:13.584
Here

53:13.626 --> 53:15.917
This is some medicine for the baby

53:16.167 --> 53:18.001
If you have any problems

53:18.042 --> 53:19.876
you can look up my mother and sister-in-law

53:20.626 --> 53:22.042
Thank you

53:26.084 --> 53:28.292
I saw you at police headquarters that day

53:29.084 --> 53:31.251
Is there any news about General Lei?

53:32.917 --> 53:34.292
"Status Unknown"

53:34.876 --> 53:36.709
He's still under suspicion

53:48.751 --> 53:49.792
So that's him

53:51.959 --> 53:53.126
I've met him before

53:55.542 --> 53:57.792
At the battle of Shenjiagou

53:58.876 --> 54:00.459
I was captured and taken to his command tent

54:00.751 --> 54:02.084
My doctor was blown to pieces

54:05.417 --> 54:07.042
I hear you're a good doctor

54:07.917 --> 54:09.292
Just have me walking by tomorrow

54:18.542 --> 54:20.251
You're a Japanese soldier from Taiwan?

54:21.959 --> 54:23.501
So what's your Japanese name?

54:23.834 --> 54:25.709
I don't have a Japanese name

54:26.001 --> 54:27.209
So what should I call you

54:27.751 --> 54:30.167
Yan. Yan Zekun

54:30.626 --> 54:31.584
Sorry

54:33.084 --> 54:34.792
Looks like we misunderstand each other

54:35.001 --> 54:37.084
In Taiwan we are second class citizens

54:37.917 --> 54:40.001
When they started their war

54:40.501 --> 54:41.834
we got dragged into it as well

54:43.751 --> 54:46.376
I'm afraid I might have to amputate your leg

54:46.959 --> 54:49.459
There's a bullet lodged inside your femur

54:49.501 --> 54:51.126
and your whole leg is infected

54:51.792 --> 54:52.792
If I do not amputate

54:55.292 --> 54:56.542
If you dare to cut my leg off

54:57.917 --> 54:59.251
I will shoot you

55:01.501 --> 55:02.667
But like this

55:04.792 --> 55:06.251
you will spend the rest of your life in pain

55:06.959 --> 55:09.417
I cannot bear to lose my leg

55:10.584 --> 55:11.751
Then I must trouble you

55:12.417 --> 55:14.042
to put your gun away

55:15.584 --> 55:17.709
I do not like to be treated like the enemy

55:28.459 --> 55:29.626
He was very persistent

55:30.334 --> 55:32.584
He demanded perfection from everything in life

55:35.501 --> 55:37.042
My shoes are a size too small

55:37.459 --> 55:38.626
and my feet hurt

55:38.917 --> 55:39.834
No problem

55:40.417 --> 55:41.917
My leg is not too good either

55:52.417 --> 55:54.876
I met him at a dance

55:56.042 --> 55:56.876
If it weren't for you

55:58.126 --> 55:59.626
we wouldn't have met

56:00.292 --> 56:01.542
It's fate then

56:02.459 --> 56:03.584
Sadly

56:05.209 --> 56:07.334
I now only have this unborn child

56:08.501 --> 56:10.042
as the only

56:10.334 --> 56:12.209
link between us

56:16.042 --> 56:17.376
No matter how hard it is

56:17.542 --> 56:18.792
you must have the child safely

56:20.251 --> 56:22.542
As long as the child is here, he will be here

56:24.876 --> 56:26.167
Yes, doctor

56:26.876 --> 56:27.876
Let me show you something

56:35.792 --> 56:38.834
Paper cranes represent your thoughts

56:39.709 --> 56:40.834
Fold one

56:40.876 --> 56:42.417
and it will convey your well wishes to him

56:46.834 --> 56:48.209
I've finished the song

56:50.084 --> 56:50.834
Have a seat

56:51.251 --> 56:52.376
I'll play it for you

56:54.584 --> 56:55.584
Now that the song is done

56:56.251 --> 56:57.667
I feel free

56:57.709 --> 56:59.334
I hope you can feel the same too

58:18.334 --> 58:19.626
Peace, not war!

58:21.459 --> 58:23.334
End hunger! Stop civil war!

58:23.501 --> 58:25.584
Peace, not war!

58:27.084 --> 58:28.251
Students

58:28.292 --> 58:32.292
You are disrupting public order

58:49.751 --> 58:51.042
I'm not leaving

58:52.792 --> 58:54.126
I don't want to run anymore

58:54.501 --> 58:56.417
Nanjing has given the orders to evacuate

58:56.584 --> 58:58.626
It's almost impossible to get a boat ticket

58:59.084 --> 59:00.917
but I managed to get two

59:01.042 --> 59:02.292
If we leave, Nanny comes with us

59:02.626 --> 59:03.876
Don't worry about me

59:04.001 --> 59:05.584
I can go back home

59:06.126 --> 59:07.084
It'll be fine

59:13.001 --> 59:15.042
It's alright

59:16.084 --> 59:18.584
It's okay

59:33.917 --> 59:36.417
End hunger! Stop civil war!

59:39.084 --> 59:42.751
Oppose Fascism!

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:07.376
Peace, not war!

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:08.959
Down with oppression! Oppose hunger!

01:00:09.001 --> 01:00:11.126
I've been looking all over for you

01:00:11.959 --> 01:00:12.876
Let's go

01:00:16.084 --> 01:00:17.376
Why are you here?

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:20.376
My father says
the situation in Shanghai is getting worse

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:21.626
We can't stay here any longer

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.292
He's asked us to go with him to Taiwan

01:00:28.126 --> 01:00:29.334
You go

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.042
I can't go

01:00:51.834 --> 01:00:53.334
Peace, not war!

01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:55.501
End oppression! End hunger!

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.001
Peace, not war!

01:00:57.042 --> 01:00:58.501
End oppression! End hunger!

01:01:23.209 --> 01:01:24.626
Mr. Yuan

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:26.584
You can't load any more

01:01:26.876 --> 01:01:29.334
The cargo hold is already full with your steel

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:31.459
The ship is seriously overloaded

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:35.834
Why, isn't it Mr. Wu the conductor?

01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:37.667
You've come too

01:01:37.751 --> 01:01:40.334
My wife and children went two days ago

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:42.251
They're waiting for me
to join them for the New Year

01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:43.459
Happy New Year

01:01:45.751 --> 01:01:46.959
Let them come in

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:47.834
Uncle

01:01:47.876 --> 01:01:48.876
You're finally here

01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:50.876
Lechang and his wife are on their way

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:52.876
I've arranged for someone to receive them

01:02:00.792 --> 01:02:01.917
I really envy you

01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:04.542
I envy the relationship you have with General Lei

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:06.376
You have Zekun

01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:09.501
It was my mother-in-law who made me marry him

01:02:11.917 --> 01:02:13.251
I can understand

01:02:13.876 --> 01:02:14.751
It's just that

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:18.876
I hope Zekun won't have to suffer anymore

01:02:20.209 --> 01:02:21.334
What about yourself?

01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:22.834
Don't you suffer as well?

01:02:24.542 --> 01:02:26.751
I have nothing to complain about

01:02:30.001 --> 01:02:30.876
Yunfen

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:32.709
What do you think of this dress?

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:33.417
Pretty?

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.126
It's great

01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:36.459
You look gorgeous

01:02:36.501 --> 01:02:37.334
Thank you

01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:40.584
I'll wear this to meet your father

01:02:40.626 --> 01:02:42.126
He likes this dress the most

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:57.626
The ship is already overloaded

01:02:58.126 --> 01:02:59.251
It's overloaded

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:00.042
Injured soldiers get priority

01:03:00.084 --> 01:03:01.501
Everyone please give way

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:02.501
Gentlemen

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:04.876
The ship is already full

01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:06.626
Perhaps you can take your boys

01:03:06.709 --> 01:03:08.584
to the foredeck, okay?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.542
Yu Zhen

01:03:19.584 --> 01:03:20.501
Yu Zhen

01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:24.667
Yu Zhen

01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:26.917
What brings you here?

01:03:30.459 --> 01:03:31.459
Let me ask you

01:03:31.501 --> 01:03:32.584
Do you still want to go to Taiwan?

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.209
Of course

01:03:35.459 --> 01:03:36.376
Good

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.917
Then you better get going soon

01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:40.292
Everyone says Shanghai won't last much longer

01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:42.459
Take this boat ticket

01:03:43.667 --> 01:03:45.042
How did you manage to get this?

01:03:45.084 --> 01:03:46.501
My sugar daddy wants me

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:49.042
to join him in Taiwan as his mistress

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.417
I couldn't care less for that

01:03:51.334 --> 01:03:52.501
I

01:03:55.042 --> 01:03:56.376
I'm leaving with him

01:03:56.501 --> 01:03:59.209
and going to Yunnan with General Li Mi's army

01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:03.417
Yu Zhen

01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:06.167
I sincerely hope

01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:08.959
that you'll find that person

01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:10.459
in Taiwan

01:04:14.834 --> 01:04:17.167
The ship is setting sail soon, you'd better hurry

01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:20.667
Here

01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:23.001
Put this on

01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:32.126
Remember

01:04:33.292 --> 01:04:34.626
You must stay strong

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:36.792
and live on

01:04:51.792 --> 01:04:52.917
I'm leaving now

01:04:54.376 --> 01:04:55.584
Take good care

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.501
I will

01:05:18.792 --> 01:05:19.542
Mister

01:05:19.626 --> 01:05:20.792
Help me return this

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.209
I'm going

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:23.167
Going?

01:05:28.126 --> 01:05:28.876
Thank you

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.334
Take care

01:05:32.876 --> 01:05:35.792
Take down the deceased's unit and name

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:38.584
The deceased belongs to the

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:42.209
7th division 9th brigade
55th battalion 8th company

01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:43.209
Yang Tianhu

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:02.751
We have tickets

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.251
I'm from General Staff Headquarters

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.501
Mama, where are we going?

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:08.709
To Taiwan

01:06:08.876 --> 01:06:10.417
Why?

01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:11.917
We're moving to a new house

01:06:11.959 --> 01:06:13.292
Stop asking so many questions

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:14.834
Hold on to me and don't get lost

01:06:20.459 --> 01:06:21.459
Is it here?

01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:22.459
It's here alright

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:23.417
Excuse me

01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:28.709
What's going on here?

01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:31.334
This is the governor of Liaoning province

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:33.251
They decided to leave at the last minute

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:34.459
so it was a bit of a rush

01:06:34.501 --> 01:06:36.917
We can all squeeze a little if you don't mind

01:06:38.334 --> 01:06:39.959
Sure, It's alright

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:41.501
We need to recruit more people

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:45.126
Look, our schoolmates all over there

01:06:59.334 --> 01:07:00.001
Zeming

01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:02.042
It's okay, it's my brother

01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:03.876
Come

01:07:05.876 --> 01:07:07.167
Zenkun, why are you here?

01:07:07.667 --> 01:07:08.876
How did you find me?

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.584
I figured if you came to Shanghai

01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:12.834
you'd come to the student union headquarters

01:07:12.959 --> 01:07:14.251
Did Mother ask you to come?

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:16.001
I came on my own

01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:17.542
Zeming

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:19.209
Mother is sick

01:07:21.292 --> 01:07:22.959
I can't go home with you

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.417
I understand

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:28.001
But she's in critical condition

01:07:29.876 --> 01:07:33.334
Do you remember what Father once said

01:07:34.292 --> 01:07:36.167
One must be like the nightingale

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:38.334
The darker the night

01:07:39.042 --> 01:07:40.626
the sweeter its song

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:44.667
Father's ideals

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:46.417
all went unfulfilled

01:07:47.334 --> 01:07:49.334
I believe that as long as we persevere

01:07:49.917 --> 01:07:51.376
we can achieve all of those ideals

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:53.126
How many more lives must be sacrificed

01:07:53.667 --> 01:07:54.376
Our eldest brother was...

01:07:54.417 --> 01:07:56.001
His sacrifice was not in vain

01:07:58.167 --> 01:08:00.251
Who else will fight for this society?

01:08:01.501 --> 01:08:03.126
- Zeming
- Zekun

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:07.376
You should do something meaningful as well

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:09.792
What do you mean?

01:08:10.126 --> 01:08:12.417
You only care about your personal happiness

01:08:12.876 --> 01:08:13.959
You're too selfish

01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:14.792
and too weak

01:08:14.834 --> 01:08:16.084
I'm not!

01:08:17.251 --> 01:08:19.292
It's not that I don't want to live my own life

01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:21.917
but when did I ever get the chance?

01:08:26.959 --> 01:08:28.959
I'm not the brother you think I am

01:08:30.876 --> 01:08:34.084
You don't understand the things I've had to do

01:08:35.959 --> 01:08:37.792
I want you to know

01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:41.126
that I have ideals too

01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.917
They're for our family

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:50.042
Zeming

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.334
It's great to have ideals

01:08:52.876 --> 01:08:55.667
I'm happy you found your mission in life

01:08:56.626 --> 01:08:58.959
and can lead the life you want to lead

01:08:59.084 --> 01:09:01.084
and do the things you want to do

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:06.084
But Zeming

01:09:06.126 --> 01:09:07.709
Mother is really ill

01:09:09.459 --> 01:09:10.584
So I'm begging you

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:12.376
to come home with me just this once

01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:14.334
until she gets better, okay?

01:09:19.959 --> 01:09:24.334
Tomorrow I'm going into the liberated zone

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:29.417
If you don't return now

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.459
after the New Year

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.376
everyone will know you are a Communist

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:35.917
Then, even if you want to go home

01:09:35.959 --> 01:09:37.167
it won't be possible

01:09:42.584 --> 01:09:45.834
Just come back with me first, okay?

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:56.584
Mama I'm scared

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:58.584
There's nothing to be scared of

01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:02.167
We're together as a family

01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:04.001
we don't have to fear anything

01:10:07.001 --> 01:10:08.126
No need to worry

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:09.626
Everything will be fine

01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:12.417
I'll go get some water

01:10:25.209 --> 01:10:26.209
Stay put here

01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:41.376
Yu Zhen

01:10:42.376 --> 01:10:43.584
Sorry

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.834
- Mrs. Gu
- Yu Zhen

01:11:00.376 --> 01:11:01.209
I never thought

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:03.042
you'd be here as well

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:04.626
Where are the kids?

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.376
They're with their father

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:07.584
The whole family is here

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:10.917
That's great

01:11:15.126 --> 01:11:16.542
Please help me take a look

01:11:16.584 --> 01:11:18.167
I don't know where my bunk is

01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:20.709
Here, come with me

01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:29.126
Shut the gates! Don't let them in!

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:32.834
Why aren't there any tickets?

01:11:39.334 --> 01:11:40.542
It's here

01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:47.459
We're over there

01:11:47.501 --> 01:11:48.959
Just holler if you need anything

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:56.459
What are you doing here?

01:11:57.334 --> 01:11:59.334
Didn't think I'd eventually

01:11:59.876 --> 01:12:01.667
still get the ticket from you

01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:04.126
Where is Xia Shan?

01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:05.376
She just got married

01:12:07.126 --> 01:12:09.584
She doesn't want to be your mistress in Taiwan

01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:12.876
Dumb bitch

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:15.209
She'll regret it

01:12:25.084 --> 01:12:25.667
Stop!

01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:28.751
Zeming, hurry up!

01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:33.709
We have tickets

01:12:34.167 --> 01:12:35.042
We have tickets

01:12:37.001 --> 01:12:38.334
Stop boarding!

01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:39.792
We're full! Stop!

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:56.459
Stop boarding!

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:03.459
We're setting sail, stop boarding

01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:06.751
Zekun

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:08.584
Zeming, hurry

01:13:18.292 --> 01:13:21.709
Stop pushing! The ship is full!

01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:45.042
Zeming

01:13:46.209 --> 01:13:47.501
Zekun

01:13:48.959 --> 01:13:49.917
I'm sorry

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:54.209
Mother

01:13:55.626 --> 01:13:57.084
Please forgive me

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.334
We departed late

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:56.584
We'll run into the coast guard for sure

01:14:57.209 --> 01:15:00.376
We'll be alright once we reach open sea

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:03.001
To avoid being intercepted

01:15:03.376 --> 01:15:04.542
turn off all lights

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.167
Lights out

01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:09.626
Lights out

01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:17.501
"KEELUNG PORT"

01:15:35.042 --> 01:15:36.251
Yunfen

01:15:36.459 --> 01:15:37.667
Ma!

01:15:37.876 --> 01:15:38.667
Yunfen!

01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:39.584
Ma!

01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:41.417
The house isn't safe, we must leave

01:15:41.459 --> 01:15:43.084
The storm is getting stronger

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:43.876
Where are we going?

01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:45.501
Quick, let's get out of here

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.042
Be careful

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:56.001
Get up

01:15:57.167 --> 01:15:58.542
Miss

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:07.751
Be careful

01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:16.584
- It hurts
- The baby may be injured

01:16:16.959 --> 01:16:18.876
My belly hurts

01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:21.251
This is not good

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.751
We'd better go find my mother and get help

01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:27.334
Come, be careful

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:33.334
You guys go first, I'll check on Mr. Guo

01:16:51.042 --> 01:16:52.042
Yunfen

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.042
We're almost there

01:16:54.584 --> 01:16:55.917
Don't worry

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:14.167
Help! Somebody help!

01:17:26.626 --> 01:17:29.334
Mother! Open up! Mother!

01:17:29.501 --> 01:17:30.459
Coming

01:17:31.834 --> 01:17:33.251
What happened?

01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:34.126
The baby may be injured

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:35.667
Come in quickly

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:55.167
- Happy new year
- Same to you

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:01.959
One

01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:02.626
Two

01:18:02.667 --> 01:18:03.376
Three

01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:12.126
It's the New Year!

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:51.667
Those bygone days have turned light blue

01:18:53.042 --> 01:18:56.751
When I look into the distant sea I think of death

01:18:57.792 --> 01:19:02.292
I kneel silently by the sea

01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:06.084
And remember the other shore

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.417
I am alone

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:09.792
All alone

01:19:18.626 --> 01:19:21.417
- Eat more
- It's delicious

01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:25.251
Happy New Year

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:26.917
Everybody have some buns

01:19:27.959 --> 01:19:29.126
There's enough for everyone, no need to rush

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:30.042
I have a...

01:19:30.084 --> 01:19:31.417
Happy New Year

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.251
Drink...

01:19:33.292 --> 01:19:35.167
My shift's almost over, it's your turn

01:19:35.792 --> 01:19:36.751
It's time?

01:19:38.626 --> 01:19:40.876
There's still five more minutes!

01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:41.751
I need to use the bathroom

01:19:41.792 --> 01:19:42.501
Well hold it in!

01:19:44.959 --> 01:19:45.667
Uncle

01:19:45.917 --> 01:19:49.667
I heard the central bank moved its gold reserves...

01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:51.251
...onto this ship. Is it true?

01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:54.834
At a time like this

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:56.584
none of that is important

01:19:58.042 --> 01:19:59.209
This time round

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:01.001
no one knows when

01:20:01.292 --> 01:20:04.376
my family can return to Shanghai and start anew

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:16.167
Actually

01:20:16.751 --> 01:20:18.417
You should have told us about your problems

01:20:19.459 --> 01:20:21.334
How could I?

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:25.501
When we get to Taiwan,
I'll ask my husband to ask around

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:28.376
Maybe he can find Yang Tianhu

01:20:30.001 --> 01:20:31.376
Thank you so much

01:20:31.417 --> 01:20:33.292
Don't give up too easily

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:34.792
Being a soldier is like that

01:20:35.334 --> 01:20:36.876
When war breaks out, you follow your orders

01:20:37.042 --> 01:20:38.084
When war ends

01:20:38.126 --> 01:20:39.376
you follow your fate

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.667
Who knows?

01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:42.376
Maybe he's using this opportunity

01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:44.167
to look for you too

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.084
Sir

01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:25.334
Excuse me, but do you know

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:26.709
where the injured soldiers are?

01:21:26.792 --> 01:21:28.126
I think they're up front

01:21:29.626 --> 01:21:30.667
Thank you

01:21:41.334 --> 01:21:42.792
It's New Year's Eve tonight

01:21:42.834 --> 01:21:45.292
Come get something to eat and celebrate

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:46.667
Have some warm tea

01:21:47.126 --> 01:21:49.292
Thanks

01:21:50.001 --> 01:21:51.542
Come

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:55.001
Does anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:57.001
Yang Tianhu, anyone know him?

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:58.417
Which unit is he in?

01:21:58.501 --> 01:21:59.834
9th Brigade, 55th Regiment

01:22:00.209 --> 01:22:02.042
I heard the 9th Brigade was wiped out

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.042
We're the 53rd Brigade

01:22:07.917 --> 01:22:10.001
Do you know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:11.376 --> 01:22:12.959
Do you know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:14.876
Yang Tianhu of the 7th Division...

01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:17.626
9th Brigade, 55th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 8th Company

01:22:17.876 --> 01:22:18.792
Do you know him?

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.251
Does anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:23.251 --> 01:22:24.792
Does anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:25.084 --> 01:22:26.126
Anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:30.001
Anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:31.459 --> 01:22:32.792
Anyone know Yang Tianhu?

01:22:59.876 --> 01:23:00.542
Anyone there?

01:23:00.792 --> 01:23:02.667
Quick, help me find my wife's photo

01:23:05.959 --> 01:23:07.251
Anyone there?

01:23:07.292 --> 01:23:08.084
Who can help me?

01:23:08.126 --> 01:23:10.417
Who's seen my wife's photo?

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:13.001
Anyone?

01:23:13.126 --> 01:23:15.584
Who's seen the photo of my wife?

01:23:16.042 --> 01:23:17.417
Has anyone seen it

01:23:17.876 --> 01:23:18.792
Is this it?

01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:21.376
Thanks

01:23:21.792 --> 01:23:23.334
Do you know Yang Tianhu?

01:23:29.084 --> 01:23:31.084
You sound a lot like my wife

01:23:32.167 --> 01:23:33.501
This is my wife

01:23:34.126 --> 01:23:36.417
Her voice is as beautiful as yours

01:23:37.126 --> 01:23:38.751
Especially when she says

01:23:39.376 --> 01:23:40.626
You

01:23:48.876 --> 01:23:50.334
This is your wife?

01:23:52.751 --> 01:23:54.084
Yes, my wife

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.084
Can you say what she's like?

01:24:01.584 --> 01:24:03.417
This is embarrassing but

01:24:04.251 --> 01:24:05.042
well

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:08.667
We're from the same village

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:10.751
We grew up together

01:24:11.126 --> 01:24:13.126
She's gorgeous and fair

01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:14.667
And she's wonderful to me

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:17.959
When she smiles, she has three dimples

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:19.501
One on the left and two on the right

01:24:21.292 --> 01:24:22.834
I've struggled so hard to stay alive

01:24:23.167 --> 01:24:24.501
because of her

01:24:24.834 --> 01:24:27.876
She told me that I must stay alive

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.959
But on this ship

01:24:32.084 --> 01:24:34.667
who knows when we'll meet again?

01:24:45.209 --> 01:24:47.042
Is your unit designation

01:24:48.209 --> 01:24:51.667
Army 14th Division, 8th Brigade

01:24:52.376 --> 01:24:54.876
53th Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 7th Company

01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.709
Are you Tong Daqing?

01:25:01.042 --> 01:25:02.084
How do you know?

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:37.501
Have you used up all your salt?

01:25:53.334 --> 01:25:56.334
Wait, how come there are no dimples?

01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:58.501
Can you see me clearly?

01:25:59.292 --> 01:26:00.334
I'm Yu Zhen

01:26:01.042 --> 01:26:02.042
Do you remember?

01:26:03.376 --> 01:26:04.417
My last name is "Yu"

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:05.876
and "Zhen" as in innocent

01:26:06.376 --> 01:26:08.292
I only know how to write these two words

01:26:10.001 --> 01:26:11.001
I'm not dreaming, am I?

01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:12.167
Tong Daqing!

01:26:13.876 --> 01:26:14.792
It's me

01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:22.001
I never thought we'd meet again

01:26:22.834 --> 01:26:24.376
I've tried so hard to stay alive

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:27.251
just so I could see you again, it's true

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:28.959
This is not a dream

01:26:30.042 --> 01:26:31.584
It's real

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:48.501
An An

01:27:49.042 --> 01:27:50.126
Huiyun

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:51.501
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine

01:27:51.542 --> 01:27:53.334
An An

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.376
What happened?

01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:55.292
I don't know

01:27:55.334 --> 01:27:57.042
Think we ran into something

01:28:01.459 --> 01:28:03.251
Full speed astern

01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:05.292
Full astern

01:28:05.334 --> 01:28:06.334
Get lost

01:28:06.667 --> 01:28:08.959
Full astern

01:28:10.417 --> 01:28:12.876
Full astern

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.584
Rescue all survivors

01:29:02.876 --> 01:29:05.001
Check for survivors

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:10.959
Come and help me

01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:19.334
My...

01:29:19.626 --> 01:29:20.959
My notebook is gone

01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:22.167
What notebook?

01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:23.292
That's my final mission

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:25.792
Don't panic, I'll help you find it

01:29:25.834 --> 01:29:27.209
It's a green canvas notebook

01:29:27.834 --> 01:29:30.751
- An An
- Mama

01:29:30.876 --> 01:29:31.584
Ning Ning

01:29:31.626 --> 01:29:32.626
The notebook

01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:34.376
My notebook

01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:35.834
it's tied up with leather string

01:29:35.959 --> 01:29:37.167
My notebook

01:29:37.417 --> 01:29:38.459
Where is it?

01:29:38.626 --> 01:29:39.667
Is this it?

01:29:42.084 --> 01:29:42.917
Yu Zhen

01:29:43.292 --> 01:29:45.167
If anything should happen to me

01:29:45.251 --> 01:29:48.542
promise me that you'll deliver this to someone

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:49.626
You'll be alright

01:29:49.667 --> 01:29:50.959
Just put it away

01:29:51.834 --> 01:29:53.376
We'll all be alright

01:29:54.251 --> 01:29:55.042
Wait for me

01:29:55.376 --> 01:29:56.417
Where are you going?

01:29:57.042 --> 01:30:01.334
Lights on

01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:02.417
Are you still drunk?

01:30:02.459 --> 01:30:04.167
Go check on the hull immediately

01:30:04.209 --> 01:30:05.042
to see if there's any damage

01:30:05.084 --> 01:30:05.751
- On the double!
- Aye captain!

01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:17.751
I used to be a nurse

01:30:18.459 --> 01:30:19.334
That's great

01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:20.542
Help me apply pressure

01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:41.834
Captain

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:43.417
Hull structure appears intact

01:30:43.584 --> 01:30:45.292
Alright

01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:52.376
Forward bearing one zero eight

01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:54.251
Speed eight knots

01:31:01.751 --> 01:31:04.251
Cast off! We're fine

01:31:08.834 --> 01:31:10.042
Let's just keep going

01:31:19.042 --> 01:31:20.542
Our ship is perfectly fine

01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:24.376
We just collided with a small boat

01:31:24.459 --> 01:31:27.126
but we're still sailing normally

01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:29.584
Everyone please calm down

01:31:29.626 --> 01:31:31.209
Everything is under control

01:31:31.417 --> 01:31:34.501
Everything is fine, we're a big ship.

01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:37.876
Look, are we not proceeding as normal?

01:31:44.584 --> 01:31:45.876
Jia Jia

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:46.834
Jia Jia wake up

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:47.667
Come and help

01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:49.042
A child has fainted

01:31:49.376 --> 01:31:51.126
He seems to have stopped breathing

01:31:52.376 --> 01:31:53.876
Sir, please save my child

01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:17.876
Uncle

01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:19.584
This ship was built by Americans

01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:20.709
It'll be fine

01:32:20.917 --> 01:32:21.959
Don't worry!

01:32:48.959 --> 01:32:50.959
Everyone stay calm

01:32:51.209 --> 01:32:53.501
The crew has inspected the ship

01:32:54.209 --> 01:32:55.959
The ship did not sustain any damage

01:32:56.292 --> 01:32:57.876
It's very solid

01:33:07.084 --> 01:33:08.334
The ship's in trouble!

01:33:08.376 --> 01:33:10.001
Everyone get up on deck

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.084
The ship's in trouble!

01:33:11.126 --> 01:33:12.334
Everyone go up quickly

01:33:12.376 --> 01:33:13.459
Children wake up

01:33:13.876 --> 01:33:16.084
- Head up quickly
- Hurry

01:33:16.126 --> 01:33:16.626
Come on

01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:31.334
Go! Hurry up!

01:33:54.417 --> 01:33:55.792
Reduce speed

01:33:55.834 --> 01:33:56.709
Maintain bearings

01:33:58.876 --> 01:33:59.876
Where are the life jackets?

01:33:59.917 --> 01:34:00.876
Over there

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:09.626
Five degrees to port

01:34:10.042 --> 01:34:11.292
Port five degrees

01:34:11.751 --> 01:34:13.792
Lifeboat at the top

01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:14.959
Follow me

01:34:20.751 --> 01:34:21.959
Quick! Put it on

01:34:22.584 --> 01:34:23.626
Everyone maintain course

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:24.917
Two or three more nautical miles

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:25.876
and we'll reach Baijieshan

01:34:26.001 --> 01:34:26.876
Don't go in this direction

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:28.209
Head upward

01:34:30.084 --> 01:34:31.042
Go up

Mama

01:34:59.209 --> 01:35:00.001
Be careful

01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:01.001
The deck is slippery

01:35:01.126 --> 01:35:02.001
Give me two

01:35:05.959 --> 01:35:07.001
Captain

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.376
We're losing control

01:35:08.417 --> 01:35:09.542
The ship is out of control

01:35:09.584 --> 01:35:10.917
Send out an SOS

01:35:11.417 --> 01:35:12.792
Send out an SOS

01:35:26.501 --> 01:35:27.251

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:35.417

Hurry up

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:41.292
Put these on

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:43.876
Be careful

01:35:43.917 --> 01:35:44.917
Take care of the children

01:35:46.292 --> 01:35:47.334
Take care

01:35:58.417 --> 01:35:59.542
Mama

01:36:01.042 --> 01:36:02.459
How did we end up like this

01:36:03.626 --> 01:36:05.042
We've come all this way

01:36:05.584 --> 01:36:07.126
and endured every hardship

01:36:10.376 --> 01:36:11.959
An An, Ning Ning, don't be afraid

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:14.667
Whatever happens, just hold on tight to me

01:36:36.251 --> 01:36:37.501

01:37:13.792 --> 01:37:14.667
Take care!

01:37:15.626 --> 01:37:16.584
Thank you

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:21.751
Come on

Someone help me

01:37:56.667 --> 01:37:57.751
I feel like I've seen this man before

01:37:58.084 --> 01:37:59.542
Can he hold on?

01:38:00.459 --> 01:38:01.459
He's a good person

01:38:01.792 --> 01:38:03.251
He'll be rewarded

01:38:25.876 --> 01:38:27.584
We mustn't be separated again

01:38:28.126 --> 01:38:29.459
We must hold on

01:38:29.751 --> 01:38:31.001
We won't be separated

01:38:36.126 --> 01:38:37.042
Hold me

01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:11.917
Is anyone there?

01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:14.042
Help me

01:40:31.876 --> 01:40:33.334

01:40:45.417 --> 01:40:46.792

01:40:49.459 --> 01:40:51.042
Stay calm, don't panic

01:40:51.459 --> 01:40:52.709
Give me your hand

01:40:53.417 --> 01:40:53.959

01:42:35.251 --> 01:42:37.167
Girl, what's the matter?

01:42:37.209 --> 01:42:39.084
This man rescued me just now

01:42:39.126 --> 01:42:42.334
He's tired, I think he's sleeping

01:42:42.376 --> 01:42:43.042
Sir

01:42:43.584 --> 01:42:44.209
Sir

01:42:44.667 --> 01:42:45.251
Sir

01:42:45.667 --> 01:42:46.292
Wake up!

01:42:46.667 --> 01:42:47.292
Sir

01:42:50.876 --> 01:42:51.876
Stay awake

01:42:51.917 --> 01:42:53.292
You'll die if you fall asleep

01:42:54.417 --> 01:42:55.167
Thank you

01:42:55.959 --> 01:42:58.376
- What the...
- Give it to me!

01:42:58.876 --> 01:42:59.792
Give me the life buoy

01:43:01.417 --> 01:43:02.167
Stop fighting

01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:05.626
Stop

01:43:07.126 --> 01:43:07.751
What are you doing?

01:43:52.334 --> 01:43:54.334
Get lost!

01:44:12.417 --> 01:44:13.542
Ning Ning

01:44:15.126 --> 01:44:16.376
Ning Ning

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:18.501
Ning Ning

01:44:34.292 --> 01:44:35.292
Ning Ning

01:44:36.626 --> 01:44:37.584
Yu Zhen

01:44:37.959 --> 01:44:39.001
I'm here

01:44:39.834 --> 01:44:40.834
The child is here

01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:52.501
Don't touch my wife

01:45:08.292 --> 01:45:08.876
Be careful

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:16.834
Get the life jacket

01:45:23.084 --> 01:45:24.126
Don't touch my wife!

01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:54.042
Mister, I'm cold

01:45:54.167 --> 01:45:55.751
Don't sleep

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.292
What's your name?

01:45:59.542 --> 01:46:00.917
I'm Xiaowen

01:46:00.959 --> 01:46:03.209
But you won't remember me

01:46:04.209 --> 01:46:05.459
I will

01:46:06.251 --> 01:46:07.751
Be brave

01:46:08.292 --> 01:46:09.792
I'll remember you

01:46:11.542 --> 01:46:12.542
Mama

01:46:12.584 --> 01:46:13.792
- You're here
- Yu Zhen

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:14.834
Mama

01:46:20.167 --> 01:46:23.376
Papa

01:46:23.417 --> 01:46:24.501
An An

01:46:26.334 --> 01:46:27.126
An An

01:46:27.792 --> 01:46:29.459
Papa

01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:31.417
An An

01:46:32.042 --> 01:46:33.667
Papa

01:46:36.292 --> 01:46:38.876
- Papa
- Have you seen a child around her age?

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:40.542
- Papa
- No

01:46:42.126 --> 01:46:42.876
Papa

01:46:42.917 --> 01:46:44.001
This child is looking for her father

01:46:45.167 --> 01:46:49.084
Papa

01:46:49.209 --> 01:46:51.876
- Don't be afraid
- Papa

01:46:52.542 --> 01:46:53.959
Mama

01:46:54.626 --> 01:46:55.584
Go away

01:46:57.126 --> 01:46:58.084
Get lost...

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.667
Don't touch my wife!

01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:15.501
Don't touch... my wife!

01:47:20.292 --> 01:47:21.751
My notebook

01:47:25.626 --> 01:47:26.834
My notebook

01:47:27.126 --> 01:47:28.126
Watch the child

01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:57.542
Get lost!

01:47:59.626 --> 01:48:00.167
Get lost!

01:48:00.459 --> 01:48:01.001
Go away!

01:48:01.042 --> 01:48:01.959
Stop fighting

01:48:02.167 --> 01:48:03.876
This board is big enough for all of us

01:48:04.167 --> 01:48:05.876
I don't want to die!

01:48:06.417 --> 01:48:07.876
Nobody wants to die!

01:48:45.292 --> 01:48:46.251
It's alright

01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:00.292
Yu Zhen

01:49:03.667 --> 01:49:04.709
Yu Zhen

01:49:05.501 --> 01:49:06.501
Yu Zhen

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:10.459
Hold on

01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:14.542
Yu Zhen

01:49:20.834 --> 01:49:22.501
Yu Zhen, stay strong

01:49:38.876 --> 01:49:40.001
Hold on tight

01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:50.876
Where's the child?

01:49:52.334 --> 01:49:54.334
Miss

01:50:09.792 --> 01:50:10.834
Ning Ning!

01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:07.501
I miss Keelung

01:51:10.001 --> 01:51:14.751
I always imagine you by the sea

01:51:15.917 --> 01:51:22.459
I wish the sea would take me back

01:51:23.542 --> 01:51:30.209
Perhaps like this, we can meet once more

01:52:34.292 --> 01:52:36.959
Anyone still alive?

01:52:39.667 --> 01:52:42.292
We're coming!

01:53:02.126 --> 01:53:03.292
Yunfen

01:53:05.459 --> 01:53:07.542
The baby is fine

01:53:08.126 --> 01:53:09.751
You can stay here for a while

01:53:10.126 --> 01:53:12.584
You can't live there anymore

01:53:13.126 --> 01:53:14.542
Right mother?

01:53:20.667 --> 01:53:21.709
Thank you

01:53:28.376 --> 01:53:30.084
Whether or not General Lei met with...

01:53:30.126 --> 01:53:30.959
...Deputy Commander Liu, I don't know

01:53:31.501 --> 01:53:32.667
What I did see

01:53:32.917 --> 01:53:34.126
was that right until the very end

01:53:34.959 --> 01:53:36.709
General Lei did not waver

01:53:36.917 --> 01:53:40.584
Liu tried to persuade him to join the Communists

01:53:41.251 --> 01:53:42.542
This is an open secret

01:53:43.042 --> 01:53:45.334
General Lei was an honorable soldier

01:53:46.001 --> 01:53:49.251
He died after firing his last bullet

01:53:51.001 --> 01:53:52.376
Sergeant Tong Daqing

01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:55.001
Your testimony has been very clear

01:53:55.501 --> 01:53:56.542
Thank you

01:53:58.876 --> 01:53:59.584
Also

01:53:59.917 --> 01:54:01.501
General Lei's diary

01:54:01.709 --> 01:54:03.792
records in detail the progress of the war

01:54:04.084 --> 01:54:05.626
We will keep it as a reference

01:54:05.959 --> 01:54:06.709
Impossible!

01:54:07.001 --> 01:54:08.417
General Lei's final order to me

01:54:08.626 --> 01:54:10.876
was to hand his diary to his wife

01:54:11.126 --> 01:54:12.667
This is my mission!

01:55:30.376 --> 01:55:31.126
Madam

01:55:31.251 --> 01:55:32.876
I am signals soldier Tong Daqing

01:55:33.459 --> 01:55:35.084
General Lei instructed me to pass this to you

01:55:35.376 --> 01:55:38.501
With this I have accomplished my mission

01:55:55.917 --> 01:55:58.459
Until the very end

01:55:59.084 --> 01:56:01.084
General Lei's thoughts were always about you

01:56:06.084 --> 01:56:07.417
Are you with him?

01:56:09.417 --> 01:56:11.626
We were thrown together by fate

01:56:13.876 --> 01:56:14.792
Good day Madam

01:56:15.417 --> 01:56:16.542
I'm Yu Zhen

01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:19.209
This notebook was almost lost at sea

01:56:19.417 --> 01:56:21.292
but Miss Yu retrieved it for me

01:56:33.417 --> 01:56:34.792
It must have been tough

01:56:36.376 --> 01:56:37.501
Thank you

01:56:40.292 --> 01:56:41.501
That's great

01:56:42.126 --> 01:56:44.709
You're now free to go home

01:56:56.251 --> 01:56:57.709
This is my home

01:56:59.667 --> 01:57:01.292
Women of our times

01:57:01.667 --> 01:57:03.667
in order to raise a family

01:57:05.334 --> 01:57:06.792
seem almost destined

01:57:07.501 --> 01:57:08.667
to keep running

01:57:15.834 --> 01:57:16.751
You have

01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:20.751
You have

01:57:23.417 --> 01:57:24.667
My mother has

01:57:25.459 --> 01:57:27.001
I believe I have too

01:57:29.417 --> 01:57:31.126
Yifang once told me

01:57:32.959 --> 01:57:34.709
I am his home

01:57:36.751 --> 01:57:37.959
As long as I am around

01:57:39.084 --> 01:57:41.251
He can always find his way home

01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:46.042
Don't be afraid!

01:57:46.167 --> 01:57:49.126
Here, push! Use strength!

01:57:49.209 --> 01:57:50.876
Mom We are ready...

01:57:50.917 --> 01:57:52.334
Push!

01:57:53.292 --> 01:57:54.834
The birth of a child

01:57:55.334 --> 01:57:56.876
always makes one feel

01:57:57.209 --> 01:57:58.126
that everything

01:57:58.626 --> 01:58:00.917
can start anew

01:58:09.584 --> 01:58:10.917
What will you name him?

01:58:12.792 --> 01:58:14.959
Let's name him Taisheng (born in Taiwan)

01:58:18.584 --> 01:58:19.376
Yifang

01:58:20.251 --> 01:58:21.959
The boy has grown up quickly

01:58:22.292 --> 01:58:23.459
He's very healthy

01:58:24.209 --> 01:58:25.626
and has your temperament

01:58:27.334 --> 01:58:28.209
Don't worry

01:58:28.626 --> 01:58:29.626
He knows about you

01:58:30.042 --> 01:58:33.584
and all that has happened

01:58:35.167 --> 01:58:37.167
I always read to Taisheng from your diary

01:58:37.417 --> 01:58:39.292
and tell him stories about you

01:58:40.626 --> 01:58:42.417
and about us
