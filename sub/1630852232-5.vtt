WEBVTT

00:06.482 --> 00:08.310
JOHNNY: Java, come here.

00:08.379 --> 00:10.413
You need to let me know
if you want to come or not.

00:10.482 --> 00:11.896
What do you want to do?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.310
Do you want to go with, or do
you want to go in the cabin?

00:14.793 --> 00:17.103
All right, that's her answer.

00:17.689 --> 00:19.379
I'm going solo today.

00:20.413 --> 00:23.827
JOHNNY: I've gone ice fishing on
the lakes that surround my camp

00:23.896 --> 00:26.103
with no success.

00:26.551 --> 00:29.206
So, the goal is to get back
out on these lakes and I wanna

00:29.275 --> 00:30.862
try different methods.

00:31.206 --> 00:34.379
It's challenging to be
persistent and stay at it.

00:34.448 --> 00:38.310
There's no guarantees of
when and where your food is.

00:38.379 --> 00:41.620
But this point, failure
isn't an option.

00:42.137 --> 00:44.517
I'm finding my place within
the food chain and proving to

00:44.586 --> 00:46.379
the land that this
is where I belong.

00:53.931 --> 00:55.000
JOHNNY: So, I landed here,

00:55.068 --> 00:57.241
I'm about 200 yards
from the shore.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.793
And there's a little bit of
an inlet river

00:59.862 --> 01:01.551
that comes into this lake,

01:01.620 --> 01:03.965
and my understanding is
that a lot of migratory fish

01:04.034 --> 01:06.758
like to hang around
the mouths of rivers.

01:06.827 --> 01:09.758
So, I'm gonna try fishing
that mouth right here.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.206
JOHNNY: Instead of hovering
over just one hole and jigging,

01:13.275 --> 01:15.482
this time, I want
to put out lines that do

01:15.551 --> 01:16.758
the fishing for me.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.379
And they're called set lines.

01:18.448 --> 01:20.724
I think that's clear enough,
so I'm gonna start drilling a

01:20.793 --> 01:22.275
hole with an auger.

01:22.344 --> 01:24.344
The beauty is I can
set multiple of them.

01:24.413 --> 01:27.793
That way they're fishing
24 hours around the clock

01:27.862 --> 01:30.379
and you just wait for the fish
to come by, snag that bait,

01:30.448 --> 01:33.000
and hope that the fish will be
on the end of that line when

01:33.068 --> 01:35.000
you come back.

01:39.379 --> 01:42.793
So, I have cordage here,
and I also have a stick.

01:42.862 --> 01:44.620
And the plan here is
to make a set line.

01:44.689 --> 01:48.827
These fish eat off the bottom,
but nobody passes up a meal,

01:48.896 --> 01:50.310
especially out in this place.

01:50.448 --> 01:52.344
You know, everything out here
is just dying to live and

01:52.413 --> 01:54.379
hanging on to life.

01:55.068 --> 01:56.344
So, I'm just like them.

01:56.413 --> 01:57.482
Trying to get a meal.

01:59.689 --> 02:02.034
I got a lot more to set,
so I'm gonna work my way down

02:02.103 --> 02:05.034
towards shore and make
a lot more of these.

02:05.103 --> 02:07.620
There's multiple reasons why
catching a fish would be

02:07.689 --> 02:09.137
a huge success.

02:13.275 --> 02:15.586
So, to catch a nice,
oily, fatty fish

02:15.655 --> 02:17.896
and be able to
have that food source

02:17.965 --> 02:21.965
consistently throughout the
winter would be paramount.

02:22.034 --> 02:24.379
A very peculiar workout.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.758
They don't have
this at the gym.

02:28.379 --> 02:29.620
The other thing it's gonna do,

02:29.689 --> 02:31.034
it's gonna tell me the patterns,

02:31.103 --> 02:34.068
the movements, when they
feed, what they feed on.

02:34.137 --> 02:36.724
It's education because
I am new out here

02:36.793 --> 02:39.137
at trying to
track these fish down.

02:42.517 --> 02:45.000
[exhales heavily]

02:45.068 --> 02:47.620
Whew, that's what
I'm talking about.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.689
That's what I call a new man.

02:51.344 --> 02:54.000
Splash a bunch of cold water
on your face and you come out

02:54.068 --> 02:55.517
feeling like a new man.

02:55.586 --> 02:58.413
I don't know if it's something
I need to prove to myself,

02:58.482 --> 03:01.172
I don't know if it's something
I need to prove to the arctic,

03:01.689 --> 03:04.551
either way, I'm not coming
home until I have a fish.

03:14.896 --> 03:16.448
JESSI: Everybody
wants to succeed.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.344
And that's truly
all I want to do out here,

03:19.413 --> 03:20.689
is be successful.

03:21.413 --> 03:23.689
I want to do everything that
I can to live this lifestyle.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.000
[laughing]

03:33.620 --> 03:34.931
CHRIS: Awesome.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.655
Wow, this snow is really deep.

03:36.724 --> 03:39.000
JESSI: Yeah, it is.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.206
CHRIS: Well, I figure we're
headed in the right spot.

03:42.275 --> 03:44.655
I see where those two
hills come together,

03:44.724 --> 03:47.034
and we're supposed to follow
where the crack of where
those two hills

03:47.103 --> 03:50.034
come together and there should
be a totally vacant cabin.

03:50.758 --> 03:54.448
JESSI: Okay, so we need to go
right about that way, right?

03:54.517 --> 03:57.827
CHRIS: Yeah, there should be an
old trail that punches through.

03:57.896 --> 03:59.137
I'm not sure
exactly where it's--

03:59.206 --> 04:00.689
I mean it hasn't been
used in 40 or 50 years,

04:00.758 --> 04:03.172
so I'll probably just kinda go
up and down looking for a way

04:03.241 --> 04:05.689
to punch in and then we'll
just punch through the woods.

04:06.275 --> 04:07.655
JESSI: Okay.

04:07.724 --> 04:10.000
Try not to buck me off!

04:10.413 --> 04:12.724
CHRIS: It's been a pretty
piss-poor hunting season.

04:12.793 --> 04:15.413
We've hardly seen
anything for animals.

04:15.482 --> 04:18.206
The last time I was back
in town my dad told me that

04:18.275 --> 04:20.586
there's a six-sided cabin a
couple miles upriver from here

04:20.655 --> 04:22.413
from way back in the 70s.

04:22.482 --> 04:24.344
He said there's always
tons of moose sign,

04:24.413 --> 04:27.206
there's always beaver and lots
of stuff to trap out there.

04:27.275 --> 04:28.689
This could be a
wild goose chase,

04:28.758 --> 04:30.965
but at this point we
don't have an option.

04:31.034 --> 04:34.103
The only way to survive out
here is to push out farther.

04:34.551 --> 04:35.965
Look at all these
willow branches,

04:36.034 --> 04:37.413
they're all
chewed off up here.

04:37.482 --> 04:40.931
Let's pop up on top and just
kinda see what we can see.

04:42.172 --> 04:44.275
Wow, this is gonna be
tough to get up here, huh?

04:47.586 --> 04:50.000
Wow, holy moose
prints up here.

04:52.275 --> 04:55.482
Wow, check it out.

04:55.551 --> 04:58.275
All through here, wow.

04:58.344 --> 04:59.655
That's a really good sign.

04:59.724 --> 05:02.655
I haven't seen moose up
here in, like, five years.

05:02.724 --> 05:05.103
JESSI: This is super
promising, for sure.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.310
CHRIS: Dad said go up
to these lakes and that
there'd be moose.

05:07.379 --> 05:10.034
We're getting close and we're
already seeing moose sign.

05:10.103 --> 05:11.482
JESSI: Lots of moose sign,
and recent.

05:11.551 --> 05:12.724
CHRIS: Yeah.

05:12.793 --> 05:14.517
JESSI: I mean, the tracks
are maybe last week.

05:14.586 --> 05:18.310
These bites though, this
is really, really fresh.

05:18.379 --> 05:20.413
You can see that it's
like a light color.

05:20.482 --> 05:25.206
That one was just bit, so
he's still out here snacking.

05:25.275 --> 05:26.793
CHRIS: These moose
are close by.

05:26.862 --> 05:28.034
This is awesome. Good sign.

05:28.103 --> 05:30.241
JESSI: Yeah, this is fresh.

05:31.448 --> 05:35.034
With this bad, dismal trapping
season, it's been hard.

05:35.103 --> 05:37.655
Getting a moose out
here would be huge.

05:38.448 --> 05:41.000
CHRIS: Tracks go back up into
the woods as far as I can see.

05:41.068 --> 05:43.310
I see tracks all
the way back there.

05:43.379 --> 05:45.034
I wanna make sure
to mark this on my map

05:45.103 --> 05:46.655
when I get back down
to my snow machine.

05:46.724 --> 05:49.000
JESSI: Sounds good.

05:49.068 --> 05:52.517
It's like we're going on
a Cosna treasure hunt.

05:54.482 --> 05:56.517
ALEX: A lot of times people
wait until a disaster happens,

05:56.586 --> 05:58.206
and then they try
to do something.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.586
If I did things
that way out here,

05:59.655 --> 06:01.655
I'd probably be missing
some fingers and toes,

06:01.724 --> 06:03.931
or maybe not be here, at all.

06:13.137 --> 06:15.758
ALEX: Got some
food for birds here.

06:15.827 --> 06:18.448
This is just the leftovers
of that pike I cooked,

06:18.517 --> 06:20.793
I figured the birds or
whatever can have it.

06:20.862 --> 06:23.517
But I won't be doing this
for very much longer,

06:23.586 --> 06:26.172
uh, because this will
attract bears.

06:26.241 --> 06:28.827
Pretty soon, they'll be
coming out of hibernation

06:28.896 --> 06:31.655
and then, uh, when they do,

06:31.724 --> 06:34.000
this kind of thing would
bring bears from, for miles.

06:34.068 --> 06:36.241
So, it's not something
I'm gonna put off until
the last minute.

06:36.310 --> 06:37.793
I have to take care of it now.

06:38.586 --> 06:40.655
ALEX: The sun's
getting higher in the sky,

06:40.724 --> 06:43.172
the days are getting warmer,
and pretty soon all the bears

06:43.241 --> 06:45.689
that are hibernating right
now are gonna be coming out.

06:45.758 --> 06:47.275
And they're gonna be hungry.

06:47.344 --> 06:50.275
So, what I want to do is make
a platform and get the food

06:50.344 --> 06:53.793
stored high up in the trees
where bears can't get to it.

06:55.965 --> 06:59.965
Yeah, these small-sized spruce
trees, I use for everything.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.344
Today, I'm using them
for something new though.

07:02.413 --> 07:04.482
Something I haven't
done before.

07:04.931 --> 07:06.482
In order to get my food up in
the air,

07:06.551 --> 07:08.344
I'm gonna need to get
myself up in the air.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.758
So, the first thing I'm gonna
do is make myself a ladder.

07:11.482 --> 07:12.724
There we go.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.068
So that's gonna be a good
part of my ladder there.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.103
I'll do my best to make
it as sturdy as I can,

07:20.172 --> 07:23.344
but it won't be as dangerous
as if I got a hungry bear

07:23.413 --> 07:26.517
snooping around my camp, so,
just gotta do what I gotta do.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.172
At Bear Creek,
I had a little more security

07:30.241 --> 07:32.206
because I built
the cabin out there.

07:32.275 --> 07:34.275
But here I'm just in a tent.

07:34.344 --> 07:36.275
The only thing separating me
from a bear is

07:36.344 --> 07:39.137
a very thin fabric that he can
just claw right through.

07:39.206 --> 07:41.379
I'd rather not have one
tear through my wall at night

07:41.448 --> 07:44.275
and say hello,
because at that point,

07:44.344 --> 07:46.103
you know one way or another,
someone's gonna die.

07:48.344 --> 07:51.206
Okay, that should be everything
I need for my ladder.

07:51.275 --> 07:53.137
So, I'll just start
getting to work.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.068
This is my way of kind of
having a little treaty

07:55.137 --> 07:56.551
with the bears, you know?

07:56.620 --> 07:58.965
I'm not gonna put down anything
that's gonna tempt you,

07:59.034 --> 08:01.137
and then you don't
come around sniffing around.

08:01.206 --> 08:04.413
Okay, all I gotta do is do
that ten more times now.

08:04.482 --> 08:08.655
This is the same--
same cord I, that held
parachutes together.

08:08.724 --> 08:10.896
That I jumped down with
when I was in the army, so.

08:10.965 --> 08:14.862
If we could just avoid going
to war with each other then,

08:14.931 --> 08:17.000
you know, everyone's
gonna have an easier life.

08:21.655 --> 08:22.896
[grunts]

08:35.172 --> 08:36.241
Well, it's not the most
dangerous thing

08:36.310 --> 08:39.931
I've ever climbed,
but it's probably close.

08:48.379 --> 08:50.241
BRITTANY: Wherever you live,
you tend to learn

08:50.310 --> 08:52.965
the survival of that area.

08:53.034 --> 08:54.344
It's no different than here.

08:54.413 --> 08:57.206
We learn what we
have to do to survive

08:57.275 --> 08:59.000
in the environment
that we are in.

09:02.379 --> 09:03.551
Hello!

09:03.620 --> 09:04.724
KALEB: Hey.

09:04.793 --> 09:06.068
BRITTANY: What are
you guys up to?

09:06.137 --> 09:08.344
KALEB: We are having a
little lesson on trapping.

09:08.931 --> 09:10.482
I'm thinking that's a
good place to start in

09:10.551 --> 09:13.379
the wilderness school
of hard knocks.

09:13.448 --> 09:14.413
BRITTANY: Yeah.

09:14.482 --> 09:15.655
KALEB: Our goal is gonna be

09:15.724 --> 09:17.655
to be out marten trapping,

09:17.724 --> 09:20.137
and you guys can learn
how to do all that.

09:20.206 --> 09:21.586
BRITTANY: All right,
Ellie and Gilbert.

09:21.655 --> 09:23.379
KALEB: So, let's go get the
snow machine loaded

09:23.448 --> 09:25.482
KALEB: and head out
into the woods.
BRITTANY: You go with Daddy.

09:25.551 --> 09:27.620
KALEB: Today I'm planning
on taking the kids out

09:27.689 --> 09:29.344
on a trapping trip.

09:29.586 --> 09:32.034
I'm gonna have my snow machine
outfitted with the tools that

09:32.103 --> 09:35.344
are needed to go on a
super light expedition.

09:35.413 --> 09:38.206
Using these traps as a kid
and getting out into

09:38.275 --> 09:40.758
the wilderness and cutting trail

09:40.827 --> 09:43.655
set me up as
the adult that I am today.

09:43.724 --> 09:45.103
We're ready to go.

09:45.172 --> 09:46.586
ELOVIE: One more thing.

09:46.655 --> 09:48.517
KALEB: Oh, Gilbert's
gonna bring his hatchet.

09:48.586 --> 09:50.103
GILBERT: Yeah, so I can use.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.724
BRITTANY: Sounds like a plan.

09:51.793 --> 09:53.413
KALEB: It's important for
the kids to learn how to go

09:53.482 --> 09:56.344
through the motions
of an expedition.

09:57.517 --> 09:58.655
BRITTANY: Let's go!

09:58.724 --> 10:01.172
KALEB: All right,
let's do this!

10:02.172 --> 10:06.137
Seeing what it takes to come
out of the woods with all of

10:06.206 --> 10:09.655
your limbs attached,
no frostbite, unharmed.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.862
They need to learn
how to survive.

10:13.931 --> 10:16.689
Ooh, this tree looks like
a good spot for marten set.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.689
BRITTANY: Here we go.

10:18.758 --> 10:23.137
KALEB: So, we're gonna use this
limb right here for our set,

10:23.206 --> 10:25.206
and the idea is that the
marten will come out on the

10:25.275 --> 10:27.586
the limb here
and reach out for the bait,

10:27.655 --> 10:29.310
which will be out past
the limb and our trap will be

10:29.379 --> 10:31.344
waiting for it right here.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.758
So, we need to make a loop
out of our chain, 'kay?

10:34.827 --> 10:37.275
And then we'll take our bait,
our nice little moose right here

10:37.344 --> 10:40.275
and we'll stick it straight out
like this so that it--

10:40.344 --> 10:42.655
so the marten can't just
come up right here

10:42.724 --> 10:44.344
and reach
out and paw at it.

10:44.413 --> 10:45.827
BRITTANY: Okay.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.310
KALEB: We want him to have to
come down this branch

10:47.379 --> 10:50.034
and get caught while he's
trying to reach out for this.

10:50.103 --> 10:52.758
BRITTANY: Last meal.
KALEB: Yep.

10:53.310 --> 10:56.103
BRITTANY: Kids at five
and seven are really sponges.

10:56.172 --> 10:59.379
They soak up everything
you're telling them.

10:59.931 --> 11:02.137
I think as much as we can get
down on our children's level

11:02.206 --> 11:05.241
and just really add
to that memory bank,

11:05.310 --> 11:09.103
the more they're able to pull
on it when they're older.

11:09.172 --> 11:12.068
I think that's so valuable
with where we live.

11:12.551 --> 11:13.586
KALEB: There we go.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.310
That's ready to catch a marten.

11:15.379 --> 11:17.241
And we're ready to
go down the trail.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.655
KALEB: I think it's important
to teach these survival skills,

11:19.724 --> 11:22.517
because as they get older,
they're gonna want to explore

11:22.586 --> 11:24.275
more and more.

11:24.344 --> 11:27.448
And I'm not always gonna
be there to help them out.

11:33.896 --> 11:36.379
[engine revving]

11:36.448 --> 11:39.413
[Kaleb groaning]

11:39.482 --> 11:42.275
KALEB: I think we're done.
BRITTANY: Oh, dear!

11:45.517 --> 11:49.551
[engine revving]

11:49.620 --> 11:51.034
KALEB: I think we're stuck.

11:51.103 --> 11:53.068
It's not going when
I pin and wiggle.

11:53.137 --> 11:54.758
BRITTANY: Well spotted.

11:54.827 --> 11:57.206
KALEB: Um, so I guess
this begins our scenario.

11:57.275 --> 11:58.586
BRITTANY: Yeah.

11:58.655 --> 12:00.724
KALEB: We need, we need
to make some shelter.

12:00.793 --> 12:02.551
In order to teach
Gilbert and Elovie

12:02.620 --> 12:05.413
that not everything goes
according to plan.

12:05.482 --> 12:09.413
I get my snow machine
stuck and I get it  stuck .

12:10.724 --> 12:15.896
My idea is they need to
learn how to survive in
freezing temperatures.

12:16.655 --> 12:19.896
This is a plausible situation
that happens to trappers

12:19.965 --> 12:22.034
all over Alaska all the time.

12:22.103 --> 12:23.413
ELOVIE: I am nothing.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.137
KALEB: We just need
this snow cave

12:25.206 --> 12:27.448
to be big enough
to fit a body in.

12:27.517 --> 12:31.172
The whole idea with a snow
shelter like this is to get

12:31.241 --> 12:33.965
a stranded trapper
out of the elements.

12:34.034 --> 12:36.827
Without a snow cave like
this, it would suck all

12:36.896 --> 12:38.793
the warmth out of
a person's body

12:38.862 --> 12:42.517
and literally freeze them
to death, in place.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.448
Now that we got
our trench built,

12:44.517 --> 12:46.103
we gotta line this floor
with spruce boughs.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.551
BRITTANY: Okay.

12:47.655 --> 12:50.724
KALEB: And this will insulate
the snow from our bodies,

12:50.793 --> 12:52.551
so we don't put a whole bunch
of heat through our coat

12:52.620 --> 12:54.172
and melt the snow underneath us,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.482
which would get us all wet.

12:56.551 --> 12:58.103
Then we'd get cold.

12:58.172 --> 13:00.034
BRITTANY: We like to teach
our children young,

13:00.103 --> 13:03.206
that way as they get older,
if they're ever in a situation

13:03.275 --> 13:06.931
like this, they have their
memories of what to do.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.517
KALEB: Now, I'm gonna work on
getting us a lot and a lot of

13:09.586 --> 13:12.551
branches to throw on top.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.103
No chainsaw.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.000
ELOVIE: I wanna...

13:20.827 --> 13:22.517
BRITTANY: Here's the last one.

13:22.586 --> 13:25.241
KALEB: There you go.
You cut a tree down.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.758
BRITTANY: Boom.

13:26.827 --> 13:30.275
KALEB: Now, I think we just
need to start covering this up

13:30.344 --> 13:32.413
with great big chunks of snow.

13:32.482 --> 13:36.000
And the idea is to stop any
wind that might come up

13:36.068 --> 13:39.758
at night from filtering
through and making us cold.

13:39.827 --> 13:42.103
I'm hoping that they
store this nugget of

13:42.172 --> 13:45.413
information away to be
used at a later date.

13:45.482 --> 13:46.655
BRITTANY: Good job, Gill.

13:46.724 --> 13:49.862
KALEB: When things might
not be going their way.

13:49.931 --> 13:51.758
BRITTANY: Ta-da!

13:51.827 --> 13:54.206
KALEB: I think that's
looking pretty good.

13:54.275 --> 13:56.172
BRITTANY: Oh, I think
the kids are in there.

13:56.241 --> 13:57.931
What do you guys
think of this?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.655
KALEB: Is it warmer in
there than out here?

13:59.724 --> 14:01.448
ELOVIE: Yeah.
KALEB: Yeah?

14:01.517 --> 14:05.724
Now we need to
establish a fire.

14:12.344 --> 14:14.793
CHRIS: There's only one way to
be successful in the Cosna,

14:14.862 --> 14:16.793
and that's to work hard.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.137
But it's not just
gonna be handed to me,

14:18.206 --> 14:19.965
I have to work for it.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.172
JESSI: What the [bleep]!

14:24.241 --> 14:25.448
Oh, my goodness!

14:25.517 --> 14:27.931
[laughing]

14:28.000 --> 14:30.655
CHRIS: Wow, look at
all the sign in here.

14:30.724 --> 14:31.965
JESSI: Whoa!

14:32.034 --> 14:33.689
CHRIS: This is awesome.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.379
Check this out, Jess.

14:37.448 --> 14:41.310
If you look up over here,
got the twin hills
that come together,

14:41.379 --> 14:43.896
I can see where
the crook comes down,

14:43.965 --> 14:44.931
and we're in the birch forest.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.206
JESSI: This is
the birch forest.

14:46.275 --> 14:47.965
CHRIS: So, we follow
the birch forest,

14:48.034 --> 14:50.137
we should find that
six-sided cabin.

14:50.206 --> 14:52.551
This looks like a great
area for moose hunting.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.137
Look at this lake.

14:57.172 --> 14:59.965
Look at this. Bear marks.

15:00.034 --> 15:02.344
Marking his territory,
and then a bigger bear,

15:02.413 --> 15:05.103
and then even a bigger
bear marked way up there.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.310
JESSI: There's no way, that's
like ten feet up the...

15:07.379 --> 15:08.896
CHRIS: Yeah, they're massive.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.862
We've seen grizzlies up here.

15:10.931 --> 15:13.758
Every time we find a good
area to trap, bears move in.

15:13.827 --> 15:16.413
And when you're looking up in
a tree and you see a bear that

15:16.482 --> 15:18.896
can reach 12 feet in the air,
that does not make Jessi,

15:18.965 --> 15:20.965
or I feel good.

15:21.034 --> 15:23.724
This guy is less than
two years old

15:23.793 --> 15:25.103
and he's probably
about my size.

15:25.172 --> 15:26.344
Right?

15:26.413 --> 15:28.206
But then if you look up
one more step,

15:28.275 --> 15:30.827
there's his parent.
That's a full-sized
grizzly bear.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.103
That is a big bear.

15:32.172 --> 15:33.827
Holy cow.

15:33.896 --> 15:35.793
That gives me a little worry.

15:35.862 --> 15:37.724
JESSI: I don't want anything
to do with that bear.

15:37.793 --> 15:41.310
CHRIS: No. Wow.

15:41.379 --> 15:42.931
JESSI: This is the best place
that we've found

15:43.000 --> 15:44.517
on the Cosna so far,
hunting wise.

15:44.586 --> 15:45.896
CHRIS: So why wouldn't
a bear be here?

15:45.965 --> 15:48.172
I mean that's just kind
of par for the course.

15:48.241 --> 15:50.448
We gotta move in and show
him that we're the predator.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.793
There's bigger, badder
predators out here than we are.

15:52.862 --> 15:55.344
That's just the name
of the game out here.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.034
There's no way this
bear's gonna stop us
from trapping this area.

15:58.103 --> 16:00.068
I'll fight for
it if I have to.

16:00.137 --> 16:01.482
Well, let's keep
looking for that cabin.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.344
I mean at this point...

16:03.413 --> 16:05.689
JESSI: Now, it's like a really
survival cabin if we decide

16:05.758 --> 16:06.965
that we're gonna hunt here.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.172
CHRIS: Yeah.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.517
I'm gonna be thinking
about him tonight.

16:09.586 --> 16:10.965
That's a big bear.

16:11.034 --> 16:12.689
JESSI: Yeah, I don't
wanna meet him.

16:12.758 --> 16:15.137
That's crazy,
let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here!

16:15.206 --> 16:16.413
CHRIS: I'm gonna go
get the machine, yeah.
I'm ready to leave.

16:16.482 --> 16:18.379
JESSI: I was so excited
just moments ago.

16:24.241 --> 16:27.103
ALEX: I didn't wanna go out
and contend with mother nature.

16:27.172 --> 16:31.275
I wanted to let mother nature
change me into what I feel

16:31.344 --> 16:33.275
like I was supposed to be.

16:39.310 --> 16:42.379
This is definitely
the heaviest thing
I've lifted in a while.

16:47.827 --> 16:50.068
Sturdy's not the word
I would use to describe this,

16:50.137 --> 16:54.000
but as long as it
doesn't fall apart,
it'll be safe, you know?

16:54.068 --> 16:56.620
I'll just have to be like
a monkey climbing trees.

16:56.689 --> 16:59.068
I've never gone up a
ladder like this before.

16:59.137 --> 17:02.275
I don't wanna over commit
myself to anything

17:02.344 --> 17:04.275
because the risk is deadly.

17:08.413 --> 17:12.275
This is my anchor, it's gonna
go between these two trees.

17:12.344 --> 17:15.379
You know, so I gotta get up
probably on this second to

17:15.448 --> 17:17.379
last rung here on the ladder.

17:17.448 --> 17:19.931
So, I wanna get it up out
of the reach of bears.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.655
So, the higher I can
get it, the better.

17:22.724 --> 17:25.620
The first thing I gotta do is
take another spruce pole up

17:25.689 --> 17:28.034
and I'm gonna hang
it between two trees.

17:28.103 --> 17:29.758
All right, here it goes.

17:29.827 --> 17:32.517
Kinda like I got a giant
football field goal post.

17:32.586 --> 17:36.206
And from that I can
hang a rope that will
haul up the platform.

17:43.827 --> 17:45.965
Is it scary?
A little bit.

17:46.034 --> 17:48.137
If I fall and get hurt,
I'm on my own.

17:48.206 --> 17:49.827
I don't wanna lay
on the ground,

17:49.896 --> 17:51.620
bleed internally
and freeze to death.

17:51.689 --> 17:54.103
So, I just wanna take
it slow and careful.

17:54.172 --> 17:58.482
These toe straps are basically
leftovers from job sites.

17:58.551 --> 18:00.344
Once they start getting
some frays in them,

18:00.413 --> 18:01.896
they say that's
not safe anymore,

18:01.965 --> 18:03.206
throw it away and
get a new one.

18:03.275 --> 18:05.275
And then I get 'em.

18:05.344 --> 18:08.379
Each step I take
could be my last.

18:08.448 --> 18:09.896
I'm just totally
trusting my life

18:09.965 --> 18:11.586
to these ratty
old toe straps.

18:14.034 --> 18:16.137
Oooh. Nope, nope,
nope, no, no.

18:16.206 --> 18:17.551
That feels-- no.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.551
ALEX: Oooh. Nope,
nope, nope, no, no.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.758
That feels, no.

18:26.758 --> 18:28.241
That thing felt
like it was going.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.000
I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm going down."

18:31.724 --> 18:34.172
Okay, that won't go anywhere.

18:34.241 --> 18:39.103
Now I can get my
second loop for the other
end of the log setup.

18:40.137 --> 18:42.758
I got one side of the spruce
pole that will be my anchor up.

18:42.827 --> 18:45.172
Now I got, have to
do the other one.

18:46.068 --> 18:49.413
This is not a drill,
this is the real deal.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.068
Let's do what we
came here to do.

18:53.965 --> 18:57.241
Now it might not look like
a traditional log cache,

18:57.310 --> 18:59.551
but I'm not concerned with
meeting modern professional

18:59.620 --> 19:01.379
building standards here.

19:01.448 --> 19:04.724
Okay, now just loop that in.

19:05.482 --> 19:07.241
I think it's good enough
for government work.

19:08.517 --> 19:11.000
I'm just concerned with
getting the job done.

19:16.413 --> 19:17.758
So now, I got the
cross beam up there,

19:17.827 --> 19:19.275
that's the dangerous work done.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.931
Now I gotta do, start doing
the kind of the figuring.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.068
I need to start getting
materials

19:23.137 --> 19:24.689
to build the platform from.

19:25.482 --> 19:26.862
Get to work.

19:28.068 --> 19:30.724
There's no telling when exactly
the bears are gonna wake up.

19:30.793 --> 19:32.931
Could be a month from now,
could be a week from now,

19:33.000 --> 19:34.896
maybe they're
waking up right now.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.206
Maybe that one right there,
that's probably the right size.

19:38.275 --> 19:40.310
I have to perceive problems
before they happen

19:40.379 --> 19:42.068
and try to do
something about them.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.137
If one comes out early,
he's gonna be really hungry

19:44.206 --> 19:46.000
and I don't wanna
find out then

19:46.068 --> 19:47.620
that I stashed my food too late.

19:52.551 --> 19:53.517
Okay.

19:53.586 --> 19:54.758
You know, I like the bears,

19:54.827 --> 19:56.517
but I don't wanna be
seeing them that much.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.655
And I don't want them to
think that I'm the food man.

19:58.724 --> 20:00.655
Because then one day
if I don't got food,

20:00.724 --> 20:03.310
they might start to
think I'm the food.

20:06.103 --> 20:09.000
This is, should be enough
materials to make my,

20:09.068 --> 20:10.586
my platform from.

20:10.655 --> 20:12.448
So, I'll just grab
my tote right here,

20:12.517 --> 20:14.758
measure it out and then
I'll cut it to length,

20:14.827 --> 20:16.379
and then all I gotta do is
just cut off a lot of ones

20:16.448 --> 20:18.000
to lay in the center.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.862
The main purpose of the
platform is to keep my food

20:19.931 --> 20:21.379
out of reach of bears.

20:21.448 --> 20:23.551
The platform will help
disassociate me

20:23.620 --> 20:27.103
and kind of my smell,
my presence, from food.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.310
I don't want the bears
to ever confuse the two.

20:29.379 --> 20:30.862
When I got Sipsy with me,

20:30.931 --> 20:32.724
I don't really worry too much

20:32.793 --> 20:35.689
about animals 'cause
he'll, you know,

20:35.758 --> 20:37.206
he's always aware
when they come around.

20:37.275 --> 20:38.965
He barks at 'em,
but I don't have

20:39.034 --> 20:41.034
that security system
with me right now.

20:41.103 --> 20:43.586
And I won't, you know,
this spring, so, um...

20:44.034 --> 20:46.275
Until I get Sipsy back
up here, you know,

20:46.344 --> 20:49.517
I gotta be alert all the time
just like he is.

20:49.586 --> 20:53.206
The food in these totes
is my wealth out here.

20:53.275 --> 20:56.068
It's essentially this platform
is my bank and it's where

20:56.137 --> 20:59.586
I have all of my wealth, all
of my money is in this bank.

20:59.655 --> 21:04.172
So, if a bear gets into this,
and he trashes my food supply,

21:04.241 --> 21:07.448
then I'm gonna be in a true
survival situation without

21:07.517 --> 21:09.310
a way to get help.

21:10.931 --> 21:13.793
Yeah, so these are
good and strong.

21:13.862 --> 21:17.655
So, I'll start figuring out
how this will get strung up.

21:17.724 --> 21:19.931
Just one problem at a time.

21:25.862 --> 21:28.344
JOHNNY: I don't think that
you can have failure

21:28.413 --> 21:30.137
and still be alive out here.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.655
It's survival, you have to
keep fighting, keep trying,

21:33.724 --> 21:37.206
that's what it means
to live this secluded
and this isolated.

21:41.482 --> 21:44.137
Back at the first hole, my
hopes are that I have fish on

21:44.206 --> 21:46.103
all these setlines.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.655
I got several hooks set.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.689
They've been working
all around the clock.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.103
I'm here to check it out,
see if I got a fish.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.241
Now fishing out here is a very
different type of fishing.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.965
I don't know where
the fish are,

21:58.034 --> 22:00.896
I don't know what depths,
what locations.

22:01.827 --> 22:03.206
It's feeling light.

22:04.103 --> 22:07.965
It's essentially an
aquarium that I can't see.

22:09.586 --> 22:11.103
And I still got bait.

22:11.172 --> 22:13.551
Definitely not a fish
on the end of this one.

22:14.137 --> 22:17.275
So, I'm gonna send it back
down and let it keep working.

22:17.344 --> 22:19.689
And that's the beauty
of setline fishing,

22:19.758 --> 22:22.137
I just let time do
the fishing for me.

22:24.620 --> 22:25.931
Well, that's the first hole.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.689
I got several more to check
so on to the next one.

22:33.448 --> 22:36.965
It's never easy to figure
everything out all at once.

22:37.034 --> 22:39.000
You gotta put the time in,
you gotta put the effort in,

22:39.068 --> 22:40.344
you gotta stay with it.

22:40.413 --> 22:43.068
'Cause I have faith,
I have hope.

22:43.137 --> 22:46.413
All right, so let's
see what we got here.

22:49.103 --> 22:51.758
Oh, I'm missing
bait on this one.

22:53.068 --> 22:55.241
Don't wanna be presumptuous
but I think it's safe to say

22:55.310 --> 22:58.586
that there's some fish
down in here so I'm gonna
put some more bait on it,

22:58.655 --> 23:01.620
send it down and let it
soak overnight again.

23:01.689 --> 23:03.517
On to the next hole.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.448
You know, these fish are
designed to outsmart me.

23:07.517 --> 23:09.758
My job is to outsmart them.

23:10.517 --> 23:12.103
Look at that.

23:12.172 --> 23:14.413
Bait gone again.

23:14.482 --> 23:16.793
It's a constant battle
of who's outsmarting who.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.482
And these fish want to prevail.

23:20.448 --> 23:21.827
Another bait gone.

23:23.413 --> 23:25.896
You know, the odds are
generally against you.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.655
This is the last one here.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.275
Bait is gone, once again.

23:34.344 --> 23:36.068
Man, that's a bummer.

23:36.586 --> 23:40.034
I've spent a lot of
time drilling through
four feet of ice.

23:40.103 --> 23:41.724
[sighs]

23:42.862 --> 23:45.344
At this point I think I gotta
come up with another plan.

23:45.413 --> 23:48.862
So, I think what I wanna
do is, I'm gonna jig.

23:48.931 --> 23:51.896
And I'm gonna just sit there
and work an artificial lure,

23:51.965 --> 23:55.965
and I think that's gonna
tell me a lot of what's
going on down there.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.965
And that's the plan.

23:58.034 --> 24:01.000
Everything is against me
in catching a fish today.

24:01.068 --> 24:05.896
I'm fighting way more
than getting bites or
not getting bites.

24:06.551 --> 24:09.448
I'm fighting the elements.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.655
Those winds are just
howling out here.

24:11.724 --> 24:14.206
You know I've been out
here in white outs.

24:14.275 --> 24:17.551
You get spun around, you don't
know where you're at

24:17.620 --> 24:20.103
and it's hard to tell which
direction you're trying
to walk in,

24:20.172 --> 24:21.724
what direction's home.

24:21.793 --> 24:25.172
And I can barely see where
the ice hole is at this point.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.517
Now my bag's just getting
buried in snow.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.172
My sled's getting covered,

24:41.068 --> 24:43.517
it's just smart to get out
before it whites out

24:43.586 --> 24:45.241
and you can't see.

24:49.206 --> 24:53.620
JOHNNY: There is no such thing
as failure to me out here,

24:54.034 --> 24:56.241
but there is death.

24:57.827 --> 24:59.275
That's what keeps
you alive out here,

24:59.344 --> 25:02.379
knowing when to call it quits.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.586
KALEB: Out here where people
are few and far between,

25:11.655 --> 25:14.724
it's very important to
rely on yourself

25:14.793 --> 25:16.965
to get what you need done.

25:17.689 --> 25:20.379
KALEB: Because you
don't always have
someone to bail you out.

25:21.517 --> 25:24.000
All right, the snow
cave looks great.

25:24.379 --> 25:25.724
We did an awesome job.

25:25.793 --> 25:27.034
BRITTANY: Yeah.

25:27.103 --> 25:29.206
KALEB: So, now we
need to light a fire,

25:29.275 --> 25:31.172
but we don't have
a lighter to use.

25:31.241 --> 25:35.241
So, what I'm thinking is we'll
wire some poles together to

25:35.310 --> 25:37.551
make a little raft
to light our fire on,

25:37.620 --> 25:39.724
and then we'll light the fire
next to the snow machine

25:39.793 --> 25:41.448
and then we'll
move it over to here.

25:41.517 --> 25:42.793
BRITTANY: Okay.

25:42.862 --> 25:44.827
KALEB: Let's get started.

25:44.896 --> 25:47.137
We'll have us a
fire in no time.

25:47.862 --> 25:49.793
Teaching the kids how to
survive in the wilderness is

25:49.862 --> 25:51.758
like teaching a
second language.

25:51.827 --> 25:53.896
It's all about repetition.

25:53.965 --> 25:56.034
We've got lots of,
lots of pitch here,

25:56.103 --> 26:00.517
which pitch burns really,
really hot and is a
great fire-starter.

26:00.586 --> 26:03.724
It's getting these
memories of a situation

26:03.793 --> 26:06.758
in their heads so that they
can someday think back

26:06.827 --> 26:09.344
"Now what did Dad do?"

26:11.172 --> 26:13.620
Gonna pull out a
whole bunch of wire.

26:13.689 --> 26:15.931
This is one thing,
when you're trapping,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.758
you always have wire with
you and it's such a valuable

26:18.827 --> 26:21.655
resource in a
situation like this,

26:21.724 --> 26:24.827
so we'll just take
it and do a twist.

26:25.931 --> 26:27.172
ELOVIE: Is that a trap?

26:27.241 --> 26:28.724
KALEB: And just keep
working your way down.

26:28.793 --> 26:30.931
Learning how to use the tools
and the resources around you

26:31.000 --> 26:34.517
is critical to living in
such a remote location.

26:34.896 --> 26:36.724
You just give it a nice tug.

26:36.793 --> 26:39.827
I think the best way to light
a fire without the use of

26:39.896 --> 26:44.137
a lighter is to take my tow rope
and drop it in my fuel tank

26:44.206 --> 26:46.413
and soak it in gas.

26:46.482 --> 26:50.241
Then I'll take wire
and arc it across my battery

26:50.310 --> 26:52.551
on the snow machine
and get a spark

26:52.620 --> 26:55.000
before that gas evaporates.

26:57.413 --> 26:58.689
And then I'm just gonna...

27:01.758 --> 27:03.586
Come on, gas, light.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.793
There we go!
[laughs]

27:09.793 --> 27:12.517
KALEB: I think being
able to have a problem

27:12.586 --> 27:14.586
and immediately move
onto the solution

27:14.655 --> 27:17.517
shows the kids that
there's a way around

27:17.586 --> 27:19.448
bad situations.

27:19.517 --> 27:21.551
There's always a way.

27:21.620 --> 27:25.517
We did it, succeeded in
lighting a fire without a match.

27:25.586 --> 27:28.655
Nice job, Team Rowland.

27:28.724 --> 27:32.551
You just have to come up
with an idea and try it.

27:32.620 --> 27:34.517
We learned how to
build a fire without a--

27:34.586 --> 27:38.034
without a mechanical lighter.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.724
BRITTANY: It was
amazing that it worked.

27:39.793 --> 27:42.172
KALEB: I really hope you
kids have learned something,

27:42.241 --> 27:45.482
a little nugget of wisdom that
you can take away from this.

27:45.551 --> 27:48.862
BRITTANY: Yeah, use what
you have when you have it.

27:48.931 --> 27:52.758
KALEB: Yep, I think it's
time to head back and, uh,

27:52.827 --> 27:55.862
call this training
scenario a wrap,

27:55.931 --> 27:58.931
and I think it's time to
move on down the trail.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Go check our sets.

28:09.482 --> 28:11.620
JESSI: I never thought that
it would take so much effort,

28:11.689 --> 28:15.068
so much work, but that's
the way that we make it.

28:15.137 --> 28:16.206
We love it out here.

28:16.275 --> 28:17.965
We want to live off the land.

28:28.862 --> 28:31.344
CHRIS: Might have to get
the chainsaw out here.

28:31.413 --> 28:33.034
CHRIS: I feel like
we're on the right track.

28:33.103 --> 28:34.482
Things are starting
to come into focus.

28:34.551 --> 28:37.068
We just need to keep
pushing farther.

28:37.137 --> 28:38.965
Maybe I can find that old
six-sided cabin that my dad

28:39.034 --> 28:40.655
was talking about.

28:40.724 --> 28:42.482
JESSI: What do you think?

28:43.103 --> 28:45.068
CHRIS: I might be able
to just push it down.

28:45.689 --> 28:47.620
JESSI: Kay.
CHRIS: You wanna
try help push?

28:47.689 --> 28:49.586
JESSI: Yeah. Ready?

28:49.655 --> 28:50.931
CHRIS: Yep.

28:54.172 --> 28:55.379
Here it goes!

28:55.448 --> 28:57.448
Come on!

28:57.517 --> 28:59.310
Watch out.

28:59.379 --> 29:00.827
Almost.

29:02.448 --> 29:04.206
Come on!

29:09.206 --> 29:10.413
JESSI: Whoo!

29:10.482 --> 29:14.551
CHRIS: There. Cool.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.482
JESSI: You wanna see if we can
get the chainsaw, cut this up?

29:17.551 --> 29:19.241
CHRIS: Yeah.

29:20.862 --> 29:22.034
See if I can get
this thing to start.

29:22.103 --> 29:23.931
It's covered in snow.

29:28.206 --> 29:29.896
JESSI: There we go.

29:33.310 --> 29:35.206
There's a cabin
somewhere out there,

29:35.275 --> 29:36.724
and we don't know
what's there.

29:36.793 --> 29:38.344
What if there's stuff
that's hidden in the ground?

29:38.413 --> 29:41.586
What if it's a
fantastic hunting spot?

29:41.931 --> 29:43.862
Just possibilities
upon possibilities,

29:43.931 --> 29:45.724
these stories that
we've been told.

29:45.793 --> 29:48.379
That's the adventurous
fantastic part of this.

29:48.448 --> 29:50.344
Who doesn't love a
good treasure hunt?

29:52.793 --> 29:54.068
Great.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.655
CHRIS: I'm gonna try and check
out my map and see if this is,

29:57.724 --> 30:00.310
uh, where we think we are.

30:03.206 --> 30:05.275
Let's see here.

30:05.344 --> 30:06.551
Oh, check this out.

30:06.620 --> 30:10.034
We are on the map exactly
where Dad told us to go.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.931
There's the hillsides
come down, right?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.793
We're gonna wanna
go that direction.

30:14.862 --> 30:16.000
JESSI: Like that?

30:16.068 --> 30:17.517
CHRIS: Right that direction.

30:17.586 --> 30:19.379
I mean pretty much towards
the crook of the hill from here

30:19.448 --> 30:20.896
should be that cabin.

30:20.965 --> 30:22.137
JESSI: This is wonderful.

30:22.206 --> 30:23.206
Let's go over there.
Let's check it out.

30:23.275 --> 30:24.689
CHRIS: Yeah.

30:25.896 --> 30:27.827
I'm feeling pumped right now.

30:28.344 --> 30:32.068
The opportunity to build
out an old cabin could
be a game-changer.

30:32.137 --> 30:33.965
Coming out and following
this treasure map,

30:34.034 --> 30:36.896
it's not gonna be
complete unless I find
that six-sided cabin.

30:39.931 --> 30:41.310
Check it out.

30:45.620 --> 30:46.931
JESSI: Oh, my goodness.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.448
CHRIS: Oh.

30:53.448 --> 30:56.172
♪ ♪

30:56.241 --> 30:58.275
[laughing]

30:59.068 --> 31:00.655
CHRIS: Not much left.

31:04.517 --> 31:07.655
Ha, the old man was right.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.206
Huh.

31:13.758 --> 31:14.758
JESSI: What?

31:14.827 --> 31:15.896
CHRIS: The logs
are really, uh,

31:15.965 --> 31:17.310
they're not in terrible shape.

31:17.379 --> 31:19.275
That's surprising.

31:21.068 --> 31:23.724
Oh-ho, this thing's awesome.

31:24.448 --> 31:26.551
JESSI: Nobody's been
out here for decades.

31:26.620 --> 31:29.586
This could be our
new hunting spot to sustain us

31:29.655 --> 31:31.586
for another year,
another two years.

31:31.655 --> 31:35.172
This is like a
thread to our future.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.793
I wanna come back
here in the summer.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.379
CHRIS: Me, too.

31:39.448 --> 31:40.758
JESSI: You know what I mean,
what does this place look like?

31:40.827 --> 31:42.896
What's underneath all of this?

31:42.965 --> 31:45.241
CHRIS: I'd love to find
an axe or the saw
that made this cabin.

31:45.310 --> 31:46.793
JESSI: That's exactly
what I was thinking,

31:46.862 --> 31:50.137
I wanna come and find,
like, dude probably left

31:50.206 --> 31:52.517
some of his tools here.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.241
CHRIS: Everybody was trying to
come up and get free land

31:54.310 --> 31:57.241
but living out here for three
years, it was tough.

31:57.310 --> 32:00.344
It's tough this day and age
with GPSs and satellite phones,

32:00.413 --> 32:02.517
imagine what it
was like before that.

32:02.586 --> 32:04.586
JESSI: In the 70s
before any of that.

32:04.655 --> 32:06.137
Incredible.

32:06.206 --> 32:08.517
CHRIS: I'm sure it broke a
lot of green people up here.

32:08.586 --> 32:10.482
Let's go check out
some stuff out here.

32:10.551 --> 32:13.034
JESSI: Yeah, let's
go towards the river.

32:13.103 --> 32:15.034
CHRIS: Look around
a little bit.

32:16.241 --> 32:17.379
JESSI: You see this
coming straight.

32:17.448 --> 32:18.620
CHRIS: Ah, these
are big prints.

32:18.689 --> 32:20.724
JESSI: Coming straight
from the cabin over here?

32:20.793 --> 32:22.551
CHRIS: That looks
like moose prints.

32:22.620 --> 32:24.655
Wow. Right at the cabin.

32:24.724 --> 32:26.275
This is awesome.

32:26.344 --> 32:28.482
JESSI: Right? I mean this,
nobody's been out here.

32:28.551 --> 32:29.793
CHRIS: This is really cool.

32:29.862 --> 32:31.896
Seeing the moose prints
here seals it for me.

32:31.965 --> 32:33.965
The fact that we've got
moose, we've got bears,

32:34.034 --> 32:35.724
we've got lynx,
we've got beavers.

32:35.793 --> 32:37.586
We have it right here.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.172
We've got three
lakes and a river.

32:39.241 --> 32:41.379
JESSI: It's got, like,
the best parts of

32:41.448 --> 32:44.275
every part of
the Cosna out here.

32:44.344 --> 32:46.551
CHRIS: Yeah, what a
treasure map Dad gave us.

32:51.586 --> 32:53.586
ALEX: Anyone can come out
here and just suffer.

32:53.655 --> 32:56.034
You gotta be able to find that
balance between enjoying

32:56.103 --> 32:58.310
the work that you're doing
and still meet the demands

32:58.379 --> 33:00.931
of mother nature all
at the same time.

33:07.896 --> 33:10.172
ALEX: Here's my platform.

33:10.241 --> 33:12.620
And I got my anchor waiting
up there to haul it up.

33:12.689 --> 33:17.551
What I'm gonna do is get it in
position, get my totes on it,

33:17.620 --> 33:21.310
and then last thing
I'll throw a rope
over the anchor up there,

33:21.379 --> 33:24.482
lower it down
and then give it a lift.

33:24.551 --> 33:27.758
I came out here to
Deadman Lake because I wanted to

33:27.827 --> 33:30.000
be able to get more
food from the land.

33:30.068 --> 33:32.000
I'm starting to
do some of that.

33:32.068 --> 33:35.344
I didn't come out here to live
against the other predators

33:35.413 --> 33:36.931
that live here.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.965
I came out here because
I wanna be like them.

33:39.034 --> 33:42.517
Me and the bears, the lynxes,
all the predators out here,

33:42.586 --> 33:44.689
we're all playing the
same game: get the food.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.206
That's the goal.

33:47.344 --> 33:50.275
I think what we'll do is
throw a line up over this,

33:51.275 --> 33:52.448
put a little tension on this

33:52.517 --> 33:54.034
and start to
raise it a little bit,

33:54.103 --> 33:57.206
and then I'll be able to adjust
all these to the right length.

33:57.275 --> 34:00.103
What this cache is gonna help
me do is help me make sure

34:00.172 --> 34:02.241
I'm playing the game of
get the food

34:02.310 --> 34:05.827
and I'm not playing
the game of fight
the other predators.

34:05.896 --> 34:08.034
If I give other predators
the opportunity to rob me,

34:08.103 --> 34:10.206
then it's gonna be war.

34:10.275 --> 34:12.551
It's like they say: the only
thing necessary for evil

34:12.620 --> 34:14.724
to prevail is for
good men to do nothing.

34:14.793 --> 34:16.724
I have to be the good
men who does something.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.413
Otherwise, it's gonna be war.

34:24.793 --> 34:28.241
Yeah, that's pretty good.

34:28.310 --> 34:31.103
Let's see. Let's measure
how high that is.

34:31.172 --> 34:32.344
Let's see if I
accomplished my goal.

34:32.413 --> 34:34.103
I'm six foot.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.896
This stick is maybe about
a foot shorter than me

34:37.965 --> 34:40.000
so that's probably...

34:41.172 --> 34:45.310
me plus five foot
would be, um, uh, 11.

34:45.379 --> 34:47.206
Uh, so it's not quite 12 feet.

34:47.275 --> 34:49.965
So, the biggest, tallest
grizzly could feasibly reach it.

34:52.551 --> 34:55.827
Yeah, that's actually
a real problem.

34:55.896 --> 34:58.344
Uh, you know, a black bear
could easily climb this tree

34:58.413 --> 34:59.724
and then if he can
get up there, he'll--

34:59.793 --> 35:01.862
if he's messing with it,
he'll dump it over.

35:01.931 --> 35:04.862
You know bears are persistent
so he's probably gonna just

35:04.931 --> 35:07.068
smell the smell up there,
start climbing to get it,

35:07.137 --> 35:09.689
reach over, you know
dump everything.

35:09.758 --> 35:13.103
Sheet metal is an important
tool out here at Deadman Lake.

35:13.172 --> 35:15.137
So, the last thing
I'll wanna do is, uh,

35:15.206 --> 35:18.965
make these trees to where
a bear can't climb 'em.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.758
So, I'll just wrap 'em
with sheet metal

35:20.827 --> 35:22.379
and then that'll be slick.

35:22.448 --> 35:23.827
A bear won't be
able to get up it.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.896
And that'll be the final,
that'll be the final touch.

35:25.965 --> 35:28.517
Then I'll have a 99%
bear-proof cache here.

35:34.793 --> 35:36.965
JOHNNY: Some people like to say
there's no guarantees out here.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.034
But I think there
are guarantees.

35:39.103 --> 35:41.344
You could easily starve if
you don't put in the effort

35:41.413 --> 35:44.724
to find food,
so that's a solid guarantee.

35:50.172 --> 35:51.689
All right, it's a new day.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.172
The weather's changed.

35:53.241 --> 35:54.413
It's beautiful today.

35:55.379 --> 35:57.448
I haven't had a bunch of luck
with the setlines on the other

35:57.517 --> 35:59.758
one's that I'd had set.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.965
Uh, got skunked
on all of them.

36:02.034 --> 36:05.689
But I'm hoping that, uh, some
of these will yield some fish.

36:05.758 --> 36:09.344
It'd be a huge bummer to know
that I've pounded all these

36:09.413 --> 36:12.413
holes through the ice, that
I've sat out here through

36:12.482 --> 36:15.896
the beginning of an arctic
storm, and there's no fish.

36:22.137 --> 36:24.241
It feels a little
bit light weight.

36:26.206 --> 36:27.655
Nothing.

36:28.137 --> 36:30.862
I got more set though
and I'm gonna keep
the spirits high

36:30.931 --> 36:32.310
and, um, go check those out.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.862
Onto the next one.

36:34.931 --> 36:37.448
There's no second option.

36:37.517 --> 36:41.068
The only option is to keep
being persistent

36:41.137 --> 36:44.551
and keep finding a way to get
solid food sources.

36:52.896 --> 36:54.206
Nothing.

36:54.827 --> 36:56.655
I'm gonna drop it back down.

36:56.724 --> 36:58.724
Cross my fingers,
hope for the best.

36:58.793 --> 37:02.137
Maybe the fish gods will come

37:02.206 --> 37:04.620
and put some fish on
the end of these hooks.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.482
Onto the next one.

37:07.931 --> 37:11.448
I'm walking into the freezer
section of my grocery store

37:11.517 --> 37:13.310
and it's like I'm blindfolded

37:13.379 --> 37:15.310
and I don't know if
anything's on the shelves.

37:15.379 --> 37:17.862
That's essentially what
ice fishing is out here.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.620
All right, this is
the last setline.

37:21.448 --> 37:25.103
It's just like, like every,
every attempt I've had on this

37:25.172 --> 37:29.413
lake has come up
empty and, uh,

37:29.482 --> 37:30.620
I don't know if it's the cold.

37:30.689 --> 37:33.034
I don't know if it's
the time of year.

37:33.103 --> 37:36.379
I've tried so many different
methods: jigging, setlines.

37:36.448 --> 37:38.103
I'm starting to think this
whole ice fishing thing

37:38.172 --> 37:39.586
is a huge hoax out here.

37:45.448 --> 37:46.896
All right.

37:48.103 --> 37:49.517
Oh, does that feel...

37:50.724 --> 37:52.413
I feel a little tension
on this one.

37:53.068 --> 37:55.034
Could just be the weight.

37:56.344 --> 37:57.379
Oh.

38:04.620 --> 38:07.620
No way! Oh, [bleep]

38:12.275 --> 38:15.275
♪ ♪

38:16.793 --> 38:19.172
JOHNNY: Look at that.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

38:23.482 --> 38:26.379
Lake trout.
That is awesome.

38:26.448 --> 38:29.034
There is fish in this lake.

38:29.103 --> 38:31.172
For my first
arctic lake trout,

38:31.241 --> 38:32.827
this is gonna be a good meal.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.206
This is awesome.

38:34.379 --> 38:37.241
Sweet, sweet feeling of success
to see that lake trout.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.137
I've tried so hard out here.

38:39.206 --> 38:42.482
I've put in days of
backbreaking labor.

38:42.551 --> 38:46.172
I now know where I can
get food from this lake.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.137
I'm gonna get this
sucker off the line,

38:48.206 --> 38:50.862
probably go find a
place amongst the trees.

38:50.931 --> 38:52.896
Hunker down
inside the wood line

38:52.965 --> 38:56.310
and cook it up over
a fire right outside.

38:56.379 --> 38:58.000
There's no other way I should
be eating this fish except for

38:58.068 --> 38:59.689
out here in nature.

38:59.758 --> 39:03.379
It wasn't an easy task, but
the next time I go out fishing,

39:03.448 --> 39:05.758
I know where to go,
and I know that next time

39:05.827 --> 39:08.586
that I come back out here,
I'm coming home with food.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.068
I feel like I finally sealed
the deal with this lake.

39:15.862 --> 39:17.586
CHRIS: Ah, no way.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.310
Wow, that thing is in there.

39:21.827 --> 39:25.689
JESSI: No way. Ah!

39:25.758 --> 39:28.517
I can't believe it,
I can't get it out!

39:28.586 --> 39:30.827
CHRIS: Yeah, it's been
in there for 40 years.

39:30.896 --> 39:35.241
Wow. That's in there.

39:42.931 --> 39:44.620
[laughing]

39:44.689 --> 39:46.310
JESSI: I did it.

39:49.482 --> 39:51.931
CHRIS: Wow, look at that.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.655
We got our treasure.

39:54.724 --> 39:56.689
CHRIS: It's always how it is
out here: the harder you work,

39:56.758 --> 40:00.137
the more you suffer, the
more the Cosna rewards you.

40:01.103 --> 40:02.517
JESSI: What a find.

40:02.586 --> 40:03.724
CHRIS: I know.

40:03.793 --> 40:05.103
I'm looking forward
to the future.

40:05.172 --> 40:06.689
I'm hoping that our family
homestead just lives on

40:06.758 --> 40:09.241
generation after generation.

40:18.275 --> 40:19.586
BRITTANY: Oh, man.

40:19.655 --> 40:21.000
KALEB: Oh, man.
The trap is snapped.

40:21.068 --> 40:22.310
BRITTANY:
And the food's still there.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.034
KALEB: Yeah, do you
wanna eat my bait?

40:24.103 --> 40:25.482
GILBERT: I would!

40:25.551 --> 40:27.206
BRITTANY: Just dust
off the copper a bit.

40:27.275 --> 40:28.793
KALEB: There you go.

40:29.586 --> 40:32.034
If the marten can
eat it, I can eat it.

40:32.103 --> 40:34.103
BRITTANY: Yeah, right.

40:34.172 --> 40:36.724
KALEB: At the end
of this survival scenario,

40:36.793 --> 40:39.758
I feel a lot more confident
about the kids going out

40:39.827 --> 40:42.172
into the woods
in real life now.

40:42.241 --> 40:44.413
All right, you wanna
throw this in the box?

40:44.482 --> 40:45.931
BRITTANY: Yeah.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.620
KALEB: This ends our survival
simulation trapline tragedy.

40:49.689 --> 40:53.896
And I think you guys all
did a fantastic job today.

40:53.965 --> 40:55.551
BRITTANY: So, we all get A++?

40:55.620 --> 40:58.482
KALEB: A++.
BRITTANY: Yay.

41:06.724 --> 41:08.275
ALEX: Okay, the
platform's working good.

41:08.344 --> 41:11.137
Um, the only problem is
it's not 100% bear-proof yet

41:11.206 --> 41:14.482
because bears can climb
up these trees and, uh,

41:14.551 --> 41:17.413
and then they'll be able to
reach the platform

41:17.482 --> 41:19.000
and, uh, get to my food.

41:19.068 --> 41:23.724
So, if I can use some
sheet metal here,

41:23.793 --> 41:25.103
wrap the sheet
metal around it,

41:25.172 --> 41:26.965
and then its claws
can't sink into it

41:27.034 --> 41:28.620
and he can't climb any longer.

41:30.241 --> 41:32.034
ALEX: I came out here first
it's just about

41:32.103 --> 41:34.275
keeping myself
warm in the winter.

41:34.344 --> 41:35.896
Then it was about
getting water,

41:35.965 --> 41:37.413
getting food,
now it's about,

41:37.482 --> 41:38.965
"Okay, how do I
store that food?

41:39.034 --> 41:40.965
How do I keep it
safe from predators?"

41:42.000 --> 41:43.034
I don't want the bear to be
able to beat me

41:43.103 --> 41:45.172
just through
persistence, you know?

41:45.241 --> 41:47.448
I have to, I have to make
it really hard for the bear.

41:47.517 --> 41:48.724
Now when I go and get food,

41:48.793 --> 41:50.758
I've got a place
to store it safely.

41:50.827 --> 41:53.448
You know I--I feel pretty
comfortable leaving my,

41:53.517 --> 41:55.034
my food here.

41:55.103 --> 41:57.103
It makes me feel a lot
safer inside my tent.

41:57.172 --> 41:58.931
I don't gotta worry
about a bear

41:59.000 --> 42:00.344
coming and sniffing
around there.

42:00.413 --> 42:02.931
This is one more important
milestone that's gonna help

42:03.000 --> 42:06.310
get me firmly established
here at Deadman Lake.

42:06.379 --> 42:08.275
It's another rung
on the ladder.

42:16.103 --> 42:17.793
JOHNNY: I'm starting
a little fire here.

42:17.862 --> 42:20.896
While that's warming up, I'm
gonna lay the lake trout here

42:20.965 --> 42:23.724
and just cook it right
on the side of this lake.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.344
JOHNNY: I knew it was
gonna be a lot of work

42:27.413 --> 42:30.172
trying to figure out
these fish in this lake.

42:30.241 --> 42:31.620
You know, I went
into it knowing that.

42:31.689 --> 42:34.862
So, coming out of it
with a fish finally,

42:34.931 --> 42:36.586
it's a big deal for me.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.172
The birds will like this.

42:38.241 --> 42:41.206
Not only did I learn
about a new food source,

42:41.275 --> 42:43.827
but I learned new methods
that I've never tried before.

42:43.896 --> 42:46.137
I've never done setlines

42:46.206 --> 42:48.689
on a frozen lake in
the middle of the arctic.

42:52.448 --> 42:54.068
Here we go.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.862
It's been a long few days.

42:56.931 --> 42:59.241
This is what it's
all about right here.

42:59.310 --> 43:02.965
You know I could look at this
like another notch in my belt.

43:03.034 --> 43:05.965
Something I can continue to
go back and have a renewable

43:06.034 --> 43:08.965
sustainable resource of food.

43:09.034 --> 43:11.000
'Cause that's what life
is out here for me.

43:11.068 --> 43:12.310
I don't have
any other options.

43:12.379 --> 43:13.758
This is it. This is my food.

43:13.827 --> 43:16.620
It's time to peel
into this guy.

43:21.413 --> 43:23.310
The bones just come right out.

43:25.172 --> 43:28.310
Oh, man, that's so good.

43:28.379 --> 43:31.758
All that effort,
all that trial and error.

43:31.827 --> 43:37.344
The ebbs and flows,
it was well worth it.

43:43.655 --> 43:45.482
JOHNNY: To me,
these are the pillars

43:45.551 --> 43:47.586
that all Alaskans share:

43:47.655 --> 43:51.862
perseverance, persistence,

43:51.931 --> 43:53.655
the energy to come out here,

43:53.724 --> 43:56.517
do all this
back-breaking labor,

43:57.482 --> 43:59.206
day-in and day-out.

44:00.206 --> 44:02.620
Even if you aren't
successful, turn around,

44:02.689 --> 44:05.034
you come right back out,
do it again.

44:05.103 --> 44:08.724
This is Alaska baby,
this is what it's all about.
