NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:03.254 --> 00:05.165
My dad lied to me
about my entire life,

00:05.256 --> 00:07.463
my biological parents,
my ability.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.086
You can't just hide
things like that.

00:09.552 --> 00:11.793
ZACH: A 21-year-old woman
was killed in the explosion.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.422
Also killed in the fire
was her 18â€”month-old
daughter.

00:15.558 --> 00:18.174
Hi, I'm looking for someone
related to Meredith Gordon.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.349
This is her.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.722
Mom?

00:20.813 --> 00:24.431
Where are you taking us?
Tell your boss lam on
very important mission.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.599
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

00:33.117 --> 00:35.859
It could take years
to integrate
a multiple personality,

00:35.953 --> 00:38.911
but if you let me,
I can help you.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.619
What I am, you can't fix.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.496
Who are you?
How can you see me?

00:44.587 --> 00:46.202
I don't know.
I just do what
you can do.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.788
I'm the Invisible Man.
I'm Claude Rains.
Now get away from me.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.467
I found you.
I need you to help me.
This entire city is in danger.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.044
You seemed pretty sure
about that pending
apocalypse of yours.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.596
How many people
have you taught before me?

00:59.310 --> 01:04.850
If he crashes,
you bring him back,
again and again.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.017
He's dead.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.815
WOMAN: Owl

01:15.034 --> 01:16.069
Hey!

01:16.160 --> 01:18.401
I don't see how petty theft
is part of my training.

01:18.496 --> 01:23.331
There's a lot you don't see.
You have no idea how to use
these gifts of yours properly.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.668
Yeah, and you do? No.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.996
Right now, your abilities
only show up as a reflex.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.830
Autonomic,
like swallowing.
That's a dog's trick.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.835
Making it a
conscious choice,
using it,

01:31.926 --> 01:33.257
that's what makes you
more than a poodle.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.835
Now, is insulting me
really going to help me
learn how to do that?

01:35.930 --> 01:38.717
Listen, you're the one
who's a bomb set to blow up
me and everyone in this city,

01:38.808 --> 01:40.218
unless I can get you
housebroken.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.011
CLAUDE: That's right,
now he's listening.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.178
Now, you absorb

01:46.274 --> 01:48.060
all these abilities
you find, yeah?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.607
You're invisible with me,
you've flown,
you've read some minds.

01:50.695 --> 01:51.935
Yeah, it put me in a coma
for two weeks.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.610
Your body doesn't know
what to do with them all.

01:53.698 --> 01:56.280
lt's gotten jumbled,
like file cards knocking
around a shoebox,

01:56.367 --> 01:58.608
except with you,
the cards are
doused in plutonium,

01:58.703 --> 02:00.364
piling up
to a critical mass.

02:01.747 --> 02:05.456
Now, I'm gonna teach you
how to pull them out
one at a time.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.124
PETER:
You think that's possible?

02:07.211 --> 02:08.826
I hope so.
Next time you shut down

02:08.921 --> 02:11.833
might not be just a coma.
It might be the day
you meltdown.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.131
So, then let's get to
today's lesson.
All right.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.709
Let's start by seeing
if you can hold on
to one of your powers

02:16.804 --> 02:18.510
without your benefactors
hanging around.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.098
You think
I could do that alone?

02:20.725 --> 02:24.217
We're about to find out.
Remember to breathe.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.184
Hey!

02:41.704 --> 02:44.491
God, it sounds like
a bomb is about
to go off.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.415
I know it's hard.
Just focus on the mirror
and try to relax.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.618
I can't relax.
You're trying to
bring her out.

02:50.755 --> 02:51.744
Jessica.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.463
I told you,
she is dangerous.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.207
She could hurt you.
Show me.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.754
Those cuffs could keep
an elephant in that chair.

03:02.767 --> 03:06.351
And just 'cause I'm a shrink,
don't think I don't know
how to use that taser.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.849
I thought that the goal
was to get rid of her.

03:08.939 --> 03:13.182
The goal here
is to bring your two halves
to a healthy middle,

03:13.277 --> 03:18.067
to have a unified
and whole you,
not two aspects at war.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.325
How do we do this?

03:23.412 --> 03:25.789
Like I said,
you focus on the reflection,

03:26.791 --> 03:28.201
and breathe.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.825
Come on.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.959
Feel free
to let your mind wander.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.380
We used to have a
piano in our home.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.131
You played?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.058
Chopsticks, barely.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.343
My sister.
Jessica.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.143
She played beautifully.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.811
| used to play
with her sheet music.

03:59.115 --> 04:03.779
I didn't know what it was,
just dots and lines.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.582
I would get out my crayons
and connect the dots.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.670
Jessica used to say

04:19.885 --> 04:22.672
I could turn
Mozart into a monkey.

04:25.391 --> 04:26.471
JESSICA:
I sure did.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.885
Jessica.

04:28.561 --> 04:29.846
You should've listened
to little mouse.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.878
How's Claire?

05:12.855 --> 05:14.265
That was for the haircut.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.005
You shouldn't have built
such a good cage.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.431
If you go anywhere
near her...

05:53.521 --> 05:54.931
No! No!

05:59.485 --> 06:00.941
No!

You didn'tjust
use your key this time.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.386
I shouldn't have them,
not anymore.

06:33.978 --> 06:36.640
You started painting since you
got back from rehab.
Can I see them?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.185
That's not done yet.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.153
Oh, God.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.734
That's the roof
of my father's building.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.369
We had a lot of good
memories up there.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.242
Is that how you
painted our relationship,

06:56.333 --> 06:57.584
like a city destroyed?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.249
What are you
looking for,
Simone?

07:03.007 --> 07:04.668
lt's Peter.
He's still missing.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.715
I'm running out
of places to look.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.627
You finally believe
I can paint the future,

07:10.014 --> 07:11.925
and you want to use it
to find your new boyfriend.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.885
I don't want to be
asking you this, either.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.725
Can you?

07:16.979 --> 07:18.640
l have been.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.184
Except it's
not working.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.187
Every time I try to paint
where Peter is,
| get nothing.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.768
You've been trying
to find him? Why?

07:26.322 --> 07:27.778
I know what he can do.

07:27.865 --> 07:31.278
He's the one that's gonna
turn New York into this.
I'm not gonna let him.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.574
How do you know
so much about him?

07:32.703 --> 07:34.614
Because I painted it.

07:37.291 --> 07:41.455
I care about you, Simone,
more than I knew
how to say when...

07:41.545 --> 07:44.412
When it would have
made a difference.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.122
But right now,
I don't care if you hate me,
ljust want you safe.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.502
Stay away from Peter.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.846
Just tell me
you'll look for him.

07:57.728 --> 07:58.717
I'll try.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.678
Yeah.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.140
Simone.

08:07.946 --> 08:08.935
Keep the key.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.290

08:26.423 --> 08:28.584
The manatee's on
the brink of extinction.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.759
There's one at the
aquarium in Lubbock
and the marine biologist said

08:31.845 --> 08:33.585
we could stop by anytime.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.844
You're asking
my permission
to skip school?

08:37.101 --> 08:39.843
No, if I wanted
to skip school,
I'd check into homeroom,

08:39.937 --> 08:41.268
and then sneak out
Miss Robert's window,

08:41.355 --> 08:42.970
but you've always
stressed honesty,

08:43.065 --> 08:44.271
so I'm being
honest

08:45.943 --> 08:47.649
The manatee is a
very noble creature.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.357
Is your car
in working order,
Zachary?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.359
| just had the oil changed.
Any tickets?

08:53.617 --> 08:55.027
Just parking.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.531
You'll be home
for dinner.
Yes.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.203
That's not a question.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.782
I'm making fajitas.
Zach, you're welcome
to join us.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.332

Okay.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.878
We'll wait 15 minutes,
and then head out.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.213
Do you have
the directions to Kermit?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.717
Uh, yeah.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.676
Look, what if
your mom wants proof
about the aquarium?

09:25.733 --> 09:26.893
Where did you get these?

09:27.109 --> 09:29.316
Motel 6 lobby
and my color printer.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.773
No one can know
we're going to see
my real mom.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.451

Oh! Wait.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.815
What happened?
No!

12:34.004 --> 12:35.619
I tried to tell her.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.248
Take me back to my cell!
Love to.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.883
Thanks for almost
getting me arrested.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.931
A little more focus,
you'd have had some cash
and fresh lipstick.

12:48.018 --> 12:51.226
I never said it'd be easy.
In fact, I think I said
repeatedly it'd be crap.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.929
You've been doing
this for 15 years.
Cut me a little slack

12:54.024 --> 12:55.309
on trying to do it
for five minutes.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.482
You'll learn.
We've just got to find
what's holding you back.

12:57.569 --> 13:01.403
Cops have my name and address.
I'm pretty sure Nathan's gonna
kill me first, anyway.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.731
You worry a lot
about your people,
don't you?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.111
Your friends, your mother,
your brother.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.161
No wonder your
head's all clogged.
You're still sunk under.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.783
Under what?
Your attachments.

All these people
who feed you biscuits,
patyourhead,

13:13.377 --> 13:15.083
and tell you
you're not fit
for the outdoors.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.828
You still see yourself
through their eyes.
Is that it?

13:17.923 --> 13:18.958
No. I don't.

13:19.049 --> 13:22.041
Right. Well, I'll bet you
$20 your dad didn't
make much of you, either.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.465

We've got to get these
people out of your head.

13:26.556 --> 13:30.140
Do you understand?
These people are my family.
| can'tjust cut them out.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.310
Peter can't use his powers
without someone
holding his hand.

13:33.397 --> 13:36.389
How can you not
punch that face
every time you see it?

13:36.525 --> 13:38.481
He's not like that.
He is. Trust me.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.728
You don't know him.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.983
I don't need to.
I've spent a lot of time
moving around people's homes,

13:43.073 --> 13:44.062
their bedrooms.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.489
You get to know people
if you see them when
they think they're alone.

13:46.576 --> 13:50.410
You see them
for what they truly are.
Selfish, deceitful and gassy.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.783
So, what is that,
your big truth
about the world?

the rest of them.

what your girl's up to.

we can clear your head.

Maybe she likes the open road.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.490
Just not what I imagined.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.743
Stop imagining.
She's right there.

17:59.871 --> 18:00.986
What am I supposed to say?

18:01.081 --> 18:04.164
"Hi, I'm your daughter,
and I can re-grow my kidney"?

18:05.335 --> 18:07.917
I mean, what if she's got
burns and scars from the fire.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.119
She's supposed
to be dead, right?

18:09.214 --> 18:10.203
So are you, remember?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.376
I heard you got
that in common.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.675
Hey, where are you going?

exit strategy.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.081
Yeah.

19:06.896 --> 19:07.885
(GROWLING)

19:11.985 --> 19:16.354
Hi, little fluffy.
Claire home from school yet?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.355
No?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.530
We'll just wait.

19:24.873 --> 19:25.908
Now, what's your name?

19:26.041 --> 19:27.030
(DOOR OPENING)

19:27.250 --> 19:30.583
SANDRA: Mr. Muggles,
where are you, baby?
Mama's home!

19:32.547 --> 19:33.707
Of course.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.923
Let's go say hi.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.940
Oh! I'm sorry.
Who are you?

19:57.572 --> 19:59.563
| just came from
the paper factory, ma'am.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.193
I'm just making
a delivery for your husband,

20:01.284 --> 20:06.199
and I saw this little guy
in the street.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.278
(LAUGHS)

20:07.415 --> 20:09.406
Now, somebody must have left
the backdoor open.

20:10.418 --> 20:14.081
Oh, I hope you don't mind,
I took the liberty.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.168
Well, aren't you sweet?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.600
And he was just
out there in the yard?
Oh.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.228
Just chewing
on a sprinkler head.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.304
Hmm.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.392
Who left those doors open,
Mr. Muggles?

20:36.486 --> 20:39.148
Claire or Lyle?
You tell me,
so I can tan their ass.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.315
Well, thanks for
inviting me in.

20:43.660 --> 20:47.369
I always wanted to see
where Mr. Bennet lived.

20:48.623 --> 20:53.083
It is so funny how
all y'all call him
Mr. Bennet over there.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.831
I've always just
known him as...
Stop that, you.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.381
SANDRA:
No more shoes.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.923
He just discovered shoelaces.
Can't get enough.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.754
That's funny,
I never really imagined
him as much of a dog person.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.012
I guess he just looms
a little larger when
he's drilling you.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.594
He mostly talks about Claire.
l was hoping to meet her,
actually.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.395
I've heard so much
about her.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.939
Well, she has promised
to be home for dinner,

21:17.026 --> 21:18.641
which means
a half an hour late.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.443
My son is at
a tae kwon do
sleepover tonight.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.237
That means an extra plate.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.778
Why don't you stay for dinner?

21:28.121 --> 21:31.454
Least I can offer
my new hero.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.992
Are you sure?
It's not too much trouble?

21:35.086 --> 21:38.499
I will call my husband
and tell him to expect you.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.376
What did you say your
name was again, Mr...

21:40.467 --> 21:41.502
Sylar.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.216
Oh, I don't think
you'll reach him
at the office, though.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.593
Last I saw
he was just swamped.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.396
l'm staring.
I'm sorry.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.227
(SIGHS)

22:03.406 --> 22:04.566
I mean,
you have to understand.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.522
lneverthought
this would happen.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.734
You're sitting
inches away from me.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.361
You're so beautiful.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.237
Thank you.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.917
Are you a good student?

22:16.085 --> 22:19.077
I'm okay.
Lousy at math.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.082
No help from me there.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.173
Well, I'll bet
you're all kinds of popular.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.797
l was homecoming queen,
kind of.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.219
Damn, I missed so much.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.803
If I'd known you
were out there, but...

22:33.269 --> 22:35.009
You must think
something awful.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.265
l was so sure that
nothing could have
survived that fire.

22:41.152 --> 22:45.486
It was a miracle
that I did, and...
God, when I saw that roof...

22:51.204 --> 22:53.160
Don't question
the miracle, right?

22:53.456 --> 22:54.445
Here,

22:54.916 --> 22:56.156
it's horchata.

22:58.211 --> 23:01.294
I learned a secret recipe
in Mexico. lt's sweet.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.382
You lived in Mexico?

23:06.469 --> 23:07.458
Mmm-hmm.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.919
Oh, I moved around a lot.

23:11.307 --> 23:15.641
After I lost you,
| sort of started running.
I never really stopped.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.479
| only came back to Kermit
a couple of months ago.

23:19.774 --> 23:24.268
I spent some time
in Cuernavaca,
in La Paz.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.898
You've never been.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.195
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

23:28.616 --> 23:29.605
Sorry.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.652
It's my mom.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.407
Hi. Yeah,
we're at the
aquarium right now.

23:38.626 --> 23:42.084
They just let Zach
feed him turtle grass.
We're practically on our way.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.331
We'll be home
in, like, an hour.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.003
No, I won't let him speed.
Okay, bye.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.504
She doesn't
know you're here.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.392
She doesn't really
understand what's going on
with me right now.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.311
Neither of my parents do.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.935
l'll pretend I understand
why you're sneaking around.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.025
All girls deserve
their secrets, right?

24:07.488 --> 24:09.228
Seems like I have
a lot of them these days.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.530
l have to show you something.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.117
You may understand it,
you may not, but...

24:20.627 --> 24:23.209
I need you to see.
See what?

24:26.299 --> 24:28.381
I think I know
how I survived that fire.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.719
Claire, don't!
It's okay.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.065
Please, say something.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.447
Some family.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.662
I told Claire
to get a move on.
She said she'd be back soon.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.000
A cheerleader, huh?

25:09.425 --> 25:11.541
Co-captain by junior year.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.000
Wow!

25:13.137 --> 25:15.298
Although
not so much these days.
They dissolved the team

25:15.390 --> 25:18.928
because of some
horrible event at the school.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.225
Oh, I heard about that.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.975
That must have been
hard on poor Claire.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.112
You are awfully interested
in my daughter.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.902
Well, ever since
I've seen what she can do,

25:31.989 --> 25:34.776
I guess you could
say I'm a fan.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.823
She's really quite gifted.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.745
Oh, you've been to a game?

25:43.084 --> 25:44.699
Yeah, I guess I have.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.918
| just couldn't get
over those irresistible

25:49.966 --> 25:51.206
talents of hers.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.334
I Should...

25:56.097 --> 25:59.009
I should check
with my husband again.
Excuse me.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.933
I'd rather you didn't,
so I can surprise him.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.015
How...
How did you do that?

26:09.110 --> 26:11.852
l'm special,
just like Claire.

26:11.946 --> 26:15.985
Well, different,
but you catch the meaning.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.577
It's a shame
I'll have to kill her.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.281
But maybe
I'll kill you first.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.705
I really haven't
decided yet.

26:37.555 --> 26:38.544
(GROANING)

26:42.310 --> 26:44.016
(GASPING)

26:51.944 --> 26:52.933
Hi.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.572
Find him.
He dies!

27:12.173 --> 27:14.129
I don't understand
what happened.
Why was he...

27:14.217 --> 27:16.583
He moved the phone

27:16.886 --> 27:18.842
without even
touching it.
Shh.

27:19.555 --> 27:24.174
You're safe now.
I'm right here.
I'll find him.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.096
He kept asking
about Claire.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.427
Claire's fine.

27:27.522 --> 27:30.730
She's safe, too,
and she'll stay that way.
I promise.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.858
Who is that?

27:37.949 --> 27:39.359
This is my friend.

27:40.368 --> 27:41.778
He's gonna make
everything okay.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.076
He'll help you
forget again.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.453
Again?
What do you mean, "again"?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.117
It's okay.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.076
Hold my hand.
lt'll all be over soon.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.924
MEREDITH: You could
stay a little longer,
have some dinner.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.055
I can't cook
worth crap but...

28:09.272 --> 28:11.058
Well, I was supposed
to be home a while ago.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.982
I got about six messages
from my dad telling me
to come home right away, so...

28:15.069 --> 28:16.479
He sounded pretty pissed.

28:16.571 --> 28:19.108
Hey.
This isn't goodbye,
you know that?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.582
I was hoping you could
tell me about my father.

28:35.631 --> 28:39.169
Well, that's complicated.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.678
Why don't you let me
work on that for next time?

28:51.314 --> 28:54.147
Here.
Little something
from Mexico.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.769
Oh, no, I can't.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.565
You can,
and you're gonna.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.485
It'll look 10 times
better on you than
it ever did on me.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.293
Isaac?

29:29.518 --> 29:30.507
(SIGHS)

29:42.198 --> 29:44.905
We haven't been
up here together
in a long time.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.109
There's something
about this roof.

29:48.204 --> 29:50.445
(CHUCKLES) You and I spent
a lot of time up here.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.452
I mean, it's connected
with what's happening.
It's important somehow.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.623
Well,
it's certainly mysterious.

29:55.711 --> 29:56.666
You know,
I never figured out

29:56.754 --> 29:57.994
how those pigeons
got up here.

29:58.547 --> 30:02.756
My father always said,
"If they found their way,
we ought to let them be."

30:06.889 --> 30:10.757
I know we had a lot together,
Isaac, for a long time.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.399
You saw it,
the painting of us.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.895
It's the future
I still hope for.

30:25.074 --> 30:28.532
This city took me in.
Everything important
that ever happened to me,

30:28.619 --> 30:29.825
happened here.
Good,

30:31.497 --> 30:32.612
bad,

30:32.790 --> 30:34.121
you.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.997
And now it's all
going to be destroyed
because I can't stop it.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.544
You don't know that.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.496
It keeps coming back,
worse every time.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.752
You saw what this
looks like after the bomb.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.334
The world will
never recover from that.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.880
That's not true.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.140
You can't lose hope.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.047
(SIGHS) What hope is there?

30:53.269 --> 30:55.476
There's you,
what you can do.

30:55.938 --> 30:59.977
Why else would you be allowed
to see the future unless it
was to do something about it?

31:00.776 --> 31:04.109
You can'tjust
see the future, Isaac.
You make it.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.316
You'll find a way.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.781
You really believe that?

31:10.619 --> 31:12.610
I believe in you.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.753
That's not possible.
Oh, it's more than possible.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.252
The charges against you
have been dropped,
Miss Sanders.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.333
What?

33:32.595 --> 33:34.756
The DA. threw out
the entire case.

33:34.930 --> 33:35.919
That can't happen.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.756
I killed people.

33:38.893 --> 33:42.556
Well, the state of Nevada
isn't so sure about
that anymore.

33:45.441 --> 33:48.103
confessed to all the crimes
you're accused of.

33:48.444 --> 33:52.858
DNA evidence
backed up everything.
Wonderful system, isn't it?

33:53.657 --> 33:57.275
As far as they're concerned,
justice has been served.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.412
And as far as Linderman
is concerned?

34:01.498 --> 34:04.661
Oh, don't worry about
tomorrow's problems today.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.291
No,

34:06.795 --> 34:08.296
I need to be in here.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.753
I need help.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.798
You only need to get dressed,
Miss Sanders.

34:13.302 --> 34:14.838
You're going home.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.633
No.

34:21.435 --> 34:26.304
That's the one you love,
off to dinner with the guy
she left to be with you.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.191
Sort of fickle,
don't you think?

34:28.359 --> 34:29.769
Why would you
show me that?

34:29.860 --> 34:34.274
I didn't show you anything.
She did. We just followed her,
not even very long.

34:35.032 --> 34:38.115
I'm sorry, Peter.
No, you're not.
You enjoyed that.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.909
You've got this
rosy film over your eyes,
like a kid.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.532
It's no wonder you live
like an adolescent.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.114
Posters on the wall,
hair in your face.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.824
You've got to see
the world as it is,

34:46.919 --> 34:47.999
it's the only way
you'll learn how
to save it.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.286
And, what,
be like you,
a hermit?

34:50.381 --> 34:51.712
No one knows you're alive
except for some pigeons.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.755
You have to get rid
of your distractions.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.219
The people I love
are not distractions.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.760
Then why can't you fly?
You've done it.
You're body remembers how.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.758
The only thing standing
in your way is you.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.714
What am I supposed to do,
cut them out of my life?

35:02.810 --> 35:04.175
How cold do you
expect me to be?

35:04.270 --> 35:05.476
Did you forget
you're a bomb?

35:05.562 --> 35:07.018
You've got to remember
what this is about,

35:07.106 --> 35:09.813
or do you have to ask
for your brother's
permission for that as well?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.277
Anything else
that I have to do?
You want to make a list?

35:12.361 --> 35:15.603
You're a sad cartoon
of a broken heart,
bleeding all over the place.

35:15.698 --> 35:16.983
I'm just trying to
get your mind straight.

35:17.074 --> 35:19.440
Look, I have followed
you around and listened
to your half-assed wisdom.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.277
You don't have
any answers, okay?
You don't know anything.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.408
You are afraid
of the world.
You have to listen to me.

35:25.499 --> 35:28.582
And I am tired
of you telling me
what I have to do!

35:28.669 --> 35:30.284
I don't have
to do anything!

35:30.379 --> 35:31.539
Except fly.

35:32.589 --> 35:33.624
(EXCLAIMS)

36:19.053 --> 36:20.168
Son of a bitch.

36:26.769 --> 36:29.636
Not quite what I was
expecting, but hope
for the flowers, yet.

36:33.692 --> 36:37.276
You threw me off
of a 30-story building.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.235
If I didn't regenerate,
I'd be dead.

36:39.323 --> 36:40.563
Well, you could
have flown.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.866
Listen, if you hadn't
have worked this one out,
you'd be hopeless anyway,

36:44.036 --> 36:45.742
and I'd have diffused
the biggest bomb ever.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.617
But you did it,
didn't you?

36:51.001 --> 36:54.118
You cleared your mind.
You called out your power.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.007
Right before
I hit the ground,

37:04.640 --> 37:07.052
when I knew what was
about to happen,
I had this flash

37:07.976 --> 37:10.638
in my head of this girl
that I met in Texas,

37:11.063 --> 37:13.145
this cheerleader.
She had healed herself.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.143
My God,
she's this sweet kid,

37:16.902 --> 37:19.143
sad little smile,
and she just...

37:25.244 --> 37:26.654
You were wrong.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.830
I don't have to cut her out.
I have to remember her.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.124
How she made me feel.
That's how I...

37:48.475 --> 37:51.308
Oh. Oh, God.
It's happening.

37:53.522 --> 37:54.682
I'm losing it.

37:59.987 --> 38:02.194
(SIGHS) Well, it's a start.

38:17.504 --> 38:18.493
Peter?

38:19.465 --> 38:20.921
(PHONE RINGING)

38:21.049 --> 38:22.880
Yes.
ISAAC: / think / found
a way to stop him.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.332
Ifound him.

38:24.553 --> 38:25.542
Sylar?

38:26.263 --> 38:29.551
I thought you had Sylar.
I will again, soon.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.345
Do you mean Petrelli?
Where is he?

38:32.436 --> 38:33.846
/ think heâ€™s been here
this whole time,

38:34.271 --> 38:35.351
and Iâ€™ve been painting him.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.680
Except no one can see him,
like he's a ghost, or...

38:39.151 --> 38:40.687
invisible.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.738
What does that mean?

38:45.657 --> 38:49.115
It means an old friend
isn't quite as dead
as we thought he was.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.693
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

39:53.809 --> 39:54.969
Huh?

39:59.439 --> 40:01.691
Mom, I know it's
not our game night,

40:01.775 --> 40:03.811
but can we play
a game of Scrabble?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.187
Since you just
got home?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.571
Absolutely.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.191
I owe you,
like, a dozen.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.488
Just give me
a minute, okay?

40:10.659 --> 40:11.865
Okay.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.997
(BANGING)

40:26.091 --> 40:27.297
No!

40:29.845 --> 40:31.631
What are you
so mad about, Niki?

40:31.722 --> 40:33.258
You're the one
who wanted to be locked up.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.434
I'm home!

40:43.567 --> 40:44.807
SANDRA: In the kitchen.

40:49.323 --> 40:52.065
You are in big trouble,
young lady.

40:54.328 --> 40:56.944
The school called.
Did you think
you could ditch,

40:57.039 --> 40:58.950
and I wouldn't
find out?

40:59.249 --> 41:00.864
Mom, we talked about it
this morning.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.787
Zach and I
went to the aquarium.

41:06.381 --> 41:11.546
Claire, I think I would
remember a conversation
about you skipping school.

41:12.846 --> 41:13.835
(MOANS)

41:13.930 --> 41:15.010
Are you okay?

41:15.098 --> 41:18.511
Fine, just banged my head
on something.

41:18.602 --> 41:20.012
Bit of a headache.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.562
Why don't you let me
finish setting the table,

41:24.650 --> 41:27.107
and you can go lie down
for a little bit?

41:28.153 --> 41:30.394
Don't think this
gets you off the hook.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.268
(PHONE RINGING)

42:06.066 --> 42:07.055
NA THAN: Hello ?

42:09.194 --> 42:10.604
You might not remember me.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.523
We haven't spoken
in a long time, but...

42:16.368 --> 42:17.949
our daughter
just found me.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.161
Did you hear
what I just said?

42:22.958 --> 42:24.164
She's alive.

42:25.419 --> 42:27.159
We need to talk, Nathan.
