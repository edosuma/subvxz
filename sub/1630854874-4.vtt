WEBVTT

00:31.664 --> 00:33.199
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.199 --> 00:33.967
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:33.967 --> 00:37.270
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.271
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:38.271 --> 00:38.838
US.

00:38.838 --> 00:39.372
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.006
THE MANHATTAN DA SIGNALED TRUMP

00:40.006 --> 00:40.573
MAY SOON BE CHARGED OVER THE

00:40.573 --> 00:42.008
STORMY DANIELS PAYMENTS AND

00:42.008 --> 00:43.476
SILICON VALLEY BANK COLLAPSED,

00:43.476 --> 00:45.512
IN ONE OF THE LARGEST BANK

00:45.512 --> 00:47.013
FAILURES IN U.S. HISTORY.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.681
BUT IF I MAY QUOTE GOD ON

00:48.681 --> 00:49.983
JUDGMENT DAY, I'D LIKE TO START

00:49.983 --> 00:51.751
WITH FOX NEWS.

00:51.751 --> 00:52.786
THE NETWORK THAT ANSWERS THE

00:52.786 --> 00:54.354
QUESTION, "WHAT WAS ON TV WHEN

00:54.354 --> 00:55.989
GRAMPA DIED?"

00:55.989 --> 00:57.257
WE TALKED A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT

00:57.257 --> 00:58.558
THE FACT THAT DOMINION VOTING

00:58.558 --> 01:00.260
SYSTEMS IS SUING FOX OVER ITS

01:00.260 --> 01:01.628
FALSE CLAIMS THAT DOMINION'S

01:01.628 --> 01:02.595
MACHINES HELPED SWING THE

01:02.595 --> 01:03.263
ELECTION FOR BIDEN.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.331
THANKS TO THAT LAWSUIT, THIS

01:05.331 --> 01:06.299
WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT EVEN

01:06.299 --> 01:07.600
RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONCERNED

01:07.600 --> 01:08.168
ABOUT THE TONE SOME OF HIS

01:08.168 --> 01:09.502
ANCHORS WERE TAKING.

01:09.502 --> 01:10.804
IN AN EMAIL TO CEO SUZANNE

01:10.804 --> 01:12.972
SCOTT, MURDOCH WROTE, "MAYBE

01:12.972 --> 01:13.640
SEAN HANNITY AND LAURA INGRAHAM

01:13.640 --> 01:16.342
WENT TOO FAR."

01:16.342 --> 01:17.243
AND WHEN DOMINION LAWYERS ASKED

01:17.243 --> 01:21.047
DURING HIS JANUARY DEPOSITION,

01:21.047 --> 01:21.714
"HAVE YOU EVER BELIEVED DOMINION

01:21.714 --> 01:22.615
WAS ENGAGED IN A MASSIVE AND

01:22.615 --> 01:24.984
COORDINATED EFFORT TO STEAL THE

01:24.984 --> 01:27.620
2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?"

01:27.620 --> 01:28.888
MURDOCH REPLIED, "NO."

01:28.888 --> 01:30.356
WOW, JUST A STRAIGHT UP

01:30.356 --> 01:32.358
"NO" FROM MURDOCH.

01:32.358 --> 01:33.460
ALTHOUGH HE'S AUSTRALIAN, SO IT

01:33.460 --> 01:35.895
WAS PROBABLY MORE OF A "NAH."

01:35.895 --> 01:38.465
AND I WILL SAY, OF COURSE SEAN

01:38.465 --> 01:39.766
HANNITY AND LAURA INGRAHAM WENT

01:39.766 --> 01:40.467
TOO FAR.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.101
THAT'S THEIR WHOLE THING.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.303
LAURA DELIVERS EVERY MONOLOGUE

01:43.303 --> 01:45.238
WITH THE ENERGY OF A CONCUSSED

01:45.238 --> 01:46.606
PTA PARENT AND HANNITY SPEWS

01:46.606 --> 01:48.308
BULLSHIT WHILE LOOKING LIKE ONE

01:48.308 --> 01:49.309
BIG NECK.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.678
YOU MADE THESE MONSTERS.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.213
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT SURPRISED,

01:53.213 --> 01:53.613
RUPERT.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.448
AND IT'S NOT JUST MURDOCH.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.316
TEXTS FROM TUCKER CARLSON SHOW

01:56.316 --> 01:57.417
THAT, FOR ALL HIS ON-AIR

01:57.417 --> 01:58.685
DEFENSES OF TRUMP, PRIVATELY, HE

01:58.685 --> 01:59.886
WAS TELLING A VERY DIFFERENT

01:59.886 --> 02:01.221
STORY.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.322
FOX HOSTS, INCLUDING TUCKER

02:02.322 --> 02:03.389
CARLSON, WERE INCREASINGLY

02:03.389 --> 02:05.191
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THAT

02:05.191 --> 02:08.228
TRUMP WAS LYING ABOUT THE 2020

02:08.228 --> 02:10.096
ELECTION.

02:10.096 --> 02:11.097
"WE ARE VERY, VERY CLOSE TO

02:11.097 --> 02:12.499
BEING ABLE TO IGNORE TRUMP MOST

02:12.499 --> 02:13.933
NIGHTS.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.568
I TRULY CAN'T WAIT," CARLSON

02:15.568 --> 02:18.738
TEXTED AN UNKNOWN PERSON ON

02:18.738 --> 02:20.874
JANUARY 4TH, 2021, ADDING, "I

02:20.874 --> 02:22.375
HATE HIM PASSIONATELY."

02:22.375 --> 02:24.110
OKAY, FIRST?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.713
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS.

02:26.713 --> 02:27.981
BUT GIRL, SAME.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.148
BUT ALSO, THAT'S SO HARSH, I'D

02:29.148 --> 02:31.684
ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR TRUMP IF I

02:31.684 --> 02:32.418
WASN'T SO SURE HE'S INCAPABLE OF

02:32.418 --> 02:33.820
FEELING ANYTHING BESIDES ANGER,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.588
HUNGER, AND THE LOWER BACK OF

02:35.588 --> 02:37.190
THE NEAREST BLONDE WOMAN.

02:37.190 --> 02:38.458
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.692
BECAUSE TUCKER GOES ON TO SAY,

02:39.692 --> 02:40.627
OF TRUMP'S TIME IN OFFICE,

02:40.627 --> 02:42.428
"WE'RE ALL PRETENDING WE'VE GOT

02:42.428 --> 02:43.863
A LOT TO SHOW FOR IT BECAUSE

02:43.863 --> 02:45.064
ADMITTING WHAT A DISASTER IT'S

02:45.064 --> 02:46.533
BEEN IS TOO TOUGH TO DIGEST.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.167
BUT COME ON, THERE ISN'T REALLY

02:48.167 --> 02:49.802
AN UPSIDE TO TRUMP."

02:49.802 --> 02:51.804
AND WOW.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.172
A MAN ON A "NEWS NETWORK" CAN'T

02:53.172 --> 02:55.608
BE AFRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH

02:55.608 --> 02:56.142
BECAUSE IT'S "TOO TOUGH TO

02:56.142 --> 02:58.678
DIGEST."

02:58.678 --> 02:59.312
THAT IS WHAT THE NEWS IS.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.346
IF ANCHORS DIDN'T REPORT WHAT

03:00.346 --> 03:02.081
WAS TOO TOUGH TO DIGEST,

03:02.081 --> 03:03.316
WALTER CRONKITE WOULD HAVE

03:03.316 --> 03:04.617
OPENED HIS MOST FAMOUS BROADCAST

03:04.617 --> 03:05.785
WITH, "THE PRESIDENT HAD A

03:05.785 --> 03:07.353
LOVELY CAR RIDE IN DALLAS TODAY.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.454
HIS HEAD FEELS BETTER THAN

03:08.454 --> 03:09.956
EVER!"

03:09.956 --> 03:11.591
AND I'M SURE MORE DETAILS WILL

03:11.591 --> 03:12.425
SPILL OUT OF THIS CASE IN THE

03:12.425 --> 03:13.526
MONTHS AHEAD.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.128
SO FOR NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TURN

03:15.128 --> 03:16.462
TO TENNESSEE, WHERE THIS WEEK,

03:16.462 --> 03:18.197
THE STATE LEGISLATURE MADE THE

03:18.197 --> 03:19.265
WORST KIND OF HISTORY.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.500
THIS WEEK TENNESSEE BECAME

03:20.500 --> 03:21.868
THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A LAW

03:21.868 --> 03:23.102
THAT WILL RESTRICT DRAG

03:23.102 --> 03:24.837
PERFORMANCES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY

03:24.837 --> 03:25.972
OR ANYWHERE A CHILD COULD SEE

03:25.972 --> 03:27.707
THEM.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.175
CONSERVATIVES SAY DRAG SHOWS

03:29.175 --> 03:30.977
EXPOSE CHILDREN TO SEXUALLY

03:30.977 --> 03:32.111
SUGGESTIVE CONTENT, WHILE

03:32.111 --> 03:33.680
PERFORMERS HERE SAY THE LAW IS

03:33.680 --> 03:34.847
DISCRIMINATORY, AND FEELS

03:34.847 --> 03:36.115
DESIGNED TO PUSH THEM BACK INTO

03:36.115 --> 03:37.216
THE CLOSET.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.885
YEAH, CONSERVATIVES

03:38.885 --> 03:40.119
HAVE SINGLED OUT DRAG SHOWS AS

03:40.119 --> 03:41.487
EXPOSING CHILDREN TO SEXUALLY

03:41.487 --> 03:42.755
SUGGESTIVE CONTENT.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.424
WHICH FEELS LIKE A VERY

03:44.424 --> 03:45.758
SELECTIVE APPLICATION OF

03:45.758 --> 03:47.226
OUTRAGE.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.561
I'M JUST SAYING, UNLESS THEY'VE

03:48.561 --> 03:49.862
ALSO CALLED OUT CARL'S JR.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.297
ADS, THIS ENTIRE RESTAURANT

03:51.297 --> 03:53.466
CHAIN, AND GLORIA'S RELENTLESS

03:53.466 --> 03:55.301
BUTT IN THE "MADAGASCAR" FILMS,

03:55.301 --> 03:57.537
THAT FEELS PRETTY TARGETED.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.606
THIS COMES ON THE BACK OF A

03:59.606 --> 04:01.374
NUMBER OF ANTI-LGBTQ BILLS, ALL

04:01.374 --> 04:02.609
DONE UNDER SENATE LEADER AND

04:02.609 --> 04:03.443
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

04:03.443 --> 04:04.410
RANDY McNally.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.578
A MAN WITH A HISTORY OF

04:05.578 --> 04:07.647
SUPPORTING ANTI-GAY LEGISLATION,

04:07.647 --> 04:08.581
INCLUDING RESTRICTING MARRIAGE

04:08.581 --> 04:09.682
TO BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.619
ALL OF WHICH MAKES WHAT EMERGED

04:12.619 --> 04:14.320
ABOUT McNally THIS WEEK

04:14.320 --> 04:14.821
ESPECIALLY HARD TO TAKE.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.855
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS,

04:15.855 --> 04:17.090
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAS BEEN

04:17.090 --> 04:18.558
REGULARLY COMMENTING ON THESE

04:18.558 --> 04:19.726
EXTREMELY RACY PICTURES OF AN

04:19.726 --> 04:21.327
INFLUENCER.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.962
EVERYTHING FROM TYPING OUT FIRE

04:22.962 --> 04:24.263
EMOJIS WHERE THE MALE USER HAD

04:24.263 --> 04:25.698
POSTED HIS BACKSIDE TO

04:25.698 --> 04:27.667
COMMENTING THAT HE HAS QUOTE "A

04:27.667 --> 04:29.402
SUPER LOOK" AND THAT HE LOVES

04:29.402 --> 04:30.870
HIS CONTENT.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.038
OKAY, FIRST, THERE'S

04:32.038 --> 04:33.506
NOTHING WRONG WITH COMMENTING ON

04:33.506 --> 04:34.774
A 20-YEAR OLD GAY MODEL'S THIRST

04:34.774 --> 04:35.875
TRAPS.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.176
BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM IF

04:37.176 --> 04:39.545
YOU'RE, A, 79 YEARS OLD.

04:39.545 --> 04:40.813
B, ARE A SITTING MEMBER OF

04:40.813 --> 04:41.748
GOVERNMENT THAT HELPED PASS

04:41.748 --> 04:43.616
ANTI-GAY LEGISLATION.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.351
AND C, LEAVE COMMENTS LIKE "YOU

04:45.351 --> 04:46.185
ARE HAVING A GRAND TIME MY

04:46.185 --> 04:47.553
FRIEND."

04:47.553 --> 04:49.288
BECAUSE YES, HE CLEARLY IS

04:49.288 --> 04:50.490
HAVING A GRAND TIME, BUT THAT'S

04:50.490 --> 04:51.758
FRANKLY NO THANKS TO PEOPLE LIKE

04:51.758 --> 04:53.459
YOU, RANDY!

04:53.459 --> 04:54.861
MCNALLY'S OFFICE RUSHED OUT A

04:54.861 --> 04:55.962
STATEMENT, SAYING, "AS ANYONE IN

04:55.962 --> 04:57.330
TENNESSEE POLITICS KNOWS,

04:57.330 --> 04:58.731
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR McNally IS A

04:58.731 --> 05:00.099
PROLIFIC SOCIAL MEDIA

05:00.099 --> 05:01.134
COMMENTER," "DOES HE ALWAYS USE

05:01.134 --> 05:02.435
THE PROPER EMOJI AT THE PROPER

05:02.435 --> 05:02.935
TIME?

05:02.935 --> 05:04.003
MAYBE NOT.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.805
BUT HE ENJOYS INTERACTING WITH

05:05.805 --> 05:06.806
CONSTITUENTS AND TENNESSEANS OF

05:06.806 --> 05:08.007
ALL RELIGIONS, BACKGROUNDS, AND

05:08.007 --> 05:09.442
ORIENTATIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA."

05:09.442 --> 05:10.877
ADDING, "HE HAS NO INTENTION OF

05:10.877 --> 05:12.512
STOPPING."

05:12.512 --> 05:13.846
WHICH, IF IT CAME FROM ANYONE

05:13.846 --> 05:15.181
ELSE, WOULD BE AN ICONIC

05:15.181 --> 05:16.315
RESPONSE.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.084
"I AM HORNY ON MAIN, AND WILL

05:18.084 --> 05:19.686
STAY THAT WAY TILL THE DAY I

05:19.686 --> 05:20.853
DIE?"

05:20.853 --> 05:22.355
IT'S EXQUISITE.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.489
BUT THE BEST RESPONSE TO THAT

05:23.489 --> 05:24.757
STATEMENT CAME FROM FRANKLYN,

05:24.757 --> 05:26.025
THE YOUNG MAN AT THE CENTER OF

05:26.025 --> 05:27.593
ALL THIS.

05:27.593 --> 05:28.728
BECAUSE THE OUTLET THAT

05:28.728 --> 05:30.029
INITIALLY BROKE THE STORY

05:30.029 --> 05:30.663
INTERVIEWED FRANKLYN TO GET HIS

05:30.663 --> 05:32.031
REACTION.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.032
I LIKE THAT HE HAS NO

05:33.032 --> 05:33.900
INTENTIONS OF STOPPING, I THINK

05:33.900 --> 05:35.334
THAT'S NICE, BUT YOU KNOW, I

05:35.334 --> 05:36.736
WOULD STILL, I WOULD JUST SAY,

05:36.736 --> 05:44.343
WHY BE KIND TO ONE GAY PERSON

05:44.343 --> 05:46.612
AND NOT EVERYONE?

05:46.612 --> 05:48.314
THE IDEA THAT RANDY'S NOW

05:48.314 --> 05:49.716
GONNA HIDE BEHIND, "OH, I'M JUST

05:49.716 --> 05:50.883
A GREAT-GRANDFATHER, I DON'T

05:50.883 --> 05:54.420
KNOW ABOUT EMOJIS."

05:54.420 --> 05:59.292
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE

05:59.292 --> 05:59.726
LOOKING AT A BUTT,

05:59.726 --> 06:00.626
GOVERNOR McNally.

06:00.626 --> 06:01.327
AND YOU KNEW WHOSE BUTT IT WAS.

06:01.327 --> 06:02.662
BUT MAYBE HE LIKED THE LIME

06:02.662 --> 06:04.397
GREEN COLOR!

06:04.397 --> 06:07.266
YEAH, MAYBE, FRANKLYN!

06:07.266 --> 06:07.900
I'VE GOTTA SAY, McNally IS LUCKY

06:07.900 --> 06:09.602
HE WAS COMMENTING ON THE PHOTOS

06:09.602 --> 06:10.570
OF SOMEONE SO KIND.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.072
FRANKLYN EVEN RESPONDED TO

06:13.072 --> 06:14.273
McNALLY'S THREE HEARTS AND FIRE

06:14.273 --> 06:17.810
EMOJIS WITH "YOU ARE LITERALLY

06:17.810 --> 06:18.911
ALWAYS SO NICE KING," WHEN HE'D

06:18.911 --> 06:19.779
HAVE BEEN WELL WITHIN HIS RIGHTS

06:19.779 --> 06:20.813
TO SAY, "YOU ARE 59 YEARS OLDER

06:20.813 --> 06:22.148
THAN ME AND YOU'RE

06:22.148 --> 06:22.715
SYSTEMATICALLY TRAMPLING MY

06:22.715 --> 06:23.783
RIGHTS.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.051
BLOCKED, REPORTED, AND I'M

06:25.051 --> 06:27.353
THROWING MY PHONE INTO THE SEA."

06:27.353 --> 06:28.421
INCREDIBLY, McNally ACTUALLY SAT

06:28.421 --> 06:30.490
DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW AMID ALL

06:30.490 --> 06:31.424
THIS, SAYING, "I, YOU KNOW, TRY

06:31.424 --> 06:33.159
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WITH POSTS."

06:33.159 --> 06:35.027
WHICH IS CERTAINLY A NICE THING

06:35.027 --> 06:35.695
TO DO!

06:35.695 --> 06:37.330
BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO CAPTURE ALL

06:37.330 --> 06:38.998
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON, ESPECIALLY

06:38.998 --> 06:40.733
WHEN YOU CONSIDER SOME OF THE

06:40.733 --> 06:42.168
POSTS IN QUESTION.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.402
THERE WAS ALSO THIS POST

06:43.402 --> 06:44.504
WHERE THE MAN SAID HE WAS,

06:44.504 --> 06:46.472
QUOTE, "NOT A WHORE BUT A HOE,

06:46.472 --> 06:48.007
ONE IS A SLUT, THE OTHER IS A

06:48.007 --> 06:50.810
PROSTITUTE," ADDING I'M THE ONE

06:50.810 --> 06:52.779
THAT GETS FREE WEED FOR GIVING,

06:52.779 --> 06:54.514
THEN A REFERENCE TO A SEXUAL

06:54.514 --> 06:56.916
ACT.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.884
AND IT WAS LIKED BY

06:57.884 --> 06:59.352
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR McNally.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.653
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT--

07:00.653 --> 07:03.489
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES ON SOME

07:03.489 --> 07:05.091
PEOPLE'S POSTS YOU SEE THE NAME

07:05.091 --> 07:06.492
AND YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE

07:06.492 --> 07:08.094
WRITTEN, AND YOU JUST PRESS THE

07:08.094 --> 07:09.495
BUTTON THAT SAYS "LIKE."

07:09.495 --> 07:11.764
SO YOU DIDN'T READ THAT POST?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.766
I DON'T RECALL READING THE

07:13.766 --> 07:16.502
PART ABOUT THE, THE UH, WEED.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.771
I KNOW THAT.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.539
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE

07:19.539 --> 07:21.207
"PROSTITUTE"?

07:21.207 --> 07:22.441
I MIGHT HAVE, I MIGHT HAVE

07:22.441 --> 07:25.511
READ THAT.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.781
RANDY!

07:28.781 --> 07:36.022
DID A WITCH PUT A SPELL ON YOU?

07:36.022 --> 07:42.228
I GENUINELY APPRECIATE THE

07:42.228 --> 07:44.430
TRANSPARENCY, BUT YOU KNOW YOU

07:44.430 --> 07:44.964
COULD JUST SAY NO, RIGHT?

07:44.964 --> 07:45.798
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE YOU ANY

07:45.798 --> 07:46.732
MORE OR LESS THAN THEY ALREADY

07:46.732 --> 07:47.500
DO.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.701
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE

07:48.701 --> 07:49.268
WEED PART IS JUST NOT WHAT

07:49.268 --> 07:50.036
ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN HERE.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.003
AND LOOK, I CAN'T SAY FOR

07:51.003 --> 07:51.704
CERTAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

07:51.704 --> 07:53.105
THAT GUY, BUT I WILL SAY

07:53.105 --> 07:54.307
WHENEVER STORIES LIKE THIS COME

07:54.307 --> 07:55.241
UP, AND THEY DO SEEM TO COME UP

07:55.241 --> 07:56.542
A LOT, OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS

07:56.542 --> 07:57.510
CHAMPIONING ANTI-GAY

07:57.510 --> 07:58.578
LEGISLATION, ONLY FOR IT TO

07:58.578 --> 07:59.645
EMERGE THEY MAY HAVE, LET'S CALL

07:59.645 --> 08:01.180
THEM, "GAY-ADJACENT

08:01.180 --> 08:02.648
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES,"

08:02.648 --> 08:03.382
IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL A MIXTURE

08:03.382 --> 08:04.584
OF EMOTIONS.

08:04.584 --> 08:05.551
FIRST, HILARITY AT THE

08:05.551 --> 08:06.285
HYPOCRISY.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.221
THEN, ANGER.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.889
THEN, A SLIGHT SENSE OF SADNESS.

08:09.889 --> 08:10.556
BECAUSE THESE ARE MEN WHO, YOU

08:10.556 --> 08:12.358
FEEL, COULD'VE HAD HAPPIER LIVES

08:12.358 --> 08:13.426
IF THEY'D GROWN UP IN A

08:13.426 --> 08:13.960
DIFFERENT WORLD.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.528
BUT INSTEAD OF HELPING CREATE

08:15.528 --> 08:17.263
THAT DIFFERENT WORLD, THEY'VE

08:17.263 --> 08:17.763
COURTED THE APPROVAL OF

08:17.763 --> 08:18.865
HOMOPHOBES WHO ARE INTENT ON

08:18.865 --> 08:19.932
HOLDING IT BACK.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.434
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE FOR

08:21.434 --> 08:24.036
McNally, IT ALL FEELS LIKE SUCH

08:24.036 --> 08:25.371
A WASTE, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT

08:25.371 --> 08:28.341
"RANDY McNally" IS JUST AN A+

08:28.341 --> 08:30.877
DRAG QUEEN NAME.

08:30.877 --> 08:31.677
AND HONESTLY, IN THE END, IT

08:31.677 --> 08:34.213
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT

08:34.213 --> 08:34.881
McNALLY'S DEAL IS, IF HE'S

08:34.881 --> 08:35.648
PUSHING FOR LAWS THAT HURT

08:35.648 --> 08:41.654
PEOPLE.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.288
RANDY, IF YOU'D INVEST HALF THE

08:42.288 --> 08:42.889
ENERGY YOU SPEND COMMENTING ON

08:42.889 --> 08:43.456
PHOTOS OF QUEER PEOPLE BEING

08:43.456 --> 08:44.090
HAPPY, INTO MAKING A WORLD WHERE

08:44.090 --> 08:45.191
THAT HAPPINESS IS NOT UNDER

08:45.191 --> 08:47.226
CONSTANT THREAT, THAT WOULD

08:47.226 --> 08:48.294
LITERALLY BE SO NICE, KING.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.663
AND NOW THIS.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.499
AND NOW,

08:53.499 --> 08:55.201
HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY

08:55.201 --> 08:57.136
FROM THE MEN OF LOCAL NEWS.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.786

09:13.786 --> 09:18.991

09:18.991 --> 09:20.293
SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE WOMAN IN

MY MOTHER.

NOT ONLY IS IT INTERNATIONAL

09:29.402 --> 09:29.702
WOMEN'S DAY.

09:29.702 --> 09:30.269
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING

09:30.269 --> 09:31.637
YET.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.138
WHAT?

09:32.138 --> 09:34.307
FOR WOMEN'S DAY.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.808
OH, AM I SUPPOSED TO?

09:35.808 --> 09:36.842
IS THERE AN INTERNATIONAL MAN'S

09:36.842 --> 09:43.649
DAY?

09:43.649 --> 09:44.116
HAPPY WOMEN'S DAY.

09:44.116 --> 09:44.617
NATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.217
YEAH, WE TOO.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.452
WE ARE WOMEN.

09:46.452 --> 09:47.019
OKAY.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.321
MY FAVORITE WOMEN.

09:48.321 --> 09:53.159
I AM SORRY, I AM SORRY.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.695
HEY, GIRLS, MY GIRLS, BUT YOU

09:58.097 --> 09:58.464
MY-- YOU KNOW.

09:58.464 --> 09:58.764
WELL.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.865
MOVING ON.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.467
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:01.467 --> 10:02.835
TANF.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.971
IT'S A COMMONLY USED ACRONYM

10:04.971 --> 10:05.938
THAT IN BRITAIN STANDS FOR "THAT

10:05.938 --> 10:07.173
ASSHOLE NIGEL FARAGE."

10:07.173 --> 10:09.041
BUT IN THIS COUNTRY, IT STANDS

10:09.041 --> 10:10.343
FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR

10:10.343 --> 10:11.877
NEEDY FAMILIES, A FEDERAL

10:11.877 --> 10:12.678
PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP

10:12.678 --> 10:13.579
FAMILIES WITH LITTLE TO NO

10:13.579 --> 10:15.181
INCOME.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.282
TANF IS AN ABSOLUTELY VITAL

10:16.282 --> 10:17.717
RESOURCE, AND ALSO THE PROGRAM

10:17.717 --> 10:19.485
UNDERNEATH MISSISSIPPI'S

10:19.485 --> 10:20.786
SPECTACULAR ONGOING SCANDALS

10:20.786 --> 10:21.954
INVOLVING FORMER QUARTERBACK

10:21.954 --> 10:22.955
BRETT FAVRE.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.590
NFL HALL OF FAMER BRETT FAVRE

10:24.590 --> 10:25.124
IS UNDER GROWING PRESSURE

10:25.124 --> 10:26.392
TONIGHT.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.227
AS A NEW COURT FILING SAYS THE

10:28.227 --> 10:30.329
FORMER FOOTBALL STAR WAGED A

10:30.329 --> 10:32.298
CAMPAIGN TO AGGRESSIVELY LOBBY,

10:32.298 --> 10:33.933
FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE

10:33.933 --> 10:35.968
STATE WELFARE AGENCY, TO FINISH

10:35.968 --> 10:37.303
BUILDING A VOLLEYBALL FACILITY

10:37.303 --> 10:38.804
AT HIS ALMA MATER, THE

10:38.804 --> 10:39.872
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

10:39.872 --> 10:40.940
MISSISSIPPI, WHERE HIS DAUGHTER

10:40.940 --> 10:41.407
PLAYED THE SPORT.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.641
THAT'S RIGHT, BRETT

10:42.641 --> 10:43.976
FAVRE WAS INVOLVED IN GETTING $5

10:43.976 --> 10:45.511
MILLION DOLLARS IN TANF FUNDS

10:45.511 --> 10:47.646
FUNNELED INTO BUILDING THIS

10:47.646 --> 10:48.481
VOLLEYBALL STADIUM.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.648
AND I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED YOU

10:49.648 --> 10:51.083
EVEN NEED A STADIUM TO PLAY

10:51.083 --> 10:52.218
VOLLEYBALL IN.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.286
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SPORT MAINLY

10:54.286 --> 10:54.854
PLAYED OUTDOORS BY SEXUALLY

10:54.854 --> 10:56.622
FRUSTRATED MEN WHO AREN'T

10:56.622 --> 10:58.057
WEARING SHIRTS AND SPORTY DOGS

10:58.057 --> 11:00.259
WHO UNEXPECTEDLY ARE.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.128
BUT CLEARLY, I WAS WRONG ABOUT

11:02.128 --> 11:02.728
THAT.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.529
BUT FAVRE'S ROLE IN THIS SCANDAL

11:03.529 --> 11:04.964
WENT FAR BEYOND VOLLEYBALL.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.099
HE'S ALSO ALLEGED TO HAVE HELPED

11:07.099 --> 11:08.200
GET AROUND $2 MILLION OF TANF

11:08.200 --> 11:09.735
DOLLARS ROUTED TO A

11:09.735 --> 11:10.369
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT HE

11:10.369 --> 11:11.470
INVESTED IN, AND PERSONALLY

11:11.470 --> 11:13.005
RECEIVED OVER A MILLION MORE FOR

11:13.005 --> 11:15.207
THE PROMISE HE'D MAKE PUBLIC

11:15.207 --> 11:16.742
APPEARANCES OR RECORD PSA'S.

11:16.742 --> 11:17.910
AND IN HIS TEXT MESSAGES TO A

11:17.910 --> 11:19.912
CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SCHEME, A

11:19.912 --> 11:21.080
WOMAN NAMED NANCY NEW, FAVRE

11:21.080 --> 11:23.149
SEEMED EAGER TO KEEP THE DETAILS

11:23.149 --> 11:24.350
OF THIS DEAL PRIVATE.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.851
TEXTS SHOW FAVRE WAS WORRIED

11:25.851 --> 11:27.553
ABOUT HOW IT MIGHT LOOK.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.954
HE WROTE, "IF YOU WERE TO PAY

11:28.954 --> 11:29.889
ME, IS THERE ANY WAY THE MEDIA

11:29.889 --> 11:31.690
CAN FIND OUT WHERE IT CAME FROM

11:31.690 --> 11:33.325
AND HOW MUCH?"

11:33.325 --> 11:34.827
NEW REPLIED, "NO."

11:34.827 --> 11:36.328
BUT ADDED, "I UNDERSTAND YOU

11:36.328 --> 11:37.396
BEING UNEASY ABOUT THAT."

11:37.396 --> 11:38.931
YEAH, ME TOO!

11:38.931 --> 11:40.399
BUT, BRETT, I HAVE SOME TERRIBLE

11:40.399 --> 11:41.033
NEWS FOR YOU.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.368
THE MEDIA DID FIND OUT.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.269
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

11:43.269 --> 11:45.471
NOW.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.505
BUT THE FAVRE PART OF THE STORY

11:46.505 --> 11:47.239
IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG

11:47.239 --> 11:48.607
HERE.

11:48.607 --> 11:49.608
BECAUSE AMAZINGLY, FROM 2016 TO

11:49.608 --> 11:54.513
2019, AT LEAST $77 MILLION

11:54.513 --> 11:56.015
DOLLARS IN FEDERAL WELFARE MONEY

11:56.015 --> 11:56.982
WAS STOLEN OR MISSPENT IN

11:56.982 --> 11:58.284
MISSISSIPPI.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.452
SIX PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRIMINALLY

11:59.452 --> 12:00.886
CHARGED SO FAR, WITH MOST

12:00.886 --> 12:01.987
PLEADING GUILTY, INCLUDING THE

12:01.987 --> 12:02.588
FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE STATE'S

12:02.588 --> 12:04.690
WELFARE AGENCY.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.358
THIS SCANDAL IS FULL OF BOTH

12:06.358 --> 12:08.027
BIZARRE DETAILS, AND A WEIRD

12:08.027 --> 12:10.496
NUMBER OF FORMER ATHLETES,

12:10.496 --> 12:13.899
INCLUDING RETIRED WWE WRESTLER

12:13.899 --> 12:14.467
TED "THE MILLION DOLLAR MAN"

12:14.467 --> 12:15.134
DIBIASE, SEEN HERE IN HIS

12:15.134 --> 12:17.536
HEYDAY, LOOKING VERY COOL.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.472
DIBIASE AND HIS MINISTRY

12:19.472 --> 12:20.673
APPARENTLY RECEIVED NEARLY

12:20.673 --> 12:21.807
$2 MILLION DOLLARS TO, AMONG

12:21.807 --> 12:23.175
OTHER THINGS, CREATE A PHONE APP

12:23.175 --> 12:25.077
TO REACH TROUBLED TEENS AND SEND

12:25.077 --> 12:26.078
THEM BIBLE VERSES, SOMETHING

12:26.078 --> 12:27.446
THAT APPARENTLY NEVER HAPPENED.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.881
WHICH IS PROBABLY JUST AS WELL,

12:28.881 --> 12:29.982
GIVEN THAT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

12:29.982 --> 12:31.350
THIS MAN HELPING ANY TEEN WHO'S

12:31.350 --> 12:32.351
IN TROUBLE.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.285
UNLESS THE THING THEY'RE HAVING

12:33.285 --> 12:34.286
TROUBLE WITH IS FIGURING OUT

12:34.286 --> 12:35.554
WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF

12:35.554 --> 12:36.455
STEVEN SEAGAL SOMEHOW AGED EVEN

12:36.455 --> 12:39.091
WORSE.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.093
AND LOOK, LEGALLY, I HAVE TO

12:41.093 --> 12:42.661
TELL YOU THAT BOTH FAVRE AND

12:42.661 --> 12:43.629
DIBIASE MAINTAIN THEY DID

12:43.629 --> 12:44.964
NOTHING WRONG, AND HAVE NOT BEEN

12:44.964 --> 12:46.332
CRIMINALLY CHARGED.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.700
AND FAVRE WANTS US TO TELL YOU

12:47.700 --> 12:49.268
THAT HE RETURNED THE $1.1

12:49.268 --> 12:50.402
MILLION HE WAS PERSONALLY PAID,

12:50.402 --> 12:51.971
AND SAYS HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF

12:51.971 --> 12:53.339
THE MONEY WAS COMING FROM

12:53.339 --> 12:53.839
WELFARE FUNDS.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.809
ALTHOUGH, IT'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY

12:56.809 --> 12:57.610
WHERE HE THOUGHT THE MONEY WAS

12:57.610 --> 12:58.077
COMING FROM.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.044
PERHAPS HE THINKS THERE'S SOME

12:59.044 --> 13:00.579
POT OF TAXPAYER MONEY THAT HE

13:00.579 --> 13:02.047
CAN JUST DIP HIS SAUSAGE FINGERS

13:02.047 --> 13:02.815
INTO WHENEVER HE NEEDS

13:02.815 --> 13:03.182
SOMETHING.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.250
I DON'T KNOW.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.851
HE'S BEEN HIT IN THE HEAD A LOT.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.720
NOT ENOUGH, BUT A LOT.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.088
BUT WHAT'S NOT IN DISPUTE HERE

13:09.088 --> 13:10.756
IS THAT, FOR YEARS, THERE WERE

13:10.756 --> 13:11.891
PEOPLE IN MISSISSIPPI IN DIRE

13:11.891 --> 13:13.058
NEED OF HELP, WHO JUST COULDN'T

13:13.058 --> 13:14.493
GET IT.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.028
TAMARA EDWARDS RAISED FOUR

13:16.028 --> 13:17.863
CHILDREN ON HER OWN IN

13:17.863 --> 13:19.698
MISSISSIPPI, APPLYING FOR

13:19.698 --> 13:21.167
WELFARE BENEFITS JUST ONCE, FOR

13:21.167 --> 13:22.434
CHILDCARE WHILE SHE WORKED.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.137
WHEN I REAPPLIED, I WAS NOT

13:25.137 --> 13:28.274
ABLE TO BE ON IT AGAIN BECAUSE

13:28.274 --> 13:29.975
THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T

13:29.975 --> 13:31.877
HAVE THE FUNDINGS FOR IT.

13:31.877 --> 13:32.878
THAT'S PRETTY

13:32.878 --> 13:34.046
INFURIATING TO HEAR.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.080
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU

13:35.080 --> 13:35.915
LEARN THAT, IN MISSISSIPPI LAST

13:35.915 --> 13:38.851
YEAR, OF ROUGHLY 190,000

13:38.851 --> 13:42.521
CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY, JUST

13:42.521 --> 13:43.789
2,600 WERE RECEIVING MONEY FROM

13:43.789 --> 13:45.191
TANF, WHILE, REMEMBER, OF THE

13:45.191 --> 13:46.425
ROUGHLY ONE BRETT FAVRES IN

13:46.425 --> 13:48.460
MISSISSIPPI, 100% OF THEM

13:48.460 --> 13:49.895
MANAGED TO GET $5 MILLION FOR

13:49.895 --> 13:51.830
THIS FUCKING VOLLEYBALL STADIUM.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.032
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO

13:53.032 --> 13:54.033
SEE BRETT FAVRE HIT IN THE NUTS

13:54.033 --> 13:55.601
WITH A FOOTBALL, AND THE GOOD

13:55.601 --> 13:58.304
NEWS IS, I CAN ACTUALLY HELP

13:58.304 --> 13:58.871
YOU THERE.

13:58.871 --> 13:59.838
HE WAS ON THE PRACTICE FIELD

13:59.838 --> 14:02.308
THIS WEEK AND GOT HIT IN THE

14:02.308 --> 14:04.009
NOT-SO-FRIENDLY AREA.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.244
OH!

14:05.244 --> 14:09.281
IT TAKES HIM ALL THE WAY DOWN.

14:09.748 --> 14:10.316
GOOD.

14:10.316 --> 14:10.849
I'M GLAD THAT HAPPENED.

14:10.849 --> 14:11.984
AND BY THE WAY, KUDOS TO THE

14:11.984 --> 14:13.018
LOCAL NEWS TEAM FOR ADDING THE

14:13.018 --> 14:14.253
"BOING" SOUND EFFECT.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.387
EXCELLENT JOURNALISM.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.523
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

14:17.523 --> 14:18.490
WHILE WHAT HAPPENED IN

14:18.490 --> 14:20.259
MISSISSIPPI ROSE TO CRIMINAL

14:20.259 --> 14:21.894
CHARGES, IN STATES ALL OVER THE

14:21.894 --> 14:23.229
COUNTRY, THE TANF PROGRAM HAS

14:23.229 --> 14:24.196
BEEN ABUSED FOR DECADES, AND

14:24.196 --> 14:26.832
COMPLETELY LEGALLY.

14:26.832 --> 14:28.234
IN FACT, NATIONWIDE, FOR EVERY

14:28.234 --> 14:31.370
100 FAMILIES IN POVERTY, ONLY 21

14:31.370 --> 14:32.705
RECEIVED TANF CASH ASSISTANCE.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.872
MEANING WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S

14:33.872 --> 14:35.441
SUPPOSED TO GIVE MONEY TO

14:35.441 --> 14:37.009
FAMILIES IN DESPERATE NEED, AND

14:37.009 --> 14:38.978
FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THEM JUST

14:38.978 --> 14:40.312
AREN'T GETTING IT.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.914
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

14:41.914 --> 14:43.082
TANF, AND LET'S START WITH WHY

14:43.082 --> 14:44.283
IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.352
TANF IS THE ONLY FEDERAL

14:46.352 --> 14:47.052
ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAM THAT

14:47.052 --> 14:47.620
PROVIDES MONTHLY CASH

14:47.620 --> 14:49.555
ASSISTANCE.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.791
THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFERENT

14:52.791 --> 14:54.393
FROM SAY, SNAP, FORMERLY KNOWN

14:54.393 --> 14:55.594
AS "FOOD STAMPS," BECAUSE THAT

14:55.594 --> 14:58.063
CAN ONLY BE USED TO PAY FOR

14:58.063 --> 15:00.699
FOOD, WHEREAS TANF FUNDS, BY

15:00.699 --> 15:02.401
CONTRAST, CAN BE USED FOR ALL

15:02.401 --> 15:03.636
SORTS OF OTHER NECESSITIES, FROM

15:03.636 --> 15:05.070
DIAPERS, TO TOOTHPASTE, TO

15:05.070 --> 15:05.537
UTILITY BILLS.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.138
SO IT CAN BE AN ABSOLUTE

15:06.138 --> 15:07.139
LIFELINE FOR FAMILIES.

15:07.139 --> 15:07.706
AND THE TRUTH IS, WE'VE LONG

15:07.706 --> 15:09.108
KNOWN JUST HOW IMPORTANT CASH

15:09.108 --> 15:09.775
ASSISTANCE CAN BE.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.343
IN 1935, FDR PUSHED FOR THE AID

15:11.343 --> 15:13.045
TO DEPENDENT CHILDREN PROGRAM.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.847
AND BACK THEN, THE IDEA HAD

15:14.847 --> 15:16.215
BROAD SUPPORT.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.583
THE WELFARE OF THE NATION

15:17.583 --> 15:19.318
DEPENDS UPON THE WELFARE OF ITS

15:19.318 --> 15:20.152
CHILDREN!

15:20.152 --> 15:21.720
TO PROVIDE FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE

15:21.720 --> 15:22.821
LOST THEIR BREADWINNERS, THE

15:22.821 --> 15:25.591
STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

15:25.591 --> 15:26.558
PROVIDE MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS SO

15:26.558 --> 15:27.893
THAT THESE CHILDREN MAY GROW UP

15:27.893 --> 15:31.196
AT HOME WITH THEIR OWN FAMILIES.

15:31.196 --> 15:31.864
AID FOR CHILDREN WHO, AS

15:31.864 --> 15:34.900
CITIZENS OF TOMORROW, NEED THE

15:34.900 --> 15:35.434
SECURITY OF HOME TODAY!

15:35.434 --> 15:36.935
WOW!

15:36.935 --> 15:38.070
IT'S GENUINELY REFRESHING TO

15:38.070 --> 15:39.672
HEAR THAT KIND OF VOICE SAYING

15:39.672 --> 15:40.739
SUCH NICE THINGS.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.508
ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE TIME, I'M

15:42.508 --> 15:43.409
GUESSING IF HE'D KEPT TALKING,

15:43.409 --> 15:44.743
HE WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING LIKE,

15:44.743 --> 15:46.211
"ALSO, NOTHING CALMS A

15:46.211 --> 15:47.646
HYSTERICAL CHILD LIKE A GOOD

15:47.646 --> 15:49.682
SMACK WITH A STICK."

15:49.682 --> 15:51.050
THAT PROGRAM CONTINUED TO HAVE

15:51.050 --> 15:51.717
SUPPORT FOR YEARS, WHILE--

15:51.717 --> 15:53.485
PERHAPS NOT COINCIDENTALLY-- IT

15:53.485 --> 15:55.454
WAS PRIMARILY WHITE FAMILIES,

15:55.454 --> 15:56.655
LIKE THOSE YOU JUST SAW, WHO

15:56.655 --> 15:57.990
WERE THE ONES USING IT.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.024
BUT AS BARRIERS PREVENTING BLACK

15:59.024 --> 16:00.459
FAMILIES FROM PARTICIPATING

16:00.459 --> 16:02.995
BEGAN TO FALL, PEOPLE SUDDENLY

16:02.995 --> 16:03.862
BEGAN TO PANIC ABOUT WHETHER

16:03.862 --> 16:05.531
THESE PROGRAMS MIGHT ACTUALLY

16:05.531 --> 16:06.665
ENCOURAGE LAZINESS AND

16:06.665 --> 16:07.633
DEPENDENCY.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.702
AND, TO USE AMERICA'S OFFICIAL

16:09.702 --> 16:11.203
SLOGAN, RONALD REAGAN MADE IT

16:11.203 --> 16:13.038
WORSE!

16:13.038 --> 16:14.206
BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES IN THE

16:14.206 --> 16:15.941
'70S AND '80S, LED BY REAGAN,

16:15.941 --> 16:17.309
PUSHED LARGELY BULLSHIT OR

16:17.309 --> 16:18.544
CHERRY-PICKED NARRATIVES OF

16:18.544 --> 16:19.578
FRAUD AND ABUSE.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.680
IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE, BY

16:21.680 --> 16:22.314
THE MID-'90S, ONE FLORIDA

16:22.314 --> 16:24.016
REPRESENTATIVE FOUND THIS A

16:24.016 --> 16:26.418
COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE WAY TO

16:26.418 --> 16:27.086
TALK ABOUT WELFARE RECIPIENTS.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.721
WE POST THESE SIGNS FOR

16:28.721 --> 16:30.189
SEVERAL REASONS.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.824
FIRST, BECAUSE IF LEFT IN A

16:31.824 --> 16:34.360
NATURAL STATE, ALLIGATORS CAN

16:34.360 --> 16:35.961
FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.229
THEY WORK, GATHER FOOD, AND CARE

16:37.229 --> 16:39.031
FOR THEIR YOUNG.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.834
SECONDLY, WE POST THESE WARNINGS

16:41.834 --> 16:44.269
BECAUSE UNNATURAL FEEDING AND

16:44.269 --> 16:45.771
ARTIFICIAL CARE CREATES

16:45.771 --> 16:48.407
DEPENDENCY.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.676
WHEN DEPENDENCY SETS IN, THESE

16:50.676 --> 16:53.045
OTHERWISE ABLED ALLIGATORS CAN

16:53.045 --> 16:55.147
NO LONGER SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.715
NOW I KNOW PEOPLE ARE NOT

16:56.715 --> 16:58.083
ALLIGATORS, BUT I SUBMIT TO YOU

16:58.083 --> 17:02.154
THAT WITH OUR CURRENT HANDOUT,

17:02.154 --> 17:04.957
NON-WORK WELFARE SYSTEM, WE'VE

17:04.957 --> 17:05.891
UPSET THE NATURAL ORDER.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.259
OKAY.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.628
THERE IS A LOT TO UNPACK THERE.

17:09.628 --> 17:10.195
FROM CASUALLY COMPARING POOR

17:10.195 --> 17:11.263
PEOPLE TO ANIMALS, TO CLAIMING

17:11.263 --> 17:12.631
THAT ALLIGATORS WORK, WHICH BEGS

17:12.631 --> 17:14.566
THE QUESTION, THE FUCK ARE YOU

17:14.566 --> 17:15.601
TALKING ABOUT?

17:15.601 --> 17:17.102
ALLIGATORS DON'T HAVE JOBS!

17:17.102 --> 17:18.070
UNLESS YOU CONSIDER "LOOKING

17:18.070 --> 17:20.239
LIKE SOMEONE PUT A DRAGON BABY

17:20.239 --> 17:21.140
INTO A PANINI PRESS" TO BE A

17:21.140 --> 17:27.913
JOB, IN WHICH CASE, YES, THEY'RE

17:27.913 --> 17:28.547
INDEED WORKING 24/7.

17:28.547 --> 17:29.181
NOW AT THE TIME THAT ASSHOLE WAS

17:29.181 --> 17:30.015
SPEAKING, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

17:30.015 --> 17:31.216
HAD ALREADY BEGUN ALLOWING, AND

17:31.216 --> 17:32.518
ENCOURAGING, STATES TO

17:32.518 --> 17:33.786
EXPERIMENT WITH VARIOUS

17:33.786 --> 17:34.820
SO-CALLED "WELFARE-TO-WORK"

17:34.820 --> 17:36.155
APPROACHES, WITH THE AIM BEING

17:36.155 --> 17:37.289
TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE OFF

17:37.289 --> 17:37.790
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AS

17:37.790 --> 17:39.291
POSSIBLE, AND INTO THE

17:39.291 --> 17:40.392
WORKFORCE.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.593
AND BACK THEN, BOTH DEMOCRATS

17:41.593 --> 17:42.694
AND REPUBLICANS SEIZED ON WHAT

17:42.694 --> 17:43.996
APPEARED TO BE A SUCCESSFUL

17:43.996 --> 17:44.863
PROGRAM IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY,

17:44.863 --> 17:46.498
CALIFORNIA, THAT EMPHASIZED

17:46.498 --> 17:47.966
GETTING A JOB ABOVE ALL ELSE,

17:47.966 --> 17:50.536
AND WAS SAID TO HAVE INCREASED

17:50.536 --> 17:51.170
PARTICIPANTS' EARNINGS BY NEARLY

17:51.170 --> 17:52.438
50%.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.640
THE MAN OVERSEEING THAT PROGRAM,

17:54.640 --> 17:55.240
LARRY TOWNSEND, WAS CELEBRATED

17:55.240 --> 17:56.408
AT THE TIME.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.709
EVEN DUBBED "THE MAGIC

17:57.709 --> 17:58.777
BUREAUCRAT," AND WAS BROUGHT

17:58.777 --> 18:00.679
BEFORE CONGRESS TO SHARE THE

18:00.679 --> 18:02.247
SECRETS TO HIS SUCCESS.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.348
IF YOU CALL RIVERSIDE COUNTY,

18:03.348 --> 18:04.650
AND NOBODY ANSWERS THE PHONE,

18:04.650 --> 18:06.218
YOU'LL GET A WORK ETHIC MESSAGE.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.287
WE HAVE POSTERS IN THE WAITING

18:08.287 --> 18:09.087
ROOM.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.423
WE HAVE PRODUCED A COMPACT DISC

18:11.423 --> 18:17.229
WITH WORK ETHIC MUSIC.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.730
ONE OF THE-- THE PIECES OF

18:18.730 --> 18:20.566
MUSIC IS WELFARE IS TEMPORARY,

18:20.566 --> 18:21.166
NOT A WAY OF LIFE, AND IT'S A

18:21.166 --> 18:24.770
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.370
NOW, THAT'S ACTUALLY

18:25.370 --> 18:25.804
TRUE!

18:25.804 --> 18:26.472
LARRY OVERSAW THE PRODUCTION OF

18:26.472 --> 18:27.406
THIS ALBUM OF "WORK ETHIC MUSIC"

18:27.406 --> 18:28.474
THEY'D PLAY IN THE OFFICE, AND

18:28.474 --> 18:29.775
TO PEOPLE WHO WERE PUT ON HOLD.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.909
NOW, IS HE RIGHT TO CLAIM IT WAS

18:30.909 --> 18:33.779
"A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MUSIC?"

18:33.779 --> 18:34.480
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU BE THE

18:34.480 --> 18:34.980
JUDGE?

18:34.980 --> 18:35.614
HERE'S A TASTE.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.250
AND IF YOU THINK EVERY TRACK ON

19:11.250 --> 19:13.051
THE ALBUM WAS CONFINED TO THE

GENRE OF "POP SOUL BALLAD,"

19:13.619 --> 19:14.620
YOU'RE WRONG.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.345
UNDER THE MASKS WERE

KEVIN O'LEARY AND MARK CUBAN.

WORSE.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.716
NOW, INTERESTINGLY, AND

20:17.716 --> 20:19.217
IMPORTANTLY, LATER STUDIES FOUND

20:19.217 --> 20:20.852
THAT MAN'S PROGRAM DIDN'T, IN

20:20.852 --> 20:21.620
FACT, SUCCEED BECAUSE OF THAT

20:21.620 --> 20:22.988
ALBUM.

20:22.988 --> 20:23.622
OR, INDEED, ANYTHING ELSE HE'D

20:23.622 --> 20:25.057
DONE.

20:25.057 --> 20:25.691
INSTEAD, RESEARCH SUGGESTED ITS

20:25.691 --> 20:27.025
SUCCESS WAS A FLUKE, AND

20:27.025 --> 20:28.226
ACTUALLY THE PRODUCT OF AN

20:28.226 --> 20:30.028
ALREADY STRONGER LOCAL ECONOMY

20:30.028 --> 20:31.930
RATHER THAN ANY REFORMS.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.399
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS, THE WHOLE

20:34.399 --> 20:35.567
CONCEPT OF "WELFARE-TO-WORK" HAD

20:35.567 --> 20:37.369
CAUGHT ON IN A BIG WAY.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.971
BILL CLINTON CAMPAIGNED

20:38.971 --> 20:39.938
AGGRESSIVELY ON WELFARE REFORM,

20:39.938 --> 20:41.106
AND ONCE IN OFFICE, WORKED WITH

20:41.106 --> 20:42.674
REPUBLICANS TO CRAFT A BILL

20:42.674 --> 20:44.109
THAT, HE BRAGGED WHEN SIGNING

20:44.109 --> 20:46.078
IT, WOULD MOVE MILLIONS INTO THE

20:46.078 --> 20:46.979
WORKFORCE.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.246
TODAY WE ARE ENDING WELFARE

20:48.246 --> 20:50.349
AS WE KNOW IT.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.817
BUT I HOPE THIS DAY WILL BE

20:51.817 --> 20:53.986
REMEMBERED NOT FOR WHAT IT ENDED

20:53.986 --> 20:56.021
BUT FOR WHAT IT BEGAN.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.022
SPOILER ALERT, IT'S

20:57.022 --> 20:58.223
REMEMBERED FOR WHAT IT ENDED,

20:58.223 --> 21:00.726
NOT WHAT IT BEGAN.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.960
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO THINK OF

21:01.960 --> 21:04.496
A CLIP FROM THE CLINTON ERA

21:04.496 --> 21:05.330
THAT'S AGED WORSE, OTHER THAN,

21:05.330 --> 21:06.832
OF COURSE, THIS ONE FROM HIS

21:06.832 --> 21:07.265
INAUGURAL BALL.

21:07.265 --> 21:08.867
WE'LL BE THERE FOR YOU, WE

21:08.867 --> 21:10.702
LOVE YOU, THANK YOU, GOD BLESS

21:10.702 --> 21:13.005
YOU ALL, THANK YOU.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.207
AND THANK YOU, KEVIN SPACEY!

21:15.207 --> 21:19.945
YEAH, YEAH.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.512
YEAH.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.346
PRETTY REMARKABLE, RIGHT?

21:21.346 --> 21:22.414
THAT THEY LET THAT SEXUAL

21:22.414 --> 21:23.115
PREDATOR ANYWHERE NEAR KEVIN

21:23.115 --> 21:25.951
SPACEY?

21:26.518 --> 21:27.419
THE POINT IS THAT CLINTON'S

21:27.419 --> 21:28.887
WELFARE REFORM CREATED THE TANF

21:28.887 --> 21:29.721
PROGRAM.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.756
AND IN DOING SO, IT BROUGHT

21:30.756 --> 21:31.823
ABOUT SOME MAJOR, AND

21:31.823 --> 21:33.325
CATASTROPHIC CHANGES.

21:33.325 --> 21:34.593
FIRST, IT SHIFTED THE FUNDING TO

21:34.593 --> 21:35.627
A BLOCK GRANT.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.029
BASICALLY, INSTEAD OF THE

21:37.029 --> 21:38.263
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING

21:38.263 --> 21:39.598
OVERSIGHT AND SHARING THE COSTS

21:39.598 --> 21:40.766
OF THE PROGRAM, EACH YEAR, IT

21:40.766 --> 21:42.367
WOULD JUST GIVE STATES A LUMP

21:42.367 --> 21:43.535
SUM OF MONEY.

21:43.535 --> 21:44.903
BUT IN DOING SO, IT CRUCIALLY

21:44.903 --> 21:46.605
DIDN'T ESTABLISH ANY MECHANISM

21:46.605 --> 21:48.206
TO INCREASE THAT SUM OVER TIME,

21:48.206 --> 21:49.608
MEANING THE AMOUNT EACH STATE

21:49.608 --> 21:50.842
GETS HAS NOT INCREASED SINCE

21:50.842 --> 21:53.245
1996.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.446
AND BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN

21:54.446 --> 21:55.947
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION OR

21:55.947 --> 21:56.615
POPULATION CHANGES, THE REAL

21:56.615 --> 21:58.250
VALUE OF THE FUNDING HAS

21:58.250 --> 22:00.085
ACTUALLY FALLEN BY 40% SINCE

22:00.085 --> 22:01.319
THEN.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.622
SO IT WASN'T WORTH MUCH IN THE

22:03.622 --> 22:04.690
MID-'90S, AND IT'S WORTH EVEN

22:04.690 --> 22:06.291
LESS NOW.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.093
THINK OF IT LIKE A CASSINGLE OF

22:08.093 --> 22:09.628
CHUMBAWUMBA'S TUBTHUMPING.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.629
AND I KNOW IF YOU'RE UNDER 30

22:10.629 --> 22:11.897
YOU THINK I'M HAVING A STROKE,

22:11.897 --> 22:14.833
BUT I SWEAR EVERYTHING I JUST

22:14.833 --> 22:16.101
SAID IS A REAL WORD.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.936
THE BIG PROMISE OF THESE BLOCK

22:17.936 --> 22:19.004
GRANTS WAS THAT THEY'D GIVE

22:19.004 --> 22:20.238
STATES THE FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND

22:20.238 --> 22:21.540
IT HOWEVER THEY FELT WORKED BEST

22:21.540 --> 22:22.674
FOR THEM.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.875
THE ONLY REAL REQUIREMENT WAS

22:23.875 --> 22:24.976
THAT IT HAD TO BE USED FOR AT

22:24.976 --> 22:26.878
LEAST ONE OF FOUR INCREDIBLY

22:26.878 --> 22:28.180
BROAD PURPOSES.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.548
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY

22:29.548 --> 22:30.682
FAMILIES SO THAT CHILDREN CAN BE

22:30.682 --> 22:31.983
CARED FOR IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR

22:31.983 --> 22:32.951
IN THE HOMES OF RELATIVES.

22:32.951 --> 22:33.752
FINE.

22:33.752 --> 22:35.087
PROMOTING JOB PREPARATION, WORK,

22:35.087 --> 22:35.987
AND MARRIAGE.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.422
OKAY.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.790
PREVENTING AND REDUCING THE

22:38.790 --> 22:39.825
INCIDENCE OF OUT-OF-WEDLOCK

22:39.825 --> 22:40.826
PREGNANCIES.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.194
SEEMS A BIT WEIRD!

22:42.194 --> 22:43.295
AND ENCOURAGING THE FORMATION

22:43.295 --> 22:44.396
AND MAINTENANCE OF TWO-PARENT

22:44.396 --> 22:45.397
FAMILIES.

22:45.397 --> 22:46.865
SO IMMEDIATELY, YOU CAN SEE THAT

22:46.865 --> 22:48.834
NOT ONLY IS SOME OF THAT

22:48.834 --> 22:50.102
INCREDIBLY MORALISTIC, IT'S,

22:50.102 --> 22:50.836
CRUCIALLY, A PRETTY BROAD

22:50.836 --> 22:52.370
MANDATE.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.572
AND STATES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE

22:53.572 --> 22:54.606
OF THAT LATITUDE.

22:54.606 --> 22:55.941
FOR INSTANCE, SOME HAVE

22:55.941 --> 22:56.641
APPROPRIATED TANF MONEY FOR

22:56.641 --> 22:58.076
COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS THAT CAN

22:58.076 --> 22:59.211
END UP GOING TO MIDDLE-CLASS

22:59.211 --> 23:00.278
STUDENTS.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.648
SINCE 2007, MICHIGAN HAS SPENT

23:03.648 --> 23:05.951
AROUND $100 MILLION DOLLARS EACH

23:05.951 --> 23:07.352
YEAR IN WELFARE MONEY ON COLLEGE

23:07.352 --> 23:08.787
AID, MUCH OF IT BENEFITING

23:08.787 --> 23:09.621
FAMILIES WELL ABOVE THE POVERTY

23:09.621 --> 23:11.156
LINE.

23:11.156 --> 23:11.990
AND THE STATE HAS JUSTIFIED THIS

23:11.990 --> 23:14.359
BY SAYING THAT COLLEGE AID HELPS

23:14.359 --> 23:15.427
PREVENT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK

23:15.427 --> 23:16.194
PREGNANCIES, WHICH OF COURSE

23:16.194 --> 23:17.963
MAKES SENSE.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.331
COLLEGE IS FAMOUSLY A PLACE

23:19.331 --> 23:22.567
WHERE NO ONE FUCKS.

23:23.268 --> 23:23.902
MEANWHILE, OKLAHOMA WAS, AT ONE

23:23.902 --> 23:24.970
POINT, SPENDING MILLIONS IN TANF

23:24.970 --> 23:26.471
DOLLARS ON MARRIAGE COUNSELING

23:26.471 --> 23:27.639
CLASSES, INCLUDING ONE CALLED

23:27.639 --> 23:28.240
"FOREVER.

23:28.240 --> 23:28.940
FOR REAL."

23:28.940 --> 23:29.741
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE AN AD FOR

23:29.741 --> 23:31.042
IT?

23:31.042 --> 23:33.145
WELL, TOO BAD, HERE IT IS!

23:33.145 --> 23:34.079
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

23:34.079 --> 23:34.913
DECISION YOU CAN MAKE IN YOUR

23:34.913 --> 23:37.949
LIFE, TO MARRY SOMEBODY.

23:37.949 --> 23:38.917
SO, YOU KNOW, WHO WOULDN'T WANT

23:38.917 --> 23:39.384
A CLOSER AND STRONGER

23:39.384 --> 23:40.185
RELATIONSHIP?

23:40.185 --> 23:41.520
ONCE WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE

23:41.520 --> 23:42.721
READY TO MOVE FORWARD IN OUR

23:42.721 --> 23:44.856
RELATIONSHIP, WE WANTED TO

23:44.856 --> 23:45.624
PROTECT WHAT WE HAD.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.259
AND SO, WE DECIDED TO GO TO

23:47.259 --> 23:47.826
"FOREVER.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.161
FOR REAL."

23:49.161 --> 23:50.295
FOR AN INVESTMENT IN US.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.396
WE KNOW THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP

23:51.396 --> 23:52.464
WON'T ALWAYS BE EASY, BUT IT

23:52.464 --> 23:53.799
WILL BE FOREVER.

23:53.799 --> 23:54.432
"FOREVER.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.233
FOR REAL."

23:55.233 --> 23:56.101
NOW RELATIONSHIPS COME WITH

23:56.101 --> 23:58.637
INSTRUCTIONS.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.404
WOW.

23:59.404 --> 23:59.971
FIRST, THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN

23:59.971 --> 24:02.707
THAT COUPLE IS VERY MUCH ON THE

24:02.707 --> 24:03.241
CHARTS.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.042
AND IT DOESN'T HELP THAT THEY

24:04.042 --> 24:04.943
TRIED TO SET THE MOOD BY

24:04.943 --> 24:06.478
LIGHTING CANDLES WHEN THE REST

24:06.478 --> 24:07.379
OF THE ROOM IS LIT LIKE THE

24:07.379 --> 24:14.386
FREEZER AISLE AT A KROGER.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.020
ONE REPORTER WHO ATTENDED ONE OF

24:15.020 --> 24:15.821
THOSE CLASSES FOUND PARTICIPANTS

24:15.821 --> 24:16.922
WERE SHOCKED TO LEARN THEY'D

24:16.922 --> 24:17.489
BEEN PAID FOR WITH WELFARE

24:17.489 --> 24:18.590
DOLLARS, BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED

24:18.590 --> 24:19.758
THEMSELVES, "PRETTY GOOD" AND

24:19.758 --> 24:20.892
"FINANCIALLY STABLE."

24:20.892 --> 24:23.395
BUT BECAUSE, REMEMBER,

24:23.395 --> 24:24.062
SUPPORTING A TWO-PARENT

24:24.062 --> 24:25.263
HOUSEHOLD IS ONE OF THE FOUR

24:25.263 --> 24:26.331
PURPOSES TANF FUNDS CAN BE USED

24:26.331 --> 24:26.998
FOR, WHAT OKLAHOMA DID IS

24:26.998 --> 24:28.366
COMPLETELY LEGAL.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.268
AND WHILE THEY EVENTUALLY ENDED

24:30.268 --> 24:31.536
THAT PROGRAM IN 2016, THAT WAS

24:31.536 --> 24:33.605
ONLY AFTER 17 YEARS OF SPENDING

24:33.605 --> 24:35.273
TANF DOLLARS ON IT.

24:35.273 --> 24:36.975
AND AT ITS ABSOLUTE WORST, TANF

24:36.975 --> 24:38.710
MONEY CAN BE USED IN ACTIVELY

24:38.710 --> 24:40.212
HARMFUL WAYS, LIKE FUNDING

24:40.212 --> 24:41.980
CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.682
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM BEFORE

24:43.682 --> 24:44.015
ON THIS SHOW.

24:44.015 --> 24:45.450
THEY'RE BASICALLY FAKE ABORTION

24:45.450 --> 24:46.551
CLINICS DESIGNED TO PERSUADE

24:46.551 --> 24:48.520
PEOPLE TO SEE PREGNANCIES

24:48.520 --> 24:49.554
THROUGH TO TERM, OFTEN BY

24:49.554 --> 24:51.323
PROPAGATING MISINFORMATION.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.891
AND YET, AT LEAST 10 STATES HAVE

24:52.891 --> 24:54.960
SIPHONED MILLIONS OF TANF

24:54.960 --> 24:56.261
DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THEM.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.462
UP UNTIL LAST YEAR, TEXAS HAD

24:57.462 --> 24:59.898
DIRECTED $45 MILLION IN TANF

24:59.898 --> 25:01.766
FUNDS TO THESE CLINICS.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.101
AND JUST LISTEN TO SOME OF THE

25:03.101 --> 25:03.702
MISINFORMATION ONE OF THEM WAS

25:03.702 --> 25:05.203
TELLING PEOPLE.

25:05.203 --> 25:06.938
AT A CENTER IN THE DALLAS

25:06.938 --> 25:08.006
AREA, A VOLUNTEER TOLD OUR

25:08.006 --> 25:09.641
PRODUCER THEY DON'T OFFER

25:09.641 --> 25:11.142
ABORTIONS, ADDING, "ABORTIONS

25:11.142 --> 25:13.812
CAN CAUSE INFERTILITY."

25:13.812 --> 25:14.512
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ABORTION

25:14.512 --> 25:17.649
PILL, THE VOLUNTEER SAID, "MY

25:17.649 --> 25:19.417
JOB IS NOT TO SCARE YOU.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.151
YOU NEVER GET OVER SEEING THAT

25:20.151 --> 25:22.053
BABY."

25:22.053 --> 25:24.122
SHE THEN POINTED TO A SMALL

25:24.122 --> 25:25.824
PLASTIC MODEL LIKE THIS SAYING,

25:25.824 --> 25:27.392
"CAN YOU IMAGINE ONE OF THESE IN

25:27.392 --> 25:29.427
YOUR PANTIES?"

25:29.427 --> 25:31.096
HOLY SHIT!

25:31.096 --> 25:32.530
YOUR TAX DOLLARS, WHICH WERE

25:32.530 --> 25:34.532
MEANT TO HELP POOR FAMILIES,

25:34.532 --> 25:36.167
INSTEAD WENT TO SOMEONE UTTERING

25:36.167 --> 25:37.702
THE SINGLE GROSSEST SENTENCE IN

25:37.702 --> 25:39.504
THE HISTORY OF WORDS, THE ONLY

25:39.504 --> 25:41.172
PROPER RESPONSE TO WHICH IS,

25:41.172 --> 25:42.474
"CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH OF A

25:42.474 --> 25:44.509
WEIRDO YOU'D HAVE TO BE TO SAY

25:44.509 --> 25:45.543
THE WORD PANTIES TO A STRANGER

25:45.543 --> 25:46.845
WHILE SHOWING THEM YOUR

25:46.845 --> 25:47.779
COLLECTION OF RUSSIAN NESTING

25:47.779 --> 25:50.282
FETUSES?"

25:50.282 --> 25:51.283
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING STATES

25:51.283 --> 25:52.584
DON'T GIVE ANY TANF FUNDS TO

25:52.584 --> 25:53.518
NEEDY FAMILIES.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.653
BUT IN MANY CASES, THEY SEEM

25:54.653 --> 25:56.087
PRETTY FAR DOWN THE LIST OF

25:56.087 --> 25:57.622
PRIORITIES.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.958
IN OKLAHOMA, SITE OF THOSE

25:59.958 --> 26:01.092
STERILE MARRIAGE CLASSES, THE

26:01.092 --> 26:02.961
STATE WAS SPENDING JUST 9% OF

26:02.961 --> 26:03.795
ITS TANF BLOCK GRANT ON CASH

26:03.795 --> 26:06.131
ASSISTANCE.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.265
AND ONE WAY STATES MANAGE TO

26:07.265 --> 26:09.401
KEEP THEIR TANF ROLLS INCREDIBLY

26:09.401 --> 26:11.002
LEAN IS TO SET THE BARRIER TO

26:11.002 --> 26:12.971
ACCESS THEM INSURMOUNTABLY HIGH.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.906
IN MORE THAN 25 STATES, A FAMILY

26:14.906 --> 26:16.274
OF THREE LIVING AT HALF THE

26:16.274 --> 26:18.843
FEDERAL POVERTY LINE EARNS TOO

26:18.843 --> 26:21.313
MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR TANF.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.981
WHICH IS ABSURD.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.316
JUST LISTEN TO THESE WOMEN IN

26:24.316 --> 26:25.684
MISSISSIPPI, WHO WERE TOLD THEY

26:25.684 --> 26:27.519
WERE TOO RICH TO QUALIFY.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.754
WE ARE THE PEOPLE.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.122
WE ARE WHO THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

26:31.122 --> 26:32.223
SUPPOSED TO HELP.

26:32.223 --> 26:34.192
AND THEY'RE NOT HELPING US.

26:34.192 --> 26:35.327
WHEN YOU WERE REJECTED FOR

26:35.327 --> 26:37.429
TANF FOR MAKING TOO MUCH MONEY,

26:37.429 --> 26:39.064
HOW MUCH WERE YOU MAKING?"

26:39.064 --> 26:40.031
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY

26:40.031 --> 26:41.433
MORE THAN $11 AN HOUR.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.668
I WAS ACTUALLY MAKING $9 AND

26:43.668 --> 26:45.603
I WAS DENIED-- HOW DO I MAKE

26:45.603 --> 26:47.706
TOO MUCH MONEY WITH THREE KIDS,

26:47.706 --> 26:51.409
RENT, UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION,

26:51.409 --> 26:51.977
LIKE, HOW DO I MAKE TOO MUCH

26:51.977 --> 26:52.978
MONEY?

26:52.978 --> 26:54.179
YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT

26:54.179 --> 26:56.815
QUESTION.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.249
BECAUSE IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT A

26:58.249 --> 26:59.684
PARENT OF THREE STRUGGLING TO

26:59.684 --> 27:01.252
MAKE ENDS MEET HAS "TOO MUCH

27:01.252 --> 27:03.355
MONEY" TO RECEIVE TANF

27:03.355 --> 27:04.456
ASSISTANCE, WHILE THE STATE WAS

27:04.456 --> 27:04.990
MORE THAN HAPPY TO

27:04.990 --> 27:07.659
SHOVEL CASH TOWARD BOTH BRETT

27:07.659 --> 27:08.360
FAVRE AND TED DIBIASE, A

27:08.360 --> 27:09.494
WRESTLER WHOSE SIGNATURE POSE IS

27:09.494 --> 27:10.462
"HEY, EVERYONE!

27:10.462 --> 27:12.664
I JUST ROBBED AN ATM."

27:12.664 --> 27:14.065
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE

27:14.065 --> 27:14.666
INCOME THRESHOLD CAN BE

27:14.666 --> 27:15.567
PROHIBITIVELY LOW.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.334
IT'S THAT THE APPLICATION

27:16.334 --> 27:17.535
PROCESS ITSELF CAN BE DEEPLY

27:17.535 --> 27:18.870
INVASIVE.

27:18.870 --> 27:19.871
FOR INSTANCE, STATES ARE

27:19.871 --> 27:21.306
REQUIRED TO OFFSET ANY TANF

27:21.306 --> 27:22.440
MONEY THEY GIVE TO SINGLE

27:22.440 --> 27:23.775
MOTHERS BY CHASING DOWN THE

27:23.775 --> 27:25.076
BIOLOGICAL FATHERS FOR CHILD

27:25.076 --> 27:27.312
SUPPORT.

27:27.312 --> 27:27.946
MONEY THE GOVERNMENT THEN OFTEN

27:27.946 --> 27:29.681
KEEPS FOR ITSELF.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.483
SO IN SOME STATES, SINGLE

27:31.483 --> 27:32.917
MOTHERS APPLYING FOR PUBLIC

27:32.917 --> 27:34.052
ASSISTANCE ARE FORCED TO

27:34.052 --> 27:35.453
IDENTIFY THE FATHER OF THEIR

27:35.453 --> 27:37.155
CHILD, HIS EYE COLOR, HIS

27:37.155 --> 27:37.989
LICENSE PLATE NUMBER, AND THE

27:37.989 --> 27:39.791
EXACT DATE WHEN THEY GOT

27:39.791 --> 27:40.759
PREGNANT, OFTEN UNDER PENALTY OF

27:40.759 --> 27:42.227
PERJURY.

27:42.227 --> 27:43.395
WHICH IS THE MOST HUMILIATING

27:43.395 --> 27:44.763
WAY TO IDENTIFY THE FATHER OF

27:44.763 --> 27:46.765
YOUR CHILD THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE

27:46.765 --> 27:48.433
MAURY FUCKING POVICH.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.402
BUT THERE'S ONE MORE TWIST HERE.

27:50.402 --> 27:51.803
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU QUALIFY AND

27:51.803 --> 27:53.238
ARE ABLE TO GET ASSISTANCE, IT

27:53.238 --> 27:53.838
CAN BE EXTREMELY EASY TO THEN

27:53.838 --> 27:55.306
LOSE IT.

27:55.306 --> 27:56.775
NOT ONLY DO SOME STATES SET TIME

27:56.775 --> 27:58.143
LIMITS FOR HOW LONG YOU CAN GET

27:58.143 --> 27:59.544
TANF, ARIZONA KICKS YOU OFF

27:59.544 --> 28:01.312
AFTER JUST A YEAR.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.680
THE MONEY COMES WITH AN

28:02.680 --> 28:03.448
OBLIGATION TO PERFORM "WORK

28:03.448 --> 28:05.483
ACTIVITIES", LIKE JOB SEARCHING

28:05.483 --> 28:06.851
AND TRAINING, THAT RECIPIENTS

28:06.851 --> 28:09.320
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN FOR A CERTAIN

28:09.320 --> 28:10.789
NUMBER OF HOURS EACH WEEK.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.223
BUT FOR STRUGGLING PARENTS--

28:12.223 --> 28:13.925
WHICH THIS PROGRAM IS FOR--

28:13.925 --> 28:15.093
REMEMBER, THAT CAN BE VERY

28:15.093 --> 28:16.594
DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY IF THEY

28:16.594 --> 28:18.863
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CHILDCARE.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.000
I'VE LOST THE CASH ASSISTANCE

28:22.000 --> 28:24.335
THREE OR FOUR TIMES DUE TO THE

28:24.335 --> 28:25.870
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, NO

28:25.870 --> 28:30.575
TRANSPORTATION, NOBODY TO WATCH

28:30.575 --> 28:31.843
MY SON, THEY-- THEY WANT YOU TO

28:31.843 --> 28:32.343
GO LOOKING FOR WORK.

28:32.343 --> 28:33.111
HOW DO YOU TAKE A KID INTO A JOB

28:33.111 --> 28:33.978
AND ASK FOR AN APPLICATION?

28:33.978 --> 28:35.680
RIGHT, IT'S NOT EASY TO

28:35.680 --> 28:36.281
TAKE YOUR KID ALONG INTO A JOB

28:36.281 --> 28:37.916
INTERVIEW.

28:37.916 --> 28:38.950
THAT'S WHY MOST JOB APPLICATIONS

28:38.950 --> 28:41.186
DON'T COME WITH A BONUS BIG MAZE

28:41.186 --> 28:45.323
AND A CRAYON.

28:45.323 --> 28:45.723
AND IT'S NOT LIKE

28:45.723 --> 28:46.658
HER STATE WELFARE OFFICE IS

28:46.658 --> 28:47.258
UNAWARE THAT SHE HAS A CHILD.

28:47.258 --> 28:47.625
THEY KNOW THAT.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.827
THEY MAY EVEN KNOW THE EXACT

28:48.827 --> 28:49.928
DATE HE WAS CONCEIVED FOR SOME

28:49.928 --> 28:50.929
FUCKING REASON.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.597
AND IF YOU FAIL TO MEET YOUR

28:52.597 --> 28:54.332
OBLIGATIONS, STATES CAN BE

28:54.332 --> 28:54.933
PRETTY UNFORGIVING IN CUTTING

28:54.933 --> 28:55.800
YOU OFF.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.235
JUST LISTEN TO ONE WOMAN WHO WAS

28:57.235 --> 28:58.169
KICKED OFF ASSISTANCE, DESPITE

28:58.169 --> 28:59.270
HAVING AN OBJECTIVELY SOLID

28:59.270 --> 29:01.206
EXCUSE.

29:01.206 --> 29:02.207
KIMBERLY THOMPSON SPENT TWO

29:02.207 --> 29:03.508
AND A HALF MONTHS IN THE

29:03.508 --> 29:05.043
HOSPITAL LAST SUMMER, AFTER AN

29:05.043 --> 29:06.744
INFECTION RAVAGED HER BODY.

29:06.744 --> 29:07.979
NEARLY HALF OF THAT TIME, SHE

29:07.979 --> 29:09.114
WAS IN A COMA.

29:09.114 --> 29:10.548
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, THOUGH,

29:10.548 --> 29:12.417
WHILE SHE WAS COMATOSE, THE

29:12.417 --> 29:14.552
COUNTY KICKED HER OFF GOVERNMENT

29:14.552 --> 29:15.019
ASSISTANCE.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.087
WELL I WAS IN A COMA AND I

29:16.087 --> 29:18.256
DIDN'T REPORT IN, AND I WAS

29:18.256 --> 29:19.491
SUPPOSED TO REPORT IN ONCE A

29:19.491 --> 29:21.292
WEEK-- SO, SINCE I DIDN'T

29:21.292 --> 29:22.927
REPORT IN, THEY JUST CUT IT ALL

29:22.927 --> 29:24.629
OFF.

29:24.629 --> 29:25.663
WOW, FINDING OUT YOU'VE

29:25.663 --> 29:27.432
LOST YOUR GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE

29:27.432 --> 29:29.234
HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST

29:29.234 --> 29:30.568
THINGS YOU COULD POSSIBLY HEAR

29:30.568 --> 29:32.003
WHEN WAKING UP FROM A COMA ALONG

29:32.003 --> 29:33.571
WITH "ACTUALLY, WE CALL HIM

29:33.571 --> 29:35.807
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW," AND "MOST

29:35.807 --> 29:37.876
OF THE DOGS YOU KNEW ARE DEAD."

29:37.876 --> 29:40.278
AND THE THING IS, ALL OF THIS--

29:40.278 --> 29:40.912
THE MULTIPLE HOOPS YOU HAVE TO

29:40.912 --> 29:42.080
JUMP THROUGH BEFORE GETTING

29:42.080 --> 29:43.548
ASSISTANCE, AND THE REQUIREMENTS

29:43.548 --> 29:44.983
YOU HAVE TO MEET TO KEEP IT--

29:44.983 --> 29:46.351
IS FOR AN ABYSMALLY SMALL AMOUNT

29:46.351 --> 29:46.885
OF MONEY.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.486
IN 15 STATES, CASH BENEFIT

29:48.486 --> 29:51.356
LEVELS DON'T EVEN REACH 20% OF

29:51.356 --> 29:53.324
THE POVERTY LINE, WHICH IS ABOUT

29:53.324 --> 29:55.226
$386 FOR A FAMILY OF THREE PER

29:55.226 --> 29:56.594
MONTH.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.662
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

29:57.662 --> 29:58.963
MAYBE STATES JUST DON'T HAVE THE

29:58.963 --> 30:00.198
MONEY," NOT ONLY HAVE YOU SEEN

30:00.198 --> 30:02.433
THE BULLSHIT SOME OF THEM SPEND

30:02.433 --> 30:03.501
IT ON INSTEAD, BUT YOU SHOULD

30:03.501 --> 30:04.669
KNOW.

30:04.669 --> 30:05.970
PERHAPS THE MOST SHOCKING THING

30:05.970 --> 30:07.539
SOME STATES SPEND TANF MONEY ON

30:07.539 --> 30:09.507
IS "ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL."

30:09.507 --> 30:10.575
AS OF LAST YEAR, STATES WERE

30:10.575 --> 30:12.510
SITTING ON $5.2 BILLION DOLLARS

30:12.510 --> 30:14.479
IN UNSPENT TANF FUNDS.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.847
TENNESSEE ALONE WAS HOARDING

30:15.847 --> 30:17.749
$790 MILLION, THE LARGEST POOL

30:17.749 --> 30:19.617
OF UNSPENT WELFARE FUNDS IN THE

30:19.617 --> 30:24.689
COUNTRY.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.524
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE FAMOUS SAYING

30:26.524 --> 30:27.492
GOES, "EVERYTHING'S BIGGER IN

30:27.492 --> 30:28.459
TENNESSEE, NO WAIT, FUCK, THAT'S

30:28.459 --> 30:28.660
TEXAS.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.260
OH NO, WHY IS SOMEONE WRITING

30:29.260 --> 30:30.195
DOWN EVERYTHING I'M SAYING?

30:30.195 --> 30:30.795
SCRATCH THAT FROM THE RECORD I

30:30.795 --> 30:31.563
SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.197
WHY ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

30:32.197 --> 30:32.830
STOP.

30:32.830 --> 30:33.598
I'M SERIOUS.

30:33.598 --> 30:34.499
STOP.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.500
IF YOU DON'T STOP WRITING I'LL

30:35.500 --> 30:36.801
FUCK YOU UP SO SILLY YOU'LL BE

30:36.801 --> 30:37.402
HOLDING PENS IN YOUR MOUTH,

30:37.402 --> 30:38.870
BITCH!"

30:38.870 --> 30:41.439
RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

30:41.439 --> 30:42.607
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS

30:42.607 --> 30:43.908
TOGETHER, IT'S NO WONDER THAT

30:43.908 --> 30:46.878
MOST PEOPLE ON TANF DON'T, IN

30:46.878 --> 30:48.379
FACT, GO FROM WELFARE TO WORK.

30:48.379 --> 30:49.981
IN 2018, ONLY 1 IN 4 TANF CASES

30:49.981 --> 30:52.283
CLOSED BECAUSE CLIENTS FOUND

30:52.283 --> 30:53.751
JOBS.

30:53.751 --> 30:54.786
BY AND LARGE, THE REST WERE

30:54.786 --> 30:56.621
KICKED OFF FOR ONE OF THE MANY

30:56.621 --> 31:02.760
BULLSHIT REASONS WE'VE

31:02.760 --> 31:03.394
MENTIONED TONIGHT.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.028
BASICALLY, TANF LIFTS PEOPLE OUT

31:04.028 --> 31:04.929
OF POVERTY THE SAME WAY ONE OF

31:04.929 --> 31:06.297
THOSE ARCADE CLAW GAMES LIFTS

31:06.297 --> 31:07.265
STUFFED ANIMALS OUT OF THE

31:07.265 --> 31:08.199
MACHINE, WHICH IS TO SAY, IT

31:08.199 --> 31:09.334
USUALLY JUST DROPS THEM RIGHT

31:09.334 --> 31:10.602
BACK WHERE THEY STARTED, AND IN

31:10.602 --> 31:15.006
MANY WAYS, THE WHOLE PROCESS IS

31:15.006 --> 31:15.573
A GIANT "FUCK YOU" TO KIDS.

31:15.573 --> 31:16.207
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE ARE

31:16.207 --> 31:17.308
THINGS WE COULD DO HERE, IF WE

31:17.308 --> 31:18.876
WANTED TO.

31:18.876 --> 31:19.544
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT SOME

31:19.544 --> 31:20.979
OF THE BIG, BROADER CHANGES THAT

31:20.979 --> 31:22.180
WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE THE PAIN OF

31:22.180 --> 31:22.814
POVERTY.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.382
BUT EVEN WHEN IT JUST COMES TO

31:24.382 --> 31:26.417
TANF, THERE ARE OPTIONS.

31:26.417 --> 31:27.719
WE COULD SET A MINIMUM BENEFIT

31:27.719 --> 31:29.053
LEVEL, AND LOOSEN SOME OF THE

31:29.053 --> 31:30.321
REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT SO

31:30.321 --> 31:31.623
EASY TO LOSE ASSISTANCE.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.091
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING

31:33.091 --> 31:34.692
BLOCK GRANTS-- WHICH I WOULD

31:34.692 --> 31:35.460
ARGUE WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULDN'T--

31:35.460 --> 31:36.728
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST BE ADJUSTED

31:36.728 --> 31:38.863
FOR INFLATION AND POPULATION

31:38.863 --> 31:39.964
GROWTH, WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT

31:39.964 --> 31:41.165
REQUIRED TO BE SPENT ON DIRECT

31:41.165 --> 31:42.267
CASH ASSISTANCE.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.702
LOOK, THE WILD THING IS, OUR

31:44.702 --> 31:46.004
CURRENT SYSTEM WAS CREATED UNDER

31:46.004 --> 31:47.405
THE ASSUMPTION THAT POOR

31:47.405 --> 31:48.640
FAMILIES SIMPLY COULDN'T BE

31:48.640 --> 31:49.941
TRUSTED TO COLLECT WELFARE

31:49.941 --> 31:51.342
HONESTLY.

31:51.342 --> 31:55.680
BUT THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES

31:55.680 --> 31:56.314
HAVE PROVEN THAT'S IT'S ACTUALLY

31:56.314 --> 31:57.348
POLITICIANS AND GOVERNMENT

31:57.348 --> 31:57.849
OFFICIALS WHO'VE BEEN

31:57.849 --> 31:59.250
RELENTLESSLY ABUSING THE SYSTEM.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.251
TO BORROW A PHRASE, WE'VE BEEN

32:00.251 --> 32:01.052
FEEDING THE ALLIGATORS IN STATE

32:01.052 --> 32:02.620
GOVERNMENT, AND THAT HAS BRED

32:02.620 --> 32:04.489
DEPENDENCY.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.224
SO WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTALLY

32:06.224 --> 32:07.959
REWORK THINGS, SO THIS MONEY AND

32:07.959 --> 32:10.228
IDEALLY MUCH MORE CAN GO WHERE

32:10.228 --> 32:10.728
IT'S BADLY NEEDED.

32:10.728 --> 32:13.531
AND IF ANY LAWMAKERS THINK THAT

32:13.531 --> 32:14.932
SOUNDS TOO HARD, AND ARE TEMPTED

32:14.932 --> 32:16.067
TO TAKE A PASS ON THAT, I HAVE A

32:16.067 --> 32:17.735
SONG WITH A POWERFUL MESSAGE

32:17.735 --> 32:19.103
THAT I'M PRETTY SURE WILL

32:19.103 --> 32:21.572
INSPIRE YOU.

32:21.572 --> 32:24.175
♪ WORK FOR IT, WORK FOR IT ♪ ♪

32:24.175 --> 32:24.642
TURN YOUR DREAMS INTO

32:24.642 --> 32:24.909
REALITY ♪

32:24.909 --> 32:28.846
♪ WORK FOR IT, WORK FOR IT ♪

32:28.846 --> 32:29.213
EXACTLY.

32:29.213 --> 32:30.281
AND NOW THIS.

32:30.281 --> 32:37.188
AND NOW,

32:37.188 --> 32:38.523
THE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS OF

32:38.523 --> 32:38.823
RACHAEL RAY.

32:38.823 --> 32:39.424
WHEN I WAS A GIRL, I WAS A

32:39.424 --> 32:40.191
FOUNTAIN GIRL AT HOWARD

32:40.191 --> 32:41.693
JOHNSON'S.

32:41.693 --> 32:42.527
BACK IN THE DAY I WAS A HOTEL

32:42.527 --> 32:44.195
FOUNTAIN GIRL.

32:44.195 --> 32:44.829
I WAS A FOUNTAIN GIRL AT HOWARD

32:44.829 --> 32:45.963
JOHNSON'S.

32:45.963 --> 32:49.801
WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO WORK

32:49.801 --> 32:50.401
AT HOJO'S, HOWARD JOHNSON'S.

32:50.401 --> 32:54.906
OH, MY GOD, I FEEL LIKE I WAS

32:54.906 --> 32:55.573
WORKING IN HOJO'S BACK IN THE

32:55.573 --> 32:56.841
DAY.

32:56.841 --> 32:59.677
LIKE A BIG OLD ICE CREAM SCOOP.

32:59.677 --> 33:02.380
WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO WORK

33:02.380 --> 33:02.980
AT HOJO'S.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.550
WHEN I WAS PROMOTED TO THE

33:05.550 --> 33:09.053
FOUNTAIN, I THOUGHT MY LIFE

33:09.053 --> 33:09.954
WOULD BE AMAZING.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.289
IT WAS LIKE CINDERELLA, IT WAS

33:11.289 --> 33:13.057
SO EXCITING.

33:13.057 --> 33:14.625
AND THEN I REALIZED I WAS TOO

33:14.625 --> 33:17.795
SHORT TO SCOOP THE ICE CREAM.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.397
AND THERE WAS A LITTLE FAUCET

33:19.397 --> 33:25.336
THAT WOULD CLEAN THE SCOOPS SO

33:25.336 --> 33:26.571
IT WAS A CONSTANT STREAM OF

33:26.571 --> 33:28.473
LEFTOVER ICE CREAM ON THE SIDE

33:28.473 --> 33:29.941
OF THE ICE CREAM IN COLOR.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.376
SO WHEN I PUSHED MYSELF AND

33:31.376 --> 33:32.977
THROW MYSELF INTO THE ICE CREAM

33:32.977 --> 33:35.313
COOLER TO GET THE ICE CREAM, I

33:35.313 --> 33:38.349
ENDED UP WITH A LINE OF MELTED

33:38.349 --> 33:43.087
SOUR EVERY FLAVOR HOWARD

33:43.087 --> 33:43.955
JOHNSON'S SERVED ICE CREAM

33:43.955 --> 33:44.922
ACROSS MY BOOTS.

33:44.922 --> 33:46.824
SO I BECAME THE GIRL WITH THE

33:46.824 --> 33:47.792
ICE CREAM BOOTS.

33:52.797 --> 33:56.167
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

33:56.167 --> 33:56.634
THANKS SO MUCH FOR

33:56.634 --> 33:57.502
WATCHING.

33:57.502 --> 33:58.236
