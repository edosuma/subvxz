WEBVTT

00:08.625 --> 00:12.041
I know you love that. So, we're going to start with words that

00:08.625 --> 00:12.041
end in "an."

00:12.083 --> 00:15.250
You yell out a word, I'll write it down, let's see how many

00:12.083 --> 00:15.250
we can get. Go!

00:15.291 --> 00:17.417
-Fan! -Fan! There's a good one.

00:17.458 --> 00:19.834
-Man! -Man, that's another one.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.750
-Lesbian!

00:21.792 --> 00:25.041
Words ending in "an."

00:25.083 --> 00:28.834
-Lesbian! -I think I heard "pan." Good.

00:28.875 --> 00:32.250
-No, Faith said "lesbian!"

00:32.291 --> 00:34.625
-Alright, no big deal. Faith said "lesbian".

00:34.667 --> 00:36.792
Hold on. Good. We'll write that down.

00:36.834 --> 00:40.083
Just a word, not a big deal but we'll move on. We'll get

00:36.834 --> 00:40.083
some other ones.

00:40.125 --> 00:44.083
-Well, it's your word...

00:40.125 --> 00:44.083
How do you...?

00:44.125 --> 00:47.041
Alright, if you liked another girl...

00:49.125 --> 00:51.583
-Well, if you like, like Olivia, you could be, sure.

00:51.625 --> 00:55.959
-I like, like, like Olivia. -I LOVE Olivia!

00:59.125 --> 01:01.709
-No, it doesn't work that way, Phillip.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.875
You can never be a lesbian.

01:03.917 --> 01:06.417
-No fair. I want to be a lesbian.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.792
-Me too! -You can all be lesbians.

01:08.834 --> 01:12.041
Okay? Let's just move on. Let's try words that end in "on."

01:14.125 --> 01:16.291
-Prostitution!

01:18.750 --> 01:21.667
Ah..Let's say...

01:21.709 --> 01:24.291
Prostitution is when you work in the street...

01:24.333 --> 01:28.083
And...You get paid. -I want to do prostitution!

01:28.125 --> 01:32.291
-No...Alright, moving on to words that end in "re"...

01:32.333 --> 01:36.083
But let me just have a second here to think if...

01:36.125 --> 01:38.000
Nothing, there can't be.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.667
So, shout out words that end in "re".

01:40.709 --> 01:43.792
: Crack whore!

01:46.542 --> 01:49.000
♪ I'm awesome, no you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:49.041 --> 01:51.625
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving around in my mom's ride ♪

01:51.667 --> 01:54.542
♪ I'm awesome, a quarter of my life gone by ♪

01:56.166 --> 01:58.875
♪ I'm awesome ♪

02:00.166 --> 02:03.000
-Every time I go to this grocery store, something goes wrong!

02:03.041 --> 02:06.458
This time I get home, I have tuna in my bag!

02:06.500 --> 02:10.000
I don't eat tuna. So, she took someone else's groceries.

02:10.041 --> 02:12.333
Did I pay for this tuna?

02:12.375 --> 02:15.959
Couldn't you just bag my groceries properly for...

02:16.000 --> 02:19.333
: Mmm, take your time. Hot stuff.

02:19.375 --> 02:22.083
You're late and you interrupted a great story.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.291
-Your stories are always boring, bro.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.375
Is detention.

02:26.417 --> 02:28.542
Which you will be at after school.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.709
You're not busy, and you'll be there after school.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.959
That's how that works, okay

02:36.000 --> 02:38.125
-Yes Alistair.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.083
I forget what I was... I was telling a story.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.083
Now I forget it, 'cause of Christian.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.250
-Guys, let's spread out and let's move!

02:47.291 --> 02:50.333
This is physical education! Phys Ed, not stand around!

02:50.375 --> 02:53.583
Your hands are in your pockets. What is going on?

02:53.625 --> 02:56.959
Lori, come on! Get up! -I'm so tired!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.125
: I can't play anymore.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.041
-Yeah, no I totally get it.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.709
It's just that we just started and you haven't moved yet.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.125
So, I don't understand why you're so tired.

03:06.166 --> 03:09.417
-No, I'm not lazy shaming you.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.625
: But if you and everyone else here,

03:11.667 --> 03:13.834
If you don't start getting active, yeah I'm looking at you!

03:13.875 --> 03:16.000
I'm gonna start taking away marks, how about that?

03:16.041 --> 03:18.166
-Being active isn't the same for everyone, miss.

03:18.208 --> 03:21.291
That's fine, it's just I need you to have your heart rate

03:18.208 --> 03:21.291
going up, okay?

03:21.333 --> 03:24.083
I mean, let's go! Do your best, please.

03:24.125 --> 03:27.083
-Then your best sucks.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.125
Hey, am I right? I'm so right.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.208
Hey, we're not taking a break, let's get going!

03:32.250 --> 03:37.709
-Okay everybody, today we are going to be talking about

03:32.250 --> 03:37.709
Niccolo...

03:37.750 --> 03:41.291
Okay everybody! There's a lot to get through, so...

03:41.333 --> 03:43.792
Hey! Hey!  You guys!

03:45.166 --> 03:48.041
If you could just help me out... Just this one time.

03:48.083 --> 03:51.125
: 'Cause I'm having a really rough week.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.625
: It's just a lot.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.792
Going through this, like, really weird thing with my godparents.

03:57.834 --> 04:00.709
: And I just feel...

04:00.750 --> 04:04.208
: A little bit overwhelmed.

04:15.166 --> 04:18.166
: Of course.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.709
I am fine. I should not...

04:20.750 --> 04:23.125
Everybody I should not have broken down like that.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.583
So, I apologize.

04:25.625 --> 04:28.542
-No, no really. But, thank you.

04:28.583 --> 04:32.333
But listen, now that I have you back...

04:32.375 --> 04:36.041
Why don't we take a minute to talk a little bit...

04:36.083 --> 04:39.875
About Niccolo Machiavelli.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.458
: Okay.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.500
: Everybody's lookin' at me.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.291
-Blow, winds crack your cheeks.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.458
You cataracts and hurricanes.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.875
: Rage! -I am raging.

04:53.917 --> 04:56.959
-No, you dilettante. How many times do we have to go over

04:53.917 --> 04:56.959
this?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.500
The line is "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.917
Rage! Blow!" And then "cataracts..."

05:03.959 --> 05:06.083
Yadda, yadda. And so on.

05:08.166 --> 05:11.583
-Detention. -Oh you can't punish him

05:08.166 --> 05:11.583
for being talentless, Gerry.

05:11.625 --> 05:14.500
That's what the critics are for. -Very funny.

05:14.542 --> 05:17.041
Let's go. -Sorry, sir. Occupado.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.917
I don't know what you just said, but you don't

05:17.083 --> 05:20.917
speak like that to a teacher.

05:20.959 --> 05:25.417
I'm fed up! I'm fed up having to chase you around the school,

05:20.959 --> 05:25.417
To tell you to go to detention.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.750
-Mama likes what she's hearing. -We'll do this later.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.291
-We'll do this later. We'll do this later.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.917
We'll do this now! NOW!

05:33.959 --> 05:37.333
'Cause I am the teacher! YOU are the student!

05:37.375 --> 05:40.500
Now get your ass down to detention...

05:40.542 --> 05:43.041
RIGHT THIS SECOND!

05:43.083 --> 05:45.291
You don't tell me, anything.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.875
I tell you! -Tell me, Gerry.

05:47.917 --> 05:50.166
: Tell me how you feel about this boy.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.667
You're old. -So are you.

05:54.709 --> 05:57.583
-You're useless. No one respects your authority.

05:57.625 --> 06:01.458
And it's making you lose your mind! Isn't it?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.709
-I'm not useless at all, I do a lot.

06:03.750 --> 06:07.792
-Denial, it's perfect! You wreak of Lear!

06:07.834 --> 06:11.208
I've found my muse! You, get out of here, you're through.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.458
-Go on, get out. You stink!

06:13.500 --> 06:16.709
Go on, pack your bags! -That means go to detention.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.125
-There's a new king in town.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.291
What are you? -You, Gerry.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.125
-I have no idea what's happening right now.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.375
-You are my new...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.125
Lear!

06:41.834 --> 06:44.250
: Okay. Let's do this!

06:44.291 --> 06:46.959
Come on. Okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Child labour? Um, the seal hunt.

06:50.041 --> 06:53.500
Human trafficking, that's bad but like not really bad...

06:53.542 --> 06:56.542
For me, personally. Ummm....

06:56.583 --> 07:01.125
: Beaches... She dies...At the end.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.834
: Beaches... Why does she die?

07:07.709 --> 07:11.375
: Okay. Showtime.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.625
Are you okay? -[Nisha sobs/

07:16.917 --> 07:19.625
Students stop chattering]

07:19.667 --> 07:22.750
I didn't even notice.

07:22.792 --> 07:25.625
That's so embarrassing.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.834
Bless your heart, it's nothing...It's just...

07:28.875 --> 07:31.834
: It would mean a lot to me...

07:31.875 --> 07:36.125
If we could just get through the lesson today, okay?

07:36.166 --> 07:40.542
Because I am going through a very difficult time.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.041
-Of course.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.041
-Alright ya lazy farts!

07:48.083 --> 07:51.333
Some of you have said that you're doing your best and

07:48.083 --> 07:51.333
I say, I don't think so.

07:51.375 --> 07:54.208
So, we're all going to wear heart monitors to find out who's

07:54.250 --> 07:57.500
telling the truth and who's lying about doing their best.

07:57.542 --> 08:01.000
-Yeah, that's right, it's a

07:57.542 --> 08:01.000
bit of a game changer.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.166
: Strap these on and pass them around.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.792
Now some of you might notice that Lori's been doing laps this

08:03.208 --> 08:06.792
whole time...

08:06.834 --> 08:09.000
She's my little guinea pig.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.208
: I told you, this is my best!

08:11.250 --> 08:14.417
-No one can hear you, chuckles. Hey, kids look up there to the

08:11.250 --> 08:14.417
chart, see that?

08:14.458 --> 08:16.333
That's Lori's heart rate, alright?

08:16.375 --> 08:19.500
She's doing 65 beats per minute.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.709
That's a great question. That means that Lori's a little liar.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.875
I'd like to see that at least a hundred and twenty beats

08:22.750 --> 08:25.875
per minute, alright?

08:25.917 --> 08:29.542
Everybody show me you've got one on. Let's see! Nice!

08:29.583 --> 08:31.542
-Yeah, go ahead. -Miss, I gotta go too.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.041
-Yeah, yeah go. Alright, come on. Less talkies, more walkies.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.041
Let's move it guys.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.125
-I'm loving the commitment, Gerry!

08:41.667 --> 08:44.041
: This doesn't look like it's...

08:46.792 --> 08:49.750
Isn't opening night tomorrow?

08:49.792 --> 08:53.000
-I'm not worried. He's a natural.

08:53.041 --> 08:56.375
: It's not real.

08:56.417 --> 09:00.125
That's so cool. I am King Lear!

09:00.166 --> 09:03.792
Whaaa! : It's not real.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.834
Why is that so cool? I thought those were real.

09:06.875 --> 09:10.083
So into the role of Lear, it's like he's actually demented.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.291
Me?

09:17.542 --> 09:20.709
And yet not so since, I am sure,

09:20.750 --> 09:23.125
my love's more richer than my tongue.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.917
I don't even know what she said there. She's

09:23.166 --> 09:26.917
not speaking English.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.166
-It's Shakespeare, Gerry. Just read what's on the page.

09:30.208 --> 09:32.417
: I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.542
Like, I think I'm gonna take a look at some of this and play

09:32.458 --> 09:35.542
around with the words a bit.

09:35.583 --> 09:39.333
-Okay, well Shakespeare is sort of a stickler for words, so if

09:35.583 --> 09:39.333
you could just...

09:39.375 --> 09:42.000
-I'll even make it funnier. We'll add some comedy.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.959
-He's changing the words of Shakespeare.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.083
-Well, it'll be more of a... adaptation.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.291
Look at him! -Now this...

09:49.333 --> 09:50.750
-He is Lear!

09:52.000 --> 09:55.041
: Go! It's you.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.000
-And yet not so;

09:57.041 --> 10:00.792
since, I am sure, my love's more richer than my tongue.

10:03.125 --> 10:06.500
-Your daughter's name is... Cordelia.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.542
Didn't see you at the mall last week.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.542
Right?

10:12.583 --> 10:18.041
-A good director has to trust her actors.

10:12.583 --> 10:18.041
-Make it relevant.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.959
-Great! Great, thanks! Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.291
-Everything is the best!

10:22.333 --> 10:25.083
Yes, thank you! -Let's cut to the chase,

10:22.333 --> 10:25.083
shall we?

10:25.125 --> 10:28.834
Are you breaking down in class: What?

10:28.875 --> 10:31.083
: Like...Hmmm? -Oh my goodness!

10:31.125 --> 10:34.959
: Mr. Cheeley! No. Oh, you are so sweet.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.583
No, I'm totally fine. It's just a trick.

10:37.625 --> 10:41.166
I realized that when you lose the kids you lose the room.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.041
The best way to get them back is by crying.

10:44.083 --> 10:47.041
And, it keeps working. So, I keep doing it.

10:47.083 --> 10:50.583
Just on command?

10:50.625 --> 10:54.291
-I have my sad stuff to get me where I'm going if I

10:50.625 --> 10:54.291
need to call on it.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.041
But, yeah, pretty much, yeah. -You don't say.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.208
: Yeah.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.834
-Well, you know, like Sarah McLaughlin.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.083
Or family specials at restaurants.

11:05.125 --> 11:07.291
Not everybody has a family. Or I think of...

11:07.333 --> 11:10.125
Somebody who has just one very small hand.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.083
-Okay. -My Uncle Tommy.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.000
He was a psychopath, class A. : Right.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.709
-Italian people... A public park.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.959
Anything to do with, like, Will Smith.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.166
You know, whatever I need. I just bring it up.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.583
And then , starts coming down.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.750
: Yeah. -Great...

11:27.792 --> 11:30.166
-And I know, I know that it's "wrong."

11:30.208 --> 11:33.166
Um, I'm not intimidating, like you.

11:33.208 --> 11:36.166
I wasn't born with that...You know, that you were born with.

11:36.208 --> 11:39.375
And, no offence but you have no idea

11:39.417 --> 11:43.166
what it's like when no one respects your authority.

11:43.208 --> 11:47.083
-No I don't...I don't know what that's like.

11:47.125 --> 11:50.166
It must be hard...

11:50.208 --> 11:52.083
-You imagine, right.

11:52.125 --> 11:57.500
-Which is why, as your superior I must put my professional foot

11:52.125 --> 11:57.500
down.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.667
And insist that you...

12:00.709 --> 12:05.125
Ma'am stop breaking down in your classroom.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.166
: Really: Yes, stop!

12:07.208 --> 12:09.542
Yes, stop crying in the classroom.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.667
-I'm sorry, it's just, I thought you were my friend and...

12:12.709 --> 12:15.083
Now you're yelling at me in your office.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.041
And that's just not what I thought was gonna happen.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.333
-Oh my gosh.

12:20.375 --> 12:24.208
Nisha I'm genuinely sorry.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.583
-Oh, thank you.

12:26.625 --> 12:30.041
: I didn't...Um... -See!

12:30.083 --> 12:33.000
: Yes!

12:33.041 --> 12:35.041
Right

12:38.375 --> 12:40.250
: Okay.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.750
Alright you guys, see what happens when you motivate

12:40.291 --> 12:43.750
yourselves?

12:43.792 --> 12:46.041
This is fantastic! And two of you...

12:46.083 --> 12:48.375
Hudson and Sophie went above and beyond.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.917
So, whatever you guys are doing, keep it up! Okay?

12:50.959 --> 12:53.041
Round of applause for Hudson and Sophie.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.750
They are now an example to everybody else.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.750
Eyes on them.

12:56.792 --> 13:01.625
Looks like those little monitors have motivated you guys to

12:56.792 --> 13:01.625
exercise.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.458
My job! Alright, go get changed.

13:10.709 --> 13:13.583
: Ready Gerry? -Actually I'm really nervous.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.583
There's a lot more people

13:13.625 --> 13:16.583
there than I thought.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.291
Not sure I thought this through. -That's okay. It's normal to

13:16.625 --> 13:19.291
be nervous.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.542
-Yeah, okay. -Look at me. I'm terrified.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.125
-Okay.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.959
-Don't you worry, you're a natural.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.041
Just use that nervous energy. Use it.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.041
-Okay.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.417
-Thanks.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.250
: I shall my liege.

13:41.500 --> 13:45.000
-Ah, for the love of God. -It's ridiculous.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.041
-I am King Lear!

13:47.875 --> 13:50.583
-Speak to many but

13:47.875 --> 13:50.583
listen only to me.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.959
: A horse, a horse.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.959
A kingdom for my horse.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.750
: Or something like

13:54.000 --> 13:56.750
that...

14:03.291 --> 14:05.959
-It's like he's not even human.

14:45.083 --> 14:49.000
: To see or not to see.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.000
: For you, you are a

15:05.542 --> 15:08.000
rose.

15:34.125 --> 15:37.041
-My king.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.917
-My king

15:43.875 --> 15:46.166
-Brava!

15:54.041 --> 15:58.166
-Hey Trudy. Um, tell me what you think of these, please. A little

15:54.041 --> 15:58.166
feedback.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.792
-I think they're probably going to be too thick for the

15:58.208 --> 16:01.792
shredder.

16:01.834 --> 16:05.250
But I bet they'd burn real good. -Come on Trudy, be serious.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.417
I need to pick one of these.

16:07.458 --> 16:10.000
The one that best captures my range as an actor.

16:10.041 --> 16:12.583
-No photo could ever capture what you're capable of.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.583
-Jealousy, I've heard about that in the biz. It's rampant.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.166
Ya can't get to me. -Actually, you weren't as bad as

16:16.625 --> 16:20.166
I thought you were gonna be.

16:22.375 --> 16:26.333
I thought that you were going to be soul crushingly horrible.

16:26.375 --> 16:30.667
But you were actually just... really, really bad.

16:30.709 --> 16:33.333
And I think you have better odds

16:33.375 --> 16:35.834
of giving birth to a litter of kittens...

16:35.875 --> 16:39.125
Then you do of making it as a professional actor.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.166
-The critics will attack you.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.250
They say, ignore them with all your might.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.500
And that's what I will do.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.625
'Cause I am a performer. Might keep me humble.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.542
So thank you. -Mmm hmm.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.166
-I've only been at this a short time. I already have a hit play.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.417
And I have a commercial audition coming up, so...

16:56.458 --> 16:58.875
I'm about to blow up -I hope so.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.875
And good luck with your audition.

17:00.917 --> 17:04.166
-And you don't need luck, when you have talent.

17:04.208 --> 17:06.250
-Okay! Those numbers are more like it.

17:06.291 --> 17:10.208
Hudson and Sophie, your numbers are through the roof! Good job!

17:10.250 --> 17:12.500
Whatever you're doing, don't stop.

17:12.542 --> 17:16.000
Guys, where are you This is amazing!

17:16.041 --> 17:18.333
Oh my God, that's incredible.

17:18.375 --> 17:21.417

17:21.458 --> 17:24.792

17:36.375 --> 17:38.750
: Oh my God. Okay you dropped off.

17:38.792 --> 17:42.417
160, 130, that's okay. You know what? Take a break, take a

17:38.792 --> 17:42.417
breather.

17:42.458 --> 17:46.208
Whoo! Wow! That's amazing... That's wild...

17:46.250 --> 17:48.959
'Cause they were like... At a climax then...

17:52.875 --> 17:56.166
Seriously, does anybody know where Hudson and Sophie went to?

17:56.208 --> 17:59.750
-The bathroom, like usual. -No.

17:59.792 --> 18:03.166
But not together...Together. Yeah, sure.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.834
: Alright everyone, let's get started.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.709
We have a lot to get to.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.083
: Shall we? -Robert, why don't you

18:08.750 --> 18:11.083
let me handle this?

18:11.125 --> 18:13.250
I've been a principal a little bit longer than you...

18:13.291 --> 18:15.500
-That won't be necessary Lisa, but thank you.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.500
-Okay.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.041
: Your attention, please!

18:18.667 --> 18:21.041
-Hey!

18:27.208 --> 18:30.208
Robert?

18:36.667 --> 18:40.959
-The tears won't come. -Dig deep! Find your sad place.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.542
: Everyone's listening.

19:02.959 --> 19:06.458
: First item of

19:02.959 --> 19:06.458
business...

19:09.667 --> 19:12.000
Hey, I'm ready.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.417
I was already waiting like, forty-five minutes past my time.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.625
-Yeah, we're sorry about that. We had a little problem earlier.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.625
: Okay.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.750
-Yeah.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.250

19:19.792 --> 19:23.250

19:36.083 --> 19:38.959
-Let's say two years.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.792
"Good Morgen?"

19:47.834 --> 19:51.625
-Yeah, I thought I'd add some humour to it 'cause they're

19:47.834 --> 19:51.625
happy. Right?

19:51.667 --> 19:55.125
-Sure, yeah that is fun. Ah... The line is, good morning.

Let's just try one like that. -Okay...Not as funny.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.083
-We're just going to try it as it's written.

20:01.125 --> 20:04.041
-Good morning. -Not directly into the camera.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.291
Just us, we're your audience. We're just...

20:06.333 --> 20:08.458
: Camera's not here.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.792
-Theatre I would... Theatre that's your audience.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.083
Just so I'm clear. Is he already with her?

20:13.125 --> 20:15.291
Like, where is he Like...?

20:15.333 --> 20:17.375
-He comes into the kitchen. -Right.

-She's sitting there, she's the face of our product.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.500
She's made a pot of coffee.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.375
-Yeah. -He just got dressed, he

20:20.542 --> 20:23.375
comes down and he says...

20:23.417 --> 20:25.333
Good morning.

20:25.375 --> 20:29.125
-She is cast. -Okay, well hopefully we don't

look like siblings or something.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.750
-She's the one. -Good morning.

20:31.792 --> 20:35.291
