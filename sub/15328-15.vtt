WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:05.046
- Guys, come on.
This car is perfect.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.841
- Gabby, it's way more
than we said we'd pay.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.885
- The rest of these
cars are all so...used.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.596
- Yeah, but they're
new to you!

00:13.680 --> 00:17.559
Besides, these cars
have character.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.936
Look...
- [hubcap rattles]

00:20.019 --> 00:21.646
- Gabby, you're lucky.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.773
I had to buy my own
first car--

00:23.857 --> 00:25.608
and it only turned left.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.861
I never did make
it to school.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.612
- Well, I did have my eye on

00:29.696 --> 00:31.281
that sporty little
black number over there.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.284
- That's my car.
- I'll take it.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.120
- How about
a little gratitude?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.456
We are buying you a car.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.124
- I am grateful.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.126
I just prefer to be
grateful in something

00:43.209 --> 00:45.295
where the seats don't
go all the way across.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.088
- You two fight this out

00:47.172 --> 00:49.466
while I go talk to the sales
guy about, you know,

00:49.549 --> 00:52.302
[snaps fingers]
safety stuff, fuel efficiency.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.138
- Maybe sneak a few of
those disgusting donuts?

00:55.221 --> 00:57.265
- You don't know me.

00:57.348 --> 00:59.225
- Those donuts
have been there

00:59.309 --> 01:01.019
since this was a Saturn lot.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.812
- Saturn?
- Mm-hm.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.813
- That's your old
car reference?

01:04.897 --> 01:06.816
[sighing]
My therapist is right--

01:06.900 --> 01:08.985
you are too young for me.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.987
- Charlie, stay away
from those donuts.

01:11.070 --> 01:11.988
You'll get sick.
- Fine!

01:12.071 --> 01:16.034
I'll just go look at...
loan information.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.995
- And that loan information
better not have sprinkles!

01:19.078 --> 01:20.789
- [hissing]

01:22.415 --> 01:24.501
- Gabby, find another
car or we're going.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.671
- Gabby!

01:28.755 --> 01:31.341
I thought I smelled
vanilla body scrub.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.176
- Stuart, what are
you doing here?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.178
You'd better not be
following me again.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.721
- I don't follow you.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.182
We just so happen to go
to the same school,

01:39.265 --> 01:41.684
and grocery store
and your driveway.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.520
Anyway, I'm here
helping my dad.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.147
He owns this lot.
- Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.316
- Yeah, I'll probably end up
running this place some day.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.360
Maybe pass it on
to our kids.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.028
- [gulping, clearing throat]

01:52.111 --> 01:56.699
You stay here. I'm gonna
go walk through your car wash.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.535
{\an8}- I can't believe you knocked

01:58.618 --> 02:00.203
{\an8}that donut out of my hand.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.038
{\an8}- I told you not to test me.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.040
- Can't we just get
the good car?

02:04.123 --> 02:05.542
You're a doctor, Dad.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.377
You could buy this whole
lot, if you wanted.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.253
- I'm a doctor,
not the king of the doctors.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.381
- You're telling me you can't
afford to buy this car?

02:11.464 --> 02:12.882
- Keep up the attitude

02:12.966 --> 02:14.968
and you're gonna walk
out of here without a car--

02:15.051 --> 02:17.053
which would be sad,
'cause I got me a car.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.180
- I got me a car, too.
How's your car?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.724
- My car runs great.
It's new.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.893
- Well, why can't
I get a new one?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.104
I'm newer than
either of you.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.399
- You know what? Let's go
test-drive that car you like.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.276
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.737
I wanna see how it
handles me running you over.

02:34.821 --> 02:41.911
- ♪

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621

02:55.091 --> 02:58.261
{\an8}- Grandma Maggie,
have I ever told you

02:58.344 --> 03:00.388
{\an8}that you have
gorgeous calves?

03:00.471 --> 03:01.264
{\an8}- Calves?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.808
{\an8}Boy, you've asked
for so many things,

03:03.892 --> 03:06.769
{\an8}you've run out of parts
of me to compliment.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.856
{\an8}- We want you to buy us
an educational video game.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.442
{\an8}- It's called
"Cannibal Safari."

03:12.525 --> 03:15.320
{\an8}- We'll also need you to buy
us three more controllers--

03:15.403 --> 03:17.322
{\an8}for party mode.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.990
{\an8}- Party mode?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.117
{\an8}Oh, that sounds like fun.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.453
{\an8}No.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.121
{\an8}- But you're a grandma.

03:25.204 --> 03:28.124
{\an8}Buying our love
is like your one job.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.710
{\an8}- He is not wrong
about those calves.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.670
{\an8}Have you been doing squats?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.214
{\an8}- Family meeting--now.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.508
{\an8}- We're getting a little
sick of the attitudes

03:37.592 --> 03:39.177
{\an8}toward money in this house.

03:39.260 --> 03:44.807
{\an8}- Would now be a bad time to
ask you to chip in on gas?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.184
{\an8}- Seriously?

03:46.267 --> 03:49.270
{\an8}You want us to pay just for
you to come over here?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.356
{\an8}- Here...

03:51.439 --> 03:53.608
{\an8}Atlantic City...

03:53.691 --> 03:57.195
{\an8}wherever.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.323
{\an8}- We've noticed
a disturbing trend

04:00.406 --> 04:02.033
{\an8}with you three lately--
you don't earn anything,

04:02.116 --> 04:05.662
{\an8}so you feel entitled
to everything.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.705
Well, from now on,
I am no longer made of money.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.375
- What happened?
Hospital let you go?

04:10.458 --> 04:14.712
You gotta be quicker
with those paddles, man.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.839
- No, they're saying
we have to get jobs.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.176
- Okay, fine, I'll just
keep doing what I'm doing--

04:20.259 --> 04:23.680
President of
the Gummy Bear Society.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.723
- Sweetie, that's not
work or real.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.852
- Obviously, you've never been
to one of our meetings.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.396
- First, I lose my car,

04:31.479 --> 04:33.856
and then you want
me to get a job?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.358
You guys are so unfair.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.569
- Gabby, I will not have
you acting all spoiled.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.238
We gave you a budget.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.240
If you want that fancier car,
earn the difference.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
End of discussion.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
- We can't even talk about it?
- Nope!

04:45.493 --> 04:47.745
Meeting adjourned.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.831
- Wow. At the Gummy
Bear Society,

04:49.914 --> 04:51.499
we take a vote.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.380
- All right, sweetie,
we need you

04:57.463 --> 04:59.382
to shake out all the coats,
wipe down the racks,

04:59.465 --> 05:01.217
and throw out those
boxes in the back.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.136
- Back? Of the closet?

05:03.219 --> 05:07.765
You'd send a child
to the back of the closet?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.601
- If that child wants
to earn his $3.00.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.770
- Okay, but if I don't
make it out of there,

05:12.854 --> 05:14.772
feed the turtle I'm
hiding under my bed.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.983
But if I do make it out,
I was lying about the turtle.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.403
- Hi, hi, hi!

05:20.486 --> 05:22.030
We need to borrow
some of that stuff

05:22.113 --> 05:24.907
y'all keep beside
the refrigerator.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.661
- You want our wine?
- If you're offering.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.623
- We're having a mixer for Doris
from our prayer circle.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.168
- Yeah, prayers didn't work.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.754
Her husband lived.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.464
- Hey, guys.
- There you are.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.591
Did you figure out how you're
gonna earn some money?

05:41.674 --> 05:43.426
- Yeah, I might've
had a thought.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.178
Here, Barry.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.474
- Is that the Mahary's dog?

05:49.557 --> 05:51.934
- They named that
dog Barry Mahary.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.520
[laughs]
That's animal cruelty.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.355
- What are you doin'
with the dog?

05:56.439 --> 05:57.356
Walking it? Grooming it?
Feeding it?

05:57.440 --> 06:01.152
- Hm, all viable options
I did not think of.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.820
I just figured once they
notice he's missing,

06:02.904 --> 06:06.115
they'll offer
some kind of reward.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.700
- Boy, what is
wrong with you?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.286
You can't just
kidnap someone's dog.

06:10.369 --> 06:14.791
- This is what happens when
children have unstructured time.

06:14.874 --> 06:19.128
Maybe if we structured it
around, say, "Cannibal Safari,"

06:19.212 --> 06:21.005
the best game ever.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.091
- You know, I have
a grandson about your age

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
with a birthday coming up.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.677
I was going to get him
knitting classes,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.846
but do you think this game
would be better?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.807
- If you got him that game,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.935
you'd be the coolest
grandparent ever.

06:34.018 --> 06:39.190
- Thank you for the tip.
- Thank you for the tip.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.025
Hang on, hang on,
Grandma Maggie.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.070
I have a lot of very valuable
advice to dispense.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.905
Are there gonna be more
clueless grandparents

06:45.988 --> 06:48.407
at this prayer group thing?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.660
- The room is full of them.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.703
See, the older
you get, James,

06:52.787 --> 06:57.291
the more you've gotta
get right with The Big Guy.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.836
Now, I had to start early.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.380
I've done some things.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.010
- Guys! Guys! I can
get the car I wanted.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.555
- Oh, you got a job?
- Better.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.390
Stuart got his dad to give
me the family discount.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.058
Now it's in the budget.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.893
- I'm not gonna allow you

07:15.977 --> 07:17.687
to use this boy
to get a discount.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.564
- I'm not using Stuart.
He's using me.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.399
- How do you figure that?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.234
- Because he's him, I'm me,

07:23.317 --> 07:25.736
and I'm givin' him
the time of day.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.030
- Girl, you are not
all of that.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.574
Get a job.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.910
- Hey, I found a quarter
while I was cleaning.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.370
Can I keep it?
- Absolutely.

07:34.453 --> 07:38.040
In fact, because you've
been working so hard,

07:38.124 --> 07:41.043
you can keep
any money you find.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.046
- Cool! Because I
also found this $20.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.800
Now I can retire and spend
more time with my family.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.432
- STEPHANIE: [muffled]
Just the person I wanted to see.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.059
- I've never been
more attracted to you.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
- No, this stuff
is for Gabby.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.439
I saw Stuart's dad was hiring
when we went to the lot,

08:01.522 --> 08:07.153
so, I marched down there
and got you a jo-o-o-ob.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.654
You start tomorrow.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.407
- What? I'm supposed to stand
around holding a sign?

08:11.490 --> 08:12.909
- No, that would be silly.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.745
You're supposed to spin
it--dressed as Lincoln.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.623
- Fine.
How hard can it be?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.666
- CHARLIE: [chuckling]

08:22.335 --> 08:24.295
- [objects clattering]

08:24.378 --> 08:25.963
- I hate this!

08:26.047 --> 08:29.425
- Don't worry.
It'll be easier in a mask.

08:29.508 --> 08:32.094
- Sweet sign, Gabby.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.764
- Aaron, buddy,
take a seat.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.683
We want to talk to you
about the closet.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.019
- Aaron, sweetie,
when someone is paying you

08:40.102 --> 08:42.395
three whole dollars
to do a job,

08:42.480 --> 08:44.106
you need to finish that job.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.485
- Job? Come on, Steph,
that wasn't really a job.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.820
That was just
your sneaky way

08:49.904 --> 08:52.448
of getting me to throw away
Dad's old t-shirts.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.617
- You tried to throw
away my band shirts?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.285
- The New York Philharmonic
is not a band.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.455
And why did you
turn this on me?

08:59.538 --> 09:01.165
Aaron, get back to work.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.209
- I don't have to.
I found 20 bucks.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.586
I am stinkin' rich.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.672
- Aaron, sweetie,

09:07.755 --> 09:09.006
money you find isn't worth
as much as money you earn.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.634
- I may be little,

09:11.717 --> 09:15.388
but I know that's
not how money works.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.687
- Great. You're
making dinner.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.981
- No, I'm hiding
a $10 bill in here,

09:25.064 --> 09:27.650
so Aaron'll find it
when he cleans the kitchen.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.485
Aaron thinks that finding
money in the closet

09:29.568 --> 09:31.320
was a one-time thing.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.698
But if he keeps finding money,
he'll keep working.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.579

grandparents--

the kind that give me money.

paid you for advice?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.211

cool for their grandkids,

- James, taking advantage
of grandparents

09:58.139 --> 10:00.224
is not what we had in mind
when we said "earn money."

10:00.308 --> 10:03.728

of perfume out of money?

10:16.991 --> 10:20.036
- Okay, I'm ready.
Where should I start?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.872

the island?

10:22.955 --> 10:25.249

Oh, I hid the wrong bill!

everywhere.

anything out of this.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.877
If you want to
understand your grandson,

11:09.960 --> 11:12.421
you need to be up
on the current slang.

11:12.505 --> 11:17.551
- But try as I may,
I just can't sound "street."

11:17.635 --> 11:21.555

supposed to use slang yourself.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.933
It sounds desperate.

it's not that hard.

about it, James.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.760
Barbara is paid in full.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.596
Peace out, "B"!

12:02.680 --> 12:04.265
- Still desperate.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.434
Now if the customers pay in
advance, you need to tell me.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.018
How much did we get?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.937
- Oh, I got something
better than money.

handicapped placard.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.279
Now I get the good
parking at church.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.698
- And how does that
pay my bills?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.658
Look, I'll let this one slide,
but cut me out again

12:22.741 --> 12:23.742
and I might have
to cut you loose.

12:23.826 --> 12:29.582

you gonna get clients?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.333

19:42.681 --> 19:45.475
So...okay!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.021
- Oh, I'm starving.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.773
Maybe I can drive you guys
in my fancy new car.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.901
Thanks again, Steph.
- You're welcome.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.444
- Breakfast is on me.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.696
I found a two dollar bill
wrapped around the TV remote.

19:59.781 --> 20:02.492
- So, we tried to teach
them the value of money,

20:02.576 --> 20:06.413
and Gabby got her fancy car
without earning it,

20:06.496 --> 20:09.082
James gets whatever
he wants from my Mom,

20:09.166 --> 20:10.918
and Aaron keeps
"finding" money

20:11.001 --> 20:14.504
because you want him
to stay little forever.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.632
- Yeah, that's about right.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.009
- How did it get so bad with
money in the first place?

20:19.092 --> 20:20.928
- What is going on
with our credit card?

20:21.011 --> 20:24.473
This statement
is eight pages long.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.475
- Wait up!

20:26.558 --> 20:29.853
Did someone say pancakes?!

20:32.105 --> 20:47.788
