<b>No one's carrying the</b>
<b>load for either of us.</b>

39:15.431 --> 39:17.367
<b>- He does 50/50 at the all</b>
<b>the time, you know?</b>

39:17.433 --> 39:19.202
<b>- And I'd be a fool to try and</b>
<b>take the rein on a lot</b>

39:19.269 --> 39:20.970
<b>of the things that he excels at.</b>

39:21.037 --> 39:22.672
<b>- I appreciate where you're all</b>
<b>coming from on this.</b>

39:22.739 --> 39:25.041
<b>Let's get into a decision</b>
<b>[inaudible].</b>

39:25.108 --> 39:27.210
<b>- If I base it strictly on</b>
<b>today's work,</b>

39:27.277 --> 39:29.045
<b>we come back and forth</b>
<b>with this ping-pong.</b>

39:29.112 --> 39:31.714
<b>If I look at the three tattoos</b>
<b>we've seen this week,</b>

39:31.781 --> 39:33.950
<b> <i>Old Town</i> </b>
<b> <i>definitely edges them out.</i> </b>

39:34.017 --> 39:35.418
<b>My vote is for Empire State.</b>

39:35.485 --> 39:37.220
<b>- I'm gonna vote Empire State.</b>

39:37.287 --> 39:39.522
<b>- My vote is also for Empire</b>
<b>State Studio.</b>

39:39.589 --> 39:42.725
<b>The judges have</b>
<b>decided, Empire State Studio,</b>

39:42.792 --> 39:47.397
<b>you do not have what it takes</b>
<b>to be Master Shop.</b>

39:47.397 --> 39:49.065
<b>- I think you guys are solid.</b>

39:49.132 --> 39:50.433
<b>- It's always tricky putting</b>
<b>yourself on the line,</b>

39:50.500 --> 39:52.168
<b>and coming back, it takes balls.</b>

39:52.235 --> 39:55.472
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and move out.</b>

39:55.538 --> 39:57.040
<b>- I don't think we deserved</b>
<b>to go home.</b>

39:57.106 --> 39:58.675
<b>- No. Not on this one.</b>

39:58.741 --> 40:00.410
<b>We had to say our piece</b>
<b>at the end there, dude.</b>

40:00.477 --> 40:03.179
<b>- Yeah. That was good, man.</b>
<b>I'm proud of us.</b>

40:03.246 --> 40:05.181
<b>- We went for it, but I'm not</b>
<b>a sore loser.</b>

40:05.248 --> 40:06.583
<b>I wouldn't have had</b>
<b>another choice</b>

40:06.649 --> 40:08.351
<b>but to bring you, Marv,</b>
<b>'cause--</b>

40:08.384 --> 40:10.487
<b>- Thanks, man. To work like</b>
<b>that, so close like that,</b>

40:10.553 --> 40:12.922
<b>I learned a lot.</b>
<b>- I think you're amazing.</b>

40:12.989 --> 40:13.923
<b>- Let's hit it.</b>

40:13.990 --> 40:16.926
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>
