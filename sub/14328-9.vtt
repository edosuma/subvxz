LIVING IN SHAME
FOR MANY MONTHS

20:33.732 --> 20:35.867
DOING VARIOUS ODD JOBS.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.303
THEN I CARED HOW
MISERABLE YOU WERE

20:38.370 --> 20:40.706
WITHOUT MY MUY,
MUY MACHONESS.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.474

20:42.541 --> 20:45.711
{\an1}SO, I DECIDED TO HELP YOU

21:02.227 --> 21:05.330
{\an1}IN FACT, THIS WAS ALL PART
OF MY DIABOLICAL PLOT.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.899
{\an1}YOU SEE, JUANDISSIMO
ENDED UP WORKING

21:07.966 --> 21:09.668

21:09.735 --> 21:11.637
{\an1}AND HE IS THE WORST
COOK EVER!

21:11.703 --> 21:13.639
MY MANY PASSIONATE TEARS

21:13.705 --> 21:15.941
WOULD SOMETIMES DROP
INTO THE FOOD.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.643
SO, I CONCOCTED THIS PLAN

21:17.709 --> 21:19.144
SO THAT HE WOULD
GO BACK TO REMY

21:19.211 --> 21:21.013
{\an1}AND STOP RUINING
ALL MY MEALS!

21:21.079 --> 21:23.815

21:32.791 --> 21:35.193
REMY, YOU WERE
VERY, VERY BAD.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.528
AND I SHOULD PUNISH YOU

21:36.595 --> 21:38.830
BY NOT GIVING YOU BACK
YOUR FAIRY GODPARENT.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.166
BUT I HAVE A BETTER
PUNISHMENT FOR YOU.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.102
YOU CAN HAVE HIM BACK...

21:44.169 --> 21:46.438
BUT HE HAS TO COOK
ALL OF YOUR MEALS!

21:46.505 --> 21:48.507
{\an1}HA HA! THINK OF
THE STOMACH PAIN!

21:48.573 --> 21:50.475
