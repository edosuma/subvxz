01:05.300 --> 01:09.200
- Guess how fast we're going now.
- I don't care, I'm having a baby!

01:09.500 --> 01:12.400
Hundred and five miles an hour,
you believe that?

01:17.700 --> 01:20.400
Reese, you just passed the hospital!

01:21.800 --> 01:25.300
- The baby's coming, he's coming now!
- All right, all right, hold on.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.400
- Okay, but I think he might be stuck.
- Grab onto something. Ready?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.600
One, two, three!

01:36.900 --> 01:39.400
It's a baby boy.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.600
I'm happy that Waffle House
was okay with me coming here...

01:44.800 --> 01:46.900
...to talk to y'all about
my day-to-day.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.900
And, y'all, that's pretty much,
in a shell...

01:50.200 --> 01:52.400
...what it's like to manage
a Waffle House.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.000
Ma'am, I don't know what else
you want me to say to them.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.600
And I'm also gonna need to know
where your commode's at.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.500
Okay, let's give him a round
of applause. Thank you.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.500
Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.
Ricky, is your father here?

02:04.800 --> 02:08.000
No, ma'am.
I haven't seen my daddy in years.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.400
But my mama say he's out
racing cars...

02:10.400 --> 02:12.800
...and, well, dipping his wick
in anything that moves.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.500
Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're gonna move on to Brennan.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.500
Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.100
Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.
You'll be my best friend forever.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.000
- His job is like as a prison guard.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.100
Excuse me, darling.
I'm Reese Bobby.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.600
I'm here for career day
with my son, Ricky.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.400
- Dad!
- Hey there, boy!

02:33.700 --> 02:36.500
Man, you got big. How long's it been?
Three, four months?

02:36.700 --> 02:38.600
- Ten years.
- Ten years?

02:38.800 --> 02:41.000
Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.800
Mr. Bobby,
there's no smoking in here.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.800
It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.700
Okay, I am a semi-professional
racecar driver...

02:49.000 --> 02:51.500
...and an amateur tattoo artist.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.800
And the first thing you gotta learn
if you're gonna be a racecar driver...

02:57.000 --> 02:58.400
...is you don't listen to losers...

02:58.700 --> 03:02.000
...like your know-it-all teacher here.
- Okay, I think that's enough.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.200
Your teacher wants you to go slow,
and she's wrong...

03:05.400 --> 03:08.900
...because it's the fastest who gets paid
and it's the fastest who gets laid.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.500
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm talking about.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.200
You people are in the wrong
on this one!

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
So in the wrong!

03:18.700 --> 03:22.400
This is egregious,
do you hear me? Egregious!

03:25.800 --> 03:29.000
We were cellmates together, Andy.
You got payback coming!

03:31.400 --> 03:32.600
Dad!

03:32.800 --> 03:35.300
Don't listen to these people, Ricky.
You're a winner.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.400
You got the gift. Always remember,
if you ain't first, you're last.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.200
If you ain't first, you're last.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.400
- See you when you're grown up.
- Dad! Come back, Dad!

04:03.600 --> 04:05.200
It's a hot one here in Talladega...

04:05.500 --> 04:10.000
...and this crowd of over 180,000
is enjoying one heck of a day.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.700
Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.
Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.300
All right, fellas, let's go.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.000
Looking good. Yes, come on.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.400
Keep it up, baby.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.800
- All right, way to go.
- Go, way to go.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.500
Nice jack work, Ricky.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.500
Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.700
- Shake and Bake!
- Terry, it's all on you, bro. You go.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.100
Go, baby, go.
Wait, what are you doing?

04:58.300 --> 05:01.000
- I gotta take a piss.
- Go, go, go!

05:01.300 --> 05:03.800
It doesn't matter, Lucius.
We're in last place. Relax.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.800
Jeez, I gotta go take a whiz.
Get off my ass.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.900
You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.600
That's why this group right here
is the laughingstock of NASCAR.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.500
Face it, we suck.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.400
It's not always bad to be in last place.
Here's some things we can focus on:

05:18.500 --> 05:21.600
One, we tried hard.
And two, we're still dear friends.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.200
Glenn, shut up.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.000
I see Terry.
He's having a chicken sandwich.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Hey, fellas! These are really good.
You should try one.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.000
That place actually makes
a nice sauce.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.400
Let me eat this,
then I gotta make a phone call...

05:35.500 --> 05:38.400
...then I'm coming back, all right?
- This is the bottom line.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.400
If we don't get that car
back on the track...

05:40.600 --> 05:43.200
...our sponsors are gonna
shit a chicken.

05:43.500 --> 05:48.400
Now, is there anyone out there
who wants to go fast? Anybody?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.600
I wanna go fast.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.500
Hey, get him a suit. Hurry up,
make it snappy. Let's go.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.900
- Hustle up, hustle up.
- Hey, man!

05:58.200 --> 06:01.600
Remember when we got kicked out of
biology for playing with Matchbox cars?

06:01.800 --> 06:04.300
- Yeah!
- Who's retarded now?

06:04.600 --> 06:07.600
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doing after this?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.200
- After the race?
- Yeah.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.400
I don't know, but it feels like
we're wasting a lot of time.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.600
No, I know, I know.
I'm just excited, man!

06:14.800 --> 06:18.200
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.
- Hey! I love you!

06:18.400 --> 06:19.900
- What?
- Nothing.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.900
Shake and Bake! Get some!

06:24.000 --> 06:27.300
You're my best friend!
You're my best friend!

06:27.500 --> 06:29.200
- Okay, then!
- I'm in there with you!

06:29.400 --> 06:31.200
- I gotta get going!
- Go, go!

06:36.300 --> 06:38.500
- Yeah!
- That's Ricky, baby!

06:38.700 --> 06:40.000
That's my boy, Ricky!

06:44.400 --> 06:46.500
Hey, Ricky,
just remember one thing:

06:46.800 --> 06:49.700
If you wreck that car,
that's 200 grand out of your pocket...

06:49.900 --> 06:51.900
...so let's take it nice and slow, okay?

06:52.100 --> 06:55.800
With all due respect, Lucius,
I'm gonna do some driving.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.600
Excuse me, coming through.

07:02.100 --> 07:06.000
Apparently, we've got a situation for
the Laughing Clown, number 26 car.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.000
Terry Cheveaux is refusing to drive.
One of his crew members...

07:09.200 --> 07:10.500
...has taken the wheel.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.800
Hey, just wanted to share a little piece
of personal information with you.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.300
I got a chubby right now...

07:15.400 --> 07:18.600
...because this is one of the most
awesome experiences of my life...

07:18.600 --> 07:20.400
...because I'm getting to
drive a racecar!

07:20.400 --> 07:23.200
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

07:40.900 --> 07:42.600
Wow, that was cool.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.700
Come on, come on.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.500
The big story from Talladega:

07:54.600 --> 07:58.000
Little-known jack-man Ricky Bobby
places third in the Dennit machine.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.400
Ricky, first of all,
where did you learn to drive like that?

08:01.600 --> 08:05.600
In a car.
Car handle really good. Yeah.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.600
Can you speak up, Ricky?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.600
A car.
It handled real good.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.200
So, what do you think, Mr. Dennit?
He sure can drive.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.800
He's got guts.
Dennit Racing needs a racer like him.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.800
Come on, Dad.
He's just a stupid cowboy.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.500
Look how bad he is
in that interview.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.500
Junior, driving has got nothing
to do with interviews.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.600
I just wish to hell you had
a little more stupid cowboy in you.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.400
I felt like I was on a spaceship and...

08:31.600 --> 08:33.100
I'm not sure
what to do with my hands.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.200
Be good to hold them down
by your side.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.400
We're really happy
with what was going on.

08:39.700 --> 08:44.500
And at the end of the day, you know,
you gotta be happy.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.600
- What did you say his name was again?
- His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.500
Ricky Bobby?
He's got two first names.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.600
Whatever his name is,
let's get him over here.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.000
Everything ended up fine.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.400
Yeah, okay, everything was fine.
Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.900
Ricky Bobby, a force to be
reckoned with, possibly...

09:03.100 --> 09:04.400
...in the near future.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
Ricky Bobby with yet another
impressive win.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
He is dominating NAS CAR.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.400
First or last, baby, you know it!

09:11.400 --> 09:14.400
I've never seen a driver who
wants to win more than this guy.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.000
I could get used to
this winning thing!

09:30.400 --> 09:35.800
Dennit Racing Incorporated
has decided to field an additional car.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.900
And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby...

09:39.200 --> 09:43.200
...who's been like a son to me,
only better...

09:43.500 --> 09:46.800
...I'm naming Cal Naughton Jr.
As the driver.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.400
All right.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.400
- Cal Naughton.
- Hey...

09:52.500 --> 09:55.200
...we just want to say to all
you other drivers out there...

09:55.500 --> 09:58.500
...if you smell a delicious,
crispy smell after the race...

09:58.500 --> 10:01.800
...it's not your tailpipe,
it's a little bit...

10:02.000 --> 10:03.500
...of shake...

10:03.500 --> 10:06.000
And then bake.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.500
Shake and Bake!

10:07.800 --> 10:10.300
- That's our nickname.
- Get used to hearing it.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.300
And Ricky Bobby wins...

10:12.600 --> 10:14.800
...with Cal Naughton Jr.
Finishing second.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.300
- Yeah!
- Hey, man!

10:18.800 --> 10:20.700
- Shake...
- And bake!

10:22.500 --> 10:25.400
Hey, driver! Drive these.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.400
Please be 18.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.800
You want to make this out
to Charlotte?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.500
Hey, excuse me, Ricky.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
- Hey, Dale.
- Hey, can I get your autograph?

10:47.600 --> 10:50.800
- Sure. Who do I make this out to?
- It's for me. I think you're awesome.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.400
- Don't tell the other drivers.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.000
I'll see you out there.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
Absolutely, ma'am,
I'd love to sign your baby.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
You're not gonna wanna wash
that forehead.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.400
- That's right, Powerade's number one.
- Not just for hydration, for vitamin.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.000
No, it's me,
it's me, Susan, your assistant.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
Gotta watch it when I get into
autograph mode.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.400
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,
I shouldn't have been standing.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.100
I'm Ricky Bobby.
Christmas is right around the corner...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.300
...and what better gift
to give a loved one...

11:16.400 --> 11:18.100
...than the Jackhawk 9000?

11:18.300 --> 11:19.600
Available at Wal-Mart.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.200
When you work on
your mysterious lady-part stuff...

11:22.500 --> 11:25.800
...you should have the right tools too.
So that's why you should use...

11:26.100 --> 11:27.900
...Maypax, the official tampon
of NASCAR.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.800
I'm Ricky Bobby.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.300
If you don't chew Big Red,
then f*** you.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.900
Prune candy.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.500
- You happy?
- I'm very happy.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.200
- Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
- And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.600
Urging you never to travel
to Tijuana.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.600
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

11:50.800 --> 11:52.900
Okay, I'm starting to get sick.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.800
Dick Berggren in Las Vegas,
Victory Lane, for Fox Television.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.900
Ricky Bobby, today's big winner.
Heck of a win for you today...

12:00.200 --> 12:04.200
...but it seems as if you either win
or crash the car trying to win.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.500
Well, Dick, here's the deal.
I'm the best there is, plain and simple.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.000
I mean, I wake up in the morning
and I piss excellence.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.200
And nobody can hang with my stuff.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.500
You know, I'm just a big, hairy,
American winning machine.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.600
If you ain't first, you're last.
You know what I'm talking about?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.200
That phrase is trademarked...

12:20.400 --> 12:22.800
...not to be used without permission
of Ricky Bobby Inc.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.400
Supper's ready! Come on, y'all!
I've been slaving over this for hours!

12:35.600 --> 12:37.500
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

12:37.700 --> 12:41.100
...or as our brothers
to the south call you, Jesus...

12:41.500 --> 12:47.400
...we thank you so much for this
bountiful harvest of Domino's, KFC...

12:47.500 --> 12:50.501
...and the always delicious Taco Bell.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.500
I just want to take time to say
thank you for my family...

12:53.700 --> 12:57.200
...my two beautiful, beautiful,
handsome, striking sons...

12:57.400 --> 12:59.800
...Walker and Texas Ranger...

13:00.100 --> 13:02.000
...or T.R., as we call him...

13:02.300 --> 13:05.000
...and of course,
my red-hot smoking wife, Carley...

13:05.200 --> 13:07.000
...who is a stone-cold fox.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.800
Who if you were to rate her ass
on 100, it would easily be a 94.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.400
Also wanna thank you for
my best friend, Cal Naughton Jr...

13:14.500 --> 13:16.400
...who's got my back
no matter what.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.600
Shake and Bake.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.900
Dear Lord baby Jesus, we also
thank you for my wife's father, Chip.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.400
We hope that you can use
your baby Jesus powers...

13:24.500 --> 13:27.400
...to heal him and his horrible leg.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.200
And it smells terrible and
the dogs are always bothering with it.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.000
Dear tiny infant Jesus, we...

13:33.200 --> 13:35.000
Hey, you know, sweetie...

13:35.700 --> 13:37.400
...Jesus did grow up.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.600
You don't always have to
call him "baby."

13:39.600 --> 13:41.400
It's odd and off-putting
to pray to a baby.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.500
Well, I like the Christmas Jesus best
and I'm saying grace.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.300
When you say grace, say it to
grownup Jesus, teenage Jesus...

13:47.600 --> 13:49.000
...bearded Jesus,
whoever you want.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.500
You know what I want?

13:50.500 --> 13:55.200
I want you to do this grace good,
so that God will let us win tomorrow.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.200
Dear tiny Jesus...

13:57.400 --> 14:02.200
...in your golden-fleece diapers,
with your tiny, little, fat, balled-up fists...

14:02.500 --> 14:04.800
...pawing at the air...
- He was a man. He had a beard.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.400
Look, I like the baby version the best,
do you hear me?

14:07.700 --> 14:09.400
I win the races and I get the money.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.200
Ricky, finish the damn grace.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.200
I like to picture Jesus
in a tuxedo T-shirt...

14:16.400 --> 14:19.000
...because it says, like,
"I wanna be formal...

14:19.300 --> 14:21.000
- Right.
...but I'm here to party too."

14:21.200 --> 14:23.500
Because I like to party,
so I like my Jesus to party.

14:23.700 --> 14:27.300
I like to picture Jesus as a ninja
fighting off evil samurai.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.400
I like to think of Jesus,
like, with giant eagle's wings.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.600
And singing lead vocals
for Lynyrd Skynyrd...

14:34.800 --> 14:36.600
...with, like, a angel band.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.500
And I'm in the front row,
and I'm hammered drunk.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.500
Hey, Cal?
Why don't you just shut up?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

14:43.900 --> 14:49.300
Dear 8-pound, 6-ounce,
newborn infant Jesus...

14:49.700 --> 14:51.400
...don't even know a word yet...

14:51.700 --> 14:55.600
...just a little infant and so cuddly,
but still omnipotent...

14:55.900 --> 15:00.400
...we just thank you for all the races
I've won and the 21.2 million dollars...

15:02.800 --> 15:04.300
Love that money!

15:04.600 --> 15:06.900
- That I have accrued
over this past season.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.300
Also, due to a binding
endorsement contract...

15:09.500 --> 15:11.900
...that stipulates I mention
Powerade at each grace...

15:12.200 --> 15:14.400
...I just wanna say that
Powerade is delicious...

15:14.500 --> 15:16.700
...and it cools you off
on a hot summer day.

15:16.900 --> 15:22.600
And we look forward to Powerade's
release of Mystic Mountain Blueberry.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.200
Thank you for all your power
and your grace, dear baby God. Amen.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.500
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.000
Let's dig in!

15:29.200 --> 15:32.200
That was a hell of a grace, man.
You nailed that like a split hog!

15:32.500 --> 15:34.200
I'm not gonna lie to you, it felt good.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.100
Dad, you made that grace your bitch.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.600
Hey, boys, I wanna see
some napkins in the lap.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.200
Boys, how was school today?

15:40.400 --> 15:43.400
I threw a bunch of Grandpa Chip's
war medals off the bridge.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.000
Sounds like a good day.
Texas Ranger, how about you?

15:47.200 --> 15:50.500
Well, the teacher asked me what
was the capital of North Carolina.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.600
I said, "Washington, D.C."

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
- Bingo.
- Nice.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.800
She said, "No, you're wrong."
I said, "You got a lumpy butt."

15:58.200 --> 16:01.400
She got mad at me and yelled at me
and I pissed in my pants.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.400
And I never did change
my pee pants all day.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.600
I'm still sitting in my dirty pee pants.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.100
I wet my bed until I was 19.
There's no shame in that.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.700
I get emotional because
you guys are working so hard.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.900
I'm just so proud of you.
You remind me of me...

16:18.200 --> 16:19.700
...precocious and full of wonderment.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.800
Tell you what, Ricky,
you are truly blessed.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.400
- These two are two in a million.
- I am.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.600
Just like Carley's tatas.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.900
You won't find another rack like that,
I guarantee.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.800
Thank you, Cal.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.500
That's real sweet of you, Cal.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.500
That's real nice. That's one of
the nicest things you've ever said.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.300
- Well, I mean it.
- Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.200
It comes from my heart, that's why.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.400
I can't hold my tongue.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.000
These kids are my grandchildren,
and you are raising them wrong.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.500
They are terrible boys.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.300
Shut up, Chip,
or I'll go ape-shit on your ass!

16:50.500 --> 16:53.000
I'm gonna scissor-kick you
in the back of the head.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.100
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Turn up the heat.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.800
Go on and get some, boys.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.400
I'm 10 years old,
but I'll beat your ass.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.100
Chip, I'm gonna come at you
like a spider monkey.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.000
Like a spider monkey! Go on.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.400
Chip, you brought this on.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
The greatest generation, my ass.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.200
Tom Brokaw is a punk.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
What is wrong with you?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.700
Chip, I'm all jacked up
on Mountain Dew.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.599
I love that.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
I sure as hell am, Chip.
I love the way they're talking to you.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.500
They're winners.
Winners get to do what they want.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.200
Hell, you're just a bag of bones.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.100
Only thing you ever done with your life
is make a hot daughter.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.300
That's it. That is it!

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
We wanted us some wussies...

17:32.900 --> 17:35.600
...we would've named them Dr. Quinn
and Medicine Woman, okay?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.900
I work too hard for your bull, Chip.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.900
Come here.
You make me hot. Come here.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.400
Everyone just keep eating.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.100
- It's on.
- Come here. Come here.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.900
All right.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.500
I'll hold your hair.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.500
- Hey, Stephen.
- Hey, Ricky.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.500
Got those two tickets
for my special friend?

18:07.700 --> 18:11.400
Yeah, sure do. You know I do, Ricky.
Got them right here, buddy.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.800
Great. Hey,
how's your mama's hip?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.100
She's gonna be all right,
thank you for asking.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.400
- Appreciate it. Hey, good luck today.
- Thanks.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.900
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.800
That boy leaves two tickets
for his daddy at every race...

18:24.100 --> 18:25.400
...and he never shows up.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.300
That's a shame.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.500
The human heart is such a mystery.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.000
- Let's sell these bitches, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.000
- Beer money, huh?
- There you go. Yes.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.600
As the laps wind down,
Jamie McMurray is the leader.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.900
Cal Naughton in second.
Ricky Bobby in third.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.600
What's up, Cal? You ready
for a little Shake-and-Bake-age?

18:46.900 --> 18:49.600
- Hey, buddy.
- Naughton Jr. Is letting Ricky Bobby...

18:49.900 --> 18:53.400
...draft up to him to make
that slingshot move past McMurray.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.200
Can you believe that he would do that
for his teammate?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.000
Set him up that way?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.200
Slingshot, engage.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.400
And there goes Ricky Bobby
on the outside!

19:05.400 --> 19:06.600
That's how we do it.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.400
Makes his move.
Naughton's giving him plenty of room.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.100
What in the hell is he doing, guys?
Get him off of me.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
They touch! They spin!

19:15.100 --> 19:16.700
Snap!

19:18.400 --> 19:19.700
Come on, man!

19:23.900 --> 19:25.800
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.100
Look at that! Ricky Bobby's gonna
try to win the race in reverse.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.000
Man, he wants this win bad!

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
Ricky Bobby wins it in reverse!

19:46.000 --> 19:47.800
Unbelievable!
I love that! That is cool!

19:48.100 --> 19:53.000
Jamie, losing's never fun, but here's
something to pick your spirits up.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.800
It's real nice.
I got it at Target. It's on sale.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.100
Yeah!

20:09.000 --> 20:12.200
- That's it. Another one. Another one.
- All right, man. We did it!

20:12.400 --> 20:15.800
I don't wanna be raining on
your parade, but I gotta tell you...

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
...that was some of the dumbest driving
I have ever seen in my life.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.200
- Thank you.
- And I know you won the race...

20:22.400 --> 20:23.900
...but you're not gonna live forever.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.900
I'm not stupid, Lucius.
No one lives forever. No one.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.200
But with advances in modern science
and my high level of income...

20:31.500 --> 20:35.000
...I mean, it's not crazy to think
I can't live to be 245, maybe 300.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.600
I just read in the newspaper they
put a pig heart in some Russian guy.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.200
Know what...? I mean,
do you know what that means?

20:41.400 --> 20:44.000
No, I don't know what that means.
I guess, longer life.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.000
- Well, no, he didn't live.
- He didn't live?

20:46.200 --> 20:48.800
No. It's just exciting
that we're trying things like that.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.600
- Ricky?
- Hey, Mr. Dennit.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.900
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.500
- She already wasted?
- Celebrating.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.800
She's celebrating.
You feel pretty good today, huh?

20:59.100 --> 21:01.000
Look, Ricky,
early word out of NASCAR...

21:01.300 --> 21:04.000
...is your little obscene gesture's
gonna cost you 100 points.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.500
You know how much that costs us
in sponsorship dollars?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.400
With all due respect, Mr. Dennit...

21:08.700 --> 21:13.600
...I had no idea you had experimental
surgery to have your balls removed.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.800
What did you say?
What was that?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.900
Well, what?
I said, "With all due respect."

21:18.200 --> 21:20.800
That doesn't mean you get to say
whatever you wanna say to me.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.700
- It sure as heck does.
- No, it doesn't.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.500
It's in the Geneva Convention.
Look it up.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.900
I remember your daddy
used to love it.

21:27.200 --> 21:31.800
- This is not my dad... This is my team...
- Used to love it when I used to win.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.500
Now, I suggest you and your wife,
Mrs. Jim Beam...

21:34.500 --> 21:36.700
...you guys go take a chill pill.
Enjoy the win!

21:36.900 --> 21:38.600
- Come on, man!
- Yeah, Ricky. Okay.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.500
Baby, photo op, photo op.
Come on.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.400
Come on, number one.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.400
Hold my hand, baby.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.600
I'll tell you what, though, guys,
that was a hell of a race today.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.500
- Shake and Bake in full effect.
- It's always been like that.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.400
Me and Ricky,
since we were little kids, man.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.800
We go together like Chinese food
and chocolate pudding. Let's face it.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.600
Yeah, but those are two things
that don't really go together.

22:09.900 --> 22:12.400
We go together
like cocaine and waffles.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.300
No, like, for instance,
if I say peanut butter and...

22:15.900 --> 22:17.800
- Ladies, right?
- Yep.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.200
- No, jelly.
- Am I right?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.500
- Jelly?
- You like to put jelly on a lady?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.600
I'm gonna settle this thing.
Let's just get ourselves...

22:24.600 --> 22:28.600
...a whole mess of cocktails,
get drunk and work this thing out.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.500
- Work this thing out.
- That's right.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.400
So I was talking to Nana on Saturday,
and her birthday's coming up...

22:35.400 --> 22:37.800
...but I don't know what to get her.
She's gonna be 88.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.600
Get her a coffin.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.500
Hey, Cal, I'm sorry
about wrecking you today.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.600
- I mean, but that was for the team.
- No, that's cool. That's cool, I know.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.200
I was thinking, though, one time...

22:56.400 --> 23:01.000
...it would be really awesome if, like,
you could slingshot me in for a win.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.700
Yeah, but... Okay, but if you won...

23:04.000 --> 23:06.300
...how am I gonna win?
- Yeah.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.000
- Think about it.
- No, I was thinking about it.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.400
I mean, it's not like
you're finishing 18th.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.500
- There's nothing wrong with silver.
- Nothing wrong with silver at all.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.000
I'm just kidding you, man.
I don't wanna win.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.800
I'll just bury it down inside.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.700
Bury it deep down in there,
and never bring it up again.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.200
It's painful, and I love you!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.200
Get her a gigolo.

23:28.500 --> 23:31.100
- What?
- A guy to have sex with her.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.200
No, she's gonna be 88 and...

23:33.400 --> 23:36.000
You don't stop liking sex
when you're old.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
Well, I was thinking
more along the line of...

23:40.700 --> 23:45.200
- Like, she likes afghans and quilts.
- She's probably got a million of those.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.400
How many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her?

23:48.900 --> 23:51.700
- None.
- Exactly.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.100
Be thoughtful, Glenn.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.000
Don't stop.

24:03.900 --> 24:04.800
What is that?

24:05.100 --> 24:07.600
Someone made a tape of
something dying or something.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.600
Hey, turn that crap off.
What's going on?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.700
I want this music out of my head.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.500
Hey, turn that off!

24:14.200 --> 24:15.900
Turn that off right now!

24:21.500 --> 24:24.200
Why did you stop the jazz music?

24:25.900 --> 24:28.200
Was it not pleasant for you?

24:28.400 --> 24:31.300
No one plays jazz here
at The Pit Stop, okay?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.900
So why is the song on the jukebox?

24:34.200 --> 24:37.400
We keep it on there
for profiling purposes.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.500
We also got
the Pet Shop Boys and Seal.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.300
My name is Jean Girard...

24:44.500 --> 24:48.000
...and I am a racing-car driver
just like you...

24:48.300 --> 24:51.300
...except I am from Formula Un.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.800
I am the greatest one
in the whole world.

24:56.000 --> 25:01.400
I have been following your career
with great interest, Monsieur Bobby.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.200
I can't understand a word
you've said the whole time.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.200
Did you eat peanut butter
or something?

25:06.400 --> 25:09.400
You sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.100
I think what you are hearing
is my accent.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.800
I am French.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.500
You say you're French?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.500
We? No, we are not French.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.900
We're American,
because you're in America, okay?

25:25.100 --> 25:26.600
Greatest country on the planet.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.600
Well, what have you
given the world...

25:28.800 --> 25:32.800
...apart from George Bush, Cheerios,
and the ThighMaster?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.000
- Chinese food?
- Chinese food.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.600
That's from China.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.800
- Pizza.
- Italy.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.400
- Chimichanga.
- Mexican.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.400
Really, smarty-pants?
What did French land give us?

25:44.400 --> 25:48.700
We invented democracy,
existentialism...

25:49.000 --> 25:50.200
...and the blowjob.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.300
- Those are three pretty good things.
- Hey.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.000
Well, that last one's pretty cool.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.900
You know, the 69 with
the head near the... That bit.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.400
We came up with it.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.900
We created the missionary position.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.700
- You're welcome.
- Ricky Bobby...

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
...I have come here to defeat you.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.000
Oh, well, there's strikes two and three
right there.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.200
Did you hear what he just said?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.700
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.800
You are fast, Ricky Bobby...

26:28.400 --> 26:30.200
...but I am faster.

26:30.500 --> 26:34.100
All right, you let go of me,
you Formula One jazz nutjob!

26:34.400 --> 26:36.800
Like the frightened baby chipmunk...

26:37.000 --> 26:39.800
...you are scared by anything
that is different.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.400
I will let you go, Ricky...

26:42.500 --> 26:46.800
...but first I want you to say:

26:48.400 --> 26:51.700
"I love crepes."

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
Don't you say it, Ricky.
These colors don't run.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.300
- I'm not gonna say it.
- Good.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
Hey, look, Frenchy,
I thought about it.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.000
So why don't you go ahead
and break my arm?

27:02.300 --> 27:05.400
I do not want to break your arm,
Monsieur Bobby...

27:05.400 --> 27:07.100
...but I am a man of my word.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
Here's the deal.
He's not gonna break it...

27:09.500 --> 27:12.000
...because I'm gonna slip
out of it right now. Houdini.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.500
Get down, you little pancake.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.200
Someone get me a beer
while I'm here.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.500
But you have forced me to do this.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.500
You are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.500
Just say, "I love crepes."

27:22.500 --> 27:26.400
You know, just to put this in there, I had
a whole mess of crepes this morning.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.600
They're like pancakes,
maybe even better.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.500
- Are they the really thin pancakes?
- Yeah.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.500
They are the really thin pancakes.
It's just a French word for them.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.400
- My God, I love those.
- Put any syrups you want on them.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.400
- I'm saying, think about it.
- They come with cheese sometimes?

27:40.400 --> 27:42.300
Yes, of course,
a fromage-crepe.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.400
Well, why didn't someone
yell that right away?

27:44.700 --> 27:46.400
You know what's in
the crepe suzette?

27:46.400 --> 27:48.600
- Oh, I love the crepe suzette.
- With the sugar...

27:48.800 --> 27:51.400
...and lemon juice, Grand Marnier.
- Sugar and lemon juice.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.200
I wish I could crawl into
one of those right now.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.000
- I'd eat my way out from the inside.
- They are tasty.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.600
Either way this goes, could we
get some after we're done?

28:00.900 --> 28:03.500
- Absolutely. We're gonna do that.
- So, what if you just said:

28:03.700 --> 28:08.000
"I love really thin pancakes"?
That is a fair compromise, no?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.400
- That is a fair compromise.
- Very fair, actually.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.300
No! Because then everyone
would know I really meant crepes.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.000
That's a pretty good compromise.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.100
Why do you want me
to break your arm so badly?

28:18.300 --> 28:21.400
You don't understand
because you don't understand liberty.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
You don't understand freedom.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.400
So you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the Liberty Bell.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.500
Hey. This is just
between you and me, okay?

28:30.700 --> 28:32.900
I mean, forget all these other guys.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.800
But he did give you a pretty
decent out. But it's your call.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.700
What do you think?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.400
- Don't say it.
- Yeah. I'm not gonna say it.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.000
Break it, Pepe Le Pew.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.600
As you wish.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.800
- He actually did it!
- All right. You did it. Back off.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.000
- I didn't say it!
- No, you did not.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.600
Your injury is one
of ignorance and pride.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.500
Hold it right there,
Mr. Fancy Pants Foreigner.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.100
You just broke my bro's arm.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.800
Now you're about to get Tasered.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.000
- Say hello to Dr. Watts.
- Get him, Cal.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.400
I need you all to step away...

29:13.400 --> 29:14.800
...from my driver.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
The hell you talking about, "my driver"?
What are you doing with a gun?

29:18.200 --> 29:20.600
Don't you worry about my gun, Ricky.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.700
Jean Girard is my new boy
at Dennit Racing. He's here to win us...

29:24.000 --> 29:26.600
...an overall-points championship,
something you apparently...

29:26.900 --> 29:29.600
...have no interest in.
He's gonna usher in a new era.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.400
Mr. Dennit, with all due respect...

29:31.500 --> 29:33.800
And remember,
I'm saying, "with all due respect."

29:34.100 --> 29:38.500
- That idea ain't worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.

29:38.700 --> 29:41.800
That's good. That's good fun.
That's good fun, Ricky...

29:42.000 --> 29:44.900
...but that doesn't bother me anymore
because Jean is the future...

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
...Ricky, the past.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.900
So, Jean, introduce me
to your new teammates.

29:49.500 --> 29:53.500
Everybody,
this is my husband, Gregory.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.500
What?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.200
See you at the track.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.300
Did he just say "husband"?

30:00.600 --> 30:04.900
Sweet Lord. Dennit hired a gay
Frenchman as your teammate.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.500
The room's starting to spin real fast.

30:08.300 --> 30:11.000
Because of gayness.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.000
- Cal, I love you.
- Ricky? Ricky! Oh, God!

30:25.200 --> 30:30.000
Fans and NASCAR, everyone is talking
about this new driver, Jean Girard.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.600
Let's find out a little bit more about him
from our reporter, Davey Wesling.

30:33.800 --> 30:37.500
Talented. Eccentric. Dominating.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.200
These are the words
that define Jean Girard.

30:41.800 --> 30:46.300
Before each race, Jean Girard spends
time with his world-class horses...

30:46.500 --> 30:48.600
...who are also gay.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.200
Jean's days are filled
with sun-drenched walks...

30:51.400 --> 30:53.400
...with his beloved husband, Gregory.

30:54.400 --> 30:57.300
Though Gregory is
no stay-at-home spouse.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.400
He's a world-class trainer
of German shepherds.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.800
Rolfe, the Nazi boyfriend.
Up on top!

31:05.000 --> 31:07.400
Very nice. Very nice.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.600
Only time will tell if Jean's foray
into NAS CAR...

31:11.800 --> 31:13.900
...will end up in Victory Lane.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.800
Well, kiss my ass on Sunday.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.000
- Lucius, what the hell is going on?
- The man can drive.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.000
And check out his crew chief
over there.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.500
Won the Nobel Prize
for physics back in '93.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a new track record.

31:47.800 --> 31:51.500
As it stands now, Jean Girard is sitting
on the pole, which is, of course...

31:51.500 --> 31:53.800
...a statement of fact
and in no way a comment...

31:54.000 --> 31:55.800
...on the driver's sexual orientation.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.800
Put a smile on your face?
That's the future of Dennit Racing.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.500
- That make you happy?
- I'm just thrilled, Mr. Dennit.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.600
I love seeing some French guy
break my record...

32:03.900 --> 32:06.700
...while I got my arm wrapped up
like a fricking gordita.

32:06.900 --> 32:08.400
Hello, Ricky Bobby.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.900
What happened last week was
very regrettable and unfortunate...

32:14.800 --> 32:17.700
...and, as a gesture, I would like to...

32:18.000 --> 32:19.500
...sign your cast, please.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.300
Hell, you know what,
get my car off the trailer, guys.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.100
Baby! That's my baby!

32:24.300 --> 32:27.500
Hold on, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky, Rick.
What are you talking about?

32:27.600 --> 32:31.300
Look. I wanna drive. My arm's fine.
So let's get the car off the trailer.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.400
Don't look at me.
Get it off the trailer!

32:33.700 --> 32:37.700
Even with a healthy arm, you don't
have a chance against Jean Girard.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.900
All right, fellas. You heard the man.
Get the car off. Let's go.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.600
You guys heard it.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.400
- What's going on?
- Soon you will know what it is like...

32:46.400 --> 32:51.100
...to be defeated by the hands of
somebody who is truly better than you.

32:52.900 --> 32:56.700
As William Blake wrote,
"The cut worm forgives the plow."

32:56.900 --> 32:59.800
Well, let me just quote the late,
great Colonel Sanders...

33:00.000 --> 33:03.500
...who said,
"I'm too drunk to taste this chicken."

33:03.700 --> 33:05.600
What's that got to do with this?

33:05.800 --> 33:09.400
I got a message for all of them.
Ready? Shake and Bake!

33:09.700 --> 33:13.200
What does that do? Does that
blow your mind? That just happened!

33:13.400 --> 33:16.600
What is that, a catch phrase
or is that epilepsy?

33:16.800 --> 33:19.400
- Shake and Bake. Shake and Bake.
- What?

33:19.500 --> 33:24.300
Listen, you better be careful because
tomorrow you're going to get beaten.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.500
Beaten real bad, cowboy.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.200
- Really?
- Yes!

33:28.400 --> 33:30.400
- I don't want to know.
- That's news to me.

33:30.600 --> 33:34.000
- Tomorrow you'll be in trouble.
- I'll rip you a new one.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.500
There's going to be a croissant
I'm going to take away.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.800
I play for keeps!

33:39.400 --> 33:42.200
I give you one option,
Monsieur Bobby.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.400
As a sign of humility,
if you kiss me on the lips now...

33:45.600 --> 33:49.400
...I will return to Paris and you will
never see me again in NASCAR.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.900
The answer is never!

33:51.100 --> 33:53.700
- I close my...
- Do you hear me? Never ever!

33:54.000 --> 33:56.600
- Well, yes or no?
- That's sick.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.600
Let me tell you, hold on.
Shake and Bake.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.900
Yeah!

34:04.100 --> 34:05.900
What does that mean?
It makes no sense!

34:06.100 --> 34:07.800
This "Shake and Bake,"
it's nonsense.

34:08.100 --> 34:11.400
- Hey, baby. You guys are so smooth.
- Thanks, darling.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.500
Cal, you could say that 10,000 times
and it still wouldn't be enough.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.000
- It fires me up.
- I love it. Say it one more time.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.199
- Shake and Bake!
- Doesn't that feel good?

34:19.400 --> 34:23.400
Yeah! It rhymes,
they're both verbs. It's awesome.

34:46.300 --> 34:49.000
NAS CAR on Fox welcomes you
to Lowe's Motor Speedway...

34:49.199 --> 34:51.600
...where tonight we'll go 500 miles.

34:52.400 --> 34:56.199
The big stories tonight
are at both ends of the grid.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.400
Up front, Larry, the surprising French
Formula One driver, Jean Girard.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.100
And at the opposite end of the grid,
Darrell, Ricky Bobby.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.400
I saw Ricky Bobby last night walking
around with a cast on his arm.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.600
Now, I don't know who he conned
into letting him start this race.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.400
Just keep a camera on him
all night long.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.600
I am so excited.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.400
This is a new era
for Dennit Racing, huh?

35:19.400 --> 35:24.400
So serious all the time
about your big race team.

35:24.500 --> 35:28.100
- Who cares?
- But this is my life. This is my life.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.800
You know what? There's only one
good thing about coming to the races...

35:32.000 --> 35:35.800
...and that is
the vibrations from the cars.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.900
Oh, I love when them cars whiz by.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.600
Can feel the motor...

35:43.800 --> 35:46.100
...running up my legs.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.200
Ricky Bobby, who never met
a sponsor he wouldn't push...

35:51.400 --> 35:53.400
...has a Fig Newton sticker
on his windshield.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
Think NAS CAR will
black-flag him for that.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.900
He sold the windshield!

35:57.200 --> 36:00.800
This sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient, but I love Fig Newtons.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.500
Ricky Bobby started this race
in the back...

36:04.600 --> 36:07.000
...but he's making no friends
on the way to the front.

36:07.200 --> 36:10.800
I'm all about getting to the front tonight,
Lucius. Let's go! Let's move it!

36:11.100 --> 36:13.000
Well, he's driving
like a man possessed.

36:13.200 --> 36:17.000
I'm not even sure he realizes how
much damage he's doing to his car.

36:19.600 --> 36:24.200
Hey, Ricky. You know you're driving
like a pissed-off teenager, okay?

36:24.400 --> 36:26.100
Where is that Frenchy?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.300
I got you, Pepe Le Bitch.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.600
Oh, Ricky Bobby.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.500
Hey, it's me, America.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.100
Yeah, I'm here.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.700
You have spilled my macchiato.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.700
Look at Girard in the 55.

36:50.900 --> 36:54.800
He's made that car three lanes wide,
but he's still fast.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.700
No, no, no, my friend.
This way also closed. Not this way.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.600
Lucius, what's he doing?
He's everywhere at once.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.100
Guy's dangerous, Ricky.
He's like a cobra. Back off!

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
Where's Cal?
I need a little support here!

37:09.500 --> 37:11.000
Tell Ricky I'm on my way.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.200
Damn it!

37:18.500 --> 37:20.100
Hey, Ricky, listen.

37:20.400 --> 37:26.200
Cal blew out his engine.
You have no backup. Back off!

37:26.500 --> 37:29.500
I ain't backing off.
I'm Ricky Bobby, I'm the best there is.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.400
He's too good, Ricky. Lay off!

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
Bobby's boxed in.
There's nowhere to go there.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.400
He's gonna try the outside move again.
I don't know if it's gonna work.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.200
Come on, Daddy!

37:43.500 --> 37:45.100
Come on, Daddy! Whoop his butt!

37:45.300 --> 37:47.800
Send that weird man
back to Indonesia.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.500
- Come on!
- Bobby moves to the outside.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.500
Not a lot of room. He's in the wall!

37:55.600 --> 37:57.800
Bobby is sliding,
slamming into the wall.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.800
He's airborne!

38:07.700 --> 38:10.400
Yep. I'm flying through the air.
This is not good.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.200
- Ricky!
- Cool!

38:22.600 --> 38:24.100
Ricky!

38:31.200 --> 38:32.500
Peaches and cream!

38:36.100 --> 38:38.600
The car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.700
Ricky Bobby appears to be okay...

38:41.000 --> 38:43.400
...but that Wonder Bread car is toast.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.300
Fantastic.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.100
Oh, my God! Ricky!

38:48.600 --> 38:51.400
Hakuna matata, bitches.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.900
It's okay, guys, it's just a wreck.
Ricky can handle it.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.500
Now, that's one of the nastiest wrecks
you'll ever see.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.800
Oh, no, no, no.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
It's all right. You're safe.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.100
- You're safe.
- We got you. We're here.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.600
I'm on fire.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.100
It's all right.
It's all right, you're not on fire!

39:15.400 --> 39:19.100
- You're lying! I'm on fire!
- There is no fire.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.800
- I'm on fire. I don't wanna die.
- Come back here.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.600
But something looks wrong. I mean,
he's running around like he's on fire.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.500
Oh, my God! Help me!
I don't wanna die! Stop, drop, and roll!

39:29.800 --> 39:33.200
- You're not on fire, Ricky Bobby!
- I'm on fire!

39:33.500 --> 39:34.800
You're not on fire.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.300
But I'm not even sure he even knows
where he's at right now.

39:38.600 --> 39:43.400
This makes us all realize the kind
of pressure these drivers are under.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.000
Mr. Bobby, come on down here.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.800
Help me, Jesus!
Help me, Jewish God!

39:49.100 --> 39:50.600
Help me, Allah!

39:52.100 --> 39:53.400
Help me, Tom Cruise!

39:53.400 --> 39:56.100
But how did he get down
to his underwear that fast?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.600
Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft on me
to get the fire off me!

39:59.600 --> 40:01.000
Look. Here, help's coming.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.000
- Wait a minute!
- It's Cal Naughton.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.400
Oh, God! Please don't let
the invisible fire burn my friend!

40:08.500 --> 40:12.000
I got you!
I got you, man! I'll help you!

40:12.300 --> 40:16.000
He's jumping on Ricky, trying
to put the nonexistent fire out.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.700
Now, that's a teammate right there.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.500
This is going downhill fast.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.500
It would be a great time
to go to commercial break.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.800
Help me, Oprah Winfrey!

40:26.600 --> 40:30.600
You know, Larry, there's good days
in racing, and there's bad days.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.100
Ricky Bobby just had himself
a bad day.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.100
He's suffering from catatonic shock.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.800
His injuries are minor, but right now he
can't deal with the trauma of the wreck.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.200
Golly, this is a hard decision.

40:51.400 --> 40:56.300
But I have thought about it,
and I want the plug pulled.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.800
Yeah.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.300
Ma'am, your husband's not dying.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.700
He's just taking a nap.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.200
- Just look at him.
- No, I'm not lying.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.600
I've never seen him
make that noise. Ever.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.300
Got more plugs in him
than a Circuit City.

41:11.400 --> 41:16.200
Oh, baby.
Mama loves you so much.

41:16.900 --> 41:20.400
Hey, Ricky. It's me, Cal.

41:20.700 --> 41:25.000
Just want you to know,
I got your back, bro. No matter what.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.400
There's something
I want to get off my chest...

41:28.500 --> 41:32.500
...and it's about that summer when
you went away to community college.

41:32.500 --> 41:36.200
I got a offer to do Playgirl magazine...

41:37.000 --> 41:38.800
...and I did it.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.200
I did a full spread
for Playgirl magazine.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.600
I mean spread, man.
I pulled my butt apart and stuff...

41:47.300 --> 41:51.200
...and I was totally nude,
and it was weird.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.100
You probably didn't hear about it...

41:53.300 --> 41:55.500
...because I went under the name
of Mike Honcho.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.400
But I just wanted you to know that.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.400
If you could hear me,
if it got into your brain somehow...

42:01.600 --> 42:03.800
...that I spread my butt cheeks
as Mike Honcho.

42:04.100 --> 42:06.900
"Are you there, God?
It's me, Margaret.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.000
Gretchen, my friend, got her period.
I'm so jealous, God.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.200
I hate myself for being so jealous,
but I am.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.500
I wish you'd help me just a little.

42:16.800 --> 42:21.300
Nancy's sure she's going to
get it soon too. And if I'm last..."

42:21.700 --> 42:24.500
Hey, Ricky. Ricky!

42:24.900 --> 42:26.700
Come on, man, wake up.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.600
Are you faking it?

42:31.500 --> 42:35.400
Are you faking it? Fake it!

42:39.900 --> 42:43.400
I don't know how much longer
I can take seeing you like this.

42:44.200 --> 42:48.000
I am not gonna let you die here...

42:48.300 --> 42:50.200
...like some kind of vegetable.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.600
I'm gonna put an end to this
right now.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.500
Get all this crap off you.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
You don't need any of this crap.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.200
This is it. This is how it ends.

43:02.500 --> 43:03.900
This is how Shake and Bake ends.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.800
It's shadow time, buddy.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.800
It's time to go home to Jesus.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.600
Goodbye, buddy.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.500
Oh, wow, you definitely...

43:20.600 --> 43:23.100
You definitely
still got some fight in you.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.600
Okay, maybe we give this
another day.

43:28.500 --> 43:31.400
Middle. I'll go up to the middle.
Let's play some defense!

43:33.600 --> 43:36.400
I just wanna say thanks, doc,
for taking care of our boy here.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.800
- Oh, shit.
- That's a foul! That's a foul!

43:40.100 --> 43:41.500
Doc, give it to me straight.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.900
Is he ever gonna be able
to walk again?

43:44.200 --> 43:47.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought someone
had told you. He's fine.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.900
He found that wheelchair
in the hallway.

43:49.100 --> 43:52.000
His paralysis is
entirely psychosomatic.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.800
But we all need to go along with this,
because he's in a delicate state.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.400
So when you say psychosomatic,
you mean, like...

43:59.700 --> 44:02.200
...he could start a fire
with his thoughts?

44:02.400 --> 44:04.400
No, not at all.
It means it's all in his mind.

44:04.500 --> 44:08.300
I'm saying, sometimes you get a knock
on the head, you get special powers.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.800
It happens all the time.
Read a comic book, okay?

44:11.000 --> 44:12.600
Everyone's real friendly.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.600
It doesn't hurt being Ricky Bobby.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.400
So how's the physical therapy going?

44:17.600 --> 44:20.500
Oh, I gave that up.
Yeah, I gave that up...

44:20.700 --> 44:23.800
...after maybe the first day.
Within the first hour, I gave that up.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.100
I'm through lying to myself,
you know?

44:26.300 --> 44:29.700
It's time to be mature about this
and just face facts.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.400
I bought myself
a hundred-thousand-dollar...

44:32.500 --> 44:33.900
...handicap-accessible van...

44:34.100 --> 44:37.800
...with the captain's chairs and the DVD
plasma screens in the back for the kids.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.400
- You all paid up on that?
- Yeah. That's all paid in full.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.600
It's parked out there.
And then the next thing I gotta do...

44:43.800 --> 44:47.800
...is I just gotta have a sit-down
with Carley and just let her know...

44:49.300 --> 44:54.000
...that it's okay for her to seek
the comfort of other men.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.300
Because she's gotta run wild. You
can't keep something like that back.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.800
Hold on, man. Hold...

45:00.500 --> 45:02.300
- We gotta tell him.
- Now?

45:02.400 --> 45:05.300
No, I don't care what the doctor said,
we gotta tell him now.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.000
Ricky, the doctor told us...

45:07.300 --> 45:10.000
...that we should let you work it out
in your own sweet time...

45:10.200 --> 45:11.400
...but, Ricky, you can walk.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.500
What did you just say?

45:13.600 --> 45:16.700
He's telling you the truth, man.
It's all in your head.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.400
You sick sons of bitches!

45:22.600 --> 45:24.400
I mean, you walk in that door...

45:24.600 --> 45:28.100
...on your two legs,
all fat and cocky...

45:28.400 --> 45:32.800
...and looking at me in my chair,
and you tell me it's all in my head?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I hope that both of you have sons.

45:35.300 --> 45:40.200
Handsome, beautiful, articulate sons
who are talented and star athletes...

45:40.500 --> 45:42.300
...and they have their legs
taken away!

45:42.500 --> 45:44.400
I pray you know
that pain and that hurt.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.800
Don't you put that evil on me,
Ricky Bobby!

45:47.100 --> 45:51.500
Don't you put that on us!
You are not paralyzed!

45:51.600 --> 45:53.400
I am so paralyzed!

45:53.500 --> 45:57.000
- No, no, no! No, he needs to know!
- Getting a little rough on him.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.500
- He's always crying!
- Tough love, it is. Tough love.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.600
- Wake up, idiot!
- You wanna know what I am?!

46:02.600 --> 46:05.100
You wanna see what my life is?!

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
Don't do it.

46:06.700 --> 46:10.700
- You wanna see what's going on here?
- Don't you stick that knife in your leg.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.000
- Man!
- Hold on, hold on.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.600
- Hold on, now. Walk it off.
- Oh, that hurts.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.000
- Oh, my...!
- Walk it off.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.000
Stretch, stretch. Stretch it out.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.600
Hey, man.
You can walk! You can walk!

46:31.800 --> 46:33.500
I can walk!

46:34.200 --> 46:36.600
- I think I touched a nerve.
- Right there.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.500
All right, we got it, we got it.
Hold it right there.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.900
Maybe don't touch it.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.000
- Can you feel it?
- I can!

46:43.300 --> 46:45.500
We'll use this knife to pry it out.
We'll pull it out.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.400
- Now we got two in there.
- Just don't think about it.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.800
- We're going down a bad path.
- Cut around the meat.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.700
I'll cut right here.
Stretch it out.

46:52.900 --> 46:55.200
Just take out a plug of meat.
Just like a deer.

46:55.500 --> 46:58.200
We gotta wiggle it a little bit. That's it.
Can you feel that?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.200
- Yeah, I feel that.
- You are back!

47:00.400 --> 47:01.900
I love you guys!

47:02.500 --> 47:06.300
Hey, I'm sorry, guys. I mean,
I hope your boys don't lose their legs.

47:06.500 --> 47:09.600
- Thanks, buddy.
- So when do I get to drive again?

47:09.900 --> 47:12.900
Well, that's the thing. The doctor
said you suffered major trauma...

47:13.100 --> 47:15.500
...and he thinks you should
take it slow for a while.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.400
Yeah, so, I was thinking, like,
while you're resting up and stuff...

47:19.500 --> 47:22.400
...maybe you could let me win a few.
- Well, there you go.

47:22.600 --> 47:24.400
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Yeah. I'm Ricky Bobby.
I mean, you know how I play it.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.400
- Yeah.
- First or last, right, baby?

47:30.400 --> 47:32.900
- Don't know what I was thinking.
- Besides...

47:33.200 --> 47:36.000
...Dennit Jr. Must be freaking out.
All the money he's losing?

47:36.200 --> 47:37.700
Without me on the track?

47:37.900 --> 47:39.200
I mean, I just laugh...

47:39.400 --> 47:42.300
...thinking about him whining
all the time, bitching and moaning:

47:42.600 --> 47:44.400
"Damn, I wish Ricky was here."

47:44.600 --> 47:46.200
You know what I mean?

47:50.100 --> 47:52.100
What?

47:52.400 --> 47:54.700
Frenchy can drive.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.800
Oh, no.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.400
Very good.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.800
C'est la vie and que sera, sera.

48:32.100 --> 48:35.100
It looks like the NASCAR
has gone French.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.000
Well, in other news, Ricky Bobby...

48:37.200 --> 48:40.300
...is going to be running some test laps
this weekend at Rockingham...

48:40.600 --> 48:42.700
...in an attempt to come back
from his grisly crash.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.400
It's one of the hardest things
to do in racing.

48:46.500 --> 48:49.300
To try to bounce back after
a devastating, violent wreck.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.800
Ricky Bobby was traumatized
during the incident.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.400
All right, baby.
Come on, now.

48:53.400 --> 48:56.800
But today he gets to strap back into
a racecar for the first time since...

48:57.100 --> 48:59.200
...to try to show he can still
get the job done.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.600
- He's gonna be great. Yep.
- He's gonna be great, sure.

49:02.800 --> 49:05.500
Would you stop staring at me like that,
Susan? I swear...

49:05.800 --> 49:08.300
...you are the weirdest little girl
I've ever seen.

49:08.600 --> 49:11.200
Okay, I'm really gonna open it up!

49:14.400 --> 49:17.500
I missed you, Mama Speed.
Ricky Bobby's back.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.400
Wait, how fast is he going?

49:19.400 --> 49:21.100
Twenty-six miles an hour.

49:23.500 --> 49:26.900
What were those things?
Were those the other cars?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.900
Oh, God. So fast.

49:35.100 --> 49:36.800
Go, baby! There you are.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.800
Am I on fire? I'm on fire.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
- No, no, you're not on fire.
- Stretch it out.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.700
- It's okay, baby.
- Take it easy.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.000
- Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick.
- Oh, God.

49:47.300 --> 49:51.000
- Oh, he's in his underwear again.
- Ricky! Please put your clothes on.

49:51.300 --> 49:53.400
He's in his underwear again.
Go get him, fellas.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.900
Oh, Lord.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.000
You know who's gonna be
number one at Dennit Racing?

49:58.700 --> 50:01.600
- Not Ricky?
- I'm gonna windmill you.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.500
Mr. Cal Naughton Jr.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.400
- Come back at him. It's the only way.
- Who are you?

50:07.500 --> 50:09.200
- Number one.
- No.

50:09.500 --> 50:12.800
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Ricky! Come on, man!

50:13.100 --> 50:14.600
It's embarrassing.

50:14.600 --> 50:18.400
The ninjas are trying to get me.
The ninjas are trying to get me.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.500
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

50:20.600 --> 50:23.000
What happened? He's done.
He's done.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.700
That's what's happened.
It's over. He's finished.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.500
What's gonna happen to me?

50:27.700 --> 50:30.700
I feel like I was riding inside
an asteroid or a comet or something.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah, you were going fast.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.300
- Look at that.
- What are we gonna do?

50:35.600 --> 50:38.000
This is ugly.
This is bad for all of us. Look at that.

50:38.300 --> 50:41.200
- I gotta go check on cuckoo bird.
- No, cuckoo's okay.

50:41.400 --> 50:44.100
Why don't you get over there
and settle down Carley for me?

50:44.300 --> 50:46.400
- Could you do that for me?
- Yes, sir.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.000
There you go.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.400
What began as a day
of hope and optimism...

50:51.400 --> 50:54.800
...for Ricky Bobby and his race team
has ended here in sad disappointment.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.300
There we go, boy.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.400
- I lost all muscle control.
- Yeah, you did.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.900
- He just lost his muscle control is all.
- I lost my muscle control.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.600
He's fine.
He just can't control the muscles.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.500
- Thanks for the lift, Hershell.
- Yeah, no problem.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.600
Jenga!

51:26.600 --> 51:27.900
I love you, Cal.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.700
- Good one, kiddo.
- What the hell's going on?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.100
Hey, Ricky, nice of you
to stop by for a visit.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.100
What do you mean, a visit?
This is my house.

51:37.400 --> 51:38.800
Baby...

51:39.000 --> 51:41.200
...shoot. I'm so sorry.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.500
I really...
I didn't want it to be this way.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.200
Hey, what happened
to the family portrait?

51:46.900 --> 51:49.100
You just crudely pasted
your face over mine.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.200
We're getting married, Ricky.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.800
And we're getting matching
leprechaun tattoos.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.900
Isn't that cute?
With a little pot of gold.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.400
Is this some kind of joke?
You guys putting me on?

51:58.400 --> 52:02.400
I was gone three hours.
Dennit just fired me from the team.

52:03.300 --> 52:04.600
Ricky, you and I...

52:04.800 --> 52:08.500
...we both know that this marriage
has been over for a long, long time.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.400
No! I honestly did not know that!

52:11.800 --> 52:16.300
Ricky, you can't race no more.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.400
I'm not going back to being poor
and dancing at the Wizard's Den.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.400
You know, my old boyfriend Greg?

52:23.400 --> 52:25.600
He still works there
and he was crazy.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.800
Baby, stop.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.400
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second.
Let me make sure I got this straight.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.100
Are you asking me for a divorce?

52:35.300 --> 52:37.800
- Yay! Two Christmases!
- Yay! Two Christmases!

52:38.000 --> 52:39.800
Cal?

52:40.100 --> 52:41.900
How could you do this to me, man?

52:42.100 --> 52:45.600
Ricky, your marriage was
a hollow shell.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.500
It was a cruel charade.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.800
She just gave me the 411
on the whole deal.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.500
And you know what else?
You never let me win one time.

52:53.600 --> 52:56.000
I thought we had a good thing going.
Shake and Bake.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.900
You're doing great.
You just keep it up. Keep it up.

52:59.100 --> 53:02.100
And Mr. Dennit told me
that it's my time now.

53:02.300 --> 53:04.400
- Oh, really?
- That Shake and Bake is dead.

53:04.400 --> 53:07.000
And we just came up
with a new nickname.

53:07.300 --> 53:09.600
- It's so good. It's so good.
- I got a new nickname.

53:09.900 --> 53:12.700
The Magic Man.
Now you see me...

53:13.600 --> 53:15.100
...now you don't.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.600
That is the stupidest nickname
I've ever heard.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.400
Is it, Ricky?

53:19.400 --> 53:21.800
Because I think
you wish you thought of it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.500
All right. You got me.
That's an awesome nickname.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.700
I've always had a lot of great ideas.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.900
I also think I might design a car
that's in the shape of a rabbit.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.700
It might poop out little real rabbits out
the back that'll run around the track.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.300
You have live rabbits
being pooped out onto a track?

53:39.500 --> 53:42.200
If I win, I might do a special thing
with David Copperfield...

53:42.400 --> 53:44.600
...where he hides in my car
in the passenger seat...

53:44.800 --> 53:47.100
...and he just flings magic stuff
out the window.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.200
Did you run any of this
by NASCAR?

53:49.400 --> 53:53.000
Watch the mail for that invitation to
the wedding, because I want you there.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.500
- What?!
- I know it...

53:54.600 --> 53:57.500
...that some bad stuff happened
just now, but in time...

53:57.600 --> 53:59.500
The wedding's not for
a couple of weeks.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.400
Why would I come
to your guys' wedding?

54:01.600 --> 54:03.600
- You're gonna get over it
and be my best man.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.300
I'm not gonna be your best man!

54:05.600 --> 54:07.500
Baby, he's not gonna come
to the wedding.

54:07.500 --> 54:11.500
Cal, do you realize the implications
of your actions right now?

54:11.800 --> 54:13.200
What's "implication" mean?

54:13.400 --> 54:14.700
We are no longer friends.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.600
- Why?
- What do you mean, "Why?"

54:18.600 --> 54:19.900
You're wrecking my life!

54:20.200 --> 54:22.800
You just lost your wife.
You just lost your job.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.600
Don't throw out your best friend
because of your anger.

54:26.300 --> 54:29.400
- That's absolutely ridiculous, man.
- Ricky...

54:29.500 --> 54:34.400
...remember, the field mouse is fast,
but the owl sees at night.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.000
That's kind of creepy, ain't it?

54:43.600 --> 54:46.600
- Hey, Ricky, I'll call you tomorrow.
- Shut up.

54:46.600 --> 54:49.400
- Bye, kids. I'll see you next weekend.
- Bye.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.700
Ricky! Boys! Is everything all right?

54:58.000 --> 55:01.600
Mama, we got nowhere to go.
Carley and Cal took everything.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.800
Well, you're home now,
and you got your mama.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.200
Get in here, boys. Come on.

55:05.500 --> 55:08.100
Come on. Get in this house.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.200
Hey, Ricky. Are you on fire?

55:18.000 --> 55:21.300
- Nice denim shorts, dude.
- Hey, shut up, man.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.300
Hump me!

55:39.300 --> 55:41.200
Now, you watch yourself.

55:41.400 --> 55:44.600
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.000
Hey, sorry, man.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.400
Hey.

56:03.700 --> 56:05.600
I lost my license.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.900
That's why I'm on the bus.
I'm delivering pizzas.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.400
Motherfucker,
what makes you think I care?

56:10.700 --> 56:13.500
Shut the fuck up!

56:14.400 --> 56:16.200
I was just telling you that because...

56:16.500 --> 56:19.600
Like I said, I lost my license. I've
been having a lot of problems lately.

56:19.900 --> 56:22.400
Problems? I don't wanna hear about
your damn problems.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.200
Everybody got problems.

56:24.500 --> 56:26.600
My mama got problems.
She just lost her leg.

56:26.600 --> 56:30.400
My cousin Pookie just lost a testicle.
My dog threw up somebody's finger.

56:30.700 --> 56:32.200
That's a problem.

56:32.400 --> 56:35.300
I really regret opening my mouth
and talking to you.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.200
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get out of the road!

56:40.500 --> 56:43.400
Hey, come on, man.
I'm on a bike. Relax.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.800
- Hey, shut up!
- Idiot!

56:49.800 --> 56:51.400
It's open.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.400
Hugalo's Pizza. We are pizza.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.500
- You are pizza?
- Yeah, we are pizza. I gotta say it.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.100
Either close the door or come in.
I got weed in here, cowboy.

57:12.100 --> 57:15.200
You got three pizzas that haven't
been eaten just sitting over there.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.100
I know. I've been calling them
all day trying to get you...

57:18.400 --> 57:20.600
...but they keep sending me
different delivery people.

57:20.900 --> 57:22.600
Trying to get me? Why?

57:22.800 --> 57:24.400
Because I'm your daddy, that's why.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.300
- What did you just say?
- I said, I'm your daddy.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.000
I'm Reese Bobby.

57:31.200 --> 57:36.000
Me and your mama did it in a Rustler
Steak House bathroom when I was 17.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.000
And then you showed up.

57:44.700 --> 57:46.600
Hey, son.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.200
- Son! Son, did this go good?
- No!

57:50.400 --> 57:53.400
- Seems to me like it went pretty good.
- You're not my dad.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.800
- It got a little heated, but...
- Stop talking to me!

57:56.000 --> 57:59.100
Hey, is that a Huffy?
That's a nice-looking bike, boy.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.100
I can't believe it!

58:01.400 --> 58:04.500
I mean, he's been
blowing me off for 25 years...

58:04.600 --> 58:07.200
...and now he wants
to get to know me?

58:07.500 --> 58:09.300
How the hell did he even find me?

58:09.500 --> 58:10.700
I called him.

58:10.900 --> 58:13.800
Are you kidding me?
Mama, why did you go do that?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.700
Son, you need help.

58:15.900 --> 58:18.500
- I know he's a son of a bitch.
- He's scary.

58:18.600 --> 58:22.500
But you're a grown man.
You're delivering pizzas on a bike.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.400
How'd you even get hooked up
with him in the first place?

58:25.700 --> 58:28.400
You probably couldn't tell
by looking at him now...

58:28.800 --> 58:31.200
...but your daddy used to be
a real charmer.

58:31.500 --> 58:36.300
And that night in the ladies' room of
the Rustler Steak House, he chose me.

58:36.600 --> 58:41.100
- In a ladies' room?
- Shut up in here! I'm trying to sleep!

58:41.300 --> 58:44.200
One of you turds is about
to get smacked in the mouth!

58:44.400 --> 58:47.700
Hey, stop yelling at me, okay?
I'm your dad. You're 7 years old.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.600
Don't talk like that.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.400
Hey. Hey there, Lucy.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.500
How you doing?

58:56.800 --> 58:59.400
Oh, hey there, Ricky. Look, son...

59:00.200 --> 59:02.600
...I know you don't
want me to be here...

59:02.800 --> 59:06.800
...but I saw what happened to you
on the television. You saw the fear.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
- I can help you with that, son.
- Really?

59:09.200 --> 59:12.400
What do you care about me or us?
You never even met your grandkids.

59:12.600 --> 59:15.800
- What are you looking at, Popeye?
- Shut up, you little pot-licker.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.400
I'll put you in a microwave.

59:17.500 --> 59:19.200
Now, you show me the DNA test...

59:19.400 --> 59:22.400
...and then maybe I'll say hello
to these swamp rats.

59:22.400 --> 59:27.300
You people shut the hell up! I got
a wife in an oxygen tent trying to sleep.

59:27.500 --> 59:30.500
You better shut up or I'll come
over there and rip a hole in that tent.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.000
Yeah, shut up, Frank!

59:32.200 --> 59:34.600
Go shave your balls,
you dusty old fart!

59:34.800 --> 59:37.300
Okay, I guess they are my grandkids.

59:39.500 --> 59:42.400
I know you, son. I know you well.

59:42.700 --> 59:45.900
You're just like me. Talladega's
coming up in a couple of weeks...

59:46.100 --> 59:48.800
...and I know you wanna win that thing.
- No, I don't.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.100
Listen, Ricky.

59:51.300 --> 59:55.200
I'm 55 years old
and all I got to my name is a car...

59:55.500 --> 59:59.300
...and a duffle bag full of underwear,
and sweet, stinky weed.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.500
How much you selling that weed for,
old man?

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.100
I know I screwed up
raising you as a boy...

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
...but just let me help you as a man.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.100
- Do it, Dad. Get your balls back.
- Go fast again.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.400
Fine. I'll do it.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.800
- But I ain't calling you Daddy.
- Well, what you gonna call me?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.700
All right, Professor Dickweed.
What's the plan?

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.000
Well, basically, what happened to you
is that you saw the fear.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.500
So before you can even think
about any real driving...

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.500
...you gotta make friends with that fear.
So get in the car.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.000
What the hell?!
There's a goddamn cougar in the car!

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.300
I know there's a cougar,
I put it in there.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.500
You gotta learn to drive
with the fear.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.400
Ain't nothing more damn frightening
than driving with a cougar in the car.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.500
- God, where'd you get that thing?
- I trapped it.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.600
Been keeping it in my bathroom
at the motel, feeding it old pizza.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.100
- Now get back in that car, you hear me?
- No, I'm not getting in that car.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.100
Hey, listen to me. If you're calm,
that wondrous big cat will be calm too.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.700
But if you're scared...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.500
...that beautiful death machine
will do what God made it to do...

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.400
...namely, eat you
with a smile on its face.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.600
God, he's just following me
wherever I go.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.300
Well, he's just looking at you.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.100
You're saying if I just calm down,
the cougar will be okay?

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.600
- You got it.
- Damn it. Okay.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.600
Come on, son.
You can do it. Come on.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.400
Oh, come on.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.600
That's it.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.400
- And no sudden moves.
- Like, is this too fast? Oh, man. See?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.600
- That's a little quick.
- You see what he did?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.100
You gotta be a little more deliberate
in your movement.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.900
I'm just gonna get in there.
I'm just gonna grab the handle.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.600
I'm gonna get in and drive that car.
I'm gonna do it calm.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.400
- Calm. Piece of cake.
- I was just trying to stay calm.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.000
- Oh, man!
- Sometime today, son.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.600
Okay, here we go. I'm getting in.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.400
Oh, God, help me!

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.900
- Ricky! Control your heart rate.
- Oh, my God!

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.500
Hey, Mama.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.000
Well, hey there, Ricky. How'd it go?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.600
Well, I was mauled by a cougar...

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.000
...learned nothing about driving,
and my Crystal Gayle shirt was ruined.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.000
But other than that, it went fine.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.400
Where are the boys at?

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:22.100
I dropped them off at Sunday school
at my church about 10 minutes ago.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.400
Anarchy!

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.800
- Anarchy! Anarchy!
- Anarchy!

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:30.500
- There they are.
- What in tarnation?

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.800
- Anarchy!
- I don't even know what that means...

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.200
...but I love it!

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.200
- What in the hell?
- That is it!

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.100
That puts the lid right on the jar!

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.200
- Mama! Mama!
- No, Ricky, no.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.800
I will not have my grandbabies
acting like shiftless, wild hobos.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.000
All right, now, you boys listen up,
and you listen good.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.600
Now, I am declaring Granny Law.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.600
And if you do not obey Granny Law...

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.200
...I will paint your back porch red.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.600
Sorry, Granny,
but you're shit out of luck.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.200
We make the rules, not you.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.400
Hey!

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.300
You're gonna break us
like wild horses, ain't you?

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.600
It's the beginning of a new age.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Hey, Derek, it's Ricky.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.100
Just wondering
if you can ditch school...

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.100
...and take over my shift
at the pizza place...

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.500
...because I got strep throat.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.200
And it's bad. I don't wanna
give it to everyone else.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.600
So call me back.
You know the number.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Hello.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.300
Hey, man. How's it going?
You wanna come over and party?

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.900
Did you just say "party"?

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.600
You know what? No.
Because I still hate you, okay?

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.900
- What are you so mad about?
- What do you think I'm mad about?

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.400
Come on, man, that was last week.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.200
What about the time you ran over
my leg with a car?

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.100
- I let that go that day.
- Yeah, I remember.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.100
Wind is kicking up.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.600
Are you in the hot tub?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Answer me this:
When you're in spa mode...

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.200
...how come the water level
drops in the spa?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.900
Are you pressing the buttons
in the back panel or in the kitchen?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.400
- I just started pressing stuff.
- Hey, don't press all those buttons.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.100
I'm getting bored. You wanna
come over and play G.I. Joes?

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.900
I would love to. No!

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.100
Come on. You know what?
Screw you, man.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.000
Ricky, man, you gotta
cross over the anger bridge.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.100
Come back to the friendship shore.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.900
- "Cross over the anger bridge"?
- Yeah, that's where you're at.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.800
You're stuck on an anger bridge.

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.800
Can you not see why
I'm stuck on the anger bridge?

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.500
Look, I don't know why I'm talking
to you, okay? What is it?

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.100
They got bottomless nachos
at Bennigan's.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.000
God, a whole mess of nachos
sounds good right now.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.600
I don't have a car no more.
Can you come get me?

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.500
I'll get you. Which one of your cars do
you miss the most? I'll bring that one.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.800
- I miss the Hummer.
- I'm coming in the Hummer.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.500
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. No, wait.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.200
Okay. Our friendship is done.
All right?

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.400
- You hear?
- You wanna hang out in your house.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.600
- Come on.
- Screw you, dude. I'm hanging up.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.700
Okay, that's it. Bye.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.200
Oh, man, this is absolutely crazy.
I mean, this is borderline reckless.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.000
Don't you get it? You don't drive with
your eyes, you drive with your heart.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.100
This is just dumb.
I can't see a thing.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.200
You gotta feel the road.
You gotta let it live inside you.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.000
- Are you feeling anything now?
- I'm feeling a little bit.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.200
What do you feel?
Tell me what you're feeling.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.400
I'm feeling the worn wood
of the steering wheel.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.500
- Yeah. What else?
- A little bit of heat.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.000
That's you and the car
melded together.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.600
Yeah, now I'm really feeling it.
I feel like the car could drive itself.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.700
I bet it could. Start her up.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.900
I'm gonna start this car up.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.400
Attaboy. All right, son.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.400
Drive.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.300
I'm embarrassed.
I really thought I could feel it.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.600
You know what? We better hightail it
out of here. Frank's gonna be pissed.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.500
All right.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.100
No, no, Ricky. No blindfold.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.500
Get this highway clean, come on.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.500
I gotta tell you, Granny, this blows.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.100
- How much more of this?
- I don't know.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.000
How many more times are you gonna
toss me the radio in the bathtub?

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.800
- Hello?
- Hey, man. You up?

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.400
- No.
- Wake up. I need to talk to you.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.300
I think your house is haunted.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.600
Hey, come on.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.300
I can't sleep in here, man.
I'm scared.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.100
Look, there's nothing to be scared of.
It's a new house...

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.600
...there's a lot of creaks and moans
and groans in it.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.700
- Put on... You got your TV on?
- Well, yeah, I fell asleep with it on.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.700
- Turn on channel 42.
- Forty-two?

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.200
- Look at them buns.
- Well, that is a set of buns.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.200
And down, and down, and...

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.800
What's she doing exercising
at 2:30 in the morning?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.900
Oh, yeah, that's a really good point.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.500
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Do you remember that I hate you?

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.200
Hey, man, you know what
I was thinking?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.000
- You're lucky.
- I'm lucky?

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.100
- How so?
- Well, check it out.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.900
I'm sitting here in this enormous
haunted mansion, can't sleep.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.400
You're hanging out at your mom's.
That's awesome.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.400
- That's, like, the opposite of awesome.
- Well, this is like a hotel room...

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.300
...with someone else's junk in it.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.800
Okay, yeah, well, that someone else's
junk, that used to be my stuff.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.600
I'm just having a hard time, man.
I'm just calling up for some support.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.700
Do you...? Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.600
- Hey, one more thing.
- Yeah?

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.200
When you have the stereo on
at the same time as the TV...

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.400
...how do you control the volume
on the TV?

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.300
Why do you want to listen to the TV
with the stereo on?

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.300
Because I like to party.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.400
Why am I still talking to you?

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.400
Come on.
We were doing good there, man.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.700
I'm taking care of your house good.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.200
I keep snapping back into it.
It's like a trick you're pulling on me.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.500
- All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- All right, man. Talk to you tomorrow.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
Shit.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.399
Get out.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.399
Where did stock-car racing
come from?

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:36.600
What?

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.899
- Hey, stop doing that.
- How did stock-car racing get its start?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.800
Bootleggers in Prohibition had to have
cars fast enough to outrun the Feds...

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.700
...then they started racing each other.
- That's right.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.100
If I was right, why'd you throw
another bucket on me?

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:55.100
I filled up three. Now, there's nothing
like driving to avoid jail.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:58.899
Nothing hones your mind
and your instincts like necessity.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.399
So I taped a kilo of cocaine underneath
the car and called the boys in blue.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.399
Now, the way I figure it,
you got about two minutes...

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.100
...before they show up
and you do five to 10.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.100
So, what's it gonna be?
Fear or prison?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.600
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Real simple, son.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.899
Cops are coming.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:23.200
There's a kilo of Colombian bam-bam
under the car. Time to be a man.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.399
- You got hair on your peaches or what?
- You're not kidding, are you? Man.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.800
You crazy creep!

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.100
Come on, son.
What's it gonna be?

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.000
Speed or jail?

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.100
Grandpa, would you like
to take us fishing...

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.600
...and tell us life lessons and stories
about your childhood?

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.200
I got a better idea.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.200
Why don't you boys go dig a hole
and I'll get another beer?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:06.500
Someone didn't love you enough
when you were little, did they?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.500
Good call.
Here, that's worth a nickel.

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.800
Tragic.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.800
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch,
son of a bitch.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.200
Oh, man. Oh, man!

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.400
One-sixteen. One-sixteen!

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.100
I'm going fast again!

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.500
Pull over! Pull over!

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.500
Pull over?
I'll pull over for you. How about this?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Where are you?

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.000
Gotcha.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.300
"Feels good going fast, doesn't it?

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:56.400
By the way, don't try and snort
these Lucky Charms. Reese."

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.000
Okay.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.500
Okay.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.500
There you go, little man.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.800
Hey, Ricky!

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.400
How you doing?

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.400
- Oh, Nana, not my prison shank.
- In the can.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.200
There's your
mother-flipping driving test.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.300
Mr. Bobby, you are magnificent.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.200
Down, Karen! Get down!
Get down, Karen!

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.100
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.400
Well, son, you are looking good
behind that wheel.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.400
Thanks, Daddy. I gotta tell you,
I feel good. Heck, you know what?

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.400
Let's go out tonight, you know,
the whole family.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.800
I'm talking about sitting down,
enjoying a gourmet meal...

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.400
...at a place that's real special.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.800
- Hi. Those plates are hot. Enjoy.
- You got your own skillet.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.500
- Be back to check on you in a minute.
- Thank you.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.900
Oh, gooder than grits.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.500
Let us pray.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.200
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.400
...lying there
in your little ghost manger...

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.900
...just looking at your Baby Einstein
developmental videos...

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.200
...learning about shapes
and colors and...

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.800
We just have so much
to be thankful for.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.400
First off, my sons no longer act...

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.700
...like retarded gangbangers.
- Amen.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.500
Also, I got my balls back
behind the wheel of a car.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.700
And most importantly,
we thank you...

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.900
...for bringing back our nasty,
delinquent, pot-dealing daddy to us.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.100
For he was lost,
but now he is found. Amen.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.500
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.200
Son, that was lovely.

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.200
- What a lovely meal.
- It sure is.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
It certainly does look delicious.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.800
I gotta tell you, this is about
a damn perfect evening right now.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.600
It is, isn't it?

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.800
You know what we should do?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Every week, we should come back
to this Applebee's...

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.500
...and sit at this table,
and have a family meal.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.000
- That's a great idea, Mama.
- And order the same stuff.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:38.200
- That would be great.
- And I would be delighted, Reese...

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.400
...if you would accompany me to
ballroom dancing on Tuesday nights.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.500
- Tuesday night?
- It's a lot of fun.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.300
- I think you'd have a good time.
- How's everybody doing here?

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.500
- Dolly, it's so good.
- Oh, it's really, really good.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.100
You know, I just...
I hate to be a pain, darling...

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.600
...but I asked for no onions
on my Bourbon Steak.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.100
I am so sorry.
I thought you asked for onions...

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.200
Okay, okay,
maybe don't interrupt me.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.500
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
- Yeah, well, I think you did mean to...

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.600
...and I also think that you meant
to put the damn onions on my steak.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.800
- Okay, Reese.
- Grandfather...

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
...can't we resolve
this conflict without anger?

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:22.600
- I'm a veteran and a diabetic!
- Dad!

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.800
- Dad! Why are you doing this?
- Applebee's has rats!

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.200
I found a whole rat
in my Cobb salad!

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.700
Dad, where are you going?

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.200
Come on, frat boy, you wanna go?

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.700
- What's going on, man?
- Ricky, let him go!

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.400
- Things were going good, weren't they?
- That's exactly why I had to blow it up.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.500
I don't know what organ or bone
people have...

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.600
...that makes them act right,
but I was born without it. I'm no good.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.300
All those races I won,
that was for you, you know that?

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.200
I did just like you told me:
"If you ain't first, you're last."

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.100
What the hell are you talking about?

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.900
What you told me
that day at school for career day.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.400
You came in and you said,
"If you ain't first, you're last."

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.200
Oh, hell, Ricky,
I was high when I said that.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.100
That doesn't make any sense at all.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.300
"You're first or last." You can
be second, you can be third, fourth.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.300
Hell, you can even be fifth.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.000
What are you talking about?
I lived my whole life based on that.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.400
Well, now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.700
Well, that's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400
Good luck to you, son.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.900
Hey, Dad!

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.700
Where are you going?

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.600
Does it matter?

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.100
Here we go.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:20.400
Hey, don't bump me.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.000
Oh, man, I'm flying.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.500
Game over. Come on, reset.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.400
Boy, you are a terrible driver, no?

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.300
How'd you get on a video game
so fast?

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.200
Is your name, by chance,
Ricky Bobby?

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.500
Hey, screw you, man!
I got nothing because of you!

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.800
- I hate you!
- Hey, Ricky.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I am on fire. I am on fire.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.000
Susan?

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.100
And so then I got a marketing
job with NASCAR.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.300
- Really?
- Yeah, it's great. It's great.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.100
Well, gosh, you look fantastic.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.700
- Thank you.
- I mean, you've always looked good.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.500
I mean, I'm just... I'm happy for you.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.700
Thank you.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.600
But what about you?

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.800
How have you been?
What have you been doing?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.700
Well, they want me to race at Talladega
next weekend, but I'm not gonna do it.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.500
Because I'm done.
I'm done with the racing, with driving.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.600
- Why would you do that?
- Because I've really moved on.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.200
I've sent in my application to
The Real World...

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.800
...so I'm hoping to hear back.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.600
I'm putting a lot of my eggs into
that basket, the MTV basket.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.000
I'm also thinking about getting a gun
and dealing crack.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.000
Being a crack dealer, but not like
a mean crack dealer, but like a...

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.300
You know, like a nice one.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.600
Just kind of friendly, like, "Hey...

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.000
...what's up, guys?
You want some crack?"

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.500
I'm just waiting on those two things
to kind of flesh themselves out.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600
You know what, Ricky?

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.800
I have kept my mouth shut
for a really, really long time.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.500
And I just don't think that I can
keep it shut anymore.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.500
I just have to tell you that I think
you are making a big mistake.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.500
- Really?
- Yes.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.100
Why is it that you always fall
for people who leave you?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.200
Have you noticed that?

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.500
Like Carley and your dad
and your sponsors.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.300
And you always have
to prove yourself. Wh...?

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.600
Well, you gotta listen
to me here, okay?

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.600
You gotta win to get love.
Everyone knows that.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.400
I mean, that's just life.

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.500
Look at Don Shula,
legendary coach.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.000
Look at that Asian guy
who holds the world record...

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.100
...for eating all those hot dogs
in a row.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.000
Look at Rue McClanahan
from The Golden Girls.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:54.200
All three people,
all great champions, all loved.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.900
Do you wanna know why I think
that you should race again?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.200
Sure. Why?

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.400
Okay. It's because
it's what you love, Ricky.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.800
It is who you were born to be.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.400
And here you sit, thinking.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.500
Well, Ricky Bobby is not a thinker.
Ricky Bobby is a driver.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.100
He is a doer.
And that's what you need to do.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.200
You don't need to think,
you need to drive.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.200
You need speed. You need to go out
there, and you need to rev your engine.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.500
You need to fire it up.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.400
You need to grab hold of the line
between speed and chaos...

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.300
...and you need to wrestle it
to the ground like a demon cobra.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.300
And then, when that fear rises up
in your belly, you use it...

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.400
...and you know that fear is powerful
because it has been there...

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.500
...for billions of years! And it is good,
and you use it, and you ride it.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.600
You ride it like a skeleton horse
through the gates of hell...

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.400
...and then you win! You win!

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.300
You don't win for anybody else,
you win for you. You know why?

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:51.600
Because a man takes what he wants,
he takes it all.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.400
And you're a man, aren't you?
Aren't you?

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.400
Susan, I've never heard you
talk like that.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.800
Are we about to get it on?

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.800
Because I'm as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.600
- This is awesome.
- Yes, it is.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.700
- Are you climbing on the table now?
- Yes, sir.

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.600
I can't believe this.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:28.600
This is like that Whitesnake video
where the girl crawls on...

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.700
Yeah. Just like that.
What's her name?

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.000
Tawny Kitaen. She's really good.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
- She's great.
- She's fantastic.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.900
Everyone, turn away.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.100
Things are gonna get crazy.
We're gonna make animal noises.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.600
- Looks good, damn good.
- Yeah. That's good, guys.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.600
Yeah, Ricky, it's good to be back.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.400
- Talladega.
- Talladega.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600
I missed you dudes.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.100
Even you too, Glenn.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.900
I didn't have a whole lot of money left,
but what I did I put into the car.

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.000
We got some lower-end sponsors,
so it's nothing to shout about...

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.400
...but at least we got
something to run in.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.900
Let's see what we got, guys.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.500
What are we looking at?
"Julio's thongs for men"?

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.700
Come on, what kind of dude
wears a thong?

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.900
Yeah, that's messed up.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.500
Perverts, you know?

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.500
It's not the best car, but it'll move.

01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:01.500
Hold on, now, baby. Let's just see
what this thing's got under the hood.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.300
- There she is.
- Looks like the Pep Boys threw up.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.300
- Damn.
- Like I said, work in progress.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.100
All right, I tell you what we gotta do.
Since we got no corporate money...

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.200
...we have to build this
engine ourselves.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.400
I want you to hit up every independent
driver out there for spare parts.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.600
Yeah, Lucius, that's crazy.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.100
Well, crazy is all we got
right now, okay? So do it.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.400
Now, where you going?

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.000
I wanna tell Gerard Depardieu
we're coming for him.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.800
There you go, baby. Give him hell.

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:34.400
Get this engine built. Get it built.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.700
I have not finished.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.400
Monsieur Girard,
Ricky Bobby is here to see you.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.400
This is the one I was talking about,
Ricky Bobby.

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.200
Thank you, Bacco. Go.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.300
You're a tough man to find.
You know that, buster?

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.000
I prefer solitude
the day before a race.

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.200
I am being so incredibly rude,
Monsieur Bobby.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.800
Let me introduce you
to my lunch guests.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.400
This is my dear old friend
Elvis Costello.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:21.300
Delightful to meet you, Mr. Robert.
I thought you were dead.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:28.000
And next to him is hip-hop artist,
poet and my brother-in-law, Mos Def.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.900
I like your driving style.
I'm more of a Tony Stewart man...

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.600
...number 20 car, myself.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.800
How he gets into
those straightaways.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.500
Gets it in the paint. Get her done!

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.500
And across from Monsieur Def...

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.800
...is Breeze.

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.200
Hey. You're Breeze or you're Breeze?
Which one of you is Breeze?

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.800
Together we are Breeze.

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:51.800
They are like twins,
born from different wombs.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.700
- Right.
- They are God's most...

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.200
...beautiful mistake.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.000
They do everything together.
Everything.

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.500
They read the same books.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.600
They do Pilates together.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.000
They walk, talk, sleep...

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.200
...even go make toilet.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.300
Okay, you're starting
to creep me out, man.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.000
A single plop.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.800
One single plop.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.400
I don't need to hear about
doing a toilet.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.200
You want more examples?

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.400
- No, you listed like 8000.
- Less than that.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.500
- It's none of my business.
- More like...

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:30.500
...I don't know, between five and 10.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.600
Look, I need to talk to you.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.500
Walk with me, Ricky Bobby.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.000
- You have a good lunch.
- Take care, man.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.800
- Goodbye, Ricky.
- Goodbye.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.900
Holding hands with a man
makes me terribly uncomfortable.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.200
It is a sign of friendship
in many countries.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.100
Well, not in ours.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.900
There's nothing sexual about it.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.400
Please don't be worried at the fact
I have an erection.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:56.400
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Hey, come on.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.500
Look. Here's the deal.
I came here to tell you one thing.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.400
All right?
Tomorrow, I'm coming for you.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.500
Do you know why I came to America,
Ricky Bobby?

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.400
Public schools, health-care system,
giant water parks.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.700
I mean, the same reason
anyone comes to America.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.400
I came here for you to beat me.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
- What the hell are you talking about?
- My husband, Gregory, and I...

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.000
...wish only for that
which every other couple wishes for:

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.200
To tame Komodo dragons
in Sri Lanka...

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.500
...and teach them
to perform Hamlet.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.200
But before I can do that...

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.900
- That's dumb.
- It's not dumb.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.000
- It is dumb.
- Why is it dumb?

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.100
- I don't know.
- But before I can do that...

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.400
...I must be beaten by a driver
who's truly better than me.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:49.100
So you're gonna lose to me
on purpose?

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.000
- No.
- No?

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.400
No!

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.300
I will battle you with the entirety
of my heart.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.300
And you will probably lose.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:03.300
But maybe, just maybe...

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.300
...you might challenge me.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.000
God needs the devil.

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.200
The Beatles needed
the Rolling Stones.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.800
Even Diane Sawyer
needed Katie Couric.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.800
Will you be my Katie Couric?

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:23.500
I feel like I'm in Highlander.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.200
What's the Highlander?

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.500
It's a movie.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.600
- Any good?
- Very good.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.800
- It won the Academy Award.
- Oh, for what?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.600
For best movie ever made.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:39.000
I just want you to know I came here
today to tell you one thing.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.000
That come race time tomorrow,
I'm coming for you, all right?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.100
- May God be with you.
- Yeah.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.400
Because although
today I am friendly...

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.000
...tomorrow will be war!

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
All right.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.900
Ladies and gentlemen, pull up a chair,
drop the kids off with their aunt...

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.900
...and take the phone off the hook
because it's race day here...

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.300
...at the Talladega Superspeedway.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.500
Hey, guys.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.800
- Why so down?
- Ricky...

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.500
...we were up all night
working on the car.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800
And then something happened.
There was a fire.

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.500
Did you say "fire"?

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.100
Glenn is dead, Ricky.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.500
I mean,
he died last night in my arms...

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.200
...as I held him.
- Oh, man.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.000
He was so scared,
because you know how little he is.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.500
And death was coming for him,
and he stood there...

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.200
...and with a tear coming out his eyes,
he said, "Tell Ricky, win for me."

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.100
That's all that little bastard wanted,
was for you to win.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.500
I wish you could've seen him.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.400
I wish you could've felt
his little heart fluttering.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.900
Sweet Jesus.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.400
Poor Glenn.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.600
Hey, what the hell, man.
Hey, Glenn. Glenn!

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.300
- I see you.
- Glenn, what did I say?

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.100
- I said, "Wait till after the race."
- Was he crying?

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:18.700
I'm sorry, Ricky. We were just trying to
give you a little extra motivation.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.700
Well, that is just sick, guys.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.900
It's okay, Susie.
I appreciate it, guys.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.600
Just trying to help out...

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.500
...even though
it was weird and perverse.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.000
They're just trying to help, Ricky.
We're a team here.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.500
- I appreciate it.
- Let's see what's under the hood.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.700
All right, let's have a look.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:45.700
Hot dog. I mean, that's like looking up
Bridgette Wilson-Sampras' skirt.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.300
We were up all night working on it.
Like I said, a lot of teams gave parts.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.600
Nice work, guys.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.500
And your sponsors weren't doing
very much, so...

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500
...well, we repainted the car.

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.000
Well, take a look. Come on, guys.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.100
Well, I like the cougar,
but what company is "M.E."?

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.500
"Me" is you...

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.500
...because it's just you out there.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.600
We don't have
any corporate sponsors.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.800
We don't have
any fancy team owners.

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.600
We have you...

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.700
...and this car, and this cougar...

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.800
...which symbolizes the fear
that you have overcome.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.800
It's all there for you.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.400
Ricky, this car is like your Excalibur,
the mighty sword King Arthur used...

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.000
...to bring together
the Knights of the Round Table...

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.900
...until Lancelot betrayed him by laying
with his queen, in the biblical sense.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.700
Okay, Glenn.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Everything cool that Susan said,
you wrecked it.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.900
Guys, let's go win ourselves
a race, all right?

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.200
- There you go. Yeah!
- Right?

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.700
Let's get out there and win a race.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:07.400
From Provence, France...

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.200
...driver of the number 55
Perrier car...

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.500
...Jean Girard.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.400
From West River, North Carolina...

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.700
...driver of the number 47
Old Spice car...

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.200
...Cal Naughton Jr.

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.100
Hey, Carley.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.800
- Hey, Ricky.
- Carley! Hey, baby.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.400
Baby.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.400
Oh, hey, Ricky.

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.400
Hey, man.
We missed you at the wedding.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.400
- You missed me at the wedding?
- Oh, man, it was so classy.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.100
We had a Styx cover band
and a nacho fountain.

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:04.300
Check it, it was a nacho fountain
with six kinds of cheese on it.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.600
- Liquid cheese? It cascaded down?
- Yeah.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.000
- Are you serious?
- Amazing. Six different kinds.

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.600
Swiss, Havarti.
What was the other one?

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.000
- Gouda.
- Cheddar, Gouda.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.100
That's the greatest thing
I ever heard of.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.200
Bean buffet in front of it.
It was awesome.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.600
Don't listen to him. And remember
one thing, he's the competition.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.600
You're not very focused right now.
I need you to focus.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.300
- Hey.
- What?

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.600
- I'm the Magic Man now. Okay?
- Yeah, I know.

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.800
So get ready for some tricks up
these sleeves, all right?

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.400
Watch your buns, pal.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.400
Baby, that is real good talk.
Like we practiced last night.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.900
I got something to tell you,
you mangy piece of trash.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.700
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:46.400
I took you for granted, Cal, and you
were a really good friend to me...

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.800
...and I never gave you your due.
It was my fault.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.400
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm a little confused by your tactics.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.500
- Tactics?
- Yeah. I'm gonna keep acting tough...

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.700
...until I figure it out. All right?

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.200
See you on the track.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.700
- Come on, baby.
- I love you.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.500
I love you too. Come on.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.700
Abracadabra, homes.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:15.500
Hi, Bill Weber, along with
Wally Dallenbach and Benny Parsons.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.500
Thanks for having us. Today,
Talladega, NASCAR's biggest track...

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.500
...where the big concern
is the big wreck.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.700
And it's not if it happens,
it's where and when.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.100
We have a guy in the race today
that'll probably cause it, Ricky Bobby.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400
Starting in the rear of the field,
underfunded...

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.100
...and the last time we saw him,
he caused a big crash.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.700
A lot of big stories and some
big questions here at Talladega.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.700
All right, go get them.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.700
You must decide, Ricky Bobby.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.600
Is it foolish pride,
or is it greatness for you?

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.500
- Hey, Jarvis!
- Go ahead, Cal.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.900
If you slept with
your best friend's wife...

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.700
...why would he apologize to you?
- Yeah, I know. That's weird.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.600
That's what I'm saying.
My head's all tied up like a pretzel.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.400
I got a pretzel in my head.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.700
- Ricky!
- Come on, Dad!

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.500
I've got some big investors
coming by.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600
These guys are
big-money power players.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.000
If things go right, they could have us
owning half the cars in NASCAR.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.000
So I want you...
No, I want you to behave.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.500
- Oh, really?
- Quiet.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.900
Should I not tell them
after 14 years of marriage...

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:23.200
...you're still afraid
to let me see you naked?

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.400
That's not a fear thing,
it's a trust thing.

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.800
Hey! I was wondering
where you guys got off to.

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.200
Baby, this is Ted Beamen
from Halliburton.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.500
- Nice to meet you.
- Over here...

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.500
...is Dick Tangfield
from Dynacorp.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.500
- Back there is...
- You have beautiful teeth.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.600
Yes, he does.
Get yourselves down there.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.400
- Adorable.
- Make yourselves at home...

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.000
...grab something to eat, over here...
- Sweetheart, sweetheart.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.600
You're a sweetie pie.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.500
She's very affectionate.
She suffered a recent loss...

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.100
You taste good too.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.200
- So she's a little emotional.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.400
Okay, that's fine. Go ahead, find a seat.
Can we get these guys something?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.100
Jean Girard started from the pole
and is out to a big lead.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.600
As you know, Bill,
he's been doing that all year.

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:11.700
Where are you, Ricky Bobby?
Come face your destroyer!

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.500
"Come face your destroyer"?
Listen to how I sound.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.400
I sound like a massive prick.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.200
Come on, baby! Yeah, that's it.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.300
All right, Lucius.
Time to let the cougar loose.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.400
Here we go, boys.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.600
Ricky Bobby, in the 62 car,
on the move.

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.000
He's gone from 26th to 18th place.

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.800
Now let's go to John Hannafin, in the
stands with a country-music legend.

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:47.300
Thank you, Sean. I'm here with one
of the greatest country-music stars...

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.200
...of all time, Kenny Rogers.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:53.400
- What do you think of the race so far?
- It's good. They're going really fast.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.600
John, that's not Kenny Rogers.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.400
In the song "The Gambler,"
you sang:

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.600
"You gotta know when to walk away
and know when to run."

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.400
Should Ricky Bobby have
stayed away from racing?

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.600
Mr. Bobby's very competitive.
If he wants to race, he should race.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.800
Well, this is John Hannafin with Kenny
Rogers. And now back to you, Bill.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.900
Well, that, of course,
was not Kenny Rogers.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.100
Not even close.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.300
Ricky, you've got Brian Wavecrest...

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.900
...the guy that replaced you
at Dennit, dead ahead.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.800
Bobby working really hard to pass
the Wonder Bread car.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.800
That's his old ride, of course.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.700
We've passed the halfway mark
with Ricky Bobby...

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
...now three car lengths
behind the leader.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.400
Maybe subconsciously
you slept with Ricky's wife...

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.300
...as a way of getting back at him...

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.300
...for making you
come in second all those years.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:52.600
I know one thing, Carley was definitely
unconscious every time we had sex.

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.600
Lucius, I got Cal Naughton
dead ahead of me.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.600
Hey, Cal, you should pay attention.
I think he's passing you.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.000
Is Ricky passing me
in my subconscious?

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.100
No, he's actually passing you.
That's happening right now.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.800
Go, Ricky! Go!

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.500
Let's go back to our
John Hannafin...

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.300
...who's in the stands
with an NBA legend, Larry Bird.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.900
Folks, I'm here with one of the great
NBA superstars...

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.800
...a real legend, Larry Bird.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.200
I almost didn't recognize you with
the sunglasses. What are you up to?

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.000
Come on, John, pay attention.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.400
I'm concerned.
He might have had a stroke.

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.100
Didn't Ricky Bobby used to
drive for you?

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.300
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- He's doing quite well.

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Richard!

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.700
Get Cal Naughton's crew chief
on the radio right away.

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.500
I believe you have some tickets waiting
for me. My name's Reese Bobby.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.400
Reese Bobby.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.500
Mister, these tickets have been waiting
for you for a long time.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.800
Who needs two? I got tickets!

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.200
Tickets, right here, 60 bucks a pop.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.500
All right, Girard, I found you.
Now let's see where this goes.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.600
Bobby's gotten around Naughton...

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.300
...and now he's right behind Girard,
but Girard's gonna block the track.

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.600
Man, he's scary good.

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.800
Ah, Ricky Bobby.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.500
Now we shall dance,
and yes, it will be a slow jam.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.200
Damn it. Come on, man.

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:44.600
I was wrong about you, Ricky Bobby.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.100
You are not the one to defeat me.

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.300
I can't get around him, man.

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.900
You tell Cal Naughton
to take Ricky Bobby out.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:03.200
Hey, Cal, listen. I hate to add
to your tremendous moral confusion...

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.700
...but I just heard from Dennit.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
He said to take Ricky Bobby
out of the race or you're fired, buddy.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.600
What are you talking about?

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.400
Tell him if he doesn't do it, he's done.
That's right, he'll be driving a tour bus.

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:18.200
Well, you tell Mr. Dennit that
Ricky Bobby is my best friend.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.200
- And it's Shake and Bake time.
- Cal, I don't like the way...

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.800
...you're talking out there.
- Damn the torpedoes!

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Come on, man, slingshot it.
Slingshot, come on.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.400
I can't believe it.
If it isn't Mike Honcho himself.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.100
Shake and Bake, buddy!

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.200
Shake it before you bake it.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:48.600
Here I come. Slingshot engaged.

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.400
Yeah!

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.600
I love you, Cal!

01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.600
- What are you doing?
- Can't believe it. Now I've seen it all.

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:03.600
Cal Naughton from Dennit Racing just
helped a rival driver pass a teammate.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.900
Darrell, you tell Brian Wavecrest
to take out Cal Naughton right now.

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.400
Right now, you do it. You do it!

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.400
Yes, sir.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.200
And the 26 car just ran Naughton
into the wall.

01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:32.700
Oh, man.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.600
Damn you, Wavecrest!

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.200
The entire field was in that wreck,
and we've only got six laps to go.

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.500
Only Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard
got away clean.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.500
It's just Jean and Ricky.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.500
And now the matador shall dance
with the blind shoemaker.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.600
Race officials have completed
an extensive cleanup of the track.

01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.500
We're ready to get back to racing.

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:16.000
The 200,000 fans are on their feet,
and the green flag is in the air.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.800
Bobby and Girard are
dueling each other for the lead.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.400
No one seems to have the edge.

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:32.600
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go!

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the final lap.

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.500
By the way, Ricky,
I watched the Highlander movie.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.200
It was shit.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.400
Hang on, baby Jesus,
this is gonna get bumpy.

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.300
I've seen a lot of big crashes
at Talladega...

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.400
...but this is the longest one
I've ever seen.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.400
Let's take a quick commercial break
and we'll be right back.

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.500
Hungry for both steak and shrimp?

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.200
Welcome back to Talladega,
where the long one continues.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.500
No, no! Jean Girard and Ricky Bobby
have wrecked in the last lap...

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.500
...on the straightaway.
What a shame.

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.500
Oh, God.

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:56.500
It looks like neither Girard or Bobby
will finish this race.

01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.800
We'd like to thank you for joining us
for NBC's coverage of NAS CAR.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Coming up next,
it's Ice Dancing to the Hits of Motown.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.400
Wait a minute, there's something
going on on the track down there.

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.900
Oh, my God,
they're racing each other on foot.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.400
These men will not quit.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.800
Go! Go!

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.100
Ricky, Ricky. He's going,
he's going, he's going. Look!

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.400
He did it!

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.100
Well, I'll be damned.

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.500
Good for you, Ricky Bobby.

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.600
Yeah! Yeah!

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.200
Ricky Bobby wins!

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.900
You'll never see anything like that
in a hundred lifetimes.

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.700
It was completely illegal and in no way
will count, but that was something.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.400
It was. That was really good.

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.600
Monsieur Bobby,
by defeating me today...

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.200
...you have set me free.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.800
And for that, I thank you.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.400
I will never shake your hand, ever.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.500
But I will give you this.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.600
Sir, you taste of America.

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.800
Thank you.

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.900
No, once was good. Once was good.

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.300
Boy, that Halliburton.
Halliburton's taken off, haven't they?

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.800
Yeah, yeah, we're doing well.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.700
Now there's some stock
I'd like to get my hands on.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
NASCAR fans...

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.700
...your eyes on Talladega's
famed Victory Lane...

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.800
...as we get ready
for trophy time here...

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.200
...following an exciting running
of the Talladega 500.

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.600
First, a very brief explanation.

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.400
Because the drivers that finished
first and second got out of their cars...

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.000
...they have officially
been disqualified.

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.900
So now the winner, he was third,
he's now number one:

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.000
Cal Naughton Jr.!

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.800
Yeah, come on, guys!

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.500
- Give me that thing.
- Cal, you're number one!

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.200
I've been waiting a long time for you
to say my name, man.

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.400
I know it's a technicality,
but I tell you what...

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.900
...you try to take this away from me,
I'll sock you in the face.

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.900
Ricky.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.800
Give me that thing.

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:53.800
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.400
- Cal!
- Put me down.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.200
I'm proud of you!

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.900
Get up here, man.
No, you come up here.

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.400
You come up here.

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.100
- Cal Naughton! Cal Naughton.
- Oh, my God.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.200
For this to happen...
Am I dead, man?

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.600
You won the Talladega 500,
all right?

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.600
I owe you an apology.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.500
- Come on.
- Man, I'm sorry about Carley.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.600
She walked straight up to me
and grabbed me in the crotch.

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:28.400
- It's like a tractor beam of hotness.
- I know.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.600
Shake and Bake?

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.200
No. Never again.

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.200
You're right.
I was a total dick, man.

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.700
From now on...

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.200
...it's Magic Man...

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.800
...and El Diablo.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.500
What's "Diablo" mean?

01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:54.000
It's like, you know...

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.400
It's like Spanish for,
like, a fighting chicken.

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.000
- That's awesome.
- I know.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.300
- With the claws.
- With the claws and the beak.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:02.800
Where did you think of that?

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:04.600
You just... Sometimes things click.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.700
- I love you, bro.
- I love you too.

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.200
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.500
Excuse me, guys. Nice job.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.000
Hey, Ricky.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.700
Hey, Carley.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.600
I've decided I can love you again.
You're a winner.

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.500
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Really?

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.600
Are you prepared to walk away
from these pearls...

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.200
...of delight?

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.300
Well... Yeah, this is tough.
How would it work?

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.200
- Would Cal move out?
- Yep, gone.

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.400
Kids move back in?

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:50.800
- Can I just have a little refresher?
- Of course, baby.

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.400
This is why you fell in love,
don't forget.

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.800
Yeah, I'm in.
I'm moving in right now.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.900
I'll drive 100 miles an hour
to your house.

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.800
- Our house. Our house.
- Our house, yeah.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.400
No, I'm not. Come on.
It's gonna be awkward.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.100
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:09.000
Wait a minute.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:12.500
You are ready to walk away...

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.300
...from FHM magazine's
number seven hottest ass...

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.300
...for the girl who forgets
to get your dry cleaning?

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:24.800
- Yeah.
- Good luck, weirdoes.

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.800
- Carley, come back here.
- Yes, Susie Q?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
There's something I've wanted
to tell you for a really long time.

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:34.500
Thank you. Maybe one together?

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.400
- Susie Q, are those real?
- Yeah.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.500
Well, girl, you got some game.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.400
- We'll see you on down the road.
- Yeah.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:47.400
- You seen Cal?
- He's somewhere around here.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.500
Hey, Cal! Baby, I'm coming.
Thanks, baby.

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:54.200
- Maybe one more?
- Oh, boys.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.800
- She's crazy.
- Oh, thank you.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.600
- You did good.
- Thanks, Mama.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.400
He's amazing.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.500
That was one heck of a day,
I gotta say.

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.500
That's some nice driving there,
cowboy.

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.500
- Hey, Daddy.
- Well, hello, Reese.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:12.400
Well, if it isn't our old
mangy, transient grandfather.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:15.500
Well said, grandson.
Take that as a compliment.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.700
Hey, Ricky,
let me ask you a question.

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.500
Who did you win that race for?

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.700
Well, I sure as hell didn't
win it for you.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.800
I like hearing that.

01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:31.500
I guess if I really gotta think about it...

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:34.500
...I just went out there and drove.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.000
And knew that no matter
what happened...

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:43.200
...my boys, my mama,
and my lady would love me.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:47.500
Hi, I'm his lady, I'm Susan.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.400
I painted the car, I...
We had sex.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.400
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.600
Well, I wish I could've
been there for that.

01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.400
Son, I'm proud of you.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.300
Yep. Yeah, I think...
I guess things are...

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.400
...just pretty much perfect right now.

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.500
It's making me a little itchy.

01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:15.400
Well, what do you say
we get thrown out of an Applebee's?

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:18.100
- That sound like a good idea?
- You read my mind, son.

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.800
- You can cuss at Applebee's.
- Everybody pile in.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.800
How does one get thrown out
of Applebee's?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.400
- You're about to find out.
- Okay.

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.600
Watch, the doors actually open.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.400
- Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
- And I'm Cal Naughton Jr.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:05.000
We just want to take a moment to talk
to you about snow blindness in cats.

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.400
It's affecting more and more cats
every year.

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.300
And it scares the living shit out of us.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:14.400
Ninety-eight percent of us will die
at some point in our lives.

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.500
The darkness is creeping towards you,
whether you know it or not.

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.200
A little planning can go a long way.

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.400
Listen, leaving
your big old corpse behind...

01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.600
...for your loved ones to deal with
ain't cool.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.300
That's why you should call
McCreedy Funeral Service.

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:30.300
McCreedy's.
They'll find the hole and build the box.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.800
Bodies that look so good,
you're gonna wanna talk to it.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.600
We like to have a lot of laughs
on the racetrack...

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.200
...but today we wanna talk
about something serious:

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.400
Packs of stray dogs that control
most of the major cities.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:52.600
That's packs of wild, vicious dogs
that are controlling most of...

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.600
Sorry.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.200
I like to picture Jesus
like a mischievous badger.

01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.500
Like a muscular trapeze artist.

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:03.100
Like a shapeshifter or a changeling,
like that guy.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:04.900
You ever hear of
that TV show Manimal?

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:08.200
I like to think of Jesus
as a figure skater...

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.100
...who wears, like, a white outfit...

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.700
...and he does interpretive ice dances
of my life's journey.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.900
Like a dirty old bum.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.400
He comes up to me, I'm about to sock
him one because he's a dirty old bum.

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:22.000
Then I said, "Wait a minute,
I better not sock this guy.

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.600
Something special about him."

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.000
- Yeah, and it turns out it's Jesus.
- Yeah.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.400
One, two... Oh, God.

01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:32.100
- Not again! No go. No go!
- It's stuck. It's stuck.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.200
We got two knives in my leg.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.700
I know, but one is a safety knife.
One is a safety.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.600
It's coming out.
It's coming out.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.100
I'm choking on my own spit.

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.800
It hurts so bad
I'm choking on my own spit.

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.400
Good night, guys.
I'm losing a lot of blood.

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.400
- Just relax, man.
- Good night.

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.300
Ricky! Wake...

01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:59.900
Sometimes, when it's late at night,
I dress up like Donna Summers.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.700
You know, I put on the skirt
and the four-inch heels, man.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.400
I love it.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.900
Sorry. Sorry.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.800
I would be honored if you would
let me sign your cast.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.400
And I would be honored
if you'd sign my balls.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:28.200
- Oh, baby, that is a good one.
- Hey, what are you doing?

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.000
"Don't touch a one of them.
They're mine."

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.500
So, what do you think
that story was about?

02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.500
Doesn't the bear symbolize
the old South...

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.800
...and the new dog, the encroaching
industrialization of the North?

02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:07.000
Duh. But the question is, should
the reader feel relief or sadness...

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.800
...at the passing of the old South?

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.600
Well, how about both?

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:13.800
Oh, I get it. Moral ambiguity.

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:18.500
The hallmark of all early
20th-century American fiction.

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:21.600
- Great analysis, Walker.
- Thank you.
