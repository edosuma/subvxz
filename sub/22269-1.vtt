WEBVTT

00:05.214 --> 00:08.508
<i>Darkness has come
to the Land of Wendimoor.</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:12.679
<i>An evil wizard called The Mage
has risen,</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.890
<i>his great army destroying
everything in its path.</i>

00:15.891 --> 00:18.977
<i>Now he marches on to
the Valley of Inglenook,</i>

00:18.978 --> 00:22.523
<i>where a war
between two families rages.</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.275
Come back here!

00:25.276 --> 00:26.693
There's nowhere left to run!

00:26.694 --> 00:27.861
You coward!

00:27.862 --> 00:28.737
You'll never get away!

00:28.738 --> 00:30.656
We've got you now!

00:32.074 --> 00:33.576
Get back here!

00:39.540 --> 00:41.750
You'll pay for what you did
to our family!

00:41.751 --> 00:43.585
End of the road!

00:43.586 --> 00:45.588
You can't run
anymore, Trost!

00:46.130 --> 00:47.714
My friends,

00:47.715 --> 00:49.049
you misunderstand.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.592
I was running to protect you.

00:56.849 --> 00:57.766
Come on.

01:05.608 --> 01:06.608
Had enough?

01:16.869 --> 01:18.454
Panto Trost!

01:19.455 --> 01:21.247
Halt where you stand.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.832
Kill him, Silas!

01:22.833 --> 01:24.834
Yeah, have Wygar
smash him to bits!

01:24.835 --> 01:26.127
Scramola, deadbeats!

01:29.090 --> 01:30.340
My family did not take

01:30.341 --> 01:31.716
your brother Farson, Silas.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.010
You must believe me.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.853
Of course I believe you,
my love.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.023
Come back,
speak to my mother.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.068
Together we could convince
our families to end this war

01:50.069 --> 01:51.402
before The Mage's armies arrive.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.738
The prophecy
is the only answer.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.159
Silas, they're coming.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.204
If you believe, then go.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.205
Now.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.457
Stay safe, my love.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.251
Save our world.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.419
Fulfill the prophecy!

02:08.420 --> 02:10.213
Find him!

02:10.214 --> 02:12.967
Find Dirk Gently!

02:35.489 --> 02:38.158
<i>Awake. Awake. Awake.</i>

02:38.159 --> 02:40.493
<i>Awake. Awake.</i>

02:40.494 --> 02:41.995
<i>You are awake.</i>

02:41.996 --> 02:45.832
<i>Prepare for testing, Project Icarus.</i>

02:45.833 --> 02:47.750
<i>Day 63.</i>

02:49.503 --> 02:52.338
<i>Focus,
predict the correct image.</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:53.381
I'm not psychic.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.092
This won't work.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.304
<i>Wrong.</i>

02:59.388 --> 03:00.389
<i>Wrong.</i>

03:03.559 --> 03:04.642
<i>Predict the number.</i>

03:04.643 --> 03:05.644
One.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.439
<i>Four.</i>

03:13.277 --> 03:14.695
<i>Disarm the device.</i>

03:22.077 --> 03:25.163
This isn't how this works.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.498
I'm not psychic.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.171
Yes, you are.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.130
No, I'm not.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.423
Yes, you are.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.051
Look, saying it quick
doesn't make it true somehow--

03:38.052 --> 03:39.136
Wait...

03:40.387 --> 03:42.556
Who is that?
Is that not the recording?

03:43.933 --> 03:45.808
How many of these tests have we done?

03:45.809 --> 03:46.893
So far...

03:46.894 --> 03:48.853
197, sir.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.319
Could you...

03:56.320 --> 03:57.987
try harder?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.657
"Try harder."

04:00.616 --> 04:02.034
<i>What's changed?</i>

04:02.868 --> 04:04.828
<i>Why are you talking to me now?</i>

04:05.204 --> 04:08.081
I've been in here for two months,

04:08.082 --> 04:09.791
and surprise!

04:09.792 --> 04:11.459
Nothing works.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.585
Dead end.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.588
<i>They did this to me when I was a child</i>

04:15.589 --> 04:16.881
<i>for years,</i>

04:16.882 --> 04:18.800
<i>and it went nowhere.</i>

04:18.801 --> 04:21.594
Look, cases come to me.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.221
I don't find them.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.390
That's what being a holistic detective is.

04:25.391 --> 04:28.602
I'm not designed to solve your problems.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.069
What have you done
to my friends?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.654
We're gonna get 'em.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.738
So you haven't got them?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.282
D-- No! I mean--

04:43.909 --> 04:45.326
They ran away, man.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.870
They-they-
they ran away, and they left you,

04:47.871 --> 04:49.205
<i>and you're alone here.</i>

04:49.206 --> 04:50.540
No one's coming, so just...

04:50.541 --> 04:52.875
try harder.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.354
It's kind of peaceful here.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.482
Especially when you've been
on the run for two months.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.823
We used to play
towns like this on tour.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.870
Honestly, it's a lot safer out here
than in the cities.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.498
I still don't see why I can't
tell my parents I'm okay.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.251
Their lines are definitely bugged.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.419
Blackwing would be listening.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.088
It's too dangerous.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.631
And meeting
with your brother isn't?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.133
That was just a matter of time.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.553
Using his log-ins
to access CIA networks?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.847
He was bound to notice.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.057
<i>Todd, we--</i>

05:49.058 --> 05:51.142
I know those other leads
have all been dead ends,

05:51.143 --> 05:53.186
but this next one is gonna be--

05:53.187 --> 05:54.354
That's what
you've said every time.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.230
This is the last time.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.399
We find Blackwing,
we find Dirk.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.901
We find Dirk,
we find Amanda,

05:59.902 --> 06:01.361
and we get
out of this mess.

06:01.362 --> 06:04.155
Yeah, how do we
do that exactly?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.617
It'll be like a...
holistic thing.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.662
Wherever this next lead
is taking us,

06:11.663 --> 06:14.040
there'll be
some kind of connection.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.625
Somewhere, right now,

06:15.626 --> 06:17.543
Dirk is waiting for us
to find him,

06:17.544 --> 06:19.212
and he'll know how to fix this.

06:20.756 --> 06:21.757
<i>Wrong.</i>

06:22.758 --> 06:23.633
<i>Wrong.</i>

06:25.260 --> 06:26.135
This is your--

06:27.054 --> 06:28.429
I am--

06:28.430 --> 06:29.431
<i>Wrong!</i>

06:30.599 --> 06:33.351
<i>This concludes today's testing.</i>

06:33.352 --> 06:36.188
<i>You have done a very bad job.</i>

06:37.606 --> 06:40.192
I'm never getting out of here.

06:51.453 --> 06:55.164
What'd you see in your
wacky shit brain this time, boss?

06:55.165 --> 06:56.541
I don't know...

06:56.542 --> 06:59.502
I don't know,
they're always so muddled.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.920
The visions keep
getting shorter,

07:00.921 --> 07:03.256
and, like, more vague.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.966
It's just...

07:04.967 --> 07:07.093
It's like poetry.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.137
You know, like...

07:09.138 --> 07:11.806
symbolism and shit.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.308
Do you see the guys in
the poetry this time, though?

07:14.309 --> 07:15.477
Do you know where they are?

07:17.146 --> 07:18.896
South.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.357
We have to keep going south.

07:21.358 --> 07:25.445
We're going to find them,
okay, Vogle?

07:25.446 --> 07:28.448
We'll get back together, and...

07:28.449 --> 07:31.868
we won't have to be on the run
anymore, I promise.

07:31.869 --> 07:32.910
<i>Hey!</i>

07:32.911 --> 07:34.287
Is someone there? Who is that?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.539
This is private property!

07:36.540 --> 07:37.874
Come down from there,
or I'm calling the police.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.250
You don't wanna
come over here, dude.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.334
It's the Rowdy Three.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.335
But there's only two of you.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.255
Oh, shut up, Math!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.299
Yeah!

07:46.675 --> 07:48.468
This is where he said to meet.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.721
Is that... what is that?

07:58.353 --> 07:59.854
Are you sure this isn't a trap?

07:59.855 --> 08:01.063
You're sure we can trust him?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.064
He's my brother.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.317
So... that means...?

08:04.318 --> 08:06.152
I don't know. Yes?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.488
I hope so.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.823
Don't let him get to you, okay?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.576
We're too close now.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.352
The famous Bergsberg boat.

08:39.353 --> 08:42.271
The Infant Male Pollock Francis?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.273
Yep.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.860
You know they say this thing's
been here since the '50s?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.153
Nobody's sure who left it here,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.364
but no one's taken the time to tow it away.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.406
Is this a trap?

08:52.407 --> 08:53.783
If it were a trap,

08:53.784 --> 08:54.992
it'd be pretty
embarrassing for you

08:54.993 --> 08:56.078
to have walked right into it.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.955
Man, I never thought
you'd be the one

08:58.956 --> 09:00.831
to end up on
the Most Wanted List, Farah.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.125
<i>The FBI, the CIA, the NSA,</i>

09:03.126 --> 09:05.253
hell, even my department
at Homeland Security

09:05.254 --> 09:07.296
have you and the Brotzmans
on its radar.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.424
Yeah, and I bet it only says
"person of interest," right?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.676
Blackwing.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.844
This is part of
the cover-up, Eddie.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.805
Yeah, I read about that
in the email you sent.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.890
Now, was this before or after

09:17.891 --> 09:20.309
you saved Lydia Spring
from being turned into a dog--

09:20.310 --> 09:21.727
Okay, she wasn't turned into a dog,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.063
her soul was put inside a dog,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.856
and actually,
it was quite stressful for me,

09:25.857 --> 09:27.317
so you don't need to do all that.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.158
Shit.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.336
Shit-- Farah!

09:48.338 --> 09:49.840
Shit...

09:50.882 --> 09:52.091
You hacked my account.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.260
It was the only way
to find information on Dirk.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.637
You think I give a damn about
this Dirk Gently person?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.974
This has gone on long enough.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.018
Come in.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.311
I can protect you.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.358
Take this.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.152
Is it a tracking device?

10:11.153 --> 10:12.529
It's a phone.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.783
When you're ready to give up
this insanity, call me.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.037
You've always had... problems,

10:20.871 --> 10:22.998
but now they've gotten you in too deep.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.253
Dad's dead.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.674
He went back into the hospital again

10:33.675 --> 10:35.509
about a month ago, and...

10:35.510 --> 10:37.011
he never came back out.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.347
I would've contacted you,
but I didn't know how.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.766
You were too good at hiding.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.853
Look, I know you feel
you failed him with...

10:45.854 --> 10:47.230
<i>everything.</i>

10:48.815 --> 10:52.069
It's not too late
to leave Todd Brotzman.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.659
<i>Step out of the car, please.</i>

11:21.348 --> 11:22.891
You look cool.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.019
O...kay.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.021
But you can't park here.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.606
State road.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.024
If you park here, I gotta tow you,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.234
which is to say,

11:33.235 --> 11:34.944
I am the tow truck driver
here in the county,

11:34.945 --> 11:36.363
along with being the Sheriff.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.489
Although I suppose now that I've told you,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.866
by the time I went and got the dang tow truck,
came back here to tow you,

11:40.867 --> 11:41.742
you'd already have moved it,
wouldn't you?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.411
Shoot, I would.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.830
Which would be an exercise
in pointlessness,

11:45.831 --> 11:48.124
unless I then proceeded
to chase you down,

11:48.125 --> 11:49.083
which would be thrilling, maybe--

11:50.544 --> 11:51.460
But let's be honest,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.838
there ain't gonna be any high-speed pursuit
of anything around here,

11:53.839 --> 11:57.508
other than my high-speed pursuit
of a good conversation!

11:57.509 --> 11:59.635
Hey, I get that from my brother,
he lives in Omaha.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.721
The guy loves two things
in this world, knitting

12:01.722 --> 12:03.556
and psychoanalysis,

12:03.557 --> 12:05.099
amateur psychoanalysis,
obviously, but also--

12:05.100 --> 12:06.642
Oh, God!

12:06.643 --> 12:07.769
No... No, not now.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.816
Oh!

12:13.817 --> 12:15.276
Oh, Jeezie Pete, man!

12:15.277 --> 12:16.945
What is happening to you,
and how can I help?

12:21.199 --> 12:22.075
What can I do to help?

12:23.493 --> 12:25.161
Uh, d-do you need...

12:25.162 --> 12:26.162
Todd! You're okay!

12:26.163 --> 12:27.079
Oh, hello--

12:27.080 --> 12:28.247
You're just having an attack.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.583
Ma'am, can I call, uh...

12:30.584 --> 12:32.251
Would you like me to call
an ambulance for you?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.919
No, everything is good with us, okay?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.212
Goodbye.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.589
Are you-- Okay, uh...

12:37.841 --> 12:40.134
Ma'am? Are you sure
I can't call an ambulance for you?

12:43.472 --> 12:44.680
That one's on me!

12:44.681 --> 12:46.016
I handled that badly!

12:55.567 --> 12:57.443
Yeah...

12:57.444 --> 13:00.572
that was extremely suspicious.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.547
<i>Scott!</i>

13:18.548 --> 13:19.840
Scotty!
Scotty, stop it!

13:19.841 --> 13:21.218
Scotty, stop it!

13:21.593 --> 13:23.093
- Scott!
- Where...

13:23.094 --> 13:24.178
are my...

13:24.179 --> 13:25.679
tickets, Mom?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.140
I'm gonna get you
your tickets, Scott--

13:28.141 --> 13:30.476
You said you'd get me
tickets to Sound of Nothing,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.102
and then you went and got groceries!

13:32.103 --> 13:33.896
Well, we need groceries, hon'.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.731
You need to eat healthier,
you can't just have fast food--

13:35.732 --> 13:38.776
Don't tell me what I need to eat!

13:38.777 --> 13:39.693
Are you a nutritionist?

13:39.694 --> 13:41.070
No...

13:41.071 --> 13:42.822
- Are you a nutritionist?
- All right, that's it!

13:42.823 --> 13:44.114
Mister!

13:44.115 --> 13:45.324
You're grounded.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.534
Your phone privileges

13:46.535 --> 13:47.701
are revoked.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.912
Hand it over.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.044
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Mom!

13:56.670 --> 13:57.878
I'm gonna get that back,

13:57.879 --> 14:00.673
and you are gonna get me those tickets!

14:00.674 --> 14:04.051
Yeah?
Well, we'll see about that, Bucko!

14:04.052 --> 14:05.553
Because I am the boss here,

14:05.554 --> 14:07.972
and I make the rules, and I decide what--

14:07.973 --> 14:09.349
No, don't lock it.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.565
Bob?

14:18.608 --> 14:20.568
Quiet, I'm sleeping.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.778

15:32.891 --> 15:35.100
What did I tell you about
goofing off on your phone at work?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.894
It's my son's phone.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.021
Don't tell me you're getting
your attitude back.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.314
You know, that accident

15:40.315 --> 15:41.691
was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.818
No, no, no, no, don't get sensitive.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.320
I need you focused.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.863
We need to get all the paperwork

15:47.864 --> 15:49.323
and safety sign-offs done.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.574
The clock's ticking.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.868
We already got 3,000 pounds
of dynamite down there,

15:52.869 --> 15:54.203
just gathering dust--

15:54.204 --> 15:55.245
I'm on it.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.330
I got it.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.414
A-okay.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.917
"A-okay."

16:11.471 --> 16:13.973
That was too close.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.140
If that cop calls in a description,

16:15.141 --> 16:16.892
we could be in serious trouble.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.852
I don't think he will.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.229
He seemed...

16:20.230 --> 16:21.439
insane.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.525
I'm feeling better,
we should get going.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.152
In broad daylight?

16:27.153 --> 16:30.948
Todd, if this is a high-security
government facility--

16:30.949 --> 16:32.199
You can handle it.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.035
I am not an army, Todd.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.579
I'm not... James Bond.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.082
Aren't you, though? Kinda?

16:40.083 --> 16:41.667
Okay, you just had

16:41.668 --> 16:44.336
a pararibulitus attack
in front of a police officer.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.295
There's--

16:45.296 --> 16:47.006
Things aren't going--

16:47.007 --> 16:48.048
great.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.550
You're telling me that?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.387
Are you okay?

16:53.388 --> 16:54.722
I try not to focus too much

16:54.723 --> 16:56.557
on the repercussions,
psychologically,

16:56.558 --> 16:58.308
of the more... recent events

16:58.309 --> 16:59.518
that are happening in my life,

16:59.519 --> 17:00.769
because...

17:00.770 --> 17:03.689
my chest gets tight,
and my hands start to shake, and...

17:03.690 --> 17:05.941
I think I want to scream,
and then I just want to scream,

17:05.942 --> 17:08.153
and never stop screaming...

17:18.288 --> 17:20.998
If there's one thing
Dirk taught me,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.459
it's that it has to be
going somewhere.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.587
It all has to be
going somewhere.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.964
It got us this far, right?

17:28.965 --> 17:30.132
"Got us this far?"

17:30.133 --> 17:32.301
in relation to what?

17:32.302 --> 17:33.761
We need to get to Dirk.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.095
Blackwing has the answer.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.014
Blackwing is the solution.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.850
Does Blackwing suck?

17:39.934 --> 17:41.769
Does it...

17:41.770 --> 17:43.479
suck, sir?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.731
This is Project Moloch?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.483
This is the most powerful subject

17:47.484 --> 17:48.942
that Riggins ever brought in,

17:48.943 --> 17:52.112
and he was just like, what, in a, just...

17:52.113 --> 17:53.322
...in a normal hospital?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.324
He'd been transferred several times

17:55.325 --> 17:57.659
after Blackwing shut down.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.912
He actually suffered a stroke
when we transported him--

17:59.913 --> 18:01.455
Yeah, okay, whatever, but, like,

18:01.456 --> 18:03.666
this guy is...

18:04.834 --> 18:06.210
<i>He's...</i>

18:06.211 --> 18:08.253
...not cool.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.048
He's not. He's just, like...

18:13.718 --> 18:15.094
Stupid!

18:15.095 --> 18:16.470
But...

18:16.471 --> 18:18.014
what about Project Alpha?

18:37.325 --> 18:38.242
Okay...

18:43.957 --> 18:46.208
Hi.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.586
You're not the usual scientist.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.339
You're, uh, you're new.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.007
Hey, hey, hey, listen,

18:54.008 --> 18:55.342
look at me, look at me.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.470
You have gotta get me out of here, okay?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.264
I've been in here for...

19:00.265 --> 19:01.807
Look...

19:01.808 --> 19:02.808
70 days.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.476
Can you see? 70 days.
Look, look.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.562
Every day they just keep
asking me the same question

19:06.563 --> 19:09.982
about if I have some kind
of super power, but I don't!

19:09.983 --> 19:11.525
I don't!

19:11.526 --> 19:12.986
You've gotta let me talk
to who's in charge.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.863
I'm in charge.

19:17.782 --> 19:18.783
You are?

19:20.785 --> 19:22.119
So...

19:22.120 --> 19:23.496
how does your power work?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.583
I don't have a power.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.168
Okay? I'm a tech guy.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.961
Computers.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.380
You survived seven days
with Project Marzanna.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.840
Marzanna...

19:34.841 --> 19:36.216
Bart?

19:36.217 --> 19:38.427
She kills everybody
that she comes in contact with,

19:38.428 --> 19:39.803
except you,

19:39.804 --> 19:42.306
therefore you must have powers.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.515
No, I've told you people,

19:43.516 --> 19:44.975
Bart wasn't trying to kill me.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.143
How does the dog work?

19:46.144 --> 19:49.229
How does the dog...

19:49.230 --> 19:50.731
"work"?

19:50.732 --> 19:51.899
Really?

19:51.900 --> 19:54.067
Look, man, enough!

19:54.068 --> 19:56.445
All right, you've got
to start listening to me--

19:59.782 --> 20:01.742
This is just, like...

20:01.743 --> 20:03.243
such a bummer.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.745
See, this program,

20:04.746 --> 20:07.539
it used to collect people
with weird abilities,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.125
and then it all, like, fell apart,

20:10.126 --> 20:11.668
but then I started it back up again,

20:11.669 --> 20:15.297
but we can't find any of the cool people
that they used to have,

20:15.298 --> 20:17.257
like, like the human bomb,

20:17.258 --> 20:18.634
or the invisible guy,

20:18.635 --> 20:20.052
or the shapeshifter...

20:20.053 --> 20:23.013
Are you saying there are other Barts?

20:23.014 --> 20:26.058
Yeah, except that's the catch,

20:26.059 --> 20:28.101
is they suck.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.020
The vampire guys are crazy,

20:30.021 --> 20:33.106
and we couldn't even find
Project Marzanna, just gone!

20:33.107 --> 20:34.066
And then Icarus--

20:34.067 --> 20:35.525
I mean, Dirk Gently--

20:35.526 --> 20:38.070
is, like, lame and annoying,

20:38.071 --> 20:40.364
and then there's this other guy
who's literally in a coma.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.658
Look, man,

20:42.659 --> 20:45.619
they're connected to the thing,

20:45.620 --> 20:48.413
the fabric of reality.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.998
You can't keep them locked up.

20:49.999 --> 20:54.544
All right? These kind of people
need to be out in the world, and--

20:54.545 --> 20:56.171
Please don't shock me...

20:56.172 --> 20:58.131
please don't shock me.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.175
So you're saying...

21:00.176 --> 21:02.344
I need to expose them to each other?

21:02.345 --> 21:03.512
No.

21:03.513 --> 21:04.930
No, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.390
But you said that maybe?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.308
No, I definitely didn't say that,

21:08.309 --> 21:09.351
because you--

21:10.353 --> 21:11.728
Sorry, that-that was an accident.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.566
Thank you.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.318
No, wait, wait, wait,
please, no, no, no!

21:18.319 --> 21:19.611
Wait, hey! Hey!

21:19.612 --> 21:20.904
You've got to get me
out of here, please, okay?

21:20.905 --> 21:21.905
I'm a normal person!

21:21.906 --> 21:23.741
I'm a normal person!

21:29.414 --> 21:32.416
<i>Alert. Alert. Alert.</i>

21:32.417 --> 21:35.919
<i>Alert. Alert. Alert. Alert.</i>

21:35.920 --> 21:38.171
Come on, Dirk,
we have to go now.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.298
You came...

21:39.299 --> 21:41.800
You came to rescue me!

21:41.801 --> 21:42.884
That's right, we're badasses now.

21:42.885 --> 21:43.927
We're big badasses,

21:43.928 --> 21:45.137
and we came to rescue you, Dirk.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.179
We used a magic rock

21:46.180 --> 21:48.515
given to us by Thor to find you.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.850
I knew I could rely on Thor!

21:49.851 --> 21:51.685
Hurry up. We have to get
to the Lost City of Gold

21:51.686 --> 21:53.603
to collect the Sacred Algae
before it's too late!

21:53.604 --> 21:55.355
Yeah, Dirk, we need that algae!

21:55.356 --> 21:57.567
Okay! Let's go!

22:01.195 --> 22:02.363
Oh.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.742
This is a dream, isn't it?

22:06.993 --> 22:07.868
Yeah.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.412
Yeah. It is.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.212
Hands off, hands off.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.256
I am not a shopping cart!

22:29.682 --> 22:30.892
Oh...

22:33.519 --> 22:35.521
What have they done to you?

22:43.071 --> 22:44.572
Hello, Suzanne.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.700
Do I know you?

22:48.701 --> 22:49.827
No.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.747
But it is lovely to meet
such a beautiful ray of sunshine.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.582
Um, I...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.044
May I?

22:59.796 --> 23:03.006
Oh, my gosh, that's you, isn't it?

23:03.007 --> 23:04.049
That was from when I won

23:04.050 --> 23:07.094
the Ohio Junior Membermazing Competition.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.846
I memorized the whole
first act of <i>Macbeth.</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:12.682
You were happy then.

23:12.683 --> 23:13.768
Yes.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.812
I think more people
respected me when I was nine

23:16.813 --> 23:19.564
than they do now that I'm 40.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.774
It's kinda, um...

23:20.775 --> 23:22.609
Sad?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.986
I was gonna say "funny."

23:24.987 --> 23:26.864
It's that too, I suppose.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.828
Can I speak to your master?

23:32.829 --> 23:33.996
My what?

23:34.497 --> 23:36.081
The person in charge.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.332
Oh.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.625
Dan.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.210
Yeah, Dan, he's, uh...

23:40.211 --> 23:41.212
Uh...

23:42.422 --> 23:44.424
Hey, Dan!
Can you come out here?

23:50.555 --> 23:52.056
Aw, dang it.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.266
Suzie, you brainless--

23:54.267 --> 23:55.142
Oops.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.685
Hello, Dan.

23:56.686 --> 23:57.769
Look...

23:57.770 --> 24:01.106
those guys you've got me
dealing with are criminals.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.233
This is...

24:03.359 --> 24:04.569
...too much.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.988
I just wanted to make
a little bit of money, and...

24:07.989 --> 24:10.616
and now that's over, so...

24:11.701 --> 24:13.160
get out,

24:13.161 --> 24:15.662
or else.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.622
Okay.

24:17.623 --> 24:18.958
I understand.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.131
Bye-bye.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.511
Or else what?

24:31.512 --> 24:33.847
What's stopping me from simply
taking one of your trucks?

24:33.848 --> 24:35.056
I'll call the police.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.393
The police,
and they'd bring an army.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.020
An army?

24:40.021 --> 24:42.482
The police are people that would hurt me,
they'd cause a problem for me.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.652
Suzie, if you'd be so kind.

25:07.715 --> 25:13.011
Have you noticed an acceleration
of strangeness in your life?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.013
Mm-hm.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.558
This is the only file
I could find on record

25:18.559 --> 25:20.268
with any connection to Blackwing,

25:20.269 --> 25:23.439
but it had been years
since anyone had accessed it.

25:24.398 --> 25:25.900
It doesn't look military.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.321
This is the address.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.365
Todd?

25:32.740 --> 25:34.074
This is it.

25:34.075 --> 25:35.326
This is gonna be it.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.953
Look at those cameras.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.456
They're rusted out.
No one's been here in years.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.124
This isn't Blackwing.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.377
So that means it's safe.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.920
Todd...

25:46.921 --> 25:48.505
stop.

25:48.506 --> 25:50.131
You're gonna stress yourself out

25:50.132 --> 25:51.383
and give yourself an attack!

25:51.384 --> 25:52.759
I got it! Okay.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.970
Let's go!

25:55.054 --> 25:56.680
He's losing his mind...

25:56.681 --> 25:57.764
We're close!

25:57.765 --> 25:59.183
This is something!

26:00.560 --> 26:02.603
Okay, here we go, here we go.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.231
Todd, slow down.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.360
Do you feel that?

26:10.361 --> 26:11.529
Feel what?

26:12.446 --> 26:14.114
Something weird.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.575
Old spooky house
with the government fences

26:16.576 --> 26:18.118
in the middle of nowhere?

26:18.119 --> 26:20.203
Like...

26:20.204 --> 26:24.332
this is some kind of... thing, right?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.252
Look at the locks on these doors.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.841
Todd?

26:33.134 --> 26:35.176
Seriously?

26:35.177 --> 26:36.720
Okay, it's wet!

26:36.721 --> 26:39.265
It's wet! This is a wet... thing.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.266
This is a thing, right?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.977
Why else would there be water here?

26:43.728 --> 26:46.313
What does any of this have to do with Dirk

26:46.314 --> 26:47.522
or Blackwing?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.441
I don't know, but this is it,

26:49.442 --> 26:51.526
this is special, this is a thing,

26:51.527 --> 26:52.777
and then a-another thing,

26:52.778 --> 26:53.653
and, bam!

26:53.654 --> 26:55.071
It all connects.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.157
We're close, we are so close,

26:57.158 --> 26:58.367
we are, like...

26:59.201 --> 27:00.869
this close!

27:00.870 --> 27:03.456
You're holding your fingers pretty far apart.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.876
You know, I actually had friends
out there for once?

27:07.877 --> 27:11.838
This woman, Farah,
she was really incredible,

27:11.839 --> 27:15.634
like a... like a ninja-woman, and I--

27:15.635 --> 27:18.178
Ooh... rough news,

27:18.179 --> 27:20.639
I have replaced you as my assistant.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.016
The new guy, Todd...

27:23.017 --> 27:25.226
is perfect.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.728
Although, warning,

27:26.729 --> 27:29.481
there's a chance the government
might have killed them both--

27:30.566 --> 27:33.360
So, you've, like...

27:33.361 --> 27:34.361
met this guy before?

27:34.362 --> 27:35.820
<i>When I was small.</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:38.740
<i>Riggins used to
take me in to see him,</i>

27:38.741 --> 27:40.825
<i>and a few of the others
he said weren't too dangerous.</i>

27:40.826 --> 27:43.411
I remember him well.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.247
He always just laid there.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.000
Never interrupted me.

27:48.542 --> 27:51.211
He was the nicest person
I've ever met.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.921
<i>What have you done to him?</i>

27:52.922 --> 27:54.674
Why has he lost so much weight?

27:55.675 --> 27:57.635
He had a stroke
when we moved him.

27:58.678 --> 28:02.389
Am I supposed to, what,
magic him awake?

28:02.390 --> 28:05.141
Touch my forehead
and do a constipated face,

28:05.142 --> 28:07.310
and things get better?

28:07.311 --> 28:08.978
Because you've run out of ideas,

28:08.979 --> 28:12.650
and you know something bad
is going to happen soon?

28:14.110 --> 28:15.443
Whatever you're doing,

28:15.444 --> 28:17.237
it isn't going to work.

28:17.238 --> 28:19.989
<i>Fate and chance
are not mutually exclusive, Mr. Friedkin,</i>

28:19.990 --> 28:21.574
and if you keep on this path,

28:21.575 --> 28:23.577
you're going to get
a healthy dose of both.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.456
It's probably already started,

28:28.457 --> 28:30.626
and you haven't even noticed.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.922
Just... get him out of there.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.549
This isn't how it works.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.801
I am not a machine!

28:39.802 --> 28:41.177
You can't control it!

28:41.178 --> 28:42.929
<i>This isn't how it works!</i>

28:42.930 --> 28:45.141
Do you understand?
This isn't how it works!

28:58.529 --> 29:01.614
Mm mm mm mm mm mm

29:01.615 --> 29:02.615
Mm!

29:02.616 --> 29:05.076
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm...

29:14.086 --> 29:16.254
<i>Tina...</i>

29:17.339 --> 29:19.467
Tina Tevetino, get in here.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.471
Where the heck have you been?

29:24.305 --> 29:27.098
Okay... so...

29:27.099 --> 29:28.183
Yes, okay, I'm high,

29:28.184 --> 29:30.310
but I'm not drunk!

29:30.311 --> 29:31.728
Okay, I am drunk,

29:31.729 --> 29:33.563
but it was just white wine,

29:33.564 --> 29:35.482
and I slept most of it off.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.650
<i>Okay, I have been
sleeping in my car all day,</i>

29:37.651 --> 29:38.985
but guess what?

29:38.986 --> 29:40.153
Nothing happened.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.362
Nothing's gonna happen.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.115
Nothing ever happens!

29:44.366 --> 29:45.951
What's the face?

29:52.666 --> 29:54.210
Oh, something happened.

29:59.673 --> 30:01.382
There has to be a way up.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.842
There has to be a way up there,

30:02.843 --> 30:05.011
and then that'll be
a secret chamber, or something,

30:05.012 --> 30:05.887
or a tunnel, maybe?

30:05.888 --> 30:07.305
Or maybe it's invisible.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.182
Maybe we're looking at it right now.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.517
Is that stupid?

30:10.518 --> 30:11.434
No.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.393
Y-yes.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.646
No! No! Nothing is stupid!

30:14.647 --> 30:16.105
Todd...

30:16.106 --> 30:18.399
This place is abandoned,

30:18.400 --> 30:21.110
and there's no way into the house

30:21.111 --> 30:22.570
other than breaking in.

30:22.571 --> 30:23.488
Well, then let's break in.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.572
No! No,

30:24.573 --> 30:26.950
I have broken
enough laws tonight,

30:26.951 --> 30:28.743
and I don't want to risk
setting off an alarm.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.869
You don't want to risk it?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.162
Look at where we are.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.080
We're here.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.039
This is something.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.499
This is connected!

30:34.500 --> 30:37.001
Todd, we barely escaped Blackwing
in Seattle--

30:37.002 --> 30:38.379
Look! A rabbit!

30:39.964 --> 30:41.506
That can't be a coincidence.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.924
It's a rabbit.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.051
No, this rabbit is the answer.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.053
Maybe.

30:47.221 --> 30:48.888
Dirk, is that you?

30:48.889 --> 30:50.723
Maybe he's in the rabbit,

30:50.724 --> 30:54.102
or maybe he's some sort of
mechanical rabbit drone,

30:54.103 --> 30:56.230
or some kind of... space rabbit!

30:57.731 --> 30:59.774
You're... you're getting too worked up,

30:59.775 --> 31:01.067
okay, Todd?

31:01.068 --> 31:03.736
I think we should just
go back to the car, okay?

31:03.737 --> 31:04.821
I know, I know,

31:04.822 --> 31:07.031
you want this rabbit
to mean something--

31:07.032 --> 31:08.241
Look, he's getting away!

31:08.242 --> 31:09.243
Todd...

31:09.785 --> 31:11.620
Hey! Buddy!

31:12.997 --> 31:15.249
Ooh! Ooh! I got him! I got him!

31:16.417 --> 31:17.333
I got him!

31:17.334 --> 31:19.919
No, I don't. No, I don't.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.963
No, I don't.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.845
Gotta get it together.

31:28.137 --> 31:30.471
I'll just wash this off, and it'll all be okay.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.557
Just wash this off, it'll be okay.

31:32.558 --> 31:33.725
I got it.

31:33.726 --> 31:34.601
No more blood.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.102
Done, done, did it.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.062
Did it--

31:38.063 --> 31:39.522
Oh! Oh, no...

31:39.523 --> 31:42.318
This is a misunderstanding,
this is a misunder--!

31:44.403 --> 31:46.070
Put that garbage in the trunk.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.239
I could've called the police, but I didn't,

31:48.240 --> 31:50.116
'cause that man,
he said you were coming,

31:50.117 --> 31:52.076
and he said you would come,
and you'd get the body,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.996
and it would all be fine,
and it would be right as rain,

31:54.997 --> 31:55.830
and it would-- ow!

31:59.460 --> 32:01.337
Why did I protect him?

32:03.839 --> 32:05.298
Maybe I did this

32:05.299 --> 32:07.717
because I thought
it would be interesting...

32:07.718 --> 32:10.595
Oh, God, am I a bad person?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.430
- Shut up.
- Psst!

32:12.431 --> 32:14.141
You're supposed to use that thing, man.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.935
Wait, what are you doing?
Did you change your mind?

32:16.936 --> 32:18.144
Are you not going to kill me?

32:18.145 --> 32:19.354
Are you-- Did you change your mind?

32:19.355 --> 32:21.481
Excuse me,
did you change your mind? Excuse me--

32:21.482 --> 32:22.774
- Shut up.
- Okay.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.025
I can't read this shit.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.109
He said I'd be able to read it.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.694
It's in Chinese or something.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.488
What do you need the book for?

32:28.489 --> 32:30.282
<i>I thought Mister Mage
told you what to say.</i>

32:37.539 --> 32:38.832
<i>Borobotos!</i>

32:40.918 --> 32:42.336
<i>Borobotos.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:46.547
Shut up.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.841
<i>Borobotos!</i>

32:48.884 --> 32:49.968
Screw this, man,

32:49.969 --> 32:51.552
I don't have time for this Satanist shit!

32:51.553 --> 32:53.680
If she's dead, she's dead,
who cares how I kill her?

32:53.681 --> 32:54.597
No, no, no, no, no!

32:54.598 --> 32:56.099
No, no, no!

33:11.156 --> 33:12.449
Do you know Ken?

33:13.575 --> 33:15.159
No.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.578
I don't know Ken.

33:21.375 --> 33:22.918
Who are you?

33:26.797 --> 33:28.798
You know, um...

33:28.799 --> 33:33.720
I'm not going to kill you,
even though it feels like I should.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.930
And I think that sometimes,
when you're killing people,

33:35.931 --> 33:37.141
they don't like it.

33:38.559 --> 33:42.729
And it makes them unhappy,
and... and scared,

33:42.730 --> 33:44.147
and also dead,

33:44.148 --> 33:46.692
which they don't like,
I don't think, so...

33:49.570 --> 33:52.280
I'm not going to kill you
to make you a happier person.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.781
Oh, God, thank you.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.783
Thank you.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.909
Are you happy now that I'm not killing you?

33:56.910 --> 33:58.536
Yes. Yes.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.080
Well, then why aren't you smiling?

34:00.956 --> 34:01.956
W-What?

34:01.957 --> 34:04.835
You should be doing a smile, like...

34:18.348 --> 34:21.518
Well, so, do you wanna come with me
and be best friends?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.148
No...?

34:27.274 --> 34:29.693
No, I just want to go home.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.781
Yeah, well, fine!

34:34.782 --> 34:36.658
I already have a friend anyway!

34:37.701 --> 34:40.828
Maybe I should just kill you after all!

34:42.831 --> 34:44.333
You hear that, universe?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.626
I don't have to listen to you
if I don't wanna!

34:46.627 --> 34:50.296
<i>I am the boss of me, not you!</i>

34:50.297 --> 34:51.632
I could...I could go...

34:56.929 --> 34:58.472
<i>Borobotos!</i>

35:06.021 --> 35:07.189
I'm sorry.

35:09.108 --> 35:10.275
I'm so sorry.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.703
Todd!

35:22.704 --> 35:23.830
Oh!

35:23.831 --> 35:25.498
Great, you caught up.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.333
Did you see where it went?

35:27.334 --> 35:28.752
It was somewhere around here.

35:29.670 --> 35:33.047
Todd, I have been looking for you

35:33.048 --> 35:35.007
for five hours.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.510
Farah, don't be ridiculous. It was...

35:37.511 --> 35:38.553
Seven.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.346
Oh! Maybe the tree?

35:40.347 --> 35:41.264
Help me climb the tree!

35:41.265 --> 35:42.266
Todd, stop.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.101
Stop!

35:44.893 --> 35:46.978
It's 5:00 a.m.,

35:46.979 --> 35:50.065
and you want to climb a tree
looking for a rabbit.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.820
I am not the most

35:55.821 --> 35:58.990
emotionally, you know,
communicative person,

35:58.991 --> 36:00.658
and I know you aren't either,

36:00.659 --> 36:01.993
but given what
we've been through together,

36:01.994 --> 36:03.286
we need to talk,

36:03.287 --> 36:05.788
because this is too much now.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.708
I have done the best I can for you,

36:08.709 --> 36:10.710
used every trick I know,

36:10.711 --> 36:14.172
hacking government servers,
fake IDs, stealing cars,

36:14.173 --> 36:16.717
but this "everything is connected" stuff,

36:18.760 --> 36:21.888
that's not real for you.

36:21.889 --> 36:23.055
It's a delusion--

36:23.056 --> 36:25.725
Hey, I'm in the same position as you.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.185
My life was ruined,

36:27.186 --> 36:28.060
destroyed.

36:28.061 --> 36:30.188
I was fired,
my apartment was wrecked,

36:30.189 --> 36:34.066
I've been beaten and- and electrocuted
multiple times.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.695
I have a disease
that puts me in constant fear.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.363
But I saw something real,

36:39.364 --> 36:43.367
something beyond anything
I could have ever imagined,

36:43.368 --> 36:46.078
I saw incredible things,

36:46.079 --> 36:48.623
and I believe it, Farah, I do

36:48.624 --> 36:50.249
This has to have a point--

36:50.250 --> 36:52.877
Whatever Dirk showed you,

36:52.878 --> 36:56.255
it isn't nice, Todd,

36:56.256 --> 36:57.632
it isn't helpful.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.717
It doesn't protect people.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.511
If this is real,

37:02.512 --> 37:06.015
it doesn't choose sides,

37:06.016 --> 37:09.268
and you're not Dirk.

37:09.269 --> 37:13.314
Even if this was
to somehow lead to Dirk,

37:13.315 --> 37:15.942
he can't cure your pararibulitus.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.693
Cure my--

37:17.694 --> 37:19.862
You think that's
what this is about?

37:19.863 --> 37:22.490
No, I deserve my pararibulitus.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.575
I deserve all of this, and worse.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.078
I want to find Dirk to help you.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.331
I want to find Dirk to help him.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.584
I need to find Dirk because...

37:34.253 --> 37:36.338
Because it's the only way
back to Amanda.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.549
She called me, Farah,

37:40.550 --> 37:43.094
when whatever happened to her happened,

37:43.095 --> 37:44.513
she called me.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.517
This has to be real.

37:49.518 --> 37:51.144
It has to mean something.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.562
It's our only option.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.190
It's the only way back to a normal life.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.443
It's the only way for me
to make things right.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.654
So, what,

38:01.655 --> 38:04.949
we're just supposed
to keep wandering around,

38:04.950 --> 38:07.536
waiting for something weird to happen?

38:10.998 --> 38:12.540
Well, maybe.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.731
What are you doing here?

40:42.732 --> 40:44.776
Find the boy.
