00:45.879 --> 00:48.673
It's been a long time, Mr. Yashiro.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.095
I didn't expect you to get here first,
Satoru.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.142
I've come to end this once and for all.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.479
And I was getting everything ready
to kill you.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.324
Just as I thought,

01:15.325 --> 01:17.911
you've regained your memories
and intuition.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.538
I'm surprised.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
You realized I would use the cell phone,

01:23.666 --> 01:26.711
something that didn't exist
when you were my student.

01:27.921 --> 01:28.922
But just in case,

01:29.714 --> 01:31.800
I had an analog backup.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.938
It seems that one
was a little more effective.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.692
In any case...

01:50.944 --> 01:54.072
you're here too soon
considering your legs.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.491
In my calculation,

01:57.033 --> 01:59.744
she would show up
right after I set my trap,

02:00.203 --> 02:02.497
and then you would arrive shortly after.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.709
Yet as things are...
you're outside the trap,

02:07.836 --> 02:09.211
and I'm inside it.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.923
How did you do it?

02:15.301 --> 02:17.762
You were never going to kill Kumi,
were you?

02:18.847 --> 02:21.391
-You were after me from the start.
-No.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.227
I planned this intending to kill her.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.146
However,

02:26.813 --> 02:29.315
I also had faith that you would stop me.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.778
I mean, the only person
worth killing to me is you,

02:34.779 --> 02:37.198
the one who fights to keep others alive.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.709
That glint in your eye that

02:48.376 --> 02:50.879
you always have
when facing the impossible.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.924
I've witnessed it
countless times in the past,

02:55.550 --> 02:58.511
and how you've achieved success
each time.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.807
And now... your eyes are telling me this.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.102
That you will overcome this, as well.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.063
Tell me, Satoru.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.902
What is the truth behind...
that glint in your eye?

03:20.158 --> 03:22.619
The answer is rather simple and obvious.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.833
If you sensed something in my eyes...

03:30.126 --> 03:31.169
then that is...

03:35.340 --> 03:37.258
a will to follow through.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.848
The resolve to step forward.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.127
What keeps me going

04:13.836 --> 04:17.298
are the many words given to me
by the people I hold dear.

04:19.968 --> 04:24.305
They've saved me, encouraged me,
and pushed me.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.435
They taught me that you can't open
a new door without moving forward.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.107
Wanting to fill the void inside yourself.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.860
These words did the same for me.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.699
Both when I was a kid,
and even after I woke up.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.994
They gave me the power to take action.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.504
You said the same thing that day
in the car 17 years ago.

04:58.423 --> 05:02.135
When I heard you say those words
as a grade school kid,

05:02.510 --> 05:03.970
I was honestly surprised.

05:06.764 --> 05:07.890
I'm sure you were.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.268
That's because...

05:11.728 --> 05:16.399
they're the words I heard from you
when I graduated from grade school.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.112
They're your own words, Mr. Yashiro.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.412
I've been a fifth-grader three times now.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.750
And this is my second time living in 2005.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.796
I... I've relived the past
a number of times now.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.135
Do you believe me?

06:10.995 --> 06:13.748
I do... Satoru.

06:19.837 --> 06:24.050
Even if I wanted to deny it...
there are so many things it would explain.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.054
It all makes sense now.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.390
You also said this:

06:32.725 --> 06:36.896
That courageous actions
shouldn't end in tragedy.

06:39.315 --> 06:44.445
I believe that... I was able to regain
so many things because of these words.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.616
So, Mr. Yashiro,
why don't we end things here.

06:56.165 --> 06:56.999
Satoru...

06:58.251 --> 06:59.544
am I evil?

07:02.630 --> 07:03.548
No, I know.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.218
That's how the world would measure me.

07:07.844 --> 07:08.678
But...

07:11.139 --> 07:13.641
are society's principles in the right?

07:18.563 --> 07:21.357
Aren't they just a fabrication
so those who deny

07:21.649 --> 07:25.778
their deepest desires can show
that they are good people?

07:29.198 --> 07:32.618
I judge my actions by my own measure...

07:34.495 --> 07:35.830
and justify them.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.634
Satoru. You're right.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.222
Let's end things here.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.060
STAFF

08:23.294 --> 08:25.421
The last thing for me to do,

08:25.880 --> 08:28.966
is to end this all
with both of our deaths.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.344
I...

08:32.511 --> 08:36.390
I reject being punished by a worldview
I don't accept.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.769
And, Satoru...

08:41.729 --> 08:44.315
what you will get
in exchange for your life,

08:45.316 --> 08:46.651
is my end...

08:48.194 --> 08:49.612
in the form of my death.

09:14.971 --> 09:20.851
You won't get any of that.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.401
I haven't given you an answer
to your first question.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.947
The reason I was able to get here
so quickly.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.120
It's something my doctor told me.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.124
He said that that the power
of the human will...

09:45.459 --> 09:47.128
can defy medical explanation.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.504
Satoru! Satoru!

11:43.452 --> 11:44.328
You did good.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.330
Both of you.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.074
I've been wanting Satoru to wake up

12:22.867 --> 12:24.577
ever since that day.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.413
What?

12:28.789 --> 12:30.708
My actions, my thoughts...

12:32.626 --> 12:33.961
Satoru was the only one

12:35.171 --> 12:36.630
who ever understood me.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.637
And after Satoru
fell into his coma, I've...

12:45.389 --> 12:47.141
I really became alone.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.899
I asked myself
what I was supposed to do next.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.987
The answer was very simple.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.158
I would stay near Satoru

13:05.075 --> 13:07.953
and continue to watch over him.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.127
And so you even became a city councilman.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.630
And on that day...

13:21.008 --> 13:23.177
When Satoru finally awoke...

13:25.304 --> 13:26.430
I was so happy...

13:27.890 --> 13:29.517
I couldn't stop crying.

13:31.977 --> 13:32.811
I wasn't...

13:35.064 --> 13:36.524
I wasn't alone anymore.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.114
When I saw Satoru moving...

13:45.699 --> 13:51.121
my heart was filled with an exuberance
I hadn't felt for over 10 years.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.666
That's why I took action.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.169
All in order...

13:59.421 --> 14:01.549
All in order to end, with my own hands,

14:02.716 --> 14:03.551
Satoru...

14:04.969 --> 14:07.012
the only boy I wasn't able to kill.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.645
So, you admit that you
intended to kill him?

14:17.022 --> 14:17.856
Yes.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.734
Of course!

14:28.409 --> 14:30.411
CHIBA SERIAL MURDERS

14:30.494 --> 14:34.498
NISHIZONO SENTENCED TO DEATH

14:44.717 --> 14:45.551
Come in. Satoru.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.305
Hi.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.390
Have a seat.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.101
Thanks for making time for me.

14:54.435 --> 14:58.188
I'll always make time for you
if you want to hear about Yashiro.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.485
I heard his death sentence was finalized.

15:04.111 --> 15:04.945
Yeah.

15:06.822 --> 15:11.076
Yashiro was guilty of over
30 murders in total.

15:12.119 --> 15:16.624
Most were past the statute of limitations,
but we were able to charge him for

15:17.458 --> 15:20.210
the eight murders
and attempted murders in Chiba.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.630
He confessed to all of them.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.049
The time

15:25.925 --> 15:30.804
taken from you and those falsely accused
can never be returned.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.431
But...

15:33.766 --> 15:37.811
even if it's just a little,
I think we were able to ease your pain.

15:49.823 --> 15:50.991
Thank you, Satoru.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.495
I'm proud that I was able to

15:55.704 --> 15:56.705
be by your side.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.333
Kenya... And also...

16:09.385 --> 16:10.928
I'm sorry, Satoru.

16:12.471 --> 16:16.100
It's my fault your part in this
cost you so much.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.979
-I--
-I don't feel like it has.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.942
I was the one that was saved.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.822
I should be the one thanking you.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.408
I was able to step forward

16:33.575 --> 16:35.244
because I had you by my side.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.374
Thank you, Kenya.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.549
Do you think

16:49.675 --> 16:51.760
we came close to becoming heroes?

16:55.222 --> 17:00.477
It certainly wasn't all pretty,
but I'd like to believe we have.

<i>My favorite manga comic </i> Wonder Guy
<i>was made into a TV show.</i>

19:28.542 --> 19:31.170
<i>Wonder Guy had been fighting alone,</i>

19:31.753 --> 19:35.424
<i>but with a trusting heart as his weapon,</i>
<i>he made more friends.</i>

19:37.718 --> 19:40.512
<i>I also want to make many friends</i>

19:41.138 --> 19:42.389

19:50.022 --> 19:53.650

20:11.710 --> 20:13.128

THE WORLD KING OF FLAMES
BY SATORU FUJINUMA SATORU FUJINUMA
"NEO CENTURY YUKI"

21:15.816 --> 21:18.527
I'm going to step out
to work on the storyboard.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.987
Okay. Leave this to us.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.164
Bye!

21:31.373 --> 21:33.083
Bye!

22:01.903 --> 22:03.572
It's cold out there today!

22:03.655 --> 22:04.990
Oh, hello, Mr. Urata.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.534
What?! Where's Mr. Fujinuma?

22:07.617 --> 22:10.954
-He's out working on the storyboard.
-What, he's not here?!

22:11.038 --> 22:12.956
Come on, I splurged on these

22:13.040 --> 22:16.293
because we just got picked up
for an anime adaptation.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.253
Really?!

22:18.337 --> 22:21.340
Yes! And we're going to be
the tentpole for 2012!

22:21.423 --> 22:22.883
We made it, everyone!

22:24.009 --> 22:25.135
That's awesome!

22:25.218 --> 22:26.595
Yes!

22:26.678 --> 22:29.723
-Yeah!
-Mr. Fujinuma is going to be a mogul now!

22:31.224 --> 22:32.059
Let's drink!

22:32.142 --> 22:35.228
No, not yet! You can't!
Especially not you!

22:35.312 --> 22:37.814
-Why not?
-Remember how bad you got last time?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.942
So, definitely not you!
Not even when Mr. Fujinuma gets back.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.903
-You just stick to water.
-Okay, fine.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.323
Good. Okay, so let's hide it all
and keep it a surprise.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.116
Let's hide all this,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.369
and start by having everyone look
a little gloomy first.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.371
-Okay.
-Let's go with that.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.539
Satoru,

22:55.499 --> 22:58.502
you're living your dream.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.337
I bought these!

23:00.837 --> 23:01.671
Not you!

23:19.147 --> 23:22.109
<i>I haven't experienced a Revival</i>
<i>since I woke up.</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:42.003
<i>It must be because this moment</i>
<i>is the real timeline.</i>

23:54.307 --> 23:58.728
<i>I can tell that the memories from my</i>
<i>first timeline when I never fell asleep</i>

23:58.812 --> 24:00.647
<i>are starting to fade.</i>

24:04.151 --> 24:08.738
<i>The 15 years I've been asleep...</i>
<i>I was never alone.</i>

24:10.740 --> 24:14.494
<i>I had friends who filled in</i>
<i>the blank spaces.</i>

24:17.289 --> 24:19.958
<i>Nothing made me prouder than that.</i>

24:21.585 --> 24:26.339
<i>And it shines brightly inside my heart.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.514
<i>The city where only I am gone.</i>

24:36.224 --> 24:41.104
<i>I treasure nothing more</i>
<i>than the time I spent there.</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:49.070
<i>The city where only I am gone.</i>

26:00.016 --> 26:01.768
It's really coming down!

26:02.602 --> 26:03.937
It's crazy, right?

26:09.025 --> 26:11.278
Could I join you until the snow passes?

26:23.707 --> 26:26.334
<i>The snow blankets the scenery in white.</i>

27:09.794 --> 27:12.964
<i>The future has been turned blank.</i>
