00:54.888 --> 00:56.879
<i>I read this article</i>
<i>a while back...</i>

00:56.956 --> 00:59.857
<i>that said Microsoft employs more</i>
<i>millionaire secretaries...</i>

00:59.926 --> 01:02.326
<i>than any other company</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.728
<i>They took stock options</i>
<i>over Christmas bonuses.</i>

01:05.799 --> 01:07.994
<i>It was a good move.</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:10.559
<i>I remember there was this photograph</i>
<i>of one of the groundskeepers...</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:12.832
<i>next to his Ferrari.</i>

01:12.906 --> 01:14.931
<i>Blew my mind.</i>

01:15.008 --> 01:18.000
<i>You see shit like that,</i>
<i>and it just plants seeds...</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:20.603
<i>makes you think it's possible,</i>
<i>even easy.</i>

01:20.680 --> 01:23.808
<i>And then you turn on the TV,</i>
<i>and there's just more of it.</i>

01:23.883 --> 01:26.408
<i>The $87 million dollar</i>
<i>lottery winner.</i>

01:26.486 --> 01:29.614
<i>That kid actor that just made</i>
<i>20 million on his last movie.</i>

01:29.689 --> 01:32.214
<i>That Internet stock that</i>
<i>shot through the roof.</i>

01:32.292 --> 01:35.420
<i>You could've made millions on it</i>
<i>if you'd just got in early.</i>

01:35.495 --> 01:39.625
<i>And that's exactly</i>
<i>what I wanted to do... get in.</i>

01:39.699 --> 01:44.068
<i>I didn't want to be an innovator. I just</i>
<i>wanted to make the quick, easy buck.</i>

01:44.137 --> 01:46.469
<i>I just wanted in.</i>

01:47.640 --> 01:49.938
<i>Notorious B.I.G.</i>
<i>Said it best...</i>

01:50.009 --> 01:53.410
<i>"Either you're slinging crack rock,</i>
<i>or you got a wicked jump shot. "</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:55.846
<i>Nobody wants to work</i>
<i>for it anymore.</i>

01:55.915 --> 01:59.544
<i>There's no honor in taking</i>
<i>that after-school job at Mickey D's.</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:02.486
<i>Honor's in the dollar, kid.</i>

02:02.555 --> 02:05.615
<i>So I went the white-boy way</i>
<i>of slinging crack rock.</i>

02:05.692 --> 02:07.353
<i>I became a stockbroker.</i>

02:14.267 --> 02:17.668
- Get off!
- Two hundred!

02:17.737 --> 02:20.570
Put your money back down!
Yo! Put your money back down!

02:41.895 --> 02:45.092
<i>So I got in at this firm,</i>
<i>J. T. Marlin...</i>

02:45.165 --> 02:48.100
<i>owned by</i>
<i>this guy Michael Brantley...</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:50.500
<i>a salesman among salesmen.</i>

02:50.570 --> 02:53.505
Mr. Brantley!

02:53.573 --> 02:57.339
- Mr. Brantley! Welcome! How are you?
- How you gonna handle these guys?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.901
- They're great.
- You think you can handle this or what?

02:59.979 --> 03:02.914
- I think so. We can handle it.
- You can handle it?

03:10.323 --> 03:12.257
A double scotch on the rocks.

03:20.266 --> 03:23.463
Holy shit, yo.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

03:23.536 --> 03:26.835
That's the jockey from Venezuela.
He's a sicko. He weighs like 48 pounds.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.670
119, but you're close, slut.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.903
Whatever. Give me three-to-one
on that skinny little nigger.

03:31.978 --> 03:36.210
Richie, Richie.
Do me a favor, will you?

03:36.282 --> 03:38.716
Just for, like, ten minutes.
Just give it a rest.

03:38.785 --> 03:43.119
Yo, homes, I need some "chocaine."
I need some motherfuckin' nose candy.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.248
I need some cizzi up my nizzi...

03:45.325 --> 03:47.316
'cause I need to get high
like a motherfucker.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.453
Know what I'm sayin'?
So give me some of that nose candy.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.862
Bring that table over here.

03:52.932 --> 03:57.198
Everybody quiet down for a second.
All right. Hold on.

03:57.270 --> 04:02.469
Thanks. I wanted to let you know those
pikers at the N.A.S.D. Are off our ass.

04:05.144 --> 04:09.581
- Fuckin' retard.
- Fuck you. I'm on vacation.

04:09.649 --> 04:13.278
Bear Stearns can call the S.E.C.
They can't find any dirt on us.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.789
J.T. Marlin, once again,
has unlimited trading authorization.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.620
I told you guys.
You can't keep a good man down!

04:21.226 --> 04:22.819
We're superstars now.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.887
J.P. Morgan just faxed over
their congratulations...

04:25.965 --> 04:27.956
and said,
"Welcome to the club."

04:29.902 --> 04:32.837
This also means those teams
headed by Todd and Richie...

04:32.905 --> 04:35.305
who were good enough
to give up their rep numbers...

04:35.375 --> 04:38.071
They can stop cold calling
and start trading again.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.237
Welcome back!

04:40.313 --> 04:42.281
And just to show you
how appreciative I am...

04:42.348 --> 04:43.610
there's a little something extra.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.379
Tell me about it, baby, tell me!

04:46.452 --> 04:49.182
I want you guys
to go up to suite 418.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.255
I handpicked them myself.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.198
We're players now, boys!
Let's celebrate. Salute!

06:29.155 --> 06:32.283
Don't touch the cards.
Don't touch the cards.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.126
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.694
Come on, Mike. I told you you
gotta hit the table. Sixteen.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.139
Hit me.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.802
And bust.
Sorry about that.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.904
Fuck! Can't
win a fuckin' hand tonight!

06:54.981 --> 06:57.745
Hey, Steve?
Come here for a second.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.580
You thirsty?
I don't care.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.416
Go take my car and get Mike a Coke
and a falafel. You hungry?

07:02.488 --> 07:05.719
Yeah. Yeah.
Sure. Why not?

07:05.792 --> 07:07.760
- And dealer busts.
- Yeah!

07:07.827 --> 07:09.818
What the fuck are
you so happy about?

07:09.896 --> 07:12.057
Whoa, take it easy.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.326
Roller coaster.
Ups and downs. You know that.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.426
All right. Place your bets.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.096
<i>I was living in Kew Gardens Hills,</i>
<i>running my biz...</i>

07:21.174 --> 07:24.439
<i>giving the Queens College kids</i>
<i>something to do between classes.</i>

07:24.510 --> 07:27.070
- See you guys.
- Fuck you.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.445
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- <i>I was doing well.</i>

07:41.093 --> 07:44.119
<i>It's strange to think how</i>
<i>that knock changed everything.</i>

07:44.197 --> 07:47.758
<i>Everything.</i>
<i>Hey, don't get me wrong here.</i>

07:47.834 --> 07:49.324
No, no. I got it.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.963
<i>I don't believe in fate.</i>
<i>I believe in odds.</i>

07:53.039 --> 07:55.132
- He's not gonna let you in.
- Why not?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.142
'Cause he doesn't know who you are.
He'll think you're a cop.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.941
So what? I got a bankroll
that'll choke a hippo. Let's just see.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.607
- Who are you?
- What's up?

08:03.683 --> 08:08.347
- It's my boy, Greg. Oh, shit!
- What are you doin'? Come in.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.049
What's goin' on? Come here, crazy.
What are you doin'?

08:11.123 --> 08:13.956
How're you doin'?
Come in. Come in.

08:15.461 --> 08:19.363
Oh, shit. Wait.
Is that your new ride?

08:19.432 --> 08:22.230
- Him.
- Nice.

08:22.301 --> 08:24.292
- Hi. Seth.
- Hey. Greg.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.701
Nice to meet you.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.934
- We thought we were done for the night.
- Too late to get a couple hands in?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.999
No, no, no. 24-7.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.642
Hey, Steve, could you get us
a couple of sandwiches?

08:37.383 --> 08:40.409
- All right. Give me 400.
- Wait. What about the betting?

08:40.486 --> 08:44.650
- What were you thinking?
- Five hundred, max?

08:46.425 --> 08:48.893
We don't usually
service that level of action...

08:48.961 --> 08:51.156
but I hate
to turn away a new customer.

08:51.230 --> 08:54.324
We might not have enough cash
to settle you at the end of the night.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.392
That's okay.
You can just pay me tomorrow.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.938
All right.
How much you want?

09:00.006 --> 09:03.635
- Five dimes.
- Jeff.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.006
You had to do it, didn't you?

09:05.077 --> 09:06.738
You make me look
like I'm at the kiddie table.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.906
- If the shoe fits, kid. Come on.
- Fuckin' rich man.

09:09.982 --> 09:12.314
- What denomination?
- What denomination?

09:12.385 --> 09:16.116
How about three Puerto Ricans,
two Chinks and a Guinea?

09:16.188 --> 09:18.213
I don't care. Mix it up.
Whatever you want.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.452
What about a Swahili? Jesus.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.188
I don't know what that is either.
You're starting to upset me.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.389
You got your own chips, huh,
with your name on them?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.364
This is no joke.

09:27.433 --> 09:31.961
We used to use the
Bicycle poker chips...

09:32.038 --> 09:34.006
and then some kid started
sneaking in additional funds.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.201
- Who's that? Moyshe?
- No, no. Some kid up the block.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.141
Fuckin' Moyshe.

09:40.379 --> 09:44.611
- So that's a nice car you have there.
- Thanks. A Ferrari.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.949
Yeah. It's a 355,
six-speed transmission, right?

09:48.020 --> 09:51.751
Yeah. It's a synchromesh.
I love it. Nice.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.918
Yo, shit is yellow, B.
Rizzy's the color, nugga.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.258
Yellow's filthy. Come on.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.821
It's Big Bird mode.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.800
All right.
Place your bets.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.241
- Hey.
- You are late.

10:16.315 --> 10:20.274
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Your father is really upset.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.618
- He won't even tell me what it is.
- Jesus.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.289
- Hey.
- What's up, Seth?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.888
- How you doin'? How's school?
- It's all right.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.490
That's a good question, Seth.
You wanna tell us what happened?

10:35.568 --> 10:40.369
- We didn't know if you were comin'.
- Oh, yeah. Traffic was crazy.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.134
So?

10:42.208 --> 10:46.235
Do you wanna wait till after
dinner to talk about it?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.610
Yeah, let's eat first.

10:48.681 --> 10:53.812
- Answer the question, Seth.
- I dropped out.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.150
You wanna tell us why?

10:56.222 --> 11:01.182
Well, I gave it a year, Dad,
and it's just not for me.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.423
I see. So that means you've been
lying to us for six months.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.794
Six months, Seth.

11:05.865 --> 11:09.392
"School's fine, Dad.
My grades are good, Dad."

11:09.468 --> 11:13.427
Let's just leave that for a second.
So you dropped out.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.737
That means you haven't been getting
your student loan checks, right?

11:16.809 --> 11:20.404
Is that right? How are you making
the rent every month, Seth?

11:22.581 --> 11:26.073
I'm running a business,
and I'm just earning a living.

11:26.152 --> 11:30.919
Earning a living? This what
you call earning a living?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.981
- Marty, are those drugs?
- Yes.

11:33.059 --> 11:37.086
- Yes, those are drugs?
- No, Mom. This is an honest living.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.927
And you can ask any one
of my customers.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.365
What do you mean, "customers"?
Where's the customers?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.335
They're children of people
in this community.

11:44.403 --> 11:48.169
How do you think I got these?
Anyway, it's illegal.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.268
You're running a backdoor card game!
How do you think this reflects on me?

11:53.345 --> 11:57.179
I'm a judge,
for Christ's sake!

11:57.249 --> 12:01.345
Are you listening to me?

12:03.022 --> 12:06.514
<i>I'm gonna be honest with you.</i>
<i>You're runnin'a good business.</i>

12:06.592 --> 12:09.493
I think you're a smart kid,
pullin' in some real cash.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.123
But I gotta tell you, man,
this is risky fuckin' business.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.532
I mean, you really honestly plan
on dealing cards to college kids...

12:16.602 --> 12:18.695
when you're fuckin' 35?

12:18.771 --> 12:21.968
You don't think you'll get pinched
in the next couple years?

12:22.041 --> 12:26.808
Maybe it's time to start thinkin'
about down-the-line time.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.439
So, you want me
to come work for you?

12:31.517 --> 12:35.749
What? I guess it'll be like retribution
for me taking all your money here?

12:35.821 --> 12:38.813
First of all, I am not
done with you here, all right?

12:38.891 --> 12:40.950
And, no, you're only gonna
work for me a short time.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.926
You pass the Series Seven.

12:42.995 --> 12:46.453
You learn the ropes.
You're on your own.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.797
Yeah, ask Adam, man.
He'll tell you.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.030
- It's good.
- It's good?

12:52.104 --> 12:55.232
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be blunt.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.902
We're talkin' about
millions of dollars.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.745
<i>I was making</i>
<i>good money with the casino...</i>

13:43.823 --> 13:46.121
<i>but these guys</i>
<i>were macking it hard.</i>

13:46.192 --> 13:48.854
<i>That's the level</i>
<i>I wanted to be operating on.</i>

13:48.928 --> 13:52.489
<i>So I drove out</i>
<i>to Long Island, way out.</i>

13:52.565 --> 13:56.626
<i>The office was a good hour</i>
<i>away from Wall Street.</i>

13:56.702 --> 13:58.636
<i>Somebody forgot to tell the guys</i>
<i>who worked there, though.</i>

13:58.704 --> 14:00.365
<i>They looked and acted...</i>

14:00.439 --> 14:03.374
<i>like they took the Six train</i>
<i>to Fulton Street every morning.</i>

14:03.442 --> 14:04.932
<i>But it wasn't Wall Street.</i>

14:05.010 --> 14:07.672
<i>It was exit 53</i>
<i>on the Long Island Expressway...</i>

14:07.746 --> 14:11.147
<i>a good hour from</i>
<i>the New York Stock Exchange.</i>

14:22.595 --> 14:27.328
No, no, no, no. You don't wanna act now.
This stock is going to turn.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.959
I'm invested very heavily myself.
We just stay put.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.367
I don't know if you've ever had the
opportunity to purchase I.P.O. Before...

14:32.438 --> 14:34.633
but we have this company that's going
to market in about a week or so.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.403
We're gonna have to move on this now.
This is gonna happen next week.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.808
We don't wanna marry this stock.
We're in; we're out.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.780
What do you mean, you don't buy stock
over the phone? How do you do it?

14:42.848 --> 14:46.978
Smoke signals? Telepathy? World leaders
solve problems over the phone.

14:47.052 --> 14:52.012
I'm not a Charles Schwab.
I don't need your business; I value it.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.549
I'm successful to the point where
I don't need to chase your business.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.359
Hey, kid, get the fuck
outta here!

15:08.641 --> 15:10.165
Over here.

15:11.310 --> 15:15.076
- Have they started interviewing yet?
- No.

15:15.147 --> 15:19.743
- Know how long it's gonna be?
- You'll all be going in together.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.286
But I thought
this was, like, an interview?

15:22.354 --> 15:25.949
It is. It's a group interview.
You'll see.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.906
No, man.
You're a male.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.134
<i>Group interview, my ass.</i>

15:45.210 --> 15:47.838
<i>It was like a Hitler Youth rally,</i>
<i>in retrospect.</i>

15:47.913 --> 15:50.507
<i>The guy who pitched us, Jim Young,</i>
<i>was the head recruiter there.</i>

15:50.582 --> 15:54.985
- Okay, guys. Let's go.
- <i>Between him and Michael, honestly...</i>

15:55.054 --> 15:58.922
<i>they could sell bubble gum</i>
<i>in the lockjaw ward at Bellevue.</i>

16:09.868 --> 16:12.336
I'm sorry, man.
This is my seat.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.532
- Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. Don't worry about it.

16:17.810 --> 16:22.008
- Fuckin' dumb-ass.
- Get the fuck outta here.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.606
- What?
- Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.

16:25.684 --> 16:29.620
Just get your ass out of that Italian
leather chair and get the fuck out.

16:29.688 --> 16:33.385
Right now. Come on.
Let's go, schlepp rock.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.222
Out.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.023
Sit down.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.068
We expect everyone here to
treat their coworkers...

16:43.135 --> 16:45.194
with a certain level
of respect.

16:45.270 --> 16:50.333
Before we start, I have one question.
Has anyone passed a Series Seven exam?

16:50.409 --> 16:54.038
- I have a Series Seven license.
- Good for you. You can get out too.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.172
What? Why?

16:56.248 --> 16:59.081
We don't hire brokers here.
We train new ones.

16:59.151 --> 17:03.383
That's it, Skippy.
Pack your shit. Let's go.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.986
Okay. Here's the deal.

17:10.061 --> 17:13.828
I'm not here to waste your time.
I hope you're not here to waste mine.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.799
So I'm gonna keep this short.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.858
If you become an employee
of this firm...

17:17.935 --> 17:20.530
you will make your first million
within three years.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.198
Okay? I repeat that:

17:22.273 --> 17:26.108
You will make a million dollars
within three years...

17:26.178 --> 17:30.274
of your first day of employment
at J.T. Marlin.

17:30.349 --> 17:33.546
There is no question whether or not
you'll become a millionaire here.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.520
The only question
is how many times over.

17:36.588 --> 17:40.115
You think I'm joking?
I am not joking.

17:40.192 --> 17:44.026
I am a millionaire.
It's a weird thing to hear, right?

17:44.096 --> 17:46.792
I'll tell ya.
It's a weird thing to say.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.060
I am a fucking millionaire.

17:49.134 --> 17:52.228
And guess how old I am.
Twenty-seven.

17:52.304 --> 17:56.172
You know what that makes me here?
A fuckin' senior citizen.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.870
This firm is entirely comprised
of people your age, not mine.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.847
Lucky for me, I'm very fucking good
at my job, or I'd be out of one.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.908
You guys are the new blood.
You're gonna go home with the <i>kessef.</i>

18:06.985 --> 18:10.421
You are the future big swinging dicks
of this firm.

18:10.489 --> 18:14.482
Now, you all look money hungry,
and that's good.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.462
Anybody tells you money is the root
of all evil doesn't fuckin' have any.

18:18.530 --> 18:22.091
They say money can't buy happiness?
Look at the fuckin' smile on my face.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.762
Ear to ear, baby.
You want details? Fine.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.466
I drive a Ferrari
355 Cabriolet.

18:28.540 --> 18:33.603
What's up? I have a ridiculous house
in the South Fork.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.274
I have every toy you could imagine,
and best of all, kids...

18:37.349 --> 18:39.283
I am liquid.

18:39.351 --> 18:43.788
So, now you know what's possible.
Let me tell you what's required.

18:43.856 --> 18:48.293
You are required to work
your fucking ass off at this firm.

18:48.360 --> 18:53.127
We want winners here, not pikers.
A piker walks at the bell.

18:53.198 --> 18:57.635
A piker asks how much vacation you get
in the first year. Vacation?

18:57.703 --> 19:01.036
People come and work at this firm
for one reason: To become filthy rich.

19:01.106 --> 19:05.543
We're not here to make friends.
We're not savin' the manatees, guys.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.876
You want vacation time?
Go teach third grade, public school.

19:14.620 --> 19:18.818
Okay. The first three months
at the firm are as a trainee.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.119
You make $150 a week.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.355
After you're done training,
you take the Series Seven.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.895
Pass that, you become junior broker...

19:24.963 --> 19:26.624
and you open accounts
for your team leader.

19:26.698 --> 19:30.395
You open 40 accounts, you start
workin' for yourself. Sky's the limit.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.902
Word about being a trainee.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.235
Friends, parents, other brokers,
they're gonna give you shit.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.538
It's true. $150 a week?
Not a lot of money.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.508
Pay them no mind.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.911
You need to learn this business,
and this is the time to do it.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.848
Once you pass the test,
none of that's gonna matter.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.977
Your friends are shit.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.681
Tell them you made 25 grand last month,
they're won't fucking believe you.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.122
Fuck them! Fuck 'em!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.855
Parents don't like the life you lead?
"Fuck you, Mom and Dad."

19:56.929 --> 20:01.366
See how it feels when you're makin'
their fuckin' Lexus payments.

20:01.433 --> 20:05.028
Now, go home and think about it.
Think about whether it's really for you.

20:05.103 --> 20:08.561
If you decide it isn't...
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.736
It's not for everyone.
Thanks.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.974
But if you
really want this...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.540
you call me on Monday
and we'll talk.

20:19.618 --> 20:23.213
Just don't
waste my fuckin' time.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.449
Okay. That's it.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.061
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:14.139 --> 21:17.267
So, what's up?

21:17.342 --> 21:21.972
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?

21:22.047 --> 21:27.417
I feel bad about the way things went
at the house last week.

21:28.553 --> 21:32.421
I just don't feel like we get
anywhere when we talk at home.

21:32.491 --> 21:36.291
Well, I don't know
that there's anything to talk about.

21:36.361 --> 21:40.297
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- No. I'm fine, thanks.

21:40.365 --> 21:43.129
You dropped out
of school, Seth.

21:43.201 --> 21:46.398
You're running an illegal casino
out of your apartment.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.202
You're putting my career at risk.
What is there to talk about, Seth?

21:50.275 --> 21:55.144
Well, I don't know why
we can't just discuss this. I mean...

21:55.213 --> 21:57.272
Maybe you're just not
seeing my side.

21:57.349 --> 22:00.716
Your side? What side?
You're doing wrong.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.981
I'm not your best friend.
That's your mother's racket.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.523
I'm your father.
I tell you when you screw up.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.491
What did you think I was gonna do?
Pat you on the back for the casino idea?

22:08.560 --> 22:11.085
Tell you what
a great entrepreneur you are?

22:12.297 --> 22:14.629
So what do you want me
to do, Seth?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.431
I mean, my God, if I'd called my father
to meet me for a cup of coffee...

22:18.503 --> 22:21.529
to talk about my screwups,
he probably would've laughed.

22:21.606 --> 22:24.302
We didn't have nice little chats
about why I was a bad boy.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.207
I got smacked.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.076
And I didn't do it again.
Much simpler.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.548
Look. I'm just trying to restore
what's left of our relationship.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.710
"Relationship"?

22:34.786 --> 22:38.017
What the fuck are you
talking about, relationship?

22:38.290 --> 22:40.520
What? Are we dating?

22:40.592 --> 22:42.719
I'm not your girlfriend Seth;
I'm your father.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.092
Clean up your life,
make an honest living...

22:45.163 --> 22:48.860
and then you and I can talk
like normal people, all right?

23:16.361 --> 23:19.421
- Hey, Seth.
- Hi. How you doin'?

23:19.498 --> 23:23.798
- Abby.
- Oh, yeah. I know. I forgot.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.133
It's okay. I never told you.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.570
Besides, the other day
you looked a little frazzled...

23:28.640 --> 23:31.871
so I didn't think
you'd remember anyway.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.040
- Today's my first day.
- No shit?

23:36.114 --> 23:38.844
Yeah.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.283
- See ya.
- See ya.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.424
No, that's not how it works.

23:49.494 --> 23:52.725
If I was asking you to
own 5,000 or 10,000 shares...

23:52.798 --> 23:55.892
of some pink-sheet, bullshit company
with negative earnings...

23:55.967 --> 23:57.764
I'd tell you
to hang up the phone...

23:57.836 --> 24:00.669
call your local broker
and short the stock.

24:00.739 --> 24:05.574
I wouldn't expect your business.
But, Don, I am bringing you...

24:05.644 --> 24:10.240
Seth. Seth. Come over here.
It's not your table.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.682
...F.D.A. Landmark approval.
It's, like, the cancer pill.

24:13.752 --> 24:19.054
No. It's a cancer pill.
No, Don, it's not Propecia P.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.821
It is the cancer pill.
Oh, Donald, please take a chance.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.021
You look pretty.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.462
Thank you.

24:27.532 --> 24:30.695
So you wanna tell me where the fuck
you were last night?

24:30.769 --> 24:34.068
- Not particularly.
- Okay.

24:39.544 --> 24:42.104
This is for you.

24:42.180 --> 24:47.675
I don't know how to better
explain this to you, but...

24:49.488 --> 24:51.547
it's over.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.524
Okay. I disagree.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.990
- Hang on a second.
- Here you go.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.959
- What's up? Is he in?
- I don't know.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.370
Hey. These are the D&B cards.
These are our leads.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.743
- Morning.
- Every card is an opportunity, right?

25:15.814 --> 25:19.215
These are good leads.
People on these cards buy stock.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.582
Your job is to call them
and get them interested in the firm.

25:21.653 --> 25:24.417
You're not actually selling stock yet,
but you're selling the dream.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.423
So get 'em wet. Tell 'em
that in a month from now...

25:26.491 --> 25:30.052
a senior broker's gonna
call them back with an idea.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.618
So who are these people?

25:31.696 --> 25:34.062
Average client's 45 years old,
from the Midwest...

25:34.132 --> 25:37.898
$150,000 annual income,
1 million net, has a local broker...

25:37.969 --> 25:41.097
but loves a hotshot New Yorker
who sounds good on the phone.

25:41.172 --> 25:44.608
So the card won't tell you that. It only
has name, address and occupation.

25:44.676 --> 25:48.237
So you gotta
feel 'em out, see?

25:48.313 --> 25:51.680
"Peter Davis, Vice President,
Parks Telecommunications."

25:51.750 --> 25:53.684
The guy's probably
a fuckin' whale.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.449
So feel 'im out, see what he's got.
Truth is, it doesn't matter these days.

25:57.522 --> 26:00.582
With the Dow where it is now,
everybody wants a piece of the market.

26:00.659 --> 26:04.288
I can close anyone anytime anywhere.
Just give me a phone number.

26:04.362 --> 26:07.092
- Greg, I have John Duncklee on three.
- Not now. I'll call him back.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.929
Now, once you qualify the guy,
you send him a press packet.

26:10.001 --> 26:13.459
It'll be easy, and it'll get you
comfortable on the phone, which is key.

26:13.538 --> 26:17.770
This entire business revolves
around the phone. Play the numbers.

26:17.842 --> 26:21.300
This is a contact sport. The more people
you contact, the better you'll do.

26:21.379 --> 26:26.078
- A good broker makes 700 calls a day.
- What's the phone bill like?

26:26.151 --> 26:28.619
This month
was approaching 400,000.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.520
Listen to me. Even though
you're not selling stock yet...

26:31.590 --> 26:34.991
I want you to remember the code
we have here, okay?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.994
- Did you see <i>Glengarry Glen Ross?</i>
- Yeah.

26:37.062 --> 26:40.190
- Do you remember "ABC"?
- Yeah. "Always be closing."

26:40.265 --> 26:42.893
That's right. "Always be closing."
"Telling's not selling."

26:42.968 --> 26:47.428
That's the attitude you wanna have.
There's two rules as a trainee.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.440
Number one:
We don't pitch the bitch here.

26:50.508 --> 26:51.839
What?

26:51.910 --> 26:54.310
We don't sell stock to women.
I don't care who it is; we don't do it.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.210
Nancy Sinatra calls,
you tell her you're sorry.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.873
They're a constant pain
in the ass...

26:57.949 --> 26:59.940
and you're never
gonna hear the end of it.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.578
They'll call you every fucking day
wanting to know why the stock dropped.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.383
And God forbid
the stock should go up.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.481
You're gonna hear
from them every 15 minutes.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.755
It's just not worth it.
Don't pitch the bitch.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.989
Number two:
Don't write wood, all right?

27:12.063 --> 27:14.759
A lot of trainees are so anxious
to get off the phone...

27:14.833 --> 27:17.233
that they just steamroll the guy
into getting the press packet...

27:17.302 --> 27:18.633
so they can hang up.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.000
Then I call back, and I'm, like...

27:20.071 --> 27:22.232
"Hi. You spoke to a junior
associate of mine last month."

27:22.307 --> 27:25.242
And he's like, "Not interested. Bye."
That's a shitty lead, okay?

27:25.310 --> 27:28.609
That's fucking wood.
The info we send is bullshit, all right?

27:28.680 --> 27:32.582
The most important part is telling them
you have that one great idea...

27:32.651 --> 27:34.949
and that a senior broker's
gonna call them back in a month.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.148
This way they don't think
we just fire off a million recos a day.

27:38.223 --> 27:39.656
We don't want clients thinkin'...

27:39.724 --> 27:41.715
you're pitching something
you read in the <i>Journal,</i> right?

27:41.793 --> 27:43.818
- Yeah. Right.
- Okay, so no wood.

27:43.895 --> 27:47.160
- I'm serious. No wood.
- All right. Take it easy.

27:47.232 --> 27:52.135
Hey, don't even start
that fuckin' shit with me, okay?

27:52.203 --> 27:55.070
I'm tryin' to tell you what's expected
of you and what your job is.

27:55.140 --> 27:59.270
I'm tryin' to make the job easier, okay?
Don't give me any fuckin' lip.

27:59.344 --> 28:03.007
Okay. Okay, so, fine.

28:03.081 --> 28:06.915
What happens if the guy
wants to buy stock right then?

28:06.985 --> 28:10.386
Now you're talkin'. You wanna go
into every call expecting just that.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.753
If somebody wants a recommendation,
put the guy on hold...

28:12.824 --> 28:15.622
stand up and yell "reco"
at the top of your lungs.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.720
First senior broker who gets
on the horn gets the sale.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.061
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

28:21.132 --> 28:26.160
Okay. That suit's dog shit.
Get a new suit.

28:26.237 --> 28:29.070
No, Ma. I told you.
No, I'm not a broker yet.

28:29.140 --> 28:32.303
I'm a trainee. I still have
to pass my Series Seven test.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.901
<i>Please.</i>
<i>You're a stockbroker.</i>

28:33.978 --> 28:36.538
You wear a suit to work
every day, don't you?

28:37.916 --> 28:41.943
- Yeah.
- So, what are we arguing about?

28:42.020 --> 28:44.750
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're doing great, Seth.

28:44.823 --> 28:47.849
You're working your way up
from the bottom. Never easy.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.757
What did Dad say about it?

28:49.828 --> 28:53.423
<i>He's very happy.</i>
<i>Shocked, but very happy.</i>

28:53.498 --> 28:57.059
- He's waiting for you to call him.
- Why doesn't he call me?

28:57.135 --> 29:01.128
- <i>One miracle at a time, okay, sweetie?</i>
- All right.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.708
- <i>Mom?</i>
- <i>I'm in bed.</i>

29:14.385 --> 29:18.082
- How you doin'?
- Hi, baby. How was work?

29:18.189 --> 29:21.955
I know you're not at home with a bag
of cash, waiting for me to call you.

29:22.026 --> 29:24.654
But I'm not some 18-year old selling
the cure for Al DS. I am 46 years old.

29:24.729 --> 29:28.563
I have 22 years of market experience.
I know this business.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.625
So pick up your skirt, grab your balls
and let's make some money.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.331
Here you go, Greg.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.897
I hope this is better
than the last batch of shit you gave me.

29:37.976 --> 29:41.412
- Produced more wood than Ron Jeremy.
- What?

29:41.479 --> 29:45.813
I don't want you to yell "reco" anymore.
Know what you should yell? "Timber!"

29:45.884 --> 29:48.512
Yeah. Mr. Fuckin' Wood.
I hear you fuckin' makin' your calls.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.554
It's bullshit, all right?

29:50.622 --> 29:53.386
If you want them off the phone so bad,
why don't you just hang up?

29:53.458 --> 29:55.551
You should get them excited.
You know, excited?

29:55.627 --> 29:58.687
They should beg for a broker
on the first call. Shit.

29:58.763 --> 30:03.496
Yeah. Howard Young, please.
Seth Davis over at J.T. Marlin.

30:03.568 --> 30:07.060
- No, he's not expecting my call.
- No. Tsk.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.333
- Okay. Yeah. I'll call you.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.

30:09.407 --> 30:10.772
Hang up the phone.

30:10.842 --> 30:13.436
Thank you. That's nice
for you to do that for me.

30:13.511 --> 30:16.639
First of all, there's gonna be a lot of
these regardless of how good you are...

30:16.714 --> 30:19.478
but you happen to suck big,
fat-ass rhinoceros dick.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.781
Well, thank you.
That's confidence-inspiring.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.946
I got this friend who runs this
other firm, right?

30:24.022 --> 30:26.786
He hands out
this book to new trainees.

30:26.858 --> 30:29.793
It's called a rebuttal book.
It looks like a little Filofax.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.625
It's got these index tabs,
but instead of having letters...

30:32.697 --> 30:36.394
like "A" to "B," "G" to "H,"
it has different things like...

30:36.467 --> 30:38.492
"My wife won't let me"...

30:38.570 --> 30:41.300
or "I'm not in the market now"
or "Send me a prospectus."

30:41.372 --> 30:43.306
It has a rebuttal
for any excuse.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.365
Anyway, that's stuff
you'll have to learn later.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.173
The most important thing
you gotta know right now...

30:48.246 --> 30:50.714
is that you can be whoever
you wanna be on the phone.

30:50.782 --> 30:54.616
You know what I'm sayin'? Who cares?
Do what you gotta do.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.917
Change your last name.
Say you're the fuckin' vice president.

30:57.989 --> 31:01.186
You know? Who cares?
Just get the cocksucker on the line.

31:01.259 --> 31:05.161
Yeah, but how can I do shit like that?
Isn't there a compliance officer here?

31:05.230 --> 31:07.926
No. No, man. Everybody does that shit.
Are you kidding?

31:07.999 --> 31:09.626
I mean, even on Wall Street.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.101
You talking about John there?
That guy works for us.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.071
The guy's a fuckin' chimp. Look at him.
The only compliance work...

31:15.139 --> 31:18.438
he's doin' is makin' sure my lunch
is still hot when it gets here.

31:18.509 --> 31:23.003
He's only here because the S.E.C.
Requires it. Easiest job in the world.

31:23.081 --> 31:26.414
Look. I think he's actually
masturbating right now.

31:33.491 --> 31:38.190
- Stay the fuck away from her.
- Yeah.

31:39.430 --> 31:42.797
Holy shit, you slut.
You made the call.

31:42.867 --> 31:46.633
No, no. Don't you dare. Get your
filthy one-race paws off my money.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.501
What'd you bet me?
A month's commission?

31:48.573 --> 31:51.201
- Yeah, and yours too, kid.
- How do you get away with this?

31:51.276 --> 31:53.437
'Cause I'm a Jew,
and I have the mind of a champion.

31:53.511 --> 31:54.876
See this?

31:54.946 --> 31:59.383
Here, kid.
Go get a tan and some Rogaine.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.385
- Watch out for this.
- Fuckin' A.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.889
The only bookie in New York
that delivers FedEx.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.629
When are you gonna
take the test, Seth?

32:12.697 --> 32:15.996
Well, you know, after
the training program's over.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.627
They want you to get a good idea
of how things work there...

32:18.703 --> 32:21.797
before you take the Series Seven,
but it's a great system.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.273
- I'm really learning a lot.
- Are you gonna be rich, Seth?

32:24.342 --> 32:27.675
- Oh, God willing.
- I hope so.

32:27.745 --> 32:30.714
How come I've
never heard of this firm?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.512
I don't know.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.347
It's a smaller firm, I guess.

32:35.420 --> 32:38.116
There's a million others like it
you probably never heard of.

32:38.189 --> 32:41.420
The reason I ask is 'cause I would've
thought that you would've...

32:41.492 --> 32:45.622
joined a firm like Goldman Sachs
or something of that stature.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.689
- Marty, what are you starting for?
- What?

32:48.766 --> 32:53.430
No, no. Ma, it's okay.
The reason is, Dad...

32:53.504 --> 32:56.996
that the larger houses don't really like
to hire kids straight out of college...

32:57.075 --> 33:00.044
you know, unless you went
to an Ivy League school...

33:00.111 --> 33:04.104
or you wanna do cash-flow analysis
for the next 15 years.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.309
They usually like you
to work...

33:08.386 --> 33:12.447
outside their firm for a few years
to get a good sense of the marketplace.

33:12.523 --> 33:17.153
But most all brokers usually start out
in little firms like J.T. Marlin.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.928
That's great. See? He answered
the question. That was easy.

33:25.703 --> 33:29.901
So all you have to do
is close the casino, right?

33:31.743 --> 33:36.180
Marty,
we talked about this.

33:36.247 --> 33:40.047
- What are you giving me looks for?
- Didn't we talk about this?

33:40.118 --> 33:43.144
- What? I just...
- It was a celebration.

33:43.221 --> 33:48.523
You know what?
I gotta go meet somebody.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.391
I love you, Ma.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.987
See ya.
See ya later.

33:54.065 --> 33:56.556
Nice job, Marty.

34:03.474 --> 34:07.911
<i>Originally, I got in for the cash.</i>
<i>But getting my dad's respect...</i>

34:07.979 --> 34:09.913
<i>That's what kept me there.</i>

34:09.981 --> 34:14.315
<i>So he took some parting shots from time</i>
<i>to time. Whatever. I didn't care.</i>

34:14.385 --> 34:16.649
<i>Not really.</i>

34:16.721 --> 34:19.554
<i>Anyway, the point is,</i>
<i>I had to adapt to this new world.</i>

34:19.623 --> 34:21.284
<i>I didn't really know these guys.</i>

34:21.359 --> 34:25.193
<i>What I did know is that they had</i>
<i>all the money in the world...</i>

34:25.263 --> 34:28.061
<i>and not a clue</i>
<i>what to do with it.</i>

35:03.334 --> 35:05.825
Seth, what's up, man?

35:05.903 --> 35:08.394
- <i>Wait outside.</i>
- Hey, man.

35:08.473 --> 35:11.169
Thought you weren't gonna make it, man.
Sit down. Grab a slice. Have a beer.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.334
What's up?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.469
You think he fucked
Hannah or Sheen fucked her?

35:14.545 --> 35:16.809
- Both of 'em.
- Did he just move in?

35:16.881 --> 35:21.250
- He's been here eight months.
- <i>Life all comes down to a few moments.</i>

35:21.319 --> 35:25.415
"This is one of 'em."
Sheen was kind of a pimp.

35:25.490 --> 35:28.425
Shut up, man. Listen. Gecko's coming on.
"What the hell's goin' on?"

35:28.493 --> 35:32.930
I'm lookin' at 200,000 shares moved.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

35:32.997 --> 35:36.330
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down
and eat your lunch. Back in two, Alex.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.496
Look. I loved it at forty.
Fifty? It's an insult.

35:40.571 --> 35:43.267
Their analysts? They don't know
a preferred stock from livestock.

35:43.341 --> 35:46.401
They wait till it goes down,
and like gumdrops and sperm counts...

35:48.613 --> 35:53.107
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days
in a row. Wants to be a player.

35:53.184 --> 35:56.847
Oughta be a picture of you in the
dictionary under "persistent," kid.

35:56.921 --> 36:00.186
Yeah? Now, listen, Jerry, I'm
looking for negative control.

36:00.258 --> 36:01.725
No more than 30, 35 percent.

36:01.792 --> 36:04.454
Just enough to block
anybody else's merger plans...

36:04.529 --> 36:06.861
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

36:06.931 --> 36:11.595
Looks this good on paper, we're
in the kill zone, pal. Lock and load.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.069
Lunch? You gotta be kidding.
Lunch is for wimps.

36:14.138 --> 36:17.301
Okay, Fidel,
I'll talk at you.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.468
Very good.

36:19.544 --> 36:23.173
How do you do, Mr. Gekko?
Bud Fox.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.546
So you say, "Nice to meet you."
Hope you're intelligent.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.710
Where'd you get these?

36:28.786 --> 36:31.949
- I got a connection at the airport.
- Nice job, Mr. Clean.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.719
Hey. Get the fuck off me.

36:36.627 --> 36:41.087
- <i>I'm really busy, Seth.</i>
- No. Look, I understand, Doctor.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.655
<i>I'm really busy here myself.</i>

36:42.733 --> 36:45.759
We're gonna come back to you
in one month with one idea only.

36:45.836 --> 36:49.772
If you like what we have to say, great.
We'll do business. If not...

36:49.840 --> 36:52.968
<i>I mean, worst-case scenario, you'll hear</i>
<i>yourself a new business idea...</i>

36:53.044 --> 36:56.912
- That X ray is useless.
- We'll part as friends, right?

36:56.981 --> 36:57.675
What?

36:57.748 --> 36:59.978
Are you working with a million
dollars in the market now?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.040
Who is this?

37:01.118 --> 37:05.020
You're a doctor. Have you heard
of a drug called Phenodryl?

37:05.089 --> 37:07.353
<i>It's being manufactured</i>
<i>by M.S.C. Pharmaceuticals.</i>

37:07.425 --> 37:08.449
No.

37:08.526 --> 37:12.963
Well, listen, okay? It's in the
third stage of F.D.A. Approval.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.965
<i>Word is it's gonna be approved</i>
<i>within the next three months...</i>

37:16.033 --> 37:18.024
<i>and it could be tomorrow</i>
<i>for all I know.</i>

37:18.102 --> 37:21.503
But, you know,
I'm getting ahead of myself...

37:21.572 --> 37:24.439
and you're real busy over there...

37:24.508 --> 37:26.271
<i>so why don't I just send you out</i>
<i>the information...</i>

37:26.344 --> 37:29.643
Wait, wait, wait.
Forget the info.

37:29.714 --> 37:32.581
<i>Let's talk about this now.</i>

37:32.650 --> 37:34.140
What was the name
of that drug again?

37:34.218 --> 37:36.948
Could you hold on
for one second?

37:37.021 --> 37:39.046
<i>I'm gonna get...</i>

37:39.123 --> 37:42.217
a senior broker who's a little more
familiar with that particular stock.

37:42.293 --> 37:45.888
All right? Hold on a second.
One second.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.262
Reco!

38:01.345 --> 38:04.974
- Got it.
- Sorry.

38:05.049 --> 38:08.416
His name's Dr. Jacobs,
and I'd say that he's definitely...

38:08.486 --> 38:10.613
- Whoa. I don't wanna hear it, kid.
- Okay.

38:12.356 --> 38:15.655
Hi, Dr. Jacobs?
This is Chris Marlin at J.T. Marlin.

38:15.726 --> 38:19.184
- Marlin?
- <i>Right. He's my father.</i>

38:19.263 --> 38:21.527
My associate tells me you're interested
in one of our stocks.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.193
<i>Your wife's on three.</i>
<i>I will call her back.</i>

38:24.268 --> 38:26.634
<i>Yes. M.S.C. Sounds like</i>
<i>it might be interesting.</i>

38:26.704 --> 38:28.194
Might be?

38:28.272 --> 38:32.368
"Might be" doesn't sell stock at the
rate M.S.C.'s going for it, Dr. Jacobs.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.105
- We're talking very high volume.
- <i>I still have to run it by my people.</i>

38:35.179 --> 38:38.842
That's great, Doc, if you wanna miss
yet another opportunity here...

38:38.916 --> 38:41.214
and watch your colleagues
get rich doing clinical trials.

38:41.285 --> 38:44.448
- Don't buy a share and hang up.
- <i>Hold on a second.</i>

38:44.522 --> 38:48.185
- <i>I just want to talk about it more.</i>
- Honestly, I don't have the time.

38:48.259 --> 38:52.093
This stock is blowing up right now.
The whole firm's going nuts.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.621
Hold on. Let me open up
the door to my office.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.993
Oh, my God!

39:00.071 --> 39:03.632
See that, Doc?
That's my trading floor.

39:03.708 --> 39:07.667
I have calls to make to a million other
doctors who are already in the know.

39:07.745 --> 39:11.579
I can't walk you through this right now.
I'm sorry.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.979
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Let's do this.</i>

39:20.057 --> 39:25.188
Since you're a new account, I can't go
higher than 2,000 shares. I'm sorry.

39:25.262 --> 39:31.167
2,000? Are you nuts? That is way
beyond what I was thinking. 2,000?

39:31.235 --> 39:33.169
Jesus!

39:35.206 --> 39:37.800
Listen. I'm curious. Why can't you
sell me any more than that?

39:37.875 --> 39:40.400
Well, we like to establish a
relationship with our clients...

39:40.478 --> 39:44.881
on something small before we get
to the more serious trades.

39:44.949 --> 39:49.409
Let me show you several
percentage points on this small trade...

39:49.487 --> 39:51.421
and then we'll talk
about doing future business.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.549
That sounds good.
Give me the 2,000 shares.

39:54.625 --> 39:58.755
- Done.
- You sure you can't do better on this?

39:58.829 --> 40:01.889
- I'm sorry, Dr. Jacobs. I can't.
- All right.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.298
- We'll start with this trade, then.
- Great. I promise...

40:04.368 --> 40:06.427
we'll swing for the fences
on the next one.

40:06.504 --> 40:10.304
Do you want that confirmation
sent to your office or your mansion?

40:10.374 --> 40:13.537
<i>Very funny,</i>
<i>Mr. Marlin.</i>

40:13.611 --> 40:17.069
Let me put my secretary on,
and she'll take down your info.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.345
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.080
Done and done.

40:27.725 --> 40:29.625
Yeah, baby!

40:32.496 --> 40:35.158
- So, why'd you put a max on his buy?
- What?

40:35.232 --> 40:37.700
Why'd you put a max on his buy?

40:37.768 --> 40:39.633
You didn't tell him
how it works?

40:39.703 --> 40:43.571
He's a trainee. He doesn't need
to know initial sell limits.

40:43.641 --> 40:48.203
Make sure he shows you the ropes, kid.
He's too busy callin' his bookie.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.510
Fuckin' Hebrews. Always lookin' out
for themselves and never the trainees.

40:51.582 --> 40:54.813
- Hey, hey.
- Why don't you go back to Little Italy?

40:54.885 --> 40:59.288
Go make me a latke, dreidel boy.
Abrams, look me up on the board.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.190
The reason I capped him
is in case he's a piker.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.319
See, we're gonna front the money
for this sale...

41:05.396 --> 41:08.627
and if he doesn't send the check,
I'm the one holding the bag, follow me?

41:08.699 --> 41:09.563
Right.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.761
Last commission month, the kid on Jim's
team wrote a million-dollar ticket.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.829
Stock was down 31/2 points
by settlement.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.931
Fuckin' kid took
a 1/4 million-dollar hit.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.340
- Shit.
- You know how much that hurts?

41:20.411 --> 41:23.847
Besides, the first sell
just whets the appetite.

41:23.914 --> 41:27.145
If he's a whale...
which it looks like he is...

41:27.218 --> 41:30.085
then I'll get him on a day
when there's a real rip.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.644
What's a rip?

41:31.722 --> 41:34.782
A commission.
That's why we work here.

41:34.859 --> 41:36.918
We make huge rips.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.430
No, I don't... I still
don't know how it works.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.295
Okay.

41:42.366 --> 41:46.166
A two-dollar rip, which is unheard of
anywhere on Wall Street...

41:46.237 --> 41:49.570
means that we're walkin' away...

41:49.640 --> 41:53.940
with two dollars
for every share we sell.

41:54.011 --> 41:57.037
Real money.
That's opportunity.

41:57.114 --> 41:59.742
Jesus, Greg, you show him
where the bathroom is yet?

41:59.817 --> 42:02.718
Yeah, Seth, I showed you
where Chris's desk is, right?

42:02.786 --> 42:06.517
- Richie, do something with this...
- How does Michael afford that?

42:08.325 --> 42:10.919
- Couldn't tell you.
- Okay.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.759
If he's doin' it, he's makin' money
on it. Point is:

42:13.831 --> 42:16.391
Service your client right,
and he'll be back for more.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.095
Show him a three-percent return...

42:19.169 --> 42:21.467
and he'll trust you to
watch his kids for the weekend.

42:33.751 --> 42:35.685
- Abby.
- Hey, Seth.

42:35.753 --> 42:39.712
- Hi.
- You wanna go get yourself a drink?

42:39.790 --> 42:42.384
Yeah.
You want anything?

42:42.459 --> 42:45.053
Oh. Okay.

42:52.870 --> 42:56.033
I thought this was supposed to
be a big broker hangout.

42:56.106 --> 43:00.509
Merrill Lynch. Salomon Brothers.
Mad, big-dick Steve. What is this place?

43:00.578 --> 43:03.809
This looks like the fucking
Christmas party at Mutual of Omaha.

43:03.881 --> 43:07.078
Yo, check this out.
Joe.

43:07.151 --> 43:10.484
Oh, my God. Would you
look at these monkeys?

43:10.554 --> 43:14.149
So, who do you live with?

43:14.224 --> 43:17.387
You mean, is the little black girl here
takin' care of her grandma...

43:17.461 --> 43:19.554
'cause her mama's
a crackhead?

43:19.630 --> 43:22.292
Yeah, exactly. I thought
it was smack, though.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.926
Right.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.334
Boy, you gotta get ahold
of that edge. It's kinda sharp.

43:29.406 --> 43:33.308
I know. It's just that
I get so much shit at J. <i>T...</i>

43:33.377 --> 43:36.278
that sometimes I have
to get in that mode just to...

43:36.347 --> 43:38.907
fend them off of me, you know?

43:38.983 --> 43:43.113
Yeah, I was gonna ask you
why are you there...

43:43.187 --> 43:45.985
because it doesn't seem like the ideal
working environment for a black woman.

43:46.056 --> 43:48.320
No, it isn't. It's just that...

43:48.392 --> 43:51.327
how many secretaries do you know
that make 80 grand a year?

43:51.395 --> 43:54.193
- One.
- Exactly.

43:55.332 --> 43:59.268
- "No, no, no. I gotta call the boss."
- Look at this guy. Check it.

43:59.336 --> 44:01.964
No way.
Vito Corleone.

44:02.039 --> 44:03.700
You don't come all my life...

44:03.774 --> 44:06.641
and then you show up
at my daughter's confirmation.

44:06.710 --> 44:09.577
"Are you standin' up or sittin' down?"
By that time l...

44:09.647 --> 44:13.378
- How you doin'?
- What's up?

44:13.450 --> 44:16.886
- You guys lookin' for a broker?
- Who the fuck are you?

44:16.954 --> 44:19.388
- Easy.
- I'm not doin' anything.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.515
I thought maybe you were lookin'
for somebody to invest with.

44:21.592 --> 44:25.358
- No. Yeah, we're fine. We are brokers.
- You are?

44:25.429 --> 44:29.331
- Yeah.
- You guys with Jacoby & Jacoby?

44:29.400 --> 44:33.131
- J.T. Marlin.
- Never heard of it.

44:33.203 --> 44:36.070
Hold on a second. Who are you?
What do you sell? Car insurance?

44:36.140 --> 44:39.906
We're with this little firm downtown.
Maybe you've heard of us.J.P. Morgan?

44:39.977 --> 44:43.469
- And I'm a black Negro.
- Right.

44:43.547 --> 44:47.005
I know J.T. It's a fuckin' chop shop.
They named it so it sounds like ours.

44:47.084 --> 44:49.678
He knows that firm.
It's a fuckin' chop shop.

44:49.753 --> 44:53.621
They named the firm to sound
like his. What is he, fucking Yogi Biz?

44:53.691 --> 44:57.058
- Shut the fuck up.
- We're not buying it.

44:57.127 --> 45:01.393
And what the fuck is with the suits?
You look like you're on Gotti's crew.

45:01.465 --> 45:04.730
- You look great. Seriously.
- Do you know who you're talkin' to?

45:04.802 --> 45:06.997
- Who are we talkin' to?
- You don't know?

45:07.071 --> 45:08.663
Here's Vito and John Jr.

45:08.739 --> 45:11.333
I don't wanna get involved in this.
We're not bothering you.

45:11.408 --> 45:15.504
We're not.
Patrick, call out the police. Come on!

45:16.880 --> 45:20.247
It's my dad
that's the mess...

45:20.317 --> 45:24.481
but that's not
really interesting conversation.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.614
What about you?

45:26.690 --> 45:32.560
Single mother. No money.
And now I take care of her.

45:32.629 --> 45:37.692
- What's wrong?
- She's got chronic pneumonia.

45:37.768 --> 45:40.760
You know, she smoked for, like,
15 years, and now she's really sick.

45:40.838 --> 45:43.033
And it's...

45:43.107 --> 45:46.907
She's just really happy that I have
this job so I can support both of us.

45:46.977 --> 45:51.038
- But it's scary sometimes, you know?
- Yeah.

45:52.549 --> 45:55.211
What about your father?

45:55.285 --> 45:58.914
I don't wanna talk
about my father either.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.922
Ready?

46:11.602 --> 46:14.435
<i>- Tell me a story.</i>
<i>- What do you wanna hear?</i>

46:14.505 --> 46:18.441
I don't know. Tell me...
Tell me a story about your dad.

46:19.810 --> 46:22.643
Well, I have
so many great ones.

46:22.713 --> 46:25.807
Go on. Tell me.

46:27.951 --> 46:30.385
All right.

46:32.256 --> 46:35.054
Well, I'm ten years old...

46:36.126 --> 46:39.289
and I just
got this new bike.

46:39.363 --> 46:42.457
It's a silver Mongoose,
you know, like BMX.

46:42.533 --> 46:48.438
And I'm skidding out in this puddle
like Starsky and Hutch.

46:48.505 --> 46:52.168
- Right.
- And my foot slips...

46:52.242 --> 46:56.872
and the pedal spins around
hard enough to break my leg.

46:56.947 --> 46:58.881
- Oh, my God.
- But I don't fall off the bike.

46:58.949 --> 47:04.285
- I keep going down this hill.
- And I get really scared, you know?

47:04.354 --> 47:07.187
So I jumped off the bike...

47:07.257 --> 47:09.782
and I landed
behind this parked car.

47:09.860 --> 47:15.321
And I was laying there
for a good half hour.

47:15.399 --> 47:17.424
And finally...

47:17.501 --> 47:21.164
I hear my father's voice up the street,
and he's calling my name.

47:21.238 --> 47:23.798
And I was so happy...

47:23.874 --> 47:26.240
that he was coming
to get me.

47:26.310 --> 47:31.373
And he comes around the car,
and he sees me lying there.

47:31.448 --> 47:34.417
I mean, there was...
there was blood everywhere.

47:34.484 --> 47:36.884
Anyway,
I look up at him...

47:36.954 --> 47:41.891
and for the first time in my life,
I see how much my father loved me.

47:43.227 --> 47:46.663
- 'Cause he was completely frozen.
- Wow.

47:46.730 --> 47:50.257
You know, it hurt him to see me
in that much pain.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.826
So he leans down
over me...

47:55.405 --> 47:57.669
and he slaps me
across the face.

47:57.741 --> 48:01.734
What? Why?

48:01.812 --> 48:04.337
I don't know.

48:06.116 --> 48:10.678
Maybe he was mad at me for
making him feel that helpless...

48:10.754 --> 48:15.453
or it was the only thing
he could think of.

48:15.525 --> 48:17.925
I don't really care
anymore.

48:17.995 --> 48:22.193
What I think of now is the look
on his face when he saw me lying there.

48:24.301 --> 48:26.929
And that's what I remember.

48:29.106 --> 48:31.404
That's what I miss.

48:37.314 --> 48:39.942
There's your story.

48:41.018 --> 48:43.213
Sorry.

48:46.290 --> 48:48.952
All right. I wanna talk
to you guys about appearance.

48:49.026 --> 48:53.224
Okay? Because most of you
dress like shit.

48:53.297 --> 48:55.390
I don't know what
your financial situation is...

48:55.465 --> 48:58.832
and I don't want to, but you gotta get
yourself at least one decent suit...

48:58.902 --> 49:02.895
because we have a minimum level
of aesthetic professionalism here...

49:02.973 --> 49:04.634
that we have to maintain.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.676
In three months, you can outfit
your whole closet...

49:06.743 --> 49:08.404
but for now get something
to hold you over.

49:08.478 --> 49:11.572
There's an important phrase
we use here.

49:11.648 --> 49:13.775
I think it's time
you all learned it.

49:15.085 --> 49:17.110
"Act as if."

49:17.187 --> 49:19.314
Do you understand what that means?

49:19.389 --> 49:22.187
Act as if you are
the president of this firm.

49:22.259 --> 49:25.695
Act as if you got a nine-inch cock.
Act as if.

49:25.762 --> 49:28.697
And to do that properly,
you need to at least look the part.

49:28.765 --> 49:32.531
So go get dressed. Secondly, it's time
to get your Series Seven books.

49:32.602 --> 49:35.298
Don't get nervous.
If you study, you'll pass.

49:35.372 --> 49:39.741
Then you begin trading
as an S.E.C. -licensed broker.

49:39.810 --> 49:43.974
Then you're a fucking millionaire,
and it's just that simple.

49:44.047 --> 49:47.642
I need 300 bucks from each
of you for the books...

49:47.718 --> 49:50.380
which will be returned
if and when you pass the exam.

49:50.454 --> 49:53.946
And I need that tomorrow.
That is all.

50:00.464 --> 50:03.558
What are you?
Last night's erection?

50:03.633 --> 50:06.067
Yeah, well, you know...

50:09.639 --> 50:12.540
What's goin' on?
We're movin' to the big house, kids.

50:12.609 --> 50:17.103
Isaac here just closed a guy
for 30,000 shares of Farrow Tech.

50:17.180 --> 50:19.114
We're on the big board.
We're in there now?

50:19.182 --> 50:22.709
- Who's out?
- Todd and company. Come on. Let's go.

50:22.786 --> 50:27.746
If you couldn't pull $3,000 together,
your name wouldn't be on my desk.

50:27.824 --> 50:31.817
You're embarrassing me. I'm pitching you
from under my desk. I'm embarrassed now.

50:31.895 --> 50:34.921
Bob. Bob, be rude.
Hang up the phone.

50:34.998 --> 50:37.592
You won't.
You wanna know why?

50:37.667 --> 50:41.660
Because you see value. I am
your kids' college fund, for chrissakes.

50:41.738 --> 50:45.037
I'm gonna pass. The only people making
money passing are N.F.L. Quarterbacks.

50:45.108 --> 50:48.839
- And I don't see a number on your back.
- <i>Take me off your list.</i>

50:48.912 --> 50:52.746
Fine, fine. I'm gonna take you off
my list of successful people.

51:03.460 --> 51:04.859
Hello?

51:04.928 --> 51:07.089
<i>Hi, Mr. "Dahvis," this is Ron</i>
<i>from the</i> Daily News.

51:07.164 --> 51:10.429
- <i>How you doin'?</i>
- It's Davis, and I'm not interested.

51:10.500 --> 51:14.095
<i>- Sorry to bother you. Have a nice day.</i>
- Wait a minute.

51:14.171 --> 51:18.005
Wait. That's your pitch?
You consider that a sales call?

51:18.075 --> 51:20.566
You know, I get a call
from you guys every Saturday...

51:20.644 --> 51:22.612
and it's always
the same half-assed attempt.

51:22.679 --> 51:24.943
If you guys wanna close me,
you should sell me.

51:25.015 --> 51:28.951
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right. Start again.

51:29.019 --> 51:32.386
<i>Okay. Hi, this is Ron</i>
<i>from the</i> Daily News.

51:32.456 --> 51:36.415
- <i>How you doin' this morning?</i>
- Shitty. What do you want?

51:36.493 --> 51:39.121
<i>It's not what I want, sir.</i>
<i>It's what you want.</i>

51:39.196 --> 51:42.256
Ron, now we're talkin'.
All right. What are you selling me?

51:42.332 --> 51:46.132
<i>I'm offering a Daily News subscription</i>
<i>at a substantially reduced price.</i>

51:46.203 --> 51:49.434
<i>We're trying to reach out to people</i>
<i>that never had home delivery before.</i>

51:49.506 --> 51:53.840
So everybody who already has a
subscription is getting fucked?

51:53.910 --> 51:57.539
- <i>Yeah. I guess so.</i>
- All right. I can handle that.

51:57.614 --> 52:00.742
So, why should I buy <i>your</i> paper?
I mean, you know...

52:00.817 --> 52:04.378
Why shouldn't I get the <i>Times</i>
or the <i>Voice,</i> you know?

52:04.454 --> 52:07.685
<i>The</i> Village Voice <i>is free, sir,</i> so if
<i>you want it, you should pick it up.</i>

52:07.757 --> 52:11.523
<i>But the</i> Daily News <i>offers you something</i>
<i>no other paper can... a taste of New York.</i>

52:11.595 --> 52:14.655
<i>We have the best features, more photos</i>
<i>than any other daily in New York...</i>

52:14.731 --> 52:17.063
<i>and we have the most</i>
<i>reliable delivery in the city.</i>

52:17.134 --> 52:18.294
<i>Now what do you think?</i>

52:18.368 --> 52:21.496
You know what I think, Ron?
I think that was a sales call.

52:21.571 --> 52:24.199
Good job, buddy.

52:24.274 --> 52:26.970
<i>So you gonna</i>
<i>buy a subscription?</i>

52:27.043 --> 52:30.672
No. I already
get the <i>Times.</i>

52:30.747 --> 52:32.874
<i>I know what you're sayin'!</i>

52:35.185 --> 52:38.279
Booked. Booked.
I got a hundred against.

52:38.355 --> 52:41.017
Booked. Someone cover Greg.
Cover Greg.

52:44.427 --> 52:47.692
I hope you guys aren't fightin' over it.
Here. Good money against Greg's roll.

52:47.764 --> 52:51.461
- Put it there.
- Two hundred?

52:56.506 --> 52:59.964
- What is that?
- Nothing.

53:00.043 --> 53:03.012
Damn. Who you gotta ass-fuck
to get a ten around here?

53:03.079 --> 53:05.172
- There's a leprechaun in stall four.
- Whatever.

53:05.248 --> 53:08.149
Hey, Seth, I'm gonna get some reserves.
You wanna come with me?

53:08.218 --> 53:09.651
- Yeah.
- You guys want a shot?

53:09.719 --> 53:12.711
Roll a seven, baby. Let's go.

53:12.789 --> 53:17.089
Quit starin'
and just apologize.

53:17.160 --> 53:20.994
Hey, he doesn't have to say shit,
all right?

53:21.064 --> 53:24.261
Why don't you go back to your Heineken
and shut the fuck up, okay?

53:24.334 --> 53:27.667
Was I talkin' to you?

53:27.737 --> 53:30.205
No, you weren't.
You were talkin' to him.

53:30.273 --> 53:33.401
If you're talkin' to him, you're talkin'
to me and my whole fuckin' crew, okay?

53:33.476 --> 53:38.345
Get the fuck outta here.
What? What?

53:38.415 --> 53:41.407
Get the fuck outta here before
I put you in a mayonnaise jar, okay?

53:41.484 --> 53:44.578
Get the fuck outta here,
fuckin' cocksucker.

53:50.961 --> 53:54.954
He's gonna cry
like a little baby!

53:55.031 --> 53:58.262
You little baby!

53:58.335 --> 54:00.929
Hey, Richie!
Hey, Richie!

54:01.004 --> 54:04.132
Oh, Mommy!

54:07.544 --> 54:09.774
Come on.

54:14.217 --> 54:17.448
You gotta realize these aren't the kids
you and I grew up with, you know?

54:17.520 --> 54:22.753
Remember in Hebrew school,
when a shoving match was a big deal?

54:22.826 --> 54:25.659
Worst-case scenario, somebody
got their yarmulke knocked off.

54:27.731 --> 54:31.929
It's true, man.
These guys are no joke.

54:32.002 --> 54:35.267
They get all tanked up,
throw a quick fist.

54:35.338 --> 54:37.329
Some of them actually enjoy it.

54:37.407 --> 54:40.171
I mean, like, Richie.
What the fuck is that, man?

54:40.243 --> 54:42.507
Probably thought I was being
tough back there with that guy.

54:43.813 --> 54:45.576
I was shitting my pants.

54:45.649 --> 54:48.174
- I saw that.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

54:48.251 --> 54:51.948
These fuckin' Guineas, man.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.547
Half of them do coke.
They all drink. Zero capital.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.388
No fuckin' stability. They
make all this fucking money...

54:57.460 --> 55:00.918
and they're always
living three steps ahead.

55:00.997 --> 55:04.262
You know, there's guys who work at the
firm that make a million a year...

55:04.334 --> 55:07.497
and they can't even get a fucking
car loan 'cause their credit's so bad.

55:07.570 --> 55:09.970
It's like everybody is just waiting
for the 15th of the month.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.100
They may have a Porsche, but they don't
have ten bucks to put in the gas tank.

55:13.176 --> 55:16.111
- No shit.
- It's nigger rich.

55:18.381 --> 55:21.179
What is this guy doin'?
Yo!

55:31.328 --> 55:34.786
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Don't forget what I said about Abby.

55:34.864 --> 55:37.833
I think she's trouble,
you know?

55:37.901 --> 55:40.062
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

55:40.136 --> 55:42.127
I don't know.
I've just worked there a long time.

55:42.205 --> 55:44.639
Just looking out for my friends.

55:44.708 --> 55:48.144
I think she's a whore.
Just telling you.

55:48.211 --> 55:51.544
Well, it's a good thing
you stopped dating her, then, right?

55:51.614 --> 55:54.208
- I'll see you later.
- All right. See you.
