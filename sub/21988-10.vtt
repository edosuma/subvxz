WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.373
MAN:
Tonight's show is coming to us

00:05.406 --> 00:07.408
from halfway around the world.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.344
So, let's hear a big round
of applause for Chet Goodman.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.246
(cheering, applause)

00:13.547 --> 00:15.783
The Afghan desert.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.519
I've been in a situation
like this before.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.655
Hot air blowing
in my face all day,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.657
icy cold at night,

00:23.691 --> 00:26.694
never knowing when the
enemy's gonna attack.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.230
Finally, I had to divorce her.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.399
(laughter)

00:31.432 --> 00:33.367
I mean, sure, I
lost my apartment.
That's not funny.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.835
I lost the car.
It's a joke, Senator.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.704
I lost my last
shred of dignity,
Explain how a divorce

00:36.737 --> 00:38.706
but I didn't triple
the national deficit
is like a military drawdown

00:38.739 --> 00:40.474
in a hostile country
with an unfamiliar culture.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.710
No $2,000 government
contract toilet seats
Um...

00:42.743 --> 00:44.178
in my house.
I think you just did.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.546
CHET:
And don't get me wrong.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.548
I still drunk dial my ex.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.550
But you all moved back in.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.552
Damn right. Oorah!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.421
SOLDIERS:
Oorah!

00:53.454 --> 00:54.388
Who's that?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.224
Senator Phillips?

00:56.257 --> 00:57.558
I'm getting heckled

00:57.591 --> 00:59.127
by a Washington politician?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.095
And three-star Marine general.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.496
SOLDIERS:
Oorah!

01:02.530 --> 01:04.132
Generals.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.500
Always sending someone else
to fight your battles.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.536
When I'm fighting, you'll know.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.105
SOLDIERS: Ooh.
All due respect, this
is a goodwill tour.

01:11.139 --> 01:14.375
You take your security detail
and go back to shaking hands.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.510
Let me handle the jokes.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.780
I would,
except the Geneva Conventions

01:19.813 --> 01:21.582
make torture illegal.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.351
(laughter)

01:23.384 --> 01:24.385
I can clearly see...
(phone ringing)

01:24.418 --> 01:26.654
there's some
home-field advantage.
Excuse me.

01:26.687 --> 01:27.821
I-I know when I'm
losing a crowd.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.290
Gibbs?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.159
Can you hear me?
Yeah, barely.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.461
The show's getting a bit rowdy,

01:33.494 --> 01:35.696
thanks to your buddy
Phillips here.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.698
It's taken a few days,
but I totally get

01:37.731 --> 01:40.301
why your unit loved him
in Desert Storm.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.603
Hey, Sloane,
I didn't call to chat.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.505
(laughter)
What's wrong?

01:44.538 --> 01:45.706
CHET: This place would even
depress Charlie Brown.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.141
(laughter)

01:47.175 --> 01:48.876
Senator Phillips' son, Chandler.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.644
He's in ICU.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.513
The ICU?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.315
What happened?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.683
GIBBS:
I'm still trying to find out.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.818
Doctors say it's bad.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.720
He might not live.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.422
(cheering, applause)

02:01.455 --> 02:03.591
Oh, my God.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
*

02:36.324 --> 02:38.759
That's a...

02:38.792 --> 02:40.961
hell of a gut punch, Gibbs.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.663
Yes, sir.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.198
What happened?

02:44.232 --> 02:47.301
Well, according to
the Metro Police report,

02:47.335 --> 02:48.902
Chandler fell from
a stairwell landing

02:48.936 --> 02:50.438
in his apartment building.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.739
It was a 20-foot drop,

02:51.772 --> 02:54.275
and, in addition
to breaking his foot,

02:54.308 --> 02:55.676
he also hit his head

02:55.709 --> 02:56.677
on the concrete steps.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.612
Is that the whole story?

02:59.647 --> 03:02.550
They think he was drinking.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.888
I'm getting home to see my boy.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.590
Understood?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.725
Understood, sir.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.894
Already trying to arrange
an earlier flight, sir.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.563
Don't sugarcoat it, Gunny.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.266
Doctors put a clock
on this thing?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.000
Clock's ticking, General.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.537
I will be there.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.606
Gibbs.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.575
I just spoke to the
head of neurology.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.778
Barring a Christmas miracle,

03:30.811 --> 03:32.646
Phillips won't make it

03:32.680 --> 03:35.283
back here in time.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.718
Look, I know you and the
senator go back a long way

03:37.751 --> 03:41.555
and that you wanted to be a part
of his security detail.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.757
What's done is done.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.299
BISHOP:
Hi, Detective.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.605
So, what did the doctor have to
say this time, Detective Mayer?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.440
Same as before, Agent Bishop.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.376
Chandler Phillips' injuries are
consistent with a drunken fall.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.811
Got it. Got it.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.514
E-Except his blood alcohol
came back,

04:06.547 --> 04:08.015
and it was
under the legal limit.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.851
So drinking, yes. Drunk, no.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.720
Did the neighbors
see anything?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.522
Did you process the scene?

04:14.555 --> 04:15.856
Do you mind if I just,
like, take a look?

04:15.889 --> 04:16.990
No. Yes.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.592
And this isn't your case.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.860
You can read my report
after it's been filed

04:19.893 --> 04:21.862
and I've started
my well-deserved holiday break,

04:21.895 --> 04:24.832
which I can't do
until you go away.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.535
Cool. Cool.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.969
Yeah, my, uh...

04:29.002 --> 04:31.004
brothers and parents are
coming in from Oklahoma.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.406
Hey, that's an evidence file.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.574
You're not authorized
to handle it.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.008
Don't worry. I'll sign the log.
Wait.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.710
No.

04:36.744 --> 04:37.878
Oops.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.780
I guess that means you
now have to add NCIS

04:39.813 --> 04:42.082
to the chain of evidence. I...

04:42.115 --> 04:45.386
Or I can just sign the whole
damn case over to NCIS.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.088
You want more work?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.490
Merry Christmas.

04:51.659 --> 04:55.463
And a happy New Year.

05:02.703 --> 05:06.374
It's starting to make sense.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.641
What's up? (clears throat)

05:07.675 --> 05:09.710
Torres and Gibbs

05:09.743 --> 05:12.079
were supposed to be
my security detail.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.382
But I guess
you've been here before?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.650
Yes, sir. Almost ten years ago.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.352
Army psyop.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.388
Why did you want to come back?

05:20.421 --> 05:23.357
I spoke to base command.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.659
The earliest flight
out is in 42 hours.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.695
That's too late.
Helmand province

05:27.728 --> 05:29.096
is heavy with Taliban,

05:29.129 --> 05:32.032
and this airfield
is no longer secure, sir.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.834
Which is exactly the reason

05:33.867 --> 05:36.136
the U.S. Marines
were sent back here.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.705
Well, until they get
the Afghan National Army

05:37.738 --> 05:40.007
and this base up to snuff,
we need an air escort,

05:40.040 --> 05:43.143
and there's not one available
until the day after next.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.546
Okay.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.015
We'll switch airfields.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.421
(insects trill, bird twitters)

05:53.454 --> 05:55.889
(rustling, zipper closes)

05:57.057 --> 05:59.527
This is a Marine-occupied base.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.595
You sleep with a weapon
under your pillow?

06:01.629 --> 06:03.030
It's the desert.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.566
You know, scorpions.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.068
Senator, it's the
middle of the night.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.571
Where are you going?
Home.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.905
To see my son.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.807
There's a plane
leaving in the morning

06:13.841 --> 06:15.809
from Lashkargah airport.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.044
A few hours away.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.512
You up for that?

06:21.549 --> 06:24.151
Die Hard is my favorite
Christmas movie.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.420
I don't know what that means.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.155
I'm here on a holiday adventure.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.090
Gentlemen, buckle up.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.792
I got us a ride.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.761
I had to make
a small compromise,

06:33.794 --> 06:37.731
but there was already a Humvee
going to that airport.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.000
One Humvee
for all that desert?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.436
It's not ideal,
but it's out best shot

06:42.470 --> 06:44.137
of getting you home.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.806
Too risky.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.475
I can go alone.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.479
We go where you go.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.146
Why was there a transport

06:53.180 --> 06:55.148
already on the way
to the airport?

06:55.182 --> 06:57.485
Well, um...

06:57.518 --> 06:59.987
about that compromise...
CHET:
Knock, knock.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.689
Hey, Senator.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.024
Looks like we're
pulling out together.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.058
Oorah!

07:17.771 --> 07:20.774
I see you, McGee.

07:20.808 --> 07:21.909
Everything okay?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.977
No. No, it's not.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.113
Because you decided
to take over a Metro case

07:26.146 --> 07:27.815
on December 22.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.050
That is-- let's see-- one, two,

07:30.083 --> 07:31.785
three days before Christmas.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.253
I have plans, too.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.055
With twin newborn cherubs?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.256
I'm sorry. I-I thought

07:36.289 --> 07:38.892
this was an important thing
to see through.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.961
Look, our job was to update
the senator on the case,

07:40.994 --> 07:43.063
not take it over.
His son fell down the stairs.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.832
I-I felt like

07:44.865 --> 07:47.134
Metro was rushing
to call this an accident,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.236
and they've overlooked
several factors

07:49.269 --> 07:50.804
that would suggest foul play.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.506
Such as?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.141
Such as...

07:55.576 --> 07:57.645
Chandler Phillips

07:57.678 --> 07:59.046
has a criminal record.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.014
27. Single. Unemployed.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.083
Well, he didn't live up
to his war hero dad.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.284
Doesn't prove anything.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.587
Well, the accident
could be connected

08:06.620 --> 08:08.155
to his criminal activity.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.890
Chandler was
arrested last year

08:09.923 --> 08:12.726
for possession
of illegal prescription drugs.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.561
And it made the news

08:13.594 --> 08:15.729
because the senator
had just sponsored

08:15.763 --> 08:16.830
an anti-drug bill.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.266
Well, looks bad
if your kid's a user.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
And then to save face,
the senator

08:21.301 --> 08:23.737
paid for Chandler's bail

08:23.771 --> 08:24.938
and then publicly disowned him.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.239
His only child.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.709
And that was a week

08:28.742 --> 08:32.546
after the senator's wife
died of cancer.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.548
Stressful time.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.916
Chandler fell off the radar,

08:35.949 --> 08:38.218
and they haven't spoken since.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.588
Well, given the senator's
determination to get home,

08:40.621 --> 08:42.556
I'd say he's willing
to forgive and forget.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.757
He's a dad.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.959
All parents love their kids...

08:45.993 --> 08:47.561
no matter what.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.062
You think the same thing
works in reverse, boss?

08:49.096 --> 08:50.631
You know,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.900
if a parent misses
their kid's first Christmas?

08:52.933 --> 08:55.335
The twins are four weeks old.
They'll never remember.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.270
Um, photos.
Uh, Photoshop.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.305
Enough.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.007
Almost dawn in Afghanistan.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.341
Yeah, I just heard

09:01.374 --> 09:02.275
from Sloane and Torres.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.310
They're transporting the senator

09:03.343 --> 09:04.812
to a civilian airport.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.179
If there's more to this case,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.048
I want to know about it
before wheels up.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.720
You, too, Father Christmas.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.192
CHET:
I got shotgun.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.230
I can't wait to get out of here.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.165
This is your bag, Chet?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.768
Years on the road have taught me
drink heavy and travel light.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.072
That bag has been to dives
all over the world.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.607
Now it's been to this one.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.375
But six porta-potties
for 300 Marines

09:35.408 --> 09:36.977
is not what I signed up for.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.979
Luckily I just got word
that I'm up for a lead role

09:39.012 --> 09:41.248
in a comedy pilot.
Writer wants to meet this week.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.851
Oh, so you got
a Marine transport

09:43.884 --> 09:45.853
to be your own personal Uber.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.855
My agent also reps Colin Powell.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.891
Cut the chatter. That flight's
not gonna wait for us.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.293
What are the seating
arrangements?

09:53.326 --> 09:56.396
Knock, knock.
Uh, who's there?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.231
Chumps ride the hump.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.870
(sighs) That's not even a joke.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.042
Well, the stairs match
Metro's reports.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.343
Nothing new there.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.046
This place is not so sexy.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.783
I don't know. The roaches
downstairs didn't seem to mind.

10:15.816 --> 10:19.386
I pulled up Chandler's
social media posts,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.889
and they all show
expensive hotels,

10:21.922 --> 10:23.423
wild parties,

10:23.456 --> 10:26.293
and an overall "sexy" lifestyle.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.361
Where does he get the money?
The senator?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.430
I doubt it.
Chandler's bank account

10:30.463 --> 10:32.866
has been dormant
for over a year.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.434
He must be using cash.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.203
Did Metro follow up on that?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.906
No, but they did talk
to the roommate.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.941
(rap music playing loudly)
Seth Hendrix.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.416
Federal agents.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.052
(knocks on door)

10:52.085 --> 10:55.422
Seth Hendrix?

10:55.455 --> 10:59.459
A... Ocean's Eleven-themed
porno movie?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.194
Or an illegal casino.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.063
(music shuts off)

11:03.096 --> 11:05.032
It's all legit, okay?

11:05.065 --> 11:08.368
Sorry, I-I didn't hear
you guys knock.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.003
I'm still in mourning.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.439
NCIS Special Agents
Bishop and McGee.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.242
And you do know
that Chandler's not dead?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.478
Did his dad,
Senator Smug, send you?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.047
I already talked
to the cops.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.917
Yeah. Uh, we'd like
to confirm what happened.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.386
(sighs)
Chandler and I

11:26.419 --> 11:29.189
were playing video games
and drinking,

11:29.222 --> 11:31.759
when he decided
to run out for coffee.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.761
Our vision was getting
a little blurry,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.428
and we were having a hard time
discerning

11:35.462 --> 11:38.131
between the Darkin
and the Iceborn.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.868
Video game creatures.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.002
Next thing I know,
Metro Police

11:42.035 --> 11:44.437
are at the door saying
Chandler fell.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.473
I was inside the whole time.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.076
And the... backroom Bellagio?

11:49.109 --> 11:50.944
The table's just for practice.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.914
We were professional gamblers.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.249
And best friends.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.920
Again, Chandler's... not dead.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.289
We're gonna look around
a little bit.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.359
SLOANE: Things are going
smoothly here, Gibbs.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.028
Any updates on Chandler?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.429
What do you know, Gunny?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.164
Swelling hasn't gone down.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.767
But Chandler, he's hanging on.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.202
Good to hear.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.437
We'll check in once
we get to the airport.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.472
Be safe.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.815
Corporal, this isn't
the route we discussed.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.117
How can you tell?
Everything looks the same.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.485
The senator and I talked
before we left, ma'am.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.487
This way's faster.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.023
Every second counts.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.825
And Corporal Girard knows
every curve,

12:37.858 --> 12:40.527
canyon, and crack
of this desert.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.564
JIMMY: I knew this
would come back to bite me.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.399
The first year I invite
Breena's parents over

12:46.433 --> 12:48.401
for Themed Christmas
and we get a last-minute case.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.171
Isn't Christmas the
theme of Christmas?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.907
God, Breena's dad is gonna
roast me like the prize goose

12:53.941 --> 12:55.542
the butcher just delivered.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.545
I was gonna wear a waistcoat,
Abbs, make figgy pudding.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.480
Did you even look

13:00.513 --> 13:03.450
at the 3-D model that
I sent you, Charles Dickens?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.918
Hey, that's the theme
we were going for.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.586
Yes, I did. But...

13:06.619 --> 13:08.822
based on the medical records
from the hospital,

13:08.856 --> 13:10.824
your animation
is incorrect.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.126
See, it shows
that Chandler fell forward

13:13.160 --> 13:15.996
with his face hitting first.
It was based
on momentum

13:16.029 --> 13:18.999
and him walking forward,
you know, like a human.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.468
Yeah, but the severity
of his cranial wound means

13:21.501 --> 13:23.436
that the back of his head
hit first.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.172
(sighs) I thought
you were gonna say that.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.107
So I made a second model.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.110
In order for Chandler to hit
the back of his head first,

13:30.143 --> 13:32.345
he would have
to have fallen

13:32.379 --> 13:35.348
backwards
and at a very high velocity.

13:35.382 --> 13:39.152
Right. So why did you show me
the first model?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.988
Because, Bob Cratchit,
you're not the only one

13:41.021 --> 13:43.123
with Christmas plans.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.158
I was hoping
you would say I was wrong.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.594
Well, you're not.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.629
Chandler Phillips
fell straight backwards.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.000
Which, even if he was buzzed, is
really hard to do at that speed.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.002
Unless he was pushed.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.437
Humbug.
Humbug.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.574
CHET:
I'm just saying, I get it.

14:01.608 --> 14:05.178
My old man disowned me
for wanting to be a comic.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.881
I was nine.
I didn't say "disown."

14:07.915 --> 14:10.884
I turned my back
on Chandler because he...

14:10.918 --> 14:12.352
lacked purpose

14:12.385 --> 14:15.088
and only thought of himself.
Sound familiar?

14:15.122 --> 14:18.258
Yeah. You even have
my dad's righteous indignation.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.060
The only difference
between you and Chandler is

14:20.093 --> 14:22.529
that he still has a chance
to be a decent human being.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.031
Hey, hey, hey, you two.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.900
I will turn this car around.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.635
We may have to. Corporal.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.602
Everybody hold on.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.552
IED.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.088
It's old. But it means
the Taliban's back

14:48.121 --> 14:49.656
to playing their
greatest hits.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.425
Uh, is it safe to be out here?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.627
Senator, if this crater's an
indication of what's ahead,

14:54.661 --> 14:57.197
we have to turn back.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.699
I got to call this in.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.535
What about taking
the longer route?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.571
It's too late.

15:04.604 --> 15:08.008
What? That's it?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.978
Well, that's just great.
Merry flippin' Christmas.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.996
Radio's gone, too.

15:29.029 --> 15:29.862
Sat phone?

15:29.896 --> 15:32.232
Left it in the backseat
when we got out.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.034
So nobody knows we're here.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.335
What the hell
just happened?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.270
Was that crater
some kind of trap?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.672
Crater had nothing to do
with it.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.709
There was a live IED
buried in the road.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.677
Well, why didn't it go off
immediately?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.713
We-we should be dead.
Are we dead?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.581
The explosive had a delay

15:48.615 --> 15:52.252
so it doesn't just hit the lead
vehicle in a convoy, okay?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.753
This is not
what I signed up for.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.123
It's too dangerous to
stay out in the open.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.492
Whoever planted the bomb has
likely heard their handiwork.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.761
We have to find shelter.
Yeah, I think we passed

16:01.794 --> 16:02.996
a Starbucks.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.534
There.

16:07.567 --> 16:11.671
The mountains? Isn't that
where the Taliban live?

16:11.704 --> 16:13.506
Move.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.379
Senator.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.382
Sir, we got to go.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.354
*

16:27.387 --> 16:30.023
It's late, Abby.
What do you got?

16:30.057 --> 16:34.027
Well, hopefully more answers
for Senator Phillips.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.196
I haven't found
anything to suggest

16:36.229 --> 16:38.198
who tried to
murder Chandler.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.034
But you were right--
something is hinky.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.702
He was running
an illegal casino.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.337
Casino, no.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.739
Illegal, yes.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.209
How much you want to bet
I can roll a two?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.278
Well, odds are 36 to one.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.215
Nice.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.218
These are casino-grade dice

16:58.251 --> 17:00.320
made from a cellulose acetate.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.422
The dots are called pips.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.324
They're drilled,
and then they're filled

17:04.357 --> 17:08.561
with a white plastic with
the same density as the dice.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.830
So that they weigh the same
on each side.
And so that

17:10.863 --> 17:12.432
they roll evenly.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.500
But these didn't.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.802
Because these dice are loaded.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.669
The pips on one side

17:16.703 --> 17:19.106
have been filled
with something that's

17:19.139 --> 17:21.241
ten times heavier
than the plastic.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.643
I don't see anything wrong.
Exactly.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.478
Loaded dice
are usually terrible.

17:25.512 --> 17:29.116
Like, a casino
can identify them immediately.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.783
But these are perfect.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.786
Whoever made these
is really smart

17:33.820 --> 17:36.289
and really skilled.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.759
Probably with, like,
a chemical engineering degree.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.529
Chandler Phillips
dropped out of college,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.664
but Seth Hendrix did not.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.434
The drunken roommate?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.369
McGEE: Yeah, apparently,
this guy graduated

17:49.402 --> 17:52.172
from MIT with a GPA
two-tenths higher than mine.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.573
(exhales)

18:10.657 --> 18:12.859
Clear.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.162
Clear. Come on in, folks.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.898
I suppose
you're gonna complain.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.467
You kidding?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.769
This is better than most
of the motels I stay in.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.637
Cleaner, anyways.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.139
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
As soon as we don't check in,

18:27.807 --> 18:30.243
camp command will
send out an alert.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.445
We'll be able to hear
a search team from in here.
Yeah, I'm thinking,

18:32.479 --> 18:34.747
what, a few hours.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.184
Might be longer.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.887
Why's that, Senator?

18:42.289 --> 18:45.892
The route change
through the hills--

18:45.925 --> 18:48.728
I planned and cleared it
with our driver.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.563
But, uh...

18:50.597 --> 18:52.399
I knew once camp command
found out,

18:52.432 --> 18:54.867
they'd change our quick hop
into a time-wasting convoy.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.307
So...?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.209
They think we took the long way.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.711
Well, they'll send
a search team.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.547
But they'll be looking
in the wrong place.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.924
(rap remix playing loudly)
Nothing like a little

19:17.957 --> 19:19.492
holiday spirit
at the crack of dawn.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.394
(pounding on door)
MAN: Hey! You in there?

19:21.428 --> 19:22.962
The neighbors seem
to think so.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.731
(loud pounding)

19:24.764 --> 19:25.732
Hey!

19:25.765 --> 19:27.767
(scoffs)

19:29.269 --> 19:30.870
Poor guy.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.872
Well, let's help him out.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.241
* We go ho, ho, ho...

19:34.274 --> 19:36.709
(remix of "Jingle Bells"
continues playing)

19:44.617 --> 19:47.354
* We go ho, ho, ho

19:47.387 --> 19:49.289
*

19:55.762 --> 19:57.630
(music shuts off)

19:57.664 --> 19:58.931
Must be ten grand
cash there.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.234
And a nice bottle
of champagne.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
All right, you ready?

20:02.269 --> 20:02.902
Federal agents!
NCIS!

20:02.935 --> 20:03.903
Get up!
(screams)

20:03.936 --> 20:05.338
All right. Okay.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.243
Gibbs, I just got your message.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.912
Everything okay?
He's awake.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.781
Thank God.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.916
Well, you should call
the senator.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.253
I think we just got
that Christmas miracle.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.255
(chuckles)

20:22.289 --> 20:23.623
(phone beeping)

20:23.656 --> 20:26.259
When's the last time
you heard from Agent Sloane?

20:26.293 --> 20:27.327
Excuse me, sir.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.295
I don't mean
to interrupt.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.263
Gunny, NCIS Director Vance.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.465
How can I help you?
I just read in the paper
this morning

20:32.499 --> 20:34.501
that Chandler Phillips
had been hospitalized.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.570
Yeah. Last night. But he seems
to be putting up a fight.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.906
Glad to hear it. Just wanted
to come and offer my support.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.774
You know his father?

20:41.808 --> 20:44.611
No, sir. Chandler came into
my recruitment office yesterday.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.847
Chandler Phillips?
I didn't know who he was

20:47.880 --> 20:49.916
at first,
until he told me his story.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.385
Chandler wanted to turn over
a new leaf.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.287
His criminal record
would require a waiver,

20:54.321 --> 20:56.956
but he said that life
was all behind him.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.794
Chandler Phillips just enlisted
in the Marines.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.997
SLOANE:
One first aid kit.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.835
Six pieces
of foil-wrapped chewing gum.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.403
Four protein bars.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.771
And two flashlights.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.806
Which might come
in handy soon.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.443
And so will this map.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.977
It belonged
to the corporal.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.612
Hey,

21:19.646 --> 21:22.014
I appreciate you making
the grocery list, but...

21:22.048 --> 21:24.617
how much longer you
plan on being in here?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.419
We've been here for hours.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.588
How 'bout actually doing
something to help us

21:28.621 --> 21:30.022
get the hell out?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.425
There is nothing to do
but wait.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.760
And listen.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.463
So shut up and man up.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.532
Oh. Like you?

21:39.566 --> 21:42.369
So noble.
So righteous.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.036
No wonder your son
couldn't live up

21:44.070 --> 21:46.439
to your expectations.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.441
They were too high.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.442
Chet.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.512
I said I got it.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.448
Son didn't go into
the family business,

21:55.482 --> 21:57.517
so Dad thinks
he's worthless,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.719
and is forced to turn his back.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.690
You don't take responsibility
for any of it, do you?

22:03.723 --> 22:08.361
Whatever issues you may have,
I am not your father.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.363
No.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.899
My dad never got
an innocent Marine killed.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.868
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.971
Enough. Come on.
Break it up.
Enough, children.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.573
Feel better now?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.575
Get down!

22:24.411 --> 22:26.379
(grunts)

22:33.720 --> 22:35.388
(distant chatter)

22:35.422 --> 22:38.591
(quietly):
Come on. Come on.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.596
Go.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.606
(groans)
Senator?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.142
Everybody okay back there?

22:56.175 --> 22:58.110
No! He's been shot!

22:58.144 --> 22:58.845
(Phillips groans)

23:07.820 --> 23:08.821
MARINE HELO PILOT (over radio):
Negative visual.

23:08.855 --> 23:09.789
We have a few more minutes
in this search grid,

23:09.822 --> 23:12.058
and then we'll have to head back
for refuel.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.931
Anything from our
casino grifters?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.900
They're on
their way in.
Good.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.836
Doctors removed Chandler's
breathing tube.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.506
While there doesn't seem to be
any long-term brain damage,

23:26.539 --> 23:28.207
he can't remember
what happened.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.777
That why you
called me up here?
No.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.945
I've been on the horn
with central command.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.981
Transport never made it
to the airport.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.148
Search team.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.684
Ground and air.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.151
So far, no sign.

23:42.121 --> 23:45.592
You want something from me,
Leon, just ask.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.794
I wanted you
to be on that detail.

23:47.827 --> 23:51.464
When Phillips requested
an NCIS security escort,

23:51.498 --> 23:53.566
Agent Sloane
begged me to go.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.902
I said "no."
Yeah.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.237
Then why the hell did you
give up your spot

23:58.270 --> 24:00.039
and tell her that
it was on my orders?

24:00.072 --> 24:02.975
It seemed important to her.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.645
Question is
why did you say "no"?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.580
Because of your relationship
with the senator.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.081
I was doing you a favor.
Since when?

24:09.115 --> 24:11.951
You trying to protect Sloane?

24:11.984 --> 24:14.621
I'm trying to prevent history
from repeating itself.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.990
She can handle it.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.931
SLOANE:
The bullet just missed
your armor.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.633
There wasn't much
to work with, but, uh,

24:26.666 --> 24:28.768
I think it will hold.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.538
My guts are still on the inside?

24:31.571 --> 24:33.673
Yeah, they are.
(grunts)

24:33.706 --> 24:37.176
So is the bullet... deep.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.111
So no more fistfights, kid.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.847
(chuckles)

24:40.880 --> 24:42.081
He did save my life.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.850
I suppose I owe him something.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.252
How about silence?

24:48.888 --> 24:50.757
(sighs)

24:50.790 --> 24:53.860
Why do you have your agents
taking apart my craps table?

24:53.893 --> 24:56.596
It's custom-made.
Evidence.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.831
Cheating the casinos
means serious prison time.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.036
They don't always
roll a two.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.938
Oh, so you admit
to loading the dice?

25:05.972 --> 25:07.574
Well, that was fast.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.709
How about attacking Chandler?
Did you do that, too?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.277
Because that wasn't an accident.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.613
I'm willing to come clean
on the dice,

25:13.646 --> 25:15.648
if that proves I didn't commit
attempted murder.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.216
It doesn't.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.986
I never admitted
to using the dice.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.721
Expensive hotel rooms,

25:21.754 --> 25:23.122
the wad of cash we found
in your apartment--

25:23.155 --> 25:24.824
that's all, what?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.258
Pure luck?

25:26.292 --> 25:27.960
That's about to run out.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.062
McGEE:
You and Chandler

25:30.096 --> 25:31.931
were partners in your
little casino con,

25:31.964 --> 25:34.634
till two days ago
when he wanted out.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.135
He joined the Marines.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.806
(scoffs)

25:39.839 --> 25:41.941
The Marines?

25:41.974 --> 25:44.110
(laughing): Okay, come on.
Th-that's a joke.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.712
(laughs)

25:52.051 --> 25:54.086
Look, Chandler never
wanted to be like his dad.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.287
So if he was going straight,
this is the first

25:55.321 --> 25:56.856
we've heard about it.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.859
Who's we?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.195
BISHOP:
So there's actually three

26:03.229 --> 26:06.332
of you involved
in the casino con.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.300
Misty Boxlarter.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.069
You also went to MIT.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.672
But, unlike Seth,
you dropped out.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.040
It's a tough school.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.875
Not for him.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.777
Seth's a genius.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.679
Clearly.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.914
Uh, you and Seth are together?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.249
We met at school.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.751
And Chandler?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.252
Did you try to kill him?

26:26.285 --> 26:29.756
I wasn't even there that night.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.991
The guys would rather spend
their money on a party

26:32.024 --> 26:35.628
than a nice apartment,
so I have my own place.

26:35.662 --> 26:38.064
Can anybody verify
you were there?

26:38.097 --> 26:39.966
No.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.002
But I would never hurt Chandler,
and neither would Seth.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.771
Why?

26:44.804 --> 26:47.206
(sighs)
I'll have to show you.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.010
Do you play craps?

26:51.043 --> 26:53.880
I bet you're sorry
you came here now.

26:53.913 --> 26:57.684
We both had our reasons
for coming, sir.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.687
You find what
you were looking for?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.855
Have you?

27:02.889 --> 27:05.725
(laughs)
Of course.

27:05.758 --> 27:09.996
I travel to battle zones
every Christmas...

27:11.030 --> 27:13.666
...to show support.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.369
For the troops.
(grunts)

27:17.403 --> 27:20.707
Now you're analyzing me.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.341
What do you say?

27:22.374 --> 27:26.345
I'm, uh, running away from
spending the holidays at home?

27:26.378 --> 27:28.347
With family?

27:28.380 --> 27:32.451
I'm just talking
in a cave.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.853
(grunts)

27:33.886 --> 27:36.022
What do you want
me to say, huh?

27:36.055 --> 27:38.157
That Chet's right?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.192
SLOANE:
(clears throat)
I don't know.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.228
Was he?

27:42.261 --> 27:44.096
(sighs)

27:44.130 --> 27:46.132
(laughs)

27:47.834 --> 27:49.836
(exhales)
Yes.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.772
Okay?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.775
When your wife passed away,
it was just you and Chandler.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.210
That must have been
really hard.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.447
I'd been hurt in battle before.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.284
(sighs)

28:05.317 --> 28:09.188
Her death was
a new kind of pain.

28:09.221 --> 28:13.359
I coped... how
I knew best.

28:15.862 --> 28:20.099
Faced with loss,
we all do, sir.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.869
PHILLIPS:
I played a stoic Marine.

28:22.902 --> 28:26.205
Emotions in check.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.840
But Chandler took it

28:27.874 --> 28:31.010
as a sign of not caring.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.480
Like he did when I
pushed him to be better.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.087
I pushed so hard,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.756
I pushed him away.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.763
I never saw...

28:50.797 --> 28:52.765
the part I played in that...

28:52.799 --> 28:54.801
(laughs)

28:57.303 --> 28:59.271
(laughing):
...until...

29:01.107 --> 29:02.942
...until it punched me
in the face.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.414
I gotta tell my boy
I was wrong.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.316
(engine approaching)

29:12.184 --> 29:14.153
TORRES:
Coming in!

29:19.325 --> 29:20.459
Hey.
Hey.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.828
Here's the good news.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.263
Our Taliban Twins
were bikers.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.431
So they were alone.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.133
They were probably out
on a scout.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.201
Which means they'll be missed.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.403
We're gonna have company.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.806
Do you have enough gas in there
to get back to camp?

29:33.840 --> 29:36.242
Well, here's...
here's the bad news.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.944
Nope.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.479
Seven. Seven out.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.148
Next shooter coming out.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.550
Okay, so now the roll passes
to the next player.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.119
We'll pretend Agent McGee
is Chandler.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.255
And I am using the loaded dice.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.157
Right, which is when the
random girl drinking champagne

29:51.190 --> 29:52.591
at the end of the table

29:52.624 --> 29:55.194
decides to put a hundred
on the deuce.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.865
ABBY:
Two.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.167
Pays out 30 to one. Jimmy,

30:01.200 --> 30:05.304
give the lucky lady
$3,000.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.440
Three grand only goes so far.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.142
Ever heard of "letting it ride"?

30:10.176 --> 30:12.411
Misty is now gonna place
all three grand

30:12.444 --> 30:14.146
on the same bet.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.619
Two craps two.
That's snake eyes.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.622
It's also $90,000.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.025
And Misty's cue
to generously

30:26.058 --> 30:28.294
tip the dealer
and walk away.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.363
Chandler switches back the dice
before anyone asks questions,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.900
and we party
for the next few months.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.902
Wait a minute.
You've got three dealers

30:35.935 --> 30:37.636
watching the game
at all times.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.138
How do you get the dice
on and off the table?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.306
That's the trick.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.108
Sleight of hand.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.442
It's incredibly difficult.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.277
Even with the help of cameras,

30:45.311 --> 30:47.613
it took Chandler
over a year to learn.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.149
Neither of us know how to do it.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.351
So without him, the scam ends.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.320
Yeah, we'd never hurt
the golden goose.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.588
And we have no idea
who did. Right, babe?

30:59.425 --> 31:03.963
Misty, anything you give us
will help you with the DA.

31:03.996 --> 31:07.099
Well...

31:07.133 --> 31:09.268
While we play, Seth watches

31:09.301 --> 31:12.538
to make sure security isn't
getting too curious.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.440
A few days ago,
he thought one did.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.474
It was nothing.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.110
Just a false alarm.

31:18.144 --> 31:21.280
The pit boss in Atlantic City
who followed Chandler?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.415
Chandler never said
anything about it.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.617
Besides, I don't even remember
what the guy looked like.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.086
Oh, I do.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.288
Tall, thin, with
a dark mustache.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.324
Kind of, like,
hipster-looking.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.027
I think that
was the guy

31:35.061 --> 31:37.296
outside their door
this morning.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.102
SLOANE:
This way back to camp
isn't the way we came.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.337
A lone rider going
off-road can save time.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.338
And gas.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.074
SLOANE:
Here, I got it.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.541
You take this dry riverbed.
It's smooth,

31:49.575 --> 31:52.544
and it'll lead you right
back to camp... I hope.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.113
TORRES: I thought you'd
been here before.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.515
It's a big area; it
was a long time ago.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.350
TORRES: Do not put
doubts in my head.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.119
Uh, we have enough of those.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.320
I-I think he passed out.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.689
Senator, can
you hear me?
Senator!

32:03.722 --> 32:05.391
General?
Senator.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.026
Senator, sir.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.260
Ugh.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.561
The bleeding didn't stop.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.130
Here, put your hand

32:11.163 --> 32:13.199
underneath his bandage
and keep pressure on the wound.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.366
Directly?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.534
Yes, directly.
You want to save his life?

32:16.535 --> 32:18.604
There. Got it?

32:18.637 --> 32:21.440
Nick. You got to
get out of here now.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.475
Yippee ki-yay.
(engine revs)

32:41.027 --> 32:43.095
Hey, update
on Sloane and Torres?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.496
Search team
is still on the hunt.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.265
Anything on the casino
employment records?

32:46.298 --> 32:48.234
Oh, just downloaded.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.768
You really think

32:49.801 --> 32:52.238
mustache man is
a casino enforcer?

32:52.271 --> 32:53.772
McGEE: I just want
to find this guy.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.308
I promised the twins that
I would close this case.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.410
There.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.412
Okay. Axel McKenzie III.

33:00.446 --> 33:01.580
He's worked security
at the Atlantic Diamond Casino

33:01.613 --> 33:03.115
for the last two years.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.450
All right, send me
that contact info.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.286
Hey. No need.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.288
Boss?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.391
You found him.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.660
Actually, uh, I called.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.064
I'm not in town
to kill Chandler.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.431
I came to hire him.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.300
BISHOP:
Hire him?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.269
After catching him cheat?
Yeah. His
sleight-of-hand

33:23.302 --> 33:24.570
was flawless, and
I've seen a lot.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.373
So I cornered him, alone,
in the hotel bar.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.075
He denied it.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.143
No, that was the
craziest thing.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.445
He just admitted to the whole
scam right then and there,

33:33.479 --> 33:34.780
begged me
not to press charges.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.815
He promised that
he would get help.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.784
You know,
change his life around.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.387
He went to a Marine recruiting
office the next day.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.355
So much for hiring him.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.457
Casino thinks
we can use his skills

33:45.491 --> 33:47.659
to spot other cheaters.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.329
Look, I tried calling
before I ever showed up,

33:50.362 --> 33:51.730
but Chandler
never answered the phone.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.399
I saw why on the news
this morning,

33:53.432 --> 33:55.534
which is right when
I called you guys.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.569
Hell of an accident, huh?

33:57.603 --> 33:58.704
It wasn't.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.208
What about the money?
Decent guy or not,

34:02.241 --> 34:04.310
a casino is gonna miss 90 grand.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.378
Oh, yeah, Chandler gave it back.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.847
You mean his cut-- 30,000.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.349
No, he gave back
his partners' cut too.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.617
That was part of the deal.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.422
Is that... important?

34:16.455 --> 34:19.091
Yeah. Motive.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.596
(sighs)

34:24.630 --> 34:27.233
CHET: Damn it,
Senator, you got me

34:27.266 --> 34:29.368
feeling guilty about my dad.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.437
I'm gonna have to
call the bastard.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.507
Wingos.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.512
The name...

34:40.546 --> 34:44.216
on the wall.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.486
You part of that?

34:47.519 --> 34:50.256
Op was classified, sir.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.193
Not everyone made it.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.331
That must have been hard.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.372
I coped the best I knew how.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.875
Senator?

35:11.577 --> 35:13.412
What do we do?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.247
Have faith.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.693
McGEE:
Chandler told you

35:27.726 --> 35:29.561
he got caught.
And that he gave away

35:29.595 --> 35:31.530
all your secrets
and all your money.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.399
You got angry, and Chandler

35:33.432 --> 35:34.900
stormed out of the apartment,

35:34.933 --> 35:36.735
into the stairwell,
and you followed.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.470
No.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.473
You-you can't prove anything.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.576
How could he give away
your secret dice recipe?

35:44.610 --> 35:47.313
I mean, that's your life's work.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.880
It's pretty convincing
to a jury.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.350
It just depends
on how we charge you.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.485
Yeah, I don't think it
was attempted murder.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.487
Heat of the moment.

35:55.521 --> 35:59.358
Which means aggravated assault,
if you confess.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.332
We were both angry

36:06.365 --> 36:08.800
when Chandler told us.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.903
But she-she didn't
meant to do it.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.506
You saying Misty was there?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.842
She-she pushed him,

36:16.875 --> 36:19.545
and-and came back in
and told me everything.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.949
I-I love Misty.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.652
I do.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.555
But...

36:29.588 --> 36:30.456
it was her.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.324
Oh, screw this.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.659
He's lying.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.461
Are you sure about that?

36:35.494 --> 36:37.429
Everything he said did happen,

36:37.463 --> 36:38.930
but it was the other way around.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.868
Yes, I lied.
I was at the apartment.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.537
And after Chandler told us
what happened, we were mad.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.439
But while Seth
went after Chandler,

36:47.473 --> 36:49.775
I went to the table
and got started practicing.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.743
Practicing sleight of hand?

36:51.777 --> 36:53.745
I wasn't gonna let Chandler
ruin a good thing.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.681
And while
I was practicing,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.015
Seth's the one
who came running in

36:57.048 --> 36:58.750
and told me what he did.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.520
Well, it's your word
against your boyfriend's.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.755
He just accused me of murder.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.424
We're no longer dating.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.025
Which sucks for Seth,

37:07.058 --> 37:09.561
because he doesn't know
I've been protecting him.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.863
Protecting him from what?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.432
In order to practice
sleight of hand,

37:13.465 --> 37:15.467
Chandler used
video cameras, so...

37:15.501 --> 37:17.636
I was doing
the same thing.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.339
They were recording
when Seth confessed.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.374
I hid the tape.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.778
Mis... Misty.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.514
You have to help me.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.582
MISTY:
What? What happened?

37:30.616 --> 37:31.817
I-I pushed him.
I pushed him,

37:31.850 --> 37:33.519
and then-then...

37:33.552 --> 37:35.354
then he fell
on-on the stairs.
What?

37:35.387 --> 37:37.656
Gibbs showed that to Seth,

37:37.689 --> 37:40.326
who decided that assault
didn't sound so bad.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.394
Case closed. And...

37:42.428 --> 37:44.863
just in time for Christmas.
(soft chuckle)

37:44.896 --> 37:47.633
So why doesn't this
feel so good?

37:47.666 --> 37:50.602
'Cause the rest of the
family's not home yet.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.840
CHANDLER:
How can they still be missing?

37:54.873 --> 37:58.009
I want to
see my dad.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.878
You have a lot
to tell him.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.281
I want to look him
in the eyes...

38:04.950 --> 38:08.620
...and I want
to tell my father that...

38:08.654 --> 38:10.556
he was right.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.725
Last time
we spoke...

38:13.759 --> 38:17.663
there... there wasn't much love.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.900
I need to change that.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.371
Parents always love their kids.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.440
No matter what happens.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.376
CHET:
Come on.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.877
Don't stop fighting now.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.581
(bird squawking)

38:49.995 --> 38:51.029
What is it?

38:51.062 --> 38:52.631
Vehicles approaching.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.832
Good or bad?

38:53.865 --> 38:56.368
No matter what,

38:56.402 --> 38:58.437
keep quiet.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.701
*

39:33.004 --> 39:35.741
* Come, they told me

39:35.774 --> 39:38.610
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

39:41.947 --> 39:45.617
* Our newborn king to see

39:45.651 --> 39:48.019
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

39:51.757 --> 39:54.092
* Our finest gifts we bring

39:54.125 --> 39:57.629
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

39:59.598 --> 40:01.567
MAN (over P.A.):
Stand by for orders.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.602
* To lay before the king

40:03.635 --> 40:05.003
* Pa-rum pum pum pum...

40:05.036 --> 40:07.739
They recover
the corporal's body?

40:07.773 --> 40:09.808
No man left behind.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.579
*

40:15.113 --> 40:19.751
* So to honor him

40:19.785 --> 40:23.455
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

40:23.489 --> 40:25.724
* When we come

40:26.925 --> 40:28.960
(digging softly)

40:30.962 --> 40:32.964
*

40:42.974 --> 40:45.443
(exhales)

40:57.055 --> 41:00.859
(exhales)

41:07.799 --> 41:09.801
(sighs)

41:17.943 --> 41:19.711
I can go alone.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.012
We go where you go.

41:21.046 --> 41:22.681
Gibbs,
good to see you.

41:22.714 --> 41:23.915
It's been
a long flight.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.517
Only because I no longer need

41:25.551 --> 41:27.218
the security detail.
Or this chair.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.921
And I-I don't know
why we're here.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.524
I told you I want to see my...

41:32.558 --> 41:35.794
* I am a poor boy, too...

41:35.827 --> 41:38.029
Welcome back, sir.

41:40.866 --> 41:44.703
* I have no gift to bring

41:44.736 --> 41:47.873
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

41:50.308 --> 41:52.143
* That's fit to give...

41:52.177 --> 41:54.946
Dad, I am so s...

41:54.980 --> 41:56.948
I love you, son.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.817
* Rum pum pum pum

41:58.850 --> 42:00.852
I love you, too.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.860
* Then he smiled at me

42:08.894 --> 42:13.098
* Pa-rum pum pum pum

42:13.131 --> 42:15.667
* Me and my drum.
