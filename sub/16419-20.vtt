00:21.967 --> 00:23.367
- Okay.
What do I do next?

00:23.467 --> 00:25.867
- Oh! I need to spray
your hands and feet with butter.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.033
- Cool cool.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.967
- Here we go.
Hands.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.567
- Feet.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.967
- Okay. Chew toys are ready.

00:40.067 --> 00:41.567
- And I'm all buttered!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.567
- Yeah, let's do this!

00:43.667 --> 00:47.867
And we are...
Recording.

00:47.967 --> 00:49.633
Game Shakers. Test for new game

00:49.733 --> 00:50.967
called Billy Butterman.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.333
Ramp test, number one.

00:53.433 --> 00:54.333
- Okay, Hudson!

00:54.433 --> 00:56.367
Come and get
the hideous princess!

00:56.467 --> 01:00.233
- One!
- Two! Three!

01:00.333 --> 01:01.867
- C'mon Hudson!
- Go test boy!

01:01.967 --> 01:04.333
- Get this princess!
- Go get her!

01:04.433 --> 01:07.100
- Wait wait wait,
hang on a sec...

01:09.100 --> 01:11.933
Awww fudge balls.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.567
Sorry, I gotta go.
I'll be back in twenty minutes.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.667
- Why ya gotta leave?

01:16.767 --> 01:18.367
- Y'know my three-legged dog?

01:18.467 --> 01:20.133
- Wobbles?
- Yeah.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.967
His prosthetic leg
fell off again.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.509
And then my mom tried
to put it back on,

01:23.533 --> 01:25.733
- Kenzie...
- but Wobbles doesn't like it

01:25.833 --> 01:27.600
when people touch his stump...
- Kenz!

01:27.700 --> 01:30.667
Just go.
- Bye.

01:30.767 --> 01:33.600
- Hey Kenz.
- Yo Kenzie!

01:33.700 --> 01:35.200
- Hey Kenz.

01:35.300 --> 01:38.233
- I can't talk right now,
my dog's leg fell off.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.767
- Uh... so what
you guys laughin' about?

01:46.867 --> 01:48.600
- Yeah, what's so funny?

01:48.700 --> 01:50.133
- What's so funny?

01:50.233 --> 01:52.113
Hey Ruthless, they want
to know what's so funny.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.600
- Will you guys quit
givin' me a hard time?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.433
- Uh, nope!

02:01.267 --> 02:02.627
Ay, so check this out,
all right...

02:02.667 --> 02:05.067
I wanted to buy this
new motorcycle, right?

02:05.133 --> 02:08.300
And, Bunny found it for me
for sale, on the internet...

02:08.400 --> 02:11.900
- So he bought the motorcycle
for Dub to ride!

02:12.067 --> 02:13.587
- Okay, and what's
so funny about Bunny

02:13.633 --> 02:14.933
buying you a new motorcycle?

02:15.067 --> 02:17.367
- Oh! Hey, hey, Bunny...
show 'em.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.500
- He paid $29,000 for that!

02:28.600 --> 02:31.533
Hey... hey who wants to
go for a little ride?!?

02:33.633 --> 02:35.067
Beep beep!

02:35.133 --> 02:38.767
- Okay... okay...
don't be mean.

02:38.867 --> 02:43.800
I'm sure Bunny didn't realize
that the motorcycle was...

02:43.900 --> 02:47.800
teeny.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.133
- Yeah.
I thought it was normal-sized.

02:50.233 --> 02:51.633
- All right, all right,

02:51.733 --> 02:52.909
we've got like a ton
of work to do here, so...

02:52.933 --> 02:54.167
- Oh yeah. We know.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.633
We just came by
to drop off Trip.

02:59.867 --> 03:00.867
- But where's Trip?

03:00.967 --> 03:02.733
- Huh? What?

03:09.100 --> 03:10.333
Where's Trip?

03:10.433 --> 03:12.633
- I guess I forgot to bring him.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.100
- What do you mean
you forgot to bring him?!?

03:15.200 --> 03:18.900
- I... I...
- I! I! I!

03:19.067 --> 03:20.200
- All right, Dub...

03:20.300 --> 03:22.200
lighten up on Bunny, will ya?

03:22.300 --> 03:25.833
- Oh, ya know what...
$29,000!

03:25.933 --> 03:30.133
For a motorcycle!
For ants!

03:30.233 --> 03:32.800
- I know, but let's think
about all the good,

03:32.900 --> 03:34.633
smart things Bunny does for you.

03:34.733 --> 03:37.367
- Oh, okay. Hmmm...

03:37.467 --> 03:39.200
I'm done!

03:39.300 --> 03:41.167
- C'mon Dub, you know I'm smart.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.767
I graduated
from business school.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.767
I know. From Princeton.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.733
- Hey Dub, look...

03:49.833 --> 03:53.567
I found an '88 Dukakis,
and it's still running.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.433
- Yeah, now that's what I want.

03:58.533 --> 04:01.267
Hey Bunny, Hubbins
found me a real motorcycle...

04:01.367 --> 04:04.700
and he didn't even
go to Princeton.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.133
- It's true.

04:06.233 --> 04:09.200
I barely got through
seventh grade.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.209
- Oh, please, Bunny might
get things wrong sometimes,

04:11.233 --> 04:12.500
but he works really hard

04:12.600 --> 04:14.040
and I think you're
lucky to have him.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.500
- Oh, really?
Okay...

04:16.600 --> 04:19.367
So why don't you and I
trade dummies for a while?

04:19.467 --> 04:20.900
- Huh?

04:21.067 --> 04:23.467
- Yeah! Since you think Bunny's
such a "good employee,"

04:23.567 --> 04:25.487
why don't you have him
work here at Game Shakers,

04:25.567 --> 04:28.267
and I'll have Hubbins
come work with me.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.433
- Well... I don't know...

04:29.533 --> 04:31.200
- Ohhhhh!
So when you said,

04:31.300 --> 04:33.267
"Bunny might get things
wrong sometimes

04:33.367 --> 04:35.333
"but he's a really hard worker

04:35.433 --> 04:39.433
and I think you should be lucky
to have him!"

04:39.533 --> 04:42.367
you were just fulla fudge.

04:42.467 --> 04:46.633
- I am not full of fudge.

04:46.733 --> 04:47.733
- Fudge!

04:47.767 --> 04:49.667
- Stop it!

04:49.767 --> 04:51.200
Bunny...

04:51.300 --> 04:53.367
Kenzie and I would love
to have you work with us

04:53.467 --> 04:54.833
at Game Shakers for a while.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.800
- You would?
- Totally.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.267
- Wait! So that means
I get to go work for Dub?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.700
- Yep.
- Whoa!

05:02.800 --> 05:06.067
This setup sounds
like a recipe for hilarity!

05:06.133 --> 05:07.233
- Heh heh, yeah it does.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.100
Come on, Hubbins...
you got work to do.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.733
- Okay!
- Let's go!

05:11.833 --> 05:13.167
- We're gone!

05:13.267 --> 05:14.800
- Bye Kenzie.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.500
- See ya.
- Later Kenzie!

05:18.200 --> 05:20.200
- I couldn't get it
back on my dog.

06:06.933 --> 06:09.433
I was helpin' Bunny
put on his sports suit.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.233
- Hey hey!

06:13.333 --> 06:14.467
- All right Bunny...

06:14.567 --> 06:16.567
your job is to
climb up towards me,

06:16.667 --> 06:20.167
and try to save
this hideous princess.

06:20.267 --> 06:21.467
- Got it.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.267
- Oh wait, you gotta
do the butter spray.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.767
- Oh, right.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.700
- No no, Bunny, stop!
- Aw geez Louise!

06:30.800 --> 06:33.767
- You don't butter your tongue.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.243
- You spray it
on your hands and feet

06:35.267 --> 06:36.267
to make 'em all slippery.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.567
- Oh right, right.

06:41.600 --> 06:46.300
- Okay... Recording.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.200
- Rolling.
- Squeaking.

06:50.067 --> 06:51.500
- Okay. Game Shakers.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.500
Test for new game
called Billy Butterman.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.967
Ramp test, number two.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.333
- Okay, Bunny!
Here's the hideous princess.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.900
You're pretty on the inside.
Come-n-get 'er!

07:01.067 --> 07:04.267
- Woo!
- Go Bunny!

07:04.367 --> 07:06.633
- Do it Bunny!
- Yeah, let's go bunny!

07:06.733 --> 07:09.433
- C'mon!
- Do it Bunny!

07:09.533 --> 07:11.067
- C'mon Bunny!

07:11.100 --> 07:14.300
- Come on Bunny,
she's hideous and she needs you!

07:14.400 --> 07:16.433
- Okay! I'm comin'!

07:19.433 --> 07:21.933
- Ahhhh!

07:22.067 --> 07:24.433
- Help! Help me!
Owwww!

07:24.533 --> 07:27.400
Somebody help me!
My leg!

07:27.500 --> 07:29.200
- I'm pulling!

07:35.133 --> 07:37.467
- So then what happened?!?

07:37.567 --> 07:40.533
- All right, so, I looked
at Melinda, and I said,

07:40.633 --> 07:42.400
"Ay! Melinda...

07:42.500 --> 07:44.400
if you're gonna be sittin'
here in my hot tub,

07:44.500 --> 07:47.333
then you can't be droppin'
all them French fries

07:47.433 --> 07:49.567
in the water!"
- Nuh uh.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.733
- No, not the French fries!

07:54.300 --> 07:56.133
- So then what happened?

07:56.233 --> 07:58.067
- Uhhhh, man, uhhhhhhhh...

07:58.100 --> 07:59.667
How old are you?

07:59.767 --> 08:02.700
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen, hmm...

08:02.800 --> 08:06.800
well, after the hot tub,
Melinda and I...

08:06.900 --> 08:09.767
watched the Jimmy Fallon show...
and... that's all.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.600
- Well...
why didn't you kiss her?

08:14.700 --> 08:16.800
- What! I didn't say
that I didn't get...

08:16.900 --> 08:18.667
What! Ah...
You know what,

08:18.767 --> 08:20.733
what's on the schedule
for today?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.733
- Well, I saw you
had an appointment

08:22.833 --> 08:24.967
today at four o'clock
with your personal trainer?

08:25.067 --> 08:27.267
- Ahhhhhh, dang it,
I forgot all about that.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.100
- Ha! Looks like Dub's
gonna be doin' some exercises!

08:30.200 --> 08:32.567
- Bahhhhhh.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.467
- Uh, actually,
I canceled your workout.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.867
- You canceled it?

08:36.967 --> 08:38.900
- Yeah.
You've been working really hard,

08:39.067 --> 08:41.167
and I felt like you could
use some time to relax.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.100
- Aw, Hubbins!
That was very thoughtful of you.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.133
- Excuse me...
I'm here for Double G.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.367
- Y-you're what?

08:53.467 --> 08:55.533
- KABLAM!!!

08:55.633 --> 08:59.233
- I booked you a massage...
With The Massage Squad.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.067
I hope that's okay.

09:01.100 --> 09:05.067
- A massage?!?
Yeah that's okay!

09:05.133 --> 09:07.200
- Awesome. In here.

09:13.133 --> 09:14.533
- Whatcha thinkin'?

09:14.633 --> 09:17.067
- I'm thinkin'...
Hubbins deserves a huggins.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.300
- Yay!
More spinning!

09:26.367 --> 09:27.433
- Wow dude...

09:27.533 --> 09:30.267
Bunny straight up
broke your leg.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.933
- Yeah, I know.

09:35.067 --> 09:39.267
- He turned your leg
into a two-parter.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.100
- It really hurts.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.667
- I bet.

09:42.767 --> 09:44.833
Hey, will you go grab me
a soda from the fridge?

09:47.733 --> 09:49.067
- But... My leg...
I mean...

09:49.133 --> 09:51.867
- You have crutches.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.967
Go.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.400
- Hey there Game Shakers.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.867
- Hey Kenzie.
- My leg hurts.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.000
- Awwww, no nooooo.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.267
- What's up?
- What's the prob?

10:05.367 --> 10:07.167
- Yesterday, before I left work,

10:07.267 --> 10:10.233
I asked Bunny if he would please
clean my computer keyboard.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.267
- And?

10:15.000 --> 10:18.167
- He scrubbed the dang letters
off the keys.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.367
Okay, what are we
gonna do about Bunny?

10:22.467 --> 10:24.533
- How 'bout we break his leg?

10:24.633 --> 10:28.633
- I'm serious.
He's worse than Hudson.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.633
- Yeah. And at least
when Hudson screws up,

10:30.733 --> 10:31.900
he has the cute little giggle

10:32.000 --> 10:34.067
that somehow makes
everything okay.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.067
Hehehehehe.

10:40.733 --> 10:43.900
- Owww.
- Thanks, Trip.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.900
- No problem.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.333
- Hey everybody!
I picked up the stuff!

10:49.433 --> 10:51.133
- Hey Bunny.
- Picked up what?

10:51.233 --> 10:53.133
- Look, I got the new
Game Shakers T-shirts.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.300
- Oh yeah?
- They're ready?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.167
- They came out really nice.

10:57.267 --> 10:58.433
Check this out...

10:58.533 --> 11:02.233
- Yeah....
- Uh.....

11:02.333 --> 11:04.167
- That's pretty small.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.567
- Yeah, what other
sizes did you get?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.633
- Well, that's the only
size I got.

11:09.733 --> 11:11.333
- Wait wait,

11:11.433 --> 11:14.667
you're sayin' you bought
two hundred of those T-shirts...

11:14.767 --> 11:18.467
All size...
What is size is M-P?

11:18.567 --> 11:20.267
- Mini petite.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.143
- Bunny, just please take
these back to The Shirt Locker

11:26.167 --> 11:28.600
and see if you can exchange them
some for some bigger sizes.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.067
- And see if they have
any leg bone glue.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.700
- Okay.
I'm sorry guys.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.367
- It's okay Bunny!

11:41.467 --> 11:43.833
- Yeah, don't feel bad!

11:43.933 --> 11:46.700
All right, we gotta fire him.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.280
- Yeah, can't we just
get Hudson back?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.533
- Look, I know Bunny's been

11:49.633 --> 11:51.067
messin' up here pretty bad...

11:51.167 --> 11:54.633
but I bet Hudson's making
Dub's life a nightmare.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.667
- Ohhhh...
I'm so happy.

11:59.767 --> 12:04.067
Yeah, this is how
life oughtta be.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.467
Hey! Hubbins!

12:05.567 --> 12:07.167
You're the best!

12:07.267 --> 12:08.833
- Eh, just doin' my job.

12:10.567 --> 12:12.267
- Hey Dub!
Melinda's here!

12:12.367 --> 12:14.333
- What, already?!?

12:14.433 --> 12:16.733
- Get up, hurry! Everybody,
into the recordin' booth!

12:17.967 --> 12:19.209
- Hubbins, help me
get my robe on!

12:19.233 --> 12:21.767
- Sure thing.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.467
- Aww..
- Okay, arm through.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.067
- Okay, you know what to do?
- Yep. Just break up with her.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.867
- Good. I would do it myself,
but I don't want to.

12:34.967 --> 12:37.067
- No worries, I got you.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.300
Hiii. Welcome.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.933
- Hey. I'm Melinda,

12:49.067 --> 12:50.809
Double G called
and asked me to meet him here?

12:50.833 --> 12:53.267
- Right.
Have a seat Melinda.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.233
- Well uh, first,

12:59.333 --> 13:00.973
thanks for coming
in at such short notice.

13:01.067 --> 13:04.233
- Uhhh...
sure, no problem.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.833
So... where's Double G?

13:05.933 --> 13:10.767
- Oh yeah, sorry...
He couldn't be here.

13:10.867 --> 13:14.567
- Well then I don't understand.
Why am I here?

13:14.667 --> 13:16.833
- Look, I'm really sorry,

13:16.933 --> 13:18.409
but Dub can't go out
with you anymore.

13:18.433 --> 13:20.600
- What?

13:20.700 --> 13:21.767
- Don't feel bad.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.833
It's not him.
It's you.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.267
- So, that's it?
I should just leave?

13:29.367 --> 13:32.067
- Well, uh sure. Okay.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.867
- All right then.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.667
- Wait...
did you valet park?

13:42.767 --> 13:45.233
- Uh, yeah.
Here's my ticket.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.433
- We don't validate.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.233
- Ugh!

13:56.433 --> 13:57.600
- So, I handled that okay?

13:57.700 --> 14:00.300
- Okay?!?
Son, I'm thinkin'

14:00.400 --> 14:02.333
you're never goin'
back to Game Shakers...

14:02.433 --> 14:04.333
'cuz I might want you
workin' here with me,

14:04.433 --> 14:05.873
all the time.
Aw, I love you Hubbins.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.367
C'mere, son...

14:09.867 --> 14:17.067
- That's not my name
and I don't even care.

14:17.133 --> 14:18.700
- Oh yeah, and yesterday,

14:18.800 --> 14:20.500
I left a container of my mom's
corn chowder

14:20.600 --> 14:23.133
in the Game Shakers fridge,
and Bunny threw it out.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.533
- Oh yeah, that's
"so much worse"

14:25.633 --> 14:27.833
than havin' Bunny
break your leg.

14:27.933 --> 14:31.167
- Okay okay...
we just need to focus

14:31.267 --> 14:33.267
on getting Hudson to come
back to Game Shakers,

14:33.367 --> 14:35.207
and then Bunny'll go back
to working for Dub...

14:35.233 --> 14:39.633
and then all will be
right with the world again.

14:39.733 --> 14:41.233
Hey hey, here comes Hudson.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.500
- Hey there my little
Game Shakers.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.600
- Hey.
- Sup man.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.167
- Uh... nice coat.

14:51.267 --> 14:53.967
- Thanks.
Dub gave it to me as a bonus.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.867
- Uh-huh.
- That's nice.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.833
- So, we want you to quit
your job working for Dub

15:00.933 --> 15:03.367
and come back to work
at Game Shakers.

15:03.467 --> 15:04.833
- Awww, you guys miss me?

15:04.933 --> 15:05.933
- Heck yeah.
- Totally.

15:05.967 --> 15:07.067
- We really do.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.067
- Well, I can't help ya.

15:11.133 --> 15:12.900
Dub thinks I'm doing
an awesome job,

15:13.067 --> 15:15.867
and he wants to keep me
workin' with him.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.833
- Well, uh, that's cool,

15:17.933 --> 15:20.733
but wouldn't you rather
hang out with us?

15:20.833 --> 15:22.300
- Mm, I dunno.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.567
Like, tomorrow,
guess who I get to meet.

15:24.667 --> 15:25.933
That rapper Two Stains.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.300
- Whaaaaat?
- For serious?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.867
- Two Stains?
- That's way cool, but...

15:29.967 --> 15:33.133
- Hang on,
I gotta go take a wazz.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.900
Kenz, hold my coat, would ya?

15:38.233 --> 15:40.067
- Well, now what
are we gonna do?

15:40.100 --> 15:43.633
- I dunno, but I don't think
he's gonna quit Dub.

15:43.733 --> 15:47.267
- Okay...
If Hudson won't quit my dad,

15:47.367 --> 15:49.833
then we're gonna have to
get my dad to fire Hudson.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.200
- Interesting.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.333
- Got a plan?

15:53.433 --> 15:55.333
- Well, not yet. But...

15:55.433 --> 15:57.767
I know my dad is like dyin'
to work with Two Stains.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.267
So, if Hudson messes that up,

15:59.367 --> 16:01.667
I guarantee you he'll fire him.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.633
- Here he comes.
- Just back me up.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.867
- Cool cool.
- 'Kay-Kay.

16:05.967 --> 16:10.133
- Hey you guys,
Dub texted me during my wazz,

16:10.233 --> 16:11.909
so I really need to...
- Wait, wait, sit down,

16:11.933 --> 16:14.333
- Yeah, sit sit.
- We gotta talk to you.

16:14.433 --> 16:15.867
- What's goin' on?

16:15.967 --> 16:18.500
- Well, you said that Dub
is having a meeting

16:18.600 --> 16:19.767
with Two Stains tomorrow?

16:19.867 --> 16:22.200
- Yeah, why?

16:22.300 --> 16:26.267
- Well...
Two Stains hates Double G.

16:27.667 --> 16:31.400
- Yeah. I bet it's because
of some kind of dispute.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.167
- Anyway...

16:35.267 --> 16:36.909
we're worried that
Two Stains might try to,

16:36.933 --> 16:38.967
y'know, "do somethin'"
to my dad.

16:39.067 --> 16:41.767
- You mean somethin' bad?

16:41.867 --> 16:44.200
- Real bad.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.300
- But wait...
how will I know

16:48.400 --> 16:50.233
if Two Stains
is gonna try somethin'?

16:50.333 --> 16:53.067
- Oh, well...
I read online...

16:53.167 --> 16:56.300
that when Two Stains wants
to "get" someone he hates,

16:56.400 --> 16:59.833
he just reaches
into his jacket pocket...

17:00.067 --> 17:02.067
- Right into his
jacket pocket...

17:02.133 --> 17:05.867
- And pulls out a...
- A thermal grenade!

17:05.967 --> 17:09.967
- Yeah...
a thermal grenade.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.367
- Thermal.

17:11.467 --> 17:14.667
- Well, if anybody
tries to hurt Dub,

17:14.767 --> 17:17.400
they're gonna get
a taste a'these.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.600
Ooo, fruit salad!

17:27.700 --> 17:29.067
- Two Stains!

17:29.167 --> 17:30.733
- Yeah? What's up?

17:30.833 --> 17:32.667
- Uh, I'm Triple G, y'know...

17:32.767 --> 17:35.167
- Oh yeah... you're Dub's kid?

17:35.267 --> 17:37.667
- Uh-huh. So uh...
can you help me out?

17:37.767 --> 17:39.100
- Uhhh...

17:39.200 --> 17:43.833
- I just want you to give
my dad this present.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.867
- This is a red golf ball.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.933
- Well, kinda but not really.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.700
Anyway, as soon as
your meeting's about to end,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.733
give this to my dad.

17:53.833 --> 17:54.900
- Uh, all right.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.600
- And don't say who it's from.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.900
Just say, "Yo Dub, I got
a little present for ya."

17:59.067 --> 18:01.300
- Man, I'm almost sure
this is a golf ball

18:01.400 --> 18:03.267
that someone painted red.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.567
- Right. Now here...
Just keep it in this pocket,

18:06.667 --> 18:09.400
and don't forget to give
it to my dad. All right?

18:13.833 --> 18:16.867
- Two Stains.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.500
- Man, I'm never havin' kids.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.467
- Well, look, I'm thinkin'
that we shoot the whole video

18:24.567 --> 18:26.600
in just three days...
Know what I'm sayin'?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.967
- I hear that.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.600
- So, whatcha thinkin'?

18:30.700 --> 18:32.067
- I'm thinkin' you and me...

18:32.167 --> 18:33.067
we're gonna make a music video.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.867
- Uh-huh, all right then.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.233
- That's right!

18:37.333 --> 18:38.333
- Oh, Dub...
- Hm?

18:38.433 --> 18:40.067
- I got a little present for ya.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.367
- Do you?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.700
- AHHHHHH!!!!!

19:13.067 --> 19:16.600
Nobody! Hurts!

19:19.600 --> 19:22.400
- You acting crazy!
What is wrong with you?

19:22.500 --> 19:27.267
- Why did you rip
Tupac's ukulele off my wall

19:27.367 --> 19:28.867
and beat Two Stains with it?!?

19:28.967 --> 19:31.733
- I was protecting you!
- What?!?

19:34.167 --> 19:35.807
- Wh... what the heck

19:35.900 --> 19:37.367
- Hey... hey Stains, listen,

19:37.467 --> 19:38.909
I don't know what's
wrong with Hubbins.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.233
- Yo man!!!

19:40.333 --> 19:41.543
I don't wanna work with any crew

19:41.567 --> 19:44.867

Tupac's ukulele!

19:44.967 --> 19:46.533
- Yeah, but...

19:53.500 --> 19:56.133
Do you know what you just did?

19:56.233 --> 19:58.333
Do you know how long I've
been workin' to...

20:00.667 --> 20:02.067
- What's wrong?

20:02.167 --> 20:03.276
- It's... it's my allergies...

20:03.300 --> 20:04.460
I'm havin' an allergy attack!

20:04.533 --> 20:06.067
- Dub!!!

20:06.167 --> 20:07.200

20:07.300 --> 20:10.167

20:10.267 --> 20:12.267

20:21.467 --> 20:24.900
- P.S. Who puts shrimp
in trail mix?!

20:25.000 --> 20:27.967

20:30.267 --> 20:32.267

20:46.533 --> 20:48.900
- Huh?!?
- That's a regular pen!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.867
The kind you
use to write a letter,

20:50.967 --> 20:52.433
or leave a friend a note!

20:52.533 --> 20:56.200
