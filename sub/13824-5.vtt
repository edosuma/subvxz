01:29.506 --> 01:31.424
Ah. Hmm?

02:19.264 --> 02:20.849
- Huh?
- Huh?

02:32.026 --> 02:34.070
Mama.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.707
Mama.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.205
Boo.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.438
Mama. Mama.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.810
Huh?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.564
Ah! A mouse!

15:18.125 --> 15:21.086
<i>Millions and millions of years ago...</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:24.256
<i>...giant reptiles ruled the Earth.</i>

15:24.256 --> 15:28.385
<i>Their appetites huge,
their tongues strong.</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:32.222
<i>Life for these armored beasts
was fraught peril and strife.</i>

15:33.349 --> 15:38.145
<i>Dusk for the dinosaur breeds discontent
among these terrible lizards...</i>

15:38.145 --> 15:42.274
<i>...as they fight
against all odds to survive.</i>

15:48.697 --> 15:54.787
<i>Victory is sweet for mere seconds
before another battle is waged.</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:00.459
<i>With the advent of the Ice Age...</i>

16:00.459 --> 16:05.798
<i>...new creatures emerge
to carry on life's eternal struggle.</i>

16:28.445 --> 16:32.324
<i>Only creatures,
strong in both mind and body...</i>

16:32.324 --> 16:36.995
<i>...will lay the foundation
for future generations.</i>

17:09.945 --> 17:13.699
<i>And so fire is discovered...</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:18.370
<i>...allowing the warm-blooded creatures
to weather harsh winters.</i>

17:28.464 --> 17:31.717
<i>If the mother of invention is necessity...</i>

17:32.885 --> 17:37.055
<i>...then desperate mice
require drastic measures...</i>

17:40.309 --> 17:42.227
<i>...of fur.</i>

18:40.077 --> 18:45.332
<i>The bitter cold of winter
gives way to the fresh warmth of spring.</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:48.460
<i>And life begins anew.</i>

19:05.352 --> 19:08.605
<i>The search for food
keeps these primitive creatures...</i>

19:08.605 --> 19:12.609
<i>...on the lookout for any beast
that might make a tasty meal.</i>

19:44.766 --> 19:48.395
<i>But the bold hunters are not successful.</i>

19:57.112 --> 20:00.824
<i>Some days, they are predators.</i>

20:01.783 --> 20:05.537
<i>Other days, they are prey.</i>

20:31.897 --> 20:38.236
<i>Primitive minds join forces
against brutish aggressors.</i>

20:38.236 --> 20:41.198
<i>Good shot, Jerry.</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:55.647
<i>As it was in the beginning and always...</i>

21:57.399 --> 22:00.819
<i>...he who laughs first, laughs last.</i>
