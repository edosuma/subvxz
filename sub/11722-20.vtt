Previously on
"The Secret Circle..."

00:01.654 --> 00:04.234
Each one of your families
has its own crystal.

00:04.236 --> 00:05.685
And they'll be enough
to stop Eben

00:05.687 --> 00:06.954
and the witch hunters?

00:06.955 --> 00:08.355
Your circle,
together with

00:08.357 --> 00:10.357
the power
of 6 crystals,

00:10.359 --> 00:11.992
will destroy them
once and for all.

00:11.994 --> 00:13.794
You aren't the only child
of John Blackwell

00:13.796 --> 00:15.679
in the circle.
What?

00:15.681 --> 00:16.964
It's you.

00:16.966 --> 00:18.749
You're my sister.

00:18.751 --> 00:20.467
Everything
all right, John?

00:20.469 --> 00:22.069
You look
a little pale.

00:22.071 --> 00:23.720
Jane, what did
you do to me?

00:23.722 --> 00:25.472
You're making
a mistake, Charles.

00:25.474 --> 00:27.040
You don't really
want to do this.

00:27.042 --> 00:30.260
Send you to hell?

00:32.214 --> 00:33.764
Jane.

00:33.766 --> 00:35.516
Aah!

00:48.246 --> 00:51.331
It's horrible,
just awful.

01:07.348 --> 01:08.966
It's so awful.

01:08.968 --> 01:11.518
I don't know how Cassie's
keeping it together.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.887
She's tough.

01:13.889 --> 01:16.223
Come on.

01:25.366 --> 01:27.934
Thanks for coming.

01:27.936 --> 01:29.403
Of course.

01:29.405 --> 01:31.338
You ok?

01:31.340 --> 01:36.159
Sure. You're the one
dealing with a tragedy.

01:36.161 --> 01:38.045
I'm so sorry about Jane.

01:38.047 --> 01:39.963
Thanks.

01:39.965 --> 01:42.599
But I know you're dealing
with a lot, too.

01:42.601 --> 01:46.220
You mean like maybe being
a spawn of Blackwell?

01:46.222 --> 01:48.422
Who knows
if it's even true.

01:48.424 --> 01:50.724
I still need to talk
to my real dad.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.342
Well, have you said
anything to the others?

01:52.344 --> 01:54.144
No. And I'm not going to

01:54.146 --> 01:56.597
until I'm sure
there's anything to say.

01:56.599 --> 02:00.734
Diana, you've always
treated me like family.

02:00.736 --> 02:03.090
And I know that things
are really confusing

02:03.115 --> 02:04.973
for you right now,

02:05.074 --> 02:10.594
but if it turns out
that you are my sister,

02:10.596 --> 02:14.197
I'd be really happy
about that.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.702
I'll talk to
you later, ok?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.294
Hey.

02:27.296 --> 02:29.096
Is it true?
Witch hunters did it?

02:29.098 --> 02:30.714
That's
what Blackwell said.

02:30.716 --> 02:32.299
We can't just sit here
and let them

02:32.301 --> 02:33.833
get away with this.

02:33.835 --> 02:35.886
And we won't.

02:35.888 --> 02:39.297
But right now,
there are sad, fragile,

02:39.322 --> 02:40.441
old people here.

02:40.442 --> 02:43.076
Let's not give them a
heart attack with angry threats.

02:43.078 --> 02:48.165
What you need is something
to take the edge off.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.549
No one's safe.

02:49.551 --> 02:52.769
Witch hunters attacking Jane
in her own home.

02:52.771 --> 02:55.572
I can help, you know.

02:55.574 --> 02:57.791
If I had my power back,

02:57.793 --> 02:59.626
we could go after them.

03:01.412 --> 03:03.630
You just worry
about yourself.

03:05.416 --> 03:07.918
It's what
you're best at.

03:30.441 --> 03:31.642
Hi.

03:34.229 --> 03:35.996
I'm sorry.
Do you want to be alone?

03:35.998 --> 03:38.415
No, come on in.
I was just...

03:38.417 --> 03:40.417
just hiding.

03:58.102 --> 04:00.270
She was
an amazing lady.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.643
What hurts the most...

04:09.614 --> 04:13.650
I think what hurts the most
about losing my grandmother is...

04:15.620 --> 04:19.656
is that she's the only thing
I left of my mom.

04:22.910 --> 04:25.495
And now...

04:25.497 --> 04:29.733
I mean, there's no one left alive
really knows me...

04:31.202 --> 04:35.555
When I was me,

04:35.557 --> 04:38.508
before
everything changed.

04:38.510 --> 04:42.979
I may not have known you
before,

04:42.981 --> 04:45.649
but I know you now.

04:47.468 --> 04:51.521
I know who you are,
inside.

04:59.314 --> 05:02.115
Cassie?
You in there?

05:03.501 --> 05:05.669
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

05:05.671 --> 05:08.422
No, it's ok.
It's ok. I get it.

05:08.424 --> 05:10.757
Don't worry.

05:10.759 --> 05:12.375
Cassie?

05:12.377 --> 05:15.595
I was just checking
on you.

05:15.597 --> 05:18.799
I was just heading
back downstairs.

05:27.275 --> 05:29.609
You ok?

05:29.611 --> 05:32.362
Not really.

05:32.364 --> 05:35.348
My grandmother's dead,
and it turns out

05:35.350 --> 05:38.118
that my father has slept
with half of Chance Harbor.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.320
Cassie...

05:40.322 --> 05:42.188
I told you last night,

05:42.190 --> 05:46.743
I was deeply in love
with your mother.

05:46.745 --> 05:52.632
And when we broke up,
I was with Elizabeth once.

05:52.634 --> 05:56.202
And this news is
a shock to me, too.

05:56.204 --> 05:58.922
I will be there for Diana
however I can.

05:58.924 --> 06:02.175
But Amelia was the
love of my life, Cassie,

06:02.177 --> 06:06.029
and you are my daughter, and
none of that is going to change.

06:06.031 --> 06:10.400
And in the meantime,
we cannot lose our focus.

06:10.402 --> 06:14.354
This tragedy shows you just how
close the witch hunters are.

06:17.825 --> 06:20.861
I want
to destroy them,

06:20.863 --> 06:22.629
now more than ever.

06:22.631 --> 06:26.950
We have to find those
last two crystals.

06:38.679 --> 06:41.715
I've noticed mom keeps a bottle
of pills in her purse.

06:41.717 --> 06:44.134
I think they're the reason behind
her random bursts of happiness.

06:44.136 --> 06:46.920
And if anyone needs
a burst right now, it's us.

06:46.922 --> 06:49.723
Problem is, she never lets me
near her Prada.

06:51.425 --> 06:53.460
I'll give it
a little push.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.285
Hmm.
Be right back.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.791
Mom?

07:07.793 --> 07:12.329
I just keep thinking
about Cassie's grandma.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.548
And then, I keep thinking
about grandpa,

07:14.550 --> 07:17.283
and now,
they're both gone.

07:17.285 --> 07:20.954
Don't worry, honey.
It's going to be ok.

07:27.962 --> 07:31.565
Dad? Have you been here
all along?

07:31.567 --> 07:34.184
You missed the entire wake.
Why weren't you there?

07:34.186 --> 07:37.437
Oh, sorry. I got caught up with
some work stuff.

07:39.557 --> 07:41.858
How's Cassie
holding up?

07:41.860 --> 07:45.478
Ok, I guess.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.499
She's going to need you,
more than ever.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.505
I have to ask you
something.

07:55.507 --> 07:59.042
Anything.

08:00.127 --> 08:02.679
What was mom's
relationship, exactly,

08:02.681 --> 08:04.648
with John Blackwell?

08:04.650 --> 08:07.550
What do you mean?

08:09.671 --> 08:12.088
Is there
a chance that...

08:12.090 --> 08:14.841
John Blackwell is
my father?

08:14.843 --> 08:17.994
What?

08:17.996 --> 08:22.282
Where--where is
this coming from?

08:22.284 --> 08:25.669
Cassie
and her father.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.655
Is it possible?

08:30.658 --> 08:32.708
Uh...

08:32.711 --> 08:35.361
Dad?

08:35.363 --> 08:39.365
Your mom and I went
through a rough period.

08:39.366 --> 08:42.552
We separated--
just for a few weeks,

08:42.554 --> 08:46.473
to figure things out.

08:46.475 --> 08:49.042
But when
we got back together,

08:49.044 --> 08:51.678
we were stronger
and happier.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.016
And when
you were born,

08:56.018 --> 08:58.852
it was the best day
of both of our lives.

08:58.854 --> 09:00.070
This isn't happening.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.237
Diana.

09:05.609 --> 09:08.695
I was there when you were born.
I raised you.

09:15.753 --> 09:19.205
I'm your father,
not him.

09:19.207 --> 09:21.758
So whatever
Blackwell said to you--

09:21.760 --> 09:23.460
I haven't talked
to him.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.879
Good. Don't.

09:25.881 --> 09:29.349
He'll do whatever he needs
to earn your trust,

09:29.351 --> 09:30.717
and then, he will prey
on your fears,

09:30.719 --> 09:32.719
and he will manipulate
you into doing things

09:32.721 --> 09:34.587
that you never thought
you'd ever do.

09:34.589 --> 09:37.691
Promise me

09:37.693 --> 09:40.443
that you will stay away
from him.

09:40.445 --> 09:43.063
I will.

09:43.065 --> 09:47.567
You're my daughter,
and I love you.

09:57.661 --> 09:59.245
Adam.

09:59.247 --> 10:01.631
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for this morning,

10:01.633 --> 10:04.334
the way
I kind of attacked you.

10:04.336 --> 10:05.719
I don't know
where that came from.

10:05.721 --> 10:06.886
Please don't apologize,
Cassie.

10:06.888 --> 10:09.506
I'm here for you

10:09.508 --> 10:10.673
no matter what.

10:10.675 --> 10:14.094
Hey. Let's start.

10:16.013 --> 10:17.630
We can find
the last two crystals

10:17.632 --> 10:19.816
without the rest
of the circle.

10:19.818 --> 10:24.320
Your powers, combined with the
crystals we've found so far,

10:24.322 --> 10:28.858
should allow all the crystals
to find each other.

10:28.860 --> 10:32.579
The crystals will refract
their power onto this chart

10:32.581 --> 10:36.416
and pinpoint the location
of them and the other two.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.284
Now, repeat after me.

10:38.286 --> 10:42.405
Thrughain, adhar,

10:42.407 --> 10:44.758
thruagort isham.

10:44.760 --> 10:49.913
Thrughain, adhar,
thruagort isham.

10:52.716 --> 10:53.883
It's working.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.987
There's the 4 crystals
we have here.

10:57.989 --> 11:00.940
And the map's only showing
one of the two remaining.

11:00.942 --> 11:02.275
Where is it?

11:02.277 --> 11:05.628
The house next door
to Cassie's.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.114
Jake's.

11:13.021 --> 11:16.406
This kind of grieving is
more my speed.

11:23.881 --> 11:26.132
But this is
a one-time-only thing.

11:26.134 --> 11:28.334
Oh, yes.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.839
I just hope my mother's
little helpers

11:32.841 --> 11:36.059
will make me feel like
this never happened at all.

11:40.181 --> 11:41.564
What?

11:43.984 --> 11:45.235
Is that...

11:45.237 --> 11:48.571
My family's crystal.

11:54.936 --> 11:57.938
5 down, one to go.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.558
Not exactly.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.861
That one's dead.

12:03.863 --> 12:07.398
I--I might have tested it.
Just to be sure.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.866
Where did you
find this?

12:08.868 --> 12:10.067
In my mom's purse.

12:10.069 --> 12:12.787
Ok. So now,
we just have to find

12:12.789 --> 12:14.205
Adam's family's
crystal.

12:14.207 --> 12:16.023
But it didn't appear
on the map.

12:16.025 --> 12:18.576
It must be cloaked.
Adam's grandfather could've spelled

12:18.578 --> 12:20.211
and hidden it
before he died.

12:20.213 --> 12:21.912
What if
we can't find it?

12:21.914 --> 12:23.297
We have to.

12:23.299 --> 12:24.882
Maybe your grandfather
left a clue

12:24.884 --> 12:26.700
that might help us figure out
his cloaking spell

12:26.702 --> 12:29.303
or at least give us an idea of
where he hid it.

12:29.305 --> 12:30.971
I could look.

12:30.973 --> 12:32.590
Yeah, but even
if we find it,

12:32.592 --> 12:33.974
Faye's crystal
doesn't have any power.

12:33.976 --> 12:35.559
I know a spell
we can recharge it with,

12:35.561 --> 12:37.211
but we need
the entire circle.

12:37.213 --> 12:40.047
You find Diana.
Let's meet back here tonight.

12:40.049 --> 12:43.050
Adam, we need
that sixth crystal.

12:43.052 --> 12:44.435
We can't make
the crystal skull

12:44.437 --> 12:46.187
or protect ourselves
without it.

13:00.051 --> 13:02.303
You didn't answer
the door.

13:02.305 --> 13:05.840
Or phone, or texts.

13:07.909 --> 13:11.111
I told my father
about Blackwell.

13:11.113 --> 13:12.796
What happened?

13:12.798 --> 13:15.366
It was terrible.

13:15.368 --> 13:17.635
He had no idea.

13:17.637 --> 13:19.370
Is he ok?

13:19.372 --> 13:22.439
I just told him that the man
he hates most in the world

13:22.441 --> 13:25.025
slept with his wife.

13:25.027 --> 13:27.811
Anyway, what's
the emergency?

13:27.813 --> 13:30.181
I take it
there is one.

13:30.183 --> 13:32.266
Faye found
her family crystal.

13:32.268 --> 13:34.785
But we need the whole circle
to recharge it.

13:34.787 --> 13:36.820
My father's going
to show us how.

13:36.822 --> 13:40.724
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

13:40.726 --> 13:41.992
What?

13:41.994 --> 13:43.827
Is it smart to do absolutely
everything

13:43.829 --> 13:45.679
Blackwell
tells us to?

13:45.681 --> 13:48.165
Well, it's the only way we know
how to stop the witch hunters.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.733
What if it isn't
the only way?

13:52.121 --> 13:55.756
Look, I know
that you're upset.

13:55.758 --> 13:58.792
But the witch hunters
are closer than ever.

13:58.794 --> 14:01.495
They killed my grandmother
last night.

14:01.497 --> 14:04.014
We need to
protect ourselves.

14:04.016 --> 14:07.851
And we need you
to help us do it.

14:09.521 --> 14:10.988
What are
we looking for?

14:10.990 --> 14:12.472
No idea.

14:12.474 --> 14:14.491
I don't know anything about
my grandfather,

14:14.493 --> 14:16.143
except that
he built this place,

14:16.145 --> 14:17.945
and he taught history
at the high school.

14:17.947 --> 14:21.081
And apparently, he liked to
hide important things

14:21.083 --> 14:22.750
with cloaking spells,

14:22.752 --> 14:24.151
so it seems unlikely
he'd just leave

14:24.153 --> 14:25.819
important clues
lying around.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.421
You know what? Don't worry.
We'll find something.

14:27.423 --> 14:29.840
Or we won't,
and it'll be my fault

14:29.842 --> 14:31.759
that we can't put
the crystals together.

14:31.761 --> 14:34.795
Are you ok?

14:34.797 --> 14:37.014
Cassie...

14:37.016 --> 14:39.600
She...

14:39.602 --> 14:41.185
kissed me today.

14:41.187 --> 14:45.856
Like--like,
a full-on, real kiss?

14:45.858 --> 14:47.858
Look, it was
an emotional morning,

14:47.860 --> 14:50.444
and I'm sure it didn't
mean anything.

14:50.446 --> 14:51.845
Why are you sure?

14:51.847 --> 14:55.449
We drank an elixir,
remember?

14:55.451 --> 14:58.235
Made us forget
our feelings, so...

15:01.906 --> 15:05.159
Look, can just we forget
I said anything?

15:05.161 --> 15:08.329
I think I have an elixir that
will help with that.

15:11.266 --> 15:12.933
It's the middle
of the day.

15:12.935 --> 15:16.920
Yeah, a really hard,
emotionally draining day

15:16.922 --> 15:18.705
that started
with a wake

15:18.707 --> 15:20.540
because the witch hunters
are already here

15:20.542 --> 15:22.977
and killing
the people we love.

15:22.979 --> 15:25.312
Maybe this'll help
loosen us up

15:25.314 --> 15:28.349
so we can get into
your grandpa's head.

15:32.270 --> 15:35.105
So what part of "we need
to recharge the crystals

15:35.107 --> 15:38.075
before the witch hunters
kill us" doesn't Diana understand?

15:38.077 --> 15:40.110
I'm sure
she has her reasons.

15:40.112 --> 15:42.279
Oh, like what?
Buying more push-up bras?

15:42.281 --> 15:44.748
Brushing up on
her Aussie accent?

15:44.750 --> 15:47.501
Not exactly.

15:47.503 --> 15:50.421
I've been dealing with
something personal.

15:50.423 --> 15:51.588
So have we.

15:51.590 --> 15:54.258
Personally,
I don't want to die.

15:57.912 --> 16:02.049
John Blackwell is
my father.

16:02.051 --> 16:03.100
Since when?

16:03.102 --> 16:04.218
What are you
talking about?

16:04.220 --> 16:05.969
I found out at the mine.

16:05.971 --> 16:07.688
I couldn't get in,
like Cassie,

16:07.690 --> 16:09.823
because we're related.

16:09.825 --> 16:11.692
Your grandfather
was right.

16:11.694 --> 16:13.727
And she's the one.

16:13.729 --> 16:15.529
How is this fair?

16:15.531 --> 16:17.348
Right about what?

16:17.350 --> 16:18.782
He had a theory
that Blackwell had

16:18.784 --> 16:20.584
more than one child
in our circle.

16:20.586 --> 16:21.835
Why didn't you
tell me?

16:21.837 --> 16:23.287
He had
a lot of theories,

16:23.289 --> 16:24.822
most of them crazy.

16:24.824 --> 16:27.157
But not all,
apparently.

16:27.159 --> 16:28.759
And according to
my mom's journal,

16:28.761 --> 16:32.129
Blackwell might have had
something with her, too.

16:33.131 --> 16:34.631
Your daddy got around.

16:34.633 --> 16:36.216
And this is the guy
we're supposed to be trusting

16:36.218 --> 16:37.468
to save us from
the witch hunters?

16:37.470 --> 16:39.269
He's saved us
from them once.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.238
We'd be dead if
it weren't for him.

16:42.808 --> 16:45.259
What the hell's
going on?

16:51.516 --> 16:53.233
Cassie,
are you doing this?

16:53.235 --> 16:55.819
No!

16:57.906 --> 17:00.741
What the hell?
The crystal!

17:15.757 --> 17:17.590
It's gone.

17:23.911 --> 17:25.744
We got totally
out-magicked

17:25.747 --> 17:27.363
in our own magic house.

17:27.365 --> 17:28.581
Unbelievable.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.750
It was witch hunters.

17:30.752 --> 17:32.785
There's ash around
the whole house.

17:32.787 --> 17:34.453
But the crystal was
stolen using magic.

17:34.455 --> 17:36.172
It must've been
the traitor witch.

17:36.174 --> 17:37.573
And why would
the traitor want it?

17:37.575 --> 17:39.008
To give themselves
more power.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.376
Or to stop us
from putting together

17:40.378 --> 17:41.577
the crystal skull.

17:41.579 --> 17:43.179
We have
to get it back.

17:43.181 --> 17:44.213
How?

17:44.215 --> 17:46.799
Isaac.

17:46.801 --> 17:49.402
I can talk to him.

17:49.404 --> 17:51.370
Really?
Is a witch hunter

17:51.372 --> 17:53.503
the best guy to help us
steal something

17:53.528 --> 17:54.925
from witch hunters?

17:54.926 --> 17:57.460
I know Isaac doesn't believe
in what Eben's doing.

17:57.462 --> 17:59.812
Demons, using magic--

17:59.814 --> 18:02.348
those are the things he
dedicated his life to stop.

18:02.350 --> 18:03.783
Why hasn't
he stopped Eben?

18:03.785 --> 18:05.868
Maybe Eben's too strong.

18:05.870 --> 18:09.105
If I can convince Isaac
we can stop Eben

18:09.107 --> 18:10.873
by putting together
the crystals,

18:10.875 --> 18:13.559
maybe he'll help us get
that crystal back.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.595
Anyone have
another idea?

18:16.597 --> 18:18.881
I think
it's worth a shot.

18:18.883 --> 18:21.550
Ok. I'll run it
by my father.

18:21.552 --> 18:24.003
No.

18:24.005 --> 18:25.621
We were a circle
before he got here,

18:25.623 --> 18:27.139
we can handle this
on our own.

18:27.141 --> 18:29.725
Maybe we don't need
Blackwell on this one.

18:29.727 --> 18:31.894
Isaac would never
trust him.

18:31.896 --> 18:35.314
Maybe Isaac's
smarter than we are.

18:55.368 --> 18:59.171
John? It's Charles.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.875
When Cassie
kissed you,

19:02.877 --> 19:06.512
did you feel
anything...

19:06.514 --> 19:08.581
Romantic?

19:08.583 --> 19:10.466
No.

19:10.468 --> 19:12.941
There was something
between the two of you

19:12.966 --> 19:14.387
from the beginning.

19:14.388 --> 19:19.041
Maybe it'll just keep developing,
like for the first time,

19:19.043 --> 19:22.978
no matter how hard
you try to forget it.

19:31.822 --> 19:35.407
There's a curse on us.

19:35.409 --> 19:38.377
If we started

19:38.379 --> 19:41.881
developing
feelings again,

19:41.883 --> 19:44.650
someone in the circle
could die.

19:52.058 --> 19:55.728
That was my grandpa's.

19:55.730 --> 19:58.063
That was his lucky coin.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.887
He always had it on him.

20:04.889 --> 20:07.022
I remember...

20:07.024 --> 20:09.191
He used to do
this trick

20:09.193 --> 20:13.195
where he'd hold it
out from my ear,

20:13.197 --> 20:17.867
and then, he'd move it
around his hands...

20:17.869 --> 20:21.069
And he would make it--

20:21.071 --> 20:22.421
Cloaked?

20:22.423 --> 20:24.623
But how did
he do it?

20:24.625 --> 20:27.743
I think
it went something like...

20:40.807 --> 20:43.192
Ok.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.742
It's cloaked.
You cloaked it.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.744
That's incredible.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.748
I can feel it. It's still here
in my hand.

21:06.918 --> 21:09.218
How do you uncloak it?

21:11.338 --> 21:13.422
I don't know.

21:20.430 --> 21:24.132
No Isaac.

21:24.134 --> 21:25.801
Unless they're here,

21:25.803 --> 21:28.570
and this is a trap.
They're just waiting to kill us.

21:28.572 --> 21:31.023
That's not
who Isaac is.

21:31.025 --> 21:32.641
Trust me.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.812
Who the hell is that?

21:40.784 --> 21:42.251
Ian.

21:42.253 --> 21:44.703
The last time one of
your buddies showed up,

21:44.705 --> 21:46.088
he had a demon
inside him.

21:46.090 --> 21:49.091
Just let me
talk to him.

21:49.093 --> 21:51.326
We have no other way
to get answers.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.843
You want to talk?

22:07.845 --> 22:11.013
You son of a bitch.

22:11.015 --> 22:14.116
I am Diana's father.

22:14.118 --> 22:16.702
I never planned
on telling her.

22:16.704 --> 22:18.787
She figured it out
on her own.

22:18.789 --> 22:21.457
Elizabeth was my wife.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.796
We're in a public
place, Charles.

22:27.798 --> 22:30.198
What are you going
to do? Hit me?

22:42.062 --> 22:44.813
You think this will let you
control her, don't you?

22:44.815 --> 22:48.767
She's too smart for that.
She's too good for that.

22:50.387 --> 22:52.771
I can destroy you.

22:52.773 --> 22:55.657
Yeah?
Look around me, John.

22:55.659 --> 22:57.276
'Cause if you do
anything to me,

22:57.278 --> 22:58.777
Diana will know
it was you.

22:58.779 --> 23:03.365
Everyone will know.
You can't touch me.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.346
I'm going to take
Diana as far away from

23:07.371 --> 23:09.039
Chance Harbor as possible.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.207
You'll never see her again.

23:36.566 --> 23:38.200
Jake.

23:38.202 --> 23:39.768
Ian.

23:39.770 --> 23:41.170
I'm sorry about Samuel.

23:41.172 --> 23:43.655
It was
a senseless death.

23:43.657 --> 23:45.824
Is that why you called?

23:45.826 --> 23:47.559
A condolence card
would've been fine.

23:47.561 --> 23:50.829
I called Isaac.
Why are you here?

23:50.831 --> 23:53.782
Because Isaac's dead.

23:53.784 --> 23:56.585
What?

23:56.587 --> 23:57.953
Eben killed him.

23:57.955 --> 23:59.671
He's lying.
He's messing with you.

23:59.673 --> 24:02.174
I know you. You wore
a pig mask on Halloween.

24:02.176 --> 24:03.625
You chloroformed me.

24:03.627 --> 24:07.229
You took us to a boat yard and
tried to burn us.

24:07.231 --> 24:08.597
You called me.
What do you want?

24:08.599 --> 24:10.766
You know where
my house is.

24:10.768 --> 24:13.602
You killed
my grandmother.

24:13.604 --> 24:15.070
Cassie.

24:15.072 --> 24:18.473
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:18.475 --> 24:21.443
More lies.

24:21.445 --> 24:22.911
You're
a murderer.

24:22.913 --> 24:24.530
And what does that
make you?

24:24.532 --> 24:27.816
You killed Luke.
You lit him up like a Tor--

24:34.174 --> 24:35.591
What--what
are you doing?

24:35.593 --> 24:38.177
Wait, Cassie!
Stop! Cassie!

24:38.179 --> 24:40.512
You're going to kill--

24:40.514 --> 24:43.048
Cassie, stop!
What are you doing? Stop--

24:44.334 --> 24:47.636
Stop!

25:00.896 --> 25:02.641
He tried to kill us
on Halloween,

25:02.646 --> 25:03.928
and he killed
my grandmother.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.196
You don't know that.

25:05.815 --> 25:07.315
And your dark magic
almost ruined

25:07.317 --> 25:09.350
any chance we had of
getting the crystal back.

25:09.352 --> 25:11.436
Keep her the hell
away from me!

25:11.438 --> 25:14.388
That's the witch
you left us for?

25:14.390 --> 25:15.690
You're pathetic, Jake.

25:15.692 --> 25:17.525
Why did Eben
kill Isaac?

25:17.527 --> 25:19.494
Because Isaac
turned on him.

25:19.496 --> 25:22.780
Isaac believed that all
magic was rooted in evil.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.500
He hated that Eben
was using it.

25:25.502 --> 25:27.952
The magic Eben got
from the witch traitor.

25:27.954 --> 25:30.455
After the witch helped Eben
summon the demons,

25:30.457 --> 25:32.406
he no longer useful.

25:32.408 --> 25:36.227
Eben told Isaac to kill him,
but Isaac didn't.

25:36.229 --> 25:38.813
The witch escapes. Eben
killed Isaac as punishment.

25:38.815 --> 25:41.549
Who was the traitor?

25:41.551 --> 25:44.135
Never found out.

25:44.137 --> 25:46.354
I tracked the witch
to Chance Harbor.

25:46.356 --> 25:47.722
I lost him.
With any luck,

25:47.724 --> 25:49.557
he's here to kill
all of you.

25:49.559 --> 25:50.908
Maybe we should get
Cassie back here, huh?

25:50.910 --> 25:52.109
Look, I only came here

25:52.111 --> 25:53.778
out of respect for Isaac,
all right?

25:53.780 --> 25:57.398
I know
how close you were.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.037
Hey! He can't just leave!
What the hell?

26:03.039 --> 26:05.573
That's it?

26:05.575 --> 26:07.208
What, you're just
letting him walk away?

26:07.210 --> 26:09.327
- We got what we needed.
- What?

26:09.329 --> 26:12.213
We know the traitor wasn't bringing
the crystal to the hunters,

26:12.215 --> 26:14.382
which means
he was on his own.

26:14.384 --> 26:16.801
We can track it
and bring it back.

26:16.803 --> 26:18.586
Wait.
If Isaac turned on Eben,

26:18.588 --> 26:20.588
maybe Ian and the others
who were loyal to Isaac

26:20.590 --> 26:22.289
can be convinced
to turn, too.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.975
A truce? Really?

26:23.977 --> 26:26.277
Don't you remember how that
worked out for our parents?

26:26.279 --> 26:28.980
Maybe annihilation isn't the
only way to stop this war.

26:28.982 --> 26:30.815
Let's just find
the crystal.

26:30.817 --> 26:32.266
Putting together
the crystal skull

26:32.268 --> 26:33.901
gives us leverage
either way.

26:44.496 --> 26:46.313
Even if we find it,

26:46.315 --> 26:48.432
how are we going to get the
crystal away from the traitor?

26:48.434 --> 26:49.901
There's 4 of us
and one of him.

26:49.903 --> 26:51.402
Oh, and I forgot,

26:51.404 --> 26:54.455
we've got the dark magic
super twins on our side.

26:54.457 --> 26:55.456
Hardly.

26:55.458 --> 26:56.924
What does
that mean?

26:56.926 --> 26:59.727
Even if I have dark magic,
I'd never use it.

26:59.729 --> 27:01.746
We're
very different people.

27:01.748 --> 27:03.915
Oh, come on, Diana,

27:03.917 --> 27:06.584
at least try it.
Destroy something!

27:06.586 --> 27:11.005
Let's just concentrate
on finding the crystal. Ok?

27:26.471 --> 27:28.188
It's near
Hudson Fields.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.740
Where is that?

27:29.742 --> 27:32.476
Uh, the creepiest place
on earth.

27:34.062 --> 27:37.582
Are you sure you're doing
it exactly like he did it?

27:37.584 --> 27:40.301
He would--
he would say something

27:40.303 --> 27:42.219
to make it reappear.

27:42.221 --> 27:44.088
Maybe what was
written on the coin?

27:44.090 --> 27:45.673
Look,
I don't remember.

27:45.675 --> 27:48.359
I was too busy being amazed
at it disappearing.

27:49.846 --> 27:52.480
Wait.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.024
Brilliant.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.444
That's it.

28:06.446 --> 28:08.228
- There. Right?
- Yeah.

28:09.581 --> 28:13.951
Hic tamen non hic.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.287
Ostendo.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.678
It worked.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.218
And on more
than just the coin.

28:31.220 --> 28:34.221
What do you mean?
Wow. Adam, what is that?

28:34.223 --> 28:40.811
It's a freshly uncloaked
secret panel.

28:41.730 --> 28:44.365
You're
an uncloaking genius.

28:45.817 --> 28:48.653
What happened
to your face?

28:48.655 --> 28:51.271
Charles.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.041
Why would he do that?

28:54.043 --> 28:57.211
He found out that...

28:57.213 --> 29:00.114
that Diana is
my daughter.

29:00.116 --> 29:03.551
What?

29:03.553 --> 29:05.503
You and Elizabeth?

29:08.289 --> 29:10.257
You and I tried, Dawn.

29:10.259 --> 29:12.243
It just wasn't meant
to be.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.147
And you never did forgive me
for that, did you?

29:16.149 --> 29:18.833
That's not true,
at all.

29:18.835 --> 29:22.536
But now,
I need your help.

29:22.538 --> 29:25.006
Charles is going to take Diana
and leave town.

29:25.008 --> 29:27.558
I need you to keep
that from happening.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.077
Why?

29:30.079 --> 29:32.013
Diana can't leave.

29:32.015 --> 29:34.448
I need a full circle
to assemble the skull

29:34.450 --> 29:36.050
and defeat
the witch hunters.

29:36.052 --> 29:38.035
So you are trying
to finish

29:38.037 --> 29:39.920
what we couldn't do
16 years ago.

29:39.922 --> 29:42.573
This circle is much
stronger than yours.

29:42.575 --> 29:45.159
Why, because
your own children are in it?

29:45.161 --> 29:48.345
Help me now, Dawn,

29:48.347 --> 29:50.381
and I'll get you
your power back.

29:50.383 --> 29:53.184
And everything
will be right.

29:53.186 --> 29:54.969
Even if we defeat
the witch hunters,

29:54.971 --> 29:57.471
The Elders will never
allow that to happen.

29:57.473 --> 30:00.507
They won't be around
to object.

30:00.509 --> 30:02.226
After the witch
hunters are gone,

30:02.228 --> 30:04.445
we're going
to eliminate The Elders.

30:04.447 --> 30:06.063
It'll be just like
we dreamed.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.648
No more hiding.

30:07.650 --> 30:09.650
Out of
the broom closet,

30:09.652 --> 30:11.819
as you always used
to say.

30:13.990 --> 30:16.373
Is that why
you stole my crystal?

30:16.375 --> 30:18.292
I didn't steal
your crystal.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.294
Faye gave it to me.

30:20.296 --> 30:24.231
Faye?

30:24.233 --> 30:28.368
I didn't realize the children
were being so helpful.

30:29.921 --> 30:32.473
It's your help
I need now, Dawn.

30:32.475 --> 30:36.510
I'll talk to Charles.

30:45.604 --> 30:47.188
Here.

30:54.229 --> 30:57.248
You're a master elder
with a badass cloaking spell,

30:57.250 --> 30:59.950
and you use it to hide
your girlie mags?

30:59.952 --> 31:01.952
It's not here.

31:01.954 --> 31:05.005
If the spell uncloaked everything
my grandfather cloaked,

31:05.007 --> 31:06.907
and the crystal is
not here,

31:06.909 --> 31:09.844
then where is it?

31:09.846 --> 31:11.512
Do you know
what we need?

31:11.514 --> 31:13.380
- Another drink?
- No.

31:13.382 --> 31:17.417
The crystal-locating map.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.148
This is Hudson Fields?

31:31.150 --> 31:32.900
Are you sure
he's even in there?

31:32.902 --> 31:34.935
The crystal definitely is,
and that's all we need.

31:34.937 --> 31:38.956
I've had at least a dozen
nightmares start this way.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.774
And most of them
involve you.

31:40.776 --> 31:43.210
Come on.

31:43.212 --> 31:47.498
Ok. But if I run into any kind
of clown, I'm so out of here.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.500
Faye.

32:09.586 --> 32:12.554
If we live, remind me
to download this song.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.808
It'd be perfect for my "Running
for your life" treadmill mix.

32:24.884 --> 32:27.019
Let's split up.

32:27.021 --> 32:29.004
Find him faster.

32:29.006 --> 32:30.889
- I'll go with Faye.
- Oh, no.

32:30.891 --> 32:33.992
I wouldn't dream of coming in
between the Blackwell sisters.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.495
So that means
it's you and me.

32:36.497 --> 32:41.116
Wow. Your enthusiasm
is overwhelming.

32:41.118 --> 32:42.868
Check some rides?

32:42.870 --> 32:45.254
That sounded
a lot more romantic

32:45.256 --> 32:47.506
when you took me here
two years ago.

32:47.508 --> 32:51.960
I really doubt I had romance
on my mind back then.

33:06.026 --> 33:09.394
False alarm.
Just a disgusting rat.

33:09.396 --> 33:11.897
Scooby and shaggy
are such scaredy-cats.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.958
Going on a trip?

33:22.960 --> 33:27.162
I'm taking Diana
out of town for a while.

33:27.164 --> 33:29.264
What are you
doing here?

33:29.266 --> 33:31.850
Seeing if you're ok.

33:31.852 --> 33:34.503
Half the town saw your tussle
with Blackwell.

33:34.505 --> 33:37.506
Blackwell's the reason
I'm leaving town.

33:37.508 --> 33:39.808
What happened?
What did he say?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.227
I'm not going to talk about
John Blackwell with you.

33:42.229 --> 33:46.181
You have a bigger blind spot
for him than any of us.

33:46.183 --> 33:49.101
Please. Just...

33:49.103 --> 33:51.253
Tell me what's going on.

33:51.255 --> 33:55.274
He's trying to
take Diana away.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.327
He wants
our children, Dawn.

33:58.329 --> 34:00.112
He wants his own
private army of witches

34:00.114 --> 34:01.513
to do his bidding

34:01.515 --> 34:04.082
and get him the power
he's always craved.

34:04.084 --> 34:07.502
Diana is the one good thing
in my life,

34:07.504 --> 34:10.621
and I will never let him
take her.

34:15.378 --> 34:18.030
I'm losing Faye, too.

34:18.032 --> 34:21.617
She stole my crystal, and
she brought it to him.

34:23.319 --> 34:25.387
Blackwell has them
working for him in secret,

34:25.389 --> 34:28.389
just like he did to us.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.360
And this is our fault.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.178
We brought Cassie here
so we could use

34:33.179 --> 34:35.179
the power of their circle to get
our strength back.

34:35.181 --> 34:37.949
And all we've done is
hand their power right to him.

34:37.952 --> 34:41.152
I'm well aware.

34:41.155 --> 34:43.021
And I'm leaving.

34:43.023 --> 34:46.308
No matter where you go,
the circle will still be bound

34:46.310 --> 34:49.860
Diana will still be
connected to them.

34:49.862 --> 34:54.666
This is our responsibility.
We have got to stop him.

34:54.668 --> 34:59.037
He will use our children
however he wants to--

34:59.039 --> 35:01.340
no matter what the cost.

35:01.342 --> 35:03.842
Except this time,
it won't be

35:03.844 --> 35:07.329
Tom and Elizabeth
who end up dead.

35:07.331 --> 35:11.366
It'll be Faye and Diana.

35:14.237 --> 35:17.439
You do remember
our date here, right?

35:17.441 --> 35:19.608
Red dress.

35:19.610 --> 35:21.526
Of course I remember.

35:24.864 --> 35:28.000
Oh.

35:28.002 --> 35:31.036
Seriously?
This scares you?

35:31.038 --> 35:33.005
Clowns? Yes.

35:33.007 --> 35:37.526
Their painted-on faces,
their freakishly large feet.

35:37.528 --> 35:40.545
I could go on.

35:40.547 --> 35:43.532
What's that?

35:47.470 --> 35:49.871
Hey.

35:49.873 --> 35:51.473
Hey!

35:54.260 --> 35:55.861
Ian.

35:58.597 --> 36:00.549
He's dead.

36:00.551 --> 36:02.150
Let's turn on
the power.

36:25.958 --> 36:28.427
Oh, my God.

36:28.429 --> 36:29.511
Who are they?

36:29.513 --> 36:31.680
Witch hunters.

36:31.682 --> 36:34.716
I guess the traitor witch is
looking to kill them and us.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.408
So now the traitor will just
kill anyone?

36:46.664 --> 36:47.780
What happened
to him?

36:47.782 --> 36:49.031
He's more messed up
than you were.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.232
Let's ask him about it
after we get the crystal.

36:53.851 --> 36:55.435
Blood.

36:58.022 --> 37:00.390
Jake.

37:02.043 --> 37:04.444
Let's follow it.

37:04.446 --> 37:06.463
Stay close.

37:16.824 --> 37:19.042
What are you two
doing here?

37:19.044 --> 37:21.878
You were right about
the cloaking spell.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.847
Adam lifted it.

37:23.849 --> 37:26.750
I think we found
the last crystal.

37:26.752 --> 37:29.152
I hope you're right.

37:30.871 --> 37:34.424
It's somewhere in
the high school.

37:36.727 --> 37:38.728
I don't hear anyone.

37:38.730 --> 37:40.730
Good.

37:59.918 --> 38:02.752
Worst. House. Ever.

38:05.122 --> 38:08.341
Look, a door.

38:13.647 --> 38:17.734
Without Ian, I guess your truce
isn't going to work out.

38:17.736 --> 38:20.103
They never seem to.

38:20.105 --> 38:22.105
Not if people
can't stop killing.

38:22.107 --> 38:24.757
Are you trying
to say something?

38:24.759 --> 38:27.010
Ever since
your father got here,

38:27.012 --> 38:29.379
you've lost sense
of what is right.

38:29.381 --> 38:31.614
You're letting your dark magic
take hold of you,

38:31.616 --> 38:33.416
and it scares me.

38:33.418 --> 38:37.620
Diana,
he's our father.

38:38.789 --> 38:42.959
Wait. That's what
this is about.

38:42.961 --> 38:44.761
What you're really
afraid of is that

38:44.763 --> 38:46.629
you'll end up
just like me.

38:46.631 --> 38:48.431
No.

38:48.433 --> 38:50.450
I couldn't kill
anyone.

38:50.452 --> 38:52.835
You think
it's that easy?

38:52.837 --> 38:55.588
To hurt someone?
Anyone?

38:55.590 --> 38:58.858
Don't forget, my dark magic is
what saved your life.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.426
That witch hunter
back there,

39:00.428 --> 39:02.512
him and his friends, they were
going to light a cruet.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.764
And torch you
on Halloween, ok?

39:04.766 --> 39:06.382
So just back off
on the judgment

39:06.384 --> 39:08.384
until your best friend
is about to die.

39:08.386 --> 39:10.186
And then, tell me
how much dark magic

39:10.188 --> 39:11.971
you would or wouldn't use
to save

39:11.973 --> 39:15.858
the few people left
that you truly care about.

39:15.860 --> 39:18.945
Diana,
we're in this together,

39:18.947 --> 39:22.248
whether you like it
or not.

39:24.034 --> 39:27.853
You're right.
We are in this together.

39:27.855 --> 39:30.056
But killing is wrong.

39:30.058 --> 39:33.159
And I'm going to keep
reminding you of that.

39:36.630 --> 39:37.914
The traitor.

39:41.251 --> 39:42.635
Come on!

39:56.266 --> 39:58.885
Something's
not right here.

40:00.371 --> 40:01.821
The sway.

40:08.379 --> 40:11.230
This is what transfers power
from witches to mortals.

40:11.232 --> 40:14.117
It's called a sway.

40:14.119 --> 40:17.820
This is definitely where the
traitor witch has been hiding out.

40:17.822 --> 40:20.039
We don't want
to hurt you.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.958
All we want is
the crystal.

40:21.960 --> 40:24.577
He's trapped.

40:40.561 --> 40:42.528
Faye.

40:49.787 --> 40:52.822
Why would the witch have a
photograph of my parents?

41:09.673 --> 41:11.891
Cassie, please.

41:17.514 --> 41:19.232
Please.

41:24.271 --> 41:26.272
You stopped it
from killing him.

41:26.274 --> 41:28.524
I hope that wasn't
a mistake.

41:43.657 --> 41:45.625
Nick?

41:48.712 --> 41:50.880
He's alive?
