00:07.908 --> 00:10.076
(horns honking)

00:11.378 --> 00:12.445
Come on!

00:12.447 --> 00:13.613
Get out of the street!

00:13.615 --> 00:15.381
Let's go!

00:15.383 --> 00:17.550
Get out of the damn street,
you freakin' lunatic!

00:17.552 --> 00:20.453
Yo, somebody get a net
for this whackjob, huh?

00:20.455 --> 00:22.188
Hey, pipe down, okay?

00:22.190 --> 00:23.823
Come on, lady!
We're taking care of it.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.658
(horn honks)

00:25.660 --> 00:26.659
Looks like an EDP.

00:26.661 --> 00:27.793
Some kind of
mental disorder.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.061
I hate these
kind of calls.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.363
How do you want
to handle it?

00:30.365 --> 00:31.897
Let's try and
talk to her.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.066
Hey...
Excuse us...

00:34.068 --> 00:35.101
Hey, excuse me.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.135
Excuse us.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.737
Where is it?

00:37.739 --> 00:38.704
They said it was

00:38.706 --> 00:40.206
going to be here,

00:40.208 --> 00:41.207
it's supposed to be here.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.241
Did you lose
something?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.676
If I don't bring it back,

00:43.678 --> 00:45.678
I-I don't know what they'll do.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.946
Look, whatever it is
you're looking for,

00:46.948 --> 00:49.081
maybe if you tell us what it is,
we can help you out.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.551
I-I can't.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.620
They'll hurt me if I tell you.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.389
Who's gonna hurt you?

00:56.391 --> 00:58.324
(horn honking)

00:58.326 --> 00:59.925
While we're young!

00:59.927 --> 01:01.227
Touch that horn one more time

01:01.229 --> 01:03.129
and I'm gonna feed you
the steering wheel.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.831
What's your name?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.801
J... Jenny Strong.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.536
But I can't leave.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.738
They're watching me.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.907
Okay, well, look, whatever it is
you're looking for,

01:14.909 --> 01:18.077
it'll probably be easier to find
once traffic dies down, right?

01:18.079 --> 01:19.912
(horn blares)

01:19.914 --> 01:21.147
I-I guess so.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.314
So why don't you
come with us now,

01:22.316 --> 01:24.583
and then you can come back later

01:24.585 --> 01:26.352
and find whatever it is
you're looking for.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.353
What do you say?

01:27.355 --> 01:30.389
(horns honking)

01:33.760 --> 01:36.629
I guess so.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.031
Okay, great.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.570
(drivers cheering)

01:44.572 --> 01:47.239
CAB DRIVER: Yeah, let's get you two
some medals, huh?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.442
Way to go.

01:52.345 --> 01:53.713
We did have a good case, sir,

01:53.715 --> 01:56.649
but Jane Cooley is
a damn good defense attorney--

01:58.051 --> 01:59.251
I get it. No...

01:59.253 --> 02:02.688
Taking down Grazioso is
a priority for this office.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.323
We just...

02:04.325 --> 02:05.524
Hello?

02:07.327 --> 02:09.695
Guess we'll talk
about that later.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.996
You wanted to see me?

02:10.997 --> 02:12.164
Yeah, Jimmy, come on in.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.699
You heard Grazioso
was acquitted

02:13.701 --> 02:15.768
in his racketeering trial?

02:15.770 --> 02:17.470
It's easier to catch
a snake than kill it.

02:17.472 --> 02:19.305
Fortune cookie
wisdom aside,

02:19.307 --> 02:21.006
he runs a major
crime organization

02:21.008 --> 02:22.408
and we need to take him down.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.243
Crazy Lenny's a mob boss, Erin.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.511
He doesn't do
the dirty work anymore.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.379
He gives the orders.
Very, very tough to prove.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.548
Which is why I've been digging
through unsolved crimes

02:29.550 --> 02:31.317
where Grazioso was a suspect.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.220
(laughs) You're gonna need
a pretty big shovel for that.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.254
That's what I thought,

02:35.256 --> 02:38.357
till I saw your name
pop up in a file.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.025
Oh...

02:40.027 --> 02:42.561
Oh, Ronald Green murder.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.963
Hell's Kitchen.

02:43.965 --> 02:46.098
I was just a patrol cop
back then.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.767
ERIN: File says that you
and your partner

02:47.769 --> 02:49.368
were the first ones
on the scene.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.204
Grazioso was questioned,
but never charged.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.773
All true.

02:53.775 --> 02:55.841
Lenny was a soldier
in those days.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.276
Toughest guy on the street.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.378
Lenny warned Green
not to deal on his turf.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.181
Green didn't listen...
end of Green.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.884
But with no witnesses
and no weapon...

03:04.886 --> 03:06.552
Grazioso skated. As usual.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.121
Not to mention when a real
bad guy like Green gets killed,

03:09.123 --> 03:11.924
NYPD doesn't exactly bend over
backwards to make the case.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.894
I'd like to change that ending.

03:14.896 --> 03:16.295
I know it's a long shot,

03:16.297 --> 03:18.264
but I'm gonna reopen
the Green homicide.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.732
I need a lead
investigator

03:19.734 --> 03:22.201
that knows the territory.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.569
Any interest?

Advertise your product or brand here

03:32.012 --> 03:34.246
Sounds like it got
pretty crazy out there.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.148
Standard vehicle fire.
That's our turf.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.751
Unless the fire's the result
of a traffic accident

03:38.753 --> 03:41.420
with casualties--
which it was.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.023
Well, as long you're all okay.

03:44.025 --> 03:46.125
You guys are just pissed
there was no baby to save.

03:46.127 --> 03:48.160
OFFICER 2: Oh, please.
You hose jockeys

03:48.162 --> 03:49.662
are the biggest glory
hounds on the planet.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.030
LINDA:
Okay. Fellas.

03:51.032 --> 03:52.932
Remember,
we're all on the same team.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.300
Right?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.968
Yeah, well, nobody on our team
sleeps on duty.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.003
Yeah? Well, nobody on our team

03:58.005 --> 03:59.371
beats the hell out of
people for no reason.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.906
You're gonna want
to take that back.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.374
Okay, fellas, you know what?
Calm down, okay?

04:02.376 --> 04:03.843
Meter maid.
Hydrant boy!

04:03.845 --> 04:05.778
Ooh!
(grunting)

04:08.114 --> 04:10.149
Come on!
Security!

04:14.187 --> 04:16.154
I need security. Now.

Any civilians

According to our officers,

04:58.547 --> 05:00.347
one of the fireflies
passed a remark

05:00.349 --> 05:01.615
about excessive
use of force.

05:01.617 --> 05:02.583
That'll do it.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.118
It shouldn't.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.721
our guys did their fair share

05:09.592 --> 05:11.392
acting like God's gift.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.459
Hell, they pose

05:12.461 --> 05:14.061
for nudie calendars over there!

05:14.063 --> 05:15.629
Never see any
of our boys doing that.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.097
I think you could
pull it off, Sid.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.198
Damn straight.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.299
On the merits,

05:19.301 --> 05:21.669
FD does a good job for this city.
Sure.

05:21.671 --> 05:23.370
But every time I try
to schedule something

05:23.372 --> 05:25.539
with their commissioner,
all I get is whining.

05:25.541 --> 05:27.408
Equal billing
with the PC,

05:27.410 --> 05:29.576
equidistant to the mayor...
He's jealous

05:29.578 --> 05:30.911
because everybody knows
your name and nobody knows his.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.279
There is no excuse

05:32.281 --> 05:34.882
for a public incident like this.

05:34.884 --> 05:38.385
That said, issue all parties
a command discipline,

05:38.387 --> 05:40.688
minimize the fallout
and let's move on.

05:40.690 --> 05:43.257
It may be too late
for that last part.

05:44.826 --> 05:46.226
The press has it?

05:46.228 --> 05:48.796
It's gonna be on the cover
of the <i>Post</i> tomorrow.

05:48.798 --> 05:50.464
And they're looking for

05:50.466 --> 05:51.465
a comment from you.

05:51.467 --> 05:54.001
Okay.

05:54.003 --> 05:57.404
"The sons of bitches
got their asses kicked."

05:58.473 --> 05:59.873
The mayor's on the line,

05:59.875 --> 06:01.475
with the commissioner of O.E.M.

06:02.944 --> 06:04.144
You need to take it.

06:05.613 --> 06:07.114
I'll call back.

06:17.225 --> 06:18.792
Erin Reagan, Marty Brock.

06:18.794 --> 06:20.894
Marty and I were assigned
a foot post together

06:20.896 --> 06:22.262
the night Ronald Green
got killed.

06:22.264 --> 06:23.897
Well, thanks for
helping us out with this.

06:23.899 --> 06:25.365
Been retired
four years now.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.000
Got to admit,
I've missed the game.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.268
I bet.

06:28.270 --> 06:30.070
Marty and I, we responded
to an alarm at this bodega--

06:30.072 --> 06:31.472
it used to be
a Polish place back then.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.073
I checked the front,

06:33.075 --> 06:34.508
he took the alley.

06:34.510 --> 06:36.477
This way.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.245
BROCK:
I heard sounds of a struggle,

06:38.247 --> 06:40.414
I turned the corner,
heard three shots,

06:40.416 --> 06:42.082
then a body
hits the ground.

06:42.084 --> 06:43.851
You see the shooter?

06:43.853 --> 06:44.818
Heard footsteps

06:44.820 --> 06:46.353
fleeing the scene.

06:46.355 --> 06:48.255
I tried to save Green,
but he was too far gone.

06:48.257 --> 06:50.190
Yeah, I gave chase

06:50.192 --> 06:52.993
while Marty called a bus,
but I came up empty.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.296
Which leaves us
with an unsolved homicide.

06:56.298 --> 06:57.731
Well, maybe not.

06:57.733 --> 06:58.866
According to
the case folder,

06:58.868 --> 07:00.267
the original search covered
a two-block radius.

07:00.269 --> 07:02.436
This morning, me and Jimmy
extended the area search

07:02.438 --> 07:03.837
another two blocks
in the direction

07:03.839 --> 07:05.672
the suspect fled.

07:05.674 --> 07:08.208
And looky what we found.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.610
.38 caliber...

07:09.612 --> 07:11.845
same caliber gun
that killed Ronald Green.

07:12.881 --> 07:14.348
Where'd you find this?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.717
Roof of a single story warehouse
that's been abandoned for years

07:16.719 --> 07:18.018
and wedged under

07:18.020 --> 07:19.319
a pile of asphalt shingles.

07:19.321 --> 07:20.821
Blended right in.

07:20.823 --> 07:22.856
Well, there's no guarantee
that it's the murder weapon.

07:22.858 --> 07:24.191
No, but dreaming big?

07:24.193 --> 07:25.759
If we can link it
to Grazioso,

07:25.761 --> 07:28.662
you could charge him
with murder.

07:37.105 --> 07:39.673
I'll just be a second, okay?

07:40.575 --> 07:42.042
(sighs)

07:42.044 --> 07:43.310
I can't thank
you both enough

07:43.312 --> 07:44.511
for taking care
of Jenny.

07:44.513 --> 07:45.512
Just glad that
we could help.

07:45.514 --> 07:48.182
What exactly
do the doctors say?

07:48.184 --> 07:50.250
She was diagnosed with
schizoaffective disorder

07:50.252 --> 07:51.785
two years ago.

07:51.787 --> 07:53.420
Lately,
she's been getting worse.

07:53.422 --> 07:55.055
Must be tough on you.

07:55.057 --> 07:59.393
We lost Jenny's mom
a couple of years ago,

07:59.395 --> 08:01.595
so it's just been the two of us.

08:01.597 --> 08:03.530
I do the best I can,

08:03.532 --> 08:05.199
I just...

08:05.201 --> 08:06.500
I wish I could do more.

08:06.502 --> 08:07.901
Well, you know, there are
places for people like Jenny...

08:07.903 --> 08:10.237
places where she can get
the help that she needs.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.239
I work for Bridge and Tunnel.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.473
There's no way I could swing

08:13.475 --> 08:15.442
one of those fancy
private hospitals.

08:15.444 --> 08:17.477
There are state institutions.

08:17.479 --> 08:18.946
I visited
a couple.

08:18.948 --> 08:20.581
They're like prison camps.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.883
I'd die before I'd put Jenny
in one of those places.

08:22.885 --> 08:25.886
The city has psychiatric social
workers that you can talk with.

08:25.888 --> 08:28.755
I went to the Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene.

08:28.757 --> 08:30.190
Sat with a caseworker.

08:30.192 --> 08:32.726
She told me there was nothing
she could do.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.964
Tell you what.
Give us the name

08:36.966 --> 08:38.799
of that caseworker
and we'll reach out to her.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.169
I appreciate that.

08:45.874 --> 08:49.543
A 15-year-old homicide?

08:49.545 --> 08:51.511
Please tell me
this is a bad joke.

08:51.513 --> 08:53.313
The joke's on you,
I'm afraid.

08:53.315 --> 08:56.016
Mr. Grazioso,
you knew Ronald Green?

08:56.018 --> 08:58.552
Everyone knew that drug-dealing
sack of crap.

08:58.554 --> 09:00.053
Got what he had coming.

09:00.055 --> 09:01.288
COOLEY:
Though my client

09:01.290 --> 09:02.890
had nothing to do
with his death.

09:02.892 --> 09:05.259
Witnesses say your client
threatened Mr. Green

09:05.261 --> 09:06.560
shortly before his death.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.395
I used to threaten
a lot of people.

09:08.397 --> 09:09.696
I've mellowed with age.

09:09.698 --> 09:12.532
This is a fishing expedition,
Counselor.

09:12.534 --> 09:14.034
And all you're
going to catch

09:14.036 --> 09:16.403
is a lawsuit for harassment

09:16.405 --> 09:18.005
and prosecutorial misconduct.

09:18.007 --> 09:20.440
We'll see about that.

09:20.442 --> 09:21.875
See, we found a gun in
Hell's Kitchen this morning.

09:21.877 --> 09:24.845
Ballistics match the bullets
that killed Ronald Green.

09:24.847 --> 09:26.847
COOLEY: Well, unless
Mr. Grazioso's

09:26.849 --> 09:30.851
prints or DNA are on it,
you have nothing.

09:30.853 --> 09:32.152
You see,
that's where you're wrong.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.721
The gun had been reported stolen

09:34.723 --> 09:36.957
in a home invasion robbery
in Riverdale

09:36.959 --> 09:38.692
about a year before
Green's death.

09:38.694 --> 09:40.327
Are you okay, Lenny?

09:41.329 --> 09:42.963
What the hell is this about?

09:42.965 --> 09:44.398
Two men were convicted
for that home invasion.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.832
One got 14 months,
the other got three months.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.535
You were working the system
even back then, huh?

09:48.537 --> 09:50.370
I didn't pop the little bastard.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.673
Even if my client stole the gun,

09:52.675 --> 09:53.907
that doesn't prove

09:53.909 --> 09:55.175
he had anything to do
with Green's death.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.243
True.

09:56.245 --> 09:57.778
But I think when I introduce

09:57.780 --> 09:59.813
Lenny's connection to that gun

09:59.815 --> 10:01.415
and add in his mortal threats

10:01.417 --> 10:03.250
against the victim,
maybe toss in

10:03.252 --> 10:04.818
his reputation for violence?
(clicks tongue)

10:04.820 --> 10:06.987
I think the jury's
gonna eat that up.

10:08.056 --> 10:09.723
I'll see you in court.

10:11.459 --> 10:12.659
Oh, and Lenny?

10:13.728 --> 10:15.162
Wear that blue suit.

10:15.164 --> 10:17.331
I like that one.

10:24.739 --> 10:28.108
I met with Jenny Strong
and her father.

10:28.110 --> 10:31.244
There's no question
she belongs in a care facility.

10:31.246 --> 10:34.014
Joseph Strong said he's unable
to afford a private hospital.

10:34.016 --> 10:35.349
Most people can't.

10:35.351 --> 10:37.951
That's why God created
the state hospital system.

10:37.953 --> 10:41.254
Well, apparently,
God didn't do a very good job.

10:41.256 --> 10:44.424
Joseph Strong's afraid to put
Jenny in a place like that.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.426
That's his right.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.662
And his choice.

10:48.664 --> 10:50.831
Now, is there anything else
I can do for you?

10:50.833 --> 10:53.200
"Anything else"?

10:53.202 --> 10:55.535
I'm sorry, you're implying
that you've done something?

10:55.537 --> 10:57.571
I have-- my job.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.772
Now, if you'll excuse me.

10:58.774 --> 11:02.075
Look, we understand
you're really busy.

11:02.077 --> 11:04.945
We just want to know if there's
another option for Jenny Strong.

11:06.147 --> 11:07.981
(sighs)

11:09.350 --> 11:11.318
I recommended a home health aid,

11:11.320 --> 11:14.287
and Mr. Strong indicated
he can't afford that.

11:14.289 --> 11:17.257
And, unfortunately, he has
no relatives in the area

11:17.259 --> 11:19.326
who can help with
his daughter's care.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.361
Well, what's the guy
supposed to do?

11:21.363 --> 11:23.063
Let me break it down for you.

11:23.065 --> 11:25.832
Resources for this agency
are completely inadequate.

11:25.834 --> 11:29.236
And when the budget ax falls,
it hits here first.

11:29.238 --> 11:31.571
We do the best we can
with what we've got.

11:31.573 --> 11:33.073
All due respect,

11:33.075 --> 11:34.741
it sounds like you're just
kind of throwing your hands up.

11:34.743 --> 11:36.910
Look who's talking.

11:36.912 --> 11:38.612
Excuse me?

11:38.614 --> 11:39.579
What's that supposed to mean?

11:39.581 --> 11:41.515
The city employees

11:41.517 --> 11:43.917
these poor folks come
into contact with the most--

11:43.919 --> 11:45.252
NYPD.

11:45.254 --> 11:47.387
That's nothing
we wanted.

11:47.389 --> 11:49.356
Well, you got it.

11:49.358 --> 11:51.591
And, frankly,
you're doing a lousy job.

11:51.593 --> 11:54.227
You're barely trained to deal
with the mentally ill,

11:54.229 --> 11:55.695
and yet you're often
the first responders.

11:55.697 --> 11:59.132
So before you barge
in here, pointing fingers,

11:59.134 --> 12:01.334
take a look in the mirror first.

12:01.336 --> 12:03.837
Appreciate your help.

12:26.594 --> 12:28.795
Thanks for
meeting me, Stan.

12:28.797 --> 12:29.830
It's not exactly voluntary.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.231
The mayor wants us
to bury the hatchet.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.899
I'm not here 'cause
the mayor told me to be.

12:32.901 --> 12:33.867
You?

12:33.869 --> 12:35.202
Have it your way.

12:35.204 --> 12:37.204
We're here because
we miss each other so much.

12:37.206 --> 12:38.271
You want to show
some respect?

12:38.273 --> 12:40.040
Sid.

12:41.075 --> 12:43.810
What happened in that
E.R. is bad for everyone.

12:43.812 --> 12:45.245
Yours and mine.

12:45.247 --> 12:47.080
FDNY had the call
under control,

12:47.082 --> 12:50.817
when ESU marched in
and started barking orders.

12:50.819 --> 12:52.519
According to the incident
command directive,

12:52.521 --> 12:55.322
my officers were well
within their authority.

12:55.324 --> 12:56.590
Agree to disagree.

12:56.592 --> 12:58.258
The incident report has
one of your guys

12:58.260 --> 12:59.292
throwing the first punch.

12:59.294 --> 13:01.328
NYPD incident report?

13:01.330 --> 13:03.163
Nurse on duty confirms it.

13:03.165 --> 13:04.431
Yeah.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.633
Yeah, and she has
a very familiar last name.

13:09.403 --> 13:12.439
I talked to the DA,
no charges will be brought.

13:12.441 --> 13:14.674
Yeah, 'cause your guys
would get charged too.

13:14.676 --> 13:16.209
Is this going somewhere?

13:16.211 --> 13:17.844
Not if you keep
putting up roadblocks.

13:17.846 --> 13:21.915
Every day, your people step
all over FDNY jobs,

13:21.917 --> 13:23.517
and you want what?

13:23.519 --> 13:25.318
A note of thanks,
a box of chocolates?

13:25.320 --> 13:26.820
This is way above
my pay grade.

13:26.822 --> 13:27.954
STAN: Oh, you
got that right.

13:27.956 --> 13:30.123
You're not everybody's
boss, Frank.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.825
You got a problem,
talk to O.E.M.

13:31.827 --> 13:33.560
STAN: Oh, yeah, and they may
as well be on your payroll.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.263
And we both know the mayor
always sides with the PD.

13:36.265 --> 13:38.698
Or maybe just his commissioner.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.367
Ah...

13:40.369 --> 13:41.668
There he is.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.303
The real Frank Reagan
just showed up.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.605
Our people need to cooperate.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.541
By which you mean-- the guys
with the guns run the show.

13:47.543 --> 13:51.845
It is our job to protect
everyone, including your men.

13:51.847 --> 13:53.947
My men can take care
of themselves.

13:53.949 --> 13:55.715
The mayor suggested
a joint photo op

13:55.717 --> 13:56.950
to show that there's no rift

13:56.952 --> 13:58.518
between the cops
and the fire fighters.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.021
Why don't we
step outside?

14:03.758 --> 14:05.392
Pass.

14:05.394 --> 14:07.394
You're passing on your picture
in the papers?

14:07.396 --> 14:08.862
That'd be a first.

14:10.031 --> 14:11.531
Good day, Frank.

14:13.701 --> 14:15.869
Good talk, Stan.

14:31.851 --> 14:33.118
Counselor.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.421
I came to discuss
the Ronald Green case.

14:36.423 --> 14:38.823
If you're shopping for a deal,
it's not gonna happen.

14:38.825 --> 14:40.392
We're not looking to cop a plea.

14:40.394 --> 14:42.260
Okay, so why are you here?

14:42.262 --> 14:45.363
Mr. Grazioso didn't kill
Ronald Green.

14:45.365 --> 14:47.599
Well, we'll have a nice long
trial to prove just that.

14:47.601 --> 14:50.635
Actually, I don't think
it will take very long.

14:50.637 --> 14:53.371
I do like your confidence.

14:53.373 --> 14:55.006
I have an alibi witness
who will swear

14:55.008 --> 14:57.409
that my client was in his
apartment ten blocks away

14:57.411 --> 14:58.643
when Mr. Green was murdered.

14:58.645 --> 15:00.045
And let me guess.

15:00.047 --> 15:01.846
It's one of your client's
mob associates?

15:01.848 --> 15:04.983
As a matter of fact, yes.

15:04.985 --> 15:06.251
And you're gonna hang
your entire defense

15:06.253 --> 15:07.585
on the credibility
of a gangster?

15:07.587 --> 15:10.321
Well, not just any gangster.

15:10.323 --> 15:11.689
Sorry, I was in the can.

15:12.925 --> 15:14.859
Airline food.

15:14.861 --> 15:16.027
Vincent.

15:16.029 --> 15:19.164
How you doing, kiddo?

15:24.136 --> 15:26.204
She could take some
responsibility.

15:26.206 --> 15:29.140
Instead, she's blaming the
NYPD for doing a lousy job

15:29.142 --> 15:31.242
with the mentally ill,
which is her job.

15:31.244 --> 15:32.644
It's not our job.

15:32.646 --> 15:35.180
Hey, she's right on that--
it's our job too.

15:35.182 --> 15:36.848
We don't have the
training or the resources

15:36.850 --> 15:38.349
to deal with EDPs.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.684
They don't have the
resources either,

15:39.686 --> 15:42.487
and passing the buck back
and forth doesn't help.

15:42.489 --> 15:44.189
So now we're supposed
to be shrinks too?

15:44.191 --> 15:46.224
Comes with the
territory, I guess.

15:46.226 --> 15:47.492
Jamie, do you...

15:47.494 --> 15:49.461
do you remember that
rookie from the 2-9

15:49.463 --> 15:51.696
who shot an EDP who
went for his gun?

15:51.698 --> 15:53.898
The papers found
out about that,

15:53.900 --> 15:55.834
and it cost the city
a million bucks,

15:55.836 --> 15:57.902
not to mention the cop
a lot of heartache.

15:57.904 --> 15:59.204
Yeah, I didn't say
it was fair.

15:59.206 --> 16:01.406
But for better or worse, we're
the ones on the front lines.

16:01.408 --> 16:04.742
I met Jenny Strong,
I've seen her situation.

16:04.744 --> 16:06.845
Now how am I gonna unsee it?

16:13.352 --> 16:15.120
What the hell are you
doing here, Vincent?

16:15.122 --> 16:17.589
What, you're not
happy to see me?

16:18.924 --> 16:21.559
Look, Erin,

16:21.561 --> 16:24.062
I had no idea
you were the prosecutor.

16:24.064 --> 16:27.832
I heard through the grapevine
the DA was going after Lenny

16:27.834 --> 16:29.501
for popping Ronny Green.

16:29.503 --> 16:33.104
I had no idea the mob grapevine
extended to rural Iowa.

16:33.106 --> 16:36.074
I keep in touch
with the old gang, okay?

16:36.076 --> 16:38.443
Let me tell you
about witness protection.

16:38.445 --> 16:39.544
It's boring as hell.

16:39.546 --> 16:41.079
Sometimes I think
I'm going out of my mind.

16:41.081 --> 16:44.749
It still doesn't explain
why you're here.

16:44.751 --> 16:46.784
The boss needs an alibi.

16:46.786 --> 16:48.319
You're looking at him.

16:48.321 --> 16:51.289
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wasn't it Grazioso

16:51.291 --> 16:52.590
who put a price on your head

16:52.592 --> 16:54.359
for turning informant
in the first place?

16:54.361 --> 16:55.493
That would be correct.

16:55.495 --> 16:56.861
So he punched
your ticket to Iowa,

16:56.863 --> 16:58.296
and now you're gonna
vouch for him?

16:58.298 --> 17:01.166
Ironic, eh?

17:01.168 --> 17:02.500
Vincent, I read
your proffer to the feds

17:02.502 --> 17:03.768
before you entered WITSEC.

17:03.770 --> 17:05.270
You were required
to list every crime

17:05.271 --> 17:07.438
of which you
had knowledge,

17:07.440 --> 17:09.307
and never once did you
mention the Green case.

17:09.309 --> 17:11.242
Must have slipped my mind.

17:11.243 --> 17:14.579
My point being
is if you testify

17:14.580 --> 17:16.647
and it comes out that
you had any knowledge

17:16.650 --> 17:19.917
of this case beyond
Grazioso's whereabouts,

17:19.920 --> 17:21.653
you could be kicked
out of WITSEC.

17:21.655 --> 17:23.154
You would be on your own and...

17:25.057 --> 17:26.657
And you don't care,

17:26.660 --> 17:29.727
because you have no intention
of returning to WITSEC,

17:29.729 --> 17:30.995
do you, Vincent?

17:30.997 --> 17:33.464
You're getting warmer.

17:33.466 --> 17:36.968
You cut a deal with Grazioso.

17:38.237 --> 17:42.006
Your testimony
for the price off your head.

17:42.008 --> 17:44.976
That's what I love about you.

17:46.312 --> 17:49.948
You're beautiful...
and you're smart.

17:55.521 --> 17:56.921
Drop the knife!

17:56.923 --> 17:58.656
Don't shoot, please!

17:58.658 --> 18:00.625
Do as I say!

18:00.627 --> 18:02.760
Drop the knife.
Sir, just stay back.

18:02.762 --> 18:04.462
Please, don't hurt her--
please, she doesn't know

18:04.464 --> 18:05.997
what she's doing, Please!
Hey, hey, what's going on?

18:05.999 --> 18:08.399
Domestic disturbance,
she stabbed her father.

18:08.401 --> 18:10.902
You don't understand--
they're coming for me.

18:10.904 --> 18:12.303
Uh, hey, hey, don't shoot, okay?

18:12.305 --> 18:13.638
We know this girl, we know her.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.106
Then tell her to
put the knife down.

18:15.108 --> 18:16.574
She's an EDP.

18:16.576 --> 18:19.143
I don't care if she's freaking
E.T., she needs to put it down.

18:19.145 --> 18:21.112
Hey, just give me a minute
to talk to her, all right?

18:21.114 --> 18:22.347
Just give me
a minute.

18:24.984 --> 18:26.050
Jamie.

18:26.052 --> 18:26.985
Uh, I'll be careful.

18:26.987 --> 18:28.219
Be careful.

18:28.221 --> 18:29.787
All right, all
right, all right.

18:29.789 --> 18:30.788
Jenny, hey.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.290
Do you remember me,
Officer Reagan?

18:32.292 --> 18:34.926
I didn't mean to hurt Daddy.

18:34.928 --> 18:37.161
They said he was gonna kill me.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.663
I'm okay, baby,
I'm okay.

18:38.665 --> 18:39.864
That's right,
he's okay.

18:40.899 --> 18:43.234
I just need you to relax
and put down the knife.

18:43.236 --> 18:45.870
I can't do that, they're
probably watching me right now.

18:45.872 --> 18:48.606
No one's watching you,
Jenny, I promise.

18:48.608 --> 18:51.576
Look, Jenny, I know
things are bad right now,

18:51.578 --> 18:54.512
but you're scared.

18:54.514 --> 18:57.749
But if you trust me...
if you'd just trust me,

18:57.751 --> 18:59.651
I promise things
will get better.

19:00.953 --> 19:05.023
Would you put down
the knife, please?

19:19.305 --> 19:22.240
(sobbing):
I'm really sorry.

19:30.616 --> 19:31.549
It's okay.

19:31.551 --> 19:32.750
Okay?

19:34.586 --> 19:36.721
It's okay.

19:39.158 --> 19:42.160
So the smoke-eaters land
at the crime scene,

19:42.162 --> 19:43.494
ignore an order
to stand down,

19:43.496 --> 19:45.263
and now I got
a wounded officer.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.365
That's about it.

19:49.668 --> 19:51.569
FRANK:
As you were.

19:56.175 --> 19:57.675
FRANK:
Officer Redlich.

19:57.677 --> 19:59.377
Commissioner Reagan.

20:01.013 --> 20:02.313
How's the leg?

20:02.315 --> 20:03.648
(sighs)

20:03.650 --> 20:05.083
It's a lot better,
sir, thank you.

20:05.085 --> 20:06.617
I want you to tell
the commissioner

20:06.619 --> 20:08.019
how you got shot, Derek.

20:08.021 --> 20:10.121
And this is not
an investigation.

20:10.123 --> 20:11.622
We're on the
same side here.

20:12.725 --> 20:16.427
We were, uh, working
with the narcotics task force,

20:16.429 --> 20:18.763
getting ready to hit
this drug den off 110th.

20:18.765 --> 20:21.799
And suspects got wind
we were coming.

20:21.801 --> 20:23.534
Go on.

20:23.536 --> 20:26.037
They set the place on fire.

20:26.039 --> 20:28.106
Probably trying to
destroy evidence.

20:28.108 --> 20:30.341
Boss decided we'd collar
the suspects

20:30.343 --> 20:31.743
as they fled
the burning building.

20:31.745 --> 20:33.478
To avoid a fire fight.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.446
Makes sense.

20:35.448 --> 20:37.081
Next thing we know,
FD's on the scene.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.484
Boss briefed the fire captain,
told him it's a crime scene

20:39.486 --> 20:41.152
with armed
suspects inside.

20:41.154 --> 20:44.021
He ordered the FD not to
approach the building.

20:44.023 --> 20:46.591
But they engaged
the fire anyway.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.359
REDLICH: Suspects started shooting,
we were force to return fire,

20:48.361 --> 20:49.761
and all hell broke loose.

20:49.763 --> 20:51.295
That's when I got hit.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.470
Thank you, Derek.

20:59.472 --> 21:00.838
Good work today.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.373
Thank you, sir.

21:05.944 --> 21:08.579
Those sons of bitches
need to pay for this.

21:08.581 --> 21:10.047
Somebody does.

21:10.049 --> 21:11.115
Interfering with
police business,

21:11.117 --> 21:12.216
endangering an officer.

21:12.218 --> 21:13.451
Say the word, I'll collar

21:13.453 --> 21:15.153
every joker in
that engine company!

21:15.155 --> 21:16.421
Not gonna happen.

21:16.423 --> 21:17.722
Why the hell not?

21:17.724 --> 21:20.324
Because they were following
orders from the top.

21:20.326 --> 21:21.659
Commissioner Rourke?

21:21.661 --> 21:23.561
That was a shot across the bow.

21:23.563 --> 21:25.763
Mine.

21:31.503 --> 21:35.072
Beautiful night, huh?

21:35.074 --> 21:39.010
Shouldn't you be out celebrating
with your mob buddies?

21:39.012 --> 21:42.313
Erin, I wanted to tell you

21:42.315 --> 21:44.382
that I-I feel bad
about what happened.

21:44.384 --> 21:46.317
It wasn't personal.

21:46.319 --> 21:48.419
What about all that stuff
you fed me in Iowa

21:48.421 --> 21:49.821
about changing your life?

21:49.823 --> 21:52.390
About making
your granddaughter proud?

21:52.392 --> 21:53.758
That was all true.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.959
Give me a break.

21:54.961 --> 21:58.429
You saw a chance to buy
your freedom and you took it.

21:58.431 --> 22:02.333
Guilty as charged,
except for one minor detail.

22:02.335 --> 22:03.568
Crazy Lenny

22:03.570 --> 22:05.236
did not kill Ronald Green.

22:05.238 --> 22:06.337
You know what?

22:06.339 --> 22:08.372
You want to keep telling
yourself that-- fine.

22:08.374 --> 22:10.041
But don't lie to me.

22:10.043 --> 22:12.510
I got no reason to.

22:12.512 --> 22:14.045
The fact of the matter is

22:14.047 --> 22:17.148
I was with Grazioso
in his apartment

22:17.150 --> 22:18.349
the night that

22:18.351 --> 22:20.718
that dirt bag Green got whacked.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.354
And I was smoking a Cuban cigar
just like this one.

22:23.356 --> 22:26.557
You went after
the wrong guy, kiddo.

22:26.559 --> 22:29.293
Okay, so if Grazioso
didn't do it,

22:29.295 --> 22:31.195
who killed Ronald Green?

22:31.197 --> 22:33.331
Erin, Erin,
that was a long time ago.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.399
Come on, let it go.

22:35.401 --> 22:37.201
Tell me.

22:37.203 --> 22:39.971
Okay.

22:39.973 --> 22:42.039
Back in Hell's Kitchen,

22:42.041 --> 22:44.075
when we were coming up,

22:44.077 --> 22:46.677
the cops and the wise guys,

22:46.679 --> 22:49.313
we had an understanding.

22:49.315 --> 22:52.016
So, you're telling me
the cops knew who killed Green

22:52.018 --> 22:54.352
and they just
turned their backs?

22:54.354 --> 22:55.953
No.

22:55.955 --> 22:57.455
I'm telling you

22:57.457 --> 23:00.658
that the guy who killed Green

23:00.660 --> 23:03.794
was wearing a badge.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.348
Beef stew's
delicious, Erin.

23:20.349 --> 23:21.855
Got the recipe online.

23:21.856 --> 23:23.922
From a new firehouse cookbook.

23:24.924 --> 23:26.392
Very funny.

23:26.394 --> 23:27.626
(laughter)

23:27.628 --> 23:29.361
I just lost my appetite.

23:30.807 --> 23:33.859
FDNY isn't at the top
of my list right now, boys.

23:34.257 --> 23:36.991
Okay, guys, no matter
what you think of them,

23:36.993 --> 23:38.526
firemen are great cooks.

23:38.528 --> 23:39.894
Oh, please.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.496
That's 'cause they
sit around all day

23:41.498 --> 23:42.864
swapping recipes.

23:42.866 --> 23:44.332
(laughs)

23:44.334 --> 23:46.034
Yeah, using the uniform
to pick up girls.

23:46.036 --> 23:47.168
Exactly.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.103
But, uh, isn't that
how you met Mom?

23:49.105 --> 23:51.339
Eat your food.
Ooh...

23:51.341 --> 23:52.974
Let's face it--
firemen are hot.

23:52.976 --> 23:54.342
Right, Mom?

23:54.344 --> 23:57.745
I decline to answer on the basis
it might incriminate me.

23:57.747 --> 23:59.914
Yeah, what she said.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.182
NICKY:
Mm-hmm.

24:01.184 --> 24:03.017
Cowards.

24:03.019 --> 24:04.886
Isn't it weird that cops and
fireman hate each other so much?

24:04.888 --> 24:06.788
That's because they're
smoke-eating pretty boys.

24:06.790 --> 24:08.189
Right, Pops?

24:09.358 --> 24:10.658
Did I say that?

24:10.660 --> 24:12.060
We don't exactly
hate each other, Jack.

24:12.062 --> 24:15.029
It's just that
sometimes we disagree.

24:15.031 --> 24:17.065
Strenuously.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.433
Like the brawl at the
Bravest-Finest hockey game

24:18.435 --> 24:20.168
last year at the Coliseum.

24:20.170 --> 24:21.469
Mm.

24:21.471 --> 24:23.104
We kicked their butts
all over the ice.

24:23.106 --> 24:24.339
Lovely.

24:24.341 --> 24:25.373
That's right.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.974
And we smoked those bums 8-5.

24:26.976 --> 24:29.510
Sometimes people
who are supposed to get along

24:29.512 --> 24:31.179
And end up fighting instead, Jack.

24:31.181 --> 24:33.314
Unfortunately, that's
when people can get hurt.

24:33.316 --> 24:34.882
We still talking about firemen?

24:34.884 --> 24:36.250
Eddie and I have been dealing

24:36.252 --> 24:38.386
with a mentally ill woman
the last few days.

24:38.388 --> 24:40.355
She needs help.
In-between us

24:40.357 --> 24:43.157
and DHMH,
she's not getting it.

24:43.159 --> 24:46.127
There's a ton of people like
that living up near school.

24:46.129 --> 24:47.662
It's really sad.

24:47.664 --> 24:50.765
Dealing with that population
has always been a crapshoot.

24:50.767 --> 24:52.467
It shouldn't be.

24:52.469 --> 24:53.801
They come into
the hospital every day.

24:53.803 --> 24:55.536
We treat them.
We put them back on the street.

24:55.538 --> 24:56.771
Doesn't solve the problem.

24:56.773 --> 24:58.139
They're all over court, too.

24:58.141 --> 24:59.540
Most of them don't belong.

24:59.542 --> 25:01.075
Can't save everyone.

25:01.077 --> 25:03.711
We can try.

25:15.491 --> 25:17.091
You got a minute?

25:17.093 --> 25:19.894
I'm all ears.

25:21.830 --> 25:24.432
As long as it's not about FDNY.

25:24.434 --> 25:26.334
Oh, this will hit
closer to home.

25:26.336 --> 25:29.504
You know my office is
pursuing Lenny Grazioso?

25:29.506 --> 25:31.372
With limited success.

25:31.374 --> 25:32.707
To say the least.

25:32.709 --> 25:34.709
So I dug up an
unsolved murder

25:34.711 --> 25:37.245
of a drug dealer
from 15 years ago.

25:37.247 --> 25:38.880
Donald Green.

25:38.882 --> 25:40.515
When a weapon

25:40.517 --> 25:43.885
is found on a cold homicide,
it hits my radar.

25:43.887 --> 25:47.288
Well, I was hoping to use
that weapon to nail Grazioso,

25:47.290 --> 25:49.991
but he has an alibi.

25:49.993 --> 25:52.126
That's not the end of the story.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.963
I have information

25:55.965 --> 25:59.267
that Ronald Green was
killed by a police officer.

26:00.302 --> 26:03.304
(sighs)

26:03.306 --> 26:06.741
How credible's the source?

26:06.743 --> 26:09.143
We've put some really bad guys
away based on his testimony.

26:09.145 --> 26:11.646
Cop committing murder's rare.

26:11.648 --> 26:14.682
But you already know that,
so what are you really asking?

26:16.985 --> 26:20.388
Ronald Green was a really
bad guy, who got killed.

26:20.390 --> 26:24.425
With Grazioso cleared, I have
no reason to pursue this case.

26:24.427 --> 26:26.561
But if I pursue it,

26:26.563 --> 26:28.830
and my source turns
out to be right...

26:28.832 --> 26:31.599
You've be solving a cold case.

26:31.601 --> 26:33.634
A murder case.

26:33.636 --> 26:35.870
With a cop as the perp.

26:37.005 --> 26:40.274
Show me where it says
we get to pick and choose.

26:53.055 --> 26:55.857
Hey, whole precinct's talking

26:55.859 --> 26:58.493
about how talked that knife
out of Jenny Strong's hand.

26:58.495 --> 27:01.028
It wasn't that big a deal.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.097
You saved her life, Jamie.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.399
Ah, maybe, but she's
still in a lot of trouble.

27:05.401 --> 27:06.601
Oh, I keep thinking
of those guys

27:06.603 --> 27:07.702
that were first on the scene.

27:07.704 --> 27:09.370
They were in a
really tough spot.

27:09.372 --> 27:11.873
Yeah, and they showed
proper restraint.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.674
I don't know,
if it had been me,

27:13.676 --> 27:15.810
I might've shot her.

27:15.812 --> 27:18.746
I don't believe that.

27:18.748 --> 27:22.016
Trust me, if she came
after you with that knife,

27:22.018 --> 27:23.384
I'd have taken her out.

27:23.386 --> 27:25.152
Jenny Strong isn't responsible
for her actions, Eddie.

27:25.154 --> 27:26.521
She's sick.

27:26.523 --> 27:28.789
Listen, you put your life
on the line, Jamie,

27:28.791 --> 27:30.958
and maybe that was heroic.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.193
But it was also very reckless.

27:32.195 --> 27:33.628
And you could've died.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.596
So who's gonna protect her?
So what,

27:35.598 --> 27:37.365
are you gonna babysit her 24/7?

27:37.367 --> 27:38.599
I won't have to.

27:38.601 --> 27:40.368
A guy that I went
to school with is now

27:40.370 --> 27:43.871
chief counsel at the Willow
Lanes Institute in Westchester.

27:43.873 --> 27:45.740
Willow Lanes Institute,
Westchester?

27:45.742 --> 27:47.942
That doesn't sound
like big bucks to you?

27:47.944 --> 27:49.377
Bucks the Strongs don't have?

27:49.379 --> 27:51.245
They have
a small number of beds

27:51.247 --> 27:53.014
for needy patients--
my pal was able

27:53.016 --> 27:55.850
to pull a few strings
and got her a bed.

27:57.119 --> 27:58.553
That's <i>huge.</i>

27:58.555 --> 28:01.489
Yeah, well, it's a
chance anyway, so...

28:01.491 --> 28:03.858
I don't care what
everyone says, Reagan,

28:03.860 --> 28:05.993
you're all right.

28:05.995 --> 28:08.195
See you at roll call.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.300
ERIN:
<i>Thanks for meeting me.</i>

28:13.969 --> 28:15.970
You know I love you, Erin,

28:15.972 --> 28:19.307
but... I just got
straight with Grazioso,

28:19.309 --> 28:22.610
and the last thing I need
is to be seen palling around

28:22.612 --> 28:24.178
with the D.A.'s office.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.014
I need to know
who killed Ronald Green.

28:27.016 --> 28:28.082
That again?

28:28.084 --> 28:29.617
That piece of garbage

28:29.619 --> 28:31.652
is dead and buried.

28:31.654 --> 28:33.821
Leave him there.
I can't.

28:33.823 --> 28:36.123
You said a cop
pulled the trigger.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.525
I need a name.

28:37.527 --> 28:41.028
I'm done making cases
for you guys, okay?

28:41.030 --> 28:42.930
I just got my life back.

28:42.932 --> 28:46.100
And I want to spend
the rest of it,

28:46.102 --> 28:48.402
one, taking care
of my granddaughter;

28:48.404 --> 28:50.738
two, eating a lot of pasta;

28:50.740 --> 28:52.707
and three, probably
losing my ass

28:52.709 --> 28:55.076
at the track-- that's it.

28:56.078 --> 28:58.512
Please.

28:58.514 --> 29:00.581
(sighs)

29:00.583 --> 29:02.650
You're-you're stubborn.

29:02.652 --> 29:04.685
All right, listen to me.

29:04.687 --> 29:07.188
Not everyone
that grows up

29:07.190 --> 29:09.824
in Hell's Kitchen
becomes a gangster.

29:09.826 --> 29:11.158
Some...

29:11.160 --> 29:13.227
become cops.

29:14.363 --> 29:16.197
You want answers?

29:16.199 --> 29:18.332
Start there.

29:19.901 --> 29:21.902
ERIN:
<i>You told me yourself</i>

29:21.904 --> 29:24.308
you used to run errands
for Lenny Grazioso.

29:24.407 --> 29:26.807
Yeah, when I was ten years old
I picked up

29:26.809 --> 29:28.376
his damn cigars for him--
so what?

29:28.378 --> 29:29.744
So I'm the prosecutor
on this case,

29:29.746 --> 29:31.078
and I've got to ask
these questions,

29:31.080 --> 29:32.631
and you would do
the same thing, am I right?

29:32.655 --> 29:33.749
What do you got?

29:33.750 --> 29:35.016
I've got credible information

29:35.018 --> 29:37.351
that Ronald Green
was killed by a cop.

29:37.353 --> 29:38.386
From who?

29:38.388 --> 29:39.687
Vincent Rella.

29:39.689 --> 29:40.688
Well, that's a fresh definition

29:40.690 --> 29:41.856
of "credible."
Well, you know,

29:41.858 --> 29:42.923
he's never lied to me,

29:42.925 --> 29:44.859
and I can count those people
on one hand.

29:44.861 --> 29:46.027
Am I one of them?

29:46.029 --> 29:47.962
I certainly hope so.

29:47.964 --> 29:49.263
Gee, thanks for that.

29:49.265 --> 29:52.533
You were there, Jimmy.

29:53.368 --> 29:55.002
Look...

29:55.004 --> 29:56.570
if I whacked
Ronald Green,

29:56.572 --> 29:59.407
why the hell would I agree
to reopen the case for you?

29:59.409 --> 30:01.609
I don't know. You tell me.
When I ran

30:01.611 --> 30:03.711
into that alley,
Green had already been shot.

30:03.713 --> 30:05.079
Marty was working on him

30:05.081 --> 30:06.447
to try to keep
him alive.

30:06.449 --> 30:08.616
And I...

30:11.520 --> 30:12.653
Hey, no way.

30:12.655 --> 30:15.456
No way. Marty Brock
was a good cop.

30:15.458 --> 30:16.857
Does he know Grazioso?

30:16.859 --> 30:19.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
everyone knew Lenny.

30:19.262 --> 30:20.461
What about Ronald Green?

30:20.463 --> 30:21.462
Green was Marty's guy.

30:21.464 --> 30:23.097
We used him as a snitch
sometimes.

30:23.099 --> 30:25.599
Any chance that relationship
went south?

30:25.601 --> 30:27.868
Well, I think
I would've known, yeah.

30:27.870 --> 30:30.404
But you don't,
in fact, know, right?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.642
Who found the weapon
on the roof, you or Marty?

30:35.510 --> 30:37.178
He did.

30:39.047 --> 30:42.149
I think we need to talk
to your ex-partner.

30:51.526 --> 30:53.427
Good night.

30:53.429 --> 30:55.663
Mr. Strong,
thanks for coming in.

30:55.665 --> 30:57.231
I wanted to talk to you
about Jenny.

30:57.233 --> 30:59.100
I appreciate everything you
did for her, Officer Reagan.

30:59.102 --> 31:00.668
Look, I made a couple of calls

31:00.670 --> 31:03.337
and I was able to get her a bed
at Willow Lanes.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.773
It's a great hospital.
Officer Reagan...

31:06.608 --> 31:08.642
What?

31:09.511 --> 31:11.812
Jenny's dead.

31:11.814 --> 31:13.681
She, uh...

31:13.683 --> 31:15.683
(trembling breath)

31:15.685 --> 31:19.220
She hung herself last night.

31:19.222 --> 31:22.823
♪ ♪

31:38.061 --> 31:40.496
So now you're saying I was in
the drug business with Green?

31:40.497 --> 31:41.763
Screw you, Jimmy!

31:41.765 --> 31:44.252
That alley is
a known drug location.

31:44.352 --> 31:45.752
Maybe you stumbled on Green

31:45.754 --> 31:47.353
dealing behind
your back...

31:47.355 --> 31:48.755
you didn't like it,
so you killed him.

31:48.757 --> 31:50.123
With a second gun

31:50.125 --> 31:51.557
I just happen to be carrying?

31:51.559 --> 31:53.960
We both carried a second piece
back then, Marty.

31:53.962 --> 31:55.495
And according
to the lab results,

31:55.497 --> 31:57.830
that gun lacks wear and tear
consistent with a weapon

31:57.832 --> 32:00.800
that sat outside on a roof
for the last 15 years.

32:02.536 --> 32:03.703
So let me get this straight.

32:03.705 --> 32:05.538
Somehow,
I get my hands

32:05.540 --> 32:07.240
on this piece Grazioso stole,

32:07.242 --> 32:09.876
use it to pop Green,

32:09.878 --> 32:12.111
then hang onto it for 15 years

32:12.113 --> 32:13.579
JIMMY:
After Grazioso

32:13.581 --> 32:14.881
got busted for that robbery,

32:14.883 --> 32:16.783
the weapon disappeared
from the evidence room.

32:16.785 --> 32:18.318
So?

32:18.320 --> 32:20.753
So a gun linked
to a known mob figure

32:20.755 --> 32:22.422
is the perfect murder weapon.

32:22.424 --> 32:25.491
You shot Green,
then you held onto the gun

32:25.493 --> 32:27.527
just in case somebody took
a second look at his death.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.028
Man...

32:29.030 --> 32:31.097
you guys are really desperate.

32:31.099 --> 32:32.532
You can't nail Grazioso,

32:32.534 --> 32:34.834
so you come after me?

32:34.836 --> 32:35.868
Come on, Marty.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.903
If you did this...

32:36.905 --> 32:38.137
Are-are you kidding me?

32:38.139 --> 32:40.306
You saw the shooter
flee the scene!

32:40.308 --> 32:41.307
You chased him!

32:41.309 --> 32:42.308
Unless it wasn't the shooter,

32:42.310 --> 32:43.676
but the individual

32:43.678 --> 32:44.844
Green was selling to...

32:44.846 --> 32:46.245
who witnessed the murder.

32:51.185 --> 32:53.886
You got any more questions,
call my lawyer.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.054
I'm done.

32:58.192 --> 32:59.726
And you and me...

32:59.728 --> 33:02.562
we're done, too.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.782
You're like
a recurring nightmare.

33:22.784 --> 33:25.551
I know that Marty Brock
killed Ronald Green.

33:25.553 --> 33:26.552
Great.

33:26.554 --> 33:27.520
Go arrest the schmuck,

33:27.522 --> 33:29.322
but please,
leave me out of this.

33:29.324 --> 33:30.723
I can't do that.

33:30.725 --> 33:32.558
<i>Maron...</i>

33:32.560 --> 33:34.460
And here we go again.

33:37.031 --> 33:40.033
I had the same problem
that I had with Grazioso.

33:40.035 --> 33:41.701
Yeah.

33:41.703 --> 33:43.970
You got no damn case.

33:43.972 --> 33:45.772
There was a witness
there that night,

33:45.774 --> 33:47.273
someone who saw
Brock kill Green.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.144
Look, way back, I heard
that Brock took out Green

33:51.146 --> 33:53.746
because he was holding back on
his cut of the drug business.

33:53.748 --> 33:55.515
So they were working together.

33:55.517 --> 33:56.682
Yeah.

33:56.684 --> 33:57.817
He had police protection.

33:57.819 --> 33:58.751
Don't you understand?

33:58.753 --> 34:00.953
That's why he
had the balls

34:00.955 --> 34:03.189
to deal on Grazioso's turf.

34:03.191 --> 34:06.092
Until the garbanzo decided
to hold back on Brock.

34:06.094 --> 34:07.760
Bad career move.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.030
I need to find that witness,
Vincent.

34:11.032 --> 34:14.000
Erin, I don't have a name.

34:14.002 --> 34:16.202
If I had one, you know
I'd give it to you.

34:16.204 --> 34:19.371
I never heard about any witness.

34:23.444 --> 34:26.411
Your men crossed the line, Stan.
Not till O.E.M. says they did.

34:26.414 --> 34:28.514
You're not dealing with O.E.M.
You're dealing with me.

34:28.516 --> 34:29.849
A lot of folks in this town

34:29.851 --> 34:31.284
think you walk on water, Frank,

34:31.286 --> 34:32.752
but I'm not one of 'em,
so say what you got to say,

34:32.754 --> 34:34.420
or stop wasting my time.

34:34.422 --> 34:36.522
I just did. You want me
to speak more slowly?

34:36.524 --> 34:37.556
Your men...

34:37.559 --> 34:38.858
Did their jobs.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.560
Risked the lives of my cops,

34:40.562 --> 34:42.628
and in doing so,
probably broke the law.

34:42.630 --> 34:43.529
So bust 'em.

34:43.531 --> 34:45.364
There's not a jury
in this town

34:45.366 --> 34:46.565
that gonna convict firefighters

34:46.568 --> 34:48.367
for heroically doing their job.

34:52.639 --> 34:56.007
Stan, did you give the order

34:56.010 --> 34:58.578
to ignore my officers
on the scene

34:58.580 --> 35:01.013
and engage that fire?

35:03.951 --> 35:06.152
No, I did not.

35:08.255 --> 35:10.790
If that's what you came for,
then we're done here.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.558
I got a meeting with the mayor.

35:15.095 --> 35:16.362
You like our mayor?

35:16.364 --> 35:19.599
He's a good man,
for a politician.

35:19.601 --> 35:21.267
So you don't like politicians.

35:21.269 --> 35:22.902
Not as a rule, no.

35:22.904 --> 35:24.036
Neither do I!

35:24.038 --> 35:25.538
So we agree on something.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.639
So?

35:26.641 --> 35:28.174
So we're both talking
like someone

35:28.176 --> 35:30.676
who, as a rule, we don't like.

35:33.514 --> 35:35.181
If our guys,

35:35.183 --> 35:37.750
starting with you and me,
can't get along,

35:37.752 --> 35:41.387
it is the people we serve
who get caught in the crossfire.

35:44.091 --> 35:45.391
You first.

35:47.427 --> 35:49.996
Well, you're right.

35:49.998 --> 35:54.100
No jury's gonna convict your men
for endangering mine.

35:54.102 --> 35:55.768
And I have no appetite
for the circus

35:55.770 --> 35:57.870
that arresting them would cause.

35:57.872 --> 36:00.640
So that's off the table?

36:00.642 --> 36:02.575
It can be.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.743
If?

36:03.745 --> 36:06.445
If... you make a public apology

36:06.447 --> 36:08.080
to my officer,

36:08.082 --> 36:10.950
Derek Redlich.

36:10.952 --> 36:12.718
I could make
a statement of regret.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.053
Released to the press.

36:14.055 --> 36:15.054
(chuckles)

36:15.056 --> 36:16.722
You love your newspaper ink.

36:16.724 --> 36:19.959
I love transparency
and full disclosure.

36:19.961 --> 36:21.761
Done.

36:21.763 --> 36:22.461
And...

36:22.463 --> 36:24.330
What "and"?

36:24.332 --> 36:25.798
And your word

36:25.800 --> 36:28.167
that your department
will defer to NYPD

36:28.169 --> 36:29.368
at all crime scenes.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.870
That has to be done retail.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.071
As it has throughout the history

36:32.073 --> 36:33.406
of both our
departments.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.808
It's that history
that got us into this mess.

36:35.810 --> 36:37.877
I'm not just FD;

36:37.879 --> 36:39.979
you're not just PD.

36:39.981 --> 36:42.949
I'm FDNY, you are NYPD.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.584
And that history,
that rivalry,

36:44.586 --> 36:46.352
is part of what made
this city great.

36:46.354 --> 36:48.154
I...

36:48.156 --> 36:50.756
I ain't messing
with that, Frank.

36:50.758 --> 36:53.826
You shouldn't, either.

36:59.366 --> 37:02.001
You'll copy my DCPI
on your statement?

37:03.670 --> 37:04.971
You got it.

37:06.873 --> 37:08.474
See you at
the next chicken dinner.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.577
From opposite
ends of the dais.

37:11.579 --> 37:13.179
Exactly.

37:16.216 --> 37:18.985
Good day, Frank.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.792
Good talk, Stan.

37:40.207 --> 37:41.607
What do you want, Marty?

37:41.609 --> 37:44.076
I heard you were
back in town, Vincent.

37:44.078 --> 37:45.378
We need to talk.

37:50.183 --> 37:51.851
There.

37:51.853 --> 37:52.952
(cocks hammer)

37:52.954 --> 37:54.287
That's better.

37:54.289 --> 37:55.988
What are you doing here, Marty?

37:55.990 --> 37:57.556
Every since
you turned rat,

37:57.558 --> 37:59.091
you keep some real
strange company.

37:59.093 --> 38:01.127
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:01.129 --> 38:03.496
Lady prosecutor accuses me
of clipping Ronald Green,

38:03.498 --> 38:04.864
then goes looking for you?

38:04.866 --> 38:06.666
She wanted witnesses.

38:06.668 --> 38:08.067
I gave her nothing.

38:08.069 --> 38:09.802
Why don't I believe you?

38:09.804 --> 38:11.804
Look, Green was a scumbag, okay?

38:11.806 --> 38:13.539
You protected his business

38:13.541 --> 38:15.074
and he held back your end.

38:16.310 --> 38:17.376
You had every right to pop him.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.278
Damn right I did.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.113
Now give me the name
of that witness

38:21.115 --> 38:22.114
before I pop you.

38:22.116 --> 38:24.750
I got no name

38:24.752 --> 38:26.085
of no witnesses.

38:26.087 --> 38:28.854
You're free and clear, Marty.

38:28.856 --> 38:31.557
Listen up, Rella.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.725
I'm gonna ask you
one more time...

38:32.727 --> 38:34.427
Drop the gun!

38:35.862 --> 38:38.264
Now!
You wearing a wire, Vincent?

38:38.266 --> 38:39.432
Once a cheese eater,

38:39.434 --> 38:41.000
always a cheese eater.
Don't make me

38:41.002 --> 38:43.235
do it, Marty.
Drop the gun now!

38:55.916 --> 38:57.316
Hey, you took
your sweet time.

38:57.318 --> 38:58.818
Yeah, I had you covered.

39:02.723 --> 39:06.158
Sorry it went down
like this, Marty.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.327
It's on me.

39:11.698 --> 39:13.399
See you, Jimmy.

39:19.773 --> 39:21.807
You okay?

39:21.809 --> 39:23.843
Another day
at the office.

39:23.845 --> 39:25.811
That puppy
nearly got me get killed.

39:25.813 --> 39:28.447
Well, the way I see it,
we nail Brock for killing Green

39:28.449 --> 39:30.383
or killing you.

39:30.385 --> 39:31.584
Either way we get our man.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.420
(chuckles)
You get what you need?

39:34.422 --> 39:37.757
Yes. You really went out
on a limb for me, Vincent.

39:37.759 --> 39:41.594
What can I do? I-I'm a sucker
for a pretty face.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.763
I'm sorry about your partner.

39:46.032 --> 39:49.201
Yeah, me too.
But he made his bed.

39:49.203 --> 39:52.238
I'm gonna go write this up.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.474
It's tough when friends
let you down.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.675
(soft chuckle)

39:56.677 --> 39:59.245
That's ironic
coming from a mob informant.

39:59.247 --> 40:02.715
Just for that,
you owe me a dinner.

40:02.717 --> 40:04.583
You sure you can
afford to be seen

40:04.585 --> 40:06.252
running around
with the D.A.'s office?

40:06.254 --> 40:08.754
There's a back room
at John and Tony's.

40:08.756 --> 40:10.489
I tell you what
I'm gonna do:

40:10.491 --> 40:12.658
I'm even gonna let you pay.

40:14.795 --> 40:16.762
Lucky me.

40:26.973 --> 40:29.008
I really wanted
to help her.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.142
I know that.

40:30.144 --> 40:31.944
So if part of this
is on me...

40:31.946 --> 40:33.279
No, it's not.

40:33.281 --> 40:35.114
I can deal
with that.

40:35.116 --> 40:36.849
But what I also know?

40:36.851 --> 40:39.919
I was hamstrung at every turn.

40:39.921 --> 40:42.955
From the city agencies
to our own lack of training

40:42.957 --> 40:45.224
inside the department
dealing with EDPs.

40:49.129 --> 40:50.663
Well...

40:50.665 --> 40:52.631
if it is a training issue,

40:52.633 --> 40:54.967
we could try to do something
about that.

40:54.969 --> 40:57.102
But the other variables,
not so much.

40:57.104 --> 40:59.538
But there are a thousand
Jenny Strongs out there.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.740
And unless something changes,

41:01.742 --> 41:04.109
they're gonna fall into some
really deep cracks.

41:06.012 --> 41:07.346
So, I'd...

41:07.348 --> 41:10.082
I'd like you to consider putting
up an advisory committee

41:10.084 --> 41:12.251
to study how the department
can do a better job

41:12.253 --> 41:14.453
in dealing with
the mentally ill.

41:14.455 --> 41:17.890
Comprised of?
The best people

41:17.892 --> 41:19.158
you can field.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.460
John Jay, Payne Whitney,

41:21.462 --> 41:22.995
Health and Human Services.

41:22.997 --> 41:25.564
And also from
the front lines here.

41:28.368 --> 41:31.170
I'll consider it.

41:31.172 --> 41:32.938
Under one condition.

41:32.940 --> 41:34.039
What's that?

41:34.041 --> 41:37.009
You bring me the list.

41:37.011 --> 41:40.646
The people you'd want
on a committee like that.

41:40.648 --> 41:43.349
Me? Um, I mean, okay, but...

41:43.351 --> 41:44.650
Yeah, no,

41:44.652 --> 41:46.218
with anyone else
it's just be an assignment.

41:46.220 --> 41:50.022
With you, right now...

41:50.024 --> 41:53.025
it's some kind of calling.

41:54.427 --> 41:57.730
So bring me a list

41:57.732 --> 42:00.432
and make sure you're on it.
