WEBVTT

00:06.700 --> 00:08.200
LOVE.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.300
SEX.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.567
SLANDER.

00:10.567 --> 00:12.400
EVEN THOUGH
<i>MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING </i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.934
WAS WRITTEN 400 YEARS AGO,

00:13.934 --> 00:16.233
SHAKESPEARE CAPTURED
RAW HUMAN EMOTION

00:16.233 --> 00:18.000
IN A WAY THAT IS
STILL RIVETING TODAY,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.033
STILL HAS US
GLUED TO OUR SEATS.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.934
THESE CHAIRS REALLY
AREN'T THE BEST
FOR SLEEPING.

00:37.934 --> 00:39.000
AW, COME ON.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.600
YOU GOT THIS
INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.967
SOMEBODY SAYS SHE SLEPT
WITH THIS OTHER GUY.

00:43.967 --> 00:46.500
HER REPUTATION IS SHOT,

00:46.500 --> 00:47.900
AND WE THINK
SHE'S KILLED HERSELF.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.400
WHERE WILL YOU FIND
THIS STUFF?

00:49.400 --> 00:50.600
<i>MELROSE PLACE? </i>

00:50.600 --> 00:51.867
<i>NYPD BLUE? </i>

00:51.867 --> 00:52.800
BARNEY?

00:54.300 --> 00:57.200
MY SISTER SAYS
HE'S GOTTEN EDGIER.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.700
MR. TURNER, WE JUST CAN'T
RELATE TO THESE CHARACTERS.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.033
WHY NOT?

01:02.033 --> 01:03.667
BECAUSE NOBODY
ACTS LIKE THIS.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.000
JUST BECAUSE SOME GUY
SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT SOME GIRL,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.834
SHE WANTS
TO KILL HERSELF?

01:07.834 --> 01:09.567
THEY SAY STUFF
ABOUT HEATHER LOCKLEAR,

01:09.567 --> 01:11.734
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO KILL HERSELF.

01:11.734 --> 01:13.800
SHE'S ON <i>TV GUIDE. </i>

01:13.800 --> 01:15.900
YOU'RE RIGHT, MATTHEWS.

01:15.900 --> 01:16.967
I'M RIGHT?

01:16.967 --> 01:18.400
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.233
AM I DONE
WITH MY EDUCATION?

01:20.233 --> 01:21.900
CAN I GO?

01:21.900 --> 01:24.367
IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY,
THE PLAY'S THE THING.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.567
IN OUR DAY IT'S TV.

01:26.567 --> 01:29.200
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
PUT OURSELVES ON TV

01:29.200 --> 01:30.734
AND ASK OURSELVES

01:30.734 --> 01:33.367
WHAT WE THINK ABOUT
LOVE, SEX, AND SLANDER.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.767
YOU MEAN
INTERVIEW EACH OTHER?

01:34.767 --> 01:36.600
KIND OF LIKE
A DOCUMENTARY?

01:36.600 --> 01:38.000
EXACTLY.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.900
MY UNCLE RALPH WAS
IN A DOCUMENTARY.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.000
THEY PUT A BLUE DOT
OVER HIS FACE

01:42.000 --> 01:43.400
AND CHANGED
HIS VOICE.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.467
THE SCHOOL'S GOT
VIDEO EQUIPMENT.

01:49.467 --> 01:50.600
LET'S WEAR IT OUT.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.000
WE'LL SPLIT INTO
TEAMS OF TWO

01:52.000 --> 01:53.400
AND MAKE VIDEO REPORTS.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.667
INTERVIEW FRIENDS,
FAMILIES, AND EACH OTHER.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.367
LET'S WHO'S GOT
THE MORE MATURE ATTITUDES--

01:58.367 --> 02:00.200
SHAKESPEARE OR US.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.300
US.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.934
REALLY? O.K.,
MY MATURE YOUNG FRIENDS,

02:04.934 --> 02:06.300
PICK PARTNERS.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.100
UH, BOY-GIRL PAIRS.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.767
MR. TURNER.
MR. FEENY.

02:17.767 --> 02:18.867
WHAT'S NEW?

02:18.867 --> 02:20.400
WHAT'S NEW?

02:20.400 --> 02:23.000
YES. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.500
WHAT'S SHAKING?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.400
WHAZZUP?

02:26.400 --> 02:30.000
YOU KNOW,
TEACHING THE KIDS,
MOLDING YOUNG MINDS.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.667
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

02:31.667 --> 02:33.600
WORD IN THE HALLS IS

02:33.600 --> 02:36.133
YOU'VE ABANDONED
THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH

02:36.133 --> 02:38.767
IN FAVOR OF SEX,
LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.934
OH. WE GIVE THEM
THESE BOOKS

02:41.934 --> 02:44.033
THAT HAVE THESE
CLASSIC SCENES OF ROMANCE,

02:44.033 --> 02:46.200
YET WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING

02:46.200 --> 02:47.500
ABOUT SEX AND LOVE.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.700
NEITHER DO THEY,
MR. TURNER.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.767
YOU ARE FUELING
A FIRE

02:52.767 --> 02:54.100
YOU SHOULD BE
PUTTING OUT.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.133
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM
FROM GROWING UP.

02:56.133 --> 02:58.000
YOU'VE GIVEN THEM
A VIDEO CAMERA

02:58.000 --> 03:00.700
AND A LICENSE TO
TALK OPENLY ABOUT SEX.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.900
THAT'S GROWING UP
TOO FAST.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.300
THIS ISN'T OUR PLACE.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.967
IT'S OUR PLACE TO SHOW THEM

03:05.967 --> 03:07.734
THAT CLASSIC LITERATURE
STILL APPLIES.

03:07.734 --> 03:10.967
SHOW THEM, THEN, BY...
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.300
TEACHING THEM?

03:12.300 --> 03:13.667
I CAN TEACH THEM BETTER

03:13.667 --> 03:15.967
IF THEY MAKE
THE CONNECTION THEMSELVES.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.867
MR. TURNER,
IN THE MATTER OF SEX,

03:18.867 --> 03:21.233
I PREFER
THEY MAKE NO CONNECTION

03:21.233 --> 03:23.500
UNTIL THEY'RE OUT
OF OUR JURISDICTION.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.900
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT THINKING'S ANTIQUATED?

03:25.900 --> 03:28.300
I PREFER TO THINK OF IT
AS CLASSIC.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.000
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PROJECT.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.367
I THINK IT'LL BE O.K.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.233
THAT'S WHAT
DR. FRANKENSTEIN SAID

03:33.233 --> 03:35.600
TO ALL
THE CURIOUS VILLAGERS

03:35.600 --> 03:37.500
ABOUT HIS
LITTLE PROJECT.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.300
HI. I'M TOPANGA LAWRENCE.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.100
IN CORY-VISION!

03:45.100 --> 03:47.233
WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

03:47.233 --> 03:49.934
HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT LOVE.

03:49.934 --> 03:52.567
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:52.567 --> 03:54.867
I'M ADDING STYLE
TO OUR PROJECT.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.567
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE
THE CAMERA.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.600
DON'T YOU WATCH
<i>NYPD BLUE? </i>

03:58.600 --> 04:01.100
SUBWAY. BROOKLYN.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.100
SQUAD CARS.
LOTS OF CURSING.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.600
MR. FEENY.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.000
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.500
HI. WE'LL BE STOPPING
PEOPLE IN THE HALL

04:11.500 --> 04:13.867
TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY'RE
PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE

04:13.867 --> 04:15.300
ABOUT SEX AND LOVE.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.133
[BELL RINGS]

04:20.200 --> 04:23.100
CORY, THERE'S NOBODY
IN THE HALL.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.367
O.K. THEN WE'LL
INTERVIEW YOU.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.100
TOPANGA, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT SEX?

04:28.100 --> 04:31.667
ME? OH, WELL,
SOME PEOPLE SAY SEX--

04:31.667 --> 04:33.500
GREAT ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.800
WHO SAYS THAT?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.900
EVERY BOY IN THE WORLD.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.233
OH, YEAH.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.033
TO BOYS, LET'S FACE IT,

04:40.033 --> 04:41.667
SEX IS JUST A GOAL.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.000
IT'S SOMETHING
THEY'RE AFTER,

04:43.000 --> 04:44.500
AND THEY'RE NOT
REALLY SURE WHY.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.000
I THINK SEX
IS PART OF A SPECIAL LOVE

04:47.000 --> 04:48.967
THAT YOU FEEL
FOR A VERY SPECIAL PERSON.

04:48.967 --> 04:51.867
YEAH, FINE. NOW LET'S
WAKE UP THE AUDIENCE.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.400
IT'S A CHASE SCENE!

04:53.400 --> 04:55.667
OH, YEAH. WE'RE GOING.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.000
HEY, MATTHEWS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
WE'RE MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.867
IT'S ABOUT
WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS
ABOUT LOVE AND STUFF.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.600
THAT'S COOL.
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.900
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU
WHEN IT'S DONE.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.000
COULD I BE IN IT?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.200
YOU'RE IN IT NOW.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.600
YOU ASK ME A QUESTION?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.200
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN

05:14.200 --> 05:15.900
AND [CHUCKLE] YOU KNOW?

05:15.900 --> 05:17.100
O.K. SEX IS VERY BEAUTIFUL,

05:17.100 --> 05:18.300
ESPECIALLY
WITHIN THE CONFINES

05:18.300 --> 05:20.233
OF A LOVING,
MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP,

05:20.233 --> 05:21.400
PREFERABLY MARRIAGE.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.033
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.600
THANKS. IS IT ALL RIGHT

05:24.600 --> 05:26.100
IF I SAY HI TO MY KIDS?

05:30.233 --> 05:32.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE?

05:32.367 --> 05:35.767
LOVE IS THE MOST
AMAZING, RARE,
AND PRECIOUS THING

05:35.767 --> 05:37.000
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.200
HAVE YOU EVER
FALLEN IN LOVE?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.867
FIVE TIMES A DAY.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.233
BABOON, JOEY TELLS ME

05:43.233 --> 05:47.000
YOU'RE SHOOTING
A DOCUMENTARY IN MY HALLWAY.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.467
DID I SAY YOU COULD SHOOT
A DOCUMENTARY IN MY HALLWAY?

05:50.467 --> 05:51.934
IT'S O.K.
IT'S FOR SCHOOL.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.033
YEAH, YEAH, SCHOOL.

05:53.033 --> 05:55.700
NEVERTHELESS,
HERE I SEE YOU SHOOTING

05:55.700 --> 05:57.500
WITHOUT
THE PROPER PERMITS.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.600
PERMITS?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.400
WHAT HARLEY NEEDS HERE

06:00.400 --> 06:03.500
IS A LOCATION FEE AND
AN EQUIPMENT RENTAL FEE.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.867
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

06:04.867 --> 06:05.967
HOW MUCH YOU GOT?

06:05.967 --> 06:07.400
3 BUCKS.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.300
3 BUCKS, BUT IF YOU LET
HARLEY POUND YOUR FACE,

06:09.300 --> 06:11.567
WE'LL WORK OUT A DISCOUNT.

06:11.567 --> 06:15.400
MAYBE WE CAN AVOID
THIS MONEY AND FACE-POUNDING

06:15.400 --> 06:18.000
IF YOU FELT PERSONALLY
INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.867
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

06:19.867 --> 06:22.400
I'LL PUT YOU IN THE FILM.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.500
PICTURE IT--

06:23.500 --> 06:27.567
<i>SEX, </i>
STARRING HARLEY KINER.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.667
O.K., BABOON.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.367
MAKE ME A STAR.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.600
O.K. HARLEY, TELL AMERICA.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.500
WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR
IN A WOMAN?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
WELL, THAT'S
A VERY PERSONAL SUBJECT

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I HAVE MANY THOUGHTS ON.

06:44.767 --> 06:47.000
JOEY, TELL 'EM
WHAT I THINK.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.600
O.K., TOPANGA, WHO ARE WE
TALKING TO NEXT?

06:54.600 --> 06:55.767
HOW ABOUT YOU?

06:55.767 --> 06:59.033
NO. I'M A BEHIND-THE-CAMERA
KIND OF GUY.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.300
I'LL RUN THE CAMERA.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.033
I'VE ESTABLISHED
A VISUAL STYLE.

07:02.033 --> 07:03.400
I'M A SERIOUS ARTIST.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.500
NO, DON'T TICKLE ME!

07:04.500 --> 07:06.100
THEN GIVE ME
THE CAMERA!

07:06.100 --> 07:07.367
YOU DON'T HAVE MY VISION!

07:09.400 --> 07:13.667
HI, MR. FEENY.
DO HAVE AN OPINION
ON LOVE AND SEX?

07:13.667 --> 07:16.867
YES. MY OPINION IS:
NOT ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.600
BE CAREFUL WITH
THAT VALUABLE EQUIPMENT.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.233
[CORY]
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT--

07:21.233 --> 07:24.500
LOVE OR...YOU KNOW,
THE OTHER THING.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.300
LOVE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN THE WORLD.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.300
LOVE'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SEX WORTH HAVING.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.200
HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN IN LOVE?

07:32.200 --> 07:33.700
NOT YET.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.200
IT'S SOMETHING
I'M HOPING FOR.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.800
I KNOW IT'LL HAPPEN.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.033
SO, HAVE YOU EVER HAD...
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING?

07:40.033 --> 07:41.500
WHAT?

07:41.500 --> 07:44.600
HAVE YOU EVER HAD...
YOU KNOW?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.667
BECAUSE YOU SAID
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.567
IF YOU HAD "YOU KNOW"
WITHOUT LOVE,

07:48.567 --> 07:50.500
THEN "YOU KNOW" MUST NOT
HAVE BEEN ANY GOOD.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.934
WHO ARE YOU,
MIKE WALLACE?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.133
HI.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.600
I'M A ROMANTIC GUY,

07:55.600 --> 07:57.200
SO TO ME,
LOVE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.600
GIRLS, I'M CURRENTLY
AVAILABLE.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.700
GOOD, AND IF THIS WERE
A DATING SERVICE, I'D CARE.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.767
TALK ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDES
TOWARDS LOVE.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.300
I'M IN FAVOR.

08:06.300 --> 08:07.967
I'M ALSO IN FAVOR
OF CANDLELIT DINNERS

08:07.967 --> 08:10.133
AND LONG, ROMANTIC WALKS
ON THE BEACH.

08:10.133 --> 08:12.033
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.400
THE QUESTION IS
AM I THE GUY FOR YOU?

08:14.400 --> 08:15.600
CUT!

08:15.600 --> 08:17.200
NOW?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.300
HI. WE'RE CORY'S PARENTS.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.900
YES, WE ARE.
BOTH OF US.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.767
I'M ERIC MATTHEWS,
THE GUY FOR YOU.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.000
HERE'S THE PHONE.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.967
TWO OPERATORS
ARE STANDING BY. CALL NOW.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.467
[CORY]
O.K., HERE'S THE DEAL.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.233
I NEED YOU TO BE
VERY MATURE ABOUT THIS

08:32.233 --> 08:35.133
AND TALK ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, S-E-X.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.567
ON CAMERA?

08:36.567 --> 08:37.700
IT'S FOR SCHOOL.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.400
WHAT THE HECK ARE
THEY TEACHING YOU?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.600
I'LL GO FIRST.
I'LL BE VERY DIRECT.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.133
SEX IS LIKE VOTING.

08:44.133 --> 08:48.233
IT'S A PRIVILEGE
THAT YOU MAY CHOOSE
TO EXERCISE

08:48.233 --> 08:50.100
WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.600
GO ON.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.000
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY

08:53.000 --> 08:55.900
YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG
OR HAVE STRONG FEELINGS FOR

08:55.900 --> 08:59.233
BECAUSE YOU MAY BE
STUCK WITH THAT PERSON.

08:59.233 --> 09:01.100
YES, SEX
IS LIKE VOTING.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.200
YOU GO
BEHIND A CURTAIN,
DO YOUR THING,

09:03.200 --> 09:06.567
THEN YOU DO IT AGAIN
IN FOUR YEARS.

09:06.567 --> 09:09.700
<i>TOPANGA, HOW DO YOU </i>
<i>FEEL ABOUT SEX? </i>

09:09.700 --> 09:12.867
<i>ME? OH, WELL, </i>
<i>SOME PEOPLE SAY SEX-- </i>

09:12.867 --> 09:14.300
<i>GREAT ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. </i>

09:14.300 --> 09:16.400
STOP. STOP. REWIND.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.700
LISTEN, WE HAVE TO
MAKE CUTS ON THIS.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.667
TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.400
<i>TOPANGA, HOW DO YOU </i>
<i>FEEL ABOUT SEX? </i>

09:25.400 --> 09:26.867
<i>GREAT ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. </i>

09:26.867 --> 09:28.367
I'LL KILL YOU!

09:28.367 --> 09:29.767
YOU CAN'T KILL ME.

09:29.767 --> 09:30.867
I'M HALF YOUR GRADE.

09:30.867 --> 09:34.600
THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE ALL NIGHT.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.133
HI, MOM.
I'M AT CORY'S.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.767
I'M GOING
TO HAVE DINNER
OVER HERE, O.K.?

09:38.767 --> 09:41.500
YEAH, THEY'LL
GIVE ME A RIDE HOME.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.400
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.200
THIS WAY, THEY WON'T
MAKE ME COME HOME
FOR DINNER.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.300
WE CAN
GET THIS DONE.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.700
PRETTY SMOOTH.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.700
NOW WATCH THE KING.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.800
HI, MOM.
I'M AT CORY'S.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.400
D'OH!

09:56.400 --> 09:59.767
MRS. MATTHEWS?
CAN CORY HAVE DINNER
AT MY HOUSE?

09:59.767 --> 10:02.867
WE'RE WORKING
ON THE PROJECT
OVER HERE, O.K.?

10:02.867 --> 10:03.800
O.K.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.300
BYE.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.967
NICE WORK, KING.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.500
ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S NEXT?

10:16.133 --> 10:17.900
<i>LOVE IS REALLY GREAT. </i>

10:17.900 --> 10:20.233
<i>IT'S EVEN BETTER </i>
<i>IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE </i>

10:20.233 --> 10:21.967
<i>WHO LIKES YOU BETTER </i>
<i>THAN YOU LIKE HER, </i>

10:21.967 --> 10:24.500
<i>'CAUSE THEN </i>
<i>SHE'LL PAY FOR STUFF. </i>

10:24.500 --> 10:28.300
<i>IF SHE'S PAYING, </i>
<i>LOVE IS WAY COOL. </i>

10:28.300 --> 10:29.667
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.600
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.300
HOW MANY MORE TAPES?

10:39.300 --> 10:40.967
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THIS ONE?

10:42.867 --> 10:45.033
YOU INTERVIEWED
JANITOR BUD?

10:48.967 --> 10:51.900
<i>WHAT DO THE LADIES </i>
<i>RESPOND TO EXACTLY? </i>

10:51.900 --> 10:54.400
<i>IT'S THE UNIFORM. </i>
<i>A TURN-ON. </i>

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
<i>I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. </i>

10:56.400 --> 10:58.233
<i>[BEEPING] </i>

10:58.233 --> 10:59.800
<i>V.I.C.--UH-OH. </i>

10:59.800 --> 11:02.000
<i>THAT'S VOMIT </i>
<i>IN THE CAFETERIA. </i>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
<i>GOT TO GO. </i>

11:03.000 --> 11:05.100
<i>GOOD LUCK </i>
<i>WITH YOUR SHOW, HONEY. </i>

11:07.500 --> 11:11.400
YOU WASTED VIDEOTAPE
ON THIS?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:13.467 --> 11:14.867
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

11:14.867 --> 11:16.300
I'M NOT SLEEPING.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.834
I HEAR EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.100
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU'RE SLEEPING.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.300
I'M NOT SLEEPING.
JUST GIVE ME 10 MINUTES.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.200
I SWEAR, 10 MINUTES,
I'LL BE FRESH.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.567
FINE.
I'LL DO THIS MYSELF.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.033
I JUST CALLED
TOPANGA'S PARENTS,
AND THERE'S NO ANSWER.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.500
MAYBE
THEY'RE VOTING.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.700
THEY'RE PROBABLY
BRINGING CORY HOME.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.100
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.300
I'M GONNA TURN IN.
YOU WAIT UP, O.K.?

11:45.300 --> 11:47.667
WHEN HE GETS HOME,
CAN I WAKE YOU UP?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.100
WHAT FOR?

11:49.100 --> 11:53.934
TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT
AS AN AMERICAN.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.233
OH, THAT.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.500
NO, LET ME SLEEP.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.800
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, HONEY.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.800
THERE'S ANOTHER ELECTION
NEXT NOVEMBER.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.400
ALAN.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.000
ALAN, IT'S 7:00
IN THE MORNING.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.200
WHERE'S CORY?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
HE MUST BE
IN HIS ROOM.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
WELL, HE BETTER BE.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.033
I'M CERTAIN HE IS.

12:16.033 --> 12:18.000
WAIT. I'LL GO LOOK.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.834
MR. FEENY.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.200
GOOD MORNING,
JANITOR BUD.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.500
HAVE I GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.400
NOT ANOTHER SQUIRREL
IN THE BOYS'
LOCKER ROOM.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.767
BETTER.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.567
I TRIED POKING THEM
WITH MY MOP. NOTHING.

12:42.567 --> 12:45.300
WANT ME TO SPILL SOME
AMMONIA ON THEIR HEADS?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.400
AHEM.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.500
FIVE MORE MINUTES, MOM.

12:54.767 --> 12:56.734
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.400
BREAKFAST
IS ON THE TABLE.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.100
TODAY WE'RE HAVING
A BIG BOWL

13:00.100 --> 13:03.734
OF YOU'VE-GOT-
A-LOT-OF-EXPLAINING-TO-DO.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.500
YES.
THEY'RE BOTH FINE, AMY.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.834
NOW, BE PATIENT.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.300
YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR CHANCE WITH THEM

13:12.300 --> 13:14.367
AFTER I HAVE MINE.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.934
TAKE CARE, NOW.

13:15.934 --> 13:18.767
I GOT TO GO CHANGE
AND SHOWER.

13:18.767 --> 13:21.100
OTHERWISE,
I'LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.100
SIT!

13:23.100 --> 13:26.000
THE TWO OF YOU
SPENT THE NIGHT UNSUPERVISED

13:26.000 --> 13:27.734
ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.

13:27.734 --> 13:30.233
MR. FEENY,
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAP--

13:31.400 --> 13:34.100
OH, MY GOD.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.300
MR. FEENY,
NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.734
HOW COULD YOU
THINK THAT?

13:37.734 --> 13:40.000
WE'RE
TOTALLY INNOCENT.
TELL HIM, CORY.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.233
OH, MY GOD!

13:43.233 --> 13:45.200
WE WERE WORKING
ON OUR DOCUMENTARY.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.100
I FELL ASLEEP, THEN
CORY FEEL ASLEEP.
THAT'S IT.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.300
SERIOUS VIOLATIONS LIKE THIS

13:50.300 --> 13:53.567
CALL FOR SWIFT,
DECISIVE ACTION.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.667
UH...

13:55.667 --> 13:57.934
WHILE I DECIDE
WHAT THAT IS,

13:57.934 --> 14:00.133
YOU'RE BOTH DISMISSED
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

14:00.133 --> 14:05.800
MR. FEENY, CAN WE KEEP
THIS LITTLE INCIDENT
BETWEEN US?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.800
OF COURSE, MISS LAWRENCE.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.667
TOTALLY HUSH-HUSH.
NO ONE NEED KNOW AT ALL.

14:22.734 --> 14:23.900
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:23.900 --> 14:25.600
YOU ARE A GOD.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.967
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.200
LIKE YOU DIDN'T
SPEND THE NIGHT
WITH TOPANGA.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.600
ALL WE DID WAS EDIT.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.100
CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.
YOU'RE THE MAN!

14:36.100 --> 14:38.100
I'M NOT THE MAN.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.400
THERE'S THE MAN.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.200
HERE HE IS.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.100
BARELY 3' HIGH,
NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT,

14:44.100 --> 14:49.400
BUT INSIDE, THERE LURKS
A LITTLE HARLEY KINER.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.100
SO, UH...
SO, MATTHEWS,

14:51.100 --> 14:53.100
TELL THE TRUTH NOW.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.367
DID YOU SLEEP
WITH TOPANGA?

14:55.367 --> 14:58.400
WELL, THAT'S A VERY PRIVATE,

14:58.400 --> 15:00.567
PERSONAL, INTIMATE QUES--

15:00.567 --> 15:02.834
HEY, ARE YOU
THE MAN?

15:02.834 --> 15:04.734
OR ARE YOU JUST YOU?

15:05.900 --> 15:07.567
I GUESS...

15:09.467 --> 15:11.300
I'M THE MAN.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.834
COME.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.100
LET US COMMEMORATE
THIS OCCASION.

15:21.834 --> 15:24.300
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.700
COME HERE.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.934
SO, MR. TURNER,
YOU'RE LITTLE PROJECT

15:28.934 --> 15:32.667
SEEMS TO HAVE SPIRALED
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.900
WHO COULD HAVE POSSIBLY
FORESEEN THAT?

15:34.900 --> 15:37.233
WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

15:37.233 --> 15:40.600
YES. YOU'VE PROVEN THAT
OUR ATTITUDES ABOUT SEX

15:40.600 --> 15:43.100
HAVE NOT CHANGED
FOR 400 YEARS,

15:43.100 --> 15:47.734
AND THAT A RUMOR
CAN STILL DESTROY
A YOUNG GIRL'S REPUTATION.

15:47.734 --> 15:50.100
RUMOR'S ONLY EXIST
WHEN THINGS AREN'T
IN THE OPEN.

15:50.100 --> 15:54.367
I WANTED THEM
TO MOVE FROM RUMORS
TO HONEST DISCUSSION.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.667
YOU GAVE THEM
AN ASSIGNMENT ABOUT SEX,

15:56.667 --> 15:58.734
THEN YOU LEFT THEM
UNSUPERVISED.

15:58.734 --> 16:00.100
YES, BECAUSE
I TRUST THEM.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.500
WAS YOUR TRUST JUSTIFIED?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.233
THE ASSIGNMENT
ISN'T IN YET.

16:03.233 --> 16:06.667
I SHOULD HAVE NIPPED
THIS IDEA IN THE BUD.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.600
NOT YOU.
WHAT?

16:08.600 --> 16:09.767
O.K.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.467
THEY COME DOWN HARD
ON YOU?

16:20.467 --> 16:23.000
MY KIDS ARE GROUNDED.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.133
COULD YOU SNEAK OUT
FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR?

16:26.133 --> 16:29.133
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M UNDER 24-HOUR WATCH.

16:29.133 --> 16:32.400
MAN, EVERYBODY'S
WAITING FOR YOU
DOWN AT CHUBBY'S.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.300
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU ARE A GOD.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.700
WHY IS THAT, SHAWN?

16:37.700 --> 16:40.000
WHY IS MY SON
SO GODLIKE AND POPULAR?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.300
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE
FINALLY BEGUN TO REALIZE

16:43.300 --> 16:44.700
HOW WELL BROUGHT UP
HE IS?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.300
IS THAT YOUR BEST SHOT?

16:46.300 --> 16:49.300
YEAH, WELL, MY MOM SMOKED
WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.300
GO HOME.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.100
THANK YOU.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.600
O.K., MR. POPULAR,
YOU'RE ON.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE AT SCHOOL
HAVE THIS WACKY IDEA

16:59.000 --> 17:00.767
THAT MORE HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND TOPANGA

17:00.767 --> 17:02.734
THAN HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND TOPANGA.

17:02.734 --> 17:03.834
WHAT DO THEY THINK?

17:03.834 --> 17:06.100
THAT I SLEPT WITH HER.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.400
WHY DO THEY THINK THAT?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.867
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY I DID.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.900
AND TECHNICALLY,
YOU DIDN'T CLEAR UP
THIS MISCONCEPTION?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.967
THEY THINK
I'M SOMEBODY NOW.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.200
GUYS WHO BEAT ME UP

17:16.200 --> 17:18.100
WANTED THEIR PICTURE
TAKEN WITH ME.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.600
CORY, TOPANGA'S
HERE TO SEE YOU.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.967
SHE'S WAITING
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

17:21.967 --> 17:24.667
O.K. COULD YOU TELL HER
I'M NOT HERE?

17:24.667 --> 17:28.900
OF COURSE. THAT WOULD BE
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.500
TOPANGA,
HE'S RIGHT IN HERE.

17:32.867 --> 17:35.900
IF WE STAYED,
WOULD IT BE EASIER
FOR YOU?

17:35.900 --> 17:37.367
YEAH, IT WOULD.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.100
HEY, TOPANGA.
HOW YOU DOING?

17:45.100 --> 17:48.133
NOT GREAT,
BUT I HEAR YOU'RE
DOING PRETTY GOOD.

17:48.133 --> 17:52.800
LOOK, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TALK,

17:52.800 --> 17:54.967
BUT THAT'S ALL IT IS--
JUST TALK.

17:54.967 --> 17:57.000
SOON THEY'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.467
IT'LL BE LIKE
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

17:59.467 --> 18:00.600
YOU WANT ME, CORY?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.000
WHAT?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.300
YOU HEARD ME.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.500
YOU WANT ME,
TAKE ME.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.600
EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU DID IT ALREADY,
SO GO AHEAD.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.934
COME ON, TOPANGA. STOP.

18:09.934 --> 18:12.500
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CORY?
AREN'T YOU THE MAN?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.800
I SAID WHAT I SAID

18:13.800 --> 18:16.233
BECAUSE EVERYONE
WANTED ME TO.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.734
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.133
I WANT
MY GOOD NAME BACK.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.200
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT ARGUE

18:24.200 --> 18:27.200
THAT TOPANGA'S NOT
THE BEST NAME TO BEGIN WITH.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.000
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, CORY,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.200
AND I HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.600
I FEEL LIKE YOU USED
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.500
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.300
BUT I DON'T LIKE YOU.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.200
O.K., EVERYBODY.
SETTLE DOWN.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.800
SETTLE DOWN.
IT'S SHOWTIME.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.767
FIRST UP, THE TAPE
BY TOPANGA AND MATTHEWS.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.300
OOH.
OOH.
OOH.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.667
YOU'RE IN THIS CLASS?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.467
I'M IN THE MOVIE.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.000
MR. TURNER, A WORD.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.200
MR. FEENY.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.467
YOU HERE
TO WATCH THE TAPE?

19:04.467 --> 19:07.400
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
TO EXPRESS MY SURPRISE

19:07.400 --> 19:09.133
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO WATCH THE TAPE.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.400
ANY CHANCE YOU'LL
RETHINK THAT DECISION?

19:12.667 --> 19:14.400
ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.467
MR. FEENY
IS OF THE OPINION

19:16.467 --> 19:19.800
THAT OUR DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT SEX, LOVE,
GOSSIP, AND SLANDER

19:19.800 --> 19:23.734
CAN ONLY LEAD
TO MORE SEX, LOVE,
GOSSIP, AND SLANDER.

19:23.734 --> 19:25.967
I HAVE TO SAY,
SO FAR HE'S RIGHT.

19:25.967 --> 19:28.100
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS TAPE,

19:28.100 --> 19:31.300
BUT I HOPE MY TRUST
HASN'T BEEN MISPLACED.
HAS IT?

19:31.300 --> 19:33.200
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?

19:34.467 --> 19:36.133
MATTHEWS?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.567
I THINK IF
WE DON'T WATCH IT,

19:38.567 --> 19:40.200
WE'LL NEVER KNOW
ANYTHING.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.967
MY STUDENT SAYS
WE SHOULD SHOW IT.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.800
WELL, THEN,
PERHAPS WE SHOULD.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.033
<i>WHAT IS YOUR MOST </i>
<i>IMPORTANT ADVICE </i>

19:54.033 --> 19:55.834
<i>FOR TEENAGERS ABOUT SEX? </i>

19:55.834 --> 19:58.100
<i>BE CAREFUL WITH THAT </i>
<i>VALUABLE EQUIPMENT. </i>

20:00.033 --> 20:03.033
CHEAP EDITING TRICK.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.567
<i>SEX IS PART OF </i>
<i>A SPECIAL LOVE </i>

20:05.567 --> 20:07.467
<i>YOU FEEL </i>
<i>FOR A SPECIAL PERSON. </i>

20:07.467 --> 20:09.800
<i>LOVE'S THE MOST </i>
<i>IMPORTANT THING. </i>

20:09.800 --> 20:12.700
<i>LOVE'S THE ONLY THING </i>
<i>THAT MAKES SEX WORTH HAVING. </i>

20:12.700 --> 20:14.700
<i>SEX IS PART </i>
<i>OF A SPECIAL LOVE... </i>

20:14.700 --> 20:17.834
<i>LOVE'S THE MOST </i>
<i>AMAZING, RARE, </i>
<i>AND PRECIOUS THING </i>

20:17.834 --> 20:19.200
<i>IN THE WHOLE WORLD. </i>

20:19.200 --> 20:21.200
<i>YOU FEEL FOR </i>
<i>A SPECIAL PERSON. </i>

20:22.400 --> 20:24.367
<i>HI. </i>

20:24.367 --> 20:26.300
<i>I DIDN'T WANT TO BE </i>
<i>IN THIS DOCUMENTARY </i>

20:26.300 --> 20:30.000
<i>BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE </i>
<i>MUCH TO SAY ABOUT SEX. </i>

20:30.000 --> 20:31.100
WHAT'S THIS?

20:31.100 --> 20:32.500
A SPECIAL
DIRECTOR'S CUT.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.967
<i>THE REASON I DON'T HAVE </i>
<i>MUCH TO SAY ABOUT SEX </i>

20:35.967 --> 20:39.800
<i>IS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE </i>
<i>A LOT OF EXPERIENCE </i>

20:39.800 --> 20:40.967
<i>IN THAT AREA. </i>

20:40.967 --> 20:43.467
<i>SOME PEOPLE THINK I DO, </i>
<i>BUT I DON'T. </i>

20:43.467 --> 20:48.467
<i>IF I LET PEOPLE THINK </i>
<i>I HAD SOME EXPERIENCE </i>
<i>WITH SOMEONE, </i>

20:48.467 --> 20:51.467
<i>WELL, IT REALLY ISN'T FAIR </i>
<i>TO THAT PERSON </i>

20:51.467 --> 20:53.667
<i>THAT I DIDN'T HAVE </i>
<i>THE EXPERIENCE WITH. </i>

20:53.667 --> 20:58.967
PERHAPS THIS PROJECT
WILL SERVE SOME PURPOSE
AFTER ALL.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.300
I'M SHOCKED.
ME, TOO.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.700
<i>SO I'D LIKE TO SAY </i>
<i>I'M SORRY TO THAT PERSON, </i>

21:04.700 --> 21:08.033
<i>AND I SHOULD HAVE ACTED </i>
<i>MORE MATURE. </i>

21:08.033 --> 21:12.000
<i>MAYBE WE HAVEN'T COME AS </i>
<i>FAR AS WE'D LIKE TO THINK </i>

21:12.000 --> 21:13.700
<i>IN THE LAST 400 YEARS. </i>

21:15.500 --> 21:17.600
<i>O.K., CUT IT, SHAWN. </i>

21:17.600 --> 21:19.200
<i>STOP THE CAMERA, SHAWN. </i>

21:19.200 --> 21:22.000
<i>O.K., NOW TELL HER </i>
<i>HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HER. </i>

21:22.000 --> 21:23.500
<i>SHUT UP. I DO NOT. </i>

21:23.500 --> 21:26.567
<i>THEN WHY DO THIS </i>
<i>IF YOU DON'T LOVE HER? </i>

21:26.567 --> 21:28.000
<i>BECAUSE SHE'S MY FRIEND. </i>

21:28.000 --> 21:29.767
<i>[KISSING SOUNDS] </i>

21:29.767 --> 21:32.000
<i>WILL YOU STOP </i>
<i>THE CAMERA, SHAWN? </i>

21:32.000 --> 21:33.400
<i>SHAWN! </i>

21:34.500 --> 21:35.400
FRIEND?

21:37.567 --> 21:38.600
FRIEND.

21:48.567 --> 21:50.800
WHEN WE READ THESE BOOKS
IN CLASS,

21:50.800 --> 21:54.400
IT SEEMS THAT THE AUTHORS
CONSTRUCT SCENES OF LOVE

21:54.400 --> 21:58.300
WHICH TO ME DO NOT SEEM
BASED IN REALITY.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.300
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF REALITY?

22:01.300 --> 22:02.600
A MOONLIT NIGHT,

22:02.600 --> 22:05.667
THE BACK SEAT
OF MY CHEVY IMPALA,

22:05.667 --> 22:07.967
AND THE LILT OF SOME
SWEET GIRL'S VOICE

22:07.967 --> 22:09.400
WHISPERING
IN MY EAR,

22:09.400 --> 22:12.100
"HEY, YOU'RE CRUSHING
MY CIGARETTES."

22:12.100 --> 22:13.767
THAT'S LOVE.
