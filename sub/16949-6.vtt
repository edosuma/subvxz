00:03.169 --> 00:05.572
{\an8}Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.638 --> 00:08.375
{\an7}So, what about you?
You dealing with anybody else?

00:08.441 --> 00:10.610
{\an8}It's not like, oh, I have
another man or whatever.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.178
{\an8}It's just, I'm working.

00:12.245 --> 00:14.247
{\an7}So, you're not seeing
anybody else?

00:14.314 --> 00:15.915
{\an8}No. I mean...

00:15.982 --> 00:17.350
{\an7}And you don't feel like
you need to, like,

00:17.417 --> 00:19.919
{\an7}tell somebody,
one of them?

00:19.986 --> 00:22.255
{\an7}The things that I see that
look like it could be wrong,

00:22.322 --> 00:23.323
{\an7}I'm not gonna sit there
and let it

00:23.390 --> 00:24.824
{\an7}just keep on building
and building.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.726
{\an8}I'm on your side.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.729
{\an8}Yeah! Ah-ha-ha-ha!

00:29.796 --> 00:31.698
{\an7}So, what you doing?
You selling them online?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.933
{\an8}I sell them online,
and I got the Melrose
store opening up.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.068
{\an8}Oh, this is a movie.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.302
{\an7}That's why I want you--
I want to do--

00:36.369 --> 00:37.604
{\an7}I want to do
a grand opening with you.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.671
{\an8}Let's do it.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.273
{\an7}You got me looking
(bleep) stupid.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.574
{\an8}And I apologize
for that.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.710
{\an7}So, what the (bleep)
were you trying to do?

00:43.777 --> 00:46.379
{\an8}When's the last time
you seen this bitch?

00:46.446 --> 00:47.914
{\an8}Listen, this situation--

00:46.446 --> 00:47.914
{\an8}Why are you lying, Lucky?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.482
{\an8}Why are you lying?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.482
{\an8}I am not-- Don't call me Lucky.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.784
{\an7}That (bleep) was dead
years ago.

00:50.850 --> 00:51.885
{\an9}Why not?

00:50.850 --> 00:51.885
{\an8}Why are you here?

00:51.951 --> 00:54.421
{\an8}I was still
in love with you!

00:54.487 --> 00:55.488
{\an8}Will...

00:55.555 --> 00:57.090
{\an8}I'm sick of the bull(bleep).

00:57.157 --> 00:59.159
{\an8}I'm done arguing
and stressing.

00:59.225 --> 01:03.129
{\an8}I think it's time for me to take
a step back from my marriage.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.531
{\an8}You took my son's money.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.332
{\an8}You lied about where
the (bleep) you was going.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.634
{\an8}Come back in here

01:07.700 --> 01:09.235
{\an7}and don't leave me
in the middle of the store!

01:09.302 --> 01:11.404
{\an7}I'm not done talking
to you yet. Don't leave.

01:11.471 --> 01:12.872
{\an9}No!

01:12.939 --> 01:15.275
{\an8}No! No, no, no!

01:15.341 --> 01:18.611
{\an7}Don't sit up here and act
like I'm not worth it.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.414
{\an7}You come home
for me and the baby.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.284
{\an8}I've spent the last few weeks
in my new mommy heaven,

01:58.351 --> 02:00.220
{\an8}but baby girl's
almost five weeks old,

02:00.286 --> 02:01.921
and it's time for mommy
to go back to work

02:01.988 --> 02:04.457
because these diapers
do not buy themselves.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.959
{\an1}Hey.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.959
{\an3}Sika. Sika.

02:06.025 --> 02:06.993
How you doing?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.428
{\an6}What's up?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.428
Good to see you.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.363
{\an5}How you been?

02:08.495 --> 02:10.363
Good, good.

02:10.430 --> 02:14.000
{\an8}I still ain't been home
since B dropped that 27K ball.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.302
{\an8}Things is as rocky
as Mount Everest,

02:16.369 --> 02:18.271
{\an8}and until they get
back smooth,

02:18.338 --> 02:20.473
I'm planning my own
financial success.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.708
What's the deal with you?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.376
Other than having a baby...

02:23.443 --> 02:24.878
Congratulations,
by the way.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.312
{\an1}Thank you.
Thank you.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.647
Last time
I saw you was, like,

02:27.714 --> 02:29.215
you was in the studio
working on a record

02:29.282 --> 02:30.884
{\an5}like a year
and a half ago.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.884
{\an1}Yes.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.752
{\an1}I'm obsessed with
that record, first of all.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.953
I love the record.
We was, like...

02:34.020 --> 02:35.421
{\an5}Well, thank you.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.421
We was moving forward,

02:35.488 --> 02:37.690
and everything just
kind of, like, went left.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.092
The first time
I worked with Max,

02:39.158 --> 02:40.927
I was introduced to him
by another producer

02:40.994 --> 02:43.630
who wanted to do more
than just produce,

02:43.696 --> 02:44.998
and when I didn't
reciprocate,

02:45.064 --> 02:46.266
he got in his feelings,

02:46.332 --> 02:48.568
and the record
just kind of disappeared.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.103
I don't know how you feel.

02:50.169 --> 02:53.206
{\an1}I would love to move forward
with that record,

02:53.273 --> 02:54.874
maybe cut some
more records.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.309
{\an1}My child is almost
five weeks old,

02:56.376 --> 02:59.078
so I don't have time
for anything but her

02:59.145 --> 03:00.980
and my future
and my career.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.549
{\an1}These girls
are getting younger.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.650
{\an1}Their waists
are getting smaller.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.251
Their asses are
getting bigger.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.753
I'm almost 30 here.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.221
{\an1}I don't have time
to be playing around.

03:08.288 --> 03:13.159
{\an1}I just feel like I want to catch
this wave while she's young,

03:13.226 --> 03:16.563
but I do have one concern.

03:16.629 --> 03:18.531
I've heard about your wife.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.167
{\an1}I've never met her,
but I do know

03:21.234 --> 03:23.870
that she pops up on the studio
sessions and things like that.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.238
It's not gonna be
an issue with her.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.606
{\an5}Let me deal with her.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.606
{\an1}Okay.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.942
We already know that Brandi
has a reputation,

03:29.008 --> 03:30.610
but to make matters worse,

03:30.677 --> 03:34.681
her so-called bestie is supposed
to be dating the producer

03:34.747 --> 03:37.951
that tried to hit on me
that introduced me to Max.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.485
It's all business for me.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.588
I don't want your man.
I want this hit.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.190
So, I definitely want to
get with you, like, ASAP.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.525
Let's get on the phone,

03:45.592 --> 03:46.759
set up a session,
and get in studio.

03:46.826 --> 03:47.760
{\an1}Okay.

03:46.826 --> 03:47.760
{\an3}Okay?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.462
Deal. I'm down.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.462
{\an3}Deal.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.464
♪♪

03:55.468 --> 03:57.270
{\an7}Hey.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.270
{\an9}Hey.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.039
{\an8}So, you find
anything you like?

04:00.106 --> 04:01.140
Yeah, this is beautiful.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.009
{\an1}Is this-- What is this,
table linens?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.544
Yes, they are.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.012
{\an8}Diann Valentine

04:06.079 --> 04:08.448
{\an8}is one of the top wedding
planners in the industry.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.083
She's done
Evelyn and Chad's wedding,

04:10.149 --> 04:13.119
Toni Braxton's wedding,
Lela Rochon's wedding,

04:13.186 --> 04:14.420
just to name a few.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.856
So, tell me
about Ray's family.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.125
They're all, like, really
involved with each other.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.329
{\an7}It's like, they are what I wish
I would have had growing up.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.531
So is Ray's mom excited
about the wedding?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.567
{\an1}His mom is so hard
to figure out.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.735
{\an3}Okay.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.735
His dad's happy.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.104
His sister's happy.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.039
I don't really know
if his mom's happy.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.341
Ray tries to convince me

04:35.408 --> 04:37.677
that his mother
is for our relationship,

04:37.744 --> 04:39.746
but I just know that

04:39.812 --> 04:43.216
she just doesn't want
to let go of her baby boy.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.418
So, I also want you guys
to start thinking about,

04:45.485 --> 04:46.786
you know,
how many bridesmaids,

04:46.853 --> 04:48.888
how many groomsmen,
what are they gonna wear.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.757
Are we gonna do
custom tuxedos?

04:50.823 --> 04:51.958
Are we gonna
rent them?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.526
Think about entertainment
and music.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.328
Are we gonna do live music
at the ceremony?

04:55.395 --> 04:56.829
Gonna do recorded music?

04:56.896 --> 04:58.364
Do you want
any singers to sing?

04:58.431 --> 05:01.000
Are we gonna do a band?
Are we gonna do a DJ?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.068
What kind of party
are we gonna have?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.270
{\an5}What kind of fun--

05:02.135 --> 05:04.270
Okay, okay.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.838
Diann is freaking me out.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.709
I know that I have a lot to do,
but I need to take baby steps.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.177
I'm worried now.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.545
But you got me.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.213
All those things
you just named,

05:14.280 --> 05:15.915
it worries me
because it's,

05:15.982 --> 05:17.917
you know, it's stuff that I
haven't even thought about.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.819
Yeah. Will Ray
be making decisions

05:19.886 --> 05:21.154
about things
in the wedding?

05:21.220 --> 05:22.321
Will it be you?

05:22.388 --> 05:23.756
Will it be
a joint effort?

05:23.823 --> 05:26.159
{\an1}I definitely think that he needs
to be involved, you know,

05:26.225 --> 05:28.828
{\an1}because he's the one that
wanted to get married so fast.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.997
{\an1}Why don't we do this?
Let's start with something fun.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.433
{\an1}So, why don't we start by going
and tasting some cake?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.001
{\an1}Okay.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.001
Does he like dessert?

05:35.068 --> 05:36.569
{\an1}Yeah.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.237
I think that's the perfect
place for us to start,

05:38.304 --> 05:39.539
and then I'll get
a chance to meet him

05:39.605 --> 05:40.907
and kind of hear
his thoughts as well.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.942
{\an1}Yeah. Can you write
this stuff down for me?

Yeah.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.587

06:35.528 --> 06:37.497
{\an1}It's just stressing me out,
you know, this wedding (bleep).

06:37.563 --> 06:39.532
{\an1}Man, you should have
just eloped.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.606
We married.

06:46.672 --> 06:47.607
{\an5}Know what I'm saying?

06:46.672 --> 06:47.607
Congratulations.

06:47.673 --> 06:48.808
{\an1}'Cause we been
building together.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.076
The last thing you want
is somebody

06:50.143 --> 06:51.778
to get inside
your mind--

06:51.844 --> 06:54.547
{\an1}your parents,
the people you love dearly--

06:54.614 --> 06:55.882
and then they rearrange
how you feel.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.350
{\an5}You know what I'm saying?

06:55.948 --> 06:57.350
{\an1}Right.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.685
Man, I wish I had these guys'
relationship problems.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.953
What I'm going through
in my marriage,

07:01.020 --> 07:02.889
I'll take any one of those
over this one.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.791
I haven't talked to Shanda
since she gave me the letter,

07:04.857 --> 07:06.125
so right now, I'm just trying
to stay positive

07:06.192 --> 07:08.027
and pray that we can
make things work.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.028
See, this is the thing.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.463
You out here
at Venice Beach.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.331
I saw you on TMZ.

07:12.398 --> 07:13.900
You know what I'm saying?
Walking around.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.334
{\an1}Yeah.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.334
With-- With--

07:15.401 --> 07:16.602
With old girl.

07:16.669 --> 07:17.637
{\an1}I don't know what
y'all talking about.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.105
It wasn't Nicki Nicki.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.640
It was Nikki Nikki.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.909
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.243
What's up with that, man?

07:24.310 --> 07:26.512
The paparazzi caught me
and Nikki out on a date.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.281
Now it's all over the blogs.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.283
This kind of ain't
what we really wanted,

07:30.349 --> 07:33.419
but it happened
and it is what it is.

07:33.486 --> 07:37.890
{\an1}We just went out to eat,
we leaving, paparazzi outside.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.959
{\an5}You like Nikki Baby?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.959
Yeah, he like Nikki Baby.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.794
Yeah, I like her a lot.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.797
{\an1}She good, man.
She got a good heart.

07:44.864 --> 07:47.066
(laughter)

07:47.133 --> 07:49.468
{\an8}Nikki has a big heart.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.205
{\an8}But-- But the real thing,
you know,

07:52.271 --> 07:54.874
is the different assets
that she carries.

07:54.941 --> 07:55.975
Look behind.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.010
Ooh, pow!
Oh, my God!

07:58.077 --> 07:59.478
But I'm engaged, though.

07:59.545 --> 08:00.980
So at the end of the day,
you know, that's just it.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.882
She cool. She cool.
She look cool.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.551
{\an1}But look. You know I got
the Scoot-E-Bike store, right?

08:05.618 --> 08:07.687
And you know what's
next door to my store.

08:07.753 --> 08:08.688
{\an3}Cossamia.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.656
That Rosa Acosta...

08:10.723 --> 08:12.124
{\an3}her shop.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.124
{\an1}Uh-huh.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.893
I heard they both...

08:13.960 --> 08:15.761
Know what I'm saying?
Like, one and one.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.597
When you say they one,
what you saying?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.765
Don't get your feelings
caught up in one.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.802
If she with somebody else,
you got to demand both.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.971
"I need to be (bleep)
with both of y'all!"

08:25.037 --> 08:27.106
{\an1}Yeah.

08:25.037 --> 08:27.106
(laughter)

08:27.173 --> 08:28.741
I really want
to settle down

08:28.808 --> 08:30.243
and be in a relationship
right now,

08:30.309 --> 08:33.346
but Nikki and Rosa?
Hmm.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.948
That's every bad man fantasy,
you see me?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.183
Ah.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.385
Normally, Ray J's advice
is a little crazy,

08:40.453 --> 08:43.890
but right now, I think he may
be on to something.

08:43.956 --> 08:44.891
This is what I'm gonna do.

08:44.957 --> 08:45.892
{\an1}I'm gonna go
meet her at, like,

08:45.958 --> 08:47.159
the next event she do,

08:47.226 --> 08:48.761
and then outside of all
the hoopla and all that,

08:48.828 --> 08:51.264
{\an1}we gonna go somewhere,
no cameras, none of that,

08:51.330 --> 08:53.165
{\an1}and I'm gonna just really be
like, "Yo, Ray told me..."

08:53.232 --> 08:54.600
{\an5}No, no, no, no...

08:53.232 --> 08:54.600
Should I say--

08:54.667 --> 08:56.636
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, don't tell me--

08:56.702 --> 08:58.404
Don't say
Ray said nothing.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.538
Like, I'm helping you.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.073
Don't expose, like--
I'm your--

09:01.140 --> 09:03.342
I'm like your
guardian angel, fam.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.977
This is what
you need to do.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.114
{\an1}You need to come in with one
of the magazines Rosa on

09:08.180 --> 09:10.616
and just put the magazine
down in front of her,

09:10.683 --> 09:12.285
and then you hit her
with the...

09:12.351 --> 09:13.519
"I want it all."

09:13.586 --> 09:15.588
And all she
gonna tell you is,

09:15.655 --> 09:17.356
"You can have
it all, Daddy."

09:17.423 --> 09:19.825
{\an5}(A1)
Ray's my guy,
but I'm not quite sure

09:19.892 --> 09:22.395
that Safaree should be
taking advice from him.

09:22.461 --> 09:25.598
Even if this was a good idea,
which it's not,

09:25.665 --> 09:27.833
I don't think Safaree
could pull it off.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.936
And that's it.
You either gonna lay down

09:30.002 --> 09:31.570
and they gonna
give it to you,

09:31.637 --> 09:34.640
or you gonna lay 'em down
and give it to them.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.309
{\an1}I'm gonna give it
to the both of them.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.877
{\an5}Congratulations.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.877
You want it all.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.178
Congratulations, man.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.947
{\an1}Wanted to talk.
Good to talk (bleep).

09:41.013 --> 09:43.516
We made it, Ma!
Top of the world!

09:43.582 --> 09:45.751
I'm gonna stay-- I'm gonna stay
here and work out though, man.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.921
Y'all gonna be
the lazy guys, okay?

09:48.988 --> 09:50.523
I want it all!

09:50.589 --> 09:51.991
{\an8}Coming up...

09:50.589 --> 09:51.991
{\an9}What's up?

09:52.058 --> 09:53.292
{\an8}Where's Nikki at?

09:53.359 --> 09:54.727
{\an8}I don't know
where she is.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.267
{\an8}What's up?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.435
{\an8}If I say there's no session,

10:02.501 --> 10:04.170
{\an8}there will be no session.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.170
{\an8}That's not true.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.705
{\an7}Oh, it's very
mother(bleep) true.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.073
{\an8}No! I don't (bleep)...

10:05.771 --> 10:07.073
{\an8}Get her out of my face.

10:07.139 --> 10:10.109
{\an8}Get her out of here.
Get her out of my face.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.244
{\an8}Can someone get this girl
out of my face?

10:12.311 --> 10:13.346
{\an7}(bleep)

10:19.885 --> 10:22.288
♪♪

10:28.728 --> 10:30.629
You look so pretty.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.629
{\an3}You too.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.365
{\an1}I love this skirt.
It's really cute on you.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.532
{\an3}Thank you.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.867
I will tell you
you can use it,

10:34.934 --> 10:37.036
but it's
not gonna fit.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.104
{\an1}Why?

10:38.170 --> 10:39.171
'Cause your ass
is too big.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.639
Why? What size
are your hips?

10:40.706 --> 10:42.074
I'm like a 38.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.377
There's no way...

10:42.141 --> 10:44.377
{\an3}I know.

10:44.443 --> 10:45.544
What's--
What's yours?

10:45.611 --> 10:46.812
{\an1}42.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.347
{\an1}Okay...
(laughing)

10:48.414 --> 10:50.383
{\an8}I'm still seeing
both Safaree and Rosa,

10:50.449 --> 10:51.684
{\an8}but I'm not gonna lie.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.252
The way me and Safaree
be going back and forth,

10:53.319 --> 10:54.820
he's been getting
on my nerves.

10:54.887 --> 10:55.921
I definitely
have been giving

10:55.988 --> 10:58.124
a lot more of my attention
to Rosa.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.792
{\an5}Hey.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.792
Ah, look who it is.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.427
What's up, shady?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.162
Isn't somebody
supposed to...

11:03.229 --> 11:05.398
Who's gonna do that
for you?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.134
Right now, Jason is not really
my favorite person.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.636
He is my friend and he did
introduce me to Rosa,

11:10.703 --> 11:12.138
but why the hell
are you gonna be messy

11:12.204 --> 11:14.273
and post that picture of me
and Safaree on your blog?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.307
How are you?

11:15.374 --> 11:16.742
{\an6}I'm good.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.742
Where you been?

11:16.809 --> 11:18.577
You know we've been trying
to call you.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.179
{\an5}I've been in New York.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.179
I mean, yeah,

11:20.246 --> 11:22.548
but you have your phone
on you, don't you?

11:22.615 --> 11:25.684
{\an1}Yeah, but being a global brand
is hard these days.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.453
{\an1}I'm working.
I'm all over the place.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.255
Okay, Jason.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.255
But I'm here.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.756
How are you?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.458
It's bad enough
that Jason's blog

11:32.525 --> 11:34.427
posted the pictures
of me and Safaree,

11:34.493 --> 11:36.529
but then you got to go
and tag Rosa?

11:36.595 --> 11:37.696
Come on, Jason.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.331
I understand
you're doing your job,

11:39.398 --> 11:41.400
but try to diffuse the mess
a little bit.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.069
Why would you put
that post up?

11:43.135 --> 11:45.371
Especially the caption
was so shady.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.373
{\an5}Let's talk about it.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.373
Okay, talk about it.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.875
{\an4}You two are people
that we follow.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.875
{\an3}Right.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.110
{\an1}You were spotted
with Safaree.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.012
Yeah, I could have
friends.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.747
But friends don't give you
a big ol' bouquet of roses.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.149
But who said that he gave me
the roses, though?

11:57.216 --> 12:00.386
{\an1}And the roses were...
They were just on the table?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.221
He had already had them

12:02.288 --> 12:03.789
from when he was coming
from a prior arrangement.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.959
He got 'em from
the other Nicki.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.227
That has nothing to do
with me, Jason,

12:08.294 --> 12:10.062
so don't bring
that (bleep) up.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.597
{\an8}I can see why
it looks suspicious.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.733
{\an8}I mean, you're coming out of
a restaurant, you have flowers.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.769
Yeah, it sounds like a date.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.270
But I trust Nikki.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.839
We promised each other
to be honest,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.807
and I don't think
she'll break that.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.476
{\an1}Back in the day, when I was
hanging with different people

12:23.542 --> 12:25.111
{\an1}who wanted to be hot
that weren't hot,

12:25.177 --> 12:26.445
you take them to Katsuya,

12:26.512 --> 12:28.481
{\an1}you buy 'em a $14 roll,
and you call the paparazzi.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.082
That's what you do
to get that shot.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.417
{\an8}I know she wants
to deny this (bleep)

12:31.484 --> 12:33.119
{\an8}with Rosa sitting
next to her,

12:33.185 --> 12:36.088
{\an8}but she's the one that has
the explaining to do, not me.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.857
Everyone thinks that Safaree
is a fame whore

12:37.923 --> 12:40.059
who piggybacks
off his girl's success,

12:40.126 --> 12:42.895
so I wouldn't be surprised if he
called the paparazzi himself.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.797
{\an5}I don't think you called 'em.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.797
I would never do that.

12:44.864 --> 12:45.965
Do you think Safaree did?

12:46.031 --> 12:47.199
I don't know who called,
to be honest,

12:47.266 --> 12:48.868
{\an5}but I know it wasn't me.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.868
If it wasn't you--

12:48.934 --> 12:51.303
Okay, if it wasn't you,
then who else?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.571
I would hate for anybody
to think

12:52.638 --> 12:54.707
that somebody's using me
for publicity.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.143
I really don't like to have to
second-guess somebody's motives,

12:57.209 --> 12:58.277
but to be honest,

12:58.344 --> 12:59.678
my only concern
is how much longer

12:59.745 --> 13:01.947
I could really pull
this love triangle off.

13:02.014 --> 13:04.350
{\an1}If I didn't know you two
and it was just me writing,

13:04.416 --> 13:05.818
{\an1}I would say
they're (bleep).

13:05.885 --> 13:07.653
Well, open to
interpretation, honey.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.388
{\an1}That's what blogs
are about--

13:09.455 --> 13:11.357
{\an5}interpretation, conversation.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.357
Look, I don't care
about the blogs.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.858
I care about Rosa, and I
care about how she feels,

13:12.925 --> 13:14.593
so as long as
she feels comfortable

13:14.660 --> 13:15.995
and we clarified
all that,

13:16.061 --> 13:17.663
I don't even care
to discuss any of this.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.966
Honestly, I think he wants
people to think

13:21.033 --> 13:22.368
that he's dating Nikki.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.470
You know, Safaree needs to,
like, sit down

13:24.537 --> 13:26.772
and just get his life
together.

13:26.839 --> 13:30.276
You lose one Nicki, you can't
just get another one to replace.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.678
{\an1}You were walking out
of Katsuya with Safaree.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.747
{\an1}Of course that's a great thing
for somebody to post and say

13:34.813 --> 13:36.949
{\an1}"What's going on here?"
because publicly,

13:37.016 --> 13:40.052
{\an1}you've not come out and been
public about being together yet,

13:40.119 --> 13:41.487
{\an1}so if you're ready
to do that,

13:41.554 --> 13:43.923
{\an1}then my editors will know
not to question it,

13:43.989 --> 13:45.357
'cause right now,
they don't know.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.625
I know I'm gonna have
to make a decision

13:46.692 --> 13:49.595
about Safaree and Rosa
sooner than later.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.896
It's only a matter of time

13:50.963 --> 13:53.365
before this whole thing
blows up in my face.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.067
Tell 'em what you want.
It's your job.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.073
{\an8}We are selling this (bleep).
Sell it!

14:01.140 --> 14:03.375
Pop a wheelie on and pow!
Right there at 'em.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.810
You know what I'm saying?

14:04.877 --> 14:06.111
Then I got to hit 'em
with some mainstream looks.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.247
Hold on.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.050
I grew up watching
a lot of people make money,

14:11.116 --> 14:12.651
{\an8}but Puffy is one of the people
that I look up to.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.854
{\an8}He told me, make sure
you PR crazy, buy billboards.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.824
So, I'm putting together
a photo shoot for Scoot-E-Bike

14:18.891 --> 14:20.826
where we putting
all the billboards across L.A.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.395
I'm cornering the market.
It's like Monopoly.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.797
{\an1}Huh?

14:24.863 --> 14:25.798
How about it?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.602
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?
We got to make it...

14:29.668 --> 14:31.103
We got to make it epic.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.771
Get me, like--

14:31.170 --> 14:32.771
{\an3}Hey, babe.

14:32.838 --> 14:35.074
What's up, baby?

14:35.140 --> 14:37.276
Get me like this.

14:37.343 --> 14:38.410
Okay, I'm sorry.

14:38.477 --> 14:39.578
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

14:39.645 --> 14:41.180
{\an1}Like, I can't--
Hold on, baby, hold on.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.948
{\an1}Just let me get
my last little...

14:45.251 --> 14:46.752
All right, take a five.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.623
{\an1}Four.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.623
{\an3}Babe.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.358
{\an5}(Princess)
At the meeting
with the wedding planner,

14:52.424 --> 14:55.694
I have a lot of decisions
I have to make, like, pronto.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.796
{\an8}I can't do all of this alone,

14:57.863 --> 15:00.332
{\an8}and Ray's been so obsessed
with these Scoot-E-Bikes

15:00.399 --> 15:02.868
that he hasn't made time
to do anything with me.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.404
{\an1}I just met
with the wedding planner,

15:05.471 --> 15:08.707
and I just realized
how overwhelmed I am

15:08.774 --> 15:11.310
{\an1}because there's more
that needs to be figured out.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.078
{\an1}Like, I can't just
pick everything.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.213
I need you to help me.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.648
Let me ask you something.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.716
When you turn on
the Scoot-E-Bike, right,

15:17.783 --> 15:19.251
should it-- should it--

15:19.318 --> 15:21.186
{\an1}should it have this sound
or should it have this sound?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.456

15:24.523 --> 15:25.858

15:35.134 --> 15:36.502
{\an3}Sorry.

15:36.568 --> 15:37.503
I didn't mean
to make you mad.

15:37.569 --> 15:39.138
What you want
to do?

15:39.204 --> 15:41.573
Baby, what you
want to do?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.008
Baby, what you
want to do?

15:43.075 --> 15:44.209
{\an3}I'm sorry.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.678
What you
want to do?

15:45.744 --> 15:46.912
{\an1}I can't do this
by myself.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.347
I'm gonna do it
with you, baby.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.282
{\an3}I'm sorry.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.417
I'm sorry.

15:51.483 --> 15:52.484
(Ray)
Princess pulls up,

15:52.551 --> 15:54.286
I'm at the photo shoot,
busy,

15:54.353 --> 15:56.622
but I always got time for my
baby, but I'm still focused,

15:56.689 --> 15:58.891
and she's all stressed out
about the wedding

15:58.957 --> 16:01.960
and how things aren't coming
together like they supposed to,

16:02.027 --> 16:04.830
and now she needs my support,
and she got it.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.265
I got you, baby.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.833
What do I have to do?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.669
{\an1}I just--
I need you to be there.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.971
{\an1}Like, I need you to help me
make these decisions,

16:13.038 --> 16:16.575
{\an1}and not just now--
like, forever.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.177
{\an5}Okay, well, look at me.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.177
I need you to be involved.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.146
{\an1}I need you to promise me that
you're gonna make me a priority

16:21.213 --> 16:22.581
and our wedding a priority.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.883
You're the only priority.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.852
{\an1}If you want me to renounce
my throne with the Scoot-E-Bike,

16:26.919 --> 16:27.986
just tell me.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.588
It's not about that.
It's not about that.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.257
{\an1}I just need you
to just give me my time.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.827
I promise to be here through
this whole journey with you.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.630
I will not
let you down, okay?

16:38.697 --> 16:41.266
{\an1}While we here, why don't you
hop in this photo shoot with me?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.669
I mean, you should be
on the billboard with me.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.838
{\an1}It ain't about Scoot-E-Bike.
It's about you now.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.106
Let's go get
the photo shoot done.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.374
{\an3}All right?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.374

come by

18:39.618 --> 18:41.954
so they could finally meet
Miss Rosa Acosta.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.989
Since they know about
this crazy love triangle

18:44.056 --> 18:45.524
I've gotten myself into,

18:45.591 --> 18:49.661
I trust them both not to say
anything about Safaree to Rosa.

and find out
where we are going,

'cause right now,
I'm lost.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.338
No matter how hot
the guys think it is

19:33.405 --> 19:35.073
that Nikki's dating Rosa,

19:35.140 --> 19:37.109
if that's going on
behind my back,

19:37.175 --> 19:38.544
that's betrayal.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.712
I saw on the 'gram that she has
an event coming up.

hold him hostage here or..."

involved, honestly.

but to come clean.

20:30.929 --> 20:33.465
Well, moment of truth, guys.

20:33.532 --> 20:34.866

there was any

{\an1}other type of side
fishy business going on,

20:37.235 --> 20:38.670

This is not
fishy business.

20:40.872 --> 20:42.908
{\an1}If I don't know about it,
it's fishy business.

20:42.975 --> 20:43.909

20:45.544 --> 20:48.447
I-- I have not been
totally honest.

I have been seeing
both of you.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.819

I just can't believe that Nikki
actually lied to me.

20:53.885 --> 20:56.355
We agreed that
we were gonna be honest.

what's going on right now.

{\an1}Y'all, like, in
a full-blown relationship,

21:00.926 --> 21:03.795
{\an1}or you just dip on
some ball game vibes?

21:03.862 --> 21:05.130
{\an3}Some what?

21:05.197 --> 21:07.299
I've been intimate
with her and I...

{\an1}What's intimate mean

what intimate means.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.570

Mm. (chuckles)

21:16.308 --> 21:17.409
{\an3}What?

21:17.476 --> 21:18.677
{\an1}Mm, okay.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.380
I just don't understand
why you care so much

21:21.446 --> 21:22.881
if she's not
your girlfriend.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.616
{\an1}You don't know what
me and her have been doing.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.785
Honey, you guys are not
building a goddamn thing.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.820
{\an1}You living, like,
a double life right now.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.856
{\an1}Why are you so upset?
We're not in a relationship.

21:30.922 --> 21:33.458
{\an1}You tell me that you're not
dealing with anyone else.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.559
Another man.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.561
{\an1}Come on,
that's very deceiving.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.996
But she doesn't have to be
explaining you

21:38.063 --> 21:39.197
a goddamn thing anyways.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.700
When I first met Nikki,
I fell for her.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.336
Aside from her being
beautiful and a boss,

21:44.403 --> 21:45.837
I feel like we got
a connection.

21:45.904 --> 21:46.972
I made it clear
from the jump

21:47.039 --> 21:49.107
I wasn't gonna be
seeing anybody,

21:49.174 --> 21:50.509
and she said
the same exact thing,

21:50.575 --> 21:51.943
and then
if that was to change,

21:52.010 --> 21:53.445
we were gonna let each other
know.

21:53.512 --> 21:54.646
{\an1}This is what
I want to know,

21:54.713 --> 21:56.348
{\an1}'cause she's acting, like,
feisty right now.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.818
I want whatever you have.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.654
I want the both of y'all.

22:05.323 --> 22:06.658
{\an8}Coming up...

22:06.725 --> 22:08.827
{\an8}I'm still figuring out
it is-- what we are, even.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.162
{\an7}You're like, we're just hanging
out, we're just hanging out.

22:10.228 --> 22:11.730
{\an8}Okay, if we're
just hanging out,

22:11.797 --> 22:13.999
{\an7}do I owe anybody
a mother(bleep) explanation?

22:14.066 --> 22:16.468
{\an8}What does Willie expect me
to do in this situation?

22:16.535 --> 22:17.736
{\an7}I don't know what
I expect you to do.

22:17.803 --> 22:20.172
{\an7}I just know I don't want you
to leave me, though.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.047
{\an1}(Safaree)
I want whatever you have.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.818
{\an5}I want the both of y'all.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.818
What do you think this is?

22:32.884 --> 22:35.020
{\an7}Walking in here trying to say,
"Hey, can I (bleep) too?"

22:35.087 --> 22:36.788
{\an1}That's not cool.
You're not that type of guy.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.090
So, don't come
in here on that.

22:38.156 --> 22:39.624
{\an5}That's what you're doing.

22:38.156 --> 22:39.624
{\an3}No one's--

22:39.691 --> 22:40.826
{\an7}You're just doing it
separately.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.094
{\an8}What I share with her

22:42.160 --> 22:43.729
is different than what
I share with you.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.064
Nikki's sitting there
trying to be mad at me,

22:46.131 --> 22:47.466
{\an8}and I'm the one
who walked in

22:47.532 --> 22:49.267
{\an8}and caught her kissing
another chick.

22:49.334 --> 22:50.635
{\an8}I don't work like that.

22:52.437 --> 22:53.772
Bro, I'm waiting
for you to leave.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.640
Like, you taking
forever to leave.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.175
I'm gonna leave.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.144
Y'all two are gonna be able
to have this couch and do...

22:59.211 --> 23:01.613
{\an5}Oh, we will.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.613
{\an1}...whatever y'all want
to do to each other.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.948
{\an1}But don't think
that when I leave this,

23:03.014 --> 23:05.951
{\an1}I'm never gonna speak to her
or see her again.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.257
{\an5}(Nikki)
Of course I feel bad
for lying to them both

23:12.324 --> 23:13.625
and not being
totally honest.

23:13.692 --> 23:16.328
My plan was never
to hurt their feelings,

23:16.394 --> 23:18.563
and that's exactly
what I just did.

23:18.630 --> 23:21.500
But right now, there's honestly
nothing I can say at this moment

23:21.566 --> 23:24.336
to make either one of them
feel better about the situation.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.504
What I'm not gonna do

23:25.570 --> 23:28.473
{\an1}is fight for your attention
and your love

23:28.540 --> 23:29.541
with somebody like him.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.742
You know what I mean?

23:30.809 --> 23:32.277
You need to open your eyes,

23:32.344 --> 23:35.046
'cause a lot of people hang out
with you for the wrong reasons.

23:35.113 --> 23:38.116
There's qualities that he has
that I really do appreciate,

23:38.183 --> 23:40.085
{\an1}and even if you don't see it,
I'm telling you.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.587
{\an5}Okay, girl.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.587
{\an1}And there are things
that I feel with you that--

23:42.654 --> 23:45.023
You know, it-- it's all--
it's separate.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.324
This is some bull(bleep).

23:46.391 --> 23:48.393
If you want to date
a loser now, well,

23:48.460 --> 23:49.594
{\an1}go ahead, girl,
like, do it.

23:49.661 --> 23:50.862
But it's just, like,

23:50.929 --> 23:52.664
{\an1}I'm not gonna put myself
in a position

23:52.731 --> 23:55.700
{\an1}where I have to even, like,
let this guy stare at me,

23:55.767 --> 23:57.169
like, up and down.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.204
I'm not telling you to put
yourself in the position.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.605
No, but you already did.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.440
I'm still figuring out
it is-- what we are, even.

24:02.507 --> 24:03.842
Even with me and you,
you're like,

24:03.909 --> 24:05.076
we're just hanging out,
we're just hanging out.

24:05.143 --> 24:06.645
Okay, if we're just
hanging out,

24:06.711 --> 24:09.614
{\an1}do I owe anybody
a mother(bleep) explanation?

24:09.681 --> 24:10.749
That's exactly
what I thought,

24:10.816 --> 24:13.084
{\an1}but then I have to
hear it from Safaree.

24:13.151 --> 24:14.619
{\an1}I didn't expect him to walk
in here and do all that.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.588
{\an1}Okay, but it was gonna
happen eventually.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.557
Rosa, I'm not one
of those people

24:18.623 --> 24:20.192
who can build lies
on lies on lies,

24:20.258 --> 24:22.194
so I was really gonna tell you,
like, this week, I really was.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.329
Oh, you are.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.329
No, I'm not.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.964
{\an1}I was waiting
for the moment to tell you.

24:26.031 --> 24:27.199
{\an1}All right.

24:26.031 --> 24:27.199
I do feel bad.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.934
{\an1}This is what happens
when you wait.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.916
When I first got the letter,
I knew that my wife was serious

24:44.983 --> 24:47.552
and she was gonna leave
if she didn't get the truth.

24:47.619 --> 24:48.887
I know that that's not
gonna save me,

24:48.954 --> 24:50.055
{\an8}'cause I know
it's still a possibility

24:50.121 --> 24:51.656
{\an8}that my wife
could just still leave.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.291
{\an8}Whatever happens,
I'm gonna have to deal with it,

24:53.358 --> 24:55.627
{\an8}and that's tough,
that's real tough.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.562
And I definitely
don't want to lose my family.

Right now, something
has to give.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.410
Like, I don't even want to be
around Will at this point.

25:12.477 --> 25:14.880
{\an8}Like, being around you
just disgusts me at this point

25:14.946 --> 25:16.848
{\an8}because you're just
that (bleep) dumb

25:16.915 --> 25:19.050
{\an8}to the point where you allow
that (bleep) to (bleep) with me,

25:19.117 --> 25:21.086
and I don't feel like
you're respecting me enough,

25:21.152 --> 25:22.387
so now I don't even want
to be around you.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.422
I need a break.
I need a moment to myself

25:24.489 --> 25:26.091
to see what
I really want to do,

25:26.157 --> 25:27.692
because obviously
you didn't care enough

25:27.759 --> 25:28.994
to protect your home.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.362
I got your letter.

25:30.428 --> 25:34.065
{\an1}It said you want to step away
from your marriage.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.001
I know that you haven't
been 100 with me.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.303
{\an1}Tell me the truth
so that I can move forward.

{\an1}I'm here to tell you
the truth.

I knew that, right?

25:50.749 --> 25:52.350
You know I knew
that, right?

25:52.417 --> 25:53.818
Yeah, I know.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.153
All this time
I've been sitting here

25:55.220 --> 25:58.990
waiting for you to (bleep)
tell me the truth.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.892
I already knew
what you had done,

26:00.959 --> 26:02.227
but you kept lying
about the situation.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.495
{\an1}I'm so sorry, man.
That was just it, though.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.463
{\an1}So, at this point,
what do you expect me to do?

26:05.530 --> 26:07.599
{\an1}I don't know what
I expect you to do.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.734

really hurt me.

from the bottom of my heart
that I love you.

I believe the whole union is,
you know, it's in jeopardy.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.480
You cheated
and I can't trust you.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.115
You're untrustworthy.

in this (bleep) violent way.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.021
That's (bleep) up.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.823
Because you know how hard
I've been trying

26:31.890 --> 26:35.961
to just make this perfect,
like, mom for my children.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.495
I don't want them to think
that this is okay.

26:37.562 --> 26:39.297
{\an5}Yeah, I know.

26:39.364 --> 26:40.966
look at this (bleep)

26:41.032 --> 26:42.968
{\an1}like, damn, why the (bleep)
did I act like that?

26:43.034 --> 26:46.738
I'm fighting for something
I already have?

26:46.805 --> 26:49.507
I'm not gonna fight
no bitch for nobody.

26:49.574 --> 26:50.909
I shouldn't have to
in this situation.

Well, at this point,
I'm just going to--

26:58.550 --> 27:01.386
I'm still gonna have to
step back, Willie.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.422
I just need
to seriously see,

Well, I think you should
talk to him about that.

28:51.696 --> 28:52.897
{\an6}Yeah.

28:51.696 --> 28:52.897
You know what I mean?

28:52.964 --> 28:54.966
{\an1}'Cause I do think it's
a really important moment.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.102
{\an1}I think every woman
waits for it, you know,

28:57.168 --> 28:58.503
{\an1}and wants her dad
to be there,

28:58.570 --> 29:01.973
{\an1}but I think if there
is some stuff between you,

29:02.040 --> 29:03.374
you should resolve that.

29:03.441 --> 29:05.009
But just because I have
a conversation with him

29:05.076 --> 29:06.744
now that I'm
already an adult,

29:06.811 --> 29:08.680
that doesn't mean
it's gonna fix everything.

29:08.746 --> 29:10.048
{\an1}I mean, not to be
too personal,

29:10.115 --> 29:11.816
{\an1}or not to get too much
in your business,

29:11.883 --> 29:14.252
{\an1}but your relationship
with your dad

29:14.319 --> 29:16.588
{\an4}dictates your relationship
with Ray.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.588
{\an3}Really?

29:16.654 --> 29:18.723
{\an1}Because he's the first man
you ever loved.

29:21.326 --> 29:23.061
{\an1}And he's the first man
that ever loved you,

29:23.128 --> 29:25.730
{\an1}and he's the first man
who ever didn't love you,

29:25.797 --> 29:28.466
{\an1}so it's really
important.

29:28.533 --> 29:32.704
You-- Oh, I'm sorry.

29:32.770 --> 29:34.973
{\an1}I don't mean
to make you sad.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.508
{\an1}I don't.

29:36.574 --> 29:38.776
{\an3}It's okay.

29:38.843 --> 29:41.246
I don't have a relationship
with my dad,

29:41.312 --> 29:43.781
and Ray not being here
for me

29:43.848 --> 29:47.385
does kind of stir up
those abandonment issues.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.555
I don't always feel
like I can count on my dad,

29:50.622 --> 29:51.956
and I don't want
to start feeling like that

29:52.023 --> 29:53.224
about my husband.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.793
I just always acted like
I didn't care, you know?

29:55.860 --> 29:57.662
{\an1}I know.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.297
It's just...

29:59.364 --> 30:02.033
It's crazy that I've never had
this conversation with anybody.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.835
You haven't?

30:03.902 --> 30:06.371
{\an1}The difficult conversation,
it will help you.

30:06.437 --> 30:09.274
{\an1}I know it will.
So, you have to do that.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.075
I just don't think
that that conversation

30:11.142 --> 30:13.244
would fix everything,
you know?

30:13.311 --> 30:15.413
It doesn't fix everything,
but you know what it does

30:15.480 --> 30:17.182
{\an1}is it starts
the healing process.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.349
{\an3}Yeah.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.852
{\an1}But I do think
you have to deal with that.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.487
Before you get married.

30:23.821 --> 30:25.190
So, I have, like,
a couple weeks?

30:25.256 --> 30:26.191
Two months.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.359
(laughter)

30:28.426 --> 30:30.328
Yeah. All right?

30:28.426 --> 30:30.328
{\an3}Yeah.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.329
{\an1}Okay.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.329
{\an3}Yeah.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.431
{\an1}Sorry. Didn't mean
to go there.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.700
{\an5}So, what about
that cake?

30:33.498 --> 30:35.700
{\an1}Yes.

30:35.767 --> 30:36.801
So, what about Ray?

30:36.868 --> 30:37.969
{\an1}You think
he's coming or...

30:38.036 --> 30:40.705
Should we wait
a little bit?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.574
{\an3}No.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.574
{\an1}All right.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.841
Ready to try it.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.841
{\an3}Yeah.

30:43.908 --> 30:44.842
{\an1}Okay.
You hold tight.

30:44.909 --> 30:46.477
{\an3}Okay.

30:44.909 --> 30:46.477
I'll be right back.

30:50.815 --> 30:53.084
{\an5}(woman, recorded)

31:36.427 --> 31:37.929
You wrote that
while you were pregnant?

31:37.996 --> 31:39.797
{\an1}Yeah. I was going
through a lot,

31:39.864 --> 31:42.500
{\an1}but I feel like where
I am now and where I was then

31:42.567 --> 31:43.768
{\an1}is two different
things.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.671
So, I would love for us
to create something new,

31:46.738 --> 31:47.839
kind of progressive,

31:47.905 --> 31:50.775
{\an1}like, from my own to now,
where I am now.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.243
{\an8}So, we're gonna kick it
in fifth gear

31:52.310 --> 31:54.912
{\an8}and do something
for this project ASAP.

31:54.979 --> 31:56.114
{\an5}That sounds good.

31:54.979 --> 31:56.114
{\an3}Okay, cool.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.448
That sounds good.
That's what's up.

31:58.916 --> 32:00.718
Max is still furious with me

32:00.785 --> 32:03.354
for using our son's money
to open the store,

32:03.421 --> 32:05.423
{\an8}but I think today
is gonna be the day

32:05.490 --> 32:09.327
{\an8}I finally get him to forgive me
and come on back home.

32:09.394 --> 32:14.365
I'm gonna surprise my baby
with a nice big box of cash.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.601
The more I figure out
who I am as an artist,

32:16.668 --> 32:18.903
{\an1}like, the easier it is for me
to, like, express myself.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.672
{\an5}It used to be...

32:18.970 --> 32:20.672
Hey, babe.

32:21.873 --> 32:22.807
{\an6}Surprise.

32:21.873 --> 32:22.807
{\an1}Hello.

32:22.874 --> 32:23.975
{\an5}What's up, girl?

32:22.874 --> 32:23.975
Hello.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.743
What's going on here?

32:25.810 --> 32:29.180
Max mentioned he had
a studio session today,

32:29.247 --> 32:34.152
but what I don't understand is,
what is Masika doing here?

32:34.218 --> 32:36.187
The last time
they worked together,

32:36.254 --> 32:40.091
she did some very shady stuff
to my friend,

32:40.158 --> 32:42.894
and Max knows all about it.

32:42.960 --> 32:47.031
{\an1}Excuse me, you know, for being
a little miscombobulated,

32:47.098 --> 32:49.634
{\an1}but I'm trying to understand
what the (bleep) this is.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.069
A session.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.771
So, when did you started
working with her again?

32:53.838 --> 32:56.341
We just started
working right now.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.042
{\an1}But you failed to (bleep)
tell me about it?

32:58.109 --> 32:59.544
Okay, I don't--
I don't know

32:59.610 --> 33:01.446
what you guys have going on,
and I don't want to know.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.181
{\an5}It's not my business.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.181
{\an3}Really?

33:03.247 --> 33:04.615
{\an5}But whatever it is...

33:03.247 --> 33:04.615
Failed to tell?

33:04.682 --> 33:06.217
You say those
words to me?

33:06.284 --> 33:08.119
{\an1}I get it, and I'm wrong
for my part.

33:08.186 --> 33:10.088
But if you did get it,
you wouldn't be in here

33:10.154 --> 33:11.522
running your mouth
like that.

33:11.589 --> 33:12.724
At the end of the day...

33:12.790 --> 33:13.925
Are you serious
right now?

33:13.991 --> 33:16.127
{\an1}Am I serious?
Because Jamila--

33:16.194 --> 33:17.662
{\an1}The last time
this situation happened,

33:17.729 --> 33:18.996
{\an1}you know
my business partner

33:19.063 --> 33:21.232
and my mother(bleep)
best friend, Jamila,

33:21.299 --> 33:22.700
{\an1}and you know all what
was said and told to me.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.068
Why are you yelling
in my session?

33:24.135 --> 33:26.537
{\an1}'Cause don't you dare,
don't you dare

33:26.604 --> 33:29.273
{\an1}act like you don't know
why I'm confused right now.

33:29.340 --> 33:34.379
No way in hell is Max gonna work
with this no-talented ho.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.881
She tried to (bleep)
my best friend's husband

33:36.948 --> 33:38.750
to get some tracks,

33:38.816 --> 33:42.620
and although I trust Max,
I don't trust her.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.955
I'm just a little
confused here,

33:44.021 --> 33:46.023
because I've never been
in a session working

33:46.090 --> 33:47.125
and this has happened.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.459
Whatever y'all have
going on,

33:48.526 --> 33:49.460
that's your business.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.762
I have nothing to do
with it,

33:50.828 --> 33:52.196
nor do I want to have
anything to do with it.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.699
Well, what I was
previously told

33:54.766 --> 33:57.001
{\an1}a couple years ago
from my best friend,

33:57.068 --> 33:58.736
{\an1}who is also
my business partner,

33:58.803 --> 34:00.872
{\an1}that you were trying
to sleep with her man.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.306
{\an5}(chuckling)
Oh. Oh, you're talking
about the guy

34:02.373 --> 34:03.841
that tried to sleep with me

34:03.908 --> 34:05.877
but I wouldn't even talk to him
or give him the time of day?

34:05.943 --> 34:07.345
{\an4}Well--

34:05.943 --> 34:07.345
You're talking
about that guy,

34:07.412 --> 34:09.080
who I still have
all his text messages?

34:09.147 --> 34:10.415
{\an1}I saw the messages
that my best friend showed me.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.716
{\an5}No, you did not.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.716
She did show me.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.551
Honey, 'cause I still have
my phone.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.320
So, we're just working
on a new record.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.855
So, whatever y'all have,

34:17.922 --> 34:19.424
I don't want to be involved
in that.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.125
The truth of the matter is,

34:21.192 --> 34:23.561
this loser producer said he
didn't want to work with me

34:23.628 --> 34:25.663
unless I gave him
something in return,

34:25.730 --> 34:28.666
and I refuse to work with him
ever again.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.699
{\an5}This is mess.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.699
What is mess?

34:29.766 --> 34:31.101
Busting up in a session

34:31.168 --> 34:32.837
trying to ask him what's
going on when we're working.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.205
{\an1}This is my
husband's session.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.340
{\an1}If I say there's no session,
there will be no session.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.809
{\an5}That's not true.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.809
{\an1}Oh, it's very
mother(bleep) true.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.710
{\an5}You didn't pay
for this session.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.710
Listen, Masika.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.344
{\an6}Sit down.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.344
{\an1}No, I don't need
to sit down.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.414
{\an5}Yes, you do.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.414
{\an1}I don't (bleep)
condone bull(bleep)

34:43.481 --> 34:44.982
{\an5}and mother(bleep)...

34:43.481 --> 34:44.982
Your-- Your--

34:45.049 --> 34:47.618
{\an1}So you better put people in they
mother(bleep) place right now.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.187
{\an1}Did you hear
what she said?

34:49.253 --> 34:51.556
B is completely out of line.

34:51.621 --> 34:52.924
Me and Masika just working,

34:52.989 --> 34:55.092
and whether or not
she smashed her homey or not

34:55.159 --> 34:56.726
has nothing to do with me.

34:56.793 --> 34:59.997
If anything, B should be happy
I'm working as hard as possible

35:00.064 --> 35:02.733
to fix her mistake
and replace that money.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.204
I don't like when people are
married and in relationships

35:06.270 --> 35:07.605
{\an1}and these
mother(bleep) Beckys,

35:07.672 --> 35:10.908
{\an1}like my girl Beyoncé makes it
very mother(bleep) clear.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.811
{\an5}She ain't your girl.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.811
{\an1}Oh, she's my (bleep)
since day one.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.112
{\an5}Okay, well, call her now.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.112
You better--

35:15.179 --> 35:16.214
{\an1}You better do
your track record...

35:16.280 --> 35:17.882
I'm so embarrassed.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.418
I had no idea
that Brandi was best friends

35:20.485 --> 35:21.819
with the Queen Bey.

35:21.886 --> 35:24.255
I mean, this whole time,

35:24.322 --> 35:25.990
I'm sitting here wondering
why this girl is crazy,

35:26.057 --> 35:28.125
and I just need to get
in formation with her and B.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.561
Like, call Beyoncé, girl!

35:30.628 --> 35:33.464
Yoncé! Where you at?

35:33.531 --> 35:34.632
{\an5}Get her out my face.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.632
No, I don't (bleep).

35:34.699 --> 35:35.933
Get her out of my face.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.568
Get her out of my face.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.704
Can someone get this girl
out of my face?

35:39.770 --> 35:40.838
{\an1}...(bleep) session
means nothing

35:40.905 --> 35:42.206
{\an4}and that you have
the last say.

35:40.905 --> 35:42.206
Yo.

35:42.273 --> 35:43.374
{\an1}No.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.510
(bleep) Get this bitch
out of here.

35:45.576 --> 35:48.412
{\an5}...calling me a bitch?

35:45.576 --> 35:48.412
Yeah, girl, you (bleep)...

35:48.479 --> 35:51.082
I'm about ready
to lose it right now.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.851
Nobody messes
with Brandi Boyd, bitch,

35:53.918 --> 35:56.187
and nobody (bleep)
with my friends.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.189
{\an5}Max, put your dog
on a leash.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.189
Yo, this conversation...

35:58.256 --> 35:59.824
(Bleep) joke.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.492
{\an1}And you best stop talking
(bleep), little girl.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.027
And a new mother--

36:03.094 --> 36:05.162
{\an1}'Cause a new mother don't got
the right to disrespect me.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.731
{\an1}That new mother can get
the (bleep) beat out of her

36:06.797 --> 36:07.899
talking (bleep) to me.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.033
Bitch, get the (bleep)
out of here.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.102
Go (bleep) yourself.

36:11.168 --> 36:12.637
{\an8}Coming up...

36:12.703 --> 36:15.907
{\an8}Two, four, six,
eight, ten,

36:15.973 --> 36:18.342
{\an8}eleven, twelve,
thirteen.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.877
{\an8}Here's 15,000 of it,

36:19.944 --> 36:21.779
{\an7}and you let that little bitch
talk (bleep) to your wife.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.582
{\an7}You're yelling
in my ear.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.351
{\an7}Your volume is still,
like, on ten in my ear.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.351
{\an5}You don't respect
that I'm working hard?

36:27.418 --> 36:29.253
{\an7}No.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.253
{\an8}That's 15,000 of it.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.521
{\an8}No, I don't.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.265
{\an7}This little bitch done lost
her mother(bleep) mind.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.733
{\an1}And you act like
you don't got to put

36:42.800 --> 36:45.036
{\an4}that little bitch
in check.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.036
{\an3}You done?

36:45.102 --> 36:47.972
{\an8}I cannot believe
Max stood there

36:48.039 --> 36:51.576
{\an8}and let that bum bitch
disrespect me like that.

36:51.642 --> 36:53.945
My husband
always has my back.

36:54.011 --> 36:57.915
That means when a wack-ass bitch
calls me out my name,

36:57.982 --> 36:59.450
don't let nothing slide.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.152
{\an1}That right there
is a problem.

37:01.218 --> 37:03.888
{\an1}That disrespectful little bitch
trying to use you to come up.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.356
{\an1}She want a hit record
from you?

37:05.423 --> 37:06.524
{\an1}Bitch, you're not
real talent.

37:06.591 --> 37:08.626
{\an1}(bleep) real
(bleep) stars.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.027
{\an5}Real boss--

37:08.693 --> 37:10.027
Who you talking to?

37:10.094 --> 37:11.395
You looking at the floor,
or you looking at me?

37:11.462 --> 37:12.797
{\an1}I'm talking to this bitch
that just walked out of here

37:12.863 --> 37:15.032
{\an1}and disrespected me,
and you let her disrespect me.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.801
{\an5}All right,
so check this out.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.801
{\an1}You're my husband,
and I'm your wife, right?

37:16.867 --> 37:17.835
I'm not
your nothing.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.503
Oh, oh, you're not?

37:17.902 --> 37:19.503
{\an3}No.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.405
{\an5}I'm nothing to you?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.405
{\an1}You done?

37:21.472 --> 37:24.742
Two, four, six,
eight, ten,

37:24.809 --> 37:27.111
eleven, twelve,
thirteen.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.579
{\an1}You know how much the studio
cost to rent today?

37:28.646 --> 37:29.947
No, let me explain to you.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.382
I respected your money,
and I put back 15,000.

37:31.449 --> 37:33.050
{\an1}You didn't respect
my money.

37:33.117 --> 37:34.785
{\an5}And I been working for it.

37:33.117 --> 37:34.785
{\an1}And running everybody
up out of here.

37:34.852 --> 37:37.088
Working really hard
to put back my son's money

37:37.154 --> 37:38.389
from the store,
and I'm showing you,

37:38.456 --> 37:40.524
{\an5}Here's 15,000 of it.

37:38.456 --> 37:40.524
You're not showing me nothing.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.026
And you let this
little (bleep) clown,

37:42.093 --> 37:44.295
Bozo the clown, Becky bitch
talk (bleep) to your wife.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.964
You're yelling in my ear.

37:47.031 --> 37:48.332
{\an1}Your volume is still,
like, on ten in my ear.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.101
You don't respect
that I'm working hard

37:50.167 --> 37:51.235
to pay the money back
to show you

37:51.302 --> 37:53.270
that I respect
our son's savings?

37:53.337 --> 37:55.106
{\an1}No.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.106
That is 15,000 of it.

37:55.172 --> 37:56.674
Nah, I don't.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.110
Even though B is coming back
with some of the bread,

37:59.176 --> 38:00.244
{\an8}it's too late,

38:00.311 --> 38:02.413
{\an8}because it never
was about the money.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.248
You lied to me
and broke my trust,

38:04.315 --> 38:06.050
and now it's gonna be
even harder

38:06.117 --> 38:07.318
to get back cool with me

38:07.385 --> 38:09.453
after busting in
another session.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.988
This is a place of business,

38:11.055 --> 38:12.089
and her coming in here

38:12.156 --> 38:14.091
ambushing clients
is unacceptable,

38:14.158 --> 38:16.060
no matter what they did.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.128
You embarrassed me.

38:17.194 --> 38:18.763
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about her.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.565
{\an1}You got it made up
in your mind

38:21.632 --> 38:23.267
{\an1}that you right
and the whole world is wrong,

38:23.334 --> 38:24.669
so whatever.

38:24.735 --> 38:27.338
Then why am I up here trying
to gain your (bleep) respect

38:27.405 --> 38:28.572
and do whatever it takes?

38:28.639 --> 38:30.975
{\an1}Can't nobody
on this planet

38:31.042 --> 38:32.410
walk through
those doors

38:32.476 --> 38:33.811
{\an1}while I'm paying
for the studio

38:33.878 --> 38:35.079
and tell me what to do

38:35.146 --> 38:37.548
{\an1}and yell in my face
and shut down my session.

38:37.615 --> 38:38.549
So, I don't respect
your money?

38:38.616 --> 38:40.184
{\an1}You don't respect
my nothing.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.519
{\an1}And it's about
what I want.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.254
And what did I do so wrong
to you right now?

38:43.320 --> 38:44.422
{\an1}You don't even know,
do you?

38:44.488 --> 38:45.656
You think I'm just
supposed to let somebody

38:45.723 --> 38:47.892
punk me and talk (bleep)
out of her...

38:47.958 --> 38:49.293
What is this?
What is that?

38:49.360 --> 38:50.561
{\an1}I'm out.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.163
{\an1}I don't want to talk
about this (bleep) no more.

38:52.229 --> 38:55.399
{\an1}Another session successfully
shut down by Lil B.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.001
Congratulations.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.945
{\an8}Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

39:08.012 --> 39:09.080
{\an7}Where are you
with everything?

39:09.146 --> 39:10.414
{\an8}I don't want to
hang out with Nikki.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.149
{\an7}I don't want to see her.
I don't want to talk to her.

39:12.216 --> 39:13.684
{\an8}All this happening
right before

39:13.751 --> 39:15.586
{\an8}we're supposed to do
the pop-up show.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.289
{\an8}What are you gonna do?

39:15.653 --> 39:18.289
{\an8}I'm not gonna stop my business

39:18.355 --> 39:20.991
{\an8}just because Nikki
did something stupid.

39:21.058 --> 39:23.294
{\an8}Awkward. This is
my friend Carter.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.429
{\an7}I guess you're my upgrade.
Or my replacement.

39:25.496 --> 39:26.897
{\an8}She doesn't lie, though.

39:25.496 --> 39:26.897
{\an7}Rosa...

39:26.964 --> 39:28.232
{\an7}me and you (bleep) around,
you know that.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.934
{\an7}You know what type
of bitch I am.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.936
{\an8}I can't hear your apology.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.170
{\an7}You're not gonna get
no more apologies

39:33.237 --> 39:34.939
{\an7}out of my mouth,
promise.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.508
{\an8}If you were in a room with
a bunch of industry people

39:37.575 --> 39:39.343
{\an8}and my name was brought up,

39:39.410 --> 39:40.745
{\an7}what would
the conversation be?

39:40.811 --> 39:42.480
{\an8}People would say,
why is she on this blog?

39:42.546 --> 39:43.814
{\an8}Why is she acting crazy?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.416
{\an8}That's not who I am.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.151
{\an8}So, what kind of charges
is he trying to press?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.320
{\an8}For doing what?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.320
{\an8}Well, petty theft.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.489
{\an8}You have to go to court?
Or what's going on now?

39:51.555 --> 39:52.823
{\an7}They offered me
a plea deal.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.458
{\an8}I'm not gonna do that.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.727
{\an7}I didn't do anything,
and now I'm going to trial.

39:56.794 --> 39:57.928
{\an8}Are you serious?

39:57.995 --> 40:00.698
{\an7}I could be in jail
for 30 days to six months.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.500
{\an7}Why you can't believe
in my dream?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.235
{\an8}You can't do anything
that I ask you to do,

40:04.301 --> 40:05.503
{\an8}and it's
pissing me off.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.238
{\an8}If you're not into
planning the wedding,

40:07.304 --> 40:08.672
{\an8}why not get married now?

40:08.739 --> 40:10.574
{\an8}We could issue the marriage
license on the spot.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.409
{\an7}Cut the bull(bleep).
I'm gonna make it work.

40:12.476 --> 40:14.478
{\an8}You want me to be 50%?

40:12.476 --> 40:14.478
{\an9}Yes.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.381
{\an8}You about to get 5,000%.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.316
{\an8}(A1)
Welcome to your new home,
Miss Bentley.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.619
{\an7}I think we should do,
like, a housewarming party.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.220
{\an8}I have an idea.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.220
{\an9}What?

40:23.287 --> 40:25.256
{\an7}We'll make people think
it's a housewarming party,

40:25.322 --> 40:26.957
{\an7}but it'd really be
a reception.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.827
{\an7}Maybe my mom
will be, like,

40:29.894 --> 40:31.595
{\an7}not so comfortable
to get so mad

40:31.662 --> 40:33.798
{\an7}when we tell her the news
in front of everybody.

40:33.864 --> 40:36.433
{\an7}This is not just
a housewarming party.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.736
{\an7}This is our
wedding reception.

40:38.803 --> 40:41.138
{\an8}(guests cheering)

40:41.205 --> 40:43.440
{\an8}You probably mad
'cause they got married.

40:43.507 --> 40:44.675
{\an8}I'm gonna be straight up.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.711
{\an7}You feel how the (bleep)
you want to feel, Pam,

40:47.778 --> 40:49.313
{\an7}but don't tell me
how to feel!
