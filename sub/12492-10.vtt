00:18.143 --> 00:20.023
- Mom.
- What?

00:20.023 --> 00:22.503
What are you doing?

00:22.503 --> 00:24.903
Squeezing in my cardio,
working up a sweat.

00:24.903 --> 00:29.463
Okay. Well, can you
sweat on P.J.'s sandwich?

00:29.503 --> 00:31.903
Gotta feel the burn.

00:31.903 --> 00:35.423
Gotta buy my lunch!

00:35.423 --> 00:38.183
Hey, honey.
Honey!

00:38.183 --> 00:41.023
- What?
- I'm leaving for work.

00:41.023 --> 00:43.383
- Give me a kiss.
- Catch me if you can.

00:43.383 --> 00:45.783
I've kissed
you enough already.

00:45.783 --> 00:47.783
Wow, I guess
it's true:

00:47.783 --> 00:50.383
Breakfast is the most
disturbing meal of the day.

00:51.863 --> 00:53.943
Wait. Whoa whoa whoa.
Bob, wait.

00:53.943 --> 00:55.503
I forgot
to tell you something.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.543
It's about your
Uncle Mel... he called.

00:57.543 --> 00:59.383
I don't wanna hear it.

00:59.383 --> 01:01.743
Oh, come on! He begged me
to pass on the message.

01:01.743 --> 01:05.102
Thank you, and now I'm
going to pass on the message.

01:05.102 --> 01:08.263
- Who's Uncle Mel?
- Somebody you'll never know.

01:08.263 --> 01:09.983
He's your father's uncle.

01:09.983 --> 01:12.383
Okay, so you told me
about Uncle Stanley

01:12.383 --> 01:15.103
Who knits sweaters
for his cats,

01:15.103 --> 01:16.903
But you didn't want
to tell me about Uncle Mel?

01:16.903 --> 01:18.743
Because, Teddy,
if you don't have

01:18.743 --> 01:20.503
Anything nice
to say about someone,

01:20.503 --> 01:22.423
Then don't say
anything at all.

01:22.423 --> 01:24.103
And Mel's an idiot.

01:25.943 --> 01:28.703
Okay, mom, tell me about Uncle Mel.

01:28.703 --> 01:30.543
Well, he and your father had

01:30.543 --> 01:32.383
Some kind of falling out.
That's all I know.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.303
Isn't there some way
we can find out more?

01:34.303 --> 01:37.303
This is the first interesting
thing about dad since...

01:37.303 --> 01:40.063
Well, this is the first
interesting thing about dad.

01:41.423 --> 01:43.303
Honey, trust me.
I've learned the hard way:

01:43.303 --> 01:45.343
When it comes
to Duncan family drama,

01:45.343 --> 01:47.743
- Stay out.
- Are there any other

01:47.743 --> 01:49.663
Surprise relatives
you want to tell me about?

01:49.663 --> 01:50.983
No.

01:50.983 --> 01:52.623
No.

02:38.983 --> 02:43.983

02:51.943 --> 02:54.503
Great news, mom.
I like Charlie now.

02:54.503 --> 02:56.543
Well, finally.
What happened?

02:56.543 --> 02:58.743
We were in the park
and this photographer

02:58.743 --> 03:00.663
Thought that Charlie was
the cutest baby ever.

03:00.663 --> 03:03.863
He offered to pay her 100
dollars to use her as a model.

03:03.863 --> 03:06.143
Who knew? She's actually
good for something

03:06.143 --> 03:08.623
Besides drooling
and pooping.

03:09.743 --> 03:11.983
"Walter Louper
photography.

03:12.023 --> 03:15.463
Specializing in dogs,
cats and babies."

03:15.463 --> 03:17.743
Forget it. I'm not
exploiting my baby.

03:17.743 --> 03:21.143
But we don't have
a dog or a cat.

03:21.143 --> 03:23.463
Mom, come on.

03:23.463 --> 03:25.183
This could be
a big break for Charlie.

03:25.183 --> 03:28.143
P.J., Charlie is not getting
a job before you do.

03:28.143 --> 03:32.543
Well, the photographer
didn't offer to shoot me.

03:32.543 --> 03:35.743
Ha. You don't have
to have a modeling job.

03:35.743 --> 03:38.183
Any job will do.
Come here.

03:38.183 --> 03:41.223
Man, this conversation
sure took an ugly turn.

03:41.223 --> 03:43.423
Anyway, we will not
be needing this.

03:45.503 --> 03:48.743
- I knew we should've done it my way.
- What was your way?

03:48.743 --> 03:50.703
We don't tell mom we're
doing the photo shoot,

03:50.703 --> 03:53.303
We go ahead and do it
anyway and split the money.

03:53.303 --> 03:55.183
When did you come up
with that?

03:55.183 --> 03:57.343
At the park.
I told you when

03:57.343 --> 03:59.423
The girls'
cross-country team ran by.

03:59.423 --> 04:01.903
Oh, yeah!

04:03.863 --> 04:05.903
What were
we talking about again?

04:07.903 --> 04:10.583
Hi, Charlie.
Teddy here.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.903
So it turns out there's
a Duncan family mystery.

04:12.903 --> 04:15.703
Yeah, yesterday I found out
we have an Uncle Mel.

04:15.703 --> 04:19.303
Does this
look good on me?

04:19.303 --> 04:23.583
Well, only if you pull your pants
over your face, because that is a belt.

04:26.983 --> 04:28.423
We need to go
to the mall today.

04:28.423 --> 04:30.943
You don't have
anything new for me to wear.

04:30.943 --> 04:35.303
Okay, Ivy, I'm thinking about something
a little bit more important than clothes.

04:35.303 --> 04:38.423
- Shoes?
- Family.

04:38.423 --> 04:40.783
You're funny, t.

04:40.783 --> 04:44.383
Okay, listen. Something went down
between my dad and his Uncle Mel

04:44.383 --> 04:45.863
And I have to know
what happened.

04:45.863 --> 04:47.503
What is this?

04:47.503 --> 04:50.503
Oh, that's a credit card
my dad gave me a while ago.

04:50.503 --> 04:53.183
And I'm just now
hearing about this?

04:53.183 --> 04:55.303
Well, it's for
emergencies only.

04:55.303 --> 04:57.903
Honey, I've seen
your closet.

04:57.903 --> 04:59.903
It is an emergency.

04:59.903 --> 05:02.583
Okay. Well, if you go
to the rest home with me,

05:02.583 --> 05:04.543
I will go
to the mall with you.

05:04.583 --> 05:07.183
Okay, but I have
to warn you:

05:07.183 --> 05:08.783
My grandpa was
in a rest home

05:08.783 --> 05:11.583
And it was depressing.
He'd just sit there

05:11.623 --> 05:14.023
And complain about how
nobody ever came to visit.

05:14.023 --> 05:17.023
Finally,
I just stopped going.

05:25.503 --> 05:28.023
We have several options
at Shady Hills:

05:28.023 --> 05:31.103
There's the one-year plan, the
three-year plan and the fi...

05:31.103 --> 05:33.503
How old is your father?

05:33.503 --> 05:37.463
You might want to
go month to month.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.743
Okay. Bye-bye.

05:39.743 --> 05:43.663
Welcome to Shady Hills.
How can I help you?

05:43.663 --> 05:45.783
We're here
to see Mel Duncan.

05:45.783 --> 05:47.463
- Have you signed in?
- No.

05:47.463 --> 05:49.863
Are you waiting
for a formal invitation?

05:49.863 --> 05:53.503
No, we just got here.
We're happy to sign in.

05:53.503 --> 05:55.543
I'd be most honored.

05:56.743 --> 05:58.343
Let me page Mel for you.

05:58.343 --> 06:00.783
Mel, you have
a visitor!

06:02.143 --> 06:03.823
Somebody here
to see me?

06:03.823 --> 06:05.743
Hi, Uncle Mel.

06:05.743 --> 06:08.263
I'm your great-niece Teddy.
I'm Bob's daughter.

06:08.263 --> 06:12.023
You're kidding.
Bob made you?

06:12.023 --> 06:14.703
Yeah, well,
my mom's pretty hot.

06:14.703 --> 06:19.423
- Oh, this is my friend Ivy.
- Hi. My mom's hot too.

06:19.423 --> 06:21.343
Okay.

06:21.343 --> 06:23.423
Hey, everybody,
this is my niece...

06:23.423 --> 06:25.943
- What did you say your name was again?
- Teddy.

06:25.943 --> 06:29.023
- ...Hedy.
- No no, Teddy. Teddy.

06:29.023 --> 06:31.303
That's a weird name.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.383
Weirder than hedy?

06:33.383 --> 06:35.663
This is
my niece Teddy

06:35.663 --> 06:38.343
- And... do you like music?
- I love music.

06:38.343 --> 06:41.383
Hey, everybody, my niece
is gonna sing us some songs.

06:41.383 --> 06:43.223
- I am?
- Yeah.

06:43.223 --> 06:45.463
Ivy, help.

06:45.463 --> 06:49.383
Hi, everybody.

06:49.383 --> 06:51.263
And welcome to...

06:51.263 --> 06:53.343
The room that we're in.

06:53.343 --> 06:57.183
We're gonna start
off with a little...

06:57.183 --> 07:00.303
- Maestro?
- I think I remember "Swanee River."

07:00.343 --> 07:02.903
"Swanee River."

07:04.743 --> 07:10.223
* way down upon
the Swanee River *

07:10.223 --> 07:14.183
* far far away... *

07:14.183 --> 07:15.823
I don't remember
the words.

07:15.823 --> 07:18.583
I only know the dirty
ones from third grade.

07:20.503 --> 07:25.543
* it's such a funny
name for a river *

07:25.543 --> 07:30.663
* and that's all
I have to say, hey. *

07:34.063 --> 07:37.583
Okay, that's enough of that.
Let's try something else.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.583
- Any requests?
- "Swanee River."

07:39.583 --> 07:42.223
Oh, boy.

07:46.743 --> 07:48.983
It's almost ready to go. You've
got a real cute baby there,

07:48.983 --> 07:50.703
One of the best
I've ever seen.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.383
Yeah yeah,
did you bring the cash?

07:52.383 --> 07:56.703
I did, but first I need a
parent to sign this release form.

07:56.703 --> 08:00.583
No problemo.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.103
Problemo.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.543
Sure. Mom is
right in the kitchen.

08:05.543 --> 08:07.263
- She is?
- She is.

08:07.263 --> 08:09.423
Gabe, why don't you
go into the kitchen

08:09.423 --> 08:12.783
And have mom sign
this for us?

08:15.943 --> 08:19.303
So you're
a photographer, huh?

08:20.503 --> 08:21.943
Yup.

08:23.183 --> 08:25.543
Oh, I got a camera
for my seventh birthday...

08:25.543 --> 08:28.783
- Then I lost it.
- Cute story.

08:28.783 --> 08:32.143
Well, here you go.

08:34.183 --> 08:37.703
Your mom has
very nice... Printing.

08:37.703 --> 08:39.623
You know, before we start the session

08:39.623 --> 08:41.183
I probably better
go talk to her.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.342
- Very bad idea.
- And why is that?

08:43.342 --> 08:45.743
Because she's
in one of her moods

08:45.743 --> 08:47.503
And now she wants
more money.

08:47.503 --> 08:50.103
She does?
How much?

08:50.103 --> 08:52.983
- 125 dollars.
- What?

08:52.983 --> 08:56.143
- But we agreed on 100 dollars.
- Walter, I've been riding

08:56.143 --> 08:58.503
This rollercoaster
for the past 17 years.

08:58.503 --> 09:00.583
Let me handle it.

09:01.703 --> 09:03.103
This is
a strange situation.

09:03.103 --> 09:05.023
The moms almost always
want to meet me.

09:05.023 --> 09:07.863
This one just wants
her money.

09:07.863 --> 09:09.943
Pack it up.
The show's over.

09:09.943 --> 09:11.743
- What? What happened?
- She wants you out.

09:11.743 --> 09:14.543
You don't understand.
I have a deadline to meet.

09:14.543 --> 09:16.383
We have
to make this work.

09:16.383 --> 09:19.263
Well, you might want
to offer her 150 dollars.

09:20.343 --> 09:23.183
Fine. 150 dollars,
but that's it.

09:23.183 --> 09:25.543
Let me see
what I can do.

09:27.343 --> 09:29.503
Let's make some magic.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.463
And my baby sister's
name is Charlie.

09:36.463 --> 09:39.983
Charlie, Teddy... didn't
your dad know any girl names?

09:39.983 --> 09:42.303
Speaking of my dad,

09:42.303 --> 09:44.463
What exactly happened
between you guys?

09:44.463 --> 09:47.223
- You don't want to hear about that.
- Actually, I do.

09:47.223 --> 09:49.423
Well, look.
We just met

09:49.423 --> 09:51.423
And I'd like
to get to know someone

09:51.423 --> 09:53.943
Before I start saying bad
things about their father.

09:55.423 --> 09:58.063
Okay. Well, let's get
to know each other.

09:58.063 --> 10:01.703
- Tell me about yourself.
- Well, I love baseball.

10:01.703 --> 10:04.743
Hey, there's a game today.
Will you take me?

10:04.743 --> 10:06.823
Tell me other things
about yourself.

10:06.823 --> 10:10.823
Oh, come on. I haven't been
to a ballgame in forever.

10:10.823 --> 10:13.583
- I'd give anything to go to one.
- Well, today?

10:13.583 --> 10:17.423
- I don't know. I promised my
friend... - yeah yeah, fine, thanks.

10:17.423 --> 10:19.103
Thanks for dropping by.

10:19.103 --> 10:23.583
See you in 20 years.
I'll be sitting right here.

10:23.583 --> 10:27.103
T. You've got
to try this.

10:27.103 --> 10:29.143
- What is it?
- Steak and potatoes.

10:29.143 --> 10:31.183
They can blend
anything in this place.

10:31.183 --> 10:33.183
Okay, Ivy. Hey.

10:33.183 --> 10:35.303
What would you say
to a little change in plans?

10:35.303 --> 10:38.103
- Am I gonna like this change?
- It involves us getting out of here.

10:38.103 --> 10:40.063
- I'm in.
- We're going to a ballgame.

10:40.063 --> 10:41.943
- I'm out.
- Fine, then stay here.

10:41.943 --> 10:44.623
- Back in.
- Mel, come on, let's go.

10:44.623 --> 10:47.743
- We're going to the ballgame
- hot dog! Sounds great,

10:47.743 --> 10:50.143
But first we've got
to get past the warden.

10:50.143 --> 10:53.263
I'll handle her.

10:54.663 --> 10:57.023
Excuse me.
I'd like to take

10:57.023 --> 10:58.983
- Mel out for the afternoon.
- Are you over 18 years of age?

10:58.983 --> 11:00.503
- No.
- Is he dead?

11:00.503 --> 11:02.503
- No.
- Request denied.

11:02.503 --> 11:04.863
Step away
from the desk.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.623
Thank you for your time.

11:08.623 --> 11:11.143
Plan B.

11:11.143 --> 11:13.863
- Right.
- Break.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.463
I'm sorry, dude.

11:17.463 --> 11:19.143
It's for a good cause.

11:23.103 --> 11:26.463
- We've got a roller!
- Not on my watch we don't.

11:47.263 --> 11:50.383
- You having a good time, Uncle Mel?
- The best.

11:50.383 --> 11:52.783
Oh, this is
terrific, kid.

11:52.783 --> 11:55.183
- Thanks for bringing me.
- Yeah.

11:55.223 --> 11:57.783
So listen. You said
when we got to the game

11:57.783 --> 12:00.423
You were going to tell me
the story about... whoo!

12:00.423 --> 12:03.103
...What happened
between you and dad.

12:03.103 --> 12:05.383
After this inning.

12:05.383 --> 12:07.823
Hot stuff
coming through.

12:07.823 --> 12:11.583
Ivy! Ivy,
what is all this?

12:11.583 --> 12:13.903
It's your fault
for giving me a credit card.

12:13.903 --> 12:16.263
Right. The emergency
credit card.

12:16.263 --> 12:18.863
Some of this stuff could
be used in an emergency.

12:18.863 --> 12:23.383
Right, like if we run
into a giant foam nose.

12:24.823 --> 12:26.903
- It looks like he's having fun.
- Yeah.

12:26.903 --> 12:28.263
Such a sweet old guy.

12:28.263 --> 12:30.223
Who could possibly have
a problem with him?

12:32.903 --> 12:34.183
You stink!

12:34.183 --> 12:37.063
Are you a ballplayer
or a ballerina?!

12:37.063 --> 12:39.063
You make me
want to puke!

12:41.663 --> 12:45.303
* su-su-superstar *

12:45.303 --> 12:47.463
* she's a star,
going far *

12:47.463 --> 12:50.503
* there you are,
su-su-superstar *

12:50.503 --> 12:53.023
* su-su-superstar,
yeah, come on *

12:53.023 --> 12:55.823
* looks all right,
ladylike, day and night *

12:55.823 --> 12:57.743
* come on,
su-su-superstar *

12:57.743 --> 12:59.943
* su-su-superstar *

12:59.983 --> 13:04.103
* grooving the runway
from Monday through Sunday *

13:04.103 --> 13:07.983
* she wrote the book, got the
look, on every magazine, love her *

13:08.023 --> 13:13.023
* superstar, superstar,
that's what you are *

13:13.023 --> 13:16.503
* su-su-superstar,
yeah, a superstar *

13:16.503 --> 13:20.663
* yeah, a superstar,
that's what you are *

13:20.663 --> 13:22.303
* su-su-superstar. *

13:22.303 --> 13:25.983
Careful, cupcake! If you slide,
you might dirty your skirt!

13:25.983 --> 13:28.023
Hey, Uncle Mel,
calm down. We're winning.

13:28.023 --> 13:30.823
Yeah, for now,
but it ain't gonna last.

13:30.823 --> 13:34.023
Because they stink!
Like a sewer, they stink!

13:34.023 --> 13:37.023
Hey, control your grandpa!
He's scaring my kids.

13:37.023 --> 13:40.583
- Hey, your kids stink.
- Sorry. He didn't mean that.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.703
I'm sure your kids
smell awesome.

13:42.703 --> 13:45.783
Okay, Uncle Mel,
why don't you just sit down

13:45.783 --> 13:48.063
And enjoy a nice,
quiet hot dog?

13:48.063 --> 13:50.983
I'd love a hot dog.
Hey, weiner, have a weiner!

13:50.983 --> 13:53.743
- No! - Are you gonna do
something about him or should I?

13:53.743 --> 13:55.863
Yeah, I said I'd handle
it and it would be

13:55.863 --> 13:57.743
A lot easier without
your helpful suggestions.

13:57.743 --> 13:59.743
Oh, well, here's
a helpful suggestion:

13:59.743 --> 14:02.503
Take him out of here
or I take you out of here.

14:02.503 --> 14:04.703
Oh, you shouldn't
have said that,

14:04.703 --> 14:07.023
'cause now Ivy's about
to get out of her chair.

14:07.023 --> 14:09.143
T, hold my ring.

14:09.143 --> 14:11.383
Okay, can we all
just chill?

14:11.383 --> 14:14.103
Hey, losers!
Get a load of this!

14:16.063 --> 14:19.103
No!

14:29.383 --> 14:32.783
Oh no, we're on
the jumbo screen.

14:46.703 --> 14:49.583
Are we almost done?

14:49.583 --> 14:52.183
'cause if not, we're kinda
getting into overtime.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.903
- Is that a problem?
- Not for us.

14:54.903 --> 14:58.063
But for mom. I think
it's gonna cost you.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.223
Exactly what I was
thinking, little brother.

15:00.223 --> 15:02.383
I'm gonna run this
by the boss

15:04.383 --> 15:07.183
Mom. What are
you doing here?

15:07.223 --> 15:11.703
- I live here.
- But you're not supposed to be back yet.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.823
Well, I finished everything I
needed to do... got the car washed,

15:14.823 --> 15:16.623
Did the grocery shopping,
went to the bank.

15:16.623 --> 15:18.703
What is that flashing coming
from the living room?

15:18.703 --> 15:20.823
Oh, it's probably a fuse.
You might want to check

15:20.823 --> 15:23.183
The fuse box
out in the garage.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.543
- Get out! Shut it down!
- What's going on?

15:30.543 --> 15:32.583
Mom's home.
She's really home.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.943
Get out!

15:36.503 --> 15:40.143
- What's going on here?
- P.J, you want to take that one?

15:40.143 --> 15:42.543
No, I'll take
the next one.

15:42.583 --> 15:45.303
I can't believe
you two disobeyed me.

15:45.303 --> 15:48.543
Oh, my poor little baby.

15:49.863 --> 15:52.303
I love it...
mom and baby.

15:52.303 --> 15:54.343
Look. Please stop.
Just get out.

15:54.343 --> 15:56.623
- But you look so good together.
- No, seriously... get out.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.583
- Perfect. Just like that.
- Like that?

15:58.583 --> 16:01.023
- Yes.
- And how about a little of this?

16:01.023 --> 16:04.263
- Great.
- Wait. Get my better side.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.463
Wow. Mom,
you're a natural.

16:07.463 --> 16:12.143
- Yeah, the camera loves you.
- You two are so grounded.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.743
Then the police
politely asked us to leave,

16:21.743 --> 16:24.783
At which point Uncle Mel
invited them to kiss something

16:24.783 --> 16:26.863
That had been
on the jumbo screen.

16:26.863 --> 16:29.343
Oh, good. All right.

16:29.343 --> 16:32.423
Now you know why I wanted you
to stay away from your Uncle Mel.

16:32.423 --> 16:36.023
The guy's a maniac, especially
when it comes to baseball.

16:36.023 --> 16:39.063
Yeah, that would've
been useful information.

16:40.063 --> 16:42.223
You know what?
Just go to bed.

16:42.223 --> 16:43.983
I really don't want
to talk about this anymore.

16:43.983 --> 16:46.343
Well, there is
one more thing

16:46.343 --> 16:48.423
I should tell you
about Uncle Mel.

16:48.423 --> 16:50.463
- Yeah? What's that?
- He's in the living room.

16:50.463 --> 16:52.503
- What?!
- You have to talk to him.

16:52.503 --> 16:57.223
No, I don't. I don't. I've
got nothing to say to him.

16:57.223 --> 17:00.663
What is this all about, anyway?
Why won't anybody tell me?

17:00.663 --> 17:03.223
Because it's
ancient history.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.343
All right? It's done.
It's forgotten about.

17:05.343 --> 17:08.943
I've moved on. Now get that
old fart out of my house!

17:10.183 --> 17:12.183
Be right back.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.703
So dad says welcome.

17:15.703 --> 17:19.542
He doesn't want
to talk to me, does he?

17:19.542 --> 17:21.343
Well, I don't want
to talk to him either!

17:21.343 --> 17:23.022
And you can
tell him I said that.

17:23.022 --> 17:25.303
I'll be right back.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.663
Uncle Mel says
he loves you.

17:29.663 --> 17:31.663
Really?

17:31.663 --> 17:33.903
Uncle Mel said that?

17:33.903 --> 17:36.703
Yeah, he said
something like that.

17:36.703 --> 17:39.023
It's so long since
I've been in the living room.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.143
Well, when is he gonna
leave the living room?

17:42.143 --> 17:44.143
Okay, Uncle Mel wants
to sort this thing out.

17:44.143 --> 17:46.983
- Maybe you should start.
- I think he should start.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.023
I'll be right back.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.783
Dad says he loves you.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.743
Hogwash!

17:56.743 --> 17:59.623
And he thinks
it would help

17:59.623 --> 18:01.703
If you told me
what this feud was about.

18:04.143 --> 18:07.623
When your father was 10 years
old, I was his baseball coach.

18:07.623 --> 18:10.743
Oh. Now I get it.

18:11.863 --> 18:13.703
What's that
supposed to mean?

18:13.703 --> 18:17.423
Well, you get a little bit
too excited about baseball.

18:17.423 --> 18:20.303
I share my opinions!

18:20.303 --> 18:23.983
Anyway, I gave him some
constructive criticism...

18:23.983 --> 18:27.423
You said I swung
like a girl!

18:27.423 --> 18:30.583
I was sugar-coating it!
You swung like a baby girl!

18:30.583 --> 18:33.503
Hey, we're talking.
This is a start.

18:33.503 --> 18:36.423
You humiliated me in front
of the entire team.

18:36.423 --> 18:38.463
I was trying
to make you better.

18:38.463 --> 18:40.423
Well, you didn't yell
at any of the other kids.

18:40.423 --> 18:44.223
Because I didn't care about
any of the other kids, fathead!

18:45.343 --> 18:47.183
Whoa.
Did you hear that?

18:47.183 --> 18:48.903
Before the fathead part.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.903
He said
he cared about you.

18:52.863 --> 18:55.343
I was trying
to make you tough

18:55.343 --> 18:57.623
And I guess

18:57.623 --> 19:01.663
Sometimes I got
a little carried away.

19:01.663 --> 19:06.623
- I'm sorry.
- We have an apology. Hey, dad.

19:09.543 --> 19:14.783
Well, maybe sometimes I was
a little oversensitive...

19:14.783 --> 19:16.943
And I'm sorry.

19:16.943 --> 19:18.943
And a return apology.

19:18.943 --> 19:21.623
Now you know what we do in
this family after we fight?

19:21.623 --> 19:23.583
I'm hoping eat.

19:25.143 --> 19:27.663
We hug.

19:27.663 --> 19:30.423
- Hugging's for girls.
- Baby girls.

19:30.423 --> 19:32.983
That's...

19:35.023 --> 19:37.303
I gotta tinkle.

19:37.303 --> 19:39.783
Be back in 20 minutes.

19:39.783 --> 19:42.103
Right over there.

19:43.463 --> 19:45.623
Come here.

19:45.623 --> 19:48.623
You did good, kid.
Thank you.

19:48.623 --> 19:50.703
Yeah, well,
you guys are always saying

19:50.703 --> 19:53.783
- How important family is.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

19:53.783 --> 19:57.783
He just walked into the'?

19:57.783 --> 20:01.183
- I'm afraid so.
- Hey, Mel,

20:01.183 --> 20:03.783
- That's not a bathroom.
- It is now!

20:07.463 --> 20:11.503
Well, Charlie, here I am
waiting for you and mom,

20:11.503 --> 20:15.143
'cause mom said I have to
see this, whatever this is.

20:15.143 --> 20:18.583
Here we come.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.863
Look at you two!

20:20.863 --> 20:22.343
Why are you
dressed like that?

20:22.343 --> 20:24.663
Well, we had
a casting.

20:25.823 --> 20:28.503
In the professional
modeling business,

20:28.503 --> 20:30.983
That's what
an audition is called...

20:30.983 --> 20:33.823
A casting.

20:33.823 --> 20:36.663
So you're
a professional model now?

20:36.663 --> 20:39.423
Oh, don't act
surprised, Teddy.

20:39.423 --> 20:41.903
I think we all knew
this day was coming.

20:49.303 --> 20:51.623
She's a model now.

20:53.023 --> 20:55.943
If I knew raising parents
was gonna be this hard,

20:55.943 --> 20:57.823
Never would've done it.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.743
But soon enough
it'll be your turn

20:59.743 --> 21:01.463
So good luck, Charlie.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.343
P.J. Duncan,
here to see my parents.

21:17.863 --> 21:19.423
Hey, mom!

21:19.423 --> 21:21.343
I'll be right
with you, P.J.

21:21.343 --> 21:24.223
I'm in the middle of class.
We're really gonna push it.

21:24.223 --> 21:25.863
We're gonna
touch our toes.

21:25.863 --> 21:28.063
And touch your toes.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.183
Or your knees.

21:31.183 --> 21:33.663
You know what?
Just do the best you can.

21:33.663 --> 21:36.263
Okay, now we're
gonna squat.

21:36.303 --> 21:39.303
Oh, take it down!
Gotta feel the burn.

21:39.303 --> 21:40.703
Here we go.

21:40.703 --> 21:42.943
Oh, no!

21:42.943 --> 21:45.823
Bob, I'm locked again.

21:45.823 --> 21:48.383
Bob!

21:48.383 --> 21:51.543
"Swanee River"!

21:53.303 --> 21:55.623
Here, mom. I gotcha.

21:55.623 --> 21:57.183
Oh, thank you, P.J.

21:57.183 --> 22:00.303
Oh, sorry I'm late, guys.

22:00.303 --> 22:02.943
That was a long walk in
from the parking lot.

22:12.383 --> 22:15.823
That's what happens when
you don't do the squats.
