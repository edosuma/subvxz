00:51.990 --> 00:55.430
Hey, you! Move those trucks now!

00:55.530 --> 00:58.197
Come on, guys, lock it up.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.540
Gentlemen, I know
we've been over this already,

01:06.640 --> 01:09.780
and I know this isn't your first rodeo.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.420
Just keep in mind what's at stake here,

01:12.520 --> 01:16.617
possibly the largest deposit
of iridium we have ever seen.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.420
Geological formation
is like nothing else on earth.

01:20.520 --> 01:24.790
Well, you've gotta love Mother Nature.
She's full of surprises.

01:24.890 --> 01:26.430
Keep your techs handy.

01:26.530 --> 01:31.400
If anything spikes, do not
attempt to remove it yourself.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.940
We will send in the extractors.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.285
Do I make myself clear?

01:36.385 --> 01:38.877
What's with the extra security?

01:39.840 --> 01:41.436
It keeps everything honest.

01:41.536 --> 01:45.296
We need more diggers, not babysitters.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.750
All right, boys, you heard the lady.

01:51.850 --> 01:56.227
All right, you apes,
let's rock and roll!

02:04.470 --> 02:08.476
<i>Warning! Blast preparation underway.
Please clear the area.</i>

02:08.576 --> 02:12.582
<i>Warning! Blast preparation underway.
Please clear the area.</i>

02:35.970 --> 02:39.040
- How's it going, Bobby?
- A little jammed.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.610
All right.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.340
All right, hold on for a second.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.137
Biggs!

02:45.540 --> 02:48.010
- This is Quaid to Sinclair.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

02:48.110 --> 02:50.550
We got a drill stuck on the 3400 mark.

02:50.650 --> 02:53.820
<i>I don't care. Blow it if you have to.
We have a schedule.</i>

02:53.920 --> 02:55.790
All right, copy that.

02:55.890 --> 03:00.393
I guess we're going to lose the drill.
We'll blow it anyway. Move out.

03:00.790 --> 03:03.797
You got five minutes to clear it
before we go hot, Bobby.

03:04.630 --> 03:06.267
Charges!

03:27.980 --> 03:30.350
Yeah, that's good.
That's good right there.

03:30.450 --> 03:33.757
All right, everybody clear out!

03:35.460 --> 03:37.592
So what's with this stuff anyway?

03:37.692 --> 03:39.657
I don't know.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.989
All I know is it pays
real good to dig it up.

03:43.470 --> 03:46.467
As rare as they come
and worth a fortune.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.977
I hear it's radioactive.

03:52.110 --> 03:55.684
Well, so are some of the women you date.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.264
All right, here we go!

03:59.980 --> 04:01.990
Fire in the hole!

04:14.030 --> 04:17.425
Any traces?
Come on, Biggs, check it out.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.800
Whole mess of it.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.267
And it's hollow in there.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.840
Hold on. You mole men are done.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.750
Back up to surface.
We'll send down the extractors.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.482
- Well, I just wanna peek.
- You heard me.

04:32.582 --> 04:36.117
Yeah, I did, but I'm a little curious.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.357
What the hell was that?

05:03.150 --> 05:05.677
Hey, you just shot at my friend!

05:13.040 --> 05:14.988
Go, go, go!

05:16.761 --> 05:18.855
Run, run, run!

05:20.730 --> 05:23.997
Get up! Come on, get up! Get up!

06:06.880 --> 06:09.210
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a round of applause for the cowboys,</i>

06:09.310 --> 06:12.280
<i>and welcome to the 69th
Annual Livingston Rodeo.</i>

06:12.380 --> 06:15.958
<i>Next up is the golden boy from Big Temple,
Montana, pro bull riding champion</i>

06:16.058 --> 06:18.417
<i>Val Walker, the hometown hero.</i>

06:35.370 --> 06:37.740
<i>You couldn't have bull riding
without championship bulls,</i>

06:37.840 --> 06:41.546
<i>and Val is riding a beast
of an animal named Weatherby.</i>

06:46.020 --> 06:48.057
<i>Here we go!</i>

07:20.850 --> 07:23.090
<i>There's a hangup!
He's taken a terrible fall!</i>

07:23.190 --> 07:26.543
<i>Val Walker is down, and he is hurt.</i>

07:27.390 --> 07:28.339
<i>Somebody get a bucket</i>

07:28.439 --> 07:32.254
<i>because you're gonna need to pick up
the pieces of that young man. Look at that.</i>

07:32.354 --> 07:33.950
<i>I don't care if you're tougher
than owl meat.</i>

07:34.050 --> 07:37.145
<i>That was a beating
of prehistoric proportions.</i>

08:19.240 --> 08:22.708
Ranch must be haunted or something
'cause I think I'm seeing a ghost.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.987
Ain't no ghost.

08:26.150 --> 08:28.387
Wanna give her a shot?

08:29.890 --> 08:34.871
- Come on. Chuy don't buck.
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.330
You got any work up at the ranch?

08:37.429 --> 08:41.081
You know, I'd like to hire another hand,
but I just can't afford it.

08:42.030 --> 08:45.206
- How about the Quartermains?
- Doubt it.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.870
How long has it been
since you been on a horse?

08:48.970 --> 08:50.261
Been a while.

08:50.361 --> 08:52.380
Heard you were a boat captain
or something.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.810
No, I was no captain.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.060
You could start riding again.
There's still some pay money in that.

09:00.850 --> 09:03.940
- No, thanks.
- Hey, look, don't be sore.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.920
If you're gonna stay in town,
you can check for work up at the mines.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.660
Mines? I ain't no miner.

09:09.760 --> 09:13.016
Well, if you can't ride a horse,
you sure ain't no cowboy.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.170
They had some sort of accident
up there the other day.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.400
Wade and his boys are working up there.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.110
How's the pay?

09:23.210 --> 09:26.007
Don't know. I ain't no miner.

09:27.240 --> 09:31.750
Hey, look, don't you want
to hear about Sky?

09:31.850 --> 09:34.647
You know, she still
waiting tables in town.

09:37.220 --> 09:40.340
- How is she?
- Sweet as ever.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.757
This is awesome.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.490
What are you waiting for?

10:16.590 --> 10:20.330
I don't know. What if there's someone
that can see us?

10:20.430 --> 10:22.300
No one is out here.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.330
Everyone has already
seen you naked anyway.

10:25.430 --> 10:28.197
- Yuck!
- Shut up.

10:28.870 --> 10:31.040
Let 'em watch. That's what I say.

10:31.140 --> 10:35.196
Besides, if we catch any Peeping Toms,
we can just tell the old sheriff, right?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.907
Come on.

10:41.820 --> 10:44.158
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

11:03.910 --> 11:07.117
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- I know.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.710
Did you find another spot?

11:11.810 --> 11:15.390
It's right here. This little up current
in just the right place.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.920
Gross!

11:18.020 --> 11:22.160
You know you're gonna miss us, Sky.
What are you gonna do here without us?

11:22.260 --> 11:25.590
Hang out and bone
the old sheriff all day?

11:25.690 --> 11:28.527
Jonie, shut up already.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.437
Who's over there?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.307
- Pervert, come out!
- There's nobody.

11:41.780 --> 11:43.135
Hey, ladies.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.510
Oh, it's just Jim.

11:45.610 --> 11:48.265
I thought it was a man spying on us.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.420
Hey, Sky.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.517
Hey, Jim.

11:53.190 --> 11:56.001
All right, well, I gotta go, ladies.

11:56.101 --> 11:58.030
What? Why?

11:58.130 --> 12:02.327
No, actually I do have to go to work,
and I don't wanna be late, but call me after.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.167
Wait, wait, I'll ride with you.
Bye, guys.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.576
Don't creep on them like that.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.680
What Sky's problem anyhow?

12:25.780 --> 12:29.490
You got a problem.
Don't talk about her like that.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.453
She just hates wild men like you.

12:37.130 --> 12:40.570
- I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?
- Heck, yeah.

12:40.670 --> 12:42.977
I wasn't talking to you.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.361
Hey, the Cowboy's back.

13:24.150 --> 13:26.280
How you doing, buddy?

13:26.380 --> 13:28.517
Can't complain.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.050
Any work here?

13:31.150 --> 13:34.731
There was an accident.
We think three are dead.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.330
What happened?

13:37.130 --> 13:40.970
It's real bad. Quaid came up.
Something's wrong with him.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.792
He's on, ranting, raving about creatures
in the mine or something.

13:46.670 --> 13:49.697
I take it that means
they ain't hiring today.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.973
What are you doing back here?

13:54.610 --> 13:56.677
Getting something to eat.

14:00.120 --> 14:04.127
- I never thought I'd see him again.
- Especially after what happened.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.410
Oh, my God.

14:23.510 --> 14:26.882
Tina! Tina!

14:26.982 --> 14:28.837
What the...

14:29.750 --> 14:31.377
No!

14:48.260 --> 14:51.681
You stop going on about monsters
and tell me what happened.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.640
A bunch of men went down there,
and only you came out.

14:54.740 --> 14:58.440
You need to wake up.
We let something loose in those mines,

14:58.540 --> 15:01.540
and they ain't gonna stop
until they eat every single one of us.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.080
There's 100 tons of rock
collapsed in that mine.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.417
The drift is entirely blocked.

15:07.517 --> 15:10.480
Do you know how long
it's gonna take to get cleared?

15:12.870 --> 15:15.329
Mr. Marcus is gonna kill me.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.907
He's gonna kill you, too.

15:19.340 --> 15:23.320
Then he needs to take a number because
if we don't seal off that mine completely,

15:23.420 --> 15:25.480
something else will do
the job just fine.

15:25.580 --> 15:29.257
Do you know how stupid you sound?
Completely insane!

15:33.460 --> 15:35.943
- Maybe we should consider...
- Consider what?

15:36.043 --> 15:39.000
That monsters blew up the drift
and killed my people?

15:39.100 --> 15:43.770
You listen to me, woman!
Those are my people, my friends.

15:43.870 --> 15:47.990
Now, they may have been on your payroll,
but those are my men down there.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.377
You understand?

15:53.780 --> 15:56.405
What's the call, Sheriff?
Boys are getting restless out there.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.534
This mine is shut down
until further notice.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.157
Not for long.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.027
Mr. Marcus is on his way.

16:27.310 --> 16:28.817
I can cover for you.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.497
No, it's fine.

16:34.050 --> 16:36.247
He's at one of my tables.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.647
What are you having?

17:05.819 --> 17:07.887
A cup of coffee...

17:08.690 --> 17:11.887
and... and the lunch special.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.989
You look good.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.936
Coffee and the special.
I'll be on break.

17:41.930 --> 17:46.300
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey, baby. Can you come down here?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.930
- <i>Why? What's going on?</i>
- Actually, Val just showed up.

17:50.030 --> 17:53.844
- <i>Val. Val the...</i>
- Yeah, that Val.

17:54.530 --> 17:57.570
- <i>Look...</i>
- Can you please come down here?

17:57.670 --> 18:00.620
<i>Okay, look, I'm gonna drop what I'm doing.
You stay away from him.</i>

18:00.720 --> 18:01.560
Okay.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.250
- <i>I'm on my way. You stay in the kitchen.</i>
- Okay, I will, I will.

18:05.350 --> 18:09.650
- <i>No matter what, don't go near him.</i>
- I love you.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.377
- <i>Yeah, I love you, too.</i>
- Bye, baby.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.556
Quaid, you ain't supposed
to be down here.

18:23.956 --> 18:26.700
It's off limits. The mine is closed.
Now, come on!

18:26.800 --> 18:31.040
- No, you don't understand.
- Quaid, look, I understand.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.944
It's a tough thing,
but you can't take it personal.

18:35.670 --> 18:38.295
John, nobody understands.

18:38.810 --> 18:42.110
Quaid, I'm gonna give you time
to get over this now.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.617
Now, come on, we gotta get out of here.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.420
Yeah! John, look at this.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.357
It's a piece of flesh. Now look at it.
Now, what does it smell like to you?

18:55.660 --> 18:59.029
- That smells like...
- Yeah, it does.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.916
- Now, come on, we gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

19:48.710 --> 19:52.047
Just what the hell you think
you're doing, cowboy?

19:53.050 --> 19:55.620
Finishing up my steak.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.506
You know I'm not talking
about a goddamn ribeye.

19:59.860 --> 20:03.015
I thought we had ourselves
an understanding.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.268
You know...

20:06.668 --> 20:08.691
she was my girl.

20:09.470 --> 20:12.615
Just 'cause you swooped in
while I was gone,

20:12.715 --> 20:15.272
that doesn't change anything.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.734
All right, here's what you're gonna do.

20:19.834 --> 20:23.461
You're gonna get up and walk
out that door to that rusty old truck

20:23.561 --> 20:26.850
you got parked in front,
and you're gonna get in it and drive

20:26.950 --> 20:31.690
till the radiator busts, the head gaskets
blow, and the wheels come off,

20:31.790 --> 20:34.410
just as far from here as possible...

20:34.510 --> 20:36.575
and stay there.

20:36.675 --> 20:38.597
You hear me?

20:42.030 --> 20:44.805
But I haven't settled my bill yet.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.803
Maybe I'm not being clear.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.852
That supposed to scare me?

21:00.952 --> 21:04.070
No, I already know
you're too stupid to be scared.

21:04.170 --> 21:07.460
Well, you know I'm not stupid enough
to think that you're gonna shoot me

21:07.560 --> 21:09.957
here in a diner full of people.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.341
Get up and start walking.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.744
Have it your way.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.370
Are you okay?

21:54.670 --> 21:59.322
Don't you ever pull that gun on me again,
unless you plan on pulling the trigger.

21:59.422 --> 22:02.318
You really screwed up this time, cowboy.

22:02.418 --> 22:04.806
You just struck an officer of the law.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.390
What are you gonna do?

22:08.490 --> 22:10.027
You gonna arrest me?

22:18.060 --> 22:20.100
You don't believe that.

22:20.200 --> 22:24.070
All right, all right, whatever you need.

22:24.170 --> 22:27.147
Right. Good night.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.587
- Who was that?
- Sinclair.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.767
What did she want?

22:36.780 --> 22:39.830
I can't make heads or tails
of what went on down there.

22:39.930 --> 22:41.860
Quaid's always been
a little off his rocker.

22:41.960 --> 22:42.810
Quaid?

22:42.910 --> 22:46.360
But a blast mistake that severe?
I just don't see it.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.980
Rumors spread fast.
The whole town is talking.

22:50.080 --> 22:50.900
What?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.730
That he unleashed some kind
of monster, a dinosaur?

22:54.830 --> 22:56.470
Oh, now you don't believe that.

22:56.570 --> 22:59.350
Maybe not a dinosaur,
but some kind of creature.

22:59.450 --> 23:01.270
Oh, like a raptor?

23:01.370 --> 23:03.940
Scientists are discovering
new things every day.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.540
- Raptor!
- Stop it. That's not funny.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.650
- Raptor!
- Stop it. You're not funny.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.299
- Stop it! This is not funny! Stop it.
- Raptor gonna get you!

23:10.399 --> 23:12.217
Stop it.

23:13.750 --> 23:16.360
Raptor! Raptor gonna get you.

23:16.460 --> 23:20.089
- It's not funny.
- We're gonna do it raptor-style.

24:12.540 --> 24:16.571
I was there that day
when you fell off that bull.

24:16.671 --> 24:19.040
We all thought you were gonna die.

24:19.340 --> 24:22.450
That's fine. You don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to.

24:22.550 --> 24:26.120
- Sounds good.
- But what happened to you, anyhow?

24:26.220 --> 24:30.482
It was kind of like you just...
dropped off the face of the earth.

24:31.030 --> 24:33.260
How long am I gonna be in here anyway?

24:33.360 --> 24:37.665
Well, Sheriff has his mind set
on keeping you here.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.437
I'll bet.

24:41.370 --> 24:43.380
You're better off behind those bars.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.823
He doesn't seem to like you much.

24:46.923 --> 24:49.217
Feelings mutual.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.590
There's no sense reliving the past.

25:28.950 --> 25:32.660
- Tell me what's gonna happen to him.
- Don't worry about it.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.283
Are you gonna let him go?

25:34.383 --> 25:36.660
- Let him go?
- Yeah.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.500
No.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.864
No. He was fool enough to hit me.

25:40.964 --> 25:45.434
I'll hold him as long as I can, then ship him
up to County once charges are drawn up.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.407
Lord knows he can't afford bail.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.357
You still care for that boy.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.477
After all he did.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.508
He hit you.

25:59.806 --> 26:03.120
He left you high and dry,
and you sit there pining over him.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.820
I know, but what happened
back then wasn't his fault.

26:05.920 --> 26:09.610
Yeah, he got hurt riding.
Everybody knows.

26:09.710 --> 26:13.030
Golden boy broke his shoulder,
fell into drugs and alcohol.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.930
Look, everybody gets knocked down
once in a while.

26:16.030 --> 26:20.087
It's how you handle it,
and he didn't handle it.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.680
You should've filed charges
the first time you had a chance.

26:28.780 --> 26:32.241
I'm not gonna let you make
that mistake again, all right?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.920
Listen to me! Listen!

26:35.020 --> 26:39.334
It's not like he's a changed man.
He's still the same old Val.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.790
Don't do you ever handle me like that!

26:42.890 --> 26:47.366
And I will choose how I want to feel
about him, okay? Do you got that?

27:27.740 --> 27:30.648
Hey, John, let me borrow
your methane detector.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.693
John, come on, open up.
Are you in there?

27:35.110 --> 27:36.887
John!

28:20.960 --> 28:22.697
Yeah.

28:32.770 --> 28:37.693
Put concrete column here,
here, here, and here.

28:38.410 --> 28:41.221
We'll move all of the equipment.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.447
That'll be all.

29:03.940 --> 29:07.428
Are you happy with your paycheck,
Ms. Sinclair?

29:07.528 --> 29:09.370
Yes, sir.

29:09.470 --> 29:13.610
Was I not clear about my timetable?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.993
Yes, sir, I was perfectly clear.

29:16.093 --> 29:20.269
Do you consider yourself
to be qualified for this position?

29:20.750 --> 29:24.867
The board advised me
not to hire a girl out of college.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.530
Guess I was wrong.

29:27.630 --> 29:31.500
Sir, with all due respect,
the situation was out of my control.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.288
Control?

29:33.700 --> 29:35.453
Control?

29:35.553 --> 29:37.800
It is chaotic!

29:37.900 --> 29:41.470
Chaos reigns, Ms. Sinclair.

29:41.870 --> 29:45.230
I have worked in these mines.
I have driven trucks.

29:45.330 --> 29:47.380
I have worked my way up to management.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.720
Good management
does not let this happen.

29:50.820 --> 29:56.757
Good management
has foresight, Ms. Sinclair!

30:01.460 --> 30:03.312
Now...

30:03.712 --> 30:07.264
I am bringing this mine back online.

30:07.364 --> 30:10.840
I want that iridium extracted

30:10.940 --> 30:14.600
by the end of this week.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.470
But, sir, that's impossible.

30:16.570 --> 30:20.029
Just to clear the rubble for survivors
is gonna take months.

30:20.950 --> 30:24.447
Plans have changed.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.387
You are dismissed.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.085
You want some Gothic ranch action?

32:54.300 --> 32:57.327
Damn it. Not again.

33:07.450 --> 33:09.477
Tell you what.

33:12.250 --> 33:15.758
Tell you what. I'm gonna park it.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.146
Yeah, boy.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.487
Hey, partner, you could use
the bucket here.

33:26.230 --> 33:28.779
Buckets are good, yeah.

33:29.530 --> 33:31.040
Buckets are good.

33:31.140 --> 33:35.070
Maybe... just keep it...
keep it over there.

33:35.170 --> 33:38.587
Yeah, you don't wanna get that
too close to you, right?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.677
Val Walker.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.827
I taught you how to use
a phone, didn't I?

34:01.300 --> 34:03.397
When d'you get back?

34:05.500 --> 34:08.926
Greener pastures
ain't always so green, boy?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.679
Hey, Pa.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.607
Hey, boy.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.217
Looking good.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.659
Oh, that got it.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.001
Can you believe it?

34:47.580 --> 34:49.621
Is our...

34:49.722 --> 34:52.668
our foreman joining us here
for this meeting?

34:52.768 --> 34:57.260
Apparently he was attacked
by a wild animal in his home last night.

34:57.990 --> 35:01.557
- And the sheriff?
- He's handling it.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.457
I see.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.327
Gentlemen.

35:10.890 --> 35:12.947
Thank you for coming out.

35:13.047 --> 35:15.610
First let me say
that we here at Lando Mining,

35:15.710 --> 35:19.771
our priority is the safety
of our employees.

35:19.871 --> 35:24.550
That latest incident has been reviewed
by the best minds we can hire.

35:24.650 --> 35:29.116
We put in place safety measures
so that this cannot happen again.

35:29.216 --> 35:31.860
What's happening with the mine?

35:31.960 --> 35:37.177
Fine. Then let's get to the meat
of the subject, shall we?

35:40.970 --> 35:45.046
Before the explosion,
the demo team's handhelds

35:45.146 --> 35:49.456
were transmitting some very,
very interesting data.

35:50.680 --> 35:54.777
A hollow space adjacent to the main dig...

35:54.880 --> 36:00.720
with traces of iridium
like we have never seen before.

36:00.820 --> 36:04.660
Just to clarify, the reason
why we've chosen the site

36:04.760 --> 36:08.080
is the geological formation
is without precedent.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.560
What about the men?

36:09.660 --> 36:12.830
If we access the hollow space
from the other side,

36:12.930 --> 36:15.734
we can clear a path to look for the men.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.470
Clearing that main drift
is near impossible.

36:18.570 --> 36:21.541
By the time we get rid
of all those rocks,

36:21.641 --> 36:23.243
those men will have perished.

36:23.343 --> 36:26.810
- So now what?
- Where's my money?

36:27.710 --> 36:30.450
We will blast our way straight down.

36:30.550 --> 36:34.120
Is that safe? That's a lot
of ordnance for one blast.

36:34.220 --> 36:37.090
- Yeah, that's crazy.
- And I have safety concerns about that.

36:37.390 --> 36:41.252
It's perfectly safe,
and the placement will not affect

36:41.352 --> 36:45.030
any rescue effort on the other side
of the hollow space.

36:45.130 --> 36:50.470
Now, this plan has been signed off
by my esteemed colleague.

36:50.570 --> 36:53.337
She will be putting it into play.

36:54.470 --> 36:57.710
Gentlemen, I thank you for coming out.

36:57.810 --> 36:59.219
That's it?

39:03.530 --> 39:05.351
These rooms here I think are a little small,

39:05.451 --> 39:08.424
but I need to move
the walls out about six feet.

39:08.870 --> 39:13.690
What the hell is going on here?
I thought I shut this place down.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.717
All right.

39:19.950 --> 39:24.442
And I waved my magic wand
and opened it again.

39:24.542 --> 39:28.030
You could at least pretend
I've got some authority around here.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.180
Oh, but you do, Henry. You really do.

39:31.280 --> 39:35.277
You're a valued member
of this operation.

39:36.630 --> 39:40.470
By the way, thanks for being
at the meeting this morning.

39:40.870 --> 39:43.240
Your foreman is dead.

39:43.340 --> 39:46.600
Yes, I heard about that bear attack.

39:46.700 --> 39:49.087
Wasn't no bear attack.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.114
What do you make of this?

39:55.350 --> 39:57.660
You sure as hell know
that ain't a bear claw.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.590
You know what that looks like?

39:59.690 --> 40:04.864
Yeah. It looks like a really big claw.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.937
It doesn't look like
it's from any known living species.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.037
Could it be a fossil?

40:13.340 --> 40:15.275
It sure as hell isn't a fossil.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.810
What the hell is happening out there?

40:18.910 --> 40:20.729
You all thought I was crazy.

40:20.829 --> 40:23.340
You thought I didn't know
what I was talking about.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.020
You all thought that old Quaid
has lost his marbles.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.018
Quaid!

40:28.118 --> 40:31.220
Well, boys, feast your eyes!

40:32.208 --> 40:34.017
Get down!

40:40.660 --> 40:42.664
It's a mountain lion.

40:42.830 --> 40:46.600
It's the mountain lion I believe is
responsible for the death of the foreman

40:46.700 --> 40:49.868
and the attack on the swimmers
at Lava Lake.

40:50.940 --> 40:54.040
I'm gonna take this in
as evidence, your truck.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.810
- I'm gonna take you in for questioning.
- What?

40:56.910 --> 41:00.150
- Sheriff, what the hell is that?
- It's just a mountain lion.

41:00.250 --> 41:04.120
No. No, I told you what it was. You didn't
listen to me. There ain't no mountain lion.

41:04.220 --> 41:07.387
- That is a dinosaur!
- You trying to cause a panic?

41:07.490 --> 41:10.590
You cause a panic in my town, Quaid,
and it's gonna be your ass.

41:10.690 --> 41:12.587
Henry!

41:13.830 --> 41:16.366
You're taking care of this, right?

41:17.230 --> 41:21.931
All right, guys, back to work.
Those charges need to be set by noon.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.177
Get in the truck.

42:18.530 --> 42:21.643
- Give me a hand with this thing.
- Why? What are you gonna do with it?

42:21.743 --> 42:24.259
You gonna put me in a cell
with this dead dino carcass?

42:27.640 --> 42:29.316
Look, you're right.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.927
That thing killed those people,
our friends.

42:32.027 --> 42:35.510
- Yeah.
- But you need to get in line.

42:35.810 --> 42:40.207
There's bigger things in play,
and this is my town.

42:40.750 --> 42:44.108
Give me a hand. Can't just leave it
in the back of your pickup.

42:44.208 --> 42:47.020
Why not? I killed this thing.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.310
- Yeah, you got a permit?
- What?

42:49.410 --> 42:52.300
- Didn't think so.
- For a dinosaur?

42:52.400 --> 42:55.642
Yeah, I hate to see you
locked up on poaching charges.

42:56.030 --> 42:58.940
Look, I don't know what protocol is
for something like this,

42:59.040 --> 43:01.594
- but letting you keep it sure ain't it.
- All right.

43:01.694 --> 43:04.507
- Give me a hand.
- Fine, fine!

43:07.120 --> 43:09.113
- Watch it!
- Or what?

43:09.213 --> 43:11.506
What else can happen to it?

43:12.150 --> 43:15.627
You are really getting on my nerves.

43:22.590 --> 43:23.860
How'd you kill it?

43:23.960 --> 43:28.000
See, I tracked this thing
with a methane detector.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.000
Found a piece of skin
in the back of the mine.

43:31.100 --> 43:33.737
Smelled of sulfur and gas.

43:34.478 --> 43:36.164
It looked...

43:36.840 --> 43:39.370
It looked like it crawled
through the rubble.

43:39.670 --> 43:43.019
- How many of them are there?
- Oh, there was plenty...

43:43.919 --> 43:48.550
but I lost count. I lost count
when they started eating all my friends.

43:48.740 --> 43:51.940
All right, look,
I'll go back to the mine,

43:52.040 --> 43:56.217
I'll talk to Marcus,
get the demo shut down.

43:56.490 --> 43:59.037
It's gonna be the end
of this town, though.

44:03.130 --> 44:05.070
All right, here we go.

44:05.170 --> 44:07.137
Charges are set.

44:07.540 --> 44:09.567
Fire in the hole!

44:15.380 --> 44:18.320
He was right. It's completely hollow.

44:18.420 --> 44:22.457
All right, boys, let's get some excavators
up in there and clean her out.

44:42.870 --> 44:46.969
Sinclair, airport. Now!

44:48.710 --> 44:50.050
We're too late.

44:50.150 --> 44:53.950
Damn it. Gotta get back to the mine,
see what happened, okay?

44:54.050 --> 44:57.077
All right, I'll check with County
and meet you back there.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.954
Get ahold of County
and see if they felt anything.

45:17.054 --> 45:19.655
Sheriff, you're not gonna
believe this, but...

45:19.755 --> 45:22.096
the line's flooded
with animal attack reports.

45:22.196 --> 45:23.898
- What?
- From all over the place.

45:23.998 --> 45:26.039
I don't know what to make of it.

45:26.520 --> 45:29.620
Hey, Pa, come on, get up.
Something's going on.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.827
The grid's completely out.

45:32.650 --> 45:33.690
What do we do?

45:33.790 --> 45:37.087
Look, just keep trying to get the line
back up. Stay on your walkie.

45:38.052 --> 45:39.572
Wait...

45:39.672 --> 45:41.327
We gotta get out of here.

45:43.420 --> 45:46.637
- Where the hell are you going?
- Hunting.

45:46.740 --> 45:48.246
Hey...

45:48.846 --> 45:51.169
will you check on Sky?

45:51.680 --> 45:56.380
- Will you make sure she's okay?
- Boy, she's none of your damn business.

45:56.480 --> 46:00.750
Look, Henry, you gotta get me
out of here. I can help.

46:00.850 --> 46:03.550
The last thing I need
is a hothead running around town.

46:03.650 --> 46:05.890
Come on, Henry! Let him help you.

46:06.090 --> 46:08.732
You must be out of your mind.

46:09.630 --> 46:14.914
Hey, Henry. Hen...
What did she mean by animal attacks?

46:56.610 --> 46:59.158
You know how to use one of these things?

46:59.980 --> 47:01.490
Yeah.

47:01.590 --> 47:03.487
Good girl.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.530
How are we gonna explain this?

47:10.630 --> 47:15.046
Look, just get me out of this town
if you know what's good for you, Sinclair.

47:17.590 --> 47:18.997
What the...

47:21.130 --> 47:22.997
Oh, my God.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.507
Go.

47:27.770 --> 47:29.447
Go!

47:41.790 --> 47:45.509
Funny thing is this is probably
the safest place as any.

47:46.790 --> 47:49.835
Animal attacks? Come on, man.

47:51.060 --> 47:53.830
You need to relax, son.
You can't do nothing from in here.

47:53.930 --> 47:58.320
I need to get out of here.
I gotta check on Sky.

47:58.420 --> 48:00.217
Sky.

48:03.810 --> 48:07.532
- What happened to you that day?
- What do you mean?

48:07.632 --> 48:11.287
You know what happened.
I got bucked, had a wreck.

48:11.387 --> 48:14.629
- I got stomped.
- Not that day.

48:16.190 --> 48:19.708
- You mean the day I left?
- Yeah, that day.

48:20.108 --> 48:23.490
- What happened to you?
- You wanna talk about this now?

48:23.590 --> 48:24.827
Come on.

48:29.830 --> 48:33.300
- Talk to me.
- I got angry, and I panicked.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.210
- You panicked.
- She was putting me out.

48:36.310 --> 48:40.554
I was gonna lose her.
I was gonna lose everything.

48:42.310 --> 48:44.247
I messed up.

48:45.980 --> 48:48.520
Messed up. "I messed up!"

48:48.620 --> 48:50.632
That don't work, boy.

48:50.732 --> 48:53.872
I was hoping you'd learned
something in your travels.

48:59.330 --> 49:01.175
You know...

49:01.275 --> 49:03.135
you can forgive yourself.

49:03.535 --> 49:07.118
She bound to be able
to forgive you someday.

49:07.870 --> 49:09.877
Think about it.

49:10.240 --> 49:14.390
I don't know if I can forgive myself.

49:15.380 --> 49:18.697
Well, then how the hell could she?

49:20.620 --> 49:22.687
You know, I've been...

49:23.990 --> 49:28.797
I've been running for so long
and for so far,

49:30.060 --> 49:32.300
I forgot what I was running from.

49:32.400 --> 49:36.297
You know, it wasn't Sky, it wasn't you.

49:37.170 --> 49:39.237
It was myself.

49:40.300 --> 49:42.377
You know what these are?

49:43.210 --> 49:47.866
The smallest violins playing
the saddest song in the world.

49:51.410 --> 49:53.607
I love you, boy.

49:54.250 --> 49:56.416
I need a drink.

50:10.823 --> 50:12.607
I don't like this shit at all.

50:18.580 --> 50:21.121
Can anyone see out the window?

50:38.200 --> 50:40.953
What are you doing, Sinclair?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.067
Oh, God.

50:56.680 --> 50:59.847
Val, be still.
That thing is still in here, man.

51:01.520 --> 51:04.608
What are you doing?
He's gonna get in here, Val. Val!

51:04.708 --> 51:07.797
Do not open the door. Not cool.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.730
Val...

51:17.245 --> 51:20.909
Val, this is not safe in here, man!

51:21.270 --> 51:23.810
- Oh, good grief.
- You coming?

51:23.910 --> 51:27.427
Man, an old drunk ain't gonna
be no help to you, buddy.

51:30.310 --> 51:33.220
Don't leave with the keys.
Don't leave with the keys.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.485
Val, go get her.

51:46.500 --> 51:49.615
Oh, this is not fun. This is not fun.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.737
Run!

52:07.220 --> 52:08.857
Go.

52:44.300 --> 52:46.190
Don't stop. I want no stops.

52:46.290 --> 52:49.091
I want you to get me
to the airport now...

52:57.630 --> 52:59.507
Oh, my God.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.177
Well done, dear boy. Well done.

53:27.910 --> 53:31.817
Now, either one of you care to explain
what the hell is going on?

53:33.640 --> 53:34.870
Well?

53:34.970 --> 53:38.410
Don't look at me.
Ask the resident expert here.

53:38.510 --> 53:41.116
I'm just a simple businessman.

53:41.410 --> 53:43.329
Don't you dare point the finger at me.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.920
I told you not to order the blast,
and you did it anyway.

53:46.020 --> 53:50.997
I think you have it all wrong, my dear.
You signed the blast order, not me!

53:51.590 --> 53:54.089
- Don't you dare point...
- Hey.

53:54.690 --> 53:57.436
That is not gonna help anything!
You are finished!

53:57.536 --> 53:59.338
- I am not finished!
- Stop!

53:59.438 --> 54:02.375
All right, shut up!

54:04.430 --> 54:08.714
Joe, I want you to shore up this door
with everything you've got.

54:09.140 --> 54:11.067
Who put you in charge?

54:11.840 --> 54:14.237
You got a better idea?

55:12.470 --> 55:14.410
Sky, you okay?

55:14.810 --> 55:17.040
- Yeah.
- All right, come on, let's go.

55:17.340 --> 55:22.280
- No, I can't, I can't.
- You can, okay? Come on, we gotta go.

55:22.380 --> 55:25.270
No. What are those things?
What's happening?

55:25.370 --> 55:27.212
I don't have a reasonable
explanation for it,

55:27.312 --> 55:29.950
but I'm telling you this,
we gotta go, and we gotta go now.

55:30.050 --> 55:31.325
'Cause they're gonna come back.

55:31.425 --> 55:35.460
Can't we just use a phone in the restaurant,
and we can call for help?

55:35.560 --> 55:37.587
The phones are dead.

55:39.030 --> 55:42.437
- Wait, you came back here for me?
- I did.

55:42.700 --> 55:44.797
Why would you do that?

55:46.270 --> 55:48.567
What choice did I have?

55:49.010 --> 55:51.525
I had to make sure you were safe.

55:53.840 --> 55:57.007
We need to call the sheriff.
He'll know what to do.

55:59.050 --> 56:03.734
There's a CB in the storeroom, and we can
contact him on that, okay? Let's go.

56:03.834 --> 56:04.881
Come on.

56:12.930 --> 56:14.600
You.

56:14.700 --> 56:17.027
Yes, you.

56:21.070 --> 56:23.237
What's your name?

56:24.270 --> 56:27.422
Quaid. My name's Quaid.

56:28.810 --> 56:31.487
Right. Quaid.

56:40.090 --> 56:44.187
So, Quaid, you got a vehicle near here?

56:44.790 --> 56:49.476
Yeah. She's out the diner,
a few blocks up.

56:51.130 --> 56:53.040
All right.

56:53.140 --> 56:56.707
If you can get
your truck down here, Quaid,

56:57.370 --> 57:01.213
I'll give you any amount of money
that you want.

57:03.780 --> 57:06.349
Within reason, of course.

57:10.390 --> 57:12.527
A million bucks.

57:13.290 --> 57:15.517
Million bucks.

57:21.430 --> 57:24.694
All right, a million bucks.

57:24.794 --> 57:27.540
You get your truck back here,

57:27.940 --> 57:31.999
and I will give you a million dollars.

57:32.410 --> 57:34.880
You old wrinkly bag of dung.

57:34.980 --> 57:39.520
You know good and well
that going out these doors is suicide.

57:39.620 --> 57:41.886
And what's a human life worth to you?

57:41.986 --> 57:45.890
- A million bucks?
- Hell, I'll do it for a million bucks.

57:45.990 --> 57:48.287
No, you won't!

57:48.460 --> 57:51.830
Ain't no one gonna stick
their neck out for this jerk.

57:51.930 --> 57:56.670
I told you. I told you what was
down there, and you didn't listen.

57:56.770 --> 58:02.177
And now you're gonna pay for it
in this life or the next.

58:15.950 --> 58:20.816
Hello? Hello, can anyone hear me?
Hello? Over.

58:25.390 --> 58:27.297
Hello.

58:31.230 --> 58:34.378
Val, things are never gonna be
the way that they were.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.878
I don't want them to be
the way they were.

58:38.470 --> 58:41.729
Well, is this what you imagined
coming back here?

58:48.750 --> 58:53.590
Hello. Hello, can anyone hear me?
Hello? Over.

58:53.690 --> 58:56.227
Sky, honey, is that you?

58:56.790 --> 58:58.760
- <i>Henry!</i>
- Sky, are you there?

58:58.860 --> 59:01.430
Yes, Henry, it's me. Hi, hey.

59:01.930 --> 59:07.470
- God, baby, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm at the diner, and I'm with Val.

59:07.970 --> 59:12.577
- Are you hurt?
- No, nothing serious.

59:12.677 --> 59:15.610
- <i>Henry, what happened?</i>
- The whole town's under attack.

59:16.310 --> 59:18.680
<i>Something came out of the mine.</i>

59:18.780 --> 59:21.507
<i>Is your location secure?</i>

59:21.720 --> 59:23.187
Give me that.

59:23.750 --> 59:25.590
<i>Henry, this is Val.</i>

59:25.690 --> 59:29.060
Our location is severely compromised.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.630
Okay, we gotta go. How's your location?

59:31.730 --> 59:34.860
It's not good. We're...
We're getting low on ammo,

59:34.960 --> 59:37.400
<i>and those things have us
completely surrounded.</i>

59:37.500 --> 59:41.937
Is that Val Walker? The Val Walker?

59:44.270 --> 59:47.755
Let me talk to him, Henry.
I know him. Come on.

59:51.110 --> 59:54.520
- <i>Val, is that you?</i>
- Yeah. Who is this?

59:55.020 --> 59:57.690
It's Quaid. You remember me?

59:57.790 --> 01:00:02.130
- <i>We worked together as hands for Lou.</i>
- Yeah, Quaid. How you doing?

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.160
<i>I've seen better days, friend.</i>

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.796
Look, we're in a real pickle down here
at the bar. What's your location?

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:14.134
- I'm at the... I'm at the diner with Sky.
- <i>Is there anyone left alive?</i>

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.070
Doesn't look like it.

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:19.140
Okay, this is what I want you to do.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.145
I want you to go out of the back
of the diner. Look to the left of the alley.

01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:25.080
You're gonna see my orange
pickup truck. You can't miss it.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.820
Now, underneath the driver's seat
is a kill switch.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.690
Look at the column,
and you'll see the black and red wire.

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.560
Now, you just rub 'em together, okay?
You rub 'em together.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.919
And you and Sky,
you get the hell out of here.

01:00:37.019 --> 01:00:39.160
<i>Don't try to play hero. You got me?</i>

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.097
No!

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:43.300
No!

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.339
He comes here, and he picks me up.

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:50.993
The minute they stop,
those things will mob him.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.877
<i>What's your situation like?</i>

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.447
We'll manage.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.687
<i>Just go for help.</i>

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.187
Here.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.577
You made your bed,
and now you can die in it.

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.797
I'm sorry.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.810
Cover me.

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:29.217
You can do this, okay?

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.187
Val.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:48.437
Val!

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.824
We gotta hurry. Val, let's go!

01:01:51.924 --> 01:01:54.323
Come on, Val, hurry! Let's go!

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.277
Kill switch!

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.536
That's it.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.310
Val, there's nobody here.

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:14.280
Come on. Those boys ain't gonna make it
the next hour without some help.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.817
Nearest town's four hours away.

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.367
Where did all this come from?

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.440
Quaid. He's an anarchist at heart.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.307
You know, I bet he's actually
enjoying this in a way.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:42.437
How can you joke like that?

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.507
Like what?

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.850
Like what? Like that.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:53.424
Half the town's dead, Val,
and you're cracking jokes.

01:03:53.524 --> 01:03:57.960
- This ain't no joke.
- No, it's not. You're a joke.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.697
You're the real joke, Val.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.170
Do you honestly think
that you're just gonna cowboy up

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.485
and ride into town guns a blazing?

01:04:06.585 --> 01:04:09.276
They said to get help.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.467
Yeah, and you're real inclined
to listen to that sheriff, ain't ya?

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:21.047
Why did you leave me?

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.987
What is wrong with you?

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.760
Three years,
and you just come waltzing back?

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.367
What did you honestly think
was gonna happen here?

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.037
What?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.062
What? I hate you!

01:04:38.162 --> 01:04:42.922
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you, Val! I hate you!

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.677
I'm sorry.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.847
I'm sorry.

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.587
What are you up to?

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:20.468
Blood is a carrier for oxygen
in us human beings,

01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:23.480
but in these reptiles that have
been living underground...

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.550
if you're right... they've had
to adapt to thriving on methane.

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:32.427
Their blood is carrying gas,
methane, propane.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.730
Okay, what's your point?

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:39.900
Well, their Achilles Heel would be where
blood is in its highest concentration.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.346
The brain and the heart. Smart.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.286
All right, Joe, get her a bottle
of high proof alcohol, whiskey,

01:05:48.386 --> 01:05:50.507
- and some rags from the bar.
- Okay.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:00.020
- How much ammo you got left?
- 10, 12 rounds.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.420
Good. Look, it's a straight shot
from here to the station,

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.990
and you've got some other cars
back there, right? Right?

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:13.230
Yeah. My deputy's car should be there,
but my deputy should still be there.

01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.300
Good.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.470
All right, this is the plan.
They got a big PA system over here.

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:22.970
I'm gonna work my way over there,
figure out how to switch it on,

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:26.540
then when the time's right,
we're gonna blast a lot of music out there,

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.850
then we're gonna hightail it out of here
back to the station, okay?

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:36.717
Look, we are going to find
your girlfriend, then get out of here.

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:39.957
What about the rest?

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:45.260
I had something like this
happened in Belize.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.430
Look, it's... it's like this.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:52.400
There's a ton of iridium in that mine.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.018
Now, anyone that helps me
now or in the future

01:06:56.118 --> 01:06:59.008
stands to be very, very rich.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.780
Unfortunately, there is going to be
some collateral damage,

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.415
but it won't be us.

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:08.447
Okay?

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.457
Okay.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.802
Remember, stay inside
and you lock the doors.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.400
Fuel line's tore out.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.966
You're history.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.437
Do you hear that?

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.407
- Maybe it's help on the way.
- Yeah.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.947
That don't sound like help to me.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:58.317
Something's coming. Focus all
your attention right down the middle.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.897
Brace yourselves. They're getting close.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.997
Who turned on the music?

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.717
Marcus! Marcus, wait!

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:23.017
Unbelievable.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:37.911
Hurry up with that thing!

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.177
- Joe! Joe! No! Joe!
- Oh, no.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.230
Move it up. We've got
to get ourselves to higher ground.

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:23.340
You got any incendiaries, tracers,
flares, anything like that?

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.510
Val, it's the gas. They light up
like fireworks if you hit 'em right.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.045
- There's some at the sheriff's station.
- Okay, let's go.

01:11:30.145 --> 01:11:33.580
Hold on. I'll go get them.
You guys head out, get to higher ground.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.077
I'll meet you at the grain elevator.
Leave those tracers to me.

01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:41.500
Come on!

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.207
Well, I'll be damned. He is back.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.907
Yo! Come on! Come on, doggie!

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.947
All right. Let's go!

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.193
Come on!

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:31.940
Oh, my God.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:36.376
Keys. Where are the keys?

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.007
Damn it.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.120
All right, now keep your sights open
and shoot anything that crawls.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.527
We're gonna secure this doorway for Val.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.840
Where's that goddamn heliport?
I know it's around here somewhere.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.677
What...

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:22.959
Hello. Can you hear me? Hello!

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:14.067
Not bad?

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:04.850
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:08.157
All right, let's move
to the high ground. Go.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.477
Help me with this.

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:27.877
We're surrounded.

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:31.450
All right, everybody,
focus all your fire on this door!

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:34.520
Wait! Sky, are you in there?

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.347
Henry!

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.160
You don't think I know what
happened back there at the bar?

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:47.400
It was Marcus. It was his idea.
I went after him.

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.730
And?

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:52.200
He's dead. He took
the deputy's car, and he's dead.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.940
What about Sinclair?

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.070
- I assumed she was with you.
- No.

01:16:56.170 --> 01:17:00.008
Well, I assume that she's dead
'cause she ain't with us.

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:02.610
We're gonna die in here.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:05.110
- We're gonna take this town back.
- How?

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:08.280
My horse, some ATVs outside,
and propane tanks.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:12.050
We rig 'em up, lead those dinosaurs
back to the mine they came from.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.090
Some of us will set up
on top of the crater rim

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:16.690
and pick them off with the tracers
one at a time as they come in.

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:20.760
Yeah. I got a few surprises for them
at the mine. Might come in handy.

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.097
Yeah. You and the sheriff's
as good a shot as any.

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:26.540
It won't work. There are too many.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.810
We got a stockpile of ammo, propane tanks.
We rig it up and draw them away.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:34.737
- What makes you think they'll follow?
- Oh, they love that stuff.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.110
- Round 'em up.
- Just like cattle.

01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:40.420
Cattle that could eat you, all right?

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.990
We stay right here,
we wait for help, end of story.

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:47.560
No. We're as good as dead if we stay here.
This is how it's gotta be!

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.287
Listen, I'm the sheriff.
What I say is the law.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.697
Are you kidding me?

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.707
These walls are hollow.
There's more of them coming up.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:19.820
You didn't lock the door behind you?

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.090
We need to sit tight and wait for help.

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:27.460
Yeah, look who's talking. Sit tight?
You ran and left us for dead.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.770
If not for Val,
we'd all be ripped to shreds.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:32.497
Now, we need to get
out of here, and now!

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.081
Come on, Val, obstruct this door.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.965
He's not a changed man.

01:19:03.065 --> 01:19:04.454
You know that.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.437
- You still love him.
- Henry...

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.420
How's it looking?

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.780
Bad.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.427
We gotta find another way out of here.

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:35.399
Let's go. I'll cover the door.

01:19:45.142 --> 01:19:47.711
They'll be coming up these floorboards.

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:58.110
Go help them. I'll hold the door.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.852
Don't you even mess with me, son.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.106
I got this. Go.

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:29.547
Look, I'll shoot you. You know I would.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.357
Go!

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:46.293
No!

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.677
I'm sorry.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.430
Where's Quaid?

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.664
What? Y'all looking for these?

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:47.287
Let's do this.

01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:50.544
Let's do it.

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.558
Quaid, open the tank!

01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:17.866
- Yeah!
- Come on! Move out!

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:15.406
Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna
sit up over there on that ridgeline.

01:23:15.506 --> 01:23:18.447
Gonna leave these propane tanks here.
I'll bring them to the canyon.

01:23:18.547 --> 01:23:22.187
I got a little something for them.
You sit there and pick 'em off one by one.

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.907
Here we go, baby.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.667
Yeah!

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:21.837
Get some! Come on, get some!

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:30.273
Get some! Yeah! Yeah!

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:35.397
Yeah! No!

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.987
It's over.

01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:30.047
It's okay, baby.
It's the other shoulder.

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:37.717
I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.327
You saved me.

01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:46.457
No, darling.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.997
You saved me.
