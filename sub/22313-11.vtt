00:06.808 --> 00:08.588
<i>Last time on superstition...</i>

00:08.616 --> 00:10.506
You should just go ahead
and live your life, Calvin.

00:10.546 --> 00:12.083
- As you wish.
- Who are you?

00:12.099 --> 00:14.711
- The dredge. Coo-coo-ca-choo.
- My mother died, too.

00:14.726 --> 00:16.661
Reflected in this,

00:16.683 --> 00:18.735
you can see stories
all around the globe.

00:18.740 --> 00:19.857
You can go on playing mayor.

00:19.868 --> 00:21.466
I'll be expecting your full support.

00:21.515 --> 00:24.468
You've been searching for that
ring for a long time, haven't you?

00:24.593 --> 00:26.868
- This ain't goodbye!
- Ahhhhh!

00:29.666 --> 00:31.141
We're not doin' this.

00:31.452 --> 00:32.784
Calvin's right.

00:32.909 --> 00:35.914
- Might only make things worse.
- It can't get any worse.

00:36.039 --> 00:37.229
It won't stop it.

00:37.307 --> 00:38.766
How do you know?

00:39.308 --> 00:40.597
I don't know.

00:40.929 --> 00:44.298
- I just have a feeling.
- Not good enough.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.181
- Easy, easy.
- Ah...

00:46.306 --> 00:49.217
All right. Nobody wants this.

00:50.179 --> 00:52.878
I didn't think vajras actually existed.

00:53.065 --> 00:54.798
What exactly is that?

00:55.007 --> 00:57.755
Hindi legend, it harnessed
the power of lightning and...

00:57.769 --> 00:59.640
Ruins days.

01:01.393 --> 01:02.786
The hell it won't work.

01:02.974 --> 01:04.920
You see, he agrees.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.628
- No, I don't.
- Put it down, mayor.

01:06.639 --> 01:08.701
She's the cause of this.

01:08.826 --> 01:10.382
I'm ending it now.

01:14.358 --> 01:16.252
Calvin!

01:17.565 --> 01:18.947
Calvin!

01:21.342 --> 01:24.433
See, I didn't wanna have to do that.

01:25.566 --> 01:27.674
Your gun won't work on me.

01:27.894 --> 01:29.563
Flee, may, as well.

01:34.352 --> 01:35.640
Go on.

01:40.540 --> 01:41.679
Okay.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.548
If you knew what was happening here,

01:45.759 --> 01:47.263
you wouldn't stop me.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.949 --> 02:02.558
It ends here.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.673
Son of a bitch!

02:22.929 --> 02:25.488
What's a six
letter word for immature?

02:25.787 --> 02:27.090
Jejune.

02:27.264 --> 02:28.994
<i>- C'est un mot franã§ais.
- Oui.</i>

02:29.210 --> 02:32.273
J-e-j-u-n-e.

02:32.317 --> 02:34.894
You are right. You
learn something new every day.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.050
Hey,

02:38.399 --> 02:40.251
nice work kickin' that jinn's butt

02:40.284 --> 02:42.479
over at the camp bridges the other day.

02:42.959 --> 02:45.188
But we've gotta set
down some rules because

02:45.313 --> 02:48.207
that ring of Solomon's the most
powerful weapon we got, son.

02:48.494 --> 02:51.281
If you bounce outta here and
you take it without telling me,

02:51.673 --> 02:53.741
we're vulnerable to attack here at home.

02:54.056 --> 02:55.587
Understood.

02:56.356 --> 02:58.093
Haven't we had this
conversation already?

02:58.123 --> 03:01.433
Hey, you guys, come have
some eggs before they get cold. Hmm?

03:02.881 --> 03:04.194
I need more.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.696
More what? You haven't even eaten yet.

03:06.821 --> 03:09.665
And tilly, I made you an omelet

03:09.682 --> 03:13.170
- with soy milk, just the way you like.
- Yay, you're reading my mind. Thank you.

03:13.198 --> 03:15.741
I planted some hydrangeas
at your mother's grave site.

03:15.774 --> 03:18.877
Thought I'd go with a more distinctive
flower than the usual lilies.

03:18.904 --> 03:20.353
That's very thoughtful of you.

03:20.773 --> 03:22.724
I feel bad about missing the service.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.825
Don't.
I mean, you were away.

03:24.897 --> 03:26.828
I'm more surprised that
aunt Nancy didn't show up.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.674
I figured she'd be there for
like moral support or something.

03:28.696 --> 03:31.422
Aunt Nancy's a trip, but
she'll show up in her own time.

03:31.931 --> 03:33.685
Eh, I'll check on her later today.

03:33.712 --> 03:35.493
But I do have an intake first.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.273
Unfortunately, Mr. Peters passed away.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.065
Really? Mr. Peters?

03:39.424 --> 03:40.806
I liked him.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.371
What happened?

03:42.609 --> 03:44.705
Well, he was
86 and ran a red light.

03:44.716 --> 03:48.137
Honestly, I feel like at a certain age,
we should just take away their keys.

03:52.593 --> 03:55.214
Oh, no, hell no, don't even look at me.

03:55.391 --> 03:57.238
Oh, was I?

03:57.255 --> 03:59.096
I didn't... did I... I didn't notice.

03:59.129 --> 04:01.053
Um, by the way, do you
mind picking him up?

04:01.086 --> 04:03.586
I'm not honestly sure what
condition he's in, but body...

04:03.688 --> 04:04.786
- Yeah, sure.
- Is that okay?

04:04.808 --> 04:08.021
Yeah, definitely. Maybe
after, I could borrow the car.

04:08.146 --> 04:09.470
Russ and I wanted to...

04:09.492 --> 04:13.091
Um, Russ and you have nothing
going on except for a date with me.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.905
I left you guys alone for two days

04:14.933 --> 04:19.411
and I am still trying to scrub up
that boy's blood from my wood floors.

04:23.868 --> 04:25.273
What's wrong?

04:26.362 --> 04:28.369
Got this little headache
that's not going away.

04:28.391 --> 04:29.757
You got a lot on your mind, baby.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.793
Maybe I need a nap, because
someone very beautiful

04:32.918 --> 04:34.361
kept me up half the night.

04:34.382 --> 04:36.207
- Guys, come on.
- Now you say that.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.528
- What, hater?
- Isaac. No one.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.602
Huh?

04:39.658 --> 04:42.134
- Mmm.
- Oh, excuse me for a second.

04:43.146 --> 04:44.350
Hastings.

04:44.411 --> 04:45.677
Are all of you okay?

04:45.802 --> 04:47.690
<i>Yeah, we're good. What's going on?</i>

04:47.712 --> 04:51.705
It's imperative that I speak
to you in person. Right now.

04:56.041 --> 05:00.929
You kids aren't ready for gravity magic.

05:00.984 --> 05:02.742
So we're gonna go back to basics, hmm?

05:02.781 --> 05:04.589
Like, driver's Ed.

05:04.666 --> 05:07.510
- Do we really have to do this?
- No, I wanna know.

05:07.986 --> 05:11.332
So everyone in this family
gets a significator card.

05:11.389 --> 05:13.247
Even you, Russ.

05:13.558 --> 05:16.612
And a significator symbolizes a dilemma

05:16.646 --> 05:18.430
or decision you're trying to decide

05:18.486 --> 05:21.264
and how and where you're
seeking resolution.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.626
So we have the empress,

05:26.204 --> 05:27.907
the hermit,

05:28.654 --> 05:30.140
the fool,

05:32.275 --> 05:33.726
justice,

05:34.722 --> 05:36.290
the emperor,

05:37.057 --> 05:39.835
- the star.
- I wanna be the star.

05:40.433 --> 05:42.819
Russ, you're the fool.

05:42.921 --> 05:45.110
It doesn't work that way.

05:46.669 --> 05:48.637
Lovers.

05:49.705 --> 05:53.376
- Then we have the devil.
- Ooh.

05:53.431 --> 05:57.009
And the devil...

05:57.059 --> 05:59.464
Why are there two devils in my deck?

06:02.173 --> 06:03.749
That's impossible.

06:05.054 --> 06:06.630
Well, what's wrong?

06:12.496 --> 06:14.729
Russ, you try it.

06:30.135 --> 06:32.184
Whoa.

06:34.291 --> 06:35.728
Okay.

07:00.932 --> 07:02.630
Whoa.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.278
These all died and head to Vegas, right?

07:05.403 --> 07:07.833
Kids, go and find Calvin.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.918
Tell him it's urgent.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.693
Now. Now.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.309
Hey.

07:44.108 --> 07:45.208
Hey.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.524
Thought you were workin' today.

07:50.148 --> 07:51.288
No.

07:51.725 --> 07:53.307
Had no food at the house.

07:54.219 --> 07:55.816
I was headed this way.
You shouda told me.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.078
- I woulda picked up a few things.
- Hey, let's not do this.

07:58.117 --> 08:00.618
- Do what? That whole knight
in shining armor thing.

08:00.627 --> 08:04.115
- Isn't that just a little bit playing?
- It's called extending a common courtesy.

08:04.137 --> 08:06.035
Yeah, but with how
many strings attached?

08:07.017 --> 08:08.246
No strings.

08:08.424 --> 08:11.425
You opted out of us trying
to rebuild, I respect that.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.909
Don't make it to be like I'm out
here tryin' to run game on you.

08:13.949 --> 08:15.772
I'm just tryin' to help
put groceries in the house

08:15.780 --> 08:17.764
that my daughter lives in. That's it.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.450
How very chivalrous of you.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.742
You might find this hard to believe,

08:22.772 --> 08:24.811
but may westbrook is resistible.

08:24.936 --> 08:26.074
Calvin.

08:28.279 --> 08:30.075
Grandma read her tarot cards and they...

08:30.097 --> 08:31.981
- They all came up evil.
- Evil.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.369
She said something
really bad's gonna happen.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.851
Okay, I've heard her armageddon
stories before. It's fine.

08:35.876 --> 08:39.102
Mr. Hastings, she's serious.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.451
Dad, I don't think
she's kidding this time.

08:42.871 --> 08:45.248
Okay. You kids head back to the house.

08:45.282 --> 08:46.961
- And stay there.
- Okay.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.566
Aunt Nancy, have you been trying to...

09:02.508 --> 09:03.928
Oh, my god.

09:04.053 --> 09:05.255
Don't touch her.

09:05.898 --> 09:07.705
What's going on?
What are you doing to her?

09:07.776 --> 09:09.931
The question is, what
is she doing to us?

09:10.056 --> 09:11.666
Okay, wait. Do you
remember anything different

09:11.670 --> 09:13.178
or unusual about the last day?

09:13.231 --> 09:14.837
Now that you mention it,

09:15.124 --> 09:16.853
I've been experiencing some déjã vu,

09:16.892 --> 09:18.976
- but a lot of people experience that, and...
- Wait, wait.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.387
Mayor bickley, what are you doing here?

09:20.512 --> 09:22.196
I've come to save us,

09:22.701 --> 09:24.364
but you're not gonna like it.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.739
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:27.796 --> 09:28.871
The hell it won't work.

09:28.937 --> 09:30.777
You see? He agrees.

09:30.817 --> 09:32.418
- No, I don't.
- No, he does...

09:34.046 --> 09:36.656
Now easy. None of us want this.

09:36.731 --> 09:38.120
What exactly is that?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.380
Vajras.

09:39.566 --> 09:41.791
In hindi legend, it
harnessed the power of...

09:41.826 --> 09:43.286
Lightening.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.952
And...

09:51.822 --> 09:54.277
- Why?
- You have to trust me, may.

09:54.445 --> 09:55.710
I have to kill her.

09:55.835 --> 09:57.664
Same goes for anyone
who gets in the way.

09:57.701 --> 09:59.199
It's for our own good.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.969
I know what you're thinking,

10:03.389 --> 10:04.720
it's rune bullets.

10:05.057 --> 10:06.804
No one else need to die.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.148
And you'll never make it.

10:13.541 --> 10:14.823
All right.

10:16.118 --> 10:17.135
You're right.

10:17.459 --> 10:18.738
Okay.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.756
God. Oh.

10:37.831 --> 10:39.233
Why did you kill them?

10:39.729 --> 10:41.657
So we can finally move on.

10:52.313 --> 10:54.087
Oh, no, what's happening?

10:54.471 --> 10:55.889
No!

11:18.979 --> 11:21.740
What is a six-letter word for immature?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.827
Jejune. It's a French word.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.739
J-e-j-u-n-e.

11:27.163 --> 11:28.849
Right. How'd you know that?

11:28.974 --> 11:31.502
I don't know. Impressive
sat verbal, I guess.

11:31.507 --> 11:32.781
Fair enough.

11:33.205 --> 11:34.310
Pop.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.146
Didn't you want to talk to me?

11:36.836 --> 11:37.986
About the ring?

11:38.973 --> 11:40.861
I thought we talked
about that yesterday.

11:41.144 --> 11:43.325
- We did?
- Yeah.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.608
Guys, come and get some
eggs before they get cold.

11:45.807 --> 11:49.116
- And, tilly, I made you...
- Omelet with soy milk

11:49.120 --> 11:52.030
and you planted hydrangeas
at my mom's grave.

11:53.109 --> 11:55.754
I did. How did you know that?

11:56.868 --> 11:58.068
Déjã vu.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.140
Wow.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.139
Okay, we clearly all need vacations.

12:04.264 --> 12:06.110
We know each other way too well.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.682
Have you heard from aunt Nancy?

12:07.807 --> 12:09.849
I would've thought she'd have
made your mother's funeral.

12:09.974 --> 12:11.539
Yeah, so did I.

12:11.725 --> 12:14.596
But I'll check on her later.
Um, I have an intake first.

12:14.976 --> 12:16.237
Mr. Peters.

12:16.281 --> 12:19.762
- He ran a red light.
- He was 86.

12:19.833 --> 12:22.493
'Cause at a certain age,
we take the keys away.

12:25.331 --> 12:26.331
What's wrong?

12:27.044 --> 12:28.658
I have a little headache.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.369
It won't go away 'cause
maybe I need a nap.

12:33.616 --> 12:35.859
This is not right.

12:39.168 --> 12:41.773
- Mayor.
- My caller ID's blocked.

12:41.898 --> 12:43.206
How'd you know it was me?

12:43.277 --> 12:44.616
I'll be right there.

12:47.553 --> 12:51.003
So everyone in the
family gets a significator card.

12:51.206 --> 12:52.666
Including you, Russ.

12:53.232 --> 12:57.213
Significator symbolizes a dilemma

12:57.230 --> 12:58.823
or decision you're trying to decide,

12:58.863 --> 13:02.158
and how and where you're
seeking resolution.

13:04.896 --> 13:08.886
Okay, we have the empress,

13:11.252 --> 13:12.743
the hermit.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.649
Uh, the fool.

13:19.511 --> 13:21.944
Then it's the justice.

13:26.004 --> 13:27.397
Justice.

13:28.366 --> 13:30.613
Russ, have you seen a
tarot card deck before?

13:30.635 --> 13:31.741
No.

13:32.506 --> 13:33.878
How'd you know that?

13:35.554 --> 13:38.111
Well, um, I don't know.

13:38.142 --> 13:39.770
What's next, Russ?

13:41.469 --> 13:42.774
The emperor.

13:45.428 --> 13:48.104
And then it's, uh... then it's the star.

13:54.102 --> 13:55.519
Then it's lovers,

14:00.286 --> 14:03.356
and uh, then it's
followed by uh, the devil,

14:03.529 --> 14:05.900
lots and lots of the devil.

14:14.056 --> 14:16.321
Kids, go and find Calvin.

14:16.896 --> 14:18.375
Tell him it's urgent.

14:36.268 --> 14:38.572
How have you been
feeling these days, Isaac?

14:38.697 --> 14:40.964
You're not a small talk kind of guy.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.815
What's up, bickley?

14:42.890 --> 14:44.801
I'm not engaging in pleasantries.

14:44.836 --> 14:47.176
I'm attempting to prove a hypothesis.

14:48.581 --> 14:50.106
How are you feeling?

14:51.295 --> 14:54.311
Other than a little headache
that's not going away,

14:54.812 --> 14:56.046
I'm good.

14:56.148 --> 15:00.037
Feels like an ice cream
brain freeze, doesn't it?

15:01.817 --> 15:03.912
No, no, no.

15:04.178 --> 15:07.252
We are utterly irredeemably screwed.

15:07.726 --> 15:09.826
What the hell did you do?

15:11.748 --> 15:14.115
What do you know about a zurvanian loop?

15:14.801 --> 15:16.222
They're extremely rare.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.869
It's like a time sand trap.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.210
I've been around for centuries

15:21.210 --> 15:22.736
and I've never encountered one.

15:22.861 --> 15:25.139
What I know is mostly through legend.

15:25.432 --> 15:27.104
Well, guess what?

15:28.987 --> 15:30.306
Come on.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.551
You and I don't experience time

15:34.653 --> 15:36.813
the same way normal people do.

15:36.938 --> 15:40.694
When time goes out of
phase, we develop symptoms.

15:40.819 --> 15:44.861
You, with your cerebellum.
Me, with my, my vision.

15:46.621 --> 15:48.168
We're stuck in a time loop,

15:48.559 --> 15:52.200
and time cascades upon
itself over and over.

15:52.325 --> 15:53.883
So I suppose you're saying

15:53.921 --> 15:56.477
we've had this
conversation multiple times?

15:56.602 --> 15:58.327
Likely many times before.

15:58.354 --> 16:00.715
Then I guess you know
what I'm gonna ask next.

16:00.732 --> 16:02.251
It wasn't me.

16:02.952 --> 16:06.799
I'm stuck here right along
with all the rest of ya.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.285
When did this start?

16:10.485 --> 16:11.993
I've been workin' on it,

16:12.655 --> 16:14.591
and I need you to be, too.

16:15.629 --> 16:17.661
Why? In case you're wrong?

16:18.332 --> 16:20.631
In case the loop starts again.

16:32.855 --> 16:35.287
Ch-ch-ch-chu.

16:36.231 --> 16:39.292
Subject is Jasper Peters,

16:39.943 --> 16:44.290
86 years old. Time of death, 8:17 P.M.

16:44.415 --> 16:46.738
Let's see what god has wrought.

16:50.295 --> 16:52.036
Hmm, and the worse for wear.

16:52.161 --> 16:54.386
Deep laceration along the
right side of the cheek,

16:54.419 --> 16:56.367
most likely due to airbag.

16:56.579 --> 16:58.533
Nose is broken.

16:59.423 --> 17:01.306
Injuries to the manubrium corpus sterni

17:01.333 --> 17:03.341
seem to be consistent
with blunt force trauma

17:03.368 --> 17:05.071
due to vehicle accident.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.896
The hell it won't work.

17:32.407 --> 17:34.969
You see? He agrees.

17:35.044 --> 17:36.711
- No, I don't.
- No, he doesn't.

17:37.395 --> 17:39.457
May. Take it easy.

17:39.766 --> 17:41.612
- No one wants...
- Wants this to happen.

17:41.872 --> 17:42.968
Of course not.

17:42.990 --> 17:45.753
You didn't think vajras existed.

17:46.385 --> 17:48.085
How do you know what that word is?

17:48.830 --> 17:50.181
I don't know.

17:50.501 --> 17:52.536
Hindi legend says that it harnesses...

17:52.558 --> 17:53.812
The power of lightening.

17:53.877 --> 17:55.245
Have a closer look.

17:58.230 --> 17:59.596
Tilly!

18:05.069 --> 18:06.636
Calvin!

18:21.323 --> 18:23.019
Calvin!

18:27.641 --> 18:29.726
It ends here.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.307
No!

19:00.710 --> 19:03.636
I planted some hydrangeas
at your mother's grave site.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.692
- <i>Calvin.</i>
- I feel bad, missing the service.

19:06.746 --> 19:11.409
<i>Save yourself. Release us,
Calvin. We mean you no harm.</i>

19:11.485 --> 19:13.527
<i>Set us free</i>.

19:13.592 --> 19:15.263
<i>Set us free</i>.

19:21.268 --> 19:22.895
Don't tell 'em our business!

19:31.244 --> 19:32.923
- Hastings.
- Isaac.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.847
I need to see you in person, right now.

19:38.215 --> 19:40.085
Who have we got?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.510
Subject is Jasper Peters.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.382
86 years old,

19:46.577 --> 19:48.097
ch-ch-ch-chu.

19:48.124 --> 19:50.079
Time of death, 8:17 P.M.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.891
Let's see what god has wrought.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.187
Deep laceration on the
right side of the cheek.

19:59.784 --> 20:01.304
His nose is broken.

20:04.211 --> 20:06.085
Injuries to the manubrium corpus sterni

20:06.096 --> 20:09.065
seem to be consistent with blunt
force trauma due to vehicle accident.

20:13.222 --> 20:14.899
What is going on?

20:30.270 --> 20:31.909
Interesting.

20:46.992 --> 20:48.398
Hey, it's tilly, where are you?

20:48.436 --> 20:49.961
<i>On my way home.</i>

20:50.145 --> 20:52.757
<i>I had this funny feeling
you were going to call.</i>

20:58.628 --> 21:01.342
Bea, there isn't much
reading on time looping.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.703
Well, there probably was at one time.

21:03.937 --> 21:05.755
With all the burning and pillaging

21:05.777 --> 21:08.909
of the great libraries of the
ancient world, there isn't much left.

21:08.969 --> 21:11.403
No, there is a demon associated

21:11.414 --> 21:14.008
with the ancient Egyptian god khonsu.

21:15.365 --> 21:17.606
He and thoth mark the passage of time.

21:18.024 --> 21:20.716
But they're not known to be malevolent.

21:23.506 --> 21:25.552
I'm sorry, I'm so tired right now.

21:25.813 --> 21:27.632
So am I.

21:28.158 --> 21:29.705
We have to keep pushing.

21:29.922 --> 21:30.992
Okay?

21:32.582 --> 21:35.171
We can sleep when we're dead.

21:35.426 --> 21:37.152
That's comforting.

21:38.824 --> 21:41.229
Wh... what about cronus?

21:41.256 --> 21:44.306
Governor of chronological time, sure.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.851
I'm not really sure how
we pissed him off, but...

21:50.532 --> 21:52.296
So bea, if you're right,

21:52.893 --> 21:55.503
and we're stuck in
some sort of time jail,

21:56.138 --> 21:58.634
do you think the world's
moved on without us?

21:59.399 --> 22:01.479
Or is this more like time
travelers life, you know,

22:01.788 --> 22:04.518
where Henry ages really slowly

22:04.551 --> 22:06.667
and then his family
and loved ones on earth

22:06.710 --> 22:09.332
just grow old and forget about him

22:09.408 --> 22:10.999
and then he disappears the night

22:11.004 --> 22:13.707
you're supposed to consummate the
marriage. Is it more like that?

22:14.977 --> 22:16.877
I hope we never find out.

22:18.966 --> 22:21.735
I've never wanted to be
so wrong about something.

22:30.473 --> 22:31.933
What is that?

22:43.955 --> 22:46.490
What is with these spider webs?

22:50.312 --> 22:52.363
Is this aunt Nancy's?

22:53.682 --> 22:56.049
What is she up to?

23:03.479 --> 23:05.700
<i>If you've reached
who you are looking for,</i>

23:06.029 --> 23:07.826
<i>you know what to do.</i>

23:10.175 --> 23:11.912
Aunt Nancy?

23:12.259 --> 23:13.692
Oh, my god.

23:19.385 --> 23:21.492
Wait, don't touch her.

23:21.758 --> 23:23.516
What's going on,
what's happening to her?

23:23.641 --> 23:25.977
Question is, what's she doing to us?

23:32.330 --> 23:34.067
Mayor bickley, what are you doing here?

23:34.507 --> 23:36.120
I've come to save us,

23:36.222 --> 23:38.018
but you're not gonna like it.

23:38.073 --> 23:39.691
Nor are you.

23:43.538 --> 23:45.802
May, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

23:45.812 --> 23:47.327
You're gonna have to trust me.

23:47.397 --> 23:48.906
It was the only way.

23:50.176 --> 23:52.967
Aunt Nancy, aunt Nancy, can you hear me?

23:53.162 --> 23:56.142
Okay, tilly, call the
paramedics, help me get her up.

23:56.733 --> 23:58.253
No.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.175
This isn't right.

24:03.647 --> 24:05.645
What do you mean? It's
obvious she is the way

24:05.677 --> 24:07.697
- for us to get out of here.
- How can you be so sure?

24:07.729 --> 24:10.085
Don't you feel in her...
The spiders, that damn rock,

24:10.112 --> 24:11.963
all of it. I feel it.
The key is right here.

24:12.408 --> 24:15.026
- Calvin, what are you doin'?
- No.

24:18.769 --> 24:20.164
May.

24:20.761 --> 24:22.113
It's okay, ma.

24:22.401 --> 24:24.165
May, you gonna shoot me now?

24:24.393 --> 24:25.738
May.

24:27.536 --> 24:28.898
Okay.

24:29.652 --> 24:31.409
This is how we're gonna end it?

24:38.656 --> 24:40.637
Oh, my god, what's happening?

24:41.207 --> 24:42.889
What's happening?

24:57.766 --> 24:59.639
It's called a zurvanian loop,

24:59.709 --> 25:03.200
named after zurvan, the god
of infinite time and space.

25:03.325 --> 25:06.119
We're repeating time in
an endless 24-hour cycle.

25:06.244 --> 25:09.425
So this moment, this meeting,
we've all been here before?

25:09.463 --> 25:11.314
Oh, yeah, multiple times.

25:11.439 --> 25:13.175
It's like that movie, <i>groundhog day.</i>

25:13.213 --> 25:15.048
Or <i> happy death day.</i>

25:15.318 --> 25:16.961
Or <i> edge of tomorrow.</i>

25:16.997 --> 25:19.206
Or episode 518 where the
enterprise was stuck in that...

25:19.233 --> 25:21.622
Yeah, yeah, look,
everybody focus, all right?

25:21.724 --> 25:24.856
Something one of us does or
something we do collectively today

25:24.894 --> 25:27.103
re triggers the event.
We start all over.

25:27.130 --> 25:29.203
Okay, how do we know what to
do and what not to do, pop?

25:29.214 --> 25:30.435
That's our riddle, son.

25:30.452 --> 25:33.443
We've probably come close to
discovering the answer multiple times.

25:33.568 --> 25:35.511
We just don't know how or when.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.829
The phone.

25:41.221 --> 25:42.367
Mayor.

25:42.806 --> 25:45.506
- It's a zurvanian loop.
<i>- It's worse than that.</i>

25:45.631 --> 25:49.070
It's imperative that I speak
with you person, right now.

26:01.216 --> 26:03.097
How you feeling these days?

26:05.468 --> 26:07.094
This is a version of hell.

26:07.219 --> 26:08.885
It's worse than Dante.

26:09.227 --> 26:11.171
It's altogether sisyphean.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.678
Now we made our way into this loop,

26:15.544 --> 26:17.077
we can make our way out.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.155
I think you should do so quickly.

26:20.182 --> 26:22.818
I'm watching my human
staff, they're wilting.

26:22.851 --> 26:25.445
With each new cycle,
their energy is drained,

26:25.488 --> 26:27.806
they're losing their
cognitive abilities.

26:29.662 --> 26:31.632
It's the same fatigue
my family's feeling.

26:31.660 --> 26:36.235
Yes. And over time, they
and everyone in la Rochelle

26:36.739 --> 26:39.730
won't have the mental
capability to save themselves.

26:40.430 --> 26:44.060
They'll be trapped in
the time loop forever.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.742
Except you and I will remain cognizant.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.452
Yeah.

26:52.805 --> 26:54.448
Yeah, that's a version of hell.

26:58.151 --> 26:59.386
Time.

27:02.721 --> 27:05.560
I know someone who's got
all the time in the world.

27:08.046 --> 27:10.678
Okay, so we're not going crazy.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.634
Going crazy would probably
be a better option.

27:14.904 --> 27:16.941
Wish I could've been
trapped in a better day.

27:18.016 --> 27:19.823
But how do we break the cycle?

27:19.861 --> 27:22.129
It would help to know how long
we've been stuck in the loop.

27:22.172 --> 27:23.888
Bea, have you found anything else?

27:24.580 --> 27:25.983
No.

27:26.721 --> 27:28.577
What about the Egyptian sand clock?

27:32.305 --> 27:34.969
It's uh, what they called hour glasses.

27:35.463 --> 27:38.926
We have one of the first from the 1300s.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.349
Wh... what does that mean?

28:04.286 --> 28:06.545
It means, if we don't break this cycle,

28:06.889 --> 28:08.310
like this sand,

28:09.859 --> 28:12.304
forever moving in the wrong direction.

28:36.619 --> 28:38.519
Did you see the hills?

28:39.683 --> 28:41.321
They're drenched in blood.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.400
How could you do such a thing?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.984
Each crimson hillside

28:47.163 --> 28:49.112
will hasten the war's end

28:49.237 --> 28:53.534
and we can all sip from
the sweet wine of liberty.

28:53.636 --> 28:56.503
All except for the poor
souls that died up there.

28:56.605 --> 29:01.672
And my men who fought
and died up there as well.

29:01.949 --> 29:06.095
The tree of liberty must be
replenished from time to time

29:06.115 --> 29:09.211
with the blood of tyrants and patriots.

29:13.722 --> 29:16.431
And how many more would
perish if I hadn't...

29:16.458 --> 29:18.195
Hadn't what? Played god?

29:18.656 --> 29:20.653
Do you know how many
people you got killed

29:20.674 --> 29:22.661
who are fighting for our freedom?

29:22.932 --> 29:24.734
And grays, too,

29:25.054 --> 29:26.944
who think we are animals.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.469
And did your behavior
show them any different?

29:31.707 --> 29:33.754
<i>I did this for us.</i>

29:36.251 --> 29:38.649
I did this so we could be settled.

29:38.774 --> 29:41.448
So you could get the
funeral home you wanted.

29:42.589 --> 29:43.917
Wait a minute.

29:44.019 --> 29:45.634
You knew I begged you,

29:46.221 --> 29:48.776
I told you not to do this.

29:49.058 --> 29:53.427
No man, even an immortal,
tells a Nancy what to do.

29:56.537 --> 29:58.589
We are two of a kind.

29:59.501 --> 30:02.041
And as we stroll into eternity

30:02.426 --> 30:03.637
together,

30:06.036 --> 30:08.233
you will come to realize

30:09.080 --> 30:10.990
the necessity of this

30:12.157 --> 30:13.829
and you'll thank me.

30:15.885 --> 30:17.133
<i> Darlin',</i>

30:18.067 --> 30:19.912
<i>I thank you right now,</i>

30:20.780 --> 30:22.571
because I have erred

30:23.212 --> 30:24.916
and you have shown me

30:26.436 --> 30:28.574
unequivocally who you are.

30:31.353 --> 30:34.669
And I would rather go
through eternity alone

30:36.438 --> 30:38.474
than spend one moment of it

30:38.826 --> 30:42.202
with the likes of a monster like you.

31:38.304 --> 31:41.615
All right, concentrate everybody.

31:41.913 --> 31:45.219
What do you remember about
today or think you remember?

31:46.467 --> 31:49.170
Uh, well, me and garvey were
walkin' through the woods.

31:49.859 --> 31:52.040
I remember may and I
in the alchemy room.

31:52.062 --> 31:53.609
Why would I be there?

31:53.674 --> 31:55.161
I was there, too.

31:55.938 --> 31:58.547
Yeah, you, you taught
us to read tarot cards.

31:58.564 --> 32:00.181
Mr. Peters died in a car accident,

32:00.192 --> 32:02.580
and I knew all the injuries on
his body before I even saw it.

32:02.890 --> 32:04.127
That doesn't make sense.

32:04.252 --> 32:05.891
Maybe your fatigue

32:06.622 --> 32:09.012
is allowing the memories
of your past time-loops

32:09.045 --> 32:10.623
to seep into your consciousness.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.449
<i> I think you come
to my office, Isaac,</i>

32:12.471 --> 32:15.462
- but why?
<i>- Was it about you?</i>

32:15.803 --> 32:17.198
Could have been.

32:17.323 --> 32:19.489
<i>But that also means that
one of us has the memory</i>

32:19.510 --> 32:20.645
<i>of how to break the cycle.</i>

32:20.677 --> 32:22.826
And the answer could
be right under our feet.

32:23.255 --> 32:25.014
We just keep walkin' by it.

32:25.024 --> 32:27.292
- Maybe a hundred times.
- May?

32:27.824 --> 32:29.078
What's wrong?

32:29.268 --> 32:31.118
I think I have a memory. I...

32:31.243 --> 32:33.312
I think I killed someone.

32:33.437 --> 32:34.902
<i>Me, too.</i>

32:37.166 --> 32:38.615
Aunt Nancy.

32:38.675 --> 32:40.509
<i> I remember talking about her.</i>

32:40.634 --> 32:42.062
Same here.

32:42.349 --> 32:43.870
Me, too.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.726
And me.

32:47.126 --> 32:48.529
And me.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.833
Garvey? Russ?

32:50.877 --> 32:52.174
No.

32:52.386 --> 32:53.786
Who's aunt Nancy?

32:53.813 --> 32:56.065
She's our most common psychic link.

32:57.683 --> 33:00.282
I think it's time we all
paid aunt Nancy a visit.

33:00.353 --> 33:03.528
Garvey, Russ, you two stay here.

33:03.827 --> 33:06.167
Any trouble jumps off,
I don't want you in it.

33:06.340 --> 33:07.605
What?

33:07.795 --> 33:10.020
- No, but what if we're a part of the solution?
- Yeah.

33:10.052 --> 33:12.701
We'll have plenty of time
to deal with that tomorrow,

33:13.027 --> 33:14.243
or the next day.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.100
- Mom?
- No.

33:22.269 --> 33:23.566
Behave.

33:32.484 --> 33:35.258
This isn't
exactly staying put.

33:35.568 --> 33:37.375
What are they gonna do? Ground us?

33:37.380 --> 33:38.748
We're all grounded.

33:40.187 --> 33:43.146
Yeah, well, being caught
in a time loop isn't so bad

33:43.156 --> 33:45.750
if it means spending
all of eternity with you.

33:47.552 --> 33:48.784
Seriously?

33:48.822 --> 33:51.264
Russ, that was so corny.

33:51.302 --> 33:52.903
I tried.

33:53.169 --> 33:56.339
Okay, but seriously,
what are they gonna do?

33:57.343 --> 33:58.732
Who cares?

33:58.759 --> 34:01.017
Russ, we get a free do-over.

34:01.055 --> 34:02.596
We can do whatever we want.

34:02.721 --> 34:04.751
We could steal the hearse
and drive off into the sunset.

34:04.772 --> 34:06.867
We could rob a bank like
uh, Bonnie and Clyde.

34:06.884 --> 34:08.344
Wait, stay right there.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.368
- What, no, garv... come on.
- One, last one, please.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.882
Please, and then I'm done. I'm done.

34:12.127 --> 34:14.120
Stop, stop, it's all...

34:14.141 --> 34:16.476
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.460
Oh, my god.

34:27.235 --> 34:29.327
Seriously, I wasn't joking earlier.

34:37.277 --> 34:40.108
If we are really stuck in a time loop,

34:41.398 --> 34:43.013
I'm glad it's with you.

34:44.931 --> 34:46.617
Looks like some
kind of memory crystal.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.288
Not like anyone I've seen.

34:51.053 --> 34:52.284
What do you all remember?

34:54.351 --> 34:56.895
I mean, I don't even
remember being here at all.

34:58.276 --> 34:59.697
I remember being here.

35:00.513 --> 35:02.324
I just don't remember why.

35:02.498 --> 35:04.269
I remember being cold.

35:05.628 --> 35:07.578
This is madness.

35:08.016 --> 35:09.714
She's the cause.

35:10.148 --> 35:11.759
And she has to be stopped.

35:11.841 --> 35:13.261
What are you gonna do, kill her?

35:13.995 --> 35:16.509
- Whatever it takes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait...

35:16.525 --> 35:17.559
Hey, we're not doing this.

35:17.602 --> 35:19.782
- Bickley.
- They're right.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.567
That could make things worse.

35:21.692 --> 35:23.026
That won't stop it.

35:23.151 --> 35:24.220
How do you know?

35:24.294 --> 35:25.306
I don't.

35:25.431 --> 35:26.948
I just have a feeling.

35:27.633 --> 35:30.911
And then we get to do
this all over again?

35:31.910 --> 35:33.360
That's not good enough.

35:33.408 --> 35:34.784
No...

35:34.815 --> 35:37.359
<i>She is not the
cause, dark soul one.</i>

35:37.377 --> 35:39.661
<i>You can remain trapped here forever</i>

35:39.735 --> 35:41.472
<i>or we can strike a bargain.</i>

35:41.480 --> 35:42.491
Who the hell is this?

35:43.268 --> 35:46.047
<i> *** my true
voice without a host,</i>

35:46.069 --> 35:48.844
<i>coo-coo-ca-choo, the
walrus has returned.</i>

35:48.852 --> 35:51.609
<i>You imprisoned me in
the ring, son of ***.</i>

35:51.649 --> 35:54.663
- The dredge. <i>
- Nnow we're closer than ever.</i>

35:55.176 --> 35:57.403
<i>You musn't dread the dredge.</i>

35:57.528 --> 36:00.070
<i>Point your ring at infernal
bickley all you want,</i>

36:00.195 --> 36:02.705
<i>it won't work in this time loop.</i>

36:02.778 --> 36:04.272
The hell it won't work.

36:04.515 --> 36:06.330
<i>I know the only way out.</i>

36:06.455 --> 36:10.931
<i>Make a deal with me or your family
will remain trapped here, forever.</i>

36:10.981 --> 36:12.348
Never.

36:14.519 --> 36:17.468
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Oh, god.

36:19.326 --> 36:20.908
No!

36:52.760 --> 36:55.405
What's a six-letter
word for immature?

36:55.530 --> 36:56.986
Jejune.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.879
<i>- C'est un mot franã§ais.
- Oui.</i>

36:59.004 --> 37:01.097
J-e-j-u-n-e.

37:01.222 --> 37:03.899
Nice to learn
something new every day.

37:04.024 --> 37:06.538
<i>The human mind has its limits.</i>

37:06.663 --> 37:09.618
<i>Your family only has days to live.</i>

37:10.005 --> 37:14.137
<i>But you, Calvin, can stop it.</i>

37:15.365 --> 37:17.081
Hey, son.

37:17.488 --> 37:21.437
Nice work kickin' that
jinn's ass at camp bridges.

37:21.562 --> 37:23.418
But we gotta set up some rules.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.427
We've had this conversation.

37:27.523 --> 37:30.243
You guys, come have some
eggs before they get cold.

37:30.508 --> 37:33.242
- Hmm?
- I need more.

37:33.303 --> 37:35.827
More? You haven't even eaten yet.

37:35.881 --> 37:40.461
Tilly, I made omelets with soy
milk, just the way you like it.

37:40.501 --> 37:42.286
Reading my mind. Thank you.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.206
Tell the mayor we don't need him.

37:50.441 --> 37:52.503
Pop, I need you to come with me.

37:57.422 --> 37:59.335
Obsidian rock.

38:00.509 --> 38:03.101
More potent than a memory crystal.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.936
- What'd she do?
- Don't touch it, pop.

38:06.839 --> 38:08.989
Step away from her.

38:10.618 --> 38:12.614
Can't do that.

38:13.977 --> 38:15.944
Then I am so sorry.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.058
Bickley.

38:19.322 --> 38:22.294
Okay, I'll do it.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.493
We have a deal? Just tell me what to do.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.194
Calvin.

38:45.144 --> 38:48.062
Oh. Hallelujah.

38:53.191 --> 38:54.955
What happened?

38:58.877 --> 39:04.331
I made what I thought
was a killer of a deal,

39:04.456 --> 39:09.223
amazing stories locked in
that rock you destroyed.

39:09.874 --> 39:11.923
But the seller booby-trapped it,

39:12.147 --> 39:14.175
froze me in a time loop.

39:14.609 --> 39:16.279
And us, too.

39:17.241 --> 39:20.949
The time loop was meant just for me,

39:21.051 --> 39:22.750
but with each cycle,

39:22.875 --> 39:25.898
it just spread farther and farther

39:25.911 --> 39:27.349
into the whole town.

39:27.383 --> 39:30.332
- I tried to send an sos.
- Spider web.

39:31.271 --> 39:32.812
The only way to

39:32.845 --> 39:35.764
stop the loop was to
destroy the property.

39:36.209 --> 39:38.326
How long have we been in the loop?

39:39.400 --> 39:40.616
Oh,

39:40.974 --> 39:43.004
what I can reckon,

39:43.243 --> 39:45.501
307 days.

39:48.568 --> 39:50.185
Almost a year.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.301
But you won't remember a
thing. When you wake up,

39:53.317 --> 39:55.250
it'll be like nothing ever happened.

39:55.472 --> 39:57.230
Time will just go on

39:57.268 --> 39:59.732
like before the loop started.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.320
Then we're free.

40:05.090 --> 40:07.342
- We're free.
- No, hold on, hold on.

40:07.918 --> 40:09.562
Who'd you make this deal with?

40:11.413 --> 40:13.518
An old friend of ours.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.564
And a new enemy of mine.

40:17.258 --> 40:20.905
That loop he trapped me
in was a repetitive memory,

40:21.758 --> 40:25.242
one that has haunted
me for over 100 years.

40:28.102 --> 40:31.652
Sometimes the past is
best left in the past.

40:57.813 --> 40:59.918
How did you know how
to break the time loop?

41:02.181 --> 41:04.379
Musta been a memory echo.

41:05.069 --> 41:06.979
I don't believe you, son.

41:08.162 --> 41:10.479
What did you do and
what did it cost you?

41:19.315 --> 41:20.797
Not now, pop.

41:41.843 --> 41:45.067
I totally forgot how long it
took to play this damn game.

41:45.105 --> 41:46.983
Well, you need to take
some time off, dad.

41:47.016 --> 41:49.529
A day's not gonna hurt you. You
got nothin' but time on your hands.

41:49.583 --> 41:52.742
Park place, that's a property.

41:52.763 --> 41:55.727
That's a bad investment.
I'm a doctor, trust me.

41:55.761 --> 41:57.871
Tilly, trust me, I do.

41:57.939 --> 42:00.734
- Yeah, I knew you'd say to that.
- Shut up, Russ.

42:00.958 --> 42:03.237
Yeah, I knew you'd say that, too.

42:09.186 --> 42:10.570
Okay.

42:12.517 --> 42:13.861
- What did... that's jail.
- Oh!

42:13.895 --> 42:15.631
- Jail.
- Jail.

42:16.737 --> 42:19.356
- Wow.
- Another incarcerated brother.

42:19.410 --> 42:21.100
On your side of the family.

42:21.225 --> 42:22.911
Okay, here we go.

42:23.895 --> 42:27.484
<i>Looks like you should
purchase the park place.</i>

42:29.017 --> 42:31.941
<i>Insight is 20/20.</i>

42:32.490 --> 42:35.034
You stroke a bargain with me, Calvin,

42:35.374 --> 42:37.877
<i>I'll soon demand repayment.</i>
