00:04.278 --> 00:05.862
Sara was using Babylon?

00:05.863 --> 00:07.142
This is my case file.

00:07.143 --> 00:09.333
You used me to get to Bubonic.

00:09.334 --> 00:11.005
Pretending to have
information about her sister.

00:11.006 --> 00:12.117
Who said I was pretending?

00:12.118 --> 00:13.645
You and me, it's over.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.565
I need you to just
be there for me right now.

00:15.566 --> 00:16.693
She's up to something.

00:16.694 --> 00:17.639
Lindy's jacket.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.499
And she's dating
Lindy's matches.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.268
I'm Tessa.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.815
How many you say?

00:24.816 --> 00:25.855
Over a million.

00:26.256 --> 00:29.063
That's like 300 years of
bodies buried here.

00:29.064 --> 00:30.359
That's too many, man.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.919
That means the soil
of this island is made

00:32.920 --> 00:35.351
from the unclaimed
dead of New York.

00:36.215 --> 00:39.774
You'll see.
You just become numb.

00:39.775 --> 00:41.768
I don't even think about
'em no more.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.367
The hardest part is the babies.

00:45.551 --> 00:48.223
Boxes so light you think
there's nothing in them.

00:51.691 --> 00:53.123
Makes you wonder.

00:53.124 --> 00:55.723
All those lost little innocents.

00:56.971 --> 01:00.083
If there's a boy inside
or maybe a girl.

01:00.384 --> 01:02.687
Who she was gonna grow up to be.

01:02.988 --> 01:04.562
All alone now.

<i>Sounds like drain pipes to me.</i>

01:50.967 --> 01:53.069
Yeah, well, it smells
real bad and I can't have it

01:53.070 --> 01:54.309
wafting up into the club.

01:54.310 --> 01:55.493
Don't worry.

01:55.494 --> 01:57.196
All plumbing systems
develop clogs.

01:57.197 --> 01:58.768
There's simply no
way of avoiding it.

01:58.769 --> 02:01.377
No, I had most of it upgraded
about a year ago.

02:02.877 --> 02:04.229
It's in there.

02:06.529 --> 02:07.745
Yeah, that's bad.

02:08.346 --> 02:11.359
Um... forgive me if I wait here.

02:23.302 --> 02:24.591
Everything okay?

02:26.160 --> 02:27.290
What?!

02:27.927 --> 02:29.078
Where are you going?

03:05.213 --> 03:06.449
Want some juice?

03:06.850 --> 03:08.553
No.

03:10.355 --> 03:11.881
I found my case file.

03:11.882 --> 03:13.258
I know.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.917
Tommy called me.

03:16.553 --> 03:18.533
You were hoping he wouldn't?

03:18.534 --> 03:21.233
What do you know about
my sister's abduction?

03:22.343 --> 03:24.551
Three years ago, several
girls went missing

03:24.552 --> 03:27.343
in the northeast all around
the same age as your sister.

03:28.044 --> 03:30.599
The van was spotted at a couple
of the abduction sites.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.452
And you think Sara
was one of them?

03:32.997 --> 03:34.957
They found six girls total.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.428
One of them claims there was
a seventh girl in prison

03:38.429 --> 03:41.060
next to her whose name was
Sara but none of the others

03:41.061 --> 03:42.507
could corroborate this.

03:42.508 --> 03:43.780
Why didn't you tell me?

03:43.781 --> 03:45.739
Nothing was definitive.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.292
Why?!

03:49.219 --> 03:53.063
The girl who talked
about Sara... is my niece.

03:53.664 --> 03:55.100
Mary Robertson.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.564
That's how we knew about
this case.

03:56.565 --> 03:58.435
She was abducted walking home

03:58.436 --> 04:00.496
from her summer job
as a waitress.

04:00.497 --> 04:02.256
Missing for nine months.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.504
What did you do?

04:04.505 --> 04:06.296
I made it personal.

04:06.297 --> 04:09.384
I used the entire power
of the Cyber Unit to find her.

04:09.866 --> 04:12.403
I diverted funds, manpower,
equipment...

04:12.404 --> 04:14.754
anything to discover
even the slightest clue.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.060
You broke the law.

04:17.035 --> 04:18.346
I broke the law.

04:18.346 --> 04:20.635
And that's why you
didn't tell me?

04:21.036 --> 04:22.466
For nine months, I saw

04:22.467 --> 04:24.995
how that waiting tore
my family apart.

04:25.396 --> 04:29.026
How false hope destroyed
them even more.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.531
When we didn't find Sara, I
truly believed it was a dead end.

04:32.532 --> 04:34.482
You had no right to
keep this from me.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.051
Don't you see, this is
how I found you.

04:37.052 --> 04:38.752
It wasn't because of your
crimes as a hacker.

04:38.753 --> 04:41.351
It was because of your quest
to find your sister.

04:41.352 --> 04:42.710
So you could use me.

04:43.846 --> 04:46.462
I needed you focused on
catching the Flirtual killer.

04:46.463 --> 04:47.839
How could you?

04:47.840 --> 04:50.326
I'll do anything to
catch the bad guy.

04:51.227 --> 04:52.358
Here.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.751
You'll wanna hear the story
from Mary yourself.

04:56.663 --> 04:57.855
It's not a pleasant one.

05:01.267 --> 05:05.382
For what it's worth...
I hope you find your sister.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.810
Sophia, Sophia, where are you?

05:16.607 --> 05:18.647
Hey. Are you okay?

05:18.648 --> 05:20.754
No, how could I possibly
be okay?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.067
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

05:22.068 --> 05:23.690
The body has been here
for a couple of weeks.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.833
Connor?

05:25.134 --> 05:26.134
Yeah?

05:26.135 --> 05:27.726
Why are you looking at me
like that?

05:29.423 --> 05:32.478
Connor, we...
We found his wallet.

05:32.579 --> 05:35.178
His? His who?

05:36.947 --> 05:38.790
Oliver Stewart.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.903
We think he's been down here
since the Reconnoiter event.

05:42.404 --> 05:44.203
He was your date, right?

05:45.104 --> 05:46.614
My God.

05:46.615 --> 05:47.870
I'm gonna need you to

05:47.871 --> 05:49.678
come in and answer a few
questions, all right?

05:59.627 --> 06:02.586
I... I really thought
he was just blowing me off.

06:03.795 --> 06:05.590
It's gonna be okay.

06:10.946 --> 06:11.794
Shaw.

06:11.795 --> 06:14.204
<i>Sargent,
we found another victim at IRL.</i>

06:14.405 --> 06:16.124
<i>He was in the basement.</i>

06:17.999 --> 06:19.582
I'll be right there.

07:02.215 --> 07:03.543
Help!

07:13.838 --> 07:15.215
Tessa?

07:16.396 --> 07:18.266
<i>Tessa, is that you?</i>

07:19.451 --> 07:21.163
Just a minute.

07:22.068 --> 07:23.483
<i>Are you okay?</i>

07:25.612 --> 07:27.173
I'm fine.

07:43.424 --> 07:45.515
Just nursing a major hangover.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.032
Didn't you just get home?

07:47.033 --> 07:49.183
Right, I guess
it's not a hangover then.

07:49.184 --> 07:50.548
I'm still hung.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.260
Wow, you're really warm.

07:53.261 --> 07:54.269
You know me.

07:54.270 --> 07:56.956
I'm always warm.
I just need sleep.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.961
You don't look so hot yourself.

08:00.962 --> 08:02.296
What's going on?

08:02.297 --> 08:04.216
Don't try and change
the subject.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.900
I'm fine.

08:07.901 --> 08:09.788
I'm really worried about you.

08:57.148 --> 08:59.364
I'm sorry, we're turning
over our exhibit.

08:59.365 --> 09:01.192
We're not open at the moment.

09:01.193 --> 09:04.140
You're Mary, aren't you?

09:05.532 --> 09:06.976
Who are you?

09:13.396 --> 09:15.340
I never saw her face.

09:15.341 --> 09:17.620
I knew she'd be beautiful.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.784
They found six of us.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.759
We were kept in
some kind of basement.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.016
In boxes.

09:27.017 --> 09:29.619
Later I found out they were
dog kennels.

09:33.199 --> 09:35.562
<i>Sara was in the kennel next to mine.</i>

09:36.263 --> 09:40.418
<i>And we could slip our hands
in between the bars in front</i>

09:40.419 --> 09:42.447
<i>and hold on to one another.</i>

09:44.219 --> 09:45.634
What's that?

09:47.387 --> 09:50.811
We tattooed our wrists
with our names.

09:52.916 --> 09:54.646
Three more letters to go.

09:56.418 --> 09:58.271
We didn't wanna be erased.

09:58.672 --> 10:01.766
If we died, we wanted people
to know who we were.

10:02.974 --> 10:04.631
He'd...

10:05.032 --> 10:06.895
Come to us at night.

10:09.167 --> 10:11.743
He gave us pills to
keep us quiet.

10:12.944 --> 10:16.998
The worst was you'd desperately
wish he'd pick someone else instead.

10:16.999 --> 10:19.258
More often than not, he would.

10:21.247 --> 10:24.863
The doctors said when they found
us, we were addicted to pain killers.

10:26.594 --> 10:28.522
Sara, are you okay?

10:28.970 --> 10:30.650
Sara, give me your hand.

10:30.829 --> 10:32.027
How come you're so cold?

10:32.028 --> 10:34.245
Help, something's wrong!
She's got no pulse!

10:34.246 --> 10:35.481
What, what is it?

10:35.482 --> 10:36.770
Sara, something's wrong.

10:36.771 --> 10:38.537
I think she's dying.

10:38.572 --> 10:39.376
No!

10:39.411 --> 10:41.301
No, girl! No!

10:41.360 --> 10:46.426
He grabbed her and,
in the panic, he left his keys.

10:52.214 --> 10:53.286
<i>I didn't look back.</i>

10:53.287 --> 10:56.710
<i>I was so scared.</i>

10:57.983 --> 11:00.311
<i>It was three days
before Christmas.</i>

11:01.114 --> 11:03.032
<i>December 22nd.</i>

11:03.433 --> 11:06.134
<i>I don't know how but I know
the police packed</i>

11:06.135 --> 11:10.135
<i>the animal shelter
and never found him.</i>

11:12.478 --> 11:14.595
They never found Sara.

11:19.383 --> 11:24.627
I think Sara saved her pills
until she couldn't take it anymore.

11:26.255 --> 11:28.734
I'm sorry I couldn't save her.

11:28.835 --> 11:32.562
She died and I got to escape.

11:32.563 --> 11:34.667
I'm... I'm sorry.

11:36.203 --> 11:39.066
You're the first person
to give me any real information

11:39.067 --> 11:40.667
about my sister.

11:40.668 --> 11:42.402
But she's dead.

11:43.162 --> 11:44.754
I can't accept that.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.111
Not until I know for sure.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.740
- Hey, I'm...
- Shh.

12:04.084 --> 12:05.404
Is Connor okay?

12:05.405 --> 12:07.224
No, he's not okay.

12:07.225 --> 12:08.207
Where have you been?

12:08.208 --> 12:10.608
I had some personal stuff
that I had to deal with.

12:10.609 --> 12:13.336
The killer put a body
in the basement of my club.

12:13.337 --> 12:14.712
That's pretty personal.

12:14.713 --> 12:15.967
I'm sorry, I'm here now.

12:15.968 --> 12:21.439
Okay, look... this is gonna
sound really weird, but I think...

12:21.928 --> 12:25.207
Well, actually, I know
Tessa has been going out

12:25.208 --> 12:28.030
on dates with all of your
matches from Flirtual.

12:29.398 --> 12:30.559
What?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.661
Every single one.

12:33.590 --> 12:36.590
She's been wearing your clothes,
dating your matches.

12:38.914 --> 12:40.726
How long have you known this?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.149
I have been racking my brain.

12:43.150 --> 12:46.214
But it all became clear when I
found Oliver's body this morning.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.126
She's obsessed with...

12:49.127 --> 12:51.177
With the person who's
obsessed with me.

12:51.178 --> 12:52.557
Yes.

12:52.558 --> 12:54.470
Why would she do that?

12:54.471 --> 12:56.218
It doesn't make any sense.

12:56.219 --> 12:58.842
It's like this girl has got
a death wish.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.030
Do that thing.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.522
Do that thing on her phone
that helps us track her,

13:03.523 --> 13:06.538
that way we always know where she is
and I can make sure that she's safe.

13:06.739 --> 13:08.585
Yeah, of course.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.478
Thank you.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.787
<i>Dr. Taylor to OR</i>
<i>Dr. Taylor to OR</i>

13:29.547 --> 13:30.767
Hey.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.956
Will she be okay?

13:31.957 --> 13:32.912
She's stable.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.580
The doctor said
we'll have to wait and see.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.803
What happened?

13:47.270 --> 13:48.534
No.

13:48.535 --> 13:50.278
We're gonna find him.

13:50.279 --> 13:51.806
Then find him.

13:52.908 --> 13:54.492
Lindy, look...

13:54.527 --> 13:56.077
I'm sorry.

13:56.078 --> 13:58.837
Okay, I'm sorry
for what he's done,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.845
but I have something really
important I need to deal with.

14:00.846 --> 14:02.861
More important than
finding who this animal is?

14:03.362 --> 14:04.741
Lindy, please.

14:05.042 --> 14:07.564
Tommy, I can't trust you
anymore.

14:10.628 --> 14:12.237
And it's her fault.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.612
And it's your fault.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.873
They found a girl who was
left at Queen Central Hospital

14:26.874 --> 14:28.688
two Miles from
the abduction site.

14:29.649 --> 14:33.633
She died soon after from
an overdose of pain killers.

14:33.634 --> 14:37.406
Listed as Jane Doe.
Number 30-34.

14:37.407 --> 14:39.405
How did you get this
information?

14:39.406 --> 14:41.941
It was him... the killer.

14:41.942 --> 14:43.472
Then it might not be real.

14:43.473 --> 14:46.100
He just revealed to me what
Catherine was hiding all along.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.821
I just... I need to know
who this girl was.

14:49.022 --> 14:52.084
Her reports say that she was
buried on Hart Island.

14:53.161 --> 14:54.798
I have a connection to
a firm that does some

14:54.799 --> 14:58.565
pro Bono work for families with
relatives buried on the island.

14:58.566 --> 14:59.893
Let me give a call.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.205
Thanks.

15:04.881 --> 15:05.554
Look out!

15:07.337 --> 15:10.505
My God! Jake, are you okay?

15:10.706 --> 15:12.313
What the hell you doing, buddy?!

15:12.314 --> 15:13.961
Yeah, it was...
Sorry, it was my fault.

15:13.962 --> 15:15.537
Watch where you're going.

15:18.922 --> 15:20.266
Thanks.

15:23.314 --> 15:25.053
There's nothing else to say.

15:25.054 --> 15:28.413
We met off Flirtual,
went on a couple dates,

15:28.414 --> 15:32.330
and he ended up strangled in
the basement of my friend's club.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.329
How much do you know
about the Babylon portal?

15:35.930 --> 15:40.877
Enough to know that it's the definition of
human depravity and desperation.

15:41.685 --> 15:44.687
Well, the killer used
Babylon to buy Lindy.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.869
That's our best link
to catch him.

15:47.870 --> 15:50.014
It took some digging,
but we found Babylon's

15:50.015 --> 15:52.645
big coin wallet listed on
a website belonging to a

15:52.646 --> 15:54.542
law firm in the Cayman Islands.

15:57.174 --> 15:58.906
Read the list of clients.

16:02.906 --> 16:04.937
Hamish Stone Publications.

16:05.738 --> 16:07.450
What are you implying?

16:07.451 --> 16:08.879
We think Hamish...

16:08.880 --> 16:11.653
Your boss is behind
the Babylon portal.

16:13.662 --> 16:14.997
You think this is funny?

16:14.998 --> 16:16.814
It's a little farfetched.

16:16.815 --> 16:19.029
If I can get inside and
we can order onto Hamish's

16:19.030 --> 16:22.078
servers, we may be able
to find the killer's real identity.

16:22.079 --> 16:24.830
No.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.118
No, I can't help you. I'm sorry.

16:29.119 --> 16:30.798
I value my job.

16:30.799 --> 16:33.046
Next you'll be saying,
"Hamish is the killer."

16:35.936 --> 16:37.264
What is that?

16:37.265 --> 16:39.283
It's Oliver's autopsy report.

16:40.443 --> 16:42.971
He didn't die peacefully,
I can tell you that.

16:43.924 --> 16:45.539
That's not fair.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.147
We can finally get
the killer, Connor.

16:51.199 --> 16:52.587
Okay.

16:54.299 --> 16:55.884
But if anyone asks...

16:57.308 --> 16:59.620
I did it for the story.

16:59.921 --> 17:01.848
You can't just go to
Hart Island.

17:01.849 --> 17:03.847
You have to petition
the State to visit.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.152
And even then, they won't
let you near the grave.

17:06.153 --> 17:08.008
Are you sure you have
time to do this?

17:08.009 --> 17:11.638
Yeah, of course I do.
It's important.

17:12.943 --> 17:14.103
Thank you.

17:14.979 --> 17:16.935
The records aren't
digitized but come with

17:16.935 --> 17:18.799
a photograph of the deceased.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.440
It'll tell us if it's your
sister or not.

17:23.016 --> 17:24.175
Okay.

17:24.176 --> 17:25.864
All right, I'll be right back.

17:29.305 --> 17:32.096
So I called about Hart Island
burial records.

17:32.097 --> 17:33.484
Yes, of course.

17:38.522 --> 17:39.770
That's them? Thank you.

17:57.674 --> 17:58.794
Ready?

18:01.662 --> 18:04.390
They say not knowing
is the worst part, but...

18:05.398 --> 18:07.014
This feels worse.

18:07.015 --> 18:08.726
Then we'll do it together.

18:29.154 --> 18:30.175
Hold on.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.675
Here it is.

18:31.976 --> 18:33.634
30-32.

18:35.962 --> 18:37.526
30-33.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.006
30-34.

18:44.007 --> 18:46.526
There's supposed to be
a photo of Jane Doe.

18:46.858 --> 18:50.122
- 30-34.
- Who would take that?

18:50.523 --> 18:52.034
The killer.

18:53.114 --> 18:54.662
The killer was here.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.569
You have a choice here.

19:02.701 --> 19:05.845
You petition the State to
exhume the body and wait months or...

19:05.846 --> 19:07.228
Or?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.645
It's the weekend tomorrow.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.070
The island will be deserted.

19:10.071 --> 19:13.453
If they catch us trespassing, the
most they can do is fine us $800.

19:14.165 --> 19:15.353
What are you saying?

19:15.354 --> 19:19.005
All you need is some DNA.
A hair.

19:19.006 --> 19:22.237
And then we can put this
to bed one way or the other right now.

19:23.557 --> 19:24.605
You're serious?

19:24.806 --> 19:27.549
If it was my sister
out there, I'd need to know.

19:28.837 --> 19:30.917
I'll go with you to
the end of the line, Lindy.

19:31.318 --> 19:33.760
Thank you.

19:59.689 --> 20:00.841
Yeah?

20:00.842 --> 20:03.836
I have some information
on the Flirtual killer.

20:05.053 --> 20:06.013
Okay.

20:06.214 --> 20:10.948
Of a rumor that he attacked
the head of a Cyber Unit.

20:11.149 --> 20:12.649
She's in the hospital.

20:13.150 --> 20:14.493
How much of a rumor?

20:14.494 --> 20:16.461
It's true.
But no one will go on record.

20:16.462 --> 20:18.501
You mean Lindy
won't go on record.

20:19.469 --> 20:20.573
Yes.

20:22.249 --> 20:23.465
Good, run with it.

20:23.766 --> 20:26.725
Great, I'll see what
I can turn up around town.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.149
No, you know the drill.

20:28.150 --> 20:29.937
You've got the story of
the night.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.677
When we break this, I want
you running it from here.

20:35.657 --> 20:38.386
Great, sure. Thank you.

21:29.024 --> 21:30.045
Thanks.

21:31.609 --> 21:33.993
Okay. There's no official map

21:33.994 --> 21:36.657
or monikers of
the mass graves on Hart Island.

21:36.658 --> 21:39.657
But I found a rikers' prisoner
in charge of the burial crews

21:39.658 --> 21:41.129
from three years ago.

21:41.130 --> 21:43.705
He was just released,
lives a few hours upstate.

21:43.706 --> 21:46.329
It's a long shot but maybe
he remembers something.

21:46.330 --> 21:48.001
Let's try.

22:11.443 --> 22:12.732
We're on.

22:18.516 --> 22:21.028
Hi.
We're looking for Mick Ferguson.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.045
Is he around?

22:22.046 --> 22:23.325
He might be... who's asking?

22:23.326 --> 22:24.348
His niece.

22:24.349 --> 22:27.491
And I'm his fiancée.

22:27.492 --> 22:28.932
Ferguson?

22:30.407 --> 22:31.807
Thank you.

22:36.408 --> 22:38.945
Can I ask you about Hart Island?

22:39.385 --> 22:42.496
I think you might have
buried my sister there.

22:43.652 --> 22:46.400
Buried a lot of people.
A lot of years.

22:46.401 --> 22:47.989
I need to know where.

22:48.290 --> 22:51.089
Do you know the date
she died, Jane Doe number?

22:51.090 --> 22:54.024
December 22, 2012.

22:54.025 --> 22:55.844
Labeled 30-34.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.553
I was losing anyway.

23:02.396 --> 23:06.100
So... buried...

23:06.736 --> 23:09.988
First quarter of 2013...

23:11.188 --> 23:15.508
They'd have been on the
southeast side of the island.

23:15.509 --> 23:17.252
Next to the old asylum.

23:17.253 --> 23:18.408
Asylum?

23:18.409 --> 23:21.924
Yeah, they turned it into
a drug rehab center for women.

23:21.925 --> 23:24.845
Ironic it's called Hart Island.

23:24.846 --> 23:28.268
First time I went, I hadn't
seen a female in months.

23:28.269 --> 23:32.376
And there's all these
lost beauties wandering around.

23:33.576 --> 23:38.312
Drug addicts next to the
biggest graveyard in the world.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.133
Wasn't exactly the most
healing environment.

23:42.634 --> 23:44.845
It's all closed down now.

23:45.246 --> 23:47.976
We must be able
to work this out.

23:49.580 --> 23:51.460
How many bodies did you
bury a week?

23:51.461 --> 23:53.108
<i>"N" 32.</i>

23:53.309 --> 23:55.612
Well, I worked
three days a week,

23:55.613 --> 23:59.124
about 20 bodies a day,
so that's 60 bodies total.

24:00.192 --> 24:03.063
Started the new year in
plot "C."

24:03.098 --> 24:04.063
Here.

24:04.064 --> 24:05.680
<i>Boxes stacked about</i>

24:05.681 --> 24:07.129
<i>20 feet by 30 feet.</i>

24:07.130 --> 24:09.384
<i>We'd be out from
the main road about 90 feet.</i>

24:09.985 --> 24:11.760
Moving from the outside in.

24:11.761 --> 24:16.856
So around January 8th or 9th,
you'd be...

24:16.857 --> 24:18.580
Right about here.

24:18.581 --> 24:21.515
Yeah.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.018
Smart girl.

24:26.652 --> 24:29.388
She'd be here, resting soundly.

24:30.089 --> 24:35.323
Your sister, number 30-34
would be right about here.

24:47.431 --> 24:50.159
It's just me. Everyone's gone.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.340
The server rooms that way
but it's locked.

24:52.341 --> 24:54.008
Don't worry, I can get in.

24:54.409 --> 24:56.305
Just warn me if anyone comes back.

24:56.306 --> 24:57.368
Okay.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.156
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:05.157 --> 25:08.796
Don't be mad, but I got us some
disgustingly unhealthy indulgences.

25:13.192 --> 25:15.072
I snoop because I love you.

25:15.073 --> 25:16.528
Sophia, no.

25:16.829 --> 25:19.796
Okay, we have been
friends a long time.

25:19.797 --> 25:20.892
I...

25:22.147 --> 25:26.235
Okay, look, I will always
support you, through anything.

25:26.236 --> 25:27.938
Bipolar disorder or whatever
it may be...

25:27.939 --> 25:28.705
Sophia...

25:28.706 --> 25:30.658
But I looked into
these drugs, and it's

25:30.659 --> 25:32.906
really bad to drink
while taking them.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.970
So maybe that's something
you need to rethink.

25:34.971 --> 25:37.066
Sophia, it doesn't matter.

25:37.067 --> 25:38.754
Yes, it does.

25:38.755 --> 25:41.137
It... it can kill you.

25:45.022 --> 25:46.602
I'm not bipolar.

25:48.282 --> 25:50.522
I'm taking the pills
for seizures.

25:50.823 --> 25:53.630
Seizures? Why?

25:54.478 --> 25:56.206
I have a Glioblastoma.

25:56.407 --> 25:57.581
A what?

25:57.582 --> 25:59.606
A brain tumor.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.307
If this is a joke,
this is a really bad joke.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.539
It is a really bad joke,

26:05.540 --> 26:07.547
but I'm telling you the truth.

26:09.171 --> 26:12.255
I kept getting these
splitting headaches.

26:13.599 --> 26:17.195
And then the doctors found
this thing inside my head.

26:17.196 --> 26:18.979
Said they couldn't take it out.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.923
And I just decided not to
tell anyone.

26:24.747 --> 26:26.371
I mean, what do you even say?

26:28.391 --> 26:30.191
Do you post it on social media?

26:30.192 --> 26:33.143
You can't keep that from
the people that love you.

26:33.144 --> 26:34.855
That is not fair.

26:34.856 --> 26:36.663
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

26:36.664 --> 26:40.015
If I wanted you to know,
I would have told you.

26:41.919 --> 26:43.814
I'm so sorry.

26:45.055 --> 26:47.391
You had no right
to go through my things.

26:50.007 --> 26:52.103
See the way you're looking
at me now?

26:52.104 --> 26:55.263
I never wanted anyone to
look at me like that.

26:56.624 --> 26:59.891
I came here to have fun,
goddammit.

27:00.939 --> 27:05.955
You have to promise me you
won't tell anyone about this.

27:07.368 --> 27:08.967
Even Lindy.

27:10.867 --> 27:12.587
Promise me.

27:14.203 --> 27:15.435
I promise.

27:18.431 --> 27:20.063
I have to go for a walk.

27:37.419 --> 27:39.966
Hamish. What are you doing here?

27:39.967 --> 27:42.671
Last I checked, this was
my office.

27:44.071 --> 27:45.759
I thought you should eat.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.504
Come on, it'll get cold.

28:21.618 --> 28:22.818
Damn it.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.823
What's going on?

28:25.124 --> 28:26.540
I don't know.

28:30.587 --> 28:32.422
I think we should
push it off the street.

28:40.087 --> 28:44.791
Well... looks like we might be
stuck here for the night.

29:00.487 --> 29:01.780
You're not gonna eat your food?

29:01.781 --> 29:03.668
No.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.203
Connor...

29:06.713 --> 29:09.862
Why is there a police officer
in my server room?

29:10.463 --> 29:12.090
What?

29:12.091 --> 29:13.930
It's a simple question.

29:19.346 --> 29:21.082
I'll take the floor.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.554
You can't sleep on the floor.

29:22.555 --> 29:23.618
Sure I can.

29:23.619 --> 29:27.638
I spent a month in the outback
with nothing more than a blanket.

29:28.930 --> 29:30.922
Haven't you heard? They
build us tough in Australia.

29:31.025 --> 29:32.810
You never told me
why you moved there.

29:34.282 --> 29:35.649
No, I didn't.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.570
My parents were killed
in a car accident and I was

29:40.571 --> 29:41.785
sent to live with my aunt.

29:41.986 --> 29:43.329
I'm so sorry.

29:43.330 --> 29:46.986
Hey, I was five.
I hardly remember it.

29:54.805 --> 29:57.166
Thank you for today.

29:59.533 --> 30:01.374
Whatever we find out
about your sister tomorrow,

30:01.375 --> 30:03.014
it's not your fault.

30:04.926 --> 30:06.829
Sometimes that's
hard to believe.

30:10.838 --> 30:12.757
It's time to believe it.

30:26.753 --> 30:29.274
So you sure you still
wanna sleep on the floor?

30:29.275 --> 30:31.154
No.

30:36.114 --> 30:38.136
ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

30:38.171 --> 30:38.996
What?

30:39.497 --> 30:41.324
It's my rib from the cyclist.

30:41.725 --> 30:42.897
Let me look.

30:53.656 --> 30:54.680
Whoa.

30:56.494 --> 30:58.507
I had no idea how bad this was.

30:58.746 --> 31:01.025
It doesn't look so bad.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.802
It's purple and blue!

31:02.803 --> 31:04.770
Do you not see how bad this is?

31:05.471 --> 31:07.138
You might've broken a rib.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.123
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:10.322 --> 31:11.255
What?

31:12.106 --> 31:13.570
Your hands are cold.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.442
Okay, I'm gonna go get some ice.

31:20.018 --> 31:22.174
It'll take down the swelling.

31:22.575 --> 31:23.381
Thanks.

31:33.841 --> 31:35.340
So?

31:36.189 --> 31:39.116
They think you own
the Babylon portal.

31:39.117 --> 31:40.200
Own?

31:40.201 --> 31:43.452
Own is a very conventional
way of looking at it.

31:43.453 --> 31:45.876
I prefer curate.

31:47.357 --> 31:49.810
And that you know
who the killer is.

31:49.811 --> 31:53.968
Or... might actually be him?

31:55.109 --> 31:57.048
If only I had the time.

31:59.065 --> 32:01.937
Call him. Call your cop.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.557
Detective Calligan.

32:15.758 --> 32:18.137
I do hate a party crasher.

32:23.537 --> 32:25.373
Yeah, that's cold.

32:26.757 --> 32:28.701
I thought they built you
tough in Australia.

32:30.053 --> 32:31.724
I'm not taking it off.

32:33.405 --> 32:34.949
Okay.

32:36.850 --> 32:38.909
So we just sit here then?

32:42.982 --> 32:46.021
You can't feel any pain anymore.

32:47.501 --> 32:49.673
You'll have to back away.

33:41.148 --> 33:44.377
Did you really think
I would keep my servers here?

33:44.378 --> 33:46.677
That I would be that stupid?

33:46.678 --> 33:48.665
We know about Babylon.

33:48.666 --> 33:51.721
- You're gonna arrest me?
- Yes.

33:52.969 --> 33:56.257
I think not.
Here's how it's gonna go.

33:59.774 --> 34:03.953
You type "execute" and you
could shut down Babylon forever.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.929
You can save lives right now.

34:06.930 --> 34:09.072
You won't be able to pin
anything on me.

34:09.074 --> 34:10.565
It'll all be gone but...

34:10.565 --> 34:12.433
Why would I do that?

34:12.434 --> 34:16.658
See, I never do anything
without a parachute.

34:17.569 --> 34:20.917
I found a clue that'll lead
you to the killer.

34:22.507 --> 34:23.973
How can I be sure?

34:23.974 --> 34:25.725
You strike me as a gambling man.

34:25.726 --> 34:29.172
Come on, you'll get the biggest
lead you'll ever get and I walk free.

34:29.174 --> 34:31.101
Seems like a fair trade.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.349
Fair?

34:32.350 --> 34:34.733
It's gonna hurt me a lot
more than it's gonna hurt you.

34:36.516 --> 34:39.141
Now type "execute."

34:46.960 --> 34:48.697
You know you want to.

35:06.536 --> 35:08.136
All gone.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.468
You just cost me a lot of money.

35:16.224 --> 35:17.608
Deal's a deal.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.330
Bye now.

35:30.576 --> 35:32.488
Both of you.

36:14.358 --> 36:15.845
Sophia?

36:17.246 --> 36:18.596
Sophia?

36:21.708 --> 36:25.284
I knew it. I knew it was you.

36:26.758 --> 36:28.412
Please don't kill her.

36:31.188 --> 36:32.771
Kill me instead.

36:32.772 --> 36:34.692
Please?

36:39.204 --> 36:41.985
I've been looking for you.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.777
You'll be doing me a favor.

36:48.297 --> 36:50.080
Please?

36:50.081 --> 36:52.633
Please?

36:55.092 --> 36:56.653
I'm dying.

37:00.305 --> 37:04.284
I can't do it myself.
Please, please?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.512
Thank you.

37:13.544 --> 37:15.711
<i>You're welcome.</i>

37:56.114 --> 37:57.522
Hey, you.

37:58.810 --> 38:03.753
So the mechanic just left.
We are good to go.

38:05.954 --> 38:08.186
I feel hungover
but we didn't even drink.

38:08.187 --> 38:09.562
That's weird.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.042
Let me make it better.

38:30.421 --> 38:33.022
The Flirtual killer
didn't kill Reese.

38:34.123 --> 38:36.734
He got someone to do it for him.

38:36.735 --> 38:37.842
He sold it on Babylon.

38:37.843 --> 38:39.373
That means the killer
could've been anywhere

38:39.374 --> 38:41.138
when Reese was tied up
and murdered.

38:41.139 --> 38:45.454
Yes. Anywhere like Lindy's
birthday party.

38:45.455 --> 38:47.271
I rented us a boat.

38:47.672 --> 38:49.366
It'll take about
20 minutes or so.

38:49.367 --> 38:50.725
Wait here, I'll get the keys.

38:54.822 --> 38:56.390
What are you saying?

38:56.491 --> 38:58.417
Jake was in jail
when Reese was murdered.

38:59.118 --> 39:00.482
That was his alibi.

39:00.483 --> 39:02.146
But how could he have
pulled it off?

39:02.147 --> 39:03.965
Lindy was abducted from
the party and taken to a warehouse,

39:03.966 --> 39:07.630
but you arrested
Jake at the party.

39:10.814 --> 39:12.495
The time line is wrong.

39:13.396 --> 39:14.678
It has to be.

39:14.779 --> 39:17.578
<i>None of the guests were
sure when they last saw her,</i>

39:17.579 --> 39:19.866
<i>except Sophia and Yeager
who were distracted with</i>

39:19.867 --> 39:22.683
<i>the fire in the bathroom
around 10:20.</i>

39:22.684 --> 39:25.726
We arrested Jake around
11:00 p.m., that's 40 minutes.

39:26.327 --> 39:29.387
<i>She was drugged. He gets
her out of the apartment.</i>

39:29.388 --> 39:30.762
<i>No one is paying attention.</i>

39:30.763 --> 39:33.017
<i>While it takes Jake
14 minutes to get her to</i>

39:33.018 --> 39:36.450
<i>his car and drive her to the
warehouse, arriving around 10:35.</i>

39:38.258 --> 39:42.022
<i>Lindy witnesses someone kill
Reese, thinking it's the killer.</i>

39:45.821 --> 39:50.006
<i>It only takes Jake 12 minutes and he's
back at the party before 11:00 p.m.</i>

39:50.306 --> 39:52.203
Has anyone seen Lindy?

39:52.204 --> 39:55.646
Don't move. On your knees!

39:57.018 --> 39:58.690
He could've done it.

39:59.602 --> 40:00.795
Everything okay?

40:00.796 --> 40:04.738
I'm just trying to call
Sophia and it won't go through.

40:05.921 --> 40:07.414
Ready?

40:08.415 --> 40:09.518
Yeah.

40:18.319 --> 40:19.777
Can you hear me?

40:20.434 --> 40:22.426
Did you see the person
who attacked you?
