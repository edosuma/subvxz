00:07.159 --> 00:10.264
Someone died, like, right here.

00:10.265 --> 00:11.835
She was, like, a teenager.

00:11.836 --> 00:14.482
I started seeing the vision of a girl.

00:14.483 --> 00:16.986
She has suffered a lot.

00:16.987 --> 00:19.215
And she continues to suffer.

00:19.216 --> 00:20.571
Do you think this was an accident?

00:20.572 --> 00:21.559
No.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.812
How severe were those injuries?

00:22.813 --> 00:25.139
She could've had significant
injuries to her head.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.296
(Bleep).

00:26.297 --> 00:28.816
I'm concerned that he might
actually hurt somebody.

00:28.817 --> 00:32.223
See, he's getting mad again,
and he's pissed off now.

00:32.223 --> 00:33.292
Did you see anything?

00:33.293 --> 00:36.293
No. I just felt it.

00:36.849 --> 00:39.501
He threw her down.

00:39.502 --> 00:42.082
He killed her.

00:42.606 --> 00:44.639
There's something down there.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.760
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.524 --> 00:50.795
A lot of dead people are here.

00:50.796 --> 00:52.038
I see dead people.

00:52.039 --> 00:53.675
This is not good.

00:53.676 --> 00:55.650
I speak to dead people..

00:55.651 --> 00:57.454
He is very pissed off.

00:57.455 --> 00:59.013
And they speak to me..

00:59.014 --> 01:00.308
The house is angry.

01:00.309 --> 01:03.761
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:03.762 --> 01:05.544
He's killed people.

01:05.545 --> 01:07.019
I rely on my partner.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.468
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.470
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:10.471 --> 01:11.984
He got shot at his house?

01:11.985 --> 01:14.975
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:14.976 --> 01:16.361
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:16.362 --> 01:17.662
It's my job to reveal 'em.

01:17.663 --> 01:19.711
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist".

01:19.712 --> 01:21.853
But Steve and I never speak..

01:21.854 --> 01:23.836
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:23.837 --> 01:25.104
Until the very end.

01:25.105 --> 01:26.438
It's bad.

01:26.439 --> 01:28.540
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:28.541 --> 01:29.838
I'd like some answers.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.839
Or time to get out.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.367 --> 01:59.637
Amy and I work independently
of one another.

01:59.638 --> 02:01.672
I gather evidence, interview witnesses,

02:01.673 --> 02:06.253
and investigate the
history of each location.

02:06.254 --> 02:11.759
When we're done, we reveal our findings
to the clients and each other.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.563
I'm in Huntington, West Virginia, on
my way to meet with a local dentist.

02:15.564 --> 02:18.442
He tells me that the activity
in his office is so bad,

02:18.443 --> 02:21.132
even his employees don't
want to come to work.

02:21.133 --> 02:24.135
Worse, now that his patients
are starting to see things,

02:24.136 --> 02:28.696
he's afraid he's gonna lose his business.

02:34.978 --> 02:38.039
Before Amy enters a location,
I have to clear the area

02:38.040 --> 02:42.840
of anything that could
influence her findings.

02:43.452 --> 02:46.098
I can't hide the fact that
this is a dentist's office,

02:46.099 --> 02:49.931
but by removing the diplomas,
personal photos, and artwork..

02:49.932 --> 02:55.832
I can ensure that Amy's walk is free
of any kind of leading information.

03:07.470 --> 03:12.167
As I approach this location, dark
images begin flashing through my mind.

03:12.168 --> 03:18.068
The dead seem restless and are already
trying to communicate with me.

03:22.306 --> 03:24.106
I..

03:24.872 --> 03:28.218
Have this elderly gentleman with me.

03:28.219 --> 03:32.889
He's, uh, really tall, like, 6'2" to 6'4".

03:32.890 --> 03:36.654
He has, like, steely gray hair,

03:36.655 --> 03:39.372
and something happened,

03:39.373 --> 03:42.613
but I'm not sure what.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.240
Okay.

03:50.351 --> 03:52.211
Uh..

03:54.680 --> 03:58.520
Something happened in his office.

04:01.505 --> 04:06.245
I did hear, "murder.
Murder, murder, murder".

04:25.595 --> 04:28.189
So, Dr. Grimes, when we spoke on the
phone, you sounded a little concerned.

04:28.190 --> 04:29.532
Uh, what.. What's going on?

04:29.533 --> 04:31.792
We have a problem here.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.917
I've been in this building
for nearly 40 years.

04:34.918 --> 04:39.353
Starting out, things were just
noises that could be dismissed,

04:39.354 --> 04:42.377
but they have been increasing in intensity.

04:42.378 --> 04:44.966
I no longer have just sounds.

04:44.967 --> 04:47.805
I have visual things going on.

04:47.806 --> 04:51.000
In the last year this stuff
has really ramped up.

04:51.001 --> 04:53.117
It, uh, became more and more apparent

04:53.118 --> 04:57.586
that something was going
on, something frightening.

04:57.587 --> 04:59.964
As far as your employees go, I mean,
how are they dealing with it?

04:59.965 --> 05:01.292
Uh, they're afraid of it.

05:01.293 --> 05:04.315
Uh, well, for example, they
won't go upstairs at night.

05:04.316 --> 05:07.054
In fact, let me just show you something.

05:07.055 --> 05:10.620
I keep a logbook of incidents.

05:10.621 --> 05:13.485
It's not the little ones, uh,
they're too numerous, but..

05:13.486 --> 05:15.827
In this log, you will find, uh..

05:15.828 --> 05:19.120
Entries made by the people
who work here and others.

05:19.121 --> 05:21.170
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this before.

05:21.171 --> 05:24.473
I mean, I know people keep journals,
but I never saw a ghost log before.

05:24.474 --> 05:29.111
Are you concerned that what's ever
going on here is, uh, is dangerous?

05:29.112 --> 05:32.281
It's my concern that I could
actually frighten my patients away.

05:32.282 --> 05:38.182
If this increases, I may be in trouble,
uh, as far as my practice is concerned.

05:42.391 --> 05:45.255
Quite a few people died here..

05:45.256 --> 05:48.016
At this location.

05:48.369 --> 05:51.309
Quite a few people.

05:54.069 --> 05:59.589
I don't feel good about the
deaths that happened here.

06:01.743 --> 06:04.746
Like, I feel neglect, like, just..

06:04.747 --> 06:08.107
And I hear it. "Neglect".

06:15.533 --> 06:18.460
So, Doc, this doesn't look like
a dentist's office up here.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.962
It used to be a bedroom, uh,
in the original residence,

06:20.963 --> 06:25.568
and, uh, now it's just a place for
me to come and relax a little.

06:25.569 --> 06:27.336
Okay, so what's going on in here?

06:27.337 --> 06:29.805
This was, uh, originally, uh, a place

06:29.806 --> 06:33.544
where I started seeing the..
A vision of a little girl.

06:33.545 --> 06:34.876
You mean.. Can you describe her for me?

06:34.877 --> 06:36.611
Yes, I can. As a matter of fact,

06:36.612 --> 06:39.113
I've painted a painting
of her several years ago,

06:39.114 --> 06:41.452
- and I have it right here, which..
- Oh, this is her?

06:41.453 --> 06:46.387
This is as near as I could come
to the way she actually looked.

06:46.388 --> 06:50.288
As you can see, she's very sad.

06:51.393 --> 06:55.174
She makes you feel that you..
You've got to do something for her.

06:55.175 --> 06:58.334
One way I've tried to communicate
with her is through this painting.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.891
There's another way, and
I can show you that.

07:02.892 --> 07:05.205
I have left toys here for her.

07:05.206 --> 07:09.578
And I know that she's in here, because
some of these objects have moved.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.147
Do you feel like you're..

07:11.148 --> 07:14.250
Uh, consumed by this whole
thing going on in this house?

07:14.251 --> 07:18.332
Well, if you could see her,
uh, you would feel as I do.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.888
She makes you feel that you..

07:19.889 --> 07:21.790
You've got to do something for her.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.626
And you're a Father, and, you know, it's..

07:23.627 --> 07:25.797
It.. It does get to you.

07:25.798 --> 07:29.363
I have tried very hard
to reach out to her..

07:29.364 --> 07:32.501
Because of the empathy I feel for her.

07:32.502 --> 07:34.737
Now have you seen her on this floor?

07:34.738 --> 07:40.638
Uh, yes. In fact, she was standing
right there at that door.

07:47.048 --> 07:49.251
So what happened here on the stairs?

07:49.252 --> 07:52.732
I was down here, and, uh..

07:52.760 --> 07:54.956
She would just stand there looking at me,

07:54.957 --> 07:57.904
and I would get this strange feeling
that someone was looking at me,

07:57.905 --> 08:03.005
and I would turn around,
and there she would be.

08:06.568 --> 08:08.222
Mm.

08:08.223 --> 08:11.283
I hate the stairwell.

08:11.326 --> 08:15.046
I hate it. I don't know why.

08:16.745 --> 08:19.550
Something in that space..

08:19.551 --> 08:23.091
Is not good at all. It's..

08:23.727 --> 08:27.287
Making me sick to my stomach.

08:27.288 --> 08:31.216
I'm feeling a great deal of pain and
negativity coming from the stairwell.

08:31.217 --> 08:33.496
I know something horrible happened there..

08:33.498 --> 08:37.518
And I'm nervous to find out what.

08:38.761 --> 08:40.562
Mm.

08:44.930 --> 08:49.010
Someone like, died like, right here.

08:49.397 --> 08:51.270
It's a lady.

08:51.271 --> 08:53.472
She's, like, a teenager, and..

08:53.473 --> 08:57.176
And her heart's pounding.
Her heart's pounding.

08:57.177 --> 09:01.257
She's crying, and she peed herself.

09:03.070 --> 09:08.650
So much pain, and, uh, she
broke her legs or something.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.851
So have you experienced anything else here?

09:17.852 --> 09:19.665
Yes, I have. I was walking through this

09:19.666 --> 09:21.963
hallway late one evening,
turning things off.

09:21.964 --> 09:24.419
Uh, we were ready to leave the office.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.165
And from about this height..

09:27.166 --> 09:29.780
A voice came to me, a
man's voice, very deep.

09:29.781 --> 09:32.466
And he said, "get out of here".

09:32.467 --> 09:34.263
He, uh, is a huge man.

09:34.264 --> 09:38.331
He's big, and I've heard
him more than seen him.

09:38.332 --> 09:39.632
Now you've actually seen him?

09:39.633 --> 09:42.600
I haven't seen him so much.
I saw a shadow here

09:42.601 --> 09:47.271
and a shadow there, but he goes up and
down these stairs constantly, it seems.

09:47.272 --> 09:49.943
You can hear him stomping, literally.

09:49.944 --> 09:53.780
He's the one that I'm really concerned
about because of his aggression

09:53.781 --> 09:59.681
and because of his size, and I'm concerned
that he might actually hurt somebody.

10:02.294 --> 10:05.177
So she died, like, right here.

10:05.178 --> 10:09.170
This guy is laughing. He's just laughing.

10:09.171 --> 10:13.403
This large, angry man is the same
one I saw when I first arrived.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.010
I believe he's this poor girl's Father.

10:16.011 --> 10:20.348
He's very intimidating,
extremely cruel, and sadistic.

10:20.349 --> 10:22.925
He's just laughing and laughing.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.152
"She was a useless bitch".

10:25.153 --> 10:28.523
"She (Bleep) Wanted all this
stuff, the little bitch".

10:28.524 --> 10:31.693
"I didn't have a use for her any more".

10:31.694 --> 10:35.894
Because he didn't like her any more.

10:37.844 --> 10:40.424
He killed her.

10:54.861 --> 10:56.661
Mm.

10:58.660 --> 11:01.556
You know, he killed her.

11:01.557 --> 11:05.061
He didn't like her any more,
and he didn't want her around,

11:05.062 --> 11:08.114
and she annoyed him, and..

11:08.115 --> 11:11.535
(Bleep)! What the (Bleep)?!

11:17.841 --> 11:20.361
What happened?

11:20.544 --> 11:23.304
Mm. He poked me.

11:24.282 --> 11:28.469
He doesn't want me to
really talk about it..

11:28.470 --> 11:32.370
Because he got mad and ran away.

11:41.998 --> 11:45.846
So, Carey, I spoke with your Dad, and,
uh, he told me what was going on here.

11:45.847 --> 11:46.924
Now what about yourself?

11:46.925 --> 11:48.139
Have you experienced anything here?

11:48.140 --> 11:53.240
I have, when I was a child
in the waiting room.

11:54.370 --> 11:58.178
Uh, there was a young girl, and she was
kind of peeking around the corner at me.

11:58.179 --> 11:59.384
Okay. What'd she look like?

11:59.385 --> 12:03.035
Uh, she was young, so I'd
say probably 12 or 13.

12:03.036 --> 12:06.492
I just remember her face and her hair,
because she had long hair like I did,

12:06.493 --> 12:10.349
and that stood out to me. Long, dark hair.

12:10.350 --> 12:13.138
She had her head hung low,
and she would swing it

12:13.139 --> 12:17.459
back and forth while she looked at me.

12:17.614 --> 12:20.085
Did it look like the girl your Dad painted?

12:20.086 --> 12:21.935
Yes.

12:21.936 --> 12:25.217
Your Father seems pretty,
uh, consumed almost.

12:25.218 --> 12:26.351
Are you concerned for him?

12:26.352 --> 12:28.186
I just worry about his reputation.

12:28.187 --> 12:29.344
I mean, this is his livelihood.

12:29.345 --> 12:31.489
This is everything for him..

12:31.490 --> 12:33.381
- Right.
- 40 years' worth of work.

12:33.382 --> 12:34.886
He's got so much to lose.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.022
Absolutely everything.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.091
Even though the Doc and his daughter
have seen the same apparition.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.828
I need to speak with someone
who's outside the family.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.930
So I'm going to meet with a
woman who used to work here

12:44.931 --> 12:49.311
to see if she's had similar encounters.

12:55.272 --> 12:57.699
Karen, I understand you're a
former employee of the Doctor.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.494
That's correct.

12:58.495 --> 13:00.312
Okay, and how long did you work here?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.914
Probably a couple years.

13:01.915 --> 13:05.550
Okay. Now he's explained some bizarre
things that he's experienced here.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.390
Now how about yourself?

13:07.391 --> 13:11.341
There's been some bizarre
things happen to me also.

13:11.342 --> 13:13.305
Can you tell me about anything?

13:13.306 --> 13:18.414
I was assisting Dr.
Grimes in doing a root canal..

13:18.415 --> 13:20.600
And I glanced up.

13:20.601 --> 13:25.472
And there was a girl standing right
behind where you're standing.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.988
What did she look like to you?

13:26.989 --> 13:29.380
She had long..

13:29.381 --> 13:31.743
Very well-groomed..

13:31.744 --> 13:33.119
Dark hair.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.436
She seemed to me to be pretty.

13:35.437 --> 13:37.244
I can see her today as well as then.

13:37.245 --> 13:38.980
- It's that vivid in your mind?
- It's that vivid.

13:38.981 --> 13:41.144
- Okay.
- I will never forget it.

13:41.145 --> 13:44.254
I can see it's upsetting for you
to even be in the building.

13:44.255 --> 13:48.011
This room doesn't bother me as bad..

13:48.012 --> 13:51.072
As the room upstairs.

13:52.170 --> 13:54.487
I went up to get a file.

13:54.488 --> 13:58.114
And I could feel someone
in that room with me.

13:58.115 --> 13:59.239
Did you see anything?

13:59.240 --> 14:02.240
No. I just felt it.

14:04.221 --> 14:06.766
What happens when you walk into that room?

14:06.767 --> 14:09.107
That room..

14:10.519 --> 14:15.079
I felt like something came over me, like..

14:15.795 --> 14:19.395
Like someone was watching me.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.780
What the (Bleep)?

14:35.524 --> 14:39.064
The more I'm here, like, uh..

14:39.065 --> 14:41.676
The more I don't like this place.

14:41.677 --> 14:43.537
Why?

14:44.427 --> 14:46.407
Well..

14:47.042 --> 14:51.662
This guy was not good, and he was a liar.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.160
He's hiding h.. What h.. He looks like.

14:58.354 --> 15:02.121
Ever since the big man poked me
on the stairs, he's been hiding.

15:02.122 --> 15:05.947
I know he's watching me, but
he doesn't want to be seen.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.629
See, he's getting mad again. Yeah.

15:08.630 --> 15:13.130
- Is he back, hon?
- He's, like, coming.

15:13.551 --> 15:15.591
Coming.

15:26.137 --> 15:28.067
Charlotte, I understand that you
actually worked for the Doctor?

15:28.068 --> 15:29.173
Yes, I did.

15:29.174 --> 15:30.562
Okay. What did you do?

15:30.563 --> 15:34.727
I owned a commercial cleaning
business, and I cleaned his offices.

15:34.728 --> 15:37.194
Now I was wondering if you,
while you were working here,

15:37.195 --> 15:39.211
ever experienced anything paranormal.

15:39.212 --> 15:40.755
Yes. Yes, I did.

15:40.756 --> 15:44.928
I was working in the kitchen,
and I heard this crying,

15:44.929 --> 15:47.518
and so I come back into this room.

15:47.519 --> 15:49.644
And this little girl is not crying..

15:49.645 --> 15:51.356
She's sobbing..

15:51.357 --> 15:54.777
As if her heart's broken.

15:55.881 --> 15:57.217
What did you do next?

15:57.218 --> 15:58.551
I came in and sit down.

15:58.552 --> 16:01.552
Although I didn't see her..

16:01.553 --> 16:05.557
I heard her, and I wanted to
sit down and comfort her.

16:05.558 --> 16:07.961
And try to help her in any way I could.

16:07.962 --> 16:09.729
And you just sat down and started trying..

16:09.730 --> 16:10.730
- Yes.
- To calm her down?

16:10.731 --> 16:12.399
- Right.
- But you never saw her?

16:12.400 --> 16:13.866
No. No.

16:13.867 --> 16:18.171
Whenever I come up these
stairs, I can feel her.

16:18.172 --> 16:22.380
I.. I can feel her presence,
and I can feel the sadness..

16:22.381 --> 16:25.078
And the heaviness.

16:25.079 --> 16:28.319
She has suffered a lot.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.927
And she continues to suffer.

16:37.936 --> 16:40.060
It's (Bleep) Up.

16:40.061 --> 16:43.296
He did, like, not want to..

16:43.297 --> 16:45.231
Really take care of his family.

16:45.232 --> 16:49.492
Like, he felt like they were leeches..

16:51.271 --> 16:54.797
And.. And, like, he would,
like, starve people.

16:54.798 --> 16:57.910
Like I feel like he's
starving people, he's lying..

16:57.911 --> 17:01.091
He, like, um, is, um..

17:01.382 --> 17:02.712
Just bad.

17:02.713 --> 17:05.593
Just a bad person.

17:05.953 --> 17:08.173
And, um..

17:09.622 --> 17:12.922
And then the.. There's..

17:13.472 --> 17:16.771
There's blood everywhere.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.053
So far, all I've got is a
lot of witness testimony,

17:32.054 --> 17:34.989
as to what's going on inside Dr.
Grimes office.

17:34.990 --> 17:37.810
But I need facts.

17:42.026 --> 17:43.958
Going through the library's archives.

17:43.959 --> 17:48.286
I find an article about a
21-year-old girl who died in 1929.

17:48.287 --> 17:54.187
From a fall in the same building
the Doc runs his practice at.

17:56.274 --> 18:00.026
The Doc told me he keeps seeing a young
girl who looks like she's sad and in pain.

18:00.027 --> 18:03.665
Now it turns out, a young girl
actually died in his duplex.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.541
So I'm headed off to meet
with a local historian,

18:05.542 --> 18:10.522
who promises to tell me
the rest of the story.

18:15.948 --> 18:19.581
I came across this article
about a girl named Lavina.

18:19.582 --> 18:23.784
That died from a fall in the location
I'm investigating, but it's very vague.

18:23.785 --> 18:25.574
Uh, so I was wondering if
you could help me out.

18:25.575 --> 18:28.219
She's sort of a woman of mystery.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.804
Uh, what we do know about
her, though, says..

18:30.805 --> 18:34.690
Suggests that her story
was a very tragic one.

18:34.691 --> 18:36.974
Her Mother, uh, Bernice..

18:36.975 --> 18:41.665
Was, uh, married to, uh, this
gentleman named, uh, Cyrus.

18:41.666 --> 18:43.854
- Okay.
- Apparently, uh, he liked to drink.

18:43.855 --> 18:48.217
And when he, uh, was drunk, he
liked to, uh, beat on his wife.

18:48.218 --> 18:53.406
And then, of course, the next day,
he sobered up and was very contrite.

18:53.407 --> 18:58.927
In 1913, Lavina, her elder
sister, and her Mother left.

18:59.190 --> 19:02.187
And moved into the duplex on 20th street.

19:02.188 --> 19:03.481
- In Huntington.
- Okay.

19:03.482 --> 19:05.217
Where Dr. Grimes' office is now?

19:05.218 --> 19:06.225
Exactly.

19:06.226 --> 19:08.045
We don't know if the Father
ever came back and..

19:08.046 --> 19:09.280
Or tried to find them or..

19:09.281 --> 19:10.596
We don't.. We don't know.

19:10.597 --> 19:13.134
Okay, but he was a miserable
bastard, this guy, apparently.

19:13.135 --> 19:14.615
And they, they had to get away from him.

19:14.616 --> 19:18.816
That's what the record, uh, suggests.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.492
I feel like there's..

19:27.493 --> 19:30.733
People. They're arguing.

19:31.281 --> 19:34.321
There's a male, and he's a liar..

19:34.322 --> 19:37.201
And there's the two ladies, and..

19:37.202 --> 19:39.722
And, uh, he..

19:42.821 --> 19:44.741
Wha..

19:44.885 --> 19:49.249
He's chasing.. Like, he's following them.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.726
And..

19:50.727 --> 19:52.519
Uh..

19:52.520 --> 19:55.400
He's doing things.

19:57.611 --> 19:59.672
As I walk through this house, I keep seeing

19:59.673 --> 20:01.962
the dead girl's Father by the stairwell.

20:01.963 --> 20:07.863
He's very upset, and he's taking
his aggression out on his family.

20:10.451 --> 20:12.506
His wife..

20:12.507 --> 20:17.136
Ran away because he's coming
in, and he's pissed off now.

20:17.137 --> 20:19.590
This is happening right now?

20:19.591 --> 20:21.511
Yeah.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.457
Uh, it says she died from a fall.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.276
Um, but the articles are
vague, and they just..

20:30.277 --> 20:32.943
The articles are, uh, not just vague.

20:32.944 --> 20:34.337
They're contradictory.

20:34.338 --> 20:35.458
Right.

20:35.459 --> 20:38.808
I have here, uh, her death certificate.

20:38.809 --> 20:41.840
Which actually says that she died..

20:41.841 --> 20:45.381
From acute alcohol poisoning.

20:46.341 --> 20:49.241
But the paper says she's.. She fell, so..

20:49.242 --> 20:50.944
Well, who.. Who do you thinks right?

20:50.945 --> 20:53.387
I have no idea.

20:53.388 --> 20:54.552
This is during prohibition.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.349
West Virginia went dry in 1914.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.686
But nobody stopped drinking.

20:59.687 --> 21:01.351
One word..

21:01.352 --> 21:02.664
"Moonshine".

21:02.665 --> 21:03.457
Ah.

21:03.458 --> 21:08.662
And what prohibition did was create an
entirely new market for the moonshiners.

21:08.663 --> 21:09.378
Okay.

21:09.379 --> 21:11.358
- But moon shining is an art.
- Right.

21:11.359 --> 21:14.798
If you don't do it right, you
can kill your customers.

21:14.799 --> 21:18.038
So it.. All possibility is she could've
gotten a hold of some bad liquor.

21:18.039 --> 21:19.104
Exactly.

21:19.105 --> 21:21.988
So the death certificate says one thing,
and the newspaper articles say another.

21:21.989 --> 21:26.871
One article, uh, says that she
died after an illness of ten days.

21:26.872 --> 21:29.149
As the result of a fall.

21:29.150 --> 21:31.070
Okay.

21:34.268 --> 21:38.199
Her legs are messed up,
like, so there's nerves..

21:38.200 --> 21:41.077
There was a pain here.

21:41.078 --> 21:45.398
A really bad pain here, like a crunch.

21:45.807 --> 21:50.667
And this guy is laughing.
He's just laughing.

21:52.127 --> 21:54.796
Do you think this was an accident?

21:54.797 --> 21:56.597
No.

21:57.269 --> 22:00.329
He's happy about it.

22:01.307 --> 22:03.527
I think..

22:04.796 --> 22:07.642
He threw her down.

22:07.643 --> 22:10.583
This is so (Bleep).

22:10.789 --> 22:14.329
I think he tossed her over.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.217
Something about this case
does not sit right with me.

22:27.218 --> 22:30.932
The newspaper article states
that Lavina died from a fall.

22:30.933 --> 22:34.153
But the death certificate
lists another cause of death.

22:34.154 --> 22:36.053
So what I did was send
all the paperwork over

22:36.054 --> 22:38.047
to one of the top paramedics in the County

22:38.048 --> 22:43.088
to see if he can make
any sense of it for me.

22:52.557 --> 22:54.609
So, Steve, I'm sure with
your experience, uh,

22:54.610 --> 22:58.364
you've responded to thousands
of people falling.

22:58.365 --> 23:00.027
Now the pain she must've been in

23:00.028 --> 23:01.452
- if it was a fall..
- Right.

23:01.453 --> 23:03.723
Uh, how severe were those
injuries, uh, that she died from?

23:03.724 --> 23:06.855
If she was climbing the stairs
and she fell 10 or 12 stairs,

23:06.856 --> 23:09.593
which would've been her height
or two times her height,

23:09.594 --> 23:12.560
you know she could've had significant
injuries, significant injuries to her head,

23:12.561 --> 23:15.913
bruises on the brain, bleeding
that starts to spread.

23:15.914 --> 23:18.996
As that bleeding starts to spread,
they're gonna have severe headache.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.149
After severe headache, they're
gonna have blurry vision,

23:21.150 --> 23:23.475
and after blurry vision,
you know, ultimately,

23:23.476 --> 23:28.336
altered mental status, and
then unconsciousness.

23:32.089 --> 23:35.407
He, like, threw her down.

23:35.408 --> 23:40.928
He was like, "it's like..
She's all broken. (Bleep) ".

23:42.385 --> 23:44.353
And then..

23:44.354 --> 23:47.442
There was a pain here.

23:47.443 --> 23:51.763
A really bad pain here, like a crunch.

23:57.796 --> 23:59.970
Yeah. Oh, that.. (Bleep).

23:59.971 --> 24:02.708
I don't know. Maybe she broke her back.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.237
It's not good at all.

24:05.238 --> 24:07.998
It's really bad.

24:11.035 --> 24:13.880
The death certificate lists alcohol
poisoning as the cause of death.

24:13.881 --> 24:17.021
Now it's 1929, so this is prohibition.

24:17.022 --> 24:20.136
Right. The federal government
was still producing..

24:20.137 --> 24:22.643
Uh, alcohol for medicinal purposes.

24:22.644 --> 24:25.181
Now would a civilian be able to get that?

24:25.182 --> 24:29.228
What they tried to do was they tried
to take that medicinal alcohol..

24:29.229 --> 24:33.440
And they would put small traces
of poison in that alcohol.

24:33.441 --> 24:36.946
To prevent people from using it
as a recreational, uh, drink.

24:36.947 --> 24:38.787
And just for the purposes
that it was produced.

24:38.788 --> 24:41.606
Okay, so that.. That was their way of
trying to curb them from using it.

24:41.607 --> 24:42.629
Exactly.

24:42.630 --> 24:45.612
So, Steve, if she started to
ingest this poison liquor,

24:45.613 --> 24:47.921
uh, would it taste like alcohol?
Would it.. What would happen?

24:47.922 --> 24:51.892
As she ingested this, it's gonna cause
severe burning in her upper airway.

24:51.893 --> 24:53.685
As she swallows it, it's
gonna cause burning

24:53.686 --> 24:56.199
going down her esophagus
down into her stomach.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.015
And it's gonna aggravate
her stomach lining.

24:58.016 --> 25:00.228
Would moonshine cause that
same type of symptom?

25:00.229 --> 25:03.607
Yes. When they filtered
these homemade spirits,

25:03.608 --> 25:05.828
they were filtered through radiators,

25:05.829 --> 25:11.729
and eventually lead poisoning,
uh, could've been a possibility.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.670
The daughter that died on the stairs..

25:19.671 --> 25:22.480
There was a sickness with the throat.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.845
Uh, like, um..

25:24.846 --> 25:28.673
Really bad illness that affected..

25:28.674 --> 25:29.947
Uh, the throat.

25:29.948 --> 25:32.948
Like a.. Really bad.

25:36.862 --> 25:40.518
It's, uh, really this intense pain.

25:40.519 --> 25:43.173
Going all the way down.

25:43.174 --> 25:46.886
Can you describe the pain in their throat?

25:46.887 --> 25:49.997
It's like if you've eaten a lot of lemons.

25:49.998 --> 25:53.330
And then you get the pain in your ears.

25:53.331 --> 25:57.891
And it's all raw and burning.. Like that.

25:58.935 --> 26:01.971
The death certificate says one thing.
The newspaper articles say another.

26:01.972 --> 26:03.611
I'm up in the air on what I
think might have happened.

26:03.612 --> 26:06.803
So I wanted to get your opinion and what
you thought about both the reports.

26:06.804 --> 26:10.415
By looking at the newspaper accounts,
reviewing her death certificate..

26:10.416 --> 26:13.321
It looks like Miss Wall
either was drinking..

26:13.322 --> 26:15.493
Went to climb the steps,
fell down the steps,

26:15.494 --> 26:18.792
suffered some type of head
injury or internal bleeding.

26:18.793 --> 26:20.661
Or she had fallen.

26:20.662 --> 26:25.547
And after she had fallen, she may have
been trying to, uh, lessen that pain..

26:25.548 --> 26:27.558
Numb those nerve receptors herself.

26:27.559 --> 26:30.353
By using, whether it be
illegal or legal spirits.

26:30.354 --> 26:32.130
Okay, but the cure could've
been worse than the illness.

26:32.131 --> 26:34.711
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:45.803 --> 26:48.217
During my walk, I encountered an older man

26:48.218 --> 26:50.675
and the daughter I think
he brutally murdered.

26:50.676 --> 26:54.357
I'm meeting with a sketch
artist to reveal what I saw.

26:54.358 --> 26:57.958
He's approximately 60 to 65.

26:58.637 --> 27:00.723
If you could describe him
in, like, a couple words..

27:00.724 --> 27:02.884
"Cowboy".

27:03.966 --> 27:06.769
He has a very rugged..

27:06.770 --> 27:08.537
Uh, thick skin.

27:08.538 --> 27:13.398
Because he used to do a
lot of work outside.

27:14.211 --> 27:16.712
Does he carry a lot of..
Any weight in his face?

27:16.713 --> 27:17.880
- No.
- Okay.

27:17.881 --> 27:21.541
Mm-mm. He's broad-shouldered.

27:25.129 --> 27:27.244
His hair is very thick.

27:27.245 --> 27:28.817
It's wavy.

27:28.818 --> 27:32.898
- It's a nice silver gray.
- Okay.

27:34.206 --> 27:37.626
Amy, is this who you saw?

27:39.094 --> 27:40.954
Yes.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.888
Now that our investigations are complete.

28:10.889 --> 28:14.205
We're hoping our findings will help Dr.
Grimes save his practice.

28:14.206 --> 28:16.691
I've invited Karen to join
us because I feel she

28:16.692 --> 28:21.612
needs answers to her own
terrifying experiences.

28:23.015 --> 28:25.326
Dr. Grimes is..

28:25.327 --> 28:28.319
The owner of the duplex.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.288
It's his dentist office.

28:30.289 --> 28:32.691
Karen actually used to work for Dr. Grimes.

28:32.692 --> 28:36.252
The reason we are here and
why he called us in is, uh..

28:36.253 --> 28:39.118
He's had activity there
for the entire time.

28:39.119 --> 28:42.462
But recently it's really increased.

28:42.463 --> 28:44.040
He thinks he may be losing patients

28:44.041 --> 28:45.795
because of some of the things
that are going on there.

28:45.796 --> 28:47.403
And he needs to know what's happening.

28:47.404 --> 28:49.146
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

28:49.147 --> 28:53.947
And she can start telling
us about her walk.

28:59.501 --> 29:01.737
This is really bad.

29:01.738 --> 29:03.435
Really bad.

29:03.436 --> 29:06.107
So I started going up one the staircases..

29:06.108 --> 29:08.318
And I saw this..

29:08.319 --> 29:10.728
Girl laying there.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.549
And she was dead.

29:14.745 --> 29:16.559
She was, like, twisted.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.582
Her legs are not right.

29:18.583 --> 29:21.152
One was bent awkwardly at the knee.

29:21.153 --> 29:22.256
Mm.

29:22.257 --> 29:25.677
She was in absolute agony.

29:25.724 --> 29:30.394
All of her nerves in her
legs were, like, on fire.

29:30.395 --> 29:34.475
And I got this intense throat pain.

29:34.968 --> 29:37.340
There was a sickness with the throat.

29:37.341 --> 29:41.839
Uh, really this intense pain's
going all the way down.

29:41.840 --> 29:45.560
And it's all raw and burning.

29:46.879 --> 29:50.614
There was a young girl that did die..

29:50.615 --> 29:52.209
Back in 1929.

29:52.210 --> 29:55.128
Her name was Lavina Wall.

29:55.129 --> 29:58.074
But the cause of her death is unclear.

29:58.075 --> 30:00.891
Newspapers articles say
she died from a fall.

30:00.892 --> 30:02.877
- Oh, my gosh. Really?
- A fall?

30:02.878 --> 30:04.998
The death certificate, which I have here,

30:04.999 --> 30:08.252
says she died from acute liquor poisoning.

30:08.253 --> 30:09.087
What?

30:09.088 --> 30:12.703
It was the prohibition, so
it was medicinal liquor.

30:12.704 --> 30:15.284
Um, but some of the
liquors had poison in it.

30:15.285 --> 30:18.910
He said if that happened, if
she drank it, she would've..

30:18.911 --> 30:21.746
Choking and burning
sensation in the throat.

30:21.747 --> 30:23.107
Windpipe would close.

30:23.108 --> 30:26.583
Well, she died an agonizing death.
She lasted a few days.

30:26.584 --> 30:27.818
Ohh.

30:27.819 --> 30:31.722
You know, you've had an instance
where you've seen a young girl.

30:31.723 --> 30:35.204
I would get a strange feeling
that someone was watching me.

30:35.205 --> 30:36.214
Mm-hmm.

30:36.215 --> 30:40.724
And I would turn and look at the..
The doorway at the top of the stairwell.

30:40.725 --> 30:43.914
And just for a split instant..

30:43.915 --> 30:46.303
I would see a flash of a little girl.

30:46.304 --> 30:49.451
I could see pain in her eyes.

30:49.452 --> 30:54.360
And a longing for someone
to understand that pain.

30:54.361 --> 30:55.639
Mm-hmm.

30:55.640 --> 31:00.073
It.. It's hard to describe that, but it..
It was a..

31:00.074 --> 31:03.159
A, um, a moment of change.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.824
From absolute terror..

31:05.825 --> 31:06.640
Mm-hmm.

31:06.641 --> 31:10.961
To feeling that you wanna help someone.

31:14.865 --> 31:17.517
I did do a sketch of the scene.

31:17.518 --> 31:21.118
That I saw on the staircase.

31:34.384 --> 31:36.784
Oh, my God.

31:42.013 --> 31:44.236
Now you're very protective of this..

31:44.237 --> 31:46.045
- Little entity that you see.
- I am.

31:46.046 --> 31:48.888
Now how do you feel about
that, seeing her like that?

31:48.889 --> 31:51.944
Well, it's like seeing one
of your children hurt.

31:51.945 --> 31:52.943
Really hurt.

31:52.944 --> 31:56.117
Did you get to see her face or anything?

31:56.118 --> 31:58.458
I did not.

31:58.509 --> 32:00.269
I only got a quick glimpse of her face.

32:00.270 --> 32:03.024
So I didn't feel confident
enough to sketch it.

32:03.025 --> 32:06.817
But I got a very strong sense
of everything else about her.

32:06.818 --> 32:10.730
The unfortunate part about this girl is..

32:10.731 --> 32:12.837
I couldn't find a photo of her anywhere.

32:12.838 --> 32:17.356
But the good Doctor here
is quite a painter.

32:17.357 --> 32:19.864
He actually painted a picture of her.

32:19.865 --> 32:22.385
Which I have.

32:24.339 --> 32:26.263
Everybody else has seen it but you.

32:26.264 --> 32:28.424
Oh, wow.

32:33.878 --> 32:36.820
- So you think it's her?
- Without a doubt.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.754
Dr. Grimes, can you do me a
favor and explain to Amy..

32:39.755 --> 32:41.752
How you're trying to communicate
with this little girl?

32:41.753 --> 32:44.934
There's a closet in the room
at the top of the stairs..

32:44.935 --> 32:49.392
And I, over the years,
have put toys in there.

32:49.393 --> 32:51.628
To let her know that there
are people who care.

32:51.629 --> 32:54.085
I don't know if I'm doing
the they're thing or not.

32:54.086 --> 32:56.147
Is that a good thing or
a bad thing he's doing?

32:56.148 --> 32:57.726
Really bad.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.875
What can happen is that..

32:59.876 --> 33:03.901
A lot of times, um, we become
a little too attached.

33:03.902 --> 33:08.478
That attachment can actually be something
else that kind of holds them here.

33:08.479 --> 33:10.279
Oh.

33:13.117 --> 33:15.658
What else did you see?

33:15.659 --> 33:18.364
Um, I also encountered..

33:18.365 --> 33:21.113
A really negative male.

33:21.114 --> 33:24.328
At the top of the stairs..

33:24.329 --> 33:26.563
Who I believe is her Father.

33:26.564 --> 33:30.344
And he really hated his family.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.897
This guy is laughing.

33:32.898 --> 33:35.324
He's just laughing and laughing.

33:35.325 --> 33:37.671
"She was a useless bitch".

33:37.672 --> 33:40.021
"She (Bleep) Wanted all this stuff".

33:40.022 --> 33:44.684
"And I didn't have any
use for her any more".

33:44.685 --> 33:48.432
Why don't you explain to Amy
what you told me, about..

33:48.433 --> 33:50.287
What's going on upstairs?

33:50.288 --> 33:52.759
In the stairwell..

33:52.760 --> 33:57.368
I have heard a man really
putting his feet down hard.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.815
Like he's stomping.

33:58.816 --> 34:02.132
And I get the impression
he's a rather large man.

34:02.133 --> 34:04.514
He came up behind me one
evening as I was turning

34:04.515 --> 34:06.386
off the lights and everything in the house.

34:06.387 --> 34:08.871
He simply said, "get out of here".

34:08.873 --> 34:11.661
I would get so afraid that I
would just have to leave.

34:11.661 --> 34:13.678
He's aggressive.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.869
He seems to be angry about something.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.313
He's very violent.

34:17.315 --> 34:20.074
- Violent?
- Yes.

34:21.428 --> 34:23.597
He is a very violent personality.

34:23.598 --> 34:27.889
When I was talking about
what happened to her..

34:27.891 --> 34:30.362
He became extremely upset.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.936
And then he came up behind me and he..

34:33.937 --> 34:35.996
Poked me really hard right here.

34:35.998 --> 34:39.118
And then he ran away.

34:40.728 --> 34:41.972
(Bleep)!

34:41.973 --> 34:43.788
What the (Bleep)?!

34:43.789 --> 34:45.246
What happened?

34:45.246 --> 34:47.411
He poked me.

34:47.411 --> 34:51.312
Because he got mad and ran away.

34:52.123 --> 34:56.295
Now, Karen, you.. You.. You're..
You got emotional again.

34:56.297 --> 34:58.452
I was upstairs..

34:58.453 --> 35:01.529
And I was hit with something..

35:01.530 --> 35:05.884
That I was so cold it
affected my whole body.

35:05.885 --> 35:10.057
My knees were shaking.
It was bad. Very bad.

35:10.058 --> 35:12.758
Very frightening.

35:13.378 --> 35:16.273
There's a back story to Lavina.

35:16.274 --> 35:18.311
The girl that died in the duplex.

35:18.312 --> 35:20.777
Her, her Mother, and her older sister..

35:20.778 --> 35:24.724
Fled Ohio from their abusive, drunk Father.

35:24.725 --> 35:27.420
His name was Cyrus.

35:27.421 --> 35:33.321
And just by looking at the photo of him,
you can see he's a real miserable guy.

35:36.594 --> 35:37.560
Wow.

35:37.561 --> 35:39.878
He was abusive. He was a drunk.

35:39.879 --> 35:43.647
He beat his wife. But then the next
day, he would be apologetic about it.

35:43.648 --> 35:45.988
Whoa. Okay.

35:47.504 --> 35:50.485
Um, so I did a sketch.

35:50.486 --> 35:53.549
That I think might be him.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.543
You think?

35:54.544 --> 35:57.664
You guys can tell me.

36:06.090 --> 36:07.950
Wow.

36:09.075 --> 36:10.812
Look at this photo.

36:10.813 --> 36:15.073
Now look at this sketch. You tell me.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.005
So I did a sketch.

36:35.006 --> 36:38.486
That I think might be him.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.629
Wow.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.972
Look at this photo.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.775
Now look at this sketch.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.236
You tell me.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.940
The same.. Cruel mouth.

37:11.575 --> 37:13.898
The same boxer-like nose.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.233
And ears.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.234
Yeah, the long ears.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.037
- She has him.
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.038 --> 37:24.258
I would say that's him.

37:24.259 --> 37:25.936
I can feel it.

37:25.937 --> 37:28.337
It's weird.

37:30.046 --> 37:34.084
I'm just, like, freaked out a little bit.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.454
What would bring him to the house?

37:36.455 --> 37:38.675
I think..

37:38.966 --> 37:41.906
He, uh, killed her.

37:42.862 --> 37:47.203
He was at the top of the stairs,
picked her up, and threw her.

37:47.204 --> 37:49.604
Oh, my God.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.042
One of the things that I did get,

37:55.043 --> 37:59.977
um, was that he did attempt to
make it look like an accident.

37:59.978 --> 38:04.054
My gut and my investigative background..

38:04.055 --> 38:08.419
I wouldn't doubt that this guy was
capable of doing what he did.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.389
I don't know might possess a man
to come looking for his daughter

38:11.390 --> 38:12.924
and kill her in cold blood.

38:12.925 --> 38:16.761
But as a former Detective, I've
seen this plenty of times before.

38:16.762 --> 38:21.360
You said that you heard him
laughing, uh, about this..

38:21.361 --> 38:23.401
The.. The fact that he
knew what he had done?

38:23.402 --> 38:24.569
Oh, yeah.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.080
He was very proud of himself.

38:27.081 --> 38:29.230
Well, I'll be.

38:29.231 --> 38:32.951
I never even.. Dreamt of that.

38:34.157 --> 38:36.780
This evil man continues
to haunt this location..

38:36.781 --> 38:42.681
Because he wants to keep the events
surrounding his daughter's death unknown.

38:44.388 --> 38:47.625
Well, Doctor, now we're gonna answer
your most pressing question..

38:47.626 --> 38:48.960
Is it safe for you here?

38:48.961 --> 38:53.464
And is there a way to stop some of these
spirits scaring away your patients?

38:53.465 --> 38:58.025
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:58.435 --> 39:02.904
The first thing that I would recommend
is getting rid of her Father.

39:02.905 --> 39:07.295
He needs to be removed from the location.

39:07.296 --> 39:13.169
I have some things that I brought that I
felt would be good for getting him out.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.350
This is a blend of natural herbs.

39:15.351 --> 39:19.235
Something that you burn and you can
walk through the house with it.

39:19.236 --> 39:23.123
It's for home blessing and protection.

39:23.124 --> 39:25.945
And then we have some holy water.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.116
He's not gonna like this at all.

39:29.117 --> 39:33.917
This is going to make
him very uncomfortable.

39:34.338 --> 39:38.804
And then the last thing
we have is black salt.

39:38.805 --> 39:42.172
That's going to keep him out.

39:42.173 --> 39:45.999
And you wanna do this once
every day for a week.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.520
So he knows that he's not
allowed back in that house.

39:52.490 --> 39:55.788
After you deal with him.

39:55.789 --> 40:00.949
The next step is going to
be connecting with her.

40:02.367 --> 40:06.631
Having a talk with her,
and letting her know..

40:06.632 --> 40:10.025
That it's okay for her to go.

40:10.026 --> 40:12.923
It may take several months.

40:12.924 --> 40:16.981
Because you guys are so attached
to each other, to work through it.

40:16.982 --> 40:20.456
And you may see a lot of changes with her.

40:20.457 --> 40:26.357
And they'll be positive changes as
she's getting ready to.. To leave.

40:26.594 --> 40:29.715
So does he just tell her,
"you should go, move on"?

40:29.716 --> 40:31.314
Or what does he.. What does he tell her?

40:31.315 --> 40:33.247
Well, it's kind of like
sitting down and being like..

40:33.248 --> 40:35.178
"You know, we.. We know the truth.

40:35.179 --> 40:37.002
We know what happened to you".

40:37.003 --> 40:39.606
Because it really validates them.

40:39.607 --> 40:42.589
To be acknowledged and
have their stories heard.

40:42.590 --> 40:46.891
That's one of the most
important things for the dead.

40:46.892 --> 40:49.898
Karen, h.. How does all this
information make you feel?

40:49.899 --> 40:52.467
I mean, do you feel validated?

40:52.468 --> 40:54.017
Yes.

40:54.018 --> 40:56.827
I think..
I think we've got some closure now.

40:56.828 --> 40:58.097
Okay.

40:58.098 --> 41:00.015
Doc, are you gonna be able to let her go?

41:00.016 --> 41:01.469
Because you're..
You're really, like, almost

41:01.470 --> 41:05.670
a fatherly figure right now with her.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.715
I have to.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.038
It's.. It's for her.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.247
It's for her.

41:15.248 --> 41:16.891
It's not me. It's her.

41:16.892 --> 41:20.272
I'll miss her, but I certainly wouldn't
miss him for one split second.

41:20.273 --> 41:22.913
No not at all.

41:26.085 --> 41:27.888
Even though it may look bizarre to you..

41:27.889 --> 41:29.405
It looks bizarre to me..

41:29.406 --> 41:32.590
Just promise me you'll take her advice.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.691
I will.

41:35.208 --> 41:37.840
I really hope that Dr.
Grimes follows through..

41:37.841 --> 41:40.774
And cleanses the house of the angry Father.

41:40.775 --> 41:46.675
Even if it means letting go of the
little girl he's grown so attached to.
