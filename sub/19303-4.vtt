WEBVTT

00:16.768 --> 00:18.228
Good evening.

00:18.395 --> 00:22.107
We are here tonight
to talk about violence.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.944
Or maybe human nature.

00:28.363 --> 00:32.867
We are here to talk about human nature.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.704
Wait.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.872
A quote.

00:38.331 --> 00:40.500
A great philosopher once wrote:

00:40.667 --> 00:46.673
"In times of peace,
the warlike man attacks himself."

00:46.840 --> 00:50.385
This is the root of all our problems.

00:50.552 --> 00:52.721
And by this...

00:53.722 --> 00:55.724
...I mean we.

00:55.932 --> 00:59.352
We are the root of all our problems.

00:59.519 --> 01:03.148
Our confusion, our anger...

01:03.314 --> 01:07.360
...our fear of things we don't understand.

01:07.527 --> 01:12.907
Violence, in other words, is ignorance.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.492
Figure your shit out.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.411
That's my....

01:16.661 --> 01:18.621
What I'd say.

01:35.597 --> 01:39.309
There are two kinds of stories
we tell our children.

01:39.476 --> 01:41.478
The first kind:

01:41.644 --> 01:45.148
Once upon a time
there was a fuzzy little rabbit...

01:45.315 --> 01:46.983
...named Frizzy-top...

01:47.150 --> 01:50.445
...who went
on a quantum-fun adventure...

01:50.612 --> 01:53.531
...only to face a big setback...

01:53.698 --> 01:59.871
...which he overcame through perseverance
and by being adorable.

02:00.163 --> 02:03.875
This kind of story teaches empathy.

02:04.042 --> 02:09.297
Put yourself in Frizzy-top's shoes,
in other words.

02:10.507 --> 02:12.759
The other kind:

02:13.301 --> 02:14.886
Oliver Anthony Bird...

02:15.053 --> 02:19.974
...if you get too close to that ocean
you'll be sucked into the sea and drowned.

02:20.350 --> 02:24.562
This kind of story teaches them fear.

02:25.396 --> 02:30.318
And for the rest of their lives
these two stories compete.

02:30.777 --> 02:35.031
Empathy and fear.

02:36.616 --> 02:40.453
And so I bring you tonight's play.

02:40.745 --> 02:45.458
A work in five acts
about a fuzzy little bunny...

02:45.708 --> 02:48.628
...who got too close to the ocean...

02:49.170 --> 02:51.923
...and what happened next.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.968
Let us begin.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.524
<i>We went looking for truth...</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:15.029
<i>...but found only lies.</i>

03:22.620 --> 03:24.622
<i>The doctor had disappeared.</i>

03:29.210 --> 03:32.547
<i>The old girlfriend hid behind a smile.</i>

03:34.424 --> 03:36.426
<i>What was real?</i>

03:36.885 --> 03:37.927
<i>That was the mission.</i>

03:39.429 --> 03:41.347
<i>We had seen things.</i>

03:42.807 --> 03:44.893
<i>Heard things.</i>

03:45.059 --> 03:47.228
<i>But could we believe our eyes?</i>

03:47.395 --> 03:49.314
<i>Could David?</i>

03:49.981 --> 03:51.900
<i>David?</i>

03:53.443 --> 03:55.820
<i>What do the stars say?</i>

03:58.281 --> 04:00.533
<i>My boy.</i>

04:02.660 --> 04:04.495
<i>My beautiful boy.</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:09.667
<i>David?</i>

04:09.834 --> 04:11.628
<i>Wake up.</i>

04:13.087 --> 04:15.131
<i>Wake up.</i>

04:19.052 --> 04:20.678
Odd.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.141
Extremely.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.684
He's gonna wake up, right?

04:26.851 --> 04:29.437
There is no medical reason
David's unconscious.

04:29.604 --> 04:32.106
If that's what he is.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.108
<i>Andromeda.</i>

04:35.318 --> 04:36.903
<i>Cassiopeia.</i>

04:40.657 --> 04:42.033
<i>I'm getting out tomorrow.</i>

04:43.618 --> 04:45.787
<i>Kissinger says I'm clean...</i>

04:47.622 --> 04:48.790
<i>...so I get to go home.</i>

04:49.082 --> 04:52.669
- No!
<i>- David, wake up.</i>

04:55.338 --> 04:58.549
- I could try a shot of adrenaline.
- No.

04:59.634 --> 05:01.594
- Too risky.
- Agreed.

05:01.761 --> 05:03.471
<i>David?</i>

05:03.888 --> 05:06.182
<i>David, where are you?</i>

05:08.017 --> 05:10.019
<i>You've gotta get better.</i>

05:10.186 --> 05:11.562
<i>So you can come home too.</i>

05:16.609 --> 05:18.027
<i>David?</i>

05:18.319 --> 05:20.071
<i>Wake up.</i>

05:23.032 --> 05:24.575
He's not inside his memories.

05:24.951 --> 05:27.787
His subconscious. I looked.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.872
Wherever his mind is, I can't find it.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.208
- But he's not--
- He's not brain-dead, no.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.711
His mind is active.
What's it doing, though?

05:35.920 --> 05:39.257
We know he can create
a kind of mental projection space.

05:39.424 --> 05:42.135
Something between reality and dream.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.096
An astral plane.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.600
We've been inside David's memories
three times.

05:51.144 --> 05:55.023
Three times we saw glitches, omissions.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.401
It's as if we've activated
some kind of guardian.

05:58.568 --> 06:01.696
There's something in David's memory
he does not want us to see.

06:01.863 --> 06:02.864
- Kerry.
- Yes.

06:03.031 --> 06:05.950
I have a mission for you.
Three of you. I'm sending you out.

06:06.701 --> 06:10.413
We need to find out what happened
to David before he went to Clockworks.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.584
<i>- What about Division Three?
- It's just a risk we'll have to take.</i>

06:14.876 --> 06:16.044
<i>He's too important.</i>

06:16.210 --> 06:19.338
Is he, though? Because I'm thinking
"dangerous" is a better word.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.925
<i>I think he's annoying,
but if I get to kick a few people, I'm in.</i>

06:23.551 --> 06:25.470
You're all going.

06:27.722 --> 06:28.806
<i>What was real?</i>

06:30.183 --> 06:32.268
<i>That was the mission.</i>

06:32.560 --> 06:35.730
Keep an eye out. We can't stay long.

06:38.316 --> 06:43.780
Just a guess, but I'd say Dr. Poole
hasn't been here in a few years.

06:47.158 --> 06:48.242
It's weird.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.497
<i>Seeing it after visiting David's memory.</i>

06:52.997 --> 06:55.416
The curtains are completely different.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.087
Most people's memories are unreliable.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.964
The things we see, that people say.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.467
And they change over time too.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.844
Your past is an illusion.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.807
There was a tear right there.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.519
The wall opened up.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.146
That red light came out.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.483
And the boy ran into the closet...

07:20.775 --> 07:21.818
...and I followed.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.277
Wait!

07:23.444 --> 07:24.946
<i>Into the astral plane.</i>

07:25.113 --> 07:26.781
The invented space.

07:26.948 --> 07:30.576
I looked for you. You weren't
in any memories of David I could find.

07:30.743 --> 07:33.162
Are you saying David created that space?

07:33.329 --> 07:35.915
It's part of his ability, psychic projection.

07:36.082 --> 07:38.501
To create a simulated reality.

07:39.544 --> 07:43.464
Okay, let's see what she has to say.

07:44.799 --> 07:46.926
- Who?
- The room.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.767
There you are.

07:59.939 --> 08:01.566
Objects have memory too.

08:01.732 --> 08:06.154
Is there any way...?
Could we still be in David's mind?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.489
The simulation?

08:08.656 --> 08:09.740
No. This is real.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.910
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

08:13.536 --> 08:17.915
I mean, I'm pretty sure.

08:18.499 --> 08:22.420
- How do you--?
- Put your hand here.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.345
Watch it.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.766
I won't touch you. It's not my first day.
Just....

08:36.517 --> 08:38.561
Close your eyes.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.782
<i>Cassiopeia.</i>

08:54.744 --> 08:56.913
<i>Bo√∂tes.</i>

08:57.246 --> 08:59.290
<i>Canis Major.</i>

08:59.624 --> 09:01.500
<i>Lupus.</i>

09:02.627 --> 09:04.629
<i>Telescopia.</i>

09:07.548 --> 09:08.674
Tell me, David.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.593
What did the stars say?

09:23.022 --> 09:24.941
Did he...?

09:25.107 --> 09:30.529
Looks like the doctor came back
while David was robbing the place.

09:34.492 --> 09:36.744
That doesn't sound like David.

09:37.161 --> 09:41.207
I know you like him, but he's not stable.
Trust me.

09:41.374 --> 09:43.960
You try hearing voices for 10, 15 years...

09:44.126 --> 09:47.463
...self-medicate with hard drugs,
and then get dumped in a loony bin.

09:47.630 --> 09:48.839
I was in a loony bin.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.925
Yeah, but you're--

09:51.259 --> 09:54.303
I mean, no offense,
but compared to him, his power...

09:54.470 --> 09:56.597
...you're a card trick.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.685
I read the report.

10:02.061 --> 10:04.397
He broke the doctor's skull.

10:04.563 --> 10:07.400
They had to put the guy in a coma
to get the swelling down.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.026
And that was with his fists.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.696
Imagine if he used his power.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.948
He's a bomb.

10:22.832 --> 10:25.584
What did the stars say?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.211
- What?
- Dr. Poole asked David:

10:27.378 --> 10:29.714
"What did the stars say?"

10:30.631 --> 10:32.675
And I saw him.

10:32.842 --> 10:35.136
When we were in his mind.

10:35.303 --> 10:40.057
Just before the monster came, I saw him.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.601
Like a flash. He had--

10:42.768 --> 10:46.147
He was stuffing tape into his mouth,
audio tape, and his hands were--

10:46.314 --> 10:47.565
- You're saying--
- Glitches.

10:49.859 --> 10:52.153
Omissions.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.657
You've seen his memories.
There are rips in them. Gaps.

10:57.992 --> 11:01.078
- What if--?
- I've seen implanted memories before.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.330
You can always tell.

11:02.496 --> 11:06.167
Implanted from the outside.
I'm talking about....

11:06.375 --> 11:09.587
He's so powerful. David.

11:10.296 --> 11:13.382
Maybe he's hidden his real memories
behind fake ones.

11:13.549 --> 11:16.844
- Why?
- I don't know.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.812
A lot of effort just to convince yourself
your boyfriend's a nice guy.

11:26.979 --> 11:30.900
Conversations on tape.
"What did the stars say?"

11:32.651 --> 11:34.195
We know he's hiding things.

11:34.362 --> 11:36.405
<i>One last job and we're out.</i>

11:36.572 --> 11:40.576
What if he didn't come in here
to steal a radio or some coins?

11:40.868 --> 11:44.830
What if he came here
to get rid of evidence?

11:44.997 --> 11:49.668
A conversation.
The one time he said too much.

12:01.138 --> 12:04.767
<i>How do you find the facts
when memory becomes a dream?</i>

12:04.934 --> 12:06.185
<i>David.</i>

12:07.395 --> 12:10.314
<i>Alice went down the rabbit hole.</i>

12:10.481 --> 12:12.817
<i>Dorothy landed in Oz.</i>

12:13.109 --> 12:15.027
<i>Or did she?</i>

12:18.280 --> 12:20.491
<i>I was looking for the man I loved.</i>

12:25.121 --> 12:27.790
<i>Or did I just love the idea of him?</i>

12:28.582 --> 12:30.709
<i>The face he showed me.</i>

12:34.880 --> 12:37.258
<i>All I could do was follow the lines...</i>

12:38.175 --> 12:39.885
<i>...pull the string.</i>

12:42.388 --> 12:44.181
<i>The things he'd done.</i>

12:45.224 --> 12:47.309
<i>The things he'd said.</i>

12:48.769 --> 12:52.731
<i>Who are we
if not the stories we tell ourselves?</i>

13:47.745 --> 13:49.455
Hello?

13:50.456 --> 13:52.416
Who's that?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.754
I'm here.

13:56.921 --> 13:59.006
I exist!

13:59.215 --> 14:01.509
I'm in a cell!

14:08.224 --> 14:10.226
We should speak quietly.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.771
They might be listening.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.482
Who?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.529
Tell me your name.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.242
Amy.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.535
Haller.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.411
My God.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.497
The sister.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.416
Who are you?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.210
My name is Kissinger.

14:36.377 --> 14:39.338
- I was--
- David's doctor.

14:39.505 --> 14:43.092
I went to the hospital to look for you.
They said you didn't exist.

14:43.259 --> 14:44.969
I do.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.805
I used to.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.974
Have they...?

14:51.308 --> 14:53.060
Did you tell them where he is?

14:53.227 --> 14:54.353
No.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.146
I don't know.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.774
I haven't seen him since....

14:59.483 --> 15:02.444
- Did you?
- No.

15:02.903 --> 15:07.408
After he left the hospital
he stayed with us for a few nights.

15:20.588 --> 15:23.007
Did you know...

15:24.008 --> 15:26.093
...he wasn't sick?

15:26.844 --> 15:28.178
That he had powers?

15:33.517 --> 15:36.812
<i>He spoke of voices, visions.</i>

15:39.315 --> 15:40.357
<i>Did you?</i>

15:44.945 --> 15:46.989
I think so.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.076
I should have.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.704
<i>For years.</i>

15:53.871 --> 15:56.874
<i>Doctors, hospitals.</i>

15:57.583 --> 16:01.045
<i>God. He was so sweet.</i>

16:02.463 --> 16:03.797
<i>But he--</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:05.799
<i>He moved.</i>

16:07.426 --> 16:13.390
From room to room, sometimes further.
You'd hear his voice and you'd follow it.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.684
<i>He wouldn't be there.</i>

16:16.101 --> 16:17.394
<i>And he knew things.</i>

16:17.811 --> 16:20.356
Conversations he couldn't have heard.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.232
More than conversations.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.442
Thoughts.

16:24.401 --> 16:28.155
<i>I'd catch him talking to people
who weren't there.</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:31.033
Who are you talking to?

16:31.200 --> 16:35.621
- And he would say, "King."
- The dog.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.082
<i>Your dog.</i>

16:38.457 --> 16:41.627
<i>- David spoke of him often.
- Doctor...</i>

16:45.047 --> 16:47.216
...we didn't have a dog.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.781
<i>If you come with me,
you are gonna see things.</i>

17:21.917 --> 17:24.420
<i>You will not feel the same about me.</i>

17:54.366 --> 17:57.953
Cary called,
he found an address for Philly.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.290
Hey, Syd.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.167
Syd.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.253
Cary called,
he found an address for the girlfriend.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.505
Ex-girlfriend.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.341
Mm-hm.

18:11.925 --> 18:17.389
So you live inside his body?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.766
We share.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.977
Is that weird?

18:23.020 --> 18:25.689
I'll tell you a story.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.108
Ray and Irma Whitecloud.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.695
They're having their first kid.
And it's a girl. A native girl.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.448
They decide to name her Kerry.

18:34.907 --> 18:37.201
Nine months later...

18:37.701 --> 18:39.244
...a skinny white boy comes out.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.622
Ray decides Irma had an affair.

18:41.789 --> 18:44.583
He leaves her.
So now Irma's a single mother...

18:44.750 --> 18:47.711
...raising this bastard runt.

18:47.878 --> 18:54.760
Then, eight years later,
little boy Cary wakes up in his room....

18:59.431 --> 19:06.480
<i>And there is an 8-year-old native girl
playing with his train set.</i>

19:08.315 --> 19:10.984
So for the next year
he thinks maybe he made her up.

19:11.151 --> 19:16.031
Like his imaginary friend
who comes and goes.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.659
But then he figures out that...

19:19.952 --> 19:22.496
<i>...she lives inside of him.</i>

19:24.957 --> 19:31.004
<i>That they're two people in one body.</i>

19:35.509 --> 19:37.386
<i>That's his side. What about you?</i>

19:38.262 --> 19:40.013
What do you mean?

19:42.850 --> 19:45.435
You're a person too.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.021
With feelings.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.316
I'm asking what it's like for you.

19:54.945 --> 19:57.656
He does the boring stuff, okay?

19:57.823 --> 19:59.074
Eating, sleeping.

19:59.241 --> 20:05.122
Whatever it is you guys do in the bathroom,
and I get all the action.

20:06.832 --> 20:09.042
He makes me laugh, and I keep him safe.

20:09.209 --> 20:13.672
If that's weird...

20:15.048 --> 20:17.050
...I'm okay with it.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.269
<i>Electrical malfunction.</i>

20:27.436 --> 20:29.313
<i>Are you sure you're up for this?</i>

20:29.479 --> 20:32.024
<i>Don't worry, we'll get the facts.</i>

20:33.108 --> 20:35.652
It's just a risk we'll have to take.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.095
A diving suit. You're sure?

21:02.262 --> 21:03.764
It's not just coincidence.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.933
With David gone.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.728
Maybe he's waking up.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.314
Maybe, but don't get your hopes up.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.942
We've been wrong before.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.699
Do you miss her?

21:23.075 --> 21:24.701
Kerry?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.455
Is that dumb?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.207
No.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.668
<i>It's sweet.</i>

21:33.377 --> 21:36.505
<i>It so amazes me how she only ages
when she's outside your body.</i>

21:36.672 --> 21:40.050
I know, and here I am getting old.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.844
What happens to her when I die,
I wonder?

21:49.059 --> 21:50.769
Is he--?

21:51.061 --> 21:52.479
He's still here.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.065
His body.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.443
Ah-ah-ah.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.531
Oliver.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.244
It's me.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.579
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:10.163 --> 22:11.623
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:12.332 --> 22:14.418
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:14.584 --> 22:16.628
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:16.795 --> 22:18.922
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:19.089 --> 22:21.216
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:21.383 --> 22:23.885
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

22:24.386 --> 22:25.929
<i>Unannounced--</i>

22:26.972 --> 22:28.473
- What was it?
- Nothing.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.143
I told you we need to replace
this operating system.

22:31.309 --> 22:32.686
No.

22:32.853 --> 22:34.146
He's trying to reach us.

22:36.023 --> 22:38.316
We could hear you, my love.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.238
Come back to us.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.014
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:09.181 --> 23:11.183
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:11.349 --> 23:13.477
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:13.643 --> 23:15.687
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:15.854 --> 23:18.065
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:18.231 --> 23:20.233
<i>Unannounced visitor.</i>

23:20.400 --> 23:22.277
<i>Unannounced--</i>

23:42.339 --> 23:43.965
Wait.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.157
Drink?

25:33.408 --> 25:34.451
Uh....

25:35.202 --> 25:37.037
Sure.

25:39.039 --> 25:42.209
What's real in this space
is whatever you want it to be.

25:42.375 --> 25:47.339
So my feeling is why not wait in style?

25:47.797 --> 25:49.591
Wait for what?

25:49.758 --> 25:51.676
Where are we?

25:52.594 --> 25:53.970
Sorry about the cold.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.432
It's the only thing
I can't seem to fix in here.

25:58.183 --> 26:01.937
Oh. Would you like to listen to something?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.583
It's, um--

26:24.793 --> 26:26.962
Hey, dig that groove.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.256
Ah, it's genius.

26:29.965 --> 26:31.424
Can you--?

26:35.804 --> 26:37.347
Could you turn it off?

26:40.517 --> 26:42.185
Sorry.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.729
I forgot about your, um....

26:45.897 --> 26:48.858
I had a similar proclivity.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.068
Malady.

26:50.235 --> 26:52.654
I forget the word. What's the word?

26:53.071 --> 26:58.076
I've been here a long time
and things tend to, uh...

26:59.786 --> 27:00.954
...drift.

27:01.121 --> 27:02.789
Right.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.835
And here is...?

27:10.422 --> 27:13.091
See, I was-- They gave me a shot.

27:13.258 --> 27:17.262
A sedative. For the memory work,
and when I woke up, I was--

27:18.638 --> 27:21.266
Unless I'm not really awake.

27:22.309 --> 27:23.893
Maybe this is the drug.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.812
Tell me something, do they still, uh...?

27:25.979 --> 27:27.314
Is free love still a thing?

27:27.480 --> 27:30.066
Girls in summer dresses with no bra?

27:31.651 --> 27:34.279
Not really. It's definitely....

27:34.446 --> 27:35.488
Bras are back.

27:37.782 --> 27:38.867
Too bad.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.453
So....

27:42.203 --> 27:44.497
Oh. Yes, right.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.041
Well....

27:46.207 --> 27:49.586
There's good news and there's bad news.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.339
The bad news is it's not the drug.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.673
You're here.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.300
In the astral plane.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.969
You went too far into the make-believe
and got lost.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.139
Your mind. Consciousness.

28:01.765 --> 28:06.394
And now you're trapped
in this no place...

28:06.561 --> 28:08.646
...where every day is the same...

28:08.813 --> 28:11.358
...where you can
imaginify yourself a kingdom...

28:11.524 --> 28:13.651
...but nothing is ever real.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.281
And what's the good news?

28:18.448 --> 28:22.077
I'm not alone anymore.
How do you feel about beat poetry?

28:23.370 --> 28:29.209
<i>I went to the neon fruit supermarket
Dreaming of your enumerations</i>

28:29.376 --> 28:33.004
<i>What peaches and what penumbras</i>

28:33.171 --> 28:36.508
<i>Whole families shopping at night</i>

28:36.674 --> 28:41.096
<i>Aisles full of husbands
Wives and the avocados</i>

28:41.262 --> 28:42.472
<i>Babies and the tomatoes--</i>

28:42.639 --> 28:44.849
Uh, sir.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.560
Oliver. Please.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.146
Don't worry.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.441
He can't get you in here.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.404
- He?
- Your monster.

28:58.947 --> 28:59.989
Ah.

29:00.448 --> 29:03.410
He makes you forget. Clever.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.830
- What are you--?
- You have an unquiet mind...

29:06.996 --> 29:13.461
...and so you war with yourself,
like a dog trying to chew off its own tail.

29:14.462 --> 29:19.592
- Like I said, I've seen it before.
- I'm-- I was schizophrenic, I thought.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.262
But Melanie said
it was because of my powers.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.888
Melanie.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.223
I knew a Melanie once.

29:26.224 --> 29:29.519
You know what? I gotta get out of here.
Back to the-- They need me.

29:29.686 --> 29:30.895
Amy needs me.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.272
Amy, your girlfriend.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.774
No, your sister.

29:35.191 --> 29:38.111
- How do you--?
- I wouldn't go out there.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.696
It's waiting.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.239
The monster.

29:41.781 --> 29:45.118
You brought it in here,
and now it's hunting you.

29:45.285 --> 29:48.455
There is no monster. It's just me.
I know that.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.791
It's just me. It's my psychology.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.169
Mm.... Monster as metaphor. I like it.

29:54.335 --> 29:55.378
But wrong.

29:55.545 --> 29:58.131
It's part of you, that's true,
but not like a symptom.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.091
More like a...

30:00.633 --> 30:01.718
...parasite.

30:03.845 --> 30:07.307
- Are you saying I'm haunted?
- No. That's superstition. I'm a scientist.

30:07.474 --> 30:10.268
I'm saying maybe it's good you're here.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.645
Figure some things out.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.189
Defeat the dragon.

30:14.355 --> 30:18.109
Unless, you know, the dragon wins.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.613
Listen, I can't just-- People need me.
Syd and Amy.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.282
So I am gonna get out of this place.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.326
- I am not waiting.
- How?

30:26.493 --> 30:30.330
I don't know. But apparently
I'm this super-powerful mutant...

30:30.497 --> 30:33.333
...so I'm guessing
I'll figure something out.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.887
Pity.

30:46.095 --> 30:49.516
Two more and we could have had
a barbershop quartet.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.439
Right.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.858
I'll watch for you as best I can...

30:59.025 --> 31:02.445
...but things get muddy out there
in the vast subconscious.

31:02.904 --> 31:08.034
Remember,
it's not real unless you make it real.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.045
Come back any time.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.130
Wednesday is karaoke night.

31:47.865 --> 31:50.994
<i>We moved through a city of normals.</i>

31:51.578 --> 31:54.455
<i>Soldiers in a secret war.</i>

31:54.872 --> 31:59.502
<i>We were the ghosts in a haunted house,
the golem of myth.</i>

31:59.669 --> 32:04.799
<i>To the normal, we were just superstition,
make-believe.</i>

32:05.049 --> 32:07.427
<i>Sometimes it felt like that to us too.</i>

32:12.181 --> 32:13.850
<i>To me...</i>

32:14.392 --> 32:17.520
<i>...I was a woman
who couldn't be touched.</i>

32:20.231 --> 32:23.359
<i>In love with a man who wasn't there.</i>

32:25.945 --> 32:27.947
<i>What was real?</i>

32:29.490 --> 32:33.328
<i>The old girlfriend, that was the mission.</i>

32:34.412 --> 32:37.790
I need you to take the lead,
so I can scan her.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.208
Scan her?

32:39.375 --> 32:43.296
I'll look through her memories while
you keep her busy. I need 30 to 40 minutes.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.674
How am I supposed to keep her busy
for 30 to 40 minutes?

32:46.841 --> 32:48.676
Buy a house.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.845
If you see anything, just whistle.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.640
There's gonna be some fighting soon,
right?

32:54.432 --> 32:58.978
To fight and conquer in all your battles
is not supreme excellence.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.857
Supreme excellence consists
in breaking the enemy's resistance...

33:03.024 --> 33:04.692
...without fighting.

33:04.859 --> 33:06.527
- Whatever.
- Oh....

33:08.488 --> 33:09.989
And I'm blind.

33:10.156 --> 33:14.118
And are we looking for a one-bedroom
or a two-bedroom?

33:14.786 --> 33:15.912
Kids.

33:16.079 --> 33:17.372
We're hoping to have kids.

33:17.538 --> 33:20.166
Oh, wow. Congratulations.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.130
<i>No, no, no.</i>

33:26.297 --> 33:28.174
No, we're not, um...

33:28.341 --> 33:29.384
...having kids.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.177
It's just, uh....

33:31.761 --> 33:33.012
We're talking.

33:34.389 --> 33:38.893
Oh, well, you don't get them
just by talking. Ha, ha, ha!

33:39.644 --> 33:42.397
So I know it's a stretch
of our price range...

33:42.563 --> 33:45.274
...but we were thinking about something
on the west side.

33:45.441 --> 33:49.821
Great.
You wanna take a look at some places....

34:05.628 --> 34:06.879
More coffee?

34:07.046 --> 34:09.632
Oh, no. I've got a hard enough time sleeping
as it is.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.676
David has the same problem.

34:11.843 --> 34:13.886
He's always tossing and turning.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.222
And sometimes he talks in his sleep.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.100
We don't have to-- It's not a session.

34:19.267 --> 34:23.229
He's right. But I'd like to hear more
about this dog you're thinking of getting.

34:23.396 --> 34:26.399
His name is Archie.
David had a beagle when he was a kid.

34:26.566 --> 34:29.402
King. His name was King,
he went with me, like, everywhere.

34:29.777 --> 34:33.448
He sounds like just the cutest thing.
I keep asking for pictures, but--

34:33.823 --> 34:36.117
Amy must have some.
I don't keep a lot of stuff.

34:36.284 --> 34:37.326
A lot?

34:37.493 --> 34:40.955
We're talking nothing.
No pictures, no favorite teddy bear.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.958
No evidence he was ever....

34:44.125 --> 34:47.044
You know, heh, heh, had a past.

34:57.305 --> 34:58.848
...evidence, he was ever....

34:59.015 --> 35:01.309
You know, heh, had a past.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.954
So, uh, you wanna take a tour?

35:22.371 --> 35:26.042
No, thanks.
I think we found what we were looking for.

35:26.209 --> 35:29.170
I'm sorry. You look so familiar.

35:29.337 --> 35:32.507
- Did you date someone named David?
- Syd.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.551
Are you friends of his?

35:39.514 --> 35:40.973
Do you know where he is?

35:41.849 --> 35:44.310
No. We....

35:44.477 --> 35:46.521
We're looking for him actually.

35:47.230 --> 35:50.900
But I just wanted you to know
he said such nice things about you.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.861
Did he--?

35:54.237 --> 35:57.198
Did things end badly with you guys?

35:57.698 --> 35:59.116
It's--

36:00.034 --> 36:01.661
I thought I could fix him.

36:01.828 --> 36:04.205
He was so troubled, you know.

36:05.248 --> 36:07.792
He was always nice to me.

36:08.793 --> 36:11.045
But then he went off his medication.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.089
He had this friend. Benny.

36:13.548 --> 36:15.508
<i>- You mean Lenny.
- No. Benny.</i>

36:15.675 --> 36:17.176
<i>He was a....</i>

36:17.677 --> 36:19.428
Pusher, I guess.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.639
David's friend,
the one he did drugs with--

36:21.931 --> 36:23.599
Unhand the reptile, space captain.

36:23.766 --> 36:26.894
Hey, now, don't fight.

36:27.061 --> 36:28.104
--was a man.

36:28.271 --> 36:30.523
Yeah. A big guy.

36:30.690 --> 36:34.193
He smiled a lot, but not with his eyes.

36:35.736 --> 36:39.907
If I see him, is there anything
that you wanna say? A message?

36:44.704 --> 36:46.539
Tell him...

36:48.958 --> 36:50.126
...they're watching.

37:02.889 --> 37:04.807
Are we gonna talk about Benny?

37:04.974 --> 37:06.267
You saw the memories.

37:06.434 --> 37:08.519
Everywhere we went
it was David and Lenny...

37:08.686 --> 37:10.730
...his old female friend from the hospital.

37:10.897 --> 37:13.566
Who I buried in a wall. How'd she end up
stitched in David's memory?

37:13.733 --> 37:15.693
This would be an awesome place
to have a fight.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.321
I don't know.
But whoever altered David's memory...

37:18.487 --> 37:20.364
...replaced the real dude with Lenny.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.034
Helicopters coming in, gunships.
Ninjas on fast ropes.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.243
- Heck, yeah.
- Why?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.745
I don't know.

37:25.912 --> 37:27.288
Let's ask the doctor.

37:32.919 --> 37:36.589
<i>Lenny, Benny, which one was real?</i>

37:36.756 --> 37:39.550
<i>Or were they one and the same?</i>

37:40.092 --> 37:42.595
<i>A man who became a woman.</i>

37:43.930 --> 37:46.682
<i>Or maybe it was just an illusion.</i>

37:47.767 --> 37:49.518
Dr. Poole.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.229
We're here about David Haller.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.650
- I don't talk about my patients.
- Please.

37:57.068 --> 37:59.195
He's in trouble.

37:59.570 --> 38:04.450
You told us that he broke into your office
to steal things so that he could buy drugs.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.243
We think there's another story.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.289
Doctor, five minutes...

38:10.456 --> 38:12.500
...and you'll never see us again.

38:26.097 --> 38:29.141
I swept upstairs. Nothing.

38:30.393 --> 38:31.769
Same drill.

38:31.936 --> 38:34.397
You talk, I'll search his memories.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.607
No. It's--

38:36.774 --> 38:38.567
We're not spies.

38:38.734 --> 38:41.529
If he's willing to talk, let's let him talk.

38:49.412 --> 38:52.665
- Thank you.
- Of course.

38:55.501 --> 38:59.797
So you're a lighthouse keeper now?

39:00.589 --> 39:03.217
I like to think I was always
a lighthouse keeper.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.303
How long did you treat David?

39:06.554 --> 39:08.764
On and off for three years.

39:08.931 --> 39:09.974
Why off?

39:10.141 --> 39:13.644
People with schizophrenia
are subject to delusional thinking.

39:13.811 --> 39:17.231
When David was on his medication,
he was open...

39:17.398 --> 39:20.026
...almost desperate to work.

39:20.568 --> 39:26.490
- But when he went off it....
- What about drugs or booze?

39:26.657 --> 39:30.578
He had conflicting impulses,
good and bad.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.538
There was a friend.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.165
A man or woman?

39:34.331 --> 39:35.833
A man.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.543
Benny.

39:38.169 --> 39:42.673
He had, I'd say, a negative effect
on David's treatment.

39:43.966 --> 39:48.137
Was he different at all, David,
before the break-in?

39:48.304 --> 39:50.097
Days or weeks?

39:50.264 --> 39:52.600
He doubled his sessions.

39:53.726 --> 39:58.064
It was clear that there were things
he wanted to say, but couldn't.

39:58.773 --> 40:00.107
Until his last appointment.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.318
Dr. Poole...

40:02.693 --> 40:04.445
...what did the stars say?

40:08.657 --> 40:10.743
You're in love with him.

40:13.829 --> 40:14.914
Yes.

40:17.541 --> 40:20.294
I'd very much like to see David again.

40:20.503 --> 40:22.379
Could you take me to him?

40:22.546 --> 40:26.425
- Why?
- Because I have the same question you do.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.804
I had a wife, kids.

40:31.097 --> 40:34.266
Now I can't see out of one eye.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.851
I can't concentrate.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.645
He ruined my life.

40:39.647 --> 40:41.941
I just want to ask him why.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.033
So he's in charge?

40:51.200 --> 40:52.952
Nobody's in charge.

40:53.119 --> 40:54.203
We're here together.

40:56.205 --> 40:58.082
And Melanie Bird?

40:59.208 --> 41:01.377
Is she not the leader of your little band?

41:02.920 --> 41:05.297
What did you just say?

41:07.049 --> 41:08.634
It's a trap.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.600
- Shit.
- Upstairs.

41:53.429 --> 41:57.600
All day it was talk, talk, talk--

41:58.142 --> 41:59.268
My turn.

42:47.066 --> 42:54.865
<i>I had what I thought were clear
Open eyes, bright blue</i>

42:57.493 --> 43:01.205
<i>Vision of a lake</i>

43:01.372 --> 43:05.960
<i>Carryin' pictures to lay on you</i>

43:08.212 --> 43:11.006
<i>Close the blinds, let 'em in</i>

43:11.173 --> 43:18.055
<i>Don't mind openin'
It's the edge of love</i>

43:19.098 --> 43:23.560
<i>You can't un-think a thought</i>

43:23.727 --> 43:28.857
<i>Either it's there or not</i>

43:30.859 --> 43:35.823
<i>Shadows of the mountain</i>

43:35.990 --> 43:40.202
<i>Don't tell them what's under</i>

43:40.452 --> 43:44.665
<i>The breadth and the height</i>

43:44.832 --> 43:50.004
<i>Of an undiscovered first</i>

43:50.170 --> 43:54.508
<i>Shadows of the mountain</i>

43:54.675 --> 43:59.388
<i>Don't tell them what's in store</i>

43:59.555 --> 44:03.434
<i>The height and the breadth</i>

44:03.600 --> 44:08.981
<i>Is it wrong to want more?</i>

44:39.970 --> 44:42.431
We've been looking for you.

44:44.058 --> 44:46.060
That was a mistake.

45:06.663 --> 45:09.792
<i>Is this the right mountain</i>

45:11.460 --> 45:13.837
<i>For us to climb?</i>

45:16.006 --> 45:19.676
<i>Is this the way to live</i>

45:20.511 --> 45:23.138
<i>For you to be mine?</i>

45:25.557 --> 45:29.019
<i>Is this the way to live</i>

45:30.396 --> 45:33.023
<i>For me to be yours?</i>

45:35.442 --> 45:38.570
<i>Is this the way to live</i>

45:39.822 --> 45:43.200
<i>Is it wrong to want more?</i>

45:44.701 --> 45:52.459
<i>Is this the way to live for me to be yours?</i>

45:54.420 --> 46:02.052
<i>Is this the way to live?
Is it wrong to want more?</i>

46:05.264 --> 46:08.267
- Sir.
- Targets acquired.

46:08.434 --> 46:10.436
- The other?
- Secured but feisty.

46:10.602 --> 46:12.896
It's a trick. He's not-- Unh!

46:14.898 --> 46:17.192
Throw them in the vehicle.

46:17.901 --> 46:20.320
I'll take them back myself.

46:29.246 --> 46:31.039
<i>All good in the head now?</i>

46:33.876 --> 46:36.336
<i>You think you're safe here?</i>

46:38.255 --> 46:40.424
<i>With these clowns?</i>

46:41.550 --> 46:44.261
<i>Dreaming you're a mountain climber?</i>

46:51.185 --> 46:52.978
Look, it's your little room.

46:57.441 --> 46:58.775
I am not in the mood.

47:02.988 --> 47:05.866
Whoopsie. I guess we gotta talk.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.577
Kid.

47:08.744 --> 47:09.953
Hey, kid.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.413
Are you my friend?

47:11.580 --> 47:15.000
- Because I could really use--
- Yes, of course I'm your friend. Come on.

47:15.167 --> 47:20.547
It's just-- I'm Betsy Tough Love,
your mean friend.

47:20.756 --> 47:23.133
But don't worry, I love you.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.969
- Blow me.
- Don't swing that way, bro.

47:26.261 --> 47:29.014
But I could be talked into a circle jerk.

47:29.181 --> 47:33.769
That is if you can get it up in this place.

47:33.936 --> 47:38.440
I've been walking around,
looking for an exit like an idiot.

47:41.026 --> 47:45.364
All those years of practice
and now, poof, mission complete.

47:46.323 --> 47:47.533
I lost my mind.

47:47.699 --> 47:50.827
Yeah, well, you screwed up, kid.
I told you not to trust them.

47:50.994 --> 47:54.414
I mean,
what kind of a name is Summerland?

47:54.581 --> 47:58.460
You know, you let your guard down, man.
They gave you a shot and now we're here.

47:58.627 --> 48:00.254
No. He said it wasn't the drugs.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.589
Who?
Captain Nemo, in his giant ice cube?

48:02.756 --> 48:04.258
<i>Unannounced visitors.</i>

48:04.466 --> 48:07.219
They doped you up
and kicked you out of your own body...

48:07.386 --> 48:09.388
...to do who knows what.

48:09.555 --> 48:12.558
Uncle Fiddly with the glasses
and the angry girl inside him...

48:12.724 --> 48:17.062
- ...they could be fingering you right now.
- Who are you? Really.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.815
I'm you.

48:19.982 --> 48:21.692
I'm me.

48:21.900 --> 48:24.611
I'm everything you wanna be.

48:25.654 --> 48:27.364
Please.

48:27.864 --> 48:29.700
The truth.

48:33.245 --> 48:34.580
Here's the truth, pal...

48:34.746 --> 48:36.999
...we gotta get out of here. Okay?

48:37.165 --> 48:38.458
You and me.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.836
Because wherever you go, there I am.

48:41.003 --> 48:44.756
I can't hang out in this shit-stain no-place
much longer. I got things to do.

48:44.923 --> 48:49.511
- What does that mean?
- So I was thinking if you just concentrate...

48:49.678 --> 48:53.473
...or if together maybe we--

48:53.640 --> 48:55.183
Hey.

48:56.435 --> 48:59.313
Or maybe you need
a little more motivation.

49:00.439 --> 49:01.481
Wait, is that--?

49:01.648 --> 49:05.986
That's right. In the real world,
that guy's about to shank your girlfriend.

49:06.153 --> 49:07.571
- Or worse.
- Ugh.

49:07.738 --> 49:09.197
- Get mad.
- No.

49:09.364 --> 49:11.241
Oh, no.

49:12.826 --> 49:14.494
Come on. Let it come.

49:19.541 --> 49:22.377
Come on. Come on.

49:45.067 --> 49:46.568
Syd!

49:48.904 --> 49:50.447
Syd.

49:51.490 --> 49:53.075
Syd.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.544
It's okay. I'm here.

50:07.422 --> 50:08.715
It's okay.

50:08.882 --> 50:10.300
We were looking for you.

50:10.467 --> 50:12.094
I know. I got lost.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.846
Here, hold this. I'll check on the others.

50:44.292 --> 50:45.961
Ah! Oh....

50:46.837 --> 50:49.047
Run. I'll protect you. Go.

50:49.214 --> 50:50.549
Grab her!

50:51.717 --> 50:53.093
No.

51:10.026 --> 51:11.945
David.

51:16.658 --> 51:18.744
- Run!
- No. It's me.

51:20.829 --> 51:22.706
David.
