[Gambi] Previously
onBlack Lightning...

00:03.742 --> 00:05.570
Thirty years ago,
I came to Freeland
as an agent for the ASA.

00:05.614 --> 00:08.617
Their vaccine inadvertently
created metahumans.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.141
[Agent Odell]
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

00:11.185 --> 00:14.057
-Agent Odell--
-You wanted the job.
This is it.

00:14.101 --> 00:18.148
We're going to have to
sue the government for
the return of your loved ones.

00:18.192 --> 00:21.543
We need to raise
well over $500,000.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.893
[all grunting]

00:27.244 --> 00:28.419
Praise the Lord.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.160
The school board
found your replacement.

00:30.204 --> 00:35.035
I am honored to remain
at Garfield as a teacher.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.602
What could possibly
keep Jefferson Pierce

00:37.646 --> 00:41.476
away from Garfield High
after it was attacked?

00:41.519 --> 00:44.218
Jefferson Pierce
was already there.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.786
Discovering you have powers
must be mind-blowing
on so many levels.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.093
Which part do you want me
to deal with first, Mom?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.181
Watch your tone, young lady!

00:51.225 --> 00:52.704
[Jennifer grunts]

00:52.748 --> 00:54.663
-[crying in pain]
-Mom, are you okay?

00:54.706 --> 00:57.927
Now, the purpose
of Black Lightning
was to kill Tobias

00:57.970 --> 01:02.192
for literally shoving
my father's articles down his throat until he died.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.064
Detective Summers,
what do you got for me?

01:07.154 --> 01:08.677
[groans]

01:08.720 --> 01:10.157
-And why would I help you?
-I know who has the briefcase.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.073
-[beeping]
-I need the briefcase.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.291
Time to die.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.119
[gasps and screams]

[screaming]

01:20.254 --> 01:21.777
[grunting angrily]

01:35.138 --> 01:37.053
Ahhh! Let me go!

01:37.097 --> 01:38.272
Let me go!

01:38.315 --> 01:39.925
Roommate thinks
it's Green Light.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.406
I had to knock her out
with my nightstick
just to cuff her.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.148
What happened?
Start with
five milligrams lorazepam,

01:45.192 --> 01:47.629
-followed by
three milligrams...

-[siren wailing]
-Stop!

02:08.345 --> 02:11.435
[officer] Police. Stop!
We're not gonna hurt you.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.176
Come on.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.745
Don't make us.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.748
[woman] I gotta get home.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.187
I got to get home.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.363
[straining]

02:27.843 --> 02:29.497
Okay, okay.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.281
Okay, hell, I get it.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.544
-I gotta get home.
I gotta get home.
-Look, I wanna go home, too.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.026
Why don't you
just come with us?

02:37.069 --> 02:38.549
I gotta get home.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.942

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
I can't... I... [grunts]

[crackles]

02:45.208 --> 02:46.166
[thuds]

02:56.263 --> 02:59.135
Tell us why
you need to get home.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.919
Is there something
you need to get to?

03:00.963 --> 03:03.139
Is there someone
who's waiting for you?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.358
Tell me,

03:05.489 --> 03:06.577
what do you need?

03:08.927 --> 03:10.102
Let me help you.

03:13.845 --> 03:14.890
[electricity crackles]

03:34.344 --> 03:36.999
And this is the last one.
It's a camera from
inside the school.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.263
-[computer beeps]
-[static crackling]

03:40.307 --> 03:43.614
-[sighing]
-There isn't a single camera
inside or outside of Garfield

03:43.658 --> 03:46.530
that captured Tobias
or Syonide on school premises.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.100
[frustrated sigh]

03:51.143 --> 03:52.754
All right.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.147
Look, I know that the footage

03:55.191 --> 03:57.672
from my goggles
isn't admissible,

03:57.715 --> 03:59.500
but maybe if we just
show it to the police...

03:59.543 --> 04:02.720
I mean, it'll motivate them
to put more energy
behind finding him.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.419
They've been trying
to find Tobias for 30 years.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.421
-[static on record player]
-Energy might not
be the problem.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.292
So it's still all on us.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.511
Nothing's changed.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.861
Well, not nothing.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.167
Tobias has got Painkiller
and he's got that

04:15.211 --> 04:18.823
ASA briefcase of Proctor's,
which, according to
your Ms. Fowdy, contains hell.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.260
[jazz music playing]

04:21.348 --> 04:23.959
You know,
your pep talks need work.

04:24.002 --> 04:30.313
Okay, so Khalil,
he's still the best path
to finding Tobias.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.925
I just hope the kid I knew
is still in there somewhere.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.537
I don't think the kids
that he darted
would feel the same way.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.017
Well, speaking of which,
I could use
one of those darts.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.759
I've been trying to develop
an antidote based
on your blood sample,

04:41.803 --> 04:43.500
but you have
screwed up chemistry.

04:43.544 --> 04:46.068
I would prefer a dart
that hasn't been activated.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.591
Okay. Anything else?

04:48.679 --> 04:50.202
Don't let him kill you again.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.078
[R&B music playing
on headphones]

05:04.565 --> 05:05.348
[Tobias] Khalil.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.351
Khalil.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.180
Khalil!

05:12.355 --> 05:13.748
Man, I didn't hear you.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.489
You were focused, that's good.

05:17.621 --> 05:21.103
[sighs] Incredible focus
was one of Syonide's
best qualities.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.156
Run me through
the pick-up schedule
for protection money.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.464
Uh, money is paid on Monday.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.815
Whoa! Hey.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.035
-Man, what the hell.
-I didn't tell you
to let it go.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.478
Take it.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.444
-Go on.
-Money's paid on Monday.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.924
Delivered to consolidators
on Tue-- Ah!

05:59.968 --> 06:01.186
[imitates Khalil] Psst. Ah!

06:01.230 --> 06:03.145
You're a bit of a slow
learner, aren't you?

06:08.629 --> 06:09.630
Hmm.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.765
Paid Monday,
consolidated Tuesday,

06:14.809 --> 06:16.158
brought to me on Wednesday.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.594
I count it
and bring it to you. Ow.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.075
[Tobias] Hmm.

06:20.118 --> 06:23.383
It's important to have
a schedule and stick to it.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.428
With Syonide gone,
you're gonna have to man up.

06:25.472 --> 06:26.864
Do more.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.606
Burn what's left.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.784
[reporter] According to
Reverend Jeremiah Holt,

06:33.828 --> 06:36.004
after almost three decades,

06:36.047 --> 06:38.876
his church's Rebecca Lee
Crumpler Free Clinic

06:38.920 --> 06:41.009
is in danger of shutting down.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.447
A redevelopment project
led by Vladislav Zlovac

06:44.491 --> 06:46.971
has bought all
the other buildings
on the block,

06:47.015 --> 06:48.973
and by acquiring
the Clinic facility,

06:49.017 --> 06:51.280
hopes to create
a multi-use complex

06:51.323 --> 06:54.152
that will be, according
to zoning applications,

06:54.196 --> 06:56.328
"The Crown Jewel of Freeland."

06:56.372 --> 06:59.723
The Clinic has less
than two weeks to find
a way to remain open.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.639
Our calls to Zlovac's office
for comment went unanswered.

07:02.683 --> 07:06.251
Man, these real estate guys
are no better
than drug dealers.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.427
[Jennifer] Mmm-hmm.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.518
These people are gonna die
without that Clinic.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.041
They won't get
preventative care.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.609
They won't get prenatal care.
They won't get diagnostic

07:15.652 --> 07:17.393
Whoa! You're dating Zoe B?

07:18.263 --> 07:19.961
[chuckling] Yo, that's crazy.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.528
You're gonna get
crushed though.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.573
She gonna love you one minute,
forget you the next.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.141
I can't believe you're
following my dating life
on social media.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.491
Okay, first of all,
ain't nobody following
your dating life,

07:28.535 --> 07:29.797
okay, it just popped up.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.712
And second, what else
do you expect me to do

07:31.755 --> 07:34.497
when the only freedom I have
is to walk around
the block for exercise?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.238
-[sighs]
-By the way,

07:36.281 --> 07:38.806
do you know what
Mom and Dad plan on
doing about my situation?

07:38.849 --> 07:40.634
No, but...

07:40.677 --> 07:43.637
I do hear your name a lot
in whispered conversations.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.856
Okay, so you hear my name,
but not what they're saying?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.945
Nothing about me going
back to school? Come on.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.818
I'm not about to hide
behind the couch
and listen to our parents.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.776
I would do the same thing
for you, Harriet.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.300
Just like I'm telling you
the truth about

07:55.344 --> 07:57.825
you needing to stop focusing
on this shiny object.

07:57.868 --> 07:58.956
You're wasting your time,
for real.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.567
I'm not wasting anything.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.612
Zoe was fine.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.006
And, besides,

08:05.049 --> 08:06.747
aren't you the one who told me
I need to get back out there?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.533
[crackling]

08:10.577 --> 08:12.753
-Ouch!
-[laughs]

08:12.796 --> 08:14.624
Jen, did you just
have an energy spike?

08:14.668 --> 08:15.712
No.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.105
I've been trying
to control my powers

08:17.148 --> 08:18.672
so Mom and Dad
will set me free.

08:18.715 --> 08:22.327
[sighs] There's one digit
that I almost feel good about.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.155
Anyway, I'm just saying

08:24.199 --> 08:25.766
you need to get into
a relationship that
actually means something.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.116
Not some
social media booty call,

08:28.159 --> 08:30.379
'cause in two or three years,
when you're old and wrinkly,

08:30.422 --> 08:32.468
-ain't nobody gonna be
looking at you anyway.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.166
Gonna be saving clinics
with only your super-suit
to keep you company.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.820
-Is that what you want?
[laughs]
-Oh!

08:36.864 --> 08:39.736
[laughing] So, really,
so you just zapped me
outta love?

08:39.780 --> 08:42.652
Yeah, and to wake your ass up.
Zoe B is a bad look for you.

08:42.696 --> 08:45.437
She's cotton candy,
and you need soul food.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.576
How about Coleman at Trinity
or Harrison at Stanford?

08:53.620 --> 08:56.013
You already asked them
and they said no.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.102
Yeah, but maybe
you could bring the weight
of the government to bear

08:58.146 --> 08:59.800
and convince them
to come on board.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.584
We prefer Dr. Jace.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.891
Why? She's insane,
Agent Odell.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.807
She's a leading
computational chemist
in the US

09:06.850 --> 09:11.594
and no one
has her experience in
protein synthesis simulations.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.596
If I'm gonna
save these children,

09:13.640 --> 09:16.033
I need great minds
that I don't need
to hide the knives from.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.949
You told me that
you needed more help.

09:18.993 --> 09:22.039
This is what I have to offer.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.390
It's hard not to see
this as you trying
to sabotage my efforts.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.698
If I was trying to do that,

09:28.742 --> 09:30.178
you'd have failed by now.

09:32.528 --> 09:35.705
Agent Odell,
when these kids die,
it's on your head.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.013
No, it's not, Dr. Stewart.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.755
Need I remind you
that you stole this job,

09:41.798 --> 09:45.715
so everything
after that is on you.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.848
You know, I'm gonna
set up a meeting...

09:49.153 --> 09:51.852
so that you can convince

09:52.853 --> 09:54.594
Dr. Jace to, uh,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.900
come on board.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.792

10:37.114 --> 10:39.029
[Principal Lowry] No, no,
we absolutely can do that

10:40.378 --> 10:41.379
Okay.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.208
Okay, no, that's perfect.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.471
Right. Okay, great.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.087
-I'm Jeffer--
-Mr. Pierce. Yes.

10:53.870 --> 10:54.871
Principal Lowry.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.222
Mr. Lowry...

10:59.397 --> 11:00.529
welcome to Garfield.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.750
[exhales] Yeah.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.101
-Would you like me
to show you around the school?
-No.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.886
But I did hear
about your meeting
with the students.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.714
Classy.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.848
Yeah, uh, I just wanna
make sure the transition
is easier for them.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.633
Right, well,
let's hope it worked.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.636
-Listen, Mr. Lowry--
-It's Principal Lowry.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.292
Yes, of course.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.903
The metal detectors,

11:26.947 --> 11:29.253
-is that really necessary?
-Obviously.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.952
Or you'd still have this job.

11:31.995 --> 11:35.869
Now, since I don't seem
to have an office just yet,
why don't we meet

11:35.912 --> 11:38.915
in the conference room
to go over a few things
in about an hour?

11:38.959 --> 11:40.438
-Sounds good.
-Good.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.707
[classic R&B music
playing on earphones]

12:07.204 --> 12:08.379
Are you all right?

12:08.902 --> 12:09.903
Can I help you?

12:11.034 --> 12:12.166
Aren't you sweet.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.822
I'm in the neighborhood
to meet with you, Jennifer.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.825
You just said my name.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.043
Did I?

12:21.784 --> 12:22.872
My name is Perenna.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.791
-[gasps]
-Hey, easy. Calm down.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.575
What the hell?
Where are we?

12:30.619 --> 12:31.838
-Sit down and--
-No!

12:31.881 --> 12:33.665
You're safe here.
I just wanna talk yo you--

12:33.709 --> 12:36.799
No, I don't wanna talk!
Take me back
to where we just came from!

12:36.843 --> 12:40.063
I'm serious!
Get me out of here, now!

12:40.107 --> 12:42.849
-Wow, it's not by the bottle.
-[laughing] The craft.
Was that correct?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.242
-[Jefferson] The craft--
-How could you two do that?

12:45.286 --> 12:47.244
Hmm? No warning, no choice,

12:47.288 --> 12:50.291
just sending some random woman
to track me down
on the street.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.989
It's not bad enough that
I'm trapped in this house,

12:53.033 --> 12:54.817
that I can't live my life,

12:54.861 --> 12:56.732
but now I don't even
deserve to know
what's happening to me?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.168
Of course you do,
Perenna just wanted--

12:58.212 --> 12:59.779
[shouts] Does it look like
I care what she wanted?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.215
Whoa! Young lady.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.651
Now watch how
you talk to your mother.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.305
[scoffs]

13:07.003 --> 13:08.918
What about what I want?

13:08.962 --> 13:12.095
How about how I feel?
Do you guys
ever think about that?

13:12.139 --> 13:13.575
[Jefferson] Je... Jen.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.272
Every moment.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
Perenna felt it was
important to meet you

13:16.970 --> 13:19.102
without there being
expectations on your part.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.843
Look, we're sorry
if you feel sandbagged--

13:20.887 --> 13:23.541
You don't understand,
I'm way past sandbagged!

13:23.585 --> 13:24.716
Sweetheart...

13:25.848 --> 13:27.415
we don't have any other ideas

13:27.458 --> 13:29.939
on how to help you
control your powers, and we...

13:29.983 --> 13:33.073
We don't want you to hurt
yourself or other people.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.161
Gambi just suggested Perenna

13:34.204 --> 13:36.032
because of her special skills.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.077
You think I'm a monster.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.948
-No! No!
-No, we don't.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.342
Baby girl, no.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.433
Look, I'm so sorry.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.048
It's my fault.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.964
Okay? All of it is my fault.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.576
If I could take it away,
I would.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.021
I'm sorry.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.856
This is not the life
I wanted for you.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.128
[siren whoops]

14:30.086 --> 14:31.566
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:34.699 --> 14:36.527
-Deputy Chief Henderson?
-Yes.

14:38.399 --> 14:41.402
-What's your name, son?
-Hicks. Roman Hicks, sir.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.187
This is my tenth day
on the job.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.102
[Inspector Henderson]
All right, what you got here?

14:46.146 --> 14:49.105
Well, there's
a scorched service weapon
under the front seat

14:49.149 --> 14:51.281
-and a--
-A crispy critter on it.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.109
Well, I wouldn't
have said that, but yes.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.418
This...

14:57.461 --> 14:59.507
This looks like
one of our unmarked cars.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.293
Does it belong
to Detective Summers?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.992
Well, the fire was hot enough
to melt most of the
serial numbers off the dash,

15:06.035 --> 15:08.820
but the five numbers
we can read match.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.474
Well...

15:12.215 --> 15:14.130
now we know
why he was missing.

15:14.174 --> 15:17.046
Medical examiner said
he'd have the dental ID
in a couple of hours.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.787
You see anything
like this at the academy?

15:20.963 --> 15:22.660
Well, that's
a professional torch job

15:22.704 --> 15:25.011
to hide evidence.
What does that tell you?

15:25.054 --> 15:28.318
That the killer didn't
wanna be tied to the scene.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.147
Which means this is a
next-level kind of criminal...

15:32.627 --> 15:35.804
and Detective Summers
was probably doing bad things.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.025
[machine humming]

15:41.418 --> 15:42.419
[door buzzes]

15:46.684 --> 15:47.947
[chain rattling]

16:02.570 --> 16:03.571
[Lynn] Dr. Jace?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.140
I'm Dr. Lynn Stewart.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.532
Did they tell you
why you were coming here?

16:09.185 --> 16:10.926
No.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.102
I'd like to include you
in a team working
to save the children

16:13.146 --> 16:16.018
who were the victims
of the vaccinations
and Green Light experiments.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.324
The pod kids.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.066
[Lynn] Yes.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.199
Do you know what I did?

16:24.374 --> 16:27.899
You had a theory
about infrared spectroscopy

16:27.943 --> 16:30.772
and its use in the treatment
of neuropathy.

16:30.815 --> 16:34.558
You conducted
an unauthorized experiment
on 11 patients,

16:34.602 --> 16:37.344
causing them
to lose their feet.

16:37.387 --> 16:41.087
Despite that terrible
lapse in judgment,

16:41.130 --> 16:43.393
I'm confident
you can contribute.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.829
So, what's in it for me?

16:44.873 --> 16:46.135
[scoffs]

16:46.179 --> 16:48.616
Wouldn't you rather
be doing science

16:48.659 --> 16:49.791
than sitting in a cell?

16:49.834 --> 16:52.924
I do science all the time,
Dr. Stewart.

16:52.968 --> 16:56.058
They took away my lab,
they didn't take away my mind.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.497
I understand officials
have denied you
visits to your son.

17:03.109 --> 17:07.200
If you help me,
I will try to
facilitate a visit.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.207
Ten.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.124
-Excuse me?
-Ten patients lost
their feet. One died.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.399
[Reverend Holt]
Melinda, is that you?

17:32.442 --> 17:33.704
I thought you were
going to choir rehearsal.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.141
[muffled voice]
Don't turn around.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.318
Whoever you are,

17:38.361 --> 17:41.103
this week's donation
has already been
taken to the bank.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.062
I'm not here
to take your money.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.150
I brought you money.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.285
[chuckling] Ah.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
Robin Hood. Listen, um...

17:53.463 --> 17:55.291
I never got a chance
to say thank you.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.033
You should use some
of that money to help
save the Crumpler Clinic.

17:58.077 --> 18:03.038
Your donation has already been
distributed to the lawyers
for the children in the pods.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.128
And though I'm very grateful,
it still isn't enough.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.565
How much do you need?

18:08.609 --> 18:11.307
If you could write a check,
you wouldn't be wearing
that mask.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.178
That wasn't my question.

18:14.963 --> 18:19.185
Well, we have the right of
first refusal on the building.

18:19.228 --> 18:22.840
Fair market value is
a little more than $300,000.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.018
Okay.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.194
Young lady...

18:31.110 --> 18:32.111
can I pray for you?

18:36.245 --> 18:41.250
Lord, we know that you move
in mysterious ways.

18:41.294 --> 18:44.427
So we just come
to you today asking you
to keep everyone safe,

18:44.471 --> 18:48.214
and asking you
to let your goodness flow

18:48.953 --> 18:51.086
into the dark places

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
for the benefit
of all of your children.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.134
[Anissa] Amen.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.136
Amen.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.924
[jazz music playing]

19:11.802 --> 19:12.977
Any issues?

19:14.936 --> 19:16.677
Rion didn't show.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.158
I found him at his house
with some chicken-head.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.769
He had it,
he just got distracted.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.772
That's what happens
when these Negros grow up
without their daddies.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.991
All they wanna do
is lay up between
a woman's legs

19:27.035 --> 19:30.038
and have another baby
they're not gonna
take care of.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.650
Your father ain't live
at home either, did he?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.524
No.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.352
-But my mom was--
-You need to check Rion

19:39.395 --> 19:41.876
so he understands
the importance of structure.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.095
Last week, he was late.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.359
This time,
you had to go find him.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.099
Next, he'll come up
short on the count.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.667
Nip it in the bud now.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.095
[R&B music playing]

21:21.889 --> 21:23.064
Hi, Grace.

21:28.678 --> 21:29.940
What do you want?

21:30.637 --> 21:31.681
I just wanna talk.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.901
I meant to drink.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.731
[sighs]

21:37.774 --> 21:40.386
Look, I'm sorry
you saw me at Zoe's.

21:40.429 --> 21:41.474
You mean caught you at Zoe's?

21:42.605 --> 21:45.391
No, that's not what I meant.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.611
I am sorry
that I dropped off
without a conversation,

21:48.655 --> 21:51.048
but you and I weren't
in a relationship.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.181
Doesn't mean I couldn't
have had better manners,

21:53.224 --> 21:55.270
but it also doesn't mean
I couldn't see other people.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.493
And I sure hope
you were seeing other people

22:00.536 --> 22:04.975
because you are
too damn fine to be lonely.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.197
Yeah, I was
seeing plenty of people.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.851
Not that it's
any of your business.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.464
No. No, none of
my business at all.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.339
Grace, I...

22:21.601 --> 22:25.605
I take my work
really, really seriously,

22:25.648 --> 22:28.172
but my sister pointed out
that it doesn't mean

22:28.216 --> 22:30.305
I can't take other things
seriously, too.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.310
I'd like to try.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.711
Hey.

22:45.494 --> 22:46.495
You wanna come in?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.889
This ain't a social call.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.380
[inhales deeply]
I got a murdered cop.

23:01.423 --> 23:04.600
Evidence destruction by fire.

23:04.644 --> 23:05.993
The torch job is professional.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.560
It takes tools and skills,

23:07.603 --> 23:09.257
and only three people
in Freeland could do it.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.476
Two of them
are currently in jail.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.567
-And the third?
-He won't talk to a cop.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.526
His livelihood depends on it.

23:20.834 --> 23:24.707
So, in my, uh, role as
former principal of Garfield,

23:24.751 --> 23:27.449
you want me to convince him
to come clean?

23:27.493 --> 23:30.496
I think Black Lightnin'
might be more persuasive.

23:30.539 --> 23:33.455
I texted you his info
and his mug shot.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.589
[stammers] Wait...
So you're cool with
the whole vigilante thing?

23:44.248 --> 23:46.599
-Former principal?
-[chuckles]

23:47.904 --> 23:49.776
I lost my job.

saved the school.

abandoned the school
and the students, so...

Good night.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.972
at some point,
we need to talk
this thing out, man.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.149
Yeah, at some point.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.938
Yo, Rion.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.680
Hey, has anybody seen Rion?

24:28.336 --> 24:31.121
I said, has anyone seen Rion?

24:31.165 --> 24:33.210
[Romel] Really, bro?

with bass in your voice.

about you, Romel.

...not too long ago,
your black ass
was in a wheelchair.

Before that...

24:54.318 --> 24:56.495
[scoffs] you were
runnin' track in hot pants.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.758
[all laughing]

24:58.801 --> 25:01.543
Now all of a sudden,
you a gangster
barking orders?

but Tobias' bitch.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.859
First of all,
I ain't nobody's bitch.

25:12.902 --> 25:16.166
And second,
the name's Painkiller.

25:16.689 --> 25:17.907

25:18.952 --> 25:20.040

25:20.083 --> 25:22.869
[Romel groans]

25:22.912 --> 25:25.480
Tobias don't like me
having to track you
down for his money.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.786
No, I paid you your money.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.570
-Why are you running?
-Ain't nobody running.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.006
-Don't make me chase you.
-[gasps]

25:35.708 --> 25:36.839
[body thuds]

26:00.733 --> 26:01.690
What made you
change your mind?

26:04.519 --> 26:07.740
Something my dad said.
[sighs]

26:07.783 --> 26:11.657
Look, can we please
just do this so that we can
both get on with our day?

26:15.269 --> 26:17.227
Where the hell are we?

26:17.271 --> 26:20.753
A place inside you that will
eventually allow you
to control your powers.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.320
Wait, a salon?

26:23.364 --> 26:25.409
Where is there any
safer space than this?

26:25.453 --> 26:28.369
Although some would argue
that this is a place

26:28.412 --> 26:31.590
that actually strips
black women of who
they naturally are.

26:31.633 --> 26:36.682
Uses hot combs, lye,
and all sorts of other alchemy
to hide our blackness.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.032
We turned it into something
completely different.

26:39.075 --> 26:42.905
For generations,
black women have
come here to talk, to share,

26:42.949 --> 26:46.953
to laugh, to cry,
to be safe from the world.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.172
[indistinct conversations]

26:52.175 --> 26:54.308
Black beauticians
have influenced politics

26:54.351 --> 26:56.266
and been foot soldiers
in the fight for freedom.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.226
Did you know that profits
from shops like this

26:59.269 --> 27:02.229
paid for buses to get people
to the march on Washington?

27:02.272 --> 27:04.666
-Great. Now you sound
like my sister.
-[laughs]

27:04.710 --> 27:08.539
Did you seriously
bring me here for a this-week-
in-black-history moment?

27:08.583 --> 27:10.977
[smacks lips] I've always
liked the beauty salon.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.503
I manifested this reality
since you're new to the work.

27:15.546 --> 27:18.854
But if you're not going
to use it, I can always
take us someplace else.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.640
I just want you
to be comfortable.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.687
I'm not comfortable.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.689
Okay? I really just wanna
go back to the real world.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.735
I know it's hard to believe,

27:29.778 --> 27:31.301
but you're doing
better than most.

27:32.607 --> 27:36.306
And here,
anything is possible.

27:36.350 --> 27:39.005
You know what
we're do gonna first?
We're gonna practice.

27:39.048 --> 27:41.572
We are going to build a box
to put your feelings in.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.663
What do you want it to be?

27:45.098 --> 27:46.186
Wood?

27:47.143 --> 27:48.144
Rock?

27:51.408 --> 27:52.453
Gold.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.194
[Perenna] Mmm.

27:55.499 --> 27:58.677
All right, let's begin.
[chuckles]

28:06.902 --> 28:08.208
How'd it go?

28:09.644 --> 28:11.820
Went to a beauty salon.
[sighs] Built a box.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.693
Uh, oh, okay.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.130
Good?

28:19.001 --> 28:19.828
Yeah.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.966
Most of the pods
are in this room,
but we have

28:27.009 --> 28:30.186
several other rooms where
we've isolated the children
with vulnerabilities.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.800
Is the anesthetizing agent
the same for all of them?

28:35.801 --> 28:37.628
Yes.

28:37.672 --> 28:40.457
And like the labs
we were just in,

28:40.501 --> 28:41.981
-make sure you don't
cross the line.
-[sensor beeps]

28:42.024 --> 28:43.722
-[electricity crackles]
-[Dr. Jace groans]

28:43.765 --> 28:45.898
-[alarm beeping]
-[Lynn sighs]

28:47.943 --> 28:48.814
[groans softly]

28:52.034 --> 28:53.209
It really works.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.385
[Lynn] Yes.

28:55.429 --> 28:58.649
If you go outside
the prescribed areas,

28:58.693 --> 29:01.217
that implant in your ankle
will disable you.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.786
If you try to
remove the implant,
it will disable you.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.834
And if you somehow
manage to get it out
and remain alert,

29:08.877 --> 29:13.012
the implant will
sound an alarm and
the guards will shoot you.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.230
[Dr. Jace sighs]

29:14.274 --> 29:16.102
I'm pretty sure allowing
guards to shoot me

29:16.145 --> 29:18.887
isn't part of
the Hippocratic Oath.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.889
Or don't you care
about that anymore?

29:22.848 --> 29:24.806
Let me be clear.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.983
You stay out of prison
as long as I say
you stay out of prison.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.465
The minute I think
you're a danger to me,
or anyone who works here,

29:31.508 --> 29:34.990
or these children,
I will have you thrown
into such a dark place,

29:35.034 --> 29:37.340
you'll wonder
if the sun still shines.
Do you understand?

29:37.384 --> 29:39.778
Yes. I understand.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.869
We're not gonna be friends.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.831
[Anissa] I couldn't find
a single thing

29:49.875 --> 29:53.400
Zlovac had been involved in
until this Freeland project.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.620
Who even lets
a real estate novice
spend a billion dollars?

29:56.664 --> 29:59.188
It's money laundering.
Plain and simple.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.973
There's no other
reasonable explanation.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.844
-The redevelopment project's
probably never gonna happen.
-[sighs]

30:05.151 --> 30:07.240
Where is the dirty money
coming from though?

30:07.283 --> 30:09.068
Who knows? Drugs, guns,

30:09.111 --> 30:12.985
it could be foreign dictators
stealing from widows
and orphans.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.378
The clinic is set
to be sold this week.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.903
Does Zlovac have
that much cash
in his bank accounts?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.516
[Gambi] Nope.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.126
So the money's not there yet.

30:27.564 --> 30:30.045
-What are you doing?
-I'm not telling you.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.830
You'll run off,
you'll tell my dad.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.092
Next thing I know,
he's trying to stop me--

30:33.135 --> 30:36.051
I am not gonna
tell your father.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.532
At least not before you do
what it is you're gonna do.

30:40.490 --> 30:41.491
Excellent.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.060
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
keep my mouth shut, though.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.976
If I see you doing
somethin' stupid,
I'm gonna tell you.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.892
I wouldn't expect
anything less, Uncle Gambi.

30:50.936 --> 30:51.937
I'll talk to you.

31:30.584 --> 31:31.585
Turn it off.

31:31.628 --> 31:32.891
What is wrong with you?

31:32.934 --> 31:34.196
Stop electrifying that.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.329
You first.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.166
[clangs]

31:48.167 --> 31:49.211
[groans]

31:50.473 --> 31:51.474
[groaning in pain]

31:52.998 --> 31:54.608
Car in the parking lot.

31:54.651 --> 31:57.089
Guy in the front seat.
Who hired you?

31:57.132 --> 31:58.612
Nope.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.440
-[groaning]
-[electricity crackling]

32:01.702 --> 32:05.880
That electric rope
is about 1,500 volts.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.187
I can generate
a hundred times that.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.016
You got a lot of
flammable things up in here.

32:11.059 --> 32:15.281
I can protect myself,
but, uh, what you gonna do?

32:15.324 --> 32:17.761
-Probably just die, right?
-[panting]

32:17.805 --> 32:19.589
-Who hired you?
-I... I don't know!

32:19.633 --> 32:21.113
This guy just snuck up

32:21.156 --> 32:22.462
behind me in the alley.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.637
Threw some money down.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.812
He told me
he was gonna kill me

32:24.855 --> 32:26.205
if I didn't do the job
in the next hour.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.728
What'd he look like?

32:27.771 --> 32:30.861
All I saw were these weird
gladiator things on his arms.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.217
I suggest you find
another line of work.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.435
[groans]

32:44.875 --> 32:47.443
[Inspector Henderson] Tobias
killed Detective Summers?

32:47.487 --> 32:49.184
[Black Lightning]
Gladiator arms.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.752
It sounds like Painkiller,
but that kid
is just a sidekick.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.973
At least we know that
he's still in Freeland
after the school attack.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.975
Well, I already knew that.

32:57.018 --> 33:00.239
A One Hundred member
got darted and fell off
the balcony, broke his neck.

33:00.282 --> 33:02.023
Okay, were you able
to get anything from him

33:02.067 --> 33:04.243
that would lead us
to Painkiller or Tobias?

33:04.286 --> 33:06.680
Well, surprisingly,
between the long fall

33:06.723 --> 33:09.596
and the general lack of life,
he wasn't very chatty.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.380
Why would Tobias
kill your detective?

33:11.424 --> 33:14.427
I don't know, but he isn't
a guy who really needs
a reason, right?

33:14.470 --> 33:16.385
What... No.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.388
No, he's worked really hard
to stay out of the spotlight
for 30 years.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.129
Why antagonize you now?

33:21.173 --> 33:23.218
Look, I don't know.
Maybe he just didn't
wanna be different

33:23.262 --> 33:25.003
than every other
gangster in Freeland.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.013
Good morning, Ms. Payne.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.278
I know why you're here.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.063
I've talked to the police.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.283
I'll tell you, too.
I don't know where he is.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.676
Now I know that's not true.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.417
Maybe he didn't
come home right away.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.290
Too excited about
being back on his feet.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.336
But I saw the news reports
when he was injured.
You were right there.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.339
That young man loves you.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.081
So I know he came to see you,
if only to give you money.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.214
Even so, I've got
nothin' to say to you.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.433
I know you wanna save him
from the trouble he's in.

34:04.477 --> 34:08.655
It's too late. That boy
got himself into something.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.091
There's no way out.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.920
That's what he thinks,
and that's what he told you.

34:12.963 --> 34:15.183
But it's not true.

34:15.227 --> 34:18.317
As long as Khalil's alive,
there's hope.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.493
But the clock is ticking.

34:20.536 --> 34:24.149
He's not stronger or smarter
than the people
he's in business with.

34:24.192 --> 34:25.411
He give you a burner phone?

34:25.454 --> 34:27.674
A number so you can reach him,

34:27.717 --> 34:30.459
like any good son would.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.595
You want him to live,

34:36.335 --> 34:38.250
you need to call him

34:38.293 --> 34:40.208
and tell him to meet with me.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.747
How do I look?

35:00.663 --> 35:01.664
Good.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.279
[safe lock clicks, beeps]

35:08.845 --> 35:11.283
-Then let's go.
-[cell phone vibrates]

35:25.732 --> 35:28.604
Look, I only came here
to tell you to stay away
from my mother.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.345
She just wants to help you.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.738
If you wanna help her,

35:31.781 --> 35:34.088
then you don't tell her
her son's going to die.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.569
You know you're
no match for Tobias.

35:36.612 --> 35:39.485
Just tell me how to find him,
and I'll take him out for you.

35:39.528 --> 35:42.531
Right. And when you fail,
then I will die.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.839
I won't let that happen.

35:45.882 --> 35:50.757
If that Thunder chick
never showed up, he would've
beat your ass at the school.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.282
Yeah, you're not that much
of a match for Tobias either.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.675
You're better
than this, Khalil.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.504
-My name is Painkiller.
-No.

35:58.547 --> 36:02.551
You had a life before,
people who loved you.

36:02.595 --> 36:05.250
Even in that wheelchair,
it was better than this.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.558
You stay away.

36:09.602 --> 36:11.125
Or I'll make it
my life's mission

36:11.169 --> 36:12.953
to track down
all the people you love

36:12.996 --> 36:15.390
and kill them
just like I killed you.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.479
-[Black Lightning grunting]
-[groaning]

36:18.306 --> 36:20.047
Where's Tobias?

36:20.090 --> 36:22.136
You little bitch!

36:22.180 --> 36:23.355
[groans]

36:27.054 --> 36:29.317
-[weapon whirs]
-[electricity crackling]

37:16.451 --> 37:18.497
[guns cocking]

37:21.326 --> 37:23.371
[Inspector Henderson]
Both hands where I can
see 'em, Whale.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.247
[officer] Turn around now.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.469
You know,
I almost didn't believe

37:34.513 --> 37:36.341
somebody dropped
a dime on you.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.692
But today is my lucky day.

37:39.735 --> 37:43.261
Tobias Whale,
you are under arrest for
the murder of Alvin Pierce.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.219
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.570
Anything you say can
and will be held against you
in a court of law.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.093
You have a right
to an attorney.

37:50.137 --> 37:52.357
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.662
[SWAT member] Let's go.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.369
I know I helped you
figure out this meeting
was taking place.

38:04.412 --> 38:05.892
That doesn't mean I think
it's a good idea for you

38:05.935 --> 38:08.111
-to go down there.
-I'll be fine.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.461
Why do they
all have ponytails?

38:09.504 --> 38:10.636
[Gambi] Shit, I don't know.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.246
These aren't your
ordinary street thugs.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.509
They're not gonna
take this lightly.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
is this the money?

38:16.381 --> 38:18.470
Probably.

38:18.513 --> 38:21.342
-Anissa--
-Uncle Gambi, the clinic
is running out of time.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.258
If I don't help, then I'll
just be wasting the gifts
that God gave me.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.520
That's what your father
always used to say.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.181
[Gambi] I got you.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.415
[men groaning]

39:13.655 --> 39:14.961
[groans]

39:34.850 --> 39:36.591
God bless you, sister...

39:38.506 --> 39:39.986
whatever the hell
your name is.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.242
So, I changed my mind.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.506
I want my containment box
to be made of diamonds.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.465
[chuckles] Well, they are
a girl's best friend,

40:24.509 --> 40:26.598
but, uh, we're not
doing that today

40:26.641 --> 40:29.296
But I thought I was
building a box and stuff
all my feelings inside,

40:29.339 --> 40:31.646
so I could
get on with my life.

40:31.690 --> 40:36.695
We are. But before
you can stuff your
feelings into anything,

40:36.738 --> 40:39.524
we need to know
what those feelings are.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.837
[screaming]

40:59.674 --> 41:00.893
[knock on door]

41:08.509 --> 41:11.120
-[Jefferson] Hey.
-I wanted you
to hear it from me.

41:13.514 --> 41:14.646
We caught him.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.126
We caught Tobias.
