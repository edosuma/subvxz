WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.925
I've been tortured by the Devil himself.
What can you do to me?

00:08.039 --> 00:09.041
SAM: <i>She's British. Men of Letters.</i>

00:09.200 --> 00:10.361
Aren't we supposed to be on the same team?

00:10.520 --> 00:12.807
Did you know
it's possible to die from pain?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.844
Get away from my boys.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.001
- Mom?
- Yeah.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.360
SAM: <i>Mom? A Hunter?</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:21.284
DEAN: <i>You were good at this, weren't you?</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:22.441
MARY: <i>Very.</i>

00:22.640 --> 00:24.324
<i>Hunters, no matter how good they are,</i>

00:24.480 --> 00:25.766
they all end up the same way.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.290
I never wanted this for you, and Sam.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.885
So the kid had ectoplasm
leaking out of his ear?

00:30.040 --> 00:32.202
SAM: <i>It's gotta be ghost possession.</i>

00:32.360 --> 00:35.125
<i>They get angry enough, they can
take control of the person's body.</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:38.090
Vince, together we can
heal your sister, Wendy.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.004
You gotta put Lucifer back in the cage.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.681
<i>You're the only one that can do this.</i>

00:46.000 --> 00:47.001
Seriously?

00:47.160 --> 00:49.083
MARY: <i>I've heard of people
coming back from the dead before.</i>

00:49.240 --> 00:51.527
But actually do it, after 30 years?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.444
<i>I just have a lot of blanks to fill in.</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:56.649
For me, having you here,
fills in the biggest blank.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.402
"Played out"? You're kidding?
That place was great.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.927
Another avocado toast? Please.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.847
Yeah, but avocado toast with quail egg?
Genius.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.043
- How many stars you giving them?
- Two.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.326
Four.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.687
You realize our ratings
just gonna cancel each other out.

01:24.320 --> 01:26.004
NATALIA: Should've bought here
when we had the chance.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.606
I mean, new restos, new stores...

01:28.760 --> 01:29.761
New prices.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.129
Neighborhood's been picked clean
by flippers and condo developers.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.527
Did you hear that?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.204
Yeah, it came from that house over there.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.931
Yeah, but who'd wanna live in there?

01:44.840 --> 01:46.365
Squatters or crackheads.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.760
With a baby?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.281
Call 911.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.441
- What?
- Do it.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.647
Okay, Okay.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.206
WOMAN: <i>Nine-one-one.
What's your emergency?</i>

01:55.360 --> 01:58.523
Hi, there's a baby in distress
in an abandoned house at...

02:00.680 --> 02:02.489
Nat!

02:07.840 --> 02:08.920
Hello?

03:04.480 --> 03:05.766
What?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.124
Something touched my arm.
I mean, something...

03:11.280 --> 03:12.520
- We have to get out of here now.
- Okay.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.288
Castiel, what are you doing up?

03:57.440 --> 04:00.762
Well, I'm always up.
Angels don't need sleep.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.125
Wish I had that problem.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.883
Anyway. I think I'll go try again.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.681
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.081
Castiel?

04:21.760 --> 04:25.082
After you left Heaven,
when did it start to feel like...

04:27.000 --> 04:29.287
Like you fit? Like you

04:30.720 --> 04:31.721
belonged here?

04:32.400 --> 04:33.970
Well, I'm still not sure I do.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.041
Yeah.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.847
Mary.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.009
You do belong here.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.927
Goodnight, Castiel.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.484
All right, so what have you found
on Her Majesty's secret suck bags?

05:28.680 --> 05:30.205
Well, I mean,
I turned the bunker upside down

05:30.360 --> 05:33.091
looking for any reference
whatsoever to the British Men of Letters.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.165
And all I found was this letter
tucked into an old ledger

05:38.520 --> 05:40.682
from the London chapterhouse.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.530
Okay, well, that's something.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.729
Yeah, uh, not so much.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.441
Awesome.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.767
Morning, sunshine. Want some coffee?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.763
No. Thank you. I have to go.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.646
- SAM: Cass?
- Cass, wait up.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.764
Hey. Wait a second. Where you off to?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.491
- Cleveland, Ohio.
- For what?

06:08.680 --> 06:10.489
I think I may have a lead on Lucifer.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.409
I found a police report in Cleveland,

06:12.600 --> 06:15.285
about a man whose
eyes flared a glowing red.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.170
It could be Lucifer in a new body.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.485
All right, yeah,
that sounds like something.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.051
- We should check it out.
- No.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.090
The Devil is free because of me,
finding him is my responsibility.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.601
But, Cass, you're gonna
want some backup on this.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.848
If it is him, I will call you.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.164
In the meantime,
I think you're needed here.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.530
- What the hell was that about?
- Mom.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.170
What you talking about? Mom's fine.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.406
You sure?

06:46.560 --> 06:48.927
I heard her walking
around all night last night.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.930
I mean, don't you think
she seems a bit withdrawn,

06:52.080 --> 06:54.686
- you know? Shaky?
- Of course, she's shaky.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.608
She hasn't been on this planet
since Jane Fonda was wearing legwarmers.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.683
All she needs a little R&R, you know?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.366
Some good family time,
she'll be aces.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.807
Yeah.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.327
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.090
- Hey, morning.
- Hey.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.846
- Ooh.
- We can fry up some more.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.843
That's probably cold by now, Mom.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.001
It's bacon.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.850
Wow, we are so related.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.086
Did you cut your hair?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.042
I'm gonna keep it short
if I'm gonna go out on a hunt, you know.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.249
Why give the bad guys the advantage
of long, pull-able hair, right?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.401
DEAN: Wow.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.728
I'm trying to tell Sam that for years.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.049
Did you say, uh, "Going out on a hunt?"

07:40.040 --> 07:41.041
I found a case.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.851
I thought you were still struggling
with even the idea of the Internet?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.408
I had Dean pick up some newspapers
when he went into town.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.046
Whoa, whoa, I...

07:49.440 --> 07:51.090
You didn't tell me
you were looking for a case.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.327
I wasn't.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.690
I just found one.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.923
Minnesota. Two dead, locked room.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.331
Victims had put in a call about
a crying baby, but the place was empty.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.410
The only thing at the scene
was their bodies.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.962
Been five days, and the coroner
still hasn't put out a cause of death.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.561
Seemed fishy.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.161
It's probably nothing,

08:16.320 --> 08:19.847
I just thought I might get out there,
stretch my legs.

08:21.240 --> 08:25.086
But I thought, you weren't
down to hunt in the first place.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.651
Well, things change, right?

08:29.880 --> 08:30.927
Family hunting trip.

08:36.440 --> 08:37.486
Sure.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.409
All right. Meet in the car in 10.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.766
What about the R&R?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.441
Well...

08:50.160 --> 08:52.083
Look, man,
Cass healed your s'mores foot, all right?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.846
I got Baby back to mint, we're road ready.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.083
And if Mom wants to hunt, I say we hunt.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.801
You're gonna...

09:11.320 --> 09:12.321
Nice bike.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.049
So lot of things have gone
to seed since you were here,

09:29.200 --> 09:33.171
but the variety in snack food flavors,
is not one of them.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.285
We got you Teriyaki jerky,
we got your Sriracha,

09:36.440 --> 09:40.764
and we got your chili lime,
which is my personal favorite.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.801
Let's give chili lime a whirl.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.801
Huh?

09:52.400 --> 09:54.004
It's good.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.649
Artificial, kind of tingly.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.526
That's how you know it's working.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.121
Hey.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.407
Look,

10:25.440 --> 10:26.930
I been around
all stripes of Vince, all right?

10:27.080 --> 10:29.526
Drunk Vince,
depressed Vince, megalomaniacal,

10:29.680 --> 10:30.727
"I'm a Golden God" Vince.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.609
The Vince who
threw me through that door,

10:34.560 --> 10:35.561
that wasn't him.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.883
And it wasn't just his eyes, man.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.244
I mean, his strength, he was,

10:42.400 --> 10:45.563
like an MMA fighter.
Hell, he was like 20.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.403
Okay, now, if you
hear from him, don't hesitate to call.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.404
Okay, Agent BeyoncÃ©?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.687
I guess that makes me, Agent Jay-Z.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.600
Agent Shirley Partridge,
out of the Minneapolis field office.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.764
These are my partners,
Agent Cassidy and Agent Bonaduce.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.251
This is a local case,

11:22.400 --> 11:23.765
- why would the FBI be...
- They're new.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.763
Wanted their first case
to have training wheels.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.726
We wanted to have a look at the bodies.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.609
Now, you haven't filed a report.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.286
Has there been any problem
determining the cause of death?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.923
Problem? No. No, no, no.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.323
I figured out the cause.
Just doesn't make any damn sense.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.766
Is this a burn?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.289
Frostbite. Yeah.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.842
Both victims died of acute hypothermia

11:49.040 --> 11:50.724
in a 65-degree room.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.127
When I opened them up,
their hearts were literally,

11:55.280 --> 11:57.806
and I mean, literally, frozen.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.444
Wanna tell me how to
present that to the public?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.801
Or to their families?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.446
So much for training wheels, huh?

12:08.240 --> 12:11.164
Bumping into each other,
working the same leads.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.800
What are the odds, Cassie?
Fate brought us together.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.650
- Not interested.
- Why not?

12:15.800 --> 12:18.565
We made a somewhat
effective team against Amara.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.964
It's been months, I mean, months
since we last tried to kill each other.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.488
We both got very, very
good reasons to want Lucifer dead.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.161
Besides...

12:36.920 --> 12:40.447
While you were gabbing
with Vince's second fiddle,

12:40.600 --> 12:42.045
I was ransacking his room.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.721
Found these.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.480
Postcards from his beloved sister, Wendy.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.246
Oh, looky here,
an address and everything.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.801
Worth a look.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.370
DEAN: You sure you got
the swing of that thing?

13:11.560 --> 13:12.721
MARY: For the third time, yes.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.290
Dean, it's analog. I'm good.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.007
Right.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.047
SAM: <i>Mom! Got something over here.</i>

14:29.120 --> 14:31.122
- MARY: <i>Sam!</i>
- Mom!

14:31.480 --> 14:32.527
MARY: <i>Dean!</i>

14:33.960 --> 14:34.961
DEAN: <i>Mom!</i>

14:35.880 --> 14:38.326
- Mom?
- Sam! Dean!

14:47.240 --> 14:48.605
Hold on, Mom, we're coming.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.808
Mom, get away from the door.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.844
Mom, you're hurt.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.690
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

15:29.320 --> 15:33.370
Okay, ready to head out?
Go knock on some doors?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.646
- Doors?
- Yeah.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.370
Talk to the neighbors.
Hit up the hall of records, work

15:40.640 --> 15:41.641
the case.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.842
- We still do that, right?
- Sometimes.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.526
But the Internet has
made a lot of that legwork...

15:51.320 --> 15:52.321
Obsolete.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.650
I mean, I'm already in the Saint Paul
Police Department database.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.363
- Anything?
- Yeah, a lot.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.723
I've got police reports filed from 2004,

16:02.880 --> 16:05.690
uh, '91, '89, '85,

16:06.760 --> 16:10.321
'78. All deaths, all kids.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.886
Looks like it started with
this girl here. Elizabeth Moriarty.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.526
- You got all of that from that. It's...
- Yeah.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.521
Mom.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.561
Don't worry about it.
We'll teach you how to do this.

16:55.960 --> 16:56.961
Hello.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.121
I'm Agent BeyoncÃ©, and this is my, um...

17:00.880 --> 17:02.769
My partner, Agent Z.

17:04.520 --> 17:10.128
Um, we wanted to ask you a few questions
about your brother.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.281
Do you think that happens to Sam and Dean?

17:15.359 --> 17:17.089
Oh, all the time.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.404
Vinny, please call me.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.079
I got two Federal agents asking for you.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.050
Don't know what was with you yesterday,
but you're in trouble.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.770
How right you are, Wendy.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.407
So...

17:35.480 --> 17:38.609
Vince was here, yesterday.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.367
Odd.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.489
She's been recently healed.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.407
CROWLEY: Is that so?

17:49.520 --> 17:52.444
Let me guess, your brother
got you up and walking again.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.527
And how are you
enjoying the use of those legs?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.891
You know, the gift he gave you,
I can take away like...

18:06.600 --> 18:07.965
The thing that healed you?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.521
That wasn't your brother. Something...

18:12.360 --> 18:14.522
Something else. Something old and evil.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.126
I think a part of you knows that.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.009
We don't want to hurt Vince.
We wanna help him.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.329
He showed up out of the blue.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.688
And he fixed me like a miracle.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.081
But he did it cold,
like it was nothing to him,

18:38.640 --> 18:41.086
like he was running an errand.
Barely said a word.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.084
And then he just took off,
with his groupie friend.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.007
His "groupie friend"?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.920
Red-headed broad. Didn't say much.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.409
So, Vince's cabin in Sagamore Hills.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.408
Apparently, all of his
greatest records were written there.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.321
<i>Serpentine, Theater of Mercy...</i>

19:05.480 --> 19:07.562
I should have known there was
something you weren't telling me.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.121
Rowena?

19:10.320 --> 19:12.322
So Mother and I had an unfortunate,

19:12.480 --> 19:14.687
if not, rather
embarrassing run-in with Lucifer.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.929
You're just mad because
you're only my second choice

19:18.080 --> 19:19.525
for a Lucifer-hunt team-up.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.650
No, actually, I think it's sweet.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.122
I thought your motivation
was ambition and revenge.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.121
But now I know
you just wanna save your mother.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.091
It's not about saving her.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.526
Lucifer has made off with a colossally
powerful witch, who, by the way,

19:35.680 --> 19:39.366
is the only person alive who can
slam him back in the Cage.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.524
He will either kill her or control her.

19:44.480 --> 19:48.280
Or she'll offer her services
to the biggest bad in town

19:48.440 --> 19:51.364
in order to save her neck.
Like she always does.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.602
Do any of those sound like
particularly good outcomes to you?

19:58.960 --> 20:02.282
You got any beauty spells locked up
within that witchy brain of yours?

20:04.720 --> 20:05.721
Huh?

20:07.280 --> 20:11.001
I thought this one would last a bit longer
before going all Keith Richards on me.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.169
This vessel hopping is getting old.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.370
Just as I get used to limitations
of one meat sack, I gotta

20:23.080 --> 20:25.208
cut bait and jump
to the next flawed lump.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.481
Then you want me to
make this vessel permanent?

20:28.800 --> 20:30.165
Strong enough to hold you?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.171
It does look good on me.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.248
So, what you got, Red?

20:44.240 --> 20:47.483
I'd help, I would but
I don't have <i>The Book of the Damned.</i>

20:47.880 --> 20:48.881
I lost it.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.841
You know damned well where you put it.
Did you see what I did there?

20:54.520 --> 20:55.521
"Damned?"

20:57.360 --> 20:59.647
Besides, you don't need the book.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.845
Clever girl like you

21:04.240 --> 21:07.483
must have it all up here by now.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.528
- And if I refuse?
- I snap your neck, again.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.525
Only this time,
I'll rip your head clean off afterwards.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.687
Hmm?

21:26.040 --> 21:27.246
"Mylings?"

21:27.400 --> 21:30.529
Yeah, from Scandinavian lore.
Children spirits, vengeful ones.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.883
"Their cries to help
lure adults to their death."

21:34.160 --> 21:36.731
- Anything about frozen hearts?
- Uh, no.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.451
Not yet, but this is just from old,
incomplete folk accounts.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.682
We all know the lore
isn't always 100%.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.405
- DEAN: Hmm.
- Hmm.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.571
Maybe, but...

21:46.000 --> 21:49.288
All I know is,
that little boy who grabbed me?

21:51.200 --> 21:53.851
He didn't want to hurt me. He was scared.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.001
Yeah. Um...

22:02.200 --> 22:03.725
That must have felt that way, but,

22:03.920 --> 22:08.482
Mom, the victims were all
lured to their death by a baby's cry.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.850
Um, the spirit marked Natalia
right before she was killed.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.650
The same way the spirit marked you.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.926
I mean,
if we hadn't gotten there in time...

22:19.920 --> 22:21.490
Look, we know all the kids' names, right?

22:21.640 --> 22:24.450
We know that they're all buried locally,
so I say we salt and burn 'em,

22:24.600 --> 22:26.090
that's a safe bet.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.441
- Agreed.
- DEAN: All right.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.887
Let's do that.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.727
MARY: <i>Sammy.</i>

22:35.040 --> 22:36.485
Help me.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.608
Mom? Hey, hey.

22:39.760 --> 22:40.807
- Mom?
- You okay?

22:44.680 --> 22:45.761
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.722
I'm fine. I'll be fine.
I'm fine.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.363
Maybe, uh, you should stay here.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.281
Here.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.485
- Call if you need us.
- Okay.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.608
- All right?
- Back soon.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.330
MAN: <i>Ramsey County Register of Deeds.</i>

23:32.480 --> 23:34.687
Hello, I'm looking for contact information

23:34.840 --> 23:38.242
for the last owner of
1781 Chamberlin Street, please.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.086
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

23:40.280 --> 23:42.601
<i>Can't you just use
the Web site like everyone else?</i>

23:43.000 --> 23:44.365
I'm not everyone else.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.008
Please and thank you.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.363
CHERYL: <i>Lucas was so cold.</i>

23:56.440 --> 23:58.522
I still didn't understand what happened.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.366
I'd checked on him
just a minute before I found him.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.930
<i>How'd he get so cold so fast?</i>

24:06.440 --> 24:08.329
Gosh,
sorry for going on like this.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.211
MARY: <i>Don't apologize.</i>

24:11.280 --> 24:15.683
- What did Lucas look like?
- <i>Oh, he was so handsome.</i>

24:16.080 --> 24:19.368
<i>Blonde hair and these crystal blue eyes.</i>

24:19.560 --> 24:20.561
Anything else?

24:21.640 --> 24:22.971
<i>He had a scar on his cheek.</i>

24:25.920 --> 24:27.206
<i>From the neighbors' dog.</i>

24:28.200 --> 24:29.326
Thank you, Cheryl.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.688
I'm sorry for dredging all this up again.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.726
<i>Ah, it's okay.</i>

24:35.880 --> 24:37.405
<i>Actually, it's kind of nice.</i>

24:37.840 --> 24:39.763
No one talks on
the phone anymore, you know?

24:41.680 --> 24:45.526
I've noticed. Thank you, again.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.762
- Grim work.
- Yeah.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.449
You know, I'm worried about Mom.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.967
Why?

25:20.640 --> 25:21.687
You're not?

25:22.720 --> 25:24.165
She's back.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.765
I mean, yeah,
she's still working out the kinks,

25:25.960 --> 25:27.530
<i>we're all still
working out the kinks but,</i>

25:28.280 --> 25:31.250
I mean, can we, for once, just
not turn everything into a problem?

25:31.400 --> 25:34.370
You know, can we for once,
just have one good thing?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.610
- Mom's not a thing.
- Okay.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.929
Look, I'm happy too, Dean. I am.
I'm overjoyed.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.247
But there's something about her, I mean,
something's going on with her.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.006
- Yeah, she's adjusting.
- No, she's struggling.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.810
I mean, she's trying to bury
herself in hunting to avoid dealing.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.850
- And how do you know that?
- Years of personal experience.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.811
<i>I don't know, man, uh,</i>

25:59.760 --> 26:00.966
like mother, like sons.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.327
Mom?

26:32.120 --> 26:33.167
Weapons bag is missing.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.961
Lucas?

27:12.400 --> 27:13.731
That's your name, isn't it?

27:34.320 --> 27:38.882
I talked to your mommy,
she misses you so much.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.685
<i>Lucas, why did you bring me here?</i>

28:36.040 --> 28:38.964
Help us.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.566
- Hello?
- Mom, where are you?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.480
I'm at the Chamberlin house.
On a hunch.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.642
Yeah, we salted
and burned all the remains.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.811
Yeah. Didn't work.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.123
SAM: <i>Okay, get out of
the house and wait for us.</i>

29:02.400 --> 29:04.129
- MARY: <i>What? Hello?</i>
- Mom?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.607
<i>Hello?</i>

29:06.120 --> 29:07.167
Mom?

29:08.680 --> 29:09.681
Let's go.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.683
Ash of the hawthorn tree.

29:16.760 --> 29:19.081
- The pattern?
- A druidic glyph.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.121
I'm using a hybrid spell of my own devise.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.527
<i>Book of the Damned</i> and Celtic magic.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.003
Should give your vessel the resiliency
and strength of the mightiest tree.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.681
Oh.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.808
There's a woody joke
in there somewhere.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.881
Let's get back to that
nagging little word "should."

29:43.080 --> 29:44.730
It's uncharted territory,

29:44.880 --> 29:46.882
I can't promise
the spell will last forever.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.769
There's no known magic for that.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.725
But it will last.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.600
The final step.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.568
Permission to speak, Dark Lord?

30:22.480 --> 30:28.169
If when the spell succeeds,
and you're restored to your full glory...

30:29.360 --> 30:30.646
Will I just kill you?

30:33.240 --> 30:35.402
I can be of value beyond this spell.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.087
We'll see.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.247
Thank you, my Liege.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.681
Red, what did you do?

31:07.880 --> 31:10.451
Sped up the decaying process, my lord.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.648
<i>You thought
Keith Richards was bad?</i>

31:13.120 --> 31:14.451
Try Iggy Pop.

31:14.640 --> 31:20.090
Oh, decapitation is
far too merciful for you, ginger bitch!

31:22.200 --> 31:23.725
No!

31:26.520 --> 31:28.966
- You can't destroy me!
- Not yet.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.251
But I can send you far, far away.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.688
Try finding a new vessel
at the bottom of the bloody ocean.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.841
What's keeping you here?

31:44.480 --> 31:45.561
Him.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.531
You're the father of that little girl.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.049
You killed them all. All those...

32:37.320 --> 32:38.367
DEAN: <i>Mom!</i>

32:41.720 --> 32:42.721
Mom?

32:43.200 --> 32:44.247
Hey.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.847
Come on.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.607
Dean,

32:56.960 --> 32:57.961
she's possessed.

33:16.760 --> 33:17.921
My house.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.930
My children. Forever.

33:26.680 --> 33:30.162
Mom, you can fight this.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.441
Mom?

33:49.960 --> 33:52.361
The basement. Go!

34:10.800 --> 34:12.882
- Mom?
- Mommy's gone.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.408
Don't. Don't make me.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.842
I got you, Mom.

36:17.600 --> 36:20.649
If you're looking for Lucifer,
you just missed him.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.007
Cup of tea?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.843
Until you forced me
to get back in the game,

36:33.040 --> 36:34.644
I'd tried to forget about Lucifer.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.281
I loathe him.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.767
And I loathe, I had any part in
letting him out of the pit he belongs in.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.567
- So, you'll help us then?
- Good God, no.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.842
That whole FBI pantsuit look?

36:48.320 --> 36:49.651
Not my hex bag.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.486
But, if you get Lucifer cornered,
and find yourself in need.

36:55.800 --> 36:56.801
I'm there.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.240
Well, you gonna
take a shower or take a nap?

37:06.400 --> 37:07.811
I mean, you really went through it today.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.246
MARY: <i>No, I'm okay.</i>

37:09.400 --> 37:12.927
And, um, listen, apologies

37:14.000 --> 37:17.004
if, uh, me and Sam hijacked
or sidelined you in any way.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.324
I mean, this was your case,
you know and...

37:21.480 --> 37:24.848
- Well, you kicked ass. Again.
- I "kicked ass?"

37:27.320 --> 37:30.164
- You saved me. I...
- Yeah, but you were right.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.126
You know, those kids were innocent.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.611
I mean, hell, we didn't even know
what Moriarty's deal was.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.361
I do.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.003
When he possessed me, I saw...

37:46.320 --> 37:47.481
I felt it.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.641
All of it.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.401
When Hugo lost his child, he went mad.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.247
Buried himself alive in his basement

38:00.400 --> 38:02.641
and walled himself in
and starved to death.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.527
Damn.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.402
But when new families moved in,
families with children,

38:09.960 --> 38:13.043
he coveted those children.
So he took them.

38:13.880 --> 38:14.881
<i>Killed them.</i>

38:16.840 --> 38:19.002
And somehow that
bound their spirits to his.

38:19.560 --> 38:20.641
That's where he got his power.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.280
He was so greedy.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.567
Twisted.

38:33.400 --> 38:36.404
Mom, it's okay. All right?
You're home now.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.921
No.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.721
I'm not.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.601
I miss John.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.686
I miss my boys.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.726
We're right here, Mom.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.600
I know. In my head.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.321
But I'm still mourning them.
As I knew them.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.041
My baby Sam.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.121
My little boy Dean.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.321
<i>It just feels like yesterday,</i>

39:26.360 --> 39:28.488
we were together in Heaven. And now...

39:29.480 --> 39:32.529
I'm here and John is gone,

39:33.640 --> 39:34.880
<i>and they're gone.</i>

39:36.040 --> 39:38.281
And every moment
I spend with you reminds me

39:39.400 --> 39:41.129
of every moment I lost with them.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.964
And I thought hunting, working,
would clear my head...

40:00.160 --> 40:01.161
Mom.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.645
What are you trying to say?

40:08.320 --> 40:09.321
I have to go.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.521
I'm sorry.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.881
I'm so,

40:25.120 --> 40:26.121
<i>so sorry.</i>

40:30.360 --> 40:31.486
I just need a little time.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.681
I love you.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.327
I love you both.
