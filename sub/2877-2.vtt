WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:16.598
Uh, okay, Ross.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.436
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but, uh...

00:20.603 --> 00:24.148
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

00:24.524 --> 00:25.649
Rach, he just saw us.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.444
Shh.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.824
Uh, but what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.661
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.957
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

00:42.167 --> 00:44.960
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that happened...

00:45.128 --> 00:47.004
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

00:47.172 --> 00:51.467
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

00:53.053 --> 00:57.765
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.393
- But...
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.813
Yeah. But it did happen.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.815
So...

01:11.571 --> 01:22.706
Ross?

01:26.169 --> 01:28.962
Can we just close the door?

02:07.293 --> 02:09.086
Ross, say something.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.753
Anything.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.383
So you two are?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.969
Yeah.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.139
And have you had?

02:20.348 --> 02:23.350
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.853
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you?

02:26.062 --> 02:27.980
Probably...
No. No.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.318
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.445
You have every right
to go nuts.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.865
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.992
No, but you know what I mean.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.201
Hey, hey, hey.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.999
If you two are happy...

02:47.167 --> 02:50.377
...then I'm happy for you.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.380
I'm fine.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.842
- Really?
- Absolutely.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.386
I'm fine.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.305
Totally fine.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.933
Heh. I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

03:05.101 --> 03:06.143
...because, really...

03:06.311 --> 03:08.395
...I'm fine.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.650
I'm not saying
I wasn't a little surprised...

03:13.818 --> 03:16.695
...heh, to see you guys kissing.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.322
I mean, at first I was like:

03:21.868 --> 03:25.996
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

03:27.332 --> 03:28.916
Loving this.

03:31.085 --> 03:34.171
- Ross...
- It's all working out.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.966
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.261
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

03:42.013 --> 03:43.347
No.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.641
We should all have dinner.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.976
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

03:48.144 --> 03:51.772
Wow. Uh, look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.107
Weird? What? What's weird? Huh?

03:54.275 --> 03:57.361
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

03:57.528 --> 03:59.571
...because I'm making fajitas!

04:07.538 --> 04:09.289
I do like fajitas.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.503
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.214
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

04:18.382 --> 04:22.302
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.096
There's a hair in my coffee.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.724
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.936
Have you seen Frank Jr?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.188
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

04:33.356 --> 04:35.816
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.402
Oh, that's sweet.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.570
Drink your hair.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.864
Hey, what's all this stuff?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.701
Oh, they're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.287
Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.289
Get this one.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.833
That's not really how it works.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.794
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

04:57.005 --> 05:00.007
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

05:00.174 --> 05:03.176
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.178
- Thanks, that would be great.
- Sure.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.763
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

05:11.394 --> 05:14.229
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.648
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.610
That's not what we talked about!

05:21.029 --> 05:22.863
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.366
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.994
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

05:29.203 --> 05:33.081
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

05:33.291 --> 05:36.209
Oh, well, uh, uh,
that's, uh, Frank Jr. Jr...

05:36.377 --> 05:39.338
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

05:39.505 --> 05:43.800
And, uh, that's, uh, Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.263
And, uh, that's Leslie
throwing bagels at him.

05:48.639 --> 05:52.059
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

05:54.771 --> 05:59.066
Oh, can I just say, I know we're doing
this for Ross and that's cool.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.736
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.280
Well, what would we be doing?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.366
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

06:07.533 --> 06:12.579
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.207
Feel me up?

06:15.416 --> 06:17.209
In a carriage.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.004
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.964
- Hi.
- Hey. Hmm.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.383
So...

06:24.759 --> 06:26.051
...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.761
- Mm.
Mm-hm.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.347
So did you, uh,
bring a little something for Ross?

06:30.515 --> 06:34.142
Actually, uh, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.062
Oh, well, thanks.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.731
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.651
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
Heh, heh.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.117
Ah, I thought I heard voices.
What? Ha, ha.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.035
Hi, Charlie. Mwah.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.746
- Hey, Joey. Ha.
- Hey.

06:54.914 --> 06:59.000
And, uh, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

07:01.879 --> 07:06.758
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know... Uh...

07:07.510 --> 07:09.719
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.097
Okay.
Uh, well, we brought you some wine.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.934
Oh. Ah. That is so thoughtful.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.311
She's a keeper. Ha.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.566
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Uh, actually, that's, uh...

07:22.733 --> 07:24.776
Underwear, a toothbrush...

07:24.944 --> 07:27.070
...and a Van Halen CD.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.865
I can use all these things!

07:31.200 --> 07:33.577
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little, um...

07:33.744 --> 07:36.121
What? Fine? Because I am, huh?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.623
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
You see?

07:38.791 --> 07:40.917
Who else is fine?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.878
- Ha, ha.
- Come on.

07:43.087 --> 07:46.173
Listen. Why don't you, uh, try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.216
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.011
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.310
Oh, God.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.270
So adorable.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.398
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

08:03.566 --> 08:07.152
- Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
- Mm.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.988
...because, uh, before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.534
Well, they may be a handful...

08:14.702 --> 08:16.703
...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.582
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing. Ha, ha.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.877
I haven't slept in four years.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.923
That's a long time.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.383
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.385
There's just so many of them.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.221
You know, two I could handle.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.932
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.477
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

08:40.645 --> 08:43.480
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.650
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.901
Yeah, I know, Frank.

08:48.069 --> 08:51.363
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.742
Sometimes, I think that, uh...

08:56.369 --> 09:00.539
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.375
What?

09:03.584 --> 09:05.877
No, no, I can't.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.465
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.802
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.847
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

09:18.015 --> 09:22.143
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.979
What?

09:24.647 --> 09:28.567
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

09:33.447 --> 09:34.990
Thank you so much for seeing us.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.158
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.202
Oh, please, we're happy to help.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.997
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

09:42.164 --> 09:46.293
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

09:52.174 --> 09:54.968
I mean, you have a lovely home.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.387
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

09:57.555 --> 10:01.016
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.267
It's pretty much...

10:02.435 --> 10:04.269
...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.647
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.650
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.901
Thank you.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.446
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.037
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.290
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.751
That's great. Can I see the book?

10:28.961 --> 10:32.005
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

10:32.256 --> 10:35.258
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.553
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.348
I would have told him to do it too.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.599
Can I adopt you?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.104
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.815
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.527
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.281
- Huh?
- You know how to use a compass?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.033
I have a badge in it.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.452
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.996
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.457
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.250
What?

11:15.049 --> 11:16.841
What?!

11:18.052 --> 11:20.428
I'm adopted?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.807
I got nothing.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.942
Well, that first batch of
margaritas was not so great...

11:34.110 --> 11:37.570
...but this second batch is good.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.534
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.078
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.539
You know, just the four of us.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.874
Just hanging. Ha.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.668
Dude, are you okay?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.753
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

11:55.297 --> 11:58.299
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.428
I'm just...
I'm just proud of us.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.056
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.267
No awareness.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.354
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.232
You know, oh, let's take a trip!

12:15.985 --> 12:18.445
Okay, where do you think we can go?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.614
My fajitas!

12:23.951 --> 12:27.078
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

12:27.246 --> 12:31.374
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.209
He normally doesn't drink like this.

12:33.377 --> 12:37.255
Oh, you know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

12:40.050 --> 12:43.678
Oh, I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

12:45.806 --> 12:50.185
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

12:50.352 --> 12:52.395
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.735
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.239
Okay, well, this is crazy.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.910
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.703
Oh, no, of course we're not.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.497
- That's insane.
- I know.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.165
Alice would never go for it.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.585
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.549
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

13:21.717 --> 13:23.885
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

13:24.428 --> 13:25.845
Huh.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.347
Frank Jr. Jr?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.225
You'd be getting a really good one.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.186
I mean, you know,
he's really funny.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.981
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

13:37.733 --> 13:40.401
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

13:41.862 --> 13:43.154
A talking frog.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.994
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny. Ha, ha.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.497
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about, um, Leslie?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.458
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.504
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.423
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.802
Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.470
I got big hopes for her.

14:07.638 --> 14:12.267
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.897
Wow, Frank. Ha.
I think we just ran out of kids.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.150
Oh, I think you're right.

14:23.487 --> 14:28.783
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.704
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.501
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.921
You know, I'll help out more.
I can babysit anytime you want.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.756
You name the day and I'll be there.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.301
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.179
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.807
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.018
Tsk. You'd do that for us?

14:55.185 --> 14:57.478
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.773
Tsk. Oh.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.987
Oh, look at them.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.782
Oh. I love you so much.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.494
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

15:16.415 --> 15:19.542
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.795
- Can you believe how nice they are?
- We have to leave.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.300
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

15:27.509 --> 15:30.386
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.264
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

15:33.432 --> 15:34.766
...I may have told him.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.436
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.606
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi. Ha.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.733
Some little snacks for everybody.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.277
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.030
I'll get him in a second.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.533
Uh, by the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.411
But kids are so intuitive.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.914
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

15:58.123 --> 16:01.459
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.045
What? Where did you hear that?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.338
He told me.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.510
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.721
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.643
You told him he's adopted?

16:18.852 --> 16:21.562
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.857
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.859
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted...

16:27.027 --> 16:28.569
...and he also thinks Santa is real."

16:28.737 --> 16:30.488
He isn't?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.033
We have to get out of here, baby.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.665
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

16:40.833 --> 16:43.793
...to Rachel and Joey.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.798
And to love.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.885
Ah, love!

16:53.053 --> 16:54.762
Mm.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.306
L-O-V-E. Love.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.600
I is for "life."

16:59.768 --> 17:02.353
And what is life without love?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.939
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.737
O is for:

17:11.696 --> 17:13.823
"Oh, wow!"

17:16.702 --> 17:20.371
The V is for this...

17:20.539 --> 17:24.541
...very surprising turn of events...

17:24.835 --> 17:28.421
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.300
E...

17:35.095 --> 17:36.888
...is for how...

17:37.056 --> 17:41.017
...extremely normal I find it...

17:41.185 --> 17:43.311
...that you two...

17:44.480 --> 17:45.772
...are together.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.486
And that one day
you might get married...

17:53.739 --> 17:56.657
...and have children of your own.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.831
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.210
Ross, you don't seem okay.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.545
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.096
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.891
Wait, Ross. Ross, I, um...
I have to take off.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.893
- No!
- I'm sorry.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.729
I have an early class in the morning.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.316
But this has been lovely.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.154
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.657
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

18:38.784 --> 18:43.079
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.914
- Okay.
- All right.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.128
Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just...

18:50.337 --> 18:53.506
Oh, that's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.424
Fine.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.305
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.141
Hey.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.351
Hey, that rhymes.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.690
You know what, Ross,
I think, uh, we're gonna take off too.

19:10.858 --> 19:15.820
Oh, oh. Heh.
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.530
You guys are a couple now.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.158
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.995
- No, it's just getting late...
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.123
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.132
I don't even know what that's for.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.222
You know what?

19:43.515 --> 19:46.517
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.103
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.856
Uh-huh. Okay.
- All right.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.858
Yeah, you know, Joey, I...

19:54.026 --> 19:57.486
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.156
- It doesn't look good, does it?
- Mm-mm.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.302
Morning.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.347
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

20:24.514 --> 20:28.309
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.939
So you took off my pants and shoes?

20:33.106 --> 20:34.815
No. No, no.

20:34.983 --> 20:39.028
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.367
Ahem. Look, uh, Ross...

20:44.534 --> 20:47.995
...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

20:48.163 --> 20:50.373
...because nothing's gonna happen.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.791
What do you mean?

20:53.502 --> 20:55.253
She and I said from the beginning...

20:55.420 --> 20:58.339
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.882
And clearly...

21:00.050 --> 21:02.802
What are you talking about? I'm fine.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.931
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.058
Of course you're not fine. You're...

21:11.770 --> 21:13.604
You're Ross and Rachel.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.109
Yeah, except we're not.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.446
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

21:24.116 --> 21:26.617
...six years.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.955
My God, is that right?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.748
Has it been that long?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.127
That's what I hear, yeah.

21:37.629 --> 21:41.424
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

21:41.591 --> 21:44.885
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

21:46.179 --> 21:48.222
Can I ask you something?

21:48.390 --> 21:49.849
Really...

21:50.767 --> 21:53.185
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

21:55.439 --> 21:59.108
Come on, you know me. Ha, ha.
You know...

22:00.360 --> 22:01.402
Joey.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.328
I'm crazy about her.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.210
And she feels the same way?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.256
I think so.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.344
Well, then...

22:26.511 --> 22:28.721
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.891
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so...

22:32.059 --> 22:35.144
No, but I want to be.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.146
And hey:

22:37.314 --> 22:39.023
I will be.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.820
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

22:44.988 --> 22:47.490
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

22:47.657 --> 22:50.242
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

22:51.453 --> 22:55.081
No, that was, uh...
That was just for me.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.586
Hey, you, uh?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.546
You sure about this?

23:02.714 --> 23:05.424
Yeah, I'm sure.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.178
And...

23:10.138 --> 23:12.014
...we're okay?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.152
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.488
Um, we just want to give
you a heads up.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.615
Bill and Colleen hate us.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.159
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.494
What?

23:33.662 --> 23:35.871
Still, he had to find out sometime.

23:36.039 --> 23:40.251
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

23:44.631 --> 23:47.133
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
