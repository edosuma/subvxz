00:24.291 --> 00:25.526
You clocking my city.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.361
It gonna be a problem if I am?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.196
Only one way to find out.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.665
<i>Let's find out, then.</i>

00:31.699 --> 00:35.302
Think again, <i>mano.</i>
I need you, and you need me.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.637
So it's 50-50.

00:38.672 --> 00:39.807
50-50.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.643
You think you throw that big
of a shadow

00:42.676 --> 00:46.147
that the Chicago Serbs
got you on they list?

00:46.180 --> 00:48.816
Maybe my old partner
killed they boss.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.051
If this nigga Tommy is on
some type of suicide mission,

00:51.085 --> 00:52.219
nigga, then fuck him.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.821
<i>Now, I didn't run this shit
for 15 years</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.290
<i>just to stand by
and watch you on the tank,</i>

00:56.323 --> 00:57.725
headed to motherfuckin' battle
with this dude.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.460
Came here to tell you
that I wanna work together.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.429
You're about
to become obsolete.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.063
I've got something
that'll kick your teeth in

01:03.097 --> 01:04.298
<i>a thousand times over.</i>

01:04.331 --> 01:06.400
Just wanna make sure
I'm partnering

01:06.434 --> 01:07.835
with the right Flynn.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.136
You are.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.173
How about I kill you,
and we're even?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.712
And just like that, I'm up 6-0.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.789
You never should

<i>Rodovan Mirkovic.</i>

<i>You got one swing

03:31.645 --> 03:34.481

03:34.515 --> 03:35.683
it can't be undone.

<i>I hear you got a storm coming.</i>

New York is over.

03:55.970 --> 03:59.707
This my chance to get mines.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.715
Creeping up on me twice,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.283
it's a great way
to get yourself killed.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.518
I'm not too worried.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.620
You should be.
You got other eyes on me?

04:46.654 --> 04:47.655
Just mine.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.393
You're jumpy.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.527
I'm prepared.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.029
- For?
- Anything.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.698
Not this.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.800
No one's prepared for it.
You know why?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.769
'Cause no one's ever seen
anything like this.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.970
Yeah, that's a cool
party trick.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.540
This drug
goes beyond chemistry.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.311
It's fucking alchemy.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.048
And you ain't got
no way to move it, do ya?

05:14.081 --> 05:18.318
You got that big fucking
Flynn name, but no distro.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.654
You see, in this game,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.389
there's the suckers

05:22.423 --> 05:24.558
that walk into the buzzsaw

05:24.591 --> 05:26.460
and the motherfuckers
holding it.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.753
Welcome to my buzzsaw.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.696
Maybe I should sample it.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.964
Get an insider's perspective.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.066
No, I need
your science brain firing.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.002
Just take my word for it.
Best high I ever had.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.370
That's a big claim.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.639
No cap, best.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.575
No harsh crash,

06:14.608 --> 06:17.745
no cotton mouth,
no aftershocks at all.

06:17.778 --> 06:21.448
It had a trippy-ass vibe,
but not like MDMA.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.785
Warmer, like mushrooms,

06:24.818 --> 06:26.587
with the kick
of nice, clean coke.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.589
You make me wanna
drive my face right into this.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.157
No, no. Not yet.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.792
You think you can
break this shit down?

06:31.825 --> 06:33.627
- See what the fuck we got?
- Mm.

06:40.134 --> 06:43.904
It's a granular texture.
It's finer than coke.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.539
Yeah.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.908
- How were the drips?
- I didn't snort it.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.144
- Did it burn your lungs?
- I didn't smoke it.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.812
Anything chemically
come through?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.046
Chemically?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.982
<i>Chinga madre.</i>
Does it have an aftertaste?

06:55.015 --> 06:58.452
No. Kind hard to tell.
I mostly tasted lipstick.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.187
You wanna tell me more
about that?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.523
- No.
- Okay. Fuck it, then.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.657
No, no, no, no, no! Okay.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.126
I was kissed into it. For real.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.961
Adorable. By whom?

07:07.995 --> 07:10.130
Claudia Flynn.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.566
Th-that's a great sales pitch.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.067
It was a little over the top.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.738
You liked it.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.106
Will you please
just step on this shit?

07:19.139 --> 07:20.607
Let's see what the fuck we got.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.477
I would buy drugs, too,
if Claudia Flynn kissed me.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.480
Just-just step on this shit.
Go get your bag.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.682
All right. Let's start easy.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.928
<i>Hey, Sampson.</i>

07:42.162 --> 07:43.764
Get over here.

07:47.534 --> 07:48.902
<i>Get up against the car.</i>

07:48.936 --> 07:50.237
I said get up
against the fucking car.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.505
- Come on.
- So what?

07:51.538 --> 07:53.640
Jogging is a crime, too, now?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.175
Lace 'em. Lace 'em!

07:56.877 --> 07:58.478
Get the fuck in the car.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.782
Get in the fucking car
right now.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.158
You been
coming to me like

08:11.191 --> 08:12.860
we know each other
or something.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.828
Like we got
some kind of history.

08:16.063 --> 08:20.167
Your bad batch in '06
killed five people.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.036
I pulled that off the streets
as soon as I knew it was cut toxic.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.706
It wasn't soon enough.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.674
You know the name Kiki Watkins?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.144
I don't.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.813
She's one of the people
whose lives

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
will never be the same
because of you.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.819
I spent 15 years making amends.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.288
You convicts.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.959
You always talk about how
you found God or Jesus

08:45.993 --> 08:48.262
or whatever the fuck.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.231
And we're all supposed
to just go along

08:51.265 --> 08:54.568
for the spiritual ride
with you, is that right?

08:54.601 --> 08:56.203
Well, what about you?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.272
What about me?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.908
Are you gonna change?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.976
Or are you just gonna continue
to take that white man's money

09:03.010 --> 09:04.811
to look the other way?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.180
How the fuck
do you know about that?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.949
Don't matter how I know.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.618
Only matters
that other cops don't.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.591
<i>See, there were a few
dirty cops inside with me.</i>

09:17.624 --> 09:18.959
Y'all don't do so well
in there.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.661
Get the fuck out of my car.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.965
We both got a past
that we can't do nothing about.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.736
All we can do is move forward.

09:42.316 --> 09:44.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.154
You know what, E?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.322
What's the word?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.791
That nigga Diamond
handed me the kingdom

09:50.824 --> 09:53.260
when I ain't really know shit
about the game.

09:53.293 --> 09:58.098
But I learned, right?
I evolved. Eclipsed, nigga.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.599
For sure.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.867
Now I'm watching
these moves he making

10:00.901 --> 10:03.971
with that white boy,
and I can't lie, bro.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.140
That shit hurt, E. That shit hurt.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.842
I feel that.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.244
Nigga, I ain't put in
all this motherfucking time

10:11.278 --> 10:15.215
making us stronger to be
disrespected, disregarded.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.050
Bro, it was supposed
to be us two

10:17.084 --> 10:19.019
when that nigga came home
from jail, bro.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.722
You feel me?
The real brothers of CBI.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.027
Everything been fucked up

10:27.060 --> 10:29.696
since that motherfucker Tommy
came around.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.631
If you don't wanna fuck
with Diamond, nigga,

10:31.665 --> 10:33.200
let's bounce,
start our own shit.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.968
Nah, fuck that.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.370
I ain't breaking this shit.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.171
I put in 15 years,
I ain't moving away

10:38.205 --> 10:39.239
from none of this shit, nigga.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.676
CBI is just as much mine
as it is his.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.090
Does someone want to tell me

10:57.124 --> 10:59.026
how the fuck James St. Patrick's partner

10:59.059 --> 11:00.994
took out Tatiana in Chicago

11:01.028 --> 11:02.996
and no one fucking stopped him?

11:03.030 --> 11:06.933
Who fucking cares?
Tatiana was weak.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.777
What about you, Zivko?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.213
Anything you need,

11:20.981 --> 11:22.349
Mr. Mircović.

11:27.187 --> 11:32.192
What I need...is to kill Tommy fuckin' Egan.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.369
[Tommy, in English] Damn.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.337
We only have a few runs left.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.940
Yeah, no, I know.
I can see that.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.241
Look, if I can get you
more product,

11:48.275 --> 11:50.210
could you keep digging
till you get the cut right?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.879
Yeah. Yeah.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.047
I ain't giving up on this.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.184
Cool. Fuck it.
I'ma get you more.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.953
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- You're welcome.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.989
The fuck is you smirking at?

12:03.023 --> 12:05.292
We're, like,
basically partners now, huh?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.427
Oh. Fuck, no, we ain't partners.

12:07.461 --> 12:10.363
You must have caught
a contact high.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.899
Now that the Serbs know
where you at,

12:12.933 --> 12:14.167
how I'm gonna keep you safe?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.036
I don't need protection.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.304
You need a new zip code.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.407
Look, why don't you take--

12:20.440 --> 12:23.777
why don't you just take all
the bricks that we got and go?

12:23.810 --> 12:25.745
I could set you up
in a few spots.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.980
Not looking to be set up.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.182
You need to get
the fuck out of Chicago.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.784
I'm staying.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.819
Besides,
once I crack this drug,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.054
no end to what you
and me can make.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.356
You ain't listening.
There ain't no you and me.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.824
<i>We have history.</i>

12:37.858 --> 12:40.260
Once two people have that,
they have a you and a me.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.435
Will you do exactly what I say?

12:49.870 --> 12:52.439
- Yes.
- You don't go nowhere,

12:52.472 --> 12:56.176
you don't do nothing
without telling me first.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.111
Yes.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.248
- You keep working.
- Yes!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.416
Okay. Don't hit it.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.218
Bring me back extra, then.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.287
- I ain't playing.
- Okay, bye.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.321
Go.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.168
You haven't moved Dahlia
like you promised.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.538
I need to move
our distros methodically.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.572
Why?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.374
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.376
We have to be smart about this.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.378
We don't want other dealers
knowing about this.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.180
Fuck other dealers.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.948
We need to get this moving now.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.150
- I get that.
- Do you?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.518
'Cause you're not
acting like it.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.986
Mai.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.489
If you can't give me
what I need,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.858
I can take this somewhere else.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.426
To someone else.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.295
Everyone in the city's
gonna want it.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.138
I heard you making some noise

13:58.171 --> 14:00.907
by taking out part
of the Serbian machine.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.877
Tatiana's high on the list.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.378
Yeah, well, she had to go.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.113
You go in there undermanned,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.348
you really don't
stand a chance.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.016
Look, I know the Serbs
is coming for me,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.484
but say I go in there
with a bunch

14:11.518 --> 14:13.420
of hard-hitting
South Side soldiers...

14:13.453 --> 14:15.589
Then you stand
a real fighting chance.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.191
Look at us back
on the same page and shit.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.127
How much this fighting chance
gonna cost me?

14:21.161 --> 14:23.063
You a smart motherfucker.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.397
You don't make a single move

14:24.431 --> 14:26.299
without knowing
what the next five are gonna be.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.469
The man without the plan
is the dead man in the room.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.304
So what you want?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.607
A controlling stake
in the Serb pipeline

14:33.640 --> 14:35.475
and at least 51%.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.310
Ooh, that's a big percent.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.046
You'll get
a big hammer behind you.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.481
Yo, I wanna make this deal.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.251
Problem is,
I don't control 50%.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.954
He got a piece, too.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.657
You know the moves
he's asking for?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.959
I do.
I already made two of them.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.961
Yeah.
He bodied Tatiana's muscle.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.663
Kid's a good shot.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.033
- Five dead Serbs.
- And that's a good start.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.603
And like I said, all we gotta do now
is chop the head off.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.606
And you swing that axe with us,
and the money don't stop.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.208
<i>And we control the pipeline</i>

15:08.241 --> 15:10.343
<i>to the entire West Side
of the city.</i>

15:14.180 --> 15:16.549
You see, the Serbs
usually roll in packs of six.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.052
- Hmm. They're smart.
- Yeah, very.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.521
They get arrested, only a few
get locked up at a time.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.324
They get jumped,
only a few go down.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.193
<i>The city's deep with 'em,
so we gotta hit 'em in different spots.</i>

15:27.227 --> 15:29.262
<i>Take 'em out piece by piece.</i>

15:29.296 --> 15:32.132
Look, I know we can make
the moves, so let's talk money.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.467
33%, that makes us
equal partners on this.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.337
Technically, if we all at 33%,
that leaves one point out.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.173
All right. I'll give it up.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.409
Tommy?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.045
That one point kissing
a lot of profit goodbye.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.980
After a while, all them dollars
is gonna add up.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.082
More money equals more power.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.385
<i>And zero percent
of nothing equals zero.</i>

15:52.419 --> 15:54.587
That's a whole lot of bullets
looking for one man.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.956
I buy the ticket,
you take the ride?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.224
All the way.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.559
I bring
the motherfucking cavalry.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.361
And we run all votes equal.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.595
That's a huge play.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.030
All trust.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.067
What's it gonna be?

16:08.335 --> 16:11.504
I'll take it.
Put Jenard back in the mix, too.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.572
We gonna need him.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.007
Yeah, I don't know
about Jenard--

16:14.040 --> 16:15.108
These motherfuckers
are just waiting for me

16:15.141 --> 16:16.142
to pop my head up.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.578
I don't need nobody
telling 'em where or when.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.381
We gonna pull this shit off,
we gonna need everybody.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.753
I'm gonna need everybody.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.295
We got a moment here
to do something

16:35.328 --> 16:38.698
that no Black or white set
has ever pulled off in Chicago.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.467
Maybe that's 'cause
ain't nobody Black or white

16:40.500 --> 16:42.168
dumb enough
to fuck with the Serbs.

16:42.202 --> 16:45.238
They haven't done it
because they haven't had the numbers.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.074
We do. Us plus Vic Flynn.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.076
Whoa, hold up, now, come on.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.479
Fucking Abercrombie and Bitch
is in on this, too?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.414
Why you riding so hard
for these white boys?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.383
- What's up, bro?
- It's about the numbers.

16:56.416 --> 17:00.019
It's about locking in everyone
if we gonna pull this off.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.758
This ain't about
no Tommy or no Vic.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.727
It's about CBI going
where no Black men in Chicago

17:07.761 --> 17:09.129
have ever gone before.

17:11.164 --> 17:14.067
The Italians, the Irish,
the Jews,

17:14.100 --> 17:17.070
we been nothing
but they corner boys.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.472
If we want a seat
at that table--

17:19.506 --> 17:22.776
at their table--
we gotta snatch it.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.480
If we do roll
with team white boy,

17:27.514 --> 17:29.315
what we get in return, D?

17:29.349 --> 17:31.751
34%.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.087
Now, you a numbers man.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.256
Tell me what that is.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.458
That's big.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.264
I mean, shit, that one point'll add up
like a motherfucker.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.732
Puts us at the top financially.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.567
Exactly.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.471
Every move we make, J,
we get stronger.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.275
Baby bro,

17:55.308 --> 17:58.745
I got more days behind me
than in front of me.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.115
And I need you.
I need you with me.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.755
To the days ahead, then.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.326
All right. 34%

18:13.359 --> 18:15.161
We on our way
to running this city.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.262
All right.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.102
Did you crack it yet?

18:23.136 --> 18:25.472
No. You cop more?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.506
No.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.709
Where you been, then?

18:29.742 --> 18:33.279
Out. What's the verdict?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.582
You can't bond it
to any other foreign substance.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.517
It literally self-destructs.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.220
- Could make some calls--
- No!

18:40.253 --> 18:42.522
Don't nobody know
about this but us.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.792
And I don't want nobody
to know about this but us.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.660
What you doing with those?

18:47.694 --> 18:48.795
This ain't gonna work out.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.463
You gotta get the fuck
out of Chicago.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.633
And go where?
New York is burned.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.736
Can't go to Miami.
LA is fucking trash.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.171
Ain't you got no family?

18:59.372 --> 19:00.740
No.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.776
And even if I did,
I ain't bringing no dirt to their door.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.346
- I got nothing.
- You got all of these keys!

19:06.379 --> 19:08.548
- And then what?
- Unload them!

19:08.581 --> 19:10.283
And start again?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.418
You ain't gotta start shit
but a new life.

19:12.452 --> 19:16.389
I don't know any other
fucking life but this.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.158
Jesus Christ,
this is all I know.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.529
You know any other life?

19:24.631 --> 19:29.202
We chose it.
We gotta play by its rules.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.238
Look, I know
you could have taken me out, right?

19:32.272 --> 19:36.509
And I know you're doing this
for my protection...

19:36.543 --> 19:37.777
but I am good.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.947
I'm good because of you, Tommy.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.587
I'm gonna get you and me
dialed all the way in on this.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.324
Lay low, stay low.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.893
I'll be back.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.636
<i>You thought this shit
all the way through?</i>

20:03.670 --> 20:04.971
Yes.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.439
It's fuckin' CBI.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.907
Who I'm good with.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.842
This could be
a fucking bloodbath.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.212
I mean, worth the upside?

20:13.246 --> 20:14.781
Yeah, it's gonna be good, Simon.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.349
Trust me.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.484
We're gonna make
so much fuckin' money.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.320
Get to call our own game
after this.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.421
Yeah.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.257
I mean, don't have to rely
on anyone to bankroll moves.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.226
That's right--don't gotta go
to the old man, hat in hand.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.394
Set up our own crews.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.964
Yeah. Yeah, it'll be good, Vic.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.800
I hope it's worth it.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.635
It's a mainline move, Sy.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.403
I'm glad you're taking it
with me.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.874
- Fuck it. Let's ride.
- My man.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.318
I ain't got time for a drink.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.786
Okay.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.455
How much is you sitting on?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.524
It's phenomenal, isn't it?

20:58.558 --> 20:59.759
You got a good product.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.661
"Good"?

21:01.694 --> 21:03.463
Look, you called me.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.565
What would a deal look like?

21:05.598 --> 21:09.469
Uh, it would look like me
running point and taking 70%.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.939
Fuck you. Get out.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.040
Good luck.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.608
60-40.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.643
Fuck you.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.846
This is my product, my play.
60-40.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.619
Which way?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.525
- Yours.
- Deal.

21:32.558 --> 21:33.726
Done.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.462
First, I need you to run
some interference for me.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.872
As soon as you have eyes
on Tommy, let me know.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.916
[Tommy, in English] <i>Yo, how we looking?</i>

21:56.949 --> 21:58.518
Yo, we good.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.019
<i>You got everybody in place?</i>

22:00.053 --> 22:01.921
Hmm, and then some.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.524
Then we good to go.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.459
Appreciate you
coming through on this.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.628
<i>Why we making
so much noise over one person?</i>

22:08.661 --> 22:10.963
I wish it was that simple.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.865
It ain't never about just one person.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.413
- The fuck?
- Sit your ass down.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.752
Please, I got kids.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.854
Yeah, and if you chill,
you gonna see them tonight.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.793
How much you make a hour?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.828
30.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.697
You just got a raise, Bobito.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.732
Hey, you gonna say
anything to anyone?

23:19.766 --> 23:20.767
Nope.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.168
Yeah, you a smart man.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.403
You handled yourself
like a pro today.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.706
I could always use
smart people.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.441
What's in these barrels anyway?

23:29.475 --> 23:31.544
The goddamn future.

I was headed to the bar.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.124
I'll have you back
in time to open, I promise.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.894

24:54.927 --> 24:56.963

25:20.920 --> 25:24.624
I see trees. I see grass.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.058
It's pretty, isn't it?

25:26.092 --> 25:27.960
Yes, Vic, it's beautiful.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.896
What are we doing here?

25:29.929 --> 25:31.197
It's our future.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.201
I bought it.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.038
I bought the land.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.106
Victor.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.540
Come here.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.978
I'm gonna build that house
I drew on the napkin.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.280
You know,
with the wraparound porch

25:47.313 --> 25:50.917
and a swing
and the beautiful windows.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.052
That's west, so we can
put the deck right there.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.121
And then
we can watch the sunset.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.123
Mm-hmm.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.091
Watch the kids
play in the yard.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.162
- Vic.
- Hmm?

26:03.195 --> 26:05.798
- It's a beautiful dream.
- No.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.767
It's better than that.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.568
It's our reality.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.770
We can try and control
everything with our kids.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.973
But love's a fucking tornado, Walter.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.711
Are you seriously
gonna sit there

26:51.744 --> 26:53.112
and try and wax poetic?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.716
This is a fucking problem, Paulie.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.019
I'm just trying to tell you

27:00.052 --> 27:03.856
there's only so much we can do,
and then it's outta our hands.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.859
You have a chance
with your kids.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.861
I don't with mine,

27:08.894 --> 27:10.329
but you do.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.734
You got two kids
looking to take the mantle

27:14.767 --> 27:16.869
and only one spot.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.971
As soon as one of 'em gets
knocked out of the running,

27:19.005 --> 27:22.274
they ain't gonna think
about what's best for them.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.377
Only what's best for you.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.817
You're in a fucking jam, Walter.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.727
Yeah.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.867
- You got it?
- <i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

27:47.900 --> 27:51.437
And these two barrels,
it's cute, but we need weight.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.972
I got that all lined up.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.186
Okay, that's it.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.155
We're closing up shop here
for half an hour.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.157
Let's go.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.192
Come on.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.694
You too. Come on. On your way.

28:18.798 --> 28:19.899
Come on, folks.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.772
You too. Come on, step to.
Let's go.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.182
Two fingers, neat. Water back.

28:37.950 --> 28:38.984
Ah.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.398
I already paid Vic
for the month.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.167
Do I look like
a fucking bag man?

28:55.201 --> 28:57.436
I'm not here for the money.

28:57.470 --> 29:02.441
I just came here for a drink
and to see a friendly face.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.812
Didn't think you ever thought of me
as a friendly face.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.481
Oh.

29:09.482 --> 29:10.483
Yours...

29:18.491 --> 29:23.362
...is the face of an angel,
a goddess.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.065
A gorgeous abyss

29:26.098 --> 29:29.435
that no man can tire
of falling into.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.339
But...

29:35.274 --> 29:37.943
...this face is not the face

29:37.977 --> 29:40.146
that my son's
going to wake up to

29:40.179 --> 29:43.149
every morning
for the rest of his life.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.050
That's not up to you, Walter.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.954
And as beautiful
as this face is--

29:48.988 --> 29:51.423
and, Gloria...

29:51.457 --> 29:55.794
your beauty is
truly fucking remarkable--

29:55.828 --> 29:58.397
it will never be the face

29:58.430 --> 30:01.333
that kisses my grandchildren
good night.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.138
Not in any fucking lifetime.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.147
Maybe you should
just sit down, Walter.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.386
I'm fucking fine.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.263
Just to clarify,
the money that I owe you,

30:31.297 --> 30:33.299
it's got nothing to do
with Vic and me.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.234
That's where
you're wrong, sweetheart.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.836
Your relationship

30:37.870 --> 30:40.439
started off as a debt.

30:40.472 --> 30:44.543
<i>Now, if you wanna
pay me back in full,</i>

30:44.577 --> 30:46.579
just walk away from Victor.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.618
From... this.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.589
<i>You don't have
to answer me now...</i>

31:00.859 --> 31:02.094
...but...

31:04.396 --> 31:07.366
...you will
have to answer me soon.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.969
Yeah.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.412
<i>For the last three years,</i>

31:20.446 --> 31:22.214
<i>Flynn's shipments
have been consistent.</i>

31:22.248 --> 31:24.917
Everything he's done has been
letter fucking perfect.

31:24.950 --> 31:27.353
Got Claudia cooking the books.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.289
Everything's been FDA compliant
with the dialysis centers.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.890
It's been quiet
for a while now.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.025
He's getting ready
to make a big move.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.294
So we need to get inside.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.469
<i>And that's our way.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.949
And then we can come back.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.450

33:08.487 --> 33:11.123

Pop threatened Gloria.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.257
<i>There's no threat.</i>

33:12.291 --> 33:14.193
Went to see her,
we had a conversation.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.427
I gave her some advice.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.995
You haven't said a fucking word
to her in years,

33:17.029 --> 33:18.263
and all of a sudden,
you're there to give advice?

33:18.297 --> 33:19.598
Advice about what?

33:19.631 --> 33:23.202
- Hey, let's all calm down.
- I defined reality for her.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.070
<i>Nothing more, nothing less.</i>

33:25.104 --> 33:27.306
Are you really trying
to force my hand, Pop?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.675
Want me to choose
between her and you?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.744
You really that
fucking confident?

33:36.749 --> 33:40.586
You're a Flynn, and you will
die happy in bed

33:40.619 --> 33:42.521
with a good Irish girl.

33:42.554 --> 33:43.555
You got me?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.657
Yeah, that worked out great
for you, didn't it?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.784
He's not made like you.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.631
You all stay ready
in case I gotta call y'all up.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.601
You stay close.

34:35.541 --> 34:36.708
On the other side of this,

34:36.742 --> 34:39.144
you might just get invited
to the cookout.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.213
This fucking guy, Vic.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.584
Diamond told me you sweetened
our end of the deal.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.421
I was just doing what's right.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.831
Today changes everything,
y'all.

35:23.288 --> 35:26.692
You made so much noise
for such a small creature.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.627
I'm impressed.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.365
Would you like to continue
making noise for me?

35:36.368 --> 35:38.303
How about just a squeak?

36:06.198 --> 36:09.201
Where's Tommy Egan?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.406
Right here.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.719
I'm getting to see
the whole family today.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.556
My brother loves you
more than anything in the world,

36:30.589 --> 36:31.623
and I know you love him,

36:31.657 --> 36:33.759
but at the end of the day,
that'll never be enough.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.460
You don't know anything
about our relationship.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.462
I know he bought the land.

36:40.933 --> 36:43.402
It's worth 2 1/2 million
as it stands.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.939
I can have it
transferred to your name.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.975
You're kidding, right?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.476
Sell it,
and you'll be a rich woman.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.579
You'll have options.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.782
Money like that
gives you a soft landing.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.384
Ah, you piece of shit.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.687
Please hear what I'm saying.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.388
I'm here as your friend.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.858
You can have the dream

37:06.892 --> 37:08.493
and the happy ending
you deserve,

37:08.527 --> 37:11.463
but it doesn't include
my brother.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.999
So your father couldn't get it done
with his threats.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.336
You think coming in here trying
to buy me off makes you better?

37:19.805 --> 37:21.373
I'm not my father.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.641
Nah.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.445
You're worse.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.815
See, he's sick, and he's still
stronger than you.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.784
What are you talking about?

37:32.818 --> 37:34.519
Bitch, get the fuck
out of my bar.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.901
Where the fuck have you been?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.970
Where's your fucking gun?

38:00.345 --> 38:01.680
- Whew.
- That's one bite down.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.915
Whoo! Shit made my dick hard.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.651
I told you
it'd be fucking easy.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.959
Sy? Sy!

38:13.992 --> 38:15.594
Fuck.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.398
We gotta go.
Come on, man. We gotta go.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.876
What the fuck do you mean?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.878
Well, where the fuck is it?

38:34.613 --> 38:35.881
Fuck!

38:36.882 --> 38:38.717
Is there a problem, babe?

38:39.751 --> 38:41.520
Our drums of Dahlia
were stolen.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.355
We have no product.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.023
What?
How the fuck did that happen?

38:45.057 --> 38:47.459
I thought you had what's-his-name
transporting it.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.696
I did.
Piece of shit Bobito.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.834
I got people.

38:55.867 --> 38:56.968
I got reach.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.939
This is exactly
why you need me.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.874
I knew you were a mistake.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.377
Mistake? You're wrong.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.012
The only thing
I was wrong about

39:07.045 --> 39:09.981
was thinking you were the best
Flynn to get this done.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.585
Don't you fucking leave.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.455
You're worthless to me now.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.060
Get the fuck off me.

39:22.094 --> 39:23.729
We're done.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.493
Yo, E! Let's go!

40:42.040 --> 40:43.608
Motherfucker!

40:46.011 --> 40:50.448
Motherfucker!

40:52.617 --> 40:53.819
Shit. Come on.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.754
No, hold on, E.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.224
Fuck!

41:09.534 --> 41:11.203
Let's go!

41:20.111 --> 41:21.847
We ain't got much time here.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.049
This is a lot more
than a six pack.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.586
J, come on! Fuck 'em.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.763
Hey, motherfucker.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.268
Where's Mirkovic?

41:47.906 --> 41:49.875
Where the fuck is Mirkovic?

41:53.211 --> 41:55.947
What the fuck are you doing?
He was about to talk.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.083
Looked like he was
'bout to light your ass up.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.089
Yeah.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.595
<i>Hello, Tommy.</i>

42:10.629 --> 42:13.098
Enough bodies have fallen.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.900
You still standing.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.672
Eye for an eye?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.709
Nah.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.011
Let me talk to her.

42:30.315 --> 42:31.549
In time.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.855
We gotta find Liliana.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.556
Hey, we did
what we signed up for.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.592
Our work here's done.

42:40.625 --> 42:42.661
- She's gonna be--
- Our work here is done.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.229
We made our move with you.

42:44.262 --> 42:46.064

You're quite fond of her.

44:56.061 --> 44:57.462
That's a liability
in our world.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.030
Oh, yeah?
'Cause in my world,

44:59.064 --> 45:01.032
you stand up for your peoples.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.001
Enough of this small talk.
Let me see her.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.378
God damn.

45:13.411 --> 45:15.046
Fact is, you've done a lot more

45:15.080 --> 45:16.981
than she has to our side.

45:17.015 --> 45:18.183
That right?

45:18.216 --> 45:20.018
Then maybe you should
take me, not her.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.720
Or I can kill you both,

45:22.754 --> 45:24.489
which doesn't quite
make us even

45:24.722 --> 45:26.858
after all the bodies
that have fallen,

45:26.891 --> 45:28.793

45:29.861 --> 45:31.162
Fuck. Get down!

45:44.976 --> 45:46.778

45:46.811 --> 45:49.814

46:01.960 --> 46:03.361
