Another morning waiting
for the run-down school bus

00:44.125 --> 00:46.832
to take me
to the run-down school.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.332
But today is the day
I finally have the guts

00:49.541 --> 00:52.124
to do what I should have done
a long time ago.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.957
Nobody notices what I have
in my front pocket --

00:56.166 --> 00:58.915
a little surprise for them all.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.624
I prepared for this,
but still I wonder,

01:02.833 --> 01:04.790
will I have the guts
to go through with it?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.290
You're damn right I will.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.540
Are you okay, Cartman?

01:08.750 --> 01:10.790
Yeah, I'm good.
How are you, Kyle?

01:12.125 --> 01:13.957
They're all gonna pay.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.499
Every day,
they pushed me and pushed me,

01:16.708 --> 01:20.165
and if it happens again today,
it's going to be the last time.

01:20.375 --> 01:23.040
We'll find out today at recess,
won't we?

01:23.250 --> 01:26.832
Oh, yes.
We'll find out today at recess.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.999
Hey, Eric.
I'm not suspended no more.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.082
Good for you.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.915
I think someone's in there.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.540
No!
God damn it, no!

01:39.750 --> 01:40.707
Who's taking the shit?

01:40.916 --> 01:41.957
Occupied.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.207
I called dibs on stall one
for all recess, Craig.

01:44.416 --> 01:46.582
You can't call dibs
on a toilet.

01:46.791 --> 01:47.749
Son of a bitch.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.457
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

01:50.666 --> 01:52.790
I cannot go another lunch break
without my toilet time!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.290
Then don't eat 14 Eggo
waffles for lunch, fat-ass!

01:55.500 --> 01:56.790
All right.
That does it!

01:57.000 --> 01:58.040
I'm sick of this shit,

01:58.250 --> 01:59.374
and I'm not taking it
any longer!

01:59.583 --> 02:01.499
You all pushed me to this!

02:11.666 --> 02:13.582
What the hell do you think
you're doing?!

02:13.791 --> 02:14.957
I'm going to the potty.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.457
This is
the girls' bathroom.

02:16.666 --> 02:18.832
All right. I need to
tell you something, Wendy.

02:19.041 --> 02:21.332
- I'm "transginger."
- What?!

02:21.541 --> 02:22.332
Did you notice the bow?

02:22.541 --> 02:23.499
I'm not comfortable
with the sex

02:23.708 --> 02:25.207
I was assigned at birth,
so I'm exercising my right

02:25.416 --> 02:26.624
to identify
with the ginger of my choice.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.332
Now get out of my way.
I have to take a shit.

02:33.541 --> 02:35.290
Ahhhh!

02:35.500 --> 02:36.790
Get out of here!

02:37.000 --> 02:38.582
Don't give me more issues
than I already have, Wendy.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.040
Oh, wow.
This is nice in here.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.415
The girls' bathroom's
a lot cleaner than the boys'.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.124
What the hell is that?

02:47.333 --> 02:49.207
Cartman is using
our bathroom.

02:49.416 --> 02:50.207
Dude, this is awesome.

02:50.416 --> 02:51.832
I should have used the girls'
bathroom a long time ago.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.457
Hey!
I'm gonna tell on you!

02:53.666 --> 02:54.790
It's okay, Red.
I can take a shit here.

02:55.000 --> 02:55.915
I'm a dumb chick, too.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.207
I want to know just what makes
you think it's okay

03:02.416 --> 03:04.249
to go inside
the girls' bathroom.

03:04.458 --> 03:05.832
Because I'm transginger.
I looked it up.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.415
That means I can use
the girls' shitter.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.124
You are not transgender, Eric.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.915
You don't even know
what that means.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.999
Yeah-huh, it means I live
a life of torture and confusion

03:14.208 --> 03:16.082
because society sees me as a boy
but I'm really a girl.

03:16.291 --> 03:17.165
All right.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.999
Well, if you identify
yourself as a girl,

03:19.208 --> 03:21.249
you must find yourself
attracted to boys.

03:21.458 --> 03:22.165
Is that right?

03:22.375 --> 03:23.374
That's actually not true.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.624
I can be transginger
without it having anything to do

03:25.833 --> 03:27.124
with the ginger
I'm attracted to.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.290
Check the state bylaws.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.915
All right, listen, Eric --

03:30.125 --> 03:31.540
- Erica.
- Listen, Eric.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.624
You must know
why we can't have you

03:33.833 --> 03:34.999
in the girls' bathroom.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.374
All I know is I'm transginger,

03:36.583 --> 03:37.999
and you can't make me
go to the bathroom

03:38.208 --> 03:38.999
with the cisgingers.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.999
With the what?

03:41.208 --> 03:42.540
Cisgender.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.165
It's the politically
correct name

03:44.375 --> 03:45.999
for people
who aren't transgender.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.249
If you identify with the sex
you were born with,

03:48.458 --> 03:49.332
then you're cis.

03:49.541 --> 03:52.707
But then cisgender
is just normal.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.832
Saying "normal"
is extremely offensive

03:55.041 --> 03:56.790
to people who aren't
in that group.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.040
Trust me.
You don't want this hot potato.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.957
Just let him use
the girls' room.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.165
But this isn't a hurt
and confused child

04:03.375 --> 04:05.124
we're talking about --
This is Eric Cartman.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.832
Nobody else
is gonna know that.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.874
You better just give him
what he wants.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.540
So, Eric Cartman
just has us

04:10.750 --> 04:12.499
in some kind of
bathroom checkmate?

04:12.708 --> 04:13.957
Actually...

04:14.166 --> 04:17.624
it's more like a royal flush.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.499
- Gerald Broflovski?
- Yes?

04:23.708 --> 04:26.165
Brandon Carlile.
Reporter, Spin magazine.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.707
I was hoping you could help me
make sense of something.

04:28.916 --> 04:30.290
I understand
you had a very large party

04:30.500 --> 04:32.790
in your backyard last --
last Sunday, was it?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.415
That's right.
My son and his friends

04:34.625 --> 04:36.165
threw a party
for a kid with diabetes.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.874
I also understand that
the very famous pop artist Lorde

04:39.083 --> 04:40.832
was the entertainment
at that party.

04:41.041 --> 04:41.874
Oh, yeah.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.290
Yeah, the kids
were pretty excited.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.457
Well, it -- it's just
a little curious, you know,

04:46.666 --> 04:48.665
why a hugely popular
top-20 artist

04:48.875 --> 04:49.999
would play such a --

04:50.208 --> 04:52.707
well, no offense,
but such a humble venue.

04:52.916 --> 04:55.499
Sorry,
I don't think I get your --

04:55.708 --> 04:58.249
you understand we deal with
a lot of fake stories at Spin.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.915
We're just wondering
how the boys

05:00.125 --> 05:01.540
got someone like Lorde
to play.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.249
From what I understand,
she's the niece

05:03.458 --> 05:05.332
of someone's co-worker
here in town or something.

05:05.541 --> 05:06.790
You wouldn't know who?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.290
No.
Does it really matter?

05:08.500 --> 05:12.249
Lorde is an incredibly talented
and down-to-earth young lady.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.124
It would be a shame
if someone was

05:14.333 --> 05:17.332
having fun at her expense.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.207
Randy, whose are these?

05:34.416 --> 05:35.915
I don't know.
Why?

05:36.125 --> 05:39.915
Why? Because there's fishnet
stockings inside your jeans?!

05:40.125 --> 05:41.499
In my jeans.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.540
Randy, do you have
something to tell me?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.874
Yeah. I do.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.540
Come on! You've been in there
for 20 minutes.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.749
Yeah!
Recess is almost over.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.790
There's two more stalls
in here, gals. Go ahead.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.290
Not while you're in here.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.415
Oh, my God.
You guys are so cisgender.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.332
Sorry I'm different, but you can
just suck my clit and my balls.

06:01.541 --> 06:02.999
Eric, there are people
actually struggling

06:03.208 --> 06:04.999
with their gender identity,
and all you're doing is --

06:05.208 --> 06:06.249
Okay, okay, okay, you guys!

06:06.458 --> 06:07.749
You know what?
You know what?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.499
That's what.

06:10.708 --> 06:11.790
Suck my clit and balls.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.707
Erica, I believe
we have a solution

06:13.916 --> 06:14.874
to this little problem.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.332
I don't have a problem,
Principal Victoria.

06:16.541 --> 06:18.165
The cisgenders have the problem.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.165
If it is agreeable
to you, Erica...

06:20.375 --> 06:22.165
...we are going to clear out

06:22.375 --> 06:24.165
the janitor's closet
and remodel it...

06:24.375 --> 06:26.124
...into a private bathroom

06:26.333 --> 06:27.832
just for you.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.999
Excuse me,
are you talking about

06:35.208 --> 06:37.499
my own special
executive bathroom?

06:37.708 --> 06:39.332
Would that be agreeable
to you?

06:39.541 --> 06:41.915
- Oh, my God!
- That isn't fair!

06:42.125 --> 06:42.915
Wendy, just go with it.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.374
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy,
cisginger bitch.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.665
Of course, being forced
into my own isolated bathroom

06:47.875 --> 06:49.290
will probably be
somewhat traumatic for me.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.124
I might have to approve
certain aspects

06:51.333 --> 06:53.249
of this solitary location.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.749
Yeah, so I'm thinking
a water feature here --

06:56.958 --> 06:58.249
you know, get the sound
of running water

06:58.458 --> 06:59.124
and kind of Zen it out.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.332
Uh-huh, well, why don't you put
the water feature on this side?

07:01.541 --> 07:01.999
Oh, on that side?

07:02.208 --> 07:03.874
You know, because you've
already got A.C. over here,

07:04.083 --> 07:04.874
and that leaves this open

07:05.083 --> 07:07.457
for some nice big piece of art
on this wall.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.832
Oh, I like that.
That's gonna look nice. Yeah.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.707
Yeah, listen,

07:16.916 --> 07:18.665
I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.749
My wife is starting
to suspect something.

07:20.958 --> 07:23.290
I had to tell her I just like
the way fishnets feel.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.499
I know your wife
means a lot to you, Randy,

07:25.708 --> 07:27.290
but you can't
leave us hanging.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.957
You've got the purest shit
out there,

07:29.166 --> 07:30.249
and it's worth a lot to us.

07:30.458 --> 07:31.624
You think you're gonna get
a good product

07:31.833 --> 07:32.832
when I can't even think?!

07:33.041 --> 07:35.124
How many times have you said,
"I think I've lost it,"

07:35.333 --> 07:36.832
and everything turned out
to be okay?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.999
Every time.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.165
Every time.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.665
Come on.
Get back to work and see.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.457
If you get panicked again,
call me.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.624
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

07:47.833 --> 07:48.749
Yeah.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.957
You wanted to see me?

07:58.166 --> 07:59.499
Sit down, Ron.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.540
What do you know about
one of our artists -- Lorde?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.874
17-year-old girl
from New Zealand.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.749
Great songwriter.
Humble.

08:06.958 --> 08:07.874
Wrong.

08:08.083 --> 08:11.082
She's a 45-year-old man
living in Colorado.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.707
What?

08:12.916 --> 08:14.624
He writes the songs,
sends us the demos.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.124
We futz them, sell them
as a brooding 17-year-old girl

08:17.333 --> 08:18.207
way ahead of her time

08:18.416 --> 08:19.665
and nobody knows
the difference.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.790
Huh.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.665
Holy shit.

08:22.875 --> 08:25.957
He makes good stuff.
Stuff that sells.

08:26.166 --> 08:27.374
But he's getting itchy feet.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.124
I want you
to keep an eye on him.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.374
And if anyone around him

08:30.583 --> 08:32.457
seems like they're close
to finding out the truth,

08:32.666 --> 08:35.749
well, you know what to do.

09:13.083 --> 09:13.874
What is that?

09:14.083 --> 09:16.040
That's Cartman's new
transgender bathroom.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.290
Cartman's a girl now?

09:17.500 --> 09:18.749
He's not a woman.
He's not a man.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.665
He is something that
you'll never understand.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.332
But he would die for me.

09:23.541 --> 09:24.415
Is it done?
Is it all ready?

09:24.625 --> 09:25.832
All right, all right.
Move aside, everybody.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.499
Move aside, please.
I got to go.

09:34.416 --> 09:36.540
Oh, oh.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.415
This is gonna be so awesome.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.499
Lock.

09:40.708 --> 09:41.999
Privacy!

09:42.208 --> 09:43.499
Oh, this is gonna feel
so good.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.207
Perfect.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.915
Yeah, you're gonna take it.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.915
You're all alone now, toilet.
Nobody can hear you scream.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.582
Yeah, you're gonna open wide.

09:55.791 --> 09:56.749
You're gonna take
your punishment.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.582
That's right. Get ready.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.290
Oh, my God!
This is so awesome, you guys!

10:00.500 --> 10:01.415
It's just like at home!

10:09.166 --> 10:11.249
- Peter Nelson?
- Yes?

10:11.458 --> 10:13.874
Brandon Carlile.
Reporter, Spin magazine.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.499
I understand you work
at the U.S. Geological Survey.

10:17.708 --> 10:18.915
Yeah. That's right.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.374
I also understand
that you're the uncle

10:21.583 --> 10:24.124
of the amazing
and talented songwriter Lorde.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.082
All right, look,
I-I'm not her uncle.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.999
I-I just work with her, okay?

10:29.208 --> 10:32.082
Work with her?
How?

10:32.291 --> 10:33.582
I like Lorde.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.915
She's really nice
and really talented.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.415
But she lives a double life.

10:38.625 --> 10:39.415
How's that?

10:39.625 --> 10:40.582
Lorde isn't just a singer.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.332
She's also
a very talented scientist

10:42.541 --> 10:44.957
who specializes
in fluvial geomorphology.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.082
Uh, what?

10:46.291 --> 10:48.082
She just showed up one day
at the office,

10:48.291 --> 10:51.082
started filling in for a guy
who started working part-time.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.540
She's a good geologist.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.999
When her music career took off,
we thought she'd be gone,

10:55.208 --> 10:58.749
but she still shows up,
usually right after lunch.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.457
Hey, Cartman.
Heard you're transgender.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.415
Yep. You know
what Hillary says --

11:09.625 --> 11:11.957
You can suck
my Clinton balls.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.457
No, I'm not even
gonna get it done. I swear.

11:15.666 --> 11:16.999
He gives us
too much homework anyways. I --

11:17.208 --> 11:18.249
Hey, guys.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.582
Wendy?

11:21.333 --> 11:22.874
How's it hanging?

11:24.666 --> 11:25.457
- Whoa.
- Huh?

11:25.666 --> 11:28.582
- Whoa, wait, I-is that...
- Holy moly!

11:30.458 --> 11:32.832
Hey!
What the fuck, dude?!

11:33.041 --> 11:34.374
Do you mind?!
This is occupied!

11:34.583 --> 11:35.374
It's cool.
I'll wait.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.957
Dude!
This is my fucking bathroom!

11:38.166 --> 11:39.082
I want her suspended,

11:39.291 --> 11:41.165
and I want charges brought up
for sexual harassment.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.499
I'm sorry, Erica, but I spoke
with Wendyl this morning,

11:43.708 --> 11:44.749
and she's not comfortable --

11:44.958 --> 11:46.665
Wendyl?
Fucking Wendyl?

11:46.875 --> 11:47.832
Grow up, Wendy.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.540
You'll just have to share, Eric.
Why can't you understand that?

11:50.750 --> 11:53.082
Because I don't want a chick
watching me go poo!

11:53.291 --> 11:54.332
I thought you were a chick.

11:54.541 --> 11:56.457
No, I identify as a chick,
but I'm still a boy.

11:56.666 --> 11:57.790
You can't make me
share a bathroom

11:58.000 --> 12:01.874
with a girl that identifies
herself as a fucking dude!

12:02.083 --> 12:03.457
That is my waterfall,

12:03.666 --> 12:06.040
and those are
my Christmas lights!

12:06.250 --> 12:09.332
Dude! You need to put
a tighter leash on your dog!

12:09.541 --> 12:10.165
What?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.582
Do you know your girlfriend's
going around

12:11.791 --> 12:13.499
telling everyone
that you're gay?!

12:13.708 --> 12:15.665
Oh, yeah. She's got
the whole school believing

12:15.875 --> 12:17.832
that she's attracted to girls,
but she's dating you!

12:18.041 --> 12:20.124
So, what does that
make you, Stan? A girl!

12:20.333 --> 12:21.249
Sta-a-n's a girl!

12:21.458 --> 12:22.665
You better curb your dog, Stan.

12:22.875 --> 12:26.124
You better curb your dog before
people start ripping on you!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.499
Shelly, that's enough time
on your phone.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.499
Leave me alone, Dad!
Stop nagging me all the time.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.832
You know we're all
cutting down on phone time.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.874
Don't limit me!
You don't even understand me!

12:44.041 --> 12:47.165
Yeah.
I don't understand you at all.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.707
Lot you know.

12:56.208 --> 12:59.457
Oh, hey, Dad.
I need to talk to you.

12:59.666 --> 13:02.249
Oh, really?
About -- About what?

13:02.458 --> 13:03.957
Dad, is it possible

13:04.166 --> 13:05.499
for someone to be one way
on the outside

13:05.708 --> 13:08.040
but totally different
on the inside?

13:10.375 --> 13:12.832
I mean, can someone
identify as one sex

13:13.041 --> 13:13.832
but be something else

13:14.041 --> 13:16.624
but still have it
be nothing about sex?

13:16.833 --> 13:19.290
Yes. Yes, Stan.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.790
I am Lorde.

13:22.833 --> 13:23.707
What?

13:23.916 --> 13:25.832
It started off so simple.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.040
There's a guy at work --
Hansen.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.165
He would use the bathroom

13:29.375 --> 13:31.582
and just blow the thing up,
you know?

13:31.791 --> 13:34.749
Not only that, but he was
in there all the time!

13:34.958 --> 13:36.290
I finally got fed up.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.707
I pretended to be a woman.
I called myself Lorde.

13:39.916 --> 13:42.749
Have you ever been
in a woman's bathroom, Stan?

13:42.958 --> 13:46.832
It's all clean, and there's
enough stalls for everyone.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.165
It was so freeing.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.415
I started singing
while I was in there,

13:51.625 --> 13:53.665
and then I started
writing things down.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.332
But you said
you knew a guy at work

13:55.541 --> 13:57.332
who was Lorde's uncle.

13:57.541 --> 13:59.499
Yeah.
That's my cover.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.665
The chick
that wrote the theme song

14:01.875 --> 14:04.415
to the new
"Hunger Games" movie is you?

14:04.625 --> 14:06.999
Yeah. The record company
messed it all up.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.332
It was supposed to go

14:08.541 --> 14:09.832
♪ Hunger Games, ya, ya, ya ♪

14:10.041 --> 14:11.832
♪ Ya, ya, ya, Hunger Games ♪

14:12.041 --> 14:14.082
But they just do what they want
with my songs.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.165
W-Wait.
Lorde sounds like a girl.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.124
Auto-tune.
You want to see how I do it?

14:20.666 --> 14:23.749
I come up with all my best stuff
in the bathroom at work.

14:23.958 --> 14:24.874
I use this program

14:25.083 --> 14:26.874
to import the recordings
I make on my phone.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.332
♪ Ya, ya ♪

14:28.541 --> 14:30.832

Thanks.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.332
But it gets even better
when I add the drum loops.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.332
♪ Ya, ya, feelin' good

14:51.541 --> 14:53.499

15:19.666 --> 15:22.749
I don't know where I belong.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.290
Just hold it.
That's what I do now.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.124
Hey!
What the fuck, dude?!

15:40.333 --> 15:41.749
God fucking damn it!

15:41.958 --> 15:44.457
Why don't we just have everyone
use the transginger bathroom?!

15:44.666 --> 15:45.915
Stanley, do you have a reason

15:46.125 --> 15:47.582
for not using
the boys' bathroom?

15:47.791 --> 15:49.624
I-I just --
Two people close to me

15:49.833 --> 15:51.749
are having
gender-identity issues,

15:51.958 --> 15:52.915
and I'm -- I'm confused.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.124
He's cisginger!

15:54.333 --> 15:56.874
He's so cis, he wears
a jockstrap to bed at night!

16:03.625 --> 16:04.790
You wanted to see me, boss?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.790
Yes.
Please have a seat, Lorde.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.124
Hi, Carol.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.832
Lorde.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.374
Lorde, we're all big fans
of your music,

16:13.583 --> 16:15.957
and we think the world of you
for staying and working here

16:16.166 --> 16:17.790
even after your music career
took off.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.832
Well, my music
and fluvial geomorphology

16:20.041 --> 16:20.957
are intertwined.

16:21.166 --> 16:21.999
Amazing, yeah.

16:22.208 --> 16:27.582
Uh, Lorde, for some time now,
the females at this office

16:27.791 --> 16:30.040
have been pressuring me to,

16:30.250 --> 16:34.207
uh, find your own space
to go to the bathroom.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.249
Everyone loves you,
but we thought it would be great

16:38.458 --> 16:42.499
if you had your very own
executive bathroom.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.332
I like the women's bathroom.
I feel safe there.

16:46.541 --> 16:49.249
Being able to use that bathroom
is critical to my identity,

16:49.458 --> 16:50.249
to my music.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.374
My girls are big fans
of your music, Lorde,

16:52.583 --> 16:54.082
but the women here
aren't comfortable

16:54.291 --> 16:56.540
sharing a bathroom with...

16:56.750 --> 16:58.374
With what?

17:03.125 --> 17:04.790
With what?

17:15.125 --> 17:17.499
You are watching
"E! Entertainment News."

17:17.708 --> 17:18.999
That's how low you've sunk.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.499
It's been several days,

17:20.708 --> 17:23.665
and still there's no sign
of the pop singer Lorde.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.415
The singer went dark on Twitter

17:25.625 --> 17:28.207
after claiming severe depression
and stating,

17:28.416 --> 17:31.040
"I realize now that
I make people uncomfortable.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.290
I need to give this up

17:32.500 --> 17:34.749
and go back to just being
the old me."

17:34.958 --> 17:37.249
Spin magazine is claiming
they know the reason

17:37.458 --> 17:38.374
for the sudden exit

17:38.583 --> 17:40.415
and will be releasing
a tell-all article

17:40.625 --> 17:42.582
about the troubled artist
next week.

17:44.791 --> 17:48.457
Oh, here he comes, everyone.
It's the cisginger.

17:48.666 --> 17:49.749
Think you can
harass transgingers

17:49.958 --> 17:50.999
and use their bathroom?

17:51.208 --> 17:53.790
Yeah! What's the big idea
harassing Erica, Stan?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.082
At this school,
it doesn't matter

17:55.291 --> 17:56.582
if you're trans or you're cis,
right, guys?

17:56.791 --> 17:58.040
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay!

17:58.250 --> 17:59.207
What we have a problem with

17:59.416 --> 18:01.082
are cisgingers
who are intolerant.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.915
You know what we call those?
Cissies!

18:03.125 --> 18:05.082
Yeah!
Stan's a big old fat cissy!

18:05.291 --> 18:06.540
Oh, come on.
Lay off him, guys.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.165
Oh, what are you --
a cissy, too, Clyde?

18:08.375 --> 18:10.915
No, no.
Just he is.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.915
You just gonna drink beer alone
all day?

18:21.125 --> 18:24.165
It's okay.
It's gluten-free.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.082
All right.

18:28.458 --> 18:31.624
Do you know why young people
like Lorde so much?

18:34.208 --> 18:36.499
It's because
she's something different.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.124
Kids have had
pop-music artists

18:38.333 --> 18:39.957
flash tits and crotch
in their face,

18:40.166 --> 18:41.790
and most kids
are actually smart enough

18:42.000 --> 18:42.915
to be sick of it.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.082
Lorde represents
something in all of us --

18:46.291 --> 18:48.207
a truth
that wants to be heard.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.249
If I could talk to Lorde
right now,

18:50.458 --> 18:51.957
you know what I'd tell her?

18:52.166 --> 18:55.207
I'd tell her not to let people
change who she is.

18:55.416 --> 18:57.582
I'd tell her that if people
are making fun of her,

18:57.791 --> 19:01.540
it's probably because they've
lost touch with being human.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.332
I'd tell her to keep on doing
what she does,

19:04.541 --> 19:06.915
because when someone's
not allowed to express

19:07.125 --> 19:11.332
who they are inside,
then we all lose.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.957
That's what I would say
to Lorde.
