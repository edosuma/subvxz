WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.882
- WOMEN, AS ANY SANDRA BULLOCK
MOVIE WILL ATTEST,

00:07.966 --> 00:10.301
ARE HOPELESS ROMANTICS.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.929
SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF
THE TOUGHEST TYPE-A FEMALE,

00:13.012 --> 00:14.139
AND YOU'LL FIND A LITTLE GIRL

00:14.222 --> 00:15.265
STILL WAITING FOR
PRINCE CHARMING

00:15.348 --> 00:18.143
TO APPEAR WITH
A GLASS PRADA PUMP.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.396
OR AT LEAST A GLASS FILLED
WITH VODKA AND VERMOUTH.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.110
OH, I LOVE ROMANCE.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.237
- LOOK AT HER SMILE.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.115
{\an1}SHE'S ALREADY IMBUING HIM WITH
ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL QUALITIES

00:32.198 --> 00:35.618
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.245
THINK SHE'LL
TAKE HIM HOME?

00:37.328 --> 00:40.206
- IN FOR A PENNY,
IN FOR A POUNDING.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.626
- ELKA!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.463
- I LOANED HER
MY <i> SEX AND THE CITY</i> DVDS.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.965
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE.

00:49.048 --> 00:53.428
- I'M A SAMANTHA.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.139
- MAY WE PLEASE GET BACK
TO THE TOPIC AT HAND?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224
WHICH WAS ME.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.185
HERE'S TO
THE NEWEST SPOKESMODEL

01:00.268 --> 01:03.313
FOR TRES JOLIE COSMETICS.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.315
FINALLY MY LIFELONG DREAM
HAS COME TRUE.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.484
- SPOKESMODELING
IS YOUR DREAM?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.985
- YES, BECAUSE
IT TELLS THE WORLD

01:09.068 --> 01:10.612
I'M PRETTY
BECAUSE I'M A MODEL,

01:10.695 --> 01:16.326
BUT I'M ALSO SMART BECAUSE
THERE'S SPOKE-ING INVOLVED.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.328
PLUS I GET $1,000 EVERY TIME

01:18.411 --> 01:20.663
I MENTION TRES JOLIE
COSMETICS ON MY SHOW.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.333
AND $10,000 IF THE STORY
IS SENSATIONAL ENOUGH

01:23.416 --> 01:24.876
TO GO NATIONAL.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.171
- ISN'T IT A LITTLE CRASS
HOPING FOR SOME HUGE CATASTROPHE

01:28.254 --> 01:30.965
SO YOU CAN MAKE
A FEW BUCKS PUSHING COSMETICS?

01:31.049 --> 01:34.010
- IT'S CALLED
A SILVER LINING, JOY.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.053
[text alert beeps]

01:35.136 --> 01:37.639
OH, MORE GOOD
NEWS FOR ME.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.349
IT'S JOHNNY.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.728
OH, HE'S TOURING AND HE WANTS TO
KNOW IF I'M UP FOR A BOOTY CALL.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.189
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
GONNA GET STUCK BETWEEN

01:46.272 --> 01:49.484
A ROCK STAR
AND A HARD PLACE.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.570
- WILL YOU STOP DOING THAT?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.531
- I THINK YOU SECRETLY
HAVE A THING FOR JOHNNY.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.282
I MEAN, A WOMAN CAN'T
HAVE SEX WITH A GUY

01:56.366 --> 01:58.243
WITHOUT FORMING SOME SORT
OF AN ATTACHMENT, RIGHT?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.706
THEY LOOKED AT ME LIKE
I'D SUGGESTED WE ALL SAY

02:03.790 --> 02:06.876
OUR REAL WEIGHTS OUT LOUD.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.669
WHICH GOT ME THINKING.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.005
WAS I REALLY SO OFF-BASE?

02:11.089 --> 02:15.218
I MEAN, CAN WOMEN HAVE SEX
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED?

02:15.301 --> 02:18.054
- WELL OF COURSE WE CAN.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.639
- A MAN IN THE HAND
IS WORTH TWO IN THE--

02:19.722 --> 02:24.561
- SERIOUSLY?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.063
THAT ONE DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

02:27.146 --> 02:30.024
I THINK SEX WITHOUT
STRINGS IS POSSIBLE.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.903
OF COURSE NOT FOR ME,
I'M BOOTY CALL CURSED.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.363
I'VE HAD MOTHERS WALK IN,

02:35.446 --> 02:37.240
I'VE HAD MIRRORS
FALL FROM CEILINGS

02:37.323 --> 02:39.117
REVEALING HIDDEN CAMERAS.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.247
I'VE HAD PET FERRETS--
OH, GOD, MY LIFE.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.082
- YOU KNOW,
THIS NO-STRINGS THING,

02:46.165 --> 02:49.127
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT
TOPIC FOR MY <i> WOMEN'S DAY</i> COLUMN.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.880
ACTUALLY, I MET THIS
CUTE DIVORCED GUY

02:51.963 --> 02:54.132
WHO'S IN TOWN FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS ON BUSINESS,

02:54.215 --> 02:55.258
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD CALL HIM?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.927
- WELL, WHY NOT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.722
AND I'M GONNA CALL THAT
CUTE GUY I MET WITH THE TATTOOS.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.765
CURSES ARE MEANT
TO BE BROKEN, RIGHT?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.476
- AND I'M GONNA CALL FRED.
- FRED?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.563
- YOU MEAN THAT NERDY GUY YOU
PLAY CARDS WITH EVERY SUNDAY?

03:08.646 --> 03:10.106
- FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.900
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU
GUYS WERE JUST FRIENDS.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.361
- IF THE GUY'S A CUTIE,
YOU GOTTA TAP THAT BOOTY.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.288
- IF THE GUY'S A HOTTIE,
YOU'VE GOT TO BE NAUGHTY.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.666
- WHEN YOU SAY IT,
IT JUST SOUNDS CRUDE.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.639
{\an8}- THE NEXT NIGHT,
IN THE SPIRIT OF RESEARCH,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.641
{\an8}I WAS FINISHING DINNER WITH
MY CUTE OUT-OF-TOWNER

03:44.724 --> 03:46.601
{\an8}WHEN I DECIDED
TO MAKE MY PLAY.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.561
{\an8}- ANY RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR DESSERT?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.021
{\an8}- HOW ABOUT WHIPPED CREAM,

03:50.104 --> 03:51.022
{\an8}AND ME?

03:51.105 --> 03:52.398
{\an8}- CHECK!

03:52.482 --> 03:54.734
{\an8}UH, CHECK.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.985
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA
LEAVE MY CREDIT CARD

03:56.069 --> 03:58.988
{\an8}AND GET IT TOMORROW.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.365
{\an8}SHALL WE?
- OKAY.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.325
{\an8}NO, WAIT,
THAT SOUNDED CHEAP.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.660
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IF IT WERE
REAL WHIPPED CREAM,

04:03.743 --> 04:08.289
{\an8}NOT FROM A CAN,
THAT WOULD BE CLASSI...ER.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.541
{\an8}YOU SEE, I'M TRYING TO
HAVE SEX WITH NO STRINGS.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.711
{\an8}- AND I SUPPORT YOU.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.546
{\an8}- GREAT, SO LET'S GO.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.341
{\an8}NO WAIT, I CAN'T.
BUT SHOULDN'T I TRY?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.009
{\an8}RIGHT, SO LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.844
{\an8}- NO, WAIT, I CAN'T.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.513
{\an8}BUT I SAID I WOULD TRY.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.889
{\an8}BUT I HAVE KIDS.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517
{\an8}BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE,
SO HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.185
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M
WRITING ABOUT IT.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.520
{\an8}BUT THEY MIGHT READ IT.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.646
{\an8}WHY WOULD THEY READ IT?

04:31.729 --> 04:32.689
{\an8}WHY WOULD THEY
READ <i> WOMEN'S DAY?</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:33.690
{\an8}WELL, MY DAUGHTER
MIGHT READ IT.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.150
{\an8}I SHOULD JUST ORDER DESSERT.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.196
{\an8}AT SOME POINT HE JUST LEFT,
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.532
{\an8}SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH TATTOO GUY?

04:42.615 --> 04:45.535
{\an8}- OH, MY BOOTY CALL
CURSE IS STILL INTACT.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.537
{\an8}AT FIRST WHEN HE SAID
HE MIGHT GET A TATTOO

04:47.620 --> 04:49.539
{\an8}WITH MY NAME ON IT,
I WAS CHARMED.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.833
{\an8}THEN WHEN HE
STARTED TO UNDRESS,

04:51.916 --> 04:53.293
{\an8}HE HAD THE NAME
OF EVERY WOMAN

04:53.376 --> 04:56.546
{\an8}HE'S EVER SLEPT WITH
TATTOOED ON HIS BODY.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.550
{\an8}I'M HOPING SIS IS
SHORT FOR SISSY.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.094
{\an8}- WHILE JOY AND I HAD
CLEARLY FAILED AT

05:03.177 --> 05:05.096
{\an8}"WHAM, BAM,
THANK YOU, MAN."

05:05.179 --> 05:08.141
{\an8}BACK AT THE HOUSE,
VICTORIA WAS ABOUT TO ROCK

05:08.224 --> 05:10.476
{\an8}ROCK STAR JOHNNY REVERE'S WORLD.

05:15.481 --> 05:21.237
{\an8}- DID SOMEONE CALL
FOR 10CC'S OF ME?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.072
- OH, GOD.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.866
CALL 911.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.409
- [laughs] WOW.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.036
WAY TO COMMIT TO A BIT.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.037
- NO, REALLY.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.914
I'M DYIN'.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.208
- OH, BOY.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.089
- AFTER A NIGHT IN
THE EMERGENCY ROOM,

05:40.173 --> 05:42.550
VICTORIA FOUND HER
BAD BOY WITH BENEFITS

05:42.633 --> 05:45.094
HAD BECOME
A BURDEN ON BED REST.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.097
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS HAPPENED TO ME.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.100
I MEAN, I'M VIRILE, I'M TOUGH,

05:51.184 --> 05:55.980
COULD YOU FLUFF
MY PILLOW FOR ME?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.024
- AW, DON'T WORRY.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.942
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.779
ONCE YOU'VE GIVEN ME AN
EXCLUSIVE CELEBRITY INTERVIEW

06:02.862 --> 06:05.073
FOR MY SHOW
"OH, HI, OHIO."

06:05.156 --> 06:06.783
- I CAN'T GO PUBLIC.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.242
A HEART ATTACK WITH
NO HEROIN INVOLVED

06:08.326 --> 06:10.661
IS A CAREER KILLER.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.622
- YOU CAN SAY YOU OD'D.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.124
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TRUE,
WE NEVER CHECK.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.085
- NO.

06:17.168 --> 06:21.255
NO, LET THE MEDIA JACKALS FEED
ON MY CARCASS AFTER I'M DEAD.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.300
THEY DID IT TO MORRISON,
THEY DID IT TO HENDRIX,

06:24.383 --> 06:25.468
WHY SHOULD I
BE ANY DIFFERENT?

06:25.551 --> 06:27.637
- BUT YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.058
THOSE GUYS ALL DIED
WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.601
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.269
[crying]

06:35.353 --> 06:36.312
LOOK AT ME.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.981
I'M TOO OLD
TO DIE YOUNG.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.191
- JOHNNY.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.776
I KNOW
THAT THE DOCTOR SAID

06:41.859 --> 06:44.070
THAT MOOD SWINGS WERE NORMAL
AFTER A HEART ATTACK,

06:44.153 --> 06:47.281
BUT IF YOU CRY,
YOU'LL SMEAR YOUR EYE LINER.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.658
- EYE LINER?
- YES.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.161
"SMOKY SABLE,"
NEW FROM TRES JOLIE.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.956
I GAVE YOU A LITTLE TOUCH-UP
WHILE YOU WERE NAPPING.

06:55.039 --> 07:00.044
AND IF YOU LET ME MENTION IT
ON TV I GET $10,000.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.339
- VICTORIA, THIS HEART ATTACK
HAS OPENED MY EYES.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.383
- YES, AND NOW THE EYE LINER
IS BRINGING THEM OUT,

07:05.466 --> 07:07.677
SO WHY NOT SHARE THAT WITH
A NATIONAL AUDIENCE?

07:07.760 --> 07:08.845
- LOOK AT US.

07:08.928 --> 07:12.557
WE SPENT OUR WHOLE LIVES
CHASING AFTER MONEY AND FAME.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.892
AND WHAT'S IT
REALLY GOTTEN US?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.354
- MONEY AND FAME.

07:18.437 --> 07:19.814
- HOW CAN
A NURSE'S OUTFIT

07:19.897 --> 07:22.483
BE SO SEXY IT GIVES
A MAN A HEART ATTACK?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.527
- MAYBE IT WAS JUST
THE SHOCK OF SEEING

07:24.610 --> 07:28.156
VICTORIA DRESSED
AS A HUMANITARIAN.

07:28.239 --> 07:28.865
[text alert beeps]

07:28.948 --> 07:31.826
- AW.

07:31.909 --> 07:36.289
"THANKS FOR
LAST NIGHT, FRIED."

07:36.372 --> 07:37.456
- FRIED?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.543
- FRED'S PHONE AUTO-CORRECTED.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.087
I TAUGHT HIM
TO TEXT LAST NIGHT.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.382
AFTER WE PLAYED CARDS.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.426
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

07:48.509 --> 07:51.220
WHOSE BOOTY CALL
GOT ANSWERED.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.055
- SO HOW WAS THE GAME?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.558
- FRED HAD
VERY GOOD HANDS.

07:55.641 --> 07:59.187
I DIDN'T HAVE
TO BLUFF ONCE.

07:59.270 --> 08:04.025
[knock on door]

08:04.108 --> 08:06.068
- HELLO, FRED.
- MORNING, JOY.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.906
I'M LOOKING FOR ELKA.

08:09.989 --> 08:10.948
I WAS GONNA CALL,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.117
TO FIND OUT
IF YOU GOT MY TEXT.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.412
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,
CALLING IS SO OLD-FASHIONED.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.915
I'LL JUST DROP BY.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.959
- I'M GLAD YOU DID.

08:22.043 --> 08:26.464
YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT'S,
UH, CARD GAME

08:26.547 --> 08:29.884
WAS THE BEST
I EVER HAD.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.053
- NEXT TIME I'LL SHOW
YOU HOW TO DOUBLE DOWN.

08:32.135 --> 08:34.722
- [gasping]

08:34.804 --> 08:35.932
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

08:36.015 --> 08:39.268
BUT I TREMBLE
AT THE THOUGHT.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.229
JOY, MELANIE, GOOD DAY.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.730
- BYE, FRED.
- BYE-BYE.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.066
- I HOPE WE'LL
PLAY CARDS SOON AGAIN.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.402
- OH, ME TOO.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.119
- UGH.
THIS IS INSUFFERABLE.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.955
THE HEART OF ROCK N' ROLL
IS STILL BEATING,

08:59.038 --> 09:04.460
BUT THE REST OF HIM IS
A QUIVERING MASS OF NEEDINESS.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.128
- POOR JOHNNY.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.421
- OH, HE'LL BE FINE.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.800
NO, IT'S REALLY
THE CARETAKERS WHO SUFFER.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.177
- I MISS HAVING SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.137
LIKE FRED.

09:15.221 --> 09:20.601
TAKING CARE OF HIM
WOULD BE A PLEASURE.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.271
- WOW, IS IT
SERIOUS WITH FRED?

09:23.354 --> 09:26.565
- WELL IT'S NOT THE WHITE HOT
PASSION IT WAS WITH MAX,

09:26.649 --> 09:28.192
BUT WE'RE VERY COMPATIBLE.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.610
- GOOD HANDS.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.320
- MM.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.990
- HE'S SWEET AND FUNNY,

09:34.073 --> 09:39.328
AND WE BOTH PREFER
ANIMALS OVER PEOPLE.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.165
- SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE
YOU GUYS HAVE A FUTURE.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.167
- OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.794
I'M NOT A SAMANTHA,

09:46.877 --> 09:49.213
I'M A CHARLOTTE.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.132
I'M GONNA PROPOSE.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.677
- WHA--?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.761
- VICTORIA?

09:55.845 --> 09:59.181
CAN I HAVE SOME
CHOCOLATE MILK?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.767
WITH A BENDY STRAW, PLEASE?

10:06.605 --> 10:08.190
- HAVING DECIDED TO
GO ABOVE AND BEYOND

10:08.274 --> 10:09.692
THE CALL OF BOOTY,

10:09.775 --> 10:11.193
ELKA ENLISTED OUR HELP
IN SETTING THE SCENE

10:11.277 --> 10:12.695
FOR HER PROPOSAL.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.739
- SO WHAT ELSE DO WE
NEED TO SET THE MOOD?

10:14.822 --> 10:16.490
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU AND FRED ARE INTO.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.202
- RAWHIDE AND A TENNIS BALL.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.706
FOR THE DOG.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.710
- ♪ A PRETTY LADY
LAYS A LUNCH ♪

10:27.793 --> 10:31.714
♪ TO ASK HER TRUE LOVE
TO MARRY HER ♪

10:31.797 --> 10:35.426

10:35.509 --> 10:40.806
♪ THAT BRINGS
TWO HEARTS TOGETHER ♪

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
- JOHNNY SWEETIE,
UM, YOU KNOW WHEN I SAID

10:43.142 --> 10:45.603
THAT GETTING BACK TO WORK
COULD MAYBE HELP YOU HEAL?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.605
WHAT I MEANT WAS WRITING
THE KINDS OF SONGS

10:47.688 --> 10:49.023
THAT YOU USED TO WRITE.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.816
YOU KNOW, ABOUT
SEX AND DRUGS

10:50.900 --> 10:55.237
AND NEVER STAYING IN
ONE PLACE FOR TOO LONG?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.865
- NOW I SEE THAT SEX AND DRUGS
ARE JUST A LONELY PATH

10:57.948 --> 10:59.408
TO SELF-DESTRUCTION.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.204
- YES BUT IT'S THE PATH
PEOPLE LIKE TO DANCE TO.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.581
I MEAN, ELKA DOESN'T
EVEN NEED A SONG,

11:05.664 --> 11:07.750
SHE'S NOT MADLY
IN LOVE WITH FRED.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.377
THEY'RE JUST TWO
DEAR OLD FRIENDS

11:09.460 --> 11:12.463
WHO MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY
AND HAVE FUN IN THE SACK,

11:12.546 --> 11:13.964
SO WHY NOT GET MARRIED?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.716
- WOW!

11:15.800 --> 11:18.260
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE MY
FIRST SINGLE WENT PLATINUM,

11:18.344 --> 11:22.056
I'VE JUST USED WOMEN
AND KICKED THEM TO THE CURB.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.892
IT'S BEEN A HAPPY LIFE.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.061
BUT SOMETHING'S MISSING.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.897
AND IT'S THAT SOMETHING THAT
KEEPS DRAWING ME BACK TO YOU.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.609
- [gasping] OH, MY GOD,
IS IT YOUR HEART AGAIN?

11:33.692 --> 11:35.111
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.779
- YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.948
AND NOW I NEED YOU
TO MAKE IT WORTH LIVING.

11:39.031 --> 11:43.494
VICTORIA CHASE,
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.663
- THAT'S A LOT OF BEER.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.290
- WELL I WANT HIM
TO SAY YES.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.251
- TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT
A DRUNKEN YES

11:50.334 --> 11:51.919
TO A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

11:52.002 --> 11:52.795
THEY JUST TAKE IT BACK
IN THE MORNING,

11:52.878 --> 11:53.963
THEN YOU'RE STUCK
FOR SIX MORE DAYS

11:54.046 --> 11:55.256
ON A SEVEN DAY CRUISE.

11:55.339 --> 12:00.136
OH, GOD, MY LIFE.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.471
- WHOA! YOU GUYS, JOHNNY
JUST PROPOSED TO VICTORIA!

12:02.555 --> 12:05.015
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.059
- THIS HAD BETTER
BE AN ACID FLASHBACK,

12:07.143 --> 12:11.147
BECAUSE I'VE JUST ABOUT
HAD IT WITH YOU, MISTER!

12:11.230 --> 12:14.650
- OH, NO, WHAT IF FRED
TURNS ME DOWN TOO.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.027
MAYBE I SHOULD
CALL THIS OFF.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.154
- TOO LATE.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.780
- HI, LADIES.
- HI.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.533
- OH, WOW, SOME SPREAD.
- MM.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.785
- WOULD YOU LIKE
A ST. PAULI GIRL?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.329
- I'D PREFER
A CLEVELAND CUPCAKE.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.332
- [giggles]

12:30.416 --> 12:32.042
I'M GOOD.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.964
- MELANIE JUST TOLD ME
JOHNNY PROPOSED.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.507
- UGH, ONE LITTLE
BRUSH WITH DEATH

12:38.591 --> 12:42.511
AND HE GOES ALL
JOSH GROBAN ON ME.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.221
- DID YOU POP
THE QUESTION?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.056
- OH, NOT YET.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.476
OH, GIRLS, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME,
I'M CHOKING OUT THERE.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.560
- DON'T BE AFRAID.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.687
SOMETIMES YOU JUST
GOTTA TAKE A LEAP.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.814
- SADLY FOR FRED,
OUT IN THE BACK YARD

12:53.898 --> 12:55.983
CHANCE WAS ABOUT
TO DO JUST THAT.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.326
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
I CAN DO THIS.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.369
- WHOOOOOAAA!

13:07.453 --> 13:09.163
- DID YOU GUYS
HEAR SOMETHING?

13:09.246 --> 13:10.372
[dog barking]

13:10.456 --> 13:12.750
- WHAT'S WRONG, CHANCE?
- WHAT IS IT, BOY?

13:12.833 --> 13:16.712
- FRED'S FALLEN IN THE WELL.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.507
- IT'S CHANCE, NOT LASSIE.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.176
- NO, YOU DOPE,
FRED JUST TEXTED ME.

13:22.259 --> 13:27.139
HE'S OKAY BUT HE'S STUCK
AND HE CAN'T GET OUT.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.891
- TELL THEM IT'S A DEEP WELL
BUT IT'S DRY.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.560
- I'M ON IT.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.561
HELLO, NEWSROOM?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.563
I NEED A CAMERA CREW.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.024
I GOTTA TALK FAST
'CAUSE I NEED TO CALL 911.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.901
THIS IS GONNA BE BIG,
COULD GO NATIONAL.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.361
CHA-CHING!

13:43.447 --> 13:44.698
- MUCH TO VICTORIA'S CHAGRIN,

13:44.782 --> 13:46.450
"OHIO MAN TRAPPED IN A WELL,"

13:46.534 --> 13:48.536
DIDN'T GO NATIONAL.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.579
TWIN BABY PANDAS WERE HOGGING
THE COUNTRY'S ATTENTION

13:50.663 --> 13:52.414
AT THE SAN DIEGO ZOO.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.543
[giggling] OH, MY GOD,
THEY'RE SO CUTE!

13:55.626 --> 13:57.253
ANYWAY, EVER RESILIENT,

13:57.336 --> 13:59.255
VICTORIA DUG UP
AN OLD PHOTO OF FRED

13:59.338 --> 14:01.090
TO GOOSE
THE HUMAN INTEREST ANGLE.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.593
- THE TENSION HERE
AT WELL-SIDE IS PALPABLE.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.097
AS WE WAIT, HOPING THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT WILL ARRIVE IN TIME

14:08.180 --> 14:11.934
TO RESCUE SANTA CLAUS
FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.602
- FRED'S FINE.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.062
- AH, THIS IS ELKA OSTROVSKY,

14:15.145 --> 14:17.731
SANTA'S ANGUISHED SWEETHEART.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.441
NOW LUCKILY SHE'S
WEARING TRES JOLIE

14:19.525 --> 14:22.444
WATERPROOF MASCARA,
SO NO RUNNY BLACK STREAKS

14:22.528 --> 14:24.280
IN THE TRACKS
OF HER TEARS.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.282
- NO, I'M NOT.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.909
- I'LL BE BACK WITH
MORE LIVE COVERAGE OF

14:28.993 --> 14:34.456
"CHRISTMAS IN DANGER:
SANTA TRAPPED IN A WELL"

14:34.540 --> 14:36.292
OH, THIS IS A DISASTER.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.836
THOSE LITTLE SHOW-OFF PANDAS
ARE RUINING EVERYTHING.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.589
- WELL, AMERICANS LOVE ANIMALS.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.508
THANK GOODNESS CHANCE DIDN'T
FALL IN THE WELL TOO!

14:49.722 --> 14:54.018
- ELKA, WHERE DO WE
KEEP OUR DOG TREATS?

14:54.101 --> 14:57.313
TRAGEDY HAS STRUCK
A SECOND TIME HERE AT THE WELL.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.149
IN A VALIANT ATTEMPT
TO RESCUE SANTA CLAUS,

15:00.232 --> 15:01.942
THIS ADORABLE PUP,

15:02.026 --> 15:04.028
SHOWN HERE DRESSED
AS A SHEEP

15:04.111 --> 15:05.988
TO GO TRICK OR TREATING
FOR UNICEF,

15:06.071 --> 15:09.033
THREW HIMSELF
INTO THE ABYSS.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.743
WAIT--I'M JUST GETTING WORD.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.828
WE'VE GONE NATIONAL!

15:12.911 --> 15:15.164
[happy tone]
OH, THIS IS GREAT!

15:15.247 --> 15:18.167
[concerned tone]
AND ALSO TRAGIC.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.461
- HAVE THE FIREMEN ARRIVED YET?

15:20.544 --> 15:22.713
- THEY HAVEN'T COME
AND GONE, HAVE THEY?

15:22.796 --> 15:24.798
- NO, FRED'S STILL TRAPPED.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.634
VICTORIA'S PRETENDING THE DOG'S
DOWN IN THE WELL TOO

15:26.717 --> 15:28.802
SO SHE CAN GO NATIONAL.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.471
- GOTTA LOVE HER.

15:30.554 --> 15:36.060
- [crying] EVEN IF SHE
DOESN'T LOVE YOU BACK.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.355
- OH, JOHNNY,
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.856
- YES, LOVE SUCKS.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.191
I DON'T KNOW WHY
PEOPLE BOTHER, REALLY.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.651
[sirens wailing]

15:43.734 --> 15:45.694
- FIREMEN ARE HERE!

15:45.778 --> 15:47.446
HOW'S MY HAIR?
- OH, GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.405
MY MAKE-UP?
- GLOWY.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.449
- GOOD, GOOD.

15:50.532 --> 15:53.035
- FIREMEN ARE WORKING FEVERISHLY
TO EXTRACT SANTA

15:53.118 --> 15:56.830
AND HIS HERO DOG FROM
THE DANK AND HUMIDITY...

15:56.914 --> 15:58.415
WHICH WITHOUT
TRES JOLIE HAIR SPRAY,

15:58.499 --> 16:01.752
CAN REALLY DO
A NUMBER ON YOUR HAIR.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.420
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,

16:03.504 --> 16:05.506
I WISH I HAD NEVER
THOUGHT OF PROPOSING.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.882
- OH, ELKA,
FRED WILL BE FINE.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.176
THE FIREMEN WILL
GET HIM OUT ANY MINUTE.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.845
- THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT
VERY IMPRESSIVE EQUIPMENT.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.181
- NOT THE TIME FOR
<i>SEX AND THE CITY</i> PUNS, JOY.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.684
- NO, SHE MEANS
THAT BIG HARNESS,

16:16.767 --> 16:17.476
THEY'LL GET HIM OUT.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.561
- ACTUALLY I WAS
MAKING A SEX PUN

16:19.645 --> 16:22.106
TO CUT THE TENSION,
BUT YAY!

16:28.821 --> 16:30.572
- IT'S A TENSE
MOMENT, AMERICA,

16:30.656 --> 16:34.201
AS THEY SLOWLY LOWER THE RESCUE
HARNESS DOWN INTO THE WELL.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.120
- ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

16:36.203 --> 16:39.957
AND AREN'T WE ALL TRAPPED
IN WELLS OF OUR OWN MAKING?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.793
- AND YES, YES,
THEY'RE LIFTING HIM OUT.

16:42.876 --> 16:48.424
MUCH LIKE THE LIFT ONE GETS FROM
TRES JOLIE'S FIRMING FACE CREAM.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.217
- THAT'S MY CUE
TO LET YOU OUT, DUDE.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.928
- OH, FRED, ARE
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

16:53.011 --> 16:54.596
- I'M FINE.
- OH.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.766
- EXCEPT IT WAS KIND OF
HARD TO HEAR "THINK FAST"

16:57.850 --> 17:00.644
WHEN YOU TOSSED
DOWN THE BEER.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.771
- OH, WHAT A JOYOUS MOMENT.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.441
CHRISTMAS HAS BEEN SAVED!

17:05.523 --> 17:07.443
OH, MY GOD, WHAT'S THAT?

17:07.526 --> 17:08.444
HERE.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.944
HERE, BACK TO ME,
BACK TO ME.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.614
WELL, IT'S
A TRES JOLIE MIRACLE,

17:12.698 --> 17:15.951
AMERICA'S HERO PUP
HAS BEEN RESCUED TOO.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.618
THIS IS VICTORIA CHASE,

17:17.703 --> 17:21.457
JOIN ME TOMORROW WHEN
I DO SOME HARD-HITTING

17:21.540 --> 17:26.127
COMPARISON SHOPPING FOR
A NEW JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.213
- I'M SORRY, FRED.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.924
- ACTUALLY ELKA,
BEING STUCK IN A WELL

17:31.008 --> 17:34.136
A MAN HAS TIME TO THINK.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.680
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT MOSTLY
WAS HOW LONELY I'VE BEEN.

17:36.764 --> 17:41.643
THAT AND WHETHER THE BONES
DOWN THERE WERE HUMAN.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.936
BUT WHAT I'M
TRYING TO SAY IS,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.605
I'M NOT LONELY
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.608
I FEEL WARM AND COMFORTABLE.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.942
- OH, ME TOO.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.487
WE'RE LIKE TWO COZY SLIPPERS.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.906
- THEN SHOULDN'T THOSE TWO
COZY SLIPPERS BE TOGETHER

17:53.989 --> 17:55.032
UNDER THE SAME BED...

17:55.115 --> 17:56.658
PERMANENTLY?

17:56.742 --> 17:59.328
- ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO MARRY YOU?

17:59.411 --> 18:02.331
- IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.501
- WELL, OF COURSE,
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU!

18:05.584 --> 18:07.503
[applause]

18:07.586 --> 18:10.047
- IN THAT MAGICAL MOMENT,
EVERYONE CONNECTED

18:10.130 --> 18:11.965
TO THEIR INNER CHARLOTTE.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.384
YES, WE COULD
HAVE BOOTY CALLS,

18:14.468 --> 18:16.845
BUT WHAT WE WANTED WAS
A TRULY LOVING RELATIONSHIP

18:16.929 --> 18:18.347
WITH LOTS OF STRINGS.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.682
AND IN SPITE OF HER
PROTEST TO THE CONTRARY,

18:20.766 --> 18:24.186
VICTORIA WAS FEELING IT TOO.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.021
- SERIOUSLY?
YOU'LL MARRY ME?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.399
- [giggling]

18:29.483 --> 18:31.193
YOU KNOW, WHEN FRED
PROPOSED TO ELKA,

18:31.276 --> 18:33.695
IT JUST SUDDENLY
MADE SENSE TO ME.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.199
ROMANTIC LOVE IS TRANSITORY,
BUT LOVE BASED ON FRIENDSHIP

18:37.282 --> 18:40.369
AND HOT SEX IS ETERNAL.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.871
- HOW ABOUT WE
QUIT THIS FAST LANE,

18:42.955 --> 18:43.997
AND GET A RANCH
IN MONTANA?

18:44.081 --> 18:47.167
- OH, NO STRESS, NO AGENTS,

18:47.251 --> 18:51.713
JUST DOGS AND HORSES AND
EVENINGS OUT UNDER THE STARS.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.716
OH, I CAN
PICTURE IT ALREADY.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.682
- IT SURE GETS
COLD UP THERE.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.060
- AND I DO LOATHE
THE OUTDOORS.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.062
BUT WHAT ABOUT MANHATTAN?

19:07.145 --> 19:09.356
WE COULD GET
A LOFT IN SOHO,

19:09.439 --> 19:12.442
OR NOHO, OR WHATEVER HO
IS FASHIONABLE NOW.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.736
- OR MAYBE L.A.
I MENA, I'M NOT GONNA QUIT

19:14.820 --> 19:17.030
THE MUSIC BUSINESS ALTOGETHER.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.407
- WELL, MY FRIENDS AND MY SHOW
ARE HERE IN CLEVELAND,

19:18.490 --> 19:20.325
SO, WELL,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO COMMUTE.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.243
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER

19:21.326 --> 19:22.953
WHENEVER WE START
MISSING EACH OTHER.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.830
- RIGHT, LIKE WE DO NOW.
- EXACTLY.

19:30.878 --> 19:35.507
- WOW, I GUESS WE ALREADY HAVE
THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.467
- YEAH.

19:37.551 --> 19:41.597
I GUESS WE DO.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.724
BUT MAYBE SOMEDAY,
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE'RE OLDER,

19:43.807 --> 19:46.143
AND OUR AGENTS HAVE
TURNED THEIR BACK ON US--

19:46.226 --> 19:48.937
- EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOBODIES,

19:49.021 --> 19:52.399
YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE SOMEBODY TO ME.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.611
- MM.

19:55.694 --> 20:00.741
HEY, YOU KNOW, I STILL HAVE
THAT NURSE'S UNIFORM UPSTAIRS.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.743
- YOU THINK MY HEART
CAN HANDLE IT?

20:02.826 --> 20:05.746
- YOU KNOW A BETTER WAY
TO GO OUT?

20:08.832 --> 20:11.793
- AND SO, A BOOTY CALL
THAT STARTED WITH A WHIMPER,

20:11.877 --> 20:12.920
ENDED WITH A BANG.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.631
AND JUST A FEW
LOOSE STRINGS.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.592
BECAUSE ALL THE ROMANTIC
COMEDIES GOT IT RIGHT.

20:18.675 --> 20:23.221
THE BEST HAPPY ENDINGS,
ARE THE ONES WE BUILD TO LAST.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.526
