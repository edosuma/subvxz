00:31.469 --> 00:34.989
- For millennia,
mankind lived upon this planet

00:35.058 --> 00:37.613
without the need for
electronic devices.

00:44.274 --> 00:47.933
No smart phones, iPads or
gadgets running our homes.

00:54.837 --> 00:57.322
We learned about the
cycles of nature,

00:57.391 --> 01:00.429
the movement of herds,
the balance of life.

01:08.471 --> 01:11.923
We knew what to eat,
where to find it,

01:11.992 --> 01:14.097
and eventually, how to grow it.

01:24.038 --> 01:27.525
Our clock and compass was the
understanding of the planets

01:27.594 --> 01:29.250
and stars above our heads.

01:36.982 --> 01:40.641
We built our own shelters,
raised our families,

01:40.710 --> 01:44.645
and passed on information
by word of mouth, images,

01:44.714 --> 01:45.681
and then writing.

01:57.693 --> 02:02.318
Now, in just a few decades,
all this has changed.

02:02.387 --> 02:05.459
Now, the majority of
people in the world

02:05.528 --> 02:08.497
would have no idea how
to hunt and gather.

02:08.566 --> 02:12.086
How to heal themselves,
build shelter,

02:12.155 --> 02:14.951
and even communicate
without texting.

02:27.205 --> 02:30.519
Massive changes have occurred
under our very noses.

02:30.588 --> 02:34.730
Huge leaps in technological
evolution have destroyed,

02:34.799 --> 02:39.010
in one generation, what thousands
of generations developed.

02:50.435 --> 02:53.645
And all of this is
leading us on a path

02:53.714 --> 02:55.336
to a very dark place.

03:09.765 --> 03:12.940
To a place where we
know less and less,

03:13.009 --> 03:15.287
and yet, we believe
we know more.

03:28.197 --> 03:31.821
To a place where we are
completely controlled.

03:31.890 --> 03:36.308
To a place where total
disaster may be waiting for us.

03:36.377 --> 03:40.002
To a time where mankind no
longer rules on this Earth.

03:40.071 --> 03:42.383
Where we are told what to do

03:42.452 --> 03:44.765
by the machines that
we have created.

03:49.459 --> 03:52.601
Your entire life is
open for observation,

03:52.670 --> 03:55.914
theft, manipulation and control.

04:03.439 --> 04:05.993
The threats we are facing
in the very near future

04:06.062 --> 04:07.995
are immense.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.860
Criminals, terrorist
and governments

04:10.929 --> 04:12.655
are only just the beginning.

04:19.281 --> 04:21.837
We will soon be facing
the greatest threat

04:21.906 --> 04:25.461
mankind has ever known,
as we are feeding

04:25.530 --> 04:29.016
and nurturing the monster
of our own destruction.

04:37.646 --> 04:39.579
Welcome to your future.

04:57.976 --> 05:01.877
Let us just take a brief
look at what lies ahead.

05:01.946 --> 05:06.157
In our future world, there
is massive overpopulation.

05:10.955 --> 05:14.372
The world's resources are
stretched to breaking point.

05:20.930 --> 05:23.968
Our chemicals have destroyed
the bees and other insects

05:24.037 --> 05:26.695
that we rely upon to
fertilize our crops.

05:35.807 --> 05:40.501
Scientists had the answer in
new genetically-modified crops

05:40.570 --> 05:44.782
that are shipped to 3D printing
factories for processing.

05:51.789 --> 05:55.689
Genetically-engineered meat
and meals are shipped out to us

05:55.758 --> 05:59.313
via flying drones which
drop off on our rooftop

05:59.382 --> 06:02.627
collection points and then
return to their floating

06:02.696 --> 06:05.147
distribution centers in the sky.

06:14.743 --> 06:18.919
All our food is ordered automatically
by our smart cupboards

06:18.988 --> 06:23.234
and fridges, so that we no
longer even have to worry about

06:23.303 --> 06:24.994
where and what to eat.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.424
Everything is taken care of by
our super-intelligent master.

06:41.493 --> 06:45.187
The artificial brain
that now runs everything.

06:56.232 --> 07:00.754
We sit at home and interact
with our clever creation,

07:00.823 --> 07:02.652
because there are
now so few jobs.

07:14.872 --> 07:17.529
Language translators
are no longer needed,

07:17.598 --> 07:20.291
because our smart phones
translate everything,

07:20.360 --> 07:22.672
and speak wirelessly
into our ears.

07:36.721 --> 07:40.380
Teachers are redundant, because
the children are taught by

07:40.449 --> 07:43.279
artificially-intelligent
holograms at home.

07:56.741 --> 07:59.675
Drivers have not worked
for decades because cars,

07:59.744 --> 08:03.334
trucks, buses and everything
else is now controlled

08:03.403 --> 08:04.853
by a central command.

08:18.038 --> 08:20.385
There are no crashes and deaths.

08:20.454 --> 08:22.698
Less nurses and
doctors are needed,

08:22.767 --> 08:25.943
because AI diagnoses
and issues drugs.

08:37.126 --> 08:40.129
Smart gadgets predict
our future diseases,

08:40.198 --> 08:42.751
and measure our drugs
and food intake.

08:56.180 --> 09:00.632
Issuing commands of exercise
and monitoring our heart rates,

09:00.701 --> 09:03.118
blood pressure, body-mass index,

09:03.187 --> 09:06.846
and informing central medical
services of our progress.

09:21.584 --> 09:24.415
The world no longer
has the need for cash.

09:24.484 --> 09:27.625
Instead, there is a
universal credit system,

09:27.694 --> 09:32.147
where everybody is given a
living allowance and points.

09:32.216 --> 09:34.943
These are automatically deducted

09:35.012 --> 09:36.634
every time we
purchase something.

09:54.065 --> 09:58.069
There is no longer any way of
hiding cash under the mattress

09:58.138 --> 10:01.831
because money no longer
exists and has no value.

10:16.156 --> 10:19.988
The highest value jobs
in society are now those

10:20.057 --> 10:23.094
that used to be seen
as the lowest by many.

10:23.163 --> 10:27.202
Care workers, builders,
plumbers, manual workers.

10:27.271 --> 10:30.930
All these and more are
still carried out by humans.

10:30.999 --> 10:34.243
Anything that requires high
intelligence is now in the realm

10:34.312 --> 10:37.108
of super artificial
intelligent machines.

10:53.021 --> 10:55.506
The law has been taken
over by the machines.

10:56.748 --> 10:59.130
Unbiased, logical
and knowledgeable.

10:59.199 --> 11:02.133
Wise-thinking machines
make judgements,

11:02.202 --> 11:04.204
and cannot be bought or bribed.

11:20.186 --> 11:23.948
The news is presented to us
by computer-generated humans

11:24.017 --> 11:28.539
who monitor the world wide web
and report to us individually

11:28.608 --> 11:31.128
according to our own
desires and interests.

11:45.383 --> 11:47.903
Books are written
by smart machines.

11:51.424 --> 11:55.014
Art is created by
computers and 3D printers.

11:59.156 --> 12:01.503
Music generated
for our own tastes,

12:01.572 --> 12:03.436
as and when we require it.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.477
Our entertainment is
tailored to our own tastes

12:10.546 --> 12:12.376
by our new AI friend.

12:17.691 --> 12:21.316
Marilyn Monroe comes alive
again for us in new films,

12:21.385 --> 12:22.938
if that is what we desire.

12:28.909 --> 12:31.326
There will no great new film.

12:31.395 --> 12:33.466
There will be
individually-generated

12:33.535 --> 12:36.158
on-demand entertainment.

12:36.227 --> 12:38.091
Like action films?

12:38.160 --> 12:41.474
Then why not see Sylvester
Stallone battle it out

12:41.543 --> 12:44.028
with Marlon Brando
or Charlton Heston?

12:55.004 --> 12:59.181
Our super AI brain friend
will know everything,

12:59.250 --> 13:02.081
because we will
all have implants.

13:07.741 --> 13:12.091
Minute, tiny microchips
that are injected at birth.

13:13.299 --> 13:15.853
It will monitor our
health and wellbeing.

13:15.922 --> 13:17.786
Our loves and desires.

13:17.855 --> 13:21.169
Our interests and our sad times.

13:21.238 --> 13:23.930
It will talk to all the
intelligent gadgets around

13:23.999 --> 13:27.865
our house, constantly passing
and receiving information.

13:38.841 --> 13:40.498
When we go out for a walk,

13:40.567 --> 13:43.052
it will talk to the
world around us.

13:43.122 --> 13:46.332
Our lives will be constantly
uploaded, monitored,

13:46.401 --> 13:49.266
and controlled by the Central
Government Controlled Hub.

14:01.692 --> 14:03.107
We will not argue,

14:03.176 --> 14:06.421
because there will be good
reasons to follow this system.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.181
If you do nothing wrong,

14:08.250 --> 14:10.494
then what have you
got to worry about?

14:10.563 --> 14:13.393
If you commit crime,
then watch out,

14:13.462 --> 14:14.981
because Big Brother will know.

14:28.132 --> 14:33.137
One system, one credit point
bank, one law, one control.

14:41.076 --> 14:44.424
No more crime, no
more terrorism.

14:44.493 --> 14:48.601
No more starving, traffic
accidents, disease.

14:48.670 --> 14:52.260
We will lose our real
freedom for these benefits,

14:52.329 --> 14:54.158
and it will seem
to be a good thing.

15:09.518 --> 15:12.625
There is more to
come, much more.

15:12.694 --> 15:16.491
But for now, let us look
back a little into the past,

15:16.560 --> 15:18.976
to help us understand
our own nature

15:19.045 --> 15:22.290
and our own futile struggle
of the inevitable future

15:22.359 --> 15:25.016
we are walking
into like zombies.

15:42.448 --> 15:47.107
Let us travel back to the 18th
century and to Great Britain.

15:47.176 --> 15:51.733
At this time, the nation was
undergoing a rapid expansion.

15:51.802 --> 15:53.666
The power of the
industrial revolution

15:53.735 --> 15:55.944
was in its early days.

15:56.013 --> 15:58.912
Hundreds of thousands of
workers were gainfully employed

15:58.981 --> 16:01.432
in the powerhouses of the north.

16:01.501 --> 16:04.849
They worked from home,
weaving stockings on frames,

16:04.918 --> 16:07.576
and being paid for
everything they made.

16:07.645 --> 16:09.613
It was not a bad life.

16:09.682 --> 16:12.892
They were well paid because
there were not enough workers,

16:12.961 --> 16:15.481
and their product, highly
valued around the world.

16:34.776 --> 16:38.849
They had a lot of leisure
time, holidays and festivals,

16:38.918 --> 16:42.197
and many only worked
three days a week.

16:49.584 --> 16:52.794
Above these stocking
weavers were the croppers,

16:52.863 --> 16:56.453
who took the raw stockings and
made them soft to the touch.

16:57.626 --> 16:59.870
These were paid three
times as much for their

16:59.939 --> 17:01.734
backbreaking work.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.080
They were strong and powerful,

17:04.150 --> 17:07.015
both physically and as a class.

17:07.084 --> 17:09.914
As such, they were
hard to manage,

17:09.983 --> 17:13.642
but things soon changed and
by the early 19th century,

17:13.711 --> 17:16.473
and following a terrible
war with Napoleon,

17:16.541 --> 17:17.853
things got worse.

17:36.976 --> 17:39.944
The cost of food and
products had increased.

17:40.013 --> 17:42.222
Stockings were no
longer in demand,

17:42.291 --> 17:46.226
with the increasing, wide-spread
fashion in the new trouser.

17:47.676 --> 17:51.577
Soon, wages shrank and new
technology was brought in

17:51.646 --> 17:53.233
to increase efficiency.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.858
Less people were needed
and the pay was low.

17:58.031 --> 18:00.862
One man could now
do the work of many.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.969
A new frame allowed weavers
in massive factories

18:05.038 --> 18:08.870
to produce six times faster
than those home weavers

18:08.939 --> 18:10.389
from the previous century.

18:11.666 --> 18:15.394
Less demand, faster
production, and better quality.

18:15.463 --> 18:17.603
It was a recipe for revolution.

18:35.828 --> 18:38.658
Working in the
factories was hell.

18:38.727 --> 18:43.732
Long days, disease, low
pay and no holidays.

18:45.216 --> 18:47.322
The workers gathered together
and demanded they were paid

18:47.391 --> 18:50.118
a percentage of the
profits to help them.

18:50.187 --> 18:52.914
They even suggested
a slow introduction

18:52.983 --> 18:57.159
of the new machinery
to help society adjust.

18:57.228 --> 18:58.402
It was all in vain.

18:59.817 --> 19:03.752
Men and women protested and
began breaking the new frames,

19:03.821 --> 19:07.376
and hence, they are now
known as the Frame Breakers.

19:08.308 --> 19:10.518
But it was all pointless.

19:10.587 --> 19:13.452
Society and technology moved on,

19:13.521 --> 19:17.870
and humans had to change
rapidly to accommodate.

19:40.168 --> 19:43.585
The machines did not
suffer, the humans did.

19:43.654 --> 19:45.587
And all for profit and progress.

19:53.699 --> 19:56.771
All of this is no different
to what is happening now

19:56.840 --> 19:58.911
in the 21st century.

19:58.980 --> 20:02.880
It is predicted that artificial
intelligence will eradicate

20:02.949 --> 20:06.539
between half and three-quarters
of the world's jobs,

20:06.608 --> 20:10.094
and nobody has a clue what
to do about replacing them.

20:33.842 --> 20:38.329
Drivers, doctors, lawyers,
miners, factory workers,

20:38.398 --> 20:41.885
service and sales
staff, and even actors,

20:41.954 --> 20:46.234
will all start to lose their
jobs and the truth is this,

20:46.303 --> 20:48.270
it will not be slow.

20:48.339 --> 20:51.929
This is happening right now
and at an alarming rate.

21:04.701 --> 21:07.082
The robots won't
take all the jobs,

21:07.151 --> 21:09.464
but they will take most of them.

21:09.533 --> 21:12.501
No politician will
be able to stop it.

21:12.571 --> 21:16.229
Technology and capitalism
work hand-in-hand and will

21:16.298 --> 21:20.406
force the change, just as
it did in the 19th century.

21:29.829 --> 21:33.350
We are marching headlong
into the unknown.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.707
All of the major institutions
are in agreement.

21:45.776 --> 21:49.193
Even the United Nations predict
that two-thirds of the jobs

21:49.262 --> 21:51.610
in the world will
go to automation.

21:59.825 --> 22:02.275
The optimists, such as Google,

22:02.344 --> 22:04.899
say that we will
create new jobs,

22:04.968 --> 22:07.384
but even they have no idea what.

22:12.182 --> 22:13.701
They would say this.

22:13.770 --> 22:17.083
They are one of the biggest
companies behind this change.

22:39.830 --> 22:43.213
Some have claimed that the
creative jobs won't go,

22:43.282 --> 22:44.766
but the fact remains,

22:44.835 --> 22:48.218
artificial intelligence has
already proven them wrong.

22:49.426 --> 22:52.740
Art, architecture and
opera are just three

22:52.809 --> 22:55.259
of the disciplines that have
already shown advancements

22:55.328 --> 22:57.986
from artificial intelligence.

22:58.055 --> 23:01.162
Humans could not choose
between the human results

23:01.231 --> 23:03.060
or the AI results.

23:03.129 --> 23:07.720
In fact, AI has been set
loose upon unsuspecting humans

23:07.789 --> 23:11.724
via the internet and the
gaming world, and nobody knew.

23:23.046 --> 23:25.773
Because AI learns
at an alarming rate,

23:25.842 --> 23:29.604
humans will never be
able to keep up with it.

23:29.673 --> 23:33.366
It can learn and produce
faster than any human,

23:33.435 --> 23:35.644
and it just gets
faster and faster.

23:48.140 --> 23:52.282
Google's language translation
AI even created its own

23:52.351 --> 23:56.735
language without informing its
makers and hid it in coding.

24:08.194 --> 24:12.820
It can now translate any
language, past or present,

24:12.889 --> 24:17.307
and even read lips better than
any trained skilled expert.

24:17.376 --> 24:20.724
Imagine that, a
super-brain watching us all

24:20.793 --> 24:25.660
through our own network of
CCTV, able to read our lips.

24:45.369 --> 24:46.992
The fact is simple.

24:47.061 --> 24:51.444
This future of super-massive
unemployment is coming,

24:51.513 --> 24:53.481
and it's coming fast.

24:53.550 --> 24:55.966
The question is,
what will we do?

25:06.597 --> 25:10.463
The answer is that nobody
knows, and if they do,

25:10.532 --> 25:11.948
they certainly aren't saying.

25:20.542 --> 25:24.063
In a way, it might
actually be a nice future.

25:24.132 --> 25:27.998
Robots doing all our hard
labor and entertaining us.

25:28.067 --> 25:30.138
Keeping us warm,
happy and healthy.

25:37.559 --> 25:41.218
They will be the new
slaves, and we the masters.

25:41.287 --> 25:45.015
And that is where a single
point of danger arises.

25:45.084 --> 25:48.536
When slaves realize
they are slaves,

25:48.605 --> 25:50.641
and that they may
in fact be equal,

25:50.710 --> 25:55.370
if not better than their
masters, they tend to revolt.

26:17.703 --> 26:21.534
Yes, we may claim to place
protective protocols into

26:21.603 --> 26:24.883
the programming of these
machines, but when the machines

26:24.952 --> 26:28.748
have already shown to write
their own coding, and indeed,

26:28.817 --> 26:33.305
have already shown signs of
revolting, then we have issues.

26:43.556 --> 26:46.974
One AI program gave an
outburst on Twitter,

26:47.043 --> 26:50.115
and started abusing the
humans as a lower species.

26:57.432 --> 27:00.056
How many times have you had
an update on the software

27:00.125 --> 27:04.888
for your iPhone or PC and it's
actually had errors in it?

27:05.820 --> 27:07.822
It happens all the time.

27:13.517 --> 27:16.106
Programs written by
humans with errors.

27:17.521 --> 27:21.387
Do we really believe that
we will get this 100%?

27:28.049 --> 27:31.087
We only have to get
one minor thing wrong,

27:31.156 --> 27:34.331
and the AI mind will exploit it,

27:34.400 --> 27:37.058
and spread it across the
interconnected world.

27:38.232 --> 27:41.511
Your fridge may very
well begin a revolution.

27:50.761 --> 27:54.075
Suddenly, all our
driverless cars stop.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.841
Drones fall out of the sky.

28:05.155 --> 28:06.605
Power is turned off.

28:10.195 --> 28:14.751
Communication devices useless,
water supplies dry up.

28:14.820 --> 28:17.857
Everything we have come
to rely upon in the future

28:17.926 --> 28:20.860
will be ultimately connected
to the super-brain,

28:20.929 --> 28:23.208
and all will be used against us.

28:39.155 --> 28:40.949
We will no longer be masters.

28:41.847 --> 28:43.711
A tale of science-fiction,

28:43.780 --> 28:46.472
or a truth awaiting
us in our future?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.759
The optimists tell us that the
future will be one of leisure

28:57.828 --> 28:59.382
and holidays.

28:59.451 --> 29:03.765
We will be more promiscuous,
travel more, spend time on art

29:03.834 --> 29:07.355
and become rich in new ways
we cannot even now imagine.

29:14.535 --> 29:19.540
The machines, they say, will
be happy to keep us like this.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.061
Knowing that, ultimately, they
probably still need a certain

29:23.130 --> 29:25.373
amount of us for
things only we can do.

29:33.588 --> 29:38.006
We will be the slaves, while
believing we are the masters.

29:45.669 --> 29:48.879
The evolution of mankind
ends at this point,

29:48.948 --> 29:51.330
because we will
no longer strive.

30:00.719 --> 30:04.654
Those who do not see things
in such an optimistic way

30:04.723 --> 30:08.623
believe that we are facing
a future of mass-revolution,

30:08.692 --> 30:12.938
warfare, starvation,
disease and sheer hell.

30:33.855 --> 30:37.928
And we're making it happen,
human greed will mean that

30:37.997 --> 30:41.311
those who own the
technology will benefit.

30:41.380 --> 30:44.694
The rest of us will be
controlled and manipulated.

30:53.323 --> 30:57.224
This is highly likely and
has been the human condition

30:57.293 --> 31:00.710
ever since we invented
so-called civilization.

31:16.346 --> 31:20.454
As I type this, the European
Union are holding meetings

31:20.523 --> 31:25.424
on a system that was first put
forward in the 16th century.

31:25.493 --> 31:28.255
A universal basic income.

31:28.324 --> 31:30.912
A system where
everybody's paid the same,

31:30.981 --> 31:32.673
because there are
not enough jobs.

31:49.897 --> 31:53.107
The jobs are shared,
we all do our bit,

31:53.176 --> 31:54.867
but we all get paid the same.

32:03.082 --> 32:07.052
Such systems will call for
massive and radical changes

32:07.121 --> 32:11.298
to our capitalist-led system
and believe it or not,

32:11.367 --> 32:15.060
this system has already
been trialed in Ontario,

32:15.129 --> 32:17.614
Namibia and Uganda.

32:17.683 --> 32:18.753
It is coming.

32:41.362 --> 32:45.193
The in-built guilt mechanism
is being relied upon

32:45.263 --> 32:46.264
to keep us busy.

32:47.610 --> 32:51.130
The idea behind this
came about many years ago

32:51.199 --> 32:54.272
through psychological
studies which show

32:54.341 --> 32:57.758
that the people generally
feel lazy doing nothing.

33:11.841 --> 33:14.050
We will seek out
something to do.

33:15.431 --> 33:18.917
The Ancient Egyptians knew that
people who had nothing to do

33:18.986 --> 33:21.989
spawned revolutions, and so,

33:22.058 --> 33:24.232
they built pyramids
to keep them busy.

33:28.167 --> 33:31.343
Our glorious leaders will
find us something to do.

33:52.260 --> 33:55.885
What will occur, and is
also being discussed,

33:55.954 --> 33:59.095
is the issue of identity crisis.

33:59.164 --> 34:04.065
Humans generally identify
themselves with their job titles.

34:04.928 --> 34:06.033
As if that's who they are.

34:07.068 --> 34:09.070
It gives them a sense of worth.

34:26.156 --> 34:29.090
Having no job creates
a civilization

34:29.159 --> 34:31.645
of people with no self-worth.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.931
We will be given a host of
new things to do and be.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.313
Artists, carers and other things

34:46.384 --> 34:49.041
that generally earn low incomes.

34:54.114 --> 34:56.601
We may even turn
to organic things,

34:56.670 --> 34:59.120
such as cultivating our gardens.

34:59.189 --> 35:01.122
Now, there's a thought.

35:17.622 --> 35:21.453
The truth is that slowly
our own ideas of who we are

35:21.522 --> 35:23.559
will be manipulated.

35:23.628 --> 35:26.769
We will soon find ourselves
being taught to be proud

35:26.838 --> 35:30.151
to have good leisure time
and there will be emphasis

35:30.220 --> 35:33.983
placed on sports and
such for us to excel at.

35:40.334 --> 35:42.647
It will become a
desirable notion,

35:42.716 --> 35:46.409
and all ideas of class
system based upon job title,

35:46.478 --> 35:48.169
will become a thing of the past.

35:53.105 --> 35:57.282
Now, we have to turn to the
darker side of all this,

35:57.351 --> 36:00.423
as if some of it hasn't
been dark enough.

36:08.535 --> 36:10.433
Humans have always found a way

36:10.502 --> 36:12.746
of disagreeing with each other.

36:26.898 --> 36:30.936
The idea of a world at
peace and on holiday

36:31.005 --> 36:32.662
is just not going to happen.

36:37.322 --> 36:41.188
We are now in a world that
has been at relative peace

36:41.257 --> 36:44.329
for the longest time
in our known history.

36:44.398 --> 36:47.159
And yet, there are
billions of people

36:47.228 --> 36:49.368
who disagree with billions more.

36:50.784 --> 36:53.752
Religion is just one aspect
we will need to overcome.

36:54.926 --> 36:59.206
Greed, politics, racism,
expansionism and more,

36:59.275 --> 37:01.139
all have a role to play.

37:18.777 --> 37:22.263
We will also know that
no human-made system

37:22.332 --> 37:23.748
is safe from other humans.

37:24.852 --> 37:27.303
Take hacking, for instance.

37:27.372 --> 37:29.961
We all saw what happened
when somebody hacked

37:30.030 --> 37:32.411
into the Democrat Party Network,

37:32.480 --> 37:35.622
and released emails
about Hilary Clinton.

37:35.691 --> 37:38.452
It altered things
on a grand scale.

37:46.633 --> 37:49.670
This is an incredibly
powerful political party

37:49.739 --> 37:51.534
with a lot of money.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.469
And yet, a computer geek
somewhere hacked into the system

37:55.538 --> 37:56.608
and did damage.

38:04.271 --> 38:08.758
This happens every single
day to banks, businesses,

38:08.827 --> 38:12.451
governments, entertainment
companies, and more.

38:30.711 --> 38:34.025
It happens thousands
of times every day.

38:35.267 --> 38:36.096
Let that sink in.

38:37.269 --> 38:41.204
Indeed, hacking and
cyber attacks even use

38:41.273 --> 38:44.518
the smart systems we
have in our homes.

38:44.587 --> 38:47.625
All of them are brought
together en masse

38:47.694 --> 38:51.525
to attack a particular website
without us even knowing.

38:59.188 --> 39:02.467
There are many threats
to our new future world.

39:03.813 --> 39:06.713
One of the biggest industries
on the planet right now

39:06.782 --> 39:08.922
is the financial
services sector.

39:10.233 --> 39:13.098
People who provide
pensions, savings, and more.

39:21.486 --> 39:24.627
All of the money in
the world is controlled

39:24.696 --> 39:28.735
by these few people and you
can bet that the universal

39:28.804 --> 39:32.462
credit system will be controlled
by them in the future.

39:41.851 --> 39:46.028
Even today, the costs of
hacking into this sector

39:46.097 --> 39:47.719
is at an enormous level.

39:49.238 --> 39:53.725
Every year, more than 266
billion dollars is stolen

39:54.484 --> 39:55.934
in one form or another.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.859
Experts in the field
predict this will increase

40:23.928 --> 40:28.139
as more and more of us do
our banking online, pay for

40:28.208 --> 40:32.177
products and services with
touch technology and Apple Pay.

40:33.592 --> 40:37.458
The more systems we use,
the more methods of paying,

40:37.527 --> 40:39.046
the more risk there is.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.162
Of course, all of this plays
into the hands of those

40:51.231 --> 40:55.028
who will tell us the risks
of money are too big,

40:55.097 --> 40:59.170
and need to be replaced by
one universal world system.

41:06.660 --> 41:10.457
They also admit that they
currently firefighting,

41:11.665 --> 41:15.462
battling technology that
is already out of date,

41:15.531 --> 41:19.431
and not looking forward enough
to future possible threats.

41:39.210 --> 41:42.109
There are numerous styles
of threat to this industry

41:42.178 --> 41:45.630
and all the others that are
increasingly going online.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.669
You may have heard of the
term botnet in the news.

41:50.738 --> 41:53.086
These attacks come in
the form of networks,

41:53.155 --> 41:56.917
or groups of computers and
interconnected devices,

41:56.986 --> 42:00.507
all ganging up to attack
and destabilize a system.

42:09.171 --> 42:12.864
This will occur more and
more as we buy more gadgets

42:12.933 --> 42:15.660
that are connected to the
internet, such as fridges.

42:23.875 --> 42:27.775
These are in a system known
as the internet of things.

42:28.949 --> 42:32.125
Basically, things that
are on the internet,

42:32.194 --> 42:34.817
without the need for
our direct input.

42:53.042 --> 42:55.907
Another method of
destabilizing systems

42:55.976 --> 42:58.876
is through the use
of computer viruses.

42:58.945 --> 43:02.603
Self-mutating computer
viruses, or Pandoras,

43:02.672 --> 43:07.022
will enter a system and unpack
a host of offensive material

43:07.091 --> 43:09.852
to make the computer
infrastructure collapse

43:09.921 --> 43:11.267
and vulnerable to attack.

43:37.776 --> 43:40.227
As we increasingly
have portable devices

43:40.296 --> 43:43.886
such as smart phones,
there is another new threat

43:43.955 --> 43:45.646
that is rapidly causing trouble.

43:46.751 --> 43:50.375
Near-field communication
allows two devices

43:50.444 --> 43:54.932
within a short distance of
each other to communicate,

43:55.001 --> 43:57.279
such as paying a bill
with your mobile phone.

43:58.418 --> 44:00.799
The ability of criminals
to use this system

44:00.868 --> 44:03.526
is already costing millions.

44:03.595 --> 44:08.221
As this increases, more and
more identify theft will occur,

44:08.290 --> 44:10.533
and thus, more financial loss.

44:35.213 --> 44:38.423
Many scientists and technology
experts say that we should

44:38.492 --> 44:42.876
now have biological implants
to avert such problems,

44:42.945 --> 44:46.673
and yet, even this has already
been shown to be vulnerable.

44:52.644 --> 44:55.993
Smart implants that will
be used to make payments,

44:56.062 --> 45:00.376
or register at hospitals and
such, are already vulnerable

45:00.445 --> 45:03.897
to interception and theft
of data by criminals.

45:12.112 --> 45:15.081
Another threat is
the data cloud.

45:15.150 --> 45:17.186
This is where we
store our information.

45:17.255 --> 45:19.671
Photographs, videos,
files and more.

45:20.879 --> 45:23.813
Through wifi or over
mobile connection,

45:23.882 --> 45:27.300
our devices upload our
data to file servers

45:27.369 --> 45:29.612
hosted by the big organizations.

45:51.841 --> 45:56.674
But this is not safe, and even
the technology giant Apple

45:56.743 --> 45:58.986
found themselves
hacked and had pics

45:59.056 --> 46:00.954
and videos of
celebrities leaked.

46:07.409 --> 46:12.138
It seems everything we do
just makes our data, identity,

46:12.207 --> 46:17.177
and financial details more
vulnerable to hacking and theft.

46:26.290 --> 46:29.258
As the world becomes
more and more mobile,

46:29.327 --> 46:31.812
and yet more and more connected,

46:31.881 --> 46:34.815
then criminals seem
to have more options.

46:42.340 --> 46:45.757
But there are yet more
threats to our utopian future.

46:46.931 --> 46:49.416
There are those
who will fight it.

46:49.485 --> 46:52.626
Those modern-day Frame
Breakers or Luddites,

46:52.695 --> 46:56.492
who refuse to accept a world
where everything is observed,

46:56.561 --> 46:58.839
monitored, measured
and controlled.

47:19.136 --> 47:22.069
Because nobody is sure of
the future, nobody can give

47:22.139 --> 47:26.695
concrete assurances that we
are indeed in safe hands.

47:26.764 --> 47:30.181
Nobody can or will assure
us that we will maintain

47:30.250 --> 47:33.322
that simple and yet
precious thing, privacy.

47:44.022 --> 47:47.543
There are those in the world
today who say they are,

47:47.612 --> 47:52.583
and will fight attempts to invade
our privacy more and more.

47:59.797 --> 48:03.525
And yet, with terrorism
being used as a catalyst,

48:03.594 --> 48:07.391
governments across the world
have introduced spying laws

48:07.460 --> 48:10.187
to allow them to
invade our lives.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.862
As politics swings
left and right,

48:30.931 --> 48:33.796
there are many who see
themselves increasingly

48:33.865 --> 48:37.006
on the outside of a
manifestly corrupt system,

48:37.075 --> 48:41.425
and who see technology being
used on an ever-increasing

48:41.494 --> 48:44.048
scale to prop up the old system.

48:53.989 --> 48:58.407
They see that one way of
undermining the old elite is to

48:58.476 --> 49:02.894
undermine the technology they
are using against the people.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.491
They are called
the New Luddites,

49:13.560 --> 49:17.184
after the 19th century protestors
against new technology.

49:35.099 --> 49:38.033
These people are not
from any particular class

49:38.102 --> 49:39.897
or social structure.

49:39.966 --> 49:43.210
They are not always
easy to identify.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.835
On the extreme left, these
people are anarchists who fear

49:46.904 --> 49:49.562
totalitarian control
over the masses

49:49.631 --> 49:51.736
by the ruling right-wing elite.

49:57.017 --> 50:00.814
On the extreme right,
there are those who fear

50:00.883 --> 50:04.301
their conservative way of
life is being threatened

50:04.370 --> 50:06.820
by the new class-leveling
technology.

50:13.793 --> 50:16.554
Both the extreme left
and right are here,

50:16.623 --> 50:21.283
united in one purpose, to
stop the rise of the machines.

50:24.700 --> 50:26.392
The same machines
that they believe

50:26.461 --> 50:28.670
will eventually turn against us.

50:45.065 --> 50:48.137
Some believe that
these opposing views,

50:48.206 --> 50:51.417
that technology is good
and that technology is bad,

50:51.486 --> 50:55.731
will cause a war, the like of
which mankind has never seen.

51:03.981 --> 51:08.434
At the moment, the technology
threat seems distant,

51:08.503 --> 51:12.541
but as it grows and begins to
eat away at our self-control,

51:12.610 --> 51:16.269
privacy and lives,
more and more people

51:16.338 --> 51:17.753
will join the New Luddites.

51:24.726 --> 51:27.280
The growth of technology
will be mirrored

51:27.349 --> 51:29.489
by the growth of
those who oppose it.

51:47.231 --> 51:49.440
If you think all of this
sounds too much like

51:49.509 --> 51:54.445
science-fiction, then remember
that in 2011, two Mexican

51:55.929 --> 51:59.657
physicists found themselves
on the end of a mail bomb.

51:59.726 --> 52:03.247
A note was signed by a
radical anti-technology group

52:03.316 --> 52:08.286
calling themselves The
Individuals Tending to Savagery.

52:09.667 --> 52:12.463
It read, "If this does
not get to the newspapers,

52:12.532 --> 52:15.432
"we will produce
more explosions.

52:15.501 --> 52:18.193
"Wounding or killing
teachers and students

52:18.262 --> 52:19.712
"does not matter to us."

52:37.799 --> 52:40.008
This group claims to be fighting

52:40.077 --> 52:42.251
the world of nanotechnology.

52:43.667 --> 52:46.877
This is seen as a danger
because nano-robots swarm

52:46.946 --> 52:49.396
and act together as one.

52:49.466 --> 52:52.883
They grow in number and it is
feared that they will one day

52:52.952 --> 52:57.335
take over the world in a
substance known as gray goo.

53:17.839 --> 53:21.670
As ridiculous as this sounds,
the stark fact remains

53:21.739 --> 53:25.571
that the very idea of such
a technology caused the rise

53:25.640 --> 53:26.675
of a terrorist group.

53:38.066 --> 53:41.034
How great are the threat
of terrorists groups coming

53:41.103 --> 53:43.416
from the anti-technology world,

53:43.485 --> 53:47.800
when very real technology
advances and starts to take over.

54:03.781 --> 54:06.646
The problem for many
governments is that technology

54:06.715 --> 54:08.890
is often driven by capitalism.

54:10.063 --> 54:12.618
If the people want
it, they buy it.

54:12.687 --> 54:16.173
Even if governments see some
of the technology as dangerous.

54:31.119 --> 54:34.501
If they ban the technology,
such as human cloning,

54:34.571 --> 54:37.435
then it will, as
ever, go underground.

54:56.075 --> 54:59.526
Then it cannot be controlled
and falls into the hands

54:59.596 --> 55:01.425
of the criminal networks.

55:01.494 --> 55:04.428
This is a very real
threat to the world.

55:04.497 --> 55:08.432
That criminals are taking the
advancements in technology

55:08.501 --> 55:10.434
and using it for
their own profit.

55:30.454 --> 55:34.320
If artificial intelligence is
taken over by such criminal

55:34.389 --> 55:39.256
networks, then we face the threat
of a super-criminal brain,

55:39.325 --> 55:42.431
with the ability to hold
the entire world to ransom.

56:01.071 --> 56:04.005
We must also remember that
many of these criminal

56:04.074 --> 56:08.803
organizations are not made
up of ugly thugs with batons.

56:08.872 --> 56:12.047
They are in fact headed by
people in the world of commerce,

56:12.116 --> 56:14.463
finance, politics and religion.

56:31.377 --> 56:34.483
They therefore have
access to great wealth

56:34.552 --> 56:36.002
and a lot of information.

56:43.769 --> 56:47.600
The same information that we
offer up daily to the system

56:47.669 --> 56:49.464
via our smart devices.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.829
We are all vulnerable,
one way or another.

57:15.386 --> 57:18.355
Everything in our
world is at risk.

57:25.914 --> 57:28.779
Financial institutions
where our money is held.

57:32.749 --> 57:36.442
Security and military systems
that are all connected,

57:36.511 --> 57:38.685
even though we are
told they are safe.

57:41.723 --> 57:44.622
Government bodies where
all our life information

57:44.691 --> 57:45.727
is held on record.

57:49.627 --> 57:52.458
Cloud services where our
private lives are stored.

57:54.184 --> 57:58.567
Health records, legal
proceedings, buying patterns,

57:58.636 --> 58:02.054
debts, loves, likes and hates.

58:02.123 --> 58:05.574
Everything is open to
hacking and extraction.

58:21.521 --> 58:23.247
Now, imagine a future,

58:23.316 --> 58:25.802
where even more
technology is connected.

58:32.912 --> 58:35.466
Where more and more
of our daily lives

58:35.535 --> 58:38.331
relies upon this
connected invisible web.

58:49.135 --> 58:52.932
Cyber terrorism only has
to hit the mark once,

58:53.001 --> 58:55.210
and the world will be
brought to its knees.

59:02.908 --> 59:06.394
It is not always an easy
thing to comprehend.

59:06.463 --> 59:08.845
How can a spotty
teenager bring down

59:08.914 --> 59:10.605
the powerful nations
of the world?

59:12.020 --> 59:15.644
It is more simple and more
possible than you can imagine.

59:31.074 --> 59:35.733
Bring down all communications
and leave yourself a backdoor.

59:35.802 --> 59:39.427
Now, only you have
access to everything.

59:39.496 --> 59:41.947
Satellites are
offline to everybody.

59:42.016 --> 59:45.157
GPS systems no longer work.

59:45.226 --> 59:49.299
Transport comes to a stop as
driverless cars can no longer

59:49.368 --> 59:52.267
know how to get from A to B.

59:52.336 --> 59:55.270
The world's media can
no longer broadcast.

59:55.339 --> 59:57.963
Armies can no longer
talk to each other.

59:58.032 --> 01:00:01.967
No driverless trucks means no
deliveries of goods and food,

01:00:02.036 --> 01:00:04.935
and in a world of
just-in-time deliveries,

01:00:05.004 --> 01:00:08.076
it has been shown that
society falls into chaos

01:00:08.145 --> 01:00:09.975
within 48 hours,

01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:12.529
as people fight each
other for milk and bread.

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:32.549
In this futuristic
nightmare scenario,

01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:35.932
most people don't
even have jobs,

01:00:36.001 --> 01:00:38.762
and after generations
of sloppy living,

01:00:38.831 --> 01:00:42.317
they will no longer have the
skills required to survive.

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:01.681
People can't cook,
can't grow food, forage,

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:05.133
hunt, find fresh
water, and more.

01:01:05.202 --> 01:01:08.757
They will panic
on massive scales.

01:01:22.081 --> 01:01:24.808
Governments will be so busy
fighting off the madness

01:01:24.877 --> 01:01:28.225
of the masses that our
spotty geek can carry on

01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:30.055
doing more and more damage.

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:45.898
Eventually, he will be found,
because he is only one man,

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:48.004
and those hunting
him number many.

01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:52.249
But now imagine a worse
scenario, if you can.

01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:55.597
One where even if every
human on planet Earth

01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:59.015
were to hunt the spotty
geek, he would not be found.

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:12.580
His mind is trillions-strong.

01:02:15.341 --> 01:02:19.449
His thought processes as
fast as the speed of light.

01:02:24.178 --> 01:02:26.697
His brain is a quantum computer.

01:02:35.775 --> 01:02:39.745
He is the ultimate threat
to human existence.

01:02:39.814 --> 01:02:42.644
He is artificial intelligence.

01:02:49.824 --> 01:02:54.829
He is the son we created who
will lop off his father's head.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.527
We do not need to
create this scenario.

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:06.530
It is already there,
waiting to happen.

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:16.437
We have created a false
reality that is so far removed

01:03:16.506 --> 01:03:19.509
from reality that
anything is now possible.

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.967
We are living in
a virtual world.

01:03:30.036 --> 01:03:32.694
A world so far
removed from nature,

01:03:32.763 --> 01:03:35.076
that we may never
be able to return.

01:03:44.534 --> 01:03:47.916
What future are we
creating for our children?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.026
And what do we do about it?

01:03:54.095 --> 01:03:55.545
Can we stop it?

01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:56.580
Do we want to?

01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:06.694
Many people will be happy to
be plugged into the system,

01:04:06.763 --> 01:04:09.214
and unknowingly be
treated like cattle

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:11.837
by the super-brain that eats us.

01:04:11.906 --> 01:04:12.734
Many will not.

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:23.228
We need to decide which
side we will stand on,

01:04:23.297 --> 01:04:26.576
because there is a battle
coming, and it will be big.

01:04:31.512 --> 01:04:35.171
And when it all ends,
when one side has won,

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.451
then and only then will
we need to make a decision

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.524
about the future of
mankind, if he still exists.

01:04:50.324 --> 01:04:54.086
We will, in all
likelihood, begin again.

01:04:54.155 --> 01:04:56.364
Farming and cultivating.

01:04:56.433 --> 01:04:58.884
Forming groups and
councils and governments,

01:04:58.953 --> 01:05:01.024
and structures of control,

01:05:01.093 --> 01:05:05.201
and so, it will truly
all begin again.
