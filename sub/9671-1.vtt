01:27.520 --> 01:30.421
<i>Ow!</i>

01:34.027 --> 01:36.860
<i>Oh, murder.!
Oh, murder.!</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:40.866
Murder! Help!
A man's gettin' murdered!

01:40.934 --> 01:44.426
<i>Murder.! Help.! Help.!</i>

01:44.504 --> 01:46.529
Help!

02:20.607 --> 02:23.405
It's Calver Weems!
He's dead!

02:23.476 --> 02:26.502
He's been murdered! Oh,
don't panic! Don't panic!

02:26.579 --> 02:28.911
Oh, Luther, Luther,
it was terrible!

02:28.982 --> 02:31.507
He was walking along
the street, when bang!

02:31.584 --> 02:33.347
Right on the head.
With that.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.353
Did you see who did it? No.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.185
It was just bang! Right
on the head! With that!

02:38.258 --> 02:40.158
I'll get a picture
of it. Let's see.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.888
F-32. And it's dark.
It's been raining.

02:42.962 --> 02:47.126
And... Oh, for heaven sakes, stand back,
Susanna! Stand back! Get out of the way!

02:47.200 --> 02:50.226
And for heaven sakes, don't touch
anything. This is all evidence.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.828
He was just walking down
the street, when bang!

02:52.906 --> 02:55.773
Right on the head! All right. I'll
get a picture of the murder weapon.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.935
Bang!
Right on the head!

02:58.011 --> 03:00.673
I was just getting ready to brush
my teeth and watch Lawrence Welk,

03:00.747 --> 03:02.942
when I looked out
the window and bang!

03:03.016 --> 03:05.246
For heaven sakes, Susanna!
Pull yourself together!

03:05.318 --> 03:08.287
I'm going to the police station. You
get on the phone and call my editor.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.288
Who?
George Beckett!

03:10.356 --> 03:13.154
Tell him to get down to the
police station as soon as possible.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.888
And for heaven sakes, whatever
you do, keep your head!

03:15.962 --> 03:18.157
I don't want to
stay here by myself!

03:18.231 --> 03:21.428
Well, I told you to get on
the phone and call my editor!

03:21.501 --> 03:23.696
Now, go on!

03:23.770 --> 03:25.761
Aah!

03:39.886 --> 03:42.684
Hey, Heggs.
Wait a minute.

03:42.755 --> 03:45.815
Ollie, what are you doin' here? The
price tag on your suit's hangin' out.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.918
That's my press card, and you
know it. Beckett called. What's up?

03:48.995 --> 03:50.929
I got a story!
That's what's up!

03:50.997 --> 03:53.465
You just sit tight. If there's
a story, I'll handle it.

03:53.533 --> 03:57.560
Chief! You'd better get somebody out
to the old Simmons mansion right away!

03:57.637 --> 04:00.003
A terrible thing happened! I
got the pictures and everything!

04:00.073 --> 04:04.009
I was coming down the street... Now,
wait a minute, Luther. Just calm down.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.637
Give it to me nice and slow.
I was comin' down the street...

04:06.713 --> 04:08.874
Too fast.
Yeah, cool it, sport.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.109
What happened, Luther? Well,
I was comin' down the street...

04:11.184 --> 04:13.311
What's up? Oh, Mr. Beckett, I'm glad...

04:13.386 --> 04:17.048
I got this call from Susanna Blush:
two-by-fours, Calver Weems, Lawrence Welk...

04:17.123 --> 04:20.422
I'm glad you're here. I got a real
scoop... pictures and everything.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.929
I've been trying to get the story from
Walter Cronkite here, but he just won't give.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.194
- What's this all about?
- I don't know. He's so keyed up.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.930
- Will somebody listen to me?
- All right, Luther. Just calm down.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.404
Calm? Calm?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.441
Do "murder" and "calm"
go together?

04:35.508 --> 04:38.443
"Calm" and "murder"?
"Murder"?

04:38.511 --> 04:40.945
Murder?
Murder!

04:41.014 --> 04:43.005
Well, all right, Luther.
Let's hear it.

04:43.082 --> 04:46.279
All right! Well, I was out
on Warren Harding Road...

04:46.352 --> 04:49.321
and I passed the Simmons mansion when
all of a sudden I heard this scream...

04:49.389 --> 04:51.323
"Help! Help! Murder!"
Murder?

04:51.391 --> 04:53.689
Yeah, murder. Quick as a flash,
I whipped my Edsel around,

04:53.760 --> 04:56.320
I sped back to the scene of
the crime, got out of the car...

04:56.396 --> 04:58.330
and there it was.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.889
Do I have to tell you how I
felt when I saw it laying there?

05:00.967 --> 05:04.562
Saw what? The dead body of Calver Weems.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.696
He'd been bludgeoned
to death by a board.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.502
I'd better get somebody
out there right away.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.975
Did you see that happen? No, Susanna
Blush saw it. She's an eyewitness.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.537
- Susanna Blush.
- Yeah. Lives across the street. An eyewitness.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.778
Was she on the street? No, she saw it from
an upstairs window. Eyewitness, though.

05:18.851 --> 05:21.547
You said that, sonny. Did
you get pictures of the body?

05:21.621 --> 05:23.680
Left, right, profile, head-on. Fine, fine.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.224
<i>You actually saw
the murder weapon, Luther?</i>

05:26.292 --> 05:28.226
Yeah, a two-by-four.
I got a picture of it.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.489
Two-by-four?
Yeah! What's up?

05:30.563 --> 05:34.397
Don't bother us now, Calver.
We got a murder on our ha...

05:34.467 --> 05:36.401
Calver!

05:36.469 --> 05:39.734
Calver, what are you
doing here? You're dead!

05:39.806 --> 05:42.707
I knew it. I knew it.
I'm sorry, Chief.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.005
But... I saw you
layin' there...

05:45.078 --> 05:47.911
I want this drunk
thrown in the tank.

05:47.980 --> 05:52.417
Throw me in the tank? She's the one
that hit me! With a board that thick!

05:52.485 --> 05:54.612
What are you tryin' to do?
Make a fool out of me?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.918
You don't need much help,
scoop. Put him in number three.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.958
But you're dead!
I am not.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.618
I saw ya! I did too! You did not!

06:01.694 --> 06:02.718
You didn't. Didn't! Did! Did!

06:02.795 --> 06:04.729
Didn't! Didn't! Didn't!
Did! Did! Did!

06:04.797 --> 06:07.265
All right, you two.
That's enough.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.530
Come on, loved one.
But...

06:14.340 --> 06:16.604
But I got the pictures
and everything.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.610
Luther, from now on,

06:18.678 --> 06:21.078
let Ollie and me run the
paper and write the stories.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.445
You just keep
setting the type. Hmm?

06:23.516 --> 06:26.417
But I was sure...
Good night, Luther.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.750
Nice work... scoop.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.380
Scoop!
Yeah.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.781
Calver looked so natural! I got
to get a new suit for the funeral.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.480
Wonder who done him in? I can't wait
to read the morning paper and find out.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.489
All right, you two guys.
You just better watch it.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.616
You see these two hands?
They're just as hard as steel.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.991
Hey, look at him, Billy Ray. He's a
karate champion. We better watch ourselves.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.259
Go ahead, Luth.
Yeah, do something.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.132
Why don't you run up
an alley and holler "fish"?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.950
Wait. Then, all of a sudden,
in walks Calver Weems.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.683
<i>And Luther says to him,
"Cal, what are you doing here?</i>

07:37.757 --> 07:39.850
<i>You're dead.!"</i>

07:41.594 --> 07:45.052
We shouldn't laugh.
We really shouldn't.

07:45.131 --> 07:50.398
<i>You know, he took a close-up of a
two-by-four. Can you imagine that?</i>

07:54.707 --> 07:56.902
Morning, everybody.
Good morning, Luther.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.967
Morning, scoop.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.146
A person is never dead until
their pulse is stopped, Luther.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.846
Mr. Ace Reporter, would you
pass the marmalade, please?

08:10.122 --> 08:12.056
Lay off,
will ya, Ollie?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.751
Oh, now, Ollie,
enough is enough.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.523
I don't blame Luther
one iota.

08:17.597 --> 08:22.500
If I'd seen someone laying in front of that
spooky place, I'd think he was dead too.

08:22.568 --> 08:26.561
It's a murder house. I
wouldn't go near there for $100.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.573
I wouldn't go
near there for 200.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.575
Three hundred.
Four.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.577
Five.
Six.

08:32.645 --> 08:36.513
<i>Girls, girls, please.
Anyway, it's a murder house.</i>

08:36.582 --> 08:40.518
Murder and suicide.
Murder and suicide.

08:40.586 --> 08:44.181
Well, thank the good Lord they're
finally tearing that place down.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.316
Tearing it down?
Mm-hmm.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.758
Ephraigm Simmons's nephew
came to town two days ago.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.762
Nicholas!
Nick!

08:50.830 --> 08:53.799
Anyway, he's finally getting
the will probated.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.061
I hear he's gonna
bulldoze it to the ground.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.365
Didn't they question him
about that murder at the time?

08:58.437 --> 09:00.803
Mm-hmm.
He was cleared.

09:00.873 --> 09:05.071
I never liked his eyes.
So dark.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.908
His eyes were blue.
Dark eyes.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.005
Girls, really.

09:10.082 --> 09:13.279
All the Simmonses
had the Simmons eyes.

09:19.959 --> 09:23.326
Oh. It's Alma, Ollie.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.593
Tell her I'll be
right out.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.003
- Good morning, Alma.
- Oh, good morning, Mrs. Miller!

09:31.070 --> 09:34.403
He's still eating, Alma. Why
don't you come in for some coffee?

09:34.473 --> 09:37.271
Oh, no, thank you. I'll just
stay out here and get some sun.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.743
Oh. As you wish, dear.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.508
Ooh! Love that print!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.573
Thank you.
I got it at Belson's.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.845
Three ninety-five.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.116
She's an awful sweet girl.
Yeah, she's a good kid.

09:50.189 --> 09:53.283
My niece Malva bought
a print at Belson's.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.793
It was red, and had
yellow flowers...

09:55.861 --> 09:58.352
across the...
the bosoms.

10:00.633 --> 10:04.467
Uh... Would you excuse
me for just a minute?

10:06.472 --> 10:09.305
You know,
I'll never understand...

10:09.375 --> 10:12.572
why old Mr. Simmons
murdered his wife.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.079
Everyone knows
Ephraigm was crazy.

10:15.147 --> 10:18.548
They all had cold eyes
with thin lids.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.677
<i>Toast, please, Ollie.</i>

10:20.753 --> 10:22.687
Mmm, sure.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.335
Hi, Luther!
Oh! Hi, Alma.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.337
I didn't hear you
come up.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.600
Oh, well, I was just, uh...

10:41.674 --> 10:44.302
Uh... How you doin'?

10:44.377 --> 10:48.006
Fine. I just love
the sun, don't you?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.207
Oh, yeah. Yeah, l...

10:50.282 --> 10:53.046
I've always
liked the sun.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.489
- Love your print.
- Oh, thank you.

11:01.127 --> 11:04.961
Mrs. Cobb's niece Malva bought
a print down at Belson's.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.499
It's red with yellow flowers
across the...

11:11.904 --> 11:15.067
Ooh! Boy, that sun really
beats down on a...

11:15.141 --> 11:17.405
Hi, Ollie!
metal car.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.570
Good morning, Sugar. Boy,
you look like a million bucks.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.774
Thank you!

11:23.849 --> 11:28.081
Oh, Luther. Calver Weems said
not to tell anybody he's dead...

11:28.154 --> 11:30.418
<i>until he says so.</i>

11:44.837 --> 11:47.829
Oh, good morning, Bill.
Good morning.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.202
Oh, good morning,
Eileen.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.871
My, oh, my,
what a lovely sweater.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.813
You know, of all your sweaters,
I love this one the most.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.850
Mr. Simmons is waiting,
Mr. Maxwell.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.409
Hmm?
Oh, oh, yes.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.854
Good morning, Nicholas. Oh,
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.620
But we had a seance
at the house last night,

12:07.693 --> 12:10.560
and it ran on
until all hours.

12:10.629 --> 12:13.792
It was a surprise seance for Mrs.
Maxwell. Her birthday, you know.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.891
Don't tell me you believe
in that sort of thing, Milo.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.903
Well, it means the world
and all to Mrs. Maxwell.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.303
Did you sign the papers?
Is the title clear?

12:21.373 --> 12:23.671
The title?
Uh, the papers?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.870
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, the house.
Yes, the house.

12:25.945 --> 12:29.244
Well, uh, no, no.
As a matter of fact, no.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.478
But, uh, Delroy Flemming promises
to sign the quick deed today.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.645
- That'll be it, then?
- Well, I sign after,

12:35.721 --> 12:37.655
then that should
finalize it.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.021
I can get my bulldozers
in on Monday, then.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.994
Well, now, I don't understand that,
Nicholas. Why bulldoze it down?

12:44.063 --> 12:47.931
If you took it down piece by piece, you
could sell some of that beautiful woodwork.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.333
Your uncle imported all that hand-carved
work. That must be worth a fortune.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.598
I haven't the time. I've
got to get back to Chicago.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.833
Now, you're sure that I
can start on Monday, then?

12:55.908 --> 12:59.935
Well, l... I foresee no
problems, Nicholas. Good.

13:03.482 --> 13:07.111
I don't know. You try and you try
and you try, and what do you get?

13:07.186 --> 13:09.518
Heartaches! Now wait a minute, Luther.

13:09.588 --> 13:13.217
You didn't do so bad. Your
pictures turned out nice.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.193
You had a good murder story
going there.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.628
Only trouble was,
nobody got killed.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.494
Oh, Mr. Boob.
That's me.

13:20.566 --> 13:24.002
B-double-O-B...
boob!

13:24.069 --> 13:26.230
You know why you thought you
saw a murder out there, Luther?

13:26.305 --> 13:29.832
'Cause that's a murder house.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.475
Oh, they can't tear it down too
soon for me, I'll tell you that.

13:34.547 --> 13:38.574
- Tear it down? Who's tearing it down?
- Nick Simmons.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.211
But he can't do that
without the bank okaying it.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.313
He doesn't have clear title to that
property. The bank's got a lien on it.

13:44.390 --> 13:47.621
Well, I guess he's getting
all that cleared up.

13:47.693 --> 13:51.288
Oh. So he's back in town,
is he?

13:51.363 --> 13:53.593
That's what they say.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.124
Oh, Mr. News. I need a
three-inch item for a filler.

14:01.807 --> 14:03.798
"Mr. News."

14:07.213 --> 14:09.511
I'll fill him someday.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.883
So little Nick is finally
getting his way, eh?

14:14.954 --> 14:16.888
What did you say,
Mr. Kelsey?

14:16.956 --> 14:19.083
You know, Luther,

14:19.158 --> 14:21.854
I was working out there
at the time of the murder.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.918
Oh, really?
Yeah.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.464
I was the gardener.
Is that right?

14:26.532 --> 14:32.198
Young Mrs. Simmons was a
beautiful, beautiful woman.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.672
Sparkling black eyes
and skin like alabaster.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.710
The old man was crazy jealous.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.802
You know, Luther,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.281
it was just 20 years ago
this week...

14:44.350 --> 14:46.284
they were both
found dead.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.578
This week? They say what happened was this.

14:50.656 --> 14:53.454
The two of them was in
the master bedroom arguin'.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.688
He was in a jealous rage.
Suddenly he became violent.

14:56.762 --> 15:00.425
Stabbed her right in the throat.
They never did find out what with.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.399
Then he went
completely loco.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.869
He ran up into the tower,
blood dripping from his hands,

15:05.938 --> 15:09.601
and played that
pipe organ of his.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.667
It was midnight, Luther,
and he sat there...

15:12.745 --> 15:16.272
playin' and laughin' and
screamin' to beat the band.

15:16.348 --> 15:19.181
When the music
reached its peak,

15:19.251 --> 15:22.687
he suddenly jumped up and
threw himself out the window.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.585
They say the ghost
of old man Simmons...

15:27.660 --> 15:29.719
still climbs the tower...

15:29.795 --> 15:33.390
and plays the organ...
at midnight.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.399
<i>Luther.!
Aah!</i>

15:35.467 --> 15:37.697
<i>Let's have
that filler.!</i>

15:42.608 --> 15:46.066
Well, me, I just don't happen
to believe in ghosts...

15:46.145 --> 15:48.079
particularly.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.274
You know, Luther,
I got an idea...

15:50.349 --> 15:52.544
how you could write
a story for the paper.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.143
How?
That filler.

15:55.220 --> 15:59.657
I think folks'd be interested in
reading about the Simmons case again.

15:59.725 --> 16:03.252
It bein' the 20th
anniversary and all.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.264
You mean, write my own story
instead of using a standard filler?

16:06.332 --> 16:08.698
Sure.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.292
Do you think
I dare do that?

16:11.370 --> 16:13.395
'Course you do.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.633
You know why?
Huh?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.972
'Cause you got spunk.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.940
You... You know, I guess
I got that from my mother.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.449
She had
plenty of spunk.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.021
All right.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.080
Let's see.

16:34.827 --> 16:39.457
It was just, uh,
20 years ago...

16:39.531 --> 16:42.432
come this Tuesday...

16:42.501 --> 16:46.801
that the bodies of Mr. and
Mrs. Simmons were found.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.638
<i>Mr. Beckett.! Mr. Beckett.</i>

16:52.711 --> 16:55.441
Oh, hello, Mrs. Maxwell.
Oh, it's wonderful.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.709
The whole town's
talking about it.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.684
I mean, the article
on the Simmons mansion.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.687
Absolutely delicious.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.553
Well, thank you. I've had a
lot of nice comment about that.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.387
You know, my group and
I have always felt...

17:08.460 --> 17:12.396
there's a very active spirit
life in that old house.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.398
You mean, spooks?
Ohh!

17:15.467 --> 17:19.233
We prefer "manifestations."

17:19.304 --> 17:22.034
Well, keep up the good work.
I must run.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.843
Say, Ollie. Good reaction on that story
on the Simmons place. Do more on it.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.478
Do more? I haven't done anything on
it yet. Nick Simmons won't even see me.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.750
You mean,
you didn't write this?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.954
<i>No, this isn't mine.</i>

17:44.029 --> 17:47.157
My idea was the passing
of a landmark.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.666
Well, if you didn't write
it, and I didn't write it,

17:49.735 --> 17:52.397
who did?

17:56.341 --> 17:59.777
Um, do you know something
about this, Mr. Kelsey?

17:59.845 --> 18:04.305
Oh, what was that? I'm afraid I
wasn't following the conversation.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.613
Oh. This.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.619
Oh, the Luther Heggs story.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.848
Luther!

18:10.923 --> 18:13.619
I should have known
this was Luther's work.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.626
Here, get this.

18:15.694 --> 18:20.757
"The horribleness and the awfulness of
it will never actually be forgotten"?

18:23.469 --> 18:26.563
You know, tomorrow night
is the 20th anniversary...

18:26.638 --> 18:28.606
of the murder
and suicide.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.972
We ought to capitalize on it.
Do it with a fresh approach.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.410
I think somebody ought to spend
the anniversary night in the house.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.643
I've got an idea. I think somebody ought
to spend the anniversary night in the house.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.651
Hey, great! Leave it to me. I'll
get in a little before midnight...

18:40.719 --> 18:43.085
No, no.
Not you, Ollie.

18:43.155 --> 18:46.522
What we need is somebody
with a-a wild imagination.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.618
Someone who's a bit
of a coward.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.027
Someone who's
a-a little superstitious.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.066
<i>Luther, you all right?
I'm fine.</i>

18:55.134 --> 18:57.364
Luther! Of course!
But he can't write!

18:57.436 --> 18:59.370
You'll help him.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.870
Uh, Luther?
Oh, yes, sir?

19:07.946 --> 19:11.347
Congratulations on that
filler. It was a great story.

19:11.416 --> 19:15.284
Oh! Well, thank you. I-I
was hoping you wouldn't mind.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.254
We're gonna do
a, uh, follow-up.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.813
Front-page lead, and
you're going to write it.

19:22.127 --> 19:26.393
A... A byline for me?
Oh, for gosh sakes!

19:26.465 --> 19:31.027
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Oh, you ought to know better than to ask that, Chief.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.231
<i>The supernatural doesn't
bother you? Not a speck.</i>

19:34.306 --> 19:36.831
Uh, do haunted houses
scare you?

19:36.909 --> 19:39.275
They're mortar,
stone and wood.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.610
Well, good, because you're gonna spend
the murder night in the Simmons house.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.048
Alone.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.848
Oh, well, now...
Just a second.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.185
Uh... Uh... What's the
matter, Ace? You scared?

19:51.256 --> 19:53.656
Oh, well, heck, no.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.523
You kiddin'?
It's just that I, uh,

19:56.595 --> 19:59.621
got to check my bowling
schedule and everything.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.757
Oh, well,

20:01.833 --> 20:04.825
you think it over, Luther,
and let us know tomorrow.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.671
This is a great chance
for you, Luther.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.309
Oh, yeah.

20:20.385 --> 20:25.015
Why don't you go out there
tonight and just look it over?

20:25.090 --> 20:27.854
Yeah. Maybe
I'll do that.

20:27.926 --> 20:31.487
I mean, after all,
it's only mortar...

20:31.563 --> 20:35.733
Stone...

20:35.801 --> 20:37.792
And wood.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.362
And wood.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.016
Aah!

22:12.130 --> 22:14.257
Luther Heggs.
Nicholas Simmons.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.665
What are you
doing in front of my house?

22:18.270 --> 22:21.671
What are you asking for it? It's
not for sale. I'm tearing it down.

22:21.740 --> 22:26.643
Oh, well, I guess I'll
just have to... build.

22:40.659 --> 22:43.253
Luther! Hi.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.353
Oh, hi, Alma.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.921
Oh, you, you going
to lunch?

22:47.999 --> 22:50.024
No, just on my way in
to have lunch.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.229
Going to have lunch, huh?
Mm-hmm.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.363
Yeah, well...
What time is it?

22:54.439 --> 22:56.373
Hmm? Oh, uh, 12:00.

22:56.441 --> 23:00.104
Yeah, well, that's lunchtime,
all right. Yes, it is.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.742
Why don't we have lunch together? Oh, yeah!

23:04.816 --> 23:06.750
Okay.
Oh, first...

23:06.818 --> 23:08.843
I have to mail this
for Mr. Beckett right away.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.150
I'll get us a booth and order
for you. What would you like?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.384
Well...
Chicken noodle soup.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.723
Okay, fine.
See you in a minute.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.400
I'm having chicken noodle soup with Alma!

23:40.252 --> 23:42.186
Oh, well, this was
the only table left,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.245
but this gentleman
is just about finished.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.688
I'm almost up
to myJell-O.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.522
Oh. Oh, well...

23:57.502 --> 23:59.732
Did you happen to see
yesterday's paper?

23:59.805 --> 24:02.831
Mm-hmm. What did you think of it?

24:02.908 --> 24:06.776
What do you mean? The
story on the Simmons place.

24:06.845 --> 24:11.111
Oh, yes, I did see that. That was mine.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.378
Really?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.444
<i>Gee, I didn't know you were a reporter.
I thought you were just a typesetter.</i>

24:16.521 --> 24:19.388
Oh, well, no.
I am now,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.392
yeah, but, I mean,
that's just background.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.655
I'm working my way up. Oh, I see.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.361
I have a certificate from the
Kansas City Correspondence College...

24:28.433 --> 24:30.367
in journalism,
you know.

24:30.435 --> 24:33.165
Rafe Henderson came out
of there, you know. Oh.

24:33.238 --> 24:37.766
Who's Rafe Henderson? He's the one that
covered that famous dead whale story.

24:37.843 --> 24:41.540
You know, where that whale washed
up on the beach in San Francisco?

24:41.613 --> 24:44.275
Laid there for three weeks. Ugh.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.715
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.712
Oh.

24:55.193 --> 24:57.320
Thank you.
Uh, who gets the soup?

24:57.395 --> 24:59.659
Yours truly.
Oh.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.790
Just put it right there. Okay.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.803
Uh... can you manage?

25:05.871 --> 25:07.862
Oh, sure.

25:18.483 --> 25:21.213
Do you have any more
assignments?

25:22.387 --> 25:25.481
Well, as
a matter of fact,

25:25.557 --> 25:29.049
it's just possible that something
very big is about to break.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.097
Don't mention this
to anybody.

25:33.164 --> 25:36.224
I may do a follow-up on
the Simmons story. Ooh.

25:36.301 --> 25:39.134
They want me to spend
tonight in the Simmons house.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.798
It's the 20th anniversary of
their murder/suicide, you know.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.274
I know. Gee, that's
an exciting idea.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.903
You know, even though most people
say they don't believe in ghosts,

25:47.979 --> 25:51.244
it takes an awful lot of nerve to spend
the night in that spooky old place.

25:51.316 --> 25:53.307
Mmm. Spunk.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.548
Are you gonna do it?

25:59.224 --> 26:01.158
Well...

26:03.361 --> 26:05.727
Uh, aren't you through
with yourJell-O?

26:09.868 --> 26:12.132
Hi, baby. Sorry I couldn't
have lunch with you.

26:12.203 --> 26:15.036
Ollie, that's Luther's chair.
Oh, what's the word, Heggs?

26:15.106 --> 26:17.097
You gonna spend the night
in the house or aren't you?

26:17.175 --> 26:19.336
Well, l... I'm giving two
to one all over town...

26:19.411 --> 26:23.177
that you're not gonna do it, and I'm
not getting too many takers either.

26:25.016 --> 26:28.975
Well, I'll tell you something, Ollie. I'm
afraid you're gonna lose a lot of money!

26:29.054 --> 26:32.182
Because come 11:30 tonight,
I'll be there!

26:32.257 --> 26:34.589
Good-bye, Alma.
Put that on my tab.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.786
You haven't got
a tab.

26:50.308 --> 26:53.175
<i>Luther.</i>

26:53.244 --> 26:56.543
Mr. Deligondo is
getting you his flashlight.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.175
He'll, uh... He'll be here
in just a minute.

27:05.423 --> 27:08.654
I was only two blocks away
that awful night...

27:08.727 --> 27:10.661
at my sister Clara's.

27:10.729 --> 27:14.529
<i>We were sort oflistening
to the organ, you know.</i>

27:14.599 --> 27:19.127
The midnight bells
were ringing.

27:19.204 --> 27:22.196
I turned to Clara
and I said,

27:22.273 --> 27:24.207
"Clara,

27:24.275 --> 27:27.540
the organ music sounds
strange tonight."

27:30.048 --> 27:32.846
Well, what did
Clara say?

27:37.222 --> 27:39.156
She said,

27:39.224 --> 27:41.658
"Yes, it does."

27:43.828 --> 27:46.797
You know Clara.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.265
Well,

27:49.334 --> 27:53.464
they say there are still
bloodstains on the organ keys.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.472
That's right.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.442
They've never been able to get
them off. And they used Bon Ami.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.480
<i>Everybody says
he still comes there...</i>

28:02.547 --> 28:04.879
<i>and plays at midnight.</i>

28:06.551 --> 28:09.315
Doesn't play as well
as he used to.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.186
You mean, you've
heard him play?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.813
It's time
to go, Luther.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.283
Uh, yeah.

28:40.351 --> 28:43.445
Yeah, well, I'm gonna...
g-go over there now.

28:49.994 --> 28:53.191
Well, uh,

28:53.264 --> 28:56.062
I, uh, I guess
this is it.

28:58.503 --> 29:00.494
I'll s...

29:02.774 --> 29:05.368
Good-bye, Luther!

29:14.285 --> 29:17.618
Uh, well, I'll see you
in the morning.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.714
God willing.

29:46.584 --> 29:49.917
Ollie! I'm just putting your
adrenaline in shape, kid.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.957
Well, my adrenaline is
just fine, thank you.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.891
You're really going in there,
huh? Of course I'm going in there!

29:55.960 --> 29:58.360
What do you think I came out
here for? Not to go in there?

29:58.429 --> 30:00.795
Well, don't get
so excited, fella.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.096
Well, you know why I'm excited?
I'll tell you why I'm excited.

30:04.169 --> 30:07.400
Because of you! That's why I'm
excited. Oh, come on, Luther.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.066
You're scared and you know it. You
want me to go in there with you?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.541
No, I don't want you
to go in there with me.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.408
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't
you? Sharing all the glory.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.779
Well, for your information,
fella, I work single-o.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.875
Just me, myself and I.

30:20.952 --> 30:24.979
Okay, Ace. She's all yours. See you around.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.190
Ollie?

31:35.660 --> 31:37.924
Oh!

31:45.536 --> 31:48.801
<i>Rachel Courier Express.!</i>

31:56.414 --> 31:58.405
My flashlight.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.107
Big ghost.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.143
Boo.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.313
Mrs. Simmons.

36:59.116 --> 37:02.279
<i>Who's there?</i>

37:02.353 --> 37:05.049
Is that you, Ollie?

37:05.122 --> 37:08.250
Ollie, you...

37:08.326 --> 37:10.351
You trying to
scare me, Ollie?

37:16.534 --> 37:20.231
You in that other room there?

37:20.304 --> 37:22.238
You tryin' to scare me?

37:22.306 --> 37:25.207
Darn you guys!
I'll show you!

37:31.716 --> 37:34.549
Holy Toledo.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.198
Blood.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.587
It was terrible!
It was just terrible!

39:23.661 --> 39:25.686
Okay, now, Luther.
Tell us what happened.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.926
It was terrible! It was just
terrible! Oh, no! He's gonna cry!

39:28.999 --> 39:31.092
Now, steady, now, Luther.
Tell us about it.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.227
It was terrible!
It was just terrible!

39:33.304 --> 39:35.534
I'll never get over it
as long as I live!

39:35.606 --> 39:37.699
Hey, great
opening line. Uh,

39:37.775 --> 39:41.472
"I'll never get over it
as long as I live."

39:41.545 --> 39:43.479
Okay, Luther.
Go on.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.481
I got to house...
lightning, thunder...

39:45.549 --> 39:47.676
Swoosh, zoom!
Down coal chute!

39:47.752 --> 39:49.686
"I arrived
at the house.

39:49.754 --> 39:53.246
"Giving careful consideration to
the most advantageous means of entry,

39:53.324 --> 39:55.417
<i>I selected
the coal chute. "</i>

39:56.827 --> 39:59.694
"Once inside,
I had a look around,

39:59.764 --> 40:02.858
"then made myself comfortable
for the night.

40:02.933 --> 40:06.664
"Suddenly there was a
strange knocking on the wall.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.137
I remained cool."
I'll bet.

40:09.206 --> 40:14.234
"Moving swiftly, I found myself
in the organ loft.

40:14.311 --> 40:17.178
"There it was,
the massive organ...

40:17.248 --> 40:21.685
"shrouded in cobwebs, its
once-beautiful ivory keys...

40:21.752 --> 40:25.916
still covered with the stains
of young Mrs. Simmons's blood."

40:25.990 --> 40:27.924
And they used Bon Ami.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.894
"Later, I descended
to the first floor.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.453
"There, I was to see the most
horrifying display of all...

40:34.532 --> 40:36.693
"in this bloody
parade of terror.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.235
"The portrait of young Mrs. Simmons
had been stabbed in the throat...

40:39.303 --> 40:42.329
"with what appeared to be a pair
of gardeners' pruning shears."

40:42.406 --> 40:44.966
You've never seen
anything like it!

40:45.042 --> 40:47.272
I'll talk to you later. Hey, Al!

40:47.344 --> 40:50.404
Run off another 500.
They're selling like hotcakes.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.917
We've made some sort of hero out of Luther,
and that Simmons place is the talk of the town.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.975
Come on.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.968
I'm sorry, Mrs. Maxwell. Nicholas
Simmons gave me strict orders.

41:15.039 --> 41:17.200
No one's allowed
on this property.

41:17.274 --> 41:20.471
Mr. Fuller, you don't seem to
understand. We are followers.

41:20.544 --> 41:22.808
We're on the path
of the occult.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.348
I'm afraid you won't find
anything like that around here.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.010
Well, it's obvious
you don't understand.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.576
Our society
is dedicated...

41:30.654 --> 41:32.986
to contacting
the other world.

41:33.057 --> 41:36.356
The Communists?
The spiritual world.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.089
Mrs. Maxwell!
Mrs. Maxwell!

41:39.163 --> 41:41.529
The cosmic
vibrations!

41:41.599 --> 41:43.533
Coming, coming.

41:45.569 --> 41:49.528
Oh, the divine
emanations from it.

41:49.607 --> 41:52.872
Hail, cosmic chief.

41:52.943 --> 41:57.710
<i>Taro.! Caro.!
Salamond.!</i>

41:57.781 --> 42:00.011
All right, ladies.
Break it up.

42:00.084 --> 42:03.315
That's it for today. No
demonstrating without a permit.

42:03.387 --> 42:05.821
You have no right
to bar us from this house.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.586
I've got my orders. Then I'll
have those orders changed.

42:08.659 --> 42:11.150
Well, you'd better do it soon.
They're gonna tear it down Monday.

42:11.228 --> 42:13.389
Tear it down?

42:13.464 --> 42:16.627
By whose orders? Nicholas
Simmons, the owner.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.634
Are you sure?
Positive.

42:20.905 --> 42:24.636
This citadel of the divine,
destroyed?

42:24.708 --> 42:28.439
Never!

42:28.512 --> 42:31.037
Milo, look at me
when I talk to you.

42:31.115 --> 42:33.174
Halcyon, I promised
Nicholas Simmons...

42:33.250 --> 42:35.343
that I would clear the title
by the first of the week.

42:35.419 --> 42:37.649
Then you haven't signed
the final papers yet?

42:37.721 --> 42:40.087
Well, no. No, I haven't. Milo,

42:40.157 --> 42:44.491
do you realize how long it's been
since we've had a local manifestation?

42:44.562 --> 42:48.828
We always have to go out of town,
as far away as Wooster, Ohio.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.493
Oh, Halcyon... Now, don't
"Oh, Halcyon" me, Milo.

42:51.569 --> 42:55.665
You don't seem to realize
the cosmic importance of this.

42:55.739 --> 42:59.470
Why, this is bigger than the
whispering steeple in Kansas City.

42:59.543 --> 43:03.877
It's bigger than the headless
ballet dancer in Dublin, Ireland.

43:03.948 --> 43:06.610
And it's even bigger than
the day our dear Theresa...

43:06.684 --> 43:11.212
received that personal message
from Rudolph Valentino in Toledo.

43:11.288 --> 43:13.449
Milo, you will not
sign those papers.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.116
Oh, but dear...
You won't.

43:15.192 --> 43:16.523
But dear...
You won't.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.995
But... I own 51% of the bank stock.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.623
I won't.

43:27.871 --> 43:30.465
Milo, you didn't eat
your tapioca.

43:30.541 --> 43:33.339
No wonder you have
a nervous stomach.

43:41.518 --> 43:45.249
What kind of a man runs his
bank on the whims of his wife?

43:45.322 --> 43:47.916
Well, you just don't know
Mrs. Maxwell.

43:47.992 --> 43:50.222
In the name of heaven, man,
I've waited 20 years for this!

43:50.294 --> 43:53.821
Well, she owns 51% of the
bank's stock, for pete's sake.

43:53.897 --> 43:57.162
Don't tell me your wife believes
all that Luther Heggs hogwash!

43:57.234 --> 44:01.466
With all her heart. She came home
last night and vibrated for an hour.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.865
Let me get this straight.

44:04.942 --> 44:07.001
You mean, you're not
gonna sign the papers?

44:07.077 --> 44:10.012
Well, l... l...
I just can't, Nick.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.079
All right.
What are you going to do?

44:16.020 --> 44:17.954
When I get through
with Luther Heggs,

44:18.022 --> 44:20.252
nobody will believe him
when he says "Good morning."

44:45.516 --> 44:48.417
Where on earth
is Luther?

44:48.485 --> 44:50.544
He'll be late
for his own speech.

44:50.621 --> 44:55.183
Celebrities are never on
time. There's Alma. Hi, Alma!

44:55.259 --> 44:58.956
Hi, ladies.
Have you seen Ollie?

44:59.029 --> 45:01.554
I heard him say
he wasn't coming.

45:01.632 --> 45:04.931
I believe his nose is out of
joint on account of Luther.

45:05.002 --> 45:08.733
Oh! Here comes Luther!

45:20.951 --> 45:22.919
Hi, hi, hi.

45:22.986 --> 45:25.011
Hello. Hi. How are you?

45:27.391 --> 45:30.451
Hello. Hello.
Good to see you.

45:34.531 --> 45:36.499
Uh, hi!

45:39.303 --> 45:43.069
- Over here, Luther!
- Oh! Hi!

45:43.140 --> 45:46.439
How are ya?
How are ya?

45:46.510 --> 45:48.444
Mr. Mayor.

45:48.512 --> 45:51.447
All you people who aren't Chamber
of Commerce, clear the table area.

45:51.515 --> 45:56.145
Only C of C people here.
Come on. Clear the area.

45:56.220 --> 46:00.316
Clear the area. Oh, no. Not you, Mr.
Heggs. You stay right where you are.

46:00.390 --> 46:02.255
You too, miss.

46:02.326 --> 46:04.794
That's Alma Parker.

46:04.862 --> 46:07.888
I guess, um, being with you
makes me some sort of celebrity.

46:07.965 --> 46:10.297
Well...

46:10.367 --> 46:14.235
How are ya? Are you
alone? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

46:14.304 --> 46:16.966
Oh. Well...

46:17.040 --> 46:19.031
Can I have your autograph, Mr. Heggs?

46:19.109 --> 46:22.772
It's not for me.
It's for my father.

46:22.846 --> 46:26.145
Sure.
Autograph.

46:26.216 --> 46:28.582
There you go.
He's cute.

46:28.652 --> 46:31.018
Yeah.

46:31.088 --> 46:33.682
I get to feed
the speaker!

46:37.494 --> 46:40.292
That's Loretta Pine.
I know.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.070
I just love good food.
So do I.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.166
Do you?
Uh-huh.

46:53.243 --> 46:55.404
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.481
My mother liked good food. Oh.

47:00.551 --> 47:02.416
She always used to say,

47:02.486 --> 47:05.512
"I'd rather eat good food than
bad food any old day of the week."

47:13.463 --> 47:15.954
I guess we're having
lunch together again.

47:16.033 --> 47:19.025
Yes, we are.

47:22.773 --> 47:25.003
Would you like to have
lunch some evening?

47:25.075 --> 47:29.705
Oh, uh, that is to say, of
course, uh, that would be dinner.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.714
Well, l...
I-I understand.

47:31.782 --> 47:34.842
I understand. You and Ollie and everything.

47:34.918 --> 47:36.909
Not necessarily.

47:38.055 --> 47:41.388
Y-You mean,
you and Ollie aren't, uh...

47:41.458 --> 47:43.688
Not as much
as people think.

47:45.262 --> 47:47.253
Oh.

47:49.299 --> 47:52.234
Would you like to have
dinner Sunday night? Yeah.

47:52.302 --> 47:56.568
<i>Fine. You're okay. You're
C of C. You're okay.</i>

47:56.640 --> 47:59.234
You're C of C.
You're okay.

47:59.309 --> 48:02.278
You're not C of C,
but you're okay.

48:02.346 --> 48:07.639
You're C of C,
and you're okay.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.709
You're...

48:11.121 --> 48:13.646
You're not C of C.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.557
I'm Rotary.
Get out of here!

48:16.627 --> 48:19.095
Who are you
shovin' around, huh?

48:30.340 --> 48:33.070
Thank you, Billy
and Norma Jean Wexler.

48:33.143 --> 48:37.136
<i>And that concludes the
musical portion of our program.</i>

48:37.214 --> 48:39.705
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

48:39.783 --> 48:42.308
it is a great honor
and a privilege to present...

48:42.386 --> 48:45.787
the head of our Chamber of
Commerce and the mayor of our town,

48:45.856 --> 48:47.790
Carlyle Preston.

48:57.701 --> 49:00.033
Atta boy, Carl!

49:02.372 --> 49:07.036
My fellow citizens of Rachel.

49:08.645 --> 49:11.273
Well, the electrician
must be a Democrat.

49:13.183 --> 49:15.651
Atta boy, Carl.

49:15.719 --> 49:19.780
<i>Rachel has been humming
for the past few days,</i>

49:19.856 --> 49:22.518
and I really don't have to
tell you why.

49:22.592 --> 49:26.824
<i>There's been an old house
in this town for years...</i>

49:26.897 --> 49:28.888
that, if the truth
be known,

49:28.966 --> 49:31.958
folks have been afraid
to go near.

49:32.035 --> 49:35.732
<i>I know I have.</i>

49:35.806 --> 49:39.640
But one of our very own
had the pluck to go in.

49:39.710 --> 49:43.908
<i>And that name has been
on every tongue.</i>

49:43.981 --> 49:47.542
<i>And the name of that person
who's been on every tongue...</i>

49:47.617 --> 49:51.246
<i>is none other than... and I
really don't have to say it...</i>

49:51.321 --> 49:53.414
Luther Heggs!

50:29.292 --> 50:33.626
Thank you, Mayor,
and fellow Rachelanians.

50:44.141 --> 50:47.702
That electrician
must be a Democrat.

50:55.452 --> 50:57.682
Th...

50:57.754 --> 51:01.019
Thank you, M-Mayor,
and fellow Rachelanians.

51:01.091 --> 51:03.821
I am proud
to be here today.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.330
<i>Atta boy, Luther.</i>

51:08.965 --> 51:11.832
Uh, when I was
asked to be...

51:11.902 --> 51:14.632
guest speaker
at this luncheon,

51:14.704 --> 51:17.400
I asked myself this:

51:19.576 --> 51:21.510
"Who are you,
Luther Heggs,

51:21.578 --> 51:26.447
to be a guest speaker
at this luncheon?"

51:26.516 --> 51:31.613
I thought about my answer
about being a guest speaker...

51:31.688 --> 51:34.657
for a long time.

51:34.724 --> 51:38.888
Wh-What is
a guest speaker?

51:38.962 --> 51:40.953
Let me clarify this.

51:42.132 --> 51:45.295
I have been called brave.

51:45.368 --> 51:47.734
What is brave?

51:47.804 --> 51:49.795
Let me clarify this.

51:51.475 --> 51:54.774
Of course, we all know
that it is short...

51:54.845 --> 51:57.336
for bravery.

51:57.414 --> 52:00.679
That goes without
even being said.

52:00.750 --> 52:03.878
<i>But it is
also a symbol...</i>

52:03.954 --> 52:06.354
<i>of another thing.</i>

52:06.423 --> 52:09.017
It is a symbol...

52:10.760 --> 52:12.921
of doing one's duty...

52:12.996 --> 52:17.057
no matter what is
scaring him... personally.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.068
<i>Atta boy, Luther.</i>

52:22.772 --> 52:24.865
Take your World War II.

52:24.941 --> 52:28.672
There were many heroes
in World War II.

52:28.745 --> 52:32.738
What were your heroes?
Who were your heroes?

52:34.951 --> 52:37.476
Let me clarify this.

52:37.554 --> 52:39.522
Thank you for having me.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.960
<i>Taro, caro,
salamond.!</i>

52:55.038 --> 52:57.029
Thank you.

52:59.943 --> 53:02.776
Are you Luther Heggs,
1347 Lucerne Road?

53:02.846 --> 53:04.973
You know me,
Lester.

53:05.048 --> 53:07.846
Loved your speech, Luther. Thank you.
What do you want me to write on this?

53:07.918 --> 53:10.478
Nothing. You don't write on a summons.

53:10.554 --> 53:13.352
Summons? Summons? He got a summons.

53:13.423 --> 53:15.789
He got a summons!

53:19.763 --> 53:22.061
Well, exactly what is libel,
Mr. Beckett?

53:22.132 --> 53:24.726
It's when you print an untruth about
someone that damages them, Luther.

53:24.801 --> 53:26.769
Well, who did I damage?
"Whom."

53:26.836 --> 53:29.066
Whom?
The Simmons' family name.

53:34.978 --> 53:37.469
Mr. Simmons.
Room 51.

53:52.996 --> 53:56.432
Step down.
Mr. Heggs,

53:56.499 --> 53:59.559
can I have
your autograph?

53:59.636 --> 54:02.628
He wants my autograph.
Sure.

54:02.706 --> 54:06.005
Just draw a little
ghost under it there.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.067
Okay.

54:15.652 --> 54:17.643
Thank you.

54:31.534 --> 54:33.525
Gentlemen.

54:37.641 --> 54:39.575
My attorney,
Mr. Whitlow.

54:39.643 --> 54:41.577
Mr. Whitlow.
Mr. Whitlow.

54:41.645 --> 54:43.636
Well, let's get
right down to business.

54:43.713 --> 54:45.681
Heggs, as you know,
I'm suing you personally,

54:45.749 --> 54:47.944
<i>and Beckett, I'm suing
the Rachel Courier Express,</i>

54:48.018 --> 54:50.350
of which you are
editor and owner.

54:50.420 --> 54:52.854
Now, if I win this suit,
and I will,

54:52.922 --> 54:55.083
I'm going to
take the paper.

54:55.158 --> 54:57.888
And if I take Beckett's paper, where
are you going to work, Mr. Heggs?

54:59.929 --> 55:04.059
<i>I don't know. Chicago Trib,
Pittsburgh Press maybe.</i>

55:04.134 --> 55:06.864
<i>Now, I don't wanna sue and waste
all that time in court,</i>

55:06.936 --> 55:09.370
so I have an
alternative to offer.

55:09.439 --> 55:11.373
Simply publish the fact
that this story is...

55:11.441 --> 55:13.909
a figment of Heggs' imagination
and I'll call off the suit.

55:13.977 --> 55:17.913
<i>What do you say? In other words,
you want a retraction. Is that it?</i>

55:17.981 --> 55:21.712
Exactly.

55:21.785 --> 55:26.279
Luther, tell me once more that what
you said happened really happened.

55:26.356 --> 55:28.290
It happened.
The wall did open?

55:28.358 --> 55:30.292
Whoosh, right open.
And the organ?

55:30.360 --> 55:32.294
Played and played
and played.

55:32.362 --> 55:34.660
Nobody at it? Not a soul, just cobwebs.

55:34.731 --> 55:39.532
And the shears in the
throat? Shears in the throat!

55:42.238 --> 55:44.798
No retraction.

55:44.874 --> 55:47.342
All right,
we'll see you in court.

55:47.410 --> 55:51.870
Heggs, when I get you on the
stand, I'm gonna tear you to shreds.

55:51.948 --> 55:53.973
Just who do you
think you are?

55:54.050 --> 55:56.678
A little pip-squeak like you
fighting us in court?

55:56.753 --> 55:59.620
Just who do you
think you are?

55:59.689 --> 56:01.623
Drop dead!
That's who!

56:01.691 --> 56:05.923
Right, Mr. Beckett? Mr. Beck... Mr.
Beck... Mr. Beckett? Mr. Beckett?

56:09.599 --> 56:11.999
Boy, you should've heard me
telling them off back there.

56:12.068 --> 56:15.037
Well, you better save your breath for
the courtroom. You're gonna need it.

56:24.214 --> 56:26.148
Step up, please.

56:30.887 --> 56:33.651
I'm sorry, Mr. Heggs.

56:49.639 --> 56:52.767
Boy, that was just about the
best pounded steak I ever ate.

56:52.842 --> 56:55.743
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Mother
really is a wonderful cook.

56:55.812 --> 56:59.942
Oh, yes, she is.
Boy, a guy could get fat.

57:13.997 --> 57:18.696
What was that you just did? Oh,
that was just... That's karate.

57:18.768 --> 57:20.861
I didn't know you knew karate. Oh, yeah.

57:20.937 --> 57:24.805
I've been studying it
by mail for years.

57:24.874 --> 57:26.865
My whole body's a weapon.

57:28.478 --> 57:31.777
Well, that's worthwhile. Yeah.

57:33.016 --> 57:35.883
Would you like to sit
down? Oh, sure. Mm-hmm.

57:45.361 --> 57:48.455
It's nice out.
Yeah.

57:58.708 --> 58:02.735
I guess you think I'm worried
about this trial business tomorrow.

58:02.812 --> 58:05.645
Oh, well... Well, it's
all part of the game.

58:05.715 --> 58:09.151
A newspaper man has to
do whatever comes along.

58:09.219 --> 58:12.382
Everything will be
all right. You'll see.

58:15.558 --> 58:18.857
I've never been on one
of those stands before.

58:20.230 --> 58:22.164
You'll do just fine.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.602
Alma, do you think
I'm crazy?

58:27.670 --> 58:30.867
Luther, what
a silly question.

58:30.940 --> 58:33.602
Well, some people
seem to think so.

58:33.676 --> 58:36.236
You know very well the
whole town is behind you.

58:38.214 --> 58:40.148
Billy Ray Fox
and guys like that ain't.

58:40.216 --> 58:44.380
Well, Billy Ray Fox's opinion
isn't worth a hill of beans.

58:45.788 --> 58:47.881
Hill of beans.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.665
You know something, Alma? What?

59:17.020 --> 59:19.284
A-Alma?
Hmm?

59:22.025 --> 59:24.892
W-Well, the-the thing
is this, Alma.

59:24.961 --> 59:28.294
I mean, well,
you're a darn attractive girl.

59:28.364 --> 59:32.027
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, that's okay.

59:32.101 --> 59:34.092
Me, I'm a... I'm a...
I'm a guy...

59:34.170 --> 59:37.196
and, well, I mean...
what I mean to say is...

59:37.273 --> 59:41.505
you-you take your average guy
and your above-average girl.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.705
<i>And, well,
the point is...</i>

59:43.780 --> 59:47.841
that people, well...

59:47.917 --> 59:50.715
What I'm trying
to say is...

59:50.787 --> 59:54.484
that average, average is just...
just is darn lucky...

59:54.557 --> 59:57.082
to be sittin' on the same porch
with above-average.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.493
And what I mean by that is... Luther.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:03.828
Are you trying to say
that you like me?

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.925
Yeah.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.372
I like you too,
Luther.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.444
I'm sorry, folks, I'm sorry,
but the courtroom is all filled.

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:55.450
Now let's get this door
cleared, please. Please!

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:59.284
Look, here comes Luther!

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:13.331
<i>Go get 'em, Luther.!
Go get 'em.!</i>

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.533
Good luck, Luther.

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.437
Thank you.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.650
What was that all about?
What?

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.588
That cute little nip on
the cheek. What's going on?

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:38.286
You don't own me, Ollie.
You never did.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.295
Oh.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.354
Well, excuse me.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.207
Taro, caro, salamond.

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.268
Yeah, that's right.

01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.245
<i>Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.185
Norman.
Hi, Mr. Springer.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.987
How are you feelin', Luther? Oh, 3-0.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.257
Boy, this place is really buzzin'. Yeah.

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:51.058
Hi, ladies.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:53.466
Have you got
a clean hankie?

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.034
Yeah.

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:05.542
This may cost me my job,
but I hope they fry you.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.976
What'd he say?

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.077
Uh, nothing.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.582
<i>All rise.</i>

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:23.156
Oyez, oyez, oyez. District court
of Rachel County is now in session.

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:27.635
Judge Harley Nash presid... It's
all right, Charley, I'm here.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:32.902
<i>All right, you folks, let's have a
little quiet here. Atta boy, George.!</i>

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:36.433
Now, uh, this is
a case of libel.

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:41.609
<i>Nicholas Simmons versus Luther Heggs, Miles
Beckett and the Rachel Courier Express.</i>

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:45.814
Where's my water, Charley?
Okay, Mr. Whitlow,

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:49.221
<i>you can start it up.
Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.386
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, I intend to prove...

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.588
<i>Here's your water, Judge.</i>

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.599
Thank you, Charley. Where's
the Bible? I haven't got it.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.228
Haven't you got it? No, I haven't
got it. I left it right here.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.932
Can't run a court without a
Bible. Arnold, you got the Bible?

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.307
Oh, thanks, Arnold. Here
it is, Judge. Arnold had it.

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.311
<i>Atta boy, Arnold.!</i>

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:14.679
Thank you, Tom. All right, Mr.
Whitlow, you can start her up again.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.344
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.354
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:23.984
it is my intent to prove that Luther
Heggs did willfully and with full intent...

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.994
<i>concoct and publish
a fabrication injurious...</i>

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:28.587
<i>to the family name of
my client, Nicholas Simmons.</i>

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:32.122
I will prove, in fact,
that this fabrication...

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:35.102
is the product of
the imagination of a man...

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:39.369
whose dreams and ramblings
are a danger to this community.

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:42.434
<i>He's trying to say I'm crazy.
With your permission, Your Honor,</i>

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:45.810
I should like to call my first
witness, Miss Neva Tremaine.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.476
Miss Neva Tremaine.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:52.112
Who is she? She's my
old grade school teacher.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.358
Ma'am, just right
up to the stand.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.729
You wanna put your left hand on the
Bible and raise your right hand, please.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.291
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.702
so help you God?
Mm-hmm. I do.

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:14.471
Charley, your fingernails. I
had a flat on the way to work.

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:17.103
Be seated, please.

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.909
Would you state your name
and address, please? Mm-hmm.

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:24.316
Neva Tremaine, 312 "E"
Street, Rachel, Kansas.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.685
- And your occupation, please.
- Schoolteacher.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.055
Willow Road Elementary School,
third grade, retired.

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.594
Was there one Luther Heggs
a student of yours?

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:35.859
Mm-hmm, he was.
Hi, Luther.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.491
<i>How would you describe
Mr. Heggs as a boy?</i>

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.730
<i>Oh, Luther was
a very good boy.</i>

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:45.069
He got three blue stars
in deportment...

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:47.439
and three gold stars
in penmanship.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.341
<i>How else would
you describe him?</i>

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.710
He was painfully thin
and very keyed up.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:55.877
Would you elaborate on that
phrase, "keyed up"?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.182
Well, let's see.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:02.088
Well, for one thing, he never ate
the crusts on his sandwiches at lunch.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:06.322
I object. I move that that statement
be stricken from the record.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:09.193
A lot of people trim
the crust on their bread.

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:11.495
Young man,
he didn't trim them.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:15.867
<i>He ate the inside out
and left the crust.</i>

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.906
Overruled.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:21.034
<i>And more specifically,
Miss Tremaine,</i>

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.238
how else did he behave,
being keyed up, I mean?

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.338
His shoes
fell off a lot.

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:30.681
But I suppose that could be because
he was so thin and ran so much.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:35.053
- Was he a talkative boy?
- Well, when he had a good story to tell.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:37.718
And Luther made up
some beauties.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:41.627
<i>What kind of stories, Miss
Tremaine? Oh, wild things.</i>

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:44.222
Can you recall any
of them specifically?

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.427
Well, I remember
he told all the boys...

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.562
that he found a real skeleton
in MacQueen's barn.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:55.167
<i>Of a squirrel! A squirrel!
I never said a person skeleton!</i>

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:58.975
<i>Now you just quiet down, Luther, or
I'm gonna have to cite you for contempt.</i>

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:02.916
<i>They were my brother's shoes. That's
why they fell off. Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.654
<i>Quiet down now, folks.</i>

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:14.185
Do you recall any other of Mr. Heggs'
imaginative ramblings, Miss Tremaine?

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:17.562
Oh, lots of things.
He told MaryJane Panucci...

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.999
that the filling
in his eyetooth...

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.037
was a shortwave radio...

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:26.165
<i>and he used to get messages
from Admiral Byrd.</i>

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:33.309
<i>I only wanted her to like me.
Go on, Miss Tremaine.</i>

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.316
Well,
I remember...

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:38.945
I once asked my students to
write a theme called, "My father."

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:43.151
And Luther wrote that his father
was really the Prince of Wales,

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.785
but that there was
a mix-up at the hospital.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.495
Your witness.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.626
No questions.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:58.139
You can step down now, Neva.
Thank you, Harley.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.141
I hope I helped you,
Luther.

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:09.913
Don't you worry
about a thing, Luther.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:13.421
I've got a surprise
witness coming in.

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:15.457
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'll proceed.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.287
- Your full name, sir.
- Gaylord Patie.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:22.421
<i>And what is your occupation? I'm a
certified public accountant for the state.</i>

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:27.091
Now, then, I understand
that you, Mr. Patie,

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:29.899
have heard the organ playing
in the Simmons mansion.

01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:31.906
Am I correct, sir?
You are.

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:35.603
I have heard organ music coming from
the tower of the Simmons mansion...

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.703
on three
separate occasions.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.350
<i>That's why I came
to you, Mr. Springer.</i>

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.410
And at what time
did you hear this music?

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.979
At the stroke
of midnight.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:51.390
And what else have you heard coming
from the Simmons mansion, Mr. Patie?

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.419
On the first occasion,
a woman's scream.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.261
And on the second and third
occasions, a man's scream.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.805
What kind of screams
were they, Mr. Patie?

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.104
Wild, maniacal screams.

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:12.843
<i>Thank you.
Your witness.</i>

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:17.443
<i>Mr. Patie, I understand that you're
president of the International Conclave...</i>

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.148
For Unidentified Flying
Objects. That is correct, sir.

01:09:20.221 --> 01:09:23.247
- Where was your last meeting?
- On Mars.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:35.862
You may step down.

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.907
Wait till I get
Heggs on the stand.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.136
Luther Heggs
to the stand, please.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.839
<i>Luther Heggs.</i>

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:56.357
Taro, caro, salamond.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.385
Luther, what is
that all about?

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:04.990
Uh, taro, caro,
salamond.

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:10.164
Oh. Well, you lodge women, you
just sit down and keep seated.

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.605
All right, Charley,
swear in the witness.

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:16.508
Put your left hand on the Bible
and raise your right hand, please.

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.513
You swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:20.515
so help you God?
I do.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:24.144
Be seated.
All right, Mr. Whitlow.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.154
<i>Your, uh...</i>

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.453
Your full name is Luther Heggs,
is that correct? Yes, sir.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:32.551
Do you mind if I call you Luther? Fine.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.597
Relax, son.
Oh, I am.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:39.100
I'll try not to keep you on the stand
any longer than necessary, Luther.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:42.228
Oh, I don't mind.
It's all part of the game.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:45.535
What game is that?
The newspaper game.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:48.873
Oh, I see. You really love the
newspaper game, don't you, Luther?

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:52.937
Yeah, I sure do. I guess if
you cut me, I'd bleed ink.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.575
That's very funny.
Thank you.

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:59.018
You certainly have a flair for
turning a colorful phrase, Luther.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:04.424
Well... Well,
when you work with words,

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:07.553
words are your work.
Mmm, bravo.

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.827
Yes, I expect you learn a good deal about
words down there in that typesetting room.

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.527
Oh, I'm just filling in time
in the typesetting room.

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:17.504
Oh, I see. You'd do anything to become
a full-time reporter, is that correct?

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.508
Well, sure. Who wouldn't?
After all, a chance...

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:24.342
Including exaggerating and fabricating,
eh? Gotta be a fool to... What?

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:28.349
I'm asking you a question! Can't you
curb your imagination for one minute?

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:31.215
<i>Can't you curb your tongue for
a minute? Atta boy, Luther.!</i>

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:35.013
Quiet down.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:39.618
Isn't it true, Heggs, that you were
offered a full-time job as a reporter...

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:42.255
if you brought back a
sensational story from that house?

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.629
A story which, in truth, you
made up out of your own head.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.725
No, that's not true.
I saw those things.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:49.236
- Yes, yes.
- I heard those things!

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.034
<i>He heard those things.</i>

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:54.075
Those church bells rang!
Yes, yes!

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.135
The organ played!
Oh, yes, it played.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:12:00.545
I saw the bloodstains on the
keys, and they're still there!

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:02.811
And they used Bon Ami!

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:07.278
- Tell it, Luther! Tell it!
- And when I ran downstairs,

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:10.291
I came face to face with
a painting of Mrs. Simmons.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:14.659
There was a pair of garden shears stuck in
her throat, blood gushing from the wound!

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.933
Mrs. Maxwell fainted,
Judge.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.903
Some of you huskies
back there pick her up...

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:24.939
and get her out under
a tree or something.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.874
Keep her head up!
Keep her feet up!

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:30.434
No, keep her head
higher than her feet!

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:36.182
Quiet!
Quiet down!

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:37.912
<i>Quiet down.!</i>

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.284
<i>Quiet down here now.!</i>

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:44.258
<i>You listen to me, 'cause I'm gonna
tell you something right now.!</i>

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:47.124
I don't know whether
I believe in ghosts or not.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.664
Many the night I've talked
about this with my missus.

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:52.826
But I do know, there's only
one way of finding out...

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.699
if there's something going
on in that Simmons place.

01:12:55.771 --> 01:13:00.231
This court hereby orders the
jury and interested parties...

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:05.110
to meet here in front of this
courthouse at 11:30 tonight.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:09.708
And we're going down to the
Simmons house and see for ourselves.

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.720
Court's adjourned.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.139
<i>All right, ladies,
back up now.</i>

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:36.803
Back up, ladies. Back. Back up. Back up.

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:39.814
Okay, Chief, looks like
we're all ready.

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:42.112
Open her up.
All right, Judge.

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:46.279
Judge, you're all right.
You're all right.

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:49.950
Good luck, Luther.
Oh.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:53.017
I believe in you, Luther. I
believe in what you stand for.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.029
And my group is
sharing this with you.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.622
And that's
akin to love.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:01.692
Well, taro, caro...
Salamond!

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.706
You're coming in with me, aren't
you? I don't think they'll let me.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.710
Come on. You're with me. Okay.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:13.043
She's with me! Luther,
Alma, Kelsey... Kelsey!

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.049
Where do you think you're going? Press.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.609
Who do you think you're
kidding? Out! Out! Out!

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.681
Sorry.

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:29.928
Uh, I better
go in first.

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:40.304
All right, everybody,
this way.

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:44.038
Now let me have your attention
for just one minute.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:48.674
Now I'm gonna take you on a tour
duplicating my movements of that night.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.776
Now you're apt to see some
pretty frightening things,

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:55.381
but don't panic, you're
in no real personal danger.

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:58.654
<i>Now you ladies of thejury,
stay close together.</i>

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.661
Hold hands
if you wish.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:04.221
First, I'm gonna take you into the
den and then up to the organ loft...

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.426
Say, isn't that the picture of
Mrs. Simmons you were talking about?

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.835
Yeah, well, first I wanna take them
into the den. Well, it is, isn't it?

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.840
Where's the garden shears?
Where's the blood?

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.842
It seems to me there should
be a hole in it somewhere.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:17.242
Well, I'm sure
there is.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.572
Let me... I'll just show
you... Well, I mean...

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.515
<i>Well, that's funny.</i>

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:27.112
Maybe that's not
the same picture.

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:32.455
I don't think that's the same
picture. That's okay, Luther.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:36.862
If you've seen one picture of a woman with
shears stuck in her throat, you've seen 'em all.

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:40.527
Luther, why don't you start the tour
with the wall that opens. Yeah, yeah.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:45.130
All right, everybody, I'm gonna show you
the wall that opens. The opening wall!

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.437
Right this way.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:49.443
I know what
our trouble was back there.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:52.776
That happened after the midnight
bells. My mind's wide open.

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:57.952
All right, people, in here.
Right in here.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.046
Okay, here it is.
The panel that opens.

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:05.652
<i>Right here it is.!</i>

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:08.025
<i>You're gonna see
the opening panel.!</i>

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:11.793
Now, I was standing
about right here.

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:14.028
I picked up a book...

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:16.036
and I threw it
at the bookcase...

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:18.902
and whoosh, she opened.

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:25.039
I-I-I picked up a book...

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:28.640
and I threw it,
and whoosh!

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.083
Whoosh!

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:35.052
Well, I picked...
picked up a book and l...

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:43.026
I-I can't understand it.
It... It opens up!

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.658
There's-There's a staircase
in there and everything.

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.668
He's a real loser.

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:50.500
Luther,
it's almost midnight.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:53.837
Maybe we better be getting
along to the organ part of it.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:56.605
But I can't understand it.
It opened right up!

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:59.010
Whoosh!
That's right.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:02.847
Yeah. Well... All right, all
right, up to the organ loft!

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.476
Come on, folks.
Up to the organ loft.

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:07.852
Follow me to the organ loft.
The organ loft is next.

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:16.521
Now, folks,
it's almost midnight,

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:20.432
and the ghost of Mr. Simmons will be up in
the organ loft in just a matter of minutes.

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:25.731
All right. Folks, Priscilla
here doesn't want to go up.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:29.106
<i>Any of you other ladies
feel the same way?</i>

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:31.509
The men feel
the same way too, Judge.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.414
Very well. Jury is excused
from going up in the organ loft.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:38.578
You can wait down here
for us in the entry hall.

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:16.483
Look, the bloodstains.
That's right. I told you.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.952
What time you got,
Judge?

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:24.590
It's, uh, just
ten seconds to midnight.

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:28.466
Good. All right,
steady does it.

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:46.076
Okay.

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:50.215
Here we go.
This is ridiculous.

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.283
Come on now.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:57.831
Come on.
Come on, baby.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.833
<i>Come on.!</i>

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:04.167
One and a two and...

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:18.183
Luther, I think
that's about it.

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:22.153
But... But...

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.215
it played!

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:27.125
I'm tellin' you,
it played!

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:30.392
You saw the bloodstains
on the keys!

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.133
It played.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:42.603
It played.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.146
Oh, here they come!
Here they come!

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.745
Make room!
Make room!

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:58.657
Make room. Clear a path here. Clear a path.

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:09.526
Might as well tell these people to go
home, Chief. There's nothing in there.

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:13.040
Just an old empty house. Just imagination.

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:15.906
All right, folks, break it up.
It's all over.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:17.911
Judge says there's
nothing in there.

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:20.311
Run along home.

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:56.147
Well, we're finished,
Luther.

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:58.516
You better find yourself
another job.

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.646
I'm sorry, Mr. Beckett.
Couldn't we just...

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:05.352
Please, just leave
me alone, Luther!

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:08.624
Just leave me alone,
hmm?

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:02.094
Mr. Kelsey!

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.637
You!

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.731
I thought this would get
you back in here, Luther.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:10.676
Where are the others? They
all left. You mean, you?

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.543
It was me playin' the organ
the night you were here.

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.549
I stabbed the painting,
everything.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:19.178
But when the organ was playing,
there was nobody at it.

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.882
There's a tuning keyboard
under the pipes.

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:24.948
Well...
where were you tonight?

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:27.119
That dumb Herkie
wouldn't let me in.

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.163
What's this all about?
I don't understand.

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:33.962
That sounds like Alma.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:41.236
<i>Come on.
No, no.!</i>

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:45.245
<i>One step closer
and I'll kill her.!</i>

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.645
Know what these are,
Mr. Simmons?

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:49.979
<i>That's right.</i>

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:53.851
They're my shears! The ones
you used to kill your aunt.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:56.083
And you left them there
to pin it on me!

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:58.819
I'll kill her, Kelsey!
Now let me out of here.

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:01.123
Won't do you a bit
of good, Nicky.

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:04.393
Now everybody's gonna know about
this staircase. Your big alibi, Nicky.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:08.197
It won't help to bulldoze the
house down now! That's far enough!

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:14.273
You go downstairs
and come up behind him.

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.833
How? Push the andiron. It
opens the panel in the study.

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.845
Andiron?

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.343
You killed them both,
didn't you?

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.787
Killed them both for the money
and then tried to pin it on me!

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.791
<i>I'll kill her, Kelsey.!</i>

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.829
Aaah!

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:12.162
Stay out of this, Heggs!

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:14.667
Don't give up now,
Luther. Get him!

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.829
Stay back, Heggs!
Stay back, stay back!

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:19.271
<i>Get him, Luther.!</i>

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.274
<i>Get him.!
Don't let him get away.!</i>

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.310
I'll kill her,
Kelsey.

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.175
Aaah!

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:29.043
Alma,
call the police.

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:38.257
Well, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:41.489
He's right. I pushed the
andiron, and the wall opened up.

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:44.031
Well, you just better learn to
take the word of the press, Chief.

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:46.726
All right, now let me get
this whole thing straight.

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:50.134
You see, the secret staircase
was Simmons' big alibi.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:52.196
That's right.
The big "alibi-rooney"!

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:56.232
That night the old man was up in
the organ loft playing the organ.

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.802
I heard a scuffle coming
from madam's bedroom.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.747
I saw Nick Simmons
run out of the room...

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:04.307
and head for the organ loft. Topside.

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.444
He didn't see me.
He didn't see him.

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:09.854
I went into the room,
and there lay Mrs. Simmons...

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.518
with my garden shears
stuck in her throat.

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:15.188
Here they are!
Here's your murder weapon!

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:18.391
I submit these as exhibit "A."
Watch the prints on those.

01:27:18.466 --> 01:27:20.525
I grabbed those
and put them under my coat.

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:22.536
When the servants
came up the stairs,

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:24.834
we heard a scream
from the organ loft...

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.999
and the thud of a body
falling into the bushes.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.738
We rushed over, and there
on the ground below...

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:33.246
lay the body
of old man Simmons.

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:35.305
Dead as a doornail!

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.578
We turned, started
down the stairs...

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:40.644
and met Nick Simmons coming up,
like he just come home.

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.419
Of course, he'd slipped downstairs
by way of the secret staircase.

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:48.087
How come you took so long to bring
this out in the open, Mr. Kelsey?

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:53.065
I was scared. After all,
that was my shears.

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:55.068
But this was
my last chance.

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:58.299
Well, that wraps it up.
Take him away, Chief.

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:07.981
You knocked
Simmons out, Luther?

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:12.452
That's right, karate. Made my
whole body a weapon. Good boy!

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.858
Do you, Alma, take this man to
be your lawful wedded husband?

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.727
<i>I do.
Do you, Luther,</i>

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:30.362
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.963
I do.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.942
By virtue of
the authority vested in me,

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.535
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:46.382
Luther, you can
kiss her now.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.818
<i>Atta boy, Luther.!</i>
