WEBVTT

00:26.500 --> 00:29.792
Check, check, check one,
check two, check three.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.875
Mmm.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.291
Seems like before I left

00:44.375 --> 00:46.959
you and Suzanne were this big

00:47.041 --> 00:48.458
riding your Sting Rays around.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.125
Now she's getting married.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.250
Me too, soon.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.083
I thought
you were jazzed about it.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.959
I am.
Um, you need a
drink?

00:57.041 --> 00:58.792
- You hungry?
- I can get it.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.166
You sure, Brian?

01:01.959 --> 01:04.166
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.667
Okay, uh..

01:09.667 --> 01:11.125
Okay, let's, uh..

01:11.208 --> 01:13.125
'Let's just get this over
with
so we can eat, huh?'

01:13.208 --> 01:15.417
Mr. and Mrs. Terry Lucas.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.750
Uh, thanks a bunch
for coming, everyone

01:26.834 --> 01:30.333
and uh, ma, dad,
thanks for the new Mustang.

01:30.417 --> 01:31.667
Yay!

01:31.750 --> 01:33.208
Everybody,
we've got five minutes

01:33.291 --> 01:36.333
before we charge you for
your drinks, so get going.

01:36.417 --> 01:40.667
Uh, um, me and Terry also wanna
say a special welcome home

01:40.750 --> 01:44.166
to Fishtown's own war hero,
my maid of honor's brother

01:44.250 --> 01:46.417
and a brother to
me,
Brian McCormick.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.542
"I would have brought
it tonight

01:57.625 --> 01:59.166
"but I didn't wanna embarrass.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.083
'When Suzanne and I were girls,
we rode out all.."'

02:02.166 --> 02:03.166
Oh!

02:03.250 --> 02:05.291
Don't tell me
that guy's your boyfriend.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.750
Fiance, actually.

02:09.458 --> 02:10.542
That guy?

02:10.625 --> 02:12.709
With you?

02:12.792 --> 02:15.000
Well, that's not right.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.834
I'm not sure you
should
be smoking marijuana.

02:17.917 --> 02:19.208
This is a wedding.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.000
'I'm just trying to get
in the spirit.'

03:21.458 --> 03:22.792
Oh, this is a new look.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.625
Yeah, yeah, I slept like crap.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.709
Who we calling on here?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.041
Guy named Warren Cousins.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.792
We got an arrest warrant
for him from 1969.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.208
What's the story?

03:34.291 --> 03:35.959
Well, local Fishtown
girl
was found

03:36.041 --> 03:37.458
strangled in his apartment.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.959
Eleanor McCormick.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.417
What did they get from him
the first time around?

03:40.500 --> 03:42.041
(Stillman)
'There was no first time.'

03:42.125 --> 03:44.959
Warren hightailed it to Canada
the night of the murder.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.083
- The Mounties couldn't help?
- 'They couldn't find him.'

03:47.166 --> 03:49.834
They think he changed his name
up there, went underground.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.333
No one's heard word one
from him in 36 years.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.041
What brought him back
to Philly?

03:54.125 --> 03:56.458
Father's funeral.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.709
He's holed up with
an old buddy in this place.

03:58.792 --> 04:02.125
Busybody neighbor recognized
him, called it in.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.542
Let's go.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.583
Philadelphia PD
for Warren Cousins.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.583
I'm Warren.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.000
Warren Cousins,
you're under
arrest

04:29.083 --> 04:31.792
for the 1969 murder
of Eleanor
McCormick.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.375
What? Ellie's dead?

05:11.792 --> 05:14.333
(Stillman)
Witnesses saw Warren
hassling Ellie

05:14.417 --> 05:16.917
at her best friend's wedding.
He was the singer.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.542
(Valens)
'What? Trying to get a
piece?'

05:18.625 --> 05:21.583
Well, only Ellie's engaged.
Shuts him down.

05:21.667 --> 05:22.875
A few weeks later,
she's got the life

05:22.959 --> 05:24.291
choked out of her
at his place.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.709
Autopsy shows bruising
on her knees and neck.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.500
- Strangled.
- By someone with dirty hands.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.083
Unidentified
residue
across her throat.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.000
- Prints come with that?
- Hmm.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.917
It's only
partial.
No help.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.667
Let's have Frannie
take a look at the autopsy.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.583
Maybe modern medicine
tells us more.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.041
Yeah, maybe the lab
can ID the dirt.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.208
(Vera)
Found a relative of your
girl.

05:44.291 --> 05:47.959
Brother Brian still lives
at the old address.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.542
Oh, you and Will
sit down with
him.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.125
You don't believe
in shaving anymore?

05:54.750 --> 05:57.250
It was a late night.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.208
Why are you looking so haggard?

05:59.291 --> 06:01.542
Man, I should go home
and start over again.

06:05.458 --> 06:06.834
There's no reason.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.750
I haven't spoken to Ellie
in 36 years.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.333
Sort of the point here, Warren.

06:17.417 --> 06:20.375
I mean I didn't know
she was dead.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.792
God, I wouldn't kill her.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.458
We had a
relationship.
I loved her.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.542
So true love made you
change your name

06:27.625 --> 06:29.125
and disappear for 36 years?

06:29.208 --> 06:31.750
I went to Canada because
I was a draft resister.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.709
And all those years,
you never write to her.

06:33.792 --> 06:36.458
- Pick up the phone?
- I couldn't. I was a
fugitive.

06:36.542 --> 06:37.959
What about down here?

06:38.041 --> 06:40.125
No one told you
the cops were looking for you?

06:40.208 --> 06:42.750
I broke off all
contact
with my old life.

06:42.834 --> 06:45.041
The buddy I went to Canada with
came back in the 90s.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.125
He called me when
he saw my Dad's
obit.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.709
And you never asked after Ellie?

06:50.709 --> 06:53.166
Ellie was the one who got away.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.792
I still thought about
her,
but I let her go

06:54.875 --> 06:56.542
when she didn't
come north with
me.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.291
How we doin'?

07:00.375 --> 07:04.000
Oh, Warren says Ellie
was going to Canada too.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.291
It's Bonnie and Clyde, huh?

07:05.375 --> 07:06.834
Runnin' from the law?

07:06.917 --> 07:09.208
That was the plan,
but she never showed up.

07:09.291 --> 07:12.417
Well, couple of hanks
in that story, Warren.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.333
Yeah, like her being dead
in your apartment.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.667
She left her suitcase
there,
earlier that day.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.667
Maybe she went to get it
and someone killed her.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.834
Uh, there was no suitcase
in the crime report.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.709
Now, how's the story really go?

07:26.792 --> 07:29.500
A screw-up like you sets
his sights on a pretty girl.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.750
Can't close the deal,
so she gets punished?

07:32.834 --> 07:34.959
- You got it all wrong.
- Hmm.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.041
Ellie's the one
who came after me.

07:40.709 --> 07:42.333
When me and Suzanne were seven

07:42.417 --> 07:45.583
we planned our whole life out
and wrote it in a diary.

07:45.667 --> 07:46.875
'I would have brought it
tonight'

07:46.959 --> 07:49.250
but I don't wanna
embarrass her.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.083
See, she wrote pages and pages

07:51.166 --> 07:53.166
about how she was moving out
to Hollywood

07:53.250 --> 07:55.792
and becoming Mrs. Elvis Presley.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.458
Eh, that's no fair.
She did, too.

07:59.542 --> 08:02.709
But I'm so glad she found
her real true love

08:02.792 --> 08:04.125
here in Fishtown.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.000
'Because the life that
I wrote in that diary'

08:07.083 --> 08:10.709
was that she was my neighbor,
my maid of honor

08:10.792 --> 08:12.709
'the godmother of my children'

08:12.792 --> 08:14.542
and my best friend for life.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.208
So, here's to that.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.291
I don't know why
I came out here.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.458
- I don't even know you.
- Maybe that's why.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.083
Stupid, right?
My speech.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.250
No.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.750
I saw your brother in there.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.333
See his girlfriend ditch him?

09:26.750 --> 09:29.125
Wish I knew what to do for him.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.458
How about just talking to him?

09:31.542 --> 09:32.959
Bet that would mean something.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.667
You going to Vietnam?

09:38.166 --> 09:39.625
No.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.875
It's not a cause
I'd give my life for.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.834
So you're one of those.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:50.417 --> 09:51.625
What are you?

09:54.333 --> 09:57.000
Not sure, lately.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.583
When you said
it wasn't
right

10:00.667 --> 10:02.250
about me and my fiance..

10:03.709 --> 10:05.000
...what did you mean?

10:06.250 --> 10:07.709
Do you know..

10:14.125 --> 10:17.250
...it's impossible
not to look at you?

10:18.625 --> 10:21.041
[chuckles]
No.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.458
'Oh, it is.'

10:22.542 --> 10:24.750
It's not just you being pretty.

10:26.750 --> 10:27.959
It's how you are.

10:31.166 --> 10:34.875
I...really enjoyed
your singing.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.208
Really.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.917
'I know you have a guy.'

10:41.000 --> 10:44.083
But I'm a Valentine's Day baby.

10:44.166 --> 10:47.417
I just say it
if I feel it.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.583
We were together
for six weeks after
that.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.709
Then I left.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.542
A one conversation
at a wedding

11:06.625 --> 11:08.375
and Ellie chucks
her marriage plans

11:08.458 --> 11:10.250
to take up with you.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.291
Yeah.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.417
I still ain't hearin'

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
how she ends up dead
at your place.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.583
I don't know how that happened.

11:15.667 --> 11:19.041
All I know is
I loved that
girl.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.875
And that always ends well.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.125
This works out nice.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.500
We got room in the trunk?

11:28.709 --> 11:30.041
Brian McCormick?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.125
Are you the detectives
that called?

11:33.208 --> 11:35.583
It's about Warren Cousins.
He's back in town.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.375
What does the creep have
to say for himself?

11:40.458 --> 11:42.875
Says it wasn't him
who killed your sister.

11:42.959 --> 11:44.750
(Jeffries)
'You got ideas otherwise,
Brian?'

11:44.834 --> 11:47.959
She's dead in his
apartment.
That gives me ideas.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.041
Warren says he and your sister
had a relationship.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.166
He does, huh?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.291
Anything to that?

11:54.375 --> 11:58.375
Well, something had hold
of Ellie those last weeks.

11:58.458 --> 11:59.792
Maybe Warren.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.291
Seemed like something beatnik.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.458
(Ellie)
You okay?

12:08.542 --> 12:11.583
Yeah, I-I couldn't sleep
last night, that's all.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.333
- Oh, hold on. Dad.
- I can do it.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.375
- Pat, Brian needs you.
- It's okay, mom.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.542
(Pat)
Hold on, hold on,
I'm here.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.458
I gotta admit I'm nervous.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.750
What was it like there, Bri?

12:33.834 --> 12:35.000
Muggy.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.625
Mosquitoes there
are like freaking crows.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.542
- How about the war part?
- Ellie.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.917
'Cause they're saying
we're losing and not
prepared.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.083
Is it true?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.333
Ellie, your
brother
wants to brag

12:47.417 --> 12:48.458
he'll do it to me over beers.

12:48.542 --> 12:49.583
I just wanna hear about it.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.417
Eleanor..

12:51.500 --> 12:53.333
...it's starting.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.291
(man on TV)
'The birthdates
in today's draft lottery'

12:56.375 --> 12:57.875
'are as follows..'

12:59.417 --> 13:01.166
You never know who
to trust over there.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.333
- When they did this..
- 'June 23rd.'

13:04.417 --> 13:06.333
...it was just a little girl.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.458
She comes up to me
like she needs help.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.417
Opens her hand..

13:12.500 --> 13:14.166
(man on TV)
'May 20th.'

13:16.500 --> 13:19.417
- 'October 9th.'
- Oh, man, that's Terry.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.250
'February 14th.'

13:22.500 --> 13:24.625
'November 6th.'

13:24.709 --> 13:25.917
'March 12th.'

13:26.000 --> 13:27.875
Keeping your fingers
crossed for me, babe?

13:29.750 --> 13:31.208
Hey, what's the matter with you?

13:31.291 --> 13:32.709
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.208
My birthday wasn't called yet.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.667
[sobbing]
I know. I know.

13:38.083 --> 13:41.375
Yeah. You're real strange
lately, Ellie, you know
that?

13:51.959 --> 13:53.667
What was she crying about?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.291
Don't know.

13:55.375 --> 13:59.208
The guy she's in love with
since she's 12 just got
saved.

13:59.291 --> 14:00.500
Made no sense.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.792
Okay, Brian.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.458
It's been most
of my life now but..

14:06.542 --> 14:09.000
'...it never settles with you.'

14:09.083 --> 14:11.291
Not being somebody's
older brother anymore.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.959
[sighs]
What got Ellie
so upset that night?

14:22.041 --> 14:24.792
Maybe a shock to her, what
her brother said about
Vietnam.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.250
Hmm.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.709
Lab did a rush job
for you.

14:27.792 --> 14:28.917
Get anything good?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.750
Swabbed the residue
around your girl's neck.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.917
Found minute traces
of chrome in it.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.542
Came from the doer's hands?

14:34.625 --> 14:37.458
Maybe flaked off a
car,
appliance.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.125
(Frannie)
'Besides the knee
and neck bruises'

14:39.208 --> 14:41.583
there was an abrasion above her
eye from an earlier injury.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.625
Earlier by hours?

14:43.709 --> 14:44.875
More like days.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.208
So, chrome on the doer's hands

14:47.291 --> 14:49.625
plus someone roughed
her up recently.

14:49.709 --> 14:53.792
What if it was the draft
lottery
Ellie was reacting to?

14:53.875 --> 14:55.625
'Fifth birthday called.'

14:55.709 --> 14:57.792
February 14,
Valentine's Day.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.083
Lover boy, Warren.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.166
And she was crying
'cause he got drafted.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.917
Maybe she did love him.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.208
- Oh!
- Just getting in?

15:25.291 --> 15:26.625
I slept at the bar.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.333
Sure, you did.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.166
- What?
- Chris, I'm a detective.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.417
I met someone.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.125
[sighs]
He from the bar?

15:41.208 --> 15:44.333
Yeah, but it's not like
how you think, Lil.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.417
Uh-huh.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.750
It's someone good,
for a change.

15:47.834 --> 15:51.417
We talk, and laugh,
and connect.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.542
Really.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.667
He taking you out
for your birthday tomorrow?

16:01.750 --> 16:03.875
''Cause if not..'

16:05.166 --> 16:06.250
...I am.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.500
That would be great.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.709
I wouldn't have guessed it,
but, uh..

16:13.709 --> 16:15.667
...it's been good..

16:15.750 --> 16:17.041
...having you here.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.000
Part of your story
holds up, Warren.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.875
- Maybe Ellie did fall for
you.
- Okay.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.250
There's a part
that's still
shady.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.208
All her stuff was at
home
and accounted for.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.542
No missing suitcase.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.667
I told you what I know.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.041
It was light blue,
white handles.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.417
You know anything
about her fiance?

17:01.709 --> 17:03.750
Bud Lydecker?

17:03.834 --> 17:05.083
I just saw him at the wedding.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.000
Well, you two got together.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.041
Means Ellie must have
broken up with him,
right?

17:09.125 --> 17:10.166
Yeah.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.083
You know anything
about how he handled
it?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.625
Getting traded in for a..

17:14.709 --> 17:16.709
For a long-haired draft dodger.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.625
Probably wasn't thrilled.

17:21.709 --> 17:23.375
Any specific backlash?

17:25.375 --> 17:28.458
I-I didn't think so
at the time, but..

17:28.542 --> 17:30.834
...Ellie did come
to see me one night.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.542
About a week
after the wedding.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.917
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.917
I did not think you would come.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.166
Hello.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.500
- Oh, this is--
- Oh, yeah, the-the bride.

18:29.583 --> 18:32.250
- Congratulations.
- Oh, yeah.

18:32.333 --> 18:35.000
My husband would flip his lid
to see this place.

18:35.083 --> 18:39.000
I just saw this woman
with, like, paint on her

18:39.083 --> 18:40.875
and nothing else.

18:42.834 --> 18:46.208
Can I get you something?
Uh, beer? Dope?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.917
- You guys--
- Oh, no, no.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.208
Look, you know what?
Maybe I would.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.083
The Beatles do it,
so, you know..

18:53.166 --> 18:54.375
I'll have a beer.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.917
- Uh, this powder room?
- Yeah, it's right over
there.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.542
I talked to my brother.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.208
You did?

19:15.291 --> 19:17.333
It was bad
for him over
there.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.208
My parents don't wanna
hear it, but..

19:19.291 --> 19:21.750
...I think
he wants to
talk..

19:21.834 --> 19:23.041
...like you said.

19:25.291 --> 19:28.709
I keep thinking
about everything you
said.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.875
I keep thinking about you.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.166
Yo, yo, that's twisted, man.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.625
That was him,
Ell.
You know it was.

19:45.709 --> 19:47.750
- Who?
- No one.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.000
You think Bud threw that brick?

19:56.083 --> 19:58.208
Must be who they meant.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.583
Yeah, okay.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.792
Maybe he's the one who should
be cooling it in here.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.500
Let me go see
to my dad's arrangements.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.583
You're still our number one
guy,
Warren.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.417
Detective.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.542
Did you find
anything else out..

20:13.667 --> 20:14.959
...about Ellie?

20:19.583 --> 20:22.709
She, uh, cried
when you got
drafted.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.750
(Bud)
'Knock it down, and..'

20:43.709 --> 20:45.375
Okay, take a look around.
Go on.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.542
Oh, I'm losing 'em.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.583
- Nice timing.
- You want another 36 years?

20:53.667 --> 20:55.667
Aw, crap, go ahead.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.166
Uh, you said
it was about Ellie?

20:57.250 --> 20:59.291
Wondering how you took
it
when she threw you over

20:59.375 --> 21:01.000
for this Warren guy.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.458
Uh, I'm the one threw her over.

21:03.542 --> 21:07.000
I dried up on us after my buddy,
Terry's wedding. Cut her loose.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.250
So that brick through
her new guy's window

21:09.333 --> 21:11.542
that was you saying
we could still be friends?

21:11.625 --> 21:13.709
Ah, the brick.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.583
Yeah, I'll cop to that.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.333
But I didn't know
the hippie lived there.

21:17.417 --> 21:20.959
- That was meant for
bridezilla.
- Suzanne?

21:21.041 --> 21:23.291
On account of her behavior
at the wedding.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.542
- 'Oh, my God! Oh, my God!'
- Oh, my God, Ellie, it's--

21:29.625 --> 21:31.083
Suzanne, what are you doing?

21:31.166 --> 21:32.250
What, you need an interpreter?

21:32.333 --> 21:34.417
Terry! Terry!

21:35.500 --> 21:37.542
Shh! Bud, just,
just
turn around,
okay?

21:37.625 --> 21:39.208
'I gotta pull myself
up here.'

21:41.750 --> 21:43.750
I undid all those buttons?

21:43.834 --> 21:45.291
Please, just leave,
okay?

21:49.333 --> 21:51.083
You son of a..

21:51.166 --> 21:52.542
I'll kill you!

21:57.583 --> 21:59.375
- Don't look at me like
that.
- Geez, Suzanne.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.125
I know, Ell, I know.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.667
Ell, look at me.

22:02.750 --> 22:05.417
After what you told me,
don't be a hypocrite.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.333
Whoa. Wh-what the heck
is that about?

22:08.417 --> 22:10.041
- Nothing.
- God, damn it!

22:10.125 --> 22:12.542
What are you two talking about?

22:12.625 --> 22:14.083
Just forget it, bud.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.208
[grunts]
Fishtown
bitches!

22:22.917 --> 22:24.792
So you break up with Ellie

22:24.875 --> 22:27.417
because her best
friend's
a cheater.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.291
Birds of a feather.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.083
Ellie would be following
suit soon enough.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.583
Besides, I'm with the same
girl
since I'm 12.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.709
I was done.

22:35.792 --> 22:38.667
What Suzanne mean
Ellie was a hypocrite?

22:38.750 --> 22:41.417
Uh, something related
to their chick conspiracy.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.125
'I didn't press for details.'

22:43.208 --> 22:45.583
You'll have to ask 'zilla
herself.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.291
You got an alibi
for when Ellie
died?

22:47.375 --> 22:49.709
Working late
at the sugar factory.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.291
My pop waited up to tell me.

22:53.959 --> 22:57.291
She was the first person
I knew close that died.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.625
Hmm. Ellie.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.834
So, you finally
got that singer, huh?

23:12.917 --> 23:14.709
Warren Cousins? Yeah.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.333
He's in custody
for Ellie's murder.

23:16.417 --> 23:18.625
It's a long time comin'.

23:18.709 --> 23:22.625
Suzanne, uh, Warren says
he and Ellie were in love.
True?

23:22.709 --> 23:26.875
Oh, she was dreamy about him.
No other man could compare.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.291
Not Bud?

23:29.375 --> 23:31.250
Bud, or the rest
of the species.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.542
We heard about
that brick
incident.

23:33.625 --> 23:34.875
Bud said that was on him.

23:34.959 --> 23:36.333
I knew it.

23:36.417 --> 23:39.250
Yeah, but he mentioned
a different reason.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.583
Somethin' about
your wedding night?

23:40.667 --> 23:43.250
Yeah, mistakes were made.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.125
Well, what did you
mean
that night

23:46.208 --> 23:48.625
calling Ellie a hypocrite?

23:48.709 --> 23:51.834
Well, she told me
about meeting Warren, and..

23:51.917 --> 23:54.834
...it was suddenly making her
question things.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.625
Oh, like
settling
with Buddy boy?

23:56.709 --> 23:59.291
And endin' up
with her mother's life.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.208
Same thing crossed my mind
walking down the aisle.

24:02.291 --> 24:04.458
So, at the reception,
all I'm thinkin' is

24:04.542 --> 24:06.709
"What did I just do?"

24:06.792 --> 24:08.000
Enter the drummer.

24:09.500 --> 24:12.375
So, was Ellie gonna do
something to change her
plans?

24:13.709 --> 24:14.959
Yeah.

24:17.291 --> 24:20.000
(Suzanne)
'Wish my parents never got us
that Mustang.'

24:20.083 --> 24:24.291
Terry's been in the driveway
every single day this month.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.875
Doesn't have a word
to say to me.

24:26.959 --> 24:30.542
'Suz? I don't think it's
like this with everyone.'

24:32.125 --> 24:34.417
Yeah, oh, well,
his birthday got called

24:34.500 --> 24:36.083
so he's a little upset.

24:37.834 --> 24:39.125
You wanna be like this?

24:40.375 --> 24:44.959
Suz, there are men
who are different..

24:45.041 --> 24:47.250
...you could have
a new life with.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.542
And they'd let you
be
who you are.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.333
That's what they want.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.208
And they would never..

24:53.291 --> 24:54.291
They would die first, Suz.

24:54.375 --> 24:55.834
They would never hurt you.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.542
Really?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.000
You wanna leave here?

25:04.083 --> 25:08.083
Go someplace far out and start
over where Terry can't find us?

25:08.166 --> 25:09.500
'Cause Warren's going to Canada.

25:09.583 --> 25:10.709
We could too.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.083
Ellie!

25:14.166 --> 25:15.834
Uh, you got a lot
to say today, huh?

25:15.917 --> 25:17.792
Just, uh, catchin' up, Terry.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.083
[chuckles]
Oh!

25:21.333 --> 25:22.750
- Huh!
- Terry!

25:22.834 --> 25:24.333
Don't you yammer about me
when I'm out working.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.875
- No, I didn't. Yeah.
- Do you understand?

25:25.959 --> 25:28.583
And don't bring stupid talk
into my house.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.500
She don't need any more wild
ideas than she's already got.

25:30.583 --> 25:33.458
- That's what you say.
- Oh, okay, okay.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.083
That's the conversation.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.250
(Terry)
'Oh, by the way'

25:44.333 --> 25:46.375
I know where you go
at night, Ellie.

25:49.625 --> 25:50.792
Whore.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.291
(Rush)
'He meant Warren's place.'

26:01.375 --> 26:02.458
(Suzanne)
'Yeah.'

26:02.542 --> 26:05.000
Where Ellie was killed.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.959
Where was Terry
the night she
died?

26:07.041 --> 26:09.542
Oh, out till morning,
getting blitzed.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.583
Hmm.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.667
He wouldn't have hurt her.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.583
We grew up together,
all of us.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.750
But he was in a bad
way
then, right?

26:19.542 --> 26:20.667
Yeah.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.291
You said Terry
was working on a Mustang?

26:23.375 --> 26:25.750
Yeah, '65.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.583
His true love,
trust me.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.333
Hmm.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.625
It's a chrome bumper.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.959
What kinda person
makes a kid

26:50.041 --> 26:52.208
run those at 8:00
in the mornin'?

26:52.291 --> 26:53.834
You coming down
on me for that?

26:53.917 --> 26:57.041
No, we're homicide.
It's a little more serious.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.291
Sit-ups until the whistle.

27:01.750 --> 27:05.166
- You remember Ellie McCormick?
- Yeah, sure. Great girl.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.625
We hear she tried
to get your wife

27:06.709 --> 27:09.041
to pull a "Thelma &
Louise"
on you.

27:09.125 --> 27:12.000
Run off together,
leave you all
alone.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.208
You'd be short a punching
bag,
thanks to Ellie.

27:14.291 --> 27:16.041
The girls were always talkin'.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.166
It was just talk.

27:17.250 --> 27:19.291
But you took 'em seriously.

27:19.375 --> 27:20.542
What did you call her again?

27:20.625 --> 27:22.667
It was something unflattering,
I think.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.750
Plus, there was
chrome
on her body

27:25.834 --> 27:27.041
like on your Mustang.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.875
From your hands
to her neck.

27:28.959 --> 27:31.417
And you knew where she went
at night, right? Hmm.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.000
Oh, heck.

27:34.083 --> 27:36.875
Okay, straight story.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.083
I went over there, once.

27:39.166 --> 27:40.375
To give Ellie what for?

27:40.458 --> 27:42.959
No, I heard the girls schemin'.

27:43.041 --> 27:45.542
I thought maybe
I could change my plans

27:45.625 --> 27:47.083
'cause all I had
to look forward to

27:47.166 --> 27:48.625
was going to die in the jungle.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.583
- Ellie!
- What are you doing here?

27:57.667 --> 27:59.875
I know what you think
of me right now.

27:59.959 --> 28:02.166
But I'm just not
in my right way.

28:02.250 --> 28:04.709
I'm flipped out.

28:04.792 --> 28:06.667
You know I'm going
to 'Nam, right?

28:06.750 --> 28:09.417
I know your birthday
got called.

28:09.500 --> 28:12.125
Well, I saw your
brother
at the wedding.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.875
Katie looking around
during the dance
songs

28:13.959 --> 28:15.250
embarrassed to be with him.

28:16.792 --> 28:18.083
That can't be me.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.250
You're nothing
like him, Terry.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.583
I gotta go.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.667
Ellie, wait!

28:24.750 --> 28:27.333
I know Suzanne
doesn't love me.

28:27.417 --> 28:28.959
So maybe..

28:29.041 --> 28:30.458
Maybe I should just beat it
to Canada

28:30.542 --> 28:32.542
where you and that guy
are going.

28:32.625 --> 28:34.166
[sighs]
Can I talk to him?

28:34.250 --> 28:35.375
No, you can't come in.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.125
But I'm scared.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.500
Like your boyfriend..

28:39.667 --> 28:41.625
He's not scared.

28:41.709 --> 28:43.250
He has beliefs.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.083
Find your own way to Canada.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.709
So, you wanted to duck
the draft too?

28:54.083 --> 28:55.458
Didn't have the nerve though.

28:55.542 --> 28:57.208
[sighs]
Got lucky.

28:57.291 --> 29:00.083
Ended up watching
the border in Korea.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.834
How do you know
where to find
Ellie?

29:01.917 --> 29:03.333
From Bud.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.458
Wait, Bud was still keeping
tabs after they were over?

29:05.542 --> 29:08.125
He was only camped out there
night after night.

29:08.208 --> 29:10.458
I-I thought he gave
Ellie
the brush-off.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.875
Hey, it's not for me to say.

29:13.959 --> 29:16.834
But if that's how it went,
why was he stalkin' her?

29:18.750 --> 29:20.208
(Bud)
'I already talked
to the other two.'

29:20.291 --> 29:21.959
- Yeah, I know.
- So, what am I doing here?

29:22.041 --> 29:23.667
I guess we didn't
get
the truth just yet

29:23.750 --> 29:25.333
about how you and Ellie ended.

29:25.417 --> 29:27.417
Well, you can go pound sand
if you don't believe me.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.250
Maybe you just misrepresented

29:30.333 --> 29:31.792
how that final talk went.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.583
You ever had a fiancee?

29:40.250 --> 29:42.667
And, uh, she screwed
my head up good.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.625
Well, that's what
Ellie did to me.

29:45.709 --> 29:47.500
So maybe over time,
I wanna remember it

29:47.583 --> 29:49.834
a little different,
you know? Pride thing.

29:49.917 --> 29:51.834
Yeah, well,
you put in the
time.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.792
You're the long-term guy.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.417
And some new act waltzes in,
she goes nutty.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.375
Sure.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.875
You can't talk
to him about it.

29:58.959 --> 30:01.625
What, a rational conversation
with a woman?

30:01.709 --> 30:03.333
I never had one.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.250
Well, you tried,
but two seconds later

30:05.333 --> 30:07.333
they got you frothing
at the mouth, right?

30:08.667 --> 30:11.583
And pretty soon, you got
a mess on your hands.

30:11.667 --> 30:13.000
That how it went, Bud?

30:14.166 --> 30:15.792
You can't have her,
no one can?

30:17.417 --> 30:21.667
Hey, I took it harder
than I said, but come
on!

30:21.750 --> 30:24.208
- I didn't kill her.
- You staked the place out.

30:24.291 --> 30:25.875
I watched for her one night.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.542
- A few nights.
- I heard a week.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.375
So, a week!

30:32.458 --> 30:35.083
Believe me, I
wasn't
the messed-up one.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.417
I went to the door finally,
walked into World War III.

30:53.959 --> 30:55.750
Ellie? Ellie!

30:55.834 --> 30:57.333
[knocking]
Damn it!

30:57.417 --> 30:58.917
Ellie, let me in
there.
Where is he?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.709
- Show me where he is!
- Bud, keep it down.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.917
Look, he is bad
news,
Ellie, I'm telling
you.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.375
Look at you.

31:08.417 --> 31:09.917
Just..

31:10.000 --> 31:12.750
You answer me
one question,
okay?

31:12.834 --> 31:14.208
Are you serious..

31:14.291 --> 31:16.417
...about giving up
19 years in
Fishtown

31:16.500 --> 31:18.333
to run off
with th-this hippie
guy

31:18.417 --> 31:20.083
who you've known
for six weeks?

31:20.166 --> 31:22.875
- You don't understand, Bud--
- Who'd do this to you?

31:28.125 --> 31:30.458
Baby, listen..

31:30.542 --> 31:32.583
...don't
you-don't
you remember

31:32.667 --> 31:34.125
that time we went
down
to Atlantic City

31:34.208 --> 31:37.375
just the four of us,
for beers, and surf and
turf?

31:37.458 --> 31:41.625
Remember, and I-I
went,
I went in the water

31:41.709 --> 31:45.375
and you-you came in,
and you pulled me
out?

31:45.458 --> 31:46.750
Remember that?

31:46.834 --> 31:48.667
I do, Bud, yeah.

31:48.750 --> 31:50.542
So?

31:50.625 --> 31:52.542
So, I'm in love with Warren.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.458
Sorry.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.375
Yeah.

32:00.709 --> 32:02.709
Well, that's screwy.

32:07.417 --> 32:08.667
<i>Adios.</i>

32:21.625 --> 32:23.000
Maybe me and Ellie
weren't perfect

32:23.083 --> 32:24.917
but I never laid a hand.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.333
But Warren did?

32:26.417 --> 32:29.041
He acts like this
peace-lovin' guy.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.667
Not behind closed doors.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.875
So, uh, ever hear
from that New York
guy?

32:38.959 --> 32:42.291
He doesn't know where I am,
which is a good thing.

32:43.542 --> 32:44.667
End badly?

32:44.750 --> 32:47.542
- He got overly invested.
- Mm-hmm.

32:47.625 --> 32:51.417
Like, um, Joe
Dennison,
and..

32:51.500 --> 32:53.583
...Danny Ross.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.917
- Steve Regis?
- I was never with Steve.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.208
- Liar!
- I wasn't.

32:57.291 --> 32:58.792
Hey, I wouldn't
admit
to it either.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.333
There's someone good now.

33:03.417 --> 33:04.959
Yeah, yeah, what about that?

33:06.291 --> 33:07.834
Well..

33:07.917 --> 33:09.709
Actually, he's a cop.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.417
Do I know him?

33:14.542 --> 33:15.709
Yeah.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.917
Not Valens?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.583
I can't believe
you're doing this
again.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.792
- Again?
- I should have guessed.

33:33.875 --> 33:36.000
Valens isn't like Patrick
at all.

33:36.083 --> 33:37.250
Don't talk about him.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.500
I would never do that, Lil.

33:40.959 --> 33:43.041
- 'Cause of how it hurt you--
- Don't you know by now?

33:43.125 --> 33:44.917
You ruin everything you touch?

33:46.333 --> 33:47.709
I don't ruin things.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.875
Happy birthday.

33:59.375 --> 34:01.166
Lil?

34:01.250 --> 34:03.291
I'm leaving for work at 7:00,
you can come by after that

34:03.375 --> 34:04.750
and pick up your stuff.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.208
- Is something wrong?
- Nope.

34:28.291 --> 34:29.500
Let's do this.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.000
I'm back in the cell
in two hours.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.542
- Can't this wait?
- No, it can't, Warren--

34:35.625 --> 34:37.667
I'm starting to believe
you did love Ellie.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.458
I've only been saying
that from the start.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.125
Oh, it's always the
guys
who love too hard

34:41.208 --> 34:43.375
that end up smacking
their girls around.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.208
I never touched her.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.125
There was a witness
outside your apartment.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.500
Heard screamin', violence.

34:49.583 --> 34:50.709
- It wasn't me.
- Oh!

34:50.792 --> 34:52.750
Ellie got her face bloody
all by herself?

34:54.083 --> 34:56.458
I promised her
I'd never tell.

34:56.542 --> 34:59.208
But I guess I've been
keeping promises to a ghost

34:59.291 --> 35:01.625
for a long time now.

35:01.709 --> 35:02.959
So?

35:04.417 --> 35:07.375
It was Brian
yelling in my apartment.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.667
- He the one hurt her?
- He was detoxin'.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.208
Not in his right mind.

35:11.291 --> 35:12.458
With heroin?

35:12.542 --> 35:14.166
A lot of guys
came back with a
habit.

35:14.250 --> 35:17.333
I knew the signs as soon as
I saw Brian at the wedding.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.959
'It was..'

35:19.041 --> 35:20.875
...ugly, you know?

35:20.959 --> 35:24.000
He got so pissed off one night
he threw a plate at Ellie.

35:24.083 --> 35:25.542
'Cut her face.'

35:25.625 --> 35:27.750
Why did you get involved in it?

35:27.834 --> 35:30.709
Ellie wouldn't leave with me
with Brian sick.

35:30.792 --> 35:34.500
The plan was after he got
clean,
Ellie and I would go north.

35:38.375 --> 35:39.625
Take it easy.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.625
You think you can get
Brian home okay?

35:44.709 --> 35:45.959
Mm-hmm.

35:48.625 --> 35:51.959
So, 11:00 tonight?

35:52.041 --> 35:53.250
Warren..

35:54.667 --> 35:55.875
You okay?

35:55.959 --> 35:57.792
I don't know if I can do this.

35:57.875 --> 36:00.125
El, we're all packed.

36:00.208 --> 36:02.542
Your stuff's up
there
ready to go.

36:02.625 --> 36:04.291
I don't think
I can leave my brother.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.000
He's in the clear now.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.542
What if he relapses?

36:07.625 --> 36:09.083
No one else here knows.

36:09.166 --> 36:10.625
He'll be all alone.

36:12.667 --> 36:14.458
What about our plan?

36:16.458 --> 36:18.125
Look at him, Warren.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.750
Do you still love me?

36:26.834 --> 36:29.125
I love you so much.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.583
Then come with me.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.041
You know, you're the first
person to ever tell me

36:34.125 --> 36:35.750
I could be bigger
than this place.

36:35.834 --> 36:37.125
It's true.

36:38.917 --> 36:39.834
Thank you for that.

36:39.917 --> 36:41.083
Baby, don't talk like

36:41.166 --> 36:42.834
you're not coming.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.291
I just need time.

36:44.375 --> 36:47.625
They're picking us up
at 11:00 at the bus
station.

36:47.709 --> 36:51.417
Ellie, I know
what
I'm asking you..

36:52.542 --> 36:54.875
...but it's 'cause I love you.

36:54.959 --> 36:57.959
And if you come tonight..

36:58.041 --> 37:00.417
...I'll love
you
my whole
life.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.750
I know.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.834
And if you don't come

37:05.917 --> 37:07.667
I won't make it hard for you.

37:09.291 --> 37:10.792
I'll let you go.

37:14.959 --> 37:16.959
I'll see you tonight.

37:35.417 --> 37:37.083
I made them wait
until midnight.

37:38.917 --> 37:41.125
Then I waited for
a long time after that

37:41.208 --> 37:44.750
thinking she was gonna
knock on my door one day.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.250
She made a choice.

37:49.333 --> 37:52.291
Well, Brian didn't
say
anything about
this.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.250
Not a great look-back.

37:54.333 --> 37:56.291
Probably the worst time
of his life.

38:05.834 --> 38:08.041
I was just about
to go to sleep.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.166
Graveyard shift?

38:12.250 --> 38:13.709
Uh, it's a good schedule for me.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.750
I could never lay down at night.

38:17.625 --> 38:19.792
Did you wake up
the night Ellie left?

38:19.875 --> 38:21.000
Left where?

38:21.083 --> 38:22.375
The night
she packed her suitcase

38:22.458 --> 38:24.041
left to go to Canada,
did you wake up

38:24.125 --> 38:25.542
'and find her room empty?'

38:25.625 --> 38:27.333
She wasn't going anywhere
with that guy.

38:27.417 --> 38:29.375
Brian, we know
you came back

38:29.458 --> 38:30.875
from the war
with a drug problem.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.542
Lot of guys struggled with that.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.041
Well, that stuff
holds
on tight, Brian.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.375
You can't just
give it up
easy.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.125
So maybe you slipped up

38:38.208 --> 38:39.875
the night Ellie
decides to leave.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.667
(Valens)
'You went to Warren's
to talk her out of it.'

38:41.750 --> 38:44.750
Only you're in such a haze,
you do something you regret.

38:44.834 --> 38:47.625
Something you're just sittin'
on
for all these years.

38:47.709 --> 38:49.875
No, I wouldn't do that.
I got clean.

38:49.959 --> 38:52.625
There was chrome
on her neck, Brian.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.041
- 'From your chair.'
- No!

38:54.125 --> 38:55.667
You got that junk
in your veins

38:55.750 --> 38:57.917
and now, your baby
sister
goes behind your back

38:58.000 --> 39:00.291
'and sneaks off.
You got nobody.'

39:00.375 --> 39:02.750
You're down so
low,
you break.

39:02.834 --> 39:04.250
I was clean..

39:10.041 --> 39:11.625
...when I did it.

39:16.458 --> 39:17.709
Ah, God.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.458
For the first time
in so long..

39:23.041 --> 39:24.208
...I was clear.

39:24.291 --> 39:27.083
I could see right to tomorrow..

39:28.417 --> 39:30.291
...and all the way
down the line.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.667
Brian.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.333
I heard you get up and go.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.500
Ellie, you really
gonna leave me?

39:51.709 --> 39:54.291
I'm sorry
I didn't say
goodbye.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.458
It hurts too much.

39:56.542 --> 39:57.583
So don't.

39:57.667 --> 39:59.208
I love him, Bri.

39:59.291 --> 40:00.834
I wanna start a
life
with him up
there.

40:00.917 --> 40:03.417
While I'm down here
alone in the house?

40:03.500 --> 40:04.625
You're not alone.

40:04.709 --> 40:06.583
Mom and dad are there.
Kate.

40:08.917 --> 40:10.458
No.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.875
What?

40:11.959 --> 40:13.208
She's gone.

40:15.625 --> 40:16.750
El..

40:16.834 --> 40:18.667
...there's not
gonna be anyone for me.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.875
- Sure there is.
- No, I..

40:23.667 --> 40:25.375
I don't work..

40:26.750 --> 40:28.125
...how men do.

40:31.375 --> 40:33.834
Brian, that's
not
what a man is.

40:35.125 --> 40:38.208
It's about who you
are
on the inside.

40:38.291 --> 40:40.750
How you treat
people,
how you love them.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.208
[chuckles]
Oh!

40:44.291 --> 40:46.000
But that's where
it's all rotten.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.166
No.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.041
El, the little girl
who did this..

40:52.625 --> 40:55.083
...she recognized me,
that's why.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.291
Because we went into her hut,
and we dragged out her parents

40:59.375 --> 41:02.166
and her grandparents,
and we threw them in a bunker

41:02.250 --> 41:03.792
and tossed in a grenade.

41:06.291 --> 41:07.709
She finds me later.

41:09.041 --> 41:12.417
So starving,
she's probably 40 pounds wet.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.583
And all I was thinking was..

41:17.208 --> 41:19.166
"...I should have killed her
too."

41:21.834 --> 41:25.291
El, you are the only one
I can tell these things to.

41:30.250 --> 41:33.667
- You're not rotten.
- 'Cause you don't know.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.041
Okay?

41:37.125 --> 41:38.875
Because you get to leave,
and forget

41:38.959 --> 41:41.000
and I am stuck here..

41:42.583 --> 41:45.083
...for the rest of my life.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.417
What about me?

41:49.166 --> 41:50.792
Brian, it's alright.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.709
No, I'm stuck.

41:56.667 --> 41:59.792
Just-just let me-let me..

42:00.542 --> 42:02.208
But I am stuck.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.166
I am stuck!

42:07.166 --> 42:08.458
I am stuck!

42:12.375 --> 42:13.667
I'm stuck.
