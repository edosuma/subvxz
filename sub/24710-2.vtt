what's called your ejection fraction,

actually pumping blood.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.525

Is it a heart attack?

Your first enzyme tests
have come back a little elevated,

18:34.071 --> 18:35.364
so we can't rule that out.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.283
But your other symptoms
don't really point to an infarct.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.078
You're running a degree of temp,
you're a little anemic,

18:41.161 --> 18:43.831

of your white count.

with what your echo shows

infectious or inflammatory process
in your heart

18:57.594 --> 19:00.889
over the next 12 to 72 hours
the extra bloods we've drawn

19:00.973 --> 19:03.100
may help us pinpoint
what we're dealing with.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.685
And then you'd know how to treat it?

19:04.935 --> 19:07.813
With an infection that responds
to antibiotics,

19:07.896 --> 19:09.815

24:12.451 --> 24:14.286

24:20.167 --> 24:22.043
At a family picnic once, my, uh...

24:22.836 --> 24:24.880
uncle was so short of breath,
he went blue.

24:25.630 --> 24:29.009
Well, we took him to the hospital,
and it turned out he was asthmatic.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.093
(SIGHS)

24:30.594 --> 24:32.512
I know, asthma can get you
real short of breath.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.514
Yeah, but how late in life
can that come on?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.517
I think what James is trying to say
is that you can have it since youth, Andy,

24:37.601 --> 24:38.602
and not know.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.104
You don't know it's asthma,
but you know you got something.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.816
This what Simone's got is
some sudden, fresh onset.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.110
You don't get suddenly asthma that late.

24:48.361 --> 24:51.406
The M.E. put the .22 slug in the victim
and two .38's in the perp.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.285
The two .38's matches Walsh's weapon.
He only hit the perp.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.246
We got maybe somebody we like
for that perp's running buddy.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.583
The, uh, DOA perp had six collars.

25:02.417 --> 25:06.171
Uh. One of his accomplices had a ponytail.
This Ricky Rodriguez was bailed out

25:06.254 --> 25:09.966

-Police surgeon?
-Let's talk over here.

Lieutenant, do you really
want the borough chief knowing

25:30.403 --> 25:31.988
you brought the police surgeon over here,

25:32.489 --> 25:35.742

-to the job that that entails?

and that he behaved responsibly?

25:42.999 --> 25:45.377
'Cause I got to tell you, lieutenant,
this is looking to shake out

25:45.460 --> 25:46.878
that Walsh's shots were good.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.464
The M.E. says that Walsh's bullets
were only in the perp.

25:50.006 --> 25:54.177
Every day, I got a period of time
in my tour called "the Walsh hour,"

25:54.386 --> 25:55.845
worrying how that guy's gonna screw me up.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.098
So, why don't you put
the police surgeon on hold,

25:58.473 --> 26:01.476
go back to your squad, stand by,
and if Walsh turns out derelict

26:01.601 --> 26:04.938
or irresponsible, I'll call,
and you can come crucify him.

26:05.772 --> 26:08.900

that rake left a bullet in your arm.

I got an old bullet in my arm
from a previous incident.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.417
-This is a cagey guy.
-You better hope that old bullet

27:49.501 --> 27:51.294
came from the gun
shot you last night, Ricky.

-Hey, half-wit, you were shot by a cop.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.384

right here in this room,

against the cop's weapon,

you will have two homicides

how come you put me in the main event?

30:04.177 --> 30:07.263
-No, this can do him nothing but good.
-I mean, when Larry got into trouble,

30:07.680 --> 30:09.182
I didn't go running out to help.

He could have kept on
with his own business, this Mike.

but it was him got killed

30:18.566 --> 30:19.776
in that parking lot.

30:19.859 --> 30:23.029
So, Mike the cop hears trouble outside
and goes and sees what's up?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.740
Well, he trips and falls on his face
running out, pulling his pants up.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.701
-You were watching from where?
-Out the trailer window.

30:29.869 --> 30:33.039
While Mike's running,
Larry's struggling with a Latino,

30:33.248 --> 30:36.042
who I am sure
is one of the two greaseballs

30:36.125 --> 30:38.086
that's been taking off our tricks.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.967
-Sorry.
-Hey, I'm okay.

Anyways, Larry gets dropped,
and Latino One turns to shoot Mike.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.852
-Latino One as opposed to who?
-As opposed to the second Latino

30:54.102 --> 30:56.479
who comes from between the parked cars
with another gun.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.524
Then, after Mike drops the Latino
that shot Larry,

30:59.858 --> 31:01.317
he takes two shots at this other one,

31:01.776 --> 31:02.902
and I think he winged him,

31:03.570 --> 31:05.029

(EXHALES)

34:49.420 --> 34:52.799
I'll tell ya, Andy's always goin'
for that black-cloud scenario.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.967
That gets a little old for me sometimes.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.471
Hey, James, Marie's first cousin

34:58.971 --> 35:02.183
enters the hospital
with exactly Bobby's symptoms.

35:02.683 --> 35:07.063
Released four days later in perfect health
after I.V. antibiotics.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.191
It just happens Andy's a worrier.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.903
All I'm saying, for me personally,
that negativity gets old.

35:15.863 --> 35:17.740
-What'd that whore say?
-Walsh was bangin' her

35:17.824 --> 35:19.909
when the trouble started,
then he went outside to help.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.327
You put any of that on paper?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.621
You think you're the only cop
in the squad

35:23.704 --> 35:24.914
that knows how to do this job, Andy?

35:26.415 --> 35:27.625
What's your problem?

35:29.585 --> 35:33.214
No, I didn't put it on paper
so as not to get Walsh in trouble.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.767
See, that's the other side
of Andy, though, James,

35:45.977 --> 35:47.186
putting himself out...

35:47.812 --> 35:50.648
trying to keep this boss
from hurting Walsh.

35:51.774 --> 35:53.776
All I'm saying
is I'm worried about Bobby too.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.362
Yeah. No...

35:57.822 --> 35:58.823
no question.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.247
The second guy you hit's a collar,
and he gave it up.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.040
So I come up right, Andy?

36:08.374 --> 36:10.585
You got a whore puts you banging her
when this went down.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.962
Oh. Oh, my God.

36:13.045 --> 36:15.298
-That's not going in the fives.
-Yeah?

36:15.715 --> 36:17.758
'Cause, uh, my boss
gets ahold of that, it's the river.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.552
ANDY: Let me speak my piece, Walsh.

36:20.094 --> 36:24.056
That's not going in the fives, and my boss
kept the police surgeon out of it.

36:24.307 --> 36:28.186
Oh, believe me, I... I'm gonna thank him,
I mean, your entire squad.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.486
I know what I'm saying now,
'cause we're the same kind of drunk.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.157
You got no shot working
and keeping drinking.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.452
Our cases are too advanced,
and when something happens

36:44.535 --> 36:47.747
like outside that diner,
we don't know enough to hide.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.543
-These shootings came up good, Andy.
-Yeah, yeah, these came up good,

36:52.627 --> 36:54.795
and you still got a boss
looking to hang you.

36:55.087 --> 36:58.090
And tomorrow night or the night after,
when you go out and you got your load on,

36:58.299 --> 37:00.259
maybe the next squad
don't look to shield you.

37:02.929 --> 37:06.015
Yeah. (EXHALES) Yeah, food for thought.

-Is it an attack?

37:33.584 --> 37:37.129
-Uh... I'm inferring they don't think so.
-Off what, Medavoy?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.882
Shh, shh. Um. Is he up to visitors?

37:40.466 --> 37:42.593
It's a cardiac unit. Probably only family.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.932
-off the boss' half.
-Not a heart attack?

37:48.516 --> 37:50.434
-GREG: That's my inference.
-And they can cure that?

37:50.935 --> 37:54.313
-Uh. The boss is rackin' positive.
-And you hear of that attitude before?

37:54.730 --> 37:56.565

and good thoughts.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.194

-I'll tell him.
-Who's she talking about?

38:03.155 --> 38:04.448
Yeah, take care, Diane.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.410
(SIGHS)

38:07.618 --> 38:09.537
Well, Diane says the doctor thinks

38:09.620 --> 38:12.039
it's much more likely to be an infection
than a heart attack.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.126
-Meaning what?
-I'm telling you what she told me, Andy.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.671
There's sore throats and bubonic plague.
What nature infection is it?

38:18.796 --> 38:20.589
It may take time till they know that.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.843
Diane says it will take about three days
for the blood tests to come back.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.386
And what was that last part?

38:26.012 --> 38:27.138
You know, just that, um,

38:27.346 --> 38:29.598
she and Bobby appreciated you
bringing him over.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.017
She don't want to talk to me?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.436
Oh, you figure she'd probably want
to get back to Bobby.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.562
Yeah.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.189
Hey, I... I...
I think we can all count our blessings.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.317

38:39.859 --> 38:42.194
something like what my, uh,
ex-wife's cousin had,

38:42.278 --> 38:43.946

with a clean bill of health.

to get home right away,

see Bobby, you know,

39:15.478 --> 39:16.771
then take her home.

You let me to look like half a jerk
before you tell me?

No. No, I thought I'd take into account
other people not being asked,

39:26.405 --> 39:27.740
and they might have feelings too.
