00:02.587 --> 00:03.827
Audrey Parker?

00:03.921 --> 00:05.297
Haven PD. Who are you?

00:08.092 --> 00:10.083
I know her. Drop the gun!

00:10.469 --> 00:12.460
There are things in this town
that I can't explain.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.212
-Me neither.
-But there is no way

00:14.307 --> 00:15.922
that I have your memories.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.428
People like me, we're different.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.645
For some reason, I understand these people
and I can help them.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.473
-You seriously can't feel pain?
-No.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.275

00:28.362 --> 00:30.478
DUKE: Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.154
-Chief.
-l'm sorry about this, Nathan.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.483
Dad.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.493
My dad was holding it all together.

AUDREY 1: That's yourjob now.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.124
The death of the Chief was a shock to us all.

00:46.297 --> 00:51.667
But I want to thank you all for the support
you've shown me over the past few days.

00:52.386 --> 00:56.629
My father always said Haven
is more than just a town. It's a family.

00:57.350 --> 01:00.683
And I appreciate you all coming here today.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.135
Thank you.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.686
-Chief would be proud.
-Very nice.

01:08.819 --> 01:09.808
Thank you.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.363
I hate public speaking.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.493
Yeah, well, now I know why.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.615
Thanks for coming, Beattie.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.916
Yeah, I'm glad the memorial was today.

01:26.671 --> 01:29.003
Yesterday l was a little tied up.

01:29.715 --> 01:30.830
Thanks.

-Hey, Nathan.
-lan.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.681
Your dad looked out for me
a couple of times.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.925
Least I could do, right?

01:39.183 --> 01:40.389
You seen Duke around?

01:40.518 --> 01:41.724
Maybe check his boat.

01:41.936 --> 01:45.224
Yeah, right, will do. Thanks, and... Sorry.

03:46.811 --> 03:48.972
I'm gonna have to start putting vodka
in my soda.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.189
At least it's not tequila.

When your Agent Howard was here,
who else did he talk to?

04:21.512 --> 04:24.549
Chief. Nathan. Duke.

04:25.975 --> 04:30.344
We were on his boat for a while,
so may be worth a shot to talk to him.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.054
Your Agent Howard can't hide forever.

I haven't seen anything like it since Iraq.

No, I didn't see anything.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.087

for no reason.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.424
And you didn't pass anyone on your way in?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.263
No. Well, I came to see my girlfriend
through the back,

05:50.392 --> 05:53.225
because she usually starts at that time.
But she wasn't there.

you right now...

06:34.144 --> 06:36.556

but yeah, I could feel it.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.512

since the fifth grade.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.100

I'm gonna go back to the station,
go through the Chief's files,

07:43.547 --> 07:45.708
see if anything like this
has happened before.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.462

with a rational explanation

07:49.553 --> 07:51.384
for the things that happen
in this crazy town.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.969
I'd love to hear what you come up with.

07:53.057 --> 07:55.548
Well, Haven could be some kind of a test site.

07:55.893 --> 07:59.260
Or maybe a pharmaceutical company's
been illegally dumping drugs.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.638
You know, you should take a soil sample.
Water, too.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.896
That's actually not a bad idea.
If I start with the water...

08:08.781 --> 08:09.896
Oh, you're humoring me.

any charters right now.

One trip. For old time's sake.

you screwing up and me posting bail.

I can pay cash up front.

09:34.658 --> 09:35.943
If you can pay,

09:37.536 --> 09:38.696
then ask Buck.

I'll give you a chance to think it over.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.785
It was my fifth grade carnival.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.573
There was this funhouse
and the older girls made me go in.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.241
And then he just came out of nowhere.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.951
It was just this stupid clown, but...

11:07.084 --> 11:10.872
But it's the scariest thing
I've ever seen in my entire life. Ever.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.423
Wait, that...

11:17.094 --> 11:19.881
That's what people are seeing
when they see this girl.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.429
Whatever or whoever scares them the most.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.930
That would line up with a report I found.

11:27.062 --> 11:32.056
A guy named Bob Taylor barricaded himself
in his house for two days.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.981
He said Bigfoot was after him.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.318
Well, that would make sense
with what was happening today.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.028
But if it's this girl
and Taylor saw her a month ago,

11:39.116 --> 11:40.447
where's she been all this time?

11:40.951 --> 11:43.488
Why haven't we heard reports
of other people being affected?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.485
And why weren't you affected?

11:46.790 --> 11:50.658
I don't know. I'm just usually not.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.752
We need to find her
before anyone else gets hurt.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.792
Hey, Vince.

11:57.301 --> 12:00.509
I'm going to go talk to Vince, see if he can
draw up a sketch of the girl I saw.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.502
Somebody in town should recognize her.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.599
-You coming?
-No!

12:05.142 --> 12:08.976
I think maybe I need to take
a little break from the clowns.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.639
-C|owns, huh?
-Don't forget. You can feel pain now.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.814

No!

from taking a swim.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.160
I got the cash.
Enough to make this trip worth your while.

I told you I'm into something big.
It's all different for me now.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.826
Yet your spiffy wardrobe remains the same.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.339
Not for long. Everything's gonna change.
You'll see.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.834
Want to tell me what kind of con
you're running here?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.591
You won't regret it. I promise.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.098
No deal.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.681
Vice Principal Dolores Bachman.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.684
That was a sympathy... Never mind.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.685
lan, that is the last time you get to use that.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.483
Of course. I never would have even
mentioned it. But I got to get north.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.530
Tomorrow, right?

13:05.494 --> 13:06.654
Yeah.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.951
Is she here because of you?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.123
What do you mean? Who is she?

13:14.211 --> 13:15.667
She's an FBI agent.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.708
Look, just take off.
I'll find out what she knows.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.968
Send my best to the bishop.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.134
And say hi to Sister Catherine for me.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.551
Not the tattooed man, I gather.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.890
| Wish.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.384
Ian, I can handle.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.888
But you know I sure would be happier
if you were out there looking for him.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.724
Well, the guy that you saw wasn't real.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.902
-Excuse me?
-Apparently some girl is causing people

13:42.990 --> 13:45.151
to hallucinate
whatever they're most afraid of.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.357
I hate myself for saying that.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.070
No, don't. That's fantastic. I mean...

13:51.873 --> 13:53.488
That's great news.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.199
So you're saying I imagined him.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.246
-Yeah.
-Thank you. You have a nice day.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.422
Uh, Duke. Don't thank me.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.253
Help me.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.179
I need to find Audrey's bogus Agent Howard.
She said he was here?

14:09.266 --> 14:11.257
Yeah. And he spent most of his time
with Audrey.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.842
I was dealing with my own...

14:15.772 --> 14:16.852
Situation.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.932
Well, did he say where he was going next
or was he staying in town?

14:20.068 --> 14:21.228
Did he have a rental car?

14:21.611 --> 14:22.771
No.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.900
I don't know. I don't know.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.363
Come on, Duke. You're an observant guy.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.779
There was a government agent on my boat.
I wasn't trying to bond with him.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.535
I was just trying to get rid of him.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.044
Speaking of which.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.708
Nice try.

14:40.297 --> 14:43.039
But I'm thinking I'm gonna be pretty hard
to get rid of, too.

14:43.592 --> 14:47.961
Yeah. Me and the 20 or so coast guard agents
I could have here by the end of the day.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.298
Wow.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.921
You're kind of sexy when you're threatening.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.219
Maybe my security cameras got something.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.976
See, I knew you were a security-conscious
kind of guy.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.900
I'm a safety guy. Come on. This way.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.081
Here's our girl.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.416
-Don't recognize her.
-Neither does Vince.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.914
No one at the bus station remembers her

15:22.005 --> 15:24.337
even though they would've been staring
right at her.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.133
And that's because they weren't seeing her.
They were seeing their fears.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.587
Well, if she's the source, we may have a lead.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.637
Guess who was a witness
to Bob's attack on his wife, Bigfoot?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.680
Brian Shaw.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.937
AUDREY 1: Kid from the grocery store?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.309
Mmm-hmm.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.854
He was there looking for his girlfriend.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.519
I hope he's still looking.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.121
You hacked into the entire marina?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.957
(IN FOREIGN ACCENT)
I only use my powers for good.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.206
(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Mostly.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.206
Right. Wait a minute. Is that him?

16:07.717 --> 16:10.003
-Yep. That's him.
-Can you blow it up?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.801
Let me see what I can do.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.808
Looks like Chief Wuornos and Howard
were having a little powwow.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.385
AUDREY 2: Agent Howard, huh?

16:20.063 --> 16:22.395
It's hard to tell about what, though.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.731
Yeah, but it's someplace for me to start.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.728
Thank you. I owe you one.

16:30.574 --> 16:31.905
I'll remember that.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.991
All right. Jackie Clark. 181 Seekonk Street.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.825
She works morning shifts
at the grocery store,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.421
and the clerk said that she didn't show.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.208
But why did this all start today?

16:54.097 --> 16:57.430
Did you know the skin on your lips
is the most sensitive on your entire body?

16:57.893 --> 16:59.508
Okay, you're kinda starting to weird me out.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.687
Still getting used to this whole feeling thing.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.229
Back when you...

17:08.445 --> 17:09.730
...kissed my cheek,

17:10.405 --> 17:13.772
that was the first time in years
that I had felt another person's touch.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.451
I hope you didn't feel too weird about it.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.284
Why would I feel weird?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.078
Exactly.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.917
Jackie, I know you're in there.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.294
Come on, open the door.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.684
Jackie, jeez.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.307
Where've you been?
I've been worried about you.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.898
This isn't a good time, Brian.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.560
-What's wrong?
-You have to go away.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.811
I can't see you anymore.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.392
Are you mad at me? Did I do something?

17:50.487 --> 17:51.897
I can't explain it to you.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.196
-You just have to go.
-No, you're not breaking up with me again

17:55.283 --> 17:56.864
without telling me why.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.786
Okay, I love you.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.201
And I know you love me.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.617
-Brian, please.
-No, we're gonna talk about this.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.619
Brian, I don't think this is a good idea.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.995
Brian, you shouldn't.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.459
BRIAN: Jackie!

18:08.546 --> 18:10.411
(BRIAN SCREAMING)

18:14.636 --> 18:15.796
AUDREY 1: The door's open.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.517
Haven PD.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.311
Brian? Put it down.

18:39.703 --> 18:40.943
Brian, it's...

18:41.037 --> 18:42.823
It's gonna be okay, all right?

18:43.707 --> 18:46.198
-Are you hurt?
-No, it's not me. It was a burglar.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.793
It was just like when I was kid,
except this time I stopped him.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.873
-And I stabbed him.
-Okay.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.210
Brian, tell me exactly what happened.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.378
Uh, well, I came here to see Jackie, but...

18:57.220 --> 18:59.552
There was a guy in the house.
So I grabbed the knife...

19:00.056 --> 19:01.842
It's clear. She's not here.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.057
Where's Jackie?

19:04.728 --> 19:06.138
Brian, I need you to listen to me.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.720
Has Jackie been acting strangely?

19:08.857 --> 19:13.567
Well, a few months or so ago,
after her dad died, she had some problems.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.059
Problems?

19:15.572 --> 19:17.654
She wouldn't tell me what they were.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.481
But we broke up
'cause she said she needed space.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.658
But a few weeks ago, we got back together.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.485
And things have been fine since.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.739
We think that Jackie might have an...

19:28.084 --> 19:29.494
Have an affliction.

19:29.878 --> 19:33.416
That when people look at her,
they see something that's not there.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.833
Whatever frightens them.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.592
That was Jackie?

19:40.430 --> 19:44.514
No, no, no. No, I'd never hurt her.
No, I love her.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.015
Okay, I need you to think.

19:46.102 --> 19:50.015
All right, Jackie is out there somewhere
and she's hurt. So where would she go?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.930
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

19:56.404 --> 19:58.941
There's a madman inside my house.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.359
It's okay, ma'am. Stay here.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.615
Are you sure?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.378
Jackie?

20:14.422 --> 20:15.798
Jackie, are you here?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.095
Got more blood here.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.306
Listen, we know you're hurt.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.301
JACKIE: ljust needed some bandages.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.647
Mrs. McCarthy was supposed to be at work.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.149
Tell her I'm sorry.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.563
We just... We want to help.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.145
No one can help me.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.825
Just leave me alone!

20:46.830 --> 20:48.240
Are you okay?

20:48.331 --> 20:50.447
-Go after her. Go after her!
-No, what did you see?

20:52.293 --> 20:53.829
-No, Jackie!
-Stop!

20:54.337 --> 20:55.998
Before I hurt you, too.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.421
You're not gonna hurt me. I promise.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.128
Just look at me, Jackie.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.502
Look at me. It's gonna be okay.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.676
See? Nothing scary.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.530
I've lived in this town my whole life,

21:24.659 --> 21:28.948
and I always heard about weird things
happening to people, but I...

21:29.289 --> 21:31.154
Well, when did it all start for you?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.622
After my father died,

21:34.377 --> 21:37.369
one of the neighbors came over
with this stupid casserole.

21:38.548 --> 21:42.291
I opened the door and she got hysterical.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.717
And itjust kept happening.

21:44.846 --> 21:48.179
Like, people would see terrible things
when I looked at them.

21:49.726 --> 21:54.220
And then a couple weeks ago,
it just went away.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.554
And everything was normal again.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.310
What were you doing when it stopped?

21:58.693 --> 22:00.979
lwas hiding in Bangor,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.982
and this guy attacked me.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.068
Slashed me with a knife.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.243
And this woman ran up to help me
and when she looked at me,

22:11.206 --> 22:12.491
she didn't freak out.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.539
No one did.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.742
So, I came home, I made up with Brian.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.166
Everything was okay until this morning.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.093
I just want to be normal again.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.382
Be with Brian.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.928
We were so happy and now it's all ruined.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.431
It's not ruined.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.770
-Don't look at me.
-Jackie, I'm sorry.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.185
I thought all this curse stuff was crap.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.732
And now that you know it's not?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.775
I don't care. I still love her.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.948
Come on.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.324
And the number only appears once?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.618
You're sure?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.665
Okay, text me if you get a street address.

23:04.008 --> 23:08.126
So, this girl, she's one of them?

23:08.346 --> 23:10.758
She's troubled. Yes.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.977
So, did Duke give you anything on Howard?

23:15.103 --> 23:18.937
Howard had a talk with Chief Wuornos
after he left Duke's boat.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.230
ljust pulled up the Chief's phone records.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.024
And, naturally, you asked Nathan first?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.778
The Chief made a 20 minute call
to an unknown number

23:27.865 --> 23:29.605
the day that Howard was in town.

23:30.618 --> 23:31.994
I'm waiting for a trace on the address.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.657
Well, when you get that, you wait for me.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.842
-Jackie okay?
-Yeah, for now.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.721
Something strange is going on.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.309
Bold statement.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.224
Do you know that Jackie
spent the last couple weeks

23:57.353 --> 23:59.469
thinking that she had been cured
of her trouble?

23:59.856 --> 24:00.936
Sounds familiar.

24:01.024 --> 24:05.063
Yeah. And her affliction
returned just this morning.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.643
When I lost mine.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.318
So, what's the connection?

24:11.409 --> 24:14.572
Right before her affliction disappeared,
she was attacked.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.864
This guy cut her.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.535
Maybe that's what happened to you.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.541
This? You think someone cut me,

24:22.670 --> 24:25.537
someone who can steal
other people's afflictions

24:25.673 --> 24:28.255
by touching their blood.
Who would want mine?

24:28.384 --> 24:30.841
I mean, who would want to go around
not being able to feel anything?

25:14.889 --> 25:15.924
(GLASS SHATTERS)

25:18.267 --> 25:21.509
Night watchman is on his rounds.
He came in here, checked the room,

25:21.604 --> 25:23.105
found they'd been robbed.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.763
But none of the perimeter alarms
were tripped.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.984
So, the thief had to have
come in through here.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.235
-It's a damn tight squeeze.
-Sounds painful.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.827
Not if he couldn't feel it.

25:39.831 --> 25:43.824
This had to be the same guy
who took my affliction.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.289
The only thing that was taken

25:47.422 --> 25:50.505
was this 18th century
children's puzzle board.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.963
Hardly seems worth
not ever being able to feel again.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.549
I've been thinking about that.

25:59.809 --> 26:03.222
If Jackie's affliction came back
when he took mine,

26:03.688 --> 26:05.644
maybe he can only hold one at a time.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.188
Which means that yours can come back?

26:07.316 --> 26:10.308
If he touches another
troubled person's blood, yeah.

26:10.695 --> 26:12.902
Okay, but why the elaborate plan?

26:14.323 --> 26:17.861
According to the curator,
this is just a piece of Haven folk art.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.985
Doesn't even have all of its pieces.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.570
What could it really be worth?

26:26.210 --> 26:30.579
CHILD: # One, two, buckle my shoe

26:30.673 --> 26:35.042
# Three, four, shut the door

26:35.344 --> 26:36.925
# Five, six... #

26:40.057 --> 26:41.922
# Seven, eight...

26:44.395 --> 26:46.260
# Nine, ten... #

27:01.037 --> 27:02.447
NATHAN: The ash isn't even warm.

27:04.207 --> 27:07.791
(SIGHS) It would take a fire days
to reduce a building to this.

27:09.545 --> 27:13.129
So if it didn't burn down,
it had to be something else.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.542
What I don't get is,
what the hell this has to do

27:17.637 --> 27:19.298
with everything else that's been happening.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.548
I know.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.303
There were people inside.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.273
What could have done this?

27:33.402 --> 27:34.938
We need to talk.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.237
Tristram Carver,

27:38.324 --> 27:41.737
sent away by his family
on a colony ship to live in Haven

27:42.495 --> 27:44.031
as an indentured servant.

27:44.121 --> 27:47.613
Always resented the town
he saw as a prison.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.082
So this puzzle belonged to him.

27:50.253 --> 27:55.839
Story was, he made it, imbuing his hatred
for the town into every piece.

27:56.259 --> 27:58.591
And when he was finally able to assemble it,

27:58.970 --> 28:00.460
buildings started to fall.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.678
So, The Troubles have been here
since the beginning?

28:02.765 --> 28:06.758
Yeah. His caretakers
took the puzzle from him.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.269
-They wanted to destroy it.
-But they couldn't.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.142
Not without destroying the town.

28:12.275 --> 28:15.438
That's right.
Instead they scattered the pieces.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.018
All these years,

28:17.113 --> 28:20.196
the puzzle board sat in the museum,
harmless.

28:20.825 --> 28:24.534
The town elders came to believe
it was just folklore.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.403
But it wasn't. And now someone has it.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.999
And knows how to use it.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.624
You know who'd love to get their hands
on this is Reverend Driscoll.

28:32.503 --> 28:35.745
Hold it up to his followers as proof
that the troubled are dangerous and evil.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.876
-Does he know about this?
-I doubt it.

28:38.718 --> 28:41.130
The secret was very well kept
with the family.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.302
Yet you knew about it.

28:44.307 --> 28:48.425
Well, I'm a very good researcher.

28:48.519 --> 28:49.804
Uh-huh.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.470
We need to talk to the Carvers.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.055
The whole family died out.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.521
There hasn't been a Carver
in Haven in almost 50 years.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.939
You said the puzzle pieces were scattered.

29:00.031 --> 29:01.521
Do you know where
they might have ended up?

29:15.004 --> 29:16.335
(GROANS)

29:18.424 --> 29:19.709
Damn it!

29:19.926 --> 29:21.382
We're ready to go, right?

29:21.761 --> 29:22.841
Ian, wait!

29:24.221 --> 29:25.882
What? You said you'd be ready.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.679
(STUTTERING) Yeah. I thought I was.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.395
But, I actually got to do something
before we leave.

29:34.523 --> 29:38.266
Duke, come on, man. I paid you.
I got a schedule. Don't mess with me, man.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.188
-What's going on, Ian?
-We had a deal.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.524
We still have a deal.
And we're going, just like I said.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.368
ljust...

29:50.039 --> 29:51.199
I need a new dial.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.375
For my nav console.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.413
-You recall the one I had broke?
-Yeah. Right.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.627
So, I got to go pick up another one. Okay?

29:59.048 --> 30:01.539
Well, hurry it up, right?
I don't want to go without you.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.425
Well, fortunately for me,
you can't drive this thing.

30:06.889 --> 30:10.177
Two weeks ago, there was a robbery
at a folk art museum in Maryland.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.223
The thief got away when a riot broke out.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.056
Terrified people turning on each other.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.684
He used Jackie's affliction
to gather the puzzle pieces,

30:17.775 --> 30:19.140
and yours to take the board.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.112
Did I hear right?

30:22.738 --> 30:25.775
An entire building just disappeared?

30:27.159 --> 30:29.195
I can't wait to hear
how you're going to contain this.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.277
Well, we may not have anything
left to contain

30:31.414 --> 30:33.245
if we can't find out who's doing this.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.291
All right.
So, I had Stan go through the family trees

30:37.420 --> 30:40.878
that Vince gave us to see
what families married in with the Carvers.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.757
Came up with Elliot, Robbins, Haskell...

30:44.844 --> 30:46.675
Ian Haskell. He was at the memorial.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.425
He shook my hand.
He must have had a razor blade hidden there

30:50.516 --> 30:51.926
and used it to cut me.

30:52.435 --> 30:53.675
Hey, um...

30:55.021 --> 30:58.058
-| just saw the weirdest thing.
-Ian Haskell. Where is he?

30:58.190 --> 31:01.023
Okay, that's really weird, too,
because that's what I came here to tell you.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.190
Um...

31:02.278 --> 31:05.486
-He can't feel pain.
-Did he mention anything about a puzzle?

31:05.573 --> 31:06.938
What?

31:07.033 --> 31:10.070
I'm sorry, did you not hear what ljust said?
He cannot feel pain.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.652
NATHAN: Duke, the puzzle. This is serious.

31:12.747 --> 31:17.741
Okay. Puzzle. Let's talk about puzzles.
Um, no, he didn't mention a puzzle,

31:17.835 --> 31:19.917
but he did ask me to take him to Canada.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.084
Where is he now?

31:22.131 --> 31:23.837
He's waiting for me on my boat.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.167
I'm calling harbor patrol.
We can't let him get out of Haven.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.593
No, that's going to take too long.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.386
They can have the harbor shut down
in 20 minutes.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.715
Okay. Can we just get him off my boat?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.345
AUDREY 2: Do you want me to come?

31:35.436 --> 31:38.348
No, actually. You should stay here.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.680
If this goes bad, we could use outside help.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.391
You're FBI. They might believe you.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.488
I'm sorry. Time out.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.989
Ian's not seriously dangerous.

31:52.328 --> 31:53.408
Is he?

31:58.292 --> 31:59.873
Come on. Come on.

32:00.377 --> 32:03.369
Harbor patrol's standing by.
Let's take this slow.

32:04.215 --> 32:05.580
The puzzle's on my boat.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.629
Ian had a bag with him.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.256
The puzzle's probably in there.

32:11.347 --> 32:12.837
This stuff ain't so hard.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.797
Hey, yeah, but we gotta be careful
about how we get it.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.302
We still don't know how it works.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.179
And remember, he still has your affliction,

32:18.270 --> 32:21.103
-so don't touch him.
-It's not really about me anymore.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.486
-Ian!
-Drop your gun or the kid gets it!

32:33.577 --> 32:36.114
-No, don't hurt him.
-We just wanted to talk to him.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.991
Make him take Jackie's curse away again.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.538
Just shut up!

32:39.750 --> 32:41.251
Inside. Start the boat.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.826
And you got 30 seconds to get off,
or I'll do it. lwill.

32:43.921 --> 32:47.209
I'll shoot Brian right in the head.
And then I'll crush this whole town.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.008
Ian, knock this crap off!

32:55.099 --> 32:57.385
-Give us the puzzle!
-Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

32:57.685 --> 32:58.925
What are you doing?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.391
-What happened to you?
-You mean why...

33:02.481 --> 33:05.723
Why am I not a loser anymore?
Not a big joke?

33:06.235 --> 33:08.100
The Troubles came back,
that's what happened. And now...

33:08.195 --> 33:12.188
Now people have to take me seriously.
Now I get my payback.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.365
You wanted revenge, you got it.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.238
-People died today.
-That building was just a taste.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.874
Once we're at sea, I'm gonna wipe
this whole freaking town off the map.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.619
Anyone who ever messed with me.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.371
-Made fun of me.
-No!

33:24.461 --> 33:25.712
(GUN FIRES)

33:25.796 --> 33:26.876
Watch !

33:29.508 --> 33:30.748
I can't even feel it.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.711
I was doing you a solid, man.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.300
You would've been with me, safe.

33:37.391 --> 33:38.756
(GUN SHOT)

33:45.065 --> 33:46.521
(GASPING) I still can't feel it.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.766
Don't talk. Nathan!

33:49.069 --> 33:51.401
I need an ambulance at the Cape Rouge now.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.532
Okay, here, don't touch him.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.406
We don't want your affliction to come back.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.536
It's here.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.832
If he dies
while he still has Nathan's affliction,

34:14.678 --> 34:16.964
then that means Nathan will be cured, right?

34:18.140 --> 34:19.220
What?

34:19.516 --> 34:22.974
He wanted to evaporate the whole town,
I'm supposed to worry about his feelings?

34:23.062 --> 34:25.178
I say you make your bed, you lie in it.

34:28.108 --> 34:31.817
You could still do something good.
This may be your last chance.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.356
Will you take Nathan's affliction?
Do you know?

34:39.161 --> 34:40.241
(GASPS)

34:40.329 --> 34:43.412
Yeah. Happy ending, right?

34:54.718 --> 34:55.833
Wait, Nathan!

35:00.015 --> 35:01.095
Nathan.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.960
(SOBBING)

35:35.050 --> 35:36.301
Jackie.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.634
Look at me.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.630
It's okay.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.605
You have beautiful eyes.

36:02.453 --> 36:04.535
It's gone. You're okay now.

36:25.768 --> 36:28.510
This is the address
that Howard called the chief from?

36:28.604 --> 36:31.596
Yeah. The phone was disconnected
the next day.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.608
Who knows how long Howard was in Haven
and I never knew about it.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.191
Unstake My Heart.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.531
-This is mine.
-Or it could be mine.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.240
No.

36:52.795 --> 36:54.956
This is the exact same copy
that Howard took from me

36:55.089 --> 36:56.920
before I came to Haven. See?

36:57.466 --> 36:59.081
Page is still turned down.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.637
That isn't an accident. He left that for me.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.556
He left this for us.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.640
But how could he know we'd come here?

37:22.866 --> 37:24.652
We knew Ian our whole lives.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.697
I'm not gonna miss him.

37:28.372 --> 37:30.203
He was tired of being a misfit.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.535
Like the original boy.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.993
It must've taken Ian years
to find all these pieces.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.914
It's hard to believe he did it alone.

37:41.510 --> 37:44.468
Could be someone else out there
with a stake in this.

37:44.555 --> 37:46.261
Yeah, well.

37:46.348 --> 37:49.181
We'll make sure
no one finds the pieces this time.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.678
Uh, excuse me.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.600
What exactly are you guys going to do
with them?

37:52.896 --> 37:55.273
-We know somewhere safe.
-DUKE: Yeah.

37:55.357 --> 37:58.599
As a fairly upstanding citizen of Haven,

37:59.528 --> 38:02.486
I'm gonna need a little more
of an answer than "somewhere safe."

38:02.573 --> 38:05.064
Oh, that's completely understandable.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.031
Duke.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.789
Thanks for helping us out.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.621
I told you, ljust...

38:17.296 --> 38:18.752
...wanted Ian off my boat.

38:21.717 --> 38:24.049
Found out Julia Carr went back to Africa.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.633
She's scared of this town.
I don't think she's the only one.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.764
You know, in my experience,

38:33.562 --> 38:38.727
when people are scared,
they either run or they fight.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.067
I'd start planning for both.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.094
Back at the bus station,

39:14.353 --> 39:17.436
that person that you thought you saw,

39:18.106 --> 39:20.313
your worst fear, was it Lucy?

39:22.653 --> 39:23.938
No.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.365
I wish it was.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.278
I'm sorry.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.036
No, you're not.

39:46.301 --> 39:50.795
So, the book you found at Howard's,
what do you think it means?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.171
I'm not sure.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.299
But I know that it means
we're on the right track.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.851
How much about Haven
do you think Howard knows?

39:58.188 --> 39:59.894
That's a good question.

40:00.399 --> 40:04.142
I think the better question is,
why did he bring me here?

40:07.573 --> 40:09.734
Hey, that was really amazing
what you did today.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.365
(DISMISSINGLY) Ah.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.869
Not every day you can help
save an entire town.

40:15.998 --> 40:18.080
Although it is happening more often lately.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.032
You know what I meant.

40:23.005 --> 40:27.169
My affliction's tough to live with,
but Jackie's is impossible.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.835
I mean, I can live a normal life mostly.

40:32.514 --> 40:34.050
She'd never be able to.

40:34.516 --> 40:35.847
Still...

40:36.768 --> 40:39.510
Troubles went away before.
They'll go away again. I can...

40:40.188 --> 40:41.519
...wait.
