00:04.437 --> 00:07.941
- If there was ever a time for
us to show our teeth, it's now.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.943

00:10.009 --> 00:12.011

00:12.078 --> 00:14.948

00:15.014 --> 00:16.950

I am the best.

<i>- I know I can</i>
<i>pull the house off.</i>

00:18.284 --> 00:19.953
<i>It's definitely a risk.</i>

00:20.019 --> 00:23.423
- Did you see Holli's door?
Oh my God.

00:23.490 --> 00:24.724
- The judges have decided.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.960
Jason, you are safe from
elimination.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.962
- Is it lonely over there?

00:29.028 --> 00:30.296
- That means the rest of you

00:30.363 --> 00:33.700
must face off to fight for
your survival.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.970
- This is probably the best
tattoos in any one day.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.438
{\an1}- Today's gonna be
a heartbreaker.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.974
- Judges, it is time to
determine who's going home.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.076
- There's a little bit of lack
in Cam's versatility.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.277
- No, they're different.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.645
- Well you did
black and grey again.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.813
- I won't lie to you, Cam,

00:46.880 --> 00:48.181
like, they're very similar
styles.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.716
- The other person that
had shortcomings today

00:49.783 --> 00:51.985
would be Holli,
as far as application.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.253
- When it comes down
to a body of work,

00:53.319 --> 00:56.990
I clearly see that
Holli gets edged out.

00:57.056 --> 01:00.160
- Holli, you do not have what
it takes to be Ink Master.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.327

Half of you will be eliminated,

It's how we talk to clients.

Over three and a half million
Americans

04:02.108 --> 04:03.209
{\an8}- Yeah.

04:06.946 --> 04:10.049

04:37.243 --> 04:39.145
I was paralyzed in a

04:39.212 --> 04:41.581
I wasn't wearing my seatbelt
and was thrown out.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.082
- Oh my God.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.984
- This is my son Joey.
Joey has spina bifida.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.686
{\an3}And how long have you been
using your wheelchair?

04:46.753 --> 04:47.754
- My whole life.

04:47.820 --> 04:48.988
- And what's his name?
- Speedy.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.323
- What can you do in Speedy?

04:51.491 --> 04:53.092
[laughter]

04:53.159 --> 04:55.995
- Hi, I'm Jillian.
I have spinal muscular atrophy.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.098
I was diagnosed
when I was 17 months old.

04:59.165 --> 05:02.602
- My name is Chris,
and I have a rare disease

05:02.669 --> 05:07.106
known as spinal cerebellum
ataxia type 14,

05:07.173 --> 05:11.177
and there are
between 100 to 125 people

05:11.244 --> 05:13.579
in the world with my disease.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.580
- Wow.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.416
- This is Philip.
- Hi.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.117
- [sighs]

05:18.184 --> 05:19.452
- Philip has cerebral palsy,

05:19.519 --> 05:20.920
and he's been
in this wheelchair

05:20.987 --> 05:24.057
for about nine months now.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.324
- My name is Sharla, and I was
born

05:25.391 --> 05:27.093
missing both of my tibia bones,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.730
and I had to get my legs
amputated at 14 months old.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.067
- We've been in this
competition for so long,

05:34.133 --> 05:36.803

05:38.938 --> 05:40.740

<i>where we can actually</i>

05:40.807 --> 05:42.475
<i>do something for someone else,</i>

05:42.542 --> 05:44.644
and that feels good.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.045

All right, guys.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.947

05:48.014 --> 05:49.816

05:49.882 --> 05:51.417

06:04.731 --> 06:07.266

06:20.847 --> 06:22.915
to assign all of the human
canvases

06:22.982 --> 06:24.984

tattoo.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.819
Good luck.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.087
- How's it going, man?

06:28.154 --> 06:29.021
- For these people
to come in here today

06:29.088 --> 06:30.456
and get custom-made artwork

06:30.523 --> 06:33.192
to put on their wheelchair
is bad-ass.

06:33.259 --> 06:36.696
- I was born with spina bifida,

06:36.763 --> 06:39.665
and I've been my wheelchair
my whole life.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.534
{\an3}- He plays for a wheelchair
basketball team.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.969
- Oh my God, that's awesome.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.137
<i>- I want to see these artists</i>

06:44.203 --> 06:46.172
{\an8}take something
from these canvases,

06:46.239 --> 06:49.342
{\an8}something special about them
that they can bring to life

06:49.408 --> 06:52.211
by painting it on the side
of the spoke guards.

06:52.278 --> 06:55.615
- I know I definitely want
something that says Cure SMA.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.784
- SMA is spinal
muscular atrophy.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.786
It's a form
of muscular dystrophy.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.222
One in every 6,000 babies born
has SMA.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.223
- This happened
because of, like,

07:04.290 --> 07:05.224
a car accident sort of thing?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.493
- Yes. I was driving in an SUV.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.928
I hadn't done anything wrong

07:08.995 --> 07:11.564
except for not being buckled,
and I flipped. Yeah.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.133
It threw me out,
and I sat up out of the ditch,

07:14.200 --> 07:15.802
and I felt the top of my spine

07:15.868 --> 07:18.137
just like circle around the
bottom of my spine

07:18.204 --> 07:19.505
when I sat up, like I wasn't
connected.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.241
Like, it literally
just circled.

07:22.308 --> 07:27.079
- My specific disease is a
neurological disease.

07:27.146 --> 07:31.150
My main goal is to inspire
other children

07:31.217 --> 07:36.255
not to let their rare disease
define them, who they are.

07:36.322 --> 07:40.326
- When we go out with Philip,
people look at us weird,

07:40.393 --> 07:41.561
because why isn't he walking,

07:41.627 --> 07:42.795
and why are you helping him
eat?

07:42.862 --> 07:43.963
We have to--

07:44.030 --> 07:44.997
- They just don't understand.
- Right.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.432
I just wish
people would ask.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.000
Don't shush your
children when they stare

07:48.067 --> 07:50.236
or when they ask you a
question. Like, ask me.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.237
- Because that's how you
can educate people.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.371
- Right.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.040
He was diagnosed
with cerebral palsy,

07:54.106 --> 07:55.508
but I think it's really because

07:55.575 --> 07:57.009
they couldn't figure out what
was going on with him.

07:57.076 --> 08:00.680
We've had basic testing done,
and it's come back

08:00.746 --> 08:02.748
that there's some unknown
variables

08:02.815 --> 08:05.551
for some neuromuscular
disorders that are progressive.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.954
And we may never know
what's going on with him.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.457
- It's not the same thing,
but my mom lost a child,

08:11.524 --> 08:15.761
and unfortunately, it was from
suicide.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.196
And it's one of
those things where,

08:17.263 --> 08:21.033
you know,
there's never answers.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.637
{\an8}My brother passed away
about four years ago,

08:24.704 --> 08:27.773
and for me to get Philip,
I feel like it's fate.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.142
I just
want to make him happy.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.144
- I'm gonna treat this like
it was a tattoo consultation.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.645
We're gonna get you in some
ink right now.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.347
- I wanted the Statue of
Liberty,

08:35.414 --> 08:37.183
because this is a
memorable moment,

08:37.250 --> 08:38.717
and I don't want to forget it.

08:38.784 --> 08:42.288
And then on the other one, I
wanted Shao Wi.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.589
She's a mutt.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.258
- Would you forgive me
if it wasn't, like,

08:45.324 --> 08:46.392
an identical portrait
of your dog?

08:46.459 --> 08:48.327
- [laughs] Yes.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.263
- I'll do my best, I promise.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.565
{\an8}I think Sharla deserves
everything she's asking for.

08:52.632 --> 08:53.966
{\an8}She has a lot of requests,

08:54.033 --> 08:55.935
{\an8}so I'm gonna fit them all
in these wheels.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.336
- Bye, Philip.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.571
- Can you tell her
see you later?

08:58.638 --> 09:01.340
- See you later.

09:01.407 --> 09:02.642

18:07.419 --> 18:09.254
- It's gonna be really nice to
be in control of my own fate.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.522
How are you doing?

18:10.589 --> 18:11.723
I bet you were all wishing
you were

18:11.790 --> 18:13.392
a little nicer to me right
about now.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.526
What are you looking
to get?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.694
- I would like a snake
with roses

18:15.761 --> 18:17.963
going down my spine,
black work style.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.498
- That's good.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.067
- A plague doctor on the back
of my neck, up to my head.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.805
- A colorful neotraditional
sacred heart

18:26.872 --> 18:28.474
going from the
back of my head to my neck.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.510
- Are you looking to go
into this hairline?

18:31.577 --> 18:32.845
- Uh-huh.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.546
- Packing color in that area,
the skin there

18:34.613 --> 18:36.482
{\an8}just sometimes
just doesn't want to take it,

18:36.548 --> 18:38.383
so it's gonna be difficult.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.651
- What are you looking to get?

18:39.718 --> 18:41.820
- A trash polka eagle on the
back of my neck,

18:41.887 --> 18:43.222
outstretched.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.723
<i>- Trash polka's actually</i>
<i>kind of a fun style.</i>

18:44.790 --> 18:46.492
{\an8}Unfortunately for most of
the people in this room,

18:46.558 --> 18:48.227
{\an8}I don't even think
they know what it is.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.468
- American traditional coffin,
with a crying eye and roses.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.804
<i>- Because this canvas</i>
<i>wants a coffin,</i>

18:58.871 --> 19:00.205
<i>those straight lines</i>
<i>are gonna be a bitch</i>

19:00.272 --> 19:03.408
{\an8}to be perfectly straight
on the back of the neck.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.277
- An intricate black and grey
mandala

19:05.344 --> 19:07.513
going from my head
to my upper back.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.650
<i>- Pon, I clearly</i>
<i>have talked about mandalas.</i>

19:11.717 --> 19:13.085
<i>You know I love</i>
<i>doing line work,</i>

19:13.151 --> 19:14.520
{\an8}and like, nobody else
wants this thing.

19:14.586 --> 19:15.721
{\an8}Just give it to me.

19:15.787 --> 19:17.356
- All right.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.860
- Hold on to that one.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.195
<i>- Pon is giving out</i>
<i>the skull pics alone,</i>

19:23.262 --> 19:25.197
{\an8}but he is still a member of the
men's team.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.366
{\an8}So hopefully he is not gonna
give me a skull

19:27.432 --> 19:31.837
{\an8}that's gonna be
a pain in my neck.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.772
- Canvases, one by one,

19:33.839 --> 19:36.608
please read the artist's name
on the bottom of your skull.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.444
- Pon.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.546
- Jake.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.552
- Dani.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.291
{\an8}<i>- Trash polka eagle.</i>

19:52.357 --> 19:55.127
{\an8}Let's go
look up what that means.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.065
- Creepy Jason.

20:03.602 --> 20:04.636
- Cam.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.582
{\an8}- Really?

20:19.651 --> 20:20.886
- Laura.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.493
- You'll have six hours to
tattoo

20:28.560 --> 20:32.130
the back of your canvas's neck
and prove your finesse.

20:32.197 --> 20:33.498
Fail to impress the judges,

20:33.565 --> 20:35.934
and you will be
packing your machines.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.069
Good luck.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.572
- Hey, Jason. All right, man.

20:40.639 --> 20:41.607
- What's up, man.
Come on, let's chat.

20:41.673 --> 20:42.908
<i>- Today we're testing finesse</i>

20:42.975 --> 20:44.509
{\an8}by tattooing the back
of a neck.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.944
- I can take pain, so you're
in for a treat, man.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.379
- Oh, great. Good, man, good.

20:47.446 --> 20:49.114
- Whether it be color,
whether it be your outline,

20:49.181 --> 20:50.749
there's technical challenges
to this,

20:50.816 --> 20:52.384
and there's certain ways
that these artists

20:52.451 --> 20:53.819
need to know
how to apply it.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.787
- Let me see the back of
your neck real quick.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.089
- You want to get in
and get out.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.256
- Like, what kind of style
you going for?

20:58.323 --> 21:00.759
- I like a lot of color.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.527
- I know everyone assumes that
I'm just gonna convince

21:02.594 --> 21:04.763
every single canvas I get
to switch to black and grey.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.765
{\an8}But it's like, I can do color,
and I like to do it.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.867
{\an8}I think this piece will look
very cool in color,

21:08.934 --> 21:10.102
{\an8}so that's what she's gonna get.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.303
Would you like a red heart
with, like,

21:11.370 --> 21:12.871
a blue flame
or something like that?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.272
- I'm very into that, yes.
- I think that'd be super dope.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.941
I've done these
little daggers before,

21:16.008 --> 21:18.110
and I really think that they
add kind of a cool element.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.478
<i>This is top six.</i>

21:19.544 --> 21:21.546
Going home right now
is not an option.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.115
- Were you thinking, like,
wings open across the neck?

21:23.181 --> 21:24.216
- Yeah, coming around here.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.917
Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

21:25.984 --> 21:27.919
And then just having
asymmetrical red

21:27.986 --> 21:28.920
kind of splashes
and stuff in the back?

21:28.987 --> 21:30.555
- Yes, splatters.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.690
- When you're tattooing an
eagle,

21:31.757 --> 21:33.225
you imagine these giant wings,

21:33.291 --> 21:35.394
and I have such a small
space to work with.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.295
If I do these wings to actual
size,

21:37.362 --> 21:39.665
the body's gonna be about
this frickin' big.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.533
How invested in are you in
the Trash Polka,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.235
like with the
red and the black?

21:43.301 --> 21:45.170
Because I thought
we could make this eagle

21:45.237 --> 21:46.505
go this-- you know what I mean?

21:46.571 --> 21:47.806
And we could always add the
red stuff later

21:47.873 --> 21:48.974
with the dots
and all that stuff.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.709
Something in my body
is telling me no,

21:50.776 --> 21:52.244
like, this needs
to be different.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.446
And I can't figure out what
that different needs to be.

21:56.615 --> 21:57.716
- I'm like, stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

21:57.783 --> 21:58.917
I don't know--
I don't know what to do.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.485
What if we just did the dots
in red?

22:04.322 --> 22:07.025
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

22:07.092 --> 22:11.496
<i>♪ ♪</i>

22:11.563 --> 22:12.698
- I'm so glad you gave me that.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.266
That's literally all I did
for, like,

22:14.332 --> 22:15.500
the first three years
of my career,

22:15.567 --> 22:17.869
is mandalas
on the [bleep] neck.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.404
Like, what are the chances?

22:19.471 --> 22:22.374
Like, specifically
on the back of the neck.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.043
- I'm happy I could
accommodate you.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.345
- Yeah, I was like, oh, Pon,
coming through again.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.947
- Laura's so full of shit.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.949
<i>I think she just gets nervous</i>
<i>to show any weakness,</i>

22:31.016 --> 22:32.117
{\an8}so she's trying to sell me
on the fact

22:32.184 --> 22:33.552
{\an8}that she really wanted
this design.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.221
{\an3}Did you hear Laura,
like, being like,

22:36.288 --> 22:37.622
"Oh, that's what I wanted"?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.291
{\an3}I think she's trying
to psych me out,

22:39.357 --> 22:40.392
like you know, like,
make it seem like

22:40.459 --> 22:41.693
I did something wrong.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.929
- I think it was smarter
to give that to Laura

22:43.995 --> 22:45.797
than save it for Cam.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.332
- I feel like if I would've
gave that to Cam,

22:47.399 --> 22:49.034
that he would've
shot himself in the foot.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.535
It might not have
been such a bad thing.

22:50.602 --> 22:51.770
- True.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.642
- Okay, artists,
you have six hours

22:57.709 --> 23:00.545
to tattoo the back
of the neck.

23:00.612 --> 23:05.083
And your time starts now.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.985
- All right, cool.
- Let's do it.

23:07.052 --> 23:07.986
- I'm gonna have you stand
right here, okay?

23:08.053 --> 23:08.987
- Yeah.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.322
- For this elimination tattoo,

23:10.388 --> 23:12.824
everybody's got to tattoo
the back of the neck.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.092
- Looks like perfect.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.227
- Yeah?
- Yeah, literally.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.095
- First time?
Pretty impressive.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.663
- This is a difficult area
to tattoo.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.665
<i>The skin has a lot</i>
<i>different texture.</i>

23:20.732 --> 23:22.234
<i>And when you put</i>
<i>the stencil on</i>

23:22.300 --> 23:23.769
<i>and then they bend over,</i>

23:23.835 --> 23:27.439
{\an8}your tattoo goes from being
this big to this big.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.740
<i>And you have to tattoo it.</i>

23:28.807 --> 23:30.342
<i>And then when it shrinks</i>
<i>back up this way</i>

23:30.408 --> 23:32.611
when they stand up,
it still has to look good.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.012
- That is how you are gonna be
sitting, sir.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.113
I hope you are
comfortable.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.882
- I'm--yo, I'm good. I'm good.

23:36.948 --> 23:40.519
- Pulling long lines,
smooth curves, very difficult.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.254
- All right, put your
chin on your chest.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.555
- All right, let's do it.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.491
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
take my time,

23:46.558 --> 23:47.659
make sure it looks good.

23:47.726 --> 23:48.760
{\an8}Unfortunately for me,
my canvas's neck

23:48.827 --> 23:50.428
{\an8}is smaller than most.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.531
<i>The smaller it is, the harder</i>
<i>it is to put detail in it,</i>

23:52.597 --> 23:53.598
<i>especially on the neck.</i>

23:53.665 --> 23:54.900
<i>When you go small with detail,</i>

23:54.966 --> 23:56.268
<i>it swells up,</i>
<i>it's hard to work with.</i>

23:56.334 --> 23:57.969
So I'm just gonna
have to go pretty simple today.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.638
I'll just tell you what,
pulling those long lines

23:59.704 --> 24:01.139
across your head
is not [bleep] easy.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.141
- No, I believe it.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.644
- I can still do a clean, bold,
traditional feel tattoo,

24:05.710 --> 24:07.445
<i>and the only way I can really</i>
<i>show, like, good finesse</i>

24:07.512 --> 24:10.348
<i>is showing solid, clean black,</i>
<i>and solid colors.</i>

24:10.415 --> 24:12.717
But it's hard to pull off
on such a weird place.

24:12.784 --> 24:13.718
- Dude, that's one of the
coolest tattoos

24:13.785 --> 24:15.053
you've done here.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.154
It's like a totally different
Jake Ross tattoo.

24:16.221 --> 24:18.757
- So, cool.
- Go, team.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.592
- I don't know, man, I think
we should just do the eagle.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.227
I think it looks so dope,
standalone.

24:23.228 --> 24:25.397
<i>- The design, I like it,</i>
<i>I think it's striking,</i>

24:25.463 --> 24:27.199
but I can't spread out the
wings far enough.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.634
{\an8}I'm just,
I'm--I'm [bleep]ed.

24:29.701 --> 24:30.635
Where you're getting tattooed
right now,

24:30.702 --> 24:32.137
I want a tattoo there.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.207
But my boyfriend would kill me
if I shaved my head.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.943
<i>- My boyfriend leaves a lot</i>
<i>for the military.</i>

24:38.009 --> 24:40.312
He is my frickin' rock.
He is my anchor,

24:40.378 --> 24:42.514
<i>so not being home while</i>
<i>he's home right now is like,</i>

24:42.581 --> 24:45.317
God damn it, like, I'm missing
out on all this time

24:45.383 --> 24:46.651
<i>I could be spending with him.</i>

24:46.718 --> 24:48.119
Me being here, I want to make
it worthwhile.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.121
<i>It'll kill me to</i>
<i>just drop the ball now</i>

24:50.188 --> 24:52.424
<i>when I'm so close</i>
<i>to the next step.</i>

24:52.490 --> 24:53.725
Oh, it already looks so cool.

24:53.792 --> 24:54.960
I love wings on the back
of the neck like that.

24:55.026 --> 24:55.994
I think it's neat.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.762
- Four more hours.

24:57.829 --> 25:01.199
Four hours left.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.202
- Do we have a lot
of shading left?

25:04.269 --> 25:05.737
- I'm not rushing right now.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.038
I'm Italian, I ain't Russian.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.207
- [laughs] You look like it.

25:09.274 --> 25:10.242
{\an8}- My parents were always super
supportive

25:10.308 --> 25:13.111
{\an8}of my arts and my passions.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.213
{\an8}My mother is Antonia.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.214
- Oh my God, and your father--

25:16.281 --> 25:17.315
- And my father is Giuseppe.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.484
And they named me
Antonio Giuseppe,

25:19.551 --> 25:20.685
and my little
brother Giuseppe Antonio.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.220
- I love it.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.122
- My mom growing up
wanted to be a singer.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.024
My grandfather
didn't really support her.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.760
That's the reason she always
supports me.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.296
I'm doing this just as much for
my family as I am for myself.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.365
I sweat [bleep] olive oil.

25:33.431 --> 25:34.399
- As long as you've got
breadsticks,

25:34.466 --> 25:35.433
you'll be good.
[laughs]

25:35.500 --> 25:37.002
- There you go.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.103
Now I'm hungry.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.774
- Pon's trying to hold me back
by giving me a color piece.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.209
I really wanted that mandala,

25:44.276 --> 25:46.244
but I'm still pretty confident
about this one.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.980
- Cam's doing color tats?
What's going on here?

25:49.047 --> 25:52.150
[bleep] cats and dogs living
together, it's crazy.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.152
{\an8}- There's only six artists
tattooing in this room today.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.121
{\an8}A good tattoo
isn't gonna cut it.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.056
If I drop the ball even
the slightest bit,

25:58.123 --> 26:00.325
all this hard work I've put
into this entire competition

26:00.392 --> 26:03.361
could be for nothing.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.830
- You have three hours
remaining, everybody.

26:05.897 --> 26:10.769
Three hours left.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.437
- What do you think so far?

26:12.504 --> 26:13.972
- I think it doesn't look
anything like a mandala,

26:14.039 --> 26:15.440
that's for sure.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.641
{\an8}- For the first three years
of my tattooing career,

26:16.708 --> 26:17.909
{\an8}I did nothing but mandalas.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.945
<i>I will not let myself fail</i>
<i>at this.</i>

26:23.348 --> 26:25.250
{\an8}- Get the [bleep] out of here.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.484
You're just jealous because

26:26.551 --> 26:28.019
my black and grey's
better than yours.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.922
- Ugh. Oh my God, are you
trying to make me throw up?

26:30.989 --> 26:32.057
- If I actually pull this off,

26:32.123 --> 26:33.692
he's gonna be so [bleep]
threatened.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.794
It's all right, I can [bleep]
tattoo better

26:35.860 --> 26:38.596
than these [bleep] boys
even with heels on.

26:38.663 --> 26:40.765
- This is your final hour.

26:40.832 --> 26:43.001
Final hour, everybody.

26:46.037 --> 26:48.306
- This tattoo is turning out to
be a pain in my neck.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.308
- [bleep] getting real.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.110
{\an8}- Definitely regretting
putting in

26:52.177 --> 26:55.146
{\an8}all of these parallel lines
at the top of this design.

26:55.213 --> 26:56.614
Well, a little bit of
swelling,

26:56.681 --> 26:58.016
given how much work
we did in that area. [bleep]

26:58.083 --> 26:59.117
- I think it's because my neck
was down,

26:59.184 --> 27:00.118
and then when I went
up, maybe.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.386
- Yeah, yeah.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.320
- That's the only thing
I can think of.

27:02.387 --> 27:03.588
<i>- I've been riding high</i>

27:03.655 --> 27:04.689

27:04.756 --> 27:06.358
I'm on a bit of
a winning streak,

27:06.424 --> 27:09.627

want to [bleep] that up now.

27:19.170 --> 27:20.238
That is it. Machines down.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.174
Time is up. No more ink.

27:23.241 --> 27:26.344
- Oh my God, that's amazing.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.346
- What do you think?

27:28.413 --> 27:29.948
- I love it. Thank you.

27:30.015 --> 27:32.250
- That looks better than I even
anticipated. That's so cool.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.985
- You know Pon was trying to
screw you over.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.354
He knows that you would kill
that [bleep] mandala tattoo.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.455
- He immediately had a response
for, like,

27:37.522 --> 27:38.823
why he didn't give it to me.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.358
He wasn't like, "Oh, shit, like
you wanted that?"

27:40.425 --> 27:41.693
He was like, "Oh no, I didn't
want you to,

27:41.760 --> 27:43.094
like, shoot yourself in
the foot with that one."

27:43.161 --> 27:45.263
And then he mentioned it over
here, like, again

27:45.330 --> 27:47.332
as he's like, reiterating why
he didn't give it to me.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.666
Like, on the surface, I think
we're like,

27:48.733 --> 27:49.834
"Yeah, man, we're cool."

27:49.901 --> 27:51.269
But it's like, as soon as
it's just like--

27:51.336 --> 27:52.270
nah, we ain't [bleep],
you know, exactly.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.438
- Yeah.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.773
- I think really the wild card
in there

27:54.839 --> 27:56.808
was that trash polka one,
and it [bleep] landed.

27:56.875 --> 28:00.378
Unlike that eagle,
which will never fly again.

28:00.445 --> 28:03.114
- I know for sure that they're
all feeling comfortable

28:03.181 --> 28:04.449
right now
because they think

28:04.516 --> 28:06.051
that I did the worst today.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.218
For sure.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.056
- In these simple tattoos,
you've got to be perfect.

28:11.122 --> 28:12.724
- It was just an uphill battle.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.393
- Application-wise,
it is chewed up.

Did any of them hit?

28:33.912 --> 28:36.815

was the trash polka.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.016
- It's a dope-ass eagle.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.184

that.

You haven't picked the
same [bleep] style to do

28:47.759 --> 28:50.862
the same thing over and over,
let's be real.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.330

styles of tattoos.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.865

You're literally doing American
traditional tattoos

that you've done.

28:59.938 --> 29:01.306
- Well, [bleep] you first of
all.

29:01.372 --> 29:02.474
I'm not gonna get insulted
by a kid

29:02.540 --> 29:03.875

two years

29:03.942 --> 29:05.877
and try to tell me
what my artistic talents are.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.278

comfort zone, dude.

29:07.345 --> 29:08.880
- Just because I want to do
traditional tattoos.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.281
- Just get out of your
comfort zone.

29:10.348 --> 29:11.483

all the time, bro.

29:11.549 --> 29:12.584
But I'm not gonna [bleep] sit
here

29:12.650 --> 29:13.918
where there are six people,

29:13.985 --> 29:15.086
three of them are going
down to the bottom.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.721
I'm not gonna [bleep]
take a risk

29:16.788 --> 29:18.890

Men's team, let's start with
you.

29:40.445 --> 29:43.548
Pon.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.151
- It's a big tattoo, and
everywhere from top to bottom,

29:46.217 --> 29:47.986
the line work is very
consistent.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.054
But, it is a
little bit tonal.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.524
You could've gone super
dark with the leaves,

29:52.590 --> 29:54.125
and a little bit lighter with
the roses

30:07.639 --> 30:09.440
I've seen you do in the
competition.

30:09.507 --> 30:10.909
The design sits really well.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.044
I love the interaction of the
rope with the design,

30:13.111 --> 30:14.179
and I like the flow of
the rope.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.813
And your use of black here,

30:15.880 --> 30:19.050
and this bold, strong outline
on this really stands out well.

30:19.117 --> 30:20.952
I love this style of tattooing
out of you, man.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.954
Really, really nice tattoo.

30:23.021 --> 30:26.291
- Thank you.

30:26.357 --> 30:30.128
- Jason.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.429
I love this design,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.264
but the perspective
you chose to show,

30:33.331 --> 30:34.966
it creates some
questions.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.367
- You have it leaning forward,

30:36.434 --> 30:38.303
but then you have the roses
in front of it,

30:38.369 --> 30:39.871
making an impossible trick.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.040
And then the line work
in the top of the coffin

30:42.106 --> 30:43.975
where it's on the back of
the neck is not as nice.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.977
- Once my canvas stretched his
head over,

30:46.044 --> 30:48.213
it was just an
uphill battle from there.

30:48.279 --> 30:52.984
- Back of the neck is a
hard spot to tattoo.

30:53.051 --> 30:56.287
- Cam.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.589
- There's color missing.

30:57.655 --> 31:00.592
In this tattoo, you don't have
one segment

31:00.658 --> 31:03.328
anywhere within the
red that is solid.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.796
You've got huge holidays,

31:04.862 --> 31:07.599
and then anywhere where you do
the black

31:07.665 --> 31:09.100
to burgundy to red fade,
it's just stripy.

31:09.167 --> 31:13.004
It's not in enough to make it
that smooth transition.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.306
- But the biggest problem in
this tattoo are these swords.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.076
The handles of a couple of the
swords aren't in line,

31:18.142 --> 31:20.678
and then just in the black
lines, it is chewed up.

31:20.745 --> 31:23.414
Application-wise,
this is not up to par

31:23.481 --> 31:26.851
with the work
that you normally do.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.321
- Women's team, you're next.

31:30.388 --> 31:33.725
Laura.

31:33.791 --> 31:34.993
It's really beautiful.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.128
It's really delicate.
It's really clean.

31:37.195 --> 31:38.963
- I didn't want to do any fine
detail on a neck,

31:39.030 --> 31:41.032
so I recommended
doing some sort of flower.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.166
- Great move.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.868
- The rich, rich blacks are
what

31:43.935 --> 31:45.703
really make this thing
stand strong.

31:45.770 --> 31:49.040
Overall, you get
a really nice, rich look.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.341
- Thank you.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.643
- Psst.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.314
- Dani.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.152
- Your outlines are very crisp,
your shading is very smooth,

32:01.219 --> 32:04.522
but design wise, it just looks
wonky.

32:04.589 --> 32:08.159
The head is very wide,
the talons are very small,

32:08.226 --> 32:11.596
the size of the body versus the
size of the wings,

32:11.663 --> 32:13.298
everything about the anatomy of
this eagle

32:13.364 --> 32:16.067
is just very awkward.
It's very stumpy.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.402
- I think I panicked,
and so I made design choices

32:17.468 --> 32:19.070
that probably
weren't for the best.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.139
- It looks like it's been
nailed to the wall, instead of,

32:21.205 --> 32:23.608
like--

32:23.675 --> 32:27.211
anything, it's just--
very awkward tattoo.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.018
- See you in the bottom.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.620
- All right, judges,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.555
it is time to determine who
had the best tattoo of the day.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.424
- If you took all the designs
we have today

32:39.490 --> 32:40.758
and you just
looked at this on paper,

32:40.825 --> 32:41.993
you'd be like, "Hmm, where
could I put this?"

32:42.060 --> 32:43.561
Pon's snake, that
could go on the arm.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.097
You look at Laura's tattoo?
Where's that tattoo gonna go?

32:46.164 --> 32:47.398
- It's going there.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.101
All those lines that
Laura did, so spot-on

32:50.168 --> 32:52.103
and on the money,
everything lines up.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.338
Laura for the win.

32:53.404 --> 32:54.539
- My vote is for Laura.

32:54.605 --> 32:55.573
- Oh!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.075
- The judges have decided.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.410
The best tattoo of the day
goes to Laura.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.045
- Thank you.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.715
- That means, women's team,
you'll form a jury of peers,

33:03.781 --> 33:07.785
and you'll deliberate to put
one artist up for elimination.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.220
You can all head back
to the loft.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.895
- At this point, I truly do not
know who's gonna go home.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.132
If I had to guess, I--
I don't know who I'd pick.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.700
- This is your first, like,
real bad critique.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.503
- They hated that thing.
- I should've went with my gut.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.438
- Unfortunately for the girls'
team, if you go home,

33:27.505 --> 33:30.141
that's guaranteed two guys
in the finale.

33:30.208 --> 33:33.277
- I feel like my critique today
was just,

33:33.344 --> 33:34.846
and I think that's
the hard part,

33:34.912 --> 33:37.248
accepting that realization that
I'm kind of

33:37.315 --> 33:39.884
at the bottom end now,
where for a long time,

33:39.951 --> 33:41.753
I was at the top.

33:41.819 --> 33:45.256
Growing up, I felt like I
was always an underdog,

33:45.323 --> 33:46.691
like, all the time.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.327
I was always the weird kid who
just sat by himself

33:49.394 --> 33:50.895
and drew all the time.

33:50.962 --> 33:54.966
I never played sports,
never got into anything else.

33:55.032 --> 33:57.502
And I-- I'm here now to show

33:57.568 --> 33:59.737
that you don't have to conform,

33:59.804 --> 34:01.739
you don't have to give into the
bullies,

34:01.806 --> 34:03.908
that everybody that
picks on you all the time,

34:03.975 --> 34:06.144
and that you can just be true
to yourself.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.346
You can make yourself into
something

34:08.413 --> 34:10.915
and still be a [bleep] "freak,"
you know,

34:10.982 --> 34:13.150
as they [bleep] called me all
the time growing up.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.853
So, today I just feel like

34:15.920 --> 34:19.857
I let down my mission
on being here.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.726
- You didn't.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.195
- We're on like mile 25 of,
like, a marathon.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.663
You know,

We're so [bleep] close,

{\an1}- Thanks to you.
I am eternally grateful.

34:46.317 --> 34:47.652

34:50.922 --> 34:52.290

34:52.356 --> 34:53.591
If you were looking at this,
like a blind critique,

34:53.658 --> 34:54.759

34:54.826 --> 34:55.893

which one would you
like better?

34:57.395 --> 34:59.664

in Jason's, immediately.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.098
- Me too.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.767
- I mean, Jason's tattoo from
the head up is shit,

35:02.834 --> 35:04.535
but then from the bottom down
isn't too shabby.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.736
- Mm, yeah.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.138
- I mean, there's issues.
- There's issues.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.307
- But it's not as bad as the
entirely of Cam's piece.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.575
Cam has saturation issues

35:10.641 --> 35:11.576
throughout the
whole entire thing.

35:11.642 --> 35:12.810
His swords are crooked.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.679
Some of the swords
aren't even fully black.

35:14.745 --> 35:15.847
- I think you have a better
shot

35:15.913 --> 35:17.815
of defending yourself
against Cam.

35:17.882 --> 35:19.283
- I really hate that eagle.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.785
I panicked, and I was rushing
in the drawing board,

35:20.852 --> 35:22.653
and I shouldn't have done it.
Lesson learned.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.855
- There's no [bleep] way that
I'm gonna

35:23.921 --> 35:26.824
let you go home
without a [bleep] fight.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.827
- Today we're testing finesse
with back of the neck tattoos.

35:29.894 --> 35:30.828
How'd they do overall?

35:30.895 --> 35:32.129
- Oliver called it.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.498
Oliver was like, "Oh, no,
back of the neck's gonna

35:33.564 --> 35:36.100
give these people trouble,"
and it really did.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.468
- Creepy Jason.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.036
Those parallel lines going
up the back of that neck

35:39.103 --> 35:40.705
gets
really out of control.

35:40.771 --> 35:43.708
- And I really dislike the way
he placed it on the neck.

35:43.774 --> 35:45.710
- So you'd rather wear Dani's
tattoo than Jason's tattoo?

35:45.776 --> 35:46.944
- No. [laughs]

35:47.011 --> 35:48.379
- Dani's eagle,
the width of the body

35:48.446 --> 35:50.715
is the same width
as one of the wings.

35:50.781 --> 35:53.951
- What are those spikes out of
the corners? What is it?

35:54.018 --> 35:56.053
- It's my least favorite
tattoo of the day.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.355
- Well, Cam has the most
beautiful

35:57.421 --> 35:58.723
of the two other designs.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.892
- The blue up here
is not saturated.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.727
There is some areas
where it's pretty chewed up.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.695
And he also has some outline
problems.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.163
- I wonder how the women's team
is gonna vote?

36:06.230 --> 36:07.732
They're gonna put
somebody up for elimination.

36:07.798 --> 36:11.736
I'm certain it won't be Dani.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.471
- I think the only one that can
feel safe right now is Laura.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.072
Like, now at this point,

36:15.139 --> 36:17.275
it's like every tattoo
could go down.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.749
- All right, jury of peers.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.752
Which artist are you sending
down for elimination?

36:27.818 --> 36:29.086
- Jury of peers

36:29.153 --> 36:32.156
has decided to put up...

36:32.223 --> 36:33.991
Cam for elimination.

36:35.826 --> 36:40.898
- All right, in the bottom
we'll see Cam, Dani, and Jason.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.768
We'll see y'all and everybody
else downstairs.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.069
- You guys got this.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.772
I want to see you guys
both come up, seriously.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.607
- I am sorry to Cam and Jason

36:49.674 --> 36:51.842
for what we're about to say
down there.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.212

37:14.165 --> 37:15.433
All right, Laura,

37:15.499 --> 37:17.802
why did the women's team
vote Cam to the bottom?

37:17.868 --> 37:20.037
- Cam's just making very
strange decisions.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.405
The frosting fire,

37:21.472 --> 37:24.342
also inconsistencies of the
skin breaks

37:24.408 --> 37:26.043

where they penetrate the heart.

37:26.110 --> 37:27.878
Some of them are skin breaks.
Some of them are not.

37:27.945 --> 37:29.046
I don't know.

37:29.113 --> 37:29.981
It doesn't really seem
intentional.

37:30.047 --> 37:31.449
And also, just the red,

37:31.515 --> 37:33.451
it's so red, and it radiates,

37:33.517 --> 37:35.386
it looks so painful.

37:35.453 --> 37:37.254
- I feel like I've come to
expect

37:37.321 --> 37:39.824
a certain high level of
precision within my work,

37:39.890 --> 37:42.059
so when I don't meet that
expectation,

37:42.126 --> 37:43.461
it feels like
I'm falling even harder

37:43.527 --> 37:45.329
than if I was falling
from a lower platform.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.032
- You guys are all down here
for very different reasons.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.168
We all see each tattoo
having its own challenges

37:51.235 --> 37:52.837
and its own problems.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.839
- I was just trying to
step out of my own box.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.240
- Dude, you stepped into a box.

37:56.307 --> 37:57.942
You stepped into
the stagnant box.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.477
You put the hardest part

37:59.543 --> 38:01.846
of the straight areas
into the creases.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.614
- Your line work falls apart.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.750
- Jason's and Cam's, at first
glance, are appealing.

38:05.816 --> 38:07.418
But like,
I'm really bummed by--

38:07.485 --> 38:08.719
Dani, has nothing to do
with you,

38:08.786 --> 38:09.854
I'm really bummed
by that eagle.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.589
- With all these
misshapen parts,

38:11.656 --> 38:12.990
things got completely away.

38:13.057 --> 38:16.293
So my problem with you
is 100% your drawing.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.029
- I know that I dropped
the ball on the drawing.

38:18.095 --> 38:19.597
I can draw.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.866
I--I've been
doing it my whole life,

38:21.932 --> 38:23.934
you know what I mean?
I went to school for it,

38:24.001 --> 38:29.106
and I-- [bleep] I think this
was just a panic situation,

38:29.173 --> 38:31.375
and I was,
like I said, forced

38:31.442 --> 38:32.576
between a rock
and a hard place.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.944
- She was just
backed into a corner.

38:34.011 --> 38:36.714
I mean, to have an eagle
be proportionately correct

38:36.781 --> 38:38.849
on such a small
area of the body--

38:38.916 --> 38:40.685
- She chose that pose.
- You're interrupting me.

38:40.751 --> 38:41.886
- But they didn't-- they
didn't bring in that pose.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.154
- You're interrupting me.
Can I finish?

38:43.220 --> 38:44.522
- The whole tattoo can be the
same size.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.891
Just the head and the body
need to be smaller.

38:46.957 --> 38:48.359
- With yours--
- I'm sorry?

38:48.426 --> 38:50.695
- There is nothing that
I would stay, standing back,

38:50.761 --> 38:52.063
looking at this,
like, [bleep]ed up--

38:52.129 --> 38:53.197
that you've put onto this guy's
head.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.833
- Forgive me--
if I had to choose

38:55.900 --> 38:57.401
between doing a technically
good tattoo

38:57.468 --> 38:58.903
or damaging
someone's skin,

38:58.969 --> 39:03.908
I would gracefully
walk out of here.

39:03.974 --> 39:06.110
- For me, honestly,
the battle for bottom

39:06.177 --> 39:08.012
is between Cam and Dani.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.148
- It's a tough call, because do
I want the design

39:11.215 --> 39:13.084
that's great on paper
that's not packed,

39:13.150 --> 39:15.186
or do I want the one
that's not great on paper

39:15.252 --> 39:16.921
that's going to
stay forever?

39:16.987 --> 39:19.924
- You don't want crooked swords
that you can't fix either.

39:19.990 --> 39:23.928
- Or dead birds on the
back of your head.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.730
- If I'm a client, and I walk
into a shop

39:25.796 --> 39:28.499
and I look on the wall,
and I see these three designs,

39:28.566 --> 39:30.534
I'm definitely not picking
the eagle.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.938
My vote's for Dani.

39:34.004 --> 39:35.673
- We've sent the heaviest
hitters

39:35.740 --> 39:38.609
out the door based on drawing.

39:41.946 --> 39:44.949
Cam.

39:45.015 --> 39:48.919
- I see this problem with bad
design versus bad application.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.621
I mean,
I've juggled it quite a bit.

39:53.824 --> 39:54.959
My vote's for Cam.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.098

40:01.165 --> 40:05.603
Cam, you do not have what
it takes to be Ink Master.

And it could happen to
anybody.

40:14.311 --> 40:15.613
But keep your head high.

and close shop.

You can help me figure out how
this thing's supposed to look.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.457

41:01.826 --> 41:03.093
I know you're gonna

This is the first time that I
