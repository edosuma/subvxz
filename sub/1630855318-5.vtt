all the way ♪

00:05.792 --> 00:08.667
[cheers and applause]

00:08.667 --> 00:11.292
It seemed like every time
they asked Mama Joyce

00:11.292 --> 00:14.459
what type of man she would want
for her daughter,

00:14.459 --> 00:15.959
- the bullsh-- happened.
- Somethin'.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.918
I probably would've
picked anyone

00:17.918 --> 00:21.584
that had a decent job.

00:21.584 --> 00:22.459
Come on, mama.

00:22.459 --> 00:23.834
Don't come with that
bullsh-- with me.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.375
I'm tired of it.

00:25.375 --> 00:28.209
Kandi, what's going on
with, um, Blaze?

00:28.209 --> 00:33.083
You talkin' about the shooting
that happened at Blaze?

00:33.083 --> 00:34.959
It was a private matter.

00:34.959 --> 00:37.959
My nephew was shot by someone
he met at Old Lady Gang, okay?

00:37.959 --> 00:39.125
And that was his roommate.

00:39.125 --> 00:41.250
My blood nephew is dead,

00:41.250 --> 00:42.501
and you're talking
about acting.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.292
- But feel-- but if-- but feel--
- No, you're acting, though.

00:44.292 --> 00:44.959
(BLEEP) you!

00:44.959 --> 00:47.000
I'm coming out
at halftime

00:47.000 --> 00:49.250
- for the Magic City Classic.
- Yes.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.375
I invited all of the ladies.
I need a kick-ass routine

00:52.375 --> 00:57.459
because this is sponsored by
my Kenya Moore Hair Care.

00:57.459 --> 00:58.792
Whoo-hoo!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.792
- We're here.
- Yes!

01:00.792 --> 01:02.334
I've never eaten a booty.

01:02.334 --> 01:03.792
Kenya, what did you do
when you did it?

01:03.792 --> 01:05.042
[screaming]

01:05.042 --> 01:07.125
Let the show begin.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.334
You like to boss
people around.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.334
You got in charge issues,
and you try and run everything.

01:11.334 --> 01:12.834
Monyetta,
you gotta meet us there.

01:12.834 --> 01:14.292
I'm sorry. Bye.

01:14.292 --> 01:18.125
[camera shutter clicking]

01:18.125 --> 01:19.584
This is my--
this is my son. So...

01:19.584 --> 01:20.542
Aww.

01:20.542 --> 01:25.751
Were we dropped off
at the wrong address?

01:25.751 --> 01:26.959
Okay, wow.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.209
We're getting kicked out.

01:28.209 --> 01:32.876
We can't stay.
We gotta go.

01:32.876 --> 01:34.959
This is the millionth
strike for Kenya.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.959
Why am I even on this trip?

01:36.959 --> 01:38.250
It just feels like
something is happening,

01:38.250 --> 01:39.959
and we're being left out.

01:39.959 --> 01:43.792
- Let's go to her room.
- Let's go ask her.

01:43.792 --> 01:49.542
[pounding on door]

01:49.542 --> 01:51.167
Summer! Summer!

01:51.167 --> 01:52.959
What the (BLEEP)
is wrong with you?

01:52.959 --> 01:54.125
- Nothin'. Summer! Summer!
- My child is here!

01:54.125 --> 01:56.501
- Summer. Don't, bitch!
- Get the (BLEEP) out! Stop!

01:56.501 --> 02:02.209
Get your ass out here and
put Brooklyn in another room!

02:02.209 --> 02:06.459
No, but, no,
that's bullsh--.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.626
Kenya, if you can come,
we just had a couple questions.

02:08.626 --> 02:09.584
Who the (BLEEP) are you?

02:09.584 --> 02:14.959
Stop being disrespectful
wit' your broke ass!

02:14.959 --> 02:17.167
Chile, I'm leavin'.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.542
- This bitch is disrespectful.
- Hmm? I don't know.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.334
This is what this young lady
does all the time.

02:21.334 --> 02:23.959
- Not yet. She didn't get it.
- This old young lady.

02:23.959 --> 02:25.792
She feels that she can
bring you somewhere.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.334
She walks and does
what she wants,

02:27.334 --> 02:28.834
and I don't know if you care

02:28.834 --> 02:29.626
'cause I know that's
you're a friend,

02:29.626 --> 02:31.000
but it's not----in' fair
to you.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.167
Aye-aye-aye.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.834
I'm going to go
eat some steak,

02:33.834 --> 02:35.792
and y'all can sit here
and knock,

02:35.792 --> 02:38.250
and click-clack,
and talk around.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.792
No, I can do what
the hell I wanna do.

02:40.792 --> 02:41.876
I'm a grown-ass woman,

02:41.876 --> 02:44.959
and everybody is accountable
for their own actions.

02:44.959 --> 02:47.792
I am so not here for Marlo
banging on Kenya's door,

02:47.792 --> 02:49.209
disrespecting her.

02:49.209 --> 02:51.417
Kenya can explain
all of this,

02:51.417 --> 02:53.125
but she left me out here
to defend myself

02:53.125 --> 02:58.042
with the wolves.
Girl, come on.

02:58.042 --> 03:00.083
- And you be the example.
- I don't be the example.

03:00.083 --> 03:00.959
- 'Cause she's older than me.
- Well that's good.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.334
- I'm not the example.
- That's good.

03:02.334 --> 03:03.417
Well, you know what?
Everybody--

03:03.417 --> 03:05.167
Bitch, what I am
the example for is I don't play

03:05.167 --> 03:06.167
when it comes to disrespect.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.000
- I feel you, and that's real.
- Oh my god.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.959
No, my family and
everything so--

03:07.959 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, you won't waste time
being here

03:10.000 --> 03:11.250
if Kenya was being
this disrespectful.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.167
I'm definitely
not wasting time.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.626
You could stay home
wit' your family.

03:13.626 --> 03:14.501
- Absolutely.
- Good.

03:14.501 --> 03:16.334
Marlo and Monyetta
are both the type

03:16.334 --> 03:18.083
who has to have
the last word.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.626
It's like playing
rock, paper, scissors

03:19.626 --> 03:21.125
with two rocks.

03:21.125 --> 03:30.918
Goodbye. Goodbye.

03:30.918 --> 03:34.751
Listen, y'all,
y'all, yall...

03:34.751 --> 03:36.459
Monyetta.

03:36.459 --> 03:37.292
Don't do that.

03:37.292 --> 03:38.209
Nobody did anything
to her ever.

03:38.209 --> 03:41.918
Did she just slam
the damn door in my face?

03:41.918 --> 03:43.959
I might've tried,
but that door was heavy.

03:43.959 --> 03:45.959
Nah, uh...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.876
I know that Marlo
did not intentionally

03:47.876 --> 03:50.959
slam the door on Monyetta.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.375
From my vantage point,
I thought she did.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.459
[laughing]

03:53.459 --> 03:56.959
The only person I let
shut doors on me is Jesus.

03:56.959 --> 04:06.083
No, I don't play, though.
I don't.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.000
She's gonna talk
about me the whole time.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.584
- Run away, again.
- Bye-bye. She's boring.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.417
- Monyetta. Monyetta.
- Run away.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.417
Say your sh--
and run away, childish.
- I'mma keep runnin'.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.417
That thing is, a tacky
damn mess. She's a--

04:14.417 --> 04:16.375
- No, no.
- I'm not following behind her.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.417
I'm just walkin'.
I'm classy. She's a hot mess.

04:18.417 --> 04:21.584
She ain't got nothin'
to talk about if I leave.

04:21.584 --> 04:24.626
She tried to close the door
in somebody's face with force.

04:24.626 --> 04:27.626
Like, girl,
do she wanna go back to jail?

04:27.626 --> 04:28.542
Marlo, Marlo, Marlo--

04:28.542 --> 04:29.501
that's all you're
talking about, bitch.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.626
I'm outside.
You're still talkin' about me.

04:31.626 --> 04:33.626
Where is my food?

04:33.626 --> 04:35.209
I gotta call the lady
for my damn food.

04:35.209 --> 04:36.209
I'm hungry.
I'm gonna have to--

04:36.209 --> 04:38.542
- Marlo, breathe.
- Monyetta--

04:38.542 --> 04:39.792
I have nothing else
for this bitch.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.042
And-and-and you
told her that.

04:41.042 --> 04:42.167
- But--
- Nothing.

04:42.167 --> 04:44.250
For the sake of the group
and us just figuring out

04:44.250 --> 04:45.167
why we're here and how long
we're gonna be here, let's--

04:45.167 --> 04:47.042
Yeah, and then not this
open the door

04:47.042 --> 04:49.334
lookin' like a damn
demon possessed.

04:49.334 --> 04:54.959
What the (BLEEP)
is wrong with you?

04:54.959 --> 04:57.667
Bitch, you are crazy.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.667
Thank you.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.584
Hello.

05:00.584 --> 05:02.125
We are in Birmingham.
Is that Kenya?

05:02.125 --> 05:08.792
Girl, this girl is crazy,
like, honestly.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.209
Girl, I'm done.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.375
I don't fall for anything.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.501
My superpower
is having kindness.

05:14.501 --> 05:17.542
Can we just ride,
like, some scooters?

05:17.542 --> 05:19.626
Not tonight but, yes,
I think that would be fun.

05:19.626 --> 05:25.125
[laughing]

05:25.125 --> 05:26.959
Yeah, I don't--

05:26.959 --> 05:28.292
The banging
was not done by me.

05:28.292 --> 05:31.959
Us.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.292
- No, we knocked.
- Marlo's not with us.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.792
I'm really close friends
with Monyetta and Sheree,

05:37.792 --> 05:38.959
but I'm really upset
with them

05:38.959 --> 05:43.209
because they were watching Marlo
try to break the door in.

05:43.209 --> 05:47.042
What the hell is wrong
with these girls?

05:47.042 --> 06:00.083
- Oh, I do hear Brooklyn.
- Aww.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.083
We just wanted
to talk to you

06:01.083 --> 06:02.792
about, like, you know,
what's happening here.

06:02.792 --> 06:03.792
- Yeah.
- You know, like,

06:03.792 --> 06:05.542
football game is cool
and stuff, but it's like,

06:05.542 --> 06:07.042
I'm gonna be on the road
for four hours,

06:07.042 --> 06:08.375
so I just wanna know,
like, you know, like,

06:08.375 --> 06:12.501
what are we doing?
Like, what is--

06:12.501 --> 06:13.834
- Don't come back?
All right, well...
- No, but Kenya--

06:13.834 --> 06:14.751
Don't come back.
Okay, it's fine.

06:14.751 --> 06:15.918
- Thank you.
- All right.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.167
That-that's cool
with me, too. I'm out.

06:18.167 --> 06:19.584
Go home
and don't come back.

06:19.584 --> 06:21.000
Say less, sis.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I have work in the morning,
and I'm still here.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.709
She was way worse to me
in Jamaica.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.959
She expected me
to be at her beck and call.

06:27.959 --> 06:29.626
You haven't checked
on us all day.

06:29.626 --> 06:30.792
Kenya, I was working.

06:30.792 --> 06:31.918
You want me to stop
running, and say,

06:31.918 --> 06:33.042
"Oh, the girls
aren't here, guys.

06:33.042 --> 06:35.292
"I can't work. Let me see--
Hi. Hi, Kenya and Sheree."

06:35.292 --> 06:36.209
I do.

06:36.209 --> 06:37.959
I know things would have
been different

06:37.959 --> 06:40.167
if her besties,
Drew and Kandi, were here,

06:40.167 --> 06:43.334
but they didn't even
take the time to show up.

06:43.334 --> 06:45.334
Everybody's thing is,
are we just here for a game?

06:45.334 --> 06:47.834
But I really feel like
it's somethin' more
than that, Kenya.

06:47.834 --> 06:50.042
- So, of course--
- Yeah.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.167
Kenya, that's all
you had to say.

06:52.167 --> 06:57.959
(BLEEP) a game.
We're here to see you.

06:57.959 --> 07:04.959
That's all you had to say.
I know--

07:04.959 --> 07:08.876
Let's just sit
right here.

07:08.876 --> 07:11.667
- I am so freaking pissed...
- Yeah.

07:11.667 --> 07:14.375
...that I let her
take control of me.

07:14.375 --> 07:16.542
Well, at least you
recognize that, Marlo.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.334
Sh-- happens.

07:17.334 --> 07:18.709
We have to make
the best of it,

07:18.709 --> 07:20.959
and I think, rightfully,

07:20.959 --> 07:23.083
we have a right to know
why we're here.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.667
[cell phone ringing]
I get it. I get it.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.501
Hey. Sanya, hold on.

07:27.501 --> 07:29.167
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Hold on.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.209
What did you find out?

07:30.209 --> 07:33.292
We didn't find out sh--.
She told me to leave.

07:33.292 --> 07:35.250
No-no empathy for the fact

07:35.250 --> 07:37.250
that we're here and have
no idea what's happening,

07:37.250 --> 07:38.584
- and there's a big secret.
- Yeah, no-no empathy.

07:38.584 --> 07:39.792
And it's the weekend.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.959
I can be hanging out
with my nephews.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.125
I just texted her.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.209
"You are a rude, selfish
mother----er.

07:45.209 --> 07:47.959
"Seek help, rude bitch."

07:47.959 --> 07:50.792
I can just hear
my life coach, now.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.834
"Baby, we got a lot more
work to do."

07:52.834 --> 07:55.959
She's Kanye West.
She needs help.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.167
And I put,
"Love, Marlo."

07:58.167 --> 08:00.042
And I'm gonna--
I'm gonna post this.

08:00.042 --> 08:01.042
No, no, you're not. No.

08:01.042 --> 08:04.167
I'm gonna post it
on Instagram and tag her.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.959
How can we bring it
back together?

08:06.959 --> 08:08.375
I'm straight.
I'm straight.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.167
And it ain't even
no nice sh-- to me no more.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.250
Like you said
Pookie and them,

08:11.250 --> 08:13.125
I got Ray-Ray and them,
and they're some gorillas.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.167
Don't call
Ray-Ray and them.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.834
Do not call
Ray-Ray and them.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.292
I think I know
Ray-Ray and them.

08:19.292 --> 08:21.167
The Cleveland girl was ready
to get on the phone

08:21.167 --> 08:22.584
and call Pookie and them

08:22.584 --> 08:25.167
to come over there
and whoop your ass.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.542

- how are you, gorgeous?
- How are you, girl?

17:50.792 --> 17:52.709
- Hey.
- Good morning.

17:52.709 --> 17:54.375
Good morning.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.792
What's going on, beautiful?

17:56.792 --> 17:58.542
Like Jamaica vibes
in here.

17:58.542 --> 17:59.626
Good morning.
Good morning, ladies.

17:59.626 --> 18:00.584
How are you?

18:00.584 --> 18:02.417
Okay, of course,
last night was crazy,

18:02.417 --> 18:05.626
but I woke up this morning
hearing a lotta commotion

18:05.626 --> 18:06.959
outside my door.

18:06.959 --> 18:07.959
I kinda,
'cause I hear this stuff,

18:07.959 --> 18:10.959
and I open the door,
and there's an EMT outside.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.125
- What? The ambulance?
- The ambulance.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.375
Shut up.

18:13.375 --> 18:15.000
Kenya, she's at the hospital,
right now.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.626
Wait a minute.
What?

18:17.626 --> 18:18.959
I don't know.
I haven't heard back.

18:18.959 --> 18:19.792
Have you, uh--?

18:19.792 --> 18:21.209
She was going to
get a chest X-ray.

18:21.209 --> 18:22.167
Like, it's serious.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.918
Yeah, she was having
trouble breathing.

18:23.918 --> 18:24.834
I was not expecting that.

18:24.834 --> 18:25.542
Where is Brooklyn?
It's Brooklyn okay?

18:25.542 --> 18:26.584
Brooklyn is with her nanny.

18:26.584 --> 18:27.751
- Yeah, she-she's in her bed.
- Oh, she's here?

18:27.751 --> 18:29.834
Uh, her, yeah, assistant
was in-in the room with her.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.042
Mm-hmm.

18:31.042 --> 18:32.250
So, ambulance, I mean,
they're taking her.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.959
Can we go see her?

18:33.959 --> 18:35.375
Yeah, let's try
and FaceTime her now.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.751
[phone ringing]
Okay, hey.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.459
- Hey, Kenya.
- Kenya.

18:39.459 --> 18:50.250
- How are you?
- I feel bad for her.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.584
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

18:51.584 --> 18:55.250
- Can we come see you?
- No, they're-- no.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.584
Just worried about you,
seriously, Kenya.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.083
We're sending prayers
and kisses to you, Kenya.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.959
Yeah. Love you, baby.
Okay, muah.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.292
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Muah.

19:02.292 --> 19:03.375
- Bye, baby.
- Get some rest.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.375
- She looks exhausted.
- I know.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.125
She is.
Like, it's serious.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.584
Yeah.

19:07.584 --> 19:08.792
'Cause, you know,
since my mom passed in July--

19:08.792 --> 19:11.125
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

19:11.125 --> 19:11.959
Oh, my God.

19:11.959 --> 19:14.459
So, seeing her is just--
I'm sorry.

19:14.459 --> 19:16.417
Monyetta, it's okay.
I'm so sorry.

19:16.417 --> 19:17.584
[crying]

19:17.584 --> 19:20.542
Oh, my God,
I am so sorry.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.584
This stuff is serious.
Oh, thank you.

19:22.584 --> 19:23.834
Thank you, Marlo.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.667
We need to say a prayer for
her, though, too, for real.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.626
So, I don't know.

19:26.626 --> 19:29.209
Do you feel--
let's say one just together.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.584
One request, please, Lord,
just make sure she's okay,

19:31.584 --> 19:33.334
whatever she needs,
whatever touch,

19:33.334 --> 19:36.209
to bring her back strong,
beautiful, smart,

19:36.209 --> 19:37.959
- and powerful as ever.
- Yes.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.751
- In Jesus name, amen.
- Thank you.

19:39.751 --> 19:42.542
Golly, that hurt my--
like, we argue, we're fussing,

19:42.542 --> 19:43.918
and we're fighting
about stupid sh--,

19:43.918 --> 19:44.918
and this is real stuff
in the hospital.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.083
- Exactly, yes.
- It is.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.876
And I don't even know what
happened with us last night,

19:47.876 --> 19:48.751
- but it--
- I don't.

19:48.751 --> 19:50.292
Girl, I don't
know what happened.

19:50.292 --> 19:52.334
I don't-- just I'm sorry,
whatever happened.

19:52.334 --> 19:54.209
I don't know about this. Okay.

19:54.209 --> 19:55.792
No, it is.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.417
Marlo is like
Jekyll and Hyde.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.584
Normally, I don't negotiate
with terrorists,

19:59.584 --> 20:02.667
but I got my cousin and them
on speed dial.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.125
I'm good to go.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.667
I don't know.

20:05.667 --> 20:06.626
Maybe you were in your moment,
but, girl, you were, like,

20:06.626 --> 20:08.501
this close from hitting me
with that door.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.375
You know what?
We went through the door.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.167
The door is so heavy and
I don't know if the weight--

20:13.167 --> 20:16.000
- the door slammed on its own.
- Yes, yes, yes.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.584
- Are you serious?
- Wow.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.709
She thought
you slammed the door on her.

20:21.709 --> 20:25.375
It slammed. Yes.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.250
I did not.
Sh--, I was drinking.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.209
I don't remember
damn bamming on the door.

20:29.209 --> 20:30.959
I don't remember
slamming the door,

20:30.959 --> 20:33.292
but I do remember,
and Sheree cosigned,

20:33.292 --> 20:35.334
that door was
Heavy as sh... hell.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.667
- Okay, so, that's it.
- Wow.

20:37.667 --> 20:38.959
Finally, clarity.

20:38.959 --> 20:39.918
Let's just respect each other.
I know I'm gonna respect you.

20:39.918 --> 20:40.918
Oh, I always do that.
I appreciate that.

20:40.918 --> 20:42.876
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do.

20:42.876 --> 20:43.834
I'm gonna do take
my accountability.

20:43.834 --> 20:44.667
Yeah, yeah.

20:44.667 --> 20:45.584
If you're really
working on yourself,

20:45.584 --> 20:46.667
- you've gotta switch it up.
- I'm working.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.000
I'm gonna think positive.
I'm gonna think positive.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.792
Okay, ladies,
let's do a group hug.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.542
Yes.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.375
Let's just go pack up,
get some food,

20:54.375 --> 20:57.209
and hope
we hear back from her soon.

20:57.209 --> 20:59.918

and I'll take you to a party ♪

20:59.918 --> 21:04.125

21:04.125 --> 21:06.292
Kenya is in the hospital.

21:06.292 --> 21:07.209
What happened to her?

21:07.209 --> 21:10.083
Somethin' with her heart
or her chest,

21:10.083 --> 21:12.167
but I don't know if she's
just overworking herself

21:12.167 --> 21:13.876
because even though
we don't get along,

21:13.876 --> 21:16.000
I feel so sorry for her, seriously.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.167
Oh, my God.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.792
The kitchen was closed,
so I had to order everybody

21:34.792 --> 21:35.667
Uber Eats.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.959
Oh, cappuccino,
that's probably mine.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.167
- Hello.
- Hello, ladies.

21:39.167 --> 21:42.751
- Hey, Courtney.
- Yes, there she is.

21:42.751 --> 21:44.501
- Divas.
- Well, hey, honey.

21:44.501 --> 21:46.167
Hey.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.083
Have y'all heard from Kenya?
Is she okay?

21:48.083 --> 21:49.626
Her assistant did text me.

21:49.626 --> 21:52.167
Uh, "Just a quick update,
Kenya is running a fever."

21:52.167 --> 21:53.125
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.584
"So, they're keeping
her to run tests."

21:54.584 --> 21:55.375
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.334
I called to try
and send flowers,

21:56.334 --> 21:58.918
but they said she was
already checked out.

21:58.918 --> 21:59.959
- Checked out?
- Oh, no, really?

21:59.959 --> 22:03.375
- Yeah.
- Huh.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.918
Bitch, I said,
"Get well soon,"

22:04.918 --> 22:06.375
not, "Immediately."

22:06.375 --> 22:09.375
Kenya was discharged
in 30.4 seconds.

22:09.375 --> 22:12.209
That sh-- was faster than
Sanya ran her races she won.

22:12.209 --> 22:14.959
Lord Jesus.
[laughing]

22:14.959 --> 22:15.959
That's the good thing, though.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.000
She's probably
going back home.

22:17.000 --> 22:17.709
- That's great, though.
- Oh, we didn't know that,

22:17.709 --> 22:18.125
- but that's great.
- Yeah.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.167
No, we didn't.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.083
I was even looking forward to
the game today

22:20.083 --> 22:22.209
'cause I just felt
it was gonna be, like,

22:22.209 --> 22:23.918
- hyper and all that.
- You were gonna dance. Yes.

22:23.918 --> 22:25.459
Show us the dance
you did for Kenya.

22:25.459 --> 22:27.375
Give us a little bit of it.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.375
Take the jacket off and
give us a little bit.

22:29.375 --> 22:33.542
Yes.

22:33.542 --> 22:36.501
Okay, yes.

22:36.501 --> 22:41.167
Oh!

22:41.167 --> 22:43.375
Oh, bitch,
Monyetta can dance, now.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.876
That I will give that bitch.

22:44.876 --> 22:46.834
You practiced.
Yes, darling.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.501
Oh, yes.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.792
Finish it strong.

22:49.792 --> 22:52.209
One thing I have
and I just hope,

22:52.209 --> 22:54.709
I hope that we can keep
this positive energy in Atlanta.

22:54.709 --> 22:56.667
- This is so amazing.
- That would be amazing.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.959
When your other
girlfriends are around,

22:57.959 --> 22:58.918
- Kandi and Kenya--
- Yes.

22:58.918 --> 22:59.792
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.918
Are we still gonna be able
to be--

23:01.918 --> 23:03.000
- have that same--
- Yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Right, of course.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.167
Long as you show me respect
and, you know,

23:07.167 --> 23:09.417
don't-don't be trying to
fight my friends.

23:09.417 --> 23:10.959
Now, see,
that may be a problem.

23:10.959 --> 23:12.334
- [laughing]
- Oh, wait, wait.

23:12.334 --> 23:13.584
- That may be a problem.
- See?

23:13.584 --> 23:14.626
Just wait.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.209
Is this what Marlo's life coach
is teaching her?

23:17.209 --> 23:19.250
The bitch needs to
get her money back.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.250
When y'all got into it,
you know,

23:20.250 --> 23:21.167
I was still nice to you.
I still talked to you.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.959
Okay, well, as long as you--
okay, so,

23:22.959 --> 23:24.000
you still would be nice.
Okay, okay.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.959
- But it's-it's baby steps.
- Well, I love you guys.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.167
We love you, too.

23:29.167 --> 23:32.959
So, in keeping with this energy
that I love, Sheree,

23:32.959 --> 23:35.000
- I have a question about you.
- Me?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.375
Yes.

23:36.375 --> 23:40.167
How are you gonna be
with my wonderful cousin?

23:40.167 --> 23:42.209
I haven't met
the wonderful part yet.

23:42.209 --> 23:43.083
This is a ditzy bitch.

23:43.083 --> 23:43.751
Did you just call me
a ditzy bitch?

23:43.751 --> 23:46.209
- I did, bitch.
- Bitch.

23:46.209 --> 23:48.083
Drew seemed to have
a real chip on her shoulder.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.542
I don't know if it's jealousy,

23:49.542 --> 23:51.042
or if it's just
her being a hater.

23:51.042 --> 23:52.667
You don't wanna confront
Fatum in her face.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.501
You should be focusing
more on She by--

23:54.501 --> 23:56.375
- I do.
- She not done, still.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.209
When you go with her,

23:57.209 --> 23:58.626
just see how
everything rolls out.

23:58.626 --> 23:59.792
- Yeah, and I--
- I would never tell you

23:59.792 --> 24:00.876
not to establish a relationship
or anything like that.

24:00.876 --> 24:02.876
No, absolutely,
and I know you wouldn't, right?

24:02.876 --> 24:04.125
- Yeah.
- Tread lightly.

24:04.125 --> 24:07.209
She called me, uh, recently,
singing Sheree praises, honey.

24:07.209 --> 24:08.375
- I love it.
- Yes.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.209
So, then we-- but then we took
a couple steps backwards

24:10.209 --> 24:12.375
because, the next week,
she's talking about me

24:12.375 --> 24:22.459
and lying in an interview.

24:22.459 --> 24:24.042
Yeah. So, that's-that's
what I get with her,

24:24.042 --> 24:25.584
so I don't--
I don't know where we are.

24:25.584 --> 24:27.000
- Okay.
- If she did more cardio

24:27.000 --> 24:28.542
instead of running
that big, fat mouth,

24:28.542 --> 24:31.417
then she'd have more to focus on
than just me.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.542
Let's see how that goes.

24:33.542 --> 24:35.167
- But all right, let's hit it.
- I wanna get on the road.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.792
Look, I thought
this was supposed to be

24:36.792 --> 24:40.000
a fun girls' trip,
but it was a big-ass disaster.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.876
Go to Birmingham--
you're gonna get in and out.

24:41.876 --> 24:45.959
Tell 'em Marlo sent you
and that you're Kenya's VIP.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.375
- I'm proud of you, Marlo.
- Me, too.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.375
I am.

24:48.375 --> 24:49.709
I'm-I'm proud of you, too,
but I will say this.

24:49.709 --> 24:50.584
What?

24:50.584 --> 24:51.584
It's not gonna work out
with Monyetta

24:51.584 --> 24:54.083
- when she gets around the group.
- We'll see.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.167
- How did we start off with six?
- I don't know.

24:56.167 --> 24:57.000
I don't know.

24:57.000 --> 24:57.792
They're-they're
dropping like flies.

24:57.792 --> 24:58.751
Then it's just
the three of us.

24:58.751 --> 25:00.959

your grandchildren, right?

33:28.209 --> 33:29.501
- I do.
- Okay, well,

33:29.501 --> 33:32.042
I'm sure you know
they love you, too.

33:32.042 --> 33:33.375
- I do.
- But when they get older,

33:33.375 --> 33:35.125
I'm sure they ain't gonna wanna
see you dogging their daddy out

33:35.125 --> 33:35.959
every time they-they
turn around.

33:35.959 --> 33:40.000
Well, I want Ace,
at six years old,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.167
to know to start
taking out the trash.

33:42.167 --> 33:45.083
That's something his daddy
should be teaching him.

33:45.083 --> 33:47.792
That's something
that a man do.

33:47.792 --> 33:51.375
The guy you married was
a guy that was, like,

33:51.375 --> 33:53.501
a meek and humble
little person.

33:53.501 --> 33:54.959
You tell me what
I need to do to fix it,

33:54.959 --> 33:56.918
and I'm gonna do my best.

33:56.918 --> 34:01.042
Now, he's like-like
a George Jefferson little guy.

34:01.042 --> 34:03.375
- What?
- Yeah.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.959
You are tripping.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.042
No, I'm not, you know.

34:06.042 --> 34:08.167
Mama, you always be wanting
to talk about what a man

34:08.167 --> 34:09.709
- supposed to be doing.
- Well, that's just--

34:09.709 --> 34:11.792
- that's just in any household.
- No, ma, I-I--

34:11.792 --> 34:14.876
I'm gonna need you not
to do that to my man.

34:14.876 --> 34:16.792
If that's what you accept
from your man, well,

34:16.792 --> 34:18.250
then that's
what you accept.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.125
Exactly, so stop-stop
nitpicking him.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.334
You accept your man.

34:20.334 --> 34:21.667
You know, I ain't
nitpicking him.

34:21.667 --> 34:22.709
- You love your man.
- Yes, you do.

34:22.709 --> 34:25.834
And you love your man
not taking out the trash

34:25.834 --> 34:27.626
and go to strip clubs or
whatever like that, then--

34:27.626 --> 34:29.792
We go to
strip clubs together.

34:29.792 --> 34:34.709
I am not threatened by
a stripper at the strip club.

34:34.709 --> 34:40.459
Girl, I'm telling ya.

34:40.459 --> 34:42.626
If that's what
y'all like, hey, hey.

34:42.626 --> 34:45.792
What do you
and your man like?

34:45.792 --> 34:48.209
- If I get one--
- Exactly, if you get one.

34:48.209 --> 34:51.417
- Now, leave my man alone.
- You know.

34:51.417 --> 34:55.584
I think you just gotta accept
that I like who I like.

34:55.584 --> 34:57.959
You and I just
think different.

34:57.959 --> 35:00.375
Well, okay,
I agree with that.

35:00.375 --> 35:04.501
I think that we should
go to counseling,

35:04.501 --> 35:07.501
and it would be nice
if we could just kinda sit,

35:07.501 --> 35:11.709
and talk, and try to figure out
how to get on one accord.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.167
That would be good.

35:13.167 --> 35:14.834
God, thank you.

35:14.834 --> 35:18.417
My mom agreeing to counseling
is definitely giving me hope,

35:18.417 --> 35:21.959
but I think that the therapist
is gonna need therapy

35:21.959 --> 35:23.459
after hanging out
with us.

35:23.459 --> 35:27.501
I feel like we gotta mend.

35:27.501 --> 35:30.250
- Yes.
- Mend and blend.

35:32.292 --> 35:33.792
All right, mom.

35:33.792 --> 35:36.334

some side shade behind it.

first called me,

38:17.626 --> 38:19.083
I thought it was
a great conversation.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.083
- Mm-hmm.
- You were telling me

38:20.083 --> 38:22.167
how much you appreciated every--
you know, me,

38:22.167 --> 38:23.459
and, you know,
starting this platform,

38:23.459 --> 38:25.375
- and doing these things and--
- Mm-hmm.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.167
But then, after that,
someone shared with me

38:27.167 --> 38:29.167
a-a interview
that you did.

38:29.167 --> 38:31.375
You said, "Everything
that Sheree gave us

38:31.375 --> 38:33.542
- at the reunion, she took back."
- Mm-hmm.

38:33.542 --> 38:35.209
You're like,
"She confiscated everything."

38:35.209 --> 38:36.584
I don't think I said,
"Everything."

38:36.584 --> 38:37.209

38:37.209 --> 38:38.125
"Things were confiscated."

38:38.125 --> 38:41.542
She was literally
confiscating everything.

38:41.542 --> 38:44.167
- I wanted to get the bag.
- What bag?

38:44.167 --> 38:45.959
It was
a She by Sheree bag.

38:45.959 --> 38:48.334
We're getting
She by Sheree?

38:48.334 --> 38:50.292
- That bag is cute.
- I want the bag. It is cute.

38:50.292 --> 38:51.626
That was
my personal bag

38:51.626 --> 38:53.709
that I actually had
my personal belongings,

38:53.709 --> 38:55.417

you know,

38:55.417 --> 38:56.417
- for everybody else.
- Hmm. Hmm.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.918
So, that was never
supposed to go out there.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.584
Hmm.
That happened then,

38:59.584 --> 39:01.751
and then the call
to you was after,

39:01.751 --> 39:02.542
so I just want
to make that clear.

39:02.542 --> 39:03.584
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

39:03.584 --> 39:04.584
- Okay.
- It was genuine,

39:04.584 --> 39:06.375
so I don't want you
to think that it was not.

39:06.375 --> 39:09.375
It's not really so much
for me the timeline.

39:09.375 --> 39:10.834
It's the content of things
that she was saying,

39:10.834 --> 39:12.250
which were lies.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.918
I see who she is.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.334
I see what she gives.

39:15.334 --> 39:16.584
I'm not buying it,
but she can go ahead

39:16.584 --> 39:18.584
and hop on my website
and make a purchase.

39:18.584 --> 39:20.375
All I know is
I didn't get nothin'

39:20.375 --> 39:22.459
- and what I wanted--
- You didn't get anything?

39:22.459 --> 39:24.375

I heard Marlo had five hats,

39:24.375 --> 39:26.417
uh, four-four tee shirts,
a sweatshirt.

literally in the fingertips

39:36.334 --> 39:38.375

39:38.375 --> 39:39.542
I'm glad we're here,

39:39.542 --> 39:41.334
- because you missed it--
- Yeah.

39:41.334 --> 39:42.334
- In Birmingham.
- Oh.

39:42.334 --> 39:43.626
- Mm-hmm.
- We went to lunch,

39:43.626 --> 39:45.626
and I just remember
the little phone call

39:45.626 --> 39:48.000
we had about Marlo
attacking you.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Oh, girl.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.751

cute last night.

39:50.751 --> 39:54.125
Y'all look happy.

39:54.125 --> 39:54.876

a whole different story.

39:54.876 --> 39:56.501
No, so let me
get to this.

39:56.501 --> 39:59.584
You know, you told me
after it was all over with,

39:59.584 --> 40:01.125
she had a problem
with you

40:01.125 --> 40:02.334
- for not being--
- Mm-hmm.

40:02.334 --> 40:04.125
- Hard enough on Kandi.
- Yeah.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.167
Everybody was leaving.

40:05.167 --> 40:07.167
I went outside
and said goodbye.

40:07.167 --> 40:08.667
I go back in the venue,

40:08.667 --> 40:12.167
and she literally is,
like, on attack mode.

40:12.167 --> 40:14.125
Like, I'm not
doing that tonight.

40:14.125 --> 40:14.959
I'm not-- okay.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.501
Don't make my fight
your fight.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.667
- No, it's my fight.
- I need you

40:17.667 --> 40:19.334
- to understand that.
- I'm gonna ask you a question.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.209
Like, "You went
too easy on Kandi

40:22.209 --> 40:24.083
'cause you didn't
use the word."

40:24.083 --> 40:25.959
I am from Chicago.
We don't use that word.

40:25.959 --> 40:26.876
- Mm-hmm.
- Shooting?

40:26.876 --> 40:28.042
Yeah.

40:28.042 --> 40:29.626
I was there two days
before the shooting,

40:29.626 --> 40:32.626
so I was concerned truly
because I had 30 of my family--

40:32.626 --> 40:34.459
But why didn't you say,
"shooting," though?

40:34.459 --> 40:37.250
And why is that any--
any of your business anyway?

40:37.250 --> 40:39.167
Yeah, no,
I don't do well with people

40:39.167 --> 40:41.375
standing in my face,
coming in my personal space,

40:41.375 --> 40:42.209
and being aggressive,

40:42.209 --> 40:43.459
- especially for no reason.
- Me, too.

40:43.459 --> 40:45.959
She said she was sitting down.
She said you were over her.

40:45.959 --> 40:48.292
No, I was standing
against the wall.

40:48.292 --> 40:50.459
She was sitting,
and then she stood up.

40:50.459 --> 40:53.417
She tell you that part?

40:53.417 --> 40:55.375
- No.
- Okay, of course not.

40:55.375 --> 40:57.000
She went on to tell me

40:57.000 --> 40:58.417
something happened
with her nephew.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.250
I didn't understand
if she was saying

41:00.250 --> 41:03.209
that her nephew was shot
at the restaurant.

41:03.209 --> 41:04.167
- Like, I wasn't clear.
- Yeah, that's not--

41:04.167 --> 41:06.584
her nephew worked
for Kandi's restaurant.

41:06.584 --> 41:08.876
He met a guy
that was working

41:08.876 --> 41:10.501
in Kandi's restaurant,
as well.

41:10.501 --> 41:13.959
They became roommates,
and the one guy shot her--

41:13.959 --> 41:15.459
killed her, uh, nephew.

41:15.459 --> 41:17.667
Okay, that wouldn't have
anything to do with Kandi.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.834
Her thing is that my nephew
worked at your restaurant,

41:20.834 --> 41:24.501
and you didn't even reach out
to the mom or send flowers.

41:24.501 --> 41:26.792
I was very confused.

41:26.792 --> 41:29.709
Hey.

41:29.709 --> 41:31.334
Just put it between
her big toe

41:31.334 --> 41:34.292
and her little toe.
[laughing]

41:34.292 --> 41:36.709
So, uh, uh, Courtney,
I mean, I know you--

41:36.709 --> 41:38.542
- you're-- that's your cousin.
- Yeah.

41:38.542 --> 41:39.876
Did you give Courtney
my phone number?

41:39.876 --> 41:41.125
- Tell the truth.
- I did not.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.250
No, I promise you
I did not,

41:43.250 --> 41:44.334
but she invited you somewhere

41:44.334 --> 41:45.667
that could
be really, really fun.

41:45.667 --> 41:47.459
- Yeah. Is it at her house?
- Yeah, it's like

41:47.459 --> 41:49.167
a teambuilding,
and it's like a laser,

41:49.167 --> 41:50.292
sort of like a laser light,
and you have to, like,

41:50.292 --> 41:51.959
figure out, like,
the matrix almost,

41:51.959 --> 41:53.375
- how to get out.
- Oh.

41:53.375 --> 41:54.417
- Oh, I'm not good at those.
- So, it's got different,

41:54.417 --> 41:57.083
you know, active--
activities, like, we can do--

41:57.083 --> 41:58.459
- Okay.
- And missions

41:58.459 --> 41:59.751
- and things like that.
- It should be fun.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.000
- Okay.
- So, I think it'll be fun.

42:01.000 --> 42:01.792
- No--
- Listen, when we were

42:01.792 --> 42:03.792
in Alabama,
we all made a pact

42:03.792 --> 42:08.918
that we're gonna continue
the good energy in the group.

42:08.918 --> 42:11.667
I hope that we can keep
this positive energy in Atlanta.

42:11.667 --> 42:15.334
- This is so amazing.
- That would be amazing.

42:15.334 --> 42:16.876
So, you're gonna
send Marlo good vibes.

42:16.876 --> 42:18.334
Going with
the good vibes.

42:18.334 --> 42:19.584
There was an incident

42:19.584 --> 42:23.375
between someone
that worked for you

42:23.375 --> 42:26.042
and one of Marlo's nephews.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.209
I'm gonna tell you
what the (BLEEP)

42:27.209 --> 42:29.167
- I'm telling you, right now!
- Tell me what the (BLEEP)

42:29.167 --> 42:30.375
Well, I'll be
my positive self.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.667
I can be very forgiving
for anyone.

42:32.667 --> 42:34.167
Her character went
out the window

42:34.167 --> 42:36.167
when she slashed
all those people's faces.

42:36.167 --> 42:38.959
I think that the key is,
you acknowledge,

42:38.959 --> 42:40.709
apologize,
and change behavior.

42:40.709 --> 42:41.584
Go cry to your mama.

42:41.584 --> 42:43.584
The only reason
why I'm crying right now

42:43.584 --> 42:45.417
is 'cause I can't----ing
choke your ass, bitch!

42:45.417 --> 42:47.375
You just kinda
have to, you know,

42:47.375 --> 42:48.751
see who
is gonna show up.

42:48.751 --> 42:53.542
- You okay?
- Do not----ing grab me!

42:53.542 --> 42:57.542
And then you will see
who will show out.
