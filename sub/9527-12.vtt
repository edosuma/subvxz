WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.669
- Oh, milk it, Dersy.
- There you go.

00:02.753 --> 00:05.838
- Oh! Milk the mother teat.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.007
--Man, it is hella cool

00:08.092 --> 00:10.009
when, like, the moon is out
during the day.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.178
- Like, how does that even work?
- I don't know.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.597
When you think about it,
the stars are still there,

00:14.682 --> 00:17.100
and, like, they just keep going, you know?

00:17.184 --> 00:20.186
They go on for, like, forever, like...
Forever ever.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.854
-Forever ever?
-Yeah.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.941
I mean, it's like Joe Rogan says,
"We're just talking monkeys

00:25.025 --> 00:27.860
"on an organic spaceship
flying through the universe."

00:27.945 --> 00:29.320
And also, his thoughts on, like,

00:29.405 --> 00:31.572
if a girl won't suck upon your balls,

00:31.657 --> 00:33.700
-you guys aren't meant to be together.
-Smart.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.034
It's funny, 'cause it's true.

00:35.119 --> 00:36.202
Well, you heard how he said, like,

00:36.286 --> 00:40.123
"Imagination is the force
behind our evolution."

00:40.207 --> 00:41.874
And I think he's... He's right.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.794
When I was a kid, my imagination
was ridiculousness.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.046
Like, I was always coming up with stuff.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.382
Think of all the different paths
you could have taken in your life.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.550
I could have tooken so many paths.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.218
I could have been, like, a trombone player,

00:52.302 --> 00:53.928
in, like, "Nah Orleans,"
just blowing my bone!

00:54.012 --> 00:56.889
Or I could have been, like, a cop,
but, like, a dirty one, you know?

00:56.974 --> 00:59.559
-Sounds like a normal cop.
-Or like a porno star, right?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.227
But not just like a regular porno dude.

01:01.311 --> 01:05.231
Like a star, dude.
Like, "Oh, here comes Adam with his big hog

01:05.315 --> 01:06.774
- "all greased up."

01:06.859 --> 01:08.693
That I feel is a real calling that I missed.

01:08.777 --> 01:09.944
I'd watch you bone.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.571
-I definitely would.
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.281
But you know what, you don't
even have to sweat that, man,

01:13.365 --> 01:14.615
because, really, when you think about it,

01:14.700 --> 01:17.577
life doesn't even really
get good until you're, like, 70.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.661
-You know?
-Yeah.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.121
Like being an old dude is awesome,

01:20.205 --> 01:23.916
like, just not having to do anything
but, like, sit around, watch cartoons,

01:24.001 --> 01:26.919
and smoke the herb, bro.
That's gonna be tight.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.005
Isn't that what you do already?

01:29.798 --> 01:30.798
Yeah. Yeah.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.050
Yeah, but when you're 70,
your dick won't work.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.595
-You can't star in pornos.
-Dude, they got medicine for that.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.681
-Yeah. Dicks work forever now.
-Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Big Dipper!

01:39.308 --> 01:41.726
This is my year! 2015, baby!

01:41.810 --> 01:43.060
2015! Whoo!

01:43.145 --> 01:45.146
-Oh, it's just that guy...
-Yeah, it's the guy across the street.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.814
You don't even need the telescope for that.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.274
Whoo! Starting defense!

01:48.358 --> 01:50.443
Place at the table, baby! Whoo!

01:54.615 --> 01:55.990
I'm fresh

01:57.201 --> 01:59.243
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

01:59.328 --> 02:00.453
Gotta be fresh

02:02.998 --> 02:04.707
--Whoa, dude.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.668
Okay.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.086
-Uh...
-I didn't mean to do that.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.755
-Hey, thanks for the smoothies.
-Yeah.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.507
-Honestly...
-Smooth move, operator.

02:12.591 --> 02:17.053
...it's NBD because I do generous stuff
like buy smoothies for my bros quite often.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.139
Yeah, no, you don't. Actually,
I think you've stolen from us a couple times.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.224
Bunch of times.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.393
I would consider myself the Robin Hood
of the crew. I'll say that.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.686
Plus...

02:26.230 --> 02:29.524
In order to be happy,
you have to make others happy,

02:29.608 --> 02:31.025
and that's a Joe Rogan quote.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.276
- Mmm-hmm.
- That reminds me

02:32.361 --> 02:33.653
of one of my favorite Roganisms.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.239
-Um...
-And I know what it is, and I'm gonna stop ya.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.617
It's, uh,
"If a girl can lift weights with her pussy,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.578
"she's gotta be
an unstoppable freak." Am I right?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.081
- That's a good one, but no. It's actually...
- Uh...

02:45.165 --> 02:47.500
"If you get cancer from a cell phone,

02:48.210 --> 02:49.502
"you're a pussy!"

02:49.586 --> 02:52.755
Also good. But, no, I was... It's that,
"Robin Hood can suck it."

02:53.423 --> 02:54.632
Which I thought was pretty funny,

02:54.716 --> 02:56.884
and you were talking about it and...
What's on your leg?

02:56.969 --> 02:59.428
Huh? Oh, my...

02:59.555 --> 03:00.555
Hi.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.807
Hundreds, and in different colors and sizes.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.017
Hey, Alice, so...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.645
We found this kid,
and he didn't have, like, a leash,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.231
and we don't know, like, the last
time he's been let out to poop,

03:10.315 --> 03:11.566
so we don't know where he came from.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.609
I mean,
we have a guess as to whose it is.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.028
I lost my virginity when I was 17 years old,

03:16.113 --> 03:20.533
and I'm not proud of that.
I should have been at least 14 or 15, but...

03:20.617 --> 03:24.078
I mean, I think the math works out
that this could be my child.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.538
-He's mine.
-Oh.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.790
You leave this kid alone
for five goddamn seconds,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.292
he gets into all kinds of trouble.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.544
--Yeah. God damn it.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.337
Uh, guys, this is Mr. Gainey.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.172
He's from Stock Surplus.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.925
He's here to buy up all those old mirrors
that you couldn't sell.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.344
-Remember those?
-It's tough to sell mirrors over the phone.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.556
Well, this is his son Josh,
who Jillian is supposed to be watching.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.100
-Jillian!
-What's up? I'm just hanging out with Josh.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.605
Hey, Josh! Why'd you disappear, huh?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.064
Don't you want to play with the worms?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.567
Huh? Come on, the worms are our friends.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.111
This is Carla,
and that's her ex-husband, Roddy...

03:57.279 --> 03:59.739
I don't want to play with her. She sucks!

03:59.823 --> 04:02.116
- Hey! Hey! Watch your mouth!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.618
Okay? We don't use the "S" word.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.661
Jeff lets me say it at Mom's house.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.039
Jeff is an idiot tennis instructor.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.833
And does this look like your mom's house?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.752
- I wanna play with them!
- Ow!

04:12.836 --> 04:14.420
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you mind?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.923
He's just gonna whine
and whine until he gets his way.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
Kinda like his mother in that way.

04:18.717 --> 04:23.471
Yeah, look, um, I just think it's probably
a better idea if he stays with Jillian.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.555
Yes.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.933
No. Alice, it's mine. I get to keep it.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.893
What? Why? Why can't we watch him?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.770
-Because...
-Well, because we're dumb.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.230
And we're irresponsible and
we're idiots and we're stupid.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.358
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly right, Adam.
Thanks.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.360
Hang on a second. Uh... I'm sorry.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.528
I think we can handle one little dude.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.407
- Right? I mean, uh, when I was a lifeguard, I...

04:43.992 --> 04:46.327
Well, unfortunately, that's
probably not the best example.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.411
I wanna go with them.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.454
- Yes!
- I like them.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.539
- Yeah!
- Um, would it be okay?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.542
Yeah, sure. That's fine.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.752
Perfect!

04:54.836 --> 04:57.171
Alice, check this one out.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.381
He's quiet and little.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.257
I named him Waymond Wormano.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.884
Cute, get it, 'cause... No!

05:02.177 --> 05:03.135
-Waymond!
-I like kids.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.220
Yeah.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.556
What the... My Strawberry Surf Rider!

05:07.641 --> 05:09.558
No! Don't drink the floor smoothie!

05:09.643 --> 05:10.851
Don't! Get up, get up, get up, get up.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.979
You've been Bill Cosby'd.
You've been Bill Cosby'd.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.146
I Bill Cosby'd myself.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.524
But instead of, like, a date rape drug,

05:16.608 --> 05:19.652
it's, like...
I put peyote in the smoothies.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.779
What? Why?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.740
I was trying to get on, like,
a spiritual level, like...

05:24.825 --> 05:27.576
Like when we were on the roof, you know,
talking about, like, cool...

05:27.661 --> 05:29.578
Like cool stuff about imagination and stuff.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.580
You... Peyote? At work?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.665
- Yeah!
- Yeah, well,

05:32.749 --> 05:34.333
as Joseph Rogan said,

05:34.418 --> 05:36.794
he took, like, peyote before an MMA class

05:36.878 --> 05:37.962
and he said, "It was the bomb diggity."

05:38.046 --> 05:40.381
Do not make up Joe Rogan quotes.
That is not okay!

05:40.465 --> 05:42.216
No, I'm paraphrasing, okay?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.593
Why did you Joe Rogan us?
Why couldn't you just Seth Rogen us?

05:44.761 --> 05:45.970
-Yeah! We could have just...
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.139
- ...smoked a bunch of weed.
- Right.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.557
Babysat the kid.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.017
We Seth Rogen ourselves all the time.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.643
This is different. I was trying to Joe Rogan us.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.021
- Where's the kid?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.148
-Kid? Kid!
-Where's the kid? Kid!

05:57.649 --> 05:58.649
Who remembers his name?

05:58.734 --> 06:00.693
Uh... It's Jash, like the YouTube channel.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.696
-Wait, um...
-Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.322
You guys, I'm starting to feel weird.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.284
There he is!

06:09.286 --> 06:11.328
Whoa! What's happening?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.788
It's kicking in.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.124
- Here it comes.
- Peyote!

06:18.837 --> 06:19.879
What?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.172
Oh, God!

06:21.298 --> 06:22.965
-Whoa!
-Just...

06:23.050 --> 06:25.051
We gotta go, we gotta go, we gotta go! Go!

06:31.183 --> 06:32.892
What's happening?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.351
Whoa!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.645
--Oh, God!

06:36.730 --> 06:37.730
I'm okay!

06:37.814 --> 06:39.398
Okay, are you all right?

06:39.483 --> 06:41.650
It's a black hole!

06:42.152 --> 06:44.695
--No! No!

06:46.990 --> 06:49.450
-Oh, God. Come on! Come on!
-Okay!

06:49.534 --> 06:51.202
Wait, wait, no, no! I'm not ready!

06:58.627 --> 07:00.377
It's pretty normal now!

07:05.675 --> 07:06.675
There he is.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.053
Hey! You can't just run off like that, okay?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.721
You can get killed running down that hallway.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.307
I'm bored. I want us to all color together!

07:14.434 --> 07:15.434
Uh...

07:15.811 --> 07:17.186
Hey, it's almost lunchtime.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.689
We gotta get out of here now, man,
go somewhere quiet where we can be alone.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.026
I know just the place where no one goes.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.028
-The office gym.
-Good call.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.115
We'll put this little dude on the elliptical,
tucker him out,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.991
and then we'll just wait
for the peyote to wear off.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.452
-Okay.
-Someone make a copy of my coloring book

07:33.537 --> 07:34.912
so we can all color together.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
- Okay, yeah, we'll do that. First...
- Hey!

07:37.207 --> 07:38.207
Listen to me!

07:41.002 --> 07:42.002
Oh, my God.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.385
I said I want us
to color together... Now!

07:49.553 --> 07:51.971
-Yeah, yeah, whatever you want, man.
-If you want to color, we'll color.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.390
Okay, Adam,
go make some copies of the coloring book,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.226
and, Blake, go find some markers
and pens, right?

07:57.936 --> 08:01.981
And since I'm the tallest,
I guess I'll take the giant to the gym.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.942
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.286
We're here and, uh, why don't you just...

08:15.871 --> 08:18.414
Play in that corner or something
until Blake and Adam get back, okay?

08:18.623 --> 08:20.291
But I wanna play a game.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.251
I wanna play hide and go seek!

08:22.335 --> 08:24.420
Uh, that's too bad,
because games are for children,

08:24.504 --> 08:25.588
and I'm a grownup.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.590
Let's play zookeeper.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.384
I'm the zookeeper, and you're a bird.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.012
I'm not a bird. I'm a man, okay?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.264
And just don't turn into a giant again, please.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.434
Then why do you have wings, ya bird?

08:38.768 --> 08:39.977
I don't have...

08:40.979 --> 08:41.979
Oh, my God.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.399
What the hell?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.949
I'm a bird? I'm a bird?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.202
I'm a...

08:56.286 --> 08:57.912
Fly, Mr. Bird, fly!

08:58.246 --> 09:00.581
Oh, my God!

09:00.957 --> 09:02.625
I'm flying! Look at me, Mr. Zookeeper!

09:08.131 --> 09:09.381
Excuse me.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.550
Hey, somebody missing their grandma?

09:11.635 --> 09:12.635
Hey, lady, that's my desk.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.141
Ah!

09:20.310 --> 09:21.685
I'm messing with you!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.479
It's a joke, you bitch!

09:24.272 --> 09:25.481
Whoa...

09:26.149 --> 09:27.149
You're old me.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.984
Yes! Hello!

09:29.110 --> 09:30.736
-Sick, dude! Wow.
-It's me.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.322
I'm... The hair looks... Sick.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.657
Oh, my God, thank you.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.659
It's like cobwebs. It's awesome.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.827
-Yeah. Chicks dig it.
-That is very cool.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.454
Hey, what's the deal with the chick thing?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.164
Are we getting laid a lot or...

09:42.582 --> 09:45.000
-Do we have a wife?
-Oh, hell no! Oh, no.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.877
Me and that ho-bag Jillian, we got a divorce

09:46.962 --> 09:49.171
when I caught her chorging Bill
in the parking lot.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.633
What? Wow... Ugh, man, I'm sorry about that.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.510
Best thing that ever happened to me!

09:54.594 --> 09:57.596
Now I go to the potluck/orgy every week.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.848
Lot of chicks. Some dudes, too.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.183
I don't care.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.810
We're so old, it doesn't matter.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.020
You know, play it where it lies.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.522
That's... That's gross!

10:06.690 --> 10:08.274
It's not gross. It's love.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.234
Why do you work here?
Why don't you just quit?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.111
Because it rules, dude.
What are you talking about?

10:12.195 --> 10:14.405
All I do all day is watch cartoons and...

10:14.489 --> 10:16.365
Well, smoke weed.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.825
Yeah!

10:17.909 --> 10:21.161
Actually, I don't have to hide it.
I smoke it right in daylight.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.539
Wait... You can do that?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.583
You kidding me? I can smoke it. I grow it too.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.259
Yeah, fuck Karl. I don't need him.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.810
You're... And I'm...

10:45.729 --> 10:48.188
Sergeant Adam DeMamp, RCPD.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.898
You're a dirty cop.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.278
Hey, uh, what do you say we get outta here,
go shake down some small business owners?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.362
Huh?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.865
You can use my gun.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.659
I would love to threaten someone.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.119
I know that about you.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.080
But I ain't no pig.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.332
No.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.213
I hope somebody ordered sausage!

11:13.298 --> 11:15.090
--I know you, man.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.508
I know this path.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.260
I'm so glad I didn't become you.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.970
Yeah, right.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.432
Oh, my God!

11:23.850 --> 11:24.933
Your dick is huge.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.269
If I would have delivered pizzas,
my dick would have been huge.

11:27.479 --> 11:31.648
What's up? My name's Adam
"The Human Jump Rope" DeMamp.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.026
I'm an adult film star.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.779
Peep this!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.113
Oh!

11:38.281 --> 11:40.074
Oh! It's still coming!

11:40.200 --> 11:41.950
Oh, it's catching the cardboard.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.495
Mine's out on the first pull.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.872
I don't even need to pull. I actually...
I flick mine out.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.710
Whoo!

11:51.795 --> 11:54.338
Michael Keaton should be eatin' a bat,

11:54.422 --> 11:55.964
'cause I'm the real birdman!

11:58.218 --> 11:59.301
You're a zoo bird!

11:59.386 --> 12:02.471
And it's time for you to go back in your cage!

12:02.889 --> 12:05.724
What? No, but I feel so free up here!

12:05.975 --> 12:09.353
I'm the zookeeper,
and I said get back in your cage.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.397
But you said I could fly!
You said I could be free!

12:12.899 --> 12:14.983
-You belong to the zoo!
-Oh!

12:19.489 --> 12:21.615
Freakin' bird brains!

12:27.414 --> 12:29.289
And there's a dude right there, isn't there?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.335
Yeah, Trombone Adam, you are good!

12:33.878 --> 12:35.379
Do you know any Matchbox Twenty?

12:35.505 --> 12:37.172
That's not my bag.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.049
I dig jazz.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.301
You still play?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.887
I don't, actually. I stopped in the eighth grade.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.932
I was gettin' pretty serious into
masturbating at the time, so...

12:47.142 --> 12:48.434
Understandable.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.603
I guess I only had time
for one bone in my life.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.399
How about you play my bone, baby?

12:56.234 --> 12:59.695
Okay, yeah. I'll toot your bone.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.280
Come with me...

13:03.032 --> 13:04.867
To New Orleans.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.911
Play with me and the boys.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.708
I tell ya what. You make some serious bread!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.626
You guys make bread too?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.336
You a fucking idiot.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.505
--Hey!

13:20.133 --> 13:21.633
Are you done?

13:22.010 --> 13:24.303
Yes. I am done, I...

13:24.387 --> 13:25.429
Oh, man.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.559
Ooh, baby!

13:31.227 --> 13:32.936
I can do whatever I want, man.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.147
I got dirt on everybody.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.733
Old, wrinkly, tight butthole is what you are.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.984
Here. Take a rip.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.737
Wow, man.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.655
I'm so proud of you.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.074
You got it all figured out, man!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.993
-I do.
-That's what I'm talking about!

13:48.077 --> 13:49.328
So, like...

13:49.829 --> 13:52.122
Like... Like what's the secret?

13:52.248 --> 13:56.502
Well, it all started when Joe Rogan
became President of the...

14:00.298 --> 14:01.423
What are you... What are you doing?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.884
That thing was about to burn your face off.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.469
Oh...

14:08.014 --> 14:10.390
And if you ever let my wife chorg you,

14:10.475 --> 14:13.352
I'll have your head on a stick!

14:16.648 --> 14:18.023
Hey, what's chorg?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.107
Google it.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.118
- Let me out of this cage!
- Anders!

14:30.203 --> 14:31.203
Anders, stop it!

14:32.539 --> 14:35.207
Hi. I was a bird.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.584
There was a zookeeper.
He shot me, and he put me in this cage.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.086
- Just shut up right now!
- Wait a minute!

14:39.170 --> 14:41.630
Where's the kid?
Where's, uh, Jash?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.674
The kid, he went to his office.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.425
That door. Which is a closet.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.386
Hey, how is it going?

14:47.595 --> 14:48.804
Is everything okay with the kid?

14:49.597 --> 14:51.390
- Yeah. It's great.
- Yeah.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.183
This kid is so full of energy.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.103
- It's like, makes me feel young again.
- Yeah.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.313
- Oh, kids. Oh, man.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.524
They are so much fun when they're that age.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.484
-Yeah.
-When they're...

15:03.361 --> 15:04.444
-Four?
-No.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.863
Yeah, he's eight. So where the hell is he?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.574
Uh, he's...

15:09.492 --> 15:10.534
-He's hiding.
-Yeah.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.577
- He's... Shh.
Mmm-hmm.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.413
We're playing hide and seek,
and he's in that closet, so everything's...

15:14.998 --> 15:19.585
That door goes out to the parking lot,
you lunatics! Go find him!

15:19.836 --> 15:21.003
-Is it time?
-Seek time!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.337
-It's seek time!
-We be seekin'!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.589
It's seek time right now!

15:23.673 --> 15:24.756
Seekin' in the weekend.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.049
I got it, I got it.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.054
Just grab it, man.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.726
It's too fast, Alice.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.895
Alice, are we going
to your office?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.856
Uh, yep, I'll be right there, Dave.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.984
I got it! I got it!

15:44.068 --> 15:46.153
I got it, it's... The door, see?

15:46.237 --> 15:48.780
I have it, then we're gonna go
walk outside of it.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.783
Get him now!

15:53.745 --> 15:55.454
Gosh! Okay.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.874
Whoa!

16:02.045 --> 16:04.421
- There he is.
- Okay, uh, yeah.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.548
I guess we should try to
jump over to that island?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.842
No way, it's too far.
We're not gonna make it.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.302
Let's just go back, okay?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.511
-Good call, man.
-Good call.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.807
Son of a back door's gone!
The back door's gone!

16:15.892 --> 16:17.768
-Yep.
-Oh, I'm having a bad trip.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.062
Guys, we can at least try
and make this jump, right?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.313
Yeah. Heck, yeah. We got this, dude.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.815
-Psych up. Psych up, bro, we got this!
-What?

16:23.900 --> 16:27.110
On three, on three! One, two, three! I'm going!

16:29.405 --> 16:30.739
--Oh, my God.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.908
-The lava! The lava!
-My legs!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.910
Hey! Get off that!

16:35.036 --> 16:37.537
-Oh, shoot.
-Well, hey, we're tripping on peyote,

16:37.622 --> 16:38.997
-so what can you do, you know?
-Yeah.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.540
Get the fuck out of my cement.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.376
-You got it, you got it.
-Yep. Okay.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.919
Hey, hey, hey, over there. Come on.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.295
- Let's go, let's go!
- There's the kid.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.755
- Careful.
- Hey!

16:49.092 --> 16:50.133
Ow!

16:50.385 --> 16:51.802
Josh!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.471
- Come on! Josh?
- Jash!

16:54.722 --> 16:56.723
-Jash?
-All right, son, playtime's over.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.392
Come on out, okay?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.560
- Come on! Come on!
- Jash?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.020
Hey, there he is!

17:07.110 --> 17:09.361
-Okay, I'll go this way.
-I'm gonna get this one.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.445
Yeah. All right, I got him.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.447
Hey, Adam, I'm over here.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.783
Got you, dude!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.743
- You stupid!

17:17.120 --> 17:20.330
Have you guys seen Jash?
He's like this little kid I'm looking for.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.332
He's like nine or twelve.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.544
Hey, how 'bout you quit chasing
around little kids, come with me?

17:26.003 --> 17:28.922
We'll eat some, uh, Chicago deep-dish pizza!

17:29.215 --> 17:32.718
-That sounds good.
-It's like God jizzed in your mouth.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.803
-What? You wanna be God, dude?
-I can't, I can't.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.639
Freakin' bone a bunch of chicks on camera

17:37.724 --> 17:41.226
and have a million dudes beat off to you, bro!

17:41.310 --> 17:42.310
I don't think so!

17:42.395 --> 17:45.188
That does sound awesome. The first part.
The second part, I'm...

17:45.940 --> 17:47.065
The second part's cool.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.984
You wanna be worshipped, Adam?

17:49.485 --> 17:52.696
Come play jazz fest with me tonight.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.115
That sounds... That sounds cool, but I'm...
I am busy.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.199
I love crawfish, though.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.493
Josh? Josh, where are you?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.454
-Oh!
-Hey, hey.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.872
It's all good. Come here.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.749
Hey, what's up, old me?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.501
Have you seen that little dude run by?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.711
I'm getting kinda worried about him.

18:08.004 --> 18:11.089
Hey, Ders will handle it, man.
Quit being a bitch.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.216
Don't you wanna know
what it's all about, huh?

18:14.635 --> 18:15.677
Josh, where are you?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.305
Hey, come fly with me.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.390
No, no, I can't. I gotta find Josh.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.017
No, forget that. Let's go fly, man.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.478
We'll go to the beach.
We'll, like, crap on people's heads

18:24.562 --> 18:26.354
and steal chicks' bikinis!

18:26.856 --> 18:28.315
That actually sounds kind of awesome.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.941
It's very satisfying.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.402
Come on, I wanna tell you
what it's all about, man.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.196
Hell, yeah. Hell...

18:34.280 --> 18:35.822
No! No, no, no, no.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.282
-No, stop! Shut up!
-Come on!

18:37.366 --> 18:39.451
Don't be a bitch. Smoke a doobie with me.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.204
That sounds awesome, okay? But I can't!

18:42.288 --> 18:43.288
You little pussy!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.790
I already know what the meaning
of life is about.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.082
The meaning of life is...

18:46.209 --> 18:48.543
Why don't you go wash your pussy, pussy?

18:48.711 --> 18:52.631
Is finding that kid right now, 'cause, yeah,
I don't wanna prove Alice right again, man.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.758
I'm not an irresponsible idiot, okay?

18:54.842 --> 18:58.261
What? Responsible? Okay!
Suck my balls, all right?

18:58.346 --> 18:59.971
-Come with me, bro!
-Come on, my brother.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.849
-Come on, dude.
-Don't make me!

19:03.309 --> 19:05.644
I may be an irresponsible idiot,

19:05.770 --> 19:07.729
and I'm definitely an idiot,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.231
but I'm not about to show that to Alice.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.233
I do... I disagree with that.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.109
Guys, I know what we have to do!

19:13.945 --> 19:15.195
We gotta break the mirrors.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.198
Dude, do not break the mirror.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.951
- Be prepared to be broken!
- No!

19:21.035 --> 19:22.035
Stop it!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.079
Don't, bro! I mean it, bro!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.831
Look what I found.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.750
-Don't make me come after you!
-No! But watch it, bro!

19:30.044 --> 19:31.336
- Don't break me!
- Sorry, boys.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.754
You gotta fly solo on this one,

19:32.839 --> 19:34.673
- because...
- Don't break me!

19:34.757 --> 19:35.799
Do not break me!

19:35.883 --> 19:37.425
You have no power over me.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.594
- Don't!

19:40.680 --> 19:41.805
Hey, no!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.098
Oh, no, bro!

19:43.933 --> 19:45.183
Oh, no, baby.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.482
Yes!

19:53.109 --> 19:54.734
I'm gonna need back-up!

20:02.702 --> 20:04.828
-Get ready to be impressed.
-Whoo!

20:04.912 --> 20:06.454
'Cause you are gonna love...

20:06.539 --> 20:07.789
Oh.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.624
Hey! Hola!

20:10.042 --> 20:11.293
What up?

20:11.419 --> 20:16.172
Uh, what the hell happened to all these
mirrors that I just sold to Mr. Gainey

20:16.257 --> 20:17.716
for a huge sale?

20:18.009 --> 20:19.384
Oh, my God.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.219
Where's that little monster?

20:22.096 --> 20:23.138
Did he cause this?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.390
-Well, you know...
-Uh...

20:25.474 --> 20:27.017
We were playing hide and go seek,

20:27.101 --> 20:29.102
and, you know, Josh was running
around and, uh...

20:29.186 --> 20:31.771
-We were all running around...
-Everybody was running. It was seek time...

20:31.856 --> 20:33.023
I didn't do this.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.107
I'm not talking to you.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.484
Look at this! God!

20:36.861 --> 20:37.944
Alice...

20:38.571 --> 20:40.655
I'm really sorry about these mirrors, okay?

20:41.699 --> 20:42.824
I'm gonna pay for all of them.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.117
Oh...

20:45.161 --> 20:46.745
I'm sorry this had to happen.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.539
Yeah, well, not as sorry as he's gonna be.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.583
- This trip is dark, dude.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.709
Good for nothing!

20:55.838 --> 20:56.880
Hit bongs!

21:02.345 --> 21:04.346
Gotta really cook it, you know?

21:04.889 --> 21:07.515
Gotta make sure it's nice and crispy.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.434
Other than that,

21:09.894 --> 21:11.603
make sure the turkey's done.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.229
Know what I mean?

21:13.314 --> 21:16.524
Don't wanna serve Thanksgiving
dinner without the stuffing.
