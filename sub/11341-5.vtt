No.
No.

00:13.959 --> 00:14.695
Come on.

00:14.696 --> 00:16.079
No, stop, no.

00:16.113 --> 00:17.562
Relax.

00:17.564 --> 00:18.864
Please stop. Stop!

00:18.866 --> 00:20.365
I said stop!

00:21.901 --> 00:23.235
You little bitch.

00:23.237 --> 00:24.586
Aah!

00:27.573 --> 00:28.790
Aah!

00:28.792 --> 00:30.542
Oh, my God!

00:30.544 --> 00:31.927
Aah!

00:33.579 --> 00:35.597
Please stop!
You're hurting him!

00:35.599 --> 00:37.716
Please, please stop!

00:37.718 --> 00:39.218
Dad?

00:49.595 --> 00:51.313
No.

00:59.656 --> 01:02.040
Hey, Jessica, it's me.
I'm sorry, I dozed off.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.575
Um, is everything all right?

01:04.578 --> 01:07.162
Ok. Jack's all right?

01:08.214 --> 01:10.382
Great. Um...

01:10.384 --> 01:12.568
I should be there
in about a half an hour, ok?

01:12.570 --> 01:15.888
Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

01:29.602 --> 01:31.136
Hey, it's me again.

01:31.138 --> 01:33.522
I'm--I'm not gonna make it.

01:33.524 --> 01:36.992
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

01:36.994 --> 01:38.443
I just put in new brakes.

01:38.445 --> 01:39.811
She's running like a dream.

01:39.813 --> 01:42.314
I always admired the aesthetic
of the classic Torpedo C body,

01:42.316 --> 01:43.582
especially in the 1947.

01:43.584 --> 01:45.417
They just don't make them
like that anymore.

01:45.419 --> 01:47.586
Yeah, well, I'm lucky
to have found it.

01:47.588 --> 01:49.171
Uncle sal would be proud.

01:49.173 --> 01:51.489
Thank you for coming in, everyone.
We can get started.

01:51.491 --> 01:53.508
Ok. Guys,
meet Samantha Wilcox,

01:53.510 --> 01:56.178
16-year-old junior
in Wichita, Kansas.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.163
Last night she snuck out
with her boyfriend,

01:58.165 --> 02:00.849
they were attacked,
she hasn't been seen since.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.968
Boyfriend got a broken
jaw and a concussion.

02:02.970 --> 02:04.303
And the description
of the attacker

02:04.305 --> 02:05.520
matches her father,
Eddie Lee Wilcox.

02:05.522 --> 02:06.605
Ex-con.

02:06.607 --> 02:08.473
Oh, is he ever.
Still on parole.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.159
Eddie is a car thief and
wheel man extraordinaire.

02:11.161 --> 02:13.011
String of assault
charges, too.

02:13.013 --> 02:14.846
Been in and out
of jail since he was a kid.

02:14.848 --> 02:15.981
We don't usually work

02:15.983 --> 02:17.899
parental abduction cases.

02:17.901 --> 02:20.652
We do when the abduction's
violent and dad's a former convict.

02:20.654 --> 02:23.121
He hasn't been incarcerated
in over 3 years.

02:23.123 --> 02:26.658
I mean he's had ample opportunity.
Why pick yesterday to kidnap her?

02:26.660 --> 02:28.493
Well, he beat the boyfriend
within an inch of his life to do it,

02:28.495 --> 02:30.162
so taking her had to be
real important.

02:30.164 --> 02:32.381
And apparently Eddie
was none too pleased

02:32.383 --> 02:34.950
that Samantha's mom melody
had decided to remarry

02:34.952 --> 02:37.002
and then move
from Chicago to Wichita.

02:37.004 --> 02:40.138
He lost visitation rights
the last time he got locked up.

02:40.140 --> 02:41.974
So the anger about that
is the stressor

02:41.976 --> 02:43.375
that builds up
over the years.

02:43.377 --> 02:45.010
Last night he decides
to do something about it.

02:45.012 --> 02:47.229
This could be vengeance for taking
his daughter away.

02:47.231 --> 02:48.730
If it's revenge
against the mother,

02:48.732 --> 02:50.849
he'll either hurt Samantha
or disappear with her.

02:50.851 --> 02:52.851
She's been missing
for over 5 hours,

02:52.853 --> 02:55.220
and we know how time sensitive
these cases are.

02:55.222 --> 02:57.189
The AMBER Alert
is expanding?

02:57.191 --> 02:59.557
Every hour...

02:59.559 --> 03:01.493
Excuse me.

03:01.495 --> 03:03.578
Aaron!
Hotch!

03:48.367 --> 03:49.717
Mr. Hotchner?

03:49.719 --> 03:51.786
Mr. Hotchner,
can you hear me?

03:51.788 --> 03:53.755
He's not responding.
Pulse is thready.

03:53.757 --> 03:55.289
Starting lactated ringers,
wide open.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.924
Systolic's dropping.
BP's 90 over 60.

03:56.926 --> 03:59.977
You stay with me,
Mr. Hotchner. Ok?

03:59.979 --> 04:01.295
Stay with me.

04:08.637 --> 04:10.605
Bleeding internally
from what?

04:10.607 --> 04:13.241
They think it's probably
all the scar tissue.

04:13.243 --> 04:14.659
Torn adhesions
from the stab wounds.

04:14.661 --> 04:16.527
George Foyet returns
from the grave.

04:16.529 --> 04:18.379
What's
the prognosis?

04:18.380 --> 04:19.980
He's stable right now.
Did an ultrasound,

04:19.982 --> 04:21.332
but can't seem to see

04:21.334 --> 04:23.401
exactly where the bleeding
was coming from.

04:23.403 --> 04:24.535
He'll need an exploratory
laparotomy.

04:24.537 --> 04:25.670
Does Jack know?

04:25.672 --> 04:27.188
Not yet. I talked to
Haley's sister Jessica.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.589
We didn't want to worry
the little guy.

04:28.591 --> 04:29.941
What about Beth?

04:29.943 --> 04:32.710
I left a message, but she's
on a business trip in Milan.

04:32.712 --> 04:35.129
Look, I know you're all
worried. So am I.

04:35.131 --> 04:37.131
But a teenage girl
has been abducted,

04:37.133 --> 04:40.468
and Hotch would want us
to focus on the case, not on him.

04:40.470 --> 04:42.336
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

04:42.338 --> 04:45.306
When the plane
lands, Morgan, JJ,

04:45.308 --> 04:47.525
I want you to interview
Samantha Wilcox's mother.

04:47.527 --> 04:50.010
Reid, Blake, you go check out
the abduction site.

04:50.012 --> 04:52.830
I'm catching the the next
flight to Wichita and I'll meet you there.

04:52.832 --> 04:54.282
What about Hotch?

04:54.284 --> 04:56.567
Garcia's here.
She's not going anywhere.

04:56.569 --> 04:59.403
Now, let's go find
this girl.

05:06.662 --> 05:08.529
Hey.

05:08.531 --> 05:10.030
Breakfast.

05:13.168 --> 05:15.887
Come on, I know
you're not sleeping.

05:15.889 --> 05:18.256
What, are you gonna
ignore me forever?

05:18.258 --> 05:19.724
I said I was sorry.

05:19.726 --> 05:21.726
Oh, come on, Sammy.

05:21.728 --> 05:24.011
Don't call me that.

05:26.932 --> 05:28.382
Where are we?

05:28.384 --> 05:30.384
Texas.

05:30.386 --> 05:31.886
Granola bar?

05:31.888 --> 05:33.554
Can we stop and get
a McMuffin or something?

05:33.556 --> 05:35.439
Maybe later when
we stop for gas.

05:35.441 --> 05:37.525
When's that?
I need coffee.

05:37.527 --> 05:39.560
A couple of hours.
You drink coffee now?

05:39.562 --> 05:42.246
Yes. And I hate granola.

05:43.332 --> 05:44.999
You gonna talk to me?

05:46.668 --> 05:50.204
I cannot believe
you did that.

05:50.206 --> 05:53.341
I know. I'm sorry.
I lost my temper.

05:53.343 --> 05:55.743
You just showed up.
You should have called or something.

05:55.745 --> 05:57.962
I didn't even have time
to say goodbye to my friends.

05:57.964 --> 06:00.681
How many times you
want me to apologize?

06:00.683 --> 06:03.267
I am sorry.

06:03.269 --> 06:06.587
But there's nothing I can do
to change it now. Ok?

06:08.924 --> 06:10.308
No?

06:10.310 --> 06:12.259
All right, then.

06:15.564 --> 06:17.565
We had a deal.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.734
You wanted out
of Wichita, here we are.

06:19.736 --> 06:23.654
But you gotta lose the 'tude or
we're never gonna make it.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.793
Angel,  I swear,,

06:28.795 --> 06:30.878
you are gonna love it
down there.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.830
Ocean breezes.

06:32.832 --> 06:35.466
Sunny every day.

06:36.668 --> 06:39.804
Nowhere near Wichita.

06:46.562 --> 06:49.313
That's my girl.

06:49.315 --> 06:51.515
He's just one of those guys,
you know?

06:51.517 --> 06:53.434
He makes you feel special.

06:53.436 --> 06:56.487
You think you can change him,
but he never does.

06:56.489 --> 06:58.806
Were you aware of Eddie's
criminal background?

06:58.808 --> 07:00.825
He told me
he was a mechanic.

07:00.827 --> 07:03.828
I thought all those new cars
were part of his job.

07:03.830 --> 07:06.330
But after a while
I noticed things.

07:06.332 --> 07:07.481
Like what?

07:07.483 --> 07:09.200
His sketchy friends. Um,

07:09.202 --> 07:11.752
sometimes he'd be gone
for days and then suddenly

07:11.754 --> 07:13.287
he'd have all this cash.

07:13.289 --> 07:16.340
Was he ever violent
with you?

07:17.259 --> 07:19.010
He's got a bad temper.

07:19.012 --> 07:20.795
What about with Samantha?

07:20.797 --> 07:22.546
He wasn't around enough.

07:22.548 --> 07:24.015
He got locked up
when she was 6

07:24.017 --> 07:25.433
and didn't
get out until she was 13.

07:25.435 --> 07:27.385
After that I moved.

07:27.387 --> 07:29.520
But I wasn't the one
who told him.

07:29.522 --> 07:31.105
Sam was.

07:31.107 --> 07:32.273
So they were in touch.

07:32.275 --> 07:33.691
How often were they
in contact?

07:33.693 --> 07:34.859
I don't know.

07:34.861 --> 07:36.644
She doesn't tell me anything.

07:36.646 --> 07:38.529
We fight all the time.

07:38.531 --> 07:41.849
I--I thought it was because
she's a teenager, but--

07:41.851 --> 07:44.035
You can't blame yourself.
You did everything you could

07:44.037 --> 07:45.686
to try to keep her safe.

07:45.688 --> 07:48.706
I did all that because
I've always been scared

07:48.708 --> 07:51.575
she's too much like him.

08:03.138 --> 08:04.822
Get him into O.R. 2
right away.

08:04.824 --> 08:06.040
Yes, Doctor.

08:07.977 --> 08:08.960
Hey, Morgan.

08:08.962 --> 08:10.294
How is he?

08:10.296 --> 08:12.480
He's still out. They're
taking him to surgery now.

08:12.482 --> 08:14.849
Listen, we need those
big old brains of yours if you're ready.

08:14.851 --> 08:15.900
Born ready.

08:15.902 --> 08:17.384
All right, we need you
to check out

08:17.386 --> 08:19.937
all of Samantha Wilcox's
texts and email correspondence.

08:19.939 --> 08:22.740
Ok. What am I looking for?
Anything in particular?

08:22.742 --> 08:24.558
She's been in touch
with her dad on the D.L.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.910
There might be something
in there.

08:25.912 --> 08:28.329
Oh, and check ViCAP
for any recent armed robberies

08:28.331 --> 08:31.699
between Wichita and Eddie Lee Wilcox's
last known address in Chicago.

08:31.701 --> 08:32.832
Why?

08:32.835 --> 08:34.284
Well, according
to Samantha's mom,

08:34.287 --> 08:35.919
Eddie may have been
more than a car thief.

08:35.922 --> 08:37.004
How much more?

08:37.006 --> 08:39.173
Armed robber more.
He may be running

08:39.174 --> 08:40.591
from something work related.

08:40.592 --> 08:43.177
Got you. They just wheeled Hotch
into the surgery right now.

08:43.179 --> 08:44.211
All right, keep us posted.

08:44.212 --> 08:45.412
You know I will.

08:46.915 --> 08:48.599
We should swing east
and hit New Orleans.

08:48.601 --> 08:49.967
It's supposed
to be awesome.

08:49.969 --> 08:51.585
Yeah, it's overrated.

08:51.587 --> 08:53.437
Come on,
it'll be so much fun.

08:53.439 --> 08:55.806
And I can help drive
'cause I'm in Drivers Ed.

08:55.808 --> 08:59.560
No time. Job starts
in two days with or without me.

09:02.531 --> 09:04.732
Then how about Padre Island?

09:04.734 --> 09:06.734
It looks pretty
and it's on the way.

09:08.704 --> 09:10.437
What?

09:12.824 --> 09:16.961
Nothin'. I just can't believe
how grown up you got.

09:17.879 --> 09:20.247
I missed you, too.

09:27.222 --> 09:29.640
What? What's wrong?

09:29.642 --> 09:31.342
No, no, no, no, no.

09:31.344 --> 09:32.960
Don't turn around

09:32.962 --> 09:35.846
and don't slouch.
Just sit up and act normal.

09:35.848 --> 09:37.348
I told you you shouldn't
have beat him up so bad.

09:37.350 --> 09:38.933
Now you're probably wanted.

09:38.935 --> 09:41.468
Oh, my God, Dad,
what are you doing?

09:41.470 --> 09:43.354
Relax. Everything's
gonna be ok.

09:53.481 --> 09:56.150
What? You were gonna
shoot a cop?

09:56.152 --> 09:58.485
No. Of course not.

09:58.487 --> 10:02.006
Glove box is the first
place they check.

10:02.008 --> 10:03.507
Can I see it?

10:03.509 --> 10:05.626
You ever handle a gun?

10:05.628 --> 10:06.660
No.

10:06.662 --> 10:08.796
Then there's your answer.

10:08.798 --> 10:10.631
This place is off
the beaten path.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.716
Her mother said
she snuck out late.

10:12.718 --> 10:14.835
He must have followed her here
from her house.

10:14.837 --> 10:17.471
Which suggests he may not
have planned the abduction.

10:17.473 --> 10:20.107
He just waited
for the right opportunity.

10:20.942 --> 10:22.977
Look at this.

10:22.979 --> 10:24.862
She left her cell phone behind.

10:24.864 --> 10:26.397
Odd for a teenage girl.

10:26.399 --> 10:28.015
Maybe she lost it
in the struggle.

10:28.017 --> 10:29.283
Or it's a forensic
countermeasure

10:29.285 --> 10:31.185
so they can't be tracked
with the GPS.

10:31.187 --> 10:33.571
Garcia got a hit on ViCAP.
The day before yesterday

10:33.573 --> 10:36.157
two masked gunman robbed
a pawn shop in Chicago.

10:36.159 --> 10:37.708
25k in cash and jewels
were stolen.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.493
The owner and a customer
were shot dead.

10:39.495 --> 10:42.880
And so was one of the gunmen, except
he was shot 8 times with a .45.

10:42.882 --> 10:45.199
Emptied the magazine.
Overkill?

10:45.201 --> 10:46.300
You think our guy's
the shooter?

10:46.302 --> 10:48.169
The dead gunman
was one Christopher Corbone.

10:48.171 --> 10:51.371
He spent 6 years in the same cell block
with Eddie Lee Wilcox.

10:51.373 --> 10:52.473
They were partners.

10:52.475 --> 10:54.041
And Corbone was heavily
connected to the Riggio

10:54.043 --> 10:57.211
family in Chicago.
Mid-level Mafioso thug.

10:57.213 --> 10:58.896
Sounds like
a double-cross.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.981
If he double-crossed his partner,
he's not just on the run from the law,

11:00.983 --> 11:02.483
he could also be running
from the mob.

11:02.485 --> 11:04.568
That explains why the need to grab
his daughter was so urgent.

11:04.570 --> 11:06.270
With good guys and bad guys
on his tail,

11:06.272 --> 11:07.822
he has to know
that this doesn't end well.

11:07.824 --> 11:09.907
It doesn't make sense.
If he loves her so much,

11:09.909 --> 11:11.725
why put her in
this type of jeopardy?

11:11.727 --> 11:13.527
His desperation's
making him irrational.

11:13.529 --> 11:16.080
He's gonna
get dangerous if he gets cornered.

11:19.901 --> 11:22.036
I can't tell for sure,

11:22.038 --> 11:25.372
but I'm almost positive
it's that fella on the news.

11:25.374 --> 11:28.726
Yes, sir. Can you describe
the vehicle he's driving?

11:33.865 --> 11:36.834
How much longer
till we get there?

11:36.836 --> 11:39.637
Uh, not long.
A few more hours.

11:39.639 --> 11:43.423
A few as in like
3 or like 7?

11:44.559 --> 11:47.261
Yeah. Yeah, he sure is.

11:53.535 --> 11:56.370
I need a shower.
I stink.

11:56.372 --> 11:59.373
It would have been nice if I could
have packed a change of clothes.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.376
I want you to take a walk
to that diner up the road.

12:02.378 --> 12:03.994
Grab us some sandwiches,
a couple slices of pie.

12:03.996 --> 12:06.413
Can't we just drive there
when we get done?

12:06.415 --> 12:07.748
We shouldn't be seen
together.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.501
Plus I gotta hit the head, number 2.
It might take a while.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.786
Ok, ok. But way
too much information.

12:16.624 --> 12:17.892
What do you want?

12:17.894 --> 12:20.394
Surprise me.

12:24.683 --> 12:26.901
Hey, the girl just went
and walked off.

12:26.903 --> 12:29.486
Is he leaving with her?

12:29.488 --> 12:33.941
He looks like he's going around
back to the bathroom.

12:33.943 --> 12:35.609
All right, sir.
You sit tight.

12:35.611 --> 12:38.412
We have state patrol units
en route to you. Don't try any--

12:40.533 --> 12:42.666
Hello?

12:42.668 --> 12:44.484
Hello?

12:44.486 --> 12:46.587
Hey. Hey, you there?

12:48.991 --> 12:50.674
Whew.

12:50.676 --> 12:52.843
Hotter than hell out there.

12:52.845 --> 12:55.279
Yeah, that time of year.

12:55.281 --> 12:57.097
Yeah.

12:57.966 --> 13:00.184
Uh...

13:16.701 --> 13:19.019
That comes to $6.00 even.

13:50.551 --> 13:52.319
Pulse is stable at 86.

13:52.321 --> 13:53.854
Retractor, please.

13:54.689 --> 13:57.074
Is it true what I heard
about this guy?

13:57.076 --> 14:00.828
Yeah. Serial killer
almost stabbed him to death.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.529
Crazy, huh?

14:02.531 --> 14:05.165
Let's have 4 units
of 0-neg on hold.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.515
Hi, honey.

15:11.517 --> 15:13.600
I saved you a seat.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.318
No news on Hotch yet.

15:36.319 --> 15:39.687
Samantha Wilcox was in touch
with her dad a lot.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.205
I got their texts right here.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.489
May I?

15:42.491 --> 15:44.825
Yeah.
Thanks.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.827
"I hate my life.
Mom's a bitch.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.779
"Hubby's a tool,
and Wichita blows.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.130
Why can't I live
with you?"

15:50.132 --> 15:51.448
Then dad responds in kind,

15:51.450 --> 15:53.116
"love you lots.
We'll be together soon."

15:53.118 --> 15:55.085
She wanted him
to come get her.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.337
Yeah, what if they planned it?

15:56.339 --> 15:57.972
I don't know.
I'm not seeing anything

15:57.974 --> 16:01.458
logistical in nature here.
It's all emotional outbursts at her mom

16:01.460 --> 16:02.893
and little loving
missives to her dad.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.763
I doubt if she had anything
to do with this, though.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.965
Name's Damon Turner,
54-year-old widower,

16:07.967 --> 16:11.635
father of 3, and apparently
he was expecting is first grandchild.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.237
No security cameras.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.772
He had a shotgun
stashed back there.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.023
I wonder why
he didn't use it.

16:16.025 --> 16:18.075
Eddie must have gotten the jump on
him before he could.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.977
Guy recognizes Eddie,
calls 911.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.312
Eddie clocks it,
caps him to shut him up.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.697
But the damage
is already done.

16:23.699 --> 16:26.166
He already made the call.
Why kill him?

16:26.168 --> 16:28.002
Why didn't Eddie
just take off?

16:28.004 --> 16:30.371
He's in survival mode. He'll try
to eliminate any perceived threats.

16:30.373 --> 16:31.789
He didn't rob the place.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.874
He left all the cash
in the register.

16:33.876 --> 16:36.710
He didn't have to. He had money from
the Chicago robberies.

16:36.712 --> 16:38.328
Actually, I think he may have.
Look at this.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.881
Several items were rung up
after the 911 call.

16:40.883 --> 16:44.385
A bag of chips, a pack of gum,
and 6 post cards.

16:44.387 --> 16:47.090
Post cards? What does he want,
a souvenir?

16:47.091 --> 16:48.339
It's possible. He knows if
he gets caught,

16:48.364 --> 16:50.320
he's going away for a long time,
and being with his daughter

16:50.321 --> 16:52.162
may have evoke a need to
commemorate the event.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.528
But post cards are old school.

16:54.530 --> 16:57.848
Being with his daughter might actually
make him nostalgic in some way.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.183
Well, he's headed due south,
most likely straight to Mexico.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.151
He'll stick to side roads

17:01.176 --> 17:03.211
and won't cross the border
anywhere busy.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.872
I'll extend
the AMBER Alert

17:04.874 --> 17:07.357
and have Highway Patrol
set up roadblocks.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.127
Pulse is stable
at 86.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.161
Mm-hmm.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.796
More suction, please.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.381
Yes, doctor.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.981
You look so beautiful.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.885
You're not so bad yourself.

17:38.823 --> 17:41.191
I miss you.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.893
I know.

17:45.363 --> 17:47.998
Ooh, it's starting.

17:50.118 --> 17:52.903
Oh, look how happy he is.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.658
Who's that?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.044
Her name is Beth.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.750
He's gotten so big.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.353
Hmm.

18:10.438 --> 18:13.924
Oh, she's really good-looking.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.610
She's not you.

18:16.612 --> 18:18.762
And I'm not enough.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.447
Oh, stop beating
yourself up.

18:20.449 --> 18:23.033
You're a great dad.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.619
You always have been.

18:27.622 --> 18:29.990
It's hard.

18:29.992 --> 18:31.575
And I'm alone.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.877
No, you're not.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.946
Jack misses you, too.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.749
Well, then you should
talk about me more.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.451
You should talk more,
period.

18:43.788 --> 18:47.007
He's not like you.

18:47.009 --> 18:50.094
He needs to hear
the words.

18:52.814 --> 18:55.599
Ohh! Go! Go.

18:55.601 --> 18:56.567
Go! Go!

18:56.569 --> 19:00.187
Goal!

19:00.189 --> 19:01.638
Oh!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.857
Ohh...

19:04.776 --> 19:06.360
As you all know,

19:06.362 --> 19:08.128
Eddie Lee Wilcox
is armed and dangerous.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.497
He's also smart and
criminally sophisticated.

19:10.499 --> 19:12.533
He knows police procedure
and how to use it.

19:12.535 --> 19:14.468
He's flush with cash
from his robbery in Chicago,

19:14.470 --> 19:16.620
but he'll try to maintain
a low profile,

19:16.622 --> 19:18.956
so he may resort to his
robbery skills at some point.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.275
Eddie's a car thief
and he's a good one.

19:21.277 --> 19:22.593
So he'll switch
vehicles often.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.545
He was last seen
in a Chevy minivan,

19:24.547 --> 19:27.047
but we do not count on him
being in it for long.

19:27.049 --> 19:29.166
So canvass crowded
parking lots and malls.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.501
That's most likely where he'll
ditch cars and find new ones.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.303
We've been calling this
a child abduction,

19:33.305 --> 19:36.773
but Eddie's daughter Samantha
may actually be an unwitting participant.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.109
We know she wanted
to run away from home,

19:39.111 --> 19:41.344
and her father is somehow
taking advantage of that.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.680
This guy's evolved
into a sociopathic spree killer,

19:43.682 --> 19:45.315
and he's got the ego
of a career criminal,

19:45.317 --> 19:47.350
so there's no telling
how far he'll go to save himself.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.120
That ego may be feeding
a sort of pipe dream,

19:50.122 --> 19:52.573
that if he does escape,
he may actually

19:52.575 --> 19:55.125
get to have a healthy
relationship with his daughter.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.494
A relationship
he believes was taken from him.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.363
But when reality sets in,
his dream will be shattered,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.417
and that's when Samantha
will be in the most danger.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.464
The majority of these cases

20:03.489 --> 20:06.002
end in either murder/suicide
or suicide by cop.

20:06.889 --> 20:09.640
Up to this point,
we've been reacting to him,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.258
but the roadblocks
and the media blitz

20:11.260 --> 20:13.477
are set up to make him
react to us.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.262
So if you spot him,
call for backup

20:15.264 --> 20:16.813
and proceed
with extreme caution.

20:16.815 --> 20:19.516
He's probably sleep
deprived and irrational.

20:19.518 --> 20:22.236
The closer we get,
the more dangerous he becomes.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.664
We have an AMBER
Alert for 16-year-old

20:33.666 --> 20:35.532
Samantha Renee Wilcox
of Wichita.

20:35.534 --> 20:39.152
Samantha was allegedly abducted
by her father, Eddie Lee Wilcox,

20:39.154 --> 20:41.838
who is wanted in connection
with a robbery in Chicago

20:41.840 --> 20:44.074
that claimed the lives
of 3 victims.

20:58.856 --> 21:00.541
Sam! What are you doing?!

21:00.542 --> 21:02.609
I was calling mom.
They don't think that I ran away.

21:02.611 --> 21:03.610
They think
you kidnapped me.

21:03.611 --> 21:04.565
No, no, no, no, no.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.130
We talked about this.
You can't call anybody.

21:06.131 --> 21:07.631
I just wanted to let
her know I was ok.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.249
How long were you
on the phone?

21:09.251 --> 21:10.884
Is it true?

21:10.886 --> 21:12.219
Did you tell her
where we were?

21:12.221 --> 21:13.971
Did you kill those people?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.973
What?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.391
I saw it on the news.

21:17.393 --> 21:19.643
Get dressed.
No, no, answer my question!

21:19.645 --> 21:21.428
I'll tell you everything
in the car, but we gotta go.

21:21.430 --> 21:22.562
No, please,
just tell me the truth.

21:22.564 --> 21:25.599
Now, Sam! Now! Go!

21:32.907 --> 21:34.691
This guy's not coming.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.693
Mm, we really haven't
been here that long.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.695
Yeah, but if he wanted
to make a run for the border,

21:38.697 --> 21:40.614
he'd have been caught
in the net by now.

21:40.616 --> 21:42.666
Maybe we made him
switch directions.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.167
Well, we can't cover
everything. Texas is huge.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.920
268,581 square miles,
to be exact.

21:46.922 --> 21:48.321
Largest state
in the contiguous 48

21:48.323 --> 21:50.323
and the second-most populous.
Don't mess with Texas.

21:50.325 --> 21:53.159
Hey, you want to read?
I always do when I'm anxious.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.014
"The Magical Mathematics
of Quantum Physics."

21:57.016 --> 21:58.849
Ohh. Nope.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.468
I'm good. I'll wait
for the movie.

22:05.189 --> 22:06.807
Here. Put your hair up.

22:06.809 --> 22:09.192
You said you would explain
when we got in the car.

22:09.194 --> 22:12.279
We're in the car.
Whoever's car this is.

22:12.281 --> 22:13.814
I didn't do what
they said that I did.

22:13.816 --> 22:15.482
Then what did you do?

22:15.484 --> 22:16.483
Ah, jeez--I, uh--

22:16.485 --> 22:17.701
my partner went crazy.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.152
I was lucky
to get out alive.

22:19.154 --> 22:20.404
What happened?

22:20.406 --> 22:22.939
It all went down so quick
and didn't have choice,

22:22.941 --> 22:24.858
but I never should have
trusted him.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.026
Did you kill anyone?

22:26.028 --> 22:27.494
Sam--
Did you kill anyone?!

22:27.496 --> 22:28.996
Sam!

22:28.998 --> 22:30.497
Look...

22:30.499 --> 22:32.249
Everything that I am doing

22:32.251 --> 22:34.051
I am doing for us.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.387
Everything's gonna be ok
when we get to Mexico.

22:37.389 --> 22:39.089
You just gotta trust me.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.924
Can you do that?

22:40.926 --> 22:41.975
Yes.

22:41.977 --> 22:42.976
That's my girl.

22:42.978 --> 22:45.062
Now please
put the hat on, ok?

22:45.064 --> 22:46.212
Break 1-9.

22:46.214 --> 22:48.398
Anybody with their ears on,
we got 1043s

22:48.400 --> 22:49.900
on every boulevard
due south.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.819
Smokeys are checkin' brakes.
Be advised.

22:52.821 --> 22:55.522
10-4, neighbor,
thanks for the holler.

22:55.524 --> 22:56.556
Damn it!

22:56.558 --> 22:57.941
What?

22:57.943 --> 22:59.993
Change of plan.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.535
Thanks so much.

23:10.121 --> 23:11.905
Hey, what you got,
good-lookin'?

23:11.907 --> 23:13.206
Still nothing on Hotch.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.292
I have a sort of something
on Samantha Wilcox.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.471
She just called her mom
from a motel in Odessa,

23:17.496 --> 23:18.346
but they weren't...

23:18.347 --> 23:19.629
That's only 103 miles
west of here.

23:19.631 --> 23:20.764
Alert local PD.
We're on our way.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.415
Wait, wait, wait.
I already did that.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.935
I called the police and Samantha
and her dad are nowhere to be seen.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.103
Sorry, sugar.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.604
He won't like the idea
of her calling home.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.723
That phone call will probably drive
a wedge between the two of them.

23:29.725 --> 23:31.926
We're close and he knows it.
Maybe he'll make a mistake.

23:35.646 --> 23:36.947
What are we doing?

23:36.949 --> 23:40.317
We need a new car.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.985
Sit tight.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.621
Ok.

23:58.636 --> 24:00.637
Hey!

24:00.639 --> 24:02.789
What the hell you doin'?!

24:07.428 --> 24:10.130
What do you think
you're doin'?!

24:15.020 --> 24:16.653
Uhh!

24:20.641 --> 24:21.825
S-Sam!

24:21.827 --> 24:23.777
Sam!
Oh, please...

24:23.779 --> 24:25.829
Sam!

24:25.831 --> 24:27.831
Get the bag.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.749
Get the bag. Go!

24:29.751 --> 24:31.751
Uh-huh.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.264
Get in the truck.
You drive.

24:44.266 --> 24:45.849
Drive. Go, go.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.684
Ok.

24:54.475 --> 24:56.476
Look at this.

24:56.478 --> 24:58.145
It's messier
than we thought.

24:58.147 --> 24:59.345
Bovie catheter.

24:59.347 --> 25:00.647
Yes, Doctor.

25:03.735 --> 25:05.719
Whoa, pressure's dropping.
80 over 50.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.757
She's cute.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.010
Excuse me.

25:30.012 --> 25:32.312
Ah...Sorry.

25:32.314 --> 25:34.264
Ooh, ooh, pardon me.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.149
Oh--

25:36.151 --> 25:37.150
Ahh.

25:37.152 --> 25:39.052
I hope I didn't
miss anything.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.937
What's he doing here?

25:40.939 --> 25:43.323
Oh, it's ok.
I invited him.

25:43.325 --> 25:44.574
Wowza.

25:44.576 --> 25:46.826
She is hot.

25:46.828 --> 25:48.228
Mm. Isn't she?

25:48.230 --> 25:50.614
I would tear that up.

25:50.616 --> 25:53.750
Hey, I bet she's a real
tiger in the sack, huh?

25:53.752 --> 25:55.285
Ha ha ha ha!
Ooh, popcorn?

25:55.287 --> 25:56.286
No.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.621
Would you like some?

25:57.623 --> 25:59.422
Mm. Yes, thank you.

26:02.426 --> 26:04.628
Oh.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.674
Ah, he's in V-fib.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.850
Pressure's still dropping.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.435
Get the paddles ready.
Charge to 150.

26:29.808 --> 26:31.441
Charging to 150.

26:32.651 --> 26:33.930
Clear.

26:33.931 --> 26:35.247
Haley!

26:35.249 --> 26:36.548
No, no, no, no.
I need more pressure.

26:36.550 --> 26:38.600
Somebody help me!
Help me, please!

26:38.602 --> 26:40.302
Would you pipe down
a little bit?

26:40.304 --> 26:41.970
Haley, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

26:41.972 --> 26:43.856
Oh, my God. Come on.

26:43.858 --> 26:45.107
I can't stop the bleeding.

26:45.109 --> 26:46.475
I can't stop
the bleeding!

26:46.477 --> 26:49.278
It's ok.
You're not supposed to.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.779
She's right.

26:50.781 --> 26:54.483
So can we watch the show?
Thank you.

26:56.986 --> 26:58.620
Well, they left in a hurry.

26:58.622 --> 27:00.706
Owner says they were here
less than an hour.

27:00.708 --> 27:03.075
And none of the motel
guests saw anything.

27:03.077 --> 27:04.409
Take a look
at this robbery footage.

27:04.411 --> 27:07.079
Chicago PD apologized
for the delay.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.919
Clearly not the first
time they've done this.

27:13.921 --> 27:15.120
This the only angle
we got?

27:15.122 --> 27:17.506
Cameras inside
weren't working.

27:17.508 --> 27:20.592
Muzzle flashes.

27:22.428 --> 27:23.762
And they argue.

27:23.764 --> 27:25.480
What about, though?

27:25.482 --> 27:27.316
Shooting the people inside
wasn't part of the plan.

27:27.318 --> 27:31.803
This is where
it gets good.

27:31.805 --> 27:33.238
The gun jammed.

27:39.145 --> 27:40.746
That explains
the overkill.

27:40.748 --> 27:42.480
He didn't double-cross
his partner,

27:42.482 --> 27:44.149
his partner
double-crossed him.

27:44.151 --> 27:46.201
Hey, girl. Got you
on speaker. What's up?

27:46.203 --> 27:48.820
Hey, an unidentified male was
just found shot and killed

27:48.822 --> 27:50.472
at a truck stop parking lot
outside of El Paso.

27:50.474 --> 27:51.757
Sure that's our guy?

27:51.759 --> 27:53.725
Well, a Mustang
was reported stolen

27:53.727 --> 27:56.178
less than a mile from your
current location. It's in the same lot.

27:56.180 --> 27:58.597
El Paso.
He's on the border.

27:58.599 --> 28:00.465
He wouldn't cross there,
though. It's too busy.

28:00.467 --> 28:02.834
Go back through his life again, Garcia.
He's feeling the heat,

28:02.836 --> 28:04.219
so he's gonna default
to something familiar.

28:04.221 --> 28:05.637
The answer's in there
somewhere.

28:05.639 --> 28:07.022
Done and done.

28:07.024 --> 28:08.857
Penelope.
Any word on Hotch?

28:08.859 --> 28:10.809
Still no news,
but I'm about to

28:10.811 --> 28:12.444
rouse the nurses
for some intel.

28:12.446 --> 28:13.979
You go get 'em, girl.

28:24.290 --> 28:26.908
Sam, are you ok?

28:26.910 --> 28:32.464
I just keeping seeing
that guy that you shot.

28:32.466 --> 28:35.717
He probably would have
killed me if I hadn't have done that.

28:35.719 --> 28:40.038
Then I'd be on ice and
you would be halfway home.

28:41.224 --> 28:44.426
Everything is
gonna be ok, kiddo.

28:44.428 --> 28:46.878
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.981
I promised I would
always take care of you.

28:48.983 --> 28:50.182
I meant it.

28:50.184 --> 28:53.935
I will never
leave you again.

28:53.937 --> 28:56.271
Ok.

28:59.267 --> 29:01.318
Ok.

29:01.320 --> 29:05.054
My money says this guy
caught Eddie trying to steal his car.

29:05.056 --> 29:07.056
There's a struggle,
but Eddie gets the upper hand,

29:07.058 --> 29:09.109
shoots him in the gut,
and then drags him over there.

29:09.111 --> 29:11.428
And he takes his wallet,
not because he needs money

29:11.430 --> 29:13.096
but so we can't I.D. him
as quickly.

29:13.098 --> 29:14.764
'Cause the minute we do,
we know exactly

29:14.766 --> 29:16.550
What kind of car
they're driving.

29:16.552 --> 29:18.652
Hey, break it down,
baby girl.

29:18.654 --> 29:21.838
Ok, here we go. Eddie's story is
way more tragic than we thought.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.908
We know his mom died in childbirth
and his dad committed suicide.

29:24.910 --> 29:26.593
What we didn't know
was that he's the one

29:26.595 --> 29:28.411
who found his father's
dead body.

29:28.413 --> 29:30.430
He was only 5.

29:30.432 --> 29:33.249
Yeah. The postman called the cops
when he smelled something horrible.

29:33.251 --> 29:35.602
Turns out that little
kindergarten-sized Eddie

29:35.604 --> 29:39.639
was in the house
with the corpse for two days,

29:39.641 --> 29:41.725
and it was in the middle
of a crazy heat wave, so...

29:41.727 --> 29:44.594
Wait a minute, Garcia.
Eddie's father died February 2.

29:44.596 --> 29:46.196
Uh, correctamundo.

29:46.198 --> 29:49.599
The average temperature in Chicago
in February is 26 degrees Fahrenheit.

29:49.601 --> 29:51.034
Oh, no, they weren't
in Chicago.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.737
The were in Los Angeles because
his father had a job opportunity

29:53.739 --> 29:56.790
that fell through, which he apologized
for in his suicide note

29:56.792 --> 29:58.575
that he wrote
on a stack of post cards.

29:58.577 --> 29:59.726
Are you sure they drove?

29:59.728 --> 30:01.795
Yeah. Because the post cards
were from stops

30:01.797 --> 30:02.963
they made along the way.

30:02.965 --> 30:04.965
I think I know where
they might be headed.

30:04.967 --> 30:06.583
I can't get his pressure up.

30:06.585 --> 30:08.134
It's 80 over 40.

30:08.136 --> 30:10.670
One more mg. of EPI
and we need that 0-neg.

30:10.672 --> 30:13.139
Haley, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

30:13.141 --> 30:14.140
Mm-hmm.

30:19.129 --> 30:21.431
Ohh...

30:29.975 --> 30:31.908
That was awesome.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.944
Mm.

30:33.946 --> 30:36.312
Well, it's time to go.

30:39.817 --> 30:41.818
I gotta go take a leak.

30:41.820 --> 30:43.987
I'll meet you guys
in the lobby, all right?

30:43.989 --> 30:45.672
Ok.

30:45.674 --> 30:47.791
Well, this was fun.

30:47.793 --> 30:49.759
I don't want you to go.

30:49.761 --> 30:51.661
What about Jack?

30:51.663 --> 30:53.680
And Beth? They need you now
more than ever.

30:53.682 --> 30:55.007
Just a little while longer?

30:55.008 --> 30:56.457
There's no time.
Please?

30:56.459 --> 30:59.827
You have to
go back now.

31:00.361 --> 31:02.378
I want to stay with you.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.330
I know you're
the big boss man,

31:04.332 --> 31:06.382
but you can't always
have your way, you know.

31:06.384 --> 31:09.468
Sometimes you just
have to roll with it.

31:10.671 --> 31:12.305
I don't know how.

31:12.307 --> 31:14.039
Happiness is a choice.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.891
So choose.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.145
But how?

31:19.147 --> 31:21.397
How do I choose?

31:21.399 --> 31:23.599
Get out of your head.

31:23.601 --> 31:25.234
The heart is the one
that knows,

31:25.236 --> 31:26.852
so follow it.

31:26.854 --> 31:29.271
Nice car.

31:29.273 --> 31:32.408
Hey, what gives? I thought were were
gonna meet in the lobby.

31:32.410 --> 31:34.610
Oh, anybody gonna catch
the subway downtown?

31:34.612 --> 31:36.529
I hear it's gonna be
a hot one.

31:36.531 --> 31:39.081
No?

31:39.083 --> 31:40.899
All right, then.

31:40.901 --> 31:42.952
Hey. This was great.

31:42.954 --> 31:43.953
Huh?

31:43.955 --> 31:46.038
We gotta do this again.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.207
Come here, big guy.

31:48.209 --> 31:49.842
Ahh!

31:49.844 --> 31:51.961
Take care of yourself,
all right?

31:51.963 --> 31:54.096
Jeez Louise, loosen up
a little bit.

31:54.098 --> 31:55.514
Would it kill you to smile?

31:55.516 --> 31:57.216
Seriously.

32:07.527 --> 32:09.145
Beth's a keeper.

32:09.147 --> 32:11.930
And Jack really likes her.

32:11.932 --> 32:14.233
So don't screw it up.

32:31.752 --> 32:33.786
Goodbye, Aaron.

32:33.788 --> 32:36.088
And, yes,

32:36.090 --> 32:39.425
I still love you, too.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.459
Sam.

33:45.917 --> 33:47.075
Wake up.

33:47.076 --> 33:48.267
Sam.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.291
Check it out.

33:51.384 --> 33:53.784
It looks just like it did
when my dad took me here

33:53.786 --> 33:56.003
when I was a kid.

33:56.005 --> 33:58.856
It's beautiful.

33:58.858 --> 34:01.192
♪ Ain't got a... ♪

34:01.194 --> 34:04.845
♪ And no more
old d vibes ♪

34:04.847 --> 34:06.564
Oh, no.

34:06.566 --> 34:09.100
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:12.487 --> 34:13.771
Hang on.

34:27.536 --> 34:29.820
Get out of the car, Sam.
Get out of the car.

34:29.822 --> 34:31.822
Get out of the car! Here.

34:32.842 --> 34:34.909
What are you doing?!
Stay back!

34:34.911 --> 34:36.159
Dad, you're crazy!
Get back!

34:36.161 --> 34:37.828
I'll shoot! Stay back!

34:37.830 --> 34:39.830
I'll blow her brains out!
I swear to God!

34:39.831 --> 34:41.849
Stay back!
Stop it!

34:41.851 --> 34:43.684
Go! Go! Go!

34:43.686 --> 34:45.719
I said get back!
I'll shoot!

34:45.722 --> 34:47.888
Get back or I'll shoot her!

35:02.520 --> 35:04.205
Hi, sir.

35:04.207 --> 35:05.856
Welcome back.

35:05.858 --> 35:07.658
Do you feel ok?
Do you need anything?

35:07.660 --> 35:09.493
What happened?

35:09.495 --> 35:12.463
Uh, you collapsed and they
performed emergency surgery

35:12.465 --> 35:14.081
because you were bleeding
internally.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.834
The doctor said it had something
to do with the stabbing.

35:16.836 --> 35:18.637
But you're fine.
There were some complications

35:18.638 --> 35:21.205
with the operation,
but you're--you're ok.

35:21.207 --> 35:22.840
I mean, you're like
as healthy as a puma,

35:22.842 --> 35:25.476
a bedridden puma. But my point is
you're gonna be fine.

35:25.478 --> 35:27.728
Where's Jack?

35:27.730 --> 35:29.213
He's at home with Jessica.
Shall I send for him?

35:29.215 --> 35:32.099
Please.
And I need my phone.

35:32.101 --> 35:33.884
Thank you.

35:33.886 --> 35:35.569
I need to call Beth.

35:35.571 --> 35:37.405
Ok. Uh, so I'm gonna...

35:37.407 --> 35:42.777
Call Jessica and let
the team know you're ok.

35:42.779 --> 35:43.944
Oh!
I'm sorry.

35:43.946 --> 35:45.830
It's ok.
Sir, I'm sorry.

35:45.832 --> 35:47.898
I'm just--I'm--
I'm really happy you're back.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.700
You had us worried sick.

35:49.702 --> 35:51.252
Garcia...

35:52.237 --> 35:54.321
Thank you for staying.

35:54.323 --> 35:56.406
Ohh...

35:56.408 --> 35:58.742
Wild horses, sir.

35:58.744 --> 36:02.213
Just wild horses.

36:08.437 --> 36:10.387
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

36:10.389 --> 36:11.806
I would never--
I would never hurt you.

36:11.808 --> 36:13.774
Why did you do that?

36:13.776 --> 36:16.060
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you.

36:16.062 --> 36:18.209
You said you were gonna
blow my brains out!

36:18.210 --> 36:20.371
I just needed some time
to think, baby. I just needed--

36:20.391 --> 36:22.267
I needed a little time.

36:22.268 --> 36:23.267
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

36:23.269 --> 36:26.320
Eddie Lee Wilcox,
this is the FBI.

36:26.322 --> 36:29.740
We can work this out,
but you have to let Samantha go.

36:29.742 --> 36:30.958
Come on,
she's your daughter.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.460
Do the right thing, Eddie.

36:32.462 --> 36:33.794
Has he said anything yet?

36:33.796 --> 36:34.995
Not a word.

36:34.997 --> 36:36.613
Statistically speaking,
the longer this takes

36:36.615 --> 36:38.048
the worse his daughter's
chances get.

36:38.050 --> 36:40.584
I don't know. If he was gonna
do something to her,

36:40.586 --> 36:42.086
he would have
done it by now.

36:42.088 --> 36:44.171
But now he's trapped.
The game's changed.

36:44.173 --> 36:46.924
I'm gonna try something.

36:49.144 --> 36:50.627
What are you doing, Dad?

36:50.629 --> 36:52.646
I don't know.
I don't know.

36:56.986 --> 36:58.819
Eddie?

36:58.821 --> 37:00.771
Pick up the phone, man.

37:00.773 --> 37:02.490
We only want to help you.

37:02.492 --> 37:04.191
Come on,
think about Samantha.

37:09.481 --> 37:10.480
What?

37:10.482 --> 37:11.448
Hi, Eddie?

37:11.450 --> 37:13.367
This is Agent Jareau
with the FBI.

37:13.369 --> 37:14.702
You can call me Jennifer.

37:14.704 --> 37:15.870
What do you want?

37:15.872 --> 37:16.987
Same as you.

37:16.989 --> 37:18.339
I want Samantha safe.

37:18.341 --> 37:19.924
She's fine.

37:19.926 --> 37:22.293
Can you, uh,
put her on the phone

37:22.295 --> 37:23.627
so I can hear for myself?

37:29.184 --> 37:30.301
Go ahead.

37:30.303 --> 37:31.335
Samantha?

37:31.337 --> 37:32.336
Yeah.

37:32.338 --> 37:34.772
You ok?

37:34.774 --> 37:36.273
Yeah.

37:36.275 --> 37:38.893
Is there anything
you guys need?

37:38.895 --> 37:40.144
For you to get
the hell out of here.

37:40.146 --> 37:41.896
You know I can't
do that, Eddie.

37:41.898 --> 37:44.114
But I can help get
your daughter to safety.

37:44.116 --> 37:47.117
Look, Eddie, I know
all you've ever wanted

37:47.119 --> 37:49.019
is for her to be happy
and safe.

37:49.021 --> 37:51.038
Does she look happy to you?

37:51.040 --> 37:54.074
And there's a bunch of police
out here with guns.

37:54.076 --> 37:56.860
Her safety's definitely
an issue.

37:56.862 --> 38:00.831
Eddie, I know why
you took her to the ocean.

38:00.833 --> 38:02.833
You wanted one last trip.

38:02.835 --> 38:05.719
Same as you had
with your dad.

38:05.721 --> 38:08.172
I know exactly
how you feel.

38:08.174 --> 38:11.308
And how do I feel,
Jennifer?

38:11.310 --> 38:13.928
What is she
talking about?

38:13.930 --> 38:17.431
I lost someone, too, once,

38:17.433 --> 38:19.716
the same way you did.

38:19.718 --> 38:22.770
Don't talk like you know me.
You don't know me.

38:22.772 --> 38:24.021
My sister.

38:24.023 --> 38:27.224
When I was 11, she, uh,

38:27.226 --> 38:29.893
cut her wrists with one of
my dad's razor blades.

38:29.895 --> 38:33.230
I found her in the bathtub
the next morning.

38:33.232 --> 38:34.564
Shut up!

38:34.566 --> 38:36.951
Don't make Samantha feel
the same way we did.

38:36.953 --> 38:39.236
It will change her, forever,

38:39.238 --> 38:40.788
the same way it did us.

38:40.790 --> 38:44.592
Shut up, damn it!
I said shut up, damn it!

38:44.594 --> 38:45.742
Eddie!

38:45.744 --> 38:47.378
He's not coming out.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.713
SWAT should get ready.

38:56.104 --> 38:58.389
Sam, you gotta go.

38:58.391 --> 39:00.257
What?

39:00.259 --> 39:02.943
I love you so much.

39:02.945 --> 39:04.945
More than you will ever know.

39:04.947 --> 39:06.263
Dad...

39:06.265 --> 39:08.399
You're the only good thing
I ever did.

39:08.401 --> 39:10.401
Dad, please...

39:10.403 --> 39:13.070
Oh, I'm so sorry for this.

39:13.072 --> 39:14.622
But you got your whole life.

39:14.624 --> 39:17.875
So, baby, you gotta go.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.943
What are you gonna do?

39:19.945 --> 39:22.630
He lets her go,
he either shoots himself

39:22.632 --> 39:25.615
or shoots his way out.

39:25.617 --> 39:27.584
Baby, please.

39:27.586 --> 39:29.970
You gotta go.

39:29.972 --> 39:30.971
Get out!

39:30.973 --> 39:32.272
Aah!

39:32.274 --> 39:33.974
There she is.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.658
Sam.

39:50.660 --> 39:52.642
I am not leaving.
Sam.

39:52.644 --> 39:54.028
Sam.
No, I'm not leaving.

39:54.030 --> 39:55.195
I know what
you're gonna do.

39:55.197 --> 39:57.331
And you promised
you would never leave me again.

39:57.333 --> 40:00.034
They are gonna lock me up
and throw away the key.

40:00.036 --> 40:01.702
I don't care.
At least I can--

40:01.704 --> 40:05.456
at least I can visit you
and I can write you letters.

40:05.458 --> 40:09.710
Why? All I ever do is lie
and I screw up.

40:09.712 --> 40:12.463
That is all--
that is all I ever do.

40:12.465 --> 40:13.430
No.

40:13.432 --> 40:15.466
There was no job
in Mexico.

40:15.468 --> 40:17.634
There was nothing.

40:17.636 --> 40:19.937
I'm nothing.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.272
I don't want
to leave you.

40:22.274 --> 40:24.108
I won't.

40:24.110 --> 40:26.393
So, please...

40:26.395 --> 40:28.479
Don't leave me.

40:33.985 --> 40:36.487
Look.

40:52.470 --> 40:53.804
No, no.

40:53.806 --> 40:55.139
It's ok, it's ok.
No, no!

40:55.141 --> 40:56.557
No! No! No!

40:56.559 --> 40:57.707
No, no, Dad!
It's ok. It's ok.

40:57.709 --> 40:59.927
Dad!
It's ok.

41:17.279 --> 41:19.780
Excuse me.
Sir, you have a visitor.

41:19.782 --> 41:21.031
Dad!

41:21.033 --> 41:22.950
Hey.

41:22.952 --> 41:25.119
Easy.

41:25.121 --> 41:28.255
You ok?

41:28.257 --> 41:30.407
I am now.

41:43.772 --> 41:45.639
"Life is a dream.

41:45.641 --> 41:47.241
Realize it."

41:47.243 --> 41:49.610
Mother Teresa.
