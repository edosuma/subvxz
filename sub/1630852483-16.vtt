00:03.030 --> 00:05.870
[Ok Taec-yeon]

00:08.300 --> 00:11.140
[Kim Hye-yoon]

00:14.980 --> 00:17.510
[This program includes
indirect advertisements.]

00:17.580 --> 00:19.850
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

00:19.980 --> 00:22.580
[All characters,
organizations, locations,]

00:22.650 --> 00:24.850
[and events in this drama are fictitious.]

00:25.190 --> 00:26.960
[Final episode: Mokkoji]

00:27.020 --> 00:28.920
[A gathering of people
for the purpose of a banquet or party]

00:32.659 --> 00:33.960
Once arrested,

00:34.730 --> 00:36.400
I should have been taken to
the Office of Special Justice.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.230
So explain yourself.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.800
We will get there.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.150
But before we head
to the Office of Special Justice,

00:56.990 --> 00:58.850
there is something you must do.

01:05.330 --> 01:08.330
Under your unjust tyranny,
these people you see here

01:08.400 --> 01:11.130
lost their families and friends

01:12.170 --> 01:14.740
and even their homes and land.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.570
You ought to apologize to them first.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.240
What? "Apologize"?

01:22.440 --> 01:27.320
What they want is
your sincere remorse and apology.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.590
You ignorant fool.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.490
You have no understanding
of how the world works.

01:38.030 --> 01:39.289
Did you say "remorse"?

01:40.030 --> 01:42.000
Think about it.

01:42.130 --> 01:45.930
Had I possessed any conscience,

01:46.470 --> 01:48.039
I would not have amassed such power.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.470
Stop talking nonsense
about "remorse" and such

01:52.840 --> 01:54.880
and take me
to the Office of Special Justice at once.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.850
I will pay for my crimes there.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.320
You...

02:08.960 --> 02:12.590
Do you now see why I brought you here,
not the Office of Special Justice?

02:12.890 --> 02:14.960
You brazen imbecile!

02:15.030 --> 02:16.630
Watch your language,

02:19.130 --> 02:20.970
or you could lose your head.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.510
What... What did I do so wrong?

02:25.170 --> 02:28.310
To amass power, you broke moral laws,
turned against your own family,

02:28.380 --> 02:29.840
and took innocent lives.

02:30.810 --> 02:33.880
You treated others with disdain
and mocked justice!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.380
How is that a crime?

02:37.190 --> 02:38.820
Having a desire for wealth

02:38.890 --> 02:40.490
and wishing to obtain power

02:40.560 --> 02:42.360
is only human nature.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.090
I simply did what I was able to do.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.230
You are the incompetent one
for not doing the same!

02:48.430 --> 02:51.530
Human beings do not take others' lives

02:52.570 --> 02:56.170
or betray the rules of the world

02:58.110 --> 02:59.540
just to fulfill their nature.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.210
That is only the instinct of a beast.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.710
Now,

03:06.580 --> 03:08.720
since you are no better
than a lowly beast,

03:12.350 --> 03:13.760
may I behead you?

03:15.190 --> 03:18.660
Wait, no. Listen.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.130
How about

03:22.500 --> 03:25.670
we talk it out as noblemen,
just the two of us?

03:26.329 --> 03:28.400
We belong to a class above the others,

03:28.770 --> 03:31.570
and we ought to keep face as noblemen.

03:32.470 --> 03:33.470
Right?

03:39.410 --> 03:41.220
Yes, good.

03:41.820 --> 03:44.690
Now, send away those lowborn riffraff.

03:45.450 --> 03:46.590
And the two of us

03:47.120 --> 03:50.230
can have a sensible conversation
in private, just the two of us.

03:51.590 --> 03:52.890
We can talk it out.

03:59.870 --> 04:00.900
Young Master!

04:36.740 --> 04:38.340
Will you beg for forgiveness?

04:39.710 --> 04:41.380
Or will you choose death?

04:46.880 --> 04:50.690
If I must apologize
to lowly beings like them,

04:50.890 --> 04:52.420
I would rather have you kill me.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.300
Paying for your sins with death
is simply too easy.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.810
You will live a life
that is worse than death.

05:23.350 --> 05:24.890
Take him to the Office of Special Justice!

05:24.950 --> 05:26.050
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

05:47.040 --> 05:50.480
My lord, that man deserves to die.
Why did you spare him?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.020
He is not even worth killing.

05:57.350 --> 05:59.350
I only wished he would show some remorse.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.390
He will receive the punishment
he deserves.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.390
He brought it upon himself.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.000
So what will happen to them now?

06:08.960 --> 06:11.670
Park Do-soo will be sent into exile
in a region 3,000 ri away from here,

06:11.730 --> 06:13.300
and then put under house arrest.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.770
How exactly does "house arrest" work?

06:17.770 --> 06:20.440
[A fence of thorns will be put up
around the house he lives in,]

06:20.810 --> 06:23.080
[and the main gate will remain locked
at all times.]

06:23.680 --> 06:26.510
In addition, he will not be allowed
to have contact with anyone.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.080
How many rooms does my new mansion have?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.990
Will I have servants?

06:33.050 --> 06:34.720
You are out of your mind.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.830
It is really over now.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.670
Well done, my lord.

06:45.430 --> 06:47.500
-Well done.
-You did a great job.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.540
I owe it all to you.

06:54.780 --> 06:55.740
Come on.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.909
All right, now...

07:00.080 --> 07:01.220
We can all go home.

07:01.820 --> 07:05.520
-Yes!
-We can go home!

07:07.290 --> 07:08.520
Let us go home!

07:10.060 --> 07:11.790
[Park Seung will be removed from office]

07:11.860 --> 07:13.490
[and boiled to death.]

07:13.560 --> 07:14.830
["Boiled"? How do you mean?]

07:15.130 --> 07:18.300
[We pretend to boil a criminal alive
in a cauldron.]

07:18.370 --> 07:19.970
[Then once he is taken out
of the cauldron,]

07:20.030 --> 07:22.470
[he is to be treated like the dead
even though he is alive.]

07:27.140 --> 07:29.010
[Ghost]

07:29.340 --> 07:31.080
Wait.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.480
What do I do if I need to relieve myself?

07:33.550 --> 07:36.780
How dare a ghost speak?
Must I teach you a lesson?

07:38.450 --> 07:40.250
Here, you can use this chamber pot.

07:47.430 --> 07:50.159
Do you remember me?

07:57.870 --> 07:59.070
You are...

08:00.980 --> 08:03.340
You are Tae-seo's mother who ran away.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.650
So you do remember me.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.880
You ran away from home.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.950
You should have died
and vanished for good.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.750
How dare you return alive
and show your face?

08:14.260 --> 08:17.090
You shameless, lowly wench.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.860
This lowly wench gave birth to Do-soo.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.770
Do-soo has three red spots on his back,
does he not?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.370
How do you know

08:30.140 --> 08:33.169
about the red spots on my son's back?

08:33.770 --> 08:35.210
Because he is my son.

08:35.610 --> 08:38.080
I did not want my child
to be treated with disdain all his life,

08:38.350 --> 08:40.620
so I swapped the two babies.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.450
What on earth

08:43.720 --> 08:45.650
are you saying now?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.820
Tae-seo is your legitimate son,

08:47.890 --> 08:49.320
not Do-soo!

08:51.160 --> 08:54.560
You used him as a pawn.
Then when he was no longer of use to you,

08:55.130 --> 08:58.030
you ruthlessly took his life.
That boy, Tae-seo,

08:58.870 --> 09:01.170
is your legitimate son!

09:00.940 --> 09:04.210
[Ghost]

09:10.710 --> 09:13.710
My whole life, I waited for this day.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.490
I will pay for what I did with Do-soo.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.020
You can

09:19.920 --> 09:23.020
suffer for the rest of your life

09:23.290 --> 09:25.490
and slowly die in pain.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.000
You... Darn you!

09:37.540 --> 09:38.940
[Father...]

09:44.310 --> 09:45.510
Let us go.

09:47.550 --> 09:48.520
No...

09:48.650 --> 09:50.020
Wait and see.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.620
You will face your demise very soon
anyway.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.120
And as you breathe your last,

09:56.790 --> 09:59.690
you will think of this day
and weep with deep regret.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.000
No...

10:03.200 --> 10:06.530
Do-soo... I mean, Tae-seo.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.570
No...

10:12.110 --> 10:15.010
No, this cannot be...

10:17.910 --> 10:19.850
Tae-seo!

10:29.260 --> 10:32.160
♫ Ten out of ten ♫

10:32.230 --> 10:36.730
♫ Again and again ♫

10:39.030 --> 10:40.030
My lord.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.640
Why... What is the matter?

10:46.170 --> 10:48.610
-I...
-What is it?

10:53.550 --> 10:55.820
I have resigned!

10:58.390 --> 11:01.290
Our lord is finally deadbeat!

11:01.390 --> 11:04.290
-Dreams come true!
-Yes, it does!

11:04.560 --> 11:07.700
From today onwards,
I will laze around at home

11:08.430 --> 11:09.560
-and live an idle life!
-That is it!

11:09.630 --> 11:11.300
-An idle life!
-An idle life!

11:11.370 --> 11:14.300
-Loaf around, eat, and sleep!
-I love it!

11:14.400 --> 11:16.270
-Awesome!
-Yes!

11:16.740 --> 11:18.970
-Loaf around, eat, and sleep!
-Congratulations, my lord!

11:19.170 --> 11:21.540
Yes, I am now a moocher!

11:21.910 --> 11:24.710
-Oh, yes!
-Hurray!

11:24.780 --> 11:26.810
Yippee!

11:30.820 --> 11:31.890
Have we packed everything?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.220
Yes, we will sell the rest at the market.

11:41.730 --> 11:43.900
Gwang-soon, Bi-ryeong.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.130
If you are leaving because of me,

11:46.230 --> 11:49.470
you do not have to.
I will come to visit you two at Hanyang.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.040
What are you talking about?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.770
I am excited to see
my older brother and siblings.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
There is nothing good
about Hanyang to me either.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.580
I am here because of you two,

11:58.650 --> 12:00.780
and I would not be if I were alone.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.190
It is a shame
we have to bid farewell to this house,

12:05.650 --> 12:08.090
but going to Ganghwa Island together
makes me happy.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.130
-We were going to go anyway.
-Totally.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.960
Thanks, and I really mean it.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.330
-Do not mention it.
-Goodness.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.070
Once we are there, I will continue
to be a seamstress,

12:22.140 --> 12:23.640
and Bi-ryeong will tell fortunes.

12:23.770 --> 12:24.740
What about you, Gwang-soon?

12:24.810 --> 12:27.010
I am thinking of running
a medicinal store.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.380
A medicinal store!

12:29.540 --> 12:32.110
I heard many kids cannot get medicine

12:32.180 --> 12:33.850
even when they are sick.

12:33.910 --> 12:35.150
I heard that too.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.750
Having learned things from my father,

12:37.820 --> 12:40.050
I can differentiate herbs
and know what they are used for.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.020
So running a medicinal store might help.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.230
-That is a great idea.
-Is it?

12:46.630 --> 12:48.360
But it will cost us quite a fortune

12:48.500 --> 12:50.730
to run a seamstress shop,
fortune-telling shop,

12:50.970 --> 12:53.200
and a medicinal shop.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.540
It will, but we worked
our buttocks off, did we not?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.810
-Until now, we have--
-Listen.

12:57.940 --> 12:58.970
What is it?

12:59.170 --> 13:03.810
Actually, Lord Yi-eon and I
talked about that.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.980
What are we doing next?

13:09.480 --> 13:10.950
I will open a dumpling diner.

13:11.820 --> 13:12.720
What?

13:12.790 --> 13:15.860
You know very well
the dumplings I make are the best

13:15.920 --> 13:17.160
in the whole of Joseon.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.960
Have you finally snapped?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.830
How can a noble run a dumpling diner?

13:21.930 --> 13:25.170
Yes, you have resigned,
but running a shop is a menial job.

13:25.370 --> 13:28.940
If badly caught,
the whole family will turn upside down--

13:29.000 --> 13:31.370
And generations after the next
cannot take the civil service exam.

13:31.470 --> 13:32.540
I know.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.580
But my all-time dream
is to become Joseon's finest head chef.

13:37.010 --> 13:40.710
It took a lot to resign,
so let me do this for once.

13:40.950 --> 13:45.120
Here is the thing. Unless a noble throws
away his title and becomes a commoner,

13:45.920 --> 13:48.160
they cannot run a business.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.690
You do not want to climb the career ladder
or get married.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.990
But you are willing
to become a commoner to run a business.

13:53.260 --> 13:56.460
Young Master, you know very well
how upset Big Madam will be,

13:56.530 --> 13:57.730
do you not?

13:59.100 --> 14:00.330
I am of low class,

14:01.300 --> 14:03.600
so I cannot marry Gwang-soon
even if I want to.

14:03.970 --> 14:06.910
So stop saying you want to throw away
that great noble class.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.310
Why can you not get married?

14:09.610 --> 14:12.350
Gwang-soon is a daughter of a doctor,
so that puts her in the middle class.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.950
She will become a low class
if we get married.

14:17.050 --> 14:19.520
No matter how much I love Gwang-soon,

14:19.990 --> 14:22.320
I cannot drag her down to the low class.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.060
There are people like us, my lord.

14:26.830 --> 14:30.560
So please do not say
you will run a shop and such.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.300
Then what about this?

14:36.570 --> 14:38.740
I will buy a small land in Ganghwa Island

14:39.210 --> 14:41.480
for all of us to run a business.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.310
We can do whatever we want,
from a seamstress shop,

14:44.380 --> 14:46.750
a fortune-telling shop,
to a medicinal shop.

14:46.950 --> 14:50.320
But he wants a part of it
to be a dumpling diner.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.690
-A dumpling diner?
-A dumpling diner?

14:52.490 --> 14:55.220
He wants to open one
with Yuk-chil and Goo-pal.

14:55.820 --> 14:59.790
Does that mean Yuk-chil and Goo-pal
will also come with us?

14:59.860 --> 15:02.130
By all of us...

15:02.900 --> 15:05.600
Does it include Gwang-soon?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.170
Then count me in.

15:11.570 --> 15:12.810
Was it not a crazy idea?

15:12.870 --> 15:15.410
I said running a shop was

15:15.640 --> 15:17.440
not going to Ganghwa Island.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.880
It would be reassuring to go together.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.180
I will provide the capital.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.450
We will run the business.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.690
And the profit earned
will be divided equally.

15:26.490 --> 15:27.420
How about it?

15:27.490 --> 15:29.590
It is not a bum deal.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.230
I am up for it.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.660
Well, it is not a bad idea.

15:34.090 --> 15:37.060
But what will you tell Big Madam?

15:37.230 --> 15:41.270
I told her we were going to Ganghwa Island
for a short break.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.770
And she gave us permission to do so.

15:45.410 --> 15:46.570
But Young Master,

15:47.210 --> 15:50.310
you cannot
run the business yourself, okay?

15:50.380 --> 15:53.080
If it is under the condition
you will not run it yourself,

15:54.320 --> 15:56.020
I am in on it too for now.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.550
All right, I got it, so dig in.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.120
-You eat first.
[-Awesome!]

16:01.190 --> 16:02.220
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

16:02.890 --> 16:04.160
So what are we doing again?

16:04.260 --> 16:05.760
A seamstress shop, a fortune-telling shop,

16:05.830 --> 16:07.460
-a medicinal shop...
-And a dumpling diner!

16:10.200 --> 16:11.370
How cool!

16:26.550 --> 16:29.420
This here will be our new place.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.250
-It is amazing.
-Thank you.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.550
Thank you.

16:33.650 --> 16:35.920
May I open a dumpling diner in the middle?

16:35.990 --> 16:37.960
-Of course.
-Yes, you may.

16:39.730 --> 16:43.230
Then I will run a seamstress shop
in that room.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.700
Browsing through the seamstress shop
after some dumplings sounds good.

16:47.370 --> 16:50.200
Fortune telling should be done in private,
so I will take the room at the end.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.840
Then I will open my medicinal shop
near the entrance.

16:53.910 --> 16:56.610
So the customers
have easy access to medicines.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.210
Great. Our house is over there,

16:59.410 --> 17:00.910
so let us move our luggage

17:00.980 --> 17:02.080
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.119
Lady Jo-yi, give it to me.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.550
Why would you call me lady?

17:05.849 --> 17:07.490
Just call me by my name.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.819
No can do, Lady Jo-yi.

17:09.890 --> 17:12.630
Since you have that
kind of relationship with our lord.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.200
That does not make a difference.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.900
I prefer you call me by my name.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.700
But...

17:20.329 --> 17:21.839
Do as she wants.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.339
Fine then.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.470
Let us go, Jo-yi.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.710
That reminds me,
have you hired a head chef?

17:32.110 --> 17:34.680
Do not worry as I have found
Joseon's best chef.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
I will call him over as soon as
the preparations are done.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.250
Let us go.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.290
[Let us decide on the signboard first.]

17:41.390 --> 17:42.760
What should it be named?

17:47.960 --> 17:49.500
How are things going?

17:49.560 --> 17:51.770
-Do not look, my lord.
-Gosh.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.930
-I was not going to.
-"I was not going to."

17:56.070 --> 17:59.110
Now then, we will reveal
the signboards we made.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.010
-Here it is!
-Here it is!

This is my masterpiece, "Mandubang."

18:08.450 --> 18:09.550
Mandubang.

18:09.950 --> 18:12.550
It is a place run by all of us,

18:12.690 --> 18:15.420
so how can you name it that?

18:15.760 --> 18:18.660
That is because the dumpling diner
is in the center of all.

18:18.930 --> 18:22.060
And what are all these childish drawings?

18:22.200 --> 18:25.230
Our dumpling diner is high-end.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.370
But if you write it in Chinese characters,

18:27.470 --> 18:30.700
how will customers
who do not know how to read visit us?

18:30.770 --> 18:32.070
-She is right.
-That is true.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.310
You are right. My lord, Jo-yi is on point.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.110
To emphasize
that we have gathered together,

18:38.010 --> 18:41.520
[Mokkoji]

18:39.080 --> 18:41.350
I wrote "Mokkoji."

18:42.750 --> 18:43.850
I like it.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.150
-That is nice.
-I agree.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.090
But how will customers know what we sell?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.530
Then how about hanging this in the middle

18:53.660 --> 18:56.160
and the others in each room?

18:56.360 --> 18:58.500
With that, they will know what we sell,

18:58.630 --> 19:01.400
and it will become a signboard
made by all of us.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.970
-This is it.
-That is a great idea.

19:04.340 --> 19:05.640
I like it.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.680
Fine. Then I will hang this

19:08.780 --> 19:11.380
along with Yuk-chil's and Goo-pal's.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.750
-Oh, my gosh.
-"Mokkoji".

19:13.980 --> 19:15.850
Hey, you wrote
in Chinese characters as well!

19:15.950 --> 19:17.080
We will sell.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.990
-This looks nice.
-This is amazing.

19:20.590 --> 19:23.990
Bi-ryeong, how about a game
after we quickly clean everything up?

19:24.830 --> 19:28.100
-No, thanks.
-We have loads to do, so wake up.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.060
-Move.
-Goo-pal, how about a game?

19:30.130 --> 19:31.830
Sure.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.100
Stop.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.040
I put those tables over there on purpose.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.840
So why are you moving them?

19:39.940 --> 19:42.710
Do not have these stacked
in front of my shop.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.910
It will get in the way
of the customers coming in.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.850
Get in their way?

19:46.910 --> 19:50.850
I placed it here, so they can look
at your shop while having some dumplings.

19:50.950 --> 19:53.250
But say that a customer sits here.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.890
They will block everyone else's view.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.660
Nonsense! Look.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.860
One could eat dumplings here

19:58.930 --> 20:01.360
and then see
that we offer a seamstress service.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.530
What do you mean
those are blocking its view?

20:03.600 --> 20:04.930
You being tall is the problem.

one must rest for two days.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.000
Only then will we regain our energy.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.130
I see.

28:26.170 --> 28:29.900
I have never thought of having days off

28:30.340 --> 28:32.510
and the idea of it seems like a sin.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.180
How can it be a sin
when you earned it through hard work?

28:37.940 --> 28:40.580
Together, we built this place
from the ground up.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.390
Jo-yi, do whatever you wish to do.

28:50.590 --> 28:53.730
So tell me.
What would you like to do on the weekend?

28:57.430 --> 28:58.500
Then...

29:05.870 --> 29:08.440
Everyone should get together
and play games!

29:12.880 --> 29:14.610
-Everyone?
-Yes.

29:14.810 --> 29:17.080
Even the ladies and children
of Tail Island

29:17.150 --> 29:19.020
will join us for some games.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.890
-Every one of them?
-Yes.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.730
Sounds good.

29:27.090 --> 29:30.000
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

29:30.060 --> 29:31.500
Has the Chinese trumpet vine blossomed?

29:31.560 --> 29:33.200
Where? Do you see it?

29:33.270 --> 29:34.330
-Do you see it?
-I do not.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.570
I do not mean
that they have actually blossomed.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.210
It is the name of the game.

29:40.110 --> 29:42.280
Oh, I see.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.040
What a peculiar name.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.680
It is one we all enjoyed
in our childhood years.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.480
Was that not the case with you?

29:48.580 --> 29:50.050
During my childhood years,

29:50.120 --> 29:53.120
I was busy taking classes
and learning how to read and write.

29:53.190 --> 29:56.290
Then the game will begin!

29:56.420 --> 29:58.060
Okay. Let us play.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.960
The team that loses gets a penalty.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.600
Since we are taller than you,

30:04.660 --> 30:06.670
we shall start three steps behind.

30:07.030 --> 30:10.600
You play with your heart,
not with your height.

30:10.670 --> 30:12.640
Also, you must be quick-witted and speedy.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.270
And you need sharp discernment as well.

30:14.910 --> 30:17.340
Wit, speed, and sharp discernment.
That is me.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.580
However, I forbid you from getting hurt.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.320
That is an order.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.490
-Whatever!
-Whatever!

30:30.060 --> 30:33.960
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

30:37.760 --> 30:38.800
What are you doing?

30:38.870 --> 30:40.230
I apologize, my lord.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.270
You are out. Go stand behind the line.

30:47.310 --> 30:48.910
-I am sorry.
-You are out, you idiot.

30:49.410 --> 30:52.250
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

30:53.750 --> 30:56.250
-My, I see the flowers!
-You are out. Go, behind the line.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.120
Go! I am busy.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.720
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

31:01.990 --> 31:03.960
-I saw you. You are out.
-I told you not to get hurt.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.130
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

31:24.540 --> 31:27.010
Out. You too, out. Go stand in the back.

31:27.350 --> 31:30.320
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

31:34.550 --> 31:37.360
♫ Chinese trumpet vine has blossomed ♫

31:46.170 --> 31:47.330
We won!

31:47.870 --> 31:51.170
You talked about height and all,
but you did nothing.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.770
She rang her bells in my ear.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.810
-Go away.
-When? I did not.

31:54.870 --> 31:56.010
Is this how it is played?

31:56.210 --> 31:58.310
Yes. And you lost, my lord.

31:59.410 --> 32:02.220
Since you lost, you must pay the penalty.

32:02.780 --> 32:04.750
Fine. What is the penalty?

32:05.720 --> 32:09.190
Go to the cemetery on the hill
in the middle of the night,

32:09.260 --> 32:10.960
put up a flag, and return in one piece.

32:11.930 --> 32:12.990
But...

32:20.130 --> 32:22.270
You could not even say a word
when Jo-yi suggested this.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.200
And look at us. What are we doing here?

32:29.980 --> 32:32.180
-Get up.
-You are one to talk.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.720
You got me eliminated too
while trying to help Gwang-soon.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.120
Why did you have to give in?

32:38.180 --> 32:39.290
Will you be quiet?

32:39.520 --> 32:41.350
We must find the graves first.

32:41.450 --> 32:44.260
Goodness gracious. Our Young Master
acted like he knew where to go,

32:44.320 --> 32:45.860
but he got lost again, Goo-pal.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.460
He always gets lost.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.570
-My gosh!
-What? What is it? Seriously!

32:52.800 --> 32:54.100
I think I found the way.

32:57.070 --> 32:58.140
Maybe not.

32:59.740 --> 33:00.910
Is that not a path?

33:01.910 --> 33:04.780
Oh, yes! It must be this way.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.310
-Maybe not?
-I doubt...

33:20.030 --> 33:21.160
My elbow!

33:29.840 --> 33:31.070
-Found it!
-Just like that?

33:31.170 --> 33:32.140
-Where?
-Over there.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.340
Where is it?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.680
Where are the graves?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.150
Right there. Go and check.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.450
-I do not see anything.
-Go and check it out! Go!

33:46.050 --> 33:48.960
I am so scared. Hang on.

33:49.020 --> 33:50.460
I am so scared!

33:50.890 --> 33:52.060
I am terrified!

34:07.440 --> 34:08.540
Yuk-chil.

34:09.239 --> 34:12.050
Hey, Gwang-soon.

34:12.409 --> 34:13.580
What are you doing here?

34:14.179 --> 34:15.380
Oh, well...

34:16.150 --> 34:19.290
I was waiting for someone here.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.120
Who?

34:23.060 --> 34:26.889
Who are you waiting for at this late hour,
all dressed up like that?

34:26.960 --> 34:28.800
Who could it be?

34:29.630 --> 34:30.699
Well...

34:34.570 --> 34:36.540
-A man.
-A man?

34:38.909 --> 34:40.110
Who is that man?

34:41.070 --> 34:42.280
Why can you not say?

34:42.710 --> 34:43.780
Are you stupid?

34:43.940 --> 34:45.909
Why can you not say who that man is

34:45.980 --> 34:47.210
and that he is yours?

34:47.280 --> 34:48.310
You.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.620
I was waiting for you, Yuk-chil.

34:58.060 --> 35:01.260
A cemetery in the middle of the night?
That is too harsh.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.200
Come with me.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.370
Well... The truth is,

35:10.070 --> 35:12.640
Gwang-soon wishes to marry Yuk-chil,

35:13.210 --> 35:15.780
but he will not propose to her.

35:17.410 --> 35:18.480
Well,

35:19.480 --> 35:21.510
he actually wants to but cannot

35:21.680 --> 35:23.050
because of his lowly status.

35:23.150 --> 35:24.220
I know.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.490
And so does Gwang-soon.

35:28.050 --> 35:29.420
But Gwang-soon said

35:29.520 --> 35:32.860
she does not care because
she even lived in hiding as a slave.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.900
The problem is that
Yuk-chil will not even bring it up.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.600
So that is how she feels.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.300
I plan to use the penalty as an excuse

35:44.370 --> 35:46.540
to get them to meet
in front of the shrine.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.880
So you wish to arrange their seubcheob?

35:49.010 --> 35:52.180
Correct. This way, he will not have to
worry about social pressure.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.950
Gwang-soon came up with the idea.

35:56.150 --> 35:59.150
Then I shall share the plan with Goo-pal

35:59.520 --> 36:02.720
so that we can take Yuk-chil to the shrine
using the penalty as an excuse.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.690
I will also be there
with Bi-ryeong and Gwang-soon.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.390
Good.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.870
Is this...

36:20.470 --> 36:24.340
I stood here, hoping you would be
the first man to walk by.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.420
Marry me.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.980
All of us here are your witnesses.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.850
You know that
you must take her as your wife, right?

37:03.150 --> 37:05.380
The Spirit says
you two will live happily ever after.

37:05.450 --> 37:09.220
For the first time in two decades,
I will finally get a room to myself.

37:10.890 --> 37:14.030
It looks like we have to share a room now.

37:15.630 --> 37:16.930
I already packed my things.

37:17.660 --> 37:18.730
Hold on.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.770
Lord Yi-eon and Jo-yi.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.800
Are you not a seubcheob couple too?

37:26.810 --> 37:29.410
You know, you said
you had to accept her as your wife

37:29.480 --> 37:31.880
because it is a serious crime
to violate moral principles.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.690
Rain.

37:41.750 --> 37:42.890
-What?
-What?

37:42.990 --> 37:45.160
Do you not think it will rain soon?

37:45.220 --> 37:46.990
We should descend now.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.060
-All I see is the bright full moon.
-No.

37:49.130 --> 37:51.200
-It will start pouring suddenly.
-Before you drag us off...

37:51.260 --> 37:52.300
Let us go, baby.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.700
No, we have to go.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.100
I do not want my baby to get soaked.

37:55.670 --> 37:56.900
Me neither.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.240
Wait up!

38:03.840 --> 38:05.040
Wait up.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.020
We might hear some good news today.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.360
The magpies are singing.

38:19.890 --> 38:22.060
We might get a special visitor.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.510
Here. What does this say?

38:39.810 --> 38:42.210
[Your status shall be canceled.]

38:44.520 --> 38:45.580
Hey, this is...

38:47.050 --> 38:49.560
This is an official letter
that cancels our status.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.490
What?

38:53.090 --> 38:55.630
Are you saying I am no longer a slave?

38:56.460 --> 38:57.500
Correct.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.370
Hey! Yuk-chil!

39:01.030 --> 39:02.070
Here.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.270
It is from Lord Yi-eon.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.710
He did not want to interrupt
your first night together.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.940
He says it is your wedding gift.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.980
Thanks to you, even I have been cleared
of my slave status.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.390
-Is that true?
-Yes. Look.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.520
Okay, then this means...

39:25.260 --> 39:28.260
This means we and our children

39:28.330 --> 39:30.360
can live freely as commoners.

39:36.070 --> 39:37.540
Thank you, my lord.

39:40.570 --> 39:41.870
Thank you, Lord Yi-eon.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.040
Yuk-chil.

39:45.980 --> 39:49.550
Yuk-chil! Well done.

39:50.380 --> 39:53.320
-Gwang-soon.
-You have been through so much.

39:54.290 --> 39:55.590
-Hey, calm down.
-Gwang-soon.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.590
Congratulations. It is great news.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.760
-Gwang-soon.
- Yes?

40:00.860 --> 40:01.890
Gwang-soon.

40:02.860 --> 40:03.830
That's enough.

40:03.930 --> 40:05.260
-Hold on.
-Oh, gosh.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.940
-I will do it.
-No, I will.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.600
[Medicine]

40:12.570 --> 40:13.770
Did you have it alone?

40:14.610 --> 40:15.780
Did not.

40:21.910 --> 40:23.780
It is quite tiresome, is it not?

40:24.750 --> 40:26.350
Why? Are you jealous?

40:27.690 --> 40:29.590
I am not.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.490
Honestly, I am a better looker
than Yuk-chil.

40:33.230 --> 40:34.830
But where is the love of my life?

40:34.990 --> 40:38.930
You see, everyone has a destined partner.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.230
And you will meet her when the time comes.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.740
When will that be? In my next life?

40:46.670 --> 40:49.010
How about we ask Bi-ryeong?

40:50.610 --> 40:51.680
Bi-ryeong!

40:51.740 --> 40:53.980
Hey, Jo-yi. What is it?

40:56.480 --> 40:57.850
-Listen.
-Yes?

40:57.920 --> 41:00.050
Do you mind reading Goo-pal's fortune?

41:00.120 --> 41:03.020
Sure. What would you like to know?

41:03.090 --> 41:05.190
It is not necessarily something
I want to know.

41:05.260 --> 41:08.290
But both Lord Yi-eon and Yuk-chil

41:08.360 --> 41:10.760
met their beloved.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.130
But I have not.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.000
I see.

41:15.070 --> 41:18.100
So I was wondering if you shake these,

41:18.400 --> 41:21.740
will you be able to tell
when I will meet mine?

41:22.040 --> 41:23.240
-That is what it was.
-Yes.

41:24.540 --> 41:26.050
Let me see.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.450
Let me see. Come on, let me see.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.560
How strange.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.030
Mal-jong is unable to forget Pal-soon.

41:49.000 --> 41:49.970
What?

41:54.570 --> 41:57.480
You must know you are a cutie.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.910
I was serious about you,

42:03.020 --> 42:04.320
Pal-soon.

42:09.290 --> 42:13.030
You mean Cha Mal-jong?

42:13.090 --> 42:16.500
Mal-jong is not letting Pal-soon go,
so it will not be easy.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.400
Goodness, what a pity.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.900
Why did you have her read my fortune?

42:21.970 --> 42:24.400
[-Goo-pal!]
-Yes?

42:25.240 --> 42:28.040
-Just why!
-I am sorry.

42:31.610 --> 42:33.150
I feel bad for him.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.480
Maybe it was better not to ask.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.550
Jo-yi!

42:40.490 --> 42:41.520
Yes?

42:43.820 --> 42:45.590
Jo-yi, it is me, Bo-ri.

42:54.470 --> 42:56.370
I missed you, so I came by.

42:59.970 --> 43:01.170
Are you really Bo-ri?

43:01.240 --> 43:03.440
Yes, it is me, Bo-ri.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.480
Gosh, you cannot imagine how happy I am
to see you healthy and well.

43:15.690 --> 43:16.720
How about you?

43:17.490 --> 43:19.190
How is your life in the other world?

43:19.460 --> 43:23.030
Great, I met my baby and my mother.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.300
I was able to reunite with my baby
because you did not forget

43:27.370 --> 43:29.170
my baby's clothes.

43:32.270 --> 43:33.770
I see.

43:35.370 --> 43:36.540
That is a relief.

43:36.610 --> 43:40.150
So live your life to the fullest,

43:40.710 --> 43:44.420
and let us meet again later, much later.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.790
Okay.

43:51.390 --> 43:54.930
Gosh, my baby is looking for me.

43:55.190 --> 43:56.430
Must you leave?

43:57.030 --> 43:58.900
Can you not stay a little longer?

44:00.600 --> 44:02.430
You will realize once you become a mother.

44:04.170 --> 44:06.070
I am off, Jo-yi.

44:09.410 --> 44:10.610
Goodness.

44:11.610 --> 44:14.280
Smile so that I can leave at ease.

44:14.980 --> 44:15.980
Come on.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.190
Okay.

44:23.090 --> 44:24.890
Hurry up and go.

44:25.490 --> 44:26.760
Bye.

44:49.950 --> 44:52.450
What? Jo-yi!

44:52.820 --> 44:55.290
Goo-pal will meet his beloved one day,
so do not worry too much.

44:58.660 --> 44:59.790
Bi-ryeong.

45:00.430 --> 45:01.460
What...

45:05.200 --> 45:08.200
Gosh, what is wrong?

45:21.280 --> 45:23.220
-Have you heard?
-What?

45:23.280 --> 45:25.420
I was in Hanyang not too long ago,

45:25.480 --> 45:27.650
and the people told me

45:27.790 --> 45:30.220
the king is not doing so well.

45:30.290 --> 45:31.660
That I have heard too.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.360
He would not stop devouring injeolmi
and in the end,

45:34.860 --> 45:36.560
he caught the unquenchable thirst disease.

45:36.630 --> 45:38.100
Oh, my.

45:51.940 --> 45:54.550
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

45:54.780 --> 45:57.520
-Goodness, call the doctor!
-What is wrong, Your Majesty?

45:57.580 --> 45:58.680
Then...

45:59.620 --> 46:01.790
will we become better-off?

46:01.850 --> 46:04.060
Gosh, stop spouting nonsense.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.890
Just hurry up and dig in.

46:05.960 --> 46:08.190
We are at the worst,
so of course, it should get better.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.000
I cannot agree more.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.600
You are right.

46:11.660 --> 46:13.430
Excuse me, more seokbakji, please!

46:13.500 --> 46:15.130
Just a moment, please.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.070
Goodness, we are out of seokbakji,

46:18.140 --> 46:20.470
so as an apology,
here are some dumplings I made,

46:20.540 --> 46:21.610
the so-called on-the-house dumplings.

46:21.710 --> 46:23.910
-Oh, my.
-You did not have to.

46:23.980 --> 46:26.250
-Thank you!
-No problem.

46:26.310 --> 46:27.550
We will come again.

46:27.750 --> 46:30.980
-Hello, madams. Welcome.
-Welcome

46:33.550 --> 46:35.590
Are you not Yuk-chil?

46:37.160 --> 46:38.790
Goo-pal?

46:40.890 --> 46:43.200
Why are you two...

46:45.300 --> 46:46.600
-Well...
-You see...

46:54.340 --> 46:55.440
That lad...

46:57.740 --> 46:59.280
Is that not Yi-eon?

46:59.340 --> 47:01.680
Oh, my, Madam.

47:01.910 --> 47:04.320
Why would Young Master
be wearing clothes like those?

47:04.980 --> 47:06.020
Then who is he?

47:06.650 --> 47:08.790
You heard how great this place is,
did you not, Madam?

47:08.850 --> 47:11.520
We are here to have a taste
of the dumplings too.

47:11.590 --> 47:12.660
That is right.

47:12.720 --> 47:15.260
But he looks a lot like Yi-eon.

47:15.460 --> 47:19.100
That tall lad over there. Is it not him?

47:19.160 --> 47:22.000
-Come on.
-No way. Why would he be there?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.270
-You are right.
-Yes, we are.

47:24.970 --> 47:27.240
There is no way Yi-eon would be here.

47:28.310 --> 47:31.240
Then where is he?

47:31.310 --> 47:33.710
He went to the bathroom.
He will not take long.

47:33.780 --> 47:35.510
Please take a seat over there.

47:35.580 --> 47:36.680
Sure.

47:38.150 --> 47:40.290
I cannot believe Grandmother came.

47:40.350 --> 47:41.790
What do I do?

47:42.390 --> 47:44.760
-My clothes!
-Here you go.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.930
-Your hat!
-Right, my hat!

47:46.990 --> 47:48.590
Wait, slow down.

47:48.660 --> 47:50.800
Are you not being too hasty?

47:55.330 --> 47:56.900
-Right, quickly.
-You are done.

47:58.870 --> 48:00.440
What would you like to order?

48:02.810 --> 48:05.840
I mean, what should we order?

48:09.550 --> 48:11.420
Cabbage dumplings...

48:12.180 --> 48:13.550
and fish dumplings.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.790
Order everything on the menu.

48:16.860 --> 48:19.090
-Understood.
-An order of everything, please!

48:19.160 --> 48:20.590
Bring us everything you have!

48:20.660 --> 48:21.830
How nice of them.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.730
Oh, Grandmother.

48:26.870 --> 48:28.030
When did you arrive?

48:28.100 --> 48:30.240
Why did you not drop by the house first?

48:30.370 --> 48:32.840
You love dumplings, so I thought
we might bump into each other here,

48:32.910 --> 48:34.640
and we really did.

48:35.570 --> 48:37.710
It is near our house,

48:37.780 --> 48:39.180
so we come by often.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.280
Near?

48:42.510 --> 48:43.580
Does that mean

48:44.220 --> 48:47.090
that girl named Jo-yi is staying with...

49:08.340 --> 49:09.440
Follow me inside.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.430
You are not the only one
I wanted to speak to.

49:26.990 --> 49:28.530
Let me be the first one you talk to.

49:28.690 --> 49:30.960
The way she does her hair tells me

49:31.030 --> 49:32.760
that you are not married.

49:33.700 --> 49:36.640
We are doing well together.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.270
Exactly!

49:38.640 --> 49:42.110
Why are you two not married
when you live together?

49:42.710 --> 49:45.640
Who does that darn midget think she is?

49:45.810 --> 49:48.950
You should give her some time to think.

49:53.750 --> 49:56.190
[Well, rather than him
being out and about]

49:56.250 --> 49:58.160
[as a secret royal inspector,]

49:58.260 --> 50:00.960
[I do find peace knowing
that they are building a life together.]

50:02.090 --> 50:03.330
So tell me.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.900
Do you sleep alone in this room?

50:08.330 --> 50:10.540
-Yes.
-Then where does Jo-yi sleep?

50:10.970 --> 50:13.940
The women stay together
in a room of their own.

50:14.070 --> 50:16.440
You darn fool!

50:16.980 --> 50:18.010
Pardon?

50:19.680 --> 50:20.780
The tea is hot, Grandmother.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.980
[If they start sleeping together,]

50:25.050 --> 50:27.520
[the girl will bear a child
sooner or later.]

50:27.620 --> 50:30.360
[Then they will have no choice
but to get married.]

50:33.990 --> 50:37.360
Know that I will be
staying here for a few days.

50:38.430 --> 50:39.300
Pardon?

50:39.360 --> 50:40.970
This is where I will sleep,

50:41.300 --> 50:43.670
so find a room for yourself
somewhere else.

50:45.100 --> 50:46.170
But Grandmother...

51:00.690 --> 51:01.950
What do I do?

51:03.620 --> 51:04.920
Yuk-chil...

51:05.720 --> 51:07.930
No, Gwang-soon is with him now.

51:08.630 --> 51:11.300
Of course. I almost forgot.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.270
There is a vacant room.

51:22.170 --> 51:23.210
Whatever.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.930
I guess I will have to sleep
in Goo-pal's room.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.190
Hey, Goo-pal.

51:42.990 --> 51:44.330
Why are you not in bed?

51:44.600 --> 51:46.700
-Were you relieving yourself?
-Yes, my lord.

51:47.670 --> 51:48.700
I am afraid

51:49.870 --> 51:51.700
I have to put you out tonight.

51:53.070 --> 51:54.870
-No way.
-Goo-pal!

51:55.940 --> 51:57.580
My grandmother is here.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.110
I have never had a room of my own
throughout the 20 years of my life.

52:02.050 --> 52:03.220
Unbelievable.

52:04.250 --> 52:06.720
But Goo-pal!

52:09.350 --> 52:10.390
Goo-pal?

52:29.740 --> 52:30.840
Jo-yi.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.380
Are you asleep?

52:36.620 --> 52:39.380
Jo-yi, are you asleep?

53:00.810 --> 53:01.970
Do not worry.

53:03.740 --> 53:04.840
I will never...

53:07.880 --> 53:10.450
cross over this pillow.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.420
Whatever.

53:19.720 --> 53:23.090
I am exhausted and would like to turn in.

53:36.710 --> 53:40.380
You are not actually asleep, are you?

53:46.750 --> 53:51.120
How can you sleep when I am in your room?

54:04.840 --> 54:05.940
I...

54:07.870 --> 54:09.270
would like to see the stars.

54:41.410 --> 54:42.510
My lord.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.640
I love how things are.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.920
I love having you with me

54:51.450 --> 54:54.450
and being able to do what I am good at.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.520
All I wanted was to find happiness,

55:01.360 --> 55:02.960
and I have.

55:08.030 --> 55:09.170
I am happy.

55:18.210 --> 55:19.510
Me too.

55:20.610 --> 55:23.880
The time I spend with you
means everything to me,

55:24.650 --> 55:26.820
and I am happy to enjoy

55:27.950 --> 55:29.090
every meal with you.

55:35.430 --> 55:36.460
Jo-yi.

55:39.230 --> 55:40.430
Will you

55:41.130 --> 55:43.300
accompany me on my life journey?

55:52.110 --> 55:53.180
Yes, my lord.

56:13.870 --> 56:19.540
[Mokkoji]

56:25.040 --> 56:28.510
Did I not tell you to
put things back in their rightful places?

56:28.880 --> 56:32.450
Unbelievable.
One litters while one cleans up.

56:34.250 --> 56:37.990
Who are you to say such a thing
when this is technically my room?

56:38.090 --> 56:40.030
It is why I have been cleaning up.

56:41.830 --> 56:44.500
You do not seem to wash your feet
before going to bed.

56:44.700 --> 56:47.970
Your constant nagging is killing me!

56:48.530 --> 56:50.970
Wash thoroughly and I will stop.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.340
It will be easier if you leave this room.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.370
Fine. As if that scares me.

56:55.470 --> 56:58.080
-Take your belongings with you.
-Fine.

57:03.650 --> 57:04.720
But...

57:05.480 --> 57:09.650
[Thank you for watching
Secret Royal Inspector Joy.]

57:22.930 --> 57:25.040
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

57:25.100 --> 57:26.870
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:38.980 --> 57:40.390
[We thank Jo Kwan-woo and Jo Eun-soul
for their special appearance.]

57:43.020 --> 57:45.520
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

57:46.160 --> 57:47.160
Here we go.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.460
You're such a goofball.

57:49.460 --> 57:51.400
-Were you mimicking me?
-Yes.

57:55.530 --> 57:56.700
The two of us?

57:56.800 --> 57:58.070
-One, two.
-One, two.

58:01.910 --> 58:03.410
Please get up, my lord.

58:03.540 --> 58:04.610
I am leaving.

58:05.580 --> 58:06.980
Are you abandoning me?

58:07.050 --> 58:09.180
Yes, late-night snacks await me.

58:10.850 --> 58:11.980
Get ready.

58:12.580 --> 58:13.750
Hurry.

58:15.490 --> 58:16.290
Get ready.

58:16.350 --> 58:17.560
It was Yi-eon.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.860
Didn't I wrap her up well?

58:20.230 --> 58:21.360
-Did you wrap her in this?
-Yes.

58:21.430 --> 58:22.360
I feel snug.

58:22.460 --> 58:24.800
It's cold, so bring it in.

58:26.930 --> 58:29.470
You only hugged me
because the camera was filming!

58:30.200 --> 58:32.100
-No wonder.
-What?

58:32.570 --> 58:33.940
At least the food...

58:34.170 --> 58:35.070
I'm sorry about that.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.640
They must be exhausted too,

58:37.710 --> 58:39.940
so let us prepare a meal for them.

58:41.080 --> 58:42.280
I am not interested...

58:45.720 --> 58:47.650
Cut!

58:48.120 --> 58:49.750
This isn't easy to aim for.

58:50.090 --> 58:51.490
Look forward.

58:52.090 --> 58:53.490
-Look straight ahead.
-Got it.

58:58.100 --> 58:59.100
Version Two.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.440
We were sitting down.
Why are we lying down now?

59:14.610 --> 59:15.810
What happened?

59:16.450 --> 59:18.720
-You must be so hot.
-Can someone wipe Jo-yi's sweat?

59:18.780 --> 59:21.720
Yes, seriously.
She's sweating under her nose.

59:23.490 --> 59:25.390
Do you guys need the fan?

59:25.460 --> 59:28.290
-That is how you can help me.
-No, you cannot go alone.

59:29.330 --> 59:30.630
That was too sleazy. Don't do that.

59:34.300 --> 59:36.370
-Cut.
-Cut.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.340
-From here...
-This is the problem.

59:39.700 --> 59:41.140
The beads are in the way.

59:43.610 --> 59:45.440
I am busy, so I must get going.

59:50.420 --> 59:51.920
She's really fast.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.620
My, that was like when she goes home
after filming all her scenes.

59:55.690 --> 59:57.890
I am busy, so I must get going.

59:59.120 --> 1:00:00.890
Shouldn't I get up close to her?

1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:03.190
-Yes.
-No, go away.

1:00:05.130 --> 1:00:06.230
I said, go away.

1:00:06.300 --> 1:00:08.270
Hey, it's just a game.

1:00:09.870 --> 1:00:11.870
-We'll tell you when to start.
-Try to be as hideous as possible.

1:00:12.700 --> 1:00:14.140
You look like Jafar.

1:00:14.910 --> 1:00:16.170
Jafar from "Aladdin."

1:00:17.540 --> 1:00:18.510
Yes.

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:20.680
-Are you people filming something here?
-Yes, we're filming.

1:00:20.750 --> 1:00:23.080
Sorry. It looks like fun.

1:00:23.150 --> 1:00:24.280
-Really?
-Yes.

1:00:24.350 --> 1:00:26.420
♫ Great, so great ♫

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:28.820
-Nice.
-♫ So great ♫

1:00:28.890 --> 1:00:30.790
-♫ So great ♫
-Watch where you step!

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:33.220
-Cut.
-Cut.

1:00:36.430 --> 1:00:37.500
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

1:00:38.230 --> 1:00:39.530
Isn't that too much?

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.500
-Why?
-Yes!
