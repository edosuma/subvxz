gonna leave that there?

38:06.333 --> 38:07.767
What's the
matter with that?

38:07.900 --> 38:09.734
Because you told us you
didn't want anything on

38:09.867 --> 38:12.033
the furniture so people
could see the stuff.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.367
Well, where do you want it?
Actually, you guys are

38:13.500 --> 38:14.834
doing a pretty job here,
I must say.

38:14.967 --> 38:16.100
That's why I'm asking you,

38:16.233 --> 38:17.133

leave it there?

38:17.266 --> 38:18.433
Well, where's
your typewriter shelf?

38:18.567 --> 38:21.266
- Over there.
- Space for more.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.033
That sits pretty good up there.
- We'll move a couple things.

38:23.166 --> 38:24.934
Perfect, alright.

stuff for movies and TV.

All these little things,

39:00.433 --> 39:01.367

million telephones,

39:01.500 --> 39:03.166

Oh my gosh. That's nice.

39:07.133 --> 39:09.266

supplies that matches this era,

sets of that,

39:11.100 --> 39:12.066
we might as well
finish it off.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.667

the pencil sharpeners.

Oh, you got
pencil sharpeners too?
