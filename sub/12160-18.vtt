WEBVTT

00:03.852 --> 00:05.619
Pardon me, miss?

00:07.321 --> 00:09.422
I'm looking for Mike Baxter.

00:09.490 --> 00:11.725
- Actually, it's "ma'am."
- Ah.

00:11.793 --> 00:13.794
- My mistake.
- Hey.

00:13.861 --> 00:15.095
How are you?

00:15.163 --> 00:16.897
You guys all know
my kid brother Jimmy, right?

00:16.964 --> 00:18.298
Hey.

00:18.365 --> 00:20.967
And you all know
my personal masseuse, Ramone?

00:21.035 --> 00:22.634
Hey.

00:22.703 --> 00:24.269
They'll wave at anything,
won't they?

00:24.337 --> 00:26.906
Well, they probably think you're
that special needs visitor

00:26.973 --> 00:29.274
- that's coming by to take a tour of the store.
- Ah.

00:29.342 --> 00:31.110
Yes. Keep talking, brother.

00:31.178 --> 00:33.179
The only special need
you're gonna have to worry about

00:33.246 --> 00:36.015
is learning how to speak
without your teeth.

00:36.083 --> 00:39.117
So you still think you could
take your older brother?

00:39.185 --> 00:42.286
With my eyes closed
d d my feet in cement.

00:42.354 --> 00:45.223
Which is pretty much how you
played little league baseball.

00:46.926 --> 00:49.194
"I'm scared. I'm scared."

00:49.261 --> 00:52.496
Okay. That one actually
hurt a little.

00:52.564 --> 00:53.964
So what are you doing
in Denver?

00:54.032 --> 00:56.466
You run out of
social diseases out in Durango?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.936
Ah. You getting
a little senile?

00:59.003 --> 01:01.171
I'm here to talk with Ed
about the bid

01:01.239 --> 01:03.673
to build your new store
out by the airport.

01:03.742 --> 01:05.342
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05.409 --> 01:07.410
Ed!

01:09.313 --> 01:10.346
Jim!

01:10.413 --> 01:12.414
Hey, Edward.

01:12.482 --> 01:14.717
- Good to see you, Ed. How are you?
- Thank you. Good to see you.

01:14.785 --> 01:18.955
- Great.
- Michael, I'm seriously considering letting Jim build

01:19.022 --> 01:22.225
our next store in Thornton. Huh?
Pending your okay, of course.

01:22.292 --> 01:23.525
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

01:23.593 --> 01:24.593
Uh, we gotta talk
in your office for a minute.

01:24.661 --> 01:25.761
We'll be right back out.

01:25.828 --> 01:27.229
I'll just spread out here.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.864
Dot t touch any of my stuff.

01:30.266 --> 01:32.200
Listen, Ed, why are you always

01:32.268 --> 01:34.970
springing stuff on me
without any warning?

01:35.037 --> 01:37.705
"Always"?
Name one other time.

01:37.774 --> 01:39.074
Off the top of my head,

01:39.142 --> 01:42.009
how about the "exotic elf"
at the Christmas party?

01:42.077 --> 01:46.247
I had no idea she was gonna
take her clothes off.

01:47.448 --> 01:50.985
The kids were in shock.

01:51.052 --> 01:54.021
If it's any consolation,
later on in the evening,

01:54.089 --> 01:57.224
she stole my TV set.

01:57.292 --> 02:01.427
When we talked about my brother
coming here to bid on this,

02:01.495 --> 02:04.164
I said I don't mix
business and family.

02:04.231 --> 02:06.632
Come on. Your brother's been
doing construction for 25 years.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.934
Yeah, but if we give him
this job,

02:08.002 --> 02:09.401
he's gonna be around here
for a year.

02:09.469 --> 02:10.636
So?

02:10.704 --> 02:12.505
I can't even be
on a touch football team

02:12.572 --> 02:14.940
with a guy like that.
He'll have to play quarterback.

02:15.008 --> 02:17.309
I'm a receiver.
He sends me on the wrong route!

02:17.376 --> 02:18.977
I'm in the end zone,
going like this--

02:19.045 --> 02:21.413
"I'm open! I'm open! I'm open!
For the love--"

02:21.480 --> 02:24.016
yeah! And that's just what
he did, like this.

02:24.083 --> 02:26.751
This-- this sounds--
sounds like a classic case

02:26.820 --> 02:28.553
of two alpha males
fighting for turf,

02:28.621 --> 02:33.791
like-- like-- like monkeys
or-- or aggressive tree roots.

02:35.227 --> 02:37.594
Don't get me wrong.
I love my idiot brother.

02:37.662 --> 02:42.633
Yeah. In my experience, fighting
and loving go hand in hand.

02:42.701 --> 02:45.002
That's why
your second wife shot you.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.939
Then we made love
in the ambulance.

02:51.142 --> 02:53.376
You decide about working with
Jim, but I'll tell you this--

02:53.444 --> 02:56.412
it was a hell of a bid,
and they have some great ideas.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.048
"They"?

02:58.115 --> 03:00.050
Is my dad involved in this?

03:03.053 --> 03:05.054
Michael, don't sucuch.

03:05.839 --> 03:08.389

03:15.498 --> 03:17.233
Hey, w-what are you doing?

03:17.300 --> 03:19.433
Just deleting
all your "hoarders" episodes.

03:19.501 --> 03:25.139
Well, don't, don't. They make me
feel good about my closet.

03:26.475 --> 03:28.843
Mom, you have
more than 20 saved up.

03:28.911 --> 03:32.080
You know, mother, you're
actually hoarding "hoarders."

03:34.249 --> 03:37.484
Hey, everybody,
we got a visitor alert.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.319
Hey, hey.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.420
Jimmy!

03:40.488 --> 03:41.989
- Hi.
- Hey, guys. Oh, my God.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.024
- Hey. Mwah. Hi.
- Look at you. Hey, beautiful.

03:44.092 --> 03:46.559
You are still
way too gorgeous for my brother.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.628
Oh, stop, stop.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.197
Ah, no, one more thing.
Say one more nice thing.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.066
You smell pretty.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.103
Aw. Honey, how come you never
say things like that?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.638
Because I already have ya.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.541
Yeah. Please, big hug.
Let me look at you.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.311
I'm trying to remember which
one of you I like the best.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.311
It's me.

04:06.379 --> 04:07.745
It was you, briefly.

04:07.813 --> 04:11.383
Mike. Where do I plug in
the sewage pipe for my RV?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.084
Where did we do it last time?

04:13.152 --> 04:15.453
The Wongs',
and they didn't like it.

04:15.521 --> 04:18.856
- Hello, beautiful. Mm.
- Oh, my good-- mwah. Ohh. Good to see you.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.825
Gosh, why didn't you two
tell us you were coming?

04:20.892 --> 04:22.359
We didn't want
to be any trouble.

04:22.427 --> 04:25.195
You'd just be out buying food,
cleaning the guest rooms.

04:25.263 --> 04:27.531
- Yeah.
- Uh, where you going?

04:27.598 --> 04:31.135
I'm gonna go buy food,
clean the guest rooms...

04:31.202 --> 04:35.406
- Remember, I like red meat. It does not like me.
- Yeah.

04:35.473 --> 04:40.209
Trust me, dad, that is something
that, uh, we will never forget.

04:42.212 --> 04:44.547
Why were you trying
to pass me on the freeway?

04:44.614 --> 04:46.115
Why didn't you <i>let</i> me pass you?

04:46.183 --> 04:47.483
Because I'm leading you
to my house.

04:47.551 --> 04:50.553
I know where you live,
<i>and</i> your way is stupid.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.855
My way's stupid? Well, your--
your way is stupider.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.022
I know how to get
to your house.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.424
- It's not a stupid thing--
- ladies.

04:55.491 --> 04:56.658
And ugly.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.795
This is us in 30 years.

05:00.863 --> 05:02.130
Who wants a beer?

05:02.198 --> 05:03.531
Yeah.

05:04.976 --> 05:06.935
What kind do you have?

05:07.003 --> 05:08.971
The free kind.

05:09.038 --> 05:10.972
Sounds good.

05:11.006 --> 05:14.208
Pop. Take a load off.
I'll go get the bags.

05:14.276 --> 05:16.777
Do it. Don't brag about it.

05:20.515 --> 05:22.816
You girls...

05:22.884 --> 05:25.286
You're so beautiful.

05:25.354 --> 05:27.653
I'm sorry your grandma
couldn't see you all grown up.

05:27.721 --> 05:29.722
Do you still miss her, grandpa?

05:29.790 --> 05:31.824
Sure, I do. She was
my soulmate, you know?

05:31.892 --> 05:34.527
They only come around
once in a lifetime.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.130
Do you still set her place
at the dinner table?

05:37.198 --> 05:40.333
No. That would be creepy.

05:45.405 --> 05:48.374
So, grandpa, what do you do
with all your time?

05:48.441 --> 05:51.143
I fill my days. I, uh,
help Jim run the business.

05:51.211 --> 05:53.778
A little chess in the park.

05:53.846 --> 05:58.582
I write angry letters
to a variety of publications.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.418
Hey, can I get you anything?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.120
- Yeah, I'm a little peckish.
- Yeah?

06:02.187 --> 06:04.555
Why don't you grab
those pistachios over there?

06:04.623 --> 06:05.456
Why don't all three of us
get them?

06:05.524 --> 06:06.457
'Cause it's a tiny bowl?

06:06.525 --> 06:07.892
Just come with me.

06:09.832 --> 06:12.630
Guys, grandpa seems
really lonely.

06:12.697 --> 06:14.164
Where did you
get that from?

06:14.232 --> 06:15.932
The way he talks about Nana.
You know, it's been Five years.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.967
- I think n needs to meet someone.
- No, no.

06:18.036 --> 06:19.169
No, no, no. Mandy, we are not
gonna set grandpa up.

06:19.237 --> 06:20.370
Why not?

06:20.438 --> 06:23.573
Because this isn't
a 1950s musical.

06:25.389 --> 06:27.210
Hey, what's holding up my nuts?

06:29.000 --> 06:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:36.353 --> 06:39.621
So Ed's gonna let Baxter & sons
build the new store?

06:39.689 --> 06:42.358
It's worse.
He says it's my decision.

06:42.426 --> 06:44.226
So what are you gonna do?

06:44.294 --> 06:45.561
I'm not gonna let him build it.

06:45.628 --> 06:47.762
Jim turns everything
into a competition,

06:47.829 --> 06:50.365
and I'm not gonna let him win.

06:52.101 --> 06:54.269
Well, your dad'll be there.
Won't he keep the peace?

06:54.336 --> 06:56.304
Right.
He likes it when we fight.

06:56.372 --> 06:58.940
I think it's
what keeps him alive.

06:59.007 --> 07:00.007
Come on!

07:00.076 --> 07:01.409
I'm not kidding.

07:01.477 --> 07:05.612
Every time Jim and I argue,
my dad's skin looks better.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.415
Well, honey,
maybe this is a good thing.

07:08.483 --> 07:09.883
I mean, I-I think

07:09.951 --> 07:12.119
Jimmy's always been a little
jealous of your success.

07:12.187 --> 07:14.054
I mean, maybe this will
bring you closer.

07:14.122 --> 07:15.822
We <i>are</i> close.

07:15.890 --> 07:17.324
Well, you see each other,
what, three times a year?

07:17.392 --> 07:18.824
What do you even talk about?

07:18.892 --> 07:23.196
Everything-- sports, the Broncos,
how the team's doing...

07:23.263 --> 07:26.932
Honey, those are one thing.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.735
Would you go in business
with your sister?

07:29.803 --> 07:30.970
Which one? April or Teri?

07:31.037 --> 07:31.937
Teri.

07:32.005 --> 07:33.172
No.

07:34.407 --> 07:35.407
April?

07:35.475 --> 07:37.008
<i>No.</i>

07:38.544 --> 07:41.580
Why did you say,
"which one?"

07:41.647 --> 07:44.548
You know, my sisters--

07:44.616 --> 07:48.285
they're-- they're varying degrees
of crazy, but Jim-- Jim's not.

07:48.353 --> 07:49.553
Come on.

07:49.621 --> 07:51.555
Can't you just put aside
your family issues

07:51.623 --> 07:53.124
and give the guy a chance?

07:54.792 --> 07:57.595
I hate it when you think
I'm a better man than I am.

08:01.432 --> 08:03.699
Hey, Mike. You need a hand
with anything?

08:03.767 --> 08:07.237
Like, um...
Getting me that beer?

08:07.304 --> 08:08.838
How about I get you a job?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.873
Why don't you build
the Outdoor Man?

08:13.310 --> 08:15.578
That's a good call.

08:15.646 --> 08:17.946
"Good call."

08:18.014 --> 08:19.781
That's it?

08:19.849 --> 08:23.084
What do you want me to do?
Kiss your loafers?

08:23.153 --> 08:24.586
It's a good call.

08:24.654 --> 08:25.987
No, but I-- you know.

08:26.055 --> 08:28.223
I'm asking you to build
an 80,000-square-foot building,

08:28.291 --> 08:31.326
maybe some guys would say,
"thank you."

08:31.394 --> 08:34.529
- Brother, I'm gonna hand you the best Outdoor Man...
- I-I know you are.

08:34.596 --> 08:36.096
- In the history of Outdoor Men...
- No, I understand all that. I unders--

08:36.164 --> 08:39.667
so I'm thinking some guys
would say, "you're welcome."

08:41.703 --> 08:43.703
- <i>Y-you're</i> welcome.
- Right. "You're welcome." It's easy.

08:43.772 --> 08:45.239
- No, <i>you're</i> welcome.
- No, you're totally welcome.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.208
- You start with a "thank you"...
- Listen, this is--

08:47.328 --> 08:48.789
my pleasure. You're welcome.

08:48.909 --> 08:49.876
- No, you're welcome.
- You are welcome.

08:49.943 --> 08:53.346
- You're welcome.
- Welcome!

08:53.414 --> 08:56.816
It starts-- it star--
gee, thank you.

08:59.126 --> 09:01.788
You're welcome?

09:10.211 --> 09:11.277
Hey, Ed.

09:11.345 --> 09:12.579
Oh, there you are.

09:12.647 --> 09:14.147
I got your emergency text.
What's the problem?

09:14.215 --> 09:15.516
Yeah, uh...

09:15.583 --> 09:17.618
You see
the fetching sandwich lady

09:17.685 --> 09:19.853
over there? Hmm?

09:21.556 --> 09:22.789
What's her name?

09:22.857 --> 09:24.858
Uh... Jackie.

09:24.926 --> 09:26.726
J-Jackie! Yes, that's it.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.928
Thank you
very much. Thank you thanks.

09:28.996 --> 09:30.897
This is precisely why

09:30.964 --> 09:34.033
I never wanted you to have
my cell phone number.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.369
- Come on now, come on now.
- Now why the frosty tone?

09:37.437 --> 09:39.371
Gee, I'm sorry, Ed,
but I'm a little busy.

09:39.439 --> 09:42.908
Got to head to the bank with
proper construction permits,

09:42.975 --> 09:44.943
get my brother a loan
so he can build a building

09:45.011 --> 09:47.045
so I can be his boss
so he can resent me

09:47.112 --> 09:48.880
and probably kill me
with a backhoe.

09:48.948 --> 09:50.949
Have a great morning.

09:51.017 --> 09:52.617
Are we still hung up on this?

09:52.685 --> 09:54.786
"Still"?
This just happened yesterday.

09:54.854 --> 09:56.888
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

09:56.956 --> 09:59.790
Look, you pout all the way
to the bank, but remember this--

09:59.858 --> 10:02.392
your brother has been living
a little under your shadow,

10:02.460 --> 10:03.761
and that can't be easy.

10:03.828 --> 10:04.995
What's the point, Ed?

10:05.063 --> 10:06.797
Point is it takes
two people to fight.

10:06.865 --> 10:08.498
You don't have to
be one of them.

10:10.035 --> 10:12.069
I hate it when you and my wife

10:12.136 --> 10:14.150
think I'm a better guy
than I really am.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.107
Jackie, yes...

10:20.243 --> 10:21.744
Hello, Jackie.

10:21.812 --> 10:24.577
Who's Jackie?

10:35.222 --> 10:37.125
Look at all of those
cute little old ladies

10:37.193 --> 10:41.719
looking for little old men.
Look at her hat. She's fancy.

10:42.966 --> 10:44.666
What's going on?

10:44.734 --> 10:46.400
Oh, just looking for
a love match for grandpa.

10:46.468 --> 10:47.835
Oh, and, guys,
just so you know,

10:47.903 --> 10:48.836
I set up this couple
at my school,

10:48.904 --> 10:50.004
and now she's pregnant,

10:50.072 --> 10:52.396
so, pretty sure
I know what I'm doing.

10:58.647 --> 11:00.948
Okay. Who do we got?

11:01.016 --> 11:02.482
Oh, okay, um...

11:02.549 --> 11:07.153
"Fun-loving widow looking
for a rugged gentleman to..."

11:11.025 --> 11:14.260
Really? At that age?

11:18.564 --> 11:20.499
I don't even know
why you're here.

11:20.566 --> 11:22.868
I think I know how to ge
a loan for start-up costs.

11:22.936 --> 11:24.169
Listen, I'm just making sure

11:24.237 --> 11:26.371
it's properly licensed
and permitted.

11:26.439 --> 11:28.373
You really are a nerd,
aren't you?

11:28.441 --> 11:29.808
Ugh.

11:29.876 --> 11:30.776
Hi, guys. Richard Clark.

11:30.844 --> 11:31.877
Hey, Richard.

11:31.945 --> 11:32.911
Good to see you again,
Mr. Baxter.

11:32.979 --> 11:34.245
We know each other?

11:34.312 --> 11:35.613
I went to school
with your daughter Kristin.

11:35.681 --> 11:36.914
Ah.

11:36.982 --> 11:40.417
Tell her Richard says, "hello."

11:40.485 --> 11:42.620
Why are you laughing at that?

11:42.688 --> 11:45.123
I'm thinking he got some.

11:47.325 --> 11:48.425
You asked a qutition

11:48.493 --> 11:50.127
and, uh, you must be
James Baxter,

11:50.194 --> 11:51.128
the loan applicant.

11:51.195 --> 11:52.529
That's right.

11:52.596 --> 11:55.231
Well, James.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.167
Looked over
your request, and...

11:57.234 --> 11:59.870
I've got to say, I'm a little
concerned about your assets.

11:59.937 --> 12:02.091
"Concerned" how, Spanky?

12:05.242 --> 12:07.376
- Imagine we're talking about doughnuts.
- Okay.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.845
I wish you had
a large box of doughnuts,

12:09.913 --> 12:13.315
but instead, you've only got,
like, seven doughnuts.

12:13.383 --> 12:14.316
Yeah.

12:14.384 --> 12:16.272
I need more doughnuts.

12:18.121 --> 12:20.222
Look, my brother just needs
seed money for the project.

12:20.290 --> 12:21.657
Mike, I think I got this.

12:21.724 --> 12:23.457
Really?
Doing a good job so far,

12:23.525 --> 12:26.728
letting a college sophomore
turn you down for a loan.

12:26.796 --> 12:29.731
Yoyou're, uh...
Yoyou're turning me do?

12:29.832 --> 12:33.434
Just, you're a a--
you're a little overextended

12:33.502 --> 12:35.770
what happened
all your doughnuts?

12:35.805 --> 12:38.338
Last couple projects,
we built on spec.

12:38.372 --> 12:40.074
We haven't unloaded'em yet.
It's not a big deal.

12:40.141 --> 12:41.575
Is that what this is about?

12:41.642 --> 12:43.376
- Wait, wait, "on spec"?
- Don't lecture me.

12:43.477 --> 12:44.842
You're not supposed
to use your doughnuts.

12:46.781 --> 12:48.481
I mean, if you have to
use a couple of your doughnuts,

12:48.549 --> 12:51.085
then you come to a clown like
this for the other doughnuts.

12:52.587 --> 12:54.721
What are you laughing about?

12:54.755 --> 12:56.122
I'm not.
It's just a nervous tic.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.314
Well, take some medicine.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.362
No way,
I-I think you should reapply,

13:03.430 --> 13:05.598
you know after the economy bounces back.

13:05.632 --> 13:08.300
Yah. That's great come on, Mike.

13:08.368 --> 13:10.902
Wait a sec, wait a second.

13:12.538 --> 13:15.473
Whatt if I cosign the loan as an executive of Outdoor Man?

13:15.541 --> 13:16.842
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
- Just listen up.

13:16.909 --> 13:18.343
Well, that would certainly
change things.

13:18.410 --> 13:20.212
I'm not asking you to do that.

13:20.279 --> 13:21.847
I know you're not,
but you heard Richie Rich.

13:21.914 --> 13:24.216
You're not getting the loan
otherwise.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.553
Would you do this
for another contractor?

13:29.621 --> 13:31.321
No.

13:31.389 --> 13:32.389
Right. Forget it.

13:32.457 --> 13:34.191
I may not have
enough doughnuts,

13:34.259 --> 13:35.692
but I still have my pride.
No deal.

13:35.761 --> 13:37.194
Don't be a baby about this.

13:37.262 --> 13:39.163
"Baby"?
Hey, I'm not being a baby.

13:39.231 --> 13:42.232
- I am the one who stayed home with dad...
- Oh, start this...

13:42.299 --> 13:44.768
- Start this--
- and kept the family business going while you ran off.

13:44.835 --> 13:45.902
- "Ran off"?
- Yeah.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.203
- How about college?
- Anyway, anyway...

13:47.271 --> 13:48.071
How about getting a career
and all that stuff?

13:48.139 --> 13:49.372
Thanks for coming in, and...

13:49.439 --> 13:51.374
Tell Kristin
that I own my own car now.

13:51.441 --> 13:52.942
Sit down, sport.
Look at this.

13:53.010 --> 13:55.578
We came here for a loan,
so don't be a martyr about dad.

13:55.646 --> 13:56.780
The only reason
<i>you</i> stayed with dad,

13:56.847 --> 13:59.514
'cause it was cheaper
and easier to do that.

13:59.582 --> 14:02.951
- <i>You</i> ran away.
- When we get out that parking lot,

14:03.019 --> 14:04.386
- <i>you'll</i> be running away.
- Oh, <i>I'm</i> gonna be running away.

14:04.453 --> 14:06.088
Unless you want to go here.

14:06.156 --> 14:07.522
- I would go here, yes.
- Let's do that. Let's go here.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:09.192 --> 14:10.793
I'm thinking the parking lot
might be better for fighting.

14:10.860 --> 14:12.127
There's more room.
It's well-lit.

14:12.195 --> 14:13.762
There's a little clinic
right across the street,

14:13.829 --> 14:16.397
in case you get hurt.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.766
You're right, kid.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.465
All right, now I want you
to keep an open mind,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.367
because love comes
in many forms.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.903
Who are these women?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.604
You're gonna pick that one,

14:31.672 --> 14:32.905
and then you're gonna
ask her out,

14:32.972 --> 14:34.173
and then you won't
be lonely anymore,

14:34.240 --> 14:35.908
and it's all because of me!

14:35.975 --> 14:37.910
Mandy.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.244
- Full disclosure...
- Yeah.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.046
I've got a girlfriend.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.981
What?

14:43.049 --> 14:47.652
Her name is Stella,
and she's a real spitfire.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.489
So you can't go to a senior
square dance at Nibblers?

14:54.026 --> 14:57.661
No, thanks. I'm more
of a salsa guy, anyway.

14:58.997 --> 15:00.998
See you later.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.466
Where you going?

15:02.534 --> 15:05.468
Meeting up with a hot grandma
for dinner, dancing, and then

15:05.536 --> 15:08.772
after that, we're gonna see
where the afternoon takes us.

15:10.374 --> 15:11.908
Yee-haw.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.947
Hey, dad.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.514
I am so glad you're here.

15:18.582 --> 15:19.549
Me, too.

15:19.617 --> 15:20.515
Yeah.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.817
Isn't it great,

15:21.885 --> 15:24.987
the way Jim and Mike
are getting along so well?

15:25.055 --> 15:27.757
Hmm.
That's your impression

15:27.824 --> 15:30.159
of what's happening
around here?

15:30.227 --> 15:31.460
Ah...

15:31.527 --> 15:33.362
They tussle
about this and that,

15:33.429 --> 15:35.397
but they're gonna love
working together.

15:36.732 --> 15:38.366
You're just trying
to show me up,

15:38.433 --> 15:40.534
like I can't
get a loan on my own.

15:40.602 --> 15:42.937
Because you <i>can't</i>
get the loan on your own!

15:43.005 --> 15:45.106
- What happened?
- I didn't get the loan.

15:45.174 --> 15:47.375
He could have got the loan
if he weren't so stubborn!

15:47.442 --> 15:48.843
- Oh--
- just let me cosign for it--

15:48.911 --> 15:50.311
pop, there are
a million other projects

15:50.379 --> 15:51.679
you and I could be working on

15:51.747 --> 15:54.481
without having to deal
with all <i>this.</i>

15:56.484 --> 15:58.718
What do the hand gestures mean?

15:58.787 --> 16:00.087
It means you're not fooling me.

16:00.155 --> 16:02.156
You're trying
to rub my face in it

16:02.223 --> 16:03.690
and make me feel like a loser.

16:03.758 --> 16:05.793
Or maybe it's a brother trying
to help another brother out,

16:05.860 --> 16:07.927
- who deserves a shot. Maybe that's all!
- All right, all right. Stop!

16:07.995 --> 16:09.461
I've had enough
of you two guys!

16:09.529 --> 16:12.598
Neither one of you's too big
to put over my knee replacement.

16:18.205 --> 16:19.906
You know what, pop?

16:19.973 --> 16:22.175
I can't deal with this guy.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.609
The project is dead.
All right?

16:24.677 --> 16:26.311
If you need me, I'll be in the RV,

16:26.378 --> 16:28.780
opening a can of beans.

16:28.848 --> 16:31.817
Not the beans! The beans are for
when the government takes over!

16:37.523 --> 16:40.124
What is going on here?

16:40.192 --> 16:42.026
You know what?

16:42.093 --> 16:43.694
Maybe this isn't
just about you and Jimmy

16:43.761 --> 16:45.830
and-- and building a store.

16:45.897 --> 16:47.531
What do you mean?

16:47.598 --> 16:48.799
Look at what
your father did to the paper.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.937
Hillary's always
had a mustache.

16:55.906 --> 16:59.742
No, the real estate section.
He's circling apartment ads.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.911
Your father wants to move here.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.179
Why?

17:03.247 --> 17:05.214
"Why?" "Why?"
Because the project's here,

17:05.281 --> 17:08.151
his family's here.
I mean, just put it together.

17:08.219 --> 17:10.185
He wants to be near
his granddaughters,

17:10.253 --> 17:12.320
his great-grandson, <i>you.</i>

17:12.387 --> 17:15.858
And for God sake, the van
does say "Baxter & <i>sons."</i>

17:17.727 --> 17:21.864
You figured all that out
by these red circles, huh?

17:21.931 --> 17:24.266
It's a knack.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.868
Never let 'em tell you
women aren't smart.

17:30.805 --> 17:31.939
Who said that?

17:32.007 --> 17:33.374
It's not important.

17:33.441 --> 17:35.442
Who? Who?

17:35.510 --> 17:36.978
- I-I--
- Is it somebody at work?

17:37.045 --> 17:38.246
- No, it's not--
- Give me a name. Name one person.

17:38.313 --> 17:39.947
- No, I'm not sa--
- one per-- name one person.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.916
Was it the idiots
down at the loading dock?

17:41.984 --> 17:44.251
- Forget the loading dock...
- Can't think of anybody?

17:48.555 --> 17:50.357
What are you guys doing here?

17:50.424 --> 17:52.859
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

17:52.927 --> 17:56.396
It's my office.

17:56.463 --> 17:59.866
Ooh. Mike has an office.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.402
Ed called us here.

18:03.469 --> 18:04.803
He's not gonna
change my mind, pop.

18:04.871 --> 18:07.106
I'd rather build taco stands
for the rest of my life

18:07.173 --> 18:09.942
than have him cosign a loan
and lord it over me.

18:10.010 --> 18:13.078
Jim, does he lord it over you
that he saved your butt

18:13.146 --> 18:16.680
from that bully, Andy O'Connell,
in the seventh grade?

18:16.748 --> 18:19.984
How do you even remember
that kid's name?

18:20.052 --> 18:22.420
- Because Mike always--
- Dad, dad, dad.

18:28.493 --> 18:29.994
Oh, good.

18:30.062 --> 18:32.129
You'll all here.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.596
All right.

18:33.664 --> 18:35.032
Gentlemen...

18:35.099 --> 18:38.568
I'm giving the project over
to my second choice...

18:38.636 --> 18:39.970
Trumbull.

18:40.038 --> 18:41.704
Case closed.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.141
Trumbull?

18:44.208 --> 18:46.743
All right, you idiots.
You happy now?

18:47.912 --> 18:49.578
Ed. Those guys
are gangsters, man.

18:49.646 --> 18:51.047
They're gonna gouge you.

18:51.114 --> 18:53.082
Ed, Jim's right.
They're thieves. You know that.

18:53.150 --> 18:55.884
Eh, maybe, but they're thieves
with heavy equipment and, uh,

18:55.953 --> 18:59.121
an experienced crew,
and no infighting.

18:59.189 --> 19:02.391
Ed, wait.

19:02.459 --> 19:04.993
You're gonna let him do this?
What?

19:05.061 --> 19:06.594
What am I supposed
to do about it?

19:09.098 --> 19:12.367
I... cosign the loan.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.902
Why don't you use
your big-guy voice?

19:22.543 --> 19:24.445
Cosign the loan.

19:24.512 --> 19:27.614
Anything's better than giving
the business to those crooks.

19:27.682 --> 19:31.485
I thought you said
it made you feel a <i>loser.</i>

19:33.221 --> 19:36.356
Yeah, but then pop pointed out

19:36.423 --> 19:39.092
that your desk
doesn't have any drawers,

19:39.159 --> 19:42.495
so I feel a little better
about myself.

19:42.562 --> 19:46.466
It's very stylish.
Just don't call it a desk.

19:48.502 --> 19:50.470
Are you all right with this?

19:50.537 --> 19:52.770
Look, Mike,
if you're still willing...

19:52.838 --> 19:54.772
Yeah, I'm good.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.174
I'm willing. Let's do it.

19:56.242 --> 19:57.275
All right.
All right.

19:57.343 --> 19:59.211
Baxter &...

19:59.278 --> 20:01.146
- Sons.
- Yeah.

20:01.214 --> 20:03.615
This is a great day.
What happens next?

20:03.682 --> 20:05.350
I drive us to the bank.

20:05.418 --> 20:06.385
We'll use my car.

20:06.452 --> 20:08.652
You kind of drive
like miss Daisy.

20:10.855 --> 20:12.823
Well, actually, miss Daisy
didn't drive the car.

20:12.891 --> 20:14.225
That was the point
of the movie, you moron.

20:16.261 --> 20:17.694
I'll drive.

20:17.762 --> 20:19.330
Whoa, hey, you--

20:19.398 --> 20:20.531
- Mike is a fine driver.
- No, you go ahead.

20:20.598 --> 20:22.033
- Would you drive?
- No problem.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.934
- I'm super confident.
- You just sit, dad.

20:24.002 --> 20:25.368
- Kind of slow, but we'll get there.
- Not driving a tractor.

20:25.436 --> 20:27.570
We could even take
his old truck.

20:27.638 --> 20:30.073
- I'll tell you what, I'd rather take--
- you're such a-- you know what?

20:35.698 --> 20:37.683
Yeah, Jim Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

20:37.803 --> 20:39.904
letting you know that
we're, uh, locked and loaded

20:39.972 --> 20:42.541
- for our big sale on over-under shotguns.
- Come on, brother, brother, come on, lookit.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.342
Lookit. <i>"Locked</i> and loaded." Punch the words.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.810
<i>"Locked"--
"locked</i> and loaded."

20:45.878 --> 20:47.478
I can think of something
I'd like to punch, honestly.

20:47.546 --> 20:48.745
Is this like Andy O'Connell?

20:48.813 --> 20:50.447
If I hadn't
yanked the kid off you,

20:50.515 --> 20:52.183
- he would have kicked your ass. Instead, I kicked his ass...
- Hey.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.117
- And you look far better--
- you know what? It's time to go.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.653
- Oh, let's do it.
- Come on.

21:01.893 --> 21:06.262
Hoo. Still is big brother
around <i>here.</i>

21:10.668 --> 21:12.134
Hey...

21:15.706 --> 21:17.973
Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

21:18.041 --> 21:21.009
We are locked and loaded
for our new-- look who's up.

21:21.077 --> 21:22.611
Hey, remember me?

21:25.381 --> 21:27.115
Aah!

21:27.183 --> 21:28.783
Let go of that!

21:28.851 --> 21:29.951
Aah!
