Frank Wills.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.743
<i>I found a piece of tape</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.478
<i>on the parking garage door.</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:11.645
I thought it was a mistake
the first time,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.214
and then it happened again,

00:13.247 --> 00:15.383
<i>and I found another piece
on the sixth floor.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:18.119
Wow, wow,
you really saved the day here.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.653
Well, I'm just glad
I could represent myself

00:19.687 --> 00:20.721
on behalf of the building.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.156
The president
and the first lady

00:22.189 --> 00:24.458
would like to gift you
a little getaway weekend.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.227
<i>Something to tide you over

00:26.260 --> 00:28.429
<i>can spring
for the real honeymoon.</i>

00:28.462 --> 00:29.663
And look, it'll be good
to have a little time

00:29.697 --> 00:30.731
away from the city to write

00:30.765 --> 00:32.299
that investigative report,
right?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.368
I could be indicted
for obstruction of justice.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.203
I entrusted the task
of getting me

00:36.237 --> 00:38.172
<i>the written report
to John Dean.</i>

00:39.306 --> 00:40.441
We're gonna have you
tell the truth

00:40.474 --> 00:42.710
in a way
that America likes you.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.545
Convicted
Watergate conspirators

00:44.578 --> 00:47.815

at the formal hearings.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.316
<i>The ship's going down, John.</i>

00:49.350 --> 00:51.619
It might be best
if I explore other options.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.488
Uh, Mr. Mitchell,
if you ever need anything,

00:54.522 --> 00:55.523
I'm right outside your door.

00:56.791 --> 00:57.758
Oh, here we go.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.093
<i>Should the Nixon administration</i>

00:59.126 --> 01:00.528
be afraid of you,
Mrs. Mitchell?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.096
Well, I think you know
the answer to that.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.765
The committee called.
I'm gonna testify.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.753
Ah, hey, hey, hey.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.788
A-all right, all right,
all right, I'm up.

01:27.822 --> 01:30.157
I'm up, I'm up. Come on.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.159
Come on, Tu--Tuffy, come on.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.495
I got you, okay,
breakfast time.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.763
<i>That was pretty Patti Austin</i>

01:35.796 --> 01:38.165

Sometimes up, sometimes down.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.490
Are you dating anyone?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.458
Married? I don't see a ring.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.761
That depends.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.296
Who you asking for?

03:15.329 --> 03:17.264
Let's just say I have a feeling

03:17.298 --> 03:19.567
our female readers
might be interested.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.271
I was seeing someone
before all this, but, uh,

03:24.305 --> 03:26.240
she broke it off
a couple weeks ago.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.309
Mm, sorry to hear that.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.710
All right, Frank, we're good.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.345
All right.
My man. Thank you, sir.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.314
Yeah, uh, it's copacetic.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.885
Tuffy never really took kind
to her anyway.

03:37.918 --> 03:38.886
Tuffy?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.654
- He's my cat.
- Hmm.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.990
He can always tell when I'm
headed in the wrong direction,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.492
and he has a way
of letting me know it too.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.827
Sounds like a good companion.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.462
Cheap date too.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.364
Tuna's, what,
a quarter these days?

03:52.499 --> 03:53.767
Must be interesting
working in a building

03:53.801 --> 03:56.804
that's become the center
of a national scandal.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.773
Well, actually,
I'm not employed here anymore.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.308
Management let me go
a few weeks ago.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.878
Said I was... becoming
too much of a distraction.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.016
Anyway,
I'm looking for a new gig.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.518
I'm not saying
they shut me out, but...

04:11.552 --> 04:12.920
it's been a lot harder
than I thought it'd be.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.365

04:24.398 --> 04:25.799
My number.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.735
Don't get any ideas.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.470
I adjunct over at Howard.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.339
This <i>Jet</i> thing's
just freelance.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.508
I happen to know
that the security department

04:34.541 --> 04:35.743
needs a coordinator.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.877
- Coordinator?
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.612
Oh, shoot,
I can coordinate anything.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.880
See?

04:39.913 --> 04:42.616
Coordinated.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.784
I'll get you an interview.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.519
Mm-hmm. Great.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.721
And, um, after that?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.056
What you mean, "After that?"

04:49.289 --> 04:51.492
I was thinking...

04:51.525 --> 04:53.293
dinner, maybe?

04:53.327 --> 04:55.029
So when I said,
"Don't get any ideas"...

04:55.062 --> 04:56.430
I got 'em anyway.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.799

Ooh, this one's nice.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.118
You would've been proud

05:52.052 --> 05:53.821
Yeah, I made her laugh
and everything, uh,

06:55.616 --> 06:57.618
Oh, nice try.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.031

07:14.067 --> 07:15.702
You'll be testifying against
the president next week?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.504
Yes, yes, it is true,
but before that,

07:17.538 --> 07:20.107
I am focusing on my
goodwill trip to Pine Bluff.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.442
My daughter and I
are going down there.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.545
We're gonna go to a luncheon

07:24.578 --> 07:25.979
We'll be the honored guests.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.681

07:27.714 --> 07:28.782
No, I'm not.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.551

07:32.719 --> 07:33.821

07:33.854 --> 07:35.522

to the Senate?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.858
Oh, as usual, I support Martha

07:37.891 --> 07:40.027
in whatever she decides to do.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.029
Except there's
no deciding left to do.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.730
I am testifying on Monday.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.865
Right, that's the plan.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.700
Not the plan, the facts.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.072
I really think you should
think about spending

07:52.105 --> 07:53.707
a little more time down there.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.975
Might be very good for you

and for Marty too.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.548
Love you. Don't slam the door.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.720

do you have any thoughts

08:06.753 --> 08:08.889
on John Dean's
upcoming testimony?

08:08.922 --> 08:11.592

08:30.143 --> 08:31.645
As my lawyer
detailed earlier, I--

08:31.678 --> 08:33.146
I don't think you should
say "lawyer."

08:33.180 --> 08:34.581
Just say "my counsel,"

08:34.615 --> 08:37.017
'cause people do not
like lawyers--no offense.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.585
<i>Okay.</i>

08:38.619 --> 08:40.954
As my counsel detailed earlier,

08:40.988 --> 08:43.190
I maintain an extensive log
of clippings

08:43.223 --> 08:46.059
to which I refer
with some regularity.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.594
And how do these clippings

08:47.628 --> 08:48.896
relate to the question,
exactly?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.931
Uh, well, um...

08:50.964 --> 08:54.601
...my meetings with the--
with the president--no?

08:54.635 --> 08:57.671
Uh, I was often dealing

08:57.704 --> 08:59.172
with containment
of press issues--

08:59.206 --> 09:01.642
"Containment"?
I just think that sounds evil.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.677
I mean, what's he working on,
a nuclear reactor?

09:06.580 --> 09:07.881
I agree with that, actually.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.082
- Wh--
- Well, good.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.250
Well, what should
I call it, then?

09:10.284 --> 09:11.785
Don't call it anything.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.587
If a committee member
gives you a question like that,

09:13.620 --> 09:15.022
throw it to me,
and I'll answer it.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.890
No, no.
Won't that make him look weak?

09:21.962 --> 09:26.133
Why don't we take
a little break, okay?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.602
Sounds like the best idea
you've had all day.

09:28.635 --> 09:29.670
Okay.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.105
I think those are the ones.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.043
Baby-baby, I love
how much you're helping,

09:36.076 --> 09:39.246
how much you care, but...

09:39.279 --> 09:42.849
you know, trial prep is what
Shaffer does for a living.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.185
Why don't we let him
take the lead on this?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.754
But this isn't just
some stuffy jury trial, John.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.891

09:50.924 --> 09:51.959
Yeah.

against the world, huh?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.104
Yeah.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.640
Well, three of us now
'cause of the baby.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.075
Hmm?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.178
What--wait, what did you
just say?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.713
- Hmm?
- What? No.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.614
- What'd you just say? That--
- I didn't say anything.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.183
- No. Come on.
- Wait, you said something.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.784
- <i>Are you serious?</i>
- Are you pregnant?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.286
- Wait, really?
- Yup.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.988
Like, seven weeks, really.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.090
Oh, my God.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.324
Oh, jeez,
I don't wanna squash it.

10:24.358 --> 10:27.027
I'm so sorry. I--oh, my God.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.197
Wait, just take these off.
Come here.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.266
Oh, my God.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.207
<i>Whoa! Yay!</i>

10:40.240 --> 10:42.309
<i>- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Whoo!</i>

10:42.342 --> 10:44.211
<i>- Oh, yeah!
- Yee-haw!</i>

10:44.244 --> 10:46.113
<i>- Hey!
- Yeah!</i>

10:46.146 --> 10:49.683
<i>♪ Way down in Arkansas ♪</i>

10:49.716 --> 10:51.251
<i>♪ That's where I been

10:51.284 --> 10:53.153

- Oh, thank you.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.933
You're welcome.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.804
Do you smell that?
Pear trees in bloom.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.706
Smells like death.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.374
We should go later
by Gillan's Market,

11:14.408 --> 11:16.843
get some pears
and some potato salad.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.779
And then we can go
by Sampsons shoe store.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.081
Did I ever tell you
I was briefly a foot model?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.117
Did you come here a lot
when you were a kid?

11:24.151 --> 11:25.285
Oh, no.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.987
The country club
raised the drawbridge on us

11:27.020 --> 11:28.955
the day my daddy skipped town.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.024
My mama tried to charm
and cajole her way back in,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.259
but it was never gonna happen.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.761
These people have
a sixth sense for weakness.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.230
- That sounds scary.
- It is. Keep your guard up.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.901
Oh, my goodness, is that...

11:40.934 --> 11:43.270
Oh, it is. That's Susan Wales
and Henry Daniels.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.273
Hey, whoo, whoo! Henry! Susan!

11:46.306 --> 11:48.809
It's Martha Beall.
Class of '36.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.746
- Get in the car.
- Hey, Henry.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.182
Well, I guess
they didn't recognize me.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.225
Oh, look at the poster.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.493
Wow.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.997
Where are people?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.365
Where <i>are</i> people?

12:13.133 --> 12:16.103
Oh!

12:16.136 --> 12:18.772
I love its gentle warble.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.507
I love its gentle flow.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.509
I love to wind my tongue up.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.078
And I love to let it go!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.148
Oh, my God.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.449
I almost forgot about that.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.184
Oh, I wish I could.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.287
Come here, baby.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.090
This is one of Mama's
oldest friends, Lurleen Landry.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.291
Oh, my goodness.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.427
Oh, looking at you,
it's like--it's like

12:40.460 --> 12:42.329
looking in the past
and seeing an angel.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.832
You are just the perfect
picture of your mother.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.468
I would say attendance
seems a little light.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.505
Yeah, well,
you know, we had some

12:51.538 --> 12:53.273
last-minute cancellations.

12:53.306 --> 12:57.010
It seems your mama is quite the
controversial lady these days.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.446
Mm, I guess I didn't realize
being honest

12:59.479 --> 13:01.248
was so controversial.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.083
Oh, honey, this is Arkansas.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.118
It's too humid for honesty.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.187
You want some lemonade,
sweetheart?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.555
- Can I?
- Of course, darling.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.056
Sure.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.872
<i>And, uh, now, Mr. Magruder,</i>

13:25.906 --> 13:27.307
<i>I'd like
to turn the questions over</i>

13:27.340 --> 13:30.010
to my distinguished colleague
from Florida,

13:30.043 --> 13:31.478
Senator Edward Gurney.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.079
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.550
Mr. Magruder, over the course
of this hearing,

13:36.583 --> 13:39.953
you have struggled to put forth
a straightforward answer

13:39.986 --> 13:41.988
to even the most
elementary questions.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.391
So I will ask you once again.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.894
Did you at any point have
any operational knowledge

13:47.928 --> 13:50.363
of the break-in
at the Watergate complex?

13:54.568 --> 13:56.403
I do not recall, Senator.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.072
Were you aware

13:59.105 --> 14:01.841
that the proposed
espionage activities

14:01.875 --> 14:04.878
were to be paid for
using campaign funds?

14:07.447 --> 14:10.183
I do not recall, Senator.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.586
Do you recall
any of the directives

14:12.619 --> 14:14.354
that you, uh, undertook

14:14.387 --> 14:16.923
at the Committee
to Re-elect the President?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
Uh, well, uh, that would
have to depend, of course,

14:18.992 --> 14:22.162
on what directives
you were referring to, Senator,

14:22.195 --> 14:25.131
but, uh, in general,
I would have to say that--

14:25.165 --> 14:27.033
That you do not recall?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.369
Uh, yeah, that's correct, Senator.

14:29.402 --> 14:33.206
Son, did you suffer
some acute brain injury

14:33.240 --> 14:35.475
on your way into the rotunda
this morning?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.951
No, si--no, sir, I did n--
I did not.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.886
- Mr. Cookie Monster?
- Huh?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.155
Did you take the cookies?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.925
Uh...

14:53.960 --> 14:55.395
Me no recall.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.529
You don't recall?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.032
<i>Me fuzzy on that one.</i>

14:59.065 --> 15:00.033
<i>You're fuzzy, period.</i>

15:00.066 --> 15:01.234
<i>Uh, I object.</i>

15:01.268 --> 15:04.371
Oh, come on.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.372
That is funny.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.640
It-it-it's really not.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.409
That is Jeb up there.
Cookie Monster is-is Jeb.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.910
They made him
into a laughingstock,

15:10.944 --> 15:12.012
and they're gonna do
the same to me.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.413
Who am I gonna be, Beaker?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.349
The whole thing is-is designed
to make you look guilty.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.550
Baby, you're being paranoid.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.486
You're not on trial.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.954
Yet.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.922
I'm not on trial yet.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.991
If I fuck this up, I could be.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.993
I could kiss
my credibility goodbye.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.529
Well, you'll have
the Democratic senators

15:29.562 --> 15:30.664
on your side.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.300
Democrats.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.368
With friends like them,
who needs enemies?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.037
<i>Mm.</i>

15:37.070 --> 15:41.074
It doesn't matter what glasses
I wear or how much I rehearse.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.643
I'm facing off against the
president of the United States.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.046
How do I not look small
up there?

15:46.079 --> 15:49.215
<i>Uh, Mr. MacNeil, uh,
we-we've been sitting here...</i>

15:49.249 --> 15:50.450
You get rid of that guy.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.451
<i>...two and a half minutes</i>

15:51.484 --> 15:53.053
<i>answering your questions,</i>

15:53.086 --> 15:54.521
<i>and-and I just hope that
we can finish this up soon,</i>

15:54.554 --> 15:57.424
because my client here
is almost out of patience.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.993
Yeah,
almost out of cookies too.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.279
- Thank you.
- Wow.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.048
They don't call it
dragon rice for nothing.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.450
This is a lot.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.152
And yet there's more.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.455
Mambo sauce, trust me.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.229
Mm, no, no.

16:36.262 --> 16:39.366
You don't wanna drizzle.
You wanna bathe.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.370
You wanna just, like,

16:43.403 --> 16:45.105
really get nasty.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.409
Okay. Yeah.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.078
Yeah, that's it.
Mix it in good.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.648
Oh.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.359
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm not even
too good with these.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.094
Oh, shit.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.298
It's okay. Go ahead.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.504
- Oh, shit.
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.507
More. Give me some more.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.675
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.777
So you been keeping up

17:23.810 --> 17:26.446
with the latest
Watergate drama?

17:26.479 --> 17:28.782
Oh, um...

17:28.815 --> 17:31.184
you know, off and on.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.120
That Magruder testimony
was excruciating, wasn't it?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.322
- Magruder?
- Mm-hmm.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.558
He's the deputy
campaign director

17:38.591 --> 17:40.059
under John Mitchell.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.297
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Magruder.
Right on, yeah.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.465
Mm-hmm.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.133
I mean,
it's bad enough that Nixon

17:47.167 --> 17:49.569
is a narcissistic
crypto-fascist,

17:49.602 --> 17:51.171
but does he have
to surround himself

17:51.204 --> 17:53.273
with such hopeless dipshits?

17:56.176 --> 17:59.612
I'm sorry, you must be tired
of hearing about Watergate.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
It's not that. It's just...

18:01.681 --> 18:03.416
I was thinking about my cat.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.185
He went missing yesterday.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.419
Oh, no.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.154
He's ran off twice before,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.756
but he always comes back
after a day or so.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.692
You know, electromagnetic
fields and whatnot.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.696
I'm sorry,
electromagnetic fields?

18:16.729 --> 18:20.767
Yeah, see, cats have, like,
iron in their ears.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.801
Helps them sense the Earth's

18:21.835 --> 18:23.470
electromagnetic fields,
you know.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.473
Helps them sense, uh,
where they're going,

18:26.506 --> 18:27.774
how to get back home.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.544
At least that's what my uncle
used to tell me.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.179
He was a vet
back in North Augusta.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.483
Hold up.
You're from North Augusta?

18:36.516 --> 18:37.717
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:39.185
What part?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.787
Round Belvedere. Why?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.489
I'm a Clearwater girl.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.858
G'on.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.326
What school'd you go to?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.595
Jefferson High. Bulldogs. You?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.129
Pius X.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.231
<i>I knew it.</i>

18:51.264 --> 18:52.465
See, I knew you were fancy

18:52.499 --> 18:54.267
from the first time I saw you.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.302
St. Pius was not fancy.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.271
Lord, have mercy,
if Miss Margie Wills

18:58.304 --> 19:02.809
knew her son was having some
dragon rice with a Pius girl...

19:02.842 --> 19:03.877
hmm.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.519
Hey, listen,
um, a friend of mine

19:12.552 --> 19:16.289
is having a birthday thing
at a bar across town.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.258
Wanna join? Grab a drink?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.228
That depends.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.797
You, um...

19:24.831 --> 19:25.899
you got some room in your bag

19:25.932 --> 19:27.567
for some of this here
mambo sauce?

19:31.604 --> 19:32.906
Mm-hmm.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.813
- Let's see what she learned.
- Yes, sir.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.661
Am I a winter or a spring?

19:54.694 --> 19:55.962
You're an autumn like me.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.465
See, we have, uh,
olive undertones.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.401
- Is that bad?
- Mm.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.269
It's unique.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.204
Boys'll go nuts. Trust me.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.306
Boys think I'm weird.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.607
Boys thought I was weird, too,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.310
until I was 15 at least.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.712
They all went for Lurleen.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.380
You see where that got her,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.951
lurking around the country club
like some haunted radiator.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.687
I thought you
and Lurleen were friends.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.755
Mm. Are you kidding?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.958
That rich-girl Goody Two-shoes,

20:24.991 --> 20:27.393
ugh, she was
my mama's favorite.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.262
I never heard the end of it.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.832
"Darling, why can't you be
more like Lurleen Landry?

20:32.865 --> 20:36.369
"Lurleen Landry knows
her entire chromatic scale

20:36.402 --> 20:38.271
"and two languages.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.572
Isn't she brilliant?"

20:41.841 --> 20:44.344
But Lord knows
she's had a hard time

20:44.377 --> 20:46.579
with that forehead of hers.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.949
Mom! That is so mean.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.456
We used to have a lot more fun,

20:56.489 --> 20:58.658
before Dad went to work
for Uncle Dick.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.695
Oh, come on, now,
nothing's changed.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.965
What if we stayed
in Pine Bluff a little longer?

21:05.999 --> 21:07.934
You could show me more places
from when you were a kid,

21:07.967 --> 21:10.436
and we could go dress shopping.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.038
I don't know.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.607
You don't have to testify.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.443
You could just tell them
that you changed your mind.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.345
Dad said that
that would be fine.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.981
Uh, well, your daddy
says a lot of things.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.752
Are you guys gonna get
a divorce?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.887
No.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.423
Don't be ridiculous.
We're a family.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.958
Then why are you talking
to the papers all the time,

21:31.991 --> 21:33.726
making Dad into a villain?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.796
Can you--can you just stop?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.965
What would be so bad
about that?

21:38.998 --> 21:40.566
And let Nixon
and the whole lot of them

21:40.600 --> 21:41.834
just get away with it?

21:43.569 --> 21:45.905
Kids at school make fun of me
because of you, Mom.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.009
There's reporters
everywhere I go because of you.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.813
You might think
what you're doing is helping...

21:55.915 --> 21:58.051
...but all I want
is for things to go back

21:58.084 --> 21:59.585
to the way they were.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.357
I just want us
to be normal again.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.476
Mitchell.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.611
<i>Hey, sleepyhead.
Did I wake you?</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:27.380
Oh.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.616
I was wondering
when you'd call.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.352
Sorry,
I was occupied with Marty.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.655
<i>You two having
a hootenanny down there?</i>

22:35.688 --> 22:37.890
No, just a real nice time.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.830
You gonna watch the, uh,
festivities tomorrow?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.765
Probably not.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.401
Although Lurleen Landry
did invite us

22:48.434 --> 22:51.771
over to her house
for a John Dean watch party.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.940
Yeah, well,
maybe you should project it

22:53.973 --> 22:55.441
on her forehead.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.546
She was sweet to me today.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.715
It was actually kind of nice
to see her.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.418
Mm, well, maybe you should go
to her little party.

23:05.451 --> 23:07.920
I mean, the whole country's
gonna be watching.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.991
Listen, I was, um...

23:12.024 --> 23:13.993
I was thinking
maybe you're right.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.696
Maybe we could extend
our stay here a little longer.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.466
Wh-what about your testimony?

23:21.467 --> 23:23.770
Well, maybe it can wait.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.009
I miss you.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.611
I miss you too.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.580
<i>Have fun down there.</i>

23:34.614 --> 23:36.783
- Bye-bye, now.
- <i>Bye-bye.</i>

23:43.956 --> 23:45.491
Everything okay?

23:46.993 --> 23:49.061
Yeah.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.706
Excuse me.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.742
Uh, when you said your friend's
birthday was at a bar,

24:02.775 --> 24:06.045
I thought you meant something
more, you know, mellowed out.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.480
Stop.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.982
Everyone's gonna love you.
Don't overthink it.

24:10.016 --> 24:10.983
All right.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.685
<i>Janelle. Janelle!</i>

24:12.718 --> 24:15.154
Oh, hey.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

24:16.556 --> 24:19.458
- Hey!
- Hi!

24:19.492 --> 24:20.927
How's the birthday boy?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.763
Twenty-five and feeling fine,
thank you very much.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.232
Frank, this is Marc and Mary.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.733
They work
on the Watergate Committee.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.136
Guys, this is <i>the</i> Frank.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.905
Oh, Frank. Oh, my--
babe, this is Frank Wills.

24:32.939 --> 24:36.042
He is the security guard
who caught the guys.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.477
Holy shit, man.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.513
You're the guy
who made this all happen.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.249
Yeah, I guess so.
I-in a way.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.986
No, not in <i>a</i> way. In <i>the</i> way.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.554
You got in the way of Nixon

24:48.588 --> 24:50.957
trying to enact
his fascist fucking agenda.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.026
'Cause Nixon's
a fucking fascist!

24:54.060 --> 24:56.796
- Hey, Janelle. Janelle!
- Hey, girl, come over here.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.797
Come on.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.965
- Get over here.
- Come on, y'all.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.670
Ooh! How are you?
Damn, you lovely.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.906
Elijah.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.808
I'd like you to meet
a good friend of mine.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.776
Frank Wills,
this is Elijah Cummings.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.612
It's an honor
to meet you, brother.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.247
Janelle's told me
a lot about you.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.650
Oh, I guess
I'm a popular subject.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.685
This is Tina and Hillary.
They work over on the Hill.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.987
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.555
And I know it's probably
already been expressed to you,

25:22.588 --> 25:24.690
but I would like to thank you.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.259
You done a great good
for this nation.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.596
Oh, um, just doing my job.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.931
Really?
Well, doing your job properly

25:31.964 --> 25:34.800
is plenty heroic
in D.C. these days.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.903
Rest of us stuck
running on campus sit-ins.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.605
Well, hey, now, that is
heroic work too, so...

25:39.639 --> 25:40.873
Yeah, if you'd
show up more often.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.575
- Yeah.
- Whoo! Fair enough, sister.

25:42.608 --> 25:45.811
But this man, this man,

25:45.845 --> 25:47.213
he brought the president
to his knees.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.617
So what are you gonna do
with your new position

25:51.651 --> 25:53.886
in the national consciousness,
brother?

25:54.754 --> 25:57.990
Consciousness? Excuse me?

25:58.758 --> 26:00.826
You got a name now, a platform.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.862
A lot of people
would kill for that chance.

26:04.664 --> 26:07.300
Y-yeah, um...

26:07.333 --> 26:09.769
well, I--
there are a lot of, uh, issues

26:09.802 --> 26:12.605
I'd like to address
in the world currently,

26:12.638 --> 26:14.707
such as...

26:14.740 --> 26:16.609
mostly in some form
of helping other people,

26:16.642 --> 26:21.213
you know, to ensure them
that Frank Wills' name--

26:21.247 --> 26:23.149
I mean, that is my name--
um, to assure them

26:23.182 --> 26:26.919
that Frank Wills' name
is, um, mentioned

26:26.953 --> 26:30.323
not only in the Watergate
but, um, still in history.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.259
And I want to do some type
of form of, you know,

26:33.292 --> 26:35.695
helping humanitarians.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.829
I don't--I don't exactly have

26:36.862 --> 26:38.064
an exact plan
of how to do that,

26:38.097 --> 26:41.267
but yeah, I wanna
do something to help somebody.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.807
Well, uh, I think it's time
for another round.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.009
- You a whiskey man?
- No.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.844
- You sure?
- I'm sure. Thank you.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.312
All right, brother.
I know you want something.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.181
Oh, okay.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.849
<i>Come on over here.</i>

26:56.882 --> 26:57.850
<i>Look at you, coming in here
lookin' sweet</i>

26:57.883 --> 26:58.818
<i>like a peach cobbler.</i>

26:58.851 --> 26:59.952
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

26:59.986 --> 27:02.021
Man to man,
you gonna try for a book deal?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.791
Excuse me,
I gotta use the restroom.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.197
Oh, my God.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.773
Change the country.

27:46.132 --> 27:49.068
Wow. Oh, my God this is...

27:49.101 --> 27:51.704
...this is different.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.373
- How's, uh, prep coming along?
- Ugh.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.675
I'm thinking when
the mob erect the guillotine,

27:56.709 --> 27:58.744
you should probably stand
on the Senate steps

27:58.778 --> 28:01.313
so that I can see you
as my head hits the basket.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.682
Honey.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.753
Look at me.

28:07.787 --> 28:10.756
For the thousandth time,
you're gonna do great.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.092
You really believe that?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.427
I really believe it.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.062
Just gotta get
through this week.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.096
Yeah.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.467
Couldn't do any of this
without you, you know?

28:23.302 --> 28:25.805
You make me better,
you really do.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.873
We make each other better,
you mean.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.942
Right.
That's exactly what I meant.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.844
Right.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.313
So what are we going for?

28:34.346 --> 28:37.049
<i>I guess the yellow
matches the Porsche.</i>

28:37.083 --> 28:39.452
<i>Can you get a baby
in the back of a Porsche?</i>

28:39.485 --> 28:41.020
<i>I guess you didn't want</i>

28:41.053 --> 28:43.456
<i>the baby sleeping under
a "Fuck Communism" sign, eh?</i>

28:43.489 --> 28:44.824
<i>What about my beer cans?</i>

28:44.857 --> 28:46.092
<i>You're putting those back,
right?</i>

28:46.125 --> 28:48.394
<i>You know, baby's gotta learn
to drink.</i>

28:51.030 --> 28:52.731
Something wrong?

28:52.765 --> 28:55.134
What? No. I'm--I just--

28:55.167 --> 28:57.069
yeah, I think I'm just tired.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.038
Okay.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.840
All right.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.513
- You upset about something?
- No, no.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.948
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.282
You sure?
I'm getting a little upsetness.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.451
No, I don't--I'm fine.
I'm happy.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.420
I'm just, um--I'm in a zone.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.088
- I love you.
- <i>Love you.</i>

29:16.122 --> 29:17.356
Don't stay up too late.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.891
Okay.

29:39.812 --> 29:40.946
Fuck.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.184
<i>And now we resume
live coverage</i>

30:18.217 --> 30:20.152
<i>of the Senate Watergate hearings.</i>

30:20.186 --> 30:21.921
<i>Let's go talk to Dan Shore,</i>

30:21.954 --> 30:24.156
<i>who is outside
the committee room. Dan?</i>

30:24.190 --> 30:25.324
<i>Uh, yes, George.</i>

30:25.357 --> 30:26.425
<i>Uh, while you're looking
at John Dean,</i>

30:26.458 --> 30:28.894
I'm holding here
the first 98 pages

30:28.928 --> 30:31.830
of what's expected to be
140 pages of testimony

30:31.864 --> 30:33.532
that Mr. Dean
will be delivering today.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.334
<i>You ask me, John Dean's</i>

30:35.367 --> 30:37.269
<i>a half a gallon
of nothing much.</i>

30:37.303 --> 30:38.571
<i>What's he gonna give a nation</i>

30:38.604 --> 30:40.940
<i>so used
by this administration?</i>

30:40.973 --> 30:43.576
<i>But he do look slick,
I'll give him that.</i>

30:46.612 --> 30:47.947
<i>By his own admission,</i>

30:47.980 --> 30:49.481
<i>Mr. Dean was
a partial coconspirator</i>

30:49.515 --> 30:51.951
<i>in the president's alleged
obstruction of justice.</i>

30:51.984 --> 30:53.619
<i>Dean was fired by Nixon
in April of this year...</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:54.987
<i>- ...after he refused</i>

30:55.020 --> 30:56.455
<i>to publicly absolve
the White House</i>

30:56.488 --> 30:58.023
<i>of any blame in the break-in.</i>

30:58.057 --> 30:59.525
<i>According to sources familiar</i>

30:59.558 --> 31:01.627
<i>with his opening statement,
the former White House counsel</i>

31:01.860 --> 31:04.563
and admitted coconspirator
intends to level

31:04.597 --> 31:07.199
several criminal claims
against President Nixon,

31:07.233 --> 31:10.336
including obstruction
of justice.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.570
Our coverage of
the Watergate hearings

31:11.604 --> 31:14.473
live from Washington
will continue in a moment.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.309
Oh, I'll get it.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.313
Hey, you fall,
I'm not helping you.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.083
Martha!

31:24.116 --> 31:26.385
Oh, my gosh, I didn't know
if you'd make it.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.187
Come on in!

31:28.220 --> 31:30.556
Look at you
in your precious little dress.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.524
She picked it out.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.026
Ma'am.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.294
Hello. Uh, here.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.962
You wanna put that down
over here?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.197
Thank you.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.366
Oh, look at that.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.567
<i>Isn't that darling?</i>

31:41.600 --> 31:43.902
<i>You and your sweet mama.</i>

31:43.936 --> 31:45.170
I wanted you to see that

31:45.204 --> 31:47.606
before I gave it
to the historical society.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.141
You know how she always
wanted to be a part of things.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.910
- Oh, yeah.
- Now she really can be.

31:51.944 --> 31:55.080
Oh, Lurleen, I just, um...

31:55.114 --> 31:57.650
I just wanted to say
thank you for having me here.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.419
It's been real nice
to be back home.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.421
Oh, Martha Beall,

32:02.454 --> 32:05.391
you always have a home
in Pine Bluff.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.260
Come on, you want a drink?
God knows you need a drink.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.074
They're ready for you,
Mr. Dean.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.247
<i>All right.</i>

32:31.016 --> 32:33.352
Time to knock them dead
in there, champ.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.463
Let's go.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.369
I can't.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.638
What's that?

32:52.671 --> 32:55.040
C--I can't.
We-we have to call it off.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.110
<i>We can't call it off.</i>

32:58.143 --> 33:00.112
<i>Y-you're up in five minutes.
Stop fucking around.</i>

33:00.145 --> 33:02.047
I'm not joking. I can't do it!

33:02.081 --> 33:03.382
I can't go up there.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.655
That is perfect.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.390
Two of you wanted to do this
without a lawyer,

33:11.423 --> 33:13.325
and, what,
now you're chickening out?

33:13.359 --> 33:16.328
They will see right through me.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.398
I'm a fraud. Don't you get it?
No one will believe me.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.300
<i>I mean, this is just too--
this is too much.</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:23.035
Hey, this is not
about you anymore.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.636
This is about everything
that we have worked towards,

33:24.670 --> 33:27.306
and you're not going
to fuck this up now, okay?

33:29.141 --> 33:30.542
Here's what we're gonna do.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.011
You're gonna stop whatever
this is, this blubbering,

33:33.045 --> 33:34.079
pull yourself together.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.414
We'll walk
into that room together,

33:35.447 --> 33:37.416
and you'll give your testimony
just like we practiced.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.751
Remember the three things?

33:38.784 --> 33:42.321
No slumping, no fumbling
your words, no excuses.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.291
Do you think this is hard?

33:47.559 --> 33:49.395
Because this is not hard.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.574
Put on your coat, and let's go.

34:40.112 --> 34:43.148
Mr. Dean,
would you raise your hand?

34:43.182 --> 34:45.217
<i>Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:47.486
<i>nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</i>

34:47.519 --> 34:49.221
I do.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.557
<i>You may be seated.</i>

34:51.590 --> 34:53.625
<i>All right, good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

34:53.659 --> 34:56.628
Welcome to the 12th day
of public testimony

34:56.662 --> 34:59.131
for the Watergate subcommittee.

34:59.164 --> 35:02.401
I can't help but notice
that our featured speaker here,

35:02.434 --> 35:06.505
Mr. John Dean, is seated
without counsel present.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.140
Is that a mistake, Sir?

35:08.173 --> 35:10.108
Uh, no, sir, it is not.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.743
My counsel is present
in the room,

35:11.777 --> 35:14.580
but I intend to testify alone.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.183
Son, excuse me for asking,

35:18.217 --> 35:21.286
but why in the hell
would you do that?

35:24.723 --> 35:28.160
Because I intend to tell
the truth, Mr. Chairman.

35:28.193 --> 35:30.329
I do not need a lawyer
to help me with that.

35:32.331 --> 35:36.468
Well, gee, aren't you a keeper
of the gosh-durn flame?

35:38.270 --> 35:39.605
All right,
would you care to read

35:39.638 --> 35:41.707
your prepared statement, son?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.275
Yes, sir. Thank you.

35:44.743 --> 35:48.280
Chairman Ervin,
members of the committee,

35:48.313 --> 35:49.681
I would like to commence

35:49.715 --> 35:51.517
with a general description
of the atmosphere

35:51.550 --> 35:55.387
that existed in the White House
prior to June 1972.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.155
To one who was
in the White House

35:57.189 --> 36:00.225
and became somewhat familiar
with its inner workings,

36:00.259 --> 36:02.528
the Watergate matter
was an inevitable outgrowth

36:02.561 --> 36:04.363
of a climate
of excessive concern

36:04.396 --> 36:05.831
over the political impact

36:05.864 --> 36:09.568
of demonstrators,
excessive concern over leaks,

36:09.601 --> 36:12.404
coupled with a do-it-yourself
White House staff

36:12.437 --> 36:15.240
<i>with no regard for the law.</i>

36:15.274 --> 36:17.643
<i>It was not until I joined
the White House staff</i>

36:17.676 --> 36:19.378
<i>in July of 1970</i>

36:19.411 --> 36:22.180
<i>that I had fully realized
the strong feelings</i>

36:22.214 --> 36:23.715
<i>that the president
and his staff...</i>

36:35.360 --> 36:36.562
I think he's doing great,
don't you?

36:36.595 --> 36:37.529
Yeah.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.664
<i>However, the fact
that many of these elements</i>

36:38.697 --> 36:39.965
<i>culminated with the creation</i>

36:40.198 --> 36:42.334
<i>of a covert
intelligence operation</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:45.537
<i>was not by conscious design--
rather an accident of fate.</i>

36:47.439 --> 36:49.641
Now Mr. Dean, did it worry you

36:49.675 --> 36:52.277
that this Liddy fellow
came up with schemes

36:52.311 --> 36:55.847
involving kidnapping,
prostitution, mugging,

36:55.881 --> 36:57.683
and all the rest of it?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.518
Yes, sir, it did,
and for the record,

36:59.551 --> 37:02.854
I recall Liddy saying that
the girls would be high-class

37:02.888 --> 37:04.456
and the best in the business.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.261
He's so dreamy.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.296
I smoked a cigarette
with him once.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.398
Do kids in D.C. smoke?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.666
If they want to.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.001
<i>Were you surprised
when you heard</i>

37:16.234 --> 37:18.503
<i>about the break-in
on June 17th?</i>

37:18.537 --> 37:20.939
I was more appalled
than surprised.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.909
He's lying.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.844
Seems like he's
telling the truth.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.012
How do you know, Harold?

37:27.245 --> 37:28.580
You've never been to D.C.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.383
I've been to Harrisburg once.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.985
It's all smoke and mirrors,
you see.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.486
Now, Dean, he's a climber.

37:34.519 --> 37:36.655
He's not the best I've
ever seen--that'd be Lyndon--

37:36.688 --> 37:38.790
but he's not the worst either.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.659
You know how D.C. lawyers are.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.295
The only difference
between them and gigolos is,

37:43.328 --> 37:45.797
a gigolo only screws
one person at a time.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.634
Well, you should know.
You're married to one.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.473
Jesus Christ, would you two
quiet down already?

37:56.842 --> 37:58.844
You're just like him.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.880
<i>Get on TV every day
like a fool.</i>

38:03.348 --> 38:04.950
You're bringing down
our president.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.754
Wow, golly,

38:08.787 --> 38:11.623
didn't realize
I was so powerful.

38:11.657 --> 38:14.860
Golly.
You're a Southern girl, huh?

38:14.893 --> 38:17.362
In the South,
we believe in America.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.966
<i>We don't need no cheap
road act coming here</i>

38:20.999 --> 38:25.003
and holding court like
you're some kinda damn queen.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.906
Loudmouth fucking cunt.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.074
Clarence!

38:30.809 --> 38:32.778
Think you've had enough.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.446
It's all right. It's all right.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.815
It's probably best that
Clarence doesn't remember this

38:36.848 --> 38:38.483
in the morning.
Sit down, sit down.

38:38.517 --> 38:41.586
I'm gonna get myself a drink.
I'll get you a fresh one too.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.976
If you were to die,

39:05.010 --> 39:07.345
how would you want it
to happen?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.514
Um, drowning, maybe?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.518
Marty, come here, honey.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.923
We need to get going.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.691
What? But we just got here.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.426
I know, but we're gonna
get an early flight tomorrow,

39:21.460 --> 39:22.794
so I want us to go now.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.896
You-you're still testifying?

39:24.930 --> 39:25.897
Mm-hmm.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.733
Everything all right?

39:27.766 --> 39:28.934
Let's be on our way.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.736
So you made me come down here,

39:30.769 --> 39:32.738
and then once I actually
start to have fun

39:32.771 --> 39:34.372
and have friends for once,
you wanna leave?

39:34.406 --> 39:35.674
Excuse me, Marty,
would you consider

39:35.707 --> 39:36.942
keeping your voice down?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.443
Excuse me, Lurleen.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.045
Do you know
what you should consider?

39:40.078 --> 39:41.379
Bangs.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.150
Why-why can't you just listen
to Dad and let it go?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.819
Why do you have to make
our lives miserable?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.554
You do not know
what you're talking about.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.124
Now, get in the car right now,
without another word.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.772
Uh, all right,
calm down, Marty.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.508
Are you sure
that's what Mommy said?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.443
She's coming home to testify?

40:11.476 --> 40:13.445
<i>I don't wanna go home.
I don't want her to testify.</i>

40:13.478 --> 40:16.148
Okay, well, I'll be here
when you get back tomorrow

40:16.181 --> 40:19.417
and we-we'll talk
about it then, okay?

40:19.451 --> 40:21.119
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Okay, darling.

40:29.995 --> 40:33.832
Diana, get me Senator Gurney.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.503
Thank you
for your testimony, Mr. Dean.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.473
I'm sure we all
appreciate your candor.

40:41.506 --> 40:44.843
<i>All right, the committees
will stand in recess</i>

40:44.876 --> 40:48.747
at the close of business
tomorrow instead of Friday,

40:48.780 --> 40:52.217
until we reconvene again
on Tuesday, July tenth.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.822
Mr. Dean, Mr. Dean.
How do you feel?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.523
Everyone seems to
think you did pretty darn good.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.659
John.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.128
Thank you very much.
Thanks. All right.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.162
Thank you very much. Thank you.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.099
John.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.636
Please.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.139
Thank you.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.007
<i>And so the
committee finishes its work,</i>

41:16.041 --> 41:17.542
<i>and the public
and the Senate committee</i>

41:17.576 --> 41:19.477
<i>will have to judge
between Mr. Dean</i>

41:19.511 --> 41:22.581
<i>and those who contradict him,
the conflicting parties.</i>

41:22.614 --> 41:24.216
For George Herman
and Daniel shore,

41:24.249 --> 41:27.619
this is Nelson Benton,
CBS News, Washington.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.556
And I was so nervous beforehand.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.892
I'm so sorry I freaked out,
you know, but once I--

41:33.925 --> 41:35.794
<i>once I locked in,
man, when I locked in,</i>

41:35.827 --> 41:37.596
<i>I was in the flow.</i>

41:37.629 --> 41:38.930
<i>You see Gurney's face when I--</i>

41:38.964 --> 41:40.565
<i>when I threw
that question back at him?</i>

41:40.599 --> 41:43.001
<i>Oh, my God. It was priceless.</i>

41:43.835 --> 41:47.939
I am gonna fix myself a G&T.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.543
You want one?

41:51.576 --> 41:53.612
Oh, wait, that's right.
I'm sorry.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.779
<i>We should go
to that restaurant</i>

41:54.813 --> 41:55.780
<i>with the singing waiters.</i>

41:55.814 --> 41:56.915
<i>What's it called? Luciano's?</i>

41:56.948 --> 41:58.016
<i>I love that place.</i>

41:59.618 --> 42:00.919
<i>Oh, God, that's good.</i>

42:02.254 --> 42:03.688
Are you sad you can't have
a G&T?

42:03.722 --> 42:06.992
You want me just to fix you
the T or a tea?

42:07.025 --> 42:08.260
I can--I can put the kettle on.

42:08.293 --> 42:10.528
You want it?

42:10.562 --> 42:12.697
It's over. You did it.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.766
Mo.

42:14.799 --> 42:16.167
Moser, what's--

42:18.103 --> 42:20.305
What's going on, hmm?

42:20.538 --> 42:24.009
I'm sorry, the reporters
were mobbing me.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.977
It's not the reporters.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.078
Um...

42:31.016 --> 42:32.317
Okay.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.588
Well, I was sitting there
behind you,

42:36.621 --> 42:39.758
and I just started thinking,

42:39.791 --> 42:42.027
"Oh, gosh,
once Watergate is over

42:42.060 --> 42:45.764
"and your image is salvaged,

42:45.797 --> 42:48.900
where does that leave, um, me?"

42:50.635 --> 42:53.939
Baby, look, if I can
stay out of jail, we can--

42:53.972 --> 42:55.073
we can move past this.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.741
We can get past anything.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.811
Into your future. Yes.

42:59.844 --> 43:01.112
<i>No, come on.</i>

43:03.682 --> 43:06.718
I think I'm just realizing
I can't

43:06.751 --> 43:11.323
just play the dutiful wife
in your story, okay?

43:11.356 --> 43:14.059
Just picking out your clothes
and smiling for the cameras.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.695
I thought I could, but I can't.

43:16.728 --> 43:19.965
I think I'll, um, lose myself.

43:26.705 --> 43:28.273
I just don't--

43:28.306 --> 43:30.942
Um, I lost the...

43:30.976 --> 43:32.344
baby.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.381
What?

43:38.083 --> 43:39.217
When?

43:39.250 --> 43:41.252
Last night and this morning.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.154
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- And it's a long process,

43:43.188 --> 43:45.090
<i>- apparently.</i>
- Oh, my God.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.324
I'd like to be alone.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.105
<i>Frank, are you there?</i>

44:02.707 --> 44:04.175
<i>It's Janelle.</i>

44:04.209 --> 44:06.678
Coming, coming.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.895
I've been calling you all day.

44:25.830 --> 44:26.998
Mind if I come in?

44:27.032 --> 44:28.366
Yeah, come on in.

44:30.035 --> 44:33.338
Ooh, it's, uh, chilly in here.

44:33.371 --> 44:36.241
Yeah, I been leaving
the window open for Tuffy.

44:37.075 --> 44:38.743
What happened to you
last night?

44:38.777 --> 44:40.145
You left, didn't say goodbye.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.414
Yeah, sorry,
I forgot to tell you.

44:47.452 --> 44:49.454
I heard about the Howard job.

44:51.256 --> 44:53.224
What happened?

44:53.258 --> 44:55.427
The man on the phone says

44:55.460 --> 44:59.197
I'm a-a controversial
political figure.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.966
He says I got notoriety.

45:02.901 --> 45:04.302
Ain't that a trip?

45:04.335 --> 45:07.772
I ain't even got no car,
but yet I got notoriety.

45:07.806 --> 45:09.841
It's that damn
university president.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.077
He is a secret Nixon freak.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.711
Janelle, come--

45:13.745 --> 45:16.014
<i>And listen,
I promise we will fight this.</i>

45:16.047 --> 45:17.348
- Stop.
- <i>Okay?</i>

45:17.382 --> 45:18.850
<i>There's plenty
of political groups on campus,</i>

45:18.883 --> 45:20.785
and they will gladly
nail his ass to the ground.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.420
J-Janelle, stop. Please.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.324
I don't wanna fight anymore.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.329
I'm going back to Georgia.

45:31.362 --> 45:32.497
What?

45:32.730 --> 45:33.932
Yeah,
rent's a lot cheaper there,

45:33.965 --> 45:35.166
and my mama's
getting pretty old.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.802
No. No.

45:37.836 --> 45:41.206
Look, listen, I know
it is tough right now,

45:41.239 --> 45:44.075
but you can't just give up.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.077
Give up? Give up on what?

45:46.111 --> 45:47.479
On your friends
looking at me like--

45:47.512 --> 45:49.481
like I'm some kinda dummy?

45:49.514 --> 45:51.850
You're real smart,
you know that?

45:53.118 --> 45:55.086
And smart people like you
got this way of--

45:55.120 --> 45:57.055
of-of-of turning things over
in your head

45:57.088 --> 45:59.791
and-and figuring it all out,
you know?

45:59.824 --> 46:01.993
Figure me out
until even I start to believe

46:02.026 --> 46:03.194
what you think about me.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.463
But come on.

46:06.498 --> 46:09.200
L-look at this place.
Look around.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.871
Look, every morning
since that break-in,

46:12.904 --> 46:15.540
I wake up telling myself
that things are gonna change.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.309
But every morning,
I keep waking up

46:18.343 --> 46:20.478
in this same damn bed

46:20.512 --> 46:22.013
on this same damn block.

46:22.046 --> 46:23.414
We can get you
a better apartment.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.416
See, it ain't about
the apartment, Janelle.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.152
- Okay, okay, look, it's not--
- Just- I can write a--

46:27.185 --> 46:28.987
Write a what?
It's not about the apartment.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.188
Don't you get it?

46:32.190 --> 46:33.391
I don't belong here.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.995
This place...

46:37.028 --> 46:38.196
this place don't want me.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.268
Why would I fight to stay in
a place that doesn't want me?

46:43.301 --> 46:46.304
And that is exactly
how they want you to feel.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.239
They don't want you here.

46:48.273 --> 46:50.842
But that doesn't mean
you don't belong.

46:52.343 --> 46:55.079
Frank Wills, listen to me.

46:55.113 --> 46:57.115
You are a hero.

46:59.384 --> 47:00.852
Oh, yeah?

47:05.456 --> 47:07.358
To who?

48:04.182 --> 48:08.052
Ah, for the love
of steaming fuck.

48:08.086 --> 48:11.522
John fucking Dean.

48:11.556 --> 48:13.458
That slick bastard pulled out

48:13.491 --> 48:16.227
quite a little pirouette
today, didn't he?

48:19.664 --> 48:21.032
Oh, crying out loud.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.236
Hey, uh,

48:25.270 --> 48:27.538
I hear Martha's on deck
for Thursday.

48:27.572 --> 48:28.940
Yeah.

48:28.973 --> 48:30.108
How you feeling about that?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.980
More importantly,
how does the president

48:36.014 --> 48:38.082
feel about it?

48:38.116 --> 48:41.286
Well, he's not exactly
thrilled at the prospect

48:41.319 --> 48:44.522
of watching a bunch of senators

48:44.555 --> 48:47.158
bully a woman
on national television.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.629
What if the cameras
weren't allowed?

48:51.663 --> 48:53.264
Sorry?

48:53.298 --> 48:55.533
What if there were no cameras
in the hearing room?

48:55.566 --> 48:57.535
I mean, that's something
that you could arrange.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.103
Right, Ed?

49:00.238 --> 49:03.708
But if there were
no cameras, then, uh,

49:03.941 --> 49:06.044
well, senators
would have free rein,

49:06.077 --> 49:08.246
and I don't know
that you'd want that.

49:08.279 --> 49:11.115
Martha's, uh--she's pissed off

49:11.149 --> 49:13.451
a lot of people
on that committee.

49:13.484 --> 49:17.488
Yeah.

49:17.522 --> 49:21.025
You know,
when I was in the navy,

49:21.059 --> 49:22.660
I was on a PT boat.

49:22.694 --> 49:24.095
You knew--you knew that.

49:25.430 --> 49:28.733
The only thing
that kept me sane...

49:28.966 --> 49:30.601
was a monkey.

49:33.204 --> 49:36.207
Yeah, a little crab-eating
macaque found in Palau.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.709
<i>Ah.</i>

49:37.742 --> 49:41.979
I named him Pete,

49:42.013 --> 49:44.649
and, uh, I loved him...

49:46.484 --> 49:50.455
...but, uh, he had a bad habit.

49:50.488 --> 49:53.491
He had, uh...

49:53.524 --> 49:55.193
he had a big appetite,

49:55.226 --> 49:58.363
and he'd rummage
in the rations,

49:58.396 --> 50:01.032
and that would drive
my guys mad, of course.

50:01.065 --> 50:04.135
They knew there was not a shit
they could do about it.

50:04.168 --> 50:08.473
But then one day...

50:11.409 --> 50:13.711
...Pete got
into the medic's bag.

50:13.745 --> 50:16.781
The morphine,
the sulfanilamide.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.585
Yeah.

50:20.618 --> 50:22.186
It was bad luck.

50:24.055 --> 50:26.157
Yeah, bad break.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.262
When a monkey cries,

50:31.295 --> 50:34.098
Ed, I'll tell you,

50:34.132 --> 50:36.701
sounds like a child.

50:39.303 --> 50:41.472
Course, it was up to me
to put him down.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.710
But, uh, I couldn't do it.

50:45.743 --> 50:48.379
But one of my boys took my gun
from me, said,

50:48.413 --> 50:50.248
"Lieutenant,

50:50.281 --> 50:53.117
"the problem...

50:53.151 --> 50:54.719
with loving something
too much..."

50:59.157 --> 51:01.626
"...is that you can't do
what needs to be done."

51:05.296 --> 51:08.299
She's not some monkey, John.

51:08.332 --> 51:10.168
She's your wife.

51:45.169 --> 51:46.270
Ed...

51:48.139 --> 51:50.608
...I trust you'll do
what needs to be done.

Alexander Butterfield,

said that President Nixon
ordered secret

electronic listening devices
