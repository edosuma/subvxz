WEBVTT

00:12.979 --> 00:13.880
Yeah.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.157
I'm on my way.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.204
Hey.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.340
Hey.
Sorry to wake you.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.242
No problem.
What's going on?

00:42.342 --> 00:44.010
Three attacks
already tonight.

00:44.077 --> 00:47.113
A dozen killed,
twice that many injured.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.749
None of the attackers
have any history of violence.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.419
Just regular folk
who went berserk.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.621
They found inhalers
at all the scenes.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.957
They're putting
their drug on the street.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.227
First Lady Vic,
now this.

01:01.294 --> 01:02.796
What the hell
does Crane want?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.264
What he's always wanted,

01:04.364 --> 01:05.932
to create chaos
through fear.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.467
Please tell me
this doesn't have

01:07.567 --> 01:09.102
with you and I
working together.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.537
No, it's not.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.907
He was doing this
way before us.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.242
-That's why
Batman put him away.

01:16.309 --> 01:19.079
Then we let him
out again.

01:19.145 --> 01:22.615
We'll put him
back in... together.

01:22.715 --> 01:23.983
From your lips.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.819
I'll call you
from the office.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.067
What the fuck is that?

01:44.471 --> 01:46.172
Did you switch
from weed to acid?

01:48.641 --> 01:50.510
I hope you're
watching the news.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.313
Looks like Gotham
had a real party tonight.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.281
I was wrong
about you, Jason.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.784
I underestimated you.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.020
Good work.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.423
-You're not mad
I stole your stash?

02:03.490 --> 02:05.592
It's all good, man.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.361
With this new machine,
I got plenty.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.030
I thought
you might be pissed.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.333
Anger is just fear
in a little black dress.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.668
Now, my dude,
you can relax.

02:15.768 --> 02:16.970
I'm not the Batman.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.541
Damn. Those attacks
tonight were awesome.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.810
Our partners
don't think so.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.045
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.282
The heads of the Five Families
called an emergency meeting,

02:29.349 --> 02:30.884
said they want
to speak to Red Hood.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.653
That's why I stopped by.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.155
Got to fuel up.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.523
Don't worry.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.790
I'll show them
who's boss.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.639
What did you put in that?

03:12.692 --> 03:16.062
Like I said,
I'm not the Batman.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.013
Come on. Go for a walk

03:34.080 --> 03:35.882
There you go.
Goodbye, babies.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.720
What the fuck
happened to your face?

03:40.787 --> 03:42.188
Town went nuts
last night.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.024
Chick I was with did it.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.894
She got hopped up
on that shit

03:47.961 --> 03:49.762
Wait. That's why
you called this meet?

03:49.862 --> 03:51.264
God damn right.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.866
Look, the Hood
promised business.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.435
Chaos isn't business.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.137
All I've got is
40% loss of income,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.974
a five-way split
on a piece of shit bank job,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.809
and a face full
of metal brads.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.712
And whatever happened
to that truckload of gold?

04:05.778 --> 04:07.146
I took it.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.820
Scarecrow?
What the fuck?

04:13.920 --> 04:14.954
What are you doing here?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.323
Take a wild guess.

04:18.791 --> 04:22.328
Wait.
You're behind Red Hood?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.830
That's right, Valeska.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.964
Call it
a social experiment.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.266
You got a problem
with that?

04:26.332 --> 04:28.668
No, no.
No problem at all, Doctor.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.104
We had no idea
this was your operation.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.939
Guys, relax.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.008
If I was going to gas you,
you'd already be laying

04:35.108 --> 04:38.011
peeling your skin off,
starting with your eyelids.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.782
You remember, right?

04:42.849 --> 04:44.017
Good.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.753
So, why are you here?

04:46.819 --> 04:48.621
I'm here
to reassure you.

04:48.688 --> 04:51.691
Red Hood's chaos
is by design.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.793
Thanks to it,
Batman has left the city,

04:53.860 --> 04:55.194
the Titans are reeling,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.497
and the city is desperate
for a solution,

04:57.597 --> 05:01.367
which means we are ready
for the final phase.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.036
Final phase of what?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.937
The destruction of Gotham?

05:05.004 --> 05:06.272
Because that's
where we're headed.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.341
No, I want
to help Gotham.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.176
I've always wanted
to help Gotham.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.012
That was my plan two years ago,
when the Batman disrupted it.

05:13.112 --> 05:17.116
And now I can finally see
my plans come to fruition.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.052
I've designed
a superior product,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.853
and I've produced
enough of it

05:20.953 --> 05:22.522
to medicate
this entire city,

05:22.622 --> 05:25.024
placing them
under our control.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.893
You call this
under control?

05:26.993 --> 05:31.364
Well, you know,
we've had to tweak

05:31.464 --> 05:35.335
make it a little more happy,
a little less stabby.

05:35.401 --> 05:39.572
Your basic instincts
set free.

05:39.672 --> 05:43.476
Free from restraint,
free from conscience.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.746
That's what
my drug offers, freedom.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.315
And what is
more addictive than that?

05:50.983 --> 05:55.388
So you all
want business,

05:55.488 --> 05:57.757
and I want the distribution
for my product

05:57.857 --> 05:59.425
at a premium price.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.196
The good people of Gotham,

06:03.262 --> 06:05.264
they just want
a feel-good drug.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.836
So we have Red Hood,
who will protect our operation.

06:09.902 --> 06:14.607
And within 24 hours,
you'll all be richer

06:18.544 --> 06:20.380
What do you need?

06:23.416 --> 06:25.885
I'll let you know.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.121
The battle for Gotham
ends tonight.

06:30.189 --> 06:31.023
Be ready.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.631
A dozen dead
in under two hours.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.800
Crane and Red Hood
were only doing a trial run.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.469
Crane is weaponizing anybody
willing to take his drug.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.571
It's turning people
into violent psychopaths.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.207
-That's what
he did with Jason.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.308
He's Red Hood now.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.643
It's time
we all accept what he is.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.145
Now that Crane
has the multiplier,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.813
he's going to start
mass producing this drug.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.883
This was the damage
after three inhalers,

06:56.949 --> 06:59.485
imagine what happens
with 30,000.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.487
Gotham will
tear itself apart.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.989
Did you do scans
on the machine yet?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.490
I tried to trace
the multiplier's

07:04.590 --> 07:06.993
heat and power signatures,
but so far, nothing.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.294
It's like he's hidden it.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.830
-Keep looking.
-Where are you going?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.064
There's another computer.

07:12.131 --> 07:13.733
The GCPD does
this sort of thing.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.834
A bit better hardware.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.502
Why haven't
we been using it?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.005
Because it's illegal.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.608
Well, if we're breaking laws,
I've got an unhappy mobster

07:24.577 --> 07:26.412
Just put it
on the street.

07:26.479 --> 07:27.680
Anybody caught
with the drug is caught

07:27.780 --> 07:29.182
-Got it.
-Thank you, Officer.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.851
-Hey.
-Hey. Any luck?

07:31.951 --> 07:35.188
That SPM machine Crane stole
is part of a city-wide ramp up.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.522
He's in production.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.159
So is that hundreds
or dozens of doses?

07:40.259 --> 07:43.129
Thousands.
On the streets by tonight.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.430
Jesus.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.466
That machine has
a searchable heat signature,

07:46.532 --> 07:48.801
but the Bat Computer
can't see it.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.703
We need something
that can see a little deeper.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.006
No.
Don't even ask.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.942
Oracle's our only hope.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.110
Bruce couldn't stop Scarecrow
until he used Oracle.

07:58.177 --> 08:00.480
And then the NSA
slapped an injunction on us,

08:00.546 --> 08:02.381
and I don't really
feel like going to jail.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.185
They'll never know.

08:06.285 --> 08:07.787
That sounds like something
Bruce would say.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.024
If we don't use it,
more people are gonna die.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.327
You and I both know that.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.462
I promised myself
I wouldn't.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.830
You didn't get rid of it,
did you?

08:18.531 --> 08:19.532
Why not?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.504
Because I imagined
a moment in the future

08:24.570 --> 08:27.807
so terrible
that we might need it.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.543
That moment,
we're here.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.396
Access verified.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.898
Gordon Barbara Gail.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.939
You have company.
Identification requested.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.342
Identified.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.278
Grayson Richard John.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.879
Hello, Dick.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.681
Hello, Oracle.

09:08.748 --> 09:12.251
My condolences
for the loss of Mr. Todd,

09:12.351 --> 09:14.921
and Mr. Wayne's
sudden departure.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.123
I see you've updated
your data systems.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.259
As is my protocol
upon reactivation.

09:20.359 --> 09:23.462
Is there anything I can do
for you, Mr. Grayson?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.032
The two you would like
some time alone?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.535
Commence search,
Dr. Jonathan Crane.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.604
Of course.
One moment.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.308
Public communication,
negative.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.277
Would you like to search
private communications?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.378
No.
-Yes.

09:40.546 --> 09:41.547
Invalid answer.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.151
-Yeah.
-Yes.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.153
Of course.
One moment.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.659
Because I never said that.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.461
Get off my phone.

09:55.561 --> 09:56.829
...kept fucking begging me,

09:56.929 --> 09:59.065
shut the fuck up already!

10:03.736 --> 10:06.739
By tonight. Is it pure?

10:06.806 --> 10:08.808
Yeah, man, it's pure.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.344
Good.
6328 Bollinger Avenue.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.179
I'll be there
in six minutes.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.447
On my way.

10:14.513 --> 10:15.848
Dick, wait.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.250
I'll tell you what I find.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.319
Hey, Conner.
6328 Bollinger Avenue.

10:20.419 --> 10:23.155
Meet me there.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.024
Your heart rate
is elevated.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.826
You seem upset, Barbara.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.028
Would you like
to share your thoughts?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.262
Command, sleep.

10:30.329 --> 10:31.831
Of course.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.184
I pity you, Jason.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.388
You were reckless,

10:57.123 --> 10:59.358
and you were
impatient last night.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.862
And you acted out of fear,
not out of strength.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.332
You see, you're still afraid
of Dick Grayson.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.734
And I failed you.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.204
I failed you
as a teacher.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.873
But here's
today's lesson.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.243
You know
how I broke Batman?

11:19.879 --> 11:24.016
It wasn't with fear,
it was with patience.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.421
I'm going to show you
that you don't need to go

11:28.521 --> 11:31.057
running around Gotham,
trying to destroy the Titans,

11:31.157 --> 11:34.927
you can just
sit back and watch

11:35.027 --> 11:37.563
as the Titans
destroy themselves.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.051
Great idea to track down
this crime boss.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.120
How ever did you
come up with it?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.457
When's Grayson showing up?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.958
He's not.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.793
Dick's parents were murdered
by a Gotham crime family.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.197
-He won't work with mobsters.
-Hmm. Selfish of him.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.932
Some crimes
can't be forgiven.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.967
Oh. But you're
bigger than that.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.369
You're well of forgiveness
is deep.

12:17.436 --> 12:19.472
Here you are with me,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.407
murderer of our parents,

12:21.474 --> 12:23.576
for the good of a city
you don't even like.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.480
You never asked me
why I did it.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.248
I know why.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.318
-Really?
-Yeah. Power.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.587
They had it, you took it.
Simple as that.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.655
I wish it was.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.825
-They left me
with very narrow choices.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.327
You were
forced into it.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.831
Father used to say
that sometimes in life

12:45.931 --> 12:49.401
the right choices
were only a little better

12:49.468 --> 12:51.237
He called it
the 51% rule.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.673
If your choice
was 51% good

12:54.774 --> 12:59.011
and 49% bad,
then you take it.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.748
I hope
you reminded him of that

13:09.355 --> 13:12.358
-I'll do
the talking in there.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.704
-Uh, boss.
-Yeah?

13:29.275 --> 13:30.609
What happened
to your nose?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.347
Valeska Nox.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.449
-My name is--
-Fire-star or something,

13:37.516 --> 13:39.718
Yeah, I've seen you
on television.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.887
Go home.
Fix your face.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.658
Can I offer you ladies
a drink?

13:45.724 --> 13:47.993
Oh, I hope you realize
you're trespassing,

13:48.060 --> 13:49.895
I should call
the authorities,

13:49.995 --> 13:50.996
I feel unsafe.

13:51.730 --> 13:52.832
I'm not your enemy.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.835
Not today.

13:55.901 --> 13:59.538
I hear you're having
second thoughts about

13:59.638 --> 14:00.973
Never heard of either.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.242
Miss Nox,
don't bullshit me.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.581
Partnering
with someone like Crane

14:08.681 --> 14:11.250
From what I hear,
you're smart enough

14:11.350 --> 14:15.588
Tell us where they're hiding,
and we'll make them go away.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.192
But if you can't,
all this comes back on me.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.827
What guarantees
do I have?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.896
Well, Valeska,
life is a risk.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.098
You help us now,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.234
and we owe you
a favor.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.103
You don't help us,

14:31.203 --> 14:36.242
and when we find
Crane and Red Hood anyway,

14:36.342 --> 14:37.409
Believe that.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.778
You don't talk much.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.448
Hmm. Boss' orders.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.450
Here's the deal,

14:44.550 --> 14:47.286
You want to know
about Red Hood and Crane?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.755
They're making
moves tonight.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.926
I can help you stop them,
but I need something first.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.062
Trust is earned.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.065
What do you want?

15:02.067 --> 15:02.935
Recovery.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.974
I need you to bring
something back to me

15:10.576 --> 15:11.810
Something personal.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.127
Crane?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.597
Maybe.
Can you scan it?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.103
It's covered in lead.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.239
All right, knuckle up.
You take the right side.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.917
He knew we were coming.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.290
Oh, shit.

15:59.591 --> 16:00.592
You're gonna be okay.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.494
Defuse it.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.298
-

16:07.266 --> 16:09.635
-Conner?
-It's been modified.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.704
I can't defuse it.
Dick, you have to go.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.305
-What?

16:14.206 --> 16:15.708
There's no time.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.676
-What are you talking about?
-Dick, there's no time!

16:33.158 --> 16:34.626
That van was a trap.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.228
Who gave you
this address?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.330
Someone I should have known
better than to trust.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.135
Hey. What happened?

16:43.202 --> 16:45.537
Crane is in Oracle.
He tried to kill us.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.806
-It was a setup.
-That's impossible.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.012
Hello, Commissioner.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.214
I don't know
how he got in,

16:55.314 --> 16:57.383
-We can use this.
-Use?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.418
Dick,
you could have died.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.720
Yeah, but I didn't.
We can talk about it

17:01.820 --> 17:03.856
I'm on my way.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.335
Goddamn.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.772
Gordon's pretty
when she's scared.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.540
She knows
we're in there.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.244
Well, duh.
It's not what they know,

17:25.344 --> 17:28.380
How predictable
are the righteous.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.517
Oracle.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.053
Yes, Commissioner Gordon.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.754
How do I destroy you?

17:37.523 --> 17:40.626
Check and mate.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.630
Even the Batman
needed the Oracle

17:44.730 --> 17:48.200
They had one weapon
and now...

17:50.436 --> 17:52.104
You made them destroy it.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.142
You're learning.

18:05.551 --> 18:06.718
Mr. Nox?

18:06.785 --> 18:08.387
Sorry,
you got the wrong guy.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.089
I don't think
we do, Michael.

18:14.159 --> 18:15.227
Whoa.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.328
You're Starfire.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.596
Your mother sent us.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.731
My mother?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.334
What, she's hiring
superheroes now?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.669
No,
she's not hiring us,

18:23.769 --> 18:24.970
she's helping us.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.106
Part of the deal
is bringing you back home.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.408
Not a chance.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.676
No, I'm done with her.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.312
Parents are such a burden,
aren't they?

18:33.412 --> 18:34.980
She wants to protect you.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.282
You see what's happening
in Gotham.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.518
I know she's no saint,
but she's your mother.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.086
There's no running away
from that.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.290
Look, we are our family,

18:45.357 --> 18:47.626
even if we don't
want to be.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.361
This is fucking crazy.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.196
Look, no matter
what she is,

18:51.296 --> 18:53.532
you're safer with her
than you are here.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.369
Things are gonna get
real nasty in Gotham,

18:57.469 --> 18:59.138
And I don't think
your friends here

18:59.204 --> 19:00.706
are going to be able
to protect you

19:00.806 --> 19:03.442
I left for a reason, okay?

19:03.509 --> 19:06.612
You don't know her.
You don't know

19:09.314 --> 19:10.449
who she is.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.384
Then don't be.
Be better than her.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.787
Help me save Gotham.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.024
I'm not gonna force you
to come with us,

19:19.124 --> 19:20.659
but I am asking you...

19:22.494 --> 19:23.395
Please.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.712
Come on, Jason,
how do I find you?

19:40.812 --> 19:43.248
Yeah, butthead, figure me out.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.220
Could've at least

19:48.320 --> 19:51.657
Sorry I didn't cram it full of
pinball machines and cat food.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.762
What were you hiding?

19:58.497 --> 20:00.566
Get out of my stash, narc.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.269
Narc.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.388
Would you look at that.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.226
Juvie 101:

20:27.292 --> 20:28.627
Always have two stashes

20:28.727 --> 20:30.963
just in case
one gets compromised.

20:36.535 --> 20:37.402
Gotcha.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
It's completely inaccessible?

20:43.141 --> 20:44.543
Yeah.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.812
To us and to Crane.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.213
He hacked the system.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.250
He knew that we knew.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.818
So, I decided that any attempt

20:52.918 --> 20:54.820
to manipulate the situation
would be pointless.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.888
We could have manipulated Crane
using Oracle.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.390
It was right there
in front of us.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.159
You had it destroyed. Why?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.762
He tried to kill you.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.331
I was afraid that he might
actually be successful

21:06.431 --> 21:08.800
I don't need you
to protect me, okay?

21:08.900 --> 21:09.968
Be stronger than that.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.337
Excuse me.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.840
Your fear of this machine
cost us the one lead we had.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.308
If you can't keep
your emotions in check,

21:16.408 --> 21:17.442
then you can't help me.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.911
Why are you
pushing me away?

21:19.978 --> 21:21.313
Because you're
getting in the way.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.651
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

21:25.751 --> 21:26.585
Forget it.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.523
Look, if you want
to do this like Bruce,

21:31.623 --> 21:34.526
fine. But you're
not doing it alone.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.329
Crane isn't smarter
than both of us combined.

21:37.429 --> 21:38.697
So, we go analog.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.365
We think.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.502
Unless you want
to be emotional about it.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.819
Any ID on the guy in the van?

22:00.886 --> 22:04.022
DNA came up clean.
He's not in the system.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.457
License plate's clean, too.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.793
Crane doesn't
kill randomly.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.361
He needed the victim
for something.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.198
He has the multiplier.
He has the drug.

22:13.298 --> 22:14.533
What else does he need?

22:17.302 --> 22:18.170
Power.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.672
He'll need
to pull a huge amount

22:20.739 --> 22:22.074
to run the machine, right?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.042
And he'll need someone
to help him hide it.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.582
Missing person's report
filed yesterday

22:30.682 --> 22:34.152
by a woman married to a foreman
at Gotham Electric.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.324
That's it. That's him.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.727
That's the guy from Van.
Dennis Feeg.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.263
Vee, I need you
to run a name for me.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.013
I thought I was clear
about what I needed.

23:11.890 --> 23:12.891
Michael.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.438
I only came because Starfire--

23:31.977 --> 23:33.111
What a surprise.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.384
He was working for the FBI.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.623
Became a liability.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.958
I didn't have a choice.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.661
I promised him
he would be safe.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.971
Never make promises
you can't keep.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.109
Speaking of which,

24:04.176 --> 24:05.944
you did your part.
I'll do mine.

24:07.479 --> 24:09.347
I'll tell you
what I know about Crane.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.121
I like to shake on my deals.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.493
Fair enough, Titan.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.496
I'm not only a Titan.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.265
I'm a Queen.

24:58.997 --> 25:00.232
Don't.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.068
-Don't what?
-Don't say, "I told you so."

25:03.168 --> 25:04.569
I know
we needed Valeska's intel.

25:04.669 --> 25:05.971
I know I screwed up.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.672
Koriand'r, you were right
to do what you did.

25:08.907 --> 25:11.243
That rage you feel right now?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.678
I felt that the day
I killed our parents.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.482
Perhaps now is the time
to tell you why.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.686
After you stopped Trigon,
you didn't come back home.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.191
You cut off communication
and stayed on Earth.

25:27.726 --> 25:29.861
The people
of Tamaran were angry.

25:29.928 --> 25:33.064
Why was their beloved Starfire
not returning to rule?

25:33.164 --> 25:34.165
So they blamed me.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.668
The cursed child.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.170
I must have driven you away

25:39.237 --> 25:41.773
so that I
can take the throne for myself.

25:41.873 --> 25:42.841
There were riots.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.243
Calls for my head.

25:47.345 --> 25:49.414
They thought
that by killing me,

25:49.514 --> 25:50.949
it would bring you back.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.019
And mother and father,

25:54.085 --> 25:56.121
they saw a way
to restore peace...

25:57.889 --> 25:59.391
and maintain power.

26:00.258 --> 26:01.293
All they had to do was

26:01.393 --> 26:03.128
sacrifice their
lesser daughter.

26:03.228 --> 26:07.065
They decided that 51%
was good enough for them, too.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.303
I had no choice, Koriand'r.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.373
Because they never gave me one.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.411
Why did you come to Earth?

26:20.912 --> 26:22.714
I thought that if I
took the throne,

26:22.781 --> 26:24.316
it would help me unify Tamaran.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.553
But Tamaran hates me.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.222
I came to Earth to convince you
to rule by my side...

26:33.058 --> 26:35.226
even though I knew
you would never forgive me.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.931
I'm not even sure you
believe me now.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.301
But it's the truth.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.474
So Bogey pooped twice,
but Evie,

26:49.574 --> 26:51.676
she must've
eaten cheese or something,

26:56.781 --> 26:58.650
This place has access
to the main power grid?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.418
-That's what Vee says.
-

27:00.485 --> 27:02.520
Why do I get the feeling
Vee's never wrong?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.322
'Cause she's not.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.098
Looks like Dennis' co-worker

27:13.164 --> 27:14.933
wasn't on board
with Crane's plan.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.704
Matthew Fasano.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.873
This says he's
the sub-station's manager.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.475
Are the distribution
logs there?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.211
Got 'em.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.947
Look for any small
percentage changes in the grid.

27:29.014 --> 27:30.849
Things that normally wouldn't
flag the system.

27:31.683 --> 27:32.651
Right here.

27:32.717 --> 27:36.221
Got 1% off of 50 sub-stations.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.056
Barely noticeable
on its own.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.125
Yet an enormous amount
of power overall.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.292
That's why
Conner couldn't find

27:41.359 --> 27:42.627
the multiplier's
power signature.

27:42.694 --> 27:43.995
Crane was hiding it.

27:44.062 --> 27:45.330
Where's it going?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.298
Conroy District.

27:47.365 --> 27:49.367
There. But I can
only narrow it down

27:49.467 --> 27:52.337
to a 20-block radius.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.506
-We'll have
to check every building.

27:56.141 --> 27:56.975
Wait.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.376
What?

27:59.210 --> 28:00.345
We have a new problem.

28:04.149 --> 28:05.350
Talk to me.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.751
We tracked Crane
in the Conroy District,

28:06.851 --> 28:08.253
but we don't know
what building.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.188
His machine goes hot
in less than an hour.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.424
I already know.
I was about to call Barbara.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.359
Look, mob contact,
Valeska Knox,

28:14.426 --> 28:16.661
she gave Crane supplies
in the Red Hood deal.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.063
You made a deal with the mob?

28:18.163 --> 28:20.098
A deal would be
overstating it.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.099
Look, this Valeska woman,

28:21.199 --> 28:23.234
she sent Crane a shipment of--

28:24.002 --> 28:25.336
What was it again?

28:25.403 --> 28:27.238
Freon.
-Louder.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.374
-Freon.
-Thank you.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.709
Does that help
narrow it down?

28:30.775 --> 28:31.943
Freon.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.378
Air-conditioning coolant.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.380
Victor.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.348
-Victor who?
-  Victor Freeze.

28:37.415 --> 28:39.050
I know exactly where Crane is.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.028
I just talked to Dick.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.262
Team's gotta head out.

28:51.362 --> 28:52.230
Just wanted to...

28:53.631 --> 28:54.632
check in on you.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.636
Oh. Don't worry.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.473
It's just that stuff you squirt
on everything you eat.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.475
That's not ketchup.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.311
What? You have molecular vision
or some shit?

29:06.411 --> 29:09.647
No, but I can see,
that's not Ketchup.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.052
You okay?

29:14.119 --> 29:15.487
I'm fine.

29:17.622 --> 29:18.623
Time to go.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.560
You guys have fun without me.

29:22.627 --> 29:23.895
Not so fast.

29:26.464 --> 29:27.966
I wasn't there for you...

29:28.967 --> 29:30.435
when you needed me most.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.304
I'm sorry.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.840
Well, too late
to change the past.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.408
Yeah.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.444
But not the present.

29:43.581 --> 29:45.150
Really?

29:45.250 --> 29:47.986
Our parents never
really gave you a chance.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.187
Maybe I should.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.593
What are those?

29:55.660 --> 29:57.862
A bit of
Tamaranean technology.

30:39.537 --> 30:41.206
You, uh...

30:41.306 --> 30:42.807
You look good.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.269
Wakey-wakey.

31:11.936 --> 31:12.837
Hey.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.243
You're about to see
what winning feels like.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.384
This is
what we've been waiting for.

31:26.451 --> 31:28.786
If Crane can
get the whole city hooked

31:28.887 --> 31:30.622
and we have the product,

31:30.722 --> 31:31.789
it's a new day.

31:33.091 --> 31:35.627
I'll believe it when I see it.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.295
You don't have
to piss yourself.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.198
Didn't you hear?
The Bat left Gotham.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.707
-He's here.
-What?

31:52.143 --> 31:53.711
This way.
I heard something.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.582
What the--

31:58.983 --> 31:59.984
Over here, fellas.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.590
-Shoot 'em.
-

32:05.657 --> 32:06.624
No.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.826
No.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.975
-

32:37.655 --> 32:38.923
You thinking what I'm thinking?

32:39.657 --> 32:41.859
Yep. Stand back.

32:47.665 --> 32:50.368
No, no, no.
No, this is all wrong.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.805
No. No!

32:55.840 --> 32:56.808
Huh?

33:11.622 --> 33:12.690
It's all over.

33:17.061 --> 33:17.996
Not yet.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.002
We got her!
Light her up!

33:43.054 --> 33:46.190
Okay. I see
how Earth can be fun.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.109
Not bad.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.711
You're not so bad yourself.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.080
Let's see.

34:09.180 --> 34:13.418
X-ray vision,
super-hearing, super-strength.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.354
I'm wondering
what other skills you have.

34:16.421 --> 34:17.722
I'd love to show you sometime.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.294
All clear.

34:23.394 --> 34:25.129
Let's check the exits.
They're on the move.

34:30.701 --> 34:31.569
Don't worry.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.371
We'll find Jason.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.049
Have no fear, my boy.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.051
I'll get 'em back.

34:48.453 --> 34:49.620
I always get 'em back.

35:03.468 --> 35:04.802
-One more?
- Um...

35:04.902 --> 35:07.405
I think one's my limit.
Thanks, though.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.507
Okay.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.009
Three hundred thousand
nebulizers destroyed tonight.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.344
His whole operation.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.180
And dozens
of Gotham's mobsters in jail.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.250
And a few in the hospital,
thanks to Krypto.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.751
Not a bad night.

35:20.818 --> 35:23.020
It will be better when we
bring down Crane and Jason.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.123
They're on the run now.
They're getting sloppy.

35:25.189 --> 35:26.190
That's when we win.

35:27.425 --> 35:28.993
But good work. Cheers.

35:29.093 --> 35:29.961
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

35:30.027 --> 35:31.195
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

35:33.164 --> 35:34.365
Congratulations.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.933
I'm gonna hit the road.

35:37.034 --> 35:38.769
Back at it tomorrow.

35:38.836 --> 35:39.871
I'll see you out.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.140
Um, I know the way.
It's okay.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.443
You kids have fun.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.145
-Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.980
Goodnight.

35:49.046 --> 35:50.281
This might sound insane,

35:50.348 --> 35:52.183
but I am dying
for some ice cream.

35:52.283 --> 35:56.454
Did anyone think to grab some
when we were at Snowy Cones?

35:56.521 --> 35:57.388
Mm.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.523
Maybe DoorDash.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.224
Couple gallons
of Rocky Road?

36:00.324 --> 36:01.526
I can beat DoorDash.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.164
Thanks, Conner.

36:07.231 --> 36:08.866
You know what?
Save me some.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.845
I thought you said
you were leaving.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.681
I thought I was.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.996
The other night at my place,

36:39.063 --> 36:40.064
when you left...

36:43.501 --> 36:45.069
you didn't want to leave,
did you?

36:58.449 --> 36:59.283
Um...

37:00.851 --> 37:01.953
'Cause I didn't want you to.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.022
You're gonna give me
a chance to answer?

37:05.089 --> 37:06.390
Sorry.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.944
Guess I'll take
that second beer now.

37:27.044 --> 37:28.579
The beers might have
to wait a minute.

37:56.807 --> 37:57.908
- It's 3:00 am.

37:57.975 --> 37:59.744
Who the fuck are you?

37:59.810 --> 38:02.680
Hi. Um, Molly?

38:02.780 --> 38:04.649
I'm Gar Logan.

38:04.749 --> 38:07.418
You might know me
from the Titans.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.154
Uh, you wrote this letter
to Jason Todd

38:10.254 --> 38:11.689
saying you wanted
to help him.

38:13.024 --> 38:13.958
So do I.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.982
Understand me now

38:40.618 --> 38:44.855
That I'm mad

38:46.791 --> 38:51.462
Can always be an angel?

38:53.497 --> 38:58.402
You see some bad

38:58.502 --> 39:05.509
Whose intentions are good

39:05.576 --> 39:12.750
Let me be misunderstood

39:16.654 --> 39:22.393
I'm so carefree

39:22.493 --> 39:27.698
That's hard to hide

39:30.534 --> 39:35.039
Is worry

39:35.106 --> 39:40.544
To see my other side

39:40.611 --> 39:47.551
Whose intentions are good

39:47.618 --> 39:55.292
Let me be misunderstood
