Uh, see you there.

Uh, she doesn't
say much, does she?

No, but there's something
I like about her.

25:49.054 --> 25:51.254
OLIVER:
Dude, is it true?

25:51.256 --> 25:53.856
- Is what true?
- That you stepped out

25:53.858 --> 25:57.227
of your comic book
art-studio man cave

25:57.229 --> 26:00.630

to a real-life girl?

- She... She's just a friend.
- Just a friend?

26:03.268 --> 26:07.504

Friend good. Alone bad.

26:09.207 --> 26:12.775
Dude, this is so cool. You're
almost becoming sort of normal.

26:12.777 --> 26:14.576

- Is she cute?
- Yeah, I guess.

She's a girl,

- bro, not a fantasy.
- DAN: Okay.

26:23.521 --> 26:25.054

- Painting?

26:25.056 --> 26:26.221
Hey, that's pretty cool.

26:26.223 --> 26:28.725
So this girlfriend of yours...

26:28.727 --> 26:30.959
She's not my girlfriend.

26:30.961 --> 26:34.963
She's just a friend
who happens to be a girl.

26:34.965 --> 26:38.200
A friend who's a girl.

26:38.202 --> 26:39.736
I guess that could work.

26:39.738 --> 26:42.005
- What's with the interrogation?
- Dude, in case

26:42.007 --> 26:43.773
you didn't know,
in this group,

26:43.775 --> 26:45.741
when someone gets a girlfriend,
it's headline news.

- Where's she from?

that's pretty intense.

26:55.287 --> 26:59.154
I just met her. She probably
doesn't even like me.

[CHUCKLING] Well when she meets us,
she'll like you.

I don't know how I am gonna
tell you this, but, umm...

27:21.046 --> 27:24.680
I wanna try out
for the Olympic Team.

The Olympic team?

27:27.285 --> 27:29.751
That's next year.

27:29.753 --> 27:33.256
Yes, but I also wanna try out
for the U.S. national team

27:33.258 --> 27:36.025
and hopefully compete in
the World Championships

27:36.027 --> 27:39.932
- in the fall.
- Mm-hm, that's in a few months.

27:42.067 --> 27:43.935
That means you'll be
leaving our team.

Yes.

[CHUCKLES]
That's a big one.

27:54.878 --> 27:57.246
I've been dreaming of it
since I was 5 years old.

27:57.248 --> 28:00.650
It's every gymnast's dream.

28:00.652 --> 28:02.619
- Ha.
- Yup. I know.

28:02.621 --> 28:03.987
I assume that you've

28:03.989 --> 28:06.055
discussed it
with your parents.

28:06.057 --> 28:09.625
- What are... What do they think?
- Well, you know my parents.

28:09.627 --> 28:11.193
They just want
what's best for me,

28:11.195 --> 28:12.961
and they said
it's my decision.

28:12.963 --> 28:14.396
But I won't do it

28:14.398 --> 28:16.632
without your blessing.

28:16.634 --> 28:18.934
Coach, I...

28:18.936 --> 28:21.738
I know that I would be
abandoning the team,

28:21.740 --> 28:25.775
and that it's kind of
selfish of me.

28:25.777 --> 28:28.010
But I really,
really want this.

28:28.012 --> 28:32.414
And if I don't do it now,
I'll age out.

28:32.416 --> 28:34.150
This is my only chance.

28:34.152 --> 28:37.219
Brenna,
I totally get it.

28:37.221 --> 28:41.391
Now, you realize you may have
to give up your scholarship.

28:41.393 --> 28:43.426
Yes, coach.

28:43.428 --> 28:47.063
And what if you
don't qualify?

28:47.065 --> 28:50.932
Well, I've thought about that
a lot, actually.

28:50.934 --> 28:54.269
But I feel really solid
about my training.

28:54.271 --> 28:55.773
And I want to take
the chance.

28:57.741 --> 29:00.075
I realize that this is
a hard decision for you.

29:00.077 --> 29:03.880
So just please
think about it.

29:03.882 --> 29:06.048
No. There is nothing
to think about.

29:06.050 --> 29:10.786
This is not my decision,
Brenna. It's yours.

29:10.788 --> 29:14.923
You've been training for
this moment your entire life,

29:14.925 --> 29:17.959
and if you don't
take this chance now,

29:17.961 --> 29:21.330
you will always regret it.

29:21.332 --> 29:24.333
This is your time, Brenna.
This is your moment.

29:24.335 --> 29:27.170
And yes,
the team will miss you a lot.

29:27.172 --> 29:30.172
And you will leave a big hole
in my starting lineup.

29:30.174 --> 29:32.240
But we'll figure it out.

29:32.242 --> 29:36.078
If anybody can do this,
Brenna, it's you.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.817
And I am really proud of you.

what I told you last week

30:35.339 --> 30:37.539
about shoulders squeezing
the ears, hands are

30:37.541 --> 30:40.276
pressed firmly into the ground,
hips are flat.

- Hey, Natalie.
- Hey, hi.

- How ya doing?
- Hey, girls you all

- Hi, ladies.

- GIRLS: Hi.
- Hello.

30:47.417 --> 30:48.950
Do you mind if we help?

30:48.952 --> 30:50.920
- Please.
- Well, ladies,

30:50.922 --> 30:53.389
the secret to
a great handstand

30:53.391 --> 30:56.926
is not only balance.
It is confidence

30:56.928 --> 30:59.828
and a lot of repetitions.
The more you repeat,

30:59.830 --> 31:02.131
the more confident you get.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.900
Does it make sense?

31:03.902 --> 31:07.135
- ALL: Yes, Miss Nadia.
- But what if I keep on falling?

31:07.137 --> 31:10.006
Then you get right back up
and do it over and over again.

31:10.008 --> 31:11.974
Pretty soon,
it will just feel natural.

31:11.976 --> 31:13.942

a long time.

she is in that handstand.

31:19.884 --> 31:22.384
She could hold that
all day long.

31:22.386 --> 31:25.287
It took her a long time
to get to this form.

makes you confident.

And without their key player,
Brenna Dowell.

01:15:10.212 --> 01:15:12.912
That's exactly right.
Brenna Dowell took the year off

01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:15.816

01:15:15.818 --> 01:15:17.784

the World Championship Team

is the Olympic trials.

01:15:20.221 --> 01:15:22.722
At the World Championships,
she competed a skill

01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:25.592
that no one has done before,
a piked double front.

01:15:25.594 --> 01:15:28.461
She is the very first athlete
to ever compete that skill.

Bart, can you still
do a handstand?

01:27:03.158 --> 01:27:04.426
Yeah, of course.

01:27:06.761 --> 01:27:08.260
Give me a score?

01:27:08.262 --> 01:27:09.461
A nine.

01:27:09.463 --> 01:27:10.929
Ugh, let's see yours.

Of course, it's a 10.

01:27:18.439 --> 01:27:21.273
It's Nadia Comaneci.

01:27:21.275 --> 01:27:22.644
We still got it.

01:27:45.432 --> 01:27:46.898
You mentioned you had
a chance

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.366
to catch up
with Coach Kindler.

01:27:48.368 --> 01:27:49.735
What is she like?

01:27:49.737 --> 01:27:51.437
What an amazing woman.

01:27:51.439 --> 01:27:52.938
That's all I have to say.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.977
She is so creative,
so on her game.

01:27:57.979 --> 01:28:00.278
I would love
to be like her someday.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.880
I have heard
she is a great coach,

01:28:01.882 --> 01:28:03.816
but not a very
good sportscaster.

01:28:03.818 --> 01:28:05.750
I personally think
she can do anything

01:28:05.752 --> 01:28:07.421
she sets her mind to.
