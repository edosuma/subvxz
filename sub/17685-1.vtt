<i>- and a big good morning
to you all, this is Kansas</i>

01:41.930 --> 01:44.520
<i>city's morning news with Bill
Thomas and Michael Petrenally</i>

01:44.635 --> 01:50.949
<i>here on 94.2 KTCV. Your FM
station in greater Kansas City.</i>

01:50.974 --> 01:52.506
<i>I'm Anthony...</i>

01:55.339 --> 01:56.678
-Mom!

01:56.758 --> 01:58.635
- Evan!
- Mom!

02:00.791 --> 02:03.845
Oh, really?
- No, don't kill it! Don't kill it.

02:03.926 --> 02:05.845
- Ok...
- Just don't.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.298
These things are terrifying
but I can't kill them.

02:08.767 --> 02:11.514
- You're still freaking about it.
It's fine.

02:12.759 --> 02:15.355
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK, mom.

02:22.194 --> 02:23.261
-Thanks sweetie.

02:39.049 --> 02:41.287
Evan, do you remember
what we talked about

02:41.312 --> 02:44.226
last night? About getting
registered in time?

02:44.349 --> 02:45.098
-Yeah...

02:45.123 --> 02:46.760
- I don't want to have
another drama with your dad.

02:46.784 --> 02:49.153
- You are the one who woke me
up with that crazy screaming.

02:49.727 --> 02:52.777
- You may recall that I had a few thoughts
about you getting asleep last night.

02:52.801 --> 02:54.172
- I told you I was
doing homework!

02:54.231 --> 02:56.542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Stop!

02:56.567 --> 03:01.113
- Homework? You were on Facebook for like
three hours. Come on, sweetie, we gotta go.

03:05.492 --> 03:06.835
<i>- Are you ready?</i>

03:06.860 --> 03:10.889
- Are you kidding? Of course I'm ready.
Are you ready?

03:10.914 --> 03:12.268
That's what I want to know.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.924
<i>- I was born ready. There's
nothing that scares me.</i>

03:14.948 --> 03:16.210
<i>You're the chicken.</i>

03:16.428 --> 03:19.640
- Ah, Once we've done it you won't
believe how great we'll feel.

03:20.215 --> 03:22.720
It will redefine us.
- I need that.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.574
- Any time we start to think
"Can I really do this?"

03:26.096 --> 03:27.835
The answer I'll always
tell is "Hell, yeah."

03:27.860 --> 03:28.415
Hell yeah.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.168
- I went skydiving. Jumped a little
fucking plane. I'm capable of anything.

03:34.216 --> 03:39.175
<i>- I can tell. This is what you need.</i>
- Yeah, Oh, yeah.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.915
<i>- The environmental devastation
we are suffering now,</i>

03:41.940 --> 03:44.439
<i>the damage to the water
supplies and the food...</i>

03:44.683 --> 03:46.822
I was going to make you eggs.

03:46.823 --> 03:48.079
<i>- that was strategic...</i>

03:48.104 --> 03:49.885
- I don't like eggs.
<i>- All of us...</i>

03:50.788 --> 03:53.847
You can't eat the same thing
every morning. -Why not?

03:53.872 --> 03:57.214
Stop. I'm gonna make the eggs
and you're gonna eat them.

03:58.226 --> 03:59.717
I love you and I want you healthy.

04:01.191 --> 04:07.155
- You should call dad about that.
- I can handle a simple lighting job.

04:12.351 --> 04:15.562
- What are you looking for?
- My Exacto.

04:18.824 --> 04:21.111
Strip off the ends of the wires.

04:21.356 --> 04:23.979
Get a clean connection, problem solved.

04:24.449 --> 04:27.816
I don't need your dad for that.
- Just call an electrician anyways.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.214
- At least he doesn't need
to sweat about money.

04:30.377 --> 04:33.644
- Hey mom, I need help,
in another assignment

04:33.669 --> 04:36.258
besides the math
stuff, by the way.

04:36.289 --> 04:37.915
-Sure, which one, hon?

04:38.877 --> 04:42.339
- The one about that family tree.
- Well, I thought we did that one already.

04:42.423 --> 04:45.676
- We did your side of the family.
- So talk to your dad.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.792
-Could you... call him for me?

04:50.055 --> 04:52.380
Uh....what is the point
of the assignment anyway?

04:52.405 --> 04:56.252
- Miss Delgado says everybody should know
where they came from and who we are.

04:56.311 --> 05:00.172
- I hate doing your homework.
- Come on, mom, you know dad.

05:01.664 --> 05:03.464
He doesn't like helping me.

05:05.863 --> 05:10.428
I'll do three more math problems
right now, if you call him for me.

05:10.747 --> 05:13.245
- Hmm... four?
- Three.

05:14.631 --> 05:15.631
-Four.

05:56.121 --> 05:59.833
God damn it! Fucking homework!

06:01.168 --> 06:02.973
I hate that shit.

06:09.718 --> 06:14.245
- Hey champ, forget about the math.
We need to go. I'll wait in the car.

06:20.771 --> 06:25.105
Are you seriously texting me from upstairs?
- Mommy!

06:25.129 --> 06:27.129
Mommy!

07:00.519 --> 07:03.298
- Renee, I got the tickets.
The flight's ready.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.290
Don't be too scared.
See you soon, sweetie.

07:07.484 --> 07:10.398
- Who was that?
- Margaret work.

07:10.789 --> 07:12.789
<i>-To erase message, press nine.</i>

07:12.823 --> 07:16.236
- Scared of what? Where are you going?
- I'm going skydiving today.

07:16.905 --> 07:20.999
- What? You didn't tell me that.
What if something happens?

07:21.373 --> 07:24.382
- It will be insanely fun.
I'll be fine, baby.

07:24.422 --> 07:27.587
<i>- Next message.
- Hey, Renee. You're not calling me back?</i>

07:27.725 --> 07:31.063
<i>I thought we had a great time. Give
me a call when you have a chance.</i>

07:31.730 --> 07:32.978
- Was that Adam?
- Alan, yeah.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.461
- Do you like him?
- None of your business.

07:40.337 --> 07:41.337
<i>-Next message.</i>

07:41.685 --> 07:44.480
<i>- Don't take him to school Friday.
I'm going to start the weekend</i>

07:44.505 --> 07:47.215
<i>short so don't fucking drag us down with
your nonsense. Alright?</i>

07:47.274 --> 07:48.379
-Was that dad?

07:48.404 --> 07:52.394
- He is not always as nice
to me as he is to you, baby.

07:55.157 --> 07:56.618
It's okay.

08:25.437 --> 08:28.844
- Pick him up 5 PM, because
I've got a date Tuesday night.

08:29.316 --> 08:33.154
- Listen, Cliff, you'll should
know he heard you cursing at me.

08:33.534 --> 08:36.885
- Whoa, when was that?
- On my voice mail.

08:36.909 --> 08:39.510
- Well, that's your fault for letting
him listen to your messages.

08:39.702 --> 08:43.371
I mean, come on, you play them in
your car, right in front of him.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.987
He's doing that thing
again with his homework.

08:48.012 --> 08:51.154
- He just... He needs to focus.
You know what his tutor said.

08:51.213 --> 08:56.135
- Well, maybe he needs a better tutor.
- So you want to spend more?

08:58.429 --> 09:02.430
It's the way he reacts when
he can't solve a problem.

09:02.455 --> 09:03.984
-He's good in school.

09:05.221 --> 09:06.221
He's good in school.

09:08.522 --> 09:10.736
If you could just help
him a little bit more...

09:10.761 --> 09:13.485
- I'll try. Alright? I'll try.
- You'll try?

09:15.571 --> 09:17.811
- That is why it is good thing
that we only have one kid.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.122
You realize he knows we're talking
about him. Just say goodbye.

09:34.548 --> 09:37.352
- Bye, honey!
- Are you really going skydiving?

09:38.198 --> 09:41.424
- Don't worry. I'll be fine,
I'll... I'll send you pictures.

09:41.903 --> 09:43.238
-Just don't die, okay?

09:43.766 --> 09:47.879
- I promise. I love you.
- Love you, too.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.529
-Ok, do it.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.512
-What the fuck?

10:39.236 --> 10:40.502
Oh shit!

10:57.291 --> 10:58.291
Oh no...

11:03.345 --> 11:05.389
What the hell?

11:12.271 --> 11:14.513
- Want some help?
- Well..

11:14.538 --> 11:16.507
-Sucks to have that happen.

11:17.401 --> 11:21.822
- Yeah, yeah, I don't know what that
is. It's something jammed in here.

11:22.591 --> 11:23.591
Come off!

11:24.032 --> 11:25.237
-I don't know.

11:26.702 --> 11:29.998
- Did you drive over that?
- I didn't feel anything.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.161
- Maybe it was dropped
off a truck out here?

11:32.332 --> 11:34.764
I wouldn't just pull it out of there.
A garage

11:34.789 --> 11:37.273
will do that without
tearing up the whole tire.

11:38.213 --> 11:41.752
You got roadside insurance? 'Cause then
you could get that replaced for free.

11:41.777 --> 11:43.894
-Why should I do something so practical?

11:46.638 --> 11:49.794
It's okay. I've changed tires before.

11:50.103 --> 11:53.344
I'm fine. -Are you sure?
I'm here. I can help.

11:53.369 --> 11:55.505
Why do you want to do it yourself?

11:58.192 --> 12:01.164
- If you insist. It's... it's
pretty nice of you.

12:01.196 --> 12:02.196
-No problem.

12:02.237 --> 12:04.474
Listen, I've had my share
of flats in my life,

12:04.499 --> 12:06.687
I could probably do this
with my eyes closed.

12:07.868 --> 12:12.373
Tommy, wait in the van.
 -If you guys are talking I want to smoke.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.629
-You must have some place to be.

12:16.654 --> 12:19.697
-No, we're just headed to a swap meet.
We've got to check out crockpots.

12:19.725 --> 12:21.683
Everybody's talking
about crock pots.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.283
My sister even has got me
this crockpot cookbook.

12:24.335 --> 12:27.235
She said they're everywhere now.
I said, "Are

12:27.260 --> 12:29.906
you sure you don't
mean track pots?"

12:32.935 --> 12:35.611
-Okay. Shall we?
-Yeah.

12:43.487 --> 12:47.282
I'm gonna get your spare on, and then
you get to a garage and get past this...???

12:47.366 --> 12:51.995
Should be one just a little ways down,
right at the intersection of 42 and I-70.

12:52.079 --> 12:55.752
There's a Mike's ice-cream
shop right there. Got the big cone outside.

12:55.777 --> 12:57.987
-Go!

13:01.977 --> 13:02.977
Do it.

13:48.719 --> 13:51.204
-All good?
-No worries.

14:20.209 --> 14:23.337
-This is gonna wear off
in about fifteen minutes.

14:24.588 --> 14:25.979
Alright.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.996
No, no, it's okay.

14:33.972 --> 14:35.379
Hold still.

14:44.775 --> 14:45.725
Okay.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.279
We're going to be driving
for a long time.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.161
Nod yes if you want me to pull off
your panties to make it easier to pee.

14:58.956 --> 15:04.002
Okay. I'm going to undo one of your legs.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.169
You can put your underwear aside.

15:12.761 --> 15:14.673
Good girl.

17:53.714 --> 17:56.056
-Fill it up, I'm going to hit the head.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.811
-You seem to be holding up fine.

18:10.606 --> 18:14.318
Open your mouth wide. I mean it, I mean it.
I don't want to jab you.

18:33.003 --> 18:35.517
This has some sleeping
pills dissolved in it.

18:35.542 --> 18:38.030
Now, you're gonna some need to
rest before what happens next.

18:38.043 --> 18:41.491
Swallow, swallow, swallow.

18:43.305 --> 18:44.669
<i>Swallow.</i>

18:47.851 --> 18:49.356
Well done.

18:50.455 --> 18:51.856
What do they do???

18:51.878 --> 18:53.720
-What do you want from me?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.543
No, no.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.790
- Where are we putting her?
- We need to check with Terrence.

20:55.312 --> 20:57.617
<i>-They need us.</i>

20:57.981 --> 21:01.068
-What for? What are these fucking people?

21:04.029 --> 21:06.051
-G10-12 x.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.406
Remember that.
-What's that?

21:09.743 --> 21:12.121
-G10-12 x.

21:14.164 --> 21:15.450
-Where are we?

21:37.938 --> 21:41.442
G10-12 x, G10-12 x...

22:34.453 --> 22:36.464
-Okay, let's take the tape off you.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.841
You take care of the pants.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.294
-I'll be right back.

23:31.719 --> 23:33.503
-Help!

23:34.221 --> 23:35.499
Help!

24:10.507 --> 24:15.387
-Don't joke around. This
will loosen up the tape.

24:17.181 --> 24:20.976
We have food for you, as
long as you don't scream.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.548
-I'm not going to eat your fucking food.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.177
-Not that you can't
scream all you want.

24:27.202 --> 24:29.767
The facility is secure,
but the screams...

24:30.778 --> 24:32.982
They'll unsettle the other subjects.

24:51.048 --> 24:52.202
Hold still.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.578
Interesting skin.

25:33.048 --> 25:37.845
If it's going to happen, I'll tell you.
It will happen fast.

25:38.929 --> 25:42.371
You will think that you
can't survive, and then...

25:43.559 --> 25:44.942
Wham!

25:46.729 --> 25:52.735
You will be amazed. Unless, of course,
it doesn't happen, in which case,...

25:55.612 --> 25:57.694
we'll handle you another way entirely.

27:19.863 --> 27:24.743
-Where are you taking me?
No, don't take me back there. No!

27:45.013 --> 27:46.161
Hello?!

27:47.683 --> 27:49.474
I am the room next door!

27:52.271 --> 27:53.916
My name is Blake!

27:56.024 --> 28:00.446
I can hear you struggling. I
promise I am not one of them!

28:01.780 --> 28:03.423
What is your name?

28:07.161 --> 28:10.062
-Renee. I'm Renee.

28:10.664 --> 28:14.209
How long have you been here?
- I've lost track!

28:14.293 --> 28:16.741
They say I have one
last chance to perform!

28:17.212 --> 28:20.090
-To perform? Well, what
do you mean perform?

28:20.174 --> 28:23.557
-They bring something into your room,
something you don't want brought in.

28:23.732 --> 28:24.691
-Like what?

28:24.980 --> 28:28.648
-Whatever they figured out by watching you.
It's different for everyone.

28:29.725 --> 28:33.136
-What is G10-12X?
 -What?

28:33.395 --> 28:35.311
-G10-12X.

28:36.440 --> 28:41.666
I saw someone in the hallway. He said
they need us, they need us for G10-12X.

28:42.237 --> 28:44.242
-I have no idea.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.496
-This isn't about ransom.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.384
-Are you rich?
-Hardly.

29:03.328 --> 29:04.705
-Do you know anyone rich?

29:05.336 --> 29:06.817
-Not really.

29:07.453 --> 29:10.627
-Me neither. Where are you from?

29:11.600 --> 29:16.479
- Kansas City... Missouri.
- Maybe that's where we are.

29:17.439 --> 29:20.227
-No, I was in that van forever.

29:20.252 --> 29:23.229
They drugged me. I don't
know how long we drove.

29:23.487 --> 29:26.949
-Me, too!
 -Where are you from?

29:27.991 --> 29:30.536
-Elko, Elko, Nevada.

29:32.162 --> 29:33.929
Are you trying to get free?

29:34.707 --> 29:36.368
It won't happen.

29:55.269 --> 29:58.780
-How many people are being held here?
-20.

29:59.273 --> 30:03.306
The first day I arrived here, I heard
someone in your room being released.

30:03.736 --> 30:06.519
-Why wouldn't he tell people
what's going on here?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.576
He knew you were still here, right?

30:10.701 --> 30:13.771
-Maybe he didn't know where we are.

30:15.706 --> 30:16.963
-Maybe he's dead.

30:20.627 --> 30:25.027
- Blake, we asked you to stay quiet.
- I just wanted to talk to someone.

30:25.632 --> 30:30.262
No, not my eyes! Not my eyes!
Not my eyes!

30:41.941 --> 30:42.941
-Hold him down.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.893
-How's are you so far, Renee?

31:03.540 --> 31:05.947
-Blake told me you
sometimes let people go.

31:06.006 --> 31:07.299
-Who is Blake?

31:08.592 --> 31:10.526
-You know, Blake.

31:10.728 --> 31:11.728
Next door.

31:12.846 --> 31:17.476
-Is Blake the name of some voice you heard?
And you believed everything it said?

31:17.570 --> 31:21.563
Maybe that gave you some comfort.
Or maybe everything here's

31:21.594 --> 31:24.306
been arranged to mislead you and
this Blake is a part of that.

31:24.775 --> 31:28.131
Or you maybe you should
believe this Blake, because

31:28.156 --> 31:30.930
maybe I'm just fucking
with you right now.

31:48.632 --> 31:53.196
-We often find after we're done we
need to record everything that happens.

31:53.929 --> 31:57.099
The footage can help us see
exactly what went wrong.

31:58.642 --> 31:59.973
-Please...

32:00.943 --> 32:01.943
Please...

32:03.031 --> 32:07.231
If you need me to like me not...
say anything.... I won't.

32:08.444 --> 32:12.281
But you have to let me go. I have a son.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.367
-Evan. Yes, we know about your son.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.580
-Is... is this about him somehow?

32:20.914 --> 32:26.402
Is he here somewhere? Did you take him?
You didn't take him, did you?

32:26.837 --> 32:31.520
I need to see my son, Please!
-We haven't taken your son.

32:32.259 --> 32:35.089
He is with his father for the
weekend, just where you left him.

32:36.638 --> 32:40.350
- What do you want from me?
- Try to breathe normally.

32:40.434 --> 32:42.860
-if you let me go, I'll
fucking breathe normally!

32:43.687 --> 32:46.190
-This is just a blood-pressure test.

32:47.691 --> 32:49.017
-State your name.

32:52.821 --> 32:54.847
-Renee Morgan.
 -Your full name.

32:55.735 --> 32:58.142
Renee Marie Morgan.

32:59.870 --> 33:02.580
-Place of birth?
-Montreal, Canada.

33:02.831 --> 33:07.252
-And your date of birth?
-August 25th, 1980.

33:07.888 --> 33:10.155
-Is that the date of birth you...?

33:15.010 --> 33:17.223
-Are you the Government?
 -Your height?

33:18.263 --> 33:19.538
<i>-Are you the Government?</i>

33:20.808 --> 33:23.705
-Your height, please.
 -Five foot five.

33:24.103 --> 33:27.398
-Are...are you some government?
-Weight? Your current weight.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.780
-150. Are you ...?

33:32.152 --> 33:35.906
Oh, wait, are you the CDC?

33:39.535 --> 33:43.455
Was I exposed to some germ
or...or disease or virus?

33:43.539 --> 33:45.904
You would tell me if I was sick, right?

33:45.929 --> 33:47.998
You would tell me if there was
something wrong with me?

33:48.023 --> 33:52.006
-Renee, the questions that you're
asking just aren't pertinent.

33:52.031 --> 33:56.178
-Shut up! Shut up, you fucking
freak and let me go!

34:09.857 --> 34:13.858
What do you want
 me to do? I'll help.

34:15.571 --> 34:17.016
I'll cooperate.

34:21.243 --> 34:23.016
You have to let me go.

34:25.914 --> 34:28.592
It'll be easier if I cooperate, right?

34:32.880 --> 34:34.797
<i>Just tell me what to do.</i>

34:51.565 --> 34:53.371
-Read the bottommost line.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.038
-M...

35:01.033 --> 35:02.166
I...

35:02.785 --> 35:04.189
I don't know.

35:05.788 --> 35:06.886
-Try again.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.445
<i>-I...I can't make those out.</i>

35:12.878 --> 35:15.447
-Any food allergies?
-No.

35:15.472 --> 35:18.991
-Not sunflower oil or
sunflower seeds?

35:21.178 --> 35:26.600
-Uh...I don't know. I never really liked
eating seeds. Why you ask?

35:26.683 --> 35:30.604
-Did you notice any change
in your allergies after you gave birth?

35:32.523 --> 35:33.511
-No.

35:35.609 --> 35:39.822
Please, please, don't
leave my son without me.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.919
-42, 67, 44...

35:54.002 --> 35:56.547
-What? -What do you think I just said?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.943
-Four, something. I...I don't know.

36:00.050 --> 36:03.735
-Say yes if you suffer or have ever
suffered from one of the following:

36:04.388 --> 36:05.527
Angina.
-No.

36:05.552 --> 36:06.982
- Asthma, -No.

36:07.216 --> 36:08.232
-Bronchitis.
-No.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.578
- Scarlet fever, -No

36:09.603 --> 36:10.926

-No.

36:10.951 --> 36:11.985

-No.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.285
- Sinusitis.
-No.

36:13.310 --> 36:14.436
-Emphysema...
-No.

36:14.461 --> 36:15.822
-Anemia ...
-Sometimes.

36:18.110 --> 36:20.320
-Reproductive system issues?
-Good.

36:20.404 --> 36:22.297
-Number of children?
-One.

36:23.741 --> 36:25.598
-Desired number of children?

36:27.786 --> 36:28.913
-None of your business.

36:28.938 --> 36:31.675
-Report suggested that you
wanted more than one child.

36:31.915 --> 36:34.204
-The report should know that I am divorced.

36:35.544 --> 36:38.386
-Compulsive habits
such as nail-biting,

36:38.411 --> 36:40.698
restless pacing, finger drumming

36:40.758 --> 36:43.631
Cracking knuckles?
-No.

36:43.780 --> 36:47.018
-No?  You don't drum
your fingers sometimes?

36:47.069 --> 36:48.069
-Christ...

36:48.432 --> 36:50.495
How long have you been watching me?

36:52.770 --> 36:54.530
-Fear of darkness?
-No.

36:54.555 --> 36:55.664
-Fear of sex?
 -No.

36:55.689 --> 36:57.497
Fear of snakes?
-No.

36:57.522 --> 36:58.975
-Fear of drowning?
-No.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.045
-Fear of spiders?

37:03.489 --> 37:04.821
Fear of spiders?

37:06.658 --> 37:09.209
-Right now I'm afraid of everything. Okay?

37:41.860 --> 37:45.294
-This is just so that we don't
have to go poking at you again and again.

38:37.624 --> 38:39.222
-You'll feel it soon.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.068
I'm sure. of it

39:21.919 --> 39:24.630
Come on!

39:40.229 --> 39:43.127
Fuck! Fuck!

39:44.817 --> 39:45.928
Oh shit!

39:56.495 --> 39:58.377
-Good color.

39:59.331 --> 40:01.706
-Hungry?
-No.

40:14.638 --> 40:16.287
<i>-Interesting skin.</i>

40:18.100 --> 40:21.828
And her file is impressive, isn't it?
- Yes, it is, Dr. Raxlen.

40:22.771 --> 40:24.131
- I'll gladly make my mark.

40:24.179 --> 40:26.947
-If it were up to me,
we'd go straight to your desk

40:26.984 --> 40:30.946
but I have agreed with the
others to go through protocol.

40:33.490 --> 40:34.577
-Lights.

40:43.167 --> 40:45.085
-Is that the G10-12 x?

40:45.169 --> 40:47.980
-How do you about G10-12 x?

40:48.505 --> 40:49.579
-I don't.

40:49.604 --> 40:52.825
-If she already knows about
it is extremely good news.

40:52.885 --> 40:56.504
-No. I...I just heard
about it in the corridor.

40:56.529 --> 40:58.118
-This is hardly a G10-12 x.

40:58.974 --> 41:03.562
If you find out what it is then,
you have made great progress.

41:04.772 --> 41:09.026
This is a solution that can
help accelerate the process.

41:09.109 --> 41:13.614
Think of it as chemical encouragement
to an entirely different way of life.

41:15.324 --> 41:20.120
-40 ccs administered at ...?
 -11.39 AM.

41:23.332 --> 41:25.914
Renee, you are being very brave.

41:26.919 --> 41:31.507
You don't have to cater to her, Diane. If
she's going to help us, she'll understand.

41:32.049 --> 41:33.624
If she doesn't...

41:37.846 --> 41:39.628
- What do you want from me?

41:44.144 --> 41:46.278
What do you want with me?

41:49.900 --> 41:53.028
Please let me see my son again.

41:54.696 --> 41:55.770
Please.

41:58.075 --> 41:59.337
Evan.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.368
My Evan...

42:24.727 --> 42:27.585
-Leave her right there. I'll
get her feet up in the stirrups.

42:27.609 --> 42:29.609
-Yes, Doctor. ???

42:43.579 --> 42:47.125
-You have something very
special in you, Renee.

42:47.875 --> 42:52.100
-Evan...
-Of course you will see your boy again.

42:53.047 --> 42:55.182
But we need you first.

43:35.339 --> 43:36.882
-Mom!

43:38.175 --> 43:40.135
Mom!

43:41.220 --> 43:43.263
Mom!

43:43.347 --> 43:45.265
Mom!

43:50.938 --> 43:53.556
-I am very pleased with
that little nap you took.

43:53.581 --> 43:55.883
Not everyone absorbs
the solution that way.

43:56.985 --> 43:58.573
An excellent sign.

44:25.055 --> 44:28.213
<i>-I won't last long.
-You don't know that.</i>

44:28.308 --> 44:32.778
-I was supposed to get married next month.
Tell my fiancee I love her.

44:33.105 --> 44:35.154
-She can't help you now, Seth.

45:22.696 --> 45:27.534
-Renee, we're trying to help you.
-What?

46:10.661 --> 46:13.368
Oh, no! Oh, please, no!

46:16.250 --> 46:18.252
Oh, no...

46:22.208 --> 46:23.208
Oh...

46:23.924 --> 46:25.575
Oh, no.

46:34.935 --> 46:37.850
- Oh, please. Please, please,
please, stop it, please!

46:37.875 --> 46:40.047
- We're not the ones
who can stop this.

46:41.316 --> 46:43.485
-Oh my God!

47:01.842 --> 47:02.842
-Oh please....

47:07.885 --> 47:09.889
Oh please...

47:11.388 --> 47:16.060
- What do you want from me?
-Stop asking us. It's up to you.

47:16.143 --> 47:20.355
-The venom of this particular species
is extremely virulent.

47:20.439 --> 47:25.235
Human spinal fluid literally boils
when it encounters the poison.

47:31.742 --> 47:37.122
-Renee, don't fight it. Let it happen.

47:50.010 --> 47:53.013
-Nothing yet.
-Please, stop.

48:17.621 --> 48:20.348
-I thought that it would
happen right away.

48:20.373 --> 48:21.445
-Maybe on the second test.

48:47.401 --> 48:48.902
-Did you understand?

48:50.446 --> 48:52.893
Did you learn what I was telling you?

48:54.742 --> 48:57.060
-I don't understand anything of this.

48:59.496 --> 49:03.507
Every time I touch her, it feels right.
I just know she's going to rupture.

49:04.543 --> 49:06.089
I believe in her.

49:11.383 --> 49:13.758
-If he's right, it will be over soon.

49:15.304 --> 49:19.433
And then you'll know who you are going
to be for the whole rest of your life.

49:19.516 --> 49:22.225
Of course this will involve pain.

49:28.692 --> 49:30.354
Let her rest now.

51:44.330 --> 51:47.978
<i>-Help me, please! Please!</i>

51:59.176 --> 52:02.336
<i>What the fuck do you want from me?!!</i>

52:09.186 --> 52:11.143
<i>No!</i>

52:12.147 --> 52:14.066
<i>No!</i>

52:20.360 --> 52:24.610
<i>-I am nothing more than
your mind, you know that. ???</i>

52:25.744 --> 52:31.542
<i>The time we spent was
special to me. Just the two of us.</i>

52:34.837 --> 52:40.384
<i>Our special bond. You know
how much I adore you.</i>

52:40.467 --> 52:44.116
<i>You're safe, my son. Right here.</i>

52:44.930 --> 52:46.768
<i>With Dad.</i>

53:02.990 --> 53:07.661
<i>-Do not be mistaken. It's
entirely up to you, Charlie.</i>

53:40.069 --> 53:43.041
-Try to breathe normally.
I'm just checking to

53:43.066 --> 53:45.848
make sure you're absorbing
the accelerator.

53:52.706 --> 53:56.210
-Dr. Raxlen.
-Let's see.

53:57.597 --> 53:58.597
Hmm...

53:59.004 --> 54:01.621
Seth, do you remember
going to the lab?

54:02.716 --> 54:06.220
-No. I don't know.

54:06.303 --> 54:09.761
-Maybe his DNA is just too corrupted.

54:10.516 --> 54:13.852
-Try drowning him again.
Probably he'll respond.

54:13.936 --> 54:16.271
-No! Please, please, no!

54:16.355 --> 54:18.779
Please, no, please, no!

56:09.593 --> 56:11.491
-Yes, but it's in six weeks. ???

56:13.138 --> 56:16.904
- The fucking generator is pulsing again.
- Yeah, I'll get on it.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.529
I'll get a part in town.

56:18.727 --> 56:21.521
-Did you hear about Budapest?
-What about it?

56:21.649 --> 56:24.143
-There's a new rupture there.
She's for real. ???

56:24.817 --> 56:28.818
-With the guy in Boston,
that's a total of 47 ruptures.

56:29.405 --> 56:31.853
-What's the fertility test
on the Budapest chick?

56:32.019 --> 56:33.196
-Nothing.

56:33.818 --> 56:35.821
Sterile.
-Fuck!

56:36.286 --> 56:39.665
-Yeah, 24 women and
none of them fertile.

56:39.689 --> 56:40.991
-Raxlen got any ideas?

56:41.015 --> 56:43.015
-I don't know. I
haven't heard of it.

59:03.892 --> 59:05.464
<i>-Hello?</i>

59:06.520 --> 59:08.386
-Hello?
-Who's that?

59:08.410 --> 59:09.513
<i>-Blake?</i>

59:10.190 --> 59:12.671
-Are you Renee?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

59:13.444 --> 59:14.965
-How did you get up there?

59:16.655 --> 59:19.349
-If we can just figure out where
they keep those bracelets...

59:21.452 --> 59:23.446
...we can work the doors and get out.

59:24.830 --> 59:28.022
-They're gonna let me go. I'll survive it.

59:28.459 --> 59:32.892
-I don't think freedom has a
plan for us. You sound different.

59:33.255 --> 59:37.297
- I'm in the middle of my final test.
- Which is...?

59:37.676 --> 59:43.098
- I can't say it.
- Did he mention G10-12 x?

59:43.182 --> 59:46.643
-They said I have it.
They think it's inside me.

59:49.688 --> 59:53.108
- What is it?
 -There is something about the skin.

59:53.192 --> 59:55.525
They've were rubbing my face.

01:00:40.322 --> 01:00:45.766
- Blake, you were close. Your terror
almost initiated the DNA change.

01:00:45.994 --> 01:00:49.373
- What's gonna happen to me now?
- You'll be home soon.

01:00:49.456 --> 01:00:51.731
I just need to stake you
for the journey. ???

01:00:53.836 --> 01:00:58.494
- Please, I...I want to go home.
- This may feel a little cold.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:05.389
-Blake, you're going to wake up
back in Nevada. Near your home.

01:01:05.472 --> 01:01:09.922
And you will remember an experience that
will change the way you look at the world.

01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:12.598
-I don't want to
remember anything.

01:01:12.623 --> 01:01:15.882
-When you're outside again,
you will feel wonderful.

01:01:15.941 --> 01:01:18.834
You'll have answers to
questions that people

01:01:18.859 --> 01:01:20.960
have been asking for
a long, long time.

01:01:21.488 --> 01:01:25.242
- Doesn't that sound exciting?
- Yes, yes, it does.

01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:32.446
-Blake, we're going to teach you how to
think about what went on here.

01:01:32.728 --> 01:01:34.757
Do you understand?
-Yes.

01:01:39.965 --> 01:01:42.831
-No falling asleep just yet. Alright?

01:01:44.261 --> 01:01:45.335
-Okay.

01:01:46.597 --> 01:01:50.197
-I'm Collette. I'm in
charge of reintegration.

01:01:51.143 --> 01:01:55.522
Are you ready for that? Are you
ready to go back to life?

01:01:55.606 --> 01:01:56.989
-I want to.

01:04:16.288 --> 01:04:17.620
-Fuck!

01:07:01.908 --> 01:07:03.986
-Try to get the rest.
-You sure?

01:07:14.091 --> 01:07:19.744
- You see? He was so close. He and Blake.
- Don't talk to me about close.

01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:21.434
-There's still Renee Morgan.

01:07:22.975 --> 01:07:26.078
-It's time to see if you
could help her along, Diane.

01:07:26.103 --> 01:07:28.796
-Yeah, good idea, let's
get ready for her.

01:08:50.938 --> 01:08:52.587
-Any hallucinations?

01:08:55.734 --> 01:08:58.660
-No. I...I... know.

01:08:59.863 --> 01:09:04.145
 What’s in that orange stuff?
-You’re not sure if you're hallucinating?

01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:11.457
- I've seen some weird shit. If you tell
me it's not real I'll feel much better.

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:15.645
-Well, this confusion is
all part of the process.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.807
The pulse is good. She is ready to go.

01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:24.307
I'll let them know.

01:09:25.848 --> 01:09:30.935
Good luck, Renee. We all
have very high hopes for you.

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.830
-This would be so much easier if
you'd just stopped fighting.

01:09:49.904 --> 01:09:52.956
If you try to frighten people
to death, they fight back.

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:56.111
No, Renee, We're trying to
frighten you past death.

01:09:56.136 --> 01:09:58.362
- What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:31.915
-Your son is going to be just fine.

01:10:33.582 --> 01:10:36.899
The problems he's
having with math,

01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:40.477
his inability to control his
emotions, his anger.

01:10:40.798 --> 01:10:43.299
We can solve those problems.

01:10:44.468 --> 01:10:49.056
- How do you know?
-You just told me through your skin.

01:10:51.065 --> 01:10:53.408
We learn things that way.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:54.850
-What?

01:10:55.896 --> 01:10:58.822
-G10-12 x is a genetic code.

01:10:59.566 --> 01:11:02.444
We all have it in our chromosomes.

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:07.157
We are trying to rupture that
part of your genes.

01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:15.062
- What happens when you rupture?
- I think you know what to do.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:21.130
When you take the fear in your
bones, it changes the shape of you.

01:11:22.423 --> 01:11:25.154
Accept it. Be yourself.

01:11:29.805 --> 01:11:33.851
I'll show you what we really are.
Maybe that will help you.

01:13:17.496 --> 01:13:18.535
Fuck!

01:15:37.846 --> 01:15:39.779
-How long have you been...???

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.302
-He is back.

01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:45.858
-I'll show you what I'm talking about. The
ovum we removed from Renee Morgan.

01:15:46.311 --> 01:15:49.322
It's not behaving like any
other ovum I've examined before.

01:15:49.982 --> 01:15:54.129
- Is that good?
-I hope so. Take a look.

01:15:57.197 --> 01:16:01.709
- What's so unusual?
-Those are human sperm, not ours.

01:16:02.077 --> 01:16:06.778
The ovum is no longer permitting any human
sperm to penetrate to the membrane.

01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:11.879
I think Renee is close. Her
egg might only receive our DNA now.

01:16:11.962 --> 01:16:15.549
I'll have to take more samples, but...
-What?

01:17:09.686 --> 01:17:10.930
-Fuck!

01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:43.006
-You've taken out your IV again.
Would you like some solid to eat?

01:19:44.091 --> 01:19:46.849
-What was in that?
-Just a sugar solution.

01:19:47.428 --> 01:19:50.775
We had to keep you going somehow.
It's been a day and a half.

01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:54.745
- It doesn't feel that long.
-Time moves differently for us.

01:19:55.644 --> 01:19:59.314
We don't degenerate
at the human pace.

01:19:59.382 --> 01:20:02.028
-Are you going to punish me for
breaking into the lab?

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:04.756
-No...Why would you think that?

01:20:07.489 --> 01:20:13.495
We like the ones with a
strong survival instinct and spirit.

01:20:13.579 --> 01:20:16.957
- Some food, perhaps?
 -I don't want anything from you.

01:20:19.293 --> 01:20:22.755
<i>-42, 67, 44.</i>

01:20:24.339 --> 01:20:26.884
-Tell me what I just said.
 -No.

01:20:26.967 --> 01:20:28.330
-You heard her.

01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:37.015
-42, 67, 44.

01:20:38.645 --> 01:20:39.920
-Good.

01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:46.237
-Can you read this?

01:20:47.488 --> 01:20:53.285
-It is my medical record.
-It was too small for you to read before.

01:20:53.369 --> 01:20:56.663
Have your eyes become sensitive
to white light, like ours?

01:20:57.175 --> 01:21:02.586
We prefer softer bands of the
spectrum, like, uh, purple, yellow.

01:21:04.454 --> 01:21:06.602
-Are you trying to
make me into you?

01:21:06.627 --> 01:21:09.789
-This is something you have
to do yourself, Renee.

01:21:10.594 --> 01:21:12.824
From within.

01:21:13.764 --> 01:21:15.214
-I don't want to change.

01:21:15.239 --> 01:21:18.770
-Why would you fight this
marvelous transformation?

01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:23.227
The rupture will spare you so many fears.

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:27.941
This is the next step on
the evolutionary ladder.

01:21:28.362 --> 01:21:33.409
All that human emotional nonsense
can be obliterated forever.

01:21:33.492 --> 01:21:39.540
-Please, you have to let me go.
My son needs me.

01:21:42.584 --> 01:21:44.497
-You need to eat, Renee.

01:21:52.469 --> 01:21:54.785
-Dr. Raxlan's told
us that you've been

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:57.540
strikingly resourceful
in your time with us.

01:21:57.599 --> 01:22:00.936
Did you think you ran all over
this facility without us knowing?

01:22:04.148 --> 01:22:07.018
-Now, perhaps you'd like to see your son.

01:22:11.488 --> 01:22:16.160
-Once you rupture, you will no
longer feel this human love.

01:22:16.243 --> 01:22:20.112
-Now that medical records are available
online, we'll find more leads.

01:22:21.665 --> 01:22:24.747
There are markers in your profile.
Your blood

01:22:24.772 --> 01:22:27.987
pressures, certain
allergies, family histories.

01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:30.632
All these details showed us the

01:22:30.716 --> 01:22:34.762
G10-12 x-sequence in
your gene be accessible.

01:22:38.724 --> 01:22:39.764
-Enough.

01:22:43.937 --> 01:22:48.609
-I have seen you. You're not human.
None of you are.

01:22:50.569 --> 01:22:55.016
-We started as human, just like you.

01:22:55.657 --> 01:22:56.969
But then...

01:23:02.373 --> 01:23:08.253
If you pass the test, Renee,
your terror will transform you...

01:23:08.337 --> 01:23:11.187
into someone fundamentally new.

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:17.352
The human race is destroying everything.
The Earth, the oceans, even the sky.

01:23:17.638 --> 01:23:23.032
-People are the virus and we are the cure.

01:23:23.477 --> 01:23:27.480
Order must be restored. Do you understand?

01:23:28.399 --> 01:23:30.609
And only we can do it.

01:23:30.692 --> 01:23:34.995
All of this will become clear, as it
did was for us with our own ruptures.

01:23:35.697 --> 01:23:38.523
And then you'll join us in our world.

01:23:39.743 --> 01:23:44.483
-Which is?
 -First, we must build our numbers. ???

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:49.770
And if you rupture, we'll be one stronger.

01:23:50.337 --> 01:23:51.818
-And if I don't?

01:23:51.843 --> 01:23:56.284
-Sometimes we're mistaken about the
potential of certain prospects.

01:23:56.814 --> 01:24:00.830
When they survive, Collette has found a way
to safely return them to their lives..

01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:03.060
When they don't...

01:24:04.393 --> 01:24:10.691
- Their skin corrodes.
- Because their DNA is corrupted.

01:24:10.774 --> 01:24:15.650
Honestly, I think we're doing the gene
pool a favor by raiding them out.

01:24:16.947 --> 01:24:19.610
Cull in the herd, so to speak.

01:24:20.909 --> 01:24:25.202
-Another bite?
-No.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.504
-Let's move forward then.

01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:50.103
-No...

01:25:18.801 --> 01:25:20.528
Oh no...

01:26:17.568 --> 01:26:20.863
Take it off me!

01:26:28.078 --> 01:26:31.623
- It is entirely up to you, Renee.
- Go to hell!

01:27:47.116 --> 01:27:52.900
Tell everybody that Evan and I are great.
I've just got this incredible job and...

01:27:53.372 --> 01:27:55.958
I can't release anything about it yet.

01:27:56.041 --> 01:28:01.791
-That's good, Renee. But you'll fool
people by adding enthusiasm to your voice.

01:28:02.548 --> 01:28:04.160
Le's try again.

01:28:04.925 --> 01:28:09.899
-I've got this incredible job.
 -What is it?

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:14.435
-I can't really talk about it yet.
 -Why not?

01:28:14.518 --> 01:28:18.105
-If I'm...If I'm lucky,
you hear about it soon.

01:28:18.188 --> 01:28:22.545
-Now, your friends and colleagues
will notice you've changed

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:28.009
but never give them any explanation,
no matter how hard they might pry.

01:28:28.365 --> 01:28:31.689
-<i>Five tornadoes in Oklahoma,
another three in Nebraska and</i>

01:28:31.714 --> 01:28:34.812
two in Kansas, and that is
in the last twelve months .

01:28:42.337 --> 01:28:45.417
<i>-I really never really expected
to be one of those people.</i>

01:28:45.606 --> 01:28:46.606
<i>The abductees.</i>

01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:48.574
<i>-Blake, where did it happen?</i>

01:28:49.178 --> 01:28:53.265
<i>-I was at home in Nevada. And not
the desert, the nice suburbs.</i>

01:28:54.224 --> 01:28:57.597
<i>I'd just gotten out of
dinner from Red Lobster</i>

01:28:57.622 --> 01:29:00.922
<i>and this white orb
descended from the clouds.</i>

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:06.153
<i>It pulled me up. I
melted through the wall.</i>

01:29:06.236 --> 01:29:11.200
<i>They wanted to know all about the people
in this planet. They took fluids from me.</i>

01:29:11.283 --> 01:29:14.178
<i>It wasn't painful, but I had no choice.</i>

01:29:15.537 --> 01:29:18.551
-Hi, mom.
-We don't have any milk?

01:29:19.124 --> 01:29:21.101
Didn't you go shopping
while I was at dad's?

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.171
- I can make you toast.
- You're wearing colored contacts?

01:29:26.541 --> 01:29:27.541
-Yeah.

01:29:28.008 --> 01:29:31.651
-Why?
-I wanted to try something new.

01:29:33.212 --> 01:29:34.212
-Oh.

01:29:35.474 --> 01:29:39.472
Sweetheart, while you were
at your father's, I met people who...

01:29:40.604 --> 01:29:43.022
...who are incredibly good with math.

01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:50.531
They had these... workshops that....uh... I
think could help you make good progress.

01:29:50.605 --> 01:29:55.728
-Mom, I don't... think so.
- It will only be for a few days.

01:29:56.304 --> 01:29:57.849
Be open minded.
-No!

01:29:58.144 --> 01:30:01.339
Who are these people, anyways?
 -They are very smart.

01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:05.313
-Forget it, I'm not going!
You're acting really weird.

01:30:05.879 --> 01:30:07.962
What the hell is wrong with you, mom?

01:30:25.357 --> 01:30:26.990
-Where is Evan, Renee?

01:30:33.157 --> 01:30:35.471
-Is that necessary?

01:30:35.852 --> 01:30:40.481
- Please don't use it on him.
- No, no, only if we need to.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:43.417
-He doesn't need---
-Stay... calm.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:49.476
You must recognize the amazing potential
that exists in your genetic line.

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.572
-That's wonderful news, Renee. We
got the test back.

01:30:54.136 --> 01:30:56.881
You're still fertile
even after the rupture.

01:30:56.906 --> 01:30:59.467
This also builds
extremely well for Evan.

01:31:04.605 --> 01:31:06.003
-Where is he now?

01:31:06.815 --> 01:31:11.408
-He will be down soon.
He's just packing some stuff.

01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:14.473
-Ah.

01:31:30.714 --> 01:31:32.005
-Try the bedroom.

01:31:38.389 --> 01:31:43.185
-Evan?
-Mom! Mom!

01:31:43.268 --> 01:31:45.208
-The door is locked.
-Kick it open.

01:31:47.898 --> 01:31:49.542
-Get out of here!

01:31:59.493 --> 01:32:00.763
-He got out.

01:32:37.906 --> 01:32:42.369
-We're not going to be chasing him.
Do you know why?

01:32:42.453 --> 01:32:45.114
Because you and I, we're gonna find him.

01:32:46.081 --> 01:32:47.513
Together.

01:32:49.138 --> 01:32:50.138
Uh-huh.

01:32:52.671 --> 01:32:56.800
I know how painful this can be.

01:33:00.429 --> 01:33:03.727
The vestiges of our old feelings.

01:33:04.808 --> 01:33:08.771
they don't always disappear as
quickly as we would like them to.

01:33:10.314 --> 01:33:12.210
But soon they will.

01:33:12.608 --> 01:33:17.613
And what you really care about of
your many children you'll give us.

01:33:19.323 --> 01:33:24.578
We believe that you will be the
mother of a brand new generation.

01:33:26.205 --> 01:33:32.447
The world as humans have known
it will be changed... forever.

01:33:47.226 --> 01:33:52.815
We've been waiting for you
for a long, long time.

01:33:56.318 --> 01:33:58.438
And finally...

01:33:59.863 --> 01:34:01.361
we have you.
