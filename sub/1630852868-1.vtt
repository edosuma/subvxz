01:15.884 --> 01:17.851
What did the big chimney say

01:17.984 --> 01:19.250
to the little chimney?

01:19.383 --> 01:21.283
- No body and no nose?
- The cactus.

01:21.417 --> 01:22.517
Pairs of jeans?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.650
What can you catch
but can't throw?

01:24.784 --> 01:28.118
Say. One guess.
What did the cactus say to...?

01:28.250 --> 01:30.218
Jeans. Erm...

01:30.350 --> 01:31.584
That's my favourite.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.784
I'd have said cheese.

01:39.017 --> 01:42.383
Why did the golfer
bring two pairs of jeans?

01:42.517 --> 01:45.118
What did the big chimney
say to the little chimney?

01:45.250 --> 01:47.550
OK. That's my favourite.

01:50.951 --> 01:53.884
What do you call...?
Why did the golfer...?

01:58.250 --> 01:59.717
Pairs of j...

02:02.984 --> 02:04.751
I'd have said...

04:00.417 --> 04:02.984
That's lovely!

04:03.118 --> 04:05.550
- D'you get the keys?
- Yeah. Got them here.

04:05.684 --> 04:09.350
On the car keys. Let's see.

04:09.484 --> 04:13.650
Maybe this one? Ooh!

04:13.784 --> 04:15.484
I'm just gonna grab
some stuff.

04:15.617 --> 04:16.951
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:34.184 --> 04:36.450
Are you helping your parents?

04:39.151 --> 04:40.984
- I'm Laura.
- I'm Megan.

04:41.118 --> 04:42.784
Pleased to meet you.

04:47.283 --> 04:48.984
Who was here before?

04:49.118 --> 04:51.350
Erm... a wee old lady.

04:52.051 --> 04:53.817
Where's she gone?

04:55.118 --> 04:56.717
She moved away.

04:57.383 --> 04:59.283
Where'd she go?

05:00.151 --> 05:01.550
Megan?

05:02.484 --> 05:04.617
Your mammy's calling you.

05:27.484 --> 05:30.817
New neighbours?
Did they speak to you?

05:30.951 --> 05:32.751
They have a wee girl.

05:34.118 --> 05:35.917
She's cute.

05:36.051 --> 05:39.784
Cuter than me?

05:57.751 --> 06:01.283
- Just went that way.
- All right. See ya later.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.017
- Hi, Mum.
- Hi.

06:03.151 --> 06:05.484
Where do you think her mum is?
Do you think she's on her way?

06:05.617 --> 06:07.684
Er, I've no idea.

06:07.817 --> 06:09.717
We were gonna go to Caitlin's.

06:09.851 --> 06:11.617
Come on, well.
I'm starving.

06:11.751 --> 06:14.751
You're not starving!

06:14.884 --> 06:18.017
- I'm just gonna check she's OK.
- Mum!

06:18.151 --> 06:19.684
Mum!

06:22.383 --> 06:23.817
Hi, sweetheart.
Are you, are you OK?

06:23.951 --> 06:26.084
Is your mum
coming to collect you?

06:26.218 --> 06:29.017
Dunno.

06:29.151 --> 06:30.650
Well, do you want us to wait?

06:30.784 --> 06:32.350
Can you give me a lift?

06:32.484 --> 06:34.250
I'm sure your mammy's
on her way.

06:34.383 --> 06:36.250
Oh, please. I'm freezing.

06:38.984 --> 06:43.984
- I'm not allowed, sweetheart.
- Just tell the teacher.

06:46.151 --> 06:47.550
Please.

06:48.884 --> 06:53.017
Come on, well.
Just this once.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.984
Goodness' sake!

06:57.151 --> 06:58.684
Seat belt.

06:59.417 --> 07:00.917
Great.

07:08.951 --> 07:11.383
Did you have a good day
at school, Megan?

07:12.617 --> 07:13.817
Do you like school?

07:13.951 --> 07:16.051
Ah, it's OK.
I prefer hang-gliding.

07:16.184 --> 07:18.584
Well...

07:18.717 --> 07:21.450
All the after-school
clubs are knitting and stuff.

07:21.584 --> 07:24.584
I wish they had
a hang-gliding club.

07:24.717 --> 07:28.084
Well, anything's better
than maths, isn't it, Tadhg?

07:28.218 --> 07:31.450
I have to tell my mammy
we have a hamster in the class.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.218
Have you had a lot of pets?

07:33.350 --> 07:37.184
- I used to have a husky.
- Wow!

07:37.317 --> 07:38.684
And my cat had five kittens.

07:38.817 --> 07:42.317
- Five!
- Yeah. But two suffocated

07:42.450 --> 07:44.650
cos they always
sleep on top of each other.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.484
Mum, remember I'm going

07:47.617 --> 07:49.118
to Smickers's house
this weekend, OK?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.717
- You're what?
- I'm hanging out at Smickers's.

07:51.851 --> 07:54.350
- You said I could stay.
- I said no such thing.

07:54.484 --> 07:56.817
- Mum.
- Don't "Mum" me.

07:56.951 --> 07:58.717
Do you remember there?

08:16.550 --> 08:22.450
There you are! Megan.
Where did you go?

08:22.584 --> 08:26.283
I went to the school
and you weren't there.

08:26.417 --> 08:29.283
Listen, thanks
for taking her back, yeah?

08:29.417 --> 08:31.218
No bother.

08:31.350 --> 08:34.051
- See you.
- See you.

08:40.484 --> 08:43.884
Ah... That's horrible.

08:44.017 --> 08:47.184
I mean, you're literally
licking your own tongue.

08:51.383 --> 08:52.584
It's good, that.

08:52.717 --> 08:55.250
You should invite Megan
over for dinner.

08:55.383 --> 08:56.784
No way.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.917
It'd be nice for her
to know that we're here,

08:59.051 --> 09:01.017
in case her mammy
forgets her again.

09:01.151 --> 09:02.417
Forgets her?

09:02.550 --> 09:04.350
- Mum gave her a lift.
- Did you?

09:04.484 --> 09:06.484
She was just standing out.

09:06.617 --> 09:07.884
Did you ask?

09:08.017 --> 09:10.550
She said
she was running late. Marie.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.951
Well, then.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.684
Well, then, what?

09:26.584 --> 09:28.517
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:40.584 --> 09:43.650
I'll just take a bit
of the foliage off.

09:46.684 --> 09:48.751
Kind of like to think
I'll come back

09:48.884 --> 09:52.450
as a snowdrop
or something.

09:52.584 --> 09:55.751
I'm just going
to give this a little clean.

09:55.884 --> 09:58.017
You know me and belief.

09:58.151 --> 10:00.017
I don't know what I believe.

10:01.084 --> 10:02.218
I do.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.317
I think, like, I'd like to...

10:05.051 --> 10:06.550
Right.

10:10.751 --> 10:13.250
- Josie, Josie.
- Take the red ones.

10:13.383 --> 10:17.650
Yeah, she liked them.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.250
I love them, actually.

10:19.383 --> 10:20.917
How do they get them
that colour?

10:21.051 --> 10:24.283
I'd be afraid to ask.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.550
Keep breathing.

10:51.684 --> 10:52.751
OK, we're gonna play around.

10:52.884 --> 10:54.484
We're gonna play around
with that.

10:54.617 --> 10:56.218
Feel the resistance.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.717
And once more
in the saddle, two, one.

11:00.517 --> 11:02.917
OK, one last push. Let's go.

11:04.450 --> 11:07.517
Ready. Let's take it up again
in five...

11:23.784 --> 11:25.417
Hmm.

11:28.484 --> 11:32.784
Do you ever wonder
what she'd be like? Now?

11:37.283 --> 11:38.917
All the time, love.

11:42.317 --> 11:44.283
Yeah. Hmm.

12:17.984 --> 12:20.851
Tadhg? Tadhg. Tadhg, Tadhg!

12:20.984 --> 12:23.017
He's asleep.

12:29.751 --> 12:31.884
He hasn't done that in years.

12:38.817 --> 12:41.283
I text him from Miss McCain.

12:44.517 --> 12:46.051
Mum's coming.

12:46.184 --> 12:49.517
That's good! Megan, do you
want to come for your dinner?

12:49.650 --> 12:50.917
- To your house?
- Yeah.

12:51.051 --> 12:53.283
Do I have to eat it
if I don't like it?

12:53.417 --> 12:57.650
- No. Ask your mam.
- OK.

13:01.151 --> 13:02.184
She's nice.

13:13.450 --> 13:15.817
Chris.

13:15.951 --> 13:17.151
Go ahead.

13:17.283 --> 13:18.417
Here, son.

13:18.550 --> 13:20.984
Go on. Pass, wee man.

13:23.751 --> 13:26.617
Dad... Dad, what do you reckon
I get tattooed?

13:26.751 --> 13:29.884
- A tattoo?
- Something like... manga?

13:30.017 --> 13:32.517
It has to be something
you'll not get sick of.

13:32.650 --> 13:35.017
- Something that means something.
- Yeah.

13:35.151 --> 13:36.484
Maybe if you want to look like

13:36.617 --> 13:38.884
you've just broke out
of Maghaberry Prison.

13:40.650 --> 13:44.317
- All right, take it easy, yeah?
- See you later, Chris.

13:45.484 --> 13:47.417
See you later, mate.

13:48.617 --> 13:50.784
You're having
a fucking laugh.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.617
A lot of it's just lucky.

13:52.751 --> 13:54.717
Tadhg, did you drag
this muck into this house?

13:54.851 --> 13:56.317
Why don't you like Chris?

13:56.450 --> 13:58.784
- Tadhg!
- Cos he has tattoos?

13:58.917 --> 14:02.417
I told you, you can tattoo
your whole face when you're 18.

14:05.517 --> 14:07.684
That'll be Megan.

14:20.584 --> 14:22.218
Everybody got drinks?

14:51.184 --> 14:52.851
Are you OK?

14:52.984 --> 14:55.550
Are you gonna do
the ketchup face?

15:02.917 --> 15:04.617
Yeah.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.917
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.483
See you later.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.951
- Take that in.
- Too heavy.

17:33.084 --> 17:34.584
It's not too heavy.

17:34.717 --> 17:37.517
You wouldn't even be able
to lift it, would you? Huh?

17:41.617 --> 17:43.184
I didn't mean to scare you.

17:43.317 --> 17:46.450
- How are you?
- Dead on.

17:46.584 --> 17:51.151
- How about youse?
- Aye, aye.

17:51.283 --> 17:52.817
It's nice around here.
Quiet, isn't it?

17:52.951 --> 17:56.717
Yeah. It is, yeah. Must be
a change from where you were.

17:58.584 --> 18:00.450
Well, I may take these things
in here.

18:00.584 --> 18:04.717
And Megan?
Is Megan settling in school?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.951
Oh, aye. Likes to craft things.
Full of imagination.

18:08.084 --> 18:09.584
Especially at that age, yeah.

18:09.717 --> 18:12.484
Tadhg once told me
he borrowed a bazooka

18:12.617 --> 18:14.383
and shot his teacher
in the head.

18:14.517 --> 18:17.517
- A bazooka?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:17.650 --> 18:20.617
We all wanted to do that
at school.

18:21.784 --> 18:24.517
Listen, Megan
said something about Tadhg.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.184
What? What did she say?

18:28.317 --> 18:31.383
It's OK if you don't want her
coming round for tea.

18:31.917 --> 18:32.951
But...

18:33.084 --> 18:37.751
Oh, God, he's just
being a wee lad. Sorry.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.417
He told Megan
he didn't want her coming over.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.417
Poor Megan.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.118
I'll murder him.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.684
Well...

18:48.218 --> 18:49.784
He'll apologise.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.684
- I'll see you again.
- Cheerio.

18:59.650 --> 19:00.784
What was that about?

19:00.917 --> 19:02.383
He's in there,
face tripping him.

19:02.517 --> 19:07.283
- He was rude.
- Have you not met our son?

19:10.017 --> 19:12.317
To be honest,
I think he's entitled

19:12.450 --> 19:14.417
not to want
some wee girl coming over.

19:21.417 --> 19:23.283
What is it?

19:25.317 --> 19:27.584
The other night,

19:27.717 --> 19:31.884
she was waiting for me
to do... ketchup face.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.517
Yeah.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.817
She'd be about the same age.

19:41.784 --> 19:43.450
When I was giving her
a lift home,

19:43.584 --> 19:45.051
we were passing the graveyard...

19:45.184 --> 19:46.650
What, when Marie was late?

19:46.784 --> 19:50.517
- Yeah. Have you met her?
- No.

20:02.517 --> 20:06.317
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.617
So, the other day
when youse gave Megan a lift,

20:30.751 --> 20:33.517
your mum was saying
she's a bit funny.

21:14.151 --> 21:16.283
- And then fist-bump.
- Hm-hmm.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.550
Up. Down.

21:18.684 --> 21:20.650
Side. But if you remember,
it is this.

21:20.784 --> 21:24.118
One down. Now down.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.017
Yeah. Never below.

21:26.151 --> 21:27.851
Has she got you tortured?

21:27.984 --> 21:31.151
- Can I have this?
- Jesus, Megan! More shite?

21:31.283 --> 21:35.383
- Here, let me get it.
- I was gonna get it her anyway.

21:39.550 --> 21:43.650
Listen, I'm sorry
about giving off about Tadhg.

21:43.784 --> 21:46.250
How was I to know Megan
wasn't making it up?

21:46.383 --> 21:47.784
Oh, sure.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.017
Like, I had to have
a wee chat with her teacher.

21:50.151 --> 21:53.383
- We're hardly here a month.
- Is everything OK?

21:53.517 --> 21:55.017
Aye, yeah.

21:55.151 --> 21:57.317
They just have them writing
these journals, you know?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.383
Aye, Josie did one.

21:59.517 --> 22:01.751
Erm... all the kids
do them at school.

22:01.884 --> 22:04.317
My daughter,
she's not with us any more.

22:05.118 --> 22:07.250
Tadhg did one, too.

22:08.218 --> 22:09.784
Well, teacher asked us

22:09.917 --> 22:13.118
if the things she was writing
were all true and she says yes.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.584
Got into a bit of a barney.

22:14.717 --> 22:16.917
Who cares?
She's only a kid, right?

22:17.051 --> 22:19.084
Yeah, it's not so strange.

22:19.218 --> 22:20.884
Aye, it's just...

22:21.017 --> 22:23.484
It's not like wacky things,
like going to Disneyland

22:23.617 --> 22:25.817
or shooting your teacher
with a bazooka.

22:25.951 --> 22:29.250
Dunno. It's probably
just a wee phase.

22:29.383 --> 22:30.817
It just made me think

22:30.951 --> 22:34.617
maybe she's torturing
your Tadhg or something.

22:34.751 --> 22:37.350
Anyway, well, here,
I'd better get on.

22:37.484 --> 22:39.717
You know...

22:39.851 --> 22:42.650
Megan did say something to me.

22:43.550 --> 22:45.917
It's funny. She said...

22:46.051 --> 22:49.917
She said she's been
to school here before.

22:50.051 --> 22:53.250
Well, she's never been here.
We're not even from Antrim.

22:53.383 --> 22:56.751
Yeah. Strange.

22:56.884 --> 23:00.650
And she said, erm...
she's been to the graveyard.

23:02.350 --> 23:03.917
I mean, how do you explain...?

23:04.051 --> 23:08.650
She's lying. Messing.
Look, that's what kids are like.

23:08.784 --> 23:10.317
Well, here, I'd better get on

23:10.450 --> 23:12.951
cos our Chris
will be wondering where I am.

23:13.084 --> 23:15.517
Bye, Laura. Cheerio.

23:18.084 --> 23:20.817
- What did you get us?
- A couple of these.

23:20.951 --> 23:22.417
Come on, Meg.

23:28.851 --> 23:30.717
Right.

23:30.851 --> 23:32.851
Here you go.

23:42.218 --> 23:46.383
The wee girl puts me
in mind of Josie, that's all.

23:49.283 --> 23:54.484
Do you... wanna talk
maybe, again, to someone?

23:54.617 --> 23:56.650
Save it for your ma.

23:56.784 --> 23:58.851
What's that supposed to mean?

24:01.484 --> 24:03.617
- What?
- Look...

24:04.717 --> 24:06.951
I'm done with counselling.

24:09.084 --> 24:12.184
You might wanna talk about it
day in, day out, but...

24:12.350 --> 24:15.484
I don't.

24:19.051 --> 24:21.350
Don't try and tell me
how I feel.

24:21.484 --> 24:22.684
I wasn't trying...

24:22.817 --> 24:24.617
Your way's no better than mine.

24:24.751 --> 24:26.250
We've been doing OK.

24:26.383 --> 24:30.717
- Well, then...
- So?

24:30.851 --> 24:32.951
What?

24:33.084 --> 24:35.550
We can't be doing this.

24:35.684 --> 24:38.350
- I'm not doing this.
- Going through this.

24:38.484 --> 24:41.051
You all right?

24:41.184 --> 24:42.584
Top left.

24:42.717 --> 24:45.317
- What?
- The nine goes through there

24:45.450 --> 24:47.017
and the nine
has to be in this box.

24:47.151 --> 24:50.383
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no, I have you. Sorry.

24:53.984 --> 24:57.650
There's two numbers left
and that goes through, so...

25:19.151 --> 25:20.817
She's never far.

25:20.951 --> 25:23.151
<i>...through the morning,
but it will soon move away.</i>

25:23.283 --> 25:27.151
<i>The skies will stay cloudy.
Just a few bright spells.</i>

25:28.984 --> 25:31.484
<i>It will be dry.
Just the odd isolated shower.</i>

25:31.617 --> 25:33.084
<i>A few sunny spells will appear.</i>

25:33.218 --> 25:36.550
<i>The skies will be cloudy today
for most of the time.</i>

25:36.684 --> 25:38.784
<i>That same frost
will be making its way south...</i>

25:38.917 --> 25:41.484
If she's with you,
that's your business.

25:41.617 --> 25:44.283
<i>Much of the day
will be damp and cloudy.</i>

25:44.417 --> 25:47.250
<i>It'll be windy and rather cool.</i>

26:09.584 --> 26:10.717
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

26:10.851 --> 26:12.784
What are you doing
out of the car?

26:12.917 --> 26:16.851
Waiting on a bus.
What's it look like? Get in.

26:17.984 --> 26:20.717
- It's horrible.
- You're psycho.

26:20.851 --> 26:23.350
Ugh. Yeah.

27:12.417 --> 27:13.851
Can I join in?

27:13.984 --> 27:15.617
Yeah.

27:29.383 --> 27:32.317
<i>At my school, we go
to the cinema quite a lot,</i>

27:32.450 --> 27:35.917
<i>but my favourite trip
was when we went to the farm.</i>

27:36.051 --> 27:41.317
<i>They had, like,
baby chicks and all.</i>

27:41.450 --> 27:44.283
- <i>Knock, knock.</i>
- <i>Who's there?</i>

27:44.417 --> 27:45.517
<i>Nunnya.</i>

27:45.650 --> 27:47.550
<i>Nunnya who?</i>

27:47.684 --> 27:49.151
<i>Nunnya business!</i>

27:50.984 --> 27:52.751
<i>What did the policeman
say to the snowman?</i>

27:52.884 --> 27:55.051
<i>What did the policeman
say to the snowman?</i>

27:55.184 --> 27:56.851
<i>Yeah. Freeze.</i>

27:56.984 --> 27:59.650
<i>Why did the princess
not get her photos?</i>

27:59.784 --> 28:02.517
<i>Why did the princess
not get her photos?</i>

28:02.650 --> 28:05.250
<i>Cos she never got her prints.</i>

28:05.383 --> 28:06.951
<i>It wasn't my Mummy's car.</i>

28:07.084 --> 28:09.484
<i>It looked like it,
but it was too clean.</i>

30:35.951 --> 30:37.784
Everything OK?

30:37.917 --> 30:39.118
Chris?

30:39.250 --> 30:43.851
- How are you?
- Hi. Erm, is that Megan's?

30:43.984 --> 30:46.650
- I don't want it getting wet.
- Probably meant for the bin.

30:46.784 --> 30:49.350
- It's the rain.
- I'll have to have a word.

30:49.484 --> 30:50.917
The shite she writes in these.

30:51.051 --> 30:54.317
Same problem
with her last school.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.017
- Thank you. Cheers.
- No problem.

30:56.151 --> 30:57.984
All right. Bye-bye.

31:30.984 --> 31:32.784
Can you leave it be now?

31:38.917 --> 31:40.817
Come here, you nut.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.383
Come here.

31:53.017 --> 31:54.650
I need you to...

31:58.017 --> 31:59.417
help me.

31:59.550 --> 32:03.084
It gets in there
and it just... won't go away.

32:03.218 --> 32:05.517
I know. I know.

32:07.851 --> 32:11.017
- I think I'm going nuts.
- No, you're not going nuts.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.250
All right?

32:18.417 --> 32:22.584
- You all right?
- I know. Eejit.

32:26.851 --> 32:29.317
We both miss our wee birdy.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.350
Sorry, birdy.

33:24.084 --> 33:26.684
We should go up
and get the... get the wetsuits.

33:26.817 --> 33:29.218
Wetsuits and boogie boards
this time.

33:29.350 --> 33:31.550
But not before
you get on that big ride.

33:31.684 --> 33:35.484
Oh, the big dipper.
That's the one. The big dipper.

33:35.617 --> 33:36.851
What are youse doing?

33:36.984 --> 33:39.917
Megan,
you're not allowed up here.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.784
Chris. Hey.

33:41.917 --> 33:45.650
We're having a wee party,
if you wanna come over.

33:45.784 --> 33:46.984
Come on.

33:47.118 --> 33:49.951
Er... Do you want to?

33:50.084 --> 33:51.784
Pretty good fire.

33:53.984 --> 33:56.417
So what made youse move here?

33:56.550 --> 33:58.584
Ach, you know. A change.

33:58.717 --> 34:01.817
Yeah. I know what you mean.

34:01.951 --> 34:05.350
We had the house on the market.
We couldn't get it sold.

34:07.184 --> 34:11.484
I thought a move would
fix everything, but, you know...

34:12.951 --> 34:15.884
Well, some things
just can't be fixed.

34:16.817 --> 34:20.516
Doesn't mean
you should stop trying.

34:23.550 --> 34:24.917
We should get you to value it.

34:25.051 --> 34:29.449
Look, I'm just secretarial.
But I could ask.

34:34.382 --> 34:37.250
Will someone play
with me? I'm dying of neglect!

34:38.884 --> 34:43.217
- I am the god of hellfire.
- And I bring you...

34:43.350 --> 34:45.417
You're mad.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.449
- It's a song.
- Right.

34:48.583 --> 34:51.016
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

34:51.150 --> 34:54.583
You introduced me to it.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.051
- You're going down.
- No, I'm not. Uh-uh.

34:57.184 --> 34:59.151
It's easier
if you use two hands.

34:59.283 --> 35:03.084
Great! Oh. Whoa, whoa!
Damn, I am... Jesus!

36:38.951 --> 36:40.884
Show.

36:41.517 --> 36:42.650
It's not deep.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.450
Here.

36:45.184 --> 36:46.751
Does it hurt?

36:46.884 --> 36:47.884
No. No.

36:52.484 --> 36:53.984
Hold it there.

37:15.851 --> 37:17.751
One of these weeks,
you'll remember yourself.

37:17.884 --> 37:20.550
- Yeah, thanks.
- Hey. Do you want a lift?

37:20.684 --> 37:22.151
No. I'm going home with Connor.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.350
Well, you're welcome, son.

37:29.684 --> 37:32.417
Can I come back with you?

37:33.884 --> 37:35.650
No, love.

37:35.784 --> 37:37.984
Please! Mum won't pick up.

37:38.684 --> 37:40.584
Well, call her again.

37:47.218 --> 37:49.283
Can we go to the park?

37:51.584 --> 37:53.051
I'd better just get you home.

37:53.184 --> 37:57.884
Please! Mum and Chris
never take me to the park.

37:58.017 --> 37:59.684
Do they not?

37:59.817 --> 38:02.383
They never have time.

38:02.517 --> 38:05.717
Well... Well, yeah, we'll see.
OK?

38:06.484 --> 38:07.450
Just quick, though.

38:07.584 --> 38:09.717
"We'll see" always means yes.

38:50.450 --> 38:51.817
When we came here before,

38:51.951 --> 38:54.717
I was too small
for these, wasn't I?

38:57.951 --> 38:59.617
You've had your two minutes.

38:59.751 --> 39:00.984
You've never been here before.

39:01.118 --> 39:03.951
- We have!
- We haven't.

39:04.084 --> 39:05.851
We have.

39:06.984 --> 39:08.283
You're lying.

39:08.417 --> 39:09.917
We had a picnic.

39:10.051 --> 39:12.250
You're thinking of a wee park
your mam took you to

39:12.383 --> 39:15.084
- when you were little.
- No, I'm not.

39:15.218 --> 39:16.350
Yes, you are. You're lying.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.184
We came here.

39:18.317 --> 39:20.417
Megan.

39:21.283 --> 39:22.383
Stop it.

39:22.517 --> 39:25.184
There was a yellow thing.
A fish.

39:25.317 --> 39:26.584
I loved the yellow thing

39:26.717 --> 39:28.984
cos I was too small
for the monkey bars.

39:37.051 --> 39:39.084
God, stop it. Come on.

39:39.218 --> 39:40.218
Just once more.

39:40.350 --> 39:42.417
- Get in the car.
- No!

39:42.550 --> 39:44.350
- Get in the car.
- No!

39:44.484 --> 39:46.684
- Get in the car, Megan.
- No!

39:46.817 --> 39:48.917
Get in the car!

39:49.051 --> 39:50.884
Jesus Christ.

40:16.484 --> 40:18.417
I'll get it.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.851
- Is your mother in?
- Yeah.

40:33.317 --> 40:34.417
- Uh-huh.
- Hi.

40:34.550 --> 40:36.717
Everything OK?

40:36.851 --> 40:39.751
Sorry, but, I...

40:39.884 --> 40:43.250
I'd rather you didn't give
my daughter lifts any more.

40:43.383 --> 40:44.584
Sorry?

40:44.717 --> 40:45.917
I'd rather
you didn't give her lifts.

40:46.051 --> 40:48.584
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

40:48.717 --> 40:50.283
I only ever gave her
the one lift

40:50.417 --> 40:52.450
and that's cos
you left her standing.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.784
- I did not leave her standing.
- It was after three.

40:54.917 --> 40:56.784
- It wasn't after three.
- It was after three.

40:56.917 --> 40:59.684
All right, Laura. Er, I didn't
wanna make a thing out of it.

40:59.817 --> 41:02.550
- That's all I wanted to say.
- A thing?

41:02.684 --> 41:05.484
- Sorry if it seemed...
- Rude?

41:05.617 --> 41:07.151
- Fine, fine.
- For Christ's sake.

41:07.283 --> 41:09.051
What?

41:09.184 --> 41:12.684
Look, I don't know...
What's the problem?

41:12.817 --> 41:15.151
- You. There's no need...
- I've my own family, thanks.

41:15.283 --> 41:16.617
- Exactly.
- What do you mean?

41:16.751 --> 41:19.684
- I'm just trying to say that...
- Piss off!

41:19.817 --> 41:21.450
Oi!

41:21.584 --> 41:22.951
Just leave us alone, please.

41:23.084 --> 41:25.350
- Leave youse alone?
- Marie, leave it.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.350
- All right, piss off yourself!
- Tadhg!

41:27.484 --> 41:28.684
Stay out of it!

41:28.817 --> 41:31.851
Just stay away, right?

42:00.550 --> 42:03.250
Let's get away.
A few days.

42:29.484 --> 42:30.917
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

42:31.051 --> 42:32.884
Watch the master.

43:37.784 --> 43:39.851
Night-night, you big shite.

44:58.817 --> 45:00.584
I miss you.

46:51.051 --> 46:53.617
<i>It's quite chilly</i>

46:53.751 --> 46:56.084
<i>it has to be said,
with a risk of frost.</i>

46:56.218 --> 46:59.917
<i>Now, today has been another day
when we've been able to watch</i>

47:00.051 --> 47:02.684
<i>the worst of the cloudy weather
pass to the south</i>

47:02.817 --> 47:05.517
<i>because the main area of rain
has actually moved,</i>

47:05.650 --> 47:07.917
<i>but there's another weather
front up to the north.</i>

47:08.051 --> 47:11.417
<i>Indeed, a cold front and that
is going to bring patchy...</i>

47:14.184 --> 47:16.250
Mum, open the car.

47:20.884 --> 47:23.617
Mum.

47:31.517 --> 47:33.550
See you later, Megan.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.784
Hi, sweetheart!

47:35.917 --> 47:37.984
Hi. Do you want to come
to the car for one wee sec?

47:38.118 --> 47:39.984
- I want to show you something.
- What?

47:40.118 --> 47:43.617
I don't wanna tell you.
It'll just be a wee sec.

47:43.751 --> 47:46.417
I'm supposed to be in school.

47:47.851 --> 47:49.383
- Mum!
- What did I say?

47:49.517 --> 47:51.417
You said
you only wanted to talk to her.

47:51.550 --> 47:53.884
- That's right.
- Mum, stop it!

48:13.317 --> 48:15.584
- Ready for the lion's den?
- Oh.

48:16.517 --> 48:17.951
Sorry.

48:19.650 --> 48:20.984
It's so good of you

48:21.118 --> 48:22.884
to come in every year
and speak to the kids.

48:23.017 --> 48:27.784
Oh, no, it's important to me.
Anyway, it gets me off work.

48:49.317 --> 48:52.283
- <i>Sorry, my daughter...</i>
- <i>Forgot her lunch?</i>

48:52.417 --> 48:53.851
<i>Leave it over there.</i>

48:53.984 --> 48:55.751
- I'll make sure she gets it.
- Fab! Thanks.

48:55.884 --> 48:59.717
With the rest of Year Sixes?
Great. Thank you.

49:10.151 --> 49:15.784
Who here can tell me
what "caution" means?

49:15.917 --> 49:17.317
Yes?

49:17.450 --> 49:20.250
Erm, is it like a cold?

49:21.184 --> 49:22.717
A cold?

49:26.650 --> 49:30.984
Erm, no. No, it's not a cold.
Anyone else?

49:32.350 --> 49:36.984
So, erm,
caution means to take care.

49:37.118 --> 49:38.550
Now, here in Northern Ireland,

49:38.684 --> 49:42.517
we have some of the highest,
erm, road-death rates

49:42.650 --> 49:46.617
in all of Europe, so...

49:50.017 --> 49:50.917
Erm...

49:51.051 --> 49:53.417
What we have here...

49:55.684 --> 49:57.984
Erm... So, it's, erm...

50:15.417 --> 50:18.317
Have you been here before,
Megan?

50:19.917 --> 50:22.417
The birds
on the telegraph wire...

50:23.051 --> 50:24.383
Are they crows?

50:26.784 --> 50:28.350
I dunno.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.584
You can see them
from upside down

50:39.717 --> 50:42.484
when you're in the front seat
looking up.

50:43.417 --> 50:45.350
What?

50:47.817 --> 50:49.283
The crows.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.283
Oh.

51:03.951 --> 51:04.917
Ow!

51:05.051 --> 51:06.817
What?

51:19.184 --> 51:20.717
He was singing.

51:25.884 --> 51:27.450
Who?

51:29.218 --> 51:31.283
Brendan was.

51:50.283 --> 51:51.617
- Shut up, OK? Shut up!
- Ow!

52:11.984 --> 52:13.784
Sorry, Brendy.

52:16.017 --> 52:17.751
It was a mistake.

52:24.484 --> 52:26.984
Right, thanks, mate.

52:32.317 --> 52:33.917
All right?

52:43.051 --> 52:44.583
What's wrong?

52:48.817 --> 52:50.283
Laura?

52:51.751 --> 52:53.951
Right. Right, we have
to do something about this.

52:54.084 --> 52:56.450
- They can't just move in here.
- Brendan, Brendan.

52:56.584 --> 52:58.884
- No, it's not on!
- This is about Josie.

52:59.017 --> 53:01.383
What? How is this...?
How is this about Josie?

53:01.517 --> 53:02.917
I've been trying to tell you.

53:03.051 --> 53:05.550
What have you
been trying to tell me?

53:14.151 --> 53:15.984
Laura, what did you do?

53:20.984 --> 53:22.517
Laura?

53:23.283 --> 53:25.851
I took Megan for a wee drive.

53:27.650 --> 53:30.917
Oh, fuck. Where's Tadhg?

53:31.051 --> 53:32.817
Upstairs.

53:35.884 --> 53:37.817
Laura...

53:37.951 --> 53:42.184
We both miss Josie.
We all miss Josie.

53:42.317 --> 53:46.417
But Megan is not Josie,
all right?

53:47.317 --> 53:48.917
How do you know?

53:51.516 --> 53:55.484
- How can you be sure?
- Cos this is real life!

53:55.617 --> 53:58.784
You're starting to worry me now.
She's doing this to you.

53:58.917 --> 53:59.984
- Who?
- Marie.

54:00.118 --> 54:02.517
- No.
- Then what? What?

54:06.484 --> 54:08.584
She said you were singing.

54:12.317 --> 54:14.151
I took her along
the Ballyfield Road

54:14.317 --> 54:17.084
and she didn't recognise it,
so...

54:17.218 --> 54:19.317
I turned around...

54:19.450 --> 54:21.417
in the direction
you'd have been travelling.

54:21.550 --> 54:23.751
You took a child
to the Ballyfield Road?

54:23.884 --> 54:25.317
Were you singing?

54:27.717 --> 54:30.650
Laura...
Laura, what is this here?

54:30.784 --> 54:33.051
- She knows places we went.
- What are you doing? Kidnapping?

54:33.184 --> 54:35.917
She knows places we went,
places Josie went.

54:36.051 --> 54:37.550
Josie? Josie's dead, Laura!

54:37.684 --> 54:39.350
- I know Josie's dead!
- She's dead!

54:39.484 --> 54:40.984
I know Josie's dead!

54:41.118 --> 54:42.951
I know! I know!

54:45.650 --> 54:48.984
She wrote Tadhg's her brother
in her wee journal.

54:55.784 --> 54:57.951
Love...

54:58.084 --> 55:02.884
I understand that I sound crazy
cos I can hear myself.

55:08.617 --> 55:10.851
Darling, you have to choose.

55:12.517 --> 55:14.684
Me and Tadhg or here.

55:15.383 --> 55:17.283
But...

55:18.417 --> 55:20.484
were you singing?

55:27.784 --> 55:28.984
Yes.

55:41.084 --> 55:43.817
I mean, we can't ignore it.
We can't.

55:46.751 --> 55:49.817
We can't lose her again.
We can't lose her twice.

55:54.484 --> 55:56.784
I never told you,

55:56.917 --> 55:58.550
but I was standing
in the corridor

55:58.684 --> 56:00.584
when they brought youse in.

56:05.517 --> 56:07.684
I didn't know at first...

56:08.517 --> 56:10.884
for 20 minutes it was her.

56:15.484 --> 56:17.617
And I prayed, Brendan.

56:23.084 --> 56:25.951
I fell on my knees and prayed...

56:30.584 --> 56:32.684
that she'd come back to me.

56:42.151 --> 56:43.717
Laura...

56:46.250 --> 56:47.650
Laura.

56:47.784 --> 56:50.484
Bastard! I hate you!

56:53.784 --> 56:55.550
You're lucky there's laws
or I'd break your neck!

56:55.684 --> 56:57.350
- Fucking dickhead!
- Don't be cheeky!

56:57.484 --> 57:01.084
- You psycho!
- Lay a finger on him!

57:01.218 --> 57:02.417
Come here. What's going on?

57:02.550 --> 57:03.951
What were you trying to do? Huh?

57:04.084 --> 57:06.118
I want her to admit
she's making it up.

57:06.250 --> 57:07.884
Right, come on.
Are you all right?

57:08.017 --> 57:09.851
You come
within a hair's breadth...

57:09.984 --> 57:12.017
Listen to the big man,
threatening a 14-year-old!

57:12.151 --> 57:14.984
- Who attacked a ten-year-old.
- Almost 11!

57:15.118 --> 57:16.584
Inside.

57:16.717 --> 57:18.184
What's wrong with you, mate?

57:18.317 --> 57:19.917
Always looking
down your nose at people.

57:20.051 --> 57:22.851
- You're only proving me right.
- Chris, Tadhg will apologise.

57:22.984 --> 57:26.383
- No, I won't!
- That's not gonna fix anything.

57:26.517 --> 57:27.851
She's only a wee girl.

57:27.984 --> 57:30.784
I know. I had a wee girl.
That's exactly it!

57:30.917 --> 57:33.851
Laura, Laura. Come on, you take
him in, darling. Come on.

57:33.984 --> 57:35.283
No, I don't want to!

57:35.417 --> 57:37.417
Look, do as you're told, Tadhg.
Come on, son.

57:37.550 --> 57:38.717
Mum thinks Megan is...

57:38.851 --> 57:40.383
Tadhg, listen,
do as you're told.

57:40.517 --> 57:42.884
She has the life frightened
out of her.

57:43.017 --> 57:45.250
- Marie, Marie, please.
- Huh?

57:45.383 --> 57:47.184
Get in. Keep it down. Come on.

57:47.317 --> 57:49.450
She told me how Josie died.

57:49.584 --> 57:51.650
- She told me how Josie died.
- No, don't...

57:51.784 --> 57:54.517
- What did she say?
- Marie.

57:54.650 --> 57:57.218
Get in. Shut up, please. Listen.

57:57.350 --> 57:59.984
Er, look, we're sorry about
what happened to your wee girl.

58:00.118 --> 58:02.017
But you have to stay away
from Megan.

58:02.151 --> 58:05.617
I'm being fucking serious.
Stay the fuck away from her.

58:13.517 --> 58:15.684
She won't let me.

58:31.650 --> 58:34.317
What were you doing next door?

58:36.151 --> 58:37.617
Son?

58:39.184 --> 58:42.717
- What were you doing next door?
- It's me youse want.

58:43.283 --> 58:45.017
I, erm...

58:46.484 --> 58:48.417
Our daughter died.

58:48.550 --> 58:50.450
I was driving the car.

58:52.617 --> 58:54.751
When was this?

58:55.550 --> 58:57.484
It was icy and...

58:59.017 --> 59:02.250
Does this have
a bearing on tonight?

59:06.417 --> 59:09.250
What were you doing next door?

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:06.350
I can't hack this any more.

01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:10.884
What?

01:01:18.784 --> 01:01:20.851
It's just a few days.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.383
Thank you.

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:32.684
- I could take Tadhg with me.
- He has school.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.851
Look, I...

01:01:39.383 --> 01:01:41.550
I don't think
I should leave you.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:47.317
- I guess...
- I just need some space.

01:01:50.617 --> 01:01:52.617
He's safe with me.

01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:09.250
<i>If you love someone...</i>

01:03:10.283 --> 01:03:12.283
<i>you hurt.</i>

01:03:14.151 --> 01:03:16.584
<i>So much it feels impossible.</i>

01:03:18.584 --> 01:03:21.283
<i>But she's here.
She's always been here.</i>

01:03:26.817 --> 01:03:28.984
<i>She'll help us through this.</i>

01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:38.017
<i>Talk to me, love.</i>

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:54.417
God's sake. Brendan, come here.

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:58.584
Look, it must have got
in the window.

01:04:01.317 --> 01:04:03.851
Thanks for the boots.
They're class.

01:04:05.917 --> 01:04:07.184
You're welcome.

01:04:07.317 --> 01:04:10.450
And don't tell your mammy
cos we'll get in trouble.

01:04:18.084 --> 01:04:19.951
You're a good wee girl.

01:05:05.517 --> 01:05:06.851
<i>..took on the chaos.</i>

01:05:06.984 --> 01:05:08.784
<i>What have you done
to this house, Kirsty?</i>

01:05:08.917 --> 01:05:11.884
<i>Ah, what haven't
I done? That's the question.</i>

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:15.051
I wanna see Dad.

01:05:15.184 --> 01:05:17.317
You'll see him Saturday.

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:19.550
I hate you! You're nuts!

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.851
Tadhg!

01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:25.383
Tadhg!

01:05:27.118 --> 01:05:28.450
Tadhg!

01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:30.218
<i>So, are you going to love it?</i>

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:32.184
<i>Or list it?</i>

01:05:32.317 --> 01:05:34.017
Tadhg.

01:05:36.417 --> 01:05:38.017
Come on.

01:05:39.051 --> 01:05:40.450
Please. Tadhg?

01:05:48.584 --> 01:05:50.317
- Craig?
- Here.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.951
Yeah. Aoife?

01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:55.383
- Good. Jackson?
- Here.

01:05:55.517 --> 01:05:57.383
OK. Megan?

01:06:00.218 --> 01:06:01.951
Megan?

01:08:44.517 --> 01:08:46.649
How'd you get my number?

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:57.450
Did you get it?

01:08:58.118 --> 01:08:59.783
Get what?

01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:04.250
My letter.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.716
Jesus.

01:09:22.317 --> 01:09:25.617
Megan... stop pretending.

01:09:25.751 --> 01:09:27.649
I'm not. I thought I was her,
but I'm not!

01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:30.517
- Stop it!
- You can't shout at me!

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:32.617
- Why did you say those things?
- To make her happy.

01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:35.350
- You're a wee liar!
- You have nice dinners and...

01:09:35.484 --> 01:09:37.649
Wee liar!

01:09:44.984 --> 01:09:47.517
Shit, shit, shit.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.051
What's wrong?

01:09:56.184 --> 01:09:57.584
Tadhg, what's wrong?

01:10:00.484 --> 01:10:01.984
Here, boy.

01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:05.484
Let me see.

01:10:05.617 --> 01:10:07.650
Tadhg, let me see.

01:10:08.317 --> 01:10:09.951
Let me see, please.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.383
I found these.

01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:27.550
Oh... Where's your mum?

01:10:28.617 --> 01:10:31.484
<i>Where do you think she's going?</i>

01:10:40.617 --> 01:10:42.784
Laura's not my mummy.

01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:46.283
But you're my daddy,
aren't you?

01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:48.283
What?

01:12:25.484 --> 01:12:28.317
<i>Mum, where are you?</i>

01:12:30.317 --> 01:12:32.151
I really like Laura.

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:35.917
OK.

01:13:51.316 --> 01:13:52.851
Chris?

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.550
Why did you come here?

01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:07.617
I...

01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:12.984
Look, Laura,
it got out of hand.

01:14:13.118 --> 01:14:15.484
- You used your child?
- What?

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.350
- To hurt him?
- I didn't.

01:14:17.484 --> 01:14:18.917
You fucking psychopath.

01:14:19.051 --> 01:14:20.517
I didn't plan it.

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:22.084
You moved in next door.

01:14:22.218 --> 01:14:24.717
And that was stupid, but
everything else just happened.

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:26.383
I told her
to stay away from you.

01:14:26.517 --> 01:14:28.383
- Bullshit!
- But this was never...

01:14:28.517 --> 01:14:29.884
I didn't know about Josie.

01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:31.984
What is wrong with you?

01:14:32.118 --> 01:14:33.317
Is Mum with you?

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:36.084
Go back to the house.

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:38.784
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:42.650
I wanted him to know her!
I wanted him to know her.

01:14:42.784 --> 01:14:45.151
He vanished and I was barely 20.

01:14:45.283 --> 01:14:46.751
You want to destroy us?

01:14:49.517 --> 01:14:52.650
You used your wee girl.
I'll have her taken off you.

01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:56.684
You're not fit...
You are not fit to be a mother!

01:14:56.817 --> 01:14:58.884
And you made me think
that I'm fucking crazy!

01:14:59.017 --> 01:15:01.017
You're not gonna mess
that girl up!

01:15:01.151 --> 01:15:04.383
- I will make sure of it!
- Oh, you are fucking crazy!

01:15:04.517 --> 01:15:07.017
Laura, you can't replace her.

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:23.851
Sorry.

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:27.450
I'll never get her back.

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:53.484
Are you OK?

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:56.383
Laura?

01:16:05.383 --> 01:16:07.817
Come on!

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.751
<i>Laura, I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.</i>

01:16:13.884 --> 01:16:15.951
<i>So many times, I wanted
to tell you, but I was scared.</i>

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:19.751
<i>I was hurt.
It was nothing to do with you.</i>

01:16:19.884 --> 01:16:21.751
<i>I was scared
of hurting you.</i>

01:16:21.884 --> 01:16:23.684
<i>I couldn't hurt you, Laura.
Please.</i>

01:16:23.817 --> 01:16:27.517
<i>Please, darling. I didn't want
for any of this to happen.</i>

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:29.717
<i>Josie? Josie.</i>

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:32.383
- <i>A stupid mistake.</i>
- <i>I know he's late.</i>

01:16:32.517 --> 01:16:34.218
<i>I tried to bury it.</i>

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.984
<i>I tried. I wanted to. I tried.</i>

01:16:36.118 --> 01:16:37.317
<i>Josie, look.</i>

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:39.951
<i>I couldn't...</i>

01:16:40.084 --> 01:16:42.717
<i>But I never, ever
expected her to...</i>

01:16:42.851 --> 01:16:44.751
<i>Look at your face.</i>

01:16:46.218 --> 01:16:49.317
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>My wee girl.</i>

01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:51.417
<i>I love you.</i>

01:16:56.784 --> 01:16:57.851
I'm sorry.

01:17:06.617 --> 01:17:08.650
It's OK, darling.

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:15.383
It's OK.

01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:32.684
<i>Alison Hammond</i>

01:17:32.817 --> 01:17:35.484
<i>was on the "Scott Mills Show"
yesterday. Incredible.</i>

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:38.984
<i>She told the story of when she
blagged her way into a party.</i>

01:17:39.118 --> 01:17:40.951
<i>Me and Richard
got into this party.</i>

01:17:41.084 --> 01:17:43.884
<i>We were living it up.
There was drinks...</i>

01:18:10.751 --> 01:18:12.817
<i>If you love someone...</i>

01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:15.817
<i>you hurt.</i>

01:18:38.717 --> 01:18:40.550
<i>She's here.</i>

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.751
<i>She's always been here.</i>
