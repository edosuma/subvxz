WEBVTT

00:43.280 --> 00:47.501
PRUDIE: The old grey duck,
she stole her nest

00:47.680 --> 00:51.138
And laid up in the fields
THOLLY: ..in the fields

00:51.320 --> 00:55.097
PRUDIE: And when the young ones,
they came forth

00:55.280 --> 00:58.784
They had no tails nor bills

00:59.200 --> 01:03.227
They had no tails, nor bills...
- What's that, out there?

01:04.120 --> 01:05.587
- Th...
- What?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.739
PRUDIE: Be they ours?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.299
French.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.827
Lord, save us.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.824
PRUDIE: Attack. Attack!

01:24.000 --> 01:29.142
The Frenchies are coming! Ring a bell!
The Frenchies are coming!

01:29.320 --> 01:32.585
- Attack! The Frenchies are coming!
- (Bell clangs)

01:32.760 --> 01:34.421
The Frenchies are coming!

01:34.600 --> 01:37.023
- The Frenchies are coming!
- (Panicked shouting)

01:38.120 --> 01:40.680
(Church bell ringing)

01:42.040 --> 01:45.020
(Shouting and bell ringing)

01:48.560 --> 01:51.461
The Frenchies are coming!
They're coming!

01:51.640 --> 01:53.619
The Frenchies are coming...

01:55.840 --> 01:57.740
(Excited chatter)

02:01.160 --> 02:02.980
(Crowd falls silent)

02:03.160 --> 02:05.025
(Muttering)

02:05.200 --> 02:08.704
PRUDIE: Where have they gone?
- They'll be spying out our defences.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.303
But...they'll be back.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.301
SIR FRANCIS: This threat from the French
cannot be ignored.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.349
Cornwall is woefully unprepared
for an enemy which is now at our door.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.067
Those men with military experience

02:24.240 --> 02:26.879
will form and train
companies of volunteers

02:27.040 --> 02:31.704
to quell threat and disorder
wherever it appears.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.304
When the hour comes - and come it will -

02:35.480 --> 02:37.186
we must not be found wanting.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.022
(Muttering)

02:40.200 --> 02:42.100
Truro is a key location.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.259
(Low chatter)

03:04.960 --> 03:08.259
HUGH: ’Tfs/Ie} whom I desire,
would stoop to /0 ve me,

03:09.800 --> 03:12.223
I would come hand in hand
and knee/mg,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.379
ask that she kind/y receive me. . .

03:16.080 --> 03:18.344
...and de/yn to understand

03:18.520 --> 03:22.707
that a I have is hers,
forever and a day.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.785
Press but her l/,'os to mine" .

03:28.120 --> 03:30.099
. . .and never let love decay. ”

03:37.120 --> 03:39.827
ROSS: You should not be here alone.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.465
The French have been sighted.
There's rumours of invasion.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.701
No doubt you'll take up the flag
and lead the charge against them.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.020
And become a leader of men.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.577
I happen to agree with Sir Francis.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.457
I've seen what chaos revolution brings
and I do not wish that on Cornwall.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.257
GEOFFREY CHARLES:
I intend to visit Drake, Mama.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.388
My love,
as
you know, I've no objection
to your visiting Mr Came.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.337
He has a respectable trade
and you seem fond of him.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.944
But delay awhile. Uncle George
returns from Westminster today

04:16.120 --> 04:18.907
and I know he'd wish us
to spend some time with him.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.305
(Steam hisses)

04:50.200 --> 04:51.269
(Hammering)

04:51.440 --> 04:54.079
- (He giggles)
- Yes.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.138
Remember what we agreed, my love.
Uncle George...

05:01.320 --> 05:04.869
Is a kind and generous man,
who only wishes to be a good father to me.

05:05.040 --> 05:09.227
- Even though what he did to Drake was...
- Was wrong and I'm sure he regrets it.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.427
But if you and he quarrel,
it will distress me beyond words.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.023
For your sake, Mama, I'll be civil.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.062
The old smithy on the edge
of Trenwith land - who owns it now?

05:28.240 --> 05:31.061
I believe Ross purchased it
for his brother-in-law.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.219
And very splendid it is.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.699
You permit him to visit?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.939
Yes. That was my decision.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.747
What harm can it do?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.866
Morwenna is wed. Geoffrey Charles
will soon return to school.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.224
How is Drake Came in any way a threat?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.949
The smithy is adjacent to my land.
It's deliberate provocation by Ross.

06:04.440 --> 06:10.219
My dear, must we forever be imagining
some Trenwith-Nampara feud?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.187
I doubt Ross wastes a moment
thinking of us,

06:13.360 --> 06:15.385
so I suggest we do likewise.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.819
I trust you've suffered...
no insolence from him since I left?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.903
I can't remember the last time I saw him.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.106
Come, my dear,
you must be weary from yourjourney.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.661
I am, indeed.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.099
It's good to be home.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.187
It is not his home!

06:51.360 --> 06:54.579
It's a Poldark house and he is a usurper.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.139
Let him be, Master Geoffrey.
He can't touch you here.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.778
No, he cannot. Mama says I may visit
and I shall do so every day.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.218
Drake Came has had the impudence
to set up shop on my boundary.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.858
Tonight, you'll begin to show him
how unwise that was.

07:10.040 --> 07:15.239
You will find ways of ensuring
his residence there is of short duration.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.539
Rely on me, sir.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.179
Good boy.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.501
(Tapping)

07:54.000 --> 07:56.343
DWIGHT: Following my last visit,
I'm pleased to say,

07:56.520 --> 08:00.104
- Mrs Whitworth continues to improve.
OSSIE: Ah, yes, indeed. God be praised.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.387
Though I would recommend...
a further period of abstinence.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.461
_ - Of course.
- I'm relieved to hear you say so.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.200
But if I might suggest,
some more of that helpful tincture,

08:10.360 --> 08:13.022
to ensure her rest is undisturbed.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.145
If Mrs Whitworth has no objection?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.659
As you wish.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.140
My clear, why not rest awhile,

08:34.320 --> 08:37.426
before you enjoy my first sermon
at Sawle Church this afternoon?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.579
I will bring you your sedative.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.459
That's kind of you, Ossie.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.460
Mm.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.744
(Muffled grunts and cries of pleasure)

09:20.800 --> 09:23.780
So, I'm thinking of moving
the family home to London.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.865
Why?

09:27.040 --> 09:31.386
If the French invade, there's no telling
how this house or our bank,

09:31.560 --> 09:33.619
or our grain stores, might be ransacked.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.142
We must protect ourselves.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.062
Whilst abandoning
our tenants and servants?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.741
Every man for himself.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.582
I suspect Sir Francis
might disagree with you.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.220
Present your firelocks!

10:02.400 --> 10:04.379
Order your firelocks!

10:07.920 --> 10:12.027
Couldn't pay me to enlist.
You're naught but a puppet.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.859
Gentlemen, you have responded to the call
to maintain order and defend your country.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.107
You are under my command.
You will obey my orders.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.785
If you find this unacceptable...
now is the moment to depart.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.900
GEORGE
Ross
Poldark.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.140
I must ask you, is he the right man?

10:40.200 --> 10:44.148
In view of his recklessness, lawlessness,
previous contempt for authority.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.424
l-le
/s
the authority.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.500
And what is his remit?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.706
To quell threat and disorder
wherever it appears.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.707
And can he be trusted
to carry out your Instructions?

10:57.880 --> 11:01.145
More to the point, can you?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.106
In your first term at Westminster,
you voted against a bid

11:05.280 --> 11:07.987
to increase the legal rights
of commoners.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.027
You have challenged all proposals
for lowering interest rates

11:11.200 --> 11:13.839
and opposed a bill
for enforcing a fixed price for grain.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.300
- I'm voting according to my conscience.
- You have ignored our explicit agreement!

11:19.520 --> 11:23.502
Meanwhile, you conspire with other
grain merchants to keep prices high,

11:23.680 --> 11:27.867
despite the failed harvest
and recent rioting.

11:38.800 --> 11:43.021
If unrest should again rear its ugly head,

11:43.200 --> 11:47.261
it is comforting to know
that a hero is on hand to save us.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.505
OSSIE: And finally, Lord,
thank you for granting your humble servant

12:03.680 --> 12:05.466
the living of St Sawle.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.461
Further parishes
would be most gratefully received.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.665
Amen.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.105
Vicar, I have some disquieting news.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.821
I'm with child.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.979
(She sobs)

12:20.840 --> 12:23.946
I waited and waited
to be sure there's no mistake.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.986
There is no mistake.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.062
- Dear God.
- What shall we do?

12:31.240 --> 12:33.504
"W—e"?
- Perhaps I should run away.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.057
- Might you?
- No, you're right.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.344
We must face this together.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.659
I came to report, sir.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.400
Spare me the details.
Is the matter handled?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.187
Well and truly, sir.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.019
That's all I need to know.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.985
Drake!

13:06.160 --> 13:08.025
Must have happened in the night.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.942
- Judas! Who would do such a thing?
- Nay, it is not all.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.906
This day already, four folks sent word

13:13.080 --> 13:15.822
saying they'd not be needing
my services more.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.025
Yet, I must carry on.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.186
Nay, your work is good, your price fair.
You've made no enemies.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.664
I bet it's George. Up to his old tricks again,
getting at Drake to get at you.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.944
George is a Member of Parliament.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.669
He could hardly risk his reputation
by harassing a lowly blacksmith.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.899
And, besides, Elizabeth
would never permit such behaviour.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.349
- You know that for a fact?
- I know Elizabeth.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.377
Shall I answer as a friend,
or a physician?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.980
Which will tell me
what I most want to hear?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.264
There is no kindness in giving false hope.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.700
So I must surrender?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.018
My vision and...

14:21.880 --> 14:24.144
...my heart's desire?

14:25.400 --> 14:28.107
The later you never possessed,
nor ever could.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.839
So, what do you prescribe, my friend?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.979
Acceptance.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.984
(Door closes)

14:50.800 --> 14:52.381
Satisfied, are 'ee?

14:52.560 --> 14:54.425
I could wish my rum was less depleted.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.740
Stand by, hm, while high and mighty
set their ruffians on the meek?

14:59.920 --> 15:04.857
If it is George,
confrontation and aggression is fruitless.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.497
He will deny it and we have no proof.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.819
All we can hope
is he will soon become bored

15:10.000 --> 15:12.457
and find some other innocent to torment.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.667
Is that what we hope? Some other victim
so we can say, Naught to do with we."

15:16.840 --> 15:22.426
Demelza, this week there were
three French ships on the horizon.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.342
I may soon have a real battle to fight.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.659
Spare me this one.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.745
I think, Vicar,
I may have found a solution.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.699
If I were to marry someone else.

15:52.880 --> 15:57.021
There is a young man - of course,
he does not know of my condition.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.100
Perhaps he would utterly spurn me
if he did.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.864
- Who is this person?
- Arthur Solway, from the library.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.464
- Have you been intimate with him?
- Oh, Vicar, how could you think so?

16:07.880 --> 16:09.859
Then, how can you think he will marry you?

16:10.040 --> 16:12.258
Because he asked me last week.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.067
Ah.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.657
- And he is quite unaware...
- Quite unaware.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.741
- If you marry him, he never need know.
- Of course, he must know.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.866
I'm amazed _
you would even suggest that I lie.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.584
Obviously, I will not tell him
whose child it is.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.739
Might he agree?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.863
I think he could be persuaded.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.224
With the right inducement.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.786
1,000.

16:37.960 --> 16:42.704
Rowella, escort this person from my house
and see that he never returns.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.865
(She pretends to sob)

16:59.000 --> 17:02.879
Do you not think if even the likes of Tholly
grow discontent

17:03.040 --> 17:04.905
and then find they must speak out...

17:05.080 --> 17:07.787
Tholly loves the sound of his own voice.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.381
If you do not challenge
the corrupt and unjust,

17:12.560 --> 17:15.779
then commoners will rise and then
you'll be powerless to help them.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.780
What would you have me do?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.425
I'd have you step up.

17:20.600 --> 17:24.104
I'd have you be great.
I'd have you declare what you stand for.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.023
You would have me pontificate
and play the hero

17:28.200 --> 17:30.384
and make some grand dramatic gesture.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.666
I am not that man, Demelza.
I've never been that man.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.787
And if that's what you seek...
I suggest you look elsewhere.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.419
(Nib scraping against paper)

18:15.880 --> 18:18.337
(Horse whinnying)

18:38.640 --> 18:40.983
(Structure creaking)

18:52.160 --> 18:54.139
(Birdsong)

19:12.200 --> 19:13.986
Mama, may I beg a favour?

19:14.160 --> 19:15.707
What is it, my sweet?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.579
Will you hear what my friend has to say?

19:25.840 --> 19:30.027
(Scoffs) A petition from the people
of Grambler, Sawle and Mellin.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.703
Will I sell them grain
at 30 shillings a bushel?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.097
(Laughs) Are they mad?

19:34.280 --> 19:37.738
Do they not realise my family
has a business to run, expenses to cover?

19:37.920 --> 19:40.946
If the people of Grambler,
Sawle and Mellin cannot afford it,

19:41.120 --> 19:43.099
we will sell it to those who can.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.467
If the landing happens here,

19:46.640 --> 19:49.347
we need to evacuate the cottages
close to the shore

19:49.520 --> 19:51.306
and get the tenants out of harm's way.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.347
If need be,
we have the farm at Mellin to house...

19:54.520 --> 19:56.306
ZACKY: Ross, we have a visitor.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.661
A natural leader.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.662
- What fool told you that?
- Daring, resourceful, courageous.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.900
Courage is often confused
with having nothing to lose.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.822
We have much to lose here
if the French descend.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.458
And if they do,
I trust we will rise to the occasion.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.744
That is my hope, too.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.981
Yet, as we both know,
sometimes when occasion beckons,

20:25.160 --> 20:28.220
the chalice is offered and declined.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.139
Sometimes the chalice is poisoned.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.880
One never knows, until one tries.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.667
My second choice of candidate
had no such scruples.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.907
- George is a first-rate politician.
- I doubt you mean that as a compliment.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.905
Yet the event often proves
the worth of the man.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.621
Cometh the hour.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.420
Are you suggesting that this persecution
is the work of our servants?

21:01.600 --> 21:06.105
Sorry to say so, ma'am.
And I know it must be unbeknown to you.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.625
To me? Are you saying
it is known to Mr Warleggan?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.939
I can't say that, ma'am.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.262
All I do know is Tom Harry
have threatened my customers,

21:15.440 --> 21:19.388
breaked my forge
and set light to my workshop.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.539
What is this man doing here?

21:22.400 --> 21:25.039
- He asked to speak to me and...
- Get out of my house.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.627
I meant no of fence, ma'am.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.463
- None has been taken.
- Now! Before I have you thrown out.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.937
- Why was that upstart here?
- To ask me to intervene on his behalf.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.621
Intervene?

21:56.000 --> 21:59.549
Is it true that you've been attempting
to drive him from his forge?

21:59.720 --> 22:02.826
His presence there
is a deliberate affront by Ross.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.337
And that justifies this harassment?

22:06.520 --> 22:09.546
Wrecking a man's workshop,
threatening his customers?

22:09.720 --> 22:12.700
Good God, I know no details.
I leave the minutiae to Tom Harry.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.586
If the details are beneath you,

22:14.760 --> 22:17.024
is not also the intimidation
of a young man,

22:17.200 --> 22:20.465
whose only crime
is to be related to Ross Poldark?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.744
Drake Came defied me.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.980
He brought toads to our pond.
Whatever Tom saw fit to do...

22:26.160 --> 22:29.903
Tom Harry is a brute
and I want him dismissed.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.742
I want no trouble.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.799
You should have thought about that before
you came trespassing on private property.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.906
I aren't trespassing.
I came to speak to Mrs Warleggan.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.541
Do we believe him? (Chuckles)

22:59.920 --> 23:02.423
All right, lads.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.103
Scat him up.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.061
Tom!

23:39.840 --> 23:42.400
Let's hope your blessed toads
come save 'ee.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.186
I took the liberty, Vicar,
of visiting Arthur,

23:53.360 --> 23:56.067
to see if he would be willing
to accept a smaller sum.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.219
And?

24:04.000 --> 24:07.982
In consideration of the very great
sacrifice I would be making...

24:08.160 --> 24:11.618
to my principles, to my reputation...

24:12.920 --> 24:15.423
...the very least I could accept is 700.

24:17.240 --> 24:21.142
I've pleaded with him, Vicar, but he says
there are things I do not understand.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.426
- We will need a cottage.
- With furnishings.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.306
And a garden.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.301
Perhaps you'd like a carriage, too,
and several footmen?

24:29.480 --> 24:33.143
This is extortion of the grossest kind.
Get out!

24:35.880 --> 24:37.427
(He groans)

24:45.800 --> 24:49.019
- I remember when I first saw you do that.
- A lifetime ago.

24:49.200 --> 24:52.306
I saw you go from raw ensign
and scourge of authority

24:52.480 --> 24:54.186
to able young captain.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.307
You'll also recall
how I earned that promotion

24:59.480 --> 25:02.620
by being the last man standing
after the ambush at James Creek.

25:02.800 --> 25:07.021
One thing remains consistent -
your propensity for self-deprecation.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.907
You're principled and high minded,
but sometimes,

25:10.080 --> 25:13.060
in order to effect change,
hands must be dirtied.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.499
(Seagulls crying)

25:28.120 --> 25:30.099
(He mutters)

25:32.400 --> 25:37.383
Forgive me, Vicar. I wish to let you know
that I've written to the Bishop.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.227
I've asked him to pray for me.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.777
You haven't told him about your condition?

25:43.640 --> 25:48.179
He will never believe you.
He will think you an hysterical child.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.420
I've also mentioned the mole
you have on your left buttock,

25:51.600 --> 25:54.307
shaped like a pig's tail.
It is very distinctive.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.902
I've drawn it for him.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.900
You are the most...evil...

25:58.080 --> 26:03.200
I think, Vicar, that Arthur would be
willing for me to give you this letter...

26:04.840 --> 26:07.661
...in exchange for 500.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.104
(He stifles a groan)

26:13.640 --> 26:15.824
(Whispers) You should never
have let him go.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.218
It was but a courtesy call, he said.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.980
Drake!

26:26.880 --> 26:30.782
- (She groans) Dear God!
- Is he dead?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.747
He's breathing.
He's still breathing! Get help!

26:33.920 --> 26:35.660
Go to Killewarren and fetch Dwight.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.219
(He groans)

26:50.880 --> 26:52.905
You're lucky to be alive.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.347
Who did this?

26:59.800 --> 27:03.145
Can't rightly say.
Never see'd their faces.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.743
It was George's brutes.
Who else would it be?

27:05.920 --> 27:09.344
Then there'll be no recourse.
George will deny all knowledge.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.385
And who can challenge him?

27:11.560 --> 27:13.505
(Drake coughs)

27:14.560 --> 27:18.667
Must we truly stand by, while the rich
and mighty ride roughshod across we?

27:18.840 --> 27:20.705
(Murmuring)

27:20.880 --> 27:22.984
I don't believe God means for I to do it.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.905
Nor I, lad.

27:27.920 --> 27:32.619
To see a young tacker
basted to within an inch of his life.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.586
And none called to answer for it.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.502
And Warleggan a Member of Parliament.

27:37.680 --> 27:41.184
All the more reason for him
and his enterprises to be held to account.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.339
(Murmurs of agreement)

27:44.560 --> 27:46.505
TEﬂme"

27:49.760 --> 27:52.263
- ...tO hit him where it hurts.
- (Murmurs of agreement)

27:57.240 --> 27:59.219
(Birdsong)

28:21.200 --> 28:23.065
When shall we go to London?

28:25.360 --> 28:26.941
Go when you please.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.187
You cannot still be angry...
because of the incident with the boy.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.625
- You surely don't suggest...
- That we're incompatible?

28:39.640 --> 28:43.417
That our marriage is foundering
on suspicion and jealousy?

28:44.440 --> 28:47.705
That your objection to the boy
is really your hatred of Ross?

28:49.960 --> 28:53.339
- I wondered when that name would occur.
- Are you not jealous of hIm?

28:54.360 --> 28:58.262
Is suspicion not eating you up?
Poisoning your family life?

28:58.440 --> 29:01.341
Turning your achievements
to bitterness and gall?

29:02.680 --> 29:06.025
There can be no future for our marriage,
if that is the case.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.579
(Door slams)

29:16.600 --> 29:19.160
Make haste, quiet about it.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.905
That's it. Heave. One, two, three, heave!

29:26.960 --> 29:28.746
Make fast.

29:32.400 --> 29:36.097
Secure it at the back.
Quick about it. Quick about it.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.942
Ready? And heave!

30:13.920 --> 30:16.377
Oh, maid, come home.
There's a visitor.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.300
I can't now. Drake needs me.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.387
Begging your pardon.
It is one I b'la you wish to see.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.017
I can stay and make myself useful.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.505
No, it isn't right, Prudie.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.821
How oft do the men take a fancy
to another woman and sometimes act on it?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.104
I would never.
It would break Ross's heart.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.339
No, I must give up all thoughts of him.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.179
As Ross gave up
all thought of Elizabeth for me.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.907
Did he?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.866
Are you sure?

31:13.640 --> 31:16.780
I only tell you of it
for you know it means naught.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.680
- It is but a dalliance.
- A dalliance?

31:22.720 --> 31:24.585
So...

31:24.760 --> 31:29.106
'ee may have one of your own,
without troubling your conscience.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.819
Go home, Prudie.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.779
(Coos)

31:49.000 --> 31:51.343
Well, my dear...

31:51.520 --> 31:54.421
I trust you are feeling rested
and ready to resume your...

31:54.600 --> 31:56.909
No, Ossie.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.024
My dear, I think you forget yourself.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.829
I come in all friendliness,
intending to give the natural...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.217
I said no.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.180
You will leave this room

32:10.360 --> 32:12.624
and never return.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.264
Can I believe my ears?

32:17.440 --> 32:21.422
Are you so wilful, so headstrong, so...

32:21.600 --> 32:24.706
Blind? No.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.859
Nor half-witted neither.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.065
My sister is with child.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.905
Despite your attempts to sedate me,
I have not been deaf all of the time.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.389
You must realise it was not my fault.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.303
That girl has some evil in her
which makes a man possessed.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.743
But now, by the grace of God,
I have returned to you,

32:55.920 --> 33:01.187
so let us pray together and then...
happily resume our marriage.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.907
Neven

33:06.120 --> 33:09.146
You have no right to deny me.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.461
I am your husband
and you will do as I command.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.619
I will kill your son!

33:20.840 --> 33:25.504
So help me, God, if you do so much
as approach me again, I will smother him.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.706
- Merciful heaven.
- You don't believe I'll do it.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.864
Do you really want to take that chance?

33:37.200 --> 33:39.623
You've been ill, Mon/venna...

33:40.880 --> 33:43.383
...and I have no wish to see you relapse.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.219
I will leave you...

33:46.920 --> 33:49.900
...to think over your duty to me.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.382
I will pray to our Lord
to grant you forgiveness.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.539
(Baby cries)

34:11.600 --> 34:14.467
I didn't mean it.
Of course I didn't mean it.

34:15.640 --> 34:18.302
- But Drake be no harm to anyone.
- It beggars belief.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.345
Had he been found an hour later...

34:20.520 --> 34:22.499
Of course, Demelza asked me
not to tell you.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.500
She's afraid of what I might do to George.

34:24.680 --> 34:27.057
- As well she may be.
- Will you go to Trenwith?

34:27.240 --> 34:28.980
This instant.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.259
(Shooting practice continues)

34:37.600 --> 34:40.160
What is it?

34:40.320 --> 34:42.584
- Is it Drake?
- Agatha's grave.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.345
- Need we discuss that now?
- Things you need to attend to?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.306
What things?

34:50.480 --> 34:52.584
None that need concern you.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.387
That's convenient, Ross.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.620
No concern of mine
who you meet, who you talk to,

34:57.800 --> 34:59.461
who you kiss.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.020
It is not what you imagine.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.466
Ross, I am weary of it.
Secret kisses, secret smiles.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.987
How many other secrets
must there be between us?

35:16.240 --> 35:19.619
Keep them, Ross. Keep them all.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.779
And I will keep mine.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.379
Demelza.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.984
Urgent word from Truro, Captain.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.185
What is it? The French?

35:45.360 --> 35:48.227
The peace and safety of our country
is threatened.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.063
We're ordered to the northern road.
We must mobilise at once!

36:25.400 --> 36:26.981
Well...

36:28.200 --> 36:30.259
Can I make it any plainer?

36:30.440 --> 36:33.147
I abandoned my squadron
in the middle of a war...

36:34.120 --> 36:36.099
...to throw myself at your feet.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.060
Is there a more extravagant way
I could declare my love?

36:42.320 --> 36:44.697
A longer poem would have sufficed.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.546
Not for me.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.909
Shall we walk to Hendrawna Sands?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.064
May I take your hand?

37:18.240 --> 37:20.344
What if someone should see?

37:21.080 --> 37:23.457
I will tell them
that I need you to guide me.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.587
And very soon it will be true.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.825
I've been discharged from the Navy.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.546
For what?

37:34.720 --> 37:37.462
In six months' time,
I'll be completely blind.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.537
HUGH: I do not presume
to compare myself to Ross.

38:24.200 --> 38:28.148
He ’5 a great man.
My saviour and friend

38:36.640 --> 38:38.619
But you are...

38:38.800 --> 38:40.665
His wife.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.059
- And mother of his children.
- And I've no wish to threaten that.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.578
I would not allow it.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.706
Your head might not.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.659
But would your heart?

38:57.560 --> 38:59.778
HUGH:
It is to the heart
to which I now appeal

38:59.960 --> 39:02.064
and that part which, dare I say it

39:02.240 --> 39:04.299
has been neglected.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.699
Can you allow me this?

39:10.160 --> 39:12.344
Shall we grant ourselves to each other...

39:13.800 --> 39:16.303
...so that I may go into the darkness...

39:16.480 --> 39:20.223
knowing that I...
I once tasted heaven?

40:21.360 --> 40:23.339
(Cart rattling)

40:25.760 --> 40:28.467
(Shouting and rowdy chatter)

41:02.040 --> 41:05.100
THOLLY: We're here for the grain.
Stand aside.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.064
Take them home, Tholly.

41:10.440 --> 41:13.182
Your father would turn in his grave,

41:14.000 --> 41:18.778
his own son changing sides,
pandering to the pomp and privileged.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.500
When the French arrive,
you may wish to be elsewhere.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.909
THOLLY: There be no French.
Only threat to us here is thee.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.939
Will 'ee not take a stand with us,
brother?

41:38.840 --> 41:41.582
Will 'ee not show where thy loyalties lie?

41:41.760 --> 41:43.899
ROSS: You know where this leads, Tholly.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.584
Bloodshed. Riot.
We've both seen it.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.945
So go now and no harm will come to you!

41:51.120 --> 41:53.304
Folks is starving.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.664
You know who this grain store belong to?

41:56.920 --> 42:01.107
The man who battered thine own kin -
George Warleggan.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.026
Warleggan do think he's above the law!

42:06.200 --> 42:07.781
MOB: Aye!

42:08.600 --> 42:11.467
It's not thy duty to hold him to account?

42:11.640 --> 42:14.666
My duty is to king and country

42:14.840 --> 42:17.786
and I will do whatever it takes
to keep the peace.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.149
You have
until the count of ten to disperse.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.705
Or what, young captain?

42:31.120 --> 42:33.702
Or...what?

42:41.600 --> 42:43.659
Is this what they brought 'ee to?

42:44.560 --> 42:47.745
'Ee is so enthralled
with the establishment...

42:48.560 --> 42:52.189
...you'd subdue by force
your old comrades and friends?

42:52.360 --> 42:55.181
ROSS: You leave me no choice.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.960
One, two...

43:07.160 --> 43:09.617
...three, four...

43:11.560 --> 43:14.267
...five, six...

43:15.480 --> 43:17.903
...seven, eight...

43:18.840 --> 43:20.865
...nine...

43:28.800 --> 43:30.620
...ten.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.540
SIR FRANCIS: Terror, bloodshed
That is not democracy, that is vengeance.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.665
R055: I do not endorse bloodshed

43:37.840 --> 43:39.546
Demelza, I have never been that man.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.939
DEMELZ4: If you do not challenge
the corrupt and unjust;

43:43.120 --> 43:44.382
then commoners wﬂl rise.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.939
THOLL Y: You’d subdue by force
your old comrades and friends?

43:48.120 --> 43:50.941
DEMEIZ4:
Judas!
- (Screaming)

44:01.720 --> 44:04.029
You're right, my friend.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.457
Of course, I've changed sides.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.745
I'm not here to defend my country,

44:12.840 --> 44:16.025
but to protect the property
of my good friend, George,

44:16.200 --> 44:19.897
who would like nothing better than
for me to pick up arms against you.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.547
But the time has come
to take a stand against him.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.299
But not just here...

44:30.600 --> 44:32.739
...but in the corridors of Westminster.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.386
That much is clear now.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.581
So the next time I'm asked
to stand for public office...

44:43.960 --> 44:46.383
...can you imagine what my answer will be?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.979
THOLLY: Good lad.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.760
Elizabeth. I must...

45:34.400 --> 45:37.984
Are you saying that my doubts,
my suspicions,

45:38.160 --> 45:40.617
are completely unfounded?

45:45.920 --> 45:48.104
Name them and I will tell you.

45:52.840 --> 45:56.139
L...believe...

45:59.400 --> 46:01.960
I believe that you...

46:02.120 --> 46:04.224
still love Ross.

46:05.720 --> 46:09.349
No, George. That is not all you believe.

46:09.520 --> 46:12.660
- Is it not enough?
- More than enough.

46:12.840 --> 46:16.469
No doubt it's why you set your creatures
to follow me day and night,

46:17.080 --> 46:19.503
but that is not all, is it?

46:24.160 --> 46:26.264
Is it?

46:27.840 --> 46:30.741
Ah, I... Iwill...dismiss Tom Harry.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.138
I will repair the boy's smithy
at my own expense.

46:33.320 --> 46:37.381
Tell me why you treat your son
as if he were not your son.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.859
Is he my son?

46:45.920 --> 46:48.559
Who else's could he be?

46:56.080 --> 47:00.107
Now you see how jealousy is eating you up?

47:00.280 --> 47:01.747
I cannot abide it.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.619
I will not abide it.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.825
No, no, Elizabeth, please. I...

47:11.640 --> 47:16.100
I swear that I have never given myself
to another man,

47:16.280 --> 47:18.703
except my first husband, Francis, and you.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.869
But, of course,
even that will not satisfy you.

47:28.640 --> 47:31.905
So I will leave Trenwith today,
taking Geoffrey Charles and Valentine.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.822
No, no, Elizabeth, wait, I beg you.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.581
Perhaps I was...

47:36.760 --> 47:40.389
Perhaps... Perhaps I was too hasty.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.985
As you say, there have been suspicions -
unfounded, clearly unjust.

47:45.160 --> 47:48.140
I've been misguided

47:48.320 --> 47:53.144
and yet...you must see that this is
only a reflection of my regard,

47:53.320 --> 47:55.777
of my love, of my very great love.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.939
Is love cruel?

47:58.800 --> 48:01.018
Is love unkind?

48:01.200 --> 48:05.546
Is your bitter bile
coldness towards me and your son...

48:05.720 --> 48:07.779
It will cease, from this moment.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.939
So will my jealousy, so my suspicions.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.860
Swear it.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.184
I have sworn, so must you.

48:19.880 --> 48:25.420
You will never again speak
or even harbour such vile suspicions

48:25.600 --> 48:27.306
about your wife and child.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.539
I will not. I swear it.

48:30.400 --> 48:34.507
I will never...never again.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.179
Forgive me.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.619
Forgive me.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.579
I forgive you.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.779
Is Westminster ready for Ross Poldark?

48:58.960 --> 49:00.905
Ready or not, change is long overdue.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.184
When next it's offered,
I believe he'll accept.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.464
I have some changes of my own
I'd like to propose.

49:05.640 --> 49:09.747
Do they involve less patients,
less training with the volunteers?

49:09.920 --> 49:14.141
And, in their place, more kisses,
more bonbons and more lying abed.

49:14.320 --> 49:17.904
- Bonbons are bad for the health.
- But kisses are the cure for everything.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.261
(Growls softly)

49:23.440 --> 49:25.419
(Birdsong)

49:28.600 --> 49:30.579
(Door opens and closes)

49:32.480 --> 49:34.141
(Footsteps)

49:36.000 --> 49:38.662
- Where's Demelza?
- Out.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.146
Where?

49:43.200 --> 49:44.986
She didn't say.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.221
Alone?

49:51.520 --> 49:53.545
Had a visitor.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.587
Is she coming back?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.342
Expect so.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.667
She didn't say.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.859
(Birdsong)

50:23.080 --> 50:24.945
Thought I would die today.

50:29.240 --> 50:30.582
I, too.

50:31.640 --> 50:35.861
But when I did not, I began to think

50:36.040 --> 50:39.100
life has some purpose
that I knowed not till now.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.467
Why think you so?

50:44.080 --> 50:49.985
For this day, I found green shoots
coming up, out of season.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.781
And what shoots they be?

50:57.400 --> 50:59.379
Winter primroses.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.067
(He laughs)

52:05.320 --> 52:07.345
Well, Ross...

52:07.520 --> 52:11.502
My compliments to the volunteers.
I believe they were put to good use today.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.660
Oh, did you think you were being summoned
to fight the Frenchies?

52:17.840 --> 52:21.264
No, it seems Tom Harry
got the better of you.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.580
A little nudge and your muskets
protect my grain store.

52:24.760 --> 52:31.700
But you humble foot soldiers must go
where your betters decree, I believe.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.423
And what else do you believe, George?

52:42.120 --> 52:44.759
I believe I have _
every reason for optimism.

52:46.200 --> 52:50.387
I believe I have a devoted wife,
a thriving son, a fine estate

52:50.560 --> 52:53.620
and a parliamentary career
which has barely begun.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.939
What is it you believe, Ross?

53:00.120 --> 53:02.782
That belief is a beautiful thing.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.747
(Birdsong outside)

53:26.920 --> 53:28.820
(Knocking)

54:01.240 --> 54:03.219
Wherever you are...

54:05.200 --> 54:07.543
...know that I love you.

54:58.480 --> 55:00.459
(Snoring)

55:34.400 --> 55:36.379
(Door opens)

55:47.760 --> 55:49.500
(Door closes)

55:55.480 --> 55:57.459
I thought you might not return.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.979
I thought so, too.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.699
Yet here I am.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.379
Demelza.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.459
- May I ask?
- No, Ross.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.746
Ask me nothing.
