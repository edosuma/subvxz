00:25.025 --> 00:28.195
Spinifex, I love this stuff.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.280
Bush yams.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.198
Oh, parrot pea!

00:33.325 --> 00:35.661
Rattlepod, Brachyscome.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.955
Sorry. Am I rambling?

00:37.955 --> 00:39.665
I'm not good at interviews.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.751
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's just...

00:41.751 --> 00:44.253
this place, it never ceases to amaze.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.589
You know, we needed a new ranger
with an enviro degree,

00:46.589 --> 00:48.883
and lo and behold, here you are.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.344
Ah, desert raisin.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.974
Now you're showing off.

01:00.478 --> 01:04.565
So how are you with driving
offroad vehicles, quad bikes?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.984
Oh, I can drive anything.
Learnt when I was 10.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.321
Full disclosure,

01:10.321 --> 01:11.989
I wasn't really planning on
getting a job,

01:11.989 --> 01:12.990
just travelling.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.075
So I don't have any of my documents.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.538
And, um, this would be
my first job out of uni,

01:19.538 --> 01:21.874
so I don't really have any references.

01:21.874 --> 01:22.958
Oh.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.005
Well, obviously,
you know your stuff, and...

01:29.048 --> 01:30.800
...you know, Lulu
speaks highly of you, and...

01:32.676 --> 01:34.345
...and our head ranger...
You know Dylan?

01:35.387 --> 01:37.139
He said we'd be lucky
to have you, so...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.435
So...

01:41.435 --> 01:43.020
Let's get you a uniform.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.396
- Hey.
- Thank you.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.815
Nice to have you on board.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.826
Shouldn't we wait to say goodbye?

01:57.952 --> 02:01.205
I can't bear the idea of Alice
being out there another minute,

02:01.205 --> 02:04.500
still blaming herself for
Charlie's death when he's alive.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.170
There is so much she needs to be told,

02:08.170 --> 02:09.755
and I feel scared for her.

02:09.755 --> 02:13.175
I know this is hard, bub,
but come on.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.344
We both need to get away from here.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.137
Let's go meet Charlie,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.931
and then go find Alice.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.024
Candy.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.798
Given the extent to which
the cancer has spread,

02:52.798 --> 02:54.508
treatment options are somewhat limited,

02:54.508 --> 02:56.844
but we do have
an experimental drug trial.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.512
We could put you on the list.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.392
No. No treatment.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.478
Are you sure?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.776
Is there anyone we can call for you,

03:12.776 --> 03:16.155
to discuss palliative care,
pain management.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.198
- You're going to need support, June.
- Yeah.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.409
No.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.413
But I'll be alright.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.624
Thank you.

04:40.698 --> 04:44.243
Now the story we tell on our tour
is the one we teach our kids.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.620
And, like we tell our little ones,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.872
these stories are
our connection to country.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.876
We tell these stories in order to keep
our culture and our spirit

04:52.876 --> 04:55.254
and our knowledge strong, you know?

04:55.254 --> 04:58.298
Now that you're a Ranger,
you've got a responsibility

04:58.298 --> 05:00.467
to honour the story of this place.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.013
You also got to make sure
you protect this country.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.937
So part of your job is to stop people
from getting into the heart garden

05:11.937 --> 05:13.605
and taking them flowers.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.606
Hmm?

05:17.234 --> 05:21.405
They've been here for a long, long time.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.658
But with all the people coming in,
they're getting sick.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.120
- Root rot.
- Eh?

05:29.204 --> 05:30.873
They're vulnerable to root rot.

05:30.873 --> 05:34.460
If they're disturbed, they're more
likely to die from that than drought.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.379
Where you learn that from?
Your degree?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.672
No.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.175
From my grandmother.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.219
Mmm.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.340
...a dozen kangaroo paw to Wildling.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.342
Hang on a sec.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.052
Hey.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.262
You should have called.
I would have come and got you.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.641
I didn't think you'd be here.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.728
Well, the farm won't run itself.
Come on.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.445
- What are those men doing here?
- Repairs.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.947
- Oh, sorry.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.449
I need to take this.
You look like you need a rest.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.034
Marie, thanks for calling...

07:26.655 --> 07:30.159
I just was trying to impress her so much
I kept just talking and talking.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.661
Well, you must have
done something right.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.539
I mean, she's taking you out again
tomorrow for the full tour.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.124
She doesn't do that for everyone.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.130
Hey.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.174
- Well, thank you.
- Milady.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.888
Look at my little house.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.519
Never lived on my own before.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.022
You're not alone out here, you know?

08:01.398 --> 08:04.193
Aiden's just over there.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.028
I'm that little one just down there.

08:07.196 --> 08:11.950
And you see that house
all the way on the ridge over there?

08:11.950 --> 08:14.286
That's Dylan.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.913
So that's where he lives.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.582
Look at you.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.211
Well, what about Moss?

08:22.211 --> 08:23.879
I ended it.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.381
I'm sorry. He's a good guy.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.758
Yeah, I know.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.929
Just didn't have that... thing.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.224
Just wasn't meant to be.

08:42.064 --> 08:44.399
I have to go.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.694
Mwah.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.113
I'm glad you're here, Alice Hart.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.866
So how are you feeling?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.660
What did the doctor say?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.413
- Not much.
- Mm-hm?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.331
They reckon they got it all.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.333
No further treatment necessary.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.627
Well, I'll drink to that.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.171
- Good health.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.261
Is there any news on Alice?

09:54.261 --> 09:57.431
No, but Twig should be there by now.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.475
With Charlie.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.478
Who's Charlie?

10:13.405 --> 10:17.784
We don't discuss family matters
in front of the flowers.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.328
Why?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.288
Charlie's not a secret anymore.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.466
- I'm going to walk the perimeter.
- I've locked up already.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.009
Fences are all on.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.927
You need to sleep.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.220
Hi. Twig.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.471
- I'm Sally.
- Hi.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.847
Come in.

11:20.847 --> 11:21.973
- Hi, Twig. John.
- Hi.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.558
Nice to meet you. Come on through.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.898
This is Charlie.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.401
Hi.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.406
Oh, wow.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.562
Come on, girl.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.528
You want some water?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.948
Here.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.366
Some water.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.840
- Hi.
- Morning.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.676
Ah, who's this?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.511
Oh, this is Pip.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.222
- She likes you.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.190
Which way are you headed?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.567
That way.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.902
Me too.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.002
Pip! Come on!

13:14.002 --> 13:16.713
- Come on!

13:31.061 --> 13:33.563
So, this is me.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.400
And that path over there leads to you,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.110
and your fairy lights.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.739
See you at work?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.199
See you at work.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.331
I kept sending things
until she sent a letter

13:51.331 --> 13:53.917
saying she didn't want
any further contact.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.462
Charlie...

13:59.631 --> 14:02.300
Alice didn't write any of these.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.636
They were all written by June.

14:04.636 --> 14:09.349
Alice was told you died
in the fire that killed your parents.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.268
We were all told that.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.061
How could she do that?

14:14.229 --> 14:15.730
To Alice!

14:15.730 --> 14:17.983
To Charlie.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.151
I think she'd say...

14:20.151 --> 14:22.195
she was trying to protect Alice.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.823
From her own brother?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.033
It's complicated.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.160
So she doesn't know about me at all?

14:30.579 --> 14:31.830
No, bub.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.375
Alice has no idea.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.509
Even with the signs,
they still don't get it.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.219
People always
want to own something,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.804
even when it doesn't belong to them.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.473
That's when the sorry letters start.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.392
Sorry letters?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.893
What are they sorry for?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.187
For taking things they shouldn't be
touching in the first place.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.398
Flowers, rocks, you name it.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.026
Then they want to blame us
when something bad happens.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.402
Too late.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.903
That's what happens
when you don't listen.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.490
You do wrong ways
and you don't respect country well.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.172
Sir, can you please
get back on the path?

15:22.172 --> 15:24.049
Sorry.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.634
Thank you.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.648
Can you save me a beer?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.862
Well, well, well. Look who
decided to make an appearance.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.906
- How is it?
- Beautiful.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.157
Yeah?

16:03.672 --> 16:05.298
You never come hang out with us.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.189
- You're having fun?
-  Yeah.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.565
Yeah?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.153
What happened there.

16:28.238 --> 16:32.325
Um, I was in a car accident
when I was nine.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.620
My grandma was driving
and she was drunk and died.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.540
Oh, shit. I... I'm sorry.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.625
That's OK. I barely remember it.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.003
Sorry.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.338
It's OK.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.768
Lulu. Lulu!

16:58.768 --> 17:00.395
You have to chill.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.647
- Relax.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.589
I have been looking
for you everywhere.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.132
Well, you found me.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.719
Is this Charlie?

17:32.719 --> 17:33.928
No.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.097
- I don't want you in here! Stop it!
- Here, let me help.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.433
- No, I don't want you to help!
- Oh, for fuck's sake, June!

17:40.602 --> 17:42.353
You're sick.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.274
I talked to your doctors.
I know that you're dying.

17:47.567 --> 17:52.113
All this secretive bullshit
has given you cancer.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.698
And you're still doing it,

17:53.698 --> 17:56.701
shoving it all back down in a box,
hiding it all away.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.585
This is not your business.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.504
Yes, it is.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.422
I'm not a child anymore.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.299
You need to stop treating me
like one.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.511
You can't even look at me.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.935
You haven't really looked at me
since I was a kid.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.690
I'm all you've got left, June.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.734
Everyone else is gone.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.069
And you still can't do it.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.279
You still can't look at me.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.782
Look at you?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.368
I don't look at you...

18:38.368 --> 18:41.371
because I don't know what this is.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.873
And all the slinking around
and listening at doors

18:43.873 --> 18:46.000
and sex with strangers!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.002
Do you think I don't know?

18:49.587 --> 18:51.714
What is all this?

18:51.714 --> 18:53.466
Who are you?

19:32.589 --> 19:34.340
You're so fast!

20:40.615 --> 20:43.242
What the fuck?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.827
Can you look at me now?

20:44.827 --> 20:45.828
Oy.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.675
Still not enough, am I?

21:00.134 --> 21:02.387
I never have been.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.514
Not since what happened.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.560
Let's not talk about this.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.854
You replaced me with Agnes,

21:11.854 --> 21:13.481
the daughter you always wanted.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.442
Perfect Agnes.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.111
She wasn't damaged.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.030
So much easier to love.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.579
What happened was messed up,

21:28.579 --> 21:30.248
and it hurt.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.087
But I loved him...

21:36.087 --> 21:37.630
more than anything.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.508
It broke my heart.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.469
And you found out
and you sent me away.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.932
And when I came back,
it was like nothing happened.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.102
It happened.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.271
And what fucked us was all the lies,

21:53.271 --> 21:54.772
all the not talking about it,

21:54.772 --> 21:57.025
all the not talking about anything.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.988
I can deal with what happened.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.992
But I can't deal with you
judging me and shaming me.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.216
Clem!

23:03.216 --> 23:05.176
Get off her!

23:05.176 --> 23:06.636
Get off!

23:10.056 --> 23:12.725
Mum! It's not what you think!

23:12.725 --> 23:14.060
I'm sorry!

23:15.061 --> 23:16.395
I would never hurt her.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.772
I would never do that.

23:17.772 --> 23:20.108
I love her. She loves me.
We're in love.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.944
She's 13. She's a child.

23:22.944 --> 23:26.155
You're her brother.
You're meant to look after her.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.573
I did look after her.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.909
I would never hurt her, Mum.
I love her!

23:29.909 --> 23:32.078
You raped her.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.708
You're wrong! You are so wrong.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.085
I would never do that!

23:39.085 --> 23:40.920
I... I care about her!

23:40.920 --> 23:44.006
I want you out of this house,
and you stay away from Candy.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.509
Don't you look at her,
don't you talk to her.

23:46.509 --> 23:47.969
Don't you dare touch her!

23:49.178 --> 23:52.640
You are not a worthy man.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.809
You're wrong,
I would never do that!

23:54.809 --> 23:56.352
Get out!

23:56.352 --> 23:57.353
- Out!
- Please...

23:57.353 --> 23:58.938
Out! Go!

23:58.938 --> 24:00.106
Go!

24:09.615 --> 24:11.117
Oh, my God! What's this?

24:11.117 --> 24:12.577
You said it was a housewarming.

24:12.577 --> 24:15.288
- You shouldn't have.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.372
Thank you.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.667
Well, don't thank me to open it,
because you might hate it.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.587
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

24:22.587 --> 24:25.798
- I'll put these in the fridge.
- Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.133
Open it!

24:28.301 --> 24:30.636
I saw it and I thought of you,
so I hope you like it.

24:32.013 --> 24:35.349
- Oh, my...

24:38.144 --> 24:40.104
- I love it.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.608
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.152
- Who else are we expecting?

24:46.152 --> 24:48.029
Uh... Can you hold out for one second?

24:55.870 --> 24:56.996
Hey.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.289
Come in.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.792
Thank you.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.214
Hey.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.382
Dylan. It's good to see you, mate.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.092
Hey, man.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.719
Uh, I'll grab some glasses.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.845
- Wine?
- Yes, please.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.138
OK, great.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.602
I've been away for so long that
I don't know what home is.

25:19.602 --> 25:20.978
Oh, my God.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.521
Please don't call yourself
a man of the world.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.023
I fucking hate that shit.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.733
Man of the world?

25:25.733 --> 25:26.901
That's a Fleetwood Mac song.

25:26.901 --> 25:27.944
What?

25:27.944 --> 25:30.404
I didn't take you for
a Fleetwood Mac kind of guy.

25:30.404 --> 25:31.447
Yeah.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.699
Oh, that's so cute.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.078
My dad used to like it.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.455
He'd play it on his guitar to my mum.

25:43.668 --> 25:47.880
So... how long have you been away?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.757
I don't know.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.802
I think seven and a half years.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.515
I was travelling across Europe
for a couple of years,

25:57.515 --> 25:59.016
then Asia.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.269
And then I came to Australia.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.605
What about you?
Where do you want to go?

26:06.941 --> 26:09.777
I haven't really travelled much yet,

26:09.777 --> 26:12.697
so everywhere feels kind of special.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.659
You know, if you really want to
see something special,

26:16.659 --> 26:19.787
there's this gorge about a day's drive.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.082
At sunset,
when the light hits the water...

26:24.250 --> 26:26.585
...it's like something
from another world.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.045
I'd like to see that.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.967
When's your next day off?

27:08.461 --> 27:11.172
You've done a great job with Charlie.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.925
Oh. Thank you.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.720
He's probably better off
being raised here, with you.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.889
Away from Thornfield.

27:23.184 --> 27:26.020
June paid for everything, you know?

27:26.020 --> 27:28.356
All the best specialists,
anything he needed,

27:28.356 --> 27:30.107
no questions asked.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.660
So he's always known from the start
that he was adopted,

27:41.660 --> 27:44.163
what happened to his parents,
and Alice?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.331
Yeah.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.751
When he was 14,
we let him read the coroner's report.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.922
So that he could understand the truth...

27:54.632 --> 27:57.009
...what really happened.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.388
- What do you mean?
- The report findings...

28:01.722 --> 28:03.724
...John sent to June.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.435
You didn't read them.

28:06.435 --> 28:07.812
No.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.398
And neither did June.

28:10.398 --> 28:13.192
Oh, my God.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.403
So you have no idea?

28:48.436 --> 28:49.895
Agnes.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.021
Hi, June.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.731
Welcome to Thornfield.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.609
I'm sorry for your loss.

28:57.361 --> 28:58.988
Your mother was a good friend.

29:04.285 --> 29:07.037
It's beautiful. Did you make it?

29:07.037 --> 29:10.332
No. Feels bad to throw it out.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.042
Let's get you inside.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.922
Clem, give us a hand, please.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.017
Clem did that.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.228
- Really?
- Mmm.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.606
Wow.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.566
You have such a gift.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.237
Here. It's yours.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.910
Thank you.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.418
I can show you around if you like.

29:54.418 --> 29:58.339
After you've unpacked, obviously.

29:58.339 --> 30:01.217
OK. I'd like that.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.787
Agnes never replaced you.

31:13.831 --> 31:17.001
I did it to keep him away from you.

31:17.001 --> 31:19.712
You were just a little girl.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.255
A child.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.677
Agnes...

31:26.677 --> 31:29.888
was older, needing love.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.479
And...

31:38.647 --> 31:40.524
...I encouraged it...

31:41.692 --> 31:47.072
...not because she was perfect
or untarnished,

31:47.072 --> 31:49.575
but just to keep him away from you.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.495
It was always about protecting you.

31:58.626 --> 32:01.462
I understand if you want to go.

32:01.462 --> 32:04.548
But please know...

32:04.548 --> 32:07.968
I see you, my Candy Blue.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.779
- Are you sure that you're sure?
- I'm sure that I'm sure.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.866
OK, I'm not sure.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.328
Ready?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.417
After you.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.555
Hi, Ruby!

32:56.892 --> 32:59.144
Look at you two. Beer?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.896
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.232
- Where have you guys been?
- Just... places. You know?

33:03.232 --> 33:04.566
- Cheers.
- Salut.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.485
- Cheers.
- Catch you later.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.696
Do you want me to open that for you?

33:31.969 --> 33:33.470
Hey, stranger.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.267
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.144
Do you want a drink?
There's, um, tequila.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.520
No, I'm good.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.110
I feel like you're avoiding us.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.487
Dylan and I.

33:50.487 --> 33:53.907
No, I'm happy for you. I really am.
I've just...

33:53.907 --> 33:56.702
never seen him out in public
with a girl before, so...

34:00.122 --> 34:03.417
Just... be careful,

34:03.417 --> 34:06.044
because, um, he can be a lot.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.384
Oh.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.678
Hey, please don't say anything to Dylan.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.598
It's all good. I'm happy for you.

34:17.598 --> 34:18.891
Seriously.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.851
Yeah, it's ancient history.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.271
It's fine.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.941
Hey, you.

34:27.941 --> 34:29.735
You take good care
of this one, OK?

34:31.195 --> 34:32.529
Of course.

34:47.961 --> 34:50.464
We think she's here, Agnes Bluff.

34:50.464 --> 34:52.466
That's where she last used
her credit card.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.056
Well...

34:59.056 --> 35:00.641
I need to get packing.

35:16.490 --> 35:18.116
Can I come?

35:18.116 --> 35:20.744
I just really want to
meet her.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.333
Let me find Alice,

35:26.333 --> 35:28.836
and I will tell you all about you.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.964
I promise.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.465
You'll get to meet her.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.353
These are twiggy daisies.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.693
They mean
'your presence eases my pain'.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.177
Come on. Where are you taking me?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.054
- You wait and see.
- Can I have a hint?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.723
No. OK. It's red.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.183
- OK.
- There's rocks in it.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.394
There might be water.
We don't know.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.980
- Ooh, water?
- Mm-hm.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.065
But it's a surprise.
I think you'll love it.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.160
Not bad, huh?

37:15.859 --> 37:18.487
- Oh!

37:31.416 --> 37:32.584
Wait.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.257
Come.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.055
OK.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.266
Wait till you see this. Lie down.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.371
Wow.

38:13.834 --> 38:14.960
See?

38:15.961 --> 38:18.463
Like something
from another world, right?

38:27.389 --> 38:29.266
Did you bring Lulu here?

38:35.564 --> 38:37.733
What the fuck would you say
something like that?

38:37.733 --> 38:39.151
I... I just...

38:39.151 --> 38:40.777
Oh, fuck.

38:42.112 --> 38:44.114
Dylan!

38:44.114 --> 38:45.449
Dylan, stop!

38:47.034 --> 38:49.494
Please!
I didn't mean anything by it, I...

38:50.996 --> 38:52.247
Come back!

38:53.290 --> 38:54.624
Dylan!

39:05.260 --> 39:06.553
Dylan?

39:33.497 --> 39:34.706
Alice.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.966
I... I'm so sorry.

39:46.093 --> 39:47.469
I don't know why I said that, OK?

39:47.469 --> 39:49.429
I'm s... I'm such an idiot.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.015
I'm sorry.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.814
Is there any food left?

40:00.816 --> 40:01.983
Yeah.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.452
Thanks.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.777
Oh, so, that.
So I need another one of those.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.070
Yeah.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.948
Good luck with that.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.169
Twig's found her.

41:02.169 --> 41:04.296
Alice, she's in Agnes Bluff.

41:05.380 --> 41:08.133
Agnes.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.342
Of course.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.604
It'll be OK.

41:22.230 --> 41:25.150
Not till you dye your bloody hair back.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.527
I miss my Candy Blue.

42:11.905 --> 42:14.282
I did bring Lulu here.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.369
But, um...

42:19.120 --> 42:20.705
...we were never a thing.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.836
Not like this.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.301
I'm sorry I ruined it.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.429
What? No.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.139
- You haven't...
- I just...

42:38.139 --> 42:42.852
I've never felt like this
about someone before.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.067
And it's freaking me out.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.488
I've never felt this way
about anyone either.

43:08.044 --> 43:09.838
You've seen my shitty side,

43:09.838 --> 43:11.548
what's underneath.

43:13.967 --> 43:15.593
And you're just... Golden.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.762
- No.
-  Yeah.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.348
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah. You're beautiful.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.559
Stop. Stop. You don't know.

43:26.146 --> 43:27.689
Tell me.

43:28.732 --> 43:31.568
If I tell you,
I won't be your golden girl anymore.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.406
Then tell me.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.986
When I was little...

44:18.531 --> 44:22.243
...I used to dream about
setting my dad on fire.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.126
And...

44:31.336 --> 44:32.962
And one day, I did.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.348
Um...

44:43.348 --> 44:45.225
He... He used to hurt us.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.601
Me and my mum.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.523
And she was going to have a baby,
and I just...

45:00.907 --> 45:03.034
I just wanted it to stop.

45:07.038 --> 45:08.581
And, uh...

45:11.668 --> 45:14.212
And I stole the kerosene.

45:16.506 --> 45:18.007
And, um...

45:19.300 --> 45:22.595
...everything went up in flames,

45:22.595 --> 45:24.264
and they died.

45:27.684 --> 45:29.811
I... I killed them all.

45:55.128 --> 45:56.796
It's OK.

45:58.131 --> 45:59.841
You were just a kid.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.094
It's not your fault.

46:05.805 --> 46:10.435
And I'm so sorry he hurt you like that.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.438
But I'm here now.

46:16.024 --> 46:17.358
I'm here.

46:29.245 --> 46:32.457
There is no shitty past.

46:33.541 --> 46:34.918
It's just us now.

46:36.085 --> 46:37.879
Because we found each other.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.718
You and me...

46:45.470 --> 46:47.013
...we're the same.

46:51.351 --> 46:52.977
You and me.
