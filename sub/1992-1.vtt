00:40.918 --> 00:43.668
Shanghai, 1930

00:44.168 --> 00:47.418
A city of dreams for all Chinese people

00:47.959 --> 00:51.084
If you are willing to work hard,
you can raise your family

00:51.418 --> 00:54.959
But if you are willing to sacrifice,
a piece of paradise awaits you

00:55.209 --> 00:57.834
There is only one principle here

00:58.209 --> 01:01.418
Only the strong survives

01:02.251 --> 01:04.709
They give up their blood,
sweat and tears here

01:05.584 --> 01:07.834
For a future of wealth and prosperity

01:08.834 --> 01:11.709
Yet many people try to
take the easy way out

01:12.501 --> 01:15.126
And become gangsters

01:15.876 --> 01:18.918
The temptation of money and power

01:19.584 --> 01:22.418
Left behind countless dead bodies
by Huangpu Jiang.

01:22.876 --> 01:25.376
Yet

01:25.626 --> 01:29.626
Young lads are still rushing in
by the thousands

01:29.876 --> 01:32.751
To chase their dreams

02:17.418 --> 02:18.709
Finish him.

02:32.209 --> 02:33.209
Brother Ma.

03:17.584 --> 03:21.376
My son, this village is no longer
a place for you.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.584
You and Fritter bring Flora to Shanghai
to find her father.

03:26.918 --> 03:29.418
Your right fist is way too strong.

03:31.334 --> 03:33.254
It will cause immense damage
to those around you.

03:34.251 --> 03:35.971
From now on, before you hit with your fist,

03:36.501 --> 03:38.421
look at this bracelet and remember
what Mom said.

03:45.084 --> 03:46.376
We arrived in Shanghai.

04:36.418 --> 04:38.750
Support us with money if you have. If
not, please still support our performers.

04:38.751 --> 04:46.751
Thank you.

04:56.251 --> 04:57.251
Punks.

05:27.626 --> 05:28.918
We've arrived!

05:58.793 --> 06:01.209
Dad, Dad...

06:04.543 --> 06:08.001
So this is what Brother Niu calls
a grand mansion in Shanghai Bund?

06:09.209 --> 06:10.501
What a dump!

06:12.668 --> 06:14.375
Much better than our hometown though.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.001
Little punk, who are you looking for?

06:16.560 --> 06:17.560
Brother Niu.

06:17.584 --> 06:18.668
What Brother Niu?

06:19.418 --> 06:21.668
Niu Sanguang, Brother Niu.

06:21.793 --> 06:25.376
Niu Sanguang, I should have known you
punks were from the same slum.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.793
Dinner's ready.

06:41.918 --> 06:48.334
Excuse me... Oh Uncle, you're so early?
Hi, Master Tie.

06:51.918 --> 06:53.459
Buddies from your hometown?

06:54.334 --> 06:57.000
Yes, buddies from my hometown.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.750
They look up to me.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.708
As their brother,

07:00.709 --> 07:02.251
I have to feed them, right?

07:02.959 --> 07:04.793
Stop running your business

07:05.334 --> 07:07.042
and get a job as a labourer

07:07.043 --> 07:09.168
with your buddies.

07:09.293 --> 07:09.751
Oh.

07:10.209 --> 07:11.376
You can't owe your rent for too long.

07:11.501 --> 07:11.918
Fine.

07:12.043 --> 07:13.918
I will give you two more days, ok?

07:14.126 --> 07:15.126
Fine, fine, fine...

07:24.834 --> 07:27.043
Brothers, let's dig in.

07:27.126 --> 07:28.126
Let's dig in.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.000
Gals with this quality

07:40.001 --> 07:42.876
are everywhere in Shanghai Bund.

07:44.251 --> 07:48.292
Well, I think Master Tie is a good man.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.834
Good man?

07:51.168 --> 07:54.126
Good men in Shanghai Bund

07:54.251 --> 07:59.334
always finish last.

08:02.209 --> 08:04.793
As your big brother,

08:04.876 --> 08:12.709
I should welcome you to this place

08:14.209 --> 08:18.959
and show you the real Shanghai night life.

08:24.084 --> 08:25.543
Are you that hungry?

08:36.626 --> 08:37.626
Brother Niu,

08:38.833 --> 08:40.833
everyone says Shanghai is so prosperous.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.691
But how come there is no one around?

08:43.458 --> 08:46.001
This is the current situation of Shanghai.

08:46.418 --> 08:47.750
The weak are the prey for the strong,

08:47.751 --> 08:49.251
only the fittest will survive here;

08:49.584 --> 08:51.708
That was the old Shanghai,

08:51.709 --> 08:53.043
prosperous, vibrant,

08:53.334 --> 08:56.625
with everything you desire.

08:56.626 --> 08:58.333
It's just like a piece of fatty meat.

08:58.334 --> 08:59.418
Everyone wants a bite,

09:00.293 --> 09:04.751
even the Japanese
is waiting for their opportunity.

09:06.751 --> 09:07.834
Don't worry.

09:08.293 --> 09:11.084
The Japanese cannot claim this place yet.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.334
Shanghai Bund is dominated

09:12.543 --> 09:15.084
by the four bosses in Axe Fraternity.

09:15.501 --> 09:16.622
Each with his own territory.

09:18.251 --> 09:22.668
Laughing Buddha, Scruffy Chou, Baldy Bai

09:24.459 --> 09:26.459
and Chen Mou oversee the entire Shanghai.

09:26.709 --> 09:30.751
But, something happened this year.

09:34.501 --> 09:37.501
Someone called Long Qi
has risen through the ranks.

09:37.959 --> 09:38.959
He has completely changed

09:39.543 --> 09:41.709
the power distribution of Shanghai Bund.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.333
Nowadays people walking on the street

09:51.334 --> 09:53.376
are either triad members
or Japanese officials.

09:55.668 --> 09:57.293
When Long Qi first arrived in Shanghai,

09:57.751 --> 10:00.834
he was even less fortunate
than we are right now.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.001
But now, he has everything.

10:03.209 --> 10:04.001
How did he do it?

10:04.126 --> 10:05.626
With his fists,

10:05.709 --> 10:07.751
and conquered

10:07.834 --> 10:09.274
the territories one street at a time

10:39.251 --> 10:41.418
If you can survive

10:42.251 --> 10:43.876
before the cigarette burns out,

10:44.918 --> 10:47.459
I will let you carry on being the boss
of Peony Night Club.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.751
You are here to negotiate
with Long Qi today.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.443
I am here to enjoy the performance.

10:55.293 --> 10:58.459
I can't help if you guys want to fight.

11:02.334 --> 11:05.626
Soldiers die because they are cowards.

11:06.209 --> 11:10.751
I was born in Shanghai.
This is my only way...

12:14.293 --> 12:19.751
That's why,
everyone should enjoy the here and now,

12:21.001 --> 12:22.709
especially in Shanghai.

12:31.918 --> 12:36.168
From now on, this place
belongs to me, Long Qi.

12:37.751 --> 12:41.918
Peony Night Club was gone.
We will name this, the Paradise Club.

12:45.251 --> 12:46.543
Any objection?

12:49.293 --> 12:50.543
Any objection?

13:00.501 --> 13:01.668
You won't object, right?

13:06.584 --> 13:09.001
Scruffy Chou, why are you still here?

13:09.668 --> 13:13.043
Well, please bring my message back,

13:13.709 --> 13:14.792
I now own half of Shanghai Bund;

13:14.793 --> 13:17.793
you three men will own the other half.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.543
With this street as our boundary,

13:19.793 --> 13:21.084
the side near the Bund is mine.

13:21.293 --> 13:22.543
You three can decide the rest.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.293
Agreed?

13:27.584 --> 13:32.959
That's it.
I was told you are a great songstress.

13:34.084 --> 13:35.084
Sing me a song.

13:49.668 --> 13:57.668
Can you think of me?

14:05.251 --> 14:10.584
Can I still stay with you

14:10.751 --> 14:15.459
since you said nothing kept you

14:15.918 --> 14:20.626
The road back seemed more gloomy

14:21.168 --> 14:25.751
I am worried to let you go by yourself

14:26.001 --> 14:30.959
I think it was because I
was not gentle enough

14:31.459 --> 14:36.376
I could not share your sorrow

14:36.584 --> 14:41.084
If it is hard to say it out

14:41.709 --> 14:47.251
Then just leave the regret in my heart...

14:47.751 --> 14:48.751
Brother Niu.

14:50.459 --> 14:53.251
The powerful Chen Mou
that you just mentioned,

14:54.543 --> 14:56.668
is he the old man lying on the floor?

14:57.126 --> 14:59.376
That's what I want to tell you guys.

15:00.168 --> 15:02.126
This is Shanghai Bund.

15:02.459 --> 15:05.793
It's unpredictable. Things
change every minute.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.208
Despite the power of the four gang leaders,

15:09.209 --> 15:12.668
they can't overthrow Long Qi, he came out
of nowhere and now has a hold of Shanghai

15:20.626 --> 15:21.668
He is Long Qi?

15:22.543 --> 15:24.668
Right, he is Long Qi.

15:24.959 --> 15:28.668
Look at him. His figure is flawless.

15:29.126 --> 15:31.626
His is wealthy beyond our means.

15:32.084 --> 15:33.084
With his fighting skills,

15:33.085 --> 15:37.376
no one can stand to take ten hits from him.

15:37.626 --> 15:39.417
Shanghai Bund needs him.

15:39.418 --> 15:41.626
He belongs to Shanghai Bund.

15:43.126 --> 15:44.959
Mr. Long, congratulations.

16:37.751 --> 16:40.376
Even with Chen Mou's two decades
of Kung Fu practice,

16:40.709 --> 16:44.543
Long Qi took him outwith
just a few strikes.

16:45.918 --> 16:50.876
That old bag died instantly.
It was too easy on him.

16:58.293 --> 16:59.376
From now on,

16:59.501 --> 17:01.626
North Gate, and Pudong belong to us.

17:02.293 --> 17:04.126
He will own the rest.

17:04.751 --> 17:08.376
Setting Chen's Peony Night Club as boundary,
trespassing will result in further conflict.

17:09.459 --> 17:12.458
We still dominate half of Shanghai

17:12.459 --> 17:15.459
while Long Qi possesses the other half.

17:16.251 --> 17:17.251
Why still count?

17:18.584 --> 17:20.584
It's half of the revenue we earn.

17:21.584 --> 17:23.704
Just have someone send Long Qi
the money on the floor.

17:36.834 --> 17:40.375
We three have tried to get rid of
Chen Mou for three years,

17:40.376 --> 17:41.876
resulting in over a hundred deaths.

17:42.334 --> 17:44.293
He could still alive until today.

17:44.751 --> 17:47.876
But Long Qi finished him once
he stepped foot in Shanghai.

17:48.251 --> 17:51.083
We should be more than happy
about his existence.

17:51.084 --> 17:53.084
You think you have exploited Long Qi.

17:53.501 --> 17:54.543
But don't forget,

17:54.709 --> 17:56.209
if you feed the beast,

17:56.376 --> 17:57.896
the beast will one day bite your hand.

17:58.876 --> 18:02.668
Throughout these years,
so many young lads have come here

18:03.876 --> 18:06.501
and finally ended up
at the bottom of the river, right?

18:07.168 --> 18:09.918
Bai, do you think

18:10.209 --> 18:12.501
we will be just like Chen Mou one day?

18:23.418 --> 18:25.876
Remember to cut it this way next time,

18:26.084 --> 18:29.501
otherwise your hand is useless.

18:36.751 --> 18:40.334
Wait till that kid conquers
and expands his territories.

18:41.084 --> 18:44.543
Then we will harvest
what his hard work has sown.

18:45.543 --> 18:47.251
How does that sound?

18:58.834 --> 18:59.834
Excited?

19:09.084 --> 19:14.334
Come on... line up.

19:21.418 --> 19:22.709
Wait for me here.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.543
Brother Liu.

19:31.418 --> 19:33.459
I am Guang.

19:46.418 --> 19:50.333
Wow, you can drink with the best of them.

19:50.334 --> 19:51.584
It tastes like water!

19:52.043 --> 19:57.668
Brother Liu, trust me,

19:57.751 --> 19:59.084
the guy that I introduced to you

19:59.501 --> 20:01.126
is no ordinary man.

20:01.459 --> 20:03.125
He is really strong.

20:03.126 --> 20:07.543
He alone can do the work of several men,

20:10.168 --> 20:12.001
Who could be this strong?

20:12.376 --> 20:18.168
He is from my hometown,
his name is Ma Yongzhen.

20:25.751 --> 20:31.543
One, Two, Three! Wow, unbelievable!

20:32.418 --> 20:33.959
Once more, good, let's go.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.293
One, Two, Three!

20:44.793 --> 20:45.793
Once more,

20:46.126 --> 20:48.501
One, Two, Three!

20:57.959 --> 20:59.126
Brother Ma, you are amazing.

21:02.584 --> 21:04.168
One, Two, Three!

21:06.126 --> 21:08.584
Keep it UP!

21:11.834 --> 21:15.876
Great, You are amazing.

21:37.043 --> 21:38.959
Damn, you scum.

21:42.501 --> 21:46.626
Kid, if you can hold on for one minute.

21:47.293 --> 21:48.293
I'll hire you.

21:49.584 --> 21:50.584
Let's go.

21:51.084 --> 21:53.251
Sir, I have two more friends.

21:53.459 --> 21:54.958
If I can hold for three minutes,

21:54.959 --> 21:56.000
can you hire us all?

21:56.001 --> 21:57.001
Sure.

21:59.168 --> 22:07.168
Come on...

22:55.126 --> 22:58.793
Sir, this pocket watch is very expensive.
Don't break it.

23:08.376 --> 23:09.668
Interesting!

23:10.126 --> 23:14.209
Alright, 80 cents a day,

23:14.668 --> 23:16.084
with meals, no housing.

23:16.751 --> 23:17.751
Thank you, sir.

23:18.626 --> 23:20.918
Generous. Isn't Brother
Hei Mao just generous?

23:32.209 --> 23:33.290
Write it here! Write nicer.

23:33.709 --> 23:35.417
Does it look better now?

23:35.418 --> 23:37.293
Little Flora, Little Flora.

23:37.626 --> 23:38.626
What, Dad?

23:41.209 --> 23:42.418
See what dad bought you.

23:47.709 --> 23:48.709
Fireworks!

23:49.876 --> 23:51.543
Let's play after dinner.

23:52.959 --> 23:54.126
Sister Ju, look,

23:54.293 --> 23:56.001
Dad just bought me fireworks.

23:56.918 --> 24:00.918
Sister Ju, Sister Ju...

24:11.168 --> 24:14.543
Brother Ma, come.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.668
Have a seat,

24:31.185 --> 24:32.185
my brother.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.209
What is this?

24:35.459 --> 24:37.126
Brother Ma, you know what?

24:37.834 --> 24:39.834
The Japanese tea in the godown today

24:40.168 --> 24:41.168
is actually opium.

24:41.501 --> 24:44.918
Brother Ma, this is worth
about six to seven hundred silver dollars.

24:46.043 --> 24:47.043
Put that back.

24:47.418 --> 24:50.876
Brother Ma, you're still young.

24:52.209 --> 24:55.876
But look at me, I am useless.

24:56.251 --> 24:58.750
I can work all my life in Shanghai
and gain nothing

24:58.751 --> 25:01.792
Dad, Dad, let's go,
let's light up the fireworks.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.209
I'll be with you in a second.
Go down first.

25:06.793 --> 25:08.668
Brother Ma, I know you are a nice guy.

25:24.918 --> 25:27.668
Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!

25:30.918 --> 25:35.001
Little Flora, we won't separate ever after.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.959
Our lives will get better.

25:38.334 --> 25:40.751
Come, let's have dinner.

25:49.168 --> 25:50.168
Let's eat.

25:52.293 --> 25:56.543
Little Flora, you are on
your own to Shanghai.

25:57.001 --> 26:00.084
You are so young. You're just super.

26:09.793 --> 26:11.751
Before Mom left,

26:13.043 --> 26:15.668
she said she could no
long take care of you.

26:17.251 --> 26:21.501
It must be hard to make a living
away from home.

26:23.126 --> 26:26.334
I will take care of you

26:26.793 --> 26:30.001
from now on.

26:38.209 --> 26:39.918
Dad, it's ok.

26:40.418 --> 26:43.043
Our lives will get better.

26:47.834 --> 26:52.001
Little Flora,
Dad brings you to study in Hong Kong?

26:52.709 --> 26:55.459
Great, let's bring Mom too.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.001
Of course.

27:00.293 --> 27:02.126
Dad, I saved this big piece for you

27:02.168 --> 27:04.958
You can have it. I have some here.
Let's eat.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.626
It's alright. You can eat it later.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.084
OK, let's eat.

27:09.959 --> 27:12.834
Ma Yongzhen, listen. I apologize.

27:12.977 --> 27:13.977
You...

27:14.001 --> 27:16.376
Well, I was wrong.

27:16.584 --> 27:18.418
I thought you were a
punk like Niu Sanguang.

27:18.834 --> 27:20.034
Yet you are just the opposite.

27:20.168 --> 27:22.126
You even found jobs for your friends.

27:22.251 --> 27:24.334
I had you all wrong, sorry.

27:24.668 --> 27:25.251
No need to apologize.

27:25.293 --> 27:26.293
I must.

27:27.251 --> 27:29.418
Don't be such a lame. Are you a man?

27:37.352 --> 27:38.352
Fine. You can apologize.

27:38.376 --> 27:39.709
Didn't I just apologize?

27:40.918 --> 27:41.918
I accept it then.

27:43.709 --> 27:45.543
I will treat you better from now on.

27:46.144 --> 27:47.144
How much better?

27:47.168 --> 27:48.208
I won't scold you anymore.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.060
That's better.

27:50.084 --> 27:54.168
What are you thinking?
It's only an apology.

28:18.918 --> 28:20.083
You bunch of godown workers,

28:20.084 --> 28:21.084
show yourself.

28:22.168 --> 28:25.001
Some stock went missing today.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.750
Can't believe you bastards would dare

28:27.751 --> 28:30.293
to steal from the Axe Fraternity.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.834
My dad is a good man. He doesn't steal.

28:35.709 --> 28:37.043
I count to three.

28:37.751 --> 28:39.376
Show yourself.

28:40.043 --> 28:43.709
Otherwise, I will wipe
out your entire complex.

28:47.334 --> 28:52.043
One, Two...

28:54.418 --> 28:55.876
Damn it!

29:22.376 --> 29:24.750
Bullying women and kids?

29:24.751 --> 29:26.209
Are you a man?

29:27.293 --> 29:30.751
I don't care. I must get
my stock back tonight.

29:31.376 --> 29:33.043
We are all peasants.

29:34.084 --> 29:36.168
We don't understand your violent world.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.626
When we say we didn't steal it, we mean it.

29:39.251 --> 29:40.251
Now, leave.

29:52.209 --> 29:54.126
I will be back. I will be back.

29:57.376 --> 29:58.501
Dad!

29:58.918 --> 30:01.043
<i>Drunken Shun.</i>

30:09.501 --> 30:11.342
Does this little packet
worth a person's life?

30:18.834 --> 30:19.959
Way more than one life.

30:20.918 --> 30:23.168
More than the lives of the entire village.

32:00.834 --> 32:08.209
Inspector Wong, how will
you handle the opium?

32:09.959 --> 32:12.293
Yes, how will you handle them?
Inspector Wong...

32:13.876 --> 32:15.126
Inspector, look at this.

32:20.209 --> 32:24.001
Mr. Tong, please relate the message
to Mr. Shinji Tsutsumi:

32:25.001 --> 32:28.459
our police office
will not return the stock to him.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.668
Sorry, Shinji-san,

32:36.168 --> 32:41.209
Inspector said the stock
cannot be reclaimed.

32:42.793 --> 32:44.668
What if we have to take it back?

32:59.584 --> 33:01.043
Let's go.

33:03.584 --> 33:06.584
You interfered with the trafficking between
the Japanese and Axe Fraternity.

33:07.834 --> 33:09.626
They will come back for you.

33:09.959 --> 33:11.084
What's all these?

33:12.043 --> 33:15.626
Smuggling opium, disregarding human lives.

33:17.251 --> 33:20.251
I am not scared of them

33:22.668 --> 33:25.333
Shanghai is not a place for

33:25.334 --> 33:26.876
you simple-minded labourers.

33:27.418 --> 33:31.501
It is a prosperous yet complicated place,
with people coming from all walks of life.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.709
Young people can easily go astray
in a place like this...

33:34.793 --> 33:38.043
I promised my mom before coming
to Shanghai that

33:39.126 --> 33:40.834
I will never become a gangster.

33:43.543 --> 33:48.209
I have heard that too many times.

33:48.543 --> 33:51.209
And every time I have to host the funeral.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.234
The only person who still survives,

33:54.918 --> 33:56.751
is only Long Qi.

33:57.251 --> 33:58.372
I am different from Long Qi.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.376
Of course you are different from him.

34:03.126 --> 34:05.001
He is the man of the town,

34:05.376 --> 34:07.043
and he knows the rules of the game.

34:08.083 --> 34:11.501
Yet, how long can he survive?

34:24.793 --> 34:28.833
Lights are up for the night,

34:28.833 --> 34:33.251
Everything is ready for us at the ball.

34:33.583 --> 34:38.667
Come, look at me in the eyes.

34:38.668 --> 34:43.668
They'll open your heart.

34:43.708 --> 34:47.625
A kiss is not enough for me,

34:47.626 --> 34:52.208
I want to fly high with you.

34:53.168 --> 35:01.168
We can fly to the edge
of the world together.

35:02.668 --> 35:07.834
Let's do it tonight!

35:39.001 --> 35:40.001
Brother Long.

35:40.251 --> 35:42.084
When will the Japanese's
stock be taken out?

35:42.168 --> 35:43.168
Tonight.

37:03.251 --> 37:06.084
You beat up all those guys at the back?

37:06.168 --> 37:07.168
Yes.

37:08.001 --> 37:09.521
You want a cut of the stock, I assume?

37:09.668 --> 37:10.668
Yes.

37:12.251 --> 37:13.251
And you are?

37:13.543 --> 37:14.584
Ma Yongzhen.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.543
Ma Yongzhen.

37:20.918 --> 37:23.043
Ma Yongzhen,
do you know whom you are talking to?

37:23.751 --> 37:24.751
I've seen you before.

37:24.918 --> 37:27.751
You're Long Qi. I heard that no one
can stand ten hits from you,

37:29.459 --> 37:30.459
but I think I could.

37:36.834 --> 37:38.395
I don't know what you mean by ten hits.

37:38.793 --> 37:43.084
Put it this way, if you don't lose

37:43.334 --> 37:47.251
before the cigarette burns out,
the stock is yours.

38:36.751 --> 38:38.151
Someone's gonna get hurt over this.

40:22.293 --> 40:23.414
The cigarette is almost out.

40:24.584 --> 40:25.665
Hurry up, it's burning out!

40:36.834 --> 40:37.834
Why did you stop?

40:38.168 --> 40:39.769
I am afraid I will kill you by accident.

40:40.918 --> 40:41.959
Didn't you hear your people screaming?

40:42.376 --> 40:44.793
The cigarette burned out.
The stock is mine.

40:51.918 --> 40:53.376
Ma Yongzhen.

41:08.043 --> 41:09.126
Do you have matches?

41:45.126 --> 41:50.543
You can't destroy opium by burning.
Use limewater next time.

41:54.459 --> 41:55.709
Long Qi, lighter.

41:57.751 --> 42:01.626
Keep it. Find me if anything happens.

42:19.334 --> 42:22.293
Who said the cigarette went out just now?

42:38.876 --> 42:39.918
Come on.

43:04.459 --> 43:06.209
Damn it.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.751
The whole lot got wrecked.

43:11.084 --> 43:15.084
I am the one left here to explain
when they come for their stock.

43:17.209 --> 43:21.918
You're lucky you are still survive.

43:23.209 --> 43:25.126
Just leave and be the hero.

43:25.334 --> 43:28.126
Don't get me into trouble. Leave.

43:53.126 --> 43:56.751
Brother Ma,
if you are going to hit somebody next time,

43:57.459 --> 43:58.793
think of your mother.

44:01.293 --> 44:05.209
The bracelet that your mother
gave you is not for decoration.

44:22.168 --> 44:24.375
Brother Ma. We will quit as well.

44:24.376 --> 44:25.334
From now on, let us work for you.

44:25.335 --> 44:26.876
Yes. Let us work for you.

44:31.751 --> 44:33.543
Brother Ma, we are quitting too.

44:33.918 --> 44:35.293
We will be your followers.

45:17.001 --> 45:18.168
Ma Yongzhen.

45:24.793 --> 45:25.833
I am not here to fight.

45:25.834 --> 45:27.251
You're not here to fight?

45:28.543 --> 45:30.958
You want to have a drink?
You should have told me earlier...

45:30.959 --> 45:34.043
Long Qi, are you hiring?

45:42.376 --> 45:44.084
What else do you know other than fighting?

45:45.876 --> 45:48.084
Sweeping, dish washing,
heavy lifting... anything,

45:48.251 --> 45:49.834
except hitting others for you.

45:56.834 --> 45:58.293
These are your followers?

45:59.293 --> 46:00.293
Yes.

46:00.876 --> 46:01.876
Wow, very impressive.

46:01.877 --> 46:03.459
You have followers already?

46:03.751 --> 46:04.751
How many of them?

46:07.668 --> 46:09.168
Six, including myself.

46:11.793 --> 46:13.334
Who's the one with a hat?

46:15.293 --> 46:18.043
He is a business man,
not a labourerlabourer.

46:18.251 --> 46:19.251
Oh.

46:20.126 --> 46:22.876
We can work for eighty cents a day,
does this work for you?

46:24.501 --> 46:26.459
I will give you guys two dollars. Come on.

46:42.209 --> 46:46.251
From now on, Ma Yongzhen is my friend.

46:46.918 --> 46:49.438
Let's welcome Ma Yongzhen and his buddies
to join Paradise Club.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.251
Great!

47:13.126 --> 47:14.126
From now on,

47:15.584 --> 47:18.418
no male here can light cigarettes
for this lady,

47:19.793 --> 47:20.793
except me.

47:38.334 --> 47:39.334
Music!

47:48.685 --> 47:49.685
Does it hurt?

47:49.709 --> 47:51.292
When I first came to Shanghai,

47:51.293 --> 47:55.209
I fought every day and
got injured every day.

47:55.418 --> 47:58.376
I am used to the pain to an extent
that I couldn't feel it anymore.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.523
Then why do you have to be like this?

48:05.376 --> 48:08.793
I gained everything I own today
through fighting..

48:09.751 --> 48:10.751
So what?

48:11.168 --> 48:13.209
Even if you own the entire Shanghai.

48:27.459 --> 48:28.876
You are still here in your lonesome

48:32.126 --> 48:34.876
Don't tell a lonely person

48:34.918 --> 48:35.918
how lonesome he is.

48:40.126 --> 48:43.626
I don't flirt, I don't sweet talk people,

48:44.376 --> 48:46.043
and I don't play tricks either.

48:46.668 --> 48:48.084
What do you like about me?

48:51.418 --> 48:54.334
Your arrogance.

48:58.251 --> 49:00.959
Dirty Triad Boss Long Qi &
Clean Ma Yongzhen Collaborate

49:34.168 --> 49:35.833
The girl dances very well.

49:35.834 --> 49:36.834
Not bad.

49:37.293 --> 49:40.668
But doesn't she look a little like you?

50:44.709 --> 50:45.750
What are you doing here?

50:45.751 --> 50:46.751
We are starving.

50:46.751 --> 50:47.501
Starving.

50:47.502 --> 50:48.584
You haven't eaten yet?

50:50.834 --> 50:54.251
Excuse me, soy milk for everyone.

52:00.293 --> 52:01.376
Let's play a bit.

52:14.334 --> 52:15.334
Ma Yongzhen

52:16.584 --> 52:18.418
Take it. Have it when you feel hungry

52:39.918 --> 52:40.918
What is this?

52:40.918 --> 52:41.918
Hot dog.

52:46.293 --> 52:47.668
You are sick.

52:49.584 --> 52:50.918
Don't you know anything?

52:51.459 --> 52:53.209
Try it. It's good.

52:53.584 --> 52:55.209
I'll tell you a story. In 1904,

52:55.876 --> 52:58.792
a German immigrant came to St. Louis
in the United States,

52:58.793 --> 53:01.334
selling wieners...

53:02.501 --> 53:04.376
are you listening?

53:04.709 --> 53:05.958
You want one?

53:05.959 --> 53:09.543
But they were hot and salty

53:09.668 --> 53:13.001
and not easy to hold, so...

53:15.793 --> 53:18.626
Is it good? Really?

53:18.751 --> 53:21.376
Haha

53:46.959 --> 53:47.959
Cool.

53:52.334 --> 53:55.043
Ma Yongzhen, why did you come to Shanghai?

53:57.626 --> 53:58.751
I am penniless.

54:00.084 --> 54:03.668
Everyone says Shanghai
is a land of opportunities.

54:04.209 --> 54:06.129
That's why I am here,
to get a piece of paradise.

54:09.959 --> 54:13.626
Ma Yongzhen, you shouldn't be like this.

54:14.209 --> 54:15.584
You are living in

54:15.626 --> 54:18.959
a shabby complex.

54:20.668 --> 54:24.251
You know what, if you know Kung Fu

54:24.918 --> 54:26.834
but refuse to follow a gangg,

54:27.334 --> 54:30.709
you will just become their enemy.

54:32.501 --> 54:35.084
Join me under my wing.

54:36.334 --> 54:42.251
My dream is to defeat the three wolves
of Axe Fraternity

54:43.293 --> 54:44.751
and drive away the Japanese.

54:52.334 --> 54:56.209
Sometimes people just need
to be taught a lesson.

54:59.959 --> 55:01.375
I can't do that.

55:01.376 --> 55:03.668
I can't join the Triad.

55:04.168 --> 55:05.168
But don't worry,

55:05.543 --> 55:08.793
we are brothers forever and ever.

55:11.959 --> 55:13.459
Why are you wearing a jade bracelet?

55:14.501 --> 55:17.251
I can kill a cow with one
strike from my fist.

55:17.334 --> 55:18.959
That's why my mom gave me this bracelet.

55:19.043 --> 55:20.751
Punching cows is meaningless.

55:20.876 --> 55:22.209
Do you know how many people I have killed?

55:22.418 --> 55:24.708
Old men, I have killed countless.

55:24.709 --> 55:26.667
Do you know how old Chen Mou was?

55:26.668 --> 55:27.959
He was older than my dad.

55:28.293 --> 55:31.376
You've killed lots of people,
but have you killed a cow before?

55:31.459 --> 55:32.459
Of course I have.

55:32.543 --> 55:33.668
I eat steak every day.

55:33.751 --> 55:34.584
I slaughter them myself.

55:34.626 --> 55:36.251
I have even eaten a tiger. I tell you...

55:45.959 --> 55:48.079
Do you know what time is it?
Why are you back so late?

55:48.959 --> 55:49.959
That's me.

55:55.043 --> 55:56.043
Low-life.

56:00.001 --> 56:05.334
I think it was because I
was not gentle enough

56:05.626 --> 56:10.793
I could not share your sorrow

56:11.251 --> 56:16.001
If it is hard to say aloud

56:16.334 --> 56:22.168
Then I will just keep
the regret in my heart

56:23.626 --> 56:28.709
Leave my sorrow to myself

56:29.501 --> 56:34.543
You can bring your beauty with you

56:35.001 --> 56:43.001
Will you think of me occasionally?

56:44.793 --> 56:50.418
Will you? Will you?

57:00.709 --> 57:03.209
I want to see you.
I will wait for you at the fountain.

57:14.418 --> 57:19.333
Don't stay out too late.

57:19.334 --> 57:20.334
Yes.

57:32.459 --> 57:33.751
What are you looking at?

57:35.501 --> 57:38.084
How's it taste?

57:41.477 --> 57:42.477
Is it good?

57:42.501 --> 57:44.126
Not bad. What is it?

57:44.209 --> 57:44.876
It's a hot dog.

57:44.877 --> 57:45.959
What?

57:47.918 --> 57:48.918
You're sick and cruel.

57:48.918 --> 57:49.918
Just listen.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.209
In 1904, there was a German immigrant
in the United States...

57:53.543 --> 57:54.959
Fine. Fine. Fine.

57:55.334 --> 57:56.668
Who told you all these?

57:56.709 --> 57:57.293
Long Qi.

57:57.334 --> 57:59.543
Long Qi, the one who
always fights and kills...

57:59.668 --> 58:01.084
He isn't a fighter or a killer.

58:01.293 --> 58:02.614
He just likes challenging others.

58:02.959 --> 58:05.543
I think Long Qi is quite a righteous man.

58:06.501 --> 58:09.793
Challenge? What challenge?
You guys like fighting around.

58:10.709 --> 58:13.208
Sometimes, people just got
to be taught a lesson.

58:13.209 --> 58:14.376
What are you talking about?

58:17.668 --> 58:21.584
Just stop fighting, will you?

58:26.126 --> 58:29.168
My dad hates people who fight.

58:31.959 --> 58:32.959
Alright.

58:37.501 --> 58:39.543
You look pretty today.

58:40.084 --> 58:41.084
Punk!

59:04.834 --> 59:05.918
What's on your mind?

59:08.209 --> 59:09.793
I promised Hashimoto

59:10.751 --> 59:13.543
to sing at the annual dinner
for the Chamber of Commerce of Japan.

59:15.418 --> 59:16.626
Are you scared of them?

59:19.876 --> 59:21.750
I am only a lowly songstress.

59:21.751 --> 59:23.208
I don't know much.

59:23.209 --> 59:24.959
My voice is my life.

59:26.334 --> 59:30.959
I am lucky enough to earn
a living by singing.

59:31.918 --> 59:34.543
You are here with me.
You need not scare of anybody.

59:35.376 --> 59:37.001
Why do you keep a tiger at home?

59:40.001 --> 59:41.543
'Cause I am also a beast myself.

59:45.751 --> 59:47.751
You were a beast,

59:47.959 --> 59:50.376
because you need a beast's
instinct to sense danger

59:50.584 --> 59:51.918
but after you met Ma Yongzhen,

59:52.501 --> 59:54.584
your human side appeared.

59:54.834 --> 59:56.708
Somehow I didn't feel as secure

59:56.709 --> 59:58.418
as before to be with you.

59:59.251 --> 01:00:01.251
I want to be your woman forever

01:00:01.459 --> 01:00:03.834
but you can't be the king
of Shanghai Bund forever.

01:00:04.584 --> 01:00:07.751
Let's leave Shanghai together, shall we?

01:00:22.168 --> 01:00:24.668
I am the Chairman of the Chamber
of Commerce of Japan,

01:00:25.293 --> 01:00:29.501
Hashimoto Hiroichi. Nice to meet you.

01:00:36.459 --> 01:00:39.376
Chairman of Chamber of Commerce?

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:44.084
So you are the head
of the secret agents, right?

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:47.763
Are you engaging in a war or in a business?

01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:51.918
We always admire Chinese culture.

01:00:52.876 --> 01:00:56.751
Of course, we hope we could collaborate
with China in business.

01:00:56.793 --> 01:00:58.793
So that's why you rob
when you can't get it, right?

01:00:59.793 --> 01:01:03.209
Speaking of robbery, Mr. Long Qi,

01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:05.626
you have robbed our Japanese tea leaves.

01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:08.001
If that was really tea leaves,

01:01:09.543 --> 01:01:10.418
I would not have taken them from you.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:16.126
Yes, that was tens of cartons of opium,
it's priceless.

01:01:17.709 --> 01:01:18.709
Why did you burn them?

01:01:27.209 --> 01:01:29.626
Well, I didn't know why.

01:01:31.043 --> 01:01:32.876
I felt good doing it.

01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:39.370
Just like you Japanese massacred our Chinese
in the North-Eastern part of China.

01:01:42.709 --> 01:01:46.001
Mr. Long Qi, that is war.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:50.515
Once there is war, it is inevitable
to cause injury to the innocent.

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:55.751
That's not war. That's blatant invasion.

01:01:59.543 --> 01:02:02.250
Mr. Long Qi, we deeply
admire your character.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:07.251
I sincerely hope that we can
collaborate closely one day.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:09.334
You have to read between lines

01:02:12.376 --> 01:02:14.001
when negotiating with the Japanese.

01:02:14.793 --> 01:02:16.084
Admire my character

01:02:17.418 --> 01:02:19.959
and look forward to close collaboration...

01:02:22.376 --> 01:02:24.084
Can these be translated as:

01:02:25.543 --> 01:02:28.959
I am an influential man.

01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:34.834
Bribe me so that I would betray my country?

01:02:45.626 --> 01:02:48.293
Chinese are no longer
"Sick Men of East Asia".

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:52.584
Please get out of here.

01:02:55.001 --> 01:02:59.209
Mr. Long Qi, if you have
to say it this way,

01:03:00.793 --> 01:03:02.673
then there will only be
one way for this to end.

01:03:08.334 --> 01:03:09.459
By the way.

01:03:10.084 --> 01:03:11.833
Sheng Xiangjun won't be singing

01:03:11.834 --> 01:03:13.501
at your Chamber's annual dinner

01:03:13.793 --> 01:03:14.793
because Paradise Club

01:03:14.794 --> 01:03:18.293
will be celebrating our 100th day
that same evening.

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:23.376
Long Qi, you really think
you are the king of Shanghai.

01:03:23.626 --> 01:03:26.418
He is almost the king of Shanghai.

01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:31.751
So, who will be the king of Shanghai?

01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:36.001
All of us sitting here today are friends.

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.501
That is, we share the same enemy.

01:03:43.209 --> 01:03:47.376
That's why we should work together...

01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:50.626
How?

01:03:51.376 --> 01:03:52.626
Finish Long Qi.

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:57.418
Find Ma Yongzhen.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:59.542
We can make good use of this guy.

01:03:59.543 --> 01:04:00.958
I found him already.

01:04:00.959 --> 01:04:03.418
He is with Tie at North Gate.

01:04:20.084 --> 01:04:23.959
I knew this would happen one day.
Get in the car.

01:04:35.209 --> 01:04:39.209
Brother Tie, how have you
been all these years?

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.084
Could be better.

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:43.626
That's not good then.

01:04:43.876 --> 01:04:45.584
Are you planning an uprising again?

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:47.043
It is not my intention.

01:04:47.126 --> 01:04:47.751
Tie,

01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:49.418
Ma Yongzhen from North Gate
robbed our shipment

01:04:49.459 --> 01:04:51.334
and formed a secret alliance

01:04:51.501 --> 01:04:54.709
with Long Qi. Their alliance is obvious.

01:04:55.834 --> 01:04:58.293
I am only a lowly acrobat.

01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:01.039
I won't be able to get involved
in any of your deals.

01:05:01.293 --> 01:05:02.376
Brother Tie,

01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:07.418
you have trained Ma Yongzhen so well

01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:10.959
and his relationship with Long Qi is good.

01:05:11.168 --> 01:05:14.501
He has nothing to do with Long Qi.
He only works for him.

01:05:14.584 --> 01:05:17.376
Tie, I will be honest with you then.

01:05:18.043 --> 01:05:20.501
We would like to use him to get rid of
Long Qi for us.

01:05:22.626 --> 01:05:25.834
Other than that,
we will leave it to our friend, Ma.

01:05:26.584 --> 01:05:30.918
There is an old Chinese saying: smart people
do the right thing at the right time.

01:05:32.168 --> 01:05:34.209
The power of Great Japan
is expanding in Shanghai.

01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:36.376
We shouldn't disregard them.

01:05:37.418 --> 01:05:41.376
We should work with them
to gain some advantage.

01:05:42.918 --> 01:05:44.293
What do you think, my friend?

01:05:44.584 --> 01:05:47.209
You collude with the Japanese
to invade your own country;

01:05:47.626 --> 01:05:50.543
you betray our people's dignity
to your own advantages.

01:05:51.293 --> 01:05:53.376
I will be a bastard if I work for you.

01:05:54.376 --> 01:05:57.126
I will be a traitor if I collude with you.

01:05:57.626 --> 01:06:00.209
But I am neither of those.

01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:03.043
You know, what you have just said

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.293
will put many people's lives in danger?

01:06:04.501 --> 01:06:07.209
Ruining others' families
is your way of life.

01:06:07.376 --> 01:06:08.709
I am by myself.

01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:10.572
I will not be threatened by that.

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.802
So you decided to take
it all up by yourself?

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.543
His problem is my problem.

01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:29.584
Tie, we have given you much face today.

01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:32.334
Don't think that you are
still our big brother.

01:06:33.751 --> 01:06:34.751
You have been hiding for over ten years

01:06:34.752 --> 01:06:37.084
after your wife's death.

01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:41.043
You silly old bag,

01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:45.251
you are going to get killed
for guarding this young chap.

01:06:46.584 --> 01:06:47.918
Ma Yongzhen is my son-in-law.

01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:51.043
He is my youngest daughter's fianc?

01:06:52.126 --> 01:06:54.084
He is here to marry her.

01:06:54.376 --> 01:06:57.459
He will leave Shanghai
before the last ferry tonight

01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:00.121
and will not get involved
in your business ever after.

01:07:00.501 --> 01:07:02.584
I apologize for

01:07:04.876 --> 01:07:06.293
what he has done.

01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:08.293
Please forgive him.

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:11.543
Does it mean we won't see him ever again?

01:07:12.543 --> 01:07:15.103
I guarantee he will not get involved
in your business ever again.

01:07:22.209 --> 01:07:24.293
Master Tie,
why do we need to be scared of them?

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:30.751
It's no longer your problem now.

01:07:33.459 --> 01:07:35.168
You have to leave Shanghai straight away!

01:07:52.084 --> 01:07:53.084
What's wrong?

01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:56.834
Brother Long, Brother
Long, please sign here.

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:47.709
Let's go... Let's pack up and hurry.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:16.542
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:09:34.334 --> 01:09:35.334
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:52.459
Get rid of him.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:46.293
Dad... sis.

01:11:49.793 --> 01:11:57.793
Dad...

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:22.293
Mr. Hashimoto had wasted money on you.

01:12:23.459 --> 01:12:26.459
Yes. I regret what I have done

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:28.168
Why?

01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:32.501
You will never understand

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:56.876
Long Qi.

01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:16.501
Leave Shanghai quickly.
Live long, my brother.

01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:22.876
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:14:14.251 --> 01:14:17.001
Long Qi, Long Qi.

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:23.376
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:30.876
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:14:33.834 --> 01:14:34.834
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:43.293
<i>Long Q“.!</i>

01:14:46.168 --> 01:14:47.626
Long Qi.

01:14:59.168 --> 01:15:00.168
Long Qi.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.168
We can be brothers again in our next life.

01:15:10.626 --> 01:15:13.584
Long Qi, Long Qi.

01:15:17.793 --> 01:15:22.709
Long Qi... l... admire you.

01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:25.376
I fear being an ordinary man,

01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:28.501
being forced to live under the ruling
of westerners and Japanese.

01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:32.584
Long Qi.

01:16:21.418 --> 01:16:25.126
Master Tie...

01:16:30.209 --> 01:16:36.542
Stop fighting. Just stand by your beloved.

01:16:36.543 --> 01:16:40.168
And let her live peacefully.

01:16:41.626 --> 01:16:45.459
That's a man's responsibility.

01:16:45.918 --> 01:16:48.251
No more fighting...

01:17:33.584 --> 01:17:38.168
From now on, Long Qi has ceased
to exist in Shanghai!

01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:42.168
It's our world now.

01:17:43.334 --> 01:17:45.501
No, Shanghai,

01:17:45.834 --> 01:17:48.234
and the Great East Asia as well,
will be under Japanese rule.

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:50.584
It will be our world.

01:17:50.959 --> 01:17:52.668
From now on,

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:55.459
the territories occupied
by the Axe Fraternity will fall

01:17:56.543 --> 01:17:59.043
under the Chamber of Commerce of Japan.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.126
The annual levy is 80%.

01:18:02.543 --> 01:18:05.751
We will guarantee the prosperity
and security of your businesses.

01:18:09.793 --> 01:18:13.543
You have no other options.

01:18:27.959 --> 01:18:29.709
Though you have great manpower,

01:18:30.626 --> 01:18:31.876
you are totally disorganized.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:35.709
I will finish off anyone that

01:18:36.418 --> 01:18:38.334
you can't handle anyway.

01:21:26.668 --> 01:21:28.668
Is this yours?

01:25:50.334 --> 01:25:51.584
Ma Yongzhen...

01:25:56.459 --> 01:25:57.834
Ma Yongzhen...

01:26:00.626 --> 01:26:03.168
Some people just need to get beaten up!

01:26:33.876 --> 01:26:37.501
Ma Yongzhen, as you can see,

01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:39.209
my plan has brought us this far...

01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:40.793
Get the hell out of China!

01:29:36.209 --> 01:29:39.334
Ma Yongzhen, listen.

01:29:42.084 --> 01:29:44.084
I want you to come back in one piece.

01:29:46.126 --> 01:29:48.668
You are my only family member from now on.

01:29:51.251 --> 01:29:55.501
