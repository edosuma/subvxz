WEBVTT

02:19.848 --> 02:21.391
God.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.449
Huzzah!

02:38.533 --> 02:41.494
Thank you, God.
Phew!

03:01.681 --> 03:03.099
Thanks.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.609
Ladies...

03:12.692 --> 03:13.943
KEG men!

03:37.634 --> 03:39.677
See you guys.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.722
Hey, Dad.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.474
Conventions are all about
networking, son. Remember that.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.808
It's good to see
you, too, Dad.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.310
{\an1}Ah, come up
and see the hacienda

03:47.393 --> 03:48.811
{\an1}I got you before
you give me attitude.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.313
{\an1}Here's your KEG pin.
Thanks.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.655
{\an3}Oh, a view

03:58.738 --> 04:01.616
of the pool, nice.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.451
Keep your eyes in
your head, sonny boy.

04:03.534 --> 04:04.619
Your social calendar's

04:04.702 --> 04:05.662
filled up this weekend.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.497
Don't even tell me you
fixed me up with someone.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.291
Yes, matter of fact, I have.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.168
Her name is Robin Wallace.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.545
Her father's a major alum down
at the KEG house in Florida.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.672
{\an3}You're kidding?
Mm-mm.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.839
Dad, the last thing in the world
I want is a blind date.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.091
Are you kidding?

04:19.175 --> 04:21.803
Look at the eyeball candy down
there, I want to be accessible.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.514
Will you forget it?
She's an Alpha. You'll like her.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.141
Welcome to Casa KEG.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.810
Casa KEG...

04:31.437 --> 04:32.855
(chuckles)

04:39.112 --> 04:40.989
Yeah, this is, uh,
this is adequate.

04:41.072 --> 04:41.990
Hey, Sanders...

04:42.073 --> 04:43.866
I got your adequate.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.701
Muntz, what's up, man?
Hey!

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
{\an1}Hey, man, your dad
really came through.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.539
Didn't I tell you never to say
anything nice in front of him?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.249
Will you get off my back?

04:51.332 --> 04:52.208
What's with the sody pop?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.918
{\an1}Oh, hey, hey, hey, those
labels aren't dry yet.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.004
Labels?
Oh, Muntz, Muntz...

04:56.087 --> 04:57.422
{\an3}Oh, Muntz,
concealed brewskie?

04:57.505 --> 04:59.507
{\an5}You're a chip off
the old frat.
You're a madman.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.466
Oh, hey, Steve, Brandon called.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.677
Said he's not going
to be able to make it.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.221
{\an3}Uh-uh, that's
not acceptable.

05:05.304 --> 05:06.139
No way.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.891
{\an1}Forget about it.
He's not in the fraternity.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.351
Dad, he lost the election,

05:10.435 --> 05:11.769
{\an3}his parents are
moving to Hong Kong,

05:11.853 --> 05:13.563
and Kelly dumped him.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.565
He needs KEG now more than ever.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.236
Hi, what we have here

05:20.319 --> 05:23.531
is a spacious Spanish, in the
flats, lots of homey charm.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.366
{\an5}STEVE:
Yeah, who cares?
Where's Brandon Walsh?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.784
What agency is he with?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.369
{\an1}BRANDON:
Hey, hang up out there.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.371
Oh, sorry.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.706
It's me, bro, what's up?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.249
Hey, what's going on over there?

05:33.332 --> 05:34.417
Having another going-away
party or something?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.376
It's called a caravan.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.545
30 commission-hungry
real estate brokers

05:37.628 --> 05:39.422
complaining about our lack
of closet space.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.549
That's all the more reason
you should be here.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.718
Steve, there's just too much
going on here for me to cut out.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.844
My parents are leaving today.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.430
Well, perfect. Because nothing
starts until tomorrow.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.723
Ain't going to happen.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.517
Okay. Okay, but just assure me
this has nothing to do with the

05:51.601 --> 05:53.269
fact that Kelly
will be out here.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.812
Look, I just started
to load the car.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.773
I gotta get their luggage
to the terminal early.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.274
All right, man.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.651
But if you change your mind,
you come running, okay?

06:00.735 --> 06:01.778
We'll be here.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.113
Yeah, thanks, bro.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.115
Jim, come look.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.533
Kelly is so sweet.
She brought us

06:07.617 --> 06:08.951
a going-away present.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.453
I got it at the
Farmer's Market.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.788
{\an1}I just didn't want
you to forget

06:11.871 --> 06:14.290
{\an1}your zip code.
Oh, we appreciate it.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.666
We're going to
miss you guys.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.752
Oh, we'll miss you, too.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.505
Hey, guys, I gotta start
loading the car, huh?

06:20.588 --> 06:22.381
You know, honey, I'm
not finished packing.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.966
{\an3}I don't think you
are either, sweetie.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.176
{\an1}Uh, yeah.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.430
It's weird to see a "for
sale" sign in your yard.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.182
I'm getting used to it.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.600
I heard from Steve
that you're going

06:32.683 --> 06:33.935
to Palm Springs with the KEGers.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.978
No.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.271
You should go.
You'll have fun.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.816
I'm not really up
for a good time right now.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.984
Brandon, just because I didn't
want to move in and get married

06:42.068 --> 06:43.277
right away doesn't mean
I still don't want

06:43.361 --> 06:44.320
a relationship with you.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.988
What are you talking about?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.157
I proposed, you said, "no."
End of conversation.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.993
{\an6}VALERIE:
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.995
I just wanted to get
the plans straight.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.331
We are going to the Peach Pit
for supper, right?

06:55.414 --> 06:56.499
{\an3}Yeah.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.334
{\an3}VALERIE: Well, I'll be over at
Dylan's if anybody needs me.

06:58.417 --> 07:04.549
Tell him I said hi.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.884
Should I give him
your regards, too?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.178
That won't be necessary.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.807
{\an3}You know, I'd love to stay
here and referee, guys, but...

07:19.522 --> 07:21.357
{\an3}You know, we should call
you The Terminator.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.359
I mean, who else
could knock out

07:23.442 --> 07:25.444
two guys with one shot?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.586
{\an5}DONNA:
"So it gives me great pride
to stand before you,

07:41.669 --> 07:43.212
{\an3}"one of the new breed
of Alpha women.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.297
Independent, involved..."

07:44.380 --> 07:46.382
Brave, clean, reverent.

07:46.465 --> 07:48.342
{\an3}I was just getting
into it.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.011
Donna, the delivery is fine.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.346
It just sounds too much
like the Boy Scout Oath.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.223
{\an3}Well, we can't keep
rewriting it forever.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.726
You know, I think, uh...
Clare and I

07:56.809 --> 07:59.020
just can't quite connect on
this whole sorority thing.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.564
Yeah. After boarding school,

08:01.647 --> 08:04.233
I kind of have trouble believing
large groups of women

08:04.317 --> 08:07.737
can live under the same roof
without killing each other.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.197
{\an3}Ah, Kelly, I'm glad
you're here.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.740
{\an3}I need someone to stick
up for sisterhood.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.867
{\an1}I am so frustrated.
Some jerk took

08:12.950 --> 08:15.244
my parking place again.
Does "three strikes you're out"

08:15.328 --> 08:17.246
apply to parking offenses?
Because it should.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.958
{\an3}So, I gather it didn't go
too well at Brandon's, huh?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.960
One good thing about them moving
out of that house

08:23.044 --> 08:25.421
is that it's one less place I
will have to run into Valerie.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.256
{\an1}Mmm, no arguments from anyone
in this room.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.257
Hmm...

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
Guys, give the girl a break.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.636
All right. How're you making out
with the big speech?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.264
{\an3}Well, I have a feeling you
and I will be writing it

08:35.347 --> 08:36.890
{\an3}on the way down
to Palm Springs tomorrow.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.100
You know what, I think we're

08:38.183 --> 08:39.101
gonna have to take
separate cars.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.144
{\an1}Kel.
I'm sorry, I can't

08:40.227 --> 08:42.270
make it till the second day of
the convention.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.106
What's so important
that you can't come?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.442
It's nothing. Don't worry, I
will be there in time for

08:46.525 --> 08:48.319
{\an1}your speech.
Well, if it's nothing,

08:48.402 --> 08:50.112
why can't you
just say what it is?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.406
Because it's private.

08:52.490 --> 08:53.449
Forget I even mentioned it.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.742
(phone ringing)

08:54.825 --> 08:56.410
Oh...

08:56.494 --> 08:58.246
If that's Ray,
I'm not here.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.164
Hello.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.707
You're safe. It's my dad.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.170
{\an5}LUANN:
<i>Pretty serious</i>
<i>sounding tune there.</i>

09:06.254 --> 09:09.006
I've been thinking about some
pretty serious stuff.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.635
Don't tell me,
Newt's Contract with America?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.512
{\an1}(chuckles)

09:14.595 --> 09:16.138
About, uh... about you and Dad.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.184
Oh.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.478
I guess couples fight, huh?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.480
People close to each other

09:24.563 --> 09:26.983
are going to have their
share of disagreements.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.111
Of course, your father and
I had more than our share.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.322
Well, I know he used
to push you around.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.991
That man didn't
"push me around."

09:35.074 --> 09:36.826
He hit me.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.035
There's a big difference.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.413
You never pressed
charges, though.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.040
He said he loved me.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.002
He said he was gonna fall
all to pieces without me.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.087
You should have heard him.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.006
He made it sound
real convincing.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.134
Now you answer
me a question.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.178
{\an1}What kind of troubles are
you having with Donna?

09:58.264 --> 10:01.684
{\an3}I said a lot of things
I wish I hadn't.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.312
{\an1}And you're trying to
sing your way out of it?

10:04.395 --> 10:06.147
You think it won't work?

10:06.230 --> 10:10.359
{\an1}Well... with a girl as
romantic as Donna...

10:10.443 --> 10:12.320
you got a pretty good chance.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.242
{\an5}VALERIE:
<i>Everywhere I go today</i>
<i>someone's packing.</i>

10:18.326 --> 10:20.703
{\an3}Yeah, well, see,
we were all trying

10:20.786 --> 10:22.038
{\an3}to escape from you,
Valerie.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.039
(chuckles sarcastically)

10:23.122 --> 10:25.374
{\an1}I thought you were
just fleeing

10:25.458 --> 10:26.584
from Hurricane Kelly.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.670
Actually, I think it's great
that you're gonna spend a month

10:29.754 --> 10:30.755
in Maui with your mom.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.590
{\an3}Forget about that. I'm stoked
about seeing Erica.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.176
{\an3}You know, a year ago,
my little munchkin princess

10:35.259 --> 10:37.553
couldn't even swim, and now
she's giving me the surf report.

10:37.636 --> 10:38.429
Well, send them my best.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.430
{\an3}I will.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.390
You know, I'm a little surprised
you didn't try

10:41.474 --> 10:42.516
to weasel yourself a ticket
this time.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.061
I just can't leave Brandon alone
with the house and all.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.438
Brandon's a big boy, I think
he can take care of himself.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.397
It's just an act.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.566
I mean, the Kelly thing
really shook him up.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.610
I'm just trying to be there
for him, Dylan.

10:52.693 --> 10:56.405
Oh, yeah, you're trying to be
there for Brandon now, are you?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.949
Well, I didn't hear you offering
to take me around the world.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.534
(knocking)
Well...

11:00.618 --> 11:03.454
Oh, that's Charley.
Airport Express. Lucky me.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.622
Hey, man, you're early.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.082
The plane's not till 6:00.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.458
Change o' plans.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.335
You are not going.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.419
What do you mean, I'm not going?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.420
If you sell the script,

11:11.504 --> 11:13.130
I'll come back.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
I think he sold the script.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.801
Not exactly.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.929
{\an3}But some independent money
has stepped up to the plate.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.305
So, take a meeting
with them, man.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.348
You don't need me for that.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.768
Get this. One of 'em
is a paragliding company.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.603
{\an3}They love the chase scene
that you wrote.

11:27.686 --> 11:30.606
They want to give you a
demonstration tomorrow.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.441
I get to fly this paraglider?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.902
You about ready to cancel that
reservation for the luau now?

11:34.985 --> 11:35.986
Yeah.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.204
I can't believe
you're getting so emotional.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.580
Ever since Brandon said
you wanted

11:46.664 --> 11:47.915
to have your last supper here,

11:47.998 --> 11:49.750
{\an1}I started
to feel a little eggy.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.293
He's been cutting onions
all day, Dad.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.670
Don't believe a word of this.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.296
{\an3}(chuckles)

11:54.380 --> 11:55.589
{\an1}You've been great
to me, Jim.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.133
I mean, every time

11:57.216 --> 12:00.302
I got in trouble with this
place, you've always been there.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.054
You've been great to my kids.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.307
Jim, would you come on over here
and sit down, honey?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.018
We have a lot of loose ends
to go over.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.272
{\an3}Yeah, the loosest
of which is Valerie.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.816
Ah, yes, well, I spoke
to Abby and she knows

12:13.899 --> 12:15.276
{\an1}that Valerie has
to find her own place.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.361
{\an1}But for the time being
she'll be staying with you.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.654
No problem.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.365
And this "open house" stuff, it
should calm down by next week.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.451
It could take months
to sell the house, though.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.660
I can handle it.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.328
Brandon, you're a rock.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.330
Thanks, Mom.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.999
{\an1}No, with all that you've been
going through lately,

12:30.082 --> 12:32.334
{\an1}I mean, a lot of people would
just fall apart

12:32.418 --> 12:33.210
or do something stupid.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.172
Speaking of people
doing stupid things,

12:36.255 --> 12:40.217
would you keep an eye on Valerie
and, uh, the incense burning?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.510
Yeah.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.721
{\an1}Try to be a good influence
on her, dear.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.514
One role model coming up.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.849
(door closes)

12:46.932 --> 12:47.850
Hey.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.976
{\an3}JIM:
Hey.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.520
Well, the house is gonna be
empty without you guys.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.648
{\an1}Oh, well,
we're gonna miss you, too.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.193
Can we save the good-byes until
we're at the airport, maybe?

12:57.276 --> 12:58.235
{\an1}Honey,
I can't help it.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.862
{\an1}I feel like we're
deserting you.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.364
{\an3}No, you're not.
I'll be fine. Dad? Dad?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
Is this a group grope?
Can anybody get in?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.410
Hey!

13:07.161 --> 13:09.788
Go ahead and yell at me
if you want.

13:09.872 --> 13:16.420
Just say something.

13:16.504 --> 13:20.049
It's a beautiful song.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.384
{\an3}And I think we've
done enough yelling.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.054
{\an1}I know.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.680
{\an1}I don't know what happened
last week.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.517
I just, uh, I snapped.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.230
You scared me, you really did.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.232
Don't you think I scared myself?

13:36.315 --> 13:39.360
I mean, the last thing
I want to do is hurt you.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.444
I love you.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.573
I know you do.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.534
I know, but, uh...

13:46.617 --> 13:48.369
Look, I didn't know how much I
needed you.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.205
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to get you back.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.629
Well...

13:58.712 --> 14:00.714
if you come with me
to Palm Springs,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.758
sit with me in the sun

14:02.841 --> 14:05.302
and cheer me on
during my speech, yeah,

14:05.386 --> 14:06.971
I think, I think
that would help.

14:07.054 --> 14:07.930
You want me to

14:08.013 --> 14:10.099
come to Palm Springs
to the Alpha Convention?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.934
A lot of people
are bringing guests.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.231
You did say whatever it takes.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.692
In that case,
I can't wait to go.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.111
Great.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.073
Home, sweet home.

14:26.156 --> 14:26.949
{\an1}Yep.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.285
{\an3}Brandon, will you stop
shutting me out?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.619
{\an1}I'm not.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.997
{\an3}You hardly talked on the way
back from the airport.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.791
So, there are a few things
I'd rather not talk about.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.294
Okay, fine.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.629
Look, I know things seem
to be dark,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.965
but you got to look
for the silver lining.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.092
You're right.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.969
I haven't been attacked by
the flesh-eating bacteria yet.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.221
{\an3}Tell them about maybe
the teak floors

14:49.305 --> 14:51.265
{\an3}and the schools.
Don't forget the schools.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.142
Excuse me.
W-What are you doing here?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.310
Oh, I know it's late,

14:54.393 --> 14:57.146
but real estate
is a 24-hour business.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.982
The Chus are moving here
from Hong Kong.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.650
Isn't that a coincidence?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.820
{\an1}It is a small world,
after all.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.113
I think they're motivated.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.407
But if it's not them,
it'll be someone else.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.284
We're gonna do such a blitz
this weekend.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.327
Great. Guys,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
thanks for coming, okay?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.039
{\an1}All right.
Yes. Let's go, people.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.123
Good night.
Good night.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.124
Good-bye.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.125
Good night.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.960
So as I was saying...

15:20.044 --> 15:22.838
I don't think I can take
a blitzer this weekend.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.132
I may just go up to the desert
and see Steve.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.176
Well, if you don't want
to travel alone,

15:27.259 --> 15:29.803
{\an1}I've never been
to the desert

15:29.887 --> 15:32.306
and we could take my car.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.849
I'll let you drive.

15:33.932 --> 15:37.519
Well, since you put it that way.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.647
Then it's settled.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.566
Well, I don't know about you,
but I think I'm gonna turn in.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.193
Sleep tight.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.279
Who said anything about sleep?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.382
{\an3}Hi. I'm here to pick up
Alison Lash.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.591
{\an3}She's supposed
to be released today.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.842
Oh, I remember you.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.679
{\an1}I guess you two
patched things up.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.638
That's nice.

16:12.721 --> 16:17.643
Oh, no, no, I'm not...
We're just friends.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.564
So, can you tell me
what to expect?

16:22.648 --> 16:23.732
Is she really badly scarred?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.360
{\an6}No, not really.
She's just uncomfortable.
Kelly.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.615
Oh, my goodness.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.575
Hi! Look at you!

16:33.659 --> 16:36.328
{\an3}Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

16:36.412 --> 16:37.287
{\an1}Yeah.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.080
You look great.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.081
Well, you wouldn't
be saying that

16:39.164 --> 16:41.083
if you could see the skin grafts
on my legs.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.751
But your face, it's amazing.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.546
Almost all second-degree burns.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.423
I was blessed.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.258
Should we go?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.259
{\an1}Okay.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.468
I'll get your bag.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.679
{\an1}Hey, are you absolutely sure
that it's okay

16:53.762 --> 16:54.596
for me to stay at your place?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.807
I mean, your roommates were cool
about it?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.600
{\an3}My roommates are all
in Palm Springs.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.270
Good, 'cause it could be sort
of awkward with them around.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.981
Bye, Evelyn.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.108
Thank you so much
for everything.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.233
Bye, sweetheart.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.069
{\an1}Kelly, you take good care
of her.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.114
I will.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.324
{\an3}Bye.

17:14.407 --> 17:18.203
{\an5}WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Garcia, please call
extension 4024.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.832
Dr. Garcia, please call
extension 4024.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.472
{\an1}RUSH:
Oh, nice shot, Steve.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.516
{\an3}Well, Buddy, you gave us
a rough time.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.310
{\an3}Personally, I think you
caught us a little jetlagged.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.311
{\an3}Could be.
What do you think, Robin?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.480
{\an3}I think Steve has a really
awesome backhand.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.522
Well, thanks.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.774
Do you give lessons?

17:46.857 --> 17:48.108
Lessons? Me?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.151
No. Andre Agassi.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.027
My bashful son

17:50.110 --> 17:52.154
{\an3}Steve will teach you
whatever you want.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.906
Thanks, that'd be great.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.032
In the meantime,
up at the grill,

17:55.115 --> 17:56.700
there's a huge breakfast omelet
with our names on it.

17:56.784 --> 17:57.701
So how about it?

17:57.785 --> 17:58.952
{\an1}Great.
Great.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.162
Yo, Sanders!

18:00.245 --> 18:02.289
Brando, you made it.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.874
{\an4}VALERIE:
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Rush.

18:03.957 --> 18:04.875
Hey, Rush.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.794
{\an3}Hey, Val. They're some
kids from C.U. Hey, Val,

18:06.877 --> 18:08.295
come on over. I want to
introduce you to some people.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.214
{\an3}You said I should
come on up, brother.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.132
I'm so glad
you're here.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
{\an1}My father's set me up
on a blind date.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.011
{\an1}He is so annoying,
Brandon.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.554
{\an3}ROBIN:
Hi, nice to meet you.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.516
{\an4}BRANDON:
Are you sure?
'Cause where I'm standing,

18:20.599 --> 18:22.559
she looks <i> fine.</i>

18:23.644 --> 18:26.230
Steve, you and Brandon gonna
join us or not?

18:26.313 --> 18:27.147
Uh, you know what?

18:27.231 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}I'm gonna get him settled
in the hacienda.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.399
{\an1}Catch up
with you later, okay?

18:29.483 --> 18:30.359
Have fun.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.194
See you guys.
Bye.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.780
{\an3}Every date Rush
has ever set me up with

18:34.863 --> 18:36.490
has had major baggage.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.075
{\an3}One girl's father
was suing him.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.369
{\an3}Another girl's mom
he was trying to date.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.912
{\an3}I'm telling you,
the list is endless.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.038
Maybe you're overreacting.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.082
Rush doesn't change.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.792
{\an3}There's always an angle
with him.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.753
Ah! You think you've got
problems with your dates.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.380
{\an3}What? Not you and
the vampiress?

18:51.463 --> 18:52.548
Bro, I'm telling you.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.842
{\an1}All last night I can hear her
breathing in the next room,

18:54.925 --> 18:57.344
waiting for me to come in there
and handle her action.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.721
Well, she's been breathing in
the next room all year long.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.889
{\an3}Maybe <i> you're</i> the one
overreacting.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.391
I don't think so.
Howdy-do, amigos?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.392
{\an3}Muntz.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.060
<i>Hola,</i> Muntz.
New look?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.728
{\an4}Nah, I just wanted
to be packing.
Uh-huh

19:06.812 --> 19:08.730
I got margaritas
in one holster,

19:08.814 --> 19:10.274
sloe gin fizz
in the other.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.275
Who wants a squirt?

19:11.358 --> 19:13.151
We do. Give it up.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.779
Uh-uh-uh! Mm!

19:15.863 --> 19:16.613
No, none for me.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.198
{\an3}Brandon, are you sure
about this?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.741
I mean, you're the one

19:19.825 --> 19:22.953
{\an3}with the man-eater
snapping at your tail.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.371
{\an1}Seldom wrong,
and right again, Steve.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.373
{\an1}Hit me with a little bit
of that gin.

19:28.959 --> 19:29.751
{\an3}Huh?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.795
Give me some more of that.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.754
{\an1}Atta boy.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.923
{\an3}Brando came to party.
Let's go get some.

19:35.007 --> 19:35.966

20:24.848 --> 20:26.058
Come on.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.271
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A. system)

20:31.355 --> 20:34.775
{\an3}Well, you have to admit,
it is incredible here.

20:34.858 --> 20:35.984
Yeah.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.653
{\an3}I thought you
liked the desert.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.987
Yeah, I like the desert.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.989
Riding horses with my uncle,

20:41.073 --> 20:44.159
there wasn't any guy
in a uniform parking my truck.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.535
So we'll ride.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.245
{\an3}JILL:
Hi, Donna!

20:47.329 --> 20:48.956
{\an3}Hi, Jill!

20:49.039 --> 20:50.999
I just don't know anybody here.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.335
Well, you know me,
and you know Steve--

20:53.418 --> 20:55.963
{\an3}who's happy to let you crash
at his place, by the way.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.839
{\an3}Donna. Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, Mom.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.967
Well, what a surprise
to see you here.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.052
Donna convinced me
to come up for a few days,

21:02.135 --> 21:03.261
catch her speech.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.346
Ah, really?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.889
{\an1}Well, I trust
she also explained

21:05.973 --> 21:07.516
{\an1}that her dance card
is pretty full.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.018
{\an3}I mean, after all, this
is a KEG-Alpha event.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.020
{\an1}Mother.
Well, fine, honey.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.314
{\an1}I just didn't want him
to feel left out.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.691
No, if he feels left out,
he'll let you know.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.526
(chuckles):
Good.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.777
Excuse me.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.571
Oh...

21:21.655 --> 21:24.616
(rock music playing)

21:31.790 --> 21:32.708
Muntz, hit me.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.376
Again?
Hit me.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.460
{\an3}I don't know, man,
I have to

21:35.544 --> 21:37.713
{\an5}cut you off
pretty soon.
Muntz, hit me! Hit me!

21:38.422 --> 21:39.423
Ah, ah, ah!

21:39.506 --> 21:41.174
Thanks, man. Yo, Raymond.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.718
Great tunes, huh, bud?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.261
{\an3}Ha-ha!

21:45.637 --> 21:47.264
Somebody's toasted.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.599
(people whooping)

21:49.683 --> 21:51.518
I'll take that,
I'll take that.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.894
Ready, guys?

21:57.691 --> 22:00.569
{\an1}Game point. Here we
go, guys-- concentrate.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.404
Whoa!

22:02.487 --> 22:03.697
(cheering)

22:03.780 --> 22:04.740
Brandon!

22:06.283 --> 22:08.076
(laughs):
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

22:08.160 --> 22:09.077
{\an1}Hey, man, we're one point
away from victory here.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.829
Eh, victory sucks!

22:16.460 --> 22:20.005
(grunting)

22:24.509 --> 22:26.595
(yells)

22:30.015 --> 22:31.767
(yells)

22:31.850 --> 22:33.769
{\an1}Is Brandon always
like this?

22:33.852 --> 22:36.938
{\an3}(laughs):
He's never like this.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.774
{\an1}Well, uh,
what about Steve?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.942
{\an1}I mean, he does
like girls, right?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.613
{\an3}I'd have to say
Steve <i> loves</i> girls.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.035
{\an3}If you're interested,
I'd go for it.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.290
{\an1}Okay, come on,
are we ready

22:55.373 --> 22:56.750
{\an1}to play a little
volleyball, or what?

22:56.833 --> 22:58.710
{\an3}(indistinct shouts)
Yeah!

23:00.545 --> 23:02.798
Okay, okay, I see
what you're doing.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.049
{\an1}Take this.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.803
(others whooping)

23:07.886 --> 23:10.263
(European accent): Of course you
know, you've broken practically

23:10.347 --> 23:11.807
every volleyball rule
known to man.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.725
Yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.644
Chicken fight!

23:17.687 --> 23:19.606
(gasps)

23:24.861 --> 23:27.864
(people shouting)

23:35.038 --> 23:37.833
Enjoying yourself?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.001
Yeah, it's okay.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.212
FELICE:
Boy, when I was your age,

23:42.295 --> 23:46.550
{\an3}bathing suits were
a little more discreet.

23:46.633 --> 23:50.011
The least you could do is stop
standing here gawking at her.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.639
So you <i> don't</i> approve

23:52.722 --> 23:53.849
of what she's wearing?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.350
{\an1}Please.
Well, Mrs. Martin,

23:55.433 --> 23:57.644
I think you might
want to sit down.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.813
We actually agree on something.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.690
Well, I haven't had any luck

24:01.773 --> 24:04.192
in getting her
to tone down her wardrobe.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.070
Maybe it's time for you to try.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.825
(Donna squealing)

24:14.953 --> 24:16.997
(others cheering)

24:19.958 --> 24:21.626
Give me that.

24:25.797 --> 24:26.882
Hey, Donna,

24:26.965 --> 24:27.966
time to get out.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.555
What'd you say?

24:33.638 --> 24:34.514
Get out.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.731
{\an4}(groans)
Dude, I don't
want Robin.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.734
{\an5}She's tainted.
Steve, if I have to
hear one more word about

24:45.817 --> 24:48.403
the "Robin Conspiracy," it's
gonna force me to stop drinking.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.071
Oh, yeah? Well,
I don't see you

24:50.155 --> 24:52.407
{\an1}letting Valerie mount <i> you</i>
in the chicken fights,

24:52.490 --> 24:54.534
{\an1}okay, Mr. Rooster
Living in the Henhouse?

24:54.618 --> 24:56.411
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

24:56.494 --> 24:58.079
{\an4}BRANDON:
Ah, you see,
Valerie over there,

24:58.163 --> 25:00.373
{\an1}is supposed to be
like a sister to me,

25:00.457 --> 25:02.751
{\an3}but right now my
willpower's at about zero.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.921
{\an1}Well, either we give in
or we get out of the pool.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.047
I say we get out.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.049
You got any ideas
for any excuses?

25:09.132 --> 25:11.635
{\an3}Hey, guys, we've got
an emergency developing here.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.053
What's the problem?

25:13.136 --> 25:14.763
We're running
dangerously low on beer.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.223
There's an excuse!
Bingo!

25:16.306 --> 25:18.642
{\an5}We're gonna go
get some beer.
Yeah. Buh-bye.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.897
Sweetheart!

25:24.856 --> 25:26.316
(whispers):
Love you!

25:27.525 --> 25:29.236
{\an5}DYLAN:
What? You-you
never shot a close-up?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.321
You can't even tell
that that's me up there!

25:31.404 --> 25:32.822
CHARLEY:
Well, I'll tell you what.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.824
{\an3}When we get this movie
off the ground,

25:34.908 --> 25:36.826
{\an3}then I'll hire a professional
cinematographer.

25:36.910 --> 25:39.788
Yeah, well, at least
I got my butt up there, man.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.331
You-you didn't even try.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.792
{\an3}I make it a policy never
to get off the ground

25:43.875 --> 25:45.252
{\an3}unless there's a
stewardess on board.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.795
Well, with these
paraglider people on board,

25:46.878 --> 25:48.630
we're only about a million shy
of the budget, right?

25:48.713 --> 25:49.631
Don't worry.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.800
Uncle Charley's
got something major brewing.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.301
Mm, how major?

25:53.385 --> 25:54.636
Major enough to finance

25:54.719 --> 25:56.805
the whole picture
all by himself.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.057
Really?
Has he read the script?

25:59.140 --> 26:00.267
I faxed him a one-sheet.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.018
He wants us
to come out to his place

26:02.102 --> 26:03.186
in the desert and go over it.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.647
{\an3}If he likes it, we can be
in preproduction by summer.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.982
What's the catch?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.650
Why do you always think
that there's a catch?

26:08.733 --> 26:11.444
When there's this much money,
there is always a catch.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.529
Well, the only thing
that he said was

26:12.612 --> 26:14.781
that he wants us to make sure
that there's a part

26:14.864 --> 26:15.865
for his girlfriend in the movie.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.325
Girlfriend?

26:17.409 --> 26:18.994
He says she's really talented.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.996
(big sigh)

26:21.079 --> 26:24.874
Did you promise her a part,
or did you promise her the lead?

26:46.813 --> 26:48.189
Oh, wait a minute.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.190
What's the matter?

26:49.274 --> 26:52.652
{\an1}Did we just leave two
robo-babes in tiny bikinis

26:52.736 --> 26:55.697
{\an1}to come here and buy beer
with your fake I.D.?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.699
{\an3}(laughs):
Look, what can I say,

26:57.782 --> 26:59.326
{\an3}I'm just not
attracted to Robin.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.703
She's... she's got one
hell of a hard body--

27:01.786 --> 27:03.663
{\an3}all right, I'll give
that up-- but...

27:03.747 --> 27:05.874
I'm not tingling.

27:05.957 --> 27:09.169
Then you must be downing
Novocain spritzers, my friend.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.670
{\an3}(chuckles):
Oh, yeah? Well,

27:10.754 --> 27:11.838
what about you and Valerie, huh?

27:11.921 --> 27:13.715
{\an1}That's what I'm trying
to tell you, bro.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.716
{\an3}I'm kind of
reconsidering.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.843
{\an1}I wonder if
that's the Caddy

27:16.926 --> 27:19.220
I saw when
I first came to town.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.555
Ah, there she is--

27:20.638 --> 27:22.724
the goddess in the hat!

27:22.807 --> 27:24.726
{\an1}Don't look, don't look.
Walk with me.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.853
{\an3}Bro, I may turn into
a pillar of salt,

27:26.936 --> 27:30.231
and if I do, just use me for
margaritas-- I got to look.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.109
{\an3}I got to do it.
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.737
STEVE:
Ah! See? Now I <i> am</i> tingling.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.031
Forget it, Steve-- she's
way out of your league.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.741
{\an3}She's a goddess;
you're a mere mortal.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.743
STEVE:
She's... Ah! She... Ah!

27:41.826 --> 27:43.745
She's got to be a model.

27:43.828 --> 27:44.704
She's model quality.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.415
{\an3}Steve, I'm not real big
on models right now.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.583
Oh, yeah-- Kelly. Sorry.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.584
Yeah, Kelly.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.752
Let's talk about
goddesses, huh?

27:50.835 --> 27:51.753
Okay.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.671
A goddess here...

27:55.382 --> 27:57.801
{\an4}(bossa nova playing)
And for dessert,
Crème brûlée.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.470
Is there some sort of
hidden meaning here?

28:00.553 --> 28:01.763
What do you mean?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.932
{\an3}Crème brûlée means
"burnt cream."

28:04.015 --> 28:06.726
(laughs):
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.811
Does it bother you?

28:07.894 --> 28:11.231
No. Flambé I would have taken
as a personal affront.

28:11.314 --> 28:15.777
You know, you have to have the
best attitude of anybody I know.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.571
Well... I'm on my best behavior.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.657
{\an1}Good.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.744
{\an1}Hey, what's
going on in there?

28:24.828 --> 28:27.247
I don't know.
You tell me.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.083
{\an5}DAVID:
Wait a second,
is that Alison from the fire?

28:30.166 --> 28:31.584
CLARE:
Yep.

28:31.668 --> 28:36.297
{\an1}So Kelly turned down Dylan
and Brandon for Alison?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.842
{\an3}It can't be the way
it looks, right?

28:38.925 --> 28:42.095
{\an1}Ah, but why
the big secret?

28:42.178 --> 28:43.847
DAVID:
We better get going.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.140
CLARE:
No.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.808
They just saw us.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.851
(groans)

28:53.565 --> 28:56.651
I thought you guys were
supposed to be in Palm Springs.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.153
Nope. We're still here.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.988
We just got tied up

29:00.071 --> 29:02.949
doing some... errands
and stuff for my dad.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.666
Alison...

29:11.749 --> 29:13.501
Clare and David.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.502
Hi.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.670
{\an1}Hi.

29:15.753 --> 29:18.214
{\an1}Well, you two obviously...
want to...

29:18.298 --> 29:19.340
{\an1}be alone.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.467
I mean, you...

29:20.550 --> 29:22.469
{\an3}probably have lots
to talk about,

29:22.552 --> 29:24.012
so I'm just, uh...

29:24.095 --> 29:27.223
{\an3}gonna grab my suitcase,
and then we'll leave.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.561
♪ ♪

29:33.605 --> 29:35.190
{\an3}Hi. I'm-I'm David.
Yeah.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.901
I assumed you were David
and she was Clare.

29:37.984 --> 29:38.943
{\an1}DAVID (chuckles):
Yeah.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.820
{\an3}KELLY:
Want to stay

29:40.904 --> 29:42.697
for some food?
The more the merrier.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.324
Oh, no, we really

29:44.407 --> 29:46.409
got to keep moving, actually.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.369
{\an1}CLARE:
All set.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.579
Great.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.749
Well... bye.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.335
Nice to meet you again.

29:55.418 --> 29:58.254
Have a good... dinner.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.049
(door closes)

30:01.132 --> 30:03.927
{\an3}I want to humbly apologize
for my roommates.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.055
{\an3}They're usually a lot
more mature about things.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.517
{\an3}(chuckles):
Although...

30:10.600 --> 30:14.062
seeing this, I can see how
they'd get the wrong idea.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.356
Well, blame it on me.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.107
I set the table.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.862
Alison...

30:22.946 --> 30:26.741
I know you have...
these feelings for me.

30:26.824 --> 30:28.785
{\an3}I mean, it's
totally natural

30:28.868 --> 30:30.745
{\an3}after all that we've been
through together to...

30:30.828 --> 30:32.747
think about each other.

30:32.830 --> 30:34.249
A lot, even.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.876
I mean, it'd be weird
if we didn't.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.419
I know.

30:38.503 --> 30:42.006
That's what I've been
telling myself, too.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.760
But... after spending
all day together,

30:45.843 --> 30:49.055
I know now that
there's more to it than that.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.932
Alison...

30:51.015 --> 30:53.309
I really love you, Kelly.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.811
I do.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.787
{\an1}Well, I hope you're
glad you stayed, Ray.

31:12.870 --> 31:15.290
Yes, I am.
Thank you, Mrs. Martin.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.292
{\an1}Oh, and, if you're
responsible

31:17.375 --> 31:20.336
{\an1}for what Donna's
wearing, thank you.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.097
Face it, guys.
Sonny Bono's blowing you off.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.141
He and Cher are rehearsing
for their comeback.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.142
(chuckles)

31:34.225 --> 31:36.185
{\an3}Brandon, for
your information,

31:36.269 --> 31:37.145
Mr. Bono is now speaking

31:37.228 --> 31:38.813
{\an3}to the National
Republican Women's Caucus,

31:38.896 --> 31:40.189
{\an3}and shall be here
momentarily.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.941
{\an1}I don't think
he even went to college.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.152
{\an3}Would you knock
it off, please, hmm?

31:44.235 --> 31:46.154
{\an1}Well, then, what
college did he go to?

31:46.237 --> 31:48.197
{\an4}STEVE:
Look, cool it,
man, okay?

31:48.281 --> 31:49.407
This is a big
deal for us.

31:49.490 --> 31:51.451
{\an3}The guy's
a U.S. senator.

31:51.534 --> 31:55.163
He's a congressman, Steve.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.290
Congressman.
He has no sense of punctuality,

31:57.373 --> 31:58.541
and he never could carry

31:58.625 --> 32:01.210
{\an5}a tune. Remember?
Would you get him
out of here, please?

32:03.379 --> 32:05.465
Wait. Don't you touch that! No!

32:05.548 --> 32:07.175
Got your cake.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.636
{\an1}Thanks for being
in my corner, man.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.348
How many times have
I covered for you before?

32:13.431 --> 32:15.016
{\an1}Hey, look. You're dangerous
tonight, all right?

32:15.099 --> 32:16.809
{\an1}I want you to go put
yourself right to bed.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.353
Wait, wait, wait. Let me go
back in there and apologize.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.688
{\an1}I think that would just
make things worse, Brandon.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.399
{\an3}Okay, fine.
I understand.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.526
Go on back to your
little big deal there.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.028
Hey, and no more
drinking tonight.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.030
Okay? Tomorrow's another day.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.324
Bro, I'm not even drunk.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.241
(clattering)

32:32.325 --> 32:35.411
See? I'm fine. Fine.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.042
Well, good evening,
bathing beauty.

32:41.125 --> 32:45.088
Hey, stranger.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.714
Where you been?

32:46.798 --> 32:49.050
Trying to find my way back here.
This place is immense!

32:49.133 --> 32:51.678
Well, come on in.
There's a lot of room.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.223
{\an3}Go get your
bathing suit on!

32:55.306 --> 32:56.391
All right. Okay.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.643
Don't you go anywhere.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.829
(knocking on door)

33:18.746 --> 33:19.622
How's it going?

33:19.706 --> 33:21.207
{\an3}Come on in.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.084
Ta-da!

33:23.167 --> 33:25.294
{\an3}It's not exactly
traffic-stopping, I know.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.255
No. It's beautiful.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.882
It was really nice of you
to take me shopping today.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.260
For the past six months,
my only fashion choices

33:32.343 --> 33:34.929
{\an3}have been the color
of the pressure bandage.

33:35.012 --> 33:38.349
{\an3}Could you, uh...
help me snap this?

33:38.433 --> 33:38.933
{\an1}Sure.

33:39.016 --> 33:40.935
(whispers):
Thanks.

33:42.145 --> 33:45.982
{\an3}So, um... can
I ask you something?

33:46.065 --> 33:49.652
{\an1}Looking for
fashion advice?

33:49.736 --> 33:50.903
{\an3}Afraid not.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.113
I didn't think so.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.115
{\an1}Why didn't you
tell your roommates

33:54.198 --> 33:57.702
{\an1}I was going
to be here today?

33:57.785 --> 33:59.912
I don't know.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.957
I just didn't feel
like discussing everything

34:03.040 --> 34:03.958
to death.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.918
{\an1}I wanted us
to have a nice day

34:06.002 --> 34:07.462
{\an1}before you
headed up north.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.132
{\an3}I don't absolutely
have to go.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.137
{\an1}You know,
it's so strange

34:16.219 --> 34:19.306
because I know
that you're looking

34:19.389 --> 34:21.809
at the two of us standing here,

34:21.893 --> 34:25.021
and you see a couple.

34:25.103 --> 34:30.818
But that's... just so far
from the way I feel.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.780
You know, Kelly,

34:33.862 --> 34:36.324
it's definitely
one of those things

34:36.407 --> 34:40.495
that you'll never know
until you try.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.335
I guess what I'm saying
is that I know.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.045
I'm sorry.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.970
I think I should
probably get some sleep.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.555
My legs are starting to hurt,

34:59.639 --> 35:01.432
and I can't be responsible
for what I say

35:01.516 --> 35:04.018
once those painkillers kick in.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.815
I'm going to miss you.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.191
Have fun in Palm Springs.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.860
I'll miss you, too.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.889
CINDY:
Have you lost your mind?

35:45.518 --> 35:51.065
{\an3}Brandon, you said you
wouldn't fall apart on us.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.734
What are you guys doing here?

35:53.818 --> 35:56.863
Well, you better
ask yourself that.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.573
This is <i> your</i> delusion.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.825
{\an3}Yeah. And since when
did you start drinking?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.535
Hang on a second, Dad.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.078
I've earned this bender.

36:04.161 --> 36:06.205
I was a good Boy Scout
for a long time.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.748
Where did it get me, huh?

36:07.832 --> 36:08.749
{\an1}CINDY:
So, every time

36:08.833 --> 36:09.959
you don't get your way,

36:10.042 --> 36:11.544
you're going
to get self-destructive?

36:11.627 --> 36:14.922
Mom, I'm just
having a little bit

36:15.006 --> 36:16.966
of good old-fashioned fun,
like everybody else.

36:17.049 --> 36:17.884
No, you're not.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.802
You're joining Valerie
in that hot tub

36:19.886 --> 36:21.637
with impure thoughts.

36:21.721 --> 36:25.099
{\an4}JIM:
Well, she has practically
thrown herself at him.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.934
It's a wonder he's
held out this long.

36:27.018 --> 36:27.935
Stifle it, Jim!

36:28.019 --> 36:29.770
She's like family.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.106
You understand that,
don't you, Brandon?

36:32.190 --> 36:35.401
Yeah, I do. Okay?

36:35.484 --> 36:37.153
I do.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.572
{\an1}VALERIE: Who you
talking to?

36:42.199 --> 36:43.993
{\an3}Uh...

36:45.870 --> 36:47.413
Nobody.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.956
Why?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.459
I was worried about you.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.419
You were taking so long.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.963
Let's get you into that hot tub.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.969
{\an1}200 people exactly
like your mom.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.180
I didn't think I was going
to get out of there alive.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.640
{\an3}Oh, come on.
You and my mom

37:05.723 --> 37:07.016
{\an3}looked like
old pals tonight.

37:07.099 --> 37:07.850
{\an1}Believe me.
The only thing

37:07.934 --> 37:09.310
that kept me going
was the thought

37:09.393 --> 37:11.187
of us going
horseback riding tomorrow.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.773
Yeah? What about tonight?

37:13.856 --> 37:16.067
{\an3}Why don't you come
to my room for a while?

37:19.028 --> 37:20.821
Well, we could do that.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.448
{\an1}But, with your mother
in the next room,

37:22.531 --> 37:23.324
{\an1}it could get
a little dicey.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.159
Besides, if I don't
get back to Steve's

37:25.242 --> 37:26.786
before all the
beds are taken,

37:26.869 --> 37:27.787
{\an1}then I'm
probably going

37:27.870 --> 37:29.163
{\an1}to be sleeping
in my truck.

37:29.246 --> 37:30.706
Well, looks like Steve

37:30.790 --> 37:33.876
might be sleeping
elsewhere tonight.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.506
Lucky him.

37:38.589 --> 37:39.548
Good night.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.675
Night.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.222
{\an1}I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

37:46.305 --> 37:51.185
I just don't like when
my father tries to fix me up.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.229
It's the same with me.

37:53.312 --> 37:57.483
You know, I thought you had
to be another geeky loser.

37:57.566 --> 38:00.528
Until I saw you on
the tennis court, that is.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.531
You made quite an impression
on me, too.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.825
Maybe we should
just think about us,

38:05.908 --> 38:07.201
and let our fathers concentrate

38:07.284 --> 38:10.204
{\an3}on that business deal
they're putting together.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.248
Business deal?

38:15.334 --> 38:17.253
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:17.336 --> 38:18.587
{\an3}Oh, come on!
Stop being a wuss.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.256
It's not that hot
when you get in.

38:20.339 --> 38:22.049
Ah, ah, okay, that's better.

38:22.133 --> 38:22.883
Oh, yeah, that's better.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.220
So, uh... you want
to smoke a little?

38:26.303 --> 38:27.930
No, thanks.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.890
I think I've had enough
hallucinations for one night.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.642
I'm just going
to kind of relax a little

38:31.726 --> 38:33.102
right over here.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.895
Well, don't be over there
too long.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.313
People are going
to start coming back.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.274
What people?

38:38.357 --> 38:40.401
{\an3}CROWD: ♪ Keep that hot
tub humming ♪

MAN:
Can I help you?

39:17.313 --> 39:22.318
Yeah. Hi. Charley Rawlins,
Dylan McKay to see Mr. Rose.

39:22.401 --> 39:25.654
We're here about the movie
project--<i> On Borrowed Time.</i>

39:25.738 --> 39:28.282
Okay.

39:28.365 --> 39:29.825
You must have said

39:29.909 --> 39:31.410
the magic word.

39:31.494 --> 39:34.163
Open, Sesame!

39:38.334 --> 39:40.461
{\an5}CHARLEY:
Not a bad little piece
of property, eh?

39:40.544 --> 39:44.048
{\an5}DYLAN:
Who lives here,
the Sultan of Brunei?

39:44.131 --> 39:45.382
CHARLEY:
Hey, stick with me, man,

39:45.466 --> 39:49.804
and the world
will be your oyster.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.806
Great! Rollins and McKay.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.474
Come on in, boys.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.476
{\an3}I'm glad you could do this
on such short notice.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.477
I'm Tom.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.104
{\an1}Charley.
This is Dylan.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.605
How you doing?
Welcome.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.107
{\an3}You know, I
always like to say

40:01.190 --> 40:02.817
that we're on
"desert time" out here.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.068
{\an1}So, if things seem
a little too relaxed,

40:04.151 --> 40:05.653
that's because they are.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.738
No problem with me.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.365
{\an1}We'll work,
we'll eat, and you'll

40:09.448 --> 40:10.991
stay the night. Hmm?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.159
Building up relationships,
to me,

40:12.243 --> 40:13.160
is just like building equity.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.995
I couldn't agree
with you more.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.872
Good. Lou will show
you to your rooms,

40:16.956 --> 40:18.666
{\an1}you can get
refreshed, and then

40:18.749 --> 40:19.583
we'll get down to it.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.876
You know, Angela
is really looking forward

40:20.960 --> 40:25.506
to a read-through of the script.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.007
Where is Angela?

40:27.091 --> 40:28.342
{\an1}Oh, she's...
she's working out

40:28.425 --> 40:29.844
on the patio.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.595
{\an3}CHARLEY:
Oh. Well, she

40:31.679 --> 40:33.180
certainly has a
lot of presence.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.181
{\an1}Thanks.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.475
{\an1}Lou, uh, take their bags to
their rooms, will you?

40:36.559 --> 40:38.060
Yes, sir, Mr. Rose.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.020
{\an1}Oh, guys,
hold on a second.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.314
{\an1}I'll pull Angela
from that StairMaster.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.694
So, uh... what
business is Tom in

40:46.777 --> 40:48.154
that he needs the bodyguard?

40:48.237 --> 40:50.823
CHARLEY:
He's in, um...

40:50.906 --> 40:51.824
vending machines.

40:51.907 --> 40:53.534
{\an3}Oh, he's in
vending machines.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.870
{\an3}Why don't you just say he was
an olive oil importer?

40:55.953 --> 40:57.163
{\an3}You mean the
guy's connected?

40:57.246 --> 41:00.207
Dylan, the guy
is a serious movie investor.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.125
{\an1}He's very
knowledgeable.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.168
Doesn't answer

41:02.251 --> 41:03.169
my question.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.171
Would you just be cool about it?

41:05.254 --> 41:06.714
He's staked lots of films.

41:06.797 --> 41:07.715
This is a no-brainer.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.508
Yeah. So are you.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.260
Yeah.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.559
(horse whinnying)

41:27.693 --> 41:30.070
This is more like it.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.073
Can you believe how much it's
changed in the last ten years?

41:33.157 --> 41:36.452
{\an1}I don't really know
what it was like then.

41:36.535 --> 41:37.578
Totally different.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.746
See all these houses

41:38.829 --> 41:41.624
{\an1}with the uh, red roofs
and swimming pools?

41:41.707 --> 41:43.876
It was just desert before,

41:43.959 --> 41:45.794
{\an3}a few roadrunners and lots
and lots of snakes.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.421
Calm down there...
It's all right.

41:47.504 --> 41:51.133
{\an3}You just have
his reins too tight

41:51.217 --> 41:53.052
after a long gallop
like that.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.973
Thanks.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.808
{\an1}I guess I'm a little
out of practice.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.101
You want some

42:01.185 --> 42:02.770
juice or water?

42:02.853 --> 42:03.854
No. I'm fine.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.814
Actually, we uh, we should
be heading back soon.

42:05.898 --> 42:09.276
Wait a second,
we just got going.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.278
We've been out almost
an hour, Ray.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.905
Wait a second.

42:12.988 --> 42:15.074
I drove you all the way
to Palm Springs.

42:15.157 --> 42:16.784
I'm as nice as possible
to your mother.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.119
{\an3}I'm living with
Steve Sanders

42:19.203 --> 42:21.580
and the Village of Drunken
Idiots because you asked me to.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.416
And now I can't get more than
an hour of your precious time?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.293
You know my mother's moderating
a panel this morning.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.086
You know I can't miss it.

42:27.169 --> 42:30.631
Oh, sure, but you
can blow me off.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.174
Thanks a lot.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.300
Ray, you're not being fair.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.635
{\an3}No, I'm being
more than fair.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.345
You had all the time in
the world yesterday

42:36.428 --> 42:37.805
to prance around half naked

42:37.888 --> 42:39.473
{\an3}in front of these
jerks from KEG House.

42:39.556 --> 42:40.266
I what?

42:40.349 --> 42:42.601
{\an1}I bought that
bathing suit for you.

42:42.685 --> 42:45.187
I mean, you can ask Kelly,
she was right there with me.

42:45.271 --> 42:47.022
In fact every time I buy
anything it's always,

42:47.106 --> 42:48.023
"Will Ray like this?"

42:48.107 --> 42:50.526
Sure. Should we go now?

42:50.609 --> 42:54.029
Look, if you want me
to dress differently,

42:54.113 --> 42:55.656
just tell me and I will.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.199
But I can't

42:57.283 --> 42:59.243
miss my mother's panel,
you know that.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.954
What I know is, if you loved me,

43:02.037 --> 43:04.164
I'd be higher on your list
of priorities.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.499
{\an3}Ray...
And you wouldn't

43:05.582 --> 43:08.419
need all
those guys leering at you.

43:08.502 --> 43:09.503
You wouldn't want it.

43:09.586 --> 43:10.754
I don't want it!

43:22.766 --> 43:24.852
Brando, I got ice packs,

43:24.935 --> 43:26.020
I got vitamin B,
I got crackers.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.521
What do you want?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.064
I just want to die.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.357
The aspirin didn't work, huh?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.900
Not on this hangover.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.194
Let me see what I
got that's stronger.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.571
Just don't let me drink today.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.364
(chuckles)

43:37.448 --> 43:38.157
Hey, David, Clare.

43:38.240 --> 43:38.699
Hey.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.825
What's going on, man?

43:39.908 --> 43:42.703
What's up, man?

43:42.786 --> 43:43.495
Brandon, nice trunks.

43:43.579 --> 43:44.538
{\an3}Hi, kids.

43:44.621 --> 43:46.332
Welcome to hell.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.167
Muntz is the devil,
steer clear.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.377
I didn't expect
to see you here.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.046
You're not seeing me.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.672
I'm somebody else.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.341
I better go look
for Alphaville,

43:55.424 --> 43:56.508
{\an1}tell Donna we're
here, okay?

43:56.592 --> 43:58.260
Hey, did Kelly come up
with you guys?

43:58.344 --> 43:59.636
Hmm?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.722
Nope. No, I haven't seen her.

44:01.805 --> 44:01.847
Bye.

44:05.309 --> 44:05.934
Dave?

44:06.018 --> 44:07.811
Yes, sir?

44:07.895 --> 44:09.021
What was that about?

44:09.104 --> 44:10.856
Uh, nothing.

44:10.939 --> 44:12.441
{\an3}Dave?

44:12.524 --> 44:13.901
Donna already told me

44:13.984 --> 44:16.904
that Kelly's got something
going on back home.

44:16.987 --> 44:20.199
Is she seeing Dylan?

44:20.199 --> 44:23.744
No. It isn't Dylan.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.288
But she is seeing someone?

44:26.372 --> 44:28.415
Look, Brandon, you really
shouldn't jump

44:28.499 --> 44:29.625
to conclusions or anything.

44:29.708 --> 44:31.877
Dave, don't make me
get out

44:31.960 --> 44:32.920
of this pool.

44:33.003 --> 44:35.255
Okay, okay.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.008
(sighs)

44:38.092 --> 44:42.388
Well, we uh, walked in on
Kelly last night with...

44:42.471 --> 44:42.513
Alison.

44:47.684 --> 44:47.726
With Alison?

44:50.813 --> 44:52.064
Alison, Alison?

44:52.147 --> 44:52.189
Yeah, Alison, Alison.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.445
I think I have the ticket.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.781
Tabasco.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.574
Forget the Tabasco.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.868
How about a beer?

45:04.952 --> 45:05.953
Oh, boy.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.795
FELICE:
<i>Well, they call us elitists,</i>

45:14.878 --> 45:17.464
{\an1}and, uh, they're not
entirely wrong...

45:17.548 --> 45:18.298
(group chuckling)

45:18.382 --> 45:20.134
But from what
I've heard here today,

45:20.217 --> 45:22.302
we can all feel very,
very good about ourselves.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.972
Because now, as this
whole country tries to return

45:25.055 --> 45:28.434
to basic moral values--
friendship,

45:28.517 --> 45:30.436
honesty, loyalty,

45:30.519 --> 45:33.814
family-- we can all truly say

45:33.897 --> 45:36.650
{\an3}those have been our
values all along.

45:36.733 --> 45:40.028
And to all the
Johnny-come-latelies,

45:40.112 --> 45:42.322
better late than never.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.116
Thank you all very much.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.999
Do you think that "better
late than never" was for me?

45:52.082 --> 45:52.833
You better hope so.

45:52.916 --> 45:53.750
Your mom was really hurt

45:53.834 --> 45:55.669
when you two lovebirds
didn't show up.

45:55.752 --> 45:57.838
Oh, boy.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.798
Mom!

45:59.882 --> 46:01.633
I am sorry.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.177
This was supposed to
be our time together.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.304
Uh, Mrs. Martin,
it was my fault.

46:05.387 --> 46:06.722
I thought I knew the trail,

46:06.805 --> 46:08.640
and we took a wrong
turn and got lost.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.017
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Ray.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.101
It's gentlemanly.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.353
But it doesn't make me look any
less a perfect fool

46:13.437 --> 46:15.022
{\an1}talking about
family and decency

46:15.105 --> 46:17.900
when my own daughter doesn't
have the courtesy to show up.

46:19.776 --> 46:22.696
{\an3}I guess we should have showed
up a little earlier.

46:22.779 --> 46:24.531
{\an6}She'll get over it.
DONNA:
You think?

46:24.615 --> 46:27.201
I'm still hearing about stuff
I did wrong in the first grade.

46:27.284 --> 46:28.243
I'll give you a quick briefing

46:28.327 --> 46:29.995
and you can talk to her
about it at the luncheon.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.956
{\an3}I think I'll sit
that one out.

46:33.040 --> 46:33.999
Fine.

46:34.082 --> 46:34.958
Then go back to Steve's.

46:35.042 --> 46:37.878
{\an3}No, believe me,
I'm not going back there.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.421
{\an3}I'm done with Steve
and Brandon

46:39.505 --> 46:40.923
{\an3}and that whole
lame ass KEG crowd.

46:41.006 --> 46:44.009
Wait, Brandon's here?

46:44.092 --> 46:45.219
{\an4}STEVE:
Okay, hold it down.
It's ringing.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.678
Okay, this is the game,

46:46.762 --> 46:49.264
{\an5}match, set,
whatever it is...
(all laughing)

46:49.348 --> 46:50.724
Hold on, it's ringing!
Take it, take it!

46:50.807 --> 46:53.101
{\an5}OPERATOR: Doctor's office.
(Southern accent):
Uh, hi, there, is this

46:53.185 --> 46:55.062
Dr. Holden's office?

46:55.145 --> 46:58.065
Yeah, uh, my name is, uh,
Richard Zinya,

46:58.148 --> 47:02.903
{\an3}and I'm a very
well-endowed man,

47:02.986 --> 47:04.905
{\an3}and I was wondering if
you do some sort of a uh,

47:04.988 --> 47:07.449
a reduction surgery over there?

47:07.533 --> 47:10.077
Would you find that out
for me, please?

47:11.995 --> 47:13.622
Dude, 45 seconds

47:13.705 --> 47:15.207
you had them
on the line!

47:15.290 --> 47:16.250
Nice!
You the man.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.251
{\an3}Thank you,
thank you.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.627
Party on.

47:18.710 --> 47:20.587
What's the matter, Kelly,
you don't approve?

47:20.671 --> 47:21.755
Don't let me stop you.

47:21.838 --> 47:24.091
{\an6}It's all a little lame,
but have your fun.
Wait, Kel.

47:24.174 --> 47:26.260
Come on back,
hang out with us guys.

47:26.343 --> 47:29.763
Oh, that's right,
you don't like guys anymore.

47:29.846 --> 47:30.764
{\an1}STEVE:
D'oh!

47:30.847 --> 47:34.434
(laughter)

47:34.518 --> 47:36.061
Brandon, can you come
downstairs, please?

47:36.144 --> 47:38.063
Absolutely.

47:38.146 --> 47:39.940
(German accent):
But hurry back.

47:40.023 --> 47:42.067
Ivana Tinkel

47:42.150 --> 47:46.029
{\an3}will be calling the
urology department next.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.245
What was that crack about?

47:53.328 --> 47:54.621
I don't know,
you tell me.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.164
Did you really leave
me for a girl?

47:56.248 --> 47:58.584
Who told you that?
David or Clare?

47:58.667 --> 48:00.836
See, I don't see you denying it.

48:00.919 --> 48:02.629
So, women turn you on, huh?

48:02.713 --> 48:03.797
They always work for me.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.341
Alison is just my friend.
Do you have a problem with that?

48:07.926 --> 48:10.304
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry,
this will only take a second.

48:10.387 --> 48:13.015
Uh, Brandon, I got that room if
you need a place to crash.

48:13.098 --> 48:14.641
{\an3}Thanks.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.685
Don't get the wrong
idea, Kelly.

48:16.768 --> 48:18.145
It's a two-bedroom suite.

48:18.228 --> 48:19.229
You know what,

48:19.313 --> 48:21.565
{\an1}I don't care what Brandon
does with his life anymore.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.442
Obviously you don't either.

48:23.525 --> 48:24.651
He's all yours.

48:30.532 --> 48:33.827
Well, I guess she told me.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.506
Eat that!

48:46.590 --> 48:48.175
Florida wins!

48:48.258 --> 48:49.468
{\an1}Excuse me.
What?

48:49.551 --> 48:50.510
{\an1}Excuse me.
What?!

48:50.594 --> 48:52.012
{\an1}What did you do
to that girl?

48:52.095 --> 48:53.055
Nothing.

48:53.138 --> 48:54.348
{\an3}Which is why
she's so pissed.

48:54.431 --> 48:56.016
You trying to make
her life miserable?

48:56.099 --> 48:57.184
{\an1}Or mine?

48:57.267 --> 48:58.226
You know what?

48:58.310 --> 48:59.186
I don't like you using me

48:59.269 --> 49:00.771
{\an3}as a stud animal for
your networking, okay?

49:00.854 --> 49:02.564
What're you talking about?

49:02.648 --> 49:03.649
Don't deny it.

49:03.732 --> 49:04.858
{\an3}You want me to go
out with Robin

49:04.942 --> 49:06.902
just so you can close some
business deal with Buddy, right?

49:06.985 --> 49:08.820
You got bubbles
in your think tank?

49:08.904 --> 49:10.447
{\an1}The deal with Buddy is
for a nonprofit charity.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.491
I don't care whether I do it,
one way or the other.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.034
{\an3}Then why are you pressing me
to go out with her?

49:14.117 --> 49:15.994
Because I wanted you to meet

49:16.078 --> 49:17.621
a real dreamboat
for once in your sorry life.

49:17.704 --> 49:20.415
{\an1}What a knucklehead
you are.

49:20.499 --> 49:23.418
{\an3}All right. It's always
my fault, huh?

49:25.128 --> 49:26.546
(sighs)

49:33.095 --> 49:35.222
WOMAN:
<i>"Picture yourself going</i>

49:35.305 --> 49:37.015
"down...

49:37.099 --> 49:39.434
"a long, golden

49:39.518 --> 49:41.061
{\an1}"staircase.
Listen

49:41.144 --> 49:43.146
"to the sound of my voice.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.440
"Let it take you deeper

49:45.524 --> 49:48.026
and deeper."

49:48.110 --> 49:50.570
Doctor, I can feel
it again.

49:50.654 --> 49:52.572
"Hold the image

49:52.656 --> 49:55.409
{\an3}"and breathe through it.
Let it take you

49:55.492 --> 49:59.037
wherever it's going to go."

49:59.121 --> 50:01.039
{\an4}CHARLEY:
"Carl's eyes widen
with sudden alarm.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.916
His hypnotherapist
leans in and whispers..."

50:03.000 --> 50:04.418
"What are you seeing?"

50:04.501 --> 50:06.086
{\an4}CHARLEY:
"Cut to Carl's office
at the bank.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.629
{\an1}"Night.
Bill Masters and

50:07.713 --> 50:09.464
Sgt. Dray
flip on Carl's computer."

50:09.548 --> 50:11.800
"We've got to work fast."

50:11.883 --> 50:14.594
{\an1}Charley, let's, let's
put a pin in this, huh?

50:14.678 --> 50:16.430
What, is something wrong?

50:16.513 --> 50:18.306
{\an1}No, not really.
We just need a break.

50:18.390 --> 50:19.433
Thank you.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.601
I have to go to the potty.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.107
{\an4}CHARLEY:
You know, uh, speaking
as a director...

50:27.190 --> 50:29.151
she's got a lot of potential.

50:29.234 --> 50:31.528
She's not your problem.
Your problem is story.

50:31.611 --> 50:33.238
{\an1}How's that?
Look...

50:33.321 --> 50:36.074
I know a fair amount
about how banks work,

50:36.158 --> 50:37.409
and I don't believe Carl's scam.

50:37.492 --> 50:38.618
{\an1}Now, if I don't
believe it,

50:38.702 --> 50:40.162
{\an1}how's your average Joe
going to relate?

50:40.245 --> 50:41.038
Well, I disagree with you.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.123
I've done a lot
of research on that.

50:43.206 --> 50:44.332
{\an1}ROSE:
Sorry, no financier

50:44.416 --> 50:46.793
could pull it off.
You'd see it coming.

50:46.877 --> 50:47.961
It works.

50:48.044 --> 50:49.171
{\an3}I know.

50:49.254 --> 50:50.589
{\an3}CHARLEY:
I think that

50:50.672 --> 50:52.799
Dylan's father created this.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.092
{\an3}DYLAN:
Yeah, he did.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.469
Made himself a fortune.

50:55.552 --> 50:58.764
I'd like to meet your father.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.390
Yeah, well, good luck,
he's dead.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.145
Was your father Jack McKay?

51:05.228 --> 51:08.190
Yeah. Why? You know him?

51:08.273 --> 51:09.149
Not really.

51:09.232 --> 51:12.319
But, uh... if you're telling me
Jack McKay

51:12.402 --> 51:14.321
pulled off this scam, I buy it.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.114
Let's get back
to the script.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.366
{\an1}Angela!

51:19.409 --> 51:20.410
{\an1}Angela!

51:24.372 --> 51:26.333
{\an1}Steve! How was
your tennis match?

51:26.416 --> 51:28.126
It was a disaster.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.544
What are you doing
in Valerie's car?

51:29.628 --> 51:31.129
Ah, looks like I'm gonna
move my toothbrush

51:31.213 --> 51:33.340
out of KEG central
and move into her suite.

51:33.423 --> 51:34.508
Wow...

51:34.591 --> 51:35.717
What about Kelly?

51:35.801 --> 51:37.844
Disastrous.
Want to go into town?

51:37.928 --> 51:39.137
Any place is better than here.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.723
{\an1}(groans) So, I told
Valerie I'd gas up her car

51:41.807 --> 51:44.017
and get some necessities
at the drug store.

51:45.393 --> 51:47.521
I can't believe you're gonna
do the nasty with Valerie.

51:47.604 --> 51:50.190
Well, neither can I,
but at this point in time

51:50.273 --> 51:52.192
it doesn't look like
there's any turning back.

51:54.277 --> 51:55.362
(tires squealing)

52:00.617 --> 52:02.202
{\an3}RAY: What is this?
You're still mad

52:02.285 --> 52:03.495
{\an3}about missing this
thing with your mother?

52:03.578 --> 52:05.247
{\an4}DONNA:
Could we
just let it drop?

52:05.330 --> 52:06.039
{\an1}I need a
break, okay?

52:06.122 --> 52:07.707
{\an3}What? You need a
break from <i> me?</i>

52:07.791 --> 52:09.543
{\an1}No, I want to get
out of these clothes.

52:09.626 --> 52:11.378
{\an3}Good, 'cause the only
reason I'm here is you,

52:11.461 --> 52:14.256
but maybe I should go back to
L.A. and rehearse with my band,

52:14.339 --> 52:16.258
which is what I shoulda been
doing this whole time anyway.

52:16.341 --> 52:17.551
Yeah. Maybe you should.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.929
Hey, don't walk away from me.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.055
Stop it!

52:23.598 --> 52:25.350
{\an3}Stop acting like
I'm not even here.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.227
{\an1}You know what?
I can't deal with this.

52:27.310 --> 52:29.271
Why are you so mad at me?!

52:29.354 --> 52:30.230
Because you <i> make</i> me mad.

52:30.313 --> 52:31.898
{\an1}You know what? I have to
go work on my speech.

52:31.982 --> 52:33.358
No!

52:33.441 --> 52:34.901
Ow! You're hurting me!

52:34.985 --> 52:36.236
You're gonna
listen to me.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.404
(shrieks)

52:37.487 --> 52:38.905
Donna!

52:38.989 --> 52:40.115
{\an3}Donna.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.244
{\an1}Ow... (sobs)
Donna.

52:44.327 --> 52:45.745
{\an1}I didn't mean to, babe.
(crying)

52:45.829 --> 52:48.081
Stay away from me.

52:48.164 --> 52:49.291
{\an1}VALERIE:
Donna?

52:49.374 --> 52:51.251
Are you okay?

52:51.334 --> 52:52.294
No.

52:52.377 --> 52:53.587
Ray, go get the hotel doctor.

52:53.670 --> 52:54.588
{\an3}Go!
I'll stay here.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.881
You go get the doctor.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.258
It was an accident, babe.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.384
I didn't mean to.

52:59.467 --> 53:01.636
{\an3}You know that,
don't you?

53:18.570 --> 53:20.322
{\an3}All right, man, will
you get the gas?

53:20.405 --> 53:21.531
I want to check the oil.

53:21.615 --> 53:25.952
I can't believe
how I blew it.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.954
{\an1}Robin must think
I'm an idiot.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.956
{\an3}So, apologize
for being an idiot.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.499
You need a little help?

53:34.085 --> 53:35.086
Oh, wow.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.048
{\an1}The goddess
in the Caddy.

53:38.131 --> 53:39.633
Hmmm.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.768
Hi, can I do that
to you... for you?

53:49.851 --> 53:52.687
Darling, you read my mind.
My nail polish is still drying.

53:52.771 --> 53:53.730
{\an1}Oh.

53:53.813 --> 53:55.482
High-test, I assume?

53:55.565 --> 53:58.526
Absolutely. Thanks.

53:58.610 --> 53:59.736
Oh, I'm, I'm Elle.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.947
I'm Steve.

54:02.030 --> 54:03.490
Wet nails.

54:03.573 --> 54:05.533
This is, uh...

54:05.617 --> 54:07.702
Brandon. I thought
he was helping <i> me.</i>

54:07.786 --> 54:08.745
{\an1}Ha-ha-ha.

54:08.828 --> 54:10.080
{\an3}Ha-ha-ha.

54:10.163 --> 54:11.873
Well, I take it you guys
aren't from the Springs?

54:11.957 --> 54:13.875
No, no. We're just here
for a little R&amp;R.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.168
It's a great town, though.

54:15.251 --> 54:16.169
Are you from here?

54:16.252 --> 54:17.379
Absolutely.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.339
A born and bred desert rose.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.550
So, are you going
to just stand there

54:22.634 --> 54:23.969
with that hose in your hand?

54:26.054 --> 54:27.973
Or are you going
to stick it in my tank?

54:28.056 --> 54:29.683
Pshaw.

54:36.982 --> 54:38.191
Ray. How is she?

54:38.274 --> 54:40.068
{\an1}Don't know yet.
Well, I went

54:40.151 --> 54:42.028
to her hotel room. They said an
ambulance came. What happened?

54:42.112 --> 54:45.323
Well, we were, uh, heading up
the stairs towards her suite,

54:45.407 --> 54:47.492
{\an3}and she... tripped
or something,

54:47.575 --> 54:50.078
and, uh, next thing I knew, she
was down at the bottom, holding

54:50.161 --> 54:51.955
{\an6}her arm like
it was broken.
Her arm?

54:52.038 --> 54:55.709
Thank God. I thought she'd
broken her neck or something.

54:55.792 --> 54:57.002
No, we got lucky.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.879
Yeah. Hey!

54:59.963 --> 55:01.047
How are you feeling?

55:01.131 --> 55:02.340
Are you okay, babe?

55:02.424 --> 55:04.926
I've been climbing
the walls out here.

55:05.010 --> 55:06.928
It's true. He has.
You have one very worried

55:07.012 --> 55:08.888
guy on your hands.

55:10.181 --> 55:11.057
Well, say something, honey.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.559
They're gonna think you
have a concussion.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.728
It's just a sprain.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.021
Well, that's great.

55:16.104 --> 55:17.230
{\an1}I'm gonna

55:17.313 --> 55:18.648
call Valerie.
I'll be right back.

55:19.649 --> 55:20.567
Valerie?

55:20.650 --> 55:22.736
Yeah. She was a big help.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.029
Valerie was a big help?

55:24.112 --> 55:25.530
Are you sure she
didn't push you?

55:25.613 --> 55:28.074
{\an1}Look, I know you're
no ballerina,

55:28.158 --> 55:29.492
but what happened?

55:30.493 --> 55:32.078
{\an1}Did you tell her
what happened?

55:32.162 --> 55:33.913
{\an4}KELLY:
Yeah, he said
you came,

55:33.997 --> 55:36.124
you saw, you fell.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.918
Yeah. (giggles)

55:39.002 --> 55:40.837
It was pretty embarrassing.

55:47.677 --> 55:50.764
(soft music playing)

55:50.847 --> 55:52.932
{\an1}After all, you did abandon
Valerie to come here.

55:53.016 --> 55:55.602
I called her, told her
I was gonna be late.

55:55.685 --> 55:56.770
She was very understanding.

55:56.853 --> 55:58.563
Perhaps you're
having second thoughts

55:58.646 --> 55:59.981
about bunking down with her.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.566
I'm onto third
thoughts already, Dad,

56:01.649 --> 56:03.151
but we're young,
we're able-bodied.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.444
We'll be careful.
It'll be ecstasy.

56:04.527 --> 56:06.237
What's the big deal?

56:06.321 --> 56:07.781
Valerie looks up to you.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.616
{\an3}You shouldn't
break that trust.

56:09.699 --> 56:11.451
Would you give me a
little help here, Dad?

56:11.534 --> 56:13.078
{\an3}Oh, yeah.
Help him out.

56:13.161 --> 56:14.829
Tell him how you
almost cheated on me

56:14.913 --> 56:16.289
with your secretary.

56:16.372 --> 56:19.459
"Almost" doesn't count.

56:19.542 --> 56:21.086
I resisted temptation.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.754
{\an1}BRANDON:
Tomorrow, I'll resist.

56:22.837 --> 56:24.255
Tonight I'm gonna
roll in the mud,

56:24.339 --> 56:26.257
and do me a favor--
you two don't show up.

56:26.341 --> 56:27.967
It could be very
traumatic for all of us.

56:28.051 --> 56:31.471
He's got a point.

56:31.554 --> 56:33.098
{\an3}I don't feel right
about this, Jim.

56:33.181 --> 56:34.933
Wait a minute, if you
guys really cared,

56:35.016 --> 56:35.850
you wouldn't be running
off to Hong Kong

56:35.934 --> 56:37.393
and leaving me all
alone, now, would you?

56:38.603 --> 56:40.605
(audience clapping)

56:47.195 --> 56:47.904
Good job.
Hey, look,

56:47.987 --> 56:49.614
{\an1}you want to get
something to drink?

56:49.697 --> 56:51.407
{\an3}Uh, sure. I need
to find the ladies room.

56:51.491 --> 56:52.617
Okay.

56:57.205 --> 56:58.289
Grrrowl!

56:58.373 --> 56:59.666
(laughs)

56:59.749 --> 57:00.583
Okay... (sighs)

57:00.667 --> 57:02.460
{\an1}Think you can close
this deal by yourself?

57:02.544 --> 57:04.337
Well, let's just say
that it's in the bag.

57:04.420 --> 57:05.338
You know what
I'm saying?

57:05.421 --> 57:06.673
I do know what
you're saying.

57:06.756 --> 57:07.674
Godspeed, my friend.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.509
{\an3}(snaps fingers)
Waiter!

57:15.765 --> 57:18.059
{\an1}My personal favorite's
always been Orion.

57:18.143 --> 57:19.018
Out here in the desert,

57:19.102 --> 57:20.812
you can see why he's
called "The Hunter."

57:20.895 --> 57:22.313
{\an1}You're right. I can
see his bow.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.023
{\an1}I can see
his moustache.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.109
{\an3}He doesn't have a
moustache, sweetheart.

57:26.192 --> 57:27.527
You know, Tom,
I was thinking

57:27.610 --> 57:29.362
about that bit
in Act One with Carl

57:29.445 --> 57:30.488
and the doctor.

57:30.572 --> 57:33.491
If we have them looking
at the stars, then that leads

57:33.575 --> 57:36.369
right into the whole scene
about having a-a soul mate.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.086
{\an3}I just got buzzed
by Security.

57:45.170 --> 57:46.546
Is there a problem?

57:46.629 --> 57:49.549
{\an3}The McKay kid was in Rollins'
car making a phone call.

57:49.632 --> 57:51.551
{\an3}Security picked it
up on the scan.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.052
Who was he calling?

58:06.274 --> 58:07.483
Where are you
taking me?

58:07.567 --> 58:08.902
Back to my pleasure palace.

58:08.985 --> 58:11.070
{\an3}Ooh! I don't think
I can wait.

58:11.154 --> 58:15.200
{\an1}Yes, you can. So behave, or I
may have to discipline you.

58:15.283 --> 58:16.492
{\an3}Well, I gotta
tell you, Elle...

58:17.827 --> 58:19.537
{\an3}I've been a very,
very bad boy.

58:19.621 --> 58:21.247
Really?

58:21.331 --> 58:23.458
Give me some sugar, baby.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.062
Hey, easy, lover.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.231
What's this?

58:46.314 --> 58:48.274
{\an1}(man's voice):
Honey, like you didn't know.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.111
(shrieks)

58:56.366 --> 58:57.116
How could you possibly

58:57.200 --> 58:59.244
tell Brandon that I
was "with" Alison?

58:59.327 --> 59:00.620
I said it was a mistake.

59:00.703 --> 59:01.788
{\an3}Kelly,
you're the one

59:01.871 --> 59:04.082
{\an3}that did the big
undercover act, okay?

59:04.165 --> 59:05.667
{\an3}I'm sorry if we
got the wrong idea.

59:05.750 --> 59:07.252
No, I don't care what <i> you</i> think.

59:07.335 --> 59:08.503
It's Brandon
that I'm worried about.

59:08.586 --> 59:10.088
Look, whatever he said,

59:10.171 --> 59:12.340
{\an1}my guess is the Alison
rumor's the least of it.

59:12.423 --> 59:14.217
(applause nearby)

59:14.300 --> 59:15.969
{\an3}I gotta agree
with David.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.638
Has anybody
seen Brandon?

59:18.721 --> 59:20.348
{\an3}He said he'd
be back by now.

59:25.353 --> 59:27.063
I guess she hasn't
seen him, huh?

59:32.568 --> 59:35.029
{\an5}RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Two-car accident
on Bob Hope Drive.

59:35.113 --> 59:36.864
Police and ambulance
are on the scene right now.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.659
If you're driving on Interstate
10 approaching the...

59:39.742 --> 59:40.994
(radio static crackles)

59:43.579 --> 59:45.581
(siren blares)

59:55.425 --> 59:57.844
(siren wailing)

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:10.648
Good evening.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:11.941
Good evening, Officer.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.026
I was just, uh...

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.028
{\an1}having a little trouble
with the stereo.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.237
Have you been
drinking today?

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.613
No, sir.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.700
Well, I-I-I did
have a couple of beers.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.702
{\an1}A couple?
Yeah.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.371
But that was... 12 hours ago.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.748
Yeah, just a few
in the morning, huh?

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:28.374
{\an3}Could you find
your license

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.667
and registration
for me, please?

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.377
Yeah. Listen...

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.212
Here's my, uh... here's my
license. I'm not exactly...

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.881
Take it out of
your wallet, please.

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.674
...sure where the, uh,

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.676
{\an1}registration
is... Officer.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.762
{\an1}You see, it's, uh,
it's not my car.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.098
So, Mr. Walsh,
whose car is this?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.516
{\an1}Uh... A friend
loaned it to me.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.063
Mr. Walsh, I'm gonna

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.439
have to ask you to step
out of the car, please.

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.233
Officer, this, this isn't mine.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.526
Just step out of the car.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:03.743
Step to the back of
the vehicle, please.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.704
Place your hands on
the trunk. Step back

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:09.082
{\an3}and spread your
feet apart.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.458
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:12.168
Place your hands on the trunk.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.341
(garbled police radio
transmission)

01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:26.766
LOU:
<i>You want to get a move on!</i>

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.851
Mr. Rose is waiting.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:29.936
So what's the first stop?

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.771
I just do what
Mr. Rose says.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:34.232
{\an3}He says you want to see some
locations for the movie.

01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:36.442
He says you're
gonna like 'em.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.194
Good.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.126
{\an1}Good morning.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:01:59.090
Where's Charley?

01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:00.883
He went up in the other car.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.595
Have a newspaper.
It's a long ride.

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:23.489
Val, wake up.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.491
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.492
Brandon, cut it out!

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.494
{\an3}Go ahead and ask me where
I've been all night.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.495
Go ahead, ask me.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.496
I don't want to know.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.665
{\an1}I waited for you until
about 4:00 in the morning.

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.667
{\an3}That's because I was
detained by the police,

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.503
{\an3}thanks to a joint you had over
the sun visor in your car.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.839
{\an1}In my car?
What happened to my car?

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:40.840
Your car is fine.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.134
{\an3}It didn't spend all night
in a holding cell.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.846
Brandon, what are you doing?

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.514
Where are you going
with my stash?

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.515
(toilet flushes)

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.766
What is your problem?!

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.686
You're lucky this wasn't in
your car when they searched it.

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.355
Brandon,
I'm sorry you got busted.

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.815
Do you have any idea what could
have happened to me

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.525
if I would have tested positive
for use?

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.527
{\an1}Do you?

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.361
Well, nothing bad happened.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.529
Everything turned out okay,
right?

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.157
(sighs)

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.701
No. (chuckles ruefully)

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:11.037
I promised my parents
I wouldn't do anything stupid

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.914
after they left,
and everything I've done

01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:15.208
from that point forward
has been a monument to idiocy.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.418
Well, not everything.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:18.419
Don't start with me, Val.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.213
I'm supposed to be looking out
for you, too.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.716
Well, I don't need anybody
looking out for me,

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:24.717
including you.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.095
Good, your car's out front.
Have a safe drive.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.098
I'm gonna find my own way home.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.435
(door opens)

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.937
(door closes)

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:42.568
Oh, no, I'm not taking
any of the credit.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.903
You're a quick study.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.780
{\an3}Well, I mean, you have
a lot of patience.

01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:48.032
{\an3}I've been through a lot
of instructors trying

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:49.200
{\an3}to learn a
decent backhand.

01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:51.077
{\an1}Well, I do have
a lot of patience,

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.080
but that's only for people
who I feel have a lot of talent.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.915
Aw.

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.750
{\an1}Ooh...
See you at the luncheon.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:58.584
Yeah.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.586
{\an3}So Steve, you're back
with Robin.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.755
What happened to Elle?

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.131
That just didn't work out.

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:05.967
{\an3}What do you mean,
it didn't work out?

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.553
Uh, it didn't work out.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.220
What do you mean,
it didn't work out?

01:04:09.303 --> 01:04:10.179
You said it was in the bag.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.390
Yeah, well, it never made it
into the bag,

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:14.100
and it's just
one of those things.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.977
I don't understand.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:19.230
Look, it's really embarrassing,
and, uh,

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:21.107
it's something that I thought

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.608
could never possibly happen
to me,

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.277
so I don't wanna talk about it.

01:04:26.153 --> 01:04:27.905
You couldn't perform?

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.115
(laughs)

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.449
I didn't <i> want</i> to perform.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.492
She's a he.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:32.660
She's a wha...?

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:34.245
She's a he.

01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:35.288
So help me, Brandon,

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.789
if you tell one person
about this,

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.457
I swear, I'll hunt you down
and beat you senseless!

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.251
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:43.004
{\an3}No, I'll never tell a soul,
I promise, I promise.

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:46.132
I've done a few things
in my life I'd rather forget.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.925
Nothing quite this extreme,
but...

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:51.929
All right, so tell me
what happened with you

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.181
and your little rendezvous
with that vampiress.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:56.434
Rendezvous-us interruptus,
my friend.

01:04:56.517 --> 01:04:58.811
So at least there was
some good news.

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:01.314
I'm glad you made it here
anyway, bro.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.441
I'm just glad I survived.

01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:04.775
{\an3}Don't take any
wooden nickels, bro.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:05.776
{\an1}(laughs)

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.819
I'm serious, Brandon!

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.195
{\an1}MAN:
Fore!

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:10.239
Hey, man, that's my hacienda!

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.825
You break a window, you're gonna
have to pay for that!

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.624
Well, not that I'm so happy

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:20.666
with the circumstances,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.502
but it looks like we needed
this time together

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:24.712
to go over your speech.

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:26.464
I guess I was
a little distracted.

01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:28.215
{\an3}It's not very good,
is it?

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:30.134
{\an3}Oh, honey, there's always
room for improvement.

01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:32.470
I'm gonna run down the hall

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:34.472
{\an3}and get some ice
before we get into this.

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:36.182
{\an3}Ray, can you take care
of the patient?

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.224
Sure, Mrs. Martin.

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:41.520
Donna...

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.314
Get away from me.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.734
Stay away from me!

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:49.820
Look, it just kills me to see
you sitting there hating me.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.366
I don't hate you.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.868
Well, I'm looking at you
and that's what I see.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:59.705
I just don't get it.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.209
I mean, this was supposed
to be a nice weekend for us.

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:05.336
I should never have come here.

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:07.630
{\an3}I told you I shoulda
stayed in L.A.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:09.715
And when we got here,
I tried to go back, didn't I?

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.051
Look, we both know

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.261
that no good ever comes out
of me mixing

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.346
with your college friends,

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:17.723
{\an3}does it?

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:20.559
Donna?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.603
(door opens)

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.689
All right, let's get started.

01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:30.111
{\an3}Look, you guys have a lot
of work to do,

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.113
{\an3}so I'll see you
both later.

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:34.448
Okay, we'll save a seat
for you right up front.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:38.202
Oh, come on now,
you can get along

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:40.037
without him
for a couple of hours.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.081
(door closes)

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:44.875
Okay, let's see.

01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:56.512
Kel...

01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.058
{\an1}I want to apologize
for what I said yesterday.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:03.602
I wasn't exactly myself.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.272
{\an1}I don't think you really
left me for Alison.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:09.483
You seemed pretty devoted
to the idea at the time.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.444
Well, I guess maybe in a way,

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:14.280
it would be easier for me
if that was the case.

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:16.407
{\an1}See ya.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.786
{\an3}You can still love someone
without being married.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.913
{\an3}Why does everything
have to be over?

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.957
Kelly, I proposed to you.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.208
And Dylan showed up
with some world tour.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:29.003
I mean, it was like a weird
contest between the two of you,

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.171
and I was caught in the middle.

01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:32.298
Do you really think I'd do
something like that to you?

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.841
I'm saying that
that's how it felt.

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:36.177
{\an1}Well, let me tell you
how it felt from my side.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.471
I asked the one person
I ever wanted to spend

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:42.683
the rest of my life with to tell
me that she felt the same way.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.602

I was just another guy.

Yeah, well,
you're going your way

and I'm going mine.

01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:55.029
I guess I didn't know you
as well as I thought I did.

01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:57.990
So you're never
gonna forgive me?

01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:00.493
It's not a question
of forgiveness, Kelly.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.578
There's just no going back.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:07.958
Well, I'm not gonna give up
on you yet.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.377

And who told you that?

01:15:38.992 --> 01:15:40.327
It's pretty obvious.

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:42.287
Look, just because
I don't say anything,

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.455
doesn't mean I don't know.

Hi.

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:22.452
Well, I guess to start with, I
should level with all of you

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:24.830
about how my arm ended up
in this sling here.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:28.250
Well, no one
gets in the way of an Alpha

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:29.710
when everything's half off
at Ann Taylor's.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:30.961
(laughter)

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:34.339
You know the Tri-Delt who dared,
she's still in the hospital.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:38.343
So that's the new Alpha--
no one pushes her around.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:45.642
{\an3}Although the alums I've
met here this weekend

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:47.019
can hold their own, too.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.979
That's the whole meaning
of tradition, isn't it?

01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:52.107
Passing strength down,
one to the next.

Well, I'm sorry
you feel this bad.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.299
What the hell happened
to you, chief?

01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:33.231
Okay, so, you were hallucinating
Jim and Cindy, right?

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.233
Like good cop, bad cop?

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.109
You know my parents.

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.904
{\an1}It was more like good cop,
goody-goody cop.

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.280
Right.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:42.407
{\an3}Yeah, the subconscious,
it's a bitch.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.077
And so is Valerie.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.913
You know, I'm very impressed
you were able to resist her.

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:51.083
{\an3}I never could. I always...
I always caved.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.418
Bro, I told you, I had a little
help from two apparitions

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.503
and one chief of police.

01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:57.297
Not to mention a surprise
visit from Kelly Taylor.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.884
I wish I hadn't mentioned her.

01:18:00.967 --> 01:18:04.221
I don't know how I could've
misread her so much.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:06.098
You wouldn't believe the trip
I had planned.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.557
We were going...

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.727
Bro, I had four years
of engagement ring payments

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:13.939
lined up for me.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.857
How'd she manage to get us
both so turned around?

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.609
I don't know.

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.403
But if it's any consolation,

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.863
you have multiple lifetimes
to think about it.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.449
Oh, that's comforting,
thank you.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.577
Answer me this, Bran...

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.454
how'd we end up on this bus?

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.290
I don't know,

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:36.169
{\an1}but for once in my
life, I'm in no hurry.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.840
Neither am I.

01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:56.440
Ah, you're up.

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:57.774
(sighs)

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.317
Time to go?

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.777
Well, there's no hurry.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.113
Ray will be here
in a few minutes.

01:19:03.196 --> 01:19:06.825
{\an3}I think I've got just about
everything packed up.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.994
I guess I was tired.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.955
{\an3}Well, it's been
a big couple of days.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.168
Did I mention to you
how many compliments

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.502
I got on my daughter's

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.504
inspired speech?

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.840
Hmm, about a thousand times.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:24.134
I want to make sure you know how
very proud I am of you.

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.303
I do.

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:30.849
I know it must seem like I give
you a hard time sometimes...

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:31.808
about things.

01:19:31.892 --> 01:19:33.643
About "things"?

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:36.688
About Ray mostly.

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:40.150
Mom, you just really
don't understand.

01:19:40.233 --> 01:19:41.651
{\an3}But I'm trying
to, honey.

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:43.820
I really am.

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:46.406
Because after seeing
him here this weekend...

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:49.701
I know he can fit in.

01:19:49.784 --> 01:19:53.163
Seeing how worried he was
about you when you fell,

01:19:53.246 --> 01:19:55.665
{\an3}even I could see how much
he cares about you.

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:58.084
Of course, your father
could see it all along,

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.545
and I fought it every inch
of the way, but...

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:03.757
Maybe love does conquer all.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.218
I don't even believe
that anymore.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.512
Well, not all.
I mean, it's not always

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:10.013
going to be easy, of course not.

01:20:10.096 --> 01:20:13.600
You have no idea how hard
it's been lately.

01:20:13.683 --> 01:20:15.852
{\an4}(knocking)
RAY:
Hey, Donna, you ready?

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:17.521
Just a second.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.439
Unless you're saying you
don't love him anymore.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.943
No. I do.

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:24.402
I do love him.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.988
In the long run, maybe
that's all that matters.

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.373
{\an3}Hi, Ray.
Hey.

01:20:36.456 --> 01:20:38.083
You take good care of my baby.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.417
I will.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.799
You ready, Donna?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.764
See you later.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:04.776
Well, that was fun, bro.

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:05.819
Take it easy.

01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:07.279
Yeah, give me a call, man.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.280
All right, will do.

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.990
{\an1}Check out the
"for sale" sign.

01:21:10.073 --> 01:21:13.118
{\an3}Uh, Bran, that sign
says "sold."

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:28.425
{\an1}It's all been giving a good
"Utz" to market prices...

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:30.969
{\an1}Randy, let me call you
right back, okay?

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.637
Bye.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.723
{\an4}What's that "sold"
sign all about?
I am so glad

01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:37.017
to see you. Your mom and dad
have been trying to call you.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.685
{\an3}What's going on?
I faxed them an offer

01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:41.313
from Mr. Chu that they
could not turn down.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:42.981
{\an3}I can't believe
it myself.

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.024
{\an3}All cash.

01:21:44.107 --> 01:21:45.483
Short escrow. In and out.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:46.860
Everyone's laughing.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.945
(exaggerated laugh)

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.575
(sighs)

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:58.163
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Message four. 9:00 a.m.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.873
(beep)

01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:02.876
Dylan, it's Christine again.

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:05.712
I just got back to my
office at the Bureau.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:07.505
I don't know if you got
my other messages,

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.467
but please don't do anything
until you talk to me.

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:13.136
The people in the desert
who you asked me about

01:22:13.219 --> 01:22:15.347
are very dangerous.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:18.975
We're very close to arresting
the men who killed your father

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.019
and this is not the time
to get involved.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:25.190
Don't do anything, okay?

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:29.194
No, Christine... not okay.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.737
(beep)

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.656
{\an5}CINDY:
Brandon, Brandon,
come and look.

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:34.783
Smile, smile,
look at the camera.

01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:39.162
{\an1}One, two, three, go.
Go!

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:40.830
(cheering)

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:43.750
{\an5}JIM:
We should take
the candles out.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:47.045
Okay, ready, and...
Big cut.

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:47.921
Ooh.

01:22:48.004 --> 01:22:51.007
Kiss the camera again.
(door opening)

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.510
All right here you go,
one, two...

01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:54.344
Hey, Val.

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:57.972
{\an1}Hey, you're not drinking
again, I hope.

01:22:58.056 --> 01:23:00.350
No. I'm doing this sober.

01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:03.103
I'm not even going to ask
why you're watching this.

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:05.355
{\an3}Because I've gone
Smurf crazy.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.568
{\an5}Okay...
JIM:
Keep going.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.904
{\an3}Okay, come on, Valerie,
wave at the camera.

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.614
{\an6}BRANDON:
Look at that.
Wave at the camera.

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:15.907
You were expressive,
even back then.

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.410
I remember this party.

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.911
{\an3}So do I.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.581
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
you got back safely.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:27.293
{\an1}I hope you can
forgive me.

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.087
{\an3}I think there's a
little too much history

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.880
between us not to.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:32.716
{\an1}Yeah, we can't
let sex and drugs

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:34.175
{\an1}ruin our long-time
friendship.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:38.596
Friends is all we should be.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.765
{\an3}JIM:
Ooh, very good, very good.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.225
Look at that!

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.271
Well, back to reality.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.273
Yep.

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:51.276
{\an3}Did you check out the
"sold" sign in the front yard?

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:54.112
Yeah, I was hoping
it was a mistake.

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.281
We've got two weeks
to get out of here.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:23:59.951
Well...

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:02.871
{\an1}a lot can happen
in two weeks.
