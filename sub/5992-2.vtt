<i>(U HTRED)
I was born an ealdorman of England.</i>

00:03.762 --> 00:07.922
Uhtred, son of Uhtred of Bebbanburg,
welcome to the Christian world.

00:08.082 --> 00:10.642
<i>Heir to the Northumbrian lands
of Bebbanburg.</i>

00:11.002 --> 00:12.882
- You have your stone, amber?
- Yes.

00:13.042 --> 00:17.482
Our ancestors took this land
and you will die for it if needed.

00:17.802 --> 00:20.562
<i>I was 12 years old
when I first went to war.</i>

00:20.722 --> 00:22.362
(LORD UHTRED) Kill them all!

00:22.522 --> 00:24.242
<i>I saw my father killed.</i>

00:24.402 --> 00:25.842
<i>My uncle took my /ands</i>

00:26.002 --> 00:28.082
<i>and pledged his allegiance
to the Danes.</i>

00:28.242 --> 00:32.642
My advice for you
is to never cross Ubba

00:32.802 --> 00:34.642
and never, never fight him.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.522
<i>Stolen by the invaders,
along with the Saxon girl Brida,</i>

00:38.682 --> 00:42.442
<i>I became first</i> a <i>slave
and then</i> a <i>son to Earl Ragnar.</i>

00:42.602 --> 00:44.522
<i>That was my family. My life.</i>

00:44.682 --> 00:47.442
<i>Young Ragnar, my brother,
and Brida, my lover.</i>

00:47.602 --> 00:49.962
- <i>(LAUGHING)</i>
- <i>Fate had made me</i> a <i>Dane.</i>

00:50.802 --> 00:52.962
<i>And then fate brought betrayal.</i>

00:53.122 --> 00:55.202
(YELLING)

00:57.482 --> 01:00.482
I will not stand by
and have everything taken from me.

01:01.682 --> 01:03.082
Bebbanburg's mine!

01:03.242 --> 01:05.202
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

01:05.642 --> 01:06.962
Horses.

01:57.162 --> 01:59.242
(UHTRED) Head for the woods.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.162
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

02:16.562 --> 02:19.842
Go right.
There's a gully over that ridge.

02:39.682 --> 02:42.002
(AELFRIC) Hoof-marks.
There must be hoof-marks.

02:42.802 --> 02:45.882
There must be hoof-marks
somewhere.

02:47.362 --> 02:49.602
Fetch more men, I want him found.

02:49.762 --> 02:53.642
We'll go as far as Mercia if need be,
but I want him found

02:53.802 --> 02:55.882
and I want him dead.

02:56.562 --> 02:59.162
(UHTRED) Looked like my father.
- He knows you're alive,

02:59.322 --> 03:01.682
- he'll keep looking for you.
- Let him.

03:01.842 --> 03:04.642
I'm going to kill him
and take back what's mine.

03:04.802 --> 03:07.002
He has an army,
choice of the Danes.

03:07.162 --> 03:08.642
- All you have is me.
- No.

03:09.602 --> 03:11.322
We have Ubba.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.162
We go to him with our story

03:13.322 --> 03:15.882
and with his army,
we avenge Ragnar's death

03:16.042 --> 03:17.922
and we take back Bebbanburg.

03:18.082 --> 03:21.442
- It's that simple?
- Yes.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.122
Yes. Tsk, tsk.

03:46.722 --> 03:48.322
(UHTRED) Brida.

03:50.962 --> 03:52.762
Bflda.

03:53.362 --> 03:54.722
Sing me a song.

03:54.882 --> 03:57.042
I won't, and I'm not your skald.

03:57.202 --> 03:59.682
True, and what's more,
you'd frighten the birds.

03:59.842 --> 04:01.202
What?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.762
There's a taste in the air.

04:07.162 --> 04:08.642
Death.

05:21.642 --> 05:23.122
(ARROW WHIZZES)

05:36.682 --> 05:38.202
(GROANING)

05:43.722 --> 05:46.282
Who did this?
Who sacked the village?

05:46.442 --> 05:49.442
- (MAN) I cannot move.
- Your back is broken.

05:49.602 --> 05:51.002
(MAN GRUNTS)

05:52.282 --> 05:54.922
- Who did it?
- You know who did this.

05:55.082 --> 05:56.562
Danes did this.

05:56.722 --> 05:58.322
(UHTRED) Why?

05:58.842 --> 06:01.642
Why should the Danes attack a village
that feeds them?

06:01.802 --> 06:03.442
Revenge.

06:03.722 --> 06:06.282
But since when have Danes
need an excuse to kill?

06:06.442 --> 06:09.802
(BRIDA) Revenge? Revenge for what?

06:10.602 --> 06:12.162
Huh?

06:13.282 --> 06:15.322
Revenge for what? And I'll end it.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.522
An uprising north of here.

06:19.442 --> 06:22.802
A Saxon slave.
He killed his master at a wedding party.

06:24.722 --> 06:26.882
(MAN CHOKING)

06:27.122 --> 06:29.562
What was the name of this slave?

06:30.762 --> 06:33.722
- Huh?
- You speak English well for a Dane.

06:33.882 --> 06:35.522
His name.

06:35.682 --> 06:37.282
(GROANS)

06:38.562 --> 06:39.882
Uhtred.

06:46.482 --> 06:48.282
End it.

06:49.322 --> 06:51.162
En--

06:51.322 --> 06:53.362
(MAN GROANING)

06:54.562 --> 06:56.562
(MAN GRUNTS)

07:03.042 --> 07:05.682
- Say it.
- (BRIDA) Say what?

07:05.922 --> 07:08.322
- What you are thinking.
- You have a turd

07:08.482 --> 07:11.442
- where there's supposed to be a mind.
- (LAUGHS) Thank you.

07:11.602 --> 07:14.522
We should never have gone
to Bebbanburg.

07:14.762 --> 07:17.922
We should have let them believe
that you were dead.

07:21.242 --> 07:23.042
No, you're wrong.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.762
I want them to know that I'm alive.

07:26.402 --> 07:30.162
I need them to know that I'm alive
because they hold what's mine.

07:31.882 --> 07:34.282
- I feel better for it.
- Yeah?

07:34.442 --> 07:37.122
So does a dog pissing on a tree.

07:38.122 --> 07:40.442
- You wish me to bark?
- What we needed to do

07:40.602 --> 07:45.082
was to ride south to the Chieftain Ubba
and tell the story of Ragnar's death.

07:45.442 --> 07:48.082
- We'll do it now.
- Now, there's a second story

07:48.242 --> 07:52.002
- about a slave who killed his master.
- Ubba knows Ragnar was my father.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.282
He knows nothing.
I doubt he'll remember.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.802
He will believe the story he hears first
and he will kill you.

08:02.962 --> 08:05.242
If you could write,
you could write to him.

08:08.882 --> 08:10.402
If he could read, heh.

08:14.642 --> 08:16.042
You've left us no choice.

08:16.202 --> 08:20.202
We must find Ubba,
and hope he believes you.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.962
(BELL TOLLING)

08:31.602 --> 08:33.761
(MAN) Did you get any of his pork
this morning?

08:33.922 --> 08:36.522
(MAN 2) Bloody sausages...
(MAN 3) Take it all out.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.962
Thank you.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.642
(MAN) Father Beocca.

08:52.802 --> 08:54.322
Father.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.522
Segwall.

08:57.322 --> 08:59.722
I'll see you in the Kings Hall.

09:18.482 --> 09:20.282
My lord?

09:22.322 --> 09:25.762
My Lord Alfred,
it is I, Father Beocca.

09:25.962 --> 09:28.762
My lord, the king has called council.

09:29.522 --> 09:31.722
(ALFRED) Do not look at me, Father.

09:31.882 --> 09:36.762
- I am a sinner. I'm a grievous sinner.
- We are all sinners, my lord.

09:36.922 --> 09:39.722
And I am married.
I should never have married.

09:39.882 --> 09:42.722
He sends temptation to test us.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.282
When we fail,
he sends the Danes to punish us.

09:45.442 --> 09:48.522
I should never have married,
I should've joined the church.

09:48.682 --> 09:50.442
I should've gone to a monastery.

09:50.602 --> 09:52.762
God would've found
a great servant in you,

09:52.922 --> 09:55.402
but I feel he has other plans.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.962
If your brother were to die,
it'd be to you people would turn.

09:59.122 --> 10:01.802
Oh, pray God he does not die.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.682
What kind of a king would I be?

10:04.842 --> 10:07.242
You will be God's king, my lord.

10:07.402 --> 10:10.442
You've been blessed and chosen
by the Holy Father in Rome.

10:10.602 --> 10:12.522
You would be God's king.

10:14.722 --> 10:17.202
- I've seen who torments--
- Must be banished.

10:17.362 --> 10:19.642
No, she should be brought
into your service.

10:19.802 --> 10:21.602
No. No, I could not.

10:21.762 --> 10:25.002
You will resist her.
You will let him see your strength.

10:25.682 --> 10:28.562
You will thank him for tempting you
and then praise him

10:28.722 --> 10:31.442
for resisting the temptation.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.522
Notwithstanding,

10:39.562 --> 10:42.762
I have news
you may wish to take to council.

10:42.922 --> 10:45.962
- What news?
- English uprising, lord, in the north.

10:46.122 --> 10:47.682
It was defeated,

10:47.842 --> 10:51.002
but the nobleman responsible
was Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

10:51.162 --> 10:52.722
I know him.

10:52.882 --> 10:54.962
He was taken by the Danes
as a child,

10:55.122 --> 10:57.082
a God-fearing child.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.722
- Clearly his heart remains English.
- He lives?

10:59.882 --> 11:01.922
I believe so.

11:02.722 --> 11:06.722
He is a warrior, lord. They say he killed
his Danish master and 40 men.

11:06.882 --> 11:09.922
Knows their ways, speaks
their language. He'd be useful.

11:10.082 --> 11:13.602
- You could mention him in council.
- Why would he kill his master?

11:14.002 --> 11:16.482
For blood? For money?
For pleasure?

11:16.642 --> 11:18.802
- For England, lord.
- But how do we know?

11:18.962 --> 11:23.202
He may well be just one more pagan
with a busy sword.

11:23.362 --> 11:27.002
- But I know him, lord.
- No, Father Beocca, you knew him once.

11:27.162 --> 11:29.402
You knew him as a child.

11:29.802 --> 11:32.362
I could send word into the country,
God willing.

11:32.522 --> 11:34.322
He's a ghost. He's a pagan rumour.

11:34.482 --> 11:37.722
Should he become flesh and blood,
then he may merit a mention.

11:37.882 --> 11:41.282
However, my faith,
I reserve for God alone.

11:45.642 --> 11:49.082
Now, about this girl,
you may be right about her.

11:49.722 --> 11:51.642
Bring her into my personal service.

11:52.522 --> 11:54.802
And pray for me.

11:55.322 --> 11:56.722
As always, my lord.

12:00.602 --> 12:03.082
(MAN) Danes are there.
Why else would they be back?

12:03.242 --> 12:05.442
I honestly know there was...

12:06.242 --> 12:07.962
Alfred.

12:09.002 --> 12:11.522
King Edmund of East Anglia
writes for an army.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.962
An attack by Danish chieftain,
Earl Ubba, is inevitable.

12:15.122 --> 12:16.682
This was two days ago.

12:17.802 --> 12:21.642
A march to fight at a place of their
choosing is not worth considering.

12:21.802 --> 12:24.242
- To say the least.
- I'm of a mind to decline.

12:24.602 --> 12:27.642
- And rightly.
- Ubba, he is the Dane

12:27.802 --> 12:30.362
whom King Edmund
has fed and watered in the past?

12:30.522 --> 12:32.802
- He is.
- Perhaps in the hope he would pass

12:32.962 --> 12:35.562
through East Anglia
on his way to invading Wessex.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.282
It's my opinion
that Edmund deserves but silence.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.202
Too harsh, Young Odda.

12:40.362 --> 12:43.842
It was Edmund's hope to convert
the Danes from pagan to Christian

12:44.002 --> 12:47.442
beginning with charity.
For that, he deserves praise, surely.

12:47.602 --> 12:50.762
- True, if that was his hope.
- Edmund is a Godly man.

12:50.922 --> 12:53.642
We have no reason to mistake
his actions for cowardice.

12:53.802 --> 12:56.322
(ATHELRED) Regardless of intentions,
barring a miracle,

12:56.482 --> 12:58.202
East Anglia will fall to Danes.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.762
He shall have our prayers
for such a miracle.

13:00.922 --> 13:03.002
- He will need them.
- (ATHELRED) He will not

13:03.162 --> 13:04.962
have one man of Wessex,
we are agreed?

13:05.522 --> 13:06.842
- Yes, lord
- Aye.

13:08.362 --> 13:11.682
Then we must therefore recognise
that we now stand alone.

13:12.602 --> 13:14.802
The last kingdom of England.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.362
It will soon be men of Wessex
staring across a field at the army.

13:18.522 --> 13:21.482
We must be ready.
We must pray, we must prepare.

13:21.642 --> 13:26.122
Odda, I require Mercia, Lundene
and East Anglia be watched carefully.

13:26.282 --> 13:27.962
- Forward knowledge is everything.
- It is done, my lord.

13:28.122 --> 13:31.722
Scribe, I require the forges
of every town burning, night and day.

13:31.882 --> 13:34.002
We need the iron
those fires can proffer.

13:34.162 --> 13:36.082
(SCRIBE) Yes, my lord.

13:36.562 --> 13:38.962
Most of all, I require men.

13:39.682 --> 13:43.122
Strong, fighting men
who are prepared to die

13:43.282 --> 13:47.802
because that, in the end,
is what it will take to save us.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.042
The blood of men.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.482
Ravn used to say, "Never fight Ubba."

14:00.922 --> 14:04.242
Looks like East Anglia's
just made that mistake.

14:07.922 --> 14:09.802
(BRIDA) We should stay away for now.

14:09.962 --> 14:12.002
Build our own fire.

14:13.842 --> 14:17.682
Ubba is unpredictable.
He takes his orders from the gods.

14:17.842 --> 14:20.882
I know he only listens to a sorcerer.

14:21.042 --> 14:22.482
And he's half mad.

14:22.642 --> 14:24.482
How will you approach him?

14:24.642 --> 14:26.322
As a man.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.482
It has to be done.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.122
Yes, it has to be done.

14:33.282 --> 14:35.802
But we need to guard your life.

14:36.722 --> 14:39.802
- How?
- I don't know.

14:46.202 --> 14:48.442
We should hump tonight.

14:51.562 --> 14:53.482
We should. It's written.

14:54.082 --> 14:56.162
That we should hump?

14:56.882 --> 15:01.162
Our destiny is to hump, tonight.

15:01.322 --> 15:02.962
(CHUCKLES)

15:15.002 --> 15:18.162
- I'm enjoying the thought of it.
- That's all you'll enjoy tonight.

15:18.322 --> 15:19.922
(LAUGHS)

15:23.162 --> 15:27.242
(MOANING AND PANTING)

15:27.402 --> 15:30.122
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What? What is it?

15:30.282 --> 15:32.802
I think I have it.

15:34.082 --> 15:36.162
We take a hostage,

15:36.322 --> 15:39.602
a shield, a guarantee for your life.

15:39.762 --> 15:41.242
Who?

15:41.442 --> 15:43.122
I don't know.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.282
Someone he can't do without.

15:46.682 --> 15:49.882
Storri, his sorcerer.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.202
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

16:02.922 --> 16:04.962
(DANE 1) Who is this woman?

16:05.762 --> 16:07.322
Why is she not on her back?

16:07.482 --> 16:10.962
(UHTRED) Not that it's your concern,
but she's for Storri.

16:11.122 --> 16:13.042
A Saxon whore, from Ubba.

16:13.202 --> 16:15.202
I've seen you before.

16:15.362 --> 16:18.362

16:24.882 --> 16:27.482

- This church is mine by order of Ubba.
- Master Storri, I have a gift for you.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.962
- Really?
- She's from Earl Ubba.

17:11.122 --> 17:12.882
A woman?

17:13.202 --> 17:15.482
Why would Ubba send a woman?
I have no need.

17:15.642 --> 17:18.602
She's a sorceress. He wishes her dead,
but is afraid of a curse.

She has the face of a she-wolf.
Does she bite?

17:32.802 --> 17:36.682
- Yes, she bites.
- Leave her with me.

- I said be quiet.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.522
Then I'll wait for him here.

I'll wait for Ubba here.

18:51.082 --> 18:53.522
You have had the night
to consider my offer.

How do you answer?

18:55.482 --> 18:56.802
(LAUGHING)

- Are you dead or breathing still?
- (GUTHRUM) With luck he's dead.

We allow far too many of them
to live as it is.

19:03.162 --> 19:05.322
- You allow nothing.
- He lives.

19:05.722 --> 19:07.522
It's God who decides who lives.

19:07.682 --> 19:10.122
I would say your God
has left you hanging, sir.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.682
(EDMUND) If he has done so,
it's because it is his will.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.202
Take him down,
and do not to let him fall.

19:18.362 --> 19:21.522
- And ale, and for the Earl Guthrum.
- (GUTHRUM) I don't understand.

19:21.682 --> 19:24.122
We do this all the time.
We allow half to live.

19:24.282 --> 19:26.802
I say we kill them all.
All but the young women.

19:26.962 --> 19:28.762

- And give the man some ale.
- Earl Ubba?

19:38.202 --> 19:39.642
If I may speak freely.

19:39.802 --> 19:41.202
I know you.

19:41.362 --> 19:45.282
I'm Uhtred Ragnarson. I am here
with the truth of how my father died.

19:45.442 --> 19:48.842
Yes, you are Ragnar's slave
and you killed him.

19:49.002 --> 19:52.762
I don't know what you've heard,
but Earl Ragnar was killed by Danes.

19:53.722 --> 19:57.082
His former ship's master Kjartan
and his half-blind son Sven,

19:57.242 --> 20:01.162
- they led the attack on a sleeping party.
- Can't see we're entertaining?

20:01.322 --> 20:04.202
Lord Ubba, I'm telling you,
Ragnar was killed by Danes.

20:04.362 --> 20:07.642
- You be quiet, boy. And you will wait.
- Kill him.

20:07.802 --> 20:09.122
(UBBA) Not another word.

20:09.282 --> 20:11.082
Bar the doors, he does not leave.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.602
Guthrum is right.
We are entertaining a king,

20:13.762 --> 20:15.642
so no more interruptions.

20:15.802 --> 20:18.082
I just have to know, who is that?

20:18.482 --> 20:19.842
Hmm?

20:22.122 --> 20:24.842
- His eyes are watching me.
- And me.

20:25.002 --> 20:26.482
Who's what?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.442
- Who?
- The half-naked image there.

20:31.242 --> 20:32.562
Who is it?

20:32.722 --> 20:34.042
(SIGHS)

20:34.202 --> 20:35.762
That is Saint Sebastian.

20:35.922 --> 20:37.922
A former Roman soldier
who found God.

20:38.082 --> 20:39.882
(GUTHRUM) Found him where?

20:40.042 --> 20:42.562
He f--
He found him in his heart, not--

20:45.242 --> 20:48.562
- Do you wish me to tell you his story?
- I have time.

20:54.202 --> 20:57.122
(EDMUND) The emperor, discovering
that Sebastian had found God,

20:57.282 --> 20:59.802
ordered him to renounce his faith,
he refused.

20:59.962 --> 21:04.202
So then the emperor ordered
that he be filled full of arrows

21:04.362 --> 21:06.802
and yet he lived.

21:08.722 --> 21:10.562
- He lived?
- Yes, he did.

21:10.722 --> 21:12.762
- Is this true?
- Of course, it's true.

21:13.482 --> 21:16.882
God saved St Sebastian and God
should be praised for that mercy.

21:17.042 --> 21:18.402
For how long did he live?

21:19.802 --> 21:21.282
Well, sadly he--

21:21.442 --> 21:24.642
He then ordered him
to be clubbed to death.

21:26.482 --> 21:29.362
- So he died?
- He went to heaven, so he lived.

21:30.642 --> 21:34.202
- I heard mention of this heaven.
- What is this heaven?

21:34.362 --> 21:37.962
Heaven is Valhalla to Christians
without fighting, feasting, humping.

21:38.322 --> 21:40.202
Heaven is heaven.

21:40.362 --> 21:42.402
It's not heathen.

21:43.682 --> 21:45.922
But to answer
your very first question,

21:46.082 --> 21:47.722
I have considered your offer

21:47.882 --> 21:51.362
and, yes, I will continue to rule
East Anglia as you suggest.

21:51.682 --> 21:53.362
I will suffer your presence.

21:53.522 --> 21:57.322
I will provide you
with horses, food, coin,

21:57.482 --> 21:59.002
and hostages.

21:59.162 --> 22:01.682
I will do all that you demand.

22:02.362 --> 22:07.842
But only if you, Lord Ubba,

22:08.002 --> 22:10.162
and all of your men

22:10.482 --> 22:12.482
submit to God.

22:13.002 --> 22:14.562
That is my demand.

22:14.722 --> 22:17.122
You must be baptised.

22:20.962 --> 22:25.402
You must stand in a barrel of water
and they pour more water over you.

22:27.162 --> 22:29.482
- They want to wash me?
- No.

22:29.642 --> 22:33.082
- Your scent upsets them, Ubba.
- No, to cleanse you of your sins.

22:33.242 --> 22:36.402
There is only one God,
and I demand that you serve him.

22:36.562 --> 22:38.722
- Kill him now!
- Why must I serve him?

22:38.882 --> 22:41.402
Because God is great,
all-powerful, magnificent.

22:41.562 --> 22:44.282
Have him stop his yapping
and prove it!

22:44.442 --> 22:47.882
Ah. Agreed. Prove to me
your God is great. Prove it.

22:48.042 --> 22:51.002
Prove, prove, prove-- Look, here!

22:51.162 --> 22:53.282
God spared Saint Sebastian.

22:53.442 --> 22:55.602
- But the man died.
- It was God's will.

22:55.762 --> 22:57.682
Would God protect you
from my arrows?

22:57.842 --> 23:01.842
- If he was all-powerful, he would?
- Yes, if it was God's will, he would.

23:02.002 --> 23:03.882
(UBBA) So let us try.

23:05.002 --> 23:09.002
We shall shoot arrows at you,
and if you survive,

23:09.162 --> 23:10.602
(CHUCKLES)

23:11.082 --> 23:14.082
we will all be washed.

23:14.242 --> 23:17.162
- Including Guthrum here.
- Why not?

23:23.722 --> 23:25.482
Very well.

23:28.802 --> 23:32.162
I will continue to be king

23:33.002 --> 23:36.242
but we will dispense
with the need for baptisms.

23:36.402 --> 23:38.282
The washing.

23:38.442 --> 23:39.922
I withdraw my request.

23:40.082 --> 23:43.402
But you claim your God
is all-powerful.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.642
I want it proven.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.642
Strip him. Archers.

23:56.082 --> 23:57.762
(GUTHRUM) Wait.

24:03.802 --> 24:05.922
Tell me truthfully,

24:06.642 --> 24:08.562
are you afraid?

24:09.442 --> 24:11.402
God is great.

24:13.362 --> 24:15.122
We will see.

24:20.322 --> 24:21.722
Shoot

24:23.522 --> 24:25.562
- Shoot.
- Uh-uh-uh.

24:26.362 --> 24:30.202
They are my men
and only I tell them when to shoot.

24:32.082 --> 24:33.842
Shoot

24:36.322 --> 24:37.842
(PANTING)

24:39.002 --> 24:41.882
Do you wish to be clubbed
or are the arrows sufficient?

24:47.162 --> 24:50.642
You come a long way, boy,
to tell me that it was Danes and not you

24:50.802 --> 24:52.522
that killed Ragnar.

24:52.682 --> 24:54.322
It was Kjartan and Sven, lord,

24:54.922 --> 24:56.602
and others.

24:57.642 --> 25:00.042
It's the truth.
Why else would I be here?

25:00.202 --> 25:02.162
To spy, to lie.

25:02.322 --> 25:04.202
- No, lord.
- (UBBA LAUGHS)

25:04.402 --> 25:06.682
- Perhaps to kill me?
- No, lord.

25:06.962 --> 25:10.842
- Have you been washed?
- Odin is my God.

25:11.002 --> 25:13.002
(GUTHRUM)
But you have been washed?

25:14.002 --> 25:17.362
- Yes, lord.
- How did it feel?

25:19.602 --> 25:22.842
- The washing?
- Cold, lord. The water was cold.

25:23.402 --> 25:24.722
(GUTHRUM) Nothing else?

25:25.002 --> 25:27.362
I was a child, lord. Now I'm a Dane.

25:27.882 --> 25:29.962
Yeah, a Dane.

25:35.322 --> 25:37.362
So, now let us see

25:38.362 --> 25:40.802
if Odin will protect you
from the arrows.

25:42.042 --> 25:45.122
- I like this game. Strip him.
- (UHTRED) Keep away from me.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.442
- Not another step.
- (UBBA) Archers.

25:48.682 --> 25:50.242
- I have a hostage.
- (UBBA) What?

25:50.402 --> 25:51.962
- I have Storri.
- Stop.

25:52.122 --> 25:55.042
If I die, he dies.
If I die, your sorcerer dies,

25:55.202 --> 25:57.842
- and you're without his guidance.
- He lies, I smell it.

25:58.002 --> 26:01.042
I have proof. His runes.

26:03.722 --> 26:07.562
- Storri will be returned to you.
- Take his head from his shoulders.

26:07.722 --> 26:11.242
- Guthrum, be quiet.
- Have them open the doors.

26:11.962 --> 26:14.682
I will release Storri
when I am clear of this place.

26:14.842 --> 26:18.802
- (UBBA) You go nowhere.
- Then he dies. Your sorcerer dies.

26:20.642 --> 26:22.802
Have them open the doors.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.242

26:42.242 --> 26:45.682
And I am telling you the truth
about Ragnar.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.882

That's good.

Did he hear you?

27:14.282 --> 27:16.842
He did not. Not a word.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.682
- What did he say?
- That he'll kill me.

27:19.842 --> 27:21.602
Nothing else?

27:21.762 --> 27:23.522
Where's Storri?

27:23.922 --> 27:25.922
(BRIDA) What did he say?

27:27.962 --> 27:30.802
- He's naked.
- It was necessary.

27:31.202 --> 27:33.162
He has a branch up his arse.

27:33.322 --> 27:35.802
Which is why he's naked.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.722
(STORRI GROANS)

27:47.002 --> 27:50.882
Uhtred,
he must have said something.

27:51.242 --> 27:55.402
He believes the lie.
He believes that I killed Ragnar.

28:00.442 --> 28:02.442
(STORRI GRUNTING)

There's nothing more to do.

28:09.442 --> 28:10.922
(SIGHS)

28:11.762 --> 28:14.322
We should put distance
between us and this place.

28:14.482 --> 28:15.882
And go where?

28:16.162 --> 28:18.402
Anywhere that's not here.

28:19.642 --> 28:23.482
- I say we go to young Ragnar.
- He's in Ireland.

28:23.642 --> 28:27.002
- Then we go to Ireland.
- How? In what? We sail in what?

28:27.162 --> 28:29.602
- And with whom? Danes?
- Then we wait for him.

28:29.762 --> 28:32.322
What if he doesn't return, what then?

28:35.642 --> 28:37.802
Accept it, we lost.

28:38.602 --> 28:43.642
- We're alive and breathing for a reason.
- Brida, we are no longer Danes.

29:29.322 --> 29:31.922
Tell me what you need
and I'll tell you a price.

29:32.282 --> 29:35.242
A warrior sword to last a lifetime.

29:35.402 --> 29:37.242
What are you?

29:37.642 --> 29:40.122
Saxon or Dane?

29:41.322 --> 29:42.642

29:45.442 --> 29:47.602
It'll take some time
to make her right,

29:49.562 --> 29:51.842
which means she'll be expensive.

29:52.002 --> 29:54.042
She's right, I'll pay in silver.

29:54.202 --> 29:55.802
How much?

29:56.042 --> 29:57.522
Ten pieces. Half now.

29:57.682 --> 29:59.282
(LAUGHS) Six. No more.

29:59.442 --> 30:01.362
Eight, and I'll make her my finest.

30:01.522 --> 30:04.402
Eight, if she is not your finest,
you'll be her first.

30:10.882 --> 30:15.002
I want this stone set into the handle.

(SERVANT) Ale, my lord?

30:43.242 --> 30:45.962
- You stand too close, girl.
- (ALFRED) Yes, just a little.

30:46.122 --> 30:49.602
- To take away the taste of the gruel.
- You stand too close.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.242
It is broth, not gruel.

30:52.402 --> 30:53.962
- Is it?
- (CHUCKLES)

30:54.122 --> 30:58.042
Well, I think it is. You should be
thanking God of its goodness

30:58.202 --> 31:01.002
and the banishment
of those awful cramps.

31:01.162 --> 31:03.002
I am happy to eat as you eat.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.842
You are saintly, my dear.
Father Beocca, join us for breakfast.

31:07.002 --> 31:10.082
- I dare you.
- Alas, my lord, I've already eaten.

31:10.242 --> 31:11.842
(ALFRED) You're fortunate.

31:12.002 --> 31:14.922
Bad news, lord.
Your nephew, Aethelwold.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.042
- (AELSWITH) Isn't it always?
- He's drunk.

31:17.202 --> 31:18.962
He's sleeping in the palace garden.

31:19.122 --> 31:22.362
Should I take him to the king?
It's the second time this week.

31:22.522 --> 31:25.602
May God strike him down, painfully.

31:30.002 --> 31:31.442
(sNoRES)

31:32.002 --> 31:33.522
(GRUNTS)

31:33.682 --> 31:35.722
- What? What?
- (LEOFRIC) On your feet, boy.

31:35.882 --> 31:37.202
Wait, wait, wait.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.362
(BEOCCA)
Come on, the king wants to see you.

31:40.602 --> 31:42.202
Drunk!

31:42.802 --> 31:44.522
What, again?

31:44.682 --> 31:46.242
Do you think this is fit?

31:46.402 --> 31:48.802
Out, all of you, leave us.

31:50.962 --> 31:54.522
- Do you think this is fit?
- I have been mistreated.

31:54.682 --> 31:58.202
You saw this for yourself.
I demand that this--

31:58.362 --> 32:00.722
- This bear is punished.
- (KING AETHELRED) Aethelwold,

32:00.882 --> 32:03.962
your years do not hide the fact
you are a disappointment.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.682
- Why?
- That need to ask tells your father

32:06.842 --> 32:09.922
- all he needs to know.
- What?

32:10.082 --> 32:13.362
That you are an unsuitable heir.
That is what.

32:16.362 --> 32:19.162
- Then I will change.
- You should.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.162
- I will.
- Look, all I ask

32:21.322 --> 32:24.442
is that you become a man,
and quickly.

32:24.802 --> 32:26.322
Today.

32:27.082 --> 32:30.242
Today, I promise.

32:35.922 --> 32:38.082
Am I excused?

32:44.642 --> 32:46.202
My lord.

32:50.282 --> 32:53.042
I'm not convinced he is my son.

32:53.962 --> 32:57.922
If his mother was not already dead,
I'd have her beheaded for adultery.

32:58.082 --> 33:00.082
(LAUGHING)

33:03.482 --> 33:06.682
If I'm to fall in the battles
that will come,

33:07.122 --> 33:09.082
he cannot be king.

33:10.602 --> 33:13.002
- You favour Alfred?
- I do.

33:13.562 --> 33:17.882
Even though he is often weak
in body?

33:18.442 --> 33:22.282
His illness does not tie him to bed,
shows the strength of my brother.

33:22.442 --> 33:26.242
Alfred is my heir. He knows it.

33:27.242 --> 33:31.362
And when the time comes,
Odda my friend,

33:31.642 --> 33:35.122
you must steer the witan
to make this choice.

33:36.322 --> 33:37.682
My lord.

33:43.362 --> 33:45.122
(U HTRED) It's done.

33:45.842 --> 33:47.442
Should be safe for now.

33:47.602 --> 33:50.282
They say Danes rarely come here.

33:50.882 --> 33:54.762
What did Storri say to you
to make you bind his mouth and, uh...

33:54.922 --> 33:56.242
He threw a curse.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.202
Saying what?

33:58.402 --> 33:59.882
It's not important.

34:00.042 --> 34:02.202
I responded with the branch.

34:07.002 --> 34:08.322
What are you doing?

34:08.482 --> 34:10.242
You know what I'm doing.

34:10.402 --> 34:12.681
I'm removing the last curse
with a kiss.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.562
I don't want to.

34:20.002 --> 34:23.641
If you want to go to the Danes,
then go find a new lord.

34:26.722 --> 34:28.922
It's me they wish to kill.

34:29.081 --> 34:31.681
- You sound like a child.
- I'm offering a choice.

34:31.842 --> 34:34.641
- Talking through your arse.
- I'm sitting on my arse.

34:34.802 --> 34:38.002
Your arse is cleverer than you,
it can do two things at once.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.601
Thank you.

34:40.402 --> 34:42.641
Your tongue is sharp, woman.

34:42.802 --> 34:44.641
(LAUGHING)

34:45.282 --> 34:47.842
- Show me again.
- No.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.121
You're right.

34:52.482 --> 34:54.962
We can't go to young Ragnar.

34:57.482 --> 35:00.162
But we should wait for him
to find us.

35:00.322 --> 35:03.962
Which he will.
He will want to know the truth.

35:06.642 --> 35:09.322
In the time between, we stay alive.

35:10.402 --> 35:12.602
We pass the time.

35:13.162 --> 35:14.242
Doing what?

35:18.802 --> 35:20.202

She is exactly as I'd hoped.

37:03.802 --> 37:05.602

- We said eight.

37:05.762 --> 37:07.682
She's worth ten.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:14.202 --> 37:16.042
And your woman.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.642
- Danes or Saxon?
- Take your pick.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.762
Five or more.

37:23.802 --> 37:25.722
Make her sing.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.682
We should leave.
There are men looking for us.

37:32.842 --> 37:34.322
(BRIDA) From Ubba?
- I don't know.

37:34.482 --> 37:36.562
Saxons and Danes
are looking for us.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.122

There'll be others.

I can't go home without help.

you should forget Bebbanburg.

No.

40:13.522 --> 40:15.442
No, I won't vanish.

40:17.122 --> 40:21.162
Nothing changes. Kjartan and my uncle
will pay for Ragnar's death

40:21.322 --> 40:24.562

- But how?

40:24.722 --> 40:26.642

- You said yourself, we only have Ubba--
- The English.

If we're dead to the Danes,
we have no choice.

40:33.562 --> 40:34.882
There is no England.

40:35.042 --> 40:38.962
- The Danes have England.
- No, there is one place, south of here.

40:39.162 --> 40:42.242
- It's Wessex.
- They'll take one look and kill you.

40:42.402 --> 40:44.642
Whereas Ubba will kill me
as an Englishman.

- Huh.

You sound like a Dane.

Why do you dress as a warrior
when you're a farmer?

42:36.042 --> 42:38.002
Farmer, am I?

42:38.402 --> 42:40.882
I'd wager this farmer against you
at any time.

with Alfred.

43:55.802 --> 43:57.722
And I will inform Alfred
you're here.

43:57.882 --> 44:01.282
- We need their weapons, Father.
- Why not inform the king?

44:01.442 --> 44:03.162
The king is busy.

44:03.322 --> 44:04.642
But you will like Alfred.

44:19.562 --> 44:21.122
I do.

44:22.522 --> 44:24.362
It's beautiful.

44:25.282 --> 44:29.042
- You could rest here. It's so quiet.
- (ALFRED) Peaceful.

44:29.802 --> 44:35.042
The Romans, they built this courtyard
forjust that purpose. Tranquillity.

44:35.362 --> 44:38.362
- You're Alfred?
- I am.

44:39.642 --> 44:41.962
- My lord.
- (ALFRED) You are Uhtred.

44:42.762 --> 44:45.042
I hear word
you are a considerable warrior.

44:45.202 --> 44:48.802
(LAUGHS) Not been tested, lord.
Not yet.

44:49.402 --> 44:50.922
And I've been lucky.

44:51.082 --> 44:53.162
Well, luck is good.

44:53.322 --> 44:55.802
Or so my own warriors say.

44:56.242 --> 45:00.322
Now, I haven't quite worked out
the theology of luck.

45:00.642 --> 45:03.482
Can there be luck if God disposes?

45:05.642 --> 45:08.002
If your God is with you,
you're a lucky man.

45:09.882 --> 45:12.882
Yes. You're right.

45:13.042 --> 45:15.722
Simply put, but you are right.
With me.

45:15.882 --> 45:18.202
We shall talk inside briefly.

45:31.722 --> 45:34.242
I spend much of my time in here.

45:35.282 --> 45:37.282
Do you read, Uhtred?

45:37.442 --> 45:39.682
(UHTRED) Schooled as a child
by Father Beocca.

45:39.842 --> 45:41.362
I was not a good student.

45:41.522 --> 45:44.882
- There's much to know outside letters.
- (ALFRED) I'm certain there is.

45:46.282 --> 45:49.162
But do not underestimate
the power of the written word.

45:49.322 --> 45:52.562
When a man dies, if nothing is written,
he is soon forgotten.

45:52.842 --> 45:55.162
For instance,
who is remembering Earl Ragnar?

45:55.322 --> 45:57.242
You know of Ragnar?

45:57.922 --> 46:01.522
Father Beocca has talked
much about you, Uhtred.

46:01.682 --> 46:03.882
He believed you a prisoner.

46:04.042 --> 46:06.122
Slave to Earl Ragnar.
ls that the case?

46:06.282 --> 46:08.202
Ragnar was a father to me.

46:10.362 --> 46:12.082
I loved him.

46:12.362 --> 46:15.402
Yet in Eoferwic,
they're saying that you killed him.

46:15.562 --> 46:17.002
Theyfie.

46:20.122 --> 46:23.362
Kjartan. Kjartan.
ls that how you pronounce it?

46:23.522 --> 46:25.442
- Kjartan.
- Kjartan,

46:25.602 --> 46:28.322
has benefited most
from Ragnar's death.

46:28.482 --> 46:31.322
He has taken his place
and is Earl Kjartan now.

46:31.482 --> 46:34.362
- A great lord, with ships.
- That's written down?

46:34.522 --> 46:37.122
Whatever I discover about enemies
is written down.

46:39.002 --> 46:41.602
It's in Kjartan's interest to kill you,
is it not?

46:41.762 --> 46:45.202
He would not want Ragnar's son
to hear a different tale.

46:45.802 --> 46:47.722
He would not wish him
to hear the truth, no.

46:47.882 --> 46:50.842
(ALFRED) No, and the Chieftain Ubba,

46:51.002 --> 46:53.282
although he himself
has now travelled north,

46:53.442 --> 46:56.962
he has sent men to Mercia
asking of your whereabouts.

46:57.122 --> 46:59.242
But not your welfare, I surmise?

47:00.402 --> 47:02.042
How do you come by all of this?

47:02.202 --> 47:05.442
I have eyes and ears
in each of the kingdoms.

47:09.562 --> 47:11.242
One day,

47:11.442 --> 47:15.562
it is my hope
that all kingdoms will become one,

47:16.082 --> 47:19.042
united under one God.

47:19.482 --> 47:20.802
One king?

47:22.522 --> 47:24.922
If all men can agree, yes.

47:26.522 --> 47:30.722
All that remains of England
is Wessex.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.642
The birth of an England,

47:33.802 --> 47:38.722
the idea of a single kingdom

47:38.922 --> 47:41.122
called England

47:41.762 --> 47:43.562
has to begin here.

47:45.042 --> 47:46.482
There is nowhere else.

47:46.642 --> 47:49.242
But for how long
will Wessex remain?

47:49.722 --> 47:54.242
The fate of Wessex will be determined
by Englishmen, all Englishmen.

47:54.442 --> 47:59.682
Only by joining together and saving
Wessex can we have England.

48:00.042 --> 48:05.042
Only by saving Wessex can we have
a Northumbria.

48:05.202 --> 48:07.202
A Bebbanburg.

48:07.722 --> 48:09.882
And if Wessex can't be saved?

48:10.042 --> 48:12.762
Then we are all no more.

48:13.482 --> 48:15.322
(BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE)

48:16.642 --> 48:17.962
Prayers.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.962
(EXHALING FORCEFULLY)

48:25.122 --> 48:27.362
And a little discomfort.

48:32.682 --> 48:34.722
I will summarise.

48:35.082 --> 48:37.962
The Danes are gathering
a great army.

48:38.122 --> 48:40.482
- They have gathered an army.
- Gather where?

48:40.642 --> 48:43.082
They moved upriver
from Lundene to Readingum.

48:43.242 --> 48:45.082
They are settling as we speak.

48:45.242 --> 48:47.162
You say Ubba is north,
so who leads?

48:47.322 --> 48:50.882
- The Earl Guthrum leads them.
- I know Guthrum.

48:52.842 --> 48:55.442
We will need every advantage.

48:55.762 --> 48:58.162
And Father Beocca considers you,

48:58.322 --> 49:00.522
Uhtred of Bebbanburg,
to be an advantage.

49:02.002 --> 49:04.682
Whereas I believe you are here
solely to hide,

49:04.842 --> 49:07.042
to save yourself.

49:10.002 --> 49:11.562
I look at you

49:11.722 --> 49:13.962
and I see a Dane.

49:14.322 --> 49:19.482
I see Uhtred of Nowhere,
who cares for no one but himself.

49:21.722 --> 49:25.082
Now, I must go to prayers.
You will join me?

49:26.882 --> 49:30.122
- If my lord will excuse me.
- (BRIDA) Us both.

49:31.122 --> 49:32.762
Of course.

49:33.002 --> 49:35.362
I expected as much.

49:36.082 --> 49:38.362
- Father Beocca.
- (BEOCCA) Lord?

49:38.522 --> 49:41.402
- Take your guests for refreshments.
- I will, my lord.

49:41.562 --> 49:45.162
They may remain in Winchester,
but I hold you responsible.

49:45.322 --> 49:47.042
Yes, lord.

49:51.642 --> 49:54.402
You should've gone along and prayed,
it would've bonded you.

49:54.562 --> 49:55.882
He believes we are pagans.

49:56.042 --> 49:58.882
What Alfred believes
is that the Danes abandoned you.

49:59.042 --> 50:01.922
Ubba has abandoned us,
there are other lords.

50:02.082 --> 50:04.082
Most, if not all, follow Ubba.

50:04.242 --> 50:08.122
- Believe me, you have been abandoned.
- You know everything about Danes.

50:08.282 --> 50:10.722
(BEOCCA) This way.
I wanna show you something.

50:13.682 --> 50:15.762
The Charters of Bebbanburg.

50:15.922 --> 50:20.042
- (BEOCCA) Yeah, the land books. Yeah.
- You kept them safe.

50:20.282 --> 50:21.882
I have shown them to Alfred.

50:22.042 --> 50:25.722
He knows you are the ealdorman
by right.

50:27.802 --> 50:29.762
I will continue to keep them safe,

50:29.922 --> 50:34.322
but, Uhtred,
you must behave like an ealdorman.

50:43.602 --> 50:47.082
The charters have no meaning.
Northumbria belongs to the Danes.

50:47.242 --> 50:49.882
(BEOCCA) It does not belong to Danes,
it has been stolen.

50:50.042 --> 50:53.122
(BRIDA) You want wealth, you take it.
You can't ignore what's true.

50:53.282 --> 50:55.362
If the Danes are at Readingum,
I'll go.

50:55.522 --> 50:57.322
- What?
- For what purpose?

50:57.482 --> 50:58.802
(UHTRED) For knowledge.

50:58.962 --> 51:01.202
(BEOCCA) We have knowledge
and you should stay away.

51:01.362 --> 51:04.002
For new knowledge.
You know where they're settling,

51:04.162 --> 51:07.522
- but you don't know why.
- We know their number and position.

51:07.682 --> 51:09.322
Not their intention.

51:09.482 --> 51:11.242
Am I a prisoner?

51:12.002 --> 51:14.482
Their intention is to attack.

51:14.882 --> 51:16.322
VVhen?

51:17.002 --> 51:18.522
Spring. It is always spring.

51:18.682 --> 51:21.042
I'll go to Readingum. Where is it?

51:21.202 --> 51:23.202
- It's too dangerous.
- (UHTRED) Not for me.

51:23.362 --> 51:26.002
- I'm a godless Dane, remember?
- (BRIDA) Why spy for Alfred?

51:26.362 --> 51:28.122
He is an ealdorman of England.

51:36.882 --> 51:38.362
(DOOR OPENS)

51:39.282 --> 51:40.762
(BEOCCA) Lord.

51:41.162 --> 51:44.202
Regarding the conversion
of the pagans to Christianity,

51:44.362 --> 51:48.082
- Yes, lord?
- how do we decide what is proper?

51:48.242 --> 51:50.322
To enlighten them or to kill them?

51:51.322 --> 51:55.042
Spreading God's word
is, of course, our mission.

51:55.202 --> 51:58.362
But I fear that the pagans,
the true pagans,

51:58.522 --> 52:02.002
must first witness
and feel his power.

52:09.762 --> 52:13.042
- Uhtred will return?
- Yes, he will return.

52:13.202 --> 52:15.602
Yes, but how will he return?
As who? As what?

52:15.762 --> 52:18.362
- I know this boy--
- But this boy is now a man.

52:19.962 --> 52:23.322
- I know his soul.
- Father Beocca, he has no soul.

52:23.482 --> 52:25.002
And you say yourself,

52:25.162 --> 52:28.482
the pagans need to feel
the power of God.

52:28.642 --> 52:31.362
It is written, now, here.

52:31.802 --> 52:33.562
You may leave me.

52:34.362 --> 52:37.762
We shall see what the days bring,
my lord.

53:00.202 --> 53:02.362
If resting through the winter
was their intention,

53:02.522 --> 53:04.402
they would've remained in Lundene.

53:05.962 --> 53:09.522
It's you who's Alfred's spy.
Next step is to kill for him. Will you?

53:09.682 --> 53:13.522
Answer me this, if we were to cross
and find Guthrum, what would happen?

53:13.682 --> 53:15.162
He'd kill us both.

53:15.322 --> 53:16.722
We owe them nothing.

53:18.322 --> 53:21.202
Alfred needs to know about the Danes,
I need his trust.

53:21.362 --> 53:24.842
(BRIDA) You'd think he'd deliver you
Bebbanburg, what if you're wrong?

53:43.242 --> 53:46.202
Alfred, you have called council
for what reason?

53:46.362 --> 53:49.442
Lord, forgive me, it may be no reason,
but we have a pagan

53:49.602 --> 53:51.682
who claims knowledge
regarding the Dane army.

53:51.842 --> 53:53.282
- (AETHELRED) Pagan?
- Forgive me, lord,

53:53.442 --> 53:57.362
he is Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
I vouch for his word.

53:57.722 --> 54:02.282
- (AETHELRED) Uhtred.
- Lord.

54:05.842 --> 54:08.002
I've been to Readingum,
watched the Danes.

54:08.162 --> 54:12.362
Their intention is not to settle. If it were,
they would've remained in Lundene.

54:12.522 --> 54:14.922
You are saying, what,
they intend to attack?

54:15.082 --> 54:16.442
- I am, lord.
- (ODDA) We know.

54:16.602 --> 54:19.482
- Come spring, they'll be at our door.
- (UHTRED) They will be within days.

54:19.642 --> 54:21.522
- I'm sure.
- How can you be sure?

54:21.682 --> 54:23.962
- The ground is sodden--
- They made sacrifices.

54:24.122 --> 54:26.962
Ordinary warriors caught
and killed birds, jackdaws.

54:27.122 --> 54:29.042
This is done in days before battle.

54:29.202 --> 54:32.122
- And they are hungry.
- Perhaps they have eaten these.

54:32.282 --> 54:34.482
They've many men and horses,
few supplies.

54:34.642 --> 54:37.682
They'll first seize a town
rich with grain and livestock.

54:37.842 --> 54:40.482
I don't know the country well,
but I've travelled.

54:40.642 --> 54:42.642
I believe Abbendum is such a place.

54:42.882 --> 54:47.202
To defeat the Danes, you must
meet them on the road to Abbendum.

54:48.082 --> 54:49.602
They'll be within days, lord.

54:49.762 --> 54:51.482
(ALFRED)
You went to Readingum alone?

54:51.642 --> 54:52.962
With Brida.

54:53.122 --> 54:55.762
- Why alone?
- (UHTRED) Why not?

54:55.922 --> 54:58.402
Because for most your life,
you lived as a Dane.

54:58.562 --> 55:01.602
You look like a Dane,
you speak the language of a Dane,

55:01.762 --> 55:04.162
I surmise you can set a trap
like a Dane.

55:04.322 --> 55:06.722
Agreed, my lord,
he imagines we are jackdaws.

55:06.882 --> 55:08.802
(AETHELRED)
Where on the road to Abbendum?

55:08.962 --> 55:12.522
- Where would you choose to meet--?
- The place called Asec's Hill, lord.

55:12.682 --> 55:15.882
- You or Guthrum would choose?
- I've seen it, the pass narrows.

55:16.042 --> 55:17.402
You cannot be out-flanked.

55:17.562 --> 55:19.962
For Danes to fight uphill,
it'll be difficult,

55:20.122 --> 55:22.442
they'll be confident,
they don't fear Saxons.

55:22.602 --> 55:25.042
Why? Why do they not fear us?

55:25.202 --> 55:27.802
They believe you to be farmers,
nothing more.

55:29.082 --> 55:32.762
So even with the sun in their eyes,
which is possible, they will climb

55:32.922 --> 55:34.522
and that can be to our advantage.

55:34.682 --> 55:37.642
To our advantage, he says.
You've been here for days

55:37.802 --> 55:39.602
and you claim to be of Wessex?

55:39.762 --> 55:43.082
This is nonsense.
This is all far too convenient, my lord.

55:43.242 --> 55:46.602
My lord, my sword was made
by a Saxon. My sword is for Wessex.

55:46.762 --> 55:49.242
- Don't interrupt a noble when speaking.
- (AETHELRED) Odda.

55:49.402 --> 55:52.322
I believe this man and this bag of rags
to be impostors.

55:52.482 --> 55:56.202
- No army marches as winter approach--
- Young Odda, enough from you!

55:57.802 --> 55:59.442
My lord.

56:03.722 --> 56:05.122
You.

56:06.642 --> 56:09.882
You have spoken
and given this council much to discuss.

56:10.042 --> 56:11.562
(UHTRED) My lord.

56:14.202 --> 56:16.722
Alfred, he's here at your invitation.
What now?

56:18.042 --> 56:21.962
Should the Danes march,
we must face them.

56:22.682 --> 56:25.922
And I would rather be at the top of a hill
than on the flat.

56:27.002 --> 56:30.082
I say we march to Asec's Hill.

56:31.362 --> 56:35.362
But take him.

56:36.682 --> 56:38.922
- Take them both, make them secure.
- Lord.

56:39.082 --> 56:41.682
What is this?
I have spoken the truth.

56:42.522 --> 56:45.722
- I have spoken the truth. Father Beocca.
- (BEOCCA) My lord, please.

56:45.882 --> 56:50.562
- Beocca, help me! Beocca!
- (BEOCCA) Have faith!
