WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:09.610
CHILD: My mom said my city,
New Orleans,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.779
will never float away.

00:11.812 --> 00:16.584
My city, New Orleans,
is a mighty city.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.453
When the storm came
and the winds roared,

00:19.487 --> 00:23.157
when the levees let go,
my city stayed,

00:23.191 --> 00:25.693
and souls were reborn.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.832
FEMALE REPORTER :
Hurricane Katrina is

00:31.865 --> 00:33.701
a Category 5
and headed towards the city.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.805
Mayor Nagin has ordered
a mandatory evacuation...

00:37.838 --> 00:40.174
Detective Lasalle.
(indistinct male voice
speaking over phone)

00:40.208 --> 00:42.243
Uh-huh.
MAN: ...we got a man down...

00:42.276 --> 00:44.678
Where?
(man speaks
indistinctly over phone)

00:50.884 --> 00:52.086
Thank God you're here,
Detective.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.154
What happened?

00:53.187 --> 00:54.188
He shot my husband!

00:54.222 --> 00:55.823
He drove away!

00:55.856 --> 00:57.325
Help him, please!

00:57.358 --> 00:58.792
I already called an ambulance!

00:58.826 --> 01:00.094
Call again, Petey!

01:00.128 --> 01:01.862
Go! What's his name?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.564
Phil.
LASALLE: Phil, look...

01:03.597 --> 01:06.066
All right, we're gonna get
you some help, okay?

01:09.403 --> 01:10.871
Did you see who
did this to you?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.573
It-it hurts!

01:12.606 --> 01:14.842
I know. Look, just keep
talking to me, okay?

01:14.875 --> 01:17.345
I can't. It's too hard.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.180
Damn it, talk to him, Phil!

01:19.213 --> 01:21.449
That's a strong woman
you got here, Phil.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.417
Look, I wouldn't want
to cross her, okay?

01:23.451 --> 01:26.254
She's gonna make
a beautiful mother.

01:26.287 --> 01:29.757
The guy... the guy who shot me
had a... blue tattoo.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.759
Blue tattoo?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.627
Of what?

01:33.661 --> 01:36.730
N-Nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.733
What?
Phil?

01:39.767 --> 01:40.868
Phil!

01:40.901 --> 01:42.203
Oh, no! Please!

01:42.236 --> 01:43.137
Oh, my God,
please help him!

01:43.171 --> 01:44.738
Give me some room.

01:46.907 --> 01:47.908
Oh, my God.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.310
No, no, no, no, no.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.145
No! Help!

01:51.179 --> 01:53.647
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:53.681 --> 01:56.384
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:56.417 --> 01:58.819
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:58.852 --> 02:00.154
* How, how, how, how

02:00.188 --> 02:02.256
* Hey, hey

02:08.396 --> 02:09.830
* You gotta come on.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.748
Work.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.250
BRODY: Our waitress:
Ellen Hunt.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.320
Worked here for two years.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.754
Cashier: Todd Calhoun.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.557
Three years.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.925
Our Marine:
Sergeant Ned Ford.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.896
Worked at the recruiting
office at MCSF.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.699
Surrounding business heard
gunshots, called 911.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.967
Cops saw him, called us.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.669
There's no
surveillance cameras inside,

02:48.702 --> 02:49.903
but we're working
on street cams.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.372
All right.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.274
All right, let me know
what you find out.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.608
Loretta?
Yes.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.211
Ellen and Todd,
both shot in the back.

02:57.245 --> 03:01.615
The blast pattern indicates that
they were shot at some distance.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.985
Most likely a shotgun.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.588
Ford's wounds
tell a different story.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.923
He was shot at
near point-blank range.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.427
The angle of the entry indicates
that the shooter was...

03:13.461 --> 03:14.828
PRIDE: Standing over him.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.930
And he came closer.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.766
I noticed this--

03:18.799 --> 03:22.236
a shiny residue.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.471
Could be transfer
from the killer

03:23.504 --> 03:26.507
when he tried to grab Ford.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.376
I'll get a sample to Sebastian.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.412
Guy comes in here for a cup
of coffee with someone...

03:34.482 --> 03:36.216
...all hell
breaks loose.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.823
It's 12-gauge shells.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.359
That's a pretty big gun
to be carrying around.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.828
Percy.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.397
Footprint?

03:49.430 --> 03:51.399
Yeah.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.267
There's another one.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.302
Yep.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.539
Lasalle...

04:03.844 --> 04:05.846
I got the door.
Copy.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.454
NCIS!
Don't shoot.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.722
Don't shoot, please.
Move!

04:14.755 --> 04:15.723
Come out!
Don't shoot!

04:15.756 --> 04:16.724
Move!

04:16.757 --> 04:18.459
Go to your right.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.629
Against the wall.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.934
What's your name?
:
Oliver Fr-Fray.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.337
He's clear.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.605
You see what happened,
Mr. Fray?

04:31.639 --> 04:34.975
Yeah. This man was
arguing with the Marine,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.411
then-then he sh-shot him.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.646
I got so...

04:38.679 --> 04:40.013
c-cold.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.049
I'll get him a blanket.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.088
Can you describe
this guy?

04:48.121 --> 04:51.792
He was, um, medium weight
and height, uh, I think.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.994
A medium guy with a gun.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.996
That's it?
Anything else you remember?

04:56.029 --> 05:01.535
He had a... he had a blue tattoo
on his, uh, neck and face.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.404
Uh

05:03.437 --> 05:05.773
A blob. Like a Smurf.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.442
A what?

05:08.476 --> 05:09.510
It had-had no sh-shape.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.345
Just... it was just nothing.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.347
All right, Mr. Fray,

05:13.381 --> 05:16.717
we gonna let you warm up first,
but then we gonna talk.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.752
Hey, where you going?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.020
Got to check on something.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.855
Cover for me.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.524
Okay...

05:23.557 --> 05:26.927
Sebastian ol' buddy,
got something special for you.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.961
That's your handwriting.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.130
You recognize my handwriting?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.466
Oh, yeah. Graphology's been
around for almost 400 years.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.702
I could tell you a couple things
about your "S" curves.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.538
Later. Right now, I need you to
take a look at what's in here.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.573
All right, I'll take a look.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.375
Wh

05:41.409 --> 05:44.412
It's a ten-year-old case,
the murder of Phillip Hart.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.448
Killer steals some money, and
then steals a car and kills him.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.484
I thought I was getting evidence
on a... a diner murder.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.052
Yeah, that's coming.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.654
I think the guy that killed
those people killed Hart.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.088
I just want to be sure.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.559
Until then, look, you got to
keep this between you and me.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.627
Don't tell Pride.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.898
Why is it all
moldy and stinky?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.967
Well, after Katrina,
NOPD headquarters flooded

06:07.000 --> 06:08.569
when the levees broke.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.539
This has been tucked away in
an evidence locker ever since.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.541
Mm. Yeah, I got some
boxed Power Rangers

06:13.574 --> 06:15.976
tucked away in my closet, just
waiting for the right time

06:16.009 --> 06:18.078
to bust those...
Sebastian.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.080
Look, now is the time.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.883
You connect something from this
past case to the present one,

06:22.916 --> 06:26.620
we're gonna solve the last
unsolved murder before Katrina.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.689
Bring it.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.935
Night before Katrina,
Phil Hart said

06:41.969 --> 06:44.037
the guy who shot him
had a blue tattoo.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.606
Of nothing.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.908
Yeah, witness at the diner
says the same thing.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.610
Weapon in both cases

06:49.643 --> 06:52.079
is a 12-gauge shotgun.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.781
Has to be the
same killer.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.017
We just need something
to identify him.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.688
I always wanted
to wear a uniform.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.089
Had to wear that
during the storm.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.124
Man, I remember
how much that sucked.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.659
I was visiting friends.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.227
Trying to get out
was impossible.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.929
What'd you end up doing?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.798
Cried. Laughed.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.702
Graffitied anti-FEMA slogans
on refrigerators, you know.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.937
Is this the victim's shirt?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.472
It is.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.807
You find something?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.875
Yeah, some kind of
shiny residue.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.811
Something maybe oil-based.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.112
Here, take a look.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.680
Oh, Miss Loretta
found shiny trace

07:26.714 --> 07:27.948
on one of
the diner victim's arms.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.617
Could be transfer
from our killer.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.819
Did anyone see Mr. Hart
struggle with his shooter?

07:33.854 --> 07:35.523
Only witness was his wife.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.994
WOMAN :
...Hurricane Katrina death toll

07:41.028 --> 07:44.164
was raised to 1,836 today,

07:44.197 --> 07:45.966
and with over 2,000 people
still missing...

07:45.999 --> 07:48.168
What do you mean you
can't find Phil's body?

07:48.201 --> 07:50.003
Morgue was flooded,
bodies were moved,

07:50.037 --> 07:51.672
and we're trying
to figure out where.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.206
:
Oh, my God...

07:53.240 --> 07:54.775
Mrs. Hart...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.109
Billy.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.078
Does your husband
have any enemies?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.913
Anyone who'd want to hurt him?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.049
No. Everyone loved Phil.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.953
I know you tried to help him.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.622
Yeah.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.093
Is there anything else
you remember about that night?

08:13.126 --> 08:16.730
Like I said, I was moving
stuff out the apartment.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.733
I heard the shots...

08:19.767 --> 08:21.902
saw Phil lying there.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.608
Been trying to get back
into the apartment,

08:27.641 --> 08:30.611
but the neighborhood's
still blocked off.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.079
All our stuff's in there.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.982
Phil's music, pictures,
the baby's things...

08:35.015 --> 08:36.183
They're just things.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
To you, maybe.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.054
I mean, you need to let them go.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.190
Look, leave the city.
It's not safe.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.093
It could be months before
you get back in there.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.929
I'll wait.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.200
Guard over there said you might
need this for identification.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.874
You just do your job.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.182
Think it's a girl?
I don't know.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.151
We're at the crime scene
talking to a witness,

09:11.184 --> 09:12.620
and then he
just cut out.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.187
Got to be a girl.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.724
Just told Laurel to head
to her mom's for Thanksgiving.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.692
Afraid it's on hold
for the rest of us.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.193
Hey, that's fine by me.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.863
I'd rather catch a killer
than eat a bird, anyway.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.834
Where's Christopher?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.138
Simple question.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.842
Kitchen, courtyard, traffic?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.245
He was with you
at the crime scene, right?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.147
I know, but I don't know.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.249
She doesn't know.
I really don't.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.652
All right, then,
what do we know?

09:44.685 --> 09:48.088
Our victim: Sergeant Ford.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.290
Stationed at MCSF Algiers.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.259
Single,
did community outreach.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.227
And not just the military.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.830
So, just after Katrina, he was
part of the fight against

09:56.864 --> 09:58.098
the Green Dot initiative.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.668
Government condemned
certain neighborhoods.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.903
Wanted to tear down homes,
turn them into green space.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.173
Only, home owners and volunteers
like Ford said, "No way."

10:06.206 --> 10:08.008
They banded together and
fixed them up themselves.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.743
How about
the other victims?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.144
Ellen Hunt, Todd Calhoun--

10:11.178 --> 10:14.281
both local, single,
no criminal history.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.315
Any connection to Ford?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.750
Not that I could find.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.085
What else?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.386
Well, the witness
at the diner heard

10:19.419 --> 10:21.254
Ford and the killer arguing,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.924
but then saw the killer
shoot Ford first.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.192
That lines up with
our current theory.
Yeah.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.660
Ford was the target.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.829
Well, nothing about his job
suggests that.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.864
Community activist,
living off base...

10:30.898 --> 10:32.299
Maybe this has to do

10:32.332 --> 10:34.234
with something outside
the Marine Corps.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.869
All right, get a warrant.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.938
Go to Ford's house,
see if you can find anything

10:37.971 --> 10:39.873
that'll shed light
on who killed him.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.042
I'll follow up with Wade.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.713
We got to find this guy,
get him off the street

10:45.746 --> 10:47.748
before anyone else gets hurt.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.755
Loretta?

10:54.788 --> 10:58.692
Oh, I know that look.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.695
The greens off is off?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.731
Yeah, sorry to say

11:03.764 --> 11:05.699
that tradition and all

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
of Thanksgiving
is on hold.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.368
Want to do something,

11:08.401 --> 11:11.038
but it just...
there's no... no time.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.407
Dwayne, I've seen you
MacGyver five-course meals

11:14.441 --> 11:17.210
with nothing but tuna,
honey and parsley.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.279
I know you'll
figure out something.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.048
What about the case?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.984
Mm, Ford was shot at close
range, killed instantly.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.754
The pellet shredded his aorta.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.056
The others were
shot at a distance,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.760
same type of gun, ammunition

11:32.793 --> 11:35.829
and disregard for human life.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.198
Well, anything
to help I.D. the killer?

11:38.231 --> 11:39.733
The blue tattoo was

11:39.767 --> 11:41.234
not a blue tattoo!

11:41.268 --> 11:42.903
The, uh, trace on Ford's arm

11:42.936 --> 11:44.371
and the victim's shirt
were a match.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.006
It's actually Loracal.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.341
It's the medicine
used to treat this.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.146
Kind of makes you wonder
about the origin of Blue Man...

11:53.180 --> 11:55.182
Group.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.785
Dwayne, you're here.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.888
Where's Lasalle?

12:00.921 --> 12:04.057
Good question.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.059
What the hell
am I looking at?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.395
That appears to be Argyria.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.264
It's caused by exposure
to colloidal silver.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.201
Lasalle had you working this?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.268
Hmm? No.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.507
Yes, he might've
mentioned a past victim,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.010
who said the killer had
a blue tattoo of nothing,

12:23.043 --> 12:25.345
and that the diner witness
said the same thing.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.848
This past case...

12:27.881 --> 12:29.482
the Hart murder?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.384
Yeah, but look,
the-the only reason

12:31.418 --> 12:33.286
that he didn't bring you
in on it was 'cause he--

12:33.320 --> 12:36.056
'Cause he wanted to be sure
the two cases were connected.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.562
Ford's place-- 836 Desire.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.897
It's a cute house.
I can't believe

12:43.931 --> 12:44.932
they wanted
to tear it down.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.499
Brody.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.481
:
Stairs.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.987
:
What...?

13:18.866 --> 13:20.800
:
He stopped.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.506
He's on the run!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.278
LASALLE:
NCIS! Stop!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.419
Federal Agents!

13:44.892 --> 13:46.960
Stop!

13:52.599 --> 13:55.368
(indistinct conversations,
people murmuring)

13:56.937 --> 13:59.873
What in the hell were you
doing back there?

13:59.907 --> 14:01.608
I'm trying to connect
Ford's murder to a past case.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.411
I came by the house
and saw the door.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.246
We could've killed you--
you know that, right?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.148
Not to mention
we just lost a suspect.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.583
No, no, see, that's just it.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.020
I don't think
he's going anywhere.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.322
Oh, when did you become
a freakin' wizard?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.623
You saw the house.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.192
All the moving boxes,
closets searched?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.961
He was looking for something.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.195
Hello?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.596
I know, he's right here.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.564
It's Pride.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.633
He wants you.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.448
I know that look.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.350
Thanksgiving's off--
am I right?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.019
Funny. Ten-year-old case
rises from the water.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.055
Does that mean the Christopher
I knew ten years ago has, too?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.489
King...

14:49.522 --> 14:51.124
'Cause he only cared
about himself.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.659
No matter his impact on others.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.361
Look.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.229
Old Lasalle is gone
and he ain't coming back.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.630
But I got a lead.

14:57.664 --> 14:58.966
Yeah, I know.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.201
Boxes in the house

15:01.234 --> 15:03.403
that you found on your own.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.374
This is about Phil Hart's widow?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.309
Yes.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.944
Is she still in town?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.313
Please tell me that you
have not contacted her.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.949
No, I wouldn't do that.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.319
Look, I'm sorry I didn't bring
you in on it from the beginning,

15:19.352 --> 15:20.587
all right?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.990
I just needed something solid.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.061
Well, Sebastian may have that.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.729
Get in the car.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.499
Detective...
the Feds are here.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.234
They're taking over
the Hart case.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.403
Don't know who you've
been talking to, Petey,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.737
but the Hart murder's mine.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.406
It's my ticket
up the ladder to Vice.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.608
That car is my evidence.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.577
Hey, you!

15:44.611 --> 15:46.980
I need you to step out.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.384
I said out of the car.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.587
NCIS Agent Pride.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.524
But around this neighborhood,
folks call me--

15:57.557 --> 15:59.726
King-- yeah, so I hear.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.329
The only problem is

16:02.362 --> 16:05.098
the only kings I answer to
is God Almighty and Elvis.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.700
So, cough up what you got
and move on.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.038
Need to learn some manners, son.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.273
This is my case.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.674
All right?
Need to step off.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.276
Devil's costume.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.079
What?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.381
Mardi Gras 2003...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.116
we met.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.417
Although the state
you were in,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.719
I doubt you'd remember,
Detective.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.288
Oh, I remember.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.123
It just has no bearing here,
all right?

16:30.157 --> 16:31.624
I got a widow to answer to.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.060
I'm chasing a murder suspect.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.129
Yeah, and I'm...
chasing a thief.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.630
Someone stole a hundred grand

16:37.664 --> 16:39.432
from a Navy Exchange.

16:39.466 --> 16:43.070
Now, I've been going over
the local dailies at the casino.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.238
'Scrip matches
a guy you're looking for.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.374
Blue tattoo?
That's right.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.742
There's a good chance

16:49.776 --> 16:52.079
that my armed robber...

16:52.112 --> 16:53.113
may be one in the same
with your murder suspect.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.329
Oh, good,
you got my text.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.664
Did he tell you how concerned
he was about Thanksgiving?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.665
Oh, I'm not worried.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.201
King stuffed a Tofurkey
with Navy rations--

17:14.234 --> 17:16.436
it tasted more
homemade than homemade.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.472
See how much confidence
we all have in you?

17:19.506 --> 17:20.607
Your text?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.575
Let you know I went rogue.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.743
Meaning?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.312
Why should you NCIS agents

17:25.345 --> 17:26.779
have all the fun?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.449
I made a few calls,
found a doctor

17:29.482 --> 17:31.751
who treated a man for Argyria.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.221
Blue tattoo that
wasn't a blue tattoo.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.722
Yes, ma'am, Pride told me.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.225
Turns out the good doctor
treated a patient

17:38.258 --> 17:40.460
while that patient
was serving time in prison.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.795
Ed Tagget.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.332
Arrested 2006 for armed robbery

17:45.365 --> 17:47.100
in Georgia.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.336
Did time from 2007 to 2015.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.338
Explains the ten-year absence.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.572
Loretta, will you let me know

17:52.605 --> 17:54.174
if the coroner's life
gets boring?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.676
We'll set you up
with a desk at our place.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.748
Ten years ago, Lasalle and I
worked our first case together.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.716
Started when three men stole

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
a hundred grand
from a Navy Exchange.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.589
Witness saw a man
with a blue tattoo.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.591
Yeah, we think
that man is Tagget.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.860
He killed Phil Hart,
stole his car.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.430
And tried to use it to escape,
but the storm stopped him.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.332
Found a few bills in the car.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.135
Believe he hid the rest
somewhere in the city.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.770
Now he's back in town to get it.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.505
The question is

18:25.538 --> 18:27.774
why did Tagget think Ford,

18:27.807 --> 18:30.510
pillar of the community,
had that money?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.512
Anything in the boxes
at Ford's house?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.381
SONJA: Nah, Sebastian's
going through them.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.615
There's nothing yet.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.883
I've got something.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.219
Present day victim.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.521
Ford's current post was Algiers.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.224
But ten years ago,
he worked out of Belle Chasse.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.558
Same place the heist happened.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.327
Same timeframe?
Yep.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.162
Worked part-time with
the janitorial service.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.663
Had keys to the Navy Exchange.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.166
So Ford may have been
an inside man.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.434
Helps rob the place,
Katrina hits,

18:54.467 --> 18:55.768
something goes wrong
with the getaway--

18:55.802 --> 18:57.637
he holds onto the money.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.339
Tagget comes back
to look for it.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.707
Yeah, but the guy we chased

19:00.740 --> 19:02.409
out of Ford's residence
was empty-handed.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.943
BRODY: Maybe he hid it
somewhere else.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.778
Or an accomplice has it.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.780
I got this
from the old case file.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.417
It's the parking lot
outside the Exchange.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.652
One could be Tagget,
one Ford and the other

19:12.685 --> 19:13.886
still have the money.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.455
It was no use at the time,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.457
but given the magic
of modern-day Sebastian,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.526
what do you bet we can
get something now?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.893
Call him.

19:20.927 --> 19:24.331
PRIDE:
Sure, baby, I know.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.365
I miss you, too.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.699
Uh-huh.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.270
Put her on.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.339
Just got those from
surveillance.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.674
It looks like
three suspects.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.211
Hey, Laurel.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.880
You did?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.682
That's great.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.917
Well, I'm sending you
hugs, boo.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.486
All right,
tell Mommy I love her.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.455
I love you, too.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.457
That's my wife and kid.
Uh-huh.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.824
Can you enhance this?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.660
Uh, that is enhanced.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.664
Well, I thought you NCIS agents
had all the fancy gadgets.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.433
The money.
This ain't no lead.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.402
You want to go back to your
flooded headquarters,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.771
feel free.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.840
Well, then again,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.442
I might come with you.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
Kind of stuffy in here.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.514
I like a more relaxed,
personable environs.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.749
Detective?

20:16.783 --> 20:17.850
This came for you.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.287
The case?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.454
My father.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.590
No mail going in

20:23.623 --> 20:25.525
or out of New Orleans.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.927
He gets a letter
hand

20:27.960 --> 20:30.430
When he wants to get
a message to someone...

20:30.463 --> 20:32.265
he finds a way.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.366
Don't get along?

20:33.400 --> 20:34.534
You get along with your dad?

20:37.537 --> 20:38.538
Mm...

20:40.440 --> 20:41.841
Pride.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.445
Where?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.847
Thanks.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.784
Might have a lead
on the murder.

20:51.818 --> 20:55.488
Someone has some stolen
bills from the heist.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.694
Mrs. Hart, you used

21:01.728 --> 21:03.796
this stolen money
to buy food.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.432
Any idea where you
got it from?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.866
No.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.336
You carry this kind of money
around with you often?

21:09.369 --> 21:10.670
All the time.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.672
Got diamonds on the soles
of my shoes, too.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.274
Just a question.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.512
We think that these three men

21:19.546 --> 21:21.881
stole a hundred grand

21:21.914 --> 21:25.652
from a Navy Exchange,
and serial numbers match.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.388
So...

21:28.421 --> 21:32.359
maybe you helped them
get out of town or...

21:32.392 --> 21:34.527
they paid you and--

21:34.561 --> 21:37.430
I found it next to my stuff,
outside in the mud.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.566
Just next to it, in the mud?

21:39.599 --> 21:40.933
Yeah, it was stuck to my bag.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.470
You think it came
from someone around here?

21:43.503 --> 21:44.904
I don't know.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.008
Phil was a musician,
right?

21:49.041 --> 21:51.611
Probably doesn't have
a lot of money.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.346
You got a baby coming.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.348
Are you calling my
husband a thief?

21:55.382 --> 21:57.350
Maybe what I saw
the night before the storm

21:57.384 --> 21:59.686
wasn't a carjacking.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.354
All right, Phil got
in an argument

22:01.388 --> 22:03.089
with one of his partners...

22:03.122 --> 22:04.624
and gets shot over the money.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.694
Where's the rest
of it, Billy?

22:07.727 --> 22:10.497
Detective, my whole life is
in that bag right there.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.031
That's it.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.674
All in here?

22:21.708 --> 22:22.509
Yeah.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.646
Hey!

22:26.679 --> 22:28.381
Stop! What does he
think he's doing?

22:29.716 --> 22:30.850
Lasalle...

22:30.883 --> 22:32.885
hey, stop.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.426
We'll be leaving now.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.029
There's something wrong
with you,

22:43.062 --> 22:44.864
'cause what you just did right
there-- that wasn't about

22:44.897 --> 22:46.866
finding money
or solving my husband's murder.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.902
That, there, was about you.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.977
Ms. Hart.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.753
Hey.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.789
That there was bad cop work.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.890
Like someone's gonna issue
a warrant

23:10.923 --> 23:12.058
in the middle of this chaos.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.893
Not about a warrant.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.895
It's about the person in there.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.964
You could have
simply asked,

23:17.997 --> 23:20.132
gotten permission.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.876
Look, it's getting to me, too.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.614
Come on.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.649
Gotta keep working.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.086
Coming?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.825
You know, Michelangelo
used to say of sculpting

23:45.858 --> 23:47.727
that the statue
was already there.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.997
He just had to remove
the pieces around it.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.100
Love to see him take apart
something, pixel by pixel.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.101
Uh-huh.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.235
Whew!

23:56.268 --> 23:58.871
Man, these boxes
from Ford's house stink.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.674
Yeah, it's all the mold--
you get used to it.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.543
You get anything from them?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.612
Not yet, but we're getting
something.

24:05.645 --> 24:08.915
Aspergillosis,
aspergilloma, asthma.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.050
Appreciate the sacrifice,
Michelangelo.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.052
I do what I can.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.429
Lasalle, you okay?

24:25.832 --> 24:28.968
Yeah, sometimes I wonder if I
should have left it all behind.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.172
Started all over
after the storm,

24:33.205 --> 24:35.975
move somewhere else,
like a lot of people did.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.044
Well, I'm glad you stayed.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.112
At least then you could
see this-- check this out.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.817
I wield a mean
digital chisel.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.886
That's Ford and Tagget,
clear as day.
Uh-huh.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.954
LASALLE: What about
the other guy?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.188
Can you zoom in
on his face?

24:49.221 --> 24:51.591
Uh, yeah, one sec.

24:53.125 --> 24:57.697
Oliver Fray--
the witness from the diner.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.731
He played us.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.615
PRIDE:
That's you, Oliver,
clear as day.

25:15.648 --> 25:16.315
You were one of
Tagget's partners

25:16.348 --> 25:18.618
in the heist, ten years ago.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.020
Look, I told you, I don't know
where Tagget is, or the money.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.589
Come on, Frosty,

25:22.622 --> 25:24.691
now, you lied to us
when you were in that freezer.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.693
I lied because Tagget's crazy.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.294
You saw what he did
to those people.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.663
"Those people" have names:

25:31.831 --> 25:33.600
Ellen Hunt...

25:33.633 --> 25:35.602
Todd Calhoun...

25:35.635 --> 25:37.637
Sergeant Ned Ford...

25:37.670 --> 25:38.638
LASALLE:
And Phil Hart.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.039
I don't,

25:40.072 --> 25:41.340
I don't know who that is.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.009
Look, the heist connects you
to Tagget,

25:43.042 --> 25:44.877
which connects you
to the murder,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.312
so you got blood on your hands.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.615
Just tell us
where Tagget's holed up.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.816
I don't know!

25:49.849 --> 25:51.050
I mean, I barely even knew
the man

25:51.083 --> 25:52.852
ten years ago.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.021
He was working for an
out-of-state syndicate.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.723
They hired our crew
to do the heist

25:56.756 --> 25:58.825
because I happened
to have a guy on the inside.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.593
Ford.
Yes.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.128
And after the heist,
we were supposed to meet up

26:02.161 --> 26:03.796
at Ford's place,
but then the storm happened

26:03.830 --> 26:06.799
and we just figured Tagget took
the money and ran.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.367
And you hadn't seen him
in ten years

26:08.400 --> 26:10.069
until he showed up
at the diner?
No.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.671
I mean, he shows up with Ford.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.139
I mean, he's yelling out for me,

26:13.172 --> 26:14.841
he's-- for his money.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.175
Then he starts shooting.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.145
There was blood everywhere.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.681
So I ran,
I hid in the freezer.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.756
How are we supposed
to believe you?

26:30.389 --> 26:32.859
Look...

26:32.892 --> 26:36.829
the storm changed
us-- me and Ford.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.097
I went straight,

26:38.130 --> 26:39.732
I became a cook.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.733
Ford-- h-h-he served

26:40.767 --> 26:44.103
in Iraq, rebuilt neighborhoods.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.706
I mean, that storm was
our salvation.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.078
From Phil Hart's murder?

26:52.111 --> 26:56.649
Oh, God, I told you I don't
know who Phil Hart is.

26:56.683 --> 27:00.720
You know he died on the side
of the road, in the rain...

27:00.753 --> 27:03.022
his wife wailing.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.024
I lost family, too, all right?

27:05.057 --> 27:06.759
I had to find their bodies.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.229
I don't see how
this changes things.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.832
Yeah?

27:12.865 --> 27:15.334
You ever heard of a place
called St. Gabriel?

27:17.436 --> 27:20.773
PRIDE: We're on our way
to get the body now, so...

27:20.807 --> 27:23.142
Sure.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.777
Thanks.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.078
That was the office.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.915
Phil and Billy Hart were
nowhere near the heist.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.082
Your office ran them?

27:30.116 --> 27:31.083
With all the...

27:31.117 --> 27:33.019
High-tech gadgets.

27:33.052 --> 27:36.155
The stolen money is
connected with a murder.

27:36.188 --> 27:40.159
Storm or not...

27:40.192 --> 27:42.128
killer's on the loose.

27:42.161 --> 27:46.065
Then we find Hart's body,
get another lead.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.100
Yeah, let's hope.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.973
My wife would say it's none
of my business, but...

27:54.974 --> 27:56.375
...give me a hint.

27:59.812 --> 28:03.315
It's a airplane ticket
with a note.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.484
"Come home."

28:05.517 --> 28:08.020
Your dad's worried.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.789
Any parent would be,

28:09.822 --> 28:12.258
given everything that's gone on.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.193
Katrina...

28:14.226 --> 28:16.729
Rita...

28:16.763 --> 28:18.731
This isn't about any storms.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.200
When me and my brother
were kids,

28:21.233 --> 28:24.236
I always wanted to be the one
with the badge.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.011
Your father didn't take
too well to that idea?

28:32.044 --> 28:34.981
All he knows is
what he sees on TV:

28:35.014 --> 28:37.216
cops making
bad decisions.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.484
Don't matter.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.053
I knew the first time
I laid eyes on New Orleans,

28:41.087 --> 28:43.122
this'd be the place
I'd make my mark.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.893
By solving cases,
putting the bad guys away.

28:46.926 --> 28:50.362
You make it sound like
that's a bad thing.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.832
It's how you go
about it, son.

28:52.865 --> 28:56.068
That's how you
make your mark.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.204
Looks like we're here.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.179
PRIDE: Where lost souls
come to be found.

29:17.824 --> 29:22.995
Excuse me, I'm looking
for NOPD tag number 513.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.097
Phil Hart's body.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.399
City morgue bodies are mixed in
with everyone else, but...

29:27.433 --> 29:29.135
I can help you look.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.004
Dwayne...?

29:33.272 --> 29:35.107
Loretta.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.143
You are a sight
for sore eyes.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.111
You all right

29:39.145 --> 29:40.312
Look at you.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.448
I'm so glad you're safe.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.816
Linda

29:43.850 --> 29:44.984
They're all good.
All fine.

29:45.017 --> 29:45.985
:
Good.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.420
Detective Lasalle...

29:48.454 --> 29:49.588
this is my good friend

29:49.621 --> 29:50.589
Dr. Loretta Wade.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.959
We know each other
from JPSO.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.596
Phil Hart.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.498
We need his body for evidence.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.502
Well, then,
right this way.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.137
WADE: You still working
out of Algiers?

30:05.171 --> 30:06.372
PRIDE:
I am.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.142
You know, it doesn't
suit you, you know.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.878
So uptight there.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.615
How can I be friendly...

30:16.648 --> 30:17.884
in hell?

30:19.385 --> 30:22.188
What else am I gonna do,
Detective?

30:23.422 --> 30:25.324
A few weeks back,
someone painted

30:25.357 --> 30:28.895
a number on my friend's door.

30:28.928 --> 30:32.064
She liked to knit things.

30:32.098 --> 30:35.167
Make people happy.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.370
So now I volunteer for her.

30:40.372 --> 30:44.610
I want to knit something--
anything--

30:44.643 --> 30:46.612
out of this.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.916
You're a good friend, Loretta.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.317
513. Phil Hart.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.967
It's not him.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.546
I never want to see
anything like that again.

31:22.314 --> 31:23.315
:
Thank you.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.585
Semper Gumby.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.620
Gotta be flexible.

31:30.990 --> 31:35.327
Job's more than just
catching bad guys.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.233
What am I supposed
to tell Billy?

31:41.267 --> 31:44.103
You tell her you'll keep
working the case.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.206
Work the case?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.408
Look around, Agent Pride.
There's nothing to work.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.312
I mean, it's all gone.

31:54.981 --> 31:58.117
How to make something
out of nothing.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.286
Talk to me. What do we know?

32:00.319 --> 32:02.154
Well, I know
I've never had

32:02.188 --> 32:05.291
Ramen noodle stuffing
for Thanksgiving, ever.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.393
The case.
Right.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.262
So, Oliver's going away
for robbery.

32:10.296 --> 32:13.232
Ned would be too
if he was still alive.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.167
We don't have Tagget.
He killed Ford,

32:15.201 --> 32:17.569
two innocent people
at the diner, and Phil Hart.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.438
Well, we know Tagget is still
in town looking for the money.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.073
He thought Ford had it,

32:21.107 --> 32:22.308
but he clearly didn't.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.575
BRODY:
Is it possible

32:23.609 --> 32:25.411
Tagget hid the money
somewhere else?

32:25.444 --> 32:26.712
A guy matching
Tagget's description

32:26.745 --> 32:28.580
was spotted near
Angela and Dauphine.

32:28.614 --> 32:29.648
SONJA: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

32:31.683 --> 32:35.287
Sergeant Ford lived near there
about ten years ago.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.156
8701 Burgundy.

32:37.189 --> 32:40.426
8701? That's the same place
Phil Hart lived ten years ago.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.528
BRODY: Oliver said they
were supposed to meet up

32:42.561 --> 32:44.230
at Ford's apartment
after the heist.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.365
What if Tagget got there
before anyone else did?

32:46.398 --> 32:48.667
Hid the money
in the floorboards, ceilings--

32:48.700 --> 32:51.170
someplace where it'd be safe.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.671
Research former residents,
property management companies.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.306
Chris, you're with me.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.408
Killer's returning
to the scene of the crime.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.144
Let's meet him there.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.685
PRIDE :
Chris...!

33:15.361 --> 33:17.229
House is gone.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.399
Now what?

33:26.072 --> 33:28.374
Work the case.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.408
Right.

33:42.221 --> 33:42.954
Anything on the BOLO?

33:42.988 --> 33:45.157
Checking.
No, nothing so far.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.261
What about the old case?

33:49.295 --> 33:50.762
Any other witnesses?

33:50.796 --> 33:52.164
No, there weren't any.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.066
Sebastian might
have something.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.136
Graphology for the win.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.737
You lost me already, kid.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.239
Oh, uh, handwriting analysis.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.274
Clues into someone's psyche.
Like, Dwayne,

34:02.308 --> 34:05.244
the reason that your O's are
so broad is 'cause you're...

34:05.277 --> 34:06.412
I know what graphology is.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.447
What does it have to do
with our case?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.449
Oh, well, I found lots
of different handwriting

34:10.482 --> 34:12.251
on the boxes from Ford's house.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.154
Basically, all the boxes came
from his old apartment building,

34:15.187 --> 34:17.456
but they weren't all his--
some were from other tenants.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.425
So the apartment's condemned.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.093
Moving company puts
all the stuff

34:21.127 --> 34:22.294
in storage.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.163
Boxes got mixed up.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.198
PRIDE:
Which means...

34:26.232 --> 34:28.267
one of the other tenants
could have the money.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.169
BRODY: Ten years later,
different addresses.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.303
He keeps doing that.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.238
Hmm?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.143
What are you looking for?

34:37.176 --> 34:39.178
An elephant.
Stuffed elephant.

34:39.211 --> 34:41.247
All right, well,
just be careful--
there's a lot of mold there.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.481
You could get
a fungal ball in your...

34:42.514 --> 34:44.283
Where are the boxes
that Tagget opened--

34:44.316 --> 34:45.817
the ones with the fingerprints?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.121
Be the one.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.826
Billy Hart.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.695
Come on, where are you?

34:56.728 --> 34:59.198
And this... was hers.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.233
She couldn't find it
ten years ago

35:01.267 --> 35:03.369
because it got packed up
by accident.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.472
So Ford could've gotten
her stuff and she could've
gotten the money?

35:06.505 --> 35:08.874
Yeah, and if Tagget
opened this box

35:08.907 --> 35:12.911
and saw these pictures,
he could've recognized her.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.182
Pride, I think I know
where he's going.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.217
I don't understand.
The case.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.551
All of our leads
are dried up.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.253
What about my husband's body?

35:21.287 --> 35:22.254
PRIDE: We haven't been
able to locate it,

35:22.288 --> 35:24.223
but we're gonna keep looking.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.324
Why do you keep
telling her that?

35:25.357 --> 35:27.359
Detective... wait outside.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.328
Look, it's not our job anymore.
Detective,

35:29.361 --> 35:31.263
I said to wait out...
So you're just giving up?

35:31.297 --> 35:32.598
Dwayne "King" Pride and I
have used up

35:32.631 --> 35:34.400
all our resources, okay?

35:34.433 --> 35:36.268
We're never
gonna find him.
Hey, you're done!

35:36.302 --> 35:38.270
Now, outside! Now!
Leave!

35:38.304 --> 35:40.306
PRIDE: You talk that way
to all women?

35:40.339 --> 35:43.209
Or just grieving widows?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.943
After you settle down,

35:44.976 --> 35:46.845
you're gonna go back in there
and you're gonna apologize.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.447
There's no fixing this.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.684
I can't undo what I just did.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.487
I'm through. I'm...
I got to get out of here.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.588
And go where?

35:56.622 --> 35:58.390
I'm gonna go back to 'Bama.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.626
Back to... normalcy.
Okay.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.495
Okay, maybe you should go,
but if you stay...

36:03.529 --> 36:05.697
this case,
it'll come around again.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.433
You're gonna have
a chance to solve it...

36:07.466 --> 36:10.336
and help that woman in there.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.537
That's for you.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.439
I failed.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.675
All right? I can't...
I can't do it. I'm leaving.

36:16.708 --> 36:20.479
BILLY: Help! Somebody!
I need... help!

36:21.880 --> 36:23.949
The baby's coming.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.352
All right, all right,
let's get you to a hospital.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.487
No, no!
It's coming right now!

36:28.520 --> 36:30.356
All right, all right,
we're gonna help you.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.423
What?

36:31.457 --> 36:32.624
Right over here.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.393
All right? Easy, easy.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.296
Here we go. Easy. There you go,
there you go. Good. Good.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.399
All right...
see if you can get me

36:40.432 --> 36:42.334
some clean towels,
and boil some water.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.435
Easy.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.804
All right,
get another pillow.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.641
And find out
if there's a doctor.

36:49.675 --> 36:50.942
Look for a doctor.
Hey, give me that.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.544
Give me that.
I need my elephant!

36:52.578 --> 36:53.979
Your what?
In my bag...

36:54.012 --> 36:55.414
should be a...
a stuffed elephant.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.748
Okay.
Or I can't do this...

36:59.351 --> 37:00.952
All right.
It was Phil's
when he was a kid.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.289
Something to
hold on to

37:03.322 --> 37:04.923
in case I wasn't with him.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.493
:
Oh... oh, I can't do this.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.328
Yes, yes, you can.
You can.

37:09.361 --> 37:12.464
I can't do this
without him.
You can. Just breathe.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.665
I can't find it.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.733
All right, then hold her hand.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.435
All right, just slow, easy.

37:16.468 --> 37:17.436
That's it, that's it.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.470
You're doing good.

37:18.504 --> 37:19.438
Don't you let go.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.606
I won't.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.474
You're gonna be okay.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.410
We're all gonna
do this together.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.945
That's right.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.448
Okay...

37:41.860 --> 37:43.862
Hey.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.698
Hey.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.538
Sorry to bother you,

37:52.571 --> 37:55.441
but I think your kid
left this at the park.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.676
Mine picked it up
accidentally.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.485
(low, indistinct
conversation)

38:06.518 --> 38:08.720
:
I got eyes on Tagget--

38:08.754 --> 38:09.555
behind the door.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.390
Gun on the girls.

38:11.423 --> 38:14.326
PRIDE :
On your signal, Chris.

38:15.994 --> 38:19.331
Sorry, that's... not ours.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.939
Here you go.

38:27.973 --> 38:28.940
You should have this.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.411
Now!

38:33.078 --> 38:34.413
LASALLE: Come on!

38:43.522 --> 38:44.723
NCIS, Tagget!

38:44.756 --> 38:45.691
It's over.

38:47.092 --> 38:47.893
Put your gun down.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.396
Hands where
we can see 'em-- easy!

38:50.429 --> 38:51.830
I ain't leavin'
without my money!

38:51.863 --> 38:55.601
LASALLE: There's nowhere to run!
Give yourself up!

38:57.769 --> 39:00.572
Drop your weapon.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.590
LASALLE:
Agent Pride,

39:18.624 --> 39:20.559
we just cleared our
first case together.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.529
Better late than never.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.464
I'll make sure
the Navy gets this.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.435
LASALLE:
How they doing?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.737
Shaken up,
but they'll be okay.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.572
Billy didn't even know
she had the money.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.541
Never opened the boxes.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.543
Didn't want
to unearth the past.

39:37.576 --> 39:38.877
LASALLE:
Maybe she finds

39:38.910 --> 39:41.480
a little peace from this.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.519
PRIDE:
That sounds like a plan.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.521
All right.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.561
That what I think it is?

39:55.594 --> 39:57.629
My out.

39:57.663 --> 39:59.130
My escape.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.932
My exit plan.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.770
If things don't work out here,
you can always go back home.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.141
I am home.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.143
Whew!

40:12.177 --> 40:13.979
And I'm hungry.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.448
Let's go eat.

40:17.649 --> 40:18.950
Commander's Palace?

40:18.984 --> 40:20.185
Even better.

40:23.689 --> 40:26.057
Hey! Here we go.
Where are the boys?

40:26.091 --> 40:27.626
CJ and Danny
are coming soon.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.160
Help out.
Yes, ma'am.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.463
WADE :
They are baking an apple pie

40:31.497 --> 40:32.664
from scratch.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.600
Just hope my kitchen's
still standing.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.302
Heard from Patton.
He just landed.

40:37.335 --> 40:40.539
I thought he was spending
the holiday on Miami Beach.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.973
He was, until he heard
who was cooking tonight...

40:42.007 --> 40:44.242
decided to cut
his vacation short.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.977
Anybody hungry?
PRIDE: Hey!

40:46.011 --> 40:47.078
(everyone laughs
and exclaims happily)

40:47.112 --> 40:49.548
There he is! Thank you so much
for coming, Donald.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.717
Anything for family, King.
How are you, Loretta?

40:51.750 --> 40:55.020
Mr. Link,
what is that divine smell?

40:55.053 --> 40:57.188
LINK: That would be
my grandma's dressing.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.025
Hey, uh, Pride, this sure beats
ramen noodles, right?

41:00.058 --> 41:01.993
SEBASTIAN: All right,
hold on, hold on.

41:02.027 --> 41:04.029
Thanksgiving's
not about the food, okay?

41:04.062 --> 41:06.598
It's about the amount of food
that you stuff in your face.

41:06.632 --> 41:07.933
SONJA: All right.
Whatever.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.701
And the company you keep.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.672
Glad you guys could make it.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.206
Thanks for the invitation.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.676
And for everything
you've done for us.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.745
It's my job.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.947
Lisa...

41:21.980 --> 41:25.551
this is NCIS Agent Lasalle.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.686
He's one of the good guys.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.287
Nice to meet you.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.722
Nice to meet you, too.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.764
*

41:56.715 --> 41:59.217
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

41:59.250 --> 42:02.053
* Hey, pocky-a-way

42:02.087 --> 42:04.590
* Hey, hey, hey, yeah

42:04.623 --> 42:06.692
* Hey, pocky-a-way

42:09.227 --> 42:10.729
* Do it to ya!

42:13.765 --> 42:14.766
*
