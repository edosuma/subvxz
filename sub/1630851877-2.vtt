WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:09.968
HE DESERVES TO DIE, SO KILL HIM

00:10.051 --> 00:12.262
I KILLED HIM LIKE YOU SAID
BECAUSE HE DESERVED IT

00:12.345 --> 00:13.430
KILL HIM!

00:13.513 --> 00:14.514
SAVE HIM?

00:16.349 --> 00:17.350
OVERLY SUSPICIOUS
EVIDENCE, <i>HIKIKOMORI</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:18.518
I DO AS I PLEASE?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.522
MY GOSH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

00:25.025 --> 00:25.859
CURIOUS?

00:25.942 --> 00:26.985
THEY ALL DIED!

00:29.863 --> 00:31.197
A HUSBAND-KILLER?
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

00:31.281 --> 00:32.240
SOMETHING IS FISHY

00:34.868 --> 00:35.702
MUST WE ALL LIVE?

00:35.785 --> 00:36.619
WE MUST

00:37.370 --> 00:39.164
A NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN INSPECTOR

00:46.671 --> 00:49.257
Hansel, I don't feel good about this!

00:50.133 --> 00:52.343
Gretel, stay calm.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.681
Gretel, stay calm.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.893
What is that glistening in the dark?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.898
What is that glistening in the dark?

01:05.774 --> 01:09.527
That cottage is made of tasty snacks.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.655
That cottage

01:13.740 --> 01:16.409
is made of tasty snacks.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.912
<i>Come here. Let's go inside.</i>

01:18.995 --> 01:20.538
EPISODE 2

01:21.039 --> 01:22.082
Come here.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.669
Damn it. Do I have to go in there?

01:26.753 --> 01:27.879
Let's go inside.

02:16.845 --> 02:17.971
Mr. Kim!

03:20.658 --> 03:21.618
One…

03:22.577 --> 03:24.537
two, three!

03:52.941 --> 03:55.526
TONGYEONG SAVER

04:41.322 --> 04:42.490
DO NOT CROSS

04:42.573 --> 04:45.576
Je-hui, I'm afraid
you should come down here too.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.745
This is bigger than I thought.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.252
Hey…

04:54.335 --> 04:57.046
<i>A man in his thirties who disappeared
and was declared dead</i>

04:57.130 --> 04:59.340
<i>was pronounced dead for the second time.</i>

04:59.841 --> 05:03.469
<i>The police believe when he was caught
faking his death for an insurance payout,</i>

05:03.553 --> 05:06.973
<i>he fled inside the sewers and died</i>

05:07.056 --> 05:09.434
<i>after inhaling poisonous gas.</i>

05:09.517 --> 05:12.520
<i>An insurance inspector,
who had come to assess the situation,</i>

05:12.603 --> 05:14.731
<i>was the first to find his body.</i>

05:14.814 --> 05:17.567
<i>The police are being criticized
for failing to carry out</i>

05:17.650 --> 05:21.112
<i>a thorough investigation
during his initial disappearance.</i>

05:21.696 --> 05:23.656
<i>Next up is the weather forecast.</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:26.826
<i>Here is the weather forecast.
Due to the clear weather…</i>

05:26.909 --> 05:29.162
-I need water…
-My goodness.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.622
<i>The weather is cool,
and the fine dust level is low.</i>

05:31.706 --> 05:32.999
I didn't even know you came.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.334
<i>The wonderful weather…</i>

05:34.417 --> 05:38.296
I was watching something frightening
on the news and you scared me to death.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.965
-<i>Under the blue sky…</i>
-Oh, dear.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.259
Goodness. Look at you sweating.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.802
My gosh.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.638
Gosh, I shouldn't have told you to come.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.266
-I shouldn't have.
-It's okay, ma'am.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.893
I'm loving the fresh air.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.978
Did you see that?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.273
I remember you saying

05:57.356 --> 06:01.694
that he was certainly dead
seeing how they couldn't find him.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.945
Yes.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.448
But he revealed himself and ended up dead.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.367
You're right. It's baffling.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.828
Did you look into her?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.289
Yes. She's a former police officer.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.876
She works as an investigator
for NT Life Insurance from time to time.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.544
What time was she born?

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962
Hold on…

06:21.297 --> 06:22.507
Between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.092
That's great.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.678
That's fire. I get along well
with people like her.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.557
I think we should be cautious
so that there won't be any issues.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.728
Mr. Kim, I can't even sleep at night
because I'm terrified.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.980
Isn't this horrendous?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.608
How is this happening?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.693
I'll try to take care of it.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.494
<i>This is a letter to you.</i>

06:54.080 --> 06:55.623
<i>There are kids in need.</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:58.209
<i>Please protect them</i>

06:58.960 --> 07:00.545
<i>and look after them.</i>

07:02.421 --> 07:04.298
<i>They need your support.</i>

07:04.382 --> 07:05.633
<i>Pureun Children's Foundation.</i>

07:05.716 --> 07:07.385
<i>I'm Heo Hyeon-tae,
the honorary ambassador.</i>

07:07.468 --> 07:10.304
Goodness, look at that boy.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.684
That boy, Hyeon-tae, is
my only joy in life.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.897
He's one adorable boy.

07:23.317 --> 07:24.652
Don't you agree?

07:24.735 --> 07:25.862
Yes, ma'am.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.657
It looks scrumptious.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.372
Got you!

08:19.290 --> 08:21.250
Where have you been?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.920
Please respect your niece's privacy.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.131
Why did you sleep here, not at your place?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.425
As your aunt,
I can come here whenever I want.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.596
But, tell me.

08:33.679 --> 08:38.226
Where were you all night
with your phone off?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.063
I'm not a kid.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.399
I'm hungry. Did you have breakfast yet?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.904
Did you have a nightmare again?

08:49.987 --> 08:52.323
You should've called me right away.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.201
I was drinking with my colleagues.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.204
Then I got drunk,
so I stayed at a nearby cafe to sober up.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.330
Happy?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.290
I see.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.589
No wonder you smell musty.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.550
Is it bad?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.635
Go take a shower. You reek.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.720
Should we have sausage stew?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.265
-With beans, butter, and rice?
-Sounds good!

09:17.348 --> 09:18.391
Sounds good!

09:38.744 --> 09:39.829
Right.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.165
All right.

09:56.929 --> 09:57.972
What's wrong?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.726
Oh, it's nothing.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.841
JOB SHADOW DAY

10:33.924 --> 10:34.967
No way.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.136
Unbelievable.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.225
Had it truly been an accident,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.686
the container wouldn't have been
set on fire.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.815
Someone did it on purpose
for Yoon Jae-yeong.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.780
Something's fishy.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.121
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

11:09.126 --> 11:13.422
They waited for a witness
to be Yoon Jae-yeong's alibi,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.466
and even got rid of the evidence.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.426
But who?

11:17.510 --> 11:21.555
She wasn't seeing anyone
and didn't have other family members.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.768
Over the past two years, workers
from the plant Min-gyu worked at…

11:25.851 --> 11:28.145
They all died.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.023
They fished out
a dead body from the breakwater.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.693
<i>It was someone who died while doing
chores for the people on the boat.</i>

11:34.777 --> 11:37.822
They say that he held a grudge
against them and cursed them,

11:37.905 --> 11:39.990
which is why everyone on the boat died.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.034
Let's see.

11:42.118 --> 11:46.288
One of them died in a car accident.
One of them died of a heart attack.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.290
<i>Come on.</i>

11:48.374 --> 11:49.959
Instead of helping Yoon Jae-yeong,

11:50.042 --> 11:52.795
what if the killer
just wanted to murder those people?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.339
This is a police station, you know?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.969
How much investigation
did you do on the Hyochang Bio people?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.262
Why do you ask?

12:01.345 --> 12:03.305
I'm too busy working on this case.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.726
I heard those who died, including
Kim Min-gyu, had been at the party.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.105
Everyone knows already.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.567
Come on. Do you seriously believe
everything they gossip about?

12:14.650 --> 12:18.404
Look at what happened.
Everyone who was there ended up dying.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.656
-It's not true.
-Did you even look into it?

12:20.739 --> 12:24.201
Look here. Tongyeong may seem
like a small town, but it's not.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.828
Coincidences can happen.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.331
Han Man-gu and his mistress
died in a car crash.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.168
The other one struggled
to make ends meet and hanged herself.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.254
And Kim Min-gyu was
just after the insurance payout.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.215
He died after hiding in the sewers
and inhaling poisonous gas.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.509
So what is there left to investigate?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.387
Then what about that kid?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.182
Lee Jun-hyeon.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.352
So you do know.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.731
That boy who died on the boat
during the company dinner.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.399
-Poor thing. Gosh.
-What happened?

12:56.066 --> 12:57.026
He died alone.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.569
The security camera is broken?

12:58.652 --> 13:01.280
Yes, sir. And no one saw anything.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.496
You were in charge of that case, right?

13:08.579 --> 13:11.165
You must've heard
some ridiculous rumors again.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.209
He has nothing to do with this!

13:13.292 --> 13:17.087
He was a troublemaker who was
in and out of youth reformatories.

13:17.171 --> 13:21.008
But as you know, he'd often
roam around the quay drunk.

13:27.139 --> 13:32.144
He must've lost his footing or something
by the quay and drowned.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.317
Something's fishy.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.905
Ma'am, we're not done here.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.492
I'm just a witness.
I can leave whenever I want.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.791
Ma'am, that's the wrong way.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.047
Gosh, I can't think.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.718
What should you do when you're stuck?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.512
BAIGAN LIQUOR

14:18.566 --> 14:21.402
This makes it taste like whiskey.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.495
Want some?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.331
Just one sip.

14:34.915 --> 14:35.791
Come on.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.309
He doesn't know what he's missing.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.936
Have a glass and tell me

14:56.478 --> 14:59.857
who did this to you.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.909
THE LATE LEE JUN-HYEON

15:15.039 --> 15:18.959
His landlord has kept his belongings,
but there's nothing special.

15:19.043 --> 15:23.756
His rent had been overdue so they
kept asking me to pay them instead.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.382
Here's his phone.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.598
GYU-JIN, CAN YOU LEND ME 20,000 WON?

15:32.681 --> 15:36.644
I'M SORRY, JIN-SEOK. PLEASE HELP ME OUT.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.106
GALLERY

15:49.031 --> 15:51.283
<i>He didn't have friends or family,</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:54.078
which means no one would have
the motive to avenge his death.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.454
<i>He was like me.</i>

15:56.163 --> 15:57.039
Ms. Na.

15:57.831 --> 15:58.749
What?

15:58.832 --> 16:00.918
Someone lit a candle for him.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.544
THE LATE LEE JUN-HYEON

16:07.508 --> 16:09.551
PLEASE WRITE YOUR NAME DOWN
BEFORE LIGHTING A CANDLE

16:10.719 --> 16:11.679
Here he is.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.683
LEE JUN-HYEON

16:17.309 --> 16:19.728
YOON JAE-YEONG

16:27.653 --> 16:31.323
If I report this to the police,
you won't be able to receive the payout.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.034
You need look after Seon-mi safe,
don't you?

16:46.672 --> 16:50.509
Did you tell the police
that you knew nothing?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.055
Seon-mi.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.684
It's okay. Why don't you
play outside for a while?

16:59.226 --> 17:01.478
Would you like to do that?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.872
Is that why you're here?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.250
When I just buried my husband?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.797
He has a knack for things like that.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.927
Unlike someone.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.180
You got me totally fooled.

17:36.263 --> 17:40.726
So tell me. When your husband made
a foolish suggestion that he should

17:40.809 --> 17:44.605
sacrifice himself for Seon-mi's
hospital bills, were you moved?

17:44.688 --> 17:45.731
No.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.650
At first, I said it was ludicrous.

17:53.697 --> 17:55.491
Don't be ludicrous.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.750
-Sir.
-Oh, no.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.168
Goodness.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.003
-He passed away.
-Poor him.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.755
I hadn't seen him for a while.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.715
-Who knew?
-Oh, dear.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.384
-Goodness.
-Poor him.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.929
-Seriously.
-Oh, dear.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.139
-What are we to do?
-My gosh.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.808
<i>He said if we held out for a year,</i>

18:20.891 --> 18:24.853
we'd be able to leave this place
and live happily ever after.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.981
He had planned it all.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.318
And you were so close to succeeding.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.529
But he put his desires first

18:33.612 --> 18:36.240
and ruined everything
by revealing himself.

18:36.323 --> 18:40.577
You must've thought
he was better off dead, right?

18:42.788 --> 18:43.997
That's understandable.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.208
But only a meticulous person

18:46.291 --> 18:48.502
could've filled up the shelter
with poisonous gas

18:48.585 --> 18:50.838
and gotten rid of the evidence
by setting a fire.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.674
And that's not you.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.551
You're right.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.554
I didn't do anything.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.847
Then who was it?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.265
What do you mean?

19:01.348 --> 19:03.976
Someone helped you kill him.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.310
Who was it?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.818
They told you about Lee Jun-hyeon,
didn't they?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.071
Did you contact them first,

19:16.155 --> 19:19.992
saying your husband is a scumbag who put
his sexual desires before his daughter,

19:21.034 --> 19:24.246
and also that he was
an accessory to murder?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.248
Did you ask them to kill him?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.292
I never asked them to kill him.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.380
Seon-mi!

19:35.924 --> 19:38.093
It's a dolphin.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.056
I'll keep it a secret.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.643
I'll keep your family safe.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.273
Someone contacted me out of the blue.

19:53.817 --> 19:54.818
Hello?

19:54.902 --> 19:57.946
Your husband's cell phone was turned on
for a moment yesterday.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.740
I called in case he called you.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.117
His phone was turned on?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.954
It could've just been stolen,
so don't get your hopes up.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.089
MIRONET
NEW MESSAGE

20:21.011 --> 20:22.304
<i>I have to take it off first.</i>

20:24.514 --> 20:25.599
<i>Let's do it.</i>

20:57.464 --> 20:58.757
I already read these.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.009
Hey! Damn it!

21:03.095 --> 21:03.929
Are you crazy?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.473
Don't you think I know
what you did with your phone on?

21:06.556 --> 21:10.018
What if you get caught?
What'll happen to our daughter?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.186
Let go!

21:12.646 --> 21:13.647
Damn it.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.858
Damn it.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.038
RESTRICTED NUMBER

21:31.331 --> 21:32.332
Hello?

21:35.836 --> 21:38.588
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

21:39.172 --> 21:40.841
They refused to answer me.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.801
But they asked me

21:44.094 --> 21:46.096
if I knew a man named Lee Jun-hyeon

21:46.805 --> 21:49.891
and what happened
during my husband's company dinner.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.226
They told me

21:53.145 --> 21:55.731
not to feel too guilty
even if my husband died.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.400
<i>I'll call you again soon.</i>

21:58.483 --> 22:01.445
<i>And I expect you to help me out then.</i>

22:09.119 --> 22:10.620
That was it?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.791
I had no idea this would happen.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.545
He was still Seon-mi's dad.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.133
And they prepared that shelter too?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.764
So you just did as you were told.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.562
If anyone spots you,

22:35.645 --> 22:37.689
run away and follow this mark.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.316
You'll find a shelter.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.538
I had no idea this would happen.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.040
Yes, you did.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.834
Kill him.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.672
He deserves it.

23:02.756 --> 23:06.426
You wanted him dead,
and your wish was granted.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.054
So why are you feigning sadness?

23:12.766 --> 23:14.017
What do you know?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.394
The person I trusted the most

23:16.478 --> 23:19.231
turned out to be someone
completely different.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.149
Do you know how it feels to realize

23:21.233 --> 23:23.527
that your entire life was a lie?

23:25.195 --> 23:26.571
I just don't know…

23:28.573 --> 23:30.200
who you are anymore.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.289
Why should I care?

24:07.988 --> 24:09.030
Help me!

24:11.867 --> 24:14.202
-Why did he fall in there?
-Do something, will you?

24:14.286 --> 24:16.037
Hold on. Is there a ring buoy nearby?

24:16.621 --> 24:18.373
-Help me!
-Do something.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.542
-Gosh.
-Watch out.

24:24.462 --> 24:25.589
Is he…

24:28.842 --> 24:30.177
Die, all of you.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.843
<i>Who could've done this?</i>

25:57.264 --> 25:59.266
Don't go!

25:59.349 --> 26:02.602
That's the witch's house!

26:04.312 --> 26:08.233
The witch lives there!

26:23.373 --> 26:24.791
-You were great.
-Eat up.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.251
-We did well.
-Right?

26:26.334 --> 26:27.502
Good work.

26:27.585 --> 26:28.962
I wanted to help you myself.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.550
-Eat up.
-Thank you for the meal.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.343
-Enjoy.
-You too.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.220
-Was it good?
-We didn't seem like rookies.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.267
-It's tasty.
-It is.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.936
It was a success.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.354
-Really?
-You surprised me.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.940
This is so delicious, right?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.068
Hey. Good work, Yi-kyung.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.323
How was my acting?
I rehearsed a lot for today.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.658
Well…

26:59.409 --> 27:00.410
Yi-kyung.

27:00.493 --> 27:04.080
I hope you won't be offended
by what I'm about to say.

27:05.832 --> 27:08.626
I'd like you to take care
of the lighting next time.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.005
No way.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.970
Has the next performance
already been scheduled?

27:21.222 --> 27:22.682
I'm fine with anything.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.809
But I do prefer acting.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.228
-You see--
-Would you like more pizza?

27:29.689 --> 27:32.650
This meal is on me,

27:32.734 --> 27:35.320
so order anything you want!

28:34.838 --> 28:35.797
Thief!

28:38.508 --> 28:39.551
Who are you?

28:42.637 --> 28:44.556
You're not allowed in here.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.020
Are you drinking again?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.774
One celebratory drink?

29:00.905 --> 29:03.575
Did you have something tasty without me?

29:03.658 --> 29:04.909
Take a guess.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.374
Gosh, you…

29:14.627 --> 29:16.671
No way. Incredible.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.007
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.971
This water tastes good.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
Was it on the news?

29:28.641 --> 29:30.518
They concluded it was an accident.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.817
It's all thanks to my support.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.779
And yet, you always go out
and have tasty food without me.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.655
How could you have pizza without me?

29:44.699 --> 29:47.744
I can't believe this day has come.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.206
There's no evidence.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.084
There was a witness,

29:55.877 --> 29:57.921
and that woman has a strong alibi.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.760
All I did was set the tables

30:03.843 --> 30:07.514
and enjoy the feast before me.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.600
There were no problems, right?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.069
Do you remember Jang Seong-u?

30:21.152 --> 30:24.030
The teacher who was in charge
of our high school drama club.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.032
-His wife was a police officer.
-Right.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.034
He committed suicide, right?

30:29.285 --> 30:31.871
Really? Mr. Jang killed himself?

30:31.955 --> 30:34.457
I had left the neighborhood,
so I'm not too sure.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.750
But I heard so. Why?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.545
His wife is an insurance inspector now.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.381
She's the witness.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.216
If she digs too deep,

30:43.883 --> 30:45.385
just kill her too.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.514
Why?

30:49.597 --> 30:51.975
-Did she do something wrong?
-No.

30:52.767 --> 30:53.852
Just because.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.646
I just don't like it that she was a cop.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.483
That's no reason to be killing someone.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.695
But that's what you used to do.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.196
Me?

31:06.155 --> 31:07.240
When did I do that?

31:07.323 --> 31:09.951
Enough with your terrible acting.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.911
Let's just clean up.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.671
JUN-HYEON FROM THE REFORMATORY

31:21.754 --> 31:24.507
IT'S ME, JUN-HYEON. I MISS YOU.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.352
Isn't there anyone else?

31:37.186 --> 31:38.479
DELETE CONTACT

31:39.647 --> 31:40.648
What?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.361
To kill, I mean.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.464
<i>Kill them all!</i>

32:46.547 --> 32:48.257
<i>What are you doing?</i>

32:51.636 --> 32:54.597
<i>Damn it. Can we at least win this game?</i>

32:57.976 --> 32:59.727
<i>This is to cheer you up.</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:01.771
<i>It's not over
just because we lost a match.</i>

33:01.854 --> 33:02.897
<i>Let's go.</i>

33:03.606 --> 33:06.192
Gosh, I can't think properly.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.367
Hold on.

33:14.450 --> 33:17.078
<i>Are you leaving? Don't go.</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:13.092
What is it?

34:13.176 --> 34:15.011
What's wrong? Why are you on the floor?

34:21.684 --> 34:22.685
Gosh.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.946
I think I'm getting fired.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.120
Kim Min-gyu's family
was given 600 million won.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.414
It was cut down due to the false report,

34:43.498 --> 34:45.958
but we still had to pay them that much.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.377
And it will all be reflected
on my performance evaluation.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.796
So what?

34:49.879 --> 34:51.005
What do you mean?

34:51.089 --> 34:54.675
Inspection Team B will be disbanded.
Do you know what that means?

35:11.484 --> 35:15.196
I'll be sacked
because you failed to make it a suicide.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.326
That means it's the end
for your computer, your beer,

35:21.035 --> 35:24.163
and the team
that I've been leading. Everything.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.060
You always yearn to be acknowledged.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.479
But you know what?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.148
That's not it. I only expect--

35:50.231 --> 35:51.732
It's a homicide.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.111
The landslide,
the source of the hydrogen sulfide,

35:55.194 --> 35:56.529
the fire at the container,

35:56.612 --> 35:59.282
and the tip-off given to Yoon Jae-yeong.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.284
-Did you look into them?
-Kyung-yi.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.035
Kyung-yi!

36:03.119 --> 36:05.955
This isn't the National Police Agency,
and you're not a cop anymore.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.457
Something's fishy.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.294
The landslide happened naturally.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.379
As for the hydrogen sulfide,

36:13.462 --> 36:16.048
you do know that place
was connected to the sewers, right?

36:16.132 --> 36:18.259
And the fire happened
due to a short circuit,

36:18.342 --> 36:20.052
you dubious woman.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.846
That's why it's more terrifying.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.265
People died,

36:24.348 --> 36:27.226
but wasn't even investigated because
it was made to look like an accident.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.477
Let's say you're right.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.606
Then how did they know
that Kim Min-gyu was alive?

36:31.689 --> 36:33.691
They were killing them off one by one.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.068
It was his turn,
but he was nowhere to be seen.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.613
Not even his body.

36:38.696 --> 36:43.492
Then they must've seen his wife
going in and out of the woods.

36:43.576 --> 36:48.247
They had no idea when he'd reveal himself,
so how did they know when to poison him?

36:48.331 --> 36:49.874
That's where I come in.

36:50.666 --> 36:53.002
They did this after seeing me
approach him.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.253
Let me get this straight.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.714
They had it all planned out to kill him.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.799
But they patiently waited

36:58.883 --> 37:02.178
for someone like you
to appear before killing him?

37:02.261 --> 37:03.179
Is that it?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.267
Aren't they just incredible?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.647
They planned it all out
so perfectly to kill him.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.067
Your eyes are sparkling.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.778
I haven't seen you like this
in five years.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.322
Kyung-yi.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.951
Do you remember telling me to stop you
whenever you started suspecting things?

37:41.968 --> 37:45.263
I won't let you suspect everything
and waste your life again.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.765
This is important.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.603
I'm back.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.146
I have no time to say hi.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.357
I'm resurrecting now.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.243
Did you say goodbye to your friends?

38:09.704 --> 38:13.457
No. Why go through that hassle
when we won't see each other again?

38:15.543 --> 38:18.462
And I don't want us
to say our farewells and bawl.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.965
Are you worried about moving schools?

38:21.048 --> 38:22.591
I wanted to go myself.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.720
Right. You'll be fine.
You always put in your best effort.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.723
But don't try too hard.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.477
I don't think that's something
a teacher should be telling me.

38:34.770 --> 38:38.107
It seems that you always try too hard.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.944
I can see that when you're acting
or when you're with your friends.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.991
I get the feeling
that this is about Yeong-ju,

38:47.074 --> 38:48.159
but I'm fine.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.869
I know you're frustrated.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.830
You feel like no one can understand you.

38:52.913 --> 38:55.249
I'm just asking you to give them a chance.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.794
Then you'll find at least one person.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.546
Someone who'll understand me?

39:01.380 --> 39:02.631
No, not that.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.510
But you'll find someone
who'll make you feel comfortable.

39:07.219 --> 39:09.347
Is your wife like that to you?

39:09.889 --> 39:11.098
It didn't seem like it.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.310
Gosh, you have a keen eye.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.480
Koo Kyung-yi and I…

39:19.231 --> 39:20.858
are complete opposites.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.151
Koo Kyung-yi?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.862
That's her name?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.740
Wait. You're Yi-kyung,

39:27.823 --> 39:30.034
and my wife's name is the same,
except backwards.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.788
Anyway, goodbye.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.748
I hope to see you again.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.423
And he killed himself?

39:48.094 --> 39:50.179
Yeong-ju!

39:50.262 --> 39:52.890
Yeong-ju, over here!

39:54.100 --> 39:55.142
Hi!

39:58.145 --> 40:00.606
You're already attending
teaching practice.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.024
You're all grown up now.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.735
I'm so proud of you, Yeong-ju.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.242
We were so close back then, right?

40:11.867 --> 40:13.577
You didn't even pick up.

40:14.161 --> 40:17.206
-Did you change your number?
-Yes, I did.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.171
So you want to know
what happened to Mr. Jang?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.881
Yes. Tell me.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.217
Do you remember Han-gyeol?

40:28.300 --> 40:30.803
Of course. She played Ophelia.
She had very fair skin.

40:30.886 --> 40:34.140
Did you know she drowned in a reservoir?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.307
No way.

40:36.684 --> 40:37.726
Was she murdered?

40:37.810 --> 40:42.356
The police said she'd slipped
and fallen into the water,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.400
but no one believed them.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.985
On the day of her death,

40:46.068 --> 40:48.946
someone saw her with Mr. Jang alone.

40:49.029 --> 40:52.825
And there were rumors
that the two were secretly dating.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.120
-But his wife was--
-A police officer, right?

40:56.203 --> 40:59.290
Right. So rumor had it
that his wife helped him

40:59.373 --> 41:02.042
disguise her death as an accident.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.504
Mr. Jang was completely humiliated.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.383
And then he committed suicide.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.677
Did he leave a letter?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.637
I don't think so.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.514
Did he really kill her?

41:15.598 --> 41:19.101
No one knows. Both of them are dead,
and there's no evidence.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.896
Before his wife quit her job,

41:22.480 --> 41:24.273
she was poking around everywhere.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.442
She wanted to prove his innocence.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.528
But she couldn't find any evidence.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.408
But she might've wanted to find
the evidence that he was indeed guilty.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.163
Jeez.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.999
Maybe he did something gross to Han-gyeol.

41:44.376 --> 41:47.713
Someone should've killed him
before he could take his own life.

41:48.839 --> 41:49.924
Don't you think so?

41:50.424 --> 41:53.052
Why should he get to live
when Han-gyeol's dead?

41:53.135 --> 41:55.012
Why should he get to live
when those cats died?

41:58.057 --> 41:59.725
Can I go now?

41:59.808 --> 42:02.603
Come on. We just met.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.022
Let's chat and go do karaoke.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.732
Give me your number.

42:07.316 --> 42:09.944
I don't think
we're close enough to exchange numbers.

42:10.027 --> 42:13.197
What? Aren't we close friends?

42:19.828 --> 42:22.206
Do you still think it was me?

42:22.790 --> 42:24.833
Maybe Roy repaid your kindness.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.215
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

42:39.306 --> 42:41.600
Leave me alone. Please!

42:41.684 --> 42:42.893
What's wrong?

42:42.977 --> 42:44.228
I beg you.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.480
Please. I'm sorry.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.482
I'm so scared!

42:48.566 --> 42:49.942
What's wrong?

42:52.361 --> 42:56.949
I'm sorry for everything! I really am!

That's strange. It's already paid for.

You want to kill yourself?

46:22.738 --> 46:23.572
What?

46:23.655 --> 46:26.033
Because you were abused by your parents,
have a gambling addiction,

46:26.116 --> 46:28.994
and a loan that you can't pay back
under your sister's name?

46:29.077 --> 46:30.245

-Give that back.
-What?

46:53.936 --> 46:55.354
Give it back.

46:55.437 --> 46:57.856
You'd also want to die

Tell me one reason why I shouldn't die.

47:00.776 --> 47:01.985

47:10.160 --> 47:13.664
Let's see. What else? What should I say?

47:16.917 --> 47:19.211
The fact that
you can't answer me right away

47:19.294 --> 47:21.255
means I have no reason to live.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.048
Why did you come?

47:23.674 --> 47:25.842
Just let me die!

-No.

Just go! Let me die!

You're right.

We don't have a reason to live.

48:09.761 --> 48:10.762
What?

48:11.972 --> 48:14.141
Think about it. You're right.

48:15.934 --> 48:17.769
What's the point of living?

48:19.771 --> 48:22.733
You see, I used to be a police officer.

48:22.816 --> 48:25.319
I suspected my own husband
and ended up killing him.

48:26.194 --> 48:27.404
What's funnier is

48:27.487 --> 48:30.574
that I'm still curious
whether he was the real culprit or not.

48:33.702 --> 48:35.912
I wish he would have told me that
before he died.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.668
I'm horrible, aren't I?

48:42.628 --> 48:43.629
Yes.

48:44.755 --> 48:45.756
Right?

48:46.840 --> 48:50.218
I deserve to die, right?

48:54.306 --> 48:55.265
Wait!

48:59.311 --> 49:00.687
Hey, wait!

49:04.650 --> 49:06.068
Hold on!

49:07.194 --> 49:09.655
Wait! Hold on!

49:48.902 --> 49:51.363
I'm sorry for everything! I really am!

50:08.588 --> 50:11.174
Keep going.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.302
Keep going.

50:17.764 --> 50:18.974
Keep going.

Gosh, what is that?

51:36.718 --> 51:40.639

I told you my destination.

Goodness. You're here.

53:25.452 --> 53:27.746
I finally get to meet you.

53:27.829 --> 53:30.248
Do you not go out that often?
You're too pale.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.499
Give me my towel.

53:38.965 --> 53:40.050
My towel.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.515
What did you
and Kim Min-gyu's wife talk about?

53:50.101 --> 53:52.729
I just met her to console her.

53:52.812 --> 53:55.065
I see. You consoled her.

53:55.148 --> 53:56.232
Right.

53:56.316 --> 54:00.195
I'm sure you know how hard it is
to live without a husband.

54:03.156 --> 54:05.742
Did she know about Lee Jun-hyeon?

54:08.828 --> 54:11.539
You're asking me questions
you know the answers to.

54:11.623 --> 54:14.125
I wouldn't be asking you
if I knew everything.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.378
I'm asking because I don't know.

54:25.845 --> 54:28.098
Who do you think killed Kim Min-gyu?

54:31.101 --> 54:33.019
The case was closed as an accident,

54:33.812 --> 54:35.772
but you're asking me
as if it's a homicide.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.735
Yes, because I think
that's what you believe as well.

54:41.736 --> 54:42.988
Stop playing games with me.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.198
You can tell me.

54:45.281 --> 54:47.659
There wasn't enough evidence
to make that conclusion.

54:47.742 --> 54:49.160
It was as if someone had tried
to cover it up.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.663
Then tell me.

54:51.746 --> 54:55.959
Why do you think the cases are connected
when you've found no evidence?

54:56.042 --> 54:57.711
There was a clear intent.

54:58.336 --> 55:01.297
They could've just killed them
if they wanted to,

55:01.381 --> 55:04.718
but all the cases were disguised
so that no one would be accused.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.137
And?

55:09.431 --> 55:11.391
They all deserved to die.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.894
That's such a frightening thing to say.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.689
Did they do something horrible?

55:17.772 --> 55:20.567
I think I've told you more than enough.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.694
Now it's your turn to explain

55:22.777 --> 55:26.823
why you brought me here
to talk about these things.

55:26.906 --> 55:29.534
I was a bit rude, wasn't I?

55:29.617 --> 55:32.787
I'm just scared.
Something just doesn't feel right.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.957
So let's catch that murderer together.

55:36.666 --> 55:38.126
I wanted to tell you this.

55:49.012 --> 55:51.139
Shouldn't we ask
the police for help first?

55:51.723 --> 55:53.433
We can't trust them.

55:54.059 --> 55:57.103
After all, they're the ones
who removed all the evidence.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.104
Don't you agree?

55:58.188 --> 56:00.523
Not because you don't want them to know?

56:00.607 --> 56:02.108
Don't be ridiculous.

56:02.609 --> 56:05.487
I just think you'd do
a better job than them.

56:05.570 --> 56:07.822
I'm a good judge of character.

56:07.906 --> 56:10.075
What makes you think
I'll accept this offer?

56:11.076 --> 56:14.329
Do you think those people
were the only victims?

56:14.412 --> 56:18.374
You see, I have a variety of resources.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.376
I'll provide you with the information.

56:22.337 --> 56:26.132
I knew you'd like that.
I could tell right away.

56:28.009 --> 56:30.261
I'm running out of time.
So what's your answer?

56:30.345 --> 56:32.555
I'll come up with my own team.

56:32.639 --> 56:35.266
But it will be riskier for us
if more people are invovled.

56:36.226 --> 56:39.104
-I'll provide you with only the best.
-I can't trust the others.

56:39.187 --> 56:41.147
I want NT Life Insurance's
Inspection Team B.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.857
We need a disguise.

56:42.941 --> 56:44.526
What about the risks?

56:47.237 --> 56:49.531
Was that lady the team leader?

56:49.614 --> 56:50.490
Yes, ma'am.

56:50.573 --> 56:52.325
Tell her to come up with a plan.

56:52.408 --> 56:53.952
-I'm sure she can do that much.
-Yes, ma'am.

56:54.035 --> 56:55.745
-Of course.
-Then it's done.

56:58.665 --> 57:02.877
If word gets out,
K might kill you as well.

57:03.545 --> 57:06.506
So let's all be careful, okay?

57:07.924 --> 57:11.052
We call it "K."

57:12.637 --> 57:14.055
Ma'am, we should go.

57:14.139 --> 57:16.182
You should exfoliate while you're here.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.852
They say it's bad for your skin,
but that's not true.

57:18.935 --> 57:21.604
By the way, who are you?

57:23.690 --> 57:26.151
I didn't expect you to ask that.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.989
Pureun Children's Foundation.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.243
God, it breaks my heart.

57:38.955 --> 57:40.415
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

57:40.498 --> 57:41.791
Bow.

57:41.875 --> 57:45.128
Good. Be careful
climbing up the stairs. Don't fall.

57:45.211 --> 57:46.588
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.506
-Hurry up!
-Who is that?

57:48.590 --> 57:50.758
Hurry! Okay.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.135
Sir, let's go.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.388
-Do you have your seat belts on?
-Yes.

57:57.307 --> 58:01.186
PUREUN SAESSAK KINDERGARTEN

58:05.023 --> 58:06.816
Goodness. Who are you?

58:06.900 --> 58:08.693
I live here.

58:08.776 --> 58:10.069
Unit 305.

58:10.737 --> 58:11.779
Or was it 306?

58:12.780 --> 58:14.949
-It's Unit--
-You're finally here.

58:15.033 --> 58:17.118
Hey!

58:17.202 --> 58:18.244
She's here.

58:25.543 --> 58:27.420
I thought you were a clean freak.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.255
What happened?

58:43.561 --> 58:45.063
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

59:10.088 --> 59:12.423
You see this? I'm alive.

59:16.469 --> 59:17.637
<i>That was seasy.</i>

59:22.684 --> 59:26.980
<i>That was seasy.</i>

59:28.815 --> 59:30.108
<i>That was easy.</i>

59:34.821 --> 59:36.322
You should take a shower.

59:37.407 --> 59:38.575
You reek.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.499
Aren't you coming?

59:52.213 --> 59:55.383
You're wrong. People die easily.

59:55.466 --> 59:57.218
So stop them whenever you can.

1:00:11.107 --> 1:00:12.150
I should, right?

1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:17.780
Instead of just suspecting, I should do it
because I can and I want to, right?

1:00:19.574 --> 1:00:20.992
Are you ready?

1:00:31.586 --> 1:00:35.173
Let me play one round and unwind.

1:01:06.204 --> 1:01:07.455
Just as I expected.

1:01:08.581 --> 1:01:10.124
Santa.

1:01:10.208 --> 1:01:12.210
Which comes first? Shampoo or conditioner?

1:01:13.252 --> 1:01:15.672
-They're getting kicked out.
-Unbelievable.

1:01:15.755 --> 1:01:17.048
My heart breaks for them.

1:01:17.131 --> 1:01:18.758
-It hurts.
-That's enough.

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:20.093
Stop teasing them.

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:23.513
-Gosh.
-Poor things.

1:01:23.596 --> 1:01:25.556
-Look at them.
-Nice.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.392
It's because they're incompetent.

1:01:27.475 --> 1:01:29.143
-I'm a bit scared.
-What is this?

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:30.687
Excuse me.

1:01:31.771 --> 1:01:33.523
What? Shouldn't you be working?

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.359
No, we're being disbanded.

1:01:36.442 --> 1:01:37.860
Why?

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:40.071
Because of our poor performance.

1:01:42.073 --> 1:01:43.449
This can't happen.

1:01:45.159 --> 1:01:46.285
What do you mean?

1:01:46.369 --> 1:01:48.871
This team can't be disbanded.

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:51.541
Then let's improve your performance.

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:54.419
Hey, bring them to me.

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:56.963
-Bring what?
-The documents.

1:01:58.631 --> 1:01:59.882
NT LIFE INSURANCE

1:02:00.466 --> 1:02:01.843
You're serious, right?

1:02:06.431 --> 1:02:07.765
Let's do this.

1:02:08.766 --> 1:02:11.561
Client number one. He fell down the stairs

1:02:11.644 --> 1:02:13.813
and damaged his disc.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:17.608
He claims he can't bend
his back at all now.

1:02:21.195 --> 1:02:23.114
This is at a bronze level.

1:02:26.993 --> 1:02:29.662
<i>First, hear him out.</i>

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:31.789
Is this where you fell?

1:02:31.873 --> 1:02:34.167
I must've rolled down the stairs.

1:02:34.250 --> 1:02:37.879
When I opened my eyes, I saw stars.

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:39.046
Then demonstrate it.

1:02:39.130 --> 1:02:40.089
Like this?

1:02:46.179 --> 1:02:47.764
Yes. Like that.

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:51.017
I see. We'll have it taken care of
as soon as possible.

1:03:04.405 --> 1:03:05.406
My gosh!

1:03:09.243 --> 1:03:11.954
You can bend your back.

1:03:19.170 --> 1:03:20.213
Next.

1:03:20.713 --> 1:03:22.632
She became deaf due to an accident.

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:25.301
She runs a butcher's with her husband.

1:03:29.388 --> 1:03:31.557
This requires team play.

1:03:32.433 --> 1:03:33.810
Watch carefully.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:42.026
My kids want pork cutlet.

1:03:44.111 --> 1:03:45.279
Right.

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:48.157
You lost your hearing.

1:03:49.450 --> 1:03:50.493
Here.

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:56.624
What?

1:03:56.707 --> 1:03:58.584
A car accident?

1:03:58.668 --> 1:04:01.712
Kids from Hando Elementary got injured?

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:04.715
A male third grader?

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:06.759
What?

1:04:07.343 --> 1:04:09.053
You can't reach his parents?

1:04:10.930 --> 1:04:13.641
Because his mom lost hearing?

1:04:13.724 --> 1:04:17.144
Ma'am! We have a problem!
What's Min-jun's blood type?

1:04:17.228 --> 1:04:18.271
Blood type A!

1:04:23.568 --> 1:04:24.569
What's going on?

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:26.529
I'm from NT Life Insurance.

1:04:28.406 --> 1:04:29.699
Damn it!

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:31.826
Next.

1:04:32.702 --> 1:04:34.954
He has stage three thyroid cancer.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:39.208
He said he'd never had cancer before,
but his doctor found surgery scars.

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:43.880
Let's see.

1:04:44.630 --> 1:04:46.090
Call an insurance planner.

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:50.344
Now you're finally back to your old self.

1:05:03.274 --> 1:05:04.483
Hey, Aunt.

1:05:07.528 --> 1:05:10.656
Right. I'm supposed
to receive counseling today.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:14.911
<i>No, I don't have any nightmares.</i>

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:17.622
I'm fine.

1:05:18.164 --> 1:05:19.415
Any other issues?

1:05:25.212 --> 1:05:27.006
Just that my aunt

1:05:27.089 --> 1:05:30.801
coddles me way too much.

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:33.387
Come on. Don't be absurd.

1:05:36.849 --> 1:05:39.018
I'm so sorry, but it's work-related.

1:05:39.101 --> 1:05:40.603
Sure. Take it, please.

1:05:40.686 --> 1:05:41.812
Okay.

1:05:43.064 --> 1:05:43.940
Hello?

1:05:45.691 --> 1:05:47.693
You should come to see my play.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.195
What's your role this time?

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:50.404
It's <i>Crown Prince Sado.</i>

1:05:50.488 --> 1:05:52.281
-I'm playing royal subordinate one.
-Right.

1:05:52.365 --> 1:05:54.408
-Yes, I can right now.
-I look forward to it.

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:57.995
So I need to meet with

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:01.415
Inspector Koo Kyung-yi?

1:06:04.001 --> 1:06:06.212
I see. Okay.

1:06:11.467 --> 1:06:13.302
I'm afraid I can't go shopping today.

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:14.345
What?

1:06:14.428 --> 1:06:17.932
I have to meet
with an insurance inspector for work.

1:06:18.724 --> 1:06:23.354
And that inspector is notorious
for being reckless.

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:24.271
I see.

1:06:24.355 --> 1:06:25.606
I'll drop you off.

1:06:26.232 --> 1:06:28.317
You can't come to my workplace.

1:06:28.818 --> 1:06:30.194
I can take the subway.

1:06:30.277 --> 1:06:33.364
Please. I'll stay in the car
and wait for you.

1:06:33.447 --> 1:06:35.616
We can go shopping afterwards. Okay?

1:06:36.742 --> 1:06:39.203
Forming a bond is crucial, right?

1:06:39.286 --> 1:06:42.415
A strong bond
brings emotional stability, right?

1:06:43.124 --> 1:06:46.252
You should let her tag along.
I think this is enough for today.

1:06:46.877 --> 1:06:49.755
And she's doing better now,

1:06:49.839 --> 1:06:52.341
so let's meet every six months.

1:06:53.426 --> 1:06:56.429
Really? Thank you so much.

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:57.888
Don't mention it.

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:01.600
See? I told you I was fine.

1:07:01.684 --> 1:07:02.601
Goodness.

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:05.771
-Thank you so much.
-Goodbye.

1:07:05.855 --> 1:07:07.148
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

1:07:07.231 --> 1:07:09.358
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

1:07:32.757 --> 1:07:36.260
Goodness, Jin-mo. What's happened?

1:07:36.343 --> 1:07:37.678
Did you injure yourself?

1:07:37.762 --> 1:07:40.765
No, I'm just a little unwell.

1:07:41.265 --> 1:07:42.600
Where?

1:07:43.976 --> 1:07:45.936
Do you not know what he's suffering from?

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:47.229
You startled me.

1:07:48.647 --> 1:07:51.192
It's been a while, Ms. Koo.

1:07:51.942 --> 1:07:53.903
Are you familiar
with the duty of notification?

1:07:54.695 --> 1:07:56.739
When he took out the insurance,

1:07:56.822 --> 1:07:59.992
did he tell you
he already had thyroid cancer?

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:04.705
It wasn't checked on the document,

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:06.582
but he insists that he told you.

1:08:08.751 --> 1:08:11.295
Jeong-yeon, remember what you said?

1:08:11.879 --> 1:08:13.714
You said not to check it

1:08:13.798 --> 1:08:16.008
since they couldn't
check my record abroad.

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:18.427
You said I needed the insurance

1:08:18.511 --> 1:08:20.554
to be able to afford the hospital bills.

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:25.643
If he's telling the truth,
this is insurance fraud.

1:08:28.729 --> 1:08:30.856
My aunt wouldn't do such a thing.

1:08:32.191 --> 1:08:34.485
You said you'd wait in the car.

1:08:35.236 --> 1:08:39.865
The sole evidence you have
is her testimony, right?

1:08:41.033 --> 1:08:43.327
Correct. Nothing's on paper.

1:08:47.998 --> 1:08:50.876
Come on. I never said such a thing.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:56.173
Given your age, I just thought
cancer insurance would be useful.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:58.592
Hey. How could you…

1:09:00.511 --> 1:09:01.679
Come on out.

1:09:04.181 --> 1:09:06.684
The insurer has the right
to terminate an insurance plan

1:09:06.767 --> 1:09:09.520
if the insured hasn't
provided all the necessary information.

1:09:10.437 --> 1:09:12.106
Was this the last one?

1:09:16.694 --> 1:09:17.653
Wait…

1:09:24.201 --> 1:09:25.202
Wait.

1:09:26.203 --> 1:09:27.371
Excuse me.

1:09:28.747 --> 1:09:32.293
To be frank, I lied
because I was afraid of getting fired.

1:09:32.376 --> 1:09:33.961
I won't do this ever--

1:09:34.044 --> 1:09:37.006
"You had him pay us for months,
and now we can terminate the plan.

1:09:37.089 --> 1:09:39.592
This is a plus for us.
Please keep up your work."

1:09:39.675 --> 1:09:41.552
This is what they'll probably tell you.

1:09:41.635 --> 1:09:42.845
I'm sorry?

1:09:42.928 --> 1:09:44.430
Worry about yourself.

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:46.724
If anything, the company
will fire you first.

1:09:57.067 --> 1:09:58.068
What was that?

1:09:59.445 --> 1:10:02.323
You had a piece of raw meat in your hair.

1:10:03.032 --> 1:10:05.242
Hey, let's go shopping. Come on.

1:10:07.036 --> 1:10:08.954
Why are you pretending not to know me?

1:11:07.221 --> 1:11:10.015
<i>Call me if there's anything you need.</i>

1:11:10.099 --> 1:11:13.727
A serial murder
without any evidence or a suspect.

1:11:13.811 --> 1:11:16.855
<i>I doubt they'd even figure out
how I killed him.</i>

1:11:16.939 --> 1:11:18.691
<i>We're looking for the killer.</i>

1:11:18.774 --> 1:11:22.278
Don't think about why they are dead.
Think about why they were killed.

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:24.154
<i>So he's a bad man.</i>

1:11:24.238 --> 1:11:26.699
Since the murders were planned
over a long period of time…

1:11:26.782 --> 1:11:30.577
Why was it them,
out of all the people in the world?

1:11:30.661 --> 1:11:32.496
<i>Mr. Jang must be in a better place, right?</i>

1:11:37.251 --> 1:11:38.711
<i>To kill without getting caught.</i>

1:11:38.794 --> 1:11:40.796
<i>I'd find people who would never betray me.</i>

1:11:40.879 --> 1:11:43.424
<i>People who'd never betray you?</i>

1:11:43.507 --> 1:11:45.050
<i>Why could I betray them?</i>

1:13:44.586 --> 1:13:49.591
