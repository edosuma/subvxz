WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:05.629
Sorry!

00:10.092 --> 00:12.094
Brian! Slow down in the hallway!

00:12.094 --> 00:13.929
Can't, Ki! Gotta hustle!

00:15.181 --> 00:16.807
Got a telegram from my mom.

00:20.728 --> 00:23.689
Brian! What's the hurry?

00:23.689 --> 00:25.023
Meetin' my mom at the bus stop.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.900
We still on
for that thing today?

00:26.901 --> 00:29.153
Yep. Definitely.

00:31.113 --> 00:32.781
Hey, Brian, you still up
for that thing later?

00:32.782 --> 00:34.450
Oh, crap, that thing
that was today?

00:34.450 --> 00:36.493
I've got another thing
with Jenny.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.288
It's, uh, FPS stuff.

00:39.288 --> 00:40.789
Oh.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.500
I'll de-wax the boogie boards.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.586
Awesome. We'll hang out
tomorrow, all right?

00:55.721 --> 00:58.014
All right.

00:58.015 --> 01:02.269
My mom's coming to visit, and I haven't
heard from her since I left for VGHS.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.896
Sounds boring.

01:03.896 --> 01:05.564
Well, it's not.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.494
Cheeto?

01:29.630 --> 01:31.089
Dude! Your mom's a cat!

01:31.090 --> 01:32.800
Your mom's a cat!

02:10.755 --> 02:12.381
Practice. Time for practice.

02:12.381 --> 02:14.007
I thought we were practicing,

02:14.008 --> 02:16.510
but if you need
more time to review...

02:16.510 --> 02:17.969
Ahhh!

02:17.970 --> 02:19.763
But seriously, I'm gonna go now,

02:19.764 --> 02:22.558
and then in two and a half
minutes, you can...

02:22.558 --> 02:26.895
You're kind of freakin' out
about this, aren't you?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.189
Freaking out? I'm not freaking out.
You're freaking...

02:30.483 --> 02:32.234
Sorry. Saves the alarm.

02:32.234 --> 02:34.110
Okay, I'm freaking out.

02:34.111 --> 02:38.611
Dude, chill. This is
supposed to be fun.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.368
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm just...

02:41.369 --> 02:42.912
Your mom can't
find out about us.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.538
I mean, nobody can
find out about us,

02:44.538 --> 02:47.207
and this is for real now.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.919
I'm just... I'm afraid
I'm gonna blow it.

02:53.005 --> 02:55.465
Brian, disarm the bomb.
It's gonna blow.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.783
Are you serious, Brian?

03:22.368 --> 03:23.994
You suck!

03:23.994 --> 03:26.663
Can't disarm a bomb.
I can disarm a bomb.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.248
I can disarm two bombs.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.792
Sorry, guys.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.084
My bad.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.295
Bomb disarms are newb 101.

03:33.295 --> 03:35.714
Any pro should be able
to do it blindfolded.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.717
Coach, I swear I can
normally do this.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.262
On that uplifting note,
that's practice.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.680
Everyone's dismissed.

03:48.894 --> 03:50.520
Jenny, stick around.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.399
So, about Brian,
what do you think?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.736
I think he's still
in the room, mom.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.448
Not for long. I...

04:05.077 --> 04:06.953
See ya when I see ya.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.208
Well, that was awkward.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.710
I want to bench Brian tomorrow.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.713
Okay.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.214
Why are you telling me?

04:17.214 --> 04:20.216
You're my captain.
I want to hear your opinion.

04:20.216 --> 04:24.304
Well, he's one of the
strongest players in our team.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.848
I wouldn't bench him
just because he

04:25.848 --> 04:27.474
couldn't disarm one stupid bomb.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.685
Guys like Brian are all talent
and no discipline.

04:29.685 --> 04:31.728
It shows up in stuff like this.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.398
One stupid bomb could make
us lose the game tomorrow.

04:34.398 --> 04:35.899
You understand?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.985
Yeah. It sounds like
you've made up your mind.

04:37.985 --> 04:40.737
I'll tell you what:
You make the call.

04:40.738 --> 04:44.867
Bench him or not.
Just let me know by game time.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.753
Wendell. Rule number five.
No sodas in the hallway.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.046
D'uh.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.089
Sorry.

05:02.092 --> 05:03.593
Wendell!

05:03.594 --> 05:05.637
No throwing trash
in the hallways.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.847
Rule number 38.

05:06.847 --> 05:10.475
D'oh! I... it was an accident.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.561
Unfortunately, I caught you
with silly string earlier.

05:12.561 --> 05:14.187
That's three infractions.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.439
You know what that means.

05:16.982 --> 05:18.441
Bathroom duty?

05:18.442 --> 05:20.277
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

05:20.277 --> 05:21.528
D'ooh!

05:27.743 --> 05:29.202
Number one r.A.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.413
<i>Snaps, kl.</i>

05:31.413 --> 05:33.998
Really. Snaps.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.626
Though I think number two
would be more appropriate!

05:36.627 --> 05:40.380
- Oh, my gosh.
- Scooped this off your floor a couple minutes ago.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.799
This isn't just some normal poop

05:41.799 --> 05:44.176
like one of the students
might leave. Oh, no.

05:44.176 --> 05:46.386
This came from an animal.

05:46.387 --> 05:50.224
In fact, I'm willing
to bet it came from a...

05:57.106 --> 05:58.190
Whoo!

06:04.572 --> 06:09.072
Poopie man Shane!
Poopie man Shane!

06:13.956 --> 06:15.832
What were we talking about?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.209
Ugh.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.254
<i>No pets allowed, kl.</i>

06:20.254 --> 06:24.424
So when I find that cat,
you can say goodbye to number one,

06:24.425 --> 06:27.386
"cause she's coming over
to my place."

06:27.386 --> 06:30.389
We're moving in together,
me and one.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.099
Big step for our relationship.

06:32.099 --> 06:34.267
My friends say I'm
one-whipped, but I don't care,

06:34.268 --> 06:35.769
"cause I'm ready to commit."

06:35.769 --> 06:37.145
Because I...

06:37.146 --> 06:39.022
Love...

06:39.023 --> 06:40.524
Number one.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.163
30-foot range.

07:08.218 --> 07:10.887
What the heck is wrong
with you, Ted?

07:10.888 --> 07:12.556
God! I've been holding
this track for hours.

07:12.556 --> 07:14.099
When do I get the toy car?

07:14.099 --> 07:15.475
This is not a toy, Ted.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.979
This is a custom overdrift
USB supercar.

07:18.979 --> 07:20.855
What? I want one even more now.

07:20.856 --> 07:22.440
D.k., when do I get one?

07:26.111 --> 07:29.489
Theodore, you've been a
drifter for nary a fortmonth.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.117
Earning a supercar
is no small challenge.

07:32.117 --> 07:35.829
It's only for
super serious racers.

07:35.829 --> 07:38.081
Serious?

07:38.082 --> 07:41.877
I stole soda for you guys.
I beat the duchess.

07:41.877 --> 07:44.212
And I built this boss track.

07:44.213 --> 07:48.008
And all my friends have
one, and I want one. Now.

07:48.008 --> 07:49.926
Very well, child.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.929
If you will not heed my warning,

07:51.929 --> 07:54.640
go grab a book
from the bookshelf.

08:06.318 --> 08:08.153
Oh, my god.

08:27.548 --> 08:31.176
I'll know you missed me because
I missed you too, buddy.

08:31.176 --> 08:33.595
But dad's gotta go now to
practice his stupid minigame,

08:33.595 --> 08:36.889
a minigame that if he messes
up, will ruin our entire season.

08:39.601 --> 08:41.394
Heard that.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.479
I missed this.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.275
All right. Wish me luck.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.195
Brian, have you seen a...

08:50.195 --> 08:52.197
That. Is a cat.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.781
You have a cat in your room.

08:53.782 --> 08:56.159
Oh, yeah, that's cheeto,
my best bud from home.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.203
Cheeto, this is Ki.
She's awesome.

08:58.203 --> 08:59.787
All right, well, I gotta go.

08:59.788 --> 09:01.998
You two have fun.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.251
Gotta practice.

09:04.251 --> 09:05.543
Uh...

09:05.544 --> 09:07.212
Brian.

09:07.212 --> 09:08.504
Rule number 35.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.093
Are the cat that's been
pooping on my floor?

09:15.429 --> 09:17.055
Whew. Yes, you are.

09:30.444 --> 09:34.944
Behold overdrift purgatorio.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.576
Designed by the zen
drifting monks

09:37.576 --> 09:39.452
of the hokkaido region,

09:39.453 --> 09:43.953
it remains the most extreme
overdrift game ever conceived.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.753
Should a player be brave enough,

09:47.753 --> 09:50.046
skilled enough,

09:50.047 --> 09:51.631
crazy enough

09:51.632 --> 09:55.469
to tame one of the wild
supercars within,

09:55.469 --> 09:58.638
purgatorio
shall Grant him a Jewel

09:58.639 --> 10:00.307
fit for a king!

10:06.146 --> 10:08.439
Alas...

10:08.440 --> 10:12.940
In their mad dreams
to construct the ultimate racer,

10:13.612 --> 10:17.073
the drift monks installed
a feature way too hardcore

10:17.074 --> 10:19.451
for the casual gamer.

10:19.451 --> 10:22.787
You see, when you
enter purgatorio,

10:22.788 --> 10:26.416
you cannot leave until you win.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.876
They say one kid got trapped
in there for three days.

10:28.877 --> 10:30.837
I heard another kid
peed his pants.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.923
I heard a kid died.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.679
All those legends are
both true and untrue,

10:38.679 --> 10:41.098
except for the one
where the kid died.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.682
That's why they banned the game

10:42.683 --> 10:45.894
and purgatorio vanished
into antiquity,

10:45.894 --> 10:49.397
until I found a copy... on ebay.

10:49.398 --> 10:53.485
So, Theodore, now that
you've heard the tale,

10:53.485 --> 10:55.778
ll have only one question:

11:07.124 --> 11:09.793
Did you go
to the bathroom first?

11:09.793 --> 11:14.293
I. Can. Hold it.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.723
We shall see, Ted.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.641
We shall see.

11:59.384 --> 12:01.844
Come on, you've done this
a thousand times.

12:13.982 --> 12:15.316
Ah. Hi, buddy!

12:17.819 --> 12:20.154
All right.
No more screwing around.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.129
Gah!

12:56.149 --> 12:58.734
I can do this.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.716
Dang it!

13:26.763 --> 13:28.681
He's been in there
for hours, d.K.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.850
He's not ready for this.

13:30.851 --> 13:34.855
Were you ready, trixi?
Were any of us?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.901
Crap, I've really gotta pee.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.584
All right, okay.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.511
No. It can't be.

14:06.511 --> 14:08.262
I thought they patched her out.

14:08.263 --> 14:09.430
Patched her out?

14:09.431 --> 14:11.474
That car's no bug, child.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.809
Then what is she?

14:12.809 --> 14:14.852
A cruel joke
programmed by the monks

14:14.853 --> 14:17.689
at the height of their madness.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.315
Let her pass, Ted.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.609
Heed not her siren's call.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.821
Sweet stripes.

14:24.821 --> 14:27.156
No way you're getting past me
without a race, buddy.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.420
Now poop.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.675
Good boy.

14:58.313 --> 15:01.566
Hello, um, do you want me to
do the girls' bathroom too,

15:01.566 --> 15:03.401
or just...

15:03.402 --> 15:06.446
Ho, is... is that a cat?

15:09.449 --> 15:12.869
Yes, uh, yes it is... a cat.

15:12.869 --> 15:17.248
Why would you have a cat? You're breaking,
uh, rule... you're breaking rule 35.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.751
Well, you see,
that's not entirely true.

15:19.751 --> 15:21.502
I am the r.A.,
and I just trained...

15:21.503 --> 15:23.588
Uh-uh. No, no. "Cause you..."

15:23.588 --> 15:25.006
You said rules are rules.

15:25.006 --> 15:28.676
That's what you...
That's what you said.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.096
- You said rules are rules.
- Wendell, control your breathing.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.890
<i>No, no! You're
breaking the rules, kl.</i>

15:33.890 --> 15:36.183
<i>"M not..."</i>

15:36.184 --> 15:40.021
I'm not gonna listen to
anything you say anymore, okay?

15:40.021 --> 15:41.939
Oh, my god.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.233
Everyone! Everyone!

15:44.234 --> 15:45.360
Wendell!

15:45.360 --> 15:48.196
Everyone! Everyone! Everyone!

15:48.196 --> 15:51.115
Kl is housing a cat.
She's breaking the rules!

15:51.116 --> 15:52.992
Everybody back inside.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.370
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

15:55.370 --> 15:56.746
Wendell, can I see you
in Ted's...?

15:56.746 --> 15:58.831
They're just a lie.
Nothing is real.

15:58.832 --> 16:03.332
All authority...
Authority is finished!

16:04.129 --> 16:06.047
Silly string!

16:11.845 --> 16:13.638
Oh, my...! No! No!

16:15.807 --> 16:17.058
Oh, no!

16:46.087 --> 16:47.588
Brian!

16:53.720 --> 16:55.638
Hey, how's it going?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.350
All freshed up?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.143
Yeah, yeah, good to go.

17:00.143 --> 17:03.688
Good. Well,
in that case, wanna go?

17:03.688 --> 17:05.231
Uh...

17:05.232 --> 17:07.858
You know, actually,
ll think I may just stay.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.777
And practice a little more.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.363
Really? You're good,
though, right?

17:12.364 --> 17:15.325
Like, for tomorrow,
you've got the whole bomb thing down?

17:15.325 --> 17:19.078
Yeah, yeah.
No. All the way down.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.205
'Cause Brian, if you don't,
I really need to know that.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.249
No, no, no.
Jenny, yeah, I, uh...

17:23.250 --> 17:25.252
You know what? I've been
at this for, like, hours,

17:25.252 --> 17:28.463
<i>so, why don't we go
grab a bite to eat?</i>

17:34.135 --> 17:35.511
See you in the closet in five.

17:41.434 --> 17:42.476
Okay.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.694
Oh, no, not again!

18:14.301 --> 18:16.386
Yeah!

18:16.386 --> 18:19.722
Well, girl,
you are pretty crazy.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.307
But I like that.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.102
I am gonna call you...

18:24.102 --> 18:25.561
Hellenor.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.522
What?

18:27.522 --> 18:29.482
You're my car now!

18:29.482 --> 18:31.567
Hellenor, come back!

18:32.986 --> 18:34.028
What...?

18:48.543 --> 18:51.712
Come on, d.K.
We'll pry him out in the morning.

19:31.378 --> 19:35.006
Attention, frag floor residents:

19:35.006 --> 19:38.092
Rules are rules.
That means no pets.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.352
No silly string.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.395
No sodas in the halls,

19:49.396 --> 19:51.106
no unsanctioned pizza parties.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.315
Now, clean up!

20:03.326 --> 20:05.411
What have I done?

20:05.412 --> 20:07.247
Cheeto?

20:07.247 --> 20:10.250
Cheeto? Cheeto?

20:35.483 --> 20:36.525
To...

20:39.654 --> 20:42.281
Explosive chemistry.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.202
I can't do it.
I can't disarm a bomb.

20:46.202 --> 20:48.287
What? You said that you could.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.206
I lied. I'm sorry.

20:50.206 --> 20:53.375
I told my mom that you could do it.
She wanted to bench you.

20:53.376 --> 20:56.337
- Well, I can't. She probably should.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

20:56.337 --> 20:57.880
You'll just do your Brian
thing, and it'll all...

20:57.881 --> 20:59.465
No, Jenny, I can't do it.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.925
I couldn't do it all afternoon.

21:00.925 --> 21:03.135
I don't know why,
I just... I can't.

21:04.345 --> 21:06.013
Well, that sucks.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.974
I'm gonna have to put
somebody else in.

21:07.974 --> 21:12.474
Look, just... next time don't
lie to me about it, okay?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.939
I won't. I promise.

21:14.939 --> 21:16.440
All right.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.483
I should go.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.403
Thanks.

21:29.078 --> 21:30.788
Okay.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.707
Thirty-second time's the charm.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.292
Easy, girl.

21:36.544 --> 21:37.795
Easy.

21:39.672 --> 21:41.131
No!

21:41.132 --> 21:42.174
No!

21:43.343 --> 21:44.927
What do you want from me?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.517
You want to race again?

21:51.518 --> 21:52.852
Well, forget it.

21:52.852 --> 21:54.186
I hate you.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.147
You're a stupid, cheating butt,

21:56.147 --> 21:58.607
and I hope you crash,
you piece of junk.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.193
You heard what I said. Go away!

22:41.192 --> 22:42.443
Cheeto?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.741
Cheeto!

22:50.994 --> 22:52.078
Cheeto!

22:53.246 --> 22:54.830
Hi.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.332
I'm sorry I threw you
out there earlier.

22:56.332 --> 22:58.042
I didn't mean to.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.210
I did mean to, but...

23:00.211 --> 23:01.879
Let's get you home to Brian.

23:04.632 --> 23:07.885
Man, cats are really
easy to grab, am I right?

23:07.886 --> 23:09.596
Especially the dumb ones.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.181
Well, it's time
to get you in trouble.

23:12.181 --> 23:15.225
Shane, please.
That's Brian's cat.

23:15.226 --> 23:17.603
You're a businessman.
I'm sure we can work this out.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.148
Sorry, kiwi. Rules are rules.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.696
Aaahhh!

24:31.094 --> 24:33.387
Those guys being mean
to you back there?

24:37.725 --> 24:40.310
There you go.

24:40.311 --> 24:41.729
That's better.

24:43.189 --> 24:45.691
Look, do you want to race?

24:45.692 --> 24:48.569
<i>"I'm gonna be stuck here
for a while, so..."</i>

24:50.488 --> 24:53.699
Okay, hey, no fair starting without me.
Whoa, what...? Hey!

25:26.357 --> 25:27.900
- I'm empty.
- Here.

25:34.365 --> 25:35.866
Okay, on three.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.618
Okay, yeah, I get it.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.904
Heads up. It's the final round.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.657
Vghs has one last chance
to disarm the bomb

26:16.657 --> 26:18.241
and win the game.

26:22.121 --> 26:23.664
Games, don't charge the bomb.

26:23.664 --> 26:24.956
- Sorry, coach.
- I don't need sorry.

26:24.957 --> 26:26.833
I need you to get it together.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.335
This is the final round, guys.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.379
They are adapting and
nailing us to the wall.

26:30.379 --> 26:31.546
I need to throw them
a curve ball.

26:31.547 --> 26:32.798
Put in Brian.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.967
With all due respect, coach,

26:34.967 --> 26:36.593
Brian will crush this.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.762
I know he may be undisciplined,

26:38.763 --> 26:40.389
but when you need him,

26:40.389 --> 26:42.224
he steps up to the plate.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.225
Trust me.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.852
Put him in.

26:45.853 --> 26:48.021
Coach, with
even more due respect,

26:48.022 --> 26:50.274
yeah, the deanster may
have failed to cover Jenny,

26:50.274 --> 26:53.402
but when the going gets
tough, the deanster gets...

26:53.402 --> 26:55.862
Out. Dean, you're out.

26:55.863 --> 26:56.863
Brian's in.

27:17.718 --> 27:19.219
Hey.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.930
I get it.

27:20.930 --> 27:21.972
You just wanna play.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.353
Okay, then, let's play.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.401
Jacks, move!

28:20.448 --> 28:21.699
Ha ha!

28:25.328 --> 28:26.620
Aah!

28:30.541 --> 28:33.460
Aah!

28:42.345 --> 28:43.888
Aah!

28:56.734 --> 28:59.069
Ohh!

29:03.532 --> 29:04.950
Law, turn it around!

29:04.951 --> 29:07.161
No can do. It's out of range.

29:07.161 --> 29:10.247
Also, who's this Law feller
y'all talkin' about?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.874
What happens when it goes
out of range, Law?

29:11.874 --> 29:13.959
It goes home.

29:13.960 --> 29:18.460
I'm not Law!

29:24.095 --> 29:28.595
Vghs! Vghs! Vghs!

29:52.206 --> 29:54.499
Well, it's just you
and me now, Jacks.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.628
Bomb armed.

29:57.628 --> 30:01.256
Okay. 'Tm gonna go stand up
now, disarm the bomb.

30:05.928 --> 30:06.928
Idiot.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.524
Yes! Great race!

30:22.820 --> 30:25.656
Really? Think I'm gonna
fall for that again?

30:44.967 --> 30:47.177
Yes!

31:17.208 --> 31:18.876
Ohh, sh...!

33:07.026 --> 33:08.610
Meow.

33:22.416 --> 33:23.416
Way to go, Brian!

33:33.385 --> 33:35.845
And that's how I got cheeto
to become the school mascot.

33:35.846 --> 33:37.347
Thanks again, Ki.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.640
How was your day, Ted?

33:38.641 --> 33:40.351
Well, it was all right.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.853
Psych! It was awesome!

33:42.853 --> 33:45.230
Okay, first I woke up.
No, wait, go back.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.566
First I was asleep,
and then I woke up,

33:47.566 --> 33:50.652
and then I went to purgatorio!

33:50.653 --> 33:51.862
For 84 hours straight.

33:51.862 --> 33:53.238
What's that?

33:53.239 --> 33:56.450
Dude, it is only the sickest,
raddest, most...

34:10.464 --> 34:11.715
He's on to me.

34:13.259 --> 34:14.802
Better call.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.844
What?

34:30.067 --> 34:31.693
Better call who?

34:31.694 --> 34:33.487
Oh, god. Oh, okay.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.071
Sorry, man,
I'll let you get back to that.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.824
No problem. By the way,
it's "better call whom?"

34:37.824 --> 34:39.076
Oh, sweet, thanks!

34:46.292 --> 34:48.752
Better call whom?

34:48.752 --> 34:51.129
He was wrong.
It's "better call who?"

34:51.130 --> 34:52.922
I knew it!

34:52.922 --> 34:55.967
No, no! I don't need anybody!
