WEBVTT

00:04.600 --> 00:06.033
- DO WE KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

00:06.070 --> 00:07.799
- NO CLUE.
GOT THE SAME MEMO YOU DID.

00:07.840 --> 00:08.795
- HEY, DID YOU GUYS
GET THE MEMO?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.535
both: WE GOT THE MEMO.

00:10.570 --> 00:11.969
- WE HAD TO SHARE A MEMO.
- WHO SENT THE MEMO?

00:12.010 --> 00:14.604
- LET'S JUST HOPE
IT'S NOT FROM TROUT.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.244
GOD...

00:16.280 --> 00:18.874
PLEASE LET IT NOT BE TROUT.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.674
AMEN.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.082
[all gasp]

00:27.120 --> 00:29.429
- WELL, HELLO, TEAM.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.758
- KAREN!
- YOU CAME BACK.

00:31.790 --> 00:32.927
- CHIEF, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.848
- HE WAS AWFUL.
TROUT WAS HELL.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.765
- MOSTLY FOR LASSIE.
BUT THIS FEELS RICH.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.892
I MEAN, THIS FEELS
LIKE HOME AGAIN.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.989
- IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.598
SO THAT'S
WHY IT'S GONNA BE EVEN HARDER

00:41.640 --> 00:43.198
FOR ME TO SAY
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY NOW.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.277
- [gaSPSJ
YOU'RE HAVING ANOTHER BABY?

00:46.310 --> 00:49.177
- WHAT?
NO.

00:49.210 --> 00:52.668
- OH.
- I CAME BACK TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.247
I'VE ACCEPTED A POSITION
UP NORTH. BAY AREA.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.814
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.715
- CHIEF, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.716
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN BACK YET.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.125
- GUYS, THIS IS THE HARDEST
PROFESSIONAL DECISION

01:03.160 --> 01:04.752
THAT I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE,

01:04.790 --> 01:06.519
AND THAT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.120
GOD, WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.139
AND I AM DAMN PROUD
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE.

01:12.170 --> 01:13.535
I'VE HAD SOME TIME
TO GIVE IT A LOT OF THOUGHT--

01:13.570 --> 01:16.505
- SO EXCUSE ME,
WHO'S THE NEW CHIEF?

01:16.540 --> 01:18.861
- THAT'S STILL UNDETERMINED,
CARLTON.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.229
- OH.
- OKAY.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.908
THIS NEW JOB
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME

01:22.950 --> 01:24.577
TO BUILD A BRAND-NEW STATION
FROM THE GROUND UP,

01:24.610 --> 01:27.511
KEYS TO THE CASTLE--

01:34.460 --> 01:35.984
- SO IS THERE A SHORT LIST?

01:36.020 --> 01:37.829
AND IF SO,
AM I ON IT?

01:37.860 --> 01:39.748
WHAT IS
THE OVERALL LIST SITUATION?

01:39.800 --> 01:43.167
- I PUT IN A CALL, CARLTON.
YOU'LL GET AN INTERVIEW.

01:47.570 --> 01:51.165
- GET IN HERE.
[snlfﬂes]

01:53.010 --> 01:55.831
- I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.
- YUP. YEAH.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.548
- IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE,
KAREN.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.309
- THANK YOU.

02:02.350 --> 02:04.682
- [sighs] WE ARE GONNA MISS
THE HECK OUT OF YOU, CHIEF.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.109
BUT THIS ISN'T GOOD-BYE,

02:07.160 --> 02:08.855
'CAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GOOD-BYE.

02:08.890 --> 02:12.053
- GOOD-BYE, CHIEF.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.819
- CATCH YOU
ON THE FLIP SIDE.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.088
- SHAWN.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.495
- YEAH.
- LEAVE THE FISH.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.465
- MM-HMM.
YUP, THIS DOES NOT BELONG TO ME.

02:29.510 --> 02:33.219
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.755
- JULIET, TAKE A SEAT.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.995
- ALL RIGHT, CARLTON.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.692
YOU ARE THE MAN
WHO WILL BE CHIEF.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.037
IT'S JUST A FORMALITY.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.867
YOU'RE AT THE TOP
OF THE LIST,

02:57.910 --> 02:59.901
SO A_CT LIKE IT.
[Inhales]

02:59.940 --> 03:01.908
[grunting]

03:04.080 --> 03:06.105
WHOO!

03:06.150 --> 03:08.015
- OH, NO, NO,
THERE WAS NO LIST.

03:08.050 --> 03:09.984
I'D NARROWED IT DOWN
TO A FEW CANDIDATES,

03:10.020 --> 03:12.955
AND YOU WEREN'T ONE OF THEM,
BUT THEN KAREN VICK CALLED

03:12.990 --> 03:14.958
AND PRACTICALLY BEGGED ME
TO CONSIDER YOU.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.254
- [coughs]

03:17.290 --> 03:19.053
- HIRING THIS GREAT CITY'S
NEW CHIEF OF POLICE IS--

03:19.090 --> 03:22.150
WELL, IT'S A BIG MOMENT
FOR ME.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.566
THAT WATER IS NOT
FOR THE INTERVIEWEES.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.238
- [coughs]

03:26.270 --> 03:27.999
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF ARCHIE BAXT ER, DETECTIVE?

03:28.040 --> 03:31.134
- EXCUSE ME.
- HE WAS MY UNCLE.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.899
HE WAS THE ONLY FATHER
I EVER KNEW.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.579
HE BROUGHT ME OUT HERE
IN THE BACK OF A STATION WAGON

03:35.610 --> 03:37.908
IN THE '605.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.339
DECENT MAN.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.985
SALT OF THE EARTH.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.112
TEETOTALER.

03:44.150 --> 03:46.038
HE WAS MARRIED TO HIS WORK.

03:46.090 --> 03:48.058
HE MADE HIS LIVING
AS A CRIME REPORTER.

03:48.090 --> 03:51.287
BACK THEN,
THIS TOWN WAS OWNED BY THE MOB,

03:51.330 --> 03:53.298
INCLUDING THE POLICE.

03:53.330 --> 03:57.266
BUT HE DUG A LITTLE TOO DEEP
AND GOT MURDERED FOR IT.

03:57.300 --> 04:01.464
THAT WAS IN 1967 DURING
THE TENURE OF CHIEF OLSON WA'I'I'.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.809
- WA'I'I' WAS
A VERY FINE MAN, SIR.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.432
- OLSON WA'I'I' WAS
A DUPLICITOUS BALD BASTARD

04:05.470 --> 04:08.177
WHO STONEWALLED ANYONE
WHO TRIED TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.677
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF THING

04:09.710 --> 04:11.678
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
ON MY WATCH.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.440
I WILL FIGHT
FOR THOSE WHO--

04:16.750 --> 04:18.741
[scoffs]

04:18.790 --> 04:20.985
- I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE NOW, SIR.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.962
ONE WHICH WILL HAVE
NO SMALL IMPACT ON MY FUTURE

04:32.000 --> 04:34.195
AS CHIEF OF THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.061
THIS FILE IS MY TICKET
TO IMMORTALITY.

04:37.110 --> 04:41.035
STRODE, READ THE AUTOPSY REPORT
AND KEEP IT CLEAN.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.141
- AH, FORMER SBPD CORONER
SLIPPERY DICK MILLER.

04:45.180 --> 04:48.638
BOY, THERE IS A BLAST
FROM THE PAST.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.478
- CARRY ON, STRODE.
- OKAY, WE ARE--

04:51.520 --> 04:55.411
WE ARE LOOKING
AT ONE ARCHIE BAXTER.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.849
LOOKS TO BE ABOUT 6'2".

04:57.890 --> 05:00.290
- WOODY, THERE'S NO BODY.

05:00.330 --> 05:02.298
- OH, IS THAT A RELIEF.
I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS

05:02.330 --> 05:04.218
THE ONLY ONE
THAT COULDN'T SEE IT.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.965
- WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.934
- ARCHIE BAXTER
WAS KILLED IN 1967,

05:07.970 --> 05:10.109
AND THE SBPD SWEPT HIS CASE
UNDER THE RUG.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.938
- SO?
I WASN'T ON THE FORCE IN '67.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.936
WAIT, HOW OLD DO YOU ALL
THINK I AM?

05:14.980 --> 05:16.299
- WHAT DOES A COLD CASE HAVE

05:16.350 --> 05:17.999
TO DO WITH YOU
BEING CHIEF, CARLTON?

05:18.050 --> 05:19.870
- BECAUSE ARCHIE BAXT ER
WAS JUST LIKE ME.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.670
I KNOW HOW HE THINKS.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.517
HE WAS A HOUND FOR JUSTICE,

05:22.550 --> 05:24.017
AND IT GOT HIM KILLED.

05:24.050 --> 05:24.914
PLUS,
HE WAS THE MAYOR'S UNCLE.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.178
- OH.

05:26.220 --> 05:27.915
- KEEP READING, STRODE.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.020
- CAUSE OF DEATH,
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE CHEST.

05:31.060 --> 05:35.224

- FICTION.

06:01.390 --> 06:04.188
ARCHIE BAXT ER WAS A TEETOTALER,
AND THE POLICE REPORT

06:04.230 --> 06:05.959
INDICATES THAT
A SKY BLUE CADILLAC ELDORADO

06:05.990 --> 06:07.389
WAS SEEN DRIVING AWAY
FROM THE CRASH SITE.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.397
DON'T YOU GET IT?

06:08.430 --> 06:09.590
SOMEONE WANTED HIS DEATH

06:09.630 --> 06:11.188

06:11.230 --> 06:12.458
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND
THAT SOMEONE,

06:12.500 --> 06:13.467
AND THE MAYOR'S
GONNA MAKE ME CHIEF,

06:13.500 --> 06:14.865
AND IT'S GONNA BE GLORIOUS.

NOW SADDLE UP,
AND LET'S RIDE.

AS HELL?

09:34.400 --> 09:36.561
- MAN, IT'S GONNA BE
ALL MUSTY IN HERE.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.498
- YOU'RE MUSTY.
- YOUR MAMA'S MUSTY.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.939
- I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL SPLIT UP,

09:39.980 --> 09:41.675
COVER WAY MORE GROUND THAT WAY.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.268
I'LL GO WITH JULES,
AND THIS WHOLE THING

09:43.310 --> 09:45.505
WILL BECOME AN INVESTI-DATE.
- [chuckles]

09:45.550 --> 09:46.448
- SEE WHAT I DID THERE,
YOU GUYS?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.948
- GROW UP.

09:48.980 --> 09:52.689
- SO WHY ARE YOU SO ON FIRE
TO HELP LASSITER

09:52.720 --> 09:54.358
WITH THIS CASE?

09:54.390 --> 09:55.652
- IT'S NOT JUST LASSIE, JULES.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.157
IT'S RUFUS SEWELL.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.021
IT'S SOPHIE B. HAWKINS.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.220
I MEAN, THEY WERE ALL BORN
IN '67.

10:00.260 --> 10:01.955
- AH, I LOVE ME SOME SOPHIE B.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.228
- DAMN, I WISH I WAS YOUR LOVER.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.760
- YOU ARE.
- [gaSPSJ

10:04.800 --> 10:08.065
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I MUST BE DOING THIS FOR US,

10:08.100 --> 10:10.261
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE BUMPED UP
TO HEAD DETECTIVE

10:10.310 --> 10:13.336
WHEN LASSIE GETS PROMOTED
TO CHIEF.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.371
NATURALLY, I'LL GET
A TITLE BUMP AS WELL.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.607
SOMETHING LIKE
"FIRST LOVER IN THE NIGH'ITIME."

10:18.650 --> 10:20.914
HMM?
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BACON?

10:20.950 --> 10:21.917
- YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
FOR SURE.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.646
- OKAY, I SUPPOSE I DON'T.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.385
WE'LL WORKSHOP THE TITLE.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.059
BUT IT'S MOOT,
BECAUSE YOU ARE GONNA BE IN.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.921
AND WE'RE GONNA GET
A HOT TUB.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.757
AND I'M GONNA BUY YOU A DOLPHIN.
- [gaSPSJ

10:32.800 --> 10:35.951
- AND YOU CAN NAME HER CHER,
WHO WAS ALSO BORN IN '67.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.968
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT
TO ME, SHAWN.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.037
- THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.628
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- WHAT?

10:42.670 --> 10:44.365
- WHAT IS THAT?
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

10:44.410 --> 10:45.900
- YOU GONNA STEAL THAT?

10:45.940 --> 10:47.771
- IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME,
SHAWN.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.334
- YOU REALIZE
THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE FRYER?

10:49.380 --> 10:50.301
- IT'S JUST THE BASKET.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.806
- MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.114
- O'HARA, COME LOOK AT THIS.

10:55.850 --> 10:59.616
I WILL BE DAMNED
IF THAT ISN'T CHIEF OLSON WA'I'I'

10:59.650 --> 11:01.550
LIVING IT UP AT THE LIMELIGHTER.

11:01.590 --> 11:02.852
- WHOA, WHOA, LASSIE, JUST
FORGET ABOUT WAIT FOR A SECOND

11:02.890 --> 11:05.757
BECAUSE THAT IS MY GUY

11:05.790 --> 11:06.893
RODNEY CARUSO

11:06.930 --> 11:09.091
AND HIS SMOKING HOT GIRLFRIEND

11:09.130 --> 11:11.564
SCARLET—T JONES.
- [CllCKS tongue]

11:11.600 --> 11:13.989
- COME ON, I CAN SAY THAT ABOUT
WOMEN FROM OTHER CENTURIES.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.668
- RODNEY CARUSO WAS
A COLD-BLOODED KILLER, SHAWN.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.462
- I BET I WOULD HAVE MADE
ONE HELL OF A CAPO

11:18.510 --> 11:21.399
AT LA COSA NOSTRIL.
- NOSTRA.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.668
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I HAVE

11:22.710 --> 11:23.779
A WANDERING SPIRIT,

11:23.810 --> 11:25.505
AND I'M NOT GREAT WITH A BLADE.

11:25.550 --> 11:28.519
I'M GOOD.
- WHAT?

11:28.550 --> 11:31.815
MYLES VELOUR, JR.
AND THE VELOUR-E'I'I'ES.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.886
HE WAS AS COOL
AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PILLOW.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.615
- [grunts]
- MY OLD MAN LISTENED

11:35.660 --> 11:37.218
TO ALL THOSE RECORDS
WHEN I WAS LI'I'I'LE.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.457
[R&B music playing]

11:40.500 --> 11:47.838
*

11:51.570 --> 11:54.232
* WAS IT SOMETHING I SAID

11:54.280 --> 11:55.406
- * SOMETHING I SAID

11:55.440 --> 11:57.704
- * BABY, I GO'I'I'A KNOW

11:57.750 --> 11:59.001
- * SOMETHING I SAID

11:59.050 --> 12:01.348
- * WAS IT SOMETHING I DID

12:01.380 --> 12:02.642
- * SOMETHING I DID

12:02.680 --> 12:04.443
- * DARLING, TELL ME SO

12:04.490 --> 12:06.549
- AND I SAID,
"OH, I GOT ONE BULLET LEFI'."

12:06.590 --> 12:08.649
[laughter]

12:08.690 --> 12:10.453
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.822
CHIEF WA'I'I'.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.498
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU
LOOSENING YOUR TIE

12:14.530 --> 12:16.418
A LITTLE BIT HERE.

12:16.460 --> 12:21.261
AFTER ALL, MI CASA ES SU CASA,
MI AMIGO.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.267
[snaps fingers]

12:22.300 --> 12:24.803
[indistinct chatter]

12:24.840 --> 12:26.728
FORGIVE THIS INTERRUPTION.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.375
THE NEXT ROUND IS ON ME.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.208
- OH!
I LIKE THAT.

12:34.850 --> 12:38.911
- * BABY, I CONFESS
I'M JUST A MAN *

12:38.950 --> 12:42.488
* SO MANY THINGS
THAT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND *

12:43.690 --> 12:46.329
* I CAN CHANGE MY WAYS

12:46.360 --> 12:48.499
* BUT YOU GOT TO, GOT TO,
GOT TO, GOT TO STAY *

12:48.530 --> 12:50.919
* OH!

12:50.970 --> 12:54.337
* WAS IT SOMETHING I SAID
- * SOMETHING I SAID

12:54.370 --> 12:56.565
- * THAT MADE YOU WALK
OUT MY DOOR *

12:56.600 --> 12:57.908
- * SOMETHING I SAID

12:57.940 --> 13:00.477
- * IF IT WAS
SOMETHING I DID *

13:00.510 --> 13:01.738
- * SOMETHING I DID

13:01.780 --> 13:04.374
- * I WON'T DO IT NO MORE

13:07.380 --> 13:10.087
- THANK YOU.
- * SOMETHING I SAID

13:10.120 --> 13:11.644
- THE MAYOR WAS RIGHT
ABOUT WATT.

13:11.690 --> 13:15.558
FIRST HENRY GETS POPPED
BY A DIRTY COP, AND NOW THIS.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.854
THERE ARE MORE STAINS
ON SANTA BARBARA'S CARPET

13:17.890 --> 13:19.482
THAN I CARE TO STEAM.

13:19.530 --> 13:20.622
- CARLTON,
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE

13:20.660 --> 13:22.548
THAN OLD PHOTOS
AND POLICE RECORDS

13:22.600 --> 13:23.828
THAT DON'T EXIST.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.430
WATT IS DEAD,
CARUSO IS DEAD,

13:26.470 --> 13:28.062
EVEN MYLES VELOUR
CASHED IN HIS CHIPS,

13:28.100 --> 13:30.933
SO UNLESS THERE IS SOMEONE ALIVE
WE CAN ACTUALLY TALK TO...

13:30.970 --> 13:32.631
- MELBA BIRDSONG.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.672
- GUS, WE CAN'T JUST MAKE UP
A FUN NAME.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.577
WE NEED AN ACTUAL HUMAN PERSON
WE CAN PUT THE SCREWS TO.

13:37.610 --> 13:40.545
- MELBA BIRDSONG WAS ONE
OF THE VELOUR-ETTES, SHAWN.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.514
AND I KNOW SHE'S STILL ALIVE
BECAUSE SHE'S APPEARING

13:42.550 --> 13:43.881
IN SOUNDER: THE MUSICAL.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.717
IT'S PLAYING
AT THE OLD COSMOPOLITAN.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.286
MY DAD AND I HAVE TICKETS.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.753
AND, YES, I FOUND
THE OTHER PIECE

13:48.790 --> 13:50.280
TO THE FRYER, SO...

13:50.330 --> 13:54.892
* SUCK IT

13:57.470 --> 13:59.688
- MYLES.
[chuckles]

13:59.730 --> 14:03.803
HE WAS SMOOTH
AS THE LORD MAKES 'EM.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.501
- OOH, AND I KNEW IT.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.599
AND THE LORD MAKES 'EM SMOOTH.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.471
- [chuckles] YEAH.

14:09.510 --> 14:10.738
- MS. BIRDSONG,
YOU WERE ABOUT TO TELL US

14:10.780 --> 14:12.702
WHAT YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT OLSON WATT.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.048
- WELL, THERE AIN'T MUCH
TO TELL.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.844
BACK IN THE DAY,
I MADE IT MY BUSINESS

14:17.890 --> 14:20.154
TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE POLICE.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.487
- YOU NEVER SPOKE TO HIM?

14:21.520 --> 14:22.919
- NOT ME.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.951
I HEARD MYLES TALK TO HIM
A TIME OR TWO.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.458
WATT WASN'T PLAYING GAMES.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.491
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.192
- I KNOW CARUSO'S A RAT.
I'M GONNA CLEAN UP THIS SEWER.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.766
YOU KNOW WHERE THE DROP
IS GOING DOWN.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.893
NOW GIVE IT UP--
HEY, I'LL SMACK IT OUT OF YOU.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.908
- LISTEN, MAN, EASY, EASY.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.737
HIS BUSINESS
IS HIS BUSINESS.

14:39.770 --> 14:42.136
WHEN YOU HAVE A CAT
LIKE CARUSO AS YOUR BOSS,

14:42.180 --> 14:44.671
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN,
YOU DIG?

14:44.710 --> 14:47.747
I'M JUST A HAM-AND-EGGS MAN.
- WHAT?

14:47.780 --> 14:49.771
- THE BOSS MAN
DOESN'T EVEN DIG ME, YOU DIG?

14:49.820 --> 14:53.779
I ONLY GOT THIS GIG BECAUSE
HIS CHICK IS A FAN OF THE FUNK.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.481
- SCARLETI' JONES.
- [laughs]

14:55.520 --> 14:57.124
SHE'S A TWIST, BABY.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.424
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
I'LL DO A PRIVATE CLAMBAKE

14:59.460 --> 15:00.654
FOR HIM AND SCARLETT.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.099
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

15:02.130 --> 15:04.826
NO MORE THAN THAT, CHIEF.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.963
- SO WATT WASN'T DIRTY
AFTER ALL.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.729
- WELL,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

15:08.770 --> 15:10.704
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER,

15:10.740 --> 15:13.231
THE CHIEF WAS
ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.405
- MELBA, WHY ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.179
- I AM NOT NERVOUS.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.872
- IT'S OKAY.
CARUSO CAN'T HURT YOU NOW.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.615
- YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE KEEPING SECRETS

15:23.650 --> 15:25.049
FOR DEAD WHITE GANGSTERS,
SISTER.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.648
LET THAT BIRD FLY.

15:26.690 --> 15:30.182
- [sighs]

15:30.230 --> 15:32.482
MYLES WAS LIKE A BROTHER
TO ME.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.157
- MM-HMM.
- HE WASN'T BEING STRAIGHT

15:34.200 --> 15:37.624
WITH THE CHIEF
BECAUSE HE HAD HIS OWN PROBLEMS.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.228
- WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

15:39.270 --> 15:42.159
- MYLES USED TO HANDLE
CARUSO'S MONEY

15:42.200 --> 15:43.861
FOR HIM FROM TIME TO TIME.

15:43.910 --> 15:48.677
PROBLEM WAS
MYLES LOVED TO GAMBLE.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.074
- FIRST YOU STEAL FROM ME,

15:54.120 --> 15:59.080
AND THEN YOU LIE TO ME.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.418
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU DO
FOR AN ENCORE, MY FRIEND.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.348
[chuckles]

16:03.390 --> 16:05.051
YOU MUST THINK
I AM A DAMN FOOL.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.991
- AH, NO.
- A CLOWN WHO RIDES THE BULL...

16:08.030 --> 16:08.997
- NO.
- AT THE RODEO.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.691
- NO, BOSS.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.493
- PERHAPS ONE
OF THOSE TALL, SKINNY PEOPLE

16:12.530 --> 16:15.897
WITH THE CURLY HAIR WHO PRETEND
TO BE STUCK IN A BOX

16:15.940 --> 16:18.966
OR WALKING AGAINST THE WIND.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.136
- THAT'S A STREET MIME.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.977
- GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON

16:22.010 --> 16:24.501
WHY I SHOULDN'T PUT A BULLET
IN YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.417
- I'M JUST
A HAM-AND-EGGS MAN.

16:27.450 --> 16:30.578
[sobs]

16:30.620 --> 16:33.054
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, BOSS.

16:33.090 --> 16:35.911
IT'S THE CHIPS.
THEY KEEP CALLING ME.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.382
- YOU ARE LUCKY,
MY FRIEND.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.955
LUCKY THAT MY WOMAN
LOVES THE WAY

16:39.990 --> 16:41.651
THAT YOU BRING IN
THE NOISE,

16:41.700 --> 16:46.569
THE WAY
THAT YOU BRING IN THE FUNK.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.465
[laughs]

16:48.500 --> 16:51.139
YOU'RE GOING TO REPAY YOUR DEBT
TO ME AND THEN SOME.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.274
YOU'RE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING I TELL YOU TO DO

16:53.310 --> 16:55.574
EXACTLY WHEN I TELL YOU
TO DO IT.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.100
- SOUNDS LIKE
IT WAS GONNA TAKE

16:57.150 --> 16:59.038
MORE THAN A COUPLE
OF PRIVATE SHOWS TO WORK OFF

16:59.080 --> 17:00.479
VELOUR'S DEBT TO CARUSO.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.215
- [clears throat]

17:02.250 --> 17:03.683
- WHAT'S THAT PICTURE?

17:03.720 --> 17:07.986
- ME, MYLES,
AND PAELLA POWELL.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.750
I SLAPPED THE HELL OUT
OF THAT BITCH ONCE.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.018
- IT'S ALSO
THE SAME TYPE OF CAR

17:12.060 --> 17:12.981
THAT WAS SEEN
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

17:13.030 --> 17:15.089
A SKY BLUE CADILLAC ELDORADO.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.997
- OH, YES, THAT CAR
WAS MYLES' BABY.

17:18.030 --> 17:20.590
- SO MYLES VELOUR
KILLED ARCHIE BAXTER.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.892
- CARUSO MADE HIM
HIS HATCHET MAN.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.635
HE DID IT
TO SAVE HIS OWN SKIN.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.308
- OH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE WAS--

17:26.340 --> 17:29.377
- I SOLVED THE CASE!
I'M GONNA BE CHIEF OF POLICE.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.716
- HEY.
NO, YOU CAN'T JUST GO IN--

17:40.760 --> 17:42.216
- TERRIBLY SORRY
TO INTERRUPT, SIR,

17:42.260 --> 17:45.457
BUT I THINK
YOU ARE GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.752
SERIOUSLY?

17:46.790 --> 17:48.724
JOHN HLAVIN'S A CANDIDATE?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.523
HE'S BEEN COLLECTING DISABILITY
FOR OVER A DECADE,

17:50.570 --> 17:51.298
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN
WALK FUNNY.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.797
- I WAS SHOT IN THE CHEST.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.933
- YOU WROTE A SCREENPLAY
LAST YEAR.

17:53.970 --> 17:55.369
- SO?

17:55.400 --> 17:58.164
- WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM, LASSITER?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.531
YOU HAVE SOME NERVE BARGING IN
ON ME LIKE THIS.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.878
- I KNOW WHO KILLED
YOUR UNCLE, SIR.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.799
- [chuckles]
ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?

18:05.850 --> 18:08.318
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT MYLES VELOUR?

18:08.350 --> 18:10.113
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
THAT I'VE BEEN OBSESSED

18:10.150 --> 18:12.710
WITH MY UNCLE'S CASE
SINCE I WAS A BOY?

18:12.750 --> 18:15.116
THAT I HAVE ALL HIS POSSESSIONS
AT MY HOUSE?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.980
- WELL, THEN, SIR,
YOU KNOW THAT VELOUR WAS

18:17.020 --> 18:20.194
A SPINELESS YES MAN
WITH A GAMBLING ADDICTION.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.993
- WHAT I DO KNOW
IS THAT HE WAS ARRESTED

18:22.030 --> 18:23.566
FOR STARTING A BAR FIGHT

18:23.600 --> 18:25.966
AFTER A SHOW
IN KANSAS CITY

18:26.000 --> 18:27.797
ON THE VERY NIGHT
THAT ARCHIE WAS KILLED.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.661
THAT IS A MATTER
OF PUBLIC RECORD, DETECTIVE.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.873
SO IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT,
I SUGGEST THAT YOU APOLOGIZE

18:33.910 --> 18:37.004
TO ME, TO JOHN,
AND TO AGNES ON THE WAY OUT

18:37.040 --> 18:39.873
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.775
- I AM RIDICULOUSLY SORRY,
SIR.

18:44.050 --> 18:46.985
JOHN.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.215
YOU SOLD A SCRIPT
LAST YEAR, MAN.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.956
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

18:51.990 --> 18:54.891
- [laughs]

18:54.930 --> 18:57.728
- OH, NO,
IT WAS THAT BAD.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.499
HE'S BEEN INCONSOLABLE
SINCE WE GOT BACK.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.192
- SERVES HIM RIGHT.
DUDE WAS ALL OVER THE BROTHER

19:02.240 --> 19:04.208
JUST 'CAUSE HE HAD A BOUFFANT
AND A BLUE CADDY.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.935
- GUS, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.235
- OH, I HONESTLY
HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.947
- HERE'S A QUESTION.
- HMM?

19:13.980 --> 19:16.471
- IS SCARLETT JONES STILL ALIVE?
- BEATS ME.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.509
EASY ENOUGH TO CHECK, THOUGH.
WHY?

19:17.550 --> 19:19.711
- BECAUSE ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE

19:19.750 --> 19:21.308
IS THAT ARCHIE BAXT ER
WAS AFTER SOMEONE

19:21.360 --> 19:23.385
OR SOMETHING IN THIS PICTURE.

19:23.430 --> 19:28.925
AND THAT IS SCARLETT JONES.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.518
- CARLTON, SPLASH SOME WATER
ON YOUR FACE.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.697
WE GOT A NEW LEAD.
- HUH?

19:32.730 --> 19:36.188
- YEP, THAT'S THE ONE.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.231
- YOU SURE?
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.760
- OF COURSE I'M SURE.

19:39.810 --> 19:43.405
I MAY HAVE
THE BOD FOR SIN,

19:43.450 --> 19:46.078
BUT I HAVE THE MEMORY
OF AN ADULT ELEPHANT.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.975
HE WAS OBSESSED
WITH THIS PICTURE.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.614
- DID SHE JUST SAY
SHE HAD A BOD FOR SIN?

19:50.650 --> 19:52.117
- YES.
- SHE NEEDS JESUS.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.015
- [sighs]

19:54.060 --> 19:55.118
CAN I SMOKE?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.082
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.725
- I THINK YOU WANT ME
THE SAME WAY

19:59.760 --> 20:02.092
A LAND TURTLE
WANTS CRAB APPLES.

20:02.130 --> 20:04.792
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTIONS,
PLEASE.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.128
- WELL, WHAT'S IN IT
FOR ME?

20:07.170 --> 20:09.035
- BAXTER WAS ASKING YOU

20:09.070 --> 20:10.935
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND RODNEY,
WASN'T HE?

20:10.970 --> 20:12.403
THE FACT
THAT HALF THE POLICE FORCE

20:12.440 --> 20:14.078
WAS ALREADY ON THE PAYROLL,
RIGHT?

20:14.110 --> 20:15.975
HUH?
RING ANY BELLY-BELLS?

20:16.010 --> 20:17.671
- OH, SUGAR,

20:17.710 --> 20:19.473
IS THAT THE DRAGON
YOU'RE CHASING?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.068
WELL, I HATE TO BURST

20:21.120 --> 20:22.712
YOUR YUMMY LITTLE BUBBLE,

20:22.750 --> 20:26.618
BUT ARCHIE BAXTER
WAS A DEADBEAT DRUNK,

20:26.650 --> 20:27.912
AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING
IN THAT PHOTO

20:27.960 --> 20:32.852
THAT HE WAS AFTER.

20:32.890 --> 20:33.857
- HEY, JONESY.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.299
- YOU AGAIN?

20:35.330 --> 20:37.924
- IT'S OKAY.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.531
- HEY, JONESY.
- WHOO!

20:41.570 --> 20:43.800
- SO DID YOU TALK
TO HER YET?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.307
- HMM?
- DID YOU TALK TO HER?

20:45.340 --> 20:48.173
- OH, DOWN, BOY.
YOUR LIPSTICK'S SHOWING.

20:48.210 --> 20:49.973
- YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA TALK
TO HER FOR ME.

20:50.010 --> 20:51.944
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA PUT IN
A GOOD WORD.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.777
YOU'RE JUST YANKING MY CHAIN.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.913
- NOT FOR ALL THE TEA
IN CHINA.

20:55.950 --> 20:59.579
- OH, JUST LOOK AT HER.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.156
LOOK, CAN'T YOU SEE
RIGHT THERE?

21:01.190 --> 21:02.418
SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:02.460 --> 21:03.950
SHE JUST LOOKS
RIGHT THROUGH ME.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.321
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CARRY

21:05.360 --> 21:06.850
THAT STUPID PHOTO AROUND
WHEN YOU CAN LOOK--

21:06.890 --> 21:08.994
- NO, JONES,
DON'T POINT.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.760
SHE'S GONNA THINK I'M STARING
AT HER LIKE SOME DESPERATE KOOK.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.893
- IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN
FOR YOU, ARCHIE.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.058
LET'S JUST SAY MELBA PREFERS
A SOFTER TOUCH.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.533
STOP TORTURING YOURSELF.
LET ME CALL YOU A CAB.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.434
- I DON'T NEED A CAB.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.801
[stammering]
[thud]

21:24.850 --> 21:25.999
GOD!
[grunts]

21:26.050 --> 21:29.417
GET OFF.
I'M FINE.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.359
- NOW CAN I SMOKE?
- NO.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.483
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THIS WHOLE MURDER CHARADE

21:35.520 --> 21:38.580
IS JUST ABOUT SOME CRUSH
THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.622
- MURDER?
ARCHIE BAXTER WASN'T MURDERED.

21:41.660 --> 21:45.164
HE STUMBLED OUT OF THERE
AND DROVE HIMSELF OFF A CLIFF.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.292
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

21:46.330 --> 21:50.039
NOW IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

21:50.070 --> 21:55.030
OR SHALL WE JUST SKIP
TO DESSERT?

21:55.080 --> 21:58.800
- NO. NO. NO.
UM...

21:58.850 --> 22:00.818
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

22:00.850 --> 22:04.809
JUST A MONUMENTAL WASTE
OF TIME.

22:09.090 --> 22:11.388
- THAT'S WHY MYLES
DIDN'T GET UP ON THAT.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.399
MELBA HAS A THING
FOR THE LADIES.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.250
- I HAVE A WHOLE NEW RESPECT
FOR MELBA TOAST.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.189
COME ON, YOU GUYS,
IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE

22:19.230 --> 22:22.461
AND RESOLVE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
AS AN OLD, BLACK LESBIAN.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.933
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S RIGHT.
- YOU BET YOUR ASS IT DOES.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.039
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- MM-HMM.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.401
- WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?

22:26.440 --> 22:28.305
THERE WAS NO CASE HERE.
THERE NEVER WAS.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.830
- MM.
- I WILL JUST HAVE

22:29.880 --> 22:32.098
TO RELY ON THE STRENGTH
OF MY INTERVIEW

22:32.150 --> 22:34.118
WITH THE MAYOR
AND MY PEOPLE SKILLS.

22:34.150 --> 22:36.675
- OOH.
- I AM SO SCREWED.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.915
- THAT'S NOT OPTIMAL.
- IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT GREAT.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.987
- MM-MM.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.955
- [sighs]

22:48.130 --> 22:49.950
MM.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.292
[snores]

22:54.340 --> 22:56.262
- YOU WAKE UP.
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.234
- YES. YES, WE HAVE TICKETS
TO HOWARD JONES

22:58.270 --> 22:59.999
AT THE SANTA BARBARA BOWL.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.473
GUESS WHO'S OPENING.
I'M GIVING YOU ONE HINT.

23:01.510 --> 23:05.173
- CHIEF VICK ASKED ME
TO BE HER HEAD DETECTIVE.

23:05.210 --> 23:08.111
HOMICIDE, OBVIOUSLY.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.750
- UH...

23:15.790 --> 23:17.189
WOW.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.450
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF CARLTON'S PROMOTED,

23:19.490 --> 23:21.355
I'M LOOKING
AT THE SAME OPPORTUNITY HERE.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.890
YOU WERE RIGHT.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.795
YOU KNOW, HE TOLD ME
AS MUCH ALREADY.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.060
- SEE?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.465
- [sighs]

23:28.500 --> 23:31.037
- PLUS I'M HERE.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.368
- OH, RIGHT.

23:33.410 --> 23:36.299
PLUS YOU'RE HERE.
OF COURSE.

23:36.340 --> 23:39.343
AND, YOU KNOW, THE PAY WILL BE
SO MUCH BETTER HERE

23:39.380 --> 23:41.610
BECAUSE OF TIME SERVED.

23:41.650 --> 23:44.585
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
A NO-BRAINER, WHICH IS WHY,

23:44.620 --> 23:48.078
AS FLATTERING AS IT IS, I'M--
I'M NOT REALLY CONSIDERING IT.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.008
- PLUS, YOU KNOW,
SAN FRANCISCO--

23:50.060 --> 23:55.896
I MEAN, IT'S LITTERED WITH
SHALLOW, ENTITLED 49ER FANS.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.249
UGLY-ON-THE-INSIDE-TYPE PEOPLE.
- RIGHT.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.790
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.765
- YOU DON'T NEED THAT, YOU KNOW.
- RIGHT.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.679
- SIR, YOU CAN'T PARK
YOUR CAR THERE.

24:09.710 --> 24:13.373
- [growling]
CARLTON.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.915
CARL--
[coughing]

24:17.950 --> 24:19.918
CARLTON, COME ON, MAN.
WAKE UP.

24:19.950 --> 24:20.951
[claps]

24:20.990 --> 24:22.218
-HUH?
[gaSPS]

24:22.260 --> 24:23.522
- DON'T BE DUMB.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.118
YOU'RE DREAMING.
I'M A GHOST.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.388
WE HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TIME.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.250
- SORRY.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.528
- AVENGE ME.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.960
I WAS MURDERED.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.319
- YOU DROVE YOURSELF
OFF A CLIFF,

24:33.370 --> 24:34.928
YOU DRUNK, DEGENERATE LUNGER.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.198
- I NEVER HAD A DRINK
IN MY LIFE.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.969
MY NEPHEW TOLD YOU THAT.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.466
EXCEPT FOR THAT NIGHT IN KOREA
WHEN STALIN DIED.

24:39.510 --> 24:41.068
STINKIN' RED.

24:41.110 --> 24:42.998
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,

24:43.040 --> 24:46.077
SCARLETT JONES HAD PLENTY
OF REASONS TO LIE.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.169
COME ON.
THINK ABOUT IT.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.017
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

24:50.050 --> 24:53.486
YOU STAY THE COURSE.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.919
YOU'RE ALL I HAVE.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.919
ADIEU.
ADIEU.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.124
REMEMBER ME.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.696
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

25:04.730 --> 25:06.869
YOU STILL SEE ME?

25:06.900 --> 25:10.131
OH, THERE I GO.

25:10.170 --> 25:13.264
- [gaSPS]

25:17.080 --> 25:19.503
- SHAKE A LEG, STRODE.

25:19.550 --> 25:21.848
SHE WAS LYING, STRODE.
SCARLETT JONES

25:21.880 --> 25:24.587
MUST HAVE BEEN COVERING
FOR BOYFRIEND RODNEY CARUSO

25:24.620 --> 25:26.918
BECAUSE HE LEFT HER EVERYTHING,
AND ANY CASE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM

25:26.950 --> 25:28.383
WOULD HAVE AFFECTED HER
DIRECTLY.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.217
- SO WHO KILLED
ARCHIE BAXTER?

25:30.260 --> 25:31.079
- IF I KNEW THAT, DO YOU THINK
I'D BE STANDING HERE

25:31.130 --> 25:32.324
WITH YOU AT 3:00 A.M.?

25:32.360 --> 25:34.419
NO.
I'M WONDERING SOMETHING.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.121
- YOU'RE WONDERING
IF A WOMAN IN A CAMISOLE

25:36.160 --> 25:37.457
WAS WEARING THIS BEAR'S HEAD

25:37.500 --> 25:39.365
MERE SECONDS
BEFORE YOUR ARRIVAL?

25:39.400 --> 25:42.665
- NO. I'M WONDERING,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE

25:42.700 --> 25:45.760
THAT COULD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR
BAXTER'S LEVEL OF INTOXICATION?

25:45.810 --> 25:47.869
- I ASKED MYSELF
THE VERY SAME QUESTION.

25:47.910 --> 25:50.037
SO I CHECKED LEVELS
OF GAM MA-GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE

25:50.080 --> 25:51.570
IN THE BLOOD,
WHICH, AS YOU KNOW,

25:51.610 --> 25:54.943
IS USUALLY VERY HIGH
IN PEOPLE WHO DRINK.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.811
NOT THE CASE
WITH MR. BAXT ER.

25:56.850 --> 25:59.114
THAT MAN'S LIVER WAS DEAD SEXY,
AND I'M NOT EVEN A LIVER MAN.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.084
I MEAN,
I'M NOT NOT A LIVER MAN.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.486
- SO BAXTER WASN'T DRUNK.
- PROBABLY NOT.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.954
BUT THE LEVEL OF QUINALBARBITONE
IN HIS BLOOD SUGGESTS

26:05.990 --> 26:07.526
THE PRESENCE OF BARBITURATES.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.221
- BARBITU RATES.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.160
HOW THE HELL DID
SLIPPERY DICK MILLER MISS THAT?

26:11.200 --> 26:12.292
- WE PATHOLOGISTS
HAVE COME A LONG WAY

26:12.330 --> 26:13.467
SINCE THE AGE OF AQUARIUS.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.434
- THIS CONFIRMS IT, STRODE.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.267
SCARLETT JONES IS A LIAR,

26:17.300 --> 26:18.665
AND BAXT ER WAS AFTER CARUSO.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.769
I AM SO CLOSE,
I CAN TASTE IT.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.506
- OH, ME TOO.
- I'M GONNA BOUNCE.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.973
THAN KS, STRODE.

26:25.010 --> 26:27.240
- OH, AND, LASSIE,
IF YOU HAPPEN

26:27.280 --> 26:30.078
TO RUN INTO HALF A BEAR
IN THE ALLEY,

26:30.120 --> 26:31.109
DON'T SHOOT IT.

26:31.150 --> 26:33.380
- YOU GOT IT, BUDDY.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.684
- IT'S 6:00 IN THE MORNING,
LASSIE.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.655
- WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING.
- IT'S CALLED SLEEP.

26:38.690 --> 26:39.827
- THIS PLACE IS AS CLOSE
AS WE'RE GONNA GET

26:39.860 --> 26:41.999
TO SOLVING BAXTER'S MURDER.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.622
WE GOTTA KEEP LOOKING.
- WHERE?

26:43.670 --> 26:47.094
- [yawns]

26:47.130 --> 26:51.601
- IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME,
SHAWN.

26:53.340 --> 26:56.332
- FOLLOW ME.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.974
_ GUS!
[gaSPS]

27:07.220 --> 27:10.348
- EVERYBODY IN.

27:10.390 --> 27:12.187
[overlapping exclamations]

27:12.230 --> 27:14.152
EVERYBODY OUT.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.997
- [whimpers]

27:16.030 --> 27:18.760
[drawer opens]

27:20.430 --> 27:22.739
[phone rattles]

27:22.770 --> 27:24.965
[rattling continues]

27:29.040 --> 27:31.144
- [gaSPS]
- BINGO.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.408
- CARUSO'S CALLS
WERE BEING TAPPED.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.872
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
"TAPPED"?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.615
- IF CARUSO'S CALLS
WERE BEING MONITORED,

27:35.650 --> 27:37.015
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE TAPES
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

27:37.050 --> 27:37.789
THIS COULD BE THE BREAK
THAT WE NEED.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.242
- IF ARCHIE'S BEHIND THIS,

27:39.290 --> 27:40.416
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE TO FIND THEM.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.918
COME ON, GANG.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.949
- THAT IS ON TRACK.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.369
- MR. MAYOR, I AM
SO TERRIBLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT--

27:54.400 --> 27:56.630
HE GETS A HOME INTERVIEW?

27:56.670 --> 27:57.739
AND YOU'RE SERVING LEMONADE.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.601
- I'D OFFER YOU A GLASS,

27:59.640 --> 28:01.335
BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY GREAT
WITH LIQUID, ARE YOU?

28:01.380 --> 28:02.938
- [laughs]

28:02.980 --> 28:04.538
- SHUT UP, CANCELOSI.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.878
- ALL RIGHT, MR. MAYOR,

28:06.910 --> 28:09.947
I'M ON THE RECEIVING END
OF SOME VERY SERIOUS VIBES

28:09.980 --> 28:11.686
ABOUT YOUR UNCLE ARCHIE BAXTER,

28:11.720 --> 28:13.017
AND WE JUST NEED
TO TAKE A LOOK

28:13.050 --> 28:14.483
AT SOME
OF HIS PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.680
- DO YOU NOW?

28:15.720 --> 28:17.085
I SEEM TO RECALL YOU HAVING

28:17.120 --> 28:18.826
SOME VERY SERIOUS VIBES
ABOUT ME.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.521
- MM.
- WHICH HAPPENED

28:20.560 --> 28:22.926
TO BE DEAD WRONG
AND ALMOST COST ME MY CANDIDACY.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.360
- GOOD POINT, MR. MAYOR,
BUT I MADE SHAWN PROMISE

28:25.400 --> 28:27.789
NEVER TO MIX POLITICS
AND THE SUPERNATURAL EVER AGAIN.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.637
- YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN PUT
OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE NOW

28:29.670 --> 28:30.659
FOR A COMMON GOAL.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.406
- YEAH.
- WHICH IS WHAT?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.601
- BRINGING JUSTICE TO THE MEMORY
OF ARCHIBALD BAXT ER.

28:34.640 --> 28:38.349
- PLEASE, MR. MAYOR.
INDULGE US JUST THIS ONCE.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.814
WE NEED TO SEE
SOME OF YOUR UNCLE'S BELONGINGS.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.609
- YOU'VE BEEN AWFULLY QUIET
THIS MORNING, SWEETHEART.

28:46.650 --> 28:50.859
LIKE A SILENT NINJA,
WHICH MAKES ME THINK

28:50.890 --> 28:53.484
YOU'RE EITHER PLANNING TO
ASSASSINATE A JAPANESE WARLORD,

28:53.530 --> 28:56.954
OR YOU'RE GIVING
SOME REAL SERIOUS CONSIDERATION

28:57.000 --> 29:00.595
TO TAKING THAT JOB.

29:00.630 --> 29:01.995
- NOPE.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.702
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

29:04.740 --> 29:07.664
SO YOU BETTER HELP SOLVE
THIS CASE IF YOU WANT A HOT TUB.

29:07.710 --> 29:10.304
- ARE YOU SURE?

29:10.340 --> 29:13.138
- SWAGERTY MIGHT BE RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.079
- MYLES VELOUR,
VELOUR DE LUXE VOLUME 1?

29:19.120 --> 29:23.056
WHAT?

29:23.090 --> 29:24.955
- HUH.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.223
WHY ARE THERE TWO OF THOSE?

29:35.600 --> 29:39.400
BECAUSE SOMEONE RECORDED
OVER THIS ONE.

29:48.950 --> 29:51.612
[R&B music playing]

29:51.650 --> 29:55.518
- * MAMA, I'M STANDING
ALL ALONE HERE WITH NOTHING *

29:55.560 --> 29:58.529
* JUST LEAVE ME BE

29:58.560 --> 30:03.452
* AND TURN AROUND

30:03.500 --> 30:06.321
SHH.

30:06.370 --> 30:07.462
-*OOH

30:07.500 --> 30:10.389
- * BABY

30:10.440 --> 30:12.738
* WHAT AM I TO DO

30:12.770 --> 30:15.603
- WHAT THE HELL IS PUCE?
CAN'T WE JUST PAINT IT PURPLE?

30:15.640 --> 30:17.699
- PUCE IS PURPLE, SIR.
- OH, THAT'S FINE.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.879
THEN PAINT THE OFFICE PUCE.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.639
I LIKE PUCE VERY MUCH.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.443
- CARUSO LIKED PUCE.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.040
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE GOT.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.718
[tape fast-forwarding]

30:28.760 --> 30:30.512
- BAXTER CAME AROUND AGAIN.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.982
- THAT'S SCARLETT JONES.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.827
- HE'S ASKING
EVEN MORE QUESTIONS.

30:33.860 --> 30:36.988
- BABY, BABY,
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, GIRL.

30:37.030 --> 30:39.225
HE ASKING ABOUT RODNEY, RIGHT?

30:39.270 --> 30:41.033
- YEAH.
SO FAR.

30:41.070 --> 30:43.459
- THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE AIN'T ONTO US, SUGAR.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.728
AND HE AIN'T NEVER GONNA BE.

30:44.770 --> 30:46.169
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE WE THINKING

30:46.210 --> 30:47.700
BEING OUT SO CLOSE
TO THAT CLUB?

30:47.740 --> 30:49.332
NOW HE'S GOT THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.575
HE'S PROBABLY
ALREADY MADE COPIES.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.942
- OH, BABY, BABY.
- MYLES, MYLES,

30:53.980 --> 30:54.912
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

30:54.950 --> 30:57.942
- HOLY COW.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.447
THE MOBSTER'S MOLL
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

31:00.490 --> 31:02.617
WITH THE COCOA CROONER.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.481
- THIS PROBLEM OF OURS
ISN'T GONNA GO AWAY

31:07.530 --> 31:09.020
ON ITS OWN, SUGAR.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.755
- I SMELL WHAT YOU'RE
COOKING NOW, JELLYBEAN,

31:10.800 --> 31:13.394
BUT I CAN'T GET CAUGHT
WITH MY CAT IN THE CRADLE.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.534
- JUST SLIP ME YOUR KEYS
AT THE CLUB TONIGHT.

31:15.570 --> 31:16.696
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT
LIKE I TAKE CARE

31:16.740 --> 31:17.661
OF EVERYTHING ELSE
AROUND HERE.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.861
[tape stops]

31:19.910 --> 31:21.377
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.638
- WHILE TRYING
TO UNCOVER CORRUPTION

31:22.680 --> 31:24.409
WITHIN THE SBPD,
ARCHIE STUMBLED

31:24.450 --> 31:26.475
UPON A SECRET THAT EVEN
HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.842
CARUSO'S LADY WAS MAKING
NIGHTTIME NOISES

31:28.880 --> 31:30.040
WITH THE COCOA CROONER.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.980
- SINCE WHEN
DOES HE SAY COCOA?

31:32.020 --> 31:33.954
- IF CARUSO GOT WIND OF
THE AFFAIR, HE'D KILL THEM BOTH.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.185
AND SCARLETT KNEW
THAT ARCHIE HAD A PICTURE

31:36.220 --> 31:39.087
PROVING THAT THEIR HANDS
WERE BOTH UP IN THE COOKIE JAR.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.325
- HE'S IN SOME KIND OF ZONE.

31:41.360 --> 31:45.069
- SCARLETT JONES
DRUGGED ARCHIE.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.839
SHE TAILED HIM
OUT OF THE LIMELIGHTER,

31:49.870 --> 31:51.838
KNOWING THAT HIS FACULTIES
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISED.

31:51.870 --> 31:54.407
[tires screech]

31:56.140 --> 31:58.643
AND THEN
LIKE A LADY BLONDE SHE-VIPER,

31:58.680 --> 32:01.148
SHE STRUCK WHEN HE WAS
AT HIS MOST VULNERABLE.

32:03.950 --> 32:06.680
[collision,
tires screeching]

32:09.320 --> 32:10.685
[collision]

32:12.230 --> 32:15.859
[crash]

32:15.900 --> 32:18.562
[splash]
INTO A WATERY GRAVE HE WENT.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.364
[tires screech]

32:21.400 --> 32:22.264
- WATERY GRAVE'S
A NICE FLOURISH.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.700
- MM, IT'S DECENT AT BEST.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.958
- SURE, MAYBE ARCHIE BAXT ER
ENDED UP BEING PARTIALLY EATEN

32:27.010 --> 32:29.205
BY FRESHWATER EELS,
BUT IT WASN'T TWO WEEKS LATER

32:29.240 --> 32:31.947
THAT CHIEF OLSON WATT
USED YOUR UNCLE'S FINDINGS

32:31.980 --> 32:35.438
AS THE BASIS TO CALL IN THE FEDS
WHO THEN SWEPT ORGANIZED CRIME

32:35.480 --> 32:36.970
OUT OF OUR BELOVED SANTA BARBARA
FOR GOOD.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.113
- WHY DIDN'T WATT
TELL ANYONE THE TRUTH?

32:39.150 --> 32:40.447
- WELL, WHEN THE FEDS
TOOK OVER THE INVESTIGATION,

32:40.490 --> 32:42.185
THEY PUT A GAG ORDER
ON WATT.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.155
HE GAVE HIS TESTIMONY IN COURT,
BUT THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.158
I'M SURE IT WAS
VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM.

32:47.190 --> 32:48.452
- HE DIED NOT LONG
AFTER THE COURT CASE.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.899
- YEAH.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.659
- I'M SURE IT HAUNTS HIM
IN HIS GRAVE.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.520
- I THINK
WE'RE DIGRESSING HERE.

32:53.570 --> 32:54.434
- WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?
- WATT'S EMOTIONS?

32:54.470 --> 32:55.459
- NO ONE CARES.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.990
- AS I WAS SAYING, TOM,

32:57.040 --> 32:58.928
I'M A SCRATCH GOLFER,
AND YOU'RE WELCOME

32:58.970 --> 33:00.961
TO TAKE THE TESLA
FOR A SPIN ANYTIME.

33:01.010 --> 33:02.602
- SAVE IT, JIM.
WE'RE FINISHED HERE, OKAY?

33:02.640 --> 33:05.074
- CRAP.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.203
- LASSITER,

33:07.250 --> 33:08.615
I WANT TO SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.447
WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.938
[heroic music]

33:13.990 --> 33:15.457
I WON'T MINCE WORDS,
DETECTIVE.

33:15.490 --> 33:16.855
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD THE STONES.

33:16.890 --> 33:18.448
SURE, YOU HAVE
AN ADMIRABLE RECORD,

33:18.490 --> 33:19.957
AND YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOREVER AND A DAY,

33:19.990 --> 33:21.821
BUT I WAS LOOKING
FOR THAT CERTAIN "IT" FACTOR,

33:21.860 --> 33:23.828
WHICH YOU SIMPLY
HAVEN'T EXUDED.

33:23.860 --> 33:26.761
EVER.
UNTIL YESTERDAY.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.131
SURE, YOU WERE PULLING
MOST OF YOUR LEADS

33:28.170 --> 33:29.865
STRAIGHT OUT OF YOUR RUMPUS,

33:29.900 --> 33:32.039
BUT ONCE THE SMOKE CLEARED,
YOU BROUGHT ME

33:32.070 --> 33:33.628
AND WHAT'S LEFT
OF MY CRAPPY FAMILY

33:33.670 --> 33:36.070
SOME MUCH NEEDED
AND SERIOUS CLOSURE.

33:36.110 --> 33:37.737
FOR THAT, I'M--

33:37.780 --> 33:40.601
[chuckles]
WELL, JUST COLOR ME GRATEFUL.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.711
PLEASE,
DETECTIVE LASSITER,

33:44.750 --> 33:48.914
HAVE SOME LEMON WATER.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.916
- THANK YOU, SIR.
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.020
AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT
THAT SCALY TEMPTRESS

33:54.060 --> 33:55.527
SCARLETT JONES
WILL BE PROSECUTED

33:55.560 --> 33:57.699
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
OF THE LAW.

33:57.730 --> 33:58.890
- GREAT.

33:58.930 --> 34:00.761
SO LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.234
YOU'RE MY NEW CHIEF.
CONGRATS.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.807
AND DON'T GET COCKY ON ME.

34:07.970 --> 34:10.109
- THANK YOU, SIR.

34:10.140 --> 34:12.847
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.313
- OH, I THINK I DO.
- AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,

34:14.350 --> 34:16.215
WITH THE TEAM
I'VE ALREADY ASSEMBLED ON PAPER,

34:16.250 --> 34:17.740
THE FUTURE OF THIS CITY--
- EASY THERE, TIGER.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.680
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
LAYING THE LAND.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.608
HAVE A SEAT.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.810
THERE ARE CONDITIONS.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.078
AND BELIEVE YOU ME,
THESE CONDITIONS ARE IN PLACE

34:26.130 --> 34:28.655
FOR YOUR OWN DAMN GOOD.

34:31.630 --> 34:37.569
[applause]

34:50.280 --> 34:52.214
- AFTERNOON, O'HARA.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.856
- GOOD AFTERNOON, CHIEF.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.261
THAT WAS QUITE AN ENTRANCE.

35:05.300 --> 35:10.135
- THAT WAS UNEXPECT ED,
BUT NOT UNAPPRECIATED.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.661
- YOU HAVE LONG SINCE EARNED
THEIR RESPECT AND ADMIRATION,

35:12.710 --> 35:14.268
JUST IN CASE
YOU WERE WONDERING.

35:14.310 --> 35:17.700
- THANKS.
- SO HOW DOES IT FEEL?

35:17.740 --> 35:20.948
AND WHY AREN'T YOU
AT YOUR DESK?

35:20.980 --> 35:23.141
IN YOUR CHAIR?

35:23.180 --> 35:25.011
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.

35:25.050 --> 35:27.518
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

35:31.090 --> 35:36.494
- [imitates phone ringing]

35:39.900 --> 35:41.834
- LASSITER.
- AH EM.

35:41.870 --> 35:42.962
- CHIEF LASSITER.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.092
- [squeals]

35:44.140 --> 35:45.801
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.230
I ADMIT
IT FEELS PRETTY GOOD.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.248
- OH, PRETTY GOOD?
WELL, TRY AGAIN.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.305
[imitates phone ringing]

35:53.350 --> 35:56.649
- FEELS LIKE
A DAMN BUREAUCRATIC SCREW JOB,

35:56.680 --> 35:57.840
IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.587
DEDICATE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

36:00.620 --> 36:03.009
TO ONE THING
THAT REALLY MATTERS.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.324
THEN THEY TELL YOU
YOU'VE GOT TO--

36:05.360 --> 36:07.282
- CARLTON, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

36:07.330 --> 36:08.922
'CAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF
FREAKING ME OUT A LITTLE.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.292
- IT'S NO GOOD, O'HARA.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.696
I CAN'T SIT BEHIND THAT DESK
AND PRETEND THAT I DON'T WANT

36:13.730 --> 36:15.129
TO BE OUT THERE WITH YOU

36:15.170 --> 36:16.899
WATCHING EACH OTHER'S BACKS

36:16.940 --> 36:20.137
AND RAIDING
SOME PSYCHOPATH'S DEN OF DEATH.

36:20.170 --> 36:22.502
- CARLTON!
- I SAID IT'S NO GOOD.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.132
- IT'S YOUR LIFELONG DREAM.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.876
YOU READ YOUR MOTHER
HER MIRANDA RIGHTS

36:26.910 --> 36:29.014
AT SEVEN YEARS OLD
FOR PARKING IN A LOADING ZONE.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.813
DO YOU REMEMBER
TELLING ME THAT?

36:30.850 --> 36:32.442
NOW YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY

36:32.490 --> 36:35.687
GETTING COLD FEET
ABOUT ACCEPTING YOUR BIRTHRIGHT.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.826
- SWAGERTY WON'T LET ME
KEEP YOU.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.653
- I SEE.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.292
- SELF-RIGHTEOUS SON OF A BITCH
IS FLANKING ME

36:44.330 --> 36:46.423
WITH ALL HIS OWN PEOPLE.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.768
LIKE I NEED PROPPING UP.
SAYS IT'S FOR MY OWN GOOD,

36:48.800 --> 36:53.965
THAT I LACK EXPERIENCE
IN AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY.

36:54.010 --> 36:57.036
HE TOLD ME TO TAKE IT
OR LEAVE IT.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.071
YOU'RE GONNA BE TRANSFERRED.

36:59.110 --> 37:00.668
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.508
- YOU'RE STILL
THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.711
- WHAT'S IT WORTH?
YOU'VE NEVER LEFT ME OUT THERE,

37:05.750 --> 37:06.978
NOT FOR ONE DAY.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.079
- YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.452
- NO, I DON'T.
YOU'RE STILL MY SUBORDINATE,

37:11.490 --> 37:12.821
SO YOU LISTEN TO ME.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.055
WE HAVE SPENT EIGHT LONG YEARS

37:15.100 --> 37:16.920
PUTTING OUR LIVES
IN EACH OTHER'S HANDS.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.394
I HAVE WATCHED YOU FIGHT.
I HAVE WATCHED YOU ALMOST DIE.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.193
- BUT YOU DIDN'T LET ME.

37:21.230 --> 37:25.132
- THAT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

37:25.170 --> 37:28.276
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.938
YOU'VE BEEN SO MUCH MORE
THAN A PARTNER.

37:30.980 --> 37:34.040
YOU'RE MY CONFIDANTE.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.140
YOU'VE SHOWED ME
IMMEASURABLE PATIENCE

37:37.180 --> 37:40.513
AND LOYALTY.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.256
YOU ARE VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME,

37:42.290 --> 37:44.850
JULIET,
AND I DON'T ALWAYS

37:44.890 --> 37:49.395
DO A REALLY GREAT JOB
OF LETTING YOU KNOW THAT.

37:49.430 --> 37:52.922
SO I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.858
AND YOU DESERVE TO BE
THIS DEPARTMENT'S HEAD DETECTIVE

37:54.900 --> 37:56.936
JUST AS MUCH AS I DESERVE
TO BE ITS CHIEF.

37:56.970 --> 38:00.929
AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT
WITHOUT YOU.

38:00.970 --> 38:04.303
SO I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.944
- ME TOO.

38:06.980 --> 38:10.768
YOU INSPIRE ME, PARTNER.
ALWAYS HAVE.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.948
YOU HAVE BELIEVED IN ME
SINCE DAY ONE.

38:13.990 --> 38:17.255
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME COURAGE
AND STRENGTH

38:17.290 --> 38:19.349
AND TAUGHT ME ACCOUNTABILITY

38:19.390 --> 38:21.950
AND HOW TO RATION MY AMMO IN THE
EVENT OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.752
- YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THAT.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.394
- YOU HAVE A FAMILY
TO THINK ABOUT NOW.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.536
IT'S TIME TO TURN
THE PAGE, CARLTON.

38:29.570 --> 38:31.936
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST KNOWING YOU WOULD MAKE

38:31.970 --> 38:33.699
THAT SACRIFICE FOR ME
GIVES ME...

38:33.740 --> 38:35.401
[claps chest]

38:35.440 --> 38:37.431
ALL THE CLARITY I NEED.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.402
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:39.450 --> 38:43.079
- EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.681
I'M GOING WITH KAREN.

38:46.720 --> 38:51.157
AND YOU ARE GONNA BE CHIEF.

38:51.190 --> 38:54.728
AND IT IS ALL
GONNA BE OKAY.

38:54.760 --> 38:58.526
[laughing]

39:07.970 --> 39:10.006
- OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO GO,
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.702
YOU HAVE TO GO,
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA DO

39:12.750 --> 39:15.469
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
- WILL WE?

39:15.520 --> 39:18.114
MAYBE YOU DON'T COME
TO SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT AWAY.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.118
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU STAY HERE AND--

39:20.150 --> 39:22.516
AND SORT OUT STUFF.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.881
YOU KNOW, I'LL NEED
TO GET SETTLED ANYWAY,

39:24.930 --> 39:26.488
AND IT'S JUST FIVE HOURS
UP THE INTERSTATE, SO...

39:26.530 --> 39:28.122
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.388
IT BARELY QUALIFIES
AS LONG-DISTANCE.

39:29.430 --> 39:31.057
I MEAN, LET'S BE REAL.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.590
I COULD RUN TO YOU
IN, LIKE, HALF A DAY.

39:32.630 --> 39:34.439
- WELL, I MEAN,
MAYBE IF YOU WERE A TRAIN.

39:34.470 --> 39:37.098
- WELL, YOU SHOULD
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE MY CABOOSE.

39:37.140 --> 39:41.736
- [sighs]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:41.780 --> 39:42.838
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE
TOMORROW?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.643
- WHAT?
- I'LL DRIVE MYSELF.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.648
- OH, COME ON. NO WAY.
- YOU SLEEP IN. YES WAY.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.341
SHAWN, I JUST THRUST THIS
ON YOU

39:48.380 --> 39:51.178
WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING
YOUR SITUATION.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.812
I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

39:52.850 --> 39:54.613
- BUT HE'LL BE FINE.
HE HAS A TV.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.615
- I WANT YOU TO COME

39:55.660 --> 39:58.788
TO SAN FRANCISCO, I DO.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.388
WHEN YOU'RE READY.
OKAY?

40:00.430 --> 40:03.354
COME WHEN YOU'RE READY.
THAT IS FAIR, RIGHT?

40:03.400 --> 40:04.992
AND REASONABLE?
THAT'S REASONABLE?

40:05.030 --> 40:06.463
CAN YOU FEEL ME
BEING REASONABLE?

40:06.500 --> 40:09.389
BECAUSE I AM KIND OF
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.237
- HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME OVER HERE.

40:11.270 --> 40:14.262
COME LAY NEXT TO MY BODY
RIGHT HERE.

40:14.310 --> 40:17.108
PUT THE REST OF
YOUR GRAY PANTSUITS IN THE BAG,

40:17.140 --> 40:18.175
AND THEN COME LAY DOWN.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.472
- THEY'RE NOT ALL GRAY.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.000
- THEY ARE MOSTLY GRAY,

40:21.050 --> 40:22.369
AND THEY'RE MONEY,
AND I LOVE THEM.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.741
AND I ALWAYS HAVE.
AND I LOVE YOU.

40:40.300 --> 40:42.495
- OH, THE ALARM IS GONNA GO OFF
SO EARLY.

40:42.540 --> 40:46.135
- THERE'S 0% CHANCE
THAT I'M GONNA HEAR THAT,

40:46.170 --> 40:48.138
SO YOU HAVE TO SHAKE ME HARD,
YOU KNOW.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.638
- OKAY.
- AND I'LL HELP YOU CARRY

40:50.680 --> 40:52.238
YOUR STUFF DOWN.
- OKAY.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.511
- THAT BAG IN THE CORNER
IS, LIKE, 700 POUNDS.

40:55.550 --> 40:57.177
- IT'S GONNA BE 4:30, SHAWN.

40:57.220 --> 41:00.610
- GONNA HAVE
TO PLAY THAT BY EAR.

41:08.130 --> 41:11.054
WE'RE GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.268
- OKAY.

41:15.300 --> 41:18.531
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

41:18.570 --> 41:21.733
[soft music]

41:21.780 --> 41:29.710
