00:00.102 --> 00:01.835
<i>Previously, on "Queen of Jordan..."</i>

00:02.102 --> 00:03.735
Don't tell me I can't sing.

00:03.804 --> 00:06.339
What the [Bleep]
have you ever done?

00:06.407 --> 00:09.359
Who the [Bleep]
are the Beatles?

00:09.443 --> 00:10.810
[Gasps]

00:10.861 --> 00:12.144
I know what you said
about me.

00:12.196 --> 00:14.497
Please. I don't even think
about you.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.332
You're nothing.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.334
I know the photo shoot
for Randi's dog's funeral

00:18.419 --> 00:19.853
is the wrong place
to tell you this,

00:19.920 --> 00:24.090
but I'm going to Africa.

00:24.158 --> 00:28.094
It's my way till payday.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.520
D'Fwan,
glue in the business weave.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.272
I have an important meeting
with Jack Donaghy

00:39.340 --> 00:41.975
from NBC today.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.343
D'Fwan forgot
his catchphrase.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.732
[Bell dings]

00:49.817 --> 00:51.818
Since Tracy
is off helping people in Africa,

00:51.869 --> 00:55.355
I finally have a chance
to focus on me.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.323
That is why I'm launching
my music career.

00:57.374 --> 00:58.858
It has been my dream
to be a singer

00:58.926 --> 01:00.426
ever since I was a little...

01:00.494 --> 01:02.962
drunk the other day and
rented out a recording space.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.135
Oh, Angie, thank you
for coming in.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.337
NBC could not be happier...

01:11.405 --> 01:12.922
About <i>Queen of Jordan.</i>

01:13.007 --> 01:14.373
For the first time
in six months,

01:14.425 --> 01:15.842
we beat all the music
choice channels

01:15.893 --> 01:17.977
except, of course,
Latin Beats.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.113
Well, Angie's thinking
of the next move now.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.248
As you know, my single
"My Single is Dropping"

01:22.316 --> 01:24.050
- is dropping.
- What's happening?

01:24.118 --> 01:25.852
My single is called
"My Single is Dropping"

01:25.903 --> 01:26.853
and it's dropping.

01:26.904 --> 01:27.987
Angie,
"My Single is Dropping"

01:28.055 --> 01:28.988
is the reason I wanted

01:29.056 --> 01:30.290
the three of us to meet.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.191
With Tracy gone,
<i>TGS</i> will be airing

01:32.259 --> 01:33.610
another "Best of" Special.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.561
Actually, legal says
we can't use the word "best."

01:35.613 --> 01:36.963
Either way,
the studio is free,

01:37.031 --> 01:38.781
so I thought we would have
your release party there.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.733
You would perform
and Lemon here

01:40.801 --> 01:41.834
will help you put it
together.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.136
What? No. I thought
we were here

01:43.203 --> 01:45.622
to talk about getting Tracy
back from Africa.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.341
Look, I love Tracy.
But he is work.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.411
Angie, look what the banister
did to me!

01:51.478 --> 01:53.079
Do know how much of my time
he wastes?

01:53.130 --> 01:55.982
- Let's role play.
- Tracy, we're gonna be late!

01:56.050 --> 01:58.985
[Door closes]
Our boat exploded.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.588
With Tracy away, it's time
to let Angie be the star.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.273
I hope Tracy doesn't come home
for months.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.525
Months? No. We can't make it
that long without Tracy.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.360
- You can't do this!
- Are you giving me orders?

02:07.427 --> 02:08.610
Am I the waiter?

02:08.696 --> 02:10.145
Is this the restaurant
that I'm opening up

02:10.229 --> 02:11.814
with Dennis Rodman
and Webster?

02:11.899 --> 02:15.601
No. I just thought
you would be on my side.

02:15.653 --> 02:18.454
"Yes, we can."
Obama '08, remember?

02:18.539 --> 02:21.324
Look,
this is a very complic...

02:21.408 --> 02:23.710
- Oh!
- Oh!

02:23.777 --> 02:26.462
As an executive of Kabletown
and NBC Universal

02:26.547 --> 02:30.083
I am ordering you
not to use that footage.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.885
John Francis Donaghy.
Verbal signature.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.423
Angie's single release party
is tomorrow night.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.692
It seems like the perfect place
for me to reveal

02:39.760 --> 02:41.828
my shocking, secret past.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.813
No, we're not writing
a tearful admission

02:43.897 --> 02:46.232
about you being a call girl
in Delaware.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.300
Write it yourself.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.634
For your information,

02:48.686 --> 02:51.137
I am a Christian illiterate,
so that's not an option.

02:51.188 --> 02:52.855
You know what,
I'm not getting sucked

02:52.940 --> 02:54.841
into your crazy
reality show nonsense.

02:54.908 --> 02:59.495
Liz, I'm so mad at you
for that thing you did.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.847
Am I trying
to instigate fights

03:00.914 --> 03:03.716
by throwing wine at people
just to get on camera

03:03.784 --> 03:06.586
and maybe also promote my new
lifestyle web site:

03:06.654 --> 03:09.155
Jennas-side.com?

03:09.206 --> 03:10.823
Of course not.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.659
I mean, is wine throwing
something that even gets you

03:12.726 --> 03:14.060
on a reality show?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.768
God, Jenna, I told you
not to buy that domain name.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.688
- Say it out loud.
- Jennas-side... Genocide.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.939
I'm not hearing it, Liz.

03:30.561 --> 03:31.978
Hey, guess who's getting out
of jail.

03:32.029 --> 03:35.882
I don't know. But I hope
they didn't collect $200.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.418
Lynn Onkman.
Remember her?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.019
Oh, sure,
that hot teacher from Queens

03:40.087 --> 03:41.354
who had an affair
with her student.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.223
Oh, my God.
Check out this picture.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.042
Frank, is that you?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.362
You never said
you were in Lynn Onkman's class.

03:50.414 --> 03:52.398
- Sure, I did.
- What?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.217
Do you know the kid
she had an affair with?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.636
No. Yes. I don't know.
Shut up.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.921
- It was you.
- I don't want to talk about it.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.440
Well done, sir.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.309
Guys, a teacher preying
on a student is wrong...

04:03.377 --> 04:04.644
Yeah.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.579
If the teacher is male
and the student is female.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.715
What happened to Frank
is awesome.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.718
- Standing ovation.
- You don't understand!

04:11.785 --> 04:13.903
It was love!
We were in love!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.994
I need to look good
for my party.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.963
And I refuse to wear anything
in my size

04:24.031 --> 04:26.099
or appropriate for my age.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.751
Lemon, a word.

Ham.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.657
Wow.
If only Tracy were here,

05:41.742 --> 05:43.142
he'd be, like, "Damn, woman,

05:43.193 --> 05:45.077
"I want to make love
to your neck."

05:45.145 --> 05:46.979
Don't do impressions
of other races.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.831
Roger that, Angie.

06:03.545 --> 06:05.662
<i> I'm in charge of</i>
<i>setting up for Angie's party.</i>

06:05.714 --> 06:07.464
'Cause I'm not just
a gay hairdresser.

06:07.532 --> 06:09.666
I'm also a homosexual
party planner.

06:09.734 --> 06:12.836
Mr. D'Fwan,
Party City does not sell

06:12.904 --> 06:15.906
giant see-through clocks
or strap-on Pegasus wings,

06:15.974 --> 06:18.909
so I got this paper pineapple
instead.

06:18.977 --> 06:20.944
Hey, girlfriends.

06:21.012 --> 06:22.229
Why don't we all have
some drinks

06:22.313 --> 06:25.916
and talk about
how I think Portia has no class.

06:25.984 --> 06:28.402
- Yeah, you heard me, Portia.
- Uh-uh.

06:28.486 --> 06:30.738
I will not be in the same room
as that woman.

06:30.805 --> 06:33.741
Is this about what happened
in Atlantic city?

06:33.825 --> 06:35.292
- I didn't say it.
- You did.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.794
- You did.
- I didn't say it.

06:36.861 --> 06:38.746
- I didn't say it!
- You did!

06:38.830 --> 06:41.415
- I didn't say it.
- You did.

06:41.499 --> 06:46.503
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Francis Rossitano.

06:46.554 --> 06:49.556
Oh, snap.
That's Lynn Onkman.

06:49.641 --> 06:51.208
Portia reads the papers.

06:58.049 --> 07:00.651
- Mrs. Onkman?
- Frank R?

07:00.718 --> 07:02.753
Yeah.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.627
Michael.
Are you back on meth?

07:10.695 --> 07:12.329
- Mm-hmm.
No. Why? You got some?

07:12.397 --> 07:16.066
Think fast.
[Laughs]

07:16.117 --> 07:18.268
Nice catch, dotcom.

07:18.336 --> 07:21.455
I'm sick of being disrespected
by that man.

07:21.539 --> 07:22.673
<i>Sick</i> of it.

07:22.740 --> 07:26.243
Yeah. I was an athlete.
Very graceful.

07:26.311 --> 07:28.979
Sports stories?
I got some.

07:29.047 --> 07:30.481
Uh, I'm meeting my friend Greg
for lunch.

07:30.548 --> 07:31.465
Again?

07:31.549 --> 07:32.549
When I was at Princeton,

07:32.600 --> 07:34.384
I played baseball
and football.

07:34.435 --> 07:37.287
And back then,
football players went both ways.

07:37.355 --> 07:40.924
Really?
So you went both ways?

07:40.992 --> 07:44.778
Yeah. We all did.
It was the '70s.

07:44.863 --> 07:48.031
So when you played baseball,
were you ever on the DL?

07:48.099 --> 07:50.934
Yeah. I was on the DL
most of my junior year.

07:51.002 --> 07:53.620
Mm.
DL can mean "disabled list."

07:53.705 --> 07:56.907
But it can also mean
"down low" or "secretly gay."

07:56.975 --> 07:58.809
Which one
was Jack talking about?

07:58.877 --> 08:00.010
When we were on the DL,

08:00.078 --> 08:02.112
we spent most of our time
in the whirlpool

08:02.180 --> 08:03.213
getting rubbed down.

08:03.281 --> 08:04.447
You were a switch-hitter?

08:04.499 --> 08:07.317
Switch-hitter.
Pitcher. Catcher.

08:07.385 --> 08:10.337
Whatever the boys needed.

08:10.421 --> 08:12.456
I think I made my point.

08:15.310 --> 08:18.228
I drank
all the throwing wine

08:18.296 --> 08:21.331
and I have something
to say to Portia.

08:21.399 --> 08:23.851
I know what you said
about me.

08:23.935 --> 08:26.403
Good. Because I'm concerned
about you.

08:26.470 --> 08:29.740
Even though we just met,
I can tell you're an alcoholic.

08:29.807 --> 08:33.309
Come on, Portia.
I want to fight.

08:33.378 --> 08:37.414
I have battled my own demons
and you need help.

08:37.481 --> 08:40.250
No. I don't need
any help.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.587
I am in denial
about my disease.

08:43.654 --> 08:48.675
And I don't know
what would change that.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.261
Drunk actor brainstorm.

08:51.329 --> 08:55.048
I'm going to make Pete host
an intervention for me.

08:55.133 --> 08:58.385
It'll be all about Jenna.
Drama. Crying.

08:58.469 --> 09:02.339
The beauty of redemption.
Perhaps a song.

09:02.390 --> 09:03.840
This is the best day
of my life.

09:03.908 --> 09:06.276
[Knocking at door]
I'm sorry.

09:06.344 --> 09:07.611
You want me
to perform in this?

09:07.678 --> 09:10.280
Yeah. You're Amy Grant
from the "Baby Baby" video.

09:10.348 --> 09:12.232
The one where the man likes her
at the Carnival.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.784
That's some white nonsense.

09:13.851 --> 09:15.352
Too bad Tracy's not here
to take your side.

09:15.403 --> 09:17.020
He'd be, like, "Damn you,
Liz Lemon."

09:17.071 --> 09:19.056
We discussed this,
Elizabeth.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.358
Yes. Uh, anyway,
I've got the auditions

09:21.409 --> 09:23.193
for your backup dancers.

09:23.244 --> 09:25.045
Good. 'Cause I'm looking
for dancers who can dance

09:25.129 --> 09:29.433
for 15 seconds 'cause that's
how long my song is.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.368
What?
That's my wedding video.

09:31.436 --> 09:34.204
Oh, no. I must've mixed up
the DVD discs.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.139
Agh! Well, we'll just have
to watch it anyway

09:36.207 --> 09:39.009
- and see what feelings arise.
- Angie, just start!

09:39.060 --> 09:40.677
[Police siren blares]

09:40.728 --> 09:42.346
Are you wearing handcuffs,
Tracy?

09:42.397 --> 09:44.514
Can my friend cheese
come with us on our honeymoon?

09:44.565 --> 09:46.566
What?

09:46.651 --> 09:48.652
Okay, I should've watched
that first.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.554
Do you see how exhausting
that man can be?

09:50.622 --> 09:51.721
Yes. He has his flaws.

09:51.773 --> 09:53.573
But I know
you two love each other.

09:53.658 --> 09:54.691
Yeah. And with him gone,

09:54.742 --> 09:56.109
our relationship
has never been better.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.595
So he can stay in Africa
for as long as he wants.

09:58.663 --> 10:01.915
I'm on Angie time now.

10:03.968 --> 10:06.903
Frank and Lynn's story
really moved me.

10:06.971 --> 10:08.572
So I let them have
their reunion date

10:08.640 --> 10:11.074
at the Stripaerobics Studio
I bought with the money I got

10:11.142 --> 10:12.843
after that cop shot me.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.978
What else did you miss
in prison?

10:15.046 --> 10:16.480
Oh, they kept remaking
<i>The Hulk</i>

10:16.547 --> 10:17.814
and it kept getting worse.

10:17.882 --> 10:20.050
[Laughs] Could we talk
about something

10:20.101 --> 10:21.852
other than comic book movies?

10:21.919 --> 10:25.422
Sure.
Yeah, uh...

10:25.490 --> 10:29.760
I thought about you a lot
while I was away.

10:29.827 --> 10:33.764
And I still remember
the... the moment

10:33.831 --> 10:35.599
when we fell in love.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.468
You were administering
a scoliosis test to the class

10:38.536 --> 10:41.455
and you lingered on my spine.

10:41.539 --> 10:44.308
Frank,
why did you bring me here?

10:44.375 --> 10:46.943
And who's that woman?

10:46.995 --> 10:49.162
A friend. Continue.

10:49.247 --> 10:51.448
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
bring you to my place.

10:51.516 --> 10:54.384
My mom's there and she still
wants you to rot in hell.

10:54.452 --> 10:56.353
You live with your mother?

10:56.421 --> 11:00.324
Yeah. Otherwise who would
wake me up for work?

11:00.391 --> 11:01.992
- What's wrong?
[Sighs] - Oh, Frank.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.661
The boy I fell in love with

11:04.729 --> 11:07.297
was the most amazing
eighth-grader

11:07.365 --> 11:09.149
that I've ever met.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.767
And I couldn't wait
to meet the man

11:10.835 --> 11:13.970
that that boy became,
but you haven't grown.

11:14.038 --> 11:16.023
You're still talking
about superheroes

11:16.107 --> 11:18.859
and video games
and why Seth Logan

11:18.943 --> 11:20.810
shouldn't have played
the green something.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.546
Hornet. Yeah.
And it's Rogen.

11:22.613 --> 11:24.314
It's like you're stuck.

11:24.365 --> 11:25.849
Oh.
I wonder why I'm stuck.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.984
What could've happened
to me when I was 14

11:28.052 --> 11:29.586
to make me never want
to grow up?

11:29.653 --> 11:30.787
Inside voice, Frank.

11:30.838 --> 11:32.339
And I refuse to take
the blame for that.

11:32.423 --> 11:35.258
I lost everything
to be with you.

11:35.326 --> 11:37.327
Well, this is who I am.

11:37.395 --> 11:40.063
If you don't like it
then what's the point?

11:40.131 --> 11:44.501
Now may I be dismissed?
Okay.

11:51.726 --> 11:54.845
I thought this was a meeting
to discuss your spinoff

11:54.912 --> 11:57.547
where you do matchmaking
for wealthy dogs.

11:57.615 --> 11:59.716
I lied.

11:59.784 --> 12:02.953
D'Fwan thinks that maybe you're
not being true to your you.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.955
I know what it's like
to live a lie.

12:05.022 --> 12:07.157
I used to be in the military.

12:07.225 --> 12:09.092
But I was unfairly thrown out
because I went berserk

12:09.160 --> 12:11.361
around all those dudes
and tried to bang everybody.

12:12.429 --> 12:13.630
It has come to my attention

12:13.698 --> 12:15.582
that some of what I said
yesterday

12:15.666 --> 12:17.634
may have been misconstrued.

12:17.702 --> 12:19.236
"Going both ways"
in football

12:19.303 --> 12:22.506
means playing offense
and defense.

12:22.573 --> 12:25.609
And there is nothing gay
about the Princeton fight song.

12:25.676 --> 12:29.679
♪ Oh, the merry men of Princeton
are charging up the rear ♪

12:29.747 --> 12:32.482
♪ holding all the balls... ♪
okay, I hear it now.

12:32.550 --> 12:36.069
Regardless,
I'm not gay or clumsy.

12:36.154 --> 12:39.222
So your little show has nothing
with which to embarrass me.

12:39.273 --> 12:42.125
[Chair squeaks]
That was the chair.

12:42.193 --> 12:44.394
Here. I'll show you.

12:44.462 --> 12:50.233
[Silence]

12:50.284 --> 12:52.302
It was the chair.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.474
What is this?

12:57.542 --> 12:59.943
Jenna, everyone here
loves you very much.

13:00.011 --> 13:02.345
But because of your drinking,
we feel like we're losing you.

13:02.413 --> 13:05.282
Is this an intervention?

13:05.349 --> 13:06.783
We all agree
it's gone too far.

13:06.851 --> 13:11.271
Kenneth. Richard Esposito.
Your two psychics.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.523
Wait. You're seeing
another psychic?

13:13.591 --> 13:18.595
I mean, I knew that.
No! I am not doing this!

13:18.646 --> 13:21.615
I'm leaving!
Read your letters.

13:21.699 --> 13:23.667
Jenna, everyone
has written you letters

13:23.734 --> 13:25.101
that they'd like to share.

13:25.153 --> 13:28.572
"Miss Maroney, your addiction
has negatively affected me

13:28.639 --> 13:30.373
"in the following ways.

13:30.441 --> 13:32.792
"Number one,
I was so worried,

13:32.877 --> 13:35.412
I forgot to write
the rest of this letter."

13:35.463 --> 13:39.049
Thank you.

13:39.116 --> 13:44.838

[Cries]

13:46.924 --> 13:49.976

[Bleep], [Bleep].

13:52.013 --> 13:53.530
'Scuse me.
Is that my computer?

13:53.598 --> 13:57.934
No, I was just...
no, pinwheel. Not now.

13:57.985 --> 14:00.470
Are you on my email?
Are you emailing my husband?

14:00.538 --> 14:01.855
I can explain.

14:01.939 --> 14:04.691
I'm asleep right now and I think
that that's my computer.

14:04.775 --> 14:06.810
Gah. Huh? Whuh?
Where am I?

14:06.878 --> 14:09.746
"Tracy, as your wife,
I'm ordering you to come home."

14:09.813 --> 14:11.915
- I know this looks bad.
- "The kids need you.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.668
"And I want to give you
all the sex things you like."

14:14.752 --> 14:16.219
You don't have to read
any more.

14:16.287 --> 14:17.654
"For instance, doing it
across the bed

14:17.705 --> 14:18.855
"instead of up and down."

14:18.923 --> 14:20.457
- Saw that in a movie.
- "Come home now.

14:20.508 --> 14:22.842
"Sho 'nuff, Angie."
Sho 'nuff?

14:22.927 --> 14:24.628
It's a first draft.

14:24.679 --> 14:27.797
Are you trying to trick Tracy
into coming home?

14:27.848 --> 14:30.700
Were you trying to trick me
with my wedding video?

14:30.768 --> 14:34.037
Listen, you're not in charge.
I am.

14:34.105 --> 14:37.524
- Mind your own business.
- Yeah, well, Tracy is my... ow.

14:37.608 --> 14:39.276
There's more
where this came from.

14:39.343 --> 14:41.978
I'm contractually obligated
to pull out some bitch's weave

14:42.046 --> 14:44.397
eight more times
this season.

14:44.482 --> 14:48.652
It's not a weave. Gah.

15:02.005 --> 15:07.260
♪ It's the beauty
by of redemption ♪

15:07.327 --> 15:08.427
Jenna, will you accept
the help

15:08.495 --> 15:09.495
we're offering you today?

15:09.563 --> 15:10.763
Of course.

15:10.831 --> 15:14.967
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

15:17.904 --> 15:21.541
Jenna, this is Charles.
He has his van waiting outside.

15:21.608 --> 15:22.942
How nice.

15:23.010 --> 15:24.327
He's gonna take you
to the airport

15:24.411 --> 15:25.695
and then fly with you

15:25.779 --> 15:29.782
to the Alternatives Treatment
Center in Minnesota.

15:29.850 --> 15:34.003
Well, of course, 'cause that's
how interventions end.

15:34.087 --> 15:35.621
And I can't back out now

15:35.672 --> 15:37.489
otherwise they can't use
any of this.

15:37.541 --> 15:38.991
Oh, God.

15:39.042 --> 15:40.826
Anyway,
that's why I did it.

15:40.878 --> 15:42.345
One, To see the fear
in her eyes.

15:42.429 --> 15:44.430
And two,
Without Tracy or Jenna,

15:44.498 --> 15:46.265
we can file a claim
against the show's insurance

15:46.333 --> 15:48.734
and keep getting paid
without working.

15:48.802 --> 15:51.904
So this is kind of the best day
of my life.

15:53.974 --> 15:56.709
After my second husband
shot me the second time,

15:56.777 --> 15:59.879
I realized that love
is the most important thing

15:59.947 --> 16:01.881
in the world.

16:01.949 --> 16:05.985
I just hope Frank does
the right thing.

16:06.036 --> 16:08.354
[Gasps] Oh, Frank.

16:08.422 --> 16:10.356
How did you know
where I work?

16:10.424 --> 16:11.858
It's one of the benefits
of being in love

16:11.925 --> 16:14.493
with a registered
sex offender.

16:14.545 --> 16:17.897
Frank, about what happened
at Randi's Strippercise Studio...

16:17.965 --> 16:22.585
No. You were right.
I have been afraid to grow up.

16:22.669 --> 16:25.087
Well, what are you doing?

16:25.172 --> 16:27.539
I'm throwing out
my kid stuff.

16:27.591 --> 16:29.041
I want to become the man
you waited for.

16:29.092 --> 16:30.259
The man you helped cheat

16:30.344 --> 16:32.044
on the presidential physical
fitness test.

16:32.095 --> 16:33.846
Well, if you didn't get better
at the shuttle run,

16:33.914 --> 16:36.232
they were gonna put you
in the hospital.

16:36.316 --> 16:38.517
Oh, no. That's your favorite.
You can't.

16:38.569 --> 16:42.054
Skeletor's not my favorite.
You are.

16:43.774 --> 16:46.558
Are you throwing toys
in the fryer?

16:46.610 --> 16:48.094
You're fired, Onkman.

16:48.161 --> 16:50.229
Now give me a waiver to sign.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.666
The world has to be educated
about blurry face syndrome.

16:57.004 --> 16:59.738
Angie's changed her hairstyle
since this last photo was taken

16:59.790 --> 17:03.709
and D'Fwan
is a queer-fectionist.

17:03.777 --> 17:07.262
Wow.
She gets a whole window?

17:07.347 --> 17:10.082
Wait.
What used to be there?

17:23.480 --> 17:25.815
Oh, Angie,
a Queen of Jordan indeed.

17:25.898 --> 17:27.316
- Muah.
- Nnn.

17:27.401 --> 17:31.904
Jack, I also suffer
from Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

17:31.972 --> 17:35.741
It was the chair. Oh.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.743
I hope you're not this clumsy
on the dance floor.

17:37.794 --> 17:40.446
- I am not clumsy.
- You know why you're so tense?

17:40.514 --> 17:42.748
It's 'cause you have
a secret locked up inside you.

17:42.799 --> 17:44.917
A man-sex secret.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.836
You know what, I give up.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.588
If this idiotic show insists
on portraying me

17:49.640 --> 17:52.591
as some clumsy,
gay flatulent, so be it.

17:52.643 --> 17:55.344
I am extremely secure
in my athleticism,

17:55.429 --> 17:58.097
my masculinity,
and my rectal integrity.

17:58.148 --> 18:00.816
- Mm-hmm.
- "Mm-hmm," indeed, D'Fwan.

18:00.901 --> 18:02.435
I know who I am.

18:02.502 --> 18:06.022
So if you want to dance,
it would be my pleasure.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.852
Yeah, he's straight.
That boy cannot dance.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.456
I know what D'Fwan said
about me and it is on.

18:23.523 --> 18:25.124
I'm a superb dancer.

18:25.192 --> 18:27.827
At Princeton, I played Maria
in an all-male production

18:27.894 --> 18:30.296
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

18:30.364 --> 18:34.433
Oh, forget it. You people should
be ashamed of yourselves.

18:34.501 --> 18:36.218
Ah.

18:36.303 --> 18:37.970
Jenna,
what are you doing here?

18:38.021 --> 18:39.672
You're supposed
to be on a plane.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.007
I explained to Charles
that I was just pretending

18:42.059 --> 18:44.877
to be an alcoholic
to get on camera.

18:44.945 --> 18:46.178
And we laughed.

18:46.229 --> 18:48.647
And he said I can drink
as much as I want.

18:48.699 --> 18:51.384
So cheers to good friends.

18:51.451 --> 18:53.285
You... you're insane!

18:53.353 --> 18:55.788
In the lobby, she pulled
a wrench out of her purse,

18:55.856 --> 18:57.189
hit me over the head.

18:57.257 --> 18:59.291
I will never go
to Minnesota.

18:59.359 --> 19:00.543
"My Single is Dropping"

19:00.627 --> 19:03.062
is not just
about a single dropping.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.631
It's about a woman
learning to fly.

19:05.699 --> 19:09.218
A woman who doesn't need a man
or anybody

19:09.302 --> 19:12.254
except Josh at Sidney Bernstein
Management,

19:12.339 --> 19:14.039
Sidney at Josh Bernstein
Accounting.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.808
Shut up, Angie.
Just shut up!

19:15.876 --> 19:18.911
I'm sick of your selfishness.
People's jobs are at sake.

19:18.979 --> 19:22.264
I'm selfish?
You are a joke.

19:22.349 --> 19:23.866
And everybody thinks so.

19:23.934 --> 19:25.351
Let me talk.
I am talking.

19:25.402 --> 19:27.086
Will you let me talk?
Can I talk for once?

19:27.154 --> 19:28.954
You need to call Tracy
right now

19:29.022 --> 19:30.556
because I know
that he is your man,

19:30.607 --> 19:32.274
but he is my man too.

19:32.359 --> 19:34.443
And <i>TGS</i> is my family.

19:34.528 --> 19:38.730
And my family
is thick as thieves.

19:38.782 --> 19:41.733
Now who here wants
to teach me how to fight?

19:41.785 --> 19:45.004
[Cries]

19:45.071 --> 19:46.672
Attention everyone.

19:46.740 --> 19:49.041
I found a glove
in the elevator.

19:49.109 --> 19:53.846
If anyone is missing a glove,
I may have found your glove.

19:53.913 --> 19:56.348
Angie, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to make you cry.

19:56.416 --> 20:02.221
No. It's not you,
Liz Lemon. It's them.

20:02.272 --> 20:06.025
I miss my weird love,
but he won't come back.

20:06.093 --> 20:07.359
What?

20:07.427 --> 20:09.662
I've been trying
to get Tracy to come back

20:09.729 --> 20:12.481
ever since he left,
but he won't.

20:12.566 --> 20:15.968
So I sit and act
like this is what I want.

20:16.036 --> 20:19.155
But what I really want
is for everything to go back

20:19.239 --> 20:21.407
to the way it used to be.

20:21.475 --> 20:22.958
I just want to wake up
in the morning

20:23.043 --> 20:26.128
and look over
at my husband asleep...

20:26.213 --> 20:27.947
On our neighbor's roof.

20:28.014 --> 20:30.833
But if you can't get him
to come back, who can?

20:30.917 --> 20:32.001
What if he never comes back?

20:32.085 --> 20:34.786
What is going to happen
to all of us?

20:34.838 --> 20:38.624
Wait. You know what,
this is my glove.

20:38.675 --> 20:42.178
If anyone sees another glove,
I've lost one of my gloves.

20:42.262 --> 20:44.180
