00:07.332 --> 00:09.488
Estate is the Garden of Eden.

00:09.592 --> 00:12.059
But it's been a good home to us-- to me,

00:12.163 --> 00:16.334
Frank Gallagher, and me kids, who I'm proud of.

00:16.439 --> 00:20.888
Because every single one of them reminds me a little of me.

00:23.181 --> 00:24.258

FRANK (VOICEOVER): Fiona, who's a massive help.

00:29.438 --> 00:31.732
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why

00:31.836 --> 00:33.853
nobody calls a Philip anymore.

00:33.957 --> 00:37.605
Ian, a like his mom, which is handy for the others,

00:37.710 --> 00:39.204
because she's disappeared into thin air.

00:39.308 --> 00:42.436
And Carl, we daren't let him grow his hair for two reasons--

00:42.541 --> 00:45.843

- I know. - Green trilby.

Shagging a 16-year-old, what's that all about?

10:07.828 --> 10:09.600
It's legal.

10:09.705 --> 10:11.339
Where do you get off telling him what to wear

10:11.442 --> 10:12.868
and taking him to get his hair cut?

10:12.972 --> 10:15.336
You're not his mother.

10:15.439 --> 10:16.622
Neither are you, Fiona.

10:20.201 --> 10:21.940

I was just giving her a few tips.

10:29.343 --> 10:30.316
[kiss] [kiss]

10:30.419 --> 10:31.324
See ya.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.272
See you later, Fiona.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.905
See you later, Debs.

10:44.010 --> 10:44.948
DEBBIE: See you later.

10:45.052 --> 10:45.991
[sighs]

10:51.100 --> 10:52.420
He wanted me to give you something.

10:52.525 --> 10:54.576
Forget about it, Debbie. I don't want to know.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.549
But you--

11:00.798 --> 11:02.118
Hey.

11:02.223 --> 11:03.474
[baby cooing]

11:03.578 --> 11:05.629
About 11:00, they try and liquidize solids.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.236
Same again for lunch but a bit more lumpy.

11:08.339 --> 11:10.113
They should sleep till about half 6:00.

11:10.217 --> 11:12.719
But if you sing them a bit of Cliff Richard,

11:12.823 --> 11:15.014
slide off for another 10 minutes.

11:15.118 --> 11:16.195
Oh, yeah.

11:16.299 --> 11:17.968
VERONICA: We've got the spare room all sorted.

11:18.072 --> 11:20.748
Are you coming to auntie V and Uncle Kev's for the weekend?

11:20.852 --> 11:22.729
You're gonna love it.

11:22.833 --> 11:24.536
Yes, you are.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.310
SHEILA: I wouldn't ask, but I can't

11:26.413 --> 11:27.595
let the Lady Mayoress down.

11:27.699 --> 11:28.569
Aw.

11:31.349 --> 11:34.304
Big head, little legs.

11:34.407 --> 11:35.763
Which Cliff Richard, Sheila?

11:35.868 --> 11:40.003
Ooh, well, any, apart from "The Millennium Prayer."

11:40.108 --> 11:42.993
If all else fails, sing "Jerusalem,"

11:43.097 --> 11:46.781
and they go out like a pair of candles, don't you?

11:54.705 --> 11:56.200
How's there a God if his head ends up

11:56.304 --> 11:57.903
that far away from his boots?

12:05.619 --> 12:07.704
Come again.

12:07.809 --> 12:10.764
Don't actually register Brendan's death

12:10.868 --> 12:12.466
with the town hall.

12:12.571 --> 12:13.578
How can I not?

12:13.682 --> 12:14.760
It's in all the papers.

12:14.865 --> 12:17.959
Yeah, but only the next of kin has the authority

12:18.063 --> 12:21.121
to actually register the death.

12:21.226 --> 12:23.763
And I'm saying, don't.

12:23.867 --> 12:27.725
I turn up and sign for his benefits, 80 quid a week.

12:27.829 --> 12:29.949
We'll split it 60/40 in my favor.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.062
What have you got to lose?

12:31.166 --> 12:33.633
60%

12:33.738 --> 12:35.233
Yeah.

12:35.336 --> 12:39.437
But I mean, you know, Brendan, God bless him and all that.

12:39.542 --> 12:42.601
He's neither use nor fucking ornament to you now, is he?

12:42.705 --> 12:45.138
I will struggle without his money.

12:45.241 --> 12:46.911
Yeah.

12:47.015 --> 12:48.683
So what's Buddhism all about if it's

12:48.788 --> 12:54.001
not forcing the dead to behave like they're still here, eh?

12:54.106 --> 12:56.573
Well, you have to take Sadie off me hands.

12:56.677 --> 12:57.720
Sadie?

12:57.824 --> 12:58.763
[whistles] Sadie.

12:58.867 --> 13:01.369
[whistles]

13:01.474 --> 13:02.829
[whimpers]

13:02.934 --> 13:04.880
I hate the thing.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.660
Every time we had sex, it used to howl to be let out.

13:07.765 --> 13:09.293
Nearly wrecked our marriage.

13:09.398 --> 13:12.596
So anyway, nobody is more of a dog person than me, Lilian.

13:12.700 --> 13:13.569
Oh, right.

13:13.673 --> 13:14.577
I forgot.

13:14.681 --> 13:15.758
Ta-ra, Frank.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.218
Come on, Sadie.

13:17.323 --> 13:19.200
Who's a beauty?

13:19.304 --> 13:20.347
Who's a beauty?

13:23.509 --> 13:25.456
Meat.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.881
Sack.

13:26.986 --> 13:28.932
Meat.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.530
Sack.

13:30.634 --> 13:31.503
Come on.

13:31.608 --> 13:32.337
Come on.

13:32.441 --> 13:33.694
Come on, Scooby-fucking-doo.

13:33.798 --> 13:36.752
[yipping]

13:44.920 --> 13:46.102
[howls]

13:46.206 --> 13:47.040
[splash]

13:48.534 --> 13:53.644
(SINGING) Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

13:53.748 --> 13:56.319
[humming]

14:04.593 --> 14:06.851
What are you up to, you?

14:06.956 --> 14:08.658
What have you done to that bag?

14:08.764 --> 14:09.911
Caught in a fence.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.404
CAROL: Likely story.

14:11.508 --> 14:12.691
That's been burned.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.706
An electric fence.

14:14.811 --> 14:17.835
[sirens]

14:22.561 --> 14:24.717
[bell rings]

14:30.277 --> 14:33.059
You need to know what danger lies ahead for you.

14:33.162 --> 14:34.413
Are you threatening me, Bernie?

14:34.518 --> 14:36.882
If you split the vote, we'll have the lunatics

14:36.986 --> 14:38.064
running Chatsworth.

14:38.167 --> 14:39.557
You kip, I kip, we kip.

14:39.662 --> 14:41.330
Well, you should have thought about that

14:41.434 --> 14:45.153
before you refused us planning for extension out the back.

14:45.257 --> 14:47.412
Is that what all this has been about?

14:47.517 --> 14:48.421
Well, why didn't you say?

14:48.525 --> 14:49.846
A few phone calls, fix that.

14:49.950 --> 14:50.959
No problem.

14:51.063 --> 14:54.120
What Yvonne's saying Bernie, too late.

14:54.225 --> 14:55.267
You've crossed the line.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.797
We're sick of having to slip you backhanders

14:56.901 --> 14:58.153
for anything we need doing.

14:58.257 --> 15:00.655
People are sick of you charging for democracy.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.976
Now aren't you the noble one?

15:02.081 --> 15:03.366
Noble be buggered.

15:03.471 --> 15:05.486
If Kash gets on planning committee,

15:05.591 --> 15:08.059
he's never going to have to work another day in his life.

15:08.162 --> 15:10.352
Then, we might be able to afford an apartment in Spain.

15:10.456 --> 15:13.029
Hey, we can buy Bernie's when he's forced to sell up.

15:13.133 --> 15:14.071
[laughter]

15:14.176 --> 15:15.566
Be careful what you wish for.

15:18.277 --> 15:21.265
VERONICA AND KEV: (SINGING) Congratulations

15:21.370 --> 15:23.908
and jubilations.

15:24.012 --> 15:29.469
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be.

15:29.573 --> 15:34.230
Who would believe that I could be contented.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.795
What key are you in?

15:35.899 --> 15:40.765
BOTH: (SINGING) Was in the bad old days before I met you.

15:40.869 --> 15:45.804
When I let you walk into my heart.

15:45.909 --> 15:46.777
[crying]

15:46.883 --> 15:48.063
What's up, Debs?

16:03.496 --> 16:07.493
[sighs] You can't blame Fiona.

16:07.597 --> 16:09.544
Steve left her high and dry.

16:09.648 --> 16:11.629
Fine, if that's all he did.

16:11.734 --> 16:13.888
But he's come back to put things right.

16:13.993 --> 16:16.216
Bad timing, sweetheart.

16:16.321 --> 16:18.546
She's having Craig's baby.

16:18.650 --> 16:19.519
By accident.

16:19.623 --> 16:20.562
Yeah.

16:20.666 --> 16:25.011
[sighs] She's made some big decisions

16:25.114 --> 16:26.470
that she can't unpick.

16:26.574 --> 16:29.842
She likes Craig, but she loves Steve more

16:29.946 --> 16:32.622
than she'll ever love anybody.

16:32.726 --> 16:33.943
Listen, Debs.

16:34.046 --> 16:36.202
I'm one of the lucky ones.

16:36.306 --> 16:38.879
But we can't all have the perfect ending.

16:38.983 --> 16:39.921
KEV: Here we go.

16:40.025 --> 16:41.694
They were out of hot chocolate.

16:41.798 --> 16:45.552
So I got mushroom soup and a bit of grass to calm things down.

16:45.656 --> 16:46.421
Kev.

16:46.525 --> 16:48.854
Well, not for Debs, obviously.

16:53.268 --> 16:56.466
I need to make a phone call.

16:56.570 --> 16:59.350
Get Debs to show you how to download your music files.

16:59.454 --> 17:02.826
MAN: Which is inheritance tax in a nutshell.

17:02.931 --> 17:05.641
Which twisted shit came up with that little gem,

17:05.746 --> 17:07.414
inheritance tax?

17:07.518 --> 17:09.569
I've made sure my kids won't be saddled with that

17:09.673 --> 17:12.348
kind of torment one I'm gone.

17:12.453 --> 17:13.670
Kash in their policies.

17:13.773 --> 17:15.269
Let them watch you blow the lot while you

17:15.373 --> 17:16.798
have breath left in your body.

17:16.903 --> 17:17.666
Mm.

17:17.771 --> 17:18.919
Listen to the lady, eh?

17:19.022 --> 17:21.247
When there's a will, there's a way.

17:21.351 --> 17:23.367
Anyway, what are you gonna leave behind--

17:23.472 --> 17:24.375
a couple of skidmarks?

17:24.479 --> 17:26.078
[laughs]

17:27.224 --> 17:28.962
Go and answer a prayer, you fat cunt.

17:29.067 --> 17:31.048
Hey, he's just paid your drink off.

17:31.153 --> 17:32.021
Me?

17:32.126 --> 17:33.203
What for?

17:33.307 --> 17:34.420
Because he's bought us all a double?

17:34.524 --> 17:36.749
Must think we're simple.

17:36.854 --> 17:38.243
He's buying votes.

17:38.347 --> 17:40.050
That is not allowed.

17:40.155 --> 17:41.719
Rum and black, please, Jess.

17:41.823 --> 17:42.969
Bless you, Bernie.

17:43.074 --> 17:45.473
[dog yipping]

17:47.036 --> 17:48.497
FRANK: Oh, for fuck's sake.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.381
CAROL: Oh, hello, gorgeous.

17:51.486 --> 17:54.475
Is this the little minx you've taken off of Lilian's hands?

17:54.579 --> 17:59.271
One stroke of luck in 15 years, and that's me lot is it?

18:02.156 --> 18:03.268
[barks]

18:03.373 --> 18:05.389
YVONNE: You're covering Chatsworth East.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.439
Verna, you're in Selena's car.

18:07.543 --> 18:08.377
Now, come on.

18:08.481 --> 18:10.080
Let's go, go, go.

18:10.184 --> 18:11.262
Not you.

18:11.367 --> 18:12.340
Why not?

18:12.444 --> 18:15.642
Well, who's going to help me in shop?

18:15.746 --> 18:19.535
Verna, you've left your bloody bag.

18:19.639 --> 18:20.716
[thuds]

18:20.821 --> 18:21.690
[crashing]

18:21.794 --> 18:22.663
CAROL: Lilian, are you OK?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.504
What's this lot doing here again?

18:24.610 --> 18:27.494
Post-mortem found it, your Brendan.

18:27.598 --> 18:30.065
He had a bullet in his head.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.735
It killed him instantly.

18:31.839 --> 18:34.828
See, that's why he never dodged out of the way of the van.

18:34.931 --> 18:36.252
POLICEMAN: Ballistics are certain.

18:36.356 --> 18:38.199
That bullet came from the same gun that was used

18:38.303 --> 18:39.416
in a drugs killing last month.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.458
No.

18:40.563 --> 18:41.397
Drugs?

18:41.501 --> 18:42.822
Brendan?

18:42.926 --> 18:44.734
POLICEMAN: They found umpteen Class-A drugs in his system.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.923
His death could have bee part of a turf war gang job.

18:47.027 --> 18:48.731
POLICEMAN: We need you to come down to the station

18:48.835 --> 18:52.553
just to clear a few things up, if it's all right, Mrs. Tyler.

18:52.658 --> 18:54.187
Yeah? All right, lads.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.994
Put her in the van.

18:56.099 --> 18:57.870
Oh, Lilian.

18:57.976 --> 19:00.964
Brendan was no druggie.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.084
Look at him, for God's sakes.

19:03.189 --> 19:06.805
Post-mortem shows he was using marijuana, amphetamines, plus

19:06.908 --> 19:08.612
solvents from common adhesives.

19:08.716 --> 19:10.802
That face was totally self-inflicted.

19:10.905 --> 19:13.999
You're fitting him up to get out of paying any compensation,

19:14.103 --> 19:15.354
you devious buggers.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.987
Right, Stan.

19:17.091 --> 19:20.011
CCTV shots from the bookie's at the end of Easton Street.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.853
Five seconds before our van rams him,

19:21.958 --> 19:23.418
Brendan gets a bullet in the head.

19:23.522 --> 19:25.885
Five seconds later, skinhead with a white bike

19:25.989 --> 19:28.423
legs it from the scene-- a Chatsworth school uniform.

19:28.527 --> 19:30.959
See?

19:31.064 --> 19:33.289
Probably a drug runner.

19:33.393 --> 19:34.053
Right.

19:34.157 --> 19:35.304
Come on, Stan.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.285
Let's round up all the local skinheads,

19:37.390 --> 19:39.024
starting with the school.

19:39.128 --> 19:41.665
[sirens]

19:44.237 --> 19:47.192
[rustling]

19:51.293 --> 19:52.161
Here you go.

19:55.047 --> 19:56.541
You're the one with the gob.

19:56.645 --> 19:58.592
Why didn't you try getting elected?

19:58.696 --> 20:01.824
A, I'm the one that runs this business properly.

20:01.928 --> 20:03.771
I mean, and B, people generally hate my guts.

20:03.875 --> 20:05.230
Oh, give over.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.003
People respect you.

20:07.107 --> 20:09.053
Personally, I couldn't give a shit.

20:09.157 --> 20:11.834
But they're gonna love Kash making a name for himself.

20:11.938 --> 20:15.066
Because they think he's married to an hard-nosed bitch.

20:15.171 --> 20:17.082
Cherie Blair helped Tony get elected.

20:17.186 --> 20:19.585
Since when did Kash need elections to feel wanted?

20:19.690 --> 20:21.183
Since I told him to.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.782
Have you got a problem with that?

20:22.886 --> 20:25.980
Yeah, if Kash wins, I'm stuck here doing extra hours for you

20:26.084 --> 20:27.580
just so he can be somewhere else.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.630
Oh, and you think I started all this to keep you two apart?

20:29.735 --> 20:30.742
Well, haven't you?

20:48.155 --> 20:49.511
What are you doing in here?

20:49.615 --> 20:53.056
Looking for drugs, if you must know.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.940
Try asking.

20:56.045 --> 20:58.409
Proper drugs.

20:58.513 --> 20:59.381
Where's Fiona?

20:59.486 --> 21:00.355
She won't have any.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.467
She's skint.

21:01.571 --> 21:03.065
No?

21:03.170 --> 21:04.631
Well, what about your Carl?

21:07.655 --> 21:09.566
Here.

21:09.670 --> 21:12.972
Have a look at this.

21:13.076 --> 21:14.119
LIP: [murmurs] LENA: Pass it.

21:14.223 --> 21:15.126
Pass it. Pass it.

21:15.231 --> 21:16.100
Pass it.

21:16.204 --> 21:19.228
[laughter]

21:25.554 --> 21:26.492
Help.

21:26.596 --> 21:27.986
LIP: Where has he gone?

21:28.091 --> 21:29.551
Would you like a cup of coffee, Craig?

21:29.656 --> 21:31.010
No.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.436
Don't think I'll shoot straight up for the shower.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.617
Fiona up there?

21:33.721 --> 21:35.216
I don't know where she is.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.058
She went round to Veronica's to fix the washing machine.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.186
No, she hasn't.

21:40.291 --> 21:41.334
Does she know how?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.346
It's fine.

21:47.450 --> 21:48.770
It's working.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.787
I promised Steve I'd try and talk to you.

21:50.891 --> 21:52.977
Don't go taking it out on Debbie.

21:53.081 --> 21:54.749
I agree with her.

21:54.854 --> 21:56.627
What harm can 10 minutes do?

21:56.730 --> 21:58.259
You know fucking well what harm it will do.

21:58.365 --> 21:59.408
No, I don't, Fiona.

21:59.512 --> 22:01.283
Neither do you.

22:01.388 --> 22:05.559
If I agreed, if I showed up, what have I got to tell

22:05.664 --> 22:07.262
him that he'll want to hear?

22:07.367 --> 22:10.286
Probably wants to know whether you still love him or not.

22:10.390 --> 22:11.364
If I do--

22:11.468 --> 22:14.561
of course I do.

22:14.664 --> 22:17.238
What good's that going to do when he knows I'm pregnant?

22:17.342 --> 22:19.358
He's not going to want to hear that, is he?

22:19.462 --> 22:21.339
[crying]

22:23.876 --> 22:26.483
I don't know, sweetheart.

22:26.587 --> 22:28.429
You better ask him yourself.

22:31.453 --> 22:38.543
[gasps]

22:38.647 --> 22:40.037
Um, I was--

22:40.142 --> 22:44.730
um-- I really don't know what I'm supposed to say.

22:47.962 --> 22:49.562
DEBBIE: [muttering]

22:50.117 --> 22:51.334
Shh.

22:51.438 --> 22:55.122
Well, if Fiona's not late, I'm not late.

22:55.226 --> 22:57.937
Fuck off.

22:58.042 --> 23:01.518
Carl said your washer wanted seeing to.

23:01.621 --> 23:02.491
Here.

23:02.595 --> 23:03.430
That won't work.

23:03.534 --> 23:05.132
Let's see.

23:05.237 --> 23:06.731
Oh, Jesus.

23:06.835 --> 23:08.086
What's up, love?

23:08.191 --> 23:09.164
Soap powder in me eyes.

23:09.269 --> 23:10.693
Yeah, come on. Under the tap.

23:10.798 --> 23:11.840
Splash them.

23:11.945 --> 23:12.743
Have you got any towels, Veronica?

23:12.848 --> 23:13.579
Towels, yeah, upstairs.

23:13.682 --> 23:14.239
Stay there, Craig.

23:14.343 --> 23:16.220
Just-- stay there.

23:20.182 --> 23:22.128
[crying]

23:22.232 --> 23:23.171
STEVE: I'm not moving.

23:23.275 --> 23:24.388
I'm not moving.

23:24.492 --> 23:26.646
VERONICA: Listen, just get upstairs.

23:26.751 --> 23:27.586
Listen to me.

23:27.689 --> 23:28.628
Will you go upstairs?

23:28.732 --> 23:29.739
STEVE: Veronica, no, all right?

23:29.845 --> 23:31.339
For god's sakes, Steve.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.315
OK.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.566
Just blame me.

23:42.669 --> 23:43.712
And I'm not saying that.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.309
I asked him round here, not her.

23:59.423 --> 24:01.716
Can you come up here a sec, Carl?

24:01.821 --> 24:02.655
What for?

24:02.759 --> 24:05.643
Talk about Tuesday night.

24:05.748 --> 24:06.444
[door closes]

24:06.548 --> 24:08.112
Stupid gaz old prick!

24:08.216 --> 24:09.085
What have you done?

24:09.190 --> 24:10.093
What have you done?

24:10.197 --> 24:11.484
[screaming] Get off me.

24:11.587 --> 24:13.465
Get off.

24:13.568 --> 24:14.785
LIP: Lay off him, Debs.

24:14.889 --> 24:16.315
He's in bigger trouble. LENA: What is this?

24:16.419 --> 24:17.253
Lip, get off.

24:17.358 --> 24:18.226
I shot him--

24:18.331 --> 24:19.443
Brendan.

24:19.546 --> 24:23.440
It was me, all right?

24:23.543 --> 24:25.039
What did he say?

24:25.143 --> 24:27.923
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

24:28.027 --> 24:28.897
I swear.

24:49.646 --> 24:51.211
CRAIG: I need a straight answer, Fiona.

24:55.138 --> 24:56.424
Is that my baby?

24:56.528 --> 24:59.379
STEVE: Don't answer that.

24:59.483 --> 25:02.194
Ask him if that matters.

25:02.298 --> 25:03.514
What?

25:03.618 --> 25:04.800
Look.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.311
I came here for you, whatever that meant.

25:08.415 --> 25:11.612
And I've heard a hell of a lot that I didn't bank on,

25:11.716 --> 25:14.740
but I'm still here.

25:14.845 --> 25:16.027
So what does that mean?

25:16.131 --> 25:18.356
CRAIG: You-- you shut your fucking mouth

25:18.460 --> 25:20.128
before I do a lot of people a big favor

25:20.233 --> 25:21.275
and set your neck out.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.944
Back of a long queue, action man.

25:23.048 --> 25:24.091
Whoa. Whoa.

25:24.195 --> 25:25.654
Whoa. - Listen!

25:25.758 --> 25:28.748
Look, if all he wants to know is if it's his baby, then

25:28.852 --> 25:29.756
what's the question?

25:29.860 --> 25:31.182
I mean, what's his question?

25:31.286 --> 25:32.224
Fucker.

25:32.329 --> 25:33.267
[thuds]

25:35.421 --> 25:36.360
VERONICA: Craig?

25:36.463 --> 25:38.411
Craig?

25:38.514 --> 25:39.454
Craig.

25:39.557 --> 25:40.322
Craig.

25:40.427 --> 25:42.998
Craig, can you hear me?

25:43.102 --> 25:44.180
Look, let me in.

25:44.285 --> 25:45.501
You need to fuck off.

25:45.605 --> 25:46.822
The police are still looking for you.

25:46.926 --> 25:49.498
If they find you here, we're all dead.

25:49.602 --> 25:50.470
Watch.

25:50.575 --> 25:52.278
Watch yourself.

25:52.383 --> 25:53.251
FIONA: Oh my God.

25:53.357 --> 25:54.294
Oh my God.

25:54.399 --> 25:55.337
Oh my God.

25:58.569 --> 26:00.550
Hey, sweetheart.

26:00.655 --> 26:01.592
It's OK.

26:01.698 --> 26:02.531
Ah, yeah.

26:02.635 --> 26:05.139
Ambulance.

26:05.243 --> 26:07.224
Aye, yeah.

26:07.329 --> 26:10.353
6 Swansea Gardens, Chatsworth Estate, Stratford.

26:10.456 --> 26:11.568
Please, Fiona.

26:14.211 --> 26:15.808
I can't live without you.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.049
Why me?

26:20.153 --> 26:21.370
Because he needs someone with him.

26:21.474 --> 26:23.143
Well, I didn't see what happened, did I.

26:23.247 --> 26:24.706
He banged his fucking head.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.723
What more do they need to know?

26:26.827 --> 26:27.696
[sirens]

26:28.773 --> 26:29.607
[birds chirping]

26:29.711 --> 26:30.580
Yeah.

26:30.684 --> 26:31.831
Yeah.

26:31.937 --> 26:32.805
Ooh.

26:32.909 --> 26:33.812
Ooh. Ooh.

26:33.917 --> 26:34.786
Ooh.

26:34.891 --> 26:36.176
Go on!

26:36.281 --> 26:37.150
Come on.

26:37.255 --> 26:38.158
That's it.

26:41.356 --> 26:42.989
Yes. Yes.

26:43.093 --> 26:43.753
Come on.

26:43.857 --> 26:44.796
Come here.

26:44.900 --> 26:45.908
Come here. Ooh.

26:46.013 --> 26:47.125
Ooh. Yeah.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.098
Yeah.

26:48.202 --> 26:49.975
Ooh.

26:50.079 --> 26:51.018
[dog yelping]

26:51.122 --> 26:52.061
[crash]

26:52.165 --> 26:53.103
[tires squealing]

26:53.208 --> 26:54.702
[crash]

26:54.806 --> 26:57.552
Oh, I'm having flashbacks to Jack Brabham here, a nightmare.

26:57.656 --> 26:59.012
[tires squealing] [car horn]

26:59.116 --> 26:59.985
Debbie.

27:03.183 --> 27:04.087
What now?

27:08.535 --> 27:09.995
No. Hang on.

27:10.099 --> 27:11.385
Shut up.

27:11.489 --> 27:14.166
I don't want to know.

27:14.270 --> 27:15.139
What?

27:21.917 --> 27:26.504
Cannabis is on prescription for Brendan's glaucoma.

27:26.608 --> 27:28.589
And he only ever used the glue for bit of fun

27:28.694 --> 27:30.050
with the matches.

27:30.155 --> 27:32.935
So you're admitting he sniffed glue on match days?

27:33.039 --> 27:34.186
No, the matches.

27:42.006 --> 27:43.501
OK, fine.

27:43.605 --> 27:45.899
But that doesn't explain the amphetamine sulfate also found.

27:46.003 --> 27:47.255
They're mine.

27:47.358 --> 27:49.722
I was on them long before they were popular.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.294
I'd slip one in his dinner when he started to tell jokes.

27:52.398 --> 27:53.440
I'd do it before.

27:53.545 --> 27:54.936
So you were get speed on the NHS?

27:55.040 --> 27:58.168
Come off it. - Narcolepsy.

27:58.272 --> 28:02.338
If I get over excited, I have a habit of--

28:02.442 --> 28:04.319
[thuds]

28:06.232 --> 28:07.692
It is his baby.

28:10.402 --> 28:11.549
No, it isn't.

28:15.165 --> 28:16.102
It's yours.

28:21.143 --> 28:28.198
Look-- look, if we get married as soon as we get there,

28:28.302 --> 28:30.874
we're entitled to a two-bedroom flat.

28:30.978 --> 28:32.368
We can still turn over the odd car

28:32.473 --> 28:38.451
if we're careful, pay for bills and food and stuff.

28:38.555 --> 28:40.224
You'll have to get a part-time job, though,

28:40.328 --> 28:43.109
to pay for our drinking habits.

28:43.213 --> 28:44.812
I'm not drinking.

28:44.916 --> 28:46.376
Well, then, we're basically sorted out.

28:52.875 --> 28:58.680
Even if I could do this to Craig, I can't leave my family.

28:58.784 --> 29:01.843
STEVE: Fiona, we've been here before.

29:01.947 --> 29:07.300
They don't need you as much as you think they do.

29:07.404 --> 29:09.315
They don't.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.288
Just ask them.

29:14.563 --> 29:20.230
I promise you, Fiona, I will not let you down again.

29:23.565 --> 29:24.748
I'll make you happy.

29:37.851 --> 29:38.685
[sniffs]

30:04.788 --> 30:05.692
[kissing]

30:14.554 --> 30:16.187
I don't bake.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.065
I can't bake.

30:18.169 --> 30:21.923
You just have to make it look like you know how to.

30:22.027 --> 30:25.676
You, snap out of it or disappear.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.449
I don't want her to go.

30:27.553 --> 30:31.690
Neither would I if I was in as much bother as you.

30:31.794 --> 30:32.837
Tough shit, Carl.

30:32.941 --> 30:34.191
Fiona's going.

30:34.296 --> 30:35.861
Say one wrong word before she does, and I'll

30:35.965 --> 30:36.938
put your tongue out, got it?

30:40.274 --> 30:41.977
And that goes for all of you.

30:42.082 --> 30:45.975
If Fiona finds out about Carl, you're all dead.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.477
How are we gonna get Steve sorted?

30:48.581 --> 30:50.632
Hurry up.

30:50.737 --> 30:51.640
Kev's just phoned.

30:51.744 --> 30:52.961
Craig's signed hisself out.

30:53.065 --> 30:54.455
Seven stitches, and he signs hisself out.

30:54.559 --> 30:56.715
They're getting him in a taxi now.

30:56.819 --> 30:57.932
I should speak to him.

30:58.036 --> 30:59.216
Fiona, don't.

30:59.321 --> 31:00.990
You'll fall apart and change your mind.

31:01.094 --> 31:02.067
It's the least he deserves.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.041
No, it's not.

31:03.144 --> 31:04.360
He's second best.

31:04.465 --> 31:06.133
He's used to getting over stuff like this.

31:06.237 --> 31:08.637
LENA: Oh, I hope this is the last of them.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.486
We've got Steve on a backseat under a blanket.

31:11.591 --> 31:14.232
[chatter]

31:19.029 --> 31:20.767
Like he'll think it's for someone else.

31:20.871 --> 31:22.226
Come on.

31:22.330 --> 31:23.860
Will you hurry up?

31:40.473 --> 31:41.411
DEBBIE: Hurry, hurry.

31:41.516 --> 31:42.420
Move it!

31:50.623 --> 31:53.368
We're all gonna be fine.

31:53.473 --> 31:56.427
[kiss]

31:56.531 --> 31:57.991
CAROL: Look at me.

31:58.094 --> 31:58.895
State of me.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.084
Found me baking hands.

32:01.188 --> 32:03.622
I was hoping to send one with you.

32:03.726 --> 32:05.185
Take care of yourself.

32:05.289 --> 32:07.479
We'll need a number in case anything goes wrong.

32:11.093 --> 32:12.206
Come here.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.823
Hey, see you beautiful.

32:24.928 --> 32:26.492
LIAM: Where are you off to?

32:26.596 --> 32:27.673
Just Going on a holiday?

32:27.777 --> 32:28.681
OK.

32:28.786 --> 32:29.759
Could I have a cheeky kiss?

32:29.864 --> 32:30.733
STEVE: Fiona?

32:30.837 --> 32:31.705
And a cuddle?

32:31.810 --> 32:32.748
Fiona, we've got to hurry.

32:32.852 --> 32:33.721
Ooh.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.081
When are the cakes gonna be ready?

32:40.185 --> 32:41.785
No, but I can't leave him.

32:41.889 --> 32:44.392
No, you can.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.477
Dad and Sheila are gonna collect him.

32:46.581 --> 32:47.867
He's moving in with them.

33:02.186 --> 33:03.995
Is that true?

33:04.099 --> 33:04.968
Don't be soft.

LENA: You'd better.

33:39.481 --> 33:40.628
So where am I taking you?

33:40.733 --> 33:42.679
Car's parked in Gilton.

33:42.784 --> 33:43.722
[car honks]

33:43.826 --> 33:45.876
See ya.

See ya!

33:46.919 --> 33:47.858
[car honks]

34:10.693 --> 34:12.152
I got chucked off the bus for swearing.

34:12.257 --> 34:13.891
[flashback] Fuck you, twat!

34:13.994 --> 34:15.871
Fat bastard.

34:15.976 --> 34:18.304
I started walking home.

34:18.409 --> 34:21.155
That was when I found it.

34:21.259 --> 34:24.318
I didn't know what it was at first.

34:24.422 --> 34:26.195
It were just lying on the grass.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.025
It were dead heavy and cold.

34:31.130 --> 34:32.659
I knew it weren't a toy.

34:41.938 --> 34:44.476
DEBBIE: The fact you had a gun isn't the point, Carl.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.527
Why the fuck didn't you tell one of us

34:46.632 --> 34:48.091
or hand it in somewhere?

34:48.196 --> 34:51.949
I just wanted to know what it felt like.

34:52.054 --> 34:54.973
Took it to school, but no one knew.

34:58.901 --> 35:03.036
[laughs] I didn't know it was still

35:03.140 --> 35:08.424

Whoa!

35:29.208 --> 35:32.302
Watch it.

35:32.406 --> 35:34.666
I didn't know it was loaded.

Shit.

Christ.

36:05.391 --> 36:06.259
Oh.

36:10.396 --> 36:11.265
I'm sorry.

36:14.254 --> 36:16.026
Where's the gun now, Carl?

36:16.131 --> 36:17.973
[crying]

36:18.077 --> 36:18.911
Of course.

36:38.341 --> 36:39.869
Somebody take it off me, quick!

36:43.450 --> 36:47.412
What's going on?

36:47.517 --> 36:48.594
Where are we?

36:52.208 --> 36:53.981
Where's Steve?

36:54.085 --> 36:55.927
They've gone, Craig.

36:56.031 --> 36:57.144
Fiona's gone.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.775
Fiona!

37:03.886 --> 37:04.756
Craig!

Craig!

[gunshot]

37:11.185 --> 37:14.175
[car alarm ringing]

38:12.323 --> 38:13.574
So do you not think it looks like--

38:13.680 --> 38:15.868
No, it looks more like Carl Gallagher to me.

38:15.973 --> 38:17.050
POLICEMAN: That's what I think.

38:17.154 --> 38:18.163
POLICEMAN: Well, let's get over there

38:18.267 --> 38:19.275
and try and eliminate him.

38:19.379 --> 38:20.873
PRINCIPAL: Wish someone would.

38:20.978 --> 38:22.264
POLICEMAN: Is Carl in?

38:22.368 --> 38:24.384
DEBBIE: I'll handle this.

38:24.489 --> 38:26.052
How's things, Carl? DEBBIE: Fine.

38:26.156 --> 38:27.234
Why?

38:27.339 --> 38:28.660
Looks a bit tired.

38:28.763 --> 38:30.119
Been a bit busy, have we, son?

38:30.223 --> 38:32.204
Where were you about half 6:00 on Tuesday night?

38:32.308 --> 38:33.317
That's dead easy.

38:33.421 --> 38:34.568
He was at the hospital, weren't you, Carl?

38:34.672 --> 38:35.507
Oh?

38:35.611 --> 38:36.896
What for?

38:37.001 --> 38:39.920
Something he doesn't really want to discuss.

38:40.025 --> 38:41.485
(WHISPERS) Circumcision.

38:45.307 --> 38:46.906
Right. Right.

38:47.010 --> 38:47.775
Well, come on.

38:47.879 --> 38:48.957
Onwards and upwards, eh, Stan?

38:49.061 --> 38:49.930
Come on.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.508
You know, you're not on your own, Carl.

38:57.612 --> 39:03.520
And there's no shame in it whatsoever-- none, ever.

39:03.624 --> 39:05.084
And you won't look back.

39:05.189 --> 39:06.857
Well, not much.

39:10.368 --> 39:11.653
Are you right in the head?

39:11.757 --> 39:14.747
I mean, are you buying all this shit?

39:14.851 --> 39:16.450
VERONICA: How long before they suss that one?

39:16.555 --> 39:19.960
DEBBIE: Enough time to round up some skinheads.

39:20.065 --> 39:22.010
He was only in overnight.

39:22.116 --> 39:23.471
Tuesday night. - What for?

39:23.575 --> 39:25.348
LENA: I can't disclose what for, because boys

39:25.452 --> 39:28.718
are very sensitive about genital surgery.

39:28.823 --> 39:29.657
Fine.

39:29.761 --> 39:30.839
Thank you, sister.

39:30.944 --> 39:32.959
You're welcome.

39:33.064 --> 39:34.419
[sighs] I don't care.

39:34.523 --> 39:36.366
50 quid says that's Carl Gallagher.

39:36.470 --> 39:37.790
No one in their right mind is going

39:37.895 --> 39:39.286
to make something like that up.

39:39.390 --> 39:40.328
Right.

39:40.433 --> 39:43.074
[spits] 50 quid, put it there.

39:43.178 --> 39:47.210
VERONICA: Perry, Fizz, Pete, and Minty.

39:47.314 --> 39:49.642
Debbie's explained it's for charity.

39:53.257 --> 39:54.786
Will you shut up?

39:54.890 --> 39:56.872
DEBBIE: He looks like a leper

39:56.976 --> 39:57.880
VERONICA: Give us a minute.

39:57.984 --> 40:00.383

40:00.487 --> 40:02.016
What's this?

40:03.546 --> 40:04.379
A swoosh?

40:04.484 --> 40:06.014
Does Carl have a swoosh?

40:06.118 --> 40:06.952
No.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.238

40:08.342 --> 40:09.315
DEBBIE: Come on, Carol.

40:09.420 --> 40:10.601
Hurry up.

40:10.705 --> 40:11.817
Should get more than a tenner for this.

40:20.229 --> 40:21.862
Can the number two turn to the side, please?

40:26.068 --> 40:28.119
We're fucked.

Square one.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.402
- Sorry, Craig. - Cheers, mate.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.580
He's depressed.

40:38.684 --> 40:39.831
Fiona's dumped him.

40:39.935 --> 40:40.839
- No. - Yeah.

40:40.944 --> 40:41.778
Ah, he's all right.

40:41.882 --> 40:43.482
He's Craig.

40:43.585 --> 40:47.479
Full-time job, house is paid for, and not bad in bed.

40:47.582 --> 40:49.216
Take him in the bogs and suck him off.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.893
Could be a decent future there for you.

40:57.349 --> 40:58.532
Hey, gorgeous.

40:58.635 --> 40:59.505
Cheer up.

40:59.608 --> 41:00.999
It might never happen.

41:01.103 --> 41:04.996
If it helps, Fiona told me she didn't know for definite

41:05.100 --> 41:06.108
if the baby was yours.

41:09.757 --> 41:12.121
Sorry I'm late, Yvonne.

Who are you?

41:14.588 --> 41:16.083
This is Mick.

41:16.188 --> 41:17.716
He's going to be helping me out a couple of nights a week.

41:17.821 --> 41:20.046
So it's up to you which two nights you're dropping.

41:20.150 --> 41:25.954
I knew it, you hard-faced, two-faced, sour-faced bitch.

41:26.058 --> 41:31.307
And which two night you want to work at They Jockey.

41:31.412 --> 41:34.712
I've got you a job glass collecting since Kash is going

41:34.817 --> 41:36.972
to be spending more time in there socializing if he's

41:37.076 --> 41:38.050
going to stand a chance.

41:38.154 --> 41:39.648
Whoops.

41:39.753 --> 41:42.047
Mick's old enough to serve booze, so he can cop on his own

41:42.151 --> 41:42.846
for an hour.

41:42.950 --> 41:44.307
I'll be back at 10, Mick.

41:44.411 --> 41:46.218
No sweat.

41:53.447 --> 41:54.768

41:56.089 --> 41:58.799
Never mind questions in the house.

41:58.904 --> 42:00.641
We need answers in the house.

42:00.746 --> 42:01.823
Yeah.

42:01.927 --> 42:03.874
WOMAN: Ian, in your own time, love.

42:03.978 --> 42:08.045
People it took centuries, but the working man's vote

42:08.149 --> 42:12.876
is the most powerful weapon you'll ever possess,

42:12.980 --> 42:14.822
lest we forget.

42:14.927 --> 42:16.594
Got your toothbrush.

42:16.699 --> 42:18.541
Seven inches!

42:18.646 --> 42:19.688
Oh, hello.

42:19.793 --> 42:21.218
Where are you taking the prince of darkness?

42:21.322 --> 42:23.338
- Wales. - Flirty backsy coed!

42:23.442 --> 42:25.076
Wales? Fuck for?

42:25.180 --> 42:26.084
Moby dick!

42:26.188 --> 42:28.795
My sister's just had a baby.

42:28.899 --> 42:31.228
And that's still a big deal in Wales, is it?

42:31.333 --> 42:32.687
You look fantastic, Martin.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.877
Up the ass when you're ready.

42:50.101 --> 42:53.125
Have you got the tickets?

42:53.230 --> 42:54.897
Show me to the limo.

42:55.001 --> 42:57.573
[squeals] I couldn't get a limo,

42:57.678 --> 43:00.215
so I had to get a minibus.

43:00.319 --> 43:01.223
All right.

43:01.328 --> 43:02.682
Fair enough.

43:02.787 --> 43:05.742

43:08.174 --> 43:09.981
I can't see you. It's a bit dark.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.867
[laughter]

43:12.971 --> 43:14.500
That is a racist remark.

43:14.604 --> 43:19.609
Now, I'd be wondering, um, a shopkeeper's whose campaign--

43:19.713 --> 43:22.251
where is it--

43:22.356 --> 43:26.491
on value for money, when all he and his family's ever done was

43:26.596 --> 43:28.230
bring down the house prices.

43:28.334 --> 43:29.064
[cheering]

43:29.168 --> 43:31.010
This is way below the belt.

43:31.114 --> 43:32.574
But it's the truth.

43:32.678 --> 43:36.259
And gloves off, you better listen to the echos, Hiawatha.

44:04.168 --> 44:07.644
Everybody round here knows where my heart lies.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.138
My heart's in Chatsworth. - Yes.

44:09.243 --> 44:10.668
[cheering]

44:10.772 --> 44:14.004
And I prove it every single day by keeping a shop open

44:14.109 --> 44:15.567
for 12 fucking hours.

44:15.672 --> 44:16.541
Yes.

44:16.646 --> 44:17.653
[cheering]

44:17.757 --> 44:19.114
Yeah?

44:19.218 --> 44:21.337
But At what profit margins, ladies and gentlemen?

Name a single other shop that takes milk tokens for booze.

[cheering]

44:37.222 --> 44:38.473
Fine!

44:38.577 --> 44:42.922
But the only constituents my little brown friend here

44:43.026 --> 44:45.250
supports are the blacks, the chinks,

44:45.355 --> 44:49.316
the complete fucking leg irons, the works out jobless scum

44:49.420 --> 44:53.141
that bleed this fucking nation dry!

44:53.245 --> 44:54.184
Yeah, Bernie!

45:09.164 --> 45:11.840
One of you get the car now.

45:11.944 --> 45:12.813
Quick.

Feels weird without her here.

46:00.221 --> 46:02.446
CARL: I've got one thing I need say.

46:05.434 --> 46:08.562
The night before he died, I gobbed

46:08.667 --> 46:10.718
on Brendan from the upstairs of a bus

46:10.822 --> 46:12.004
and called him a rag-eyed gunk.

46:17.252 --> 46:18.087
Just that.

46:21.215 --> 46:23.161
The only thing bothering me is making sure everybody

46:23.264 --> 46:25.212
knows how much a week we need to stay in the black.

46:25.315 --> 46:26.462
We've always managed before, Debs.

46:26.567 --> 46:29.348
Yeah, With Fiona's wages, meaning,

46:29.452 --> 46:31.502
everyone needs to bring in an extra 15 a week.

46:31.606 --> 46:33.205
Not me. I'm not family.

46:33.309 --> 46:34.317
Neither is our Martin.

46:34.422 --> 46:35.639
It makes no difference.

46:35.743 --> 46:37.134
If you can't match the rent rise,

46:37.237 --> 46:38.871
we're going to have to advertise for tenants that will.

46:38.975 --> 46:40.365
She's right, Carol.

46:40.470 --> 46:42.381
You know you can't go blowing your spends on clothes

46:42.485 --> 46:43.250
all the time. [laughter]

46:43.354 --> 46:45.301
Right fair dues is that, Lip.

46:45.405 --> 46:47.421
And you earn about three times more from the shop

46:47.525 --> 46:48.812
than you're telling the rest of us.

46:48.916 --> 46:49.854
[laughs]

46:49.959 --> 46:52.530
[baby crying]

46:53.956 --> 46:54.964
What's that?

46:55.068 --> 47:00.073
[singing] Congratulations and celebrations

47:00.177 --> 47:04.278
when I tell everyone that you're in love with me.

47:04.382 --> 47:06.156
That's quite old.

47:06.259 --> 47:09.249
Shoot, this is old Cliff Richards.

47:09.353 --> 47:10.743
What?

47:10.847 --> 47:12.203
[knocking]

47:12.307 --> 47:14.288
DEBBIE: What are you doing?

47:14.392 --> 47:16.965
Trying to get Pinky and Perky to sleep.

47:17.069 --> 47:19.292
Fucking insomniacs, or what.

47:19.398 --> 47:21.032
Cliff doesn't work after dark.

47:21.136 --> 47:22.526
Try Jerusalem.

47:22.630 --> 47:26.071
EVERYONE: (SINGING) And did those feet

47:26.175 --> 47:37.471

47:49.567 --> 47:50.922
What are you doing here?

47:51.026 --> 47:52.105
I thought it was an all-nighter.

47:52.208 --> 47:53.876
Frank got a bit sick during pudding,

47:53.981 --> 47:57.560
so the Lady Mayoress had to get us a car home.

47:57.665 --> 47:58.882
Like a Rolls Royce?

47:58.986 --> 48:03.018
No, it was a police car.

48:03.121 --> 48:04.129
Hello.

48:04.234 --> 48:05.068
Hello.

48:05.173 --> 48:07.571

Wakey, wakey, wide awake.

48:10.177 --> 48:16.851

48:16.956 --> 48:22.760
walk upon England mountains green?

48:22.864 --> 48:34.646
And was the holy lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures?

48:34.751 --> 48:36.593
KEV: If I could shoot sperm that didn't swim backwards,

48:36.697 --> 48:39.164
I'd have me own family by now.

48:39.268 --> 48:42.362
In the mean time, I'm settling for this one.

48:42.467 --> 48:44.865
[barking]

48:44.969 --> 48:45.908
Oh, geez.

48:46.012 --> 48:47.368
EVERYONE: (SINGING) --fight.

48:47.472 --> 48:54.180

49:50.521 --> 49:57.680
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand

49:57.785 --> 50:05.988
till we have built Jerusalem in England's

50:06.091 --> 50:09.638
green and pleasant land.

50:09.742 --> 50:11.201
[phone ringing] DEBBIE: Will somebody get that?

50:11.305 --> 50:12.244
LIP: It's Ian's phone.

50:12.348 --> 50:13.286
IAN: Suck me cock.

Fiona, it's for you.

50:33.585 --> 50:34.419
Fiona?

50:39.180 --> 50:40.014
Oh, fuck you.

50:40.118 --> 50:41.127
She's not in.

50:41.231 --> 50:42.308
Try later.

50:42.413 --> 50:43.665
LIP: Pass us that chicken, will you, Sheila?

50:43.769 --> 50:44.602
