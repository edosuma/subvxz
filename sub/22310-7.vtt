WEBVTT

00:01.427 --> 00:03.218
-<i> Last year, a competition</i>

00:03.262 --> 00:05.929
<i>was created to test the
nation's best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.265
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:10.142
<i>craftsmen from all over
the country</i>

00:10.185 --> 00:12.394
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:12.438 --> 00:14.229
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:14.273 --> 00:15.897
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.941 --> 00:17.232
- I want to win!

00:17.276 --> 00:18.692
- It would be a life-changing
moment.

00:18.736 --> 00:20.152
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.195 --> 00:22.738
<i>Now the Forge returns
with challenges</i>

00:22.781 --> 00:24.990
<i>unlike anything ever
seen before.</i>

00:25.034 --> 00:26.742
- You'll be using this.

00:26.785 --> 00:30.412
<i>Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.456 --> 00:32.456
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:33.915
<i>Some will fall.</i>

00:33.959 --> 00:35.919
<i>But only the best
will be crowned</i>

00:35.961 --> 00:37.669
<i>"Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.713 --> 00:39.921
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.965 --> 00:42.924
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:42.968 --> 00:49.681
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:49.725 --> 00:51.099
- My name is Erin.

00:51.143 --> 00:54.269
I've been bladesmithing
for 20 years.

00:54.313 --> 00:55.771
<i>I'm self-taught.</i>

00:55.814 --> 00:58.774
I really... I just enjoy
the whole process

00:58.817 --> 01:01.193
of bladesmithing.

01:01.236 --> 01:02.986
<i>- My name is Kevin Klein.</i>

01:03.030 --> 01:05.072
I've been making blades
for about four years now.

01:05.115 --> 01:06.448
<i>It's a kind of freedom.</i>

01:06.492 --> 01:07.949
<i>I hate getting up in the morning</i>

01:07.993 --> 01:09.493
<i>and going and working
for someone else.</i>

01:09.536 --> 01:11.036
<i>- I'm Burt Foster.</i>

01:11.080 --> 01:12.996
<i>I've been a knifemaker
for 14 years.</i>

01:13.040 --> 01:14.998
Probably make between
200 and 400 knives a year.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.626
I still am fascinated
by the process

01:17.669 --> 01:19.795
<i>of completely transforming
a raw material</i>

01:19.838 --> 01:21.505
<i>into something different.</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:23.673
- My name's Chad Osborne.
I'm a farrier.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.967
<i>I shoe horses for six months
out of the year.</i>

01:26.011 --> 01:28.136
The other six months,
I forge blades.

01:30.349 --> 01:33.350
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.976
You are here to engage
in three rounds

01:35.020 --> 01:37.145
of competition
specifically designed

01:37.189 --> 01:39.648
to test every aspect
of your edged

01:39.691 --> 01:41.817
weapon-making capabilities.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.152
After each round,
you will hand your work over

01:44.196 --> 01:46.446
to our panel of expert judges:

01:46.490 --> 01:48.657
American Bladesmith Society
Master Smith,

01:48.700 --> 01:50.200
J. Neilson;

01:50.244 --> 01:53.495
historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker;

01:53.539 --> 01:55.789
internationally known
edged and impact

01:55.833 --> 01:59.209
weapon specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.837
Ultimately, they will decide
which of you

02:01.880 --> 02:03.505
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

02:03.549 --> 02:07.175
and walks out of here
with a check for 10 grand.

02:07.219 --> 02:09.219
In this first round,
you will be making

02:09.263 --> 02:12.055
a blade of your own choosing
using the carbon steel

02:12.099 --> 02:15.767
on your anvil as well as...

02:15.811 --> 02:16.893
wrought iron.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.770
<i>- Oh, [bleep].</i>

02:18.814 --> 02:20.689
<i>I've never worked with that
material ever before.</i>

02:20.732 --> 02:22.190
Wrought iron's hard
to make a blade

02:22.234 --> 02:24.234
because the carbon content's
so low,

02:24.278 --> 02:26.194
you can never get
a hard enough blade.

02:26.238 --> 02:28.864
<i>You cut a couple things,
and your edge is gonna roll.</i>

02:28.907 --> 02:30.740
- You will have to combine
the wrought iron,

02:30.784 --> 02:32.659
which, because of its
low carbon content,

02:32.703 --> 02:35.537
cannot be hardened,
with that carbon steel

02:35.581 --> 02:38.874
to create
a fully functioning blade.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.542
The blades themselves
must fall within

02:40.586 --> 02:43.044
the following size parameters.

02:43.088 --> 02:45.213
The length of the blade,
not including the tang,

02:45.257 --> 02:48.717
<i>must be between
12 and 16 inches.</i>

02:48.760 --> 02:53.430
<i>The overall length of blade
must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

02:53.474 --> 02:56.433
In round two, your blades
will be tested

02:56.477 --> 02:58.185
<i>against paint cans</i>

02:58.228 --> 03:00.896
<i>and rolled tatami mats.</i>

03:00.939 --> 03:04.399
You will have 15 minutes
to work on your design.

03:04.443 --> 03:07.486
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:07.529 --> 03:09.070
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:09.114 --> 03:11.740
Your time starts...
now.

03:11.783 --> 03:14.367
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:14.411 --> 03:17.579
- My signature blade
is a hunter-style knife.

03:17.623 --> 03:20.457
<i>I definitely take the hunter
knife to a new level,</i>

03:20.501 --> 03:23.752
<i>making it utilitarian,
but sculptural.</i>

03:23.795 --> 03:24.795
It's an art piece.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.589
It's not just a knife.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.550
<i>- What I'm gonna make
is a pirate-style camp knife.</i>

03:30.594 --> 03:33.136
<i>It's gonna have a built-in
integral handguard.</i>

03:33.180 --> 03:35.138
I've never made this
type of handle before,

03:35.182 --> 03:36.806
<i>but I think it's gonna pay off,</i>

03:36.850 --> 03:38.308
'cause I'm hoping the judges
have never

03:38.352 --> 03:40.936
seen something like this.

03:40.979 --> 03:44.439
- I am making what I would
call a camp knife.

03:44.483 --> 03:46.149
<i>I love working with
pattern-welded steel.</i>

03:46.193 --> 03:47.692
<i>I love the process of making it.</i>

03:47.736 --> 03:49.945
There's a lot of opportunity
for the ability

03:49.988 --> 03:52.447
to make a beautiful object.

03:52.491 --> 03:54.324
<i>- I want to make a recurved
camp knife,</i>

03:54.368 --> 03:56.159
because it's gonna be long,
and it's gonna be fast,

03:56.203 --> 03:57.661
and it's gonna cut great.

03:57.704 --> 04:01.122
<i>My style is clean,
visually flawless,</i>

04:01.166 --> 04:03.959
but still high-performance
in a way that a person wants

04:04.002 --> 04:06.628
to use it, they can do anything
they want with that knife.

04:06.672 --> 04:10.298
- Bladesmiths, your design
window is now closed.

04:10.342 --> 04:13.927
Your three-hour forge time
starts...

04:13.971 --> 04:15.303
now.

04:15.347 --> 04:17.307
- Let's walk it over.
- All right.

04:17.349 --> 04:19.307
<i>First thing I'm thinking is,
what piece am I gonna use?</i>

04:19.351 --> 04:21.151
Some of it might be hollow,
and so I'm looking

04:21.186 --> 04:22.727
for a solid piece.

04:22.771 --> 04:25.146
<i>And some of the guys
have the same idea.</i>

04:25.190 --> 04:27.399
How many pieces did you want?
- Go boom, boom.

04:27.442 --> 04:28.984
- Taking turns cutting it.

04:29.027 --> 04:30.652
- It's amazing to see
these three guys

04:30.696 --> 04:33.446
working together to all
get the same material.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.574
- You cut this.

04:35.617 --> 04:36.992
- Like the smell
of burning paint?

04:37.035 --> 04:40.161
- Yeah.
- It's definitely a first.

04:40.205 --> 04:42.080
- Fire.
- Watch your eyes!

04:42.124 --> 04:44.332
<i>- I see that everybody's
cutting their wrought iron,</i>

04:44.376 --> 04:45.917
and I figured while
they're cutting,

04:45.961 --> 04:48.461
I'm gonna go ahead and start
a flat billet

04:48.505 --> 04:52.674
for all my iron to sit on
top of.

04:52.718 --> 04:55.176
- Not only do they got to
forge out the carbon steel,

04:55.220 --> 04:57.721
they got to forge out
the no-carbon as well.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.389
That's the interesting part
of this challenge.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.850
- I pick one of the thicker
pieces of wrought iron.

05:01.893 --> 05:04.644
<i>I know the guys wanted to
all get the steel</i>

05:04.688 --> 05:07.022
<i>and do it together,
but whatever I do,</i>

05:07.065 --> 05:08.732
it's always different.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.567
- That's all I wanted.
- All right. Is this mine?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.027
<i>- I'm gonna have to make
a three-layer billet.</i>

05:12.070 --> 05:13.070
Hot steel!

05:13.113 --> 05:14.237
A san mai billet.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.865
<i>It's like a bologna sandwich.</i>

05:16.908 --> 05:18.074
The bologna's
the high-carbon steel.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.743
The bread is soft steel.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.786
<i>And that's what san mai is.</i>

05:21.830 --> 05:24.497
- Burt is having no problems
moving metal right now.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.875
- No.

05:26.918 --> 05:28.376
- Inside my own head,
I have an artist,

05:28.420 --> 05:29.919
and I have a worker.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.380
If you have that little
psychotic dynamic

05:32.424 --> 05:34.174
<i>in your head, it sort of works.</i>

05:34.217 --> 05:35.383
Boom.

05:35.427 --> 05:36.676
I am a little bit psychotic.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.763
<i>My wife would say so.</i>

05:39.806 --> 05:43.058
Rather than just tack-welding
these three pieces together,

05:43.101 --> 05:46.603
<i>I know it's worth the extra
time to weld all the way around</i>

05:46.647 --> 05:49.856
both seams so that oxygen's not
gonna contaminate that weld.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.274
- 30 minutes has elapsed.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.443
You have two and a half hours
remaining.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.737
<i>- The clock is ticking,
and you want so badly</i>

05:55.781 --> 05:57.238
<i>just to get it out of there
and get working</i>

05:57.282 --> 05:59.032
<i>and do something, but you can't,</i>

05:59.076 --> 06:00.992
'cause it's got to be hot.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.329
[chuckles]

06:04.373 --> 06:07.123
- As far as I know,
Kevin hasn't set a weld

06:07.167 --> 06:08.416
at this point.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.086
- I am focusing more
on the pattern

06:11.129 --> 06:12.629
that I'm trying to put
into the seal.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.963
- He's still preparing.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.925
- Apparently he's got 13
layers of steel

06:16.968 --> 06:18.843
to set his san mai.

06:18.887 --> 06:20.512
- What?

06:20.555 --> 06:22.847
- I'm assuming he's not
a superstitious guy.

06:22.891 --> 06:25.392
- I want to see how many
layers I can get in the metal,

06:25.435 --> 06:28.436
so I decided to take
my high-carbon steel

06:28.480 --> 06:31.523
that I was using for my core,
cut it in half,

06:31.566 --> 06:34.776
take my laminated layers,
cut them into four pieces.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.779
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:37.823 --> 06:40.782
- He's got a stack of
six more pieces of metal.

06:40.826 --> 06:43.326
- Now I've got a billet
that's 49 layers.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.453
I don't think anyone else
here is gonna do that,

06:45.497 --> 06:49.124
so maybe it'll help me
stand out a little bit.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.084
- I'm more worried
than impressed right now.

06:51.128 --> 06:52.752
- Maybe I should be more worried
than I am,

06:52.796 --> 06:56.131
but, you know, you can only
move metal so quickly.

06:56.174 --> 06:57.966
<i>- I get all the billets
together.</i>

06:58.009 --> 06:59.676
Oh, yeah.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.636
<i>I flux it, get it to forge,</i>

07:01.680 --> 07:04.264
<i>set the weld
on the power hammer.</i>

07:04.307 --> 07:07.058
For not ever trying
to do Damascus before...

07:07.102 --> 07:08.351
Doing a san mai!

07:08.395 --> 07:10.353
Just like the recipe.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.647
Soft, soft, hard.

07:12.691 --> 07:13.982
It worked perfect.

07:14.025 --> 07:16.568
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:16.611 --> 07:18.153
I'm drawing out the handle.

07:18.196 --> 07:21.156
Man, it's giving me
a little trouble.

07:21.199 --> 07:23.032
It's sucking up all my time.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.617
<i>But I hope the judges like it.</i>

07:24.661 --> 07:26.161
- Oh, look, look.

07:26.204 --> 07:27.996
He's gonna split it
and forge weld it on.

07:28.039 --> 07:29.664
- We don't see a lot of
integral guards,

07:29.708 --> 07:30.999
which is really neat.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.667
- Ooh.
Oh, God.

07:32.711 --> 07:34.586
It's starting to break
in certain spots.

07:34.629 --> 07:36.087
<i>If I don't get this handle
done right,</i>

07:36.131 --> 07:38.381
<i>I could be going home.</i>

07:38.425 --> 07:39.591
[groans]

07:39.634 --> 07:41.509
¶ ¶

07:41.553 --> 07:43.511
- Here comes Burt.
- Well, that's hot.

07:43.555 --> 07:45.013
- That's that excess flux
coming off.

07:45.056 --> 07:46.681
That's a good sign.

07:46.725 --> 07:48.850
- After I draw the bar out
to nearly its finished length,

07:48.894 --> 07:50.518
cut about a half an inch
off the end,

07:50.562 --> 07:52.187
because I want to put it
on my anvil

07:52.230 --> 07:53.563
<i>and just forge on it
with my hammer</i>

07:53.607 --> 07:58.568
<i>to try to split
those layers apart.</i>

07:58.612 --> 07:59.861
When I can't do that,
I know I've got

07:59.905 --> 08:01.279
a good, solid weld.

08:01.323 --> 08:03.198
I'm pretty excited because
I realize

08:03.241 --> 08:05.992
the one thing that can
really go wrong here

08:06.036 --> 08:08.870
hasn't gone wrong,
and I'm still doing good.

08:08.914 --> 08:10.330
Groovy!

08:10.373 --> 08:11.664
- Bladesmiths!

08:11.708 --> 08:15.543
You have 90 minutes remaining.

08:15.587 --> 08:16.920
- [sighs]

08:16.963 --> 08:19.881
When I started welding,
I had my layers set up

08:19.925 --> 08:21.633
and was feeling really good
about it,

08:21.676 --> 08:24.719
<i>and then my first weld,</i>

08:24.763 --> 08:27.597
it just blew apart.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.265
- It opened up, didn't it?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.391
Wow.

08:30.435 --> 08:36.397
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:36.441 --> 08:38.191
- I can't get this [bleep]
to weld, man.

08:38.235 --> 08:39.567
- Well, you need to
hit it harder.

08:39.611 --> 08:42.904
- Put more flux on it,
and more weld,

08:42.948 --> 08:44.864
and more flux.

08:44.908 --> 08:47.367
All right, God.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.118
- He can flux it till
the cows come home.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.912
If it's a problem,
you got to fix it.

08:50.956 --> 08:52.622
- Well, I [bleep] this one.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.958
- It's not welded yet?
- Nope.

08:55.001 --> 08:58.419
I don't see being able
to finish a knife

08:58.463 --> 09:00.004
<i>from what I have.</i>

09:05.303 --> 09:08.137
<i>¶ ¶</i>

09:08.181 --> 09:09.430
- Bladesmiths!

09:09.474 --> 09:12.308
You have one hour remaining.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.018
- Oh, damn.

09:14.062 --> 09:16.980
The steel is just not
sticking together.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.606
- I'm feeling for the guy,
I really am.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.484
He's still in the game,
so he needs to let go

09:21.528 --> 09:22.986
and finish this challenge.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.780
<i>- I feel like
I can't make my blade.</i>

09:25.824 --> 09:29.617
It's just not here.

09:29.661 --> 09:31.244
- What's going on, brother?

09:31.288 --> 09:33.037
- There's not really much
I can turn in.

09:33.081 --> 09:35.123
That Damascus didn't...
- Keep working, bro.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.332
You never know what's
going on with

09:36.376 --> 09:37.792
somebody else's blade.

09:37.836 --> 09:40.253
You never know.
- Well...

09:40.297 --> 09:42.881
I'm kind of looking at him
like he's crazy.

09:42.924 --> 09:44.966
But I'm certainly not a quitter,

09:45.010 --> 09:47.719
so I'm gonna finish this.

09:47.762 --> 09:50.972
- All right, Erin's back
in front of his forge.

09:51.016 --> 09:53.016
I love it when people
don't give up.

09:57.355 --> 09:59.314
<i>- I will get something
to present.</i>

09:59.357 --> 10:00.648
I've got this.

10:00.692 --> 10:03.651
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:03.695 --> 10:05.153
- It's not looking
like a knife yet,

10:05.196 --> 10:06.779
so we'll see how it goes.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.907
- Honestly, I don't know
that there's any way

10:08.950 --> 10:11.993
he could know what the center
of that blade is going to be.

10:12.037 --> 10:13.536
<i>- For getting to the point
where I have</i>

10:13.580 --> 10:16.706
a hardened blade,
it won't be as pretty,

10:16.750 --> 10:18.166
<i>but it'll be functional.</i>

10:18.209 --> 10:20.168
I think.

10:20.211 --> 10:22.211
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:22.255 --> 10:23.838
<i>- Once I have the shape
of the knife I want,</i>

10:23.882 --> 10:25.214
it's so hot, I can't hold it.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.674
But I can't wait for it
to cool down.

10:26.718 --> 10:28.134
<i>So I just grab it with
a couple of pairs</i>

10:28.178 --> 10:30.845
<i>of vice grips
and start grinding it.</i>

10:30.889 --> 10:32.180
<i>I'm making a full tang knife.</i>

10:32.223 --> 10:33.848
I need to put holes in the tang,

10:33.892 --> 10:36.517
because if the tang hardens,
I'll never be able

10:36.561 --> 10:38.645
<i>to get that drill bit
through the hole.</i>

10:38.688 --> 10:40.647
- 15 minutes, bladesmiths.

10:40.690 --> 10:42.023
- Here we go.

10:42.067 --> 10:46.402
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:46.446 --> 10:48.029
- Erin's in the oil.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.822
- He had me really concerned
that he wasn't

10:49.866 --> 10:52.742
even gonna get to this point,
and he's come back.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.118
- Burt's in.

10:54.162 --> 10:57.372
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:57.415 --> 10:58.873
Kevin's in the oil.

10:58.917 --> 10:59.874
- I quench my blade.

10:59.918 --> 11:03.544
<i>Things look good to me.</i>

11:03.588 --> 11:05.505
- I think Chad's going
for the dramatic finish.

11:05.548 --> 11:06.798
- Come on, Chad.

11:06.841 --> 11:08.299
- Quench, quench, quench,
quench.

11:08.343 --> 11:09.676
- Here we go.

11:09.719 --> 11:11.052
- Oh, my God.

11:11.096 --> 11:13.054
No, don't stir the oil!
- Ay-yi-yi!

11:13.098 --> 11:15.431
- One minute, bladesmiths!
- Come on!

11:15.475 --> 11:18.393
- You have one minute remaining!

11:18.436 --> 11:20.269
- There he goes.
- He's in.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.771
- Oh, thank goodness.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.731
<i>- I stick my blade in the oil.
I quench it.</i>

11:23.775 --> 11:25.066
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

11:25.110 --> 11:27.068
Then I pull my blade
out of the oil.

11:27.112 --> 11:29.237
Ooh.
Whammy.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.239
- It's got a pretty
severe bend in there.

11:31.282 --> 11:33.074
- If some of our smiths
would quench earlier,

11:33.118 --> 11:34.617
they could deal with these
little wiggles.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.286
- Ten, nine, eight,

11:37.330 --> 11:38.997
seven, six,

11:39.040 --> 11:41.833
five, four, three,

11:41.876 --> 11:45.169
two, one.

11:45.213 --> 11:46.671
Bladesmiths, stop working.

11:46.715 --> 11:49.966
Your forging window
is now closed.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.427
- That was intense.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.137
<i>- I'm happy.
The knife is done.</i>

11:54.180 --> 11:55.680
And it's kind of straight.

11:55.724 --> 11:57.265
<i>I hope I got it there.</i>

11:57.308 --> 12:03.146
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:03.189 --> 12:05.440
- Bladesmiths, in this first
round of competition,

12:05.483 --> 12:07.358
we asked you to take
high-carbon steel

12:07.402 --> 12:09.777
and wrought iron,
which cannot be hardened,

12:09.821 --> 12:11.612
and combine them
into a signature blade

12:11.656 --> 12:13.406
of your own design.

12:13.450 --> 12:16.451
Chad, it's time to present
your blade to the judges.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.077
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:18.121 --> 12:19.495
<i>- Overall, cool concept.</i>

12:19.539 --> 12:21.289
<i>I like the look of it.</i>

12:21.332 --> 12:24.459
You did that last-minute quench,
and you got a heck of a warp.

12:24.502 --> 12:27.003
- Very ambitious
to put the integral guard

12:27.047 --> 12:28.629
in the first round challenge.

12:28.673 --> 12:30.353
It's the first of its kind
that we've seen.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.593
It's got that en garde
with a V guard.

12:33.636 --> 12:35.136
Want to fight with it.
Very nice.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.679
- Thank you.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.973
- Burt, please present
your blade to the judges.

12:40.685 --> 12:42.351
<i>- I love the design.</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:45.188
<i>It looked like you had a plan
from beginning to end.</i>

12:45.231 --> 12:46.981
- Glad it looked like that
from your side.

12:47.025 --> 12:48.649
- [laughs]

12:48.693 --> 12:52.570
- Watching you work was like
a master craftsman

12:52.614 --> 12:54.989
doing a great,
beautiful painting.

12:55.033 --> 12:58.659
- Kevin, please present
your blade to the judges.

12:58.703 --> 13:00.828
<i>- Well, Kevin,
you did a cut and stack,</i>

13:00.872 --> 13:04.540
<i>giving us multiple layers
in a pattern weld.</i>

13:04.584 --> 13:06.375
A couple issues here to work on,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.169
but bold plan.

13:08.213 --> 13:09.587
- Thank you.

13:09.631 --> 13:11.547
- With that pattern
moving through there,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.841
how much hardened steel
do we have on that edge?

13:13.885 --> 13:16.010
Because we all know a knife
that won't hold its edge

13:16.054 --> 13:18.679
is a paperweight.

13:18.723 --> 13:19.764
- Erin.

13:19.808 --> 13:23.226
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:23.269 --> 13:26.646
<i>- When you started having
your delamination problems,</i>

13:26.689 --> 13:30.525
<i>I was really hoping that you'd
just peel those layers back</i>

13:30.568 --> 13:32.110
and reset them,

13:32.153 --> 13:34.195
but you gave us
a finished blade.

13:34.239 --> 13:35.905
Congratulations on that.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.657
- Yeah, we've all been there.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.201
Actually, I'm kind of seeing
a really neat pattern

13:40.245 --> 13:41.202
in that blade.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.703
- Probably abstract.

13:42.747 --> 13:44.372
- Yeah, you know.

13:44.415 --> 13:47.041
Actually, it feels good
in the hand.

13:47.085 --> 13:49.710
- Well, bladesmiths,
the judges need some time

13:49.754 --> 13:51.212
to make a decision.

13:51.256 --> 13:53.381
Thank you.

13:53.424 --> 13:56.926
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:56.970 --> 13:58.553
[laughter]

13:58.596 --> 14:01.180
- That was exciting.
- Yeah.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.558
- Let's go ahead and start
with Chad's blade.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.893
- Chad's blade, design-wise,

14:05.937 --> 14:09.230
there's a lot more comfort in
stabbing through and chopping.

14:09.274 --> 14:11.691
- He looks like he wants to
cut something with it already.

14:11.734 --> 14:13.568
- But, then again,
because of heat treating

14:13.611 --> 14:15.820
last minute there,
you've got that potato chip

14:15.864 --> 14:19.073
going over there, curve,
a lot of meat to work on.

14:19.117 --> 14:20.616
- Chad could heat up
the back spine,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.535
straighten that out.

14:22.579 --> 14:24.912
He's just got to work careful
if he goes to the second round.

14:24.956 --> 14:26.747
- Let's go ahead and move on
to Burt's blade.

14:26.791 --> 14:29.083
- The execution was closest
we've ever seen

14:29.127 --> 14:30.960
to flawless in a first round.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.504
- I love the spine.
I love the design of the thing.

14:33.548 --> 14:36.424
This is gonna be
a beautiful blade.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.926
<i>- Let's move on
to Kevin's blade.</i>

14:38.970 --> 14:40.887
- The pattern, really ambitious.

14:40.930 --> 14:41.888
It's a big risk.

14:41.931 --> 14:43.264
We have no idea

14:43.308 --> 14:45.433
how that pattern lines up
with that edge.

14:45.476 --> 14:48.603
Kevin might have wrought iron
and not have a hardened edge.

14:48.646 --> 14:49.937
- There's wrought iron
on that edge.

14:49.981 --> 14:51.939
There's no doubt.

14:51.983 --> 14:53.733
<i>- Last blade is Erin's blade.</i>

14:53.776 --> 14:55.443
<i>J?</i>

14:55.486 --> 14:58.279
- Again, we got the same issue
where we don't know

14:58.323 --> 15:00.031
if there's hard steel
on the edge.

15:00.074 --> 15:01.782
- You know what I noticed?

15:01.826 --> 15:04.243
You picked a piece of metal
out of a different railing.

15:04.287 --> 15:06.120
I wonder what that had
to do with it.

15:06.164 --> 15:07.371
<i>- What about length?</i>

15:09.167 --> 15:12.627
- From tip to shoulder,
we're only at 11 1/2.

15:12.670 --> 15:13.961
- Okay, judges,

15:14.005 --> 15:16.380
have you made a decision?

15:16.424 --> 15:18.966
- Yep.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

15:19.010 --> 15:25.014
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:25.058 --> 15:26.641
Bladesmiths,

15:26.684 --> 15:28.851
the judges have examined
your work,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.645
and they have made a decision.

15:30.688 --> 15:34.565
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:34.609 --> 15:36.317
Erin,

15:36.361 --> 15:38.569
you did not make the cut.

15:38.613 --> 15:41.030
- Erin, today wasn't your day.
- It was not my day.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.325
- You did charge forward,
gave us a hardened blade,

15:44.369 --> 15:46.535
but we have delamination
on the blade,

15:46.579 --> 15:48.829
and you didn't meet the length
parameters.

15:48.873 --> 15:52.667
Those things combined,
we had to let you go.

15:52.710 --> 15:56.337
- Erin, please surrender
your blade.

15:56.381 --> 16:00.258
<i>- I'm truly frustrated
that it didn't work out for me.</i>

16:00.301 --> 16:02.093
It's what I do,
and I do it well.

16:02.136 --> 16:04.720
I'm a talented,
skilled craftsman.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.431
And I guess I busted
under pressure.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.478
- All right, bladesmiths,
your blades have been tempered,

16:12.522 --> 16:16.190
but now it's time to turn them
into fully functional weapons

16:16.234 --> 16:18.317
by crafting
and attaching a handle

16:18.361 --> 16:20.528
from the range of materials
provided to you.

16:20.571 --> 16:23.155
You will have three hours
to accomplish this task.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.533
You can use that time
to address any flaws

16:25.576 --> 16:28.035
or issues that were identified
in your blades.

16:28.079 --> 16:30.204
After the three hours
has elapsed,

16:30.248 --> 16:31.706
your finished weapons
will be tested

16:31.749 --> 16:34.250
<i>in chopping and stabbing
paint cans</i>

16:34.294 --> 16:37.545
<i>and slicing through tatami mats.</i>

16:37.588 --> 16:38.754
Good luck, bladesmiths.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.299
Your time starts now.

16:41.342 --> 16:45.386
<i>¶ ¶</i>

16:45.430 --> 16:46.762
- My strategy going
into round two

16:46.806 --> 16:48.723
is just to keep my eye
on that clock.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.599
<i>I want to give myself no more
than an hour</i>

16:50.643 --> 16:52.560
<i>to get the blade completely
finished, ground,</i>

16:52.603 --> 16:54.312
<i>not including the handle.</i>

16:54.355 --> 16:58.566
<i>¶ ¶</i>

16:58.609 --> 17:00.693
<i>If I don't grind this knife
down the center,</i>

17:00.737 --> 17:03.738
the hard steel core is not
gonna line up on the edge.

17:03.781 --> 17:04.780
It's not gonna hold an edge.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.532
The edge is gonna be very soft,

17:06.576 --> 17:08.701
and it's gonna roll over
when they cut something with it.

17:08.745 --> 17:10.578
<i>So I need to make sure that
that hardened core</i>

17:10.621 --> 17:12.413
<i>is lining up right on
the cutting edge.</i>

17:12.457 --> 17:14.623
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:14.667 --> 17:16.584
- He's got a really nice
pattern on there,

17:16.627 --> 17:18.627
but there is wrought iron
coming down to the cutting edge.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.991
That's gonna cause a problem
with the edge retention.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.934
- Chad needs to straighten
that blade out.

17:33.978 --> 17:35.603
He's gonna try and
grind it straight.

17:35.646 --> 17:37.688
The concern with that is,
he's gonna either end up

17:37.732 --> 17:39.440
with a blade that's still
got a bend in it,

17:39.484 --> 17:41.359
or a very thin, delicate blade
that's not gonna

17:41.402 --> 17:43.194
hold up to the testing.

17:43.237 --> 17:45.112
<i>- I'm a little concerned
about my warp.</i>

17:45.156 --> 17:46.614
If the judges don't think
I can fix it,

17:46.657 --> 17:47.782
I might be eliminated.

17:47.825 --> 17:49.492
<i>I'm very worried about that.</i>

17:49.535 --> 17:51.452
- He is really removing
a lot of metal on that.

17:51.496 --> 17:52.953
- Yes, he is,
and he's doing it quickly.

17:52.997 --> 17:53.954
- Yeah.

17:53.998 --> 17:56.123
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:56.167 --> 17:57.847
- For the handle materials,
I'm looking for

17:57.877 --> 17:59.293
something that's natural,
because I would really

17:59.337 --> 18:02.129
like to burn my tang on.

18:02.173 --> 18:05.800
I want it to be long,
and I want it to be wide enough.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.885
Outside that, for this,

18:07.929 --> 18:11.806
I really don't care
what wood it is.

18:11.849 --> 18:14.100
So I'm looking around,
and then I spot in the back

18:14.143 --> 18:17.645
a little axe handle
that's sitting there.

18:17.688 --> 18:21.315
I'm just gonna take this
and put that sucker on.

18:21.359 --> 18:23.526
- He starts off with one of
his elaborate,

18:23.569 --> 18:26.487
beautiful-designed metal
for his blade,

18:26.531 --> 18:29.490
then with all that
being fixed on his blade,

18:29.534 --> 18:31.492
he goes for a simple
kind of material

18:31.536 --> 18:32.743
for his handle.

18:32.787 --> 18:35.538
Like, where are we going?

18:35.581 --> 18:36.956
- It may not be
the prettiest thing,

18:36.999 --> 18:39.083
but it'll work.

18:39.127 --> 18:41.335
I wanted to put
a metal guard on,

18:41.379 --> 18:44.672
<i>and it crossed my mind,
I'll paracord and superglue.</i>

18:44.715 --> 18:46.424
That'll work for me.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.676
- The fact that Kevin's
abandoned his guard

18:48.719 --> 18:51.554
is a little worrisome.

18:51.597 --> 18:52.888
- A little?

18:52.932 --> 18:54.181
- One hour, bladesmiths.

18:54.225 --> 18:57.017
You have one hour remaining.

18:57.061 --> 18:59.228
<i>- My handle should be pretty
easy to make.</i>

18:59.272 --> 19:01.272
The plan is to use sambar stag.

19:01.315 --> 19:05.025
<i>In the bottom inch, I'm using
a different type of horn.</i>

19:05.069 --> 19:06.485
<i>Everything's good to go.</i>

19:06.529 --> 19:08.571
Now I just got to put
that one little inch

19:08.614 --> 19:11.532
of antler on the bottom.

19:11.576 --> 19:14.577
<i>Everything's falling into place
just beautiful,</i>

19:14.620 --> 19:18.205
and then I go to peen it.

19:18.249 --> 19:19.582
<i>Bam!</i>

19:19.625 --> 19:21.375
<i>It just cracks
and falls all apart.</i>

19:21.419 --> 19:24.211
Oh!

19:24.255 --> 19:25.588
Broken.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.423
There's no saving it.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.632
What do we do?

19:28.676 --> 19:29.925
It ain't gonna look good.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.052
This could be it for me.
I could be done.

19:39.437 --> 19:41.687
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:41.731 --> 19:44.231
<i>- My deer horn handle cracks
and falls all apart.</i>

19:44.275 --> 19:45.441
Oh!

19:45.485 --> 19:46.901
There's no saving it.

19:46.944 --> 19:49.737
- Chad actually did
break his antler.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.822
- If that antler's
not supported underneath,

19:51.866 --> 19:53.407
you can get those things
to crack.

19:53.451 --> 19:56.744
- It's a hard material.
It ain't rock solid.

19:56.787 --> 19:58.287
- Well, what's the cheap way?

19:58.331 --> 19:59.914
- 45 minutes, bladesmiths.

19:59.957 --> 20:01.457
<i>- If I don't get
this handle done,</i>

20:01.501 --> 20:03.083
I could be going home.

20:03.127 --> 20:05.419
- [chuckles] Oh, my God.

20:05.463 --> 20:06.712
I can't help but laugh.

20:06.756 --> 20:08.172
I mean, can you see Chad?

20:08.216 --> 20:11.967
He's slathering that epoxy
all over.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.595
- I grab some paracord,
grab some epoxy,

20:14.639 --> 20:17.264
and I just fill in the gap
with a bunch of wraps.

20:17.308 --> 20:18.766
- It won't slide out of my hand.

20:18.809 --> 20:21.060
- No, it's gonna be stuck to it.

20:21.103 --> 20:24.063
- Took some of my grinding
powder, threw it on there,

20:24.106 --> 20:25.940
<i>and man,
it doesn't look too bad.</i>

20:25.983 --> 20:29.693
- He's just smiling right now.

20:29.737 --> 20:32.446
- It ain't pretty!

20:32.490 --> 20:33.781
- I'm working on trying to
figure out

20:33.824 --> 20:35.784
how to put a handle
on this thing.

20:35.826 --> 20:38.452
<i>There's a curve and a flare
to the back end of my handle</i>

20:38.496 --> 20:41.664
on the tang, and none of this
material is wide enough

20:41.707 --> 20:43.666
to actually fit on the knife.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.960
I've given myself a few minutes
to see if I can figure out

20:46.003 --> 20:47.628
a way that's not gonna
take me forever

20:47.672 --> 20:51.048
where I can basically splice
these two pieces together

20:51.092 --> 20:52.341
in a way that looks good.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.634
I'll grind the handle down
skinnier

20:53.678 --> 20:54.802
if that doesn't work.

20:54.845 --> 20:56.554
[chuckles]

20:56.597 --> 20:58.973
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:59.016 --> 21:00.808
- 20 minutes, bladesmiths!

21:00.851 --> 21:04.395
You have 20 minutes remaining.

21:04.438 --> 21:06.230
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:06.274 --> 21:07.815
- Another day in the park
for me.

21:07.858 --> 21:12.695
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:12.738 --> 21:15.281
<i>I get the handle done.
I got five minutes left.</i>

21:15.324 --> 21:18.659
<i>Then I realize, I still
got to sharpen this knife.</i>

21:18.703 --> 21:21.370
- We have not seen this.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.664
- Burt's actually flipped
the belt over

21:23.708 --> 21:25.833
so the paper side is out,
and he's putting

21:25.876 --> 21:27.585
buffing compound on it,
and he's using it

21:27.628 --> 21:28.961
as a fine strum.

21:29.005 --> 21:30.379
If you don't
have a leather belt,

21:30.423 --> 21:32.339
that's a trick you can do
in an emergency.

21:32.383 --> 21:34.258
- And that'll just put
a polished edge on it

21:34.302 --> 21:36.760
right at the end.

21:36.804 --> 21:39.513
- I'm happy because
the pattern looks good.

21:39.557 --> 21:41.849
I... I'm happy with it.

21:41.892 --> 21:43.350
It's unique.

21:43.394 --> 21:46.520
No one else has it going on
in their blade.

21:46.564 --> 21:48.355
<i>I dipped it into the ferric,</i>

21:48.399 --> 21:50.774
got it wiped off as best
as I could in the water,

21:50.818 --> 21:53.235
<i>and then I went over
to grab some Windex, and boom.</i>

21:53.279 --> 21:55.863
- Ten, nine, eight,

21:55.906 --> 21:57.948
seven, six,

21:57.992 --> 22:00.701
five, four, three,

22:00.745 --> 22:02.536
two, one.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.413
Bladesmiths, stop working.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.999
<i>- I wish I had an extra
ten seconds.</i>

22:07.043 --> 22:08.834
<i>The only thing I'm anxious
about is,</i>

22:08.878 --> 22:11.211
if you don't stamp out
the ferric chloride well enough,

22:11.255 --> 22:12.880
<i>it's gonna rust your blade.</i>

22:12.923 --> 22:15.049
<i>I just hope that ferric chloride</i>

22:15.092 --> 22:17.134
really got stamped out.

22:17.178 --> 22:22.556
<i>¶ ¶</i>

22:22.600 --> 22:24.058
- All right, fellow bladesmiths.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.643
This is a strength test.

22:25.686 --> 22:28.437
What I'm gonna do is take
each of your blades

22:28.481 --> 22:32.441
and do a thrust and downward
slice on one paint can

22:32.485 --> 22:35.736
and then a downward chop
on the second.

22:35.780 --> 22:38.947
Chad, you're up.
Let's have some fun.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.659
<i>- My blade,
it doesn't look pretty,</i>

22:41.702 --> 22:44.078
<i>but this is for cutting.</i>

22:44.121 --> 22:52.121
<i>¶ ¶</i>

22:55.007 --> 22:56.799
- No problem going through
the paint can at all.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.676
It's a little awkward.

22:58.719 --> 23:00.594
We still got a bit of that
warp in there,

23:00.638 --> 23:03.180
so getting that thrust in
was a little tricky,

23:03.224 --> 23:04.932
but it held up.

23:04.975 --> 23:05.975
Good job.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.436
<i>Burt, you're up next.</i>

23:09.480 --> 23:11.280
<i>- One thing I'm really
unsure of on that knife</i>

23:11.315 --> 23:12.940
<i>is I just wish that heat treat
would've been better,</i>

23:12.983 --> 23:16.443
<i>so I'm a little bit hesitant
about that.</i>

23:16.487 --> 23:24.487
<i>¶ ¶</i>

23:29.500 --> 23:31.542
- Very nice, Burt.

23:31.585 --> 23:33.919
Punctured nicely,
it's a comfortable handle

23:33.963 --> 23:35.462
with a good grip on it,

23:35.506 --> 23:37.631
was able to get a good strike
on that chop.

23:37.675 --> 23:39.216
The edge held up very nicely.

23:41.679 --> 23:44.471
<i>Kevin, you're up.
Let's cut cans.</i>

23:44.515 --> 23:46.765
<i>We don't have a fixed guard,
so I'm gonna put</i>

23:46.809 --> 23:48.767
the blade stops on to protect
my fingers

23:48.811 --> 23:50.477
from sliding up onto that edge.

23:50.521 --> 23:52.813
- Okay.

23:52.857 --> 23:55.149
<i>¶ ¶</i>

23:55.192 --> 23:57.234
- [grunts]

23:57.278 --> 24:05.278
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:09.790 --> 24:11.165
All right, Kevin.

24:11.208 --> 24:14.168
The blade is not in alignment
with the handle,

24:14.211 --> 24:16.795
so when I went to thrust
into the can,

24:16.839 --> 24:20.674
<i>the point wasn't going
where it was supposed to.</i>

24:20.718 --> 24:23.552
Got a lot of handle here too.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.054
But the blade held up.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.682
Good job.
- Thank you.

24:28.726 --> 24:32.686
- Now we're gonna move into the
sharpness test with Doug.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.730
- Okay, smiths,
I'm gonna take your blades,

24:34.774 --> 24:37.441
and I'm gonna go slash through
these rolled up tatami mats.

24:37.485 --> 24:39.026
If your blade held its edge,
it should just

24:39.069 --> 24:40.694
cut all the way through.

24:40.738 --> 24:42.237
Chad, you're up first.
Are you ready?

24:42.281 --> 24:43.864
- I'm ready.

24:43.908 --> 24:50.537
<i>¶ ¶</i>

24:50.581 --> 24:53.373
- Well, Chad, it's got
a good feel to it.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.543
Boy, did it just want to
go attack this mat right here.

24:56.587 --> 24:58.545
Nice slice through it.

24:58.589 --> 25:00.214
Cut cleanly.

25:00.257 --> 25:01.924
It will cut.
Good job.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.759
- Thank you.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.385
- Burt, you're up next.
Are you ready?

25:05.429 --> 25:06.429
- I'm ready.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.055
- Let's do this.

25:08.098 --> 25:09.515
<i>- I've just seen him cut the mat</i>

25:09.558 --> 25:12.142
with Chad's knife,
and I'm not sure

25:12.186 --> 25:15.479
<i>mine can actually be capable
of that clean a cut.</i>

25:15.523 --> 25:22.236
<i>¶ ¶</i>

25:22.279 --> 25:23.821
[sighs]

25:25.449 --> 25:29.117
- Well, Burt, this is a very
well-balanced blade.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.869
It's beautiful.
It's sharp.

25:30.913 --> 25:33.872
It cut so cleanly right through.

25:33.916 --> 25:36.959
Edge is definitely sharp
all the way through.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.752
It will cut.

25:38.796 --> 25:40.337
- Good.

25:40.381 --> 25:42.422
- Okay, Kevin, you're up next.
Are you ready?

25:42.466 --> 25:43.924
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

25:43.968 --> 25:50.597
<i>¶ ¶</i>

25:54.144 --> 25:57.020
Kevin, it is a sharp blade.

25:57.064 --> 25:58.605
It cut all the way through.

25:58.649 --> 26:00.899
It's got a good feel
and balance to it.

26:00.943 --> 26:02.776
Your handle's a little
bit thick,

26:02.820 --> 26:05.654
but for a sharpness test,
it will cut.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.489
Good job.
- Thank you.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.199
If I don't make it
to the next round,

26:09.243 --> 26:10.951
I will be missing
at the opportunity

26:10.995 --> 26:13.203
<i>to showcase my talent
in a different fashion,</i>

26:13.247 --> 26:15.372
<i>and I want to do that.</i>

26:15.416 --> 26:20.419
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:20.462 --> 26:23.463
- Well, bladesmiths,
after two rounds of competition,

26:23.507 --> 26:25.007
each of you has turned in

26:25.050 --> 26:28.302
a blade
that you can be proud of.

26:28.345 --> 26:31.722
However, only two of you
can advance to the final.

26:31.765 --> 26:34.766
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:34.810 --> 26:37.519
Now it's time for one of you
to surrender his weapon

26:37.563 --> 26:39.980
and leave the Forge.

26:40.024 --> 26:42.316
The bladesmith
leaving the Forge is...

26:51.577 --> 26:54.119
- Bladesmiths,
all three of your weapons

26:54.163 --> 26:55.329
have been tested.

26:55.372 --> 26:57.039
The judges have deliberated,

26:57.082 --> 26:58.332
and they've come to a decision.

26:58.375 --> 27:03.670
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:03.714 --> 27:05.672
Kevin, I'm sorry,

27:05.716 --> 27:08.675
your blade did not make the cut.

27:08.719 --> 27:12.054
- Kevin, you went bold
with that blade,

27:12.097 --> 27:14.848
and cheaped out on the handle.

27:14.892 --> 27:17.017
The fit of the handle
is also awkward,

27:17.061 --> 27:19.061
giving the knife
an off-balance thrust,

27:19.104 --> 27:21.229
which makes it difficult
to stab with.

27:21.273 --> 27:24.107
And a guard that's made
of paracord and glue,

27:24.151 --> 27:27.486
we just couldn't
let that go through.

27:27.529 --> 27:29.071
- Kevin,

27:29.114 --> 27:33.075
it's time for you
to surrender your weapon.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.576
<i>- I agree with the judges'
decision.</i>

27:34.620 --> 27:35.619
<i>If I was in their shoes,
I would've</i>

27:35.663 --> 27:37.037
<i>made the same decision.</i>

27:37.081 --> 27:38.921
I am, without a doubt,
gonna keep making knives

27:38.958 --> 27:41.083
and keep doing bladesmithing,
and I will get to the point

27:41.126 --> 27:42.876
where it's my sole occupation.

27:42.920 --> 27:48.548
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:48.592 --> 27:51.218
- Chad, Burt, congratulations.

27:51.261 --> 27:54.054
You've made it to the
"Forged in Fire" final.

27:54.098 --> 27:57.099
When you came to this forge,
we asked you to use our tools

27:57.142 --> 28:00.769
and our equipment to forge
a blade of your own design

28:00.813 --> 28:02.896
in your signature style.

28:02.940 --> 28:05.440
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:05.484 --> 28:08.151
to recreate an iconic blade
from history.

28:08.195 --> 28:11.321
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:11.365 --> 28:12.656
- Oh.

28:12.700 --> 28:13.907
- The shotel.

28:13.951 --> 28:16.118
- [sighs]

28:16.161 --> 28:19.246
<i>- The shotel is a blade
that originates from Abyssinia,</i>

28:19.289 --> 28:21.248
<i>part of ancient Ethiopia.</i>

28:21.291 --> 28:24.251
<i>The curve of the shotel's blade
is almost semi-circular,</i>

28:24.294 --> 28:26.753
<i>similar to the Persian shamshir.</i>

28:26.797 --> 28:29.589
<i>And its sharp double-edges
make it a highly functional</i>

28:29.633 --> 28:31.758
<i>and effective weapon in battle.</i>

28:31.802 --> 28:33.927
<i>The shape was designed
for warriors on foot</i>

28:33.971 --> 28:37.014
<i>to hook around an enemy shield
to strike vital organs</i>

28:37.057 --> 28:39.599
<i>and to dismount an enemy
from their horse.</i>

28:39.643 --> 28:42.602
<i>The shotel has also been
popularized in gaming culture,</i>

28:42.646 --> 28:46.732
<i>notably in the mythological
"Dark Souls" gaming series.</i>

28:48.986 --> 28:52.279
It must be a lethal
working version

28:52.322 --> 28:54.448
of that deadly blade.

28:54.491 --> 28:59.202
The length of the blade must be
between 26 and 29 inches.

28:59.246 --> 29:03.957
The depth of the curve
must be at least 3 1/2 inches.

29:04.001 --> 29:06.460
You will have five days
to accomplish this task

29:06.503 --> 29:08.295
at your home forges.

29:08.338 --> 29:11.214
- We have to make
an Ethiopian shotel,

29:11.258 --> 29:13.175
<i>which I just learned
how to pronounce,</i>

29:13.218 --> 29:15.302
and over the next five days,
apparently

29:15.345 --> 29:17.304
I'll learn how to make one.

29:17.347 --> 29:18.930
- When those five days
are finished,

29:18.974 --> 29:21.641
you will return and present
your finished shotels

29:21.685 --> 29:23.060
to our panel of judges.

29:23.103 --> 29:25.187
They will put those weapons
through a series

29:25.230 --> 29:29.733
<i>of dynamic and rigorous tests.</i>

29:29.777 --> 29:31.818
Only when those tests are
complete

29:31.862 --> 29:35.030
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

29:35.074 --> 29:38.950
and the recipient of $10,000.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.327
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:40.370 --> 29:42.704
We'll see you in five days.

29:42.748 --> 29:43.997
- Good luck.

29:44.041 --> 29:47.292
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:47.336 --> 29:49.211
- I'm going up against
a master bladesmith.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.004
This is what he does.
This is his living.

29:51.048 --> 29:52.964
I'm just a backyard blacksmith.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.925
<i>But the playing field
could be even.</i>

29:54.968 --> 29:57.010
<i>He's never made a shotel.</i>

29:57.054 --> 30:00.347
<i>The first thing I do today
is I got to make Damascus.</i>

30:00.390 --> 30:04.976
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:05.020 --> 30:08.563
I get to the press, first press.

30:08.607 --> 30:09.689
<i>Looking good.</i>

30:09.733 --> 30:11.483
Second press, looking good.

30:11.527 --> 30:13.360
Third press...

30:13.403 --> 30:14.736
The weld just came right off.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.947
Psh, it just split
like a sandwich.

30:16.990 --> 30:20.033
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:20.077 --> 30:21.868
I got to get control
of the situation.

30:21.912 --> 30:26.873
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:32.714 --> 30:34.214
<i>- I'm excited.</i>

30:34.258 --> 30:35.257
<i>This is the part
of the competition</i>

30:35.300 --> 30:36.758
I was looking forward to.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.385
<i>Day one, we're gonna design.</i>

30:38.428 --> 30:40.137
We're gonna make the steel.

30:40.180 --> 30:42.556
Gonna forge it into a blade.

30:42.599 --> 30:45.767
Maybe that will be it.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.562
All right, here we go.

30:48.605 --> 30:50.480
<i>I'm making the first fold
of the Damascus.</i>

30:50.524 --> 30:52.124
<i>It's probably not really
quite hot enough</i>

30:52.151 --> 30:54.401
to make the fold properly,
but I do it anyways,

30:54.444 --> 30:58.238
<i>and that sets up
this off-kilter fold</i>

30:58.282 --> 31:00.574
that's got me a little
concerned.

31:00.617 --> 31:03.743
I think I'm gonna be okay.

31:03.787 --> 31:06.121
<i>Because of this ladder pattern,
the blade will have</i>

31:06.165 --> 31:08.123
<i>what's referred
to as a chatoyancy,</i>

31:08.167 --> 31:09.749
<i>which is the illusion
of movement</i>

31:09.793 --> 31:12.252
when light plays off it
in different directions.

31:12.296 --> 31:14.629
<i>The hard thing about this
is that I'm not gonna know</i>

31:14.673 --> 31:18.425
<i>how it really feels
until I'm, like,</i>

31:18.468 --> 31:20.093
two or three days into this.

31:20.137 --> 31:24.598
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:24.641 --> 31:26.766
- There's a whole lot
I got to do.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.226
<i>I got to get the blade bent.</i>

31:28.270 --> 31:29.769
Yeah.

31:29.813 --> 31:31.271
<i>I got to shape it in
the correct from.</i>

31:31.315 --> 31:33.106
I want more bend.

31:33.150 --> 31:34.232
Tweak all the edges.

31:34.276 --> 31:36.151
Little magic in the blade.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.278
<i>Dink with that blade
till it gets good.</i>

31:38.322 --> 31:39.779
Yeah, I got to get the tip hot.

31:39.823 --> 31:41.364
I'm grinding it.
I'm going up and down.

31:41.408 --> 31:43.491
I'm cleaning it up, then, whoa!

31:43.535 --> 31:45.118
<i>I see this big ol' inclusion.</i>

31:45.162 --> 31:47.454
<i>So I keep on grinding,
keep on grinding.</i>

31:47.497 --> 31:50.123
It goes away.
Then I see another.

31:50.167 --> 31:51.458
There's the bubble.

31:51.501 --> 31:55.128
Let's see what happens
on Mr. Bubble.

31:55.172 --> 31:58.548
The inclusion could mean
failure of the blade.

31:58.592 --> 32:00.508
[grinder whirring]

32:00.552 --> 32:01.509
I don't know.
I don't...

32:01.553 --> 32:03.094
It's pretty big.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.971
I won't know until
I totally grind this out,

32:05.015 --> 32:07.098
but that inclusion,
it could be a crack.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.434
I'm a little concerned.

32:09.478 --> 32:11.478
I really got to quench
this thing

32:11.521 --> 32:12.812
to find out if it's
gonna make it,

32:12.856 --> 32:14.147
or I've got to go to plan B.

32:14.191 --> 32:17.192
[grinder whirring]

32:19.279 --> 32:21.279
<i>- Day two, critical moments,
making sure</i>

32:21.323 --> 32:22.906
<i>it's forged to shape.</i>

32:22.950 --> 32:24.491
<i>This is a shape
I've never made before.</i>

32:24.534 --> 32:26.826
I cannot get in
and just go full speed

32:26.870 --> 32:29.412
and bang it out
because by the time I realize

32:29.456 --> 32:33.083
there's a problem,
it's gonna be too late.

32:33.126 --> 32:35.835
It's just so dang ungainly.

32:35.879 --> 32:38.380
Balance,
that's a real concern for me.

32:38.423 --> 32:41.675
I want that tip to be on the
left side of that center line.

32:41.718 --> 32:44.386
<i>Not only does it have
tip and handle balance issues,</i>

32:44.429 --> 32:46.388
but it kind of has this whole,
like, left-right thing

32:46.431 --> 32:48.056
<i>because of the way
that curve sits.</i>

32:48.100 --> 32:49.391
Think we'll take it out
to the grinder

32:49.434 --> 32:51.351
and see what happens.

32:51.395 --> 32:53.353
<i>I'm going to grind
the bevels in,</i>

32:53.397 --> 32:55.522
<i>grind the tapers, and then
we're gonna heat treat it.</i>

32:55.565 --> 32:58.233
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:58.277 --> 32:59.734
I think we're good.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.404
This is where the magic happens.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.247
<i>With quenching,
there's more that can go wrong</i>

33:04.283 --> 33:07.200
<i>in one tiny span of time
than any other part of it.</i>

33:07.244 --> 33:10.328
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:10.372 --> 33:12.038
Yah!

33:12.082 --> 33:14.708
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:14.751 --> 33:16.126
I am good!

33:16.169 --> 33:18.378
Look at that.

33:18.422 --> 33:20.630
Oh, my gosh.

33:20.674 --> 33:22.882
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:22.926 --> 33:24.551
<i>- I got to get the shotel
heat treated,</i>

33:24.594 --> 33:27.137
that way I know plan A's
gonna work, move forward,

33:27.180 --> 33:29.723
or jump to plan B,
bang out another blade.

33:29.766 --> 33:33.393
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:33.437 --> 33:35.020
Whoo! Hot.

33:38.775 --> 33:40.900
<i>The Damascus worked.
The quench worked.</i>

33:40.944 --> 33:45.572
Everything just came together
beautifully on this blade.

33:45.615 --> 33:47.741
Even if I don't win,

33:47.784 --> 33:49.576
I'm really proud of this blade.

33:49.619 --> 33:50.910
It's awesome!

33:52.164 --> 33:54.247
<i>- Today's all about the handle.</i>

33:54.291 --> 33:55.874
This handle's gonna be
built in pieces

33:55.917 --> 33:58.126
<i>that are all gonna fit together
as one.</i>

33:58.170 --> 33:59.919
<i>I'm gonna do something
that I think</i>

33:59.963 --> 34:03.798
<i>is in the spirit of the
original but I like better.</i>

34:03.842 --> 34:05.925
The only way I can design it
is against my own hand,

34:05.969 --> 34:08.428
<i>but I actually paid attention
when I shook the judges' hands,</i>

34:08.472 --> 34:10.638
so that if anybody had
Oompa Loompa hands

34:10.682 --> 34:14.184
or, like, King Kong hands,
I was gonna bear that in mind.

34:14.227 --> 34:17.312
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:17.356 --> 34:18.772
All of a sudden,
it just occurs to me,

34:18.815 --> 34:20.774
what if the blade breaks?

34:20.817 --> 34:23.443
[whistles]

34:23.487 --> 34:26.613
I decided to stop
and just throw that handle

34:26.656 --> 34:30.450
on there and go out
and cut something.

34:30.494 --> 34:31.618
See what happens.

34:31.661 --> 34:35.789
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:35.832 --> 34:40.126
It really cut,
had a lot of power in the cut.

34:40.170 --> 34:42.003
<i>I mean, it's brutal.</i>

34:42.047 --> 34:43.505
It's... wahh!

34:43.548 --> 34:45.465
We laid waste to a couple
of small trees.

34:45.509 --> 34:47.175
I feel a lot better about
finishing this up now.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.259
[chuckles]

34:55.352 --> 34:59.229
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:59.272 --> 35:02.899
- Burt, Chad,
welcome back to the Forge.

35:02.943 --> 35:05.318
You've had five days
to work on your shotel,

35:05.362 --> 35:07.320
so I hope you used
your time wisely.

35:07.364 --> 35:08.822
Burt, how did it go?

35:08.865 --> 35:10.323
- Thought it went really well.

35:10.367 --> 35:12.325
<i>It was a huge challenge
to make something</i>

35:12.369 --> 35:14.411
<i>this different from anything
I've ever made.</i>

35:14.454 --> 35:16.996
<i>I've made a ladder-pattern
Damascus blade</i>

35:17.040 --> 35:18.498
<i>with an African blackwood
handle.</i>

35:18.542 --> 35:19.707
<i>I wanted it to have a little tie</i>

35:19.751 --> 35:21.709
<i>to the history of this sword.</i>

35:21.753 --> 35:23.670
I'm really excited to see
how it'll do.

35:23.713 --> 35:25.672
- Great.
Chad?

35:25.715 --> 35:27.173
- It went pretty well.

35:27.217 --> 35:29.926
<i>I made a 64-layer Damascus.</i>

35:29.970 --> 35:32.637
<i>My first try,
I knew I had to amp it up.</i>

35:32.681 --> 35:34.681
<i>I'm going against him.</i>

35:34.724 --> 35:36.099
- All right.

35:36.143 --> 35:38.143
Well, gentlemen,
both of your weapons

35:38.186 --> 35:39.686
look absolutely fantastic.

35:39.729 --> 35:42.272
But how your weapons look
is secondary

35:42.315 --> 35:45.191
to how they perform
in our weapons tests.

35:45.235 --> 35:46.776
We will now be testing
your weapons

35:46.820 --> 35:48.528
in three different trials.

35:48.572 --> 35:49.863
Doug?

35:49.906 --> 35:53.199
<i>¶ ¶</i>

35:53.243 --> 35:55.785
- Bladesmiths,
this is a strength test.

35:55.829 --> 35:58.746
The Ethiopian shotel
evolved from a sickle,

35:58.790 --> 36:01.666
an agricultural tool that
was used to harvest crops

36:01.710 --> 36:03.710
and cut plants.

36:03.753 --> 36:05.879
To test the strength
and function of your blade

36:05.922 --> 36:07.714
according to
its historic design,

36:07.757 --> 36:10.633
I will slash through
these vines.

36:10.677 --> 36:12.385
Burt, you're up.
You ready?

36:12.429 --> 36:13.386
- I'm ready.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.430
- Let's do this.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.354
- I'm nervous because cutting
through that hedge

36:17.392 --> 36:20.643
is gonna be a very fast
cutting stroke,

36:20.687 --> 36:22.353
<i>and if this thing's too heavy,</i>

36:22.397 --> 36:23.897
<i>it doesn't really matter
how sharp it is.</i>

36:23.940 --> 36:25.398
It's just not gonna work.

36:25.442 --> 36:33.406
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:41.291 --> 36:43.082
- Well, Burt, your edge held up.

36:43.126 --> 36:47.504
I don't see any deformations
or anything in there.

36:47.547 --> 36:49.255
It's got very good balance.

36:49.299 --> 36:51.174
I love the feel of your handle.

36:51.218 --> 36:52.759
The way you made it,
there's a good flare

36:52.802 --> 36:55.136
to prevent it from slipping.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.639
Cut through the vines easily.

36:57.682 --> 37:00.225
And for the strength test,
it held up.

37:00.268 --> 37:01.309
Good job, sir.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.519
- Thank you.

37:02.562 --> 37:04.322
- Chad, you're up.
Ready?

37:04.356 --> 37:05.271
- I'm ready.

37:05.315 --> 37:06.856
<i>I'm feeling good.</i>

37:06.900 --> 37:08.608
I'm thinking this blade
is gonna hold up.

37:08.652 --> 37:11.361
It's strong.
It's sharp.

37:11.404 --> 37:13.363
<i>It should hold.</i>

37:13.406 --> 37:21.406
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:31.174 --> 37:33.134
<i>The hook gets stuck
on the vines.</i>

37:33.176 --> 37:34.842
<i>I'm thinking, "Oh, gosh.</i>

37:34.886 --> 37:37.679
I went the wrong direction
with this blade."

37:37.722 --> 37:39.347
- Well, Chad,
for the strength test,

37:39.391 --> 37:41.432
it looks like your edge held.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.309
No deformations.

37:43.353 --> 37:45.144
Handle feels good.

37:45.188 --> 37:46.729
And it's expected with
the hook design,

37:46.773 --> 37:49.190
it would catch on that.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.651
This, sir, is a strong blade.

37:51.695 --> 37:52.986
Good job.

37:53.029 --> 37:54.487
- Thank you.

37:54.531 --> 37:57.699
- Next test is the kill test.

37:57.742 --> 37:59.993
To test the lethality
of your blade,

38:00.036 --> 38:02.328
I will attack
this ballistics dummy.

38:02.372 --> 38:04.038
Burt, you're up.
You ready?

38:04.082 --> 38:05.164
- I'm ready.

38:05.208 --> 38:13.172
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:19.389 --> 38:21.848
- Well, Burt.
[chuckles]

38:21.891 --> 38:23.683
It's a sharp blade to penetrate

38:23.727 --> 38:25.852
all the way through
a new slice through the clavicle

38:25.895 --> 38:27.895
into the breastbone.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.607
Obviously,

38:30.650 --> 38:33.776
probably gutted him pretty well.

38:33.820 --> 38:36.404
It will kill.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.864
Chad, you're up.
Are you ready?

38:37.907 --> 38:39.198
- I'm ready.

38:39.242 --> 38:47.206
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:59.596 --> 39:01.721
- That really dug into
this dummy,

39:01.765 --> 39:03.890
and it wouldn't let him go.

39:03.933 --> 39:07.560
Got a good laceration
on the side.

39:07.604 --> 39:10.897
This will also kill.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.066
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

39:13.109 --> 39:15.818
- Next is the sharpness test.

39:15.862 --> 39:18.404
To test the sharpness
of the inside edge

39:18.448 --> 39:20.406
of your blade,
I will take your weapon,

39:20.450 --> 39:22.909
and I will slash through
the slab of meat.

39:22.952 --> 39:24.494
Burt, you're up.
You ready?

39:24.537 --> 39:26.204
- Ready.

39:26.247 --> 39:27.497
I'm a little concerned
'cause I can't tell

39:27.540 --> 39:28.790
looking at that big
piece of meat,

39:28.833 --> 39:30.375
does it have ribs in it?

39:30.418 --> 39:32.752
Or is it just solid meat?

39:32.796 --> 39:34.253
<i>I don't know.</i>

39:34.297 --> 39:36.297
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:44.057 --> 39:46.307
- To test the sharpness
of the inside edge

39:46.351 --> 39:48.559
of your blade,
I will take your weapon,

39:48.603 --> 39:51.270
and I will slice through
this slab of meat.

39:51.314 --> 39:52.647
Burt, you're up.
You ready?

39:52.691 --> 39:53.856
- Ready.

39:53.900 --> 40:01.900
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:04.536 --> 40:07.453
- This is a very sharp blade.

40:07.497 --> 40:11.165
No indentations,
no deformations.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.167
It will cut.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.877
- Thank you.

40:14.921 --> 40:17.130
- Chad, it's your turn.
You ready?

40:17.173 --> 40:18.881
- I'm ready.

40:18.925 --> 40:23.344
Burt's blade performed
perfect on the sharpness test,

40:23.388 --> 40:25.805
<i>and it has me nervous.</i>

40:25.849 --> 40:33.849
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:33.898 --> 40:35.815
<i>The blade not going
through the meat</i>

40:35.859 --> 40:38.484
<i>is not making any sense.</i>

40:38.528 --> 40:40.695
I know that blade was sharp.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.489
- Well, Chad,
it didn't slice through

40:43.533 --> 40:45.825
the way I was hoping it would.

40:45.869 --> 40:48.828
The inside edge isn't
razor-sharp.

40:48.872 --> 40:52.165
It did cut through a little bit,
but then again,

40:52.208 --> 40:54.000
because of your design
being a hook,

40:54.043 --> 40:56.502
it got caught up on the meat.

40:56.546 --> 40:59.547
- Bladesmiths, our round three
weapons testing

40:59.591 --> 41:00.840
is complete.

41:00.884 --> 41:02.675
The judges will now
take some time

41:02.719 --> 41:05.178
to deliberate about your blades.

41:05.221 --> 41:07.096
Thank you.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.766
<i>- I feel really good now that
the testing is over.</i>

41:09.809 --> 41:12.602
<i>No matter what the judges say,
I'm happy with the result</i>

41:12.645 --> 41:14.729
because, you know,
I've accomplished

41:14.773 --> 41:18.357
what I wanted to come here for,
which was to challenge myself.

41:18.401 --> 41:20.151
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:20.195 --> 41:23.070
- Burt, Chad, in the final round

41:23.114 --> 41:25.531
of this competition,
you were given five days

41:25.575 --> 41:30.244
at your home forge to design and
fabricate Ethiopian shotels.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.496
J?

41:31.539 --> 41:33.206
- Well, Burt, I love the pattern

41:33.249 --> 41:34.957
<i>and the steel in your blade.</i>

41:35.001 --> 41:36.876
<i>And then, with that
edge geometry you put on that</i>

41:36.920 --> 41:38.252
<i>and the heat treat, you've made</i>

41:38.296 --> 41:40.213
a very, very
effective weapon as well.

41:40.256 --> 41:42.048
- Thank you.

41:42.091 --> 41:44.884
- Chad, the shotel is designed
to be a reach-around weapon,

41:44.928 --> 41:47.553
<i>and that, indeed,
is a reach-around tool.</i>

41:47.597 --> 41:52.266
<i>The curvature of your blade
allows it to hook all the way.</i>

41:52.310 --> 41:55.478
- Well, gentlemen,
there can only be one

41:55.522 --> 42:00.274
"Forged in Fire" champion.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.401
Burt, congratulations.

42:02.445 --> 42:04.946
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.907
- Thank you.

42:07.951 --> 42:10.952
- Chad, your shotel did not
make the cut.

42:10.995 --> 42:14.747
- Chad, your shotel was designed
to go around a shield

42:14.791 --> 42:17.667
and puncture deeply,
but it's also that hook

42:17.710 --> 42:20.628
that prevented you from making
it a very good slashing weapon.

42:20.672 --> 42:24.298
- Please surrender your shotel.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.008
- Chad, thanks so much.

42:26.052 --> 42:28.094
- I've come a long way.

42:28.137 --> 42:31.472
<i>My creativity has been awakened
doing things I've never done,</i>

42:31.516 --> 42:33.516
and I'm proud of that.

42:33.560 --> 42:36.769
- Burt, congratulations, you are
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

42:36.813 --> 42:40.940
And that title comes
with a check for $10,000.

42:40.984 --> 42:43.025
[applause]
- Thank you.

42:43.069 --> 42:45.194
I won!
I won.

42:45.238 --> 42:48.030
- It's got all
the historic aspects

42:48.074 --> 42:49.615
that the shotel should have.

42:49.659 --> 42:52.159
But it's really got your
signature style on it.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.787
- This taught me that I can
do something

42:54.831 --> 42:56.664
completely outside
my comfort zone,

42:56.708 --> 42:58.666
and I can figure it out.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.459
<i>Guys, I did it.</i>

43:00.503 --> 43:02.461
Kids, you can do it.

43:02.505 --> 43:03.462
Take risks.

43:03.506 --> 43:08.467
