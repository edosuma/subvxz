WEBVTT

00:01.265 --> 00:04.126
When we started this thing
I was just doing it to kiss your ass

00:04.445 --> 00:05.712
so Jessica would forgive me,

00:05.747 --> 00:06.747
but you're the real deal.

00:06.748 --> 00:08.215
As far as I can tell,
Jack Soloff

00:08.249 --> 00:09.689
is holding up his end
of the bargain.

00:09.717 --> 00:10.984
He's doing more than that.

00:11.019 --> 00:12.786
He just sent out
an email nominating you

00:12.820 --> 00:14.054
- for junior partner.
- What?

00:14.088 --> 00:15.322
I'm not sending out
a press release

00:15.356 --> 00:18.158
announcing Mike Ross of Harvard
just got promoted.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.293
What is this?

00:19.327 --> 00:20.927
Am I mistaken, or did we
not have this discussion?

00:21.152 --> 00:22.534
Don't call me again.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.253
You need to tell Louis you've
been sleeping with Esther.

00:24.288 --> 00:25.487
We slept together
one time.

00:25.489 --> 00:26.622
What difference
does that make?

00:26.674 --> 00:28.094
You promised him
you wouldn't do it at all.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.294
I need to tell you something.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.063
- You made a promise to me!
- I'm telling you.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.298
Because he's so messed up
from whatever goddamn thing

00:33.334 --> 00:34.633
happened to him in his pathetic
childhood, he can't--

00:34.685 --> 00:35.868
Shut the hell up!

00:35.903 --> 00:36.903
[both grunting]

00:39.974 --> 00:40.974

00:59.443 --> 01:01.076
Get me Jerry Myers
on the phone.

01:01.112 --> 01:02.878
Jerry Myers?

01:03.207 --> 01:05.541
- Louis, what happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

01:05.593 --> 01:06.676
Harvey took
a goddamn swing at me.

01:06.711 --> 01:08.661
- That's what happened.
- Oh, my God.

01:08.696 --> 01:10.817
Yeah, "Oh, my God," I'm gonna
sue the shit out of him.

01:10.847 --> 01:12.213
Okay, Louis, you're hurt.

01:12.248 --> 01:14.081
The first thing you need to do
is get some ice and calm down.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.217
Did you not just hear me?

01:16.219 --> 01:19.687
He hit me and then he threw me
into a coffee table,

01:19.722 --> 01:22.223
so I am going to
sue the shit out of him!

01:22.258 --> 01:23.574
I don't think suing Harvey
is the answer.

01:23.626 --> 01:26.560
Of course you don't,
because you want to protect him

01:26.562 --> 01:30.585
like you did when you lied to me
about what he did to Esther.

01:30.685 --> 01:33.753
Listen to me: I told Harvey
to tell you himself.

01:33.755 --> 01:36.322
And I lied to you because I knew
something like this would happen

01:36.374 --> 01:38.308
if you didn't hear it
directly from him.

01:38.343 --> 01:40.693
Well, it did happen, Donna.

01:43.698 --> 01:46.199
Now get me Jerry Myers
on the phone.

01:46.234 --> 01:48.368
You want me to do that,
I will.

01:50.271 --> 01:53.973
But you've always said
we're a family,

01:54.009 --> 01:56.909
and families keep things
like this in the family.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:06.658 --> 02:08.640
I'm not sure if
congratulations are in order,

02:08.676 --> 02:09.776
but since we
have no other choice,

02:09.811 --> 02:12.178
I'm going to choose
congratulations.

02:12.214 --> 02:13.830
- You saw the memo?
- I did.

02:13.882 --> 02:15.215
You're making partner.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.150
(Mike)
No, Rachel, I'm not.

02:17.185 --> 02:18.251
What do you mean?

02:18.303 --> 02:20.954
Jessica told me
to turn it down.

02:20.989 --> 02:22.709
Said it would draw
too much attention to me.

02:23.188 --> 02:24.620
That's crazy.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.072
If you turn it down, you'll draw
even more attention to yourself.

02:26.124 --> 02:27.240
(Mike) That's exactly
what I told her.

02:27.292 --> 02:28.574
And what did she say?

02:28.626 --> 02:29.959
She said that if I'm smart
enough to be a lawyer

02:29.995 --> 02:31.661
without going to law school,
I should be smart enough

02:31.696 --> 02:33.262
to come up with an excuse
to turn it down.

02:33.298 --> 02:34.330
Oh, that's bullshit.

02:34.366 --> 02:37.166
You think I don't want this?

02:37.672 --> 02:40.039
I do.

02:40.074 --> 02:43.776
But we've always known
I was never gonna make partner.

02:43.778 --> 02:45.377
Okay.
What are you gonna do?

02:45.577 --> 02:48.812
I am gonna do the exact
opposite of what I usually do.

02:48.912 --> 02:50.645
Instead of trying
to prove Jessica wrong,

02:50.680 --> 02:52.330
I'm gonna come up
with a legitimate excuse

02:52.382 --> 02:55.650
for why I can't accept it.

02:55.685 --> 02:57.752
[knocking on door]

02:57.788 --> 02:59.487
Jessica,

02:59.523 --> 03:01.222
if I knew you were coming over,

03:01.224 --> 03:03.024
I would have made us
some tequila and eggs.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.576
And I would have
thrown them in your face.

03:04.611 --> 03:05.931
Well, that doesn't
seem very nice.

03:05.946 --> 03:07.529
I cooked them just like you
like them.

03:07.531 --> 03:09.197
You think this is funny?

03:09.512 --> 03:10.845
You assaulted a name partner.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.513
And I'm making jokes
because I don't want to hear it,

03:12.565 --> 03:13.781
because he got what he deserved.

03:13.817 --> 03:15.600
I don't care if he
deserved a court martial.

03:15.635 --> 03:18.753
That kind of behavior cannot
exist in my firm!

03:18.788 --> 03:20.855
- You mean our firm?
- If it's our firm,

03:20.890 --> 03:23.124
then it's Louis's firm, too.

03:23.402 --> 03:25.703
Okay, you made your point.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.820
I won't do it again.

03:26.872 --> 03:28.706
You think I came all the way
down here

03:28.708 --> 03:30.140
just to give you a speech?

03:30.176 --> 03:32.376
You're taking two weeks
starting tomorrow.

03:32.411 --> 03:33.677
Me going on vacation

03:33.713 --> 03:35.446
isn't gonna stop Louis
from coming at me.

03:35.955 --> 03:37.772
Yes, it is,
because if you set foot

03:37.807 --> 03:39.757
anywhere near the office
in the next two weeks,

03:39.792 --> 03:42.226
I guarantee he will call
for a three-month suspension.

03:42.261 --> 03:43.261
Then don't let him.

03:43.262 --> 03:44.712
Harvey, there are
bylaws in place,

03:44.747 --> 03:47.631
and the only way to stop him
is you being on vacation.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.033
The only problem
with that is,

03:49.376 --> 03:51.276
everyone knows
I don't take vacations.

03:51.328 --> 03:52.328
Oh.

03:52.362 --> 03:55.580
Then why am I
holding your request

03:55.582 --> 03:57.966
that you filled out
two months ago?

03:58.018 --> 03:59.584
Louis is never going
to buy that.

03:59.620 --> 04:02.220
I don't give a shit
whether he buys it or not.

04:02.256 --> 04:04.156
But before you go
on your little trip,

04:04.191 --> 04:06.825
you're going to go to him
with your tail between your legs

04:06.860 --> 04:10.896
and tell him
that you were 100% wrong.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.759
Jessica, hey.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.060
What can I do for you?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.930
Well, you can tell me
why you nominated Mike Ross

04:25.982 --> 04:28.499
for junior partner and didn't
think to run it by me.

04:28.551 --> 04:30.201
It's an open nomination.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.319
I didn't think I had to.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.004
I didn't say you had to.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.823
- I asked you why you didn't.
- I don't understand.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.171
You were the one
who forced him to work with me.

04:38.197 --> 04:41.015
I said work with him,
not nominate him behind my back

04:41.067 --> 04:42.533
just to stick it to Harvey.

04:42.568 --> 04:46.687
Jessica, how many times are we
gonna have this conversation?

04:46.723 --> 04:49.056
You gave me a chance
to make peace and I took it.

04:49.108 --> 04:50.858
And I still haven't heard
one good reason

04:50.910 --> 04:52.743
why Mike shouldn't be promoted.

04:52.779 --> 04:57.031
Oh, I didn't say he didn't
deserve to be partner.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.700
Then how about
I retract my memo

04:59.702 --> 05:01.702
and let Harvey
nominate him instead?

05:01.704 --> 05:04.371
Unless there's some reason
why you don't want that either.

05:04.373 --> 05:06.624
Because instead of talking
to me about this,

05:06.676 --> 05:09.543
you should be talking to me
about what happened last night

05:09.545 --> 05:11.545

- How's it going?
- Not great.

05:55.191 --> 05:57.057
(Rachel) You haven't found a way
to turn down the nomination?

05:57.059 --> 05:59.226
Oh, I've found 15 ways
to turn it down.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.228
But none of them
are good enough.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.614
Come on, one of them
has to be good enough.

06:03.649 --> 06:05.316
Rachel, it's not
about the excuse,

06:05.368 --> 06:07.234
it's about me being able
to look these people in the eye

06:07.286 --> 06:08.652
and convince them
that it's true,

06:08.704 --> 06:10.120
and I can't do that.

06:10.156 --> 06:12.072
Okay.

06:12.124 --> 06:13.407
What are you gonna do?

06:13.409 --> 06:14.792
I don't know.

06:14.827 --> 06:17.044
(Jessica)
I do.

06:17.079 --> 06:19.546
You're doing this.

06:19.582 --> 06:20.714
As managing partner,

06:20.750 --> 06:23.334
I am officially giving
you your first case.

06:23.386 --> 06:26.086
- Oh my God.
- What?

06:26.138 --> 06:28.839
It's tradition
that the managing partner

06:28.891 --> 06:32.726
to give all new junior partners
their first case.

06:32.762 --> 06:34.812
- Is that what this is?
- Yes, it is.

06:34.847 --> 06:36.730
Congratulations, Mike.

06:36.766 --> 06:38.315
It may not be what I wanted,

06:38.351 --> 06:40.434
but I really did mean it
when I said you deserve it.

06:40.436 --> 06:43.320
Thank you, Jessica.

06:47.326 --> 06:48.742
I can't believe
that just really happened.

06:48.778 --> 06:53.030
You are the youngest junior
partner the firm has ever had.

06:53.082 --> 06:56.583
Mike, I'm so proud of you.

06:56.619 --> 06:58.952
Well, that means there's
only one thing left to do.

06:59.004 --> 07:00.871
Rachel Elizabeth Zane,

07:00.923 --> 07:04.792
will you be the associate
on my first case as partner?

07:04.844 --> 07:08.295
Yes.
Yes.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.632
A thousand times, yes.

07:11.684 --> 07:12.766
I don't understand.

07:12.802 --> 07:15.936
Are you saying
you're sorry you hit Louis?

07:15.971 --> 07:19.306
I'm saying I'm sorry
I didn't punch him harder.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.808
In that case, I think taking
two weeks off

07:20.810 --> 07:22.059
is the best thing right now.

07:22.111 --> 07:23.026
Because your emotions

07:23.079 --> 07:24.545
are completely ruling you.

07:24.580 --> 07:27.314
Wanting to shut Louis up
isn't being ruled by emotions.

07:27.349 --> 07:28.515
It's being human.

07:28.551 --> 07:30.117
And there are other ways you
could have tried to do that.

07:30.152 --> 07:31.852
- Such as?
- Walking out the door, for one.

07:31.887 --> 07:33.587
I'm not walking
out of my own office.

07:33.622 --> 07:34.705
Why not?

07:34.740 --> 07:36.389
Because when someone
points a gun at you,

07:36.489 --> 07:38.055
you don't turn around
and run away.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.825
You take it out of their hand
and you point it right back.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.493
Well, sometimes the best way
to get someone

07:42.528 --> 07:46.263
to stop firing bullets at you
is to take off your armor.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.149
What the hell kind of bullets
are you talking about?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.667
(Dr. Agard)
Emotional ones.

07:50.251 --> 07:53.652
Harvey, Louis lashed out at you
because he was feeling pain,

07:53.688 --> 07:56.188
and instead of showing you his
hurt, he covered it with anger.

07:56.223 --> 07:57.756
Well, that's his problem,
not mine.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.892
Actually, I'd say you two
have exactly the same problem.

07:59.927 --> 08:01.126
Excuse me?

08:01.162 --> 08:03.310
You did the same thing to him
that he did to you.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.530
Instead of showing your hurt,
you lashed out in anger.

08:05.546 --> 08:07.379
The only difference is,
is that you did it with fists.

08:07.381 --> 08:08.680
He did it with words.

08:08.715 --> 08:10.866
Are you saying that I should
tell him I'm in therapy

08:10.918 --> 08:12.050
and talk about
my issues with him

08:12.085 --> 08:14.819
so we can sit around
singing <i> Kumbayah?</i>

08:15.240 --> 08:17.140
I'm saying that if you think
Louis should be sorry

08:17.175 --> 08:18.942
for lashing out at you,
the least you can do

08:18.977 --> 08:21.644
is apologize
for lashing back at him.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.967
Louis.
How are you?

08:31.002 --> 08:32.669
Cut the small talk.
I'm not interested.

08:32.703 --> 08:34.804
In that case,
what can I do for you?

08:34.856 --> 08:37.173
You can start by telling me
how Harvey's being punished.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.726
- That's between me and Harvey.
- That's funny.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.977
When he was attacking me,
it was between me and Harvey,

08:42.013 --> 08:43.395
and I want to know
what you're gonna do about it.

08:43.448 --> 08:45.448
And I just said, it's none
of your business.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.733
Then as managing partner,
you should know

08:46.768 --> 08:48.451
that I'm suing
your favorite son

08:48.486 --> 08:51.221
for assault and battery.

08:51.727 --> 08:54.261
Louis, you haven't
filed that yet,

08:54.296 --> 08:56.763
so why don't you tell me
what the hell you really want?

08:56.799 --> 08:58.865
I want Harvey suspended.

08:58.867 --> 09:01.885
Three months, no pay,
no access to clients.

09:01.937 --> 09:03.503
That's not punishing Harvey.

09:03.539 --> 09:04.705
That's punishing all of us.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.022
Well, then I'll do it myself,

09:06.058 --> 09:07.874
which I have the right
to do under the bylaws.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.976
Louis, I was hoping
you'd calm down.

09:10.012 --> 09:12.512
But if you still feel
this way in two weeks,

09:12.548 --> 09:13.747
there's nothing
I can do about it.

09:13.782 --> 09:15.853
Two weeks? What the hell
are you talking about?

09:15.953 --> 09:17.897
You haven't heard.
Harvey's on vacation.

09:17.997 --> 09:19.530
Bullshit Harvey's
on vacation.

09:19.565 --> 09:20.798
Harvey doesn't
take vacations.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.783
Louis, you wanted him gone,
and he's gone.

09:22.835 --> 09:26.170
And I have his signed
requisition right here.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.505
I don't just want him gone.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.790
I want him humiliated
in front of the whole firm,

09:29.825 --> 09:31.592
not lying on a beach
in Turks and Caicos

09:31.644 --> 09:34.403
laughing at some fraudulent
requisition you concocted.

09:34.503 --> 09:36.670
Oh, that's a nasty
allegation, Louis.

09:36.672 --> 09:37.988
Do you have proof?

09:38.023 --> 09:39.739
You know what, Jessica,
this is no different than me

09:39.775 --> 09:41.458
putting Harvey's salary
in the copy machine.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.109
Oh, it's entirely
different, Louis.

09:43.145 --> 09:45.228
You did that to rip us apart,

09:45.280 --> 09:47.480
and I'm doing this
to keep us together.

09:47.516 --> 09:49.099
So why don't you walk the hell
out my office

09:49.151 --> 09:52.135
and think very carefully
about how you want to play this?

09:58.117 --> 10:00.584
All right, before they get here,
let's get our facts straight.

10:00.619 --> 10:02.736
Easy, our client's being
acquired by Google,

10:02.771 --> 10:04.588
but Optela Software
has a buy option.

10:04.623 --> 10:06.006
Claims to have a buy option.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.925
It actually expired
six months ago.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.660
They why are we
having this meeting?

10:09.662 --> 10:12.062
Because their lawyers
don't know we know that,

10:12.097 --> 10:14.201
and they're hoping to get
something to go away.

10:14.301 --> 10:17.085
Man, I have so much
to teach you.

10:17.087 --> 10:19.071
What, are you my boss now?

10:19.106 --> 10:20.706
Oh, how is that different
than before?

10:20.758 --> 10:23.792
I could leave
you high and dry right now.

10:23.794 --> 10:27.579
You know that, right?

10:27.631 --> 10:28.714
Shit.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.132
Mike, it was a joke.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.433
Rachel, I need you to handle
this meeting by yourself.

10:31.485 --> 10:33.969
- What? What's wrong?
- Their lawyer just got here.

10:34.004 --> 10:35.004
Her?

10:35.005 --> 10:35.937
She used to work
at a nonprofit

10:35.939 --> 10:37.052
when I was a bike messenger,
all right?

10:37.152 --> 10:38.152
We went out a few times.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.450
Mike, please.
I can handle that--

10:39.471 --> 10:42.072
No, no, no, she knows
I didn't go to law school.

10:42.124 --> 10:43.623
- What?
- If she sees me,

10:43.675 --> 10:44.891
she's gonna know
I'm not a lawyer, all right?

10:44.893 --> 10:46.059
I need you
to handle this meeting.

10:46.111 --> 10:47.560
- Can you do that?
- No, no, no--Mike, please.

10:47.612 --> 10:48.762
You have to give me a second
to process what you're saying.

10:48.797 --> 10:49.713
Rachel, I don't
have a second.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.599
- I need you to do this.
- Okay.

10:52.601 --> 10:54.517
Okay.

10:59.753 --> 11:00.919
Hi.

11:00.971 --> 11:02.937
- Hi.
- Claire Bowden.

11:02.939 --> 11:05.006
Rachel Zane.

11:05.042 --> 11:06.107
Shall we get to it?

11:06.143 --> 11:07.175
Yes, definitely.

11:07.227 --> 11:09.411
Let's...let's get to it.

11:09.446 --> 11:10.829
First of all,
I need to inform you

11:10.864 --> 11:13.048
that we are prepared
to move forward with a TRO,

11:13.100 --> 11:14.937
unless, of course, your client
has had a change of heart.

11:15.037 --> 11:16.270
You can do that.

11:16.305 --> 11:19.456
I just don't see any judge
granting you a TRO

11:19.492 --> 11:21.342
given that your option
has expired.

11:21.394 --> 11:23.394
Actually, it hasn't.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.719
This is a record
of a phone call

11:31.755 --> 11:33.454
between our client and yours.

11:33.490 --> 11:34.705
A phone call during which

11:34.758 --> 11:37.091
our client agreed to fix bugs
in your client's software

11:37.143 --> 11:38.583
in exchange
for a five-year extension

11:38.595 --> 11:40.161
of our purchase option.

11:40.163 --> 11:42.146
I'm confused.
Do...

11:42.182 --> 11:45.077
Do you actually want to buy
our client's company?

11:45.177 --> 11:46.843
Yes, if there's
a deal happening,

11:46.878 --> 11:49.762
we want to be included
in a meaningful way.

11:52.416 --> 11:53.632
I'm sorry.

11:54.123 --> 11:56.723
I'm not authorized
to include you in any deal.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.326
Then pick up the phone
and call your client.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.679
I understand.

12:02.715 --> 12:04.498
You're not authorized to do
that either because a partner

12:04.550 --> 12:06.458
dropped this in your lap
in the 11th hour.

12:06.558 --> 12:08.558
You have no idea.

12:08.593 --> 12:10.026
No, I've been there before.

12:10.061 --> 12:11.701
But I need something
to take to my client.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.630
So, get back to me
as soon as you can?

12:13.665 --> 12:15.448
Yes, absolutely.

12:15.483 --> 12:17.901
Great.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.535
By the way,

12:19.571 --> 12:22.438
how old is the partner
on this case?

12:22.474 --> 12:23.640
Why would you ask that?

12:23.675 --> 12:25.808
Because I noticed that
his name was Michael Ross,

12:25.844 --> 12:27.677
and I went out
with a Mike Ross once.

12:27.679 --> 12:29.399
I was just wondering
if it was the same guy.

12:29.414 --> 12:33.349
Because if it is, he really
turned his life around.

12:33.351 --> 12:37.420
I...I'm sure how old he is.

12:37.455 --> 12:39.422
This is the first time
we've had a case together.

12:39.424 --> 12:42.759
So I--maybe he's about 45?

12:42.811 --> 12:45.261
- Oh, definitely not him.
- Sorry.

12:45.313 --> 12:46.312
Oh, you don't have
to be sorry.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.931
I was just wondering.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.066
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

13:04.771 --> 13:05.871
How'd it go?

13:05.906 --> 13:07.439
- Not well.
- What happened?

13:07.441 --> 13:10.275
What happened was
their buy option didn't expire

13:10.311 --> 13:13.195
because it turns out
we made a deal to extend it.

13:13.230 --> 13:15.781
Okay, yeah,
that complicates things.

13:15.816 --> 13:17.983
They're gonna want to squeeze us
for more money to go away,

13:18.018 --> 13:21.920
but it's not that big a deal.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.618
It's not that big a deal?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.421
It's not that big a deal?

13:28.457 --> 13:30.257
You practically ran
from that conference room

13:30.292 --> 13:32.259
to come and hide in here
and left me to deal with a woman

13:32.294 --> 13:33.660
who knows your secret,

13:33.695 --> 13:35.332
and you're gonna tell me
that it's not that big a deal.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.966
I meant having to pay off
Optela is not that big a deal.

13:38.002 --> 13:39.668
You didn't even tell me
how she knows your secret.

13:39.703 --> 13:41.353
She doesn't know
my secret, all right?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.521
I told her I went
to law school,

13:42.573 --> 13:44.306
and she found out I didn't.

13:44.537 --> 13:45.753
If she sees me now,

13:45.805 --> 13:47.472
she's gonna look into me
and then she'll know it.

13:47.507 --> 13:48.573
And why did you tell her

13:48.575 --> 13:50.041
that you went to law school
in the first place?

13:50.169 --> 13:51.852
- Rachel, it's not important.
- It's important to me.

13:51.887 --> 13:53.137
Because I wanted
to impress her,

13:53.172 --> 13:56.240
and being a bike messenger
wasn't gonna do it.

13:56.642 --> 13:58.409
So you lied to her
to get a date?

13:58.444 --> 14:00.177
Yes, I did.

14:00.212 --> 14:03.614
Well, you're not the only person
who's lied to her now.

14:03.649 --> 14:04.649
What does that mean?

14:04.650 --> 14:06.984
What it means is,
she asked me about you,

14:07.019 --> 14:10.220
and I had to lie
to keep her from thinking

14:10.256 --> 14:12.923
that you're the same Mike Ross
that she knew before.

14:12.975 --> 14:15.326
Rachel, I'm sorry.
I...

14:15.361 --> 14:18.245
- Where are you going?
- To work on your case.

14:23.716 --> 14:25.816
As for the aforementioned case,

14:25.818 --> 14:27.451
send our client
his practice depo,

14:27.486 --> 14:29.853
and underline
all self-incriminating things

14:29.889 --> 14:31.889
that he's not supposed
to say under oath.

14:31.891 --> 14:33.190
Idiot.

14:33.242 --> 14:34.825
Moving on to...

14:34.860 --> 14:35.959
Donna, call security.

14:35.995 --> 14:38.095
I do not feel safe
in my own office.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.596
Donna went home.

14:39.632 --> 14:40.614
I'm here to speak
to you alone.

14:40.649 --> 14:41.965
Why? So you can have
no witnesses

14:42.001 --> 14:43.033
the next time you attack me?

14:43.069 --> 14:45.269
No, so I could apologize
to you in private.

14:45.304 --> 14:46.587
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

14:46.639 --> 14:47.771
You're not gonna apologize
your way out of this one.

14:47.807 --> 14:49.747
I'm not here to
get out of anything.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.246
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.981
I flew off the handle, and
I shouldn't have punched you.

14:53.016 --> 14:54.449
You didn't just punch me.
You attacked me.

14:54.485 --> 14:55.417
- Louis--
- Bullshit.

14:55.419 --> 14:56.419
This is all bullshit.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.320
There is something
wrong with you,

14:58.355 --> 15:00.922
and there is nothing that you
could ever possibly say to me--

15:00.958 --> 15:03.291
I have been seeing
a psychiatrist.

15:03.539 --> 15:04.972
What?
No, you haven't.

15:05.007 --> 15:06.373
This is some kind of trick.

15:06.408 --> 15:10.344
I've been seeing someone
to get help for panic attacks.

15:10.379 --> 15:13.013
You've been
having panic attacks?

15:13.048 --> 15:15.115
- Yes.
- Where?

15:15.150 --> 15:16.066
Look, I don't want
to get into it.

15:16.118 --> 15:17.118
(Louis)
Where?

15:19.898 --> 15:21.631
In the office.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.766
When?

15:23.802 --> 15:25.835
They happen when they happen.

15:25.871 --> 15:27.103
Louis,

15:27.138 --> 15:29.706
I am telling you the truth.

15:33.068 --> 15:34.368
My God.
How long have they--

15:34.403 --> 15:36.636
They started
a few months ago.

15:36.672 --> 15:38.555
A few--when Donna left?

15:38.607 --> 15:40.140
Yes, when Donna left.

15:40.175 --> 15:43.443
But it isn't really
about Donna.

15:43.479 --> 15:46.813
That was a trigger--at least
that's what they're telling me.

15:46.849 --> 15:48.582
It goes deeper.

15:48.617 --> 15:49.617
My family,

15:49.618 --> 15:52.536
my relationships.

15:56.132 --> 15:59.100
Let's just say I'm trying
to work through some shit.

15:59.135 --> 16:01.702
So when I said those things,
it struck a nerve.

16:01.738 --> 16:03.888
Oh, it did more
than that, Louis.

16:03.940 --> 16:04.940
It hurt.

16:04.941 --> 16:06.240
You hurt me too, Harvey.

16:06.276 --> 16:07.809
I know, and I'm sorry.

16:07.811 --> 16:08.943
And it's not an excuse,

16:08.978 --> 16:10.912
but I wanted you to know
why I did what I did

16:10.947 --> 16:15.650
and where it was
coming from.

16:15.685 --> 16:17.318
You're not really going
to Turks and Caicos, are you?

16:17.353 --> 16:19.320
I don't know, but I had
therapy this afternoon,

16:19.355 --> 16:20.555
and I spent
the rest of the day

16:20.557 --> 16:25.960
trying to figure out
the best way to do this.

16:25.995 --> 16:30.498
Louis, I'm sorry for Esther.

16:30.533 --> 16:33.034
I'm sorry for lying to you.

16:33.069 --> 16:38.339
And I'm sorry
that I attacked you.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.834
I accept your apology, Harvey.

16:41.843 --> 16:43.610
Thank you, Louis.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.553
So you're not gonna try
and suspend me?

16:53.588 --> 16:55.054
Suspend you?

16:55.449 --> 16:57.749
Jessica was sure
you'd want to suspend me.

16:57.801 --> 17:01.486
Jessica didn't know that you
were gonna say what you said.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.620
As a matter of fact,
I know Jessica

17:02.673 --> 17:05.156
only sent you on vacation
to defuse the situation,

17:05.192 --> 17:07.425
so I think you should
come back tomorrow.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.227
- You sure?
- Yes.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.428
They're announcing
Mike's partnership,

17:10.480 --> 17:13.464
and I wouldn't want you
to miss that.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.401
- I appreciate that, Louis.
- It's the least I can do.

17:33.048 --> 17:34.614
(Mike) Can I talk to you

17:34.650 --> 17:36.216
If it's about you
becoming senior partner,

17:36.251 --> 17:38.185
I think it's
a little premature.

17:41.824 --> 17:42.889
We may have a problem.

May or do?

17:44.545 --> 17:46.245
The lawyer on the other side
of the Metadesk case

knows that I didn't
go to law school.

17:47.565 --> 17:48.497

17:48.533 --> 17:49.693
I saw her come

I threatened that suit

is because she didn't like not
getting her way with me,

what would have happened

28:11.973 --> 28:13.439

that you lied,

was that everything

been doing this very long.
