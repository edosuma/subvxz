WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.680
Why did we join this place?

00:07.040 --> 00:09.318
This is so rank.
What is that guy doing?

00:09.319 --> 00:12.040
He's exfoliating.
He's grating his foot onto the floor

00:12.041 --> 00:13.919
like a block of cheese

00:13.920 --> 00:16.039
Oh, well, that's grim.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.039
Shall I take it out, then?

00:18.040 --> 00:19.720
No, leave it in. Cork it.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.839
Lovely.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.479
Gonna swallow it?

00:24.480 --> 00:27.000
Swallow it maybe.
Are you gonna swallow it?

00:27.001 --> 00:29.799
No! Spit it on the floor.
Much better.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.558
You don't like people, do you?
I just don't like their bodies.

00:33.559 --> 00:36.238
That's kind of how they come.
Standard packaging, innit?

00:36.239 --> 00:38.280
There's a limit to how much
my senses can take.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.839
And that's my limit.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.760
I think I'll hit the plunge pool
before someone has a shit in my lap.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.719
Excuse me, mate, are you dry?
Oh, er...

01:09.720 --> 01:12.358
Are you dry, mate,
or are you still a bit wet?

01:12.359 --> 01:15.720
No, I'm pretty dry.
Can I borrow your towel, please?

01:15.721 --> 01:17.959
Oh, right. Do you not have a...?

01:17.960 --> 01:21.440
I've been a numpty. I left mine at
home. I'll be as quick as a flash.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.599
Yeah.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.478
Cheers, mate. You're a legend.

01:28.479 --> 01:31.760
It's just that I'm supposed to be
meeting this bird. No, it's fine.

01:31.761 --> 01:34.079
I'm fine with this.
Ta.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.880
I'll be two ticks.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.198
He didn't just pat himself down.

01:47.199 --> 01:50.198
He got right in the cracks.
He was practically flossing with it.

01:50.199 --> 01:52.478
That's gross.
I had to throw it away.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.720
Why did you lend it to him?
He put me on the spot.

01:54.721 --> 01:56.439
He was naked.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.438
What kind of sicko borrows a towel?

01:58.439 --> 02:01.280
What else was he supposed to do?
He could have dripped dry.

02:01.281 --> 02:04.599
Drip dry?
I often drip dry. Or shake dry.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.159
Shake dry? Do you mean like a dog?

02:07.160 --> 02:10.358
It works, doesn't it?
You never see a dog with a towel.

02:10.359 --> 02:12.760
Oh, by Jove, it's him.
It's the towel guy.

02:12.761 --> 02:14.479
Where?
With the flowers.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.999
Who? Cassius?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.918
You know the towel guy?
Yeah.

02:17.919 --> 02:20.158
Cynthia's started seeing him.
Seeing him?

02:20.159 --> 02:23.080
Out and about or,
like, seeing him during sex?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.719
What do you reckon?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.199
Everyone, this is Cassius.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.160
Cassius, these are my neighbours.

02:31.161 --> 02:33.879
Stylax, Grumio and Marcus.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.280
It's you! I hardly recognised you
with clothes on.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.199
Yeah, likewise.
You two know each other.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.800
This hero lent me his towel.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.838
I would have stood you up if it
weren't for him, so thanks again.

02:44.839 --> 02:47.158
Nice tatt, dude.
Thank you very much.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.280
The mark of a gladiator.
You're a gladiator?

02:49.281 --> 02:50.839
Oh, God.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.358
Middleweight net man,
East End Division,
just transferred from Syracuse.

02:54.359 --> 02:56.080
You know your stuff, don't you?

02:56.081 --> 02:58.039
I collect the stickers.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.158
I can sort you out with tickets
for tomorrow.

03:00.159 --> 03:02.960
Why don't you come and cheer me on?
Wicked. Nice one.

03:02.961 --> 03:04.360
OK, yeah.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.278
I can't compete with that.
Well, not fighting, no.

03:09.279 --> 03:11.198
You've got other skills.
Such as?

03:11.199 --> 03:13.558
Spelling. You were top
of the class at school.

03:13.559 --> 03:16.958
Shall I suggest a spell-off, then?
You'd spell him a new arsehole.

03:16.959 --> 03:20.838
Also there's something else
I didn't mention before. What?

03:20.839 --> 03:24.798
When I saw him naked in the changing
room this morning, he was erm...

03:24.799 --> 03:28.160
Muscular? Yeah, there was one muscle
in particular that stood out.

03:28.161 --> 03:30.359
Are we talking long and slender?

03:30.360 --> 03:33.678
Sort of thick and fearsome
like a boa constrictor.

03:33.679 --> 03:37.398
A thick dick. Whereas mine,
I'd just come out the plunge pool.

03:37.399 --> 03:39.758
Not so snaky?
It was more like a dormouse.

03:39.759 --> 03:42.078
His penis could have eaten my penis
for breakfast.

03:42.079 --> 03:44.078
Just dislocated its jaw
and chowed down.

03:44.079 --> 03:46.320
God knows what damage
he's doing to Cynthia.

03:46.321 --> 03:48.719
What if he tells her about my one?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.558
I'd just come out
of the plunge pool.

03:50.559 --> 03:53.158
He's not going to be talking
to Cynthia about your penis.

03:53.159 --> 03:54.918
Why not? I'm telling you about his.

03:54.919 --> 03:57.998
The guy is a gladiator.
He fights in the arena.

03:57.999 --> 04:01.118
Why would he go home after that and
talk to Cynthia about your penis?

04:01.119 --> 04:04.200
Anyway, I've seen your penis,
Marcus, and it's fine.

04:04.201 --> 04:06.119
Really?
Absolutely fine.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.919
Thanks.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.078
When have you seen my penis?
Ahem.

04:10.079 --> 04:12.078
Can we give it a rest?
Give what a rest?

04:12.079 --> 04:14.398
All that penis talk.
It's very unprofessional.

04:14.399 --> 04:18.640
Are we distracting you? Maybe focus
on doing some work for a change...

04:18.641 --> 04:20.079
mouse cock.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.278
Whoa!
I call it a mouse cock, not you.

04:22.279 --> 04:25.878
And to be clear his cock is the size
of a mouse, not a mouse's cock.

04:25.879 --> 04:28.078
That's right, isn't it?
Without the tail.

04:28.079 --> 04:30.480
I don't care. I don't want to
discuss it any more.

04:30.481 --> 04:31.799
Oh, shit.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.640
I've written "haughtily mouse cock"
on the company's report.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.000
Right, you see? Focus.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.319
I'm so psyched for this.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.598
Are you?
I've always been into gladiating.

04:43.599 --> 04:46.480
It's not called gladiating.
I meant gladiatoring.

04:46.481 --> 04:47.759
Tickets!

04:47.760 --> 04:51.559
Buying and selling tickets!
All right, landlord?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.759
Salve, Grumio, lads.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.678
Taking a break from landlording?
It's not called landlording.

04:56.679 --> 04:59.238
I'm just helping a mate out
who runs the fights.

04:59.239 --> 05:01.038
We're here to see a mate,
as it happens.

05:01.039 --> 05:04.158
An acquaintance, to be fair.
Cassius the net man.

05:04.159 --> 05:08.040
He's up against Orgetorix the Gaul.
Oh. He any good? This Orgetorix?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.599
Nah, he's jiz. One for the crowd.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.558
They love to see a Gaul
get slaughtered.

05:12.559 --> 05:15.680
Good. That is a relief.
Anyway, enjoy the bloodshed.

05:15.681 --> 05:19.080
Tickets! Buying and selling.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.280
Ooh!

06:03.760 --> 06:06.240
Ooh... Ahh!
Ahh!

06:07.480 --> 06:09.199
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

06:09.200 --> 06:10.560
Yeah, sport!

06:14.560 --> 06:17.080
Here he comes.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.600
Where's his helmet?
Net men don't wear helmets.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.479
No, yeah, I know that.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.680
So, did Cassius tell you
about when we met?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.120
Yeah, in the baths. Small world.
Yeah, exactly.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.078
I'd been in the plunge pool.

06:36.079 --> 06:38.120
OK.
Just to give you the context.

06:38.121 --> 06:42.359
I was extremely cold and my body
had gone into survival mode.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.440
So you get the whole picture.
Right.

06:44.441 --> 06:48.840
We, who are about to die,
salute you.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.800
I love that bit.
Here we go.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.799
Go on, Cassius!
Not now.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.080
You'll distract him.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
That's it, my son.
Keep your distance.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.479
No, don't get drawn.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.799
Wait for it.
Wait for it, my son.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.040
No, not there! Not there!
Clearly not there.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.599
That's it. Wear him out.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.200
Nice.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.599
Ha ha ha!

07:19.600 --> 07:22.120
Net him. Fucking net him.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.080
Got the bastard! Ha ha!

07:26.600 --> 07:28.800
Job done.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.960
May I?
Go ahead.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.960
Oh, that is so adorable.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.960
How do you do this, then?

07:56.961 --> 07:59.679
What you wanna do is whip it over,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.438
and then you wanna reel it in.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.718
That's how I pulled Cynth. Really?
Did you put a net on her head?

08:04.719 --> 08:07.520
I wouldn't let her go till she
agreed on a date. Isn't it right?

08:07.521 --> 08:09.399
It was very romantic.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.518
It's the same move I used in the
fight today. Not so romantic.

08:12.519 --> 08:15.158
Your bossed it out there, man.
You were magic.

08:15.159 --> 08:18.160
It was too easy. They keep putting
me up against these Gallic mugs.

08:18.161 --> 08:20.039
Gallic mugs.
Gallic mugs.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.599
His name was Orgetorix.
Was it?

08:22.600 --> 08:26.799
Oh, if you say so.
O-R-G-E-T-R-I-X. Orgetorix.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.360
He's awesome at spelling.
I can see. That is very impressive.

08:30.361 --> 08:32.599
Thank you.
Well done, mate.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.159
Fucking hell!

08:35.159 --> 08:37.558
Yeah, very good. Very good.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.438
Your face!
You were really afraid!

08:40.440 --> 08:43.039
I was afraid I'd hurt Cassius.
You'd pulled his hand off?

08:43.041 --> 08:44.399
Yes.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.319
I'm sorry, geeze. I'm sorry.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
Cheap joke. Cheap joke.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.799
That's a nice grip, man.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.758
Have you done this before?
I've dabbled.

08:53.759 --> 08:55.518
I fancy a hot drink. How about you?

08:55.519 --> 08:58.960
That'd be lovely.
Oh, have you got anything herbal?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.319
Salve, Marcus.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.598
Enjoy the gladiators?
Not really.

09:06.599 --> 09:10.798
Just out of interest, what's their
average lifespan? I don't know.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.998
One or two years?
That long? At least.

09:12.999 --> 09:17.360
One fighter in his 70s
has a sword in one hand,
walking stick in the other. Right.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.798
This mate of yours
who runs the bouts -

09:20.799 --> 09:22.560
Darius.
I don't want to know his name.

09:22.561 --> 09:25.839
Too late, it's Darius.
Could he, in theory,

09:25.840 --> 09:29.719
put Cassius against
someone properly dangerous?

09:29.720 --> 09:31.199
Depends.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.399
What's your budget?
Budget?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.518
To knobble him,
you must have a budget.

09:35.519 --> 09:38.320
I didn't say I wanted to knobble
anybody. A gladiator is easy.

09:38.321 --> 09:40.200
Untraceable, isn't it?

09:45.320 --> 09:47.039
Five dinarii.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.918
For five denarii, you could put him
up against a dog.

09:49.919 --> 09:52.958
And for eight? I think there's an
old hippo knocking about.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.760
How much for an actual person?
At least 20.

09:55.761 --> 10:00.679
I can't go higher than 22...3...
24...25.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.399
I'll see what I can do.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.680
Great. See what you can do.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.880
Now, hot drinks.

10:18.141 --> 10:21.860
It's gone. Relax.
Yes, but where has it gone?

10:21.861 --> 10:23.781
There it is.
Spider.

10:26.221 --> 10:28.099
Got it.
What the hell did you do that for?

10:28.198 --> 10:31.517
Sorry. What did you want me to do?
Not kill it, you bloody psychopath.

10:31.518 --> 10:33.557
It was only a spider.
A living creature.

10:33.558 --> 10:35.437
You don't care for the sanctity
of life.

10:35.438 --> 10:38.997
The sanctity... What? You're the one
going out with a gladiator?

10:38.998 --> 10:42.197
Yeah, so? Killing's kind of what
he does for a living.

10:42.198 --> 10:45.157
Except, he's less spiders,
more people from France.

10:45.158 --> 10:47.837
It's completely different.
He doesn't stamp on them?

10:47.838 --> 10:49.999
Because he doesn't actually
kill anyone.

10:50.959 --> 10:53.998
Sorry, what?
It's theatre.

10:53.999 --> 10:56.478
Well, it's in the theatre.

10:56.479 --> 10:59.517
It's not the kind of acting
that I want to do.

10:59.518 --> 11:03.719
Fight scenes that realistic
are a very skilled theatrical form.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.318
Do you want to tell her or should I?

11:06.319 --> 11:09.079
It's real, Cynth. That's his job.

11:10.679 --> 11:12.919
Piss off.

11:15.199 --> 11:18.238
Are you serious?
Afraid so.

11:18.239 --> 11:20.319
That guy he killed yesterday
wasn't an actor?

11:20.320 --> 11:23.958
Or if he was it was
his last performance. He's dead.

11:23.959 --> 11:27.437
Your boyfriend shoved a trident
into his body and his guts fell out.

11:27.438 --> 11:31.319
That's why he didn't come for
a drink after the show. Not a show.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.358
Why didn't you say anything?

11:33.359 --> 11:36.199
I suppose because we'd already seen
him kill four people,

11:36.200 --> 11:39.078
I assumed that you were aware
that he...

11:39.079 --> 11:41.559
kills people.

11:43.479 --> 11:45.719
What about blood?
She thought it was fake.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.038
Scars?
Also fake.

11:48.039 --> 11:50.237
Maybe she thought his penis
was fake, too.

11:50.238 --> 11:53.637
I hope so. That is the only
explanation for its bloody girth.

11:53.638 --> 11:56.997
And we're back on penises.
Sorry, we should focus.

11:56.998 --> 11:58.837
Well, it might be an idea,
mightn't it?

11:58.838 --> 12:00.957
Focussing on work,
rather than penises.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.199
Do you know what
would help me focus?

12:03.200 --> 12:05.678
A nice cool glass of water.

12:05.679 --> 12:07.678
Yes, it would, actually.

12:07.679 --> 12:10.919
Scientists say that it increases
your productivity by 20%. Really?

12:10.920 --> 12:13.918
I did not know that, Aurelius.
Thank you.

12:13.919 --> 12:16.878
This is so much more civilised.
Holy shit!

12:16.879 --> 12:18.678
Is that a fucking hand?

12:18.679 --> 12:22.718
Flavia!
There's a filthy hand in the jug.

12:22.719 --> 12:26.037
It was an innocent prank.
I just wanted to noodle him a bit.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.639
He's a gibbering wreck. I had
to send him home for the day.

12:29.919 --> 12:32.078
Whose hand is it?
A dead man.

12:32.079 --> 12:33.919
He won't be asking for it back,
then?

12:35.199 --> 12:36.998
Did you know him?

12:36.999 --> 12:40.439
Not personally. I'm sure he wouldn't
have minded. He was very outgoing.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.358
And French.
Right.

12:42.359 --> 12:44.397
Here's what you do.
First, buy a new jug.

12:44.398 --> 12:46.997
Not a problem. Then you will
apologise to water boy.

12:46.998 --> 12:49.559
That's pushing it.
Do it. Now, get out.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.199
Where's the hand now?
I'm taking it home.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.918
What for?
I just want to keep it.

12:55.919 --> 12:58.118
Oh, that is disgusting.

12:58.119 --> 13:01.398
No. God, no,
that's not what I meant.

13:01.399 --> 13:04.919
Why would you even...? Although
I suppose if you shut your eyes...

13:04.920 --> 13:07.039
Throw it away!
Throw it away.

13:09.519 --> 13:13.359
Go on. I've got to get him a jug.
So, buy him one. That's ours.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.718
We never use it.
I do, actually.

13:15.719 --> 13:18.079
If I need a wee at night,
then, it's well handy.

13:19.119 --> 13:21.319
OK, yeah, take it.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.239
Can you hear that?

13:25.679 --> 13:27.799
Cynthia?

13:29.479 --> 13:30.838
Cynthia.

13:30.839 --> 13:32.439
Cass!

13:33.279 --> 13:35.678
What's up, man?
She's dumped me.

13:35.679 --> 13:38.359
Cynthia dumped me.

13:40.359 --> 13:42.359
I've never been dumped before.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.318
She said I was a savage.

13:44.319 --> 13:48.117
That's horrible. I mean, you can see
where she's coming from.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.517
Fine. You know,
what I do is a bit savage, but...

13:50.518 --> 13:52.317
I'm not a savage.
No, you're not.

13:52.318 --> 13:54.797
You're a highly trained,
professional killer.

13:54.798 --> 13:57.277
It's not like you enjoy it.
No, I do a bit.

13:57.278 --> 14:00.119
I don't know. There must be hordes
of women out there

14:00.120 --> 14:02.358
desperate to jump a gladiator.

14:02.359 --> 14:04.397
Get out there
and shag yourself happy.

14:04.398 --> 14:06.917
I'll come with you
and mop up your cast-offs.

14:06.918 --> 14:09.757
Thanks, but I don't think I could
sleep with anyone else.

14:09.758 --> 14:11.837
More for me, then.
What would I do?

14:11.838 --> 14:14.437
Well, you could wait.
Or watch, I suppose.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.759
You think it'd cheer me up
to watch you shagging?

14:16.760 --> 14:18.439
Well... worth a try.

14:19.719 --> 14:22.757
Put her out your mind and focus
on your next fight. When is it?

14:22.758 --> 14:25.239
This weekend.
And who is it against?

14:25.240 --> 14:29.758
I don't know. Don't care. How about
I get you a nice hot drink?

14:29.759 --> 14:32.679
A herbal tea would be lovely.
I'm gonna do that right now.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.478
Thanks, Marcus.
You're a real good mate.

14:35.479 --> 14:38.399
Well... yeah.

14:48.239 --> 14:50.117
I don't need
to knobble him any more.

14:50.118 --> 14:52.519
Cancel the nobbling.
Too late. He's nobbled.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.678
What? How?
I sorted it.

14:54.679 --> 14:56.357
You said you'd see what you could do.

14:56.358 --> 14:58.997
Yeah. I saw what I could do,
and then I did it.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.997
Doing it is not part of
"seeing what I can do".

15:00.998 --> 15:03.917
Sure, it is. I'll see what I can do.
Leave it with me.

15:03.918 --> 15:07.079
"Leave it with me," you can do it.
"See what I can do," you report back.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.158
Well, I did it.
So, undo it.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.359
I can't.
I'm already selling tickets.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.118
Ugh! Who's he fighting?

15:13.119 --> 15:15.078
The Beast of Germania.

15:15.079 --> 15:18.479
Is that a man or an actual beast?
I'd say he was of mixed heritage.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.238
So, what are Cassius's chances?
Very slim.

15:22.239 --> 15:24.919
I reckon The Beast is gonna chew him
up and shit him out.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.038
Not literally.
Has been known. Oh, God.

15:28.039 --> 15:29.957
Can I just ask,
what did this Cassius do

15:29.958 --> 15:31.879
to piss you off in the first place?

15:33.279 --> 15:35.158
He borrowed my towel.

15:35.159 --> 15:37.679
Oh, heavy.

15:39.879 --> 15:43.517
This Beast guy won't definitely win.
First he'll have to kill Cassius,

15:43.518 --> 15:45.239
and then his enormous penis.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.718
Hi, Aurelius.
Good morning.

15:48.719 --> 15:51.117
Sorry for putting that thing
in your jug yesterday.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.719
That thing? That thing
was the hand of a dead man.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.478
Of a fucking dead man.

15:55.479 --> 15:59.199
I apologise. It was meant in the
spirit of fun. It wasn't funny.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.198
But on the other hand...

16:01.199 --> 16:03.239
There is no other hand.

16:04.319 --> 16:07.559
I see you've bought me a new jug.
It's a bit gaudy, but it will do.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.478
Can I give you a hand with it?
I'm fine.

16:10.479 --> 16:12.879
Thank you.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.557
I'd like to lodge
a formal complaint.

16:22.558 --> 16:25.517
Don't you think this has got a bit
out of hand? He's still doing it.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.837
Stop it, shredder.
That one was by accident.

16:27.838 --> 16:31.117
Of course it wasn't.
It was off the cuff. Another one!

16:31.118 --> 16:33.237
I said cuff.
That's not the same as hand.

16:33.238 --> 16:35.317
It's the same ballpark.
OK, OK.

16:35.318 --> 16:37.357
Can we all just calm down, please?

16:37.358 --> 16:40.759
Not until I lodge a formal
complaint. How do I do that?

16:40.760 --> 16:44.158
You... sit up straight

16:44.159 --> 16:46.798
and you say it in a formal manner.

16:46.799 --> 16:49.198
What, really? OK.

16:49.199 --> 16:51.878
Ahem. Since they've arrived,

16:51.879 --> 16:55.197
they've basically turned the copy
room into a boys' club.

16:55.198 --> 16:58.477
They re obsessed with their penises.
We're not obsessed. Yes, you are.

16:58.478 --> 17:00.877
They create a puerile
and unfocussed atmosphere

17:00.878 --> 17:02.639
and it hacks me right off.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.917
Is that it? Thank you.

17:04.919 --> 17:07.679
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, water boy.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.637
May I have a word alone
with shredder?

17:10.638 --> 17:12.478
Thank you for your time.

17:12.479 --> 17:15.398
Water man.
Water man.

17:16.439 --> 17:18.598
Fire him.
Shut up.

17:18.598 --> 17:21.517
You make this nuisance go away
or I will fire your both.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.679
How? Buy him a brooch,
take him out dancing,

17:23.680 --> 17:25.438
cook him a fucking flan.

17:25.439 --> 17:27.759
I don't care! Just deal with it.

17:32.959 --> 17:36.439
This is actually my first time here.
Have you been much?

17:36.440 --> 17:40.078
Oh, yeah, loads. Love it.
I'm an old hand.

17:40.079 --> 17:42.078
Sorry, it was just a joke.

17:42.079 --> 17:44.879
That was fine.
It was funny. It's funny now.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.519
Ooh!

17:50.639 --> 17:53.159
Ahh!

17:54.159 --> 17:56.078
Huh huh!
Ooh!

17:56.079 --> 17:59.319
What the fuck was that one? That's
for The Beast. He has his own chant.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.439
Oh, the men are coming

18:05.119 --> 18:07.158
Shit.

18:07.159 --> 18:09.157
Is your mate The Beast or - ?
The other one.

18:09.158 --> 18:11.799
Where's his helmet?
Net men don't wear helmets.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.638
Do they have nets.

18:13.639 --> 18:15.839
Probably should do.
Grumio, where's his net?

18:15.840 --> 18:16.958
Bugger.

18:16.959 --> 18:19.117
He's forgot it.
He needs to get focussed.

18:19.118 --> 18:22.199
Yes, well, focus is critical.
It's what I've been saying.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.599
We, who are about to die,
salute you.

18:29.639 --> 18:31.878
What's he doing?

18:31.879 --> 18:34.958
He appears to be sitting down.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.799
Stand up! Fight!

18:37.799 --> 18:39.438
Is he crying?

18:39.439 --> 18:41.398
Come on, you, be a man.

18:41.399 --> 18:43.959
Come on, Cass.
What's wrong with him?

18:43.960 --> 18:46.799
He's lovesick.
Oh, that's bad timing.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.958
Cassius.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.278
Cassius.

18:51.279 --> 18:53.158
Cassius.

18:53.159 --> 18:54.838
Cassius.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.398
Cassius.

18:56.399 --> 18:59.318
Cassius! Cassius!

18:59.319 --> 19:00.758
Cassius!

19:00.759 --> 19:02.198
Cassius!

19:02.199 --> 19:05.318
Cassius! Cassius!

19:05.319 --> 19:07.479
Come on, my son,
get your game face on.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.999
Cassius!

19:12.279 --> 19:14.038
Yes, Cassius!

19:14.039 --> 19:16.959
That's it. Back in the game, my son.

19:24.439 --> 19:26.439
Go on, Cassius.

19:29.799 --> 19:32.239
Have him, Cassius!

19:46.559 --> 19:48.558
Hey.
Hey.

19:48.559 --> 19:51.959
What have you got there?
Just some stuff he left at my place.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.998
You should have it.
He liked you guys.

19:54.999 --> 19:56.478
Cool.

19:56.479 --> 19:58.198
Thanks.

19:58.199 --> 20:00.678
So, who was it who killed him?

20:00.679 --> 20:02.997
A guy called The Beast of Germania.
A monster.

20:02.998 --> 20:05.879
He had no chance. Especially cos
some twat shouted out.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.358
I was trying to encourage him.
What did you shout?

20:09.359 --> 20:11.797
Get him, Cassius.
Have him, Cassius.

20:11.798 --> 20:13.519
It doesn't matter now, does it?

20:15.679 --> 20:17.438
Well, Marcus...

20:17.439 --> 20:19.757
If we're playing the blame game.
Which we are not.

20:19.758 --> 20:22.357
Oh, what did you do, Marcus?
Oh, not much.

20:22.358 --> 20:24.439
He fixed it for him to fight that
giant fucker.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.959
What?

20:27.319 --> 20:30.879
How would you even - ?
Landlord... had him nobbled.

20:32.039 --> 20:35.197
He said he wanted a challenge.
Death is quite a challenge.

20:35.198 --> 20:38.119
I wasn't the one who dumped him
and left him with a broken heart.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.478
Oh, so it was my fault.

20:41.479 --> 20:43.757
You paid to have him nobbled,
but it's my fault?

20:43.758 --> 20:46.039
He was a wreck.
He forgot his bloody net.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.078
I thought he'd get over it.
Maybe he will.

20:49.079 --> 20:52.359
Given that it's all an elaborate
stunt. He probably had a trap door.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.959
Or a trap head.

20:57.279 --> 20:59.957
He did actually have quite a good
innings for a gladiator.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.679
Bound to happen sooner or later.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.959
There we go. So, how about we agree
we all killed him and just move on?

21:08.039 --> 21:09.850
Now, who wants a hot drink?
