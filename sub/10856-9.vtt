WEBVTT

00:09.020 --> 00:11.553
I know what's going on.

00:11.557 --> 00:13.223
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

00:13.225 --> 00:15.225
You just drive.

00:15.227 --> 00:17.260
If I was you, I'd drive to Quincy

00:17.262 --> 00:19.229
pick roads where I could go pretty fast

00:19.231 --> 00:21.131
without making anyone look suspicious.

00:29.807 --> 00:33.476
Jesus!

00:37.783 --> 00:39.816
Seth, wake up!

00:39.818 --> 00:41.184
What is that smell?

00:41.186 --> 00:42.385
Come on, get up!

00:42.387 --> 00:43.820
- What's that smell?
- Come on!

00:43.822 --> 00:46.122
We got to get out of here!
Come on! Come on. Here.

00:54.199 --> 00:55.298
Dad! No!

00:55.300 --> 00:56.800
- We got to help Dad!
- Come on! No!

00:56.802 --> 00:58.468
Dad!

00:59.603 --> 01:01.538
No, we have to help him!

01:01.540 --> 01:03.273
Dad!

01:03.275 --> 01:05.175
Dad!

01:05.177 --> 01:06.276
No! No!

01:11.082 --> 01:12.215
The Gecko brothers are back.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.385
That's how I like it. Set me free.

01:15.853 --> 01:17.120
What is wrong with you?

01:17.122 --> 01:18.421
She's not who you are.

01:18.423 --> 01:20.190
You know, my entire life,

01:20.192 --> 01:21.524
I have felt like I've owed you something

01:21.526 --> 01:23.193
because you pulled me out of that fire.

01:23.195 --> 01:25.562
You and me... We're done.

01:27.132 --> 01:29.432
It hurts, I know.

01:29.434 --> 01:32.869
I know.

01:32.871 --> 01:35.138
It's all just part of your awakening.

01:39.643 --> 01:42.112
I need those.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.181
Part of you must die, Richard.

01:45.183 --> 01:47.584
Let it go.

01:53.524 --> 01:56.259
What is it, baby?

01:59.330 --> 02:03.133
Don't you want me to set you free?

02:09.207 --> 02:10.205
I didn't want to hurt you.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.208
Oh, please.

02:12.210 --> 02:14.177
You so wanted this.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.213
You wanted it bad.

02:17.215 --> 02:20.583
How about a little role playing, huh?

02:20.585 --> 02:22.218
Would you like that?

02:23.587 --> 02:25.288
It'll be fun.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.891
I'll be you.

02:27.893 --> 02:30.894
And you be me.

03:11.069 --> 03:13.836
Yummers.

03:28.719 --> 03:31.020
You're getting the hang of it.

03:31.022 --> 03:33.089
The worst is over.

03:49.673 --> 03:51.874
Holy shit.

03:51.876 --> 03:53.943
I'm 20/20.

03:57.014 --> 03:59.849
And it's only the beginning.

04:03.020 --> 04:04.153
It's another dead end!

04:04.155 --> 04:05.821
- What?
- Oh, the beginning.

04:05.823 --> 04:07.056
We went in a big circle?

04:07.058 --> 04:08.791
No, no, no, no, no. The inscription...

04:08.793 --> 04:11.394
It's the beginning of the ancient words.

04:11.396 --> 04:13.763
It's a reference

04:13.765 --> 04:15.998
to the creation myth in the Popol Vuh.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.401
Rebirth.

04:18.403 --> 04:20.136
Renewal.

04:20.137 --> 04:22.137
Rebirth.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.406
Renewal.

04:23.408 --> 04:24.840
- Rebirth.
- What are you doing?

04:24.842 --> 04:26.809
Don't touch things, in here. Please.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.950
- Aah!
- What did you do?

04:34.952 --> 04:36.852
Oh, my...

04:36.854 --> 04:38.821
What the hell did you do?!

04:45.863 --> 04:46.962
Okay.

04:46.964 --> 04:48.030
Hey.

04:48.032 --> 04:50.700
Do you see this?

04:58.443 --> 04:59.875
There's stairs.

04:59.877 --> 05:01.177
They go up.

05:01.179 --> 05:04.146
Up is good, right?

05:04.148 --> 05:05.448
Better than down.

05:05.450 --> 05:07.717
Yeah, fucking "A."

05:13.757 --> 05:16.125
Oh, finally.

05:17.461 --> 05:20.196
Wait. Richie?

05:20.198 --> 05:21.964
He's still alive.

05:21.966 --> 05:24.767
He looks pretty good for a
guy that just got shot.

05:27.471 --> 05:29.505
Oh, son of a bitch.

05:35.947 --> 05:37.179
What are you waiting for, huh?

05:37.181 --> 05:38.948
We're free. Let's get out of here.

05:38.950 --> 05:40.082
We can't leave without Scott.

05:40.084 --> 05:43.886
I can stay back. I'll help out.

05:46.823 --> 05:48.758
Get your hands off me, Padre.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.092
I'm going to get my brother.

05:50.094 --> 05:51.761
You sure he's still your brother?

05:58.802 --> 05:59.835
Good luck.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.177
Where is she?

06:08.179 --> 06:09.845
Okay, Richie, look.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.046
I know it's not your fault.

06:11.048 --> 06:12.281
She played you, okay?

06:12.283 --> 06:15.384
Just tell me where she is.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.033
Sorry, brother.

06:31.035 --> 06:32.802
Things are about to get a little weird.

06:39.342 --> 06:41.577
You never told me.

06:41.579 --> 06:43.112
What's that?

06:43.114 --> 06:44.980
About Mom.

06:44.982 --> 06:47.983
Well, maybe when we find
Scott and we get out of here.

06:47.985 --> 06:49.151
I know what she did...

06:49.153 --> 06:51.854
The night of the accident.

06:51.856 --> 06:54.290
I know about the pills.

06:54.292 --> 06:56.325
How?

06:56.327 --> 06:58.060
This place.

06:58.062 --> 06:59.295
It showed me.

06:59.297 --> 07:03.032
That's why you were driving so fast.

07:03.034 --> 07:05.134
You were trying to get her to the hospital

07:05.136 --> 07:06.936
so they could pump her stomach.

07:06.938 --> 07:08.571
I didn't want you and Scott to know.

07:08.573 --> 07:10.072
I didn't want you to ever know.

07:10.074 --> 07:12.041
No, of course you didn't.

07:12.043 --> 07:13.943
God, you carried this all on your own.

07:13.945 --> 07:16.111
You don't have to anymore.

07:16.113 --> 07:18.914
We're gonna go find Scott

07:18.916 --> 07:21.417
and then we're gonna make
it out of here a family.

07:22.586 --> 07:24.186
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.188
I heard something.

07:29.193 --> 07:31.327
Oh, Ranger Gonzalez.

07:32.195 --> 07:33.896
I'm glad to see you're still alive.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.998
Where's Seth?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.199
He found a way out.

07:37.201 --> 07:39.001
He went through a door with his brother.

07:39.003 --> 07:41.003
- Richie's alive?
- Yes, sir.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.873
Come on. Let's get out of here.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.174
What are you all still doing here, anyway?

07:48.345 --> 07:50.012
Your son.

07:50.014 --> 07:51.413
Have you seen him?

07:53.350 --> 07:55.951
Ranger Gonzalez.

07:57.988 --> 08:00.189
They got him.

08:00.191 --> 08:02.291
You saw it happen?

08:02.293 --> 08:03.359
You saw him bitten?

08:03.361 --> 08:04.994
He tried to bite me.

08:14.938 --> 08:17.339
I'm gonna see for myself.

08:17.341 --> 08:20.042
You stay down here, you'll
get lost forever or worse.

08:20.044 --> 08:21.277
I'm telling you what I saw.

08:21.279 --> 08:23.145
He's gone.

08:23.147 --> 08:27.082
Thank you for your
concern, Ranger Gonzalez.

08:27.084 --> 08:30.452
But we're gonna go find my brother.

08:30.454 --> 08:33.121
You do what you need to do.

08:55.111 --> 08:56.946
Damn it.

08:56.948 --> 08:59.048
What the hell is going on?

08:59.050 --> 09:00.416
I'm trying to get us to El Rey.

09:00.418 --> 09:02.685
Richard, you just bashed
yourself in your own head.

09:02.687 --> 09:05.287
That other me is kind of a dick... Okay?...

09:05.289 --> 09:07.189
And he's not exactly real.

09:07.191 --> 09:08.991
No?

09:08.993 --> 09:11.293
Then how the hell do I know you are, huh?

09:11.295 --> 09:13.429
Maybe in death, I can
finally give you the peace

09:13.431 --> 09:15.264
that I can't seem to give you in life.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.366
Seth, just let me explain. Please.

09:17.368 --> 09:19.501
Just please listen to
me and let me explain.

09:22.439 --> 09:25.374
This is a trick. No, this
whole thing is a trick.

09:26.443 --> 09:28.010
You can say goodbye to the money, Richard,

09:28.012 --> 09:29.311
because I am out.

09:39.089 --> 09:40.723
You got to be kidding me.

09:40.725 --> 09:45.127
No more tricks, Seth Gecko.

09:45.129 --> 09:48.063
But... There will be games.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.232
Put that down, Seth,

09:50.234 --> 09:53.002
unless you never want to leave this temple.

09:53.004 --> 09:54.436
Temple?

09:54.438 --> 09:56.472
I stepped out the door and
I was in the parking lot.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.741
You stepped through a door, yes.

09:58.743 --> 10:00.376
But you entered the Ahk'abbih.

10:00.378 --> 10:02.277
- The who?
- It's a labyrinth.

10:02.279 --> 10:04.513
It's like a maze. It's just
a little different, although...

10:04.515 --> 10:07.015
Yes, I know what a labyrinth
is, Richard, thank you.

10:07.017 --> 10:08.751
It's like the hedges in "The Shining."

10:08.753 --> 10:11.487
Except I don't see any
goddamn shrubbery around here.

10:11.489 --> 10:13.355
'Cause it's a labyrinth of the mind.

10:13.357 --> 10:16.358
It was placed here by
the lords of the night.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.195
And there's only one path, but it's blocked

10:20.197 --> 10:23.499
by rompecabezas puzzles.

10:23.501 --> 10:25.167
Games.

10:25.169 --> 10:29.138
And the only way to reach
the center is to win.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.539
What's the prize?

10:32.375 --> 10:34.410
Me.

10:34.412 --> 10:35.778
No thanks.

10:35.780 --> 10:37.379
Look, it's not just a temple, Seth.

10:37.381 --> 10:40.182
It... It's a prison.

10:40.184 --> 10:41.316
No, no, no, no.

10:41.318 --> 10:43.185
No, this isn't a prison.

10:43.187 --> 10:45.254
This is an asylum.

10:45.256 --> 10:48.057
What was your sentence, huh?

10:48.059 --> 10:49.792
Five years?

10:49.794 --> 10:51.226
Hmm?

10:52.796 --> 10:56.131
Try five hundred.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.167
Well, what if I say no?

10:58.169 --> 11:01.170
You can't say no.

11:01.172 --> 11:03.505
When you walked through that door,

11:03.507 --> 11:05.541
it closed behind you.

11:07.477 --> 11:08.677
Hey. Hey.

11:11.581 --> 11:13.449
If you want to make it out of here,

11:13.451 --> 11:15.250
it has to be through the labyrinth.

11:42.211 --> 11:43.511
Move.

11:44.847 --> 11:46.581
Seth left before the show started.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.583
Maybe he moved it.

11:48.585 --> 11:50.451
Right.

11:51.854 --> 11:54.388
Awesome. Maybe.

12:22.317 --> 12:23.885
That's it.

12:23.887 --> 12:25.686
That's the bag.

12:33.395 --> 12:35.630
What exactly did she say to Richie?

12:35.632 --> 12:37.398
Look. I told you.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.900
She said you're greedy

12:38.902 --> 12:40.401
and that's why she's
picking him instead of you.

12:40.403 --> 12:42.904
Look. I did my part.

12:42.906 --> 12:44.639
You promised you'd help me find my family.

12:44.641 --> 12:47.575
They are serving their
purpose in the temple, Scott,

12:47.577 --> 12:50.344
as you're serving yours here with me.

12:50.346 --> 12:52.647
- No, no. But you said that you...
- But nothing.

12:52.649 --> 12:54.582
Considering what I've done for you,

12:54.584 --> 12:56.450
I'd say a little gratitude is in order.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.554
You cannot go back to them.

13:02.524 --> 13:05.193
Just accept that you're different, Scott.

13:05.195 --> 13:07.228
Hey.

13:07.230 --> 13:09.263
Scott.

13:09.265 --> 13:12.333
You're better.

13:21.543 --> 13:23.444
Okay, so, let me get this straight.

13:23.446 --> 13:25.947
I get through this labyrinth
and then I get to you.

13:25.949 --> 13:29.483
No, not to me. To my blood.

13:29.485 --> 13:30.453
What?

13:30.478 --> 13:32.478
It's inside something you
would understand to be a vault.

13:32.555 --> 13:33.955
A sarcophagus.

13:33.957 --> 13:36.457
When we get it, she'll be replenished.

13:36.459 --> 13:38.526
And then what? You're cured?

13:38.528 --> 13:41.529
The hunger cannot be cured.

13:41.531 --> 13:42.964
But I will be free.

13:42.966 --> 13:44.966
Oh, really? To do what?

13:44.968 --> 13:47.468
Take your little show on the road?

13:47.470 --> 13:49.303
Murder and mayhem from coast to coast?

13:49.305 --> 13:50.438
That's... That's her big plan?

13:50.440 --> 13:51.739
Seth, we boost the blood,

13:51.741 --> 13:53.374
we deliver the goods, and the job is done.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.542
What job?

13:54.544 --> 13:55.743
Soon you'll know.

13:55.745 --> 13:57.979
In the labyrinth, the
trials are constructed

13:57.981 --> 13:59.614
from the memories of everyone in it.

13:59.616 --> 14:02.483
I don't know.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.285
Labyrinth, trials.

14:04.287 --> 14:06.520
This whole thing seems
like a long way to go

14:06.522 --> 14:08.389
to keep a showgirl in a cage.

14:10.627 --> 14:12.326
It's a test,

14:12.328 --> 14:15.329
put here by the lords of the night.

14:15.331 --> 14:19.567
Whoever has the purity of
mind to withstand the trials

14:19.569 --> 14:20.668
will be deemed worthy.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.270
Of what?

14:22.272 --> 14:23.571
No one knows.

14:23.573 --> 14:27.341
In five centuries...

14:27.343 --> 14:29.744
It's never been done.

14:36.519 --> 14:38.519
All right.

14:38.521 --> 14:40.388
When do we start?

14:41.623 --> 14:43.557
As soon as I leave.

14:43.559 --> 14:44.792
I can't go with you.

14:44.794 --> 14:46.761
The lords would know that I was there

14:46.763 --> 14:48.796
and they don't like cheating.

14:48.798 --> 14:50.831
No self-respecting God does.

15:09.551 --> 15:11.652
Perfect.

15:11.654 --> 15:14.455
Well, good news is,
you know the job.

15:14.457 --> 15:16.791
The bad news is, you got
yourself busted doing it.

15:16.793 --> 15:18.392
Oh, yeah. I wonder why.

15:18.394 --> 15:21.562
We both know why. Just run it for me.

15:21.564 --> 15:24.598
The Parker Hotel...

15:24.600 --> 15:27.068
All the fabricated comforts of home

15:27.070 --> 15:28.836
for the well-traveled business executive,

15:28.838 --> 15:30.838
except this one happens to be a front

15:30.840 --> 15:33.541
for the Houston syndicate's
money laundering operation

15:33.543 --> 15:36.510
run by none other than Big Jim Thompson.

15:36.512 --> 15:38.346
There's a rib joint in the lobby.

15:38.348 --> 15:40.548
That and the hotel are how
he hides significant cash flow

15:40.550 --> 15:42.616
from illegal enterprises all over Houston.

15:42.618 --> 15:44.885
Every night, 7:00 sharp,

15:44.887 --> 15:47.621
Big Jim here likes to have a cold one,

15:47.623 --> 15:48.856
and stuff his gullet full

15:48.858 --> 15:51.726
of Houston's finest slow-roasted pork.

15:51.728 --> 15:54.095
During that 30-minute window,

15:54.097 --> 15:55.563
the first man makes a delivery

15:55.565 --> 15:57.631
up to the counting room on the third floor.

15:57.633 --> 15:58.866
He sets off a diversion

15:58.868 --> 16:01.635
while the other man disables the security.

16:01.637 --> 16:03.437
As soon as that's finished,

16:03.439 --> 16:05.373
the two men converge onto the penthouse

16:05.375 --> 16:07.908
and start cracking the safe.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.845
That's where the real score is.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.117
10 million in uncut diamonds.

16:16.119 --> 16:18.753
Good bet that's where the
labyrinth is keeping the blood.

16:18.755 --> 16:20.521
Shouldn't be too much of a problem

16:20.523 --> 16:21.789
with all our new swag.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.524
No, no, no. No dice.

16:23.526 --> 16:24.859
We can't lug that thing
all the way up there, okay?

16:24.861 --> 16:26.727
You got to go native. Touch and feel.

16:26.729 --> 16:29.864
Hey, same goes for the arsenal, all right?

16:29.866 --> 16:31.599
Keep it simple.

16:31.601 --> 16:33.868
We are at a severe disadvantage
if we don't take these.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.803
Oh, that's right. It's a house of horrors.

16:35.805 --> 16:38.439
And one of my worst
memories, thanks to you.

16:38.441 --> 16:39.740
I told you not to take
that job in the first place.

16:39.742 --> 16:42.209
- Well, that was a good score.
- With a bad mark.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.543
You only went after that guy

16:43.545 --> 16:45.145
'cause Big Jim kicked Dad out of Houston.

16:45.147 --> 16:46.947
You made it personal, and
that's why you blew it.

16:46.949 --> 16:49.483
No, I blew it because I didn't
have the right boxman with me.

16:49.485 --> 16:50.684
Well, now you do.

16:50.686 --> 16:52.586
This place can throw
whatever it wants at us

16:52.588 --> 16:53.654
and it doesn't matter.

16:53.656 --> 16:54.855
You know why?

16:54.857 --> 16:57.725
'Cause the Gecko brothers ride again.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.537
You kept them on you?

17:09.539 --> 17:11.839
The safest place I could think of.

17:18.213 --> 17:19.680
I had to let her do it, Seth.

17:19.682 --> 17:20.815
I was a dead man.

17:20.817 --> 17:22.516
Is being her slave any better?

17:22.518 --> 17:23.684
I'm not her slave.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.653
Oh, then what are you exactly?

17:25.655 --> 17:27.621
I'm your brother.

17:45.808 --> 17:48.509
Okay, this is the drop spot.

17:48.511 --> 17:50.578
My guy's always on time.

17:53.915 --> 17:54.915
There we go.

17:57.919 --> 18:00.020
- So that's how it is.
- What?

18:00.022 --> 18:01.255
The bodyguard.

18:01.257 --> 18:02.957
He wasn't on the original job.

18:02.959 --> 18:04.725
I did time with that guy.

18:04.727 --> 18:07.528
Son of a bitch kicked the
shit out of me in the yard.

18:07.530 --> 18:08.896
Labyrinth of the mind.

18:10.765 --> 18:11.966
Is that Pritchard?

18:11.968 --> 18:13.033
He wasn't there, either.

18:13.035 --> 18:14.702
Yeah, well, he's here now.

18:14.704 --> 18:16.871
Probably because the labyrinth
knows that I hate him.

18:16.873 --> 18:19.006
All right.

18:19.008 --> 18:20.674
Hold on a second.

18:20.676 --> 18:24.011
This isn't a video game. There's no reset.

18:24.013 --> 18:25.813
You die, and you're dead.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.758
- Ah, you clean up nice.
- Eat me.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.359
Seth Gecko?

18:39.361 --> 18:40.460
Nice night for a walk, Warren.

18:40.462 --> 18:41.929
I'm gonna need that cash.

18:41.931 --> 18:44.164
Not so fast, Bluto.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.633
Are you sure you want to do this?

18:45.635 --> 18:47.001
Why don't you go ahead and toss him the bag

18:47.003 --> 18:49.036
- while he thinks about it?
- You heard him. Toss it.

18:49.038 --> 18:51.038
Chop, chop.

18:55.778 --> 18:57.645
What?

19:33.683 --> 19:35.082
No! No!

19:37.119 --> 19:38.018
Richie, just get the money.

19:41.057 --> 19:41.989
Just get the money.

19:59.940 --> 20:02.642
Hey.

20:02.644 --> 20:04.644
I just wanted to say thank you.

20:04.646 --> 20:06.279
For what?

20:06.281 --> 20:07.947
Helping us find my brother.

20:07.949 --> 20:09.382
Yeah.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.419
You don't believe he can be saved, do you?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.187
I know what I saw.

20:15.189 --> 20:19.058
But I've been wrong about
a lot of things I saw today.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.393
What do you mean?

20:20.395 --> 20:22.161
I've been tracking a serial killer

20:22.163 --> 20:24.263
who I thought was Richard Gecko.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.665
Richie?

20:25.667 --> 20:27.667
What did he do?

20:27.669 --> 20:29.535
He killed a woman in that motel.

20:31.672 --> 20:34.106
But I think someone made him do it.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.675
I believe that.

20:35.677 --> 20:38.210
Richie's a tortured soul.

20:38.212 --> 20:39.679
And after all I've seen today,

20:39.681 --> 20:41.480
who knows what kind of
torture he's been through.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.717
What?

20:44.719 --> 20:47.286
You see the good in people.

20:54.062 --> 20:55.461
It's so bad.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.163
What is that smell?

21:01.302 --> 21:03.469
It smells awful.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.280
What was that?

21:16.116 --> 21:18.050
We're not alone in here, guys.

21:18.052 --> 21:19.218
Oh, God.

21:19.220 --> 21:21.320
Stay close.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.122
Dad.

21:24.725 --> 21:26.459
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:29.197 --> 21:30.730
We got to get out of here.

21:30.732 --> 21:32.198
- Go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.466
- Move it.
- There's something back there.

21:33.468 --> 21:35.067
We were just over there. Come on.

21:36.371 --> 21:38.304
Come on. Get up.

21:39.072 --> 21:41.207
No!

21:41.209 --> 21:42.408
Get off me!

21:44.345 --> 21:46.178
- Get off me.
- Get up, get up.

21:48.149 --> 21:49.482
Kate!

21:51.085 --> 21:52.785
No!

21:54.756 --> 21:58.224
Hey! Hey, over here! Get
away from my daughter!

21:58.226 --> 22:00.493
Over here!

22:00.495 --> 22:02.294
Run, Kate!

22:02.296 --> 22:04.764
- I'll get her. You get Jacob, okay?
- Got you.

22:04.766 --> 22:07.433
Run, Kate! Get out of here!

22:25.253 --> 22:27.386
Dad?

22:27.388 --> 22:29.388
Oh, God.

22:32.293 --> 22:35.227
Hello?

22:38.366 --> 22:40.199
Hello?

22:46.406 --> 22:49.241
Dad?

22:50.578 --> 22:53.546
I got you. You're okay.

22:53.548 --> 22:54.547
Where's my dad?

22:54.549 --> 22:55.815
We'll find him.

22:55.817 --> 22:58.317
We got to get out of here, okay?

22:58.319 --> 23:00.553
- Okay.
- Come on.

23:10.130 --> 23:12.832
Guy nearly broke my neck
with his bare hands.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.834
I don't know what the hell this is, man.

23:14.836 --> 23:17.169
This... He was not that strong in prison.

23:17.171 --> 23:18.170
Not at all.

23:18.172 --> 23:20.406
He wasn't a Culebra, right?

23:20.408 --> 23:22.174
No.

23:22.176 --> 23:24.643
No, he definitely was not.

23:27.848 --> 23:30.282
- You missed a spot.
- Yeah, I couldn't help it.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.584
- Yeah?
- Something came over me.

23:31.586 --> 23:33.185
- I had to.
- You had to what?

23:33.187 --> 23:34.520
- Had to, what, feed?
- Yeah.

23:34.522 --> 23:36.722
- You couldn't control yourself.
- No, I couldn't!

23:41.863 --> 23:43.863
What?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.467
Jesus Christ! What the hell?

23:48.469 --> 23:49.869
What?

23:49.871 --> 23:52.872
Your f...

23:52.874 --> 23:55.207
What?

23:55.209 --> 23:58.477
I'm Pritchard?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.279
Shit.

24:00.281 --> 24:02.615
Yeah, all right. All right!

24:09.923 --> 24:11.690
How the hell did you do that?

24:11.692 --> 24:13.292
I don't know.

24:13.294 --> 24:15.895
But I could feel it in my body.

24:15.897 --> 24:19.565
It's like it was tearing me apart.

24:25.305 --> 24:27.239
You saving me for dessert?

24:27.241 --> 24:29.642
We were gonna keep you
around for inside information,

24:29.644 --> 24:31.911
but there's been a change in plans.

24:31.913 --> 24:34.446
You're going to serve a higher purpose.

24:36.651 --> 24:38.717
You've got two choices.

24:38.719 --> 24:41.954
One... You stay here

24:41.956 --> 24:45.291
and watch that designer
suit rot off your bones.

24:45.293 --> 24:50.262
Or... You can help me stop what's coming.

24:51.689 --> 24:55.689
_

24:56.627 --> 24:59.127
_

24:59.152 --> 25:02.152
_

25:03.806 --> 25:06.806
_

25:07.493 --> 25:08.493
_

25:08.608 --> 25:10.608
_

25:11.104 --> 25:12.604
_

25:13.459 --> 25:16.459
_

25:17.607 --> 25:19.607
_

25:20.143 --> 25:23.143
_

25:50.458 --> 25:52.324
Okay, 30 minutes on the clock.

25:52.326 --> 25:53.559
By the time you disable security

25:53.561 --> 25:54.994
and make your way to the penthouse,

25:54.996 --> 25:56.629
I'll gonna make the drop
in the counting room.

25:56.631 --> 25:58.530
Except for one problem.

25:58.532 --> 26:00.399
What?

26:01.601 --> 26:05.738
Do I look like the goddamn
Chamber of Commerce?

26:05.740 --> 26:07.439
Oh, great.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.508
- Another blast from the past.
- Or worse.

26:09.510 --> 26:11.310
The security room is right behind him.

26:14.481 --> 26:16.315
What do we do now?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.588
I got a better idea.

26:22.590 --> 26:24.690
What are you doing?

26:24.692 --> 26:26.492
Whoa, hey!

26:26.494 --> 26:28.427
What the hell do you think you're doing?

26:28.429 --> 26:29.795
Tactics, brother.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.530
Tactics.

26:31.532 --> 26:34.533
What?

26:39.639 --> 26:42.508
I hope you know what you're doing, brother.

26:42.510 --> 26:44.376
Mmm.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.714
I'd like a word with big Jim.

26:51.785 --> 26:53.452
Yeah.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.662
Most people wait to sit
until I tell them to.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.464
Well, I'm not most people.

27:05.466 --> 27:07.666
I'm a boxman.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.569
Best one since Ray Gecko.

27:12.373 --> 27:14.773
Now, there's a name that
I haven't thought about

27:14.775 --> 27:16.342
in a long time.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.410
That's probably because in my business,

27:18.412 --> 27:20.546
I make it a point to forget the losers.

27:21.749 --> 27:23.682
Ah, well, you're gonna remember me.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.818
I've got your next big score.

27:32.425 --> 27:34.626
You ever been to Brazil?

27:35.862 --> 27:37.129
Excellent food.

27:37.131 --> 27:39.131
Even better women.

27:39.133 --> 27:41.400
The fact is, they've got some of the most

27:41.402 --> 27:46.372
beautiful, beautiful women
on the planet down there.

27:46.374 --> 27:50.909
But did you know that some of those women

27:50.911 --> 27:53.412
aren't really women at all?

27:53.414 --> 27:57.416
The fact is, Brazil is home to one

27:57.418 --> 28:00.819
of the largest populations
of transsexuals in the world.

28:02.823 --> 28:07.559
They got... They got so many,
they even got a tour bus...

28:07.561 --> 28:09.628
A special tour bus in Rio.

28:09.630 --> 28:12.431
And it stops at this one
particular street corner.

28:12.433 --> 28:13.899
And there's women all over the place.

28:13.901 --> 28:17.136
And everybody in the
tour bus looks out at them

28:17.138 --> 28:18.537
and then places bets

28:18.539 --> 28:20.439
on which ones are actually women,

28:20.441 --> 28:21.840
which ones are actually men.

28:21.842 --> 28:24.410
And then when all the bets are placed,

28:24.412 --> 28:29.515
these women lift their skirts
and they show us their business.

28:31.519 --> 28:33.852
I hear they got nice beaches, too.

28:33.854 --> 28:38.524
I have never lost a single bet.

28:38.526 --> 28:40.826
You know why? Come here.

28:40.828 --> 28:44.930
That is because I know that just because

28:44.932 --> 28:47.933
you might see two big jugs up here,

28:47.935 --> 28:51.170
that don't mean that
there ain't a pork sword

28:51.172 --> 28:54.473
down below just waiting
to take you for a ride.

28:54.475 --> 28:57.743
Now, you tell me, young man.

28:57.745 --> 29:01.880
Why exactly should I gamble on
what you got under your suit?

29:05.585 --> 29:07.252
Because if I was working
for you tonight,

29:07.254 --> 29:08.387
I would have been smart enough

29:08.389 --> 29:11.790
to check a thief's bag
for a hidden compartment.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.593
And if Lord Humongous had
done his job correctly,

29:14.595 --> 29:17.463
you wouldn't be in danger
of a sex change yourself.

29:27.574 --> 29:29.908
Boy, you got some cojones, don't you?

29:29.910 --> 29:31.610
I like that.

29:31.612 --> 29:32.744
Boss.

29:32.746 --> 29:33.779
What?

29:37.484 --> 29:39.218
No, don't worry about it. It's Pritchard.

29:39.220 --> 29:42.621
He'll make his delivery.

29:45.024 --> 29:46.925
I got some business to attend to.

29:46.927 --> 29:49.895
Meet me upstairs in the
penthouse in five minutes.

29:49.897 --> 29:53.499
We'll talk it out.

30:21.261 --> 30:23.729
Move your ass.

30:23.731 --> 30:24.863
Time's running out.

30:33.239 --> 30:36.340
I forgot to tell you.
I got some girls.

30:41.546 --> 30:42.613
Damn it.

30:47.285 --> 30:48.318
How do I get out of here?

30:48.320 --> 30:49.453
You want your supper?

30:49.455 --> 30:51.388
Then sit down and do what you're told.

30:55.093 --> 30:56.460
You know the drill.

30:56.462 --> 30:58.395
It ain't gonna put itself together.

30:58.397 --> 31:00.364
Oh, so that's the game we're playing, huh?

31:02.201 --> 31:03.133
Shit.

31:09.374 --> 31:10.474
Shit. Come on.

31:14.113 --> 31:15.279
There.

31:15.281 --> 31:17.981
Your Colt 1911 pistol fully assembled.

31:17.983 --> 31:18.982
Now open the door.

31:18.984 --> 31:21.017
Too slow. Do it again.

31:25.223 --> 31:27.224
Big Jim is asking for you.

31:39.637 --> 31:42.839
You have no idea what I
live with day in, day out.

31:42.841 --> 31:45.842
The things I got to do
for you and your brother.

31:45.844 --> 31:47.344
The least you can do is clean my guns.

31:47.346 --> 31:49.646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard it before.

31:49.714 --> 31:51.148
Not fast enough.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.816
Can you do it faster?

31:54.087 --> 31:55.185
I can't hear you.

31:55.186 --> 31:55.853
I can do it faster.

31:55.855 --> 31:57.588
Good. 'Cause if you don't,

31:57.590 --> 31:59.156
I'm gonna take this bottle

31:59.158 --> 32:01.158
and I'm gonna bust it over your melon head.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.860
You think you're such a king shit.

32:02.862 --> 32:05.462
You're nothing but a
wise-ass little prick.

32:05.464 --> 32:06.730
You're a bitch.

32:08.166 --> 32:09.900
You and that retard brother of yours

32:09.902 --> 32:11.602
aren't gonna amount to squat.

32:11.604 --> 32:13.470
Irish twins.

32:13.472 --> 32:15.472
Born a year apart because
your miserable mick mother

32:15.474 --> 32:16.673
wasn't allowed to use birth control.

32:16.675 --> 32:18.342
But, damn,

32:18.344 --> 32:19.676
she couldn't wait to
get you out of her belly.

32:19.678 --> 32:21.211
Yeah, couldn't wait to
get away from you, either.

32:21.213 --> 32:22.880
What did you say to me?

32:22.882 --> 32:24.681
I said...

32:24.683 --> 32:26.483
She couldn't wait to get away

32:26.485 --> 32:29.419
from her drunk, pathetic
excuse for a husband.

32:34.893 --> 32:36.393
You got a mouth on you.

32:36.395 --> 32:39.596
You know whose mouth it is?

32:39.598 --> 32:42.199
Your mother's.

32:43.502 --> 32:45.335
The things she could do with that mouth.

32:47.272 --> 32:48.639
Well, guess what.

32:48.641 --> 32:50.507
She couldn't stand the sight of you.

32:50.509 --> 32:54.311
She got one look at you boys and she ran.

32:54.313 --> 32:56.580
Now do it again.

33:16.334 --> 33:17.434
That's got to be faster.

33:33.452 --> 33:35.452
You really think you can save Richard?

33:35.454 --> 33:37.254
Well, you can't.

33:37.256 --> 33:40.991
Your mother knew what
he was just like I know.

33:40.993 --> 33:42.693
He was a bad seed.

33:42.695 --> 33:44.761
What's that smell?

33:49.568 --> 33:50.767
Lighter fluid.

33:54.272 --> 33:57.441
Same thing you smelled on
your brother that night.

33:57.443 --> 33:59.977
No. Richie saved me from that fire.

33:59.979 --> 34:01.278
Seth, wake up!

34:01.280 --> 34:02.579
Aah!

34:02.581 --> 34:04.381
Right after he set it.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.384
No!

34:07.386 --> 34:09.319
You're a liar.

34:09.321 --> 34:11.755
I was a lot of things, Seth.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.357
But liar...

34:14.592 --> 34:16.260
Wasn't one of them.

34:17.362 --> 34:19.029
Richie betrayed his own blood.

34:19.031 --> 34:21.465
Seth, wake up! Come on!

34:21.467 --> 34:23.266
We got to get out of here!

34:23.467 --> 34:25.068
What's that smell?

34:28.340 --> 34:30.540
You really gonna let
him get away with that?

35:03.341 --> 35:04.708
Yeah?

35:06.511 --> 35:07.711
It's for you.

35:14.352 --> 35:16.520
"A" for effort, boxman.

35:16.522 --> 35:19.056
But I know a Gecko when I see one.

35:19.058 --> 35:22.659
And sooner or later, we
all dance with the reaper.

35:30.402 --> 35:31.468
Tactics.

36:10.508 --> 36:12.476
All right. Come on. Come on.

36:12.478 --> 36:15.145
Oh, yeah.

36:15.147 --> 36:16.680
What are we doing in here?

36:16.682 --> 36:18.382
We need to go back. No, no.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.684
Hey, don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry.

36:20.686 --> 36:23.487
This is the most sacred room in the temple.

36:23.489 --> 36:25.856
Chances are if we wait here long enough,

36:25.858 --> 36:27.391
they'll come to us.

36:28.860 --> 36:30.427
Okay?

36:30.429 --> 36:32.496
- We'll be safe here.
- Okay.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.468
Wow.

36:38.470 --> 36:39.836
It really is incredible

36:39.838 --> 36:43.907
to have lectured about
a place for so many years

36:43.909 --> 36:46.510
and finally be standing
in the middle of it.

36:46.512 --> 36:51.615
Well, I'm glad it's been
such a thrill for you.

36:51.617 --> 36:53.483
This place really freaks me out.

36:53.485 --> 36:55.152
Oh, well, it shouldn't.

36:55.154 --> 36:58.488
Human sacrifice has
really gotten a bad rap.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.857
It's not all about the blood.

37:00.859 --> 37:03.560
It's a simple exchange, really.

37:05.463 --> 37:08.498
A pact... With the gods.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.434
What are you talking about?

37:12.203 --> 37:14.504
- Where's your sword?
- They knocked it out of my hand.

37:14.506 --> 37:15.872
How the hell are we gonna get out
of here? You don't have a weapon.

37:15.874 --> 37:17.441
Apparently, I can take a bite.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.675
Assuming that's all
they want to do is bite.

37:18.677 --> 37:19.676
I got a knife.

37:21.946 --> 37:23.013
Where the hell's my knife?

37:26.684 --> 37:28.785
Tanner took it.

37:28.787 --> 37:30.454
Why the hell would he take your knife?

37:30.456 --> 37:34.991
These people believe that
with enough sacrifice...

37:37.562 --> 37:41.565
The Vision Serpent would grant them

37:41.567 --> 37:43.700
ascension to the next realm.

37:45.536 --> 37:46.937
And it all happens right here.

37:46.939 --> 37:48.738
He's obsessed.

37:51.709 --> 37:53.944
Where's the knife? Did you take it?

37:53.946 --> 37:55.912
It belongs to the lords of the night.

37:55.914 --> 37:58.815
He has been the entire
time, since the beginning.

37:58.817 --> 38:00.584
You know, when we were in that room,

38:00.586 --> 38:02.552
it was... It was like
he was getting his kicks

38:02.554 --> 38:04.521
out of seeing my Katie up on that altar.

38:04.523 --> 38:05.889
He took her.

38:07.225 --> 38:08.825
He wanted to separate us.

38:08.827 --> 38:10.527
Why?

38:10.529 --> 38:13.630
I'd all but given up on finding this place.

38:13.632 --> 38:17.567
But then Ranger Gonzalez called me.

38:17.569 --> 38:19.636
And he sent me on my path.

38:19.638 --> 38:24.708
And along the way, I met a new friend.

38:24.710 --> 38:26.743
And he told me what I should do.

38:28.746 --> 38:30.514
Buenos dias, Professor.

38:39.791 --> 38:41.090
We got to get the hell out of here.

38:41.092 --> 38:43.092
I've already lost one kid.

38:43.094 --> 38:45.161
I'm not gonna lose another,
especially to that psychopath.

38:50.335 --> 38:52.035
What the hell was that?

39:16.528 --> 39:18.594
Scott?

39:20.464 --> 39:21.564
No!

39:21.566 --> 39:24.200
We've all got our part to play.

39:24.202 --> 39:27.336
Are you ready to fulfill
your destiny, Kate?

39:27.563 --> 39:30.431
Give it time. You'll come around.

39:31.801 --> 39:33.467
No!

39:33.469 --> 39:35.502
No!

40:12.174 --> 40:13.307
Seth Gecko.

40:13.309 --> 40:15.443
Fancy seeing you here.

40:16.945 --> 40:19.914
Go on and get. I'll deal with this one.

40:23.353 --> 40:25.052
What, are you gonna do something bad, Seth?

40:26.021 --> 40:28.155
Oh, go on and drop the money on the table.

40:29.124 --> 40:31.025
Pete, I think we got off on the wrong foot.

40:31.027 --> 40:32.226
What do you say?

40:32.228 --> 40:33.261
Damn right.

40:34.196 --> 40:36.797
- Now take a step back.
- Okay.

40:37.633 --> 40:41.102
How's it feel to be on
this end of the muzzle?

40:41.104 --> 40:42.336
Well, it isn't the first time.

40:42.338 --> 40:43.938
Probably won't be the last.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.941
It's a shame I got to
blow that confidence away

40:46.943 --> 40:48.175
on that pretty suit of yours.

40:48.177 --> 40:51.312
End of the road for los hermanos Gecko.

40:52.147 --> 40:55.483
Be cool, Seth. You be cool.

40:57.654 --> 40:59.620
- We've got a problem.
- What?

40:59.655 --> 41:00.955
Aah!

41:03.125 --> 41:05.259
Give me the code.

41:05.261 --> 41:06.394
Only Pete knows it.

41:07.129 --> 41:09.964
Okay. Okay, okay.

41:09.966 --> 41:11.933
What's the price for
a nice bottle of hooch?

41:13.101 --> 41:15.169
What's the price for
a nice bottle of hooch?

41:16.138 --> 41:17.204
4602.

41:33.422 --> 41:36.223
What the hell was that?

41:36.225 --> 41:39.160
Get downstairs. I'll cover Big Jim. Move!

41:43.198 --> 41:44.498
What the hell happened?

41:50.339 --> 41:52.106
Not bad for a Gecko.

42:10.126 --> 42:11.559
Where have you been?

42:14.262 --> 42:15.396
Here.

42:17.733 --> 42:20.101
Waiting. Just like you.

42:23.138 --> 42:26.240
You think they'll succeed?

42:26.242 --> 42:28.209
Richard's soul is pure.

42:28.211 --> 42:29.477
I'm sure of it.

42:29.479 --> 42:33.514
Richard... He's quite a find.

42:37.152 --> 42:38.352
Do you trust him?

42:38.354 --> 42:40.554
Richard thinks I'm in love with him.

42:42.357 --> 42:45.326
He would go to the end of the world for me.

42:47.095 --> 42:48.429
Who wouldn't?

42:51.266 --> 42:52.633
I did.

42:56.104 --> 42:59.373
I've had a little trouble
securing the money.

42:59.375 --> 43:01.042
What?

43:02.110 --> 43:03.477
That's unacceptable.

43:05.213 --> 43:06.580
I completely agree.

43:08.116 --> 43:09.784
So you don't know where it is?

43:09.786 --> 43:11.786
Why would I?

43:11.788 --> 43:14.588
My job was to take care of Richard.

43:14.590 --> 43:16.590
And you were supposed to
take care of the money.

43:16.592 --> 43:18.592
Well, I cannot find it.

43:18.594 --> 43:20.594
I think our trickster brothers

43:20.596 --> 43:23.064
are trying to pull a fast one.

43:26.402 --> 43:29.437
Don't worry, mi diosa.

43:29.439 --> 43:32.073
When the Geckos emerge from the labyrinth,

43:32.075 --> 43:35.743
we'll find out exactly
where everyone stands.
