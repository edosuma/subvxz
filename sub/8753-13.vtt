WEBVTT

00:10.591 --> 00:14.171
They're acting like they're still alive.

00:15.697 --> 00:18.383
Whatever's going on here
really needs to stop.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.426
It was a devil or a monster.

00:21.565 --> 00:22.741
"I have seen a ghost."

00:22.743 --> 00:23.979
There's no question in my mind

00:23.981 --> 00:25.054
that there's something evil there.

00:25.056 --> 00:26.166
The dead don't rest here.

00:27.915 --> 00:30.490
His body was completely
mutilated and half-eaten.

00:32.570 --> 00:35.782
I don't know how they're
not killing each other.

00:36.518 --> 00:38.329
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:38.331 --> 00:41.541
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.543 --> 00:43.619
What's happening?

00:43.621 --> 00:44.724
I see dead people.

00:44.726 --> 00:47.171
It seems like a devil.

00:47.173 --> 00:49.819
I speak to dead people.

00:49.821 --> 00:50.820
He's pissed off.

00:50.822 --> 00:51.990
And they speak to me.

00:51.992 --> 00:54.134
I felt real fear.

00:54.136 --> 00:57.116
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.118 --> 00:59.136
I think she's being murdered.

00:59.138 --> 01:00.755
I rely on my partner.

01:00.757 --> 01:02.025
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.027 --> 01:04.029
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.136
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:06.138 --> 01:09.355
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.357 --> 01:10.557
Nobody believes me.

01:10.559 --> 01:12.023
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.025 --> 01:14.292
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:14.294 --> 01:16.028
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.030 --> 01:18.069
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.071 --> 01:19.275
Until the very end.

01:19.277 --> 01:21.047
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:21.049 --> 01:23.254
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.256 --> 01:25.331
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.039
Or time to get out.

01:27.041 --> 01:29.710
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:43.079 --> 01:45.118
I'm in Warsaw, Indiana.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.254
It's about 40 miles west of Fort Wayne.

01:48.223 --> 01:51.832
I got a call from a guy
who runs a hotel in town.

01:51.834 --> 01:54.735
Now, he says he was a lifelong skeptic

01:54.737 --> 01:57.145
until he bought the place
about eight years ago.

02:01.221 --> 02:05.569
He says activity's so bad,
he's losing employees and customers.

02:05.571 --> 02:07.772
It's his dream business,

02:07.774 --> 02:09.774
but he says if me and
Amy can't help him out,

02:09.776 --> 02:11.981
he might have to shut the place down.

02:20.995 --> 02:22.494
Before Amy arrives,

02:22.496 --> 02:25.366
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

02:25.368 --> 02:28.237
This hotel has a lot of
artwork and historic photos

02:28.239 --> 02:30.339
that have to be covered or removed.

02:30.341 --> 02:31.608
When I'm finished,

02:31.610 --> 02:34.747
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.573
There's a lot of dead people here.

02:50.209 --> 02:55.853
They're acting like they're still alive.

02:55.855 --> 02:59.625
I'm talking, like, about 50 people here.

02:59.627 --> 03:02.433
Do you know if these
dead come inside at all?

03:02.435 --> 03:03.702
Yes, they do.

03:03.704 --> 03:08.310
They,
um... they can come and go as they please.

03:10.417 --> 03:12.554
The dead don't rest here.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.132
Well, Dan, I'm glad I'm here.

03:22.134 --> 03:23.468
Um, when we spoke on the phone,

03:23.470 --> 03:24.768
you sounded like you're at the point

03:24.770 --> 03:26.302
where you're almost ready
to close this place down

03:26.304 --> 03:28.672
because of the activity.

03:28.674 --> 03:29.674
We're having trouble

03:29.676 --> 03:31.344
with employees being scared at night.

03:31.346 --> 03:33.278
- Okay.
- I've had several quit.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.414
Customers not staying.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.483
So, give me an idea

03:36.485 --> 03:37.818
of what people are experiencing here.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.022
- What's going on?
- Knocking on the door.

03:41.024 --> 03:42.959
Things moving off the shelves.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.728
I've heard of people getting touched.

03:44.730 --> 03:46.830
This seems to be worse
the last couple years.

03:46.832 --> 03:48.666
Now, how long have you had this place?

03:48.668 --> 03:50.236
Eight years.

03:50.238 --> 03:51.538
This is a three-story building.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.506
Now, I see the restaurant
here on the first floor.

03:53.508 --> 03:54.675
What else you got going on?

03:54.677 --> 03:56.811
On the second floor, we have a sports bar,

03:56.813 --> 04:00.851
and on the third floor,
we have seven hotel rooms.

04:00.853 --> 04:02.753
Okay. So now, when you bought it,

04:02.755 --> 04:04.421
did you know it was haunted?

04:04.423 --> 04:05.790
I did not.

04:05.792 --> 04:07.726
I dismissed a lot of it.

04:07.728 --> 04:08.928
What changed your mind?

04:08.930 --> 04:11.731
I was standing at the edge of the bar,

04:11.733 --> 04:13.867
happened to look down at the floor,

04:13.869 --> 04:18.675
and I seen a black fog go across the floor

04:18.677 --> 04:21.211
and then just come up and then schoo,
just gone.

04:21.213 --> 04:22.746
What do you think's going on?

04:22.748 --> 04:25.785
Not sure 100%, but the last two years,

04:25.787 --> 04:28.053
there's a lot of... lot of bad things.

04:28.055 --> 04:29.889
Sounds like you could lose the business.

04:29.891 --> 04:31.124
Maybe.

04:31.126 --> 04:33.693
Met a lot of people here,
lot of good friends,

04:33.695 --> 04:35.495
- like to keep 'em here.
- Right.

04:35.497 --> 04:37.130
Okay.

04:39.432 --> 04:42.867
What people are seeing
is kind of like a ghost

04:42.869 --> 04:44.935
but with a black sheet on it.

04:44.937 --> 04:48.068
Everybody thinks that it
was a devil or a monster,

04:48.070 --> 04:51.139
but it's a person.

04:51.141 --> 04:54.773
He goes under, uh, in the ground,

04:54.775 --> 05:01.272
and he's, like,
always kicking, uh, the floor.

05:01.274 --> 05:04.809
Then he was showing me, like,
spinning the structure.

05:04.811 --> 05:09.277
Obviously it doesn't spin,
but I think structurally, you know,

05:09.279 --> 05:10.579
it has issues all the time

05:10.581 --> 05:12.817
because he's kind of [bleep]
with the whole thing.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.626
This thing that's under the ground

05:20.628 --> 05:28.296
causes a lot of the stuff
that's happening here.

05:28.298 --> 05:32.464
And I would think that most people

05:32.466 --> 05:36.304
probably are also thinking

05:36.306 --> 05:41.343
that there's some kind of poltergeist,
but it's not.

05:41.345 --> 05:43.713
He's in his little hole,

05:43.715 --> 05:50.653
and he projects his energy
and affects the surroundings.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.059
What's going on in here?

05:58.061 --> 06:00.262
We have a lot of things
moving around in this kitchen.

06:00.264 --> 06:01.894
We're concerned about that.

06:01.896 --> 06:04.328
For example,
the broom going across the room.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.431
The bartender...

06:05.433 --> 06:07.667
There was nobody in the kitchen at the time,

06:07.669 --> 06:09.535
and the bartender heard a lot of noise...

06:09.537 --> 06:10.503
Okay.

06:10.505 --> 06:12.636
Came out and saw the broom

06:12.638 --> 06:14.305
is in the middle of the floor here,

06:14.307 --> 06:17.609
and she knew that the last
time she walked out there

06:17.611 --> 06:18.980
she saw it on the wall back there.

06:18.982 --> 06:20.315
Okay. Nobody was in the kitchen?

06:20.317 --> 06:21.817
- Nobody was in the kitchen.
- Okay.

06:21.819 --> 06:24.253
So now,
has anything else happened in this place?

06:24.255 --> 06:26.255
Yes. The day that I purchased the building,

06:26.257 --> 06:30.527
I walked through the door,
walked past the dishwasher

06:30.529 --> 06:33.799
and stopped for some reason
and took a glance at it,

06:33.801 --> 06:36.836
and it just squirted me in
the face twice real quick.

06:36.838 --> 06:40.239
We had some, um,
more issues with plumbing with faucets

06:40.241 --> 06:41.374
going on and off.

06:41.376 --> 06:42.943
Lot of things that seem, like,

06:42.945 --> 06:45.077
to try to disrupt the
business it seems like.

06:51.587 --> 06:55.020
He has a lot of energy.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.490
It'll affect everything structurally,

06:58.492 --> 07:01.792
you know, like, water, uh, plumbing.

07:01.794 --> 07:05.563
It's a lot of him. A lot of him.

07:05.565 --> 07:07.297
Can you describe what he looks like?

07:07.299 --> 07:08.998
And he's, like, squished himself out,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.133
'cause he's in the ground, you know,

07:11.135 --> 07:15.538
and, uh, just has his legs,
which are always kicking.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.743
It's very strange.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.357
So, Leslie,
thanks for taking the time to talk to me.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.824
You've been working here for a while?

07:28.826 --> 07:32.028
About 17 years. Bartender and waitress.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.098
I've heard about all the
things that are happening here.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.298
Um, what about yourself? Any experiences?

07:36.300 --> 07:37.333
Quite a few.

07:37.335 --> 07:39.804
I had somebody tap me on the shoulder.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.406
Okay. Where were you?

07:41.408 --> 07:44.075
I was at the computer station.

07:44.077 --> 07:45.544
No one was around me.

07:45.546 --> 07:46.546
You're sure about that?

07:46.548 --> 07:48.248
Yeah. There was nobody there.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.349
And anything else?

07:49.351 --> 07:51.752
I was leaving one night

07:51.754 --> 07:55.324
and saw someone standing on the third floor

07:55.326 --> 07:57.959
in the window in the hallway.

07:57.961 --> 08:00.899
Okay. Was it a guest?

08:00.901 --> 08:03.035
No. There were no guests that night.

08:03.037 --> 08:05.136
I'm the last one here,

08:05.138 --> 08:07.971
and I know if the hotel
rooms are rented or not

08:07.973 --> 08:09.574
because we're the check-in.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.878
Okay. Describe the man to me.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.947
Tall and broad-shouldered, dark suit.

08:15.949 --> 08:17.081
A suit?

08:17.083 --> 08:19.683
Yeah, like, old-fashioned suit, bowler hat.

08:19.685 --> 08:20.851
Okay.

08:20.853 --> 08:22.419
Now, Leslie, you've been here...

08:22.421 --> 08:23.620
What? Almost 17 years.

08:23.622 --> 08:24.920
I mean, how you dealing with this?

08:24.922 --> 08:25.788
I mean, why do you stay?

08:25.790 --> 08:28.289
I love the place,

08:28.291 --> 08:32.698
but if I felt a definite threat, I would...

08:32.701 --> 08:35.066
I would probably not be here.

08:40.775 --> 08:42.409
There's a male here.

08:42.410 --> 08:44.078
He is a workaholic.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.213
He's always moving around.
He's always working.

08:47.215 --> 08:49.547
Uh, I think that they do see him.

08:49.549 --> 08:52.584
Mostly it's just solid,
normal-looking person.

08:58.090 --> 09:06.131
I think the,
uh... workaholic doesn't like people up here.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.165
He's mad.

09:08.902 --> 09:11.103
Came right to the door and was like, "Aah!"

09:13.073 --> 09:15.409
Oh, lordy.

09:15.411 --> 09:19.477
He hates this [bleep]

09:19.479 --> 09:23.015
Oh, damn. Oh, geez.

09:23.017 --> 09:25.417
Okay. He's freaking the [bleep] out.

09:25.419 --> 09:29.555
He's yelling, "Get out of here!"

09:29.557 --> 09:32.959
You know, "Leave me alone!"

09:32.961 --> 09:39.533
He invokes such rage in people.

09:40.802 --> 09:44.302
I don't know how they're
not killing each other.

10:04.861 --> 10:07.029
Now, how long did you work here?

10:07.031 --> 10:09.064
About four years. I bartended.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.200
I was talking to Danny.

10:10.202 --> 10:11.669
He said a lot of the employees

10:11.671 --> 10:13.704
quit over the stuff that happened here.

10:13.706 --> 10:16.438
What was the feeling like
for you when you worked here?

10:16.440 --> 10:18.674
I would experience fear

10:18.676 --> 10:21.679
almost as if I was a child again

10:21.681 --> 10:23.779
locked in a dark bedroom

10:23.781 --> 10:26.416
with demons under my bed
and monsters in my closet.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.021
That's how bad it was?

10:29.023 --> 10:30.555
What about experiences? Have you had any?

10:30.557 --> 10:31.822
Yes.

10:31.824 --> 10:37.962
When I was closing the bar,
I witnessed a shadow

10:37.964 --> 10:42.966
that actually resembled
a man directly behind me,

10:42.968 --> 10:44.937
and it was, like, 7, 8 foot tall.

10:44.939 --> 10:47.074
What did you do?

10:47.076 --> 10:48.941
I was in shock.
I didn't really know what to do,

10:48.943 --> 10:50.376
and from that point,

10:50.378 --> 10:53.715
- I was just, like, "I have seen a ghost."
- Geez.

10:53.717 --> 10:55.084
- You have anything else?
- Yes.

10:55.086 --> 10:57.520
I was working in here,

10:57.522 --> 10:59.254
and I was pushing in the barstools,

10:59.256 --> 11:03.323
and I got to about this barstool right here

11:03.325 --> 11:06.395
and as I went to push it in,
it almost just moved for me.

11:06.397 --> 11:08.698
Show me what happened when
the chair moved on you.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.832
Okay.

11:09.834 --> 11:13.303
I put my foot on it and grabbed here,

11:13.305 --> 11:15.139
and then I went to push it,
and as I went to push it,

11:15.141 --> 11:18.811
it was almost, like,
it just moved for me so gracefully.

11:18.813 --> 11:21.978
All right. Now, these are heavy.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.445
They're not...

11:23.447 --> 11:24.280
Right.

11:24.282 --> 11:27.482
These aren't light.

11:27.484 --> 11:29.285
I mean, you got to push it.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.322
I can't even try to debunk that.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.622
I just really feel like
there's something here.

11:39.396 --> 11:41.933
The workaholic, he's pissed off.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.801
I mean, he's doing things with the chairs.

11:48.308 --> 11:53.011
I feel like he has pushed
living people definitely.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.883
You know, he's like, "This is my space."

11:58.084 --> 12:01.118
"Get out of the way, 'cause here I come."

12:04.655 --> 12:07.492
And definitely they got to
feel this [bleep] energy,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.629
like, it is so intense.

12:09.631 --> 12:12.935
It is so directed.

12:12.937 --> 12:17.843
I just feel like massive amounts of tension,

12:17.845 --> 12:22.413
the heart, you know, just [bleep] pound...

12:22.415 --> 12:23.748
Like, I'd almost think some people,

12:23.750 --> 12:24.916
they can't [bleep] breathe here.

12:32.325 --> 12:33.691
Now, Kathy, I understand

12:33.693 --> 12:35.158
that you actually worked at
the hotel for a little bit.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.159
- Is that right?
- Yes.

12:36.161 --> 12:38.461
I worked there for about six months,

12:38.463 --> 12:41.166
but I've been a customer for about 15 years.

12:41.168 --> 12:42.434
Now, did you stop working there

12:42.436 --> 12:43.669
because of what was going on?

12:43.671 --> 12:45.838
That was a very big part of it.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.706
Yeah. I read the signs.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.341
You know, somebody was warning me

12:49.343 --> 12:50.641
about something, so, um... Okay.

12:50.643 --> 12:51.941
Now,
what kind of things are we talking about?

12:51.943 --> 12:54.846
When I was a patron sitting
at the bar one evening,

12:54.848 --> 12:59.152
um, I turned,
and I saw two apparitions in booth one.

12:59.154 --> 13:02.322
Okay. How do you know they were apparitions?

13:02.324 --> 13:05.428
I said to the waitress,
"You've got people in booth one?"

13:05.430 --> 13:08.032
And she turned and said,
"Kath, there's nobody there."

13:08.034 --> 13:08.967
So it couldn't have been

13:08.969 --> 13:10.137
a mirror reflection of anything?

13:10.139 --> 13:11.572
No. There's no mirror anywhere near it.

13:11.574 --> 13:12.773
- Near it.
- Nope.

13:12.775 --> 13:13.908
Anything else?

13:13.910 --> 13:16.879
One full moon night, the bar was closed,

13:16.881 --> 13:18.882
and looked up, and on the third floor,

13:18.884 --> 13:21.522
I saw a man in the middle window,

13:21.524 --> 13:25.257
and it was like he was looking
up and down the street.

13:25.259 --> 13:26.858
You know,
you're the second person to tell me that.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.058
What'd he look like?

13:28.060 --> 13:32.363
He had a fedora,
so he kind of resembled a gangster.

13:32.365 --> 13:33.930
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:33.932 --> 13:35.029
Would you recognize him

13:35.031 --> 13:36.896
if you saw him in a photo or a sketch?

13:36.898 --> 13:38.264
I believe so. Yes. Mm-hmm.

13:38.266 --> 13:39.500
Anything else?

13:39.502 --> 13:42.337
When I was working and
I was doing the dishes,

13:42.339 --> 13:45.641
- I was by the, uh, sink...
- Okay.

13:45.643 --> 13:47.473
And I felt a tug on my apron.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.039
Was anybody walking by you at the time?

13:49.041 --> 13:50.303
No. No.

13:50.305 --> 13:53.302
'Cause I looked around,
and there was nobody around me.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.771
So you've had a lot of experiences there.

13:55.773 --> 13:57.540
What do you think is going on in this place?

13:57.542 --> 13:58.707
There's no question in my mind

13:58.709 --> 14:00.608
that there's something evil there.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.913
The workaholic likes this floor.

14:05.915 --> 14:09.447
He is, like,
putting pillows on people's faces.

14:13.953 --> 14:18.458
He does not like, um,
drug addicts and whores.

14:18.460 --> 14:23.966
His thing of, you know,
getting the people [bleep] up,

14:23.968 --> 14:26.199
and he's smothering 'em.

14:26.201 --> 14:27.334
He's trying to kill 'em

14:27.336 --> 14:29.371
with the [bleep] smothering 'em to death.

14:29.373 --> 14:31.575
Somehow made it look like a heart attack.

14:34.778 --> 14:39.751
Makes me feel very
uncomfortable and panicked.

14:39.753 --> 14:48.327
There's some talk he may have killed someone

14:48.329 --> 14:50.361
after he is dead.

15:06.224 --> 15:08.359
Dan and his
employees didn't know much

15:08.361 --> 15:10.229
about the history of the Barbee Hotel,

15:10.231 --> 15:12.534
so I'm at the local library
to see what I can find.

15:14.470 --> 15:17.735
Searching through old records,
I find a man named Joseph Plu

15:17.737 --> 15:20.904
who used to live on my client's
property in the late 1800s.

15:20.906 --> 15:23.641
Turns out he was accused
of a brutal double murder

15:23.643 --> 15:24.975
at his neighbor's house.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.016
I've called on my old friend Butch Barile.

15:31.018 --> 15:32.517
He's a local retired detective.

15:32.519 --> 15:34.484
He said he'd dig into the case for me

15:34.486 --> 15:36.318
and tell me exactly what happened.

15:42.022 --> 15:44.752
February of 1887,
I come across an article,

15:44.754 --> 15:47.751
this kid Joseph Plu who got
charged with a double murder

15:47.753 --> 15:50.021
right on the property I'm investigating.

15:50.023 --> 15:51.289
What were you able to find out?

15:51.291 --> 15:55.623
Joseph Plu lived on your client's land

15:55.625 --> 16:00.896
with his grandparents
next to a Henry Dunham,

16:00.898 --> 16:03.563
who had hired Joseph Plu

16:03.565 --> 16:05.798
to work and help him on his farm.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.167
So, what kind of a crime
scene are we looking at?

16:07.169 --> 16:08.167
What happened?

16:08.169 --> 16:09.467
So, it was, uh...

16:09.469 --> 16:12.103
it was a pretty grisly crime scene.

16:12.105 --> 16:17.378
Henry, he had a 20-month-old baby,
a daughter,

16:17.380 --> 16:20.913
and her throat was slit ear to ear.

16:20.915 --> 16:22.951
The other victim was Henry himself.

16:22.953 --> 16:24.219
Okay.

16:24.221 --> 16:28.023
He was found out in the yard
with several stab wounds

16:28.025 --> 16:32.159
and, uh, it's thought that hogs got to him.

16:32.161 --> 16:33.996
His body was completely mutilated

16:33.998 --> 16:35.498
and half-eaten, literally.

16:38.535 --> 16:42.307
I see, like, somebody's face being [bleep]

16:42.309 --> 16:45.309
I feel like it's a male.

16:45.311 --> 16:49.714
He's, like, very much in pain right now,

16:49.716 --> 16:51.716
and he can't breathe.

16:51.718 --> 16:54.186
Ow!

16:55.822 --> 17:01.792
Something... got hit in the head,
maybe, here.

17:01.794 --> 17:04.262
I know there's a few people.

17:06.332 --> 17:07.500
There's more than one.

17:07.502 --> 17:10.671
I think he's just in his death state.

17:10.673 --> 17:14.375
There's so much pain in my head.

17:14.377 --> 17:15.944
Oh, my God.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.750
So what happens next?

17:18.752 --> 17:21.887
A neighbor happened to be
walking near the property,

17:21.888 --> 17:23.654
found him laying there,

17:23.656 --> 17:27.022
went inside the house and found Lucy Dunham,

17:27.025 --> 17:31.065
Henry's wife,
who was just barely clinging to life.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.732
She also had several stab wounds

17:33.734 --> 17:35.634
and... and severe head injuries.

17:35.636 --> 17:36.669
So now, at the time,

17:36.671 --> 17:38.438
Plu lived on my client's property,

17:38.440 --> 17:40.474
and I'm assuming now that
'cause she survived,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.343
she identifies him as the perp.

17:42.345 --> 17:45.549
She identifies him, but also she knew

17:45.551 --> 17:48.551
there were two other people there,

17:48.553 --> 17:50.954
but she couldn't identify either one of 'em.

17:50.956 --> 17:53.191
Now, there's a lot of rage in this case,

17:53.193 --> 17:55.861
and what would motivate this kid,
Plu, to do this?

17:55.863 --> 17:58.196
My understanding is that
there was a lot of animosity

17:58.198 --> 17:59.431
between him and the wife.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.799
- Okay.
- They'd have some confrontations

18:01.801 --> 18:02.933
and some problems.

18:02.935 --> 18:05.234
- He didn't really care for her.
- Okay.

18:05.236 --> 18:07.836
In fact, I think they'd had some problems

18:07.838 --> 18:10.871
with Mr. Dunham arguing over,
you know, over pay.

18:10.873 --> 18:14.475
Joseph Plu, he had some... some cash on him.

18:14.477 --> 18:17.346
He had $90, my understanding was,

18:17.348 --> 18:21.282
and I think some of it
had bloodstains on it.

18:21.284 --> 18:22.687
Okay.

18:22.689 --> 18:25.155
You and I both know that this
is not the type of murder,

18:25.157 --> 18:27.489
especially with this baby
that you commit over $85...

18:27.491 --> 18:28.792
No... or whatever money.

18:28.794 --> 18:31.264
No, not at all.

18:31.266 --> 18:34.332
It was, uh, some, you know,
severe hatred involved.

18:34.334 --> 18:36.702
Wow. Okay.

18:36.704 --> 18:40.341
There's a dead lady.

18:40.343 --> 18:43.310
She's, like, hanging on.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.547
She's, like, hanging on to my leg.

18:45.549 --> 18:49.253
She's, like, being dragged across the floor.

18:49.255 --> 18:52.992
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:52.994 --> 18:55.160
She, like...

18:55.162 --> 18:56.896
I don't know what the
[bleep] happened to her, man.

18:56.898 --> 18:58.264
She got [bleep]

18:58.266 --> 19:00.334
I think that somebody killed her.

19:04.273 --> 19:08.743
There's a couple of men around her.

19:08.745 --> 19:09.809
I feel them.

19:09.811 --> 19:13.614
She knew one for sure.

19:13.616 --> 19:16.318
Why is my friend doing this?

19:16.320 --> 19:22.088
Someone says it's a brutal
assault with a little knife.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.494
I feel like someone got stabbed.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.296
Uh...

19:32.565 --> 19:34.631
Okay. So now, Plu gets charged.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.199
Does he get convicted? What's the story?

19:37.201 --> 19:39.235
Plu does get charged and gets convicted,

19:39.237 --> 19:42.508
and he, uh... he takes a life sentence.

19:42.510 --> 19:43.676
All right.

19:43.678 --> 19:46.444
So, does this kid end up
dying in jail or what?

19:46.446 --> 19:50.917
No. So, what happens is he
ends up serving 29 years.

19:50.919 --> 19:55.457
Henry Dunham's wife comes back and says

19:55.459 --> 19:58.860
that she can't confirm for
sure that he did do it.

19:58.862 --> 20:00.230
After 29 years.

20:00.232 --> 20:03.767
After 29 years,
so he gets a pardon and he gets out.

20:03.769 --> 20:04.967
Wow.

20:04.969 --> 20:08.907
And this is Plu 29 years later

20:08.909 --> 20:10.510
when he gets released.

20:10.512 --> 20:13.414
Now, how old is Plu when he gets out?

20:13.416 --> 20:14.347
He's 53.

20:14.349 --> 20:16.551
All right. So he get's pardoned.

20:16.553 --> 20:19.323
Do they look at anybody else as a suspect?

20:19.325 --> 20:20.523
No.

20:20.525 --> 20:24.127
It's still, for all practical purposes...

20:24.129 --> 20:25.730
- Unsolved?
- ...unsolved.

20:28.701 --> 20:33.004
This dead guy,
someone's calling him derogatory names.

20:33.006 --> 20:34.639
What do they say?

20:34.641 --> 20:36.876
They're saying that he's gay and stuff.

20:36.878 --> 20:40.114
What are you shaking your head about?

20:40.116 --> 20:43.920
I don't understand how this
could be such a violent place.

20:47.188 --> 20:49.056
It's too much.

20:49.058 --> 20:53.196
Makes me feel very
uncomfortable and panicked.

20:53.198 --> 20:58.036
I feel very, very sad, like I want to cry.

21:15.998 --> 21:17.832
One of the first things I do on a case

21:17.834 --> 21:19.467
is reach out to local historians.

21:19.469 --> 21:23.972
Usually I don't turn up too much,
but in this case,

21:23.974 --> 21:25.741
a local genealogist tells me

21:25.743 --> 21:28.977
that the man that built
Dan's hotel has a wild story

21:28.979 --> 21:30.343
and I'm definitely gonna want to hear it.

21:38.117 --> 21:39.482
Well, Beth, thanks for meeting me.

21:39.484 --> 21:40.584
I appreciate that.

21:40.586 --> 21:42.187
You mentioned on the phone

21:42.189 --> 21:44.654
that the guy that originally built the hotel

21:44.656 --> 21:46.291
on the property I'm investigating

21:46.293 --> 21:48.028
had an interesting story behind him?

21:48.030 --> 21:49.698
Yes. His name was Henry Hover.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.567
He was a farmer.

21:51.569 --> 21:55.505
This is a photo that we
found when he was farming.

21:55.507 --> 21:59.045
He... you can see he's at
the end of the photo here.

21:59.047 --> 22:02.115
Okay. So, how does he go from being a farmer

22:02.117 --> 22:03.585
to building a hotel?

22:03.587 --> 22:08.291
He started amassing that property in 1880,

22:08.293 --> 22:10.993
and it took him 17 years,

22:10.995 --> 22:14.495
but in 1897, he got the hotel.

22:14.497 --> 22:18.264
These are the photos of
the hotel that we have.

22:18.266 --> 22:21.968
He... he just stuck to his vision.

22:21.970 --> 22:24.169
Okay. So now he has his dream hotel.

22:24.171 --> 22:25.270
What happens?

22:25.272 --> 22:26.739
Does he live there happily ever after?

22:26.741 --> 22:27.942
I mean, what's the story?

22:27.944 --> 22:31.112
No. Henry just has one
tragedy after another.

22:31.114 --> 22:33.613
1897, the year the hotel's built,

22:33.615 --> 22:35.917
he loses a son Ira who's sick.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.751
He dies of unknown causes.

22:37.753 --> 22:41.958
In 1901,
his wife loses a child in childbirth.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.524
The biggest tragedy happened in 1902,

22:44.526 --> 22:47.193
when he lost his 3-year-old son, Elmer,

22:47.195 --> 22:49.396
to an accident.

22:49.398 --> 22:52.966
Elmer is playing in the hotel.

22:52.968 --> 22:54.868
They work there. They live there.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.203
He's trying to climb on top of a bean sack

22:57.205 --> 22:59.273
to get up to the counter.

22:59.275 --> 23:03.144
His foot slips and his
little chin hits the counter,

23:03.146 --> 23:04.643
and broke his neck.

23:04.645 --> 23:07.879
Within 20 minutes, little Elmer is gone.

23:07.881 --> 23:10.451
So what happens after all this?

23:10.453 --> 23:11.986
He runs into financial trouble,

23:11.988 --> 23:15.757
and in 1906, sells the hotel for a loss.

23:15.759 --> 23:18.629
Okay.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.797
He dies at the age of 68

23:20.799 --> 23:24.633
after being confined in bed
for a year from tuberculosis.

23:24.635 --> 23:26.469
- You're kidding me?
- Nope.

23:26.471 --> 23:29.272
So what happened with the hotel?

23:29.274 --> 23:31.510
It burned down in the 1920s,

23:31.512 --> 23:34.813
and the hotel you see today is a rebuild,

23:34.815 --> 23:37.383
but it looks very similar to the original.

23:41.992 --> 23:47.862
I want to say that he... owned this place

23:47.864 --> 23:55.565
or was in charge of this place,
um, or thinks he is still.

23:57.935 --> 23:59.235
The workaholic guy?

23:59.237 --> 24:00.703
Yes.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.472
Do you know anything about
what he was like in life?

24:02.474 --> 24:05.777
He's, like, between 55 and 60.

24:05.779 --> 24:10.283
He came from a... a hardworking background,

24:10.285 --> 24:16.661
and he feels he did well
until this happened.

24:16.663 --> 24:22.069
He's still acting like he is working.

24:22.071 --> 24:26.041
He just goes and he just
does what he did every day.

24:26.043 --> 24:29.146
That's what makes him feel comfortable.

24:35.385 --> 24:38.422
Beth mentioned that Dan's
building ended up burning down.

24:38.424 --> 24:41.258
Obviously,
I need to find out exactly what happened.

24:41.260 --> 24:44.493
I'm heading over to meet
with a local firefighter.

24:44.495 --> 24:48.167
He says the cause of the fire
is still a mystery to this day.

24:54.675 --> 24:56.376
Well, Chief, thanks for meeting me.

24:56.378 --> 24:57.411
I appreciate it.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.079
So now, the expert I talked to said

24:59.081 --> 25:01.545
that the hotel I'm investigating
burnt down in the '20s,

25:01.547 --> 25:03.780
- and you said it was true.
- Absolutely.

25:03.782 --> 25:05.950
August 18, 1921,

25:05.952 --> 25:08.285
the fire completely destroyed the hotel.

25:08.287 --> 25:09.452
Okay.

25:09.454 --> 25:11.719
This is one of the articles.

25:11.721 --> 25:13.255
What was the story with it?

25:13.257 --> 25:15.496
The fire started in the attic area

25:15.498 --> 25:16.764
and then it went

25:16.766 --> 25:19.535
and it slowly started to
burn across the attic.

25:19.537 --> 25:22.238
Okay. Now, what about casualties, anything?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.538
It's my understanding

25:23.540 --> 25:25.741
that there was roughly 50 people there

25:25.743 --> 25:27.946
when the fire started, and not a one of them

25:27.948 --> 25:30.082
suffered an injury or a death.

25:30.084 --> 25:31.715
Okay.
So, they were able to get everybody out...

25:31.717 --> 25:33.184
- Yes...
- before the building collapsed.

25:33.186 --> 25:34.486
All right. So, do we know, Chief,

25:34.488 --> 25:35.821
exactly what even started the fire?

25:35.823 --> 25:38.790
The articles I've read said
spontaneous combustion.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.393
There was no electrical wiring in the attic,

25:41.395 --> 25:42.694
so they ruled that out

25:42.696 --> 25:45.097
and they went to spontaneous combustion.

25:45.099 --> 25:46.865
All right. So, in your opinion,
though, what do you think?

25:46.867 --> 25:48.367
I don't know that we'll ever know.

25:50.570 --> 25:57.109
There's been a lot of
things that have happened.

25:57.111 --> 25:59.712
It's kind of crazy.

25:59.714 --> 26:03.882
There was a fire, but I don't know

26:03.884 --> 26:07.717
if it was actually this structure

26:07.719 --> 26:09.352
or if there was another structure.

26:11.558 --> 26:15.325
It's residual, but it happened.

26:24.964 --> 26:27.566
I saw several dead people on my walk,

26:27.568 --> 26:30.773
but the workaholic is
the most advanced entity.

26:30.775 --> 26:32.241
I'm meeting with an artist

26:32.243 --> 26:34.342
to describe how he appeared in life.

26:36.245 --> 26:42.288
He's probably between
55 and 60 years of age.

26:42.290 --> 26:45.860
He has a very thick, full head of gray hair.

26:49.098 --> 26:52.066
His nose has been probably
broken a few times.

27:00.509 --> 27:02.279
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:23.336 --> 27:26.303
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:26.305 --> 27:29.341
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

27:29.343 --> 27:31.708
and our clients for the first time.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.042
Well, Amy, I'd like you to meet Dan.

27:34.044 --> 27:36.112
He is the owner of this restaurant/hotel

27:36.114 --> 27:37.448
for about eight years now.

27:37.450 --> 27:39.982
Activity here is bad and it's getting worse,

27:39.984 --> 27:44.148
and it's hurting his business
and if it keeps going like this,

27:44.150 --> 27:46.115
he's gonna have to shut the place down.

27:46.117 --> 27:48.484
Leslie here has worked here for 17 years?

27:48.486 --> 27:50.386
She's had ton of experiences,

27:50.388 --> 27:53.123
and I kind of think she's
numb to it at this point.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.353
Now, Kathy lives directly across the street.

27:55.355 --> 27:56.787
She's been here for 15 years.

27:56.789 --> 28:00.458
She actually worked in the
restaurant for six months.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.093
She thinks that whatever's here is evil,

28:03.095 --> 28:06.061
and that Dan and his
staff could be in danger.

28:06.063 --> 28:08.399
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

28:08.401 --> 28:11.036
I'm gonna have her talk about her walk.

28:15.241 --> 28:17.479
So one of the first things that I got

28:17.481 --> 28:19.351
when I got out of the vehicle

28:19.353 --> 28:21.087
was that there had been a fire here.

28:21.089 --> 28:23.722
I was smelling it and tasting it,

28:23.724 --> 28:27.194
and I felt like people were
breathing in the smoke,

28:27.196 --> 28:29.795
and I didn't know if it was this structure

28:29.797 --> 28:31.195
or a structure nearby.

28:31.197 --> 28:33.796
Well, you hit that pretty much on the head.

28:33.798 --> 28:37.199
Now, the hotel opened in 1897.

28:37.201 --> 28:39.568
It was opened up as the Hotel Ormond.

28:39.570 --> 28:43.703
But back on August 18, 1921,
the building caught on fire.

28:43.705 --> 28:45.537
It started in the attic.

28:45.539 --> 28:47.741
They tried dousing it out,
but you know what?

28:47.743 --> 28:48.642
They had no shot.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.843
Now, nobody died in that fire,

28:50.845 --> 28:54.581
but there were 50 people
staying here at the time,

28:54.583 --> 28:58.746
but they all got out safely,
and I have an article here about it.

28:58.748 --> 29:01.450
Now, two years later, the hotel was rebuilt

29:01.452 --> 29:02.916
and that's the building we're in right now.

29:02.918 --> 29:04.017
That makes sense.

29:07.825 --> 29:10.493
One of the first conscious entities

29:10.495 --> 29:13.563
that I encountered was on the first floor.

29:13.565 --> 29:17.133
Um, so he was really strange,
because what I saw him doing

29:17.135 --> 29:21.038
was, like, burrowing under the ground.

29:21.040 --> 29:26.808
And he's, like,
always kicking, uh, the floor.

29:26.810 --> 29:31.348
Then he was showing me, like,
spinning the structure.

29:31.350 --> 29:34.384
I think structurally, you know,
it has issues all the time

29:34.386 --> 29:37.053
because he's kind of [bleep]
with the whole thing.

29:37.055 --> 29:40.122
But what I saw as a direct result of that

29:40.124 --> 29:43.794
was causing issues with, like, plumbing

29:43.796 --> 29:46.965
or electricity or things breaking.

29:46.967 --> 29:49.431
Dan, the first day in this place,

29:49.433 --> 29:52.366
you had issues with the water, right?

29:52.368 --> 29:56.499
Yes. As I walked in and
walked past the dishwasher,

29:56.501 --> 29:59.037
and stopped and turned and
looked at it for some reason,

29:59.039 --> 30:02.142
and, um,
it squirted me right in the face twice.

30:02.144 --> 30:04.411
I mean, you've been here the longest.

30:04.413 --> 30:05.613
Long time.

30:05.615 --> 30:07.783
So, as far as the structural issues,

30:07.785 --> 30:10.287
has this been ongoing?

30:10.289 --> 30:11.621
Yeah.

30:11.623 --> 30:12.689
I mean, some of it you chalk
up to it's an old building.

30:12.691 --> 30:16.625
But we have a lot of electrical glitches

30:16.627 --> 30:17.693
and computer glitches.

30:17.695 --> 30:19.328
That happens a lot.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.496
Interesting.

30:24.766 --> 30:26.635
Okay. So what else did you see?

30:26.637 --> 30:28.171
During my walk, I came across

30:28.173 --> 30:29.940
a couple of murder scenes,

30:29.942 --> 30:33.278
and one of them involved
a female in the bar area.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.181
So I walk over there

30:35.183 --> 30:39.819
and this woman, like,
grabbed on to my lower legs

30:39.821 --> 30:42.289
and was, like,
dragging herself on the floor.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.558
She was beaten.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.827
There were three men that
were involved at least.

30:46.829 --> 30:50.869
She knew one of them most certainly.

30:50.871 --> 30:53.338
I kept hearing, like,
while all this chaos is going on,

30:53.340 --> 30:55.539
like, the guys were laughing.

30:55.541 --> 30:57.672
It was excruciatingly painful.

30:59.373 --> 31:01.006
The next murder victim I encountered

31:01.008 --> 31:02.139
was a male outside

31:02.141 --> 31:04.240
who was stuck in his death state.

31:04.242 --> 31:08.475
I started feeling like a
really sharp pain in my chest,

31:08.477 --> 31:11.043
and so I think he was stabbed.

31:11.045 --> 31:14.311
And I'm hearing these men clearly,
like, yelling at me,

31:14.313 --> 31:16.282
like, horrible, really awful things.

31:16.284 --> 31:20.152
And I think there was some
kind of issue with him

31:20.154 --> 31:22.621
where these males might have thought

31:22.623 --> 31:25.691
that he was a homosexual or
something of that nature.

31:25.693 --> 31:27.425
There was a double murder

31:27.427 --> 31:30.326
that had strong connection to this place.

31:30.328 --> 31:31.694
It happened in 1887.

31:31.696 --> 31:34.563
A guy by the name of Joseph Plu lived here.

31:34.565 --> 31:37.131
Now, I got a photo of him.

31:37.133 --> 31:40.067
Now, he lived next door to
a guy named Henry Dunham.

31:40.069 --> 31:42.236
And now, Henry lived on the property

31:42.238 --> 31:44.005
with his wife and 20-month-old daughter.

31:44.007 --> 31:46.472
So he needed to hire somebody
to work on the farm for him,

31:46.474 --> 31:47.439
and he hired this guy.

31:47.441 --> 31:51.543
Now, on February 7, 1887,

31:51.545 --> 31:53.446
this is when a brutal crime takes place.

31:53.448 --> 31:54.747
Henry was stabbed repeatedly.

31:54.749 --> 31:58.820
They find Henry in the barn area outside.

31:58.822 --> 32:01.289
He's stabbed to death
and his body's mutilated

32:01.291 --> 32:04.157
because he had hogs on the property

32:04.159 --> 32:06.924
that basically went to town on him,
and they ate him.

32:06.926 --> 32:10.927
Now, inside,
his 20-month-old daughter was also murdered.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.328
It was pretty brutal.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.127
She was cut from ear to ear,

32:14.129 --> 32:16.627
practically almost right to the point

32:16.629 --> 32:18.362
where her head was cut off.

32:18.364 --> 32:21.633
His wife Lucy was stabbed
several times and beaten,

32:21.635 --> 32:23.434
but she survived actually.

32:23.436 --> 32:25.971
This is where it gets interesting.

32:25.973 --> 32:27.875
She told the cops that
there were three attackers,

32:27.877 --> 32:29.675
and one of them was Plu.

32:29.677 --> 32:31.545
She's like, "Yeah.
It was him and two other guys,"

32:31.547 --> 32:33.248
that she couldn't identify.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.214
He's the only one that gets charged.

32:35.216 --> 32:38.418
29 years later, Lucy comes back and says,

32:38.420 --> 32:39.820
"I'm not sure Plu was at the crime scene."

32:39.822 --> 32:42.056
This is after the guy's
in jail for 29 years.

32:42.058 --> 32:43.423
So why would she retract that?

32:43.425 --> 32:46.025
Your guess is as good as mine.

32:46.027 --> 32:49.127
It's still a mystery to this day, this case.

32:49.129 --> 32:51.562
This is actually a picture
of Plu when he came out,

32:51.564 --> 32:54.397
29 years later.

32:54.399 --> 32:56.433
This is, uh... this is him.

32:57.802 --> 32:59.102
Did you know about any of this?

32:59.104 --> 33:00.839
'Cause you seem upset about it,

33:00.841 --> 33:03.343
and I know it's a terrible story.

33:03.345 --> 33:05.611
When she spoke about the woman,

33:05.613 --> 33:09.813
um... I've gotten feelings about,

33:09.815 --> 33:13.546
uh, a lady, um, that was, uh, raped

33:13.548 --> 33:15.647
and... and murdered.

33:15.649 --> 33:16.848
So I felt it.

33:16.850 --> 33:20.721
You know, it was, uh,
by more than just one person.

33:20.723 --> 33:24.188
Her spirit had came through me

33:24.190 --> 33:26.224
and talked with me

33:26.226 --> 33:30.590
and, uh... um, she... she's,
like, telling me

33:30.592 --> 33:32.359
that she was forced to retract that.

33:32.361 --> 33:34.296
Oh, interesting. Okay.

33:34.298 --> 33:36.799
Well, let me ask you a question.
Do you think she has abilities?

33:36.801 --> 33:38.632
Yes.

33:38.634 --> 33:41.133
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, I do.

33:41.135 --> 33:45.270
It seems to me that she wants people

33:45.272 --> 33:47.872
to know exactly what happened.

33:47.874 --> 33:51.145
She wants, you know, the truth to be told.

33:51.147 --> 33:53.815
I think it was him.

33:53.817 --> 33:55.384
They raped her.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.321
All right.

34:00.323 --> 34:01.756
So what else happened on your walk?

34:01.758 --> 34:03.624
One of the people that I encountered,

34:03.626 --> 34:05.291
he seemed to me to be

34:05.293 --> 34:08.895
the most physically
present dead person here.

34:08.897 --> 34:13.800
And he came off very much
as like a workaholic,

34:13.802 --> 34:17.806
but when I went upstairs, very different.

34:17.808 --> 34:20.172
He was like, "Get the [bleep] out of there.

34:20.174 --> 34:22.742
This is... this is my... my space."

34:22.744 --> 34:27.315
One of the ways that he
sometimes shows himself

34:27.317 --> 34:31.319
is as a tall, shadow-type figure.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.786
Now, you've seen a guy

34:33.789 --> 34:35.492
in the window upstairs, though, right?

34:35.494 --> 34:36.659
- A tall guy?
- Yes.

34:36.661 --> 34:38.192
And when I've seen him,

34:38.194 --> 34:40.594
he was just, like, looking down

34:40.596 --> 34:43.463
each side of the street as to see if he...

34:43.465 --> 34:45.301
he's looking for someone,

34:45.303 --> 34:46.969
like a lookout-type of a guy.

34:46.971 --> 34:48.369
Mm-hmm.

34:48.371 --> 34:51.772
You saw it leaving work
one day when nobody's here.

34:51.774 --> 34:52.905
Yeah.

34:52.907 --> 34:54.775
There was nobody in the
building when I left.

34:54.777 --> 34:56.145
Mm-hmm.

34:56.147 --> 34:57.947
Did you get any sense

34:57.949 --> 34:59.613
of who this guy might have
been when he was alive?

34:59.615 --> 35:04.588
He worked his whole life
to do well for himself,

35:04.590 --> 35:07.721
and he felt like he did do well for himself.

35:07.723 --> 35:10.094
I thought that he either owned this place

35:10.096 --> 35:11.997
or was in charge of this place.

35:11.999 --> 35:15.997
And, uh, he thinks that he's still...

35:15.999 --> 35:17.799
- Running it...
- running it.

35:17.801 --> 35:21.539
Uh, I got that he was
between 55 and 60 years old.

35:21.541 --> 35:28.278
His moods seemed to be
very drastic ups and downs,

35:28.280 --> 35:29.546
ups and downs.

35:29.548 --> 35:31.515
And he's still like that.

35:31.517 --> 35:35.122
Well,
it makes me think of the guy Henry Hover

35:35.124 --> 35:36.522
that originally built this place.

35:36.524 --> 35:39.590
Now, he was a hard worker,
he was a workaholic.

35:39.592 --> 35:40.859
He was a farmer.

35:40.861 --> 35:43.564
In 1880,
he started buying little pieces of land.

35:43.566 --> 35:47.868
Took him 17 years to buy the
property and build this hotel,

35:47.870 --> 35:49.437
which was his dream.

35:51.173 --> 35:54.075
I have the only known photo of this guy,

35:54.077 --> 35:55.543
and it's not a very good one.

35:58.013 --> 36:00.415
You mentioned he was an emotional wreck.

36:00.417 --> 36:02.719
Well, he lost his son Ira at the age of 6

36:02.721 --> 36:05.090
from unknown causes from what we can tell.

36:05.092 --> 36:07.360
1901, his wife lost a baby boy at birth,

36:07.362 --> 36:10.664
and then in 1902,
the biggest tragedy happened

36:10.666 --> 36:15.271
to this guy, his 3-year-old son,
Elmer, fell off a bag of beans.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.337
He was playing in the hotel,

36:17.339 --> 36:20.271
and the fall broke the poor kid's neck.

36:20.273 --> 36:21.706
And he basically died about 20 minutes later

36:21.708 --> 36:23.106
after they found him.

36:23.108 --> 36:25.108
To make matters worse for this guy, in 1906,

36:25.110 --> 36:27.377
he comes into some hard times financially

36:27.379 --> 36:29.746
and has to sell this place at a great loss.

36:29.748 --> 36:31.949
Now, did you get a good look at the guy?

36:31.951 --> 36:32.916
Yes, I did.

36:32.918 --> 36:35.319
And I had a sketch done of him.

36:35.321 --> 36:36.386
Okay.

36:41.226 --> 36:44.292
Take a look at this.

36:52.472 --> 36:56.111
The sketch looks exactly
like this man right here.

37:00.014 --> 37:01.447
Looks just like him.

37:01.449 --> 37:03.817
- This sketch you did looks just like Plu...
- Right.

37:03.819 --> 37:05.420
The more I'm looking at it.

37:05.422 --> 37:06.955
Oh, my gosh.

37:06.957 --> 37:08.658
Yeah. It all makes sense. Okay.

37:26.742 --> 37:29.544
- This sketch you did looks just like Plu...
- Right.

37:29.546 --> 37:31.444
The more I'm looking at it.

37:31.446 --> 37:32.578
Oh, my gosh.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.410
Yeah. It all makes sense. Okay.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.619
It matches, like,
the murder that he did on that guy,

37:43.621 --> 37:45.788
the things he was saying.

37:45.790 --> 37:49.025
Yeah. It totally makes sense.

37:49.027 --> 37:51.459
So do you think this guy Plu

37:51.461 --> 37:54.864
is the guy that you ran
into on the second floor?

37:54.866 --> 37:56.097
- Yeah.
- Okay. 'Cause it makes sense.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.730
And the second and third floor for sure.
Yeah.

37:58.732 --> 38:00.967
So how'd this guy Plu make you think

38:00.969 --> 38:03.369
he was the workaholic on the top floors?

38:03.371 --> 38:06.404
Because there's so much
residual information,

38:06.406 --> 38:12.817
I feel like he's able to,
you know, almost disguise himself

38:12.819 --> 38:15.351
within all of this information that exists.

38:15.353 --> 38:19.089
The third floor, the second floor,
and the underneath,

38:19.091 --> 38:20.389
I think is all the same person.

38:20.391 --> 38:22.256
Okay. So, the guy that you encountered

38:22.258 --> 38:23.421
- that's kicking the fl...
- Yeah.

38:23.423 --> 38:26.426
- Making the pipes burst.
- Yes.

38:26.428 --> 38:29.029
The aggressive guy on the
second floor we think is Plu.

38:29.031 --> 38:30.196
Yeah.

38:30.198 --> 38:31.996
And the third floor guy... Which is Plu.

38:31.998 --> 38:33.763
- Is all the same guy.
- Yeah. It's all the same guy.

38:33.765 --> 38:40.836
But now it seems to be
getting more physical.

38:40.838 --> 38:43.974
So you think this guy
wants people out of here?

38:43.976 --> 38:46.279
Yes.

38:46.281 --> 38:49.750
I see this guy taking pillows

38:49.752 --> 38:51.654
and putting them over living people's faces

38:51.656 --> 38:54.191
and trying to kill them,

38:54.193 --> 38:56.128
but he's made it look like a heart attack

38:56.130 --> 38:57.230
or things like that.

38:57.232 --> 38:58.800
So he's capable of killing living people?

38:58.802 --> 39:00.801
Yes.

39:00.803 --> 39:02.371
He'll, like, target people he doesn't like,

39:02.373 --> 39:05.311
like drug addicts and homosexuals.

39:08.248 --> 39:10.917
You know, Kathy,
earlier you mentioned to me that you're gay.

39:10.919 --> 39:12.520
Is it okay if we talk about that?

39:12.522 --> 39:14.889
Yes.

39:14.891 --> 39:18.327
Now, is it bothering you that
he might have been targeting you

39:18.329 --> 39:19.329
because of your lifestyle?

39:19.331 --> 39:20.564
Now it is.

39:20.566 --> 39:24.401
I think he was targeting
me not only because of that

39:24.403 --> 39:27.337
but also the fact that I was able to connect

39:27.339 --> 39:28.739
with... with the lady,

39:28.741 --> 39:33.645
and so I'm thinking he's like,
"Not only is she gay,

39:33.647 --> 39:36.744
but she also can communicate
with these other spirits,

39:36.746 --> 39:38.478
and now I'm... I'm threatened."

39:38.480 --> 39:41.113
Dan,
when you said it was getting worse here,

39:41.115 --> 39:42.345
you weren't kidding.

39:48.154 --> 39:49.555
Well, Dan, we know one thing for sure.

39:49.557 --> 39:51.456
Kathy was right. This place is dangerous.

39:51.458 --> 39:52.856
But the big question is,

39:52.858 --> 39:55.460
can you make it safe for your
employees and your guests?

39:55.462 --> 39:57.196
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to my partner, Amy.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.365
The first concern I have

40:01.367 --> 40:06.637
is that I think some of the
activity might get... bad,

40:06.639 --> 40:11.172
and I don't think he's going
to be happy about the fact

40:11.174 --> 40:14.334
that all his cards are on the table.

40:14.336 --> 40:21.669
I am very nervous about
how he's going to react,

40:21.671 --> 40:25.671
so I definitely would suggest
that people not stay here

40:25.673 --> 40:29.109
until it can be dealt with.

40:29.111 --> 40:30.512
I'm certainly shaken.

40:32.478 --> 40:34.476
All right.
So how do we get rid of this [bleep]

40:34.478 --> 40:39.346
It needs to be, like,
a massive hit against him.

40:39.348 --> 40:43.615
I would like there to be a psychic knower

40:43.617 --> 40:46.950
to come with two male mediums,

40:46.952 --> 40:50.517
and they all need to work at the same time.

40:50.519 --> 40:53.419
The psychic knower is
going to be taking care

40:53.421 --> 40:55.187
of the residual that's here,

40:55.189 --> 40:58.187
and the mediums are going to be dealing

40:58.189 --> 41:01.122
with the conscious dead that are here,

41:01.124 --> 41:02.557
and there's a lot.

41:02.559 --> 41:06.228
And I want two badass male mediums,

41:06.230 --> 41:07.896
very aggressive, very strong.

41:07.898 --> 41:08.930
Why?

41:08.932 --> 41:11.595
He'll get intimidated a little

41:11.597 --> 41:13.927
and he needs to be intimidated.

41:13.929 --> 41:16.964
Also, I don't want any other
living people in the building

41:16.966 --> 41:18.732
when they're doing this,

41:18.734 --> 41:20.466
'cause I also feel that
they could be attacked.

41:22.867 --> 41:24.332
All right.

41:24.334 --> 41:26.234
And now, once that's done,
the things will be okay here?

41:26.236 --> 41:30.874
It'll be very quiet, void of everything.

41:30.876 --> 41:33.877
It'll feel very, very, very different.

41:33.879 --> 41:36.011
I'm just... I'm... I'm thinking

41:36.013 --> 41:38.815
that I'm gonna miss this place for a while.

41:38.817 --> 41:41.955
Once this [bleep] out of here,
she'll be safe to come back.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.722
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:43.724 --> 41:45.156
Yes.

41:45.158 --> 41:46.858
Thank you.

41:46.860 --> 41:49.664
So you're gonna take our advice, I assume.

41:49.666 --> 41:50.831
Absolutely.

41:50.833 --> 41:52.331
Can't wait to get rid of him.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.169
It won't be easy removing the dead man

41:55.171 --> 41:57.440
wreaking havoc on this restaurant/hotel,

41:57.442 --> 42:00.042
but I believe if Dan follows my advice,

42:00.044 --> 42:01.910
the evil here will be banished,

42:01.912 --> 42:05.249
keeping Dan and his employees
and guests safe from harm.
