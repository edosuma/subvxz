00:49.634 --> 00:51.368
Okay.

00:51.401 --> 00:52.536
Hi.

01:30.540 --> 01:34.444
Did they fill you in
about why I'm here?

01:38.683 --> 01:42.319
Our readers are very interested
in your story.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.358
You and your situation.

01:50.995 --> 01:52.563
I'm not here for
a biography on you.

01:52.597 --> 01:56.233
Many other papers
have covered that.

01:56.266 --> 01:59.570
I'm not here to find out
what everyone already knows.

02:03.775 --> 02:08.277
How are you doing?

02:08.311 --> 02:10.547
I'm okay.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.650
Am I your first visitor?
Have you talked to your mother

02:12.684 --> 02:14.351
or any other family members?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.788
Alex or Christine maybe?

02:16.821 --> 02:19.991
Why?

02:20.024 --> 02:23.293
Well, Adrian, I imagine it'd get
lonely here, wouldn't it?

02:23.326 --> 02:25.362
You were...

02:25.395 --> 02:28.966
arrested on the 14th
and taken in.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.868
It's been a while, so.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.973
Your trial's coming up.

02:49.921 --> 02:52.255
Adrian, I'm not only here
for my readers.

02:52.289 --> 02:56.694
I'm here for myself.

02:56.728 --> 03:00.598
Watching the news online
at my desk

03:00.631 --> 03:05.970
in my office which is just
blocks away from the mall.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.343
Many of us
are trying to understand.

03:13.376 --> 03:16.748
I haven't been
convicted of anything.

03:16.781 --> 03:21.052
Yes.

03:21.085 --> 03:25.790
But I do know that
on June 14th a Caucasian male

03:25.823 --> 03:28.425
about your height
was seen at Riverside Mall

03:28.458 --> 03:30.928
in the parking lot at 11:23 a.m.

03:30.962 --> 03:33.363
by two separate witnesses.

03:33.396 --> 03:35.666
The man was spotted escorting
two young girls,

03:35.700 --> 03:37.068
thirteen-year-old, Anna Emhoff

03:37.101 --> 03:40.004
and her eleven-year-old sister,
Charlotte Emhoff

03:40.037 --> 03:43.908
into a white minivan.

03:43.941 --> 03:45.610
Both sisters have
not been seen since.

03:45.643 --> 03:49.814
They are declared missing.

03:49.847 --> 03:51.849
They were last seen
at the Colonel's Popcorn Stand

03:51.883 --> 03:54.786
with their parents,
Robert and Avery,

03:54.819 --> 03:56.520
at the front left corner
of the food court

03:56.554 --> 03:59.757
just after 11 a.m.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.726
Mall security cameras
show you were not only

04:01.759 --> 04:03.094
in the food court at 11 a.m.

04:03.127 --> 04:04.929
but you were wearing
the clothes identified

04:04.962 --> 04:10.635
by the two witnesses.

04:10.668 --> 04:17.774
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry, I don't
understand your question.

04:17.809 --> 04:22.546
Look, Adrian,
here's where we're at.

04:22.580 --> 04:27.819
Myself, the public, my readers.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.054
"Adrian Graham graduated
Riverside Catholic High School

04:30.087 --> 04:33.124
with honors, formed the
not-for-profit Adaptability,

04:33.157 --> 04:34.992
a charitable organization
that offers

04:35.026 --> 04:39.096
a variety of health and care
programs for disabled youth.

04:39.130 --> 04:42.099
Spent summers working
at Camp Bon Echo,

04:42.133 --> 04:44.367
graduated with a Bachelor's
in Communications

04:44.401 --> 04:46.571
at University of Toronto,

04:46.604 --> 04:48.471
active in the community
including volunteer work

04:48.505 --> 04:49.941
for boys soccer, girls hockey

04:49.974 --> 04:51.809
and the annual Green Festival.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.510
Comments from friends,
family and the community

04:53.543 --> 04:56.647
only support
these likeable traits."

05:01.986 --> 05:03.855
I have here, uh,
"When interviewing Adrian's

05:03.888 --> 05:05.122
older sister Christine Graham

05:05.156 --> 05:08.593
she had this to say
about her brother,

05:08.626 --> 05:09.660
'Even though he was
my younger brother,

05:09.694 --> 05:13.064
Adrian would walk me home
from school as a kid.

05:13.097 --> 05:16.100
He's patient and he's sweet.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.869
I've never seen him treat
even a stranger

05:17.902 --> 05:21.973
with a speck of hostility
even when they deserved it.'"

05:25.508 --> 05:27.078
Is any of this wrong?

05:29.546 --> 05:31.983
Is there anything I'm missing?

05:40.925 --> 05:44.829
Adrian, could you tell me why?

07:46.817 --> 07:48.753
Encouraging the driver
to come forward

07:48.786 --> 07:50.888
in order for the community
to grieve.

07:50.921 --> 07:53.324
Major Collision Bureau
has begun an investigation

07:53.357 --> 07:55.793
into the accident,
anyone with information

07:55.826 --> 08:00.031
is urged to call police
or Crime Stoppers anonymously.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.034
York Region Police has arrested
24-year-old suspect,

08:03.067 --> 08:05.169
Adrian Graham, thirteen days ago

08:05.202 --> 08:07.938
for the kidnapping
of Anna and Charlotte Emhoff

08:07.972 --> 08:09.774
from Riverside Mall.

08:09.807 --> 08:11.976
Thirteen-year-old Anna
and eleven-year-old Charlotte

08:12.009 --> 08:15.880
were kidnapped at Riverside Mall
on Thursday, June 14th.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.749
Two witnesses had spotted
a Caucasian male,

08:18.783 --> 08:20.985
early to mid-twenties,
escorting the sisters

08:21.018 --> 08:23.120
out of the mall's
food court exit

08:23.154 --> 08:25.790
at approximately 11:20 a.m.

08:25.823 --> 08:27.224
Unsubstantiated reports

08:27.258 --> 08:29.126
have described
the kidnapper's vehicle

08:29.160 --> 08:31.695
to be either
a white or blue minivan.

08:31.729 --> 08:33.998
No make or model
has been confirmed.

08:34.030 --> 08:37.168
Riverside Mall surveillance
video show a Caucasian male

08:37.201 --> 08:39.169
covering his face
from the cameras

08:39.203 --> 08:42.173
while walking the sisters
out of the mall doors.

08:42.206 --> 08:45.109
Following the witness reports
and surveillance footage,

08:45.142 --> 08:48.179
Adrian Graham
was arrested at 5:25 p.m.

08:48.212 --> 08:49.713
from his home in Aurora.

08:49.747 --> 08:51.816
As of this time,
he has been detained

08:51.849 --> 08:53.350
and held for questioning.

08:53.384 --> 08:55.653
Police report
that the subject was spotted

08:55.686 --> 08:57.855
wearing grey pants,
white t-shirt

08:57.888 --> 08:59.857
under a black flannel
pattern button-up

08:59.890 --> 09:01.625
and black running shoes.

09:01.659 --> 09:05.296
Suspect was said to be
between 5'10" and 6',

09:05.329 --> 09:07.865
dark features,
and long black hair.

09:07.898 --> 09:10.067
Graham has been held
for 13 days

09:10.101 --> 09:13.971
and no available evidence has
been disclosed to the public.

09:14.004 --> 09:16.140
Police said in a statement
that they were dedicating

09:16.173 --> 09:19.210
every available resource
to this investigation

09:19.243 --> 09:21.312
as they continue to fear
for the wellbeing

09:21.345 --> 09:23.380
of both Anna
and Charlotte Emhoff.

09:23.414 --> 09:25.683
The Homicide
and Missing Person Unit

09:25.716 --> 09:28.352
is leading the investigation
with additional investigators

09:28.385 --> 09:30.821
being brought in from
other specialty units

09:30.855 --> 09:34.058
including Organized Crime
and Intelligent Services.

09:34.091 --> 09:37.294
The investigation is also
supported by the Special Series,

09:37.328 --> 09:40.397
Emergency Response,
K-9, Air Support

09:40.431 --> 09:42.800
and the Forensic
Identification Units

09:42.833 --> 09:45.035
whose members have been
working around the clock

09:45.069 --> 09:47.238
since Charlotte and Anna
were kidnapped.

09:47.271 --> 09:49.340
So far, police have
not uncovered a motive

09:49.373 --> 09:51.709
for the abduction.

10:00.317 --> 10:02.052
Stop it, sit down.

10:02.086 --> 10:03.087
Sit down.

10:04.088 --> 10:05.322
Sit down.

10:08.292 --> 10:10.928
I'm going to make us some tea,
okay?

11:30.274 --> 11:34.278
Which one do you want?

18:25.455 --> 18:26.824
There he is.

18:26.858 --> 18:30.928
He said that's the giant
on the bed!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.635
There isn't a moment to waste.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.904
Every last man must do
all he can.

18:39.937 --> 18:41.538
Work with the greatest haste!

18:41.572 --> 18:43.675
So bind up its hands,
its arms, its chest,

18:43.708 --> 18:45.877
its neck, its feet.

18:45.910 --> 18:49.413
And I'll do the rest, let's go.

19:13.604 --> 19:16.273
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

19:16.306 --> 19:18.009
Quiet!

19:18.042 --> 19:20.544
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

19:20.578 --> 19:25.549
- Quiet!
- Hm?!

20:40.992 --> 20:44.028
Even if I said something,
you know...

20:46.564 --> 20:48.465
Even if I did...

20:50.400 --> 20:51.535
Just there...

20:53.971 --> 20:56.808
Just right away without
anything, right?

21:00.011 --> 21:01.879
You weren't there.

21:04.048 --> 21:06.449
You couldn't have been.

21:10.588 --> 21:14.025
I was so young
but you say stuff like you were.

21:19.730 --> 21:23.634
Anna was there though like...

21:23.668 --> 21:24.936
between the door peeking through

21:24.969 --> 21:29.841
as if she was a part of it.

21:29.874 --> 21:31.374
Face was like she thought,
you know,

21:31.408 --> 21:34.411
she was the cavalry
or something.

21:34.444 --> 21:36.914
She tried
but couldn't do anything.

21:39.951 --> 21:42.452
Are you kiddin'?

21:45.488 --> 21:47.424
She knew.

21:49.694 --> 21:53.664
She was there between the door
peeking through, you know.

21:57.835 --> 21:59.737
Son just does the same,
just peeks through

21:59.770 --> 22:01.072
like he's the cavalry
or something.

22:01.105 --> 22:04.041
But I know...

22:04.075 --> 22:06.577
I know what's going on.

22:16.020 --> 22:19.023
Took his belt off
like it was something.

22:23.995 --> 22:28.766
He didn't look at it
as he slide it off, it just...

22:28.799 --> 22:31.002
just came off like...

22:34.205 --> 22:35.740
...he'd been doing it for years

22:35.773 --> 22:37.909
but I was the oldest, so.

22:42.113 --> 22:45.448
Had that smile.

22:45.482 --> 22:47.652
He had that smile.

22:50.988 --> 22:54.225
I've done that impression
for you before, the smile.

22:54.258 --> 22:56.761
The smile, the fucking smile
with his lips arched,

22:56.794 --> 22:59.063
his teeth clean.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.803
Never seen his teeth so clean.

23:08.205 --> 23:09.974
It was like he never brushed
until those days

23:10.007 --> 23:12.610
that he knew, that fucking...

23:19.583 --> 23:21.619
You can just burn
those whites in my mind,

23:21.652 --> 23:26.691
you know, forever and all that.

23:26.724 --> 23:28.893
Broke my skin just scrubbing
with a metal brush.

23:28.926 --> 23:32.663
I could still smell him.

23:41.772 --> 23:46.711
You think doing that to
a child would leave something.

23:46.744 --> 23:51.849
Leaves a little, just right
at the back, you know.

23:51.882 --> 23:56.220
That's, you know,
that's what parenting is.

23:56.253 --> 23:58.856
It's leaving a little something
at the back of the mind

23:58.889 --> 24:03.961
and just making sure
it stays there.

24:03.995 --> 24:06.529
Just making sure, right?

27:40.477 --> 27:42.479
How's it going?

27:42.513 --> 27:44.882
You having a good time?

27:44.915 --> 27:47.785
No, just watching a movie.

27:47.818 --> 27:48.886
Is it good?

27:51.088 --> 27:52.790
I don't know.

27:56.994 --> 27:58.796
Is what good?

28:11.242 --> 28:13.544
Is that yours?

28:13.578 --> 28:15.779
Is that bottle yours?

28:19.016 --> 28:20.784
Put your hands down.

28:20.818 --> 28:22.119
Put your fucking hands down

28:22.152 --> 28:23.520
or I'll open that head up.

28:34.832 --> 28:36.233
Okay.

28:38.335 --> 28:41.438
Put that at the front
of your head.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.492
Hello.

29:04.495 --> 29:07.431
Antonio.

29:07.464 --> 29:08.966
Oh-oh.

29:08.999 --> 29:10.834
Well, how are you, darling?

31:00.344 --> 31:03.046
Are you going to eat that?

31:03.080 --> 31:05.349
Yeah, why?

31:05.382 --> 31:07.284
You're going to eat that here?

31:09.153 --> 31:12.089
That's different.

31:12.122 --> 31:15.292
I'd never eat in a petting zoo,
it's disgusting.

31:15.325 --> 31:16.994
I'm sorry,
I completely forgot about him.

31:17.027 --> 31:18.663
I'll move him.

31:25.670 --> 31:27.037
No.

31:29.173 --> 31:30.441
You're right.

31:32.142 --> 31:33.510
I'm wrong.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.649
This isn't our summer home.

31:39.784 --> 31:42.953
This isn't our place
of relaxation.

31:45.055 --> 31:47.024
This is a petting zoo.

31:49.727 --> 31:52.296
The animals eat off the ground.

31:58.703 --> 32:00.237
Go.

32:01.739 --> 32:04.107
Eat your meal, right?

32:11.616 --> 32:13.350
You better hurry
and make this a kitchen

32:13.383 --> 32:16.286
or I'll rip that thing apart.

35:15.298 --> 35:16.901
You alright?

35:24.408 --> 35:26.243
You know you shouldn't, uh,

35:26.276 --> 35:28.445
you shouldn't be standing on
the side of the road here.

35:28.478 --> 35:32.282
There's not enough light for it.

35:35.553 --> 35:36.721
All right, well, uh...

35:36.754 --> 35:39.724
car trouble I'm guessing?

35:39.757 --> 35:42.259
Yeah.

35:42.292 --> 35:46.229
Is it... is it the engine?

35:46.263 --> 35:47.965
- No.
- Well, that's good

35:47.999 --> 35:50.768
'cause I don't know
a whole lot about engines.

35:58.475 --> 36:00.878
Oh, it looks like the tire.

36:00.912 --> 36:04.749
Good, I think I got
a jack just for this model.

36:20.598 --> 36:24.001
All right, well, uh,
could you pop the trunk?

36:24.035 --> 36:25.837
For what?

36:25.870 --> 36:28.840
I don't know, do you got
a spare in the back here?

36:28.873 --> 36:30.808
I don't know.

36:30.842 --> 36:32.643
Well, pop the trunk.

36:45.022 --> 36:47.892
All right, well...

36:47.925 --> 36:49.794
you don't got a spare.

36:55.933 --> 36:57.935
All right, well, listen,
I would, uh...

43:33.731 --> 43:34.965
Hello?

43:36.233 --> 43:37.368
Hi.

43:39.870 --> 43:41.872
Yeah, I can do that.

43:43.340 --> 43:47.111
No, nothing,
I'm just really tired.

43:47.144 --> 43:49.180
It's really hot in here.

43:52.516 --> 43:54.251
That's nice.

43:57.821 --> 44:00.057
Tell them I say hi, okay?

44:06.931 --> 44:08.999
Okay, Mom, I have to go.

44:10.167 --> 44:12.736
Okay, bye. Sorry, no.

44:12.770 --> 44:14.071
Bye.

46:48.292 --> 46:50.160
No, no.

46:50.194 --> 46:53.030
No, no, no, no, no, no!

46:53.063 --> 46:54.064
Let me go!

46:56.100 --> 46:57.935
No, please, no!

49:07.197 --> 49:09.399
Well, that's not fair, right?

49:11.703 --> 49:14.772
You don't have to be
a bitch about it.

49:18.643 --> 49:22.212
You pretend like you have
some kind of authority.

49:28.252 --> 49:30.487
Everyone else,
they understand

49:30.521 --> 49:32.590
and they know
the conditions.

49:34.324 --> 49:36.794
But you have a hard time.

49:40.430 --> 49:43.835
I pay you, right?

49:43.868 --> 49:47.371
Like everyone else,
from the moment you walk

49:47.404 --> 49:50.307
through those doors
to the moment you leave.

49:52.844 --> 49:56.179
This doesn't have to be
a constant discussion.

50:02.352 --> 50:04.388
Marianna, look at me.

50:15.432 --> 50:18.402
I'm not waiting
for the night shift girl.

50:20.705 --> 50:22.172
Mm?

50:25.542 --> 50:27.779
You know the rules.

50:30.147 --> 50:32.482
You've been here long enough.

52:21.491 --> 52:22.760
Yeah?

52:28.666 --> 52:30.233
Hi.

52:33.838 --> 52:35.606
What's wrong?

52:35.640 --> 52:38.542
Nothing, um...

52:38.576 --> 52:43.313
Uh, will we be getting paid by
the end of the day today, or...

52:48.686 --> 52:50.220
We?

52:51.521 --> 52:53.624
Sorry, uh,

52:53.658 --> 52:57.729
will I be getting paid
by the end of the day today?

52:59.664 --> 53:02.700
I have to pay my rent
this weekend.

53:08.072 --> 53:09.473
Well...

53:11.809 --> 53:13.945
...that depends, doesn't it?

53:16.080 --> 53:18.583
It's not up to me, right?

53:21.351 --> 53:22.887
Right?

53:25.455 --> 53:27.290
Right, yeah.

53:28.826 --> 53:29.994
Yeah.

53:30.027 --> 53:31.929
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:49.046 --> 53:50.648
...as investigators found

53:50.681 --> 53:53.651
an abandoned 2013
white Toyota Sienna

53:53.684 --> 53:56.788
18 kilometers
from the Riverside Mall.

53:56.821 --> 53:58.723
The homeowner,
whose name is being withheld

53:58.756 --> 54:00.758
because he is concerned
for his safety,

54:00.792 --> 54:03.928
said he was walking his dog
on Road heading west

54:03.961 --> 54:06.429
when he spotted the vehicle
in a ditch.

54:06.463 --> 54:08.933
Investigators say the vehicle
has no registration,

54:08.966 --> 54:11.702
however the back window
had been kicked in

54:11.736 --> 54:12.770
from the inside out.

54:12.804 --> 54:15.706
No further evidence
has been found at this time.

54:15.740 --> 54:18.009
Adrian Graham has been
the only suspect

54:18.042 --> 54:19.442
in the kidnapping case

54:19.476 --> 54:21.478
since the disappearance
of the sisters.

54:21.511 --> 54:24.048
His story has been
the center of attention

54:24.081 --> 54:26.951
for many media outlets
including last week's

54:26.984 --> 54:30.822
Toronto Star headliner written
by journalist Calvin Shepard.

54:30.855 --> 54:32.723
The line of questioning
that revolves

54:32.757 --> 54:34.357
around Graham's involvement

54:34.391 --> 54:36.894
is his lack of motivation
and his virtuous manner

54:36.928 --> 54:38.896
with friends, family,
and the community.

54:38.930 --> 54:41.065
Many social media users
have been debating

54:41.098 --> 54:43.701
on the participation
and involvement of Graham

54:43.734 --> 54:45.468
in the Emhoff sisters'
kidnapping,

54:45.502 --> 54:49.106
some stating he is being
wrongly accused for lack of e...

59:40.464 --> 59:41.932
Mom?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.002
Good, just got home.

59:46.437 --> 59:48.839
Yeah, yeah, of course.

59:50.274 --> 59:52.343
No, I'm fine. Why?

59:54.145 --> 59:55.679
No, I...

59:58.082 --> 01:00:02.052
I think Sweeney ran away,
I don't know.

01:00:02.086 --> 01:00:04.722
I let him out
and now I can't find him.

01:00:04.755 --> 01:00:07.858
You know, he wouldn't
just do that, right, he...

01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:10.060
he wouldn't just take off.

01:00:13.497 --> 01:00:15.366
Yeah, I hope so.

01:00:19.403 --> 01:00:23.140
Um... are you gonna be home
for dinner?

01:00:25.242 --> 01:00:28.712
No, I will, I was...
I was just thinking

01:00:28.746 --> 01:00:31.248
maybe we could all have
dinner together, you know?

01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:34.718
Terry, too, maybe Al
if she's not busy.

01:00:36.954 --> 01:00:38.889
Yeah, it would be nice.

01:00:42.092 --> 01:00:43.294
Yeah, no.

01:00:43.327 --> 01:00:45.763
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:00:45.796 --> 01:00:47.965
Yeah, I'm gonna go look for him.

01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:50.768
Okay.

01:00:51.835 --> 01:00:53.337
Love you too.

01:00:54.538 --> 01:00:56.140
Bye.

01:06:33.143 --> 01:06:34.612
Oh, shit!

01:06:55.165 --> 01:06:57.334
What's so funny?

01:07:02.239 --> 01:07:06.811
Okay, so that'll be
about $6,233 after taxes,

01:07:06.844 --> 01:07:09.647
but, uh,
if you wanted to do cash,

01:07:09.681 --> 01:07:11.749
I could throw you
around $4,000 right now.

01:07:11.783 --> 01:07:14.752
I think my dad
would be okay with that.

01:07:14.786 --> 01:07:17.120
If I take the cash,
do I have to sign anything?

01:07:17.154 --> 01:07:18.556
Yeah.

01:07:22.326 --> 01:07:24.762
Can you do three
and I just walk?

01:07:26.698 --> 01:07:28.600
Uh...

01:07:28.633 --> 01:07:30.602
yeah, if that's something
you wanted to do.

01:07:30.635 --> 01:07:32.369
We could do that.

01:07:32.402 --> 01:07:33.671
Yeah.

01:07:35.238 --> 01:07:37.174
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:08:19.216 --> 01:08:20.852
All right, there you go, buddy.

01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:23.386
Can I get the keys?

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:26.390
Good luck.

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:33.130
Hi, you've reached Richard Neil.

01:13:33.164 --> 01:13:35.532
Please leave a message
at the beep. Thank you.

01:13:37.902 --> 01:13:39.570
Dad?

01:13:42.173 --> 01:13:43.674
Dad?

01:13:45.609 --> 01:13:47.044
Dad?

01:14:00.191 --> 01:14:02.525
Officers confirmed on Tuesday
that the finding

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.962
of the victim's sweater was made
late in the investigation

01:14:04.996 --> 01:14:07.698
but would not provide
any additional information.

01:14:07.732 --> 01:14:09.600
The suspect, Rebecca Clark,

01:14:09.633 --> 01:14:11.602
turned herself in
to police overnight.

01:14:11.635 --> 01:14:13.838
She has been charged
with forcible confinement,

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.706
assault with a weapon,
and assault.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.708
The accused made
a brief court appearance

01:14:17.742 --> 01:14:19.710
in a Newmarket court on Tuesday

01:14:19.744 --> 01:14:23.080
and has her bail hearing
postponed until Friday.

01:14:23.114 --> 01:14:26.017
New updates in the Emhoff
sisters' kidnapping case.

01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:27.952
Sisters Charlotte
and Anna Emhoff

01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:30.855
were abducted in mid June
from the Riverside Mall.

01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:32.890
After a widespread search
of the area

01:14:32.923 --> 01:14:35.693
where police had found the
abductor's abandoned minivan,

01:14:35.726 --> 01:14:38.996
they retrieved what appears to
be Charlotte Emhoff's backpack,

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:40.865
the same bag
she was said to have

01:14:40.898 --> 01:14:43.100
when both her and her sister
were abducted.

01:14:43.134 --> 01:14:45.102
The bag was found
near the train tracks

01:14:45.136 --> 01:14:47.838
north of 19th and Bayview
in Richmond Hill.

01:14:47.872 --> 01:14:49.907
Investigators say
the bag was located

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.777
approximately 12 kilometers
from the Riverside Mall

01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:55.613
and only 6 kilometers
from the abandoned vehicle.

01:14:55.646 --> 01:14:58.049
Parents Robert and Avery
have not yet confirmed

01:14:58.082 --> 01:14:59.650
the bag to be Charlotte's.

01:14:59.683 --> 01:15:02.253
Authorities have not yet said
what effect, if any,

01:15:02.286 --> 01:15:04.688
these developments will have
on Graham.

01:15:04.722 --> 01:15:06.323
An arrest has been made
in the murder

01:15:06.357 --> 01:15:09.060
of an on-duty police officer
who was gunned down

01:15:09.093 --> 01:15:11.062
at a convenience store
in Aurora.

01:15:11.095 --> 01:15:14.065
Authorities charged
a 21-year-old man Wednesday

01:15:14.098 --> 01:15:16.367
with capital murder
in this week's fatal shooting

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.769
of police officer
Justin Heffernan.

01:15:18.803 --> 01:15:22.106
Heffernan, 43, was attempting
to arrest Anthony Tan

01:15:22.139 --> 01:15:24.208
on multiple felony warrants
Monday

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:26.944
when Tan shot him three times
in the chest.

01:15:26.977 --> 01:15:29.580
Tan, who was injured when he
and Heffernan exchanged...

01:18:10.808 --> 01:18:12.910
You don't fucking know
how I feel!

01:18:14.445 --> 01:18:16.847
Listen, listen, Dad.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.382
No, I'm sick of this shit.

01:18:18.415 --> 01:18:19.883
You understand, you left me.

01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:21.352
You left your own fucking kid!

01:18:27.992 --> 01:18:29.159
No!

01:18:29.193 --> 01:18:34.131
No, I don't want you to
fucking call me anymore, okay?

01:18:34.164 --> 01:18:35.933
No, I know.

01:18:48.012 --> 01:18:50.314
Don't fucking call me anymore!

01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:29.486
News broke earlier this morning

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.623
that Adrian Graham,
the sole suspect

01:19:31.656 --> 01:19:34.391
in the Emhoff sisters'
disappearance in June,

01:19:34.425 --> 01:19:37.061
had been released quietly
yesterday morning.

01:19:37.094 --> 01:19:40.130
Ministry of Community Safety
and Correctional Services

01:19:40.164 --> 01:19:43.334
spokesman Don Taylor said
Adrian Graham was released

01:19:43.367 --> 01:19:47.338
Saturday at 6:40 a.m. from the
Toronto South Detention Centre.

01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:50.174
All charges were dropped
following insufficient evidence

01:19:50.207 --> 01:19:52.644
and the reliability
of a witness testimony.

01:19:52.677 --> 01:19:55.079
It is understood
there have been developments

01:19:55.112 --> 01:19:57.348
with another possible suspect
in the case.

01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:59.883
However, little is known
at this time.

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:01.318
Robert and Avery Emhoff,

01:20:01.352 --> 01:20:03.153
the parents
of the missing sisters,

01:20:03.187 --> 01:20:06.156
have not spoken out regarding
the private release of Graham.

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:09.293
Stay tuned for further updates.

01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:21.271
Is any of this wrong?

01:20:21.305 --> 01:20:23.507
Is there something I'm missing?

01:20:26.143 --> 01:20:28.445
Adrian, can you tell me why?

01:20:32.516 --> 01:20:35.285
How would that help anything?

01:20:35.319 --> 01:20:37.287
I'm confused
by your line of questioning,

01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:40.491
and frankly, it makes me angry.

01:20:40.524 --> 01:20:43.527
What makes you angry?

01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:47.431
I'm being accused
of a very heinous crime.

01:20:47.464 --> 01:20:49.066
Yes.

01:20:52.136 --> 01:20:53.470
You're a journalist.

01:20:53.504 --> 01:20:55.939
You report
what has already been found.

01:20:55.973 --> 01:20:59.443
You further the understanding,
right?

01:20:59.476 --> 01:21:03.046
This is a world
where nothing is solved.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.482
I can grasp that.

01:21:07.251 --> 01:21:08.620
What I don't understand

01:21:08.653 --> 01:21:12.624
is trying to pin a cause
for every effect.

01:21:12.657 --> 01:21:15.392
You know,
there's a victory in saying,

01:21:15.426 --> 01:21:18.095
"I will not understand this,"

01:21:18.128 --> 01:21:21.699
and it's because you're finally
giving in to the reasoning.

01:21:23.568 --> 01:21:26.470
You're trying to name colors.

01:21:26.503 --> 01:21:29.973
Just let them sound
how they look.

01:21:32.176 --> 01:21:33.745
So you have nothing,

01:21:33.778 --> 01:21:36.079
nothing for what happened?

01:21:36.113 --> 01:21:38.048
That's what you're saying?

01:21:40.652 --> 01:21:45.088
I want them to find
whoever did this.

01:21:45.122 --> 01:21:50.461
You think I want to be here
across the desk from you?

01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:52.996
In the news last month,
a mother had murdered

01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:54.632
her husband
at their summer home.

01:21:54.666 --> 01:21:57.134
That very night,
she murdered her son

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.535
as he slept beside her.

01:22:00.137 --> 01:22:01.639
A warehouse worker driving home

01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:04.341
from a late shift last Sunday
blew out her tire.

01:22:04.374 --> 01:22:06.376
When a man pulled over
to help her,

01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:09.179
she stabbed him with a knife.

01:22:09.213 --> 01:22:11.583
A mechanic hits a man
with his car

01:22:11.616 --> 01:22:14.652
and then attempts
to flee the country.

01:22:14.686 --> 01:22:16.654
Things happen.

01:22:16.688 --> 01:22:20.625
Everything that's happened
will happen again and again.

01:22:23.327 --> 01:22:26.196
You need to get comfortable
with that.

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:30.434
They need to get comfortable
with that.

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:34.404
Because you can tell them
what's happening,

01:22:34.438 --> 01:22:37.541
but does that really explain
what's happening?

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:44.081
Because monsters aren't built
in a moment.
