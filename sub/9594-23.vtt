WEBVTT

00:42.176 --> 00:45.846
Perfection.
Thanksgiving style.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.316
Whoa! Thanksgiving!

00:48.349 --> 00:50.418
The best holiday
after Christmas, Halloween,

00:50.451 --> 00:54.122
Valentine's, New Year's
and my birthday. Oh, yeah!

00:54.155 --> 00:56.524
Sweet potatoes
with marshmallows on top.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.159
Classy.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.627
Ooh, I cannot wait!

00:59.660 --> 01:00.828
Dig in!

01:02.130 --> 01:03.664
-Ahhh!

01:03.697 --> 01:05.699
Huh?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.269
There will be no digging
until I say so.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.305
No one can eat until
a very special guest arrives.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.307
Batman!

01:17.478 --> 01:20.548
He trained me to be
a master fighter, detective,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.850
and host of medium-size
holiday gatherings.

01:22.883 --> 01:25.686
That's why everything
needs to be perfect
when he arrives.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.289
The decor, the place settings,
the seating arrangement,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.658
and most importantly,
the food.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! What is that?

01:37.565 --> 01:41.202
My first attempt
at the Thanksgiving
dish of sides, Robin.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.770
It is the Burp-Glurp.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.206
-Some say that its struggles
in one's throat

01:45.239 --> 01:47.308
adds to its deliciousness.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.876
-Sounds tasty. But, no.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.282
I know Bat visits
stress you out,
but just relax.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.883
Think about
what you're thankful for.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.119
-Ooh! He's here!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.325
Hello, hello.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.627
Happy Thanksgiving,
puny mortals.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.595
Trigon.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.498
You are not welcome here,
you evil demon!

02:10.531 --> 02:12.200
You're not
on the seating chart.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.503
Oh, I won't be a bother.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.207
I'm not here as a demon.
I'm here as a dad.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.511
I wanted to make sure
my little lump has
a perfect Turkey Day.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.578
Ugh!

02:24.612 --> 02:26.280
So nice to see you, Dad.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.649
Can't wait to see
how you ruin this holiday.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.785
I promise I will not devour
any souls this year.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.655
Only that succulent bird.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.725
My goodness!
Cooked to perfection.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.427
Yes, it is.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.663
Hmm, I guess we can make room.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.433
I, uh, actually invited
some extra guests too.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.601
-I had to, dude.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.802
It's a homeless family.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.572
Aw. Well, then of course
we can make room.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.906
-Right there.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.409
Ahhh!

02:55.443 --> 02:57.278
You said
it was a homeless family.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.879
Those are filthy rats!

02:58.912 --> 03:01.415
Yeah. A homeless family
of filthy rats.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.317
They're destroying
my perfect turkey.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.860
Thanks a lot, homeless rats.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.562
Thanksgiving is ruined.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.697
I can help out
with a new turkey.

03:16.730 --> 03:21.235
All I need is for the biggest,
strongest, meatiest Titan
to join me in the kitchen.

03:21.269 --> 03:24.538
Oh, oh, that's me! I'm strong,
and you want to talk meaty?

03:24.572 --> 03:26.507
Give this a little pinch.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.442
-Mmm.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.478
You will do nicely.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.847
So, how are we
going to cook this bird?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.750
Deep fry
I'm a grilling man myself.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.018
Got built-in tongs.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.522
I have a secret family recipe.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.956
I want to know the secret.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.594
Well, if you promise
not to tell.

03:46.627 --> 03:50.598
I turn you into a turkey
and cook you,
and we eat you.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.267
That's it.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.307
Come on, come on, where is he?
Gravy's almost ready.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.675
He should be here soon.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.876
Whoa!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
-Yeah.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.414
They loved your cooking
so much,

04:06.447 --> 04:08.516
they invited their entire
extended family,

04:08.549 --> 04:10.851
who are also homeless
and filthy.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.325
There's not enough food
or seats.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.959
They need to leave, right now.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.728
Aw, they won't eat much.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.931
Just enough to fill their
little disgusting rat bellies.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.473
They can stay.
But no more rats.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.875
And don't let them gnaw
on the decorations.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.444
I spent a lot of time on them.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.880
-Behold!

04:39.913 --> 04:42.650
The Thanksgiving rite
of the foot and the ball!

04:42.683 --> 04:44.852
-Scoredown! Ahhh!

04:44.885 --> 04:46.053
CHEERLEADERS: Be aggressive!

04:46.086 --> 04:47.521
-B-E aggressive!

04:47.555 --> 04:49.890
Starfire,
what are you doing?

04:49.923 --> 04:53.861
I am contributing
a traditional
Thanksgiving game.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.896
Punt-off!

05:04.872 --> 05:07.074
Dad, what are you doing?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.410
-Ah, honey, you're here!

05:09.443 --> 05:12.580
Be a dear and help me
chop off your friend's
skinny bird head, okay?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.352
This always happens.

05:18.386 --> 05:22.556
You show up acting all nice,
but then you commit
some unspeakable evil.

05:22.590 --> 05:27.595
Aw, I just wanted
my daughter's Turkey Day
to actually have a turkey.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.564
Oh, so that
makes it okay to eat
one of my friends?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.433
I chose the one
you like least.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.968
-I like Robin the least.
-We can eat him, too.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.743
Dad!

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
-ROBIN: Any minute now.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.114
Decorations in place,
food... Whoa!

05:47.147 --> 05:48.616
What?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.153
Beast Boy!

05:53.186 --> 05:55.489
I told you
not to invite more rats.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.058
-I didn't, dude.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.395
Miracle of life, bro.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.832
Mama rats plus papa rats
make baby rats.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.000
Batman is going to be here
at any moment.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.135
What is he going to think?

06:08.168 --> 06:10.738
Don't you know
he likes bats, not rats!

06:10.771 --> 06:12.640
Bats, not rats!

06:12.673 --> 06:15.509
-Bats! Not rats.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.762
Slippery rascal.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.431
I've got him,
I've got him,
I've got him now.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.600
Get away from my friend.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.543
Thanksgiving needs a turkey.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.048
Fine.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
Just eat Cyborg.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.919
You never listen to me anyway.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.937
All I wanted was for today
to be perfect.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.238
Perfect for who, Dad?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.107
Well, if your
"perfect" Thanksgiving

07:20.140 --> 07:22.242
doesn't include
eating one of your friends,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.844
then so be it.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.978
Thanks, Dad.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.179
Now, change Cyborg back

07:26.213 --> 07:27.681
and let's go
get ready for dinner.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.950
Oh, uh... I can't.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.853
He's stuck as a turkey
until at least Christmas.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.723
Magic.
Pretty crazy, huh?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.733
The decorations are up,
the table is set.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.201
-Perfect!

07:48.235 --> 07:50.604
But, Robin,
where will you sit?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.975
I forgot a seat for me!

07:55.008 --> 07:58.512
Don't worry, brah,
we saved you one
at the kids' table.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.750
The kids' table?
Not the kids' table.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.253
I got to sit here every year.
Rickety table legs that
don't even match my...

08:06.286 --> 08:07.287
Oh!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.590
Let us commence the feast.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.595
No! I said nobody eats
until Batman arrives.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.729
Where is he going to sit?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.998
He's Batman!
He sits where he likes!

08:18.031 --> 08:20.267
Now, while we wait,
everybody just...

08:20.300 --> 08:23.003
Just say what
you're thankful for.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.371
I'll start.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.608
I'm thankful that
I was able to put together
a perfect Thanksgiving.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.209
Even though some people
tried to ruin it.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.081
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm thankful
for my cool new rat friends

08:34.114 --> 08:37.050
who understand the point
of a holiday actually...

08:37.084 --> 08:38.752
Robin.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.054
I'm thankful my dad
turned my friend
into a turkey.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.124
I'm thankful to be here
with my daughter,

08:44.157 --> 08:47.060
even if she doesn't appreciate
my gifts to her.

08:50.097 --> 08:55.102
Well said, my juicy, meaty,
delicious friend.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.807
I can't help myself.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.811
-I need to eat
that robot turkey!

09:07.681 --> 09:09.182
Food fight!

09:12.820 --> 09:15.022
Scoredown!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.126
Take that!

09:22.763 --> 09:24.932
You're all
off the seating chart!

09:54.728 --> 09:57.130
I guess I ruined Thanksgiving
for everyone.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.932
Yes, you did.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.635
But everyone's
terrible actions have
helped me understand

10:01.669 --> 10:03.971
the true meaning
of this celebration.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.373
And that is why I am thankful

10:06.406 --> 10:08.976
that you are
our leader, Robin,

10:09.009 --> 10:10.343
and my friend.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.982
I'm thankful you always
make me feel better
about myself.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
Want to help me
clean up my mess?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.720
What

10:19.753 --> 10:23.156
It is the Christmas miracle
of the Thanksgiving.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.658
Who did this?

10:24.692 --> 10:25.993
It was the rats.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.730
They say that usually
they don't have a place to go

10:29.763 --> 10:32.332
or food, or even a chance
to see their family.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.904
Tonight, though, they had
all that and more.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.141
They think this was
the best Thanksgiving ever.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.177
And to say thanks,
they wanted to give
something back.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.446
A Thanksgiving feast.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.884
Amazing!
But what about the turkey?

10:50.918 --> 10:53.053
Oh, Dad and I
took care of that.
