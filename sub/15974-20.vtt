-- Yeah.

01:10:43.975 --> 01:10:45.443
You spoke to Isaac
this morning?

No, I spoke to Esther.
Isaac couldn't --

01:10:47.746 --> 01:10:50.340

01:10:59.357 --> 01:11:02.019

blame me for any part of this.

It's a shame, J.J., 'cause I want
so much to be attractive to you.

You know, we're going to
have to work together.

01:11:07.165 --> 01:11:08.189
Yes, I know.

01:11:10.668 --> 01:11:12.636
Isaac kept me up to speed.

01:11:12.704 --> 01:11:14.638
And if you want to create the impression
that Isaac's healthier than he is --

01:11:14.706 --> 01:11:16.470
for instance, if you want
to create the impression

01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:18.305
that Isaac's still
in control of the show

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:20.208

even speak on the telephone --

01:11:20.278 --> 01:11:21.712
I can help you there, too.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.249
He wasn't able to come to the phone
when I called this morning, J.J.

01:11:24.315 --> 01:11:25.578
He's able to speak.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.243
He just had a stroke, Dana.

01:11:27.318 --> 01:11:29.013
Where was he,

01:11:29.087 --> 01:11:30.748

-- Excuse me?

01:11:30.822 --> 01:11:32.221

your dog. How's that?

01:11:38.963 --> 01:11:40.021
That's fine.

01:11:40.098 --> 01:11:41.566
Look, you can't run
the organization

01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:43.067
and run the show
at the same time.

01:11:43.134 --> 01:11:44.624
I don't have to run
the organization.

01:11:44.702 --> 01:11:47.103
He can't talk
on the telephone, Dana.

01:11:54.045 --> 01:11:56.104
Right now, today.

01:11:56.181 --> 01:11:58.912
I'm saying, right now, today, give some
of your responsibilities to Sally.

01:11:58.983 --> 01:12:01.577
-- What's wrong with Natalie? --
We have more confidence in Sally.

01:12:01.653 --> 01:12:03.485
-- I have more confidence in Natalie.
-- Be that as it may.

01:12:03.555 --> 01:12:04.784
<i>You want me to run
the organization</i>

01:12:04.856 --> 01:12:06.517
but let the network
make all the decisions?

01:12:06.591 --> 01:12:09.117
-- I want you and I to work together to

01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:10.787
Feel the need
to bring in --

01:12:10.862 --> 01:12:11.920
-- <i>An interim managing editor?</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:12:11.996 --> 01:12:13.088
-- There's no need to do that.
-- I agree.

01:12:13.164 --> 01:12:14.598
That is a bad move.
That is a wrong call.

01:12:14.666 --> 01:12:16.600
And I'll stand in Luther's
office and tell him.

01:12:16.668 --> 01:12:18.432
That's a wrong call.

01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:19.800
Luther could give a damn

01:12:19.871 --> 01:12:21.600
what you think
is a wrong call, Dana.

01:12:21.673 --> 01:12:24.005
He cares what <i>I</i> think
is a wrong call,

01:12:24.075 --> 01:12:25.941
so don't sit there and think
that I need you to like me.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.603
I'm telling you
the way it is.

01:12:31.883 --> 01:12:35.444
This is weird 'cause this is exactly
where our office used to be.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.010
We can continue this
in the conference room.

01:12:37.088 --> 01:12:40.456
So, J.J., yesterday
was interesting.

01:12:40.525 --> 01:12:41.515
How so?

01:12:41.593 --> 01:12:43.118
-- How so?
-- Yes.

01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:45.253
Well, McKinney had 41 points
against the Clippers,

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:47.230
the Diamondbacks won
their fourth in a row...

01:12:47.298 --> 01:12:49.528
And then there was that thing where
somebody tried to blow us up.

01:12:49.601 --> 01:12:51.729
-- <i>Don't</i> take <i>it personally.</i> -- <i>No,
I think I will take it personally.</i>

01:12:51.803 --> 01:12:53.794
The bomb threat was a hoax.

01:12:53.872 --> 01:12:55.738
-- What was it about?
-- Denny Denton.

01:12:55.807 --> 01:12:57.707
-- What <i>about him?</i> -- <i>They
don't iike his radio show.</i>

01:12:57.775 --> 01:12:59.209
I don't like
his radio show, either.

01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:00.711
-- You know what I do?
Change the station. -- What?

01:13:00.778 --> 01:13:02.906
Would that the world were
as enlightened as you, Dan.

01:13:02.981 --> 01:13:04.642
-- Oh, were that it would.
-- Were.

01:13:04.716 --> 01:13:06.309
-- What?
-- Never mind.

01:13:06.384 --> 01:13:08.876
<i>Thank you. When can I see
rough features?</i>

01:13:08.953 --> 01:13:11.388
-- <i>Two hours.</i>
-- <i>Let's go.</i>

01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:15.483
Uh, Dana?

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.086
[Telephone ringing]

01:13:18.162 --> 01:13:20.722
Esther said he's doing
a little better today.

01:13:20.798 --> 01:13:22.766
I'll call in a little bit.

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:24.563
<i>Dan: You all right?</i>

01:13:24.636 --> 01:13:25.728
Yeah.

01:13:25.803 --> 01:13:26.599
With him?

01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:28.332
[Laughs ] Yeah.

01:13:28.406 --> 01:13:29.669
[Telephone ringing]

01:13:29.741 --> 01:13:32.005
So, we're two
likable guys, right?

01:13:32.076 --> 01:13:34.374
-- I <i>think so.</i> -- <i>I think
we're very likable.</i>

01:13:34.445 --> 01:13:37.244
-- <i>I'm liked</i> wherever I <i>go.</i> -- <i>I'm liked
wherever I go and wherever you go.</i>

01:13:37.315 --> 01:13:38.714
We're perfectly likable.

01:13:38.783 --> 01:13:40.080
Yes.

01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:43.485
[Sighs]

01:13:43.554 --> 01:13:45.613
And yet somebody
tried to blow us up.

01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:47.454
That's what I'm saying.

01:13:47.525 --> 01:13:50.051
-- Does this include Seattle? -- Yes.
It does. -- No. It doesn't.

01:13:50.128 --> 01:13:51.618
-- The film from last night?
-- Yes.

01:13:51.696 --> 01:13:53.221
-- Seattle? It does.
-- Yes. It does.

01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:54.424
-- It doesn't.
-- Dave?

01:13:54.499 --> 01:13:56.399
Hey, Betty, Wilma --
is Seattle on the tape?

01:13:56.467 --> 01:13:57.593
[Knocking on glass]

01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:59.068
Excuse me.

01:13:59.137 --> 01:14:00.229
-- Hey.
-- Hi.

01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:02.273
Good news -- Pluto isn't
being demoted as a planet.

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.365
I need to talk to you.
Can we go in the editing room?

01:14:04.442 --> 01:14:05.432
-- Sure.
-- Thanks.

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:07.069
Uh, it was gonna be demoted
as a planet.

01:14:07.145 --> 01:14:08.840
It was gonna receive
minor-planet status,

01:14:08.913 --> 01:14:10.972
but apparently there was
an outpouring of protest.

01:14:11.049 --> 01:14:12.778
Doesn't the whole thing
strike you as funny?

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:15.182
What I'm gonna say might well
seem abrupt and terrible,

01:14:15.253 --> 01:14:17.813
but when I say it, I want you to
remember that the key word --

01:14:17.889 --> 01:14:19.857
the key word --
is "temporarily."

01:14:19.924 --> 01:14:21.949
"Temporarily"
is the key word,

01:14:22.026 --> 01:14:25.826
so there's not gonna be any reason
to be upset or unhappy, okay?

01:14:25.897 --> 01:14:28.730
I think we should
temporarily -- temporarily --

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.268
stop seeing each other.

01:14:32.403 --> 01:14:33.461
Okay.

01:14:33.538 --> 01:14:36.940
-- I'm serious.
-- I know.

01:14:37.008 --> 01:14:39.238
-- I think we should temporarily
stop seeing each other. -- Okay.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.641
-- I'm serious.
-- I know.

01:14:40.712 --> 01:14:42.441
-- Why are you not unhappy?
-- I don't acknowledge it.

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:45.244
-- You don't acknowledge it? -- I don't
recognize the breakup. I'm sorry.

01:14:45.316 --> 01:14:47.284
-- No, you can't not recognize it.
You can't! -- I am. I did.

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:49.047
-- Natalie, this is a very hard
time right now. -- I know.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.610
-- My head is coming apart.
-- I know.

01:14:50.688 --> 01:14:51.746
I need to be able
to get my life in order,

01:14:51.823 --> 01:14:53.985
to say nothing of what's
going on with Isaac.

01:14:54.058 --> 01:14:57.119
I mean, this is a good time to
give Dana everything we've got.

01:14:57.195 --> 01:14:59.186
-- I know. -- We need to
stop seeing each other.

01:14:59.263 --> 01:15:00.958
No.

01:15:01.032 --> 01:15:02.898
Wait.

01:15:02.967 --> 01:15:04.696
I break up with you.

01:15:04.769 --> 01:15:06.430
Hmm, not this time.

01:15:06.504 --> 01:15:08.700
-- No. I gotta go back to work.
-- Natalie, this is unilateral!

01:15:08.773 --> 01:15:11.071
I don't need you to sign off on
this in order for it to be valid!

01:15:11.142 --> 01:15:13.110
Sweetie, if it makes you feel
better to break up with me,

01:15:13.177 --> 01:15:14.667
that's fine, but I don't
break up with you.

01:15:14.746 --> 01:15:16.009
It doesn't work like that!

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.775
It's working like that
right now.

01:15:17.849 --> 01:15:19.510
-- Does or does not the film
contain Seattle? -- Hang on!

01:15:19.584 --> 01:15:22.053
-- It does. -- It does.
-- Apparently, it does.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.384
-- <i>I'm not kidding, Natalie! I'm totally
serious!</i> -- <i>Would you guys like us to step out?</i>

01:15:24.455 --> 01:15:26.822
-- No. Jeremy's trying to break up with
me, but it won't take. -- Natalie!

01:15:26.891 --> 01:15:28.950
Quiet.
Show me Seattle.

01:15:38.603 --> 01:15:39.866
<i>Hey, Dan.</i>

01:15:39.937 --> 01:15:41.530
What do you say, Phil?

01:15:41.606 --> 01:15:42.869
Hey, Dan.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.341
Celia, you're a knockout.

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:47.174
[Knocking to
"Shave and a Haircut" ]

01:15:47.245 --> 01:15:48.406
Hey.

01:15:48.479 --> 01:15:51.414
-- How you doin'? -- Before I
get mad at you, how is Isaac?

01:15:51.482 --> 01:15:53.746
-- His blood pressure's normal.
-- Oh, that's something.

01:15:53.818 --> 01:15:57.015
-- Why are you mad at me? -- Why were
you avoiding me during the bomb scare?

01:15:57.088 --> 01:15:59.113
-- I wasn't avoiding you.
-- You were.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:01.352
We were out on the street for over an hour.
It was a perfectly good bomb scare.

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.417
-- I <i>tried to find you.</i>
-- <i>No, you didn't,</i>

01:16:03.494 --> 01:16:05.428
and every time I tried to
find you, someone would say

01:16:05.496 --> 01:16:08.397
you had just left the place that someone else
had just said you had been right before.

01:16:08.466 --> 01:16:10.696
-- That was a truly spectacular sentence.
-- Danny...

01:16:10.768 --> 01:16:13.430
<i>It was a bomb scare, Rebecca.
I was serpentining.</i>

01:16:13.504 --> 01:16:16.337
I was employing the covert
ordinance tactics that I learned.

01:16:16.407 --> 01:16:18.068
Where did you learn
covert ordinance tactics?

01:16:18.142 --> 01:16:20.110
'Nam.

01:16:20.178 --> 01:16:22.112
-- You're avoiding me.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.409
-- No, you are.
-- I just admitted it.

01:16:23.481 --> 01:16:24.812
-- You are, Danny.
-- I'm <i>saying I</i> am.

01:16:24.882 --> 01:16:25.576
Why are you avoiding me?

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:26.708
-- Why?
-- Yeah.

shot in the dark.

in the backcourt" heave

01:16:33.624 --> 01:16:35.854
as to why I might be
avoiding you.

01:16:35.927 --> 01:16:37.224
'Cause you thought
Steve and I were divorced

01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:38.490
when, in reality,
we're only separated,

01:16:38.563 --> 01:16:40.053
and Steve wants us to go
back into counseling,

01:16:40.131 --> 01:16:41.758
and I'm on the fence about it,
and you hate Steve?

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:44.393
-- That's amazing.
-- Dan --

01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:46.403
That's amazing that you got it
on the first guess like that.

gonna make some money, me and you.

we needed to stop dating.

I will absolutely not stand in the
way of another man's marriage.

01:16:57.315 --> 01:16:59.545
Then what are you
doing here?

01:16:59.617 --> 01:17:01.210
What am I doing here?

01:17:01.285 --> 01:17:02.810
Yes.

01:17:02.887 --> 01:17:04.616
I came to say hi.

01:17:04.689 --> 01:17:06.418
Hi.

01:17:06.491 --> 01:17:09.426

01:17:09.494 --> 01:17:10.893

I know you were looking
for me yesterday,

01:17:13.197 --> 01:17:15.757
but I reaffirm my position
that I'm here for you,

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:17.631
but it'd be wrong
for us to date.

01:17:17.702 --> 01:17:20.069
But it should be noted
that I'm here for you.

01:17:20.138 --> 01:17:21.833
Where?

01:17:21.906 --> 01:17:23.670
Here.

01:17:23.741 --> 01:17:26.904
So your strategy for this
is to be wonderful.

01:17:26.978 --> 01:17:28.309
-- Yes.
-- Listen...

-- <i>You know why?</i>
-- Why?

01:17:30.047 --> 01:17:31.037
It works every time.

-- Hey, Dan.
-- Hey, Stuart.

Sally, I hope this won't disrupt
things too much on the 2:00 AJVI.

01:17:41.159 --> 01:17:42.251
It won't.

01:17:42.326 --> 01:17:44.488
-- It's just for a week or so.
-- I understand.

01:17:44.562 --> 01:17:47.429
-- Just till Isaac gets better.
-- I'm just surprised.

01:17:47.498 --> 01:17:48.988
-- Are you? -- Surprised
that you asked me.

01:17:49.066 --> 01:17:52.331
-- Why? -- I would've thought that
you'd have more confidence in Natalie.

01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:54.633
-- No.
-- I'd have thought you would.

01:17:54.705 --> 01:17:55.672
[Laughs] No.

-- Good news.
-- <i>What?</i>

-- <i>Pluto's</i> still a <i>planet.</i> -- <i>It was
touch-and-go there for</i> a <i>while?</i>

01:18:01.045 --> 01:18:03.173
Don't underestimate Pluto. Pluto
doesn't know the word “quit.“

Natalie, in Isaac's absence,

01:18:04.682 --> 01:18:06.844
I'm gonna have Sally assume
some of my functions

01:18:06.918 --> 01:18:08.909
while I assume
some of Isaac's.

01:18:08.986 --> 01:18:12.479
-- I had a hunch. Thanks for
helping out, Sally. -- Sure.

01:18:12.557 --> 01:18:14.616
-- It's just till Isaac gets back.
-- <i>Right.</i>

01:18:14.692 --> 01:18:17.218
-- And I'm talking about some of my
functions, not a lot, hardly any. -- <i>Right.</i>

01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:18.319
I understand.

01:18:18.396 --> 01:18:19.557
Casey: HEY-

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:22.895
Guys, I'm having Sally take over a
very small number of my functions.

01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:24.366
-- That's fine.
-- Not many functions at all.

01:18:24.435 --> 01:18:25.994
-- Could I say something, please?
-- Sure.

01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.333

have broken up.

-- I <i>put it in writing.</i>
-- <i>That's sweet.</i>

01:18:31.876 --> 01:18:32.809
All right, just so you know,

01:18:32.877 --> 01:18:35.141
-- if I wanted to, right now, I
could ask out other women. -- No.

01:18:35.213 --> 01:18:36.237
-- I could.
-- No.

01:18:36.314 --> 01:18:38.510

go outwith me?

-- I can't. You're seeing Natalie.
-- Why not?

Hang on. I've been handed
some information I've requested

on, basically, what to do in the event
you think the building you're in

01:19:04.842 --> 01:19:06.606
might blow up at any moment.

<i>For instance, it says you should
stay away from unsecured walls</i>

I'm not saying who --

-- Natalie... -- I believe that
your decision-making skills

aren't the best right now.

-- The "unglued" speech.
-- It wasn't a speech.

01:21:32.723 --> 01:21:35.192
It was a talkin to, and we need
to give it to Dana and Natalie.

01:21:35.259 --> 01:21:36.749
I've noticed
they're a little too calm.

-- <i>Frighteningly calm.</i>

I've been thinking the exact same thing.

We can't defuse
the explosives,

01:21:44.034 --> 01:21:46.696

in an unpopulated area.

where it can't hurt anybody.

01:21:49.106 --> 01:21:50.164

Good.

it's what J.J. wanted.

01:22:26.777 --> 01:22:28.745
He made a threat,
and I believed him.

01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:29.974
It's okay.

01:22:30.047 --> 01:22:31.742
This isn't a good time
to fight with the network.

-- What's going on?
-- Well, let's see.

01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:42.586
The building had to be
evacuated last night

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.424
because a group
of God-fearing people

01:22:44.495 --> 01:22:47.556
said they didn't like Denny Dent0n's
impression of the son of God.

01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:49.793
Why? Because Denny Denton
does him with a lisp.

<i>My girlfriend, whom I've
grown quite fond of,</i>

01:22:51.569 --> 01:22:53.162

to her husband,

01:22:53.237 --> 01:22:54.796
but that's just
'cause he treats her bad.

<i>The only thing

that makes him happy
right now is Natalie,

01:22:57.775 --> 01:23:00.142
so he's decided this would be a
good time to get rid of Natalie.

01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:03.511
<i>The network's decided this is a
good time to show Dana who's boss,</i>

01:23:10.588 --> 01:23:12.113

-- I have to say, Danny,

01:23:23.734 --> 01:23:25.361
that in both their cases,

01:23:25.436 --> 01:23:27.461
-- there's considerable evidence
to support that theory. -- Dana...

01:23:27.538 --> 01:23:29.939
We're in charge.
We're women in charge,

01:23:30.007 --> 01:23:31.805

VVell, we're men. We're petrified.
That's what we do.

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.878
<i>We found that giving into
our fears has made us stronger.</i>

01:23:38.949 --> 01:23:40.348
And not just a little
pathetic.

01:23:40.417 --> 01:23:42.317
-- <i>Right, mostly stronger.</i>
-- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:23:42.386 --> 01:23:43.820
So, if you're scared,
if you're sad,

01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:45.583
if you're mad,
you should tell us.

01:23:45.656 --> 01:23:48.489
It's entirely possible we'd be able to say
or do something to make you feel better.

01:23:48.559 --> 01:23:51.028
That's the other thing we do.

01:23:52.263 --> 01:23:53.662
Did you say a lisp?

01:23:53.731 --> 01:23:55.290
Yes.

Jesus with a lisp? -- Yes.

-- I still hate you, you know?
-- Yes.

to blow up the building.
