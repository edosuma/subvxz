00:33.616 --> 00:36.161
You've been at this forever, Dorothy.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.328
It's pointless.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.497
How can you say that, Ada?

00:39.581 --> 00:40.707
[eerie rumble]

00:40.790 --> 00:42.083
Can't you feel him?

00:42.167 --> 00:43.460
He's close now.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.796
You keep on doing the same thing,
but nothing ever happens.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.632
Perhaps if I had some assistance.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.054
[grunting]

00:56.014 --> 00:59.559

01:52.821 --> 01:54.531
I told you it would work.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.618
[Nina] Kinsey! Bode!

03:21.701 --> 03:23.119
Time for lunch!

03:24.829 --> 03:26.164
[music continues]

03:26.247 --> 03:27.874
[fluttering]

03:38.259 --> 03:39.636
[whooshing]

03:40.595 --> 03:41.512
[Kinsey] Ha!

03:41.596 --> 03:42.764
[Bode exhales]

03:42.847 --> 03:45.183
-Beat you again.
-This game is rigged!

03:45.266 --> 03:47.227
It's not like I chose to be a sparrow.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.980
-Although, it does have some advantages.
-[key clicks]

03:51.064 --> 03:53.399
I can always get my bird friends
to poop on your car.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.818
You don't have any bird friends.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.196
-Not yet.
-[chuckles]

03:58.279 --> 04:02.909
So, I think almost all the prep work
for the wedding's finally done, and…

04:03.534 --> 04:06.829
Oh, I wanted to show you guys something.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.831
I never noticed this before.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.544
It fell off the bookshelf
in the winter study.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.129
Isn't it cool?

04:15.880 --> 04:18.800
I think there might be
something magical about it.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.761
You also thought that
about the record player.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.680
And the weird old squirrel figurine.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.765
Okay, okay, fair, but look.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.100
Keyhouse is in it.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.520
Why would someone make a snow globe
with their house in it if it wasn't?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.438
But it doesn't have a keyhole.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.275
Maybe, and just hear me out,

04:35.358 --> 04:37.986
maybe it's just
a very cool antique snow globe.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.908
[utensils clinking on plates]

04:46.661 --> 04:48.162
You hear anything from Tyler?

04:49.122 --> 04:54.210
Well, yesterday, he liked one of my texts,
so we can assume he's still alive.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.173
Well, good.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.425
That's good?

05:01.509 --> 05:04.220
Ah. I guess the bar
is even lower than I thought.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.017
He wanted time on his own.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.227
We have to respect that.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.897
When he's ready,
I'm sure he'll start communicating more.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.277
In the meantime, we just need
to carry on with our own thing.

05:20.778 --> 05:23.031
It's been two months since he left.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.162
I kind of figured he'd be back already.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, but we've been having
a lot of fun of our own, right?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.210
Well, yeah.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.339
And I'd say we're doing pretty great.
I mean, Dodge is gone.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.299
We haven't heard anything from Eden.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.509
Things are finally kind of normal.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.345
Well, except for you.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.638
You're the weirdo.

05:50.058 --> 05:50.892
[chuckles]

05:50.975 --> 05:52.977

[music stops]

06:19.462 --> 06:20.463
[gasps]

06:20.546 --> 06:21.798
Where is it?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
[suspenseful music playing]

06:28.513 --> 06:30.014
[music intensifies]

06:30.098 --> 06:32.183
[roaring]

06:36.229 --> 06:39.273
Oh, so, um, Duncan said Brian's mother

06:39.357 --> 06:42.110
can't be seated within 50 feet
of his great aunt Sharon.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.612
He didn't explain.

06:45.571 --> 06:50.701
Okay, I'll switch her out with one
of Duncan's Fish-Head College friends.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.120
Great.

06:53.996 --> 06:58.084
I think everything else looks good
unless you spot any other powder kegs.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.504
[Kinsey] The wedding's Saturday.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.590
I think it's safe
to give his seat to someone else.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.594
What about Cousin Frank from Phoenix?

07:08.678 --> 07:12.598
I don't think I can handle that many
knock-knock jokes in one evening.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.852
-They're a family tradition.
-Your dad's side of the family.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.522
Maybe you could ask someone.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.648
Me? No.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.525
You're entitled to a plus-one.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.402
Why don't you ask Josh?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.988
Oh. Um…

07:28.531 --> 07:30.158
I… I don't think I'm ready.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.535
Jamie's already gonna be there
hanging out with Bode.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.247
I think it would actually be nice
if you asked him.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.210
[chuckles softly] I'll think about it.

07:53.973 --> 07:54.891
[camera clicking]

07:54.974 --> 07:56.976
[pleasant music playing]

08:25.004 --> 08:27.006
[adventurous music playing]

08:27.089 --> 08:28.591
[seagulls cawing]

08:33.221 --> 08:34.472
Feel good to be back?

08:34.972 --> 08:38.351
Nebraska's nice, but what can I say?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.187
I'm a man of the sea.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.773
[music continues]

08:47.360 --> 08:48.444
[doorbell rings]

08:48.528 --> 08:49.779
[door opens]

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
[sighs] Ellie!

08:54.951 --> 08:56.244
-[chuckles]
-[Ellie sighs]

08:58.454 --> 09:01.040
You're probably wondering where I've been.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.669
Oh, you don't have to explain.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.050
Do you feel any different?

09:13.594 --> 09:15.221
Not knowing about magic,

09:15.846 --> 09:18.182
having that separate me from my kids

09:19.308 --> 09:20.393
was hard.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.229
Now we can connect.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.149
I know what they've been through

09:27.900 --> 09:31.862
and what you and Rendell
and your friends went through.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.657
So then, you know my part.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.286
Bringing back Lucas
is what started it all.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.455
Oh, you had no way of knowing
what would happen.

09:41.956 --> 09:46.252
Besides, I think the keys
work on you unconsciously.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.713
They wanna be used.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.799
Good, bad, they don't care.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.098
I'm incredibly sorry
about what happened to you.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.684
I know the kids feel horrible.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.936
It's not on them.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.065
It was all Dodge. It's not their fault.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.110
Have you heard from Lucas?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.572
I don't expect to.
He needed to get out of here.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.074
Start fresh someplace else.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.827
Can't say I blame him.

10:19.910 --> 10:22.622
Honestly, I wanted
to start someplace else too.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.752
But Rufus, he had his heart set
on coming back here, so…

10:28.794 --> 10:32.048
[inhales sharply] …we're renting
a little place down by the water.

10:33.799 --> 10:38.012
I couldn't bring myself
to move back into the old house.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.890
Sure, that makes sense.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.268
I'm expecting
a lot of looks and questions.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.106
Apparently, everyone thinks I was found
wandering outside of Pittsburgh

10:49.190 --> 10:51.442
and that I couldn't even
remember my own name.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.363
Better than the truth.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.323
Ellie.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.868
What was it like?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.330
That other place.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.832
[solemn music playing]

11:08.250 --> 11:09.210
It was

11:10.544 --> 11:14.215
like time and space
didn't even exist over there.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.468
And I was just…

11:19.220 --> 11:20.680
drifting in…

11:21.681 --> 11:25.267
It's kind of like
trying to remember a bad dream where

11:25.351 --> 11:28.521
all that's left of it after
is that feeling.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.856
And it's, um…

11:31.982 --> 11:34.402
it's a feeling
that I hope I never have again.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.362
[music continues]

11:46.247 --> 11:48.249
[indistinct chatter]

11:51.419 --> 11:54.964
[Gordie] This film,
it's exactly what I was hoping for.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.882
It's gonna be just what Matheson needs

11:56.966 --> 12:01.929
to get our tourism revenue back on track
after the effect of recent tragedies.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.639
[Zadie] I hope so, Mr. Shaw.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.225
We are just so happy
that you hired us to do it.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.269
I can hear the plummy voice
of the narrator.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.812
"Matheson Massachusetts,

12:09.895 --> 12:13.149
home of revolutionary history,
stunning cliffs,

12:13.232 --> 12:14.817
rich New England clam chowder--"

12:14.900 --> 12:16.569
And the occasional mass fatality.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.487
Doug.

12:19.155 --> 12:19.989
[mouthing] No.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.991
Seriously. I mean,
maybe we should lean into that.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.827
We… We could use this film to…
to really target the dark tourism crowd.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.036
And how about this.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.540
Matheson Massachusetts.
Home of unexplained massacres.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.252
You should check out
the tourism numbers at Chernobyl.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.213
-He's joking.
-[Gordie] Oh.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.758
[laughs] Chernobyl, yeah. That…

12:38.841 --> 12:40.885
-Funny. Yeah.
-…is funny.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.386
Ooh. I better run.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.804
-[grunts]
-Oh.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.347
Keep up the good work here.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.850
Got it. Will do. Thank you.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.563
Yeah. Are you trying to torpedo our one
good source of funding and equipment?

12:52.646 --> 12:55.065
I'm just trying to make this balancing act
a little bit easier.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.651
[Zadie] And action.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.781
And Abby.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.533
Great. Great.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.411
Keep it coming.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.704
Perfect.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.040
Okay. Now you sense him.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.376
-And turn!
-[gasps]

13:17.630 --> 13:18.714
[Zadie] And cut!

13:18.798 --> 13:19.673
Ahh! [laughs]

13:19.757 --> 13:21.258
Guys, that was beautiful.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.346
We just got B-roll for the tourism film
and a Splattering pick-up

13:25.429 --> 13:26.555
all on the same day.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.681
-Boom.
-[Zadie] Boom.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.935
And Bode found this new key
that turns you into an animal.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.064
-Did you and your friends use that one?
-A couple times, yeah.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.774
You did? What animal were you?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.652
Uh, I think I was an owl.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.905
That's so cool.
So, did you just fly around Keyhouse and--

13:42.988 --> 13:45.199
Um, sorry, Ruf.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.036
I'd just rather not talk about it,
if that's okay?

13:50.538 --> 13:51.705
That's fine.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.792
So, what do you say we split the meatloaf?

13:56.293 --> 13:59.046
[sighing loudly] Can I get you something?

13:59.129 --> 14:00.297
Oh my goodness.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.551
-Ellie Whedon?
-Hi, Margie.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.552
Oh. [chuckles]

14:06.303 --> 14:08.180
I'm so happy that you're back!

14:08.264 --> 14:11.225
We were all so relieved when we heard
the news that you'd been found.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.103
That's very kind. Thank you. [chuckles]

14:14.645 --> 14:18.274
So we will start
with two vanilla milkshakes, please.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.902
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right back with those.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.117
[sighs]

14:28.200 --> 14:30.536
I know this isn't easy for you, Mom,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.164
but I think it's good we came back.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.585
I want you to be happy.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.795
You can be happy here too.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.298
If you try. I think.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.049
Will you try?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.219
Yeah.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.138
Okay.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.308
[crickets chirping]

14:52.391 --> 14:55.477
I've got to remember
to call the caterers tomorrow

14:55.561 --> 14:58.147
and update the number of vegetarian meals.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.816
[indistinct whispering]

15:03.235 --> 15:05.237
[suspenseful music playing]

15:13.579 --> 15:15.581
[whispering continues]

15:19.501 --> 15:21.003
[Nina] What do you need, bud?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.341
[whispering continues]

15:29.178 --> 15:31.597
[whispering continues]

15:31.680 --> 15:35.267
Oh, hey, no, no snacks right now.
We're in the dinner zone.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.685
-I just need to--
-Shh!

15:37.811 --> 15:39.438

15:39.521 --> 15:41.649
[gasps] Wait. Are you…

15:43.025 --> 15:44.818
Do you hear something whispering?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.404
[whispering gets louder]

15:47.988 --> 15:49.448
[Bode] I think it's in here.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.872
Okay, uh, let's… Uh, let's…

15:56.956 --> 15:59.583
let's just keep things
somewhat orderly while we--

16:00.501 --> 16:02.586
I think it's hidden in here somewhere.

[whispering intensifies]

16:23.983 --> 16:25.567

Where else is there a snowflake?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.656
[chuckles softly]

16:30.739 --> 16:33.701

16:47.715 --> 16:49.633
I told you it was magic.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.261
Should we try it?

16:52.970 --> 16:54.930
We should probably wait for Kinsey.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.557
Yeah, okay.

16:57.141 --> 17:02.312
[inhales] You're right. Though she did say
she might not be back until late.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.237
All right, I guess we could try.
But only for a second.

Wait a minute. Get your hands off me.
You can't just-- [grunts]

-[in demonic voice] Now give us the key.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.348
No, don't try and take it. It'll…

19:03.517 --> 19:04.434
burn you?

19:04.518 --> 19:05.936
I knew it.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.439
I could tell she's not a Locke by blood.

we're profiling the aquarium,

as Nephropidae's new lair.

This is all my fault. [sobs]

No, Mom, you can't blame yourself.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.405
He's my little boy.
He could be freezing to death in there.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.699
We're gonna find those women
and get back that key.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.201
Do you think they were demons?

21:26.285 --> 21:30.580
They talked about how they'd get burned
if they took a key from a Locke?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
They were unnaturally strong.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.129
We're gonna need to arm ourselves.
Come on.

-Many.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.515
There's one
that can turn you into a ghost,

26:40.599 --> 26:43.351
and one that gives you power
over any sort of plant,

26:43.435 --> 26:46.771
and another one that can bring
a simple drawing to wicked life.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.106
Go get them.

All of them.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.861
Well, being what we are,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.031
we can't just take them from the Lockes.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.241
I don't care how you do it.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.702
Just bring me the keys.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.874
Just give us the key.

We'll give you your Snow Globe Key
so you can rescue your boy,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.644
you'd need to know our names,
wouldn't you?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.483
We're not giving you our keys.
