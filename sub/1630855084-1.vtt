WEBVTT

00:50.967 --> 00:55.263
Any last words?

00:55.972 --> 00:58.516
It's morphin' time! Triceratops!

01:04.272 --> 01:07.776
Putties, grind him into blue dust.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.090
Why'd you lead me here?

01:30.090 --> 01:34.302
Was your grand plan just to die outside
in the fresh sea breeze?

01:37.806 --> 01:40.266
Oh, you brought friends.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.976
Now it's a reunion.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.146
Got your distress call
and zipped here as fast as we could.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.399
Thanks, Zack.
Man, that's Rita Repulsa?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.443
The robot look is not for her.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.654
She'll look better on a junk heap.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.405
Destroy them all!

02:12.215 --> 02:14.884
<i>♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪</i>

02:17.345 --> 02:20.181
<i>♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪</i>

02:22.350 --> 02:24.894
<i>♪ Go, go, Power Rangers ♪</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:28.606
<i>♪ You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ♪</i>

02:31.109 --> 02:33.945
Oh! My face!

02:34.779 --> 02:36.447
I was having fun.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.825
But you wanna get serious?

02:38.825 --> 02:42.328
Come on, let's get deadly serious.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.918
You know, I loved that face.

02:48.918 --> 02:53.047
Just like I love all the power
in my new robot body.

02:53.047 --> 02:58.178
But I'll gladly give up some
of that energy for a spell that kills.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.516
Billy!

03:09.105 --> 03:10.106
Trini!

03:10.899 --> 03:13.401
No!

03:21.701 --> 03:23.870
Goodbye, Trini Kwan.

03:23.870 --> 03:29.167
If anyone needs me, I'll be
in the Dark Dimension planning my revenge.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.104
So what are we gonna tell her?
Maybe their mom drowned?

03:50.104 --> 03:52.857
No. No, Minh's too smart for that.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.612
Well, we gotta decide something quick
because school is out.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.906
The others might need help
searching the Dark Dimension.

03:59.906 --> 04:03.618
You can't decide quick on how to tell
someone the worst news of their life.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.914
And we can't lie to her.
It's gotta be the truth.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.750
- Look, Zordon's rules--
- Zack!

04:11.334 --> 04:13.294
Rules can be broken for a good reason.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.716
Look, if Zordon was back like I had hoped,
I'm sure he'd say that Minh needs to know.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.011
It's always just been her and Trini.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.597
She doesn't have anybody else.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.308
Who's gonna take care of her now?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.812
Our team, we've never had to deal with
something like this before.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.398
No, we have to tell her the truth.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.192
- Otherwise, how's she gonna get closure?
- Billy! She's a kid!

04:36.192 --> 04:39.821
She's a kid, Billy. She doesn't need
to know that we're Power Rangers.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.782
She needs to know
that Rita Repulsa killed her mom.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.714
We have to tell her everything.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.010
Hey. You all good?

05:44.010 --> 05:48.389
Sorry, Uncle Zack.
Time flies when I'm getting my sweat on.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.307
Okay.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.353
We're meant to leave
for the cemetery in ten minutes.

05:53.353 --> 05:58.149
You should clean up, get ready.
We don't wanna keep the others waiting.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.570
I know.

06:03.529 --> 06:07.116
Hey, you think they've made any headway
finding Robo Rita?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.036
- We can ask 'em when we see them.
- Okay.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.122
Wait. One more thing.
Did you get the flowers?

06:13.873 --> 06:14.832
Flowers?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.299
- Thanks. I'll go take a quick shower...
- Yes.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.676
...order you
a "World's Best Guardian" trophy...

06:25.676 --> 06:27.303
- Yes.
- ...then we can leave.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.221
Yes.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.352
You know, Billy always gives me
a hard time whenever we're late.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.524
Guess you can't use, "But I'm
a busy congressman," as an excuse anymore.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.861
Sorry to mess you around.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.449
Today's not a day
I've been counting down to, you know?

06:48.449 --> 06:49.367
Yeah.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.204
Can't believe it's been a whole year.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.666
I know. Seems like yesterday.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.544
Dragonzord!
Pterodactyl!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.921
Triceratops!
Tyrannosaurus!

07:01.921 --> 07:03.714
- Is it me, or did that--?
- Come on.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.179
Before we begin, I just want to say,

07:10.179 --> 07:13.099
unhappy anniversary, Rangers.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.726
- That's Robo Rita, isn't it?
- An ambush.

07:15.726 --> 07:20.231
How predictable of you all
to get together on this special day.

07:20.231 --> 07:24.527
And I've been so busy preparing.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.156
I even reforged some of my old minions.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.075
Snizzard and Minotaur.

07:31.075 --> 07:36.539
Rows and rows of human graves.
This place is beautiful.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.876
Soon, all of Earth will be like this.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.254
Good. We'll start with the Rangers.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.922
Not if we end you first.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.384
I gotta help my team.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.219
But I need you to stay safe, okay?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.013
But she's the one who...

07:53.014 --> 07:55.224
We gotta take her down.
I've been training for--

07:55.224 --> 07:59.270
Hard no. World's Best Guardian says,
"Do not move."

08:07.111 --> 08:09.864
Zack is back... in black.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.787
What? No "sorry I'm late"?
You'll both be sorry.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.624
None of them even complimented
my fancy new machine.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.293
- Snizzard, it's ready.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.212
Nice moves.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.173
- But mine are better.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.933
- What the--?
- Jace!

08:36.933 --> 08:40.645
A wonderful start to my collection.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.356
Time to finish you.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.566
Get her! Get her!

08:46.400 --> 08:48.653
You're the one who's finished.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.738
- Show him, Snizzard.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.741
Gotcha!

08:54.534 --> 08:57.954
You think you can do better
against my new powers?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.123
No chance, Pinky.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.004
Like fish in a barrel. Bring them to me.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.800
Your friends are finished.
We'll see.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.135
It's all coming together.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.098
Hey, what kinda sick game is this?

09:17.098 --> 09:22.019
Oh, it's quite fun.
My machine is draining their energy.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.606
Soon, they'll be lifeless husks.
You can join them.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.034
- Zack! Billy!
We can't win here!

09:37.034 --> 09:38.077
Power down.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.830
Minh, car, now!

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
Come on, come on.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.879
You think you can just drive away?

09:48.879 --> 09:50.256
Cowards!

09:58.472 --> 10:00.016
End of the line.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.313
Road's closed. Your move.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.106
- Go!
Go, go, go.

10:09.525 --> 10:10.776
Huh?

10:12.862 --> 10:16.157
Well-played, Cranston.
Fly while you can.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.660
Soon, every Power Ranger
will be where I want them.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.495
Much like your Trini.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.885
It all happened so fast.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.221
That machine that Robo Rita's building,
what does it do?

10:39.221 --> 10:43.351
Honestly? Something that uses our power
made by Rita Repulsa?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.936
That's a bad mix.
And if we don't put a stop to it,

10:46.437 --> 10:48.898
I... I don't think they're gonna make it.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.566
Then we gotta destroy her.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.320
-"We"?
- Yeah.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.616
This is Ranger business, not "teenage girl
that has homework due" business, okay?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.410
Wh-- She killed Mom.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.537
This is personal.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.374
You know how hard--

11:06.374 --> 11:08.793
- What you don't understand is--
- Let me finish!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.754
If Mom could do it, so can I.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.548
This is her legacy.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.133
I can help.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.220
Minh, I'm really sorry, but you can't.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.721
You're not a Ranger.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.557
Those monsters would overpower you
in a second.

11:23.557 --> 11:27.019
And we can't risk losing you too.
Look, the best thing that you can do

11:27.019 --> 11:30.398
for everyone is to stay out of trouble
and let us sort this out.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.025
Says the guy who caused all this.

11:33.776 --> 11:38.322
We all know that if it wasn't for you,
my mom would still be here.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.535
Oh.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.870
That stung, huh?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.207
Good.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.799
Let's get to Cranston Tech.
It has the scanners we need.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.717
Let's go.

12:03.389 --> 12:08.477
Drip by drip,
their delicious Ranger powers ebb away.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.856
Let's see how much I've stolen from them.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.739
How disappointing.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.741
This process is too slow.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.827
We need as many Rangers as we can get.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.038
I can round the lambs up for slaughter.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.541
Not unless we can find them.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.837
If we can get them to morph,
then it'll be my time to shine.

12:34.837 --> 12:39.842
Good thing I know
exactly what draws out a Power Ranger.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.640
No T-Rex, no Pterodactyl,
no Green Dragon Power.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.225
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.062
We'll have to scan for something else
if we want to find our friends.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.230
Thanks, Alpha 9.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.024
Oh, greetings, Zack.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.693
If the people upstairs only knew
they had the world's smartest robot

12:57.693 --> 12:58.778
right beneath their feet.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.573
Still such a charmer.
It's good to see you again.

13:03.073 --> 13:03.908
Been a while.

13:04.658 --> 13:08.329
I guess life is busy when you're
raising a teenager with attitude.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.998
Oh, Minh definitely has attitude.
Right, Billy?

13:12.708 --> 13:13.584
You all good?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.964
Yeah. It's just,
we haven't been in a mess like this since...

13:21.801 --> 13:22.676
Minh's right.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.180
It really is all my fault
that we lost Trini.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.849
Come on, man.
You were trying to do something good.

13:30.017 --> 13:30.851
Yeah.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.770
And look what happened.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.818
Finally, a hit.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.071
Our system is picking up
a powerful presence.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.741
Really? Maybe it's him
or remnants of him from the Z-Wave.

13:46.325 --> 13:49.495
Alpha 8, we've got to converge
the particles and draw them in.

13:49.495 --> 13:53.541
Initializing Z-Wave energy reconstitution.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.627
It's working!

13:56.627 --> 13:59.213
Zordon! Zordon, are you here?

14:02.132 --> 14:06.720
- Ah, Billy, I don't think that's Zordon.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.439
Malfunction. Billy.
- Alpha!

14:17.439 --> 14:18.983
You have to...

14:19.733 --> 14:21.777
What's happening?
- Get back!

14:24.280 --> 14:27.616
No, no, no!

14:27.616 --> 14:30.077
Yes!

14:30.077 --> 14:33.914
After all these years, I'm free!

14:34.456 --> 14:36.792
It's time for revenge.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.377
No.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.838
No, it... it can't be.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.090
Fact-check, Billy.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.551
You were looking for your precious Zordon,

14:45.551 --> 14:48.512
but when he sacrificed himself
with the Z-Wave,

14:48.512 --> 14:54.310
it wasn't just <i>his</i> particles
that spread across the universe. Get it?

14:54.310 --> 14:59.690
The evil was purged from my being,
and the waves scattered it across space.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.527
Until today,
when you put me back together,

15:03.527 --> 15:06.155
and I found a new body.

15:07.031 --> 15:11.827
Now, Rita Repulsa will reign again.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.707
I need backup at the Command Center.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.917
It's Rita.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.795
- I'll try to lure her outside, but hurry!

15:21.795 --> 15:24.798
Oh, my poor predecessor.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.383
Look, let's focus on the now.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.802
Robo Rita's a force to be reckoned with.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.513
And we gotta make sure
she doesn't hurt anybody else.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.975
My monster scan has found something.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.644
Looks like a live video feed.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.605
It's not Rita. It's Putties.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.567
And it's not just Angel Grove.
It's all over the world!

15:43.567 --> 15:46.111
We knew she would return.
We're prepared for this.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.948
- Alpha 9, it's time.
- Yes, sir.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.202
- Attention all Power Ranger teams.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.371
Bandora Protocol initiated.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.248
Get to your assigned stations now.

15:58.248 --> 16:03.170
If I remember the plan correctly,
visitors in three, two, one.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.050
One minute, I'm helping out
at JJ's junior karate camp,

16:08.050 --> 16:11.804
and the next, I'm sneaking off
to the bathroom to teleport. Seriously?

16:13.430 --> 16:14.890
Bandora Protocol's happening.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.850
Robo Rita's back?

16:18.352 --> 16:22.898
Come on, guys.
Is this really another training exercise?

16:22.898 --> 16:26.694
Because, hello, I just heated my lunch.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.029
It's not training. Rita is back.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.407
- So Tommy, Jason, Kim are fighting her?
- No.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.327
Unfortunately, they've been captured.

16:35.911 --> 16:36.996
So we need your help.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.586
"Not a Ranger"? "Not yet," you mean!

16:49.216 --> 16:51.260
You'll pay for what you did, Rita.

16:59.184 --> 17:03.022
<i>Monsters known as Putty Patrollers
haven't been seen in Angel Grove</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:05.190
<i>for many years, but today, they're back.</i>

17:06.483 --> 17:08.902
<i>Citizens, keep your eyes open
for attackers.</i>

17:08.902 --> 17:12.072
<i>Reports say this is happening
all over the world.</i>

17:12.072 --> 17:14.616
<i>Power Rangers, we need you
today more than ev--</i>

17:32.217 --> 17:34.011
It sounds like you barely got away.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.514
And now we have an army of Putties
on our hands. What's next?

17:37.514 --> 17:40.684
It's likely we'll find ourselves
in a Megazord situation soon.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.354
Billy and I took months
getting the Sabertooth Tiger Zord working

17:44.354 --> 17:45.898
without a Yellow Ranger.

17:45.898 --> 17:50.652
So Dino Megazord is off the table then
without Jace and Kim?

17:50.652 --> 17:51.570
Not quite.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.865
Alpha and I have been experimenting
with secondary connections of the grid.

17:54.865 --> 17:58.535
We made these Proxy Power Coins
as a contingency.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.288
Now all of you can use Dino powers.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.373
Whoa. Zordon was very clear.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.794
Duplicating active powers
is very dangerous.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.506
I don't care how dangerous
too much pink energy is. Once a Ranger...

18:11.673 --> 18:13.133
Always a Ranger.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.135
You can definitely count us in.

18:15.886 --> 18:19.348
All right. First up, there's been
injuries reported already in Angel Grove.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.642
We cannot let the Putties
run rampant any longer.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.268
If that's the case,

18:24.561 --> 18:25.604
it's morphin' time!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.648
Mastodon!

18:27.648 --> 18:28.941
Pterodactyl!

18:28.941 --> 18:30.234
Triceratops!

18:30.234 --> 18:31.652
Tyrannosaurus!

18:33.570 --> 18:35.656
I never get tired of that.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.534
Now, go, go, Power Rangers!

18:41.036 --> 18:43.914
Run!

18:46.834 --> 18:47.751
Help!

18:49.795 --> 18:50.629
Hey!

18:54.049 --> 18:56.301
You Putties want a fight? You found one.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.972
All these years,
and they still sound like angry turkeys.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.182
Then let's carve 'em up.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.941
Finally, my Ranger tracker has got a hit.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.986
So somebody's morphed, have they?

19:14.653 --> 19:17.781
Are we surprised my Putty bait worked?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.868
There's a reason I'm in charge, you fools.

19:20.868 --> 19:25.539
Go to the grid fluctuation coordinates
and get the Rangers.

19:25.539 --> 19:30.169
My masterpiece has a thirst for power,
and those do-gooders will quench it.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.004
Yes, my queen.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.804
Wait, didn't we get Red and Pink?

19:40.804 --> 19:43.140
Different Red.
Different Pink.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.349
Same powers.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.605
Careful of Snizzard, Rocky.
Don't get grabbed.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.690
Noted.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.653
We'll get you out of here, everybody.
Stay calm.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.077
Back off!

20:07.456 --> 20:08.624
Come on. Run.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.334
Everyone, follow me.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.211
This way.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.172
Well, look what we have here.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.674
Something to sink my fangs into.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.177
Huh? [grunts] That's not good.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.345
Sweet dreams.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.979
Curses.
Nice rotation on that kick.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.273
- You've still got it.
- I never lost it.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.943
Time to move.
The civilians here are safe.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.486
On to the next fight.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.445
Ha!

20:39.738 --> 20:42.991
They slithered away.
- Who cares?

20:42.991 --> 20:46.119
As long as they're morphed,
I can track them.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.332
<i>- Seems they went to the park.
- A nice place to grab a bite.</i>

20:50.332 --> 20:51.625
Oh no.

20:51.625 --> 20:55.420
The team's about to find themselves
in a monster sandwich.

20:58.131 --> 21:02.052
<i>This is a worldwide alert
to all Power Rangers.</i>

21:02.052 --> 21:03.637
<i>Minotaur is tracking you.</i>

21:04.137 --> 21:06.682
<i>As long as you're morphed,
he can find you.</i>

21:06.682 --> 21:08.392
<i>You must power down.</i>

21:09.810 --> 21:11.019
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

21:11.019 --> 21:13.897
<i>- Power down, or he'll find you.</i>
- Got it.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.024
Good work, Alpha.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.443
You all heard that, right?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.654
Minotaur's tracking us,
which means--

21:21.822 --> 21:23.615
- Yep.
They followed us here.

21:23.615 --> 21:28.412
- Ruin them, Snizzard.
- My pleasure.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.454
Power down.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.085
Untrackable!

21:37.170 --> 21:39.089
Rangers, look, look.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.717
My new scans picked up activity

21:41.717 --> 21:44.928
in a concentrated spot
on the lunar surface.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.847
Rita's Moon Palace.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.557
If she's making herself at home,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.143
then our friends
and Rita's machine must be there too.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.894
What's that?

21:52.894 --> 21:54.730
It's an incoming call.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.317
<i>We got the Protocol alert.</i>

21:58.317 --> 22:00.986
<i>Our ship is zooming to you
from the Sirius System.</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:03.905
<i>I'm afraid it'll be six hours
before we reach your side of the galaxy.</i>

22:03.905 --> 22:05.407
<i>Then we'll be in teleport range.</i>

22:05.991 --> 22:08.618
<i>Unfortunately, Robo Rita's timing
is the worst.</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:09.870
It always is.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.706
<i>So she got Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy.</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:15.959
<i>It's rough, especially for you, Kat.</i>

22:15.959 --> 22:17.919
I'm not gonna tell JJ
what happened to his father

22:17.919 --> 22:19.296
'cause he'll be home soon.

22:19.296 --> 22:23.175
We're going to get Tommy--
All of them back today.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.594
<i>Right, you've got this.</i>

22:25.594 --> 22:29.056
<i>Oh, and Billy,
that stealth tech you designed for us,</i>

22:29.056 --> 22:31.391
<i>it's a game changer. Thank you.</i>

22:31.391 --> 22:32.517
You're very welcome.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.270
<i>Being invisible has definitely helped
our team's run-ins</i>

22:35.270 --> 22:36.855
<i>with the Troobian Empire.</i>

22:36.855 --> 22:38.440
Safe travels. Okay?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.400
<i>Thanks. And good luck.</i>

22:43.570 --> 22:45.072
So, what now?

22:45.072 --> 22:48.033
Well, there's still Putties in town.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.534
In every town.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.286
We can't morph.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.956
People aren't safe.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.959
- We gotta do something.
- Look...

22:58.919 --> 23:02.714
Now, we know Rita's on the Moon, right?
So why not let's just go there?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.049
Crash her party.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.676
Snizzard and Minotaur will get in the way.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.638
Unless we can draw them out.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.265
That's a good thought.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.351
I bet you I can develop something

23:14.351 --> 23:17.312
that will keep them away from the Moon
and keep them away from us.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.816
I bet you I can use stealth technology
I developed for Adam and Aisha.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.778
I bet you can too, Billy.
Love that big brain of yours.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.199
They're made of metal, right?
Maybe we can exploit that.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.410
Oh no.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.163
Is that... Minh?

23:35.664 --> 23:36.498
Minh!

23:36.998 --> 23:38.458
Ay, ay, ay!

23:47.467 --> 23:49.219
Get out of here. I've got this.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.598
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.476
You guys are in for a treat.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.647
It's morphin' time!

24:01.773 --> 24:02.983
Sabertooth Tiger!

24:22.002 --> 24:23.628
Whoa.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.259
Messing with this place was a big mistake.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.827
Time for Hip Hop Kido.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.293
Are you break-dance fighting?

26:06.731 --> 26:07.566
Minh.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.280
- I wanted to be like Mom.
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.992
Let's go.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.871
<i>You were right. It's just what we need.</i>

26:23.123 --> 26:26.126
The others got back from the youth center.
We'll head over and get set up soon.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.877
<i>Okay, great. See ya.</i>

26:27.877 --> 26:29.212
Awesome place.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.215
Who knew Cranston Tech
was hiding all this?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.885
Not the public and not my employees.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.888
This place is secret,
so let's, uh, keep it that way. Okay?

26:43.059 --> 26:44.477
She's gonna need a talk.

26:45.979 --> 26:46.813
Can I help?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.441
Thanks. I got this.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.111
- The plan needs you. It's urgent.
- Agreed.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.363
- All right. We'll be back soon.
- All right.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.328
Pleasure to meet you.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.288
- I am--
I'm sorry, Alpha.

27:04.164 --> 27:07.000
- Can we have the room?
- No problem, Zack.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.919
My sensors are detecting a vibe.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.340
Come on.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.175
Give it to me.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.307
If I thought this
was gonna get you in trouble,

27:22.307 --> 27:24.142
I never would have told you the truth.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.310
- But Billy--
- What?

27:25.977 --> 27:26.853
He insisted.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.397
He thought it'd be good for you.
Closure and all that.

27:29.397 --> 27:32.734
But here we are, in a full-on crisis,
and you're trying to play Ranger.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.069
What's wrong with that?

27:34.069 --> 27:36.738
All of you and Mom
did exactly the same thing.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.990
I'm just following her example.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.242
Isn't that a good thing?

27:45.080 --> 27:49.626
What do you think it means to be a Ranger?
Kicking butt? Cute quips? Having fun?

27:51.002 --> 27:51.920
It's hard.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.588
I know.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.050
But someone needs to dole out justice
on the bad guys.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.345
Rita killed Mom.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.514
She needs to go down.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.850
And I'm ready. I'm happy to do it.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.060
Whatever it takes.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.397
So why won't that thing let me morph?

28:10.980 --> 28:11.940
Minh...

28:12.899 --> 28:17.028
What you're feeling, what you want,
it's not justice. It's revenge.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.699
When I was your age, my mentor told me
that only monsters seek revenge.

28:21.282 --> 28:24.703
That's what Robo Rita is doing now.
She was defeated by the Rangers.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.580
Now she wants to even the score
and hurt us as much as she can.

28:27.580 --> 28:31.793
That's why she... did what she did to Trini.

28:34.003 --> 28:37.966
A mission of revenge can never end well.
That's not what I want for you.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.429
What about what I want?

28:43.513 --> 28:45.348
Maybe it's not your call.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.728
You wanna be a hero?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.147
It's a selfless path.

28:53.648 --> 28:56.443
It's not always easy. But I do my best.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.699
Setting aside your ambitions
can be a good thing.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.828
Like me, making sure
that you have a good life and a home.

29:08.163 --> 29:11.916
It was worth giving up
your career in Congress... for me?

29:13.168 --> 29:15.754
You are absolutely worth it.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.717
And if you can understand that,
then you can understand

29:20.717 --> 29:23.928
how hard Billy is trying to fix
what he set in motion.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.893
Zordon sacrificed himself for us long ago.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.020
You never met him.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.355
He was our mentor but almost

29:35.356 --> 29:36.232
a father figure.

29:37.650 --> 29:41.070
Billy was trying to bring him back.
He didn't know this would happen.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.951
I... I didn't know that's how he felt.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.665
Just stay here
while we execute our plan. Okay?

29:54.000 --> 29:54.918
Yeah.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.796
And don't worry.
We've saved the world before.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
Now it'll really pack a punch.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.895
All right, Kat. Lift her up.

30:22.028 --> 30:24.948
So, uh, this thing is used
to sort old scrap, huh?

30:24.948 --> 30:25.865
Yeah.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.661
Well, Minotaur and Snizzard
sure fit that definition.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.873
All right, we're set.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.837
Let's bait the trap.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.716
It's morphin' time! Triceratops!

30:43.716 --> 30:45.635
- Pterodactyl!
- Tyrannosaurus!

30:48.680 --> 30:50.306
All right, we're set.

30:50.306 --> 30:52.851
They could be here any second,
so look sharp.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.269
Hm.
Always do.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.815
Every Ranger we capture
gives us another boost to the finish line.

30:58.815 --> 31:03.361
It's funny. I never believed in
their whole teamwork thing,

31:03.361 --> 31:05.655
but together, they are more.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.199
More power for me, that is.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.580
Another three Rangers
just morphed in Angel Grove.

31:14.163 --> 31:16.583
Shall we?
Just go, then.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.461
Oh, higher power levels than I thought.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.591
Bingo.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.426
Surprise, Rangers.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.386
Oh, right there is perfect.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.853
What is this?

31:36.853 --> 31:39.314
Like your hairy friend said,
a surprise.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.941
Thanks. I hate it.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.402
Bye now! Ha!

31:45.528 --> 31:48.823
Yes, the trap's holding.
- Affirmative.

31:48.823 --> 31:52.410
The powerful electromagnetic field
will prevent them from teleporting away.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.579
Phase one, dusted. Yes!

31:54.579 --> 31:55.663
Good job.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.335
Wait. Hold up. You're letting them live?

32:01.127 --> 32:03.963
That doesn't seem right, does it?
What if they get loose?

32:03.963 --> 32:05.340
This is the plan.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.509
Look, all-out destruction
is rarely the most optimal strategy.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.680
Now, where are
those stealth tech projectors?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.975
Sorry.
I got lost in the vault again.

32:17.143 --> 32:20.521
These are one use only, so be careful.
Click here, and it projects

32:20.521 --> 32:24.025
a subatomic diffraction field that covers
infrared and ultraviolet light.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.568
- So we'll be invisible.
- Yep.

32:25.568 --> 32:29.656
- Ah, love it.
- Rita will never <i>see</i> phase two coming.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.491
- Robot's got jokes.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.369
We'll be back soon, and when that happens,
I need you to be here.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.912
Alpha will keep you company.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.747
Hm.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.711
Nice.
Let's make it quick.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.464
- Alpha, send us to Rita's lair.
On it.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.716
Ah, that's my foot!
Oops.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.259
Ow.
Sorry.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.220
I know I have heavy feet.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.475
Better get ready for what's coming.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.647
Uncle Zack told me
what being a hero means.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.816
Guess I'll warm up the volcano.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.444
- Mind if I borrow?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.196
- Okay. Thanks. Bye.
- But--

33:10.196 --> 33:11.864
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

33:18.913 --> 33:20.581
Maybe too much of a flex.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.375
Overdone.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.092
Hm.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.181
Come on!

33:38.725 --> 33:39.934
Why won't you fly?

33:41.310 --> 33:42.979
Hey! Hey!

33:43.813 --> 33:44.814
Help!

33:44.814 --> 33:46.941
They're after my boyfriend! That way!

33:48.693 --> 33:50.820
- Hero practice won't hurt.
Please!

33:52.822 --> 33:53.781
Woo-hoo!

33:59.829 --> 34:00.663
Where is he?

34:08.046 --> 34:08.921
Move! Move!

34:17.513 --> 34:18.347
Yeah!

34:18.347 --> 34:20.266
What a mess.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.645
Whoa!

34:25.396 --> 34:26.522
George!
- Ah!

34:41.788 --> 34:45.708
Somebody's lost.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.669
Hey, girlie, did you take a wrong turn?

34:48.669 --> 34:51.964
You don't remember me from the cemetery?
You messed with my people.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.592
And your boss killed my mom.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.095
We work for an intergalactic war criminal.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.097
You'll need to be a lot more specific.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.101
I'm Minh Kwan. And you're about to face

35:03.976 --> 35:05.478
the Sabertooth Tiger!

35:06.854 --> 35:10.233
- Wha--? I'm doing the world a favor.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.735
- Sabertooth Tiger!

35:12.735 --> 35:14.987
Now, what do we have here?

35:14.987 --> 35:17.573
Another kid playing the hero.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.576
I tend to make that difficult.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.411
Ask your mom.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.582
If I can't morph, then I'll take you down
the old-fashioned way.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.473
Praying Mantis style. Just like Trini.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.894
Tell me, child.

35:46.894 --> 35:50.731
Does being squashed like a bug
run in the family?

36:02.702 --> 36:07.582
Playtime's over.

36:29.020 --> 36:29.854
Whoa.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.067
Well, it looks like
we've got Rita's little science project

36:35.067 --> 36:36.319
all to ourselves now.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.072
Perhaps. Our distraction might've worked
for now, but it's not gonna last long.

36:40.656 --> 36:41.824
Oh man.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.577
They got a lot more Rangers
than I expected.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.289
- Snizzard is a piece of work.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.001
Tommy, look at you.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.587
Kat. No.

36:56.339 --> 36:59.884
- Snizzard created these snakes.
What does your scanner say?

36:59.884 --> 37:03.596
My readings show that their energy
is connected to our friends.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.349
If we don't destroy that monster,

37:06.349 --> 37:08.643
we can't move any of them
without causing them harm.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.770
- So back to the junkyard or... ?
- What is that?

37:13.856 --> 37:14.690
Oh no.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.610
That's what she's been up to.

37:17.610 --> 37:21.239
Is that some kind of space barrel?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.658
No, it's, uh... it's a space dumpster.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.410
Rita's creating a time portal.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.872
- That's what she came out of when we--
- Yes, when Zordon recruited us.

37:29.872 --> 37:32.208
So Rita's trying to contact
her younger self.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.001
But why?

37:34.001 --> 37:36.963
Why? So many reasons.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.007
- What? Minh! Are you okay?

37:40.007 --> 37:44.387
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
- Shush. The adults are talking.

37:44.387 --> 37:50.059
Have you figured it out, Billy?
Or has my genius surpassed even you?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.979
Let me guess. A Rita reunion

37:52.979 --> 37:55.439
and then some scheme
to conquer the galaxy?

37:55.439 --> 37:56.565
Not bad.

37:56.565 --> 38:01.779
I'll pass through this portal and give
years of knowledge to my younger self,

38:01.779 --> 38:05.283
making us absolutely unstoppable.

38:05.283 --> 38:09.453
We'll kill your do-gooding teenage selves
in their sleep

38:09.453 --> 38:13.374
before Zordon even thinks
to make you Rangers.

38:13.374 --> 38:17.461
You think you can rewrite 30 years
of history with some tin-pot gadget?

38:17.461 --> 38:18.379
Careful.

38:18.379 --> 38:22.591
Your friends are charging my machine
faster than I could have dreamed,

38:22.591 --> 38:25.428
so I don't need you anymore.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.638
I'll take out Snizzard.
You get the others.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.892
You know, your mom
will be a first for me, Minh.

38:31.892 --> 38:34.729
I've never killed anyone twice before.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.063
Hold that thought.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.609
Yah!

38:53.414 --> 38:54.749
Yes.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.002
Stop that.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.716
Oh, Cranston.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.386
What a waste!

39:08.346 --> 39:10.890
Trini died for you.

39:10.890 --> 39:14.518
And now you'll share her fate.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.192
No!

39:26.781 --> 39:28.407
No!
Minh!

39:32.036 --> 39:33.245
Minh!

39:33.829 --> 39:35.539
Yes, yes.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.250
This brings back memories.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.252
Minh?

39:46.467 --> 39:48.135
Oh, please, no.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.764
What a tragedy.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.266
That's what being selfless gets you.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.485
Minh, can you hear us?

40:05.361 --> 40:06.195
Minh?

40:11.367 --> 40:12.243
<i>Hi-ya!</i>

40:14.286 --> 40:17.039
<i>Ya!</i>

40:21.627 --> 40:22.670
Mom?

40:24.588 --> 40:27.550
I saw--
Oh, thank goodness.

40:27.550 --> 40:28.551
No way.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.678
What is this?

40:34.723 --> 40:37.101
- You know what this means, right?
- Go on.

40:37.935 --> 40:38.936
You wanna say it?

40:39.854 --> 40:40.938
Are you kidding?

40:45.151 --> 40:46.610
It's morphin' time!

40:47.903 --> 40:49.071
Mastodon!

40:49.071 --> 40:50.364
Pterodactyl!

40:50.364 --> 40:51.657
Triceratops!

40:51.657 --> 40:52.908
Sabertooth Tiger!

40:52.908 --> 40:54.243
Tyrannosaurus!

40:55.828 --> 40:56.954
Power Rangers!

40:57.621 --> 40:59.582
Whoa, it actually worked.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.042
You're a Ranger.
A legit Ranger.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.545
Putties, surround them.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.510
Time for phase three of the plan.

41:11.510 --> 41:12.970
Did we plan a phase three?

41:13.596 --> 41:16.307
Let me guess.
Phase three is laying the smackdown?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.391
Precisely.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.101
Bring it.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.148
Maybe watching you die
will cure my headache.

41:28.068 --> 41:31.489
Coming through.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.158
Love it.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.188
Kat, you're clear.
- Thanks, Rock.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.691
Uh, uh, uh. Think twice.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.861
You don't want to hurt
your tiny little friends.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.364
She's right. To free them,
we have to destroy Snizzard.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.908
Good luck with that.

42:16.825 --> 42:21.330
My queen. I don't understand.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.749
What did I do?

42:24.250 --> 42:30.798
Magic wand,
make my monster grow!

42:31.465 --> 42:34.009
Oh!

42:36.804 --> 42:39.807
Arise, Snizzard!

42:43.185 --> 42:44.979
She's distracted.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.898
Let's see them try to--

42:53.320 --> 42:55.030
That's enough out of her.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.369
Boss? No!

43:00.369 --> 43:03.289
One problem down.
Can you handle that hairy bot?

43:03.872 --> 43:06.083
Oh, easy.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.211
- Anything I can do?
- You're with me. We're going big.

43:09.712 --> 43:11.839
Alpha, we need Dinozord power. Now.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.215
You got it, Billy.

43:30.899 --> 43:37.781
Okay. Transmaterializing Zords
to lunar surface in three, two, one.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.374
Hold on, Minh. Time for battle mode.

43:51.712 --> 43:52.588
Whoa!

44:02.723 --> 44:05.434
So how the heck do you drive this thing?

44:06.018 --> 44:06.977
Do what I do.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.480
- You'll find it's second nature.
Okay.

44:10.606 --> 44:11.649
Here he comes.

44:31.710 --> 44:34.546
Now, this is the coolest.

44:34.546 --> 44:37.007
All right, you big lizard.
Come catch these hands.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.060
- Direct hit.
- Whoo!

44:50.771 --> 44:52.106
Don't let up.

44:52.106 --> 44:56.360
So you're fighting dirty.

44:56.944 --> 44:57.778
Yes!

44:58.278 --> 45:00.823
Come on.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.534
My club!

45:06.954 --> 45:08.330
Rocky, now!

45:15.546 --> 45:17.589
- Got him.
I'm not gonna lie, Rocky.

45:17.589 --> 45:20.092
That was... pretty hardcore.

45:20.092 --> 45:21.885
Well, beef is off the menu.

45:22.928 --> 45:24.596
Billy, how's the reptile?

45:24.596 --> 45:28.392
As cold-blooded as ever.
But we have room for three more in here.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.560
Copy that.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.895
So it's just me left.

45:31.895 --> 45:34.898
Good, I'll have you all to myself.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.151
Oh yeah.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.945
- I have been looking forward to this.
Together.

45:44.491 --> 45:50.330
Shattered circuits
can't keep a bad witch down.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.968
Heads up. He's still coming.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.182
Tails. You lose.

46:08.766 --> 46:14.271
They thought they could stop me,
but my masterpiece is fully charged.

46:14.855 --> 46:19.318
Finally, I can rule
with my younger, prettier self.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.654
I can't wait to see me again.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.787
Can we get
this thing on its feet?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.163
Is that what I think it is?

46:32.206 --> 46:33.707
Oh, great, the portal.

46:33.707 --> 46:34.958
We gotta move.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.961
System's back online.
Just have to-- There.

46:38.837 --> 46:39.797
Up we go.

46:42.841 --> 46:45.177
Mega Power Sword. Now!

46:51.975 --> 46:56.438
Now they will come,
and then she will be free.

46:56.438 --> 46:59.191
My past and my future.

47:00.692 --> 47:03.028
<i>It looks like a giant space dumpster.</i>

47:03.028 --> 47:04.613
<i>Let's open her up.</i>

47:04.613 --> 47:09.827
Yes, yes!

47:10.828 --> 47:14.081
And so it begins.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.958
What do you think?
Time to end this?

47:15.958 --> 47:17.251
Oh, definitely.

47:18.502 --> 47:19.586
Yeah!

47:27.553 --> 47:31.640
My circuits, they burn!

47:35.185 --> 47:37.437
Oof! What a way to go.

47:38.021 --> 47:41.483
No, my Snizzard. And my snakes.

47:41.483 --> 47:47.531
But no matter,
the Rita renaissance begins!

47:48.323 --> 47:53.036
<i>Ah! After ten thousand years, I'm free!</i>

47:54.162 --> 47:55.664
Sit down. Shut up!

47:55.664 --> 47:56.707
Huh?

47:58.876 --> 48:01.044
Rocky, get the other Rangers. Quick.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.212
Right behind you.

48:02.212 --> 48:04.214
- Take the shot, Kat.
- What?

48:04.214 --> 48:06.133
With pleasure.

48:08.510 --> 48:10.679
<i>Time to conquer Ea--</i>

48:10.679 --> 48:12.639
I'll kill you all!

48:12.639 --> 48:14.600
Shut her down. Do it, Zack.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.018
This is for Trini.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.651
Is that it? Is she gone?

48:25.235 --> 48:27.738
Affirmative. It's over.

48:28.697 --> 48:32.284
Like I said, Minh,
we always save the world.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.163
You missed all the action,
but I'm glad you made it.

48:36.663 --> 48:40.500
All the rescued Rangers
are secure in your spaceship's med bay

48:40.500 --> 48:42.377
and in stable condition.

48:42.377 --> 48:45.005
Well, our course for Aquitar is all set.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.466
The Aquitians will fix them up in no time.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.593
You sure you don't wanna join us, Billy?

48:49.593 --> 48:52.054
You know, uh,
Cestria did say she missed you.

48:52.054 --> 48:54.932
No. But I'll be there soon.

48:54.932 --> 48:57.059
I still have some company matters
that I gotta tie up

48:57.059 --> 48:59.478
before I can get back
to my old adventures.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.064
Look at you.
You've missed the travel, haven't you?

49:02.564 --> 49:04.483
It is nice
to have something new to focus on.

49:05.067 --> 49:08.862
But once the Aquitians get everyone
back to normal size and back in action,

49:08.862 --> 49:10.405
all of this will be over.

49:10.405 --> 49:14.201
Yeah, it's been a wild ride,
but I'm ready to get back to JJ.

49:14.201 --> 49:18.705
Being a parent is almost as challenging
as being a Ranger.

49:18.705 --> 49:21.208
You think that's tough?
I didn't even get lunch.

49:21.208 --> 49:24.836
- Somebody threw out my noodles.
- Sorry, sorry.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.173
Relax. Relax. Don't blow a circuit.
I'm just kidding.

49:28.173 --> 49:29.800
Even though they're small,

49:29.800 --> 49:32.177
we shouldn't keep
our fellow Rangers waiting.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.221
It was great catching up.

49:37.808 --> 49:41.144
I'm glad the Sabertooth Tiger legacy
is in great hands.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.063
It's an honor.

49:44.314 --> 49:46.441
Time to fire up the teleporter?

49:46.441 --> 49:49.319
- Yeah.
Sounds good. Let's go, Rocky.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.780
Inputting all of your coordinates now.

49:52.280 --> 49:55.158
Until next time,
may the power protect you all.

49:55.784 --> 49:56.702
And you.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.416
So what do you think
of your communicator?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.043
Love the vintage aesthetic.

50:05.752 --> 50:08.714
And if I'm late for class,
teleporting will be clutch.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.133
Uh, only if no one's looking, okay?

50:11.133 --> 50:12.759
- Okay.

50:13.510 --> 50:15.929
Look at this place.
I mean, it's as if nothing's changed.

50:15.929 --> 50:18.223
It's just a little bit...
I don't know, smaller, maybe.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.225
Maybe we've grown.

50:21.643 --> 50:25.522
You two want smoothies? I wanna know
if they still have Ernie's recipe.

50:25.522 --> 50:26.982
Sure.
- Sure.

50:30.777 --> 50:34.573
Can I get you anything while I'm away?
A souvenir from Mirinoi, maybe.

50:34.573 --> 50:35.949
I don't know.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.161
You won't be gone too long, will you?

50:39.828 --> 50:42.330
Mom always said she missed you
when you were in space.

50:43.665 --> 50:45.917
I mean, I'll miss you and...

50:48.420 --> 50:49.254
Um...

50:50.505 --> 50:51.339
Minh?

50:52.466 --> 50:54.259
It's just, before you go,

50:56.053 --> 50:57.304
all that stuff...

50:59.556 --> 51:00.557
Mom's passing.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.853
I said it was your fault,
and that wasn't fair.

51:06.354 --> 51:10.984
You couldn't have known what would happen
to Rita or what would happen to Mom.

51:14.321 --> 51:17.949
You didn't say anything about me
I haven't told myself a million times.

51:19.576 --> 51:21.953
No, but for real.
I should be thanking you.

51:23.413 --> 51:26.124
If you hadn't pushed Zack
to share the truth about Mom...

51:28.293 --> 51:30.712
I don't know
how I would have handled everything.

51:33.882 --> 51:34.841
You're a good kid.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.302
We're all looking out for you.

51:37.886 --> 51:40.138
And I'm really glad
you looked out for me too.

51:40.138 --> 51:41.848
You mean Rita's blast?

51:42.641 --> 51:43.683
I had to.

51:44.601 --> 51:45.560
You're family.

51:46.394 --> 51:47.729
Gotta protect your family.

51:49.856 --> 51:50.690
Family, huh?

51:52.734 --> 51:55.195
Is that why you thought it was okay
to borrow my flying car?

51:55.195 --> 51:57.489
Okay, that was Ranger business.

51:57.489 --> 51:58.824
Ah.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.993
I'm sorry. The Radbug
is proprietary technology.

52:02.577 --> 52:05.455
- You're grounded.
You think you can ground me?

52:05.956 --> 52:07.541
No, it doesn't work like that.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.960
- You're grounded.
- Look at you two.

52:10.752 --> 52:11.795
Oh man.

52:15.757 --> 52:16.883
She's so much like...

52:20.595 --> 52:22.013
Trini would be proud.

52:25.684 --> 52:26.768
You just reminded me.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.229
After Rita blasted me,

52:30.480 --> 52:31.898
I got a weird flash.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.277
These memories.

52:35.277 --> 52:36.361
Memories?

52:36.361 --> 52:38.155
Yeah, from the Morpher.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.615
Of you and Mom being Rangers.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.201
Being heroes.

52:43.785 --> 52:45.495
I mean, it's in optimal condition.

52:45.495 --> 52:47.706
Nothing out of the ordinary,
but who knows?

52:48.415 --> 52:51.293
The morphing grid
is a pathway to infinite possibilities.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.504
Maybe I shouldn't give up on Zordon.

52:55.547 --> 52:56.840
What were the memories like?

52:58.383 --> 52:59.384
It was weird. I--

53:00.260 --> 53:01.136
It was like

53:02.012 --> 53:04.055
I felt how much all of you meant to her.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.350
She meant a lot to us too.

53:08.059 --> 53:10.353
She was... a great friend.

53:10.937 --> 53:11.771
The best.

53:12.522 --> 53:13.356
The best.

53:14.608 --> 53:17.110
I wouldn't even be here
if she didn't overcome her fear of heights

53:17.110 --> 53:19.029
and get me out
of a really nasty cliffhanger.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.156
Mom was afraid of heights?

53:22.365 --> 53:24.201
Okay. What else didn't she tell me?

53:25.118 --> 53:27.954
That time Shellshock made her run,
and she couldn't stop.

53:27.954 --> 53:30.123
The weirdo
with the traffic light on his back?

53:30.123 --> 53:31.875
A traffic-light man?

53:31.875 --> 53:34.211
No, it wasn't a man. It was a turtle.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.962
- A turtle?

53:35.962 --> 53:38.381
- We have to tell her everything.
- Oh my goodness.

53:38.381 --> 53:40.467
It was a turtle.
