WEBVTT

00:03.233 --> 00:05.067
Did we really meet
at the New Music Seminar?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.167
I could hook you up with
an interview with Barry.

00:08.233 --> 00:09.367
All access.

00:09.433 --> 00:10.967
What's your angle
in all this?

00:11.033 --> 00:12.733
Is Fouray
rap's new king?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.500
Who's taking
Chuck's slot?

00:14.567 --> 00:15.833
Tony Humphries.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.133
I might have
a better idea.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.900
Saturday nights,
DJ DeeVee!

00:19.967 --> 00:21.600
We're gonna be
working together.

00:21.667 --> 00:25.100
And the week before last,
your boy Geronimo.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.000
I told ya I was
recording that night.

00:27.067 --> 00:28.633
Got a witness.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.967
Prep school.

00:30.033 --> 00:30.967
Not gonna work out.

00:31.033 --> 00:32.200
Call Scooter.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.867
David... David!

00:37.933 --> 00:39.133
It wasn't us, Barry.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.067
Someone on the floor
fired shots.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.967
Folks died, man.

00:43.033 --> 00:44.400
You know, we did good,
the two of us.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.000
They killed my boy.

00:50.067 --> 00:51.233
He's gone, Nikki.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.567
David's gone.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.600
... initial reports,

01:16.667 --> 01:18.800
Israeli jet fighters bombed
a guerilla base, killing...

01:18.867 --> 01:20.167
You okay?

01:20.233 --> 01:21.833
Fine, I just needed
to get a workout in.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.533
Cool.

01:27.667 --> 01:28.800
Oh, you don't
have to wash those.

01:28.867 --> 01:29.800
It's fine.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.300
Lil Ray?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.133
You know, I think I'm gonna
go for a run later on today.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.700
I don't know why
I stopped working out.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.433
Anymore thoughts about
going to the shiva?

01:49.500 --> 01:50.767
I went to
the funeral.

01:50.833 --> 01:52.300
Why do I need to go
to the shiva?

01:52.367 --> 01:54.167
It's tradition.
For the family.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.300
You are part of
the family.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.700
I don't think
I should go.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.533
I'm fine.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.067
I know.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.400
Let's got say
goodbye to David.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.067
Four people dead.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.867
Including Nikki's ex.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.333
We never should've put
money into this show.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.633
We did it for
the label.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.433
Barry.
Thank you, darling.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.300
I just had to
up and leave

02:32.367 --> 02:33.933
Mayor Dinkins at Tavern

02:34.067 --> 02:35.300
the moment
I got word.

02:35.367 --> 02:36.333
How is my favorite client?

02:36.400 --> 02:37.800
Oh, you out here,
big-timing,

02:37.867 --> 02:40.333
while I'm trying to figure
out how to stay off the news.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.933
Um... tell me you
got a plan.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.800
Well, you don't pay me
to not have a plan, do you?

02:46.067 --> 02:48.200
So your liability policy
should cover

02:48.267 --> 02:50.300
as long
as you're not at fault.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.100
And no matter what
the press says,

02:52.167 --> 02:53.667
you did not hire the security

02:53.733 --> 02:55.300
and you do not
own the building.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.100
It was like we was
silent partners.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.600
Precisely.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.833
Police report suggests
that someone in the crowd,

03:00.900 --> 03:04.733
unbeknownst to you, fired a gun,
caused a stampede.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.967
That had nothing
to do with us.

03:06.067 --> 03:06.967
Precisely.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.300
So just kick back, relax,

03:08.367 --> 03:09.733
and find you something else
to worry about.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.200
I'll handle it.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.367
Hazel McKena.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.967
That's my moms.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.233
Does she still live
in that apartment

03:19.300 --> 03:21.067
over there on
Carlton Avenue?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.567
With your sisters,
Denise and Angela, right?

03:23.633 --> 03:25.067
Yeah.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.667
Yeah, Auntie Gladys,

03:26.733 --> 03:28.533
she still live in
Carroll Gardens, right?

03:32.467 --> 03:33.567
Yeah, how you know
all that?

03:33.633 --> 03:35.933
The job is
ten grand.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.300
You down?

03:47.300 --> 03:48.433
I'm down.

03:52.067 --> 03:52.967
That's half.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.100
We ain't gonna have to worry
about prep school no more.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.067
Oh... let me grab that
from you.
Oh, thank you
so much.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.433
Let's take it in here.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.533
You should...

04:42.067 --> 04:43.500
Mr. Aaron,
I'm so sorry.

04:45.467 --> 04:46.600
Juggy?

04:50.433 --> 04:52.100
Oh, hey.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.100
How are you doing?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.200
Maybe if I hadn't
had broke up with him--

05:01.267 --> 05:02.633
Stop with
the guilt trip.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.267
But it's...

05:06.333 --> 05:07.733
Let's go talk
to them.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.933
Come on.

05:13.533 --> 05:14.667
Mrs. Aaron.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.567
Nice of you to
finally stop by.

05:19.933 --> 05:20.867
I...

05:20.933 --> 05:22.067
Uh, Damita, uh,

05:22.133 --> 05:23.567
let me introduce
you to some people.

05:31.267 --> 05:32.600
I would've stopped by
sooner,

05:32.667 --> 05:35.067
I just didn't know
if you'd want me here.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.333
Well, you two weren't
exactly in a good place

05:37.400 --> 05:38.733
when David died.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.467
I cared about David.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.067
A lot.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.867
I wish he were
here every day.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.867
Me too.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.267
I wish none of this
had happened.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.400
Me too.

05:56.467 --> 05:58.100
But it did.

05:58.167 --> 05:59.200
So if you'll
excuse me,

05:59.267 --> 06:02.533
I have to, um,
see my other guests.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.633
The police are here
to see you.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.067
What?
Is that so?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.633
Mr. Fouray.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.600
Detective Purdell,
NYPD.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.400
How-- how may we
help you, Detective?

06:29.467 --> 06:30.967
Following up
the investigation

06:31.067 --> 06:32.467
of Friday's concert.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.533
Multiple eyewitnesses
says your client,

06:34.600 --> 06:36.200
Rex Boogie, fired the gun,

06:36.267 --> 06:38.400
inciting the stampede
that left four dead.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.400
Yeah, but he had nothing
to do with that.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.967
You don't have to
say that.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.867
Well, if that's what he's
said, then he lied to you.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.867
Either way, we got
a problem.

06:54.267 --> 06:56.067
You okay?

06:56.067 --> 06:57.567
I tried calling you.

06:57.633 --> 06:58.933
I know, I just, uh--

06:59.067 --> 07:00.500
It's cool.

07:00.567 --> 07:03.133
Look, I'm here if you
wanna talk, all right?

07:03.200 --> 07:04.167
Mm-hmm.

07:07.967 --> 07:12.133
He was last seen around
1:40 a.m. on Saturday.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.067
Any idea where he
went after questioning?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.367
No.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.833
I think he maybe went
to sleep or went home.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.133
Oh, shit!

07:19.200 --> 07:21.100
This album
was the shit!

07:21.167 --> 07:23.167
Special Ed, that's you?!

07:23.233 --> 07:26.833
Detective Purdell,
uh, are you familiar with

07:26.900 --> 07:28.700
Captain Gerber over
at the 22nd?

07:28.767 --> 07:31.367
No, Counselor,
I'm from the 78th.

07:31.433 --> 07:32.900
Hmm, Brooklyn.

07:32.967 --> 07:35.067
And investigating
Manhattan incidence.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.200
Are you freelancing?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.100
They put me
on the case.

07:40.833 --> 07:42.567
You never know with
these rappers.

07:42.633 --> 07:45.233
Drugs, women,
street shit.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.500
All in the day's
work, right?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.067
Mr. Fouray would
not mind answering

07:49.133 --> 07:51.067
any of your questions
at a later date.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.600
As of right now, we have
more pressing issues--

07:52.667 --> 07:54.067
Y'all know about
his priors?

07:54.133 --> 07:55.733
Now, what does that have to
do with anything, Detective?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.400
Uh, smoking a little weed,
got caught holding.

07:58.467 --> 07:59.867
So what?

08:00.067 --> 08:03.300
The "what" is an old
assault and battery charge.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.633
A felony.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.733
Which has absolutely
nothing--

08:05.800 --> 08:08.300
Oh, fuck!

08:08.367 --> 08:10.367
I love this album!

08:10.433 --> 08:12.100
That's you too?!

08:12.167 --> 08:13.400
That...

08:13.467 --> 08:14.733
Are you done,
Detective?

08:14.800 --> 08:17.333
So where is he?
I don't know.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.567
You don't have to
answer that--

08:18.633 --> 08:19.900
Are you sure
about that?
Positive.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.500
You don't have to answer
anymore questions.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.200
This is borderline
harassment, Detective.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.300
Are you done?
So here's the deal.

08:25.367 --> 08:28.867
Either you find him
and bring him to me...

08:28.933 --> 08:31.967
or I'll issue a citywide
manhunt for his ass.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.533
Fouray don't need
that kind of press

08:33.600 --> 08:35.667
right now, do it?

08:35.733 --> 08:37.300
You got 24 hours.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.067
Good day, Detective.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.300
Counselor.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.667
What you doing here?

08:55.733 --> 08:56.733
My job.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.267
Nah, go home.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.567
I need to do
my job.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.533
And I'm telling you
you can go home.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.800
So go ahead,
it's all good.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.567
Go chill out.

09:04.633 --> 09:05.600
Tamika...
Yeah.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.900
... look, I need you
to pull up

09:06.967 --> 09:09.167
any info that you have
on Rex Boogie's people.

09:09.233 --> 09:10.633
All of it, okay?

09:10.700 --> 09:12.767
And, uh, Steven,

09:12.833 --> 09:14.967
I want you to go check
his baby mama house.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.800
He could
be there.
Okay.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.667
And, Ray, you gotta check
over at his grandma's.

09:18.733 --> 09:19.867
Got you.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.100
Is there anything
I could do?

09:22.167 --> 09:24.100
Uh...

09:24.167 --> 09:25.800
Yeah, Imani's upstairs
with Josie, right,

09:25.867 --> 09:26.800
working on
a video thing.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.167
Go check on it.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.400
I thought I wasn't
working with Imani X.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.133
It's all good,
though.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.633
Is her mom
up there too?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.767
Yeah, just stay
out of her way.

09:35.833 --> 09:36.767
Okay.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.400
Yeah, is Shanikwa there?

09:38.467 --> 09:40.800
Listen, if I'm gonna
get you out of this, man,

09:40.867 --> 09:42.367
I need to know
everything.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.267
No more surprises.

09:51.700 --> 09:52.667
Yeah, that's right.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.700
That's right, Imani.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.300
Keep your
chin down.

09:56.367 --> 09:58.533
I've been telling you that
since you were four.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.000
And stop with
all this b-boy shit.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.133
All right, Imani,
give me that fire.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.767
You know, that-- that, uh,
that, you know that--

10:04.833 --> 10:06.167
Yeah, love it.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.567
Girl, you ain't fooling
nobody with that!

10:08.633 --> 10:10.433
Do it like
Mama showed you!

10:16.000 --> 10:17.500
All right, all right,
come on.

10:17.567 --> 10:18.500
Give me that
fire again.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.500
That's right.

10:19.567 --> 10:20.567
And, Jessie...

10:20.633 --> 10:21.867
It's Josie.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.433
Her left side
is her best side...

10:28.500 --> 10:29.867
Miss Photographer.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.233
Let's take five.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.200
Take five?

10:36.267 --> 10:37.600
You ain't hardly
doing nothing

10:37.667 --> 10:39.133
and you ready
to take five?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.900
Well, while you're
taking five,

10:40.967 --> 10:43.567
take five of these cheesy
little outfits off this rack,

10:43.633 --> 10:46.133
'cause I didn't approve
any of this.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.133
Where is Barry?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.333
Barry?!

10:51.833 --> 10:52.833
Exsqueeze me!

10:52.900 --> 10:54.067
Uh, uh...

10:54.133 --> 10:55.900
What are you
doing here?

10:55.967 --> 10:58.067
I'm not even here,
I'm just watching.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.433
Oh no, no, no.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.833
Barry!

11:03.667 --> 11:06.067
What was that
all about?

11:06.067 --> 11:07.467
... get a defensive
line next year,

11:07.533 --> 11:09.667
I think we should
be pretty-- pretty good...

11:09.733 --> 11:11.067
Oh wait, okay,
let's go.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.067
Mr. Aaron, as a member
of the music business,

11:13.133 --> 11:15.067
what do you say to the people
that blame rap music

11:15.133 --> 11:17.067
for the violence
that took your son?

11:18.833 --> 11:19.967
Get out of my face!

11:28.400 --> 11:30.500
Great work on the piece
about Fouray.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.067
But we're
not running it.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.600
It's my profile,
my first feature.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.100
Rap's new king?

11:38.167 --> 11:39.733
With the concert
deaths, Rex Boogie?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.133
Fouray's at the center
of a shit storm

11:41.200 --> 11:42.767
and all
the real estate I've got

11:42.833 --> 11:45.467
needs to go toward
talking about that.

11:45.533 --> 11:47.067
Wait, wait, wait.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.900
You need me now
more than ever.

11:49.967 --> 11:51.533
Crime Beat's talking
about Fouray

11:51.600 --> 11:53.967
but I'm the only person
that's talked to Fouray.

11:54.067 --> 11:56.067
I mean, I spent the entire
day with the guy.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.567
The day of the concert,
we were at the show together.

11:58.633 --> 11:59.733
And giving what he said,

11:59.800 --> 12:01.167
this just might be
the latest fuckup.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.567
You've got quotes
to back that up?

12:07.633 --> 12:09.067
Several.

12:09.067 --> 12:10.533
You've got one hour
to rewrite it.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.900
I don't know
where Rex is.

12:17.967 --> 12:18.967
He called a couple of
weeks ago,

12:19.067 --> 12:20.333
middle of the night,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.433
crying about he's
finally gonna marry me

12:22.500 --> 12:23.900
and be a better dad.

12:23.967 --> 12:25.133
Well, look, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.067
Rex is in
some trouble.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.667
So if you know
anything--

12:28.733 --> 12:30.233
If I knew
where he was,

12:30.300 --> 12:32.067
I'd ask if he's gonna come
to Trey's birthday party.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.200
Excuse me, ma'am?

12:45.267 --> 12:46.533
Ma'am, I'm
Terrance Washington.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.900
I work for Fouray Management.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.567
We manage your
grandson's records.

12:53.867 --> 12:54.833
If you know where he is,
please tell me.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.200
He can be
in serious danger.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.800
Mm-hmm.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.233
Just as I suspected.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.500
Barry, you need to start
thinking down the line.

13:30.567 --> 13:31.733
What you mean?

13:31.800 --> 13:32.967
Just in case insurance
doesn't cover everything

13:33.067 --> 13:34.533
and people come
to sue.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.767
Ah, don't say that.
Well, I don't wanna
say it,

13:36.833 --> 13:38.567
but that's what you pay me for,
to say the things that need

13:38.633 --> 13:40.300
to be said even
when we don't want to.

13:40.367 --> 13:42.500
You're on shaky financial
ground as it is.

13:42.567 --> 13:46.700
And, uh, Fouray Management
assets, your personal assets,

13:46.767 --> 13:48.200
they will be targets.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.900
Damn!
Therefore, we should
move things around,

13:49.967 --> 13:51.167
and moving forward,

13:51.233 --> 13:53.067
we have to pay
everything in cash.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.967
Damn, man.
Everything.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.367
Jewelry bills,
cable bills,

13:57.433 --> 14:00.300
champagne bills,
employees' salaries.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.733
Gotta protect them from
stealing your thoughts!

14:08.800 --> 14:11.100
They could get at ya
if you ain't careful!

14:11.167 --> 14:13.367
Ya gotta protect them from
stealing your thoughts!

14:15.200 --> 14:16.533
Kid here's got
something to say.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.500
What do you need?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.100
I'm-- I'm here
to turn myself in.

14:22.433 --> 14:23.733
Turn yourself in
for what?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.500
It-- it was me.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.067
I killed Geronimo.

14:32.467 --> 14:33.467
Cuff him.

14:33.533 --> 14:35.700
Come on!

15:20.867 --> 15:22.067
Yo.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.067
It's done.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.300
Scooter came through.

15:25.867 --> 15:26.967
You sure?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.400
Yeah.

15:30.633 --> 15:31.600
All right.

16:03.367 --> 16:04.367
Yo, is Fouray gonna trip

16:04.433 --> 16:06.067
about us smoking out
his crib?

16:06.067 --> 16:09.133
Fouray would trip if this
place didn't smell like weed.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.733
Besides you're his
artist now.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.167
He works for you.

16:12.233 --> 16:13.667
I-- we all do.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.633
Your label,
your creative director...

16:16.700 --> 16:18.167
your manager.

16:18.233 --> 16:20.433
Don't let my mama
hear you say that.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.367
Maybe your mom
should hear you say it.

16:22.433 --> 16:24.167
Look, you met
my mother.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.533
Yeah, I have.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.133
She kind of
reminds me of mine.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.833
Means well but she wants me to
be who she wants me to be.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.533
Man, I remember this one
talent show I did,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.133
I only went to
sing one song,

16:35.200 --> 16:36.600
and that was
the "Redemption Song."

16:36.667 --> 16:37.800
Jah bless!

16:39.200 --> 16:42.567
But she said
I had to sing

16:42.633 --> 16:43.767
"The Greatest
Love of All."

16:43.833 --> 16:45.067
Oh...

16:45.100 --> 16:47.067
She put me in this
long sparkly dress...

16:47.100 --> 16:48.667
Yes.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.633
... this long
sparkly dress

16:50.700 --> 16:53.133
and she did my hair
like Whitney's.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.400
Yo, she
worked so hard.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.600
She worked so hard

16:57.667 --> 16:59.900
for us to get
all the way there

17:00.067 --> 17:01.633
and there's four girls

17:01.700 --> 17:03.067
and some dude with
this high-ass voice...

17:03.133 --> 17:04.300
No--

17:04.367 --> 17:06.833
... that sung the same
exact song!

17:06.900 --> 17:09.733
I was done.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.933
That was the first thing
I've ever won.

17:12.067 --> 17:12.967
Really?

17:13.067 --> 17:14.600
And it's because
I sung Bob.

17:16.833 --> 17:17.900
Man...

17:20.633 --> 17:21.900
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:21.967 --> 17:24.100
you are now
listening to the sounds

17:24.167 --> 17:26.233
of the one, the only

17:26.300 --> 17:28.867
super producer
DJ DeeVee!

17:31.767 --> 17:33.267
... man.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.433
Anyway, I'm--
I'm just bugging.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.067
Uh, I'm gonna be late

17:36.100 --> 17:38.767
but I'm gonna be there,
so don't go on without me.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now listening...

17:48.700 --> 17:50.333
All right,
I'm on my way out.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.433
I'm gonna be gone
for awhile.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.567
Don't forget
to eat, all right?

17:52.633 --> 17:53.967
All right.
Chicken in the fridge.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.467
All right.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.867
You know what,
matter of fact...

18:05.067 --> 18:06.833
... get some takeout,
on me.

18:08.533 --> 18:09.700
Hmm?
Thanks.

18:09.767 --> 18:10.800
Yeah.

18:19.867 --> 18:20.700
Anything?

18:20.767 --> 18:21.767
No, Rex Boogie's
mama said

18:21.833 --> 18:23.133
she ain't
seen him in weeks,

18:23.200 --> 18:24.700
which is for sure
a damn lie.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.767
How you feeling?

18:30.833 --> 18:32.767
Uh, okay,
I think--
Let me ask you.

18:32.833 --> 18:34.367
I'm about to go visit
the victims' families,

18:34.433 --> 18:36.167
it's Anders' idea,

18:36.233 --> 18:38.633
but I wanna be able to
offer help

18:38.700 --> 18:40.400
for the funeral
and all the expenses.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.500
That's generous.

18:43.567 --> 18:45.200
I gotta put a face on
Fouray Management,

18:45.267 --> 18:46.900
you know what
I mean, you know?

18:46.967 --> 18:48.900
So I was thinking like if
you want to come along,

18:48.967 --> 18:50.633
it might help people
see that, you know,

18:50.700 --> 18:52.267
we know what
they going through,

18:52.333 --> 18:53.733
since-- since,
you know...

18:59.533 --> 19:01.867
Oh, man...
you know what?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.067
My bad, my bad.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.333
You're all good.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.933
Just-- your desk
is overflowing with--

19:06.067 --> 19:06.967
I'll get my purse.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.400
Barry, bringing Nikki
along--
I don't need--

19:12.467 --> 19:13.667
That ain't right.
I don't need
to hear it.

19:13.733 --> 19:14.933
You know what?
I know!

19:15.067 --> 19:17.500
I know this office
and all of you--

19:17.567 --> 19:19.367
you're my family.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.100
I need to keep
the fuckin' lights on

19:21.167 --> 19:22.467
and make payroll,

19:22.533 --> 19:24.067
and if it means that--
that a few people

19:24.100 --> 19:27.233
feel better because
Nikki can relate to they pain,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.933
then I'm gonna
do it.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.167
I'm gonna do it!

19:30.233 --> 19:31.667
Ready?
Yeah.

19:40.267 --> 19:41.567
Hey, yo, throw some extra

19:41.633 --> 19:43.067
fortune cookies up
in that motherfucker...

19:45.067 --> 19:46.700
Hey, yo, check it.
Snatch that, nigga.

19:47.967 --> 19:48.933
Oh snap!

20:02.033 --> 20:03.967
Yeah, where the fuck
do you think you're going, huh?

20:04.033 --> 20:04.933
Come here!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.500
Get the fuck
back here!

20:07.933 --> 20:08.867
No!

20:10.133 --> 20:11.400
Huh?

20:11.467 --> 20:13.433
I told you what was gonna
happen, right?!

20:13.500 --> 20:15.133
So get your
motherfucking ass up.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.800
Get your ass up,
nigga!

20:24.433 --> 20:25.533
What the fuck
you doing out, huh?

20:25.600 --> 20:26.700
They let me go!

20:26.767 --> 20:27.967
What the fuck
you mean?

20:28.033 --> 20:29.000
I forgot I was...

20:29.067 --> 20:31.967
That night...
man, I was high.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.500
Speak on.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.533
That night, you know,
I was already in the tank

20:35.600 --> 20:36.900
on a warrant, yo.

20:36.967 --> 20:38.333
Don't say that shit
when I ask, nigga.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.333
I told you!

20:39.400 --> 20:40.600
Nigga was smoking SS.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.033
Shit, I might've said
anything, yo.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.767
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on,

20:43.833 --> 20:45.400
hold up, hold up, yo,
hold up!

20:45.467 --> 20:46.867
Yo, man, I ain't
tell 'em nothing, man, huh?!

20:46.933 --> 20:49.200
I didn't say
nothing.
You ain't say shit?

20:49.267 --> 20:51.167
Man, I ain't say shit.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.633
But, Ahm, yo,
they on you, yo.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.433
They was-- they was
asking about you.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.433
You, Ahm, you!

20:56.500 --> 20:57.433
Fuck this nigga.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.800
Wait!

21:02.867 --> 21:04.967
I want my
money today.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.300
All right, all right.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.967
If anybody hear about
our deal,

21:10.067 --> 21:12.067
your mama...

21:12.100 --> 21:13.333
your sisters...

21:13.400 --> 21:14.767
Yeah, nigga.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.867
... your Aunt Gladys over
in Carroll Gardens,

21:17.933 --> 21:19.133
they all dead.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
You understand, nigga?

21:22.667 --> 21:24.067
I got you, man,
I got you!

21:24.100 --> 21:25.067
Chill, y'all.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.067
Are we good?

21:27.333 --> 21:28.767
Get the fuck
out of here!

22:00.767 --> 22:02.067
Been playing that
a lot.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.200
Only song I can
sing right about now.

22:09.467 --> 22:10.933
Ronnie was
your brother?

22:13.067 --> 22:14.367
More like a son.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.700
Must've been close.

22:16.767 --> 22:20.467
After Mama died, all we
had left was each other.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.300
He was ten,
I was 19.

22:23.367 --> 22:25.467
Good kid.

22:25.533 --> 22:28.067
He wanted to
go off to college,

22:28.100 --> 22:29.933
so he joined the army
for one of them--

22:30.067 --> 22:31.167
them GI bills.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.567
Went to that concert
to celebrate

22:34.633 --> 22:36.167
before he
went off to boot camp.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.767
I'm just-- really,
I'm...

22:43.833 --> 22:47.533
terribly, terribly
sorry for your loss, man.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.100
I just wanna be able to
help some way.

22:49.167 --> 22:53.667
I... I could help
with the funeral expenses.

22:53.733 --> 22:56.200
Set up a scholarship or
something in his name.

22:56.267 --> 22:57.533
Something.

22:59.167 --> 23:00.400
All right.

23:00.467 --> 23:01.700
I guess I could
use the help.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.633
Oh... oh, here.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.733
This is-- this is--
it's a formality.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.700
I'm sorry, uh...

23:15.067 --> 23:16.933
Since we're...
you know?

23:17.067 --> 23:18.733
Just to sign
something, these...

23:21.067 --> 23:22.300
I'll look at it.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.433
Get back to you.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.233
You know...

23:26.300 --> 23:28.067
you're not alone.

23:28.100 --> 23:31.733
Um, Nikki here,
my assistant,

23:31.800 --> 23:34.100
she... she lost
her boyfriend David

23:34.167 --> 23:35.633
at-- at the concert too.

23:36.900 --> 23:39.833
So... yeah, you-- you--
you're not alone.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.933
Ain't that right, Nikki?

23:49.100 --> 23:50.267
Yup.

23:52.700 --> 23:53.967
You poor thing.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.800
Hey, Junior!

24:16.867 --> 24:18.833
Junior, come down
here, boy!

24:22.300 --> 24:25.467
Hey... I know you
know what this is.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.433
Yeah.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.200
Well, have you ever
listened to the words?

24:31.267 --> 24:32.767
I mean, really listen?

24:34.467 --> 24:35.567
No, not really.

24:35.633 --> 24:37.533
Hoo-hoo, boy,
you about to.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.367
They wrote this for
Marvin Gaye

24:39.433 --> 24:41.467
after he, um...

24:41.533 --> 24:43.500
well, after he
passed.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.867
Now, if you
gonna make music,

24:45.933 --> 24:47.767
I want you to make
history.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.433
But you can't make history
if you don't know it, boy.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Samson King

24:52.667 --> 24:55.067
at 102.6 FM,

24:55.100 --> 24:57.133
here to offer some healing
for those feeling

24:57.200 --> 24:59.100
the pain of
the last few days.

24:59.167 --> 25:02.067
We at WPPS lost someone
near and dear

25:02.133 --> 25:03.600
to our hearts last week.

25:03.667 --> 25:06.667
This next one goes out
to my beloved former assistant

25:06.733 --> 25:10.600
who truly strove to keep it
smooth and sexy.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.300
David Aaron...

25:12.367 --> 25:15.367
I know you're riding that
white stallion to paradise.

25:15.433 --> 25:16.933
Rest in pleasure, baby.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.200
Oh hell no.

25:22.267 --> 25:24.100
Junior, Junior!

25:24.167 --> 25:26.500
Tragedy struck the music
industry this week,

25:26.567 --> 25:28.133
and this time rap singers

25:28.200 --> 25:30.433
weren't the only ones
caught in the crosshairs.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.467
Jonah Aaron, a grieving father,
lashes out.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.933
Mr. Aaron, as a member
of the music business,

25:36.067 --> 25:37.967
what do you say to the people
that blame rap music

25:38.067 --> 25:39.800
for the violence
that took your son?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.533
Get out of my face!

25:49.567 --> 25:52.067
Three other families
also suffer.

25:52.067 --> 25:54.633
I think I cried out
all the tears already.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.633
Just sit up all night.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.767
One question
in my mind:

25:58.833 --> 26:00.300
Did he call for me?

26:02.067 --> 26:03.900
Shouldn't be burying no
22-year-old

26:03.967 --> 26:06.233
'cause he went
out to a club.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.867
I wanna
get over this.

26:08.933 --> 26:10.633
I just want him back.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.067
You know, my thing is,
where's the security?

26:13.133 --> 26:14.533
How did somebody get in
here with a gun

26:14.600 --> 26:16.267
in the first place?

26:16.333 --> 26:18.100
Just a guy who bought a ticket,
going to see a good show...

26:18.167 --> 26:20.067
Lil Ray's
on line one.

26:22.967 --> 26:24.167
Talk to me.

26:25.833 --> 26:28.233
What?
I'll be there.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.667
Yes!

26:29.733 --> 26:31.067
Lil Ray found him.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.500
Fouray Management,
Tamika speaking.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.700
Hi, it's Damita Alonzo
from "The Village Voice"

26:43.767 --> 26:45.833
calling for Nikki Jones.

26:45.900 --> 26:46.933
Ms. Jones is out of
the office.

26:47.067 --> 26:48.433
Can I take a message?

26:50.333 --> 26:51.267
It's okay.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.500
I'll page her.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.967
Thanks.

27:01.733 --> 27:02.967
Mm...

27:03.067 --> 27:04.300
You can use
the phone if you want.

27:04.367 --> 27:06.400
Mm-mm-mm, nah, nah, nah,
it's just Damita.

27:06.467 --> 27:08.300
I will call her later,
after another shot.

27:08.367 --> 27:10.600
No, you can't
pour for yourself.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.933
Come on.

27:13.067 --> 27:14.533
Way too many rules.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.733
No wonder our cultures
have so much beef.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.533
Ooh!
Mmm!

27:29.333 --> 27:30.800
That shit's strong,
yo.

27:30.867 --> 27:32.633
Yeah,shochu kicks ass.

27:32.700 --> 27:35.400
All part of my plan to
get you liquored up.

27:35.467 --> 27:37.200
Make you
talk about your feelings.

27:40.433 --> 27:43.067
You know, I was there,
Nikki, at the concert.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.167
So if you wanna
talk about it--

27:46.233 --> 27:47.367
What were you
doing there?

27:48.733 --> 27:52.133
Shooting publicity photos of
Rex and the other rappers.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.067
You know,
when things jumped off,

27:54.100 --> 27:57.133
I just... kept shooting.

27:59.233 --> 28:00.700
Have you seen any
of the photos?

28:02.533 --> 28:04.533
No, not yet.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.067
Maybe I never will.

28:10.367 --> 28:12.067
Why'd you even go
with Barry today?

28:16.100 --> 28:17.500
It's Barry.

28:19.833 --> 28:20.767
I don't know.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.367
I...

28:22.433 --> 28:24.133
He needed me,
so I did it.

28:25.267 --> 28:26.600
What about what
you need?

28:36.233 --> 28:38.233
You're supposed to be watching
over this type of shit.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.300
Okay, I got something.

28:41.367 --> 28:43.667
Need you to not read it
until after

28:43.733 --> 28:44.700
the press conference.

28:44.767 --> 28:45.700
What?

28:45.767 --> 28:46.700
It's "The Village Voice."

28:46.767 --> 28:47.967
Ah, dope, dope.

28:48.067 --> 28:49.067
No, no, no, no, no,
but it's best

28:49.100 --> 28:50.300
you don't read it.

28:50.367 --> 28:52.100
No really, later.
What the fuck?

28:52.167 --> 28:53.233
Barry, I need your
head in the game.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.933
I can't believe this.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.700
Shit, look at this.
You can only handle
one thing at a time.

28:56.767 --> 28:58.567
I don't believe this!
Rex Boogie and family.

29:00.967 --> 29:02.833
Oh...

29:02.900 --> 29:05.267
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.833
So... so how's this?

29:06.900 --> 29:08.067
This cool?

29:08.133 --> 29:09.333
You look perfect.
It's perfect.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.667
Well, not quite perfect.

29:10.733 --> 29:12.200
I think your sleeves are
a little too long,

29:12.267 --> 29:13.500
you could use a tie,
but other than that,

29:13.567 --> 29:15.167
you look like
a model citizen.

29:15.233 --> 29:17.300
That's what you're gonna
be now-- a model citizen.

29:17.367 --> 29:18.967
No drugs, no groupies.

29:19.067 --> 29:21.633
Just your love for your wife,
your love for you son,

29:21.700 --> 29:24.733
every Sunday you wake up
and go to sunrise services.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.200
I don't go to church.

29:26.267 --> 29:27.667
Well, you do now.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.200
Now that you accidentally
discharged a firearm

29:30.267 --> 29:31.700
out of sheer enthusiasm,

29:31.767 --> 29:33.967
knowing that this wasn't
the most prudent move for you,

29:34.067 --> 29:35.467
but now you're willing to accept

29:35.533 --> 29:38.500
full Christian responsibilities
for your indiscretions.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.900
Now, everybody who wants
to stay out prison, say, "Amen."

29:40.967 --> 29:42.067
Amen.
Amen.

29:42.133 --> 29:43.267
Amen!

29:43.333 --> 29:45.400
See how that works?
Can you feel it?

29:46.833 --> 29:49.100
My head...
is pounding.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.433
Yo, I feel like
shit.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.900
Thank you so much
for this jacket.

29:51.967 --> 29:54.700
It's a lifesaver.
Yeah, it looks
good on you.

29:54.767 --> 29:56.633
Hey, hold up, wait.

29:56.700 --> 29:57.967
What-- what's that?

29:58.067 --> 29:59.300
What's going on?
I don't know.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.267
Uh, all right.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.600
Uh... listen, uh,
I wanna thank you all for

30:04.667 --> 30:05.867
coming out today.

30:05.933 --> 30:08.600
Uh, you know,
we-- we-- we're interested

30:08.667 --> 30:11.400
in providing y'all, you know,
with information.

30:11.467 --> 30:14.767
It starts the healing process
for the victims' families.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.133
Mr. Fouray would like to
make a statement first

30:19.200 --> 30:21.100
and will field
questions afterwards.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.533
Thank you.

30:22.600 --> 30:26.267
We are interested
in the healing, not rumors.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.700
So I wanna bring forward

30:27.767 --> 30:30.333
my client and his family,
Rex Boogie.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.067
Well... I appreciate
y'all giving me this time

30:36.133 --> 30:38.300
and I'm sorry about
what happened.

30:38.367 --> 30:40.900
Last Friday,
at the Whitman Ballroom,

30:40.967 --> 30:42.300
I was...

30:42.367 --> 30:43.933
fooling around
with my gun

30:44.000 --> 30:45.767
and I-- I shot
it in-- in the air.

30:47.900 --> 30:50.200
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.600
It was foolish,
it was stupid.

30:51.667 --> 30:52.800
I wish
I could take it back.

30:52.867 --> 30:54.100
Bullshit!

30:54.167 --> 30:55.867
Nik-- Nikki,
Nikki, Nikki!

30:57.267 --> 31:00.067
Break it up,
break it up!

31:00.100 --> 31:01.300
Let me go!

31:01.367 --> 31:03.600
Put me down, put me down,
I'm fine!

31:03.667 --> 31:04.900
Now put me down!

31:06.767 --> 31:08.467
That's enough already!
Stop!

31:09.900 --> 31:11.067
Get the fuck
off of me!

31:11.100 --> 31:12.700
Stay back, stay back.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.900
Tell me why I shouldn't
fire your ass right now?

31:29.833 --> 31:31.833
Don't say your
boyfriend's death

31:31.900 --> 31:33.600
because I told you to
take your ass home.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.300
And please...

31:37.900 --> 31:39.733
... don't say it's 'cause you
got me in "The Village Voice."

31:39.800 --> 31:40.800
Have you seen it?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.867
Have you seen it?

31:44.933 --> 31:45.900
Okay, well...

31:47.167 --> 31:48.667
"Stampeded.

31:48.733 --> 31:52.167
"Rap mogul Barry Fouray's
big plans get trampled.

31:52.233 --> 31:53.800
"Gordie Charlon,
son of Harlem,

31:53.867 --> 31:57.333
"restaurateur and
Fouray's longtime partner

31:57.400 --> 31:59.333
"was accused of
embezzlement.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.567
"According to sources
inside the company...

32:02.633 --> 32:06.300
"Fouray discovered
evidence of the theft

32:06.367 --> 32:08.733
"and responded by brutally
beating

32:08.800 --> 32:11.633
Mr. Charlon
in front of his staff."

32:11.700 --> 32:13.500
Yes!

32:13.567 --> 32:16.133
"Violence continues
to shadow Fouray

32:16.200 --> 32:18.900
"with the stampede
at his client's

32:18.967 --> 32:21.667
"Rex Boogie's
concert last Friday night

32:21.733 --> 32:24.267
which claimed the lives
of four fans."

32:25.733 --> 32:28.267
But that's nothing
'cause this is the best part.

32:28.333 --> 32:32.067
"Fouray was poised to
take the throne

32:32.067 --> 32:33.533
"as the king of rap.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.500
"But during an outburst
at the New Music Seminar,

32:36.567 --> 32:39.367
"Mr. Charlon accused him
of being nothing more

32:39.433 --> 32:40.800
than a court jester."

32:45.400 --> 32:47.600
That's... terrible.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.067
I thought this Damita
was your homey.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.133
I didn't know
she was gonna be

32:53.200 --> 32:55.300
a backstabbing
little bitch.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.400
Nikki?

32:59.467 --> 33:01.067
Hello, Nikki!

33:01.100 --> 33:02.067
Talk, say something!

33:02.100 --> 33:03.433
What are you
thinking?!

33:05.833 --> 33:06.767
They're right.

33:09.067 --> 33:11.433
You lied to
cover your ass,

33:11.500 --> 33:12.800
to make Rex look good.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.733
He's just a fool.

33:17.833 --> 33:18.867
And so are you.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.667
Did we really meet
at the New Music Seminar?

33:38.667 --> 33:40.200
No.

33:40.267 --> 33:42.133
You're fired.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.600
Whoa, no, no, no,
hey, no, Barry...
Get your ass
out of here!

33:44.667 --> 33:46.633
No, no, wait, Nikki,
come back, wait!
Crazy...

33:46.700 --> 33:48.600
No, Barry, you can't
do that to her!
I just did!

33:48.667 --> 33:50.400
Her boyfriend died--
I don't give a shit!

33:50.467 --> 33:51.467
I told her to
take her ass home!

33:51.533 --> 33:53.100
And then you had her
go with you

33:53.167 --> 33:54.200
to a victim's house!

33:54.267 --> 33:55.600
She's a liar!
I don't care!

33:55.667 --> 33:58.833
That girl busts her
ass for you every day!

33:58.900 --> 34:00.667
You are her fucking
hero!

34:00.733 --> 34:01.700
Do you not see that?!

34:01.767 --> 34:03.433
Do you know
what I see?

34:03.500 --> 34:06.200
I see where my fucking
priorities are!

34:06.267 --> 34:07.333
You know what they are?

34:07.400 --> 34:09.700
Saving this motherfucking
company!

34:09.767 --> 34:12.167
And saving the one
that I'm starting now!

34:12.233 --> 34:13.600
That's the program!

34:13.667 --> 34:15.667
You're either with it
or you're not!

34:22.067 --> 34:24.433
Once upon a time...

34:24.500 --> 34:26.433
you were my
hero too.

34:43.333 --> 34:44.633
Unbelievable.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.733
Let's go to
the shiva, Nikki.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.300
Let's talk about your
feelings, Nikki.

34:51.367 --> 34:53.100
You played me
all day long.

34:53.167 --> 34:54.133
I understand why
you're angry,

34:54.200 --> 34:55.933
which is why
I tried to call.

34:56.067 --> 34:57.667
Did you leave a message?
Well, it's not
the sort of thing

34:57.733 --> 34:58.867
that you leave
in a message.

34:58.933 --> 35:01.067
It's not the sort of
thing you do.

35:01.067 --> 35:02.300
Nikki, I am not you.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.200
I'm a journalist, and the
truth is not negotiable.

35:05.267 --> 35:07.467
You ain't shit.

35:07.533 --> 35:08.800
You're third string.

35:08.867 --> 35:10.333
Whoa, okay, all right,
I'm sorry--

35:10.400 --> 35:12.500
Take your fuckin'
hand off of me!
I'm sorry.

35:12.567 --> 35:15.133
Get the fuck
off of me!
Come on!

35:15.200 --> 35:17.433
I'm sorry, y'all.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.767
Damita, you okay?

35:18.833 --> 35:20.867
Now is not a good time.

35:20.933 --> 35:22.300
But it's a good time for
you to come to Damita's job

35:22.367 --> 35:23.700
and show your ass?
Uh-uh.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.300
Who you talking to with
all that bass in your voice?

35:25.367 --> 35:27.300
Nah, you need to
check yourself--
No, I just got fired!

35:27.367 --> 35:28.667
You just got fired?
Are you serious?

35:28.733 --> 35:30.467
David died!
What the fuck?!
Don't even!

35:32.300 --> 35:33.233
You know what?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.567
Fuck you, Nikki,
okay?

35:34.633 --> 35:37.067
You wanna keep
playing pretend, go ahead.

35:37.067 --> 35:38.500
But he's gone.

35:38.567 --> 35:40.500
David's gone and he's
not coming back!

35:43.800 --> 35:45.100
You don't wanna deal
with that, then fine.

36:05.633 --> 36:07.633
Can I help you?

36:07.700 --> 36:11.067
That... is for
Barry Fouray.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.267
I'm a little hungry.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.933
Oh my God.

36:46.467 --> 36:48.600
All due respect,
I just don't understand.

36:48.667 --> 36:49.900
You don't want your
hip-hop DJ

36:49.967 --> 36:51.200
to play hip-hop?

36:51.267 --> 36:53.233
Unity needs
time to heal.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.800
Stick with this
preapproved set list.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.367
Rap ain't going nowhere.

36:59.433 --> 37:01.333
It'll be there
when we're ready.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.733
Now if you'll
excuse me.

37:08.167 --> 37:09.400
I'm sorry.

37:09.467 --> 37:10.567
I'm sorry.

37:10.633 --> 37:12.067
I was there.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.767
I know there's a lot of
people out there hurting,

37:13.833 --> 37:16.067
but there's some in here
as well.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.867
And this is not
how we heal.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.733
Just think
about it... please.

37:23.433 --> 37:24.567
Look, I'm sorry about
David.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.567
We all miss him.

37:26.633 --> 37:29.200
But no rap
tonight.

37:29.267 --> 37:30.267
Get in the studio.

37:38.867 --> 37:40.500
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I hope
you have your tokens,

37:40.567 --> 37:45.067
New York City, 'cause you
are now riding with DJ DeeVee!

37:46.800 --> 37:48.067
Now, tonight we're gonna do
a little tribute

37:48.067 --> 37:49.900
to my main man, my brother,

37:49.967 --> 37:51.733
the one and only
David Aaron,

37:51.800 --> 37:54.500
and to all
the people we lost.

37:54.567 --> 37:55.867
We miss you.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.567
I hope you love me
for this one.

37:59.633 --> 38:00.933
Rest in peace.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.700
Son of a bitch!

38:15.733 --> 38:16.933
Hey, get me security.

38:19.433 --> 38:20.667
And my bat.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.067
No, hold on.

38:29.267 --> 38:30.767
95 Ride.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.333
95.5 Ride.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.067
Thank you for calling.

38:35.267 --> 38:36.967
Never mind.

38:38.433 --> 38:39.533
Shit!

38:59.867 --> 39:01.067
Yo, Damita,
let me holler at you.

39:01.067 --> 39:02.300
Yeah, what do you...

39:21.800 --> 39:23.067
We need your help.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.400
Now boarding
the Grand Motorways bus

39:29.467 --> 39:31.167
to Washington, DC...
How you doing?

39:31.233 --> 39:34.067
... with stops in
Philadelphia, Bloomington,

39:34.133 --> 39:36.767
Baltimore,
New Carrollton, Maryland

39:36.833 --> 39:37.967
and our final stop:

39:38.067 --> 39:39.900
Washington, DC,
Union Station.

39:39.967 --> 39:41.100
All aboard.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.100
Hi.
Hello.

39:47.767 --> 39:49.733
Hello, how are you doing?
Good evening, sir.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.500
Next time on "The Breaks"...

40:33.567 --> 40:35.433
When Fouray Records come in
the motherfucking house,

40:35.500 --> 40:38.300
we just gonna turn
this shit over on its ear.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.267
$50,000 a family.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.067
We're ready to
settle.

40:42.133 --> 40:44.733
Do this a couple more
times, got an album.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.433
You really think
it's dope?

40:46.500 --> 40:49.033
Man, this is the greatest
thing that I've ever created.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.300
They are having
a job fair

40:50.367 --> 40:51.367
at my office today.

40:51.433 --> 40:52.900
I've got the perfect
outfit for you.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.200
What happened?

40:55.267 --> 40:57.133
He freaked out on me
because of the article.
