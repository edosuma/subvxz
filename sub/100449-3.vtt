[buzzer sounds, door clicks]

44:50.425 --> 44:53.929
- Come on.
- Where?

44:54.012 --> 44:55.639
Berenson's been
waiting for you.

44:55.722 --> 44:57.015
Saul's here?

44:57.099 --> 44:58.517
In the SCIF
talking to the president.

44:58.600 --> 44:59.935
Apparently there's
been a breakthrough

45:00.018 --> 45:02.312
in the negotiations.

45:07.317 --> 45:09.236
[door closes]

45:09.319 --> 45:10.362
[door beeps]

45:10.445 --> 45:13.115
[Saul] ...our government
to the process.

45:13.198 --> 45:16.034
Without that,
we wouldn't even be here.

45:18.453 --> 45:21.039
<i>Is that you, Ms. Mathison?</i>

45:21.123 --> 45:22.708
<i>Um, it is, sir.</i>

45:22.791 --> 45:23.542
Glad you could join us.

45:23.625 --> 45:26.545
And it's nice
to finally meet you.

45:26.628 --> 45:28.880
[Carrie]
Thank you, sir.

45:28.964 --> 45:31.550
- Hello, Carrie.
- David.

45:31.633 --> 45:32.634
[Wellington] <i>We were just
discussing next steps.</i>

45:32.718 --> 45:36.138
<i>To catch you up,
Haissam Haqqani has agreed</i>

45:36.221 --> 45:37.389
in principle to the terms
and the timelines

45:37.472 --> 45:40.559
laid out
in the Doha Framework.

45:40.642 --> 45:43.020
Not only that,
he's committed to a ceasefire.

45:43.103 --> 45:43.895
That should buy us some time

45:43.979 --> 45:46.398
to hash out
the outstanding issues.

45:46.481 --> 45:49.818
One of which is to sell this
peace to the American people.

45:49.901 --> 45:53.030
<i>Well, I think the prospect
of ending our longest war</i>

45:53.113 --> 45:54.781
<i>would enjoy broad support.</i>

45:54.865 --> 45:57.826
Well, not when it's twisted
into a partisan issue

45:57.909 --> 45:59.995
made to look like we're
capitulating to terrorists.

46:00.078 --> 46:03.331
<i>Seeing as you were one of
the architects of the policy,</i>

46:03.415 --> 46:05.459
<i>we thought you might
have some ideas.</i>

46:07.586 --> 46:08.962
Well, I can tell you

46:09.046 --> 46:11.131
what Elizabeth Keane
was planning to do.

46:11.214 --> 46:13.258
<i>Get out in front
of the debate.</i>

46:13.341 --> 46:14.885
Come here to Afghanistan
and make the case

46:14.968 --> 46:16.428
directly to the men and women

46:16.511 --> 46:19.264
who put their lives
on the line every day.

46:19.347 --> 46:21.641
You're talking about
taking a secret trip,

46:21.725 --> 46:24.019
making a surprise announcement?

46:24.102 --> 46:25.020
<i>Followed by
a joint press conference</i>

46:25.103 --> 46:27.939
<i>with President Daoud
at the Arg Palace.</i>

46:29.024 --> 46:29.775
Hmm.

46:29.858 --> 46:31.359
I'm just saying,
win over the military,

46:31.443 --> 46:33.904
and you're halfway there.

46:33.987 --> 46:35.989
[Carrie] <i>It also has
the benefit of good optics.</i>

46:36.073 --> 46:37.991
Flying into a war zone,
rallying the troops,

46:38.075 --> 46:39.659
and not looking anything
remotely like surrender.

46:39.743 --> 46:43.538
<i>Sounds like you've made
this argument before.</i>

46:43.622 --> 46:46.249
[chuckles]
I have, sir.

46:46.333 --> 46:49.377
<i>Well, I appreciate
the bluntness.</i>

46:49.461 --> 46:51.630
<i>Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like a few minutes alone</i>

46:51.713 --> 46:53.924
<i>with my
National Security Advisor.</i>

46:54.007 --> 46:55.467
Yes, sir.

46:55.550 --> 46:57.385
[Wellington]
<i>Saul, Carrie...</i>

46:57.469 --> 46:58.804
[Warner]
<i>Thank you, David.</i>

47:00.305 --> 47:03.642
<i>Talk to me, Saul.</i>

47:03.725 --> 47:05.727
[Saul] Well, sir, the best part
you've already heard.

47:07.395 --> 47:09.481
[Mike]
Hey, slow down.

47:09.564 --> 47:10.690
What's the hurry?

47:10.774 --> 47:13.318
I want to write up
the contact with Yevgeny

47:13.401 --> 47:15.112
while it's still fresh.

47:15.195 --> 47:15.862
Where'd you disappear to?

47:15.946 --> 47:17.656
- [door closes]
- I'm sorry?

47:17.739 --> 47:18.323
If you're so eager
to write up the contact,

47:18.406 --> 47:19.825
where'd you go afterwards?

47:19.908 --> 47:22.744
You were off the grid
for more than 90 minutes.

47:22.828 --> 47:24.412
I was walking.

47:24.496 --> 47:25.956
Walking?

47:26.039 --> 47:28.625
[sighs]

47:28.708 --> 47:30.335
It wasn't so easy
seeing him again,

47:30.418 --> 47:32.462
if you must know.

47:32.546 --> 47:34.881
I went up to the university
to clear my head.

47:34.965 --> 47:37.175
You said he was recruitable.

47:37.259 --> 47:38.176
Is he?

47:38.260 --> 47:39.719
Just give me an hour,

47:39.803 --> 47:42.514
and you'll have the entire
conversation verbatim.

47:42.597 --> 47:44.224
It's a simple question, Carrie.
Yes or no?

47:44.307 --> 47:48.395
<i>[♪ tense music ♪]</i>

47:48.478 --> 47:51.481
He's feeling
underappreciated, okay?

47:51.565 --> 47:53.316
He and Mirov were demoted
for letting us

47:53.400 --> 47:55.068
get Simone Martin
out of Moscow.

47:55.152 --> 47:57.070
We made them look
pretty damn silly.

47:57.154 --> 47:59.197
He said that?

47:59.281 --> 48:01.950
Not in so many words,

48:02.033 --> 48:04.995
but he did call Afghanistan
the penalty box.

48:05.078 --> 48:06.580
<i>[♪♪♪]</i>

48:06.663 --> 48:10.083
Well, that doesn't sound
unpromising.

48:10.167 --> 48:12.544
Provided it's not all
some grand deception.

48:13.962 --> 48:17.048
- Where'd you leave it?
- In his court.

48:17.132 --> 48:18.258
Either way, I don't think

48:18.341 --> 48:20.010
I should be getting
on a plane anytime soon.

48:20.093 --> 48:22.429
[sighs]

48:22.512 --> 48:24.556
How about we talk
after I read the report?

48:24.639 --> 48:26.892
Sure.
