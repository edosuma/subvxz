WEBVTT

02:52.631 --> 02:55.043
— Hurry up, girls.
— Nearly ready.

02:55.176 --> 02:58.009
— You have too much metal on you.
— It's not so much.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.219
I'm a magistrate, not King of Asia.

03:00.348 --> 03:04.967
Give one to your sister.
Give one to your sister!

03:06.729 --> 03:10.062
Please stop fussing and put that veil on.
We'll be late.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.572
— Patron, | kiss you.
— Mabinio, you honour me. What is it?

03:19.700 --> 03:23.363
Well, I'll go straight at it then.

03:23.496 --> 03:26.738
My piss pots were all broken
this past nine day.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.578
Soldiers, naming no legions,

03:29.710 --> 03:32.201
thought it funny to tip them out
over honest citizens.

03:32.338 --> 03:35.796
Now, now, who's to say it was soldiers?

03:35.925 --> 03:38.917
Might have been gladiators simulating.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.918
I know soldiers when | see 'em.

03:41.055 --> 03:45.048
Not as I'm prejudiced.
Most soldiers are good men, like yourself.

03:45.184 --> 03:48.551
— But there's a lot of foreign element...
- It won't happen again.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.771
I should hope not.
Roman citizens that need and deserve respect

03:52.900 --> 03:55.437
and get drenched in piss instead!

03:55.569 --> 03:59.812
There's not a drop left!
How am | to make cloth without piss?

03:59.949 --> 04:03.737
— How am I supposed to make...
— It won't happen again.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.200
Thank you, patron. Minerva keep you.

04:11.544 --> 04:14.286
Brother Mascius.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.959
Brother Vorenus.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.673
- Big man now?
— You're not so small.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.588
These Roman bitches.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.963
I've done nothing but fuck
and eat and fuck since I got here.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.637
We're not under goatskin now, brother.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.101
No disrespect to your women?

04:32.815 --> 04:37.149
I am pleased to speak with you more, Mascius,
but I must see to my clients first.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.145
They are upset if not received
in their proper order.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.988
Of course, of course.

04:43.117 --> 04:46.905
Excuse my crude soldier's ways.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.999
— What brings you here, Mascius?
— Just seeing how you do.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.673
Which is good, looks like.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.093
— But where's old Titus Pullo?
— I don't know. I haven't seen him.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.184
Gerrae! You and Pullo
were like Castor and Pollux.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.645
Pullo's dead to me.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.316
Well, I'm glad to see you're doing so good.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.283
— How's our old chief?
- Well.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.406
Good, good.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.663
I'll not lie.

05:36.795 --> 05:41.539
Your brothers are unhappy. They feel
the old chief's forgot who brung him here.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.758
They cannot have more coin.
There is an agreement.

05:44.887 --> 05:48.630
There is. There is. And it's adequate coin.

05:50.351 --> 05:54.060
- Got his picture on it now, | see.
— A coiner may depict what he likes.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.645
Fact is, our brothers
need more than just money

05:56.774 --> 05:59.732
if they're to lead honourable
and peaceful lives.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.603
Money runs out one day,
then what do they do? What?

06:03.739 --> 06:08.073
They need to take up a trade, maybe?
It's unlikely. What are they to do?

06:08.202 --> 06:11.660
Do not pose questions at me, brother.
Speak directly.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.201
We want land in Italy.

06:14.333 --> 06:19.043
Caesar will give all veterans land when he can,
as he promised he would, but not in Italy.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.503
Caesar gave you land in Italy.

06:21.632 --> 06:27.252
I am a magistrate, and he must have
an income. But I am one man, not legions.

06:27.388 --> 06:32.257
- Must be lovely.
— I haven't seen it yet. I'm too busy.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.385
Of course. Busy, busy.

06:37.648 --> 06:41.266
— We don't want to be unreasonable...
— Then don't be.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.484
We have an agreement.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.697
Talk it over with your man.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.489
— Mars and Bellona keep you.
— And you.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.479
Cave, Chief.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.516
Salve, Pullo.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.100
How goes it?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.232
Want some mouse?

08:09.365 --> 08:13.654
— You should. They do 'em savoury here.
— Best mouse in the city.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.493
Do you have some work for me?

08:17.539 --> 08:21.031
— Always somebody needs mortality.
— Give me a name.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.251
Trouble is, my honey, you want discretion.

08:24.380 --> 08:27.872
This last job? You ran that poor scurra
up and down the Aventine

08:28.008 --> 08:31.125
like Justice chasing chickens.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.388
Might as well have done it in the Forum.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.675
— I'll go quiet next time.
— I don't know.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.799
l have my reputation to think of.

08:37.935 --> 08:41.644
People come to me for mortality work
because my men are reliable.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.763
That's right. Reliable men.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.481
I'll be quiet as death next time.

08:49.822 --> 08:53.314
Come back tomorrow, same time.
Urbo will take you to your man.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.615
Give me some money on spec.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.879
Not here.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.889
This is a respectable place
for decent citizens.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.849
What would they have me do?
I cannot make farmland.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.394
Certainly you can. It's called eviction.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.517
— And who shall I evict?
— Your enemies.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.941
— Enemies? l have enemies still?
- Strange to say.

09:33.073 --> 09:37.112
- I shall make friends of them in time.
— And make enemies of your veterans...

09:37.244 --> 09:38.950
unless something is done.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.286
Is it possible they turn on me?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.531
They would never fight against you,

09:43.667 --> 09:47.751
but if they are not satisfied,
they will turn to banditry and raiding.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.542
In your name. Not good.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.675
Tell Mascius

09:54.803 --> 09:57.340
I respect his honesty.

09:57.473 --> 10:01.011
Tell him my veterans are as sons to me,

10:01.143 --> 10:04.852
and to all loyal veterans
I shall give good lands in...

10:06.064 --> 10:09.602
Pannonia. Good fertile bottomlands.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.151
— Pannonia?
— Speak freely.

10:14.573 --> 10:18.657
It's hard country, Pannonia, and far away.
Mascius will refuse it.

10:18.786 --> 10:23.655
Does Mascius have the men's full trust?
Can he sway them either way?

10:23.791 --> 10:27.750
He can sway the 10th men, and what
the 10th men do will sway other legions.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.244
Make him a personal offer, then.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.335
— To what limit?
— You be judge of that.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.380
Oh, Magistrate Vorenus...

10:38.514 --> 10:41.426
my niece is holding
a symposium next market day

10:41.558 --> 10:45.346
and I should like you and your wife
to come as my guests.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.346
— We are honoured, sir.
— You look troubled.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.184
My wife and l are simple people, sir.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.483
No matter. You shall get used to good society.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.673
How is it?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.385
Much more comfortable.

11:20.514 --> 11:24.257
I don't think my back could take
another of Cicero's eulogies.

11:24.393 --> 11:28.011
No, he praises you so long and high,

11:28.146 --> 11:30.558
one might think he was being sincere.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.771
— Salve, Magistrate.
- Salve, citizen.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.448
My husband's home.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.443
It was so good of you to visit.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.415
Not at all, I'm sure.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.033
Please come again.
I'd be so happy to receive you.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.798
Thank you.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.260
Desist that now.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.677
Receive us, she says.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.891
— I would...
- Ladies.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.307
Magistrate, sir.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.476
— Husband...
— What are these now?

12:17.613 --> 12:21.526
Leased, and at very good rates too.
And don't they look impressive?

12:21.658 --> 12:24.240
Put some more cloth on 'em.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.530
You look tired.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.700
— Why don't you lie down?
- | wish I could.

12:34.338 --> 12:37.375
"By claim of the Senate and people,

12:37.507 --> 12:40.715
"our beloved father, Gaius Julius Caesar,

12:40.844 --> 12:44.587
"has been declared dictator for life.

12:46.683 --> 12:52.599
"Furthermore, the fifth month
is henceforth named July in his honour."

12:58.320 --> 13:00.561
Erase that.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.272
Cassius.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.990
It will do no good.
The image is on every wall, on every hill.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.740
Don't worry about scribbles.
King Caesar knows you're loyal.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.912
I'm not worried about that.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.787
No, it's just, do I truly look like that?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.709
It's near.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.833
Well, that's tragic.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.461
But an image cannot catch your vim,

13:25.597 --> 13:27.838
your noble vitality.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.511
I speak only what's true.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.510
You have that grace in action
your noble ancestor had.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.012
Plebs put you on walls
as they see him in you.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.525
They see my wretched name, that's all.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.859
Simpletons. Let us speak of something else.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.569
There's weight in names, isn't there?

13:42.698 --> 13:46.657
You may call a cat a fish, but it will not swim.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.703
The plebs love liberty. In your name, they...

13:51.832 --> 13:54.448
They would not pluck a hair for liberty.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.996
Plebs like to see their betters fight.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.495
It's cheaper than theatre and the blood is real.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.247
Come here with me.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.754
Look, now. Look at that.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.054
It is a chair. What of it?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.563
Chair? It's a throne!

14:15.689 --> 14:19.432
I believe thrones are
generally more decorative.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.435
That is decidedly plain and chairlike.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.653
— Are you blind?
— Do not be hysterical.

14:24.781 --> 14:29.024
— Your mother said you were a coward.
- My mother is very unhappy.

14:30.328 --> 14:36.244
- Forgive me. I spoke in anger.
— I am no coward, nor am | blind.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.753
I know what Caesar is.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.744
I can see.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.213
But I have pledged myself his friend.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.548
No, I am his friend.

14:46.470 --> 14:50.383
So, for friendship,
you would let the Republic die?

14:50.515 --> 14:53.257
lam just a man.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.352
The life or death of the Republic
is not in my hands!

14:58.398 --> 15:00.514
You are precisely wrong.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.562
The Republic is in your hands.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.655
The people will not accept a tyrant's death

15:08.784 --> 15:10.695
unless a Brutus holds the knife.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.494
Now you have gone too far.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.948
He has to die.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.623
You know him.
You know he'd never accept exile.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.371
He has to die.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.592
Wait, friend. Wait!

15:52.994 --> 15:55.246
How's that Gaulish cunny, then?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.537
Greasy, I bet.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.783
Don't talk unless I tell you.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.048
There, in the middle. Aufidius.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.312
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

16:36.163 --> 16:38.324
He killed Aufidiu!

17:16.745 --> 17:18.326
Pannonia?

17:18.455 --> 17:22.118
— Pannonia is 900 miles away.
— More like 600.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.992
ln Germania, practically.
It's not even provinced.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.416
Soil is black and deep, they say.
Tall forests, full of game.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.836
Full of Teuton raiders and
Dacian bandits and who knows who?

17:31.968 --> 17:35.802
Our brothers don't want any more fighting.
They won't have it.

17:35.931 --> 17:40.345
If our brothers accept Pannonia,
Caesar will be extremely grateful to you.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.347
- How so?
— 5,000 denarii.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.105
— I don't understand you.
— I think you do.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.943
l have been true to my brothers
since I first spilled blood.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.107
You think I will betray them for 5,000 denarii?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.526
- Seven, then.
— It might be 20,000.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.573
— I am not so greedy as some.
- Not so greedy as who?

18:00.705 --> 18:04.243
l merely say that my honour
is not for sale so cheap.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.411
In favouring Pannonia,
you would not betray our brothers.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.085
If they will not have Pannonia,
they will have nothing.

18:13.218 --> 18:17.382
— Men with swords never starve.
- But they still die, captains first.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.352
12.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.495
I'll be away then, brother.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.918
— Good to see you.
— And you.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.720
— Has that man gone?
- He has.

19:06.855 --> 19:10.143
- Is this all right?
— You look beautiful.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.984
I'm so scared I can hardly breathe.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.361
It will be fine.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.654
My dear girl, I have enough to worry about.
I will not be fearful of graffiti.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.493
I'm telling you, the scribblers are not wrong.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.489
— Brutus will betray you.
- You seem very sure.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.493
His mother will compel him.
She will not rest until you are dead.

19:31.629 --> 19:36.874
I well imagine poor Servilia is not
very fond of me, but really, wants me dead?

19:37.010 --> 19:41.379
— Atia, you're a dramatist.
— Well, I've warned you. I'll say no more.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.674
I've warned him.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.559
You're far away.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.182
Somewhere pleasant, I hope.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.019
— It's all one.
— So they tell me.

19:59.574 --> 20:02.236
I need your help.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.282
Your mother is a vicious
and heartless creature,

20:06.414 --> 20:08.655
but I find I am...

20:08.792 --> 20:11.784
wretched without her.

20:11.920 --> 20:17.961
I have done my best to sway her,
but still she shuns me like a leper.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.425
Refuses even to speak to me.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.262
Will you talk to her for me?

20:25.392 --> 20:29.180
Let her know how pitiful I have become?

20:32.107 --> 20:33.893
There's no need.

20:34.025 --> 20:37.062
Her disdain for you is an act.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.311
She is entirely infatuated with you.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.109
That is a wicked, foolish lie!

20:42.242 --> 20:44.107
Atia, let me speak with you...

20:44.244 --> 20:47.953
Daughter, that creature
over there by the door, who is she?

20:48.081 --> 20:49.992
The beauty in the vulgar dress?

20:50.125 --> 20:53.834
She's with Lucius Vorenus. His wife, I expect.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.795
It's so beautiful.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.130
They've even painted the ceiling.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.466
She has a wonderful tang of the street.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.630
Let me introduce you.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.547
— We should walk around.
- We should wait.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.344
— They're coming.
— Calm.

21:08.476 --> 21:12.845
Magistrate, my niece would like
to meet your lovely wife.

21:12.981 --> 21:16.940
- Honoured.
— Niobe, Atia.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.730
How did a grim thing like you
win such a flower?

21:19.863 --> 21:22.104
I found her when she was young and foolish.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.902
Would you entertain Niobe
while I speak with her fortunate husband?

21:28.037 --> 21:29.993
Delighted.

21:30.123 --> 21:33.160
Now, tell me, who on Gaia's earth

21:33.293 --> 21:35.750
— made this astonishing dress?
— I did.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.962
— You didn't.
— I did.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.207
What does Mascius say?

21:42.343 --> 21:45.335
He will accept Pannonia for 12.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.053
Very good.

21:47.182 --> 21:50.515
I did not think he would
sell himself so cheap.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.555
I must send you to negotiate
all my corruptions.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.270
I would rather not, sir.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.357
I spoke in jest.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.397
I understand.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.235
Please.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.698
You have corrupted one man

22:07.827 --> 22:10.534
and saved thousands from banditry.

22:11.748 --> 22:15.866
I often wish I were back in Gaul.
Warfare is pleasingly simple.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.870
— Vorenus.
— Magistrate Vorenus, if you please.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.917
He outranks you now, my boy.

22:22.050 --> 22:25.417
Excuse me, Magistrate Vorenus.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.214
I hear rumour among the servants

22:27.347 --> 22:30.805
that Titus Pullo is in the dungeons
awaiting trial for murder.

22:30.934 --> 22:34.176
— Is it true?
- It is.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.894
He has been hiring himself out as a knife man.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.139
He killed a man in broad daylight.

22:39.275 --> 22:43.393
— We must do something for him.
- We must do nothing.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.738
- Nothing?
— The man he killed was Aufidius Dento,

22:46.866 --> 22:49.653
Deputy Chief of the
Caelian Nailmaker's Association.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.153
Popular man, apparently,
and a vocal critic of my leadership.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.281
People will suspect I ordered his death.

22:56.417 --> 23:00.501
I must not confirm
those suspicions by helping Pullo.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.996
And did you...

23:03.132 --> 23:04.417
order his death?

23:04.551 --> 23:08.260
I did not know he existed until he didn't.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.754
I have no notion why he was killed.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.097
Public man like that, might be many reasons.

23:13.226 --> 23:17.765
I can't appear to be sending out my soldiers
to murder anyone who opposes me.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.057
I would lose support.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.771
Perhaps Vorenus and I...

23:20.900 --> 23:24.267
Nor can anyone associated with me help him.

23:24.404 --> 23:28.317
Has he any friends who will help him
find a lawyer to defend him?

23:28.449 --> 23:31.191
He is guilty.

23:31.327 --> 23:35.491
People must see justice done.
Soldiers have to learn they're not above law.

23:35.623 --> 23:40.117
I'm sorry, Vorenus. I know he is
brother to you, but there is no choice.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.833
It's all true.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.504
I think we can go now, unless you...

23:53.641 --> 23:57.099
Can we? It's very nice, but...

23:58.479 --> 24:00.344
I know.

24:12.994 --> 24:18.114
Castor. In the morning,
bring Timon the Jew here.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.753
— Good night, Mother.
— Good night, my love.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.138
I don't see what's wrong with it.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.705
Moses, you need law?

26:21.831 --> 26:24.447
Number one justice right here! Right here!

26:24.584 --> 26:26.825
Take me, boss! Top lawyer! Top lawyer!

26:26.961 --> 26:28.997
— You're good, are you?
- Good?

26:29.130 --> 26:32.668
I could have Medea acquitted.
What's your case?

26:32.800 --> 26:35.758
Man, name of Titus Pullo...

26:35.887 --> 26:38.845
- On your way, Jew.
— You don't want the case?

26:38.973 --> 26:41.760
I'd rather suck Pluto's thorny cock.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.677
Anyone?

26:48.566 --> 26:50.682
Anyone want work?

26:55.406 --> 26:57.271
Anyone?

27:12.757 --> 27:15.999
It would go much easier for you
if you said who paid you.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.548
- It shows penitence.
— I can't help you. Sorry.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.807
I gave my word.

27:23.601 --> 27:29.096
Perhaps you need the money
to help your sick mother or a friend in need?

27:29.232 --> 27:32.645
— Something like that would help.
— I needed money for wine.

27:37.573 --> 27:41.407
Have...have you any friends
that would speak for you?

27:44.247 --> 27:46.363
There must be someone.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.741
Good bread, this. Have you got any more?

28:02.807 --> 28:06.925
Titus Pullo, soldier, 13th Gallic Legion.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.393
Accused of homicide

28:09.522 --> 28:12.480
re citizen Aufidius Dento,

28:12.608 --> 28:15.520
Caelian Hill, tribe of Falerna.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.736
Brought to trial by his friends.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.110
Throw him to the animals!

28:22.243 --> 28:24.359
We begin.

28:24.495 --> 28:29.330
Who speaks for the corpse of Aufidius Dento?

28:29.458 --> 28:34.168
I...Maius Nigidius.

28:36.591 --> 28:40.083
Who speaks for Titus Pullo?

28:45.016 --> 28:47.382
Priscus Maevius.

28:47.518 --> 28:49.850
Accusator, proceed.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.810
Citizens, friends...

28:54.942 --> 28:57.854
when I was told
of the death of Aufidiu,

28:57.987 --> 29:00.273
I was deeply saddened.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.148
A good man, stabbed! Butchered!

29:04.160 --> 29:07.243
Hacked to death in daylight on a public street!

29:07.371 --> 29:09.783
Vicious scum!

29:09.916 --> 29:12.157
I was deeply saddened.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.000
But I was not surprised.

29:15.129 --> 29:18.121
These horrors have become commonplace.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.294
Wretched specimens like this

29:21.427 --> 29:24.294
— are common as rats.
— That's right!

29:25.389 --> 29:30.725
I will not take your time with
lengthy proof of his guilt. Look at him!

29:30.853 --> 29:34.220
It's not open to question.
We all know he's guilty.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.818
— Salve, brother.
— And you, brother.

29:48.955 --> 29:52.994
Not good, eh? What are you doing here?
I thought Pullo was dead to you?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.956
Dead to all, soon.

29:55.086 --> 29:58.203
Hard as adamant, you.
Well, you might be wrong, though.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.671
Many's the slip 'tween knife and altar.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.337
— What?
— Pullo is not alone.

30:07.974 --> 30:11.262
We'll not let any brother
be damned by this dirty mob.

30:11.394 --> 30:14.807
These dogs will be yelping louder soon.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.851
When they bring him down,
we'll go in and have him away.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.521
— Call them off!
- Why?

30:20.653 --> 30:23.019
Do you not understand what is at stake here?

30:23.155 --> 30:27.023
— Brother Pullo's life.
— Politically. What is at stake politically.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.196
Politically. I fuck politically in her fat arse.

30:30.830 --> 30:35.824
If Pullo is rescued by Caesar's men, people
will assume that he ordered Dento's killing

30:35.960 --> 30:39.544
— and Caesar will be held responsible.
— So? Caesar can do as he likes.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.537
He is re—establishing law and order.

30:41.674 --> 30:45.963
That won't work if his soldiers
are seen to kill citizens without consequence.

30:46.095 --> 30:48.086
— I can't call the boys off now.
— Why not?

30:48.222 --> 30:52.181
— Because it makes me look bad.
- You could look far worse.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.849
You would tell them?

30:59.025 --> 31:01.016
Iwill if I have to.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.821
Look at us, brother.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.031
How has it come to this?

31:11.662 --> 31:14.119
It is for the good of the Republic.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.364
It's a worthy cause, then.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.877
Just call them off.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.132
To add insult to injury, this soldier,

31:34.268 --> 31:38.728
this brute,
this barbarian from who knows where,

31:38.856 --> 31:40.596
refuses to name his paymaster!

31:40.733 --> 31:42.769
— Caesar!
— Caesar!

31:42.902 --> 31:46.986
We name no names, citizen. We cannot know.

31:47.114 --> 31:51.357
We might guess.
We might very well guess,

31:51.494 --> 31:53.109
but we cannot know.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.622
Which makes his crime even worse.

31:55.748 --> 31:59.457
Is there punishment enough
for monsters such as this?

31:59.585 --> 32:02.201
No!

32:02.338 --> 32:06.456
I think not. I think not.

32:07.927 --> 32:12.091
But perhaps my learned friend
can tell us otherwise.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.384
Priscus Maevius speaks.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.605
This man...

32:22.733 --> 32:26.021
is nothing but a helpless servant.

32:27.321 --> 32:30.939
A tool, a puppet.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.825
We should feel pity, not anger.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.787
Pity for his...

32:37.915 --> 32:39.701
Pity for his degradation.

32:39.834 --> 32:44.453
Wait. Do you claim him innocent?

32:44.588 --> 32:45.919
No, I'm simply saying...

32:46.048 --> 32:49.336
Well if you do not deny his guilt,
then we're done with him.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.801
— Do you deny his guilt?
— No, I do not, sir.

32:52.930 --> 32:59.426
Very well. Titus Pullo condemned
to death in the arena.

33:11.073 --> 33:14.736
You know I have always
looked on you as my son.

33:14.869 --> 33:17.326
Oh dear, one of those conversations.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.030
Good move.

33:21.167 --> 33:24.000
I have a favour to ask of you, father to son.

33:25.629 --> 33:31.374
I need someone to take over Macedonia
from that idiot Valerius.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.673
I would like to appoint you.

33:34.805 --> 33:38.047
— I govern Macedonia?
— If you will accept.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.721
Why by three Furies
would you want me to do it?

33:40.853 --> 33:43.344
You are the right man for the job.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.937
I can think of few men less right.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.153
You've always underestimated yourself.

33:50.279 --> 33:54.318
You might achieve great things
if you would but try.

33:54.450 --> 33:57.613
In Macedonia?

33:57.745 --> 33:59.861
I think not.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.122
I would ask you to reconsider.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.040
I need someone I can trust.

34:17.223 --> 34:20.636
— You need me out of Rome?
— Not at all.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.804
I need your help.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.521
Someone you can trust?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.641
Am I wrong to do so?

34:29.777 --> 34:32.109
— You have doubts, do you?
- I did not say that.

34:32.238 --> 34:35.355
Speak plain, I beg you.
Have I given you reason for doubt?

34:35.491 --> 34:38.733
Since you ask, you have, as you well know.

34:39.995 --> 34:44.113
— You speak of years ago.
— Old betrayals do not signify?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.332
I betrayed nothing.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.454
Had you told me
you were to march on Rome

34:51.590 --> 34:54.332
and asked me for my allegiance,

34:54.468 --> 34:56.129
I would have given it.

34:56.262 --> 34:59.129
I would havejudged you insane...

35:00.057 --> 35:03.641
But I would have given you my allegiance
because I look on you as my father.

35:03.769 --> 35:07.512
— Brutus...
— But you did not ask for my allegiance.

35:08.274 --> 35:12.643
You demanded it at sword point.
I betrayed nothing!

35:13.320 --> 35:17.814
Forgive me, I spoke too hot.
You have never betrayed me.

35:18.492 --> 35:21.404
— So why do you not trust me now?
- I trust you completely.

35:21.537 --> 35:26.873
So much so that you would send me
from Rome to govern Macedonia?

35:34.300 --> 35:36.791
Well, thank you.

35:36.927 --> 35:40.886
I am honoured, but I will not go.

35:47.354 --> 35:51.438
It is in my legal power to insist that you do go.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.359
As my father...

35:55.487 --> 35:57.694
As my father, I looked on you...

35:57.823 --> 36:00.485
For a year or 50, no more.

36:00.617 --> 36:04.075
- Until the city is stable.
— Forgive me. I feel unwell.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.367
— Perhaps we can finish this game later.
— Be reasonable!

36:07.499 --> 36:10.707
You're on every wall with a knife at my throat!

36:10.836 --> 36:13.293
I would be foolish to ignore it.

36:13.422 --> 36:17.916
Only tyrants need worry about tyrant killers.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.751
And you are no tyrant.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.004
Haven't you told me so many times?

36:23.140 --> 36:25.096
You may go.

36:54.129 --> 36:57.667
Janus, Gaia and Dis...

36:59.551 --> 37:04.215
I humbly beg you accept
this creature as my offering,

37:05.349 --> 37:07.715
and if it pleases you...

37:09.895 --> 37:13.228
I ask you to give Eirene long life.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.610
And same for my friend
Lucius Vorenus and his family,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.820
if it's not too much.

37:26.829 --> 37:30.037
And let Eirene know

37:30.165 --> 37:32.907
that I am sorry for what I did.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.169
Come on, soldier, up!

38:55.167 --> 38:57.158
Cave with this one...

38:59.338 --> 39:00.999
soldier.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.227
Come on, coward! Fight!

39:24.071 --> 39:26.437
— Stand up and fight.
- I don't want to.

39:27.783 --> 39:31.446
That's not how it works.
You're supposed to resist.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.445
Not if I don't want to.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.321
Ijust want to die, all right?

39:36.458 --> 39:38.824
So come ahead and kill me
and be done with it.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.792
Bollocks. Move!

39:40.921 --> 39:43.287
What's wrong with you?
Where's your dignity?

39:43.423 --> 39:45.414
Get up and fight!

39:49.221 --> 39:52.088
— Soldier. Wake up!
- Get up!

39:52.224 --> 39:55.341
Why don't you come here
and suck my cock?

39:55.477 --> 39:57.593
Look, just hold your sword.

39:57.729 --> 40:01.096
Just stand up and hold it, that's all.
You don't have to run about.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.565
You're naught but a bloody molly.

40:03.694 --> 40:08.279
You and the whole 13th!
Naught but bloody mollies.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.068
Don't talk of the 13th.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.285
Aye? I piss on the 13th!

40:15.414 --> 40:18.781
Pig spawn, all of 'em.

40:22.879 --> 40:27.669
Why don't you and the 13th
all line up and suck my...

40:33.557 --> 40:34.763
Pullo!

41:17.934 --> 41:20.141
13!

44:57.070 --> 45:00.562
Pullo! Pullo!

45:10.625 --> 45:13.492
— In autumn, they disappear.
— Who?

45:13.628 --> 45:16.005
Eels, they all disappear.

45:16.131 --> 45:18.167
— That so?
— Where?

45:18.300 --> 45:21.167
- Where what?
— Well, where do they go? The eels?

45:21.303 --> 45:25.216
That's what I'm saying.
Nobody knows. It's a mystery.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.598
Was expecting you time ago.

45:34.608 --> 45:37.224
If we employ you again, next time,

45:37.360 --> 45:39.851
best not use veterans.

46:10.936 --> 46:13.222
Mother?

46:13.355 --> 46:16.472
I owe Caesar no more friendship.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.974
I must do my duty.

46:39.798 --> 46:42.005
I'll speak to Cassius.

46:43.218 --> 46:45.300
See what can be done.
