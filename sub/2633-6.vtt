WEBVTT

00:05.797 --> 00:07.464
- Okay.
- Aah.

00:08.299 --> 00:12.261
Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you
are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.513
- Right, and when is that due?
- First of the month.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.222
And that's every month?

00:16.891 --> 00:19.101
No, just the months
you actually want to live here.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.519
Ah.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.896
Okay, here's the phone bill.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.899
Oh, my God!

00:26.693 --> 00:28.527
That's our phone number.

00:29.988 --> 00:33.407
Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.994
- So why don't I just cover you for a while?
- No, no. No way.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.831
Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...

00:41.124 --> 00:42.624
...anymore.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.961
- It's not charity, Joe.
- No, forget it.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.672
Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.383
All right? I can take care of myself.
Now, what's next? Come on.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.594
Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.472
- This is how much we pay for electric?
- Well, yeah.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.937
So we'll do the rest
of the bills later, then?

01:43.686 --> 01:45.687
So is Joey gonna have to give up
the apartment?

01:45.855 --> 01:48.565
I hope not. I tried to offer him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.192
How much do you think he needs?

01:50.360 --> 01:53.070
I figure $1500 would cover him
for a few months, you know...

01:53.238 --> 01:56.240
...but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

01:56.407 --> 01:59.159
Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him
as an actor?

02:00.411 --> 02:04.456
You could have him dress up
and put on little skits whenever you want.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.877
Well, that would help the pride thing.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.591
Wow, you look great.
Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?

02:15.885 --> 02:17.636
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.472
What do you girls
have planned for tonight?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.392
Instead of being sad
that tonight's my last night with Rachel...

02:23.560 --> 02:25.394
...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:

02:25.562 --> 02:27.229
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.607
- And also my birthday. Ha, ha.
- It's not your birthday.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.860
What a mean thing to say.

02:33.027 --> 02:36.155
I would never tell you
it was not your birthday.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.407
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.035
Hey, so you guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

02:42.203 --> 02:45.956
Well, instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.459
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Knicks' season opener tonight.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.129
I thought maybe you guys
would come and watch it.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.839
I don't know, Ross.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.258
Not if you talk about
how you gave up basketball...

02:56.426 --> 02:57.885
...to become a paleontologist.

02:58.052 --> 03:02.639
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.642
- Pheebs, I was wondering...
- You're not dressed yet?

03:05.935 --> 03:08.604
We're supposed to start having fun
in 15 minutes!

03:09.647 --> 03:12.608
Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.945
Rachel, you are packed, though, right?
I mean, please tell me you're packed.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.449
Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.076
I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion
on what I should wear.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.829
My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.668
Oh, my God.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.756
Monica's just gonna kill you.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.132
I know.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.468
What you're wearing is fine for that.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.849
You're not packed!

03:46.017 --> 03:48.435
You're not packed even a little bit.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.812
Surprise.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.983
Don't get mad,
because, look, this is what happened.

03:55.151 --> 03:59.029
So I started packing, and then I realized,
"What am I doing?"

03:59.197 --> 04:02.074
I am lousy at packing, right?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.825
But you love packing.

04:03.993 --> 04:08.038
So as a gift to you on our last night...

04:08.706 --> 04:10.249
Ta-da.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.503
I'll be coordinator.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.838
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.173
Oh.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.176
Look, everybody has to help.
Phoebe, you can help, can't you?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.719
I have plans.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.639
- You have plans with us.
- That's right.

04:26.349 --> 04:30.269
All right. Chandler can make boxes,
Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.396
- Tell the guys they have to help out.
- Okay.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.856
- Okay.
- My God, thank you.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.860
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack.
She's got jobs for everyone.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.697
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.032
Okay.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.577
The movers will be here in 11 hours.
Rachel has not packed.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.705
Now, everybody has to help. Chandler...

04:49.872 --> 04:52.374
No, I have plans with Joey.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.545
- I thought you said you were doing nothing.
- Yes, but for the last time.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.798
Okay, fine. Now, Ross...

04:59.966 --> 05:02.384
- Oh, but I can't do it.
- Why not?

05:02.552 --> 05:06.179
- Don't you have Ben?
- Because I have Ben.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.766
It's almost 8:00, it's almost past
his bedtime. Where is he?

05:09.934 --> 05:11.393
He's at a dinner party.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.565
Is he really coming?
Because I can see into your apartment.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.151
Of course he is. Uh, what?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.737
You think I'd just use my son
as an excuse?

05:21.904 --> 05:24.364
What kind of father do you think I am?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.116
All right. Sorry.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.661
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.711
Here it is.
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.380
I wish I'd known you were gonna do that.
I ordered Chinese.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.882
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.926
Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

05:45.094 --> 05:49.222
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...

05:49.390 --> 05:51.475
...you, the food of yours.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.604
Huh?

05:56.230 --> 05:59.107
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea
for what to do on our last night.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.110
What do you say we play a little,
uh, foosball for money?

06:02.278 --> 06:06.365
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.533
It'd be easier if you'd
just give me your money.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.118
Yes, it would.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.330
Ahem. What do you say to $50?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.624
- Okay, you're on.
- Okay, let's play.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.918
The big game. Italy versus...

06:18.086 --> 06:19.544
...China, apparently.

06:22.131 --> 06:25.801
Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.928
Oh, God.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.639
You remember when we got these?

06:31.432 --> 06:32.849
No.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.602
Oh, I guess you weren't there.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.232
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.235
Come on. Hey, ha, ha,
remember the time?

06:48.533 --> 06:49.991
You don't remember?

06:51.077 --> 06:54.496
Sorry, Pheebs.
I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.623
I'm gonna miss you so much.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.293
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad
though, you know?

07:00.461 --> 07:03.422
Instead of thinking about how much
you're gonna miss about each other...

07:03.589 --> 07:06.925
...you should, like, think about
some of the things you're not gonna miss.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.345
I don't think there's anything.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.556
Come on, there's gotta be something.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.308
Nope. She's perfect.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.188
I have one.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.775
Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.403
Uh, well, I guess
I'm not gonna miss the fact...

07:26.571 --> 07:30.574
...that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.538
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

07:36.706 --> 07:39.291
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.627
- Aw, sometimes.
- Ha, ha.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.713
Always, actually.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.925
Good. There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.554
It's not just the phone pen.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.724
It's just that I never get my messages.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.559
You get your messages.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.229
Well, I don't think it counts
if you have to read them off your hand...

08:01.397 --> 08:04.065
...after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.902
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

08:07.069 --> 08:08.737
Or your mom?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.614
Or Chandler?

08:10.781 --> 08:12.073
Or your mom?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.955
Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.125
- Yes.
- Ah.

08:22.293 --> 08:26.254
I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like,
500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoo!

08:26.756 --> 08:28.465
Man. Five hundred dollars.

08:28.633 --> 08:33.178
That is a lot of electricity, huh?
Woo-hoo!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.679
Ooh, I gotta buy some food.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.892
Okay, okay. Give me a chance
to win my money back. Sudden death...

08:39.059 --> 08:41.727
...one goal, $1000.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.772
- You serious?
- Oh, yes.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.440
Okay.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.484
- Get ready to owe me.
- Okay.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.944
Okay, here we go. Ready?

09:13.761 --> 09:15.470
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

09:15.638 --> 09:18.974
No one can beat me.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.565
See, now that's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.654
Hello?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.657
Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.577
Ooh, your brother. Score.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.914
- What's up?
- I'm here with Ben.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.749
Thought we'd say hi.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.753
- Put him on.
- Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.008
Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.678
Uh, he's smiling, though.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.015
Okay, talk to you later.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.316
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.986
Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.324
You know what else I'm not gonna miss?
"I'm Monica.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.869
I wash the toilets 17 times a day,
even if people are on it."

10:22.163 --> 10:24.956
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight? No?

10:25.124 --> 10:27.542
Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."

10:28.419 --> 10:31.963
"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages
from interesting people. Ever."

10:32.131 --> 10:33.632
Hey, I call her.

10:34.842 --> 10:40.388
"Oh, my God. I love Ross.
I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."

10:41.307 --> 10:43.099
"Oh, my God.
I can't find a boyfriend.

10:43.351 --> 10:47.520
So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall
and sleep with the first guy I find in there."

10:53.235 --> 10:57.405
Yeah, we should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.747
Still broken?

11:06.415 --> 11:08.041
It sucks, man.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.044
Your last night here, and I lose the two
most important things:

11:11.212 --> 11:13.505
The foosball table...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.507
...and $500.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.386
Well, you know, there are other ways
you can win back your money.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.180
- How about blackjack?
- Ah, not my game.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.808
Okay, uh, you know what?
We can play a new game.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.352
- A new game. It's fun.
- What's it called?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.230
Cups.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.235
- I don't know how to play Cups.
- I'll teach you. It's really easy and fun.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.529
- All right.
- Okay, here you go.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.782
I have two queens.
What do you have?

11:41.283 --> 11:43.535
- A two and a five.
- Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.790
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?

11:48.958 --> 11:50.166
Ooh!

11:52.002 --> 11:54.295
- What have you got?
- A four and a nine.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.464
You're kidding, right?

11:57.633 --> 12:00.343
- No. Why?
- Well, that's a full cup.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.556
Damn, I am good at Cups.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.268
I'm not talking to her.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.353
One of you has to take the first step...

12:10.521 --> 12:12.897
...and it should be you because
she's the one who's leaving.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.774
It's harder for her.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.235
Maybe you're right.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.946
But she made fun of my phone pen.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.866
I know. I took it hard too.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.997
Listen, Rachel,
I feel bad about what happened...

12:29.165 --> 12:31.666
- What are you doing?
- I'm unpacking.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.795
- What?
- I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?

12:35.963 --> 12:38.798
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.133
Hey, you know what?

12:40.301 --> 12:43.178
You're the one who wants this
big change and move in with Chandler.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.305
You should go.
Why do I have to leave?

12:45.473 --> 12:49.225
- Because It's my apartment!
- Well, it's mine too. What else you got?

12:50.478 --> 12:52.103
How about: You're moving!

12:53.481 --> 12:55.857
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.487
Okay, Monica...

13:02.865 --> 13:04.282
This is ridiculous.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.869
We should be packing you.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.874
- Hey, how you guys doing?
- Great. Monica's moving.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.460
I am not!

13:15.628 --> 13:18.671
Oh, really? Well, how come
all your stuff is in this box?

13:18.839 --> 13:22.258
Okay, you guys, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.053
Okay? You guys? Stop!

13:25.763 --> 13:30.433
I know that you're acting mad because
you think that will make it easier to leave.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.686
But deep down, you're still really sad.
Deep, deep down.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.105
- No, Phoebe, I am mad!
- Well, deep, deep, deep down.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.732
Yeah, I'm just mad.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.692
Then keep running.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.197
You win.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.991
- What did you have?
- Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...

13:47.159 --> 13:49.494
...a three and a six.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.871
That, my friend, is "D Cup."

13:54.041 --> 13:56.417
Okay, now,
how much have you won so far?

13:57.086 --> 14:00.088
- Wow. Seven hundred.
- Not 700 exactly?

14:00.422 --> 14:02.715
- Yeah.
- Heh. Double it.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.928
- What?
- Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...

14:07.096 --> 14:08.221
...you have to double it.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.933
- Really?
- Hey, I didn't make up the rules.

14:13.352 --> 14:18.189
Okay, so now, after you receive
the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.

14:18.357 --> 14:22.861
Now, that one card could be worth $100,
which brings your total to 1500.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.362
- Ooh.
- No, no, no.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.783
Don't get too excited, because that's not
gonna happen unless you get the... No way.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.038
Well, this is the last box of your clothes.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.166
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

14:38.627 --> 14:42.213
Funny, I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.927
Okay, you guys, I don't mean
to make things worse, but...

14:48.095 --> 14:50.221
...I don't wanna live
with Rachel anymore.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.974
- What?
- You're just so mean to each other.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.436
And I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.647
Well, Phoebe, that's fine
because I'm not moving.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.403
You know, I know I said
some bad stuff...

15:05.571 --> 15:08.740
...but Rachel does have some qualities
that make her a good roommate.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.366
Oh, really? Like what, Monica?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.955
You know how she has 147,000
pair of boots?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.790
Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.002
- She lets you borrow them.
- Yeah.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.880
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.259
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.304
She gets tons of catalogs...

15:31.472 --> 15:35.016
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages
of the things she thinks I'd like.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.852
- What else?
- Uh...

15:38.020 --> 15:39.979
When I take a shower...

15:40.356 --> 15:42.482
...she leaves me little notes
on the mirror.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.901
Yeah, I do. I do do that.

15:45.069 --> 15:49.155
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.826
When I fall asleep on the couch
after reading...

15:55.204 --> 15:57.038
...she covers me over with a blanket.

15:57.414 --> 16:01.167
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.507
And when I told her I was
gonna be moving in with Chandler...

16:08.509 --> 16:10.343
...she was really supportive.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.764
You were so great.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.851
You made it so easy.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.647
And now you have to leave.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.525
And I have to live with a boy!

16:28.570 --> 16:30.571
It's gonna be fine.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.575
Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait
to live with you.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.202
You know what we should do?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.746
Bring Monica, and then
we can all live there together.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.415
We'll have so much fun!

16:42.084 --> 16:44.293
But, honey, I think she's moving in
with Chandler.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.004
Oh, that's right.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.630
You're still set on that?

16:49.216 --> 16:50.842
Kind of.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.057
Oh, my God.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.438
Hello? Hey, Mon.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.815
How's the packing going?

17:05.983 --> 17:09.736
Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right...
Oh, my God.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.449
Get your head out of your shirt there,
son.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.034
What?

17:16.285 --> 17:19.328
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.708
Hey.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.210
- What's wrong?
- Ross and I were helping the girls pack...

17:26.377 --> 17:30.339
...took a little break.
I lost $1500 to him in Cups.

17:31.633 --> 17:35.011
Wha...? How did you lose at Cups?

17:35.179 --> 17:36.721
The same way you lost.

17:36.889 --> 17:41.267
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.229
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom. Ross gets a four and five.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.649
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup...

17:48.817 --> 17:54.572
...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile,
I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.948
Oh, man.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.201
He never played before either.

17:58.368 --> 18:02.288
You know what I think? I think
beginner's luck, very important in Cups.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.792
Let's just play one more hand.
One more hand.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.712
No, no more. I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.299
In fact, look. There's...
I wanna give you something, okay?

18:13.467 --> 18:16.302
And let me give it to you now
before I pawn it for Cups money.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.183
Now, I want you to have
the big, white dog...

18:22.351 --> 18:27.146
...as a... Kind of a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.775
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.402
It's "him." Not "it."

18:34.363 --> 18:37.115
Well, what if I bought it from you,
you know?

18:37.282 --> 18:40.451
And then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.328
Say $1500?

18:44.206 --> 18:47.917
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.294
You're trying to give me money again.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.463
When did I try to give you money?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.465
Before, over there with the bills.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.510
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.804
Okay, then we had a nice
last night together.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.558
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.563
Now, out of the blue,
you start with the charity thing again.

19:08.730 --> 19:12.525
I'm just trying to help you out, okay?
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.819
I will be okay. Look, Chandler.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.990
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself, okay?

19:19.533 --> 19:23.452
Look, I'm not gonna miss you
helping me out with money.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.080
The only thing I'm gonna miss...

19:26.415 --> 19:28.082
...is you.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.295
And now the dog.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.595
Hey.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.431
- Call me when you get there, okay?
- Okay.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.391
I'm really gonna miss you.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.442
Oh, I have your key.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.029
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

20:03.410 --> 20:07.663
Oh, God, this is silly.
I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.416
Bye, house.

20:15.964 --> 20:17.048
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.656
Hey.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.743
- She really left.
- I know.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.666
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.801
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.512
What the hell is that dog doing here?

21:09.017 --> 21:12.311
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.982
- And now you want that money back?
- Exactly.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.526
Chandler, what kind of idiot
do you take me for?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.904
It's not a real game. I made it up.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.241
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.118
At a fake game!

21:27.869 --> 21:30.663
Now, if you wanna try
to make some of it back...

21:30.831 --> 21:34.083
...I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.712
I am very good at Cups.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.174
Okay, now, I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.302
- No.
- Hmm.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.054
Let's see if it comes up this time.
