WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:04.939
Okay. Last chance to cram
before the test tomorrow.

00:04.939 --> 00:07.520
What are the periodic symbols
for table salt?

00:07.520 --> 00:09.900
S-A... L-T.

00:11.190 --> 00:14.140
I'm so glad Taylor and Ellen
are still friends.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.560
She is a hot girl's
parents' dream.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.770
There is no way

00:16.770 --> 00:19.440
Taylor is getting pregnant
hanging out with her!

00:19.440 --> 00:21.350
Yeah, the only trouble Ellen
might get into is exceeding

00:21.350 --> 00:23.140
the number of books you can
check out from the library.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.770
Do you want to come over on
Saturday for a Scrabble party?

00:27.770 --> 00:29.400
Uh...

00:29.400 --> 00:31.270
You could use the dictionary
and proper nouns.

00:31.270 --> 00:32.310
And...?

00:32.310 --> 00:33.980
Dirty words.

00:33.980 --> 00:34.940
I'm in.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.230
Um...

00:37.230 --> 00:39.020
Mr. and Mrs. Otto,

00:39.020 --> 00:40.940
is this almond milk
or regular milk?

00:40.940 --> 00:42.140
Regular milk.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.900
Can I use the restroom?

00:43.900 --> 00:45.140
Use the one upstairs.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.350
So...

00:50.350 --> 00:51.980
game night Saturday?

00:51.980 --> 00:53.600
Yeah, unless something
better comes up.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.690
Taylor, using Ellen as
a backup isn't very nice.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.140
I am trying to raise

00:58.140 --> 01:00.400
high-quality, non-sucky
human beings.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.850
Mom, I desperately
need these sneakers,

01:03.850 --> 01:06.730
so I'm gonna offer you a unique
opportunity to buy my love.

01:06.730 --> 01:09.140
Golden Goose sneakers.
Comfort.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.810
- Style.
- Sex appeal.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.810
We get it.
He wants the shoes.

01:12.810 --> 01:14.690
His grades have been solid.
How much are they, Oliver?

01:14.690 --> 01:17.060
A mere $480.

01:20.690 --> 01:23.440
Hey, Greg! I want a yacht!
What do you want?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.190
- I want a Lamborghini!
- I want...

01:25.190 --> 01:27.140
Okay, okay. I get it.
You can stop.

01:27.140 --> 01:29.940
No, it's still fun.
I want a diamond tiara!

01:29.940 --> 01:31.770
- Ooh! I want a scepter.
- We have scepters!

01:31.770 --> 01:33.690
Make sure you get one
with an ivory handle.

01:33.690 --> 01:35.730
- The others are garbage.
- Shut up, Cooper.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.690
The only reason
why you want these shoes

01:37.690 --> 01:40.690
is to impress your stupid
friends in this stupid town.

01:40.690 --> 01:42.640
Here's the contact info
for my dad's scepter guy.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.350
I'm AirDropping it to you.

01:44.350 --> 01:45.850
Oliver, the only way
you're getting these shoes

01:45.850 --> 01:47.100
is if you earn
the money yourself.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.270
And even if you did,
it would be insane

01:48.270 --> 01:50.270
to spend...
how much again?

01:50.270 --> 01:51.480
You just want to make fun of me.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.600
No, no, no.
I really forgot.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.770
$480.

01:59.690 --> 02:02.140
On shoes! We could wear
them on our private jet.

02:02.140 --> 02:03.310
Or we could take the helicopter.

02:03.310 --> 02:04.560
Helicopter?!
We have a helicop...

02:04.560 --> 02:05.690
Say it and die, Cooper.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.850 --> 02:17.640
How did I ever let you
talk me into these sneakers?

02:17.640 --> 02:18.980
They were BOGO...

02:18.980 --> 02:20.770
buy one, get one free
at Payless.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.520
Twinsies!

02:22.520 --> 02:25.770
I can feel the therapy bills
adding up with every step.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.850
- Howdy!
- Hi, Ellen!

02:29.850 --> 02:31.310
Hey, Tay!

02:31.310 --> 02:33.140
Ah, Taylor's popular friends.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.690
Westport's future housewives,

02:34.690 --> 02:37.690
or, as I call them,
The Blondetourage.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.600
They're too young
to just call them bitches.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.310
Tay-Tay,
that jacket is gorg.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.230
Those jeans are, like, beyond.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.770
Oh, my God!
Thanks so much!

02:45.770 --> 02:47.400
Come on, Taylor.
Do the right thing.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.230
Bring Ellen into the circle.

02:49.230 --> 02:53.560
Oh, no! The circle's closing!
Get in there, Ellen!

02:53.560 --> 02:55.560
Is she checking
the bottom of her shoe

02:55.560 --> 02:57.100
like she stepped in something?

02:57.100 --> 02:59.100
Oh, God!
She stepped in something!

02:59.100 --> 03:00.480
Do not smell it, Ellen!

03:01.690 --> 03:03.270
Ohh... Ellen.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.770
We're all hanging
Saturday. You in?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.980
Totally!

03:08.980 --> 03:10.730
What?!

03:10.730 --> 03:13.440
Taylor, I thought that you were
gonna hang with Ellen Saturday.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.480
I got a better offer.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.100
I can hang out with Ellen
another night.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.810
Her calendar is wide open.

03:18.810 --> 03:21.400
Taylor, not only do you live in
Sucktown, but you're its founder,

03:21.400 --> 03:23.400
and you own the diner
over on Suck Street.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.810
And you know how your
food tastes? It sucks!

03:25.810 --> 03:27.230
Can I dye my hair blond again?

03:27.230 --> 03:29.640
What conversation are you in?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.900
Okay, let me rephrase...
Do you think

03:31.900 --> 03:34.690
the founder of Sucktown
would look good as a blonde?

03:34.690 --> 03:38.640
See? Same conversation now.
Think about it.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.140
This town may have
corrupted my other two,

03:41.140 --> 03:43.520
but I still have my baby.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.770
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I didn't walk you in.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.270
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.730
Ever since you read
about electrical storms,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.600
you're scared to walk alone
in open spaces.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.140
I'm your lightning rod.

03:53.140 --> 03:55.440
I'm taller than you, and I've
got a mouthful of fillings.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.850
Yeah, but walking me in
is a lot of work for you.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.230
I don't mind!

03:59.230 --> 04:00.640
Oh, God, you're not
making this easy.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.850
Listen.

04:02.850 --> 04:05.440
I don't want you walking me
into school anymore.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.940
It's not you; it's me.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.900
Of course it's you.
You can't even read a clock.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.140
Okay. Lashing out.
I expected that.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.350
See you around.

04:22.310 --> 04:25.400
I have seen her through
all the tough times...

04:25.400 --> 04:27.350
the fear of water,
the fear of the basement,

04:27.350 --> 04:28.690
the ham-hiding.

04:28.690 --> 04:30.560
So that's why your couch
smells like that?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.730
No. Wish it were.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.140
And now she's tossed me aside,
like one of those husbands

04:35.140 --> 04:36.980
whose wives got them
through law school,

04:36.980 --> 04:38.560
and as soon as they
made partner,

04:38.560 --> 04:40.190
left them for someone better.

04:40.190 --> 04:41.850
I totally did that to Celeste.

04:41.850 --> 04:44.640
Man. She did not
see it coming.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.690
I like that side of you.

04:45.690 --> 04:46.810
On top of it,

04:46.810 --> 04:49.480
Oliver is becoming
more materialistic,

04:49.480 --> 04:51.310
and Taylor cares more
about dying her hair blond

04:51.310 --> 04:53.400
than her friend's feelings.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.140
And I ordered salad
like a dumbass!

04:55.140 --> 04:57.060
Angela, we're switching.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.310
No, you just took...
She just took my pancakes.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.560
Ha ha!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.400
Ugh.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.770
On the bright side, Taylor
does look better blond.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.900
Ugh! I hate how people
always think little blond kids

05:06.900 --> 05:08.600
are so cute
when it's just the hair!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.190
I mean,
Brittany Thompson's kids...

05:10.190 --> 05:12.730
have you looked at their faces?

05:12.730 --> 05:13.940
Have you?

05:13.940 --> 05:15.480
Guys, focus.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.600
This town is messing
with my family.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.270
- What do I do?
- Take a page from Angela's book.

05:20.270 --> 05:22.270
Don't worry about
other people's feelings

05:22.270 --> 05:24.230
and just do whatever it takes
to get the results you want.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.770
But learn from my mistakes...

05:26.770 --> 05:29.100
if you send someone a nude photo
and then ruin their life,

05:29.100 --> 05:31.060
whew, that sucker's going viral.

05:31.060 --> 05:34.310
Mm. This one...
totally retro.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.350
Why don't I just
buy them for you?

05:53.350 --> 05:55.060
You can't be my sugar daddy.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.060
I'm already riding bitch
on your Vespa.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.480
True, but you got to
step your game up, esÃ©.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.270
I need my wingman
looking on point.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.900
My dad said if I can pay
for them, I can have them.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.850
I just need to find a way
to make some money.

06:05.850 --> 06:09.100
Don't get a job at, like,
a market and embarrass me.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.230
No, man, I would never
do that to you.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.350
Mom?

06:16.350 --> 06:19.400
Stop looking at
those expensive shoes.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.440
How do you know where I am?
Are you in the bushes?

06:22.440 --> 06:26.310
I'm not hiding in the bushes.
I've stopped all that.

06:26.310 --> 06:29.020
I'm tracking you with the GPS
on your phone, dummy.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.440
You spy on me?

06:30.440 --> 06:31.730
Why do you think
I got you a cellphone?

06:31.730 --> 06:33.060
To be nice?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.850
R-I-i-ight.
That never added up.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.770
Mnh-mnh.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.560
So, Anna-Kat,
how are things?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.020
I'm getting the house
ready for a tornado.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.850
You don't have to
worry about tornadoes.

06:45.850 --> 06:48.560
Oh, yeah? Well, Mark Halloran
went out in a tornado

06:48.560 --> 06:50.940
and got decapitated
by his own boot.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.440
Katie, I thought we got rid
of all the disaster books.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.690
I thought so, too.
I guess we missed one.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.060
Anna-Kat, where did you
find this book?

06:59.060 --> 07:00.640
Under my pillow.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.140
Under your pillow?!

07:02.140 --> 07:04.020
That's why we couldn't find it.
It was hidden.

07:05.270 --> 07:07.520
Honey, you don't
need to do that.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.310
Mama is always going to
be here to protect you.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.940
How did this book
get under her pillow?

07:14.940 --> 07:17.730
Okay. I planted it so
Anna-Kat would need me again.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.850
Is that bad mothering?
Probably.

07:19.850 --> 07:23.350
Mama, maybe we should go back
to holding hands in open areas

07:23.350 --> 07:24.690
so I don't fly away.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.190
You're right.

07:26.190 --> 07:28.640
If Dorothy would've just
held onto Auntie Em's hand,

07:28.640 --> 07:30.600
all of that mess
could've been avoided.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.520
And that's a fact.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.560
Hey, Mom. Cute outfit.
You're looking hot today!

07:43.560 --> 07:45.100
She's just giving you
compliments

07:45.100 --> 07:46.560
because she wants
something from you.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.140
No, I'm not!

07:48.140 --> 07:51.400
Totally unrelated...
can I dye my hair blond?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.310
Remember how awesome I looked?

07:53.310 --> 07:55.400
Taylor does look good
with blond hair,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.690
just like those
rat-faced Thompson kids.

07:57.690 --> 08:00.690
But in parenting, no one
gets something for nothing.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.690
Okay.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.690
You can dye your hair blond.

08:04.690 --> 08:06.230
What? Really?!

08:06.230 --> 08:07.640
- That worked?
- Mm-hmm.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.140
Mom, are you using
a new night cream?

08:10.140 --> 08:11.480
Because your skin
is aye-yie-yie.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.140
I'm not buying you those shoes.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.980
You can dye your hair blond

08:15.980 --> 08:19.400
only if you start making
more adult decisions,

08:19.400 --> 08:22.230
such as being nicer
to old friends.

08:22.230 --> 08:24.140
Got it. When an
opportunity comes up,

08:24.140 --> 08:25.560
I'll be nicer to an old friend.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.520
But an opportunity has come up.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.690
Ahh.
Love you, old buddy!

08:32.690 --> 08:36.640
No, Taylor. Think.
Friends...

08:36.640 --> 08:39.059
Ellen... Saturday.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.940
Ellen...

08:40.940 --> 08:42.309
Saturday...

08:43.600 --> 08:45.270
This is something.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.520
Oh! Ellen.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.230
I was wrong to ditch her
after I made plans with her.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.060
So instead of hanging

08:53.060 --> 08:55.850
with Summit, Londyn,
and Zola tonight,

08:55.850 --> 08:57.350
you'll hang with...

08:58.940 --> 09:00.600
...ELLLL...

09:00.600 --> 09:02.100
I'll hang out with Ellen.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.640
Because of that
un-Westport response,

09:04.640 --> 09:06.520
you can dye your hair blond.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.270
Thank you!

09:12.900 --> 09:14.770
There's no way you're
blowing off that party.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.690
Duh. The girls and I
came up with a genius plan,

09:17.690 --> 09:18.980
so Mom will never know.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.440
The last time you came up
with a "genius plan,"

09:21.440 --> 09:23.770
you crushed up Cheetos
and put them in your soup.

09:23.770 --> 09:26.770
I say I'm hanging at Ellen's.
Zola says she's at our house.

09:26.770 --> 09:28.480
Summit says she's at Zola's.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.940
And Londyn will say
she's at Summit's.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.560
It's the perfect crime.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.520
You're as dumb
as your friends' names.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.100
Mom tracks you
by the GPS on your phone,

09:37.100 --> 09:39.520
and there's a good chance that
your friends' moms do, too.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.400
But there's a way around that,

09:41.400 --> 09:44.310
and all it will cost you
is 20 bucks a pop.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.310
Listen.

09:46.310 --> 09:48.270
Let's not put a price on this.

09:48.270 --> 09:50.270
We don't charge each other
for favors.

09:50.270 --> 09:51.730
We've got each other's backs.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.520
You're my brother,

09:53.520 --> 09:55.230
and we're gonna go through
everything together.

09:57.310 --> 10:00.270
Okay. After that nonsense,
I just raised the price to $30.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.350
Mama, the birds looked
a little nervous today.

10:08.350 --> 10:10.400
Maybe they know
something we don't.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.810
Maybe. Do you want to
sleep with me tonight?

10:12.810 --> 10:14.810
Just to be safe.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.400
Anna-Kat, could I have
a moment with Mommy?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.810
Sure.
I'm gonna go put

10:19.810 --> 10:22.230
some emergency rations
in the basement.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.400
Anna-Kat's tornado book
is from the library.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.310
It says it was checked out
yesterday at 3:15 p.m.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.440
Damn it!
Cops are onto me.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.770
So Anna-Kat went to the library.
Mystery solved!

10:36.770 --> 10:39.850
Didn't you go on a grocery run
about that time yesterday?

10:39.850 --> 10:42.400
I go on grocery runs
all the time.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.480
Yeah, but you insisted on
going to the far grocery store,

10:44.480 --> 10:46.770
which just happens to be
by the library.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.060
Mm-hmm.

10:48.060 --> 10:50.020
I had to pick up
a bunch of boxes

10:50.020 --> 10:52.310
of Anna-Kat's special
Fruit Roll-Ups.

10:53.310 --> 10:55.270
- A bunch of boxes.
- Yeah.

10:58.690 --> 10:59.980
Where are they?

11:01.350 --> 11:03.350
I ate them and
threw away the boxes

11:03.350 --> 11:05.060
because I was ashamed of myself.

11:06.350 --> 11:08.980
Thanks for making me feel worse!

11:08.980 --> 11:11.770
You went to the library,
you checked out this book,

11:11.770 --> 11:13.810
and you put it under
our daughter's pillow.

11:13.810 --> 11:15.980
This is why nobody wants to
play "Clue" with you anymore.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.020
You get all high and mighty
with the accusations.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.100
I have to get that.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.020
This conversation isn't over!

11:23.020 --> 11:25.560
Hey, Mrs. Otto!

11:25.560 --> 11:28.270
Sorry to disturb you, but
I brought this over for Taylor.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.730
It's my famous chicken soup.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.730
The secret ingredient...
friendship.

11:32.730 --> 11:35.690
Um, thanks, Ellen, but
I thought Taylor was with you.

11:35.690 --> 11:39.060
Oh, she canceled. She said
she was too sick to hang out.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.350
Wait.
Is she not here?

11:41.350 --> 11:42.730
No.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.140
Her GPS says
she's at your house.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.850
- Greg?
- Text her.

11:48.850 --> 11:51.270
"How are things going?"

11:52.440 --> 11:55.100
"Great. At Ellen's.

11:55.100 --> 11:58.600
Just spelled 'toe' on a
double-letter score. 4 points!"

11:58.600 --> 12:00.480
That's weird.
She wasn't at my house.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.600
And she rarely uses words
that exceed two letters.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.190
I'm sure there's an explanation.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.850
Do you mind looking after
Oliver and Anna-Kat

12:05.850 --> 12:07.230
while we figure this out?

12:07.230 --> 12:08.810
Sure, Mr. Otto,
but do you mind

12:08.810 --> 12:10.770
if I do some light cleaning
to take my mind off things?

12:10.770 --> 12:13.100
Oh, Ellen, you don't
have to do that.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.140
Turn on the TV and relax.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.310
Oh, my God.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.810
The GPS says she's right here
in Ellen's backyard!

12:27.810 --> 12:30.230
In the playhouse? I bet
she's in there with a boy.

12:30.230 --> 12:32.730
Finger's crossed
it's just heavy petting.

12:32.730 --> 12:34.140
You're crossing
your fingers for that?

12:34.140 --> 12:36.400
Oh, let's just get in there.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.230
Buenas noches,
Mr. and Mrs. Otto!

12:41.230 --> 12:43.900
What in hell are
you guys doing in here?!

12:43.900 --> 12:46.020
- Where's Taylor?!
- I can explain everything.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.480
Small businesses...

12:47.480 --> 12:48.980
...are the backbone of
the American economy.

12:48.980 --> 12:50.310
And like any patriot...

12:50.310 --> 12:52.480
You, the simple one...
talk!

12:52.480 --> 12:55.440
Oliver came up with this
really cool business idea.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.400
- Dude.
- No, they're gonna love it.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
You don't know them like I do.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.230
You see, kids these days
can't sneak out

13:00.230 --> 13:02.350
because their parents
track their cellphones.

13:02.350 --> 13:04.310
But for a small fee,
Oliver and I will hold

13:04.310 --> 13:06.190
your phone in a
parent-friendly location.

13:06.190 --> 13:08.100
- Ellen's house.
- Exactly!

13:08.100 --> 13:10.480
And if a mom or dad calls,
we'll text back for you.

13:11.770 --> 13:14.600
Ta-da.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.900
The only part I don't get

13:15.900 --> 13:17.980
is that your GPS says
you're at home.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.480
Who's covering for you?

13:23.480 --> 13:25.600
Ugh.
You're suffocating him.

13:29.730 --> 13:32.060
Got to give it up.
She really nailed my voice.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.190
You really thought of
everything, didn't you?

13:35.190 --> 13:37.270
- I see that you're angry.
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.270 --> 13:38.900
I feel like you're about to
squander the opportunity

13:38.900 --> 13:40.020
for an "I'm proud
of you, son" moment.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.270
You're so right.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.730
In exchange for leniency,

13:42.730 --> 13:44.980
I would like to cut a deal
by ratting out Taylor.

13:44.980 --> 13:47.310
Where is she?
At a concert

13:47.310 --> 13:49.520
in an abandoned warehouse
in North Branton.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.940
You... go home,
go straight to your room,

13:51.940 --> 13:54.190
- and wait for me in fear.
- What should I do?

13:54.190 --> 13:56.140
Go home, and no scepters
for a month!

13:56.140 --> 13:57.100
Aw, man!

14:03.900 --> 14:05.640
Taylor's somewhere inside,
but look at this line.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.310
How are we gonna get in?

14:07.310 --> 14:08.480
I have a thought.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.190
You're not flashing the bouncer.

14:10.190 --> 14:11.440
Then, I don't know!

14:11.440 --> 14:13.730
Maybe a tornado will
conveniently show up

14:13.730 --> 14:15.020
and scare everyone off.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.730
I don't like what you're
implying, Officer.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.060
Wait! I got an idea!

14:21.060 --> 14:23.190
This is an illegal
warehouse concert.

14:23.190 --> 14:26.350
All we have to do to get to the
front of the line is this.

14:28.810 --> 14:30.060
Cop!

14:30.060 --> 14:31.400
Cop? Cops where? Where?

14:31.400 --> 14:32.810
I'm not a cop.

14:32.810 --> 14:34.850
You know who always says,
"I'm not a cop"? Cops!

14:34.850 --> 14:36.520
- Cops!
- Cops!

14:46.850 --> 14:49.940
Taylor, I let you be blond so
you could fit in, and you have.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.060
You're now the Mayor of Sucktown,
and you won in a landslide!

14:53.060 --> 14:55.690
- Oh, congratulations!
- Here are your phones.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.190
I've already called
all your parents.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.560
Mom, I can't believe
you did that!

14:58.560 --> 15:00.310
- Mitzy's gonna.
- Mitzy should!

15:00.310 --> 15:01.560
And you want to know why?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.140
Because it's
extremely dangerous!

15:04.140 --> 15:06.230
You're 16-year-old
girls!

15:06.230 --> 15:08.520
You guys can't just go anywhere you
want without telling your parents.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.270
You could've been roofied!

15:10.270 --> 15:12.190
Katie, maybe we shouldn't be
yelling at somebody else's kids.

15:12.190 --> 15:13.350
That's what's wrong
with this country.

15:13.350 --> 15:15.640
People don't yell at
other people's kids enough.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.900
You could've been kidnapped,
shipped to Singapore,

15:17.900 --> 15:20.560
forcibly addicted to heroin,
and made to work in a brothel!

15:21.730 --> 15:22.770
That happens!

15:24.190 --> 15:26.400
What my wife is trying to say is

15:26.400 --> 15:28.100
the world is generally
a safe place,

15:28.100 --> 15:29.730
but it's good to be
aware of dangers.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.310
Have you all seen "Room"?

15:31.310 --> 15:33.270
- No.
- It seems sad.

15:33.270 --> 15:35.850
Of course it's sad!
But that's your future, ladies.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.520
If you keep acting up,
some old guy

15:37.520 --> 15:39.770
is gonna lock you up
in a shed somewhere,

15:39.770 --> 15:42.020
and your only friends are gonna
be Lamp and Bed and Wall!

15:43.690 --> 15:45.480
What my wife is trying to say is

15:45.480 --> 15:47.350
despite the depressing
subject matter,

15:47.350 --> 15:48.480
"Room" is a fantastic film.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.940
Brie Larson is a tour de force.

15:53.190 --> 15:56.310
Taylor, you are grounded
for the next month.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.310
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
W-What if we cut a deal?

15:58.310 --> 16:00.940
- Oliver already sold you out.
- Damn it!

16:00.940 --> 16:03.140
Ellen was your
first friend in Westport,

16:03.140 --> 16:04.690
the only one who would
give you the time of day,

16:04.690 --> 16:07.270
and you ditched her
for a better offer.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.480
Lying to us...
that's a teenage thing.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.230
Ditching Ellen...
that's a character thing.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.060
When I was in high school,
I was popular...

16:15.060 --> 16:17.310
like, so popular...

16:17.310 --> 16:19.900
but I was still nice
to everyone.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.230
Even the band nerds
and the drama losers.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.640
In fact, if I was
too cool for dweebs,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.270
you would've never been born.

16:26.270 --> 16:27.520
That's right.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.060
Now, go on.
Apologize to your friend.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.310
Hey, Ellen.

16:36.310 --> 16:38.810
Hey.

16:38.810 --> 16:41.270
Look. I'm sorry
I ditched you.

16:41.270 --> 16:42.980
You've been nothing
but nice to me,

16:42.980 --> 16:44.980
and lately I haven't
been a good friend.

16:44.980 --> 16:47.770
But if you're ever willing to
play Scrabble with me again,

16:47.770 --> 16:49.140
I'd like that.

16:50.350 --> 16:51.480
Too bad, Taylor.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.230
I have a little thing
called self-respect.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.770
And I've pretended "cray"
is a word for the last time.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.690
Enjoy your new friends
and your new hair.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.770
I'm sorry, Mrs. Otto.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.640
I took a toothbrush
and some hydrogen peroxide

17:09.640 --> 17:11.140
to the grout on the countertops,

17:11.140 --> 17:12.770
but I didn't have time
to do the island.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.440
It's okay, Ellen.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.980
You can come back Thursday.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.599
Upstairs, bedroom.
For the next four weeks,

17:22.599 --> 17:25.230
your only friends are gonna be
Lamp, Bed, and Wall.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.690
The disgraced Mayor of Sucktown
has been forced to step down.

17:32.690 --> 17:35.060
Now let's go talk to the
Governor of Suckachusetts.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.600
I like that.

17:40.270 --> 17:42.480
As punishment for lying to us...

17:42.480 --> 17:44.690
Now, wait a second.
I didn't lie to you guys.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.100
Taylor lied.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.810
As punishment for
helping Taylor lie...

17:47.810 --> 17:50.350
Now, Dad, again,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

17:50.350 --> 17:52.060
but I didn't "help" Taylor lie.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.560
She paid me.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.270
Does a baker "help" someone
who buys his bread?

17:56.270 --> 17:58.640
Does the butcher "help" someone
who buys his meat?

17:58.640 --> 18:01.140
Uh-huh. Does the father
"help" restrain somebody

18:01.140 --> 18:03.480
from strangling you
in two seconds?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.350
We don't want you to be
a materialistic jerk.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.980
And as punishment,
we're taking the money

18:06.980 --> 18:08.560
that you made from
your phone scheme.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.900
I thought we had a deal
for me ratting out Taylor!

18:10.900 --> 18:12.900
We did. I was going to
take your money and leave you

18:12.900 --> 18:15.020
on the side of the road where
you would end up kidnapped...

18:15.020 --> 18:17.640
And shipped off to Singapore
to work in a brothel.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.690
I think it's time you came up
with a new worst-case scenario.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.640
It happens!

18:23.690 --> 18:26.140
So, Katie, I think it's time
we had a tornado discussion.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.100
You're looking good.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.140
- No.
- Okay.

18:32.140 --> 18:34.690
I know I messed up
with Anna-Kat

18:34.690 --> 18:36.520
by giving her the tornado book.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.100
Yeah.
Why would you do that?

18:38.100 --> 18:40.900
Anna-Kat doesn't
need me anymore,

18:40.900 --> 18:43.980
and I was trying to figure out
a way to make her need me again.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.730
And what I did was wrong.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.140
Maybe next time you're
feeling that way,

18:51.140 --> 18:52.940
you'll come to me, and
we'll figure out something

18:52.940 --> 18:54.940
slightly less
completely cuckoo-pants.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.100
Besides, she'll always need you,
just in a different way.

19:01.310 --> 19:05.480
You're right.
I'll go talk to her.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.640
And you should probably
return this to the library.

19:08.640 --> 19:12.600
101 Household Killers."

19:12.600 --> 19:13.810
I know.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.400
Does that book talk about

19:24.400 --> 19:26.850
something called
"Tornado Alley"?

19:26.850 --> 19:28.690
Nope. What's that?

19:28.690 --> 19:30.100
It's the part of the country

19:30.100 --> 19:31.810
where almost
all tornadoes happen.

19:31.810 --> 19:34.640
Here. Take a look.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.690
And we're right here,
all the way over to the right.

19:38.690 --> 19:41.900
Huh. So it doesn't make sense
to be afraid of tornadoes?

19:41.900 --> 19:43.350
No, it doesn't.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.230
And I have to say,
I am so proud of you.

19:46.230 --> 19:49.400
You are growing up and
showing some independence.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.730
And if you don't want me

19:50.730 --> 19:54.230
to walk you into school anymore,
that's okay, too.

19:54.230 --> 19:56.600
Thanks for understanding, Mama.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.230
You're the best.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.600
- Mama?
- Yes, sweetie?

20:07.020 --> 20:08.270
Boundaries.

20:08.270 --> 20:10.060
Of course.

20:13.310 --> 20:14.640
It's awkward now.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.100
I know. Just try
to push through it.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.270
Wait!

20:23.270 --> 20:25.940
Before you dye my hair back,
can I do one last hair flip?

20:25.940 --> 20:27.560
Sure.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.850
Okay.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.400
Swish. Swish.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.100
Okay. I'm ready.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.400
You know what? You can
keep your blond hair.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.730
What?! Oh, my God!
Thank you so much!

20:44.730 --> 20:46.940
- With the following conditions.
- I'm listening.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.980
- One, no tattoos, ever.
- Okay.

20:49.980 --> 20:52.400
And, two, you will let me have
bagpipes at your wedding.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.020
Done! What's three?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.690
Ohh. I didn't have a three.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.730
Quick, Katie!
Think of something else!

20:57.730 --> 20:59.690
I get to dig through that bag
of Halloween candy

20:59.690 --> 21:02.690
in your closet
and take whatever I like.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.350
Sure!
You do that, anyway!

21:04.350 --> 21:06.850
Ohh! Wasted it!
