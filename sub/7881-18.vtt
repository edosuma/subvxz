00:32.542 --> 00:35.417
Where the hell's
my Red Dawn DVD?

00:35.458 --> 00:37.417
I told Steve
to alphabetize these.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.458
Oh, honey,
cut him a little slack.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.291
He just started
his first summer job.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.000
Why don't I alphabetize them?

00:44.041 --> 00:46.208
No! I asked Steve to do this.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.792
And he did a half-ass job.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.291
It may not seem important,

00:49.333 --> 00:51.709
but he needs to learn to do
everything with his full ass.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.000
Steve, there you are.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.667
I told you
to alphabetize the DVDs.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.125
And I can't find Red Dawn.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.125
Dad, can I unwind
for a minute?

00:59.166 --> 01:00.959
I'm walking in from
a hard day at work.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.291
Hard day?

01:02.333 --> 01:03.959
You work at a grocery store.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.500
You know
who actually works hard?

01:05.542 --> 01:06.625
Machines.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.792
Machines work non-stop
for years.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.041
I mean, take my watch.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.125
Where's my watch?

01:11.166 --> 01:12.750
You left it in the hotel room

01:12.792 --> 01:14.125
in Orlando last spring.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.333
Wow. You can go a long time

01:16.375 --> 01:19.125
without needing a watch.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.250
Dad, Red Dawn
is right here.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.208
It just got switched
with Red Sonja.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.583
No, I want you to
re-alphabetize these.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.458
Switching isn't
alphabetizing.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.667
What's the difference?
They're all in order now.

01:29.709 --> 01:31.291
What's the difference?!

01:31.333 --> 01:33.500
You do things the right way,
you have a good life.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.834
You do things the wrong way,
you end up riding the rails.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.125
What?

01:37.166 --> 01:39.000
Wh-What does that even mean?

01:39.041 --> 01:40.417
It means do it the right way!

01:41.542 --> 01:42.709
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:42.750 --> 01:45.375
I have a Father of the
Year award to accept.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.041
And the Pappy goes to...

01:48.083 --> 01:51.375
...my man, Stan Smith.

01:54.834 --> 01:56.250
Thank you, Alan Thicke.

01:56.291 --> 01:59.417
This is amazing.

01:59.458 --> 02:00.750
Honey!

02:00.792 --> 02:03.542
I told you I'm using
the garage for my award show!

02:03.583 --> 02:05.291
Park on the street!

02:05.333 --> 02:07.583
I am so sick of
this crap, Alan!

02:07.625 --> 02:10.291
You're ruining my thing!

02:15.250 --> 02:17.375
I'm sorry, it's over.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.291
But it's not you.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.250
You know that, right?

02:19.291 --> 02:20.250
It's not you.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.166
It's your body.

02:24.417 --> 02:25.959
Hey, knock that off!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.208
I'm dumping this girl,

02:27.250 --> 02:29.208
and your sad music
is making her cry.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.208
Uh, I don't think
it's the music, buddy.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.208
I do. In fact, I'm surprised
your crappy playing

02:34.250 --> 02:36.417
hasn't driven everyone
in this place to tears.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.792
Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't you come up here

02:37.834 --> 02:38.750
if you think you can do better?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.166
I don't even play guitar.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.792
But you suck so hard,
I bet I could

02:41.834 --> 02:43.125
be better than you in a week.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.166
Donald!
It's okay.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.375
Wait, if you don't play,

02:46.417 --> 02:48.375
why are you wearing a
Martin Guitar T-shirt?

02:48.417 --> 02:50.208
That's 'cause I'm
a hipster, dumbass.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.834
We pretend to be stuff.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.542
All right, Mr. Hip.

02:53.583 --> 02:54.792
Meet me back here in a week,

02:54.834 --> 02:56.125
and let's see who's better.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.875
Loser never shows his
face in here again.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.125
I'll do you one better.

03:00.166 --> 03:04.125
The loser never comes back
here even in a mask.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.000
See you in a week, Mr. Hip.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.291
See you in a week, um...

03:08.333 --> 03:09.333
Jamal.

03:09.375 --> 03:11.291
Your name's Jamal?
But you're white.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.166
So?

03:12.208 --> 03:13.500
Is this really the first time

03:13.542 --> 03:15.125
you've had this conversation?

03:15.166 --> 03:17.166
Come on, Jamal.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.834
What do you think's going on?

03:20.875 --> 03:22.375
Seems like everyone's
getting called

03:22.417 --> 03:23.750
into Bullock's office today.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.709
Uh-oh, I know that cry.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.125
Either they're
making budget cuts

03:29.166 --> 03:31.792
or all our parents got
in a car accident again.

03:31.834 --> 03:34.291
Smith?

03:34.333 --> 03:37.750
Sir, am I getting fired?

03:37.792 --> 03:39.208
I wouldn't say that.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.083
I'd say "sacked."

03:41.125 --> 03:43.709
Because that's more
what Austin Powers would say.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.625
I do a great Austin Powers
impression.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.792
You're sacked, baby!

03:48.834 --> 03:50.500
But I've worked here 20 years.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.417
You're just eliminating
the position?

03:52.458 --> 03:54.333
Oh, no, what you do
is important.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.709
I just found someone
who will do it cheaper.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.125
Meet Agent Gary.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.041
Gary's a half-wit.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.166
But he only costs half as much.

04:03.208 --> 04:07.041
Gary, stop rubbing
the stapler on your pants.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.250
So, that's it?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.709
I'm out of a job just like that?

04:13.750 --> 04:16.875
Yup, it's pretty crazy
how life can change so quickly.

04:16.917 --> 04:20.458
Here's another example of how
life can change so quickly.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.125
Ha-hey! Am I in time for a show?

04:29.166 --> 04:31.625
No, I challenged some dick
to a guitar duel.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.333
Now get out of here,
I need to practice.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.500
Go play in your attic
if you don't want an audience.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.083
Stairs.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.875
All right, how
hard could this be?

04:39.917 --> 04:42.166
The shape is pretty
self-explanatory.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.750
Roger, I-I thought you knew
how to play the guitar.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.250
I used to.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.959
But you know the part of your
brain that deals with music?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.458
I took some PCP and
just destroyed it.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.000
Hey, why don't you
order some DVDs

04:56.000 --> 04:57.959
from that Latin guy
with the infomercials?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.125
Lorenzo!

04:59.166 --> 05:00.875
That's genius, Hayley.

05:00.917 --> 05:03.542
Wonder how come I never
have any great ideas?

05:03.583 --> 05:05.500
I mean, could it be the PCP?

05:05.542 --> 05:06.583
Well, I don't know.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.500
Let's find out!

05:08.542 --> 05:11.458
Shoot, left my lighter
in the attic.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.291
Stairs.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.083
You know, Mr. Smith,
I'd like to give you the job.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.417
And the way you opened
an entire pack of Starbursts

05:21.458 --> 05:23.250
with your tongue
was really impressive.

05:23.291 --> 05:26.250
But I just don't think
you're qualified.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.250
But I've worked for the
CIA for the last 20 years.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.000
Yes, I see you put
that on your résumé.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.583
But it's not
on your permanent record.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.000
"Permanent record"?

05:36.041 --> 05:37.208
That's a real thing?

05:37.250 --> 05:38.834
Well, if it wasn't,
how would I know

05:38.875 --> 05:41.291
that in fifth grade you tried

05:41.333 --> 05:44.083
to get out of a math test
by putting a slice of pizza

05:44.125 --> 05:47.291
in your underwear
and saying it was your period?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.917
That's on there?!

05:48.959 --> 05:50.667
All right, first of all,
that never happened.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.000
Second of all, it was a calzone.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.542
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.083
But with a permanent record
like this,

05:55.125 --> 05:57.500
no one's going to hire you.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.041
Oh, you know what it must be?

05:59.083 --> 06:02.291
My CIA work isn't on there
because it's classified.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.333
Here, talk to my boss.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.834
Yeah, hi, this is Shaun

06:05.875 --> 06:07.834
over at Buffalo Wild Wings
corporate.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.709
I-I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm sitting here

06:09.750 --> 06:12.500
with a Stan Smith,
who claims he worked for you.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.625
He-he did?

06:14.667 --> 06:17.375
Oh, is that right?

06:17.417 --> 06:18.709
Okay.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.750
Eh, nice try, but that was
clearly one of your friends.

06:21.792 --> 06:23.291
He gave me the old
"Now that I told you,

06:23.333 --> 06:25.458
I'm gonna have to kill you"
joke.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.208
Hi, Stan.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.792
You got to stop
telling people, Stan.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.083
So according
to my permanent record,

06:35.125 --> 06:37.125
the last job I had
was in college

06:37.166 --> 06:38.291
sweeping up hair.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.625
Working at a barbershop
shows initiative.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.709
Barbershop?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.041
It was a White Castle.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.875
I finished raking
all the leaves.

06:44.917 --> 06:45.917
Did you clean the gutters?

06:45.959 --> 06:46.959
There was nothing in them.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.041
Then get a ladder and go up

06:48.083 --> 06:49.542
and stuff the leaves
in the gutters.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.083
Then clean the gutters.
But that's...

06:51.125 --> 06:52.458
They won't always be clean.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.333
You need to be prepared
for that day.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.542
Full ass, son.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.417
Fine, I'll do it after work.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.375
Wait, Steve, didn't you say

07:00.417 --> 07:02.542
someone got fired
at the grocery store?

07:02.583 --> 07:04.792
Stan, maybe you
could take that job.

07:04.834 --> 07:05.792
Oh, no, no, no!

07:05.834 --> 07:07.625
Uh, uh, Dad doesn't
want that job.

07:07.667 --> 07:08.875
It's-it's entry level.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.291
Well, I got to start somewhere.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.959
Yay, I don't have
to get a job!

07:18.750 --> 07:22.166
Hey, Steve, did you see that
guy earlier buying condoms?

07:22.208 --> 07:24.208
And now this lady's
getting tampons.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.834
This day is crazy.

07:25.875 --> 07:29.208
I didn't know grocery
stores were so sexy.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.250
Have fun.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.542
You know that chick has sex.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.375
Dad, come on,
we're working.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.083
Hey, Steve.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.583
Rick just quit.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.625
So, how would you like to be

07:40.667 --> 07:42.667
the new assistant manager?

07:42.709 --> 07:43.917
Would I?!

07:43.959 --> 07:45.333
Sir, I've got so much more

07:45.375 --> 07:47.041
workforce experience
than Steve.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.917
Yeah, but Steve's
been here a month.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.667
So, Steve, here's
your huge key ring.

07:51.709 --> 07:55.291
Oh, boy, now I have access
to the teeth-whitening kits

07:55.333 --> 07:57.458
and all liquor over $40!

07:57.500 --> 07:59.458
Well, congratulations, Steve.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
Thanks, Dad.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.709
Now go take the pieces
of dead onion skin

08:02.750 --> 08:04.417
out of the shopping baskets.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.417
This totally blows.

08:07.458 --> 08:10.083
I worked for the CIA
for 20 years, you know.

08:11.959 --> 08:15.208
You really got to put
a sock in it, Stan!

08:24.834 --> 08:26.166
I don't like your tune.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.125
Now, when you're done with this,

08:27.166 --> 08:28.709
I need you to go count
the tomatoes.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.500
Geez, why are you
being so bossy?

08:30.542 --> 08:32.000
'Cause I'm your boss.

08:32.041 --> 08:33.125
Not if I quit.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.125
Yeah? You think

08:34.166 --> 08:35.792
your permanent record
looks bad now?

08:35.834 --> 08:37.041
Think how it'll look if you quit

08:37.083 --> 08:38.875
your only job in 20 years.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.041
Quit.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.291
In your dreams.

08:42.625 --> 08:45.083
Steve, they just
delivered the butter.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.583
One of your new
responsibilities

08:46.625 --> 08:48.583
is to show the baggers
how to stock it.

08:48.625 --> 08:49.959
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.959
So, we're right behind
the butter shelves.

08:55.166 --> 08:58.041
Whoa! How long has
this place been here?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.458
Get your jaw off
the floor and start stocking.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.458
And don't let the butter sit
on the ground too long

09:02.500 --> 09:04.709
because the fridges
put out some major heat.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.834
Got it?

09:08.375 --> 09:09.417
It won't fit.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.959
You got to take it
out of the crate, dummy.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.041
Then you make it fit.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.625
Lay the butter like bricks.

09:14.667 --> 09:15.959
With the labels facing out.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.917
Got it?

09:16.959 --> 09:18.291
Yeah, I got it.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.625
I earned a break.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.333
I'll be napping
in the blood pressure chair.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.375
What's this?

09:32.417 --> 09:34.125
Oh, sorry.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.041
No, start over
and do it right.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.834
Oh, that poor,
mentally-disabled man.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.291
I'm not mentally disabled!

09:46.333 --> 09:49.500
Well, you don't know
how to stack butter, so...

09:54.250 --> 09:56.166
Hey, your guitar DVD came.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.709
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:59.750 --> 10:02.750
You're battling that guy in
the coffee shop in two days.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.417
Oh, my God,
that's so important to me!

10:04.458 --> 10:06.208
Quick, put it in the DVD player!

10:07.583 --> 10:08.792
Just skip to the first lesson.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.125
I don't have a lot
of time to learn.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.208
Now it is your turn.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.834
Start with the G chord,

10:15.875 --> 10:18.166
which you finger like this.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.500
He's going too fast.

10:19.542 --> 10:21.250
I'll pause.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.458
I think I got it.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.959
Ready?
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.291
Now strum.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.375
Aah! It's got me!

10:34.166 --> 10:37.250
Well, I guess this
is my hand now.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.458
I hate working
at that store!

10:41.500 --> 10:43.208
Steve just
bosses me around.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.333
The only good thing is
that the stock boys

10:45.375 --> 10:46.667
are teaching
me Spanish,

10:46.709 --> 10:48.875
so that's pretty
cállate gringo.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.375
Dad, why on Earth
did you make me

10:50.417 --> 10:53.208
take all of our spare light
bulbs out of their boxes?

10:53.250 --> 10:55.667
Stan, is this just
to get back at Steve

10:55.709 --> 10:57.500
for bossing you around
at the store?

10:57.542 --> 10:59.875
Are you accusing me of
being vindictive, Francine?

10:59.917 --> 11:01.625
Because I will destroy you!

11:01.667 --> 11:02.959
Besides, there's a reason

11:03.000 --> 11:05.375
I'm making him do
all these things.

11:05.417 --> 11:07.208
Now take off your shoes
and sweep up that glass.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.625
Take off
my shoes?!

11:08.667 --> 11:09.709
Take 'em off.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.000
Oh, you're in for it
tomorrow, mister.

11:12.041 --> 11:14.000
The regional manager's
coming for our review

11:14.041 --> 11:16.041
and I'm gonna
be busting your ass all day.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.083
I'll just
call in sick.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.417
I'll tell them
you're faking.

11:18.458 --> 11:19.583
And you'll get fired.

11:19.625 --> 11:21.542
Then how will you
support your woman?

11:21.583 --> 11:24.083
How will you keep her
glowing in such finery?

11:29.875 --> 11:30.750
That's right.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.125
Now you're getting it!

11:32.166 --> 11:34.166
No, I'm not,
and there's no way

11:34.208 --> 11:36.333
I'll learn by tomorrow!

11:37.375 --> 11:39.000
Not learning fast enough?

11:39.041 --> 11:40.000
What the hell?

11:40.041 --> 11:41.041
How are you...

11:46.834 --> 11:48.166
I am Lorenzo.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.458
AKA Old Scratch.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.667
I can offer you a shortcut
to guitar mastery,

11:53.709 --> 11:56.417
but it comes at
an ironic price.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.792
Yeah, yeah, I'll
pay any price.

11:57.834 --> 12:00.041
You realize I'm the Devil
and... and you're making

12:00.083 --> 12:01.625
what is called
a Faustian bargain, right?

12:01.667 --> 12:03.125
Yeah, sure,
sure, sure.
Really?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.875
'Cause you don't sound
like you understand

12:04.917 --> 12:06.709
the gravity
of the ironic price.

12:06.750 --> 12:07.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's fine.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.125
I mean, I really
have to crush

12:09.166 --> 12:10.333
this punk at
the coffee shop.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.583
He's got this stupid
little goatee...

12:11.625 --> 12:12.959
Ah! Enough!
Enough.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.875
I'm sure your
reasons are terrific

12:14.917 --> 12:17.083
if you are willing
to pay with your soul.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.583
Wait, my soul?

12:20.625 --> 12:22.166
My Kia Soul?

12:22.208 --> 12:24.709
How am I supposed to get
to my shift at Dairy Queen?

12:25.917 --> 12:27.083
Stacey, it's Roger.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.333
Hey, can you cover
my 3:00 to 7:00 tonight?

12:29.375 --> 12:31.166
Oh, my soul!

12:31.208 --> 12:32.959
Never mind.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.291
Hey, are you going
to Jake's party?

12:37.750 --> 12:38.917
Tom, I gotta say.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.583
You hit a solid double here.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.500
I'm just happy
to get on base.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.041
I make the baseball
references...

12:45.083 --> 12:47.041
Oh. My. God.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.041
Holy moly.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.083
Stan, what's going on?

12:50.125 --> 12:52.166
There's butter melting
all over the place!

12:52.208 --> 12:53.709
Yeah, I, uh,
I could only fit

12:53.750 --> 12:55.083
one crate
on the shelf.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.083
The rest is by the
refrigeration exhaust.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.375
Steve, you were
supposed to show Stan

12:59.417 --> 13:00.667
how to stock the butter!

13:00.709 --> 13:02.166
Yeah, I sure
could have used

13:02.208 --> 13:03.500
some supervision
on that one.

13:03.542 --> 13:04.500
Wh-What?

13:04.542 --> 13:05.875
I-I showed you!

13:05.917 --> 13:07.208
Clearly not well enough.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.375
And I'm a sponge,
I was waiting for it.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.125
This is not
good, Steve.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.000
It's just lucky
no one got hurt.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.083
Joshua!

13:33.417 --> 13:34.375
I'm sorry, Steve,

13:34.417 --> 13:35.667
but I'm gonna have
to let you go.

13:35.709 --> 13:36.625
But...
No buts.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.917
Now let's have
the apron.

13:43.041 --> 13:44.917
It's always hard
to see a young boy

13:44.959 --> 13:46.542
tarnish his permanent record.

13:46.583 --> 13:49.166
Hold on.
This'll be on his
permanent record?

13:49.208 --> 13:50.250
Uh, yeah.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.583
He was assistant manager

13:51.625 --> 13:53.542
and he didn't show you
how to put the butter away.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.166
That's something
every employer

13:55.208 --> 13:57.709
for the rest of his life
is gonna want to know.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.291
Yeah, if he can even find a job.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.750
Oh, God!

14:01.792 --> 14:03.000
What have I done?

14:12.208 --> 14:13.834
I showed him how
to stock the butter

14:13.875 --> 14:15.792
and he did it wrong on purpose.

14:15.834 --> 14:16.959
He got me fired!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.667
But he still has
his job, right?

14:18.709 --> 14:20.500
I can keep
my finery?

14:20.542 --> 14:21.750
You!

14:21.792 --> 14:23.917
You have a lot of nerve
showing your face here!

14:23.959 --> 14:25.500
You're right to
be mad, Steve.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.125
And it's worse
than you think.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.375
I got you fired...

14:28.417 --> 14:30.333
and now it's on your
permanent record.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.291
Good lord.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.417
My future...

14:33.458 --> 14:35.667
He's gonna be
ridin' the rails, Stan!

14:38.375 --> 14:40.417
It's come to
our attention!

14:40.458 --> 14:42.375
That your son's run
out of options.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.792
The Army'll
take him!

14:43.834 --> 14:46.000
Get out of here,
you damn vulture!

14:47.667 --> 14:49.417
Thank you for your service.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.458
Dad, what are we doing
at your old office?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.875
Well, the CIA was able to keep

14:59.917 --> 15:02.458
my 20 years with them
off my permanent record,

15:02.500 --> 15:04.166
so they must have
access to them.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.583
Okay, but why'd
you drag me along?

15:06.625 --> 15:08.709
Well, I don't have
my badge anymore,

15:08.750 --> 15:10.333
so I need your help
getting into the building.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.125
And how am I
supposed to do that?

15:12.166 --> 15:13.417
Like this.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.208
Ow!

15:23.917 --> 15:25.917
Okay, I just have to log in

15:25.959 --> 15:28.500
and see how they access
the permanent records.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.667
Damn it, they already
deleted my password!

15:32.709 --> 15:34.166
Your password
was one letter?

15:34.208 --> 15:36.583
Yeah, it's, like, super easy
to remember that way.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.917
Well, I guess
this was a dead end.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.000
Or...

15:40.041 --> 15:41.417
maybe we could go
to the basement,

15:41.458 --> 15:42.417
'cause that's where

15:42.458 --> 15:44.208
the Permanent Record
Department is.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.917
This is Deputy Director Bullock

15:46.959 --> 15:49.750
reminding you that secrets
are meant to be kept.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.333
Now, back to
the elevator music.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.125
♪ Friday night it was late ♪

15:54.166 --> 15:55.375
♪ I was walking you home ♪

15:55.417 --> 15:57.000
♪ We got down to the gate ♪

15:57.041 --> 16:00.583
♪ And I was dreaming
of the night... ♪

16:03.667 --> 16:05.083
It's a permanent record!

16:05.125 --> 16:08.166
"Martin McGowan pretended
to pick up his dog's poop,

16:08.208 --> 16:11.125
but just grabbed at the air
and kept walking."

16:11.166 --> 16:13.417
Wow.
They are on top of stuff.

16:13.458 --> 16:14.834
Come on, let's find yours.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.083
Here it is.

16:21.917 --> 16:23.542
"Fired from grocery store

16:23.583 --> 16:25.166
for incompetent management."

16:25.208 --> 16:27.000
Don't worry,
we'll fix that.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.375
"And it was totally not
Steve's fault."

16:35.417 --> 16:36.375
There.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.875
Now, to spice it up.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.875
"Steve Smith lost his virginity

16:39.917 --> 16:42.500
"after a romantic candlelight
dinner on the beach.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.667
"He suggested
taking things slow,

16:44.667 --> 16:46.333
"but she was voracious,

16:46.375 --> 16:48.625
"with an unquenchable
sex-thirst.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.417
And he did a good job."

16:50.458 --> 16:51.583
Solid.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.417
- Now, let's get outta here.
- Freeze!

16:54.875 --> 16:56.500
Sir, we were just
trying to repair

16:56.542 --> 16:57.792
Steve's
permanent record.

16:57.834 --> 16:58.959
He shouldn't be burdened

16:59.000 --> 17:01.041
for the rest of his life
for something I did.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.792
Well, that's the system.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.500
And when I send this downstairs,

17:04.542 --> 17:06.917
you'll be a virgin again,
Master Smith.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.417
You're in charge of
the permanent records?

17:09.458 --> 17:11.083
I play many
roles here.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.458
I also design
the company softball shirts.

17:16.375 --> 17:19.166
It came to me in a dream.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.542
Daddy, the bombs came.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.625
It's C-4, Gary,

17:23.667 --> 17:25.041
and I am not
your father.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.709
What about
the detonators?

17:26.709 --> 17:28.041
They came, too.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.417
I put them in the bombs
so Gary wouldn't lose them.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.500
Did you set the
timer on these?!

17:32.542 --> 17:34.250
Uh-huh, Gary
making oatmeal.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.792
Almost ready.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.291
Good God, you're gonna
blow up this office!

17:39.333 --> 17:42.500
We've got to get
this C-4 out of here!

17:42.542 --> 17:44.041
Uh-oh!

17:46.083 --> 17:47.375
Steve, throw me
more bricks.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.542
It's just like
the butter!

17:48.583 --> 17:49.834
Oh, yeah!

17:52.875 --> 17:53.875
Go, Dad!

18:02.875 --> 18:04.000
Yay!

18:04.041 --> 18:05.083
Oatmeal time!

18:05.125 --> 18:06.625
Gary, you're fired!

18:06.667 --> 18:08.834
Stan, you got your job back.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.000
Thank you for saving
our lives, Smith.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.667
Well, actually, you
should be thanking Steve.

18:12.709 --> 18:15.333
I was only able to
stack the C-4 so fast

18:15.375 --> 18:16.792
because Steve was
so hard on me

18:16.834 --> 18:17.875
at the grocery
store.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.250
Oh. Well-well,
I just did that

18:19.291 --> 18:21.583
because you were such
a jerk to me at home.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.583
I'm not trying to
be a jerk, Steve.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.166
I'm trying to save you from
a life of ridin' the rails.

18:26.208 --> 18:28.041
Dad, that's just
an expression.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.917
Tell that
to Tony Lura.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.625
He half-assed
it all summer

18:31.667 --> 18:32.959
on the grill at
White Castle.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.166
A lot of people got
really sick, actually.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.583
Then he just
disappeared.

18:36.625 --> 18:37.792
Last anyone
saw of him,

18:37.834 --> 18:39.542
he was hoppin' the
Union Pacific Line

18:39.583 --> 18:41.458
with all of his
possessions in a sock.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.500
Oh.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.208
Well, thanks for
looking out for me, Dad.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.709
I sure wouldn't want
to end up like Tony Lura.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.166
No, you wouldn't, son.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.959
And, son, that's why

18:51.000 --> 18:53.125
you don't want to end up
like Stan Smith,

18:53.166 --> 18:55.875
the White Castle employee
who did everything right.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.375
'Cause what did it get him?

18:57.417 --> 19:00.000
A government job fighting
for so-called freedom

19:00.041 --> 19:02.208
from the confines of a cubicle.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.709
Well, this is my cubicle!

19:06.500 --> 19:08.792
And this is real freedom!

19:09.583 --> 19:11.208
You understand, son?

19:12.917 --> 19:14.083
Yep.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.917
The world is our oyster!

19:27.458 --> 19:30.875
They're clapping
'cause it's over.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.792
♪ ♪

20:33.250 --> 20:35.000
You get the drift, I win.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.834
Listen, buddy, you clearly won,
but I really need this gig.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.709
I tell you what-- you
seem like a nice guy.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.417
What if I let you
keep playing here

20:43.458 --> 20:45.500
and you just cover
the price of my lessons?

20:45.542 --> 20:47.125
That'd be amazing!

20:47.166 --> 20:48.917
Then it's a deal.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.250
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
