And it's not like they're not
meant to screw you up,

29:21.880 --> 29:23.800
your parents, is it?

29:30.320 --> 29:32.240
[Message alert]

29:41.440 --> 29:43.360
[Exhales and sniffs]

29:47.840 --> 29:49.600
So are you...
are you on a date?

29:49.640 --> 29:51.080
Yeah.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.840
I was meant to be on a date.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.160
Not coming.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.600
[Hannah] Just use a ruler
and pencil to cross out.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
- I want a pen.
- Not in pen.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.680
I really want to do it in pen.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.160
You smell good.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.240
- [Coughs]
- I'm swinging by your office.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.080
Zander called. They want
some pointers on fertility law.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.120
- Oh.
- Vinnie?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.960
Don't throw it. Don't.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.640
Four lines
and then you're done.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.920

30:37.640 --> 30:39.000

In every paper?

30:58.560 --> 31:01.360
Even got the figures
for the sunset clause right.

31:01.400 --> 31:04.880
The Diopo prenup this morning.
We're meeting in Boardroom 4.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.880
Sorry, I'm in court for Zander.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.200
How... How did the date go?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.000
He's still not answering.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.360
It was a hen weekend.
We were all drunk,

31:27.400 --> 31:28.880
all the girlfriends and wives.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.360
I didn't sleep with any
stripper, or anybody.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.200
I don't even know
who these two guys are.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.600
But it's shaken my client's
confidence and his sponsors'.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.240
The same source says
there were also drugs involved.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.560
That's libel. An unnamed source
used as evidence is libel.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.720
Diallo, I've been
ringing you all night.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.680
That's not true,
you know that is not true.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.080
- It's not how it looks, Kels.
- There are concerns--

31:49.120 --> 31:51.560
- You're not doing this!
- ..brings too much damage.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.200
I want to hear it from you.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.680
Say, "The wedding is off."

31:56.840 --> 31:59.840
Say it, say it to my face.
Say that you cannot marry me.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.840
Je ne peux pas.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.720
Je suis désolé.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.680
- Hannah, say something.
- This is unacceptable.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.120
[Lauren]
Diallo, could you wait outside?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.280
You will of course
be recompensed.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.280
It's a generous offer.

32:29.320 --> 32:32.520
In return, you will agree to
sign a non-disclosure agreement

32:32.560 --> 32:35.280
not to discuss your
relationship with my client.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.240
[Kelsey stifles sob]

32:39.640 --> 32:41.480
[Kelsey sniffs]

32:41.520 --> 32:43.440
Yeah, well, I don't want it.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.600
I don't want his money.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.280
Someone on your team
leaked that photo.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.280
Who else does this benefit?

32:59.320 --> 33:02.120
They had details of the prenup,
specific clauses

33:02.160 --> 33:04.160
that could only have come
from your side.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.720
And this is speculation.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.240
This photograph is embarrassing
and damaging for my client.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.480
- I have to protect him.
- Right, right.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.120
No matter that it is
deliberately misleading

33:13.160 --> 33:14.800
and that he has
been misinformed?

33:18.200 --> 33:20.400
Christie's in court
all morning.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.760
If I interrupted
anything last night--

33:23.800 --> 33:24.960
It's complicated.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.960
We hadn't seen one another
since the divorce.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.800
My last image is of me
screaming at him in Hong Kong.

33:29.840 --> 33:31.200
We've all done that before.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.720
- Your first?
- Uh-huh. You?

33:36.760 --> 33:38.280
Three.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.640
Like a grenade
in my marriage every time.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.120
I'm sorry it didn't work out...

33:45.560 --> 33:47.400
..with you and Christie.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.840
He mentioned
he didn't want kids.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.840
[Elevator bell pings]

33:51.880 --> 33:54.560
- [Elevator door opens]
- She's a sweet girl.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.920
And this might have just
done her a favor.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.120
I'll send another copy of
the non-disclosure.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.720
Encourage her to sign.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.280

the injunction register.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.760
- John?
- Mm.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.120
- Still got his number?
- It was one night.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.120
Get him to do a search
for any other women

34:20.160 --> 34:22.680
who have signed
non-disclosures on Diallo.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.400

34:59.680 --> 35:03.040
Can you see that
this gets back to him, please?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.800
Are you sure?

35:10.840 --> 35:12.760
It's too big anyway.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.080
She's young. Divorce?

35:21.080 --> 35:22.160
Prenup.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.000
Tell her to run for the hills.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.960
So...

35:31.840 --> 35:33.760
Davey's Form E is in

35:33.800 --> 35:36.800
and should show us
the full financial picture

35:36.840 --> 35:38.760
of your family.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.920
I thought he'd paid off the
mortgage on the Nice apartment.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.520
And he hasn't put in the yacht.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.480
Or the plane.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.640
That's why I'd like to send
our forensic accountant

35:56.680 --> 35:58.000
to the house this afternoon.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.960
He'll take an inventory,

36:00.000 --> 36:01.920
a true value of everything.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.680
- Do I have to move out?
- No.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.120
You do not move
out of the house.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.320
It's your home.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.920
Goldie, do you hear me?

36:12.400 --> 36:15.560
Once we've gathered information
we need from the family home,

36:15.600 --> 36:17.880
we'll move on
to his business accounts.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.560
My concern is that he's...

36:21.720 --> 36:24.120
..not being as transparent
as we would like.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.080
Hm.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.560
Okay. So now...

36:31.480 --> 36:34.000
..this is where Davey
has chosen

36:34.040 --> 36:36.120
to cite his own reasons
for divorce.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.680
"Respondent drank to excess"?

36:47.360 --> 36:50.880
It's two, maybe three glasses
of wine of an evening.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.440
"In the latter half
of the marriage,

36:55.480 --> 36:58.640
there was little to no...
sexual companionship.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.840
Mrs. McKenzie treated it...

37:05.240 --> 37:07.440
..like it was
'the last job of the day.'

37:08.880 --> 37:10.800
The marriage was done."

37:11.920 --> 37:13.320
That bitch.

[Sniffs]

37:16.240 --> 37:17.880
He had an affair.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.920
He was the one that cheated
on me, with my best friend.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.640
This is intimidation.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.600
They want you to settle.

37:25.640 --> 37:30.320
And that's why they have
made you a separate offer here.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.880
But it's too low.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.240
So I want to go back.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.120
From...personal experience...

37:44.880 --> 37:47.880
I know that his solicitor
fights hard for her clients.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.040
But you've got me, Goldie.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.400
I'm on your side.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.640
So are you ready?

38:03.160 --> 38:04.680
[Sniffs]

38:06.120 --> 38:07.720
Yeah.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.080
[Low conversations]

38:19.680 --> 38:21.600
Sorry, court ran over.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.160
Let's go into my office.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.960
- You want me to er...
- No, no.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.960
It's nice to watch her when
she doesn't know I'm looking.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.320
Good, you came.
Christie'll look after you.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.960
Good win on
the Nelson settlement.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.440
- I try.
- Next time be on our side!

38:38.160 --> 38:40.080
So how'd it go with Nina?

38:41.200 --> 38:44.280
First rule: you get one Defoe
sister, you get them all.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.240
20 years' experience.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.360
Well, um...
thanks for the heads up.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.120
So...fertility law.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.840
We have various cases I know
Zander wanted you to look at.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.120
Oh, hey.

39:02.160 --> 39:04.440
You've finished up
on the Diopo prenup?

39:04.480 --> 39:06.640
No, currently on the rocks.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.520
I was about to run over
various cases:

39:08.560 --> 39:10.080
Jaynie Lee in particular.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.080
She fired her second barrister
a week ago.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.040
We thought
Nathan could be her third.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.680
Zander's idea.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.240
Right. I'll look forward
to you filling me in.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.360
Bill for double time.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.880
See you at home.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.440
[Davey] A forensic accountant?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.600
£600 an hour, he costs.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.560
And I'm expected to pay?

39:42.600 --> 39:45.000
Do you really want to do this?

39:45.840 --> 39:48.520
I thought I'd made
a decent offer.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.480
I don't want decent.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.800
I want what's fair.
I want what I'm owed.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.640
God, have...
have you had your bags done?

39:59.040 --> 40:01.320
[Chuckles] You have!

40:01.360 --> 40:04.360
You've had your bags done.
Where did you get them done?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.320
Do they look alright?

40:06.360 --> 40:09.920
I'm not sleeping and
you get your bags done?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.400
Goldie.

40:11.440 --> 40:16.000
You have ripped my heart out
so it hurts to breathe, Davey.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.680
I don't want you to be in pain,
love.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.640
Aw. Well, I am...

40:21.680 --> 40:23.480

40:28.080 --> 40:30.000
[Camera shutter clicks]

40:37.880 --> 40:40.080
Do you know
what I don't understand...

40:41.000 --> 40:42.920
..what I've never understood?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.240
You were abandoned,
you were deserted.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.800
And yet you show no sympathy
for women like Goldie.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.720
It's not my job
to show sympathy.

40:50.760 --> 40:54.320
It's my job to get
the best deal for my client.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.520
Accusing her of alcoholism
is the best deal?

40:57.560 --> 41:00.960
Trying to get her out of
her house is the best deal?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.080
Nobody said divorce
wasn't a shock.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.720
We all have to stand
on our own two feet one day.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.680
She's been standing on
her own two feet for 40 years!

41:08.720 --> 41:10.640
Just not in an office.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.280
She signed up to this man
and he's let her down.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.600
You were just like this
as a little girl.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.320
- You came out screaming.
- You never asked why?

41:18.360 --> 41:19.920
[Ruth sighs]

41:19.960 --> 41:22.360
- We saw Dad last night.
- [Sighs]

41:23.200 --> 41:25.120
He wastes no time.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.080
It's 30 years, Mother.
Is he dying?

41:28.120 --> 41:30.040
It's that or he's skipped bail.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.360
I don't know, Hannah.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.200
Yes, you do.
You always know everything.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.160
Perhaps he wants
to make amends.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.680
Great, he can buy me
the unicorn he promised

41:37.720 --> 41:40.040
or tell me where he
used to stash his dope.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.000
And where's Maya, by the way?

41:42.040 --> 41:45.040
Don't you think it's weird
he's come without her?

41:45.080 --> 41:47.160
I don't know.
Let's hope she's died.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.360
Do you want the Burgundies
logged in with the other reds?

41:51.400 --> 41:53.000
[Both] Yes.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.440
- I won't talk about this now.
- Well, after--

41:55.480 --> 41:57.400
Please, Hannah.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.480
[Birdsong]

42:00.520 --> 42:02.640
[James] It'll buy us
a few months' traveling.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.880
Then I'd hope that once we're
back, we'll start a family.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.840
- Really?
- Within a few months.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.720
Not in a few months?

42:12.760 --> 42:14.680
A few years, maybe.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.960
James?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.920
What are you thinking?

42:22.720 --> 42:25.520
- Well, I just thought...
- I'm not ready for kids.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.120
You love kids.
You work with them.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.640
Exactly.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.600
When I get home, I wanna...

42:30.640 --> 42:32.560
- Do what?
- Do stuff.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.200
We haven't got
anywhere to live.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.880
