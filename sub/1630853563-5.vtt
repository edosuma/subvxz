WEBVTT

00:15.250 --> 00:16.666
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:20.916
Ah!

00:27.083 --> 00:28.500
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.458 --> 00:31.291
Ah!

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Ouch!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.791
-Hey!

00:51.541 --> 00:53.958
<i>Merry, happy sweethearts.</i>

00:54.041 --> 00:58.375
<i>It's everyone's second favorite holiday,</i>
<i>Christmas in July,</i>

00:58.458 --> 01:02.583
<i>and that calls for my second favorite</i>
<i>chart topping song,</i>

01:02.666 --> 01:06.250
<i>"It's Always Christmas in July Somewhere."</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:17.583
Too hot
to be wearing this sweater.

01:17.666 --> 01:19.333
Barney!

01:20.166 --> 01:22.125
I didn't know we celebrated Christmas.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.416
Technically, it's Christmas in July,
which is not a real holiday.

01:25.500 --> 01:29.791
Well, then I guess
these presents aren't real either.

01:29.875 --> 01:30.750
Gimme!

01:33.791 --> 01:34.708
Ta-da!

01:35.416 --> 01:36.250
Wow.

01:36.333 --> 01:39.500
I got you a little wizard hat
'cause you're a little wizard dog now.

01:39.583 --> 01:43.541
This is the first present you've given me
I wasn't intended to eat.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.958
I don't mind what you do with it.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.333
And for Norma, a doll!

01:49.416 --> 01:52.291
Ugh. I appreciate the gesture,

01:52.375 --> 01:55.000
but do I look like somebody
who plays with…

01:56.125 --> 01:58.583
The limited edition
Y2K Millennium Bug Pauline?

01:58.666 --> 02:02.375
Whoo-hoo! Thank you, Barney!

02:02.458 --> 02:07.791
Well, well, well, look who's a regular
Christmas in July Krampus.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.833
I'm guessing you didn't get me anything.

02:10.916 --> 02:13.166
I did. I got you…

02:13.958 --> 02:14.916
-trash!

02:15.000 --> 02:19.833
Oh, great. Yeah, because I'm a demon,
I must love trash.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.666
But you do?

02:22.375 --> 02:23.791
That's not the point. Okay?

02:26.208 --> 02:28.958
Leave me alone.

02:31.625 --> 02:32.583
What's her problem?

02:32.666 --> 02:36.000
I don't know.
You know, I try to do something nice…

02:39.666 --> 02:44.416
Hey, buddy. Uh, you okay?

02:45.666 --> 02:48.916
Sensing a lot of big sweatpants energy
coming off you today.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.708
-Shh!

02:50.791 --> 02:52.625
It's the <i>Real Housewives of Hades.</i>

02:52.708 --> 02:55.625
<i>Okay, Eurydice says</i>
<i>that Orpheus didn't look at her,</i>

02:55.708 --> 02:59.333
<i>but he was totally</i>
<i>not looking at me instead. Okay?</i>

02:59.416 --> 03:05.000
Uh, sorry about the whole never being
able to go home to the Demon World thing.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.250
Ugh.

03:07.291 --> 03:11.208
I'm stuck with a bunch of whiny humans

03:11.291 --> 03:14.750
in a theme park for the rest of eternity.

03:14.833 --> 03:18.458
I'd literally rather be in purgatory.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.625
So just let me wallow, would you?

03:26.208 --> 03:28.208
-Not now.
-What's that?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.666
It's a notification.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.583
Hey!

03:32.458 --> 03:34.416
Congratulations!

03:34.500 --> 03:38.291
You've been selected for <i>Hox's Castle,</i>

03:38.375 --> 03:41.166
the biggest show in the multi-plane.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.125
So, come on down to plane ten to be in

03:44.208 --> 03:47.291
with a chance to win
the greatest prize of all--

03:49.208 --> 03:50.041
Rude.

03:51.708 --> 03:53.208
Oh. Great.

03:53.291 --> 03:56.166
Okay, way to rub it in, universe.

03:56.250 --> 04:00.125
I applied 500 years ago,
and now I can't even go.

04:00.791 --> 04:02.708
Leave me alone, Pugsley.

04:02.791 --> 04:06.125
<i>Start your night off right</i>
<i>with a bowl of Norma's Beestings,</i>

04:06.208 --> 04:08.916
<i>-now with organic flesh chunks.</i>
-Hmm.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.500
You want us to travel to the Demon World,
and go on a game show for some prize?

04:20.583 --> 04:22.208
I didn't know there were
game shows down there.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.291
Apparently, that's where
they were invented.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.375
But wouldn't we be eaten alive,

04:26.458 --> 04:29.375
or poked with those
little stabby trident things,

04:29.458 --> 04:33.875
or I don't know,
bathed in smelly bathwater?

04:33.958 --> 04:36.666
I don't know much
about demon culture.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.291
It might be fun to learn.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.750
Those demon books
can only teach us so much.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.750
Hmm. I don't know.

04:42.833 --> 04:45.833
Come on, Barney.
If we bring Courtney back this prize,

04:45.916 --> 04:47.666
we'll beat her blues. I'm sure of it.

04:53.958 --> 04:56.375
Ah, fine. I guess cheering up Courtney

04:56.458 --> 04:59.250
is the Christmas in July thing
to do after all.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.791
Ha-ha, yay!

05:11.291 --> 05:13.416
Is now a good time to mention
I'm scared of elevators?

05:13.500 --> 05:18.166
<i>Doors closing. Going down.</i>

05:20.416 --> 05:22.041
Oh. This isn't too--

05:37.458 --> 05:38.833
Wow.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.250
Whoa.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.458
Goat heads.
Get your sacrificial goat heads.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.875
Whoa. This is incredible.

05:56.958 --> 06:00.083
<i>It's a hot one today,</i>
<i>folks, with a good chance of bloodshed.</i>

06:00.166 --> 06:01.916
Uh, you know,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.166
it's not too late to just go buy Courtney
a mug or something.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.041
My new contestants, I presume.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.833
We don't get many visitors
from the neutral plane.

06:11.916 --> 06:14.500
Step right in.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.958
You know, I'm fine with this,

06:17.041 --> 06:20.041
but if anybody else
wants to turn back right now,

06:20.125 --> 06:22.041
I'll support you.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.000
Huh, Pugsley?

06:24.541 --> 06:25.375
Whoa!

06:27.250 --> 06:29.791
Get your sacrificial goat heads.

06:37.791 --> 06:40.791
<i>Welcome to</i> Hox's Castle.

06:40.875 --> 06:45.833
<i>Give it up for your host,</i>
<i>Rancibalafloss El Hoxtrot!</i>

06:48.208 --> 06:51.708
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Too kind.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.583
You can call me Hox.

06:54.666 --> 06:57.875
Hox, over here.
Look at me. Hi! I love you.

06:59.083 --> 07:03.500
Welcome once more to <i>Hox's Castle,</i>
my castle.

07:03.583 --> 07:09.708
Last week we unfortunately had
to say goodbye to the Pazuzu family.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.125
-Ha-ha! Losers!

07:12.208 --> 07:16.625
Hopefully, tonight's contestants
will be a lot more robust

07:16.708 --> 07:18.458
and a lot less chewy.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.416
Let's go ahead and meet 'em.

07:20.500 --> 07:24.875
Here we have Barry, Norman,
and a little snowman-looking creature.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.583
How you doing?
What do you do for a living?

07:27.666 --> 07:30.083
Uh, we work in a theme park.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.333
As security guards.

07:31.416 --> 07:32.791
And I'm the comic relief.

07:34.291 --> 07:38.458
Beautiful, beautiful.
All right, let's get on with the show!

07:38.541 --> 07:42.375
To win, these three must complete
a series of impossible challenges

07:42.458 --> 07:45.416
with only one lifeline.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.208
Careful how you use it.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.708
Now, let's see what they'll be facing.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.041
Phew.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.500
Oh, terrific, it's the Garden…

08:06.583 --> 08:07.833
of Pain.

08:09.541 --> 08:10.666
Pain?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.083
Welcome to your first challenge.

08:15.166 --> 08:19.583
To progress, all you have to do
is cross this courtyard.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.458
Here's a little hint
to help you on your way.

08:24.541 --> 08:27.625
"The sand will sink
and the fires will rise.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.250
The path will unfold before your eyes.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.333
"But don't step off its well-trod stones,

08:34.416 --> 08:38.625
lest the pixies pick your bones."

08:38.708 --> 08:41.708
Who wrote this? Good luck!

08:44.041 --> 08:46.791
Pugsley, this prize better be worth it.

08:46.875 --> 08:50.083
Perhaps the true prize
is spending time with your friends.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.708
What's the problem?
It sounds simple enough.

08:52.791 --> 08:55.166
-We just got to step on that--

08:55.250 --> 08:58.166
Ow. Ow. What did I do wrong?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.125
Ow. Ow! Ow! Get off me!

09:04.208 --> 09:05.958
He said well-trod stones.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.250
Look for the worn down ones.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.250
-Come on!

09:13.000 --> 09:14.666
<i>Plenty of sunshine through--</i>

09:14.750 --> 09:16.500
<i>Fighting broke out overnight--</i>

09:17.416 --> 09:20.708
<i>Our contestants are itching to reach</i>
<i>the other side of the courtyard.</i>

09:20.791 --> 09:23.625
-Ugh. <i>Hox's Castle.</i> Great.
-<i>It's just right there, guys.</i>

09:23.708 --> 09:25.541
<i>Ow! I got it right.</i>

09:25.625 --> 09:28.791
<i>-Ah! This isn't fair.</i>
-Wait, that sounds like Norma complaining.

09:28.875 --> 09:32.375
Norma, go away. I'm trying to watch TV.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.166
<i>I definitely got that right.</i>

09:34.250 --> 09:36.208
Huh? What?

09:39.291 --> 09:41.416
Hey, Norma, we still on for lunch?

09:41.500 --> 09:46.333
Come on. I just want to watch TV
and hate myself in peace.

09:46.416 --> 09:50.708
Come on. Open up.
I brought soup.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.500
<i>Never mind that.</i>
<i>Just leave it.</i>

09:53.583 --> 09:54.875
Okay.

09:54.958 --> 09:56.333
Ugh.

10:00.416 --> 10:03.458
Huh? Oh, for crying out loud.

10:06.208 --> 10:09.333
Oh. Hi, Norma's little red friend.
Do you know where she is?

10:09.416 --> 10:11.375
-<i>Help!</i>

10:12.458 --> 10:13.416
Norma?

10:13.500 --> 10:16.000
<i>Get off me.</i>

10:16.083 --> 10:18.750
<i>What is that? Ugh!</i>

10:18.833 --> 10:20.500
Norma's on TV?

10:20.583 --> 10:24.250
Is this a game show?
Why didn't she mention this?

10:24.333 --> 10:27.916
Uh, it's a surprise.

10:28.000 --> 10:28.958
So, surprise!

10:29.041 --> 10:31.083
I'll take the soup.
You can leave now. Bye.

10:34.375 --> 10:37.916
<i>Looks like we'll be saying goodbye</i>
<i>to our contestants after just one round.</i>

10:39.041 --> 10:41.250
We're all gonna die!

10:45.875 --> 10:47.750
Enough!

10:55.458 --> 10:58.333
What the here was that?

10:58.416 --> 11:00.333
You didn't tell me
that this thing was a warlock.

11:00.416 --> 11:01.666
Get casting on the line.

11:02.791 --> 11:04.291
Where'd they all go?

11:04.375 --> 11:05.833
Well, that's a first.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.708
Ooh, did we set a record or something?

11:07.791 --> 11:10.125
Uh, something like that.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.208
Anyway, round two!

11:13.625 --> 11:16.000
So, how many rounds is it?

11:16.083 --> 11:18.500
I don't ever remember seeing a round two.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.583
<i>Well done, contestants.</i>

11:21.666 --> 11:25.458
Now you're going up
against the lightning round.

11:25.541 --> 11:26.625
Yes, trivia!

11:26.708 --> 11:29.041
Not quite.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.583
To advance, all you have to do
is climb these stairs.

11:35.666 --> 11:38.500
I'll see you at the top,

11:38.583 --> 11:42.166
and, uh, oh, take your time.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.833
Okay.

11:57.416 --> 12:02.041
Huh? Oh, it's okay. Come on.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.791
This shouldn't be so simple.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.291
Isn't it a good thing that it's simple?

12:13.375 --> 12:15.125
That's easy for you to say.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.583
I never really got the hang of this.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.833
But I don't get
what's lightning round about this.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.958
What's this show's budget?

12:38.916 --> 12:40.625
Come on, Pugsley!

12:40.708 --> 12:45.291
Ah! Ah! Ah! I wanna get off! Ah!

12:45.375 --> 12:47.250
Why aren't we at the top yet?

12:47.916 --> 12:49.541
These stairs go on forever.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.208
<i>Take your time.</i>

12:51.708 --> 12:53.666
Wait. Everybody stop.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.416
Oh, no! Ahh!

13:01.125 --> 13:02.375
Pugsley, stay.

13:05.208 --> 13:08.166
He said, "Take your time," and look.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.916
Everybody, go slowly.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.500
Oh, won't you look at that?

13:30.583 --> 13:33.583
They solved another round.

13:33.666 --> 13:34.708
Yay.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.458
We're okay. We made it.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.291
Whoo! Finally.

13:42.416 --> 13:47.625
Well done, contestants.
Now you've made it to Sudden Death.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.000
Huh? What's that?

13:49.083 --> 13:51.083
-This.
-No!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.250
Oh, no, what a shame.

14:04.333 --> 14:08.625
Looks like we're down to
just two contestants.

14:09.958 --> 14:14.208
Did D-Did Barney just straight-up die?

14:14.291 --> 14:17.666
I can't believe it. Pass me the popcorn.

14:18.666 --> 14:22.541
<i>Start your night off right</i>
<i>with a bowl of Norma's Beestings,</i>

14:22.625 --> 14:24.583
<i>now with organic flesh chunks.</i>

14:24.666 --> 14:26.500
<i>And now, back to</i> Hox's Castle.

14:31.833 --> 14:32.958
Barney?

14:33.458 --> 14:35.541
Wait. What about our lifeline?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.708
I don't think that's what lifeline means.

14:37.791 --> 14:40.541
I don't think that's what
Sudden Death means.

14:40.625 --> 14:43.250
Come on. We want to use our lifeline.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.250
Are you sure? You only get one.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.333
That's not fair.
You just pushed him down the stairs.

14:50.416 --> 14:53.333
My show, my rules, sweetheart.

14:53.416 --> 14:55.458
So, will you use your lifeline?

14:55.541 --> 14:56.458
Yes!

14:56.541 --> 14:58.875
All right. Keep your fez on. Here you go.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.291
Hmm.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.541
Oh, hey, guys, what's going on?

15:07.625 --> 15:10.500
-Barney, you're back!
-Barney, Barney, Barney.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.250
Huh? What are you guys talking about? Huh?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.833
All right, cool.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.958
When we get back,
uh, remind me to call my therapist.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.125
Congratulations, questers!

15:24.208 --> 15:27.291
You've made it
to the third and final round

15:27.791 --> 15:28.666
somehow.

15:29.375 --> 15:32.833
This next challenge
will test your might, your resolve,

15:32.916 --> 15:35.875
-your charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and--

15:35.958 --> 15:37.291
Get on with it.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.875
Fine.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.958
I can't believe
you made it this far anyway.

15:41.041 --> 15:46.375
Prepare yourself
for the Chamber of Cuddles!

15:46.875 --> 15:48.000
Hmm.

15:49.541 --> 15:50.583
Good luck.

15:54.541 --> 15:58.541
Chamber of Cuddles? How do we get out?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.958
Maybe we have to cuddle each other?

16:02.041 --> 16:04.291
Oh, my ghost.
We're never getting out of here.

16:06.833 --> 16:12.000
Friends,
something's in here with us.

16:13.291 --> 16:14.333
Huh?

16:25.958 --> 16:29.416
Aw. It's just a little crabby.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
Hey there, little…

16:32.458 --> 16:33.625
guy?

16:38.041 --> 16:39.000
Whoa!

16:41.541 --> 16:43.958
What has this got to do with cuddles?

16:44.041 --> 16:47.291
That's his name. That's Cuddles.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.125
Good luck.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.833
Cuddles? Oh, talk about a callback.

16:54.916 --> 16:57.958
He hasn't been on the show
since you guys were primordial soup.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.250
That reminds me. Soup?

17:10.791 --> 17:11.833
Help me!

17:11.916 --> 17:13.083
Pugsley!

17:13.166 --> 17:14.708
Oh, no, you don't.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.083
Put them down.

17:24.875 --> 17:28.708
Oof. Come on, Barney.
You've always wanted to be a wrestler.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.041
You've gone up
against guys three times your size.

17:31.125 --> 17:35.208
Now's your chance!

17:37.250 --> 17:41.416
This one's called Seafood Suplex.

17:48.791 --> 17:49.875
Yes!

17:52.625 --> 17:53.833
Go, Barney!

17:56.833 --> 17:58.000
You can do it.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.708
He didn't do it.

18:04.791 --> 18:06.500
Oh, whoa.

18:15.416 --> 18:17.583
Enough!

18:20.125 --> 18:21.541
Whoa.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.083
Whoa. Pugsley?

18:27.791 --> 18:31.583
I knew that magic looked familiar.
It's Temeluchus.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.458
I mean, uh…

18:33.541 --> 18:37.625
I mean, our secret celebrity guest,
Temeluchus!

18:37.708 --> 18:40.625
-How's that for a twist?

18:40.708 --> 18:42.208
I love you!

18:43.041 --> 18:46.416
We'll be right back
after this message from our sponsors.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.958
Cuddles,
you have to throw the fight.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.291
That's a member
of the Demonic royal family.

18:53.375 --> 18:55.458
<i>The crowd is loving him!</i>

19:16.583 --> 19:19.666
Yeah, and, uh, stay down.

19:20.958 --> 19:26.250
Everybody, give it up
for Temeluchus and his human servants.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.250
-Whoo! Yes, human servants.

19:29.333 --> 19:32.250
-My favorite.
-Go Temeluchus! Yeah!

19:33.666 --> 19:35.541
Temeluchus?

19:35.625 --> 19:38.125
By the way, I am not his servant.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.833
We saw you clean up his poop
in a little baggy.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.708
Oh. You got me there.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.166
You picked up poo.

19:44.250 --> 19:48.000
We have been bitten, electrocuted,
strangled and traumatized.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.291
Where is our prize?

19:50.375 --> 19:52.875
Uh… Yeah, your prize.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.750
Yes. Yes, my king, uh…

19:55.833 --> 19:58.708
How was I meant to know?
No one's ever won before.

19:58.791 --> 20:01.875
Just get me something.
Get… Get me anything.

20:05.041 --> 20:11.458
"My friend died on <i>Hox's Castle</i>
and all I got was this lousy mug."

20:11.541 --> 20:14.875
Just something
to make you feel a little less homesick.

20:14.958 --> 20:17.541
Look, I know it's not much, but…

20:17.625 --> 20:19.833
I love it.

20:19.916 --> 20:24.166
I guess you forgot
we had a lunch date, but it's okay.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.250
-I saw you were busy on that show.
-You saw?

20:27.333 --> 20:30.791
Yeah, you did so good. I want to apply.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.625
Uh, well, the waiting list
is like a few thousand years, so…

20:33.708 --> 20:36.583
-Oh, Norma.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.166
A Merry Christmas in July, everyone.

20:47.875 --> 20:52.583
Temeluchus is ruling the neutral plane?
So unfair!

20:52.666 --> 20:55.000
He always gets everything before me.

20:55.958 --> 20:59.916
-It's time we pay big brother a visit.
