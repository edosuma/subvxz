00:05.422 --> 00:07.622
(man speaks indistinctly)

00:23.439 --> 00:25.140
You know the drill.

00:25.142 --> 00:26.941
Just need your
John Hancock, Dr. Mallard.

00:26.943 --> 00:31.045
I like digging 'em up a lot
better than putting 'em down.

00:31.047 --> 00:33.264
Funerals are too final.

00:33.266 --> 00:36.117
With exhumations, there's
excitement, mystery.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.819
Thanks.

00:37.821 --> 00:38.987
Till next time.

00:38.989 --> 00:42.407
Oh, uh, gonna need
the case number.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.108
Case number?
Yeah.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.960
I never got
the 27B-stroke-6

00:45.962 --> 00:48.179
with the official
NCIS case number.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.715
I will have to have a word
with Mr. Palmer.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.600
Can I have him, uh, fax it over?

00:52.602 --> 00:54.969
Uh, yeah, sure, that's fine.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.471
You're a repeat customer.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.290
Though I sure hope you haven't
taken up grave robbery

00:59.292 --> 01:00.791
as a hobby. (laughs)

01:00.793 --> 01:03.261

ZIVA: McGee, why on earth
would anyone want that?

01:46.839 --> 01:48.273
Want what?

01:49.375 --> 01:50.975
Something new to buy?

01:50.977 --> 01:52.777
I'm in, what do we got?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.295
It is called a life recorder.

01:54.297 --> 01:55.980
You wear it
around your neck.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.198
Takes photos of whatever's
in front of you

01:57.200 --> 01:59.117
every few seconds and uploads
everything to the cloud.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.285
Everything?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.737
Am I missing something here?

02:02.739 --> 02:04.355
Tony, your entire lifetime
would be recorded.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.306
Even searchable.

02:05.308 --> 02:06.524
That's horrifying.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.693
But it would help
me find my keys.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.193
Yes, and it would
allow you to look back

02:10.196 --> 02:11.696
on any moment
in your entire life.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.665
ZIVA: Perhaps some moments
should not be remembered,

02:13.667 --> 02:16.251
huh, like the last three months?
Actually, you know,

02:16.253 --> 02:18.369
I think I'm with Ziva
on this one.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.538
There are some things
I'd rather forget.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.789
Really, like what?

02:21.791 --> 02:23.558
Like the look on my
first girlfriend's face

02:23.560 --> 02:25.593
when we broke up.

02:25.595 --> 02:26.694
Haunted me for years.

02:26.696 --> 02:28.346
That's very mature of you, Tony.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.214
How much is this thing?

02:30.216 --> 02:32.183
Can't buy it yet,
it's being beta tested

02:32.185 --> 02:34.402
and I have been chosen
as one of the testers.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.937
I get my unit
in the next few weeks.

02:35.939 --> 02:37.905
What? You think Gibbs
is gonna sign off

02:37.907 --> 02:39.524
letting you wear this to work?

02:39.526 --> 02:40.992
Come on, Gibbs?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.278
The man has no sense of...

02:43.280 --> 02:44.612
What?

02:44.614 --> 02:46.014
Is he...

02:46.898 --> 02:50.001
(mumbles)

02:50.003 --> 02:51.619
Something on your
mind, DiNozzo?

02:51.621 --> 02:52.787
No.

02:52.789 --> 02:54.088
(groans)
Get moving.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.873
Got a dead sergeant
in Brookland.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.358
Meet you there.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.794
Where are you going?

03:00.679 --> 03:01.879
No 27B-stroke...

03:01.881 --> 03:02.930
We have to return him.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.016
We have to return
him right now.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.019
It's a corpse, Mr. Palmer,
not a wedding present.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.604
W-when Agent
Gibbs finds out

03:09.606 --> 03:10.972
that you exhumed
a body without...

03:10.974 --> 03:12.974
He found out.
Agent Gibbs.

03:12.976 --> 03:16.594
Um, as acting coroner,
I take full responsibility.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.062
Go.
Leaving.

03:18.897 --> 03:21.432
(door opens)

03:22.267 --> 03:24.435
What are you doing, Duck?

03:25.270 --> 03:26.954
Who the hell
is this guy?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.439
Commander Bruce Roberts.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.908
I presided over his
autopsy 12 years ago.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.110
Some things never sat right
with me,

03:33.112 --> 03:34.962
and I want to take another look.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.281
I get it, you're bored.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.318
But you cannot go around digging
up bodies whenever you like.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.669
Well, technically,
as medical examiner,

03:41.671 --> 03:44.138
I have that authority.
Technically,

03:44.140 --> 03:45.673
you're not the medical examiner
right now.

03:45.675 --> 03:46.908
Palmer's in charge.

03:46.910 --> 03:49.060
Well, technically, that's true.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.595
You had a heart attack, Ducky.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.398
Your own doctor
told you to take a break.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.650
Why just a break?
Why not just make it permanent?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.235
After all, the world

03:57.237 --> 04:00.038
has managed to get along
just fine without me

04:00.040 --> 04:02.357
these past several months.

04:03.442 --> 04:05.159
All right.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.863
All right, let me hear it.

04:08.865 --> 04:12.500
Well, when I conducted
the commander's autopsy,

04:12.502 --> 04:15.653
I concluded that his
end was accidental.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.154
I mean, the man literally drank
himself to death one night.

04:18.156 --> 04:21.091
It seemed very straightforward.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.095
But then I read this

04:24.097 --> 04:25.797
two days ago.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.633
Since when did you
start reading the obits?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.167
Well, your day will come.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.337
In any case, I saw that
the commander's father

04:33.339 --> 04:35.223
had passed away of a rare

04:35.225 --> 04:36.724
genetic liver disorder.

04:36.726 --> 04:38.393
One that most certainly
would have been passed on

04:38.395 --> 04:39.610
to the commander.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.479
Had I known about his condition,

04:41.481 --> 04:43.731
I would have done my
autopsy differently.

04:43.733 --> 04:46.684
There is a class of
poisons that would mimic

04:46.686 --> 04:51.205
fatal alcohol intoxication in
someone with Roberts' defect.

04:51.207 --> 04:55.192
In other words, his death may
not have been an accident.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.829
It might just
have been a murder.

05:09.661 --> 05:11.929
He looks pretty peaceful
for a murder victim, huh?

05:12.431 --> 05:14.598
And for a guy about
to fly to Malta.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.633
Coach, 12 hours,

05:16.635 --> 05:18.702
packed like sardines.

05:18.704 --> 05:19.770
Ooh.

05:19.772 --> 05:21.304
It's worth it.

05:21.306 --> 05:23.023
Malta is lovely
this time of year.

05:23.025 --> 05:26.143
You know, most people don't
realize how historically rich

05:26.145 --> 05:27.745
it is despite its small size.

05:27.747 --> 05:29.630
In fact, Maltan temples

05:29.632 --> 05:32.699
are widely regarded as the
oldest free-standing structure

05:32.701 --> 05:34.251
Hey.
in the...

05:34.253 --> 05:36.904
Thank you, but we really
prefer you stop doing that.

05:36.906 --> 05:39.423
Oh. Oh, okay.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.324
That's all I really knew
about Malta anyway.

05:41.326 --> 05:45.328
But you can tell us what Ducky
was doing exhuming a body

05:45.330 --> 05:46.713
without telling Gibbs.

05:46.715 --> 05:47.931
We heard.

05:47.933 --> 05:50.217
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.386
(glove snapping)
Ziva?

05:52.388 --> 05:53.637
(snaps fingers)
Get the blinds.

05:56.591 --> 05:58.058
Okay, ha, ha, ha, yeah.

05:58.060 --> 06:01.061
(knuckles cracking)
This is all very, very, very funny.

06:01.063 --> 06:03.147
Uh... uh...

06:03.149 --> 06:05.115
(nervous laugh)

06:05.117 --> 06:06.533
(whispering):
We know you know.

06:06.535 --> 06:07.618
Look sharp.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.570
TONY:
Yeah, that black light's

06:09.572 --> 06:11.071
not gonna show
us anything.

06:15.193 --> 06:17.461
Ducky's working on a cold case,
unofficially.

06:17.463 --> 06:18.629
End of story.

06:18.631 --> 06:20.047
What about this one?

06:20.049 --> 06:21.131
Uh, boss,
meet Sergeant Raymond Hill.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.966
ZIVA:
Cabdriver was waiting outside

06:22.968 --> 06:24.084
to take him to the airport.

06:24.086 --> 06:25.252
Finally, looked in the window.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.553
Cabbie called the Po-Po,
Po-Po called us.

06:26.555 --> 06:28.472
Give me time of death?
(monitor beeps)

06:28.474 --> 06:30.557
Last night around midnight.

06:33.544 --> 06:35.879
(sighs)
In fact,

06:35.881 --> 06:37.981
I already have
a preliminary cause of death.

06:37.983 --> 06:39.183
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

06:39.185 --> 06:41.401
Um, r-right, yeah.

06:41.403 --> 06:44.404
Uh, you can tell by the
cherry-pink skin discoloration

06:44.406 --> 06:45.856
most commonly seen in the...

06:45.858 --> 06:48.391
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

06:48.393 --> 06:50.110
Okay, I will just be
right down here then.

06:50.112 --> 06:51.361
TONY: Place has
a gas furnace, boss.

06:51.363 --> 06:53.780
Looks like these hatches
were fried shut.

06:53.782 --> 06:56.233
McGEE: None of the carbon monoxide
detectors went off.

06:56.235 --> 06:57.951
But they can't all be faulty.

06:57.953 --> 06:59.069
TONY: Also found 50 grand
in the case there.

06:59.071 --> 07:00.838
McGEE: Way above the
sergeant's pay-grade.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.706
ZIVA: It's clear he'd
been freelancing.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.407
Freelancing at what?

07:04.409 --> 07:06.076
ZIVA: Sergeant Hill was assigned
to the Marine Corps

07:06.078 --> 07:08.245
Security Force Regiment
out of Yorktown.

07:08.247 --> 07:10.747
McGEE: They provide security to
high-value Naval installations.

07:10.749 --> 07:13.250
Nuclear vessels, reconnaissance
satellite facilities,

07:13.252 --> 07:14.468
the alien bones from Roswell.

07:14.470 --> 07:16.153
That was the Air Force.
Try and stay focused.

07:16.155 --> 07:17.321
The sergeant authorized
for travel?

07:17.323 --> 07:18.605
No, so he was about to go U.A.

07:18.607 --> 07:20.107
On a one-way ticket,
was he in trouble?

07:20.109 --> 07:21.391
Nope, never been arrested.

07:21.393 --> 07:23.327
Above average physical reports.

07:23.329 --> 07:24.278
I talked to his neighbors.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.662
He was quiet,
he kept to himself.

07:25.664 --> 07:26.864
TONY: Bank statements.
ZIVA: Credit cards.

07:26.866 --> 07:28.115
MCGEE: Library card.

07:28.117 --> 07:29.449
We ran everything on him
we could.

07:29.451 --> 07:30.951
The most remarkable
thing about him is

07:30.953 --> 07:32.970
how unremarkable he was.

07:32.972 --> 07:35.105
And whatever the motive
for his murder is...

07:35.107 --> 07:36.874
You got nothing.

07:36.876 --> 07:38.608
Sounds worse
when you say it like that.

07:38.610 --> 07:39.776
Not worse.

07:39.778 --> 07:41.411
Wrong.

07:41.413 --> 07:43.280
We got something.

07:43.282 --> 07:46.083
Got a dead Marine.

07:47.669 --> 07:49.503
Tell me you got
something, Abbs.

07:49.505 --> 07:50.888
I do.

07:59.097 --> 08:01.131
Much better.

08:01.133 --> 08:03.433
I don't know where to start.

08:03.435 --> 08:05.468
Well, it's just that
ever since the kaboom,

08:05.470 --> 08:07.187
you've sort of been
walking around

08:07.189 --> 08:08.522
looking like Mr. Sour Puss.

08:08.524 --> 08:09.656
But I know that
on the inside,

08:09.658 --> 08:10.824
you're one of
the kindest people I know.

08:10.826 --> 08:12.075
So, I thought it
would be nice if today,

08:12.077 --> 08:14.995
your outside
reflected your inside.

08:14.997 --> 08:16.446
I know what you did for Ducky.

08:16.448 --> 08:17.781
That was very, very sweet.

08:17.783 --> 08:21.285
All I did was retroactively
approve the exhumation.

08:21.287 --> 08:22.619
Well, it's a good thing you did

08:22.621 --> 08:25.205
because Ducky's cold case
is warming up.

08:25.207 --> 08:27.541
I ran the tissue
from the exhumed body

08:27.543 --> 08:29.259
against the class of poisons
that Ducky suspected,

08:29.261 --> 08:30.394
and he was right.

08:30.396 --> 08:31.661
The commander was murdered

08:31.663 --> 08:35.249
with a poison called
hepatic glycoside oleandrin.

08:35.251 --> 08:37.100
Where do you get it?
Nowhere.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.001
It has to be synthesized
from the oleander plant,

08:39.004 --> 08:40.386
which is everywhere.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.105
And with Commander Roberts'
genetic condition,

08:42.107 --> 08:43.974
the poison made his death
look like

08:43.976 --> 08:46.109
Fatal alcohol intoxication.
Yup.

08:46.111 --> 08:48.695
The next part
you're gonna love... or hate.

08:48.697 --> 08:50.697
After I finished
Ducky's cold case,

08:50.699 --> 08:52.182
I started working
on your hot one.

08:52.184 --> 08:54.484
I took a look at
Sergeant Hill's laptop and found

08:54.486 --> 08:57.704
a copy of Ducky's
exhumation order.

08:57.706 --> 08:59.656
What was Hill doing with it?

08:59.658 --> 09:01.408
Not my department.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.461
I just know that your new dead
guy was really interested

09:04.463 --> 09:07.247
in the old dead guy
that Ducky was digging up.

09:07.249 --> 09:10.550
In fact, Ducky's exhumation
order is one of the last things

09:10.552 --> 09:12.135
that Hill looked at
before he was killed.

09:12.137 --> 09:14.638
What are the odds, Gibbs?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.391
DUCKY: What's a copy of
my exhumation order

09:17.393 --> 09:19.509
doing on Hill's computer?
GIBBS: I don't know.

09:19.511 --> 09:21.011
DUCKY: How'd he get it?
GIBBS: I don't know.

09:21.013 --> 09:22.262
And what's the connection

09:22.264 --> 09:25.098
between Sergeant Hill
and my cold case?

09:25.100 --> 09:27.017
Ducky, I don't know.

09:27.019 --> 09:28.819
Well, unfortunately,
neither do I,

09:28.821 --> 09:31.688
which, I presume,
is why you're here.

09:31.690 --> 09:35.942
However, clearly the
two cases must be connected.

09:35.944 --> 09:38.028
Which means we finally
have a lead on the hot case.

09:38.030 --> 09:42.732
Aw, that's fantastic.

09:46.704 --> 09:48.755
Gonna need a list
of the people you talked to

09:48.757 --> 09:50.991
about the exhumation, Duck.
Of course.

09:50.993 --> 09:53.910
And we're going to need all the
files you have on the cold case.

09:53.912 --> 09:55.212
Yes, I understand.

09:55.214 --> 09:59.633
Since I am not officially
reinstated as medical examiner,

09:59.635 --> 10:04.638
regulations bar me from working
on any active investigation.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.106
As medical examiner.

10:06.108 --> 10:07.107
That's what I just said.

10:07.109 --> 10:09.426
In any medical capacity.

10:09.428 --> 10:12.396
The horse is dead, Jethro.

10:12.398 --> 10:15.432
I'd appreciate it if you
would stop beating it.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.541
Rule 38.

10:25.827 --> 10:27.110
Boss?

10:28.162 --> 10:29.413
What?

10:31.883 --> 10:33.616
Rule 38?

10:33.618 --> 10:37.838
Your case, you're lead.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.561
Let's go.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.738
TONY: So Ducky's cold case didn't
kill himself, he was murdered.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.289
According to Abby.

10:56.291 --> 10:57.490
I'm sorry, I don't buy it.

10:57.492 --> 10:58.941
She is rarely
wrong, Tony.

10:58.943 --> 11:01.544
Nah, it's... I don't doubt
that Abby found the poison.

11:01.546 --> 11:05.832
It's just... have you seen
the Duckman moping around?

11:05.834 --> 11:08.718
I mean, ten bucks says the old
coot planted the poison himself

11:08.720 --> 11:10.720
so that he could
drum up some business.

11:10.722 --> 11:12.055
Coot?

11:13.007 --> 11:14.924
I hope you're referring
to the aquatic bird

11:14.926 --> 11:17.844
with vigorously strong
hind legs.

11:17.846 --> 11:19.512
And sex life, yes, I was.

11:19.514 --> 11:21.681
Ah.

11:21.683 --> 11:23.183
Can we help you, Ducky?

11:23.185 --> 11:25.301
I hope so--
Ducky has point.

11:26.136 --> 11:27.320
Excuse me?

11:27.322 --> 11:28.588
The cold case is
our best lead.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.006
It was Ducky's case.

11:30.008 --> 11:31.307
Ducky has point.

11:31.309 --> 11:32.442
(chuckles)

11:32.444 --> 11:33.660
Rule 38.

11:33.662 --> 11:35.445
Yeah, but he's not a...
you can't do a...

11:35.447 --> 11:36.863
Oh, got it.

11:36.865 --> 11:38.031
Then, let's get going, shall we?

11:38.033 --> 11:42.418
Uh, there is evil afoot
that must be cast asunder.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.840
TONY:
Okay.

11:46.842 --> 11:49.175
Navy Commander
Bruce Roberts

11:49.177 --> 11:50.376
was found dead 12 years ago.

11:50.378 --> 11:51.711
It was ruled
an accidental death.

11:51.713 --> 11:52.946
Now, it's been
reclassified a murder,

11:52.948 --> 11:54.464
courtesy of Abby Sciuto.

11:54.466 --> 11:55.799
McGEE:
At the time of his death,

11:55.801 --> 11:58.518
he taught avionics at
the Naval Academy in Annapolis.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.271
Uh, his record shows he
applied to aviation school,

12:01.273 --> 12:02.605
various flight programs,

12:02.607 --> 12:05.892
even NASA's Astronaut
Training Program several times.

12:05.894 --> 12:08.094
But, uh,
he was repeatedly denied.

12:08.096 --> 12:09.946
Mm-mm.

12:11.265 --> 12:14.334
Oh.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.688
Duck.

12:18.690 --> 12:21.524
Oh, uh, personal life?

12:21.526 --> 12:23.877
Roberts came from
old family money.

12:23.879 --> 12:25.829
He-e-e-e inherited a bundle.

12:25.831 --> 12:27.747
Uh, always lived
far below his means.

12:27.749 --> 12:29.031
Wife deceased.

12:29.033 --> 12:30.366
One grown daughter.

12:30.368 --> 12:32.652
Well, it would be prudent
to talk with her.

12:32.654 --> 12:33.887
She's already on her way, Ducky.

12:33.889 --> 12:35.338
DUCKY:
Oh, uh...

12:35.340 --> 12:40.042
And comb the archives for any
old evidence from my cold case.

12:40.044 --> 12:42.145
There must be something there.

12:43.814 --> 12:45.715
Well?

12:51.388 --> 12:52.939
I think I'm gonna like this.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.860
Thank you.
Hello.

12:56.862 --> 12:59.495
I'm Special Agent Ziva David,
this is Dr. Mallard.

12:59.497 --> 13:00.680
Thank you for coming.

13:00.682 --> 13:02.332
I'm still not sure why I'm here.

13:02.334 --> 13:05.285
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your father.

13:06.170 --> 13:08.838
My father, why?

13:08.840 --> 13:11.090
He's been dead
for over 12 years.

13:11.092 --> 13:12.792
It is about the circumstances
of his death.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.296
Well, that's easy.

13:16.298 --> 13:18.548
He's dead because I killed him.

13:20.851 --> 13:22.135
I beg your pardon?

13:22.137 --> 13:23.286
I was...

13:23.288 --> 13:26.589
I was supposed to stop over
the night he died.

13:26.591 --> 13:29.926
But I had to work late.

13:29.928 --> 13:31.277
And if I had been there,

13:31.279 --> 13:32.595
he never would have
drank that much.

13:32.597 --> 13:34.514
Because he wasn't really
a drinker, he was

13:34.516 --> 13:36.332
just having a bad day.

13:36.334 --> 13:39.652
Ever since he was a kid, my dad
was a really big space buff,

13:39.654 --> 13:44.240
and every few years he would
apply for this position at NASA.

13:44.242 --> 13:47.577
And he'd just received
his latest rejection.

13:47.579 --> 13:48.912
Yeah.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.832
Ellen,
your father's death

13:52.834 --> 13:54.450
was not an accident.

13:54.452 --> 13:56.903
Of course it was.

13:56.905 --> 13:58.221
Of course it was!

13:58.223 --> 14:00.506
He was...
no, my-my dad would never...

14:00.508 --> 14:02.926
No, no, no,
you-you misunderstand.

14:02.928 --> 14:05.511
You see, we believe

14:05.513 --> 14:07.897
your father was murdered.

14:07.899 --> 14:10.667
It's not your fault.

14:10.669 --> 14:12.418
It never was your fault.

14:12.420 --> 14:15.421
(sighs)

14:15.423 --> 14:17.740
Wha...

14:17.742 --> 14:19.993
Who-who killed him? Why?

14:19.995 --> 14:22.078
That is what we're trying
to find out.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.231
Do you know this man?

14:25.233 --> 14:26.783
No.

14:26.785 --> 14:28.201
Who-who is he?

14:28.203 --> 14:30.336
He's someone who's very
interested in our investigation

14:30.338 --> 14:32.872
into your father's death.

14:32.874 --> 14:35.375
We need to find out why.

14:37.962 --> 14:39.178
D-d-don't worry.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.164
We'll get to the bottom
of things.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.117
I promise.

14:44.119 --> 14:47.437
whatever happened to your father
will be avenged.

14:49.657 --> 14:52.341
Thank you.

14:53.444 --> 14:56.863
Will you excuse me,
I have, um...

14:56.865 --> 15:00.033
Here, oh, it's just outside.

15:00.035 --> 15:02.535
Agent Dakota will show you.

15:06.023 --> 15:07.490
Well, that was emotional.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.509
I suppose

15:09.511 --> 15:11.961
I'm not used to dealing
with the living.

15:11.963 --> 15:13.129
I noticed.

15:13.131 --> 15:16.082
Ducky, you should
not make a promise

15:16.084 --> 15:17.417
you might not be able to keep.

15:17.419 --> 15:18.718
I'm certainly gonna try.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.053
I'm sure, but she

15:20.055 --> 15:22.972
inherited $4 million
when her father died.

15:22.974 --> 15:24.891
She might actually
be the murderer.

15:29.013 --> 15:31.380
JIMMY: You know, exhumations
are generally frowned upon

15:31.382 --> 15:33.016
by most cultures
that bury their dead.

15:33.018 --> 15:35.018
Great.
But in Vietnam,

15:35.020 --> 15:36.569
after several years,
the graves are dug up

15:36.571 --> 15:39.221
and bones reburied
in a ceramic pot.

15:39.223 --> 15:41.157
That's Taiwan,
not Vietnam.

15:41.159 --> 15:42.992
I warned you
about Wikipedia.

15:42.994 --> 15:45.411
Dr. Mallard, how
awesome you're here.

15:45.413 --> 15:47.113
Again.
Duck?

15:47.115 --> 15:50.283
Relax, Jethro,
I'm not here as M.E.

15:50.285 --> 15:53.086
Purely in my
consultant capacity.

15:53.088 --> 15:54.904
I wish to be briefed.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.924
Well, I was just about
to tell Agent Gibbs

15:57.926 --> 15:59.709
about some nasty ol'
chemical burns

15:59.711 --> 16:02.178
I found on Sergeant Hill,
our most recent victim.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.713
They appear to
be quite old.

16:03.715 --> 16:05.548
I'd say over a
decade, at least.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.917
These X-rays are blurry.

16:07.919 --> 16:09.685
Yeah, I know,
I can't figure that out.

16:09.687 --> 16:10.970
I took them three times.

16:10.972 --> 16:12.722
How many times have
I told you, Mr. Palmer,

16:12.724 --> 16:13.923
don't use the A.E....

16:13.925 --> 16:15.441
Ducky.

16:16.259 --> 16:18.611
Oh.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.982
Uh, part of the burn
appears to be

16:22.984 --> 16:26.352
from by a round-bottom
chemical flask, which

16:26.354 --> 16:28.421
makes sense, um,
these are chemical burns.

16:28.423 --> 16:30.073
From what?

16:30.075 --> 16:31.958
Well, that's not possible
to determine from...

16:31.960 --> 16:33.409
I actually was able
to work backward

16:33.411 --> 16:34.827
from the contracture
of the scarring

16:34.829 --> 16:36.412
to establish a likely pH

16:36.414 --> 16:38.464
and molarity level
of the chemicals involved.

16:38.466 --> 16:41.134
Ah, mmm, clever.

16:42.619 --> 16:43.719
What am I looking at?

16:43.721 --> 16:45.588
The short-list.

16:45.590 --> 16:46.889
These chemicals are all
precursors to hepatic

16:46.891 --> 16:48.224
glycoside oleandrin.

16:48.226 --> 16:49.909
The poison that killed Roberts.
Mm-hmm.

16:49.911 --> 16:51.844
Sergeant Hill
likely got these scars

16:51.846 --> 16:55.481
in a makeshift lab while
trying to create this poison.

16:55.483 --> 16:56.933
Making him...

16:56.935 --> 16:59.185
our prime suspect.

16:59.187 --> 17:02.638
Oh, that's very clever.

17:03.657 --> 17:04.924
Okay, you've been briefed.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.442
What do you got?
Well, presuming that

17:06.444 --> 17:08.911
Sergeant Hill
was indeed the killer,

17:08.913 --> 17:10.997
that would explain
why he was running.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.832
I was exhuming his old victim.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.334
He had to be concerned
that my inquiry would

17:15.336 --> 17:17.086
lead back to him, as it has.

17:17.088 --> 17:18.287
But...

17:18.289 --> 17:19.505
(alarm blaring)

17:19.507 --> 17:20.790
That's the radiation alarm.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.593
That's the code for Abby's lab.

17:23.595 --> 17:26.162
No, no,
don't evacuate the building.

17:26.164 --> 17:28.047
(alarm blaring, bell ringing)
It was a false alarm.

17:28.049 --> 17:30.183
It was a
false alarm!

17:30.185 --> 17:31.517
(alarm stops)
Hey.

17:31.519 --> 17:33.102
You okay?
(frustrated groan)

17:33.104 --> 17:35.188
No.

17:35.190 --> 17:38.141
Almost blew out my eardrum.

17:38.143 --> 17:39.475
(loud music begins playing)

17:39.477 --> 17:40.676
Much better.

17:40.678 --> 17:41.894
I don't know
if you noticed, Gibbs,

17:41.896 --> 17:43.312
but my radiation alarm went off.

17:43.314 --> 17:45.198
(music stops)
Abbs,

17:45.200 --> 17:47.366
the dead guys
in Autopsy noticed.

17:47.368 --> 17:49.785
Okay, you can relax.

17:49.787 --> 17:51.404
Because my
sensors did detect

17:51.406 --> 17:53.206
a radiation source
on the evidence,

17:53.208 --> 17:55.408
but the amount was too
small to be dangerous.

17:55.410 --> 17:57.326
I just think that my
sensitivity knobs

17:57.328 --> 18:00.246
have been turned up to 11
ever since the big kaboom.

18:00.248 --> 18:03.199
Abbs, this the uniform Roberts
was wearing when he was buried?

18:03.201 --> 18:07.103
The dead 12-year-old
mold give it away?

18:07.105 --> 18:09.705
Yeah, so, I found an odd
dust in the fibers.

18:09.707 --> 18:11.974
It appeared volcanic.

18:11.976 --> 18:14.710
I was able to identify
its origin before

18:14.712 --> 18:16.729
my alarm woke the dead.

18:16.731 --> 18:20.216
Gibbs, meet JSC-1,

18:20.218 --> 18:23.236
a lunar-soil simulant.

18:23.238 --> 18:24.320
What?

18:24.322 --> 18:26.555
Well, basically,
it's a cocktail

18:26.557 --> 18:29.158
of lava and rock
that's mixed together to

18:29.160 --> 18:31.310
mimic the soil on the Moon.

18:31.312 --> 18:33.279
NASA researchers cooked it up

18:33.281 --> 18:34.614
decades ago for

18:34.616 --> 18:36.249
NASA research.

18:36.251 --> 18:37.717
What was Roberts doing with it?

18:37.719 --> 18:39.902
I have no clue.

18:39.904 --> 18:43.506
I also don't know why it
irradiated and set off my alarm.

18:43.508 --> 18:46.209
However, I did manage to find

18:46.211 --> 18:49.045
the one guy in town
who would know.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.431
Bring me a souvenir, please.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.754
BLACKWELL:
<i>JSC-1, huh?</i>

18:58.756 --> 19:02.225
Nope, haven't seen
it in years.

19:02.227 --> 19:03.559
You sure?

19:03.561 --> 19:05.427
Well, that is what we were
hoping you could tell us.

19:05.429 --> 19:06.762
Let me see, let me see,
let me see.

19:06.764 --> 19:07.897
(clears throat)

19:07.899 --> 19:09.065
What have we got here?

19:09.067 --> 19:12.084
Huh? Pyroxene,

19:12.086 --> 19:15.705
plagioclase crystals...

19:17.440 --> 19:21.627
You know the funny thing
about plagioclase crystals?

19:21.629 --> 19:22.828
No.

19:22.830 --> 19:26.716
Neither do the aluminosilicates.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.952
(wheezy laugh)

19:32.589 --> 19:34.890
Neither do the alu...

19:34.892 --> 19:36.926
(scoffs)
Never mind.

19:36.928 --> 19:38.060
Yep, that's the real deal.

19:38.062 --> 19:39.128
Which is what exactly?

19:39.130 --> 19:43.316
JSC stands for
Johnson Space Center,

19:43.318 --> 19:46.569
where this fake Moon
rock was created.

19:46.571 --> 19:49.972
NASA needed a knockoff because
the real stuff was way

19:49.974 --> 19:54.894
too expensive for their
lunar engineering studies.

19:54.896 --> 19:57.096
And this material
was, uh, radioactive?

19:57.098 --> 19:58.831
Oh, not inherently.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.667
A few researchers irradiated

20:01.669 --> 20:04.170
some JSC to test its ability

20:04.172 --> 20:06.756
to withstand solar radiation.

20:06.758 --> 20:08.541
Show-offs, mostly.

20:08.543 --> 20:10.009
Where do you think
Commander Roberts

20:10.011 --> 20:11.493
might have gotten it?

20:11.495 --> 20:12.712
He could've come across

20:12.714 --> 20:16.515
regular JSC in any number
of university labs.

20:16.517 --> 20:17.917
It was unregulated.

20:17.919 --> 20:19.668
Even the irradiated stuff?

20:19.670 --> 20:21.170
No, no, no.

20:21.172 --> 20:25.391
No, great care was taken
to dispose of any JSC

20:25.393 --> 20:27.843
that was irradiated.

20:27.845 --> 20:30.146
I mean, the only thing
it would be good for

20:30.148 --> 20:32.064
is to make your lawn glow

20:32.066 --> 20:34.984
as some kind of
depraved party trick.

20:34.986 --> 20:36.319
(laughs)

20:38.688 --> 20:42.575
That and making a dirty bomb.

20:51.648 --> 20:55.083
12 years ago,
Commander Roberts was murdered.

20:55.085 --> 20:56.920
I presided over his autopsy.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.004
I'm sorry, which one is Roberts?

20:58.006 --> 21:00.339
Uh, the one
with the deviated septum.

21:00.341 --> 21:02.341
Ah.
And which one is that?

21:05.295 --> 21:06.379
Ah, okay,

21:06.381 --> 21:08.247
got it:
Roberts, murdered.

21:08.249 --> 21:12.051
We now suspect that Roberts
was killed 12 years ago

21:12.053 --> 21:17.223
by Sergeant Hill,
then Private Hill,

21:17.225 --> 21:19.925
Nice of you to join us,
Agent DiNozzo.

21:19.927 --> 21:22.111
Sorry, I was just in...
Now, where was I?

21:22.113 --> 21:23.696
Moon dirt.
Ah, right.

21:23.698 --> 21:26.365
We also learned
that when Roberts

21:26.367 --> 21:28.034
was killed 12 years ago,

21:28.036 --> 21:30.903
he was in possession
of a radioactive

21:30.905 --> 21:33.856
lunar-soil simulant
called JSC-1.

21:33.858 --> 21:36.108
With enough,
it could be used

21:36.110 --> 21:37.493
to make a dirty bomb.

21:37.495 --> 21:38.610
(whispers):
Which one's Roberts?

21:38.612 --> 21:39.795
The one with
the deviated septum.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.998
All of which begs
the question...

21:42.000 --> 21:43.949
What was Roberts planning
doing with the fake Moon dirt?

21:43.951 --> 21:46.002
Why did Hill kill him
12 years ago?

21:46.004 --> 21:47.837
And who killed Hill
two days ago?

21:47.839 --> 21:49.005
Okay, three questions.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.506
So, where to start?

21:50.508 --> 21:51.590
That's four questions.

21:51.592 --> 21:53.009
Uh, Commander Roberts.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.460
He's the key.

21:54.462 --> 21:56.045
Um, uh, if I may...

21:56.047 --> 21:57.963
Thank you very much.

21:57.965 --> 22:00.599
ZIVA: Commander Roberts
was a decorated Navy officer

22:00.601 --> 22:03.319
and a teacher,
<i>not</i> a terrorist, so...

22:03.321 --> 22:05.271
what could he want
with a dirty bomb?

22:05.273 --> 22:07.147
He wasn't selling it--
didn't need the money.

22:07.172 --> 22:07.691
The guy was loaded.

22:07.692 --> 22:10.259
DUCKY: Well, there's clearly more
to this man than meets the eye.

22:10.261 --> 22:12.661
While Mr. Palmer
attempts to reconstruct

22:12.663 --> 22:14.113
his physical reality,

22:14.115 --> 22:16.415
we need more data to construct

22:16.417 --> 22:21.087
a viable schema of his interior
psychological state.

22:21.922 --> 22:23.322
Which means?

22:24.157 --> 22:26.459
Go talk to his old C.O.

22:26.461 --> 22:27.826
Excellent idea.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.161
Hey, Duck.

22:29.163 --> 22:30.262
(gasps)

22:30.264 --> 22:31.714
Nice catch.

22:31.716 --> 22:33.332
(chuckles)

22:33.334 --> 22:35.885
(multiple guns firing)

22:41.858 --> 22:45.177
TONY: She looks pretty fiery.
Better let me handle this one.

22:45.179 --> 22:47.613
MAN:
Cease fire!

22:47.615 --> 22:49.281
MAN: Shooters,
safe and vent your weapons!

22:49.283 --> 22:51.383
TONY: Mmm.
MAN: You may now check your target!

22:51.385 --> 22:53.619
Nice shootin', Tex.

22:53.621 --> 22:56.439
I'm Special Agent DiNozzo. This is...
Yeah, I know.

22:56.441 --> 22:58.190
The boys from NCIS.

22:58.192 --> 23:01.744
If you think I'm gonna trample
on a man's grave, forget it.

23:01.803 --> 23:04.400
I'm sorry, did I say "trample"?
Did you say "trample"?

23:04.401 --> 23:07.200
I know what trample looks like,
and you got trample written all over you.

23:07.201 --> 23:09.168
MAN: Shooters, make ready!
Now, step back.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.753
Guns aren't toys.

23:10.755 --> 23:12.704
MAN: Lock and load!
Way to handle that.

23:12.706 --> 23:13.973
MAN:
Ready on the line!

23:13.975 --> 23:15.641
MAN:
Commence fire!

23:19.646 --> 23:21.981
MAN:
Cease fire! Cease fire!

23:23.700 --> 23:26.452
Trying to impress me?

23:26.454 --> 23:28.654
Think I just did.

23:28.656 --> 23:30.906
MAN:
Check your target!

23:31.741 --> 23:33.742
What can I
tell you?

23:33.744 --> 23:35.911
Like I said on the phone,
Commander Roberts

23:35.913 --> 23:38.614
was my finest officer.
But nobody's perfect.

23:38.616 --> 23:39.412
What's your point?

23:39.437 --> 23:41.200
What were some of
those imperfections?

23:42.536 --> 23:44.620
He didn't take rejection well.

23:44.622 --> 23:46.630
Are you talking about his
flight school applications?

23:46.654 --> 23:48.967
Flight school,
astronaut training, yeah.

23:49.076 --> 23:50.376
After the third rejection,

23:50.378 --> 23:51.877
he started writing
me these letters.

23:51.879 --> 23:53.546
There weren't any
in his file.

23:53.548 --> 23:55.181
That's because I pulled them.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.882
They didn't reflect
well-and-faithful

23:56.884 --> 23:58.417
discharging of his duties.

23:58.419 --> 23:59.518
Which means...?

23:59.520 --> 24:02.188
He started making...
veiled threats.

24:02.190 --> 24:05.141
Saying the DoD would be
sorry they rejected him.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.944
But he was just
letting off some steam.

24:08.946 --> 24:10.779
I didn't... think
it was necessary.

24:10.781 --> 24:13.599
I didn't see any point
to tarnishing his record.

24:13.601 --> 24:16.368
Do you have a copy
of those letters?

24:16.370 --> 24:19.488
Of course I do.

24:19.490 --> 24:20.926
You have been a very bad

24:20.951 --> 24:23.071
carbon monoxide smoke
detector combo unit.

24:23.077 --> 24:24.793
Well, define "bad."
Be happy to,

24:24.795 --> 24:26.495
though it might get
a little technical.

24:26.497 --> 24:29.331
And Ducky already
beat you to it.

24:29.333 --> 24:32.835
But I will find a home
for that inside...

24:32.837 --> 24:34.737
Oops.
...myself.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.889
Yeah.

24:36.891 --> 24:38.707
Smoke detector.
Well, I figured out

24:38.709 --> 24:41.293
how Sergeant Hill's smoke
detector malfunctioned.

24:41.295 --> 24:43.429
It connects with the
thermostat wirelessly,

24:43.431 --> 24:46.932
and someone <i>remotely</i> infected
the entire system with a virus.

24:46.934 --> 24:49.627
That caused the furnace's
exhaust fan to short out,

24:49.652 --> 24:50.737
and it disabled the alarm.

24:50.738 --> 24:54.406
Item number two:
Commander Roberts' old PC.

24:54.408 --> 24:56.325
The hard drive
is corrupted,

24:56.327 --> 24:59.228
but I think I found our missing
link between our victims.

24:59.230 --> 25:00.646
(keyboard clacking)

25:02.282 --> 25:04.650
GIBBS: They were e-mailing
each other 12 years ago.

25:04.652 --> 25:06.535
Yeah, it looks like they were
arranging some sort of buy.

25:06.537 --> 25:08.420
I think Commander
Roberts was the buyer

25:08.422 --> 25:10.155
and Sergeant Hill
was the seller.

25:10.157 --> 25:12.658
Any idea what he was selling?
No, but...

25:12.660 --> 25:14.009
I think it's illegal
because Roberts was

25:14.011 --> 25:15.811
really paranoid
about the police.

25:15.813 --> 25:18.264
Dirty bombs are illegal.
Yeah,

25:18.266 --> 25:21.800
maybe Sergeant Hill was part
of some WMD smuggling ring.

25:21.802 --> 25:24.336
I think something went
wrong with the sale,

25:24.338 --> 25:25.854
because in the next e-mail

25:25.856 --> 25:27.806
Roberts threatens
to turn Hill in

25:27.808 --> 25:29.007
to the Feds.

25:29.009 --> 25:30.392
Three days later,

25:30.394 --> 25:32.361
Roberts was murdered.
Yeah.

25:32.363 --> 25:33.812
What worries me is that

25:33.814 --> 25:36.181
Sergeant Hill was just killed
two days ago,

25:36.183 --> 25:38.284
so is this smuggling ring
still active?

25:38.286 --> 25:39.652
Abbs, can you take
this new info

25:39.654 --> 25:41.370
and find out if Hill
had any other buyers?

25:41.372 --> 25:42.571
They might
know something.

25:42.573 --> 25:43.906
Of course.

25:45.692 --> 25:49.011
WMD smuggling ring,
here I come.

25:49.746 --> 25:51.196
JIMMY:
<i>Agent Gibbs.</i>

25:51.198 --> 25:53.031
Agent Gibbs, I am sorry

25:53.033 --> 25:55.301
to barge in like
this, but...

25:55.303 --> 25:57.386
I'm afraid that Dr. Mallard
is losing it.

25:57.388 --> 25:59.871
The other day,
he actually yelled at me.

25:59.873 --> 26:01.924
And then once Commander
Roberts' body shows up,

26:01.926 --> 26:04.293
he starts issuing orders
like he's Attila the Hun...

26:04.295 --> 26:06.645
(object clatters)

26:10.483 --> 26:13.185
Dr. Mallard! Hi.

26:13.187 --> 26:14.987
(chuckles nervously)

26:14.989 --> 26:16.188
Mr. Palmer.

26:16.190 --> 26:18.607
See, that-that...
that was just...

26:18.609 --> 26:20.943
that, uh, I w... I was, um...

26:20.945 --> 26:22.060
Wishing you weren't here?

26:22.062 --> 26:24.396
Yeah. Um...

26:24.398 --> 26:26.582
Gentlemen.

26:30.837 --> 26:34.089
Mr. Palmer is managing
quite admirably.

26:34.091 --> 26:36.258
However, he is slightly
overwhelmed

26:36.260 --> 26:37.876
(door opens, closes)
with his new position.

26:37.878 --> 26:39.845
Something I can relate to.

26:39.847 --> 26:41.580
You're doing great, Duck.

26:41.582 --> 26:43.382
You may have single-handedly
uncovered

26:43.384 --> 26:45.634
a WMD smuggling ring.
Yes,

26:45.636 --> 26:47.753
but I promised Commander
Roberts' daughter

26:47.755 --> 26:49.171
that her father's death

26:49.173 --> 26:50.839
would be avenged.
Now I might

26:50.841 --> 26:52.941
have to tell her
that he's a terrorist.

26:52.943 --> 26:56.195
I don't know how you do it.
Is that why you're here?

26:56.197 --> 26:58.530
To find out how I do it?

26:58.532 --> 26:59.598
"Avenged."

26:59.600 --> 27:01.867
I mean, who even talks
like that?

27:01.869 --> 27:04.320
Someone who cares.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.905
It's 99% of the game.

27:06.907 --> 27:09.892
Yeah, well, it's a game
I fear I underestimated.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.061
My cold case

27:12.063 --> 27:14.830
is about to turn into a hot one.

27:14.832 --> 27:17.949
Lives could be on the line.
Well,

27:17.951 --> 27:19.885
won't be the first time.
But now

27:19.887 --> 27:22.971
I have a front row seat, and
I'm not sure I'm up to the task.

27:22.973 --> 27:26.258
A task that you handle
with such aplomb,

27:26.260 --> 27:30.696
even when the building where
you work explodes around you.

27:30.698 --> 27:33.315
(chuckles)
Funny.

27:33.317 --> 27:37.436
I was dismayed that the world
could get on without me.

27:38.271 --> 27:39.822
Now, it seems...

27:39.824 --> 27:42.741
well, it just might
be better off.

27:42.743 --> 27:46.578
(phone ringing)

27:48.415 --> 27:49.815
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

27:49.817 --> 27:51.784
ABBY: Can you come in?
I found another buyer.

27:51.786 --> 27:54.370
Yeah, Abbs. I'll be right there.

27:55.171 --> 27:57.256
Abby found another buyer.

28:16.893 --> 28:18.026
Stop it, Tony.

28:18.028 --> 28:20.028
(laughs)
It's not funny.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.730
Who's laughing?

28:21.732 --> 28:23.699
Talk to me.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.350
(chuckling)

28:25.352 --> 28:27.786
It's nothing, boss.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.288
Mm.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.989
(snorts)

28:30.991 --> 28:33.592
I thought I was picked
to be a beta tester

28:33.594 --> 28:35.294
in this thing...
(laughs)

28:35.296 --> 28:38.130
Just got an e-mail saying
that it was a mistake.

28:38.132 --> 28:39.381
It was no mistake,

28:39.383 --> 28:41.784
because you got to <i>have</i> a life
to get a life recorder.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.502
What?

28:43.504 --> 28:44.720
Second buyer.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.638
DiNozzo. You.
Talk to me.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.507
I'm sorry, I had
a lot of sugar.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.576
Abby dug up an old e-mail
from Sergeant Hill

28:50.578 --> 28:52.928
discussing another sale.
McGEE: The buyer didn't use his name.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.396
He just signed
it as "D.F".

28:54.398 --> 28:56.148
We traced the e-mail
to a cell phone,

28:56.150 --> 28:58.400
which led to a P.O. box.
Which led you here.

28:58.402 --> 29:01.153
And whoever he is, he's pretty
good at staying off the grid.

29:01.155 --> 29:03.605
No credit cards,
no aliases on his DMV record,

29:03.607 --> 29:05.858
(chuckling):
no life, really.

29:06.826 --> 29:08.777
What's he hiding?

29:08.779 --> 29:12.331
I don't know, but his electricity use
is way above the norm.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.732
He's doing something
up there.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.851
There's an entry around back.
(Tony and McGee gasp)

29:15.853 --> 29:17.736
You enjoy doing that?

29:17.738 --> 29:19.838
A little, yes.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.340
Someone's
definitely inside.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.208
Ziva, McGee,
take the back.

29:23.210 --> 29:24.743
DiNozzo, come on.

29:24.745 --> 29:26.862
(Tony sighs)

29:26.864 --> 29:29.047
(rock music playing in distance)

29:30.467 --> 29:33.619
McGee bet me ten bucks
it was... gunrunners.

29:33.621 --> 29:36.054
(click) I don't think it's gunrunners.
I think it's counterfeiters.

29:36.056 --> 29:38.190
Oh, lookie there.

29:41.528 --> 29:43.762
(rock music blaring)

29:45.031 --> 29:47.599
NCIS!

29:47.601 --> 29:51.069
(rock music continues blaring)

29:55.492 --> 29:57.543
TONY:
Freeze!

29:57.545 --> 29:59.545
Not this again!
Bloody hell!

29:59.547 --> 30:00.796
McGee!

30:00.798 --> 30:01.747
Going someplace?

30:01.749 --> 30:03.465
Not in the face, all right?

30:03.467 --> 30:06.718
Anything but the face!
ZIVA: No one's going to touch your face.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.053
(music stops)

30:08.888 --> 30:10.288
NCIS.

30:10.290 --> 30:12.307
You're cops?
Cops are cool.

30:12.309 --> 30:14.593
I love cops. I mean,
I'm very, very fond of

30:14.595 --> 30:16.595
the police department.
In fact, I did a benefit concert

30:16.597 --> 30:18.180
for the Springfield
Police Department.

30:18.182 --> 30:20.599
Made 'em a lot of money.
(chuckles)

30:20.601 --> 30:22.634
What's the charges?

30:22.636 --> 30:23.969
A benefit concert?

30:23.971 --> 30:25.871
Rock and roll!

30:25.873 --> 30:27.305
Right?

30:27.307 --> 30:28.640
Live Aid!

30:28.642 --> 30:30.742
Don't you
remember this?

30:30.744 --> 30:32.361
Biggest concert
of all time.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.284
Remember that?

30:42.205 --> 30:45.624
I think I need to call my agent.
(chuckles)

30:56.872 --> 31:01.409
(British accent): Our rock and roll god
goes by the name of Del Finney.

31:01.411 --> 31:04.229
(normal voice): But his real name
is Otto Smeleznin...

31:04.231 --> 31:06.931
Smeleznizincochfunchin.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.900
Funchtinscotchkin.

31:08.902 --> 31:10.368
Whatever. He's a musician.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.170
Guy was a one-hit
wonder in the '80s,

31:12.172 --> 31:14.389
but by the '90s he'd blown
through all his dough.

31:14.391 --> 31:15.674
What about now?
Now,

31:15.676 --> 31:17.058
he is a maintenance man

31:17.060 --> 31:18.843
for the building
we found him in.

31:18.845 --> 31:21.479
He doesn't look very...
terroristic.

31:21.481 --> 31:23.315
GIBBS: He's into something.
Whatever it is,

31:23.317 --> 31:24.382
he's not talking.

31:24.384 --> 31:25.767
Or singing.

31:27.770 --> 31:29.354
Duck.

31:29.356 --> 31:31.523
After you.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.946
This should be entertaining.

31:42.335 --> 31:45.036
Hello, Mr.
Smeleznovichik.

31:45.038 --> 31:47.505
Uh, Finney.

31:47.507 --> 31:49.457
Del Finney.

31:49.459 --> 31:51.926
Do you know this man?

31:54.296 --> 31:57.415
I can't say that I do, no.
Really?

31:57.417 --> 32:00.518
I can see your carotid artery
pulsing in your neck.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.887
The moment this
photo appeared,

32:02.889 --> 32:06.257
your heart rate
shot up to, ooh...

32:06.259 --> 32:09.260
I'd estimate 130.

32:09.262 --> 32:11.279
You bought something
from this guy.

32:11.281 --> 32:13.398
What was it?
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.483
Why'd you run?
I thought you were fans.

32:15.485 --> 32:17.869
I mean, Th-that's why I've
been keeping a low profile.

32:17.871 --> 32:20.038
You know...
It can't get much lower.

32:21.207 --> 32:24.609
I was big once, okay?

32:24.611 --> 32:26.711
I had the number
three single

32:26.713 --> 32:28.546
for six weeks in 1982.

32:28.548 --> 32:30.048
You would not believe

32:30.050 --> 32:33.802
the people on my doorstep
wanting my autograph, okay?

32:33.804 --> 32:38.122
Or looking for payments
on overdue bills.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.142
You owe a lot of
people a lot of money.

32:41.144 --> 32:44.145
Are you hiding from fans?

32:44.147 --> 32:48.016
Or from creditors,
Mr. Smeleznovichik?

32:48.018 --> 32:49.967
My name is... Finney.
Finney.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.269
Yeah. Del Finney.

32:51.271 --> 32:53.488
(laughs)
My apologies.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.493
It must be really hard for you.

32:58.495 --> 33:00.311
I mean, so
much talent,

33:00.313 --> 33:02.280
the adulation,

33:02.282 --> 33:04.482
and now it's... all over.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.317
(laughs):
I mean,

33:06.319 --> 33:08.653
(chuckling):
what happened?

33:10.506 --> 33:12.707
(sighs)

33:14.844 --> 33:17.679
I bought a zoo.

33:18.848 --> 33:21.099
And I bought a lighthouse.

33:22.718 --> 33:25.002
Few other things, you know.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.005
Then the checks...

33:28.007 --> 33:31.008
they stopped coming in,
you know, so I was...

33:31.010 --> 33:33.111
You buy that other stuff
from that guy?

33:33.979 --> 33:36.514
I think I need a lawyer.

33:36.516 --> 33:39.617
Yes, perhaps it is
time to see a lawyer.

33:39.619 --> 33:42.537
On the other hand,
maybe it's time to...

33:42.539 --> 33:44.539
♪ Stand up, Johnny ♪

33:44.541 --> 33:48.376
♪ Be a man... ♪

33:48.378 --> 33:50.245
(laughs)

33:50.247 --> 33:54.499
♪ Don't run from the truth,
even if you can. ♪

33:54.501 --> 33:56.351
(laughs)
Thank you so much.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.388
You know my song.

34:00.390 --> 34:02.390
Yes.

34:02.392 --> 34:05.860
The question is... do you?

34:10.483 --> 34:13.067
Hey, you guys,
you missed it.

34:13.069 --> 34:14.886
It was classic, beautiful.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.888
Ducky is an artist.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.556
Did you learn what
Sergeant Hill was selling?

34:18.558 --> 34:20.408
Yeah. Not quite what
we were thinking.

34:20.409 --> 34:22.527
That mean he wasn't running
a WMD smuggling ring?

34:22.529 --> 34:25.612
No WMDs, no gunrunning.

34:26.248 --> 34:28.032
He was selling Moon rocks.

34:28.034 --> 34:29.784
Moon rocks?

34:29.786 --> 34:31.002
What do you mean?
Like... like

34:31.004 --> 34:32.504
rocks from the Moon?

34:32.505 --> 34:33.621
People buy those?

34:33.623 --> 34:35.507
Apparently rock stars do.

34:35.509 --> 34:36.958
And collectors.
Are you kidding me?

34:36.960 --> 34:39.377
Moon rocks are worth ten times
their weight in diamonds.

34:39.379 --> 34:40.745
I told you
he was gonna love this.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.130
But it's illegal
to own a Moon rock.

34:42.132 --> 34:44.299
I mean, you can't buy 'em.
When did he get his?

34:44.301 --> 34:45.300
About 12 years ago.

34:45.302 --> 34:47.969
He said it was stolen
from a museum.

34:47.971 --> 34:49.521
I think I know
what he's talking about.

34:49.523 --> 34:51.940
After <i>Apollo</i> <i>17,</i>
NASA distributed

34:51.942 --> 34:54.025
Moon rocks to every
country in the world.

34:54.027 --> 34:55.310
A few others
to museums.

34:55.312 --> 34:56.527
About 12 years ago,

34:56.530 --> 34:57.729
there was
a high-profile break-in

34:57.731 --> 34:59.781
at The Naval Museum
of North Carolina.

34:59.783 --> 35:01.399
Their Moon rock was stolen.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.767
Sergeant Hill.
Had to be him.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.319
Then he sold the rock
to Del Finney.

35:04.321 --> 35:06.070
No, he couldn't have.
Why?

35:06.072 --> 35:07.322
Because NASA investigators

35:07.324 --> 35:09.290
quietly recovered the rock
two years later from a janitor.

35:09.292 --> 35:10.742
And I only
know this because

35:10.744 --> 35:13.110
I was at a <i>Star Trek</i> convention
in 2002, and I met...

35:13.112 --> 35:14.495
Okay, McGee, I got it.

35:14.497 --> 35:17.332
So if the real Moon rock
was returned to the museum...

35:17.334 --> 35:19.217
What did Del Finney buy?

35:19.219 --> 35:21.302
A knockoff.

35:21.304 --> 35:22.620
(elevator bell dings)

35:22.622 --> 35:24.839
Our one-hit-wonder
bought a knockoff.

35:24.841 --> 35:28.059
His Moon rock is made
out of JSC-1.

35:28.061 --> 35:30.812
NASA's artificial lunar dirt.

35:30.814 --> 35:33.014
Yeah, the chemical structure
is unmistakable.

35:33.016 --> 35:35.800
Very clever.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.734
Duck?

35:36.736 --> 35:38.469
It's a con.

35:38.471 --> 35:39.237
Duck?

35:39.239 --> 35:40.304
Sergeant Hill was

35:40.306 --> 35:42.106
running a con.
He took advantage

35:42.108 --> 35:44.492
of the high-profile
Moon rock theft

35:44.494 --> 35:47.195
to sell knockoffs.

35:47.197 --> 35:49.414
Del Finney,
Commander Roberts

35:49.416 --> 35:51.332
and others all thought

35:51.334 --> 35:54.318
they were buying
stolen Moon rock. Wait.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.371
Did we just solve the case?

35:56.373 --> 35:57.505
No.

35:57.507 --> 35:59.757
Oh. No, our con man,
Sergeant Hill--

35:59.759 --> 36:02.510
we still don't know
why he was killed.

36:02.512 --> 36:05.880
Well, my vote is,
disgruntled buyer.

36:05.882 --> 36:08.332
If I had bought a Moon rock
for a hundred grand,

36:08.334 --> 36:10.768
and then I found out
it was just some punk rock,

36:10.770 --> 36:12.336
I would be totally ticked.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.606
But Del Finney thought
he was getting the real McCoy.

36:14.608 --> 36:16.608
And before he
handed over the cash,

36:16.610 --> 36:19.176
Hill gave him a sample
to send to a lab.

36:19.178 --> 36:22.897
He was told to
say that he...

36:22.899 --> 36:25.366
found the rock
while hiking,

36:25.368 --> 36:28.236
and thought it might be
a common lunar meteorite,

36:28.238 --> 36:29.821
and he wanted
to verify it.

36:29.823 --> 36:30.822
What lab?

36:30.824 --> 36:31.789
NASA.

36:31.791 --> 36:33.691
Okay, there is no way

36:33.693 --> 36:36.911
that anyone at NASA mistook
that knockoff

36:36.913 --> 36:38.913
for a lunar meteorite.

36:38.915 --> 36:41.132
Hmm.

36:41.134 --> 36:42.884
Who was running the lab
12 years ago?

36:48.257 --> 36:51.042
BLACKWELL: Next time, I'm gonna
play you blindfolded.

36:51.044 --> 36:53.711
I'd like to see you win
every once in a while.

36:53.713 --> 36:56.380
(laughs, sniffles, coughs)

36:56.382 --> 37:00.217
Agent DiNozzo...
and, uh...?

37:00.219 --> 37:01.602
Special Agent Gibbs.

37:01.604 --> 37:03.287
I've heard a lot
about you.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.440
(coughs)

37:07.026 --> 37:08.660
(sighs)

37:11.163 --> 37:12.914
TONY:
Did you Keyser Soze us?

37:12.916 --> 37:14.999
Can't believe I fell for that.

37:15.001 --> 37:17.168
I'm gonna keep this Hubble pen.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.872
You know this guy?

37:23.075 --> 37:25.343
I already told your agents
I didn't.

37:25.345 --> 37:26.794
TONY:
I remember.

37:26.796 --> 37:28.379
The funny thing is,
when we looked

37:28.381 --> 37:31.215
into the NASA rock verification
lab that you used to run,

37:31.217 --> 37:33.751
this guy Hill was doing
protective services

37:33.753 --> 37:35.386
in the building.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.523
Are you sure
you two have never met?

37:39.358 --> 37:41.592
You know what?

37:41.594 --> 37:44.779
I'm not gonna say another word
until I talk to my lawyer.

37:44.781 --> 37:45.947
(sniffles)

37:45.949 --> 37:47.648
DUCKY:
<i>Quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

37:47.650 --> 37:50.068
Case closed.

37:50.070 --> 37:51.285
(computer chirps)

37:51.287 --> 37:53.938
<i>La fin de l'affaire.</i>

37:53.940 --> 37:55.239
(laughter)

37:55.241 --> 37:56.457
Très bien, Ducky.

37:56.459 --> 37:58.659
Bravo, Ducky. You're a natural.
Ah.

37:58.661 --> 38:00.661
Well, I-I must admit that the...

38:00.663 --> 38:02.413
the role does appear to suit me,

38:02.415 --> 38:04.298
but I can't...
I can't help thinking

38:04.300 --> 38:06.334
that there's something
I'm forgetting.

38:06.336 --> 38:08.452
It has not
forgotten you.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.638
Remember
the promise you made.

38:16.812 --> 38:19.296
Thank you.

38:23.235 --> 38:26.470
You are profoundly welcome.

38:31.293 --> 38:32.476
Hey, Duck,
fun's over.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.579
Need to get you out
of the bullpen now. Go.

38:34.581 --> 38:36.164
Now? I thought I might
assist with the paperwork.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.116
No. McGee can take
care of that.

38:38.118 --> 38:39.534
Only place you're
going is Autopsy.

38:39.536 --> 38:42.153
Back to...?
You're cleared for duty, Duck.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.921
Oh.

38:43.923 --> 38:45.373
(laughing):
Oh.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.658
How wonder... ful.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.214
(sighs)

38:53.216 --> 38:54.932
Back to, uh...

38:54.934 --> 38:57.718
Okay.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.353
Oh, I suppose, uh,

38:59.355 --> 39:02.890
I'll just be going
back to Autopsy.

39:07.613 --> 39:10.148
(Ziva chuckles quietly)

39:10.150 --> 39:12.366
We are finally
whole again.

39:16.572 --> 39:18.773
(doors whoosh open)

39:21.710 --> 39:24.412
(whooshing)

39:28.200 --> 39:31.385
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:31.387 --> 39:34.088
I know that you're in a
time crunch, I do, yeah.

39:34.090 --> 39:35.756
But you know what?
<i>I</i> have reports

39:35.758 --> 39:37.225
to write, as
well, and I have

39:37.227 --> 39:39.710
a misplaced liver
I can't seem to find,

39:39.712 --> 39:41.012
and to be quite honest,

39:41.014 --> 39:42.847
I haven't gone
to the bathroom yet today.

39:42.849 --> 39:44.182
I...

39:44.184 --> 39:46.400
Hello? Hello?!

39:46.402 --> 39:48.986
Hello.
Oh! Dr. Mallard.

39:48.988 --> 39:50.554
You scared the, uh...

39:50.556 --> 39:52.723
You-you... you scared me.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.275
I can see that.

39:54.277 --> 39:55.910
Can I help you?
No, but

39:55.912 --> 39:57.829
uh, maybe I can help you.

39:57.831 --> 40:00.198
I would love that,
but I'm sorry.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.833
Agent Gibbs said...

40:01.835 --> 40:03.918
I'm cleared for duty.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.002
Oh.

40:07.122 --> 40:08.956
Oh.

40:08.958 --> 40:11.459
(sighs)

40:11.461 --> 40:14.011
(sighs)

40:14.013 --> 40:15.296
Oh, thank God.

40:15.298 --> 40:16.747
(laughs)

40:16.749 --> 40:18.216
(laughing)

40:18.218 --> 40:20.885
Who, may I ask, is that?

40:20.887 --> 40:22.520
Who? Oh.

40:22.522 --> 40:24.588
Uh, the Kane County
coroner sent him over.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.390
He wants a second opinion
on a, uh...

40:26.392 --> 40:28.392
a subdural hematoma.

40:28.394 --> 40:32.096
It apparently happened
after a bar fight.

40:32.098 --> 40:33.397
They want all
their ducks in a row

40:33.399 --> 40:35.116
before they up the charges

40:35.118 --> 40:38.619
from involuntary manslaughter
to second-degree murder.

40:38.621 --> 40:40.738
How exciting.
I know.

40:40.740 --> 40:42.823
Isn't it?

40:46.044 --> 40:48.946
Well then,
have you checked to see

40:48.948 --> 40:51.215
whether this fellow
was on anticoagulants?

40:51.217 --> 40:54.385
If so, he could have sustained
a hematoma

40:54.387 --> 40:56.170
even with a minor injury.

40:56.172 --> 40:58.339
Good idea, Doctor.

41:02.177 --> 41:04.929
(high-pitched whirring)

41:09.818 --> 41:12.136
Hello.

41:12.138 --> 41:14.405
You wait here a moment

41:14.407 --> 41:16.640
while I change
into something more comfortable.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.276
Hmm?
