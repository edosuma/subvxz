01:39.214 --> 01:41.065
<i>The building has a gym,</i>

01:41.067 --> 01:43.359
a bike room, a party room,

01:43.361 --> 01:45.688
high-speed Internet and a rooftop pool.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.131
And if you're prepared to pay

01:47.133 --> 01:49.211
all cash, Dr. Bull, I think we can take

01:49.213 --> 01:52.327
this lovely home off the market today.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.990
I got to say,

01:53.997 --> 01:56.121
it's not at all what I had in mind.

01:56.123 --> 01:58.333
There are nine other people
bidding on this apartment.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.334
I know.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.202
I-I want to have, like,

02:01.204 --> 02:05.807
a open beam ceiling,
books everywhere, a dog,

02:05.809 --> 02:08.339
roaring blaze in the fireplace,

02:08.341 --> 02:10.078
maybe a pond.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.613
- A pond?
- Yeah.

02:11.615 --> 02:13.781
Dr. Bull, this is New York City.

02:13.783 --> 02:15.617
- We don't do ponds.
- Excuse me.

02:15.619 --> 02:16.751
Thoreau here.

02:16.753 --> 02:19.854
Hey. Where am I finding you,
Walden Pond?

02:19.856 --> 02:23.091
I'm just doing that senseless thing

02:23.093 --> 02:26.828
looking for an apartment.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.196
I thought you already had an apartment.

02:28.198 --> 02:29.464
I do,

02:29.466 --> 02:30.832
but it's cold and modern

02:30.834 --> 02:34.502
and looks like it belongs
to Bane from the Batman movies.

02:34.504 --> 02:36.037
Truth is,

02:36.039 --> 02:38.006
most nights I sleep in the office.

02:38.008 --> 02:39.607
But that's probably more
than you want to know.

02:39.609 --> 02:40.808
Way more.

02:40.810 --> 02:42.377
- What's up?
- Well, I was wondering

02:42.379 --> 02:44.444
if you felt like dinner.

02:44.446 --> 02:45.647
What were you thinking?

02:46.358 --> 02:48.735
Anywhere but Third Avenue.

02:50.279 --> 02:52.320
Scary, isn't it?

02:52.322 --> 02:54.055
You guys are three blocks away.

02:54.057 --> 02:55.990
Did you see it? Did you hear it?

02:55.992 --> 02:57.625
Building shook.

02:57.627 --> 02:59.788
But the phones kept ringing, and...

03:00.730 --> 03:02.624
work kept getting done.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.085
Like nothing happened.

03:06.136 --> 03:08.503
Kind of amazing what we've become.

03:10.307 --> 03:11.713
All right, dinner.

03:11.715 --> 03:14.042
But only because you're forcing me.

03:15.478 --> 03:17.812
Heptex Corporation,

03:17.814 --> 03:20.181
largest computer cloud service
in the world.

03:20.183 --> 03:23.117
The company's owner, Garrett Tilden,

03:23.119 --> 03:25.119
is my oldest client.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.488
Just after lunch today,
the FBI paid him a visit.

03:27.490 --> 03:29.442
They're starting to suspect

03:29.444 --> 03:31.349
the blast this morning
was the work of a group

03:31.351 --> 03:32.897
of eco-terrorists.

03:32.898 --> 03:35.599
The hotel ballroom they bombed
was hosting a symposium

03:35.601 --> 03:37.634
on how to maximize profits

03:37.636 --> 03:40.427
in a world of ecological deregulation.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.339
I missed the part where you explained

03:42.341 --> 03:44.207
what this has to do with me.

03:44.209 --> 03:47.010
Well, they presented
my client with a warrant

03:47.012 --> 03:49.646
seeking to seize any and all data files

03:49.648 --> 03:51.515
pertaining to the listed groups,

03:51.517 --> 03:53.917
all of whom are suspected
of trafficking in eco-terror.

03:53.919 --> 03:55.285
Okay.

03:55.287 --> 03:57.854
All of these groups
make use of Heptex clouds.

03:57.856 --> 04:00.424
Every website they visit,
every cell call they make,

04:00.426 --> 04:01.925
every text and e-mail they send

04:01.927 --> 04:03.827
is believed to have been recorded

04:03.829 --> 04:05.796
or catalogued on a Heptex server.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.065
How convenient.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.667
The FBI wants access to these servers.

04:10.669 --> 04:11.968
Of course they do.

04:11.970 --> 04:16.019
And for the moment,
my client is refusing to comply.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.207
<i>So here's the thing.</i>

04:17.209 --> 04:19.276
I've thought about it
for a whole 25 minutes,

04:19.278 --> 04:22.179
and I think your client's wrong.

04:22.181 --> 04:24.481
He ought to turn over those servers.

04:24.483 --> 04:27.517
Funny, I don't recall
asking for your opinion.

04:27.519 --> 04:30.629
I do recall you owing me three cases.

04:31.128 --> 04:33.000
You said you were scared on the phone.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.525
Don't you want them to catch these guys?

04:35.527 --> 04:36.927
Of course I do.

04:36.929 --> 04:38.562
But my client is worried.

04:38.564 --> 04:40.397
If the government can demand to see

04:40.399 --> 04:43.433
where people they think might be
bad guys have gone on the Web,

04:43.435 --> 04:45.268
what's to stop them
from demanding to see

04:45.270 --> 04:48.105
that same information about you or me?

04:49.189 --> 04:50.774
What's my name?

04:51.541 --> 04:52.943
- Bull.
- Right.

04:52.945 --> 04:54.277
Don't bull a Bull.

04:54.279 --> 04:55.929
Your client's trying to convince you

04:55.931 --> 04:57.481
that he's wrapping himself
up in the flag,

04:57.483 --> 04:59.783
when this is really about money.

04:59.785 --> 05:02.018
He's worried that
if he gives up those servers,

05:02.020 --> 05:05.055
people are gonna stop using his service.

05:05.057 --> 05:07.924
My advice?
Tell him to give up the servers.

05:07.926 --> 05:09.326
No one's ever gonna find out.

05:09.328 --> 05:10.794
FBI's not gonna say anything.

05:10.796 --> 05:12.395
It's not in their self-interest.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.598
And if he decides to kick up a fuss,

05:14.600 --> 05:16.566
it's gonna be all over the media.

05:16.568 --> 05:18.768
And half the country, the half like me

05:18.770 --> 05:20.804
that doesn't want to get blown up

05:20.806 --> 05:22.506
'cause they're in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

05:22.508 --> 05:24.708
they're gonna be very mad at him
for not sharing what he knows.

05:24.710 --> 05:26.409
Thanks for dinner.

05:27.646 --> 05:30.647
He's not my client anymore.

05:30.649 --> 05:32.449
He's ours.

05:32.451 --> 05:35.868
I'm entitled to three cases
worth of services from you

05:35.870 --> 05:37.654
and your company.

05:37.656 --> 05:39.689
And you don't get to pick the cases.

05:40.115 --> 05:41.458
So...

05:41.460 --> 05:42.859
leave your id at home,

05:42.861 --> 05:45.395
and meet me at my office
tomorrow morning at 9:00,

05:45.397 --> 05:47.956
and we can figure out how to proceed.

05:50.876 --> 05:52.302
I had a nice time at dinner, too,

05:52.304 --> 05:53.904
by the way.

05:53.906 --> 05:55.972
It's too late. You blew it.

05:55.974 --> 05:57.974
I'm not inviting you
back to the Batcave.

05:57.976 --> 05:59.176
9:00.

05:59.178 --> 06:01.444
Don't beg. It doesn't become you.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.650
That's not funny.

06:18.103 --> 06:19.863
Take that off.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.942
I never said I didn't want you to speak.

06:25.944 --> 06:27.911
Now, come on. They're
gonna be here any minute.

06:27.913 --> 06:29.546
Ms. Nunnelly,

06:29.548 --> 06:31.247
they're on their way in.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.251
Ooh, that's a tough one.

06:36.944 --> 06:39.923
Garrett Tilden, Harry Kemp,
this is Dr. Jason Bull,

06:39.925 --> 06:42.025
the gentleman I told
you about on the phone.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.259
Nice to meet you guys.

06:43.261 --> 06:44.627
You all right there?

06:44.629 --> 06:45.762
Yeah. It's nothing.

06:45.764 --> 06:47.597
It's a little rash I picked up.

06:47.599 --> 06:48.932
Some kind of Brazilian thing.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.433
Not contagious.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.904
Well, let's get
right to it, shall we?

06:56.274 --> 06:59.542
I had my staff watch
all the morning shows

06:59.544 --> 07:01.077
and check all the morning papers

07:01.079 --> 07:02.078
and their websites.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.513
No one is mentioning Heptex.

07:03.515 --> 07:04.981
Not yet.

07:04.983 --> 07:07.150
Of course, the FBI is still
hoping you'll play ball,

07:07.152 --> 07:09.018
and they can do this
without anyone knowing.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.088
But trust me, if you don't
surrender that data today,

07:12.090 --> 07:13.156
somebody is gonna

07:13.158 --> 07:14.858
leak that information,
and they are gonna

07:14.860 --> 07:18.094
use public opinion
to shame you into doing it.

07:18.797 --> 07:20.763
I already gave them the data.

07:20.765 --> 07:22.801
This morning, before we headed over.

07:24.636 --> 07:25.835
I'm confused.

07:25.837 --> 07:27.303
It's encrypted.

07:27.305 --> 07:29.939
They won't be able to read it,
not without an encryption key.

07:29.941 --> 07:31.040
It's a piece of code.

07:31.042 --> 07:33.176
Mr. Tilden and I are
the only ones who know it.

07:33.178 --> 07:34.144
I'm sorry.

07:34.146 --> 07:35.445
Harry is my number two.

07:35.447 --> 07:37.247
Most brilliant mind
I've ever encountered.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.282
Programming, business, all of it.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.569
Future of our company.

07:41.486 --> 07:45.688
You gave the United States
government encrypted data?

07:45.690 --> 07:47.557
We figured it would buy us some time,

07:47.559 --> 07:48.825
probably a day or so,

07:48.827 --> 07:51.628
so we could come over here
and come up with a game plan.

07:51.630 --> 07:52.762
Hey, I've got a plan.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.063
Give them the key.

07:54.065 --> 07:56.671
Excuse me. That's not the plan.

07:56.673 --> 07:58.902
That's not an option
we've even discussed.

07:58.904 --> 08:01.070
Well, it's either that
or we go to trial.

08:01.072 --> 08:02.772
And that would be your company

08:02.774 --> 08:04.507
versus the United States of America.

08:04.509 --> 08:07.177
And as big and powerful and brilliant

08:07.179 --> 08:08.545
as you are,

08:08.547 --> 08:11.147
the other guy is bigger and richer,

08:11.149 --> 08:13.616
and has many more resources.

08:14.477 --> 08:16.419
Here's how I look at it.

08:16.421 --> 08:19.022
The second the government
said they wanted our data,

08:19.024 --> 08:20.490
we were screwed.

08:20.492 --> 08:21.925
We sell security.

08:21.927 --> 08:24.961
We tell the public, we tell
the world to give us your data.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.421
We'll keep it safe and sound,

08:26.423 --> 08:27.870
and no one will ever see it.

08:27.872 --> 08:31.201
I comply with this warrant,
and I'm out of business.

08:31.203 --> 08:33.503
- But if I fight it...
- As long as we're in court,

08:33.505 --> 08:35.837
we'll be getting millions
of dollars of free publicity

08:35.840 --> 08:37.407
every day, reminding the world

08:37.409 --> 08:39.174
that we do not give up
their information.

08:39.177 --> 08:40.909
Not to the FBI.

08:40.912 --> 08:42.212
Not to anyone.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.482
Well, I guess we have
our marching orders, then.

08:49.906 --> 08:51.221
Publicity.

08:51.223 --> 08:54.591
You know, it's interesting;
On the news this morning,

08:54.593 --> 08:57.527
I heard "two dead, 11 injured."

08:57.529 --> 09:00.496
And it just... it seems...

09:00.498 --> 09:02.218
I mean, I understand
your point of view, but...

09:02.220 --> 09:03.800
I didn't set that bomb, Dr. Bull,

09:03.802 --> 09:04.968
and I have no idea who did.

09:04.970 --> 09:08.774
But I have 22,000 employees
all around the world

09:08.776 --> 09:10.647
who are dependent on me for a paycheck,

09:10.649 --> 09:12.609
and they've done nothing wrong.

09:12.611 --> 09:14.477
I've done nothing wrong.

09:14.479 --> 09:16.579
And I live in
the United States of America,

09:16.581 --> 09:18.548
a place where, if you do nothing wrong,

09:18.550 --> 09:19.649
you shouldn't be punished.

09:19.651 --> 09:21.618
Not to mention, you are guaranteed

09:21.620 --> 09:24.381
a right to personal privacy.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.589
Agreed.

09:26.591 --> 09:28.758
When J.P. told me you
were joining us this morning,

09:28.760 --> 09:30.193
I did my due diligence.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.196
I know who you are
and I know what you do.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.665
I'd like to have you
on the team, Dr. Bull,

09:35.667 --> 09:37.463
but if you don't want to be here...

09:37.465 --> 09:39.535
He wants to be here.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.366
Good. I'll let you know as soon as

09:41.368 --> 09:42.952
the government serves us
with a second warrant

09:42.954 --> 09:44.412
to provide an encryption key.

09:44.414 --> 09:46.152
Fantastic.

09:50.148 --> 09:52.181
Did I do something wrong?

09:54.653 --> 09:56.719
Speculation continues that the bomb,

09:56.721 --> 09:59.389
apparently a homemade explosive
of some sort,

09:59.391 --> 10:02.592
was set by a member
or members of what are called

10:02.594 --> 10:03.926
eco-terror groups,

10:03.928 --> 10:06.029
though no group has yet
claimed responsibility.

10:06.031 --> 10:09.332
Frightening. Really frightening.

10:09.334 --> 10:11.778
I must have eaten at that hotel
five, six times, maybe.

10:11.780 --> 10:13.503
I walk by it every time I go to work.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.305
Hey. Good news, team.

10:15.307 --> 10:16.906
We have just been hired

10:16.908 --> 10:19.242
by one of the biggest companies
in the world.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.411
Heptex Corporation wants us

10:21.413 --> 10:24.147
to help them defend their liberty.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.551
Their liberty?

10:28.553 --> 10:31.054
Who's threatening their liberty?

10:31.056 --> 10:33.156
Well, it's a pesky
little outfit called the FBI.

10:33.158 --> 10:35.291
They seem to think
that Heptex may have information

10:35.293 --> 10:37.226
that will help them
figure out who's responsible

10:37.228 --> 10:39.462
for that bombing at the hotel yesterday.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.050
Call me crazy, but I sense
some discord in the room.

10:49.052 --> 10:51.674
Well, and I'm only speaking for myself,

10:51.676 --> 10:54.644
but it feels like perhaps
we belong on the other side

10:54.646 --> 10:56.512
of this particular conflict.

10:56.514 --> 10:57.947
Does it?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.284
We're professionals...

11:01.286 --> 11:03.820
professionals for hire...
and we don't always get

11:03.822 --> 11:05.788
to choose who hires us.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.523
Or what side we're on.

11:07.525 --> 11:10.104
But everyone deserves
a vigorous defense.

11:10.106 --> 11:11.724
We know that.

11:11.726 --> 11:14.364
But usually... at least
since I've known you...

11:14.366 --> 11:16.132
you've always seemed...

11:16.134 --> 11:17.900
particular about the kind of cases

11:17.902 --> 11:19.836
that you've gotten involved with.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.773
You're assuming you know
my point of view on this.

11:23.775 --> 11:25.508
This is about the right to privacy.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.777
Aren't Americans entitled to that?

11:27.779 --> 11:30.215
Aren't corporations
that abide by the law

11:30.217 --> 11:31.547
entitled to that?

11:31.549 --> 11:33.516
Of course they are, Bull.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.853
It's just...
this happened a block from us.

11:36.855 --> 11:38.955
Everyone's just a little... raw,

11:38.957 --> 11:40.934
a little tender from this whole thing.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.770
All right.

11:44.562 --> 11:46.329
Understood.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.865
Now... let's put together
some mock juries.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.167
I want some privacy advocates,
and I want some people

11:51.169 --> 11:53.002
who believe that rights are something

11:53.004 --> 11:55.438
that can be given up
if it is for the greater good.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.639
You got it.

11:56.641 --> 11:59.208
Okay. I'll work on
some speculative arguments

11:59.210 --> 12:01.077
- for counsel to consider.
- Excellent.

12:01.079 --> 12:02.612
- Danny.
- Yeah?

12:02.614 --> 12:04.313
I've got two names for you.

12:04.315 --> 12:04.783
Okay.

12:04.785 --> 12:08.184
Gary Tilden and Harry Kemp.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.954
Tilden is founder and CEO of Heptex.

12:11.956 --> 12:14.023
And Kemp is his right hand.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.526
Our clients. You want me
to investigate our clients?

12:17.053 --> 12:18.461
Well, I didn't pick them.

12:18.463 --> 12:19.896
They didn't pick me.

12:19.898 --> 12:22.331
Sort of a shotgun marriage
arranged by lead counsel.

12:22.333 --> 12:25.435
And who is lead counsel?

12:27.772 --> 12:30.106
That would be...

12:30.108 --> 12:31.674
J.P. Nunnelly.

12:31.676 --> 12:33.576
J.P. Nunnelly?

12:37.198 --> 12:38.247
What?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.183
I didn't say anything.

12:40.869 --> 12:42.585
Lead counsel on this case

12:42.587 --> 12:44.954
is J.P. Nunnelly.

12:44.956 --> 12:46.222
- What a surprise.
- She's great.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.256
We love her.

12:47.258 --> 12:48.524
- Saved my ass.
- Yeah.

12:57.869 --> 13:00.169
What do you know about encryption,

13:00.171 --> 13:01.804
encryption keys?

13:01.806 --> 13:03.246
Everything.

13:03.248 --> 13:04.493
Don't be so modest.

13:04.495 --> 13:06.615
It sort of has to do
with the level of encryption

13:06.617 --> 13:08.454
and the volume of the data
that's been encrypted.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.146
But here's the bottom line:

13:10.148 --> 13:13.449
No matter how complex the encryption,

13:13.451 --> 13:15.618
no matter how voluminous the data,

13:15.620 --> 13:18.554
there's always someone, somewhere,

13:18.556 --> 13:21.824
who, given the necessary amount of time

13:21.826 --> 13:24.927
and proper skill set, can break through.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.662
And would you know where to find

13:26.664 --> 13:28.664
any of the people who can do that?

13:28.666 --> 13:29.959
I might.

13:30.401 --> 13:32.268
I'm guessing this is for Heptex?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.503
Well...

13:34.756 --> 13:36.172
Well, then I can't.

13:36.799 --> 13:38.076
Excuse me?

13:38.078 --> 13:40.343
A guy in my building
got caught in that blast.

13:40.345 --> 13:41.711
Burned his face.

13:41.713 --> 13:43.446
He's in the hospital now.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.616
I'm sorry, Cable.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.017
Were you close?

13:48.853 --> 13:50.820
He lived in my building.

13:52.845 --> 13:54.657
So you won't do this?

13:57.262 --> 13:58.928
Not for them.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.897
Well, it wouldn't be for them;
They have keys.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.098
It would be for me,

14:02.100 --> 14:03.766
assuming that I can get access

14:03.768 --> 14:06.435
to the relevant data
on the relevant servers,

14:06.437 --> 14:08.738
which is also
why I would need your help.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.146
Sounds like you don't
trust your clients.

14:10.148 --> 14:12.108
I don't know my clients, not yet.

14:14.078 --> 14:15.545
Will you help me with this?

14:15.547 --> 14:18.981
I'm sorry, Dr. Bull, I can't.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.883
Really? Why not?

14:20.885 --> 14:24.820
Actually, I'm not feeling very well.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.356
Cable!

14:27.358 --> 14:29.058
Aren't you a little concerned

14:29.060 --> 14:31.427
you won't have a job when you come back?

14:43.364 --> 14:45.697
Wow. Very cool.

14:45.699 --> 14:50.120
So, all those people are
gonna listen to my arguments?

14:50.122 --> 14:51.803
That is the idea.

14:51.805 --> 14:53.205
You get to audition your case,

14:53.207 --> 14:56.308
and we get reactions from the mock jury.

14:56.310 --> 14:58.704
Biometrics in real time,

14:58.706 --> 15:01.380
individual and focus group interviews.

15:01.905 --> 15:03.782
You're a really smart man, Mr. Bull.

15:03.784 --> 15:06.652
Can you say that again, slower?

15:06.654 --> 15:08.887
I'm having trouble following you.

15:08.889 --> 15:11.323
You're also very funny.

15:11.325 --> 15:13.258
Well, it's part of the service.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.993
Another thing we like to do at TAC

15:14.995 --> 15:17.663
<i>is we find out everything we can</i>

15:17.665 --> 15:19.464
about the other side.

15:19.466 --> 15:21.266
Well... yeah.

15:21.946 --> 15:24.336
Good. I'm glad
we see eye to eye on that.

15:24.338 --> 15:26.071
That is why I think

15:26.073 --> 15:29.107
you should ask your client
to give us a copy of the server

15:29.109 --> 15:30.776
he surrendered to the FBI.

15:30.778 --> 15:33.596
The encrypted one, that no one can read?

15:33.598 --> 15:34.660
That'd be the one.

15:34.662 --> 15:35.747
And now that we're all on the same team,

15:35.749 --> 15:36.982
maybe they can give us a key.

15:38.352 --> 15:39.885
Why?

15:39.887 --> 15:41.720
Why do we need the server?

15:41.722 --> 15:44.856
So that we can know
as much as the other guys,

15:44.858 --> 15:46.391
and maybe more.

15:48.829 --> 15:50.562
Again, it's encrypted.

15:50.564 --> 15:52.794
The FBI doesn't have the key.

15:52.796 --> 15:54.366
My client won't give them the key,

15:54.368 --> 15:56.234
which is why we're going to court.

15:56.236 --> 15:57.803
Again, it's the FBI.

15:57.805 --> 16:00.939
And trust me, they are going
to crack that thing open.

16:00.941 --> 16:03.008
And when they do,
they're not gonna send us

16:03.010 --> 16:05.477
a sweet little e-mail
to tell us about it.

16:07.381 --> 16:09.414
Why do you really want it?

16:09.744 --> 16:11.850
Don't you trust
the people we're working for?

16:12.455 --> 16:13.485
Do you?

16:13.873 --> 16:15.353
Why are you afraid

16:15.355 --> 16:16.355
to ask them for it?

16:17.168 --> 16:18.590
Anything you discover

16:18.592 --> 16:21.031
is protected under
attorney-client privilege.

16:21.033 --> 16:23.395
Are you afraid of
what you're going to discover?

16:23.397 --> 16:25.664
I like to know who I'm working for.

16:25.666 --> 16:27.866
Well, I know who you're working for.

16:27.868 --> 16:29.735
You're working for me.

16:30.181 --> 16:33.138
And here's what you need
to know: I like to win.

16:33.140 --> 16:36.408
And I don't sense you're
helping me to do that right now.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.943
Well, finding out what's really

16:37.945 --> 16:40.378
going on here isn't gonna
stop you from winning.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.848
What are you talking about,
"what's really going on here"?

16:42.850 --> 16:45.851
The government is overreaching.

16:45.853 --> 16:48.920
We have a right to privacy;
It's in the Constitution, Bull.

16:48.922 --> 16:50.756
There's nothing
in the Constitution that says

16:50.758 --> 16:52.724
if you know who killed someone,

16:52.726 --> 16:55.260
you have a right
to keep that to yourself.

17:02.069 --> 17:04.402
I hate it when Mom and Dad fight.

17:05.049 --> 17:05.904
<i>Really?</i>

17:05.906 --> 17:07.239
That's what you think this is about?

17:07.241 --> 17:09.307
Some higher principle
that puts your client

17:09.309 --> 17:10.541
above the greater good?

17:10.544 --> 17:12.477
Well, I'm sorry, neither of those guys

17:12.479 --> 17:14.546
reminds me of Thomas Jefferson.

17:14.548 --> 17:17.949
Really? And who appointed you
to the court, Mr. Bull?

17:17.951 --> 17:20.270
And just so we're clear,
I actually do believe

17:20.271 --> 17:22.343
that this is an idea worth fighting for.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.455
And I'm not saying that they
don't have some other reason

17:24.458 --> 17:27.404
for doing what they're doing,
but that's not my problem.

17:27.406 --> 17:29.828
There is a point of law to argue here,

17:29.830 --> 17:31.463
and I have been hired to argue it.

17:31.465 --> 17:33.431
And I don't need to look
at those servers

17:33.433 --> 17:35.353
to know whether or not
I'm doing the right thing!

17:36.203 --> 17:39.571
We are... ready downstairs.

17:39.573 --> 17:41.573
Thank you, Benny.

18:38.165 --> 18:39.564
Good evening, young lady.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.166
What can I do for you?

18:41.168 --> 18:43.735
Well, my boss just called me,
woke me up,

18:43.737 --> 18:46.571
said he needed a flash drive for
this meeting that he's having.

18:46.573 --> 18:48.840
Um, I was gonna run it up to him.

18:48.842 --> 18:50.208
You have I.D.?

18:50.210 --> 18:51.977
Yeah. One sec.

18:56.357 --> 18:57.582
And your boss's name?

18:57.584 --> 18:59.184
Harry Kemp.

18:59.186 --> 19:01.653
What do you know. He signed
in two minutes before you did.

19:01.655 --> 19:03.488
You know where you're going?

19:03.490 --> 19:05.423
Actually, I don't.

19:05.425 --> 19:07.959
5211, 52nd floor.

19:07.961 --> 19:09.661
Elevator's on your right.

19:09.663 --> 19:10.929
5211.

19:36.535 --> 19:38.736
The Foresight Foundry?

19:49.469 --> 19:51.736
Benjamin?

19:56.209 --> 19:57.943
Nice office.

19:57.945 --> 19:59.411
It's all about the views.

19:59.413 --> 20:01.613
How are things at Homeland Security?

20:01.615 --> 20:03.548
You're alive, right?

20:04.895 --> 20:06.318
Keep up the good work.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.986
What can I do for you, Benjamin?

20:07.988 --> 20:09.921
It's about the Midtown Hotel bombing.

20:09.923 --> 20:11.589
I need a favor.

20:13.327 --> 20:15.727
I need a copy of the Heptex server.

20:19.744 --> 20:21.032
No problem.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.734
What else you want?

20:22.736 --> 20:24.536
Osama bin Laden's pillbox?

20:24.538 --> 20:26.842
John Wilkes Booth's gun?
Just name it, Benny,

20:26.844 --> 20:28.373
I'll put it in your shopping cart.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.008
You know how long
it took me to get out here?

20:30.010 --> 20:31.076
I need it.

20:31.078 --> 20:33.678
And your buddies in Justice,
they owe me.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.313
They messed me around really good

20:35.315 --> 20:36.982
with that Hayden Watkins case.

20:36.984 --> 20:40.018
You know it's a paperweight, right?

20:40.020 --> 20:43.455
Nobody can crack the thing...
we're talking deep encryption.

20:43.457 --> 20:45.256
Then you've got nothing to lose.

20:45.258 --> 20:46.520
Benny...

20:47.461 --> 20:49.440
do yourself a favor.

20:49.896 --> 20:52.097
Call the U.S. Attorney's Office.

20:52.099 --> 20:54.499
They're required to provide you
with all the evidence.

20:54.501 --> 20:56.067
Which they will.

20:56.069 --> 20:58.737
Just... not in time
for us to decrypt it.

20:58.739 --> 21:00.972
And what makes you think
you can decrypt it?

21:03.610 --> 21:06.211
Got no other way to think.

21:16.634 --> 21:18.884
See? Dreams do come true.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.652
<i>I didn't expect</i>

21:20.654 --> 21:22.621
to see you until I got to court.

21:22.623 --> 21:24.053
And maybe not even then.

21:24.055 --> 21:26.091
Hey, it's voir dire day.

21:26.093 --> 21:27.993
I'm not gonna miss voir dire day.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.928
Maybe you haven't heard, but I'm the guy

21:29.930 --> 21:33.532
who actually put the "voir"
in voir dire day.

21:35.035 --> 21:36.612
Hold your applause.

21:37.603 --> 21:40.871
Plus, we never get a chance
to compare jury strategies.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.676
This doesn't work for me.

21:45.713 --> 21:47.998
I need to know whose team you're on.

21:48.677 --> 21:51.183
I'm on... your team, obviously.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.684
There is no other team.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.619
But part of being on your team

21:54.621 --> 21:57.322
is me telling you
what I think, which I did,

21:57.324 --> 22:01.262
maybe a little too passionately,
for which I apologize.

22:06.467 --> 22:09.167
Well, obviously, I think
the key is to find people

22:09.169 --> 22:10.736
who are sympathetic to the idea

22:10.738 --> 22:12.504
that our right to privacy
isn't something

22:12.506 --> 22:14.586
that can be traded away
when it suits the government.

22:15.650 --> 22:18.643
Yeah, that's one approach.

22:18.645 --> 22:21.046
But it's better when you can lay
off all that government stuff

22:21.048 --> 22:22.808
and just make it personal.

22:22.810 --> 22:25.283
What's more personal
than the Constitution?

22:25.285 --> 22:26.985
Than our Bill of Rights?

22:26.987 --> 22:29.790
Your browser history, for one.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.824
We all have secrets, J.P.

22:32.826 --> 22:36.161
And because we conduct
so much of our personal

22:36.163 --> 22:39.097
and business lives
on phones and computers,

22:39.099 --> 22:40.665
those secrets don't go away.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.034
They're parked
all over the world on servers,

22:43.036 --> 22:45.103
just like the ones your client owns.

22:45.105 --> 22:47.595
So, I think the key is
to find people who

22:47.597 --> 22:49.627
understand that.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.411
Who understand
this is a personal threat.

22:54.298 --> 22:57.949
Pool equipment salesman.

22:57.951 --> 22:59.818
38 years old.

22:59.820 --> 23:01.253
My deep dive on the Web

23:01.255 --> 23:03.855
indicates he has nothing
in his bank account.

23:03.857 --> 23:06.250
His mortgage is seriously underwater.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.693
He's wearing
an expensive wristwatch,

23:08.695 --> 23:11.329
and has a ring full of bling.

23:11.331 --> 23:14.099
Certainly wants to project
the appearance of success.

23:14.101 --> 23:17.202
That is a man who values his secrets.

23:17.204 --> 23:18.468
Our kind of guy.

23:18.470 --> 23:23.542
Potential juror number 11 is
a 32-year-old graphics designer.

23:23.544 --> 23:25.911
And speaking of "graphic,"
he happens to subscribe

23:25.913 --> 23:27.979
to three different
pornographic websites.

23:27.981 --> 23:31.283
Three? But so much of it is free.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.617
I'm told.

23:33.988 --> 23:39.057
Hands up. How many of you have
watched adult entertainment?

23:40.227 --> 23:41.860
How many of you

23:41.862 --> 23:43.628
subscribe... that is, pay money...

23:43.630 --> 23:46.498
to have access to an adult website?

23:49.902 --> 23:52.436
That's the man I want on my jury.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.480
Chunk, you scared me.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.914
What are you doing in here?

24:02.916 --> 24:04.149
I'm looking for a jacket.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.684
I've been trailing that guy Harry Kemp

24:05.686 --> 24:07.355
for the last two nights
in the same coat,

24:07.357 --> 24:08.666
and I need something new.

24:09.562 --> 24:10.728
Nice.

24:10.744 --> 24:11.943
I want this back.

24:11.945 --> 24:13.328
Make no promises.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.246
It's weird, you know.

24:15.248 --> 24:16.514
Every night around midnight,

24:16.516 --> 24:18.916
he ends up in the same office
on Sixth Avenue.

24:18.918 --> 24:20.918
It's a place called
The Foresight Foundry.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.854
There's nothing about them
on the Internet.

24:22.856 --> 24:25.590
They have cameras out front
and a handprint reader,

24:25.592 --> 24:28.226
so it's not like I can
just walk inside, you know?

24:28.228 --> 24:29.294
Sounds serious.

24:29.296 --> 24:31.095
You know those little transmitters

24:31.097 --> 24:34.232
that you stick on Bull in
court so Marissa can hear him?

24:37.537 --> 24:38.536
Bingo.

24:38.538 --> 24:40.138
I want my coat back.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.839
I make no promises.

24:46.946 --> 24:48.646
Thanks for dinner.

24:48.648 --> 24:52.283
Well, I think we did
all we could jury wise.

24:53.858 --> 24:55.553
So what turned you around?

24:55.983 --> 24:57.955
I mean, last night, you
were convinced we were

24:57.957 --> 24:59.557
harboring killers,

24:59.559 --> 25:02.226
and today, you're helping me
find just the right jurors

25:02.228 --> 25:05.296
with the deepest, darkest secrets.

25:05.848 --> 25:08.132
Seems a little schizophrenic,
wouldn't you say?

25:08.134 --> 25:09.801
You hired me to do a job.

25:09.803 --> 25:13.538
I realized... I had an obligation...

25:13.540 --> 25:18.445
to you, your client and myself.

25:18.447 --> 25:21.104
Nice summation, Counselor.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.009
I'm not sure I completely believe it.

25:24.011 --> 25:26.751
But I appreciate the
effort it must have taken

25:26.753 --> 25:29.987
to put your boots on
and shovel all that over my way.

25:34.461 --> 25:37.161
See you in the morning, Bull.

25:50.777 --> 25:52.337
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

25:52.950 --> 25:54.011
Are you okay?

25:54.013 --> 25:55.146
- Yeah. I just...
- I'm sorry.

25:55.148 --> 25:56.614
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

25:56.616 --> 25:57.815
My hands aren't on you.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.817
God, watch where you're going.

25:59.819 --> 26:01.953
I'm sorry.

26:08.928 --> 26:11.662
Taxi? Taxi?

26:20.039 --> 26:22.140
Isn't it past your TV time?

26:22.142 --> 26:23.641
Shouldn't you be asleep,

26:23.643 --> 26:26.477
so you can have a productive day
at school tomorrow?

26:27.947 --> 26:30.782
Is this even something someone
your age should be watching?

26:33.086 --> 26:34.643
What is this?

26:35.321 --> 26:36.687
What's that?

26:37.692 --> 26:39.490
Goodness.

26:39.492 --> 26:40.992
Is it...?

26:40.994 --> 26:42.927
But how?

26:42.929 --> 26:45.663
You don't want to know, but
you might want to thank Benny.

26:45.665 --> 26:48.032
And it's unencrypted?

26:48.034 --> 26:50.935
Looks that way.
The parts we needed anyway.

26:50.937 --> 26:52.437
You were able to do that?

26:52.439 --> 26:54.605
- Nope.
- Cable?

26:55.952 --> 26:58.609
Not her personally,
but she made it happen.

26:58.611 --> 27:00.578
And who made her happen?

27:04.317 --> 27:05.858
Thank you.

27:06.619 --> 27:10.421
You didn't happen to apologize
to her for me, did you?

27:11.957 --> 27:14.158
Good, 'cause I wanted
to do that myself.

27:18.231 --> 27:19.597
Did you find anything?

27:19.599 --> 27:20.898
Nope, not yet.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.333
Can I help?

27:22.335 --> 27:24.001
You have court in the morning.

27:24.003 --> 27:25.703
Well, so do you, kind of.

27:25.705 --> 27:26.838
Go to bed, Bull.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.873
It'll go so much faster
without you here.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.414
Thank you.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.349
Honestly.

27:39.193 --> 27:40.193
Thank you.

27:41.624 --> 27:43.154
Are you still up?

27:44.039 --> 27:46.123
I'm going.

28:04.244 --> 28:06.445
Peace offering.

28:09.516 --> 28:12.250
Thank you for agreeing to see me

28:12.252 --> 28:14.107
so early in the morning.

28:16.256 --> 28:17.979
I owe you an apology.

28:20.194 --> 28:21.760
I'm a psychologist by trade,

28:21.762 --> 28:25.163
which implies that I know
something about human behavior.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.700
Which makes it all the more embarrassing

28:28.702 --> 28:30.787
when I have no control over my own.

28:34.908 --> 28:36.379
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

28:38.812 --> 28:40.946
I'm sorry I threatened your job.

28:43.083 --> 28:46.017
And I appreciate what you did
to help me and Marissa,

28:46.019 --> 28:48.286
even though I know
it went against your principles.

28:48.288 --> 28:51.790
It wasn't me. I got help from
this hacker group I belong to.

28:51.792 --> 28:55.026
Mostly, this guy
in Frankfurt... EIKabong.

28:55.028 --> 28:57.129
At least I think he's a guy.

28:57.488 --> 29:01.433
Well, thank...
Mr. or Mrs. Kabong for me.

29:01.435 --> 29:05.604
And on reflection, I'm not totally sure

29:05.606 --> 29:08.940
my principles make all that much sense.

29:08.942 --> 29:12.995
I think... I was just upset.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.113
I was mad at Heptex

29:15.115 --> 29:17.415
'cause they wouldn't help
figure out who hurt my friend,

29:17.417 --> 29:21.219
and I was mad at you for helping Heptex.

29:22.744 --> 29:24.589
And then Marissa explained to me

29:24.591 --> 29:27.058
that you were mad at Heptex, too.

29:27.060 --> 29:28.160
You were frustrated.

29:28.162 --> 29:30.262
You wanted to get to the bottom of it,

29:30.264 --> 29:33.982
and the only way to do that was
to see what was on the server.

29:37.538 --> 29:39.337
She have any luck yet?

29:39.339 --> 29:41.315
Not the last time I checked.

29:43.843 --> 29:46.541
Would you like me to go to the office?

29:47.181 --> 29:50.015
Maybe take over
while she helps you out here?

29:51.347 --> 29:52.951
Yes, please.

29:59.259 --> 30:01.459
For what it's worth,

30:02.091 --> 30:03.528
I'm not actually sure

30:03.530 --> 30:05.810
we're right about
any of that stuff anyway.

30:08.535 --> 30:10.003
What do you mean?

30:11.063 --> 30:12.237
What are you talking about?

30:12.239 --> 30:15.106
I just think the world must have
been an easier place to navigate

30:15.108 --> 30:17.909
when everything we did,
every secret we have,

30:17.911 --> 30:20.512
everything we ever
looked up, wondered about,

30:20.514 --> 30:22.747
dreamed about, wasn't preserved online

30:22.749 --> 30:24.891
where someone else could find it.

30:26.580 --> 30:28.186
Where's this coming from?

30:29.363 --> 30:32.157
When Kabong cracked the server,

30:32.159 --> 30:34.971
I did a search, just to test it.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.651
I searched "Jason Bull."

30:39.566 --> 30:43.168
All this time,
listening to you talk about

30:43.170 --> 30:45.103
how little you think of lawyers,

30:45.105 --> 30:47.405
how that's the last
thing you want to do,

30:47.407 --> 30:50.275
how they're the lowest form of life.

30:50.747 --> 30:52.844
Well, some of that was for effect.

30:52.995 --> 30:56.615
Dr. Bull, in 2003,

30:56.617 --> 31:00.354
a "J. Bull" took the bar exam in Texas.

31:01.188 --> 31:02.810
And failed.

31:03.657 --> 31:05.203
Twice.

31:13.690 --> 31:15.171
Now you know.

31:16.843 --> 31:18.755
But I didn't need to.

31:19.940 --> 31:23.341
I just think that people
should be entitled to fail

31:23.343 --> 31:25.210
without the whole world knowing.

31:25.514 --> 31:28.146
That we shouldn't let the
bad guys hurt the good guys,

31:28.148 --> 31:29.381
but we also shouldn't

31:29.383 --> 31:32.043
penalize the good guys
if we can avoid it.

31:33.331 --> 31:36.388
You might be
onto something there, Cable.

31:38.025 --> 31:39.524
Thank you.

31:39.526 --> 31:40.905
Again.

31:41.946 --> 31:43.028
Okay.

31:47.267 --> 31:49.367
<i>Terrorists are out there,</i>

31:49.369 --> 31:51.094
and they want to hurt us.

31:51.972 --> 31:54.906
It's a grim reality of modern-day life.

31:56.476 --> 31:57.927
We've all seen it.

31:58.431 --> 31:59.764
Sadly,

31:59.913 --> 32:02.448
some of us have even experienced it.

32:02.983 --> 32:05.216
Terror is real.

32:05.719 --> 32:08.320
And our fear of it is justified.

32:08.322 --> 32:11.122
But our country is founded...

32:11.124 --> 32:13.591
You don't want to hear
how they're reacting, Bull.

32:13.593 --> 32:15.927
Yeah, I can see it.

32:15.929 --> 32:17.696
- It's bad.
- They're asleep, Bull.

32:17.698 --> 32:19.731
Actually, I'm kind of jealous.

32:19.733 --> 32:21.566
Nothing she's saying
is resonating with them.

32:21.568 --> 32:24.202
It's very hard to put the
genie back in the bottle.

32:28.508 --> 32:30.842
Rights are... something to be protected.

32:32.512 --> 32:35.313
And cherished, and...

32:35.315 --> 32:37.482
Your Honor, would you excuse me?

32:40.754 --> 32:42.287
Are you all right?

32:45.359 --> 32:47.525
Your Honor, can I take
a five-minute recess?

32:47.527 --> 32:50.962
<i>If you can cure that man in five
minutes, you can be my doctor.</i>

32:50.964 --> 32:52.330
Five-minute recess.

32:55.335 --> 32:57.403
Listen to me.

32:58.538 --> 32:59.830
I was wrong.

32:59.832 --> 33:01.897
You interrupted my summation to the jury

33:01.899 --> 33:03.372
to tell me you were
wrong about something?

33:03.374 --> 33:04.809
I interrupted your summation to the jury

33:04.811 --> 33:06.811
because it isn't working,
and the reason it isn't working

33:06.813 --> 33:08.380
is because I don't think
you believe it anymore.

33:08.382 --> 33:10.181
I think I convinced you

33:10.183 --> 33:12.164
that your thinking was faulty.

33:12.619 --> 33:14.552
But it wasn't.

33:14.554 --> 33:16.005
<i>My thinking...</i>

33:16.490 --> 33:17.956
my thinking was faulty.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.224
What are you talking about?

33:19.226 --> 33:20.759
I think the world must have been

33:20.761 --> 33:23.661
an easier place to navigate
when everything we did,

33:23.663 --> 33:25.063
every secret we had,

33:25.065 --> 33:26.798
everything we looked up, wondered about,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.299
dreamt about, try to accomplish,

33:28.301 --> 33:30.735
fail to accomplish,
give up on or succeed,

33:30.737 --> 33:32.804
wasn't stored forever in one place

33:32.806 --> 33:34.672
where someone, maybe even

33:34.674 --> 33:38.710
our government, can see it and judge it,

33:38.712 --> 33:43.314
and then use it against us
without our permission.

33:45.986 --> 33:48.354
'Cause you know what happens
in a country like that?

33:48.356 --> 33:50.756
People stop looking things up.

33:51.758 --> 33:54.477
People stop wondering.

33:55.228 --> 33:57.762
People stop dreaming.

33:58.277 --> 34:00.065
They don't fail.

34:00.067 --> 34:02.636
They just don't do anything.

34:02.803 --> 34:05.403
Because when their right to privacy

34:05.405 --> 34:07.138
is taken away,

34:07.140 --> 34:12.310
their ability to move forward,
to reinvent themselves,

34:12.312 --> 34:16.848
to imagine something better
is taken away, too.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.117
So, please,

34:19.119 --> 34:22.654
vote "not guilty" on
the government's motion

34:22.656 --> 34:25.388
to unlock my client's servers.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.764
We'll still find the bad guys.

34:29.685 --> 34:32.530
We've managed to do it
for a couple of hundred years

34:32.532 --> 34:35.533
without invading the privacy of others.

34:37.036 --> 34:39.370
And we've done it with liberty

34:39.741 --> 34:42.907
and justice for all.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.077
Thank you.

34:46.387 --> 34:47.344
Wow.

34:47.347 --> 34:49.848
What do you mean, "wow"?
What do the graphs say?

34:50.145 --> 34:52.449
G... I'm sorry, Bull.
I got so caught up

34:52.452 --> 34:54.686
in what she was saying,
I-I forgot to look.

35:00.327 --> 35:01.693
Mr. Foreman,

35:01.695 --> 35:03.461
- have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, Your Honor.

35:03.463 --> 35:06.831
<i>In the case of
The United States v. Heptex,</i>

35:06.833 --> 35:09.300
<i>Garrett Tilden and Harold Kemp,</i>

35:09.302 --> 35:12.003
on charges of violating Title 18...

35:12.005 --> 35:15.106
concealment of records
in a federal investigation...

35:15.108 --> 35:17.976
we find the defendants not guilty.

35:17.978 --> 35:20.147
Jury, thank you for your service.

35:20.149 --> 35:22.347
Court is adjourned.

35:37.464 --> 35:38.963
Congratulations, Chief.

35:38.965 --> 35:41.266
Thank you, Marissa. I couldn't
have done it without you.

35:41.268 --> 35:42.644
But I got a question for you:

35:43.103 --> 35:45.193
How's Cable doing with that server?

35:45.572 --> 35:46.804
She find anything yet?

35:46.806 --> 35:48.039
Not really.

35:48.041 --> 35:49.487
No major breakthroughs yet.

35:49.489 --> 35:52.410
Well, tell her to stop.
Tell her to forget it.

35:52.412 --> 35:53.545
Whatever you say.

35:53.547 --> 35:55.502
And Danny... she discover anything?

35:55.504 --> 35:57.549
Nothing she can make sense of yet.

35:57.551 --> 35:59.083
Tell her to stop as well.

35:59.085 --> 36:00.521
Case is closed.

36:01.188 --> 36:03.922
And you should go home
and get some sleep.

36:04.311 --> 36:06.175
Aye, aye, Captain.

36:06.726 --> 36:08.118
Night.

36:08.999 --> 36:12.230
No, no, no, no, you can't eat on
a momentous occasion like this

36:12.232 --> 36:14.232
and not wash it down with.

36:14.234 --> 36:17.268
Champagne Armand de Brignac Brut.

36:17.270 --> 36:18.670
I happen to have

36:18.672 --> 36:21.506
a bottle on these very premises.

36:30.650 --> 36:31.716
Hi.

36:31.718 --> 36:34.118
Bull. Hi, J.P.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.254
I don't get this.
What is everybody doing here?

36:36.256 --> 36:37.789
And why aren't you asleep, young lady?

36:37.791 --> 36:39.390
I know you told us to forget about it,

36:39.392 --> 36:41.226
but right after I got off
the phone with you,

36:41.228 --> 36:42.827
we made some real headway.

36:42.829 --> 36:44.996
Want to see what we've got?

36:46.933 --> 36:49.133
Is she talking about the server?

36:50.570 --> 36:53.104
That's the server you have
in there, isn't it?

36:57.410 --> 36:59.944
You know, I'm... I'm so sorry.

36:59.946 --> 37:02.046
Forget I said anything.

37:02.048 --> 37:03.948
Bull, I'm gonna... okay.

37:09.322 --> 37:10.521
You go ahead.

37:10.889 --> 37:12.257
Go in there.

37:13.393 --> 37:15.460
Do it. You know you want to.

37:17.631 --> 37:19.097
What about dinner?

37:19.546 --> 37:22.734
I'm gonna let you in
on a big secret, Mr. Bull.

37:24.604 --> 37:26.237
They serve dinner
every night of the week

37:26.239 --> 37:27.338
here in New York City.

37:32.746 --> 37:34.381
Thanks for your help today.

37:36.816 --> 37:40.351
Of course if you do find
anything interesting,

37:40.353 --> 37:42.412
I have been known to eat late.

37:46.903 --> 37:48.960
Thank you for agreeing
to meet us on such short notice.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.495
For you two, anything.

37:50.497 --> 37:55.166
Well, we've been trying to
puzzle a couple of things out.

37:55.168 --> 37:56.534
Couple of computer things,

37:56.536 --> 37:57.969
mathematical curiosities.

37:57.971 --> 38:00.038
And I remember you saying
that Mr. Kemp here

38:00.040 --> 38:02.006
was one of the smartest guys
you ever met.

38:02.008 --> 38:04.108
Anyway, an associate of mine

38:04.110 --> 38:05.677
has been working on this case.

38:05.679 --> 38:07.245
She's been following a suspect.

38:07.247 --> 38:09.447
And every night, around midnight,

38:09.449 --> 38:10.815
this suspect disappears

38:10.817 --> 38:13.818
into a high-security office
on Sixth Avenue

38:13.820 --> 38:16.254
called The Foresight Foundry.

38:16.256 --> 38:17.855
Long story short,

38:17.857 --> 38:21.526
she got this recording
of her suspect and someone

38:21.528 --> 38:23.394
on the inside.

38:23.396 --> 38:24.696
Now, we were wondering

38:24.698 --> 38:25.898
if you could make heads or tail of it,

38:25.900 --> 38:28.679
because the quality isn't great,
the voices are pretty rough,

38:28.681 --> 38:31.002
but you-you can make out
what they're saying.

38:32.205 --> 38:35.406
Ready? BA111.

38:35.408 --> 38:37.675
Um, 6:59 a.m.

38:39.189 --> 38:41.131
I'm gonna go with 3:22 p.m.

38:43.670 --> 38:45.450
7:14 p.m.

38:45.452 --> 38:46.517
Yeah.

38:46.519 --> 38:47.885
That's three.

38:47.887 --> 38:48.820
That's good.

38:48.822 --> 38:49.822
A million per?

38:50.453 --> 38:51.453
A million per.

38:53.154 --> 38:54.392
I have no idea.

38:55.295 --> 38:56.361
Me either.

38:56.363 --> 38:57.729
I know.

38:57.731 --> 38:59.964
It's really a puzzler, isn't it?

38:59.966 --> 39:03.401
Turns out, it is a form
of extreme gambling.

39:03.403 --> 39:06.571
Folks with major money who want to get

39:06.573 --> 39:10.041
a serious rush, they bet on
extraordinarily mundane things

39:10.043 --> 39:11.943
that they have no control over.

39:11.945 --> 39:13.144
Like the times

39:13.146 --> 39:16.681
major airlines actually
touch down at airports

39:16.683 --> 39:18.216
all over the world.

39:18.218 --> 39:19.317
That's what that was.

39:19.319 --> 39:20.418
"A million per."

39:20.420 --> 39:21.586
The man you just listened to

39:21.588 --> 39:24.389
bet $3 million in one night.

39:24.391 --> 39:25.649
And lost, by the way.

39:25.651 --> 39:28.693
Okay. So what does
any of this have to do with us?

39:28.695 --> 39:29.927
Well, I'm getting to that.

39:29.929 --> 39:32.764
So, these are the wire transfer receipts

39:32.766 --> 39:34.699
from a Swiss bank.

39:34.701 --> 39:38.870
Now, someone in your company
who was $65 million underwater

39:38.872 --> 39:41.973
received a wire transfer
immediately following

39:41.975 --> 39:46.010
the Midtown bombing for $100 million.

39:48.768 --> 39:50.635
Putting him $35 million up.

39:52.819 --> 39:57.280
J.P., I don't understand.

39:57.282 --> 39:59.257
The man who lost that money gambling

39:59.259 --> 40:01.959
and the man who got
$100 million wired to him

40:01.961 --> 40:04.729
within minutes of the blast
are the same man.

40:05.365 --> 40:07.031
And we can prove it.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.537
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

40:12.960 --> 40:14.405
They hacked into our server.

40:14.407 --> 40:15.873
They got a copy or...

40:15.875 --> 40:16.974
Wait, wait, wait.

40:16.976 --> 40:19.076
So what they're saying is true?

40:24.017 --> 40:25.249
Is it you?

40:25.251 --> 40:26.897
W-What did you do, Harry?!

40:26.899 --> 40:28.252
He sold the names

40:28.254 --> 40:30.221
of three very wealthy
and powerful people

40:30.223 --> 40:33.024
to an international consortium
that wanted them dead.

40:33.026 --> 40:34.192
He was able to guarantee

40:34.194 --> 40:36.294
that they would all be
in the hotel ballroom

40:36.296 --> 40:38.296
at 10:15 in the morning.

40:38.298 --> 40:40.264
All sitting at the same table.

40:40.266 --> 40:42.099
The table the bomb was attached to.

40:42.101 --> 40:44.807
And it had nothing to do with eco-terror

40:44.809 --> 40:47.538
and everything to do with
how some people are willing

40:47.540 --> 40:50.675
to kill to get people out of the way.

40:52.365 --> 40:54.532
Is any of this true, Harry?

40:56.983 --> 40:58.255
Doesn't matter.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.015
They can't go to anyone with it.

41:01.754 --> 41:03.334
Attorney-client privilege.

41:05.024 --> 41:06.891
Okay.

41:06.893 --> 41:09.974
Now you actually force me
to embarrass myself.

41:10.663 --> 41:12.230
I'm actually not an attorney.

41:12.232 --> 41:13.798
Which, by the way,

41:13.800 --> 41:15.063
is also on your server,

41:15.065 --> 41:16.812
which is why I was able

41:16.814 --> 41:18.002
to call the FBI.

41:18.004 --> 41:19.737
Look, here they are.

41:22.108 --> 41:24.876
Harry Kemp, stand up.

41:24.878 --> 41:26.744
You have the right to remain silent.

41:26.746 --> 41:28.179
Anything you say can and will

41:28.181 --> 41:30.248
be used against you in a court of law.

41:31.076 --> 41:32.583
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

41:32.585 --> 41:34.986
Just let me feed the dog,
and then I promise,

41:34.988 --> 41:37.188
we will go out for a victory dinner.

41:38.925 --> 41:40.425
You have a dog?

41:40.527 --> 41:42.107
I sure do.

41:42.929 --> 41:45.630
It's not one of those little
ball of lint things

41:45.632 --> 41:47.231
that people carry around in their purse,

41:47.233 --> 41:48.966
but like a real dog?

41:53.873 --> 41:55.273
Hi.

41:55.275 --> 41:57.642
Wow, a collie.

41:59.312 --> 42:01.445
Is that real enough for you?

42:01.447 --> 42:03.381
Yeah.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.117
It's kind of perfect.

42:06.119 --> 42:09.020
Wow, lot of books lying around...

42:10.857 --> 42:12.258
fireplace...

42:13.026 --> 42:14.962
and a lot of wood.

42:15.862 --> 42:18.229
I love the open ceilings.

42:20.490 --> 42:22.934
And what am I looking at out here?

42:22.936 --> 42:25.269
That's the Pond in Central Park.

42:27.106 --> 42:29.173
She's got a pond.

42:29.175 --> 42:30.474
Hi, honey.

42:30.476 --> 42:32.777
Hi, mister. Hi.

42:32.779 --> 42:36.614
You have no idea
how much trouble you're in.

42:37.951 --> 42:39.150
You ready?
