02:40.752 --> 02:44.803
Excuse me, can you tell me
this, where Delmare Berry lives?

02:45.802 --> 02:47.171
He ain't here.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.628
Go on inside, baby.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.671
He's a friend of mine...

02:57.760 --> 03:02.256
Well in fact, he wrote his
address down... right here.

03:03.754 --> 03:05.053
Here.

03:05.263 --> 03:07.670
You can see that's Delmare's writing.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.798
I sure had a hard
time finding this place!

03:10.218 --> 03:13.424
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

03:14.134 --> 03:18.090
My name is John Rambo. We served
on the same team together in Nam.

03:18.549 --> 03:20.547
I don't know if he
ever talked about me...

03:22.046 --> 03:25.512
I've got a picture of us together.

03:26.881 --> 03:27.840
Somewhere...

03:28.719 --> 03:30.467
This junk in my pocket!

03:31.546 --> 03:33.254
Here... here it is.

03:33.924 --> 03:38.589
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

03:39.088 --> 03:40.926
and there's Delmare, right in the back.

03:40.926 --> 03:42.795
We had to put him in the
back because he's so big,

03:42.845 --> 03:45.052
if we didn't, he'd take
up the whole picture!

03:45.172 --> 03:46.551
Delmare's gone.

03:48.509 --> 03:51.466
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

03:52.045 --> 03:52.794
What?

03:54.213 --> 03:55.761
Died last summer.

03:57.550 --> 03:59.048
Died how?

03:59.717 --> 04:03.044
Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.551
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

04:08.259 --> 04:12.634
Cut him down to nothing. I
couldn't lift him off the sheet.

04:22.504 --> 04:23.843
I'm very sorry.

05:20.006 --> 05:22.044
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?

05:22.044 --> 05:24.132
- Great, thanks.
- Alright this morning?

05:27.129 --> 05:28.677
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

05:41.385 --> 05:43.802
- Good morning, Dave!
- Hi, Sheriff!

05:44.172 --> 05:45.880
Gonna take a bath this week?!

05:53.962 --> 05:55.011
Morning!

05:59.676 --> 06:02.963
You... you visiting someone around here?

06:04.501 --> 06:05.550
No.

06:07.508 --> 06:11.384
You know, wearing that flag on that
jacket, looking the way you do...

06:12.253 --> 06:14.421
you're askin' for
trouble around here, friend!

06:16.129 --> 06:19.676
- Headed North or South?
- North.

06:20.885 --> 06:24.801
Jump in, I'll make sure you
head in the right direction, huh!

06:36.918 --> 06:39.376
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

06:39.835 --> 06:42.463
Portland is South, you said
you were headed North.

06:43.841 --> 06:45.799
You got some place I
can eat around here?

06:48.007 --> 06:50.585
There's a diner about
30 miles up the highway.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.839
Is there a law against me
getting something to eat here?

06:55.839 --> 06:57.128
Yeah, me.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.884
Why are you pushin' me?

07:02.592 --> 07:04.001
What did you say?

07:05.509 --> 07:07.378
I said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.924
First of all, you don't ask the
questions around here, I do. Understand?

07:11.424 --> 07:16.628
Secondly... we don't want
guys like you in this town.

07:18.426 --> 07:20.045
Drifters.

07:20.085 --> 07:21.543
First thing you know
we got a whole bunch

07:21.543 --> 07:24.051
of guys like you in
this town. That's why!

07:25.879 --> 07:27.547
Besides, you wouldn't like it here...

07:29.625 --> 07:31.293
It's a quiet little town.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.340
In fact, you might say it's boring!

07:35.509 --> 07:37.048
But that's the way we like it.

07:38.796 --> 07:40.924
And I get paid to keep it that way.

07:42.382 --> 07:43.381
Boring...

07:59.505 --> 08:00.834
Portland, straight ahead!

08:03.751 --> 08:05.259
If you want some friendly advice...

08:06.588 --> 08:10.464
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much!

08:10.963 --> 08:12.751
Hope this ride helped you out!

08:19.215 --> 08:21.003
Have a nice day, huh!

08:59.424 --> 09:01.332
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

09:02.921 --> 09:04.419
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, goddammit!

09:09.924 --> 09:10.963
Let's see some I.D.!

09:12.841 --> 09:14.339
All right, you're under arrest!

09:15.008 --> 09:16.757
You hear me? You put
your hands on the car.

09:17.216 --> 09:19.794
Now you put your hands on
the car, and you spread'em.

09:21.712 --> 09:24.089
Are you gonna put
your hands on that car?

09:24.709 --> 09:26.837
How you do it, you
decide, right now!

09:40.463 --> 09:42.091
Put your legs back.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.169
Back!

09:47.086 --> 09:49.623
You try to be nice to some people!

09:53.709 --> 09:55.877
Well, what do we have here, huh?

09:59.713 --> 10:01.461
What would you be
carrying a knife like this?

10:02.540 --> 10:03.380
Hunting.

10:04.498 --> 10:07.545
Don't be a wise guy! What
do you hunt with a knife?

10:09.503 --> 10:10.333
Name it.

10:15.957 --> 10:17.915
- Hi, Will.
- Lester.

10:18.424 --> 10:20.252
Harry, buzz us in, will ya?

10:20.752 --> 10:23.090
Hey, talk about your
sorry looking humanity!

10:23.589 --> 10:25.297
Just another smartass drifter.

10:28.464 --> 10:32.170
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

10:32.630 --> 10:34.628
I want you to book
this gentleman for

10:34.628 --> 10:38.714
vagrancy, resisting arrest,
carrying a concealed weapon.

10:39.213 --> 10:40.632
He says he uses it for hunting.

10:41.671 --> 10:43.958
Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?

10:44.458 --> 10:47.914
See if you can clean him up a
little. He smells like an animal!

10:53.459 --> 10:55.457
Hey, Mitch... Mitch!

10:55.876 --> 10:56.915
Yo!

10:56.915 --> 10:58.004
Escort this young man downstairs.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.293
Yes, sir.

11:00.422 --> 11:02.130
Right this way, partner.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.249
Right here.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.127
That's it.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.379
OK, here we go.

11:17.295 --> 11:18.793
You know, it looks
like it'll take old Leroy

11:18.793 --> 11:20.791
about 10 years to paint this hall!

11:21.081 --> 11:23.209
Why don't you paint it your damned self?

11:23.339 --> 11:25.127
Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

11:25.756 --> 11:26.875
Mr. Ward!

11:28.254 --> 11:30.421
Would you take this for me, please?

11:38.793 --> 11:39.832
Name?

11:45.007 --> 11:46.166
Your name?

11:48.873 --> 11:49.922
Your name!

11:55.126 --> 11:55.956
Name!

11:58.873 --> 12:01.130
Hey... you're lookin' to trouble?

12:01.960 --> 12:03.668
You came at the right place, buddy!

12:04.337 --> 12:05.296
Oh, wait a second.

12:07.414 --> 12:09.672
You got three seconds
before I break your face in!

12:10.541 --> 12:11.959
He means it.

12:12.539 --> 12:13.878
Yeah, I do.

12:32.708 --> 12:36.415
What do you know about that?
Old Harry here is a soldier!

12:37.584 --> 12:39.422
Rambo...

12:40.081 --> 12:41.130
John J.?

12:44.127 --> 12:45.665
You're gonna talk to me.

12:47.044 --> 12:49.172
I promise you're gonna
talk to me, soldier.

12:51.539 --> 12:53.587
I'm starting to dislike you.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.464
A lot.

12:58.462 --> 13:00.500
I'm gonna run a make on him.

13:02.628 --> 13:04.876
Put his name in the Teletype.

13:05.955 --> 13:08.332
Just roll it across.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.211
Roll it across!

13:11.749 --> 13:13.048
Push it.

13:13.048 --> 13:15.705
It won't work that way, it'll
only smear. Roll it across!

13:16.914 --> 13:18.672
Look, you son of a
bitch, if you don't put your

13:18.672 --> 13:21.000
goddamned hand down
there, I'm gonna break it off!

13:21.459 --> 13:25.455
- Put it down, goddammit!
- Art, what the hell's going on down here?

13:25.955 --> 13:27.623
Nothing I can't handle.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.380
He won't let us print him well.

13:31.289 --> 13:32.958
Leave the ink on your hand!

13:35.125 --> 13:36.834
Just what is your problem, huh?

13:38.042 --> 13:40.210
Listen, hardass! As
things stand right now,

13:40.210 --> 13:42.788
you're facing the ass end
of a 90 day incarceration!

13:42.877 --> 13:47.083
Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you
don't look to me like you can pay!

13:48.082 --> 13:50.000
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,
you're going up in front of that judge.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.088
And you think we're tough!

13:53.627 --> 13:54.955
We're gonna make you
look more presentable

13:54.955 --> 13:56.624
for your courtroom appearance.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.210
Between now and then, you can
just impress the hell outta me

14:00.210 --> 14:02.538
by doing exactly as you're told.

14:08.711 --> 14:09.960
Clean him up.

14:10.919 --> 14:13.087
All right, Preston,
I want you to go

14:13.087 --> 14:15.794
over there and get that
hose ready, alright?

14:19.371 --> 14:22.997
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been into?

14:23.456 --> 14:24.835
Who gives a shit?

14:25.914 --> 14:28.252
All right, put your hands on
top of your head and turn around.

14:32.747 --> 14:37.043
Oh, Christ! We should report this
to Teasle, Gault! Look at that!

14:37.502 --> 14:39.370
You just do what I tell you.

14:43.706 --> 14:45.954
Gault, what the fuck was that?

14:46.873 --> 14:49.001
Well, the Man said "clean him up".

14:52.377 --> 14:53.796
Clean him up!

15:02.747 --> 15:08.461
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

15:13.835 --> 15:15.664
How'd you like that, huh?

15:16.083 --> 15:19.630
What's the matter, Mitch?
Don't you like water sports?

15:27.791 --> 15:32.876
All right, hurry it up, it's time for
my coffee break. Alright, sit down!

15:33.376 --> 15:35.084
Sit down!

15:42.996 --> 15:45.503
Damn it, that boy's
hard to get a hold of!

15:47.002 --> 15:49.120
That's OK, Ward, don't worry
about the soap, he's tough.

15:49.459 --> 15:51.377
Just shave him. Dry!

15:51.587 --> 15:52.207
All right...

15:54.085 --> 15:56.912
How blind are you? Can't
you see this guy's crazy?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.539
Can't you see I don't give a shit?

16:00.248 --> 16:02.376
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, that's better.

16:03.086 --> 16:05.203
See there, I knew that you...

16:06.792 --> 16:09.120
We're just going to shave
you partner, take it easy!

16:10.079 --> 16:11.497
Take this, Mitch.

16:16.332 --> 16:17.661
Don't move...

16:18.001 --> 16:19.789
I don't want you to cut your own throat!

16:34.873 --> 16:36.412
You son of a bitch! Come on!

16:55.752 --> 16:56.791
What the hell is...

17:00.957 --> 17:01.996
Art! Art!

17:18.669 --> 17:19.708
Hey, you can't...

17:47.790 --> 17:49.208
I'm gonna kill this asshole!

17:49.378 --> 17:50.457
Art, don't shoot!

17:51.376 --> 17:53.414
Don't shoot, there's people down there!

17:53.494 --> 17:55.582
All right, get help! I'll go after him!

17:58.998 --> 18:00.497
Get outta the way!

19:40.626 --> 19:41.994
Son of a bitch!

19:50.535 --> 19:52.454
Lester, this is Will.
I'm right on his tail.

19:52.953 --> 19:55.291
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.209
I know you can hear me!

21:18.457 --> 21:19.665
You're finished!

21:21.284 --> 21:24.161
You've gone as far as you're gonna go!

21:26.868 --> 21:28.367
D'you hear me?

22:34.200 --> 22:34.909
Mitch!

22:35.539 --> 22:36.368
Lester!

22:37.956 --> 22:39.704
He's up there behind the draw.

22:40.623 --> 22:42.581
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.

22:43.491 --> 22:46.158
Tell him to get out here with
his damned dogs right away.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.206
And tell him to bring the Dobermen!

22:48.825 --> 22:50.623
It's gonna rain, we'll need
dogs that can hunt on sight.

22:51.452 --> 22:53.490
Lester, tell Paul to get
out to the lumber camp

22:53.490 --> 22:54.949
to get the helicopter up here.

22:55.998 --> 22:57.077
If they give him any shit, tell him to

22:57.077 --> 22:59.874
site him for obstruction
right on the spot.

23:02.411 --> 23:03.450
We'll get him!

23:04.329 --> 23:06.407
No problem.

23:38.705 --> 23:40.992
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

23:42.870 --> 23:43.909
Come on, sweethearts!

23:44.749 --> 23:46.077
Let's go get him, babies!

23:48.245 --> 23:51.202
Won't be long before he's
stuffed and mounted, huh Will?

23:52.161 --> 23:53.120
Make him into a bear rug!

23:53.410 --> 23:54.908
Didn't we go hunting here up last year?

23:54.908 --> 23:56.786
Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!

23:57.915 --> 23:59.783
Hey Mitch, up the hill!

24:20.243 --> 24:22.830
Get those hounds away from me,
Orval! I don't trust those bastards!

24:23.329 --> 24:27.116
Keep moving, my dogs can
eat and run at the same time!

24:27.575 --> 24:29.204
He's going straight to the top.

24:30.532 --> 24:32.031
Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?

24:32.031 --> 24:33.289
He's just dumb!

24:50.032 --> 24:53.489
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

24:57.575 --> 24:59.163
- This is no good.
- Why?

25:00.162 --> 25:02.240
There were three of us in
the cell block down there!

25:02.450 --> 25:04.408
He went through us like
we weren't even there!

25:06.076 --> 25:07.115
Oh, come on!

26:19.412 --> 26:21.910
We've got him, go ahead, he's trapped!

26:21.989 --> 26:24.447
Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's
heading for Chapman's gorge.

26:25.076 --> 26:26.575
Chapman's gorge! Head him off!

27:01.909 --> 27:03.697
There he is! On the cliff!

27:21.160 --> 27:22.578
Son of a bitch!

27:30.950 --> 27:32.198
What the hell's going on?

27:32.238 --> 27:34.656
What are you doing? We're
just supposed to spot him!

27:35.155 --> 27:39.031
- Hold it steady.
- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!

27:39.531 --> 27:42.538
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

27:43.037 --> 27:48.612
If you don't ride this thing right,
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

27:50.780 --> 27:52.408
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

27:57.573 --> 27:59.201
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

27:59.571 --> 28:01.868
Galt, come in, goddamn it!

28:02.987 --> 28:05.155
Get closer and hold it steady!

28:05.245 --> 28:07.613
Galt, talk to me, damn it! I
want to know what's going on!

28:11.828 --> 28:13.906
I got him... easy now.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.369
There he is!

29:00.369 --> 29:03.037
Over there, dummy! Come on!

29:07.991 --> 29:09.370
Hey, soldier boy!

29:29.869 --> 29:33.326
Galt, I'm tellin' you to get on this
radio! What's going on up there?

29:35.953 --> 29:38.531
I don't want him dead, Galt,
I want him alive! You hear me?

29:38.531 --> 29:39.570
Art, come in!

30:39.319 --> 30:41.697
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!

30:42.905 --> 30:43.944
Christ, look!

30:47.571 --> 30:50.618
Jesus Christ, gimme the binoculars!

30:52.156 --> 30:54.614
Oh no, no, no! Shit!

31:41.446 --> 31:43.654
I can't figure it... How did he fall out?

31:44.993 --> 31:45.952
Does it matter?

31:46.201 --> 31:48.869
Let's nail this sucker's
ass... He can't be far!

31:49.238 --> 31:50.157
Will!

31:52.695 --> 31:54.783
Looks like he wants to turn himself in!

31:56.741 --> 32:03.074
There's one man dead. It's not my
fault. I don't want any more hurt.

32:03.494 --> 32:05.202
Freeze!

32:05.242 --> 32:07.410
Stay right where you
are and give yourself up!

32:07.909 --> 32:09.778
But I didn't do anything!

32:10.277 --> 32:13.034
I'm warning you, boy, don't make
a move, I'll blow your head off!

32:13.074 --> 32:14.573
I didn't do anything!

32:20.327 --> 32:22.615
Cease fire! Cease fire!

32:23.494 --> 32:25.781
Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!

32:28.029 --> 32:30.527
I think we hit him. Let
us get down there. Move!

32:33.114 --> 32:34.782
Sheriff to base, come in.

32:38.908 --> 32:39.527
Go ahead, Will.

32:39.987 --> 32:41.575
Lester, we're down in the gorge.

32:42.784 --> 32:45.701
Galt's dead, alright? Where the
hell is that goddamned chopper?

32:46.201 --> 32:49.238
He won't come, Will. Says
there's a storm heading your way.

32:49.737 --> 32:51.735
I don't give a goddamned
what's on its way.

32:51.735 --> 32:53.493
I want that chopper back here right now!

32:54.073 --> 32:56.360
I don't want Gault's
body out here all night.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.197
Listen, Will. You sure picked one
hell of a guy to mess around with!

33:00.276 --> 33:01.785
Just came over the
Teletype a few minutes ago.

33:01.785 --> 33:03.283
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.

33:03.743 --> 33:07.909
He's a Green Beret, Congressional
Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!

33:08.069 --> 33:09.777
Jesus, that freak?!

33:09.777 --> 33:12.115
I knew there was
something about that guy!

33:12.864 --> 33:15.991
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

33:20.656 --> 33:22.944
I want you to do what I
told you to do, goddamn it!

33:22.944 --> 33:25.451
Get that chopper back here now! Out.

33:29.197 --> 33:30.776
Green Beret!

33:31.075 --> 33:33.363
War hero!

33:33.573 --> 33:36.150
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

33:37.359 --> 33:38.408
What the hell's the
matter with you guys?

33:38.408 --> 33:40.825
He's one man... wounded!

33:42.324 --> 33:45.451
Those Green Berets... they're
real bad asses.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.778
Why don't you let the
State Police handle this?

33:56.819 --> 33:58.907
Look. Look at him... look at
him! That's Art Gault, boy!

33:59.447 --> 34:01.824
He and I were friends when your

34:01.824 --> 34:04.192
momma was still wiping your nose!

34:04.991 --> 34:08.277
Now he's dead. He's dead!
Because of that psycho out there!

34:08.368 --> 34:09.656
Now you listen boy,
you listen to me good:

34:09.775 --> 34:11.235
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch...

34:11.734 --> 34:14.650
and I'm gonna pin that Congressional
Medal of Honor to his liver!

34:16.070 --> 34:17.109
And I'm gonna do it,

34:17.608 --> 34:20.235
with you, or without you!

34:38.617 --> 34:40.695
We're closin' in, the
scent's getting stronger.

34:41.274 --> 34:42.783
All right, keep your eyes open!

34:47.277 --> 34:49.815
It's gonna storm... it's all we need now!

34:49.815 --> 34:52.443
Will, c'mon, let's get out of
here before it gets too dark.

34:52.572 --> 34:54.360
What's the matter, you
afraid of the boogie man?

34:54.491 --> 34:55.739
You goddamned pansy!

34:58.237 --> 35:00.325
Put your gun down, I'll
show you who the pansy is!

35:02.153 --> 35:04.781
Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!

35:04.781 --> 35:07.408
The fight is out here! He's
out there waiting for you.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.155
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

35:12.113 --> 35:15.280
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

35:15.859 --> 35:17.907
- I'll see you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

35:26.778 --> 35:27.817
There he is!

35:29.815 --> 35:31.404
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

35:32.193 --> 35:34.281
Go get him sweethearts!
Here's your dinner!

35:43.152 --> 35:45.200
Cease fire!

35:50.774 --> 35:52.362
Goddammit, I'm hit!

35:54.900 --> 35:57.607
Jesus, he's got a gun..

36:06.988 --> 36:09.315
It's not him, it's a
goddamned scarecrow!

36:10.274 --> 36:12.232
No scarecrow that
shot Orville, he's close.

36:14.820 --> 36:15.859
Kill him! Go get him!

36:17.027 --> 36:19.115
Go get him, Maggie!

36:31.862 --> 36:35.738
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

36:36.398 --> 36:38.486
Look at his leg!

36:38.486 --> 36:40.154
Mitch, get your belt. Make
a tourniquet around that.

36:40.654 --> 36:42.152
We got to get this guy to a doctor!

36:42.282 --> 36:44.610
Goddamnit, get your belt on that
fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

36:44.649 --> 36:45.648
I left it in the car.

36:46.068 --> 36:46.697
Shit!

36:46.907 --> 36:49.485
- Where did he get that gun?
- It's gotta be Art Gault's gun.

36:49.654 --> 36:51.612
- He's outta ammo...
- How do you know that?

36:51.862 --> 36:54.490
Because whatever killed Orval's
dog was no bullet, that's how!

36:55.239 --> 36:57.317
Hurry up! Orval, listen
to me, now listen!

36:57.776 --> 36:59.195
You have to stay awake, all right?

36:59.484 --> 37:01.572
You have to release that
tourniquet every 15 minutes.

37:01.572 --> 37:04.569
We'll be right back! We go
get him now, he's outta ammo.

37:05.568 --> 37:08.655
Get him! He had no right to shoot
my babies. Get the son of a bitch!

37:08.815 --> 37:10.194
- Let's go!
- Go get him!

37:12.321 --> 37:14.819
All right, now listen up!

37:15.488 --> 37:16.527
We're right on top of him.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.615
We're gonna form a
skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

37:18.775 --> 37:21.073
Keep moving, there's no way
outta here, except through us.

37:25.029 --> 37:27.107
OK, let's do some huntin'...

37:27.776 --> 37:30.773
Huntin'? We ain't
huntin' him, he's huntin' us!

37:45.947 --> 37:48.695
Spread out. Spread out,
dammit! I said 50 feet!

38:14.029 --> 38:15.068
I hate this!

39:29.113 --> 39:30.152
Will, it's Mitch!

39:37.694 --> 39:38.613
Who is it?

40:08.483 --> 40:09.902
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

40:13.438 --> 40:16.066
He's got Ward. Spread
out, I'll go this way.

40:26.065 --> 40:27.104
Will! Over here!

40:31.690 --> 40:32.689
Who's firing?

40:34.397 --> 40:35.446
Who's firing?

40:35.646 --> 40:36.775
I got him!

40:37.564 --> 40:38.902
Shingleton, follow me!

40:44.437 --> 40:45.855
Will, help me!

40:47.154 --> 40:48.193
Help me, Will!

40:54.357 --> 40:55.945
Balford? Where the hell are you?!

41:08.193 --> 41:09.062
Shingleton, over here!

41:26.275 --> 41:27.733
Shingleton, where the hell are you?!

41:52.068 --> 41:55.275
I could have killed'em all.
I could have killed you.

41:56.484 --> 41:58.692
In town you're the law,
out here, it's me!

41:59.821 --> 42:04.396
Don't push it! Don't push it, or I'll
give you a war you won't believe!

42:07.653 --> 42:08.692
Let it go.

42:10.859 --> 42:11.898
Let it go.

43:02.188 --> 43:03.736
Move back, you guys, move back!

43:16.353 --> 43:18.861
How bad is the situation?
Captain, we need some...

43:19.820 --> 43:21.358
That's the only good thing about this,

43:21.358 --> 43:22.937
is the business you're doing in town!

43:23.736 --> 43:25.854
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

43:28.271 --> 43:30.439
You look like you're
ready to keel over, Will.

43:31.148 --> 43:33.486
Why don't you go
home? It's my problem now.

43:33.606 --> 43:36.103
Your problem? Listen Dave,
don't give me any of your

43:36.103 --> 43:38.900
horsehit about jurisdiction
in this one, you understand?

43:39.610 --> 43:42.227
- Should I step outside?
- Just finish up what you're doing.

43:43.775 --> 43:47.192
Somewhere in this rugged mountain
countryside, possibly above the snow line,

43:48.361 --> 43:51.438
shrouded in mist, the
fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.

43:51.528 --> 43:52.856
Units of the state
police along with local

43:52.856 --> 43:56.902
members of the National
Guard are now being mobilized.

43:57.522 --> 43:59.979
What still remains
unexplained by local authorities

43:59.979 --> 44:01.897
is just how and where
the former Green Beret

44:02.317 --> 44:03.605
came into possession of the weapons

44:03.605 --> 44:06.522
with which he allegedly
killed one deputy sheriff,

44:06.942 --> 44:08.231
and tried to kill 6 others.

44:08.610 --> 44:10.478
Only their skilled training
in police enforcement

44:10.478 --> 44:12.357
techniques saved their lives.

44:12.436 --> 44:14.354
And word now is that
the fugitive will be

44:14.354 --> 44:16.482
in custody in a matter of hours.

44:18.560 --> 44:19.769
Maps, Will.

44:21.228 --> 44:23.645
Will, there's something
I think you oughta know.

44:24.734 --> 44:26.103
I'll talk to you later, OK?

44:26.562 --> 44:28.730
What is it, Lester? What is it
for Christ sake, spit it out!

44:31.687 --> 44:35.143
Well, I was just talkin' to
Mitch, and he was sayin' that

44:35.143 --> 44:39.059
Gault and a couple of deputies
were... a little hard on the guy.

44:39.609 --> 44:40.648
Assholes!

44:41.817 --> 44:45.103
It doesn't make one goddammed bit
of difference, Dave, and you know it!

44:47.401 --> 44:51.227
If one of my deputies... gets
outta line with a prisoner,

44:51.227 --> 44:52.606
then the prisoner
comes to me with it!

44:53.315 --> 44:55.603
And if I find out it's like he
says, I kick the deputy's ass!

44:55.693 --> 44:58.110
Me, the law! That's
the way it's gotta be.

45:00.068 --> 45:03.355
People start fuckin' around with
the law, and all hell breaks loose.

45:06.771 --> 45:08.480
Whatever possessed God in
heaven to make a man like Rambo?

45:09.269 --> 45:10.568
God didn't make Rambo.

45:12.146 --> 45:13.185
I made him.

45:13.734 --> 45:14.773
Who the hell are you?

45:15.353 --> 45:18.190
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

45:19.229 --> 45:21.726
We're a little busy this morning,
Colonel, what can I do for ya?

45:21.726 --> 45:23.644
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

45:24.274 --> 45:28.230
I recruited him, I trained him, I
commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

45:29.439 --> 45:30.477
I'd say that makes him mine.

45:30.767 --> 45:33.025
I wonder why the Pentagon would

45:33.025 --> 45:36.102
send a full bird Colonel to handle this?

45:36.941 --> 45:39.059
The army thought I
might be able to help.

45:39.149 --> 45:40.897
I don't know in what way.

45:40.897 --> 45:42.685
Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.

45:44.234 --> 45:48.309
I don't think you understand. I didn't
come here to rescue Rambo from you.

45:48.519 --> 45:50.607
I came here to rescue you from him.

45:52.146 --> 45:54.313
Well, we all appreciate
your concern, Colonel.

45:55.063 --> 45:56.601
We'll try to be extra careful!

45:57.860 --> 46:00.227
I'm just amazed he allowed
any of your posse to live.

46:01.067 --> 46:02.026
Is that right?

46:02.395 --> 46:05.852
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing!

46:05.852 --> 46:06.901
That's just great!

46:08.559 --> 46:09.318
Colonel, you came out here

46:09.318 --> 46:12.025
to find out why one of
your machines blew a gasket!

46:12.685 --> 46:14.643
You don't seem to want to
accept the fact that you're

46:14.643 --> 46:17.270
dealing with an expert
in guerilla warfare.

46:17.939 --> 46:19.318
With a man who's the best.

46:19.728 --> 46:22.025
With guns, with knives,
with his bare hands.

46:22.685 --> 46:26.561
A man who's been trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.438
To live off the land...

46:29.438 --> 46:31.815
To eat things that would
make a billy goat puke.

46:32.814 --> 46:37.100
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose
of enemy personnel, to kill... period!

46:38.019 --> 46:42.065
Win by attrition. Well,
Rambo was the best!

47:38.148 --> 47:40.516
OK, Colonel, now you've
got us all scared to death.

47:40.516 --> 47:42.894
What do you and the Special Forces think

47:43.023 --> 47:45.271
I oughta do about your psycho out there?

47:47.149 --> 47:48.148
Let him go.

47:48.228 --> 47:49.896
- Do what?
- For now.

47:51.315 --> 47:53.313
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.

47:54.142 --> 47:56.440
Provide a little gap and
let him slip through it.

47:56.939 --> 47:59.816
Then put out a nation wide
APB. In a couple of weeks,

47:59.816 --> 48:02.604
you'll pick him up in Seattle or
someplace, working in a car wash.

48:02.644 --> 48:04.102
There'll be no fight and
nobody else will get hurt.

48:04.102 --> 48:06.689
I do my own work. I don't
figure the best way to do that is

48:06.689 --> 48:09.397
to close my eyes and then hope
he gets picked up in Seattle!

48:10.186 --> 48:12.314
If you send your people in
there after him, they'll get killed!

48:12.394 --> 48:15.021
You know, we're just a small
hick town Sheriff's department,

48:15.021 --> 48:17.099
Colonel, but we're
expected to do our duty

48:17.149 --> 48:19.227
just like our heroes
in the Special Forces.

48:19.476 --> 48:22.683
In Special Forces, we teach our
people to stay alive in the line of duty.

48:23.233 --> 48:24.691
No shit, I never thought of that!

48:24.691 --> 48:25.770
You want a war you can't win?

48:25.850 --> 48:30.066
Are you tellin' me that 200 men against
your boy is a no win situation for us?

48:30.355 --> 48:32.064
You send that many,
don't forget one thing.

48:32.184 --> 48:33.063
What?

48:33.392 --> 48:35.061
A good supply of body-bags!

48:38.647 --> 48:39.766
Trautman!

48:42.603 --> 48:44.391
I don't know which side
you're on, Trautman...

48:45.021 --> 48:47.478
I still think you came out
here just to cover your ass.

48:47.858 --> 48:51.974
But if you're serious about taking
Rambo out clean, follow me...

49:13.272 --> 49:16.479
State police calling John
Rambo. Acknowledge.

49:22.852 --> 49:27.857
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

49:29.685 --> 49:33.482
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded.

49:33.522 --> 49:36.269
Every possible exit has been blocked,

49:36.269 --> 49:38.856
every highway, every
road, every fire break.

49:39.066 --> 49:40.774
You have our word that
your services to your

49:40.774 --> 49:42.522
country will be taken
into consideration.

49:42.682 --> 49:44.271
And you'll receive fair treatment.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.647
Just respond, we can
work everything out... over.

49:48.476 --> 49:49.266
Anything?

49:49.895 --> 49:53.521
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

49:54.141 --> 49:55.519
If I was in his position,
I'd try to pick up

49:55.519 --> 49:57.897
some information. Maybe
catch some cross talk.

49:58.436 --> 49:59.266
Of course, he's listening.

49:59.515 --> 50:00.974
He's not gonna break radio silence.

50:00.974 --> 50:04.101
No, not for us, but he
might do it for you, Colonel.

50:04.770 --> 50:06.308
He's your boy, isn't he?

50:09.185 --> 50:12.812
Maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

50:13.731 --> 50:14.810
I can try.

50:15.389 --> 50:17.767
At least, we'd get a
radio fix on his position,

50:17.767 --> 50:19.225
if you don't mind
setting him up for us...

50:19.265 --> 50:20.684
Setting him up for you?

50:21.393 --> 50:23.271
It's like bringing the
pigeons to the cat!

50:29.225 --> 50:30.814
Thanks for bringing your people out.

50:30.894 --> 50:31.773
Any time, Will.

50:31.853 --> 50:33.980
C'mon, Bobby, put the
magazine away, will ya?

50:33.980 --> 50:36.648
Pay attention. I mean we
may only get one crack at this.

50:41.812 --> 50:44.809
Company leader calling
Raven. Come on Raven.

50:47.647 --> 50:49.145
Company leader calling Raven.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.807
Company leader to
Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.

50:59.065 --> 51:01.313
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

51:02.312 --> 51:06.767
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

51:06.897 --> 51:11.522
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

51:12.222 --> 51:13.061
Confirm.

51:13.980 --> 51:15.229
This is Colonel Trautman.

51:17.516 --> 51:18.765
Talk to me, Johnny.

51:33.890 --> 51:35.558
They're all gone, Sir.

51:36.058 --> 51:39.814
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

51:39.854 --> 51:41.642
Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.

51:42.981 --> 51:45.728
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

51:46.227 --> 51:47.806
Berry's gone too, Sir.

51:49.264 --> 51:50.183
How?

51:50.893 --> 51:52.601
Got himself killed in Nam...

51:52.731 --> 51:56.097
Didn't even know it. Cancer
ate him down to the bone.

51:57.396 --> 51:59.224
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

52:00.473 --> 52:02.101
I'm the last one, Sir.

52:02.980 --> 52:06.017
It's good to hear your voice,
Johnny. It's been a long time!

52:07.975 --> 52:10.513
Look, John, you've
done some damage here,

52:10.513 --> 52:11.522
but they don't want any more trouble.

52:11.642 --> 52:12.980
He's north-west!

52:13.520 --> 52:15.098
That's why I've come.

52:16.347 --> 52:18.015
I'm gonna come in
and fly you the hell out.

52:18.055 --> 52:21.971
Just you and me. We'll work this
out together. Is that fair enough?

52:22.980 --> 52:24.269
Where'd you come from, Sir?

52:24.688 --> 52:25.727
Bragg.

52:27.476 --> 52:28.644
I tried to get in touch with you,

52:28.644 --> 52:30.852
but the guys at Bragg
never knew where to find you.

52:30.932 --> 52:33.230
Well, I haven't been spending
much time there lately,

52:33.230 --> 52:36.347
they've got me down in DC.
I'm shining a seat with my ass.

52:36.976 --> 52:38.804
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

52:41.811 --> 52:43.639
We'll talk about that when you come in.

52:43.639 --> 52:45.308
I can't do that, Sir.

52:48.394 --> 52:50.682
Well, look, John, we can't have
you running around out there,

52:50.772 --> 52:52.141
wasting friendly civilians.

52:52.770 --> 52:55.727
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

52:56.806 --> 52:59.144
I was there with you, knee
deep in blood and guts.

53:00.182 --> 53:01.971
I covered your ass more than once!

53:04.978 --> 53:06.306
Seems like bailing you out of trouble

53:06.306 --> 53:07.975
is becoming a lifetime job for me!

53:08.144 --> 53:10.812
There wouldn't be no trouble
except for that king shit cop!

53:11.891 --> 53:13.269
All I wanted was something to eat.

53:14.808 --> 53:16.516
But the man kept pushin', Sir.

53:17.555 --> 53:19.393
Well, you did some
pushin' on your own, John!

53:20.472 --> 53:22.020
They drew first blood, not me.

53:22.100 --> 53:23.059
Look Johnny...

53:24.308 --> 53:26.186
Let me come in, and get
you the hell outta there.

53:28.304 --> 53:30.352
They drew first blood...

53:38.054 --> 53:40.931
Rambo! Are you still reading me?

53:45.726 --> 53:47.395
Company leader to Raven!

53:48.723 --> 53:49.972
Rambo, acknowledge!

53:51.561 --> 53:53.059
He's all finished, Colonel!

53:54.228 --> 53:56.056
We've got a real good fix on him now.

53:56.476 --> 53:58.973
Come first light, I'm gonna put
every man I got upon that ridge.

53:59.812 --> 54:01.431
Then we'll get him my way!

54:07.225 --> 54:08.893
Goddammit.

54:10.561 --> 54:11.430
Goddammit!

54:21.720 --> 54:23.478
Come on, move it!

54:25.346 --> 54:26.185
Let's go!

54:28.223 --> 54:29.932
Does this guy got a gun?

55:40.810 --> 55:42.059
There's the guy the
cops are shootin' at!

55:42.059 --> 55:45.056
I see him over there,
I'll get him, I'll get him!

55:45.555 --> 55:46.764
Don't shoot!

55:48.013 --> 55:49.102
This way! Let's go!

55:55.895 --> 55:57.473
There he is! Come on!

56:14.806 --> 56:16.554
Now we got him!

56:20.520 --> 56:23.267
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully.

56:23.806 --> 56:25.934
Surround the area with every
man you've got, but don't move in.

56:25.934 --> 56:27.303
I repeat: don't move in!

56:27.303 --> 56:30.220
Don't do anything till I get
there! And no shooting!

56:30.430 --> 56:32.018
I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

56:49.930 --> 56:51.678
Keep firing!

56:53.726 --> 56:55.644
Come on guys, shoot!

56:57.512 --> 56:58.761
Come on!

57:01.099 --> 57:02.308
You guys are great!

57:03.426 --> 57:04.555
- All right, Steve.
- Yo!

57:05.095 --> 57:06.343
I want you and Bruce,
head around these trees,

57:06.343 --> 57:07.472
go to the front of that mine.

57:07.512 --> 57:09.510
Screw that Clint, but
I ain't goin' up there!

57:09.510 --> 57:10.429
No way!

57:15.224 --> 57:16.393
- Brandon?
- What?

57:17.352 --> 57:20.060
- I want you to go into that mine.
- No, not me!

57:20.060 --> 57:21.019
What do you mean, not me?!

57:21.428 --> 57:23.726
Look, I do this part time, I
didn't come here to get killed.

57:23.936 --> 57:26.643
He's probably just waitin' for us!

57:26.683 --> 57:28.051
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

57:32.677 --> 57:36.593
Rambo! This is
Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

57:37.392 --> 57:39.060
National Guard leader.

57:40.559 --> 57:44.974
And I'm giving you just
3.0 seconds to come on out.

57:47.052 --> 57:49.010
Who's got the rocket launcher?

57:49.510 --> 57:50.968
- I do.
- Come here, Earl.

57:51.058 --> 57:51.887
Right!

57:52.926 --> 57:56.473
Rambo! This is your
last chance to come out.

57:57.602 --> 57:59.390
Maybe we should wait.

57:59.849 --> 58:02.307
Earl, this creep is a killer!

58:02.307 --> 58:04.974
Besides, I'm in charge
and I say we blow it up!

58:05.224 --> 58:08.930
Now fire that thing! Just let
me get outta the way first.

58:34.634 --> 58:35.843
Give that man a cigar!

58:36.592 --> 58:37.851
Bull's eye!

59:17.930 --> 59:21.017
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

59:24.434 --> 59:26.052
Move in a little closer,
just like Iwa Jima.

59:28.719 --> 59:31.217
I don't believe it! Idiots!

59:32.136 --> 59:34.514
All right, one more for
"Soldier of Fortune"!

59:34.593 --> 59:35.642
Soldier of Fortune?!

59:36.142 --> 59:39.219
Dammit, what the hell do you
think this is, some kind of a circus?

59:39.349 --> 59:40.677
Get the hell outta here!

59:42.885 --> 59:43.634
Clinton, Jesus!

59:44.723 --> 59:46.142
Didn't you get the word, Clinton?

59:46.142 --> 59:48.100
I told you people to
wait until I got up here!

59:48.140 --> 59:49.508
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!

59:49.508 --> 59:51.806
Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.

59:54.433 --> 59:55.432
What a mess!

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.178
We have to dig his body
out of there right away.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.015
You can't get a dozer up here,

01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.883
you're gonna have to find
somebody to dig him out!

01:00:05.262 --> 01:00:06.891
It's your mess, Clinton!
You clean it up.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.928
Will, come on... I gotta be back
at the drug store tomorrow!

01:00:09.968 --> 01:00:12.475
You'd better get started
right away, Clinton!

01:00:15.592 --> 01:00:16.641
Shit!

01:01:01.635 --> 01:01:04.223
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
goddamned weekend warriors!

01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:07.300
Thought you said he was
the best you ever trained!

01:01:08.259 --> 01:01:09.597
However he may have ended up,

01:01:09.597 --> 01:01:11.425
there was a time when
he was very special.

01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:14.802
'Special', my ass! He was just
another drifter that broke the law.

01:01:14.882 --> 01:01:16.341
Vagrancy, wasn't it?

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.677
That's gonna look real good on
his gravestone in Arlington:

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:23.803
"Here lies John Rambo, winner of
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:01:24.302 --> 01:01:27.259
Survivor of countless
incursions behind enemy lines.

01:01:28.428 --> 01:01:30.886
Killed for vagrancy,
in 'Jerkwater', USA.

01:01:31.725 --> 01:01:33.633
Don't give me any of
that crap, Trautman!

01:01:34.592 --> 01:01:37.849
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam?

01:01:38.009 --> 01:01:40.636
He killed a police
officer, for Christ sake!

01:01:40.636 --> 01:01:42.514
You're goddamned lucky
he didn't kill all of you...

01:01:59.807 --> 01:02:02.224
This character! He
comes waltzing in here,

01:02:02.224 --> 01:02:03.802
full of all kinds of good advice.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.849
And wished we'd let that
goddamned maniac go on the loose,

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:08.098
so we could save our own asses!

01:02:08.218 --> 01:02:11.465
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!
And we didn't let him go on the loose.

01:02:12.014 --> 01:02:16.300
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:52.013
- How you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

01:06:12.671 --> 01:06:13.720
Colonel?

01:06:18.305 --> 01:06:19.214
Have a seat.

01:06:25.428 --> 01:06:27.965
Oh miss, can you do this again, please?

01:06:27.965 --> 01:06:30.463
- Oh sure!
- And for my friend...?

01:06:30.922 --> 01:06:33.470
A shot of wild turkey.

01:06:35.178 --> 01:06:40.013
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

01:06:42.171 --> 01:06:44.339
None of that makes much
difference now, does it?

01:06:46.257 --> 01:06:47.635
No, I guess not.

01:06:49.883 --> 01:06:52.171
I suppose...

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.718
I just feel...

01:06:57.096 --> 01:07:00.672
Like you were... cheated
outta your chance?

01:07:01.262 --> 01:07:03.050
I wanted to kill that kid.

01:07:04.428 --> 01:07:06.796
I wanted to kill him so
bad, I could taste it.

01:07:08.344 --> 01:07:10.422
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.089
It can get confusing sometimes...

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.384
In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and

01:07:18.384 --> 01:07:22.420
I got pretty confused. But we had orders.

01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:25.967
When in doubt... kill!

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:31.761
But what the hell, you're a civilian.

01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:34.508
You can go home to your wife,

01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:36.136
and your house and
your little flower garden.

01:07:36.596 --> 01:07:38.504
You're under no pressure
to figure all this out.

01:07:38.634 --> 01:07:39.503
And what about you, Colonel?

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:41.051
What did you figure
out from all of this, huh?

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:44.258
I mean what would you have
done with him if he came in?

01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:47.005
Would you wrap your arms
around him to give a big sloppy kiss?

01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:49.423
Or would you have blown his brains out?

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.961
I couldn't answer that
until I met him face to face.

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:06.086
Well, there it is.

01:08:07.714 --> 01:08:11.301
Just as well we never
got a chance to find out.

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:03.427
Drive!

01:10:06.085 --> 01:10:10.011
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen!

01:10:11.089 --> 01:10:14.176
- What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

01:10:14.636 --> 01:10:16.464
All right, what do you
got in the back, Robert A.?

01:10:17.043 --> 01:10:18.552
M60.

01:10:21.919 --> 01:10:24.965
- OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you!

01:10:26.214 --> 01:10:27.213
Go home! Move, go home!

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:54.755
Want to turn that up?

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:00.420
What's your story, Steamboat?

01:11:00.959 --> 01:11:03.257
Looks like somebody
pulled the plug too soon...

01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:06.214
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!

01:11:06.214 --> 01:11:07.253
Shit!

01:11:10.549 --> 01:11:13.796
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!

01:14:55.462 --> 01:14:58.998
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

01:15:24.213 --> 01:15:26.091
What the hell is going on?!

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:31.795
- Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

01:15:41.965 --> 01:15:44.252
Attention, all civilians!

01:15:45.132 --> 01:15:49.207
For your own safety, please
evacuate the streets immediately.

01:15:50.336 --> 01:15:53.793
Remain indoors until you
receive further instructions.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:56.630
I repeat: this is a police emergency.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:59.377
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:19.916
They found Rambo's body...

01:16:20.626 --> 01:16:23.583
As a matter of fact,
he stole an army truck

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:26.040
and blew up a gas station
on the other side of town.

01:16:26.789 --> 01:16:28.248
The kid is resilient.

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:31.914
Why don't you forget what you're
thinking and clear out while you can?

01:16:32.673 --> 01:16:34.961
Get the fuck outta here, Trautman!
You take your advice with you.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.748
When I talked to you
earlier this afternoon,

01:16:37.748 --> 01:16:40.416
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

01:16:41.794 --> 01:16:43.293
I suspected it.

01:16:43.622 --> 01:16:48.587
Sure... Sure, that's why you
stuck around. You trained him.

01:16:48.877 --> 01:16:51.335
You taught him how to get
out of places like that cave.

01:16:52.294 --> 01:16:54.212
But he's not gonna
get out of this place!

01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:57.129
Teasle, you and all your men
couldn't handle him before,

01:16:57.129 --> 01:16:58.957
what makes you think
you can handle him now?

01:17:00.086 --> 01:17:02.084
Because God knows what
damage he's prepared to do.

01:17:14.131 --> 01:17:15.630
You're gonna die, Teasle.

01:17:16.289 --> 01:17:17.958
Everybody dies!

01:17:19.047 --> 01:17:21.414
There's only one man in this
room that has half a chance.

01:17:21.414 --> 01:17:23.332
That's not because
I'm better than he is.

01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:25.330
But it's because he trusts me.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:27.798
See, I'm the closest thing
to family that he has left,

01:17:27.918 --> 01:17:30.255
and that may be all the edge I need.

01:17:30.715 --> 01:17:32.962
Jesus Christ, where do
you people come from?

01:17:38.167 --> 01:17:40.964
This is my job Trautman,
this is my town!

01:17:41.334 --> 01:17:44.830
And I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.707
Now you just stay the hell outta my way!

01:17:57.957 --> 01:18:00.085
- Get a little closer!
- I can't!

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.544
It's too goddamned hot!

01:18:03.462 --> 01:18:05.290
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:10.544
Come on, let's go! Will, this
is Lester, do you copy, over?

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:16.748
Listen Will, we've got some serious
problems. The highway's been cut off.

01:18:16.788 --> 01:18:20.045
The truck's out here, but
we couldn't find the body.

01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:22.043
I repeat: no body,
it's totally burnt out.

01:18:22.043 --> 01:18:24.001
Preston, get those people outta here!

01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:27.038
Move them back to the south side.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:33.581
We don't know how many gas
tanks there are under the pumps...

01:24:24.876 --> 01:24:27.833
Go ahead... go ahead!

01:24:28.582 --> 01:24:30.620
Go ahead, you crazy
son of a bitch, finish me!

01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:31.749
Rambo!

01:24:32.748 --> 01:24:34.286
Rambo, don't do it!

01:24:35.245 --> 01:24:36.584
Listen to me, Rambo!

01:24:36.874 --> 01:24:37.912
You have no chance.

01:24:39.411 --> 01:24:40.410
Drop your weapon.

01:24:41.998 --> 01:24:45.455
We're gonna order a chopper
in and fly you back to Bragg.

01:24:47.743 --> 01:24:48.831
Hold your fire!

01:24:53.537 --> 01:24:54.456
Hold your fire!

01:24:54.785 --> 01:24:56.534
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:24:57.663 --> 01:24:59.121
Think about what you're doin'.

01:25:01.119 --> 01:25:04.416
The building's perimeter's
covered. No exits.

01:25:05.075 --> 01:25:07.792
There's nearly 200 men
out there and a lot of M16s!

01:25:08.242 --> 01:25:10.460
You did everything to make
this private war happen.

01:25:11.828 --> 01:25:13.626
You've done enough damage!

01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:16.334
This mission is over, Rambo.
Do you understand me?

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:18.951
This mission is over!

01:25:22.537 --> 01:25:23.876
Look at 'em out there.

01:25:27.163 --> 01:25:28.162
Look at 'em!

01:25:31.328 --> 01:25:33.037
If you won't end this
happen, they'll kill you!

01:25:34.575 --> 01:25:35.994
Is that what you want?

01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:42.207
It's over, Johnny. It's OVER!

01:25:42.577 --> 01:25:47.202
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

01:25:47.912 --> 01:25:51.248
It wasn't my war. You
asked me, I didn't ask you!

01:25:52.077 --> 01:25:55.244
And I did what I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

01:25:55.834 --> 01:25:58.291
And I come back to
the world, and I see all

01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:00.998
those maggots at the
airport, protestin' me, spittin'.

01:26:01.498 --> 01:26:03.955
Callin' me baby killer
and all kinds of vile crap!

01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:07.911
Who are they to protest
me, huh? Who are they?

01:26:08.081 --> 01:26:09.660
Unless they've been me and been there,

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.328
and know what the
hell they're yellin' about?

01:26:11.368 --> 01:26:14.784
It was a bad time for everyone,
Rambo. It's all in the past now.

01:26:14.824 --> 01:26:17.452
FOR YOU! For me,
civilian life is nothing.

01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:19.829
In the field, we had a code of honor.

01:26:20.079 --> 01:26:23.326
You watch my back, I watch
yours. Back here, there's nothing!

01:26:23.456 --> 01:26:27.372
You're the last of an elite
group... don't end it like this.

01:26:27.372 --> 01:26:29.999
Back there I could fly a
gunship, I could drive a tank,

01:26:30.079 --> 01:26:32.037
I was in charge of a
million dollar equipment!

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:35.284
Back here, I can't even
hold a job parking cars!

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:46.412
Where is everybody?

01:26:52.616 --> 01:26:55.284
I had a friend, who
was in the Air Force.

01:26:57.042 --> 01:27:01.327
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

01:27:01.827 --> 01:27:03.455
Who were my friends!

01:27:03.495 --> 01:27:06.702
Back here, there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:09.159
Wore this black headband.

01:27:09.369 --> 01:27:11.457
I took one of his magic
markers, and I said:

01:27:11.537 --> 01:27:14.035
"If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",

01:27:14.035 --> 01:27:15.783
'cause we were always
talkin' about Vegas,

01:27:15.873 --> 01:27:19.499
and this fuckin' car. This so
great '58 Chevy convertible!

01:27:19.499 --> 01:27:20.868
He was talkin' about his car,

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:23.915
he said we'd get cruised
till the tires fell off!

01:27:31.827 --> 01:27:33.994
We were in this bar in
Saigon, and this kid comes up,

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.702
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:39.499
And there, he says:
"Shine please, shine!"

01:27:40.038 --> 01:27:43.205
I said no, and he kept askin',
yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.

01:27:43.705 --> 01:27:45.533
And... I went to get a couple of beers.

01:27:46.242 --> 01:27:49.289
And the box was wired.
He opened up the box...

01:27:49.748 --> 01:27:51.577
Fucking blew his
body all over the place.

01:27:52.825 --> 01:27:54.284
He's laying there and
he's fucking screaming,

01:27:54.284 --> 01:27:55.832
there's pieces of him all over me!

01:27:57.241 --> 01:28:01.207
And I'm trying to pull them off, you
know... my friend! It's all over me!

01:28:01.996 --> 01:28:03.325
I got blood and everything and...

01:28:03.325 --> 01:28:05.872
I'm trying to hold him
together, I put him together

01:28:05.912 --> 01:28:07.870
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.158
And nobody would help!

01:28:10.657 --> 01:28:14.703
He's saying, sayin', "I want to
go home!" just calling my name.

01:28:15.163 --> 01:28:17.870
"I wanna go home, Johnny,
I wanna drive my Chevy!"

01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:20.078
I said: "Why I can't
find your fuckin' legs. "

01:28:20.997 --> 01:28:22.495
"I can't find your legs!"

01:28:24.244 --> 01:28:28.869
I can't get it out of my
head. It was seven years.

01:28:29.368 --> 01:28:30.867
Every day it hurts.

01:28:31.366 --> 01:28:37.160
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:39.868
Sometimes a day.

01:28:41.666 --> 01:28:43.454
Sometimes a week.

01:28:44.623 --> 01:28:47.290
I can't put it outta my mind...
