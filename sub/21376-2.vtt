00:20.437 --> 00:22.063

Make some noise.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.107
Make some noise.
Make some noise.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.277
Welcome to "Hood Adjacent."
I'm your host James Davis.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.906
Give it up for my DJ, Norm
"Thump" Nixon in the building.

00:31.990 --> 00:36.369
{\an1}Now, this episode is for the
people who think OJ did it and

00:36.453 --> 00:41.583
the ones who know he did it but
celebrated his innocence anyway.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.584
[laughter and applause]

00:42.667 --> 00:45.587
Now,
tonight we're getting woke.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.423
Now, being woke is being
aware of what's going on in your

00:48.506 --> 00:50.800
community, and in the past year,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.635
activism has
been like a Migos song.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.097
It's everywhere, and all
of a sudden, it's mainstream.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.975
We all need to be woke,
'cause things are bad.

00:59.058 --> 01:02.812
How bad?
They spray-painted the word

01:02.896 --> 01:08.985
"nigger" on LeBron's front gate
before game one of the finals.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.821
And his response was,
"It's not easy

01:11.905 --> 01:13.406
being black in America."

01:13.490 --> 01:14.199
Now, that's something
Ja Rule should

01:14.282 --> 01:18.661
be saying, not LeBron James.

01:18.745 --> 01:23.082
This is--this is LeBron
James we're talking about.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.251
He's a billionaire.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.630
He's so rich, it should be easy
to be a black man in America.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.632
The only thing that
should be hard for him is the

01:30.715 --> 01:34.135
slow pace of advancement
in hair transplant technology.

01:34.219 --> 01:38.223
That's it.
He's just there practicin'.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.808
"I'm workin' on my game.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.850
"Why can't they
get their game together?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.894
"You know what I'm saying?

01:42.977 --> 01:44.854
"Why can't they put the
stem cell with the sickle cell,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.524
put the lime in the coconut,
and bring me back to prom?"

01:47.607 --> 01:52.195
Now, I'm sure you all know about
the inequality in this country.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.365
It's so bad they have
inequality in activism.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.201
And that's crazy.
I mean, why is it that some

01:58.284 --> 02:01.871
forms of activism are
more acceptable than others?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.790
We praised the Women's March,

02:03.873 --> 02:06.668
the Trump tax day protest,
and the March for Science.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.836
I mean,
when the Muslim ban went down,

02:08.919 --> 02:11.923
thousands of people nationwide
protested at airports.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.676
Can you imagine if brothers and

02:14.759 --> 02:18.513
sisters showed up to the
airports, thousandseses of us?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.139
[laughter]

02:20.223 --> 02:22.976
People
would think one of two things.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.937
Either Katt Williams is
performing in baggage claim...

02:26.020 --> 02:28.231
[laughter and applause]

02:31.234 --> 02:34.571
Or--or
they're filming "Soul Plane 2."

02:34.654 --> 02:38.533
[laughter]

02:38.616 --> 02:41.286
But that same support
we see for other issues

02:41.369 --> 02:45.290
isn't there for black-tivism.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.458
As my brother
D.J. Khaled would say,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.085
"They don't want us to march.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.461
They don't want us to take
a knee."

02:50.545 --> 02:54.424
Now, why is it with all
the bad press NFL players have

02:54.507 --> 02:56.843
gotten over the years
that we demonize the one

02:56.926 --> 03:00.555
player that actually used his
platform for something positive?

03:00.638 --> 03:04.851
[cheers and applause]

03:04.934 --> 03:09.147
Colin Kaepernick donated $1
million to charity last year.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.316
And he's unemployed.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.401
He's in the same
position as Lamar Odom.

03:13.484 --> 03:17.238
That's wrong.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.449
And how come--
and how come nobody gets in

03:19.532 --> 03:22.285
their feelings when other people
use their platforms to protest?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.787
Did anyone boycott "The
Wolf of Wall Street" when we

03:24.871 --> 03:27.123
found out that Leo was
woke about climate change?

03:27.206 --> 03:29.626
No, we all showed up to
that theater and watched him

03:29.709 --> 03:32.545
snort cocaine out of that
immaculate white girl's ass.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.631
Yes, we did.
Yes, we did.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.635
Ya did. I did.
Twice. Love that scene.

03:38.718 --> 03:43.473
Best scene of the movie.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.433
Now, the main
critique about activism

03:45.516 --> 03:47.143
that I hear is that there's too

03:47.226 --> 03:49.979
much complaining
and not enough action.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.316
Well, you know what? Tonight,
we're gonna handle our problems.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.194
We're gonna fix it on our own,
the "Hood Adjacent" way.

03:56.277 --> 04:00.740
[cheers and applause]

04:00.823 --> 04:03.576
Now, it's no news flash that
it's hard

04:03.660 --> 04:04.827
being black in America.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.579
But here's a shocking statistic.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.165
The Center for Disease Control
found that black male

04:09.248 --> 04:12.794
pedestrians are twice as likely
to be killed by cars

04:12.877 --> 04:14.921
when crossing the street.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.464
And a study done by UNLV found
that motorists were

04:17.548 --> 04:21.260
seven times more likely not to
stop for a black person

04:21.344 --> 04:22.971
than a white one.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.808
I guess all lives matter,
except in crosswalks.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.018
Crosswalks are so
safe for white people,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.980
the homey James Corden films
musicals in the middle of them.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.481
Just costume and everything.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.191
- I seen that shit, bro.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.067
Like, I heard next season
they doing "Fences"

04:36.150 --> 04:37.568
on Crenshaw and Slauson.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.195
- That's how
safe it is for them.

04:39.278 --> 04:42.115
Point is,
"walking while black" is another

04:42.198 --> 04:44.951
issue facing our community,
but we're not helpless.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.370
All it takes is real
common sense solutions.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.622
So step into my laboratory.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.332
Beautiful day to
save lives, ain't it?

{\an1}they don't see me if I'm on my
phone, anything like that.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.028
I just make sure I'm

08:07.111 --> 08:09.447

17:46.148 --> 17:49.651
Welcome back to
"Between Two DeRays."

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

17:52.738 --> 17:56.575
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:56.658 --> 17:58.494
Black activism.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.162
What is a proper way to protest?

18:00.245 --> 18:03.040
{\an8}- I don't think there's
any one way to protest.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.958
{\an8}The thing about protest is,
it's an idea of telling the

18:05.042 --> 18:06.502
{\an8}truth in public; there are many
ways you can do that.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.378
{\an8}- I like you just be like,
"Naw."

18:08.462 --> 18:11.465
{\an7}- So the beginning of any
protest is just stating, "Naw"?

18:11.548 --> 18:12.591
{\an3}- Naw. It's like, "Naw, I don't
want--

18:12.674 --> 18:14.802
I don't like how this going.
Naw, bruh."

18:14.885 --> 18:16.804
- What are your thoughts on
reparations?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.680
- Reparations at its core is
this idea of acknowledge

18:18.764 --> 18:20.307
and repair, right?

18:20.390 --> 18:21.642
{\an1}We acknowledge the wrongdoing,
and we repair it.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.685
{\an1}So you think about reading,
right, and a lot of black people

18:23.769 --> 18:25.354
{\an1}don't come from a legacy of
reading,

18:25.437 --> 18:26.814
{\an1}not because we didn't want to
read but because we weren't

18:26.897 --> 18:28.857
allowed to read over history...
- And 'cause it ain't fun.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.735
- And because it can be fun.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.655
- Not funner than movies.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.406
- When we think about
reparations--

18:36.490 --> 18:37.491
- Name a book funner than a
movie.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.368
- "Harry Potter."
- So you'd rather go to--

18:39.451 --> 18:40.702
- Have you read the books?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.204
{\an3}- You'd rather go to
Universal...

18:42.287 --> 18:43.580
- Have you read them?
- And read the book

18:43.664 --> 18:45.707
instead of getting on the ride?
- Have you read them?

18:45.791 --> 18:46.333
{\an3}- Did you see the movie?
Yes or no?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.210
- I did see the movie.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.212
- So how do I know
you really read the book?

18:50.295 --> 18:52.047
{\an1}- But the movies came out
years after the--the books did.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.215
- So when you had that book,
just walking around like "Yo,

18:53.298 --> 18:54.633
straight up, Harry Potter"?

18:54.716 --> 18:56.552
{\an1}- Yes.
Me and half the world, yes.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.761
- What were you saying, DeRay,
about we were on reparations...

18:57.845 --> 18:59.429
both: Reparations.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.556
- What reparations could
look like would be like,

19:00.639 --> 19:02.891
"What would it look like to give
every single kid

19:02.975 --> 19:04.226
{\an1}"in a low-income community a
library for every year

19:04.309 --> 19:05.978
{\an1}until they get to
12th grade, right?"

19:06.061 --> 19:07.563
That would be an idea of,
like, a correction.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.897
- But you've got to want to.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.566
End of the day, regardless of
what you're giving,

19:10.649 --> 19:14.945
library, whatever, people gotta
want to go to the library.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.906
{\an3}Just receiving something is not
receiving reparation,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.825
{\an3}When you look out your window,
and if all you see

19:19.908 --> 19:21.660
{\an3}is a drug dealer with a dope
car,

19:21.743 --> 19:23.453
{\an3}that's what you want at the
moment,

19:23.537 --> 19:25.622
{\an3}so that's your library;
that's what you want to read.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.250
Oh, damn,
I just got smart out of nowhere.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.336
{\an3}- Why is it that
everybody got together

19:31.420 --> 19:33.088
for the women's protest?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.840
- Yo, bro, bro, bro--
- But--but--but when--

19:34.923 --> 19:36.758
but when the--I'm hot right now;
I'm heating up.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.261
{\an3}- I know, but the Women's March,
it was some girls down there.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.805
- No, I know. All the--
all the girls showed up.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.390
{\an3}- Bro, I was,
I was gonna go for that.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.975
{\an3}- But why don't--why don't
people show up

19:45.058 --> 19:48.103
{\an3}the same way for
black-centered protests?

19:48.186 --> 19:50.522
- Yeah,
I think that this is--

19:50.606 --> 19:51.857
I mean, it's what we
saw over the past two years.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.442
Two years ago, we were vilified
for being in the street.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.862
Now it's like protesting is this
magical, mythical thing

19:56.945 --> 19:58.405
that people praise every day.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.656
{\an1}But I'm excited
about the energy, though.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.825
{\an1}The Women's March was incredible
all across the country.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.826
So many people came outside--
- Lit.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.494
- So fine.
- Lit.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.996
- Stop it.
- The other day you taught me

20:06.079 --> 20:08.665
the proper...

20:08.749 --> 20:10.459
- There's no one way to protest.
- What's your way?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.461
{\an3}- Man, I got a lot of
different ways to do it, though.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.253
{\an3}- What's your
"power of the people" sign?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.380
- It's up a little higher.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.757
{\an3}It's like, "Yo, where it gotta
be at."

20:16.840 --> 20:18.800
{\an1}- Right here. It's gotta be at
a angle where you could still...

20:18.884 --> 20:19.927
- Strike.
- Knock the [BLEEP] out.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.971
- Preferably not a [BLEEP].

20:23.055 --> 20:26.600
[bell dings]

20:26.683 --> 20:27.976
- Hey,
thanks for tuning in, y'all.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.145
That's the episode.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.273
Now y'all do whatever y'all do
when this 1/2 hour block ends.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.735
Come back next week, though.
We lit.
