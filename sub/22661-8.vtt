WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.771
Come on, guys,
we're gonna be late for school.

00:03.804 --> 00:05.639
We don't have school.

00:05.673 --> 00:09.543
No, no, no, I'm not
falling for that again.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.679
No, it's for real.
It's Teacher Reading Day.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.147
They sent home a note.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.516
What note?
I didn't see any note.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.286
Teddy, did you start
eating paper again?

00:19.553 --> 00:21.722
Well, I found the note.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.692
And the upstairs remote. Teddy!

00:25.726 --> 00:28.562
We both have to work.
What are we gonna do?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.231
Katie can babysit.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.100
Yes! I knew there was
a reason we had three.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.667
Yeah.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.203
Sorry, no day off
for high school.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.205
You know, I can't wait
to go to college

00:37.238 --> 00:38.739
and skip class all the time.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.743
She's gonna be trouble.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.517
You know, the
teachers are there.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.519
What if we just drop
these two at school

00:51.552 --> 00:53.854
and act like
we didn't know?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.756
The trick is to
drive away fast.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.691
I have an idea.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.762
You guys are going to work
with Daddy today!

01:01.795 --> 01:03.631
Yay!

01:03.664 --> 01:05.099
No, no yay.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.335
No, I can't take them.
I have to work.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.836
Well, I have to work, too.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.771
So what
are we gonna do?

01:10.804 --> 01:14.308
Guess we're just gonna have to
sit down and talk it out.

01:14.342 --> 01:17.811
Aw, I always lose
when we do that!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.780
Oh, how about this?

01:19.813 --> 01:21.749
A race to the
door, okay?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.784
Last one out stays
home, all right?

01:23.817 --> 01:24.785
On three.
Okay, come on.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.521
One, two...

01:27.555 --> 01:30.858
Thought I could hurdle that
coffee table, I really did.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.195
Okay, why can't you
take the kids today?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.230
I have a meeting with
the mini-mall developer.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.132
And she's already
bent out of shape because

01:38.166 --> 01:40.668
there's a trucker's strike
and construction is delayed.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.471
Okay, well, no rational person
can blame you for that.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.906
She's not rational.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.841
She fired her own mother.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.477
Well, I can't take them either.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.878
My boss is out for the morning,

01:50.911 --> 01:52.846
and he just made me
his number two.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.885
Hey, you know, a promotion
like that deserves a reward.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.920
Congratulations, honey,
you just won a day at home

01:59.953 --> 02:01.789
with our beautiful children.

02:01.822 --> 02:06.126
Oh. So I have to stay home
because I'm a woman?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.930
:
Okay.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.932
Didn't know you'd
play that card this early.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.535
Hey, if I'm holding an ace,
you're gonna see it.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.273
There's no good
solution to this.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.809
I don't understand why kids
can't stay home alone.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.911
Remember that movie, Home Alone?

02:23.944 --> 02:24.945
Huh?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.680
That was a big hit.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.249
You know,

02:28.282 --> 02:29.917
when I was Teddy's age,
my parents would just

02:29.950 --> 02:32.486
leave Don and I with a sign
around our necks that said,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.456
"If found, please return
to 247 Maple Street."

02:35.489 --> 02:38.492
Is that true?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.394
Just let me tell my story.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.598
All this babying
is not good for the kids.

02:44.632 --> 02:48.168
You know, we...
we cut up their bananas.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.904
Bananas, Andi!

02:50.938 --> 02:54.174
A monkey knows
how to work a banana.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.279
If we keep this up, when the
kids get out in the real world,

02:58.312 --> 02:59.913
they are never gonna survive.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.215
Okay, okay.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.217
You know what?
This weekend,

03:03.251 --> 03:05.219
we will drive the kids
out to the woods,

03:05.253 --> 03:08.589
give them a banana and see
who makes it home. Huh?

03:08.622 --> 03:10.891
But for now, take them to work.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.794
I knew I'd lose
if we talked it out.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.096
Fine, I'll take them.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.866
But we are definitely doing
that banana Hunger Games thing.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.871
I'll tell you what, when my boss
gets back this afternoon,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.839
I'll-I'll fake a lady problem

03:25.873 --> 03:27.841
and I'll come take
Teddy and Emme from you.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.744
Yes. Men don't ask questions
about lady problems

03:30.778 --> 03:32.613
'cause we don't
want the answers.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.951
Teddy, Teddy,
don't-don't touch that.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.820
Don't touch that, okay?
All right.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.555
Emme, Emme, Emme,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.557
Honey, that's-that's
my boss's chair, okay?

03:43.591 --> 03:45.293
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.994
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

03:47.027 --> 03:47.795
Give me that.
Give me that.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.997
Stop playing-- No.
Will you stop it?

03:50.030 --> 03:52.766
Stop. Stop it. Stop it!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.802
Lisa!

03:54.835 --> 03:58.939
Oh, look, you brought
your children to my workplace.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.343
I'd just like to point out that
I didn't bring any kids.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.546
Good, Don. Very good.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.014
Now, why don't you
and the little ones

04:07.047 --> 04:09.883
celebrate your victory
by going out into the hall.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.951
That's a good idea.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.986
Why don't you guys
wait for Daddy outside. Okay.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.655
Really? Are you sure
you want me to...

04:14.688 --> 04:16.023
Yep, uh-huh.
Now you're doing it.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.025
Okay.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.693
Uh, sorry about that.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.329
There was a scheduling thing
with school,

04:21.362 --> 04:22.896
and my wife is very liberated.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.932
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
It's best if I don't know

04:24.965 --> 04:26.567
too much about
your personal life.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.337
It'll make it easier
if/when things go south

04:29.370 --> 04:31.705
with the mini-mall, and
I have to, you know...

04:33.607 --> 04:35.509
Kill me?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.077
No, fire you.

04:37.110 --> 04:37.945
Oh.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.613
Although my therapist
would tell me

04:39.647 --> 04:41.048
to be more sympathetic.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.383
Your therapist
sounds very smart.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.885
I fired her.
Serves that idiot right.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.087
Uh, we have to make this
a quick meeting.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.789
The Developers Association

04:48.822 --> 04:51.091
is honoring me
with an Innovator Award,

04:51.124 --> 04:54.094
and I'm a little frightened
of public speaking.
Oh.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.896
I'm much more likeable
one-on-one.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.731
Sure. Yeah.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.868
I say that because I don't want
you to...

05:00.901 --> 05:02.970
What is that?

05:03.003 --> 05:04.672
I was just doing what you did.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.374
You don't do that.
I do that.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.475
Okay.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.377
Let's talk about
why you're here.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.045
I am not happy about
the delays on the mini-mall.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.615
Lisa, this truckers' strike
is causing problems.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.017
If it helps,
I have 20 other contractors

05:17.050 --> 05:19.119
that can replace
you guys by tomorrow.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.623
I wouldn't call it
super helpful.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.092
Look, we will bring
this thing in on time, okay?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.795
The Burns brothers are
as professional as it gets.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.663
Hey, random question.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.566
Was that vase
out here expensive?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.002
The kids broke the vase?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.971
Right. Yeah, the kids.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.608
But don't ask them about it;
they'll just lie.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.879
*

05:59.059 --> 06:01.795
Whoa, what's
going on here?

06:01.829 --> 06:03.831
I have bugs on my head.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.768
Welcome home, honey.
The kids have lice.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.071
Would you stop telling
everybody about that?

06:11.104 --> 06:15.409
He's your dad.
You've pooped in his hand.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.811
Stop telling everybody
about that!

06:19.647 --> 06:20.481
How can we have lice again?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.149
I thought you could
only get that once.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.852
No, that's mono.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.689
And somehow I've taken that
around the block a few times.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.525
Lowell was kind enough
to come and treat everybody.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.527
Actually, I told Andi it's easy
and she could do it,

06:33.561 --> 06:35.929
and she said, "Oh, I have to
do it because I'm a woman?"

06:35.963 --> 06:36.964
And I came right over.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.002
Wow, you are milking that
like a dairy cow.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.204
It's no big deal.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.507
I had the supplies because
I just treated my kids.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.175
Apparently,
the whole school has it.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.178
Well, why wouldn't
they tell us that?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.648
Wait a minute.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.853
Here it is.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.221
Teddy!

07:01.254 --> 07:03.524
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.727
You're not the messenger.
You never deliver the message!

07:07.628 --> 07:09.597
Okay, guys, you're done.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.065
Go upstairs and rinse the little
dead bodies out of your hair.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.201
Ugh.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.069
Just talking about
these bugs makes me itchy.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.472
Actually, um, you guys
should get checked.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.874
Oh, and we have to
tell your dad, too.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.644
He took the kids to that
ball pit place yesterday.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.646
You should let
them know, too.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.115
Hey, if you go to a ball pit
and all you catch is lice,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.918
you dodged a bullet.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.053
The kids' feet don't reach
the bottom, but mine did.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.222
It's wet down there.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.224
Okay, Don's clean.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.593
Yeah, they couldn't make
it up to the penthouse.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.263
But Adam's got
some friends on top.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.565
:
Oh.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.667
I can't believe this.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.968
Honey, it's okay.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.137
It just means you're
a loving, affectionate dad.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.240
And Don's a cold, distant uncle.

07:53.273 --> 07:57.244
You're gonna have to notify
everybody you were with today.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.980
Well, we weren't with
anyone except each other.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.183
Oh!

08:03.216 --> 08:05.218
*

08:10.157 --> 08:12.726
Adam, are

08:12.760 --> 08:15.228
The kids were all over
Lisa's office.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.897
They probably gave her lice!

08:18.699 --> 08:20.901
If we left them home
with signs around their necks,

08:20.934 --> 08:22.936
this never would've happened.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.740
I-I'm sure she'll understand.
I mean, she's probably got kids.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.109
The only way she has kids
is if she lured them

08:29.142 --> 08:31.078
into her candy house
to eat them for dinner.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.084
Listen, we got to
get out in front

08:37.117 --> 08:38.719
of this lice
thing with Lisa.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.154
Okay, we gave up all of
our other work for this job.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.223
We got expenses,
we hired Lowell.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.725
You guys better
fix this.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.627
I can't go back
to being a house-husband.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.062
My father-in-law
just stopped calling me Nancy.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.300
Wow, Nancy's worried.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.705
Okay, all right, uh...
Oh, how about this?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.139
Lisa's got that
awards banquet tonight.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.908
Let's just go down there
and check her out.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.275
No, no. I'm mad at her.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.678
She put me out in the hall
with the kids.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.146
No, no, Don.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.281
We'll just hang back
and see if she's scratching.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.050
If she's not, then we're just

09:10.083 --> 09:12.319
a couple of business partners
there to support her.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.821
That's nice of us.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.822
Yeah. Yeah.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.990
And if she does have lice,
we'll come clean.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.793
Hopefully, she'll appreciate our
honesty and not send us packing.

09:19.827 --> 09:23.363
Wait, wait, you're betting
our jobs on her humanity?

09:23.396 --> 09:24.998
Yep. And it's
a high-risk move

09:25.032 --> 09:27.267
'cause I'm not
convinced she's human.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.570
I'm pretty sure I saw a zipper
on the back of her head.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.343
I better have all my hair
when you wash this stuff out.

09:36.376 --> 09:40.380
My inventory's
running low already.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.651
All right, we're heading down
to Lisa's awards banquet.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.753
No big deal,
just trying to save our jobs.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.988
Oh, I'm sure
you'll do great.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.157
Don, let Adam
do all the talking.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.358
Right. I'll just be eye candy.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.729
Joe, I'm really sorry
the kids turned your head

09:55.763 --> 09:57.397
into a bug motel.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.834
You know, Bev's
probably got them, too,

10:00.868 --> 10:03.236
and she's on a river
cruise with her gal pals.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.106
A boat full of itchy women
scratching together.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.741
Huh.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.677
That-that makes me chuckle.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.279
Okay, let's check you out.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.748
Okay, well, get ready,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.850
'cause last time
the kids gave them to me,

10:16.884 --> 10:20.954
it was like the
million lice march on my head.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.190
I guess that's just the curse of
being an affectionate mother.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.759
Nope. You're clean as a whistle.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.361
Huh?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.197
No, no, no, that-that
can't be right, Lowell.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.198
Ch-Check it again.

10:31.231 --> 10:35.368
I checked. You're good.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.806
:
Okay.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.074
Listen to me very carefully,
all right?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.776
I'm their mother. Right?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.412
Every time they get the flu,
I get the flu.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.681
When they had strep throat,
I had strep throat.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.817
And the last time
they got these bugs,

10:49.850 --> 10:52.953
I got hit the worst because
I am a warm and loving mother!

10:52.986 --> 10:55.422
Okay, don't beat yourself up.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.124
You can't compare then to now.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.092
I mean, these days,
you're busy working.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.132
What... what are you
implying, Lowell?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.967
Don't engage.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.070
No, I'm not implying anything.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.339
I'm just pointing out
a factual difference.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.406
Stand down, boy.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.846
I think you're saying
that I don't have lice

11:18.879 --> 11:20.881
because I'm not around enough.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.217
No, no, I did not
mean that at all.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.853
What do I do?

11:25.886 --> 11:29.056
Play dead and
hope she moves on.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.926
Okay, look, there could be
lots of reasons for this.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.797
Like here-- it says lice are
only attracted to clean hair.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.970
So I'm either an absent mom
or a dirty one.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.941
Maybe you're both.
Who says you can't have it all?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.746
Wow, look at this spread.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.882
They got the giant
shrimp and tiny pickles.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.183
The whole world's
upside down.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.286
Will you stay focused?
We have a job to do.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.755
Ooh, they got the olives with
a red thing in the middle.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.791
How they do that?

12:03.824 --> 12:06.827
Go to a grocery store, man.
That's just regular stuff.

12:06.860 --> 12:11.098
All right, now use your
freakish height to find Lisa.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.432
There she is.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.069
Ladies and gentlemen,
our Innovator Award winner,

12:16.103 --> 12:18.071
Lisa McCaffrey.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.445
Uh-oh.
She's scratching her head.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.080
Hold on, hold on.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.183
Maybe she's just
coming up with an idea.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.520
This is... such an honor.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.490
Must be a real brainstorm.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.159
Okay.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.069
Oh, my God.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.205
We just turned our boss
into the Bride of Frankenstein.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.177
Now, where was I?

13:04.584 --> 13:06.253
Don, we're screwed.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.255
We gave our boss lice,
and she just humiliated herself.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.223
She sees us.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.424
Just look away.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.260
I can't; her
hair's too funny.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.130
What are we gonna do?
I thought we had to tell her.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.465
No, no, no, it's too big.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.400
Remember when we were kids,
we shot that bottle rocket

13:20.433 --> 13:22.302
into the woods and
all the trees caught on fire?

13:22.335 --> 13:24.604
We didn't tell anyone, we just
got the hell out of there.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.574
Everything's on fire, Don!
Let's get the hell out of here!

13:27.607 --> 13:29.209
You're right, let's go.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.115
What kind of frickin' lice
don't get on the mother's head?

13:38.085 --> 13:40.420
She's upset. One of us is
gonna have to go in there.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.421
You go.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.489
You're related to her.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.392
Not by blood, so let's just
take that off the table.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.328
You know what this is?

13:48.361 --> 13:52.299
This-this is society trying
to keep the working moms down!

13:52.332 --> 13:53.867
I'm out.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.036
What? Don't leave me.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.039
Hey, you pulled the pin
on the grenade; you jump on it.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.107
Feel better, honey!

14:12.619 --> 14:16.023
So... you know
what I was thinking?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.391
I bet that you don't have lice

14:18.425 --> 14:21.161
because they just
flew off your head

14:21.194 --> 14:24.965
while you were running around
being a great mom.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.934
Nice try, Lowell,
but I think we both know

14:26.967 --> 14:28.035
why I don't have the bugs.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.104
There could be
other reasons.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.440
Like, did you put your head
too close to the microwave?

14:34.975 --> 14:39.079
Were you underwater
for 45 minutes?

14:39.112 --> 14:41.281
Have you been in space?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.616
Are you having fun, Lowell?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.286
No.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.958
And not that I'm ready to go,
but have you seen my car keys?

14:50.991 --> 14:55.162
Wait. Is this
your hair spray?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.630
No, I stole it.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.599
Among my many flaws,
I'm also a kleptomaniac.

14:59.632 --> 15:04.004
I guess once you light the fuse,
all the bombs go off.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.205
I'm just saying,

15:05.238 --> 15:08.241
your hair spray
has tea tree oil in it.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.343
That repels lice.
It does?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.912
Look, it's on the sheet
from school.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.218
So it's not my fault?

15:18.251 --> 15:21.521
I am a good mother.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.191
Great mother.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.127
Little bit of
an aggressive host.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.396
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here
while you're smiling.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.697
Thanks so much, Lowell.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.932
Anytime. But never again.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.736
Hey, Lowell.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.538
There's my handsome man.
How'd it go?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.107
I don't want to tell you

15:40.140 --> 15:43.210
because you look like
you're in a good mood.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.344
She is now.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.214
Thanks for meeting me at
the exit of the roller coaster.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.419
ADAM:
Wait a minute.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.056
You thought you were a bad mom
because you didn't have lice?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.591
Yeah, I felt terrible.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.395
So I did the healthy thing
and I took it out on Lowell.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.298
Well, I don't hate that someone
else took that shrapnel.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.036
I mean, I actually thought
about quitting my job.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.504
I can't believe you were
beating yourself up like that.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.306
And there's no way
you're quitting.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.042
After Lisa's speech tonight,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.310
you might be
the only one of us working.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.146
Was it really that bad?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.314
Yeah, yeah.
She's got a bundle of lice,

16:21.348 --> 16:23.516
and she's gonna realize
it was because of us.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.785
We have until Monday
to figure our way out of this.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.789
Who is it?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.258
LISA:
It's Lisa McCaffrey!

16:32.492 --> 16:35.162
Don, she's at my house.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.163
She knows!

16:36.196 --> 16:37.164
Turn off the lights.

16:38.765 --> 16:42.069
Oh! Andi, you talk to her.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.171
Oh, I have to talk to her
because I'm a woman?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.273
Yes! I'm playing the card now.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.075
The card works both ways.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.309
LISA:
Hello?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.578
I know you're in there.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.114
You know what?
This seems like man's work.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.448
Yeah, I'm reverse
playing the card.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.292
Lisa. Hey, what's up?

17:05.325 --> 17:08.095
So, my speech didn't
go very well tonight,

17:08.128 --> 17:09.729
and we need to talk about it.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.598
Uh, look, I just want
to say I'm sorry...

17:11.631 --> 17:13.566
I had an anxiety attack.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.302
Or you go.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.238
I called my therapist,
Dr. Klein,

17:18.271 --> 17:20.207
and she explained
that the itching was

17:20.240 --> 17:23.276
a physical manifestation
of my fear of public speaking.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.747
That sounds about right.
She nailed it.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.451
I just came by
because we work together,

17:31.484 --> 17:34.654
and I felt I owed you
an explanation.

17:34.687 --> 17:38.358
Well, just don't
let it happen again.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.395
Bottom line:

17:42.429 --> 17:44.764
what happened on that stage
tonight was my fault.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.299
It was my failure,

17:46.333 --> 17:49.236
and I have to figure out
a way to deal with that.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.207
No. Don't you do it.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.508
Don't you do
the right thing.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.345
Lisa! Lisa! Wait, wait.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.647
Oh, he's doing it.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.316
Yeah, c-come on in.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.452
Um...

18:05.485 --> 18:09.456
What happened tonight--
the problem's not in your head,

18:09.489 --> 18:12.525
it's on your head.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.894
What are you saying?

18:14.927 --> 18:18.298
Well, you see...

18:18.331 --> 18:21.568
Don's niece and
nephew gave you lice.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.774
You let me make a fool
out of myself

18:27.807 --> 18:29.476
in front of my entire industry.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.778
I should fire you right now.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.414
Hey, you know what?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.649
My wife has a job, okay?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.652
So sometimes I have to bring
my kids to work,

18:39.686 --> 18:42.755
and almost every time, they have
something you can catch.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.359
And I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.596
I will.
I'm sorry for both of us.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.599
No, no, no. I'm tired of
everyone feeling bad.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.302
My wife felt bad because she
thought she was a bad mom.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.404
I felt bad because
I thought I was a bad employee.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.771
We're all doing
the best we can,

18:58.805 --> 19:00.473
and if that's not
good enough for you,

19:00.507 --> 19:02.642
then you know what,
go ahead, fire us, go ahead.

19:02.675 --> 19:06.746
Well, you really took
the wind out of my sails.

19:06.779 --> 19:10.317
If you don't mind getting fired,
it's not fun for me.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.320
I'd like to be
fired, too, then.

19:15.488 --> 19:20.427
Look, if it means anything,
we never meant for it to happen.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.697
Well, I guess the lice
is a bit of a relief.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.234
I can fix that with shampoo.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.937
I thought I was gonna
have to improve myself.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.705
Good luck, am I right?

19:33.873 --> 19:36.543
Okay, uh, are we still
working for you?

19:36.576 --> 19:39.546
Sure. For now.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.450
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
call my therapist,

19:43.483 --> 19:45.385
Dr. Klein, and fire her.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.754
And then I'm gonna swing by
my ex-husband's house

19:47.787 --> 19:51.858
and give his new girlfriend
a big licey hug.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.561
That sounds fun.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.696
Maybe don't lose
Dr. Klein's number.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.303
That was good stuff.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.971
I was worried,
but you landed that plane.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.508
ANDI:
Hey, honey.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.743
I heard everything.
I'm so proud of you.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.412
You've earned these.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.580
Oh.
Oh.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.914
I meant what I said.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.949
If I have to take my kids
to work every day,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.451
then I am happy to do it.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.753
Oh, good.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.889
'Cause I just got an e-mail.
They're fumigating the school,

20:22.922 --> 20:25.458
and the kids are gonna be off
for the next three days.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.362
I'm calling in
with lady problems.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.739
TV REPORTER: And in other news,
a river boat was quarantined

20:39.772 --> 20:41.841
offshore due to a lice outbreak.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.583
Never tell your mother
how much I enjoyed this.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.785
You want us to rewind it
and play it again?

20:52.819 --> 20:54.020
He's seen it
three times.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.855
Once more for the old man, huh?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.791
And in other news, a river boat
was quarantined...
