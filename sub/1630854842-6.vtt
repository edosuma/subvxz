WEBVTT

00:21.416 --> 00:23.291
-Front…
-No, don't worry…

00:26.416 --> 00:27.375
Slowly.

00:33.916 --> 00:35.291
It's a Mughal dagger.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.416
-Indian, 16th century.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.041
They come in pairs, so if we find
the other one, we find who killed Carver.

00:41.125 --> 00:45.041
No. You've had your shot.
You made yourselves too conspicuous.

00:45.125 --> 00:48.708
Bickerstaff's mirror, the bone glass,
it's Fittes' business now.

00:48.791 --> 00:51.166
-You can't be serious.
-But they'll screw it up.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.000
-It'll get into the wrong hands.
-Not your problem anymore.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.583
I mean, look around.

00:56.083 --> 00:58.791
-You've got no safeguards, no supervision.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.916
And I don't have the time or resources
to protect you.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.666
-Inspector, I know you don't like us--
-I never said--

01:04.750 --> 01:07.500
Or our methods, and that's fine.
But they work.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.083
We found Annabel Ward's murderer.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.458
No one else knows that, but you do.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.208
Come on, we're good.

01:14.708 --> 01:19.041
Now, I'm begging you, just give us
this chance to find the mirror.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.666
What about you, Carlyle?

01:24.541 --> 01:25.791
You're unusually quiet.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.125
I think we should finish the job.
We're better placed than anyone else.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.291
It's our choice, and we know the risks.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.458
You should let us.

01:41.458 --> 01:42.291
Fine.

01:43.791 --> 01:45.166
But I'm not asking you,

01:45.750 --> 01:46.750
I'm telling you,

01:47.458 --> 01:48.958
be smart.

01:49.041 --> 01:52.708
You're dealing with real-life criminals
here. Flesh and blood.

01:52.791 --> 01:54.958
So you stick to the psychical side.

01:55.041 --> 01:56.625
Locate the bone glass.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.541
-Leave the rest to DEPRAC.

01:58.625 --> 02:01.625
-Sir? Critical incident in Kilburn.

02:03.708 --> 02:06.291
<i>Let all units know</i>
<i>when they're ready…</i>

02:06.375 --> 02:09.208
Don't let this be the last time
I see the three of you alive.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.625
Am I doing the right thing?

02:17.125 --> 02:19.375
You warned them. What else can you do?

02:20.166 --> 02:21.875
They're the ones with the talent.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.208
Yeah.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.541
Poor sods.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.291
I should catch you guys up
on my Bickerstaff research.

04:04.791 --> 04:06.083
What happened to the window?

04:06.583 --> 04:08.625
Oh… A bird flew into it.

04:09.291 --> 04:13.583
So it turns out he was a highly respected
clinician, psychiatrist,

04:13.666 --> 04:15.250
a pioneer of new techniques.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.833
He held secret gatherings
in his house in Hampstead,

04:17.916 --> 04:21.208
and they would have remained secret, too,
if it wasn't for Mary Dulac.

04:21.291 --> 04:23.958
-Who's Mary Dulac?
-She's a guest that went missing.

04:24.041 --> 04:26.583
Vanished into thin air
after attending one of his meetings.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.125
But here's the weirdest thing.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.583
She turned up again ten years later
out of the blue,

04:30.666 --> 04:32.333
but she'd gone completely mad.

04:32.416 --> 04:35.250
-Because of the bone glass?
-That would make sense, wouldn't it?

04:35.333 --> 04:38.250
But why does everyone want it so badly?
What can it do?

04:38.333 --> 04:40.750
Apart from drive you mad and kill you?

04:40.833 --> 04:43.333
I think it's more
than just a dangerous relic.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.208
I think it's something completely unique.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.541
Oh, well done.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.333
Finally, you're waking up.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.958
Lucy, what's the matter?

04:55.458 --> 04:56.625
It's speaking.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.541
What do you mean, "waking up"?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.875
Took you long enough, didn't it?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.333
Lucy, what's going on?

05:08.833 --> 05:10.250
It's talking to her.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.875
If you know so much,
why don't you help us?

05:13.958 --> 05:16.416
I'm a mere acolyte.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.958
My master has the answers.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.541
Your master?

05:24.708 --> 05:26.041
That's what you meant.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.291
You know Bickerstaff!

05:29.375 --> 05:31.750
I knew he'd return
to finish his work.

05:31.833 --> 05:35.250
My master's power cannot stay buried.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.291
What is the bone glass? What does it do?

05:38.375 --> 05:41.083
-Take me, and I'll show you.
-Take you where?

05:41.166 --> 05:43.583
My master's house.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.166
Why?

05:46.833 --> 05:50.041
-What will we find there?
-Everything you need to know.

05:51.791 --> 05:55.125
But I'll need something in return.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.208
I knew there was something special
when I stole that skull.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.916
After I started my experiments,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.375
it was only a matter of time
before it did something amazing.

06:06.083 --> 06:09.291
-Well done, me.
-Yeah, thank God for you, George.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.916
You realize we're making history here?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.500
-You're not allowed to tell anyone.
-Oh, but your asset value has rocketed.

06:16.416 --> 06:19.541
-How about a little press conference?
-Hilarious.

06:20.291 --> 06:23.625
-I'm just glad you finally believe me.
-I'm a man of science.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.833
Can't believe anything without evidence.

06:28.541 --> 06:29.583
What are we gonna do?

06:30.916 --> 06:32.458
About it wanting to be set free?

06:33.750 --> 06:35.333
Well, we keep it onside.

06:35.416 --> 06:38.916
Let it lead us to whatever's hidden at
Bickerstaff's, then we decide what to do.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.541
Lucy will decide.
There's no pressure from us. Or the skull.

06:43.666 --> 06:46.250
This is a game changer for us,
if you can harness this thing.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.541
-Do you think you can?
-Guess we'll find out.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.666
If only eight-year-old George Karim
could see me now.

06:51.750 --> 06:55.666
The best experiment yet.
Fully testing out a Type Three.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.041
And me.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.208
You'll be fine.

07:01.791 --> 07:02.833
We've got your back.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.000
Ready?

07:50.458 --> 07:52.500
How did
the skull know Bickerstaff?

07:52.583 --> 07:55.333
He said he was his acolyte.
Calls him "master."

07:55.416 --> 07:58.208
Accomplice
to an occultist doctor. Bodes well.

08:14.750 --> 08:15.708
-No!
-Wait.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.250
-Stop here.
-Hang on.

08:17.833 --> 08:18.750
What is it?

08:18.833 --> 08:21.416
Do not step inside. Wait here.

08:22.083 --> 08:26.333
-Let Lockwood and Karim go.
-Why?

08:26.416 --> 08:29.041
Because they can't talk to me,
and you can.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.541
They're expendable.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.375
If you die,
I'll be trapped in this jar forever.

08:36.791 --> 08:38.208
-Lucy?
-Wait.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.916
I'm in charge now.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.666
The boy Karim has felt
the power of the bone glass.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.625
Let him have what he craves.

08:44.708 --> 08:48.750
Lucy, you have to tell us what
it's saying. You can't just… blank us.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.875
You two need to wait here. I'm going in.

08:51.916 --> 08:54.750
-Absolutely not.
-Lucy, you're not going in there alone.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.166
I'm not alone, am I?

08:56.250 --> 08:58.166
You have to trust me.

08:58.250 --> 09:01.541
If we're not back in 15 minutes,
then you guys can come in.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.291
-You said I get to decide.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.250
So I am in charge.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.000
This is my decision.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.250
Foolish girl.

09:31.625 --> 09:32.666
Home.

09:33.291 --> 09:34.958
Hmm. Very cozy.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.958
Now, our bargain.
Open the lid. Let me out.

09:39.833 --> 09:40.666
No.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.958
We had an agreement. Let me out!

09:44.041 --> 09:46.125
We haven't found what we're looking for.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.958
You haven't told me
what we're looking for.

09:48.041 --> 09:51.875
-His papers! I'll guide you.
-You can do that fine from in there.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.000
Now, just tell me where to look.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.750
Where does your master
keep his secrets?

09:57.250 --> 09:59.125
Behind a closed door.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.791
What do you sense?

10:18.666 --> 10:19.708
Traces…

10:20.625 --> 10:22.041
-…of cigars.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.000
-Drinking.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.625
Men.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.875
-The dining room.

10:29.416 --> 10:30.375
Open it.

10:43.958 --> 10:45.041
What is that?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.416
That's not a dining table.

10:49.708 --> 10:50.833
That's some sort of…

10:52.041 --> 10:53.625
operating table.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.375
-Sounds like…

10:59.458 --> 11:00.750
…something being…

11:02.291 --> 11:03.750
sawed.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.541
Blood dripping.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.916
I thought he was a shrink.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.000
Not a surgeon.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.083
He was a genius.

11:17.666 --> 11:18.750
A visionary.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.208
Let's just get what we came for
and get out of here.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.333
Let me out, and I'll show you.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.791
Show me, and I'll let you out.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.333
You need me alive, remember?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.291
So start talking, <i>now.</i>

11:34.291 --> 11:35.708
Look closer.

11:35.791 --> 11:39.125
Three spouts are for blood. The other is…

11:41.916 --> 11:42.916
A switch.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.833
Hours ago, I thought this was
the best thing to ever happen to us.

11:59.916 --> 12:02.333
-Now it could be the worst.
-I know what you mean.

12:02.416 --> 12:05.416
She said, "Give <i>us</i> 15 minutes
and if <i>we're </i>not back…"

12:05.500 --> 12:07.625
She's talking about it
like they're a team!

12:08.125 --> 12:09.625
It's still technically mine.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.625
It was never yours, technically.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.291
How long now?

12:14.291 --> 12:15.125
Ten minutes.

12:15.708 --> 12:18.666
Look, she's not in charge here.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.333
Who knows what that thing
could be whispering in her ear?

12:21.416 --> 12:23.125
Have you forgotten Annabel Ward?

12:24.041 --> 12:25.208
Let me put it this way.

12:25.291 --> 12:28.875
We've just sent her alone
into a severely haunted house.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.291
You're right. This is insane.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.208
What's that?

13:24.333 --> 13:26.041
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:26.708 --> 13:27.583
No.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.833
How do we know
which way she went?

13:31.916 --> 13:32.791
We don't.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.541
-What was that?
-Something senses you.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.083
There's not much time. Search the desk.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.333
Come on, come on, come on.

14:26.416 --> 14:29.708
-What's even in these papers anyway?
-Not there. Keep looking!

14:29.791 --> 14:32.333
-Shit.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.083
That's it. Keep them safe.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.583
-Quickly, Lucy, they're coming!

14:51.416 --> 14:52.750
-Lucy!
-Let's go!

14:55.625 --> 14:56.458
Too late.

14:58.916 --> 15:01.541
-Why do they sound like that?
-Their final breaths.

15:02.541 --> 15:03.666
Wait.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.083
They were his patients.

15:08.416 --> 15:09.666
He killed them.

15:10.541 --> 15:11.375
Lucy!

15:12.083 --> 15:12.958
Where are you?

15:13.708 --> 15:15.375
Lucy, answer us!

15:15.458 --> 15:17.791
-Time to let me out, Lucy.

15:20.958 --> 15:21.958
George!

15:22.041 --> 15:23.458
He can't help you now.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.708
But I can. Free me!

15:25.791 --> 15:27.875
Lockwood! Please!

15:30.000 --> 15:31.875
Lockwood! George!

15:33.583 --> 15:35.625
Lockwood, please!

15:35.708 --> 15:36.791
Lucy!

15:38.875 --> 15:40.416
Release me!

15:43.083 --> 15:45.041
George, it's a trapdoor!

15:48.916 --> 15:51.333
Don't force it.
There'll be some kind of trigger.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.833
Lucy, we're here. We're coming.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.875
-You fool. You've ruined us!

15:58.583 --> 15:59.708
You knew!

15:59.791 --> 16:00.708
Lockwood!

16:01.208 --> 16:02.666
Lockwood, I think this is it!

16:04.750 --> 16:06.333
-You try that one.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.583
-Lucy, we're coming!
-Hang on, Lucy!

16:28.666 --> 16:31.791
-What the hell happened back there?
-He was a monster.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.375
-Hey.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.750
Hey, it's okay. We've got you now.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.708
You're safe now, okay? You're with us.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.958
That's the last time
you go and do a job on your own.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.958
I don't care what the skull says.
We're your team.

16:50.541 --> 16:51.541
Not him.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.750
Did you find anything?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.041
Yeah.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.541
You're incredible.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.583
Okay if I dive
into Bickerstaff's papers?

17:06.666 --> 17:07.541
Go for it.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.791
-You okay?
-Hmm.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.125
Need anything?

17:14.750 --> 17:15.750
I'm fine. I just…

17:16.958 --> 17:19.708
I need to put him away for a bit.
He can't be trusted.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.333
-Morning, Locky.
-Still got your old key, then?

17:46.416 --> 17:47.500
Never throw away a key.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.916
Every single one
unlocks something somewhere.

17:50.875 --> 17:54.291
You're always welcome
to put your feet up here. You know that.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.916
Very kind of you, Locky. Love what you've
done with the place, by the way.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.000
Oh, I haven't touched it.

18:01.083 --> 18:01.916
Exactly.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.208
I thought you might have
changed a few things up at least.

18:05.708 --> 18:08.625
Like have you found another use
for that room on the landing yet?

18:09.708 --> 18:10.708
No.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.208
Can't avoid it forever, Locky.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.083
I know.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.541
Right. I didn't come here
for an intervention.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.375
I heard Carver got your message.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.750
Walked through the door
with a knife in his back.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.250
-Do you think Winkman did it?
-Wouldn't surprise me.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.875
If you need somewhere to hide, I know
a lovely houseboat by Eel Pie Island.

18:29.958 --> 18:33.083
It's tempting.
We're still trying to find that mirror.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.583
Heard anything?
Has Winkman tried to sell it?

18:35.666 --> 18:37.125
If the houseboat's too close to home,

18:37.208 --> 18:39.208
you and me in a nice caravan
in Camber Sands?

18:39.291 --> 18:40.583
You have, haven't you?

18:41.458 --> 18:43.666
Then how about
a fortified warehouse at midnight,

18:43.750 --> 18:46.791
filled with thugs and a couple
of married maniacs out to murder you?

18:46.875 --> 18:49.541
-More your style, right, Locky?
-Midnight tonight?

18:49.625 --> 18:52.500
-Private auction. High-value relic.
-That's the one.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.875
Fothergill's Wharf.
Right on the river. <i>My </i>territory.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.791
You'd be mad to go anywhere near.

18:58.875 --> 19:02.083
-Not without my help.
-Flo, I could kiss you.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.250
Just don't die.

19:06.833 --> 19:07.708
That will do me.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.458
Save your kisses for whatsherface.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.125
-Who?
-You're acting different around her.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.250
She's just an associate.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.458
Lockwood? Oh, sorry.

19:20.541 --> 19:23.125
This is my friend, Flo Bones.
Flo, meet George.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.750
-Head of research.
-And head chef.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.083
Unless Locky's expanded his repertoire?

19:28.166 --> 19:29.666
You like the <i>shirini morabaii?</i>

19:30.416 --> 19:31.708
Very tasty.

19:31.791 --> 19:35.291
Well, then you should come back for
my <i>noon khamei. </i>That's my real specialty.

19:36.416 --> 19:40.708
-Where've you been hiding this one, Locky?
-I was about to ask the same thing… Locky?

19:44.666 --> 19:45.833
Well, I've gotta split.

19:45.916 --> 19:49.958
See you tonight, 11:30.
Salter's Landing. Don't be late.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.458
-What's happening at 11:30?
-I'll fill you in.

19:52.541 --> 19:56.333
There's something I need to fill
you and Lucy in on first. Something big.

20:06.833 --> 20:10.500
These are ancient depictions
of spirits being tied to their sources.

20:11.125 --> 20:15.041
Bickerstaff must have come across these
illustrations and tested that theory.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.708
That's why his basement
was such a horror show.

20:18.791 --> 20:21.250
He was murdering his own patients
to make sources?

20:21.750 --> 20:23.583
No, that would be too hit-and-miss.

20:23.666 --> 20:27.916
If you kill someone, their body
isn't necessarily gonna become a source.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.125
Unless… you make sure of it.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.458
So he was taking parts of them
whilst they were still alive.

20:34.541 --> 20:38.125
Inflicting so much trauma that their
ghosts were forever tied to their bones.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.208
And… and look.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.625
-Seven ghosts.
-Oh, it's like Carver said.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.333
This, my friends,
is a recipe for a bone glass.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.291
Think the skull would know
what language these are in?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.541
Uh, we're not really
on talking terms right now.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.458
Joplin would know.

20:58.541 --> 21:01.708
-We can't let her in on this.
-No, we can trust her.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.750
I got to know her better at the archives
yesterday. We had dinner.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.750
-You had dinner with Joplin?
-In her flat, leftovers.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.916
And she was very nice.
And there's something else.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.375
Mary Dulac wrote a book.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.833
That crazy lady?
It's just gonna be mad ramblings.

21:14.916 --> 21:18.375
No, it's her confessions,
which could be the key to all of this.

21:18.458 --> 21:20.541
But hardly any were printed.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.250
The only copy I could find
is in the Black Library at Fittes.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.375
We'll have trouble enough
getting into the Fittes building now,

21:26.458 --> 21:27.875
let alone the Black Library.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.416
Mmm… I'm not so sure about that.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.125
This dropped
through the letterbox earlier.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.458
"Anthony Lockwood and Co.,

21:36.541 --> 21:40.666
the Fittes Agency invites you
to the Fittes at 50 ball."

21:41.166 --> 21:44.208
And it's tonight. Okay!

21:45.416 --> 21:49.666
Good. No, it's… it's excellent.
It means we're back in the game.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.791
Okay. Here's the plan.

21:53.333 --> 21:56.416
Get these papers translated,
find out how the bone glass was made.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.166
Go to the party, find Mary Dulac's book

21:59.250 --> 22:01.875
and figure out
exactly what that thing did to her.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.500
And then… we go and get it.

22:04.583 --> 22:07.416
-How exactly are we supposed to do that?
-Flo's found a way.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.416
You'd better go shopping.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.000
"Formal dress."

22:23.041 --> 22:24.625
Can I give you a hand with those?

22:25.958 --> 22:27.291
Are you following me?

22:27.875 --> 22:29.750
No. No, sorry, I… I didn't mean to…

22:30.583 --> 22:31.416
I…

22:32.083 --> 22:34.791
I just saw you from across the street,
so I thought I'd…

22:35.791 --> 22:36.791
Well--

22:37.708 --> 22:40.791
I spoke to Saunders.
He told me what you did the other night.

22:41.708 --> 22:45.333
-Formidable overarm, I hear.
-Yeah, well, I throw like a girl.

22:46.291 --> 22:50.208
Lockwood & Co. were nothing before you
came along. No one took them seriously.

22:50.833 --> 22:53.625
Now that's suddenly all changed.
And it's pretty obvious why.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.166
-We make a great team.
-Yeah?

22:56.708 --> 22:58.125
You're wasted here.

22:58.208 --> 23:00.208
And Fittes is a great place to work.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.541
-Yah, well, they turned me down, so--
-They made a mistake.

23:04.041 --> 23:06.625
He's probably told you
I'm the worst person in the world.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.583
If you're interested
in finding out the truth,

23:10.916 --> 23:13.250
would you consider
coming to the party with me tonight?

23:15.250 --> 23:17.708
Uh… I can't. I'm… I'm going with--

23:17.791 --> 23:19.750
-Lockwood.
-And George.

23:19.833 --> 23:20.708
Of course.

23:22.833 --> 23:25.416
I… I came in a bit too big
with the party, didn't I?

23:25.500 --> 23:28.125
-How about a coffee?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.666
-Look, I've gotta go. Get inside, get on…
-Yeah. Of course.

23:31.750 --> 23:33.416
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.750
And think about it though, yeah? Will you?

23:38.333 --> 23:39.166
All of it.

23:39.875 --> 23:40.708
Yeah.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.083
-Sorry.
-Oh.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.375
Only it's safe now.
We don't want Pamela to--

23:57.458 --> 23:59.375
Ooh, Pamela, is it now?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
-Hi.

24:07.083 --> 24:10.833
Oh! All the books and <i>kung pao</i> chicken
I could carry,

24:10.916 --> 24:12.375
and I haven't told a soul.

24:12.458 --> 24:14.375
-Come on through.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.875
-Can I come in?
-Uh… Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.208
You got everything you need?

25:17.291 --> 25:19.666
-Uh… Yeah, I think so.
-Good.

25:20.375 --> 25:21.333
Everything okay?

25:22.583 --> 25:24.000
With the skull, I mean.

25:24.083 --> 25:27.875
Oh, it's fine. Just…
It just gets in my head a bit, you know?

25:30.541 --> 25:31.416
Old friend?

25:32.416 --> 25:33.625
Hmm. The best one.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.375
This was all her idea.
Coming to London, going to parties.

25:37.458 --> 25:38.625
The big time.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.916
-And now I'm here and she's not.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.625
I just… feel like
I stole it from her, you know?

25:46.500 --> 25:47.500
Stupid, really.

25:49.666 --> 25:51.791
-You lost her?
-Ghost locked.

25:53.541 --> 25:54.750
You never said.

25:54.833 --> 25:55.958
Never asked.

25:58.083 --> 25:58.916
I'm sorry.

25:59.916 --> 26:00.833
For not asking.

26:01.958 --> 26:03.166
And for your friend.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.875
I'm sure she'd want you
to have some fun, though.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.750
Live life for the both of you.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.583
Yeah.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.875
Oh. You might like this.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.666
It belonged to, uh…

26:28.041 --> 26:29.416
someone I was very close to.

26:29.916 --> 26:31.791
But what if I lose it?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.958
You've got a good track record
with precious necklaces.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.125
Thank you.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.458
There's nothing else?

26:51.666 --> 26:53.000
You're okay?

26:53.666 --> 26:56.250
Yeah, no, honestly, I'm… I'm all good.

26:57.375 --> 26:58.666
Great. Well…

26:59.958 --> 27:02.291
-I best check on the cab.
-Yeah.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.250
George, you're not ready.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.166
Well, there's too much to do.
Just go without me.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.375
-This is all you need to know.
-Go if you want to.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.208
-I'll keep working.
-Oh, no, I don't… don't really want to.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.833
I don't like parties.
This is much more fun.

27:33.916 --> 27:38.000
Well, we'll still need you.
For the thing after, don't forget.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.666
Yeah, I won't. Don't worry.

27:40.250 --> 27:43.375
-And you'll bring the things?
-Yeah, I will. Just…

27:44.583 --> 27:45.875
Just go. We need to get on.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.583
What's the thing you need the things for?

27:54.666 --> 27:56.541
-Oh! Um…

27:57.125 --> 27:59.791
Well, don't tell anyone, but we're…

28:02.208 --> 28:04.291
We're going to get the bone glass.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.500
Wow.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.250
Oh. Where's George?

28:30.333 --> 28:32.333
He's working. He'll join us later.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
So it's just us?

28:36.041 --> 28:37.291
Is that all right?

29:22.291 --> 29:24.416
We should probably
do some mingling first, yeah?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
Make it look
like we actually came to party.

29:26.583 --> 29:30.291
Great. Two of my favorite things.
Posh people and small talk.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.750
Jesus Christ! Are those things sources?

29:34.833 --> 29:37.208
Ah. The famous relic columns.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.541
-Not a fan?

29:40.041 --> 29:42.250
Penelope's never let danger or good taste

29:42.333 --> 29:45.958
get in the way of her
showing off her family's famous legacy.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.250
Oh. Speak of the devil.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.250
Oh God. I think she saw me.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.958
-What are you doing?
-What?

30:04.041 --> 30:05.500
She's just a normal person.

30:05.583 --> 30:08.458
-She's no more special than you or me.
-I sleep in a loft.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.083
-Well, no more special than me.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.125
Ugh!

30:17.625 --> 30:20.291
-Horseradish?
-Why can't they just use gravy?

30:20.375 --> 30:22.166
Because this is civilization.

30:22.250 --> 30:23.208
Ugh.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.416
Want to do a circuit? Meet some people?

30:27.958 --> 30:30.083
-I'd rather chew my own face off.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.291
Go on, you go. I need the loo anyway.

31:21.333 --> 31:24.791
That's Long Hugh Henratty,
the highwayman.

31:24.875 --> 31:27.916
Penelope! Um… Miss Fittes. I…

31:28.541 --> 31:30.291
Uh, he… he doesn't look all that long.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.916
Wild dogs ate his legs.

31:34.041 --> 31:36.750
Tom Rotwell dug him up in 1971,

31:36.833 --> 31:41.208
while my mother kept the ghost at bay
by waving her iron spade.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.541
Good job she was a tennis player,
or she would never have had the stamina.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.291
Penelope's fine, by the way.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.875
And the job offer still stands.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.541
Kipps talked to you?

31:52.625 --> 31:53.500
Hm…

31:53.583 --> 31:55.541
Oh, you spoke to Kipps.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.291
I've known you were special
since Combe Carey.

32:00.250 --> 32:03.958
I, um… did a little research on you.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.000
And you still wanna hire me?

32:06.083 --> 32:08.666
What happened to your friends
wasn't your fault, Lucy.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.625
That was your employer's responsibility.
Not yours.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.958
We've seen to it that Mr. Jacobs will
never be in charge of agents again.

32:16.708 --> 32:19.416
There should be no place for men like him
in our industry.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.625
Oh, thank you.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.041
You know, I, um…

32:26.000 --> 32:28.041
I was always the black sheep of my family.

32:28.916 --> 32:30.833
It's taken a lot to get used to all this.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.166
I don't know how you do it.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.208
Practically everyone here's
just staring at you.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.833
Oh, they're not looking at me.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.833
Not really <i>me.</i>

32:39.083 --> 32:41.458
They're looking
at the great Penelope Fittes.

32:42.291 --> 32:43.750
Who they want me to be.

32:44.458 --> 32:47.583
And who can blame them?
It's a frightening time to be alive.

32:48.083 --> 32:51.083
People need hope. Reassurance.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.375
I'd love to help you some more, Lucy.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.125
There are benefits to being on the inside.

32:58.208 --> 33:01.375
That's… very kind.
I mean, more than I could ever… But…

33:02.375 --> 33:05.166
You feel safe with him. Mr. Lockwood.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.166
We're a team.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.666
I know that feeling.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.125
I had that once.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.000
If you ever need to talk,
I'm a good listener.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.000
I see you managed to mingle after all.

33:27.791 --> 33:31.833
-What did she want? What did she say?
-Oh, just small talk.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.583
Now, come on. We've got a job to do.

33:36.958 --> 33:39.958
-Did she offer you a job?
-How did you know that?

33:40.666 --> 33:42.291
What I would've done if I were her.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.375
If I were <i>you,</i>
I'd have bitten her hand off.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.083
-Why?
-I can't compete with this.

33:46.166 --> 33:50.041
-I never asked you to.
-What's going on, then?

33:50.125 --> 33:52.250
I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.500
Look, I saw you talking to Kipps
earlier outside.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.083
Oh.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.000
Yeah.

34:00.833 --> 34:01.916
So?

34:03.541 --> 34:04.750
He offered me a job too.

34:05.958 --> 34:08.375
-And asked me out for coffee.
-Coffee?

34:08.875 --> 34:11.875
You know, like what normal people do.
Hanging out.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.000
Like… a date?

34:14.833 --> 34:16.541
Is that so hard to believe?

34:18.333 --> 34:19.625
I turned him down.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.500
I could never work in a place like this.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.541
Too much concrete,
no smell of burnt toast.

34:24.625 --> 34:27.000
-Portland Row is my home.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.666
You and George.

34:29.416 --> 34:31.541
I'm not going anywhere. Now come on.

35:00.375 --> 35:03.583
Here's the code. 1888.

35:10.666 --> 35:12.083
Nice one, George.

35:21.291 --> 35:22.833
Pick a place to start.

35:23.708 --> 35:24.958
I'll check the index.

35:41.625 --> 35:42.708
That harp…

35:47.791 --> 35:49.041
I've got it.

35:49.125 --> 35:50.750
C/452.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.125
Check the numbers on the spines.

35:59.750 --> 36:00.791
452…

36:02.500 --> 36:03.416
No…

36:03.958 --> 36:04.791
Gotcha.

36:05.791 --> 36:08.291
-Let's see what she's got to confess to.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.791
It'll be quieter in here.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.083
So, what have they been saying?

36:18.375 --> 36:21.291
Some of the members
are getting restless.

36:21.375 --> 36:24.000
They feel you're not helping sufficiently
with their work.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.958
Exactly. <i>Their </i>work.
If they're not up to the challenge,

36:27.041 --> 36:28.750
I fail to see how that's my problem.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.208
I'm not their nursemaid.

36:30.291 --> 36:31.291
Well, quite.

36:31.375 --> 36:33.500
But you are their inspiration.

36:33.583 --> 36:36.291
They'd do well
not to forget that.

36:36.375 --> 36:40.583
But I do have something for you
to pass along. Quell their complaining.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.875
Repaired and tested.

36:48.625 --> 36:52.333
It's working again. You can tell them
it's a token of goodwill.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.458
From their inspiration.

36:55.625 --> 36:56.916
-Lucky them.
-Hmm.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.916
I'm going back where I'm appreciated.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.666
I'd offer you a drink, but I'm sure
you have somewhere more… exciting to be.

37:02.750 --> 37:03.666
Hmm.

37:04.333 --> 37:07.458
I'll hang back a few minutes.
We don't want to set tongues wagging.

37:07.541 --> 37:08.375
Oh, quite.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.208
We need to go.

37:48.958 --> 37:49.791
Now.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.125
In a hurry?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.708
Easy, now.
You wouldn't want my blade to slip.

38:04.291 --> 38:05.666
It's very sharp.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.250
And it's very nice. Is it real gold?

38:09.625 --> 38:11.666
-Who are you?
-Just a guest of the party.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.166
-I got lost on my way to the loo.
-Didn't use your map?

38:16.916 --> 38:20.125
-I've never seen that before.
-Whoever gave it to you worked here.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.000
Are you an agent?

38:24.041 --> 38:25.500
Must be some sort of alloy.

38:26.250 --> 38:27.625
Is it gold-plated?

38:28.375 --> 38:29.666
-It's a bit tacky.
-Hey!

38:30.541 --> 38:32.333
I found the way to the loo.

38:48.333 --> 38:51.541
Security. There's been a breach
in the Black Library.

38:53.083 --> 38:56.541
Oh God. They're onto us.
They're blocking all the exits.

38:56.625 --> 39:00.208
There's another four of them.
You haven't got a plan, have you?

39:01.708 --> 39:03.958
Well, I didn't, but now I do. I think.

39:18.458 --> 39:21.041
<i>The salt sprinklers</i>
<i>have been activated.</i>

39:21.625 --> 39:26.000
<i>Please calmly and carefully</i>
<i>make your way to the nearest exit.</i>

39:28.541 --> 39:31.041
<i>The salt sprinklers have been activated.</i>

39:31.583 --> 39:35.958
<i>Please calmly and carefully</i>
<i>make your way to the nearest exit.</i>

39:43.291 --> 39:45.583
This party's dead. Wanna ditch it with me?

39:45.666 --> 39:46.500
Absolutely.
