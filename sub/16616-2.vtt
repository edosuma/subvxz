00:01.543 --> 00:04.880
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.963 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.598
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:17.851
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.065
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.816
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:39.748
The Feast of San Gennaro.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.293
Every child here has seen a relative
murdered in a barber chair.

00:43.669 --> 00:44.753
Step right up!

00:45.003 --> 00:47.881
Teach an old Italian lady how
to use an iPad.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.300
Oh, that sounds like fun.
I'll give it a try.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.761
Hey, how are you? Look what I got for you.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.055
- What is it?
- It's a tablet computer.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.181
I don't want it.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.600
- But, you don't even know what it is.
- I don't want it!

00:58.684 --> 00:59.977
But you can watch movies on it.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.186
My eyes hurt.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.855
I'm trying to do something nice here.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.648
For the last time, I don't want it.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.984
I bet you if Joey was givin' it to you,
you'd take it!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.653
Don't you bring him into this.
Joey was a good boy.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.655
Oh, yeah, yeah! Joey was a good boy?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.116
You thought he was making
100 grand a year hauling lumber?

01:14.199 --> 01:16.368
- Don't you start with this!
- He was dirty, Ma!

01:16.451 --> 01:18.328
I can't hear this. I won't hear it!

01:18.412 --> 01:21.039
- He was an angel!
- Oh, that's right! Angel Joey!

01:21.123 --> 01:22.457
Great Joey! Perfect Joey!

01:22.541 --> 01:23.917
I got to go to the church.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.420
Oh, yeah, sure. Light another candle.
That'll bring him back!

01:26.503 --> 01:28.213
- You watch your tongue!
- Admit it!

01:28.297 --> 01:30.424
You wish it was me in that car
instead of him!

01:30.507 --> 01:32.259
Just take your little TV and go!

01:32.342 --> 01:34.094
It's an iPad, you dumb cow!

01:35.345 --> 01:37.973
I guess I don't have any sons now.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.266
Ma!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.767
I'm sorry, Ma!

01:40.851 --> 01:41.852
Ma!

01:41.935 --> 01:43.187
Ma!

01:44.354 --> 01:45.439
Hey, Brian. Look over there.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.482
That guy looks like Frank Sinatra Jr.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.777
Stewie, this is Federal Hill.
Everybody looks like Frank Sinatra Jr.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.280
Well, then, who's that guy
who looks like a young Frank Sinatra?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.115
Oh, that's Woody Allen's son,
but you're right,

01:55.199 --> 01:57.576
that other guy behind him
is Frank Sinatra Jr.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.286
Stewie, Elliot.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.748
It... It's actually Brian.
We've... We've met many times before.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.124
Then who's Elliot?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.626
I... I really wouldn't know.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
This is a bad start to whatever
we're doing.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.130
Well, now, what brings you fellas
to the festival?

02:10.339 --> 02:13.634
My dad will drive long distances
for ice with colored liquid in it.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.760
They got blue!

02:14.843 --> 02:16.470
And we all love the Italian food.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.597
Oh, you like Italian food?

02:18.680 --> 02:19.932
Want a meatball?

02:20.015 --> 02:21.141
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.

02:21.225 --> 02:24.645
But it's a shame we can't get
good Italian food like this in Quahog.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.398
Well, maybe the three of us
ought to open an Italian restaurant there.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.692
Open our own Italian restaurant?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.236
I say, that sounds fun.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.779
You, uh...

02:33.862 --> 02:35.322
You keep meatballs in your jacket?

02:35.405 --> 02:38.200
Oh, yeah. All my pockets
are lined with Reynolds Wrap.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.869
I'd learned that from my old buddies,
Dean Martin Jr.,

02:40.953 --> 02:43.956
Joey Bishop Jr., and Sammy Davis III.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.416
Hey, where's Chris?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
He's over there,
playing that carnival game.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.711
Step right up.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.631
Everybody take a chance
on Whack A-Big Pussy!

02:53.090 --> 02:54.550
- Hey, Tone.
- Hey, Tone.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.051
- Hey, Tone.
- Hey, Tone.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.428
This is not what I thought it was!

03:01.265 --> 03:03.392
Oh, my God! Chris is out of control.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.518
I know.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.937
It must be all the violence in movies
and sex on TV.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.021
Oh!

03:08.105 --> 03:09.439
- See, I listen.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.656
Peter, we need to talk about
what happened at the street fair.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.241
Lois, it's an Italian festival.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.034
You're supposed to yell, <i>"Bella, bella,"</i>

03:21.118 --> 03:22.828
and grab as much fat ass as you can.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.663
No, I'm talking about Chris.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.833
I had no idea he had
so much pent-up aggression.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.836
We have to deal with his anger issues
before he hurts himself.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.296
Yeah, that's good thinking, Lois.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.299
I've seen what happens when people
hold in their aggression for too long.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.593
Don't forget,
I was in that elevator with Jay-Z.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.679
Hey, could you have your guy hit two?

03:40.762 --> 03:43.765
I got to get down to the business center
to print out my boarding pass.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.976
Oh! Hey! That's gonna leave a mark.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.603
That's from a movie.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.688
So you girls traveling with your dad here?

03:50.439 --> 03:53.025
Hey, don't kick him, muddy shoes.
He's got a white suit on.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.611
Hey, look, I don't know if you guys
are really staying here,

03:55.694 --> 03:58.197
but you can't get into the pool
without a room key.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.620
Okay, Chris,
your mom and I want to help you

04:04.703 --> 04:05.954
get out some of that aggression,

04:06.038 --> 04:09.291
so I thought you and me could
huck rotten apples at passing cars.

04:10.876 --> 04:14.213
Oh, I didn't know we had
brown apple in the forecast.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.631
Well, we needed it.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.719
Wow! Can I have a turn?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.729
Hey! Which one of you
threw that apple at my car?

04:30.812 --> 04:33.690
He did it! He dragged me out here.
I wanted to be in school, sir.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.984
Where'd you get a cannon like that, kid?

04:36.068 --> 04:38.195
I work out my right arm three times a day.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.321
Hmm. Free weights?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.949
No, mostly JPEGs of Helen Hunt
on my hard drive.

04:42.241 --> 04:45.327
Well, I'm Coach Doyle and I head up
the baseball team at James Woods High.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.788
What fake class
do they also make you teach?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.706
- Driver's ed, right?
- No, wood shop.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.124
Ah, that was my second guess.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.127
Tell me, son. How would you like
to pitch for the high school team?

04:54.211 --> 04:56.797
Baseball's the sport
people play while eating, right?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.258
Oh, yeah. Sometimes,
I even watch a whole <i>Blacklist.</i>

04:59.341 --> 05:02.010
I don't know.
I've never played baseball before.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.720
Aw, come on, Chris. You gotta do it.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.930
If you don't, you'll regret it.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.016
Just like Jesus' friend, Evan,
who bailed on the Last Supper.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.352
Aw, they did a paintin'?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.729
I would've gone if I knew
they were gonna do a paintin'.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.527
Here we are, fellas.

05:18.610 --> 05:22.030
The future site
of Quahog's newest Italian restaurant.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.367
Wow! This is a great location.
Can we afford this?

05:25.450 --> 05:28.203
Sure, we can.
I set up one of those Kickstarters.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.080
Then I realized how stupid that is,

05:30.163 --> 05:32.624
and I went to the bank for a loan
like an adult.

05:32.708 --> 05:36.628
Now, fellas, the tables should all be
bolted to the floor to prevent theft.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.463
You know, most restaurants
go out of business

05:38.547 --> 05:40.549
because people are stealing the tables.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.051
The toilets should also
be bolted to the floor.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.387
I think that's pretty standard,
Frank, but okay.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
Great. Now let's go find
some chump's restaurant

05:47.556 --> 05:49.224
and steal his tables and toilets.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.235
<i>James Woods is winning for now.</i>

06:00.319 --> 06:03.238
<i>But y'all never know what might happen</i>
<i>in the moments to come.</i>

06:03.322 --> 06:07.117
<i>I mean, look. There's two baseball guys</i>
<i>out on the bases right now.</i>

06:07.201 --> 06:09.620
<i>What if they's run to the scoring place?</i>

06:13.123 --> 06:15.334
<i>Oh, here comes the new boy.</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:17.127
All right, Chris!

06:17.211 --> 06:19.254
Wow! I've never seen him
run onto a baseball field

06:19.338 --> 06:22.424
when he wasn't chasing a duck
or being chased by a duck.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.592
Is that a duck over there?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.220
Ah, come on!
What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking

06:26.303 --> 06:28.013
bringing in that fat slob?

06:28.096 --> 06:29.097
You know what?

06:29.181 --> 06:32.893
I bet you 100 bucks that fat slob
strikes this kid out.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.353
Ha! You're on.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.066
Strike one!

06:42.819 --> 06:43.946
Strike two!

06:44.029 --> 06:45.030
<i>Ooh!</i>

06:53.288 --> 06:54.498
Strike three!

06:57.167 --> 06:58.877
<i>Three strikes and he's out.</i>

06:58.961 --> 07:01.338
<i>Just like my cousin Freddie</i>
<i>with the drugs.</i>

07:02.965 --> 07:05.133
Holy crap! A hundred bucks!

07:05.217 --> 07:06.301
Hey, nice going, Chris!

07:08.387 --> 07:10.556
Wow, look how proud my dad is.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.224
Oh, my God! A duck!

07:13.559 --> 07:14.935
It was a trap!

07:24.027 --> 07:26.113
Guys, tonight, the drinks are on me.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.824
I just won 100 bucks
off Chris' baseball game.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.659
Really? How'd you do that?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.245
This dad took one look at Chris
and thought he'd suck,

07:33.328 --> 07:35.539
but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.250
I'm so proud of the money
I won bettin' on him.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.586
You know, I'd bet there are plenty
of other baseball dads

07:40.669 --> 07:42.254
who'd also assume Chris stinks.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.630
Peter, we could make a lot of money.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.924
Yeah, we could make Toni Braxton money.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.135
Is that... Is that a lot?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.303
It's a lot.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.512
And then nothing.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.932
And then a record whose proceeds
go directly to creditors.

08:01.982 --> 08:07.237
<i>Put me in coach</i>
<i>I'm ready to play today</i>

08:08.697 --> 08:14.244
<i>Put me in coach</i>
<i>I'm ready to play today</i>

08:14.912 --> 08:19.291
<i>Look at me, I can be centerfield</i>

08:21.418 --> 08:24.922
<i>Well, I spent some time</i>
<i>in the Mudville Nine</i>

08:25.506 --> 08:27.674
<i>Watching it from the bench</i>

08:28.300 --> 08:32.888
<i>You know I took some lumps</i>
<i>when the mighty Case struck out</i>

08:34.973 --> 08:38.352
<i>So say, hey, Willie, tell the Cobb</i>

08:38.685 --> 08:41.271
<i>And Joe DiMaggio</i>

08:41.688 --> 08:46.318
<i>Don't say it ain't so</i>
<i>You know the time is now</i>

08:54.284 --> 08:55.744
Frank, where the hell is everybody?

08:55.827 --> 08:57.454
This was supposed to be
our big opening night.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.997
I'll tell you what the problem is.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.917
Every successful restaurant
has a hook or a gimmick.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.252
That's what we're lacking.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.087
No, we're not.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.839
Frank, you're the hook!

09:06.922 --> 09:09.466
That's right. We just need to make you
the face of the restaurant.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.093
Well, it may be the five loaves

09:11.176 --> 09:13.512
of garlic bread I ate this
morning talkin',

09:13.595 --> 09:15.305
but I think it's a swell idea.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.231
<i>You'll love the meal</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:25.941
<i>The fancy feel</i>

09:26.024 --> 09:29.152
<i>The showbiz story is why you eat your veal</i>

09:29.236 --> 09:32.281
<i>It's family dining with a mobster feel</i>

09:32.573 --> 09:35.242
<i>At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:37.494
<i>- Junior!</i>
<i>- The wine is red</i>

09:37.578 --> 09:39.204
<i>With lots of bread</i>

09:39.496 --> 09:42.624
<i>And portions are bigger </i>
<i>than a horse's head</i>

09:42.749 --> 09:45.878
<i>You'll burp up sausages tonight in bed</i>

09:45.961 --> 09:49.214
<i>At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

09:49.756 --> 09:51.300
<i>Here's a toast</i>

09:53.051 --> 09:55.095
<i>To our host</i>

09:56.471 --> 09:58.182
<i>Where food's not great</i>

09:58.432 --> 10:02.394
<i>But drink enough and you won't know</i>

10:02.728 --> 10:04.229
<i>The guests will swoon</i>

10:04.313 --> 10:05.856
<i>And Frank will croon</i>

10:05.939 --> 10:08.817
<i>A beep-bop-dooby-dop Italian tune</i>

10:09.234 --> 10:15.032
<i>You dine like royalty</i>
<i>at Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

10:17.576 --> 10:20.996
<i>We got big plans to please our fans</i>

10:21.079 --> 10:24.249
<i>Our cocktail waitress has enormous cans</i>

10:24.583 --> 10:27.669
<i>A men's room servant</i>
<i>who will dry your hands</i>

10:27.753 --> 10:30.464
<i>At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

10:30.672 --> 10:34.218
<i>Our pizza pies could win a prize</i>

10:34.468 --> 10:37.513
<i>The jukebox catalog is double size</i>

10:37.596 --> 10:40.265
<i>It plays both Capitol and yes, Reprise</i>

10:40.349 --> 10:43.769
<i>- That's "Repreese"</i>
<i>- At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

10:44.895 --> 10:47.105
<i>Gorgeous views</i>

10:48.106 --> 10:50.234
<i>And top-shelf booze</i>

10:51.360 --> 10:53.570
<i>Yes, we serve Jews</i>

10:53.654 --> 10:54.696
Um...

10:54.780 --> 10:57.115
<i>That was never an issue</i>

10:57.616 --> 11:00.869
<i>So raise your glass</i>
<i>We'll have a gas</i>

11:00.953 --> 11:03.830
<i>The seating's limited, so move your ass</i>

11:04.289 --> 11:10.504
<i>And plant it firmly</i>
<i>Here at Frank Sinatra's Restaurant</i>

11:10.587 --> 11:13.507
<i>Frank's Restaurant</i>

11:13.924 --> 11:20.097
<i>Frank's Restaurant</i>

11:30.399 --> 11:31.942
Wow, look at this, guys.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.653
I can't believe we made all this
in one game.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.155
Yeah, I'm having a great time
handling this money

11:37.239 --> 11:38.490
and then touching my eyeball.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.159
Jerome! Another round
for my blurry friends.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.036
Yeah, we got a good thing goin'.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.539
We just have to keep Chris' talent
a secret.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.874
<i>Good Evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

11:46.957 --> 11:49.918
<i>Our top story tonight.</i>
<i>The James Woods High baseball team</i>

11:50.002 --> 11:53.046
<i>is headed to the district championship</i>
<i>thanks to their secret weapon,</i>

11:53.130 --> 11:54.715
<i>star pitcher, Chris Griffin.</i>

11:55.340 --> 11:57.968
Ah, crap! Now everyone knows
Chris is a ringer!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
Tom Tucker just ruined everything.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.514
This sucks even worse
than when I stubbed my toe!

12:04.141 --> 12:05.350
- Ah!

12:05.434 --> 12:08.270
Why does everything bad
always happen to me?

12:08.687 --> 12:11.481
Answer me, guy in box and guy on cross!

12:18.864 --> 12:19.948
Stewie, can I talk to you?

12:20.032 --> 12:23.285
Look, Brian, I affectionately pat
all the waiters on the arse.

12:23.368 --> 12:26.371
And if anyone has a problem with
it, they should come to me directly!

12:26.455 --> 12:29.124
No, no, it's not that.
I've been going through our receipts,

12:29.208 --> 12:30.792
and we're actually losing money.

12:30.876 --> 12:31.877
Well, yeah, duh.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.505
Frank comps every meal.
Look, he's doing it again.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.840
Little-known secret about Charlton Heston.

12:36.924 --> 12:40.219
Never used toilet paper. Just drop and go.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.054
Here, let me get that check for you.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.311
Well, it's official.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.230
Nobody wants to bet against Chris now.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.399
Damn it! I can't believe my kid
isn't making money for us anymore.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.401
I feel like Jessica Simpson's dad.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.072
Well, there are plenty of guys willing
to bet on James Woods High to win,

13:00.155 --> 13:01.406
I'll tell you that.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.576
The only way we can ever
make money now is if Chris lost.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.620
Wait a minute, Joe! That's it!

13:06.703 --> 13:09.748
All we got to do is take those bets
and get Chris to take a dive.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.916
Hold on, Peter.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.877
You're gonna ask your own son
to lose on purpose?

13:13.961 --> 13:17.047
Damn, Quagmire, your fridge
gives you water from the door?

13:21.093 --> 13:22.845
Hey, champ, what you doin'?

13:22.928 --> 13:24.221
My Spanish homework.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.432
Oh, well, then maybe
I'll just say this to you in Spanish.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.421
Chris, what the hell are you doing?

13:57.504 --> 14:00.090
Calm down.
This is how they package Snapple now.

14:00.174 --> 14:01.884
They're trying to trick kids
into drinking it.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.844
You may not believe this,
but there was a time

14:03.927 --> 14:05.554
when Snapple ruled the nation.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.805
Preposterous!

14:06.889 --> 14:09.308
It's true. Even Jerry Seinfeld drank it.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.518
And he was the president of the '90s.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.312
But why are you so down?

14:13.395 --> 14:16.732
Dad told me I have to lose
the championship game on purpose.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.108
He what?

14:18.192 --> 14:20.110
Peter! Get in here right now!

14:20.569 --> 14:22.779
Wow! Someone's day-horny.

14:22.863 --> 14:23.906
Oh, hey, Chris.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.117
Did you tell Chris he had to lose
the district championship?

14:27.201 --> 14:29.161
Let me just get a garbage bag. Hold on.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.374
Okay, now that I'm decent,

14:34.750 --> 14:36.960
yes, I did tell Chris to throw the game,

14:37.044 --> 14:38.378
but it's okay, it's for gambling.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.590
What? You're betting
on Chris' baseball team?

14:41.673 --> 14:43.967
Technically, against Chris' baseball team.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.512
- Are you crazy?
- Do I look crazy?

14:46.595 --> 14:48.180
What do you think
puts the food on our table

14:48.263 --> 14:49.890
and the garbage bags on our backs?

14:50.182 --> 14:51.767
Chris, your father's a jackass.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.646
When you get on that field,
you try your very best and play to win.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.772
You understand me?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.774
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.485
But, Lois, if Chris wins that game,
I'll be out a ton of money,

15:01.568 --> 15:03.278
and I'll have to kiss a fella.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.696
I take all kinds of bets.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.036
Hey, Frank, we have to talk.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.455
You've got to stop giving away
all the food for free.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.582
Yeah, otherwise, there's no way
we're gonna make a profit.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.417
Oh, we don't have to worry about money.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.379
I might be doing a duets thing
with that Lady Goo-Ga.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.505
Uh-huh. That's wrong.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.424
Anyway, the restaurant's gonna go under
if you keep giving away food.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.134
All right, all right.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.219
Thank you, Frank.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.054
I appreciate you trying it my way.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.056
Thank you.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.641
What was that?

15:32.724 --> 15:36.061
Oh, I get 40 bucks every time
somebody says, "My Way."

15:36.395 --> 15:37.896
Nancy gets $60.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.069
What do you mean Chris won't take a dive?

15:44.152 --> 15:45.571
We already took a ton of bets.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.283
Look, I'm sorry, you guys,
but my hot-piece-of-ass wife says no way.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.910
That's a weird time to brag
about your wife, Peter.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.662
I don't know. I've just been
so horny today.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.372
Oh, man. I don't need to know that.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.166
Well, pull it together, Peter,
'cause we're about to lose a lot of money!

15:58.250 --> 15:59.459
I know.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.380
We're screwed once Chris takes the mound
with that awesome arm of his.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.840
Wait, so what you're saying is...

16:05.257 --> 16:07.676
Chris isn't the problem, his arm is.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.760
Yeah, I guess.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.347
Okay, we hear you, Peter.

16:12.431 --> 16:14.641
Loud and clear.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.643
Yeah, we'll fix this problem.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.687
Wait, you guys are creeping me out.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.231
All right, I'm gonna exit
while discreetly checking out

16:21.315 --> 16:22.691
the hot chick by the door.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.116
You guys heard what I heard, right?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.452
Peter just asked us to break Chris' arm.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.912
Well, he intimated.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.038
I don't know what that means,

16:36.121 --> 16:38.498
but let's go rough up a teenager
for beer money!

16:38.582 --> 16:40.209
Oh, I call biting.

16:46.882 --> 16:49.301
Okay, there's the baseball team's
locker room right there.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.427
Perfect.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.054
And we look like
regular high school students,

16:52.137 --> 16:53.472
so we'll fit right in.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.893
Joe, are you sure about these clothes?

16:57.976 --> 16:58.977
Trust me.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.396
I bought the absolute latest issue
of <i>Archie Comics,</i>

17:01.480 --> 17:03.315
and this is what the kids are wearing.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.693
Oh, hey, fellow teens.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.655
Wait a minute.
Teenagers don't have wheelchairs!

17:09.738 --> 17:12.074
Ow! Ow!

17:18.121 --> 17:20.582
Okay, guys, we've served our
last free meal.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.334
Here I go with the check.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.337
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.632
Last time we ate here,
Mr. Sinatra's son said it was free.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.759
Okay, uh, everyone. New policy.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.761
As is the case with many restaurants,

17:32.845 --> 17:34.805
you're going to have to pay for your food.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.516
What? This food ain't worth paying for.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.352
Yeah, the only reason we eat here
is 'cause it's free.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.356
Look whose restaurant thinks it's so good.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.192
Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's restaurant,
you would have paid.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.446
Ma! I'm sorry, Ma!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.031
Ma!

17:54.366 --> 17:55.784
I can't believe it.

17:55.868 --> 17:56.952
They hated us.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.996
Well, fellas, we gave it our best shot.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.206
If you need me,
I'll be back in Palm Springs,

18:01.290 --> 18:03.876
which has been
completely taken over by the gays.

18:04.835 --> 18:08.130
So, want to grab whatever wine is left
and then burn the place down?

18:08.213 --> 18:09.214
Maybe.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.633
But first, let's have an unearned
end-of-the-series moment,

18:11.717 --> 18:13.969
where we turn out the lights
on our own place.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.849
Sorry, pal. We're closed.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.626
Peter, we've got great news.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.919
Chris isn't playing!

18:47.002 --> 18:48.337
He's not? Why?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.464
Because we broke his arm
like you told us to.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.007
Shattered. We shattered his arm.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.134
You what? I never told you do that!

18:54.218 --> 18:56.345
You didn't? That's what I thought I heard.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.347
Quagmire, this is humbling.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.767
But it may be time for all of us
to talk about hearing aids.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.060
I feel terrible!

19:03.143 --> 19:04.561
I gotta go find my son!

19:07.940 --> 19:09.399
- Chris!
- Dad!

19:09.483 --> 19:12.027
My arm's broke, and look, a Camaro!

19:12.110 --> 19:13.612
Aw, that guy must be so boss.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.532
But listen, Chris,
I had no idea this was gonna happen.

19:16.615 --> 19:19.034
Look, I was wrong to bet on your games.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.161
And it's even worse that I told
you to lose.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.287
I'm so sorry.

19:22.371 --> 19:23.830
Oh, that's okay, Dad.

19:23.914 --> 19:28.335
I just feel bad that my arm is broken
in so many places and hurts so much.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.380
Oh, Chris. I've been
a terrible dad lately.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.883
You found something you were great at,
and instead of being happy for you,

19:34.967 --> 19:36.760
I tried to use it to make money.

19:37.261 --> 19:40.180
And now your arm is broken,
and your baseball career is over.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.057
Not necessarily.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.433
What? What are you talking about?

19:43.517 --> 19:44.560
Well, for the last few weeks

19:44.643 --> 19:47.020
since my right arm's
been exhausted from pitching,

19:47.104 --> 19:52.192
my left arm's had to, uh,
pick up the slack in the bathroom.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.166
You see the pitcher? That's my kid.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.256
Ah! Son of a bitch!

20:14.339 --> 20:17.134
Oh, my God! Sorry, Mr. Quagmire.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.760
I heard that bone break.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.220
My ears are fine.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.852
Well, Chris, we are very proud of you

20:26.935 --> 20:29.104
for making it to the district
championship.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.230
Thanks, Mom.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.107
Ah, he was really something, Lois.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.651
The next pitch Chris threw
hit his coach in the head,

20:34.735 --> 20:36.653
so there was no one
to take him out of the game.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.948
Chris walked the next 46 batters.
State record.

20:40.032 --> 20:42.492
Wow, Chris! State record.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.952
Yeah, they got crushed.

20:44.036 --> 20:47.122
But at least I didn't have to pay out
all those bets and kiss a guy.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.708
But I saw you kissing
the driver of that Camaro.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.211
That... That... That was something else.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.963
Baseball.
