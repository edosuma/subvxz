flat irons on your
employee discount, right?

20:04.597 --> 20:06.139
Oh, yeah, we can do that.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.717
That's what I'm sayin'.

20:08.601 --> 20:10.018
This shirt's on sale.

20:10.019 --> 20:11.645
You get another 15%.

20:11.646 --> 20:13.730
Okay, cool. We can do that.

20:13.731 --> 20:15.148
How much do I owe you?

20:15.149 --> 20:16.941
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:16.942 --> 20:18.485
There were three fatalities.

20:18.486 --> 20:21.946
The investigation is still
ongoing and the FBI is also

20:21.947 --> 20:23.691
going to look into the case.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.869
Now, on a lighter note, some of
our viewers may remember our story

20:27.870 --> 20:30.372
about one of America's
truest treasures...

20:30.373 --> 20:31.873
Whiskey the Cat,

20:31.874 --> 20:33.875
the ferocious feline who became a hero

20:33.876 --> 20:36.919
when he fought off a pit bull
protecting his six-year-old owner.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.005
He sustained a deep
laceration on his side

20:39.006 --> 20:40.757
and I am proud to report

20:40.758 --> 20:42.884
that he's back home resting comfortably.

20:42.885 --> 20:44.886
Thank God, for Whiskey.

20:44.887 --> 20:46.054
Whiskey the Cat!

20:46.055 --> 20:47.639
Seriously, Whiskey the Cat?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.516
- (KARA LAUGHING)
- I shouldn't even let you sit in my car

20:49.517 --> 20:50.684
making me read that crap.

20:50.685 --> 20:51.934
KARA: No, no, no. Hey.

20:51.935 --> 20:54.354
You read it with dignity, okay?

20:54.355 --> 20:57.649
Whiskey the Cat is
America's truest treasure.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.401
Pet stories are skewing well.

20:59.402 --> 21:01.027
What the hell can I tell you?

21:01.028 --> 21:02.362
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:02.363 --> 21:03.613
Don't snort in my car.

21:03.614 --> 21:05.281
(SNORTING LAUGH) I'm sorry.

21:05.282 --> 21:07.325
We should bring Whiskey in this car.

21:07.326 --> 21:08.910
(SNORTING LAUGH) Oh, my goodness...

21:08.911 --> 21:10.579
How much is this thing anyway?

21:10.580 --> 21:12.247
You know, it's not about the
price. It's not about the price.

21:12.248 --> 21:14.249
It's... It's, um... It pays for itself.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.125
- KARA: Oh.
- And it's good for the environment.

21:16.126 --> 21:17.627
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

21:17.628 --> 21:18.878
KARA: Right, the environment.

21:18.879 --> 21:20.463
Right, right, right.

21:20.464 --> 21:23.717
Don't you have to set up a... A whole
charging station and whatnot for this car?

21:23.718 --> 21:24.842
How much is that?

21:24.843 --> 21:25.927
MARY JANE: It's not that much.

21:25.928 --> 21:27.178
You should buy one.

21:27.179 --> 21:28.764
- A Tesla?
- Yeah.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.973
Yeah. No, I'll wait,
thank you very much.

21:30.974 --> 21:32.058
Why?

21:32.059 --> 21:33.142
Because I have them.

21:33.143 --> 21:34.811
That's why.

21:34.812 --> 21:35.978
(BOYS LAUGHING)

21:35.979 --> 21:37.606
What are you guys watching?

21:37.607 --> 21:38.815
Video of this man.

21:38.816 --> 21:40.983
He puts butter on stairs
and watches people fall down.

21:40.984 --> 21:42.944
- (MARY JANE LAUGHING)
- That's not funny.

21:42.945 --> 21:44.404
- MARY JANE: No, actually, it is.
- No, it's not.

21:44.405 --> 21:45.988
Did you guys see the one
where they put the baby oil

21:45.989 --> 21:47.115
on the bathroom floor
for when people come

21:47.116 --> 21:48.575
- out of the shower?
- Oh, God.

21:48.576 --> 21:49.951
No, where'd you find that?

21:49.952 --> 21:51.077
Stop encouraging them.

21:51.078 --> 21:52.954
- It's so good.
- Seriously, zip it.

21:52.955 --> 21:55.957
Guys, hey, go wait in the
car for a minute, please?

21:55.958 --> 21:56.958
Fine.

21:56.959 --> 21:58.042
I'll be there real soon.

21:58.043 --> 21:59.711
- Later, fellas. Thanks.
- Thank you.

21:59.712 --> 22:01.087
Thank you. Thank you.

22:01.088 --> 22:03.081
Oh, my goodness...

22:05.008 --> 22:06.301
Oh...

22:06.302 --> 22:08.428
John had to work, so I
picked them up from school.

22:08.429 --> 22:10.472
And they heard I was
coming to see "The Tesla,"

22:10.473 --> 22:12.307
so they wanted to tag along.

22:12.308 --> 22:14.092
It's all good. Please.

22:14.977 --> 22:16.978
How are you doing?

22:16.979 --> 22:21.232
Oh, girl, if I don't have sex
soon, I'm gonna freakin' break

22:21.233 --> 22:22.692
the shower head off.

22:22.693 --> 22:23.985
I'm not even joking.

22:23.986 --> 22:28.030
Okay, uh, I was talking
about you and John shacking up

22:28.031 --> 22:29.282
and the kids and the whole thing.

22:29.283 --> 22:31.660
But, yeah, that... That works.

22:31.661 --> 22:33.654
You know, we're trying to work it out.

22:33.996 --> 22:35.913
Today was a good day.

22:35.914 --> 22:37.700
How are you feeling with Mark leaving?

22:39.001 --> 22:40.918
I wanna kick him in his face,

22:40.919 --> 22:42.671
quite frankly, now that you ask.

22:42.672 --> 22:45.381
I mean, I had that damn
show running on autopilot,

22:45.382 --> 22:48.343
easy money, and now I've
actually gotta work for it.

22:48.344 --> 22:50.720
They wanna rotate in some
anchors and see who sticks,

22:50.721 --> 22:52.597
<i>just like they did on Talk Back,</i>

22:52.598 --> 22:55.517
because I'm not overwhelmed, as it is.

22:55.518 --> 22:56.768
It sounds stressful.

22:56.769 --> 22:59.020
- Yo, if you ever need a place to crash...
- Mmm-hmm?

22:59.021 --> 23:00.480
You're more than welcome to stay here.

23:00.481 --> 23:03.141
Thank you. That's sweet. I
might take you up on that one.

23:04.026 --> 23:06.027
All right, time to go.

23:06.028 --> 23:08.029
(LAUGHING) Where are you going?

23:08.030 --> 23:11.149
To, uh, the surprise party
my family's throwing for me.

23:11.826 --> 23:13.034
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:13.035 --> 23:16.238
Are you sure? Because nobody
called me to invite me.

23:17.039 --> 23:18.915
That's kinda weird.

23:18.916 --> 23:20.124
Well, maybe it's just a family thing.

23:20.125 --> 23:21.459
I mean, even PJ flew in.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.919
Girl, PJ ain't flyin' in for you.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.045
You know he's a mama's boy.

23:24.046 --> 23:25.963
Patrick baked a cake, okay,

23:25.964 --> 23:27.757
triple chocolate cake, my favorite.

23:27.758 --> 23:30.051
It's a party. They did not forget me.

23:30.052 --> 23:32.053
- All right.
- I'm unforgettable.

23:32.054 --> 23:34.639
Oh... Without a doubt.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.349
Let me let you get to your "party."

23:36.350 --> 23:38.976
- Let me get with... Where's the damn door handle...
- It's right there.

23:38.977 --> 23:40.311
On this Tesla?

23:40.312 --> 23:41.688
Right there, grandma.

23:41.689 --> 23:43.064
What happened to door handles?

23:43.065 --> 23:44.607
Oh, my God...

23:44.608 --> 23:47.652
I'll just be going into
my little Volvo now.

23:47.653 --> 23:50.071
- Bye.
- Go on with your party and chocolate cake.

23:50.072 --> 23:53.074
- (MARY JANE LAUGHING)
- KARA: All right, guys, we're outta here.

23:53.075 --> 23:54.360
Chocolate cake.

24:25.107 --> 24:26.858
Seriously?

24:26.859 --> 24:29.110
Letta, what are you doing here?

24:29.111 --> 24:32.606
Uh, I came back to help
with the rotation, remember?

24:33.156 --> 24:35.658
Oh. Actually, Mom's good.

24:35.659 --> 24:38.119
She's been chillin' most of
the day, slept most of the day.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.121
Uh, I guess those meds
she's on put her out.

24:40.122 --> 24:41.623
So, you don't need me.

24:41.624 --> 24:43.124
I guess not. (CHUCKLES)

24:43.125 --> 24:45.126
Well, where's everybody else?

24:45.127 --> 24:47.128
Uh, where is everybody?

24:47.129 --> 24:49.589
Patrick's home. Dad went
to pick Niecy up from work.

24:49.590 --> 24:51.458
Wait! You guys really
forgot my birthday?

24:52.175 --> 24:54.010
Damn, it is the 21st.

24:54.011 --> 24:55.136
Oh, my God.

24:55.137 --> 24:57.096
Wait, oh, wait! Letta, Letta, Letta...

24:57.097 --> 24:59.223
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

24:59.224 --> 25:01.476
Look, I've been dealing
with Mom and work stuff.

25:01.477 --> 25:03.144
Work stuff?

25:03.145 --> 25:04.145
Yeah.

25:04.146 --> 25:05.305
You mean like bid rigging?

25:05.731 --> 25:07.398
- Huh?
- Huh?

25:07.399 --> 25:09.768
Seven years of college
and all you got is "Huh?"

25:11.946 --> 25:13.154
How about "So?"

25:13.155 --> 25:14.530
Your arrogant little ass

25:14.531 --> 25:17.158
is actually admitting to being involved.

25:17.159 --> 25:19.035
- Look...
- Have you lost your mind?

25:19.036 --> 25:21.621
I'm tired of white businessmen
telling us to play one game

25:21.622 --> 25:23.665
while they're playing another
that's helping them build wealth.

25:23.666 --> 25:26.167
- Yeah, okay, the Bushs and the Kennedys...
- Yeah.

25:26.168 --> 25:29.838
And all the Rockefellers, yes, they did
some shady stuff to build their empires.

25:29.839 --> 25:31.923
Key difference... They're white!

25:31.924 --> 25:34.550
Well, good you know that I'm
just following the American way.

25:34.551 --> 25:37.720
And it's also the American way
to bury black men under the jail.

25:37.721 --> 25:40.306
- (SCOFFS)
- You're facing a Federal investigation.

25:40.307 --> 25:43.267
- Uh-uh.
- No, there is way too much money on the table

25:43.268 --> 25:46.437
and if you think that they're gonna let
an Asian woman and a black dude get it,

25:46.438 --> 25:49.231
- you're delusional.
- Letta, I set up a different company.

25:49.232 --> 25:52.401
- All right, look, it's hard to trace me back to Barbara.
- Okay.

25:52.402 --> 25:54.236
My setup, oh, God, Letta,
my setup is so tight.

25:54.237 --> 25:56.906
I have a chance to make $25 million.

25:56.907 --> 25:58.700
She's already under investigation.

25:58.701 --> 26:00.236
You're... You're aware of that?

26:01.119 --> 26:02.871
Get out while you can.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.205
Baby, you're the fall guy.

26:04.206 --> 26:07.243
You show up just in time to do her time.

26:07.584 --> 26:09.168
Come on.

26:09.169 --> 26:10.211
Don't you think I've thought about that?

26:10.212 --> 26:11.462
No, I don't think you've
thought about that!

26:11.463 --> 26:12.922
No, you didn't think about that!

26:12.923 --> 26:15.591
Letta! Look, look, look, I'm
not stupid, okay? $25 mil...

26:15.592 --> 26:18.761
That's about all of us,
all of us building wealth.

26:18.762 --> 26:20.847
Look around you. Our parents
are in their golden age

26:20.848 --> 26:23.224
and should not be in the position
they are financially, all right?

26:23.225 --> 26:24.767
They're supposed to be relaxing,

26:24.768 --> 26:26.519
not taking care of Patrick's daughter

26:26.520 --> 26:27.979
or their grandchildren.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.939
Blah, blah, blah. What do
you think happens to Mom

26:29.940 --> 26:32.149
when she finds out you're in jail? Huh?

26:32.150 --> 26:33.393
It'll kill her.

26:34.111 --> 26:35.236
Is the money worth it to you?

26:35.237 --> 26:36.487
Is it that important to you?

26:36.488 --> 26:39.198
We have a nephew named
Treyvion who has a mother

26:39.199 --> 26:41.200
with a penchant for hoodies.

26:41.201 --> 26:44.412
Now get this, with all my
pedigree, they barely want me,

26:44.413 --> 26:45.580
okay, they barely want me.

26:45.581 --> 26:47.206
Do the math, Letta.

26:47.207 --> 26:51.252
He's well on his way to
minimum wage if we're lucky.

26:51.253 --> 26:52.962
Selling him a little short
for three, aren't you?

26:52.963 --> 26:54.589
Am I?

26:54.590 --> 26:57.960
We live in the South where they shoot
at kids named Treyvion for sport.

26:59.428 --> 27:01.012
Look, if I can...

27:01.013 --> 27:03.806
No, no, when...

27:03.807 --> 27:06.935
When I make this work,
I not only set myself up,

27:06.936 --> 27:09.270
but I set up the generations
and put the Pattersons

27:09.271 --> 27:11.182
back on the road to greatness.

27:12.024 --> 27:14.275
You're not the only
one thinking about that.

27:14.276 --> 27:17.194
Selling weed and bid rigging, PJ,

27:17.195 --> 27:19.148
is not gonna make you a hero.

27:19.865 --> 27:22.033
It makes you a criminal.

27:22.034 --> 27:23.568
And you're way too smart for that.

27:24.202 --> 27:25.286
I get it.

27:25.287 --> 27:28.497
Honestly, I absolutely get it.

27:28.498 --> 27:31.126
But what you're trying to do,
it also comes with the burden

27:31.127 --> 27:35.296
of worry and shame and guilt
and constantly having to look

27:35.297 --> 27:37.632
over your shoulder for
the rest of your life.

27:37.633 --> 27:39.960
$25 million is a lot of money.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.089
But it cannot buy you peace of mind.

27:47.309 --> 27:49.220
I'm gonna go check on Mom.

27:59.072 --> 28:00.865
HELEN: Are you all right?

28:00.866 --> 28:02.115
Hmm?

28:02.116 --> 28:05.786
Well, you got my arm all up in
the air like I'm a scarecrow.

28:05.787 --> 28:07.196
Sorry, Mom.

28:08.707 --> 28:12.084
I don't know why you all
doing all this fussing over me.

28:12.085 --> 28:14.086
Oh, you fell.

28:14.087 --> 28:16.498
You treat me like I'm dying.

28:19.551 --> 28:21.218
Hmm.

28:21.219 --> 28:23.095
Did you get under the arm?

28:23.096 --> 28:24.840
MARY JANE: Oh.

28:31.312 --> 28:32.772
Can you stand, Mom?

28:32.773 --> 28:34.106
Yes, I can stand.

28:34.107 --> 28:37.602
Just get the towel and
dry me 'cause I'm cold.

28:40.113 --> 28:42.197
Oh...

28:42.198 --> 28:44.275
We're gonna have to turn the heat up.

28:48.371 --> 28:50.031
Thank you.

28:53.126 --> 28:55.586
Okay, okay, okay, I've got this.

28:55.587 --> 28:56.997
Okay.

29:00.049 --> 29:01.542
(GROANING)

29:16.065 --> 29:17.350
Thank you.

29:24.866 --> 29:26.199
(GROANING)

29:26.200 --> 29:28.076
What's wrong?

29:28.077 --> 29:29.202
My leg.

29:29.203 --> 29:30.663
Which one, Mom?

29:30.664 --> 29:32.164
Oh, this old right one.

29:32.165 --> 29:33.749

Yeah?

29:52.644 --> 29:55.304
You know, I always hated dancing.

29:56.189 --> 29:58.725
Well, I mean, I liked dancing, but...

29:59.943 --> 30:01.694
I thought I looked silly.

30:01.695 --> 30:04.522
I didn't want people to laugh at me, so,

30:05.281 --> 30:08.109
I never danced in public.

30:08.409 --> 30:10.077
Not even at our wedding.

30:10.078 --> 30:11.537
- No?
- Uh-uh.

30:11.538 --> 30:15.123

legs won't let me change my mind.

Well, for an older gal,
you've got great legs.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.737
Getting in a little overtime, huh?

32:08.738 --> 32:12.324
No, you know, I got off
early, so I did a little

32:12.325 --> 32:14.076
shopping.

32:14.077 --> 32:15.661
You just got your first check

So now you're not the only
fly Patterson in the family.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.584
(LAUGHING) Did I say that right, Niecy?

32:22.585 --> 32:24.954
Yeah, Grandpa, you said it right.

32:26.464 --> 32:27.798
What have you got?

32:27.799 --> 32:29.341
Okay, a Coach bag.

Uh, no, dumb.

It only cost $200

including this. Happy Birthday.

Baby, I don't want you
spending your money on me.

32:52.365 --> 32:54.033
How much was your check?

32:54.034 --> 32:56.785
It was $420 and I got commission

32:56.786 --> 32:58.578
and I did a little overtime this week.

32:58.579 --> 33:00.823
So, you spent half your check
on stuff you didn't need.

song always gonna be the same

33:06.546 --> 33:08.755

Yeah, when you realize the
whole point of you getting a job

was so that you could finally
take care of your responsibilities.

33:34.574 --> 33:37.659
Look, I felt the same way.

33:37.660 --> 33:41.413
But she needs to feel the
independence of the money.

33:41.414 --> 33:43.874
Look, you were the
same as a little girl.

33:43.875 --> 33:46.418
Well, as a little girl,
I didn't have kids.

33:46.419 --> 33:49.421
You know, I think it's time you
stopped punishing her for that.

33:49.422 --> 33:51.173
They're here.

33:51.174 --> 33:54.260
And maybe she didn't
do it the right way,

33:54.261 --> 33:56.004
but she's progressing.

33:56.804 --> 33:58.797
You... You think that's progress?

Can I be honest?

(LAUGHS) I don't think
that's ever been your issue.

34:11.444 --> 34:12.853
I had an abortion.

Pauletta...

34:16.489 --> 34:18.484
You did what?

34:21.829 --> 34:25.657
I did the... The
reasonable, responsible thing

34:26.458 --> 34:28.460
because I couldn't look at my Dad

34:28.460 --> 34:31.045
and have him see a burden,

34:31.047 --> 34:32.873
a pathetic burden.

34:35.842 --> 34:37.462
But...

34:38.471 --> 34:41.841
Now I see that if I
had just had the courage

34:43.476 --> 34:47.020
to come talk to you and Mom,
I could have done what Niecy

34:47.021 --> 34:49.397
and Patrick do,

34:49.398 --> 34:52.310
just let other people carry my load.

I... I could have had a...

A... A baby.

Who cares if... If
David wanted to marry me?

34:58.741 --> 35:00.826
Who cares if I could handle it.

35:00.827 --> 35:03.196
I've got my family, right?

35:04.331 --> 35:06.290
But, instead, I'm here,

35:06.291 --> 35:08.917
pissed that my whole entire family

35:08.918 --> 35:10.961
forgot my birthday and
I could have been home
