WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:04.136
<i>- Previously on</i> the strain...
- Looks like a dead animal.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.772
- There have been 200 people
sitting there silently,

00:06.774 --> 00:08.941
Absolutely no movement.
- Oh, my god...

00:08.943 --> 00:10.809
Are you seeing this?
- They're all dead.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.178
- No signs of struggle.
(gasping)

00:13.180 --> 00:15.514
- We've got survivors!
- I've seen this disease before.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.783
If you have the coffin,
then you still have him?

00:17.785 --> 00:21.653
- You will cross the bridge back
into manhattan before daybreak.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.288
You will be let through.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.957
- Seal off the perimeter
of the airport.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.226
- Got it. I said
let him through.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.529
(growling)

00:33.299 --> 00:36.235
- Ah!

00:46.312 --> 00:46.478
â™ª

01:33.526 --> 01:36.095
(meowing)

01:38.364 --> 01:40.332
(meowing)

01:43.203 --> 01:45.604
(making kissy sounds)

01:45.606 --> 01:48.340
- Hi. Mm-hmm!

02:09.229 --> 02:12.297
(rap song in spanish)

02:58.111 --> 03:02.147
- Hey yo, waxy boy!

03:02.149 --> 03:06.351
Waxy boy, I got your box!

03:06.353 --> 03:08.420
Oh!

03:25.371 --> 03:28.373
What you got there, white boy?

03:31.644 --> 03:34.479
(rumbling noise)

03:34.481 --> 03:37.216
(growling)

04:09.349 --> 04:12.417
(helicopter sound)

04:12.419 --> 04:15.220
- His lanyard says
his name is peter bishop,

04:15.222 --> 04:17.689
An atc supervisor. You knew him?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.691
- Where is his head?

04:19.693 --> 04:21.827
- That is his head.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.863
- I thought you guys were used
to shit like this.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.366
- He's not a doctor.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.534
It would take a lot of pressure

04:29.536 --> 04:31.870
To crush his skull like that.
What did this?

04:31.872 --> 04:34.773
- The tower said he came
down here with you.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.042
- He was helping us look for
a large cabinet

04:37.044 --> 04:39.044
From regis 753
that went missing.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.213
- What was in it?

04:41.215 --> 04:43.382
- We think it was some sort
of infectious agent.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.284
- You mean whatever killed
the people on that plane?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.686
- We don't know that.

04:48.888 --> 04:52.524
I mean, it's just a theory
at this point. Right?

04:54.227 --> 04:55.727
- Ammonia.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.398
Just like on the plane.
- Hey, one of you got an als?

04:59.400 --> 05:02.634
- Kill
the work lights.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.109
- What is that stuff?

05:11.111 --> 05:13.578
- Biological discharge.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.315
- Closest analogue is guano.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.418
That or tick shit.
- That's one hell of a tick.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.253
(cell phone ringing)

05:21.255 --> 05:23.422
- Goodweather.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.758
- Jim, what's the
matter with you?

05:26.760 --> 05:29.761
- Long night. No sleep.
Maybe too much coffee.

05:29.763 --> 05:33.598
- Goddamn it! I don't care
what he said! Just stall them.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.600
Lose their clothes. I don't
care, just keep them there

05:35.602 --> 05:37.669
Till we get there.
We have to go.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.105
This crime scene is now
under cdc authority.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.107
Nobody touches that body.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.376
Barnes just released
the four survivors.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.454
- You don't need a cab.
My driver will drop you off.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.290
- I'm sorry, folks, but you're
not going anywhere.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.791
- Spare yourself
the crucifixion.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.460
You don't have a chance in hell
of making that stick.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.828
- You still think
it's some super flu, doc?

06:02.830 --> 06:05.630
- Haven't you seen the news?

06:05.632 --> 06:07.632
- Someone leaked the regis air
documents to the internet.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.635
It's carbon monoxide poisoning.
All of it covered up

06:10.637 --> 06:12.637
By the airline's ceo,
daniel flaxton.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.639
You should be relieved, doctor.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.808
It's out of your hands.
Now if you don't mind,

06:16.810 --> 06:20.379
I've got a lawsuit to file.
- You believe everything on tv?

06:20.381 --> 06:23.315
- Holy jesus, is this man
annoying. We're fine.

06:23.317 --> 06:26.051
We're all fine.
No thanks to you, doc.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.653
- Feeling fine at this moment
does not mean you're not sick.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.188
- Diseases incubate.
- Look, I get it.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.491
This is your time
in the spotlight.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.226
To snag a promotion.
Love to help,

06:34.228 --> 06:36.895
But I've got a major concert on
the day of the eclipse, so...

06:38.331 --> 06:40.165
- I need to go. I do.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.501
- If it were up to me, I'd stay,

06:42.503 --> 06:44.503
But my union lawyers
want me out, so...

06:44.505 --> 06:46.505
- We're going around in circles
here. Let me be very clear:

06:46.507 --> 06:49.741
You're all staying here under
quarantine on my authority.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.746
- Director barnes said
we would be released.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.182
- And I say you stay.
I don't care what barnes said.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.917
According to the health
powers act,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.919
It only takes two physicians
to issue a quarantine order.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.022
- It's on. One phone call,
I get your job.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.758
And little miss muffet's.
- You better start dialing then.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.595
- Dialing. Katie, it's joan.
Get me the secretary of health

07:10.597 --> 07:12.597
And human services,
margaret pierson.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.599
<i>- At a press conference</i>
<i>last night,</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:17.202
<i>Dr. Ephraim goodweather,</i>
<i>chief medical officer</i>

07:17.204 --> 07:20.205
<i>With the centers for disease</i>
<i>control in new york city,</i>

07:20.207 --> 07:21.940
<i>Said it was too early</i>

07:21.942 --> 07:24.443
<i>In his investigation--</i>
<i>- this could be a problem.</i>

07:27.213 --> 07:29.581
The cdc has closed the airport.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.050
They have still not released
the survivors.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.786
If they continue to
treat this as an epidemic,

07:34.788 --> 07:38.223
It will delay our timetable.
- In an hour,

07:38.225 --> 07:40.592
Nobody will be talking
about an epidemic.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.562
And I'll have the four
survivors on the street.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.430
- You will accomplish this how?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.266
- Disinformation.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.403
A good story always
trumps the truth.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.805
Just give the press
a villain to hate.

07:55.575 --> 07:59.411
Now that this is done,

07:59.413 --> 08:02.247
When do I see him?

08:02.249 --> 08:04.249
- Soon.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.952
- He's across the river.
That was our deal.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.921
- You will see him soon.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.156
- Where are you going?

08:13.459 --> 08:15.594
- To see an old friend.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.663
<i>- I personally read</i>
<i>all 250 pages</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:21.099
<i>Of the regis documents.</i>

08:21.101 --> 08:23.802
<i>And I was shocked and sickened</i>

08:23.804 --> 08:26.271
<i>By the airline's</i>
<i>flagrant disregard</i>

08:26.273 --> 08:28.673
<i>For the safety</i>
<i>of its passengers.</i>

08:30.443 --> 08:32.444
- Abraham setrakian.

08:32.446 --> 08:34.112
Your lawyer's here to see you.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.848
- I have no lawyer.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.323
- You've grown old,

09:18.325 --> 09:20.892
A230385.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.995
- Eichorst...

09:23.997 --> 09:27.566
- Surprised to see me?
- It has been many years.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.836
You look exactly the same.

09:31.838 --> 09:35.040
- Your heartbeat is irregular.
I can hear it, jew,

09:35.042 --> 09:37.509
Clear as a bell.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.911
- Did the coffin
cross the river?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.080
- What do you think?

09:44.183 --> 09:46.718
- And where is your master now?

09:46.720 --> 09:50.355
- Watching you through me.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.592
The great game is over, jew.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.762
- Not while
I still breathe.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.931
- Amazing.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.369
Despite all evidence
to the contrary,

10:04.371 --> 10:06.738
You cling to the delusion

10:06.740 --> 10:08.740
That you will prevail.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.376
Don't tell me
you still believe

10:11.378 --> 10:13.378
In that god of yours.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.380
So where is he?

10:15.382 --> 10:17.649
Why has he done nothing?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.553
Face the truth.

10:21.555 --> 10:25.123
He is nothing but a figment
of your imagination.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.629
Your arrest report
says you were apprehended

10:30.631 --> 10:33.231
With an antique sword.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.967
Is it sardu's?
- Don't worry.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.573
I will give it back to
your master in due time.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.409
- That is amusing.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.578
And her heart...

10:46.580 --> 10:48.980
Do you still
have that as well?

10:51.917 --> 10:56.221
Oh, you are such
a sentimentalist.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.258
You might like
to know this.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.094
She struggled
at the very end,

11:03.096 --> 11:05.096
But she never cried out.

11:05.098 --> 11:09.100
I thought that strange.
Not even a whimper.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.936
Only a single word.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.106
"abraham."

11:15.108 --> 11:17.175
But you were not there

11:17.177 --> 11:19.310
To help her.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.113
Do you feel great regret?

11:22.115 --> 11:25.150
- I will avenge her.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.452
- You will not
avenge anyone.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.621
You're not a hero or a savior.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.623
You're just a number.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.693
I took your name
and gave you that number.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.028
That's all you are.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.705
It's good for you
that you are in here.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.641
It's the only place
you can feel safe.

11:49.643 --> 11:53.511
Safer than the streets
will be very soon.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.314
You might survive

11:56.316 --> 11:59.184
A little longer.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.985
I want you

12:00.987 --> 12:04.656
To watch it unfold,
unable to do anything

12:04.658 --> 12:07.425
To stop it.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.665
And when you die,

12:13.667 --> 12:16.067
It will be the master's eyes

12:16.069 --> 12:18.236
You see last...

12:18.238 --> 12:21.673
- Remember
your old friend,

12:21.675 --> 12:24.242
Dreverhaven?

12:26.545 --> 12:28.546
Would you like
to know why

12:28.548 --> 12:32.083
He isn't here to share
your glory with you?

12:34.019 --> 12:37.756
Because I cut him to pieces
with that sword

12:37.758 --> 12:40.091
And dumped his parts

12:40.093 --> 12:42.193
In the north sea.

12:42.195 --> 12:46.264
I'll see that you're
reunited with him

12:46.266 --> 12:50.935
Very soon.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.274
- Until next time...

12:58.210 --> 13:02.814
A230385.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.303
(news bulletin on tv)

13:25.305 --> 13:27.305
(door opening)

13:31.410 --> 13:33.778
- Mama, I'm home!

13:33.780 --> 13:36.314
- She's getting ready for mass.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.420
- Why don't you
clean your shit up?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.322
- Shh! Listen.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.992
Plane coming in with
those stiffs on it?
- What did I say?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.794
Huh?

13:49.796 --> 13:52.597
You think I'm playing with you?
- Hola, mijo.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.099
- Hola, mami!

13:55.101 --> 13:57.969
Como estas? Mira, que linda!
You look beautiful.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.805
- You look... Terrible.

14:00.807 --> 14:03.808
Oh, mijo. I don't like you

14:03.810 --> 14:06.778
Working nights like this.
It's not good for you.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
- I know.
- Come to mass with me.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.682
Father cortez has been
asking about you.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.451
- I can't, mama,
I gotta get some sleep.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.087
Next week.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.624
- Did you see
what crispin got me?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.626
- No, I didn't see it.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.628
(chuckling excitedly)

14:23.630 --> 14:25.630
Wow...

14:25.632 --> 14:27.832
That's a nice piece.
Where'd you get it, bro?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.968
- Flea market.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.303
Was a real steal. Old lady
didn't know what she had.

14:32.305 --> 14:36.808
- So good to have
my two kids together again.

14:36.810 --> 14:40.645
You both will be here
for dinner?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.648
- Si, mama.
- I'll make something special.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.483
- Ok.
- Bye!

14:45.485 --> 14:48.386
- Bye, mommy, I love you.
- I love you too!

14:54.827 --> 14:58.329
- Where'd you
get it? Huh?

14:58.331 --> 15:01.666
Where d'you get it? The truth,
you junkie piece of shit!

15:01.668 --> 15:03.534
Huh? Huh?

15:03.536 --> 15:07.205
- The pawn shop a couple blocks
down! The jew who buys silver.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.840
- You don't bring stolen shit
into this house

15:08.842 --> 15:10.508
And involve mom on it.
- Ok!

15:10.510 --> 15:12.911
- You hear me?
- Yes!

15:18.017 --> 15:20.385
You know, gus,
you got some balls

15:20.387 --> 15:22.687
Talking to me
like that.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.422
Two years.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.691
Two years I listened to her
cry herself to sleep at night

15:26.693 --> 15:28.192
While you were upstate.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.361
I was the only one
who was here for her!

15:30.363 --> 15:32.697
- You were shooting
her paychecks up your arm.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.199
- Ok, you got me.
- Yeah, I got you.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.902
- Ok. But what about
you, gus, huh?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.537
- What about me?
- How you long is it gonna be

15:39.539 --> 15:43.708
Before you get busted again
and break her heart? Huh?

15:43.710 --> 15:46.177
- I'm taking this clock back.

15:48.380 --> 15:52.383
- That's not gonna
wash you clean, altar boy!

15:52.385 --> 15:53.885
- You contradicted
my explicit orders

15:53.887 --> 15:55.920
And declared them quarantined.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.221
- You can't release
those survivors.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.723
- Not till we know
what we're facing.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.425
- We do know.
Let me introduce you

16:00.427 --> 16:02.260
To the secretary of health
and human services,

16:02.262 --> 16:03.394
- Margaret pierson.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.229
- Pleasure to meet you,
dr. Goodweather.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.733
Dr. Martinez. Let me bring you
both up to speed.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.902
These regis air documents

16:10.904 --> 16:14.405
Point to a systems failure
aboard flight 753.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.909
So I've had the faa ground
the entire regis airline fleet

16:17.911 --> 16:20.111
Until the ntsb completes
its investigation.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.946
It's not a cdc case anymore.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.650
The ntsb
has the ball now.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.251
- With all due respect,
madam secretary,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.253
These people didn't die
from a faulty air system.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.589
- They didn't?
- Everything in my investigation

16:31.591 --> 16:33.424
Points to a virulent pathogen.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.426
We're far from understanding
exactly what did happen,

16:35.428 --> 16:38.262
But we need to shut down this
airport so it doesn't spread.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.431
- Eph, please.
- Dr. Goodweather,

16:40.433 --> 16:42.100
I appreciate your zeal.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.102
But you need to step back
for a moment and consider

16:44.104 --> 16:46.137
The impact of
a medical quarantine.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.840
It would immediately
stop all exports

16:48.842 --> 16:51.109
From new york to
the rest of the world.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.311
Do you want to crash
a $70 billion economy

16:53.313 --> 16:56.280
And send the stock markets
into a free fall on a hunch?

16:56.282 --> 16:58.116
- Eph, I know you've been
under a lot of stress

16:58.118 --> 16:59.650
In your personal life,
that's a big part of the cause.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.286
But don't bring your baggage--
- my personal life

17:02.288 --> 17:04.155
Has nothing to do with this.
It's about saving people.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.859
It's that simple.
- Eph...

17:07.861 --> 17:09.627
- Sorry, everett. I shouldn't
have done that.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.863
- No, you shouldn't have.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.464
Here's what's going to happen.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.466
You're going to take
a few days off.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.802
Then once this all blows over,
we're going to revisit

17:17.804 --> 17:19.637
Your situation.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.207
But as of now, you are
no longer involved.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.276
Go home.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.318
- [you've reached the office]

17:34.320 --> 17:36.054
[of the chief medical examiner
of new york city.]

17:36.056 --> 17:37.889
[no one is available to take--]

17:37.891 --> 17:39.690
- I can't reach bennett,
or anybody.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.693
Why aren't they picking up
at the coroner's office?

17:42.695 --> 17:45.430
- They got 206 dead bodies,
they're probably a little busy.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.834
(soft music playing)

17:49.836 --> 17:52.737
(news bulletin on tv)

18:01.513 --> 18:04.749
- Captain redfern? Thanks
for agreeing to meet us.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.717
- You bet.

18:06.719 --> 18:10.354
My passengers and crew trusted
me to get them to jfk safely.

18:10.356 --> 18:14.092
But I didn't.
I'd like to know why.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.861
- You look a little pale.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.863
- I'm ok. A bit
of a headache.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.532
There's that humming in my ears.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.535
- We do have a non-medical
question for you.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.405
A large piece of cargo has gone
missing from the plane.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.641
- The box.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.378
- You know about the box?

18:34.380 --> 18:37.715
- I was doing my pre-flight
walk around on the plane.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.951
Four officials in suits show up

18:39.953 --> 18:42.553
In a government van
with this huge crate.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.723
We've carried last-minute high-
security cargo in the past,

18:45.725 --> 18:47.558
So I didn't think
much of it.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.294
- This box, it was maybe
nine foot by four foot?

18:50.296 --> 18:52.396
- Yes.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.565
- Do you know what government
office? Who they were?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.969
- They got down onto
the tarmac to my plane,

18:57.971 --> 18:59.971
They had suits
and badges...

18:59.973 --> 19:02.306
I figured it had
to be official.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.909
Who am I to question this?

19:04.911 --> 19:07.912
But because I didn't,

19:07.914 --> 19:10.148
206 people are dead.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.416
- Other people are still in
danger. You can help save them.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.586
Here's what you can do:
Go to the emergency room

19:15.588 --> 19:17.421
At st. Sebastian's.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.924
A dr. William lester
will meet you there.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.293
- Who's he?

19:22.295 --> 19:24.428
- He's the best
diagnostician I know.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.931
He'll admit you
as a private patient,

19:26.933 --> 19:28.799
As a favor to me,
and run some tests.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.769
He'll find out what's causing
the sound in your ears

19:31.771 --> 19:33.504
And your headaches.
- Ok.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.611
Unbelievable. Jumping
through all these hoops

19:40.613 --> 19:43.848
Because those bastards don't
want to face a quarantine.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.952
And the airline's worried
about their liability,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.154
My union is worried
about theirs--

19:50.156 --> 19:52.156
Everyone's first priority

19:52.158 --> 19:54.458
Is covering their asses.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.627
And no one gives a shit
about the truth.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.163
- I do, and you do,

19:59.165 --> 20:02.166
And that's the best shot
we've got right now.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.469
- Oh, my god...

20:05.471 --> 20:08.639
Its buccal cavity
has serrated projections.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.042
- So it can latch onto
or cut through tissue.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.711
I want to try something.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.483
- Make it quick.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.185
Before someone asks what
the hell we're doing here.

20:21.187 --> 20:24.822
- If these worms
did infect the victims,

20:24.824 --> 20:27.592
Then human blood should
produce a tropic reaction.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.403
Look at that...

20:46.011 --> 20:50.748
(beeping)

20:53.518 --> 20:55.219
It's zack. I'm supposed to stop
by to talk about

20:55.221 --> 20:58.022
The custody hearing.
- You better go then.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.924
- No, this is important.
He'll understand.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.560
- He'll understand he's not
as important as your work,

21:02.562 --> 21:05.196
Which is exactly what he hears
from his mother every day.

21:05.198 --> 21:07.031
You want the judge to give kelly
full custody?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.033
- Of course not.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.502
- Take a moment.

21:13.538 --> 21:16.040
Redfern's test results won't
come in for a couple of hours.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.943
I'll finish this.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.612
- Thank you.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.697
See you at the hospital.

21:45.904 --> 21:48.806
(loud music)

21:51.643 --> 21:53.811
- What are you doing in here?
- Vasiliy fet.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.081
Inspector, city pest control.
- On a Sunday?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.417
No! You're not doing
an inspection now.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.452
There's no time-- this is
our champagne brunch.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.587
Busiest service
of the week.

22:03.589 --> 22:07.091
- Sorry. We had a complaint.
- You want breakfast?

22:07.093 --> 22:09.427
Give the order to one
of the line chefs.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.330
But I am not
giving you any cash.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.932
- Is that what you think
I'm here for?

22:14.934 --> 22:17.601
Ha! Look.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.437
You see that?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.439
That's rat urine.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.508
- Ridiculous! Ok,

22:24.510 --> 22:27.778
Two hundred dollars, but you get
the hell out of here right now.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.282
- No.
- You're making a big mistake.

22:31.284 --> 22:34.018
- I make many mistakes,
but not about vermin.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.523
Move.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.128
- That was a $300,000 offer

22:44.130 --> 22:46.297
For a 30-minute
on-camera interview.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.132
- And you hang up?!
- Whatever they're offering,

22:48.134 --> 22:49.867
It's gonna be chump change

22:49.869 --> 22:51.869
Compared to what we'll get
from the airline.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.139
- This may go in the category
of "too soon,"

22:55.141 --> 22:56.507
But ticket sales are way up.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.876
- That's what I love
about you, ruby.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.979
Here's to being alive.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.882
Moments like this...
As an artist,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.684
They make you take a step back

23:06.686 --> 23:09.487
And look at the big picture.
- There's no answer

23:09.489 --> 23:12.923
To "why us." it's just
random luck, but I'll take it.

23:19.498 --> 23:23.401
(whirring sound)
- there's that... Hum again.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.003
You hear it still,
don't you?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.005
- It's almost like an echo.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.841
Like an echo
of a voice,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.544
Maybe your own voice, when
your ears and nose are stuffed.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.846
- It's weird.
- I'm not hearing it,

23:35.848 --> 23:38.749
But gabe, if that voice
has a tune, write it down.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.919
- Reminds me of
my first acid trip.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.890
You ever done acid, joan?

23:45.892 --> 23:47.892
- Nope, no acid.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.860
Not my thing.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.695
- What is your thing?

23:51.697 --> 23:54.031
You want to take this party
someplace else?

23:54.033 --> 23:55.399
- Like?

23:55.401 --> 23:57.701
- Townhouse above
my new theater.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.537
We can celebrate

23:59.539 --> 24:02.106
Our escape
from the abyss.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.221
- No, I better get home

24:17.223 --> 24:19.890
And see my kids. And my husband.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.759
- Maybe another time?

24:21.761 --> 24:24.728
- I'm going to be getting
together our legal team

24:24.730 --> 24:27.465
At the firm tomorrow.
We'll talk soon, gabe.

24:29.568 --> 24:33.270
- I need to get my pipes
cleaned, ruby.

24:33.272 --> 24:36.640
Pick out a couple
of hot ones.

24:43.582 --> 24:46.250
- Everyone stop
what they're doing.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.452
No more food goes out
of the kitchen.

24:48.454 --> 24:50.754
As of right now,
you start cleaning...

24:50.756 --> 24:53.257
If you ever want this place
to open up again.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.758
- You can't shut us down!

24:54.760 --> 24:57.628
Councilwoman shankar eats
here every Wednesday.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.831
- Oh yeah? You gonna
serve her this?

25:02.267 --> 25:04.168
Attention, everybody!

25:04.170 --> 25:06.971
By order of the health
department, this establishment

25:06.973 --> 25:09.473
Is now closed. All right?

25:09.475 --> 25:12.977
Everyone must leave.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.912
Let's go.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.487
Hey, hon.
(screaming)

25:23.489 --> 25:27.658
(all screaming)
time to go!

25:27.660 --> 25:30.461
- I'm guessing
we don't have to pay.

25:30.463 --> 25:33.664
(screaming)

25:33.666 --> 25:37.134
- Dr. Moise called with
some good news, sir.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.304
The liver's young and healthy.
It belongs to a laborer.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.805
No family. He won't be missed.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.474
Moise would like to move
ahead with the acquisition.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.709
- I'm not sure
I'll need it anymore.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.711
- With all due respect, sir,

25:47.713 --> 25:50.314
If these other people can't
deliver what they've promised--

25:50.316 --> 25:52.816
- They can.
And they will.

25:52.818 --> 25:56.520
- Even so, you should
have a backup.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.056
Keep in mind: It's a five-hour
flight to bogota.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.325
Minimum of eight hours
to harvest the organ.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.993
Five more to return.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.529
Your liver functionality
is already well below normal.

26:05.531 --> 26:08.532
It could fail at any time.
If it does fail,

26:08.534 --> 26:10.534
It will be a challenge
to keep you alive

26:10.536 --> 26:12.536
Until we receive
the replacement.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.506
- All right. Fine.

26:15.508 --> 26:18.342
Do it.
- I'm not sure it's wise

26:18.344 --> 26:20.077
To leave the building, sir.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.346
An infection would--
- would adversely affect

26:22.348 --> 26:24.682
My ability
to withstand surgery.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.585
Yes, yes, yes. I'm going.

26:27.587 --> 26:30.020
There is no debate.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.190
In fact, I've never felt
more excited about a meeting

26:33.192 --> 26:36.760
In my entire life.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.040
- I agree, nora: 101 degrees
is not cause for alarm,

26:50.042 --> 26:53.777
But I don't like that
his temperature's rising.

26:55.246 --> 26:57.548
Fine. I'll meet you back
at the hospital by the time

26:57.550 --> 27:00.951
Redfern's path report gets back.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.556
Good.

27:05.558 --> 27:09.093
Talk soon. Sorry.

27:09.095 --> 27:12.296
It's the airplane case.
- Yeah, I've been watching.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.098
But why are you involved?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.100
They say something was wrong
with the plane.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.302
- That's total bullshit. Nobody
wants to deal with the truth.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.104
- What is it?

27:20.106 --> 27:22.306
- I don't know.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.408
Nothing's adding up.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.411
- That's scary.
- It is.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.747
- Well, I'm glad
you're handling it.

27:29.749 --> 27:33.917
That means whatever needs
to be done will get done.

27:33.919 --> 27:36.253
- Thank you.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.922
- Oh, come in.

27:38.924 --> 27:42.026
Matt's here.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.665
- Hey, eph.
- Hey--

27:47.667 --> 27:51.101
- Diane. My name's diane.
I've met you, like,

27:51.103 --> 27:53.103
Five times. I drive your kid
to school every other day,

27:53.105 --> 27:55.105
And you can't even
remember my name.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.274
- I remember your name, diane.
I just drew a blank.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.809
- Funny, I've never drawn
a blank about you.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.778
Not once. Why is that, eph?

28:00.780 --> 28:03.614
- Diane. Zack's in the back,

28:03.616 --> 28:06.450
Helping matt.
- Do what?

28:06.452 --> 28:08.452
- We're converting
your old office

28:08.454 --> 28:10.888
Into a game room.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.630
- Hey, dad.

28:19.632 --> 28:22.800
- Hey, zack.
- How's it going, eph?

28:22.802 --> 28:24.868
- Ok.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.138
So you're rebuilding
this place, huh?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.974
- Yeah. Giant screen tv

28:30.976 --> 28:33.544
Over here. Perfect size
for a room like this.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.479
Speakers here,
and here.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.315
This'll be a great
new space for us.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.652
- Listen... I know
this is awkward,

28:41.654 --> 28:43.987
But I don't
want it to be.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.723
Um...

28:45.725 --> 28:48.826
Just make her happy.

28:48.828 --> 28:52.196
Just make them happy.
That's all I ask.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.566
- You got it.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.669
- Oh. Oh, ok.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.671
Great.

29:00.673 --> 29:02.840
Mind if I speak
with my son?

29:02.842 --> 29:06.176
- No, of course.
You know, in time,

29:06.178 --> 29:10.080
I bet you and I will
become good friends.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.882
- Maybe.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.884
Hey, zack, zack, I gotta go.

29:13.886 --> 29:17.588
- Because of that plane. I know.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.590
- I wanted to talk about

29:19.592 --> 29:21.692
The custody hearing tomorrow.
- Ok.

29:21.694 --> 29:24.695
Just don't be late.
- I won't. I won't be.

29:24.697 --> 29:27.698
I mean it.
- So what about it?

29:27.700 --> 29:29.900
- Uh...

29:29.902 --> 29:32.903
It is a weird situation,
huh, for all of us?

29:32.905 --> 29:35.906
- Mom says the judge will ask
all kinds of questions.

29:35.908 --> 29:39.042
- Yeah, he will. Or she will.
Whoever it is, they will.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.546
Have you thought about
what you were gonna say?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.448
- Mom says I should just
say how I feel.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.250
- Absolutely. Just be honest,
just speak from your heart.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.052
- What are you gonna say?
- Me? Same thing.

29:49.054 --> 29:51.555
My feelings.
I'm gonna say

29:51.557 --> 29:53.557
You're the most
important person

29:53.559 --> 29:55.926
In the world to me,
because you are,

29:55.928 --> 29:58.796
And that I want joint custody.
- What's that?

29:58.798 --> 30:01.565
- That means...

30:01.567 --> 30:03.634
That you get to spend
as much time with me

30:03.636 --> 30:05.569
As you do with your mother.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.571
And I know that's
what you want, right?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.406
- Yeah... But if
you're always so busy...

30:09.408 --> 30:11.408
- I won't be, not after
I put this case to bed.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.912
- You always say that.
And I know you mean it,

30:14.914 --> 30:18.482
But it's never true.
- Zack, zack, look at me...

30:18.484 --> 30:20.751
This time,

30:20.753 --> 30:24.488
It will be.

30:41.139 --> 30:44.308
- I didn't think
you were gonna show.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.844
Keeping
commitments is--

30:46.846 --> 30:51.181
- Is part of
my recovery process.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.976
Hi, my name's eph.

31:18.978 --> 31:23.013
I'm an alcoholic.
(greetings)

31:23.015 --> 31:25.649
I've been sober one year

31:25.651 --> 31:28.218
And eleven days.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.388
I'm in therapy.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.057
Learning about myself.

31:34.059 --> 31:37.194
It's a journey
of discovery. Uh...

31:37.196 --> 31:40.564
I'm passive-aggressive
and actively aggressive,

31:40.566 --> 31:43.567
Which is a rare
combination, I'm told.

31:43.569 --> 31:47.571
Let's see, what else? I'm
controlling. I'm self-centered.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.040
I'm emotionally distant
for my family.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.242
Oh, and the greatest sin of all:

31:52.244 --> 31:54.344
I love my work.

31:54.346 --> 31:58.115
But I'm taking it all in,
you know, I'm owning it.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.520
And it's really making
a difference.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.023
My wife's divorcing me,

32:06.025 --> 32:09.026
And screwing this new dude...

32:09.028 --> 32:11.228
In my bed. In my house,

32:11.230 --> 32:13.931
On which I'm still
making payments.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.069
There I go again, right,
richard? My sponsor says

32:19.071 --> 32:21.371
That I use sarcasm
to avoid my real feelings,

32:21.373 --> 32:24.708
That if I truly loved kelly,
I would be happy for her,

32:24.710 --> 32:27.344
I wouldn't resent her...

32:29.547 --> 32:32.115
I'm trying, richard.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.118
But it is a very steep hill.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.723
I saw them right before
I came here.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.959
All three
of them together.

32:43.728 --> 32:46.797
Doing things I never
had time to do,

32:46.799 --> 32:49.900
Still don't have time to do...

32:49.902 --> 32:52.135
I wanted a drink.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.439
I passed a bar
after I left there.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.475
But I came here.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.749
Because I can't
blow it with zack.

33:05.751 --> 33:09.519
Because he is all
that I have left.

33:15.626 --> 33:18.195
He's my whole world.

33:27.271 --> 33:30.340
(applause)

33:35.847 --> 33:39.516
(muffled music)

33:50.495 --> 33:53.697
(hard rock music)

33:53.699 --> 33:56.299
- Are you ready
to party with me?

33:56.301 --> 33:58.535
- Yeah!

33:58.537 --> 34:01.371
(giggling)

34:09.180 --> 34:11.715
- You smell beautiful.
I bet you taste even better.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.057
- You okay, gabe?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.324
I'm still on german time.

34:21.326 --> 34:25.395
Keep the beat going.
I'll catch up.

34:31.502 --> 34:34.638
(sound of blood pumping)

34:41.846 --> 34:45.382
(screaming)
- you bit me, you bastard!

34:45.384 --> 34:48.685
- Bullshit.
- I'm bleeding. He bit me hard!

34:48.687 --> 34:50.687
- Get out.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.256
Get out! Out!

34:54.725 --> 34:58.428
Out!
- You're crazy!

35:09.040 --> 35:13.276
(sound of blood pumping)

35:21.085 --> 35:23.420
- What's wrong?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.055
- Redfern just went
into a tailspin.

35:25.057 --> 35:26.223
- Lester's with him.
Here's the path report.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.625
I've never seen
anything like it.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.763
- This is crazy:
Aberrant, foreign cells...

35:33.765 --> 35:36.233
Nuclear pleomorphism.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.435
Biphenotypic appearance...
It's like something

35:38.437 --> 35:40.437
Shanghaied his cellular
machinery

35:40.439 --> 35:42.405
And is creating something
totally different.

35:42.407 --> 35:45.575
- We've sedated him for the
pain, started fluids, but...

35:45.577 --> 35:47.911
- Antibody studies back in yet?
- No.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.747
- How you feeling, doyle?
- Boiling.

35:50.749 --> 35:54.718
Skin's crawling. I feel
like I swallowed a razor.
- Uv light.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.322
Watch your eyes.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.760
A scar. Same place
as the airline victims.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.095
It just healed so fast

36:05.097 --> 36:06.663
We couldn't see it
without uv light.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.731
- Eph, look!

36:15.339 --> 36:17.340
- Jim, find barnes. Tell him
that redfern's gone critical.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.942
- He's gonna be really pissed
when he finds out

36:18.944 --> 36:21.111
You've been treating him.
- I don't give a shit! Tell him

36:21.113 --> 36:22.612
That one of the survivors
is very sick.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.114
Tell him we need to corral
the rest of the survivors

36:24.116 --> 36:25.782
And anybody they've had
contact with.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.517
Now.
- Yes, sir.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.119
- The autopsies should have
turned something up by now.

36:29.121 --> 36:30.854
- Dr. Bennett
is still not answering.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.489
It went straight
to voice mail again.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.691
- Well, if the mountain
won't come to mahomet...

36:34.693 --> 36:36.493
We're going
to the morgue.

36:36.495 --> 36:40.130
- [dr. Goodweather? This is
laurie from the cdc exchange.]

36:40.132 --> 36:42.866
[there's a gary arnot calling.]
- yeah, ok.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.001
Hello?
- [yes, doctor,]

36:45.003 --> 36:46.503
This is gary arnot.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.972
[I'm emma's--]
- I know who you are, mr. Arnot.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.308
- [first of all,
I just wanted to say]

36:51.310 --> 36:53.510
That I'm sorry for what I did,

36:53.512 --> 36:56.313
And to thank you for sending
my little girl home to me.

36:56.315 --> 37:00.817
- What? Are you saying someone
released her body to you?

37:00.819 --> 37:02.552
- No, not her body.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.155
Emma's alive. She showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

37:05.157 --> 37:08.158
- Uh, mr. Arnot,
I'm a little confused.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.327
Are you telling me--
- you don't believe me?

37:10.329 --> 37:11.828
[you know what? Fine, whatever.]

37:11.830 --> 37:14.497
- I'm just trying to--
- [my daughter's home safe.]

37:14.499 --> 37:16.733
That's all that matters.
Thank you very much.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.870
- Do you think
it's possible she's alive?

37:20.872 --> 37:22.339
- He's in shock.
He's seeing ghosts.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.674
I examined her
in her seat, she's dead.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.209
- When we boarded that plane,
everybody looked dead.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.911
Then four of them woke up.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.881
Could these worms somehow induce

37:31.883 --> 37:34.184
Some sort of state
of hibernation?

37:34.186 --> 37:36.419
Like tsetse
flies?

37:36.421 --> 37:38.688
- We'll find out in ten minutes.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.957
If she's dead, she'll be
at the morgue.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.901
- Sir?

37:51.903 --> 37:53.403
I know you don't wanna
hear this,

37:53.405 --> 37:55.238
But I've been with you
a long time and listened

37:55.240 --> 37:58.708
To a lot of doctors
promise you a lot of things.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.244
I've seen what can be done
and what can't.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.881
These people...
They're deceiving you.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.917
- These people have power

38:07.919 --> 38:10.587
Beyond anything you can imagine.

38:10.589 --> 38:14.858
In time, you also will
benefit from that power.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.795
Stay with the car.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.865
I need to do this alone.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.911
- The sun
has fallen.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.849
You are very fortunate,
mr. Palmer.

39:14.819 --> 39:18.855
He has chosen you to bear
witness to his glory.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.700
(growling)

39:33.003 --> 39:38.041
- Welcome to the new world.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.877
- You brought me
all the way here.

39:45.483 --> 39:48.585
Aren't you going
to look at me?

40:07.671 --> 40:10.507
(whimpering)

40:10.509 --> 40:14.711
(creature growling)

40:14.713 --> 40:18.415
- Hello? Anybody here?
(phones ringing)

40:25.389 --> 40:28.024
Dr. Bennett?

40:28.026 --> 40:31.928
Dr. Bennett, you ok?

40:49.079 --> 40:51.614
Hello?

40:53.884 --> 40:57.787
(clanking)

41:04.395 --> 41:08.031
- Every bag is empty.
Every single one.
