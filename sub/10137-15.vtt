It's just a test.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.953
What, did you guys

07:31.618 --> 07:32.953
rehearse that?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.955
(together)

07:32.994 --> 07:34.955
Oh, no, not at all.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.248
- Hey, everybody.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.248
- Hi!

07:36.290 --> 07:37.958
- How you doing?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.958
- Hi, Deej.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.918
Hey, Deej, listen, I just read

07:37.999 --> 07:39.918
this article that said

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
if you listen to Mozart,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.795
it can raise your IQ

07:41.836 --> 07:43.588
by like-like ten points.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.132
Steve, she doesn't

07:43.630 --> 07:45.132
need any CDs.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.174
Look, it's no big deal.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.884
- It's--

07:46.216 --> 07:47.884
- It's just a test.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.678
Actually I was gonna say,

07:47.926 --> 07:50.678
it's simply an examination but..

07:50.720 --> 07:51.846
[doorbell ringing]

07:51.888 --> 07:53.556
I'll get it.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.519
[doorbell ringing]

08:00.563 --> 08:01.773
Yes, can I help you?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.358
There he is!

08:03.400 --> 08:05.944
That's the beast that's been

08:03.400 --> 08:05.944
barking at my Anastasia.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.864
Look, D.J., I swear, I don't

08:07.654 --> 08:09.864
even know an Anastasia.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.159
I don't know what

08:09.906 --> 08:12.159
she's talking about.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.412
Not you.

08:15.454 --> 08:18.290
I'm talking about

08:15.454 --> 08:18.290
that...that devil dog!

08:22.669 --> 08:25.088
Every time we walk

08:22.669 --> 08:25.088
by your yard, he barks.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.341
Scared my little girl

08:25.130 --> 08:27.341
half to death.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.677
I'm sorry, but you

08:28.508 --> 08:30.677
must be mistaken.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.514
Comet is the kindest, gentlest,

08:30.718 --> 08:34.514
most harmless dog in the world.

08:34.555 --> 08:36.224
I am telling you

08:34.555 --> 08:36.224
that dog's barking

08:36.266 --> 08:37.809
is ruining

08:36.266 --> 08:37.809
the neighborhood.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.021
Look, lady, nobody

08:37.851 --> 08:41.021
in this family barks!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.900
Well, now we see

08:43.523 --> 08:45.900
where he gets it.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.531
Uh, Deej, you gotta

08:49.654 --> 08:51.531
calm down.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.533
Well, this test

08:51.572 --> 08:53.533
is driving me crazy!

08:53.574 --> 08:55.285
I know, look, I know

08:53.574 --> 08:55.285
it's a lot of pressure

08:55.327 --> 08:56.577
on you, but don't worry

08:55.327 --> 08:56.577
about it.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
I mean, hey,

08:56.619 --> 08:58.163
I'll still love you

08:58.205 --> 09:01.208
even if the only thing

08:58.205 --> 09:01.208
you get right's your name.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.335
Maybe I should write it

09:01.249 --> 09:03.335
on my hand, just in case.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.307
[whistling]

09:17.349 --> 09:19.059
Michelle,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.059
what are you doing?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
Safety violation!

09:20.601 --> 09:22.687
What-what happened?

09:20.601 --> 09:22.687
What did I do?

09:22.729 --> 09:25.732
Sleeping too close

09:22.729 --> 09:25.732
to a pencil.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.692
You can poke an eye out.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.652
Michelle, I have a test

09:27.734 --> 09:29.652
tomorrow morning!

09:29.694 --> 09:31.196
It is tomorrow morning.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.782
It's five to eight?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.201
Oh, no! I overslept!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.412
I'm gonna be late

09:36.243 --> 09:38.412
for my test!

09:44.834 --> 09:48.255
And now you've heard all

09:44.834 --> 09:48.255
of the instructions and changes.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.756
Oh, it's you!

09:49.797 --> 09:51.216
The one with the mad dog.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.844
<i>You're</i> giving the test?

09:54.886 --> 09:56.513
Life's funny, isn't it?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.226
What are these changes?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.685
If you had been here on time

10:02.727 --> 10:04.438
you would have heard them.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.442
You know, your entire future

10:04.479 --> 10:08.442
rests with this.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.026
It's not just a test.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.070
Tell me about it.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.155
I just did. Now sit down.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.536
Nice slippers, Deej.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.662
Oh, my God!

10:23.415 --> 10:27.001
I can't believe I overslept!

10:23.415 --> 10:27.001
Kimmy, what are the changes?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.670
You may now take out

10:27.043 --> 10:29.670
your number four pencils.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.839
Number<i> four</i> pencils?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.092
I thought we were supposed

10:31.881 --> 10:34.092
to use number two pencils.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.427
Wake up and smell the changes.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.640
To begin, uh, everyone write

10:37.471 --> 10:40.640
your names on the answer sheet.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.435
[smash]

10:55.113 --> 10:57.782
Alright, everybody. We will

10:55.113 --> 10:57.782
begin with the math section.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.535
You may take out

10:57.824 --> 11:00.535
your calculators and begin.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.787
[sighs]

11:05.540 --> 11:07.834
Hey, my calculator's gone!

11:07.875 --> 11:09.169
I must have dropped

11:07.875 --> 11:09.169
it somewhere!

11:10.044 --> 11:11.546
Uh, excuse me!

11:11.588 --> 11:13.298
We are in the middle

11:11.588 --> 11:13.298
of a test.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.133
Uh, this is an emergency.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.261
Uh, D.J., you dropped

11:15.175 --> 11:18.261
your calculator on the stairs.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.929
Oh, great! You brought it?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.431
I stepped on it.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.558
But I brought this.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.733
And the addition key,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.733
it doesn't work.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.571
Leave this classroom,

11:34.110 --> 11:36.571
immediately.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.616
Oh, I've got something

11:36.613 --> 11:39.616
for you, too. Look.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.951
Potato for the teacher.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.997

Okay, okay.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.249
'Okay, okay.'

11:48.291 --> 11:50.251
Joe Pesci is..

11:50.293 --> 11:51.710
...somewhat taller.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.381
Now get out.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.842
Boy, what got into you? Somebody

11:54.422 --> 11:57.842

12:23.076 --> 12:25.453

12:25.495 --> 12:27.163
without eating breakfast, so I

12:27.205 --> 12:28.456
I brought her this,

12:27.205 --> 12:28.456
uh, breakfast burrito.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.832
No. We can't have food here.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.832
You have to--

12:29.874 --> 12:30.958
You don't understand,

12:29.874 --> 12:30.958
I gotta give her

12:31.000 --> 12:32.043
this breakfast burrito, lady.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.503
I mean, this is my<i> niece.</i>

12:33.545 --> 12:35.171
You know, I was there

12:33.545 --> 12:35.171
the day she was born.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.465
And believe me, she was

12:35.213 --> 12:37.465
a beautiful, beautiful baby.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.800
I mean, I remember rocking

12:37.507 --> 12:39.800
her in my arms

12:39.842 --> 12:41.928
and she's looking up at me

12:39.842 --> 12:41.928
with those big beautiful eyes.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.971
And so I beg of you

So, D.J.,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.088
how is it going?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.841
Well, it's terrible.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.841
It's a disaster!

Do you get paid

16:50.802 --> 16:53.847
You know, when they buy a vowel,

I, uh..

21:24.951 --> 21:27.078
I guess, I just

21:24.951 --> 21:27.078
didn't mean it.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.371
Well, then why did you say it?

Because I didn't want

21:29.413 --> 21:31.498
you to be nervous.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.293
But that was making me

21:31.540 --> 21:34.293
more nervous.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.796
Okay, so I guess

21:34.334 --> 21:36.796
it didn't work, then.

21:38.256 --> 21:39.548
No, not really.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.440
my pencil around.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.028
So I guess I just

21:58.818 --> 22:01.028
gotta face it, huh?

everything you could do.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.621
I think what you have to do now

22:08.786 --> 22:10.621
is just, you know

22:10.663 --> 22:13.666
believe in yourself

22:10.663 --> 22:13.666

22:31.517 --> 22:33.644
My name is Mrs. Moffatt.

And I'll be administering

22:33.686 --> 22:35.771
this test.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.732
To begin, write your name

22:35.813 --> 22:38.732
on your answer sheet.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.987
I'm drawing a blank.

22:45.363 --> 22:48.534
Excuse me, are number two

22:45.363 --> 22:48.534
pencils okay?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.828
