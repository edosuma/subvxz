(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:04.072 --> 00:07.241
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:07.275 --> 00:07.808
In New York City,

00:07.841 --> 00:09.410
the dedicated detectives

00:09.443 --> 00:11.279
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.312 --> 00:13.047
are members
of an elite squad

00:13.081 --> 00:14.682
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.285
These are their stories.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.760
[horn blares]

00:28.396 --> 00:29.230
Jesus!
Whoa!

00:35.369 --> 00:37.037
Set up the trauma room!

00:39.107 --> 00:40.408
(Munch)
Boy's name is Sean Hamill,

00:40.441 --> 00:41.809
5th grade at St. Victor's.
What happened?

00:41.842 --> 00:43.777
Single stab wound
to the back.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.347
E.R. noticed bruising
on the chest and buttocks
and called us.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.149
Sounds like somebody used
this kid as a punching bag.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.483
Sexual abuse?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.485
No trauma, but we're still
waiting on the rape kit.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.786
Who brought him in?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.689
Some genius threw him out
of a moving car.
Nobody saw the driver.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.725
Anything off
the surveillance cameras?
Security's on it.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.793
Detectives,
Sean Hamill's out of surgery.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.595
He okay?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.764
He's alive.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.600
(Edgar)
Hey, Sean,
how you feeling?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.369
Dad.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.871
It's okay, Sean.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.607
They're detectives.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.776
They want to ask you
about what happened today.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.412
You remember anything?

01:20.648 --> 01:25.519
Last bell. Putting my books
in the locker.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.855
I think I played stick ball
with Joey Sparacino.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.491
Then I was here.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.560
Mm-hmm. How about
after the stick ball game?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.328
I don't remember.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.597
(Lenore)
A bully's
been picking on him.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.267
Last week, Sean came home
covered in bruises.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.669
Who did that, Sean?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.304
Nobody.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.506
I was climbing a tree,
and I fell.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.876
Someone beat him up.
He was too scared to say who.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.178
Okay.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.780
Sean, you gotta tell us.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.782
Later, okay?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.184
I want to go home.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.851
No, Sean.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.422
No, I'm fine. Promise.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.231
Dad, how come
I can't move my legs?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.405
What's wrong
with my legs?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.177
Ssssh.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.913
It's okay.
It's okay.

02:25.946 --> 02:29.783
It's gonna be okay.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.537
Principal Parker instituted
a zero tolerance policy
on fighting.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.539
One incident
and you're expelled.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.976
So who did you kick out
this weekend for
beating up Sean Hamill?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.813
No one. He said he fell
climbing a tree. He's lucky
he didn't break his neck.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.782
He wasn't so lucky today.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.284
Someone stabbed Sean
in the back.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.519
He won't walk again.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.255
Now, we're going
to need to interview anyone
who saw Sean today.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.890
Teachers, students.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.325
Starting with you,
Father Justin.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.826
I didn't see Sean today.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.595
Really.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.729
Cause the hospital
security tape

03:48.762 --> 03:50.298
shows Sean being dumped
from your car.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.500
That's impossible.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.703
My car has been
in the parking lot all day.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.771
We have a clear match
on the license plate.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.407
But Father Justin's
been in the library

03:59.440 --> 04:00.641
correcting papers
all afternoon.

04:00.674 --> 04:04.945
Okay. So why was his car
at Mercy Hospital?

04:04.978 --> 04:07.448
I leave my keys
on the visor

04:07.481 --> 04:09.317
so parishioners
can borrow it.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.984
We'll need the list.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.020
In the meantime,
we're going to have
to interview the students.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.623
One time this big boy,
he pushed Sean.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.325
He fell down.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.959
What was
the big boy's name?

04:18.992 --> 04:23.997
I don't know, but he's bad.
I saw him smoking.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.366
What about bullying?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.634
I start talking
about people,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.902
they're going to start
talking about me.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.972
You're gonna let
whoever crippled Sean Hamill
hurt someone else?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.742
Just because
I'm a recess monitor
doesn't make me a narc.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.811
Adam, if you know
who beat up Sean Hamill,
you've got to tell us.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.347
Why won't Sean tell you?

04:39.380 --> 04:42.383
He's scared. And I can see
that you are too.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.052
I'm no wuss.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.522
There's this fat kid,
pushes everybody around.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.492
He beat the crap
out of Sean last week.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.826
Can you tell me his name?

04:54.662 --> 04:56.997
Charlie Monaghan.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.532
(Ray)
He didn't hit anybody.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.933
(Benson)
Mr. Monaghan, please.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.436
What'd you do,
Charlie?

05:02.470 --> 05:05.072
He made fun of me.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.574
He said the reason
my girlfriend

05:06.607 --> 05:08.075
won't have sex with me

05:08.108 --> 05:10.778
is cause she's afraid
I'll squash her.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.514
And so
you beat him up.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.916
He made me so mad I grabbed him
in the parking lot,

05:15.949 --> 05:17.551
and I lost it.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.821
Okay.
What happened today?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.856
I haven't seen Sean today.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.825
I've stayed away from him
ever since last week.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.495
Is there anybody who can
tell us where you were

05:27.528 --> 05:29.363
at 4:00 this afternoon?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.598
Yeah. Emma.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.866
I walked her home
after the last bell at 3:00.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.635
And we stopped
at Farrell's Ice Cream

05:34.668 --> 05:36.804
on the way home.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.039
Emma your girlfriend?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.709
She's his half sister.
She's my ex-wife's daughter.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.511
(Stabler)
Where can we find her?

05:43.544 --> 05:45.145
She's been staying
with her grandparents

05:45.178 --> 05:47.548
since her mom got sick.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.486
(Stabler)
How long has Emma
been living here?

05:52.520 --> 05:53.821
Just a couple of days

05:53.854 --> 05:55.956
since Kate had to go back
into the hospital.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.992
Kate has lupus.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.594
Sorry to hear that.

06:02.930 --> 06:06.700
Emma, we wanted to
ask you some questions
about Charlie.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.035
Is he in trouble?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.937
Just trying to find out
where he was today.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.105
We went to Farrell's
to get some ice cream

06:12.139 --> 06:13.407
after last bell.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.108
Then he walked me home.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.711
Emma, why'd you tell us
where Charlie was after school?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.747
Why not during classes
or before?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.415
The high school's
in a different building

06:21.449 --> 06:22.683
than the elementary school.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.519
After last bell
is the only time she'd see him.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.455
(Benson)
Sweetheart,

06:27.488 --> 06:30.524
did Charlie tell you
to say that he was with you
if anybody asked?

06:30.558 --> 06:32.493
Are you saying
my granddaughter

06:32.526 --> 06:34.094
is not telling the truth?

06:34.127 --> 06:37.498
(Benson)
Emma, did Charlie
ask you to lie?

06:37.531 --> 06:40.968
No.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.903
You know how important
it is to tell the truth,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.638
don't you?

06:44.672 --> 06:45.806
Lying's a sin.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.875
A vanilla sin,
not the mortal kind.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.743
But all sins are bad.

06:49.777 --> 06:53.581
So you have to never do them
no matter what.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.751
She's lying to protect
her brother.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.186
Charlie loses his temper,
stabs Sean,

06:59.219 --> 07:02.222
dumps him at the E.R.,
tells his sister to alibi him.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.724
You gonna bring him in?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.459
Uh, we're waiting
for the crime scene report

07:05.493 --> 07:06.927
before we have
another go at him.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.596
Ask and ye shall receive,
unless, of course,

07:08.629 --> 07:09.763
you're Jewish.
I'm not.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.064
Lab lifted over
a dozen prints

07:11.098 --> 07:12.766
from Father Justin's car.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.035
They were all over the place
except for the driver's side.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.204
Pretty smart kid
to be wiping prints.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
(Munch)
He wasn't as careful
with the passenger side.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.609
Found this wedged
under the seat cushion.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.777
What is that?
A strand of rope?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.514
CSU said
it's painter's canvas

07:26.547 --> 07:27.981
like the kids use
at St. Victor's

07:28.015 --> 07:29.850
for their art projects.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.022
(Parker)
We always keep a roll
in stock.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.825
Lasts a lot longer than runny
watercolors on paper.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.827
Perp must've wrapped Sean
in this canvas

07:39.860 --> 07:41.829
to keep his blood off
the car seat.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.864
The parking lot
is only 20 yards from here.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.833
He wraps Sean up,
carries him over there,

07:45.866 --> 07:47.901
and then dumps the canvas
after he returns the car.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.970
We're gonna need to look
through the school dumpsters.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
Of course.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.940
(Munch)
Well, this is interesting.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.276
Do kids have access
to these?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.946
We teach them
to be careful.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.848
Crime scene needs
to go through this room too.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.949
I'll bring in a team.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.817
But I got something
for you first.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.253
I checked out
the security camera
at Marty's deli

08:06.286 --> 08:07.521
across from the school.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.122
What were you doing
at Marty's?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.290
They got Pixy Stix.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.692
But I saw
the security camera,

08:11.725 --> 08:12.960
and I got an idea.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.828
Video tape shows Charlie
without Emma

08:14.862 --> 08:16.964
buying a chocolate bar
at 4:02.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.832
He said

08:18.866 --> 08:21.201
he walked Emma home
at 3:00.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.135
(Benson)
You're going to jail,
Charlie.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.071
And if we charge you
as an adult,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.238
you're looking
at 20 years.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.740
For what?
He didn't do anything.

08:26.774 --> 08:27.908
(Stabler)
Security camera puts you

08:27.941 --> 08:29.209
right outside the school
just 20 minutes

08:29.242 --> 08:30.277
before Sean was dumped

08:30.310 --> 08:32.212
at the hospital.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.280
Clock must be wrong.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.414
I swear I was walking
Emma home.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.585
You really think that a jury's
gonna believe your story?

08:37.618 --> 08:40.654
Especially when Emma's
not even in the video tape?

08:40.688 --> 08:43.757
Charlie, a 12-year-old
will never walk again

08:43.791 --> 08:45.959
because you stabbed him
in the back.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.695
I didn't do it.
I already told you.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.196
I was walking Emma home.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.298
[knock at door]

08:51.331 --> 08:53.133
We got something.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.241
Found these scissors
in the school dumpster.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.911
She means I found them
underneath the tuna casserole.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.646
All she did was
stand there and point.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.914
There's traces of blood

09:06.947 --> 09:08.882
on the blades.
Any prints?

09:08.916 --> 09:11.619
Two. Neither
of them Charlie's.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.954
How do you know that?
We haven't printed them yet.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.789
We don't need to.
The prints are too small.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.858
The size
a seven or eight year old
would leave.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.293
Except an eight-year-old
doesn't know to clean up
the prints

09:20.327 --> 09:22.596
or how to drive a car.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.935
Emma stabbed him?

09:27.968 --> 09:30.337
And then Charlie
cleaned up the mess.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.005
Emma's not lying
to protect her brother.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.941
He's lying
to protect her.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.817
(Principal Parker)
Emma isn't in school today.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.819
She's at the hospital
with her mother,

09:45.853 --> 09:47.821
which, honestly,
is just as well.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.323
It's just as well one of your
students is missing school?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.126
I didn't mean it that way.
Emma's situation
is complicated.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.962
We have time.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.700
When Emma's mother
enrolled her
at St. Victor's,

09:59.733 --> 10:03.003
she told us that
she was a single parent.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.139
She hid the fact
that Emma has another parent,

10:06.173 --> 10:07.708
a woman.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.110
Emma's mom's gay.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.913
So what's the big deal?
Same-sex couples
raise kids all the time.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.215
Yes, but they
don't usually lie

10:15.248 --> 10:16.917
about being gay
and enroll their children

10:16.950 --> 10:18.752
in conservative,
Catholic schools.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.953
How'd you find out
she was lying?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.188
When Kate got sick,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.924
her partner began coming
to school functions.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.159
The Parents Council
was furious.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.261
They didn't want their children
in the same classroom

10:28.295 --> 10:29.663
with the daughter
of a lesbian.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.732
They wanted us
to expel Emma.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.801
So you didn't take them
seriously.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.935
Well, we had to.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.770
Parents were keeping kids
out of school,

10:36.804 --> 10:38.371
donors withdrew
their support--

10:38.405 --> 10:39.773
What were we
supposed to do?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.208
How about ignoring them?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.076
That's easy for you to say,

10:43.110 --> 10:46.947
but how do you teach catechism
with Emma in the classroom?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.849
"Homosexuality
is a sin, kids.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.017
"But, oh, that's okay, Emma,

10:50.050 --> 10:53.286
your moms are good people
otherwise."

10:53.320 --> 10:55.723
So why didn't you
expel her?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.457
Because her parents
sued the school.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.127
So Emma returns to St. Victor's
with a target on her back.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.762
Yes, which is why I say

11:01.795 --> 11:04.932
the less Emma is here,
the better it is for everyone.

11:12.873 --> 11:13.907
(Zoe)
Excuse me.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.142
You can't go in there.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.744
(Stabler)
Police.

11:16.777 --> 11:17.878
We need to speak
with Emma Boyd.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
I'm Zoe, Emma's mom.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.249
She had nothing to do
with what happened
to Sean Hamill.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.451
Oh, how'd you hear
about Sean?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.887
Kate's ex-husband
called.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.189
He said you think
Charlie and Emma

11:29.222 --> 11:30.123
are involved.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.193
Charlie and Emma
are covering for each other.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.029
And we need Emma to tell us
exactly what happened yesterday.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.366
Well, her mom is dying.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.801
Can this wait?

11:40.834 --> 11:44.404
It'll just take a moment.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.373
I didn't do anything.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.743
Emma, even if it was
an accident,

11:49.777 --> 11:52.045
you need to tell us.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.082
We know that school's
been tough lately,
and kids can be really cruel.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.784
(Stabler)
Is that what happened
with you and Sean?

11:56.817 --> 11:59.019
Did he say something mean?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.021
He said I was a freak,
and I was gonna go to hell.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.089
Why?

12:02.122 --> 12:05.358
Because I have two moms
instead of a mom and a dad.

12:05.392 --> 12:09.863
Sweetie,
we talked about this,
didn't we?

12:09.897 --> 12:10.697
What did we say?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.133
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

12:13.166 --> 12:14.434
but words may never hurt me.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.938
Emma, Charlie lied to us.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.374
We know
that he drove Sean
to the hospital.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.477
Now, if you don't tell
us the truth, he's gonna
get in a lot of trouble.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.279
I am telling you
the truth!

12:26.313 --> 12:28.782
Detective,
Emma didn't hurt Sean.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.019
Just like she's never hurt
any of the other kids

12:32.052 --> 12:33.520
who are mean to her
at school.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.555
(Stabler)
If the kids at St. Victor's
are so mean,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.324
then why not send her
somewhere else?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.893
Our faith is important to us.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.528
We want Emma to have
a Catholic education,

12:41.561 --> 12:44.898
and St. Victor's is the best
Catholic school in the city.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.801
Seems to me she can't be
getting much of an education
if the kids keep bothering her.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.536
(Zoe)
She can deal with them.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.772
She goes to therapy.
If she has any problems,
she talks to me.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.810
Where were you yesterday
at 4:00 p.m.?

12:56.844 --> 13:00.313
You think I drove Sean
to the emergency room?

13:00.347 --> 13:01.581
Did you?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.483
I was here,
with Kate.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.018
(Cragen)
Now, how hard

13:05.052 --> 13:06.987
can it be to get the truth
out of an eight-year-old?

13:07.020 --> 13:09.923
You try breaking a kid
whose mother is dying
in the next room.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.491
Emma's been
through a lot, Captain.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.561
In the six months
since Zoe and Kate
took St. Victor's to court,

13:14.594 --> 13:15.929
whole family's
been harassed--

13:15.963 --> 13:17.164
They even changed
their phone number, twice.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.265
(Fin)
It didn't do any good.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.266
Broken windows,

13:19.299 --> 13:20.868
graffiti on their doors.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.171
Zoe's filed six reports.
Nobody's ever been charged.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.873
Since when did New York
become a red state?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.474
(Benson)
It's not just happening here.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.011
A Catholic school in California
tried to expel two brothers

13:31.044 --> 13:32.279
because they were being
raised by a gay couple.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
Emma would've been
much better off

13:34.347 --> 13:36.984
if Zoe had just gone along
with Kate's lie to the school.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.186
You think Zoe
should stay in the closet

13:39.219 --> 13:41.088
just to make a bunch
of homophobes happy?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.956
You don't send your kid
to military school
if you're a pacifist.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.324
Not without expecting
some friction.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.093
So you agree
with the school.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.394
I'm just saying
it's complicated.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.597
Being Catholic means
believing in certain things.
Zoe knows that.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.299
But she wanted
to make a point.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.002
Take the school to court.
Win one for the cause.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.036
Somebody's gotta
fight the fight.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.237
But it shouldn't be
an eight-year-old.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.874
Emma's so messed up,
she has to see a shrink
twice a week.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.375
(Cragen)
Looks like Zoe could use

14:02.409 --> 14:04.011
some counseling too.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.346
Her LUDs show multiple calls
to one number.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.281
Father Justin.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.118
Maybe she did need
to borrow his car.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.989
(Father Justin)
I don't think Zoe's
ever called me.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.025
Why does your number keep coming
up on her phone records?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.526
Because I gave it
to Emma.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.494
When she first started
having trouble at school,

14:21.528 --> 14:23.563
I told her to call anytime
she needed someone to talk to.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.900
Did she ever mention
having trouble
with Sean Hamill?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.002
All the time.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.204
Sean really did
pick on Emma.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.907
Every chance he got.

14:33.941 --> 14:37.410
I talked to him.
I pleaded with him.
Nothing worked.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.679
You ever
call his parents?
I tried.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.249
I got censured for it.
Again.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.251
Still, you knew
Sean was tormenting Emma,

14:44.284 --> 14:46.186
and you kept quiet
to save your own neck.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.522
I like being a priest.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.525
And I am this close to having
the church remove my faculties.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.561
I didn't want the school
to get any bad press.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.431
Spin control's more important
than keeping two kids
from ruining their lives.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.101
I knew I should've
done something.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.604
I guess I was just hoping
Charlie's beating

15:04.637 --> 15:06.106
would make Sean
leave Emma alone.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.707
(Benson)
Did it?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.676
For a week.

15:09.709 --> 15:13.613
But he was just planning
the next horrible thing
to do to her.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.183
After you questioned me,
I went back to the school.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.318
I found this
in the art room.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.523
It's Emma's ponytail.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.093
Sean cut it off.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.228
Then Emma used
the scissors on him.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.367
(Stabler) You remember
seeing Emma Boyd at school
that afternoon?

15:34.401 --> 15:35.735
Yeah.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.338
I think she was there.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.339
Talk to her?

15:39.372 --> 15:42.009
No.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.643
You don't like her,
do you?

15:46.713 --> 15:49.182
You ever pick on her?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.518
Well, I only bother Emma
'cause she's so weird.

15:51.551 --> 15:52.719
She is, huh?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.054
Why is she weird?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.155
Her mom's a lesbian.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.156
Mm-hmm.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.058
It's just wrong.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.228
The Bible says homosexuality
is a sin.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.496
I don't remember
seeing that in the Bible.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.433
Corinthians says gay people
are going to hell.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.068
That's in the New Testament.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.137
The Old Testament
is way harsher.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.372
It says gays
should be put to death.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.374
All right, and...

16:14.407 --> 16:17.444
so that makes it okay
for you to cut off
Emma's hair.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.750
Why'd you do it, Sean?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.618
I didn't hurt her.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.686
It was just a joke!

16:26.719 --> 16:29.422
You went after a little girl
with a pair of scissors.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.191
All I did was cut her hair.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.494
She stabbed me in the back.
And now I can't walk.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.129
It's not fair.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.100
[knock at door]

16:40.133 --> 16:43.002
Elliot, Sean's parents
are here.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.678
Why were you talking
to Sean again?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.613
Don't you need
a parent's permission
to talk to a child?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.815
Sean is
not a suspect.
He's the victim.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.717
Did he remember anything?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.520
Yeah-- that he bullied
a girl at school.

17:00.553 --> 17:05.158
Emma Boyd should have never been
accepted at St. Victor's.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.160
Why, because
her moms are gay?

17:07.194 --> 17:10.463
Look, we pay a lot of money
to give Sean
a private education.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.765
We should have a say in
deciding what he's exposed to.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.735
So you told your son
it was okay to pick on
an eight-year-old girl.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.671
We told him
that he should feel sorry
for people like Emma's moms

17:18.705 --> 17:21.174
and that he
should pray for them.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.243
Well, that's not
the message he got.

17:23.276 --> 17:28.815
Did that girl stab Sean?

17:28.848 --> 17:30.483
Yeah.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.352
Then I don't care

17:32.385 --> 17:35.288
if he called her a fag dyke
whore bitch from hell.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.524
Arrest her.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.231
(Benson)
We know what happened, Emma.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.565
Sean told us.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.434
(Zoe)
And you believe
that little monster?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.436
(Stabler)
The evidence backs up
his story.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.139
Right down to why
Emma's hair's so short.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.641
She got gum
stuck in it.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.644
Charlie tried to help.
He made a mess of it.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.246
(Stabler)
Hey, Emma.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.314
That's not what happened,
is it?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.187
We know what Sean
really did to you.

18:09.489 --> 18:13.126
(Zoe)
What did he do?

18:13.160 --> 18:17.897
Emma, what happened?

18:17.930 --> 18:21.100
You been lying to Mommy Zoe?

18:29.776 --> 18:33.880
Yes, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt Sean.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.816
It's just,
he kept yelling, saying,
"You're a dike! You're a dike!"

18:36.849 --> 18:40.487
And I told him I'm not.
And he said, "Prove it."

18:40.520 --> 18:43.156
And then he went to kiss me,
so I pushed him away.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.226
And then he grabbed me
and cut off my hair.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.260
And said,
"Yes, you're a dike.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.697
And now you look like one."

18:50.730 --> 18:54.334
I was so mad.
I was so ugly.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.468
I grabbed the scissors,

18:55.502 --> 18:58.338
and I hurt him
in the back with them.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.374
He fell down
and hit his head.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.679
And that's when
you got Charlie?

19:06.713 --> 19:10.450
He took Sean
to the hospital
in Father Justin's car.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.287
He told me
to throw the scissors out.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.289
I'm sorry.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.358
I didn't mean to tell
all those lies.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.792
Sweetie, it's okay.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.628
It's gonna be okay.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.399
She didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.839
We still have to arrest her.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.708
Well, it's late.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.245
Can't it wait until she visits
Kate in the hospital?

19:42.549 --> 19:46.219
Get an attorney
and bring her in by 9:00 AM.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.895
(Benson)
Sean must have
really scared Emma.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.497
She's a good kid.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.965
She's never been in
any trouble until now.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.334
Who's prosecuting her case
in family court?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.935
New guy,
Garrett Gillespie.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.605
I've never met him,
but he's supposed to be
a hard-ass.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.674
Zoe?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.508
We weren't expecting you
until the morning.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.543
Well, I figured
we'd beat the commute.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.579
Motion to suppress
Emma's confession.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.880
On what grounds?

20:13.913 --> 20:16.383
Your detectives
interrogated a minor
without the parent present.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.386
Emma's mom is a patient
at Clinton Hospital.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.921
We questioned her in the
presence of her other mom
Zoe Dunlop.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.757
Kate Boyd is Emma's
biological mother.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.594
And despite Zoe and Kate's
10 year partnership,

20:27.627 --> 20:29.996
the law doesn't recognize Zoe
as Kate's wife

20:30.029 --> 20:31.931
or as Emma's mom.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.333
She never adopted her.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.834
Fine, she's not Emma's mother.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.869
She's still her legal guardian
while Kate's in the hospital.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.838
De facto guardian, yes.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.873
But the state doesn't
afford her the right
to make decisions for Emma.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.310
She's no more her parent
or guardian

20:43.343 --> 20:44.511
that a babysitter would be.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.779
You raised Emma
ever since she was born.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.649
How can you say that
you're nothing more
than a babysitter?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.985
I should have
legal rights over Emma,
but I don't.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.555
So why should I claim them now
when it can only hurt her?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.957
(Kressler)
The confession's out.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.993
You wanna talk to Emma again,
go through me.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.071
Casey Novak?
Garrett Gillespie.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.973
I'm handling
Emma Boyd's case
in family court.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.442
It's nice to meet you.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.510
I got a call
from Sean Hamill's parents.

21:17.544 --> 21:20.380
They wanna know
why Emma Boyd hasn't
been arrested yet.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.649
The mom's lawyer
got the confession suppressed.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.452
I don't need the confession
to convict that girl.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.789
There's no question
she did it,

21:29.822 --> 21:32.359
but do you really want to
send her to jail for 10 years?

21:32.392 --> 21:35.995
She jammed a pair of scissors
so far into Sean's back
she severed his spinal cord.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.064
Well, Sean tormented Emma.
He drove her to the edge.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.466
She belongs in counseling,
not juvie.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.833
You're entitled
to your opinion,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.602
but this is my case.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.836
Tell SVU
to arrest Emma Boyd.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.082
Detectives,
what are you doing here?

21:56.115 --> 21:57.950
Where's Emma?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.953
She went to the nursing station
to get some juice. Why?

22:03.022 --> 22:05.725
Ms. Boyd,
I'm Detective Stabler.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.927
I'm sorry.
I'm here to arrest Emma
for assaulting Sean Hamill.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.496
You can't take her.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.431
She didn't do anything.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.400
She told me she didn't.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.035
She told us something
different, didn't she, Zoe?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.938
Please don't do this.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.907
We have no choice.
You promised to bring her in.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.875
What did you do, Zoe?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.412
Deb, stay out of this.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.680
She's my granddaughter.
I wanna know what's happening.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.483
Mom, please.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.919
Mom, Olivia says
I have to go with her.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.554
(Benson)
Someone should
come with us.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.556
I'll go.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.690
No, I'll go.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.592
Both of you...go.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.729
I'll stay with mom.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.406
How'd it go?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.907
Great.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.143
I love putting eight-year-olds
in lockup overnight.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.446
Family court judge
will probably
let her out tomorrow.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.881
She can stay at home
until the trial.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.983
Home with her grandparents,
I hope.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.719
James Decker. I represent
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.188
My client would like
to see her granddaughter.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.757
I'm sorry,
but that's not possible.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.559
She's at detention until
her court appearance tomorrow.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.694
You're putting my
granddaughter in jail?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.863
She stabbed Sean Hamill
in the back.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.798
(Decker)
None of this
would've happened

23:18.831 --> 23:20.867
if Zoe hadn't forced
her lifestyle on Emma and Kate.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.135
Lifestyle?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.971
Your daughter didn't choose
her sexual orientation.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.940
My daughter was happy
being a wife and a mother

23:27.974 --> 23:29.709
until Zoe came along.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.444
So it's Zoe's fault
that your daughter's gay?

23:31.478 --> 23:33.212
(Decker)
It certainly isn't Emma's.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.015
That child needs someone
to look out for her interests.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.217
Which is why the court
has appointed
an attorney for her.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.820
We'll see about that.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.592
(Gillespie)
The state requests
Emma Boyd

23:45.625 --> 23:47.760
be remanded to
a juvenile facility
pending trial.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.697
She's clearly
a violent child.

23:50.730 --> 23:53.099
Your honor, Emma has no
history of violence

23:53.132 --> 23:55.668
and poses no danger
to anyone.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.538
She should be paroled
to her parents.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.572
I agree.
However, I will require

23:59.606 --> 24:00.807
that she wear
an ankle monitor

24:00.840 --> 24:02.475
and remain confined
to her mother's house.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.777
That's a problem,
your honor.

24:04.811 --> 24:05.978
Emma's mother
is in the hospital.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.015
She has no father
and no legal guardian.

24:09.048 --> 24:12.485
Your honor,
my name is Zoe Dunlop.

24:12.519 --> 24:15.988
Although I am not
Emma's legal guardian,

24:16.022 --> 24:17.790
I'm as much her parent
as her mother is.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.127
Why haven't you
adopted Emma, Ms. Dunlop?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.530
I don't need a piece of paper
to define my relationship
with my daughter.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.265
Unfortunately,
in this court, you do.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.201
Your Honor, maybe I can
offer a solution.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.104
James Decker, representing
Emma's grandparents.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.540
They often care for Emma

24:33.573 --> 24:35.241
while their daughter's
in the hospital.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.977
They'd be happy to do so again
until this matter is resolved.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.246
Emma belongs
at home with me.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.715
Your Honor,
there is precedent here.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.919
Courts frequently grant custody
to what's been defined
as a non-relative family member.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.154
Only in California.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.822
And not when
a blood relative

24:49.856 --> 24:51.824
is willing and able
to take the child.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.193
I wanna go home
with Mommy Zoe!

24:54.226 --> 24:56.228
(Judge Bernard)
I'm sorry.
I can't do that, Emma.

24:56.262 --> 25:00.099
Ms. Dunlop, you claimed
no custodial rights over Emma
when she was arrested,

25:00.132 --> 25:01.534
but now you want
to invoke them.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.670
You can't have it
both ways.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.938
The court hereby releases Emma
to the custody of
her grandparents.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.576
We will begin fact-finding
on the assault case on Tuesday.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.279
No!
Mommy Zoe!

25:13.312 --> 25:15.314
Oh, sweetie.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.917
Hey, hey, it's just
for a couple days, okay?

25:17.950 --> 25:21.654
It's just for
a couple of days, okay?

25:21.688 --> 25:23.289
Detective Benson,

25:23.322 --> 25:25.925
I heard Emma's trial
started today.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.695
Yeah, it's, um--

25:28.728 --> 25:30.697
it's not going well.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.032
What's going
to happen to her?

25:33.065 --> 25:35.968
Worst case, if the judge
thinks she's a danger
to other children,

25:36.002 --> 25:38.605
she'll be sent
to a juvenile facility
until she's 18.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.172
Can't I help?

25:40.206 --> 25:43.743
I'll testify for Emma,
tell the judge Sean teased her.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.012
That's hearsay.
You weren't there.
You didn't see it happen.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.280
We need proof that
Sean Hamill provoked her.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.716
What kind of proof?

25:49.749 --> 25:53.285
Notes, e-mails,
anything like that.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.088
Did you check
the instant messenger log
at the school?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.123
Computers don't save IMs.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.291
The ones at St. Victor's do.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.928
Principal Parker installed
special software

26:01.961 --> 26:04.330
to monitor the student's
conversations.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.702
And then I asked why
I couldn't move my legs.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.239
The doctor said the scissors
cut my spinal cord,

26:13.272 --> 26:15.608
which is why I can't walk.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.246
Your Honor, a moment
of the court's time?

26:20.279 --> 26:23.382
(Judge)
Make it quick.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.686
Here's your proof
that Sean's a bully.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.891
"I wanna teach you
a game after school.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.927
It might hurt,
but it'll cure you
from being a queer."

26:34.961 --> 26:37.930
Does that sound like
a sweet kid?

26:37.964 --> 26:40.066
And that's not
the worst of them.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.234
You know I have to share
this with the defense.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.770
The minute that I do,

26:43.803 --> 26:45.304
Sean's credibility goes
right out the window.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.973
And so does yours.

26:52.879 --> 26:56.816
Your Honor, the people
request a half hour recess.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.418
(Benson)
It took Gillespie about ten
minutes to agree on a deal.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.421
Counseling, anger management,
court evaluation wants a month,

27:02.454 --> 27:05.191
and Emma's back
home with Zoe.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.760
Detectives, sorry
to catch you so late.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.362
You need to remove Emma
from Zoe Dunlop's custody.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.332
Mr. Decker, custody matters
belong in family court.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.868
Unless there's been a crime,
it's out of our hands.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.905
Zoe Dunlop has been
sexually abusing Emma

27:18.938 --> 27:21.373
ever since Kate got sick.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.076
We're gonna have to
hear that from Emma.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.211
You will.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.212
She's at the hospital

27:26.245 --> 27:27.446
with her mother right now.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.749
You can't let her
go home with Zoe.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.951
We've never heard any
allegations before.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.855
It's a pretty big coincidence
that this comes out
just after Zoe gets custody.

27:35.888 --> 27:39.792
Emma showed this
to her grandparents.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.994
Why does a grown woman
take pictures of herself in bed

27:42.028 --> 27:43.830
with a naked
eight-year-old girl?

27:43.863 --> 27:46.265
You search Zoe's apartment,

27:46.298 --> 27:48.167
you'll find dozens more
like it.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.306
(female officer)
Nothing unusual
on the computer.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.009
Mostly emails and a bunch
of crappy mp3 downloads.

27:57.043 --> 28:01.180
Tuition bill,
tuition bill, hospital bill.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.949
Nothing here but people
asking for money.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.017
Looks like they had enough cash
to have a little fun.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.954
Coney Island,
Statue of Liberty.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.890
the Met.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.925
Elliot, check this out.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.328
Nude sunbathing.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.931
Emma in the tub
with Zoe.

28:18.965 --> 28:22.935
What's going on?

28:22.969 --> 28:26.238
[sobs]

28:26.272 --> 28:28.107
We've had a complaint.
We need to ask you
some questions.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.410
This is a really bad time.
I'm sorry. It can't wait.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.046
Emma, you okay?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.415
[sobs]

28:36.448 --> 28:39.385
Honey, what's wrong?

28:41.954 --> 28:46.158
Mommy's gone to be
with Jesus.

28:49.862 --> 28:53.866
[sniffles]

29:03.943 --> 29:05.311
Where's Emma?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.113
Her grandparents took
her home with them,

29:07.146 --> 29:09.148
but, um...

29:11.984 --> 29:14.821
you and I gotta
talk about these.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.257
[scoffs]
What do you think
they are, porn?

29:18.290 --> 29:21.928
You got an eight-year-old
lying naked in the bed.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.495
Emma has always been shy.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.165
Kate and I wanted her to have
a positive body image,

29:26.198 --> 29:28.835
so I took these to show her
how beautiful she is.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.236
Well, giving her self-esteem
is one thing,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.038
but you got her vamped
for the camera

29:32.071 --> 29:34.140
like she's a Playboy model.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.474
If you think these are sexy,

29:35.507 --> 29:36.909
you're the one
with the problem.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.811
She looks like an angel.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.183
You're giving her
a positive body image
with this photo too?

29:44.216 --> 29:46.953
You and Emma
lying naked in bed,

29:46.986 --> 29:49.488
touching her thighs.

29:49.521 --> 29:54.927
Emma's therapist recommended
massage to relieve her stress,

29:54.961 --> 29:57.363
so Kate took these on the last
day of my massage classes.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.466
You think because I'm gay,
I am molesting my own daughter?

30:00.499 --> 30:03.169
If I were straight,
would this even be an issue?

30:03.202 --> 30:06.939
This is not about who you are.
It's about what that girl
said you did to her.

30:06.973 --> 30:11.310
Emma would never say
I molested her.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.384
[gasps]

30:21.487 --> 30:24.891
Mommy's always made me
take my clothes off
and get in bed.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.193
Then she touched me.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.495
Where does she touch you?

30:32.098 --> 30:34.033
Go ahead, Emma.
Tell them.

30:43.976 --> 30:47.213
Mrs. Boyd, would you mind
giving us a minute alone
with Emma?

30:56.388 --> 31:00.059
Where did your mommy
touch you?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.529
Everywhere.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.364
Down there.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.000
Did you tell anyone?

31:08.034 --> 31:10.202
She said no one
would understand.

31:10.236 --> 31:13.605
I didn't want her
to touch me, but she said
it would make me feel good.

31:13.639 --> 31:16.475
How did it make you feel?

31:16.508 --> 31:18.477
It made me feel bad.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.047
Bad how?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.415
Like when you tell a lie.

31:23.449 --> 31:27.119
Or when you eat a burger
on Good Friday.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.921
You felt guilty?

31:28.955 --> 31:31.190
Like you were
doing something that
you shouldn't be doing?

31:31.223 --> 31:34.060
I knew it was a sin.

31:34.093 --> 31:37.129
Why was it a sin?

31:37.163 --> 31:40.199
Because girls are not supposed
to naked touch other girls.
It's wrong.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.935
Emma, do you think
that it's wrong

31:42.969 --> 31:45.171
that your mommies sleep
in the same bed together?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.375
God says it's against nature.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.710
Women are supposed
to be with men.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.279
Otherwise they go to hell.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.952
Is that what you
learned in school?

31:59.986 --> 32:02.221
My Grandmom told me.

32:02.254 --> 32:06.358
She said Mommy Zoe
was gonna go to hell
for what she did.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.663
I doubt Zoe molested Emma.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.365
Why?
Emma told me she did.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.334
Emma's description
of the abuse
was intellectual,

32:15.367 --> 32:17.169
not emotional.

32:17.203 --> 32:18.437
Kids say that
molestation hurts.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.406
Emma called it a sin.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.174
What do you think
about those pictures?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.476
Well, a lot of doctors
recommend massage
for children under stress.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.479
I would prescribe it for Emma,
if she were my patient.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.048
How do you explain
Emma's allegations?

32:29.081 --> 32:31.350
Parental
Alienation Syndrome.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.452
I thought P.A.S. was
when a couple splits up

32:33.485 --> 32:36.488
and the mom brainwashes
the kids into thinking
that dad's a bastard.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.689
Well, the same thing's
happening here,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.159
except that
it's the grandmother
turning Emma against Zoe.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.194
But why would Emma
go along with it?

32:42.228 --> 32:45.364
Her grandmother's
manipulated her into
believing that it's true.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.433
So she used the massages
to convince Emma

32:47.466 --> 32:49.401
that her mother had done
something awful.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.172
It's emotional abuse inflicted
by her loving grandmother.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.306
At the very least,

32:54.340 --> 32:55.541
it's custodial interference.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.243
At most,
reckless endangerment.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.778
Either way, the grandparents
still only get
a slap on the wrist.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.480
Unless we can prove
unlawful imprisonment.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.715
How?

33:03.749 --> 33:06.352
Well, they kept a little girl
away from her rightful home

33:06.385 --> 33:08.087
by making her lie
about being abused.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.089
And the reason
that they did that
is because Zoe's gay.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.458
Which would make it
a hate crime.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.592
It's a D felony.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.327
They could get seven years.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.465
Arrest them.

33:22.268 --> 33:25.637
Oliver and Deborah Boyd,
you're under arrest
for unlawful imprisonment.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.273
What are you
talking about?

33:27.306 --> 33:29.275
You filled Emma's head
with lies

33:29.308 --> 33:30.309
to keep her away
from her mother.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.478
Her mother is dead.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.580
Zoe is ruining
my granddaughter's life.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.748
It's our moral duty
to protect her.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.450
Well, try following
the Eighth Commandment.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.352
Thou shall not bear
false witness.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.491
(Zoe)
Emma's grandparents
tricked her

33:45.524 --> 33:49.395
into saying
she'd been molested.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.097
She understands
it's not her fault.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.700
And she understands
I didn't hurt her
in any way.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.604
She's just sad
all the time now.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.540
Her biological mother
just died.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.442
It's understandable
that she'd be upset.

34:03.475 --> 34:07.379
It's not the only reason.
She's scared.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.680
The other night
she woke up crying.

34:08.714 --> 34:13.252
She dreamed
her mom had died,

34:13.285 --> 34:16.755
and the police had come
to take me to jail.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.490
And she kept
calling out for me.

34:18.524 --> 34:19.858
But I couldn't hear her.

34:19.891 --> 34:24.330
No one could hear her.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.265
Thank you.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.805
How long has Emma
been in therapy?
About six months.

34:33.839 --> 34:38.210
Since the kids at school
started making fun of her
for having two moms.

34:38.244 --> 34:41.847
Emma's been attending
St. Victor's for three years.
Why suddenly a problem?

34:41.880 --> 34:45.484
No one knew about her home
situation until recently.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.786
When you insisted on making
your presence known at school.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.688
(Zoe)
Kate was sick.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.457
Emma needed a parent
for school functions.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.225
And you needed
to make a point...

34:53.259 --> 34:55.461
that you were gay

34:55.494 --> 34:57.596
and the school
better not discriminate you.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.731
(Zoe)
I didn't think the school
would react the way they did.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.867
But when they got angry
at your lie,

35:01.900 --> 35:04.436
you chose to
take them to court.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.438
It was important
to take a stand.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.207
More important
than Emma's happiness.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.176
No, of course not.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.911
He was so miserable
at St. Victor's.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.614
Why not enroll her
in another school?

35:15.647 --> 35:20.219
I didn't want her to be ashamed
that her mothers are lesbians.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.421
You think it's appropriate
for an eight-year-old
to fight your battles?

35:22.454 --> 35:26.158
I have never done that.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.360
If you love her so much,

35:28.394 --> 35:32.464
who did you make her stay
at St. Victor's
even though she hated it?

35:32.498 --> 35:35.167
If I had it to do again,
I would have taken her out
of that place.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.602
But you didn't.

35:36.635 --> 35:40.172
And because of you Sean Hamill
will never walk again.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.740
Objection.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.442
I know.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.313
I'd change it if I could.

35:47.346 --> 35:51.550
I made a mistake,
and I'm sorry.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.921
Nothing further.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.333
Even after
her mom got sick,

36:07.366 --> 36:09.868
Emma was always
a happy girl.

36:09.901 --> 36:13.905
And then suddenly
about eight months ago...

36:13.939 --> 36:14.973
she wasn't.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.209
What changed?

36:17.243 --> 36:18.710
She was scared...

36:18.744 --> 36:19.878
and lonely.

36:19.911 --> 36:20.912
Zoe was either at work

36:20.946 --> 36:23.615
or at the hospital.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.984
Emma's brother had to walk
her home from school everyday.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.487
What did you do?

36:28.520 --> 36:32.358
My husband and I
asked our daughter if Emma
could stay with us after school.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.826
Zoe didn't like it.

36:34.860 --> 36:39.765
That's when she made Kate
write her will.

36:39.798 --> 36:43.402
She made Kate
write her will?

36:43.435 --> 36:45.371
Kate was getting sicker
and sicker,

36:45.404 --> 36:46.838
and sometimes she didn't
even recognize us.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.642
Zoe wanted to make sure
she got sole custody of Emma.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.379
Mrs. Boyd,
did you persuade Emma

36:53.412 --> 36:54.613
to make false allegations
against Zoe?

36:54.646 --> 36:57.449
No.

36:57.483 --> 37:01.587
I saw Emma was unhappy,
and I asked her what was wrong.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.988
That's all.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.590
Thank you.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.628
Mrs. Boyd,

37:09.661 --> 37:11.963
can you read the signature
at the bottom
of your daughter's will,

37:11.997 --> 37:13.965
right next to where
it says "witness"?

37:13.999 --> 37:16.402
Ray Monaghan.

37:16.435 --> 37:20.906
So Kate's ex-husband
thought she was lucid enough
to co-sign her will.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.541
Kate wasn't thinking clearly.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.876
She-- She didn't
want to hurt Zoe.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.279
She wasn't thinking
of the best home for Emma.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.515
By the best home, do you mean
the best heterosexual home?

37:29.548 --> 37:31.550
Objection.
Argumentative.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.552
I'll rephrase.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.021
Do you think gay people
should be allowed
to raise children?

37:37.723 --> 37:39.491
Ideally, no.

37:39.525 --> 37:43.028
I think children should be
raised by their father
and their mother.

37:43.061 --> 37:46.532
This is why you made up
allegations
against Zoe Dunlop,

37:46.565 --> 37:48.934
because your faith
rejected the idea

37:48.967 --> 37:50.702
of a gay woman raising
your granddaughter.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.904
It isn't just about faith.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.341
I have read enough to know
what would happen to Emma
if Zoe raises her.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.742
(Novak)
What would happen?

37:56.775 --> 38:00.612
(Deb)
She will grow up

38:00.646 --> 38:02.414
sexually confused,
promiscuous.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.850
She will experiment
with homosexual relationships.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.752
And what makes you
think that?

38:06.785 --> 38:09.087
I have read studies.

38:09.120 --> 38:14.860
Like the one that says
that kids raised by gay couples

38:14.893 --> 38:17.829
are 48 times more likely
to be molested by their parents

38:17.863 --> 38:20.632
than kids raised
by straight parents.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.834
Where did you come across
these studies?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.736
My attorney showed them
to me.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.478
When did he
show them to you?

38:32.511 --> 38:34.546
Objection.
Relevance?

38:34.580 --> 38:37.315
Please answer the question,
Mrs. Boyd.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.654
During Emma's trial
in family court.

38:42.688 --> 38:46.091
So, just before
you accused Zoe Dunlop
of molesting Emma.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.793
Yes.

38:47.826 --> 38:51.430
What I read made me
start looking for clues.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.664
Then when we found the photos,

38:52.698 --> 38:55.100
we knew we had to ask Emma
what was going on.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.136
And did Mr. Decker tell you
what kind of questions
to ask Emma?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.906
Your Honor,
this line of questioning

39:00.939 --> 39:03.442
is a direct violation
of attorney-client privilege.

39:03.475 --> 39:06.678
Privilege protects the client,
not the attorney, Your Honor.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.981
I'll allow it.
Go ahead, Mrs. Boyd.

39:11.917 --> 39:16.855
Mr. Decker said to be
forceful with Emma.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.691
He said molested children
often deny being abused.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.628
Sometimes they have
to be led to the truth.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.130
Your Honor, Mr. Decker
clearly coached his clients

39:25.163 --> 39:28.434
into manipulating
an abuse allegation out of Emma.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.735
That's not just outrageous.
It's criminal.

39:29.768 --> 39:34.840
I offered advice on how
to talk to an abused child.
That's all.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.610
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd never
would have accused Zoe Dunlop
had it not been for Mr. Decker.

39:38.644 --> 39:41.079
That's enough.
Counsel approach.

39:43.048 --> 39:47.018
Your Honor, Miss Novak
has absolutely no basis
for these allegations.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.955
And Mr. Decker has
a history of representing
straight clients

39:49.988 --> 39:51.957
fighting custody battles
with their gay exes.

39:51.990 --> 39:55.594
So I get slandered
for choosing
who I want to represent?

39:55.627 --> 39:58.196
You fed your clients
anti-gay material before
custody was even an issue

39:58.229 --> 40:00.666
because you were gearing up
for a fight.

40:00.699 --> 40:04.470
That means you conspired
to keep Emma away from Zoe.
You committed a hate crime.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.473
That's ridiculous.
Not to mention you
can't prove any of it.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.140
Mr. Decker,

40:09.174 --> 40:12.077
at the very least this
is a serious breach
of ethical conduct.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.045
Your Honor--

40:14.079 --> 40:16.748
I have no choice
but to remove you as counsel
and declare a mistrial.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.457
I'm willing to offer you
a plea arrangement

40:25.491 --> 40:28.126
in exchange for your testimony
against Mr. Decker.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.861
Why would we testify
against him?

40:29.895 --> 40:33.799
Because he manipulated you
by using faulty research.

40:33.832 --> 40:37.135
According to the American
Sociological Association,

40:37.168 --> 40:39.471
gay parents are not...

40:39.505 --> 40:42.608
48 times more likely
to molest their kids.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.846
The article I read
says differently.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.849
That article was written
by a man who was expelled

40:50.882 --> 40:52.851
by the American
Psychological Association

40:52.884 --> 40:55.854
for misrepresenting
statistics.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.956
The American Academy
of Pediatrics

40:57.989 --> 41:00.892
and The National Association
of Social Workers both agree

41:00.926 --> 41:02.894
that kids raised
in gay homes
are just as healthy

41:02.928 --> 41:04.930
as kids raised
in straight homes.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.265
Why would Mr. Decker
lie to us?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.701
To further his agenda.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.137
He wanted to use you
and Emma as an example...

41:12.170 --> 41:14.039
the damage homosexuality
is doing to society.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.877
All we wanted
was to protect Emma.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.178
[knock on door]

41:20.211 --> 41:21.880
(Benson)
Casey.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.616
Zoe wants to speak
to you.

41:24.650 --> 41:27.152
Emma, why don't we
wait outside, okay?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.625
I wanna know
why they're here.

41:33.659 --> 41:35.627
We're gonna testify
against Mr. Decker.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.696
Zoe, we're so sorry.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.098
We were only trying
to do what we thought
was best for Emma.

41:40.131 --> 41:43.101
I don't believe you.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.637
James Decker
took advantage of them...

41:45.671 --> 41:47.305
the same way
he took advantage of Emma.

41:47.338 --> 41:50.876
I know it would be hard
to forgive them.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.644
It's not going to happen.

41:52.678 --> 41:56.081
Zoe, please.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.518
She's my granddaughter.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.022
And she's my daughter.

42:04.055 --> 42:06.157
You turned my baby
against me.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.261
You convinced her
I was a child molester.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.199
How can I ever
trust you again?
