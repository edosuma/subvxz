WEBVTT

01:15.558 --> 01:18.295
No, please,
please, no, no, no!

04:47.504 --> 04:48.304
Honey, I'm home.

04:50.473 --> 04:51.673
Where are you?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.546
There you are.

05:01.484 --> 05:03.019
You had me worried for a moment.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.723
I'm afraid it's not
good news for you.

05:07.757 --> 05:09.993
In fact, it hasn't been a
good week for you, Pamela.

05:10.026 --> 05:10.860
Has it?

05:24.874 --> 05:25.707
Hmm.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.546
What am I to do with you?

05:36.886 --> 05:38.388
Just isn't working out, is it?

05:40.523 --> 05:42.624
It's a shame when you
started off so well.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.129
We really thought we were
going to be a good team.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.868
Now, of course I blame myself.

05:51.901 --> 05:54.237
I'm too compassionate, too kind.

05:55.839 --> 05:59.175
Maybe more of an aggressive
approach is what is needed.

06:00.844 --> 06:03.379
Maybe I've been going about
this the wrong way, huh?

06:05.115 --> 06:08.084
I'm starting to believe
that I might've been

06:08.118 --> 06:09.085
too easy on you.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.069
oh, Pammy, Pamela,
Pamela, oh come on.

06:26.102 --> 06:27.337
Oh, oh.

06:27.370 --> 06:28.204
It's okay.

06:29.205 --> 06:30.039
It's okay.

06:36.412 --> 06:37.247
You're a mess.

06:40.682 --> 06:42.819
Maybe we should start over.

06:42.852 --> 06:44.120
What do you say, huh?

06:44.154 --> 06:44.988
Fresh start.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.030
You know, I really
admire what he's done.

06:54.063 --> 06:54.898
I really do.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.234
It's quite a beautiful thing

06:58.268 --> 06:59.569
if you think about it.

07:03.506 --> 07:07.510
I have to admit, I'm jealous.

07:07.544 --> 07:09.512
There, I've said it.

07:13.049 --> 07:15.084
I really just have
to meet him sometime.

07:21.624 --> 07:23.660
Now, why don't we try
this again, Pamela.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.334
Now, we both know
what's gonna happen

07:31.367 --> 07:33.870
if you can't be honest with me.

07:33.903 --> 07:35.471
You know, this partnership,
isn't gonna work

07:35.505 --> 07:36.806
if you're gonna hold back.

07:37.907 --> 07:40.577
46 square miles of
land is a lot to cover.

07:42.312 --> 07:44.981
So you gotta be a little
bit more specific this time.

07:47.650 --> 07:49.686
Hey, hey.

07:52.455 --> 07:53.590
If I wouldn't know any better,

07:53.623 --> 07:55.558
I would say you're
just stalling for time.

07:57.594 --> 07:59.362
So, I've got this
all wrong, have I?

08:01.497 --> 08:03.366
If I knew where he was,

08:03.399 --> 08:05.168
I would've told you.

08:06.302 --> 08:07.503
Huh?

08:07.537 --> 08:08.838
If I
knew where he was-

08:10.006 --> 08:12.475
I'm so sorry, I apologize.

08:12.508 --> 08:13.610
My, my manners.

08:15.712 --> 08:16.512
There you go.

08:19.115 --> 08:20.183
Okay, take your time.

08:25.054 --> 08:25.888
Shhh.

08:28.224 --> 08:29.459
Remember why you're here.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.794
Yeah?

08:31.828 --> 08:32.828
What did I tell
you about begging?

08:34.831 --> 08:35.631
Sorry.

08:37.033 --> 08:39.969
Now where's the house he
took you and your friends to?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.810
I've already told
you everything.

08:47.844 --> 08:49.345
Pamela, this isn't fair.

08:49.379 --> 08:51.414
This is supposed to
be a fresh start.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.285
It's
not far from where

08:55.318 --> 08:56.653
you found his mask, I promise.

08:56.686 --> 08:57.587
So you keep saying,

08:57.620 --> 08:58.921
and yet here we are, again.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.629
I can't tell you
how disappointed I am.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.636
You feel this?

09:13.670 --> 09:15.538
You're dying, Pamela.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.877
I don't know how much
more of this you can take.

09:33.222 --> 09:34.057
Please.

09:35.759 --> 09:36.592
Please.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.631
I'm telling you the truth.

09:41.664 --> 09:46.369
I know you, but
it's just so much fun.

09:56.746 --> 09:57.647
Good morning.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.182
And thank you all for coming.

10:00.616 --> 10:04.120
My name, as I'm sure you're
all aware, is Tom Dempsey.

10:05.955 --> 10:08.391
So 10 years ago, my daughter,

10:08.424 --> 10:11.060
Sarah went on a camping
trip with her friends

10:11.928 --> 10:13.129
and she never came home.

10:15.732 --> 10:19.837
This book documents my
investigation into the murders

10:19.902 --> 10:24.874
and the years that I
spent searching for her.

10:28.511 --> 10:30.613
Over 76 people have gone missing

10:30.646 --> 10:34.517
in this area in
less than 30 years

10:34.550 --> 10:37.821
and for a town with a
population of some 6,000,

10:37.855 --> 10:40.056
that's a pretty
terrifying statistic.

10:42.358 --> 10:44.828
Only one person survived
to tell the story.

10:44.862 --> 10:49.833
So is she telling the truth
or was she responsible for the

10:51.000 --> 10:52.435
disappearance of her friends?

10:54.604 --> 10:57.808
We've all heard the Redwood
Massacre horror story.

10:57.841 --> 11:01.511
So how come the local authorities
refuse to investigate?

11:02.712 --> 11:03.881
What is it they're
not telling us?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.214
What is it they're hiding?

11:07.016 --> 11:10.386
Interesting fact number three
and probably the most salient

11:10.420 --> 11:11.587
point of this subject,

11:12.955 --> 11:15.826
none of these missing
persons have ever turned up.

11:15.859 --> 11:20.864
No bodies, no explanations,
no answers, nothing.

11:30.406 --> 11:32.642
I'm a big fan of your work.

11:32.675 --> 11:34.644
I'm very glad to hear it.

11:34.677 --> 11:36.245
Who should I make it out to?

11:36.279 --> 11:39.015
If you could make
out to Max, please.

11:39.048 --> 11:39.883
Thanks.

11:41.417 --> 11:42.452
I caught your last lecture.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.287
I found it most interesting.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.254
Most people do.

11:46.689 --> 11:48.892
It's just a pity the
people who matter

11:48.926 --> 11:51.294
tend to ignore my findings.

11:51.327 --> 11:52.662
I'm not like most people.

11:54.697 --> 11:57.033
Well, Max, like
the saying goes,

11:57.066 --> 11:59.502
the only thing necessary
for the triumph of evil

11:59.535 --> 12:01.003
is for good men to do nothing.

12:01.905 --> 12:03.406
1920, Edmund Burke.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.042
Pretty appropriate, right?

12:06.075 --> 12:08.478
Yeah, it's a
rather amusing quote.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.714
Well, there you go.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.218
I have something
I want you to see.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.486
Well, to be honest, Max,

12:16.519 --> 12:17.921
I'm a little pushed
for time right now,

12:17.955 --> 12:21.224
so maybe you could catch
me at my next signing.

12:21.257 --> 12:22.992
Judging by your
last a turnout,

12:23.025 --> 12:23.927
I don't think that's possible.

12:23.961 --> 12:25.127
I'll take my chances now.

12:26.596 --> 12:28.698
Well, I'm afraid you're
going to be disappointed.

12:33.102 --> 12:35.304
I know you want to find
them as much as I do.

12:38.074 --> 12:38.976
Okay, Max.

12:40.944 --> 12:43.546
what is it that you have
for me that's so important?

12:44.514 --> 12:47.016
Redemption, vindication,

12:48.217 --> 12:50.119
and the ending to your
next bestselling book.

12:52.789 --> 12:54.457
And how are you
going to achieve that?

12:54.490 --> 12:56.325
Well, by finding the
man who's responsible

12:56.359 --> 12:57.895
for these terrible murders.

12:59.161 --> 13:00.363
I mean, look at it this way.

13:00.396 --> 13:02.900
Tom Dempsey, the man
who proved the existence

13:02.933 --> 13:04.600
of the infamous Redwood killer.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.271
We know what the local community
thinks about your theories.

13:08.304 --> 13:09.405
You're a joke to them.

13:12.809 --> 13:13.911
I can change all that.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.327
So is this gonna take long?

13:33.764 --> 13:37.066
I'm supposed to be meeting
friends for dinner, so...

13:37.099 --> 13:37.935
Not long.

13:46.944 --> 13:48.845
I guarantee you won't
be disappointed.

13:53.016 --> 13:53.850
Come on

14:07.864 --> 14:08.664
Max.

14:16.172 --> 14:17.007
Max.

14:28.718 --> 14:29.652
I'm in here.

14:45.568 --> 14:48.237
So, who's the
couple in the photos?

14:49.238 --> 14:51.240
It's my sister's house.

14:51.273 --> 14:53.476
She's visiting friends
with her husband.

14:53.509 --> 14:54.978
I'm taking care of the place.

14:56.178 --> 14:57.279
Huh.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.348
Interesting house.

14:59.382 --> 15:00.884
It's quiet.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.151
Just the way I like it.

15:13.262 --> 15:15.032
So Max, is this
gonna take much longer?

15:15.065 --> 15:17.566
I really do have to get back.

15:26.043 --> 15:27.176
Jesus!

15:29.211 --> 15:31.114
Christ, you scared
the shit out of me.

15:32.581 --> 15:33.382
What is this?

15:33.416 --> 15:34.250
Some kind of joke?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.029
Is that what I think it is?

15:52.368 --> 15:53.904
I thought you'd never ask.

16:07.984 --> 16:08.885
She's impressive.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.055
She should be.

16:13.990 --> 16:14.891
She's my daughter.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.263
Okay, so just let me
do all the talking.

16:21.297 --> 16:22.132
Okay?

16:23.265 --> 16:25.102
We really don't want
to piss her off.

16:39.515 --> 16:40.784
Laura, we need to talk.

16:50.526 --> 16:53.629
There's something
I need to show you.

16:54.463 --> 16:55.698
Not interested.

16:57.801 --> 17:00.103
Look, I just need five
minutes of your time.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.141
Will you at least hear me out?

17:07.210 --> 17:08.044
Please?

17:09.545 --> 17:10.346
Now what?

17:16.318 --> 17:17.154
Stay here.

17:22.759 --> 17:23.592
Please?

17:31.168 --> 17:32.269
Now can we talk?

18:00.864 --> 18:03.233
And I thought I was obsessed.

18:03.266 --> 18:05.434
Where did
he say he found it?

18:05.467 --> 18:10.240
Oh, here near the old
abandoned junk yard.

18:10.273 --> 18:12.175
We searched that
area multiple times.

18:12.209 --> 18:14.610
If it was there, we
would have found it.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.913
Well, you obviously
didn't look hard enough.

18:18.681 --> 18:19.916
Why is he even here?

18:20.984 --> 18:23.153
Because he found the mask.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.387
Maybe he can help
us find the killer.

18:26.422 --> 18:27.858
It's that simple, is it?

18:29.159 --> 18:31.427
Some asshole that
you don't even know

18:31.460 --> 18:33.997
shows up with this piece of shit

18:34.030 --> 18:36.465
and you automatically
think that it's real?

18:37.334 --> 18:38.935
Have you lost your fucking mind?

18:40.070 --> 18:41.637
Oh, it's real.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.907
Oh, and you
just found it lying about.

18:43.940 --> 18:45.608
How convenient.

18:45.641 --> 18:47.911
It matches the description.

18:47.944 --> 18:50.379
So what, what
difference does it make?

18:50.412 --> 18:51.614
Sarah's dead.

18:51.647 --> 18:53.749
Dad, I'm sorry, but
it's time to move on.

18:53.783 --> 18:55.252
Well, I can't.

18:55.285 --> 18:56.119
Okay?

18:57.087 --> 18:58.989
I'm surprised that you can.

18:59.022 --> 18:59.823
You know what?

18:59.856 --> 19:01.191
That's not fair.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.759
Your right.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.660
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.135
It's just we've come so far.

19:12.168 --> 19:16.273
We've covered so much ground
over the years and we're close.

19:17.874 --> 19:18.775
I can feel it.

19:22.379 --> 19:23.612
The mask was found here.

19:25.015 --> 19:28.084
Not only corroborates
what Pamela said happened

19:28.118 --> 19:29.551
to her and her friends,

19:29.585 --> 19:32.088
but it also means we're
dealing with a real person,

19:32.122 --> 19:33.356
a serial killer.

19:35.658 --> 19:37.160
Okay, let's just,

19:37.193 --> 19:38.962
let's just say for
argument's sake

19:38.995 --> 19:42.132
that I believe all
of this bullshit.

19:42.165 --> 19:44.433
Do you think he's just going
to be sitting there waiting for

19:44.466 --> 19:45.668
us to find him?

19:45.701 --> 19:47.938
I mean, whoever did this
as long gone by now.

19:47.971 --> 19:49.638
What if he's not?

19:49.672 --> 19:51.174
Hmmm?

19:51.207 --> 19:53.977
Don't you think we owe it to
your sister to at least try.

19:55.211 --> 19:57.047
I have to agree
with your dad on that.

19:58.181 --> 19:59.416
You know, if I
wanted your opinion,

19:59.448 --> 20:00.649
I would have asked for it.

20:00.683 --> 20:02.118
Just keep out of this.

20:02.152 --> 20:04.821
What if they've just all been
looking in the wrong places?

20:04.854 --> 20:05.654
What if,

20:06.790 --> 20:10.060
what if this thing
was just branching out

20:10.093 --> 20:12.062
from one specific location?

20:12.095 --> 20:14.230
Something that we missed.

20:14.264 --> 20:16.166
This is ridiculous.

20:16.199 --> 20:19.202
You're not going back out there.

20:19.235 --> 20:20.403
What's the one place

20:20.437 --> 20:22.405
that we've never been
allowed to search?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.308
Oh, no.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.177
Not gonna happen.

20:28.378 --> 20:30.512
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

20:30.546 --> 20:32.614
What's he talking about?

20:32.648 --> 20:37.653
He's talking about an
old abandoned RAF base

20:38.554 --> 20:40.890
at the far end of the forest

20:40.924 --> 20:44.327
that our hero here got himself
locked up for two weeks

20:44.361 --> 20:47.629
the last time that he pulled
this stunt on trespass charges.

20:48.564 --> 20:50.233
Let me try again.

20:50.266 --> 20:52.002
It's a two day trek.

20:52.035 --> 20:53.303
You'll never make it.

20:54.536 --> 20:55.704
Not alone he won't.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.641
Oh no.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.111
Don't even think about it.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.217
No way.

21:10.754 --> 21:12.255
He found that with the mask.

21:13.589 --> 21:15.291
I can assure you,
it's quite real.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.662
What more proof do you need?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.198
I'm not going back out there.

21:22.232 --> 21:23.366
I'm sorry.

21:35.078 --> 21:37.981
I just need you to
trust me one more time.

21:38.014 --> 21:40.784
Regardless of whether you
believe he exists or not,

21:43.453 --> 21:45.221
because I can't do
this without you.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.632
Max, it's Tom.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.969
Good news, she's in.

22:33.002 --> 22:35.939
Meet us at the Redwood
trail, tomorrow six a.m.

22:35.972 --> 22:38.575
Max, make sure
you come prepared.

23:12.775 --> 23:16.946
Looks like I'm
going to have to leave you.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.986
Can't thank you and your
wife enough for your

23:23.019 --> 23:24.821
first-class hospitality.

23:26.189 --> 23:27.891
Truly has been a pleasure.

23:30.460 --> 23:31.327
Hey, look at me.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.832
I said look at me.

23:40.403 --> 23:41.804
I'm doing this to honor her.

24:13.770 --> 24:16.773
So I took the Liberty
of repacking your bag.

24:16.806 --> 24:18.641
Are you sure you've
done this before?

24:19.676 --> 24:21.611
Can't say that I was impressed.

24:21.644 --> 24:22.979
You went through my stuff?

24:23.012 --> 24:24.447
Like I said,

24:24.480 --> 24:26.783
I don't know you and I
certainly don't trust you,

24:26.816 --> 24:30.019
but on this trip you listen
to me because I'm in charge.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.322
Whatever you say.

24:33.456 --> 24:34.290
Great.

24:49.839 --> 24:51.074
Are you looking for this?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.846
Like I said, I don't trust you.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.582
It's for protection.

25:02.685 --> 25:03.486
Don't worry.

25:04.454 --> 25:05.788
We've got that covered.

25:08.224 --> 25:09.759
So you all set?

25:09.792 --> 25:11.194
What did she mean by that?

25:12.328 --> 25:13.596
You really didn't
think we'd come out here

25:13.630 --> 25:14.464
alone, did you?

25:16.799 --> 25:18.334
Don't worry, Max.

25:18.368 --> 25:19.469
You're gonna love him.

25:42.592 --> 25:43.559
We lost already.

25:45.561 --> 25:46.429
Problem?

25:46.462 --> 25:48.197
No, no problem.

25:48.231 --> 25:49.432
Just a shortcut.

25:52.101 --> 25:53.936
I suggest you change
your footwear.

25:56.439 --> 25:57.273
Why?

26:01.244 --> 26:03.146
How you doing, Max?

26:03.179 --> 26:04.714
Did tell you to come prepared.

26:06.149 --> 26:07.383
Well, if I would've known
we'd be crossing streams.

26:07.417 --> 26:09.152
I would've brought something.

26:09.185 --> 26:11.254
Ah, come on, a
little cold water

26:11.287 --> 26:13.056
is not gonna hurt a
tough guy, like you.

26:14.023 --> 26:15.759
Ha ha ha.

26:26.269 --> 26:27.805
Should've been here by now.

26:30.907 --> 26:31.741
Hey.

26:33.409 --> 26:35.545
I see you took the scenic route.

26:35.578 --> 26:37.046
You know me.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.848
Just trying to keep
it interesting.

26:39.817 --> 26:41.150
Probably
took a shortcut.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.618
Hey, don't blame me.

26:42.652 --> 26:44.087
She's the boss.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.221
I just do as I'm told.

26:47.623 --> 26:49.559
I see you're still
fucking with the new guys.

26:50.426 --> 26:51.260
Good to see you.

26:52.128 --> 26:53.863
Jen it's been too long.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.500
Thank you so much
for doing this.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.901
You know me, Tom,

26:58.935 --> 27:00.970
I'll never stop looking.

27:01.003 --> 27:02.773
Besides sounds like this trip

27:02.806 --> 27:04.340
is gonna be a little different.

27:04.374 --> 27:05.208
We hope so.

27:07.577 --> 27:09.278
So that's the mysterious Max.

27:12.148 --> 27:13.751
You never told me
how hot he was.

27:15.618 --> 27:18.454
Hi, I'm Jennifer.

27:19.722 --> 27:20.723
Welcome to the team.

27:22.358 --> 27:25.128
You guys do know that even if
we don't find anything else,

27:25.161 --> 27:27.897
that mask is enough to get
the police involved again.

27:27.930 --> 27:29.833
I promise you we'll go
straight to the police

27:29.867 --> 27:31.067
as soon as we get back.

27:33.236 --> 27:34.070
Can I see it?

27:38.040 --> 27:39.909
So it fits the
description perfectly.

27:39.942 --> 27:42.311
I mean, we're pretty
certain, it's the real deal.

27:42.345 --> 27:44.447
Or so my father believes so.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.083
I'm not so certain.

27:51.988 --> 27:55.725
Jesus, this is fucked up.

27:58.762 --> 27:59.595
What is it?

28:01.531 --> 28:02.365
Stay here.

28:36.165 --> 28:37.266
Almost had you, Laura.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.335
You're getting sloppy, girl.

28:39.368 --> 28:40.536
You're getting loud.

28:42.738 --> 28:46.642
Oh, I think you
broke my fucking nose.

28:46.676 --> 28:47.577
Good.

28:47.610 --> 28:49.412
Better than your fucking neck.

28:49.445 --> 28:50.646
You little Badger.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.215
Get over here and
give big Gus a hug.

28:53.516 --> 28:54.650
Back together again,
just like old times.

28:54.684 --> 28:55.819
That's what I'm afraid of.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.055
You know, I'm not as
stealthy as I used to be.

28:59.088 --> 29:02.158
Yeah, I can smell that bad
cologne like a mile away.

29:05.194 --> 29:07.764
Look who I found
loitering in the forest.

29:07.798 --> 29:10.299
There he is.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.468
Late as always.

29:12.502 --> 29:14.237
Hey, if I started
turning up early,

29:14.270 --> 29:15.806
you'd get suspicious.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.406
Who the hell is this guy?

29:17.440 --> 29:18.674
That's our protection.

29:20.643 --> 29:21.812
Jennie, baby.

29:21.845 --> 29:24.113
You are a sight for
sore eyes, girl.

29:24.146 --> 29:25.014
You got that right.

29:26.449 --> 29:27.416
You feel good?

29:27.450 --> 29:28.384
You been working out?

29:28.417 --> 29:29.619
I have, thank you.

29:29.652 --> 29:30.854
And I know what you're thinking.

29:30.888 --> 29:31.889
Don't, ain't gonna happen.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.357
I understand, I understand.

29:34.390 --> 29:36.092
You're afraid you're gonna
fall in love with me.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.393
It's understandable.

29:37.426 --> 29:40.263
Tom, how you doing, man?

29:40.296 --> 29:41.130
I like the hair.

29:42.131 --> 29:43.533
It's good to see you, Gus.

29:43.566 --> 29:45.401
Hey, where's the
rest of the group?

29:45.434 --> 29:46.636
We're all that's left.

29:48.104 --> 29:50.473
You know, it kind of feels
like no one cares anymore.

29:51.507 --> 29:52.475
Well, shit, man.

29:53.911 --> 29:56.078
I'm glad I brought a few
of my good friends with me

29:56.112 --> 29:57.580
to even out the odds.

29:57.613 --> 29:58.748
Shit.

29:58.782 --> 29:59.783
Please
tell me you didn't.

29:59.816 --> 30:01.050
You better believe it, baby.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.352
Big Bubba wasn't staying
home for this party.

30:05.254 --> 30:08.157
Jesus Christ, Gus.

30:08.190 --> 30:11.360
You are one crazy
son of a bitch.

30:12.896 --> 30:15.064
You get caught with that
thing, you are on your own.

30:15.097 --> 30:16.833
He's the one that
said come prepared.

30:16.867 --> 30:18.234
It's getting a
little out of hand.

30:18.267 --> 30:19.101
It's Gus.

30:19.135 --> 30:20.102
What do you expect?

30:28.344 --> 30:29.846
You must be Max.

30:40.356 --> 30:41.524
I don't know, Tom.

30:41.557 --> 30:42.725
Looks a little
shady if you ask me.

30:43.659 --> 30:44.594
It's funny.

30:44.627 --> 30:45.829
Tom never mentioned you at all.

30:46.997 --> 30:48.264
Play nice, Gus.

30:48.297 --> 30:49.532
He's one of the team.

30:54.905 --> 30:55.973
Are you, pretty boy?

30:57.841 --> 30:59.009
Are you one of the team?

31:01.444 --> 31:03.279
Oooh, got a tough guy here, huh?

31:07.416 --> 31:08.517
You trust him, Tom?

31:11.187 --> 31:12.856
He is the reason
we're all here

31:17.259 --> 31:19.428
I said do you trust him?

31:20.964 --> 31:21.798
Yeah.

31:23.132 --> 31:23.967
I trust him.

31:34.176 --> 31:37.380
Well then it's all
right by me, huh?

31:39.448 --> 31:40.817
Make no mistake
about it, pretty boy.

31:40.851 --> 31:42.151
I'm gonna be watching you.

31:45.554 --> 31:48.992
All right, enough
of the macho bullshit.

31:49.026 --> 31:49.826
Come on.

31:49.860 --> 31:50.660
We gotta get going.

31:52.029 --> 31:53.262
Just fucking with him.

31:53.295 --> 31:55.197
Jeez, when did you
get so serious?

31:55.231 --> 31:58.701
You're such an asshole.

31:58.734 --> 31:59.535
Hey, I've got something
even bigger than this

31:59.568 --> 32:00.503
if you're interested.

32:01.370 --> 32:02.304
Yeah, right.

32:02.338 --> 32:03.907
Come on, talk to me.

32:03.940 --> 32:04.841
Gus.

32:04.875 --> 32:05.574
Let me show you my etchings.

32:05.608 --> 32:06.409
Man.

32:07.376 --> 32:08.577
You're so disgusting, Gus.

32:09.946 --> 32:11.148
Party time.

32:12.715 --> 32:13.950
Gus, glad to
see your tradition

32:13.984 --> 32:16.987
of not bringing a tent
is still going strong.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.723
Bag of guns, box of condoms.

32:20.757 --> 32:22.558
All I need for this trip.

32:22.591 --> 32:25.461
And before you ask, yes,
I plan on using them.

32:26.897 --> 32:30.399
Remind me again why we
keep inviting this guy?

32:59.695 --> 33:01.898
We'll camp here for the night.

33:01.932 --> 33:02.766
Let's try and get some rest.

33:02.799 --> 33:03.900
We leave at sunrise.

33:05.102 --> 33:07.003
Why does it always
have to be so early?

33:28.257 --> 33:29.159
You okay?

33:30.593 --> 33:31.427
Sure.

33:32.796 --> 33:34.898
We just need to make up
for lost time tomorrow.

33:34.931 --> 33:37.934
We should hit the base by midday
if we can pick up the pace.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.208
Where's Gus?

33:46.810 --> 33:47.710
I don't know.

33:47.743 --> 33:48.879
He was right here a second ago.

34:00.623 --> 34:01.858
Campers.

34:01.892 --> 34:04.060
Don't worry about
the Durham ravine.

34:05.962 --> 34:08.031
I've never seen 'em
in this far before.

34:11.101 --> 34:12.803
Seems like we're
not the only ones

34:14.303 --> 34:15.138
who want to meet the boogeyman.

34:29.953 --> 34:31.922
Interesting choice for a gun.

34:31.955 --> 34:32.889
She may be old,

34:35.456 --> 34:37.960
but Mary Lee, she
goes everywhere I go.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.460
It's sort of a tradition now.

34:40.864 --> 34:42.498
Mary Lee.

34:42.531 --> 34:43.565
Yeah, she's cold.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.770
She's precise.

34:50.072 --> 34:52.775
You get in her way, she'll
blow your fucking head off.

34:57.981 --> 35:00.382
I named her after my ex-wife.

35:06.589 --> 35:08.124
But don't you worry.

35:08.158 --> 35:12.728
I got ma and pa for
backup just in case.

35:20.136 --> 35:22.705
On that note,
I'm going to bed.

35:22.738 --> 35:23.539
You keep the bed warm.

35:23.572 --> 35:24.673
I'll be in in a minute.

35:26.943 --> 35:28.311
I love a woman who
plays hard to get.

35:28.345 --> 35:29.346
Makes me horny.

35:53.169 --> 35:54.536
So what's your story.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.143
Read your dad's book

36:00.176 --> 36:02.779
and found the story intriguing.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.546
Just, you know.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.547
Cut the bullshit.

36:06.715 --> 36:08.417
My dad may have
bought your crap,

36:08.450 --> 36:10.820
but I don't buy it for a second.

36:10.854 --> 36:12.355
Why are you really here, Max.

36:16.993 --> 36:19.428
My brother went
missing out here.

36:19.461 --> 36:20.696
Went into this forest

36:20.729 --> 36:22.165
about two years ago
and never came back.

36:24.301 --> 36:27.703
I heard about this group of
family members that never gave

36:27.736 --> 36:29.239
up the search.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.374
Read your dad's book,
made the connection.

36:32.275 --> 36:33.376
Thought I oughta help.

36:34.543 --> 36:35.378
Here I am.

36:36.913 --> 36:37.713
I'm just like you.

36:37.746 --> 36:38.681
Just want answers.

36:42.752 --> 36:44.254
Why didn't you say anything?

36:45.654 --> 36:47.157
You never asked.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.627
You sure you know what
you're getting yourself

36:51.660 --> 36:52.661
involved with?

36:53.729 --> 36:54.798
Are you?

37:25.261 --> 37:27.097
Sleep tight.

38:14.444 --> 38:17.047
I thought this was supposed
to be a military base.

38:19.615 --> 38:20.817
She's right, Tom.

38:20.850 --> 38:22.318
We must have made a
wrong turn back there.

38:30.493 --> 38:31.693
What do you think?

38:31.727 --> 38:32.628
I'm thinking this
shouldn't be here.

38:32.661 --> 38:34.764
We still have four miles to go.

38:44.074 --> 38:45.475
Max, don't.

38:51.147 --> 38:51.981
This is it.

39:02.492 --> 39:03.259
Stay here.

39:03.293 --> 39:04.094
I'll check it out.

39:31.521 --> 39:32.555
There's nobody here.

39:33.823 --> 39:34.824
This place is empty.

39:48.838 --> 39:50.073
He's right.

39:50.106 --> 39:51.274
This place has been
abandoned for years.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.309
It doesn't make any sense.

39:53.343 --> 39:54.511
This can't be the base.

39:54.544 --> 39:55.378
It's not.

39:56.712 --> 39:58.114
Then where the hell is it?

39:58.982 --> 40:00.283
We're standing on it?

40:16.466 --> 40:17.267
Whoo!

40:19.569 --> 40:20.770
Jackpot, baby.

40:22.305 --> 40:23.439
What the
hell am I looking at?

40:23.473 --> 40:24.274
It's the way in.

40:24.307 --> 40:26.009
Way into what?

40:26.042 --> 40:27.310
Base is underground.

40:28.845 --> 40:30.146
This shit just got real.

40:34.851 --> 40:36.753
Somebody left the
back door open.

41:10.719 --> 41:11.588
She'll be fine.

41:13.156 --> 41:15.058
She's not the one
I'm worried about.

41:48.191 --> 41:51.561
Laura, everything okay?

41:51.594 --> 41:53.630
I'm fine.

41:53.663 --> 41:55.131
Just stay up there.

43:38.868 --> 43:39.702
Hey, guys!

43:42.705 --> 43:44.574
Hey, I'm locked in here.

43:49.946 --> 43:53.649
Oh, shit.

44:26.682 --> 44:27.683
Boogey boogey.

44:27.717 --> 44:29.118
Jesus Christ, Gus.

44:29.152 --> 44:30.553
You scared the shit out of me.

44:30.586 --> 44:31.822
No way you're gonna
have all the fun

44:31.855 --> 44:32.989
down here by yourself, baby?

44:33.022 --> 44:34.323
I'm coming with you.

44:34.357 --> 44:35.158
No, no, no.

44:35.191 --> 44:36.025
It automatically locks.

44:42.999 --> 44:45.101
That was close.

44:52.175 --> 44:53.242
What the hell is this place?

44:53.276 --> 44:54.410
I don't know,

44:54.444 --> 44:55.945
but I heard something
from down there.

44:57.213 --> 44:58.948
Just hearing things.

44:58.981 --> 44:59.850
This is a bad idea.

44:59.883 --> 45:00.884
We should just go.

45:02.418 --> 45:03.619
I'm not coming
all the way out here

45:03.653 --> 45:05.221
and leaving empty handed.

45:09.158 --> 45:10.193
Goddamn it, Gus.

45:12.830 --> 45:15.364
I thought you said
this place was abandoned.

45:15.398 --> 45:16.232
It is.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.268
Then how come
the lights are on?

45:19.302 --> 45:20.136
Good question.

45:23.306 --> 45:25.241
I knew I should've
brought Big Bubba.

45:37.153 --> 45:38.054
What do you think?

45:40.156 --> 45:42.826
I think we should go back
and get the others first.

45:44.994 --> 45:46.295
Come on, I got this.

45:58.574 --> 45:59.709
Ladies first.

46:15.859 --> 46:17.861
What the hell is this?

46:30.874 --> 46:32.041
What the hell?

46:59.903 --> 47:02.071
You gotta come see this.

47:24.694 --> 47:29.699
That's a human eyeball.

47:38.107 --> 47:39.208
What is this?

47:50.219 --> 47:51.320
That's a human dick.

47:57.126 --> 47:58.427
I think it's time to go.

48:04.200 --> 48:05.568
It might be the others.

48:05.601 --> 48:06.803
What if it's not?

48:10.239 --> 48:11.074
Stay here.

49:08.999 --> 49:10.033
It's okay, it's all clear.

49:10.067 --> 49:11.034
Just an old door.

49:13.469 --> 49:15.172
You think that's what
you heard last time?

49:15.204 --> 49:17.007
I don't know.

49:17.040 --> 49:17.874
I think so.

49:20.110 --> 49:20.944
I hope so.

49:40.596 --> 49:43.566
All right, we've
got something here.

49:57.279 --> 49:59.116
What the hell is this?

50:15.031 --> 50:17.366
What the fuck is all this?

50:55.839 --> 50:57.808
There's blood on this.

51:28.337 --> 51:29.239
I've seen this guy.

51:29.272 --> 51:30.774
He's been missing for years.

51:36.980 --> 51:37.881
Whoa man.

51:49.725 --> 51:51.228
Check out the background.

52:00.937 --> 52:02.404
What do you think?

52:06.675 --> 52:08.345
You got ma and pa?

52:13.283 --> 52:14.117
Yeah.

52:17.686 --> 52:18.554
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

52:18.587 --> 52:19.421
It's us.

52:21.624 --> 52:24.294
I thought I told
you to stay outside.

52:24.327 --> 52:26.296
We can't find Max.

52:26.329 --> 52:27.696
What do you mean
you can't find him?

52:27.730 --> 52:28.932
He followed you down.

52:28.965 --> 52:30.399
We couldn't stop him.

52:30.432 --> 52:33.435
Laura, he was
acting really strange.

52:57.526 --> 52:58.427
What is all this?

53:03.632 --> 53:06.036
You were right, Tom.

53:06.069 --> 53:08.737
You were right about everything.

53:23.186 --> 53:24.287
Protection.

53:25.454 --> 53:27.489
What the hell am I
going to do with this?

53:27.523 --> 53:28.792
Have you lost your mind?

53:32.829 --> 53:33.629
You're right.

53:33.662 --> 53:35.065
What was I thinking?

53:36.166 --> 53:37.000
You happy?

53:45.375 --> 53:47.077
Just point and shoot.

53:47.110 --> 53:47.911
You understand?

53:53.016 --> 53:55.452
What the hell's going on?

53:55.484 --> 53:56.820
You just stay close to me.

53:56.853 --> 53:58.355
You'll be fine, I promise you.

54:00.156 --> 54:00.991
Wait.

54:02.425 --> 54:05.028
What was it that you guys
saw in the other room?

54:05.061 --> 54:06.296
You don't want to know?

54:07.696 --> 54:08.597
Why would Max do that?

54:08.630 --> 54:09.598
If it wasn't him,

54:09.631 --> 54:11.567
somebody else closed that door.

54:13.403 --> 54:15.671
We have to keep
moving forward.

54:15.704 --> 54:16.940
There's gotta be another exit.

54:16.973 --> 54:18.574
You've seen what's back there.

54:23.712 --> 54:25.382
I don't think
we have a choice.

54:44.067 --> 54:46.336
I have something for you.

54:47.603 --> 54:48.438
A gift.

55:00.884 --> 55:02.385
Now you can be complete again.

55:04.054 --> 55:06.222
I'm looking forward to
meeting you in person.

56:28.538 --> 56:30.607
No, no, please, please.

56:35.578 --> 56:36.846
No, no, please.

56:39.349 --> 56:40.450
Please don't.

56:47.190 --> 56:48.091
No, please.

56:52.929 --> 56:53.763
No.

57:00.736 --> 57:01.638
No, please.

57:05.375 --> 57:06.643
No, please, no!

57:43.079 --> 57:44.447
Shit.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.516
This is no military bunker.

57:46.549 --> 57:51.521
This is some kind of
underground prison.

57:53.356 --> 57:54.357
Yeah, but for who?

57:56.626 --> 57:57.460
Jesus.

58:00.597 --> 58:01.564
This place is huge.

58:07.237 --> 58:08.805
What are you thinking, Laura?

58:12.909 --> 58:15.778
I'm thinking we need to make
sure we're alone before we go

58:15.812 --> 58:16.713
any further.

58:27.991 --> 58:29.325
What the fuck?

58:32.695 --> 58:34.097
Holy shit.

58:47.510 --> 58:49.812
Why would they build
this underground?

58:49.846 --> 58:50.680
Who knows?

58:52.448 --> 58:53.349
Whatever they were doing here,

58:53.383 --> 58:54.984
they didn't want anyone to know.

58:56.119 --> 58:57.353
My thoughts exactly.

59:05.061 --> 59:06.362
Where are you?

59:29.085 --> 59:30.586
All right, we got something.

59:30.620 --> 59:32.188
We got something.

59:32.221 --> 59:34.290
We something going on.

59:34.324 --> 59:35.158
All right.

01:00:04.153 --> 01:00:06.923
It's a fucking
graveyard up here.

01:00:06.956 --> 01:00:09.125
This isn't a prison.

01:00:09.158 --> 01:00:11.060
We got
bodies everywhere.

01:00:12.495 --> 01:00:14.832
You're not gonna believe
what I found in this folder.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.882
What the fuck is that?

01:00:43.726 --> 01:00:46.596
These guys didn't
stand a chance.

01:00:46.629 --> 01:00:47.430
Fuck.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.901
What a way to go.

01:00:58.474 --> 01:00:59.777
That's him.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:00.610
Isn't it?

01:01:03.146 --> 01:01:04.480
Well?

01:01:04.514 --> 01:01:05.415
I don't understand it.

01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:06.884
What am I even looking?

01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:11.254
It looks like they were
experimenting on these things.

01:01:11.287 --> 01:01:13.189
What the fuck is that?

01:01:13.222 --> 01:01:15.158
This whole place
is it's some kind of

01:01:15.191 --> 01:01:16.659
experimental hospital.

01:01:16.692 --> 01:01:18.127
What are you saying?

01:01:18.161 --> 01:01:20.062
I'm saying, I think we
may have found our killers.

01:01:20.096 --> 01:01:22.465
Government's been doing
shit like this for years.

01:01:22.498 --> 01:01:24.300
They all have
military IDs too.

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.635
Look, read it.

01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:26.969
It's all in the documents.

01:01:27.838 --> 01:01:29.405
What about all these bodies?

01:01:33.643 --> 01:01:35.846
What happened to
all the patients?

01:01:43.719 --> 01:01:44.554
You okay.

01:01:47.423 --> 01:01:48.424
What do you think?

01:01:53.529 --> 01:01:55.498
I know this is messed up, but

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:58.534
we're gonna get out of this.

01:01:58.568 --> 01:01:59.368
I promise you.

01:02:03.406 --> 01:02:05.274
No one knows we're
down here, Gus.

01:02:10.546 --> 01:02:12.381
Hey, I'll shoot my way
out of here if I have to.

01:02:12.415 --> 01:02:13.249
You know me,

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.087
Gus, I need your help.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.322
Just give me a second.

01:02:25.728 --> 01:02:29.599
Sit tight, get
your shit together.

01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:39.542
I'm gonna get us out.

01:03:06.235 --> 01:03:07.637
Jennifer.

01:03:32.662 --> 01:03:33.496
Jennifer.

01:03:36.599 --> 01:03:37.433
Max?

01:03:40.469 --> 01:03:41.304
Max?

01:03:58.287 --> 01:03:59.689
Jennifer.

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:01.424
Max?

01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:47.536
All right, go
ahead and try it.

01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.090
Most of the breakers are shot.

01:05:07.124 --> 01:05:09.325
If this place goes
dark, we're in trouble.

01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:11.727
Backup power is the
best we're gonna do.

01:05:11.762 --> 01:05:13.964
Hey, we need to find a
communication's room.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.499
There's gotta be a hard
line to the outside world.

01:05:25.075 --> 01:05:27.844
How much longer before
we lose light completely?

01:05:27.878 --> 01:05:29.046
It's hard to tell.

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:31.048
That hunk of junk up
there's a diesel engine.

01:05:31.081 --> 01:05:32.783
Somebody been keeping it going.

01:06:02.946 --> 01:06:03.780
Hey!

01:06:52.628 --> 01:06:54.263
Okay, that's messed up.

01:06:54.296 --> 01:06:56.398
She couldn't have gone far.

01:06:56.432 --> 01:06:57.234
Forget about her.

01:06:57.266 --> 01:06:58.869
We got her own problems.

01:06:58.902 --> 01:07:00.636
She might know the way out.

01:07:00.669 --> 01:07:01.772
Yeah.

01:07:01.805 --> 01:07:03.106
She also might be responsible

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.208
for that guy hanging
on that chain.

01:07:05.242 --> 01:07:07.077
Fuck her and fuck Max.

01:07:35.337 --> 01:07:38.108
Max, what the
fuck is going on?

01:07:41.812 --> 01:07:45.282
Max, what the fuck
are you doing to me?

01:07:45.314 --> 01:07:46.783
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:49.652
Fuck.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.721
You should feel honored.

01:07:55.025 --> 01:07:57.060
I wanted you to be the first.

01:07:57.093 --> 01:07:59.695
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:08:10.606 --> 01:08:12.209
I wonder what he'll do to you.

01:08:17.746 --> 01:08:19.348
So many wonderful possibilities.

01:08:29.524 --> 01:08:30.593
No, please.

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:39.102
Please, please.

01:08:50.578 --> 01:08:54.084
I'm not the one you
have to worry about.

01:09:01.925 --> 01:09:03.260
Don't worry.

01:09:03.292 --> 01:09:04.194
I'll be watching.

01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:07.296
No, Max, please.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.163
Please help me.

01:09:10.733 --> 01:09:12.769
Max, please, come back.

01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:13.636
Please.

01:09:16.372 --> 01:09:17.874
Please, come back.

01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:21.609
Don't leave me here, please.

01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:22.879
Max, come back.

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.613
Please help me.

01:09:25.648 --> 01:09:29.484
Please, I won't say anything.

01:09:29.518 --> 01:09:30.353
I promise.

01:09:43.532 --> 01:09:48.537
Oh, no.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:50.974
Oh God.

01:09:54.411 --> 01:09:55.245
No, God.

01:10:29.578 --> 01:10:30.546
What's your name?

01:10:32.082 --> 01:10:33.383
Donna.

01:10:33.416 --> 01:10:34.317
Donna Ingram.

01:10:34.351 --> 01:10:35.919
Donna, I'm Laura.

01:10:35.952 --> 01:10:37.020
And this is Gus.

01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:41.024
Please, you gotta get
me out of this place.

01:10:41.057 --> 01:10:42.058
Okay, you're safe now.

01:10:42.092 --> 01:10:44.027
Just take a deep breath.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.428
Just try and relax.

01:10:45.462 --> 01:10:47.364
How'd you find this place?

01:10:47.397 --> 01:10:48.664
We were just camping.

01:10:49.799 --> 01:10:51.434
He killed my husband.

01:10:52.836 --> 01:10:53.702
Who did?

01:11:00.443 --> 01:11:02.412
You really have
no idea, do you?

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.785
You're going to die down here.

01:11:26.136 --> 01:11:28.104
What do you think?

01:11:28.138 --> 01:11:29.705
You believe that bullshit?

01:11:31.573 --> 01:11:35.945
I don't know, I don't know
what to believe anymore.

01:11:35.979 --> 01:11:38.214
We can't trust
that crazy lady.

01:11:38.248 --> 01:11:39.082
She's lying.

01:11:41.683 --> 01:11:43.453
Maybe she's just scared.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.155
You tell me.

01:11:46.356 --> 01:11:48.825
Who's camping with
high heels on?

01:11:48.858 --> 01:11:50.026
Oh shit.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.161
Why would she lie?

01:11:53.196 --> 01:11:56.266
There's always
one way to find out.

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:08.710
I knew we should've
brought more guns.

01:12:22.225 --> 01:12:23.059
Max.

01:12:28.031 --> 01:12:30.100
Where the hell have you been?

01:12:30.133 --> 01:12:31.134
You seen the others?

01:12:35.138 --> 01:12:35.972
You okay.

01:12:40.243 --> 01:12:41.077
Max, talk to me.

01:13:20.283 --> 01:13:21.117
Max.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.474
Laura?

01:16:30.039 --> 01:16:31.941
Come on, Gus, you big

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:36.145
beautiful crazy fuck,

01:16:36.179 --> 01:16:38.181
what have you got for me?

01:16:38.214 --> 01:16:39.549
Fuck.

01:16:48.324 --> 01:16:49.158
Jen.

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:23.292
Fuck.

01:17:27.296 --> 01:17:29.966
Get it together,
Tom, get it together.

01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:54.892
You sure you can get
that thing to work?

01:17:56.392 --> 01:17:57.593
It might take a while.

01:17:59.495 --> 01:18:00.329
This thing's old.

01:18:09.405 --> 01:18:11.207
I should be able to get
this thing up and running

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.408
if the power holds.

01:18:13.609 --> 01:18:14.444
I'm gonna go back
and get the others.

01:18:14.477 --> 01:18:15.311
Okay?

01:19:25.983 --> 01:19:26.817
Dad?

01:23:17.713 --> 01:23:18.681
Please be advised,

01:23:18.714 --> 01:23:19.682
unauthorized use
of this terminal

01:23:19.715 --> 01:23:20.984
is a federal offense.

01:23:26.522 --> 01:23:27.758
Please be advised.

01:23:35.397 --> 01:23:36.233
Hello.

01:23:37.733 --> 01:23:38.969
Is there...

01:23:39.002 --> 01:23:39.836
Fuck.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.474
Shit.

01:23:45.508 --> 01:23:46.877
Fuck!

01:23:50.579 --> 01:23:52.414
I want you to see something.

01:23:52.448 --> 01:23:55.518
I booked the best seats
in the house just for you.

01:23:55.551 --> 01:23:56.853
This is gonna be glorious.

01:24:02.259 --> 01:24:03.325
Incredible, isn't he?

01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:13.536
Stay with me.

01:24:34.257 --> 01:24:35.691
It's an inspiring
choice of weapon.

01:24:35.724 --> 01:24:37.961
You oughta be taking notes.

01:24:51.241 --> 01:24:52.142
Come on.

01:24:52.175 --> 01:24:54.211
Keep watching, keep watching.

01:24:54.244 --> 01:24:55.912
Don't want to miss a thing.

01:24:55.946 --> 01:24:57.113
That's all the details.

01:25:25.909 --> 01:25:27.376
Wow.

01:25:27.409 --> 01:25:29.312
What a beautiful death.

01:25:33.884 --> 01:25:36.152
You ought to be proud of that.

01:25:51.234 --> 01:25:53.502
So what now, you sick fuck?

01:25:54.603 --> 01:25:56.705
Honestly, I
haven't decided yet.

01:25:57.974 --> 01:25:59.876
Why should he have
all the fun, right?

01:26:01.278 --> 01:26:02.645
I mean, after all, I have
still have your moron

01:26:02.678 --> 01:26:04.080
of a friend to offer to him.

01:26:05.148 --> 01:26:07.549
I'm gonna enjoy
watching that fool die.

01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:08.785
Mind you?

01:26:08.818 --> 01:26:10.653
Not as much as watching
Jennifer being gutted

01:26:10.686 --> 01:26:11.755
like the pig she was.

01:26:14.057 --> 01:26:17.961
Ah, you didn't know
about that, did you?

01:26:19.863 --> 01:26:21.164
Whoops.

01:26:21.197 --> 01:26:22.299
Spoiler alert.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.269
She kept begging
me to let her go.

01:26:26.303 --> 01:26:27.137
Quite pathetic.

01:26:28.238 --> 01:26:29.839
That slut got what she deserved.

01:26:31.473 --> 01:26:32.809
Your dad, on the other hand,

01:26:32.842 --> 01:26:34.177
I felt bad for him.

01:26:35.644 --> 01:26:38.447
Imagine having a daughter
that doesn't believe you.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.250
It's quite pathetic.

01:26:40.283 --> 01:26:41.751
Fuck you.

01:26:43.386 --> 01:26:45.889
You caused him much more
pain than I ever could.

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.293
Guess we're not that
different after all.

01:26:50.327 --> 01:26:51.161
Ah, ah.

01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:55.464
Careful, Laura.

01:26:55.497 --> 01:26:58.335
I don't want to shoot
you, but I will.

01:27:00.236 --> 01:27:01.438
I just feel like your death

01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:03.907
should be a little
bit more memorable.

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:04.841
I mean a bullet,

01:27:04.874 --> 01:27:07.243
that's freaking impersonally.

01:27:08.311 --> 01:27:09.813
I really want you to enjoy it.

01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:12.082
Now, an ax.

01:27:13.515 --> 01:27:17.053
I think that would be
great for both of us.

01:27:18.188 --> 01:27:19.555
Think I'm gonna
start with your legs.

01:27:19.588 --> 01:27:21.291
You won't need
them anyway, right?

01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:24.493
I feel sorry for you, Max.

01:27:29.766 --> 01:27:31.067
I didn't know you cared.

01:27:32.102 --> 01:27:33.236
I mean, by all means.

01:27:33.269 --> 01:27:35.537
Let me know why, I'm all ears.

01:27:36.705 --> 01:27:39.909
I've been on to you
from the very beginning.

01:27:41.878 --> 01:27:43.579
You almost had me
with that bullshit

01:27:43.612 --> 01:27:45.547
story about your
missing brother.

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:49.585
You didn't think that I actually
believe that crap, did you?

01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:52.088
You don't know me.

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:54.457
What I'm capable of.

01:27:55.492 --> 01:27:56.725
But you will.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.828
You're just another
fucking fanboy wannabe

01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:00.030
with mommy and daddy issues.

01:28:00.063 --> 01:28:01.364
You're a joke.

01:28:01.398 --> 01:28:03.532
You know, I think
I changed my mind.

01:28:03.565 --> 01:28:05.035
This gun will just do fine.

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:10.073
I'm glad I amuse you.

01:28:12.075 --> 01:28:12.909
It's funny.

01:28:14.411 --> 01:28:15.345
What's so funny?

01:28:17.213 --> 01:28:19.349
That you think that
gun's actually loaded.

01:29:02.658 --> 01:29:03.827
Take care. Max.

01:29:05.061 --> 01:29:07.729
Remember, try and enjoy it.

01:29:09.032 --> 01:29:10.533
It's all in the details.

01:29:31.588 --> 01:29:33.289
What a mess.

01:29:36.192 --> 01:29:39.395
I can't tell you how
disappointed I am.

01:29:39.429 --> 01:29:41.164
You showed such promise.

01:29:43.099 --> 01:29:43.933
Who are you?

01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:47.036
Now, Max.

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.206
I've been following
your career for years.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.208
Even thought about
you for the program.

01:29:53.309 --> 01:29:55.711
Bit you just haven't quite

01:29:55.744 --> 01:29:59.215
met my expectations
and you know,

01:29:59.249 --> 01:30:00.283
your time is up.

01:30:04.653 --> 01:30:05.687
What a waste?

01:30:12.762 --> 01:30:13.997
He's all yours.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.061
Beautiful.

01:31:26.336 --> 01:31:27.170
Laura?

01:31:36.179 --> 01:31:37.013
Shit.

01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:16.386
Gus?

01:32:26.896 --> 01:32:28.298
Hello?

01:32:28.331 --> 01:32:29.432
Hello?

01:32:29.465 --> 01:32:30.300
Can anybody hear me?

01:32:32.802 --> 01:32:33.970
This is a secure line.

01:32:34.003 --> 01:32:35.505
How did you access
this terminal?

01:32:35.538 --> 01:32:37.640
'Cause I'm trapped in your
fucking underground prison.

01:32:37.674 --> 01:32:38.841
Pleas, we need help.

01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:40.376
My friends are dying down here.

01:32:40.410 --> 01:32:41.311
That would
be the property

01:32:41.344 --> 01:32:42.712
of the US Defense Department.

01:32:42.745 --> 01:32:44.180
Trespassing is a
criminal offense.

01:32:44.213 --> 01:32:46.049
Fuck your trespass.

01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:47.283
If you want to arrest me,

01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:49.118
come down here and
fucking get me.

01:32:49.986 --> 01:32:51.254
Please stand by.

01:32:54.223 --> 01:32:56.626
Miss, what is your name?

01:32:56.659 --> 01:32:59.429
My name is Laura Dempsey.

01:32:59.462 --> 01:33:01.564
Laura, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

01:33:01.597 --> 01:33:02.965
I want you in any
of your colleagues

01:33:02.999 --> 01:33:04.734
to exit the building
immediately.

01:33:04.768 --> 01:33:05.968
Do you understand?

01:33:06.002 --> 01:33:08.371
We are locked in here.

01:33:08.404 --> 01:33:10.873
Do you not speak
fucking English?

01:33:10.907 --> 01:33:13.042
We need help please.

01:33:19.148 --> 01:33:19.982
Hello?

01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:22.151
Hello?

01:33:22.185 --> 01:33:22.985
Hello?

01:33:23.019 --> 01:33:23.953
Can you hear me?

01:33:23.986 --> 01:33:24.822
Hello?

01:33:25.756 --> 01:33:26.989
Shit.

01:33:27.023 --> 01:33:27.857
Hello?

01:34:08.664 --> 01:34:10.199
Oh shit.

01:34:10.233 --> 01:34:11.234
Who are you?

01:34:14.370 --> 01:34:15.204
Jen?

01:34:16.072 --> 01:34:16.906
Jen?

01:34:49.505 --> 01:34:50.940
Kill me, kill me!

01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:54.912
I'm standing here.

01:34:54.944 --> 01:34:56.179
I'm here, standing.

01:34:56.212 --> 01:34:58.381
Show yourself, motherfucker!

01:34:59.649 --> 01:35:02.051
You fucking piece of pigshit.

01:35:05.555 --> 01:35:07.123
I got nothing left.

01:35:09.158 --> 01:35:11.661
I'm hunting you, motherfucker.

01:35:13.496 --> 01:35:15.364
Big Bubba wants to say hi.

01:35:55.271 --> 01:35:57.173
Where the hell are you?

01:36:00.643 --> 01:36:01.444
Laura.

01:36:05.515 --> 01:36:06.817
Gus!

01:36:46.088 --> 01:36:47.189
Fuck.

01:37:05.008 --> 01:37:08.077
You wanna get close and make
this personal, motherfucker?

01:37:12.248 --> 01:37:13.850
You wanna go man on man?

01:37:14.952 --> 01:37:18.220
Or man against whatever
the fuck you are.

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:21.257
Bring it.

01:37:34.071 --> 01:37:35.471
Stay right there.

01:38:57.253 --> 01:38:58.554
Hey!

01:39:55.678 --> 01:39:58.048
Try coming back from
that, motherfucker.

01:40:11.393 --> 01:40:14.330
You know, you're
one crazy bitch.

01:40:16.032 --> 01:40:18.034
I had the whole
thing under control.

01:40:18.068 --> 01:40:19.735
Had him right
where I wanted him.

01:40:23.706 --> 01:40:24.540
So now what?

01:40:27.543 --> 01:40:28.410
Now we go home.

01:40:43.827 --> 01:40:44.761
Laura Dempsey?

01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:49.632
I'm the one you spoke to.

01:40:52.301 --> 01:40:53.402
Where are the others?

01:40:54.503 --> 01:40:55.304
They're dead.

01:40:57.339 --> 01:40:58.141
They're all dead.

01:41:00.277 --> 01:41:01.710
Are you sure?

01:41:04.413 --> 01:41:05.215
Yeah.

01:41:06.249 --> 01:41:07.050
I'm sure.

01:41:24.768 --> 01:41:25.936
What a mess.

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.617
Secure the asset and get
this place cleaned down.

01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:45.188
We're moving the entire
program to the Nevada compound.

01:41:53.196 --> 01:41:55.664
Hear that, baby,
we're going to Vegas.

01:41:55.698 --> 01:41:58.667
Mama needs a new pair of shoes.
