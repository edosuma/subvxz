<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.333 --> 00:05.959
<i>Stardate 43510.7:</i>

00:06.000 --> 00:08.125
<i>The</i> Enterprise

00:06.000 --> 00:08.125
<i>has put in at Rutia IV</i>

00:08.166 --> 00:09.709
<i>to deliver medical supplies</i>

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
<i>following an outbreak</i>

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
<i>of violent protests.</i>

00:12.041 --> 00:14.667
<i>Although non-aligned,</i>

00:12.041 --> 00:14.667
<i>the planet has enjoyed</i>

00:14.709 --> 00:17.500
<i>a long trading relationship</i>

00:14.709 --> 00:17.500
<i>with the Federation.</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:19.750
<i>Now, a generation of peace</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:19.750
<i>has ended</i>

00:19.792 --> 00:23.000
<i>with terrorist attacks</i>

00:19.792 --> 00:23.000
<i>by Ansata separatists</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:25.834
<i>who are demanding autonomy</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:25.834
<i>and self-determination</i>

00:25.875 --> 00:28.083
<i>for their homeland</i>

00:25.875 --> 00:28.083
<i>on the western continent.</i>

00:28.125 --> 00:30.166
<i>Recreational shore leave</i>

00:28.125 --> 00:30.166
<i>has been prohibited</i>

00:30.208 --> 00:34.208
<i>and all away teams have been</i>

00:30.208 --> 00:34.208
<i>instructed to beam down armed.</i>

00:35.792 --> 00:38.333
We have only a few minutes

00:35.792 --> 00:38.333
before our next meeting, Doctor.

00:38.375 --> 00:40.208
It's all right,

00:38.375 --> 00:40.208
we're finished.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.208
Waiter.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.375
(<i> explosion</i> )

00:43.417 --> 00:45.000
(<i> people screaming</i> )

00:45.041 --> 00:47.750
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

00:49.125 --> 00:50.291
Doctor!

00:50.333 --> 00:51.667
SECURITY:

00:50.333 --> 00:51.667
Keep back.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.417
CRUSHER:

00:51.709 --> 00:53.417
Put that away.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.417
I'm a doctor.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.083
Just lie still.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.083
Try not to move.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.750
Lieutenant Worf, I need

01:00.125 --> 01:02.750
some bandages, disinfectant--

01:02.792 --> 01:04.417
something with

01:02.792 --> 01:04.417
alcohol in it.

01:04.458 --> 01:05.709
Doctor, it is not safe.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.208
That's an order, Lieutenant.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.583
(<i> alarm stops</i> )

01:12.625 --> 01:14.041
SECURITY:

01:12.625 --> 01:14.041
You there,

01:12.625 --> 01:14.041
clear this area.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.959
Don't be afraid.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.083
There's a lot of bleeding,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.083
but it's not as bad as it looks.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.250
The Klingon's right.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.417
These Ansata,

01:19.291 --> 01:21.417
they're madmen.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.917
There could be

01:21.458 --> 01:23.917
another bomb.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.041
(<i> coughs</i> )

01:26.083 --> 01:27.834
Clear this area.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.834
Everyone out...

01:27.875 --> 01:29.667
Doctor, I believe

01:27.875 --> 01:29.667
it would be prudent

01:29.709 --> 01:31.333
to return

01:29.709 --> 01:31.333
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

01:31.375 --> 01:33.291
There are physicians

01:31.375 --> 01:33.291
on this planet.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.917
Who are not here.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.917
I am.

01:34.959 --> 01:37.041
SECURITY:

01:34.959 --> 01:37.041
Everyone out.

01:34.959 --> 01:37.041
This way.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.166
Doctor.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.417
Thank you.

01:46.041 --> 01:47.250
Thank you.

01:47.291 --> 01:48.875
Not at all, Doctor.

01:52.875 --> 01:54.792
Captain,

01:52.875 --> 01:54.792
there has been an incident.

01:54.834 --> 01:58.083
A bomb has been detonated

01:54.834 --> 01:58.083
by Ansata terrorists.

01:58.125 --> 02:01.333
Your security status?

01:58.125 --> 02:01.333
Vulnerable, sir.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.583
Transporter Room 3,

02:01.375 --> 02:03.583
lock onto the away team.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.542
Prepare to beam them back.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.542
CREWMAN: Yes, Captain.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.250
Sir, I've recommended

02:05.583 --> 02:07.250
such a course,

02:07.291 --> 02:08.875
but there are several wounded

02:07.291 --> 02:08.875
and Dr. Crusher

02:08.917 --> 02:11.125
is insisting on attending to...

02:08.917 --> 02:11.125
I understand.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.500
Picard to Dr. Crusher.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.500
Go ahead.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.250
Doctor, Commander Data has

02:13.542 --> 02:16.250
informed me of your situation.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.166
I already know

02:16.291 --> 02:18.166
what you're going to say.

02:18.208 --> 02:20.333
Doctor, will you

02:18.208 --> 02:20.333
at least allow...

02:20.375 --> 02:22.542
The longer we argue, the longer

02:20.375 --> 02:22.542
it's going to take me to save...

02:22.583 --> 02:24.583
Doctor, you are endangering

02:22.583 --> 02:24.583
yourself and the away team.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.125
Captain, I am trying to put life

02:24.625 --> 02:27.125
back into a wounded body

02:27.166 --> 02:28.667
with sleight of hand,

02:27.166 --> 02:28.667
I'm not going anywhere.

02:28.709 --> 02:30.917
Data and Worf

02:28.709 --> 02:30.917
don't have to stay.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.917
Crusher out.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.834
Transporter Room, do you have

02:33.959 --> 02:35.834
a lock on the away team?

02:35.875 --> 02:38.375
CREWMAN:

02:35.875 --> 02:38.375
Aye, sir. Shall

02:35.875 --> 02:38.375
I transport them?

02:40.333 --> 02:44.125
I don't want to be in the

02:40.333 --> 02:44.125
transporter room to greet her.

02:44.166 --> 02:45.750
Commander Data,

02:45.792 --> 02:48.041
hold your position until the

02:45.792 --> 02:48.041
Rutian medics arrive.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.750
Aye, sir.

02:52.709 --> 02:56.375
The tricorder is not reading

02:52.709 --> 02:56.375
any other explosive devices

02:56.417 --> 02:58.208
in this vicinity.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.583
SECURITY:

03:03.625 --> 03:05.583
Get out of the way!

03:03.625 --> 03:05.583
Move!

03:05.625 --> 03:07.000
What...

03:09.000 --> 03:10.709
(<i> yells</i> )

03:10.750 --> 03:12.792
You don't understand,

03:10.750 --> 03:12.792
I'm a...

03:48.166 --> 03:52.542
PICARD:

03:48.166 --> 03:52.542
<i>Space... the final frontier.</i>

03:52.583 --> 03:56.750
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:52.583 --> 03:56.750
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.417
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:58.458 --> 04:02.458
<i>to explore</i>

03:58.458 --> 04:02.458
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

04:02.500 --> 04:06.834
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:02.500 --> 04:06.834
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

04:06.875 --> 04:11.750
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:06.875 --> 04:11.750
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:16.291 --> 05:19.583
A transporter would leave

05:16.291 --> 05:19.583
residual ionization in the air.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.875
Our tricorder readings found

05:19.625 --> 05:22.875
no trace after the incident.

05:22.917 --> 05:25.041
People don't just appear

05:22.917 --> 05:25.041
and disappear.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.875
There must be some way

05:25.083 --> 05:26.875
to track her.

05:26.917 --> 05:29.875
We have been unable to detect

05:26.917 --> 05:29.875
a signal from her communicator.

05:29.917 --> 05:31.625
Either it has been deactivated

05:31.667 --> 05:34.625
or she is being held

05:31.667 --> 05:34.625
in a shielded location.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.875
Why her?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.667
WORF:

05:35.917 --> 05:37.667
Sir, I believe

05:37.709 --> 05:40.000
she was the intended target

05:37.709 --> 05:40.000
of the abduction.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.625
Why would they want to take

05:40.041 --> 05:42.625
a Federation hostage?

05:42.667 --> 05:43.917
Their fight doesn't involve us.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.709
It does now.

05:57.709 --> 06:01.333
You hungry?

05:57.709 --> 06:01.333
You want something to eat?

06:03.667 --> 06:06.041
Doesn't matter to me.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.792
You want to be hungry,

06:06.083 --> 06:07.792
be hungry.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.125
What's your name?

06:17.041 --> 06:21.291
You're a doctor

06:17.041 --> 06:21.291
on a Federation starship.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.417
I always wondered

06:23.834 --> 06:25.417
what it would be like

06:25.458 --> 06:28.375
to travel across the galaxy.

06:28.417 --> 06:32.250
It's not something

06:28.417 --> 06:32.250
I've exactly had time for.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.125
This isn't the best way

06:35.875 --> 06:39.125
to meet new people, is it?

06:50.500 --> 06:54.125
If you need anything,

06:50.500 --> 06:54.125
ask for me.

06:54.166 --> 06:56.917
My name is Kyril Finn.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.125
They know me.

07:07.583 --> 07:11.000
We have no reason to believe

07:07.583 --> 07:11.000
she's been hurt in any way.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.792
In fact, it's more than likely

07:11.041 --> 07:13.792
they will take good care of her

07:13.834 --> 07:16.041
if they want to use her

07:13.834 --> 07:16.041
as a bargaining chip.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.667
Bargaining chip?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.792
The innocent often

07:17.709 --> 07:19.792
become pawns

07:19.834 --> 07:22.166
in conflicts of

07:19.834 --> 07:22.166
this type, Wes.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.375
You see, the Ansata

07:22.208 --> 07:24.375
separatists

07:24.417 --> 07:26.917
have been trying for generations

07:24.417 --> 07:26.917
to free themselves

07:26.959 --> 07:28.875
from the rule

07:26.959 --> 07:28.875
of the eastern continent.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.250
And if they can get

07:28.917 --> 07:30.250
the government

07:30.291 --> 07:32.542
just to acknowledges

07:30.291 --> 07:32.542
their demands,

07:32.583 --> 07:35.542
then kidnapping your mother

07:32.583 --> 07:35.542
will have served its purpose.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.542
I think, that's

07:35.583 --> 07:37.542
what they may be after,

07:37.583 --> 07:39.083
but it may not.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.709
Frankly, Wesley,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.709
I don't care.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.750
My only concern

07:40.750 --> 07:42.750
is to get your mother back.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.458
And very shortly,

07:42.792 --> 07:44.458
we shall be leaving

07:44.500 --> 07:46.417
to have a meeting

07:44.500 --> 07:46.417
with the authorities.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.583
Request permission to be

07:46.458 --> 07:48.583
on the away team, sir.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.208
No. You have an important job

07:48.625 --> 07:51.208
to do here.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.000
If we are to free your mother,

07:53.041 --> 07:55.792
then we have to be able to trace

07:53.041 --> 07:55.792
the movements of the terrorists.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.041
I want you to work with

07:55.834 --> 07:58.041
the team that are investigating

07:58.083 --> 08:00.125
this new technology of theirs.

08:00.166 --> 08:03.125
(<i> sighs</i> )

08:00.166 --> 08:03.125
I understand.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.917
Report to Mr. Data.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.959
Dismissed.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.083
He needs your

08:15.750 --> 08:18.083
strength right now.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.333
History has shown us

08:21.375 --> 08:25.208
that strength may be useless

08:21.375 --> 08:25.208
when faced with terrorism.

08:35.291 --> 08:38.125
And what exactly

08:35.291 --> 08:38.125
is Ansata policy

08:38.166 --> 08:39.792
with regard to hostages?

08:39.834 --> 08:42.709
I doubt if they have one.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.542
They don't usually

08:42.750 --> 08:45.542
take hostages.

08:45.583 --> 08:48.208
These are not people

08:45.583 --> 08:48.208
we're dealing with here.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.667
They're animals.

08:49.709 --> 08:52.959
Fanatics who kill

08:49.709 --> 08:52.959
without remorse or conscience,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.166
who think nothing

08:53.000 --> 08:56.166
of murdering innocent people.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.375
But they could just as easily

08:56.208 --> 08:59.375
have shot her where she stood.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.166
Don't ask me

08:59.417 --> 09:01.166
to explain them.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.500
I can't.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.709
The atrocities

09:02.542 --> 09:04.709
that I've seen...

09:06.125 --> 09:08.250
And now they have

09:06.125 --> 09:08.250
this new device

09:08.291 --> 09:10.083
that makes them

09:08.291 --> 09:10.083
even more deadly.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.000
How do I combat an enemy

09:12.041 --> 09:13.959
that fails to register

09:12.041 --> 09:13.959
on any scanner

09:14.000 --> 09:15.709
until they're literally

09:14.000 --> 09:15.709
standing in front of you

09:15.750 --> 09:17.959
pointing a phaser

09:15.750 --> 09:17.959
at your head?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.083
What can you tell us

09:18.000 --> 09:20.083
about this device?

09:20.125 --> 09:21.750
Not much really.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.709
They first started

09:21.792 --> 09:23.709
using it two months ago.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.166
We've taken several of these

09:23.750 --> 09:26.166
off dead terrorists.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.750
Our people have

09:26.208 --> 09:27.750
looked at them.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.208
Nothing they

09:27.792 --> 09:29.208
can explain.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.917
Do you mind if we take

09:29.250 --> 09:30.917
one of these with us

09:30.959 --> 09:32.417
and have our people

09:30.959 --> 09:32.417
study it?

09:32.458 --> 09:34.166
Not at all.

09:34.208 --> 09:37.166
And I'll put you in touch with

09:34.208 --> 09:37.166
our research people if you wish.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.291
I appreciate your help.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.667
Perhaps if we found

09:39.333 --> 09:42.667
ourselves in possession

09:42.709 --> 09:45.500
of some of that advanced

09:42.709 --> 09:45.500
Federation weaponry of yours,

09:45.542 --> 09:49.000
it would shift the balance

09:45.542 --> 09:49.000
of power back to our favor.

09:49.041 --> 09:52.083
Of course, you know

09:49.041 --> 09:52.083
that is out of the question.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.959
Yes, of course.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.166
I would like to leave

09:54.000 --> 09:56.166
Commander Riker here

09:56.208 --> 09:58.333
to assist in your search

09:56.208 --> 09:58.333
for Dr. Crusher.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.792
If you like.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.959
You don't sound

10:00.834 --> 10:02.959
very optimistic.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.166
I know my enemy, Commander.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.625
They don't leave much room

10:05.208 --> 10:07.625
for optimism.

10:16.834 --> 10:20.375
You hungry?

10:16.834 --> 10:20.375
You want something to eat?

10:30.750 --> 10:32.792
Relax, relax.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.041
I'm just going to...

10:50.000 --> 10:52.125
Now, eat something.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.458
What's the point

10:52.166 --> 10:54.458
of not eating?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.709
You're the only one

10:54.500 --> 10:56.709
who suffers.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.792
Do I look like

10:56.750 --> 10:58.792
it's bothering me?

11:00.875 --> 11:04.583
Okay, it's bothering me.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.166
Come on.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.875
No forks, sorry.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.250
Did I mention my name is Finn?

11:18.291 --> 11:19.625
And you're...

11:19.667 --> 11:22.083
Why have you brought me here?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.709
I need a doctor.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.792
There are doctors on Rutia.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.250
I need somebody better.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.875
I heard you were

11:27.291 --> 11:29.875
with the Federation flagship

11:29.917 --> 11:31.542
and I knew you had to be.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.250
Who told you that?

11:33.291 --> 11:34.667
I heard.

11:34.709 --> 11:38.125
Now you'll help me

11:34.709 --> 11:38.125
just like you helped them.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.250
What are you talking about?

11:45.583 --> 11:49.291
Your ship carries

11:45.583 --> 11:49.291
medical supplies for them--

11:49.333 --> 11:50.792
for the other side.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.500
Why does the Federation

11:50.834 --> 11:53.500
ally itself with the Rutians?

11:53.542 --> 11:55.291
We don't.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.875
All we did was bring--

11:55.333 --> 11:57.875
Medical supplies.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.500
People were hurt.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.500
I know.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.208
I hurt them.

12:03.834 --> 12:07.125
You're finished eating.

12:03.834 --> 12:07.125
Get up.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.208
Get up.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.041
I have a son.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.834
You'll be with him

12:25.583 --> 12:28.834
again, Doctor.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.542
I see no reason to kill you.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.458
(<i> moaning</i> )

13:01.208 --> 13:03.125
I need some instruments

13:01.208 --> 13:03.125
from my ship

13:03.166 --> 13:04.792
in order to diagnose this.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.500
And you think if I allow

13:04.834 --> 13:06.500
you to contact your ship

13:06.542 --> 13:08.291
they will transport

13:06.542 --> 13:08.291
the instruments?

13:08.333 --> 13:10.375
When I inform the Captain

13:08.333 --> 13:10.375
how serious the situation is,

13:10.417 --> 13:12.291
I'm sure he'll agree.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
I've told you, Finn,

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
the Federation is not allied

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
with the Rutians.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.041
We're here

13:15.333 --> 13:17.041
on an errand of mercy.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.625
And since the Federation

13:17.083 --> 13:19.625
does not wish to take sides,

13:19.667 --> 13:22.417
they will send

13:19.667 --> 13:22.417
the supplies that you need.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.417
Absolutely.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.792
I've anticipated

13:30.125 --> 13:32.792
your needs.

13:34.375 --> 13:36.709
These are Federation supplies.

13:36.750 --> 13:40.166
The ones we had delivered

13:36.750 --> 13:40.166
to the medical dispensary.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.125
I heard.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.500
You mean to tell me all these

13:46.000 --> 13:48.500
people belong to the Ansata?

13:48.542 --> 13:49.834
No, not really.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.583
We suspect

13:49.875 --> 13:51.583
the organization itself

13:51.625 --> 13:54.166
only to consist

13:51.625 --> 13:54.166
of some 200 members.

13:54.208 --> 13:58.041
There are over 5,000

13:54.208 --> 13:58.041
names on this list.

13:58.083 --> 14:01.959
Citizens we know to be

13:58.083 --> 14:01.959
sympathetic to their cause.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.125
They pass along weaponry

14:02.000 --> 14:05.125
and information

14:05.166 --> 14:07.583
march in pro-Ansata

14:05.166 --> 14:07.583
demonstrations

14:07.625 --> 14:09.333
participate in

14:07.625 --> 14:09.333
general strikes

14:09.375 --> 14:11.000
or the occasional riot.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.750
How did this ever

14:11.041 --> 14:12.750
get started?

14:14.250 --> 14:16.917
70 years ago,

14:14.250 --> 14:16.917
we denied them independence.

14:16.959 --> 14:20.375
That gave them

14:16.959 --> 14:20.375
a noble cause.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.417
Now it's just an excuse

14:20.417 --> 14:23.417
for more violence.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.709
You hate them as much

14:23.458 --> 14:26.709
as they hate you.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.834
Believe it or not,

14:29.875 --> 14:32.125
I always considered

14:29.875 --> 14:32.125
myself moderate.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.417
What changed your mind?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.709
Being stationed here

14:34.458 --> 14:36.709
for six months

14:36.750 --> 14:39.166
watching the body count grow.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.458
The three assassination

14:39.208 --> 14:41.458
attempts on my life.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.375
Well, that'll change

14:41.500 --> 14:44.375
your point of view.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.458
The event that really

14:44.417 --> 14:46.458
opened my eyes

14:46.500 --> 14:49.834
took place only a few

14:46.500 --> 14:49.834
days after my arrival.

14:49.875 --> 14:53.125
A terrorist bomb

14:49.875 --> 14:53.125
destroyed a shuttlebus.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.208
60 schoolchildren.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.667
There were no survivors.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.458
The Ansata claimed

15:02.166 --> 15:05.458
that it was a mistake--

15:05.500 --> 15:09.417
that their intended target

15:05.500 --> 15:09.417
was a police transport.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.417
As if that made

15:11.000 --> 15:13.417
everything all right.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.333
That day, I vowed

15:17.500 --> 15:20.333
that I would put an end

15:20.375 --> 15:22.542
to terrorism in this city...

15:22.583 --> 15:24.709
and I will.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.458
Thank you.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.834
You're very helpful.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.709
You could learn to do this

15:33.875 --> 15:36.709
when you grow up.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.333
<i>If</i> you grow up.

15:48.959 --> 15:51.333
They're dying.

15:51.375 --> 15:54.041
I'm seeing a complicated

15:51.375 --> 15:54.041
set of conditions.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.458
Their DNA is warped somehow

15:56.500 --> 15:59.417
and it's distorting their

15:56.500 --> 15:59.417
entire cellular chemistry.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.834
You can't do anything?

16:02.875 --> 16:06.125
I can make them more

16:02.875 --> 16:06.125
comfortable, that's all.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.750
The damage is too extensive.

16:12.917 --> 16:15.959
(<i> inaudible</i> )

16:17.625 --> 16:21.125
If I could detect their

16:17.625 --> 16:21.125
condition earlier...

16:21.166 --> 16:23.625
You could reverse

16:21.166 --> 16:23.625
the damage?

16:23.667 --> 16:26.083
Perhaps.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.083
I don't know.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.917
What happened

16:26.125 --> 16:28.917
to them?

16:28.959 --> 16:31.583
It's the inverter.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.458
It's given our cause a new life

16:34.500 --> 16:38.959
but... it asks

16:34.500 --> 16:38.959
for our lives in return.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.041
What does it do?

16:42.875 --> 16:45.542
We transport through

16:42.875 --> 16:45.542
a dimensional shift

16:45.583 --> 16:48.125
that the Rutian

16:45.583 --> 16:48.125
sensors can't trace.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.250
Dimensional shifting?

16:50.291 --> 16:52.583
You can't do that

16:50.291 --> 16:52.583
with humanoid tissue.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.792
There are risks,

16:52.625 --> 16:54.792
the designers told us,

16:54.834 --> 16:57.458
but... it works.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.583
You're showing the same

16:57.500 --> 17:00.583
distorted readings.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.750
Not as severe

17:00.625 --> 17:02.750
as the others, but...

17:02.792 --> 17:04.583
Doesn't matter.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.333
It does if it kills you.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.875
Don't you know?

17:09.917 --> 17:14.208
A dead martyr is worth

17:09.917 --> 17:14.208
10 posturing leaders.

17:22.417 --> 17:26.375
A subspace field coil with

17:22.417 --> 17:26.375
an isolated power source.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.375
Curious.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.792
Hey, guys,

17:28.417 --> 17:30.792
come here.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.250
Look at this.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.834
The Rutian team picked up

17:35.291 --> 17:38.834
a faint nuclear vibration

17:38.875 --> 17:40.417
during the terrorist movements.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.000
Nuclear vibration?

17:42.041 --> 17:43.417
That could

17:42.041 --> 17:43.417
possibly indicate

17:43.458 --> 17:46.542
subspace transition rebound

17:43.458 --> 17:46.542
during transport.

17:46.583 --> 17:47.834
Wait a minute,

17:46.583 --> 17:47.834
wait a minute.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.834
May I?

17:47.875 --> 17:49.834
Mm-hmm.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.125
Computer, call up

17:49.875 --> 17:52.125
the files on...

17:52.166 --> 17:53.750
Oh, what was his name?

17:53.792 --> 17:56.041
We spent two hours on him

17:53.792 --> 17:56.041
in astral physics last year.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.917
Uh... folded-space transport.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.500
Adaptive transport?

17:57.959 --> 18:00.500
Yes.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.208
Are you referring

18:00.542 --> 18:02.208
to the Elway theorem?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.875
Yes. Computer, call up

18:02.250 --> 18:04.875
the files on the Elway theorem.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.000
What if they're using

18:04.917 --> 18:07.000
inter-dimensional travel?

18:07.041 --> 18:10.000
But the Elway theorem proved

18:07.041 --> 18:10.000
to be entirely inaccurate.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.792
All research was abandoned

18:10.041 --> 18:12.792
by the mid-23rd century.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.208
But, Data, look-- the nuclear

18:12.834 --> 18:15.208
vibrations are the same

18:15.250 --> 18:17.125
and Elway used a model

18:15.250 --> 18:17.125
similar to this.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.834
It would certainly

18:17.166 --> 18:18.834
be untraceable

18:18.875 --> 18:20.375
by any standard method

18:18.875 --> 18:20.375
of detection.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.083
But it was proven

18:20.417 --> 18:22.083
to be fatal.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.792
To use this technology

18:22.125 --> 18:24.792
would be an irrational act.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.041
We may be dealing with

18:24.834 --> 18:27.041
irrational people, Data.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.750
Is there a way

18:27.083 --> 18:28.750
to trace this?

18:28.792 --> 18:31.417
With an adaptive

18:28.792 --> 18:31.417
subspace echogram, maybe.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.875
Captain, anyone who is willing

18:31.458 --> 18:34.875
to transport in this manner

18:34.917 --> 18:36.750
would suffer significant

18:34.917 --> 18:36.750
internal damage

18:36.792 --> 18:38.208
that could be detected.

18:38.250 --> 18:41.166
Hmm. It sounds as though

18:38.250 --> 18:41.166
they may require

18:41.208 --> 18:44.875
the services...

18:41.208 --> 18:44.875
of a doctor.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.083
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

18:55.083 --> 18:56.417
Excuse me.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.917
(<i> indistinct</i>

18:56.458 --> 18:59.917
<i>radio transmission</i> )

19:04.959 --> 19:06.667
This is no way to live.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.250
For us or them?

19:08.291 --> 19:09.500
For both of you.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.834
I know it's

19:09.542 --> 19:11.834
not pretty, Riker,

19:11.875 --> 19:14.208
but this is what terrorism

19:11.875 --> 19:14.208
has done to this city.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.667
There's got to be a better way

19:14.250 --> 19:16.667
to deal with it than this.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.458
My methods may seem harsh

19:16.709 --> 19:19.458
but, believe me,

19:19.500 --> 19:21.959
they're gentle compared

19:19.500 --> 19:21.959
to my predecessors.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.917
Suspects would be brought

19:22.000 --> 19:24.917
into police headquarters

19:24.959 --> 19:27.291
and mysteriously vanish.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.750
I put a stop to that.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.000
What happened

19:29.792 --> 19:32.000
to your predecessors?

19:32.041 --> 19:34.083
They were murdered.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.583
Are you going to tell me that

19:35.792 --> 19:38.583
little boy's a threat?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.875
It's possible.

19:40.917 --> 19:44.041
That shuttlebus

19:40.917 --> 19:44.041
I told you about?

19:44.083 --> 19:47.000
The bomb was set

19:44.083 --> 19:47.000
by a teenager.

19:47.041 --> 19:50.917
In a world where children

19:47.041 --> 19:50.917
blow up children,

19:50.959 --> 19:53.083
everyone's a threat.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.834
It's okay.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.834
Over there.

20:17.542 --> 20:20.291
You should be drawing,

20:17.542 --> 20:20.291
not killing people.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.208
I can do both.

20:23.250 --> 20:27.542
How can you have such a casual

20:23.250 --> 20:27.542
attitude toward killing?

20:27.583 --> 20:31.417
I take my killing

20:27.583 --> 20:31.417
very seriously, Doctor.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.041
You are an idealist.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.625
I live in an ideal culture.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.000
There's no need for

20:36.667 --> 20:39.000
your kind of violence.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.709
We've proven that.

20:40.750 --> 20:43.083
Your origins on Earth

20:43.125 --> 20:45.709
are from the American

20:43.125 --> 20:45.709
continent, are they not?

20:45.750 --> 20:46.959
North America.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.208
Yes, I've read

20:47.000 --> 20:49.208
your history books.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.500
This is a war

20:49.250 --> 20:51.500
for independence

20:51.542 --> 20:54.917
and I am no different than your

20:51.542 --> 20:54.917
own George Washington.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.959
Washington was a military

20:57.250 --> 21:00.959
general, not a terrorist.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.709
The difference between

21:01.000 --> 21:04.709
generals and terrorists, Doctor,

21:04.750 --> 21:06.834
is only the difference

21:04.750 --> 21:06.834
between winners and losers.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.667
You win, you're called

21:06.875 --> 21:09.667
a general, you lose...

21:09.709 --> 21:12.542
You are killing

21:09.709 --> 21:12.542
innocent people.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.125
Can't you see the immorality

21:12.583 --> 21:15.125
of what you're doing?

21:15.166 --> 21:18.834
Or have you killed so much

21:15.166 --> 21:18.834
you've become blind to it?

21:18.875 --> 21:20.917
How much innocent blood

21:18.875 --> 21:20.917
has been spilled

21:20.959 --> 21:22.583
for the cause of freedom

21:22.625 --> 21:24.709
in the history

21:22.625 --> 21:24.709
of your Federation, Doctor?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.667
How many good

21:24.750 --> 21:26.667
and noble societies

21:26.709 --> 21:30.458
have bombed civilians in war,

21:26.709 --> 21:30.458
have wiped out whole cities?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.375
And now that you enjoy

21:30.500 --> 21:32.375
the comfort that has come

21:32.417 --> 21:34.291
from their battles,

21:32.417 --> 21:34.291
their killing,

21:34.333 --> 21:37.625
you frown on

21:34.333 --> 21:37.625
my immorality?

21:37.667 --> 21:41.709
I am willing to die

21:37.667 --> 21:41.709
for my freedom, Doctor.

21:41.750 --> 21:45.875
And in the finest tradition

21:41.750 --> 21:45.875
of your own great civilization,

21:45.917 --> 21:49.375
I'm willing to

21:45.917 --> 21:49.375
kill for it, too.

21:54.709 --> 21:56.667
All right,

21:54.709 --> 21:56.667
you can go.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.583
SECURITY:

22:03.125 --> 22:04.583
Next man.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.625
If you want, I could

22:04.625 --> 22:06.625
become more persuasive.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.208
No.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.208
You're Katik Shaw,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.208
the waiter from the Lumar Cafe.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.041
You witnessed both the explosion

22:17.250 --> 22:20.041
and the kidnapping.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.041
I saw nothing.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.375
We're aware of your ties

22:22.083 --> 22:24.375
with the Ansata.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.417
For all we know,

22:24.417 --> 22:26.417
you planted the bomb yourself.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.208
Where have they

22:26.458 --> 22:28.208
taken her?

22:28.250 --> 22:29.917
I don't know

22:28.250 --> 22:29.917
what you're talking about.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.417
I've had enough of this.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.125
I want you to take a message

22:31.458 --> 22:33.125
back to your people.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.834
You tell them the Federation

22:33.166 --> 22:35.834
is willing to negotiate

22:35.875 --> 22:37.458
for the release of

22:35.875 --> 22:37.458
Dr. Crusher.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.166
Riker!

22:39.208 --> 22:42.458
She's a Starfleet officer

22:39.208 --> 22:42.458
and she's my responsibility.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.667
If your people have terms,

22:42.500 --> 22:45.667
we're willing to listen.

22:45.709 --> 22:49.750
We want her back.

22:45.709 --> 22:49.750
It's as simple as that.

22:49.792 --> 22:53.583
I don't think it's necessary

22:49.792 --> 22:53.583
to detain this gentleman

22:49.792 --> 22:53.583
any longer.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.875
Get out.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.750
I should have

23:04.625 --> 23:06.750
him followed,

23:06.792 --> 23:09.417
but we'll try it your way.

23:09.458 --> 23:10.792
Is that what you want?

23:10.834 --> 23:13.834
What I want...

23:13.875 --> 23:15.917
is to go home.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.125
Back to my own country.

23:18.166 --> 23:21.208
To leave behind the roundups,

23:18.166 --> 23:21.208
the interrogations,

23:21.250 --> 23:23.417
the bodies

23:21.250 --> 23:23.417
lying in the street.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.375
To be able to walk

23:23.458 --> 23:25.375
without the bodyguards.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.834
And not to have to jump

23:25.417 --> 23:27.834
at every unexpected noise.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.041
<i>That's</i> what I want, Riker.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.792
A dimensional jump

23:39.917 --> 23:41.792
can create

23:41.834 --> 23:44.500
subspace pressure

23:41.834 --> 23:44.500
modulation, Captain.

23:44.542 --> 23:46.583
By setting up

23:44.542 --> 23:46.583
a magnetosphere echogram

23:46.625 --> 23:48.375
that can monitor each

23:46.625 --> 23:48.375
of their movements,

23:48.417 --> 23:50.000
we may be able to

23:48.417 --> 23:50.000
collect enough data

23:50.041 --> 23:51.625
to trace their

23:50.041 --> 23:51.625
power source.

23:51.667 --> 23:54.500
Can you estimate the number

23:51.667 --> 23:54.500
of jumps it would take?

23:54.542 --> 23:57.291
Dimensional shifting is such

23:54.542 --> 23:57.291
an unstable procedure, sir,

23:57.333 --> 24:01.166
that I cannot say.

24:01.208 --> 24:04.166
Sir, I am finding it

24:01.208 --> 24:04.166
difficult

24:04.208 --> 24:07.250
to understand many aspects

24:04.208 --> 24:07.250
of Ansata conduct.

24:07.291 --> 24:10.208
Much of their behavioral norm

24:07.291 --> 24:10.208
would be defined by my program

24:10.250 --> 24:12.458
as unnecessary

24:10.250 --> 24:12.458
and unacceptable.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.583
Mm-hmm. By my "program,"

24:12.500 --> 24:15.583
as well, Data.

24:15.625 --> 24:17.625
But if that

24:15.625 --> 24:17.625
is so, Captain,

24:17.667 --> 24:20.542
why are their methods

24:17.667 --> 24:20.542
so often successful?

24:20.583 --> 24:23.417
I have been reviewing the

24:20.583 --> 24:23.417
history of armed rebellion.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.083
And it appears

24:23.458 --> 24:25.083
that terrorism

24:25.125 --> 24:28.166
is an effective way to

24:25.125 --> 24:28.166
promote political change.

24:28.208 --> 24:32.083
Yes, it can be, but I have

24:28.208 --> 24:32.083
never subscribed to the theory

24:32.125 --> 24:35.125
that political power flows

24:32.125 --> 24:35.125
from the barrel of a gun.

24:35.166 --> 24:37.333
Yet, there are

24:35.166 --> 24:37.333
numerous examples

24:37.375 --> 24:39.250
when it was successful.

24:39.291 --> 24:42.083
The independence of the

24:39.291 --> 24:42.083
Mexican State from Spain,

24:42.125 --> 24:44.583
the Irish Unification

24:42.125 --> 24:44.583
of 2024,

24:44.625 --> 24:45.875
and the Kenzie Rebellion.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.583
Yes, I'm aware of them.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.208
Then would it be

24:47.625 --> 24:49.208
accurate to say

24:49.250 --> 24:51.792
that terrorism<i> is</i> acceptable

24:49.250 --> 24:51.792
when all options

24:51.834 --> 24:54.542
for peaceful settlement

24:51.834 --> 24:54.542
have been foreclosed?

24:54.583 --> 24:56.125
(<i> sighs</i> )

24:56.166 --> 24:58.333
Data, these are questions

24:56.166 --> 24:58.333
that mankind

24:58.375 --> 25:00.458
has been struggling with

24:58.375 --> 25:00.458
throughout history.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.750
Your confusion is...

25:02.792 --> 25:05.709
only human.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.291
Finn, everyone

25:12.500 --> 25:15.291
is being rounded up.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.625
Because of her?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.834
The Federation wants

25:16.667 --> 25:18.834
to negotiate a release.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.625
While they arrange

25:18.875 --> 25:20.625
for the Rutian police

25:20.667 --> 25:22.834
to fill up

25:20.667 --> 25:22.834
the detention cells.

25:22.875 --> 25:25.417
A Starfleet officer

25:22.875 --> 25:25.417
is working with the director.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.041
He wants a meeting with you.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.625
Oh, I'm sure he does.

25:31.166 --> 25:35.166
Your Federation colleagues

25:31.166 --> 25:35.166
have engineered mass arrests

25:35.208 --> 25:37.667
to pressure me

25:35.208 --> 25:37.667
into releasing you.

25:37.709 --> 25:39.417
I'm sure you've

25:37.709 --> 25:39.417
misunderstood.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.542
They're working with the police.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.542
He's seen it with his own eyes.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.083
All they want

25:41.583 --> 25:44.083
is to get me back safely.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.542
I'm not releasing you.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.709
I need you here.

25:48.750 --> 25:51.208
To find a way to

25:48.750 --> 25:51.208
reverse the effects

25:51.250 --> 25:53.458
of the dimensional shift?

25:53.500 --> 25:55.542
I can do that right now.

25:55.583 --> 25:57.041
Stop using it.

26:01.250 --> 26:04.333
I have a life, Finn.

26:01.250 --> 26:04.333
I have a son who needs me.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.417
Is your son

26:05.458 --> 26:07.417
on the ship?

26:05.458 --> 26:07.417
Yes.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.083
(<i> sighs</i> )

26:09.125 --> 26:11.041
I'm sorry

26:09.125 --> 26:11.041
he's on the ship.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.750
No.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.208
They have joined forces

26:12.792 --> 26:15.208
with the Rutians against us.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.583
We are not your enemy.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.917
They are more valuable

26:16.625 --> 26:18.917
to me than an enemy.

26:18.959 --> 26:22.125
For 70 years, we have shouted

26:18.959 --> 26:22.125
and no one has heard us.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.041
Destroy the Federation flagship,

26:22.166 --> 26:25.041
someone will listen.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.375
Please...

26:25.083 --> 26:27.375
<i>They</i> are the ones

26:25.083 --> 26:27.375
who interfered.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.166
They are the ones who

26:27.417 --> 26:29.166
sent medical supplies.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.959
They are the ones who

26:29.208 --> 26:30.959
organized mass arrests.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.333
<i>They</i> are killing

26:31.000 --> 26:33.333
your son, not me.

26:35.208 --> 26:39.166
Please, Finn, don't do this.

26:39.208 --> 26:42.542
I will do anything you ask.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.166
I had a son, too.

26:48.875 --> 26:52.500
He was 13 when he died

26:48.875 --> 26:52.500
in detention.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.875
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

27:10.667 --> 27:12.083
What?

27:13.083 --> 27:14.959
(<i> screams</i> )

27:17.250 --> 27:20.041
(<i> console beeps</i> )

27:17.250 --> 27:20.041
Intruder alert, deck 12.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.375
Another subspace reflection.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.375
Dimensional shift, sir.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.333
Go to Red Alert.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.333
Sound general quarters.

27:24.375 --> 27:27.375
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

27:34.792 --> 27:36.583
(<i> yelling</i> )

27:40.125 --> 27:42.667
Security to Engineering!

27:42.709 --> 27:44.709
Intruders in Engineering.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.667
Casualties reported

27:44.750 --> 27:46.667
on deck 12.

27:46.709 --> 27:47.959
Sick Bay responding.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.291
Seal off all decks.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.000
Lock on transporters

27:49.333 --> 27:51.000
to intruder signals.

27:51.041 --> 27:52.875
CREWMAN:

27:51.041 --> 27:52.875
Intruder signals unstable,

27:51.041 --> 27:52.875
Captain.

27:52.917 --> 27:54.125
I cannot lock on.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.959
They are moving

27:54.166 --> 27:55.959
interdimensionally.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.875
Neither transporters nor force

27:56.000 --> 27:58.875
fields will contain them, sir.

28:06.625 --> 28:09.041
(<i> ticking</i> )

28:21.750 --> 28:24.875
Explosive charge

28:21.750 --> 28:24.875
on the main warp chamber.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.625
Transporter Room 3,

28:26.667 --> 28:28.875
lock on to the explosive device

28:26.667 --> 28:28.875
and energize.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.625
CREWMAN:

28:28.917 --> 28:30.625
It's scrambling

28:28.917 --> 28:30.625
the sensors, Captain.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.959
I can't pinpoint it.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.959
Begin emergency evacuation.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.583
Stand by for saucer separation.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.542
Mr. La Forge, can you remove

28:34.625 --> 28:37.542
the charge from the engine core?

28:37.583 --> 28:39.625
I'm trying. Hold on.

28:39.667 --> 28:42.959
They've got it

28:39.667 --> 28:42.959
locked on somehow.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Stand by.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.875
Transporter Room,

28:54.542 --> 28:56.875
lock on my signal

28:56.917 --> 28:58.250
and stand by to transport

28:58.291 --> 29:00.542
two kilometers

28:58.291 --> 29:00.542
off the starboard nacelle.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.959
<i>His</i> signal?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.083
Transporter Room--<i> now!</i>

29:08.917 --> 29:10.500
Mr. La Forge, report.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.917
Transport complete, Captain.

29:12.959 --> 29:16.625
I have a man down.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.500
More dimensional shifts, sir.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.291
PICARD:

29:18.542 --> 29:20.291
Can you calibrate

29:18.542 --> 29:20.291
their destination?

29:20.333 --> 29:22.041
No, sir, the readings are...

29:31.542 --> 29:33.834
(<i> groans</i> )

29:33.875 --> 29:36.834
Security,

29:33.875 --> 29:36.834
Code 1 Emergency!

29:36.875 --> 29:38.583
Security!

30:20.291 --> 30:23.041
Lieutenant Worf is

30:20.291 --> 30:23.041
recovering in Sick Bay.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.959
The wound was

30:23.083 --> 30:25.959
not severe.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.542
Dead? Injured?

30:27.583 --> 30:29.750
Three dead, four wounded.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.750
Another millisecond

30:29.792 --> 30:31.750
and there would have been

30:31.792 --> 30:34.542
a big dust cloud orbiting Rutia

30:31.792 --> 30:34.542
instead of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:36.375
Why?

30:36.417 --> 30:39.000
I just asked

30:36.417 --> 30:39.000
if they would talk.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.125
You have

30:39.041 --> 30:41.125
your answer, Riker.

30:41.166 --> 30:43.125
WESLEY:

30:41.166 --> 30:43.125
Sir.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.875
The next time the Ansata

30:43.166 --> 30:44.875
use their dimensional jump,

30:44.917 --> 30:47.000
we should be able to get a fix

30:44.917 --> 30:47.000
on the power source.

30:49.083 --> 30:51.917
Worf went down.

30:51.959 --> 30:53.875
I don't know if

30:51.959 --> 30:53.875
he's alive or dead.

30:53.917 --> 30:55.834
And there were

30:53.917 --> 30:55.834
other casualties.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.834
Was Wes on the Bridge?

30:58.875 --> 31:01.625
Yes.

31:01.667 --> 31:03.542
He took cover.

31:03.583 --> 31:06.166
I didn't see

31:03.583 --> 31:06.166
any more than that.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.500
But you are

31:07.417 --> 31:09.500
all right, though?

31:09.542 --> 31:11.917
Yes, they needed

31:09.542 --> 31:11.917
a doctor.

31:11.959 --> 31:14.542
Uh-huh. The side effects

31:11.959 --> 31:14.542
of the transport.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.041
Yes.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.834
We're getting closer to

31:16.083 --> 31:18.834
tracing their movements.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.500
Actually, it was

31:18.875 --> 31:21.500
Wesley who put us

31:21.542 --> 31:24.083
onto this dimensional

31:21.542 --> 31:24.083
jump of theirs.

31:24.125 --> 31:26.542
He has been

31:24.125 --> 31:26.542
extraordinary, Beverly.

31:26.583 --> 31:30.166
He's going to make

31:26.583 --> 31:30.166
a very fine officer.

31:30.208 --> 31:33.083
He's had good role models.

31:39.959 --> 31:42.792
I'm sorry. If I'd only gone

31:39.959 --> 31:42.792
back to the ship...

31:42.834 --> 31:44.667
I should have

31:42.834 --> 31:44.667
beamed you up.

31:44.709 --> 31:45.959
You wouldn't dare.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.875
Oh, yes, I would...

31:46.000 --> 31:47.875
and should.

31:47.917 --> 31:49.125
Without my permission?

31:49.166 --> 31:50.500
If you don't

31:49.166 --> 31:50.500
follow orders...

31:50.542 --> 31:52.250
If you'd give reasonable

31:50.542 --> 31:52.250
orders, I'd obey.

31:52.291 --> 31:55.333
Doctor, I will be the judge

31:52.291 --> 31:55.333
of what is reasonable.

32:02.875 --> 32:06.667
There aren't any exits

32:02.875 --> 32:06.667
to the surface.

32:06.709 --> 32:10.000
So the only way out

32:06.709 --> 32:10.000
is by the transporter

32:10.041 --> 32:12.208
or the dimensional jump.

32:12.250 --> 32:16.000
A mode of travel

32:12.250 --> 32:16.000
I'd encourage you to avoid.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.250
It's killing them.

32:18.291 --> 32:20.583
They're mad.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.667
I don't know anymore.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.041
The difference

32:23.709 --> 32:26.041
between a madman

32:26.083 --> 32:29.250
and a committed man

32:26.083 --> 32:29.250
willing to die for a cause...

32:29.291 --> 32:33.792
it's all become blurred

32:29.291 --> 32:33.792
over the last few days.

32:33.834 --> 32:36.583
Beverly, I don't

32:33.834 --> 32:36.583
have to remind<i> you</i>

32:36.625 --> 32:38.959
of the psychological impact

32:36.625 --> 32:38.959
of being a hostage.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.834
I know.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.834
I understand that.

32:41.875 --> 32:45.917
But their leader, Finn,

32:41.875 --> 32:45.917
he's not what you'd expect.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.208
No, he's certainly not

32:45.959 --> 32:48.208
what I would expect.

32:48.250 --> 32:49.834
Without cause or reason,

32:49.875 --> 32:52.291
he and his little band of

32:49.875 --> 32:52.291
outlaws have attacked my ship.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.041
But he did have reasons.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.959
The medical supplies,

32:54.083 --> 32:56.959
the arrests...

32:57.000 --> 33:00.166
Jean-Luc, if we really examined

32:57.000 --> 33:00.166
our role in all this...

33:00.208 --> 33:01.959
Beverly, you are

33:00.208 --> 33:01.959
arguing for a man

33:02.041 --> 33:03.750
who may have

33:02.041 --> 33:03.750
murdered your son.

33:05.917 --> 33:09.458
I didn't kill

33:05.917 --> 33:09.458
your son,<i> Beverly.</i>

33:09.500 --> 33:12.125
We weren't able

33:09.500 --> 33:12.125
to destroy the ship.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.792
We had to settle for him.

33:13.834 --> 33:16.667
She wouldn't even

33:13.834 --> 33:16.667
tell me her name.

33:16.709 --> 33:18.750
I call her Doctor.

33:18.792 --> 33:20.792
You have made a grave

33:18.792 --> 33:20.792
miscalculation.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.125
Oh?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.333
You've assaulted

33:22.166 --> 33:24.333
a Federation starship,

33:24.375 --> 33:26.667
killed and wounded several

33:24.375 --> 33:26.667
members of her crew,

33:26.709 --> 33:28.667
kidnapped two

33:26.709 --> 33:28.667
of her officers,

33:28.709 --> 33:30.625
and you don't

33:28.709 --> 33:30.625
expect a response?

33:30.667 --> 33:32.959
On the contrary,

33:30.667 --> 33:32.959
I'm counting on it.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.750
You want Federation

33:33.000 --> 33:35.750
involvement?

33:37.250 --> 33:39.041
Captain,

33:39.083 --> 33:42.291
the Federation has

33:39.083 --> 33:42.291
a lot to admire in it,

33:42.333 --> 33:44.458
but there's a hint

33:42.333 --> 33:44.458
of moral cowardice

33:44.500 --> 33:47.041
in your dealings

33:44.500 --> 33:47.041
with non-aligned planets.

33:47.083 --> 33:50.709
You're doing business with a

33:47.083 --> 33:50.709
government that is crushing us.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.208
And you say

33:50.750 --> 33:52.208
you're not involved.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.917
You're very,

33:52.250 --> 33:54.917
very much involved.

33:54.959 --> 33:56.542
You just don't want

33:54.959 --> 33:56.542
to get dirty.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.083
You accuse us

33:56.583 --> 33:58.083
of cowardice

33:58.125 --> 34:00.166
while you plant

33:58.125 --> 34:00.166
bombs in shadows?

34:02.750 --> 34:05.625
I am fighting

34:02.750 --> 34:05.625
the only war that I can

34:05.667 --> 34:08.083
against an intractable enemy.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.083
Now, I'm fighting a big war

34:10.125 --> 34:12.709
against a more

34:10.125 --> 34:12.709
powerful adversary.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.000
Can't you see

34:12.750 --> 34:15.000
how that helps me?

34:15.041 --> 34:17.041
I'm afraid<i> I</i> can't.

34:17.083 --> 34:20.792
He's added another chair

34:17.083 --> 34:20.792
to the negotiating table.

34:20.834 --> 34:23.125
<i>You</i> added the chair, Captain.

34:23.166 --> 34:26.041
I am simply forcing you

34:23.166 --> 34:26.041
to sit in it.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.667
The Federation will quickly tire

34:26.083 --> 34:28.667
of our little war.

34:28.709 --> 34:30.250
They'll want you back.

34:30.291 --> 34:34.000
They will want to get

34:30.291 --> 34:34.000
as far from Rutia as they can

34:34.041 --> 34:35.917
and I will not make it easy.

34:35.959 --> 34:38.542
Eventually, the Federation

34:35.959 --> 34:38.542
will force the government

34:38.583 --> 34:40.709
into making concessions,

34:40.750 --> 34:43.959
and then a few more,

34:40.750 --> 34:43.959
and then... a few more.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.792
Until we can finally reach

34:44.000 --> 34:47.792
an honorable agreement

34:47.834 --> 34:50.792
that saves face

34:47.834 --> 34:50.792
for all sides--

34:50.834 --> 34:54.417
except... we win.

34:54.458 --> 34:58.291
You understand, I will not

34:54.458 --> 34:58.291
cooperate with you in any way.

34:58.333 --> 35:01.834
You've already cooperated,

34:58.333 --> 35:01.834
Captain...

35:04.125 --> 35:06.083
just by coming here.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.667
(<i> gasps</i> )

35:15.709 --> 35:18.083
I am not here to hurt you.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.208
Just hear what I have to say.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.041
Your people are safe.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.709
How long they stay that way

35:22.083 --> 35:24.709
depends on you.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.250
We demand an embargo

35:24.750 --> 35:28.250
and trade sanctions

35:28.291 --> 35:29.792
levied against Rutia.

35:29.834 --> 35:32.458
The Federation

35:29.834 --> 35:32.458
will blockade the planet.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.333
No ships will be

35:32.500 --> 35:35.333
allowed in or out.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.709
This will continue

35:35.375 --> 35:37.709
until the government of Rutia

35:37.750 --> 35:41.208
consents to talks mediated

35:37.750 --> 35:41.208
by a Federation counsel.

35:41.250 --> 35:44.500
You have 12 hours

35:41.250 --> 35:44.500
to make your decision.

35:51.125 --> 35:53.083
(<i> console beeping</i> )

35:53.125 --> 35:54.750
Got it.

35:59.208 --> 36:00.917
We've pinpointed

35:59.208 --> 36:00.917
the Ansata base

36:00.959 --> 36:02.917
as some 300 kilometers

36:00.959 --> 36:02.917
from the city

36:02.959 --> 36:04.458
on the southern tip

36:02.959 --> 36:04.458
of the continent.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.166
Sensors indicate

36:04.500 --> 36:06.166
it is located

36:06.208 --> 36:09.667
30 meters below the ground,

36:06.208 --> 36:09.667
implying a cavern-like dwelling.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.208
Any passages leading

36:09.709 --> 36:12.208
to the surface?

36:12.250 --> 36:14.834
Our readings show no evidence

36:12.250 --> 36:14.834
of any, Commander.

36:14.875 --> 36:18.500
Any light they have must be

36:14.875 --> 36:18.500
artificially generated.

36:18.542 --> 36:20.875
If we could

36:18.542 --> 36:20.875
shut that down,

36:20.917 --> 36:23.834
you could use the confusion

36:20.917 --> 36:23.834
to find your people.

36:23.875 --> 36:27.625
Request permission to join

36:23.875 --> 36:27.625
the rescue party, sir.

36:27.667 --> 36:29.709
I owe it to the Captain.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.333
Permission granted.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.875
You have the Bridge,

36:31.375 --> 36:32.875
Mr. Data.

36:32.917 --> 36:34.250
Aye, sir.

36:34.291 --> 36:35.959
Commander?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.375
Good luck.

36:37.417 --> 36:40.125
We'll bring

36:37.417 --> 36:40.125
them home, Wes.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.333
You're glad to see

37:05.083 --> 37:07.333
your Captain.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.750
Yes.

37:10.792 --> 37:12.625
I may have to kill him.

37:12.667 --> 37:15.417
I just wanted

37:12.667 --> 37:15.417
to warn you.

37:15.458 --> 37:18.291
He can help you, Finn.

37:15.458 --> 37:18.291
He is very influential...

37:18.333 --> 37:19.875
He will not help us.

37:19.917 --> 37:21.500
If you could just

37:19.917 --> 37:21.500
convince him that your...

37:21.542 --> 37:24.667
You may be able to

37:21.542 --> 37:24.667
convince him, perhaps, not I.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.583
I've talked to him.

37:29.792 --> 37:31.250
I'll try.

37:31.291 --> 37:34.959
If our places were reversed,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.875
I would expect to die.

37:39.166 --> 37:42.083
Your places would

37:39.166 --> 37:42.083
never be reversed.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.458
He would never

37:42.125 --> 37:44.458
forcibly abduct you

37:44.500 --> 37:46.333
or play games

37:44.500 --> 37:46.333
with your life.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.834
He would treat you

37:46.375 --> 37:47.834
with respect.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.458
I've treated you with respect.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.875
You've scared

37:49.500 --> 37:51.875
the hell out of me, Finn!

37:51.917 --> 37:53.667
You've controlled me

37:51.917 --> 37:53.667
through fear

37:53.709 --> 37:55.917
just like you've tried

37:53.709 --> 37:55.917
to control this whole continent.

37:55.959 --> 37:59.250
You haven't tasted

37:55.959 --> 37:59.250
<i>real</i> fear yet, Doctor.

37:59.291 --> 38:01.500
Is that the best you can do?

38:01.542 --> 38:03.917
Is fear the only weapon

38:01.542 --> 38:03.917
you have?

38:03.959 --> 38:06.542
No, but...

38:06.583 --> 38:08.291
it's a good one.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.834
You know what scares me

38:11.000 --> 38:14.834
the most, Finn?

38:14.875 --> 38:16.500
It scares me to think

38:16.542 --> 38:20.458
that you might win this fight

38:16.542 --> 38:20.458
and gain real power.

38:22.875 --> 38:24.417
Doctor.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.792
(<i> sighs</i> )

38:31.834 --> 38:33.875
I...

38:33.917 --> 38:36.625
I don't want you to fear me.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.917
(<i> equipment beeping</i> )

39:35.834 --> 39:37.500
(<i> both groan</i> )

39:48.041 --> 39:51.291
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

40:03.500 --> 40:05.792
The generator's

40:03.500 --> 40:05.792
right over there.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.917
MAN:

40:16.083 --> 40:17.917
Were the power packs

40:16.083 --> 40:17.917
distributed?

40:17.959 --> 40:19.917
WOMAN:

40:17.959 --> 40:19.917
Yes, sir.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.792
Beverly, how dangerous

40:27.250 --> 40:29.792
would another ride

40:29.834 --> 40:33.208
through the

40:29.834 --> 40:33.208
inverter be to us?

40:33.250 --> 40:36.125
I don't know,

40:36.166 --> 40:38.667
but I don't want you

40:36.166 --> 40:38.667
to start thinking about...

40:38.709 --> 40:41.125
Beverly, it is our obligation

40:38.709 --> 40:41.125
to think of escape.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.250
He's prepared

40:41.166 --> 40:43.250
to kill you.

40:43.291 --> 40:45.417
An excellent reason to escape.

40:45.458 --> 40:48.166
Do you think you've

40:45.458 --> 40:48.166
gained his confidence?

40:51.166 --> 40:53.208
(<i> paper rustles</i> )

40:58.792 --> 41:00.417
Indeed, you have.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.375
And more.

41:04.417 --> 41:06.917
This might prove

41:04.417 --> 41:06.917
to be an advantage to us.

41:06.959 --> 41:09.083
Jean-Luc...

41:15.041 --> 41:18.417
There are some things

41:15.041 --> 41:18.417
I want to tell you

41:18.458 --> 41:21.417
in case we don't

41:18.458 --> 41:21.417
get out of this.

41:23.917 --> 41:25.208
Have they found us?

41:25.250 --> 41:27.834
(<i> alarm buzzing loudly</i> )

41:27.875 --> 41:28.875
MAN:

41:27.875 --> 41:28.875
Right away!

41:28.917 --> 41:29.959
WOMAN:

41:28.917 --> 41:29.959
Look out.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.792
MAN:

41:30.000 --> 41:31.792
Samuel!

41:31.834 --> 41:33.083
Come with me.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.709
Do we have any emergency power?

41:53.625 --> 41:54.792
Freeze!

41:54.834 --> 41:57.542
Hold it right there!

41:54.834 --> 41:57.542
Hands up.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.291
Hands up.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.291
Let's go.

42:11.041 --> 42:12.709
Finn...

42:29.709 --> 42:31.750
He's dead.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.792
You didn't have

42:33.083 --> 42:35.792
to kill him.

42:38.375 --> 42:41.542
As a prisoner, he would have

42:38.375 --> 42:41.542
been a focus for violence...

42:42.667 --> 42:45.750
as his followers

42:42.667 --> 42:45.750
tried to free him.

42:45.792 --> 42:48.333
Now he's a martyr.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.709
But the death toll

42:48.375 --> 42:50.709
might go down,

42:50.750 --> 42:52.959
at least,

42:50.750 --> 42:52.959
in the short term.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.166
It's an imperfect solution

42:53.000 --> 42:57.166
for an imperfect world.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.250
Riker!

43:05.208 --> 43:07.083
No more killing.

43:30.709 --> 43:34.333
Already another one

43:30.709 --> 43:34.333
to take his place.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.083
It never ends.

43:36.125 --> 43:37.917
He could have killed you.

43:37.959 --> 43:40.208
He didn't.

43:40.250 --> 43:44.208
Maybe the end begins with

43:40.250 --> 43:44.208
one boy putting down his gun.

44:06.875 --> 44:08.458
I hear I owe

44:06.875 --> 44:08.458
my rescue to you.

44:08.500 --> 44:11.083
I was just part

44:08.500 --> 44:11.083
of the team.

44:11.125 --> 44:13.458
It's good

44:11.125 --> 44:13.458
to have you back.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.208
Both of you, sir.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.625
Take us out of orbit,

44:15.250 --> 44:17.625
Mr. Crusher.

44:21.917 --> 44:24.375
PICARD:

44:21.917 --> 44:24.375
At your convenience.
