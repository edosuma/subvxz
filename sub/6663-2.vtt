<i>Back in the '80s,</i>
<i>these were the dads on TV.</i>

00:06.107 --> 00:10.109
<i>They were loving, nurturing,</i>

<i>Now this was my dad,</i>
<i>Murray Goldberg,</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:18.250
<i>a man who lacked</i>
<i>both patience and pants.</i>

00:18.252 --> 00:20.185
Why you gotta be a moron
all the time?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.487
(MOUTH FULL)
What did I do?

00:21.489 --> 00:22.321
How many times
I gotta tell ya?

00:22.323 --> 00:25.024
Don't touch
the damn thermostat!

00:25.026 --> 00:26.125
It's like 900 degrees
in here!

00:26.127 --> 00:29.428
You don't get that 'cause
you're in your underpants
all the time.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.997
The AC is
for emergency use only.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.266
What do you think
I'm made of, cold air?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.134
More like hot air.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.568
Oh, that's so damn funny.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.936
<i>That's how</i>
<i>I remember my dad...</i>

00:37.938 --> 00:40.939
<i>Pants-less, pissed off,</i>
<i>and far from a millionaire.</i>

How many times?

00:52.520 --> 00:56.055
Ah! Ooh! Mom,
you gotta stop
watching me sleep.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.190
Well, if you'd let me stare
at you during the daytime,

00:58.192 --> 00:59.725
we wouldn't have to do
this little dance.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.360
I thought
I locked the door.

(LAUGHS)
Oh, please.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.531

About that...
I... I was thinkin',

01:08.002 --> 01:12.171
can I pick out my own outfit
for the first day of school?

01:15.275 --> 01:18.177
Okay. What size pants
do you wear?

01:18.344 --> 01:19.411
Uh...

01:19.413 --> 01:21.947
Three... Large?

(LAUGHS) See?
You need me.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.352
Mom, it's the first day
of seventh grade.
I wanna look cool.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.888
Well, who is cooler
than your mom?

Mom!

01:40.501 --> 01:43.135
<i>And so I went back-to-school</i>

01:43.137 --> 01:47.539
<i>I got new clothes</i>
<i>and new nightmares</i>
<i>all in one day.</i>

01:47.541 --> 01:48.407
Miss?
Whoa.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.177
I need the next size up
in these pants
for my little boy.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.046
These are too tight
in the crotchular region.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.316

<i>great with boundaries.</i>

01:57.318 --> 01:58.350
In the crotchal region!

01:58.352 --> 02:02.187
I can't send my son
to school like this,
but I like the pants.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.790
<i>While my mom had</i>
<i>a hands-on approach,</i>

02:04.792 --> 02:06.291
<i>my dad, not so much.</i>

02:06.293 --> 02:08.527
Don't come in here.
I'm watching TV.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.029
Come on. I'm going out.
Give me 20 bucks.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.865
No.
I need it.

02:12.867 --> 02:13.565
No.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.833
It's for my rap group.
No!

02:14.835 --> 02:17.035
How do you expect
Big Tasty to make it

02:17.037 --> 02:19.538
if his crew
can't cut a demo?

02:19.706 --> 02:21.940
Big Tasty?
(CHUCKLES)

02:21.942 --> 02:22.941
Who is Big Tasty?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.843
It's me!
It's my rap name.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.945
Your rap name should be
"Big Pain in my Ass."

02:26.947 --> 02:29.715
Now get out of here.
Go play in the street.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.883
Hey, Dad?
What?

02:30.885 --> 02:32.851
Can I have
20 bucks?
No.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.753
Please?
No!

02:34.888 --> 02:36.889

02:57.278 --> 03:00.946
You give Erica 20 bucks just
'cause she says "girl stuff"?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.948
My guy stuff has to
be worth something.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.751
It's not.
This isn't fair!

03:07.721 --> 03:08.720
Got it.
No.

No, that was
out of context.

Shame on you.

03:15.563 --> 03:19.031

How'd we get shame
on me already?

Barry's right.

(NORMAL VOICE)
You haven't known
how to deal with her.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.138
I mean, you don't even
yell at her anymore!

03:26.140 --> 03:28.740
Stop it. I yell at her
all the time.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.408
Oh, really?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.476
When was the last time
you called her a moron?

03:31.478 --> 03:34.780
She knows
I think she's a moron.
I don't have to say it.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.480
Yes, you do.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.249
She doesn't know
unless you tell her.

03:37.251 --> 03:40.652
Well, can't I just ignore
the other kids more?

03:40.654 --> 03:43.021
You are going to have
a daddy-daughter day
with Erica,

03:43.023 --> 03:45.357
like you used to do
when she was little.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.725
A whole day?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.728
I don't even
like spending a day
with myself.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.963
It's why I nap.

03:50.965 --> 03:51.697
You're doing it, Murray,

03:51.699 --> 03:53.832
and you're gonna smile
and have fun, damn it.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.002
Fine. I'll do
your daddy-daughter thing.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.605
But just know
you're overreacting.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.641
I'm quite comfortable
with the girl.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.645
Thanks, Mom.
Mmm-hmm.

with the food?

08:47.728 --> 08:48.960
So now you know.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.362
This is where I go
on the weekend.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.531
What happened to
your rap club?

08:52.533 --> 08:53.231
It was just my cover.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.334
Okay, you know,
you're supposed to cover
something embarrassing

08:56.336 --> 08:58.770
with something
less embarrassing, right?

08:58.772 --> 09:01.406
Your face
is embarrassing!
Ha, ha, ha!

09:01.408 --> 09:03.875
I've been coming here
the past two months.

09:03.877 --> 09:07.078
Skating helps me
blow off steam, you know?

09:07.080 --> 09:07.979
Roll it out.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.981
(LAUGHING)
Roll it out?
(LAUGHS)

09:09.983 --> 09:12.617
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Keep laughin'.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.318
It doesn't bother me.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.254
That's the great thing
about this place.
I get respect.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.357
Yes, from a 9-year-old
who just high fived you.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.027
He's almost 11!
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:23.563 --> 09:25.297
You know what?

09:25.299 --> 09:27.032
Just roll it out, Barry.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.433
Just roll it out.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.467
Roll it out.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.269
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
Roll it out!

09:31.271 --> 09:31.903
Yes!

09:31.905 --> 09:32.971
Your brother's wearing
a fanny pack.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.941
Oh, you know what?
I will take you up
on those nachos now.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.108
You got it, girl.
Let's go.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.911
<i>Finally, my dad</i>
<i>had found a way</i>
<i>to connect with Erica...</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:42.547
<i>By mocking</i>
<i>one of his other children.</i>

09:42.549 --> 09:43.582
What about, uh, Lainey?

09:43.584 --> 09:44.616
I thought you had to
call her back.

09:44.618 --> 09:49.054
Eh, it's fine.
She's kind of annoying me
right now anyway.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.057
You wanna talk about it
or something?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.459
Nah. It's girl stuff.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.695
All right. Why not?

09:56.697 --> 09:59.197
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.498
(LAUGHS) No.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.833
You'll just freak out.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.536
Me? Murray Goldberg?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.071
No. Come on.

10:06.073 --> 10:06.705
Let's go.

10:06.707 --> 10:10.909
No judgment. I promise.
No judgey-ness.

10:10.911 --> 10:11.943
You sure about that?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.279
No judgey-ness!
Let's go.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.014
All right.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.649
Me and Lainey are
kind of in a fight.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.385
What'd she do?
Uh, copy your homework?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.853
Smile at a boy you like?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.355
She got loaded
on peach schnapps

10:23.357 --> 10:25.023
and talked
all kinds of crap
about me.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.627
<i>My dad thought he was ready</i>
<i>to handle the girl stuff...</i>

10:28.629 --> 10:29.561
(WHISPERS)  <i>But he wasn't.</i>

10:29.563 --> 10:33.064
Well, it turns out
that his van is actually
his home, right?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.266
(SCOFFS)
And his real name
isn't Ron Bon Jovi.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.536
And he's not a roadie.
He had a keg in his van.

10:38.538 --> 10:39.904
Thank God I met
the nicest guy,

10:39.906 --> 10:43.308
and he was
selling these T-shirts
that he makes himself.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.476
And he has
all these dolphin tattoos

10:44.478 --> 10:47.379
because he really wants
to be a marine biologist.

10:47.381 --> 10:47.979
He was so built.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.849
And so we kinda took
a little trip down
to the ocean,

10:50.851 --> 10:54.219
and, uh, and he was rubbing
suntan lotion all over me,

10:54.221 --> 10:56.621
but it was kinda weird
because...

10:56.623 --> 10:57.288
Well, it was nighttime.

10:57.290 --> 11:01.126
<i>My dad wasn't the only one</i>
<i>in a new level of hell.</i>

11:01.128 --> 11:02.327
ADAM: Oh, my God!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.895
She shrunk my clothes!

11:03.897 --> 11:07.298
Let's not panic, kiddo.
It's really not that bad.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.101
Look at me! You can see
every little curve.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.970
I know Mom shrunk 'em
on purpose.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
Come on.
She'd never do that.

11:13.306 --> 11:17.442
Oh, yes, she would.
You just don't know her.

11:17.444 --> 11:17.976
I'm her father.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.513
Pops, I'm telling you,
that woman's an evil genius.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.914
Dinner's ready!

11:22.916 --> 11:25.383
I made your favorite,
shrimp parm.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.918
Oh, you made
my favorite?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.187
Well, it doesn't
make up for this.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.288
My goodness!

11:30.290 --> 11:33.391
What happened to
your cool clothes?

11:33.393 --> 11:34.793
You happened.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.195
(WHISPERS)
You happened.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.998
They must've shrunk
when I washed 'em.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.598
It was an accident.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.169
When it comes to
you and the laundry,
there are no accidents.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.704
I always wash new clothes.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.939
You don't know
who tried them on
before you.

11:47.941 --> 11:48.807
Could've been a drifter.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.909
What kind of drifter shops
at the Willow Grove Mall?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.844
Well, what kind of drifter
needs to buy new clothes

11:52.846 --> 11:54.446
when he already has
perfectly good ones?

11:54.448 --> 11:57.515
A drifter with a mom
who drove him to drifting!

11:57.517 --> 12:00.085
The open road was
his only way out!

12:00.087 --> 12:01.119
What's happening?

12:01.121 --> 12:02.320
I'll tell you
what's happening.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.423
You're gonna
wear the clothes
I bought you.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.491
They're perfectly fine.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.994
Holy God!
You did shrink 'em
on purpose!

12:09.996 --> 12:13.298
Okay, there are
some ugly accusations

12:13.300 --> 12:16.301
flying around this house
right now.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.737
Okay, now that
that's been resolved,

12:18.739 --> 12:21.372
I think we all need
to take a deep breath

12:21.374 --> 12:24.142
and put on
our adorable train sweater.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.511
I'll never wear
your train! Ever!

12:26.513 --> 12:29.347
(SCOFFS) Oh, these
are chaffing me,

12:29.349 --> 12:31.282
but I like it!

12:31.284 --> 12:34.419
Bevy, I spent a fortune
on those clothes.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.854
And that store was crazy.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.157
There was a boy
with earrings
in his nipples.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.658
I told you
not to mix in!

12:40.660 --> 12:43.595
But Adam wants
to look stylish.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.998
Oh, I know style.
I am style.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.968
They're just clothes.
Who cares?

12:49.970 --> 12:50.568
I care.

12:50.570 --> 12:55.006
Back-to-school shopping was
one of the last traditions
Adam and I had together.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.175
But now I guess
that's gone, too.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.011
<i>While my mom's plan</i>
<i>to bond with me</i>
<i>had blown up,</i>

13:00.013 --> 13:01.846
<i>my dad's plan</i>
<i>to bond with Erica</i>

13:01.848 --> 13:03.815
<i>was about to make</i>
<i>his head explode.</i>

13:03.817 --> 13:05.917
I mean, if you ask me,
the cop was overreacting.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.752
Like, it was obviously
a flare gun.

13:07.754 --> 13:11.089
So we take off running,
and I lose my shoe
climbing over a fence.

13:11.091 --> 13:15.026
There weren't any cabs,
but luckily this motor home
pulls up.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.194
Buh.
...really nice.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.462
Buh.
What?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.897
Buh! Ugh!

13:18.899 --> 13:20.498
Let's just go back
to silence,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.967
beautiful
daddy-daughter silence.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.869
No more stories!

13:24.871 --> 13:26.271
Why are you freaking out?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.939
I mean, it was all
Lainey's fault.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.673
Oh, how is that?

13:28.675 --> 13:32.410
Every decision you made
in that story
was a terrible one.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.812
You said no judgey-ness.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.613
I'm telling you,
your friend Lainey Lewis...

13:35.615 --> 13:36.948
She is big trouble.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.517
Big trouble!
You're never to
see her again.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.186
She's my best friend!

13:41.188 --> 13:42.387
She is banned!

13:42.389 --> 13:43.121
Banned for life!

13:43.123 --> 13:45.290
Oh, really?
No more talking.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.991
We're gonna roll it out!
Come on!

13:46.993 --> 13:49.093
Ugh! I knew
you couldn't handle it!

13:49.095 --> 13:49.961
Roll it out!
I knew.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.897
Uh, you know what? No.
I am not 10 years old
anymore.

13:52.899 --> 13:57.302
I don't like
roller-skating or unicorns
or slap bracelets.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.771
Don't you take off
the slap bracelet.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.873
That represents friendship.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.509
No, no, don't skate away
from me!

14:04.610 --> 14:06.678
Erica! Ah!

14:06.680 --> 14:09.714
All right.
I'm mergin' here.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.884
I'm mergin'.
Do you see
the sign for merge?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.719
Yield! Yield!

14:14.721 --> 14:17.255
Let me in! Let me in!
(WOMEN SCREAM)

14:17.257 --> 14:19.224
Let me... (SCREAMS)

14:22.661 --> 14:24.529
<i>Daddy-daughter day was</i>
<i>officially a disaster.</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:28.533
<i>Not only had Erica bailed,</i>
<i>but my dad's ankle</i>

14:28.535 --> 14:30.068
<i>and no one could</i>

14:30.070 --> 14:32.871
Barry,
I got your message.
Where's your father?

14:32.873 --> 14:33.504
The rink.

14:33.506 --> 14:37.108
Can you please
get him out of here?
He's embarrassing me.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.277
Is that my fanny pack?

14:39.279 --> 14:41.045
Just go!

14:43.515 --> 14:46.818
The merge! What the...
The merge!

14:46.820 --> 14:49.654
Murray. Murray!
The merge!

14:49.656 --> 14:51.289
Oh, my God,
look at your ankle!

14:51.291 --> 14:52.790
It's all swollen
and ballooning.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.693
What are you talking about?
It's the other ankle.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.694
Oh.
Ballooning?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.396
What are you even
doing here?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.230
This was your idea.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.133
You said take Erica out,
so I brought her here.

15:02.135 --> 15:07.505
You brought
your moody teenage daughter
to a roller skating rink?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.307
Mistakes were made.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.576
Uh... Some by me.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.280
I don't know what's going on
with my little peanut.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.116
The kid doesn't even
like unicorns anymore.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.451
She's growing up, Murray.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.988
They all are.

15:34.466 --> 15:37.435
I'd go with
the brown paper bag.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.271
Aw. But Adam
loves Kermie.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.307
You know what?
Your call.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.808
I'm not gonna mix in.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.010
No, you're right.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.079
And, uh, you were right
about the clothes.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.516
Adam is old enough
to pick his own clothes.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.653
But it's all just going by
so fast.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.388
And...

15:57.390 --> 16:00.358
It's hard because every year
he gets older,

16:00.360 --> 16:06.431
and I feel like I'm just
having to say goodbye
to a little boy

16:06.433 --> 16:08.499
I was just gettin' to know.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.469
I went through
the same thing with you.

16:11.804 --> 16:17.442
But you know what made
saying goodbye
to my little girl easier?

16:17.776 --> 16:21.179
I got to see
the woman she became.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.582
(CHUCKLES)

16:24.584 --> 16:29.854
Adam,
get your ass downstairs!
We're going to the mall!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.824
Thanks, Daddy.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.996
Oh, no!
They're closed.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.965
Nothing's closed until
I say it is.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.634
Hey! What are you doing?
We're closing.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.337
My beautiful boy
needs a pair of
acid-washed jeans,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.306
and he needs them
right now.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.408
Can't help you. Sorry.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.443
Sorry?
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.078
You don't know from sorry.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.415
If you don't let us in,
people will hear about it.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.549
Your co-workers,
your manager.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.285
I will call the CEO
of Jeans Express himself,

17:01.287 --> 17:05.023
and I will have him
dragged out of his important
meeting about jeans

17:05.025 --> 17:07.258
to let him know
that he has an employee

17:07.260 --> 17:09.594
so spiteful,
so petty, so cruel

17:09.596 --> 17:11.863
that she wouldn't let
a yummy boy

17:11.865 --> 17:13.464
shop for his first day
of school.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.199
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

17:15.201 --> 17:19.404
and I want you to think
about your answer
very carefully.

You do.

So today was, uh,
kind of a disaster, huh?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.385
A little, but...

18:07.453 --> 18:10.121
It was fun
busting on Barry.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.622
(LAUGHS) It was.

You know?

18:21.334 --> 18:24.469

I'm not here for you.

go to your mother first.
