29:12.166 --> 29:13.083
For what?

29:13.583 --> 29:16.458
Horses ain't the only thing
that need breaking around here.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.833
What are you talkin' about?

29:21.916 --> 29:23.791
[horse neighs]

29:26.750 --> 29:28.583
What the fuck is wrong with these people?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.583
-[group chattering]
-[man 1] Wheelbarrow it.

29:30.666 --> 29:33.541
[man 2] Hold up. Hold up, man.
Hold up. Hold up, y'all. Hold up, y'all.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.583
Hold up, y'all. I got him. I got him.

29:35.666 --> 29:38.750
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up. Yo. Yo, hold up.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.166
[group grows quiet]

29:43.583 --> 29:45.708
A shovel at a time will take you all day.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.375
I'm Paris.

29:49.291 --> 29:50.333
Cole.

29:50.416 --> 29:51.583
I know who you is.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.250
Grab that jawn right there
and meet me in the stable.

29:55.333 --> 29:58.083
-[rooster crows]
-[horse whinnies]

29:58.166 --> 30:00.458
[group chattering indistinctly]

30:01.666 --> 30:02.666
[Cole grunts]

30:04.375 --> 30:08.000
[Paris] Ain't gonna be green broke
no more. I'mma break your ass in.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.833
You gonna be doing all the stalls.

30:09.916 --> 30:11.458
You gonna be my new mucker.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.375
First, put that down.

30:13.458 --> 30:14.583
Get this pitchfork.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.791
[upbeat music playing]

30:16.875 --> 30:19.083
Start from the back.
Get all that shitty hay and all that.

30:19.166 --> 30:20.500
Get all that shit outta there.

30:21.083 --> 30:23.041
-All of that?
-[Paris] Get that shit.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.208
Go on. Get in there.
You ain't rakin' no leaves, man.

30:27.750 --> 30:31.291
See how that's cuttin' through?
Like a cake. There you go.

30:32.375 --> 30:36.083
-[Cole] Oh, shit.
-Try not to make a mess. Goddamn.

30:36.166 --> 30:37.916
-[Cole sighs]
-[Paris] Now put that down, man.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.333
Get that shovel.

30:41.250 --> 30:43.416
-[Cole exhales]
-Get big scoops. Big scoops, man.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.000
[Cole panting]

30:46.083 --> 30:48.291
[Paris] You outta breath already?
You just started.

30:48.791 --> 30:51.041
-[Cole] This shit heavy.
-Come on. You gotta hurry up.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.458
Tryna be in here all day?

30:52.541 --> 30:54.500
[Cole] No one told me
I had to do all this shit.

30:54.583 --> 30:57.291
Yeah. No one told me I was gonna have
a lazy-ass young boul here.

30:57.375 --> 31:00.208
-[Cole sighs]
-[Paris] Gonna fix your attitude today.

31:00.291 --> 31:03.541
You got more stalls to do.
You better get this shit done. Come on.

31:03.625 --> 31:04.625
[Cole exhales]

31:04.708 --> 31:09.666
[Paris] That's… That's white and tan.
That's good. Get the brown and green shit.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.333
Go ahead. Keep on pickin'.

31:11.416 --> 31:13.791
And all that wet shit.
Get that shit outta there.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.583
[Cole sighs]

31:17.083 --> 31:19.166
[Paris] Just take it out.
I wanna see the floor.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.041
Take it all out. I wanna see the floor.

31:21.125 --> 31:23.375
Now grab that sawdust
over there near the saddles.

31:24.833 --> 31:25.791
Just like that.

31:28.458 --> 31:29.833
Use the pitchfork.

31:31.625 --> 31:32.958
Make it nice and even.

31:35.916 --> 31:38.458
Come on, young'un, you did good.
Come on out, man.

31:39.291 --> 31:42.333
-[Cole exhales]
-[Paris] First stall from my end.

31:42.416 --> 31:44.083
-[Cole sighs]
-[Paris] You all right?

31:44.833 --> 31:46.125
[exhales] Yeah.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.958
Let me get a little smile.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.666
Little cheese. Cheese? Little something?

31:51.750 --> 31:54.250
-[sighs] Nah.
-[Paris] You're too hard for me, huh?

31:54.333 --> 31:56.375
It's all right. I'mma change that, though.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.666
[Cole exhales]

31:57.750 --> 32:00.750
-[crow cawing]
-[horse whinnies]

32:00.833 --> 32:03.666
[Paris] C'mon, no front-dumpin'.
Take it all the way up.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.500
Walk that plank.

32:07.875 --> 32:08.833
Get in there.

32:10.458 --> 32:12.166
[Cole takes a deep breath]

32:14.458 --> 32:17.166
-[grunts]
-[Paris] Whoa. Whoa. Hold it.

32:17.833 --> 32:20.250
Take it up. Go ahead. All the way up.

32:22.291 --> 32:25.791
-[Cole panting]
-[Paris] All the way up. You can do it.

32:26.416 --> 32:27.541
[Cole grunting]

32:34.375 --> 32:36.458
-[strains]
-[Paris] There you go.

32:36.541 --> 32:37.416
[Cole exhales]

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
[Paris] All the way up. All the way up.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.875
[Cole continues grunting]

32:43.291 --> 32:44.250
[panting]

32:45.333 --> 32:46.333
Now flip it.

32:47.750 --> 32:48.916
[Cole strains]

32:49.666 --> 32:50.708
[Paris] There you go.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.583
Yeah, young'un!

32:53.666 --> 32:56.666
-Yeah.
-[man 1] You got it! Good job! Well done!

32:56.750 --> 32:59.416
Yeah. There you go, young'un.
Yeah, there you go.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.250
[man 2] Stand up, junior!

33:01.333 --> 33:03.291
-[Cole panting]
-[Paris] Uh-huh.

33:05.333 --> 33:06.875
-You aight?
-[Cole sighs] Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.041
All right.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.958
-Come on. Let's go get some more shit.
-[Cole exhales]

33:12.041 --> 33:15.041
-[Boo nickers]
-[Paris] Let's do Boo's stall.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.166
[Boo sighs]

33:23.958 --> 33:26.625
-[Boo snorts, nickers]
-[Cole] So, you gonna take him out?

33:26.708 --> 33:27.875
Hell no.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.833
-[Cole] Why not?
-That motherfucker crazy.

33:31.416 --> 33:34.250
-So… So, what am I supposed to do?
-Shit, you sleep with him.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.416
Clean around him.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.333
[Boo grunts]

33:37.416 --> 33:40.625
-[Paris] Get in there.
-[Boo grunts, exhales]

33:42.083 --> 33:43.833
[Cole] Don't be wildin' out on me.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.416
Okay? We boys now.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.083
[Paris] Get up in there, man.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.666
[Boo nickers]

33:51.750 --> 33:52.958
-[Paris] Aight.
-Hey, back up.

33:53.041 --> 33:54.541
[Paris] Yeah. Don't let him come out.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.708
-Back up.
-[Paris] He get out, it's over. He gone.

33:56.791 --> 33:58.958
Back up. [grunts]

33:59.041 --> 34:01.708
-[Boo grunts]
-[Paris] All right. Now get up in there.

34:01.791 --> 34:04.000
Ain't nobody been in there
with Boo for a minute.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.791
-Clean all that shit outta there.
-[Cole] Right here? Right here?

34:07.875 --> 34:10.291
-Corners, all that. Get it out.
-[Cole] Shit.

34:10.375 --> 34:12.208
[grunts, sighs]

34:12.291 --> 34:15.583
So, how much does it cost
to take care of a horse?

34:16.166 --> 34:17.583
Could take your whole check.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.166
Sometimes I don't even eat
just to feed Little.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.791
[Cole] Which one of them is Little?

34:22.875 --> 34:24.791
[Paris] The quarter horse tied up outside.

34:24.875 --> 34:25.833
[Cole panting]

34:25.916 --> 34:27.875
[wheelbarrow rattles]

34:27.958 --> 34:30.291
-Why you name him Little?
-[Boo nickering]

34:32.666 --> 34:34.416
I named him after my little bro.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.166
Got killed a couple years ago.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.416
[sighs heavily] Sorry to hear that, man.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.541
[shovel thuds]

34:48.083 --> 34:50.125
[Cole takes a deep breath] So…

34:51.291 --> 34:53.250
So how you ride him, then?

34:53.333 --> 34:54.291
I don't.

35:00.541 --> 35:02.666
-[Boo nickers]
-[Cole] Oh.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.791
What you think they gonna do with Boo?

35:07.875 --> 35:09.166
[rooster crows]

35:10.291 --> 35:11.833
I guess that's up to you.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.916
Come on, man. Get your ass back to work.
Stop asking me all these damn questions.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.458
-[Boo whickers softly]
-[shovel scraping]

35:19.541 --> 35:21.125
[Cole exhales]

35:21.208 --> 35:23.750
-[indistinct chatter]
-[horses whinnying]

35:23.833 --> 35:25.833
[peaceful orchestral music playing]

35:25.916 --> 35:27.125
[children shouting]

35:44.583 --> 35:46.375
[horse neighs]

35:46.458 --> 35:48.250
-[group laughing]
-[man 1] What?

35:48.333 --> 35:50.708
-[man 2] Yeah.
-[man 3] Oh, okay.

35:50.791 --> 35:52.916
[man 4] That's 'cause you think
all cowboys was white.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.375
That's some Hollywood John Wayne bullshit.

35:55.458 --> 35:59.541
Fifty percent of all cowboys
were Black, brown, bronze,

35:59.625 --> 36:00.916
or some other color.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.583
[laughs] You said 50?

36:02.666 --> 36:04.583
Where you getting
them numbers from, nigga?

36:04.666 --> 36:07.708
Look it up! Real rap!
Even the Lone Ranger was Black.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.000
-Who's the Lone Ranger?
-Get the fuck outta here.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.916
-[Esha] Really?
-Harp, you teachin' this boy?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.458
Man, you doin' a good job.

36:13.541 --> 36:16.333
No, he's right.
Look, Hollywood has whitewashed us.

36:16.416 --> 36:19.916
They just deleted us
right out of the history books.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.333
They always trying
to delete us from history books.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.041
"Cowhand" became "cowboy."
Did you know that?

36:25.541 --> 36:27.083
That's what they called us.

36:27.166 --> 36:30.041
"Hey, boy.
Hold that cattle down while I brand it."

36:30.125 --> 36:32.208
"Hey, boy. Go break that horse."

36:32.291 --> 36:34.416
You know why we was able
to break them horses so good?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.458
-Why? Come on, why?
-[Esha] Why? Tell us.

36:36.541 --> 36:37.875
[man 5] Come on, Rome, tell us!

36:37.958 --> 36:40.083
-Tell them, Nessie. I gotta pee.
-[group laughs]

36:40.166 --> 36:45.000
People used to believe breaking a horse
meant crushin' the will of the animal,

36:45.083 --> 36:48.875
dominating 'em, making 'em believe
that the only way it was gonna survive

36:48.958 --> 36:50.625
was to submit, right?

36:52.458 --> 36:57.000
Well, Black folks, we knew
that a horse wasn't meant to be dominated.

36:58.375 --> 36:59.625
A horse is meant to be free.

36:59.708 --> 37:01.208
-[man 1] Yep.
-[Esha] That's right.

37:01.291 --> 37:07.041
Only way you can realize
its true spirit, its nature,

37:08.083 --> 37:09.041
is through love.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.750
-[Rome] Real rap. You feel that?
-[Paris] Become one.

37:11.833 --> 37:14.583
Where'd you guys come from
if all the Black cowboys got deleted?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.583
[man 6] I've been at it since I was nine.

37:16.666 --> 37:19.000
-[Nessie] Ooh!
-Right down here.

37:19.666 --> 37:22.500
Ridin' ponies
and drivin' horse and wagons.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.666
Oh, man. We here… We all over.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.625
History… The history here is deep.

37:26.708 --> 37:30.708
Everybody, like,
used to get their food from wagons.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.541
Horses and carriages,
buggies and all that.

37:33.625 --> 37:36.583
Uncle Charlie, like,
what we talk about? Back in the day--

37:36.666 --> 37:41.875
What happened with that was,
as the years was goin' on,

37:41.958 --> 37:45.500
the city decide
they don't need horses no more.

37:46.875 --> 37:48.625
-They was gettin' trucks.
-[man 5] Mm-hmm.

37:48.708 --> 37:53.541
So they said,
"Well, we don't need the horses no more."

37:53.625 --> 37:58.916
-But all of us down here, we love horses.
-[Harp] Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.208
And that's
how all these stables popped up.

38:01.291 --> 38:04.916
See, you got 31st Street,
you got 32nd, you got Cobb Creek.

38:05.000 --> 38:05.875
[Harp] Yup.

38:05.958 --> 38:07.625
-[Esha] Markoe Street.
-White House.

38:07.708 --> 38:10.208
[Rome] And the number one
on that list, 9th and Tioga.

38:10.291 --> 38:13.750
-Pfft.
-[group laughs]

38:13.833 --> 38:14.833
[Nessie] Here we go.

38:14.916 --> 38:17.916
You just gonna forget
about us Fletcher Street originals, huh?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.250
I'm talkin' about real riders.
Not no bitch-ass horse owners.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.458
Yeah, you right.
You know what? I do own all your horses.

38:24.541 --> 38:26.666
Same horses I been whupping your ass with.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.291
[Rome laughing] Oh!

38:28.375 --> 38:32.250
Time passed and,
one by one, they got shut down.

38:32.333 --> 38:33.750
-[man 1] Yep.
-Why?

38:34.958 --> 38:36.333
Real estate.

38:36.416 --> 38:40.750
Developers coming in, they see the horses,
they like, "Horses? Pfft. Fuck that."

38:40.833 --> 38:41.666
[Nessie chuckles]

38:41.750 --> 38:44.291
I mean, a lot of these boys
used to own their own stable.

38:44.375 --> 38:49.041
They runnin' up on these boys, like,
"Hey, this your land? Let me get that."

38:49.125 --> 38:50.666
Like, Fletcher Street, right here,

38:50.750 --> 38:53.916
we like some cowboy orphans,
you know what I'm sayin'?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.416
We like the la--
We like the Wild West out here.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.708
The last remainin'.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.666
-[siren wailing]
-[man 1 laughs] Yeah.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.625
[Rome] Ah, shit. Here we go, y'all.

39:01.708 --> 39:02.750
[siren chirps]

39:02.833 --> 39:04.958
Why you gotta make all that noise,
though, man?

39:05.041 --> 39:07.625
-Turn off them damn lights.
-[Paris] Come on, man.

39:07.708 --> 39:10.416
-Here come Leroy with his bullshit.
-[group groans]

39:10.500 --> 39:12.916
-[woman] Here we go.
-[Nessie] Here come the sheriff.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.083
[Rome] Oh, here we go.

39:15.416 --> 39:17.083
Is that marijuana I smell?

39:17.166 --> 39:19.625
[Paris] That's the fire can burning.
The fire can burning.

39:19.708 --> 39:21.041
Evening, gentlemen.

39:21.666 --> 39:22.916
-Nessie.
-[Nessie] Leroy.

39:23.000 --> 39:23.875
Esha.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.916
[chuckles softly]

39:28.833 --> 39:31.416

1:30:07.666 --> 1:30:08.833
Come on. Get up.

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:13.708
Come on. Let's get--
Come on. Sit you right here. [grunts]

1:30:15.708 --> 1:30:18.458

1:30:54.708 --> 1:30:56.416
I got you a different shirt.

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:58.625
[Cole continues breathing shakily]

1:31:00.041 --> 1:31:03.625
I'm just gonna… clean this up.

1:31:10.958 --> 1:31:11.958
[sighs]

1:31:22.166 --> 1:31:24.833
I feel like I was born
with a boot on my neck.

"Watch your back out there." [sighs]

1:31:39.041 --> 1:31:41.041
That's what my mama used to tell me.

1:31:42.708 --> 1:31:44.666
"Watch your back out there, boy."

1:31:49.250 --> 1:31:51.666
I don't know
who they expect us to grow up to be

1:31:51.750 --> 1:31:56.541
if we… watchin' over
our shoulder all our fuckin' lives.

1:31:58.750 --> 1:32:00.166

1:32:03.458 --> 1:32:04.708
[Harp sighs]

1:32:04.791 --> 1:32:09.625

on the back of a horse.

1:32:25.916 --> 1:32:28.041
[takes a deep breath]

1:32:30.250 --> 1:32:31.750

Go on.

1:32:40.958 --> 1:32:42.041

1:32:48.583 --> 1:32:50.166
Smush one of us, man.

1:32:56.958 --> 1:32:59.208
They may have put his body
in the ground already,

1:32:59.291 --> 1:33:01.291
but he ain't go in no cowboy.

1:33:04.375 --> 1:33:08.125
We gotta go get Chuck, get his boots.

1:33:10.541 --> 1:33:12.291
We're gonna put 'em on his grave.

1:33:17.541 --> 1:33:19.250
Let's give him his last ride.

1:36:24.666 --> 1:36:26.291
I've been out there three nights,

1:36:26.375 --> 1:36:29.208
waiting for your dumb asses
to drum up the courage.

1:36:31.750 --> 1:36:33.041
[Harp sighs]

1:36:34.625 --> 1:36:37.583
So now what? You here to arrest us?

1:36:38.458 --> 1:36:39.458
[horse neighs]

1:36:44.666 --> 1:36:47.583
Nah, I'm here to make sure
some rook with a sweaty trigger finger

1:36:47.666 --> 1:36:49.666
doesn't shoot your Black asses.

1:36:50.333 --> 1:36:51.583
[Harp scoffs]

1:36:51.666 --> 1:36:54.750
Come on, Harp. At least
make it look like something it ain't.

1:36:54.833 --> 1:36:57.958
You steal back the only horses
they seized down at Fletcher Street,

1:36:58.041 --> 1:37:01.250
it's gonna be a little too obvious
for them to ignore, don't you think?

1:37:02.250 --> 1:37:05.416
-[horse snorts]
-Come on, beautiful.

1:37:08.625 --> 1:37:09.875
Let's go.

1:37:10.458 --> 1:37:13.541
We'll let this one
and the others run around for a while,

1:37:13.625 --> 1:37:15.166
gather 'em up in the morning.

1:37:15.250 --> 1:37:18.833
And it just so happens
yours can't be found.

1:37:20.083 --> 1:37:22.875
So look,
I suggest you lay low until morning.

1:37:24.333 --> 1:37:28.000
Or at least until everybody remembers
we have actual murders to solve,

1:37:28.083 --> 1:37:30.375
and gets bored lookin' for some lost pets.

1:37:32.333 --> 1:37:34.583

Pops, we can't just watch this go down.
We… We gotta do something.

1:42:25.416 --> 1:42:28.708

1:42:54.583 --> 1:42:57.166
Yeah. Let 'em take the stables.

1:42:57.250 --> 1:43:00.750
Let 'em take 'em 'cause they can't take
who we are as a… as a people.

1:43:02.291 --> 1:43:05.458
Home ain't a place. It's a fam.

-[Amahle] My goodness. Wow.

1:45:56.125 --> 1:45:59.083
-Oh, he's so beautiful.
-[Harp] Yeah, he got his own horse.

1:45:59.166 --> 1:46:01.583
I mean, he's still got a lot to learn.
He ain't no me.

1:46:01.666 --> 1:46:05.000
-[Cole] I ain't no-- I'm better than you.
-[Harp] Ain't no ole Harp, man.

1:46:05.083 --> 1:46:07.458

-[Harp] Better than who? What?

1:46:08.291 --> 1:46:09.958
-Come on, man.
-[Amahle laughs]

1:46:10.041 --> 1:46:11.625
[calming instrumental music playing]

1:46:36.375 --> 1:46:38.416
Even when we riding around,
people'll be like,

1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:42.708
"Uh, where do the horses come from?"
Or, "How did they get around here?"

1:46:42.791 --> 1:46:47.083
These horses been here before me.
Know what I'm saying? So it's like…

1:46:49.666 --> 1:46:53.541
when we telling this story,
I want people to sit back and just look

1:46:54.500 --> 1:46:57.333
and see, like, this is…
this really… this is really happenin'.

1:46:58.125 --> 1:47:03.250
And they do this, and…
people got good days and bad days.

1:47:03.333 --> 1:47:06.083
And that's, like, regular.
That's, like, regular life.

1:47:06.166 --> 1:47:07.375
And this is life.

1:47:08.416 --> 1:47:09.375
I live in Philadelphia.

1:47:09.458 --> 1:47:11.500
And there are people,
all the time, who say to me,

1:47:11.583 --> 1:47:14.625
"What do you mean, you ride horses? Where?
There are no horses in Philadelphia."

1:47:14.708 --> 1:47:17.750
It's like, "What are you talking about?
There are horses all over Philadelphia."

1:47:17.833 --> 1:47:20.208
And, like, yes,
in North Philly, we ride horses.

1:47:20.291 --> 1:47:22.500
Like, we have horses.
We take care of the horses.

1:47:22.583 --> 1:47:25.291
And I think that
if more people knew about it

1:47:25.375 --> 1:47:30.583
and knew how important the stable
was to so many people, young people,

1:47:30.666 --> 1:47:32.291
who don't have anywhere else to go.

1:47:32.375 --> 1:47:35.666
I think I get more enjoyment
out of watchin' the kids

1:47:35.750 --> 1:47:37.375
that I actually teach…

1:47:37.875 --> 1:47:39.333
Watching them kinda, like,

1:47:40.125 --> 1:47:43.875
them absorb it and then adapt
and then make an adjustment,

1:47:43.958 --> 1:47:46.958
not just with a horse,
but just in life itself.

1:47:47.041 --> 1:47:49.583
The stable, like,
it does… it does a lot for us.

1:47:49.666 --> 1:47:51.375
Like, you know,
I can pretty much sit here

1:47:51.458 --> 1:47:53.583
and say that I'm in my forties right now,

1:47:53.666 --> 1:47:56.541
and I believe in my heart
because of this stable

1:47:56.625 --> 1:47:58.875
that's why I don't have
a felony on my record.

1:47:58.958 --> 1:48:01.208
You know what I mean?
Or nothing like that. It just--

1:48:01.291 --> 1:48:02.958
It helps keep you on a straight path

1:48:03.041 --> 1:48:05.333
