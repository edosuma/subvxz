03:07.437 --> 03:09.882
Kleinman! Kleinman, open up.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.276
- Kleinman!
- We know you're in there.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.487
- Kleinman!
- You bastard!

03:16.113 --> 03:18.457
Open the door. Kleinman!

03:18.949 --> 03:20.225
Come on, Kleinman.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.952
Kleinman!

03:22.744 --> 03:25.230
I'm coming, I'm coming.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.082
- Kleinman!
- Kleinman, come on.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.192
- What?
- For God's sake, Kleinman, are you deaf?

03:29.292 --> 03:31.862
What do you mean, deaf?
What's, what's... What's going on?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.905
- We need you to get dressed.
- Get dressed? Why?

03:34.005 --> 03:34.990
Don't play ignorant.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.867
I was playing ignorant?
I was in a deep sleep.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.203
- We expect the killer to strike again tonight.
- The killer? What killer?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.413
The strangler.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.165
- What strangler?
- The maniac.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.709
The one who killed Eisler's son
and choked Jensen to death

03:45.809 --> 03:47.085
with the piano wire.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.587
Jenson?

03:48.687 --> 03:51.214
The big night watchman?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.817
That's right. Took him from behind.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.886
Crept up, got him by the throat.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.846
He was blue when we found him.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.790
Saliva frozen down the corner
of his mouth.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.895
Well, look, I've got to be up
early tomorrow for work, so...

04:04.995 --> 04:06.855
Don't play dumb, Kleinman.
You live on an island?

04:06.955 --> 04:09.316
Tonight's a foggy night.
He always strikes in the fog.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.400
Yeah, but, you see, I...

04:10.500 --> 04:12.361
This is a very busy time
for me in my firm.

04:12.461 --> 04:16.490
You know, I'm in competition
for a promotion with Simon Carr...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.742
Don't you know no one can walk
the streets at night?

04:18.841 --> 04:19.910
Yeah, well, you know, I hear certain...

04:20.010 --> 04:21.244
And it's not just the streets.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.372
The Quilty sisters
were killed in their own home

04:23.472 --> 04:24.831
because they didn't lock the door.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.708
Throats cut from ear to ear.

04:26.808 --> 04:27.918
I thought you said he was a strangler.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.378
Does it matter how he kills?

04:29.478 --> 04:30.921
So angry, what is he...

04:31.021 --> 04:33.090
Hey, what's he gettin' so angry for?
Okay.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.863
Okay. There's no motive?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.259
So, you know about it.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.763
Well, you know,
I hear, now and then, a drib and drab.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.431
He hears what he wants to hear.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.516
Get dressed.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.434
What do you mean, get dressed?
This is police business.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.519
The police have had their chance.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.104
Now we're taking matters
into our own hands.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.188
No, that's scary.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.564
You're one of us, aren't you, Kleinman?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.108
Yes, yes, I'm definitely one of you.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.275
What do you want me to do?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.694
We have a plan to trap him.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.861
Yeah, but, what kind of plan?

04:54.961 --> 04:55.987
It's Hacker's. He should tell it.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.072
What, well, Hacker, what's...

04:57.172 --> 04:58.240
You'll find out your assignment.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.950
Get dressed. You're wasting time.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.052
- What do you mean?
- We'll meet you downstairs in five minutes.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.620
Well, okay, but...

05:03.720 --> 05:05.956
My theory is that
it's someone that we all know.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.625
Someone, you know, that we work
next to or go to church with.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.228
He lurks in the shadows,
waiting to pounce.

05:11.561 --> 05:15.156
But, you see,
I was in a deep sleep, so I was...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.802
What is this plan? How can I be of help?

05:18.902 --> 05:21.325
Kleinman. Kleinman. In, in, in, in.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.454
Kleinman, here.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.228
- I brought you some pepper.
- Pepper? What...

05:28.328 --> 05:29.354
I overheard everything.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.315
If you're caught by the maniac,
blow pepper in his eyes.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.652
Yes, very good.
I'll ward him off with a seasoning.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.238
This is ridiculous. I'm petrified.
I'm not gonna go out.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.656
Be a man, Kleinman.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.741
What do you mean, be a man?

05:40.841 --> 05:44.286
Suddenly, in the middle of the night,
I gotta put on a suit and a tie and...

05:44.386 --> 05:45.412
What do you need a tie for?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.061
You're going to hunt
for a homicidal maniac.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.085
Do I know who I'll run into out there?
What if I see my boss?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.628
You know, Mr. Paulsen is funny that way.

05:53.728 --> 05:58.091
And there's a big competition between
me and Simon Carr for this promotion.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.968
What are you
killing yourself for that promotion?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.304
What does it mean? An extra few dollars?

06:02.404 --> 06:04.514
No, I told you. It isn't the money.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.599
I wanna amount to something.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.142
Why should Carr get the promotion?

06:07.242 --> 06:09.352
You know, because
he takes Paulsen to dinner all the time?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.813
I mean, you're
too frightened of Mr. Paulsen.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.523
You cringe in front of him like a worm.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.610
Well, he makes me nervous.
And I don't cringe.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.779
Calling your boss
"Your Majesty" is cringing.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.073
Stop it. I don't like this.
I don't wanna have to go out.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.576
I was in a nice warm bed.
Suddenly I'm part of a plan.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.787
When are you gonna
come to your senses and marry me?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.330
You could tell your boss to stuff it

06:28.430 --> 06:30.248
and you'd own half of this whole place.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.875
I'm not gonna marry you.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.460
I have a fiancée. What are you...

06:33.560 --> 06:35.437
Some fiancée.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.048
Eve wants you for an ornament,
if you get the promotion.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.716
Don't... Don't talk about Eve.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.302
I don't wanna discuss this all the time.
Eve is a lovely creature.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.155
Eve treats you like scum. Be careful.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.890
I'd hate for them to find you
in an alley

06:46.990 --> 06:49.618
with your throat slit from ear to ear.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.125
Don't worry about that.
He mostly strangles.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.855
Gee, it's empty.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.942
Where, where is everybody?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.524
They're supposed to be here.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.314
Where the hell did they go?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.691
The street's so desolate.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.913
I don't like this.
I wanna get back into bed.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.599
I can't do that, though.

07:29.699 --> 07:34.079
If something goes wrong
with their plan, they'll say it's my fault.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.089
Why me?

08:05.610 --> 08:09.911
I'm an artist. Every town we played in,
I'd get huge laughs.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.041
And here, nothing.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.854
I mean, no one comes, and the few that do
just sit there stone-faced.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.440
I know. I was very little
appreciated myself.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.649
None of us were.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.652
Well, your specialty
is quite different to mine.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.155
I don't know about that.
I, I was thinking you can tell a lot

08:25.255 --> 08:28.533
about an audience by how they respond to
a good sword-swallower.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.911
Mmm, believe me,
nothing is more terrifying

08:31.011 --> 08:34.121
than attempting to
make people laugh, and failing.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.874
So, why do we put up with it?

08:35.974 --> 08:40.211
When we pull out tomorrow, why don't
we just tell Danzig we're quitting?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.337
To do what?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.048
Well, settle down.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.050
Where we don't have
to travel all the time,

08:45.150 --> 08:47.653
where it's not such a grueling life.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.847
Get married, you know.
Live like other people.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.577
We're not like other people.
We're artists.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.771
With great talent comes responsibility.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.900
But it would be so nice.
You could find a job someplace.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.861
But then doing what?
Collecting other people's refuse?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.279
- No.
- Sweeping the streets?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.031
Of course not. No, you're clever.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.075
Somebody'd give you an opportunity.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.975
But I have a rare opportunity now,
to make people laugh.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.815
To make them forget their sad lives.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.794
Listen, it's not my fault
that this stupid traveling show

09:20.894 --> 09:23.147
is completely mismanaged.

09:23.897 --> 09:28.949
I'm sure Danzig steals
every cent of profit.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.804
I wanna have a baby.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.598
We're going to have a baby,
but not right now.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.498
A family? That's death to the artist.
I need peace and quiet.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.665
I mean, you know, my mind...
It's funny...

09:42.207 --> 09:44.710
It's just constantly filled with, um,

09:45.376 --> 09:49.656
new routines, ideas, gags,
brilliant and creative twists.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.408
Why don't you tell the truth?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.076
You don't want to get married.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.897
So, you can play cards
and flirt with all the adoring ladies.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.498
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.535
I just want to...
I have to make a name for myself first.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.688
We will get...

10:05.897 --> 10:07.132
You know, I love you.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.075
No. You keep promising.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.162
But soon it's gonna
be too late for me to have a baby.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.324
But, too... Don't cry.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.686
Listen, I'll talk to Danzig.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.021
You don't mean it.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.216
I do mean it. Stop.
You know I can't stand that.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.092
Don't cry.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.746
The audience was too quiet tonight.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.166
I felt sorry for you.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.656
You're the only one they seem to like.

11:06.071 --> 11:08.985
Yeah, but I have
my little tricks for seducing them.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.177
Yes.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.137
What are you doing
wandering around out here?

11:15.633 --> 11:18.136
I was on my way to speak to Danzig.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.262
Mmm.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.772
Like Irish whiskey?

11:22.223 --> 11:26.820
Uh, yes, but my doctor
says it's very bad for my stomach.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.693
Oh. That's too bad.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.118
But, uh...

11:35.737 --> 11:38.490
It's probably relaxing.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.361
The most voluptuous woman in the circus.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.931
It would be my luck
she'd be married to the strongman.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.519
Don't worry about Peter.
He's had a gallon of this already.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.313
You know, sometimes
when you're up on the high wire,

12:06.517 --> 12:08.690
I look at you. You look so...

12:11.439 --> 12:12.841
What?

12:12.941 --> 12:15.114
Mmm. Edible.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.994
How hungry are you now?

12:20.949 --> 12:24.294
I'm always famished after a performance.
And you?

12:25.703 --> 12:28.331
I can never sleep on an empty stomach.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.252
Do you have a taste
for anything special?

12:33.628 --> 12:37.178
I'm not fussy.
I eat what you put in front of me.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.869
And you're sure
your husband won't wake up?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.997
I mean, I have seen
what he does to iron bars.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.020
Nothing wakes Peter up.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.937
Certainly not the sound
of two people moaning.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.536
Oh, you.
I thought I saw you come in here.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.770
- Hey...
- Rat! You rat!

13:07.870 --> 13:08.980
Irmy!

13:09.080 --> 13:10.857
You said you were going to Danzig.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.901
You were supposed to go to Danzig.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.569
Shh! My husband. Shh!

13:14.669 --> 13:16.046
Damn you!

13:16.296 --> 13:18.656
Wait! We were talking about acrobatics.

13:18.756 --> 13:19.908
Oh, acrobatics.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.826
I was showing him how to do a backbend.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.411
You never take your eyes off her.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.081
You're always standing
under her trapeze, looking up her legs.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.124
I see you.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.084
Because we're planning this routine.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.563
Sure you are.
What do you take me for anyway?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.216
And I wanted to have a baby with you.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.718
I know. We'll continue this later.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.929
- Later?
- I know, but I don't wanna have a baby.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.972
- Oh, you're such a pig.
- I told you...

13:43.072 --> 13:44.574
You are a pig.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.808
But, I told you a thousand times.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.435
I don't want a baby with you anyway.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.396
I don't want a baby
if you were the last man on earth,

13:50.496 --> 13:52.148
I don't want a baby with you.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.274
Good!

13:53.374 --> 13:55.818
You're never gonna have to see me again.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.886
Good. Good riddance.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.511
I like my freedom.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.497
Oh, Doctor.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.665
What do you want, Kleinman?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.208
I'm sorry to disturb you.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.709
Can I come in, just for a minute?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.562
Would it be possible? I have a question.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.548
Are you in on the plan?

14:17.648 --> 14:18.883
Of course I am.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.510
Didn't you think I would be?

14:20.610 --> 14:23.363
I wanna find out my assignment.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.099
Please, don't disturb anything.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.642
No, no, no, I wouldn't think of it.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.542
I just wanna find out
my participation in the plan, you know.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.565
Of course, I wouldn't mind
having a little drink though.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.692
A drink?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.111
You know, the fog. It's a little damp.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.603
So I, you know...

14:40.703 --> 14:42.907
But not if it's an imposition.

14:43.707 --> 14:47.888
You know, I've never been here before.
This is an interesting...

14:49.639 --> 14:50.623
Oh.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.225
It's cheerful.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.317
I'm performing an unusual
amount of autopsies these days.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.821
Yes, I'm sure.
That's probably what accounts for

14:59.941 --> 15:02.677
so many of those
human fingers lying around.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.470
You don't generally see that.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.700
I guess the, the maid doesn't
get in that often to straighten up, so...

15:09.200 --> 15:14.172
My interest in all this murder business
is entirely scientific.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.249
I'm sure, I'm sure.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.210
I'm determined to use this opportunity

15:19.502 --> 15:22.346
to find out something definitive about

15:23.089 --> 15:24.887
the nature of evil.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.897
Why is the killer the way he is?

15:31.514 --> 15:35.690
Sometimes certain impulses
that can drive an insane man to murder

15:35.935 --> 15:38.734
inspire others to highly creative ends.

15:39.564 --> 15:43.301
Once I have him here, on this table,

15:43.401 --> 15:46.701
dismembered and scrutinized

15:47.822 --> 15:49.620
in minute detail,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.686
then I shall know
the answer with certainty to questions

15:53.786 --> 15:56.539
that now I can only speculate on.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.798
Yeah, but it's
not possible that under the microscope

16:01.002 --> 16:02.570
there's something
that you could never see?

16:02.670 --> 16:06.925
What are you implying?
Uh, a spiritual element?

16:07.717 --> 16:11.261
A soul that lives on after we're dead?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.477
A God?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.863
Ask him if there's anything else.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.531
What are you thinking now?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.262
I just must remember next time

16:28.362 --> 16:30.890
I go out to a restaurant...

16:30.990 --> 16:33.118
...not to order the sweetbreads.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.625
Kleinman, you'd better go.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.252
The time is growing very short.

16:39.832 --> 16:44.087
So, there's nothing you can tell me about
my participation in the plan?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.176
I'll go.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.946
The doctor was no help at all.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.942
This is ridiculous. Where is everybody?

17:07.944 --> 17:10.446
Unless, this is part of the plan.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.349
Maybe they have me under surveillance.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.454
If anything bad happens,
they'll come running out and grab me.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.773
Unless they don't come running out.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.720
But they could never think that
I'd be any match for a maniac.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.975
A deranged person is supposed to
have the strength of ten men.

17:32.176 --> 17:36.602
I have the strength of
one small boy with polio.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.626
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

17:40.726 --> 17:43.855
It's Bretschneider. He's been strangled.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.158
The killer may still be near.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.594
Poor Bretschneider.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.351
He had no enemies.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.768
Don't be afraid.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.313
I'm sorry I scared you.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.713
Oh, you... You really did scare me.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.925
I didn't see you
standing there in the shadows.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.472
It's such a foggy night.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.844
I was just going into town.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.581
You should be indoors.

19:01.081 --> 19:02.871
It's not safe.

19:02.971 --> 19:04.839
I don't care.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.064
What was that?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.449
I don't know.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.681
What are you doing out here tonight?

19:16.781 --> 19:20.081
I'm used to the streets.
It's how I make my living.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.995
Oh.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.415
What do you do?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.009
Oh, I... I work with the circus.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.425
Well, you should have stayed there.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.240
Don't you know what's lurking
in this fog?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.138
I'm never going back.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.395
Oh, I see.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.957
That's how it is.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.334
Except I have no place to sleep.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.103
And I'm getting cold.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.966
Come on, I'll find you
a place at the house.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.342
The house?

19:53.442 --> 19:54.989
The whorehouse.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.450
Me?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.681
It's warm. You'll get something to eat.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.142
It's a lot safer in there
than it is out here.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.019
Come on. Stop looking at me like that.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.121
You'll have your privacy.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.796
Hi, everybody. This is Irmy.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.445
She's with the circus.
She needs a place to flop tonight.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.030
What do you do in the circus, huh?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.157
I'm a sword-swallower.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.826
A sword-swallower?
That's my specialty, too.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.036
Yeah. She's pretty good at everything.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.120
You hungry?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.496
Yes, starving.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.248
Good. Just in time for dinner.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.375
We got some stew. Come on.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.171
- I don't mind spanking them.
- Oh, I do.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.298
But when I have to speak
in the nanny's voice...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.467
Wait, wait,
the strangest one that I ever had

20:34.567 --> 20:36.302
was when I had to
make believe that I was twins.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.554
- Twins?
- I've never worked so hard.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.389
Well, he should've hired
the Beckman sisters.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.515
- Oh!
- They're identical triplet whores.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.558
They cost a fortune, though.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.645
Oh, I hear they're on special call
to a sultan in Morocco.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.873
Why would any man want identical whores?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.400
If you're gonna hire two or three women,
wouldn't you want some variety?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.818
The worst was the businessman

20:52.918 --> 20:54.236
- from Budapest...
- Oh!

20:54.336 --> 20:56.238
...and his crazy fantasies.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.406
He sent me out at 3:00 in the morning

20:57.506 --> 20:59.533
to see if I could buy
six pounds of butter.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.860
I had to walk him on a leash.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.581
They all look so innocent and dignified

21:05.681 --> 21:07.458
when they walk in here, don't they?

21:07.558 --> 21:10.528
Then you hear the things
they want you to do.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.380
I think this is shocking Irmy.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.090
- Is it?
- No, no, no. Not at all.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.842
No. I was just...
I was just thinking that,

21:16.942 --> 21:19.637
for me,
I just don't think it would be possible,

21:19.737 --> 21:22.098
for me to, you know,
just take money from someone

21:22.198 --> 21:24.642
and then pretend to feel passion.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.894
I just don't think I could do it.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.771
I never thought I could either.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.023
Till my husband needed an operation.
We had no money.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.733
You're married?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.443
Yeah, I was.

21:34.543 --> 21:39.239
After he pulled through, realized how
I'd paid the hospital, he left me.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.534
Yeah, good riddance.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.787
Well, so, that they'd...
The customers don't mind

21:44.887 --> 21:46.560
that it's just all mechanical?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.817
Without any feeling or anything?

21:50.059 --> 21:51.877
Mind? Ours is the only business

21:51.977 --> 21:53.587
that hasn't been affected
by the killings.

21:53.687 --> 21:57.533
That's right. There's only one thing
men will brave murder for.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.969
That little furry animal
between our legs.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.721
Now, let me tell you something.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.348
Men and women want
very different things out of sex.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.433
Oh, that's for sure.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.810
- They've never forgiven each other.
- Uh-huh.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.396
Well, where...
Where would you say love came in?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.815
Oh, now, there's only
one kind of love that lasts

22:12.915 --> 22:14.859
that's unrequited love.
It stays with you forever.

22:14.959 --> 22:15.985
- Oh.
- You take it from me.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.759
Oh, Dorry! You're pitiful.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.656
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.324
No, she's just bitter about marriage.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.516
I am not bitter.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.661
- Yeah, you are.
- Uh-uh.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.246
Marriage. Let me tell ya.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.290
Let me tell you gals
somethin' about marriage.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.834
You gotta work at marriage.
I mean, like anything else.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.586
A good marriage takes a lot of work.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.463
When it starts feeling
like work, it's over.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.260
- No. Come on.
- No, it's all luck.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.885
- It's all luck.
- Why?

22:40.985 --> 22:42.783
We're all so dependent on luck.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.806
I would rather not admit that,
if you don't mind.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.409
How... How can it all be luck?

22:49.118 --> 22:51.395
- Well, let's say this guy...
- Yeah.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.658
...likes to be sat on.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.441
I'm serious.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.318
And ridden
around the room by a naked woman

22:57.418 --> 23:00.404
who keeps digging her spurs into his...

23:00.504 --> 23:01.596
...into his side.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.392
Yeah, Dorry. Show her your spurs, Dorry.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.121
What does he do? He meets maybe 50 women

23:09.221 --> 23:11.332
and when he tells them,
they faint or they laugh.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.292
Or both.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.376
And then they die.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.421
Maybe a few good sports,
you know, do it just to please him,

23:17.521 --> 23:20.508
but sooner or later they say
"What the hell is this?"

23:20.608 --> 23:22.360
"I'm riding around on a man's back."

23:24.486 --> 23:26.159
"This is insane."

23:27.907 --> 23:31.713
"And my, my spurs are getting,
you know, blunt."

23:32.077 --> 23:33.062
Bloody.

23:33.162 --> 23:36.982
And then one day he meets a woman
who gets her own erotic pleasure

23:37.082 --> 23:39.881
by putting on spurs
and riding men around.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.089
It's a marriage made in heaven.
Sheer bliss.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.432
- You know, Paul is...
- But what are their chances?

23:46.216 --> 23:48.844
My boyfriend, Paul, he's really sweet.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.564
It's just that he's an artist, you know.

23:52.848 --> 23:56.193
And, a family's death to an artist.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.687
I can understand that.

24:01.857 --> 24:06.158
I'm sure you'd all find him very funny.
He's really something.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.373
Except when I see him out there...

24:09.573 --> 24:11.392
In his makeup,

24:11.492 --> 24:16.105
just getting knocked around,
and falling into a big tub of water,

24:16.205 --> 24:17.940
with all the people laughing,

24:18.040 --> 24:22.216
I can only think he must have
suffered so to act like that.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.515
Ah, finally. The rent.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.732
We got exams.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.670
- There's more in back.
- Is that right?

24:39.770 --> 24:41.547
Yeah, we're just
the welcoming committee.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.340
Well, does that mean
that I have my choice?

24:43.440 --> 24:44.741
Mmm.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.017
Your credit's always good, Jack.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.915
Who's the new girl?

24:55.703 --> 24:57.580
She doesn't work here.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.440
God, she's beautiful.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.634
She doesn't work here, Jack.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.170
I want her.

25:06.922 --> 25:07.969
Hi.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.102
I'll give you anything you want.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.809
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.540
Oh...

25:16.640 --> 25:19.043
Oh, no, I'm just spending
the night here.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.378
Well, that's all I plan to do.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.900
Sorry.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.323
I'll give you $20.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.109
I'm afraid not.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.928
- Fifty.
- Sorry.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.180
- Fifty.
- Not that I'm not flattered.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.157
It's very nice of you.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.267
Hundred dollars.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.244
Jack, she's not a professional.

25:40.998 --> 25:43.275
Two hundred dollars.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.218
These rich crazies.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.987
University students.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.906
They wear you out
before you get to the back room.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.950
I'll give you $500 to spend
an hour with me.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.270
I'll spend the rest
of the year with you for $500.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.205
That certainly is an exorbitant sum.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.289
You're worth it.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.438
How do you know?
I might be very disappointing.

26:02.686 --> 26:03.671
Six hundred. Cash.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.547
What's wrong with you? Can't you hear?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.257
She said she wasn't interested.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.868
You know,
you just might be a little drunk.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.263
Listen, you're the
most desirable woman I've ever met.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.432
I wanna make love to you.
I'll give you $700.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.267
You can have all of us for 700.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.694
We'll even throw in the dog, too.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.315
Seven hundred dollars, it's all
I won in cards tonight. It's for you.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.192
Jack, you're making a fool of yourself.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.070
Some people can't be bought,
not for any amount of money.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.948
Listen, you're really
the most sensual woman I've ever seen.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.676
It's a quick $700.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.224
Go right there in the back room.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.516
What do you say?

26:43.018 --> 26:44.770
Let me see the 700.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.274
Oh, whoo!

26:59.034 --> 27:01.257
Can we use the back room?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.916
How did you get in?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.662
Did you think you could keep me out?

27:43.954 --> 27:46.173
So, I'm the next on your list?

27:46.957 --> 27:48.300
What list?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.755
I can't quite see your face.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.050
What difference does that make?

27:56.300 --> 27:58.268
Do you think I fear you?

28:00.137 --> 28:02.265
Does that give you pleasure?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.816
Although I admit,

28:05.934 --> 28:10.110
I was taken a little bit by surprise.

28:15.777 --> 28:19.623
I see, you're very determined.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.208
And yet I feel no fear.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.231
Only pity for you.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.004
You mean for you.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.257
Why are you doing this?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.197
Oh...

28:35.297 --> 28:38.200
What a foolish question
to ask an irrational mind.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.077
What do you know about my mind?

28:40.177 --> 28:45.855
I know that if I were to examine
the inside of your brain,

28:46.433 --> 28:48.481
I should find chaos.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.131
And yet I am anxious
to know where insanity stops

28:52.231 --> 28:53.465
and evil begins.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.533
So many questions.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.424
No!

29:57.963 --> 30:00.386
No! No!

30:00.841 --> 30:03.139
No!

30:05.512 --> 30:07.731
Ahhh!

30:25.824 --> 30:28.418
Well, you're $700 richer.

30:30.072 --> 30:32.168
You can start a new life.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.249
God, I'm thirsty.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.091
- You were wonderful.
- Mmm.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.281
Thank you, but it's not necessary
that I be wonderful.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.324
I was paying.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.892
Still.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.429
Listen, tell me the truth.

30:47.971 --> 30:51.976
Did you close your eyes and grit
your teeth and think of the cash?

30:52.726 --> 30:56.129
Well, at first I did, yes.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.948
But then I think I just,
I think I just relaxed into it.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.194
Now I feel so strange, though.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.113
Strange in what way?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.703
I don't know. Not like me.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.918
Not like you.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.460
Or was it the real you
for the first time?

31:16.583 --> 31:19.257
All right. Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.364
Come on. Where's the next one?

31:22.464 --> 31:24.825
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.035
What is this? What's going on here?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.870
Social undesirables.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.331
The police said
they may be involved in the killings.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.209
That's the Mintz family. I know them.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.460
They're very lovely people.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.714
He does quality circumcisions.
I've seen his work.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.550
If I were you, I'd mind my own business.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.176
Well, this is crazy.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.179
They're not... They can't be responsible
for the killings.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.140
I'm gonna speak to the chief of police.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.559
My theory is that if they
take them to jail,

31:50.659 --> 31:52.832
all these killings might stop.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.741
Kleinman. Did you wanna speak to me?

32:05.841 --> 32:06.908
Would that be possible?

32:07.008 --> 32:07.951
Sit down.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.453
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.413
- You're up rather late.
- I know.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.206
Don't you have to work tomorrow?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.625
Yes, I do have to go to work, but I...

32:15.725 --> 32:18.378
You're not involved
with one of those various street gangs?

32:18.478 --> 32:20.526
No. The vigilantes?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.407
- Oh, you know?
- Uh...

32:23.024 --> 32:25.093
Well, you hear stories, you know, but...

32:25.193 --> 32:26.261
I'm against them.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.429
Yes, no, I am, too.

32:27.529 --> 32:28.701
Good.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.475
What did you want? I'm very busy.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.769
I don't wanna take up any of your time.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.813
I just wanted to
discuss the Mintz family if I could.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.756
Oh, yes. Unfortunate.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.942
There may be a connection
between all these killings

32:41.042 --> 32:44.529
and certain well-poisoning incidents.
You understand.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.784
But those accusations are so wrong.
I mean, they're just not true.

32:48.884 --> 32:52.454
Maybe they are, maybe they're not.
What do you know about it?

32:52.554 --> 32:54.289
Well, I don't know anything.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.875
I myself have no personal
knowledge of anything.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.752
But the Mintzes are lovely people.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.213
Don't look so apprehensive, Kleinman.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.443
It'll probably never go any deeper than
the more orthodox elements.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.097
You see, nobody's guilty of anything.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.140
Kleinman, there's pressure on me

33:12.240 --> 33:13.809
to get to the bottom of these killings.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.268
You're not worried, are you?

33:15.368 --> 33:16.812
No one lumps you in with the Mintzes.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.231
You're fine.
So don't get your nose dirty.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.484
You know, besides, I have my own
theories about what's going on.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.712
The doctor's been murdered.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.949
We think there may be
someone trying to copy the murderer.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.326
We found a glass
with fingerprints on it.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.994
- What kind of glass?
- It's a sherry glass.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.538
- How many prints?
- We got a lot of prints.

33:34.638 --> 33:35.622
Prints on the glass?

33:35.722 --> 33:37.315
We got fingerprints all over the glass.

34:07.671 --> 34:10.031
Okay, I'm coming.
You don't have to push me.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.867
Will you just let go of me?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.076
How many times do I have to tell you?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.161
Hey, Bok, you need handcuffs?

34:14.261 --> 34:16.036
I don't work at the brothel.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.289
What's this?

34:17.389 --> 34:19.458
Turning tricks at Felice's place.
No license.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.001
I work at the circus.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.210
- Stand there. She's loaded with cash.
- The circus.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.130
Where's a dame like you get big money?

34:25.230 --> 34:27.090
- Well, I...
- Yeah, we know.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.675
What did you do? The whole regiment?

34:28.775 --> 34:30.135
- Very funny, very funny.
- Look at this one.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.887
I work at the circus.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.722
You'd think they'd
cool off with all this going on here.

34:33.822 --> 34:34.889
I haven't seen you around here before,

34:34.989 --> 34:36.683
so I'm gonna go easy on you.
Fifty dollar fine.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.643
- I don't work at the brothel.
- Uh-huh.

34:38.743 --> 34:39.728
Put some handcuffs on her.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.730
Okay, here.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.024
Fifty dollars, fifty dollars, okay.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.359
- But I don't work at the brothel.
- Let me give you a piece of advice.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.777
Can I go home now, please?

34:47.877 --> 34:49.987
You don't solicit around here
unless you got a license.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.072
I know.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.199
We like things hygienic
and well-regulated.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.076
I'll give you a receipt.
What's your name?

34:55.176 --> 34:56.870
- I don't need a license.
- What's your name?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.497
- Irmy.
- How do you spell it?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.917
I-R-M-Y. I don't need a license.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.418
- Just pipe down.
- I work at the circus.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.961
You're not getting a license.
You're getting a receipt.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.129
Now just be quiet.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.214
You work here, you need a license.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.237
Boy, this is ridiculous.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.201
What are you staring at?

35:36.301 --> 35:37.393
Me?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.454
I'm not a whore.

35:39.554 --> 35:43.083
What did I say? You know...
Do I care what your hobbies are?

35:43.183 --> 35:45.311
I... I'm just... You know...

35:46.269 --> 35:47.712
Are you all right?

35:47.812 --> 35:48.964
Yeah.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.299
It's not safe to be
out on the street tonight, you know.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.968
Then what are you doing out?

35:53.068 --> 35:55.053
Well, I'm part of a citizens' committee

35:55.153 --> 35:57.997
to patrol the streets,
so it's okay for me.

35:58.740 --> 35:59.808
Are you from around here?

35:59.908 --> 36:02.457
No, I'm with the circus.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.646
The circus? Really?

36:04.746 --> 36:08.467
I saw the circus. Which one are you?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.235
I'm the sword-swallower.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.861
The sword-swallower,
I didn't recognize you.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.655
You look completely different.

36:13.755 --> 36:17.931
Well, I know. I wear a beautiful
costume and my hair is different.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.203
I went to see Almstead the magician

36:20.303 --> 36:21.705
because he's a favorite of mine.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.456
I'm an amateur magician myself.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.417
You know, just something
I do in my spare time.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.711
And I idolize him.
He's an artist, a great artist.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.337
Yeah, he's an artist when he's sober.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.422
Well, you know...

36:30.522 --> 36:32.882
Listen, is there
a hotel or something around here?

36:32.982 --> 36:35.051
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.323
It's late.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.306
So, when you have
the sword down your throat,

36:39.406 --> 36:41.829
what happens if you get hiccups?

36:53.628 --> 36:56.781
Jesus. You know, I don't know my
way around this part of town.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.450
I don't think there's gonna be

36:58.550 --> 37:01.202
a hotel open at this hour, you know.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.872
I think I should wake up my fiancée
and you could sleep on the sofa.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.040
Oh, no, I don't want to wake anybody up.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.208
She would be glad to.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.652
You know, it's... It's so foggy.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.363
He strikes in the fog, you know.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.884
You didn't hear anything, did you?

37:15.984 --> 37:17.552
- Footsteps.
- You're so tense.

37:17.652 --> 37:21.122
Well, I'm usually in bed, you know,
this time of night.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.224
What would you do

37:23.324 --> 37:25.352
if you came face to face
with the killer?

37:25.452 --> 37:27.729
I'd throw pepper in his eyes.

37:27.829 --> 37:28.813
Really?

37:28.913 --> 37:30.815
My landlady put some pepper
in my pocket.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.734
I think I could handle myself.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.381
Kleinman!

37:35.044 --> 37:36.279
What are you doing here?

37:36.379 --> 37:38.740
Oh, my God! You scared me.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.367
Who is she?

37:40.467 --> 37:41.743
She's just a friend.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.912
Do you happen to know my assignment?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.622
Who gave you permission to socialize?

37:45.722 --> 37:47.165
I'm not socializing.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.460
You know, she's... Maybe you recognize her.
She's with the circus.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.608
She's the sword-swallower.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.632
She's unescorted.
I was just walking next to her.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.801
We're getting closer to the zero hour.

37:57.901 --> 37:59.594
Yeah? So what do I do?

37:59.694 --> 38:01.596
- Don't you know?
- No. That's the point.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.181
You know, you got me up,
in the middle of the night

38:03.281 --> 38:05.016
and no one's told me
what I'm supposed to be doing.

38:05.116 --> 38:09.104
Kleinman, I swear, if anyone is killed or
hurt as a result of your incompetence.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.272
No, I don't know enough
to be incompetent.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.691
You know, they don't tell me
what I'm supposed to...

38:12.791 --> 38:14.734
All right, just don't make a noise,
and listen to me.

38:14.834 --> 38:17.428
There is someone lurking up the alley.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.885
Well...

38:20.173 --> 38:24.349
Shall I just start weeping
or would you like me to break into a run?

38:24.719 --> 38:26.329
It's a chance to trap him.
Whoever it is.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.872
No. I don't wanna trap anybody.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.125
We'll get reinforcements.
There's three of us only.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.794
What they say about you
isn't true, is it?

38:32.894 --> 38:37.715
You're not really a coward
or a worm or a yellow-belly?

38:38.090 --> 38:41.445
No, but keep going.
You're in the right column.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.972
All right, I'll circle around the block.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.181
You head straight up the alley.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.726
No, I don't wanna do this.
No, this is, this is trouble.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.311
- I can go with you.
- No! She's gonna go with me.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.938
What good are you? You're a small woman.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.415
- She's gonna, you know...
- I'm okay.

38:54.582 --> 38:59.154
You go first. It'll throw his timing off
if he sees a body.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.405
Go on, Kleinman.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.634
It'll take me a moment or two
to get round the other side.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.557
Keep ahead of me.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.399
Those are my knees knocking.

39:21.401 --> 39:24.200
Stay calm.
The trick is not to show fear.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.296
There he is! Look!

39:38.251 --> 39:41.129
Grab him! Grab him!

39:46.843 --> 39:48.536
- Kleinman!
- Mr. Paulsen!

39:48.636 --> 39:49.662
You know him?

39:49.762 --> 39:51.289
This is my boss.
He's the head of my firm.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.209
- What are you doing here?
- I'm part of the plan, Your Grace.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.336
- Why did you attack me?
- I thought...

39:56.436 --> 39:58.379
"Thought"?
Since when do you think, Kleinman?

39:58.479 --> 40:00.465
Yes, you're right,
Your Majesty. I shouldn't have...

40:00.565 --> 40:02.592
I had a suspicion you were incompetent,

40:02.692 --> 40:04.636
hiding behind
the efforts of your co-workers.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.387
Don't let him talk to you like that.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.972
- What?
- He was peeping in that window

40:08.072 --> 40:09.390
watching that woman getting undressed.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.517
- How dare you.
- He was.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.851
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.853
She's swallowed too many sharp objects.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.522
Don't be a doormat for this Peeping Tom.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.065
This is my boss. He's my boss.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.566
To think that I was undecided

40:18.666 --> 40:20.568
about your abilities versus Simon Carr.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.238
Yes, what can I say, sir?
You looked dangerous.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.781
I didn't know you were merely peeping.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.908
Why didn't you attend
to your function in the plan?

40:27.008 --> 40:28.243
I don't know my function.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.787
You don't know?
You unreliable simpleton.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.455
- Don't call him a simpleton.
- No, well put.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.582
- It was well put.
- You're a disgusting old man.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.000
No, don't say that. Go away.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.961
Go away, Miss. Whoever you are, go away.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.921
Go away, go away. Leave us alone.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.273
Paulsen?

40:42.065 --> 40:45.134
You gave us quite a scare. I sent Kleinman
round here to check you out.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.303
He was just, you know, looking in the
window. There was a woman...

40:47.403 --> 40:49.722
Mark my words, he'll be a detriment.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.641
No, sir. Don't say that, sir.
Let me block your hat.

40:51.741 --> 40:52.767
No, give me that.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.102
Sir, you... I'm sorry.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.854
He's always been a liability
with my firm.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.897
I'm only just now beginning
to realize it.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.591
Mr. Paulsen, I didn't mean it. You...

41:01.209 --> 41:02.301
Sir!

41:04.253 --> 41:05.721
Irmy!

41:13.721 --> 41:14.813
Irmy!

41:30.446 --> 41:31.472
We're closing.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.370
Just one beer? Please?

41:44.419 --> 41:49.095
Did anyone see a blonde woman
wandering around alone?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.717
Short hair.

41:51.426 --> 41:55.538
Oh, mercy.
We never know when we have a good thing.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.686
We always have to ruin it.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.602
I know exactly how you feel.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.693
The earthly paradise known as woman.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.525
All we'll ever know of heaven.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.737
All we need know of hell.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.808
I made love to a woman tonight
that was sheer perfection.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.018
And it's true it was in a brothel,

42:17.118 --> 42:20.998
but somehow this one
didn't have that used, jaded quality.

42:21.122 --> 42:23.250
I never do it with whores.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.735
You start out with a burning desire

42:25.835 --> 42:29.885
and end up the next day with a burning
sensation, if you know what I mean.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.472
Yes, but this one was so irresistible.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.020
Sweet and innocent.

42:36.929 --> 42:40.479
But under the sheets, a tigress.

42:41.267 --> 42:46.148
A violent, screaming,
passionate jungle cat.

42:47.356 --> 42:49.050
You mean a good actress.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.652
She swore not.

42:51.736 --> 42:54.831
Well, you're very young, my friend.
Very naive.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.725
She dug her nails into my back.

42:57.825 --> 42:58.810
I'm sure.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.396
And then she yelled
"Don't stop! Don't stop!"

43:01.496 --> 43:05.149
Yes. And stuck her tongue inside my
mouth and wiggled it around.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.923
I'm sure it was well worth the $20.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.343
Twenty? I paid her 700.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.263
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Tell me another one.

43:14.425 --> 43:18.020
I'm afraid you've
never made love with a sword-swallower.

43:20.515 --> 43:22.188
I beg your pardon?

43:24.519 --> 43:26.587
She claims she never took money before.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.736
And if she was acting,
she should win a prize.

43:29.941 --> 43:34.071
It's true that I put on
a heroic performance, if I do say so myself.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.347
She brought out the stallion in me.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.042
And when she said she loved it,
I believe she was sincere.

43:40.368 --> 43:44.522
I think she's got a lover who doesn't
service her too well, you know?

43:44.622 --> 43:46.215
Some poor clown.

43:46.874 --> 43:49.718
But I showed her
what a good one felt like.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.884
What's wrong? You look incredulous.

43:56.926 --> 44:00.180
I swear, the dirtier I got,
the more she screamed.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.583
I gave her the best time
she's had in years,

44:03.683 --> 44:05.626
and I believe she loved it.

44:05.726 --> 44:09.026
Not that I have
any further urge for her, you know.

44:09.147 --> 44:12.151
The difference between
love and lust, I guess.

44:15.570 --> 44:19.245
When my friend wakes up,
tell him I went back to Felice's.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.061
This is crazy.
Can't I talk you out of it?

44:23.161 --> 44:26.522
No, I don't want it.
I want the church to have it, all of it.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.858
Yeah, but you're talking about $700.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.318
- That's a lot.
- Six hundred and fifty.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.986
I had to pay a fine.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.572
But so, you know, you...
But it's your money.

44:34.672 --> 44:35.656
Why give it away?

44:35.756 --> 44:37.992
Because I'm ashamed of the way I got it.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.619
Listen, I'm sure you didn't steal it.

44:39.719 --> 44:42.097
No. I slept with somebody for it.

44:43.556 --> 44:44.540
Yes?

44:44.640 --> 44:47.484
Just one person.
Does that make me a whore?

44:47.894 --> 44:50.379
Well, only by the dictionary definition.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.340
Anyway, I'm giving it to the church.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.966
Yeah, but that seems so silly.

44:54.066 --> 44:57.616
You know... It's work, you know.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.514
I'm sure you didn't do it for fun.

44:59.614 --> 45:00.765
No.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.976
But you know something?
It turned out to be fun.

45:04.076 --> 45:07.188
Here. Would you take it in there for me
and give it to them?

45:07.288 --> 45:09.440
- Me?
- Yeah. For the poor.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.527
I just can't bring myself
to go in there tonight.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.721
Please? Come on.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.162
- Excuse me, I'm...
- Yes?

45:23.262 --> 45:25.248
I just need a minute of your time.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.708
I think you can see that we're busy.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.836
I just... Just for one...

45:29.936 --> 45:32.280
Put Kramer's name on the list.

45:32.772 --> 45:35.716
Have you seen his sketches
and his photo studies?

45:35.816 --> 45:37.885
Just for a minute,
if I might have your attention...

45:37.985 --> 45:39.178
Just for one moment.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.701
Didn't you hear him say we're busy?

45:43.282 --> 45:44.475
Are you Kleinman?

45:44.575 --> 45:46.998
Yes. Yes, I am. Yes.

45:48.496 --> 45:49.964
Don't forget.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.902
Why is he putting my name on the list?

45:55.002 --> 45:56.070
You've been warned twice now.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.948
What is this list? Might I just ask?

45:59.048 --> 46:00.449
I have a donation to make.

46:00.549 --> 46:01.826
The poor box is in the front.

46:01.926 --> 46:04.162
No, this doesn't fit in the poor box.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.581
Kleinman, you want me to take you in?

46:06.681 --> 46:08.900
No, no, no. I have $650.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.835
Six hundred and fifty dollars?

46:10.935 --> 46:12.253
Don't worry, it's not stolen.
He thinks it's stolen.

46:12.353 --> 46:13.462
Where did you get it?

46:13.562 --> 46:16.549
I assure you.
My friend said I should donate it.

46:16.649 --> 46:17.884
Where did your friend get it?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.969
I don't think that
we don't have to pry excessively.

46:20.069 --> 46:23.073
We humbly accept
this token from the faithful.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.893
And I think
that we know how to show gratitude

46:26.993 --> 46:29.792
when someone performs an act of charity.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.721
Manna for the poor.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.490
Did you do it?

46:41.590 --> 46:44.059
- Yeah, I took care of it.
- Oh.

46:45.043 --> 46:47.188
I feel so much better now.

46:47.288 --> 46:49.265
- Good.
- Are you a religious person?

46:49.557 --> 46:50.833
Me? No, I'm not.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.085
You're the second person tonight
to ask me that question.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.630
The doctor, may he rest in peace,
wanted to know.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.090
- Do you pray ever?
- No.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.051
'Cause my people pray
in a different language,

47:00.151 --> 47:01.969
you know, I never understood
what they were saying.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.579
For all I know, you know,
they were requesting their own troubles.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.241
Help me.

47:08.743 --> 47:12.213
Please help me. Help.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.315
- Are you all right?
- Who is that?

47:14.415 --> 47:15.837
I'm hungry.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.254
I need to buy food and milk.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.929
My husband is dead.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.035
I'm alone.

47:26.135 --> 47:29.355
We're friends.
You know, you're among friends.

47:30.514 --> 47:32.667
Go back and get some of the money back.

47:32.767 --> 47:33.834
What are you talking about?

47:33.934 --> 47:36.003
I want her to have half of it.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.339
I can't get the money back.
I just gave them the money.

47:38.439 --> 47:41.008
So what? Just ask for half back.

47:41.108 --> 47:44.136
You just gave it to them.
They give it to the poor, don't they?

47:44.236 --> 47:47.556
Well, theoretically they do,
but a lot of it is used

47:47.656 --> 47:50.751
to buy costumes
and velvet pillows and stuff.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.395
Please.

47:52.495 --> 47:53.496
Oh...

47:54.747 --> 47:57.108
My friend asked me
if I could possibly come

47:57.208 --> 47:59.485
and just have
half the money back that I gave you.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.462
Just $300. It would...

48:03.255 --> 48:04.598
Thank you.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.975
Kleinman.
Is that with an "ei" or an "ie"?

48:10.638 --> 48:12.561
Put a circle around it.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.571
Eve. Eve, open up.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.482
It's Kleinman.

48:22.149 --> 48:26.262
Eve. Eve, it's an emergency.
It's me. It's Max.

48:26.362 --> 48:27.638
This is a bad idea.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.662
No, she's a wonderful girl.
Very intelligent.

48:30.783 --> 48:31.830
Eve!

48:32.326 --> 48:33.418
Eve!

48:34.328 --> 48:37.064
What are doing here at this hour?
Who is this?

48:37.164 --> 48:38.607
Can we come in?

48:38.707 --> 48:39.959
What's going on?

48:40.126 --> 48:42.903
She's a friend of mine.
She has no place to sleep tonight.

48:43.003 --> 48:45.301
I told her she could sleep on your sofa.

48:45.464 --> 48:46.741
You did?

48:46.841 --> 48:50.345
We're sorry.
It's much too much of an imposition.

48:50.761 --> 48:53.372
You dare to wake me out of a deep sleep

48:53.472 --> 48:56.726
so that some
complete stranger can sleep on my sofa?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.837
She's not a complete stranger.
She's a friend.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.840
You know, Eve,
I personally vouch for her.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.863
I apologize, Miss.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.219
Kleinman, have you been drinking?

49:07.319 --> 49:10.289
Have I been... When do I ever drink?

49:10.531 --> 49:12.767
Since when is she your friend?

49:12.867 --> 49:15.936
Since tonight.
I met her at the police headquarters.

49:16.036 --> 49:18.773
They brought her in
when they raided the brothel.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.316
It's not what it sounds like.

49:20.416 --> 49:23.465
You know, everybody
makes one mistake now and then.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.572
Kleinman, what are you
doing out at this hour?

49:26.672 --> 49:30.159
I'm part of a vigilante committee
to help catch the maniac.

49:30.259 --> 49:31.761
By doing what?

49:32.636 --> 49:34.434
I don't exactly know.

49:35.806 --> 49:38.980
Go home, Kleinman.
And take your friend with you.

49:40.478 --> 49:44.073
You've got some nerve.
We'll discuss this in the morning.

49:49.736 --> 49:52.240
Boy, Eve is a cold fish.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.583
There. I said it.

49:54.950 --> 49:58.750
Is it hard for you to admit
certain things to yourself?

49:59.580 --> 50:03.426
Usually it is, yes.
But for some reason tonight is different.

50:04.293 --> 50:07.763
You know, it's a strange feeling
to be up at this hour.

50:08.172 --> 50:11.267
The city is so odd
when everybody's asleep.

50:11.592 --> 50:12.618
You know, it's like a

50:12.718 --> 50:13.744
- different place completely.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:13.844 --> 50:17.289
There's no civilization.
The stores are closed.

50:17.389 --> 50:19.250
You know, it's so free.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.899
It's an odd feeling for me.

50:22.811 --> 50:26.566
I feel I could run down
the street naked and nobody would...

50:27.566 --> 50:30.445
You know, it has a really free feeling.

50:31.237 --> 50:32.388
I've never seen it from up here.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.723
I've never really taken
the time to look.

50:34.823 --> 50:38.394
It's so pretty, you know, some of
the stars are beginning to come up.

50:38.494 --> 50:41.043
The fog is just breaking a tiny bit.

50:42.081 --> 50:45.335
You see that very bright
star up in that direction?

50:45.751 --> 50:46.752
Mmm-hmm.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.988
For all we know, that star could have

50:49.088 --> 50:51.115
disappeared a million years ago,

50:51.215 --> 50:55.812
and it's taken the light from it
a million years to reach us.

50:56.514 --> 50:59.558
Oh, so what are you saying?
That star is not there?

50:59.723 --> 51:01.625
That it might not be there.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.170
Even though I can see it
with my own eyes?

51:04.270 --> 51:05.738
That's right.

51:07.147 --> 51:10.384
That's a very, uh,
disquieting thought, you know.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.094
Because when
I see something with my own eyes,

51:12.194 --> 51:14.013
I like to know that it's actually there.

51:14.113 --> 51:16.557
'Cause otherwise, you know,
a person could sit down in a chair

51:16.657 --> 51:17.600
and break his neck.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.186
You know,
you have to be able to rely on things.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.896
That's very, very important.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.439
You know who has
these thoughts all the time?

51:23.539 --> 51:26.901
Schultz the tailor.
He thinks that nothing is real at all

51:27.001 --> 51:30.426
and that everything
exists only in the dream of a dog.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.466
But this is real, isn't it?

51:33.674 --> 51:36.769
And beautiful.
Just think about it for a minute.

51:37.344 --> 51:39.079
Here we are, we're two strangers,

51:39.179 --> 51:41.457
and we're out in the night,
and it's just

51:41.557 --> 51:43.525
so peaceful and quiet.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.921
And suddenly there's,
there's a little clearing in the fog

51:47.021 --> 51:49.865
and we can see right out there
to the stars.

51:50.482 --> 51:53.076
Doesn't this moment just seem perfect?

51:54.403 --> 51:59.099
Yes, but, you know,
it passes so quickly.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.894
Look. Even now the fog
is starting to go back in.

52:01.994 --> 52:03.062
And you know, everything...

52:03.162 --> 52:05.606
Everything's always
moving all the time, you know.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.191
Everything's constantly in motion,

52:07.291 --> 52:10.402
so it's no wonder that I'm nauseous.

52:10.502 --> 52:15.554
My father used to say
"We're all happy, if we only knew it."

52:18.886 --> 52:20.371
Kleinman!

52:20.471 --> 52:22.122
We've been looking all over for you.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.250
I've been wandering around all night
in the fog.

52:24.350 --> 52:26.919
You know, I'm still waiting for Hacker
to tell me what to do.

52:27.019 --> 52:28.191
Hacker's dead.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.297
The killer got Hacker?

52:30.397 --> 52:32.466
Hacker wasn't murdered by the maniac.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.864
Well, who then?

52:35.069 --> 52:36.912
Someone from the other faction.

52:37.279 --> 52:39.098
What other faction?
Since when did we have other factions?

52:39.198 --> 52:41.976
A lot of people have their own ideas
about how to achieve results.

52:42.076 --> 52:43.811
So, naturally, there's tension.

52:43.911 --> 52:45.729
Miller formed his own group.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.690
But so quickly it becomes violent?

52:47.790 --> 52:49.483
Hacker asked for it.

52:49.583 --> 52:51.110
He was stubborn and hot-headed,

52:51.210 --> 52:53.237
despite the fact that
his plan wasn't working.

52:53.337 --> 52:56.490
You sound
like you didn't agree with him either.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.325
I'm with Vogel's group.

52:58.425 --> 53:01.328
Who's Vogel? What's...
Since when is there a third group?

53:01.428 --> 53:03.956
I told you. There's
disagreement on how to handle things.

53:04.056 --> 53:06.292
Yeah, but that's the last thing
in the world we need is disagreement.

53:06.392 --> 53:07.334
You know, we should be pulling...

53:07.434 --> 53:09.436
Don't lecture me, Kleinman!

53:10.270 --> 53:12.214
Are you with us or against us?

53:12.314 --> 53:15.009
I don't know. I don't have
enough facts so I can choose.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.907
Now listen, Kleinman.

53:17.569 --> 53:20.180
Lives are at stake.
You have to make a choice.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.142
You can't threaten him.
Kleinman, don't take this from him.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.351
She's starting already.
Don't get me into...

53:24.451 --> 53:25.394
Who's this?

53:25.494 --> 53:27.605
There you are, Kleinman.
Where the hell have you been?

53:27.705 --> 53:28.856
Where have you been?

53:28.956 --> 53:30.858
For God's sakes,
you wake me in the middle of the night.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.192
Now I hear Hacker's dead.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.986
You wandered off
just when we needed you.

53:34.086 --> 53:36.363
Well, so, you didn't tell me anything.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.782
Kleinman's joined our faction.
From now on he's with us.

53:38.882 --> 53:39.867
Is that true, Kleinman?

53:39.967 --> 53:42.911
No, no. Look, the thing to do,
we have to cooperate.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.622
Are you with them or us?

53:44.722 --> 53:46.749
I don't know. How can I know?

53:46.849 --> 53:48.709
I don't know what the alternatives are.

53:48.809 --> 53:51.629
You know, is one apples, is one pears?

53:51.729 --> 53:53.088
Are they both tangerines?

53:53.188 --> 53:55.049
Let's kill him now
before he gives everything away.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.634
What are you talking...
I don't know anything.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.010
I can't give anything away.

53:58.110 --> 54:01.472
Meanwhile, we're here arguing
and there's an enemy out there killing us.

54:01.572 --> 54:04.266
You know, soon
we're gonna do his killing for him.

54:04.366 --> 54:05.834
The murderer.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.520
He believes he's located
the guilty party.

54:08.620 --> 54:11.190
It's Spiro, the great clairvoyant.

54:11.290 --> 54:13.692
I've heard of him.
He's solved a lot of important cases.

54:13.792 --> 54:16.403
They say all he needs
is something to sniff or feel.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.405
That's right.
He's solved some kidnappings.

54:18.505 --> 54:22.180
Mr. Spiro is on the verge
of revealing the killer.

54:26.805 --> 54:29.274
Mr. Spiro wishes to sniff you.

54:31.185 --> 54:32.232
Me?

54:32.478 --> 54:34.338
Yes.

54:34.438 --> 54:36.315
Well, how come?

54:36.482 --> 54:37.675
It's enough he wishes it.

54:37.775 --> 54:39.927
No! No, don't let him do it.

54:40.027 --> 54:43.931
Hey, wasn't that woman booked on
prostitution charges earlier tonight?

54:44.031 --> 54:44.973
Come on, Kleinman, come on.

54:45.073 --> 54:46.642
I don't wanna,
I don't wanna get sniffed.

54:46.742 --> 54:48.039
- No, I don't want...
- Come on!

54:49.495 --> 54:51.522
I don't wanna be sniffed! No...

54:51.622 --> 54:52.606
Stand still.

54:52.706 --> 54:53.816
Go ahead, sniff away.

54:53.916 --> 54:57.114
This is crazy.
Why should he sniff me? This is...

54:59.755 --> 55:02.383
What is this man sniffing?

55:03.091 --> 55:04.660
It's probably cheese, you know,

55:04.760 --> 55:07.788
'cause tonight was the night
I changed the traps in the bedroom.

55:07.888 --> 55:08.997
Frightened, Kleinman?

55:09.097 --> 55:10.249
No, I'm not frightened.

55:10.349 --> 55:13.669
This is unfair.
Kleinman, stand up for your rights.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.963
I know what he's sniffing.
It's salad dressing.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.172
It's salad dressing. I had...

55:17.272 --> 55:19.800
I spilled salad dressing
on myself this evening.

55:19.900 --> 55:21.719
My landlady cooks for me,

55:21.819 --> 55:24.388
so she made me
a nice salad with a little whitefish.

55:24.488 --> 55:27.141
She makes beautiful whitefish.
I can't have meat...

55:27.241 --> 55:28.434
Shut up!

55:28.534 --> 55:30.978
This man has something in his pocket.

55:31.078 --> 55:32.438
Mr. Spiro has done it again.

55:32.538 --> 55:33.647
What are you talking about?

55:33.747 --> 55:34.857
Look in his pocket.

55:34.957 --> 55:37.526
I have nothing. There's nothing.

55:37.626 --> 55:39.674
Check his inside pocket.

55:41.797 --> 55:44.300
This was stolen from
police headquarters earlier tonight.

55:45.092 --> 55:46.785
This is stolen property.

55:46.885 --> 55:48.871
I carry a glass with me.
I get thirsty, so...

55:48.971 --> 55:51.099
I like to have,
you know, occasionally...

55:51.431 --> 55:52.583
Here! We've trapped him!

55:52.683 --> 55:54.877
Why'd you do it, Kleinman?
You killed the doctor.

55:54.977 --> 55:57.588
Do what? You gonna
believe this guy from smelling me?

55:57.688 --> 56:01.175
Mr. Spiro's uncanny power
has never failed him yet.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.093
Why would I kill the doctor?
Doesn't make sense.

56:03.193 --> 56:06.305
The man took out my gall bladder,
you know. With my consent.

56:06.405 --> 56:08.182
Don't expect him to make sense.

56:08.282 --> 56:10.100
That's how it is with a psychopath.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.478
They can be logical
on every point except one,

56:12.578 --> 56:14.188
their weakness, their point of insanity.

56:14.288 --> 56:15.230
That's right.

56:15.330 --> 56:17.691
And Kleinman's always so damn logical.

56:17.791 --> 56:19.109
This is a joke, isn't it?

56:19.209 --> 56:21.445
Look, look, we're all reasonable,

56:21.545 --> 56:24.031
reasonable, you know,
normal, rational people, right?

56:24.131 --> 56:26.074
Tell me where you got this.
Tell us how you...

56:26.174 --> 56:29.536
Once again
I thank the Lord for the special gift

56:29.636 --> 56:32.039
he has seen fit to bestow on me.

56:32.139 --> 56:34.958
I say we make an example of him.
Who has a rope?

56:35.058 --> 56:38.504
No, you can't do this.
Kleinman, defend yourself.

56:38.604 --> 56:40.047
They're picking on me.
I didn't do anything.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.216
- How do you plead, Kleinman?
- Not guilty.

56:42.316 --> 56:44.468
I plead not guilty.
I never did anything in my life

56:44.568 --> 56:45.719
to deserve any trouble.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.721
If anything, I deserve a bonus.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.801
Come on! Let's get him.

56:50.657 --> 56:51.658
Ahhh!

56:51.867 --> 56:54.165
Where'd he get that pepper?

58:00.352 --> 58:02.229
Let me in. It's me, Max.

58:03.188 --> 58:05.236
- Who is it?
- Max. Max.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.843
Max. Let me in.

58:07.943 --> 58:08.927
Max?

58:09.027 --> 58:11.638
Yes! I have to come in.
They're after me.

58:11.738 --> 58:12.890
Max.

58:12.990 --> 58:15.142
Stop staring at me. I'm not a ghost.

58:15.242 --> 58:16.727
Not yet, although
they're trying to kill me.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.979
- Who?
- There's a mob.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.023
And you dare to come here?

58:21.123 --> 58:23.275
What could I do?
I'm running for my life,

58:23.375 --> 58:26.194
you know,
and I saw your place and, you know, I...

58:26.294 --> 58:29.823
Whatever they think about you,
I'm sure you're guilty of it.

58:29.923 --> 58:33.097
Alma, is it possible
that I could murder somebody?

58:33.593 --> 58:36.563
Alma, I'm asking you a question.
It's me, Max.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.774
I never wanted to lay eyes on you again.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.209
I know. I did a bad thing.

58:41.309 --> 58:43.503
You know, but time heals.
It's been years.

58:43.603 --> 58:46.006
The more I thought about it,
the more I wanted you dead.

58:46.106 --> 58:49.468
Dismembered, cut in little pieces
and thrown to the dogs.

58:49.568 --> 58:52.763
Jesus. You've really given this thing
some very specific thought.

58:52.863 --> 58:56.709
You're the worst scum,
and I won't rest until you fry in hell.

58:57.284 --> 58:59.645
Can I stay here tonight? Is it...

58:59.745 --> 59:02.814
How could you do it? How could you
leave me standing there at the altar

59:02.914 --> 59:06.234
in front of family and friends,
humiliated and weeping?

59:06.334 --> 59:09.196
I've explained that to you.
There's two sides to every story.

59:09.296 --> 59:11.490
What two sides?
Do you deny we were to be married

59:11.590 --> 59:14.201
and you made an idiot of me
in front of everyone?

59:14.301 --> 59:17.475
I was nervous. I was a little drunk.
I was unsure.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.039
Unsure?

59:19.139 --> 59:21.124
It was your idea to get married.

59:21.224 --> 59:23.710
And it was your idea to get me pregnant.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.379
It was a hysterical pregnancy.

59:25.479 --> 59:26.630
You weren't actually pregnant.

59:26.730 --> 59:27.881
So what?

59:27.981 --> 59:30.217
Will you just keep quiet?
I'm trying to hide.

59:30.317 --> 59:31.969
We looked everywhere.

59:32.069 --> 59:35.222
My father, my mother, my brothers.
"Where could he be?"

59:35.322 --> 59:38.558
"He was here before the ceremony.
True, he was drinking."

59:38.658 --> 59:41.286
Listen, I know what you're gonna say.

59:41.411 --> 59:45.065
While everybody's walking around,
puzzled and muttering,

59:45.165 --> 59:49.591
sensing my discomfort,
he's discovered in a broom closet,

59:49.753 --> 59:51.905
making love with my sister.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.741
Jesus. I thought I explained
that to you.

59:54.841 --> 59:57.452
What kind of explanation
could you possibly have?

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.455
You were naked
in the closet with my sister.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.791
Look at her.
She still holds that against me.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.251
It's not that I didn't like you.

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:05.419
I like you, I like you a lot.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:06.962
I just didn't love you.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.046
And I thought you were pregnant.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:09.965
I was trying to do the honorable thing.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:13.635
The honorable thing?
To desert me at the altar

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.221
and make love with my younger sister

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.016
in a broom closet
is the honorable thing?

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.727
Look, we just had
your best interests at heart.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.829
I want you dead, and her.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:25.272
No. Don't say a thing.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.025
She was a wonderful girl.
She's fabulous. She loved you.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.610
She worshipped you like a goddess.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.029
She was singing your praises.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.322
I promise you. Till the moment
I slipped her pants off...

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.449
Get out of here!

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.868
Be careful with that. Be angry with me.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:40.037
All right, all right, fault me.
But not Trudy.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.247
Not Trudy, I beg of you.
Not your sister.

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.750
I convinced her to do it.
She didn't wanna do it.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.126
I promised to get her steaks.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:47.711
Kleinman's here!

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.296
- Here he is!
- Shh!

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:54.134
Kleinman's here!
Get out and die. Get out. Die!

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.303
You rot in hell, you filthy vermin.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:59.330
It's good to see you're not bitter
after all these years.

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:14.212
You whore!

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.156
I'll kill you.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.034
You're the one who should be ashamed.

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:22.329
How could you?
With a student for a few silver coins?

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.998
It wasn't a few silver coins.
He gave me $700.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:27.000
Yes, but you didn't know
what you were doing.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.419
- If you must know, I enjoyed myself.
- I'll kill you.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.089
- No, no, no!
- I hate you!

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.965
I was drunk. I was miserable.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.818
I hate you! I hate you! I'll kill you!

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:39.613
I wish we'd never met. Come home.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.306
I never want to see you again.

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:43.058
- He was young and handsome.
- Get away!

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.142
Yes, he was!

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.394
And you enjoyed yourself?

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.563
Was he a better lover than me?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.315
He treated me romantically.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.693
But he felt nothing.
Just lust, pure lust.

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.028
I don't care to talk about it.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:57.280
Yeah, I'm sure you don't.
Where's the money?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.304
- I gave it to charity.
- You're joking!

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.702
You don't think I'm worth $700?

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:06.272
There isn't a whore
in the world worth $700,

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.275
especially not an amateur whore
like you.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.557
Bastard! You...

01:02:12.657 --> 01:02:14.497
Wait. What's that?

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:16.925
Oh...

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.322
I'm scared.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.032
Don't panic.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.163
Hold me.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.241
I'll protect you.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.327
It is rather scary.

01:02:33.624 --> 01:02:36.335
- Oh, my God! It's gruesome.
- What?

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.720
- Oh, God...
- Be quiet.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.678
Stay there.

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:50.725
Oh...

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:59.526
I hear footsteps.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.762
- Listen.
- No, they're getting fainter.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.890
Quick, we have to get out of here.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.960
Wait. Do you hear something?

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.634
The same woman. The same woman I...

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:21.257
I saw her earlier.
We gave her some money.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:24.317
She... She had a baby with her.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.014
Oh...

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.474
Oh!

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:33.560
Oh!

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.754
It's too horrible to think about.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.527
Is she all right?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.906
Oh, the poor little thing.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.746
We'll have to keep the baby.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.556
What? What are you talking about?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.100
- Well, she has no one.
- What about her father?

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.728
- No... There is none.
- How do you know?

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:52.979
I talked to the woman earlier.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.648
There's no... There's no father.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.984
There's no family. She has no one.
She was all alone.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:03:59.819
But we can't keep a baby.

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.821
What do you want to do,
just leave her in the gutter?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:02.989
No, but...

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.617
But what? She needs parents.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:08.266
- Yes, but...
- Stop yes butting and no butting.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:12.441
I wanted a baby,
now God has dropped one in my lap.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:14.125
We have no money.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.102
But... We do. Come here.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:18.938
Look.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.508
- You just hold her for a second.
- I can't.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.361
Just hold her for a second. Be careful.

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.461
Here, maybe...

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.622
Don't put her on the ground.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.247
Oh...

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.086
Here.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:43.363
Three hundred dollars.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.032
It's not legal. We have
to give her over to an orphanage.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.702
How are they going to treat her
in an orphanage?

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.896
Oh. She needs love and care.

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:53.206
She needs a mother and a father.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.791
It's out of the question.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.543
Well, I'm going to keep her.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:58.086
No, you are...
You're going to put her back

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:01.156
where I found her
and we'll inform the police.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:02.489
- Help!
- Quiet!

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.759
The killer could be lurking.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.328
You don't have to,
but I'm going to raise this baby.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.246
She's so tiny.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.437
She's pretty.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.790
I didn't say she wasn't pretty.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:23.203
This is madness. Madness.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:26.552
She is beautiful.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:31.103
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.354
- I saw him go this way.
- All right, lead on the right.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.090
Kleinman.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.550
Did anybody look down there?

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:47.844
He's gotta be over here.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.471
Or maybe down here.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:51.431
Down here. Try down here.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.975
He must be down here.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.998
Down the stairs.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:17.248
No, I don't want to interrupt anything.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.542
- I just want to rest for a minute.
- You're not interrupting anything.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.711
Oh, come in, come in.
Come in. You're welcome.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.463
It's late. There's no one here but us.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:24.506
I never come... This is not...

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.383
What's your name, sweetheart?

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.301
- Kleinman.
- Well, sit down, Mr. Kleinman.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.719
Let me get you something to drink.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.821
It's late. Jack's one of our regulars.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:36.101
I find this atmosphere
a lot more stimulating than university.

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:39.663
- As long as we do the stimulating.
- That's right.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:43.858
I was just pointing out to these lovely
ladies the metaphors of perversion.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.777
Oh, my goodness, such big words.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.195
Yeah, the chief magistrate likes me

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.656
to tie him up, hand and foot.
He pays me for that.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.157
Exactly my point.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.867
You take away his freedom
and he becomes blissful,

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:55.095
delighted, sexually aroused.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.038
- He's frightened of his freedom.
- Oh...

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:59.499
He's frightened, is he?
What's he frightened of?

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.668
Who knows. Whatever his impulses are.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:05.422
- Aw...
- Power, lust, murder.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:06.506
There are laws against murder.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.734
Haven't you heard about that?

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:11.094
Maybe certain people
obey only their own laws.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.413
Is that what they teach you
at the University, to be superior?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.599
No, no, no, no.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.292
We learn facts.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.145
Nothing but facts.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.122
Logic

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:25.859
and Mathematics
and how to become depressed.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.528
Your problem
is you don't believe in anything.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:30.155
Oh, spoken by a true whore

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.906
who believes only in cash.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:35.306
Better... Better false gods
then no god at all. Hmm?

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.684
Here's a thoughtful looking man.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.024
What are your views on divine matters?

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.335
Excuse me, you... Me?

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.858
I'm asking you if you believe in God.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.800
It's... It's incredible, that's the third
time tonight somebody asked me

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.777
that exact same question.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.095
You know, I would love to.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.930
Believe me, I know
I would be much happier.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.223
Yeah, but you can't.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:58.349
I can't, no. It's just, you know...

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.895
You doubt his existence and you can't
make the leap of faith necessary.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.605
Listen, I can't make the leap of faith

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.523
necessary to believe
in my own existence.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:07.025
Here's your drink, Kleinman.

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.151
That's fine. That's tricky.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.028
You keep making jokes
until the moment comes

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.113
and you've really got to face death.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:14.240
Why are we on such a morbid subject?

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.576
I just, you know...
That's the future, you know.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.660
Oh, is it the future?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.662
No, no, no. The trick
is to have as much wine, as many men,

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.625
as many laughs as you can
until they carry you out in a pine box.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.667
And then don't go easily.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.421
When I go, I want to
die in my sleep without ever knowing.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.756
That's some world when the nicest gift

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:31.341
that you can wish
for someone you really care for

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:32.800
is that they die in their sleep.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.801
If I thought
that there was nothing except this,

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.638
I'd kill myself.

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.389
I've thought of it.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.225
Believe me, there have been many times

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.644
when my brain has said, "Why not?"

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:45.292
I mean, there's no point to anything.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:50.214
But somehow
my blood always said, "Live, live."

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.390
And I always listen to my blood.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.410
How about you, Kleinman?

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:03.872
You know, I know exactly
what I think about all this,

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.292
but I can never find the words
to put it in,

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.502
you know, maybe if I get little
drunk I could dance it for you.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:09.587
And, express myself.

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.130
Come on, honey,
I know what's on your mind.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.608
Come on. Let's go to the bedroom.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.054
I've never paid for sex in my life.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.658
Oh, you just think you haven't.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.285
Enjoy yourself, Kleinman.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.711
May all your ups and downs be in bed.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.255
You're in a peculiar mood.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.736
That little circus performer.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.805
You still haven't
gotten her out of your mind.

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.929
Isn't that odd?

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:42.095
A moment's chance encounter,

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.566
a business transaction
with a total stranger.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.772
I mean, we barely spoke.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.277
And yet tonight
I feel like I've lost something.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.369
I'm so sorry.
This never happened to me before.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.934
I never have any problem.
It's so humiliating. I just...

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.769
What's the matter, honey?
Don't you like me?

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.854
- No, it isn't that.
- Huh? Don't you?

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:10.106
I'm sure it's that
conversation we were having downstairs.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.025
Maybe we should try a new position, huh?

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.860
No, hey, believe me,
it isn't the position.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.778
You know, I've used
this position before,

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.948
many times, and it has always
worked very effectively for me.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.419
You know, sometimes
within a matter of seconds...

01:10:21.519 --> 01:10:24.612
Kleinman, some men are looking for you.
We can't have any trouble here.

01:10:25.079 --> 01:10:28.182
- Is there another way out?
- The roof. Hurry.

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:41.721
What was that?

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.198
Behind here.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:45.200
Down there.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.840
Simon Carr. What are you doing here?

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.167
I'm part of Nagel's plan.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.945
Nagel has a plan, too?
Everybody has a plan.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:00.448
I'm the only one in town
that doesn't know what he's doing.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:01.699
By the way, Kleinman,

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.993
I ran into Mr. Paulsen before, uh,

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.516
he's, uh, giving me the promotion.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.515
He said that?

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:13.152
Actually, he said
that sees you as a kind of

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:17.715
cringing, slimy vermin,
more suited to extermination

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.817
than life on this planet.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:22.428
I don't think he means it personally.

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.265
Carr, did you happen to see

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:29.915
a young woman with
a big hat and a valise wandering around?

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.438
Yes, I did, with a man and a child.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.211
A man and a child?

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.319
Yes, they were out by the bridge,
toward the circus.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:41.389
Cringing, slimy vermin...

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.635
- Come on. Hurry up with that milk.
- I'm coming.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.137
She's gonna fall asleep.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:07.411
- Don't overfeed her.
- I'm not going to overfeed her.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:08.891
Okay, now this is warm.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.743
She's so beautiful.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:13.521
- Look at her eyes.
- I know.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:15.898
Be careful. Her fingers are very tiny.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.734
I'm careful. I'm very careful.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.653
- Now she's asleep. She won't drink this.
- Yes. Look, she smiled at me.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.506
- Oh, look.
- Did you see that? She smiled.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.492
- She's the future.
- Yeah.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:27.827
You're the future.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:29.287
I want her to go to school.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:31.998
I don't want her to be
a traveling gypsy like us.

01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:34.876
I just want to hold her for a minute.
Can I hold her for a second?

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.711
- No, you better... No.
- I won't wake her up.

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.379
No, because you squeeze too hard.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:39.714
- No. No.
- I don't squeeze hard.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.215
- No. No.
- Come on, please.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:43.509
- Just let's feed her.
- No I want to hold her.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.949
- Listen, no.
- Please.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:51.709
- We'll have another baby instead.
- Another baby?

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:55.129
Yeah. I don't want her to grow up alone.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:56.856
- It's not good to grow up alone.
- Oh...

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.357
She'll be too lonely.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.800
Wonderful.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.293
Irmy, look out!
Look out, it's the killer.

01:14:04.393 --> 01:14:05.675
- It's the killer.
- Kleinman?

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.844
Yes, I'm here! Run! Run! Run!

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:11.039
- What about you?
- Don't worry! I'll take care of...

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.975
Don't come near her.
Don't come near her. Run! Run!

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.059
What about you?

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.353
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.205
Don't come near me.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:50.866
Good evening.
I am Almstead, the magician.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.098
Almstead! My God.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.517
I do some tricks myself.
I'm an amateur magician.

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:58.227
So you're my idol.
I came to the... Just to see you.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:01.922
I was just celebrating
our closing performance.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:06.652
And, also, of course, packing up
my illusions and my paraphernalia.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:08.529
The killer is loose. You have to stop.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.427
- The killer is loose.
- Oh...

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.325
- The evil one.
- Yes.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:14.848
Yes, roaming. There he is.

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.475
Think of something. Think quick!

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.418
Come! Come! Over here! Quickly! Come!

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.442
- What?
- My mirror illusion. Come.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.402
You must help. Come.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:30.284
Yes, come.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.287
Alley-whoop!

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:38.100
Come, come, young man.
Jump into the mirror.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.453
Come. The evil one comes.

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.289
Just jump. Jump.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.298
Jump.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.255
We got him. We got him.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.483
We have captured the beast.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.009
Yes, we got him.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.260
- Yes.
- We got him.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.387
Fantastic. He was right...
He was right...

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.785
Yes, he was here. Now he's there.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:01.017
- Come on everybody.
- Yes, come, come.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.226
We got him.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:03.269
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:04.770
Almstead got him.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:07.440
He is over there. Bound in the chains.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.885
- Where is he?
- Over there. Bound hand and foot in...

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.888
Where did he go?

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.574
Where is he? What are you talking about?

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.576
- He was right here. He was...
- I'm amazed.

01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:21.162
Kleinman saw him. He was here.

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.413
Yes I did. He was right over here.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:25.332
No man could have escaped from...

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:29.003
Look, look.
You see here, these are real locks.

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.071
- Yes we had him.
- Almstead, you drink too much.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:34.091
- No, he was...
- I tell you he was here. We had the killer.

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.134
Search the building.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:38.078
Looks like he's a better
magician than you.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:43.208
I'm so tired.
I can't even think straight.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.253
- I can imagine.
- I want to go to sleep.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.359
- We definitely had him. Believe me.
- Yes.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.487
- Ask him.
- Even I could not have escaped.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:57.466
All I know is you certainly
saved my life.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:58.783
You were very brave.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:17:59.909
Well, I can be brave, you know?

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:00.993
You were.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:02.620
It's just that I can't think
about it first, you know.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.081
If I ever think about
what's going to happen to me,

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.604
then I lose control of my muscles.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.921
Well, I guess this is goodbye, you know.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.319
We're going to be
pulling out in a few hours.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.259
- It's been a strange night hasn't it?
- Oh...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.637
I feel like my whole life has changed.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:22.786
Me too. Very, very unusual.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:25.184
So are you going to be okay?

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:29.647
I should be all right you know, apart from
the fact that I'm wanted by a lynch mob,

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.982
and the police are after me
and there's a homicidal maniac loose,

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.568
and I'm unemployed,
you know, everything else is fine.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:36.237
What are you going to do?

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:37.839
Mr. Kleinman.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:41.200
You know that I'm looking
for an assistant?

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.243
You are?

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.328
Yes, you said that you knew
all of my tricks, huh?

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:47.398
Yes, I'm an amateur magician.
I'm an amateur.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:51.627
As a matter of fact, I can do a little thing
here that you might appreciate.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.130
This is... You know...
I'm not as good as I once...

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.297
Wait, wait, wait. Because I'm nervous.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.341
Because it's almost... Oh, wait.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.553
Well, that is a beginning.
Hey, yes. Of course it is.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:05.454
Now, at any rate, you know,
you assisted Almstead at a critical time.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:10.062
I am still bewildered
by his miraculous escape.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:12.398
My theory is
we did something to deserve all this.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:13.858
Oh, that's crazy.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.776
Theories, that's all I hear all night.
Theories and questions.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.069
What's your theory?

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.780
My theory is that nothing good is going
to happen until we catch him.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.741
So, Mr. Kleinman, do you wish
to assist the great Almstead?

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:26.412
Watch this. I would love to, believe me,
but I, you know, can't just run away

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:27.454
and join the circus.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.707
Oh, just what's wrong with the circus?

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:33.460
You travel, you drink.
There's beautiful women.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.880
I can't. You know what,
I'm going to join the circus.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.424
That's crazy.
You know, I have to go back to town

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.926
and, you know, join real life.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:42.386
Like what? What?

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:46.348
What do you mean, like what?
You know, what kind of question is that?

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.684
I could marry my landlady
and run a boarding house.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.708
Oh, yes, yes, yes. The gray hat.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:56.550
Sooner or later we all must put on
the gray hat of compromise.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:58.652
No, I'm, you know...

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.255
Believe me, I'm flattered
by your offer but I, you know...

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:06.160
At heart I'm a clerk you know, I'm an
ink-stained wretch is what it is in the end.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:10.231
So you do not wish to apprentice with
the immortal Almstead, eh?

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.459
Hmm. Well, you know, they
come from all over to see Almstead

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.044
even the crowned heads.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:19.570
I once produced a rabbit from between
the bosoms of the Queen of Denmark.

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:23.911
A small rabbit. Small bosoms.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:31.828
How could I work for the circus?
You know, it's crazy.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:36.753
Although I must say,
to be Almstead's assistant would be...

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:41.762
It's crazy, it's just a dream.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:46.426
I don't know if we're going to be
passing through this way again.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.625
- Good luck.
- You take care of yourself.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:56.443
- You, too.
- Thank you.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.018
Huh.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:16.855
Imagine turning down
an opportunity to work with a legend

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:18.190
in the show business.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.025
Meanwhile, your tricks
didn't stop the killer.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:24.972
No, no, but we checked his reins for a
moment, perhaps we even frightened him.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:30.428
Look. Look what he has done
to my mirror.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:35.144
Well, I had better pack up
my paraphernalia.

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:36.767
Almstead.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.295
I've decided to accept your offer.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.879
Congratulations.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.090
Of course, the pay is very low.

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.217
That's okay. I don't need much money.
You just give me...

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:46.635
Very, very low pay.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.595
I understand that, but it's no problem.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.764
Perhaps even lower than you might think.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.559
I don't care. This is going
to be the first time in my life

01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:56.186
that I can actually
do something that I really love.

01:21:56.286 --> 01:22:01.734
Love? Just make sure that love does
not interfere with your duties.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.569
No. Don't worry, my duties come first.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.239
What better way to spend
the rest of my life than to help you with

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.491
all those wonderful illusions of yours.

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.435
It's true.
Everybody loves his illusions.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.180
Loves them.

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:21.021
They need them like they need the air.

01:22:22.305 --> 01:22:28.868
