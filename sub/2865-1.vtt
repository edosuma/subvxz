00:50.300 --> 00:52.179
- Time's up.
- Wait.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.179
Is the truck loaded?

00:53.180 --> 00:54.819
Yes, ma'am.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.819
Come on. I got a plane to catch.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.579
Well, if you don't leave now
you're going to miss your flight

00:58.580 --> 01:01.084
and then he's going to
be late for school.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.691
Come on. Come on. Game's up.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.406
Come on!

01:06.580 --> 01:08.179
You got three days left to counter.

01:08.180 --> 01:08.779
Wait.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.739
You have to wait, you!

01:11.740 --> 01:14.688
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.921
Hey.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.179
Your grand-dad gave me that.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.459
I always use it when I travel.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.930
Can I have it when you get back?

01:28.220 --> 01:30.360
Yeah, man.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.739
And we'll finish the game, okay?

01:34.740 --> 01:37.404
Don't re-set it.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.939
Okay. Ask Grandpa when he's
going to come and visit.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.521
I will. I got to go.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.299
I love you.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.819
Okay. I got to get...

01:48.820 --> 01:51.939
Got to go, got to go.
Call me when you land.

01:51.940 --> 01:55.681
Will do. I love you.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.366
I love you, too.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.059
You okay?

02:00.060 --> 02:02.121
Yeah.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.059
Okay. See you on Friday.

02:10.060 --> 02:12.121
Yeah.

02:12.660 --> 02:15.487
- Say hi to dad.
- Will do.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.619
Come on Honey.

02:24.620 --> 02:28.888
Got to go. Got to go.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.379
Morning, kiddo.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.247
Yo.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.019
You heard from daddy this morning?

02:49.020 --> 02:51.001
No.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.859
Still thinking?

02:52.860 --> 02:53.699
Yeah.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.619
I got to move, but I think I
can check mate him in three.

02:56.620 --> 02:58.059
Oh, yeah?

02:58.060 --> 02:59.339
Yeah.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.939
What's the move?

03:00.940 --> 03:04.969
First move pawn five to pawn three.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.979
What is it?

03:16.980 --> 03:18.739
You okay?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.005
Hi, Mrs. Whyte.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.286
Hey Grace.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.219
Hey.

03:24.220 --> 03:25.659
Did you grab the brownies I made?

03:25.660 --> 03:26.779
Yeah.

03:26.780 --> 03:27.979
Have a good day.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.927
You too.

03:43.740 --> 03:45.539
Hi. Leave a message.

03:45.540 --> 03:46.979
Hey, it's me.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.859
Haven't heard from
you since yesterday.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.539
Hope the conference is going well.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.179
We're going to see you tonight.

03:54.180 --> 04:02.009
And making something special for
supper, so come home hungry.

04:02.260 --> 04:05.322
Love you. Bye.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.219
Look what I made.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.499
It can go light speed
fast by forming a portal

04:14.500 --> 04:15.739
through these generators.

04:15.740 --> 04:19.579
One creates negative energy and
the other one creates positive.

04:19.579 --> 04:21.459
That's nice.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.819
Look. And there's room
for the both of us.

04:23.820 --> 04:26.051
Let me see.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.459
What's that?

04:28.460 --> 04:32.523
For when they have a baby, but
they don't make Lego babies yet.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.419
Um...

04:38.420 --> 04:41.259
ls there milk in it?

04:41.260 --> 04:43.059
Yeah.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.459
Jere, you want a brownie?

04:44.460 --> 04:46.725
Yes.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.339
You're not having any?

04:50.340 --> 04:52.765
Not if you aren't.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.059
Hey. It's me.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.579
We've been waiting for an hour.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.164
Call me when you get this.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.811
Bye.

05:35.780 --> 05:38.419
Flight 767 from Newark,

05:38.420 --> 05:41.019
have all the passengers
come off the flight yet?

05:41.020 --> 05:44.161
Uh... Yeah.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.699
Maintenance crews are on board.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.299
We've been here for over an hour,

05:48.300 --> 05:51.219
My husband's on that flight
and he hasn't come out yet.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.939
Maybe he's stuck in customs.

05:53.940 --> 05:55.899
This happens all the time.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.299
Unfortunately, there's nothing
we can really do from here.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.659
Okay.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.607
Thank you.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.539
Is he here?

06:08.540 --> 06:12.569
No. Not yet, kiddo.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.259
Empire Place.

06:28.260 --> 06:28.779
Hi.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.099
I'd like to enquire about
a client who's there

06:31.100 --> 06:33.699
for the Relativistic
Dynamics conference.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.419
His name's Gabriel Whyte.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.979
W-h-y-t-e.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.739
Yes, ma'am.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.927
Can you tell me what
time he checked out?

06:44.460 --> 06:47.761
Mr. Whyte is still checked in.

06:49.860 --> 06:50.979
He is?

06:50.980 --> 06:53.179
I'm dialling through.
There's no answer.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.779
Would you do me a favour
and send somebody

06:55.780 --> 06:59.081
to check that he's not there?

06:59.380 --> 07:00.659
He was supposed to be
on a flight tonight

07:00.660 --> 07:03.739
and I'm waiting for him at
the airport in Toronto.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.379
Sure, I'll have someone
go to his room.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.619
Shall I put you on hold?

07:06.620 --> 07:09.602
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.059
What happened?

07:15.060 --> 07:17.179
Not sure. Daddy's late.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.139
Housekeeping checked his room.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.883
He's not there but his luggage is.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.579
And he hasn't left any messages?

07:24.580 --> 07:26.891
No ma'am.

07:31.940 --> 07:32.659
Hello?

07:32.660 --> 07:33.779
Hey, Dad...

07:33.780 --> 07:34.979
Oh hi, sweetie.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.939
Have you seen Gabe the
last couple of days?

07:37.940 --> 07:42.579
'Cause I'm at Pearson and he was supposed
to come off the flight and he hasn't.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.819
So I called the hotel and they
said that he's still checked in.

07:44.820 --> 07:49.859
- But his phone's turned off and...
- I saw him right after he landed.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.699
I took him to a work
space on campus

07:51.700 --> 07:53.379
and just left him.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.339
We were supposed to have
lunch the next day,

07:55.340 --> 07:57.499
but he didn't answer his phone
so I figured he was busy.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.739
Something's wrong.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.059
He called me yesterday morning

08:00.060 --> 08:01.619
and I haven't heard from him since.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.179
Okay. I'll... I'll...

08:03.180 --> 08:05.499
I'll see what I can find out
and I'll call you back.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.659
Okay.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.019
Tell Grandpa I said hi.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.699
- Okay, I heard him.
- Hi, Erol.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.779
He says hi.

08:11.780 --> 08:13.179
- Bye, Dad.
- Thank you.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.889
- Okay.
- Good bye.

08:31.060 --> 08:35.179
Gabriel Whyte. Newark.

08:35.179 --> 08:38.419
He left Wednesday morning.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.058
- No.
- I haven't spoken to him to date.

08:40.059 --> 08:43.379
The last time anyone spoke to
him was my father in Princeton.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.019
Look, you're the police.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.446
Aren't you supposed to
be doing something?

09:13.660 --> 09:15.299
Hey, Joanne, it's me.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.099
Hi.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.059
Can I ask you a huge favour?

09:19.060 --> 09:23.404
Would you watch Erol for a couple of
days for me while I go to Princeton?

09:26.540 --> 09:28.459
He called after landing,
checked into his hotel,

09:28.460 --> 09:31.681
came to my office,
then we came here.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.619
Well, have the police
been here yet?

09:33.620 --> 09:34.259
Not yet.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.899
I didn't even know
this place existed.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.139
He's the one who showed it to me.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.939
I just gave him access and left.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.683
He said he wanted a
quiet place to work.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.979
This definitely was not here.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.929
Whatever it is, it must be his.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.099
Did he have those crates with him?

09:51.100 --> 09:53.729
Shrink-wrapped, yeah.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.800
Dad...

10:29.820 --> 10:32.051
Yeah?

10:35.220 --> 10:37.819
It's his wallet and his phone.

10:37.820 --> 10:40.927
We need to get the
police here right away.

10:41.340 --> 10:46.131
I want to maybe talk to people
that he knew on campus.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.484
I don't know what to do.

11:18.860 --> 11:20.059
Hey, Professor.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.699
I pulled those boxes we were talking about.
Just let me know where you want them.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.219
Okay. I'll catch up with you.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.539
I need to get back.

11:25.540 --> 11:29.099
Listen, we'll find him.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.684
Dad, it's been three days.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.379
The police are baffled and...

11:34.380 --> 11:38.966
Marika, we'll figure it out.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.527
Thanks, Dad.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.299
Call me later.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.201
Bye.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.099
Hi.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.240
Hi.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.659
This place hasn't changed.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.259
Yeah, it's my grand-dad's legacy.

12:10.260 --> 12:11.739
We've kept it exactly
how he made it.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.019
You want a coffee?

12:13.020 --> 12:15.251
Uh, yeah.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.219
Um, can I ask you a question?

12:19.220 --> 12:21.167
Sure.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.126
Sorry.

12:26.100 --> 12:31.099
You haven't seen this guy in
here in the past couple of days?

12:31.100 --> 12:35.925
Uh... No. Sorry.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.285
Yes, coming right up.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.379
Is that your report card?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.339
Dad!

13:18.340 --> 13:19.979
Hey, peanut.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.325
Give us a look.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.765
Can I see yours?

13:34.180 --> 13:36.570
Yeah, all right.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.579
Why were you away so much?

13:45.580 --> 13:48.084
Because I never came home.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.441
Erol?

14:03.500 --> 14:04.859
You okay?

14:04.860 --> 14:07.444
Yes. Strange dream.

14:11.660 --> 14:14.299
This is Marika. Please
leave a message.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.779
Hey, Mom. I'm just checking in.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.259
Hope the lecture went well.
Have a safe flight.

14:19.260 --> 14:21.366
Bye.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.859
Was it about your mom?

14:26.860 --> 14:29.888
No, I just forgot to
call her earlier.

14:30.380 --> 14:33.806
Was it about how you haven't
studied for your finals?

14:33.900 --> 14:37.371
No need to dream about reality.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.445
Mom?

15:41.700 --> 15:42.819
Mom?

15:42.820 --> 15:43.819
Yeah?

15:43.820 --> 15:46.099
Hey. Welcome back.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.299
You just get in?

15:47.300 --> 15:48.979
Yeah.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.499
Want breakfast?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.243
Thanks. That would be great.

15:53.740 --> 15:55.259
Right. Come down whenever.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.241
Okay.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.979
Morning, kiddo.

16:11.980 --> 16:14.405
Hey. Good morning.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.459
Oh, thank you.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.488
Didn't you have class today?

16:21.500 --> 16:24.448
I cancelled. I was too tired.

16:24.580 --> 16:26.979
Didn't sleep on the plane?

16:26.980 --> 16:29.245
Not much lately.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.739
There's another
letter here from MIT.

16:32.740 --> 16:34.059
Have you accepted yet?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.939
Told you, I'm just
not a Red Sox fan.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.299
Oh, honey.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.659
You can't let this go by.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.005
We'll talk about this later.

16:44.340 --> 16:47.779
By the way, there's a message from
Dr. Wong's office on the machine.

16:47.780 --> 16:51.059
- Did you miss your appointment last week?
- I'm not seeing Dr. Wong anymore.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.699
Why not?

16:52.700 --> 16:57.339
Because I never blacked out
once from the medication

16:57.340 --> 17:02.131
but he is keeping my
driver's license.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.779
And I'm sick of taking the bus.

17:05.780 --> 17:08.887
So you want to change medications?

17:09.020 --> 17:12.207
Well, I'd like to stop altogether.

17:12.819 --> 17:15.219
As in, you've already stopped?

17:15.220 --> 17:17.166
Yep.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.887
I'd like to feel like myself again.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.739
You're not eating?

17:25.740 --> 17:26.419
No.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.739
I already did.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.299
Let's talk about this later, okay?

17:29.300 --> 17:30.419
Bye.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.299
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.939
Bye. Have a good day.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.001
You too.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.760
Okay.

18:10.780 --> 18:11.979
Anyone.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.939
It would take weeks to
even organize a work flow.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.779
What if I gave you my approach?

18:18.780 --> 18:19.699
Did it work?

18:19.700 --> 18:22.204
No, no. You have to tell me.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.099
Oh, Mr. Whyte.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.539
Only two minutes left.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.139
Why even bother?

18:28.140 --> 18:28.779
Sorry, sir.

18:28.780 --> 18:32.619
Well, since you obviously
don't need my instruction,

18:32.620 --> 18:35.443
why don't you tell us the answer?

18:38.460 --> 18:39.459
It... it's unsolvable.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.139
You have one too many variables.

18:41.140 --> 18:44.202
We need to know the
value of Z at least.

18:46.780 --> 18:47.899
Okay.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.579
That's good for today.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.369
Mr. Whyte. Can I have a word?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.539
I'm listening.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.459
I'm sorry.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.459
What was so important this time?

19:14.460 --> 19:17.019
Is this Grandpa Sal
asking, or Professor Sal?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.779
Uh, both.

19:18.780 --> 19:19.979
I was helping Grace.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.689
She has her thesis
defense coming up.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.539
Sometimes I feel like you're
taking advantage of your sweet,

19:25.540 --> 19:26.539
good-natured grandfather.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.608
- Don't give me any special treatment.
- I... I'm not sure how to treat you.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.819
You spend all your time
with your girlfriend.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.619
You never hand in assignments,
half the time you don't even

19:34.620 --> 19:39.379
show up And yet you ace
every one of my exams.

19:39.380 --> 19:42.219
How did you see the problem
on the board so quickly?

19:42.220 --> 19:44.859
- Just did.
- Well, how?

19:44.860 --> 19:46.339
I don't know how.

19:46.340 --> 19:49.379
I can see it like a
colour out of place.

19:49.380 --> 19:53.443
You need to know Z
otherwise it's a dead end.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.499
What about this?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.765
Can you do it?

20:03.460 --> 20:06.299
Yeah. Yeah, I can do this.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.659
I'm going to need a few hours.

20:08.660 --> 20:09.299
Great.

20:09.300 --> 20:12.419
It took me a week.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.926
And I'll bet you come up
with the same answer.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.819
Erol, can I show you something?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.484
It's in the lab.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.604
You need a maid, Grandpa?

20:31.140 --> 20:33.166
Okay.

20:35.420 --> 20:39.419
All right, look, I need you
to listen very carefully

20:39.420 --> 20:40.939
to what I'm going to say.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.779
I...

20:41.780 --> 20:43.899
I need you to be open to
the craziest possibilities.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.619
Things you dreamed of as a child.

20:46.620 --> 20:52.619
There are multiple universes
and we live in one of them,

20:52.620 --> 20:57.539
one track, at one
point in space time.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.419
Now, before your father
left for Princeton...

20:59.420 --> 21:00.219
My father?

21:00.220 --> 21:00.899
Just listen.

21:00.900 --> 21:06.459
Before he left I believe
he found a way to move

21:06.460 --> 21:10.619
back and forth on that track.

21:10.620 --> 21:11.459
What?

21:11.460 --> 21:13.899
He stabilized a
traversable wormhole,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.699
moved the accelerated
end of that wormhole

21:16.700 --> 21:22.208
into the past and
travelled through it.

21:26.780 --> 21:27.659
It's an accelerator.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.179
I found it in one of those
boxes in the storage room

21:30.180 --> 21:30.819
at Princeton.

21:30.820 --> 21:35.008
They were sitting there for
54 years when I found them.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.659
This display had the
last coordinates

21:38.660 --> 21:41.939
where I believe your father
arrived, stored in its memory.

21:41.940 --> 21:47.899
GPS coordinates of exactly where
I found it minus 19,655 days

21:47.900 --> 21:50.859
from when I found it.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.619
I've... I've been trying to
make this work for years

21:52.620 --> 21:54.659
but there were missing
parts and I... I...

21:54.660 --> 21:56.699
- I don't have all your father's notes.
- You're saying that my father...

21:56.700 --> 22:01.605
I'm saying your father
flew to Princeton...

22:02.060 --> 22:09.059
put this together and went back
to the calendar year 1946.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.539
Something must have
happened to him there

22:10.540 --> 22:12.619
otherwise he would have returned
the instant he left and...

22:12.620 --> 22:14.939
and we wouldn't have even
perceived his absence.

22:14.940 --> 22:16.139
What happened to him?

22:16.140 --> 22:17.979
I don't know.

22:17.980 --> 22:20.019
How... how... how could
this be possible?

22:20.020 --> 22:22.739
If I knew that exactly, I'd
have fixed this years ago.

22:22.740 --> 22:25.859
But I'm not a specialist
in quantum mechanics.

22:25.860 --> 22:29.179
I've had to learn about black
holes and cosmic strings

22:29.180 --> 22:31.899
from scratch and I
still can't solve

22:31.900 --> 22:33.699
some of these fundamental problems.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.379
It says he created
negative energy, but I...

22:36.380 --> 22:37.979
I have no idea how.

22:37.980 --> 22:40.484
Why are you telling me this now?

22:45.100 --> 22:47.445
What is this?

22:51.220 --> 22:53.339
You have a gift, Erol.

22:53.340 --> 22:55.939
More so, than your father even.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.059
I didn't want to have
to ever tell you this,

22:58.060 --> 23:00.739
I'd have much preferred
you just live your life.

23:00.740 --> 23:02.499
I can't do this alone.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.739
If you help me I think
we can figure it out.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.219
There is no proof.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.406
There is proof.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.299
These were in one of the boxes.

23:17.300 --> 23:20.579
If you want to test this against your
father's handwriting, be my guest.

23:20.580 --> 23:22.179
This mold, the... the ink...

23:22.180 --> 23:24.099
it's 67 years old.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.099
And I've transcribed all of
your father's research notes.

23:26.100 --> 23:26.899
It's... it's...

23:26.900 --> 23:28.899
it's revolutionary,
never been done before.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.529
And... and look at this!

23:36.340 --> 23:39.099
I think he was planning
to meet with Einstein.

23:39.100 --> 23:43.499
I... I know I'm asking a lot,
but the pay-off, Erol,

23:43.500 --> 23:44.899
everything will be corrected.

23:44.900 --> 23:49.859
- What do you mean "corrected"?
- I mean, we're living in a negative space.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.339
Gabe should be here now.

23:52.340 --> 23:57.484
Your mother, you, me, none of
us should be living this life.

24:00.740 --> 24:04.619
Gabe disappeared in 2000.

24:04.620 --> 24:07.619
Anyone who was affected
by that is living.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.139
An alternate reality.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.219
We fix this, we bring him back.

24:12.220 --> 24:13.979
It'll all return to normal.

24:13.980 --> 24:17.819
The last 12 years of
our lives will go back

24:17.820 --> 24:20.290
to what they were supposed to be.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.659
You really believe this?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.579
Yes.

24:23.580 --> 24:28.499
Grandpa, you know how much mom
struggles forgetting about him.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.731
This is a fantasy.

24:32.980 --> 24:34.499
Have you told any of this to her?

24:34.500 --> 24:37.243
No. I've only told you.

24:38.780 --> 24:41.842
I'm... I'm begging you
to keep it that way.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.081
Erol...

25:06.260 --> 25:09.083
You'll probably never
forgive yourself.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.459
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.771
It's okay. I just got here.

25:16.100 --> 25:17.899
You okay?

25:17.900 --> 25:20.059
Yeah. Did you talk to your Prof?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.299
Presenting in two weeks.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.699
Oh well, I'll... I'll help.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.299
No, you've... you've done enough.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.059
Just show up to the presentation.
I need a friendly face there.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.371
Yeah, I'll be there.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.419
We still on for tonight?

25:31.420 --> 25:34.059
Yeah, if you want. You
seem kind of preoccupied.

25:34.060 --> 25:38.219
No. No. I really had my
heart set on seeing...

25:38.220 --> 25:39.579
what was it again?

25:39.580 --> 25:41.179
A one-man show about
the Bhopal disaster.

25:41.180 --> 25:44.481
Yes. Yes. Exactly
what I wanted to see.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.459
Hi.

25:47.460 --> 25:50.779
Hi. So... you want to
tell me what's up?

25:50.780 --> 25:53.489
No. Tell me... tell me
what research you did.

25:55.060 --> 25:58.459
Mostly just the details on the GNHs
of the three countries I'm studying.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.362
Since it's a theoretical
model, the data has...

26:03.980 --> 26:06.579
So what are you working
on now, Professor?

26:06.580 --> 26:10.059
I take an old family photograph

26:10.060 --> 26:12.419
and I paint a picture
of that image.

26:12.420 --> 26:16.699
And then I make digital copies
of it over and over again,

26:16.700 --> 26:20.019
each time removing elements to it.

26:20.020 --> 26:23.099
And then I... I go back
to the original painting

26:23.100 --> 26:26.899
and take the figures out
as if they weren't there

26:26.900 --> 26:28.499
to begin with.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.899
So you're altering your
own memory sources.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.689
Something like that, yeah.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.539
Hi, honey.

26:35.540 --> 26:36.419
Hello.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.539
Do you want to join us?

26:37.540 --> 26:39.659
That's all right.
I got to get somewhere.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.259
Here, let me take these for you.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.459
You still going?

26:42.460 --> 26:44.619
Yeah, in a second.

26:44.620 --> 26:45.379
Thanks, honey.

26:45.380 --> 26:48.169
Excuse me for one minute.

26:49.980 --> 26:53.690
Would you mind if I checked
out your work station?

26:55.300 --> 26:58.202
You don't have to say
anything, just listen.

26:58.260 --> 27:01.686
I've spent years on this.

27:01.980 --> 27:03.779
Everything I've done
is based on evidence

27:03.780 --> 27:05.819
your father left behind.

27:05.820 --> 27:08.722
Let me walk you
through his research.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.011
Who's this?

27:20.660 --> 27:23.005
My husband.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.179
Is he...?

27:24.180 --> 27:26.411
He's dead.

27:27.620 --> 27:30.090
We should get going.

27:32.060 --> 27:36.169
Just think about what
I've been saying, please.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.921
Thank you, Professor.

27:40.020 --> 27:40.699
Good night.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.090
Thank you for coming.

27:56.340 --> 27:59.322
They admire you so much.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.859
I remember when you dreamed
of becoming an artist.

28:02.860 --> 28:05.091
Now you're doing it.

28:05.420 --> 28:08.288
That wasn't my dream, Pops.

28:09.940 --> 28:10.979
You okay?

28:10.980 --> 28:13.006
Yeah. Why?

28:13.220 --> 28:15.531
You seem distant.

28:16.860 --> 28:21.219
Just, you know, been
away these three days.

28:21.220 --> 28:28.446
Marika, you work too hard.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.645
Thanks for dinner.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.219
It was takeout.

28:34.220 --> 28:37.566
Yeah, but it was really
delicious takeout.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.219
Erol, see you in class?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.259
Yeah.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.321
Good night.

28:56.940 --> 28:59.419
Okay, I'll be late.

28:59.420 --> 29:01.739
Do you ever think about your dad?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.766
What?

29:04.500 --> 29:07.050
We never talk about him.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.339
We don't have to talk about him.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.571
Please.

29:12.980 --> 29:15.370
I'd like to.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.939
Did Gramps say something
to you tonight?

29:19.940 --> 29:22.205
About what?

29:22.340 --> 29:24.366
Nothing.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.890
So you've been thinking
about dad a lot.

29:28.340 --> 29:30.401
Yeah.

29:32.460 --> 29:35.283
It all came flooding back...

29:36.100 --> 29:38.411
at the airport.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.723
I remember we played chess.

29:47.140 --> 29:50.008
Went to the movies twice a month.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.099
On... on science nights
he'd teach me the concepts

29:56.100 --> 29:58.570
using my toys.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.771
He loved me.

30:02.020 --> 30:04.499
It's weird, but I...

30:04.500 --> 30:09.086
I don't remember what he
looked like, you know,

30:09.220 --> 30:12.248
just photographs and stuff.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.401
Do you ever get angry
about what happened?

30:18.620 --> 30:21.568
Mom, I don't think about it.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.641
Did I ever tell you how we met?

30:27.740 --> 30:29.259
No, not really.

30:29.260 --> 30:35.139
You know, it was when we were
still living in Princeton

30:35.140 --> 30:40.619
and pops dragged me to some event

30:40.620 --> 30:42.779
that I didn't want to go to.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.219
I think...

30:44.220 --> 30:48.602
I think mom had just died,
like a couple of months before

30:49.540 --> 30:52.647
and he wanted to get
me out of the house.

30:53.220 --> 30:59.968
Well, he introduced me
to his prize student.

31:02.100 --> 31:05.699
It was love at first
sight, just like

31:05.700 --> 31:08.648
when mom and dad got married.

31:10.900 --> 31:15.579
And he asked me to marry him
a month later at this old diner

31:15.580 --> 31:17.891
we used to go to.

31:19.580 --> 31:24.299
I resisted at first 'cause
he was a workaholic

31:24.300 --> 31:27.487
and wanted to change the world.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.419
I thought he wouldn't
have time for a family.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.019
But you know what he said?

31:36.020 --> 31:36.979
What?

31:36.980 --> 31:41.299
He could change the world and
be home for supper every night.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.884
And he was.

31:45.540 --> 31:48.779
He was so confident.

31:48.780 --> 31:51.379
Do you remember?

31:51.380 --> 31:52.779
Yeah.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.523
Such a dreamer.

31:56.820 --> 31:59.768
Nothing was impossible.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.059
You know, I have this recurring
dream about the night

32:08.060 --> 32:10.779
that he didn't come home,

32:10.780 --> 32:14.286
where he calls and tells
me what happened.

32:15.540 --> 32:18.283
What happened?

32:18.340 --> 32:20.446
Well...

32:22.660 --> 32:25.289
he fell in love.

32:25.780 --> 32:32.403
Or he hit his head and had amnesia.

32:32.620 --> 32:38.520
Or he just wanted a different
life, not with us.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.721
Mom...

32:54.340 --> 32:56.844
you can't do this.

32:58.020 --> 33:01.241
You're off the medication,
it's putting you in a rut.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.859
They're not helping.

33:03.860 --> 33:06.524
I don't want to feel numb.

33:07.900 --> 33:12.805
It's just that, you know, your dad,

33:14.020 --> 33:17.019
he never broke a promise, ever.

33:17.020 --> 33:22.219
And I just, I remember his
face at the airport so vividly

33:22.220 --> 33:23.539
and the way that he looked at me.

33:23.540 --> 33:26.419
- It just looked like he knew something.
- You can't... you can't do this again.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.179
- But... You can't think like that.
- I just want to know!

33:28.180 --> 33:28.939
It doesn't matter.

33:28.940 --> 33:32.379
- It's... that's the only thing I want!
- It doesn't matter. You can't...

33:32.380 --> 33:37.171
What difference does it make?
He's gone! He's dead.

33:50.620 --> 33:53.488
This time I'm late.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.659
I can't go.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.179
What is it?

33:59.180 --> 34:01.525
My mom...

34:02.620 --> 34:04.931
Is she okay?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.804
I shouldn't leave her alone.

34:09.340 --> 34:12.163
Is that what you were
trying to tell me earlier?

34:14.100 --> 34:16.967
You want to know why
I'm not going to MIT?

34:18.020 --> 34:20.649
I can't leave her alone.

34:22.540 --> 34:25.248
I wish it were different.

34:26.260 --> 34:28.579
I'm sorry. I know we had plans.

34:28.580 --> 34:31.179
Sometimes it's hard not to
take everything you do for me

34:31.179 --> 34:33.219
for granted.

34:33.219 --> 34:37.806
Of all people, you don't
have to apologize.

34:43.020 --> 34:47.969
You know, I've been carrying
this around for weeks.

34:48.659 --> 34:51.018
I was going to give it to
you after grad, but, I...

34:51.020 --> 34:53.001
I just can't wait.

34:59.580 --> 35:02.847
Have you had this all these years?

35:03.820 --> 35:06.563
They still don't make them, but...

35:07.060 --> 35:09.371
Is that a baby?

35:12.060 --> 35:14.803
Let me know when you're
ready for the real thing.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.201
Soon.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.179
I...

35:27.180 --> 35:29.139
I got to check on her. I'm sorry.

35:29.140 --> 35:30.499
Do you want me to stay,
keep you company?

35:30.500 --> 35:31.419
No, thanks.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.819
I don't think she'd want
you to see her like this.

35:34.820 --> 35:36.881
Careful.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.819
But you... you go to the play

35:39.820 --> 35:42.085
Not if you aren't.

35:49.020 --> 35:51.179
I'll call you later, okay.

35:51.180 --> 35:53.411
I'm sorry.

37:28.100 --> 37:28.819
Come on, Mom.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.722
You miss anymore classes you're
going to be worse than me.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.600
Mom...

37:36.700 --> 37:38.379
Mom.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.019
Oh fuck!

37:40.020 --> 37:41.099
Fuck.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.365
Mom!

37:46.460 --> 37:48.521
Mom?

37:49.300 --> 37:52.539
I... I need an ambulance
at 1637 Sherwood Drive.

37:52.540 --> 37:54.179
No!

37:54.180 --> 37:55.499
My... my mom's not...

37:55.500 --> 37:57.686
she's not breathing.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.043
No, I can't. She's not breathing.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.539
Oh, please.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.139
Come on.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.565
What do I do?

38:07.860 --> 38:11.889
No, Mom, come on. Fuck! No. No.

38:11.940 --> 38:14.171
No.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.882
I said things to her
I shouldn't have.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.605
I'll get some water.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.379
Give me a minute.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.819
I'll meet you at the car.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.131
Okay.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.726
Grandpa.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.802
Is there any chance what
you were saying is true?

39:30.460 --> 39:33.089
Walk me through the research.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.659
By the way, my secretary
has access to the lab

39:45.660 --> 39:47.739
but knows nothing of this and
I'd like to keep it that way.

39:47.740 --> 39:48.739
Yeah, sure.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.139
I suggest you follow suit.

39:50.140 --> 39:52.246
Don't tell anyone.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.779
Accounts for more than half
the increase last year

39:55.780 --> 39:58.859
in the GNH of Ghana and the
source has been verified twice.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.330
It's in the bibliography.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.579
Well, that's excellent work.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.367
Thank you.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.619
How do you feel?

40:13.620 --> 40:15.419
Relieved.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.939
So are we celebrating or what?

40:16.940 --> 40:18.019
Yeah, absolutely.

40:18.020 --> 40:20.219
I just have to check on something
with gramps in the lab.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.259
Everything okay?

40:21.260 --> 40:22.379
Yeah. I'm just helping
him with something.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.059
That's great. What?

40:24.060 --> 40:25.379
Theoretical stuff.

40:25.380 --> 40:26.899
Wormhole theories.

40:26.900 --> 40:27.699
Science fiction?

40:27.700 --> 40:28.619
Yeah, kind of.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.379
Helps me relax, do something fun.

40:31.380 --> 40:32.259
I'm glad.

40:32.260 --> 40:36.050
So I'll call you later? Congrats.

40:41.100 --> 40:44.619
Grandpa, if this is true,
why would he want to

40:44.620 --> 40:47.761
meet with Einstein after
he invented the machine?

40:47.780 --> 40:49.499
Well, read it.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.099
Can't you just tell me?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.699
I'm not entirely sure
what to tell you

40:52.700 --> 40:54.499
but obviously it's important.

40:54.500 --> 40:58.131
Okay. "The Lorentz Transformation"?

40:58.140 --> 40:59.819
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.449
Your orders, gentlemen.

41:02.980 --> 41:04.099
Coffee for the young man.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.047
Thank you.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.819
And Earl Grey for the Professor.

41:08.820 --> 41:10.721
Thank you.

41:10.980 --> 41:13.819
Uh, I'm done for the evening.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.019
Need anything else?

41:15.020 --> 41:17.763
Uh, no. No. Thank you.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.206
Okay.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.499
Gramps...?

41:24.500 --> 41:26.526
Shut it.

41:30.580 --> 41:31.259
Hey.

41:31.260 --> 41:32.859
Hey. Where are you?

41:32.860 --> 41:36.099
Uh, swamped. I don't
think I can make it.

41:36.100 --> 41:36.699
Sorry.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.859
Wow. Doesn't sound very relaxing.

41:38.860 --> 41:41.019
Well, you know,
occupational hazard.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.459
Well, don't work too hard.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.600
Okay, I won't.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.447
Bye.

41:47.780 --> 41:51.499
So assume that in three
dimensions the X, Y and Z axis

41:51.500 --> 41:54.339
are all parallel to their
respective counterparts.

41:54.340 --> 41:59.059
And the relative velocity between the two
observers is V along the common x-axis.

41:59.060 --> 42:02.219
So the two observers are using their own
Cartesian system to measure the intervals.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.099
Exactly.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.286
There's your negative energy.

43:05.180 --> 43:06.819
This is so dangerous.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.179
For a person to be inside this

43:08.180 --> 43:10.379
while it travels
through a wormhole.

43:10.380 --> 43:15.410
And even if it does work,
I mean, my father was killed.

43:23.100 --> 43:23.779
Hey.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.819
Hi.

43:24.820 --> 43:26.139
What are you doing here?

43:26.140 --> 43:27.819
What are you working on?

43:27.820 --> 43:28.899
Experiment, actually.

43:28.900 --> 43:31.539
It's kind of volatile.

43:31.540 --> 43:32.819
Does it have something
to do with travelling

43:32.820 --> 43:35.563
through a Wormhole into the past?

43:37.140 --> 43:42.682
"Victim suffered a gunshot wound
and carried no identification.

43:43.220 --> 43:46.299
Brands of clothing, unidentifiable.

43:46.300 --> 43:49.979
The assailants left only his
pocket watch and his keys.

43:49.980 --> 43:52.499
No witnesses, no suspects."

43:52.500 --> 43:55.323
I... I think this is my father.

43:56.660 --> 44:00.259
I have to stop this
from happening in 1946.

44:00.260 --> 44:02.219
I know it's hard to believe.

44:02.220 --> 44:04.459
That's why I didn't tell you.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.619
And... and the chances
of us succeeding

44:06.620 --> 44:08.219
and doing something
like this are... are...

44:08.220 --> 44:13.125
are so small, but we have to try.

44:13.500 --> 44:18.371
But the payoff, everything
will be different.

44:18.500 --> 44:21.164
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

44:21.620 --> 44:23.379
You believe me, right?

44:23.380 --> 44:26.219
I believe you believe it, but...

44:26.220 --> 44:28.690
I know, it's crazy.

44:29.700 --> 44:32.967
I felt the same way
as you, at first.

44:35.460 --> 44:38.089
I have to get back to work.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.379
Tonight, I'll make dinner.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.859
You can ask me anything you want.

44:46.860 --> 44:49.489
I'll... I'll explain
the science behind it.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.846
Okay.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.899
Why didn't you tell mom
what you were doing?

44:59.900 --> 45:01.539
Because I wouldn't
sure I'd succeed.

45:01.540 --> 45:03.179
I didn't want to
give her false hope.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.499
She needed to move on,
try to enjoy her life

45:05.500 --> 45:07.299
in whatever form she could.

45:07.300 --> 45:09.019
Are you sure that was
the right choice?

45:09.020 --> 45:12.499
No, but I couldn't help but think
that if she did latch onto

45:12.500 --> 45:15.259
the possibility of
bringing your father back,

45:15.260 --> 45:16.699
couple that with her depression...

45:16.700 --> 45:19.859
You were already afraid that she
was going to take her own life.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.059
Exactly.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.579
Why suffer through
the waiting period

45:22.580 --> 45:24.970
if it'll all be corrected.

45:25.740 --> 45:28.379
You're not thinking
of telling Grace?

45:28.380 --> 45:29.779
No.

45:29.780 --> 45:32.330
No, of course not.

45:38.540 --> 45:40.407
Like old times.

45:44.220 --> 45:49.019
If this works and you bring
your father back to 2000

45:49.020 --> 45:52.259
what will happen to our lives
for the past twelve years?

45:52.260 --> 45:54.844
My parents will be alive.

45:55.380 --> 45:59.819
I'll... I'll be a happier
person, be more confident.

45:59.820 --> 46:01.259
I won't be acting out of fear

46:01.260 --> 46:04.083
that I'll lose the
people around me.

46:04.180 --> 46:05.779
We... we're only changing one thing

46:05.780 --> 46:07.939
that shouldn't have happened.

46:07.940 --> 46:09.939
And so I don't...

46:09.940 --> 46:12.459
I don't see your life
path changing that much.

46:12.460 --> 46:16.339
You know, you'd have the same interests,
you'd go into the same field.

46:16.340 --> 46:19.891
And we'd have no
memory of this life?

46:23.620 --> 46:25.819
Sounds perfect...

46:25.820 --> 46:28.019
if we're together.

46:28.020 --> 46:29.179
Why wouldn't we be together?

46:29.180 --> 46:31.499
Well, nothing's guaranteed, right?

46:31.500 --> 46:33.459
I mean, I could get hit by a bus
or you could meet some other

46:33.460 --> 46:37.139
girl going to the movies with
your dad and ask her out to prom?

46:37.140 --> 46:38.659
I'm not going to ask anyone
else out to the prom.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.539
No, I'm serious.

46:40.540 --> 46:45.059
You gravitated towards me as a child
partly because you were missing a parent.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.539
That first time you stayed at my place
was when your mom went to Princeton.

46:48.540 --> 46:52.842
We spent day and night together,
and that won't happen now.

46:53.260 --> 46:56.539
None of this will exist.

46:56.540 --> 46:59.363
And we won't even
know what this was.

47:00.420 --> 47:02.539
What are the chances we repeat it?

47:02.540 --> 47:05.807
We knew each other
well before 2000.

47:05.900 --> 47:09.610
We were inseparable as children
before my father left.

47:09.700 --> 47:12.250
We'll be together again.

47:12.540 --> 47:14.859
I know it.

47:14.860 --> 47:17.205
I'm sure of it.

47:26.620 --> 47:27.979
I love you.

47:27.980 --> 47:29.961
I love you too.

47:39.260 --> 47:41.605
Wait. Wait. Wait. One second!

47:41.620 --> 47:42.779
Erol.

47:42.780 --> 47:43.899
Just one second.

47:43.900 --> 47:46.739
Honey, it's just a
fucking chess board.

47:46.740 --> 47:48.739
I just need some
things to motivate me.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.299
Some things?

47:50.300 --> 47:51.059
What?

47:51.060 --> 47:52.179
It's everything.

47:52.180 --> 47:53.339
It's just the chess board.

47:53.340 --> 47:55.810
No, it's our life.

47:56.180 --> 47:59.539
If you had the chance would you just
keep re-setting it 'til it was perfect?

47:59.540 --> 48:00.939
This is coming from
an idealist who...

48:00.940 --> 48:04.219
who spent the past two years studying
new economies for developing countries?

48:04.220 --> 48:06.499
No, Erol, I'm a realist.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.339
What's wrong with idealism?

48:08.340 --> 48:09.779
What's wrong with wanting
a mother and a father

48:09.780 --> 48:11.019
who aren't dead?

48:11.020 --> 48:12.819
That's not fair. I didn't
choose any of this.

48:12.820 --> 48:15.848
No, you didn't, but please...

48:16.220 --> 48:19.202
please don't pretend
like you understand.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.691
Grace...

48:26.660 --> 48:29.299
We have a life here.

48:29.300 --> 48:31.059
We talked about getting married,

48:31.060 --> 48:35.099
said we were getting a new
place and start a family.

48:35.100 --> 48:38.459
My father left unnaturally.
It had ripple effects...

48:38.460 --> 48:40.739
- That we're dealing with!
- No, that I'm correcting.

48:40.740 --> 48:42.459
Everyone that he might
have encountered,

48:42.460 --> 48:46.370
- their lives have to revert back to...
- I'm pregnant!

48:47.340 --> 48:50.163
How're you going to correct that?

50:21.860 --> 50:24.489
How long?

50:25.460 --> 50:27.805
Five weeks.

50:31.300 --> 50:33.929
What do you want to do?

50:35.220 --> 50:38.407
I don't know. I need time to think.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.459
Stop working on this.

50:45.460 --> 50:48.203
I don't know if I can.

50:50.180 --> 50:53.082
Well, there's your answer then.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.619
Is there any way to
make sure that Grace

50:58.620 --> 51:00.419
and I will be together
in the new timeline?

51:00.420 --> 51:03.099
You shouldn't be thinking about
messing with other elements.

51:03.100 --> 51:05.699
The point here is
to correct things,

51:05.700 --> 51:07.339
not create an ideal
world for yourself.

51:07.340 --> 51:08.259
That is correct.

51:08.260 --> 51:09.379
We're meant to be together.

51:09.380 --> 51:11.699
So what, do you want to go back,
talk to yourself as a kid

51:11.700 --> 51:13.619
and plant the idea
to woo her again?

51:13.620 --> 51:14.259
I don't know.

51:14.260 --> 51:16.339
The more attachments you make here,

51:16.340 --> 51:19.527
the harder this will all be.

51:20.860 --> 51:23.619
- How's the field stability?
- Terrible.

51:23.620 --> 51:25.059
I've just been stuck for weeks.

51:25.060 --> 51:28.327
Well, you're doing great.
Just keep at it, okay.

51:29.260 --> 51:30.059
I got to go.

51:30.060 --> 51:30.699
All right.

51:30.700 --> 51:33.179
- You going to be okay?
- Yeah.

51:33.180 --> 51:35.366
See you later.

51:44.140 --> 51:46.819
All right, you're eight weeks in,
so it's still too early to tell.

51:46.820 --> 51:48.699
But it looks good so far.

51:48.700 --> 51:51.139
But I wouldn't tell your friends
for another month. Okay?

51:51.140 --> 51:51.699
Okay.

51:51.700 --> 51:53.726
All right.

52:10.100 --> 52:10.659
No.

52:10.660 --> 52:11.299
What?

52:11.300 --> 52:13.059
It should be working.

52:13.060 --> 52:15.539
The tangent vectors are correct,
I have D-S-squared defined,

52:15.540 --> 52:18.259
but the accelerated end keeps
going off into who knows where?

52:18.260 --> 52:20.810
Okay just... just calm down.

52:21.180 --> 52:24.059
Uh... chalk?

52:24.060 --> 52:26.405
Second drawer.

52:30.620 --> 52:32.646
There's none left.

52:32.700 --> 52:33.899
What difference does it make?

52:33.900 --> 52:36.962
If I can't solve it,
how the hell can you?

52:39.580 --> 52:41.019
Is he okay?

52:41.020 --> 52:42.899
Yeah, he'll be fine.

52:42.900 --> 52:45.245
Thanks, Mrs. Moore.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.770
Are you all right?

52:49.580 --> 52:52.099
Been a long time since
someone asked me that.

52:52.100 --> 52:53.459
Well, I...

52:53.460 --> 52:56.681
I've been meaning to ask you often.

52:57.180 --> 52:59.570
I'm fine, thanks.

53:01.220 --> 53:05.219
I've noticed, Professor,
that outside of the lab

53:05.220 --> 53:07.299
you're always alone.

53:07.300 --> 53:11.841
If... if you ever need
to talk, I'm here.

53:13.100 --> 53:15.379
I wish I could.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.567
Maybe someday you'll
tell me why you can't?

53:18.740 --> 53:21.881
I hope to be able to do that.

53:44.580 --> 53:45.939
Hello?

53:45.940 --> 53:47.619
Grace, it's Sal.

53:47.620 --> 53:48.579
Hi.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.379
Do you have a minute?

53:50.380 --> 53:51.979
Not sure, really.

53:51.980 --> 53:55.645
I just wanted to ask, how
has Erol been lately?

53:56.020 --> 53:58.099
I haven't really seen him.

53:58.100 --> 54:01.259
I'm asleep when he gets home
and he's asleep when I leave.

54:01.260 --> 54:03.739
I'm worried about him.

54:03.740 --> 54:06.339
With all due respect, you put
this idea of "correcting"

54:06.340 --> 54:08.259
everything into his head.

54:08.260 --> 54:11.447
Why would you care how he is?

54:17.540 --> 54:19.099
Hi.

54:19.100 --> 54:21.206
Hey.

54:21.260 --> 54:23.299
How are you feeling?

54:23.300 --> 54:25.326
Okay.

54:25.420 --> 54:27.939
I got you chocolate milk and bacon.

54:27.940 --> 54:30.285
Thanks.

54:31.700 --> 54:34.762
I'll be working in the
basement if you need me.

54:59.220 --> 55:01.849
Can we talk about this?

55:02.860 --> 55:05.250
Say something.

55:06.420 --> 55:07.579
What do you want to hear?

55:07.580 --> 55:11.339
Every day I'm afraid this will all disappear
because part of me knows you'll succeed.

55:11.340 --> 55:16.699
But I want nothing more
than for you to fail.

55:16.700 --> 55:19.259
Well, you might get your wish.

55:19.260 --> 55:21.259
We've hit a snag.

55:21.260 --> 55:22.499
Been stuck for weeks.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.059
So you're stopping?

55:24.060 --> 55:26.659
I can't stop until
I've tried everything.

55:26.660 --> 55:28.846
You know that.

55:29.340 --> 55:31.499
So what do you want?

55:31.500 --> 55:33.499
What should I do?

55:33.500 --> 55:34.539
Abort?

55:34.540 --> 55:35.459
No!

55:35.460 --> 55:36.819
Isn't that what you're doing?

55:36.820 --> 55:38.419
No.

55:38.420 --> 55:40.179
All of this will happen again.

55:40.180 --> 55:41.739
It'll be better.

55:41.740 --> 55:45.059
Do you ever think that maybe your
father was meant to die there?

55:45.060 --> 55:48.930
That was his natural
course and this is ours?

55:49.820 --> 55:54.979
Don't you see, Erol, despite
everything I like this life.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.019
I like who I am.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.419
And I fell in love with
you as you were here.

55:58.420 --> 56:03.059
Grace, as I am, I'll
make a terrible father.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.419
I don't want to pass
this down to our child.

56:05.420 --> 56:07.499
- I want a clean slate.
- Nobody has a clean slate!

56:07.500 --> 56:11.085
Because nobody gets the
chance to have one.

56:11.860 --> 56:15.579
I can't live like this,
knowing our lives could end

56:15.580 --> 56:17.899
- at any second and we have no say.
- Most people don't.

56:17.900 --> 56:20.723
And most people don't sleep
with the Grim Reaper.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.859
Can you look me in
the eye and tell me,

56:24.860 --> 56:27.419
with absolute assurance,

56:27.420 --> 56:30.322
that if you go through with this,

56:30.460 --> 56:33.601
we'd be able to recreate...

56:33.740 --> 56:39.487
the soul of this baby?

56:47.380 --> 56:49.099
Yeah.

56:49.100 --> 56:51.099
I'll stop.

56:51.100 --> 56:53.525
I'll stop.

56:57.020 --> 56:59.139
You're right.

56:59.140 --> 57:01.619
There's no guarantee.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.819
I can't lose you.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.939
I'll tell Sal I'm not
doing this anymore.

57:05.940 --> 57:08.171
Okay?

57:16.860 --> 57:19.459
The first time your mother
tried to commit suicide,

57:19.460 --> 57:22.044
it was just before I moved here.

57:22.740 --> 57:26.211
My God, you were only 15 years old.

57:26.780 --> 57:28.059
The night before that happened,

57:28.060 --> 57:31.819
I tried to convince her to
go out with another man.

57:31.820 --> 57:39.126
I wanted her to move on, but she
flat-out rejected the idea.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.731
We argued.

57:42.820 --> 57:44.739
I told her she was being foolish
for holding onto the memory

57:44.740 --> 57:47.099
of your father for so long.

57:47.100 --> 57:49.604
And the next day...

57:51.820 --> 57:55.451
She never stopped loving him.

57:56.820 --> 57:59.449
When your child's in distress...

58:03.020 --> 58:06.241
This was never supposed
to be her life.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.562
It's my child I have
to protect now.

58:14.180 --> 58:16.764
I'm sorry.

58:23.860 --> 58:25.699
As I said, it's four bedrooms.

58:25.700 --> 58:27.219
I understand you're expecting.

58:27.220 --> 58:29.019
We only need two.

58:29.020 --> 58:30.939
Ah, four's better.

58:30.940 --> 58:31.619
Really?

58:31.620 --> 58:33.859
Yeah. You never know.

58:33.860 --> 58:35.659
Easy for you to say.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.766
And do.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.899
So there's a large living area.

58:46.900 --> 58:48.899
Perfect for a TV and
a sitting room.

58:48.900 --> 58:50.219
Yeah.

58:50.220 --> 58:51.659
TV right here.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.539
I can have my recliner back here.

58:53.540 --> 58:56.499
- No. I don't want our kid watching TV.
- What?

58:56.500 --> 58:59.179
- But I was going to...
- What? You don't like TV either.

58:59.180 --> 59:03.539
Yeah, but I could lie around on Sundays,
have my buddies over, drink some beers.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.899
You don't have any buddies.

59:04.900 --> 59:06.139
I'll make buddies.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.379
And you'll hate every one of them.

59:08.380 --> 59:10.691
Do you have a girlfriend?

59:25.580 --> 59:27.641
Play it out.

59:29.100 --> 59:31.650
I'm serious, play it out.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.979
We can always just suck it up
and do the banquet hall thing.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.259
Why don't we do it
at the new place?

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.499
There's room in the back yard.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.299
We can just keep it to
close friends and family.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.361
Small.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.846
Erol...

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.979
What?

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.211
What is it?

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.219
How?

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.219
It's hard to pinpoint.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.859
It was still early
in the pregnancy.

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.019
May not have been a
fully viable embryo.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.259
Could it have been stress?

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.499
Could have been a factor, sure.
But sometimes it's...

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.459
it's just spontaneous.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.539
I'm sorry.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.090
I'll check in on her
again in an hour.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.819
Hi.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.059
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.803
I figured you might come here.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.844
Is Grace still at the hospital?

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.085
This isn't it.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.482
My dad doesn't get
shot in an alley,

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.489
mom doesn't take those pills.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:28.121
My child does not spontaneously...

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.619
Every time I try to
commit to this life,

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.045
something tells me
that I shouldn't.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.368
Sometimes I can see all the things that
were supposed to happen so clearly.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.499
Grace comes to Cambridge
with me, we have a family.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.059
It can all still happen.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.459
It has to.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.699
Well, it's up to you, kiddo.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.019
You said we were close.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.481
We are, it's just this
one problem with the...

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.979
Earthquakes.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.939
What do you mean?

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.819
We want to leave from here and
land on this spot in 1946.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.379
Now we know how the earth moves.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.459
We know where it will
be in its solar orbit.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.419
Our nutation calculations
were correct,

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.179
but in calculating the
rate of the earth's spin,

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.499
I completely forgot to account
for the seismic events

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.739
that alter the balance
of the earth's mass.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.099
And, therefore, the rate of spin.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.419
Thirty-one events since 1946
that significantly altered

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.939
the rate of rotation.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.579
Last year's earthquake
in Japan, alone,

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.099
shortened the earth's day by
1.8 millionths of a second.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.339
So we add that to the known
affects of ocean currents

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.605
and atmospheric winds...

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.059
Exactly where and when we want.

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.539
The computer was
calculating correctly,

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.442
I just wasn't feeding
it the right variables.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.251
You've done it.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.483
Now, a couple more weeks of tests

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.568
and I guess we'll never
know this happened.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.099
Your father would, in
theory, be the only one

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.659
who'd remember any of this,

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.579
since his life would
be uninterrupted

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.245
from the moment we
intercepted him, onwards.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.539
So now what's the plan?

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.646
Okay.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.099
I meet him as soon as he
gets of the plane in Newark.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.339
I think we should let as much of that
timeline occur before his disappearance.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.819
- Gramps.
- What?

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.219
I'm going to go, not you.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.659
No. If this doesn't work
you still have a life.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.019
It won't matter.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.419
This timeline will continue.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.779
We'll test it and make
sure everything is safe.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.739
But even if I don't succeed,
for whatever reason,

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:55.539
you'll know because
nothing changes.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.619
And, at that point, you can do
whatever you think is necessary,

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.579
but I have to try it my way.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.819
What is your way?

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.659
Well, talking to him at the
airport isn't going to be enough.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.099
That depends on what we say.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.139
He has to tell Marika.
That's the key.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.419
She has to be aware
of his intentions,

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.019
then they can play
it out after that.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.739
No. We have to ensure that
he doesn't do it again.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.779
If we Ebenezer Scrooge
him here and now

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.339
we could cease to exist
because he would have already

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.499
avoided the mugging.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.379
Our only asset is that we have
his memory in 2000 and 1946.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.059
That's the only thing that's going
to survive after the correction.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.779
In theory.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.939
We have to show him
the damage he's done

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.808
without removing him
from his reality.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:38.899
Just sign here.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.689
Your instructor will be
with you in a few minutes.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.248
It's not about correcting anymore.

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.139
I'm going to make sure this
doesn't happen to us again,

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.280
whatever it takes.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.219
Next time we meet we'll have
our whole wonderful lives

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.539
ahead of us.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.805
I promise.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.765
What is this?

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.619
Instructions for your
father to make sure

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.859
I visit Professor Gale's
chemistry department

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.739
on May 15, 2012.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.880
Why?

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.326
Mrs. Moore will be
there, if you must know.

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.125
Ready?

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.619
So if nothing happens in three days

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.899
it's up to you to do it right.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.131
Understood.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.899
You know, if this works I'll
never be able to thank you.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.739
No, you won't.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.579
And I won't know if you've been
incinerated for three days.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.811
Well, the tests went fine.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.970
I hope you'll visit
us more, Grandpa.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.322
See you in another life, kiddo.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.099
See you Friday.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.286
Okay.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.299
Say hi to dad.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.326
Will do.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.059
Hi.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:08.939
Come on, honey.

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.099
We got to go. Got to go.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.365
Got to go.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:21.979
Hello?

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.139
Hey, Sal, how are you?

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.299
I'm great.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.139
Good flight?

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.339
Yes, thanks.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.179
I'm just getting out. I'll come
by after I check into the hotel.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.939
Perfect. See you then.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.618
He's just growing up so fast. He's
got the same love of science as me.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.419
But it's like Marika's
artistic flare

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.578
kind of balances him out somehow.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.211
He's probably a better critical
thinker than I ever was.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.242
Perhaps another student for me?

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.459
So this is the place?

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.618
Yes, indeed.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.019
It's a dead space.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.339
You'll be lucky if you see a
janitor down here once a week.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.844
Some things never change.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.651
Can I ask what this is all about?

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.538
I'm sorry.

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.179
After your dissertation I
promised never to question you

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.979
again, I take it back.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.179
No, I just...

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.939
I guess I want somewhere
quiet to work, that's all.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:17.085
- You okay for light?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.459
Listen, I really appreciate this.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.698
Thank you. Do you want to
meet up for lunch tomorrow?

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.059
Yeah, sure.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.179
Just let's touch
base in the morning.

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.419
- If you need anything else let me know.
- I will do.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.399
- It's good to see you, Gabe.
- Good to see you too.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.459
Good luck.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.600
Thanks.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.339
Hello?

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.499
Hey, sleepy.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.579
Hm.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.299
What time is it?

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:09.939
Six thirty.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.339
How's the conference?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.579
I'm about to find out.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:13.859
You need to get up.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.419
Talk to you later, okay?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:15.979
Oh.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.499
Okay.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.419
Bye, my darlin'.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.321
Bye.

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.259
If you're looking
for the Professor,

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.579
he's on his Saturday morning walk.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.899
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- No.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.768
Why don't you people
go to his office?

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:02.086
What'll you have?

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.259
Johnny.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.019
That's right.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.899
Coffee?

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.099
Sure.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.579
Make that two.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.686
They're on me.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.659
Oh no. That's not necessary.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.499
No, please.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.811
Where are you from?

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:20.659
Well, London, originally.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.971
Great city.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.179
Welcome to Jersey.

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.730
Thanks Thanks, Johnny.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.499
So what brings you here?

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.619
Work.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.010
What kind of work do you do?

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.019
I've had a very strange day.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.179
I don't mean to be rude.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.339
That's okay.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.419
You new here?

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.379
Yeah.

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.139
A wild guess.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.326
You're in research?

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.699
Takes one to know one.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.329
Institute or university?

01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.339
I can't really talk about it.

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.579
It's okay. I can't tell you

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.881
that I'm here on a theoretical
physics scholarship.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.699
You're very young.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.090
What are you working on?

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.819
I'm doing a paper on a
phenomenon called wormholes.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.179
It's purely theoretical.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.099
My mentor, Dr. Weyl's
the real expert.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.729
I'm just learning about it.

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:21.005
My name's Erol.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.499
My son's name's Erol.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.979
Really?

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.120
Where's he?

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.419
At home.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.560
How long you here for?

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.179
Not long.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.179
Well, that's good.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.699
One thing I found in travelling is

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.682
that you can't stay away
from home too long.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.379
Not good for family life.

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:43.619
If I may ask, what angle are you
researching on wormhole theory?

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.727
What the implications of
a stable one would be.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.819
Really? What have you found so far?

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.899
Do you love them?

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.939
What?

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.490
Your family. Do you love them?

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.779
Yeah, I love my work and my family.

01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:00.011
That must be nice.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.379
In my experience, one or
the other has to give.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.379
Well, it's just a matter of
finding the right balance.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.442
Do you mind if I ask you how
you found that balance?

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.219
I don't know.

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:13.409
Well, you're doing better than
I am. I got no wife, no kids.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.739
Both my parents are dead.

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:16.539
I'm...

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:18.579
I'm sorry.

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.845
Yeah, you should be.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.219
Oh, well, good luck
with your paper.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.459
Actually, my father's not dead yet.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.779
He left me when I was nine.

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.859
My mom and I dropped him
off at the airport.

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:32.939
He was going on a business
trip to Princeton

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.339
and he was supposed to
come back in a few days,

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.539
but he never did.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.930
We waited a long time.

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.259
I mean, my mom did.

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:44.527
It was so long ago I don't
really remember him.

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.099
My mom went back to school
and became a professor.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.099
And she was inspired in her work.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.099
But she never got
over the confusion

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.889
of not knowing where
my father went.

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:57.699
I think she thought he ran
off with another woman.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:01.809
She was devastated and
she took her own life.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.259
Then my grandfather
came to me and he said

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:10.419
that we could find my father
if we worked together.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:15.370
It would take time, maybe years
to figure out what he had done.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.130
But we did it.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.209
I haven't seen him in 12 years.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.566
Erol?

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.330
Oh my God.

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.964
So tell me about Einstein.

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.139
That's why you're here, isn't it?

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.019
Huh? Yeah.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.459
Why?

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:40.404
What... what could he possibly tell
you that you don't already know?

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.885
First tell me...

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.724
what happens to me?

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.979
Tonight you're mugged.

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:56.120
They kill you.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.846
That's it.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.649
All this work and some guys take
you for the money in your pocket.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:09.979
What is this?

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.219
It's you.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.691
It's your suit, it's
your description.

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:19.287
They left your pocket watch.
I don't know why.

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.808
You're wearing your keys
in your left pocket?

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.126
Yeah.

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.724
The basement wall?

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.968
This is everything you've
missed for 12 years.

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.123
You really were a good father.

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.405
I was a happy kid.

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.370
How did she die?

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.246
Pills.

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.539
It was her third try.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.899
She couldn't bear not knowing

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.962
why the love of her life vanished.

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.939
And you...?

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.099
I lost everything.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.899
And I rebuilt your dream.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.899
It's all here.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.644
All because you wouldn't tell
her what you were doing.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:37.499
So you tell me, why?

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.579
I... I tried. I tried
so many times.

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.979
You never said the words,
"I'm building a..."

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.419
She didn't want to hear it.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:43.939
She...

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.899
anything that would
change our life, she...

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.779
she... she wouldn't have it.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.739
She's happy, you know.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.099
I decided I... I can travel.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.259
I can go, I can come back.

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.339
She'll never know.

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:57.179
Try and speak in the past tense.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.684
It was a long time ago.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:04.089
Mom didn't sign up for this.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.099
Signed up?

01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.206
Right.

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.459
This is the most important
discovery in history.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.819
Imagine the good that
we can do with this.

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.539
No.

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.019
You have to choose.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.179
It's one or the other.

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.859
Your family or this.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:26.139
Well, then family.

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:28.530
Always family.

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:35.121
I never knew that
this would happen.

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.770
Okay.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.891
It's really you.

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.041
You're a man.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.699
And you...

01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:02.403
What, it took you what, under a
year to do what took me decades.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:08.051
Your mother was right.
You are a genius.

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.646
I'm not.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.645
I'm not a genius.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.047
I've been selfish and neglectful.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.859
I had a child.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:29.331
I had a life with Grace
and I fucked it up.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.019
Little Grace, our neighbour?

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:34.241
You are the only one
who can fix this now.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.219
I will.

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.610
I promise you.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.804
I've missed you.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.121
I'm sorry.

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.805
I'm sorry.

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.085
Okay.

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:01.459
Okay.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.379
No, just give me a couple of
days and I'm going to go back

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.899
and I'm going to talk to your
mom. I'm going to tell her.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.219
I'm going to make sure
there's no misunderstanding.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.219
A couple of days?

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:10.059
Listen, I'll have to...
I have to finish my work here.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.459
Einstein's going to help me set
up the parameters of its use.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.019
I've finished the work he started.
That's why I'm here.

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.739
Create safeguards, okay, to prevent
this kind of thing from happening.

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:22.579
- That's what he did with the atomic bomb.
- You can't. There are no parameters!

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:25.019
Einstein spoke against
the use of the bomb.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.459
Even... even with all my genius,
I couldn't begin to imagine

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.859
the chaos if even one
more person used this.

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:32.299
There are no exceptions.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.859
Al would tell you the same thing.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.219
You have to go back
now and destroy it.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.539
There's nothing wrong with
the technology. Nothing.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.579
Listen...

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.739
listen, I've been
very, very careless.

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.619
I realize that now. I've been
talking to strangers, even.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.659
I'm going to stay down
here the entire time.

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.859
Mom died because of this. Does
that mean anything to you?

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.699
Of course it does! That's why I
will avoid the mugging this time.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.939
Now you've given me what I need.

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:56.139
You can even stay here.

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:59.099
There's so many questions I want
to ask you. You've grown up.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.299
We can make...

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.019
together we can make sure
that I get back safe.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.819
I know you think you're being safe.

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.122
I know you think you're being careful,
but you have to look at the chart.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.419
Look at it.

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.845
Look at it carefully.

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.539
Why didn't you intercept
me before I left?

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.499
Why risk coming back?

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.845
That's the question, isn't it?

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.451
I wanted to see this.

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:38.099
I wanted to see the
fruits of your labour.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:42.721
The glorious unknown that
you gave up everything for.

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:47.179
I hoped you'd go back immediately

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:52.051
and you could erase the
last 4556 days of my life.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.770
And I'd be a child,

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.499
looking up at you with wonder as
you came back from your trip.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.499
And I will do.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.085
The problem is I
know how you think.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.687
You and I have lost
the same things.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:10.608
But I had to feel those losses.

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.819
I had to watch a loved one die.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.939
I had to create
safeguards to make sure

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.683
that this never happened again.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.849
You say you love mom and me?

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:41.259
More than anything.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.979
They love you too.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:48.419
Go back now and remember
the man I became

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.243
because of your choices.

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:53.459
Fuck!

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.459
No.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.299
Oh my God.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.059
No.

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.928
Oh my God.

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.459
First move the pawn to pawn three.

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.139
Hi.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.530
Honey, look who's here.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.440
Dad.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.721
Hi.

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.891
Hi, Mr. Whyte.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.245
You're early.

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:15.571
What happened?
