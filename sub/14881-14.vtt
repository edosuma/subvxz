<i>Salud.</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:19.612
<i>Salud.</i> You should go like this.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.924
<i>Yes, you can if they're cremated.</i>

04:51.190 --> 04:53.092
There are two fishies in there.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.512
Why are they eating cereal in there?

16:23.048 --> 16:25.317
This is one of the original mausoleums.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.087
These are a little bit older,
and you'll see the newer ones.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.154
People have gotten very creative.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.357
-This is really quiet.
-Yeah.

26:39.731 --> 26:40.966
Grandpa!

26:56.214 --> 26:57.749
-Do you like books?
-Yes.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.886
I like the baby ones.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.195
In Mommy's belly.

31:14.505 --> 31:15.540
Yeah.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.845
I'm gonna drink it all!

38:56.000 --> 38:58.135
This is crazy, though.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.806
And, it's my Mom's favorite wine,
so it's perfect.
