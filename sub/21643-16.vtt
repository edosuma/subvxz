00:08.007 --> 00:09.776
[narrator]  Currently on  Disjointed:

00:10.043 --> 00:14.247
[man on radio]  ...in exactly the same way,
you are never able, really, to examine,

00:14.314 --> 00:16.349
to make an object of your own mind.

00:16.416 --> 00:20.387
Just as you can't look directly
into your own eyes or bite your own teeth.

00:21.488 --> 00:22.756
Because you are that.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.292
And if you try to find it--

00:26.359 --> 00:27.427
[radio clicks off]

00:31.331 --> 00:32.665
That's what you're wearing?

00:33.333 --> 00:35.535
What? It's a funeral.
That's what you're wearing?

00:35.602 --> 00:38.538
It's a pot funeral.
People are gonna think you're a narc.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.440
Would a narc do this?

00:40.507 --> 00:43.076
Uh, yeah, with fake weed, Jump Street.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.446
Well, this shit's not fake.
In fact, it's Jack Heron.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.648
Seems appropriate
on the day of his funeral.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.049
Fair enough.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.319
That make you jealous,

00:53.787 --> 00:56.756
he's the only pot activist
with his own strain named after him?

00:56.823 --> 00:59.659
Well, it does, and it does.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.593
[engine starts]

01:01.795 --> 01:02.762
But he earned it.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.199
I mean, the man wrote  Hemp, Hemp, Hooray!

01:06.833 --> 01:09.202
For us stoners, that book was the Bible.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.438
'Cause we all owned it,
but we never read it.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.541
And what a big heart.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.576
True story.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.479
-We once got busted in Big Sur,
-And he bailed you out before himself.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.314
and he bailed me out before himself.

01:21.381 --> 01:25.084
-Do they make them like that anymore?
-They don't make them like that anymore.

01:25.151 --> 01:32.158
Jack, me, Scooter Boots, Captain Fred,
and Saul "The Muskrat" Fishkin.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.161
The Mount Rushmore
of people who got arrested

01:35.228 --> 01:37.430
trying to get high
at Mount Rushmore. [chuckles]

01:38.097 --> 01:40.133
Why were you protesting
at Mount Rushmore?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.802
Oh, we weren't protesting.
That's where our van broke down.

01:43.536 --> 01:46.573
And what the fuck else is there to do
in South Dakota?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.556
[indistinct chatter]

02:05.859 --> 02:07.594
Behold the spirit of the '60s.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.229
Yep, in its 70s.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.467
Narc. Narc!

02:18.471 --> 02:19.606
Ruth.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.541
Goddess of the Green.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.910
Scooter Boots. Pope of the Dope.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.645
-Oh, yeah.
-[laughs]

02:25.712 --> 02:27.814
-Buddy, it's been too long.
-Yeah.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.850
You still living in that nice place
up in Mendocino?

02:30.917 --> 02:32.852
Well, actually, it's a storage unit.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.189
But my roommates are pretty cool.

02:36.256 --> 02:37.557
[both laugh]

02:37.624 --> 02:38.825
I heard you're gay now?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.761
Yep, yep, yep.
Well, you-- Well, I always have been.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.298
But my mom just passed away, so...

02:46.266 --> 02:48.301
Whee! [chuckles]

02:48.835 --> 02:51.337
-How you doing, Travis?
-Hey, Scooter.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.339
-Oh, my God, you're all grown up.
-Well...

02:53.773 --> 02:57.477
I remember the day you were born.
We all gathered around the tub and I says:

02:57.911 --> 03:00.680
"Somebody ought to keep an eye
on that umbilical cord

03:00.880 --> 03:02.448
or it'll strangle that kid."

03:02.515 --> 03:04.317
[laughing]

03:04.751 --> 03:06.886
-[chuckles] Well, thank you.
-Mm.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.192
-It was good to see you.
-Yeah, well, it's good to see you, too.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.929
Hey, did I tell you
he went to business school?

03:16.529 --> 03:19.666
Oh, Ruth, I am so sorry.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.974
-It's so weird.
-What's that?

03:28.675 --> 03:32.445
Ever since we cleaned the water tank,
the plants have been growing like crazy.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.848
You mean like weeds?
'Cause that's what weeds do, they grow.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.617
Like kittens, puppies and cancer.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.621
No, this is different.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.724
It's almost like somebody
put something in the water

03:44.791 --> 03:46.626
that's making the plants overachieve.

03:46.859 --> 03:51.531
Like they're trying to please me
out of some combination of love and fear.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.469
[Jenny in Mandarin]
Is it possible? My mother was right!

03:56.703 --> 03:59.939
Her tea is turning the plants
into more upstanding plants!

04:00.406 --> 04:05.745
Wait: Does that mean all these years
the tea's been making me a better me?

04:06.546 --> 04:09.682
Who got straight "A's"?
Me or the pigs' testicles?

04:11.651 --> 04:13.519
[in English]
Hey, everybody, a little heads-up.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.355
[in Mandarin]
We'll think about this later.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.992
[in English] As you know,
Ruth and Travis went to the Heron funeral,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.293
so she left me in charge.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.263
-Question.
-Yes?

04:23.329 --> 04:26.366
If for some reason you are unable
to fulfill your duties,

04:26.799 --> 04:28.334
who is next in the chain of command?

04:28.768 --> 04:32.472
-Uh, is that really important?
-I'm just saying, if shit goes down,

04:33.373 --> 04:36.643
I don't wanna find us tits up
because you don't have a solid number two.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.478
[Pete laughing]

04:41.948 --> 04:42.915
What's so funny?

04:43.716 --> 04:45.485
He said "solid number two."

04:53.293 --> 04:57.363
[woman]  Everyone loves marijuana butter,
but who has time to make it?

04:57.430 --> 04:58.564
All the mixing...

05:00.933 --> 05:01.868
melting...

05:04.470 --> 05:05.371
pouring...

05:15.748 --> 05:16.749
[giggles]

05:16.816 --> 05:17.784
giggling...

05:20.620 --> 05:25.792
Hi, I'm paid actress Mary Fakename,
and this is the Bud Butter Buddy,

05:26.426 --> 05:31.097
the revolutionary invention that makes
making marijuana butter more good.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.632
Look to right.

05:33.866 --> 05:37.470
With the Bud Butter Buddy,
all you have to do is add butter...

05:39.439 --> 05:40.540
and cannabis.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.449
The secret is our O-N button...

05:49.515 --> 05:52.485
...which activates the machine
using the very electricity

05:52.552 --> 05:54.620
flowing through the walls of your home.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.523
[Mary]  Then kick back, light up a joint...

05:58.658 --> 06:00.827
and forget it for 30 minutes.

06:07.066 --> 06:07.967
What the--?

06:09.001 --> 06:12.071
Fuck. The butter.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.010
[Mary]  The Bud Butter Buddy,
available at these crappy-ass stores.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.785
[chanting in foreign language]

06:25.852 --> 06:27.520
[all chanting]

06:28.621 --> 06:30.923
Now, just the vegetarians.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.892
[all chanting]

06:45.404 --> 06:47.640
Next, we'll hear from Susan, Jack's widow.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.882
-Namaste.
-[all] Namaste.

06:56.783 --> 07:00.720
It was 15 years ago
Jack Heron first came into my life.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.522
More like onto her chest.

07:05.992 --> 07:10.196
I was a young college student
with no sense of purpose or self,

07:10.596 --> 07:13.199
and he was a 60-year-old activist
who had it all,

07:13.866 --> 07:17.136
a cause, a direction, a wife and kids.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.070
Hi, Bev.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.042
So, this is one of your heroes, huh?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.745
It was a more innocent time.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.948
Oh, so there was a time
when abandoning your family was innocent?

07:29.882 --> 07:31.684
There was a small window, yeah.

07:33.853 --> 07:34.921
That's hilarious.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.223
I gotta remember that for your eulogy.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.959
Oh, stop being such a buzzkill.
It's a funeral.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.201
Olivia, is it cool with you if--?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.703
You don't have to ask my permission
for anything.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.206
You can dance naked in the grow room
if you want.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.041
Oh, I already do that.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.111
I'm going to Tae Kwon Douglas'
for meditation class.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.882
Really? We have a boss-free day
and that's how you're gonna waste it?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.518
He said it's a way to get high
without pot,

08:05.585 --> 08:08.855
and I thought that might come in handy
if I ever fall down a well again.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.557
Okay.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.962
But I'm a little confused.
Isn't Tae Kwon Doug kind of an asshole?

08:16.629 --> 08:17.763
Normally, yes.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.233
But if you look deep into that asshole...

08:21.534 --> 08:23.002
there's a flower waiting to bloom.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.240
Okay, well, have fun.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.842
Wash your hands before you come back.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.049
Please welcome Jayte Matias,

08:38.116 --> 08:41.854
who will now celebrate Jack's life
with smoke rings.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.565
[gentle music playing over speakers]

09:12.985 --> 09:14.086
[man] Beautiful.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.254
That was nice.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.225
Oh, my God. That is really cool.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.228
Oh, please.
That's how Willie Nelson coughs.

09:30.002 --> 09:30.870
Carter.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.974
English for "He who carts."

09:36.242 --> 09:39.345
Put the cart in front of the horse
of a different Color Me Badd.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.080
-Oh, God!
-[chuckles]

09:41.747 --> 09:42.982
-Dank.
-Huh?

09:43.649 --> 09:45.251
-Danks for the memories.
-Oh, shit.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.654
-Danke Schoen.
-That was good.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.690
Septic Dank.

09:52.825 --> 09:53.693
Dank Dynasty.

09:54.193 --> 09:57.096
Oh, man, what happened to you?

09:57.163 --> 10:00.299
Yeah, man. You different as hell.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.636
Well, I am different as hell.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.705
-I recently started--
-Wait, we'll guess.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.073
-Ooh! I love guessing.
-No, no. No.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.141
You taking piano lessons
on a little piano.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.677
[Dank makes piano sounds]

10:11.744 --> 10:12.678
-Stop that.
-Okay.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.314
I'll give you a hint.

10:16.148 --> 10:17.183
Where do I work?

10:17.717 --> 10:19.685
I feel like you should know that shit.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.025
-Ding-dong.
-Ah-ah.

10:26.092 --> 10:26.959
Hold on.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.096
Oh!

10:30.162 --> 10:33.132
Dank, Dabby, are you guys familiar
with the Volcano Classic?

10:33.199 --> 10:36.702
Oh, yeah. It's great.
It comes with a replaceable air filter.

10:36.769 --> 10:40.640
-High-performance heat cartridge.
-Robust, completely mechanical design.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.109
Power air pump and silencer
with pressure-relief valve.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.043
Oh, God!

10:44.110 --> 10:45.945
Vaporization temperature adjustable

10:46.012 --> 10:50.082
between approximately 130 degrees Celsius
and 230 degrees Celsius.

10:50.149 --> 10:54.820
Which is 266 degrees Fahrenheit
and 446 degrees Fahrenheit.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.099
Wow, did you guys memorize the box?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.001
Holy shit, it comes with a box?

11:11.837 --> 11:13.305
[Doug inhales]

11:13.372 --> 11:16.142
[Doug] All right,
one more cleansing breath.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.110
[exhales]

11:18.944 --> 11:19.812
Good.

11:20.346 --> 11:24.950
Now, just relax and let yourself slip
into the gap between your thoughts.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.187
What if I only have one thought?

11:29.789 --> 11:31.991
-I don't know, think it twice.
-Okay.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.895
The gap between your thoughts is the now.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.797
Rest in the now.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.833
-Right now?
-Yeah, right now.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.905
Now, this is your home,
the eternal present.

11:46.472 --> 11:49.775
A realm of consciousness
that transcends time and space

11:49.842 --> 11:52.344
where nobody's snuffing derbs
or roping bongs.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.980
-Wow.
-Right?

11:55.347 --> 11:58.317
Do you begin to see now
the levels of spiritual enlightenment

11:58.384 --> 12:00.486
that you can achieve without marijuana?

12:00.753 --> 12:02.088
I do.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.891
It's funny, I thought Tae Kwon Do
would have more kicking.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.359
Well, it does.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.397
But you're about to learn
that the most powerful leg is the mind.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.834
Thank you, Tae Kwon Douglas.

12:15.801 --> 12:16.836
You're most welcome.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.006
Your journey of self-discovery has begun.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.242
Hey, that reminds me,

12:23.742 --> 12:26.412
we're all gonna get high
and see a Journey cover band tonight.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.013
You wanna come?

12:29.815 --> 12:31.484
I can leave you a ticket at will call.

12:39.892 --> 12:40.860
Hey, everybody.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.194
[all] Hey.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.929
So, my dad.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.865
He loved pot.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.366
-Oh, yeah.
-We all do.

12:48.167 --> 12:52.271
I used to joke that he considered
the Jack Heron strain his favorite child.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.107
And why wouldn't he?

12:55.441 --> 12:58.944
It didn't get its feelings hurt
when he forgot to come home for Hanukkah.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.314
Or 1997.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.284
So, this...

13:06.519 --> 13:09.221
-This is his true legacy.
-[all] Yeah.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.789
-[man 1] Yeah, it is.
-[man 2] Yeah.

13:10.990 --> 13:15.161
[Sam] My father was born in 1941
in Great Plains, New York City...

13:16.529 --> 13:17.396
So...

13:18.898 --> 13:19.865
my mom.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.002
She loved pot.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.336
Yeah!

13:25.037 --> 13:25.938
Yeah.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.207
My mother loved pot so much it hurt...

13:29.308 --> 13:30.176
me.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.948
Uh, when she showed up
to my first-grade piano recital,

13:36.015 --> 13:37.049
she was so high.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.051
[all] How high was she?

13:39.118 --> 13:42.288
She was so high,
it was commented on by all the parents

13:42.354 --> 13:44.557
and led to me being mocked
by my classmates.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.525
[all laugh]

13:46.592 --> 13:49.895
For a total of four and a half years
of my childhood,

13:49.962 --> 13:51.597
my mother was so incarcerated.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.266
[all] How incarcerated was she?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.502
Ooh, she was so incarcerated,

13:56.569 --> 14:00.973
I had a great time living with my father
and she's been resentful ever since.

14:02.107 --> 14:05.311
This guy's saying
what we're all thinking. [laughs]

14:06.412 --> 14:09.181
Yeah, and when I graduated business school

14:09.248 --> 14:12.051
and volunteered
to help run her floundering business,

14:12.117 --> 14:14.186
she was so ungrateful.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.021
[all] How ungrateful was she?

14:16.088 --> 14:18.591
She was really fucking ungrateful!

14:19.525 --> 14:20.893
[chuckling]

14:24.496 --> 14:27.566
But, Mom, I know you always wanted
a strain of pot named after you.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.971
Well, today, your dream finally came true.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.174
So, let other people smoke Jack Heron.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.542
Today...

14:40.079 --> 14:42.214
I'm smoking Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

14:42.281 --> 14:43.482
[all] Yeah!

14:47.887 --> 14:49.221
And I don't feel a thing.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.959
[Sam] Ah, my dad.

14:55.094 --> 14:55.995
So, this...

14:57.129 --> 14:59.198
This is his true legacy.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.306
[Dank & Dabby chuckling]

15:07.973 --> 15:09.475
Look at it.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.078
It's like a marijuana boner.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.581
-Oh!
-Oh...

15:16.181 --> 15:18.918
-Yeah, it almost came on us.
-[chuckles]

15:20.319 --> 15:22.421
Seems like an awful lot of work
just to get high.

15:22.955 --> 15:26.392
Yeah, but then when you do get high,
there's a real sense of achievement.

15:28.527 --> 15:29.929
What? I'm Asian.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.532
Now I see why they call it a volcano.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.036
'Cause it has a triangular base
and smoke comes out the top.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.539
Wow. [laughs]

15:40.606 --> 15:46.145
Man, I'm like the mayonnaise
in a pumpernickel genius sandwich.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.050
That sandwich is open-faced,
motherfucker!

15:55.621 --> 15:57.056
-It's okay.
-Okay.

And now I understand

16:57.383 --> 16:59.151
[Dabby]  What's up, YouTube?

16:59.218 --> 17:01.153
You're watching Dank and Dabby.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.621
[Dank]  Or are you?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.189
[both scream]

17:04.256 --> 17:05.457
Yeah, you are!

17:05.523 --> 17:07.393
-It was us the whole time!
-Oh, man.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.064
Today we're on location in the grow room
of Ruth's Alternative Caring.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.532
I bet you're wondering
what's up with this green light.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.101
Which brings us to our guest.

17:16.167 --> 17:20.204
He's a highly skilled marijuana grower
and he looks like white Jesus.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.711
His last movie is due back at Redbox
this week.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.214
Please give a warm Dank and Dabby welcome
to Pete.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.651
Hey, guys.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.121
-Hey, Pete. Thanks for joining us.
-No, it's my pleasure.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.791
I'm not ribbed for your pleasure.
What's up with this light?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.828
Well, at this stage in the growth cycle,

17:43.095 --> 17:45.798
cannabis plants need to be kept
in darkness for 12 hours.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.167
Twelve hours asleep, twelve hours awake.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.203
Yeah, that seems like
a lot of time to be awake.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.775
Uh, anyway,
what we do come harvest time is--

17:56.842 --> 18:00.746
Okay, let's cut the bullshit, Pete.
When can we smoke these bad boys?

18:01.413 --> 18:02.848
Actually, they're ladies.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.818
And these are the babies.
They're gonna need a few more months.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.454
Months? That's your story?

18:08.654 --> 18:11.590
Oh, people like you make me wanna puke.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.092
Okay. Okay.

18:13.692 --> 18:14.726
Calm down, Dabs.

18:14.793 --> 18:15.694
I'm sorry, man.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.431
Sometimes she becomes the Hulk
when she has a lot of green lights around.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.135
I-- I-- I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.137
Oh, bullshit!

18:25.437 --> 18:26.472
[yells]

18:26.772 --> 18:28.640
Dabby smash!

18:28.707 --> 18:31.310
-All right! All right! All right!
-Dabby smash!

18:31.376 --> 18:32.411
All right!

18:39.184 --> 18:40.152
Well, hi, everybody.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.453
-[all] Hi.
-[man] Hey.

18:42.154 --> 18:42.855
Um...

18:45.757 --> 18:46.792
Hi, Jack.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.262
Buddy, man, it's--

18:51.330 --> 18:54.233
It's hard to believe I'm--
I'm saying goodbye to you.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.537
You were... a fighter, you know?

18:58.604 --> 19:00.572
You were a poet, and you were...

19:02.407 --> 19:04.409
a lover, to many.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.211
Including myself.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.346
Hi, Bev.

19:09.781 --> 19:13.185
Hey, don't worry, it was before your time.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.223
I mean, everybody was fucking everybody.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.193
True that. Hey, Bev.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.398
Those were the days. [chuckles]

19:27.232 --> 19:29.501
You know, when it came to the cause,
Jack was--

19:29.568 --> 19:32.738
Was warm and generous,
and, most of all, he was passionate.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.875
I mean, Jack dedicated his life
to this plant.

19:39.878 --> 19:40.812
Adam...

19:42.581 --> 19:45.417
I know it sounds harsh
when you put it like that...

19:46.518 --> 19:51.456
but your father understood that cannabis
was about more than just getting high.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.861
I mean, he truly believed
that it could change the world.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.763
And we would change the world.

19:58.730 --> 20:02.534
He knew in his bones
that it was about helping people...

20:03.969 --> 20:05.504
improving their lives.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.675
And I want you to understand
that's what he dedicated his life to.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.812
And he knew.
He knew it was bigger than himself.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.515
Because it's bigger than all of us.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.618
You gotta always remember that...

20:20.819 --> 20:24.790
that dedication affects
other things in your life,

20:25.424 --> 20:26.925
the same size as you,

20:27.626 --> 20:28.493
or...

20:32.464 --> 20:33.565
smaller than you.

20:40.606 --> 20:45.377
So, come on,
let's all honor Jack's memory. Right?

20:45.744 --> 20:48.847
Now, we gotta follow his example.
We gotta keep fighting.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.415
We gotta keep educating.

20:50.482 --> 20:53.352
We gotta keep working,
but most of all, we gotta...

20:54.486 --> 20:56.421
We gotta keep loving one another.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.323
-[woman] Yes.
-[Ruth] Okay?

20:58.857 --> 21:01.326
Yeah, keep loving each other. Peace out.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.330
Thank you.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.599
[man] We love you.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.406
Boy, that was
an all-time top-five funeral.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.941
It was.

21:16.875 --> 21:21.346
I make fun of your generation,
but you guys really did make a difference.

21:22.347 --> 21:23.015
Thanks.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.350
That's what we were going for.

21:28.754 --> 21:29.788
You know I love you?

21:30.722 --> 21:32.691
Yeah, Mom. I know.

21:37.296 --> 21:37.963
No.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.332
I love you more than pot.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.906
I didn't know that.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.976
-And you were right.
-About what?

21:51.643 --> 21:52.978
When I die, wear a suit.

22:00.352 --> 22:03.789
Hi. I'm Maria Sherman.
If you're a stay-at-home mom like me,

22:03.855 --> 22:06.692
you're ready to burn that home down
with your family in it.

22:06.758 --> 22:11.897
Well, put down that gas can
and use that match for... Donna Weed.

22:12.431 --> 22:16.001
Donna Weed is a high-energy strain that
makes folding fitted sheets fun again.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.870
For instance, I smoked two joints
of the Donna earlier,

22:19.071 --> 22:22.007
and now, I've done two loads of laundry,
one load of dishes,

22:22.074 --> 22:24.443
Connor's California Mission diorama...

22:25.644 --> 22:27.612
Real bells! [chuckles]

22:27.679 --> 22:29.781
And, please, check out my pantry.

22:30.482 --> 22:31.850
It's fucking beautiful.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.552
It's just gorgeous.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.688
Look, it's so fucking organized!
Look at it! Look at it! Fucking--

22:37.489 --> 22:41.727
Okay. All of my jars are here,
stored alphabetically, okay?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.096
Then we got my tea-bag doodad up there.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.799
These are my olives,
organized by pit size, of course.

22:47.866 --> 22:52.771
And over here are my maple syrups
from east to west by Canadian province.

22:52.838 --> 22:56.408
And, of course, my pride and joy,
my spice rack.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.511
Starting with allspice, anise,
basil, chili pepper, cumin,

22:59.578 --> 23:01.079
dill, dillseed, dill weed, fennel,

23:01.146 --> 23:04.916
garlic flakes, garlic powder, garlic salt,
habanero flakes, Italian seasoning,

23:05.584 --> 23:06.752
and a big jar of bullshit.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.854
Because who am I kidding?

23:09.154 --> 23:11.790
These are only here
to be put in alphabetical order.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.892
I mean, I don't use these things.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.794
I don't even know what they do.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.996
What, I'm gonna spice something?

23:18.430 --> 23:20.665
I mean, I-- I order in three times a week

23:20.732 --> 23:24.002
and I've got a Guatemalan housekeeper
that does the rest of the cooking.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.638
She's manning the camera right now.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.640
Thank you, Rosita. I don't say it enough.

23:29.141 --> 23:34.913
I mean, all I do is just get high, eat,
and watch  House Hunters International.

23:35.781 --> 23:36.648
[sobs]

23:38.416 --> 23:40.152
I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.621
I don't know what's happening right now.
