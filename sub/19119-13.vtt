00:08.157 --> 00:10.022
<i>"manner of death, suicide."</i>

00:10.058 --> 00:11.870
- What's this up here?
- It's a bump on the back of the head.

00:11.894 --> 00:14.961
<i>I need to ask you
about those jars that she had.</i>

00:16.257 --> 00:18.789
<i>- Jars?
- It's an enhanced version</i>

00:18.826 --> 00:20.559
<i>of Agent Orange.</i>

00:20.594 --> 00:21.833
You mean like in Vietnam?

00:21.868 --> 00:23.739
Yeah, except this stuff's
been modified to absorb

in addition to</i>

00:25.265 --> 00:26.565
<i>its defoliant properties.</i>

00:26.600 --> 00:28.734
A load of dynamite arrived yesterday.

00:28.768 --> 00:30.379
They're keeping it stored
at a construction site

00:30.403 --> 00:31.769
just outside of town.

00:31.804 --> 00:33.082
They're gonna carve
a path for their troops,

00:33.106 --> 00:35.908
their machines, whatever they want.

00:38.811 --> 00:40.112
What the hell?

00:40.146 --> 00:41.445
<i>In the cage,</i>

00:41.481 --> 00:43.649
<i>that's when I saw my kin.</i>

00:43.683 --> 00:45.017
<i>They were all looking at me.</i>

00:45.051 --> 00:46.752
I don't know what's going on up there.

00:46.786 --> 00:49.121
Go to 'em.
We're right here waiting for you

00:49.155 --> 00:50.354
<i>when you get back.</i>

00:50.390 --> 00:51.848
<i>Let's not just steal the dynamite,</i>

00:51.884 --> 00:53.426
let's use it on that.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.127
<i>You helped them steal it.</i>

00:55.161 --> 00:56.695
<i>Look, I did what I had to do</i>

00:56.729 --> 00:57.945
<i>I gained the Farrells' trust.</i>

00:57.979 --> 00:59.543
You were supposed to bring us
information.

00:59.567 --> 01:00.698
Catching the Farrells,

01:00.734 --> 01:01.933
stealing some dynamite,

01:01.969 --> 01:03.201
that's gonna get you nowhere.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.703
Catching them in a terrorist act, now,

01:05.739 --> 01:06.871
that's a guarantee.

01:06.906 --> 01:09.106
You are no Bren'in to me.

01:09.143 --> 01:12.176
You'll be the death of this
ancient clan, Foster Farrell VI.

01:12.212 --> 01:14.165
We are at war.

01:15.182 --> 01:17.950
And it is a war that I intend to win.

A right change is on us.

02:23.283 --> 02:24.698
Can you feel that?

02:24.733 --> 02:28.170
Well, I can feel this 'shine
swirling around my ins,

02:28.205 --> 02:30.322
is what I can feel right now.

02:30.356 --> 02:32.498
There's a reckoning coming.

02:32.534 --> 02:34.793
And I can't have no more
children around.

02:34.828 --> 02:36.645
Got it?

02:37.296 --> 02:38.497
I need men now.

02:40.099 --> 02:41.299
We're with you, Foster.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.235
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

02:43.759 --> 02:45.002
How far are you willing to go?

02:45.734 --> 02:47.771
As far as you need us to.

02:47.805 --> 02:50.424
There's a warehouse full
of their war machines,

02:51.281 --> 02:54.045
set to come up here
and blow us all to hell.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.480
It's around the other side
of Mount Vernon,

02:56.872 --> 02:58.783
at the oldine.

02:58.819 --> 03:00.217
We're taking the dyno,

03:00.705 --> 03:03.254
and we are blowing it all up.

03:03.289 --> 03:06.496
We're gonna end this once and for all.

03:08.094 --> 03:09.561
The Bren'in know?

03:09.596 --> 03:11.697
Let me tell you something, cousin,

03:11.731 --> 03:15.099
our Bren'in, she is the most
good-hearted woman

03:15.134 --> 03:17.468
ever to grace this hill.

03:17.503 --> 03:18.870
But a good heart,

03:18.906 --> 03:21.272
in a time of war, can only lead to ruin.

03:21.307 --> 03:24.776
Now, from here on, I decide

03:24.812 --> 03:26.247
how we fight,

03:26.646 --> 03:28.813
and how we win this war.

03:29.479 --> 03:31.135
So I'm gonna ask you again...

03:32.795 --> 03:34.502
are you with me,

03:35.288 --> 03:37.088
or I got to do this alone?

04:19.665 --> 04:22.300
You're saying that Meyers
had her killed because, what?

04:22.336 --> 04:24.079
S-She found out they were
poisoning Shay Mountain?

04:24.103 --> 04:25.403
No, I'm saying I don't know.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.970
Maybe it was a mistake.

04:27.512 --> 04:29.374
Maybe...

04:29.408 --> 04:30.641
maybe they come in, right?

04:30.677 --> 04:33.077
They come in and... to take the jars.

04:33.112 --> 04:34.879
Things went bad, there's a struggle,

04:34.915 --> 04:36.548
and she fell, she hit her head

04:36.582 --> 04:37.949
on the corner of the table...

04:37.985 --> 04:39.495
- Wade, Wade, hold it...
- The M.E. confirmed

04:39.519 --> 04:41.887
it's her hair, it's her blood on it.

04:41.922 --> 04:43.733
They take her into the bathroom,
string her up,

04:43.757 --> 04:45.423
and make it look like a suicide.

04:47.090 --> 04:50.394
All's I know, I got to go
state's attorney on this. -No.

04:50.430 --> 04:51.875
Can you prove that the chemicals
in those samples

04:51.899 --> 04:53.764
came from Shay Mountain? No.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.134
Can you prove that One Planet
purchased them?

04:56.170 --> 04:58.737
- Or that they came from the state?
- No, no, but...

04:58.771 --> 05:00.137
but we have the photographs,

05:00.173 --> 05:01.785
- we got the photographs...
- On her phone?

05:01.809 --> 05:03.485
The photographs on her phone clearly show...
- Wade...

05:03.509 --> 05:04.887
- that the land is poisoned...
- All those show

05:04.911 --> 05:07.211
is that she took a hike, Wade.

05:07.247 --> 05:09.848
Now, look, I agree with you, I agree.

05:09.882 --> 05:11.750
These people are capable of killing her,

05:11.785 --> 05:14.218
and they are poisoning this town.

05:14.254 --> 05:17.055
But if you want to go after 'em,
really take 'em down,

05:17.089 --> 05:18.255
you got to get it all:

05:18.292 --> 05:20.992
E-mails, phone records,

05:21.028 --> 05:23.461
purchase orders, invoices, everything.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.064
And until that time, Wade...
listen to me, here...

05:26.098 --> 05:27.242
you got to be careful, right?

05:27.266 --> 05:29.567
You got a family to look out for.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.644
<i>We just know that he
was the last person to see her.</i>

06:17.678 --> 06:20.947
<i>You think that Gordon had
something to do with Haylie?</i>

06:20.983 --> 06:23.420
- No, look, look...
- And you think that she was murdered?

06:23.456 --> 06:25.389
We don't know.

06:25.425 --> 06:27.358
I need to know everything
you know about him.

06:28.071 --> 06:30.365
<i>You said he lived
all over the place, right?</i>

06:30.391 --> 06:31.822
<i>Yeah, protesting.</i>

06:32.290 --> 06:34.091
<i>Okay, he tell you where exactly?</i>

06:34.127 --> 06:37.362
<i>Um, there was that Creek River dam</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:39.730
<i>- in Oregon.
- Okay.</i>

06:39.766 --> 06:42.199
<i>- That fracking thing in Montana.
- Okay.</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:45.504
<i>A pipeline in East Texas
that he talked about.</i>

07:02.723 --> 07:04.021
I'm sorry it's late,

07:04.057 --> 07:06.057
but I got things to say to you, G'win.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.470
Speak.

07:14.069 --> 07:16.468
You know what my Fa is doing.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.437
That he's got his believers.

07:18.682 --> 07:20.148
Those numbers are growing.

07:20.182 --> 07:22.082
I'm afraid they're fixing
to turn on you.

07:22.119 --> 07:25.401
Foster, I can't, and I won't
be the Bren'in of war.

07:25.435 --> 07:26.507
I know you can't.

07:26.543 --> 07:28.163
So what do you want me to do?

07:31.112 --> 07:33.468
I loathed you.

07:34.316 --> 07:35.648
I've adored you.

07:36.211 --> 07:38.250
I've forgotten about you.

07:38.641 --> 07:40.725
Still, I love you.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.622
I don't know.

07:43.658 --> 07:45.324
I don't know, G'win.

07:45.862 --> 07:47.605
Come away with me.

07:48.629 --> 07:51.764
We'll find some other mountain,
raise our baby in peace.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.510
Everything's different,
I can't feel nothing

07:53.534 --> 07:55.348
but care for you now.

07:56.331 --> 07:58.000
For you, and him or her.

08:06.848 --> 08:08.393
It's a her.

08:14.555 --> 08:16.788
You know we can't leave this hill.

08:16.824 --> 08:18.608
Then I'm begging you...

08:20.161 --> 08:21.641
give it up.

08:23.858 --> 08:25.031
What?

08:26.322 --> 08:28.401
That Oak.

08:28.814 --> 08:30.670
It ain't caused
nothing but pain and death

08:30.704 --> 08:32.304
to anybody who's ever carried it.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.006
Give it up, G'win.

08:34.442 --> 08:36.174
I can't do that, either.

08:41.883 --> 08:44.283
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

08:44.318 --> 08:46.820
You got a minute?
I got your e-mail. Good time?

08:46.855 --> 08:49.389
- I could come back later.
- No, Wade, come in.

08:50.201 --> 08:52.424
Pretty much got,
everything tied up

08:52.461 --> 08:55.260
on the whole Haylie Grimes
thing, you know.

08:55.297 --> 08:59.328
A few loose ends, but,
I think I'm gonna...

09:00.168 --> 09:02.902
you know, have all the paperwork
in before the end of the day.

09:02.937 --> 09:05.370
Just thought I'd let you know.

09:05.407 --> 09:06.673
That's great news, Wade.

09:06.707 --> 09:08.376
Glad those issues got cleared up.

09:08.412 --> 09:10.275
She did have a few enemies, you know.

09:10.312 --> 09:12.745
There was that,
hippie guy, the eco guy.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.648
Um, threw the coal dust
on her at that parade?

09:15.683 --> 09:16.916
Gordon Jerrod.

09:17.706 --> 09:18.817
I don't know him.

09:18.854 --> 09:20.753
If you don't know him,
then, how come I saw you

09:20.788 --> 09:22.554
with him last night?

09:26.528 --> 09:28.528
- You following me, Wade?
- Yeah.

09:28.562 --> 09:30.462
Seems like I got pretty good reason to.

09:30.499 --> 09:32.831
- I wanted to loop you in.
- You wanted to loop me in?

09:32.868 --> 09:34.600
Yes, but I couldn't. State's orders.

09:34.635 --> 09:36.503
So this has got something to do with

09:36.538 --> 09:38.846
the fact that he's wanted by the FBI?

09:38.881 --> 09:40.706
He's a goddamn domestic terrorist?

09:40.741 --> 09:42.341
You think I wouldn't figure that out?

09:42.376 --> 09:43.509
He's just a confused kid

09:43.544 --> 09:45.010
who got in with the wrong crowd.

09:45.046 --> 09:46.879
And so we're using that
to our advantage.

09:46.914 --> 09:48.764
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

09:50.217 --> 09:52.619
We believe the Farrells may
have stolen some dynamite.

09:52.653 --> 09:54.398
- Dynamite? What the hell...
- From a construction site.

09:54.422 --> 09:56.234
He's been heading up the
mountain, infiltrating them...

09:56.258 --> 09:58.402
Stole dynamite? When the hell
was I gonna hear about it?

09:58.426 --> 10:01.293
Take it easy, the ATF is on it, okay?

10:01.328 --> 10:02.595
There's nothing I could do.

10:02.630 --> 10:04.429
It's federal jurisdiction.

10:04.466 --> 10:06.711
My job is protecting this town;
If there's any threat to it,

10:06.735 --> 10:08.768
I'm the first person
who's supposed to know.

10:08.802 --> 10:09.869
And now you do.

10:27.131 --> 10:28.498
Bren'in?

10:29.400 --> 10:30.801
Hasil.

10:31.427 --> 10:32.836
You're back?

10:34.475 --> 10:36.505
I know I've been gone for awhile, but...

10:36.542 --> 10:37.707
What happened to you?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.554
Well, I-I had a, I had a premonition.

10:43.182 --> 10:45.915
A feeling that-that something
was going on up here,

10:45.951 --> 10:47.391
and that maybe, maybe y'all need me.

10:48.226 --> 10:50.120
You plan on being back here for good?

10:51.756 --> 10:53.389
No, I mean, me and, me and Sally-Ann,

10:53.424 --> 10:56.493
we're gonna, um, have-have the baby,

10:56.528 --> 10:59.075
so I got to, I got go back down.

11:00.205 --> 11:01.671
As you should.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.187
- Right.
- Hasil?

11:10.442 --> 11:11.807
Big Foster and his boys

11:11.844 --> 11:13.587
- have stolen dynamite.
- What you mean, dynamite?

11:13.611 --> 11:16.312
What in holy hell they gonna do with that?
I don't know,

11:16.347 --> 11:18.360
but if we let them go off
on some kind of crazy plan,

11:18.384 --> 11:20.028
this mountain ain't gonna be
home to nobody no more.

11:20.052 --> 11:22.385
And you owe it to me
and your family to find out

11:22.421 --> 11:24.653
where they're hiding it,
can you do that for me?

11:26.412 --> 11:27.423
Yes, ma'am.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.852
I can trust you, right?

11:29.380 --> 11:30.620
Of course you can, for certain.

11:31.294 --> 11:32.970
<i>We ain't got much time.</i>

11:33.005 --> 11:35.418
Somebody's gotta do it,
it's gonna be me.

11:35.453 --> 11:37.432
Them roads ain't safe no more,
and you're looking at 20 miles

11:37.456 --> 11:39.669
through the trees by foot...
that's a day.

11:39.706 --> 11:42.049
- Probably two for you, old man.
- Well, we got to go

11:42.085 --> 11:43.804
over to that old mine...
we got to verify them photos

11:43.828 --> 11:45.528
that kid showed us with our own eyes.

11:45.563 --> 11:47.264
- Well, that's some...
- There it is.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.865
Look who's back.

11:50.634 --> 11:51.934
Mind if I join you?

11:52.647 --> 11:53.984
Been a while

11:54.019 --> 11:56.572
since I took y'all at black and red.

11:56.607 --> 11:59.023
Don't usually let townies sit in.

11:59.057 --> 12:00.878
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:00.913 --> 12:02.256
You know that was me that saved your ass

12:02.280 --> 12:03.613
the other night in that store

12:04.202 --> 12:06.249
when the soldier boy
was shooting at you.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.062
Thank you, cousin.

12:10.442 --> 12:11.528
You did that?

12:12.221 --> 12:13.197
You?

12:13.231 --> 12:14.664
I did do that.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.200
What the hell happened to you?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.366
Doesn't matter.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.902
Heard I missed some,

12:18.937 --> 12:20.636
some fine cavortings.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.038
The queen.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.073
- The ten.
- Okay.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.674
Heard y'all went on a...

12:24.710 --> 12:27.311
on a night run, stole some dyno

12:27.346 --> 12:30.009
from a, construction site.
That true?

12:30.813 --> 12:33.049
- Jack.
- It's true, we did.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.384
And who told you?

12:36.793 --> 12:38.522
Word gets around.

12:38.904 --> 12:41.057
You know.

12:41.092 --> 12:42.826
Cousin...

12:43.538 --> 12:45.328
you're hurt pretty good.

12:47.322 --> 12:49.265
You up to earning
your graces back with us?

12:49.923 --> 12:50.967
You know I am.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.347
You bring them Lostie clothes back with you?
- I don't wear

12:53.371 --> 12:55.504
nothing like that up here.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.540
He ain't talking about
wearing 'em up here, cousin.

14:28.566 --> 14:29.899
Look, the whole thing's simple.

14:29.933 --> 14:32.434
You just stick that right there, okay?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.135
And this here...

14:34.172 --> 14:35.671
that's what blows it.

14:35.706 --> 14:36.806
Okay?

14:36.841 --> 14:38.139
Stick it in...

14:38.176 --> 14:39.841
hook 'em up, you got your fireworks.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.210
He's right.

14:42.386 --> 14:43.865
Big building looks empty,

14:43.899 --> 14:45.480
but it's... it's full of machines.

14:45.515 --> 14:46.881
Military equipment. Helicopters.

14:46.918 --> 14:48.899
Just like them photos. Guards?

14:48.936 --> 14:51.253
I saw two guys. Didn't see no guards.

14:51.288 --> 14:53.500
One thing's sure, though...
something's going on down there.

14:53.524 --> 14:55.725
It don't feel right.

14:55.759 --> 14:58.793
Don't feel right at all.

15:08.539 --> 15:10.339
Jesus Christ!

15:10.375 --> 15:11.774
Hey, Sheriff.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.808
- Looking for me?
- Yeah.

15:13.845 --> 15:15.477
We need to talk, Gordon.

15:15.513 --> 15:17.517
Or Tim. Whatever your name is.

15:17.552 --> 15:19.493
Yeah, I figured you'd be
in uniform with handcuffs

15:19.517 --> 15:21.750
ready to arrest me,
but you aren't, are you?

15:21.786 --> 15:22.985
Why do you think that is?

15:23.019 --> 15:25.053
- 'Cause of Haylie Grimes.
- What about her?

15:25.088 --> 15:26.600
You think I killed her.
That's why you're here, right?

15:26.624 --> 15:27.756
<i>You are wanted for murder.</i>

15:28.926 --> 15:30.525
I had nothing to do with that.

15:30.561 --> 15:32.561
I know you know that,
or else you'd be pointing

15:32.596 --> 15:33.806
a gun at me right now.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.364
You know who killed her?

15:35.399 --> 15:37.432
- Is that what you're saying?
- We both do.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.735
We're dealing with some
really bad people here, Sheriff.

15:40.491 --> 15:42.705
I know. So why were you
talking to 'em last night?

15:42.740 --> 15:44.340
Who, Matt Meyers?

15:45.028 --> 15:46.820
'Cause he found out
about my aliases and my warrant,

15:46.844 --> 15:48.576
and he's threatening to blackmail me.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.614
- What for?
- To get intel on the Farrells.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.084
What about?

15:55.119 --> 15:58.019
They stole a bunch of dynamite
from a construction site.

15:58.054 --> 16:00.889
But he told you about that, right?

16:01.395 --> 16:03.491
Just know that Matt Meyers
and his friends

16:03.528 --> 16:05.727
don't know what they think they know.

16:05.763 --> 16:07.707
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That means that...

16:07.731 --> 16:10.966
I still have to play ball, or
else they're gonna turn me in.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.212
But don't worry.

16:14.498 --> 16:16.304
We're still gonna get what we want.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.440
What's that, exactly?

16:21.631 --> 16:22.602
You want proof

16:22.638 --> 16:24.809
they had something to do
with Haylie Grimes? I have it.

16:24.845 --> 16:27.582
I malwared their computers
about a week ago.

16:27.618 --> 16:29.850
The state, One Planet...
they contracted them

16:29.886 --> 16:31.865
to go up there and poison
their water and their soil.

16:31.889 --> 16:34.134
Haylie Grimes found out about it
and threatened to go public,

16:34.158 --> 16:35.724
call the state's attorney.

16:36.504 --> 16:38.326
Well, why don't you
just release it, then?

16:38.969 --> 16:40.995
Hell, if I did that,
they'd kill me, too.

16:45.485 --> 16:47.135
What do I get out of this, exactly?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.249
Well, you get all the e-mails
and documents it takes

16:49.273 --> 16:51.273
to save this town and that mountain

16:51.308 --> 16:53.709
and make it a peaceful,
decent place to live again.

16:53.744 --> 16:56.044
Same way it was
when you were a little boy.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.784
Aren't you gonna take your camper?

16:58.821 --> 17:00.850
That's not my camper, Sheriff.

17:01.461 --> 17:02.769
It's Gordon's.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.092
<i>You are starting to sound</i>

17:22.127 --> 17:23.826
a lot like your cousins, Hasil.

17:23.863 --> 17:26.230
Scared to death of something
you don't even know is real.

17:26.265 --> 17:29.128
I've seen those machines
with my own eyes.

17:29.163 --> 17:31.335
They're real,
and we have to do something

17:31.369 --> 17:33.237
before they turn them on us.

17:33.271 --> 17:34.625
I see it.

17:35.733 --> 17:38.107
You're siding
with Big Foster and his boys.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.891
I respect your wishes as Bren'in

17:39.925 --> 17:42.776
without questioning, but I ask
your ladyship to kindly consider

17:42.811 --> 17:44.525
- the fact that maybe...
- Hasil, I needed to trust you.

17:44.549 --> 17:47.016
I... - Bren'in, all that
I'm saying is that maybe...

17:47.050 --> 17:49.266
Just go. Just get out.

17:50.522 --> 17:52.088
Now!

17:57.936 --> 17:59.613
Yeah. I still don't understand
why you didn't talk to me.

17:59.637 --> 18:02.673
Actually, that was my call. And,

18:02.708 --> 18:04.820
I apologize for not bringing you
into the loop earlier on this,

18:04.844 --> 18:07.376
Sheriff, but we had some
S.O.P.'s that we had to follow.

18:07.413 --> 18:08.912
Yeah, I just don't understand

18:08.948 --> 18:10.962
how keeping my department
in the dark about this

18:10.999 --> 18:12.751
somehow makes the people
of this town safe.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.410
I mean, what do you think,
we're a bunch of idiots?

18:14.434 --> 18:15.831
We're all gonna go put this up
on InstaBook

18:15.855 --> 18:17.498
- or something like that?
- We all got to try

18:17.522 --> 18:19.033
- to work together on this, Wade.
- Absolutely.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.625
Which is why
I am officially informing you,

18:21.660 --> 18:23.527
and the entire county, that at this time

18:23.561 --> 18:25.494
we have credible,
actionable intelligence

18:25.530 --> 18:27.064
that an act of domestic terrorism

18:27.098 --> 18:28.832
is being perpetrated in this area,

18:28.867 --> 18:31.335
and that the target is
the One Planet office.

18:31.369 --> 18:32.802
Who's gonna do that?

18:32.837 --> 18:34.837
- A radicalized group.
- A radicalized group?

18:34.874 --> 18:36.952
What you mean, the Farrells
with the dynamite they stole?

18:36.976 --> 18:39.009
Did you hear this from Gordon Jerrod?
Yeah.

18:39.044 --> 18:41.345
They're planning on blowing up
the One Planet offices.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.947
He sent us a conversation
recorded on his phone.

18:43.982 --> 18:45.648
It just doesn't seem like their M.O.

18:45.683 --> 18:47.817
I mean, that'd be pretty much
game over for them.

18:47.853 --> 18:50.019
They did just shoot
an off-duty cop a few days ago.

18:50.055 --> 18:51.989
No, no, they did not... the ballistics

18:52.023 --> 18:54.191
have not come back on that;
That's not conclusive.

18:54.226 --> 18:56.292
It may well have been our vigilante.

18:56.327 --> 18:58.039
Okay, so when's this credible,
actionable evidence

18:58.063 --> 18:59.363
tell you this is gonna happen?

18:59.397 --> 19:01.365
Actually, we don't know that yet.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.400
We're still waiting to hear back
from our source.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.368
Okay, well, thanks for the talk.
And,

19:05.403 --> 19:08.182
keep me in the loop. Nice to meet you.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.297
Hey, Ledda?

19:47.613 --> 19:49.613
<i>1-2-</i>

19:49.647 --> 19:52.115
8-3-3-7-5.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.086
I learned about this site

19:56.121 --> 19:58.055
- from a Ukrainian 13-year-old.
- Really?

19:58.089 --> 20:01.057
Technically not legal
without the owner's permish,

20:01.093 --> 20:04.060
but this is the Dark Web, my friend.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.395
- You cool?
- Yeah.

20:10.469 --> 20:12.201
- What's this?
- Well, looks like he went

20:12.237 --> 20:14.337
up Shay Mountain a couple times.

20:17.039 --> 20:18.196
What's this here?

20:18.232 --> 20:21.980
Somewheres up near Route 53,
far side of Vernon Mountain.

20:22.714 --> 20:24.847
Yeah, it looks like
he made three trips up there

20:24.883 --> 20:26.282
in the last four days.

20:50.174 --> 20:52.375
Let the Circle begin!

20:56.448 --> 20:58.083
Our former Bren'in,

20:58.118 --> 20:59.686
Lady Ray...

21:00.451 --> 21:02.486
her spirit is among us.

21:03.070 --> 21:05.875
Her message was, and always will be:

21:05.911 --> 21:08.892
We must not become the evil we deplore.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.928
We must continue to live
as we always have...

21:12.652 --> 21:14.897
as warriors of peace...

21:14.932 --> 21:18.801
not initiators of violence and hatred.

21:19.455 --> 21:21.637
There's one among us who does not agree.

21:23.075 --> 21:24.775
The one who killed our Lady Ray,

21:24.809 --> 21:27.676
and who still tries with all
his might to crush her spirit.

21:27.712 --> 21:31.114
Now, against my wishes,
Big Foster has stolen fire.

21:31.371 --> 21:34.183
And not just guns this time,
but dynamite.

21:37.189 --> 21:39.722
And he plans to use those bombs
against the coal powers

21:39.758 --> 21:41.290
to destroy their property.

21:41.612 --> 21:44.461
But remember, every time he has acted

21:44.496 --> 21:47.663
from bluster and conceit, he has failed,

21:48.019 --> 21:49.398
and lives have been lost.

21:50.036 --> 21:52.269
His own son, Elon,

21:52.723 --> 21:54.037
Shurn's boy,

21:54.073 --> 21:55.202
Tice...

21:55.811 --> 21:57.039
Enoch...

21:57.411 --> 21:59.386
an unbroken chain of misery.

21:59.422 --> 22:02.511
And I cannot allow
any more of us to die.

22:02.903 --> 22:05.409
And so I call
for the immediate banishment

22:05.903 --> 22:07.116
of Foster Farrell VI.

22:07.152 --> 22:09.318
- No!
- No!

22:19.397 --> 22:21.431
No. No.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.142
I hate to have to remind...

22:32.715 --> 22:33.943
our Bren'in

22:34.342 --> 22:36.346
that too many of our precious family

22:36.381 --> 22:38.848
have been murdered under her care.

22:39.287 --> 22:42.618
We lived on this mountain
over two centuries.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.954
And no, not always in peace.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.425
We paid in blood, dearly,

22:49.461 --> 22:50.727
as the Bren'in well knows.

22:50.761 --> 22:52.095
Now, we have seen photographs,

22:52.131 --> 22:54.897
and Hasil, he's seen with his own eyes,

22:54.932 --> 22:57.968
the terrible machines of war
and destruction

22:58.002 --> 22:59.670
they've gathered to fight us.

23:00.271 --> 23:01.925
And we've heard...

23:02.406 --> 23:03.717
that their attack is coming soon.

23:03.741 --> 23:05.575
Maybe in days.

23:05.611 --> 23:09.190
Now, they were gonna explode
our south ridge

23:09.224 --> 23:11.147
with our dynamite that we stole,

23:11.182 --> 23:13.482
and bring those machines,
drive them right here,

23:13.519 --> 23:14.683
to this very spot.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.887
Now, our greatest weapon is surprise.

23:17.923 --> 23:20.356
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah.

23:20.392 --> 23:23.359
So if we gonna live beyond this winter,

23:23.394 --> 23:26.529
and our kin yet born are to follow us,

23:26.565 --> 23:28.292
then we have no choice

23:28.327 --> 23:29.965
but to hit first...

23:30.001 --> 23:31.268
That's right.

23:31.303 --> 23:34.171
And hard and with haste.

23:35.606 --> 23:37.007
Now, wars are won,

23:37.041 --> 23:38.634
wars are lost,

23:38.707 --> 23:41.076
but in the end,
the stories are told by those

23:41.113 --> 23:45.481
who had the courage to fight,
and not wait for doom.

23:45.517 --> 23:47.550
Yeah!

23:50.588 --> 23:52.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:01.557 --> 24:04.667
I'm in agreement with
our Bren'in. This man's actions

24:04.702 --> 24:08.003
will only continue
to exacerbate our troubles.

24:15.380 --> 24:19.148
Bren'in, I am and always
have been a loyal supporter.

24:19.183 --> 24:21.718
But if half of what
Big Foster says is true,

24:21.752 --> 24:23.853
I can see we no choice but to fight,

24:23.888 --> 24:25.622
and fight with everything we got.

24:25.656 --> 24:26.789
That's right.

24:26.825 --> 24:28.657
Yes.

24:33.523 --> 24:37.125
When my boy, Tice,
died because of his darkness...

24:39.492 --> 24:42.077
I hated him with all my being.

24:42.961 --> 24:46.041
But when you failed to banish him,

24:46.077 --> 24:50.247
I felt it was the most fatal of
mistakes a Bren'in could make.

24:51.349 --> 24:55.518
He is a devil inside. I know that.

24:55.554 --> 24:57.453
But these times...

24:57.489 --> 24:58.822
might be the ones

24:58.856 --> 25:01.391
where a devil is what we need the most.

25:15.941 --> 25:18.141
Elders, what say you?

25:23.486 --> 25:25.971
The sentiments of this clan,

25:26.116 --> 25:28.201
and of we the Elders,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.253
are in agreement.

25:31.289 --> 25:33.556
Bren'in, respectfully, we believe

25:33.592 --> 25:35.892
there is little choice
but to allow desperate measures

25:35.926 --> 25:37.160
to be taken by these men.

25:37.194 --> 25:38.930
But on one condition.

25:39.825 --> 25:41.364
If you should fail in this,

25:41.968 --> 25:43.932
of if any more of your boys
get killed or hurt

25:43.969 --> 25:45.434
in this raid of yours,

25:45.470 --> 25:48.805
you will agree to banishment
without a Circle called.

25:54.017 --> 25:56.488
We will risk all to save this clan,

25:56.522 --> 25:58.056
but I cannot make a promise

25:58.090 --> 26:01.084
to you or to any of us
that life will not be lost.

26:01.575 --> 26:04.688
But if I fail
in destroying them war machines,

26:04.722 --> 26:06.471
then yes...

26:07.558 --> 26:11.928
yes, I will not dare even
set foot on this hill again.

26:13.131 --> 26:15.964
I will banish myself from this mountain,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.159
and from this clan,

26:18.537 --> 26:20.069
from that day forevermore.

26:20.105 --> 26:23.839
However, if we succeed,

26:23.875 --> 26:27.095
if I am able to make my way back
to this paradise

26:27.778 --> 26:30.279
and to all my beautiful kin...

26:32.150 --> 26:33.950
then things will change

26:33.984 --> 26:35.852
among us.

26:37.756 --> 26:39.489
They will change.

27:36.490 --> 27:37.704
Look at this.

27:38.792 --> 27:40.292
This is the old Greenpoint Mine.

27:40.768 --> 27:42.929
Dad used to work here, remember?

27:43.299 --> 27:44.882
Yeah.

27:45.732 --> 27:49.234
Yeah, we tried to get them
to clean up that sludge pond.

27:50.204 --> 27:51.604
Well, Gordon's been out there

27:51.638 --> 27:53.105
three times the past few days.

27:53.141 --> 27:55.040
You got any idea why he'd do that?

27:55.076 --> 27:56.776
No.

27:57.679 --> 28:00.779
Yeah, okay, well,

28:00.815 --> 28:03.082
listen, what I'm about
to tell you, I never told you.

28:03.117 --> 28:04.517
Okay?

28:06.521 --> 28:08.086
Gordon called the staties,

28:08.123 --> 28:10.423
told 'em Farrells are gonna
attack One Planet tonight.

28:11.212 --> 28:12.612
But I...

28:12.794 --> 28:15.233
but I think it's something to do
with this mine.

28:15.896 --> 28:17.663
Like what?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.400
Listen, I don't know, but just...

28:21.435 --> 28:23.536
I want you and the kids
to stay here, all right?

28:23.570 --> 28:25.003
In the house, until I get back.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.232
I mean that. You don't go anywhere.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.546
Hey, Wade.

28:34.195 --> 28:35.548
Yeah?

29:23.064 --> 29:24.931
That's it, down there.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.867
Where those trucks all were.

29:31.005 --> 29:34.240
You were right, I don't see any guards.

29:34.275 --> 29:35.907
All right, start digging right there.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.676
We're gonna go from there.

29:37.711 --> 29:40.212
Phil'up, you're covering us.

29:40.248 --> 29:42.515
Yeah? Good.

29:42.549 --> 29:45.017
Well, come on, come on, come on.
Get going.

30:06.941 --> 30:08.473
Something's going on inside.

30:08.509 --> 30:10.643
We're moving in.

30:29.329 --> 30:33.065
_

31:07.969 --> 31:10.670
Intruders, seven males,
about 60 yards out.

31:10.704 --> 31:12.605
Repeat, six-from base. Copy.

31:14.842 --> 31:17.509
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.134
Go, go, go.

31:53.948 --> 31:55.080
Shit.

31:57.884 --> 32:00.152
All right, everybody down! Get down!

32:03.758 --> 32:05.758
Everybody down!

32:05.792 --> 32:08.527
Get out of there!

32:08.563 --> 32:09.662
Trevor!

32:11.632 --> 32:14.532
Levon! Get out of there!

32:22.109 --> 32:23.942
Don't shoot! Please!

32:23.978 --> 32:25.211
Don't shoot!

32:26.079 --> 32:28.180
Hey! I...

32:28.215 --> 32:30.449
I give up! I give up! Don't shoot me!

32:30.484 --> 32:32.785
- Don't shoot me!
- Barnabis! Barna...

32:36.723 --> 32:38.022
Shit!

32:38.058 --> 32:39.290
Goddamn it!

32:39.326 --> 32:41.626
That's it, come on, boy. Come on.

32:41.662 --> 32:43.395
Come on, boy. I gotcha.

32:50.704 --> 32:53.538
Come on! Get up!
Come on, cut that light!

33:08.855 --> 33:10.588
Come on.

33:17.432 --> 33:20.098
Hold up! Stop!

33:20.134 --> 33:23.269
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

33:27.751 --> 33:29.196
- Don't shoot. I'm not hereto arrest you.
- Whatcha doing?

33:29.220 --> 33:31.074
- I'm here to help...
- You ain't helpin' nobody.

33:31.098 --> 33:32.733
Get back in your car.
Don't you touch him.

33:32.757 --> 33:35.691
Stop! Stop! Stop! Fa, wait! Wait!

33:35.727 --> 33:38.121
- You want to die? You want to die?
- I trust him!

33:38.145 --> 33:40.905
He's dying! He's dying. I trust him.

33:40.931 --> 33:42.130
<i>I trust him! Come on!</i>

33:42.154 --> 33:43.887
- Look. Look.
- Come on.

33:43.913 --> 33:45.613
- Okay?
- All right, come on, come on.

33:45.647 --> 33:47.914
- What'd he...?
- He just got shot.

33:47.951 --> 33:51.685
Okay, we can stem the bleeding,

33:51.721 --> 33:52.965
but we got to get him to a doctor.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.899
- No hospitals.
- No, no, no, I'm gonna get him to someone

33:54.923 --> 33:56.940
who can help him, but if we
leave him here he's gonna die.

33:56.964 --> 33:58.257
Y'all carry him.

33:58.291 --> 34:00.394
- Carry him to my car.
- Come on, then.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.663
Come on.

34:05.384 --> 34:07.234
Here. You need
to put pressure here, okay?

34:07.269 --> 34:09.029
Here, get your hands on there.
Keep pressure.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.552
Okay, listen to me. There's only one way

34:13.576 --> 34:15.152
you're gonna get out of here
alive, okay?

34:15.177 --> 34:17.277
Leave your bikes; Stay off the roads.

34:17.313 --> 34:19.324
You need to go around the sluice
down into that valley.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.989
Then you'll get your way
to Shay Mountain.

34:22.684 --> 34:25.362
Sheriff. Thank you.

34:25.398 --> 34:26.853
Yeah.

34:29.742 --> 34:31.309
Let's move!

34:32.101 --> 34:33.311
<i>Ledda, Ledda, it's Wade, here.</i>

34:33.346 --> 34:36.713
Okay? Listen to me, I need you
to call your friend Polly.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.614
Okay? The nurse, just... call her,

34:38.652 --> 34:40.262
wake her up, get her over
to our house right now.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.786
I got a kid dying on me here, okay?

34:41.822 --> 34:44.021
Just call her,
get her over there right now.

34:59.539 --> 35:01.836
I've seen this before.

35:03.942 --> 35:06.043
I've been here.

35:06.079 --> 35:07.778
I dream of this place every damn night.

35:08.246 --> 35:09.981
I, I dreamt of that.

35:10.016 --> 35:12.416
I dreamt of that busting up,
busting apart.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.653
And all them waters drowning everything.

35:18.023 --> 35:19.925
How many sticks we got left?

35:21.427 --> 35:23.677
- I got this.
- All right. You?

35:24.264 --> 35:25.762
Yeah, I got a couple.

35:25.798 --> 35:27.998
Okay. Follow me.

35:35.038 --> 35:38.009
I got no idea how long this will burn.

35:38.043 --> 35:40.277
But you guys, you're going back.

35:40.313 --> 35:42.777
I'm gonna light it,
I'm gonna meet you there.

35:43.849 --> 35:45.884
Foster, why don't you let me do this?

35:45.918 --> 35:47.697
I'm quicker than you, old man. This is gonna go quick.
- No.

35:47.721 --> 35:50.755
No. I got too much blood
on my hands as it is.

35:50.789 --> 35:52.267
If anybody else ain't gonna
make it back alive,

35:52.291 --> 35:55.659
it's gonna be me, not you two boys.

36:35.313 --> 36:38.548
Fa! Fa!

36:40.875 --> 36:42.873
- Got you, Fa.
- Fa?

36:42.909 --> 36:45.742
Fa!

36:46.304 --> 36:47.878
You all right?

36:50.528 --> 36:53.021
It weren't enough to bust the dam.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.521
All right, come on.

36:56.556 --> 36:58.893
No, no, no, no, no.
Go on, go on, go on.

36:58.987 --> 37:00.418
Get up in them woods. All right?

37:00.454 --> 37:01.798
Spend the night,
you can walk from theres.

37:01.822 --> 37:03.133
What are you talking about? Let's go.

37:03.157 --> 37:04.867
- What about you?
- No, I can't. I cannot go.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.625
- Can't leave you here.
- I cannot go.

37:06.661 --> 37:08.427
You know that.

37:08.463 --> 37:11.030
All right? Get going. Go on.

37:12.335 --> 37:13.666
Look.

37:14.146 --> 37:15.501
Look!

37:21.541 --> 37:23.909
That's Elon.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.277
That's Elon.

37:27.076 --> 37:28.581
Elon?

37:28.963 --> 37:31.117
Hey! Elon!

37:31.152 --> 37:32.418
- Hi, boy!
- Hey.

37:32.452 --> 37:34.586
Look! Hey, hey! It's me!

37:34.621 --> 37:36.655
It's me, you got to get off there, okay?

37:36.690 --> 37:38.535
- You got to get away from there!
- Wait, wait. Fa.

37:38.559 --> 37:40.358
It's okay. It's okay.

37:40.394 --> 37:42.128
He was there.

37:42.163 --> 37:44.496
He was in my dream, too.

37:46.733 --> 37:48.099
We got to go.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.902
We got to go, now.

37:49.936 --> 37:51.771
No, now! Come on! Fa!

37:51.806 --> 37:54.072
- Let's go!
- We got to go, come on. Come on.

37:54.108 --> 37:55.541
That's it.

38:20.534 --> 38:22.300
Jesus.

38:22.335 --> 38:24.436
We need to go. Now!

38:24.472 --> 38:26.806
Let's go! Let's go! Go, go! Move!

38:39.119 --> 38:42.655
Thank you, thank you.

38:42.690 --> 38:46.257
Elon. Elon, thank you.

38:46.293 --> 38:49.461
<i>Thank you, Elon.</i>

38:53.501 --> 38:57.036
Sheriff, what are you gonna do about it?

39:07.981 --> 39:10.849
FEMA is calling
the worst coal slurry disaster

39:10.885 --> 39:14.586
in three decades, spilling,
literally, billions of gallons

39:14.621 --> 39:17.088
of black waste water across 53

39:17.125 --> 39:19.090
and into the Greenpoint Creek.

39:19.126 --> 39:20.960
The cause of the impoundment dam break

39:20.994 --> 39:22.594
has not been verified at this time,

39:22.630 --> 39:24.273
but the state of Kentucky
is cautioning everyone

39:24.297 --> 39:26.398
in Crockett and Louvin Counties

39:26.434 --> 39:28.501
as significant sludge run-off
made its way

39:28.536 --> 39:29.976
into the Black River, which supplies

39:30.003 --> 39:32.438
most all of the area's drinking water.

39:32.472 --> 39:34.184
Local and national
environmental groups... -Polly.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.419
Say they have been warning
that the manmade slurry pond

39:36.443 --> 39:37.943
was unsafe.

39:37.978 --> 39:40.012
And now this,
from a former big coal employee

39:40.047 --> 39:41.679
turned whistleblower.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.449
For many years, One Planet Resources

39:43.483 --> 39:45.483
has illegally covered up dozens

39:45.519 --> 39:46.997
of major safety violations
at Greenpoint Mine.

39:47.021 --> 39:49.288
There are also unconfirmed reports

39:49.322 --> 39:51.322
from nearby residents that gunfire

39:51.358 --> 39:53.458
was exchanged last night

39:53.494 --> 39:55.494
between the private security
firm hired to guard

39:55.530 --> 39:58.197
the company's warehouse
and an unknown group,

39:58.231 --> 40:00.632
but apparently, any evidence of this

40:00.668 --> 40:02.367
would've been washed away in the flood,

40:02.402 --> 40:03.835
authorities are now telling us.

40:03.871 --> 40:05.905
There are also reports on Twitter

40:05.940 --> 40:07.151
that this may have been the work

40:07.175 --> 40:09.208
of an eco-terrorist organization

40:09.242 --> 40:13.445
intent on stopping
mountaintop removal projects

40:13.481 --> 40:15.213
in Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia.

40:15.248 --> 40:17.583
So far, only
one death has been reported,

40:17.617 --> 40:20.318
the body of a young boy
discovered earlier this morning,

40:20.353 --> 40:22.054
but his identity
has yet to be determined.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.521
Again, we're reporting

40:23.557 --> 40:25.557
that local and federal
health officials...

40:25.592 --> 40:27.193
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

40:27.228 --> 40:28.994
Can I have a word with you?

40:29.030 --> 40:30.728
Not to drink their tap water

40:30.764 --> 40:33.898
until further notice. And FEMA crews...

40:49.182 --> 40:51.003
You know what this is?

40:53.019 --> 40:55.420
No. - It was found
at a crime scene on Route 99,

40:55.456 --> 40:57.188
where the Farrells
attacked that prison bus?

40:57.224 --> 40:59.757
I'm told it has your fingerprints on it.

40:59.793 --> 41:02.360
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:02.963 --> 41:04.896
Wade Houghton, you are
officially suspended

41:04.931 --> 41:06.931
from your duties
as sheriff of Crockett County

41:06.967 --> 41:08.800
in the state of Kentucky.

41:08.835 --> 41:10.613
And I'm taking this map
to the state's attorney,

41:10.637 --> 41:12.215
and they'll be starting
an investigation,

41:12.239 --> 41:14.827
so you might want to call a lawyer.

41:17.411 --> 41:19.139
Any questions?

41:21.949 --> 41:23.282
You're done, Wade.

41:23.317 --> 41:25.251
Nice knowing you.

41:59.519 --> 42:01.119
Ledda?

42:01.155 --> 42:02.954
Yeah.

42:05.492 --> 42:07.659
We got to get him to the hospital.

42:07.695 --> 42:10.228
Wade said that we can't,
he'll go to jail.

42:10.264 --> 42:13.164
If we don't, he's gonna die.

42:13.199 --> 42:15.333
Okay.

42:30.445 --> 42:33.518
Yeah, I need an ambulance...

42:33.554 --> 42:35.353
<i>And as I so warned,</i>

42:35.389 --> 42:37.523
three of us have perished.

42:37.557 --> 42:39.724
Four.

42:39.760 --> 42:43.795
Trevor Shay, Barnabis McGintuk,

42:43.831 --> 42:46.164
Levon Farrell and Hasil Farrell.

42:47.934 --> 42:49.745
Their bodies will never
be buried on this mountain.

42:49.769 --> 42:53.539
And so I call again for
this man's immediate banishment!

42:57.010 --> 42:58.577
No! No!

43:01.523 --> 43:03.273
It's true.

43:04.442 --> 43:07.085
I failed to bring all those boys home.

43:07.121 --> 43:09.655
I made a promise to this family,

43:09.690 --> 43:12.257
that if I did not destroy
their war machines,

43:12.891 --> 43:14.905
then I would never return.

43:16.498 --> 43:21.733
And when our boys, they lay
there, all bloody and dead...

43:23.269 --> 43:26.889
I believed that I would
never see this place again.

43:28.842 --> 43:33.313
But then, in our most dire hour,

43:34.650 --> 43:36.581
I saw him.

43:37.969 --> 43:39.947
Standing there, above us.

43:41.201 --> 43:43.088
My boy.

43:43.570 --> 43:45.556
My beloved Elon.

43:46.860 --> 43:48.893
He came to save us,

43:48.929 --> 43:52.697
and I knew right then,
that the old fathers' Prophecy,

43:52.733 --> 43:54.699
it was true all along.

43:54.735 --> 43:56.929
That our Elon,

43:57.405 --> 44:00.938
he is and he was the Returned
come to save us.

44:00.974 --> 44:03.442
And save us he did.

44:06.416 --> 44:08.012
I saw him, too.

44:08.467 --> 44:11.817
I saw Elon with my own eyes.

44:12.315 --> 44:14.338
So did Lil Foster.

44:15.088 --> 44:16.688
I made another promise.

44:17.362 --> 44:19.391
That if we were to succeed,

44:19.427 --> 44:21.960
then there would be changes made.

44:22.692 --> 44:25.664
That Oak was passed to my former wife

44:25.699 --> 44:27.632
- because of my supposed death.
- Enough.

44:28.425 --> 44:30.302
- I said banish this man!
- I don't know.

44:30.336 --> 44:34.106
When I saw Elon there,
in that hell of coal,

44:34.396 --> 44:37.643
I knew that that Oak

44:38.786 --> 44:40.545
is rightfully mine.

44:43.617 --> 44:45.818
I am still the Bren'in
of this clan, Foster.

44:45.853 --> 44:47.585
You ain't the Bren'in no more.

44:47.621 --> 44:49.166
And I decide who to pass this Oak to...

44:49.190 --> 44:51.923
I am the rightful Bren'in.
And that is my Oak.

44:51.958 --> 44:53.992
- Whatever time I choose.
- That is my Oak!

44:54.027 --> 44:55.893
- And I've decided...
- That Oak is mine!

44:55.929 --> 44:57.128
Listen to me!

45:00.501 --> 45:02.800
You listen to me!

45:02.836 --> 45:05.838
I hereby pass this staff to
the one most fitting to lead us.

45:05.873 --> 45:07.436
You can't do that.

45:08.074 --> 45:09.875
The father of my child.

45:09.909 --> 45:11.409
Can't do that.

45:11.445 --> 45:13.010
Foster Farrell VIII!

45:14.614 --> 45:16.148
You can't do that!

45:18.117 --> 45:21.052
You can't do that!

45:24.592 --> 45:27.358
Stop! No, stop!

45:27.393 --> 45:30.195
Stop!

45:33.434 --> 45:36.101
Stop!

45:36.135 --> 45:41.940
This Oak has been our ruin!
