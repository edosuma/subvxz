WEBVTT

00:00.927 --> 00:02.927
So we threw a blanket on him.

00:04.173 --> 00:06.173
We also found a needle in the cab.

00:06.870 --> 00:08.870
My son Jay's not doin' too well.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.143
His girlfriend left him, took the kid.

00:11.353 --> 00:14.206
He quit fighting. That was a mistake.

00:15.217 --> 00:16.671
With Khalis Capital.

00:16.672 --> 00:18.672
We're the guys that bought King Beast.

00:18.765 --> 00:20.838
Look, my bosses, they weren't
happy with the fee

00:20.844 --> 00:22.844
you negotiated for your fighter, Alvey.

00:23.021 --> 00:25.021
So have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

00:25.048 --> 00:27.048
About the guy calling you
a faggot at the fight.

00:28.255 --> 00:30.255
Your dad's gonna hear about it
one way or another.

00:30.293 --> 00:32.293
Tell him before someone else does.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.520
I just got off the phone with Terry.

00:36.524 --> 00:39.081
A new guy's
gonna be moving in here with us.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.409
- Hello?
- Hi! Are you Cody?

00:41.410 --> 00:43.008
Yeah. What's your name?

00:43.009 --> 00:44.201
Kayla.

00:44.202 --> 00:45.935
What's the deal with this Kayla chick?

00:45.936 --> 00:47.451
Why do her numbers suck?

00:47.476 --> 00:49.021
Yo. You're late.

00:49.022 --> 00:50.894
I'm here. I'm ready to work.

00:50.895 --> 00:52.895
Glove up and meet me in the cage.

00:57.175 --> 00:59.175
I can't even feel you,
you fucking pussy.

00:59.312 --> 01:00.610
Fucking Ryan, I mean...

01:00.611 --> 01:02.217
I don't know what the hell's
wrong with the guy.

01:02.218 --> 01:03.810
I think he has someone in his ear.

01:03.811 --> 01:05.503
You're not getting the coaching

01:05.504 --> 01:07.504
or the attention that you deserve.

01:13.903 --> 01:16.032
What the fuck am I doin'?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.151 --> 02:45.285
There you go.

02:51.884 --> 02:54.019
Take care.

05:38.178 --> 05:40.045
Get down! Get down!

05:40.046 --> 05:41.580
Get down!

05:41.581 --> 05:44.516
Stop! Stop! Stop it.

06:24.991 --> 06:26.358
I'm here to see a patient.

06:26.359 --> 06:27.793
Annette Kulina.

06:27.794 --> 06:30.229
- Are you family?
- I'm her son.

06:30.230 --> 06:32.664
Go ahead, sign in. I just need
to see a picture I.D.

06:39.706 --> 06:41.510
There she is.

06:45.378 --> 06:48.347
Okay, go ahead and put this on.

06:48.348 --> 06:49.681
And you are going to head

06:49.682 --> 06:52.918
to the Geropsychiatric Center
down the hall.

06:52.919 --> 06:54.721
Thanks.

06:55.357 --> 06:58.057
All right. Good times.

06:58.058 --> 06:59.425
You want us to go with you?

06:59.426 --> 07:01.193
No, let me go see how she's doing first,

07:01.194 --> 07:02.394
check her out.

07:02.395 --> 07:03.695
Why don't you guys go get
something to eat?

07:03.696 --> 07:04.897
I'm sure there's a cafeteria.

07:04.898 --> 07:06.698
All right. I can grab you
something if you want.

07:06.699 --> 07:07.933
Yeah, I don't know.

07:07.934 --> 07:10.235
Just a piece of chicken,
plain if they have it.

07:10.236 --> 07:12.771
All right. Text us if you need us.

07:12.772 --> 07:14.000
- You got money?
- Yeah.

07:18.550 --> 07:22.620
Your mother was
brought in on a 72hour hold.

07:22.621 --> 07:24.989
A security guard witnessed her
attempting to jump off

07:24.990 --> 07:26.290
a parking structure.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.058
Jesus Christ.

07:28.059 --> 07:31.061
Police found an empty bottle
of sleeping pills in her car.

07:31.062 --> 07:32.696
We pumped her stomach,

07:32.697 --> 07:35.355
but she's still working it
out of her system.

07:35.967 --> 07:37.901
Is she on anything now?

07:37.902 --> 07:40.504
She's refusing any
psychotropic medication.

07:40.505 --> 07:42.573
Well, can't you make her?

07:42.574 --> 07:45.442
We'd need a court order,
and because she's not violent...

07:45.443 --> 07:47.063
She tried to jump
off a fucking building.

07:47.088 --> 07:48.013
That's not violent?

07:48.014 --> 07:51.516
It doesn't meet the criteria
for involuntary medication.

07:53.585 --> 07:55.542
How'd you know to call me?

07:56.254 --> 07:57.656
She asked for you.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.549
Would you like to see her?

08:06.798 --> 08:08.263
Annette?

08:09.301 --> 08:11.468
Your son's here to see you.

08:25.050 --> 08:26.417
Hey, Ma.

08:38.296 --> 08:39.501
I thought we were...

08:40.432 --> 08:41.633
past all this.

08:47.344 --> 08:48.803
You sick?

08:49.441 --> 08:50.642
Something happen?

08:57.716 --> 09:00.231
Can you ask them for my purse, please?

09:00.852 --> 09:02.854
They took all my stuff.

09:05.223 --> 09:07.258
Yeah. What do you need?

09:10.929 --> 09:13.131
II just want my... my stuff.

09:28.513 --> 09:30.214
What the fuck is up with her?

09:30.215 --> 09:33.139
- Who?
- Kayla. What's her deal?

09:33.718 --> 09:35.786
I don't know what you're asking me.

09:35.787 --> 09:37.852
Is she gonna sit on
her fucking ass all day?

09:38.623 --> 09:40.438
She has shows tonight.

09:40.992 --> 09:42.626
So? I'm talking about today.

09:42.627 --> 09:45.129
She can't be on camera 24/7.

09:45.130 --> 09:47.030
Why not? She's young.

09:47.031 --> 09:50.167
Bitch is always by the pool
like it's Spring Break.

09:50.168 --> 09:51.835
Hi! Do you need me?

09:51.836 --> 09:53.504
No.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.205
Not even a little.

10:00.278 --> 10:02.580
No room for a lazy bitch.

10:06.117 --> 10:07.937
- Ryan?
- Yeah.

10:07.938 --> 10:09.654
- Can we talk?
- Where's Alvey?

10:11.890 --> 10:15.125
Guys, can we have the room
for a second? Please?

10:15.126 --> 10:16.693
- Sure.
- Yeah. All right.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.024
Alvey's in Tucson.

10:24.969 --> 10:26.805
His mother tried to kill herself.

10:27.986 --> 10:29.740
What happened?

10:29.741 --> 10:32.741
I don't have any details. He
just wanted me to tell you that.

10:36.314 --> 10:37.746
Should I call him?

10:39.617 --> 10:41.219
I'd give him space.

10:44.389 --> 10:46.490
Joe's gonna take over your camp.
Alvey left him a plan.

10:46.491 --> 10:48.425
I'm... I'm gonna work with Dom.

10:48.426 --> 10:50.494
That's not an option.

10:50.495 --> 10:52.629
It's my camp. It's my decision.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.164
Lisa...

10:54.165 --> 10:56.133
- It's my choice.
- Yeah, well, I'm firing him today.

10:56.134 --> 10:57.601
Why?

10:57.602 --> 10:59.002
'Cause it's not working out.

10:59.003 --> 11:00.504
I like him. I think he's a good coach.

11:00.505 --> 11:02.039
Well, there's more to it than that.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.007
Like what?
Like the... the protein thing?

11:04.008 --> 11:06.191
- That's just one example.
- And you fucked him.

11:07.112 --> 11:08.780
That's another example.

11:16.627 --> 11:18.362
No, wait, you...

11:18.656 --> 11:21.658
It's your gym, it's your life.

11:21.659 --> 11:23.795
You make your own decisions.

11:28.030 --> 11:31.201
I'm just a fighter. Right?

11:39.611 --> 11:41.678
Hey, man.

11:41.679 --> 11:42.811
Hey, Coach.

11:43.715 --> 11:45.349
Lisa just told me about your mom.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.050
How's she doing?

11:47.051 --> 11:49.135
You know, not too good.
She took a bunch of pills.

11:49.136 --> 11:52.356
Fuck. I'm sorry.

11:52.357 --> 11:53.957
Anything I can do?

11:53.958 --> 11:58.195
No. No. I, I left,
I left Joe a plan for you.

11:58.196 --> 11:59.830
Hey, don't worry about me.

11:59.831 --> 12:01.398
No, Ryan, you got a fight coming up.

12:01.399 --> 12:03.400
I wanna make sure you're ready
for it, buddy.

12:03.401 --> 12:05.542
I'm ready, Coach. I just...

12:06.371 --> 12:08.044
Listen, II...

12:09.440 --> 12:12.090
I'm so sorry about the other day.

12:12.977 --> 12:15.913
What can I say? I'm a...
I'm a fucking nut case.

12:15.914 --> 12:19.049
Yeah, well,
I, too, suffer that affliction.

12:21.986 --> 12:23.560
So we good?

12:24.189 --> 12:26.624
Yeah, Ryan. We're always good, man.

12:27.063 --> 12:28.959
Hey, if you...

12:28.960 --> 12:31.863
If you need to vent or anything,
I'm around.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.300
Okay, well, you get with Joe
and I'll...

12:36.301 --> 12:37.601
I should be home in a couple days.

12:37.602 --> 12:40.404
- Okay?
- I'm on it. Thanks, Coach.

12:40.405 --> 12:42.306
You got it.

12:57.889 --> 13:00.524
I got the boys, with me.

13:00.525 --> 13:01.892
They're downstairs.

13:01.893 --> 13:03.594
You don't wanna bring 'em up here.

13:03.595 --> 13:05.596
This is where the crazies are.

13:05.597 --> 13:07.061
They'd love to see you.

13:09.968 --> 13:11.602
Did they go through my stuff?

13:11.603 --> 13:13.003
What are you looking for, Mom?

13:13.004 --> 13:15.906
- My cigarettes.
- No, you can't smoke in here.

13:15.907 --> 13:18.243
Well, I'll smoke outside.

13:26.584 --> 13:31.589
I had a reaction to some
sleeping medication.

13:31.961 --> 13:33.390
And the next thing I know,

13:33.391 --> 13:37.091
I'm being tackled by some man on a roof.

13:37.695 --> 13:40.999
II don't even know how I got up there.

13:43.139 --> 13:45.069
You brought a ladder.

13:46.601 --> 13:48.005
Yeah.

13:48.006 --> 13:49.854
You tried to kill yourself.

13:50.441 --> 13:52.190
I wanna go home.

13:53.244 --> 13:55.546
You're on a 72hour hold, Mom.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.547
Can't you sign me out?

13:57.548 --> 13:59.416
You need to be here.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.241
You need to let these doctors help you.

14:02.987 --> 14:05.489
I'm not really asking you
to do anything.

14:05.490 --> 14:10.060
I just want you to sign some
forms so that I can go home,

14:10.061 --> 14:12.335
you can go back to Los Angeles.

14:17.548 --> 14:20.003
What'd you come here for
if you're not gonna help me?

14:20.004 --> 14:22.011
Because you told them to call me.

14:24.976 --> 14:27.016
I don't remember that.

14:28.012 --> 14:29.012
Ma...

14:31.716 --> 14:33.584
You don't have to feel like this
anymore.

14:33.898 --> 14:35.252
Do you understand?

14:35.253 --> 14:38.722
They... they got...
they got new medications.

14:38.723 --> 14:41.392
II tried it myself. I did. It works.

14:44.062 --> 14:45.129
I'm tired, Alvey.

14:49.267 --> 14:51.336
I want you to please leave now.

14:53.371 --> 14:54.604
Okay.

14:54.605 --> 14:57.008
I'm coming back tomorrow.

14:58.789 --> 14:59.923
You get some rest.

15:02.013 --> 15:04.012
You'll feel better once all this...

15:04.971 --> 15:06.931
these pills are out of your system.

15:09.559 --> 15:11.022
Get some rest.

15:28.272 --> 15:31.274
Dom? Can I see you in my office?

15:31.275 --> 15:32.609
I got a class.

15:32.610 --> 15:35.312
They'll be okay. Just come now, please.

15:44.355 --> 15:46.223
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

15:47.592 --> 15:49.927
You're fired.

15:55.626 --> 15:56.773
Okay.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.068
Wow.

16:01.272 --> 16:03.039
Wow.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.008
You let Ryan know about this?

16:05.009 --> 16:08.145
Yeah. I had no idea you were
such a little fucking weasel.

16:08.146 --> 16:09.946
Come on.

16:09.947 --> 16:11.548
I mean, he knew all about us.

16:11.549 --> 16:13.450
I mean, it was... it was obvious.

16:13.451 --> 16:15.251
Don't sit. You're not gonna
be here that long.

16:23.961 --> 16:26.803
I'm sorry, Lisa.

16:28.299 --> 16:30.848
Come on. Things got fucked up.

16:31.402 --> 16:35.061
We were both drunk.
You know, shit... shit happens.

16:36.841 --> 16:38.275
And it's not the end
of the world, right?

16:38.276 --> 16:41.244
I'm a... I'm a good coach.

16:41.245 --> 16:42.819
No, you're a fucking cancer.

16:44.749 --> 16:46.516
I'm trying to help you guys out.

16:46.517 --> 16:47.851
- You're trying to help us?
- Yeah.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.753
No, you're trying to help yourself.

16:49.754 --> 16:53.658
You latched onto Ryan
like a fucking leech.

16:54.330 --> 16:57.327
He's got a fight coming up,
and I'm trying to help him.

16:57.328 --> 16:58.795
Yeah, that's not your job.

16:58.796 --> 17:00.664
Actually, you were explicitly told

17:00.665 --> 17:02.365
to leave him the fuck alone.

17:02.366 --> 17:04.667
The kid comes up to me like
I'm his fucking shrink.

17:04.669 --> 17:06.569
I don't... I don't understand
what am I supposed to do.

17:06.570 --> 17:09.807
This is your final check.
I paid you for an extra week.

17:13.808 --> 17:15.412
Fuck that.

17:15.413 --> 17:17.012
I'm not going anywhere.

17:17.013 --> 17:18.354
Take the check

17:19.282 --> 17:20.916
or I'll call the police.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.586
You're gonna call
the fucking police on me?

17:22.587 --> 17:25.444
Take the check and leave.

17:40.137 --> 17:42.506
This is why you don't let
a woman run a gym.

17:42.507 --> 17:45.575
No one lets me run the gym. I own it.

17:45.576 --> 17:47.043
You know what your problem is?

17:48.813 --> 17:50.814
You're taking this too personal.

17:50.815 --> 17:52.517
You're too fucking emotional.

17:55.887 --> 17:58.686
I could fuck shit up for you...

18:00.157 --> 18:03.191
so fucking bad.

18:04.228 --> 18:06.277
So bad, mama.

18:06.597 --> 18:09.906
There's so many
fighters here that aren't happy.

18:10.768 --> 18:13.404
And I can clean you the fuck out.

18:17.308 --> 18:19.743
Please don't make me call the police.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.316
Fine. I don't...

18:26.317 --> 18:28.418
I don't wanna go out like that.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.253
You know what I mean?

18:30.254 --> 18:32.555
It didn't work. We didn't get along.

18:32.556 --> 18:34.292
You know? We tried.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.641
Mama, we tried.

18:38.434 --> 18:40.631
No? All right.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.768
All right, all right.

18:49.006 --> 18:50.440
Good luck to you and Alvey.

19:01.485 --> 19:04.888
Yes. Obviously.

19:04.889 --> 19:08.158
I just wanna make you boys happy.

19:08.159 --> 19:12.228
Rohan42, you are a filthy, filthy man.

19:12.229 --> 19:15.498
Nah, ladies don't do that.

19:15.499 --> 19:19.469
Well... I might show you my tits.

19:19.470 --> 19:21.602
Do you wanna see them?

19:22.306 --> 19:25.241
Well, first you guys are gonna
have to show me some love.

19:28.813 --> 19:31.815
Thank you. You're so generous.

19:31.816 --> 19:34.740
Okay. You ready?

19:35.753 --> 19:37.487
Is that what you wanted?

19:41.058 --> 19:44.394
What... Hey. Wait, what happened?

19:44.395 --> 19:46.096
Can you guys hear me? Can you see me?

19:48.032 --> 19:51.501
Come on.

19:51.502 --> 19:53.703
Fucking piece of shit.

20:11.856 --> 20:13.446
Cody.

20:16.293 --> 20:17.658
Cody?

20:22.967 --> 20:25.107
Yo, what the fuck? She's dancing.

20:25.108 --> 20:27.203
- My camera's broken.
- So?

20:27.204 --> 20:28.961
So I'm in the middle of a show.

20:29.974 --> 20:32.842
So solve the fucking problem. I'm busy.

20:32.843 --> 20:35.412
You're the Boss, Cody.
What do you want me to do?

20:35.413 --> 20:37.647
- Use someone else's.
- They're all taken.

20:37.648 --> 20:39.816
Well, what the fuck
do you think we should do?

20:39.817 --> 20:41.974
- Buy a new one.
- Then do it.

20:42.753 --> 20:44.487
You took away the credit card.

20:44.488 --> 20:46.624
Can I borrow it, please?

20:49.126 --> 20:50.695
Hop up, gorgeous.

20:54.365 --> 20:56.500
You know what?

20:58.102 --> 20:59.569
Lindsay, go outside, get some sun.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.838
I'll be out there in a minute.

21:01.839 --> 21:03.406
I don't know how things were with Terry,

21:03.407 --> 21:05.175
but I don't like your fucking tone.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.744
It's almost like you're the Boss
and I'm the bitch.

21:07.745 --> 21:09.447
I'm sorry you took it that way.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.852
You know, I could fuck you
in your ass right now

21:15.413 --> 21:17.254
if I wanted.

21:20.591 --> 21:22.014
Say it.

21:22.727 --> 21:25.329
- Say what?
- Say I could fuck your ass.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.667
You could fuck my ass.

21:30.668 --> 21:33.471
- When?
- Whenever you want.

21:38.114 --> 21:39.382
Here you go.

21:43.948 --> 21:45.079
Hold on.

21:48.582 --> 21:51.121
Yeah, Kayla's done. I want her
out of the house tonight.

21:51.122 --> 21:53.590
- No. Why?
- Because I don't like her.

21:53.591 --> 21:55.692
- I want some new girls.
- She's making money.

21:55.693 --> 21:58.261
See? There you fucking go again.

21:58.262 --> 21:59.829
- I need a reason.
- No, you don't.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.731
She's your girl. Tell her she's done.

22:01.732 --> 22:03.466
Actually, she's Terry's girl.

22:03.467 --> 22:07.403
Yeah? I don't fucking see
Terry anywhere, do you?

22:07.404 --> 22:09.812
She's gone tonight.

22:10.174 --> 22:12.356
Do it or I will.

22:13.110 --> 22:14.511
You fucking bitch.

22:59.623 --> 23:02.025
You think it's okay to smoke in here?

23:02.026 --> 23:03.115
Ha.

23:40.856 --> 23:42.238
Is that a note?

23:43.132 --> 23:44.400
Looks like a note.

23:48.606 --> 23:50.540
There's nothing here.

23:50.541 --> 23:52.957
Why don't you guys go grab some dinner?

23:53.878 --> 23:55.279
Do you want something?

23:55.709 --> 23:57.747
Nah, I'll eat the chicken.

23:59.922 --> 24:00.957
Grab me some booze.

24:06.290 --> 24:07.957
I want change.

24:15.266 --> 24:17.898
Jay?

24:18.469 --> 24:20.371
With me.

24:21.906 --> 24:24.240
- Where we going?
- Booze, food.

24:31.248 --> 24:33.216
Come in!

24:36.320 --> 24:39.422
I'm a sophomore. Wanna study?

24:44.728 --> 24:47.052
Kayla, I have some bad news.

24:47.932 --> 24:49.555
What?

24:50.367 --> 24:52.536
You have to move out.
We're letting you go.

24:54.602 --> 24:56.228
Why?

24:57.007 --> 24:59.023
Cody wants some new girls.

24:59.677 --> 25:03.027
II am new. III just got here.

25:04.181 --> 25:06.238
He just wants to go a different way.

25:09.286 --> 25:11.587
- What did I do?
- Nothing, sweetie.

25:13.324 --> 25:15.748
God, I feel like I'm gonna puke.

25:17.027 --> 25:18.667
Can you change his mind?

25:20.631 --> 25:22.796
I don't think so.

25:23.734 --> 25:26.703
II can... I can give up my room
and I... and I can, like,

25:26.704 --> 25:28.538
sleep on the couch
and... and move my stuff

25:28.539 --> 25:30.840
- before any of the girls wake up and...
- I'm sorry. It's final.

25:30.841 --> 25:33.443
I will literally do anything.
He can have my money.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.777
And I'll... I'll fuck him more

25:34.778 --> 25:36.418
and I'll suck his dick every day.

25:36.419 --> 25:37.347
Kayla, don't... don't...

25:37.372 --> 25:39.649
Try... try telling him
you want me to stay.

25:39.650 --> 25:41.148
Try?

25:42.086 --> 25:43.519
Please?

25:43.520 --> 25:47.363
Please, Christina. II really
wanna stay with you. Please?

25:48.092 --> 25:50.294
Please don't make me leave.

25:50.867 --> 25:52.009
Christina, please?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.935
If you don't have the money,

25:58.936 --> 26:01.004
I'll buy your ticket back to Florida.

26:04.875 --> 26:07.257
I'm... I'm... I'm supposed to do a show.

26:08.045 --> 26:11.014
Don't worry about that.
You need to start packing.

26:11.015 --> 26:12.513
What? Tonight?

26:13.150 --> 26:14.848
We're leaving soon.

27:21.585 --> 27:24.120
Hey. Hey, man.

27:24.121 --> 27:25.555
My man.

27:25.556 --> 27:27.671
I feel like I let you down.

27:28.358 --> 27:30.092
How's that? Thanks.

27:30.093 --> 27:31.694
You got a fight coming up, you know?

27:31.695 --> 27:33.630
Your fucking coach is in Arizona.

27:35.766 --> 27:38.234
The last thing you need is another...

27:38.235 --> 27:39.969
you know, distraction, right?

27:39.970 --> 27:41.972
I've lived through worse.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.441
Cheers.

27:53.116 --> 27:54.782
Fucking...

27:56.353 --> 27:58.994
Fucking pissed at myself, you know?

28:00.257 --> 28:02.859
Should've just fucking,
you know, keep my head down.

28:02.860 --> 28:05.162
Keep my fucking head down.

28:06.168 --> 28:08.598
She did give you a couple chances, man.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.100
She did. When I see shit is wrong,

28:11.101 --> 28:12.401
I just can't keep my fucking mouth shut.

28:12.402 --> 28:14.218
You know what I mean?

28:14.972 --> 28:18.875
Ain't the first job that it...
that it cost me, you know?

28:18.876 --> 28:20.476
Hey, man.

28:20.477 --> 28:22.011
You're a good coach, dude.

28:22.012 --> 28:24.380
You'll find something better.

28:31.355 --> 28:32.820
Ready?

28:33.423 --> 28:35.322
Where you taking me?

28:36.059 --> 28:37.627
Burbank.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.229
We'll buy your ticket at the counter.

28:41.765 --> 28:43.747
I'm not going back to Florida.

28:45.002 --> 28:46.917
I thought your family was there.

28:50.879 --> 28:52.442
Where are they?

28:55.412 --> 28:57.427
They don't talk to me.

29:04.488 --> 29:07.925
Go put your bags in the car.
I'll see what I can do.

29:15.766 --> 29:17.872
Alvey brought us
to New York one Christmas.

29:17.873 --> 29:19.135
It was freezing.

29:19.136 --> 29:20.536
Fucking cold.

29:20.537 --> 29:22.171
What was she like?

29:22.172 --> 29:23.606
Well, she was a nice lady.

29:23.607 --> 29:25.441
Really damaged, breakable, nervous.

29:25.442 --> 29:28.344
I think Alvey's old man put her
through the fucking ringer.

29:28.345 --> 29:31.013
She wore a lot of makeup. Um...

29:36.430 --> 29:37.681
Hey.

29:37.783 --> 29:39.221
Hi.

29:39.222 --> 29:40.990
Are you home?

29:40.991 --> 29:44.561
No, Nate and I are in the Old Pueblo.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.229
Where?

29:46.230 --> 29:48.854
We are in Tucson, Arizona, Mom.

29:49.897 --> 29:51.133
What are you doing there?

29:51.134 --> 29:53.236
Alvey's mom tried to kill herself.

29:53.237 --> 29:54.776
Fuck.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.340
Is she okay?

29:57.341 --> 30:01.143
I wouldn't say she's okay.
I would say she's alive.

30:01.144 --> 30:02.778
I flew out with Nate and Alvey.

30:02.779 --> 30:04.413
Well, that was nice of you.

30:04.414 --> 30:08.184
Well, I didn't want Nate
to come out here and be alone.

30:08.185 --> 30:09.585
Have you seen her?

30:09.586 --> 30:13.490
No, she's on a psych hold, Mom.
What... what's up?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.592
Well...

30:16.593 --> 30:19.862
I need a favor, but II almost
hate to ask now.

30:19.863 --> 30:22.264
No. What is it?

30:22.265 --> 30:24.767
A friend of mine is in a bad spot

30:24.768 --> 30:27.003
and she needs a place to stay.

30:27.004 --> 30:29.305
Any way she could crash at your house?

30:29.306 --> 30:32.008
I feel like we've done this before.

30:32.009 --> 30:33.376
Right?

30:33.377 --> 30:36.078
No, this is different. She's clean.

30:36.079 --> 30:38.214
So my mom's not gonna end up in zip ties

30:38.215 --> 30:40.050
and my home isn't gonna get robbed?

30:40.530 --> 30:43.020
She's just a girl who needs
a little charity.

30:43.538 --> 30:44.621
Well...

30:46.523 --> 30:48.330
I don't say no to charity.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.428
- I know you don't.
- Yep.

30:52.429 --> 30:55.965
The key is under the motorcycle
tire in the back.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.633
All right? Byebye.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.240
Hey, it's me.

31:04.241 --> 31:05.597
Um...

31:06.476 --> 31:08.611
I'm just calling to check in,

31:08.612 --> 31:11.447
on how your mom's doing, and...

31:11.448 --> 31:14.050
You're probably still at the hospital.

31:14.051 --> 31:15.857
Um...

31:16.887 --> 31:19.221
I'm sorry this is happening
to you so close to your fight,

31:19.222 --> 31:21.724
but as we know,

31:21.725 --> 31:23.824
horrible shit doesn't really
give a fuck.

31:27.264 --> 31:28.829
I fired Dom.

31:29.746 --> 31:31.802
He went quietly. Sort of.

31:34.438 --> 31:35.806
I don't know what I was thinking.

31:37.674 --> 31:40.277
We never should've let him
step foot in this gym.

31:42.913 --> 31:44.845
We could've handled it.
You know, just us.

31:47.848 --> 31:49.808
Anyway, um...

31:50.253 --> 31:52.394
I want you to know I'm thinking of you.

31:53.123 --> 31:54.958
And if you wanna talk, I'm here.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.962
Okay. Bye.

32:16.980 --> 32:18.337
Disgusting.

32:33.296 --> 32:35.145
What are you doing? The fuck you doin'?

32:36.066 --> 32:37.066
I'm smoking.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.736
- You said we could smoke in here.
- Yeah, fucking...

32:40.737 --> 32:42.805
We're still eating. Put that... Come on.

32:42.806 --> 32:45.141
Does he do this?

32:45.142 --> 32:47.543
See, my father used to do that.
In between bites.

32:47.544 --> 32:48.677
Don't worry about it.

32:48.678 --> 32:50.446
You are so fucking lowrent.

32:50.447 --> 32:52.214
You really are.

32:52.215 --> 32:54.116
Well, maybe in this country, Alvey,

32:54.117 --> 32:55.818
but Cuba would disagree with you,

32:55.819 --> 32:57.953
as would many Balkan states.

32:57.954 --> 33:00.156
- The tinderbox of Europe...
- Fuck the Balkans.

33:00.157 --> 33:01.578
Will you put the cigarette out, please?

33:01.579 --> 33:03.325
Please?

33:03.326 --> 33:04.633
Please?

33:05.162 --> 33:06.562
- Thank you.
- There you go.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.307
How's that chicken?

33:13.069 --> 33:14.437
This chicken?

33:14.438 --> 33:16.238
This chicken's perfect, man.

33:16.239 --> 33:18.474
It's exactly how I like it...
zero moisture.

33:18.475 --> 33:21.410
Cuttin' weight sucks.

33:21.411 --> 33:23.846
It's not about cuttin' weight.
It's about eatin' clean.

33:23.847 --> 33:24.656
You fucking goats

33:24.681 --> 33:26.148
should try it sometime.

33:26.149 --> 33:28.784
I hardly call that eating clean.

33:28.785 --> 33:31.987
Hospital bird. Nothing clean about it.

33:31.988 --> 33:35.157
That's a boneless breast of death...

33:35.158 --> 33:36.432
and cholera.

33:47.671 --> 33:50.095
- Is that good?
- It's terrible.

34:03.620 --> 34:05.140
Give me a piece of your fucking pizza.

34:12.228 --> 34:14.029
That's so much better.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.974
Did she say anything to you?

34:24.975 --> 34:26.047
Why?

34:27.277 --> 34:28.800
Mnhmnh.

34:30.146 --> 34:33.013
I mean, she didn't call me
up here to talk.

34:33.617 --> 34:35.784
She wants me to check her out
so she can come back here

34:35.784 --> 34:38.059
and fucking try it again, I guess.

34:39.514 --> 34:41.271
She tried this before?

34:44.534 --> 34:45.601
Yeah.

34:52.393 --> 34:53.795
I was 15.

34:55.605 --> 34:56.938
Came home from the gym one day, early.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.872
She wasn't expecting me.

34:59.976 --> 35:02.834
30 seconds into the house,
I hear a crash.

35:04.114 --> 35:06.838
I run into the bathroom, and...

35:07.350 --> 35:09.351
she's on the floor
with a belt around her neck

35:09.352 --> 35:11.320
and the... and the...

35:11.321 --> 35:12.889
shower curtain is bent in half.

35:16.226 --> 35:18.895
I pick her up, I put her in her bed.

35:21.531 --> 35:23.897
She begged me not
to fucking tell my father.

35:25.535 --> 35:27.692
Said she's never do it again, so...

35:28.772 --> 35:30.862
I didn't tell him, you know?

35:32.748 --> 35:34.584
Like he never told me when he found her.

35:41.251 --> 35:43.520
The woman never had an interest
in living.

35:47.457 --> 35:48.838
She's depressed.

35:50.093 --> 35:51.794
They can try putting her on medication.

35:51.795 --> 35:53.385
Might help, you know?

35:54.010 --> 35:56.600
She won't take pills. She won't
take anything to help.

35:59.102 --> 36:00.469
Someone really wants to die,

36:00.470 --> 36:01.870
you... you can't get 'em off it,
you know?

36:01.871 --> 36:04.207
It's... it's a fucking mission.

36:06.209 --> 36:07.343
It's really the only thing
I've ever seen her

36:07.344 --> 36:09.346
give a shit about.

36:13.416 --> 36:14.864
Sorry, Dad.

36:26.296 --> 36:27.876
Which one do you think?

36:28.732 --> 36:31.506
Nate's is probably cleaner.
It's the one on the right.

36:32.235 --> 36:34.426
Okay. Cool.

36:35.071 --> 36:37.439
Kayla, it's only for a night or two

36:37.440 --> 36:39.431
till the boys come back.

36:39.843 --> 36:41.511
And I don't want any men here.

36:42.601 --> 36:43.712
Neither do I.

36:46.149 --> 36:48.481
You need to figure out
where you're gonna go.

36:50.153 --> 36:52.193
I'm gonna call a bunch
of people tonight.

36:52.822 --> 36:54.423
Do you know anyone in Vegas?

36:54.424 --> 36:57.926
Not anymore. No.

36:57.927 --> 36:59.294
I heard it's really awesome out there.

36:59.295 --> 37:00.869
I might just, like, go.

37:01.498 --> 37:03.219
Do some research first.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.735
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not, like,
for sure about it.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.471
I'll just see who's out there.

37:13.443 --> 37:15.216
Are you hungry?

37:16.279 --> 37:18.481
I can make you something before I go.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.098
Do you mind? I just... I forgot to eat.

37:24.814 --> 37:25.848
Let's see what we got.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.165
Fuck.

37:42.272 --> 37:44.406
Aw, jeez. You're breaking that out?

37:44.407 --> 37:46.008
You want some?

37:46.009 --> 37:48.375
Fuck, no. You want me to run
my head through the wall?

37:51.586 --> 37:53.515
We'll drink responsibly.

37:53.516 --> 37:55.517
Yeah, he will. We won't.

37:55.518 --> 37:57.219
- I'm turning in.
- Night.

37:57.220 --> 37:58.551
Hey.

37:59.489 --> 38:01.457
I want us to communicate more.

38:01.458 --> 38:02.725
Talk.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.494
Tonight?

38:05.495 --> 38:07.329
No, not tonight, you fucking smartass.

38:07.330 --> 38:09.832
I mean in general, you know.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.200
I don't wanna be on my f...
on my death bed

38:11.201 --> 38:13.817
not knowing what to say
to my sons, so I...

38:14.337 --> 38:16.194
I want us to work on that.

38:17.726 --> 38:19.142
Okay?

38:20.156 --> 38:21.836
You're an asshole.

38:22.492 --> 38:24.012
I'm going to bed now.

38:24.013 --> 38:25.814
Ayeaye, Captain.

38:28.818 --> 38:31.554
Fucking soap opera, man. I can't...

38:32.210 --> 38:33.355
I can't work in that environment,

38:33.356 --> 38:34.823
you know what I mean?

38:34.824 --> 38:36.881
Can't train in that environment.

38:38.428 --> 38:39.995
Families are like that.

38:39.996 --> 38:41.663
But it's not family, Ryan.

38:41.664 --> 38:45.601
It's not a family. It's a
fucking place of business.

38:45.602 --> 38:47.436
What the fuck is Alvey thinking?

38:47.437 --> 38:49.972
How you gonna run a gym with a
chick that you used to be with?

38:49.973 --> 38:53.175
On what fucking planet does that work?

38:53.176 --> 38:55.358
What fucking planet does that work?

38:56.646 --> 38:58.147
They figured it out.

38:58.148 --> 39:00.917
Have they?

39:01.698 --> 39:04.951
They've been with me through
a lot of shit.

39:08.391 --> 39:09.622
I guess so.

39:12.529 --> 39:15.865
- Can I be straight with you?
- Yeah.

39:16.838 --> 39:19.202
You know I've worked with
a lot of fighters.

39:19.549 --> 39:21.551
I've never seen...

39:22.505 --> 39:25.054
a guy with your talent.

39:26.142 --> 39:30.212
You got all the fucking tools, my man.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.477
But Alvey?

39:37.820 --> 39:40.123
He got you stuck in neutral, man.

39:40.653 --> 39:44.092
I don't know about that, man.
I'm having a pretty good year.

39:44.093 --> 39:47.410
You're getting by because you're
a superior athlete.

39:48.565 --> 39:50.538
II'm talking about...

39:51.034 --> 39:53.502
next fucking level.

39:53.503 --> 39:55.871
Alvey, knows his shit.

39:55.872 --> 39:57.372
I'ma... I'm... I'ma give him that.

39:57.373 --> 39:59.422
I'm a fan, man.

39:59.843 --> 40:01.543
I could acknowledge that.

40:01.544 --> 40:03.612
But he's stuck in his ways, man.

40:03.613 --> 40:05.781
He's living 10 years ago.

40:05.782 --> 40:08.917
He ain't tryin' to fucking evolve.

40:08.918 --> 40:10.319
He ain't tryin' to educate himself

40:10.320 --> 40:12.255
on the fucking game, man.

40:15.725 --> 40:17.860
I won a lot of fights with him.

40:23.566 --> 40:25.365
Well, then you're comfortable.

40:26.736 --> 40:28.237
I don't think you're growing
as a fighter.

40:28.238 --> 40:29.702
I'm just being...

40:30.340 --> 40:31.940
I'm being honest right now.

40:31.941 --> 40:33.941
I liked you better when
you were full of shit, bro.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.313
I think you're special.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.339
What?

40:46.956 --> 40:50.626
Does that make you feel
uncomfortable right now?

40:50.627 --> 40:52.094
You're special.

40:54.430 --> 40:57.499
I'm not trying to fuck you.
You're special, man.

40:57.500 --> 40:59.101
You know what I mean?

40:59.102 --> 41:02.068
I wouldn't be saying this
if you were just a guy.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.723
You could be great.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.649
What do you think I need to do?

41:14.284 --> 41:16.332
We need to change the game.

41:17.086 --> 41:19.752
And we're gonna do this shit together.

41:20.456 --> 41:23.058
I know you're a loyal guy.

41:23.059 --> 41:26.301
I know that. I'm the same
fucking way, and it cost me.

41:26.763 --> 41:31.066
The last thing I wanna do
is poach a fighter.

41:31.067 --> 41:34.726
But you are fucking different.

41:35.305 --> 41:37.873
Brother, I know it feels dirty, man.

41:37.874 --> 41:40.475
I know it fucking feels dirty.

41:40.476 --> 41:43.178
It is fucking dirty. It's dirty.

41:43.179 --> 41:45.914
You owe it to yourself, Ryan.

41:45.915 --> 41:48.885
Not many guys get another shot at this.

41:54.257 --> 41:55.291
Okay.

41:58.861 --> 42:00.630
Where do you think I can be better?

42:02.665 --> 42:04.633
I think you take too much punishment.

42:04.634 --> 42:06.569
You get hit way too much.

42:07.175 --> 42:10.038
We need to weaponize that right hand.

42:10.039 --> 42:13.342
You need to knock fuckers out.

42:13.343 --> 42:15.777
By the way, sponsors,
they love that shit.

42:15.778 --> 42:17.936
That's how we get paid.

42:18.581 --> 42:22.585
You knocking motherfuckers out
how we get paid. Right?

42:23.274 --> 42:26.402
In the short term, brother...

42:27.695 --> 42:30.225
we work out of Black House.

42:30.226 --> 42:31.574
Hey, hey.

42:34.163 --> 42:35.999
I'm already looking at spaces.

42:38.267 --> 42:40.458
You're gonna open up your own gym?

42:44.140 --> 42:46.041
My man.

42:46.042 --> 42:49.344
My man, that's my fucking dream, bro.

42:49.345 --> 42:51.246
My fucking dream.

42:51.247 --> 42:54.316
And I'm not talking about
that bullshit franchise shit.

42:54.317 --> 42:57.386
I'm talking about
we keep that motherfucker small.

42:57.387 --> 43:00.856
We keep it killers only.

43:00.857 --> 43:03.231
I'ma cut you in on this shit.

43:04.273 --> 43:05.962
Yeah.

43:06.275 --> 43:08.069
I'm gonna give you a piece.

43:09.265 --> 43:11.433
And you don't have to put nothing down.

43:11.434 --> 43:13.735
Nothing down.
What do you think about that?

43:16.139 --> 43:18.173
Let me get another round
when you get a chance.

43:18.174 --> 43:20.909
- Got it.
- What you thinking?

43:20.910 --> 43:22.709
Um...

43:24.669 --> 43:27.449
I think...

43:27.450 --> 43:28.918
Yeah, yeah?

43:32.522 --> 43:34.012
I think...

43:34.657 --> 43:37.192
if you were good enough to be my coach,

43:37.193 --> 43:38.683
you'd be my coach,

43:39.328 --> 43:40.768
but you're not.

43:45.668 --> 43:47.233
Be good, man.

43:49.193 --> 43:51.239
I'll see you around.

44:01.717 --> 44:04.020
We just have to get... get her back.

44:05.488 --> 44:08.671
Like an Amber Alert situation?

44:09.525 --> 44:11.026
Are we talkin'

44:11.027 --> 44:13.695
child fucking abduction, Nathaniel?

44:13.696 --> 44:14.830
Crossing interstate lines?

44:14.831 --> 44:16.721
Yep.

44:17.333 --> 44:20.135
I'm gonna get aa white van,

44:20.136 --> 44:22.471
unmarked, no windows.

44:22.472 --> 44:26.441
Nope. White vans
with no windows stand out.

44:26.442 --> 44:30.278
You gotta steal a Prius or something.

44:32.782 --> 44:34.416
You've thought about this?

44:34.417 --> 44:35.984
Of course I've fucking
thought about this.

44:35.985 --> 44:37.986
I've dug a fucking bunker.

44:37.987 --> 44:40.188
I have keys for you,
should you want to join.

44:40.189 --> 44:41.791
We're gonna get that fucking baby back.

44:44.727 --> 44:47.129
Amy loved you.

44:50.867 --> 44:53.674
She loved you once,
she can love you again.

45:06.349 --> 45:07.617
You're a naive young man.

45:10.953 --> 45:13.486
Okay, you freaked out.

45:14.690 --> 45:16.391
And rightfully so,

45:16.392 --> 45:18.393
because you were trying to be
someone you're not,

45:18.394 --> 45:19.694
which, I don't know if you know this,

45:19.695 --> 45:21.296
is completely impossible for you.

45:21.297 --> 45:22.954
But she loved you,

45:24.800 --> 45:27.416
and you just have to get back to that.

45:28.571 --> 45:31.254
She didn't grow up like us.

45:31.279 --> 45:33.108
On my best fucking day...

45:33.109 --> 45:35.424
I'm drinking out of
their garden hose.

45:38.915 --> 45:41.586
When did you become
such a fucking pussy?

45:42.985 --> 45:44.620
My formative years.

45:45.309 --> 45:48.437
I mean, I hear what you're saying.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.060
I hear what you're saying. Thank you.

45:53.609 --> 45:55.236
But I fucked up.

45:55.665 --> 45:58.698
I fucked up and I know that.

45:59.101 --> 46:02.304
And I think it's only fair

46:02.305 --> 46:04.473
to just leave Amy alone.

46:09.041 --> 46:13.348
What I don't want is to be
Maya's shithead dad

46:13.349 --> 46:16.251
somewhere in fucking nowhere California.

46:16.252 --> 46:19.955
That, man, that I am trying
really fucking hard...

46:19.956 --> 46:21.220
not to be.

46:25.061 --> 46:26.142
Well...

46:35.604 --> 46:36.604
Yeah.

46:41.510 --> 46:43.034
How is it?

46:43.379 --> 46:44.785
It's good.

46:45.348 --> 46:47.116
My boys eat a lot of oatmeal.

46:52.955 --> 46:56.458
Can I ask you a question,
and you'll tell me the truth?

47:01.364 --> 47:03.262
Why don't people like me?

47:03.799 --> 47:06.057
They do. All the girls love you.

47:06.669 --> 47:08.351
I know they don't.

47:10.306 --> 47:14.542
I love to make people smile and be fun,

47:14.543 --> 47:17.079
and I just feel like
I'm always annoying people.

47:17.693 --> 47:19.281
I just feel like people hate me.

47:19.282 --> 47:21.883
- Nobody hates you.
- Cody does.

47:21.884 --> 47:24.553
Fuck Cody. He's a loser.

47:26.756 --> 47:29.288
What do you want with a guy like Cody?

47:29.825 --> 47:32.961
- He's successful and he has money...
- No, he's not.

47:32.962 --> 47:35.298
He's not successful at all.

47:38.134 --> 47:41.404
He looks at me like he hates me,
and I don't know what I did.

47:41.926 --> 47:43.678
Listen, Kayla,

47:43.906 --> 47:46.041
if you're gonna survive
in this business,

47:46.042 --> 47:47.475
you have to protect yourself.

47:47.476 --> 47:49.177
Don't fall in love.

47:49.178 --> 47:51.852
Don't go looking for a new
father. He's not out there.

47:53.449 --> 47:55.356
These are not your friends.

47:56.619 --> 48:00.069
Good men don't sell girls.

48:00.723 --> 48:02.390
Remember that.

48:47.703 --> 48:49.938
Hey.

48:49.939 --> 48:53.775
Hey. Are you asleep?

48:53.776 --> 48:58.480
No, no. I am, I'm laying
on my mother's bed,

48:58.481 --> 48:59.982
reading her suicide note.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.318
Jay told me what happened.

49:03.319 --> 49:05.468
Yeah.

49:06.489 --> 49:08.991
Well, she knows what she wants.
I'll give her that much.

49:09.889 --> 49:12.694
I had a feeling she was up to something

49:12.695 --> 49:14.129
when she sent you those pictures.

49:14.130 --> 49:15.531
I should've said something.

49:16.103 --> 49:17.897
I knew it, too.

49:18.601 --> 49:20.035
Wouldn't have mattered.

49:20.816 --> 49:23.005
Did she say why?

49:23.444 --> 49:25.488
She doesn't wanna talk about it.

49:26.075 --> 49:28.324
She's probably embarrassed.

49:29.867 --> 49:31.981
What's the note say?

49:32.745 --> 49:34.415
Want me to read it to you?

49:36.986 --> 49:38.186
It's short.

49:40.956 --> 49:43.047
Only if you want to.

49:49.298 --> 49:52.767
"Alvey, please forgive me for this,

49:52.768 --> 49:55.170
"but I've passed any enjoyment in life

49:55.171 --> 49:57.478
"and did not want to be a burden on you.

49:58.207 --> 50:02.243
"My life was good.
I loved your father deeply.

50:02.244 --> 50:04.446
He was a better man than you remember."

50:08.717 --> 50:10.658
"My only regret

50:11.253 --> 50:13.488
is that you never knew
how proud of you I am."

50:15.391 --> 50:17.392
"I don't know why I couldn't tell you.

50:17.393 --> 50:20.930
Please find happiness
in your life. Mom."

50:21.602 --> 50:22.797
That's it.

50:27.536 --> 50:30.105
Yeah? Let me call you back.

50:30.839 --> 50:33.441
Yeah. I'm here.

50:33.442 --> 50:36.145
Bye.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.477
Hey.

50:39.248 --> 50:40.571
What's up?

50:48.557 --> 50:50.325
I found this in my bag.

50:54.096 --> 50:55.530
Thought you didn't have it.

51:00.169 --> 51:01.569
Sometimes I lie.

51:11.513 --> 51:13.314
Night, son.
