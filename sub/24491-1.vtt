00:17.224 --> 00:21.225
Which is, uh, why
it's always a good idea

00:21.227 --> 00:24.263
to, uh, personalize
your incentives.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.335
Uh, next, we'd like to give
you a little demonstration

00:30.337 --> 00:34.805
of some of the principles that
we've discussed here today.

00:34.807 --> 00:37.344
Um, enjoy!

01:36.237 --> 01:40.005
MultiCorp Industries, this is Catherine
speaking. How may I help you?

01:40.007 --> 01:41.473
Frankly, I'm not sure
that you can.

01:41.475 --> 01:43.074
Well, surely, I can be
of some assistance.

01:43.076 --> 01:47.011
My name is Gertrude Alan. I don't have
much time. I run a very large company.

01:47.013 --> 01:50.348
Well I understand, Ms. Alan, we're
all of us very busy these days.

01:50.350 --> 01:53.351
Oh, well, with faulty products like
yours, I don't doubt that you are.

01:53.353 --> 01:57.288
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Products have come to me damaged, Catherine.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.557
And how do you explain
such slip-shod service?

01:59.559 --> 02:01.827
Well, this is the first
I've heard of such a problem.

02:01.829 --> 02:03.461
Thank you for bringing it
to my attention.

02:03.463 --> 02:05.363
This is more than
just an inconvenience.

02:05.365 --> 02:07.298
Tell me that
you understand that.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.768
- I understand.
- Picture this, Catherine.

02:10.770 --> 02:16.408
Picture a middle-aged, slightly
frazzled, overworked executive, okay?

02:16.410 --> 02:18.909
And she comes in
just like she does everyday

02:18.911 --> 02:21.445
and she has her mug of coffee,

02:21.447 --> 02:24.516
and the mug has
a picture of her dog on it

02:24.518 --> 02:29.688
that's slowly peeling,
you know? It's faded.

02:29.690 --> 02:33.425
So, she comes in
and she hasn't had much sleep,

02:33.427 --> 02:36.927
she's just returned from
a long absence,

02:36.929 --> 02:41.599
and her department has just
gone to pieces without her.

02:41.601 --> 02:45.337
Everything's just fallen apart without her.
Are you still there?

02:45.339 --> 02:46.605
I'm seeing it.

02:46.607 --> 02:49.440
I'm 42 years old, Catherine.

02:49.442 --> 02:53.445
Ms. Alan, I'm I'm confident
that if you just tell me what ha...

02:53.447 --> 02:55.283
Once, I tried
to change things.

02:56.382 --> 02:58.050
Can you picture me with kids?

02:58.052 --> 03:01.385
They told me I was too old but
I, I was reasonably healthy

03:01.387 --> 03:06.627
so I thought to myself,
"Yes, let's see this through."

03:07.695 --> 03:09.030
And I...

03:09.963 --> 03:11.632
I just don't know...

03:14.101 --> 03:16.704
I'm sorry.

03:18.839 --> 03:22.106
Things were going to be
different, Catherine. Better.

03:22.108 --> 03:25.445
I wasn't going to work my life away.
I was going to be home more.

03:26.512 --> 03:28.580
But, no, not for me.

03:28.582 --> 03:32.016
All right. I just try
to stay busy.

03:32.018 --> 03:35.420
I focus on the task at hand, I
just get through it day by day.

03:35.422 --> 03:36.621
Maybe that will be enough.

03:36.623 --> 03:38.724
This could have been
a good day.

03:38.726 --> 03:40.592
- Why don't you tell me what happened?
- I opened it up

03:40.594 --> 03:42.861
- and it was all fucked!
- It's not supposed to be...

03:42.863 --> 03:44.862
Can't I just have
this one thing, Catherine?

03:44.864 --> 03:47.834
- It's not supposed to be like that.
- You can't help me.

03:49.536 --> 03:54.772
Listen, I can't pretend that I know
what you're going through right now.

03:54.774 --> 03:58.542
But you can rest assured that
MultiCorp will make this up to you.

03:58.544 --> 04:01.813
- How?
- Well, for starters,

04:01.815 --> 04:05.550
we're going to resend all your
product at no extra charge,

04:05.552 --> 04:07.518
and we'll even throw in
a few more on the house

04:07.520 --> 04:10.956
as a token of appreciation
for your business.

04:10.958 --> 04:13.023
Well, thank you.

04:13.025 --> 04:16.726
I really appreciate your
understanding in this circumstance.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.897
- Catherine?
- Cathy, to my friends.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.866
I'll give you a call
in a week's time

04:21.868 --> 04:24.568
just to make sure that everything's
been resolved to your satisfaction.

04:24.570 --> 04:26.637
How does that sound?

04:26.639 --> 04:30.010
Cathy, I can't complain.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.888
I'd like to announce
that that was great.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.457
Really? I felt better
about it in rehearsal.

04:46.459 --> 04:47.993
They liked it,
and you, they loved.

04:47.995 --> 04:49.960
You don't mind that I ad-libbed, right?
I loved your writing.

04:49.962 --> 04:53.498
- It felt very natural.
- Yeah. I've realized I guess, in the moment,

04:53.500 --> 04:56.767
that I didn't really
know her, you know?

04:56.769 --> 04:58.469
That's not purely
a script criticism,

04:58.471 --> 05:00.671
my performance
was a bit inhibited.

05:00.673 --> 05:03.608
I think there's a lot of great
stuff to take from this.

05:03.610 --> 05:05.443
- Agreed.
- Absolutely.

05:05.445 --> 05:07.614
Professionals.

05:55.094 --> 05:57.262
<i>Hi, you've
reached the office of Peter Fielding.</i>

05:57.264 --> 05:59.063
<i>I'm afraid I can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

05:59.065 --> 06:01.866
<i>so please leave a message after the
tone and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

06:01.868 --> 06:03.702
<i>Bye for now.</i>

06:03.704 --> 06:06.837
<i>Peter, hi.
It's Audrey Green calling.</i>

06:06.839 --> 06:08.772
<i>I don't know if you got
my last message,</i>

06:08.774 --> 06:11.642
<i>but I have an audition today,</i>

06:11.644 --> 06:13.277
<i>so wish me luck.</i>

06:13.279 --> 06:16.583
<i>I haven't read the whole thing,
but it seems pretty interesting.</i>

06:17.250 --> 06:18.717
Based on the sides, anyway.

06:18.719 --> 06:21.620
- <i>Also, I got a new head shot.</i>
- Big smile, Audrey.

06:21.622 --> 06:25.022
<i>I'll e-mail it to you so you have it on file.</i>

06:25.024 --> 06:29.527
<i>Lastly, I just wanted to see if you
had put me up for anything recently,</i>

06:29.529 --> 06:33.565
<i>um, commercials
or, or anything, really.</i>

06:33.567 --> 06:36.101
<i>Anyway, I'd love to chat with
you when you have a moment.</i>

06:36.103 --> 06:39.537
Um, so I'll speak
with you soon, I hope.

06:39.539 --> 06:42.976
Um, take care, bye-bye.

06:48.781 --> 06:51.151
<i>You were always good
to me, Ms. Sommersby.</i>

07:18.144 --> 07:19.613
Audrey Green.

07:48.207 --> 07:52.376
- How did it go?
- Uh, I think I came off pretty nervous, because I was.

07:52.378 --> 07:54.712
I'm sure that was more apparent
to you than it was to them.

07:54.714 --> 07:57.349
I think they really like me, but I
don't feel as confident as I'd like to.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.284
- I certainly hope so.
- They didn't ask about my ability...

07:59.286 --> 08:01.986
- How's your writing going?
- I've got a new draft,

08:01.988 --> 08:04.356
and I think it addresses
a lot of your concerns.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.623
Great. Can't wait to read it.

08:05.625 --> 08:07.959
No, it was actually that bad.

08:07.961 --> 08:10.163
I don't know how
I'm going to break it to Barry.

10:47.387 --> 10:48.952
I can't sleep.

10:48.954 --> 10:52.158
Do you wanna watch me
do my taxes? It might help.

10:53.459 --> 10:55.228
You wanna narrate for me?

10:55.929 --> 10:59.100
- Sure.
- Okay.

10:59.999 --> 11:03.002
- No detail too small.
- Okay.

11:07.073 --> 11:11.809
This one is for
a lunch at Phil's.

11:11.811 --> 11:14.846
It was for $12.77.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.816
We can file that
under entertainment.

11:17.818 --> 11:19.853
This is perfect.

11:25.825 --> 11:28.927
And this one
is for printer ink.

11:28.929 --> 11:32.130
- It was $37.99.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:32.132 --> 11:36.170
- That can be filed under office supplies.
- Mmm.

11:44.945 --> 11:48.913
And this one here is for
that Kingston production

11:48.915 --> 11:52.183
of <i>Memory Card</i> at The Jupiter.

11:52.185 --> 11:55.955
- We can file that under research.
- Hmm.

12:06.932 --> 12:08.802
So much paper.

12:10.336 --> 12:14.340
- This one's for that wig from April.
- Hmm.

12:21.580 --> 12:25.385
New stapler. $6.99.

12:26.453 --> 12:28.589
Guess office supplies, again.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.236
So many lunches.

12:48.941 --> 12:50.376
So many.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.353
It's become a significant
source of income for us

13:36.355 --> 13:41.425
and now I'm wondering, you know,
because we have all these expenses,

13:41.427 --> 13:45.996
rent, lunches with potential
clients, business cards...

13:45.998 --> 13:48.368
Have you seen the business
cards, by the way?

13:51.570 --> 13:53.471
It's very nice.

13:53.473 --> 13:56.043
Anyway, I'm wondering if now isn't
the time for us to incorporate.

13:57.444 --> 13:59.577
Okay, wonderful.

13:59.579 --> 14:03.918
Can I assume that your company
will clear over $60,000 this year?

14:07.454 --> 14:11.558
How much do you anticipate
you'll make this year?

14:17.063 --> 14:18.399
Let me buy you lunch.

14:21.133 --> 14:23.333
You okay for money?

14:23.335 --> 14:26.737
You know, a few thousand wouldn't
make much difference to me.

14:26.739 --> 14:29.409
- Dad, please.
- Hmm.

14:38.584 --> 14:40.584
<i>Hi,
you've reached Audrey Green.</i>

14:40.586 --> 14:42.720
<i>I'm sorry I can't take
your call right now,</i>

14:42.722 --> 14:44.654
<i>but if you leave a message I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

14:44.656 --> 14:47.524
<i>Thanks for calling and have a great day.</i>

14:47.526 --> 14:50.461
<i>Hello, this is a message for Audrey Green.</i>

14:50.463 --> 14:53.463
<i>Hi, Audrey, thank you for
auditioning for A Different Trench.</i>

14:53.465 --> 14:54.499
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

14:54.501 --> 14:58.669
Can I give you some advice
as your accountant?

15:01.608 --> 15:03.344
I have to take this.

15:05.045 --> 15:07.580
- Hello?
- <i>I didn't get it.</i>

15:09.248 --> 15:12.750
- Meet me at the place?
- <i>Twenty minutes.</i>

15:12.752 --> 15:15.486
There were, like, 500 other people
there who are going to get it.

15:15.488 --> 15:18.124
They're gonna give the part to
500 other people and not me.

15:18.757 --> 15:20.191
The producer was nice.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.459
Don't get waggy on me this early.
I thought you said it was fine.

15:22.461 --> 15:24.495
Well my "fine"
is terrible, probably.

15:24.497 --> 15:28.598
- Shut up, please.
- Will do, Chief.

15:38.143 --> 15:41.212
- Can it have blood?
- Have you asked about that before?

15:41.214 --> 15:42.579
No, actually.

15:42.581 --> 15:47.184
What if we just saw the bereaved
family and felt the absence?

15:47.186 --> 15:50.121
Like an empty chair
at the breakfast table.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.155
- I have my reservations.
- Okay.

15:52.157 --> 15:53.591
The more I think about it,

15:53.593 --> 15:56.294
the more I think we need to divorce
the images from feeling and emotion

15:56.296 --> 15:58.829
and just show, like,
blood and destruction

15:58.831 --> 16:03.300
and not give people the chance to
feel sadness or that sense of loss.

16:03.302 --> 16:06.203
Instead, they're just met
with violence.

16:06.205 --> 16:07.804
We need to explain
the accident.

16:07.806 --> 16:10.109
Do we? Do we?

16:12.177 --> 16:13.279
Okay.

16:20.219 --> 16:22.186
Can you help me with this?

16:22.188 --> 16:24.355
Just a minute,
I gotta finish this.

16:24.357 --> 16:27.757
- This is important.
- This is important.

16:27.759 --> 16:30.193
This is important, too. God.

16:30.195 --> 16:32.130
Please?

16:32.132 --> 16:33.566
Okay.

16:34.733 --> 16:36.603
The nerve of some people.

16:44.643 --> 16:47.345
- I'm doing it now.
- Good for you.

16:47.347 --> 16:49.480
- What would you do with it?
- Pour it over something.

16:49.482 --> 16:52.783
- Maybe you've got a broken...
- Tibia? Fibia?

16:52.785 --> 16:56.323
- What do you break in a workplace, exactly?
- Stapler, probably.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.188
Hearts.

16:58.190 --> 17:00.757
We could just show
a really graphic expression

17:00.759 --> 17:04.561
but maybe also, kind of, abstracted
expression of workplace trauma,

17:04.564 --> 17:07.230
so that they just have to
experience it.

17:07.232 --> 17:11.169
And then after a barrage
of that, we go to a title.

17:11.171 --> 17:13.271
Bam. "Workplace Safety."

17:13.272 --> 17:16.174
- So, we're not in it? It's more of a multimedia...
- Google thresher injury.

17:16.175 --> 17:19.377
You'll thank me.
You'll be able to see.

17:19.378 --> 17:22.179
- It'll be wonderful.
- I'm sure it will.

17:25.285 --> 17:27.784
Susan?
Oh, God, Susan!

17:27.786 --> 17:30.353
Legally, they're obligated
to do this every year.

17:30.355 --> 17:32.957
What we've gotta do is give
them something interesting.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.457
- Why?
- Because we can.

17:34.459 --> 17:37.428
We can and we must
fulfill that sacred trust.

17:37.430 --> 17:40.531
- Wait, can it rhyme? Right.
- Mmm, better not.

17:40.533 --> 17:41.735
Professionals.

17:45.604 --> 17:51.274
Fuck. Fuck! No good. No good.
Ugh! What're you doing?

17:51.276 --> 17:53.544
So, we see the aftermath first?

17:53.546 --> 17:57.314
Yes, then, maybe, interviews
with the family or something

17:57.316 --> 18:00.251
about the lifetime of suffering
they'll have to deal with.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.986
Then the accident, then the
fatal mistake that led to it.

18:02.988 --> 18:06.323
- Fatal?
- Why not? It's bigger. It gives us more to play.

18:06.325 --> 18:07.326
Are the walls there white?

18:36.389 --> 18:37.688
I like it.

18:37.690 --> 18:41.292
I think we'd be playing with
cliches in an interesting way.

18:58.277 --> 19:00.311
- Uh, this is for you.
- Oh!

19:00.313 --> 19:02.612
- Hello.
- Thanks.

19:02.614 --> 19:05.682
I thought your performance
today was really outstanding.

19:05.684 --> 19:08.953
- Oh, wow! Thanks so much.
- Yeah. Really incredible.

19:08.955 --> 19:10.854
We don't get that here.

19:10.856 --> 19:13.591
- Outstanding.
- Hey, it's my pleasure.

19:13.593 --> 19:16.360
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

19:16.362 --> 19:18.461
Uh, are you guys back here
at any point?

19:18.463 --> 19:21.399
Uh, well, our schedule's
changing all the time, really.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.934
But, you know,
I'll give you my card.

19:23.936 --> 19:26.036
Sure.

19:26.038 --> 19:28.608
- Here you go. Take care.
- Great.

19:41.653 --> 19:44.688
- June, oh, my God, that was amazing.
- Hey!

19:44.690 --> 19:47.425
- Thanks so much! We really did it!
- I can't believe it.

19:47.427 --> 19:51.461
I mean, I totally believe it. I've just, I
have never seen anything like this before.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.363
This kind of scale
is just beyond.

19:53.365 --> 19:57.501
- How many people was that?
- Thirteen, not counting the doubled parts.

19:57.503 --> 19:58.869
Did I tell you
it came from a dream?

19:58.871 --> 20:01.572
- No.
- Really? No, that wasn't in the notes.

20:01.574 --> 20:03.841
- Why wasn't that in the program?
- How long did you rehearse?

20:03.843 --> 20:05.508
About 17 weeks.

20:05.510 --> 20:07.378
- Wow.
- We had a grant.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.880
- Do you ever apply?
- I have all these commissions.

20:10.882 --> 20:13.050
The Kingston Foundation.

20:13.052 --> 20:14.251
- Mmm, of course.
- Nick's great.

20:14.253 --> 20:16.586
He's gonna be at this fundraiser
thing tomorrow night.

20:16.588 --> 20:19.357
- You guys should come.
- It's probably pretty exclusive.

20:19.359 --> 20:21.792
Extremely. Completely.

20:21.794 --> 20:22.993
I have a pass.

20:22.995 --> 20:24.698
But it's just for me.

20:27.366 --> 20:29.699
But I'm resourceful.

20:29.701 --> 20:32.703
And those figures will be
confirmed early next week.

20:32.705 --> 20:35.573
- Is that somewhat accurate, Phillip?
- It is, indeed.

20:35.575 --> 20:38.441
Terrific. Okay, uh,
on another note,

20:38.443 --> 20:41.946
HR has asked
that we do an info-session

20:41.948 --> 20:47.384
on sexual harassment in the workplace
either this week or next week

20:47.386 --> 20:50.153
just to make sure
we've covered that ground

20:50.155 --> 20:52.422
in some kind
of meaningful way...

20:52.424 --> 20:53.959
Do we need a demonstration?

20:58.398 --> 21:00.434
Because I know somebody.

21:07.539 --> 21:08.642
Looks like
a good time.

21:09.642 --> 21:12.612
- Lillian, is that you?
- It's me.

21:15.748 --> 21:16.982
See you inside.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.607
You crushed the bar code.

21:43.609 --> 21:44.911
Did I?

21:47.979 --> 21:50.150
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:52.084 --> 21:53.918
Very nice.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.954
- It looks great in here.
- I know.

21:56.956 --> 21:58.558
You look sublime.

21:59.659 --> 22:01.094
Hey, hold on a second.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.629
- Perfect.
- You, too.

22:23.783 --> 22:25.582
- I'm going to find the bar.
- Let's get a drink.

22:25.584 --> 22:27.584
The scene
is really quiet, right?

22:27.586 --> 22:30.653
We've just come down
from that crescendo, catharsis.

22:30.655 --> 22:33.023
- You know the part?
- Yeah.

22:33.025 --> 22:34.725
You could hear a pin drop.

22:34.727 --> 22:39.596
And this woman in the audience
just starts sobbing.

22:39.598 --> 22:43.934
- Wow.
- I don't know if it's a good thing, necessarily.

22:43.936 --> 22:47.505
She was really sobbing,
uncontrollably.

22:47.507 --> 22:51.478
Like, we paused
as it was applause,

22:53.078 --> 22:55.548
but she just wouldn't stop.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.885
And what I'm saying is

23:01.219 --> 23:05.288
I don't really get it.

23:05.290 --> 23:09.659
What's the point of all this?
What are we doing this for?

23:09.661 --> 23:12.630
Well, it's beautiful.
It's a connection.

23:12.632 --> 23:14.598
But what for?

23:14.600 --> 23:15.932
What are we saying
to each other?

23:15.934 --> 23:18.204
Is that for us to decide?
It's not.

23:19.104 --> 23:21.639
Should be, shouldn't it?

23:21.641 --> 23:24.207
You made a woman cry, Hannan.

23:24.209 --> 23:28.812
Reasons I'm doing this, and I actually
said this, one, because I love it.

23:28.814 --> 23:30.915
This might not be clear
to you people,

23:30.917 --> 23:33.883
but just because you wanna buy
doesn't mean I'm for sale.

23:33.885 --> 23:36.286
Actually?
You actually said it?

23:36.288 --> 23:37.522
This is a real thing?

23:37.524 --> 23:40.224
And then I met Alice the same day.
I'm not even kidding.

23:40.226 --> 23:41.324
I took it as a sign.

23:41.326 --> 23:43.796
She'd be here, but she's
doing a session at Bard.

23:45.597 --> 23:48.332
It's the acoustics
of architecture,

23:48.334 --> 23:51.936
but it's not practical.
It's strictly theoretical.

23:51.938 --> 23:56.105
- Which isn't to say that it isn't the real thing.
- No.

23:56.107 --> 23:59.176
It's just sometimes
people say that.

23:59.178 --> 24:02.746
What are you doing? Are you working?
I haven't seen you in forever.

24:02.748 --> 24:06.249
- God! Audrey!
- Yeah, I've been, kind of, laying low.

24:06.251 --> 24:10.286
But what are you doing, though? Audrey.

24:10.288 --> 24:11.487
What're you doing?

24:11.489 --> 24:14.592
It seems kind of silly to
say, but I guess it's not.

24:14.594 --> 24:18.329
I got that grant
after last year, which,

24:18.331 --> 24:21.031
you know... And
basically, the premise of the thing

24:21.033 --> 24:23.633
is it allows you to work on
something for months just writing,

24:23.635 --> 24:25.636
which, in itself, is amazing.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.103
It's in a lodge
on a mountain.

24:27.105 --> 24:31.342
And then rehearsal...
It sounds grandiose, I know,

24:31.344 --> 24:34.143
but I met
some amazing folks.

24:34.145 --> 24:38.114
So, I decided from this dream
I had, this mountain dream

24:38.116 --> 24:41.384
that I wanted to do
a large ensemble piece.

24:41.386 --> 24:43.387
I had
this recurring one

24:43.389 --> 24:47.323
about a city block or people
at night in a blackout.

24:47.325 --> 24:50.226
That's what nature does to you
I guess, urban withdrawal.

24:50.228 --> 24:52.963
And then the characters came
from various subsequent dreams.

24:52.965 --> 24:54.665
And from just sitting outside

24:54.667 --> 24:57.668
and waiting for interesting
people to walk by.

24:57.670 --> 25:00.236
I've a pad I keep by bed.
Do you do that?

25:00.238 --> 25:02.072
- Have a pad?
- No.

25:02.074 --> 25:03.774
You should try it.
It's really worked for me.

25:03.776 --> 25:05.676
It's super freeing
to let your subconscious

25:05.678 --> 25:06.810
do the work for you
in that way.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.678
I have all these deadlines.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.313
Oh, my God, June.

25:10.315 --> 25:13.650
- Next month, I'm opening my own space.
- Wow.

25:13.652 --> 25:16.120
It's small,
but it's mine, so...

25:16.122 --> 25:17.787
Yeah.

25:17.789 --> 25:19.823
Like, I am super stoked.

25:19.825 --> 25:23.060
- But you dream.
- Sure, of course.

25:23.062 --> 25:26.929
And then you wake up, all you
need is a pen which you've got.

25:26.931 --> 25:30.300
- Uh-huh.
- And then you write stuff down.

25:30.302 --> 25:32.703
I don't think my dreams
are particularly interesting.

25:32.705 --> 25:37.740
Well, that can't be true. Fears,
desires, unspoken sublimated emotions,

25:37.742 --> 25:39.376
there's all kinds
of material in there.

25:39.378 --> 25:43.746
So this is just going directly to
the source and asking yourself

25:43.748 --> 25:46.784
"What do I really want?

25:46.786 --> 25:48.217
What do I need to confront?"

25:48.219 --> 25:49.419
And then you can extrapolate
from there

25:49.421 --> 25:51.854
in terms of how you wanna
approach things in the work.

25:51.856 --> 25:53.857
So, is it
like a Jungian type...

25:53.859 --> 25:55.124
Oh, there's no philosophy
in it at all.

25:55.126 --> 25:57.127
It's literally
just write it down.

25:57.129 --> 26:00.363
"What do I
want to do unconsciously?"

26:00.365 --> 26:03.833
I don't have a lot of time
for exploratory stuff, lately.

26:03.835 --> 26:06.370
June! Can I get you
a drink? Kate's here.

26:06.372 --> 26:08.171
Could I have a Will Rogers?

26:08.173 --> 26:09.739
- Kate...
- Uh, a Will?

26:09.741 --> 26:10.874
Will Rogers.
It's orange. He'll know.

26:10.876 --> 26:13.776
- Do you know Kate? She's producing...
- No, sorry, I...

26:13.778 --> 26:15.746
Talk to Nick.
You really should.

26:15.748 --> 26:18.782
Unless you don't want to,
in which case...

26:18.784 --> 26:20.817
- I appreciate that a lot.
- Give me one moment,

26:20.819 --> 26:23.720
- I just have to go say hi to somebody.
- Sure.

26:23.722 --> 26:25.658
I'm so glad you made it in.

26:28.427 --> 26:30.761
<i>I'm in London
most of the time these days.</i>

26:30.763 --> 26:33.831
The London. I've been telling people
that I don't really know what I'm doing,

26:33.833 --> 26:35.899
but it's kind of a lie.

26:35.901 --> 26:37.900
I'm working at
such an amazing gallery.

26:37.902 --> 26:40.903
My website is awesome.
The people are amazing.

26:40.905 --> 26:42.906
Things are really looking up.

26:42.908 --> 26:44.774
- You should come visit.
- Totally.

26:44.776 --> 26:47.811
I'm serious. You should totally come visit.
It would be so great.

26:47.813 --> 26:50.046
Sure.

26:50.048 --> 26:52.352
Really miss it here sometimes.

26:53.352 --> 26:54.954
What are you up to?

27:03.929 --> 27:06.865
The sound of Toronto.

27:20.345 --> 27:21.948
Audrey! Excuse me.

27:30.922 --> 27:34.257
Hey, I'm sitting with Nick. I told him
about you. He really wants to meet you.

27:34.259 --> 27:36.927
- What?
- Nick Kingston. The reason you're here Nick.

27:36.929 --> 27:40.464
- Oh, I didn't know that...
- Come talk to him. Tell him what you're doing.

27:40.466 --> 27:43.199
- I'm not doing anything.
- Tell him what you're working on.

27:43.201 --> 27:46.069
- Nothing. I don't have anything.
- No.

27:46.071 --> 27:49.372
I'm not ready. I'm not prepared.
I've only had today.

27:49.374 --> 27:51.210
I'm not going!

27:55.146 --> 27:57.046
Okay.

27:57.048 --> 28:01.086
Sorry. If you want me,
I'll just be over here.

28:03.488 --> 28:05.124
Okay.

28:14.299 --> 28:18.869
I'm so happy that you're
out and you're here.

28:18.871 --> 28:22.005
You're doing so well. God!

28:22.007 --> 28:24.777
Look at you.
So good!

28:26.612 --> 28:30.948
- Right? You're okay?
- Yeah! Yeah.

28:30.950 --> 28:33.286
All right. I just wanted
to make sure.

28:34.286 --> 28:35.955
I know.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.056
Now I'm sure.

28:38.990 --> 28:40.160
I know.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.499
Excuse me. Excuse me, sorry.

28:51.003 --> 28:53.039
Sorry, can I...
Thank you.

28:58.443 --> 28:59.812
I'm ready to go.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.471
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Audrey.</i>

29:28.473 --> 29:31.240
<i>It's Bradley
from Keller-Sutton.</i>

29:31.242 --> 29:34.143
- <i>Maybe you don't remember...</i>
- No, I remember you.

29:34.145 --> 29:37.883
Bradley. "Outstanding."

29:40.018 --> 29:42.386
- What's up?
- <i>Well,</i>

29:42.388 --> 29:46.456
<i>uh, it's looking like there might
be some other, uh, opportunities</i>

29:46.458 --> 29:48.492
<i>for presentations
in the near future,</i>

29:48.494 --> 29:52.228
<i>and I was wondering if, perhaps,
you'd like to get together</i>

29:52.230 --> 29:54.400
<i>and discuss that further.</i>

29:55.968 --> 29:57.570
<i>Over dinner, maybe.</i>

29:58.938 --> 30:00.070
Can I just, uh,

30:00.072 --> 30:01.505
gush here for a minute?

30:01.507 --> 30:05.108
I've seen a fair bit of theater
in this city and

30:05.110 --> 30:08.445
you are as good as the best
people I've seen.

30:08.447 --> 30:10.580
- You're better, even.
- Thank you.

30:10.582 --> 30:11.547
I try to challenge myself.

30:11.549 --> 30:14.351
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

30:14.353 --> 30:16.419
Have you always known this is
something you wanted to do?

30:16.421 --> 30:18.455
Dine-out on an expense account?
Oh, yeah.

30:18.457 --> 30:20.357
- Acting.
- I'm a big fan of other people's money.

30:20.359 --> 30:22.959
And of reimbursement
on principle.

30:22.961 --> 30:24.629
It's all been leading
to this moment.

30:24.631 --> 30:28.431
You're gonna hate me for saying this,
but, uh, I don't have an expense account.

30:28.433 --> 30:30.967
I do own a suit.

30:30.969 --> 30:33.136
And I'd much rather do
what you do.

30:33.138 --> 30:34.603
You seem very together.

30:34.605 --> 30:38.976
I get my phone. Can you say that for
posterity? Like, for my family.

30:38.978 --> 30:40.744
- They need to be convinced?
- Yeah.

30:40.746 --> 30:43.447
And I've been doing the most
boring job I could find

30:43.449 --> 30:45.047
for the past three years.

30:45.049 --> 30:47.316
- I own real estate.
- Really?

30:47.318 --> 30:48.418
Jesus.

30:48.420 --> 30:51.988
We own a cat. In the
loosest sense of the term.

30:51.990 --> 30:53.055
From a shelter.

30:53.057 --> 30:54.190
Oh, that's the right thing
to do.

30:54.192 --> 30:55.425
- Color?
- Charcoal.

30:55.427 --> 30:58.128
Good. There's a very
limited range

30:58.130 --> 31:00.263
you can play in management
is my problem.

31:00.265 --> 31:02.532
There's, uh, reliability.

31:02.534 --> 31:06.069
And that's it, reliability.

31:06.071 --> 31:08.071
I'm good at playing reliable.

31:08.073 --> 31:10.107
- You make a living.
- I do.

31:10.109 --> 31:11.408
We do.

31:11.410 --> 31:12.542
It could be better.

31:12.544 --> 31:15.111
Let's not talk about money
it's gross.

31:15.113 --> 31:18.148
As an amusing aside, I grew
up in a bed and breakfast.

31:18.150 --> 31:20.617
That says something,
but I don't know what.

31:20.619 --> 31:23.519
Wanting people to like me and a
fondness for hospital corners.

31:23.521 --> 31:25.155
The tighter you're
in there the better.

31:25.157 --> 31:26.355
Yeah.

31:30.028 --> 31:31.130
You're okay.

31:31.729 --> 31:33.098
Thank you.

31:33.431 --> 31:34.666
You too.

31:36.035 --> 31:39.736
- Uh, can I refill you, there?
- Thanks.

31:39.738 --> 31:42.773
- So, for this thing...
- Yes.

31:42.775 --> 31:47.143
We need something that's really
going to get people's attention.

31:47.145 --> 31:49.079
You know, really shock people.

31:49.081 --> 31:52.282
To say this thing
is not acceptable.

31:52.284 --> 31:55.485
- You know, sexual harassment is not acceptable.
- Yes, of course.

31:55.487 --> 31:59.121
Do you have any ideas for
possible scenarios we can do?

31:59.123 --> 32:00.823
Um... Oh, okay.

32:00.825 --> 32:05.195
We could do something where
you know, a lecherous boss

32:05.197 --> 32:07.163
invites one of his
employees somewhere.

32:07.165 --> 32:11.668
Uh, under the guise of work. When
really he has ulterior motives.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.507
I mean, would something
like that resonate with you?

32:28.453 --> 32:29.588
Good night.

34:20.431 --> 34:24.600
That was great.
I think you were really unique.

34:24.601 --> 34:26.138
- Thanks.
- Like...

34:27.371 --> 34:29.839
This is your money
for the performance.

34:29.841 --> 34:33.545
You both did a wonderful job and it
was great working with both of you.

34:34.513 --> 34:36.149
Thanks.

34:44.288 --> 34:45.424
Hmm.

35:32.270 --> 35:34.207
Lillian Wallace speaking.

35:34.806 --> 35:36.542
Oh, hey, Gary.

35:39.410 --> 35:40.745
Yeah, I think we're free.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.583
What's this one about?

35:57.462 --> 35:59.232
One more time, Gary?

36:14.812 --> 36:18.480
You know how on one moment the course
of your entire life can hinge.

36:18.482 --> 36:19.449
Sure.

36:19.451 --> 36:22.484
Leadership in times
of crisis and change.

36:22.486 --> 36:24.587
It'll be the biggest thing
we've ever done.

36:24.589 --> 36:25.788
Say more.

36:25.790 --> 36:28.591
Five to seven minutes
of stage time.

36:28.593 --> 36:30.794
- The Walbrook Hotel.
- Yes.

36:30.796 --> 36:33.332
More money than
we've ever seen at once.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.366
Three hundred people.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.466
Three hundred people?

36:37.468 --> 36:38.335
- Bam!
- Whoo!

36:42.073 --> 36:43.041
- Mmm.
- Oh, my God.

36:45.343 --> 36:48.913
To be clear, this is just
a loan until the show.

36:50.348 --> 36:51.750
That's as long as I need it.

36:52.517 --> 36:55.721
Or until after.

36:56.888 --> 36:58.020
Until.

36:58.022 --> 36:59.589
It's not good news.

36:59.591 --> 37:02.625
Well, it's not entirely bad.

37:02.627 --> 37:04.029
It's true, we're quite unique.

37:05.564 --> 37:07.464
The future's in flux.

37:07.466 --> 37:10.366
February may still
be a possibility.

37:10.368 --> 37:11.967
We're canceling.

37:11.969 --> 37:13.670
C-A-N...

37:13.672 --> 37:17.473
Thank you. Despite that I'm
afraid we'll have to cancel.

37:17.475 --> 37:19.644
No, actually.
There was no deposit.

37:38.964 --> 37:40.533
Mmm-hmm.

37:43.100 --> 37:44.701
Ready?

37:44.703 --> 37:47.473
We are those people.
Find them.

38:08.426 --> 38:09.859
- Oh, wait. Hang on.
- What?

38:09.861 --> 38:11.761
- You've got something...
- What is it?

38:13.464 --> 38:15.031
- It's just a leaf or something.
- Thanks.

38:15.033 --> 38:18.567
You know, what I was saying
before wasn't just the weed.

38:18.569 --> 38:21.140
- I do actually wanna quit.
- Okay.

38:22.607 --> 38:25.708
But the problem is,
I'm going to be tempted.

38:25.710 --> 38:28.178
To buy new packs
of cigarettes, frequently.

38:28.180 --> 38:31.480
- Which means, I'm gonna buy new packs of cigarettes.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:31.482 --> 38:33.616
If and when I do.
What I want you to do is

38:33.618 --> 38:36.752
take them from me
by force if necessary.

38:36.754 --> 38:41.156
And emphatically toss them
into the distance somewhere.

38:41.158 --> 38:42.491
Can you do that?

38:42.493 --> 38:43.895
Emphatically?

38:44.196 --> 38:45.398
Yeah.

38:51.069 --> 38:52.605
Exactly.

38:53.939 --> 38:55.571
- Badges?
- Tickets.

38:55.573 --> 38:56.707
Well...

38:56.709 --> 38:58.607
- What, uh, what you need are badges.
- Tickets, yes.

38:58.609 --> 38:59.741
- Yes.
- Industry comps.

38:59.743 --> 39:01.611
Well, what we have are badges.

39:01.613 --> 39:03.480
- Conference badges.
- Okay, great.

39:03.482 --> 39:08.585
- Okay.
- I don't think I'm properly conveying this to you gals.

39:08.587 --> 39:11.520
The thing here is
that, uh...

39:11.522 --> 39:17.560
A lot of major corporations will... will
pay a substantial amount of money to, uh,

39:17.562 --> 39:19.862
buy these badges for
their employees.

39:19.864 --> 39:21.897
- We just need 20.
- Or a smaller number.

39:21.899 --> 39:27.536
Well, uh, uh, we plan a
lot of this in advance, you see.

39:27.538 --> 39:29.272
- There's...
- We completely understand, Gary.

39:29.274 --> 39:30.707
- Ten tickets.
- Badges.

39:30.709 --> 39:33.542
Just so we can say to the people in
our industry you know, this is...

39:33.544 --> 39:34.578
This is what we've been
working on.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.216
- My hands are really tied here.
- I need this.

39:38.616 --> 39:41.116
Well, that's the thing with
you actors, isn't it?

39:41.118 --> 39:45.154
You really do need a...
An audience to perform for.

39:45.156 --> 39:46.154
Exactly.

39:46.156 --> 39:48.993
I was just talking about this,
uh, to my niece.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.132
- Niece, Gary?
- Yeah. Yeah, uh, Fiona.

39:53.864 --> 39:55.598
In fact, uh...

39:55.600 --> 39:58.600
Maybe, there's a part for
her, uh, in your production?

39:58.602 --> 40:00.737
- Well...
- That's, uh,

40:00.739 --> 40:05.107
something to consider anyways while I'm
working on the, uh... On the badges.

40:05.109 --> 40:06.711
Badges.

40:11.649 --> 40:15.083
Wilt thou be led by me
and try the venture?

40:15.085 --> 40:17.256
Aye. Indeed.

40:17.855 --> 40:19.221
Lead on.

40:19.223 --> 40:20.656
Why should
we tarry?

40:20.658 --> 40:25.897
First we need a rich and trailing
robe of fine linen to gird thee.

40:26.230 --> 40:27.629
Nay,

40:27.631 --> 40:29.232
my, a woman,

40:29.234 --> 40:30.567
then...

40:30.569 --> 40:32.705
and no man more.

40:34.739 --> 40:37.042
Wouldst have them slay
thee dead?

40:38.176 --> 40:40.743
No man may see
their mysteries.

40:40.745 --> 40:44.047
What garb wilt thou bestow
about me?

40:44.049 --> 40:47.850
First, a long tress dangling
low beneath thy shoulders.

40:47.852 --> 40:48.917
Aye.

40:48.919 --> 40:50.185
And next?

40:50.187 --> 40:54.056
The said robe, falling to thy
feet and on thy head a snood.

40:54.058 --> 40:55.658
Enough!

40:55.660 --> 40:57.930
I cannot wear a robe
and a snood.

41:00.631 --> 41:02.100
Okay.

41:02.734 --> 41:04.236
So, who are we inviting?

41:05.703 --> 41:07.804
- <i>Raul LaSalle.</i>
- <i>Nope.</i>

41:07.806 --> 41:09.275
<i>Arts Council.</i>

41:11.375 --> 41:14.680
<i>Theresa Walsh-Gibbons,
Hoberman Grant.</i>

41:15.814 --> 41:18.047
<i>Nicholas Kingston, impresario.</i>

41:18.049 --> 41:20.783
It's art. Get your mind
out of the gutter.

41:20.785 --> 41:24.087
It would also be good to get a
handful of press out to this thing.

41:24.089 --> 41:25.224
Agreed.

41:26.757 --> 41:30.692
I'm thinking Kevin Carlino,
<i>Stage Whispers.</i>

41:30.694 --> 41:34.663
Thomas Kilgallen,
<i>Spotlight Drama.</i>

41:34.665 --> 41:36.866
<i>Julian Westlake,</i>
Theatricality.

41:36.868 --> 41:38.671
You don't look like this, Dad.

41:40.105 --> 41:41.103
Don't I?

41:41.105 --> 41:43.806
- What about your agent?
- He's not the best.

41:43.808 --> 41:45.808
If we can, I'd like to invite
some others.

41:45.810 --> 41:47.145
Such as?

41:48.379 --> 41:51.049
<i>Jason Clavir, GPA.</i>

41:54.752 --> 41:57.789
<i>Lisa Preston
of Preston, Kaplan, Walker.</i>

42:00.357 --> 42:03.759
- <i>Andrew Morrison.</i>
- Well, I've got good news and bad news.

42:03.761 --> 42:05.761
<i>Morrison Fell.</i>

42:05.763 --> 42:07.797
Just kidding,
it's only good news.

42:07.799 --> 42:09.399
<i>Who else?</i>

42:09.401 --> 42:12.171
- <i>June, of course.</i>
- And maybe, when you say that you could look up?

42:13.705 --> 42:16.138
Good, that's good.

42:16.140 --> 42:17.940
- How many is that?
- Doesn't matter. Keep going.

42:17.942 --> 42:20.009
<i>Hi, you've
reached the office of Peter Fielding.</i>

42:20.011 --> 42:22.178
<i>I'm afraid I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

42:22.180 --> 42:24.047
<i>So, please leave a message after
the tone and I'll get back to you.</i>

42:24.049 --> 42:25.681
<i>Bye for now.</i>

42:25.683 --> 42:27.817
<i>Peter, hi.
Audrey Green again.</i>

42:27.819 --> 42:31.219
<i>I just wanted to update you on
a booking on December the 19th.</i>

42:31.221 --> 42:34.424
<i>Lillian and I will be performing
at the Walbrook Hotel at 2:00 p.m.</i>

42:34.426 --> 42:36.725
<i>for an audience of 300.</i>

42:36.727 --> 42:38.326
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

42:38.328 --> 42:39.862
<i>Uh, anyway, you have my number.</i>

42:39.864 --> 42:42.368
<i>I hope you're okay.
Bye.</i>

42:44.435 --> 42:48.737
Leadership. What that says to me
is, "What's the power dynamic?"

42:48.739 --> 42:49.873
Who's in charge? You or me?

42:49.875 --> 42:51.741
- I think I should be in charge.
- I think I should.

42:51.743 --> 42:52.908
See, this is good. Conflict.

42:52.910 --> 42:54.377
Is that the thing?
Are we vying for some...

42:54.379 --> 42:55.478
There's a chain of command.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.846
And that's a source
of tension,

42:56.848 --> 42:59.781
All they really wanna see is
someone in a position of authority

42:59.783 --> 43:01.116
- help another person.
- Whom they outrank.

43:01.118 --> 43:04.353
Help this lower-ranking person
through some kind of personal...

43:04.355 --> 43:06.723
- Crisis?
- And change, yes.

43:06.725 --> 43:08.424
Is that the title, by the way?

43:08.426 --> 43:09.962
We can come back to that.

43:10.828 --> 43:12.862
Chains.

43:12.864 --> 43:14.029
Is that a serious suggestion?

43:14.031 --> 43:15.230
I don't know. Do you like it?

43:15.232 --> 43:17.100
I'm your boss.
Your concerned boss.

43:17.102 --> 43:18.900
- I have a drinking problem.
- I know you do.

43:18.902 --> 43:20.837
You know I do.
I drink too much.

43:20.839 --> 43:22.772
- Much too much.
- I'm an alcoholic.

43:22.774 --> 43:23.772
Yes.

43:23.774 --> 43:26.141
We still have to come up
with a part for the kid.

43:26.143 --> 43:27.377
Oh.

43:27.379 --> 43:29.745
We have always talked about
having additional characters.

43:30.948 --> 43:32.013
Right.

43:32.015 --> 43:34.218
- She has to have a role.
- And lines.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.721
Or a line.

43:38.756 --> 43:40.790
You attack me.
It's all very personal.

43:40.792 --> 43:41.757
But I stay in control.

43:41.759 --> 43:43.859
The kid comes in,
says something. One thing.

43:43.861 --> 43:45.393
One quick thing
and then it ends.

43:45.395 --> 43:47.295
But there's hope.

43:47.297 --> 43:49.868
I don't know. Are we
challenging ourselves enough?

43:50.535 --> 43:51.933
Yes.

43:51.935 --> 43:53.236
It can't just be another
active listening...

43:53.238 --> 43:55.904
- What's wrong with active listening?
- It needs to be special.

43:55.906 --> 43:57.843
Everything we do is special.

44:00.145 --> 44:01.313
It will be.

44:02.312 --> 44:03.915
It has to be.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.786
- So, these two girls.
- Women.

44:09.788 --> 44:11.920
Women. They come up to you and
ask you to be in this thing?

44:11.922 --> 44:13.855
They know my uncle.
They asked if he knew anyone.

44:13.857 --> 44:16.025
People know my uncle too.
They don't ask me to act.

44:16.027 --> 44:17.560
I have a certain thing,
I guess.

44:17.562 --> 44:19.161
- I won't deny it.
- I mean, whatever.

44:19.163 --> 44:20.929
If this is my destiny,
I'm not gonna fight it.

44:20.931 --> 44:22.431
Wait, is that your destiny?

44:22.433 --> 44:23.833
Babes demand your presence?

44:23.835 --> 44:25.268
I guess so.

44:25.270 --> 44:25.969
Are they babes?

44:25.971 --> 44:27.969
Don't let's be vulgar, buddy.

44:27.971 --> 44:29.475
Fiona, are they babes, though?

44:30.274 --> 44:31.873
They totally are, right?

44:31.875 --> 44:33.875
You might say so, Marion.

44:33.877 --> 44:35.844
But I judge you for it.

44:35.846 --> 44:36.846
Can I break something?

44:36.848 --> 44:39.147
- What did you have in mind?
- A thing of water.

44:39.149 --> 44:41.283
- Carafe?
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe a few glasses.

44:41.285 --> 44:43.819
- Sure, assuming Gary's on board.
- Fuck Gary.

44:43.821 --> 44:45.187
Gary's been good to us.

44:45.189 --> 44:47.255
For the purposes of this,
fuck Gary. For now.

44:47.257 --> 44:50.292
All I'm saying is that if we're
gonna have shattered glass on stage

44:50.294 --> 44:52.094
- where there are other pres...
- It's not just a glass.

44:52.096 --> 44:54.563
It's that they want to see this
and the pamphlets say that.

44:54.565 --> 44:55.864
It's part of the process.

44:55.866 --> 44:56.799
This is not the process.

44:56.801 --> 44:58.900
I love the process.
The process is art.

44:58.902 --> 45:00.402
This is just...

45:00.404 --> 45:02.938
We've been hired to do a thing, okay.
This is that thing.

45:02.940 --> 45:04.207
This is that thing.

45:04.209 --> 45:06.174
Do I want it to be good?
Of course.

45:06.176 --> 45:08.877
- But we've gotta meet certain criteria or...
- Or what?

45:08.879 --> 45:10.647
Or we are not going to get
hired again,

45:10.649 --> 45:13.616
See, when you say things like that it makes
me think that this is just a job for you.

45:13.618 --> 45:15.118
It isn't just a job.
But it is a job.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.553
If we start cutting ourselves off from
things this early in the process...

45:17.555 --> 45:18.855
Stop saying process.

45:18.857 --> 45:20.890
We're just having a conversation here.
What is your problem?

45:20.892 --> 45:22.324
I'm not the one raising
my voice.

45:22.326 --> 45:23.558
Process!

45:27.397 --> 45:28.800
I'm sorry.

45:29.132 --> 45:30.569
No, I am.

45:31.535 --> 45:33.104
This is part of it.

45:34.372 --> 45:36.138
I have a question
about memorization.

45:36.140 --> 45:38.341
That won't be a problem.
You won't have many lines.

45:38.343 --> 45:40.042
I'm just here
for the experience.

45:40.044 --> 45:41.176
- That's a great attitude.
- Thanks.

45:41.178 --> 45:42.911
This isn't our choice,
your being here.

45:42.913 --> 45:44.413
- Lil...
- She has to know this.

45:44.415 --> 45:47.583
- But I thought you guys...
- Oh, is that what he told you?

45:47.585 --> 45:50.920
- I could leave.
- No, you can't. That's exactly the point.

45:50.922 --> 45:52.955
- It's a condition.
- It's blackmail, essentially.

45:52.957 --> 45:55.194
We're happy to have you, but
you can't expect much input.

45:58.962 --> 46:00.364
Okay, here goes.

46:01.531 --> 46:03.165
Amelia Watkins.

46:03.167 --> 46:06.636
She's the personnel manager
of our concern.

46:06.638 --> 46:11.973
<i>She and her husband continue to talk
about starting a consulting business.</i>

46:11.975 --> 46:14.912
<i>But she's not sure she wants
to risk that relationship.</i>

46:16.915 --> 46:19.518
<i>They met at a debate
tournament in their teens.</i>

46:21.551 --> 46:22.887
<i>She won.</i>

46:27.091 --> 46:29.194
<i>The last of her two kids
moved out in August.</i>

46:32.196 --> 46:34.029
<i>Her mother had arthritis.</i>

46:34.031 --> 46:37.065
<i>Her father, an un-diagnosed
heart condition.</i>

46:37.067 --> 46:39.634
<i>Thinking about this
makes her terrified.</i>

46:39.636 --> 46:41.472
<i>She walks everywhere she can.</i>

46:46.977 --> 46:48.479
<i>She was raised Catholic.</i>

46:51.149 --> 46:53.185
- Good morning.
- Morning.

46:54.618 --> 46:56.018
Morning.

46:56.020 --> 46:58.120
<i>Always has a
kind word for everyone.</i>

46:58.122 --> 47:00.089
- Good morning, Ms. Watkins.
- Good morning, Amelia.

47:00.091 --> 47:01.159
Penny!

47:01.960 --> 47:02.991
You look nice today.

47:02.993 --> 47:04.294
Thanks, so much.

47:04.296 --> 47:06.931
<i>She's worked there
long enough to mean it.</i>

47:09.500 --> 47:10.268
Good morning.

47:13.303 --> 47:15.705
Charlotte Angelica Gillis.
Age 33.

47:15.707 --> 47:19.210
Been at the box company for eight years.
An executive for four.

47:21.546 --> 47:23.279
<i>She feels a debt of gratitude
to her grandmother.</i>

47:23.281 --> 47:25.114
<i>Who left her
a nice inheritance,</i>

47:25.116 --> 47:26.716
<i>a passion for business,</i>

47:26.718 --> 47:29.018
<i>and a middle name.</i>

47:29.020 --> 47:31.453
<i>Unfortunately, none of these
were quite enough.</i>

47:40.998 --> 47:42.431
<i>She likes birding.</i>

47:42.433 --> 47:43.669
I see you.

47:48.339 --> 47:49.205
Fuck!

47:49.207 --> 47:51.176
<i>Started drinking at 14.</i>

47:53.277 --> 47:55.247
<i>She used to have
a boyfriend, Sam.</i>

47:56.180 --> 47:57.582
<i>When he left, he took the car.</i>

48:00.585 --> 48:02.685
So, with this new material,

48:02.687 --> 48:05.154
we'll be able to save 15%

48:05.156 --> 48:06.855
over the next quarter.

48:06.857 --> 48:12.194
We'll also be able to expand our boxing
enterprise into a number of different items.

48:12.196 --> 48:14.163
Uh, such as, wine boxes.

48:14.165 --> 48:15.431
Cereal boxes.

48:15.433 --> 48:16.635
Uh...

48:18.502 --> 48:20.736
Little late, Charlotte.

48:20.738 --> 48:23.642
<i>She's had one instance of
erratic behavior reported this quarter.</i>

48:27.210 --> 48:31.047
I can't restrain this chair
for long, Penny.

48:31.049 --> 48:32.985
<i>Twelve unreported.</i>

48:36.187 --> 48:37.819
Penelope Chillington,

48:37.821 --> 48:39.254
- Deputy Office Manager.
- Great.

48:39.256 --> 48:40.992
- Fabulous.
- Good job.

48:51.201 --> 48:53.069
- Are you Lillian?
- Yes, I am.

48:53.071 --> 48:54.370
Oh, Max, hi.

48:54.372 --> 48:56.174
I'll give you guys the tour.

48:59.176 --> 49:02.078
This is the
Barry Burnberg Theater.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.448
Now, it seats between 300
and 400 people.

49:05.450 --> 49:07.348
Depending upon whether you have

49:07.350 --> 49:10.719
tables or whatnot.
Which will not be the case

49:10.721 --> 49:13.121
in your particular event.

49:13.123 --> 49:14.457
Now, I understand that

49:14.459 --> 49:17.292
- you folks have reserved some seats.
- Yes.

49:17.294 --> 49:18.861
Ah, well,

49:18.863 --> 49:22.130
those are all right down here
in front.

49:22.132 --> 49:23.265
So, um...

49:23.267 --> 49:25.266
Lucky them.

49:25.268 --> 49:27.335
Now, I'm sure I don't
have to say this, but

49:27.337 --> 49:30.739
this is the stage where
you'll all be performing.

49:30.741 --> 49:33.174
Now, if you'll just follow me.

49:33.176 --> 49:35.446
And come back here. Thank you.

49:38.683 --> 49:40.152
Right this way, please.

49:40.884 --> 49:42.254
Hi, guys.

49:46.756 --> 49:50.561
So, as you can see, we have a
little backstage waiting room.

49:51.328 --> 49:52.795
Almost like a greenroom.

49:52.797 --> 49:54.629
Almost, yes.

49:54.631 --> 49:56.765
Now, um, we have,

49:56.767 --> 49:58.433
just as you can see,

49:58.435 --> 49:59.768
some chairs,

49:59.770 --> 50:01.636
and...

50:01.638 --> 50:05.306
Some magazines which I can't attest
to the quality of relevance of.

50:05.308 --> 50:07.275
And we do have a mini fridge.

50:07.277 --> 50:10.145
Now, that doesn't have any booze
or anything in it, but...

50:10.147 --> 50:12.281
It does have
some sparkling water.

50:12.283 --> 50:14.150
And some fresh fruit.

50:14.152 --> 50:17.422
Um, so, uh, anyone have
any questions, so far?

50:18.221 --> 50:20.355
Oh, go ahead, sir. Yes?

50:20.357 --> 50:22.393
Will we have access to
power outlets?

50:23.426 --> 50:25.529
I think we can
work something out.

50:26.797 --> 50:29.431
Overall, MGO likes the concept.

50:29.433 --> 50:31.500
We just have two
major concerns.

50:31.502 --> 50:32.868
Don't we have script approval?

50:32.870 --> 50:35.172
No, we do. MGO does.

50:36.239 --> 50:37.341
Please, continue.

50:38.408 --> 50:39.708
Uh...

50:39.710 --> 50:43.279
Firstly, uh, we feel that
the ending is too bleak.

50:43.281 --> 50:45.748
Uh, that it's not actually
demonstrating

50:45.750 --> 50:48.616
the proper approach
to the situation which is,

50:48.618 --> 50:49.854
after all its purpose.

50:50.453 --> 50:52.788
Alcoholism is bleak, Gary.

50:52.790 --> 50:54.390
Well, we understand that.

50:54.392 --> 50:58.627
Uh, but it is ultimately
supposed to be instructional.

50:58.629 --> 51:00.596
Uh, is it not?

51:00.598 --> 51:01.897
Um, besides can't,

51:01.899 --> 51:04.736
art be,
excuse me,

51:05.203 --> 51:06.701
idealistic?

51:06.703 --> 51:07.906
What's the other thing?

51:08.806 --> 51:10.272
Uh, secondly,

51:10.274 --> 51:12.607
you are not to under
any circumstances,

51:12.609 --> 51:15.344
uh, have broken glass
on the stage.

51:15.346 --> 51:16.978
That's not so much
a creative concern,

51:16.980 --> 51:20.516
as it is a safety
and insurance one.

51:20.518 --> 51:23.288
Can you agree
to both these things?

51:24.221 --> 51:25.790
We have to, don't we?

51:27.257 --> 51:28.426
I'm afraid so.

51:34.397 --> 51:36.364
I can't believe this shit.

51:36.366 --> 51:38.803
- You surprised?
- You know what? Fuck Gary.

51:41.772 --> 51:43.308
How does Sam feel?

51:44.808 --> 51:47.375
Sam's gone.

51:47.377 --> 51:48.546
Do you want me to look
over anything?

51:48.980 --> 51:50.282
Soon.

51:51.314 --> 51:52.450
Okay.

51:53.417 --> 51:56.284
Hey, uh, I have an idea
for a walk.

51:56.286 --> 51:57.685
Charlotte's walk.

51:57.687 --> 51:58.853
Do you wanna see?

51:58.855 --> 51:59.823
Of course.

52:20.377 --> 52:21.310
What do you think?

52:21.312 --> 52:22.611
I like it.

52:22.613 --> 52:23.948
Okay.

52:29.453 --> 52:30.989
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

53:22.372 --> 53:24.908
I understand.

53:25.710 --> 53:27.676
He understands
or you understand?

53:33.484 --> 53:35.520
Um...

53:36.053 --> 53:37.455
Excuse me.

53:41.024 --> 53:42.458
- Hello?
- Hi.

53:42.460 --> 53:44.493
Hey, um, it's...
It's Audrey.

53:44.495 --> 53:45.596
I know.

53:46.364 --> 53:47.929
Hi, uh, how are you?

53:47.931 --> 53:49.033
Busy tonight?

53:51.569 --> 53:53.371
Sorry, what is this regarding?

53:54.772 --> 53:56.138
What?

53:56.140 --> 53:59.507
Uh, we really enjoyed, uh, your...
What you brought to the event,

53:59.509 --> 54:01.409
uh, the other day.

54:01.411 --> 54:02.643
Uh, last week.

54:02.645 --> 54:04.712
<i>Oh, well, um, that's great.</i>

54:04.714 --> 54:06.748
I will certainly keep you
in the loop

54:06.750 --> 54:10.455
if anything like that, uh,
comes up again. Okay?

54:10.888 --> 54:12.420
Okay.

54:12.422 --> 54:13.924
- Thanks.
- Great.

54:14.591 --> 54:16.460
Well, have a nice day, okay?

54:16.993 --> 54:18.462
Thanks for calling.

54:19.096 --> 54:20.565
<i>Okay, you too.</i>

54:22.433 --> 54:23.501
Bye.

54:36.913 --> 54:39.049
Sorry about that.

55:00.538 --> 55:01.873
Just tell me the truth.

55:03.440 --> 55:04.940
You know.

55:04.942 --> 55:07.779
- We weren't gonna work out.
- That just isn't true though.

55:08.812 --> 55:09.780
No, it is.

55:11.515 --> 55:13.047
Okay, what do you mean?

55:13.049 --> 55:16.551
You never really cared
for me, not really.

55:16.553 --> 55:18.922
You knew I did for you and
you just let me be with you.

55:20.924 --> 55:22.558
Out of what?

55:22.560 --> 55:23.692
Kindness?

55:23.694 --> 55:25.697
Okay, that is not fair.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.035
I think, I knew
all along, actually.

55:33.203 --> 55:35.536
But I let it happen.

55:35.538 --> 55:37.806
Because I wanted to be
with you.

55:37.808 --> 55:40.712
I wanted to believe
what you were saying.

55:43.247 --> 55:45.850
Guess it's just a matter
of time before reality...

55:46.716 --> 55:48.552
<i>These are
their feelings.</i>

55:49.520 --> 55:50.889
<i>This is real.</i>

55:51.721 --> 55:55.524
Drinking problem.
Drinking problem.

55:55.526 --> 55:58.560
Drinking problem.
Problem drinking.

55:58.562 --> 56:00.495
Problem drinking.

56:00.497 --> 56:04.132
Drinking problem.
I have a drinking problem.

56:04.134 --> 56:05.737
I have a problem drinking.

56:06.270 --> 56:08.002
Drinking problem.

56:08.004 --> 56:09.440
Drinking problem.

56:10.006 --> 56:11.675
Problem drinking.

58:16.966 --> 58:18.667
So?

58:18.669 --> 58:21.136
Uh, yeah, it's, um...

58:21.138 --> 58:22.940
It's... It's good.

58:25.142 --> 58:26.741
Yeah?

58:26.743 --> 58:28.777
We should, uh...

58:28.779 --> 58:31.683
We should lose, uh,
the she will be, I think.

58:32.783 --> 58:34.982
Okay, sure.

58:34.984 --> 58:38.221
She asks if you're okay,
then black out.

58:39.756 --> 58:40.825
Trust the audience.

58:41.725 --> 58:42.627
But...

58:43.359 --> 58:44.227
Overall?

58:44.861 --> 58:45.896
Uh, yeah.

58:46.997 --> 58:48.065
Yeah.

59:16.359 --> 59:18.826
<i>Hi, you've
reached the office of Peter Fielding.</i>

59:18.828 --> 59:20.194
<i>I'm afraid I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

59:20.196 --> 59:22.029
<i>So please leave a message
after the tone</i>

59:22.031 --> 59:24.701
<i>and I'll get back to you soon.
Bye for now.</i>

59:26.703 --> 59:27.705
Peter?

59:29.006 --> 59:30.871
Do you ever wonder why I...

59:30.873 --> 59:33.276
Why we do this to ourselves?

59:34.877 --> 59:38.248
I... I mean, what... You must
know what I'm talking about.

59:39.248 --> 59:41.218
You know lots of...

59:43.053 --> 59:44.788
Or you don't.

59:45.723 --> 59:47.223
<i>Or you don't.</i>

59:47.225 --> 59:50.225
We're gonna have to flip it all the
way so it goes like, up, like an out,

59:50.227 --> 59:53.096
like a "V" shape, right? And then
it would have to go in sideways.

59:54.732 --> 59:55.964
Okay.

59:55.966 --> 59:58.033
<i>Not only do I not...</i>

59:58.035 --> 59:59.801
And then...

59:59.803 --> 01:00:02.370
<i>I don't even know
what I'm looking for.</i>

01:00:02.372 --> 01:00:03.440
- Yeah... Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:07.343 --> 01:00:08.311
<i>To feel...</i>

01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:14.482
Now, do
you wanna start?

01:00:14.484 --> 01:00:15.352
<i>This is fucked.</i>

01:00:16.252 --> 01:00:17.821
<i>Whatever.</i>

01:00:18.788 --> 01:00:19.457
Right?

01:00:21.257 --> 01:00:22.359
Whatever.

01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:27.164
Peter...

01:00:33.102 --> 01:00:35.472
I guess the subway's
closed by now, isn't it?

01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:41.009
You guys maybe think
I could crash here tonight?

01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:42.814
I think the subway's closed.

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.576
So when you say...

01:01:48.578 --> 01:01:49.511
I spent the night?

01:01:49.513 --> 01:01:51.011
I hate my life.

01:01:51.013 --> 01:01:52.948
It's ridiculously complex.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.350
It's like this matrix
of emotions.

01:01:55.352 --> 01:01:58.018
The three of us were,
like, interdependent.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.990
How do I
get these problems?

01:02:00.857 --> 01:02:02.022
Do you have a preference?

01:02:02.024 --> 01:02:04.225
Lillian. She just...

01:02:04.227 --> 01:02:06.229
Looks right through you,
you know?

01:02:06.529 --> 01:02:07.596
No.

01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:10.902
Um, these two and a pack
of Camel Yellows, please.

01:02:11.335 --> 01:02:12.503
You got some ID?

01:02:21.377 --> 01:02:22.643
Come in, Charlotte.

01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:25.080
Ms. Watkins. Hi.
Good morning.

01:02:25.082 --> 01:02:27.118
They said you wanted
to see me. Penny said.

01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:28.518
Water, Charlotte?

01:02:29.051 --> 01:02:29.984
Should I?

01:02:29.986 --> 01:02:31.254
- May I?
- Please.

01:02:31.989 --> 01:02:33.455
Water, Charlotte?

01:02:33.457 --> 01:02:35.089
"Pours herself some water."

01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:36.126
Sit down.

01:02:38.462 --> 01:02:41.362
Well, Penny said right.

01:02:41.364 --> 01:02:43.931
- Water?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.500
What is this
in reference to, exactly?

01:02:45.502 --> 01:02:46.801
Is it the toner?

01:02:46.803 --> 01:02:49.304
- Because all of my printing is...
- How are thing, Charlotte?

01:02:49.306 --> 01:02:50.672
...work-related.

01:02:50.674 --> 01:02:51.542
- What?
- Things at home.

01:02:52.276 --> 01:02:53.444
Things domestic.

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:55.179
Things personal.

01:02:56.046 --> 01:02:56.978
Things good?

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:57.913
Home life?

01:02:57.915 --> 01:02:58.946
Home life.

01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:00.582
Life at home.

01:03:00.584 --> 01:03:02.984
I'm quite well, thank you.

01:03:02.986 --> 01:03:04.355
- Sam's well?
- Yes.

01:03:05.122 --> 01:03:06.221
Why?

01:03:06.223 --> 01:03:09.623
Charlotte, you make it sound
like I have an agenda.

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:14.029
Well, and if I... If I did have a motive,
what might that be, do you think?

01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:15.964
- Ask yourself.
- Tell me.

01:03:15.966 --> 01:03:18.400
I think we've all
told you already.

01:03:18.402 --> 01:03:21.268
We've all told you, and you just
don't want to hear it, do you?

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.969
Who's "we"?

01:03:21.971 --> 01:03:24.205
All of us here in the office.

01:03:24.207 --> 01:03:27.208
Charlene, Terry, the Veigls.

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.179
Everybody.

01:03:29.645 --> 01:03:32.080
- We know you slept here.
- What?

01:03:32.082 --> 01:03:33.080
I do not sleep here!

01:03:33.082 --> 01:03:34.616
- Come on.
- Why would I sleep here?

01:03:34.618 --> 01:03:36.120
You slept here last night.

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.020
You sleep here often.

01:03:39.022 --> 01:03:40.091
Teri saw you.

01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:43.190
We know a lot of things.

01:03:43.192 --> 01:03:46.460
The Robinson report
was two weeks late.

01:03:46.462 --> 01:03:48.295
Fourteen days, Charlotte.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:50.397
This isn't just a box company.

01:03:50.399 --> 01:03:53.134
This place means a paycheck
for dozens of people.

01:03:53.136 --> 01:03:54.736
But it's more than that.

01:03:54.738 --> 01:03:56.207
It's stability.

01:03:56.707 --> 01:03:58.707
It's family.

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:01.076
- Don't jeopardize that.
- I'm sorry, I'm not following you.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:03.978
The things that we make here,
the boxes,

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.980
the various paper products,

01:04:05.982 --> 01:04:08.382
they're a necessary outcome.

01:04:08.384 --> 01:04:09.386
But our people?

01:04:10.053 --> 01:04:11.489
They're our lifeblood.

01:04:12.522 --> 01:04:14.625
Let me be frank, Charlotte.

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:17.525
You're becoming a liability.

01:04:17.527 --> 01:04:18.529
A liability?

01:04:19.161 --> 01:04:20.428
I am the hardest working...

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.563
I am the most
dedicated employee

01:04:22.565 --> 01:04:24.132
this company has ever seen.

01:04:24.134 --> 01:04:26.301
Success? That's a habit, yes.

01:04:26.303 --> 01:04:28.103
You have been,
I'm not denying that...

01:04:28.105 --> 01:04:29.069
You're denying reality.

01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:31.071
I mean, I appreciate,

01:04:31.073 --> 01:04:35.009
- but I don't have some kind of...
- Drinking problem.

01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:36.777
- You do.
- That's the last thing I have.

01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.214
People have come to me.

01:04:39.181 --> 01:04:41.252
Come to you? About what?

01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:43.118
Come to you.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.319
You don't know me.

01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:46.487
I do not have
a drinking problem.

01:04:46.489 --> 01:04:48.757
I drink socially, like a normal person.
Like you.

01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:53.164
How many bottles of gin in your
wastepaper basket, Charlotte?

01:04:53.797 --> 01:04:55.029
Five.

01:04:55.031 --> 01:04:56.165
That's right.

01:04:56.167 --> 01:04:59.103
You forgot to throw them out again.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.335
- Admit it.
- I...

01:05:01.337 --> 01:05:02.536
might have gone a little far.

01:05:02.538 --> 01:05:03.737
Admit it, Charlotte.

01:05:03.739 --> 01:05:05.105
It's excessive.

01:05:05.107 --> 01:05:07.208
It's destructive.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:08.478
How does Sam feel?

01:05:09.712 --> 01:05:10.747
Sam's gone.

01:05:11.814 --> 01:05:12.682
Cry, cry, cry.

01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.419
We can get through this.

01:05:16.819 --> 01:05:18.455
We can get
through this, because...

01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:21.225
Because we care
about each other.

01:05:22.392 --> 01:05:23.361
Say it with me.

01:05:25.728 --> 01:05:27.127
"We care about each other."

01:05:27.129 --> 01:05:28.265
We care about each other.

01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:32.232
I wanna help you,
and I'm going to.

01:05:32.234 --> 01:05:34.301
So all you have to do is...

01:05:35.238 --> 01:05:36.440
Show me how to do that.

01:05:37.107 --> 01:05:38.073
I don't know.

01:05:38.075 --> 01:05:39.509
I can't lose you.

01:05:41.544 --> 01:05:42.810
I...

01:05:42.812 --> 01:05:44.515
I need you, too, and...

01:05:45.681 --> 01:05:47.084
We need each other.

01:05:47.783 --> 01:05:49.716
So take some time.

01:05:49.718 --> 01:05:51.521
Take all the time
that you need.

01:05:52.522 --> 01:05:54.188
I just need some time.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:55.593
I'll be there for you.

01:05:56.526 --> 01:05:57.395
Here.

01:05:58.495 --> 01:05:59.697
I'm sorry.

01:06:00.596 --> 01:06:02.065
I really am trying.

01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:04.200
Me, too.

01:06:05.535 --> 01:06:07.103
Are you okay?

01:06:14.111 --> 01:06:15.513
She will be, Penny.

01:06:17.114 --> 01:06:18.115
She will be.

01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:42.172
We're taking a little break,
I guess.

01:06:42.739 --> 01:06:43.574
Great.

01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:45.276
Yeah.

01:06:58.888 --> 01:07:00.723
Hey. What's wrong?

01:07:01.591 --> 01:07:02.692
Look at me, okay?

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.528
Can I help?

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:10.200
If... If...
If we tighten the beginning...

01:07:12.368 --> 01:07:14.404
I... I like the part where...

01:07:18.241 --> 01:07:21.341
It's the same.
It's exactly the same.

01:07:21.343 --> 01:07:23.210
It's a first draft, we can...

01:07:23.212 --> 01:07:24.745
Nothing's changing.

01:07:24.747 --> 01:07:26.214
It's just...

01:07:26.216 --> 01:07:28.283
We can rewrite it.
Whatever you want.

01:07:28.285 --> 01:07:31.451
It's fucking crap.
It's fucking...

01:07:31.453 --> 01:07:33.690
- It's fucking...
- Audrey!

01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:36.290
Audrey!

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:38.194
This isn't good enough.

01:07:38.495 --> 01:07:40.562
Fuck.

01:07:40.564 --> 01:07:43.834
The way things are is fine
if you let things be fine.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.504
If you take care of yourself.

01:07:51.207 --> 01:07:52.272
I'm sorry, okay?

01:07:52.274 --> 01:07:53.741
It's fine.

01:07:53.743 --> 01:07:56.180
It's fine for me
to humiliate myself.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.379
That's what we're doing.

01:07:58.381 --> 01:08:01.248
That's what this is.
It's what we are.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.852
It's who I am, and I'm...

01:08:04.254 --> 01:08:05.756
I'm sick of being the...

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.357
Can't you see this?

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:12.228
I can't believe
you're doing this.

01:08:13.296 --> 01:08:15.629
This is deliberate.

01:08:15.631 --> 01:08:18.232
I don't know why
you're trying to hurt us.

01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:20.336
But it needs to stop.

01:08:24.573 --> 01:08:27.307
Where are you...
Where are you going? Where...

01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:28.609
I'm taking a bath.

01:08:28.612 --> 01:08:29.580
No, you're not.

01:08:31.313 --> 01:08:32.348
I'm just gonna take a bath.

01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:34.515
You're not going in there.

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:36.017
I don't know why
I can't take a bath.

01:08:36.019 --> 01:08:37.384
Tell me why I can't.

01:08:38.955 --> 01:08:39.823
Fuck you.

01:08:49.331 --> 01:08:50.767
Stop what
you're doing.

01:08:52.736 --> 01:08:54.636
Please. Please?

01:08:54.638 --> 01:08:56.473
Stop. Talk to me.

01:08:58.974 --> 01:09:00.643
Don't...

01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:07.714
Hey, asshole. We have
an obligation. This is a job.

01:09:07.716 --> 01:09:08.818
I quit!

01:09:09.919 --> 01:09:11.488
I need you!

01:09:19.763 --> 01:09:21.465
Get the fuck off me!

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:55.465
Thanks.

01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:17.421
Have I been mean to you?

01:10:18.054 --> 01:10:18.922
Today?

01:10:19.788 --> 01:10:20.823
In general.

01:10:21.558 --> 01:10:22.856
I have.

01:10:22.858 --> 01:10:25.860
I understand. I mean, hey.

01:10:25.862 --> 01:10:28.061
You get saddled with this girl
you don't even know

01:10:28.063 --> 01:10:31.365
for something you've been
working really hard on, too.

01:10:31.367 --> 01:10:33.770
I get it.
It's a tough position.

01:10:37.439 --> 01:10:38.308
Fuck.

01:10:38.974 --> 01:10:39.843
What is it?

01:10:49.786 --> 01:10:53.487
Green, like the color,
no "e" on the end.

01:10:53.489 --> 01:10:55.556
<i>And when did you
see her last?</i>

01:10:55.558 --> 01:10:56.790
Around four o'clock.

01:10:56.792 --> 01:11:00.561
<i>Well, a person isn't
legally considered missing</i>

01:11:00.563 --> 01:11:03.563
<i>until they've been gone
for at least 24 hours.</i>

01:11:03.565 --> 01:11:04.932
She doesn't have
her medication.

01:11:04.934 --> 01:11:08.402
<i>Honestly, there's
nothing we can do yet.</i>

01:11:08.404 --> 01:11:10.674
- <i>Medication?</i>
- Prescription.

01:11:11.974 --> 01:11:13.376
Anti-depressants.

01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:14.745
<i>Oh.</i>

01:11:15.879 --> 01:11:16.747
<i>I... I'm sorry.</i>

01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:22.583
<i>Hi,
you've reached Audrey Green.</i>

01:11:22.585 --> 01:11:24.421
<i>I'm sorry I can't take
your call right now...</i>

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:29.524
<i>Hi, you've reached
Audrey Green.</i>

01:11:29.526 --> 01:11:32.095
<i>I'm sorry I can't take
your call right now, but if...</i>

01:11:40.737 --> 01:11:42.570
<i>Hi, you've reached
Audrey Green.</i>

01:11:42.572 --> 01:11:44.739
<i>I'm sorry I can't take
your call right now,</i>

01:11:44.741 --> 01:11:47.040
<i>but if you leave a message, I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:48.946
<i>Thanks for calling
and have a great day.</i>

01:11:56.019 --> 01:11:56.887
Piper?

01:11:58.688 --> 01:11:59.556
Piper!

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:03.060
Piper.

01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:48.802
Hello, I'm from the agency.

01:12:48.804 --> 01:12:51.606
- May I come in?
- Of course.

01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:55.209
How much do you know about her
circumstances prior to being rescued?

01:12:55.211 --> 01:12:56.713
Not much, I'm afraid.

01:12:58.113 --> 01:13:00.146
It's not a very happy story.

01:13:00.148 --> 01:13:01.017
Oh?

01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:04.084
Suffice it to say
it'll be a while

01:13:04.086 --> 01:13:06.156
before she's able
to trust humans again.

01:13:06.989 --> 01:13:08.522
No.

01:13:08.524 --> 01:13:11.892
Yes, and that isn't to say
there isn't any hope.

01:13:11.894 --> 01:13:13.527
There is.

01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:16.129
But her progress
depends entirely on you.

01:13:16.131 --> 01:13:20.801
It's absolutely crucial that you make
yourself available to her emotionally.

01:13:20.803 --> 01:13:24.241
And, most important of all,
that you're patient with her.

01:13:25.642 --> 01:13:27.674
You cannot rush her recovery.

01:13:27.676 --> 01:13:29.813
This needs to be
a safe space for her.

01:13:32.549 --> 01:13:33.216
The cat?

01:13:35.684 --> 01:13:37.086
Yes, the cat.

01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:50.000
I thought they had a tendency
to land on their feet.

01:13:51.867 --> 01:13:53.970
It wouldn't have mattered
at this height.

01:13:55.772 --> 01:13:59.242
I guess cats can't really judge
that sort of thing, can they?

01:14:01.144 --> 01:14:04.114
Actually, their depth
perception is quite good.

01:14:05.614 --> 01:14:07.184
She did it on purpose.

01:14:10.286 --> 01:14:11.755
You mean, she jumped?

01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:17.924
Did you give her space?

01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:55.096
Hello?

01:14:55.098 --> 01:14:57.664
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:14:57.666 --> 01:14:59.268
<i>I didn't wake you, did I?</i>

01:15:01.403 --> 01:15:03.270
Nah... Um...

01:15:03.272 --> 01:15:04.938
Hey, June.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.973
No, what's going on?

01:15:06.975 --> 01:15:08.978
<i>Did you still
wanna do lunch today?</i>

01:15:10.045 --> 01:15:11.847
Oh, um...

01:15:13.315 --> 01:15:15.218
Sure. Where?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.229
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?

01:16:33.429 --> 01:16:36.830
Oh, um, I'm here to see June.

01:16:36.832 --> 01:16:38.365
Do you have an appointment?

01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:41.738
We're supposed to have lunch.
Um, I'm not sure if it's...

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.972
Uh, there's an audition
in progress.

01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:48.374
If you'd like to have a seat,
she'd just be a moment.

01:16:48.376 --> 01:16:50.477
Okay, thanks.

01:16:50.479 --> 01:16:52.780
- Is there a name I can give?
- Lillian.

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.515
- Sorry?
- Lillian.

01:16:54.517 --> 01:16:56.217
Perfect.
She'll just be a moment.

01:16:56.219 --> 01:16:56.784
Thank you.

01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:05.026
Would you like a tea?

01:17:05.028 --> 01:17:07.397
Or a coffee? Juice?
Anything like that?

01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.834
Uh, no, thanks.

01:17:11.466 --> 01:17:12.799
She'll just be a moment.

01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:13.834
Understood.

01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:16.035
Not quite what I heard,
but close enough.

01:17:16.037 --> 01:17:18.772
We should be able to let you know
within the next two weeks or so.

01:17:18.774 --> 01:17:20.775
- Great, thanks.
- Thank you, Darryl.

01:17:20.777 --> 01:17:22.245
Speak to you soon.

01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:24.244
Lillian, hey!

01:17:24.246 --> 01:17:26.880
Lillian, these are my
producers, Gil and Nuala.

01:17:26.882 --> 01:17:28.816
Lillian's a playwright.
She's unbelievable.

01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:30.785
- We went to school together.
- Oh, great.

01:17:30.787 --> 01:17:32.319
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

01:17:32.321 --> 01:17:34.420
I'll catch up with you guys later.
Ask about the Thursday.

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:35.789
- If you don't mind.
- That's good.

01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:37.158
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.392
Sorry, we're running a bit behind.
Do you mind if we order in?

01:17:39.394 --> 01:17:40.794
No, that's fine.

01:17:40.796 --> 01:17:42.362
I swear, I can't escape.

01:17:42.364 --> 01:17:45.966
Marcus, could you get us a couple of menus
from that Persian place downstairs?

01:17:45.968 --> 01:17:46.903
You bet.

01:17:48.336 --> 01:17:49.872
Okay, so that's that.

01:17:58.046 --> 01:18:00.884
Wow. This is
quite the operation.

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:03.883
She said glowingly.

01:18:03.885 --> 01:18:05.955
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:18:07.122 --> 01:18:09.856
I'm glad you remembered today.

01:18:09.858 --> 01:18:11.926
But if anybody's
gonna remember...

01:18:11.928 --> 01:18:14.460
Sorry, I feel so ignorant.

01:18:14.462 --> 01:18:16.429
What's all this for?

01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:19.900
This thing about the romantic
lives of scientists.

01:18:19.902 --> 01:18:20.904
Have I told you?

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:22.936
No.

01:18:22.938 --> 01:18:24.938
Really? That's unbelievable.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.073
I'm sorry.

01:18:26.075 --> 01:18:27.975
We're still just casting.

01:18:27.977 --> 01:18:30.180
You are so prolific lately.

01:18:30.912 --> 01:18:32.482
Well, you, too.

01:18:33.849 --> 01:18:36.917
Listen, I have something
I wanna ask you.

01:18:36.919 --> 01:18:38.488
It's not easy for me.

01:18:40.922 --> 01:18:42.088
Do you need some money?

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:44.861
No! No, nothing like that.

01:18:46.895 --> 01:18:49.832
Wow, this is
always so hard. Uh...

01:18:51.934 --> 01:18:54.437
I value your opinion a lot.

01:18:55.237 --> 01:18:56.405
As you know.

01:18:58.206 --> 01:18:59.075
What is it?

01:19:00.977 --> 01:19:04.043
I finished a new draft
of this thing, this...

01:19:04.045 --> 01:19:06.614
Conference thing,
and I would love it

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:08.147
if you'd maybe give it a read?

01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:10.884
If you want,
if you have time.

01:19:10.886 --> 01:19:12.319
I'd be honored!

01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:14.888
You never
send me anything anymore.

01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:17.091
My stuff is nothing
compared to what you do.

01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:19.259
Don't even start with that.

01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:22.232
I should be more pragmatic,
if we're being honest.

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:26.600
Is this all of it?

01:19:26.602 --> 01:19:28.168
There's a seven-minute cap.

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:30.003
Anyway, uh, take a look at it

01:19:30.005 --> 01:19:31.638
when you have a minute,

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.542
and let me know what you think.

01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:36.276
Why don't I just read it
right now?

01:19:36.278 --> 01:19:38.378
That's really not necessary.

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.980
Don't be silly.
It'll take a few minutes.

01:19:39.982 --> 01:19:41.618
It's gotta happen
sometime, right?

01:19:43.586 --> 01:19:44.521
Okay.

01:20:57.425 --> 01:20:58.428
Hmm.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.304
Okay, let me just...

01:21:09.371 --> 01:21:13.339
In the broadest
possible strokes, okay?

01:21:13.341 --> 01:21:16.744
Are you absolutely locked
into this duration?

01:21:16.746 --> 01:21:20.780
Seven minutes just doesn't really seem
like enough time to turn a drunk around.

01:21:20.782 --> 01:21:21.718
Does it?

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:27.087
I don't dislike it,

01:21:27.089 --> 01:21:28.222
if that's what's coming across.

01:21:28.224 --> 01:21:30.660
Considering the constraints,
I think it's pretty good.

01:21:32.661 --> 01:21:34.364
I like how earnest it is.

01:21:36.131 --> 01:21:37.366
Has she come in yet?

01:21:40.269 --> 01:21:41.401
Oh.

01:21:41.403 --> 01:21:44.540
Audrey. This morning, actually.

01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:47.473
She didn't tell you?

01:21:47.475 --> 01:21:48.978
How was she?

01:21:50.145 --> 01:21:51.982
She was fantastic.

01:21:53.181 --> 01:21:54.550
She didn't tell you?

01:21:56.218 --> 01:22:00.119
I think you guys'll
work well together.

01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:04.158
Well, we still have a couple
more days of auditions, so...

01:22:04.993 --> 01:22:06.226
June,
sorry to interrupt.

01:22:06.228 --> 01:22:07.330
It's five to 2:00.

01:22:08.063 --> 01:22:09.231
Thanks, Marcus.

01:22:26.148 --> 01:22:27.684
I really like it.

01:25:08.077 --> 01:25:12.411
"Behold, God's son is come
unto this land of Thebes.

01:25:12.413 --> 01:25:13.847
Even I, Dionysus,

01:25:13.849 --> 01:25:17.287
whom the brand of heaven's
hot splendor lit to life..."

01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:23.423
What are you doing here?

01:25:23.425 --> 01:25:25.195
Hi, Lillian.

01:25:26.028 --> 01:25:27.597
Any word from Audrey?

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:33.236
Do you still wanna rehearse?

01:25:34.269 --> 01:25:36.436
You have one line.

01:25:36.438 --> 01:25:38.741
Well, I still think
it could be useful.

01:25:40.376 --> 01:25:42.542
I brought wine.

01:25:42.544 --> 01:25:45.712
Honestly, I don't even know
why I'm surprised anymore.

01:25:45.714 --> 01:25:47.981
I'm under
so much pressure, right?

01:25:47.983 --> 01:25:50.316
I'm so supportive of her.

01:25:50.318 --> 01:25:52.485
She wants to change
every little anything.

01:25:52.487 --> 01:25:55.388
- But I don't complain. Do you see me complain?
- No.

01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:57.057
I spent a ton of time

01:25:57.059 --> 01:26:00.360
on this... Writing this shit,
and still I don't complain,

01:26:00.362 --> 01:26:03.496
because the most important
thing is that she's happy.

01:26:03.498 --> 01:26:05.464
- Yes.
- And I'm sorry

01:26:05.466 --> 01:26:07.066
if I'm not who
she wants me to be.

01:26:07.068 --> 01:26:10.870
I'm sorry if certain realities
impinge on the art of the thing.

01:26:10.872 --> 01:26:14.441
- But that's why reality's reality enough.
- Uh-huh.

01:26:14.443 --> 01:26:16.410
- Are you sure you should...
- My thing is this.

01:26:16.412 --> 01:26:18.678
Regardless of how believable
it is on the page,

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.480
you make it work.

01:26:20.482 --> 01:26:22.415
If a person has agreed
to take a role,

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:24.487
- then is it not reasonable to expect that...
- Lillian!

01:26:26.654 --> 01:26:29.955
I think we should discuss
a plan of action,

01:26:29.957 --> 01:26:32.793
in the event that Audrey...

01:26:32.795 --> 01:26:35.762
- Doesn't show.
- I'm not talking about this with you.

01:26:35.764 --> 01:26:38.565
Lillian, this isn't about
you and me right now, okay?

01:26:38.567 --> 01:26:40.834
- This is our job.
- Are you accusing me of being unprofessional?

01:26:40.836 --> 01:26:43.704
- I'm just saying-
- You are a minor child.

01:26:43.706 --> 01:26:46.972
- I'm just saying a back-up plan...
- There is no back-up plan!

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:51.578
Do you understand?
She's it. She's all we have.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.415
If she doesn't show,
the plan is we're fucked.

01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:58.785
End of story,
end of discussion.

01:26:58.787 --> 01:27:00.423
End of career.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.795
Not necessarily.

01:27:06.562 --> 01:27:07.430
Oh?

01:27:12.934 --> 01:27:15.602
I've been practicing this thing
for nearly a week now,

01:27:15.604 --> 01:27:17.536
- and I know every word of it.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:17.538 --> 01:27:18.605
- Every word.
- No.

01:27:18.607 --> 01:27:22.441
Face it, Lil. Audrey never
understood this thing.

01:27:22.443 --> 01:27:23.946
She never appreciated
your writing.

01:27:25.013 --> 01:27:26.783
She took off on you, okay?

01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:28.084
She left.

01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:31.852
But I'm here.

01:27:31.854 --> 01:27:34.957
If you take this chance on me,
I swear, I'll do you justice.

01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:41.331
You don't have
a lot of options.

01:27:46.501 --> 01:27:49.004
- Are you okay?
- You should go.

01:27:53.075 --> 01:27:54.607
You have to go.

01:27:54.609 --> 01:27:56.446
I'm asking you to go.

01:27:58.147 --> 01:27:59.614
I care about you.

01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:00.950
Go.

01:28:08.424 --> 01:28:09.524
I like you.

01:28:10.858 --> 01:28:11.960
I'm telling you.

01:28:12.827 --> 01:28:14.496
I really like you.

01:28:15.596 --> 01:28:16.465
A lot.

01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:20.370
You don't wanna say this.

01:28:31.447 --> 01:28:33.815
What do you do
when you feel like this?

01:28:38.487 --> 01:28:40.590
Well, this is tragic, isn't it?

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:10.610
- You guys good? Can I get you something?
- No. Thanks, Gary.

01:30:10.612 --> 01:30:12.012
Where's Audrey?

01:30:12.014 --> 01:30:13.579
Gary, you're up in five.

01:30:13.581 --> 01:30:15.682
Okay, gotcha.

01:30:15.684 --> 01:30:16.919
Where's Audrey?

01:30:21.023 --> 01:30:22.859
Where is Audrey?

01:30:30.698 --> 01:30:33.165
Hey, asshole,
we have an obligation.

01:30:33.167 --> 01:30:35.000
- This is a job!
- I quit.

01:30:35.002 --> 01:30:36.538
I need you.

01:30:40.576 --> 01:30:42.245
Get the fuck off me.

01:31:29.724 --> 01:31:32.625
Is there skiing at this thing?
Do we know?

01:31:36.998 --> 01:31:39.065
It's Bradley.

01:31:39.067 --> 01:31:40.269
<i>Bradley, there's
an Audrey here to see you.</i>

01:31:45.741 --> 01:31:47.176
Send her up.

01:31:48.743 --> 01:31:50.078
Who's Audrey?

01:31:54.349 --> 01:31:55.818
Who's Audrey?

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.956
Who's Audrey?

01:32:03.992 --> 01:32:05.161
Who's Audrey?

01:32:12.701 --> 01:32:14.904
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:32:16.737 --> 01:32:17.939
How are you?

01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:20.809
Uh...

01:32:22.309 --> 01:32:23.979
Gosh, um...

01:32:27.715 --> 01:32:29.017
You going somewhere?

01:32:31.687 --> 01:32:34.454
Yeah, um...

01:32:34.456 --> 01:32:37.257
- Let's talk in here.
- That sounds nice.

01:32:37.259 --> 01:32:38.661
Yeah.

01:32:42.197 --> 01:32:43.862
So, where're you headed?

01:32:43.864 --> 01:32:48.034
Oh, uh, just some conference
up north.

01:32:48.036 --> 01:32:52.771
Everybody has to go. Uh, do you need to get...

01:32:52.773 --> 01:32:54.807
Yeah, look, we had a...
We had a fight,

01:32:54.809 --> 01:32:58.712
uh, with Lillian and...

01:32:58.714 --> 01:33:01.384
- I don't really have anywhere to stay.
- Okay.

01:33:03.285 --> 01:33:04.718
Can I stay at your place?

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.419
- I'm not sure...
- Just for a day or two, uh...

01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:11.960
I know it's... Yeah, I could...
I could borrow your key or...

01:33:13.194 --> 01:33:14.828
I'll take really good
care of it.

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:16.064
I mean, you won't even know
I was there.

01:33:17.866 --> 01:33:18.968
Sorry.

01:33:20.402 --> 01:33:21.801
I'm not gonna go.

01:33:21.803 --> 01:33:23.902
No. No, you don't have
to do that. I Just...

01:33:23.904 --> 01:33:27.242
No, no. It's not like I don't
trust you or anything like that.

01:33:28.876 --> 01:33:30.310
If you're having a hard time,

01:33:30.312 --> 01:33:35.984
I'm not just gonna run off
and leave you here alone.

01:33:36.751 --> 01:33:38.453
Really?

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.955
Well, don't you have to go?

01:33:42.858 --> 01:33:45.225
I mean, it's just some stupid
conference,

01:33:45.227 --> 01:33:47.494
like who cares, right?

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:50.864
Uh,
shuttle's here, Brad.

01:33:50.866 --> 01:33:52.902
This will be great for us.

01:33:58.072 --> 01:33:59.407
Yeah.

01:34:01.809 --> 01:34:03.879
The shuttles here, Brad.

01:34:14.421 --> 01:34:15.924
Taking off.

01:34:18.859 --> 01:34:20.962
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:27.499
Act normal. Act normal. If you run too
fast, then people'll know you're guilty.

01:35:13.514 --> 01:35:14.849
So this is the place.

01:35:16.952 --> 01:35:18.387
It's really nice.

01:35:19.987 --> 01:35:22.825
Yeah, I know.
I'm very lucky.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.194
Feel free to put your...

01:35:28.196 --> 01:35:31.129
- I guess you don't really have stuff, do you?
- Nope.

01:35:31.131 --> 01:35:32.300
Cool.

01:35:34.903 --> 01:35:37.236
- This couch folds out.
- Oh.

01:35:37.238 --> 01:35:38.472
I'm gonna get
started on dinner.

01:35:38.474 --> 01:35:42.144
- So, uh, make yourself comfortable, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

01:35:49.384 --> 01:35:50.586
This is really good.

01:35:51.886 --> 01:35:53.154
You do that a lot?

01:35:53.988 --> 01:35:54.820
Yeah, all the time.

01:35:54.822 --> 01:35:56.923
Is that
a bed and breakfast thing?

01:35:56.925 --> 01:35:59.191
- No, I think it's more of a survival thing.
- I don't. I'm alive.

01:35:59.193 --> 01:36:02.027
- I noticed that earlier.
- You're good.

01:36:02.029 --> 01:36:03.896
Yeah, it's in the eyes.

01:36:03.898 --> 01:36:06.365
- I need more time to be sure.
- Oh, yeah?

01:36:06.367 --> 01:36:07.902
Yeah.

01:36:23.018 --> 01:36:25.584
There it is. Totally alive.

01:36:25.586 --> 01:36:27.085
Dead give away there
at the end.

01:36:27.087 --> 01:36:31.124
- Well, I'm an actress.
- Really, professionally?

01:36:31.126 --> 01:36:34.396
- So is Brad, you know.
- Bradley's like a last name though.

01:36:35.663 --> 01:36:37.963
- It's my name.
- What does it mean?

01:36:37.965 --> 01:36:39.298
I've no idea.

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.101
- It doesn't signify anything?
- Not that I know of.

01:36:42.103 --> 01:36:44.473
- What does your name mean?
- Noble strength.

01:36:46.006 --> 01:36:48.274
I'd say
that's pretty accurate.

01:36:48.276 --> 01:36:50.144
You don't know
a lot about me.

01:36:51.112 --> 01:36:52.915
Just giving you my impression.

01:37:17.037 --> 01:37:19.007
You are not going to fuck me
around, are you?

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.576
Okay.

01:37:54.108 --> 01:37:56.275
I've got
somewhere to be.

01:37:56.277 --> 01:37:59.948
And I'm not there
and I've never felt better.

01:38:01.049 --> 01:38:03.149
- Have you seen <i>Caribou</i> yet?
- No.

01:38:03.151 --> 01:38:07.355
It's playing at The Review at 3:20.
Can you make that?

01:38:08.089 --> 01:38:09.625
Let me check my schedule.

01:38:16.264 --> 01:38:17.299
Hmm.

01:38:27.742 --> 01:38:28.677
Hello.

01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:31.080
Yes, yes, it is.

01:38:32.781 --> 01:38:34.183
Yes, I can.

01:38:37.051 --> 01:38:38.720
You know, just...
Just one minute.

01:38:43.058 --> 01:38:44.259
Okay, go ahead.

01:38:46.361 --> 01:38:47.462
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:48.395 --> 01:38:49.564
Right, right.

01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:54.136
Okay. Great.
Got it, thank you.

01:38:55.202 --> 01:38:58.639
Thank you so much.
See you then. Bye-bye.

01:38:59.706 --> 01:39:02.374
- Yes!
- What is it?

01:39:02.376 --> 01:39:04.612
Do you have a printer?
Of course, you do.

01:39:09.818 --> 01:39:12.819
- Do you still want to do the movie?
- What time?

01:39:12.821 --> 01:39:14.820
- 3:20.
- Yeah, I can do that.

01:39:14.822 --> 01:39:16.388
- All right.
- Okay.

01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:18.723
- It's at The Review.
- Uh-huh.

01:39:18.725 --> 01:39:20.295
- I'll get tickets.
- Yeah.

01:39:23.497 --> 01:39:26.801
Need to understand.
Do you understand?

01:39:38.212 --> 01:39:39.478
Audrey?

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.146
Hannan.

01:39:41.148 --> 01:39:46.054
I'm back home for a bit
with my parents, you know.

01:39:46.688 --> 01:39:48.353
Don't laugh at me, Hannan.

01:39:48.355 --> 01:39:50.522
Don't laugh at the work
and don't laugh at me.

01:39:50.524 --> 01:39:52.825
Oh, it's just for a while
till I get stuff figured out.

01:39:52.827 --> 01:39:55.261
You know thousands of people
want to do what you do.

01:39:55.263 --> 01:39:57.463
And they never will, never.

01:39:57.465 --> 01:40:01.534
- Good for them. This is good for me.
- You're wrong.

01:40:01.536 --> 01:40:03.835
I need to and you don't know
what I need.

01:40:03.837 --> 01:40:06.138
No, listen, you're so wrong.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.277
We could work on this together.

01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:13.148
- Did June ask you to come in?
- No.

01:40:14.148 --> 01:40:15.382
I applied like everybody else.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:19.451
And I'm auditioning like everybody else.
Except, better.

01:40:19.453 --> 01:40:20.555
Hmm.

01:40:24.893 --> 01:40:26.295
This way.

01:40:32.233 --> 01:40:33.535
She's already casted.

01:40:35.403 --> 01:40:37.436
What?

01:40:37.438 --> 01:40:41.707
They just have to do these open
calls so they're eligible for grants.

01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:45.945
It's just gonna be the
regulars. Steph, Mark, David...

01:40:45.947 --> 01:40:48.280
- You?
- No. Uh...

01:40:48.282 --> 01:40:50.451
I'm just reading
those people as a favor.

01:40:51.885 --> 01:40:53.455
After this, I'm done.

01:40:55.956 --> 01:40:57.459
Really?

01:40:58.725 --> 01:41:01.263
Yeah.

01:41:06.466 --> 01:41:10.302
- Hey, Audrey, so glad you could make it.
- Me too.

01:41:10.304 --> 01:41:12.540
Hi, pleasure.

01:41:13.675 --> 01:41:15.344
Thank you.

01:41:18.379 --> 01:41:19.614
Hey, Audrey.

01:41:20.547 --> 01:41:22.384
Would you rather sit or stand?

01:41:23.218 --> 01:41:24.519
I'll stand.

01:41:26.554 --> 01:41:29.858
Okay. We'd love to see
how to tackle this.

01:41:36.898 --> 01:41:38.267
Whenever you're ready.

01:41:39.334 --> 01:41:42.000
"I'd asked you where
you been but I already know.

01:41:42.002 --> 01:41:44.570
Out, not here.
Tell me, I'm wrong."

01:41:44.572 --> 01:41:46.304
You're gonna tell me anyway.

01:41:46.306 --> 01:41:48.374
"That machine means
more to you than me."

01:41:48.376 --> 01:41:51.276
It does, okay. It does.

01:41:51.278 --> 01:41:54.312
What are you?
Are you the cure for cancer?

01:41:54.314 --> 01:41:55.815
"Sure. Sure.
Say that."

01:41:55.817 --> 01:41:59.352
I'm helping more people
than you can understand.

01:41:59.354 --> 01:42:02.021
We are all part of this cycle.

01:42:02.023 --> 01:42:04.356
We are all the same thing.

01:42:04.358 --> 01:42:09.695
There will be 11 billion people on
this planet within our lifetime.

01:42:09.697 --> 01:42:13.468
And they will all be asking,
"Why we didn't do more?

01:42:14.469 --> 01:42:17.369
What were we thinking?"

01:42:17.371 --> 01:42:19.340
And I will have
to tell them something.

01:42:20.375 --> 01:42:24.377
You are not the answer
I will give them.

01:42:24.379 --> 01:42:26.381
You are not that something.

01:42:27.415 --> 01:42:28.481
Do you understand?

01:42:28.483 --> 01:42:31.520
- "I'm not asking..."
- Do you understand?

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.042
<i>Hi, you've
reached the office of Peter Fielding.</i>

01:42:56.044 --> 01:42:57.877
<i>I'm afraid I can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

01:42:57.879 --> 01:43:00.512
<i>so please leave a message after the
tone and I'll get back to you soon.</i>

01:43:00.514 --> 01:43:02.350
<i>Bye for now.</i>

01:43:13.694 --> 01:43:15.427
Everyone's upset.

01:43:15.429 --> 01:43:18.063
I'm upset. You are.

01:43:18.065 --> 01:43:20.568
I can only imagine how Charles
and Louis are feeling.

01:43:21.868 --> 01:43:25.570
He...
He's on a call right now.

01:43:25.572 --> 01:43:27.308
And that I will see them.

01:43:28.876 --> 01:43:31.446
I'm... I'm gonna call you back.
I'm calling you back.

01:43:32.546 --> 01:43:34.646
Audrey, I was kind of
in the middle of a...

01:43:34.648 --> 01:43:36.718
Peter, is your job a challenge?

01:43:37.585 --> 01:43:38.718
I don't know what you mean.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.521
Or do you find it very
difficult here at the agency?

01:43:42.523 --> 01:43:45.458
If I found it all that difficult,
I wouldn't still be here,

01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.360
would I, Audrey?
How are you?

01:43:48.362 --> 01:43:49.895
Wonderful. Great.

01:43:49.897 --> 01:43:54.533
So, when you go home,
do you have to decompress?

01:43:54.535 --> 01:43:56.369
- What do you do?
- What is this?

01:43:56.371 --> 01:43:58.536
You play squash?

01:43:58.538 --> 01:44:00.004
What is this?

01:44:00.006 --> 01:44:03.008
It strikes me that you
are not doing your job.

01:44:03.010 --> 01:44:06.411
And it strikes me that I don't
feel too great about that.

01:44:06.413 --> 01:44:08.446
I went too easy on you.
I see that now.

01:44:08.448 --> 01:44:10.082
I thought, you know,
it's a tough racket.

01:44:10.084 --> 01:44:11.517
This guy is under
a lot of pressure.

01:44:11.519 --> 01:44:13.386
But apparently
that is not true.

01:44:13.388 --> 01:44:15.553
Apparently,
you are just incompetent.

01:44:15.555 --> 01:44:17.123
Please don't talk to me
like that, Audrey.

01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:19.557
When was the last time
you put me up for anything?

01:44:19.559 --> 01:44:21.427
It has been months
since I've heard from you.

01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:22.427
You don't even return my calls.

01:44:22.429 --> 01:44:24.763
- Has your number changed?
- No!

01:44:24.765 --> 01:44:27.133
I've been under
a lot of stress lately.

01:44:27.135 --> 01:44:29.768
- I could...
- How hard is it for you to just put me up!

01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:32.570
Argh! I put you up Audrey. I put you
up for anything and everything.

01:44:32.572 --> 01:44:34.874
Ten years younger, ten years older.
I put you up for all of it.

01:44:34.876 --> 01:44:36.609
They just don't hire you
and I'm sorry.

01:44:36.611 --> 01:44:39.547
I can't force them to hire you.
I don't do miracles.

01:44:40.982 --> 01:44:45.787
Sorry. That was harsh.
Miracles is harsh.

01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.553
You're fired.

01:44:48.555 --> 01:44:51.589
Okay? Because I can
do this on my own.

01:44:51.591 --> 01:44:53.562
That is the miracle here.

01:44:55.529 --> 01:44:58.399
Look at me, Peter!
I'm a miracle.

01:45:21.922 --> 01:45:23.425
Doesn't matter.

01:45:40.541 --> 01:45:42.577
I'm so sorry.

01:45:48.582 --> 01:45:50.749
How was the audition?

01:46:00.627 --> 01:46:02.764
My boss called today.

01:46:04.665 --> 01:46:06.966
Are you in trouble?

01:46:06.968 --> 01:46:08.769
I don't know.
I didn't answer it.

01:46:13.273 --> 01:46:14.875
Have I ruined things for you?

01:46:16.544 --> 01:46:17.645
Possibly.

01:46:20.147 --> 01:46:21.183
Can I come in?

01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:24.152
Of course.

01:47:16.903 --> 01:47:20.741
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

01:47:22.843 --> 01:47:24.778
Thanks again for everything.

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.616
My pleasure.

01:47:33.653 --> 01:47:35.721
Wanna do this again, sometime,

01:47:35.723 --> 01:47:38.824
whatever this was.

01:47:38.826 --> 01:47:40.895
Are you busy
in the next little while?

01:47:42.295 --> 01:47:45.533
Not if I've been fired.

01:47:47.734 --> 01:47:50.604
- You have my number?
- Yeah.

01:48:01.616 --> 01:48:03.818
- See you later.
- I hope so.

01:49:26.767 --> 01:49:29.837
- Can I refill you?
- No.

01:51:48.007 --> 01:51:49.210
Thank you.

01:51:57.318 --> 01:51:58.787
What a day.

01:52:02.956 --> 01:52:07.392
So many... So many terrific speakers
from... From all over the country,

01:52:07.394 --> 01:52:12.496
and from England,
even one from England.

01:52:12.498 --> 01:52:15.267
My name is, is Gary Milford.

01:52:15.269 --> 01:52:20.304
Uh, and I'm here
to talk about leadership.

01:52:20.306 --> 01:52:25.009
Everybody wants to be a leader.
Don't they?

01:52:25.011 --> 01:52:27.913
When things are well,
uh, when...

01:52:27.915 --> 01:52:32.618
When business is good then...
Then sure that's the ticket.

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.889
But... What about
when they are not?

01:52:38.024 --> 01:52:41.325
It's just you and me, you know.

01:52:41.327 --> 01:52:44.195
That's it.
That's all there is.

01:52:44.197 --> 01:52:47.966
Before I begin, I wanna...
I wanna bring up, uh,

01:52:47.968 --> 01:52:51.369
two very talented young ladies

01:52:51.371 --> 01:52:54.106
and, and my niece Fiona,

01:52:54.108 --> 01:52:57.042
who's only 17 years old,
if you can believe it.

01:52:57.044 --> 01:52:59.311
I know I can't.

01:52:59.313 --> 01:53:02.481
And they are, uh,

01:53:02.483 --> 01:53:06.517
going to play out a scenario
familiar to any manager

01:53:06.519 --> 01:53:09.320
worth his or her salt,

01:53:09.322 --> 01:53:13.327
that of having an employee
who's got troubles.

01:53:15.095 --> 01:53:17.932
How does one to begin to help?

01:53:18.631 --> 01:53:20.632
That's the question.

01:53:20.634 --> 01:53:22.968
So, without any further ado,

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:26.038
uh, Audrey, Lillian,

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.339
and young Fiona,

01:53:28.341 --> 01:53:33.881
uh, with "Leadership in Times
of Crisis and Change."

01:55:20.153 --> 01:55:22.723
Come in.

01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:26.327
Charlotte.

01:55:28.327 --> 01:55:30.195
- Charlotte.
- Ms. Watkins.

01:55:30.197 --> 01:55:32.830
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

01:55:32.832 --> 01:55:34.499
I don't know where my mind was.

01:55:34.501 --> 01:55:38.473
- Perfectly fine. Good morning.
- Good morning. Hi.

01:55:39.505 --> 01:55:42.542
They said you wanted to see me.
Penny said.

01:55:44.178 --> 01:55:46.210
- Water, Charlotte?
- Should I?

01:55:46.212 --> 01:55:48.015
- May I?
- Please.

01:55:52.685 --> 01:55:54.788
- Sit down.
- Okay. Fine.

01:55:56.189 --> 01:55:57.759
Penny said right.

01:55:59.559 --> 01:56:01.763
- Water, Charlotte?
- You already asked me that.

01:56:06.132 --> 01:56:08.635
- How are things, Charlotte?
- Things?

01:56:10.537 --> 01:56:12.236
Things domestic.

01:56:12.238 --> 01:56:15.339
Things at home,
uh, things personal.

01:56:15.341 --> 01:56:18.209
- Things good?
- I'm sorry, is this not work related?

01:56:18.211 --> 01:56:20.212
Is this personal?

01:56:20.214 --> 01:56:22.880
Home life?
Life at home.

01:56:22.882 --> 01:56:24.352
Why do you ask?

01:56:25.519 --> 01:56:29.420
- Can I please, just say a few...
- I would like you to.

01:56:29.422 --> 01:56:31.255
Okay.

01:56:31.257 --> 01:56:33.357
- How's Sam?
- Sam's gone.

01:56:33.359 --> 01:56:36.160
Sam's just fine.
Why do you care?

01:56:36.162 --> 01:56:39.865
Charlotte, you make it sound as
if I have some kind of an agenda.

01:56:39.867 --> 01:56:42.770
Why is that funny?

01:56:44.304 --> 01:56:46.271
Well, even if I did
have a motive,

01:56:46.273 --> 01:56:48.539
what might that be,
do you think, ask yourself.

01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:51.343
- It's your motive.
- I think...

01:56:51.345 --> 01:56:53.277
I think you already know.

01:56:53.279 --> 01:56:56.213
I think we've told you and you just
don't want to hear it, do you?

01:56:56.215 --> 01:57:00.418
You're right.
You're really, really, right.

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:02.920
Well, we are certainly glad
to hear that you really...

01:57:02.922 --> 01:57:04.358
Who's "we"?

01:57:05.291 --> 01:57:06.460
Everybody.

01:57:07.294 --> 01:57:09.160
Everybody in the office.

01:57:09.162 --> 01:57:14.399
- Charlene, Terry, the Veigls, everybody.
- Oh... Oh.

01:57:14.401 --> 01:57:19.107
And they are unhappy.
It's terrible. Tragic.

01:57:23.343 --> 01:57:25.944
- Did you eat?
- I went out.

01:57:25.946 --> 01:57:27.378
Oh, you did.

01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:29.080
I'm eating well, okay.

01:57:29.082 --> 01:57:33.218
I have access to clean water. In the grand
scheme of things, I'm remarkable lucky.

01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:36.221
What do you want me to say?
I'm grateful.

01:57:36.223 --> 01:57:38.190
- I know you slept here?
- What?

01:57:38.192 --> 01:57:39.824
Don't be absurd.

01:57:39.826 --> 01:57:43.360
You slept in your office last night.
You sleep here often.

01:57:43.362 --> 01:57:46.263
Where would I sleep?
There's no bed. Stop it!

01:57:46.265 --> 01:57:47.567
Terry saw you.

01:57:48.734 --> 01:57:50.569
You take his word over mine?

01:57:50.571 --> 01:57:52.937
We've noticed a lot of things,
Charlotte.

01:57:52.939 --> 01:57:55.272
The Robinson report
was two weeks...

01:57:55.274 --> 01:57:56.307
That's right.
Tell me about my work.

01:57:56.309 --> 01:57:57.743
Two weeks late.

01:57:57.745 --> 01:58:01.745
- Your work has been questionable for such...
- Questionable? Really?

01:58:01.747 --> 01:58:03.615
Really?

01:58:03.617 --> 01:58:06.517
Frankly, Charlotte,
some of us...

01:58:06.519 --> 01:58:08.520
Some of us are beginning
to think that you might

01:58:08.522 --> 01:58:12.492
very well have
a drinking problem.

01:58:13.926 --> 01:58:15.362
I don't have
a drinking problem.

01:58:16.996 --> 01:58:19.364
- I...
- Tell me.

01:58:19.366 --> 01:58:22.366
- I...
- Be strong.

01:58:22.368 --> 01:58:24.869
Be decisive.
Tell me about myself.

01:58:24.871 --> 01:58:26.404
Lead by example.

01:58:26.406 --> 01:58:28.306
- Why are you doing this?
- That's good.

01:58:28.308 --> 01:58:30.475
That's real.
That's a genuine response.

01:58:30.477 --> 01:58:34.812
- Please don't do this to me.
- To us.

01:58:34.814 --> 01:58:37.548
I just want us
to talk to each other.

01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:40.754
So you talk.
You have the floor.

01:58:42.723 --> 01:58:44.856
Should I go first? Okay.

01:58:44.858 --> 01:58:51.362
First, I think that you are
incredibly insecure and petty.

01:58:51.364 --> 01:58:53.330
Bourbon, I find it helps.

01:58:53.332 --> 01:58:56.368
Take this off, God damn it!
Stop fucking hiding.

01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:58.436
- Unbelievable.
- You never should have...

01:58:58.438 --> 01:59:01.873
- Why do you need me?
- What?

01:59:01.875 --> 01:59:05.377
I wanna know why you need me?

01:59:05.379 --> 01:59:06.578
Tell me why?

01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:10.015
- Jesus.
- I'm such a mess.

01:59:10.017 --> 01:59:13.752
I'm a train wreck.
I'm a fucking disaster, why?

01:59:13.754 --> 01:59:16.987
- Oh, God. I don't.
- Why are you so afraid to let me go?

01:59:16.989 --> 01:59:18.490
- I'm not.
- Let me go.

01:59:18.492 --> 01:59:20.325
- You wanna go?
- Get rid of me.

01:59:20.327 --> 01:59:21.558
Go walk out.
There's the door. Go!

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.994
You're always telling me
to think about us.

01:59:22.996 --> 01:59:25.797
Think about the business. But none
of this is actually about me, is it?

01:59:25.799 --> 01:59:28.932
It's always about you.
Everything is about you.

01:59:28.934 --> 01:59:32.369
Are you happy with the work?
Do you like it?

01:59:32.371 --> 01:59:33.871
Are you happy or sad?

01:59:33.873 --> 01:59:36.607
- Oh, and you control all of that.
- Oh, do I?

01:59:36.609 --> 01:59:39.744
I think you're the one
who controls everything.

01:59:39.746 --> 01:59:43.714
I'm not going to apologize for
worrying when you disappear.

01:59:43.716 --> 01:59:47.819
When you jeopardize my career,
our career.

01:59:47.821 --> 01:59:52.859
The fact is you can't handle
the realities of this business.

01:59:54.961 --> 01:59:57.395
Uh...

01:59:57.397 --> 01:59:59.731
- The reality of this business is that its nothing without me.
- You can't handle reality!

01:59:59.733 --> 02:00:02.033
The reality is, I'm the one
that keeps us working.

02:00:02.035 --> 02:00:04.335
- I'm the one.
- How have you dealt with it before?

02:00:04.337 --> 02:00:08.440
- I gave up so much. I gave up so much for you.
- How are you dealing now?

02:00:08.442 --> 02:00:10.778
Did you?

02:00:11.711 --> 02:00:14.482
Tell me
about these opportunities.

02:00:16.416 --> 02:00:18.516
What were they?

02:00:18.518 --> 02:00:21.352
Who are these people
who gave them to you?

02:00:21.354 --> 02:00:23.355
Um, are they here with us now?

02:00:23.357 --> 02:00:24.923
Can you...
Can you hear them?

02:00:24.925 --> 02:00:26.557
What are they saying?

02:00:26.559 --> 02:00:29.694
I'm the best employee
this company has ever had.

02:00:29.696 --> 02:00:33.698
Maybe you were once before
but that isn't the case anymore.

02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.901
- Your heart's just not in it anymore.
- It's not.

02:00:36.903 --> 02:00:38.436
Okay, it's not.

02:00:38.438 --> 02:00:41.740
And why should it be?
We never wanted to be here.

02:00:41.742 --> 02:00:45.043
You did it. Whatever, whatever
you tell yourself now.

02:00:45.045 --> 02:00:47.547
You...
We were better than this.

02:00:48.814 --> 02:00:50.615
So, why are you here?

02:00:50.617 --> 02:00:53.421
Did you just show up
to bitch about all this?

02:00:55.455 --> 02:01:00.124
You know what,
I don't even care.

02:01:00.126 --> 02:01:02.960
Okay, so this isn't the...
This isn't the life you wanted.

02:01:02.962 --> 02:01:06.097
This isn't the life I wanted
either but you're here.

02:01:06.099 --> 02:01:09.500
You're working. So just
act like a fucking professional.

02:01:09.502 --> 02:01:11.503
I'm not here for you.

02:01:11.505 --> 02:01:13.873
- I'm not here for you.
- Just pretend.

02:01:14.974 --> 02:01:17.409
You know what,

02:01:17.411 --> 02:01:20.445
you are a fucking train wreck

02:01:20.447 --> 02:01:24.015
and I can't
handle it anymore.

02:01:24.017 --> 02:01:28.555
Just get it together.
Get it together or get out.

02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:31.088
Shame on you.

02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:34.426
Get it the fuck
together or get the fuck out.

02:01:34.428 --> 02:01:36.460
So you can... You can
make it work all on your own.

02:01:36.462 --> 02:01:38.663
You have some sort
of a hidden talent?

02:01:38.665 --> 02:01:41.499
- You need me.
- It's not hidden...

02:01:41.501 --> 02:01:43.601
- You need me.
- Yes!

02:01:43.603 --> 02:01:45.672
Yes, I need you, okay?

02:01:47.474 --> 02:01:51.209
I have never hidden that
or fought it.

02:01:51.211 --> 02:01:53.210
- But you need me too.
- No, I don't.

02:01:53.212 --> 02:01:56.614
- Yes! You do!
- No, I don't.

02:01:58.551 --> 02:02:01.785
Look at you. Now you're
going to cry about it.

02:02:01.787 --> 02:02:06.223
You're going to cry about
the life you don't have.

02:02:06.225 --> 02:02:08.763
I should have left you there.

02:02:10.596 --> 02:02:12.463
- You'd be dead without me.
- Shut up!

02:02:12.465 --> 02:02:14.731
- I should have left you in that bath tub.
- Shut up.

02:02:14.733 --> 02:02:16.567
- Shut up!
- Your father...

02:02:16.569 --> 02:02:18.168
- Shut up!
- Your father, he'd be crying...

02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:20.771
- Shut up! Shut up!
- ...but you wouldn't have to help me

02:02:20.773 --> 02:02:22.539
or wouldn't have to talk to me.

02:02:22.541 --> 02:02:23.641
I didn't ask you
for any of that.

02:02:23.643 --> 02:02:24.843
- Why didn't I leave you there?
- I didn't want that.

02:02:24.845 --> 02:02:27.212
- You're here because of me.
- I didn't ask you for that.

02:02:27.214 --> 02:02:29.146
- And I was in the hospital...
- I don't know why...

02:02:29.148 --> 02:02:31.583
- ...every single day.
- ...I'm here, but it's not for you.

02:02:31.585 --> 02:02:33.218
And don't fucking talk
about my dad.

02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:34.752
Thank you.
Thank you, okay,

02:02:34.754 --> 02:02:38.056
for protecting your meal ticket.
<i>Brava.</i>

02:02:38.058 --> 02:02:41.124
If you want to congratulate
yourself, go ahead.

02:02:41.126 --> 02:02:42.826
But I'm done.

02:02:42.828 --> 02:02:45.029
How can you say that?
Sit down.

02:02:45.031 --> 02:02:47.801
- Sit the fuck down.
- I'm not sitting down.

02:02:49.169 --> 02:02:50.837
Don't try it again.

02:02:51.670 --> 02:02:53.504
Don't try it again!

02:02:53.506 --> 02:02:55.707
- I'm finished!
- No.

02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:58.509
Listen to me.
Hey! Stop it!

02:02:58.511 --> 02:03:02.112
I have to go.

02:03:02.114 --> 02:03:05.652
Jesus!

02:03:06.586 --> 02:03:08.088
Get up.

02:03:49.328 --> 02:03:51.995
We can get through this.

02:03:51.997 --> 02:03:56.970
We can get through this because
we... We care about each other.

02:03:59.171 --> 02:04:01.606
Say it.
Say it with me.

02:04:01.608 --> 02:04:04.875
We care
about each other.

02:04:04.877 --> 02:04:09.012
I... I wanna help...
I wanna help you

02:04:09.014 --> 02:04:13.953
and so all you have to do is...
Show me how to do that.

02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:18.125
I... I can't lose you.

02:04:19.125 --> 02:04:21.825
I need you too.

02:04:21.827 --> 02:04:24.797
