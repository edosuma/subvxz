WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.674
<i>Precedently on</i> Fargo...

00:03.760 --> 00:07.356
Lester,
is this what you want?

00:08.680 --> 00:09.670
Yes.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.159
See you later, Lester.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.799
Okay. Get dressed.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.599
Lester, are you okay?

00:19.440 --> 00:20.476
Oh!

00:20.560 --> 00:22.517
Vegas PD is gonna
send over some pictures

00:22.600 --> 00:24.478
from the hotel
security camera.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.631
So don't leave town
for a while.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.234
I may have some
more questions.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.470
Ready to go?

00:29.560 --> 00:30.994
What? I thought
we weren't gonna go.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.433
Acapulco, here we come.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.273
Do you think
you could run in?

00:34.360 --> 00:35.396
The passports
are in the safe.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.914
There's some cash
in there too.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.593
It's cold out there.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.316
You're sweet.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.153
Is this what you want?

04:33.720 --> 04:34.915
Anywhere you like.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.679
Thanks.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.160
Just you?
Uh, no.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.074
There's, uh...
It'll be two of us.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.671
Linda's just...
Grabbing something
over by the shop.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.117
She dropped me off, said,
"Order the grilled cheese."

04:49.200 --> 04:51.556
So I guess
two of those.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.790
And to drink?

04:52.880 --> 04:55.270
A beer'd change things
for the better.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.837
Yeah, family place,
I'm afraid.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.311
Oh, okay...
Two ginger ales then.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.995
And I'll...
I'm gonna
use the bathroom.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.400
Free with the meal.
Right.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.393
That's the...
Hey, how you doing?

05:08.480 --> 05:09.630
Oh, hi.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.710
How are you?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.550
Boy,
he sure looks different.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.710
Yeah.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.393
He's a successful guy.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.720
Good for him.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.150
<i>Bemidji Police.</i>

05:39.760 --> 05:42.195
Yeah, I... I'd like
to report shots fired.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.757
<i>Sir, this is a non-emergency number.
You should've dialed 911.</i>

05:45.840 --> 05:47.797
Over on Elk and Third.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.037
Gunshots. Real loud.
<i>Oh.</i>

05:50.160 --> 05:53.278
Like about...
10 seconds ago.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.750
Sounded like they'd come
from inside one of the shops.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.274
<i>Okay. Sir?</i>

06:14.640 --> 06:15.915
Grilled cheese
coming right up.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.118
That's great, thanks.
Linda's just...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.476
She dropped me off,
grabbed something
over at the shop.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.239
Said she had to
pick something up.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.431
Yeah, you said that.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.398
Want me to keep hers warm
till she gets here?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.790
Oh, yeah.
That's... Although...

06:29.920 --> 06:31.752
Like I said,
she should be
any second now.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.311
You know... There was
a fella in here earlier,
asking about you.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.556
About me?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.030
Yeah, uh...
Silver-hair,
little goatee.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.470
Said he went
by your old house,
but you moved.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.950
Yeah,
we got the
house up on...

06:49.040 --> 06:50.554
What did he...
What did you tell him?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.831
Said if he wanted
to leave a number,
I'd give it to you.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.034
He couldn't see
his way clear to it,
so we left it at that.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.111
Can't say I much
liked his demeanor.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.556
Well...
Sorry for the bother.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.710
No bother.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.033
Thought you ought to know.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.159
<i>We're going
to Acapulco.</i>

07:25.400 --> 07:26.550
Oh, my God.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.280
Nothing good's
gonna come outta that.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.714
Right.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.274
<i>I don't.
You want a million
dollars in your case.</i>

07:46.400 --> 07:48.392
<i>I want a million.
It's all right.
Four more cases.</i>

07:48.480 --> 07:50.472
<i>- Three.
- Three.</i>

07:50.560 --> 07:52.392
Take the money, right?

07:52.520 --> 07:53.795
Forget that.
I say go for it.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.155
I'll get it.
I got it.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.240
Solverson.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.550
Wait. What?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.759
The other one now?

08:17.520 --> 08:18.840
Jeez.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.956
Where's Lester?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.917
Okay, put out an APB.
I'm getting my coat.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.910
What's that now?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.032
Someone killed
the second
Mrs. Nygaard.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.237
Hey, you didn't
have to come.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.913
Now we both know
that's not true.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.794
Okay.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.510
Poor thing.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.911
A head shot, I think.
I didn't look too close.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.320
Yeah.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.440
She's wearing his coat.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.636
Meaning?

09:30.320 --> 09:33.552
Meaning maybe it's not
Linda who's supposed
to be lying here.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.233
Let me through!

09:35.320 --> 09:36.879
Oh, Lester.
Mr. Nygaard.

09:37.000 --> 09:37.990
Oh, jeez!

09:38.120 --> 09:40.077
Yeah, go over here.
Yeah, let's get him
to sit down.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.311
Oh! Jeez! What?
Come on.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.359
That's right. Sit down.
Okay.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.834
Sit down.
Here we go. Sit.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.600
This is not happening.
This is not possible.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.878
Mr. Nygaard,
I have to ask you
where you're coming from.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.320
I just...

09:55.400 --> 09:57.676
I was over waiting
at the restaurant,
drinking ginger ale.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.474
Your dad was keeping
her grilled cheese warm,

10:00.560 --> 10:02.438
and I'm just waiting there.
I can't understand.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.751
She said she had to
pick some papers up.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.357
This is... Not possible.
This is impossible.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.199
Lester,
is there any way that...

10:12.480 --> 10:14.995
Do you think
that this is connected
to Las Vegas?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.834
The murders
we talked
about earlier?

10:17.920 --> 10:20.151
What are you saying?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.709
A repercussion
for what you saw,
maybe?

10:23.800 --> 10:24.790
Uh...

10:24.880 --> 10:28.669
She's wearing
your coat, the wife.
Molly saw that, so...

10:28.760 --> 10:31.400
What do you mean
she's wearing my coat?
What does that mean?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.590
Well, she...

10:32.680 --> 10:34.717
Her coat got a rip.
So I...

10:35.680 --> 10:39.037
Oh, wait.
Uh, you think...

10:43.520 --> 10:45.193
You're say...

10:47.640 --> 10:50.314
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.312
No, Lester.
If you throw up,
then I'm gonna.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.629
We gotta
get him outta here.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.554
Okay, Mr. Nygaard,
we're gonna take you
down to the station now.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.751
Yeah.
Ask you a lot of questions...

10:58.840 --> 11:01.150
Timeline, et cetera. Okay?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.913
Yeah,
whatever you
think is best.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.070
Thank you.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.397
Uh, wait, do you...

11:08.520 --> 11:11.752
Do you think...
Can I just...
Say goodbye?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.754
Well, this is
an active crime scene.
So...

11:14.840 --> 11:15.830
Of course you can,
Lester.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.912
You go ahead.
And take your time.

11:54.920 --> 11:55.910
Mr. Nygaard.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.039
Can't have you
touching the body, sir.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.956
I know...

12:02.120 --> 12:05.318
Of course not.
I'm sorry.
I'm just so...

12:05.400 --> 12:09.713
I understand.
Come on.
Come away now.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.712
Okay?
Yeah.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.474
That's right.
Okay. Yeah.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.430
Okay.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.515
<i>6-12 to base.
Chief says send the bus.</i>

12:32.600 --> 12:35.672
<i>Roger that, 6-12.
I'll let them know.</i>

12:37.600 --> 12:42.356
<i>Base to Emergency One.
Chief says send
the bus to 1381 Elk.</i>

12:55.080 --> 12:57.231
<i>6-13 to base. I'm inbound
with the husband.</i>

12:57.360 --> 12:59.113
<i>We'll need Interview One.</i>

13:01.560 --> 13:03.517
<i>Roger that, 6-13.</i>

13:06.080 --> 13:07.639
<i>6-13 to base.</i>

13:07.720 --> 13:09.279
<i>Yeah, go ahead, Molly.</i>

13:09.360 --> 13:11.829
<i>Also, someone should
wake those FBI boys.</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:15.834
<i>They're over at Leroy's.
Tell 'em we got developments.</i>

13:15.920 --> 13:17.718
<i>They should meet me
at the station.</i>

13:19.200 --> 13:21.874
<i>Roger that, 6-13.
We'll scoop 'em up.</i>

13:43.000 --> 13:44.195
We're awake, right?

13:44.280 --> 13:45.316
Who?

13:45.400 --> 13:46.436
Us.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.151
You're asking
if we're awake.
Me and you?

13:53.240 --> 13:54.720
Yeah, I was just...

13:54.800 --> 13:57.440
You know,
sometimes you're in
the middle of a dream...

13:57.520 --> 13:59.751
Do you say everything
that comes to your head?

14:03.440 --> 14:06.956
I got him in Interview One.
Also, they just
called from the scene.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.231
Looks like the wife
had plane tickets
in her pocket.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.277
Mexico.
Uh-oh.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.680
This could be a dream.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.318
What's he saying?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.717
Coroner's saying
a single shot
from close up.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.431
Said they found
feathers in her...
Head from her hood.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.000
They were stuck in...

14:26.120 --> 14:27.600
So... Execution style.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.920
I should have said
something earlier.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.957
You heard what happened?
More than heard.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.520
Saw the prowlers scream by.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.677
Lester was sitting
not 10 feet away,
eating a grilled cheese.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.952
Any chance you can put an
exact time on his arrival?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.713
Not down to
the minute, but...

14:43.800 --> 14:45.553
That's not why I'm...

14:46.680 --> 14:49.115
You remember you came by
with those FBI fellas earlier?

14:49.240 --> 14:50.594
And I was looking
out the glass?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.791
With a peculiar
look on your face?
Yeah.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.590
Well, there was a fella in
just before you got there...

14:56.680 --> 14:58.399
And he was
asking about Lester.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.476
What?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.120
Yeah,
I'm a fool for not saying...

15:03.200 --> 15:06.034
He was maybe mid-50s...
Upscale looking.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.555
Silver-hair,
brushed back...
With a goatee.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.915
Drove a red BMW.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.195
This fella?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.673
Not unless he changed
his whole...

15:18.920 --> 15:20.036
Although, maybe...

15:22.320 --> 15:23.436
Drove a red BMW,
you said?

15:23.520 --> 15:24.556
Yeah.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.911
Molly? Uh, we're going in.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.034
Dad, I gotta go.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.037
Well, there's two ways
of looking at it.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.354
The first is you gotta.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.354
The second is you don't.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.680
Will you...
Call home for me?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.034
Let Gus know that...

15:54.440 --> 15:56.591
Tell him it's gonna
be all night.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.557
Oh, screw that.
I'm getting my gun,
is what I'm doing.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.190
Go sit on the front porch...
Make sure
my granddaughter's safe.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.549
You're a good man.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.269
Lester,
is this what you want?

17:03.960 --> 17:06.349
<i>Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</i>

17:11.599 --> 17:12.875
Is she... Bill...

17:13.880 --> 17:15.519
Tell me she's not
still lying there

17:15.599 --> 17:17.478
and everyone's just
stepping over her.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.270
Mr. Nygaard,
these fellas
are from the FBI.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.511
The... The what?
Is this...

17:28.720 --> 17:30.598
Come on, I told you.
I didn't see nothing.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.797
All I did was
get on an elevator.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.473
We're not here
about Las Vegas, sir.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.960
Well, we are
and we aren't.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.077
Um, okay.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.634
We're here...

17:40.560 --> 17:41.550
About him.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.236
Based on
the hustle of the deputy,
we have a name for him.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.800
Lorne Malvo.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.000
Uh, Bill?

17:57.680 --> 17:59.319
Answer the question.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.593
Um, yeah,
I'm now asking for a lawyer.
This is for the record.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.153
He's changed his look,
hasn't he?

18:12.240 --> 18:13.993
I'm done answering your...

18:14.080 --> 18:16.117
You've obviously...

18:16.240 --> 18:18.436
Made up your mind
that I'm some kind of...

18:18.520 --> 18:20.193
And I'm... I'm not...

18:20.280 --> 18:22.511
My wife is dead!

18:24.120 --> 18:27.511
And... There are
arrangements to see to.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.196
So...
You can either lock me up
or let me go.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.510
He's not gonna stop.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.034
You know that, right?

18:40.360 --> 18:43.194
A man like that...

18:44.560 --> 18:46.392
May be not even a man.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.070
Hey there.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.919
What's going on?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.878
What do you mean?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.155
I mean, it's...

19:18.240 --> 19:20.072
7:00 in the morning
and you're sitting

19:20.160 --> 19:21.913
on my front porch
with a shotgun.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.310
There is some consensus
this Malvo fella may be back.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.270
Where's Molly?

19:32.280 --> 19:34.511
Left her at the precinct
last night.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.593
Had Lester Nygaard
in custody...
About to talk to him.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.319
I'm going after her.
Keep an eye on Greta.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.640
Believe me,
I mean to.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.193
Okay,
so the plan is,
we fan out.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.636
Prowlers on
all the main roads
looking for Malvo.

19:55.760 --> 20:00.039
Encircle the town,
in other words.
Uh, there's... Yeah?

20:00.120 --> 20:02.112
Well, there are
three main roads.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.591
So actually...
More of a triangle.

20:05.680 --> 20:06.670
Hmm.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.077
There's photos
of the suspect
in your packets.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.799
We hear he might have
changed his look though.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.715
So silver hair now,
brushed back,
possibly a goatee.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.872
Uh, drives a red BMW,
possibly stolen.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.155
The FBI is sending a team.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.993
And in the meantime,
the two original agents

20:22.080 --> 20:24.151
are staking
out Lester's house.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.833
Molly, Gus on one.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.397
Yeah,
I'll be out there with you
coordinating maneuvers. So...

20:29.480 --> 20:31.392
Pass those
out for me?
Thanks.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.518
Yeah, hon.
<i>Hey, I've been calling.</i>

20:37.640 --> 20:39.871
<i>Yeah, I know, sorry.
It's been...</i>

20:40.000 --> 20:41.957
Is it true?
Is he back?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.795
Yeah, I just finished
briefing the guys. So...

20:45.880 --> 20:47.997
We tried to crack Lester,
but he wouldn't flinch.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.037
So the plan is,
now we're gonna
use him as bait...

20:50.160 --> 20:51.196
<i>Molly.</i>

20:53.240 --> 20:55.072
Yeah, so things are
real busy here, hon.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.435
<i>Look, hon.</i>

20:56.520 --> 21:00.400
Don't, okay?
I gotta ask you not to...

21:00.520 --> 21:03.797
<i>Don't go out there.
You personally,
don't go looking for...</i>

21:03.880 --> 21:05.394
It's my job.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.116
Yeah, I know.
And you're amazing
and the best.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.876
And I have no doubt
that if you wanted,
you could handcuff Al Capone.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.239
<i>But some days, sometimes,
you get forces
you can't control.</i>

21:17.360 --> 21:18.953
<i>Bad luck, you know?</i>

21:19.040 --> 21:20.235
Bad luck.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.192
<i>Yeah, and this is all...</i>

21:22.280 --> 21:26.240
If it really is him,
Malvo, I just...

21:28.360 --> 21:30.431
With everything
we've been working for,
you know...

21:30.520 --> 21:32.239
<i>Our family and...</i>
Gus.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.990
<i>And I know
it's not fair.
It's not.</i>

21:36.080 --> 21:38.117
<i>It's your job,
and I'm just a mailman.</i>

21:38.200 --> 21:41.193
<i>But you've
got a precinct
full of cops.</i>

21:41.320 --> 21:43.312
And the FBI is there.
So I just...

21:45.240 --> 21:48.870
Bottom line,
I can't make her go
to another funeral, you know?

21:52.240 --> 21:53.879
Yeah.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.550
Okay, don't worry.
I'll just...

22:00.080 --> 22:01.958
Yeah, I'll run things
from here.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.800
<i>Okay. Good... Good.</i>

22:05.960 --> 22:07.872
<i>I'm in the car.
I'm coming over.</i>

22:07.960 --> 22:09.792
No, don't.
That's not...

22:10.800 --> 22:14.111
No, just go home.
Be with our girl.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.116
Hey, is my dad there?

22:17.240 --> 22:20.438
Yeah, yeah...
On the porch
with a shotgun.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.550
Gotta love a man
who keeps his word, right?

22:25.640 --> 22:26.630
<i>So you promise?</i>

22:27.760 --> 22:30.275
Yeah, I won't
leave the building

22:30.360 --> 22:32.317
until they call
and tell me he's surrounded.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.037
No... Until he's dead.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.839
<i>I'll call you in
a little bit, okay?</i>

26:05.840 --> 26:09.072
So it's decided.
FBI fellas are
gonna call for backup.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.913
We're gonna take Lester home,
sit on the house,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.037
see if we can't draw
this Malvo fella out.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.194
You okay, Chief?

26:19.720 --> 26:21.200
Hanging it up after this.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.716
What's that?

26:25.360 --> 26:28.273
I quit...
Is what I'm saying.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.511
Don't got
the stomach for it.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.590
Not like some.

26:34.680 --> 26:39.471
Wearing the badge,
seeing the lengths
people are capable of.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.914
The inhumanity.

26:44.280 --> 26:47.352
Whatever happened to...
Saying good morning
to your neighbors?

26:47.440 --> 26:52.674
And shoveling
their walk and bringing
in each other's toters?

26:52.760 --> 26:55.912
Well... Still goes on.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.198
Yeah, but...
Not the same.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.872
I used to have
positive opinions

27:03.960 --> 27:06.395
about the world,
you know, about people.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.791
Used to think the best.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.998
Now I'm...
Looking over
my shoulder.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.039
"An unquiet mind."
That's what
the wife calls it.

27:17.720 --> 27:22.749
The job has got me
staring into the fireplace...
Drinking.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.755
I never wanted
to be the type to think

27:26.840 --> 27:30.277
big thoughts about
the nature of things and...

27:32.240 --> 27:36.234
All I ever wanted was...
A stack of pancakes
and a V-8.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.559
So I'm recommending
that you take over as Chief.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.232
I...
I appreciate that, but I...
No, no.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.873
You're the real deal.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.270
You got the instincts
and the disposition.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.631
I didn't see it before,
but now...

27:56.600 --> 27:59.399
And Vern saw it.
I know that.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.200
So I'm hoping that
after you have the baby,

28:02.280 --> 28:05.796
you'll come back here and...
Take things over.

28:07.760 --> 28:11.640
Well, I...
I will think about that.
I will.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.753
I gotta talk to Gus, so...

28:22.160 --> 28:24.436
So, uh... You're okay
with the plan then?

28:26.440 --> 28:28.716
Call in the cavalry
and set a trap.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.758
Yeah...
We're a small-time force.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.595
We're not equipped for,
you know... Urban warfare.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.320
Most of these guys
can't shoot
a can off a fence.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.790
Okay.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.554
Chin up, Chief.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.512
Police?
<i>Uh, yes,</i>

29:14.600 --> 29:17.115
this is FBI main.
I'm looking for my agents.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.236
<i>Yeah...</i>

29:18.360 --> 29:21.512
They're with a suspect.
I could interrupt.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.080
You want Pepper or Budge?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.240
Uh, negatory.
Don't interrupt.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.353
Just tell them to call home
when they're done.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.074
<i>FBI?</i>

29:46.200 --> 29:47.270
Operations.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.635
<i>Passcode?</i>

29:48.720 --> 29:50.234
Uh, six-one-alpha-theta-nine.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.396
<i>Transferring.</i>

29:53.120 --> 29:54.554
<i>Operations.</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:57.439
Uh, yes,
this is Agent Budge.

29:57.560 --> 30:00.394
We've hit a dead end out here.
So we're gonna
be heading back.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.596
<i>Say again?</i>

30:01.680 --> 30:03.080
Dead end, heading back.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.637
<i>Hold on.
Didn't you just call
looking for backup?</i>

30:06.720 --> 30:09.155
Yeah, my partner,
he kind of jumped
the gun on that one.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.232
But looks like
local PD has it
under control.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.834
So we're gonna
just pack and blow.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.276
<i>Whatever.
Get your shit straight.</i>

30:15.400 --> 30:17.153
<i>Cancelling backup.</i>

30:47.600 --> 30:49.432
Help you, sir?

30:49.520 --> 30:52.160
I hope so.
I got my eye on this one.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.272
Oh, she's a beaut,
that's for sure.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.831
V-8 engine...
Only 22,000 miles on her.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.320
I like it 'cause
it looks like
an undercover vehicle.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.671
Like an FBI car.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.956
Well, sir,
I guess she does.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.435
Never thought about it.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.996
Even got the long
antenna on the back.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.473
Mind if we take
a test drive?

31:16.680 --> 31:19.957
Well... Well,
we're not officially
open yet.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.474
But I don't see why not.
Hold on, I'll grab the keys.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.678
Shotgun.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.754
Okay... So we're
letting you go.

32:03.920 --> 32:04.990
About time.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.038
Yeah, and so the FBI fellas,
they're gonna drive you home.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.592
Not necessary.
I can call a cab.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.309
Yeah.
Well, like I said,
we're letting you go,

32:16.400 --> 32:19.359
but at the same time
a wanted fugitive has
been spotted in town.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.353
And we think he's got
intentions towards you.
So...

32:23.360 --> 32:26.000
The ride home's
not really optional.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.720
Well, they're not
coming in the house.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.599
Sure. Okay.
We can play it that way.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.791
But they're still
gonna stick around
for a while,

32:33.880 --> 32:36.190
keep an eye on things.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.480
You know...
I'm not sure

32:45.560 --> 32:48.917
what it is that
you've had against me
since day one, but, um...

32:50.200 --> 32:56.037
I am not the person
you think I am, this...
This kind of monster.

33:00.080 --> 33:04.677
There was a fellow once...
Running for a train.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.116
And he's carrying
a pair of gloves,
this man.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.120
He drops a glove
on the platform...
But he doesn't notice.

33:11.840 --> 33:15.993
And then later on...
Uh, inside the train,
he's sitting by the window,

33:16.080 --> 33:20.552
and he realizes
that he's just got
this one glove left.

33:20.640 --> 33:24.077
But the train's
already started pulling
out of the station, right?

33:26.280 --> 33:28.590
So what does he do?

33:28.720 --> 33:30.074
He opens the window...

33:32.080 --> 33:35.710
And he drops
the other glove
onto the platform.

33:35.800 --> 33:40.272
That way...
Whoever finds
the first glove...

33:40.400 --> 33:41.720
Can just have the pair.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.636
So... What are you
telling me?

33:50.440 --> 33:51.840
Goodbye, Mr. Nygaard.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.594
Goodbye, Deputy.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.680
I didn't do this,
you know...

35:07.520 --> 35:09.159
Any of it.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.230
That deputy... Boy...
She's got a thing for me.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.352
So, Lester,
say you had a boat.
No.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.630
Say you've got a boat

35:26.720 --> 35:30.350
and you've got a fox,
a rabbit and a cabbage.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.957
Now, you can only
row one of them across
the river at a time.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.394
Now, you could
take the cabbage,

35:35.480 --> 35:37.790
but then the fox
would eat the rabbit.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.918
Or you can take the fox,
but the rabbit
would eat the cabbage.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.759
What are you asking?
Same thing on the other side.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.917
You could leave
the rabbit there alone,

35:45.080 --> 35:48.869
but... What happens when
you bring the fox over

35:49.040 --> 35:50.394
and go back
for the cabbage?

35:50.520 --> 35:51.556
Forget it.

35:51.680 --> 35:55.754
My partner doesn't know
what he's talking about.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.116
I already told you,
just eat all three of them.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.596
Can I only
row them across
in one direction?

36:00.760 --> 36:01.910
No, no. Either way.

36:05.080 --> 36:09.518
Well then...
You row
the rabbit across,

36:09.600 --> 36:13.196
and the fox won't
eat the cabbage.

36:13.280 --> 36:18.514
Then you go
back for the fox...
And when you drop him off,

36:18.600 --> 36:21.240
you put
the rabbit back in the boat
and go get the cabbage.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.916
Only this time,
you leave the rabbit behind

36:25.040 --> 36:27.999
and then you row
the cabbage back across.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.635
Again, the fox will
not eat the cabbage

36:30.720 --> 36:34.953
and then you...
Go back for the rabbit.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.956
That's it.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.560
See? That wasn't so hard.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.353
We feel we need
to say again

37:21.440 --> 37:23.033
that your life
may be in danger.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.799
Like a lot of danger.

37:24.880 --> 37:29.352
So we're gonna sit
right here for a bit.
Keep an eye on things.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.472
Free country, isn't it?

38:40.880 --> 38:42.109
Thanks.
Yeah.

38:48.240 --> 38:51.312
You were police once...
Molly says.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.390
State cop...

38:52.520 --> 38:53.920
18 years.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.592
Took a bullet in the hip
on a traffic stop...

38:58.320 --> 38:59.674
Retired full pension.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.118
You ever do this before...
Stand guard?

39:07.120 --> 39:10.079
One other time...
Winter of 1979...

39:11.440 --> 39:12.715
Minus 4 degrees.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.597
Sat on a dark porch
from dusk till dawn.

39:18.280 --> 39:21.000
Your stepmom was
inside sleeping...

39:21.120 --> 39:22.270
Four years old.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.113
Who did you
think was coming?

39:27.480 --> 39:31.679
Wasn't a question of "who,"
more like "what."

39:32.920 --> 39:33.990
Did it come?

39:36.960 --> 39:40.237
Not that night...
But soon after.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.637
What are you
planning to do
with that?

40:10.520 --> 40:13.957
If he comes...
I'll put his eye out.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.157
You can finish him off.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.319
That's my girl.

40:25.280 --> 40:29.513
<i>Yeah, so car 18,
checking in...
Over on Bear Patch.</i>

40:29.640 --> 40:30.960
<i>Pretty quiet, huh?</i>

40:32.480 --> 40:34.358
Okay, 18, keep
your eyes peeled.
Over.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.237
Hey, car 6,
anything?

40:41.360 --> 40:44.239
<i>Hey, this is car 6
out on 71.</i>

40:44.320 --> 40:46.232
<i>I had a pickup
with an unsecured load.</i>

40:47.200 --> 40:49.078
<i>All quiet otherwise.</i>

40:50.880 --> 40:52.234
Yeah, roger that, 6.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.240
Keep me posted, okay?

41:11.880 --> 41:14.190
I'm gonna run
over to Lester's.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.158
Uh, but give a shout
when the other FBI rolls up.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.515
You think it's safe?

41:19.880 --> 41:22.236
For me, I'm saying...

41:22.360 --> 41:26.115
Here...
With that fella out there.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.550
I mean,
everyone else is gone.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.673
Yeah, maybe lock the door.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.591
You still think
this is a dream?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.598
What?
This.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.513
Today?
No.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.717
What if my whole
life has been a dream?

42:06.560 --> 42:08.119
Yeah, but whose
dream is it?

42:13.600 --> 42:14.590
Heads up.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.076
What do you think?

42:32.200 --> 42:33.429
Could be our backup.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.312
FBI, step out of the car!

42:52.480 --> 42:54.073
Out of the car! Now!

43:10.200 --> 43:11.714
Let me see your hands!

43:21.000 --> 43:22.480
His hands are taped.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.510
I'm sorry.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.556
This is a dream.

43:31.000 --> 43:31.990
Ah!

43:49.080 --> 43:50.230
Please...

43:51.560 --> 43:52.914
I got a little girl.

44:18.440 --> 44:19.430
Gosh.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.274
What?

45:25.800 --> 45:28.918
Police?
Yeah, I need
the police please.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.479
Yes, it's an emergency.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.318
This is Lester Nygaard,
you gotta...

45:38.440 --> 45:40.591
I think the...

45:40.680 --> 45:42.637
You need to send somebody.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.470
I need help now.
I need you to come.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.115
Please!

45:52.040 --> 45:54.680
My...
Lester Nygaard.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.672
Please...
Just hurry up!

46:00.360 --> 46:03.637
I'm upstairs in the bathroom.
There's no lock on the door.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.191
Oh, God!
You've gotta hurry.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.679
Ow! Ow!

46:21.400 --> 46:22.550
Oh, shit!

49:58.920 --> 50:00.036
God damn it.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.840
I figured it out.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.033
Good for you.

51:54.080 --> 51:57.278
Your riddle...
Shades of green...
I figured it out.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.030
And?

55:08.240 --> 55:09.230
Open it.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.236
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

55:50.320 --> 55:52.516
<i>Yeah, it's... It's...
It's me. It's Lester.</i>

55:53.120 --> 55:56.113
<i>Uh, she's...
My wife...
My wife, she's...</i>

55:56.200 --> 55:57.919
<i>Oh, hell!</i>

55:59.000 --> 56:00.400
<i>Look, I think I...</i>

56:01.640 --> 56:03.791
<i>She's in
the basement dead and...</i>

56:03.920 --> 56:06.480
<i>Look, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.</i>

56:08.240 --> 56:10.471
<i>Lester,
have you been
a bad boy?</i>

56:10.560 --> 56:13.871
<i>Uh! Jeez.</i>

56:15.080 --> 56:17.754
<i>Yeah, I took
the hammer and...</i>

56:17.840 --> 56:22.198
<i>Look, can you come over?
I'm on Willow Creek Drive,
number 613.</i>

56:24.040 --> 56:25.759
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

56:58.160 --> 56:59.753
I think that's him.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.759
Oh, no.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.229
Get after him!
Come on!

57:56.640 --> 58:00.680
Stop! It's not safe!

58:03.240 --> 58:06.392
Hey, come back!
It's too dangerous!

58:10.120 --> 58:11.110
Stop!

59:13.040 --> 59:14.110
Solverson.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.310
Are you sure?

59:24.160 --> 59:27.995
Okay, well...
Let me know what
the divers turn up.

59:48.480 --> 59:50.312
Take the money, right?

59:50.480 --> 59:52.312
No, I say go for it.

59:52.480 --> 59:53.675
What'd I miss?

59:53.800 --> 59:57.680
The lady brought a list...
And Dad's being a wuss again.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.280
No, stop it!

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.272
Scooch over, you.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.510
Hey, so I...
I got a call today.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.798
They're gonna give me
a citation for bravery.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.280
You?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.477
Come on,
you're afraid
of spiders.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.360
Buzz Aldrin was
afraid of spiders
and he went into space.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.673
Proud of you, hon.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.558
They really should
be giving it to you.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.230
No.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.674
No, this is your deal.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.000
I get to be Chief.
