00:01.112 --> 00:03.152
In the criminal justice system

00:03.224 --> 00:04.785
sexually based offenses

00:04.857 --> 00:06.417
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.489 --> 00:08.660
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.728 --> 00:10.355
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.425 --> 00:12.149
are members of an elite squad

00:12.216 --> 00:13.972
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.928
These are their stories.

00:17.241 --> 00:21.267
It's an above-ground Jacuzzi. I don't
know why you're digging that deep.

00:21.338 --> 00:22.898
It's called a foundation,
Mr. Sawyer.

00:22.969 --> 00:25.336
Just make sure you don't
hit a gas main or something.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.710
We know what we're doing.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.784
Then you know you have to
take out all those weeds.

00:28.858 --> 00:30.679
The roots will break
right through the concrete.

00:30.746 --> 00:32.468
Last owner left
this place a mess.

00:32.537 --> 00:35.571
Don't worry. We'll clear the
whole yard. No extra charge.

00:36.505 --> 00:37.848
Aren't those
hydrangea bushes?

00:37.914 --> 00:39.985
Why'd you think I said we'd
clear the yard for nothing?

00:40.057 --> 00:42.196
We're gonna make more off
those bushes than off this job.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.542
I know a guy
in Hackensack...

00:43.609 --> 00:44.853
What?

00:47.258 --> 00:50.967
We closed on the house a month ago.
Had it inspected, inside and out...

00:51.033 --> 00:52.560
For termites,
not dead bodies.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.870
We're suing that realtor.
You're all witnesses...

00:54.938 --> 00:57.655
Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer, we're gonna
need you to leave the crime scene.

00:57.722 --> 00:59.827
It's our new home. We'll
try not to take too long.

00:59.898 --> 01:01.905
It's all right.
Just let them...

01:02.233 --> 01:03.280
Hi.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.752
Detectives.
What've we got?

01:05.817 --> 01:09.134
Judging from the eye orbits, nasal
opening, and cheek bone projection...

01:09.209 --> 01:10.704
I'd say a Caucasian.

01:10.777 --> 01:12.981
Surface of the auricular
region puts her under 30.

01:13.050 --> 01:14.871
Her?
Did you find any clothes?

01:14.937 --> 01:17.687
A few scraps.
Most of the fabric decomposed.

01:17.754 --> 01:19.509
But look at the hips.

01:19.578 --> 01:23.636
Wide sciatic notch, long
pubic bone. Definitely female.

01:23.706 --> 01:24.818
Cause of death?

01:24.889 --> 01:26.678
No obvious knife marks
or bullet holes.

01:26.746 --> 01:28.983
Hopefully I'll know more
after I put her back together.

01:29.050 --> 01:32.148
Now, how are we getting sexual
homicide from a bunch of bones?

01:32.218 --> 01:33.811
Check the evidence tray.

01:36.794 --> 01:38.320
It's a crucifix.

01:38.395 --> 01:41.526
I think he means
the studded collar and leash.

01:42.298 --> 01:44.817
Looks like our bone lady
was somebody's pet.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:33.467 --> 02:36.052
The previous owners
put in the hydrangeas.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.970
And they were?
The Stantons. Brad and Abbey.

02:39.035 --> 02:42.351
Fought constantly from the day they
moved in, to the day Abbey moved out.

02:42.426 --> 02:45.143
And when was that?
About four years ago.

02:45.210 --> 02:48.472
Anything violent? Loud,
yes. Violent, I never saw.

02:50.234 --> 02:53.431
Did Abbey ever come back? Yeah,
but not for a good year or so.

02:53.498 --> 02:57.589
She'd pound on his door, wailing.
He'd come out, slip her a few bucks.

02:57.658 --> 03:01.205
This became like a weekly ritual.
Usually about 3:00 in the morning.

03:01.274 --> 03:03.859
How long did that go on?
About a month or two.

03:03.930 --> 03:06.036
One night
he doesn't answer his door.

03:06.107 --> 03:08.790
She starts screaming she's gonna
report him to the medical board...

03:08.858 --> 03:10.266
for having sex
with his patients.

03:10.330 --> 03:11.890
So he's a doctor?
A surgeon.

03:11.963 --> 03:16.370
Anyhow, the door bursts open,
Abbey gets the crap beat out of her.

03:17.019 --> 03:18.808
You said you never saw
any violence.

03:18.874 --> 03:23.480
No. I never saw Brad hit her. This was
Pam, the new wife, throwing the punches.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.585
Guess he likes
his women feisty.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.894
When was the next time
you saw Abbey?

03:29.979 --> 03:31.157
Never.

03:32.251 --> 03:34.105
Captain, check it out.

03:34.907 --> 03:37.177
How sick is this? A crucifix.

03:37.244 --> 03:39.513
Get this,
dog collar and leash.

03:39.835 --> 03:42.038
Looks like
an S&M session gone south.

03:42.107 --> 03:43.700
The lab get
any prints off them?

03:43.771 --> 03:45.080
Not yet.

03:45.147 --> 03:46.871
Any idea
how long she was buried?

03:46.940 --> 03:48.728
ME's best guesstimate
is three years.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.650
What about... We're all
over missing persons.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.504
Okay, so who had access
to this yard?

03:52.571 --> 03:54.775
The previous owners,
the Stantons.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.403
The story reads like
a bad soap opera.

03:56.475 --> 03:57.882
Doctor marries
wife number two...

03:57.947 --> 03:59.639
wife number one
mysteriously disappears.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.741
After wife number two uses wife
number one as a punching bag.

04:02.812 --> 04:04.754
Well, go have a talk
with the happy couple.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.756
You two check and see if anybody else
remembers the first Mrs. Dr. Stanton.

04:09.243 --> 04:11.218
Million-dollar view
of the murder scene.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.047
Any of your apartments
overlook the yard?

04:13.116 --> 04:16.182
We have six buildings on this
block. We're talking 36 units.

04:16.252 --> 04:19.732
Any of your tenants come up
missing between late '97, early '99?

04:19.803 --> 04:23.698
Yeah. They go missing when they forget
to pay their rent for three months.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.622
Meanwhile, that's lost income.

04:25.691 --> 04:27.830
We're gonna need a list
from the aforementioned years.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.063
And rental applications.
Oh, yeah, applications.

04:32.252 --> 04:34.740
We have a very stringent
screening process...

04:34.812 --> 04:37.943
what with all the high-class
people desperate to move in here.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.281
Can we take a look
at your files?

04:40.348 --> 04:42.104
Knock yourselves out.

04:48.028 --> 04:50.963
Brad was married to that
blood-sucking leech for five years.

04:51.036 --> 04:52.945
Why did you attack her?

04:53.788 --> 04:56.788
Abbey accused Brad
of sleeping with his patients.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.650
She's a bottom-feeding,
mainlining junkie.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.050
A constant source of
embarrassment for my husband.

05:01.117 --> 05:03.604
And how embarrassed were you?
I was angry.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.515
She was my friend once. We
went to nursing school together.

05:06.589 --> 05:10.101
When did they divorce? In '97.
Brad was extremely generous.

05:10.173 --> 05:11.995
You mean above and beyond
the settlement?

05:12.060 --> 05:13.620
Until I put my foot down.

05:13.692 --> 05:16.081
It was about three years ago,
he finally cut her off.

05:16.156 --> 05:18.012
Have you heard from her since?

05:18.204 --> 05:19.699
No, thank God.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.938
Why? What kind of trouble
is Abbey in now?

05:23.004 --> 05:24.728
A woman's remains
were found buried...

05:24.796 --> 05:27.513
under the hydrangea
behind your former brownstone.

05:28.701 --> 05:30.108
Oh, my God.

05:30.173 --> 05:32.726
They've been there
about three years.

05:37.213 --> 05:40.693
Where's your husband now?
The hospital. Extremely busy.

05:41.373 --> 05:45.978
Look, Brad couldn't kill anybody,
not even that horrible bitch.

05:48.861 --> 05:50.323
I have to go to work.

05:52.382 --> 05:55.993
I didn't kill Abbey. She was busy
killing herself with her habit.

05:56.061 --> 05:59.226
But you married her anyway?
I loved her.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.203
Back then, she was only
on Xanax for anxiety...

06:02.269 --> 06:04.658
and then she started stealing
Demerol and Dilaudid...

06:04.733 --> 06:06.261
and the hospital
finally had to fire her.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.024
That must have been
humiliating for you...

06:08.093 --> 06:09.883
especially the yelling
and the extortion.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.730
I had to sit there and watch,
powerless, while she hit rock bottom.

06:12.797 --> 06:15.284
Bottom being three feet
under your former hydrangeas.

06:15.357 --> 06:16.601
It's not Abbey.

06:17.693 --> 06:20.027
Look, I got a case in half
an hour. I got to scrub.

06:20.092 --> 06:22.646
Without saying hello to your
wife? Leave her out of this.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.277
I told you he was busy.

06:24.349 --> 06:27.032
I can handle this. I'll
see you inside. Okay.

06:27.101 --> 06:29.075
Stop wasting our time.

06:33.469 --> 06:35.379
That's what
you're looking for.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.874
Please, whatever you do,
don't tell Pam.

06:44.221 --> 06:46.643
She's not gonna
be able to tell you much.

06:49.949 --> 06:52.666
This is Abbey?
AIDS-related dementia.

06:52.989 --> 06:55.859
Dr. Stanton pays the bills,
keeps the roses fresh.

06:55.933 --> 06:57.394
When was the last time
he was here?

06:57.469 --> 06:58.679
When he brought her in.

06:58.749 --> 07:00.603
She hasn't had
a visitor since.

07:00.669 --> 07:03.255
It's sad. She doesn't have
much time left.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.858
Thank you.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.763
Now what?
Back to the bones.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.244
Figure out how she died yet?
Strangulation.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.483
Pressure fractures
to the hyoid.

07:15.549 --> 07:19.127
Fits the S&M theory. Auto-erotic
asphyxiation, but he mistimes it.

07:19.198 --> 07:20.660
Don't know how
he could have.

07:20.734 --> 07:23.636
There's a peri-mortem break in one
of the metacarpals of her right hand.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.075
So she put up a struggle. Now
we're back to the sexual sadist.

07:26.142 --> 07:28.247
What else have we got?
Well, she was petite.

07:28.318 --> 07:29.300
I measured her femur.

07:29.374 --> 07:32.537
Estimate she was 5'4. And I
think she was Eastern European.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.350
You got that from the bones?
From her teeth.

07:36.126 --> 07:37.555
I found traces of arsenic.

07:37.630 --> 07:40.412
Using arsenic to kill a nerve is
an old Russian dental practice...

07:40.478 --> 07:41.972
that spread to
most of the Eastern Bloc.

07:42.046 --> 07:45.243
Great. So her dental records are
somewhere in the former Soviet Union.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.506
Maybe this will help. Henry
is our forensic anthropologist.

07:48.574 --> 07:49.948
Show them
what you came up with.

07:50.014 --> 07:53.014
I entered the dimensions of the
skull, put in tissue depth markers.

07:53.086 --> 07:54.679
That's determined by age,
right?

07:54.751 --> 07:55.995
We figure she's around 30...

07:56.062 --> 07:58.712
so she'd have more facial
tissue than, say, a 50-year-old.

07:58.782 --> 07:59.829
Then what?

07:59.903 --> 08:04.409
I fashioned the nose, ears, and mouth
accordingly, and layer by layer got this.

08:06.238 --> 08:09.816
How close do you think it is?
It's a reasonable approximation.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.851
Print her out.

08:13.343 --> 08:15.677
So she's from behind
the fallen Iron Curtain.

08:15.742 --> 08:19.289
That narrows it down to a couple hundred
thousand of your poor huddled masses.

08:19.358 --> 08:21.301
What's all that?
Meticulously kept records...

08:21.374 --> 08:23.742
from the tenement complex
behind our burial ground.

08:23.807 --> 08:26.873
The manager's been somewhat remiss
in keeping track of her tenants.

08:26.943 --> 08:29.211
I guess we can rule out
Ming Noh Ling.

08:29.279 --> 08:31.319
Any names in there
that sound Eastern Bloc?

08:31.391 --> 08:34.238
Sixteen and counting.
Track them down.

08:35.903 --> 08:38.586
No, I don't speak Romanian.
You speak English?

08:38.655 --> 08:40.248
Yes, I understand. Latvia.

08:40.318 --> 08:42.490
Is there anyone else there
who knows what happened to her?

08:42.558 --> 08:45.112
You're saying that she went back
to Latvia two years ago, right?

08:45.183 --> 08:47.704
I'm calling from the police
department, not Immigration.

08:47.775 --> 08:51.037
Sir, we have nothing to do with
deportation. Okay, yes, thank you.

08:51.103 --> 08:52.248
Hello?

08:53.567 --> 08:54.614
Find anything?

08:54.687 --> 08:56.378
Yeah. Eastern Europeans
don't trust cops.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.008
I have two
that are unaccounted for.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.966
I have three.
How are you guys doing?

09:00.032 --> 09:02.998
Yearning to be free of this.
Five people I can't place.

09:03.072 --> 09:04.118
One.

09:04.192 --> 09:07.192
Okay. Let's just get them over
to missing persons, okay?

09:08.127 --> 09:09.208
No match.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.417
How many more of these?
Three boxes.

09:11.487 --> 09:14.040
You know how many women go
missing in this city every year?

09:14.110 --> 09:15.191
Hey.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.110
You find something?
I don't know. You tell me.

09:18.303 --> 09:20.059
Pretty damn close.

09:20.352 --> 09:24.279
"Ava Parulis." That's P-A-R.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.644
Reported missing:
April of '98.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.342
Here we go.

09:29.952 --> 09:34.262
Ava Parulis rented an apartment
behind the crime scene in February '98.

09:34.656 --> 09:37.722
Gone by that April. Skipped
out on the last month's rent.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.286
How far did you guys
get with her?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.821
From what it says here,
not too far.

09:40.895 --> 09:43.797
The detective who worked the
case retired to Arizona last year.

09:43.871 --> 09:45.497
And who reported her missing?

09:45.568 --> 09:50.303
Let me see. Guy in Queens, George
Burton. The address is in Rego Park.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.375
Hi. What's your name? I'm not
supposed to talk to strangers.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.579
You're right. What if I tell
you we're police officers?

09:59.647 --> 10:01.306
Do you have badges?

10:01.377 --> 10:04.791
Right answer again. My name is
Elliot. This is my friend, Olivia.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.509
Can I help you?
They're policemen, Daddy.

10:10.624 --> 10:12.730
Go inside, Julia,
it's getting cold.

10:13.952 --> 10:14.999
Bye.

10:15.073 --> 10:18.750
Sorry to bother you. I'm Det. Stabler,
this is my partner, Det. Benson.

10:18.816 --> 10:20.190
Something's wrong?

10:20.254 --> 10:22.011
You reported
your sister-in-law...

10:22.079 --> 10:23.902
Ava Parulis, missing.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.807
You found Ava?
We may have.

10:30.432 --> 10:33.748
I gave this picture to the
police. What happened to Ava?

10:34.399 --> 10:37.433
The police are here?
Is everything all right?

10:46.049 --> 10:50.782
My twin sister, Ava, and I came
here five years ago from Romania.

10:54.623 --> 10:59.131
She was always bossing me around.
She was older by six minutes.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.063
Do you have any idea who
could have killed your sister?

11:05.761 --> 11:06.807
No.

11:07.329 --> 11:09.369
I have twins.
They're inseparable.

11:10.113 --> 11:11.935
You two
must have been close.

11:12.863 --> 11:16.061
Ava was wild. The two of them
couldn't have been more different.

11:16.128 --> 11:18.169
Ava played
by her own rules.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.211
She went from one rich man
to the next.

11:22.529 --> 11:25.211
Until she finally met
the wrong one.

11:25.696 --> 11:26.874
Irina.

11:27.425 --> 11:28.734
I'm sorry.

11:31.841 --> 11:33.183
Please forgive my wife.

11:33.249 --> 11:36.414
Mr. Burton, we know how
difficult this must be for you.

11:37.889 --> 11:42.526
Irina and Ava lived through
hell. Orphanages, abuse.

11:42.945 --> 11:46.175
When they came to this country,
all they had was each other.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.895
What happened?
They had a falling-out.

11:48.962 --> 11:50.237
Over what?

11:50.305 --> 11:53.339
Ava said she could never settle
for a life like this and...

11:53.409 --> 11:56.540
Irina told her
to stop dreaming and grow up.

11:56.768 --> 11:58.144
I never saw Ava again.

11:58.209 --> 12:00.892
And this was about
three years ago?

12:01.216 --> 12:02.395
Little longer.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.723
It was Julia's first birthday
party. Ava was supposed to be there.

12:05.794 --> 12:09.591
She just didn't show. This
was the last straw for Irina.

12:09.665 --> 12:11.967
Now, what made you think
that Ava was missing?

12:12.033 --> 12:15.743
I went looking for her. Try to patch
things up between the two of them.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.424
But the apartment was empty
and Ava was gone.

12:20.034 --> 12:22.881
Irina said she must have
run off with one of her men.

12:24.449 --> 12:27.798
I had a bad feeling, that's
why I called the police.

12:28.609 --> 12:31.293
Do you know the names
of any of these boyfriends?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.271
Only one. Matt...

12:35.105 --> 12:37.788
Matt Sloane, I think.

12:41.825 --> 12:44.281
Ava was sexy and adventurous.

12:44.353 --> 12:47.320
You mean, kinky?
Let's just say she was wild.

12:47.394 --> 12:51.037
Did you ever tame her? You
know, S&M, bondage, discipline?

12:54.018 --> 12:55.392
I'm not into that.

12:55.490 --> 12:57.115
How long
were you two together?

12:57.185 --> 12:58.615
About four months.

12:58.754 --> 13:01.307
These your girlfriends?
I love beautiful women.

13:01.378 --> 13:02.786
Did you love Ava?

13:02.850 --> 13:06.297
It was a business arrangement. She
was smart, charming, multi-lingual.

13:06.371 --> 13:09.153
She helped me develop business
contacts in Eastern Europe.

13:09.217 --> 13:10.712
And the sex was great.

13:10.785 --> 13:11.995
Yeah,
what'd she get out of it?

13:12.066 --> 13:13.855
Her passion was
expensive jewelry.

13:13.921 --> 13:16.027
She'd throw a tantrum
if I got her anything else.

13:16.098 --> 13:18.815
Like the thousand-dollar bottle
of perfume she threw in my face.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.784
That must've made you angry.
Angry enough to end it.

13:21.891 --> 13:24.411
I terminated our agreement.
Did you see her after that?

13:24.482 --> 13:27.068
Unfortunately, yes,
at a reception at the UN.

13:27.202 --> 13:28.184
Who was she with?

13:28.259 --> 13:29.720
I don't know
who brought her there...

13:29.794 --> 13:32.729
but she left with the Romanian
Deputy Chief of Mission.

13:33.155 --> 13:34.530
A diplomat?

13:34.594 --> 13:36.601
And an importer, and who
knows how many others.

13:36.674 --> 13:39.359
She was definitely a player. She'd
get her hooks into these guys...

13:39.426 --> 13:41.249
for as long as
she could get what she wanted.

13:41.314 --> 13:43.802
When the well ran dry, she'd move
on and drink from the next one.

13:43.874 --> 13:45.979
What about the sister?
They were on the outs.

13:46.050 --> 13:49.727
Ava walked on the wild side while Irina
settled down with the husband, the kid.

13:49.794 --> 13:53.144
We checked Sloane's record. Got picked
up during a undercover vice sting.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.877
One count of
soliciting prostitution.

13:54.947 --> 13:58.329
And he was very specific about what he
wanted, a doggie collar, the whole works.

13:58.403 --> 14:00.956
Unfortunately, his passport
showed he was out of the country...

14:01.026 --> 14:02.456
when Ava
was reported missing.

14:02.531 --> 14:04.385
Find out how
Ava got into the country...

14:04.451 --> 14:07.647
and check whether her former
landlady has anything more to tell us.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.715
What do you want us to do about our
friend from the Romanian Mission?

14:10.786 --> 14:14.300
Well, he has immunity from
arrest, but not from talking to us.

14:14.370 --> 14:16.280
Play nice, maybe he will.

14:20.611 --> 14:23.546
Ava had that odd combination
of greed and innocence.

14:23.619 --> 14:26.008
Very common in girls
from the countryside.

14:26.212 --> 14:28.251
You were
romantically involved?

14:28.322 --> 14:29.501
No.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.545
I attend
many official functions.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.230
I needed at my side a woman who
spoke my language, knew our customs.

14:35.394 --> 14:38.014
And Ava was okay with that?
Very much so.

14:38.243 --> 14:40.314
She got to meet
many important men.

14:40.418 --> 14:43.451
Any of them want her dead?
I can't imagine so.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.393
Look at this orchid.

14:47.010 --> 14:51.385
This orchid took years of
cultivation. A hybrid I developed.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.701
It's beautiful.

14:52.770 --> 14:55.521
Do you know the orchid
is also a parasite?

14:56.483 --> 15:00.126
It devours the host plant
while it blooms magnificently.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.779
Is that how you thought
of Ava, as a parasite?

15:03.555 --> 15:07.133
No, our relationship
was more symbiotic.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.370
We benefited mutually.

15:10.275 --> 15:12.795
Can you tell us how Ava
got into this country?

15:13.795 --> 15:15.999
Our emigration agency
deals with...

15:16.067 --> 15:18.271
thousands upon thousands
of applications...

15:18.339 --> 15:21.787
and there is no way I can tell you
about circumstances of each one.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.768
Besides Ava and I
had never discussed it.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.757
I remember her.

15:29.827 --> 15:33.176
She walked around like she
was the Czarina of 13th street.

15:33.251 --> 15:34.495
This was hers.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.321
Mr. Sanchez?

15:39.459 --> 15:40.922
Ava have
any regular visitors?

15:40.995 --> 15:43.580
Only one I remember.
Older guy.

15:43.939 --> 15:45.826
Always dressed to kill.

15:45.892 --> 15:48.063
Rich uncle?
Sugar daddy.

15:48.132 --> 15:50.270
I see he kept her
in the lap of luxury.

15:50.341 --> 15:53.307
Mercedes owners,
they think they run the world.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.997
He parked his by
the fire hydrant every time.

15:56.068 --> 15:58.523
What'd he look like?
Somebody important.

15:58.595 --> 16:00.123
Specifics
don't concern me.

16:00.196 --> 16:02.496
How about a name?
Too specific.

16:03.716 --> 16:05.374
What'd you do with her stuff?

16:05.444 --> 16:09.240
The place comes completely furnished.
She showed up with one suitcase.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.040
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

16:11.108 --> 16:13.409
She was two months
behind in the rent.

16:13.476 --> 16:17.666
Seeing as how she was murdered,
shouldn't the city reimburse me for that?

16:17.732 --> 16:19.455
Call your councilman.

16:20.452 --> 16:24.479
Ava had a room with a view.
Yeah, of her own grave.

16:28.484 --> 16:30.459
Guy at the Mission
was another one of Ava's boys.

16:30.533 --> 16:33.118
Claims he had no idea how or
why Ava came into this country.

16:33.188 --> 16:36.800
Our immigration was a little more helpful.
Ava came here in '96 on a fiancé visa.

16:36.868 --> 16:40.763
Name of the fiancé: Paul Amis.
Address in Minneola on Long Island.

16:40.837 --> 16:43.739
Arrangements made through an
agency by the name of Euromatch.

16:43.812 --> 16:44.924
Mail-order brides.

16:44.997 --> 16:48.313
I should've tried that instead of the
traditional courtship and wedding ritual...

16:48.388 --> 16:50.298
then I'd be paying less
of my paycheck to alimony.

16:50.373 --> 16:53.438
We'll take the groom, you take the
matchmaker. Maybe you'll get lucky.

16:53.509 --> 16:54.555
Okay.

16:56.004 --> 16:58.078
I shelled out $50,000
to bring Ava here.

16:58.148 --> 17:01.050
You know what the average wage
is in her country? $50 a month.

17:01.125 --> 17:04.737
And all she had to do was cook
and clean and be available for sex.

17:04.805 --> 17:06.463
It's called being a wife.

17:07.396 --> 17:09.219
When'd you last see Ava?

17:09.285 --> 17:11.968
The day I returned her,
after the 90-day trial period.

17:12.037 --> 17:14.589
Didn't work out, huh?
Must have made you angry.

17:14.661 --> 17:16.002
I got my money back.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.435
Did you get a divorce?
Annulment.

17:19.268 --> 17:21.308
This is my wife, May Ling.

17:22.213 --> 17:25.409
Sweetheart, this is Det.
Benson and Det. Stabler.

17:25.701 --> 17:29.214
May I bring you something to drink?
No, doll. They're not staying.

17:29.285 --> 17:31.326
Leave us alone
for another minute.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.535
You didn't tell us
why you returned Ava.

17:37.926 --> 17:41.854
Because I didn't pay all that money
for her to run around with some dentist.

17:42.438 --> 17:45.089
She was exotic. Pretty,
smart, the whole package.

17:45.477 --> 17:47.387
I was ready to take
the big step with Ava.

17:47.462 --> 17:50.277
And the fact that she was already
married had no bearing on that?

17:50.342 --> 17:52.284
Her husband was
beating her up every night.

17:52.358 --> 17:54.747
He once hit her so hard,
I had to put in five caps.

17:54.822 --> 17:56.316
The marriage was over.

17:57.829 --> 17:59.073
Where'd you two meet?

17:59.142 --> 18:01.508
Party. She was there
with her husband.

18:01.574 --> 18:04.291
Someone told her I was known
as the "Dentist to the Stars"...

18:04.358 --> 18:05.699
and she was all over me.

18:05.766 --> 18:07.653
Who called off the wedding plans? I did.

18:07.718 --> 18:09.474
Why?
Because she lied.

18:09.862 --> 18:13.375
She said she was a student, she
had cousins who brought her over.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.809
And you found out otherwise?

18:15.878 --> 18:18.595
I hired a private detective
to do a background check.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.189
Sounds like true love.

18:20.262 --> 18:24.036
I have a very lucrative practice.
I have to take precautions.

18:24.582 --> 18:26.273
I found out
she was a mail-order bride...

18:26.342 --> 18:28.764
like those Russian Natashas,
gold diggers.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.764
Okay. We're gonna need
Ava's dental records.

18:33.575 --> 18:35.461
I'll get them together
for you.

18:39.141 --> 18:41.148
We match girls
with traditional values...

18:41.221 --> 18:43.295
with men who want wives
instead of partners.

18:43.365 --> 18:45.634
You mean, "Stay at home, make
my dinner, do the laundry...

18:45.702 --> 18:47.840
"be available when I need
you for sex," type of woman?

18:47.910 --> 18:49.154
You make it sound
so tawdry.

18:49.221 --> 18:52.386
The divorce rate among our couples
is half that of the population.

18:52.453 --> 18:55.136
If a guy wants to get married,
he needs a fiancé visa...

18:55.206 --> 18:58.108
he has to prove he knew his
wife-to-be before she comes over.

18:58.181 --> 19:02.819
Correct. We send our clients to
Estonia, Romania, Latvia, or Russia...

19:02.886 --> 19:05.636
for two weeks where he meets
maybe eight girls a day.

19:05.702 --> 19:08.866
Once he makes his choice, we
photograph them together for the INS...

19:08.934 --> 19:10.592
and take care
of the paperwork.

19:10.662 --> 19:12.418
And if by some fluke
it doesn't work out?

19:12.486 --> 19:16.228
Satisfaction guaranteed for 90
days, or your money back. Interested?

19:16.293 --> 19:17.308
Too easy.

19:17.382 --> 19:20.033
Without abject suffering, I
wouldn't know what to do with myself.

19:20.102 --> 19:23.811
Green card status on a fiancé
visa is conditional for two years.

19:23.878 --> 19:26.266
If the marriage doesn't last
that long, then what happens?

19:26.342 --> 19:27.903
The girl is usually deported.

19:27.975 --> 19:30.308
Unless she left because
her husband abused her.

19:30.374 --> 19:32.677
Then the INS
will grant an exception.

19:32.742 --> 19:34.947
How often does that happen?
Almost never.

19:35.014 --> 19:37.055
We do thorough
background checks on the men.

19:37.126 --> 19:40.956
You're lucky Ava didn't sue you. Her
hand-picked hubby was a wife-beater.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.266
If we had known that,
we would have intervened.

19:43.335 --> 19:46.946
Sent her to stay with her sister,
Irina. You know about Irina?

19:47.014 --> 19:48.868
She and Ava
came over together.

19:48.934 --> 19:52.032
Fortunately Irina's marriage
is a match made in heaven.

19:53.415 --> 19:55.422
Why didn't you tell us
that Ava was married?

19:55.494 --> 19:57.600
I was afraid.
Of what?

19:57.670 --> 20:00.605
Her husband, he hit me once
when I went to see her.

20:00.679 --> 20:01.856
Why?

20:01.926 --> 20:04.926
Because I told her she should
leave him, and she wouldn't.

20:04.998 --> 20:08.315
He beat her up.
Degraded my sister.

20:08.967 --> 20:10.625
Could he have killed her?

20:11.014 --> 20:12.443
I know he came close.

20:15.718 --> 20:19.264
Civil sexual harassment suit
filed by a former employee.

20:20.999 --> 20:21.981
Wow.

20:22.056 --> 20:25.797
Restraining orders, filed by
your first and second wives.

20:25.864 --> 20:27.587
Hey, I didn't kill Ava.

20:28.008 --> 20:31.618
You forced her to have sex
with you. That's called rape.

20:32.008 --> 20:35.074
You pulled out fistfuls of her
hair, knocked her teeth out.

20:35.144 --> 20:36.638
That's assault.

20:37.287 --> 20:38.235
Prove it.

20:38.311 --> 20:40.995
You think that we'd call you all
the way down here if we couldn't?

20:41.063 --> 20:42.657
Maybe she was
blackmailing him.

20:42.727 --> 20:44.255
Threatening to call the cops.

20:44.328 --> 20:46.018
Is that why you shut her up?
Is that it?

20:54.311 --> 20:55.805
This is like a game of Clue.

20:55.879 --> 20:59.424
Ava went through a diplomat, an
importer, a dentist, and now this loser.

20:59.496 --> 21:01.765
This loser give you anything?
Not yet. Why?

21:01.832 --> 21:04.199
Taylor called.
Wants you down at the lab.

21:04.327 --> 21:06.848
I'll keep this guy on ice
until you get back.

21:09.031 --> 21:11.650
No way these belong
to Ava Parulis.

21:12.649 --> 21:14.055
You got us down here
for that?

21:14.119 --> 21:16.486
The dentist must have made
a mistake. We'll go back.

21:16.551 --> 21:17.958
Don't bother.

21:18.024 --> 21:20.358
The dental work doesn't match,
but everything else does.

21:20.424 --> 21:22.758
Shape of the teeth,
jaw is identical.

21:24.327 --> 21:27.393
Son of a bitch.
Irina is Ava.

21:33.065 --> 21:34.952
I need proof
she killed Irina.

21:35.016 --> 21:37.734
We've got Irina's dental
records. They match the skull.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.524
That doesn't mean
Ava murdered her sister.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.730
Well, she did assume
her identity.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.135
Ava's apartment
overlooked Irina's grave.

21:44.199 --> 21:46.142
Circumstantial.
Give me a motive.

21:46.215 --> 21:47.809
Ava's marriage is annulled.

21:47.879 --> 21:50.531
She doesn't want a one-way trip
back to hard times in Romania.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.704
I need physical evidence
linking them.

21:52.776 --> 21:55.875
Come on, Counselor, we've done
a lot more with a lot less.

21:57.097 --> 21:59.617
All right.
Search the house.

22:01.609 --> 22:04.162
The cars are gone.
Go around back.

22:09.256 --> 22:10.401
Police.

22:14.952 --> 22:16.326
Mrs. Burton?

22:22.344 --> 22:24.254
Go fill in our friends.
Right.

22:37.418 --> 22:39.489
All clear.
Nobody downstairs.

22:39.593 --> 22:41.415
Nothing messed up
in the kid's room.

22:41.481 --> 22:44.131
Ava left in a hurry. She
must've decided not to pack.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.535
Looks like a train
ran through here.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.212
It looks like she took all the
available money they had on hand here.

22:51.113 --> 22:52.542
Get the note.

22:53.641 --> 22:57.951
"I'm sorry. I do love you, George. I never
meant to hurt you or Julia or Irina."

22:58.664 --> 23:01.479
We should talk to the husband.
You mean the brother-in-law.

23:01.544 --> 23:03.454
If she cleaned out
their emergency money...

23:03.528 --> 23:05.154
she may have wiped out
their bank accounts.

23:05.225 --> 23:07.429
We'll finish up here
and check it out.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.193
My wife can't be dead. What are
you talking about? You're crazy.

23:12.264 --> 23:13.825
The dental records prove it.

23:13.898 --> 23:16.931
You're saying Irina is buried
in that grave? We're sorry.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.067
My wife is a loving woman.
She's a good mother.

23:20.136 --> 23:22.657
All Ava ever cared about
was herself and her money.

23:22.728 --> 23:25.893
We've been to the house. Ava's
gone. She packed up and left.

23:26.504 --> 23:29.439
I don't believe that.
She left this note.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.637
I don't care. It's not true.

23:35.112 --> 23:36.487
Mr. Burton.

23:38.185 --> 23:41.413
Irina's crucifix.
Where'd you get that?

23:44.841 --> 23:46.051
From the grave.

23:59.049 --> 24:02.846
When we were first married, she
used to go to Mass every morning...

24:02.922 --> 24:05.475
and then she just stopped
three years ago.

24:06.762 --> 24:08.736
Said she'd lost her faith.

24:10.153 --> 24:13.252
You said you never saw Ava after
she and Irina had a falling-out.

24:13.322 --> 24:15.145
Do you know
if Irina saw her?

24:16.745 --> 24:20.292
Ava called,
said she needed money.

24:21.354 --> 24:23.939
We'd just had the baby
and business was slow...

24:24.138 --> 24:25.895
so Irina went over there...

24:26.474 --> 24:28.710
to explain why
we couldn't help and...

24:29.354 --> 24:31.939
she didn't come back
until 2:00 in the morning.

24:39.402 --> 24:40.929
She killed her.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.577
Did she say anything?

24:45.515 --> 24:47.139
She wouldn't talk.

24:48.747 --> 24:50.372
Said she was sick.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.159
Spent the next two weeks
in bed.

24:56.075 --> 24:57.601
Why would she do this?

24:58.282 --> 25:00.454
That's what
we're trying to find out.

25:01.290 --> 25:02.784
Where's your daughter?

25:03.947 --> 25:05.321
Oh, my God!

25:06.379 --> 25:08.998
"Up, up, up. Faster and faster
the little engine climbed..."

25:09.067 --> 25:10.213
Daddy!

25:11.467 --> 25:13.190
Is there a problem,
Mr. Burton?

25:13.260 --> 25:15.233
No, everything's fine.

25:15.402 --> 25:16.776
You just missed your wife.

25:16.844 --> 25:18.785
When was that?
About 20 minutes.

25:18.859 --> 25:21.445
She seemed upset.
Talked to Julia and then left.

25:22.347 --> 25:24.037
Hi, Julia. You remember us?

25:24.298 --> 25:26.982
Do you know why your mommy
came to see you today?

25:27.499 --> 25:31.274
To give me this.
It has her picture inside it.

25:31.466 --> 25:34.402
Wow, that's pretty. Did
she say where she was going?

25:35.179 --> 25:38.889
No. But she told me that we
couldn't go see the puppet man today.

25:39.115 --> 25:41.603
Who's the puppet man?
Walt. He's nice.

25:41.675 --> 25:43.464
Why do you call him
the puppet man?

25:43.531 --> 25:47.208
Because when Mommy goes to see her
friend, Walt shows me the puppet.

25:48.299 --> 25:50.568
I have no idea
who she's talking about.

25:50.827 --> 25:54.918
Okay, Julia, do you remember
the name of your mommy's friend?

25:56.011 --> 25:58.215
Valentina.
She's nice, too.

25:59.979 --> 26:01.606
We pulled the Burtons'
bank statements.

26:01.675 --> 26:03.584
Yeah? What'd you find?
A lot of zeros.

26:03.659 --> 26:05.350
Ava cleaned out their accounts
this morning.

26:05.420 --> 26:08.070
On top of the $300 she withdraws
on the last Friday of every month.

26:08.139 --> 26:09.284
Her husband
know about this?

26:09.355 --> 26:11.078
All the cancelled checks
have her signature.

26:11.147 --> 26:12.641
She must be paying
the household bills.

26:12.716 --> 26:14.177
Any idea where
the money's going?

26:14.252 --> 26:16.739
We pulled their LUDs. Also on
the last Friday of every month...

26:16.811 --> 26:20.259
one phone call to Euromatch, Valentina
Bilescu's mail-order bride agency.

26:20.332 --> 26:22.023
Olivia just called.

26:22.092 --> 26:24.328
The Burtons' kid said she
and her mother were regulars.

26:24.395 --> 26:28.007
Mom met with Valentina while some guy
entertained the girl with a puppet.

26:28.076 --> 26:29.931
Why is Ava going to
a matchmaker?

26:29.995 --> 26:33.225
I don't know. I think it's time
we paid Miss Bilescu a visit.

26:34.412 --> 26:36.298
Can I help you gentlemen?
Where's Valentina?

26:36.364 --> 26:38.503
Not here.
Not an answer. Where is she?

26:38.572 --> 26:41.255
I haven't done anything illegal.
Really? Where's your puppet?

26:41.323 --> 26:42.567
What are you guys
talking about?

26:42.636 --> 26:44.295
The one you entertain
Julia Burton with...

26:44.363 --> 26:45.989
while her mother's
paying off your boss.

26:46.060 --> 26:48.777
I take the money, give it to
Valentina. I don't know what it's for.

26:48.844 --> 26:50.501
Hear that? Says he
doesn't know what it's for.

26:50.571 --> 26:52.938
He doesn't know that his boss
smuggles women into the country?

26:53.003 --> 26:54.312
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.932
You take the money,
that makes you an accessory.

26:57.003 --> 26:58.912
One more time, where is she?

27:00.619 --> 27:03.849
At her other office. Some
warehouse down in Chelsea.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.351
Not a sweatshop.
The kind you had in mind.

27:09.707 --> 27:12.009
Police!

27:15.115 --> 27:17.482
Where's Valentina?
I don't know about anything.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.653
English.
Do you speak English?

27:19.723 --> 27:21.993
These women aren't being held
against their will, are they?

27:22.059 --> 27:24.993
Because if they are, you're going
for kidnapping, as well as pimping.

27:25.067 --> 27:26.977
Valentina is in there.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.251
What is this?

27:29.324 --> 27:31.234
It's called a raid. Put
your hands behind your back.

27:31.308 --> 27:33.861
Let go of me. Where's your
warrant? Signed on a judge's desk.

27:33.931 --> 27:36.865
Valentina Bilescu, you're under
arrest for unlawful imprisonment...

27:36.940 --> 27:38.664
kidnapping,
and promoting prostitution.

27:38.732 --> 27:41.415
Where's Ava? I don't
have to tell you anything.

27:44.684 --> 27:47.750
What's the cash for?
No. Please, no.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.504
Ava Parulis, you're under arrest
for the murder of Irina Burton.

27:50.572 --> 27:54.052
I didn't kill her!
It's not... It's not Irina!

27:54.124 --> 27:57.059
Who is this?
She's my little sister.

27:57.132 --> 27:58.823
I was buying her freedom.

28:00.428 --> 28:01.638
Take her.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.627
I didn't kill Irina.
So why'd you run?

28:10.701 --> 28:13.832
Didn't murder her, you just happened
to take her identity and her family.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.322
When the bones were
identified, you got scared.

28:16.397 --> 28:18.666
You helped yourself to George
and Irina's bank account.

28:18.732 --> 28:21.450
Figure that'll keep you going for
a while? No. None of it's true.

28:21.516 --> 28:24.387
Then how did Irina end up
underneath the hydrangea...

28:24.461 --> 28:26.249
in the back
of your apartment?

28:26.316 --> 28:27.975
I buried her there!

28:29.549 --> 28:32.331
Right. You buried her
but you didn't murder her?

28:32.461 --> 28:36.073
When I came home that night to
my apartment, Irina was dead.

28:36.141 --> 28:39.654
She was lying on the floor. The
neighbor had his garden dug up.

28:39.725 --> 28:42.791
I put Irina in a garbage bag
and dragged her downstairs.

28:42.861 --> 28:46.122
I covered her with dirt.
I buried her.

28:46.189 --> 28:47.847
What about the collar
and the leash?

28:47.917 --> 28:51.233
They were mine.
I buried my past with Irina.

28:51.309 --> 28:54.058
Well, why didn't you
just call the police?

28:54.924 --> 28:58.023
Whoever killed Irina
was really after me.

28:58.509 --> 29:01.958
Valentina had our sister.
I had to get her out.

29:02.252 --> 29:03.977
Did Valentina
threaten you?

29:07.309 --> 29:09.698
If you cooperate,
we can help you.

29:11.661 --> 29:14.760
In my country,
the police help no one.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.827
Ava kills one sister while
paying to rescue the other?

29:21.902 --> 29:23.559
It doesn't make any sense.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.016
There's no way someone her
size dragged a body down...

29:27.086 --> 29:28.874
three flights of stairs
and then buried it.

29:28.942 --> 29:31.046
If she didn't kill her
sister, what is she hiding?

29:31.118 --> 29:33.452
Maybe she's protecting
whoever did.

29:33.581 --> 29:35.206
Valentina Bilescu?

29:35.950 --> 29:37.674
Let's ask
the other sister.

29:39.310 --> 29:43.368
You didn't know it was Ava? I
haven't seen my sisters for years.

29:44.397 --> 29:46.786
Since Valentina bring me
to this hellhole.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.255
What happened to Irina?

29:49.326 --> 29:52.392
Ava's been impersonating Irina since
she murdered her three years ago.

29:52.463 --> 29:55.659
Ava would never harm Irina
or anyone else.

29:55.726 --> 29:59.042
I want to see her. You
can't. She's going to jail.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.206
Valentina did this.
Why?

30:05.358 --> 30:07.659
She promised me marriage.
A new life.

30:09.230 --> 30:13.125
I went to her parties in
Bucharest to meet American men...

30:13.198 --> 30:15.499
and one of them,
he proposed to me.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.601
So Valentina,
she bring me back here.

30:18.862 --> 30:20.805
Did you get married?
Yes.

30:21.263 --> 30:23.238
But the pig changed his mind.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.405
I thought
I would get deported.

30:26.477 --> 30:29.348
Who let you stay here?
Valentina.

30:31.599 --> 30:33.606
She said she would protect me.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.577
And she take me to that place.
She turned me into a whore.

30:38.223 --> 30:39.881
Why didn't you say no?

30:40.367 --> 30:42.669
No one says no
to Valentina.

30:43.119 --> 30:46.217
How long did she keep you
there? Three-and-a-half years.

30:46.542 --> 30:49.128
Until the debt was paid off.
What debt?

30:49.839 --> 30:54.116
My ex-husband. Valentina
give him back his money.

30:55.342 --> 30:57.797
She say it was my fault
he wasn't satisfied.

30:57.870 --> 31:01.765
That I have to pay her back
for all the money she lost.

31:02.638 --> 31:04.263
Why didn't you run away?

31:05.038 --> 31:08.899
Because Valentina say
she will kill my sisters...

31:10.383 --> 31:12.106
if I went back to Romania.

31:15.054 --> 31:16.264
When can I go?

31:16.335 --> 31:18.342
The only place you're going
is Rikers Island.

31:18.414 --> 31:20.008
I'll make bail.

31:20.653 --> 31:23.851
Don't count on it. Judges don't
usually send accused killers home.

31:23.919 --> 31:25.347
Who did I kill?

31:25.423 --> 31:28.238
You're being charged as an accessory
to the murder of Irina Burton.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.532
I am not a killer. I bring
American men the brides they want.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.388
You mean,
the women you kidnap.

31:33.455 --> 31:35.691
I brought these girls here
to marry, have a better life.

31:35.758 --> 31:38.508
I sheltered them after
their husbands rejected them.

31:38.575 --> 31:41.772
You forced them into prostitution.
You can't prove anything.

31:41.839 --> 31:44.872
When Ava Parulis threatened to blow
the whistle, you decided to kill her.

31:44.943 --> 31:48.358
Except you got her sister
by mistake. Who helped you?

31:51.471 --> 31:53.642
Get me my lawyer. Now.

31:55.855 --> 31:57.198
Valentina gave me nothing.

31:57.263 --> 31:59.368
And Ava's acting more like
a victim than a perp.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.610
She hooked up with Valentina,
got in over her head.

32:01.679 --> 32:02.988
They're both afraid
of someone.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.516
If Valentina's not gonna
tell us who...

32:04.592 --> 32:06.566
maybe there's something
in her office that will.

32:06.638 --> 32:08.265
Oksana's statements
about the death threats...

32:08.335 --> 32:10.702
should be more than enough
probable cause for a search warrant.

32:10.767 --> 32:11.782
I'll call it in.

32:11.856 --> 32:14.311
I'll have John and Fin execute
it. Bring George Burton in.

32:14.383 --> 32:17.133
He may be able to help us
get something out of Ava.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.447
What do you guys want now?
This is a search warrant.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.341
Where does Valentina
keep her financial records?

32:23.407 --> 32:24.584
At the accountant's.

32:24.656 --> 32:26.631
Not those records. The real
books for her whorehouse.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.110
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:28.175 --> 32:29.801
You don't know much
for a valued employee?

32:29.871 --> 32:31.781
Maybe he knows
what accessory to a murder is.

32:31.855 --> 32:33.644
Murder? I'm just a clerk.

32:33.711 --> 32:35.816
Who is Valentina's partner?
I don't know.

32:35.887 --> 32:39.302
Did any of Valentina's friends
hang around here more than others?

32:39.504 --> 32:42.537
Some old guy, same accent,
always in a suit.

32:42.799 --> 32:44.261
Comes in
a couple times a week.

32:44.335 --> 32:46.954
He and Valentina always lock
themselves in her office.

32:47.024 --> 32:49.544
Maybe that's where they keep
the real books.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.629
Follow me.

32:53.583 --> 32:58.319
What have we got? Valentina's
silent partner. A Razvan Toscu.

32:58.383 --> 33:00.718
Romanian Deputy Chief
of Mission and orchid lover.

33:00.785 --> 33:02.759
Which means he could run
you down, leave skid marks...

33:02.832 --> 33:04.741
and we still couldn't issue
a speeding ticket.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.184
With his diplomatic juice he may
have been able to get visas...

33:07.248 --> 33:09.289
keep product in
the pipeline, girls...

33:09.360 --> 33:11.750
We'll deal with him later.
What about George Burton?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.482
Says he's willing to play.

33:16.593 --> 33:19.178
There's another sister?
We have her upstairs.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.809
Where did you find her?

33:20.881 --> 33:22.735
She was being
held against her will...

33:22.800 --> 33:24.208
and forced into prostitution.

33:24.273 --> 33:26.215
We found Ava there
trying to buy her freedom.

33:26.289 --> 33:28.263
With the money
that she stole from you.

33:28.336 --> 33:30.125
Why didn't she tell me?

33:30.192 --> 33:33.292
Maybe she thought you'd be
in danger if you knew.

33:35.345 --> 33:37.766
You sure
you're ready for this?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.052
No.

33:44.496 --> 33:47.017
When are you going
to let me out of here?

33:48.881 --> 33:50.441
No, it's me, Ava.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.738
I didn't expect you to come.

33:57.808 --> 34:00.013
You shared my bed
for three years.

34:00.976 --> 34:02.503
You raised my daughter.

34:05.265 --> 34:07.915
And it was a lie?

34:08.721 --> 34:10.063
Irina was dead.

34:11.024 --> 34:13.097
She would have wanted this.

34:16.018 --> 34:18.123
They know about
the Toscu guy.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.601
If he finds out, he's gonna
kill you, like he killed Irina.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.652
Why did he kill Irina?

34:24.719 --> 34:28.714
Because I threatened to tell the police
about him if he didn't let Oksana go.

34:29.393 --> 34:31.335
How do you know
he killed Irina?

34:31.409 --> 34:35.206
I saw him,
outside my apartment building.

34:35.728 --> 34:38.762
He left something next to
the trash in a plastic bag.

34:38.833 --> 34:41.996
I looked inside
and it was Irina.

34:44.114 --> 34:48.588
I put on her wedding rings, and
buried her under the neighbor's garden.

34:52.402 --> 34:55.717
He raped her.
He made her wear the collar.

34:57.585 --> 35:00.171
He did to her
what he used to do to me.

35:00.721 --> 35:04.137
How could you let that happen?
I wasn't there!

35:05.585 --> 35:07.472
I couldn't stop him.

35:09.584 --> 35:12.335
Irina never told him
it wasn't me.

35:16.146 --> 35:17.706
Why didn't you tell me?

35:18.193 --> 35:22.383
As long as they thought
I was dead, we were safe.

35:24.817 --> 35:26.279
All the men...

35:28.722 --> 35:31.886
the jewelry,
the money I took from you...

35:34.417 --> 35:38.411
all I wanted it for
was to get Oksana out.

35:42.577 --> 35:44.007
I'm so sorry.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.688
You're sorry.

35:53.618 --> 35:57.741
Sorry won't bring Irina back.
George, please.

36:00.946 --> 36:02.954
How could you
live with yourself?

36:15.474 --> 36:17.000
So, we believe her?

36:17.075 --> 36:19.791
She might be lying to us,
but she wasn't lying to him.

36:19.859 --> 36:22.412
Which makes her the only one
to put Toscu at the scene.

36:22.483 --> 36:24.305
We could have videotape
of him in the act...

36:24.370 --> 36:27.217
we still couldn't touch him
because of his diplomatic immunity.

36:27.283 --> 36:29.901
Alex, there's got to be
something you can do.

36:30.578 --> 36:32.301
Let me check with a friend.

36:34.418 --> 36:36.141
I need
the State Department's help.

36:36.210 --> 36:39.374
It's almost impossible to convince a
foreign nation, even a friendly one...

36:39.442 --> 36:41.166
to waive
diplomatic immunity.

36:41.235 --> 36:43.275
Precedent was set
by the former Soviet Union.

36:43.347 --> 36:46.576
The Republic of Georgia waived immunity
on that drunk driving case down in D.C.

36:46.642 --> 36:48.300
All those former
Soviet Republics...

36:48.371 --> 36:50.442
were looking for
most-favored-nation status.

36:50.515 --> 36:53.450
I'm looking to put away a murderer,
and I don't care where he's from.

36:53.523 --> 36:56.391
We can always appeal to their
decency and see what happens.

36:56.467 --> 37:00.078
What are you suggesting? A
long shot. But it's worth a try.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.410
My government respectfully
requests you...

37:03.474 --> 37:05.710
to waive Mr. Toscu's
diplomatic immunity.

37:05.779 --> 37:08.016
That's an
extraordinary request.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.254
Warranted by
extraordinary circumstances.

37:10.323 --> 37:11.949
Mr. Toscu has used
his position...

37:12.019 --> 37:13.961
to keep women in this
country against their will...

37:14.035 --> 37:17.068
for the purposes of
prostitution. Now he's a murderer.

37:17.267 --> 37:20.976
We didn't invite you here to be
insulted by baseless allegations.

37:21.043 --> 37:24.392
Mr. Toscu is a distinguished
member of our diplomatic corps.

37:24.531 --> 37:28.328
Here's what your distinguished diplomat
did to a woman from your own country.

37:28.403 --> 37:29.865
Let me see that.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.472
Tragic.

37:37.107 --> 37:38.700
And you think
I'm responsible?

37:38.771 --> 37:41.227
Miss Cabot assures me
that she has an eyewitness...

37:41.299 --> 37:45.325
who places Mr. Toscu at the murder
scene carrying the victim's body.

37:45.395 --> 37:48.778
Her sister.
Ava Parulis?

37:49.203 --> 37:52.716
She has quite a reputation.
I'm surprised you'd believe her.

37:53.139 --> 37:55.277
Before we even consider
something as severe...

37:55.348 --> 37:57.966
and irrevocable as waiving
our diplomat's immunity...

37:58.036 --> 37:59.825
we must be convinced of guilt.

37:59.891 --> 38:02.096
The evidence
is right in front of you.

38:02.324 --> 38:04.659
You have nothing
but the word of criminals...

38:04.724 --> 38:08.618
and the eyewitness account of a woman
who buried her sister in a shallow grave.

38:08.692 --> 38:12.718
We assert our sovereign rights
to protect our country's diplomat.

38:12.788 --> 38:16.084
And we have the right to protect
our country from your diplomats.

38:16.148 --> 38:18.799
Alex. Mr. Davia, you're
leaving us no alternative.

38:18.868 --> 38:22.610
My government has authorized me to
declare Mr. Toscu persona non grata.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.098
He has 48 hours
to leave the United States.

38:29.204 --> 38:32.401
That's it? He walks? I didn't
know Greenwalt was gonna do that.

38:32.468 --> 38:34.509
Why didn't he just
threaten him with expulsion?

38:34.580 --> 38:37.678
Jack said, had the Romanians known our
government was even considering this...

38:37.749 --> 38:39.952
they would have put Toscu on
the first plane to Bucharest.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.362
So the bastard murders
a woman...

38:41.428 --> 38:43.730
and his only consequence
is being sent home?

38:43.797 --> 38:45.684
At least
it bought us some time.

38:45.748 --> 38:47.242
What do you need
from us, Alex?

38:47.316 --> 38:49.651
Something more than
Ava Parulis' word.

38:49.812 --> 38:51.470
But there's nothing left.

38:51.828 --> 38:55.124
We want Toscu, we need proof
he's guilty. Physical evidence.

38:56.117 --> 38:57.840
Go back to the bones.

38:58.261 --> 39:00.530
This report on soil samples
is a real page turner.

39:00.597 --> 39:03.017
Very descriptive. Written from
the point of view of a slug.

39:03.093 --> 39:04.784
The good earth
swallowed our evidence.

39:04.853 --> 39:06.194
Maybe not all of it.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.950
You found something?

39:08.404 --> 39:11.917
Irina's clothes were pretty decomposed
but they did find a couple of samples...

39:11.987 --> 39:15.501
from her panties and the lab
sent them to a forensic geologist.

39:15.572 --> 39:17.033
Where's the report?

39:18.804 --> 39:20.397
Due back next week.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.921
You know how many
microorganisms there are in soil?

39:22.996 --> 39:26.029
If we test everything, you'll still
be getting results 10 years from now.

39:26.100 --> 39:29.712
Yeah. These samples. Found on what
was left of the victim's clothing.

39:32.468 --> 39:33.581
What are those?

39:33.652 --> 39:36.882
Horticulturalists use them to
collect and store microscopic pollen.

39:36.948 --> 39:40.363
The samples your lab sent us weren't
consistent with the plant life in the area.

39:40.437 --> 39:42.640
Okay. What did your tests
show? I haven't tested them yet.

39:42.709 --> 39:44.716
When are you gonna test them?
Tomorrow morning.

39:44.788 --> 39:46.066
How about now?

39:58.292 --> 40:00.561
Good morning, Detectives.
Come to see me off?

40:00.629 --> 40:02.417
You're not getting away
with this.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.688
I'll send you a card
from my next post.

40:05.525 --> 40:07.499
I hope
it's a warmer climate.

40:08.053 --> 40:09.197
What is this?

40:09.269 --> 40:11.243
You're under arrest for
the murder of Irina Burton.

40:11.317 --> 40:13.259
You cannot arrest me
I have diplomatic immunity.

40:13.333 --> 40:14.959
Had diplomatic immunity
until this morning.

40:15.028 --> 40:17.298
Your government doesn't appreciate
your sideline business...

40:17.365 --> 40:19.470
as a murderer and a pimp.
They cut you loose.

40:19.541 --> 40:21.712
You have no evidence.
Sure we do.

40:22.069 --> 40:25.844
Two little grains of pollen
belonging to the Gigas Firmin Lambeau.

40:26.388 --> 40:28.276
My orchids?
Found on Irina's clothing.

40:28.341 --> 40:30.545
You should have washed your
hands before you murdered her.

40:30.614 --> 40:31.562
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:31.606 --> 40:34.671
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

40:40.246 --> 40:41.674
Detectives.

40:44.565 --> 40:47.632
Thank you. Thank us
when Toscu's convicted.

40:48.053 --> 40:49.232
We're very sorry for your loss.

40:49.302 --> 40:51.985
We hope everything works out
for you and Julia.

40:52.052 --> 40:55.314
We'll be all right.
We have to.

40:59.381 --> 41:03.538
Ava could have gone on forever
being Burton's wife, Julia's mother.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.612
If it hadn't been for the bones.

41:14.870 --> 41:16.943
Irina can rest in peace now.
