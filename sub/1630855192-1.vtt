WEBVTT

00:54.096 --> 00:56.473
Attention, attention.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.559
Three minutes
to full concert rehearsal.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.229
Three minutes
to full concert rehearsal.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.911
Hey.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.801
-Mademoiselle.
-So nice we can do this.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.637
Grazie.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.700
Go!

01:57.826 --> 01:59.203
Careful.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.136
Quickly!

02:24.686 --> 02:26.271
Thank you.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.393
Move, move, move!

03:04.393 --> 03:06.019
Charlie, what's your status?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.272
-In position.
-Copy.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.358
-Thermal count's 15.
-Right, warriors, are we ready?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.280
Remember, this is our game.
This is what we're made for.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.491
Keep it calm, steady and ready.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.327
You know the drill.
We've done it 100 times before.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.872
In and out, quick.
Keep it clean, no dirty boots.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.415
We'll be home before dinner.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.000
Dinner at your place.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.918
Yeah, Helene's cooking,
you do the dishes.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.881
Alright, let's rock and roll.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.591
-Turn off the lights.
-Copy.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.217
Go to silent.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.931
You are probably all wondering,

03:42.931 --> 03:45.309
why have these monsters...

03:45.309 --> 03:48.187
...taken
the National Opera hostage,

03:48.187 --> 03:49.605
the night...

03:49.605 --> 03:52.816
...before
their grand opening performance?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.986
Team leader in position.
Enemy in sight.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.197
Copy that.
Charlie heading in position.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.991
I assure you, we do not.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.284
John?

04:02.284 --> 04:05.621
I see it.
All teams, wait for my order.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.247
Copy. Waiting for the orders.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.459
Our agenda is strictly monetary.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.960
I don't know, John.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.755
He's bluffing.
It's all about money.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.300
...conduct again,
all you have to do

04:18.300 --> 04:23.263
is help us meet our goal
of 300 million. And to...

04:23.263 --> 04:26.391
...show you the kind of
production

04:26.391 --> 04:29.186
we hope to entertain...
...you with.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.395
Miss Mollini.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.272
-Let me ice this prick.
-No.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.900
Wait till we're all in position.
We can floor him.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.069
Come, come, come, come.

04:37.069 --> 04:41.156
Our...
...beautiful nightingale,
please...

04:41.156 --> 04:43.283
...sing for us.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.162
Easy, soldier, he's bluffing.

04:47.162 --> 04:50.040
Sing. Sing for us.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.043
Sing for us one...

04:53.043 --> 04:55.170
...last time.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.297
No!

04:57.297 --> 04:59.758
Stand down, you hear me?
Stand down.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.051
You have one hour.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.053
Screw that!

05:08.308 --> 05:11.687
No, Matteo! Goddammit!

05:13.146 --> 05:15.107
All positions, we're moving in!

05:15.107 --> 05:16.316
Move, move, move!

05:17.192 --> 05:19.027
Copy that, moving in.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.578
-Bravo, moving in.
-Go, go, go!

05:27.578 --> 05:28.954
-Moving in.
-Copy.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
Matteo, on your left!

05:30.622 --> 05:31.957
Fuck, ah!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.626
Ah, son of a bitch!

05:34.626 --> 05:36.879
Behind you! Shit.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.630
Charlie entering backstage area.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.591
On your right.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.846
I think I got him.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.725
-Clear.
-Come on!

05:49.725 --> 05:51.393
Matteo, come on!

05:55.314 --> 05:57.232
-Entrance clear.
-Come on!

06:08.243 --> 06:10.329
Come to the stage now, quick!

06:10.329 --> 06:12.289
-To the stage!
-Copy. Coming your way.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.169
Come here, asshole!

06:18.086 --> 06:21.423
Two enemies down.
Securing main stage.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.050
Team Bravo, clear.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.928
Team Charlie, clear.

06:25.928 --> 06:27.471
Team Alpha, clear.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.682
What the hell is wrong
with you, soldier?

06:30.682 --> 06:33.268
I gave you a direct order. Huh?

06:34.520 --> 06:38.190
You're gonna get us all killed.
You jeopardized the mission.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.442
I gave you an order, soldier.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.069
-Shit.
-Damn.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.321
-What's wrong?
-I'm hit. I'm hit.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.783
-You're hit? Medic!
-No, it's okay.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.202
It's not that bad. Not that bad.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.621
Team leader down! Medic!

06:52.621 --> 06:55.082
Medic's on the way.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.961
I think you'd better
call Helene.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.797
Tell her we'll be a little late
for dinner.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.465
No, we'll make it.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.343
-Fuck.
-You'll be fine.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.013
-We got them all, right?
-Yeah, we got them all.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.140
We saved everybody.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.893
No, you haven't saved anyone.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.229
I'm just gonna blow up
this place.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.064
Do it.

07:32.578 --> 07:36.665
John! John!

07:41.128 --> 07:45.340
Team up on the stage.
We lost the team leader.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.718
Repeat: Lost team leader.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.921
Watch it.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.615
Whoo! Hey. Hey, beauty.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.707
Such a good girl.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.083
Angie.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.005
Whoa whoa whoa.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.423
It's a fish.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.636
Go!

09:54.636 --> 09:57.681
Angie, smile.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.778
-You quitting?
-I gotta keep moving.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.951
Well, you're leaving me short.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.288
So, this is what you get.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.602
-Bucharest?
-Yes, of course.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.158
Well, well, well.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.078
What do we have here?

11:43.078 --> 11:47.958
The Sindikheth and Consociation
all gathered here together.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.960
Must be
a super special occasion.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.546
Like one of those weddings

11:52.546 --> 11:55.090
where all the relatives
you forgot you had

11:55.090 --> 11:57.426
show up to the free buffet.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.677
Is that what this is?

11:58.677 --> 12:01.597
A joining of two spirits?
How sweet.

12:01.597 --> 12:06.226
Look at this.
My favorite breakfast.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.228
This one comes with a present.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.106
Keeps you going all day.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.904
So, who's the lucky bride?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.908
What did you say?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.372
That's no way to talk to a lady.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.587
You fucking son of a bitch.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.591
Get the fuck up!
Spitting on my shoe, huh?

12:39.009 --> 12:41.345
Move!

12:43.138 --> 12:45.182
Sorry I didn't
bring flowers, eh.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.856
Come on, stand up.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.118
-Tell me.
-Interpol was waiting for us.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.871
-And the shipment?
-Gone.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.318
Watch it, man. Watch it.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.866
Do you have any idea

13:43.866 --> 13:46.702
how hard it is to get blood
out of Italian calfskin?

13:46.702 --> 13:49.705
No. Why don't you
try some water, huh?

13:49.705 --> 13:50.914
Oh, you're an expert now?

13:53.917 --> 13:55.294
Don't be a girl.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.922
Okay, Roman. That's
a shipment off the streets.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.091
But it doesn't put us any closer
to the big players.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.052
Actually, it does.
So take the win, Shira.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.890
Hitting the Consociation and
the Sindikheth at the same time

14:07.890 --> 14:09.308
puts a pressure on them

14:09.308 --> 14:11.476
while they're trying
to link up together.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.104
Boss, we could get a medal
for this shit.

14:16.398 --> 14:17.900
Fine.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.902
But I want
the whole Consociation,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.653
not its droppings.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.405
I know it's personal.

14:23.405 --> 14:26.450
But I promise you,
this was just a warm-up.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.746
Now we crank the heat and
we force them to make a mistake.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.548
The train to Dordrecht,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.259
Lage Zwaluwe and Roosendaal,

14:44.259 --> 14:48.555
scheduled at 8:31 p.m.,
departs from platform...

14:58.524 --> 15:00.651
Yeah, Nick,
let me cut to the chase.

15:00.651 --> 15:04.905
So, it's an ERC20 blockchain
called Taltos.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.242
Every database will be using it
within two years,

15:08.242 --> 15:10.786
and now for a small
no-risk investment

15:10.786 --> 15:12.538
you can get in on it now.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.582
Uh, just 15 million euros.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.918
I know

15:17.918 --> 15:20.838
I know they've been telling that
crypto's been dead for years,

15:20.838 --> 15:23.423
but, hey, the only place
it's going is up.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.552
Oh, come on, Nick.

15:26.552 --> 15:30.305
Help me make the ICO.
You'll be glad you did it.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.854
Okay, I guess we'll have to see
how you feel about that

15:36.854 --> 15:39.648
when you see me cruising by
in a new Bentley.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.734
Right. Okay.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.529
Okay, thanks.
Thanks, talk to you later.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.252
-I'm looking for...
-You're so tall.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.297
Can you get a cat
out of the tree?

16:45.297 --> 16:47.090
Can you dunk a basketball?

16:49.301 --> 16:50.761
Is Helene Meyers home?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.472
Meyers...

16:54.556 --> 16:56.016
Mommy!

16:57.059 --> 17:01.647
Mommy,
there is somebody at the door!

17:02.231 --> 17:04.399
Who is it, sweetheart?

17:04.399 --> 17:07.069
I don't know, but he's big.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.036
Hey.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.584
Where have you been?

17:27.214 --> 17:29.591
Angie, do you remember Matteo?

17:29.591 --> 17:32.177
-He's a friend of your dad's.
-Paul?

17:32.177 --> 17:35.722
-No, honey, your dad.
-You knew my real dad?

17:39.309 --> 17:40.936
He was my best friend.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.523
Did he like broccoli?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.529
-No.
-I knew it.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.407
Well...

17:54.741 --> 17:56.952
Don't stand there like a lug.
Come inside.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.328
I'll make some coffee.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.109
His name is Paul.
We got married last year.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.612
He's been good to us.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.495
We missed you at John's funeral.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.207
Yeah.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.876
I wanted to come.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.129
-But...
-I know.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.256
We all lost a lot that day.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.259
It's just that...

18:56.303 --> 18:59.932
You were like his brother.
Always there for him.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.184
It would have been nice if you
could have been there for us

19:02.184 --> 19:04.645
when we needed you.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.898
Anyway,
it's good you're here now.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.069
I came because...

19:14.363 --> 19:16.657
there's something
I needed to tell you.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.160
What?

19:24.081 --> 19:27.501
-It was my fault John died.
-No, stop.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.003
-I wasn't fast enough.
-I said stop.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.464
-It should have been me.
-Shut up!

19:36.718 --> 19:38.554
You don't get to come here,

19:38.554 --> 19:41.682
not after I moved on,
and make me relive my grief.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.518
Look at me.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.896
You don't get to do that.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.984
Not when you couldn't even
be bothered

19:51.984 --> 19:53.569
to show up for his funeral.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.197
What kind of brother does that?

20:09.001 --> 20:10.294
I'm sorry.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.893
Fuck.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.700
Matteo.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.203
Do you have anywhere to stay?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.248
I'll find something.
I'll be fine.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.210
We have an extra room,
so come back inside.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.087
Please.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.400
What is this?

21:16.276 --> 21:20.280
It's mushroom stew, sir.
One of our most popular dishes.

21:21.782 --> 21:24.243
This is the famous
mushroom stew?

21:27.162 --> 21:29.414
Why isn't anyone else having it?

21:32.751 --> 21:35.295
How many times are we gonna have
this conversation?

21:37.005 --> 21:40.175
I'm gonna give you
another month. Okay?

21:40.175 --> 21:42.511
One more month.

21:42.511 --> 21:46.765
And then maybe I bring in
a new chef, a new menu. Yeah?

21:48.183 --> 21:49.643
Think that's fair?

21:54.022 --> 21:57.693
-Anything else, sir?
-People. Ha!

21:57.693 --> 22:00.320
I'd like some people. People.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.823
Go.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.991
Thank you.

22:19.882 --> 22:21.466
That was a good day.

22:23.886 --> 22:26.180
-Yeah.
-It's for you.

22:27.556 --> 22:28.599
Thanks.

22:29.224 --> 22:32.519
You know, I kept all his things.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.855
His clothes, medals,
everything, so...

22:35.731 --> 22:38.233
if you need anything, take it.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.943
He would have liked that.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.576
Matteo.

22:49.203 --> 22:51.830
It really is good to see you.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.707
It's just that...

22:53.707 --> 22:55.584
I'm sorry it took so long.

22:58.003 --> 23:00.839
Matteo!

23:00.839 --> 23:03.926
And now you're gonna have to
deal with your new best friend.

23:03.926 --> 23:05.594
Yeah.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.221
Matteo?

23:08.013 --> 23:10.098
See these two?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.059
They are running
the whole investigation.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.277
Taking pictures?

23:27.783 --> 23:29.535
I spoke to our Mr Nay.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.788
We both agree that whether
this rat is in my house

23:32.788 --> 23:34.456
or in his house,

23:34.456 --> 23:36.917
we don't continue business
until it's found.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.961
-Mmm, yeah.
-Now, if it is in my house,

23:38.961 --> 23:42.256
it's up to you two to find it.
Fast.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.639
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:50.639 --> 23:52.850
-How was your day?
-Well...

23:54.059 --> 23:55.936
Where's the hobbit?

23:55.936 --> 23:57.145
There.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.986
There you go.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.741
Why is she having a tea party
with a giant?

24:10.659 --> 24:13.161
That's Matteo, John's friend.

24:13.161 --> 24:17.332
He stopped by today and I don't
think he's got anywhere to go,

24:17.332 --> 24:20.961
so I thought maybe we could
take him in for a few days.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.172
Of course.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.596
I think we should get him
a new chair.

24:31.388 --> 24:33.599
He's gonna break that one.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.192
Santé.

24:43.192 --> 24:45.611
Cheers,
everybody, it's a real honor.

25:07.382 --> 25:11.386
Message
to return. Target two miles.

25:11.386 --> 25:15.224
Target number
Alpha Bravo 1-0-0-4. Over.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.893
Copy that.

25:17.893 --> 25:21.438
You remember that girl
at Cappie's retirement party?

25:21.438 --> 25:23.065
The one
in the blue dress, you mean?

25:23.065 --> 25:24.316
That's the one. Skylar.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.777
You pretended you were too drunk
to dance.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.112
I don't dance.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.823
Why? Are you too tall?
You think you'd look stupid?

25:31.823 --> 25:35.035
I've seen you dance.

25:37.079 --> 25:40.332
-We're in position. Ready to go.
-Copy that.

25:40.332 --> 25:44.419
Look, all I'm saying is
that when we get back home,

25:44.419 --> 25:46.922
you oughta give that girl
a call.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.757
Take her out for dinner.

25:48.757 --> 25:52.052
-That's Helene's idea, isn't it?
-No. No, no.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.180
Did she say something
about it too?

25:56.431 --> 26:00.185
Just that if I didn't call her,
I was gonna die alone.

26:00.185 --> 26:03.814
I fucking love that woman.

26:03.814 --> 26:06.525
She went straight
for the jugular, huh?

26:06.525 --> 26:08.735
She just wants you to be happy.

26:09.695 --> 26:12.865
-Tell her I am happy.
-You tell her yourself.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.493
But I bet she loves it when
you're out in the field, huh?

26:16.493 --> 26:17.911
Instead of hanging
around the house.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.789
At least when I'm out here,
she can't hound me

26:20.789 --> 26:23.876
about building those gazebos
in the back yard, man.

26:23.876 --> 26:27.296
Oh, there we go.
Target in sight.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.506
By the way...

26:29.506 --> 26:31.258
Helene's pregnant.

26:31.258 --> 26:33.260
Couldn't you wait
until after the shot?

26:34.970 --> 26:37.681
I thought you wanted to know.

26:39.016 --> 26:42.769
Any idea who the father is?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.354
I got a pretty good idea.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.148
Coast clear. Bravo, move in.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.774
-You fucker.
-Bravo moving in.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.484
We've got the assets.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.944
See you
at the rendezvous point.

26:51.612 --> 26:54.281
You give
that Skylar girl a call.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.782
I'll think about it.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.660
You think about it?
There's nothing to think about.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.456
You do it when we get home.

27:07.085 --> 27:10.088
Angie?
You coming to bed?

27:10.088 --> 27:11.131
Come.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.761
-I like him.
-You do?

27:17.179 --> 27:18.472
Me too.

27:18.472 --> 27:21.475
He's been alone for a long time.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.979
I think he needs a new friend.

27:25.979 --> 27:28.148
You're right, honey.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.028
-Goodnight, honey.
-Goodnight.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.288
There you go, buddy.

27:55.968 --> 28:00.013
Bet you've seen beautiful skies
all over the world, huh?

28:06.562 --> 28:08.397
You got a favorite spot?

28:10.357 --> 28:12.109
Afghanistan.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.319
Seriously?

28:16.113 --> 28:19.199
The night there
is quiet. It's...

28:21.660 --> 28:22.870
peaceful.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.748
Must be hard,

28:26.748 --> 28:30.210
coming home
with nothing left to fight for.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.507
There's always something
to fight for.

28:38.427 --> 28:39.595
Yeah.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.806
Of course.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.854
Good talking to you. Goodnight.

29:01.617 --> 29:04.036
He's not gonna pee
on the carpet.

29:04.036 --> 29:06.872
No.

29:07.915 --> 29:11.001
-But he's just like...
-Like what?

29:11.001 --> 29:13.378
Uh... I don't know.

29:14.296 --> 29:16.465
I was just trying to find
a nice way

29:16.465 --> 29:18.509
to say "like he's damaged."

29:21.345 --> 29:22.554
You know...

29:23.472 --> 29:26.433
John never could talk much
about it, but...

29:28.060 --> 29:30.812
the things they did,
they saw over there,

29:30.812 --> 29:33.106
they deal with it different
than us.

29:33.106 --> 29:37.319
Okay? So, try and cut him
a little slack.

29:37.319 --> 29:40.322
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm just a little, uh...

29:40.322 --> 29:42.157
What? Intimidated?

29:42.157 --> 29:46.119
Hey, cut me some slack,
will you?

29:47.579 --> 29:50.332
He's a ghost from your past,
so maybe I am a little bit.

29:50.332 --> 29:54.086
Well, you shouldn't be.
'Cause I'm not looking back.

29:54.086 --> 29:57.005
I'm moving forward.
It's all I want to do now.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.801
I hope it's not all
you want to do.

31:32.518 --> 31:35.437
I'm late.
I can't do this every day.

31:37.481 --> 31:40.359
Will you take care
of Daisy for me?

31:42.402 --> 31:43.779
Yeah.

31:43.779 --> 31:45.989
Will you be here
when I get back?

31:46.615 --> 31:47.741
I don't know.

31:47.741 --> 31:50.285
Then we can have
another tea party.

31:50.285 --> 31:53.330
How can you say no to that?

31:55.415 --> 31:56.375
Thank you.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.879
Bye, Daisy!

32:09.012 --> 32:12.432
Yes, James,
you can count on that of course.

32:13.225 --> 32:14.518
Uh...

32:15.936 --> 32:18.188
Let me call you right back.
Okay.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.234
-Gabriel.
-Paul.

32:22.234 --> 32:23.652
Hey.

32:23.652 --> 32:26.947
-Well, please.
-Sit down.

32:27.823 --> 32:33.120
Uh, can I get you something?
Coffee, tea, Dr Pepper?

32:33.120 --> 32:36.456
No, caffeine upsets
my acid reflux.

32:37.541 --> 32:40.335
Well, you coming here
isn't exactly good

32:40.335 --> 32:42.713
for my acid reflux either.

32:42.713 --> 32:45.215
-What's going on?
-I don't know, Paul.

32:45.215 --> 32:48.010
I was hoping you could tell me
what's going on.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.348
-What is this? A riddle?
-Yes, it's a riddle.

32:53.348 --> 32:57.102
And the riddle is: What the fuck
happened to my 15 million euros

32:57.102 --> 33:01.023
that mysteriously disappeared
from my accounts, Paul?

33:01.982 --> 33:04.526
-Oh.
-Oh.

33:04.526 --> 33:07.821
Uh... Let me check it out.

33:09.031 --> 33:10.324
Uh...

33:13.911 --> 33:18.874
Okay. Okay, yeah, now...
Okay, I see it. Uhm...

33:18.874 --> 33:22.169
There were some complications
and I should have let you know.

33:24.505 --> 33:25.756
Complications?

33:27.424 --> 33:29.718
With my money.
What kind of complications?

33:29.718 --> 33:31.178
Well, this uh...

33:32.054 --> 33:35.557
This software we're using, uh,
it updated itself.

33:35.557 --> 33:39.728
And, uh,
now there's a damn glitch.

33:39.728 --> 33:43.023
Something to do with routing
numbers and time zones.

33:43.023 --> 33:45.275
It's all over my head, really,

33:45.275 --> 33:47.236
but basically
it stopped tracking

33:47.236 --> 33:49.738
our encrypted transfers
in real time.

33:52.658 --> 33:56.662
Could you get me someone
over at ZeroTech, please. Yeah?

33:56.662 --> 33:59.540
-I'll have it fixed ASAP.
-Oh good, okay.

33:59.540 --> 34:02.376
So it's just me being
paranoid here. We're fine?

34:02.376 --> 34:05.128
The money's all there, you just
can't see it right now. See?

34:05.128 --> 34:08.048
No, Paul, I don't see.
That's the problem, you know?

34:08.048 --> 34:12.177
But I like you. And I know
you'd never fuck me because...

34:12.177 --> 34:13.804
that would make you crazy.

34:16.098 --> 34:19.351
I'll get it fixed by tomorrow.

34:19.351 --> 34:22.312
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah, that's right.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.730
No more complications.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.984
No more, and if there are, uh...

34:26.984 --> 34:29.319
then I'll have bigger issues
to worry about.

34:29.319 --> 34:32.865
No. No, Paul, you
wouldn't have bigger issues. No.

34:32.865 --> 34:35.617
You wouldn't have any issues.

34:40.122 --> 34:41.748
This your family?

34:41.748 --> 34:44.585
God, that is a handsome woman.
Handsome.

34:45.627 --> 34:48.922
You know, we should have dinner
one time. We've never done that.

34:49.631 --> 34:51.633
-No.
-I got a good place.

34:51.633 --> 34:53.468
You like mushroom stew?

34:53.468 --> 34:55.095
Alright, well, then tomorrow.

34:57.222 --> 34:58.265
Good.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.686
Don't fuck up, Paul.

35:03.729 --> 35:06.064
You, come on,
leave the girl alone.

35:15.532 --> 35:17.242
I don't like coming here,

35:17.242 --> 35:19.661
with Interpol watching
and everything.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.830
How are we gonna know
who they're watching?

35:21.830 --> 35:25.042
Yeah, but still,
puts you at risk.

35:25.042 --> 35:28.003
-That's why I have you.
-I guess.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.549
Did you get her number?

35:32.549 --> 35:34.384
Yeah. You want it?

35:48.023 --> 35:50.275
Take me back to the Reineart.

36:37.239 --> 36:38.699
What are you making?

36:39.491 --> 36:41.118
A doghouse?

36:41.118 --> 36:42.870
-A tree house?
-Hm-mm.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.663
A monkey house?

36:45.873 --> 36:47.583
-No.
-Can I help?

36:47.583 --> 36:49.668
Not until you do your homework.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.341
Hi.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.761
-What are you doing?
-Keeping my hands busy.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.346
I don't like sitting still.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.599
Gotta keep moving.

37:03.599 --> 37:06.268
You need to keep busy
or to keep moving?

37:06.268 --> 37:08.645
Because, you know,
it's not the same thing.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.317
-Yeah.
-Hey.

37:13.317 --> 37:15.944
It's okay to slow down
once in a while.

37:15.944 --> 37:18.488
And this is a place
as good as any.

37:22.951 --> 37:25.287
You know what? Let's go out.

37:25.287 --> 37:26.371
Come.

37:30.459 --> 37:33.337
Hey, Matteo?

37:36.507 --> 37:37.758
Beautiful, huh?

37:41.261 --> 37:42.346
Yeah.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.766
"Remember death."

37:46.558 --> 37:49.061
I remember when you guys
got those.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.396
You thought you were so badass.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.774
Don't you think
it's kind of morbid?

37:56.276 --> 37:58.028
Why not "remember life"?

37:59.279 --> 38:00.531
Yeah.

38:02.324 --> 38:05.494
Come.
Don't be afraid, silly cat.

38:08.539 --> 38:12.125
Hey, welcome. Have a seat.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.807
Whoo!

38:32.855 --> 38:34.815
Look at your mom.

38:35.732 --> 38:38.819
Hi, Mommy.

38:49.079 --> 38:52.374
Earth to Moonbase 2, hello?
Anyone?

38:52.374 --> 38:53.458
What?

38:54.751 --> 38:58.255
You've been in your own world
since you got home.

38:58.255 --> 39:00.632
You didn't hear a thing
Angie told you about her day.

39:00.632 --> 39:03.510
-I heard her.
-But you weren't listening.

39:04.636 --> 39:06.054
She's a smart kid, Paul.

39:06.054 --> 39:08.390
She knows when you're not
paying attention.

39:08.390 --> 39:11.727
Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh...

39:11.727 --> 39:14.521
But I've been trying
to figure out

39:14.521 --> 39:17.691
this accounting error at work.
You know how I get.

39:17.691 --> 39:20.652
Oh, yeah. All Beautiful Mind.

39:20.652 --> 39:22.529
Hey, you wanna talk about it?

39:23.697 --> 39:26.700
You wanna talk about
liabilities and equity with me?

39:26.700 --> 39:29.745
Mmm... Not if I don't have to.

39:29.745 --> 39:32.206
Aww...

40:19.962 --> 40:22.172
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

40:22.172 --> 40:25.467
to this beautiful tour
through Amsterdam.

40:25.467 --> 40:28.512
Also called
"the Venice of the North,"

40:28.512 --> 40:34.810
where we have 165 canals
and 1,281 bridges.

40:36.937 --> 40:40.899
The Magere Brug is one of
our oldest, first built in 1691

40:40.899 --> 40:44.319
where two sisters lived
on opposite banks.

40:44.319 --> 40:47.281
This can be seen
on your left-hand side.

40:48.198 --> 40:50.576
After this bridge,
on your right,

40:50.576 --> 40:53.871
we have the famous...

41:06.008 --> 41:08.177
Oh my God!

41:08.177 --> 41:12.347
So, I guess we can
continue our business then.

41:12.347 --> 41:13.765
Yes, Mr Nay.

41:25.861 --> 41:27.696
Tell me something.
What do we know?

41:27.696 --> 41:29.114
Not much.

41:30.741 --> 41:33.577
-Did he flip Paul?
-He couldn't say.

41:34.620 --> 41:39.041
My money, Interpol,
a fucking rat.

41:39.041 --> 41:40.959
No way it's a coincidence.

41:40.959 --> 41:43.754
Maybe next time
don't cut out his tongue

41:43.754 --> 41:46.882
before he's done
answering my questions.

41:46.882 --> 41:48.592
You crazy fuck.

41:49.635 --> 41:51.637
You think that's funny?

41:51.637 --> 41:53.347
Don't make faces.

41:55.474 --> 41:57.226
Goddammit.

41:57.226 --> 41:59.228
I need my fucking pills.

41:59.228 --> 42:02.481
Sorry,
people, the bridge is closed.

42:02.481 --> 42:04.483
Sorry, guys,
the bridge is closed.

42:06.610 --> 42:08.570
What the hell.

42:09.613 --> 42:10.697
It's Roman.

42:12.658 --> 42:15.285
Yes, I see that.

42:22.459 --> 42:24.378
Bye, Daisy!

43:08.589 --> 43:13.218
It looks to be a bad day for a
new crypto-currency, Taltos.
At...

43:19.474 --> 43:22.769
Gabriel, I was just about
to call you.

43:22.769 --> 43:25.272
I need some good news, Paul.

43:25.272 --> 43:27.983
I'm having a very,
very stressful day.

43:27.983 --> 43:29.818
In fact, my doctor
standing in front of me

43:29.818 --> 43:32.738
tells me I have too much
anxiety, I need to relax.

43:32.738 --> 43:35.407
Actually, there has been
another complication.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.785
No! No, no, no, no, no.
There's no complication.

43:38.785 --> 43:40.996
There can't be,
because yesterday in your office

43:40.996 --> 43:43.999
you told me
you'd have my money today.

43:43.999 --> 43:45.834
You remember this, yes?

43:45.834 --> 43:47.503
Of course I remember.

43:47.503 --> 43:50.672
But it's proven to be a bit more
of a problem than I thought.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.136
Saban, you're there?
You still there?

43:56.136 --> 43:59.264
No, Paul, you did not lose me.

43:59.264 --> 44:01.016
I wanna know where the fuck
my money is

44:01.016 --> 44:02.935
that you're supposed to be
watching over.

44:03.727 --> 44:06.146
-You just got to trust me.
-Trust you?

44:06.146 --> 44:09.399
"Trust me" is what people say
before they sneak up behind you

44:09.399 --> 44:12.027
and they cut
your fucking throat.

44:12.027 --> 44:14.446
That's a lonely way to live.

44:14.446 --> 44:17.533
It's the only way
I live. Do you know why, Paul?

44:17.533 --> 44:20.953
Because betrayal
is around every corner, Paul.

44:20.953 --> 44:23.330
It's in every shadow.

44:23.330 --> 44:26.834
Find my money.

44:26.834 --> 44:29.169
Gabriel, I can fix this.

44:29.169 --> 44:31.380
I just need more time. Okay?

44:44.059 --> 44:46.395
Hey, come with me.

44:48.272 --> 44:50.440
-What's up?
-We have to visit a friend.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.525
Alright.

44:54.278 --> 44:55.779
...second quarter.

44:55.779 --> 44:58.782
I'd love to call what's
happening to Taltos a rug pull,

44:58.782 --> 45:01.785
but the market looks to pick up
over the next few months.

45:01.785 --> 45:04.204
-I don't have months.
-The summer, however,

45:04.204 --> 45:07.708
has been cruel to the whole
crypto market. By extension,

45:07.708 --> 45:10.711
the crypto-currencies have
also been severely impacted.

45:13.422 --> 45:16.008
You think
Saban's sending us a message?

45:17.134 --> 45:19.595
No, what makes you say that?

45:20.762 --> 45:22.347
Well...

45:22.347 --> 45:26.059
First, hanging the body here,
in a public place. And second...

45:27.394 --> 45:28.604
You're fucking with me.

45:28.604 --> 45:31.023
Of course it's a message,
you jackass.

45:31.023 --> 45:33.859
Or he would have stuffed him
in a barrel of concrete

45:33.859 --> 45:35.485
and dumped him off a boat.

45:46.747 --> 45:48.790
Hey, stop!

45:48.790 --> 45:50.792
Stop. Stop.

45:50.792 --> 45:51.919
Open it.

45:54.505 --> 45:58.300
Come on, come on.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.469
Fuck.

46:01.470 --> 46:03.889
Well, at least we know it works.

46:03.889 --> 46:07.226
Let's go back to the office.
Naomi in Cyber owes me a favor.

46:07.226 --> 46:10.062
Ooh, Naomi. She still single?

46:11.480 --> 46:15.275
What? Are you jealous?

46:20.322 --> 46:22.449
Did you get stung by a bee?

46:23.200 --> 46:24.284
No.

46:26.078 --> 46:27.996
This is just my body.

46:27.996 --> 46:29.289
But does that hurt?

46:34.461 --> 46:35.671
Sometimes.

46:37.798 --> 46:39.800
I need to tell you a secret.

46:59.862 --> 47:01.405
Hey.

47:01.405 --> 47:02.990
Hey. Hey, uhm,

47:02.990 --> 47:05.701
I need to sweet-talk
some investors tonight

47:05.701 --> 47:07.369
so I don't know
how late I'll be.

47:07.369 --> 47:09.204
You know
it's pizza night, right?

47:09.204 --> 47:12.040
Yeah, I know. I know.
Uh, save me a slice.

47:13.041 --> 47:15.502
Okay. Bye.

47:25.053 --> 47:27.222
Come on. Come on, come on.

47:28.390 --> 47:30.642
It's Roman. Leave a message.

47:31.685 --> 47:34.605
It's Paul Woodley here. Uhm...

47:34.605 --> 47:36.148
I'm ready to deal.

47:47.242 --> 47:48.869
I have something for you.

47:52.539 --> 47:54.499
Do you like it?

47:54.499 --> 47:57.044
Yeah, I love it.

48:02.424 --> 48:05.511
I know you're probably ready
to get moving again, but...

48:06.553 --> 48:08.514
stick around, okay?

48:09.431 --> 48:12.434
I think John would want you
to get to know his daughter.

48:14.728 --> 48:17.564
Pretty face.

48:17.564 --> 48:20.359
Mommy,
can I have a slice right now?

48:20.359 --> 48:22.611
Yes, of course.
But watch the road.

48:22.611 --> 48:25.113
I'm just like Matteo.

48:27.449 --> 48:30.786
Oooh...

48:32.579 --> 48:36.208
Look at this goon.
As big as an ox.

48:37.167 --> 48:38.293
Break him.

48:40.337 --> 48:42.339
-Matteo!
-No!

48:42.339 --> 48:43.924
Don't hurt him!

48:45.050 --> 48:47.344
-Stop!
-Angie! No!

48:49.721 --> 48:52.099
Angie, into the car. Quick.

48:53.350 --> 48:54.852
Bitch.

48:54.852 --> 48:56.812
-Mom! Mommy!
-Fucker!

48:56.812 --> 48:58.480
-Get in the car.
-Let me go!

48:58.480 --> 49:01.733
-Zeeb, come on!
-See you around, ox.

49:01.733 --> 49:04.486
Matteo, she's in the car!

49:04.486 --> 49:06.446
-Go, go, go!
-Matteo!

49:06.446 --> 49:10.117
Oh, fuck. Give me your phone.
Give me your phone!

49:10.117 --> 49:11.827
Hey, that's my bike.

49:11.827 --> 49:13.620
Give me your phone!

49:13.620 --> 49:15.330
Hey, that's my phone!

49:21.420 --> 49:23.922
-Yeah, hello?
-They took Angie.

49:23.922 --> 49:26.633
Hey, okay, slow down, slow down.
Where are you?

49:26.633 --> 49:28.677
I don't know. They took her.

49:28.677 --> 49:30.637
-Paul, they took Angie.
-I'm on my way.

49:31.430 --> 49:33.265
Son of a bitch!

49:33.265 --> 49:35.309
Matteo, help me!

49:43.692 --> 49:46.862
Goddammit!

49:55.662 --> 49:57.164
We have to split up.

49:57.164 --> 49:59.124
Move!

50:05.047 --> 50:08.509
Hello, Gabriel.
I told you I needed some time.

50:08.509 --> 50:12.679
I told you, Paul.
I don't like complications.

50:12.679 --> 50:15.265
You better let her go,
you son of a...

50:16.892 --> 50:19.186
Ah, goddammit!

50:27.277 --> 50:30.405
Mommy.

50:30.405 --> 50:32.616
Hey. Shut up.

50:37.746 --> 50:39.122
Aw shit, there he is.

50:41.124 --> 50:42.376
Who the heck is this guy?

50:44.503 --> 50:47.047
Get him off. Get him off!

50:50.801 --> 50:54.221
Where's the girl?

51:08.777 --> 51:11.655
Good job.

51:11.655 --> 51:14.491
Come on.

51:14.491 --> 51:16.994
Why are you still
doing this, old man?

51:16.994 --> 51:18.495
You calling me old?

51:18.495 --> 51:22.583
I'm talking about this.
This life. You got a wife.

51:22.583 --> 51:24.418
A kid on the way.

51:26.461 --> 51:28.714
Enough, enough.

51:30.257 --> 51:33.051
No, seriously.

51:33.969 --> 51:35.429
I know what you mean.

51:38.724 --> 51:40.434
Listen, we're family.

51:41.685 --> 51:43.270
You, me, Helene.

51:44.438 --> 51:45.939
And that kid, man.

51:46.857 --> 51:49.610
It's scaring the shit out of me
how soon it's gonna be here.

51:49.610 --> 51:51.028
You're gonna be a dad.

51:51.862 --> 51:54.406
Anyways, we're family.

51:55.741 --> 51:57.284
So are they.

51:58.827 --> 52:00.996
And they're family too.

52:00.996 --> 52:03.123
And we are all each other's got.

52:03.123 --> 52:06.335
And we are all that stands
between war and home.

52:06.335 --> 52:08.045
It's us.

52:08.045 --> 52:09.546
Yes, sir.

52:09.546 --> 52:11.173
And that's noble.

52:27.147 --> 52:28.941
I have to question him.

52:28.941 --> 52:30.776
When he wakes up.

52:30.776 --> 52:33.529
Why aren't you out there
trying to find my baby girl?

52:33.529 --> 52:35.906
-They're trying their best.
-Are you?

52:35.906 --> 52:37.324
We've got this.

52:37.324 --> 52:39.201
Agent Brasel, agent Fischer,
Interpol.

52:39.201 --> 52:42.204
-I have to call my captain.
-She already knows.

52:42.204 --> 52:43.497
Ms Woodley,

52:43.497 --> 52:45.707
getting your daughter back
is our top priority.

52:45.707 --> 52:47.543
We're setting up checkpoints
all across the city.

52:47.543 --> 52:49.545
A scooter won't get through
without us searching it.

52:49.545 --> 52:51.630
But I do need to ask him
some questions.

52:51.630 --> 52:53.507
Wait. Wait!

53:03.058 --> 53:05.227
Think I could get
some clothes on first?

53:06.061 --> 53:08.146
You got somewhere
you need to be?

53:10.899 --> 53:12.150
Yeah.

53:13.485 --> 53:15.070
Gotta get Angie back.

53:16.363 --> 53:18.448
How are you gonna do that?

53:18.448 --> 53:22.077
I'll start by doing your job and
find the people who took her.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.749
Those two guys
you turned into headstones

53:27.749 --> 53:29.668
were both Consociation.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.591
You thought this had
something to do with me.

53:35.591 --> 53:37.843
You're the unknown factor.

53:37.843 --> 53:40.888
No driver's license,
no home address, no cellphone,

53:40.888 --> 53:43.098
no bank accounts,
no fingerprints on file,

53:43.098 --> 53:48.312
not even a file really.
Except a name. Matteo Donner.

53:48.312 --> 53:51.940
And some redacted military
service. Nothing but a passport.

53:53.775 --> 53:55.569
What's the Consociation?

53:59.239 --> 54:01.491
It's like the NATO
of organized crime.

54:01.491 --> 54:03.869
An international alliance
of extortionists,

54:03.869 --> 54:06.496
murderers, counterfeiters,
you name it.

54:06.496 --> 54:09.750
And when you attack one,
you attack all of them.

54:09.750 --> 54:12.711
The branch that took Angie
is run by Gabriel Saban.

54:12.711 --> 54:16.798
What do they want?
Money?

54:16.798 --> 54:20.802
We're not sure.
This isn't their usual MO.

54:20.802 --> 54:24.014
Jesus, what is their usual MO?

54:24.014 --> 54:25.599
Young girls no one will miss.

54:27.059 --> 54:29.686
Snatch them off the streets,
drug them,

54:29.686 --> 54:32.147
ship them all over the world.

54:32.147 --> 54:34.316
But never a girl
as young as Angie.

54:34.316 --> 54:36.902
Not in this city
and certainly not so loud.

54:37.986 --> 54:39.446
So it's personal.

54:40.572 --> 54:42.115
You tell me.

54:45.410 --> 54:46.787
I don't know these guys.

54:50.541 --> 54:53.293
But I'll go make
some introductions.

54:53.293 --> 54:55.546
Keep talking like that and
we'll see if these still fit.

54:55.546 --> 54:57.673
Calm down, big guy,
we all want the same thing.

54:57.673 --> 55:01.510
So let us do our jobs.
You've created enough of a mess.

55:02.678 --> 55:07.015
But if any of you know anything,
now is the time to say so.

55:07.015 --> 55:10.435
We're monitoring your home,
phones, internet.

55:10.435 --> 55:12.312
We'll know if they make contact.

55:12.312 --> 55:15.232
What are we supposed to do,
just sit around and wait?

55:15.232 --> 55:17.234
Listen, I know this is hard,

55:17.234 --> 55:19.862
but I need you to trust us
and stay calm.

55:19.862 --> 55:22.698
How can I be calm, knowing
my little girl is out there

55:22.698 --> 55:24.616
terrified and alone? How?

55:24.616 --> 55:26.159
-Come on.
-Tell me.

55:26.159 --> 55:28.996
Come on, let's go home.
There's nothing we can do here.

55:28.996 --> 55:31.248
Calm down. It'll be okay.

55:31.248 --> 55:34.209
So you can reach her when you're
about to do something stupid.

55:37.963 --> 55:39.339
Thank you.

55:46.513 --> 55:50.726
This is all connected, isn't it?
Roman, Saban, the girl.

55:50.726 --> 55:54.396
I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

55:56.023 --> 55:58.233
Letting him walk out of here
is like...

55:58.233 --> 56:00.235
putting a wildcat in your pants.

56:14.416 --> 56:15.667
Bye.

56:24.092 --> 56:25.093
Hi.

56:27.429 --> 56:29.139
What do you say
when someone says hello?

56:29.139 --> 56:31.767
Ber.

56:31.767 --> 56:34.561
Are you scared of that big guy?
I am.

56:35.312 --> 56:36.522
I'm Gabriel.

56:37.523 --> 56:39.525
I know you're afraid,
but you don't have to be.

56:39.525 --> 56:41.944
You're gonna go home
really soon, okay?

56:41.944 --> 56:43.028
Okay?

56:48.325 --> 56:49.660
Talk.

56:49.660 --> 56:51.620
Lo said that Interpol
was at the hospital,

56:51.620 --> 56:54.540
but the Woodley's didn't go
with them.

56:54.540 --> 56:56.959
I don't think Paul
told them anything.

56:56.959 --> 56:58.001
Okay, good.

56:58.794 --> 57:01.797
The Consociation wants the
Sindikheth's access to Thailand.

57:01.797 --> 57:03.632
We cannot lose that,
do you understand?

57:03.632 --> 57:05.676
I wanna go home.

57:05.676 --> 57:07.803
What am I gonna do
with this kid?

57:07.803 --> 57:09.054
I don't know.

57:09.054 --> 57:11.807
Maybe we can give her
to the Thais.

57:11.807 --> 57:15.352
Ber, what's wrong with you?

57:16.395 --> 57:17.980
It's actually not a bad idea.

57:17.980 --> 57:20.148
They like that kind of thing
over there.

57:22.484 --> 57:24.736
Do you want some juice,
sweetheart?

57:26.697 --> 57:28.448
A little juice?

57:38.834 --> 57:41.587
We've been talking about
that we wanted to ask you

57:41.587 --> 57:45.048
if you wanna be
our daughter's godfather.

57:45.716 --> 57:47.009
Are you serious?

57:47.009 --> 57:49.344
It means,
if something happens to me,

57:49.344 --> 57:51.722
then you're gonna watch
over her.

57:54.516 --> 57:56.351
I'd be honored.

57:56.351 --> 58:00.147
That's good, because, uh,
everybody else I asked said no.

58:02.524 --> 58:03.734
We're family.

58:08.238 --> 58:09.448
Here.

58:11.074 --> 58:14.786
-This will help you calm down.
-I don't want to calm down.

58:14.786 --> 58:16.455
-Drink some water.
-No.

58:22.711 --> 58:24.838
-Do you know the combination?
-What are you doing?

58:24.838 --> 58:27.841
There's only one way
to get Angie back alive.

58:27.841 --> 58:31.053
-I have to go get her.
-What do you mean, go get her?

58:31.053 --> 58:34.056
Six twelve, it's six twelve.
It's her birthday.

58:34.056 --> 58:36.558
Hey. Hey, whoa whoa whoa.

58:36.558 --> 58:38.769
You heard
what that Interpol agent said.

58:38.769 --> 58:41.438
She said Saban's got men
everywhere. Right?

58:41.438 --> 58:43.899
He's like this Eurotrash
fucking Tony Montana

58:43.899 --> 58:46.652
who's in bed with one of the
most ruthless gangs in Thailand.

58:46.652 --> 58:48.946
And if you attack one of them,
you attack them all.

58:48.946 --> 58:50.822
They're gonna kill us,
our friends,

58:50.822 --> 58:53.158
everyone we know.
Everyone we know!

58:53.158 --> 58:55.410
How do you know
he's connected to the Thai?

58:57.037 --> 58:58.247
The agent.

58:58.247 --> 59:00.832
She called it
the NATO of organized crime.

59:00.832 --> 59:03.168
She didn't say anything
about the Thai.

59:03.168 --> 59:05.254
I don't know, man.
You've got a concussion.

59:05.254 --> 59:07.840
-What's going on?
-He knows who took Angie.

59:07.840 --> 59:11.343
-What?
-Why didn't they ask for ransom?

59:11.343 --> 59:12.928
-How the hell should I know?
-Where is she?

59:12.928 --> 59:14.513
-I don't know!
-Stop!

59:14.513 --> 59:16.139
Stop!

59:16.139 --> 59:18.392
Where is she?! Where is she?!

59:18.392 --> 59:22.521
Okay, okay, okay. It's my fault.
It's my fault.

59:22.521 --> 59:23.981
You knew?

59:24.648 --> 59:26.233
Where is she?!

59:26.233 --> 59:28.485
I don't know.
I swear to Christ, I don't know.

59:28.485 --> 59:30.112
Why did they take her?!

59:30.112 --> 59:32.865
'Cause I took their money
and now they want it back.

59:32.865 --> 59:34.616
-Give it back to them!
-I don't have it.

59:34.616 --> 59:36.618
-How much?!
-15 million euros.

59:36.618 --> 59:38.620
So we just let them take her?

59:38.620 --> 59:41.248
You can't go to war
with these guys, you can't.

59:41.248 --> 59:43.959
Well, actually, I can.

59:45.627 --> 59:49.715
Helene, I'm so sorry.
Helene, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

59:58.473 --> 01:00:00.517
Oh, shit.

01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:04.104
Call Saban. Tell him
you have the money,

01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:06.523
and make sure he believes you.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:10.068
I'm sure you can understand
my hesitation, Paul.

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:13.989
Explain to me again how you
managed to pull this off.

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:17.826
I've been skimming off
my other clients for years

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:21.955
and I've kept a lot of it
liquidated.

01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:26.877
I just want Angie back, Gabriel.
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:29.213
How much? Huh?

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.090
How much have you taken
from assholes like me

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.675
who trusted you?

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.469
More than I ever needed.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:39.181
You're gonna bring it to me.
All of it.

01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:43.936
And, Paul, if you lie to me,
you try to fuck me,

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:46.647
I will kill everything you love.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:49.233
Slow.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.610
Do you understand?

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:53.612
Bring it to me.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.448
Okay, I will.

01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:07.042
There's a construction site
in Westpoort.

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:10.212
You're gonna meet Saban's men
there for the exchange.

01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:23.225
I just made a...

01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:25.269
...bad bet.

01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:30.232
-It's just bad luck.
-Bad luck?

01:01:41.952 --> 01:01:43.412
He's lying.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.498
No shit.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:50.377
That's why you're gonna put
an end to this mess, now.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.180
It won't be so bad.

01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:05.392
You see, I was an orphan once.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:08.604
Look how strong it made me.

01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:23.118
Please, bring her home.

01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:25.996
I'm gonna kill them all.

01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:35.297
Yeah?

01:02:35.297 --> 01:02:39.009
Naomi was able to get into
Roman's phone. Listen to this.

01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:42.387
It's Paul
Woodley here. I'm ready to deal.

01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:45.390
But I want immunity
and protection for my family.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.643
-I'll give you anything...
-Son of a bitch.

01:02:47.643 --> 01:02:49.811
Don't let him leave that house.

01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.104
I'm on it.

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:54.900
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to call you back.

01:02:58.403 --> 01:02:59.655
Out.

01:03:03.784 --> 01:03:06.036
God... Fuck.

01:03:06.036 --> 01:03:07.454
Agent Fischer?

01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.248
Want some coffee?

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.084
Come in.

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:18.298
Is your husband home?

01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:21.385
Are you going to arrest him?

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:26.640
He's upstairs.

01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:31.979
Mr Woodley?

01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:35.858
Can you come
down here please?

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.321
Yeah. Just a second.

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.430
What's gonna happen to him?

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:12.186
Depends on what he knew.
And when he knew it.

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:22.237
Is that decaf?

01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:45.552
Holy shit. It's the ox.

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:51.391
That was a real dick move
you did to my guys.

01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.769
The risks
of being a soldier, eh?

01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.771
You're not a soldier.

01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:58.941
No? Tomato, to-mah-to. Whatever.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.486
-Is that the money?
-The money's here.

01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:04.530
Where's Angie?

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.533
-Mm? Who's Angie?
-The girl.

01:05:07.533 --> 01:05:10.369
We're supposed to make a trade.
The money for her.

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:13.956
I don't know anything
about a trade.

01:05:13.956 --> 01:05:16.792
Whoa whoa whoa.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:18.627
We didn't bring her.

01:05:21.797 --> 01:05:25.968
The deal was, you bring us the
money and the girl doesn't die.

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.678
You brought us the money

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.431
and you have our word
she's not gonna die.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.686
Now you know how we do deals.

01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:42.818
What? You wanna do something?
Huh?

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.362
Look at the ox.

01:05:45.362 --> 01:05:48.156
Comes here, thinking
he's gonna do something.

01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:51.577
But he sees all
of us and knows...

01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:54.538
he's no hero.

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.004
Yeah.

01:06:02.004 --> 01:06:04.298
See you in the next life, ox.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.553
What happens to Angie?

01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:15.392
Some lucky prince is gonna
make her a happy princess.

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:18.520
Kill him.

01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.700
Shit.

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:25.003
Mr Woodley? Mr Woodley?

01:07:25.003 --> 01:07:28.257
I really need you
to come down now. We gotta...

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:38.225
Easy.

01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:40.769
Easy.

01:07:44.982 --> 01:07:46.191
Let her go.

01:07:55.993 --> 01:07:57.202
Son of a bitch!

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.712
Wanna play, motherfucker?

01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.757
Let's play.

01:08:26.565 --> 01:08:28.150
Hello, we need an ambulance.

01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:31.612
There's an officer down.
Please, hurry! Hurry, please!

01:08:33.155 --> 01:08:35.824
Paul, where are you?!

01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:36.950
Paul?!

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.827
Ready to be a hero?

01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:41.330
You think you scare me?
You don't fucking scare me.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:46.168
Stop moving.

01:08:46.168 --> 01:08:48.003
This doesn't mean shit.

01:08:48.003 --> 01:08:51.924
We'll find you and
we'll cut your fucking head off.

01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.509
And that little bitch.

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:58.055
We'll send her somewhere
they use girls like Kleenex.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:02.893
I didn't move.

01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:05.479
I know. But you were talking.

01:09:08.690 --> 01:09:12.027
I know what this is.

01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:13.946
It's some stupid theater.

01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:28.252
Stop. Stop!

01:09:28.252 --> 01:09:29.795
Stop!

01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:43.976
I'm only gonna ask once.
Where's the girl?

01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:50.941
Fuck you.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:54.236
Okay.

01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:07.291
She's at the Reinaert!
She's at the Reinaert!

01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:19.469
She's at the Reinaert,
in the Red Light District.

01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:24.892
See? You can be a hero.

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:26.768
But it's not gonna save you.

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:38.071
Hold this here. Press.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.448
Paul!

01:10:40.574 --> 01:10:42.367
Okay, breathe. Look at me.

01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:44.661
Look at me.

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:48.832
Give me a hand.

01:10:52.127 --> 01:10:54.588
Mr... Mr Woodley.

01:10:56.298 --> 01:10:57.841
You're under arrest.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:02.262
-Give me a hand, please!
-No, I, uh...

01:11:03.847 --> 01:11:05.432
I'm sorry.

01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:08.310
You son of a bitch.

01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:14.233
He's a bit
of an asshole, isn't he?

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:37.422
Listen.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:40.008
I don't know
what they're paying you,

01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:42.845
but I have a lot of money
in that bag and I can get more.

01:11:42.845 --> 01:11:44.137
Enough for both of us, man.

01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:56.024
Fischer.

01:11:57.276 --> 01:11:58.610
Fischer.

01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:06.535
-Oh my God.
-The ambulance is on the way.

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:09.496
Oh my God. You, idiot.

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.916
If you die, I'll kill you.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:15.169
You think I'm gonna get a medal?

01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:16.920
Yes.

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:33.896
Yes?

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:35.397
Angie is at the club Reineart.

01:12:35.397 --> 01:12:37.107
Donner, I told you
to stand down.

01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:38.692
Bring backup.

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:40.569
Donner?

01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:48.410
-Please stay with him.
-Okay. Where are you going?

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:49.870
To do something stupid.

01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:08.972
They're not answering.

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:12.893
They're probably all dead.

01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:15.103
Yeah.

01:13:28.825 --> 01:13:30.410
That's it?

01:13:32.663 --> 01:13:34.414
Get that thing
off my fucking desk.

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.052
Hi, sweetie.

01:13:47.803 --> 01:13:52.015
Oh... I'm gonna sit
right next to you, sweetheart.

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:59.398
You know, your friend,
the big, big guy.

01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:01.525
-What's his name?
-Matteo.

01:14:01.525 --> 01:14:05.279
Matteo. That's a cool name.

01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:09.324
And Matteo,
he's friends with your dad?

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:12.828
Not Paul, but my real dad.

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:15.205
Oh, your real dad.

01:14:15.998 --> 01:14:17.332
Mmm.

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:21.837
Do you think he's gonna
come here and come get you?

01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:23.714
-Yeah.
-You do?

01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:28.385
I've seen this man, boss.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.512
I don't think
he gives up easily.

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.847
Mmm.

01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:36.602
Okay. Well, then I guess
we should let him come, huh?

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.521
Matteo?

01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:40.981
Yeah.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:58.332
Do you have a reservation?

01:15:24.775 --> 01:15:26.902
You're not going up, my friend.

01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:30.239
You want a girl,
all you need to do is ask.

01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:32.658
I'm not looking
for one of these girls.

01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.910
Tell your boss I'm here
to see him.

01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:39.831
All you're gonna see
is the inside of a coffin.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:48.131
-Last chance.
-Seriously, huh?

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.737
Move it. Move it!

01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.574
Out of my way.

01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:17.995
You keep her quiet now.

01:16:41.226 --> 01:16:42.728
Take him down.
Take him down.

01:16:48.525 --> 01:16:51.904
I thought
you were gonna bring backup.

01:16:51.904 --> 01:16:54.781
I am the backup.

01:17:08.712 --> 01:17:10.005
We have to leave now.

01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:12.341
-Come on. Go, go, go, go.
-No! No!

01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:14.009
-Come.
-Let me go!

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:16.345
-I go too. Please.
-Hey!

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:18.430
-Don't hurt her!
-Easy.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:49.545
You good?

01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:52.756
Fuck, yeah.

01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:01.431
Put an end to this. Now.

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:04.476
See you later.

01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:10.899
-Where's the girl?!
-That way. To the roof.

01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:13.193
They went to the roof.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.289
Where are you taking me?

01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:26.999
Shut up.

01:18:29.168 --> 01:18:30.627
I don't wanna go.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:35.048
What did I tell you?
Shut up and keep moving.

01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:49.646
I don't think so.

01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:16.089
-No.
-Come, come.

01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:18.675
-I don't want to.
-Come!

01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:26.391
Come on!

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:02.469
-No, I hate you.
-Come. Come.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:05.055
-No!
-Come! Come!

01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:52.120
Don't follow me.

01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:54.623
Well, you got my number.

01:21:56.792 --> 01:22:01.004
You motherfuckers.

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:07.261
Hey. Stop.

01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:12.975
Where do you think you're going?

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:15.644
Huh?

01:22:16.478 --> 01:22:19.815
Behave yourself. You got that?

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:23.277
Saban!

01:22:23.861 --> 01:22:25.279
No!

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.492
-I'll kill her.
-Give me the girl.

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:31.910
Don't be stupid.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:37.124
Just give me the girl
and I'll let you walk away.

01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:39.459
You'll let me walk away?

01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:41.920
That's a knife. That's a gun.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.507
Come any closer and I'll blow
her fucking brains out,

01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:48.510
-I swear to God.
-Give me the girl.

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:36.517
Matteo! Are you okay?

01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:40.270
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:23:42.231 --> 01:23:44.358
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:49.530
Thank you.

01:23:51.198 --> 01:23:53.700
-Let's go home.
-Yeah.

01:24:17.975 --> 01:24:20.269
Daisy, let's play.

01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:22.312
You're so cute.

01:24:26.942 --> 01:24:29.069
I'm gonna get you a pillow.

01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:40.247
Do you think
Matteo will come back?

01:24:40.247 --> 01:24:42.332
Yeah, I think so, honey.

01:24:43.584 --> 01:24:44.918
I like that.

01:24:50.966 --> 01:24:53.343
Good girl. Yes.

01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:55.596
Oh.

01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:05.350
You happy now?

01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:11.064
Now get your ass up.
We got work to do.
