00:33.233 --> 00:34.401
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.467 --> 00:35.168
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.235 --> 00:35.969
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.035 --> 00:39.606
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.672 --> 00:40.473
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK,

00:40.540 --> 00:41.808
INCLUDING, LEAST IMPORTANTLY,

00:41.875 --> 00:42.776
THE QUEEN'S PLATINUM JUBILEE,

00:42.842 --> 00:46.146
MARKING HER 70 YEARS ON THE

00:46.212 --> 00:46.780
THRONE, WHICH FEATURED THE ROYAL

00:46.846 --> 00:47.614
FAMILY APPEARING ON THE BALCONY

00:47.680 --> 00:49.916
OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE, MULTIPLE

CORGIS, AND ONE SCHOOL DOING

00:54.521 --> 00:56.623
WHATEVER THE FUCK THIS ABSOLUTE

00:56.689 --> 00:59.225
LIVING NIGHTMARE IS.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.427
IT WAS BASICALLY A FOUR-DAY

01:00.493 --> 01:01.895
CELEBRATION OF EVERYTHING THE

01:01.961 --> 01:03.530
QUEEN LOVES, WITH ONE KEY

01:03.596 --> 01:04.664
EXCEPTION.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.332
>> IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO

01:06.399 --> 01:07.467
THIS, THE QUESTION WAS WHAT TO

01:07.534 --> 01:08.768
DO WITH A PROBLEM LIKE ANDREW?

01:08.835 --> 01:10.203
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S TAKEN

01:10.270 --> 01:11.137
CARE OF ITSELF BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:11.204 --> 01:12.472
THE NEWS THAT HE TESTED COVID

01:12.539 --> 01:13.907
POSITIVE.

01:13.973 --> 01:16.009
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

01:16.075 --> 01:17.644
QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF THAT

01:17.710 --> 01:19.179
'CAUSE IT'S VERY CONVENIENT.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.614
>> WELL, HE DID TEST POSITIVE,

01:21.681 --> 01:22.449
THEY SAID, SO HE MUST HAVE

01:22.515 --> 01:24.250
A CERTIFICATE.

01:24.317 --> 01:24.918
>> DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL

01:24.984 --> 01:26.853
DEMAND TO SEE THAT CERTIFICATE?

01:26.920 --> 01:27.987
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING

01:28.054 --> 01:29.589
TO GET TO SEE IT.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.590
>> John: YEAH, I DON'T THINK

01:30.657 --> 01:31.858
THEY WILL EITHER.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.926
IN FACT, BASED ON WHAT GENERALLY

01:32.992 --> 01:34.694
HAPPENS TO INFORMATION ABOUT

01:34.761 --> 01:35.929
PRINCE ANDREW, THAT COVID TEST

01:35.995 --> 01:36.830
WILL PROBABLY CONVENIENTLY

01:36.896 --> 01:38.631
COMMIT SUICIDE IN PRISON.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.533
OR YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:40.600 --> 01:41.367
MAYBE HE'LL PAY US ALL MILLIONS

01:41.434 --> 01:42.135
OF POUNDS TO STOP

01:42.202 --> 01:43.169
BRINGING IT UP.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.437
THOSE DO SEEM TO BE HIS TWO

01:44.504 --> 01:45.905
GO-TO MOVES.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.474
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

01:47.540 --> 01:48.408
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO START

01:48.475 --> 01:49.275
WITH OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

01:49.342 --> 01:51.377
WHICH CONCERNS WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:51.444 --> 01:53.513
UVALDE, TEXAS, 12 DAYS AGO,

01:53.580 --> 01:54.714
WHEN AN 18-YEAR-OLD ARMED

01:54.781 --> 01:56.716
WITH TWO AR-15s KILLED

01:56.783 --> 01:59.385
19 CHILDREN AND TWO TEACHERS

01:59.452 --> 02:01.054
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.922
AND LOOK, WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE

02:02.989 --> 02:04.357
KEY PROBLEM IS HERE.

02:04.424 --> 02:05.391
IT'S GUNS.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.759
IT'S BECAUSE WE LET BASICALLY

02:06.826 --> 02:08.228
WHOEVER WANTS TO BUY A GUN IN

02:08.294 --> 02:09.662
THIS COUNTRY HAVE ONE,

02:09.729 --> 02:10.864
WHICH HAS LED TO TRAGIC

02:10.930 --> 02:11.898
CONSEQUENCES.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.166
THE VAST MAJORITY OF MASS

02:13.233 --> 02:15.502
SHOOTERS, INCLUDING THE SHOOTERS

02:15.568 --> 02:18.204
AT UVALDE AND PARKLAND, OBTAINED

02:18.271 --> 02:19.172
THE WEAPONS THEY USED THROUGH

02:19.239 --> 02:21.508
LEGAL PURCHASES.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.809
SO WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO

02:22.876 --> 02:23.877
THIS PROBLEM IS, TOO.

02:23.943 --> 02:24.644
IT'S GUN CONTROL.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.713
IT'S MEANINGFUL, EFFECTIVE GUN

02:26.779 --> 02:27.780
LAWS.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.315
BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED SOME

02:29.382 --> 02:30.850
FROM DESPERATELY PITCHING

02:30.917 --> 02:32.585
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING OTHER THAN

02:32.652 --> 02:34.454
THAT AS A SOLUTION.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.155
>> THE ONLY SOLUTION IS CHRIST

02:36.222 --> 02:37.724
JESUS AND BEING ABLE TO GET SOME

02:37.790 --> 02:39.792
TYPE OF SPIRITUALITY AND PRAYER

02:39.859 --> 02:41.528
BACK INTO OUR SCHOOLS.

02:41.594 --> 02:42.128
>> MAN TRAPS.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.196
A SERIES OF INTERLOCKING DOORS

02:43.263 --> 02:44.831
AT THE SCHOOL ENTRANCE THAT ARE

02:44.898 --> 02:47.400
TRIGGERED BY A TRIPWIRE.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.968
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS,

02:49.035 --> 02:51.604
A NATIONAL PUSH TOWARDS, INSTEAD

02:51.671 --> 02:52.739
OF PARENTS BUYIN' THEIR KIDS ALL

02:52.805 --> 02:54.741
THESE TOOLS AND TOYS AND GAMES,

02:54.807 --> 02:55.775
INVEST IN THE CLASSROOM TO MAKE

02:55.842 --> 02:57.977
IT SAFER.

02:58.044 --> 02:58.912
I MEAN, THEY HAVE BLANKETS

02:58.978 --> 03:00.146
THAT YOU CAN PUT UP ON THE WALL

03:00.213 --> 03:00.980
THAT ARE COLORFUL AND BEAUTIFUL,

03:01.047 --> 03:03.783
BUT THEY'RE BALLISTIC BLANKETS.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.250
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU

03:04.317 --> 03:05.552
TALKING ABOUT?

03:05.618 --> 03:07.186
"USE A BLANKET" IS NOT A

03:07.253 --> 03:08.388
STRATEGY FOR STOPPING DEATHS

03:08.454 --> 03:10.590
DURING A SCHOOL SHOOTING.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.492
IT'S BARELY A STRATEGY FOR

03:12.559 --> 03:15.094
"A BIRD GOT IN THE HOUSE."

03:15.161 --> 03:16.496
AND WHILE THOSE IDEAS ARE

03:16.563 --> 03:18.197
CLEARLY RIDICULOUS, "HARDENING

03:18.264 --> 03:19.866
OUR SCHOOLS" SO OFTEN COMES UP

03:19.933 --> 03:20.433
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GUN

03:20.500 --> 03:21.935
CONTROL.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.736
AND AT THE NRA CONVENTION THAT

03:23.803 --> 03:26.272
INEXPLICABLY STILL TOOK PLACE IN

03:26.339 --> 03:31.311
TEXAS JUST THREE DAYS AFTER THE

03:31.377 --> 03:32.645
SHOOTING THERE, WAYNE LAPIERRE

03:32.712 --> 03:33.846
PITCHED THE EXACT SAME SOLUTION

03:33.913 --> 03:34.681
HE DID AFTER SANDY HOOK AND

03:34.747 --> 03:35.782
AFTER PARKLAND.

03:35.848 --> 03:36.583
>> WE ALSO NEED TO FULLY FUND

03:36.649 --> 03:39.085
OUR NATION'S POLICE DEPARTMENTS

03:39.152 --> 03:42.121
AND SCHOOL SECURITY RESOURCE

03:42.188 --> 03:44.324
OFFICER PROGRAMS.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.825
>> John: EXACTLY.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.695
PUT POLICE OR SCHOOL RESOURCE

03:48.761 --> 03:50.129
OFFICERS OR SROs, AS THEY'RE

03:50.196 --> 03:51.130
SOMETIMES CALLED, INTO SCHOOLS.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.498
AND I GUESS IT'S NOT THAT

03:52.565 --> 03:54.367
SURPRISING THAT THE SOLUTION

03:54.434 --> 03:55.902
FROM THE CEO OF THE NRA IS

03:55.969 --> 03:58.037
"MORE PEOPLE WITH GUNS."

03:58.104 --> 03:59.405
IT'D BE LIKE HEARING "THE

03:59.472 --> 04:00.907
GARBAGE DUMP IS OVERFLOWING, SO

04:00.974 --> 04:03.810
WE NEED MORE PILES OF GARBAGE"

04:03.876 --> 04:04.410
FROM THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL

04:04.477 --> 04:06.512
RACCOON ASSOCIATION.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.380
WHAT ELSE DO YOU REALLY EXPECT

04:07.447 --> 04:09.882
HIM TO SAY?

04:09.949 --> 04:12.018
BUT THE IDEA OF ADDING POLICE TO

04:12.085 --> 04:13.019
SCHOOLS DOES SEEM TO COME UP IN

04:13.086 --> 04:14.220
THE WAKE OF EVERY BIG SCHOOL

04:14.287 --> 04:15.588
SHOOTING.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.090
AND CRUCIALLY, IT'S THEN THE

04:17.156 --> 04:18.791
THING THAT WE ALWAYS DO.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.627
IN FACT, IN THE SIX YEARS AFTER

04:20.693 --> 04:22.695
THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE IN 1999,

04:22.762 --> 04:25.965
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AWARDED

04:26.032 --> 04:27.467
OVER $750 MILLION, RESULTING IN

04:27.533 --> 04:29.769
THE HIRING OF OVER 6,500 SROs.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.704
AND SINCE THEN, IT'S EXPLODED TO

04:31.771 --> 04:33.072
THE POINT THAT THE MOST RECENT

04:33.139 --> 04:34.674
DATA AVAILABLE SHOWS 58%

04:34.741 --> 04:36.909
OF AMERICAN SCHOOLS

04:36.976 --> 04:38.044
REPORT HAVING A SWORN LAW

04:38.111 --> 04:39.612
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ON CAMPUS AT

04:39.679 --> 04:42.515
LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

04:42.582 --> 04:43.983
AND THIS HAS HAPPENED, EVEN AS

04:44.050 --> 04:44.584
VITAL RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS

04:44.651 --> 04:46.552
HAVE BEEN STARVED.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.287
A RECENT REPORT FOUND

04:48.354 --> 04:50.123
14 MILLION STUDENTS GO TO

04:50.189 --> 04:52.525
A SCHOOL WITH POLICE

04:52.592 --> 04:54.394
BUT WITHOUT A COUNSELOR, NURSE,

04:54.460 --> 04:58.231
PSYCHOLOGIST, OR SOCIAL WORKER.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.732
THAT IS 14 MILLION KIDS WHO

04:59.799 --> 05:00.600
ARE IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO A

05:00.667 --> 05:02.535
PAIR OF HANDCUFFS THAN THEY ARE

05:02.602 --> 05:03.136
TO A MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH

05:03.202 --> 05:04.270
PROFESSIONAL.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.072
AND TO HEAR SOME SCHOOL COPS

05:06.139 --> 05:13.112
TELL IT, THEY'RE NOT JUST THERE

05:13.179 --> 05:15.548
there is upside to the presence

05:15.615 --> 05:16.082
beside safety.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.383
They are there to build trust

05:17.450 --> 05:26.726
and police from early age.

05:26.793 --> 05:27.760
>> UNFORTUNATELY, YES, IT --

05:27.827 --> 05:28.494
IT'S SAD, AND IF YOU THINK OF IT

05:28.561 --> 05:29.262
MORBIDLY.

05:29.328 --> 05:29.996
BUT, IF YOU THINK OF IT BUILDING

05:30.063 --> 05:30.596
RELATIONSHIPS FOR OUR FUTURE,

05:30.663 --> 05:30.830
WHY NOT?

05:30.897 --> 05:35.134
IT WOULDN'T HURT.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.436
>> John: WOULDN'T HURT?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.303
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

05:37.370 --> 05:38.471
BECAUSE, LITTLE SECRET: IF WE'RE

05:38.538 --> 05:39.539
SHOWING YOU SOMETHING ON THIS

05:39.605 --> 05:40.573
SHOW, IT COULD ABSOLUTELY HURT.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.240
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MOMENT

05:41.307 --> 05:42.308
WHERE WE'VE SHOWN YOU A CLIP

05:42.375 --> 05:43.643
WHERE A COP GOES "WOULDN'T

05:43.710 --> 05:44.610
HURT," AND WE'VE SAID "YOU'RE

05:44.677 --> 05:45.111
RIGHT, OFFICER BIG MAN,

05:45.178 --> 05:45.645
IT WOULDN'T!

05:45.712 --> 05:50.016
ANYWAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW,

05:50.083 --> 05:50.917
HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!"

05:50.983 --> 05:52.318
SO GIVEN THAT, ONCE AGAIN, IN

05:52.385 --> 05:53.586
THE WAKE OF YET ANOTHER SCHOOL

05:53.653 --> 05:54.821
SHOOTING, WE SEEM POISED TO

05:54.887 --> 05:56.055
THROW MORE COPS INTO OUR

05:56.122 --> 05:57.190
SCHOOLS, WE THOUGHT TONIGHT,

05:57.256 --> 05:58.224
IT'D BE WORTH TALKING ABOUT

05:58.291 --> 05:59.792
SCHOOL POLICE.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.260
WHETHER THEY'RE THE ANSWER TO

06:01.327 --> 06:04.163
THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM,

06:04.230 --> 06:05.231
THE ANSWER TO ANY PROBLEMS,

06:05.298 --> 06:05.998
OR WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY A

06:06.065 --> 06:06.833
PRETTY BIG PROBLEM THEMSELVES.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.401
AND LET'S START BY

06:08.468 --> 06:09.168
ACKNOWLEDGING THIS IDEA ISN'T

06:09.235 --> 06:10.737
JUST COMING FROM THE NRA.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.538
IT'S COMING FROM PARENTS, TOO,

06:12.605 --> 06:14.474
LIKE THIS MAN, WHO BACK IN

06:14.540 --> 06:15.108
FEBRUARY, SHOWED UP AT A COUNTY

06:15.174 --> 06:16.509
COUNCIL MEETING.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.044
>> ALEX TURNER TELLS US HE IS

06:18.111 --> 06:18.711
ALL IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA OF

06:18.778 --> 06:21.447
ADDING SROs.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.883
>> JUST FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT

06:23.950 --> 06:25.051
THEY'VE GOT A FORCE MULTIPLIER

06:25.118 --> 06:26.719
IN THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY COULD

06:26.786 --> 06:27.920
STOP SOME IMMINENT THREAT TO OUR

06:27.987 --> 06:29.222
CHILDREN.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.523
>> TURNER HAS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN

06:30.590 --> 06:31.724
AND HIS WIFE WORKS AT A SCHOOL

06:31.791 --> 06:34.293
DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.229
>> WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS

06:36.295 --> 06:37.096
IS THE THOUGHT OF HER HAVING TO

06:37.163 --> 06:40.032
USE A BACKPACK TO DEFEND HERSELF

06:40.099 --> 06:41.467
FROM SOMEONE WITH A GUN.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.369
>> OUR CHILDREN ARE THE MOST

06:43.436 --> 06:44.837
IMPORTANT THING TO OUR FUTURE,

06:44.904 --> 06:46.906
THEY'RE FUTURE TAXPAYERS,

06:46.973 --> 06:48.141
THEY'RE FUTURE CITIZENS THAT ARE

06:48.207 --> 06:48.775
GOING TO INVEST IN OUR

06:48.841 --> 06:51.944
COMMUNITY.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.880
>> John: OKAY, OBVIOUSLY THAT

06:53.946 --> 06:55.014
GUY CALLING CHILDREN "FUTURE TAX

06:55.081 --> 06:59.519
PAYERS" IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.720
ALTHOUGH WHO AMONG US HASN'T

07:00.787 --> 07:02.121
WALKED IN TO OUR SLEEPING

07:02.188 --> 07:02.755
CHILD'S ROOM, BECOME OVERTAKEN

07:02.822 --> 07:04.390
BY THE SERENITY ON THEIR FACE

07:04.457 --> 07:05.825
AND THOUGHT TO OURSELVES

07:05.892 --> 07:07.360
"WOW, WHAT A MIRACLE.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.028
I WONDER IF SHE'LL GROW UP TO

07:09.095 --> 07:10.963
FILE WITH A W-2 OR A 1099.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.298
PARENTHOOD TRULY IS A JOYOUS

07:12.365 --> 07:14.333
MYSTERY."

07:14.400 --> 07:15.601
BUT I DO GET WHAT HE'S TRYING TO

07:15.668 --> 07:16.602
SAY THERE.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.638
THE THOUGHT OF SOMEONE COMING

07:18.704 --> 07:19.672
INTO A SCHOOL AND HURTING YOUR

07:19.739 --> 07:22.275
CHILD IS INCREDIBLY SCARY.

07:22.341 --> 07:23.276
I DON'T THINK THAT ALL PEOPLE

07:23.342 --> 07:24.811
WHO BELIEVE THAT POLICE OFFICERS

07:24.877 --> 07:25.478
MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER HAVE BAD

07:25.545 --> 07:26.379
INTENTIONS OR ARE ARGUING IN

07:26.445 --> 07:29.515
BAD FAITH.

07:29.582 --> 07:30.416
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

07:30.483 --> 07:32.185
WRONG.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.553
BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD,

07:33.619 --> 07:34.720
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION,

07:34.787 --> 07:35.988
"DO POLICE IN SCHOOLS DETER

07:36.055 --> 07:37.190
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS?"

07:37.256 --> 07:39.425
IS BASICALLY "NO."

07:39.492 --> 07:40.526
EXPERTS WHO'VE STUDIED THIS HAVE

07:40.593 --> 07:43.229
FOUND THAT SCHOOL SHOOTERS WERE

07:43.296 --> 07:43.996
NOT DETERRED DUE TO THE

07:44.063 --> 07:44.697
PRESENCE OF METAL DETECTORS,

07:44.764 --> 07:46.566
LOCKED DOORS, SECURITY CAMERAS,

07:46.632 --> 07:48.534
OR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS.

07:48.601 --> 07:51.771
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

07:51.838 --> 07:53.840
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT WHEN

07:53.906 --> 07:55.074
A SHOOTING'S

07:55.141 --> 07:55.575
ACTUALLY HAPPENING?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.310
THEY COULD STOP THEM THEN,

07:57.376 --> 08:00.613
RIGHT?"

08:00.680 --> 08:02.181
DON'T BE SO SURE.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.650
WELL, FAMOUSLY, UVALDE HAD

08:04.717 --> 08:08.554
A POLICE OFFICER

08:08.621 --> 08:09.789
AND PARKLAND HAD ONE TOO.

08:09.856 --> 08:10.356
INSTANCES OF SCHOOL POLICE

08:10.423 --> 08:11.424
STOPPING SHOOTINGS ARE

08:11.490 --> 08:11.924
INCREDIBLY RARE.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.525
THERE WAS ONE EXAMPLE FOUR

08:12.592 --> 08:13.292
YEARS AGO, BUT WHEN THE

08:13.359 --> 08:14.627
WASHINGTON POST LOOKED INTO IT

08:14.694 --> 08:15.261
AFTER THAT, THEY COULD ONLY FIND

08:15.328 --> 08:16.229
ONE OTHER CASE IN THE

08:16.295 --> 08:16.762
PRECEDING 19 YEARS WHERE

08:16.829 --> 08:18.164
A RESOURCE OFFICER GUNNED DOWN

08:18.231 --> 08:18.598
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.132
IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH EASIER TO

08:20.199 --> 08:20.700
FIND STORIES OF SHOOTINGS

08:20.766 --> 08:22.401
STOPPED BY FACULTY AND SCHOOL

08:22.468 --> 08:23.769
COUNSELORS.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.605
BUT RATHER THAN ARGUING ANECDOTE

08:25.671 --> 08:27.406
BY ANECDOTE, IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL

08:27.473 --> 08:28.875
TO LOOK AT THE LARGER DATA.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.943
BECAUSE ON THE WHOLE, AN

08:31.010 --> 08:33.312
ANALYSIS OF 179 SHOOTINGS ON

08:33.379 --> 08:38.017
SCHOOL GROUNDS -- WHICH IS A

08:38.084 --> 08:45.524
BRUTAL THING TO

08:45.591 --> 08:46.392
SO SAY OUT LOUD ON ITS OWN.

08:46.459 --> 08:47.059
FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE

08:47.126 --> 08:47.994
PRESENCE OF SCHOOL RESOURCE

08:48.060 --> 08:48.594
OFFICERS LESSENED THE SEVERITY

08:48.661 --> 08:49.028
OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

08:49.095 --> 08:49.695
IF ANYTHING, THEY CAN ACTUALLY

08:49.762 --> 08:50.396
MAKE IT WORSE, AS THIS

08:50.463 --> 08:51.230
RESEARCHER EXPLAINS.

08:51.297 --> 08:51.898
>> SO, WHEN WE HAVE LOOKED AT

08:51.964 --> 08:52.465
THIS AND LOOKED AT SCHOOL

08:52.531 --> 08:53.165
SHOOTINGS AND ATTEMPTED SCHOOL

08:53.232 --> 08:54.433
SHOOTINGS, WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS

08:54.500 --> 08:56.302
THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ARMED

08:56.369 --> 08:57.837
OFFICERS ON THE SCENE,

08:57.904 --> 08:59.839
YOU ACTUALLY SEE MORE

08:59.906 --> 09:00.840
CASUALTIES, OFTEN BECAUSE THAT

09:00.907 --> 09:02.508
PERPETRATOR IS SUICIDAL.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.176
THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT

09:04.243 --> 09:05.344
SCHOOL, THEY KNOW THAT OFFICER

09:05.411 --> 09:06.646
IS THERE, AND SO THEY COME IN

09:06.712 --> 09:07.313
HEAVILY ARMED.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.015
>> John: RIGHT.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.883
AND IF SCHOOL COPS CAN MAKE

09:10.950 --> 09:12.218
SHOOTINGS WORSE, WHY, THEN,

09:12.285 --> 09:12.785
ARE WE STILL PITCHING THEM

09:12.852 --> 09:15.054
AS A SOLUTION?

09:15.121 --> 09:16.455
IF OFF DISCOVERED THAT THEIR

09:16.522 --> 09:17.490
MOSQUITO REPELLANT ATTRACTED

09:17.556 --> 09:19.558
MOSQUITOS,

09:19.625 --> 09:20.960
THEY'D STOP SELLING IT

09:21.027 --> 09:22.228
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, REBRAND

09:22.295 --> 09:23.262
IT AS A COLOGNE FOR LONELY

09:23.329 --> 09:25.598
MOSQUITO BACHELORS.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.800
THE POINT IS, THE EVIDENCE FOR

09:27.867 --> 09:29.468
COPS IN SCHOOLS DETERRING SCHOOL

09:29.535 --> 09:31.437
SHOOTINGS JUST ISN'T THERE.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.305
AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DAMAGE

09:32.371 --> 09:36.542
THEY CAN DO IS SIGNIFICANT.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.410
SO FOR THE REST OF THIS PIECE,

09:37.476 --> 09:38.778
LET'S ACTUALLY PUT SHOOTINGS

09:38.844 --> 09:40.913
ASIDE AND CONSIDER THE IMPACT

09:40.980 --> 09:42.615
THAT SCHOOL POLICE CAN HAVE ON

09:42.682 --> 09:44.984
KIDS, EVERY DAY THEY'RE THERE.

09:45.051 --> 09:45.851
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

09:45.918 --> 09:46.986
SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS --

09:47.053 --> 09:48.587
ESSENTIALLY, THE TRADE GROUP FOR

09:48.654 --> 09:49.956
THESE OFFICERS -- WILL ARGUE

09:50.022 --> 09:50.790
THEY SERVE MANY FUNCTIONS IN

09:50.856 --> 09:56.429
SCHOOLS BEYOND SECURITY.

09:56.495 --> 09:56.996
THEY EVEN DEVELOPED A TRIAD

09:57.063 --> 10:00.366
CONCEPT OF SCHOOL POLICING, THAT

10:00.433 --> 10:03.102
ENCOURAGES OFFICERS TO BE

10:03.169 --> 10:04.270
A TEACHER, INFORMAL COUNSELOR,

10:04.337 --> 10:04.937
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

10:05.004 --> 10:05.938
AND I'LL SAY THERE ARE

10:06.005 --> 10:06.672
UNDOUBTEDLY SCHOOLS WHERE SOME

10:06.739 --> 10:07.306
KIDS SEE THEIR POLICE OFFICERS

10:07.373 --> 10:08.307
THAT WAY.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.076
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN VIDEOS OF

10:10.142 --> 10:12.345
THEM DOING "CARPOOL KARAOKE"

10:12.411 --> 10:14.814
IN THEIR SQUAD CAR WITH KIDS,

10:14.880 --> 10:15.648
OR DOING A FUN DANCE

10:15.715 --> 10:17.350
AT THEIR HALFTIME SHOW.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.351
SOME HAVE EVEN JOINED KIDS IN

10:18.417 --> 10:19.685
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.821
>> IT'S NOT EVERY DAY THAT YOU

10:21.887 --> 10:23.656
SEE THE CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER

10:23.723 --> 10:25.925
TAKING ON THE ROLE OF CAST

10:25.992 --> 10:27.560
MEMBER IN THE SCHOOL MUSICAL.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.295
>> SHE SHOWED UP AT OUR FIRST

10:29.362 --> 10:30.863
REHEARSAL, OUR FIRST DANCE

10:30.930 --> 10:32.932
REHEARSAL, AND I WAS LIKE,

10:32.999 --> 10:33.766
"WHY IS OFFICER GRIFFIN HERE?

10:33.833 --> 10:36.302
IS SOMEONE IN TROUBLE?"

10:36.369 --> 10:37.003
BUT THEN EVERYONE WAS LIKE,

10:37.069 --> 10:37.970
"NO, SHE'S JOINING THE SHOW.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.238
SHE'S GONNA DANCE WITH US."

10:39.305 --> 10:41.507
AND I WAS SHOCKED.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.709
>> SHOCKED BECAUSE PRIOR TO HER

10:43.776 --> 10:45.378
PARTICIPATION, MOST OF THESE

10:45.444 --> 10:46.746
STUDENTS WERE INTIMIDATED BY THE

10:46.812 --> 10:47.446
OFFICER TASKED WITH KEEPING

10:47.513 --> 10:52.385
ORDER ON CAMPUS.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.853
>> John: IT'S TRUE, A COP

10:53.919 --> 10:54.553
WAS IN THE SCHOOL MUSICAL.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.354
AND JUST IMAGINE HOW CHALLENGING

10:55.421 --> 10:56.789
THAT CASTING DECISION MUST HAVE

10:56.856 --> 10:58.557
BEEN FOR THE THEATER TEACHER.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.326
"WELL, SUSIE HAS A FANTASTIC

11:00.393 --> 11:01.560
VOCAL RANGE, HANNAH B.

11:01.627 --> 11:02.695
REALLY LEARNED THE CHOREOGRAPHY,

11:02.762 --> 11:04.563
JILLIAN IS A SENIOR SO IT DOES

11:04.630 --> 11:06.399
FEEL LIKE IT'S HER TIME TO GET

11:06.465 --> 11:07.700
A BIG ROLE, BUT OFFICER GRIFFIN

11:07.767 --> 11:10.503
HAS A GUN.

11:10.569 --> 11:11.837
SO I GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO GO

11:11.904 --> 11:13.839
WITH OFFICER GRIFFIN."

11:13.906 --> 11:15.541
BUT CLEARLY, TAP-DANCING OFFICER

11:15.608 --> 11:17.710
GRIFFIN HERE IS NOT THE NORM.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.512
IN FACT, WHILE SCHOOL POLICE IN

11:19.578 --> 11:20.646
MORE WELL-RESOURCED SCHOOLS,

11:20.713 --> 11:24.016
OFTEN DO HAVE AN EXPANDED ROLE,

11:24.083 --> 11:24.517
INCLUDING EDUCATION AND

11:24.583 --> 11:25.317
MENTORING, IN DISADVANTAGED

11:25.384 --> 11:27.086
SCHOOLS, THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO

11:27.153 --> 11:28.554
ENGAGE PRIMARILY IN LAW

11:28.621 --> 11:31.924
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.459
AND FOR ALL NASRO'S TALK OF THE

11:33.526 --> 11:34.860
TRIAD MODEL, WHEN THEY ASKED

11:34.927 --> 11:35.861
THEIR MEMBERS WHICH PRONG THEY

11:35.928 --> 11:36.962
IDENTIFY WITH THE MOST,

11:37.029 --> 11:39.131
OVER TWO-THIRDS SELECTED

11:39.198 --> 11:40.566
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.234
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY DID.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.403
THEY'RE COPS.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.905
MOST COPS DON'T GET INTO COPPING

11:45.971 --> 11:46.539
BECAUSE THEY SECRETLY WANT TO BE

11:46.605 --> 11:48.707
COUNSELORS.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.242
THEY DO IT BECAUSE MOVIES MAKE

11:50.309 --> 11:51.577
IT LOOK EXCITING AND THEY'RE

11:51.644 --> 11:54.613
TIRED OF STOPPING AT RED LIGHTS.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.915
THAT'S WHY THEY DO IT.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.349
AND THE PROBLEM IS, FACULTY AND

11:57.416 --> 11:58.284
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WILL

11:58.350 --> 11:59.985
SOMETIMES USE THOSE COPS TO DEAL

12:00.052 --> 12:00.986
WITH BASIC DISCIPLINARY PROBLEMS

12:01.053 --> 12:02.121
IN THE SCHOOL, AS THIS TEACHER

12:02.188 --> 12:03.689
EXPLAINS.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.991
>> I SEE THAT TEACHERS HAVE

12:06.058 --> 12:07.359
NEGLECTED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

12:07.426 --> 12:08.961
HANDLE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ON

12:09.028 --> 12:10.396
THEIR OWN THAT THEY USED TO.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.564
THINGS THAT WERE UP TO THE

12:11.630 --> 12:12.565
TEACHER BEFORE ARE NOW JUST A

12:12.631 --> 12:13.799
PHONE CALL AWAY.

12:13.866 --> 12:14.767
>> HOW MANY OF YOUR PEERS ARE

12:14.834 --> 12:15.968
JUST PICKING UP THE PHONE AND

12:16.035 --> 12:16.702
CALLING THE SCHOOL RESOURCE

12:16.769 --> 12:17.069
OFFICER?

12:17.136 --> 12:18.237
>> I'D SAY THE MAJORITY OF

12:18.304 --> 12:20.940
TEACHERS ARE DOING THAT.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.642
DEFINITELY 75% OUT OF ALL OF US,

12:23.709 --> 12:25.211
IF I JUST WANT TO MAKE A ROUGH

12:25.277 --> 12:27.413
GUESS, ARE DOING THAT, BECAUSE

12:27.480 --> 12:28.681
THEY GO IN WITH A SET LESSON

12:28.747 --> 12:29.782
PLAN AND WHEN THE KID DOESN'T

12:29.849 --> 12:30.416
WANT TO DO IT, WHAT DO I DO?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.118
I GET HIM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.453
>> John: YEAH.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.221
BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD.

12:35.287 --> 12:35.988
AND I KNOW TEACHERS HAVE AN

12:36.055 --> 12:36.889
EXHAUSTING JOB.

12:36.956 --> 12:40.126
AND, FOR SOME REASON, SOCIETY

12:40.192 --> 12:40.693
HAS DECIDED THEIR REWARD FOR

12:40.759 --> 12:42.361
THAT IS INSULTINGLY LOW PAY AND

12:42.428 --> 12:43.863
OCCASIONAL THANK-YOU APPLES.

12:43.929 --> 12:44.830
AND IT'S NOT THE POINT HERE.

12:44.897 --> 12:48.167
BUT WHY APPLES?

12:48.234 --> 12:49.268
EXACTLY.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.236
WHY HAVE WE DECIDED TO REWARD

12:50.302 --> 12:51.303
TEACHERS THE SAME WAY WE REWARD

12:51.370 --> 12:53.038
MEDIOCRE HORSES?

12:53.105 --> 12:54.173
BECAUSE THE GOOD HORSES GET

12:54.240 --> 12:56.075
SUGAR CUBES.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.276
NOW, AM I SAYING TEACHERS SHOULD

12:57.343 --> 12:57.910
GET SUGAR CUBES INSTEAD OF

12:57.977 --> 12:59.278
APPLES?

12:59.345 --> 13:01.413
I'M NOT NOT SAYING THAT.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.449
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS,

13:03.516 --> 13:05.251
WHILE I UNDERSTAND A FRUSTRATED,

13:05.317 --> 13:06.485
OVERWORKED TEACHER WANTING A

13:06.552 --> 13:08.187
TROUBLEMAKING KID OUT OF THEIR

13:08.254 --> 13:12.091
CLASSROOM, INVOLVING THE POLICE

13:12.158 --> 13:12.658
IN THAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS

13:12.725 --> 13:14.460
IMPULSE, FOR MANY REASONS.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.661
ONE OF THEM IS, POLICE IN

13:15.728 --> 13:16.495
SCHOOLS CAN AND DO ARREST

13:16.562 --> 13:18.130
STUDENTS.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.065
IN FACT, IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR

13:20.132 --> 13:22.168
RECORDED, THEY DID THIS TO OVER

13:22.234 --> 13:24.136
54,000 OF THEM, WHICH IS A HUGE

13:24.203 --> 13:26.172
NUMBER.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.740
IF YOU ASKED ME "WHAT DO YOU

13:27.806 --> 13:29.208
THINK HAPPENS 54,000 TIMES

13:29.275 --> 13:30.075
INSIDE SCHOOLS?"

13:30.142 --> 13:31.844
I'D SAY "I DUNNO.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.012
THE NUMBER OF CLASSROOM PETS

13:33.078 --> 13:33.779
THAT WENT MISSING BECAUSE

13:33.846 --> 13:35.080
A STUDENT LEFT THE LID OFF

13:35.147 --> 13:36.849
THE CAGE," OR "THE NUMBER OF

13:36.916 --> 13:38.617
TIMES A TEACHER LOST TOTAL

13:38.684 --> 13:39.818
CONTROL OF HER CLASS WHEN

13:39.885 --> 13:40.653
ANY PART OF HER PRIVATE LIFE

13:40.719 --> 13:42.354
WAS REVEALED."

13:42.421 --> 13:43.189
"OH, MY GOD, SHE HAD HER

13:43.255 --> 13:44.390
COMPUTER HOOKED UP TO

13:44.456 --> 13:45.090
THE PROJECTOR AND AN E-VITE

13:45.157 --> 13:46.125
FROM SOMEONE NAMED JIM

13:46.192 --> 13:47.026
APPEARED.

13:47.092 --> 13:48.761
WHO IS JIM?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.563
ARE YOU IN LOVE?

13:50.629 --> 13:54.333
WILL YOU HAVE HIS BABIES?"

13:54.400 --> 13:56.502
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

13:56.569 --> 13:57.436
"WOW, A KID MUST BE DOING

13:57.503 --> 13:58.037
SOMETHING REALLY BAD

13:58.103 --> 14:00.339
TO GET ARRESTED IN SCHOOL,"

14:00.406 --> 14:01.707
NOT REALLY.

14:01.774 --> 14:05.945
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH

14:06.011 --> 14:09.949
ASSAULT FOR THINGS LIKE THROWING

14:10.015 --> 14:12.084
A PAPER AIRPLANE, A BABY CARROT,

14:12.151 --> 14:12.651
AND SKITTLES, AND DRUG

14:12.718 --> 14:13.285
POSSESSION FOR CARRYING A MAPLE

14:13.352 --> 14:14.253
LEAF.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.120
AND WHEN A FIVE YEAR OLD WITH

14:15.187 --> 14:16.455
ADHD HAD A TANTRUM, THEY WERE

14:16.522 --> 14:20.326
CHARGED WITH BATTERY ON A POLICE

14:20.392 --> 14:22.294
OFFICER WHEN CLEARLY THE ONLY

14:22.361 --> 14:26.131
THING THEY WERE GUILTY OF WAS

14:26.198 --> 14:26.932
BEING A FUCKING FIVE YEAR OLD.

14:26.999 --> 14:27.967
AND TAKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

14:28.033 --> 14:28.467
KIERA WILMOT.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.969
WHEN SHE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL

14:30.035 --> 14:30.603
STUDENT, SHE TRIED TO REPLICATE

14:30.669 --> 14:31.203
AN EXPERIMENT SHE'D SEEN IN

14:31.270 --> 14:31.737
CLASS, WHERE YOU SET OFF A

14:31.804 --> 14:32.338
CHEMICAL REACTION IN A PLASTIC

14:32.404 --> 14:33.339
BOTTLE TO MAKE THE CAP BLOW OFF.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.607
AND I'LL LET HER AND THEN HER

14:34.673 --> 14:35.174
MOTHER EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED

14:35.241 --> 14:37.176
NEXT.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.378
>> THE PRINCIPAL AND VICE

14:39.445 --> 14:41.914
PRINCIPAL WERE, LIKE, ABOUT TEN

14:41.981 --> 14:43.015
FEET AWAY, AND WHEN IT POPPPED,

14:43.082 --> 14:44.183
THEY CAME OVER AND ASKED WHAT

14:44.250 --> 14:44.917
WAS GOING ON, I TOLD THEM IT WAS

14:44.984 --> 14:45.551
A SCIENCE PROJECT AND THEY WERE

14:45.618 --> 14:50.356
JUST LIKE, "OKAY."

14:50.422 --> 14:51.657
AT THE END OF THIRD PERIOD, THEY

14:51.724 --> 14:53.559
TAKE ME OUT AND THEN WALK ME TO

14:53.626 --> 14:56.629
THE RESOURCE OFFICER.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.098
HE WAS LIKE, "THIS IS CONSIDERED

14:59.164 --> 14:59.365
A FELONY.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.299
I MIGHT HAVE TO ARREST YOU FOR

15:00.366 --> 15:01.367
THIS."

15:01.433 --> 15:02.501
AND THEN I WAS JUST HANDCUFFED

15:02.568 --> 15:03.769
AND PUT IN THE CAR.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.506
>> A TRAINED OFFICER OF THE LAW

15:07.573 --> 15:08.741
ARRESTED, PUT MY DAUGHTER IN

15:08.807 --> 15:09.775
HANDCUFFS, PUT HER IN THE BACK

15:09.842 --> 15:12.478
OF A POLICE CAR, AND TOOK HER TO

15:12.544 --> 15:18.417
THE JUVENILE ASSESSMENT CENTER

15:18.484 --> 15:19.518
AND CHARGED HER WITH TWO FELONY

15:19.585 --> 15:21.287
CHARGES.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.756
>> John: THAT IS SO FUCKING

15:23.822 --> 15:24.990
STUPID FOR SO MANY REASONS,

15:25.057 --> 15:26.458
ONE OF WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU

15:26.525 --> 15:27.793
HEAR "FELONY FOR A SCIENCE

15:27.860 --> 15:28.661
EXPERIMENT," YOU'RE THINKING

15:28.727 --> 15:30.296
METH.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.398
IF I GAVE YOU 500 GUESSES

15:32.464 --> 15:34.166
FOR "WHAT SCIENCE EXPERIMENT

15:34.233 --> 15:34.600
GOT SOMEONE CHARGED

15:34.667 --> 15:36.001
WITH A FELONY?"

15:36.068 --> 15:37.436
YOUR FIRST 499 GUESSES WOULD BE

15:37.503 --> 15:39.805
METH, AND THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE,

15:39.872 --> 15:40.606
"ARE YOU 100% SURE IT'S NOT

15:40.673 --> 15:42.308
METH?"

15:42.374 --> 15:44.343
NEVER IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS

15:44.410 --> 15:45.644
WOULD IT BE POPPING

15:45.711 --> 15:46.779
A BOTTLE CAP.

15:46.845 --> 15:47.680
UNLESS INSIDE THAT BOTTLE WAS

15:47.746 --> 15:49.448
SOME METH.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.016
NOW, I SHOULD SAY THE CHARGES

15:51.083 --> 15:51.550
AGAINST KIERA WERE LATER

15:51.617 --> 15:53.052
DROPPED.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.720
BUT SHE STILL HAD TO CHECK THE

15:54.787 --> 15:56.689
BOX ON HER COLLEGE APPLICATION

15:56.755 --> 15:58.724
ASKING "HAVE YOU BEEN ARRESTED?"

15:58.791 --> 16:00.292
AND, AS CRAZY AS THIS SOUNDS,

16:00.359 --> 16:01.827
SHE WAS ACTUALLY LUCKY, IN THAT

16:01.894 --> 16:05.331
AT LEAST SHE HAD PRESS COVERAGE

16:05.397 --> 16:05.898
OF HER RIDICULOUS ARREST SHE

16:05.964 --> 16:07.633
COULD DIRECT THE COLLEGE TO.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.735
BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE

16:09.802 --> 16:10.836
CASE FOR MANY, MANY OTHERS.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.571
THE FACT IS, KIDS WITH CRIMINAL

16:12.638 --> 16:14.073
RECORDS CAN HAVE A MUCH HARDER

16:14.139 --> 16:15.841
TIME GETTING JOBS, SCHOLARSHIPS,

16:15.908 --> 16:17.509
AND A HOST OF OTHER BENEFITS AND

16:17.576 --> 16:18.477
OPPORTUNITIES.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.445
AND WHILE IT'S TRUE YOU CAN

16:19.511 --> 16:20.512
APPLY TO HAVE YOUR JUVENILE

16:20.579 --> 16:22.648
RECORD SEALED -- USUALLY ONCE

16:22.715 --> 16:24.216
YOU TURN 18 -- THERE'S NO

16:24.283 --> 16:26.518
GUARANTEE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.320
SO AN ARREST ALONE CAN STILL DO

16:28.387 --> 16:30.556
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE, AS SOME OF

16:30.622 --> 16:31.156
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM

16:31.223 --> 16:34.159
WILL ADMIT.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.260
>> I THINK WE CERTAINLY SEE A

16:35.327 --> 16:35.894
LOT OF CASES THAT WE THINK,

16:35.961 --> 16:36.695
"SERIOUSLY?"

16:36.762 --> 16:38.497
>> GARNETTE SAYS CLOSE TO 70% OF

16:38.564 --> 16:40.499
THE TIME, HER PROBATION OFFICERS

16:40.566 --> 16:41.800
DECIDE THE OFFENSE ISN'T

16:41.867 --> 16:43.035
ACTUALLY SERIOUS ENOUGH TO GET

16:43.102 --> 16:44.503
REFERRED TO THE DISTRICT

16:44.570 --> 16:46.472
ATTORNEY FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.407
BUT EVEN IN THOSE CASES, MUCH OF

16:48.474 --> 16:51.944
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.414
>> THE CHILD CAN STILL BE LEFT

16:55.481 --> 16:56.482
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD?

16:56.548 --> 16:57.349
>> WELL, IT'LL STILL SHOW AN

16:57.416 --> 16:57.983
ARREST ON THEIR -- ON THEIR RAP

16:58.050 --> 16:58.450
SHEET.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.318
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

16:59.385 --> 17:00.386
THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.153
I MEAN, IF THEY -- IF THE CASE

17:01.220 --> 17:02.254
COMES TO US, THEY'VE BEEN

17:02.321 --> 17:02.888
ARRESTED, WHETHER THEY WERE PUT

17:02.955 --> 17:04.323
IN HANDCUFFS AND BROUGHT TO US

17:04.390 --> 17:05.958
OR JUST GIVEN A SLIP OF PAPER BY

17:06.024 --> 17:06.558
THE POLICE, THEY'VE HAVE BEEN

17:06.625 --> 17:07.860
ARRESTED.

17:07.926 --> 17:08.660
>> AND IS THAT FAIR?

17:08.727 --> 17:14.700
>> WELL, I MEAN...

17:14.767 --> 17:16.869
NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.203
>> John: WOW, THAT WAS A LONG

17:18.270 --> 17:18.737
PAUSE.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.174
IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN THAT A

17:22.241 --> 17:22.708
CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER IS

17:22.775 --> 17:23.709
RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION

17:23.776 --> 17:25.277
"IS THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FAIR?"

17:25.344 --> 17:26.745
LIKE THEY'RE STALLING FOR TIME

17:26.812 --> 17:27.880
ON JEOPARDY AFTER ACCIDENTALLY

17:27.946 --> 17:30.182
BUZZING IN.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.817
AND I WILL SAY AT LEAST SHE'S

17:31.884 --> 17:32.451
ACKNOWLEDGING THERE THAT THE

17:32.518 --> 17:33.152
SYSTEM HAS A SIGNIFICANT

17:33.218 --> 17:36.255
PROBLEM.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.490
WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY MADDENING IS

17:38.557 --> 17:39.658
WATCHING THIS FORMER DIRECTOR OF

17:39.725 --> 17:40.626
STUDENT SERVICES FOR THE COUNTY

17:40.692 --> 17:41.193
WHERE SHE WORKS TRY TO MAKE

17:41.260 --> 17:43.061
EXCUSES FOR IT.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.463
>> NO STUDENT ON OUR -- THAT'S

17:44.530 --> 17:45.764
ATTENDING OUR CAMPUS IS GETTING

17:45.831 --> 17:47.666
A CRIMINAL RECORD BECAUSE OF

17:47.733 --> 17:48.967
SOMETHING WE'VE DONE.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.903
WE DON'T FOCUS ON ARRESTING

17:50.969 --> 17:52.871
OR SENDING KIDS AWAY.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.273
THAT'S -- THAT'S COMPLETELY

17:54.339 --> 17:54.840
COUNTER TO WHAT AN EDUCATOR

17:54.907 --> 17:55.774
SHOULD DO.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.610
>> BUT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

17:58.677 --> 17:59.978
>> THAT IS NOT HAPPENING

18:00.045 --> 18:01.680
IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.748
>> BUT IN A SINGLE SCHOOL YEAR,

18:02.815 --> 18:03.582
283 KIDS IN YOUR DISTRICT WERE

18:03.649 --> 18:05.751
REFERRED TO POLICE.

18:05.818 --> 18:06.185
>> OKAY.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.619
>> SO IT IS HAPPENING.

18:07.686 --> 18:08.954
>> I -- KIDS ARE CITED ON OUR

18:09.021 --> 18:10.422
CAMPUSES SOMETIMES, YES.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.356
>> AND DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS CAN

18:11.423 --> 18:12.791
GIVE THEM A CRIMINAL RECORD?

18:12.858 --> 18:14.460
>> I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I

18:14.526 --> 18:16.061
ISSUE MY OWN CONSEQUENCES.

18:16.128 --> 18:16.795
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

18:16.862 --> 18:17.896
POLICE ISSUE THEIR CONSEQUENCES.

18:17.963 --> 18:18.630
>> SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT

18:18.697 --> 18:19.565
THESE KIDS ARE GETTING CRIMINAL

18:19.631 --> 18:20.699
RECORDS?

18:20.766 --> 18:21.366
>> I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT ONE WAY

18:21.433 --> 18:23.602
OR THE OTHER.

18:23.669 --> 18:24.603
>> BUT DON'T YOU HEAD DISCIPLINE

18:24.670 --> 18:25.504
FOR THE DISTRICT?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.573
>> AND I TAKE CARE OF DISCIPLINE

18:27.639 --> 18:28.640
FOR THE DISTRICT.

18:28.707 --> 18:29.575
IF CONSEQUENCES GO BEYOND THAT

18:29.641 --> 18:30.909
INTO THE -- INTO THE LEGAL

18:30.976 --> 18:31.877
REALM, THAT'S NOT OUR PURVIEW.

18:31.944 --> 18:36.181
THAT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.250
>> John: HOLY SHIT,

18:38.317 --> 18:39.351
THAT IS SELECTIVE.

18:39.418 --> 18:40.352
"NOT YOUR BUSINESS?"

18:40.419 --> 18:40.953
OH, NO, MY GOOD BITCH, THAT IS

18:41.019 --> 18:43.889
VERY MUCH YOUR BUSINESS.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.191
AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE

18:46.258 --> 18:46.959
DISTINCTION THAT BUDGET

18:47.025 --> 18:47.793
BILL MURRAY IS

18:47.860 --> 18:48.527
TRYING TO DRAW THERE.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.094
THERE'S "SCHOOL DISCIPLINE,"

18:49.161 --> 18:50.295
WHICH FALLS UNDER HIS PURVIEW,

18:50.362 --> 18:50.963
BUT IF A KID BREAKS THE LAW,

18:51.029 --> 18:52.431
THEN IT'S A POLICE THING.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.565
BUT IN PRACTICE, ONCE YOU LET

18:53.632 --> 18:55.267
THE POLICE INTO YOUR SCHOOLS,

18:55.334 --> 18:58.337
THAT LINE GETS REALLY BLURRY.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.638
AND YOU'RE GOING TO START

18:59.705 --> 19:00.472
GETTING STUPID ARRESTS FOR

19:00.539 --> 19:02.541
THINGS LIKE SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS,

19:02.608 --> 19:03.642
OR THROWING BABY CARROTS, OR --

19:03.709 --> 19:06.612
IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THAT GUY

19:06.678 --> 19:08.180
WORKED -- THE INDEFENSIBLE

19:08.247 --> 19:10.215
ARREST OF THIS AUTISTIC STUDENT.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.884
>> TWO YEARS AGO, ADRIAN WAS AT

19:11.950 --> 19:13.118
HIS SCHOOL, BRET HARTE MIDDLE IN

19:13.185 --> 19:15.153
SAN JOSE, WHEN HE USED A SMALL

19:15.220 --> 19:17.823
ROCK TO ETCH THE LETTERS ADRX

19:17.890 --> 19:21.260
ON THE SIDEWALK.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.795
THE ABBREVIATION IS HOW

19:23.862 --> 19:24.863
ADRIAN OFTEN SIGNED HIS NAME ON

19:24.930 --> 19:26.031
SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS.

19:26.098 --> 19:26.632
THE LETTERS MEASURED JUST SIX

19:26.698 --> 19:27.232
INCHES TALL.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.635
BUT THE SCHOOL BELIEVED THEY

19:29.701 --> 19:30.402
WERE BIG ENOUGH A REASON TO

19:30.469 --> 19:31.136
INVOLVE CAMPUS POLICE.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.704
ADRIAN WAS ARRESTED AT 13.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.273
>> I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE WOULD

19:34.339 --> 19:35.908
LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "OH, LOOK,

19:35.974 --> 19:37.509
A LEGEND.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.444
OH, LOOK, A LEGEND

19:39.511 --> 19:40.045
THAT DID THIS.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.079
THIS IS SO COOL.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.048
A LEGEND WAS AT THIS SCHOOL."

19:43.115 --> 19:44.550
>> John: OKAY, FOR THE RECORD,

19:44.616 --> 19:45.584
THAT KID WAS, AND REMAINS,

19:45.651 --> 19:47.786
A LEGEND.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.521
BECAUSE TO 13-YEAR-OLDS,

19:49.588 --> 19:52.524
THERE IS SIMPLY NOTHING COOLER

19:52.591 --> 19:53.258
THAN INITIALS WRITTEN SOMEWHERE.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.526
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE

19:54.593 --> 19:55.260
OR WITH WHAT.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.595
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT

19:56.662 --> 19:57.329
INITIALS ARE SOMEWHERE AND

19:57.396 --> 19:58.163
THAT'S COOL.

19:58.230 --> 19:58.430
ON A DESK?

19:58.497 --> 19:59.531
YES, PLEASE.

19:59.598 --> 20:00.766
ON A LAMP POST?

20:00.832 --> 20:02.301
I LOVE IT.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.702
WAY HIGH UP ON A WALL?

20:03.769 --> 20:06.371
HOW DID THEY GET IT UP THERE?

20:06.438 --> 20:09.474
WE EVEN PUT ADRIAN'S INITIALS

20:09.541 --> 20:17.249
ONTO THE SET BEHIND ME TO MAKE

20:17.316 --> 20:18.584
IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO EVERYONE

20:18.650 --> 20:18.984
THAT A LEGEND WAS

20:19.051 --> 20:19.851
VERY MUCH HERE.

20:19.918 --> 20:20.652
THAT STORY'S COMPLETELY

20:20.719 --> 20:21.353
BANANAS, EVEN BEFORE YOU LEARN

20:21.420 --> 20:21.987
THAT THE LETTERS HE ETCHED CAME

20:22.054 --> 20:22.721
RIGHT OFF WITH SOME SOAP AND

20:22.788 --> 20:23.355
WATER AFTER HIS MOTHER HAD HIM

20:23.422 --> 20:24.189
CLEAN IT UP.

20:24.256 --> 20:25.757
BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO A BIGGER

20:25.824 --> 20:27.259
ISSUE, WHICH IS THAT STUDENTS

20:27.326 --> 20:28.393
WITH DISABILITIES ARE ALMOST

20:28.460 --> 20:30.095
THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE

20:30.162 --> 20:31.730
ARRESTED, EVEN THOUGH KIDS WITH

20:31.797 --> 20:33.699
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES CAN

20:33.765 --> 20:36.602
HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING OR

20:36.668 --> 20:38.136
FOLLOWING THE RULES AND REQUIRE

20:38.203 --> 20:38.937
SUPPORT STAFF FAMILIAR WITH

20:39.004 --> 20:43.008
THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.

20:43.075 --> 20:43.842
AND THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY

20:43.909 --> 20:44.776
STUDENTS DISPROPORTIONATELY

20:44.843 --> 20:45.577
SINGLED OUT.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.912
BECAUSE COPS IN SCHOOLS DO TEND

20:46.979 --> 20:48.280
TO BEHAVE THE SAME WAY THEY

20:48.347 --> 20:50.182
BEHAVE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS, WHICH

20:50.248 --> 20:51.149
EXPLAINS WHY BLACK STUDENTS

20:51.216 --> 20:52.951
ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY A THIRD OF

20:53.018 --> 20:54.553
ALL STUDENTS ARRESTED, DESPITE

20:54.620 --> 20:55.387
THE FACT THAT THAT'S TWICE THEIR

20:55.454 --> 20:57.322
SHARE OF ENROLLMENT.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.857
THAT'S JUST ONE REASON WHY,

20:58.924 --> 21:00.192
WHILE YOU MAY HEAR A LOT OF

21:00.258 --> 21:01.960
WHITE KIDS TALK ABOUT THEIR

21:02.027 --> 21:03.795
FRIENDLY SRO, BLACK STUDENTS

21:03.862 --> 21:04.963
EVEN IN THE SAME SCHOOL MAY

21:05.030 --> 21:08.033
SEE THEM VERY DIFFERENTLY.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.335
>> IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THIS MAN

21:10.402 --> 21:11.269
WAS JUDGE, JURY,

21:11.336 --> 21:12.504
AND EXECUTIONER.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.306
AND HE WAS MENACING LOOKING.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.641
AND, LITERALLY, HE WALKED

21:15.707 --> 21:16.441
THROUGH THE HALLS LIKE HE OWNED

21:16.508 --> 21:17.976
THE PLACE.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.111
EVERY CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH

21:19.177 --> 21:21.046
HIM WAS TENSE.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.481
IT WAS LITERALLY JUST STUDENTS

21:22.547 --> 21:24.282
OF COLOR.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.852
I DON'T THINK, EVEN THE BLACK

21:26.918 --> 21:28.120
SRO THAT WE HAD AT SOUTHWEST,

21:28.186 --> 21:28.687
I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SPEAK

21:28.754 --> 21:30.756
TO A WHITE STUDENT.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.457
THEY KNEW WHO THEY WERE LOOKING

21:32.524 --> 21:35.560
FOR, THEY HAD THEIR KIDS THAT

21:35.627 --> 21:37.195
THEY, LIKE, LOW-KEY TERRORIZED?

21:37.262 --> 21:38.730
THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS WHO

21:38.797 --> 21:41.033
WOULD'VE HAD A GREAT TIME BUT

21:41.099 --> 21:44.536
HAD A HORRIBLE TIME BECAUSE OF

21:44.603 --> 21:46.605
AN SRO OR BECAUSE OF A COP.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.206
>> John: RIGHT.

21:48.273 --> 21:48.840
THE PRESENCE OF POLICE CAN MAKE

21:48.907 --> 21:50.208
SCHOOL MISERABLE FOR SOME KIDS,

21:50.275 --> 21:52.344
AND WE FRANKLY DON'T NEED ANY

21:52.411 --> 21:53.612
MORE WAYS TO MAKE SCHOOL

21:53.679 --> 21:54.946
SCARIER.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.682
IT'S ALREADY TERRIFYING ENOUGH.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.483
IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT'S THE

21:58.550 --> 22:00.252
SCARIEST PLACE I CAN IMAGINE,

22:00.318 --> 22:01.753
IT'S NOT A HAUNTED HOUSE OR THE

22:01.820 --> 22:04.156
INSIDE OF TOM CRUISE'S BRAIN.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.390
IT'S HIGH SCHOOL.

22:05.457 --> 22:10.262
BECAUSE REMEMBER, I WAS THIS.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.564
AND IT'S NOT JUST LOW-KEY

22:12.631 --> 22:13.999
TERRORIZING.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.133
YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH VIRAL

22:15.200 --> 22:17.002
VIDEOS OF SCHOOL COPS BEHAVING

22:17.069 --> 22:18.170
VIOLENTLY, VIDEOS THAT SOMETIMES

22:18.236 --> 22:19.604
WENT ON TO MAKE HEADLINES LIKE

22:19.671 --> 22:23.442
THESE.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.443
AND BECAUSE COPS IN SCHOOLS

22:24.509 --> 22:25.210
ENJOY ALL THE SAME PROTECTIONS

22:25.277 --> 22:26.378
THEY DO EVERYWHERE ELSE, THE

22:26.445 --> 22:27.546
CONSEQUENCES IN MANY OF THESE

22:27.612 --> 22:29.347
CASES CAN BE NONEXISTENT.

22:29.414 --> 22:31.249
IN OSCEOLA COUNTY, FLORIDA,

22:31.316 --> 22:32.884
AN OFFICER WAS FILMED THROWING

22:32.951 --> 22:34.920
A FEMALE STUDENT TO THE FLOOR,

22:34.986 --> 22:36.288
KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS.

22:36.354 --> 22:36.988
BUT HE WASN'T CHARGED WITH ANY

22:37.055 --> 22:38.457
WRONGDOING.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.559
AND HIS SUPERVISOR, THE COUNTY

22:40.625 --> 22:42.027
SHERIFF, FULLY SUPPORTED THAT

22:42.094 --> 22:42.994
OUTCOME.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.062
>> A LOT OF THINGS ARE NEVER

22:44.129 --> 22:44.696
GOING TO LOOK PRETTY ON CAMERA,

22:44.763 --> 22:46.465
BUT GUESS WHAT?

22:46.531 --> 22:49.134
YOU KNOW, THIS WORKED OUT, AND

22:49.201 --> 22:50.268
IT'S A POSITIVE THING FOR LAW

22:50.335 --> 22:51.837
ENFORCEMENT.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.472
>> SHERIFF LOPEZ DEFENDING

22:53.538 --> 22:54.840
DEPUTY FOURNIER'S ACTIONS,

22:54.906 --> 22:55.440
DESPITE CRITICISM AND PUBLIC

22:55.507 --> 22:57.109
SCRUTINY.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.410
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE

22:58.477 --> 23:00.445
YOUNG LADY WENT THROUGH THIS

23:00.512 --> 23:01.813
INCIDENT, BUT IT'S ALSO

23:01.880 --> 23:04.549
UNFORTUNATE THAT MY DEPUTY HAD

23:04.616 --> 23:07.018
TO SUFFER A LOT OF CONSTANT

23:07.085 --> 23:08.453
BASHING AND HARASSMENT,

23:08.520 --> 23:10.322
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE JUST DID WITH

23:10.388 --> 23:12.090
HOW HE WAS TRAINED.

23:12.157 --> 23:12.924
>> John: I HONESTLY THINK NO ONE

23:12.991 --> 23:14.659
MAKES A BETTER CASE FOR

23:14.726 --> 23:15.627
DEFUNDING THE POLICE THAN THE

23:15.694 --> 23:22.434
POLICE THEMSELVES.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.735
IF THROWING A KID TO THE GROUND

23:23.802 --> 23:24.636
AND THEN HAVING YOUR BOSS

23:24.703 --> 23:26.171
COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW EVERYONE WAS

23:26.238 --> 23:26.671
RUDE TO YOU AFTERWARD IS

23:26.738 --> 23:27.339
EMBLEMATIC OF HOW YOU WERE

23:27.405 --> 23:28.273
TRAINED, THEN THE PROBLEM IS

23:28.340 --> 23:29.374
CLEARLY THE TRAINING, THE COPS

23:29.441 --> 23:30.842
THEMSELVES, THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

23:30.909 --> 23:32.444
AND -- NOT FOR NOTHING --

23:32.511 --> 23:33.311
THAT SHERRIFF'S FAKE OAKLEY

23:33.378 --> 23:34.846
SUNGLASSES.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.548
BUT THE SHERIFF OF FLAVORTOWN

23:36.615 --> 23:37.182
HERE DOES RAISE AN INTERESTING

23:37.249 --> 23:38.450
POINT.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.652
SCHOOL POLICE GET TRAINED

23:40.719 --> 23:41.920
AS COPS, BUT THAT MIGHT BE THE

23:41.987 --> 23:44.122
ONLY TRAINING THEY GET.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.957
BECAUSE REQUIREMENTS VARY WIDELY

23:46.024 --> 23:46.591
IN EACH STATE, IF THEY EXIST AT

23:46.658 --> 23:48.059
ALL.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.027
AND NATIONAL TRAINING

23:49.094 --> 23:50.896
REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL-BASED

23:50.962 --> 23:52.464
LAW ENFORCEMENT SIMPLY DO NOT

23:52.531 --> 23:53.865
EXIST.

23:53.932 --> 23:54.733
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT LAW

23:54.800 --> 23:57.369
ENFORCEMENT STATIONED IN A

23:57.435 --> 23:57.869
SCHOOL, TAKING ORDINARY

23:57.936 --> 23:59.204
DISCIPLINARY SITUATIONS AND

23:59.271 --> 24:00.138
ESCALATING THEM, THE

24:00.205 --> 24:02.107
CONSEQUENCES, AS YOU'VE SEEN,

24:02.174 --> 24:05.911
CAN BE TERRIBLE.

24:05.977 --> 24:06.945
IN RESEARCHING THIS PIECE, WE

24:07.012 --> 24:07.879
FOUND SO MANY STORIES WHERE KIDS

24:07.946 --> 24:10.448
ARE STILL TRAUMATIZED BY THE

24:10.515 --> 24:11.917
EXPERIENCES THEY HAD, EVEN YEARS

24:11.983 --> 24:13.084
LATER, AND FELT IT BOTH CHANGED

24:13.151 --> 24:14.686
THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES,

24:14.753 --> 24:17.155
AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH THE

24:17.222 --> 24:18.356
WORLD.

24:18.423 --> 24:20.125
IF YOU'RE OVER A CERTAIN AGE,

24:20.192 --> 24:21.293
THIS IS SO MUCH MORE PREVALENT

24:21.359 --> 24:22.828
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.429
WE DON'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY

24:24.496 --> 24:26.097
LARGE STAFF, BUT MULTIPLE

24:26.164 --> 24:27.566
MEMBERS OF IT HAVE COME FORWARD

24:27.632 --> 24:30.068
AS WE PUT THIS STORY TOGETHER,

24:30.135 --> 24:31.236
CITING TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR BY

24:31.303 --> 24:32.637
SCHOOL POLICE THEY'D EITHER

24:32.704 --> 24:34.072
DIRECTLY WITNESSED OR

24:34.139 --> 24:36.074
EXPERIENCED FIRST-HAND.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.609
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

24:37.676 --> 24:39.411
THE FACT THAT SCHOOLS WITH

24:39.477 --> 24:40.111
SROs HAVE HIGHER RATES OF

24:40.178 --> 24:40.846
EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE --

24:40.912 --> 24:42.581
THINGS LIKE SUSPENSIONS AND

24:42.647 --> 24:44.482
EXPULSIONS -- THAN COMPARABLE

24:44.549 --> 24:46.985
SCHOOLS WITHOUT SROs, WHICH

24:47.052 --> 24:48.153
HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED

24:48.220 --> 24:49.221
WITH LOWER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT,

24:49.287 --> 24:50.655
DROPOUT, AND INCREASED

24:50.722 --> 24:51.690
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS BOTH IN AND

24:51.756 --> 24:53.191
OUT OF SCHOOL.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.926
SO WHEN THAT GUY EARLIER ARGUED

24:54.993 --> 24:56.328
FOR MORE POLICE IN EVERY SCHOOL,

24:56.394 --> 24:56.928
SAYING, "WHY NOT?

24:56.995 --> 24:58.864
IT WOULDN'T HURT."

24:58.930 --> 25:00.398
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS,

25:00.465 --> 25:01.967
"IT ABSOLUTELY CAN, AND IT DOES,

25:02.033 --> 25:05.103
ALL THE TIME."

25:05.170 --> 25:06.538
AND FOR ALL THE ARGUING RIGHT

25:06.605 --> 25:07.973
NOW ABOUT HOW WE NEED MORE

25:08.039 --> 25:10.308
POLICE IN SCHOOLS, I'D ARGUE

25:10.375 --> 25:11.042
THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY NEED

25:11.109 --> 25:13.378
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.580
AND SMALL REFORMS JUST AREN'T

25:15.647 --> 25:16.815
GOING TO CUT IT HERE.

25:16.882 --> 25:17.816
SOME PLACES HAVE TRIED THAT,

25:17.883 --> 25:19.751
WITH TACTICS THAT KEPT THE

25:19.818 --> 25:20.485
POLICE IN SCHOOLS BUT TRIED TO

25:20.552 --> 25:21.019
MAKE THEM APPEAR LESS

25:21.086 --> 25:22.487
INTIMIDATING.

25:22.554 --> 25:23.922
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO,

25:23.989 --> 25:24.956
SOME DISTRICTS IN MINNESOTA,

25:25.023 --> 25:26.725
WHERE THAT KID WENT TO SCHOOL,

25:26.791 --> 25:28.526
REDESIGNED THEIR SCHOOL POLICE

25:28.593 --> 25:29.094
UNIFORMS TO LIGHT-BLUE POLO

25:29.160 --> 25:30.228
SHIRTS.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.030
SOMETHING THAT, UNSURPRISINGLY,

25:32.097 --> 25:33.198
STUDENTS THERE, INCLUDING HIM,

25:33.265 --> 25:35.800
SAW RIGHT THROUGH.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.369
>> EVERY DAY I GO TO SCHOOL

25:37.435 --> 25:39.871
AS A YOUNG BLACK MALE TEEN,

25:39.938 --> 25:42.307
AND I HAVE TO SEE OUR SRO

25:42.374 --> 25:43.441
JUST WANDERING THE HALLWAYS.

25:43.508 --> 25:44.809
HE'S ALWAYS IN OUR CLASSROOMS.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.211
HE'S ALWAYS IN THE HALLWAYS.

25:46.278 --> 25:47.679
YOUR COMPROMISE IS TO GIVE THEM

25:47.746 --> 25:49.014
SOFTER OUTFITS?

25:49.080 --> 25:51.016
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

25:51.082 --> 25:52.651
LIKE, IT'S -- AT THE END OF THE

25:52.717 --> 25:53.785
DAY, A COP IS A COP.

25:53.852 --> 25:54.953
WHETHER YOU DRESS THEM UP IN

25:55.020 --> 25:56.154
RED, YELLOW, BLUE, IT DOESN'T

25:56.221 --> 26:01.326
MATTER.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.628
TEENAGERS AREN'T

26:03.695 --> 26:04.462
TEENAGERS AREN'T STUPID.

26:04.529 --> 26:05.096
YOU CAN'T SEND THE COP UNIFORM

26:05.163 --> 26:08.533
TO A FARM UPSTATE.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.534
THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

26:09.601 --> 26:10.268
A COP'S GONNA BE A COP,

26:10.335 --> 26:10.869
NO MATTER WHAT WE DRESS THEM

26:10.936 --> 26:11.403
UP IN.

26:11.469 --> 26:11.937
FUSCHIA?

26:12.003 --> 26:12.537
STILL A COP.

26:12.604 --> 26:13.371
VERMILLION?

26:13.438 --> 26:14.039
STILL A COP.

26:14.105 --> 26:14.706
CHER'S DRESS FROM THE 1986

26:14.773 --> 26:15.573
OSCARS?

26:15.640 --> 26:16.908
STILL A COP.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.743
NOW THEY'RE WEARING SOMETHING

26:18.810 --> 26:19.411
THEY COULDN'T PULL OFF IN THEIR

26:19.477 --> 26:21.446
WILDEST FUCKING DREAMS.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.214
THERE ARE SOME SLIGHTLY BIGGER

26:23.281 --> 26:24.916
STEPS WE COULD TAKE, LIKE

26:24.983 --> 26:25.917
DEMANDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADOPT

26:25.984 --> 26:27.185
RULES THAT KEEP COPS OUT OF

26:27.252 --> 26:28.653
ROUTINE STUDENT DISCIPLINE.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.055
WE COULD ALSO REQUIRE THEY HAVE

26:30.121 --> 26:30.922
COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING THAT

26:30.989 --> 26:31.890
INCLUDES DE-ESCALATION AND

26:31.957 --> 26:32.824
WORKING WITH STUDENTS WITH

26:32.891 --> 26:35.226
DISABILITIES.

26:35.293 --> 26:36.594
OR WE COULD JUST TRY AND GET

26:36.661 --> 26:41.800
THEM OUT OF SCHOOLS ALTOGETHER.

26:41.866 --> 26:42.334
SOME CITIES, LIKE OAKLAND,

26:42.400 --> 26:42.934
CALIFORNIA, HAVE DONE THAT.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.069
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S SIMPLE.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.236
THERE'S STILL A THOUGHTFUL,

26:45.303 --> 26:47.205
ONGOING CONVERSATION THERE ABOUT

26:47.272 --> 26:48.707
HOW TO HANDLE EVERYTHING FROM

26:48.773 --> 26:49.507
ROUTINE DISCIPLINE TO EMERGENCY

26:49.574 --> 26:51.309
SITUATIONS.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.944
BECAUSE THEY KNOW GETTING RID

26:53.011 --> 26:54.779
OF SCHOOL POLICE DOESN'T MEAN

26:54.846 --> 26:57.882
WALKING AWAY FROM SCHOOL SAFETY.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.017
WHAT IT MEANS IS ASKING

26:59.084 --> 27:00.251
OURSELVES WHAT REALLY KEEPS KIDS

27:00.318 --> 27:01.653
SAFE.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.488
AND I'D ARGUE ONE GOOD WAY TO DO

27:03.555 --> 27:04.856
THAT MIGHT BE TO TAKE THE MONEY

27:04.923 --> 27:06.224
THAT IT SEEMS WE'RE NOW

27:06.291 --> 27:08.960
INEVITABLY ABOUT TO FLOOD TOWARD

27:09.027 --> 27:10.328
SCHOOL COPS, AND INSTEAD, DIRECT

27:10.395 --> 27:11.796
IT TOWARD COUNSELORS, NURSES,

27:11.863 --> 27:12.931
AND ALL THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT

27:12.998 --> 27:14.766
ACTUALLY PROTECT STUDENTS.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.835
SCHOOL POLICE AREN'T THE ANSWER

27:16.901 --> 27:21.940
TO SCHOOL SHOOTINGS.

27:22.007 --> 27:22.941
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS GUN

27:23.008 --> 27:24.275
CONTROL.

27:24.342 --> 27:26.011
AND WHEN WE THROW MORE COPS INTO

27:26.077 --> 27:27.112
SCHOOLS, AS AN EASY WAY OUT OF

27:27.178 --> 27:28.313
THAT DIFFICULT AND NECESSARY

27:28.380 --> 27:29.914
CONVERSATION, WE NOT ONLY FAIL

27:29.981 --> 27:31.049
TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE FROM GUN

27:31.116 --> 27:32.717
VIOLENCE, WE CONDEMN THEM TO A

27:32.784 --> 27:33.852
SYSTEM THAT CRIMINALIZES THE

27:33.918 --> 27:36.287
VERY ESSENCE OF CHILDHOOD.

27:36.354 --> 27:40.191
KIDS DESERVE TO BE ANNOYING

27:40.258 --> 27:40.859
WITHOUT BEING ARRESTED.

27:40.925 --> 27:46.364
TO BE SAD AND ANGRY WITHOUT

27:46.431 --> 27:48.433
BEING BODY SLAMMED.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.034
THEY DESERVE TO HAVE TANTRUMS,

27:49.100 --> 27:49.567
THROW CARROTS, DO SCIENCE

27:49.634 --> 27:50.602
EXPERIMENTS, TALK SHIT AND CARVE

27:50.668 --> 27:52.037
THEIR NAME INTO STUFF WITHOUT

27:52.103 --> 27:52.670
RISKING ENDING UP IN THE BACK OF

27:52.737 --> 27:54.172
A POLICE CAR.

27:54.239 --> 27:54.973
THEY DESERVE TO BE CURIOUS,

27:55.040 --> 27:56.741
TO MAKE MISTAKES, TO GO A LITTLE

27:56.808 --> 27:57.609
TOO FAR, TO BE A LITTLE TOO

27:57.675 --> 27:59.377
LOUD.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.679
TO BASICALLY BE A FUCKING KID.

28:01.746 --> 28:03.415
AND THEY DEFINITELY DESERVE

28:03.481 --> 28:05.116
BETTER THAN THE FUNDAMENTAL LIE

28:05.183 --> 28:06.918
THAT THE ONLY THING THAT CAN

28:06.985 --> 28:08.753
STOP A BAD GUY WITH A GUN

28:08.820 --> 28:10.055
IS A GOOD GUY WHO CAN ARREST

28:10.121 --> 28:11.790
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

28:11.856 --> 28:17.729
AND NOW THIS.

28:17.796 --> 28:19.364
>> Announcer: AND NOW PEOPLE

28:19.431 --> 28:22.233
ON TV GET A LITTLE TOO BRITISH

28:22.300 --> 28:24.169
FOR THE PLATINUM JUBILEE.

>> WELCOME BACK TO FOX 5 NEWS

28:27.472 --> 28:29.140

28:29.207 --> 28:31.409
I AM YOUR BRITISH CORRESPONDENT

28:31.476 --> 28:32.177
KEN SMITH.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.179
>> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

28:34.245 --> 28:37.182
OR SHOULD I SAY CHEERIO, YOU

28:37.248 --> 28:38.783
CHAPS.

28:38.850 --> 28:39.918
>> CHEERIO.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.119
>> CHEERIO.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.587
>> HELLO.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.822
HELLO, GOVERNOR.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.290
>> ACROSS THE POND.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.158
SPEAK WE HAVE TO MAKE HER

28:47.225 --> 28:49.360
POSTURE IS GOOD.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.530
CELEBRATE THE QUEEN.

28:52.597 --> 28:52.964
>> PLATINUM JUBILEE.

28:53.031 --> 28:53.465
>> PLATINUM JUBILEE.

28:53.531 --> 28:59.737
>> W WILL WE READ THE NEWS IN AN

28:59.804 --> 28:59.971
ACCENT?

29:00.038 --> 29:02.373
>> I'VE BEEN USING AN ACCENT ALL

29:02.440 --> 29:02.941
MORNING.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.375
>> THE QUEEN.

29:04.442 --> 29:05.343
HER CELEBRATIONS.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.478
I'M NOT THE BEST.

29:06.544 --> 29:09.380
>> A FOR EFFORT.

29:09.447 --> 29:12.784
>> THAT'S LIKE MRS. DOUBTFIRE?

29:12.851 --> 29:13.718
>> HELLO!

29:13.785 --> 29:14.686
>> MRS. DOUBTFIRE.

29:14.752 --> 29:17.355
>> DO THE REST OF THE SHOW IN A

29:17.422 --> 29:18.289
BRITISH ACCENT.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.958
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.392
>> QUESTIONS WHETHER SHE WILL BE

29:21.459 --> 29:24.028
ABLE TO ATTEND HER OWN

29:24.095 --> 29:24.562
CELEBRATION?

29:24.629 --> 29:24.963
>> WHY?

29:25.029 --> 29:26.865
>> IT'S BECAUSE OF HEALTH

29:26.931 --> 29:30.001
ISSUES, SO I'M GOING TO DROP THE

29:30.068 --> 29:32.904
ACCIDENT.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.139
>> John: MOVING ON.

29:34.205 --> 29:34.806
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN

29:34.873 --> 29:35.707
A GRIM COUPLE OF WEEKS, SO

29:35.773 --> 29:38.643
BEFORE WE LEAVE, WE WANTED TO

29:38.710 --> 29:39.711
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING JUST FUN.

29:39.777 --> 29:40.545
SPECIFICALLY: BANANAS.

29:40.612 --> 29:40.979
THE VERY WORST PART

29:41.045 --> 29:42.213
OF A BANANA SPLIT.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.081
AND THE REASON IS, THERE'S

29:43.148 --> 29:44.382
ACTUALLY SOME URGENT, BREAKING

29:44.449 --> 29:45.917
NEWS ABOUT BANANAS.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.719
WELL, TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT

29:47.785 --> 29:48.953
REALLY URGENT OR BREAKING --

29:49.020 --> 29:49.787
THIS HAPPENED LAST NOVEMBER.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.089
IT'S BARELY EVEN NEWS.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.557
BUT IT IS SOMETHING I WANT TO

29:52.624 --> 29:55.093
SHOW YOU, MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S

29:55.160 --> 29:56.060
SIMPLY AMAZING.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.162
>> VANDALS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

29:57.228 --> 29:59.364
SEVER THE TOP OF A CONTROVERSIAL

29:59.430 --> 30:00.632
BANANA AND SKULL SCULPTURE

30:00.698 --> 30:01.933
IN FITZROY.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.568
>> THE VANDAL APPEARED OUT OF

30:03.635 --> 30:04.869
NOWHERE LAST NIGHT, CONCEALING

30:04.936 --> 30:06.538
HIS IDENTITY, HIS MOTIVE

30:06.604 --> 30:11.276
UNKNOWN.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.878
>> John: YEAH.

30:13.945 --> 30:14.846
THAT HAPPENED.

30:14.913 --> 30:15.647
A GIANT AUSTRALIAN BANANA IN A

30:15.713 --> 30:16.748
MELBOURNE SUBURB WAS VANDALIZED

30:16.814 --> 30:17.148
WITH A SAW.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.416
AND BY THE WAY -- WHAT A BANANA!

30:18.483 --> 30:19.184
IT'S BASICALLY THE CATE

30:19.250 --> 30:20.852
BLANCHETT OF BANANA SCULPTURES,

30:20.919 --> 30:22.453
IN THAT IT'S A HAUNTINGLY PALE

30:22.520 --> 30:24.322
AUSTRALIAN CREATURE WITH A VERY

30:24.389 --> 30:25.657
STRIKING BONE STRUCTURE.

30:25.723 --> 30:27.458
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHO

30:27.525 --> 30:28.660
WOULD DO A THING LIKE THIS, IT

30:28.726 --> 30:31.262
TURNS OUT, A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE

30:31.329 --> 30:32.530
HAD A MOTIVE BECAUSE THE BANANA

30:32.597 --> 30:34.632
WAS NOT UNIVERSALLY BELOVED.

30:34.699 --> 30:37.302
>> THE CONTROVERSIAL $22,000

30:37.368 --> 30:39.470
WORK HIGHLIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE

30:39.537 --> 30:41.839
WAS FUNDED BY THE TAC,

30:41.906 --> 30:43.975
PART OF A COUNCIL PROJECT TO

30:44.042 --> 30:46.044
SLOW LOCAL TRAFFIC.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.613
>> EVEN IN QUIRKY FITZROY,

30:48.680 --> 30:52.984
THIS BANANA SPLIT LOCAL OPINION.

30:53.051 --> 30:53.518
>> BRIGHTENS UP THE PLACE.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.352
IT LOOKS GOOD.

30:54.419 --> 30:55.587
>> I THINK OUR MONEY CAN BE

30:55.653 --> 30:57.555
SPENT A LOT WISER.

30:57.622 --> 30:58.156
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO

30:58.223 --> 30:58.856
REPRESENT?

30:58.923 --> 31:00.792
COULD YOU TELL ME?

31:00.858 --> 31:02.060
>> John: YEAH, PEOPLE WERE

31:02.126 --> 31:04.095
PISSED OFF WITH THAT BANANA.

31:04.162 --> 31:04.662
AND IT'S TRUE.

31:04.729 --> 31:05.830
THE AIM OF THE SCULPTURE

31:05.897 --> 31:06.631
WAS THAT IT WOULD REMIND

31:06.698 --> 31:07.532
THE COMMUNITY ABOUT ROAD SAFETY

31:07.599 --> 31:08.433
BY FORCING PEOPLE

31:08.499 --> 31:10.435
TO SLOW DOWN.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.070
ALTHOUGH I'D ARGUE THAT THIS IS

31:12.136 --> 31:12.937
LESS OF A REMINDER TO SLOW DOWN,

31:13.004 --> 31:14.272
AND MORE AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO

31:14.339 --> 31:16.975
SPEED UP IN ORDER TO GET AWAY

31:17.041 --> 31:17.609
FROM THIS DEMONIC BANANA AS SOON

31:17.675 --> 31:22.647
AS POSSIBLE.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.648
BUT AS FOR THIS WOMAN'S

31:23.715 --> 31:24.449
QUESTION, "WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED

31:24.515 --> 31:24.782
TO REPRESENT?"

31:24.849 --> 31:25.450
WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP ANSWER THAT

31:25.516 --> 31:32.523
FOR YOU.

31:32.590 --> 31:37.528
>> THE TITLE IS FALLEN FRUIT.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.297
>> CONFIDENCE WITHIN WESTERN

31:39.364 --> 31:41.132
SOCIETY AND THE WAY WE'VE BEEN

31:41.199 --> 31:43.134
DRAWN TOWARDS UNSUSTAINABLE

31:43.201 --> 31:45.470
ACCESS.

31:45.536 --> 31:46.671
>> John: WOW, YEAH, THAT IS NOT

31:46.738 --> 31:47.805
THE STATEMENT I THOUGHT THAT

31:47.872 --> 31:48.439
BANANA WAS MAKING!

31:48.506 --> 31:49.140
THE STATEMENT I THOUGHT IT WAS

31:49.207 --> 31:51.242
MAKING IS:

31:51.309 --> 31:52.176
I AM A BIG WEIRD BANANA.

31:52.243 --> 31:52.777
SO I WAS CLEARLY WAY OFF HERE.

31:52.844 --> 31:53.811
NOW, SADLY, THE BANANA WAS

31:53.878 --> 31:54.479
REMOVED AFTER THE VANDALISM, AND

31:54.545 --> 31:55.680
WAS RECENTLY REPLACED BY THIS

31:55.747 --> 31:58.082
GIANT YELLOW FLOWER POT, WHICH

31:58.149 --> 32:01.286
IS CLEARLY NOT AS GOOD.

32:01.352 --> 32:02.787
AND APPARENTLY, THERE'S NOW NO

32:02.854 --> 32:04.155
SIGN OF WHETHER THE BANANA WILL

32:04.222 --> 32:04.989
EVER BE BACK.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.457
WHICH IS A HUGE SHAME.

32:06.524 --> 32:07.091
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM

32:07.158 --> 32:07.792
HERE?

32:07.859 --> 32:10.962
IT'S NOT LIKE AUSTRALIA ISN'T

32:11.029 --> 32:11.729
FULL OF RIDICULOUS ENORMOUS

32:11.796 --> 32:12.664
STATUES.

32:12.730 --> 32:13.665
THERE'S A PROUD TRADITION

32:13.731 --> 32:15.066
OF AUSTRALIAN BIG THINGS:

32:15.133 --> 32:16.734
GIGANTIC SCULPTURES OF

32:16.801 --> 32:19.070
COMMON OBJECTS, LIKE THE BIG

32:19.137 --> 32:20.571
BANANA, WHICH DEMONSTRABLY LIVES

32:20.638 --> 32:24.208
UP TO ITS NAME;

32:24.275 --> 32:24.842
THIS GIANT KOALA BEAR, WHO LOOKS

32:24.909 --> 32:27.278
ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED;

32:27.345 --> 32:28.813
AND THIS MASSIVE CROCODILE WITH

32:28.880 --> 32:30.515
BOXING GLOVES WHOSE ROLE IS TO

32:30.581 --> 32:34.018
ENTICE TOURISTS TO VISIT THE

32:34.085 --> 32:35.953
VERY REAL TOWN OF HUMPTY DOO,

32:36.020 --> 32:37.255
A STATEMENT SO OFFENSIVELY

32:37.322 --> 32:38.523
AUSTRALIAN THAT, IF IT WEREN'T

32:38.589 --> 32:39.524
TRUE, IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

32:39.590 --> 32:41.225
RACIST.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.427
BUT SINCE THE CITIZENS OF

32:42.493 --> 32:43.528
MELBOURNE SEEM TO THINK THAT

32:43.594 --> 32:45.129
THEIR MONEY'S BEEN WASTED,

32:45.196 --> 32:47.498
I MIGHT HAVE A SOLUTION.

32:47.565 --> 32:48.700
I WILL GLADLY TAKE THAT BANANA

32:48.766 --> 32:50.802
OFF YOUR HANDS.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.303
WE'VE LONG HAD AN INTEREST IN

32:52.370 --> 32:53.304
AUSTRALIAN ARTIFACTS ON THIS

32:53.371 --> 32:54.505
SHOW.

32:54.572 --> 32:55.373
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT WE BOUGHT

32:55.440 --> 32:57.075
RUSSELL CROWE'S JOCKSTRAP FROM

32:57.141 --> 32:58.843
THE MOVIE "CINDERELLA MAN,"

32:58.910 --> 33:00.378
AT HIS DIVORCE AUCTION,

33:00.445 --> 33:01.346
INADVERTENTLY FUNDING

33:01.412 --> 33:02.413
THE JOHN OLIVER KOALA

33:02.480 --> 33:03.514
CHLAMYDIA WARD AT

33:03.581 --> 33:08.519
THE AUSTRALIA ZOO.

33:08.586 --> 33:11.956
I PROMISE IT MADE SENSE

33:12.023 --> 33:12.957
AT THE TIME.

33:13.024 --> 33:13.925
IT ALL MADE SENSE AT THE TIME.

33:13.991 --> 33:14.726
THE POINT IS, MELBOURNE, I'M

33:14.792 --> 33:15.693
WILLING TO BUY THAT GIANT BANANA

33:15.760 --> 33:16.194
OFF YOU FOR EXACTLY TEN

33:16.260 --> 33:16.728
AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS

33:16.794 --> 33:17.862

33:17.929 --> 33:19.731
LOCAL FOOD BANK AND $5,000

33:19.797 --> 33:21.165
TO HELP FURTHER FUND THE KOALA

33:21.232 --> 33:22.200
CHLAMYDIA WARD.

33:22.266 --> 33:24.402
BUT WAIT.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.470
WAIT, I'M NOT DONE.

33:25.536 --> 33:26.838
BECAUSE YOU MAY ALSO REMEMBER

33:26.904 --> 33:28.873
THAT WE, TOO, HAVE A STATUE OF A

33:28.940 --> 33:30.908
LARGE, BELLIGERENT REPTILE --

33:30.975 --> 33:31.642

33:31.709 --> 33:32.543
FINGER -- THAT WE MADE FOR OUR

33:32.610 --> 33:33.845
CONFEDERACY SHOW.

33:33.911 --> 33:35.780
IT'S BEEN SITTING IN OUR

33:35.847 --> 33:36.914
OFFICES, POINTED DIRECTLY AT

33:36.981 --> 33:39.283
DR. OZ'S OFFICES, SO IT COULD

33:39.350 --> 33:40.618
TELL HIM TO GO FUCK HIMSELF

33:40.685 --> 33:43.488
WHEN HE CAME TO WORK EVERY DAY.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.989
BUT AS HE'S NOW GONE, AND AS OF

33:45.056 --> 33:46.190
THIS WEEK, IS THE OFFICIAL

33:46.257 --> 33:47.792
REPUBLICAN SENATE NOMINEE IN

33:47.859 --> 33:49.360
PENNSYLVANIA, WE DON'T REALLY

33:49.427 --> 33:51.896
NEED OUR ALLIGATOR ANYMORE.

33:51.963 --> 33:52.997

33:54.098 --> 33:55.800

34:12.350 --> 34:12.984
RIGHT IN THERE.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.420
WHAT COULD BE MORE AUSTRALIAN

34:15.486 --> 34:16.854
THAN A DANGEROUS ANIMAL TELLING

34:16.921 --> 34:18.122
ANYONE WHO COMES NEAR IT TO GO

FUCK THEMSELVES?
