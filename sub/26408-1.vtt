WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:04.554
Previously onSEAL Team...RAY:
My shoulder wasn't messed up,

00:04.610 --> 00:06.953
that boy would still be alive. JASON:
You lied to me, Ray.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.468
You lied to the team,
put us all at risk.

00:09.530 --> 00:10.656
Yes, I did.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.133
You're gonna go, uh,
teach a Green Team

00:12.180 --> 00:13.397
while you're rehabbing.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.611
FINLEY: I would definitely say
you've got a concussion.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.310
And you remember
the whole incident?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.951
Bravo 2.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.170
You'll be taking us to target.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.482
Roger that.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.612
Don't get us lost, Blondie.

02:41.420 --> 02:44.719
Havoc, this is 1. I'm passing
Hextall. How copy?

02:47.030 --> 02:50.591
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Good copy.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.517
CLAY: Target building's
the northern structure.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.859
Path clear?

02:58.780 --> 03:00.600
Creepers lingering
on target.
Take it.

03:00.650 --> 03:02.789
Time to wake up
the neighborhood.

03:34.300 --> 03:38.646
Hey. We're here
to take you home.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.646
I got this, Jace.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.861
I got this. Hey.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.047
Havoc, this is 1.
Jackpot.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.045
Get up now.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.648
ERIC:
Good copy, 1.

03:49.700 --> 03:50.871
Let's go, boys. Let's go home.

03:50.920 --> 03:51.966
Exfil, exfil.Come on.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.568
TRENT:
Got hostiles moving on us.

03:53.620 --> 03:54.780
CLAY:
Move.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.660
Looks like the end of the line.

04:11.590 --> 04:12.852
All right.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.289
End ex.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.819
Every one of you
pencil pushers

04:16.860 --> 04:18.634
better be checking off
that "perfect" box.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.726
Yeah, we'll debrief when
we get back to the base.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.259
CLAY:
Come on, Blackburn.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.121
Come on, at least tell us
how we did. Let's go.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.122
You crushed it.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.307
We're back.

04:30.350 --> 04:33.262
So back.

04:55.070 --> 04:56.628
Navy spent millions on you,

04:56.680 --> 04:58.500
but a coffeemaker stops
you in your tracks.

04:58.550 --> 04:59.892
What are you talking about?
I mean, six months here

04:59.950 --> 05:01.599
and I still can't
figure this thing out.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.688
Must be a girl.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.334
There you go.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.334
I was just gonna
do that next.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.516
Yeah. Mm. Of
course you were.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.869
Right. Huh.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.127
You sleep well?

05:11.180 --> 05:12.693
Yeah. Well, you know what?

05:12.740 --> 05:14.344
Mikey had the buzz saw
going again.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.697
You know, the kid can snore,
let me tell you.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.399
So I ended up
on the couch again.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.830
I'm sorry you're still bunking
in his room.No worries.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.700
We should've bought
that, uh, bigger home.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.967
You know, the one
that you wanted?

05:24.010 --> 05:27.366
Not what I was talking about.Yeah, I know.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.141
Under the same roof,
but not sharing the same bed.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.419
It's not ideal, but hey, look,
you see me complaining?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.064
I'm not complaining.

05:36.110 --> 05:38.283
Rent is free

05:38.330 --> 05:40.241
and I get to see
the kids all the time.

05:40.290 --> 05:44.078
Yeah, well, they wanted
you here after the crash.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.078
They were scared. We all were.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.642
How'd it go last night?

05:53.700 --> 05:56.168
Great. Team's clicking.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.949
That's not what I meant.I know.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.083
It's... it's not my first
concussion, Alana.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.836
You collapsed in a restaurant.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.269
Doctor cleared me.
You were there.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.276
I was there.
I remember what she said.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.494
"Jason, we know so little about
traumatic brain injury..."

06:11.540 --> 06:12.791
Stop. No.
You know what?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.101
_ This conversation
IS starting to remind me

06:14.150 --> 06:15.492
of when we were married

06:15.540 --> 06:17.622
and we're not married,
but we're doing good,

06:17.680 --> 06:18.931
so you know what? Let's be good.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.767
I need a ride to school--
which, obviously,

06:21.810 --> 06:23.539
wouldn't be an issue
ifI had my own car.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.079
All right, you're complaining
about not having a car

06:25.120 --> 06:26.769
and I gotta sleep
in a Spider-Man bunk bed

06:26.820 --> 06:28.071
with your snoring brother.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.769
EMMA: Here's a vision,
for example.
JASON: Yeah.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.869
Dad wouldn't have to sleep in a
ten-year-old Spider-Man bunk bed

06:32.910 --> 06:35.470
if he rents _the
house on Pine.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.305
Either of you even
look at it yet?

06:39.350 --> 06:41.955
Um, you know what,
I tell you, I just, uh,

06:42.010 --> 06:43.819
I haven't gotten to it yet.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.223
Yeah, it's on my list
of things to do.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.659
Right. Avoidance much?

06:48.710 --> 06:51.099
Okay, let's go.
I'll take you to school. Okay?

06:51.140 --> 06:53.313
Love you.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.531
This toast's for you.Good day.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.844
Juice.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.543
I'll keep that for you.Oh, thank you.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.932
Yeah.

07:04.980 --> 07:07.289
No.You almost had me that time.

07:07.330 --> 07:08.888
You cheated, Clay.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.372
How do you
cheat at running?
Cheated.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.465
You... how do you
cheat at running?

07:11.510 --> 07:12.989
You elbowed me
three times.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.849
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, and then
you cut me off...

07:14.910 --> 07:17.128
No, that's not cheating....like, three other times.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.683
No, no, no,
that's strategy.

07:18.740 --> 07:19.866
That's not cheating.Oh, is that what it is?

07:19.910 --> 07:21.639
Yes.Oh, really?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.918
Look, maybe you'll get luclq.
Maybe you'll get me tomorrow.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.611
Oh. Well, in that case, maybe
you won't get me tonight.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.821
Wait a second.
What?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.780
Hold on.
Yes?

07:30.840 --> 07:32.319
You know what?
What?

07:32.360 --> 07:34.089
I'm gonna
disqualify myself.
Uh-huh.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.698
I lost. You won.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.492
You're a sensible
man, after all.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.270
Hey, don't forget
that we have dinner

07:41.330 --> 07:43.059
with Polly and Chris tonight.

07:43.110 --> 07:47.934
Yeah, yeah. And, uh, brunch with
Pete and Lacey on Saturday.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.722
Cocktails at Professor
Kilborn's on Tuesday.
Uh-huh.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.818
You realize that _most of
my braInpower IS In charge

07:52.860 --> 07:54.282
of keeping track
of your social calendar?

07:54.340 --> 07:56.774
I'm just taking advantage
while you're still around.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.947
Sorry.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.639
Kabul. 2012.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.909
Bravo performed a hit on an HVT
and ran into something

08:04.960 --> 08:06.734
no one had ever
encountered before:

08:06.790 --> 08:10.044
a sandbagged position
concealing a PKM.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.968
I don't know about y'all,
but a big-ass machine gun

08:13.010 --> 08:15.092
is the last thing I want
greeting me when I enter a room.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.877
Evolution.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.888
After a period
of kicking down doors,

08:21.930 --> 08:24.239
the enemy countered
our approach.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.407
Now, why am I
sharing this, Benzo?

08:26.460 --> 08:28.712
So we don't get
our nuts shot off?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.933
Partly.

08:30.980 --> 08:34.507
But the point of the story
is the point of Green Team.

08:34.550 --> 08:37.075
It is to get you
to expand your thinking.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.771
The enemy adapts to us.
We've got to adapt to them.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.254
And most often, a split
second is all you got.

08:42.300 --> 08:43.813
So how did we adapt?

08:43.870 --> 08:45.076
We started coming
in from the roof,

08:45.130 --> 08:46.995
from the floor, the walls.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.782
Hit them hard from everywhere
and send them on to their maker.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.650
All right, get jocked up
and meet me

08:51.700 --> 08:53.395
in the shoot house in five.
Let's go!

08:53.440 --> 08:55.567
Sir.
Sir.
You heard him.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.043
They love you, Ray.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.056
Yeah, after a year here,
I've never seen anybody

09:00.100 --> 09:02.091
take to instructing
the way you have.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.924
Yeah, no offense, Adam,

09:03.970 --> 09:07.883
but I hope I'm not
looking at a year of this.

09:07.930 --> 09:09.841
ADAM:
It matters, Ray.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.369
Teaching the guys who'll
be fighting in the field

09:11.420 --> 09:13.229
to be better, smarter.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.679
It's tough to imagine
not doing this.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.110
Yeah. Tough to imagine.

09:27.690 --> 09:30.079
Get up.

09:30.130 --> 09:32.030
Ugh.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.955
Davis.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.729
You know you must be
some kind of VIP

09:35.790 --> 09:38.350
if the strip club has
your emergency contact info.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.709
Oh, trust me,
it-it ain't cheap.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.092
I thought the idea was that

09:45.140 --> 09:46.789
the strippers
take off theirclothes.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.663
Yeah, you keep up the partying,

09:51.720 --> 09:54.063
you're gonna be
what we call unemployed.Oh, yeah?

09:54.110 --> 09:58.979
"All in, all the time" doesn't
just apply to trigger pulling.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.759
Listen to me. I know
that the downtime

10:00.810 --> 10:02.289
gets you a little
bit stir crazy...
Mm-hmm.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.637
...but you've been pressing
the red harder than usual.

10:03.690 --> 10:08.115
And all without
my right-hand woman.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.035
Still don't understand
why you grounded yourself.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.738
Something you want to tell me?Yeah.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.862
That you're about one G-string
shy of an intervention,

10:15.910 --> 10:18.993
so let's go, Magic Mike.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.967
Sonny has landed.

10:24.010 --> 10:27.662
The War on Terror
continues, boys.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.189
Dude, you reek.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.926
That is the aroma
of champions, okay?

10:31.970 --> 10:34.882
Two parts whiskey, one part
Brittany's cheap perfume.

10:34.930 --> 10:36.978
You ever take
a night off, Sonny?

10:37.020 --> 10:40.194
SONNY: Well, some of us like
more action than Crock-Potting

10:40.240 --> 10:43.368
and Parcheesi
with Lady Professor.

10:43.420 --> 10:44.762
CLAY: What was
with last night?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.199
You running back to help Jason
with that pilot?

10:47.250 --> 10:50.037
Jason's our team_ leader
and he called It In.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.685
Look, that door was
an open threat, man.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.550
You know, some mudsucker
could've got the drop on us.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.998
SONNY: All right,
listen, wonder boy,

10:56.040 --> 10:58.736
we're playing paintball,
not hunting Talimonsters.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.179
And because you
seem to have forgot

11:00.220 --> 11:01.699
that Jason got his bell
rung not too far back,

11:01.740 --> 11:04.208
maybe I was a
little reactive.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.044
Jason's squared away, okay?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.704
Not trusting that
is gonna lead to mistakes.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.876
I do trust that.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.876
I don't take
kindly, though,

11:10.930 --> 11:13.444
to lectures
before breakfast.Okay.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.629
Just trying to tell you, man.
It just could've been,

11:15.670 --> 11:17.103
you know, a little cleaner,
that's all.

11:17.150 --> 11:18.276
Oh, I agree.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.106
Bravo hasn't fired
on all cylinders

11:20.150 --> 11:22.106
since we lost our number two.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.809
All right,

11:24.850 --> 11:26.898
who wants to get in the ring
with me and throw hands?

11:26.940 --> 11:28.635
You ready to turn those
show muscles into go muscles?

11:28.680 --> 11:30.409
Shoulder's 100%.Mm.

11:30.470 --> 11:32.028
Which I can't say
for your breath, Sonny. Damn.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.241
Training cycle got you
crawling the walls again?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.518
You know it. The
whole world's on fire,

11:36.560 --> 11:38.687
and we're sitting around here
playing capture the flag.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.129
Hey, Ray,
when you coming back?

11:41.170 --> 11:43.081
Ball's not in my court.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.301
Hey, Ray.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.823
Jason.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.780
How are the wife and kids?

11:49.830 --> 11:53.652
Um, little man took his
first steps the other day.

11:53.710 --> 11:54.927
That's great.

11:54.970 --> 11:56.665
Special time.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.837
You know what?
Good that you're around.

11:58.890 --> 12:01.188
Yeah.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.936
Say, uh, look, Jace, I wanted
to talk to you about, um...

12:06.550 --> 12:08.450
Well, loolq, looky.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.375
It is about damn time.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.678
All right, bro. Got to go.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.209
All right, let's go.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.206
Come on.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.775
Hey, Sonny. Stay there.
Wash up. You smell.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.288
SONNY:
Roger that.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.786
Someone forget to call Mandy?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.263
Agent Ellis
is out of the country

12:29.310 --> 12:31.039
building a target package.

12:31.090 --> 12:32.785
Please don't tell us
you brought us In here

12:32.830 --> 12:34.969
to go over Miss Mandy's
travel itinerary.

12:35.010 --> 12:37.877
No. There's a situation
spinning up

12:37.930 --> 12:40.057
in the Gulf of Guinea.
Keywood Rochelle.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.399
It's an American oil platform
off the Nigerian coast.

12:43.450 --> 12:45.532
It's been overtaken
by armed militants.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.058
SONNY: GOPLAT takedown.
Hell yeah.

12:48.110 --> 12:50.806
That is the white whale
of Special Operations.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.715
So, let me guess,
Americans on board?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.544
Is that why we're handling this?Yeah, American crew

12:54.590 --> 12:55.807
on board.
Okay.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.669
Two were killed
during the initial assault.

12:57.730 --> 12:59.686
Right. Who's
behind this?

12:59.730 --> 13:03.075
An upstart group. It's called
the Delta Resistance Army.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.075
Uh, right, okay.
What's the ransom?

13:05.130 --> 13:07.257
Doesn't appear
ransom is the motive.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.439
Sig-Intel indicates
three smaller tankers

13:09.480 --> 13:10.435
steaming their way.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.651
Look, small or not,

13:11.700 --> 13:13.565
a tanker loaded with oil,
that's, what,

13:13.610 --> 13:15.566
at least $40 million
on the open market?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.269
Is this some kind of oil heist?

13:17.310 --> 13:19.778
In part.
Their communications indicate

13:19.840 --> 13:22.798
the militants have rigged
the platform with explosives.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.888
Analysts think
it's a coming-out party.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.886
JASON: Steal millions
in oil, fund up,

13:26.930 --> 13:28.579
kill some
Americans, and...

13:28.630 --> 13:30.586
blow off an offshore oil rig

13:30.630 --> 13:32.541
just to announce yourself
to the world.

13:32.590 --> 13:33.716
So, rescue the hostages

13:33.760 --> 13:34.715
and prevent
an environmental disaster?

13:34.770 --> 13:35.759
Just another day
at the office, boys.

13:41.860 --> 13:44.112
The platform is 12 stories high
and 80 million square feet.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.730
And we got to find the
hostages in all that space

13:46.780 --> 13:47.997
before the baddies
find we're there

13:48.040 --> 13:49.598
and turn us
into fish food.

13:49.650 --> 13:50.958
I'm sorry, but does
every death fantasy of yours

13:51.000 --> 13:53.036
turn out to be a_shark meal?
Just curious.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.739
No.

13:55.740 --> 13:57.082
Maybe.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.301
Yeah, maybe.
Okay, infil ideas?

13:59.360 --> 14:01.225
Platfo_rm's inside
of commercral trawling lanes.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.703
Go ahead.
So I think

14:02.750 --> 14:03.830
we infil on some fishing boats,

14:03.880 --> 14:04.960
maybe gets us
within a few klicks

14:05.010 --> 14:06.272
without raising any eyebrows.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.537
All right.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.059
Davis, trawlers?Already have 'em.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.271
ERIC:
It's wet season there now.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.880
Talking about large swells,
low visibility.

14:12.930 --> 14:14.067
Too rough for a swim?

14:14.110 --> 14:15.190
Please, Lord.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.195
Too rough.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.891
I tell you what,
low viz at night--

14:18.940 --> 14:20.328
I say we go in on RHIBs.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.725
Yeah. Infil directly beneath
the beast, right?

14:23.770 --> 14:25.249
I can lead climb one
of these stanchions,

14:25.290 --> 14:26.894
drop a |adder.All right, so we're gonna need

14:26.950 --> 14:29.646
an EOD, uh, specialist
to defuse the bombs.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.123
Well, speaking of...

14:32.950 --> 14:35.566
Gentlemen,
this is our new explosives

14:35.610 --> 14:37.862
ordnance disposal
specialist.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.909
Courtesy

14:38.960 --> 14:41.656
of the US. Naw:
Summer Kairos.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.304
You know, I'm gonna
go out on a limb here

14:43.360 --> 14:45.965
and guessing
you're not from Texas.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.352
California.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.482
Okay, Davis,
where we at with the ISR?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.189
The bird's gonna launch out
of Djibouti.

14:51.230 --> 14:54.108
It should be over the platform
by the time we're on the C-17.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.543
The drone can only be over
the target until sunrise.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.194
Well, tell you what, we'll
be long gone by then, right?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.969
Right.

15:03.030 --> 15:04.110
All right.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.242
Wheels up in two hours.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.372
Got any business to handle,
now's the time.

15:14.950 --> 15:16.383
You're home early.Yeah, passport.

15:16.430 --> 15:17.385
Been so long, I, uh,

15:17.430 --> 15:19.159
forgot it wasn't
in my cage.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.643
You left all three here?

15:23.090 --> 15:26.048
Wait, are you spinning up?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.609
Seems kind of soon.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.218
Crash was only six months ago.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.612
I'm not worried.

15:33.670 --> 15:37.185
Which is whyI have
to worry for you.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.886
I'm late for a client.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.271
Yeah.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.719
Look, Alana, hey.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.764
I'll see you when I get back.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.295
STELLA: You don't know
when you'll be back?

15:57.340 --> 15:59.160
No, it's just a little spin up.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.996
Shouldn't be too long.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.088
But you don't know?

16:03.130 --> 16:06.429
Okay, so I guess I'll cancel
dinner at Professor Kilborn's.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.301
Well, it might be for the best
anyway.

16:09.350 --> 16:11.306
I was probably gonna end up
shooting her husband.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.260
That's not funny.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.312
It's just that
this scares me,

16:16.360 --> 16:19.181
and you making jokes
is not helpful.

16:19.230 --> 16:21.539
That's not how
it's going to be, okay?

16:21.580 --> 16:24.140
I'm a big girl.
I can handle your job.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.622
I can live being afraid for you.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.285
I just need you to take my fear
seriously, please.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.116
Hey, boss, you
got a minute?

16:38.170 --> 16:40.161
What's on your mind, Ray?

16:40.210 --> 16:42.553
_ Six months I've been
Instructing at Green Team now.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.419
Yeah. From what I'm hearing,
you're one hell of a teacher.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.996
Just passing on knowledge
that was passed on to me.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.177
Yeah.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.348
Look, I should've told
you about the shoulder.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.652
I put you in a tough spot.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.575
But it's time
I'm reinstated.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.315
I don't know, Ray.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.271
Might disrupt the whole flow
of the team.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.619
You're worried about how
I'd mesh with my own team?

17:04.670 --> 17:06.103
Come on, look.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.106
Jason, I lied and I'm sorry.

17:08.150 --> 17:10.846
But-but how's it _so different
from you misleading a doctor

17:10.890 --> 17:12.846
about the extent
of your concussron?

17:12.900 --> 17:16.279
Huh. Sorry, that
a serious question, Ray?

17:16.330 --> 17:18.332
Dead serious.Dead serious. Yeah?

17:18.380 --> 17:19.722
You lied to me.
That's how.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.988
And you're just gonna keep
punishing me for that--

17:22.040 --> 17:24.998
Someone died.
Someone died.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.996
This is not about me
punishing you.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.519
This is about me
not trusting you.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.118
Big difference, Ray.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.728
Well, how am I gonna earn back
that trust

17:31.780 --> 17:33.088
trapped in a damn classroom?

17:33.130 --> 17:35.690
Take care, Ray.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.786
Yeah, you got your
team waiting, right?

17:37.830 --> 17:39.092
Yep, yep-

17:39.140 --> 17:40.835
Your family.Yep.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.544
ISR spotted a skiff

17:57.590 --> 17:59.546
uploading six more fighters
onto the platform.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.149
Brings our total number of enemy
combatants to around a dozen.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.370
And confirmed

18:04.430 --> 18:06.512
an oil tanker
just left the platform.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.289
Pumping oil's way too
sophisticated for these guys.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.774
They're definitely making
the hostages do all the work.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.515
Well, that makes
our job even harder.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.778
I mean, some of these guys are
gonna be in the control room.

18:14.830 --> 18:17.606
But the others, who knows
where they're keeping 'em?JASON: Kairos, you're up.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.560
All right. Come on, swami guy.
Talk us through your deal.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.429
What do you do?ISR gave me

18:21.490 --> 18:22.741
_ a look at
theIr explosrves package.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.657
Looks like ten to 15 kilos
of Semtex per charge.

18:25.710 --> 18:26.927
It's a gnarly amount.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.574
Gnarly. Okay.
How long to defuse?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.497
If they're on the same
trip line, five minutes.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.792
If not, three minutes per,
once I find them.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.329
Pray it doesn't take long.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.144
Hippies pray?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.418
What, are we gonna hold hands
and light incense after?

18:38.460 --> 18:41.065
Good idea.
Maybe on the boat.Don't touch me.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.327
All right, let's revisit
the topic at a later time.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.109
It's gonna be
a long flight.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.377
Let's get some rest.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.329
Hey, Sonny,

18:51.390 --> 18:53.995
what you, uh--
what you said about the team

18:54.040 --> 18:57.305
not firing
on all cylinders,

18:57.350 --> 19:00.433
you really think that Bravo runs
better with Ray as number two?

19:00.480 --> 19:03.483
Listen, Clay, I'd kick
a hornets' nest with you

19:03.530 --> 19:05.486
any day, any time.

19:05.530 --> 19:07.316
But don't you forget--

19:07.360 --> 19:10.318
you are just keeping Ray's seat
warm until he gets back.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.531
You understand?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.196
Daddy!Ah, there's my baby girl.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.027
She already picked out her
bedtime book for you to read.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.628
Yeah? Let me guess.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.545
Goodnight Moon. How'd you know?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.669
It was a luclq guess.

19:30.510 --> 19:32.421
Go get ready for bed.
I'll be right in there.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.722
I love you being home, Daddy.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.697
What is it?

19:41.740 --> 19:43.822
Bravo got spun up.

19:43.870 --> 19:46.043
Rolled without me
for the first time.

19:46.090 --> 19:47.694
It stings.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.913
Maybe Jason comes home with
the knowledge that he needs you.

19:52.710 --> 19:55.315
I mean, bringing me back
after one mission,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.055
he'd be admitting
he made a mistake.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.148
Jason's a great friend, but...

19:59.190 --> 20:01.715
you can't keep putting
your future in his hands.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.457
He's team leader. I'm not gonna
operate again till he says so.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.196
Last I checked, there
are other teams at DEVGRU.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.416
What are you saying,

20:10.470 --> 20:12.279
I should transfer out of Bravo?

20:12.340 --> 20:14.558
That's exactly what I'm saying.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.556
You're waiting on Jason
to make a move.

20:16.600 --> 20:21.037
But... maybe God's waiting
for you to make one.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.797
You all right? You need
a Red Bull or something?

20:45.850 --> 20:48.239
You look a
little out of it.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.508
Especially considering what
we're about to head into.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.279
Out of it?

20:52.330 --> 20:54.241
I'm in it.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.590
Look, just, uh...

20:57.640 --> 21:00.165
just don't let us
get blown up, okay?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.865
All good.

21:06.130 --> 21:08.086
Look at you.
We're not even in the drink

21:08.130 --> 21:09.859
and you're rocking
your shark bracelet.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.480
Safe over sorry.

21:12.530 --> 21:15.784
You know
what really scares me, though?

21:15.830 --> 21:18.572
Being separated from my team.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.088
Being alone,

21:21.140 --> 21:25.236
cut away from the team,

21:25.280 --> 21:27.316
that's when the sharks,
they come get you.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.671
How's it look?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.504
No movement at the GOPLAT.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.551
Here's hoping the
Delta Resistance Army

21:42.600 --> 21:43.771
likes their sleep.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.550
Yeah, winds are pushing
opposite Bravo now.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.125
Losing time.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.129
Something
on your mind?

21:57.220 --> 21:59.836
I reapplied
to Officer Candidate School.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.929
Figured you should know.

22:02.970 --> 22:05.188
Okay.

22:05.230 --> 22:08.358
Didn't expect that after you
opted not to go last year.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.971
Well, that's the thing,
you know.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.932
Bravo is family.
Right.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.631
But that ambition that
got you Into the Naw

22:17.680 --> 22:19.762
and got you out of the hell
you were raised in,

22:19.810 --> 22:21.983
it's tugging
at you again.

22:22.030 --> 22:24.760
People like you
need to listen to it.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.549
Leaders.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.773
Me

22:28.820 --> 22:30.071
Um... not yet.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.518
You have a group

22:31.560 --> 22:34.028
of the most dangerous,
egotistical men in the world

22:34.090 --> 22:36.558
eating out of the palm
of your hand.

22:36.610 --> 22:38.999
It's because they trust you,
they respect you.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.565
You are a leader.
OCS just puts a stamp

22:42.620 --> 22:45.009
on what everyone else here
already knows.

22:45.050 --> 22:47.223
You get in, you go.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.274
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Tacoma.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.799
I say again,
we are passing Tacoma.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.660
How's that storm?

22:57.330 --> 22:59.798
Shifting the currents
against you.

22:59.850 --> 23:01.158
RHIBs are not gonna be able
to compensate.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.713
What time's that put us
on the platform?

23:02.770 --> 23:05.933
An hour and 20
behind schedule, Bravo 1.

23:05.990 --> 23:07.764
Chasing daylight now.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.765
That sun comes up,
it is game over.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.947
We lose any more time,
your team's in serious danger.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.992
Copy that.

24:24.070 --> 24:26.891
Havoc, this is 1,
we're on target.

24:26.940 --> 24:30.979
Got 30 minutes to sunrise.
Let's move.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.281
2, on you.

24:54.140 --> 24:55.914
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.884
Go for 1, Havoc.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.625
You've got two enemy combatants,

25:02.670 --> 25:04.535
armed, 20 yards east
of your position.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.364
Roger that.

25:06.410 --> 25:08.275
All Bravo
elements hold.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.070
There they are.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.205
MAN:
Down here.

25:22.210 --> 25:24.462
JASON :
Come on, let's go.

25:26.610 --> 25:28.566
Let's go. Let's go.

25:35.570 --> 25:38.357
All Bravo elements,
conﬁnueinﬁL

25:38.400 --> 25:39.958
Checking something

25:40.010 --> 25:41.261
along that
main flow line.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.799
Yeah, my guess, something
that goes "boom."

25:47.190 --> 25:49.101
Dodged that bullet.

25:49.150 --> 25:51.880
Yeah, don't jinx it.
On me.

25:55.550 --> 25:57.415
Last man.

26:19.660 --> 26:21.173
You're up. Do your thing.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.349
You trip one
of them bombs,

26:27.410 --> 26:29.446
it's gonna be Deepwater
Horizon from then on.

26:32.540 --> 26:35.930
What? Do we
have a problem?

26:35.980 --> 26:39.507
They're smart. Bombs aren't
on the same fire line.

26:39.550 --> 26:41.506
I have to defuse them
individually.

26:41.550 --> 26:44.155
Spicoli, how long's
that gonna take?

26:44.210 --> 26:47.771
I got to find them and then
dismantle 'em. 30 minutes.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.459
30 minutes? That puts us
in full daylight.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.988
Havoc, this is 1.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.031
Situation's changed.
We're delayed 30.

26:55.090 --> 26:57.558
We gotta push back
our window of exfil.

26:57.610 --> 27:00.875
I lose ISR in 20 minutes, 1.
We're in the blind after that.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.433
We know.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.650
Bravo 1,

27:03.700 --> 27:05.520
you'll be in sunlight
with no overwatch.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.878
We know.

27:07.930 --> 27:11.229
Bravo 1, be advised,
30 more is all you've got.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.531
Copy that, Havoc.

27:12.580 --> 27:14.366
Trent.
Hey.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.752
Control room,
me and you.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.529
We do not want a gunfight.
We fight with our minds.

27:17.590 --> 27:19.364
Sun's gonna be up when
we come back. You good solo?

27:19.420 --> 27:20.671
Alone's my groove, boss.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.109
Poster boy, hey.
Haul your ass up top.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.594
You got overwatch.
You cover his back. You got it?

27:25.640 --> 27:26.937
Roger that.

27:26.990 --> 27:27.979
Trent, on you.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.568
The drone's got to be
running on empty.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.783
How long till it needs
to head back to the station?

27:44.830 --> 27:47.560
Ten minutes until
we can't see the platform.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.781
We're gonna lose our exfil route
if anybody else shows up.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.263
Yeah, I know.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.928
Bravo 2, you on that?

28:02.980 --> 28:06.234
Bravo 1, platform above you,
you've got a couple of hostiles

28:06.290 --> 28:07.678
pushing around a hostage.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.937
We have a jump?

28:08.990 --> 28:10.469
Negative, Bravo 1,
you start up those stairs,

28:10.510 --> 28:11.727
they're gonna get
the drop on you.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.249
Bravo 2, clear a path for us.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.463
Roger. Getting in position.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.613
CLAY :
Bravo 1, coast is clear.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.585
Hey, where are
the other hostages?

28:47.630 --> 28:50.451
T-Two in the control room.
The others in the break room.

28:50.510 --> 28:51.670
Under the stairs,

28:51.730 --> 28:52.981
stay put. We'll come
back for you.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.725
Bravo 2, this is 1.
What's your view?

28:57.430 --> 28:58.727
All quiet on deck.

29:02.470 --> 29:05.769
CLAY:
EOD, what's your status?

29:05.830 --> 29:08.958
Sun's coming up and I still got
some heaw lifting to do.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.784
All right, well,
stop wasting your time

29:13.830 --> 29:15.354
talking to me, okay?
Come on, let's go.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.742
Trent, with me,
control room.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.756
Sonny, Brock,
break room.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.264
Bravo 3? A little
loud down there.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.617
SONNY :
That wasn't pretty,

30:01.660 --> 30:03.742
but we have
four hostages secure.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.229
So much for the element
of surprise.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.362
Yeah? Well, you ain't
gonna mind this then.

30:10.410 --> 30:11.809
Cover your eyes!

30:13.890 --> 30:15.494
Go, go, go, go!
Up, up!

30:15.550 --> 30:17.154
Up, up! Let's go!
Move!

30:17.200 --> 30:19.509
Look, double-time those hostages
back to the exfil point.

30:19.550 --> 30:20.801
We're gonna turn
into pumpkins soon.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.725
Roger that, boss man.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.635
CLAY :
EOD, this Bravo 2.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.681
Be advised, lost visual on you.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.867
JASON :
EOD?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.218
I'm a little busy at the moment.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.738
We're not ghosts anymore.

30:39.790 --> 30:41.007
No kidding.

30:41.050 --> 30:42.836
They're gonna want
to blow this rig now.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.871
30 seconds,
they won't be able to.

31:05.470 --> 31:06.812
Bingo.

31:06.860 --> 31:09.647
Bravo 1, the platform's secure.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.439
Havoc, this is 1.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.176
Explosives are secured.
Send the boats for exfil.

31:22.220 --> 31:24.780
Copy, Bravo 1. GOPLAT shut down?

31:24.830 --> 31:26.741
It's about to be.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.891
Don't move!

31:48.950 --> 31:50.850
It's okay. We're US. military.
We're gonna get you out of here.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.037
Okay?

31:56.260 --> 31:58.649
Bravo 1, be advised,
we've lost ISR.

31:58.690 --> 32:00.692
We no longer
have eyes on you.

32:00.740 --> 32:02.173
Copy that, Havoc.

32:03.790 --> 32:05.872
Listen, we need
to shut this down.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.080
The whole thing,
the GOPLAT.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.357
Disable the whole thing.
You shut it down?

32:08.400 --> 32:10.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.Shut it down.

32:14.540 --> 32:16.531
That's it. It's done.
Done?

32:16.580 --> 32:17.797
I code locked the panel.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.660
Bravo 3, this is 1.
We're finished up here.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.971
We'll meet you at exfil.

32:21.020 --> 32:22.009
Let's go. Come on, move!

32:22.070 --> 32:23.719
Move!

32:31.950 --> 32:33.156
Got your last one,
boss man.

32:33.210 --> 32:34.723
Bravo 2, how's it looking?

32:34.770 --> 32:38.331
Yeah, no hostiles exited during
the firefight or shutdown.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.119
Looks like we got them all.Havoc?

32:40.170 --> 32:42.161
ERIC: Exfil transport

33:51.240 --> 33:54.289
One of them RPGs is gonna
blow this whole damn thing!

34:20.880 --> 34:23.098
Bravo 4, this is 1.
Platform secured.

34:23.140 --> 34:24.402
Exfil.
We're out of here.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.014
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.
I got a problem up here.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.062
The stairway's cut off.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.453
Yeah, I'm gonna have to meet
you guys down at the bottom.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.934
Come on.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.162
Bravo 2, you good?

35:30.210 --> 35:33.168
Texas judge

35:33.210 --> 35:34.165
Interesting form.

35:45.270 --> 35:48.137
Port side!

35:48.180 --> 35:50.057
We got you! Reach!

35:59.980 --> 36:01.971
Hell of a jump.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.046
Great job of keeping our asses
out of the fire, boss.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.569
Game on for a minute.
Yep.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.349
Yeah, but we handled it,
didn't we?
Mm-hmm.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.356
Same as we always do.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.140
Yeah, it's just been
a while since we

36:36.190 --> 36:39.705
operated with bullets flying,
and without Ray is all.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.236
You got some concerns
there, Sonny?

36:43.280 --> 36:47.717
Well, with pinup girl here
as number two, who wouldn't?

36:47.770 --> 36:51.240
That's right,
pinup girl number two.

36:51.290 --> 36:52.279
I'd follow you anywhere.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.853
And I'm happy we're back.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.368
Right, we're back.We're back.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.594
Watch it.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.514
Hey, swami.

37:06.570 --> 37:08.128
Thanks, man.Yeah.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.260
Well, you know what,
you earned it, Eddie.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.778
You earned it.It was an honor.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.616
Not every day one gets
to roll with the best.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.787
Well, you know, I'm good
with the false modesty,

37:15.840 --> 37:17.614
if that's what I'm
supposed to be doing here.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.001
Not necessary.
Yeah.

37:19.060 --> 37:21.016
I'm just saying
Bravo has a rep.

37:21.060 --> 37:22.539
You all lived up to it.

37:22.580 --> 37:26.619
You know, uh, we're looking
for a new, uh, EOD guy.

37:26.670 --> 37:28.274
Something permanent.
You interested?

37:28.330 --> 37:31.197
That works for me.Does it?

37:31.240 --> 37:34.243
Okay, just one condition,
all right?

37:34.290 --> 37:36.110
As long as you keep,
you know,

37:36.160 --> 37:38.025
freaking Sonny out.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.889
Loud and clear.

37:39.950 --> 37:42.987
All right? Yeah.

37:49.870 --> 37:50.950
Sorry.
Mm...

37:51.000 --> 37:52.342
Didn't mean
to wake you up.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.039
It's just, this is
kind of my bed now, the couch.

37:56.660 --> 37:58.651
Oh...

38:01.320 --> 38:03.311
How'd everything go?Great.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.011
Everyone's safe.
Everyone's good. Good.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.490
How do you feel?

38:10.540 --> 38:12.542
Good, you know?

38:13.980 --> 38:17.245
I'm back in the field.
Exactly where I belong.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.929
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

38:19.990 --> 38:24.461
Chasing a high...
somewhere else in the world.

38:26.390 --> 38:28.199
Mm-hmm.

38:30.390 --> 38:33.951
I-I got to go to bed.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.821
You know, Alana,
I think I found a place.

38:36.870 --> 38:39.691
My own place.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.389
It's close,
so it's not like

38:42.450 --> 38:44.395
I'm not gonna be around
when you need me,

38:44.450 --> 38:46.179
or if you need me
for the kids.

38:46.230 --> 38:48.926
I'm always here
for the kids.You're operating again, so...

38:48.970 --> 38:51.621
it's not like
you're around anyway.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.752
What do you want from me?

38:53.800 --> 38:54.880
Look, I'm...

38:54.940 --> 38:57.363
I'm trying to do
everything here.

38:57.420 --> 39:00.412
What I want...Yeah.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.859
...you can't give.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.458
I'm okay with that now.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.466
Iam.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.462
I guess what I really want...Hmm.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.125
...is for you not to die.

39:14.170 --> 39:18.209
'Cause we have kids

39:18.260 --> 39:20.524
and they love you.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.661
I'm not gonna die.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.922
I don't believe you.
