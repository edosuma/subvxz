WEBVTT

00:32.323 --> 00:34.868
First the stairs have to stop,
then we can go down.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.258
Excuse me.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.178
Giacomo, I'm Amy.

00:54.137 --> 00:54.971
Excuse me.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.390
Careful.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.395
And where's Lino?

01:02.479 --> 01:05.231
Lino's at home, resting.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.357
And how is he?

01:06.441 --> 01:08.401
He's okay.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.447
This is my mother Lynn.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.286
Shall we go?

01:44.729 --> 01:47.273
Filomena, follow me, please.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.696
My darling.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.407
My dear son.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.622
Your father is--

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
I asked my doctor
what could be done for you.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.715
You feel warm. Do you have a fever?

03:35.798 --> 03:37.508
No, Mama, I'm fine.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.471
Lie down.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.722
I'm fine.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.767
Lie down, my son. Slowly, slowly. My son…

04:12.293 --> 04:14.545
I'll take care of you now.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.599
Is there flour? Do you have flour?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.184
Uh, yes.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.729
One second. It's here.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.355
And the pots?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.275
Take this to Lino.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.112
No, he can't eat that. No.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.197
What do you mean?

06:05.198 --> 06:11.120
His surgery is tomorrow.
He needs simple foods.

06:11.662 --> 06:16.000
Since the chemo,
everything tastes like metal to him.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.503
Then what will he eat for dinner?

06:21.464 --> 06:24.008
He'll eat this

06:24.967 --> 06:26.469
and this.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.932
That's not dinner.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.433
I know, but…

06:33.059 --> 06:35.561
Look what she's feeding him.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.524
I'm following
the doctor's instructions. Please.

06:41.984 --> 06:42.819
Look.

06:44.070 --> 06:49.367
The surgery is tomorrow.
Then he stays in hospital for two days.

06:49.450 --> 06:53.913
Then we wait till the day after Christmas,
which is when we go back to the doctor,

06:53.996 --> 06:56.582
to see how Lino is doing.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.585
The day after Christmas is a good day.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.920
That's a blessed day.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.850
It took me hours to fix that garden,
and I'm still not done.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.895
It's a good thing
Lino doesn't farm anymore

07:17.979 --> 07:19.230
because it's not for him.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.776
The plants are all positioned wrong.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.029
And a pot for an olive tree?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.114
America.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.995
Is there no cheese?
Don't they use it here?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.373
Excuse me.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.418
Aren't you going to say hello to him?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.508
Wait, why not?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.677
I don't understand at all.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.597
Why did you make
such a long trip and then not--

07:52.680 --> 07:54.432
Hold on.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.604
You don't have to worry.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.649
I know why I'm here.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.785
Is there nothing to wipe my mouth?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.590
Did they take him to the operating room?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.175
Soon. Yes.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.719
How long will it take?

12:09.061 --> 12:12.106
-What did you say to her?
-That it will be four hours.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.275
-Weren't you listening?
-Mind your business.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.056
I'd like you to meet my sister Zora.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.976
-Uh, this is my father, Hershel.
-Who is she?

12:49.059 --> 12:51.228
I'm Amy's stepmother.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.815
Ah, you speak Italian?
Have you been to Italy?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.443
She's learning.
She doesn't speak much Italian.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.497
It's over. The tumor, it's gone.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.846
My darling.
You're a strong man, blessed by the Lord.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.139
Hello, Mama.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.930
You couldn't have brought me
a cup of coffee?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.352
My son wants coffee?

18:26.021 --> 18:27.064
I got it.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.546
It's for my son.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.674
When he was little,

19:36.800 --> 19:38.260
he might've been ten years old,

19:38.343 --> 19:41.138
he took the car out, and he crashed.

19:41.221 --> 19:45.934
It hit a wall. He was
with my brother, his uncle, the idiot.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.769
He went to the hospital.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.148
With a broken leg.
And this is what I said to him,

19:52.024 --> 19:53.734
"Because of this stunt…

19:58.947 --> 20:00.657
we can't get a color TV now."

20:02.701 --> 20:03.744
I said that.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.669
I couldn't tell him I was scared to death.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.129
Because

20:16.006 --> 20:17.424
it's awful for a father…

20:19.676 --> 20:21.386
to see his son in a hospital.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.178
How are you feeling?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.599
So-so. Papa, what are you doing?
You cut the roses?

21:49.683 --> 21:54.354
Didn't I teach you? You have to cut
the roses in the winter, when it's cold,

21:54.438 --> 21:57.107
otherwise then they don't bloom.
Don't you remember?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.867
Mama, what did you do?

22:10.746 --> 22:11.705
Let's get inside.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.501
Are you thirsty?

22:17.711 --> 22:19.129
I'll get you some water.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.927
Filomena, can you
help me get him into bed?

22:26.011 --> 22:27.262
Into bed?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.930
The sheets are still wet.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.767
But we have a dryer.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.644
It would save time.
Then he could rest properly.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.357
But do you see?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.777
It's the first time they've
watched television together in so long.

22:44.571 --> 22:48.700
You're going to make us all deaf.
Turn down the television.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.911
I can't understand what they're saying.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.455
Papa, making it louder won't change that.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.167
I looked for Italian channels,
but you don't have any.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.836
What am I supposed to do, turn off the TV?

23:06.301 --> 23:08.261
Tell them the food is almost ready.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.557
No, he can't eat eggplant.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.936
How come he can't eat it?
He can't just have a banana.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.854
He'll get sick if he eats that.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.234
He's already sick.
At least he should eat well.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.280
And I brought everything
to make the cuccidati.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.907
Those Christmas cookies?

23:30.409 --> 23:35.163
No, he can't eat that.
That's too much sugar.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.855
Why aren't you eating?

24:01.857 --> 24:02.774
I am eating.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.861
You're picking at it.

24:08.363 --> 24:12.325
If you don't eat it, you'll scare
your mother. Worry her even more.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.414
What, you don't like
the food of your home anymore?

24:43.231 --> 24:44.399
You're a traitor.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.264
He's trying to cheat me.
He knows I'm Sicilian.

25:57.347 --> 26:01.685
-How would he know that?
-You don't know Northern Italians.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.020
-You speak Italian?
-This is my father-in-law.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.235
Are you eating all the bread?

26:10.318 --> 26:12.529
If I don't try it,
how do I know if it's good?

26:12.612 --> 26:16.992
And I tell you what, see this?
You can throw it away, understand?

26:17.075 --> 26:20.787
Yes, because it's fermented dough.
It's called sourdough.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.088
Now take me to a real bakery.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.090
Not one like this, in this city.

26:32.173 --> 26:35.385
It sells everything--
bread, fish, medicine.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.263
What, is he the butcher too?
Does he sell meat?

26:38.346 --> 26:42.434
This place makes no sense!
I've had enough.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.870
You shouldn't touch it.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.601
Wait, take this to Filomena.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.395
Let me look at the wires.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.396
Come on.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.150
No, Papa, please, let them do it.

27:32.233 --> 27:35.195
-Your Uncle Franco taught me
some things, quiet.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.112
-Papa--

27:49.125 --> 27:52.295
I told you I knew what to do.

28:08.770 --> 28:12.232
The food's ready. Let's eat!

28:12.315 --> 28:13.149
Let's sit down.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.162
Where is your father from?

28:26.246 --> 28:28.665
Aliminusa, near Cerda.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.208
You know it?

28:30.291 --> 28:33.795
-Yes, I know it well.
-Yes.

28:33.878 --> 28:36.506
And has your father visited? In America?

28:36.589 --> 28:39.175
Yes, yes, when my son was born.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.429
-Ah! You have a little boy?
-Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.514
-He has a boy.
-Yes.

28:44.597 --> 28:50.395
Your mother and father must
be so happy to have a grandson.

34:58.221 --> 35:01.682
The cancer is gone.
The surgery couldn't have gone better.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.143
-Good.
-Thank you, God.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.286
What's he saying?

35:22.370 --> 35:24.122
I'm trying to understand.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.591
Why is your wife crying?

35:37.718 --> 35:41.472
The cancer I have is like a weed, Papa.
Even if you pull it, it still comes back.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.534
What did the doctor say?

36:01.617 --> 36:03.953
He's explaining
how he can make Lino better.

36:04.537 --> 36:09.542
-I thought he was better.
-Listen to the doctor.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.489
Placebo. What does that mean?

36:46.704 --> 36:49.582
Lino, answer me. What is a placebo?

36:51.792 --> 36:53.252
It's a sugar pill, Papa.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.796
A sugar pill?

36:55.880 --> 37:00.218
The doctor is going
to give my sick son a sugar pill?

37:01.928 --> 37:03.346
Where did he study?

37:03.429 --> 37:06.140
It's a new thing
they're experimenting with now.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.018
They're experimenting on you?

37:18.361 --> 37:22.114
Why can't he give you
the real medicine if they have it and--

37:24.659 --> 37:26.369
Can you step outside with me?

37:28.037 --> 37:28.871
Now.

37:42.843 --> 37:46.514
Lino has to make
the hardest decision of his life.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.475
And it's his decision.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.769
His, understand?

37:51.852 --> 37:55.439
His doctor is one
of the best in the world,

37:55.523 --> 37:58.067
and he's giving him the chance to live.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.820
Please, leave him alone.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.155
But what is this experimental medicine?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.615
It's not medicine.

38:04.699 --> 38:09.453
Now isn't the time to discuss the history
of Western medicine. Understand?

38:10.079 --> 38:14.083
You must trust your son,
because it's his life.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.794
Listen to me carefully.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.342
I'm always on his side. In everything.

38:24.176 --> 38:27.805
And if you can't respect
your son's choices,

38:27.888 --> 38:30.808
you can fly back to Sicily today.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.613
My father said Lino is not alone.

40:53.492 --> 40:56.829
I didn't know there was so much love here.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.831
For my son.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.819
Tell them congratulations from me.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.030
A wedding is always very important.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.962
You have no dignity.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.785
You should be ashamed.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.704
You celebrate a wedding
of someone you don't know,

42:21.705 --> 42:24.875
and you know it hurts my mother.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.252
The real shame is you.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.880
You're the real shame.

42:30.464 --> 42:32.049
A son that left everything behind.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.301
His home, his family,

42:34.385 --> 42:35.219
his land.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.304
Like it was nothing.

42:37.388 --> 42:41.350
I want to follow my own dreams.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.435
And left me alone.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.772
Alone!

42:47.398 --> 42:49.024
You could've hired someone.

42:49.608 --> 42:52.194
I didn't want just anyone!

42:59.326 --> 43:00.703
I wanted you.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.622
You.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.126
You didn't want me.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.796
You wanted another you.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.591
What's wrong with that?
What did I do wrong?

43:14.842 --> 43:16.677
What did I do to make you leave?

43:18.262 --> 43:19.346
Tell me.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.514
Look, Papa.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.059
I left

43:24.977 --> 43:26.478
to build a life of my own.

43:27.062 --> 43:28.272
I don't understand you.

43:30.024 --> 43:30.858
I know.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.324
But can you accept me?

43:42.453 --> 43:44.038
Look, Papa, the weeds…

43:44.872 --> 43:47.124
my disease can come back at any time.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.755
The truth is I'm tired.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.509
I'm tired, Papa.

43:59.845 --> 44:02.222
I can't fight this disease and you.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.478
So now you have to choose.

44:09.271 --> 44:11.690
Are we two angry men?

44:14.818 --> 44:16.570
Or father and son?

44:31.585 --> 44:34.505
Mama, it only keeps for so long.

44:34.588 --> 44:37.091
You're saying you won't eat it all?

44:37.174 --> 44:39.259
I'll eat it all
before you get back to Sicily.

44:40.969 --> 44:43.472
I put sugar in. Just how you like it.

44:53.065 --> 44:53.941
Go to him.

45:01.490 --> 45:05.202
Don't work yourself too hard.

45:05.786 --> 45:09.039
No such thing. Come here.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.333
Come here. I want to show you

45:11.959 --> 45:14.336
the right way to plant things, okay?

45:14.420 --> 45:17.881
If you don't, the herbs won't taste right.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.426
And taste matters to a chef.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.428
It's all that matters, Papa.

45:23.345 --> 45:24.179
Look,

45:25.305 --> 45:28.934
if you really want
to become a cook here in America,

45:30.060 --> 45:31.228
I'm happy.

45:48.704 --> 45:49.872
Are you still hurting?

45:49.955 --> 45:51.457
Not so much anymore.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.420
I'm fine, Papa. It's nothing.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.841
Well, you know what is hurting?

46:00.924 --> 46:02.176
Do you know?

46:02.259 --> 46:03.343
This tree here.

46:03.927 --> 46:07.347
This olive tree here.
Because it's in this pot.

46:07.431 --> 46:11.810
I did what I could,
but it will never bear fruit. Trust me.

46:16.190 --> 46:21.153
Don't let anyone touch this garden,
because I've worked a lot.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.614
You mean what's left of my rose bushes?

46:24.323 --> 46:27.701
You'll see. In spring, you'll see.

46:35.459 --> 46:36.835
She's like your mother.

46:40.547 --> 46:41.381
Bye, Papa.

47:13.789 --> 47:14.873
My son.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.421
You made a miracle.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.385
Of course, now,

47:26.468 --> 47:28.470
a real miracle would be a baby.

47:29.471 --> 47:33.475
Because a baby
would give him more strength, more life.
