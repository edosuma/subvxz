00:20.834 --> 00:23.894
<i>The war to end all wars</i>
<i>did not end soon enough.</i>

00:23.970 --> 00:27.906
<i>So, Heartland, U.S.A.</i>
<i>sent the allies...</i>

00:27.974 --> 00:30.340
<i>its most effective secret weapon.</i>

00:37.818 --> 00:40.719
<i>Sergeant Pepper...</i>

00:40.787 --> 00:43.278
<i>and his Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

01:23.663 --> 01:27.292
<i>For music above and beyond</i>
<i>the call of duty...</i>

01:27.367 --> 01:31.064
<i>Sergeant Pepper was awarded</i>
<i>the coveted Golden Eagle.</i>

01:42.082 --> 01:45.051
<i>Heartland was proud</i>
<i>of its famous sergeant.</i>

01:45.118 --> 01:47.848
<i>But more than that, they delighted</i>
<i>in knowing that he remained...</i>

01:47.921 --> 01:50.583
<i>a good, simple, small-town boy.</i>

01:57.831 --> 02:00.857
<i>Every time Sergeant Pepper played,</i>
<i>the world danced.</i>

02:03.570 --> 02:06.038
<i>They danced through</i>
<i>the Roaring Twenties,</i>

02:13.847 --> 02:15.838
<i>the Depression,</i>

02:30.697 --> 02:32.688
<i>economic recovery...</i>

02:57.190 --> 02:59.954
<i>and yet... another great war.</i>

03:16.877 --> 03:21.371
<i>And for some 50-odd years,</i>
<i>Heartland's feet tapped to the beat...</i>

03:21.448 --> 03:24.576
<i>of Sergeant Pepper's magical music.</i>

03:27.888 --> 03:30.721
How do you honor someone
who had done so much...

03:30.790 --> 03:34.089
to make so many people so happy?

03:34.160 --> 03:37.789
Heartland decided to erect
a Sergeant Pepper weather vane...

03:37.864 --> 03:40.094
on top of our city hall.

03:40.166 --> 03:43.158
It would always point
the way to happiness.

03:43.236 --> 03:46.069
And as mayor,
I presided over the ceremony.

03:48.108 --> 03:52.568
At the end, Sergeant Pepper assured us
that he would play us one more tune.

04:32.986 --> 04:34.977
Oh, well.

04:36.156 --> 04:39.648
August 10, 1958.

04:41.061 --> 04:44.053
A day none of us
will ever forget.

04:44.130 --> 04:48.191
To the town of Heartland,
he left his musical instruments.

04:48.268 --> 04:53.501
These instruments have the power
to make dreams come true.

04:53.573 --> 04:56.633
And as long as they remained
in Heartland's care,

04:56.710 --> 05:00.202
humanity would live
happily forever after.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.374
Sergeant Pepper left
his wholesome grandson, Billy Shears,

05:03.450 --> 05:05.384
<i>his cherished Golden Eagle.</i>

05:05.452 --> 05:09.980
<i>This made Billy's stepbrother, the greedy</i>
<i>Dougie Shears, veryjealous indeed.</i>

05:10.056 --> 05:15.585
<i>Sergeant Pepper then asked Billy</i>
<i>to form a new Sergeant Pepper's</i>
<i>Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

05:15.662 --> 05:18.495
This band would feature
Billy's three best friends.

05:18.565 --> 05:21.466
<i>Mark, Dave and Bob Henderson.</i>

05:21.534 --> 05:25.903
We wondered if there would ever be a new
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

05:27.574 --> 05:30.600
And we wondered what
the new band would sound like.

05:32.312 --> 05:34.837
<i>Dougie appointed himself</i>
<i>their business manager...</i>

05:34.914 --> 05:36.905
<i>and introduced the band</i>
<i>in his own unique way.</i>

05:46.660 --> 05:49.060
It was 20 years ago today

05:49.129 --> 05:51.654
Sergeant Pepper
taught the band to play

05:51.731 --> 05:54.165
They've been going
in and out of style

05:54.234 --> 05:56.964
But they're guaranteed
to raise a smile

05:57.037 --> 05:59.528
So may I introduce to you

05:59.606 --> 06:02.040
The act you've known
for all these years

06:02.108 --> 06:06.545
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

06:19.659 --> 06:24.824
We're Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

06:24.898 --> 06:28.698
We hope you will enjoy the show

06:30.070 --> 06:34.871
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

06:34.941 --> 06:38.433
Sit back and let the evening go

06:40.246 --> 06:42.441
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely

06:42.515 --> 06:45.075
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely

06:45.151 --> 06:50.111
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band

06:50.190 --> 06:55.059
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill

06:55.128 --> 07:00.065
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us

07:00.133 --> 07:02.533
We'd love to take you home

07:02.602 --> 07:05.093
I don't really want to
stop the show

07:05.171 --> 07:07.731
But I thought you
might like to know

07:07.807 --> 07:10.207
That the singer's gonna
sing a song

07:10.276 --> 07:12.870
And he wants you all
to sing along

07:12.946 --> 07:15.414
So let me introduce to you

07:15.482 --> 07:17.643
The one and only Billy Shears

07:17.717 --> 07:22.381
<i>Sergeant Pepper's</i>
<i>Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>

07:30.997 --> 07:35.297
<i>Billy</i>

07:35.368 --> 07:37.598
<i>Shears</i>

07:39.739 --> 07:43.505
What would you think
if I sang out of tune

07:43.576 --> 07:46.704
Would you stand up
and walk out on me

07:48.681 --> 07:52.481
Lend me your ears
and I'll sing you a song

07:52.552 --> 07:55.544
And I'll try not to
sing out of key

07:57.090 --> 08:00.582
<i>I get by with a little help</i>
<i>from my friends</i>

08:00.660 --> 08:04.357
Mmm, I get high with a little help
from my friends

08:04.430 --> 08:09.163
Yeah, gonna try with a little help
from my friends

08:15.375 --> 08:18.742
<i>What do I do</i>
<i>when my love is away</i>

08:18.812 --> 08:22.646
Does it worry you to be alone

08:24.050 --> 08:27.747
How do I feel
by the end of the day

08:27.821 --> 08:30.813
Are you sad because
you're on your own

08:30.890 --> 08:35.418
No, I get by with a little help
from my friends

08:35.495 --> 08:40.261
Yeah, I get high with a little help
from my friends

08:40.332 --> 08:45.066
<i>Gonna try with a little help</i>
<i>from my friends</i>

08:45.138 --> 08:49.165
Do you need anybody

08:50.410 --> 08:53.402
I need somebody to love

08:53.479 --> 08:58.917
<i>Could it be anybody</i>

08:58.985 --> 09:02.944
<i>I just want somebody to love</i>

09:03.022 --> 09:07.459
Would you believe
in a love at first sight

09:07.527 --> 09:11.361
Yes, I'm certain that
it happens all the time

09:12.765 --> 09:16.098
<i>What do you see</i>
<i>when you turn out the light</i>

09:16.169 --> 09:20.071
I can't tell you
but I know it's mine

09:20.139 --> 09:23.939
<i>Oh, I get by with a little help</i>
<i>from my friends</i>

09:24.010 --> 09:28.538
Yeah, I get high with a little help
from my friends

09:28.615 --> 09:33.985
Oooh, I'm gonna try with
a little help from my friends

09:34.053 --> 09:37.045
I get high with a little help
from my friends

09:37.123 --> 09:43.062
With a little help
from my friends

09:48.735 --> 09:52.398
<i>Heartland loved the boys,</i>
<i>and the boys loved music.</i>

09:52.472 --> 09:54.599
<i>Billy and Strawberry loved each other.</i>

09:54.674 --> 09:57.302
<i>And Dougie loved making money.</i>

09:57.377 --> 10:00.471
<i>But on that memorable day</i>
<i>a telegram arrived...</i>

10:00.546 --> 10:02.673
<i>that was destined</i>
<i>to change their lives.</i>

10:06.753 --> 10:10.086
<i>It came from B.D. Hoffler,</i>
<i>the president of Big Deal Records,</i>

10:10.156 --> 10:12.420
<i>the world's largest,</i>
<i>most successful record company.</i>

10:13.526 --> 10:15.824
<i>''We hear your music is great. Stop.</i>

10:15.895 --> 10:20.195
<i>''We need a tape of your songs,</i>
<i>and we need it now. Stop.</i>

10:20.266 --> 10:24.635
<i>''If we like your music, we'll make you</i>
<i>superstars and the money will never stop.</i>
<i>Stop.</i>

10:24.704 --> 10:27.002
<i>Signed, B.D. Hoffler, Hollywood. ''</i>

10:27.073 --> 10:29.633
<i>A long, long way from Heartland.</i>

10:34.981 --> 10:38.109
<i>How about that?</i>
<i>Superstars from Heartland.</i>

10:38.184 --> 10:40.311
<i>Who could be more deserving?</i>

10:40.386 --> 10:43.378
<i>Wouldn't Sergeant Pepper be proud?</i>

10:43.456 --> 10:45.754
<i>Just think. Superstars.</i>

10:45.825 --> 10:48.293
<i>Who could be more deserving?</i>

10:48.361 --> 10:50.295
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:51.931 --> 10:55.799
I'm fixing a hole
where the rain gets in

10:55.868 --> 10:58.735
And stops my mind
from wandering

10:58.805 --> 11:02.866
<i>Where it will go</i>

11:07.880 --> 11:12.340
I'm filling the cracks
that ran through the door

11:12.418 --> 11:15.876
That kept my mind
from wandering

11:15.955 --> 11:19.254
Where it will go

11:23.930 --> 11:28.333
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong I'm right

11:28.401 --> 11:33.100
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong

11:33.172 --> 11:36.903
See the people standing there
who disagree and never win

11:36.976 --> 11:40.969
And wonder why
they don't get in my door

11:41.047 --> 11:45.006
I'm painting my room
in a colorful way

11:45.084 --> 11:48.611
And when my mind
is wandering

11:48.688 --> 11:51.782
There I will go

11:53.393 --> 11:57.056
<i>La, la, la, la, la</i>

11:57.130 --> 12:01.328
I'm fixing a hole
where the rain gets in

12:01.401 --> 12:05.235
And stops my mind
from wandering

12:05.304 --> 12:07.238
-  Where
-  Where

12:07.306 --> 12:09.274
-  It
-  It

12:09.342 --> 12:11.310
-  Will
-  Will

12:11.377 --> 12:13.311
-  Go
-  Go

12:13.379 --> 12:15.506
Oh, one and a two

12:15.581 --> 12:19.517
One, two, three
Da-da, bah, bah

12:19.585 --> 12:21.610
Bah, bah, bah, bah

12:21.687 --> 12:25.953
Bah, bah bah, bah, bah-bah

12:26.025 --> 12:29.426
Dee-dee, dee-doo, dee-doo
dee-diddledy diddledy diddledy

12:29.495 --> 12:31.554
And one

12:31.631 --> 12:33.895
Two

12:34.534 --> 12:35.899
<i>One, two</i>

12:35.968 --> 12:38.334
One, two, three, four

12:42.508 --> 12:46.000
It's getting better
all the time

12:46.079 --> 12:49.981
-  Used to get mad at my school
-  But I can't complain

12:50.049 --> 12:53.576
The teachers that taught me
weren't cool
<i>No, I can't complain</i>

12:53.653 --> 12:56.247
<i>You're holding me down</i>

13:07.567 --> 13:11.003
<i>It's getting better</i>
<i>all the time</i>

13:11.070 --> 13:14.767
<i>- I used to get mad at my school</i>
<i>- But I can't complain</i>

13:14.841 --> 13:17.776
<i>The teachers that taught me</i>
<i>weren't cool</i>

13:17.844 --> 13:20.938
<i>No, I can't complain</i>
<i>You're holding me down</i>

13:21.013 --> 13:23.174
<i>You're turning me round</i>
<i>Ahhh</i>

13:23.249 --> 13:26.343
<i>Filling me up</i>
<i>with your rules</i>

13:26.419 --> 13:30.185
<i>I got to admit it's getting better</i>

13:30.256 --> 13:33.657
<i>Better</i>
<i>A little better all the time</i>

13:33.726 --> 13:38.129
<i>Can't get no worse</i>
<i>I have to admit</i>
<i>it's getting better</i>

13:38.197 --> 13:40.188
Better
It's getting better

13:40.266 --> 13:43.064
<i>Since you've been mine</i>

13:47.073 --> 13:49.701
Me used to be
angry young man

13:49.775 --> 13:53.711
<i>Me hiding me head</i>
<i>in the sand</i>

13:55.615 --> 13:58.482
Keep your mind on business.

14:01.854 --> 14:06.188
- Take over Heartland.
<i>- I've got to admit it's getting better</i>

14:06.259 --> 14:09.422
<i>- Better</i>
<i>- A little better all the time</i>

14:09.495 --> 14:12.259
<i>It can't get no worse</i>
<i>I have to admit</i>

14:12.331 --> 14:14.322
<i>It's getting better</i>
Why?

14:19.005 --> 14:20.996
We hate love.

14:21.073 --> 14:24.668
We hate joy.
We love money.

14:24.744 --> 14:27.474
Money. Money.

14:27.547 --> 14:29.742
Money. Money.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.811
It's getting better
all the time

14:34.887 --> 14:39.085
Better, better, better

14:42.995 --> 14:45.623
<i>I used to be cruel</i>
<i>to my woman</i>

14:45.698 --> 14:48.326
<i>I beat her</i>
<i>and kept her apart</i>

14:48.401 --> 14:50.801
<i>From the things</i>
<i>that she loved</i>

14:53.172 --> 14:56.471
<i>Man, I was mean</i>
<i>but I'm changing my scene</i>

14:56.542 --> 14:59.943
<i>And I'm doing</i>
<i>the best that I can</i>

15:00.012 --> 15:03.948
<i>Oooh-ooh</i>
<i>I admit it's getting better</i>

15:04.016 --> 15:07.144
<i>Better</i>
<i>A little better all the time</i>

15:07.220 --> 15:11.884
<i>It can't get no worse</i>
<i>Yes, I admit</i>
<i>it's getting better</i>

15:11.958 --> 15:14.222
<i>Better</i>
<i>It's getting better</i>

15:14.293 --> 15:16.853
<i>Since you've been mine</i>

15:16.929 --> 15:20.888
<i>Getting so much better</i>
<i>all the time</i>

15:20.967 --> 15:24.596
<i>It's getting better all the time</i>

15:24.670 --> 15:28.800
<i>Better, better, better</i>

15:28.874 --> 15:33.470
<i>Getting so much better</i>

15:48.327 --> 15:51.296
<i>Big Deal lost no time in responding.</i>

15:51.364 --> 15:54.299
<i>The telegram read,</i>
<i>''B.D. loves your music.</i>

15:54.367 --> 15:57.734
<i>B.D. loves you. Expect you</i>
<i>in Hollywood tomorrow. Signed, B.D. ''</i>

16:01.607 --> 16:03.632
<i>Everybody was happy.</i>

16:03.709 --> 16:06.371
<i>But Strawberry realized that</i>
<i>she and Billy would be separated...</i>

16:06.445 --> 16:09.710
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in their young lives.</i>

16:09.782 --> 16:12.410
<i>There was barely time</i>
<i>for tender farewells.</i>

16:58.731 --> 17:00.824
Here comes the sun

17:02.535 --> 17:06.368
Here comes the sun and I say

17:06.439 --> 17:08.771
It's all right

17:12.377 --> 17:14.311
Little darlin'

17:14.380 --> 17:18.248
It's been a long
cold, lonely winter

17:20.252 --> 17:22.185
Little darlin'

17:22.253 --> 17:26.623
It feels like years
since it's been here

17:28.027 --> 17:30.996
Here comes the sun

17:32.098 --> 17:35.625
Here comes the sun and I say

17:35.701 --> 17:37.635
It's all right

17:45.611 --> 17:47.738
Little darlin'

17:47.813 --> 17:53.581
The smiles returning
to their faces

17:53.652 --> 17:55.586
Little darlin'

17:55.654 --> 18:01.286
It feels like years
since it's been here

18:01.360 --> 18:03.555
<i>Well, here comes the sun</i>

18:05.598 --> 18:09.466
<i>Here comes the sun and I say</i>

18:09.535 --> 18:11.799
<i>It's all right</i>

18:18.544 --> 18:22.480
Sun, sun, sun
Here it comes

18:24.917 --> 18:28.751
Sun, sun, sun
Here it comes

18:30.756 --> 18:34.590
Sun, sun, sun
Here it comes

18:43.903 --> 18:45.996
<i>Little darlin'</i>

18:46.071 --> 18:50.440
<i>I feel that ice is</i>
<i>slowly melting</i>

18:51.944 --> 18:53.878
<i>Little darlin'</i>

18:53.946 --> 18:58.212
<i>It seems like years</i>
<i>since it's been here</i>

19:00.085 --> 19:02.144
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

19:03.756 --> 19:07.556
<i>Here comes the sun and I say</i>

19:07.626 --> 19:09.560
It's all right

19:12.865 --> 19:15.333
Oh, it's all right

19:34.053 --> 19:36.180
<i>It's all right</i>

19:39.825 --> 19:42.555
<i>Oh, it's all right</i>

19:45.598 --> 19:48.328
<i>Oh, it's all right</i>

20:59.204 --> 21:01.229
I want you

21:02.641 --> 21:05.576
<i>I want you so badly</i>

21:06.645 --> 21:08.875
I want you

He's a real nowhere man

Sitting in his nowhere land

33:09.567 --> 33:15.369
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody

33:18.343 --> 33:22.507
Doesn't have a point of view

33:22.580 --> 33:26.983
Knows not where he's going to

33:27.052 --> 33:31.682
Isn't he a bit like you and me

33:34.526 --> 33:38.929
Nowhere man, please listen

33:38.997 --> 33:43.400
You don't know

33:43.468 --> 33:45.902
Nowhere man

33:45.970 --> 33:50.236
The world is
at your command

33:52.544 --> 33:56.674
He's a real nowhere man

34:18.002 --> 34:23.496

34:33.717 --> 34:36.414
Well, you should see
Polythene Pam

34:36.487 --> 34:39.047
She's so good-looking
but she looks like a man

34:39.123 --> 34:41.752
You should see her in drag
dressed in a polythene bag

34:41.826 --> 34:44.556
Yeah, you should see
Polythene Pam

34:44.629 --> 34:46.893
Yeah, yeah, yeah

34:52.437 --> 34:54.563
Get a dose of her
in jackboots and kilt

34:54.639 --> 34:56.937
She's killer-diller when
she's dressed to the hilt

34:57.007 --> 35:00.102
She's the kind of a girl that
makes the <i>News of the World</i>

35:00.178 --> 35:03.113
<i>Yeah,you could say</i>
<i>she was attractively built</i>

35:03.181 --> 35:06.014
<i>Yeah,yeah,yeah</i>

35:14.659 --> 35:17.787
She came in through
the bathroom window

35:20.231 --> 35:24.099
Protected by a silver spoon

35:25.703 --> 35:29.730
But now she sucks her thumb
and wonders

35:29.808 --> 35:33.403
By the banks
of her own lagoon

35:33.478 --> 35:36.811
Didn't anybody tell her

Tuesday's on the phone to me

35:53.364 --> 35:56.765
She said she'd
always been a dancer

35:59.204 --> 36:02.071
She worked at 15 clubs a day

36:04.576 --> 36:08.672
And though she thought
I knew the answer

36:08.746 --> 36:11.874
Well, I knew
but I could not say

36:11.950 --> 36:15.818
<i>And so I quit</i>
<i>the police department</i>

36:17.922 --> 36:20.447
And got myself a steady job

36:23.361 --> 36:25.852
And though she tried her best
to help me

36:27.232 --> 36:30.668
She could steal
but she could not rob

36:30.735 --> 36:34.171
Didn't anybody tell her

36:36.441 --> 36:39.569
Didn't anybody see

Sleeps in a hole in the road

Saving up to buy up some clothes

Keeps a 10-bob note up his nose

Steal the instruments.

41:08.613 --> 41:12.515
Bring the saxophone to me. F.V.B.

Wednesday morning at 5:00

43:36.294 --> 43:39.491
As the day begins

43:42.667 --> 43:46.728
Silently closing
her bedroom door

43:48.139 --> 43:53.099
Leaving the note that
she hoped would say more

43:53.177 --> 43:57.614

to the kitchen

Clutching her handkerchief

Quietly turning

<i>Picks up the letter</i>

<i>Standing alone</i>

<i>and cries to her husband</i>

45:08.919 --> 45:12.787

46:13.984 --> 46:16.384
Wake up. Wake up.

46:19.390 --> 46:23.986
Look. Strawberry is leaving.

47:28.058 --> 47:33.860
Picture yourself

48:32.356 --> 48:35.325
Ahhh

48:35.392 --> 48:40.921
Follow her down
to a bridge by a fountain

48:40.998 --> 48:43.831
Where rocking horse people

48:43.901 --> 48:48.565
Eat marshmallow pies

48:48.639 --> 48:53.303
<i>Everyone smiles as</i>
<i>you drift past the flowers</i>

48:53.377 --> 48:58.679

Newspaper taxis
appear on the shore

49:40.624 --> 49:46.085
Picture yourself
on a train in a station

49:46.163 --> 49:48.631
With plasticine porters

49:48.699 --> 49:52.999
With looking glass ties

49:53.070 --> 49:58.770
Suddenly someone is
there at the turnstile

49:58.842 --> 50:03.142
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

50:07.084 --> 50:10.485
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds

50:10.554 --> 50:12.488
Talkin' about Lucy

50:12.556 --> 50:16.424

<i>You didn't need me anymore</i>

52:22.753 --> 52:24.687
<i>Well,you know</i>

52:24.755 --> 52:30.193
<i>I nearly broke down and cried</i>

Oh, darling

53:55.145 --> 53:57.875
Please believe me

54:08.625 --> 54:13.619
Well, while Mustard roamed through
the building looking for Strawberry,

54:13.697 --> 54:17.531
she and her Heartland friends
dashed to the van and captured it.

54:17.601 --> 54:20.536
<i>Now, the question is</i>
<i>could the boys discover...</i>

54:20.604 --> 54:24.335
<i>how to use this computerized</i>
<i>link to F. V.B....</i>

54:24.408 --> 54:26.399
<i>to help recover</i>
<i>the lost instruments.</i>

54:47.764 --> 54:52.201
Turn on the big screen.

55:02.646 --> 55:06.673
Take the cornet to Dr. Maxwell.

55:13.824 --> 55:18.887
<i>Dr. Maxwell, a small-time</i>
<i>quack who became a big-time specialist...</i>

55:18.962 --> 55:22.261
<i>turning ugly, old corrupt people</i>
<i>into handsome,young corrupt people.</i>

55:32.275 --> 55:35.540
Joan was quizzical
Studied pataphysical

55:35.612 --> 55:38.979
Science in the home

55:39.049 --> 55:42.416
Late nights all alone
with a test tube

55:42.486 --> 55:45.785
Oh, oh, oh, oh

55:45.856 --> 55:48.620
Maxwell Edison
majoring in medicine

55:48.692 --> 55:52.560
Calls her on the phone

55:52.629 --> 55:55.655
Can I take you
out to the pictures

55:55.732 --> 55:59.224
Jo-o-o-oan

55:59.302 --> 56:02.533
But as she's
getting ready to go

56:02.606 --> 56:06.064
A knock comes on the door

56:06.143 --> 56:08.873
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

56:08.945 --> 56:12.813
Came down upon her head

56:12.883 --> 56:15.784
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

56:15.852 --> 56:18.650
Made sure that she was dead

56:26.196 --> 56:30.257
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again

56:30.333 --> 56:32.995
Teacher gets annoyed

56:33.070 --> 56:39.703
Wishing to avoid
an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene

56:39.776 --> 56:43.177
She tells Max to stay
when the class has gone away

56:43.246 --> 56:46.511
So he waits behind

56:46.583 --> 56:53.147
Writing 50 times
I must not be so-o-o-o

56:53.223 --> 56:56.556
But when she turns
her back on the boy

56:56.626 --> 56:59.925
He creeps up from behind

56:59.996 --> 57:02.897
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

57:02.966 --> 57:06.060
Came down upon her head

57:06.136 --> 57:09.503
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

57:09.573 --> 57:12.269
Made sure she was dead

57:12.342 --> 57:15.800
Ho, ho, ohh

57:40.170 --> 57:43.469
<i>P.C. 31 said</i>
<i>we caught a dirty one</i>

57:43.540 --> 57:46.270
<i>Maxwell stands alone</i>

57:46.343 --> 57:50.143
Painting testimonial pictures

57:50.213 --> 57:53.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh

57:53.650 --> 57:56.881
Rose and Valerie
screaming from the gallery

57:56.953 --> 58:00.184
Say he must go free

58:00.257 --> 58:02.487
The judge does not agree

58:02.559 --> 58:06.928
And he tells them so
Oh, oh, oh

58:06.997 --> 58:10.364
But as the words
are leaving his lips

58:10.433 --> 58:13.800
A noise comes from behind

58:13.870 --> 58:16.737
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

58:16.807 --> 58:20.504
Came down upon his head

58:20.577 --> 58:23.375
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

58:23.446 --> 58:27.109
Made sure
he was dead, whoa

58:27.184 --> 58:30.017
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

58:30.086 --> 58:33.783
Came down upon his head

58:33.857 --> 58:36.621
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer

58:36.693 --> 58:39.127
Made sure he was dead

58:39.196 --> 58:42.029
Wh-wh-wh-whoa

58:42.098 --> 58:44.032
Whoa

58:44.100 --> 58:47.160
Whoa-o-whoa

58:47.237 --> 58:50.172
Whoa-o-whoa

58:50.240 --> 58:53.209
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

01:00:20.163 --> 01:00:23.189
<i>Well, they had</i>
<i>Sergeant Pepper's silver cornet.</i>

01:00:23.266 --> 01:00:25.359
<i>One down, three to go.</i>

01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:28.996
<i>Jubilant, they returned to the</i>
<i>Computerettes for additional guidance.</i>

01:00:29.072 --> 01:00:31.438
One down, three to go.

01:00:31.508 --> 01:00:33.533
<i>The bass drum was easy.</i>

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:35.976
<i>Mustard left it,</i>
<i>Billy found it.</i>

01:00:36.046 --> 01:00:38.674
Shh!

01:00:38.748 --> 01:00:40.739
<i>Just like that.</i>

01:00:40.817 --> 01:00:44.878
Congratulations. Two down, two to go.

01:00:44.955 --> 01:00:49.892
<i>They hugged each other</i>
<i>andjumped forjoy, some of them.</i>

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.487
<i>Let's go back to work.</i>
<i>There's still two instruments missing.</i>

01:00:58.401 --> 01:01:01.268
Take the tuba to Father Sun.

01:01:04.674 --> 01:01:07.643
<i>Marvin Sunk,</i>
<i>now known as Father Sun,</i>

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:11.442
<i>was an unemployed school-crossing</i>
<i>guard at the bottom ofhis life...</i>

01:01:11.514 --> 01:01:15.678
<i>when he suddenly got the idea</i>
<i>to drop the ''K''from his last name.</i>

01:01:15.752 --> 01:01:19.188
<i>Well, that move lit up his life</i>
<i>and it's been uphill ever since.</i>

01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:21.587
<i>He decided to go</i>
<i>into the media business...</i>

01:01:21.658 --> 01:01:24.354
<i>and help destroy the minds</i>
<i>of those young people...</i>

01:01:24.427 --> 01:01:26.861
<i>who teased him</i>
<i>on their way to school.</i>

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:32.300
<i>Now he was busy brainwashing</i>
<i>them for F. V.B. to build an army</i>
<i>to take over the world.</i>

01:01:33.436 --> 01:01:36.132
We hate love!

01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:38.572
We hate joy!

01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:41.007
We love money!

01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:44.638
We hate love!
We hate joy!

01:01:45.248 --> 01:01:46.840

<i>Ahh ahh</i>

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:18.906
Because the world is round

01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:21.815
It turns me on

01:02:26.456 --> 01:02:29.391
Because

01:02:29.459 --> 01:02:32.121
The world

Is round

Because the wind is high

01:02:48.678 --> 01:02:51.511
It blows my mind

01:02:56.019 --> 01:02:58.954

Love is all
Love is you, sweetie

01:03:24.948 --> 01:03:26.882

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.044
The sky is blue

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.385
It makes me cry

01:03:37.527 --> 01:03:40.394
Because

01:03:40.463 --> 01:03:42.897
The sky

01:03:42.966 --> 01:03:45.059
Is blue

<i>Could Billy survive</i>

01:05:06.616 --> 01:05:09.847
<i>It was a lot more than normally</i>

01:05:09.919 --> 01:05:11.853
<i>Frankly, he was shocked.</i>

01:05:11.921 --> 01:05:17.689
<i>Stunned and unconscious, only the power</i>

01:05:27.303 --> 01:05:29.931
Let me take you down

Strawberry Fields forever

01:05:50.593 --> 01:05:55.087
Living is easy

Misunderstanding all you see

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:05.537
It's getting hard to be
someone but it all works out

01:06:05.608 --> 01:06:09.271
It doesn't matter much to me

sometimes think it's me

But you know I know

01:07:32.695 --> 01:07:37.723
I think I know I mean
Ah yes, but it's all wrong

There was one instrument

and now there
was no way to find it.

01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:51.767
Heartland was in

01:09:08.357 --> 01:09:12.850
<i>But Dougie came up</i>
<i>with a great idea--a giant benefit.</i>

01:09:12.929 --> 01:09:15.420
<i>Musical artists from all over</i>
<i>would come to Heartland...</i>

01:09:15.497 --> 01:09:17.898
<i>for a concert</i>
<i>that would save the town.</i>

01:09:17.966 --> 01:09:21.300
<i>And Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts</i>
<i>Club Band wouldjoin them.</i>

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.804
<i>That was bound to get</i>
<i>the boys back on the road.</i>

01:09:59.242 --> 01:10:02.143
For the benefit of Mr. Kite

01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:05.510
There will be a show tonight
on trampoline

01:10:08.017 --> 01:10:10.178
The Hendersons will all be there

01:10:10.253 --> 01:10:13.313
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair
What a scene

01:10:13.389 --> 01:10:16.381
<i>Over men and horses</i>
<i>hoops and garters</i>

01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:20.156
<i>Lastly through</i>
<i>a hogshead of real fire</i>

01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:24.222
In this way Mr. K
will challenge the world

01:10:28.504 --> 01:10:30.529
The celebrated Mr. K

01:10:30.606 --> 01:10:34.474
Performs his feat on Saturday
at Bishop's Gate

01:10:36.546 --> 01:10:38.707
The Hendersons
will dance and sing

01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:42.308
As Mr. Kite flies through
the ring, don't be late

01:10:42.385 --> 01:10:44.785
Messrs. K and H assure the public

01:10:44.854 --> 01:10:47.652
Their production
will be second to none

01:10:49.058 --> 01:10:52.186
And of course Henry the Horse
dances the waltz

01:11:20.957 --> 01:11:22.891
<i>The band begins at 10 to 6.00</i>

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:26.395
<i>When Mr. Kperforms his tricks</i>
<i>without a sound</i>

01:11:29.098 --> 01:11:31.032
And Mr. H
will demonstrate

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.965
Ten somersets
he'll undertake

01:11:33.035 --> 01:11:35.026
On solid ground

01:11:35.104 --> 01:11:37.231
Having been some days
in preparation

01:11:37.306 --> 01:11:41.037
A splendid time
is guaranteed for all

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:44.443
And tonight, Mr. Kite is
topping the bill

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.968
<i>Testing.!</i>

01:13:51.674 --> 01:13:56.577
You never give me
your money

01:13:56.645 --> 01:14:03.107
You only give me
your funny paper

01:14:03.185 --> 01:14:08.020
And in the middle
of negotiations

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:11.526
You break down

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:19.791
I never give you my number

01:14:19.869 --> 01:14:25.330
I only give you my situation

01:14:25.407 --> 01:14:30.435
And in the middle
of investigation

01:14:30.513 --> 01:14:34.108
I break down

01:14:36.519 --> 01:14:41.650
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent

01:14:41.724 --> 01:14:44.784
All the money's gone
Nowhere to go

01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:49.561
And a job
I got the sack

01:14:49.632 --> 01:14:52.533
Monday morning
turning back

01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:56.128
Yellow lorry slow
Nowhere to go

01:14:57.506 --> 01:15:01.806
Oh, that magic feeling

01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:04.641
Nowhere to go

01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:09.878
Oh, that magic feeling

01:15:09.952 --> 01:15:13.786
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

01:15:44.053 --> 01:15:46.783
One sweet dream

01:15:48.023 --> 01:15:51.891
Pick up the bags
Get in a limousine

01:15:53.329 --> 01:15:55.889
Soon we'll be
away from here

01:15:55.965 --> 01:15:59.924
Step on the gas
and wipe that tear away

01:16:00.002 --> 01:16:01.867
One sweet dream

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:06.067
Came true today

01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:11.543

I didn't know what
I would find there

01:18:56.311 --> 01:18:58.609
Another road where maybe I

01:32:06.134 --> 01:32:10.662
<i>Sleep, pretty darling</i>
<i>do not cry</i>

01:32:12.574 --> 01:32:17.238
And I will sing a lullaby

01:32:18.913 --> 01:32:23.941
<i>Boy,you're gonna</i>
<i>carry that weight</i>

01:32:24.018 --> 01:32:28.580
<i>Carry that weight</i>
<i>a long time</i>

01:32:29.858 --> 01:32:35.353
<i>Boy,you're gonna</i>
<i>carry that weight</i>

01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:39.992
<i>Carry that weight</i>
<i>a long time</i>

01:33:23.645 --> 01:33:29.015
<i>Boy,you're gonna</i>
<i>carry that weight</i>

01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:33.486
<i>Carry that weight</i>
<i>a long time</i>

01:33:34.756 --> 01:33:40.388
<i>Boy,you're gonna</i>
<i>carry that weight</i>

01:33:40.461 --> 01:33:44.864
<i>Carry that weight</i>
<i>a long time</i>

01:33:46.134 --> 01:33:51.572
<i>Boy,you're gonna</i>
<i>carry that weight</i>

01:33:51.639 --> 01:33:56.099
<i>Carry that weight</i>
<i>a long time</i>

01:34:06.387 --> 01:34:09.584
<i>The instruments</i>
<i>were safely back in Heartland,</i>

01:34:09.657 --> 01:34:11.852
<i>but at what a cost.</i>

01:34:11.926 --> 01:34:13.689
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

01:34:13.761 --> 01:34:17.993
<i>Could anything or anyone make</i>
<i>everything all right again in Heartland?</i>

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.396
<i>The wild and windy night</i>

01:34:57.405 --> 01:35:00.340
<i>That the rain</i>

01:35:00.408 --> 01:35:03.206
<i>Washed away</i>

01:35:06.381 --> 01:35:09.942
<i>Has left a pool of tears</i>

01:35:12.387 --> 01:35:16.585
<i>Crying for the day</i>

01:35:19.027 --> 01:35:22.588
<i>Why leave me standing here</i>

01:35:25.166 --> 01:35:29.500
<i>Let me know the way</i>

01:35:30.505 --> 01:35:33.599
<i>Many times I've been alone</i>

01:35:33.674 --> 01:35:36.802
<i>And many times I've cried</i>

01:35:36.878 --> 01:35:42.714
<i>Anyway you'll never know</i>
<i>the many ways I've tried</i>

01:35:42.784 --> 01:35:47.778
<i>But still they lead me back</i>

01:35:47.855 --> 01:35:53.987
<i>To the long</i>
<i>and winding road</i>

01:35:57.198 --> 01:36:00.827
<i>You left me standing here</i>

01:36:03.438 --> 01:36:08.068
<i>A long, long time ago, ohh</i>

01:36:09.911 --> 01:36:13.574
<i>Don't leave me waiting here</i>

01:36:15.817 --> 01:36:21.585
<i>Lead me to your door</i>

01:36:38.239 --> 01:36:41.868
<i>You left me standing here</i>

01:36:43.544 --> 01:36:48.880
<i>A long, long time ago, ohh</i>

01:36:50.351 --> 01:36:54.344
<i>Don't leave me waiting here</i>

01:36:56.691 --> 01:37:01.287
<i>Lead me to your door</i>

01:37:22.783 --> 01:37:27.243
I read the news today
Oh, boy

01:37:29.223 --> 01:37:33.819
About a lucky man
who made the grade

01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:39.498
And though the news
was rather sad

01:37:41.936 --> 01:37:45.702
Well, I just had to laugh

01:37:48.442 --> 01:37:52.640
I saw the photograph

01:37:54.882 --> 01:37:58.875
He blew his mind out in a car

01:38:01.322 --> 01:38:06.487
He hadn't noticed that
the lights had changed

01:38:07.762 --> 01:38:11.823
A crowd of people
stood and stared

01:38:14.268 --> 01:38:16.896
They'd seen his face before

01:38:16.971 --> 01:38:22.739
Nobody was really sure if he
was from the House of Lords

01:38:23.878 --> 01:38:28.645
I saw a film today
Oh, boy

01:38:30.451 --> 01:38:35.013
The English Army
had just won the war

01:38:36.624 --> 01:38:40.720
A crowd of people turned away

01:38:42.997 --> 01:38:46.524
But I just had to look

01:38:46.601 --> 01:38:51.595
Having read the book

01:38:51.672 --> 01:38:53.663
I'd love to

01:38:53.741 --> 01:38:56.733
Turn you

01:38:56.811 --> 01:39:00.872
On

01:39:13.294 --> 01:39:16.354
<i>Woke up</i>
<i>Fell out ofbed</i>

01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:19.297
<i>Dragged a comb</i>
<i>across my head</i>

01:39:21.369 --> 01:39:24.532
<i>Found my way downstairs</i>
<i>and drank a cup</i>

01:39:24.605 --> 01:39:27.938
<i>Looking up</i>
<i>I noticed I was late</i>

01:39:29.076 --> 01:39:31.636
<i>Found my coat</i>
<i>I grabbed my hat</i>

01:39:31.712 --> 01:39:34.476
<i>Made the bus in seconds flat</i>

01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:39.783
<i>Found my way upstairs</i>
<i>and had a smoke</i>

01:39:39.854 --> 01:39:43.085
<i>Somebody spoke</i>
<i>and I went into a dream</i>

01:39:43.157 --> 01:39:47.457
Ahh ahh ahh

01:39:48.496 --> 01:39:51.488
Ahh ahh ahh

01:39:51.565 --> 01:39:55.399
Ahh ahh ahh

01:39:55.469 --> 01:39:58.666
Ahh

01:39:58.739 --> 01:40:01.765

01:40:01.842 --> 01:40:03.833
Ahh

01:40:03.911 --> 01:40:07.108

01:40:07.181 --> 01:40:11.015
Ahh ahh ahh

01:40:14.288 --> 01:40:18.782
I read the news today
Oh, boy

01:40:20.695 --> 01:40:25.098
Four thousand holes
in Blackburn, Lancashire

01:40:26.834 --> 01:40:30.634
And though the holes
were rather small

01:40:33.007 --> 01:40:35.737
They had to count them all

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:41.476
Now they know how many holes
it takes to fill the Albert Hall

01:40:41.549 --> 01:40:43.608
I'd love to

01:40:43.684 --> 01:40:49.520

JoJo was a man
who thought he was a loner

01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.528
But he knew
it wouldn't last

01:42:06.801 --> 01:42:10.032
JoJo left his home
in Tucson, Arizona

01:42:10.104 --> 01:42:13.596
<i>For some California grass</i>

Sweet Loretta Martin
thought she was a woman

01:42:32.593 --> 01:42:35.118
But she was another man

01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:39.966
All the girls around
said she's got it coming

01:42:40.034 --> 01:42:43.435
But she gets it
while she can

<i>Get a dose ofher</i>

<i>She's killer-diller when</i>
<i>she's dressed to the hilt</i>

01:47:46.306 --> 01:47:48.866
<i>She's the kind of a girl that</i>
<i>makes the</i> News of the World

01:47:48.942 --> 01:47:52.207
<i>Yeah,you could say</i>
<i>she was attractively built</i>

01:47:52.279 --> 01:47:54.406
<i>Yeah,yeah,yeah</i>

01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:06.621
<i>She came in through</i>

<i>Protected by a silver spoon</i>

01:48:14.535 --> 01:48:18.437

<i>By the banks</i>
<i>ofher own lagoon</i>

01:48:22.309 --> 01:48:25.642

<i>Sunday's on the phone to Monday</i>

<i>She said she'd</i>

<i>She worked at 15 clubs a day</i>

<i>Well, I knew</i>
<i>but I could not say</i>

01:49:01.315 --> 01:49:04.648
