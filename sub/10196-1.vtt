01:05.239 --> 01:08.926
What is this disgusting?
And you call her dinner?

01:09.120 --> 01:12.488
I work all day for you
and what do you do?

01:12.680 --> 01:16.651
- Yes, you do it with that bitch!
- Excuse me, what did you say?

01:16.840 --> 01:20.845
If you have something to say, speak aloud!
And then look at this house!

01:21.040 --> 01:23.725
All those colors and those
sheets on the floor!

01:23.920 --> 01:26.526
- Where's Tom? Tom!
- I'm going to look for him.

01:28.199 --> 01:30.725
Tommy! Are you in here?

01:31.599 --> 01:33.601
- Mom!
- Come here.

01:34.599 --> 01:37.045
Do not worry, we will not punish you.

01:38.479 --> 01:42.279
- Stop hiding!
- Tom, your father wants to talk to you.

01:42.479 --> 01:44.481
I told you to go out!

01:44.999 --> 01:46.967
I said to come out!

01:47.159 --> 01:49.400
Get out of there, little monster!

01:49.599 --> 01:52.125
- What are you doing there?
- You lied to me '?

01:52.319 --> 01:55.528
I told you to collect everything,
but you never listen!

01:55.719 --> 01:58.120
He lied to you, so what?

01:58.919 --> 02:02.526
- You will always be a failure!
- Stop Please! No!

02:04.039 --> 02:05.643
That's enough!

02:06.319 --> 02:08.970
Tom, how did you get these bruises?

02:09.158 --> 02:11.366
I fell while playing.

02:11.998 --> 02:15.366
- And these signs on the arms?
- I do not know.

02:15.998 --> 02:18.649
Open this door!
Exit immediately from here!

02:18.838 --> 02:20.647
And why should I?

02:21.078 --> 02:23.888
- Come here, I'll blow you up!
- I hate you!

02:24.078 --> 02:26.240
My God, I kill him!

02:27.638 --> 02:30.005
You will not hurt me anymore!

02:30.198 --> 02:31.802
Never again!

02:35.518 --> 02:37.202
I'm sorry...

02:37.678 --> 02:39.442
mom.

02:40.958 --> 02:43.325
I did not want to, I'm sorry.

02:43.518 --> 02:46.567

APPROVED APPROVED
RELEASE PROPOSAL

03:16.557 --> 03:18.286
Let me in.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.758
Are there any messages for me?

03:31.837 --> 03:33.885
Watch out for the cigarette!

03:38.037 --> 03:39.926
208.

03:44.916 --> 03:46.600
There is this.

03:47.596 --> 03:49.997
This is from the hospital.

03:50.916 --> 03:54.318
The hospital called you
to make an appointment.

03:54.516 --> 03:57.838
The pharmacy wants you
to go get the medicine.

03:58.036 --> 04:02.041
The boss said that if you do not pay
by tomorrow, he'll throw you out.

04:03.716 --> 04:07.926
I have a check, it's from the hospital.
Can you change it?

04:08.116 --> 04:11.643
If you want to change it, go to
the bank and do not break up!

04:12.236 --> 04:15.445
I told you to be careful
with that cigarette!

04:20.755 --> 04:22.360
Sorry...

04:22.556 --> 04:24.081
Sorry.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.085
Sorry.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.125
I lost control for a moment.

04:31.315 --> 04:33.124
Now everything is fine.

04:35.235 --> 04:37.397
That's just crazy!

04:41.915 --> 04:44.156
I have to check myself.

05:00.995 --> 05:03.396
John, can you let me in?

05:08.314 --> 05:09.918
Hi Tom.

05:11.914 --> 05:13.916
Be good, Tom.

05:22.914 --> 05:25.440
How old are you in this design?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.596
Seven or eight.

05:29.314 --> 05:31.203
And where are you?

05:31.394 --> 05:33.396
Under the sink.

05:34.394 --> 05:35.919
IT IS COMFORTABLE.

05:36.274 --> 05:38.880
Comfortable? Under the sink?

05:42.474 --> 05:44.875
My parents could not find me

05:45.074 --> 05:49.124
and if they did not find me, they
would not beat me. I was safe.

05:49.314 --> 05:52.079
Yes, safe. Not comfortable.

05:52.274 --> 05:54.845
Yes, safe! Not comfortable.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.440
Are you safe now?

06:00.153 --> 06:02.554
I have no violent reactions for some time.

06:02.993 --> 06:05.644
I feel that there is hesitation.

06:06.353 --> 06:09.516
NO, no long-time
violent reaction.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.118
Maybe because now
you feel safer.

06:14.153 --> 06:17.839
- I never feel as safe as I would like.
- This does not happen to anyone.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.558
Already.

06:20.473 --> 06:22.521
Let's talk about your future.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.363
Ok.

06:24.553 --> 06:26.123
Where you live now '?

06:28.393 --> 06:31.158
I decided to live in a house.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.314
In a kind of pension '?

06:34.953 --> 06:36.523
Yup.

06:38.512 --> 06:42.915
You know that the mandatory sessions
will be finished next week.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.562
What do you think about it '?

06:52.752 --> 06:54.356
All right.

06:55.392 --> 06:58.794
I believe I have been leaning
on you for too long.

07:01.872 --> 07:04.443
Wait, do not go so strong!

07:09.512 --> 07:11.116
Wait up!

08:44.310 --> 08:46.677
Black with black

08:47.190 --> 08:48.794
it is green

08:49.349 --> 08:51.158
with green.

09:32.429 --> 09:33.999
Hello.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.478
Hi!

10:32.227 --> 10:34.628
- Julie!
- I'm up here!

10:34.827 --> 10:36.556
Julie.

10:38.707 --> 10:41.313
- Where are the guys '?
- I have Holly

10:41.507 --> 10:44.192

Rudolph out of the car.

Come here baby!

10:49.027 --> 10:50.916
Do you like here?

Come on, baby!

11:03.346 --> 11:05.428
- Do you like '?
- Yes, a lot.

11:06.786 --> 11:09.392
- Neil, then?
- I do not like.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.988
- Never ask for the opinion of the children!
- Why do we have to come here?

11:13.186 --> 11:17.077
Because your father did
not like your friends!

11:17.266 --> 11:20.748
- Mom, stop!
- Look, high technology! Hello!

11:21.306 --> 11:23.752
- I can try?
- Sure.

11:23.946 --> 11:25.710
Ready?

11:27.306 --> 11:30.549
- Ready?
- There's another one in the living room.

11:30.746 --> 11:33.431
- Where is it '?
- In the living room, throughout the house.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.708
- Also in the bathroom?
- Yup.

12:02.825 --> 12:04.350
Get out!

12:15.705 --> 12:17.628
Come here.

12:22.425 --> 12:24.154
Come here.

12:32.704 --> 12:34.547
- Beautiful!
- Yes, it's big.

12:34.744 --> 12:36.348
- It is huge!
- Here we go!

12:37.104 --> 12:38.754
Neil, take Rudolph.

12:38.944 --> 12:41.106
- What dinner?
- Get the pizza.

12:41.304 --> 12:44.353
- I'm coming with you!
- Ok. How do you like pizza?

12:44.544 --> 12:46.148
- With salami.
- And you '?

12:46.344 --> 12:49.746
- Cheese!
- Then let's half and half!

12:50.024 --> 12:51.389
Hello!

12:51.584 --> 12:53.268
Hi, Rudy!

13:31.423 --> 13:33.232
Here it is.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.353
Pope!

15:01.341 --> 15:03.150
What was it?

15:03.341 --> 15:04.831
What?

15:05.221 --> 15:07.189
I heard a noise.

15:07.381 --> 15:10.988
The big houses are full of strange
noises, you'll get used to it.

15:24.821 --> 15:26.346
Phil.

15:34.380 --> 15:35.950
Julie.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.547
Neil.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.303
And Holly.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.389
And you, Mr. FÃ¬udolph,

15:54.260 --> 15:56.262
you'll be on the veranda.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.270
Tom.

16:15.179 --> 16:17.466
- Hi dear.
- Hi, honey.

16:23.219 --> 16:27.224
- I have a presentation tomorrow.
- It's our first night here!

16:27.539 --> 16:31.544
The bank must decide tomorrow
whether to invest in this deal.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.865
I'm sorry.

16:36.019 --> 16:37.828
In a little while 'arrival.

17:55.177 --> 17:56.417
Treasure.

17:59.017 --> 18:00.621
What is that '?

18:00.817 --> 18:02.626
A welcome gift.

18:02.817 --> 18:06.026
- I did not get you anything.
- Do not do anything, open it.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.907
Wait up.

18:08.097 --> 18:10.782
A toast. At the new house!

18:11.137 --> 18:12.866
At the new house!

18:20.417 --> 18:23.023
You did it, did not you?

18:24.576 --> 18:27.580
- Do you like '?
- Yes, it's nice.

18:28.576 --> 18:30.385
Really cute.

18:31.256 --> 18:34.260
Tomorrow or Thursday
they come to disinfect.

18:37.096 --> 18:38.621
Tomorrow.

18:39.096 --> 18:41.747
Do not worry, I thought about it.

18:44.016 --> 18:46.018
You're really efficient.

18:46.216 --> 18:47.866
Thank you.

19:03.456 --> 19:06.141
Dear, I think we should sleep.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.903
Come on, Julie! I told you thank you.

19:10.095 --> 19:13.497
I know, it's just that
it's been a long day.

19:14.575 --> 19:16.020
All right.

19:45.695 --> 19:47.379
Come here u.

19:57.774 --> 20:00.095
Hello. Come on, come here.

22:00.172 --> 22:01.981
Mom.

22:03.332 --> 22:05.573
What's up, honey?

22:06.051 --> 22:08.099
A man scared me.

22:08.291 --> 22:11.693
A man '?
You must have dreamed it, love.

22:14.051 --> 22:16.179
Do you want to sleep with me?

22:28.971 --> 22:30.780
Rudolph 1.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.973
- I can not find.
- He does not want to be with us anymore!

22:48.171 --> 22:51.971
Someone will read the plate and bring it
back to us. What do you think about it '?

22:52.170 --> 22:54.377
We did not have to come here!

22:54.570 --> 22:57.574
- Did you see the briefcase?
- He was on the desk.

22:57.770 --> 23:00.091
He was there last night,
but where is he now?

23:01.050 --> 23:02.893
- Hi, George.
- Hello.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.092
- How are you?
- Good.

23:05.650 --> 23:09.450
- Who had put her on the ground?
- Hello. Beautiful house!

23:10.530 --> 23:12.612
- A paradise!
- How nice to see you!

23:12.810 --> 23:16.019
I always say: "If you start from
the top, then it's all down!"

23:16.210 --> 23:19.100
The stairs are from that side.
Make them all out!

23:21.090 --> 23:23.980
Honey, I go.
I'll be late tonight.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.218
- Hi dear.
- Hello guys.

23:26.410 --> 23:27.775
Hi Dad.

24:00.569 --> 24:03.971
How long have you been there?
You can not escape me.

24:04.169 --> 24:06.854
A nice surprise awaits
you, little mouse!

24:25.808 --> 24:28.493
Mice '2 - Yes, they
live in the cavities.

24:28.808 --> 24:31.129
- Can you get rid of it?
- Sure.

24:31.328 --> 24:34.332
But you have to go out for a
couple of hours, it's a big job!

24:34.528 --> 24:37.532
We leave immediately, thanks.
Neil, Holly, let's go!

24:42.528 --> 24:44.212
Ok, mom.

24:45.128 --> 24:47.290
Miss, are you comfortable?

24:47.528 --> 24:48.814
Good.

24:49.008 --> 24:52.091
- It's so exciting!
- Of course, it's your first day.

24:53.048 --> 24:54.459
Hi!

24:55.128 --> 24:58.052
- Hello.
- I'm Gary Hufford.

24:58.248 --> 25:01.252
I live next door,
I'm your neighbor.

25:01.447 --> 25:03.609
A welcome gift.

25:03.807 --> 25:07.653
A rhubarb pie! I did it.

25:07.847 --> 25:12.569
Thanks so much. I'm Julie Dreyer.
They are my children, Neil and Holly.

25:12.767 --> 25:15.373
Hello, glad to meet you!
How are you '?

25:15.567 --> 25:18.776
- You have a beautiful house.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.971
- And then in a nice neighborhood.
- That's right.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.213
There is also a nice pool!

25:28.887 --> 25:30.332
Yup...

25:31.087 --> 25:34.330
Excuse me, now I have to
take the children to school.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.692
I go to kindergarten!

25:36.887 --> 25:40.573
How beautiful!
I'd like to go back to kindergarten!

25:40.767 --> 25:42.576
Maybe with you!

25:42.767 --> 25:45.577
It was a pleasure to meet you!
Enjoy yourselves!

26:52.565 --> 26:54.886
Who are you? What are you doing here?

26:55.085 --> 26:56.894
You're not going anywhere!

28:15.843 --> 28:17.925
What the hell are you doing?

28:20.603 --> 28:22.492
He's drunk!

28:29.323 --> 28:31.849
Hi Tom. When are you coming back '?

28:36.443 --> 28:38.650
It took me a long time

28:39.683 --> 28:41.572
after the fire

28:41.763 --> 28:44.334
to understand that it was not my fault.

28:45.842 --> 28:47.844
They forced me.

28:48.922 --> 28:51.493
It was a terrible experience.

28:52.242 --> 28:54.848
But why are you talking about it now?

29:01.082 --> 29:05.087
I want it not to happen again.
Why should he?

29:09.562 --> 29:11.883
If they were to attack my home,

29:12.842 --> 29:14.970
then I should defend myself.

29:21.122 --> 29:23.124
Excuse me a moment.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.605
Dr. Spencer, can we see
each other a minute?

29:33.081 --> 29:34.651
Yup.

29:35.321 --> 29:37.323
- Sorry.
- It 'does not matter.

29:37.721 --> 29:40.725
- So, do you like the new house?
- Very.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.607
Do you get along with others'?

29:45.281 --> 29:48.285
There is a family that lives
there and I really like it.

29:48.721 --> 29:51.725
They make me want
to have a family.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.442
Maybe one day you'll have it.

29:54.841 --> 29:56.650
I'm thinking about it.

30:00.921 --> 30:03.288
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Ok.

30:05.361 --> 30:07.967
- Dr. Gordon.
- Hello. Thank you.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.723
There's Tom Sykes in there.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.526
Today was supposed
to be his last day.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.084
But I do not know, I have a
strange feeling about the boy.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.681
Today it seems a lot more paranoid...

30:20.080 --> 30:23.721
Without evidence that it is a
danger to himself or others

30:23.920 --> 30:25.922
we can not hold it back.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.531
I KNOW.

30:27.720 --> 30:31.042
But this boy has been mistreated
by his parents for years.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.607
Yes, he has made progress.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.761
But we're talking about a
boy who set fire at home

30:37.960 --> 30:40.361
burning his parents alive.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.370
Dr. Gordon, we have
our hands tied.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.651
All right.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.883
I just wanted to ask.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.969
Good day, doctor.

30:57.359 --> 31:01.444
So, Tom.
This is our last session.

31:01.639 --> 31:03.209
Already.

31:04.279 --> 31:08.284
Tom, do you feel ready
to live on your own?

31:13.919 --> 31:16.081
I'm doing my best.

31:17.639 --> 31:19.368
My best.

31:32.199 --> 31:35.646
Ok, so let's go to Mr.
Patrick at eleven.

31:35.919 --> 31:39.526
We bring the bikes there and
put the stuff in a paper bag.

31:39.718 --> 31:42.722
Then we set fire to the
envelope and ring the bell.

31:42.918 --> 31:45.125
As soon as they open the
mat will catch fire.

31:45.318 --> 31:47.719
Is this the dog poop joke?

31:47.998 --> 31:49.841
Dog poop?

31:50.278 --> 31:53.919
No, it's the joke of dog shit.
You are new, are not you?

31:54.118 --> 31:56.200
Yes, we just moved.

31:56.398 --> 31:59.049
Who taught you to interrupt?

31:59.238 --> 32:01.639
- Nobody.
- And why did you do it?

32:02.318 --> 32:04.719
That's why, you have big ears!

32:26.437 --> 32:30.442
Sleep, my love. Do not Cry!

32:32.117 --> 32:35.121
I'll sing you a lullaby.

32:35.797 --> 32:37.367
Bra goes!

32:37.557 --> 32:39.207
Now you sleep.

32:39.437 --> 32:41.246
Do you want a kiss '?

32:42.477 --> 32:44.479
Good night little one.

32:52.837 --> 32:55.158
- I do not like it there.
- Because?

32:55.357 --> 32:58.520
There's a kid named Bernard
who treats me badly.

32:58.717 --> 33:01.163
You're new to that school.

33:01.357 --> 33:04.566
Sometimes it takes
some time to adapt.

33:05.637 --> 33:07.924
Can not go to the old school?

33:08.196 --> 33:10.961
We no longer live in
that neighborhood.

33:11.156 --> 33:14.558
I do not care, I
miss my friends.

33:14.836 --> 33:16.406
I KNOW.

33:16.956 --> 33:20.244
I know how hard the first day
of school is, I remember.

33:20.436 --> 33:24.441
But everything will be fine.
You'll make new friends, you'll see.

33:26.436 --> 33:28.040
Agree?

33:32.196 --> 33:33.766
Good night.

33:37.156 --> 33:38.567
Goodnight Mom.

33:39.076 --> 33:40.760
Sweet dreams.

33:41.196 --> 33:43.722
- I love you.
- Me too.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.918
I love you too.

33:51.355 --> 33:53.517
I love you too.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.999
Goodnight Mom.

34:01.035 --> 34:02.799
Goodnight Mom.

34:04.475 --> 34:06.239
I love you too.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.476
You made me take a shot!

34:37.674 --> 34:41.838
- Excuse me, I heard you enter.
- And you have to get behind me like that?

34:42.353 --> 34:44.755
I did not get behind you.

34:45.353 --> 34:48.563
- What's up '?
- I had a shitty day.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.643
- Why '?
- I was presenting the report

34:51.833 --> 34:53.484
on the Davis project.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.042
I'm coming to the end and
when I'm about to take stock,

34:57.234 --> 35:00.875
I realize that the sheet
containing the total is gone.

35:01.074 --> 35:03.395
- Thing?
- Disappeared!

35:03.794 --> 35:07.003
I was there in front of eleven
people to look like an idiot!

35:07.194 --> 35:10.323
- How could it have happened?
- Good question!

35:10.514 --> 35:12.960
Yesterday evening it
was all on the desk...

35:13.154 --> 35:17.159
before you moved 24 hours.
I have not touched your 24 hours.

35:17.714 --> 35:19.523
The boys were sleeping.

35:19.713 --> 35:22.284
Do you think she moved alone?

35:22.473 --> 35:25.477
I do not know what happened,
but I did not touch it.

35:29.353 --> 35:30.923
Dear,

35:31.473 --> 35:34.682
you had a difficult
day, let's go to bed.

35:34.873 --> 35:37.080
I can not, I have to work.

35:40.433 --> 35:43.915
So I should talk to you about
something before tomorrow morning.

35:44.113 --> 35:46.161
- Thing '?
- The landlord called...

35:46.353 --> 35:48.276
The House!

35:48.473 --> 35:51.204
Julie, please!
We do not talk about the house!

35:51.393 --> 35:53.760
I'm sick of talking about the house!

35:53.953 --> 35:57.241
I'm not even sure
we can afford it!

35:57.433 --> 35:59.435
- Should I go back to work?
- No.

35:59.633 --> 36:03.001
I know you have to be with
children, I'm not saying this.

36:03.193 --> 36:05.195
Calm down, do not scream.

36:05.392 --> 36:07.793
I'm not screaming, damn it!

36:10.232 --> 36:12.473
I do not understand what's happening.

36:12.672 --> 36:14.913
And that's the problem!

36:15.752 --> 36:17.754
- What do you mean?
- Leave it.

36:17.952 --> 36:21.274
If there's a problem, I'd
like to know what it is.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.918
Do you want to know what the problem is?

36:24.112 --> 36:26.797
You only think about this stupid house

36:26.992 --> 36:29.472
and neglect the family.
And I'm fed up!

36:29.672 --> 36:32.198
Did you think that moving was easy?

36:32.392 --> 36:36.113
I'm not talking about moving,
I was there when we did it!

36:36.312 --> 36:39.759
I do not want to hear details
of all the workers I discuss.

36:39.952 --> 36:43.354
- Did not I help you with the move?
- I'm not saying this.

36:43.552 --> 36:45.122
That's enough!

36:45.312 --> 36:48.316
Is not it enough that I
pay for this damn house?

36:48.511 --> 36:50.036
All right!

37:14.151 --> 37:15.676
Not bad!

37:18.071 --> 37:20.233
- Guys! How are you '?
- Good.

37:20.431 --> 37:23.241
- Beautiful house.
- Thank you. Take something.

37:25.151 --> 37:26.641
Michael!

37:26.831 --> 37:29.072
- You're beautiful!
- Thank you.

37:29.991 --> 37:32.801
Julie, did you start
the party without me?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.199
- Phil!
- How are you?

37:47.310 --> 37:48.914
Hello!

37:54.430 --> 37:58.037
So, what is this'?
It must be hung on the wall '?

37:58.230 --> 37:59.641
Rita!

37:59.990 --> 38:02.152
Holly, honey!

38:06.630 --> 38:09.395
New house, new neighbors!

38:09.910 --> 38:12.516
- How are you '?
- Great!

38:13.350 --> 38:15.478
I'm glad I recommended you.

38:15.750 --> 38:17.991
Julie did a great job.

38:18.189 --> 38:19.554
Thank you.

38:19.749 --> 38:21.911
You seem destroyed.

38:22.869 --> 38:24.359
What happens?

38:24.549 --> 38:26.711
I think I'll see her again.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.198
Are you kidding?

38:29.589 --> 38:31.796
I thought it was just an escapade.

38:31.989 --> 38:33.991
- I KNOW.
- So?

38:35.629 --> 38:40.032
Sometimes I would like to close this
story before it becomes too serious.

38:40.989 --> 38:42.639
But sometimes

38:42.829 --> 38:45.833
I feel like wanting
something for me.

38:46.029 --> 38:47.030
Do you understand?

38:50.389 --> 38:51.914
The only thing...

38:52.109 --> 38:54.111
Neil, get out of here!

38:54.869 --> 38:56.871
You are very nervous.

38:57.949 --> 38:59.951
Maybe you're right.

39:01.108 --> 39:04.112
The other night I could
not even thank Julie

39:04.308 --> 39:06.310
for a gift that made me.

39:08.828 --> 39:10.512
I can not believe.

39:11.468 --> 39:13.311
I can not believe.

39:19.108 --> 39:21.110
Where will you meet?

39:22.508 --> 39:24.112
At the Century.

40:48.226 --> 40:49.830
Thank you.

41:25.945 --> 41:28.346
- Good day.
- Do not you have breakfast?

41:28.545 --> 41:30.547
- It's late.
- Why such a rush?

41:30.745 --> 41:33.555
I have a lot of things to do.
I have to go, baby.

42:25.984 --> 42:27.986
I have to go, baby.

42:59.943 --> 43:01.945
- Mrs. Dreyer?
- Yup.

43:02.143 --> 43:04.589
I'm Frank Reed, a
Phil colleague.

43:04.783 --> 43:09.072
He had to run away, but he asked me
to tell her to join him for lunch.

43:09.263 --> 43:10.788
Really '? When '?

43:10.983 --> 43:13.463
Now, at the Valentino restaurant.

43:15.583 --> 43:17.233
At the Hotel Century.

43:17.463 --> 43:19.830
Good! Thank you for calling.

43:20.023 --> 43:21.513
Goodbye.

43:34.582 --> 43:36.505
- Can I help you '?
- Yup.

43:36.702 --> 43:40.104
I'm waiting for my wife. Her name is
Julie Dreyer, she is tall like that

43:40.302 --> 43:43.112
and has red hair.
Can you give this message '?

43:43.302 --> 43:45.066
- Sure.
- Thank you.

43:47.502 --> 43:49.504
I would like a nice coffee.

44:44.661 --> 44:46.072
Can I help you?

44:46.261 --> 44:49.470
I'm really looking for my
husband, but I do not see him.

44:49.661 --> 44:51.948
- What's his name '?
- Phil Dreyer.

44:53.061 --> 44:55.268
He left her this.

44:57.220 --> 45:01.862
I AM IN THE ROOM 1534, THE KEY IS
AT THE RECEPTION. HURRY, I LOVE YOU

45:02.660 --> 45:04.662
- Thank you.
- Imagine yourself.

45:19.420 --> 45:22.230
And I thought
romanticism was over!

45:24.580 --> 45:26.230
Fuck, Julie!

45:31.060 --> 45:32.869
Julie, wait!

45:49.899 --> 45:51.663
Julie, listen...

45:52.579 --> 45:55.549
- We need to talk.
- There's nothing to say!

45:58.659 --> 46:01.469
- What are you doing '?
- I'll throw you out of the house!

46:01.659 --> 46:05.061
You can not do this!
My love I'm sorry. I was wrong.

46:05.259 --> 46:08.468
A big mistake!
I want you out of here!

46:08.659 --> 46:10.741
This is also my home!

46:10.939 --> 46:13.021
Love, please, let's talk!

46:13.219 --> 46:16.621
I do not want to see you or talk to you.
Do not approach, go away!

46:17.379 --> 46:19.188
Get out of here u.

46:23.178 --> 46:25.180
Please listen to me!

46:36.978 --> 46:38.787
I have to go, baby!

47:13.497 --> 47:16.307
So, guys, things are like that.

47:18.457 --> 47:21.301
Your father and I had
a fight and so...

47:22.057 --> 47:24.185
we have to stay away for a while.

47:26.457 --> 47:28.858
Why did you get angry?

47:30.137 --> 47:32.822
You know when you and Neil fight

47:33.017 --> 47:35.384
and then you do not talk
to you for a while?

47:37.497 --> 47:39.977
Sometimes adults also fight.

47:41.297 --> 47:43.425
Dad teased you?

47:44.617 --> 47:48.224
Yes honey. And it bothered
me just like you.

47:50.377 --> 47:54.143
- Where it went '?
- He'll stay with a friend for a while.

47:54.656 --> 47:57.023
Why did he have to go?

47:58.296 --> 48:00.902
Your father and I must
clarify some things.

48:01.896 --> 48:05.537
But you do not have to worry,
everything will settle.

48:06.456 --> 48:08.663
Did he go to Rudolph?

48:10.696 --> 48:12.505
I do not believe, honey.

51:03.012 --> 51:04.582
Mom!

51:07.412 --> 51:09.414
Mom, are you awake?

51:15.372 --> 51:17.773
Mom! Do you get up or up?

51:25.932 --> 51:28.856
Go downstairs and make
cereals for your sister.

51:29.052 --> 51:31.658
- Can not do it alone?
- Give it a straight line!

51:40.971 --> 51:42.860
Oh God!

51:45.931 --> 51:47.581
Mom!

51:53.091 --> 51:54.900
Holly, what's up?

51:55.451 --> 51:58.455
Neil says dad will
never come back home.

51:59.131 --> 52:00.940
MY LITTLE IS.

52:01.331 --> 52:04.540
- Neil, why are you doing this?
- But it's the truth!

52:04.731 --> 52:06.972
No, I told you last night.

52:07.171 --> 52:09.777
We just have to clarify some things.

52:10.131 --> 52:12.702
It's all right, honey. It's not true.

52:13.291 --> 52:15.293
Everything will be fixed.

52:15.531 --> 52:19.331
Now please, go downstairs
for breakfast.

52:21.490 --> 52:23.140
- Neil.
- What's up '?

52:23.730 --> 52:27.337
Remember that I come to pick you up
at 3 to take you to the dentist.

53:48.128 --> 53:49.937
Look, there's Neil.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.379
- Neil, do you still wear diapers?
- Asshole.

53:55.968 --> 53:59.097
What did you say?
Did you call me an asshole?

53:59.288 --> 54:01.097
You're a fucking head.

54:18.728 --> 54:20.412
Come here.

54:20.608 --> 54:22.815
- What happens?
- Leave me!

54:23.008 --> 54:26.012
Mom, I'm fine!
Everyone is watching us!

54:28.847 --> 54:30.212
Thank you.

54:30.407 --> 54:32.330
- Tom Sykes.
- Julie Dreyer.

54:32.527 --> 54:35.417
- His children come here?
- No, I passed by chance.

54:35.607 --> 54:37.928
I went home and saw the quarrel.

54:38.127 --> 54:41.131
- Bernard started.
- We'll talk about it at home.

54:41.327 --> 54:43.409
Bernard started, I saw him.

54:44.127 --> 54:46.653
- Thanks again, Mr. Sykes.
- Tom!

54:46.967 --> 54:47.968
Thanks, Tom.

54:48.327 --> 54:51.331
- He was very kind.
- I did what I could.

54:51.527 --> 54:53.177
- Here we go '?
- Yup.

54:53.367 --> 54:55.210
- Pleasure.
- Goodbye.

54:55.407 --> 54:56.818
Hi, Neil.

54:59.127 --> 55:01.129
Mom, how do you know my name?

55:01.327 --> 55:04.536
- He will have heard you say it.
- No, I did not say it.

55:04.727 --> 55:07.298
Then he will have heard
it from someone else.

55:08.247 --> 55:10.056
"Dear Julie,"

55:10.487 --> 55:14.287
today it was a pleasure to
meet her and protect her son

55:14.486 --> 55:16.488
from the school's bullet.

55:17.206 --> 55:19.812
If I can do anything
to help you,

55:20.006 --> 55:22.213
"do not hesitate to contact me at..."

55:26.606 --> 55:28.608
To contact me at...

55:35.886 --> 55:37.411
Here it is.

55:38.086 --> 55:40.612
Come here under the covers.

56:00.165 --> 56:02.452
- Goodnight Mom.
- 'Goodnight, honey.

56:21.245 --> 56:23.816
My goodness! Neil, stay back!

56:38.965 --> 56:41.332
What the hell did you want to do?

56:42.844 --> 56:44.892
- Sorry.
- That's all '?

56:45.084 --> 56:47.564
Ask apologize and everything is settled?

56:48.764 --> 56:51.768
Do you have any idea how
dangerous what you did '?

56:51.964 --> 56:54.968
- You could burn the house and kill us.
- I know.

56:55.164 --> 56:57.053
Why did you do that '?

56:57.244 --> 57:00.248
Explain to me why you
burned the toy soldiers!

57:01.444 --> 57:03.685
I asked you a question!

57:04.364 --> 57:07.368
- I was not burning the soldiers.
- So what were you doing?

57:07.564 --> 57:09.566
I pretended they were daddy!

57:10.324 --> 57:14.329
He does not care about us!
He left us and he will not come back!

57:17.284 --> 57:19.286
No, listen to me!

57:20.364 --> 57:23.129
Honey, look at me. Listen.

57:23.764 --> 57:25.766
Your father loves you.

57:26.843 --> 57:29.449
It would do nothing to hurt you.

57:29.643 --> 57:31.452
You have to believe me!

57:31.963 --> 57:34.170
He does not even call us!

57:35.083 --> 57:37.893
Honey, he had a lot to do.

57:38.523 --> 57:40.048
Yes sure!

57:40.363 --> 57:42.252
You have to believe me.

57:42.563 --> 57:45.885
He would always like to
be with you and Holly.

57:46.763 --> 57:49.209
So why did he leave us?

57:51.603 --> 57:54.413
He left because we had a fight.

57:55.443 --> 57:57.969
I told him to leave.

57:59.123 --> 58:02.923
It's not your fault, honey, you
have nothing to do with it.

58:05.883 --> 58:08.090
I promise you, everything will be fine.

58:09.602 --> 58:11.491
Let's go downstairs.

58:38.922 --> 58:41.323
- Leave it to me!
- No thanks.

58:41.522 --> 58:45.129
It's the least I can do for
a beautiful lady like her!

58:45.322 --> 58:47.893
Whenever he wants, I'm
always here next.

58:48.082 --> 58:50.813
I spend a lot of time alone,

58:51.002 --> 58:52.413
but I'm fine.

58:52.602 --> 58:54.491
Here, put everything there.

58:54.681 --> 58:57.002
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.203
- Mom!
- I'm here.

58:59.401 --> 59:01.642
Look who I met out here.

59:01.841 --> 59:03.411
Hi... Tom, right?

59:03.601 --> 59:05.603
Yes. Hello, Julie.

59:05.801 --> 59:08.645
Neil wanted to offer me a drink for...
As you said '?

59:09.281 --> 59:12.046
- Saving my ass.
- Yeah!

59:12.241 --> 59:13.845
I'll be right away.

59:15.721 --> 59:18.691
- I am in detention.
- Because '?

59:18.881 --> 59:21.202
I played with matches.

59:21.401 --> 59:23.608
Matches are dangerous.

59:24.241 --> 59:26.050
I know for sure.

59:26.241 --> 59:28.369
Neil, go immediately upstairs.

59:28.721 --> 59:32.123
- All right. See you later.
- Yes, see you later.

59:34.241 --> 59:36.243
- Is water okay?
- Yes thanks.

59:36.441 --> 59:39.047
- Do you take something?
- No thanks.

59:39.240 --> 59:41.242
I put the expense in place.

59:41.440 --> 59:43.044
Gary Hufford.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.688
I live in the next house,

59:45.880 --> 59:47.405
I'm the neighbor.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.204
Leave it to me!

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.323
I can do it.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.488
No, I'll take care of it.

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.640
Are you passionate about sports?

01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:38.361
Yes, I'm Julie Dreyer.

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.725
- He saved my ball.
- What's your name?

01:00:45.919 --> 01:00:48.081
- Holly.
- I'm Tom.

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:50.049
Give me your hand.

01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:52.123
Hold on tight!

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.203
Yes, it's strange.

01:00:57.439 --> 01:01:00.568
When I left, he was climbing
upstairs with the equipment.

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:05.721
I wish I could help her.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.443
Goodbye.

01:01:09.838 --> 01:01:11.647
It's all OK '?

01:01:12.238 --> 01:01:17.005
Yes, it was the disinfestation company.
A week ago they came to us.

01:01:17.198 --> 01:01:21.601
They found the van in town, but
he's been missing for days.

01:01:25.718 --> 01:01:30.087
I saw him leave last
week, he was drunk.

01:01:30.278 --> 01:01:33.885
He zigzagged with the
van and nearly crashed.

01:01:34.438 --> 01:01:36.645
- Call them.
- Good idea.

01:01:37.718 --> 01:01:40.085
Call them from your house.

01:01:40.358 --> 01:01:42.964
Yes... I really have to go.

01:01:43.718 --> 01:01:47.040
Play my team.
We are last in the standings,

01:01:47.238 --> 01:01:50.242
but I'm a loyal fan,
I never give up!

01:01:51.277 --> 01:01:53.848
- Goodbye, Mr. Hufford.
- Gary!

01:01:55.437 --> 01:01:57.644
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:01:57.837 --> 01:02:00.761
He saved my ass!
He kept it at bay.

01:02:02.117 --> 01:02:04.006
Please have a seat.

01:02:06.437 --> 01:02:08.758
That man scares me a little.

01:02:08.957 --> 01:02:10.800
I know that spies me.

01:02:11.517 --> 01:02:14.441
- Where does he live '?
- In the next house.

01:02:14.957 --> 01:02:16.959
And where do you live?

01:02:18.477 --> 01:02:20.286
I'm in Woodcliffe.

01:02:20.477 --> 01:02:23.481
Bring your family here,
we will have a barbecue.

01:02:23.677 --> 01:02:25.520
I have no family.

01:02:25.797 --> 01:02:27.208
Then come alone.

01:02:27.717 --> 01:02:30.721
- Are you inviting me?
- Yes, we're doing this weekend.

01:02:30.917 --> 01:02:33.727
We had a welcome party
for old friends,

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.919
but I would like to know new genete.

01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:45.245
Where did he get them?

01:02:45.436 --> 01:02:47.040
I did them.

01:02:47.236 --> 01:02:48.442
Really '?

01:02:51.796 --> 01:02:53.798
- I can?
- Sure.

01:02:55.076 --> 01:02:57.078
It is really beautiful.

01:02:57.276 --> 01:02:58.801
Thank you.

01:02:58.996 --> 01:03:01.397
- Do you like this here?
- Yup.

01:03:01.716 --> 01:03:03.127
Take it.

01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:05.800
- Seriously '?
- Yup.

01:03:06.236 --> 01:03:08.716
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely, I insist.

01:03:17.396 --> 01:03:21.287
I've got this rabbit leg, I've
got it since I was little.

01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:24.081
It means a lot to me. I insist!

01:03:25.395 --> 01:03:27.363
Okay thanks.

01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:32.557
A little luck will make me
comfortable these days.

01:03:33.115 --> 01:03:36.119
- Have you ever thought of selling them?
- NO.

01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:38.921
It would be fun to
see what happens.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.799
Why do not you do it?

01:03:40.995 --> 01:03:42.520
I do not know...

01:03:42.835 --> 01:03:44.883
My husband finds them stupid.

01:03:46.595 --> 01:03:48.802
I do not think they are stupid.

01:03:49.115 --> 01:03:51.402
In my opinion they are very beautiful.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.003
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

01:04:05.954 --> 01:04:07.922
- Rita!
- Julie!

01:04:08.114 --> 01:04:09.525
Hello!

01:04:09.714 --> 01:04:11.318
Come.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.721
- How are you?
- Good.

01:04:17.514 --> 01:04:20.199
I'll introduce you my
friend Rita, he's Tom.

01:04:21.994 --> 01:04:23.644
Pleasure!

01:04:28.914 --> 01:04:31.235
I'd better leave it alone.

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.835
Do not go because of me.

01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:39.683
I really have to go.

01:04:40.114 --> 01:04:42.276
Glad to have met you, Rita.

01:04:45.074 --> 01:04:47.315
- See you, Julie.
- I accompany you.

01:04:50.353 --> 01:04:52.560
- Thanks for the bowl.
- Thanks to you!

01:04:52.753 --> 01:04:54.562
Good, goodbye.

01:05:01.033 --> 01:05:02.558
What's up '?

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.842
And who is he?

01:05:06.033 --> 01:05:09.196
His name is Tom Sykes and he
lives in the neighborhood.

01:05:11.353 --> 01:05:14.118
- It's not like you're thinking.
- And what do I think?

01:05:14.313 --> 01:05:16.315
I know what you're thinking!

01:05:17.273 --> 01:05:19.753
All right, I will not say anything.

01:05:19.953 --> 01:05:22.957
But if you decide that you do not want it,

01:05:24.273 --> 01:05:26.355
I'll be happy to take it from me.

01:05:26.553 --> 01:05:28.317
Thanks, dear!

01:05:29.473 --> 01:05:30.998
What is that '?

01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:48.393
How beautiful the sun is!

01:05:49.392 --> 01:05:51.360
You're in a good mood.

01:05:51.552 --> 01:05:52.883
It's true.

01:05:53.072 --> 01:05:55.678
Maybe Tom has something to do with it?

01:05:56.632 --> 01:05:59.033
He's a good boy, that's all.

01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.236
- That's all '?
- Yes, he's kind and caring.

01:06:02.432 --> 01:06:04.082
He's a good boy.

01:06:04.272 --> 01:06:05.876
You should come out.

01:06:06.072 --> 01:06:08.803
- I hardly know him.
- That's why people come out!

01:06:08.992 --> 01:06:10.835
It is not the right time.

01:06:12.432 --> 01:06:14.673
Phil did not call you, right?

01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:19.641
It's time for you to think about yourself.

01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:27.075
Oh my God, what is it?

01:06:30.591 --> 01:06:32.320
It is Rudolph!

01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:34.640
Oh my God!

01:06:35.551 --> 01:06:38.361
Calm down, I do not want
children to see it.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.521
Here we go.

01:06:48.031 --> 01:06:52.036
Come. I believe I will stay
with you this weekend.

01:06:52.311 --> 01:06:54.712
Yes, it's an animal! Who deals with it?

01:06:56.831 --> 01:06:59.835
Someone killed the dog and
buried it in our garden.

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.034
I am quite upset and I would
like the police to intervene.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.838
But this is an emergency!

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.394
My goodness!

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.194
Then?

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:16.357
An animal buried in private property
does not concern the police!

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:19.838
If I dissect it and show that it
is Rudolph, then they will report.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.634
Bastards!

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.671
- It's too tight '?
- NO.

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.392
Do you like the new house?

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.797
Yes, it's not bad.

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:44.800
I miss old friends
and that road.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:48.196
I'm your new friend.

01:07:48.469 --> 01:07:50.471
Bernard still wants to fight?

01:07:50.669 --> 01:07:53.878
Yes, he takes it
with me every day.

01:07:54.229 --> 01:07:55.958
- Everyday '?
- Yup.

01:07:56.149 --> 01:07:57.958
I'll be back in a minute.

01:07:58.469 --> 01:08:00.278
Put the backpack down.

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:03.191
Do you know why he takes it with you?

01:08:03.389 --> 01:08:05.391
Because he knows you will not react.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:09.754
When I was little, there were
people who brought me every day.

01:08:10.429 --> 01:08:13.194
In the end I could not do
it anymore and I reacted.

01:08:13.429 --> 01:08:15.636
What happened '?

01:08:17.828 --> 01:08:20.116
They no longer hurt me.

01:08:23.629 --> 01:08:25.756
Hi, Tom. Hi, honey.

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:29.154
- Can you fight?
- I think so.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:32.069
The school's bullet!

01:08:32.188 --> 01:08:34.031
Hit your hands.

01:08:36.627 --> 01:08:37.959
Try again.

01:08:39.108 --> 01:08:41.997
You have to keep the guard
high in front of your face.

01:08:42.188 --> 01:08:44.667
Keep your eyes open on me.
Try again.

01:08:46.228 --> 01:08:47.718
Come on!

01:08:48.148 --> 01:08:50.549
- I will never learn!
- It takes time.

01:08:50.747 --> 01:08:53.513
I have no time, Bernard
beats me every day.

01:08:55.828 --> 01:08:57.353
So do it.

01:08:58.068 --> 01:09:00.229
When you're about to fight us,

01:09:00.948 --> 01:09:03.474
give him a strong kick in the balls.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.798
You take him by the hair,
hit him and throw him down.

01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:14.118
A punch in the face so does not get
up and then a good kick in the mouth!

01:09:16.227 --> 01:09:18.594
You'll see that it will
not bother you anymore.

01:09:19.027 --> 01:09:21.029
Neil, go get ready.

01:09:21.227 --> 01:09:22.671
Immediately!

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:24.872
Go.

01:09:26.947 --> 01:09:29.837
Hurry up, in a quarter of an
hour we go to the grandparents.

01:09:30.027 --> 01:09:31.631
- I'll see you!
- Hello.

01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:41.988
Tom, I do not like you
teaching those things to Neil.

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:44.072
It's wrong.

01:09:44.907 --> 01:09:47.716
- Sometimes it's the only way.
- I decide that.

01:09:47.907 --> 01:09:49.477
All right.

01:09:50.827 --> 01:09:53.671
Excuse me, I got carried away.

01:09:57.506 --> 01:09:59.907
I'm sorry. Goodbye..

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:07.748
I know he just wants to help him.

01:10:07.946 --> 01:10:09.516
See you soon.

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.833
- Ready!
- Then we go.

01:10:23.026 --> 01:10:25.757
Grandma made sweet potato cake.

01:10:25.946 --> 01:10:28.756
- What a squalor!
- You are shabby!

01:12:01.504 --> 01:12:03.029
Fuck!

01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:08.594
- What are you doing here?
- I...

01:12:10.703 --> 01:12:12.910
I keep an eye on the house.

01:12:14.903 --> 01:12:18.510
What's wearing?
This is Phil's bathrobe.

01:12:18.703 --> 01:12:20.148
Yup,

01:12:20.463 --> 01:12:22.033
I know.

01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:27.664
I KNOW.

01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:30.912
Phil left.

01:12:33.863 --> 01:12:37.231
- Did Julie talk about the two of us?
- NO.

01:12:38.663 --> 01:12:40.153
Really '?

01:12:45.823 --> 01:12:49.828
Julie needs someone to stay
home when she's not there

01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:51.952
to protect...

01:12:52.623 --> 01:12:55.706
the children. What's he doing here?

01:12:55.902 --> 01:12:59.588
I'm trying to explain them.
Now I live here with Julie...

01:12:59.782 --> 01:13:01.352
If HG Vada.

01:13:05.102 --> 01:13:07.025
Do not scream!

01:13:08.822 --> 01:13:10.631
Please do not shout.

01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:13.506
Do not scream!

01:13:22.462 --> 01:13:24.032
Rita!

01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:27.312
Good ..

01:13:33.662 --> 01:13:35.744
That's better.

01:13:37.101 --> 01:13:38.705
She does not know,

01:13:38.901 --> 01:13:40.790
let me explain.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.307
Casa Dreyer, leave
name and phone number.

01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:16.947
We will call you as soon as possible.

01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:20.903
Julie, it's still me.
I've been calling you all week.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.224
I know you're angry, but you
could at least call me back.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.541
Honey, I'm sorry for what I did.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.061
I miss you, call me back.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.630
I love you.

01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:28.585
"Julie, I miss you.

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:31.623
I'm sorry, I love you so much.
Phil."

01:15:50.938 --> 01:15:52.940
Mom, is Rita here?

01:15:53.138 --> 01:15:56.779
- I do not see your car.
- Maybe Rudolph came home.

01:15:57.218 --> 01:15:58.583
Holly 1.

01:16:02.418 --> 01:16:04.227
One punch, two...

01:16:04.418 --> 01:16:07.228
- Stop that!
- I was joking!

01:16:24.778 --> 01:16:27.019
Damn, everybody's looking for me!

01:16:54.217 --> 01:16:56.902
Hi, I'm Rita.
Leave a short message,

01:16:57.097 --> 01:16:59.065
not the story of your life.

01:16:59.257 --> 01:17:00.907
Rita, where did you go?

01:17:01.097 --> 01:17:05.227
Maybe you're in Mexico with
some guy, but I'm worried.

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:07.818
You have not left a message.

01:17:09.657 --> 01:17:12.058
Rita, damn it! Call me soon!

01:17:52.096 --> 01:17:55.703
I just saw someone in the garden,
help me close the windows.

01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:59.025
- What's he going to do '? Will it rise on the ledge '?
- I'm serious!

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.025
Get up, you have to help me!

01:18:01.216 --> 01:18:03.423
- Where is your sister '?
- I do not know.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.020
Hello Mom.

01:18:30.735 --> 01:18:33.181
I do not want you to play here.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.981
Take the toys and go downstairs.

01:18:36.175 --> 01:18:37.825
All right.

01:19:04.734 --> 01:19:06.463
Hi, Julie.

01:19:06.894 --> 01:19:10.694
I was passing by here and I thought
we could go to the cinema tonight.

01:19:15.614 --> 01:19:18.265
I read that there is a circus in the city.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:20.456
Would you like to... NO?

01:19:21.294 --> 01:19:23.296
Then it will be better for me to go.

01:19:23.494 --> 01:19:25.496
I have to go, baby.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.903
I have to go, baby.

01:19:30.414 --> 01:19:32.815
Julie, let's have a coffee '?

01:19:33.093 --> 01:19:34.902
Hi, Julie.

01:19:35.173 --> 01:19:38.017
I was passing by here and
I thought that tonight

01:19:38.213 --> 01:19:40.295
we could go to the cinema.

01:19:47.493 --> 01:19:50.144
Hi, Neil.
Where's your bodyguard?

01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:54.133
- It's not my bodyguard.
- If he was not there, I would break you.

01:19:54.853 --> 01:19:56.662
Now I'll settle you.

01:19:56.893 --> 01:19:58.463
Get up!

01:20:36.692 --> 01:20:38.421
Oscar!

01:20:40.492 --> 01:20:42.062
What the hell...

01:20:44.812 --> 01:20:47.053
- Yup '?
- Hello.

01:20:48.572 --> 01:20:52.372
I was passing by here, I saw his
car in the courtyard and...

01:20:53.652 --> 01:20:56.656
I thought maybe we could
go to the cinema tonight.

01:20:58.132 --> 01:20:59.463
Damn!

01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:01.653
To tell the truth...

01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:06.692
- I chose a bad time '?
- Yes, I'm a bit dazed.

01:21:07.691 --> 01:21:10.456
- What's wrong '?
- Anything.

01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:13.540
It's strange,

01:21:13.731 --> 01:21:17.292
but it seems to me that our
little fish has grown at night.

01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:21.294
- Fish grow.
- Yes, but this is different.

01:21:21.491 --> 01:21:23.732
I do not think it's the same fish.

01:21:27.651 --> 01:21:31.133
- Maybe that friend who was here...
- Rita? Did you see it?

01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:40.300
So how do you know she was left here?

01:21:40.491 --> 01:21:42.493
I imagined.

01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.732
Julie, let's go to the cinema!

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.410
Tom, thank you. You're very kind,

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.692
but it's not a good time.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.652
Excuse me, I have to go now.

01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.691
I only went to say hello.

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:02.294
I read in the newspaper that
there is a circus in the city.

01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:04.492
Would you come to the circus with me?

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.172
Now I really have to go.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:15.412
Maybe it would be better if you
did not show up for a while.

01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:20.572
Take a coffe '?

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:22.295
- No...
- Yup.

01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:25.213
- Please!
- NO!

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:27.412
- Just a coffee.
- No!

01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:29.253
Please!

01:22:30.569 --> 01:22:32.139
I have to go!

01:22:35.009 --> 01:22:36.579
Please.

01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:53.378
Fuck!

01:23:11.968 --> 01:23:14.175
Julie, you can not do this to me!

01:23:15.088 --> 01:23:16.294
Come on!

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:23.091
Julie, I need to talk to you.

01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:25.939
Tom, I told you not
to come here anymore.

01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:28.779
I know, but I'd like to see you.

01:23:30.568 --> 01:23:34.573
- Julie, open and let me in.
- No! Tom, please, go away.

01:24:19.407 --> 01:24:21.409
And your boyfriend '?

01:24:21.847 --> 01:24:23.656
No not at all.

01:24:23.847 --> 01:24:26.896
He's just one of the strange
characters around here.

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:29.971
What are you doing here '?

01:24:30.487 --> 01:24:34.492
It was the only way to talk to you
since you did not answer my calls.

01:24:34.687 --> 01:24:37.657
- What calls'?
- I called every day...

01:24:37.847 --> 01:24:40.817
and I left a message.
I did not receive it.

01:24:41.006 --> 01:24:43.407
I called him, you must believe me.

01:24:45.766 --> 01:24:47.370
And your friend?

01:24:48.686 --> 01:24:50.097
Pope!

01:24:50.286 --> 01:24:52.175
Hello guys!

01:24:53.526 --> 01:24:55.733
- I missed you!
- Are you coming home?

01:24:55.926 --> 01:24:57.815
I still do not know, honey.

01:24:59.086 --> 01:25:01.692
At the kindergarten I made
a drawing by Rudolph.

01:25:01.886 --> 01:25:03.775
- Really '?
- Dad, guess!

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:07.687
At school there's a guy named Bernard
and it bothers me every day.

01:25:07.886 --> 01:25:09.934
- So I got it...
- Guys!

01:25:10.126 --> 01:25:11.810
Neil, sorry.

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.775
Daddy and we have to talk,
can you take Holly upstairs?

01:25:17.606 --> 01:25:19.813
Tell me later.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.974
So, your friend?

01:25:39.365 --> 01:25:40.855
It's over.

01:25:41.405 --> 01:25:44.807
The truth is that there has
never been anything serious.

01:25:46.965 --> 01:25:49.127
And you expect me to believe you?

01:25:49.325 --> 01:25:51.134
It is the truth.

01:25:51.325 --> 01:25:54.135
I've never loved
anyone except you.

01:25:55.125 --> 01:25:56.934
And I'm sorry...

01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:58.570
NO!

01:26:04.685 --> 01:26:07.575
Do you really think it's that easy?

01:26:07.765 --> 01:26:10.609
No, I did something
incredibly stupid

01:26:10.804 --> 01:26:13.205
and I'm sorry. I do not know what...

01:26:13.404 --> 01:26:15.293
You're a bastard!

01:26:26.164 --> 01:26:28.053
Forgive me!

01:26:28.444 --> 01:26:30.014
Please.

01:26:30.844 --> 01:26:32.733
Julie, do not hate me.

01:26:40.004 --> 01:26:42.006
Please forgive me.

01:27:46.682 --> 01:27:48.366
I love you.

01:27:48.602 --> 01:27:50.445
I'm really sorry.

01:27:50.762 --> 01:27:53.208
I did not mean to hurt you.

01:27:54.482 --> 01:27:56.484
I want to forgive me.

01:27:59.282 --> 01:28:00.932
I love you.

01:28:03.242 --> 01:28:04.892
I love you too.

01:28:06.962 --> 01:28:09.169
We have many things to fix.

01:28:10.682 --> 01:28:12.684
Are you willing to try '?

01:28:14.402 --> 01:28:15.927
Yup.

01:28:17.602 --> 01:28:21.004
So I'm going to get
my things, all right?

01:28:24.481 --> 01:28:26.483
I will forgive myself,

01:28:26.961 --> 01:28:28.770
I promise you.

01:28:56.761 --> 01:28:59.765
- Hello!
- Dad, come back to live here?

01:28:59.961 --> 01:29:01.963
That's right!

01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:05.765
I'm going to get my clothes and
then I'll be back forever.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.361
- Can I come?
- What do you say?

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.561
- Then I come too.
- All right.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.042
- Both.
- Hurry up.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.322
- Hello Mom.
- Hi, honey.

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:38.648
My God!

01:30:45.318 --> 01:30:46.968
Rita!

01:31:31.637 --> 01:31:33.844
You did not have to get it back.

01:31:36.477 --> 01:31:38.081
He does not deserve it.

01:31:43.677 --> 01:31:46.487
It was I who prevented
Holly from drowning.

01:31:46.917 --> 01:31:48.521
Did you know that '?

01:31:51.557 --> 01:31:54.606
I was the one who taught
Neil to defend himself.

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:58.279
You did not have to lie to me!

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:04.325
I do not understand.

01:32:04.516 --> 01:32:06.518
When did I lie to you?

01:32:07.996 --> 01:32:10.727
You invited me to you.

01:32:11.196 --> 01:32:14.837
Do you remember? You invited me and
then you slammed the door in my face!

01:32:18.476 --> 01:32:20.080
Come here u

01:32:20.276 --> 01:32:21.687
leave me

01:32:21.876 --> 01:32:23.640
come here.

01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:27.443
I protected you. He was going
with another, did you know him?

01:32:28.916 --> 01:32:31.123
Leave me immediately!

01:32:34.356 --> 01:32:36.085
Iasciami.

01:32:45.156 --> 01:32:47.762
- Julie...
- You're right, Tom.

01:32:47.955 --> 01:32:50.356
I did not have to let him come back.

01:32:52.115 --> 01:32:55.324
You did not have to '?
So why did you do it?

01:32:58.875 --> 01:33:01.446
Children need their father.

01:33:01.635 --> 01:33:04.445
I could be the father!

01:33:06.635 --> 01:33:08.956
Of course, you could be you.

01:33:10.235 --> 01:33:12.556
I could be the father.

01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:15.964
But Tom, you never
told me anything.

01:33:16.755 --> 01:33:18.325
You...

01:33:18.515 --> 01:33:20.756
I did not know you saved Holly

01:33:20.955 --> 01:33:25.199
and you never told me how you
feel about Holly and Neil.

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.522
I did not know your intentions.

01:33:31.634 --> 01:33:33.523
I did not know.

01:33:36.794 --> 01:33:38.523
Now you know.

01:33:38.914 --> 01:33:40.484
True??

01:33:41.794 --> 01:33:44.035
I did not know I could choose.

01:33:44.394 --> 01:33:46.795
If I had known I could choose,

01:33:46.994 --> 01:33:49.122
I would not let him come back.

01:33:51.394 --> 01:33:53.283
But I did not know it.

01:33:55.314 --> 01:33:57.760
Do you understand me '? I did not know.

01:33:58.194 --> 01:33:59.684
Yup.

01:33:59.874 --> 01:34:02.002
- Now you understand '?
- Yup.

01:34:02.874 --> 01:34:04.876
Yes I understand.

01:34:11.554 --> 01:34:14.285
Tom, why do not we go downstairs?

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:18.442
Let's go downstairs and then
when Phil will arrive...

01:34:19.713 --> 01:34:22.717
we will tell him that
he no longer needs him.

01:34:23.433 --> 01:34:25.242
We'll tell her.

01:34:26.033 --> 01:34:27.364
Good.

01:34:27.553 --> 01:34:29.874
- Let's do like this '?
- All right.

01:34:50.313 --> 01:34:52.042
Sit here.

01:34:56.153 --> 01:34:57.757
Here it is.

01:34:59.032 --> 01:35:01.239
- It's better here, no?
- Yeah.

01:35:05.112 --> 01:35:07.922
I prepare something to drink '?
What do you say?

01:35:08.112 --> 01:35:11.195
- That would be nice.
- Yes, all right.
