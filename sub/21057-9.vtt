00:36.340 --> 00:42.049
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.149 --> 00:43.479
Get rid of them one by one.

00:44.049 --> 00:47.420
You can start with that childish wench over there.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.520
Get out.

00:48.619 --> 00:50.990
Your son can't eat at the table and your daughter is getting kicked out!

00:51.090 --> 00:52.590
Let him come back home for the time being.

00:52.659 --> 00:54.560
He's the one who put me in this misery.

00:54.630 --> 00:58.530
So, you're saying Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn aren't on good terms?

00:58.630 --> 01:00.100
They treat each other like strangers.

01:00.170 --> 01:02.869
You treat me like an insect!

01:02.969 --> 01:04.140
You scum!

01:04.200 --> 01:06.400
If you spew that kind of nonsense once more,

01:06.909 --> 01:10.040
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

01:10.140 --> 01:11.540
He's not my child, but my enemy.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.780
That's why we should give birth to a good kid who won't be our enemy.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.049
I'm going to have a child.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.250
If you see my husband once again,

01:21.390 --> 01:23.819
you'll get a lot more than just harsh words.

01:24.060 --> 01:26.090
I'll make sure that you won't even able to say...

01:26.459 --> 01:29.329
that I'm out of line. Do you get that?

01:29.829 --> 01:32.430
I always do what I say I'll do.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.700
Don't we love each other?

01:34.799 --> 01:37.400
Our love hasn't ended yet.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.140
(Caregiver)

01:42.709 --> 01:44.379
- Hello? - A Jin?

01:44.879 --> 01:46.540
I'm sorry for calling you so early.

01:47.209 --> 01:50.549
Can you come by with Jae Seok before he goes to work?

01:51.349 --> 01:52.719
Okay, I will.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.099
Ahn Jae Seok!

02:38.159 --> 02:39.300
Stop right there!

02:45.770 --> 02:48.469
I told you to stop! Stop!

03:09.090 --> 03:10.199
Did you sleep well?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.270
What's wrong?

03:15.330 --> 03:16.840
What do you mean?

03:17.340 --> 03:18.699
You look sad.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.370
It's nothing.

03:20.509 --> 03:22.610
You should eat breakfast and go to school, my princess.

03:22.710 --> 03:23.939
Go and wash your face.

03:24.110 --> 03:25.139
What about Dad?

03:25.139 --> 03:26.610
Did he go for a morning exercise?

03:28.210 --> 03:29.280
Yes.

03:29.550 --> 03:33.219
You know that Dad always does his best.

03:33.919 --> 03:35.719
Mom, I'd like some toast for breakfast.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.020
Sure!

03:43.830 --> 03:45.030
I'm here.

03:46.659 --> 03:47.669
A Jin?

03:49.669 --> 03:51.969
- You're here. - What's wrong?

03:56.569 --> 03:58.780
Is your husband out cycling again?

04:10.090 --> 04:12.289
Ms. Park wants you to come downstairs.

04:12.590 --> 04:14.860
- Go away. - You should go.

04:15.259 --> 04:17.199
- Why don't you go away? - She called...

04:17.300 --> 04:19.730
Who are you taking orders from?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.870
I did my part.

04:30.110 --> 04:33.649
Mr. Oh, please take care of Chairman Ahn.

04:33.949 --> 04:35.310
You know that he has a doctor's appointment...

04:35.310 --> 04:37.079
after physical therapy, right?

04:37.750 --> 04:39.050
I'm not a child, you know.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.949
- See you. - Goodbye.

04:48.490 --> 04:50.459
Let's go somewhere this afternoon.

04:51.230 --> 04:53.230
- Where? - You'll see.

04:53.670 --> 04:54.670
Okay.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.740
You should let your kids say goodbye.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.120
- You're here. - Good morning.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.060
Chairman Ahn is going out.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.529
Let's talk after we say goodbye.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.410
- Have a good trip, Father. - Bye, Father.

05:42.110 --> 05:44.519
I already called Dr. Choi,

05:44.519 --> 05:46.120
but since Chairman Ahn's blood sugar levels are low,

05:46.220 --> 05:49.089
ask Dr. Choi whether he should continue taking his medicine.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.220
Okay, ma'am.

05:50.959 --> 05:51.959
Honey.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.790
Have a safe trip.

05:55.029 --> 05:56.699
Okay. Go on.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.199
You all didn't need to come and see me off.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.170
Well, they should from now on.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.000
Although, I can't tell whether they just plainly don't know...

06:04.399 --> 06:07.069
or just simply decided not to pay you the respect.

06:33.230 --> 06:34.269
Have a drink.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.339
You speak a dialect...

06:37.800 --> 06:39.899
in front of my father,

06:40.170 --> 06:41.839
but you speak standard language in front of us.

06:42.310 --> 06:43.410
Are you bipolar?

06:43.910 --> 06:44.980
How is that possible?

06:45.209 --> 06:48.509
Have this small snack before breakfast.

06:48.850 --> 06:50.850
How are we supposed to eat this greasy stuff in the morning?

06:51.050 --> 06:52.949
Pork and potato pancakes.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.490
This is persimmon leaves tea.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.220
Both are for Chairman Ahn.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.490
They are good for diabetes.

07:00.829 --> 07:04.360
Do you have any interest in what Chairman Ahn eats...

07:04.459 --> 07:06.800
and how well he is recovering?

07:11.069 --> 07:14.709
I don't care about anything...

07:14.769 --> 07:16.610
except for Mr. Chairman's well-being.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.350
I shouldn't be the only one who cares.

07:23.449 --> 07:26.079
Don't you all want Chairman Ahn to become healthy?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.589
What's your point?

07:27.689 --> 07:30.319
The chairman owns this house...

07:31.019 --> 07:34.389
and I am his rightful wife.

07:34.990 --> 07:37.230
- You. - Watch your language!

07:37.860 --> 07:39.560
How dare you call me like that?

07:41.399 --> 07:44.899
If you can't call me "Mother," don't even think about starting with me.

07:46.769 --> 07:47.970
Ms. Cheon?

07:48.139 --> 07:49.310
Yes, madam.

07:50.639 --> 07:52.779
Why isn't Jae Gu here?

07:53.009 --> 07:56.250
I told him, but he told me to go away.

07:56.850 --> 07:58.720
If he leaves the house, empty his room.

07:59.449 --> 08:01.019
We'll use his room as a guest room.

08:01.519 --> 08:02.519
Okay.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.120
What does that mean?

08:05.660 --> 08:07.329
Are you going to kick out my brother?

08:07.430 --> 08:12.129
Anything that badly influences the health of Chairman Ahn...

08:12.199 --> 08:14.129
will be nipped in the bud.

08:14.769 --> 08:17.639
I will be stricter with his children.

08:18.269 --> 08:19.269
Unbelievable.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.410
Why are you doing this?

08:21.509 --> 08:23.879
To protect Chairman Ahn.

08:24.079 --> 08:26.209
How touching.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.550
Did you discuss this with my father?

08:29.079 --> 08:30.379
Or is this entirely your decision?

08:31.920 --> 08:33.750
This is entirely my decision...

08:34.389 --> 08:36.450
and I plan to tell him this evening.

08:36.549 --> 08:37.860
Who are you to make such a decision?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.120
You, get out right now.

08:39.490 --> 08:43.558
This part was decided by your father.

08:43.830 --> 08:44.899
Go home.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.629
There's no space for you here.

08:47.330 --> 08:50.039
Who are you to talk down to me?

08:50.039 --> 08:51.139
Ahn Jae Hui.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.809
You have no respect,

08:55.309 --> 08:57.710
no common sense, and no manners.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.840
Who taught you to behave like that?

09:00.009 --> 09:01.809
I am lawfully your mother.

09:02.049 --> 09:06.450
I don't want to call such a stupid person like you my daughter.

09:07.049 --> 09:09.519
However, I have been merciful...

09:09.590 --> 09:12.120
since you are the daughter of Chairman Ahn.

09:12.789 --> 09:13.960
Leave, now.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.090
I will never leave this house.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.129
Leave!

09:17.360 --> 09:19.659
I won't!

09:20.029 --> 09:21.669
This is my house. Why do I need to leave?

09:21.669 --> 09:23.000
I will never leave!

09:23.000 --> 09:25.840
This is not your house! This is your father's house!

09:26.710 --> 09:30.009
If you don't want to be dragged out, leave on your own.

09:30.009 --> 09:31.179
I told you...

09:32.409 --> 09:33.779
what I will do with the room.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.620
Where do you expect me to go?

09:40.049 --> 09:42.820
Get a single room or a dormitory,

09:42.820 --> 09:44.159
it's not my problem.

09:45.059 --> 09:46.090
Wait.

09:46.659 --> 09:48.830
I think I heard enough...

09:48.830 --> 09:51.029
to understand what you are trying to say.

09:51.159 --> 09:53.830
I need to leave now, but I want to continue this discussion.

09:53.929 --> 09:55.200
Excuse me.

10:27.429 --> 10:30.340
Do you need to go home?

10:33.740 --> 10:34.970
I will come every day from now on.

10:35.470 --> 10:38.340
Can't you just...

10:38.840 --> 10:40.350
stay here with me?

10:41.549 --> 10:42.679
Can't you?

10:44.019 --> 10:45.179
I can't yet.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.220
I need more time.

10:50.259 --> 10:51.320
Do you...

10:52.090 --> 10:53.120
love me?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.159
Yes.

11:00.299 --> 11:01.470
I think so.

11:09.309 --> 11:11.740
Life is a collection of ironies.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.779
Open up your eyes.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.419
A woman who has a plastic surgeon as her husband,

11:21.820 --> 11:25.789
secretly has plastic surgery...

11:25.889 --> 11:27.730
from another surgeon.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.429
I will begin the anesthesia.

11:32.929 --> 11:36.799
One who uses physical force to get what he wants,

11:36.870 --> 11:39.000
loses it by physical force.

11:41.139 --> 11:43.809
A man who once made a woman angry by his laziness,

11:45.480 --> 11:49.909
once again made her angry by his overdue diligence.

11:54.950 --> 11:55.990
A Jin.

11:56.690 --> 11:57.759
I don't think...

12:00.330 --> 12:01.730
I can break up with her.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.500
Sorry.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.370
That doesn't mean that I don't love you.

12:10.669 --> 12:13.669
What can I do to something that has already happened?

12:17.210 --> 12:18.340
You scum.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.149
Until...

12:21.480 --> 12:23.480
I have made a decision,

12:25.220 --> 12:26.889
don't say a word.

12:34.659 --> 12:35.690
She is really angry.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.000
She hit me hard.

12:52.179 --> 12:54.480
It must weigh more than 200kg.

12:54.710 --> 12:57.720
You still have it in you.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.580
I was lucky.

13:00.090 --> 13:01.690
We took care of this area today.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.250
We should hunt the other side tomorrow.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.590
Okay.

13:05.259 --> 13:08.789
We should go back to town and have soju with that.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.330
Good idea.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.740
Ms. Cheon.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.679
Why?

13:31.580 --> 13:34.919
About A Jin...

13:34.919 --> 13:35.950
Yes?

13:36.889 --> 13:38.690
I think she has a problem.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.460
Yes, she looked concerned.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.330
Find out what it is.

13:42.429 --> 13:43.799
I will after I finish this.

13:44.330 --> 13:45.629
I need to go somewhere,

13:45.899 --> 13:48.129
so clean up the room downstairs when the workers arrive.

13:48.299 --> 13:50.639
Yes, madam. Have a good trip.

14:13.090 --> 14:14.159
Thank you.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.110
Hey. Mister!

14:27.669 --> 14:29.509
Empty this room by 4pm.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.909
Thank you.

14:35.049 --> 14:36.110
Do you want food?

14:37.019 --> 14:38.750
I have nowhere else to go.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.320
I heard that there's an empty room at Ms. Woo's home.

14:44.519 --> 14:45.860
Do you want me to come with you?

14:46.259 --> 14:48.590
You might feel awkward to go alone.

14:49.029 --> 14:50.629
- Will you? - I will.

14:50.730 --> 14:51.960
You should speak with more respect.

14:52.129 --> 14:54.629
Gosh. Such a thing is not important.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.110
Why do I deserve this treatment?

15:00.169 --> 15:01.440
Why!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.110
A Jin!

15:10.220 --> 15:11.419
What brings you here?

15:11.519 --> 15:13.690
I need to stay here...

15:14.250 --> 15:16.889
in the empty guest room.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.059
How can you come here after leaving that house?

15:20.129 --> 15:21.429
Where do I go then?

15:22.629 --> 15:23.929
Do whatever you please.

15:26.629 --> 15:29.230
Are you looking down on me too?

15:29.830 --> 15:30.940
Really?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Why did you come here?

15:33.639 --> 15:36.679
Ms. Ahn felt awkward to come here alone, so I came with her.

15:36.809 --> 15:38.639
Take her back to where she came from.

15:39.009 --> 15:41.379
We already have a lot going on here.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.649
Why is that?

15:43.049 --> 15:44.480
Is there a problem?

15:44.549 --> 15:46.720
Ms. Woo seems concerned.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.120
Enough.

15:48.850 --> 15:52.019
You should not poke your nose into other people's matters.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.059
Is her husband cheating on her?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.590
My gosh.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.559
Are Jae Seok and A Jin using separate rooms?

16:16.580 --> 16:17.980
Do you want tea?

16:19.149 --> 16:21.820
I don't think we are close enough for that.

16:22.220 --> 16:25.919
Do you want a glass of water so you can throw it on my face?

16:30.129 --> 16:31.830
I am an artist.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.669
I have an open mind...

16:35.070 --> 16:37.000
that normal people like you do not understand.

16:37.470 --> 16:41.269
I haven't felt so certain in my life.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.940
I love that man.

16:45.779 --> 16:47.779
An open mind?

16:49.179 --> 16:50.580
Felt so certain, you say?

16:54.549 --> 16:55.820
You must be joking.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.389
I really don't understand.

17:00.629 --> 17:02.059
What is your plan?

17:02.659 --> 17:04.230
I will follow his plans.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.339
You must be out of your mind.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.940
Yes, I am.

17:12.470 --> 17:15.470
How else could I be seeing a married man with a child?

17:15.539 --> 17:18.240
Do you want me to divorce him?

17:19.339 --> 17:20.680
To be honest,

17:21.108 --> 17:22.410
I do.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.779
I hate being so secretive...

17:25.920 --> 17:27.049
in our relationship.

17:28.619 --> 17:31.619
But he doesn't want that.

17:32.789 --> 17:35.289
Then, what does he want?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.130
He is a responsible man.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.029
So, he is having a hard time.

17:41.329 --> 17:44.539
That's why I want a fair play, madam.

17:46.170 --> 17:48.539
We should wait until...

17:49.069 --> 17:50.509
he makes a decision.

17:53.349 --> 17:54.450
Your wish...

17:54.980 --> 17:57.650
is to be his mistress, is it?

17:58.319 --> 18:02.920
Who on earth taught you that this is normal?

18:04.160 --> 18:06.490
Is this how an artist thinks?

18:06.559 --> 18:08.390
I will accept all criticisms.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.759
When I received your call, I told myself to be prepared...

18:13.259 --> 18:14.869
to accept any punishment,

18:14.930 --> 18:16.200
even if it means getting hit...

18:17.539 --> 18:18.799
or being splashed with water.

18:22.839 --> 18:25.339
Okay, then.

18:25.710 --> 18:27.410
You can have him.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.880
I can't accept the idea of this "fair play" nonsense.

18:31.019 --> 18:32.480
I will not do such a thing.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.019
But I have a problem.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.220
He and I have a daughter.

18:37.690 --> 18:40.490
She's the reason that's keeping me...

18:40.559 --> 18:43.400
from destroying the both of you.

18:47.269 --> 18:50.099
I need to protect my daughter.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.240
I need to keep...

18:55.170 --> 18:56.680
her father safe.

18:59.710 --> 19:03.779
Don't you know how devastating it is for a child to lose...

19:04.880 --> 19:05.880
her own father?

19:14.930 --> 19:16.190
Artist Yun Seong Hui.

19:19.059 --> 19:20.269
I beg you.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.400
Please don't take away her father...

19:26.099 --> 19:27.670
from Ji Hu.

19:28.039 --> 19:29.109
Please.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.440
My husband.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.180
Just secretly love him...

19:34.880 --> 19:36.609
and let him go.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.019
Don't make him fall into this any deeper.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.420
I want it to go back to normal.

19:46.490 --> 19:47.559
I will pretend...

19:49.259 --> 19:51.099
that this never happened.

19:52.960 --> 19:53.970
Please.

19:55.829 --> 19:56.970
I beg you.

19:58.569 --> 20:01.670
I have nothing more to say. Sorry.

20:01.839 --> 20:02.940
Please leave.

20:15.990 --> 20:18.319
Is this the shrine...

20:18.390 --> 20:21.460
where you do memorial service...

20:21.690 --> 20:24.829
for your brother...

20:25.329 --> 20:26.700
and your late wife?

20:26.730 --> 20:27.730
Yes.

20:28.130 --> 20:31.640
I thought you should come.

20:33.539 --> 20:37.180
I will go and have a talk with the monk here.

20:37.380 --> 20:40.079
You should stay inside the car.

20:40.180 --> 20:41.210
Okay.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.470
Yes.

21:00.599 --> 21:02.170
Please lose some weight.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.640
- You're skinny as a rail. - Partner. How are you doing?

21:06.170 --> 21:09.470
I am leading the next mind teaching session.

21:09.970 --> 21:13.779
So, I was wondering if you have any good topics in mind.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.650
Is that so?

21:17.880 --> 21:20.390
A good topic? Let's see...

21:23.420 --> 21:24.589
Is there something wrong?

21:25.390 --> 21:29.089
No. I will think of a good topic.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.930
I will call you when I do.

21:32.599 --> 21:33.630
Partner.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.230
Where are you now?

21:36.099 --> 21:37.269
I will go there.

21:38.299 --> 21:40.740
No. I'm fine.

21:40.809 --> 21:42.009
There must be something wrong...

21:42.609 --> 21:44.279
Dealing with the grim reaper...

21:44.339 --> 21:45.940
I have already dealt with him.

21:46.009 --> 21:49.680
Last month, by the way, you...

21:50.549 --> 21:52.720
Even your ear is too fat that you can't hear well, can you?

21:52.819 --> 21:54.390
- Whatever. - Mr. Kang.

22:01.730 --> 22:03.630
I'm the first lady of the house.

22:04.130 --> 22:07.130
But I'm not sure of what I'm doing.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.470
The monk said...

22:09.700 --> 22:12.140
he needs Ms. Woo for the discussion.

22:15.210 --> 22:19.680
Every matter of the house needs her approval,

22:20.650 --> 22:23.650
so I am like a puppet with no power.

22:50.140 --> 22:53.380
- You're here. - Yes. The two are in the room.

22:55.309 --> 22:56.309
The two?

22:58.019 --> 23:00.019
Do you mean those two scums?

23:01.319 --> 23:03.490
I am going to destroy the both of them today.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.690
Lead the way.

23:18.069 --> 23:19.900
This is your first time here, right?

23:27.009 --> 23:28.049
Hello?

23:28.049 --> 23:31.720
Your husband is seeing another woman.

23:32.279 --> 23:34.519
Hey, don't hang up. Hello?

23:44.630 --> 23:47.430
The number you have dialed cannot be reached.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.680
I checked your number,

23:56.680 --> 23:59.240
so pick up the phone or else I will call the police.

24:14.529 --> 24:15.589
Hello?

24:15.730 --> 24:17.559
Don't hang up and listen to me.

24:18.130 --> 24:21.500
You told me that my husband is seeing another woman...

24:21.500 --> 24:22.869
by texting me and calling me, right?

24:22.970 --> 24:23.970
Yes.

24:24.700 --> 24:28.210
Let's meet right now or else I'll call the police.

24:30.579 --> 24:31.579
It's me.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.579
Unlock the door.

24:47.390 --> 24:48.460
Honey?

24:50.259 --> 24:52.329
What are you doing?

24:52.329 --> 24:54.170
What are you two doing here?

24:55.069 --> 24:56.329
Who is this thing?

24:57.240 --> 24:59.299
We were working on marketing for blogs.

25:00.069 --> 25:01.140
Are you her husband?

25:02.210 --> 25:04.039
Yes. I'm sorry for the interruption.

25:04.980 --> 25:08.809
Next time, I'll go to your office for discussion.

25:09.910 --> 25:13.849
I think my husband is mistaken.

25:14.190 --> 25:16.450
Gosh. You shouldn't have mistaken.

25:17.089 --> 25:19.019
Especially, in this business residence.

25:19.519 --> 25:20.759
I don't know what to say.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.640
Is that true?

25:38.180 --> 25:39.240
Yes.

25:40.049 --> 25:41.150
What do you want?

25:41.609 --> 25:42.779
I don't need anything.

25:44.519 --> 25:46.549
I just need to pick a side.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.619
You've made the right choice. Take this.

25:55.230 --> 25:56.230
Thank you.

25:56.390 --> 25:58.599
I'll leave now.

26:01.829 --> 26:02.869
Wait.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.109
There has to be a reason.

26:11.210 --> 26:13.039
Even though I have nothing,

26:13.140 --> 26:15.509
I still have my dignity and I do feel anger.

26:16.819 --> 26:18.819
He humiliated me.

26:19.519 --> 26:22.190
Even if I become his slave,

26:23.019 --> 26:24.660
I will be used and abandoned.

26:24.819 --> 26:27.630
But I don't think you will.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.029
That's it.

26:32.630 --> 26:34.730
The divine gives the power to survive...

26:35.130 --> 26:37.799
in given circumstances...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.769
to those who have nothing.

26:41.269 --> 26:45.339
Not to say that the divine is fair.

26:47.609 --> 26:49.349
They have been using separate rooms.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.220
I think her husband is cheating on her.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.819
I'm sure of it.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.450
I myself had someone cheat on me.

26:56.650 --> 26:58.460
I am an expert in this field.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.759
Okay, then.

27:01.529 --> 27:02.559
You can go now.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.660
Yes, madam.

27:23.980 --> 27:25.349
Nurse Jeong?

27:30.690 --> 27:33.190
Yes, madam. I did it.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.730
You weren't joking around, were you?

27:36.730 --> 27:37.799
No.

27:38.230 --> 27:39.930
It didn't seem like it.

27:40.769 --> 27:42.769
Why did you do this instead of telling me directly?

27:43.069 --> 27:44.099
Because...

27:44.440 --> 27:46.170
I didn't want to meddle in other people's affairs.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.039
My father...

27:50.279 --> 27:53.480
cheated on my mother, so she had a hard time.

27:53.950 --> 27:55.910
Everyone knew about it except you...

27:56.180 --> 27:59.049
and no one tried to tell you.

27:59.519 --> 28:00.920
I'm sorry, madam.

28:02.950 --> 28:03.960
Don't be.

28:04.690 --> 28:06.059
Thank you.

28:08.390 --> 28:09.390
Then...

28:10.299 --> 28:12.660
Do you know who the woman is?

28:12.730 --> 28:14.900
I'm not sure...

28:15.700 --> 28:16.869
How did you find out?

28:16.970 --> 28:19.640
I overheard what people were saying...

28:21.910 --> 28:24.940
and I saw her face.

28:26.309 --> 28:28.380
- You saw her face? - Yes.

28:28.450 --> 28:29.579
Who on earth was it?

28:29.710 --> 28:30.880
She was a patient.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.880
She came to our hospital,

28:33.319 --> 28:34.990
but I don't know her name.

28:36.119 --> 28:39.119
But I can find out.

28:39.490 --> 28:42.289
- How? - We have pictures of our patients.

28:43.130 --> 28:44.299
Before and after the surgery.

28:45.359 --> 28:46.700
We have hers too.

29:19.829 --> 29:21.930
How long have they been using separate rooms?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.140
This is a matter that concerns my son.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.369
Speak up.

29:30.039 --> 29:32.809
I'm not really sure.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.279
How long has it been since he cheated on her?

29:47.490 --> 29:49.329
Do you want to get fired?

29:51.059 --> 29:52.099
Speak up.

30:01.410 --> 30:02.940
(Caregiver)

30:08.809 --> 30:10.150
(Message received)

30:18.859 --> 30:19.960
Where are you?

30:36.069 --> 30:39.440
If I start over, I want to become an artist.

30:40.349 --> 30:41.779
You should start now.

30:42.609 --> 30:43.750
I am thinking about it.

30:44.579 --> 30:47.589
That painting was probably painted...

30:47.920 --> 30:49.619
after it was sketched.

30:54.660 --> 30:56.529
There are stages in every matter.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.700
I will let Jae Hui stay in my house.

31:01.730 --> 31:04.740
That is not what I want.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.109
We need discipline in this house.

31:07.470 --> 31:10.839
Rome wasn't built in a day. It takes time.

31:11.579 --> 31:14.250
Yes, it takes time.

31:14.779 --> 31:18.049
But sometimes,

31:18.480 --> 31:21.420
things should be rushed.

31:25.789 --> 31:28.190
We need to go somewhere.

31:46.210 --> 31:48.049
I heard that she is an artist.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.420
Let's go there.

31:53.049 --> 31:55.549
I don't know how you found out,

31:56.859 --> 31:58.789
but I'd rather you mind your own business.

31:59.589 --> 32:01.089
I'd like you to pretend you didn't know.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.089
What are you going to do if Chairman Ahn finds out?

32:03.660 --> 32:06.130
Do you expect Chairman Ahn to trust your husband...

32:06.200 --> 32:08.730
in running his business when he is distracted by such matters?

32:11.569 --> 32:13.710
You say that this is not my business?

32:14.369 --> 32:17.240
This is a matter that also concerns me.

32:18.609 --> 32:20.349
Because he is my son.

32:22.579 --> 32:23.619
Let's go.

32:24.049 --> 32:25.049
There's no need.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.250
A Jin.

32:34.190 --> 32:35.759
I will get my hands dirty for you.

32:36.759 --> 32:40.569
I'll do what you can't, A Jin.

32:45.839 --> 32:46.839
Let's go.

33:04.420 --> 33:06.619
Partner, are you all right?

33:10.230 --> 33:12.559
Attorney Kang Gi Ho. The trial is about to begin.

33:12.630 --> 33:13.769
Okay.

33:22.309 --> 33:23.480
It's Room 306.

33:49.430 --> 33:50.500
Oh my.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.710
Hey!

33:54.069 --> 33:55.839
Who are you?

33:55.940 --> 33:57.109
That's not your business.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.380
Get out before I call the police!

34:00.480 --> 34:01.549
Who are you?

34:05.049 --> 34:07.190
Did you have an affair with Jae Seok?

34:07.849 --> 34:09.150
Who...

34:09.320 --> 34:10.320
You're the one, right?

34:11.559 --> 34:12.719
You crazy girl!

34:12.960 --> 34:16.090
How dare you mess around with someone...

34:16.190 --> 34:18.230
who has a daughter and a wife?

34:20.130 --> 34:21.869
Where do you think you're going?

34:23.768 --> 34:25.170
You!

34:28.440 --> 34:29.710
Come here!

34:31.280 --> 34:33.179
Do you want to die?

34:36.050 --> 34:37.480
How dare you?

34:37.750 --> 34:39.679
Where are you running off to?

34:40.320 --> 34:41.349
Stay still!

34:47.989 --> 34:51.000
If you don't want your face butchered,

34:51.659 --> 34:54.329
stop messing around with him.

34:55.070 --> 34:56.630
End it immediately!

34:57.800 --> 34:59.139
I'll be watching.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.840
My painting.

35:41.309 --> 35:42.550
My painting.

36:44.179 --> 36:45.239
Hello?

36:47.909 --> 36:48.909
Me too.

36:50.519 --> 36:51.719
I love you.

36:53.550 --> 36:54.590
Let's not...

36:55.250 --> 36:57.789
worry about the future.

37:00.730 --> 37:02.030
I'll see you in the evening.

37:04.059 --> 37:05.199
I miss you.

37:05.429 --> 37:06.969
How much time will a person serve...

37:07.730 --> 37:09.300
if one is charged with soliciting an assault?

37:09.400 --> 37:12.900
Assault can be settled between two parties.

37:13.239 --> 37:14.440
I will not settle.

37:14.769 --> 37:16.780
Do you know who it is?

37:16.940 --> 37:18.010
Of course.

37:23.519 --> 37:25.349
Please find the criminal.

37:26.380 --> 37:29.090
I'm going home. Yun Jae will be home soon.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.800
Your room is empty.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.639
The newcomer emptied your room.

37:49.170 --> 37:51.280
You probably need to leave.

37:51.809 --> 37:53.980
What a joke.

37:55.010 --> 37:56.380
I know, right?

37:56.880 --> 37:59.219
What a joke.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.300
Hey. How can you take that?

38:26.639 --> 38:28.449
- Hello? - Darling.

38:28.510 --> 38:29.880
I've been hit.

38:30.250 --> 38:31.250
What?

38:31.679 --> 38:33.550
I don't know who it was.

38:33.650 --> 38:35.550
She came here uninvited,

38:35.650 --> 38:38.019
hit me, poured water, and swore at me.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.429
I am scared.

38:43.289 --> 38:45.900
Don't come. Absolutely.

38:46.030 --> 38:48.400
She must be around here.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.500
Please don't come.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.769
She might even be overhearing this conversation.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.539
I don't know who it was.

39:01.449 --> 39:03.550
She wasn't an old woman.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.219
I don't know.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.530
Enjoy.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.760
Let's see.

39:38.679 --> 39:41.719
- Ji Hu. - You're here, Dad.

39:42.519 --> 39:44.019
How was your day?

39:44.420 --> 39:45.460
Give me a kiss.

39:45.889 --> 39:46.889
Did you do your homework?

39:47.389 --> 39:49.230
- No. - Do it now.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.530
Jae Hui, why are you here?

39:54.969 --> 39:56.400
I am staying here from now on.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.070
What? Who are you to do so?

39:58.400 --> 40:00.840
I'm the bringer of peace.

40:00.909 --> 40:02.610
I've heard that you two are using separate rooms.

40:02.869 --> 40:05.940
I moved all your stuff to the main bedroom. Go on.

40:18.659 --> 40:20.130
(Certified Copy of Property Registration)

40:20.190 --> 40:24.000
We'll move here and start over.

40:27.369 --> 40:29.400
Why is my sister here?

40:29.730 --> 40:31.599
She's your sister. Ask her yourself.

40:32.039 --> 40:34.940
A Jin. I am not going to divorce you.

40:35.769 --> 40:36.940
Shut your mouth.

40:37.010 --> 40:39.510
I just want coexistence.

40:39.739 --> 40:42.409
- If you would let me... - Get out!

40:42.949 --> 40:44.280
Go out and die!

40:44.449 --> 40:46.789
A Jin. I am tired.

40:47.190 --> 40:49.019
I have nowhere else to go.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.489
Someone broke into Seong Hui's house and hit her.

40:51.989 --> 40:53.090
Do you know who it was?

40:53.960 --> 40:55.289
Did you order it?

40:58.059 --> 40:59.900
You ordered it, right?

41:00.300 --> 41:01.670
Was it your mother?

41:02.530 --> 41:04.539
She told me it wasn't an old woman.

41:05.570 --> 41:08.070
Did she get Botox?

41:15.750 --> 41:17.079
Are you sleeping?

41:23.019 --> 41:25.019
Fine.

41:26.260 --> 41:29.090
I'll talk to A Jin tomorrow.

41:29.929 --> 41:32.329
I'll give you the bank account...

41:32.630 --> 41:34.170
that receives the rent from the factory...

41:35.130 --> 41:39.199
and you can take care of the memorial services in the shrine.

41:42.010 --> 41:45.079
From now on, you take care of all the family affairs.

41:46.710 --> 41:47.750
Good enough?

41:55.590 --> 41:58.760
All of this is for your own good.

42:06.559 --> 42:07.969
Come out!

42:15.469 --> 42:17.380
The chairman is sleeping. What are you doing?

42:19.179 --> 42:21.710
You brought her here, right?

42:22.510 --> 42:25.750
This woman lay down next to me...

42:26.480 --> 42:27.750
while I was asleep.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
He's mistaken.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.659
He took my blanket, so...

42:32.659 --> 42:34.630
So that's why you were going to sleep next to me?

42:34.889 --> 42:37.360
No. That wasn't it, my blanket...

42:39.860 --> 42:41.030
Do you want to get fired?

42:41.599 --> 42:43.099
What do you think you are doing?

42:54.050 --> 42:55.210
Sorry, madam.

42:55.210 --> 42:57.980
Did you want to sleep your way to the top...

42:58.420 --> 42:59.980
like she did?

43:01.050 --> 43:04.420
Didn't I tell you to watch your mouth?

43:08.059 --> 43:10.929
I've already killed someone before.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.099
First time, it's hard. The second time, not so much.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.869
Be careful.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.170
How dare you kick me out?

43:17.239 --> 43:20.710
Stay low if you don't want your head blown off.

43:22.670 --> 43:23.739
Stop dreaming.

43:23.880 --> 43:27.210
You'll never get what you're after.

43:27.550 --> 43:30.320
You should stop dreaming. Because you're done already.

43:35.090 --> 43:36.090
Shoot.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.360
Shoot me.

43:40.360 --> 43:43.329
If you don't shoot me here, you'll look ridiculous.

43:43.559 --> 43:46.360
Shoot me!

43:48.769 --> 43:49.769
You can't do this.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.300
- You can't do this. - Let go!

43:52.400 --> 43:54.170
- You can't do this. - What is going on?

44:25.840 --> 44:27.670
Call the police, now!

44:27.809 --> 44:28.809
Okay, okay.

44:30.210 --> 44:32.079
Are you serious? The police?

44:32.409 --> 44:34.949
Hello? There's someone with a gun here.

44:39.619 --> 44:41.119
What is going on here?

45:10.480 --> 45:13.320
What do you think you're doing? You had no business going in there!

45:13.420 --> 45:16.489
Your husband came into my room first...

45:16.489 --> 45:17.989
in the past.

45:18.489 --> 45:19.659
What?

45:19.920 --> 45:22.760
I thought he had something for me,

45:23.260 --> 45:24.630
but I guess I was mistaken.

45:24.630 --> 45:26.630
He really was lost.

45:26.869 --> 45:28.900
Sorry, I was mistaken.

45:29.730 --> 45:31.769
Then why do you use separate rooms?

45:32.369 --> 45:33.610
My gosh.

45:35.010 --> 45:37.039
I know who is backing you up,

45:37.880 --> 45:40.409
but if you flirt with my husband again,

45:41.409 --> 45:43.010
I'll kill you.

45:53.860 --> 45:54.860
(Incident Report)

45:56.530 --> 45:57.599
So...

45:57.829 --> 46:00.570
You're saying that your wife probably solicited the assault?

46:00.769 --> 46:01.900
Is that what you're saying?

46:02.199 --> 46:03.199
Yes.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.570
You should check her call records.

46:07.940 --> 46:10.139
I will never forgive her.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.750
Namaste.

46:27.690 --> 46:28.960
My husband...

46:30.360 --> 46:31.599
is cheating on me.

46:35.570 --> 46:36.969
Do you know who he's seeing?

46:38.840 --> 46:41.340
No. I have no idea.

46:44.539 --> 46:46.980
I am planning on going to the hospital to find out.

46:49.079 --> 46:51.219
I hate to go there.

46:52.019 --> 46:53.219
I know what it feels like.

46:54.690 --> 46:57.119
The feeling that you might have been better off not knowing.

46:59.460 --> 47:01.329
How do you know that?

47:05.329 --> 47:06.429
Did you know about this?

47:11.039 --> 47:14.170
You seemed like you knew...

47:15.110 --> 47:16.369
at the gallery bazaar.

47:16.639 --> 47:17.639
Let's...

47:18.610 --> 47:22.280
stop talking about this...

47:23.480 --> 47:25.150
and let's not talk about this to others.

47:27.050 --> 47:28.420
Of course.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.340
You must be going to the police station.

47:47.610 --> 47:48.940
Why ask if you know the answer?

47:50.010 --> 47:52.679
I guess he's your husband after all.

48:09.289 --> 48:10.460
Can we talk over the phone?

48:19.139 --> 48:20.809
Hey. Did you have breakfast?

48:21.340 --> 48:22.539
What about you, partner?

48:23.010 --> 48:24.110
What about you?

48:24.510 --> 48:27.409
- No, not yet. - In that case, I haven't either.

48:28.679 --> 48:31.079
If you haven't eaten, then I haven't.

48:31.420 --> 48:33.019
If you have eaten, then I have.

48:33.690 --> 48:34.920
Breakfast is like that.

48:37.519 --> 48:39.219
How about brunch at a fantastic place?

48:42.760 --> 48:45.500
Eat. This is real brunch.

48:45.599 --> 48:47.769
I love bean sprout soup.

48:48.199 --> 48:49.199
Me too.

48:51.670 --> 48:54.409
Did you read all my poems?

48:54.940 --> 48:56.610
Yes, quite a bit.

48:57.309 --> 49:00.510
It's quite sentimental, romantic,

49:00.809 --> 49:04.250
logical and great, isn't it?

49:04.719 --> 49:06.179
It was perfect.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.420
You look like a child when you smile.

49:12.190 --> 49:15.130
Looking like a child is not a compliment.

49:15.860 --> 49:17.059
It's not an insult either.

49:19.630 --> 49:20.670
Try and follow me.

49:26.599 --> 49:27.670
You smiled.

49:27.670 --> 49:29.670
Look how pretty you are when you smile.

49:29.969 --> 49:32.340
Don't you know that you look...

49:32.679 --> 49:35.010
exactly 4.5 times prettier than usual when you smile?

49:36.110 --> 49:39.119
Of course I know that. That's why I don't smile.

49:39.119 --> 49:40.489
Because people fall in love with me.

49:41.519 --> 49:43.690
That's quite something to be worried about!

49:44.960 --> 49:46.730
Eat. Your brunch is getting cold, partner.

50:01.170 --> 50:03.010
- Welcome. - Thank you.

50:17.559 --> 50:18.690
Who did it?

50:19.389 --> 50:21.389
That's what I was going to ask you.

50:22.130 --> 50:23.190
Oh my.

50:23.190 --> 50:24.199
Look!

50:24.360 --> 50:27.900
This is attempted murder on top of illegal possession of weapons.

50:27.969 --> 50:30.639
It was an accidental fire. It was not an attempted murder.

50:32.670 --> 50:36.340
How can I meet the head of the gallery today with this face?

50:37.210 --> 50:39.880
She was too strong.

50:40.210 --> 50:43.820
Every part of my body hurts.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.150
Should I call the police? They can find out who did it.

50:46.150 --> 50:47.190
Do you want everyone to know?

50:47.389 --> 50:49.849
We need to find out, so that we can punish the woman.

50:49.949 --> 50:52.619
Only A Jin knows about us.

50:53.289 --> 50:55.260
Manager Park also knows.

50:56.900 --> 50:59.030
Maybe it's one of your acquaintances.

50:59.230 --> 51:00.730
Do you think they have a reason to do this?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.869
They don't. She must be one of yours.

51:04.170 --> 51:05.199
Darling.

51:05.539 --> 51:07.440
Are you meeting someone else, instead of me?

51:08.239 --> 51:09.869
No way, right?

51:09.940 --> 51:12.179
What kind of a person do you think I am?

51:12.579 --> 51:14.510
There are ethics in cheating.

51:15.679 --> 51:17.119
Then who was it?

51:17.449 --> 51:19.719
- Was she pretty? - I don't know.

51:21.889 --> 51:22.949
Hey.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.989
Why don't you paint her face? You're an artist.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.530
Let's sketch her face!

51:28.360 --> 51:29.360
Excuse me.

51:29.889 --> 51:32.230
Do you have a sketchbook and a 4B pencil?

51:34.929 --> 51:37.239
How about a piece of paper...

51:37.900 --> 51:40.440
and a regular pencil?

51:44.280 --> 51:45.380
Then...

51:45.940 --> 51:49.110
How about a memo and a pen?

51:49.880 --> 51:50.920
Do you have them?

51:50.920 --> 51:52.550
Don't you know that the law has changed?

51:52.650 --> 51:54.719
It's illegal for individuals to possess air guns.

51:54.949 --> 51:56.550
It must be kept in the police station.

51:57.889 --> 51:59.719
This person was in the United States.

52:00.130 --> 52:01.659
He didn't know the law has changed.

52:01.730 --> 52:05.860
I received the notice, but I couldn't reach him.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.929
I couldn't hand it in because I didn't know where it was.

52:10.039 --> 52:14.110
The problem is that the gun was fired in a residential house.

52:14.210 --> 52:17.940
I was there. It was a mistake.

52:17.940 --> 52:19.380
No one was hurt.

52:19.380 --> 52:22.050
How can it be an attempted murder if there's no harm done?

52:22.949 --> 52:24.420
Unbelievable.

53:43.130 --> 53:44.829
Why?

54:14.360 --> 54:15.530
Sorry.

54:16.159 --> 54:18.329
Didn't I tell you to only do the things I say?

54:19.360 --> 54:20.369
You did.

54:20.699 --> 54:22.699
Then why did you do such a thing?

54:23.800 --> 54:27.539
Did I inspire you to do what you did or what?

54:29.340 --> 54:30.539
It was just...

54:31.510 --> 54:34.010
a lifelong habit of mine.

54:36.679 --> 54:37.750
Get out.

54:38.420 --> 54:39.750
Quit this job.

54:39.750 --> 54:42.150
You don't have the discipline.

54:42.150 --> 54:43.190
Cho Hui.

54:44.789 --> 54:45.989
Bok Ja.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
I mean,

54:49.260 --> 54:50.630
madam!

54:53.900 --> 54:57.599
Please. Forgive me just once.

55:02.369 --> 55:03.440
I will...

55:07.050 --> 55:08.309
give you another chance.

55:10.619 --> 55:11.949
I'll keep an eye on you.

55:12.420 --> 55:13.489
Thank you.

55:17.559 --> 55:20.559
Go see your kids this weekend.

55:21.530 --> 55:22.559
Go on.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.530
By the way, are you pregnant?

55:54.059 --> 55:56.590
It's me. I heard some news.

55:56.590 --> 55:57.929
Come to my gallery.

56:00.329 --> 56:01.500
I think...

56:02.070 --> 56:04.440
I'm too scared to go back to that house.

56:04.800 --> 56:07.139
Don't worry. I'll buy you a new house.

56:08.710 --> 56:09.739
Really?

56:09.940 --> 56:12.980
A Jin bought it for me, but the house is under my name.

56:13.909 --> 56:15.309
We'll meet there from now on.

56:15.309 --> 56:17.150
Only A Jin and I know about that place.

56:17.250 --> 56:20.289
Darling, you're the best.

56:22.619 --> 56:24.619
Look how happy you are.

56:27.030 --> 56:28.190
You were looking for me?

56:29.489 --> 56:32.829
I heard something strange from someone.

56:33.369 --> 56:35.369
Yun Seong Hui and your husband...

56:37.670 --> 56:41.039
Are they together? Is that true?

56:45.809 --> 56:49.150
She had a bruise on her face when she came to say hello.

56:50.349 --> 56:53.349
Did you hit her?

56:54.050 --> 56:55.050
No.

56:55.349 --> 56:57.519
Just tell me.

56:58.159 --> 56:59.860
I don't want pictures drawn from an artist...

56:59.860 --> 57:02.059
who messes around with married men.

57:04.659 --> 57:05.760
I can take them down.

57:09.030 --> 57:11.039
No. Just leave it.

57:12.099 --> 57:13.139
Don't take them down.

57:15.309 --> 57:19.440
That place was a battlefield bombarded with...

57:19.510 --> 57:20.849
desires and pleasure.

57:45.440 --> 57:48.610
I just happened to leave...

57:49.210 --> 57:50.809
the deadly mess...

57:51.340 --> 57:53.679
earlier than others.

58:11.559 --> 58:14.030
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:14.269 --> 58:17.000
She visited me at the gym and gave me an envelope with cash inside.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.340
To make sure she can no longer work as a caregiver.

58:18.340 --> 58:19.739
She told me to hurt her.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.369
Father, he's framing me. I never did such a thing.

58:22.440 --> 58:25.440
Truth doesn't always win in this world.

58:25.940 --> 58:28.409
What wins becomes the truth.

58:28.480 --> 58:31.519
You spoiled, clueless rich woman.

58:32.349 --> 58:35.019
You should look after everything in the house from now on.

58:35.119 --> 58:37.389
We're planning to move out.

58:37.489 --> 58:40.190
Did your abusive husband make you miss being with a sweet guy?

58:40.190 --> 58:41.360
I am pregnant.

58:41.360 --> 58:42.530
Is that why you seduced my husband?

58:42.590 --> 58:44.059
That's right. I seduced him.

58:46.829 --> 58:47.929
My name is Bok...

58:48.030 --> 58:50.139
I'm Park Ji Yeong.

58:50.369 --> 58:51.400
There's only one left now.

58:51.570 --> 58:53.139
What will you do about the younger son's wife?

58:53.469 --> 58:57.539
You may find it hard to believe, but I like you, A Jin.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.309
Yes.

58:59.409 --> 59:02.280
Is it your child? It's not, right?

59:03.010 --> 59:05.849
Who are you going to live with at that house?

59:06.519 --> 59:08.650
A Jin!

59:08.750 --> 59:10.289
- You punk! - Dad!

59:10.289 --> 59:11.320
Have you been cheating on A Jin?

59:12.519 --> 59:13.889
You almost ripped my mouth off.

59:14.190 --> 59:17.199
I love you. I don't want a divorce.

59:17.559 --> 59:19.260
Try to be cool about it, okay?

59:19.260 --> 59:21.300
Just accept it.

59:37.864 --> 59:45.083
