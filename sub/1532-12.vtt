00:02.480 --> 00:04.528
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.882
After five years in hell...

00:07.040 --> 00:09.008
...I have come home with only one goal:

00:09.200 --> 00:11.680
To save my city.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.928
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.043
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.170
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.325
I am something else.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.246
Previously on Arrow:

00:29.120 --> 00:30.360
Don't waste your breath.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.087
Your concern should be for your home
and what's become of it in your absence.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.171
Together, we are gonna
take over the Glades.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.250
The city servicemen,
especially the police, evacuate.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.283
We won't abandon an entire district.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.491
If I even see a hint of a blue,
your city yes-men, they will be buried.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.889
- The mayor will cede control of the Glades.
- It's up to us to stop Brick.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.890
It's not just Oliver's mission anymore.
It is ours.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.167
Are you trying to kill yourself?

01:04.680 --> 01:07.763
- I have to get back.
- You have to rest.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.241
I suppose you planned to leave
without telling me.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.047
Well, I knew that you wouldn't approve.
You saved my life.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.201
- Thank you.
- Maseo saved it.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.641
I merely treated you.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.447
And you're going to undo all that work
if you try to leave now.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.048
I can't stay here any longer.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.971
My sister, my city...

01:32.040 --> 01:34.725
Will mourn your passing, I'm sure.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.490
If you are so concerned...

01:37.240 --> 01:39.527
...just come with me.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.241
You can make sure
that I drink my penicillin tea.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.368
Like Maseo...

01:46.760 --> 01:49.411
...I've disappeared from the world.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.250
I have no desire to return.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.722
Tatsu...

01:55.200 --> 01:57.168
Be well, Oliver.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.724
The Glades have been without
a police presence for a week now.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.724
Daniel Brickwell threatened every member
of local government.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.803
What else was Mayor Castle
supposed to do?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.241
This is worse
than negotiating with terrorists...

02:37.280 --> 02:38.770
Tax time.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.284
Brick wants his cut.
Now give me all the cash in the register.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.047
Or I'll make your head look like that TV.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.924
I have another idea.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.124
Looks like we got ourselves
a real-life superhero here.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.482
You that red streak
I been hearing about on TV?

02:54.680 --> 02:56.091
Wrong city.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.410
Either way,
I bet Brick will pay us a finder's fee.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.371
- Make the call.
- Guns down.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.330
Grant must be some teacher.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.324
Diner at 10th, clear.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.251
- Diner's taken care of.
- He needs help.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.930
Why are these people calling 911?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.686
Don't they know the police have pulled out
of the Glades?

03:31.880 --> 03:34.963
Because they're desperate. They're scared.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.766
Multiple reports of looting
at Western and Oxnard.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.486
Got it. On our way.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.400
Sara?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.485
Someone's dying
here. What are we supposed to do?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.244
You can '1' just ignore us.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.241
- It's Lance.
- Good. Maybe the cavalry's coming.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.527
Captain Lance.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.166
- You've been busy.
- Trying to keep things together.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.641
- Doesn't feel like it's working.
- How can I help?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.561
Can you? The mayor was pretty specific
about blues staying out of the Glades.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.650
Doesn't mean I can't help out
the Hood Squad off the books.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.811
We call ourselves Team Arrow.
Well, actually, that's just me, but...

04:34.040 --> 04:36.361
I got everything we have on Brick
from Evidence.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.887
I'll send Arsenal over
once the next fire's put out.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.686
Arsenal? Are you guys just pulling names
out of a hat now?

04:41.920 --> 04:44.048
Might wanna wrap it up.
Two more calls came in.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.366
Talk soon, captain.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.927
Then there was a
red-hooded guy and a blond woman in black.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.131
- Change in pattern.
- Disrupt and revise, just like you said.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.765
Heh.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.370
Hesitation is death.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.770
I didn't hesitate. I just...

05:25.960 --> 05:28.566
- Just didn't kill you.
- And when the fight is real?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.770
- I'm not a killer.
- Then you're gonna die.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.691
The League of Assassins
are called that for a reason.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.531
Mercy is not part of their code.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.927
I didn't sign up for any of this.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.487
The Assassins' League and no mercy.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.843
All I asked for you to do
was to teach me how to defend myself...

05:48.040 --> 05:49.849
...to never let someone hurt me again.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.811
And now you face people
who wanna kill you.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.129
To prevent that, you must kill them first.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.129
It may not be what you signed up for...

05:58.320 --> 06:01.881
...but make no mistake,
it's what you face right now.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.001
Thea, I know it's difficult.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.647
I wasn't always a killer.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.089
The first time?

06:15.280 --> 06:19.251
I have never been more frightened
or remorseful.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.050
Then why did you do it?

06:21.240 --> 06:25.165
Because the man I killed murdered my wife.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.971
Hey, that's fine.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.364
Put the prospectus on my desk.
We'll get into it tomorrow.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.246
I need to get at least three hours' sleep,
so good night.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.329
No, no, don't! No, don't!

06:39.480 --> 06:42.131
Ha, ha. Tommy.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.970
Don't!

06:46.400 --> 06:48.641
Hey. Tommy, buddy.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.208
Oh. Come here.
You're just having a nightmare. Oh.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.928
- Dad?
- Yeah.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.043
I'm here now.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.250
Don't worry. I won't let
anything bad ever happen to you.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.529
- Promise?
- Promise.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.121
I will always be here for you.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.882
Hey. What...?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.327
What...? Wow.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.200
Where's your mom?

07:17.400 --> 07:21.121
- I don't know. Ingrid put me to sleep.
- Hmm.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.527
Is that Mommy?

07:23.720 --> 07:28.442
Probably. So you'd better go to sleep.
Otherwise, you're gonna get me in trouble.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.643
Captain Lance.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.607
- Harper.
- I'm not sure what...

07:59.800 --> 08:02.167
I've seen you wearing a red hoodie,
shooting arrows.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.045
Think I don't recognize you
with extra leather and lace?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.846
- I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
- No.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.169
- You'll be needing this. Here you go.
- What's this?

08:11.320 --> 08:13.800
Everything on Brickwell
we could salvage from storage.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.731
Maybe something there will help you
figure out where he is.

08:16.920 --> 08:21.289
- Thanks. We'll get Felicity right on this.
- Any word on our green-hooded friend?

08:21.520 --> 08:22.726
Still unavailable.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.880
And Sara?

08:26.080 --> 08:30.210
I mean, I hear the Canary come up
every so often on the 911 calls.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.563
I'll let her know you're looking for her.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.289
No.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.371
You just watch her back, okay?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.169
Always.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.487
If I don't suture this,
it's gonna scar, Laurel.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.445
I'll just add it to my
ever-growing collection.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.120
My father give us anything to use
to locate Brick?

08:56.320 --> 08:59.529
I don't see how.
Some of this stuff goes back decades.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.731
There's plenty of evidence against Brick
but nothing the police can make stick.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.526
So this is what Brick has reduced us to.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.769
Grasping for straws.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.087
I don't know how you guys
have done this for so long.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.481
We had Oliver.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.731
- What are you doing?
- Grasping at straws, I'm pretty sure.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.970
Maybe there's something in Brick's MO that'd
suggest a couple doors for us to kick down.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.531
I mean...

09:24.720 --> 09:26.006
...for you to kick down.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.407
What was that?

09:28.560 --> 09:33.088
Cross-reference with Alderman Ford's murder
in the evidence your father gave us.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.411
The same gun was used
in a 21-year-old shooting.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.170
The same gun?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.761
Either that's arrogance or stupidity.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.801
In this case, definitely stupidity.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.451
The victim from 21 years ago.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.005
Rebecca Merlyn.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.011
Daniel Brickwell killed
Malcolm Merlyn's wife.

10:14.560 --> 10:20.647
If you wanna tell me, "I told you so,"
how about you say it in person?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.324
Just couldn't stay away from me, could you?

10:39.200 --> 10:42.568
- What changed your mind?
- I've been to enough funerals.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.287
- So help me.
- That isn't what I have been doing?

10:47.640 --> 10:49.688
The man who Maseo serves...

10:49.880 --> 10:54.568
...when he finds out that I'm alive,
he is gonna come for me and my sister.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.926
- Ra's al Ghul.
- Yes.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.527
Maseo spoke of him
while you were recuperating.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.569
He fights with swords.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.888
And he's good.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.884
I seem to remember you being pretty good
with a blade yourself.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.604
Mastery of swords
is more than mastery of technique.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.446
To defeat this man, you
must think like him...

11:16.920 --> 11:18.445
...be like him.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.808
You must fight in the ways he does.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.526
Your only hope for such a teacher
was Maseo.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.121
Only the student has hope
of defeating the master.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.928
Sorry I'm late.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.647
What's going on?

11:46.200 --> 11:49.090
- Is it the League?
- No.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.567
This is personal.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.406
Personal how?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.729
I told you I killed the person
who killed my Rebecca.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.844
I recently learned I didn't.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.762
I killed the wrong man.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.769
The guilty party is still alive.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.930
Everything I thought I believed in
for the last 21 years is false.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.640
My wife's death remains unavenged.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.161
So let's go to the police.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.170
Or Laurel Lance, okay?
She's a friend and she'll listen.

12:20.400 --> 12:25.930
I swore that I would always protect her
from harm. But I couldn't.

12:28.680 --> 12:32.287
For years,
I believed that justice had been done.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.844
The Undertaking was for her. I truly
believed I could change the Glades...

12:37.000 --> 12:40.686
...and prevent what happened to my family
from happening to anyone else.

12:40.920 --> 12:45.209
It's all been a lie.
But now I have the chance to set it right.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.482
- I don't understand.
- I know.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.001
Because you're not a killer.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.204
But I am.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.323
Your dad told me
that your mom's an angel now.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.921
I don't want her to be an angel, Ollie.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.691
I want her to go back to being my mom.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.563
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.486
I have a friend in the police department...

13:27.680 --> 13:31.571
...he says that they have a person
of interest in Rebecca's...

13:32.080 --> 13:33.161
In the case.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.886
They don't have enough evidence yet
to convict him...

13:36.080 --> 13:39.243
...but if it were me, I'd wanna know.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.769
Brick killed Malcolm's wife.
What does that have to do with anything?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.083
It is just another reason
for them to share bunk beds in hell.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.250
Not that I believe in hell,
but for them I'll make an exception.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.886
Maybe we should get Merlyn
to solve our Brick problem.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.771
- That's pretty dark.
- If you don't think things are dark...

14:13.960 --> 14:15.689
...you haven't been paying attention.

14:15.880 --> 14:20.249
Even if we did sic Merlyn on Brick, he'd have
as much trouble finding Brick as we've had.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.284
Brick's men have been busy.
They're cutting down cell towers...

14:23.480 --> 14:27.451
...and disconnecting traffic cams
and staying out of satellite line of sight.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.887
Basically, every way I know
how to find somebody.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.607
Well, if the cell towers were down,
how was Brick's crew communicating?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.925
- At the diner. His men, they were...
- They were using walkies.

14:38.120 --> 14:42.648
Do you think that you could, I don't know,
use those signals to locate Brick?

14:42.800 --> 14:46.009
You haven't been down here much.
If they're communicating via radio...

14:46.200 --> 14:49.807
...they'll be on the FRS somewhere
between 462 and 467 megahertz.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.449
If I send out a frequency burst, I should
be able to triangulate their location.

14:54.640 --> 14:59.407
I did not understand one word you just said,
but Oliver was certainly lucky to have you.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.250
114 Grandview Plaza.

15:02.920 --> 15:07.130
- Felicity, that's the Glades precinct.
- Well, it's not like police are using it.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.166
Great. We can add irony
to the list of charges against Brick.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.289
Let's gear up.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.011
Let's go.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.603
Come on, let's go. Move it.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.763
So why don't you explain it to me, boys?

15:30.960 --> 15:34.203
We cleared the register
from that diner on 10th.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.444
No, the part where you had the red one
in front of your shotgun...

15:37.600 --> 15:38.840
...and somehow he's not dead.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.364
You know the deal, boys.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.642
You take me down first, you walk out alive.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.011
Okay, I've cut the power.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.891
There's a ventilation shaft
4O feet north of your position.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.724
They should drop you off in the east wing.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.451
- There are only two sentries there.
- Got it.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.689
If you see anyone, kill them.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.247
You wanna get me?

17:06.280 --> 17:09.045
Roy? Are you there?

17:09.240 --> 17:10.445
Laurel, can you hear me?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.920
This is what we do
when we get you in our sights.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.568
Daniel Brickwell.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.523
What the hell are you supposed to be?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.245
We need to talk.

17:37.120 --> 17:40.488
Somebody please tell me
how this is happening again.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.722
Daniel Brickwell.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.725
It seems we have a common interest.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.208
- You know that Brickwell killed your wife.
- Her name was Rebecca.

17:51.240 --> 17:56.246
Since my death, maintaining my usual
network of associates has become...

17:56.400 --> 17:58.402
...heh, shall we say, problematic.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.001
But the fact you were able
to locate Mr. Brickwell...

18:01.200 --> 18:03.646
...despite the fact
that he has gone to ground...

18:03.840 --> 18:05.763
...demonstrates your group's capacity.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.644
You followed us.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.765
- We led you right to him.
- And I saved your lives in the bargain.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.730
So...

18:13.920 --> 18:16.605
...why not continue our association?

18:16.800 --> 18:20.521
You want us to team up with you?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.283
I guess the question before you is...

18:24.440 --> 18:28.206
...whether your scorn for me outweighs
your need to see Mr. Brickwell dealt with.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.521
You mean killed.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.366
You have your options.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.050
Weigh them.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.481
- Dude, this is awesome.
- Shots on me, bro.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.563
- Here they go. Here they go.
- Yeah.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.004
Cheers.

18:50.360 --> 18:54.888
You stole my idea. I was gonna lean here
and wish my problems away.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.724
That obvious, huh?

18:57.680 --> 19:01.048
- So, what are your problems?
- They're not problems exactly.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.560
More like weighing options.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.165
What about you?
Brick's tax collectors giving you trouble?

19:06.360 --> 19:11.082
No, it's Malcolm, but it's probably the
last thing you wanna think about right now.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.688
- You'd be surprised.
- He found out who murdered his wife.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.929
He's fixated on finding the guy
and killing him.

19:19.160 --> 19:23.404
Don't take this the wrong way, but isn't killing
people exactly what Malcolm Merlyn does?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.688
Yes, but he also protects people.

19:25.880 --> 19:29.885
During the siege, he was the only one
who made me a top priority.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.570
He saved my life.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.767
I didn't know.

19:34.920 --> 19:39.209
Despite everything Malcolm was or is...

19:39.440 --> 19:43.206
...it means something that he was there
when I needed him the most.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.689
Even after everything he's done,
he cares about people.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.123
Even all the terrifying things he's done...

19:51.320 --> 19:54.608
...it was because he thought
that he was helping the Glades.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.131
So, what's on your mind?
Anything I can help you with?

20:02.960 --> 20:06.965
Believe it or not, you already have.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.201
How can you even be arguing for this
right now?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.641
Because I am actually paying attention.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.962
Brick has the Glades under siege.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.841
He has the police running scared.
He has us outnumbered and outgunned.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.647
And I'm not saying
let's give Malcolm a glass case of his own.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.041
All I am saying is...

20:24.280 --> 20:27.568
...let's use him the same way
that he wants to use us.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.328
To point him like a loaded gun at Brick.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.645
- Exactly.
- Well, A, I'm not okay with that.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.242
And B, even if I was, there has to be
a better way to go about doing it...

20:39.440 --> 20:42.125
- ...than to get in bed with Malcolm Merlyn.
- There isn't.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.161
Oliver is gone. And there's only so much
the four of us can do.

20:47.400 --> 20:52.247
I just found this out, but the night
of the siege, Malcolm saved Thea's life.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.844
He didn't have an ulterior motive.
He didn't have an agenda.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.011
He just wanted to protect
what he cared about.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.641
He cares about this city.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.969
He just went about it
in a completely unimaginable way.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.647
So just like Thea did the night
of the siege, we need him.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.844
I can't think of a world or a universe
or a plane of existence...

21:13.040 --> 21:15.850
...where Oliver would agree to any of this.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.169
Oliver isn't here anymore.
We need to stop pretending like he is.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.285
We need to make decisions of our own.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.689
I genuinely have no idea
how else we're supposed to stop Brick.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.441
I genuinely don't know how we live with
ourselves if we go about doing it this way.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.524
So how does this work? Do we vote?

21:47.320 --> 21:48.845
Has the jury reached a verdict?

21:51.040 --> 21:53.088
It has.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.528
- Guilty.
- I guess that means no, then.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.529
You were expecting something different?

21:58.720 --> 22:02.247
What, that you'd have some measure
of common sense? Yes.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.647
You really thought we'd thrown in with you.

22:05.160 --> 22:09.324
After what you did to Thea,
to Sara, to Oliver.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.490
- To save your precious city, yes.
- Well, that's the thing.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.890
Once we let the ends justify the means...

22:16.080 --> 22:17.764
...that's just the first step.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.769
Towards what?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.242
Becoming you.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.605
Excuse me. Excuse me.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.645
Um...

22:39.120 --> 22:40.451
I think I'm lost.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.521
I suggest you run real fast...

22:44.240 --> 22:46.766
...before I swipe that nice watch of yours.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.371
Do you enjoy robbing people?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.805
I mean, it can't be for the money.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.611
You can't steal enough wallets and watches
to live on.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.531
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?
- Wait.

22:57.080 --> 23:01.130
I just wanna understand. I wanna know
what drives a man to do what you do.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.926
To ruin other men's lives.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.121
You want my watch?

23:09.800 --> 23:11.962
Here. Take it.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.926
Because you've already taken
everything from me.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.366
You're not gonna shoot me.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.644
I bet you never even held a gun before.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.442
Go back to your rich neighborhood.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.805
- Is it safe?
- It's safer than a boat.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.562
Your medicine. Apply twice a day.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.211
Okay.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.563
Tatsu.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.161
Would you come with me?

24:17.360 --> 24:20.204
So I can watch you die
at the hands of Maseo's master?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.044
I do not intend to die.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.051
There are many forms of death.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.851
To defeat a man like this Ra's al Ghul...

24:28.040 --> 24:31.203
...you must be willing not just to die...

24:31.400 --> 24:34.802
...but to live knowing what you had
to sacrifice in order to beat him.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.729
And What Will that be?

24:37.400 --> 24:38.686
I don't know.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.725
That is what you will have to discover.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.207
But it will be
whatever you hold most precious.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.884
Going out?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.841
- How did you get in here?
- I had a good teacher.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.611
If you've come to tell me
what a horrible person I am...

25:13.760 --> 25:17.287
...I'm afraid you'll have to wait
in a very long line.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.323
Actually, I'm here to do the opposite.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.203
I told Roy about that night
at the train station.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.129
How you saved my life.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.731
You're my daughter.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.964
You protected me. Risked your life for me.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.124
Just like my mother did.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.608
Thea, I know you wanna believe
there's more to me than a killer...

25:35.800 --> 25:38.804
...but the fact is, there's not.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.801
That man died with his wife.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.531
- What happened to your face?
- Is it all there?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.288
Yeah, 50,000 in hundreds.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.640
You went after Kendrick Weller.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.166
Hey, hey, whoa.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.006
What did you do?

26:19.480 --> 26:22.848
You killed him. And now you're running?

26:23.680 --> 26:26.160
We can... We can cover this up.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.848
I can't stay here.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.362
I can't pretend to be
something that I'm not.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.249
- Your son needs you.
- Not like this.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.002
Killing him did nothing.
It didn't bring her back.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.841
It didn't cleanse this anger.

26:43.520 --> 26:48.367
I've heard about a place where anger can be
forged into something else.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.369
Daddy?

26:51.920 --> 26:54.207
Tommy. He)!-

26:54.880 --> 26:57.884
- What are you doing up? Go back to sleep.
- I miss Mommy.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.209
- Tommy, I have to go away for a little while.
- You can't leave.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.890
You said you'd always be there.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.327
I know. But you have to be strong now.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.369
I'm going somewhere where I can learn...

27:07.560 --> 27:11.326
...how to make sure
that no one will ever hurt us again.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.883
Come here.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.087
How'd Merlyn take it?

27:19.360 --> 27:21.089
I think he just felt inconvenienced.

27:21.800 --> 27:26.203
We made the right choice, right?
By refusing Merlyn's help?

27:26.360 --> 27:30.081
I don't know if we made the right choice,
but we definitely did the right thing.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.322
How many people are gonna die
because of it?

27:32.520 --> 27:35.729
- We made a decision, Roy.
- I know. And I know that I was outvoted.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.042
That doesn't change the fact
that we're outmanned.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.561
What if it doesn't? Roy's right.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.560
We need the support out there. But Merlyn,
he's not the only person in town.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.923
- Who else is there?
- The town.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.763
Hi.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.050
- You've been busy.
- Look, Ted, I was...

27:57.240 --> 28:00.289
I said you weren't ready.
Guess you weren't listening.

28:00.440 --> 28:04.240
Or you gonna tell me that masked blond
that I've seen on the news isn't you?

28:04.440 --> 28:07.649
It's complicated. I couldn't wait.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.922
I didn't come here to argue with you.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.485
What did you come here for?

28:18.240 --> 28:20.129
That a Monte Cristo?

28:20.280 --> 28:22.601
Those will kill you quicker
than this neighborhood.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.290
Abercrombie.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.648
Where the hell have you been? I saw Sara last
night. Why didn't you tell me she was back?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.970
We need to talk about that, after.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.009
After what?

28:40.440 --> 28:43.489
Feels like recess
and we're about to fight the school bully.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.122
- Looks quiet.
- For now.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.769
You ready?

28:50.480 --> 28:53.609
- It's okay to say you're scared.
- Okay, I'm scared.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.810
Is what we're doing crazy?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.480
It's better to ask that
when not wearing a mask.

28:58.640 --> 29:02.804
There's never been an armed occupation
in history that wasn't overthrown by force.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.681
An all-out assault on Brick,
that's the only way to end this.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.842
Then let's end this.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.850
One way...

29:11.040 --> 29:13.008
...or the other.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.165
Let's go.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.046
My two favorite trick-or-treaters.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.847
Well, look at that. Didn't anybody tell you
Halloween was three months ago?

29:37.080 --> 29:40.846
- Daniel Brickwell.
- You have failed this city.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.241
You seemed to have failed in your maths.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.211
Can't you see there's a lot more of us
than there is of you?

29:49.320 --> 29:50.970
Guess again, Brickhead.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.247
Is this little parade supposed
to mean something?

30:00.520 --> 30:02.204
I'll tell you what it means.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.563
It means the population of the Glades
is gonna plummet severely.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.090
Get them.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.240
And which costume are you supposed to be?

30:36.400 --> 30:38.243
Wildcat.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.211
Is that all you got?

31:03.560 --> 31:07.281
I've learned you can survive a bullet,
but not when it's put through your head.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.962
You're gonna be fine.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.325
Really?

31:30.480 --> 31:33.529
How many more of you masks are there?

31:42.800 --> 31:44.802
It's okay.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.891
It's a good thing you fight
better than you lie.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.042
Oliver?

32:08.840 --> 32:11.047
- This is for Rebecca.
- What?

32:13.120 --> 32:14.884
You don't even know her name, do you?

32:20.280 --> 32:23.329
Is this the weapon you used
to murder my wife?

32:23.520 --> 32:26.171
Everybody I dropped was with that piece.

32:26.360 --> 32:30.081
She was a good person. Decent. Kind.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.291
- She ran the clinic right here in the Glades.
- Brunette.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.644
Heh-heh-heh. Yeah, now I remember.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.882
She was my first.

32:40.040 --> 32:44.011
My initiation into the Orchid Bay Butchers.
Heh-heh-heh.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.209
You murdered her
because you wanted into a gang?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.164
No, no.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.244
Because she was weak.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.722
Because she was crying,
begging me not to kill her.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.686
But you won't get that from me.
So come on. Finish it.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.963
Don't do it.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.884
- You are too late.
- Drop the gun.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.366
No more death.

33:13.560 --> 33:16.325
That's easy for you to say.
You just returned from the grave.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.046
Killing him won't balance the scales.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.449
When you have killed 503 people,
including your own son...

33:22.720 --> 33:24.768
...you tend not to worry about scales.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.606
And don't tell me it won't stop the pain
and it won't bring her back...

33:28.760 --> 33:30.762
...because you don't understand.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.364
If I had taken care of him back then...

33:36.720 --> 33:38.609
...it could all be different.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.764
The League, the Undertaking...

33:41.920 --> 33:43.922
...Tommy.

33:45.960 --> 33:51.000
Every choice I have made
since my wife died.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.641
Then you make a different choice now.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.282
For Thea.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.370
Thea will never forgive me.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.961
Start giving her reasons to.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.880
Listen to me. I'm telling you, my guys say
he's out of commission. We can go back in.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.888
I gotta call you back.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.400
There's something I gotta go see.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.404
I've been gone, and I'm sorry.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.491
Sorry for what the city has had to endure
in my absence.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.842
But you did endure it.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.443
And the evidence of that struggle
is lying at my feet.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.844
You did not fail this city.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.847
And I promise
I will not fail you by leaving it again.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.891
I want every block turned upside down,
inside out...

34:56.080 --> 35:01.928
...till each of Brick's dirtbags are lying
on comfy cots in Iron Heights, all right?

35:02.480 --> 35:03.970
Hey. Thanks, captain.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.328
- You should see a doctor.
- No health insurance.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.286
But thanks for bringing the cops back.
Words I never thought I'd say.

35:11.480 --> 35:14.484
- Cindy, right?
- Yeah. I'm friends with your daughter Sara.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.445
I thought you looked familiar.
Haven't seen you in a while.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.486
- I haven't seen Sara in a while.
- Then you missed major ass kicking tonight.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.447
That woman running around
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.246
Heh. Sure it was. Who else would it be?

35:28.440 --> 35:31.091
I don't know. That's why
I'm talking to you.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.840
- What do you mean? I've spoken to her.
- You should know that wasn't your daughter.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.006
You Okay?

35:52.760 --> 35:55.331
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just wanted to see you.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.204
I was worried.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.362
- But are you okay?
- I am, in fact.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.481
- I didn't do it.
- For me?

36:04.960 --> 36:06.849
For me.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.365
But because of you.
ls my room still available?

36:12.640 --> 36:14.324
Where have you been?

36:14.560 --> 36:17.928
- I've been so worried about you.
- I was in Blildhaven.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.850
Ran into an old friend of mine.
Things got, ahem...

36:22.000 --> 36:25.721
...interesting, and I actually spent
the past few weeks in jail.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.443
- I thought you grew out of that.
- So did I.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.161
- Ollie...
- it's okay.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.404
- Good to see you again, Oliver.
- Yeah.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.810
I think I'm hallucinating.
But thank you for being cool with this.

36:44.960 --> 36:48.089
I'm gonna make some tea
and try to keep things Zen.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.250
Thank you for not making this
difficult for her.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.847
I wasn't always like this, you know.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.410
Before Rebecca died, I was a good father.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.681
I remember.

37:03.880 --> 37:08.522
Killing changes you. It takes away a piece of
your soul and you can never get it back again.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.042
Oliver, I know I wasn't there for Tommy...

37:14.360 --> 37:16.488
...but I see Thea as my chance
for redemption.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.364
You turned my sister into a killer...

37:18.560 --> 37:23.043
...and then you put her in the cross hairs of
one of the most dangerous men on the planet.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.811
You won't believe me,
but I did so with a heavy heart...

37:26.000 --> 37:28.890
...and expecting a different outcome.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.171
Ra's is going to come for me.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.410
And he will learn the truth
about Sara eventually.

37:35.640 --> 37:38.564
And then he will come for Thea and me.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.650
- That's why I have to kill him.
- You couldn't before.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.571
This time, I will have you to train me.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.529
Only the student has hope
of defeating the master.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.089
- I am Nyssa, heir to the demon.
- I'm not here to fight you.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.447
There's no other reason to be here.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.729
Why shouldn't I kill you?

38:29.960 --> 38:33.169
- What does that mean?
- "The magician."

38:36.880 --> 38:39.360
Sorry that I didn't come by sooner.

38:41.040 --> 38:44.044
I just wanted to check in on Thea.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.840
It's okay.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.447
I'm okay.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.123
- Merlyn told us you were killed.
- I was close.

38:55.600 --> 39:01.209
I'm sorry that I didn't reach out sooner.
I wasn't exactly in a cell-service area.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.083
You kept the city together.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.964
Saved the Glades. Well done.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.083
It's a gift from Malcolm Merlyn.
He went looking for you.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.001
- It's Ra's al Ghul's, right?
- Yep.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.567
So, what are we gonna do about him?

39:21.760 --> 39:26.482
- I mean, if he finds out about Thea...
- Merlyn and I are working on that.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.920
Sorry.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.161
For a second there,
it sounded like you said Merlyn.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.250
I need to know how to defeat Ra's.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.929
- Merlyn has the knowledge.
- Merlyn is a monster.

39:38.120 --> 39:42.045
You're in this situation,
Thea is in this situation, because of him.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.447
- Felicity...
- No. Just a few hours ago...

39:44.640 --> 39:47.962
...I stood right here,
and I swore that there was no way...

39:48.160 --> 39:51.289
...that you would ever agree
to work with Malcolm Merlyn. Not ever.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.043
I guess I was wrong about everything.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.690
I need some air. I'm glad you're not dead.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.445
Felicity.

40:12.680 --> 40:17.447
"I need some air" really means
I don't want to talk right now.

40:17.880 --> 40:21.282
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

40:22.200 --> 40:24.407
Maybe you could be a little more specific.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.887
For letting us believe you were dead...

40:27.080 --> 40:28.923
...for weeks?

40:29.320 --> 40:31.800
Or for abandoning every principle
you claim to have...

40:31.960 --> 40:33.962
...by getting into bed with Malcolm Merlyn?

40:35.640 --> 40:37.688
- I...
- Mm-mm.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.689
- That's not why you're upset.
- While you were gone...

40:42.880 --> 40:46.123
...for almost a month...

40:47.400 --> 40:51.086
...I allowed myself to fantasize...

40:51.280 --> 40:55.410
...to dream that maybe, just maybe...

40:55.600 --> 40:57.967
...Merlyn was wrong.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.890
That you were alive
and that you would come back.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.367
And that when you did,
you would be different.

41:04.600 --> 41:09.208
That almost dying would give you
a new perspective on life.

41:09.400 --> 41:14.691
- That you would just do things differently.
- Things between us, you mean.

41:16.080 --> 41:20.688
Before you left,
the last thing you said to me...

41:22.800 --> 41:24.484
...was that you loved me.

41:27.560 --> 41:32.168
Now you're back, and the first thing you tell
me is that you are working with the man...

41:32.360 --> 41:35.170
...who turned your sister,
a woman you're supposed to love...

41:35.360 --> 41:39.206
...into a killer
who killed a woman you used to love.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.571
I don't want to be a woman that you love.
