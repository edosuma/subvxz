00:04.482 --> 00:08.878
So, I have what I've been told
is a moral dilemma.

00:08.921 --> 00:12.186
Whatever your gut is telling
you, do the opposite.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.579
That's what I thought at first,
so I switched,

00:14.623 --> 00:17.017
but that made me think
I should switch again.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.366
So now where am I?

00:18.409 --> 00:19.628
I'm going back
to my phone.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.586
Give me a nudge
when she gets to it.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.980
Patrick's getting married.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.851
And the phone is down.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.550
I feel like he and Christy
just broke up.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.725
They did.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.248
Men are pigs.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.381
Unless he reconnected
with a long-lost love.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.383
In that case, aw.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.211
It's the fitness model.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.387
He hid the ring
in her "a-sigh" bowl.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.432
It thought it was "a-kye."

00:41.476 --> 00:43.260
You're both wrong.
It's "ah-sigh-ee."

00:43.304 --> 00:45.436
Who cares how you say it?

00:45.480 --> 00:47.264
It's just sherbert.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.005
Actually, it's "sher-bit."

00:49.049 --> 00:51.268
Okay, good-bye.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.053
Stop.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.229
How's Christy taking it?

00:55.272 --> 00:56.665
She doesn't know.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.667
Welcome to
the aforementioned dilemma.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.103
Why haven't you told her?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.671
Because Adam's taking me away
for a romantic weekend

01:02.714 --> 01:04.412
at a spa resort in Reno.

01:04.455 --> 01:05.282
Ooh...
Oh...
Oh...

01:05.326 --> 01:08.024
In theory, "Oh..."

01:08.068 --> 01:09.982

making sweet love to Adam

01:10.026 --> 01:11.419

01:18.382 --> 01:20.776

01:20.819 --> 01:22.647
Bonnie, part of
being a mother

01:22.691 --> 01:24.519
is putting your
child before you.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.173

a hot stone massage.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.139
She's looking at a lifetime
of partial views.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.054
Exactly. I can just as easily

01:38.098 --> 01:40.012
