WEBVTT

00:03.259 --> 00:06.700
The Ood.
They came from a distant world.

00:06.735 --> 00:09.300
They voyaged across the stars.

00:09.335 --> 00:11.625
All with one purpose.

00:11.660 --> 00:13.818
Do you take milk and sugar?

00:13.854 --> 00:16.236
- To serve!
- Oh, that's good.

00:16.271 --> 00:18.584
That's excellent. I like it, sir.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.945
Buy one now!
Direct, straight to the point!

00:20.980 --> 00:24.699
We play that across the Tri-Galactic
for two weeks, then introduce this.

00:24.734 --> 00:27.144
Now only 50 credits.

00:27.179 --> 00:29.945
50? We're reducing the
price to 50 credits?

00:29.980 --> 00:33.699
Sales are down, we've got to
reposition ourselves. So get going.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.185
Idiot! Bleeding us dry.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.300
You there, get me last month's
military export figures.

00:40.335 --> 00:42.539
The army always need more grunts.

00:42.574 --> 00:45.264
Yes, sir.

00:45.299 --> 00:47.424
Mr. Bartle, you asked me to call you?

00:47.459 --> 00:51.539
Solana, when those buyers arrive, we
are going to pitch like never before.

00:51.574 --> 00:53.740
I want those Ood flying out of here!

00:55.299 --> 00:58.700
That... I said military figures,
that's the domestic file.

00:58.735 --> 01:01.104
Get me the military!

01:01.139 --> 01:03.139
The file is irrelevant, sir.

01:03.174 --> 01:04.905
Oh, and why's that?

01:04.940 --> 01:08.128
- Aargh!
- Have a nice day!

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

01:52.259 --> 01:55.499
Set the controls to random.
Mystery tour!

01:55.534 --> 01:56.599
Outside that door

01:56.600 --> 02:00.418
could be any planet, anywhere, anywhen,
in the whole, wide uni... Are you alright?

02:00.419 --> 02:01.900
Terrified.

02:02.099 --> 02:05.100
I mean, history's one thing,
but an alien planet!

02:05.101 --> 02:06.801
I could always take you home.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.658
- Yeah, don't laugh at me.
- I know what it's like.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.505
Everything you're feeling right now.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.180
The fear, the joy, the wonder.
I get that.

02:14.215 --> 02:16.184
Seriously? After all this time?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.859
Yeah! Why do you think I keep going?

02:18.894 --> 02:21.499
Oh, all right then. You and me both.

02:21.534 --> 02:23.544
This is barmy!

02:23.579 --> 02:26.819
I was born in Chiswick!
I've only ever done package holidays.

02:26.854 --> 02:30.185
Now I'm here! This is...

02:30.220 --> 02:32.379
I mean it's...
I dunno, it's all sort of...

02:32.414 --> 02:34.499
I don't even know what the word is!

02:38.140 --> 02:40.979
Oh, I've got the word.

02:41.014 --> 02:43.145
Freezing!

02:43.180 --> 02:45.919
Snow! Ah, real snow.

02:45.954 --> 02:48.624
Proper snow at last!

02:48.659 --> 02:50.779
That's more like it, lovely!
What do you think?

02:50.814 --> 02:53.260
- Bit cold.
- Look at that view!

02:53.295 --> 02:54.864
Yep.

02:54.899 --> 02:56.424
Beautiful, cold view.

02:56.459 --> 02:59.980
Millions of planets in millions
of galaxies, and we're on this one!

03:00.015 --> 03:02.424
Molto bene! Bellissimo!

03:02.459 --> 03:04.984
Says Donna. Born in Chiswick.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.560
Oh, you've had a life
of work and sleep...

03:07.561 --> 03:10.761
...and telly, and rent
and tax and takeaway dinners.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.779
All birthdays and Christmases

03:13.780 --> 03:16.980
and two weeks holiday a year.
And then you end up here.

03:17.015 --> 03:19.397
Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.779
Standing on a different planet!

03:21.814 --> 03:23.219
How about that, Donna?

03:24.859 --> 03:27.704
Donna?

03:27.739 --> 03:30.399
- Sorry, you were saying?
- Better?

03:30.434 --> 03:32.172
- Lovely, thanks.
- Comfy?

03:32.250 --> 03:32.924
Yup.

03:33.059 --> 03:36.059
- Can you hear anything inside that?
- Pardon?

03:36.094 --> 03:39.059
Right, I was saying,
citizen of the Earth.

03:40.694 --> 03:41.911
A rocket!

03:42.019 --> 03:45.159
Blimey, a real, proper rocket!

03:45.860 --> 03:48.300
Now, that's what I call a spaceship.

03:48.335 --> 03:51.177
You've got a box,
he's got a Ferrari!

03:51.212 --> 03:54.020
Come on, let's see where he's going.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.700
Mr. Halpen, sir.
Dr. Ryder, new Head of Ood Management.

04:01.735 --> 04:03.665
How many dead? Come on,
facts and figures.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.839
I haven't flown all this way to discuss the
weather. Which by the way is freezing.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.385
Solana has the figures, sir.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.560
Solana Mercurio, sir. Head of
Marketing and Galactic Liaison.

04:10.561 --> 04:12.361
That's just what I need, a PR woman

04:12.460 --> 04:14.620
I don't want a word of this
getting out, is that understood?

04:14.655 --> 04:17.825
Now, get to the point.
How many dead?

04:17.860 --> 04:21.059
In the past financial quarter, we've
had three deaths in the complex.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.105
All attributed to heart attacks
or industrial accidents.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.700
But now we've captured this on tape,
the cause would seem the same.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.537
It's using the translator ball
as a weapon. How's that work?

04:30.572 --> 04:33.339
I've no idea. I'm checking
the equipment, nothing so far.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.500
Can't see its eyes from this angle.

04:35.535 --> 04:37.024
I think we have to assume...

04:37.059 --> 04:38.779
- Red-eye.
- I would think so, sir.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.265
That Ood, what happened to it?

04:40.300 --> 04:41.904
Ran for the wilds, sir, like a dog.

04:41.939 --> 04:45.140
One of the guards fired off a shot,
it'll be dead by now.

04:45.175 --> 04:46.865
Can I ask, what's red-eye, sir?

04:46.900 --> 04:50.094
It's some sort of infection.
The Ood eyes literally change colour.

04:50.100 --> 04:50.844
Drink!

04:50.850 --> 04:54.100
I can't find the source,
all the bacterial scans register negative.

04:54.220 --> 04:58.580
I'm sorry, but according to your own rules,
sir, there's no alcohol allowed on base.

04:58.615 --> 05:01.180
It's hair tonic, if you must know.

05:04.099 --> 05:06.460
Five years ago,
I had a full head of hair.

05:06.495 --> 05:09.419
Stress, that's what this is, stress!

05:22.027 --> 05:23.496
Hold on, can you hear that?

05:24.593 --> 05:26.252
Donna. Take your hood down.

05:27.079 --> 05:27.951
What?

05:28.940 --> 05:30.700
That noise, is like a song.

05:32.996 --> 05:34.420
Over there!

05:36.985 --> 05:38.104
What is it?

05:38.139 --> 05:40.415
An Ood. He's called an Ood.

05:40.855 --> 05:42.584
But its face...

05:42.619 --> 05:45.530
Donna, don't. Not now.
It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand.

05:46.615 --> 05:47.740
Sorry!

05:48.980 --> 05:51.940
I don't know where the heart is.
I don't know if he's GOT a heart.

05:51.975 --> 05:53.877
Talk to him, keep him going.

05:53.912 --> 05:55.780
It's all right, we've got you.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.980
Um, what's your name?

06:00.015 --> 06:02.019
Designated Ood

06:02.054 --> 06:03.779
Delta 50.

06:06.739 --> 06:08.304
My name's Donna.

06:08.339 --> 06:10.300
No, no, no, no. You don't need to...

06:10.335 --> 06:12.465
Sorry.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.384
Oh, God! This is the Doctor!

06:15.419 --> 06:19.300
Just what you need, a doctor.
Couldn't be better, eh?

06:19.335 --> 06:20.984
You've been shot.

06:21.019 --> 06:23.020
The circle... No, don't try to talk.

06:23.055 --> 06:24.584
The circle must be broken.

06:24.619 --> 06:27.459
Circle? What do you mean?
Delta 50, what circle?

06:27.494 --> 06:30.059
Delta 50, what circle?

06:30.094 --> 06:32.060
Aargh!

06:38.460 --> 06:40.620
He's gone.

06:40.655 --> 06:42.780
Careful.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.379
There you are, sweetheart.

06:48.180 --> 06:51.980
We were too late. What do we do,
do we bury him or...?

06:52.015 --> 06:54.740
The snow will take care of that.

06:54.775 --> 06:56.344
Who was he? What's an Ood?

06:56.379 --> 07:00.419
They're servants,
of humans in the 42nd century.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.660
Mildly telepathic, that was the song.

07:02.695 --> 07:05.340
It was his mind calling out.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.819
Couldn't hear anything.

07:09.499 --> 07:11.185
He sang as he was dying.

07:11.220 --> 07:14.420
- His eyes turned red.
- What's that mean?

07:14.455 --> 07:16.984
Trouble. Come on.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.584
The Ood are harmless.
They're completely benign.

07:19.619 --> 07:22.819
Except, the last time I met them,
there was this force,

07:22.854 --> 07:26.019
like a stronger mind,
powerful enough to take them over.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.637
- What sort of force?
- Long story.

07:28.672 --> 07:31.185
- Long walk.
- It was the Devil.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.979
If you're gonna take the mickey,
I'll just put my hood back up.

07:34.014 --> 07:36.460
Must be something different
this time, though.

07:36.495 --> 07:38.819
Something closer to home.

07:38.854 --> 07:40.985
A- ha!

07:41.020 --> 07:43.340
Civilisation!

07:44.779 --> 07:47.945
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Ood-Sphere.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.759
And isn't it bracing?
Here are your information packs,

07:50.760 --> 07:54.360
with vouchers, 3D tickets
and a map of the complex.

07:55.059 --> 07:56.860
My name's Solana,
Head of Marketing.

07:56.861 --> 07:58.961
I'm sure we've all spoken
on the vidfone.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.059
- Now, if you'd like to follow me.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry! Late.

08:01.094 --> 08:03.136
Don't mind us. Hello!
The guards let us through.

08:03.171 --> 08:05.144
And you would be?
The Doctor and Donna Noble.

08:05.179 --> 08:08.979
Representing the Noble Corporation
PLC Limited, Intergalactic.

08:09.014 --> 08:12.136
Must have fallen off my list,
my apologies. Won't happen again.

08:12.171 --> 08:14.955
Now then, Dr. Noble, Mrs. Noble,
if you'd like to come with me.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.740
- Oh, no, no, we're not married! Never.
- We're so not married.

08:17.775 --> 08:19.665
- Never ever!
- Of course.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.105
And here are your information
packs, vouchers inside.

08:22.140 --> 08:25.940
Now if you'd like to come with me,
the Executive Suites are nice and warm.

08:25.975 --> 08:29.104
Ooh, what's that? That sounds like an alarm.

08:29.139 --> 08:32.259
For God's sake, we've got the buyers
arriving, who sounded the alarm? Drink!

08:32.294 --> 08:35.340
Oh, it's just a siren
for the end of the work shift.

08:35.341 --> 08:37.541
Now then, this way,
quick as you can!

08:39.380 --> 08:42.384
- Mr. Kess, what the hell's going on?
- Ood on the loose, sir.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.397
- Looks like we've got another one.
- Red-eye?

08:44.400 --> 08:45.442
<i>As red as sin, sir.</i>

08:45.495 --> 08:47.020
Don't worry, Mr. Halpen, we're on it.

08:47.055 --> 08:48.504
Sir!

08:48.539 --> 08:51.105
Alright, lads.
Go, get him!

08:51.140 --> 08:57.179
As you can see, the Ood are happy to serve, and
we keep them in facilities of the highest standard.

08:58.619 --> 09:01.019
Here at the Double O
that's Ood Operations

09:01.020 --> 09:04.148
<i>we like to think
of the Ood as our trusted friends.</i>

09:04.150 --> 09:06.744
You two go left. You two follow me.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.539
We keep the Ood healthy,
safe, and educated.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.712
Take him alive!

09:12.940 --> 09:15.220
<i>We don't just breed the Ood.</i>

09:15.255 --> 09:17.016
We make them better.

09:17.901 --> 09:19.948
Becuase at heart, what is an Ood?

09:21.010 --> 09:22.966
But a reflection of us?

09:23.799 --> 09:26.380
If your Ood is happy...

09:26.415 --> 09:29.105
Aaargh!

09:29.140 --> 09:30.739
.. then you'll be happy, too.

09:33.539 --> 09:38.339
Mr. Halpen, this is a bit more
than red-eye, sir.

09:38.374 --> 09:40.300
This is something new,

09:40.335 --> 09:42.597
it's rabid, sir.

09:43.471 --> 09:44.825
Take it to Dr. Ryder.

09:44.860 --> 09:47.598
Just get it out of sight!

09:48.339 --> 09:50.300
<i>Sales figures needed by 1900, sir.</i>

09:50.695 --> 09:52.219
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:59.939 --> 10:02.460
What do you think?
Growing back?

10:02.495 --> 10:03.939
Just a little bit?

10:06.220 --> 10:08.465
Like you'd know!

10:08.500 --> 10:12.259
I'd now like to point out a new
innovation from Ood Operations.

10:12.294 --> 10:16.019
We've introduced a variety package
with the Ood translator ball.

10:16.054 --> 10:18.020
You can now have
the Standard Setting.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.824
How are you today, Ood?

10:19.859 --> 10:21.984
I'm perfectly well,
thank you.

10:22.019 --> 10:25.780
Or perhaps, after a stressful day, a
little something for the gentlemen.

10:25.815 --> 10:27.305
And how are you, Ood?

10:27.340 --> 10:29.344
All the better for seeing you.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.539
And the comedy classic option.
Ood, you dropped something.

10:32.574 --> 10:34.545
D'oh!

10:34.580 --> 10:37.739
All that for only five
additional credits.

10:37.774 --> 10:39.704
The details are in your brochures.

10:39.739 --> 10:43.619
Now, there's plenty more food
and drink, so, don't hold back.

10:51.299 --> 10:53.504
Ah, got it!

10:53.539 --> 10:58.900
The Ood-Sphere, I've been to this
solar system before, years ago, ages!

10:58.935 --> 11:01.100
Close to the planet Sense-Sphere.

11:01.135 --> 11:02.540
Widen out.

11:06.499 --> 11:12.700
The year 4126. That is the Second
Great and Bountiful Human Empire.

11:12.735 --> 11:14.944
4126.

11:14.979 --> 11:17.664
It's 4126.

11:17.699 --> 11:21.860
- I'm in 4126.
- It's good, isn't it?

11:21.895 --> 11:23.465
What's the Earth like now?

11:23.500 --> 11:27.340
Bit full. But you see, the Empire
stretches out across three galaxies.

11:27.375 --> 11:30.144
It's weird.
I mean, it's brilliant, but...

11:30.179 --> 11:34.140
Back home, the papers and the telly
keep saying we haven't got long to live.

11:34.175 --> 11:36.544
Global warming. Flooding.

11:36.579 --> 11:38.759
- All the bees disappearing.
- Yeah,

11:39.659 --> 11:41.799
that thing about the bees is odd.

11:42.059 --> 11:44.625
But look at us!
We're everywhere.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.380
Is that good or bad, though?
Are we like explorers?

11:47.415 --> 11:50.260
- Or more like a virus?
- Sometimes I wonder.

11:50.295 --> 11:52.077
What are the red dots?

11:52.112 --> 11:53.985
Ood distribution centres.

11:54.020 --> 11:55.824
Across three galaxies?

11:55.859 --> 11:57.580
Don't the Ood get a say in this?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.460
Um, sorry, but...

12:06.380 --> 12:10.060
Hello. Tell me,
are you ALL like this?

12:10.095 --> 12:11.864
I do not understand, Miss.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.940
Why do you say "Miss",
do I look single?

12:13.975 --> 12:16.025
- Back to the point.
- Yeah.

12:16.060 --> 12:19.625
What I mean is,
are there any free Ood?

12:19.660 --> 12:23.860
Are there Ood running wild
somewhere? Like wildebeest.

12:23.895 --> 12:25.657
All Ood are born to serve.

12:25.692 --> 12:27.385
Otherwise, we would die.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.984
But you can't have
started like that.

12:30.019 --> 12:34.140
- Before the humans, what were you like?
- The circle.

12:34.175 --> 12:36.097
What do you mean,
what circle?

12:36.132 --> 12:37.984
The circle, the circle is...

12:38.019 --> 12:41.500
Ladies and gentlemen! All Ood
to Hospitality Stations, please.

12:41.535 --> 12:44.224
I've had enough of the schmoozing.

12:44.259 --> 12:47.660
- Do you fancy going off the beaten track?
- (Solana) Now if I can introduce you...

12:47.695 --> 12:51.082
- Rough Guide to the Ood-Sphere? Works for me.
- Yeah.

12:51.899 --> 12:54.279
What the hell
is wrong with it?

12:54.314 --> 12:56.660
It's obviously stage two of red-eye.

12:56.695 --> 12:58.185
Whatever that means.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.980
Ood Sigma, have you
seen this before?

13:01.015 --> 13:02.737
Humanity defines us, sir.

13:02.772 --> 13:04.816
We look to you for answers.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.825
Fat lot of good, all of you.

13:06.860 --> 13:11.060
We're exporting hundreds of thousands
of Ood to all the civilised planets.

13:11.095 --> 13:13.465
If they turn rabid,
you know what it'll mean.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.519
There's only one thing
I haven't checked, sir. Warehouse 15.

13:17.554 --> 13:19.741
Why should that cause trouble?
It's been two centuries now.

13:19.742 --> 13:21.327
No change. Not ever. Drink.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.499
I know it's restricted access, but if I'm
going to work on this, I should see it.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.200
Just in case.

13:26.499 --> 13:29.105
Can't stand the place.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.660
Still. Warehouse 15 then, come on.

13:32.695 --> 13:34.299
What about this one, sir?

13:36.260 --> 13:38.464
Well, I'd suggest a post mortem.

13:38.499 --> 13:40.460
Which means it's
got to be dead first.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.825
<i>Ood shift eight, now commencing.</i>

13:50.860 --> 13:55.998
<i>Repeat, Ood shift eight now commencing.</i>

14:14.659 --> 14:17.819
Get up! I said get up!

14:17.854 --> 14:20.980
Servants? They're slaves.

14:21.015 --> 14:23.157
Get up!

14:23.192 --> 14:25.265
March!

14:25.300 --> 14:28.659
Last time I met the Ood,
I never thought. I never asked.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.160
- That's not like you.
- I was busy.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.460
So busy I couldn't save them,
I had to let the Ood die.

14:34.461 --> 14:36.461
I reckon I owe them one.

14:37.460 --> 14:41.260
- That looks like the boss.
- Let's keep out of his way. Come on.

14:44.299 --> 14:46.620
How long since you went inside?

14:46.655 --> 14:50.460
Must be... ten years ago.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.989
<i>Warehouse 15.</i>

14:55.000 --> 14:57.242
My father brought me here, when I was six years old.

14:57.245 --> 14:59.004
<i>Security protocol initiated.</i>

14:59.010 --> 15:00.199
God, the stench of it.

15:00.205 --> 15:03.340
<i>Warehouse 15. Door open.</i>

15:16.420 --> 15:18.504
Incredible.

15:18.539 --> 15:22.340
Like I said.
Nothing's changed.

15:25.059 --> 15:29.079
I've read the documents, but...
it doesn't quite prepare you.

15:29.114 --> 15:32.227
Is it just me, or does it feel
as if it's looking at you?

15:32.262 --> 15:35.340
I think I understand
the barrier mechanics well enough.

15:35.941 --> 15:38.041
I'll check the signal.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.520
Suppose it's home sweet home to you.
What d'you think?

15:43.740 --> 15:47.780
- I have no opinion, sir.
- Well...

15:47.815 --> 15:50.424
say hello to Daddy.

15:50.459 --> 15:53.360
Nothing. The barrier's intact.
No abnormal signal.

15:53.361 --> 15:55.361
Same as it's been for 200 years.

15:57.380 --> 16:02.260
<i>Mr. Halpen, the two people from the Noble
Corporation failed to pass security checks.</i>

16:02.295 --> 16:05.659
There's no such company,
the Noble Corporation doesn't exist.

16:05.694 --> 16:08.539
And on top of that, they seem
to have gone missing, sir,

16:08.574 --> 16:10.665
<i>the Doctor and Miss Noble.</i>

16:10.700 --> 16:14.579
Just what I need
Start a search, no alarms, got that?

16:14.614 --> 16:16.425
Keep it quiet.

16:17.745 --> 16:20.099
You see? Hair loss! Drink!

16:23.699 --> 16:27.820
Tell you what, old friend.
Have this one on me.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.900
Cheers!

16:33.979 --> 16:36.179
I think we're finished here.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.554
Sorry.

16:56.739 --> 17:00.060
- Where d'you learn to whistle?
- West Ham, every Saturday.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.145
Ood export.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.505
D'you see?
Lifts up the containers,

17:22.540 --> 17:26.579
takes them to the rocket sheds,
ready to be flown out,

17:26.615 --> 17:29.265
all over the three galaxies...

17:29.300 --> 17:32.700
What, you mean,
these containers are full of..?

17:32.735 --> 17:35.060
What d'you think?

17:41.099 --> 17:43.859
Ohhh, it stinks!

17:45.580 --> 17:48.700
How many of them
do you think there are in each one?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.600
A hundred? More?

17:50.601 --> 17:54.101
A great big
empire, built on slavery.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.899
- It's not so different from your time.
- Oy! I haven't got slaves!

17:57.934 --> 17:59.520
Who d'you think made your clothes?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.921
Is that why you travel
round with a human

18:03.020 --> 18:06.979
at your side? It's not so you can
show them the wonders of the universe,

18:07.014 --> 18:09.379
it's so you can take cheap shots?

18:09.414 --> 18:12.179
- Sorry.
- Well, don't.

18:12.214 --> 18:14.425
Space Man.

18:14.460 --> 18:18.665
I don't understand, the door was
open, why don't you just run away?

18:18.700 --> 18:20.966
- For what reason?
- You could be free.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.632
I do not understand the concept.

18:24.295 --> 18:26.984
What is it with that Persil ball?

18:27.019 --> 18:28.760
I mean, they're not born with it,
are they?

18:28.761 --> 18:30.861
Why do they have to be
all plugged in?

18:31.060 --> 18:33.820
Ood, tell me, does 'the circle'
mean anything to you?

18:33.855 --> 18:36.779
The circle must be broken.

18:36.814 --> 18:39.305
Woah, that is creepy!

18:39.340 --> 18:43.420
- But what is it? What is the circle?
- The circle must be broken.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.704
Why?

18:44.739 --> 18:47.945
So that we can sing.

18:47.980 --> 18:54.020
Mr. Halpen? I'm in Ood Cargo,
I've found your unwanted guests. Go!

18:54.055 --> 18:57.537
Oh, I think that's us! Come on!

18:57.572 --> 19:00.985
Cut the alarms! I said, no alarms!

19:01.020 --> 19:04.940
Nothing to worry about, ladies and
gentlemen, it's just a fire drill.

19:04.975 --> 19:09.380
We test the system at this time
every day. If you'll excuse me.

19:15.499 --> 19:18.300
Doctor, there's a door!

19:19.310 --> 19:20.300
Don't move...

19:20.800 --> 19:22.418
- Where've you gone?
- (Guard) Stay where you are.

19:24.140 --> 19:27.779
Get off me! Get off me!

19:34.100 --> 19:37.220
Donna! Where are you?

19:38.600 --> 19:39.776
All guards withdraw.

19:39.777 --> 19:40.088
<i>Sir?</i>

19:40.090 --> 19:41.514
I said withdraw.

19:41.934 --> 19:45.020
Keep to the perimeter.
I've got this one.

19:50.339 --> 19:53.699
I've always wanted to do this.

19:59.180 --> 20:01.940
Container locked. Ahh!

20:14.300 --> 20:17.020
Can you help me?

20:17.055 --> 20:19.740
Oh, no, you don't!

20:31.259 --> 20:35.060
What have I done? I'm not one
of that lot. I'm on YOUR side!

20:45.437 --> 20:48.100
Stay where you are.
That's an order.

20:48.135 --> 20:52.259
I said, stay! Doctor! Doctor...!

21:11.619 --> 21:14.339
You heard the instructions.
Mr. Halpen wants them alive.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.544
Doctor, get me out!

21:17.579 --> 21:20.184
<i>Doctor, get me out of here!</i>

21:20.185 --> 21:22.875
If you don't do what she says,
you're really in trouble.

21:23.339 --> 21:26.900
- Not from me, from her.
- Unlock the container!

21:28.060 --> 21:32.666
- Doctor!
- There we go, safe and sound.

21:32.701 --> 21:35.300
Never mind about me,
what about them?!

21:36.620 --> 21:40.500
Red alert! Fire!

21:41.379 --> 21:43.900
Shoot to kill!

22:01.339 --> 22:02.779
If people back on Earth...

22:02.780 --> 22:05.480
- knew what was going on here...
- Oh, don't be so stupid.

22:05.579 --> 22:06.600
Of course they know.

22:06.601 --> 22:10.001
- They know how you treat the Ood?
- They don't ask. Same thing.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.646
Solana, the Ood aren't born like this.
They can't be. A species born to serve...

22:13.647 --> 22:16.200
could never evolve in the first place.
What does the company do to make them obey?

22:16.281 --> 22:18.881
- That's nothing to do with me!
- Oh, what, cos you don't ask?

22:19.380 --> 22:23.459
- That's Dr. Ryder's territory.
- And where's he? What part of the complex?

22:23.494 --> 22:26.465
I could help,
with the red-eye, now show me!

22:26.500 --> 22:29.940
- There... Beyond the red section.
- Come with me.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.980
You've seen the warehouse,
you can't agree with all this.

22:33.015 --> 22:36.380
You know this place better than me,
you could help.

22:39.580 --> 22:44.105
They're over here!
Guards! They're over here!

22:44.140 --> 22:48.379
Male and female suspects escaped.
Wasteridge corridor.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.206
Mr. Halpen, I found the Doctor.
He's heading for Ood Conversion.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.145
<i>On my way.</i>

22:59.148 --> 23:01.037
Mr. Kess, what's the situation?

23:01.220 --> 23:06.500
We've contained it, sir, fenced them in. But the red
eye seems to be permanent this time, it's not fading.

23:06.535 --> 23:09.545
Worse than that, sir...
there's more of them going rabid.

23:09.580 --> 23:13.580
My opinion, sir, I think we've lost
them. The entire batch, contaminated.

23:13.615 --> 23:18.100
What's causing it?
Why now? What's changed?

23:23.980 --> 23:26.640
- How many Ood, in total?
- I'd say about 2,000, sir.

23:26.675 --> 23:29.265
<i>We can write them off,
that's what insurance is for.</i>

23:29.300 --> 23:33.859
Drink! We've plenty more on the
Breeding Farms, let's start again.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.695
Fetch the canisters.

23:40.696 --> 23:41.847
<i>No survivors.</i>

23:42.100 --> 23:45.099
My pleasure, sir.
You lot. Canisters.

23:56.140 --> 23:58.824
Oh, can you hear it?

23:58.859 --> 24:02.060
I didn't need the map,
I should've listened.

24:08.739 --> 24:12.139
- Hold on. Does that mean we're locked in?
- Listen.

24:12.174 --> 24:15.539
Listen, listen, listen, listen...

24:24.579 --> 24:26.585
Oh, my head!

24:26.620 --> 24:29.140
- What is it?
- Can't you hear it?

24:29.175 --> 24:31.139
The singing?

24:51.169 --> 24:53.784
They look different to the others.

24:53.819 --> 24:57.740
That's because they're
natural-born Ood, unprocessed,

24:57.775 --> 25:00.779
before they're adapted to slavery.
Unspoilt.

25:04.060 --> 25:08.700
- That's their song.
- I can't hear it.

25:08.735 --> 25:10.979
D'you want to?

25:12.859 --> 25:14.019
Yeah.

25:15.259 --> 25:19.260
It's the song of captivity.
Let me hear it.

25:19.295 --> 25:21.820
Face me.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.544
Open your mind, that's it.

25:28.579 --> 25:31.744
Hear it, Donna.

25:31.779 --> 25:36.459
- Hear the music.
- Oh...!

25:49.900 --> 25:51.840
Take it away.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.745
You sure?

25:53.780 --> 25:55.979
I can't bear it.

26:00.299 --> 26:01.799
I'm sorry.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.299
That's OK.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.620
But you can still hear it?

26:12.579 --> 26:14.579
All the time.

26:19.700 --> 26:20.660
Come on. What's the hold-up?

26:20.661 --> 26:24.061
It's the experimentation lab,
maximum security, he's fused the system.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.359
Don't just stand there, get the
bolt-cutters, rip that door off!

26:27.160 --> 26:28.760
Solana, go back to the reps,

26:29.059 --> 26:30.600
I don't want any of them
wandering off and seeing this.

26:30.601 --> 26:33.301
And get them away
from the Ood, just in case.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.779
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

26:40.218 --> 26:41.300
They're breaking in.

26:41.335 --> 26:43.859
Ah, let them.

26:44.899 --> 26:47.339
What are you holding? Show me.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.184
Friend.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.384
Doctor. Donna. Friend.

26:54.419 --> 26:58.140
Let me see... Look at me...

26:58.175 --> 27:00.305
Let me see.

27:00.340 --> 27:03.580
That's it. That's it, go on. Go on...

27:09.539 --> 27:11.465
Is that...?

27:11.500 --> 27:14.064
It's a brain. A hind brain.

27:14.099 --> 27:18.024
The Ood are born with a secondary
brain. Like the amygdala in humans,

27:18.059 --> 27:22.540
it processes memory and emotions. Get rid of that and
you wouldn't be Donna any more. You'd be like an Ood,

27:22.575 --> 27:26.339
- a processed Ood.
- So the company... cuts off their brains?

27:26.374 --> 27:28.499
And they stitch on the translator.

27:28.534 --> 27:30.425
Like a lobotomy.

27:30.460 --> 27:34.464
I spent all that time
looking for you, Doctor,

27:34.499 --> 27:38.260
because I thought it would be
so wonderful out here.

27:39.779 --> 27:42.020
I want to go home.

27:46.060 --> 27:50.860
- They're with the Ood, sir.
- What you gonna do, then? Arrest me?

27:50.895 --> 27:55.137
Lock me up? Throw me in a cage?
Well, you're too late! Hah!

27:55.172 --> 27:58.125
Why don't you just come out
and say it? FOTO activists!

27:58.160 --> 28:01.079
If that's what Friends Of The Ood
are trying to prove, yes!

28:01.080 --> 28:03.080
The Ood were nothing without us,

28:03.279 --> 28:06.499
- just animals roaming on the ice.
- That's because you can't hear them.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.000
They welcomed it!

28:08.299 --> 28:11.065
- It's not as if they put up a fight.
- You idiot!

28:11.100 --> 28:14.900
They're born with their brains
in their hands, don't you see?

28:14.935 --> 28:18.304
That makes them peaceful,
they've got to be,

28:18.339 --> 28:19.820
cos a creature like that
would have to trust anyone it meets.

28:19.821 --> 28:22.321
- Oh, nice one.
- Thank you!

28:22.420 --> 28:26.219
The system's worked for 200 years.
All we've got is a rogue batch.

28:26.254 --> 28:31.019
But the infection is about
to be sterilised. Mr. Kess?

28:31.054 --> 28:34.985
- How do we stand?
- Canisters primed, sir.

28:35.020 --> 28:38.420
As soon as the core heats up,
the gas is released.

28:38.455 --> 28:42.264
Give it 200 marks...
and counting.

28:42.299 --> 28:45.184
- You're gonna gas them?!
- Kill the livestock.

28:45.219 --> 28:48.260
The classic foot-and-mouth solution
from the olden days.

28:48.295 --> 28:49.580
Still works.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.939
I'm sorry, if I could ask you one
more time, could all the Reps please

29:08.974 --> 29:09.859
come through to the
Education Suites.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.960
Why move now?
It's a free bar!

29:13.059 --> 29:17.620
Could I ask all the Ood
to withdraw, it's feeding time.

29:17.655 --> 29:21.785
Aw! You've upset them.
Leave them alone!

29:21.820 --> 29:24.779
I have to insist.
If all the Ood could please leave...

29:35.579 --> 29:36.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
change of plan.

29:36.801 --> 29:39.401
If you could leave
by the fire exits.

29:41.660 --> 29:44.180
I could sell this!
You could offer different colours.

29:44.215 --> 29:45.620
Aaargh!

29:54.499 --> 29:55.660
Aargh!

29:56.860 --> 29:58.179
Aargh!

30:00.968 --> 30:03.260
They've gone insane, Miss,
they've gone mad, all of them!

30:03.295 --> 30:07.100
Just shoot them! Shoot to kill!

30:20.777 --> 30:22.060
What the hell?

30:24.140 --> 30:26.140
What's going on out there?

30:33.140 --> 30:37.780
<i>Emergency status. Emergency status.
All exits sealed.</i>

30:47.659 --> 30:50.060
It's a revolution.

31:00.739 --> 31:03.459
Come back! Let me out of here!

31:06.539 --> 31:09.019
Aargh!

31:11.879 --> 31:13.064
Change of plan.

31:13.379 --> 31:17.477
No reports of trouble off-world, sir,
it's still contained to the Ood-Sphere.

31:17.512 --> 31:19.982
Then we've got a public duty to stop it before it spreads.

31:19.983 --> 31:20.800
What's happening?

31:20.820 --> 31:25.140
Everything you wanted, Doctor. No doubt
there'll be a full police investigation once this place

31:25.175 --> 31:27.280
has been sterilised, so I can't risk
a bullet to the head.

31:28.381 --> 31:30.381
I'll leave you to the
mercies of the Ood.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.480
But Mr. Halpen, there's something else, isn't
there? Something we haven't seen!

31:33.481 --> 31:34.481
What d'you mean?

31:34.580 --> 31:37.319
A creature couldn't survive with a separate fore
brain and hind brain, they'd be at war with themselves,

31:37.354 --> 31:39.320
there's got to be something else,
a third element. Am I right?

31:39.321 --> 31:42.821
- And again, so clever!
- But it's got to be connected to the red-eye, what is it?

31:44.220 --> 31:47.459
"It" won't exist
for very much longer.

31:47.494 --> 31:49.780
Enjoy your Ood.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.259
Come on!

32:00.340 --> 32:03.859
- Dr. Ryder. Warehouse 15.
- Well, what about THIS one?

32:03.894 --> 32:08.300
No. You've not turned.
Faithful to the last.

32:09.499 --> 32:13.340
Go, join your people,
while you still can.

32:19.259 --> 32:20.539
Come on.

32:26.339 --> 32:29.505
Well, do something!
You're the one with all the tricks!

32:29.540 --> 32:33.620
- You must've met Houdini!
- These are really good handcuffs!

32:33.655 --> 32:35.744
Oh, well I'm glad of that

32:35.779 --> 32:38.020
I mean, at least
we've got quality

32:54.539 --> 32:59.219
Doctor, Donna, friends. The circle must be broken.
Doctor, Donna, friends! The circle must be broken!

32:59.254 --> 33:03.899
Doctor, Donna, friends! The circle must be broken!
Friends, friends, friends! The circle must be broken!

33:03.934 --> 33:08.980
Doctor, Donna, friends! The circle must
be broken! Friends, friends, friends!

33:09.015 --> 33:12.460
Doctor, Donna, friends!

33:14.979 --> 33:17.780
Friends! The circle must...!

33:32.739 --> 33:36.384
Doctor. Donna. Friends.

33:36.419 --> 33:40.259
- Yes! That's us! Friends! Oh, yes!
- That's me! That's us!

33:42.899 --> 33:45.659
No! Leave him.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.459
I don't know where it is!
I don't know where they've gone!

33:56.494 --> 33:59.145
What are we looking for?

33:59.180 --> 34:04.019
Might be underground, like some
sort of cave, or a cavern, or...

34:11.699 --> 34:14.219
<i>Warehouse 15. Door open.</i>

34:22.299 --> 34:24.219
All right?

34:30.420 --> 34:34.264
It's always been an option,
my grandfather drew up this plan.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.899
That's the advantage of a family-run business,
Dr. Ryder. The personal touch.

34:37.900 --> 34:38.900
But we should evacuate.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.980
- If we can get to the rocket sheds...
- No need! We've got this.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.978
Detonation packs.
Place them around the circumference.

34:52.018 --> 34:54.705
We're gonna blow it up.

34:54.739 --> 34:58.459
This thing dies, so do the Ood.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.700
The Ood Brain.

35:29.780 --> 35:34.060
Now it all makes sense, that's the
missing link, the third element,

35:34.095 --> 35:38.180
binding them together.
Fore brain, hind brain, and this -

35:38.215 --> 35:41.025
the telepathic centre.

35:41.060 --> 35:46.340
It's a shared mind,
connecting all the Ood in song.

35:48.100 --> 35:51.665
Cargo. I can always go into cargo.

35:51.700 --> 35:58.499
I've got the rockets, I've got the sheds. Smaller
business, much more manageable, without livestock.

35:58.534 --> 36:01.304
- He's mined the area.
- They're gonna kill it?

36:01.339 --> 36:05.079
They found that... thing centuries
ago beneath the Northern Glacier.

36:05.579 --> 36:08.240
- Those pylons.
- In a circle.

36:08.941 --> 36:12.041
- "The circle must be broken."
- Damping the telepathic field.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.665
Stopping the Ood from connecting
for 200 years.

36:15.700 --> 36:19.955
And you, Ood Sigma, you brought
them here. I expected better.

36:19.956 --> 36:22.318
My place is at your side, sir.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.619
Ha-ha! Still subservient.

36:25.654 --> 36:27.665
Good Ood.

36:27.700 --> 36:31.499
If that barrier thing's in place,
how come the Ood started breaking out?

36:31.534 --> 36:35.780
Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt.
The subconscious reaching out.

36:35.815 --> 36:39.945
But the process was too slow.
Had to be accelerated.

36:39.980 --> 36:45.260
You should never have given me access to the controls,
Mr. Halpen. I lowered the barrier to its minimum.

36:45.295 --> 36:47.864
Friends Of The Ood, sir.

36:47.899 --> 36:51.700
It's taken me ten years
to infiltrate the company.

36:51.735 --> 36:54.757
And I succeeded.

36:54.792 --> 36:57.780
Yes. Yes, you did.

36:59.579 --> 37:02.179
Aargh!

37:14.019 --> 37:16.459
You... murdered him!

37:16.494 --> 37:18.899
Very observant, Ginger.

37:19.332 --> 37:20.713
Now, then...

37:22.619 --> 37:25.659
can't say I've ever shot
anyone before.

37:25.694 --> 37:27.785
Can't say I'm gonna like it.

37:27.820 --> 37:33.580
But it's not exactly a normal day,
is it? Still...

37:33.615 --> 37:36.384
Would you like a drink, sir?

37:36.419 --> 37:39.825
I think hair loss is the least
of my problems right now, thanks.

37:39.860 --> 37:45.620
- Please have a drink, sir.
- If... If you're going to stand in their way,

37:45.655 --> 37:48.264
I'll shoot you too.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.219
Please have a drink, sir.

37:52.899 --> 37:56.665
Have... Have you... poisoned me?

37:56.700 --> 38:00.899
- Natural Ood must never kill, sir.
- What is that stuff?

38:00.934 --> 38:03.540
Ood-graft suspended
in a biological compound, sir.

38:03.541 --> 38:05.141
What the hell does THAT mean?!

38:05.340 --> 38:08.224
- Oh, dear...
- Tell me!

38:08.259 --> 38:12.659
Funny thing, the subconscious.
Takes all sorts of shapes.

38:12.694 --> 38:13.800
It came out in the
red-eye as revenge.

38:13.801 --> 38:16.001
Came out in the rabid Ood as anger.

38:16.300 --> 38:19.499
And then there was patience.

38:20.539 --> 38:26.019
All that intelligence and mercy,
focused on Ood Sigma.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.820
How's that hair loss, Mr. Halpen?

38:34.299 --> 38:36.785
What have you done?

38:36.820 --> 38:41.024
Oh, they've been preparing you for a
very long time.

38:41.059 --> 38:45.419
Now you're standing next to the Ood
Brain. Mr. Halpen, can you hear it?

38:45.454 --> 38:46.939
Listen...

38:52.019 --> 38:54.799
What have you...?

38:54.834 --> 38:57.580
I'm... not...!

39:33.418 --> 39:38.659
They... They turned him
into an Ood?!

39:41.020 --> 39:42.739
He's an Ood.

39:42.774 --> 39:44.459
I noticed.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.584
He has become Oodkind.

39:55.619 --> 39:57.620
And we will take care of him.

40:00.980 --> 40:05.060
It's weird, being with you, I can't tell
what's right and what's wrong any more.

40:05.095 --> 40:06.059
It's better that way.

40:06.060 --> 40:08.860
People who know for certain
tend to be like Mr. Halpen.

40:09.059 --> 40:11.505
Ooh!

40:11.540 --> 40:14.025
That's better. And now...

40:14.060 --> 40:17.319
Sigma, would you allow me the honour?

40:17.354 --> 40:20.579
- It is yours, Doctor.
- Oh, yes!

40:20.614 --> 40:22.385
Stifled for 200 years.

40:22.420 --> 40:27.099
But not any more. The circle
is broken, the Ood can sing.

40:37.859 --> 40:39.299
I can hear it!

41:14.420 --> 41:16.745
The message has gone out.

41:16.780 --> 41:19.799
That song resonated across the
galaxies, everyone heard it.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.070
Everyone knows.

41:23.055 --> 41:25.300
The rockets are bringing them back,

41:25.335 --> 41:27.637
the Ood are coming home.

41:27.672 --> 41:29.940
We thank you, Doctor-Donna.

41:29.975 --> 41:31.544
Friends of Oodkind.

41:31.579 --> 41:33.899
And what of you now, will you stay?

41:33.934 --> 41:36.220
There is room in the song for you.

41:36.255 --> 41:37.824
Oh, I've...

41:37.859 --> 41:40.259
sort of got a song of my own, thanks.

41:40.294 --> 41:44.036
I think your song must end soon.

41:44.071 --> 41:47.779
- Meaning?
- Every song must end.

41:47.814 --> 41:49.745
Yeah.

41:49.780 --> 41:52.384
Erm, what about you?

41:52.419 --> 41:54.780
- You still want to go home?
- No.

41:54.815 --> 41:56.267
Definitely not.

41:56.302 --> 41:57.720
Then, we'll be off.

41:57.721 --> 42:00.221
- Take this song with you.
- We will.

42:01.220 --> 42:02.825
Always.

42:02.860 --> 42:06.340
And know this, Doctor-Donna.
You will never be forgotten.

42:06.375 --> 42:09.224
Our children will sing
of the Doctor-Donna,

42:09.259 --> 42:16.059
and our children's children, and the wind and the
ice and the snow will carry your names, forever.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.724
Doctor, it's Martha,

42:36.759 --> 42:39.245
and I'm bringing you back to Earth.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.999
Yesterday 52 people died
in identical circumstances,

42:42.034 --> 42:44.719
right across the world
in 11 different time zones.

42:44.754 --> 42:46.404
And you think ATMOS is alien?

42:46.439 --> 42:48.645
It's our job to investigate
that possibility.

42:48.680 --> 42:52.480
- Who are you?
- I am General Staal of the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet.

42:52.515 --> 42:55.557
- We have an intruder!
- Operation Blue Sky is go go go!

42:55.592 --> 42:58.600
Is that what you did to her?
Turn her into a soldier?

42:58.635 --> 43:01.125
- What is that?!
- Sontaron!

43:01.160 --> 43:03.439
Stare into the face of death!
