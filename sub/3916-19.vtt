Cort, this is... this is
Callie, my... my sister.

00:04.387 --> 00:05.386
She's the girl you loved

00:05.388 --> 00:07.355
and couldn't be with for some reason.

00:07.390 --> 00:09.557
Jude: Do you ever think that maybe
the only reason why we got together

00:09.559 --> 00:12.393
was because we were the only
two gay boys in our grade?

00:12.395 --> 00:13.444
<i>We were friends first.</i>

00:13.480 --> 00:14.862
You don't feel like my friend anymore.

00:14.964 --> 00:16.164
Adriana: Why don't you date Ana?

00:16.199 --> 00:18.366
You guys would be so cute together.

00:18.401 --> 00:20.368
- Wait, you're bleeding.
- Let me see.

00:20.403 --> 00:21.186
If I let them take me out of this home,

00:21.238 --> 00:23.371
they're just gonna put me in another one.

00:23.406 --> 00:25.373
If you're ever not feeling this,

00:25.408 --> 00:26.791
then just be honest with me.

00:26.843 --> 00:29.460
Brandon: <i>I finally believed you
guys were desperately in love.</i>

00:32.515 --> 00:34.415
Well, guys, we made it.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.416
Opening night.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.385
Mat and I couldn't have
done it without you.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.586
Actor: Well, that's true.

00:38.638 --> 00:40.555
And now we get to, uh, just
coast for the rest of the year

00:40.590 --> 00:42.557
'cause our senior project is done.

00:42.592 --> 00:44.425
(laughter)

00:44.477 --> 00:47.428
Screw you. I still got a
dumb-ass paper to write.

Brandon: Although, I... I
guess it only, uh, matters

00:50.433 --> 00:52.400
if you go to Anchor Beach.

00:52.435 --> 00:53.518
You know, I wish I would have

00:53.570 --> 00:54.569
thought of this when I was a senior.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.691
All right, well, thank
you all for being here

00:58.693 --> 01:00.576
and making this possible.

01:00.612 --> 01:02.528
Yeah, you owe me big time.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.530
- Uh, yeah he does!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.422

01:13.458 --> 01:15.374
All: Unbreakable!

01:15.426 --> 01:16.542

01:37.562 --> 01:38.694

01:38.730 --> 01:40.696

had just told their parents...

27:09.167 --> 27:10.983
Be gone from Verona!

27:11.019 --> 27:12.051
- Paris will doom thee to death.
- Nay!

27:12.086 --> 27:15.821
Benvolia: Be gone! Away!

27:16.974 --> 27:18.741
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:20.261 --> 27:22.862
Uh, I...

27:22.897 --> 27:24.146
I think, uh...

27:27.135 --> 27:28.234
I think I did something stupid.

27:28.269 --> 27:30.036
What?

27:31.072 --> 27:32.071
I kissed Jude.

27:33.975 --> 27:35.041
Well, why is that stupid?

27:35.076 --> 27:36.876
I mean, do you like him?

27:37.945 --> 27:39.845
Y... yeah, I... I do,

27:39.881 --> 27:41.147
but as a friend.

27:41.182 --> 27:43.149
I... I... I'm not gay.

27:45.119 --> 27:46.085
So why did you kiss him?

27:47.121 --> 27:49.088
He was just so... so upset about Connor,

27:49.123 --> 27:50.990
and I... I wanted to make him feel better.

27:56.864 --> 27:58.764
Well, then you have to tell him the truth.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.100
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.

28:07.533 --> 28:09.433
Romeo that killed him, he is banished.

28:09.468 --> 28:11.568
Paris shall not make me a joyful bride.

28:11.694 --> 28:13.627
Hold then.

28:13.662 --> 28:15.462
Go home, be merry,

28:15.498 --> 28:16.864
consent to marry Paris.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.868
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

28:20.903 --> 28:23.737
and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

28:23.772 --> 28:26.640
When presently through all
thy veins shall run no pulse

28:26.675 --> 28:28.675
the roses in thy lips
and cheeks shall fade

28:28.711 --> 28:30.677
and in this borrowed
likeness of shrunk death,

28:30.713 --> 28:33.614
thou shall continue two and forty hours,

28:33.649 --> 28:36.817
and then awake as from pleasant sleep.

28:36.852 --> 28:39.753
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.755
shall Romeo by my letters

28:41.790 --> 28:45.626
know our drift and hither
shall he come to save you.

28:48.664 --> 28:51.632
Love, give me strength...

28:51.667 --> 28:53.600
and strength shall help afford.

28:55.504 --> 28:56.470
Farewell, dear Friar.

29:05.814 --> 29:08.582
Methought we had more time?

29:08.617 --> 29:09.716

I'm not...

30:48.550 --> 30:50.951

30:50.986 --> 30:53.887
I realized I... I can get over him.

30:53.922 --> 30:56.790
And, you know, maybe there's
someone else out there.

30:59.795 --> 31:01.561
Oh, you forgot something.

31:03.532 --> 31:04.665
It's a pay-as-you-go phone.

31:04.700 --> 31:05.632
I had my moms get it

31:05.668 --> 31:07.451
and charge it with a ton of minutes.

31:07.486 --> 31:09.836
- Jude, I can't take...
- And whenever you run out,

31:09.872 --> 31:11.872
I will use my allowance
to buy you more time.

31:11.907 --> 31:13.940
