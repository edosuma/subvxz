00:27.171 --> 00:28.772
I never wanna grow old.

00:33.919 --> 00:34.888
I don't wanna die.

00:36.121 --> 00:37.289
I'm too young to die.

00:41.027 --> 00:43.331
I cannot watch my body grow old,

00:44.276 --> 00:45.478
lose control over it,

00:47.033 --> 00:49.168
watch it crumble
away before my eyes.

00:52.508 --> 00:53.343
I can't stop.

00:57.286 --> 01:02.258
I need more.

01:33.897 --> 01:36.647
Truth is, older
men are more interesting

01:36.649 --> 01:37.614
because they have enough money

01:37.616 --> 01:40.864
not to have to wait around
all night for a bus.

01:40.866 --> 01:44.794
Truth is older men are
simply better in bed.

01:51.606 --> 01:53.809
And who are all
these older men?

02:19.379 --> 02:21.143
Thank you, mate.

02:22.352 --> 02:23.733
Nice Neighborhood.

02:23.735 --> 02:26.238
Right next to the express way.

02:27.152 --> 02:30.578
Seriously, I mean who
names their child Light?

02:31.872 --> 02:33.773
Well, I like the name Kira.

02:33.775 --> 02:36.409
You'd say anything
to get me into your apartment.

02:36.411 --> 02:38.444
Hey, not true.

02:38.446 --> 02:39.313
No, it is true.

02:40.348 --> 02:41.848
But you have to admit

02:43.250 --> 02:45.817
Kira Mabon does
sound pretty cool.

02:45.819 --> 02:47.652
It does,
but it's Mabon.

02:47.654 --> 02:50.190
Not nearly as
distinguished as Mabon.

02:51.491 --> 02:52.924
Okay, we will
see what we can do

02:52.926 --> 02:54.894
with that last name
of yours, shall we?

02:56.695 --> 02:57.628
Wait, wait, wait.

02:57.630 --> 02:58.430
Let me turn on the lights.

02:58.432 --> 02:59.366
Scare away the rats.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.336
Great, great.

03:06.472 --> 03:08.005
You know, I thought
after three years

03:08.007 --> 03:10.307
the landlord would have
managed to fix the switch.

03:10.309 --> 03:11.243
I got this.

03:17.615 --> 03:20.016
You're not gonna...

03:20.018 --> 03:21.452
Not bad.

03:21.454 --> 03:22.818
Not bad at all.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.520
Took me
like six months

03:24.522 --> 03:25.888
to figure out that
trick with the fuse.

03:26.825 --> 03:29.425
So, where do we go from here?

03:29.427 --> 03:32.228
Well, if you know
how to turn on the lights,

03:32.230 --> 03:34.199
then the rest of the place
should be a piece of cake.

03:37.935 --> 03:39.636
Okay, and now...

03:48.312 --> 03:49.910
To your left,

03:49.912 --> 03:51.312
The kitchen.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.515
Beginner's luck.

03:53.517 --> 03:57.051
And here we have
your favorite picture,

03:57.053 --> 03:59.455
despite the tear on the
lower left hand corner.

04:11.933 --> 04:14.202
To my right, shithouse.

04:15.438 --> 04:17.504
Wow, nice.

05:37.481 --> 05:38.316
Jonas?

05:39.983 --> 05:41.617
Jonas?

05:41.619 --> 05:43.051
Where are you?

05:43.053 --> 05:45.022
You men have it so easy.

05:46.189 --> 05:49.324
Men get cooler, more
interesting as they age

05:49.326 --> 05:50.994
and women just
start to look old.

05:52.396 --> 05:54.730
Oh, the world's so unfair.

05:58.902 --> 06:01.636
I mean, it was our
fifth date, already!

06:01.638 --> 06:04.106
And here I was, thinking
he was unique, you know?

06:05.375 --> 06:06.509
I'm on my way home now.

06:08.177 --> 06:10.712
Of course I spent the
night at his place.

06:10.714 --> 06:11.979
Why wouldn't I?

06:11.981 --> 06:13.515
No, really, he was.

06:16.652 --> 06:19.620
What?

06:19.622 --> 06:21.954
Why would I make up
something like that?

06:21.956 --> 06:22.888
Wait until you meet him.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.627
He's a really, hello, Martha?

06:27.162 --> 06:28.296
She hung up on me.

06:43.043 --> 06:45.045
How did I get back here?

06:54.021 --> 06:55.553
Nice neighborhood.

06:55.555 --> 06:57.056
Right next to the express way.

07:20.246 --> 07:23.845
You'd say anything to get
me into your apartment.

07:26.217 --> 07:27.651
Let me
turn on the lights.

07:27.653 --> 07:29.320
Scare away the rats.

07:39.997 --> 07:41.497
You know, I thought
after three years

07:41.499 --> 07:43.367
the landlord would have
managed to fix the switch.

08:04.853 --> 08:06.520
Your favorite picture,

08:06.522 --> 08:10.459
despite the tear on the
lower left hand corner.

08:24.406 --> 08:27.374
Kira Mabon
does sound pretty cool.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.676
It does but it's Mabon.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.176
You
have reached a number

09:06.178 --> 09:07.077
that has been
disconnected or is no...

09:24.062 --> 09:25.262
You've reached the home of K...

09:39.209 --> 09:41.444
You've reached the
home of Kira Mabon.

09:41.446 --> 09:44.580
Please leave a message
and I shall call you back.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.081
Hello?

09:55.158 --> 09:56.090
Mommy?

12:09.953 --> 12:11.217
Just go away.

12:12.822 --> 12:13.623
Ahh.

12:16.259 --> 12:19.326
Martha: Kira?

12:19.328 --> 12:21.028
Hello, is anyone home?

12:21.030 --> 12:21.764
Martha.

12:25.867 --> 12:26.702
Martha.

12:30.504 --> 12:31.339
Martha?

12:34.476 --> 12:36.042
Salut!

12:36.044 --> 12:36.878
Hey!

12:41.549 --> 12:43.583
Everything okay?

12:43.585 --> 12:44.750
Yeah, I...

12:49.390 --> 12:50.224
Do I know you?

12:51.491 --> 12:52.559
I'm Sophia.

12:54.795 --> 12:55.628
Hi.

12:55.630 --> 12:56.528
Hey.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.500
Some tea?

13:01.401 --> 13:02.202
Please.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.274
Uh,

13:09.242 --> 13:10.510
have you lived here long?

13:11.510 --> 13:12.912
About half a year.

13:14.446 --> 13:17.280
It was a bitch getting
my stuff up those stairs.

13:17.282 --> 13:18.682
Oh.

13:18.684 --> 13:19.551
You okay?

13:22.321 --> 13:24.956
We don't clean
up the fridge, do we?

13:24.958 --> 13:27.126
I'll just throw it away, okay?

13:37.503 --> 13:39.135
Did I uh,

13:39.137 --> 13:41.003
bump my head when I fell?

13:41.005 --> 13:42.204
No.

13:42.206 --> 13:43.108
I was there.

13:44.275 --> 13:45.640
Caught you.

13:45.642 --> 13:46.811
I was amazing.

13:50.915 --> 13:52.847
You're kind of...

13:52.849 --> 13:55.385
Dizzy, strange,
tired, thirsty,

13:57.387 --> 13:58.221
horny?

14:03.193 --> 14:04.693
Useless knowledge fact,

14:04.695 --> 14:07.962
most people, when they wake
up from fainting or whatever,

14:07.964 --> 14:09.196
are aroused.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.700
It's like boys and
their morning wood.

14:12.969 --> 14:13.801
Really?

14:13.803 --> 14:14.637
Totally.

14:16.572 --> 14:17.373
Oh!

14:22.745 --> 14:24.545
I'm so glad
to finally meet you.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.716
I always wondered who
was living next door.

14:31.252 --> 14:33.120
Green tea, right?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.587
Yes!

14:34.589 --> 14:35.555
How did you know?

14:35.557 --> 14:36.858
How did I know?

14:40.029 --> 14:41.293
How did I know?

14:43.832 --> 14:44.699
Truth is,

14:48.103 --> 14:48.937
I'm psychic.

14:51.139 --> 14:52.040
Seriously?

14:56.944 --> 14:58.078
Come on, test me.

14:59.813 --> 15:00.647
Okay.

15:02.850 --> 15:07.185
What is my favorite color?

15:07.187 --> 15:08.020
Red.

15:09.522 --> 15:11.255
My favorite
musical instrument?

15:11.257 --> 15:12.092
The piano.

15:14.228 --> 15:15.760
How did you know?

15:17.864 --> 15:19.497
I'm sorry.

15:19.499 --> 15:21.631
No honestly, I'm sorry.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.100
But you should have seen
the look on your face.

15:23.102 --> 15:24.369
It's standing over there.

15:25.938 --> 15:29.339
Right, I play professionally.

15:29.341 --> 15:31.708
Hmmm.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.944
One can live off of that?

15:33.946 --> 15:34.747
Apparently.

15:36.514 --> 15:38.515
And yourself?

15:38.517 --> 15:41.252
I'm studying Chinese
linguistics and literature.

15:41.254 --> 15:42.518
To be an interpreter, or...

15:42.520 --> 15:46.158
No, no, interpreting
is way too stressful.

15:47.324 --> 15:50.194
I'd rather be a cultural
attache or something.

15:51.595 --> 15:54.830
You know, big villa in Beijing

15:54.832 --> 15:58.133
and tons of cute little
Chinese servant girls.

15:58.135 --> 15:59.300
With martinis.

15:59.302 --> 16:00.169
Oh.

16:00.171 --> 16:01.336
Ideally, yes.

16:06.476 --> 16:08.576
May I
ask you something?

16:08.578 --> 16:09.412
Fire away.

16:11.681 --> 16:12.682
Do you know Jonas?

16:15.252 --> 16:16.086
Jonas?

16:17.887 --> 16:18.721
Yes.

16:21.591 --> 16:24.960
The man who lives here.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.295
But you live here?

16:27.297 --> 16:28.131
Excuse me.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.575
Are you
feeling all right?

16:41.577 --> 16:42.843
I mean, seriously.

16:42.845 --> 16:44.679
You've been living
here like forever.

16:47.481 --> 16:48.649
Here.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.952
Never
seen him before.

16:52.954 --> 16:54.987
Your boyfriend?

16:54.989 --> 16:56.325
Or ex?

16:57.490 --> 16:59.824
That doesn't look
like a recent photo.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.060
You've never seen him?

17:01.062 --> 17:02.864
Not in
the last few months.

17:05.464 --> 17:06.964
What about me?

17:06.967 --> 17:11.069
Hey, maybe you
did hit your head back there

17:11.071 --> 17:12.837
and I didn't see it.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.339
Or did it happen before I came?

17:15.342 --> 17:16.309
What was going on?

17:21.413 --> 17:22.647
What's up with your hand?

17:32.124 --> 17:33.290
Wow,

17:33.292 --> 17:34.827
that looks shitty.

17:40.064 --> 17:41.430
Hey.

17:41.432 --> 17:42.832
Hey, hey.

17:42.834 --> 17:43.768
Hey, come here, come here.

17:46.237 --> 17:47.637
You need to relax,

17:47.639 --> 17:49.538
maybe take a bath.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.875
I'll come by tonight, okay?

17:51.876 --> 17:53.344
I never wanna be like that,

17:56.014 --> 17:57.647
abandoned or so old

17:57.649 --> 17:59.950
that I have to live
in a retirement home.

18:01.418 --> 18:02.253
Old.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.930
Hello?

19:01.842 --> 19:02.943
No.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.489
Don't take this the wrong way,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.359
but you're having blackouts

19:20.361 --> 19:22.326
and the feeling that
time is rushing by

19:22.328 --> 19:24.428
and your finger,

19:24.430 --> 19:26.864
your fingers really
don't look good.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.032
You don't have to see a shrink,

19:29.034 --> 19:31.735
but a doctor might
be a good idea.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.038
I did find a doctor's note.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.074
But I can't remember
making the appointment.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.542
That might be a
good place to start.

19:39.544 --> 19:42.012
Maybe it's just a nervous
reaction or an allergy.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.748
Those go away after
a while, right?

19:46.485 --> 19:48.388
How many days has
it been like this?

19:49.587 --> 19:50.688
I don't know.

19:51.989 --> 19:53.689
Do you think it'll spread?

19:53.691 --> 19:55.058
I don't know.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.524
That's what a doctor's for, no?

20:00.564 --> 20:02.500
You know, you've
been so good to me.

20:05.169 --> 20:06.001
Sante!

20:07.104 --> 20:08.737
Oh shit.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.673
Ah, my foot!

20:11.574 --> 20:12.408
Fuck!

20:12.410 --> 20:13.342
Sorry.

20:13.344 --> 20:14.609
Don't be, don't be.

20:14.611 --> 20:16.576
Just a piece of glass

20:16.578 --> 20:17.945
It was an accident.

20:17.947 --> 20:18.782
Some skin.

20:53.181 --> 20:54.013
Hey.

20:54.015 --> 20:55.116
Are you okay?

20:56.818 --> 20:57.617
Yeah.

21:00.687 --> 21:02.254
Kira?

21:02.256 --> 21:03.057
Yeah?

21:05.326 --> 21:07.926
Do you need a band
aid or something?

21:14.502 --> 21:17.669
Do you think you might be
able to stay here tonight?

21:17.671 --> 21:20.207
I really don't want
to be left alone.

21:58.109 --> 21:58.942
Kira?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.514
I'm in here.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.119
Wow, I
slept like a rock.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.024
Mornin', sunshine.

22:15.192 --> 22:16.260
Good morning.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.395
You all right?

22:19.329 --> 22:20.129
Yes.

22:21.664 --> 22:23.931
That doesn't look
all right to me.

22:24.867 --> 22:25.799
It looks worse than it is.

22:25.801 --> 22:27.535
I just put some cream on it.

22:27.537 --> 22:28.969
Can I take a shower here?

22:28.971 --> 22:30.673
They still haven't
fixed my drain.

22:31.874 --> 22:32.875
Yeah, sure.

22:33.775 --> 22:34.707
Be my guest.

22:34.709 --> 22:35.877
The towels are over there.

22:37.113 --> 22:38.915
Don't forget to
call the doctor.

22:48.623 --> 22:50.725
Thanks again for staying here.

22:52.628 --> 22:55.495
Yes, hello, I had an
appointment three days ago,

22:55.497 --> 22:58.133
but I'm afraid
that I missed the...

23:00.634 --> 23:01.535
Kira Mabon.

23:04.472 --> 23:09.476
I was?

23:28.294 --> 23:29.527
Ms. Mabon?

23:29.529 --> 23:32.699
We're pleased that you
could come immediately.

23:40.806 --> 23:42.539
I know this probably
sounds extremely strange,

23:42.541 --> 23:44.409
but have we met before?

23:47.045 --> 23:49.248
Experiencing
short-term memory loss?

23:50.415 --> 23:52.317
I wouldn't worry
about that right now.

23:57.589 --> 24:01.123
The analysis of the
skin on your hand

24:01.125 --> 24:04.159
shows there is an
atypical deterioration

24:04.161 --> 24:05.361
of the cell structure.

24:05.363 --> 24:08.130
I'm sorry, what does
that mean exactly?

24:08.132 --> 24:09.632
You see,

24:09.634 --> 24:14.270
each cell of the human body
renews itself again and again.

24:14.272 --> 24:15.706
Old cells are discarded.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.409
Dandruff on your scalp
is a good example.

24:20.777 --> 24:25.315
As the body ages, the
cellular structure breaks down

24:26.416 --> 24:28.883
and the ability to
build new cells lessens.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.951
But I only have
this on my hand?

24:30.953 --> 24:32.986
Aside from which you are

24:32.988 --> 24:33.956
far too young.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.059
Right.

24:39.128 --> 24:42.229
The outer layer of
your skin is aging

24:42.231 --> 24:46.435
and dying at an extreme rate.

24:48.170 --> 24:51.003
The underlining layer however
is still perfectly healthy.

24:51.005 --> 24:53.440
Can't skin be transplanted?

24:53.442 --> 24:54.874
Of course.

24:54.876 --> 24:58.110
But first we have to understand
the reason for the aging.

24:58.112 --> 25:00.046
If we were to
perform a transplant,

25:00.048 --> 25:01.480
the body might
reject the new skin.

25:01.482 --> 25:02.415
Yes, but in my case...

25:02.417 --> 25:03.882
Or, in your case, the new skin

25:03.884 --> 25:05.653
might undergo the same decline,

25:06.987 --> 25:11.156
unless we understand the
mechanism for the deterioration.

25:11.158 --> 25:15.695
Either that or the
underlining layer is incapable

25:15.697 --> 25:18.064
of accepting the new
tissue because...

25:21.234 --> 25:22.035
Well, that...

25:28.107 --> 25:30.110
It's adhering that quickly.

25:31.011 --> 25:31.977
That shouldn't...

25:33.079 --> 25:35.513
I don't think you
should do that anymore.

25:35.515 --> 25:38.015
Why don't we wait for the
test results to come back.

25:38.017 --> 25:39.650
That should be in
about 48 hours.

25:39.652 --> 25:42.152
In 48 hours, it could have
spread up my entire arm,

25:42.154 --> 25:43.854
or worse.

25:43.856 --> 25:46.222
I don't think that this dryness
will spread that rapidly.

25:46.224 --> 25:47.526
And what about the pain?

25:49.094 --> 25:50.296
How do I deal with that?

25:51.430 --> 25:53.064
I can give you
something for that.

25:54.232 --> 25:55.699
You can take this up
to three times a day,

25:55.701 --> 25:58.134
but it's very strong,
so no alcohol.

25:58.136 --> 26:00.737
Perhaps some of the
symptoms you describing

26:00.739 --> 26:02.438
are part of the healing process.

26:04.109 --> 26:04.943
We'll know soon enough.

26:06.176 --> 26:08.078
Have I been here before?

26:10.247 --> 26:11.781
Ms. Mabon, please,

26:11.783 --> 26:14.151
I have to prepare your tissue
and blood samples for the lab.

26:15.252 --> 26:16.186
But don't worry.

26:17.254 --> 26:18.590
We'll take care of this.

26:43.646 --> 26:45.179
Is this for you?

26:45.181 --> 26:46.679
Yes.

26:46.681 --> 26:48.581
Pardon me for saying,
but with all the products

26:48.583 --> 26:50.618
for cell rejuvenation
out on the market,

26:50.620 --> 26:53.121
you look like the last
person who would need them.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.522
Cell rejuvenation?

26:55.524 --> 26:57.058
I thought it was
just a pain killer?

26:59.027 --> 26:59.862
Okay.

28:30.947 --> 28:33.248
Kira Mabon?

28:33.250 --> 28:34.482
Mabon.

28:34.484 --> 28:35.987
Ah Mabon, Mabon.

28:37.686 --> 28:39.587
It's a bit crazy tonight.

28:39.589 --> 28:41.188
Like every night, really.

28:41.190 --> 28:43.490
You probably don't
really care, huh?

28:43.492 --> 28:45.094
Could you look at this for me?

28:46.595 --> 28:47.996
Yes.

28:47.998 --> 28:49.131
Can you sit over there?

29:08.216 --> 29:09.050
Fuck.

29:11.318 --> 29:12.250
Yesterday,

29:12.252 --> 29:16.087
when I woke up it was just here.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.656
It was a tiny speck

29:17.658 --> 29:18.492
and...

29:19.994 --> 29:21.829
Could a skin
transplant fix this?

29:23.363 --> 29:25.964
It's a pretty long
and difficult procedure,

29:25.966 --> 29:27.601
if it works at all.

29:28.769 --> 29:31.903
Wow, have you seen a
specialist about this?

29:31.905 --> 29:34.673
I talked to a Doctor Crober.

29:34.675 --> 29:36.510
She took samples of my skin

29:37.611 --> 29:39.543
and I have an
appointment with her

29:39.545 --> 29:41.046
the day after tomorrow.

29:41.048 --> 29:42.313
Good.

29:42.315 --> 29:44.181
Then they can decide if
a transplant makes sense

29:44.183 --> 29:47.720
and what sort of tissue would
be accepted by your body.

29:49.322 --> 29:51.388
God forbid they
do the transplant,

29:51.390 --> 29:54.190
then two weeks later
it all falls off.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.126
Very unpleasant.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.476
But it keeps getting larger.

30:14.712 --> 30:16.045
I'm really no specialist,

30:16.047 --> 30:19.081
but it all seems
pretty much localized.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.115
Plus it's just two days.

30:21.117 --> 30:23.821
You won't be looking
like the mummy by then.

32:40.183 --> 32:41.518
What the fuck?

32:48.759 --> 32:49.759
Holy mother.

32:51.060 --> 32:52.561
That's just nasty.

32:54.164 --> 32:54.997
Oh man.

33:05.207 --> 33:06.272
Hello?

33:06.274 --> 33:07.340
Is anyone back there?

33:07.342 --> 33:08.876
Hey you, stop!

33:08.878 --> 33:09.910
Stop!

33:09.912 --> 33:11.043
I said...

33:12.312 --> 33:14.180
Dispatch, send someone
to the service elevator

33:14.182 --> 33:15.882
at radiology.

33:15.884 --> 33:18.350
I said stop right fucking now!

33:18.352 --> 33:19.684
Stop!

33:19.686 --> 33:20.487
Ah, fuck!

33:22.190 --> 33:24.288
You have
reached the office

33:24.290 --> 33:25.258
of Doctor Crober.

33:25.260 --> 33:26.591
We are currently closed.

33:26.593 --> 33:28.227
Please, leave your
name and number.

33:30.131 --> 33:31.562
Hi, this is Kira Mabon.

33:31.564 --> 33:33.366
I was in earlier today.

33:34.501 --> 33:36.201
I really need to
talk to Dr. Crober.

33:36.203 --> 33:37.037
I...

33:49.348 --> 33:51.216
We are closing now.

33:51.218 --> 33:52.051
Hello?

33:53.085 --> 33:54.317
Ms. Mabon?

33:54.319 --> 33:55.553
It's Doctor Crober.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.654
How can I help you?

33:58.390 --> 34:00.191
I'm in pain, Doctor Crober.

34:00.193 --> 34:03.160
You need to have a little
respect for yourself, eh?

34:03.162 --> 34:05.195
I don't
know what to do.

34:05.197 --> 34:06.395
It won't go away

34:06.397 --> 34:08.300
and the dryness keeps
spreading rapidly.

34:11.503 --> 34:12.835
You must remain calm

34:12.837 --> 34:15.005
and try not to stress
yourself too much.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.274
The medication will take
some time to take effect.

34:18.275 --> 34:19.975
But you don't understand.

34:19.976 --> 34:24.112
I suggest you relax
and try to get some rest.

34:24.114 --> 34:26.248
I'll see you in the morning.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.617
That's the best I
can do right now.

34:28.619 --> 34:30.185
Do you think you can do that?

35:01.984 --> 35:04.820
Come on, you
can't be down here.

35:05.988 --> 35:09.224
If you wait upstairs,
I'll call you a cab.

35:10.125 --> 35:12.359
Don't try my patience.

35:19.001 --> 35:20.833
What the fu...

39:34.774 --> 39:37.744
Drugs, so
early in the morning?

39:39.746 --> 39:41.479
Doctor's orders.

39:41.481 --> 39:42.547
Ah.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.885
It's great to see you smile.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.155
And your hand is
doing way better.

39:50.157 --> 39:51.491
It's freaking amazing.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.927
What did the doctor give you?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.730
Or was she a voodoo priest?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.400
A little bit of both, I guess.

40:02.935 --> 40:03.869
So what was it?

40:05.304 --> 40:06.805
Tell me if I'm being too nosy.

40:07.907 --> 40:08.740
No.

40:09.707 --> 40:10.976
So, what was it?

40:12.178 --> 40:13.012
Scabies?

40:15.680 --> 40:16.979
She doesn't know.

40:16.981 --> 40:17.949
She doesn't know?

40:19.083 --> 40:19.884
Typical.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.011
Did your voodoo priest
conduct her ritual in the tub?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.419
Did it involve live chickens?

40:57.320 --> 40:58.120
Vomit?

41:03.159 --> 41:03.959
Hey.

41:08.965 --> 41:09.764
Hey.

41:13.302 --> 41:14.503
I was only kidding, okay?

41:38.225 --> 41:39.059
Tonight?

41:41.028 --> 41:41.862
Yeah.

41:56.744 --> 41:58.645
So, what
about the lab tests?

41:59.512 --> 42:01.412
Sensitive here?

42:01.414 --> 42:02.246
No, not at all.

42:02.248 --> 42:03.082
So?

42:04.150 --> 42:04.950
Indeterminate.

42:06.151 --> 42:07.518
I've ordered a new series.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.488
You can get dressed.

42:12.391 --> 42:15.127
You should continue taking
the meds until they run out.

42:16.596 --> 42:19.629
And I can write you
another prescription

42:19.631 --> 42:22.732
that should aid with
your current condition.

42:22.734 --> 42:24.167
Should?

42:24.169 --> 42:26.168
Well, unfortunately
there's never

42:26.170 --> 42:29.038
100% guarantee
with these things.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.274
That's why I want you in for
check-ups every other day.

42:32.276 --> 42:35.846
It's imperative that we
continue observations.

42:37.281 --> 42:40.382
I can have someone call you
prior to each appointment.

42:40.384 --> 42:41.319
Excuse me?

42:42.753 --> 42:45.354
The last time you were
here we talked about you

42:45.356 --> 42:48.325
experiencing some memory loss?

42:49.259 --> 42:50.093
We did?

42:54.464 --> 42:55.865
And you should be careful.

43:01.504 --> 43:02.770
We should keep an eye on this.

43:02.772 --> 43:05.406
You'll definitely have
to come back tomorrow.

43:05.408 --> 43:06.241
Of course.

43:10.447 --> 43:12.749
What if the dry spots
turn out to be a new one?

43:13.948 --> 43:16.016
Do you think it's
spreading again?

43:18.987 --> 43:21.087
Learning all the characters

43:21.089 --> 43:22.121
in the Chinese alphabet

43:22.123 --> 43:24.257
is completely impossible.

43:24.259 --> 43:25.759
There's like 3,000 of them...

43:25.761 --> 43:28.795
That's exactly how I felt
when I started reading music.

43:28.797 --> 43:31.999
Are there actually 250.000
different notes on your piano?

43:33.369 --> 43:35.368
I told you I was super smart.

43:35.370 --> 43:36.769
And now you have proof.

43:38.139 --> 43:39.472
More?

43:39.474 --> 43:40.306
Always.

43:40.308 --> 43:41.139
Bring it on.

43:41.141 --> 43:42.907
I meant more tomato?

43:42.909 --> 43:44.177
Oh, I see.

43:45.178 --> 43:46.345
Fuck if I care.

44:01.795 --> 44:03.327
Everything good?

44:03.329 --> 44:04.163
Mm-hmm.

44:04.997 --> 44:06.400
Just about ready.

44:07.833 --> 44:10.367
You never really told me
how the doc fixed your hand.

44:13.707 --> 44:15.106
It's not a secret, really.

44:15.974 --> 44:17.108
She gave me drugs.

44:19.211 --> 44:20.011
Drugs?

44:20.945 --> 44:21.746
Cool.

44:22.747 --> 44:23.980
Can I get an appointment?

44:25.785 --> 44:29.184
Seriously, she prescribed
something and it worked.

44:29.186 --> 44:30.455
It's gone entirely.

44:32.957 --> 44:34.860
What will you do
if it comes back?

44:38.363 --> 44:40.532
Could we talk
about something else?

44:41.699 --> 44:43.498
I'm just worried.

44:43.500 --> 44:44.334
It's just,

44:47.070 --> 44:49.338
it's all you've been
talking about all evening.

44:50.407 --> 44:51.406
If it disgusts you,

44:51.408 --> 44:53.844
or I disgust you, then

44:55.312 --> 44:56.512
what are you doing here?

44:58.147 --> 44:59.980
What?

44:59.982 --> 45:02.350
And if you've got something
to say, then just say it,

45:02.352 --> 45:03.983
because this
beating-around-the-bush thing

45:03.985 --> 45:06.055
is pretty much unbearable.

46:41.946 --> 46:44.848
Jonas, take your
girlfriend and get out.

46:44.850 --> 46:46.684
No, not again, please.

47:41.636 --> 47:43.037
Are you lost, honey?

47:58.285 --> 47:59.119
Busy?

49:35.911 --> 49:36.744
Kira.

49:37.846 --> 49:38.679
Hey, you.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.582
What are you doing out so late?

49:43.584 --> 49:45.317
Are you following me?

49:45.319 --> 49:46.186
Don't be silly.

49:46.188 --> 49:47.386
I just saw you.

49:47.388 --> 49:49.189
Thought maybe you
could use a ride home.

49:49.191 --> 49:50.523
Thanks, but I'll be okay.

49:51.759 --> 49:55.861
Listen, I'm really
sorry about last night.

49:55.863 --> 49:56.929
I didn't mean to pry, but...

49:56.931 --> 49:57.762
Please.

50:02.737 --> 50:05.403
What the hell is
going on back there?

50:05.405 --> 50:06.904
Must have been a
fight or something.

50:06.906 --> 50:09.242
Look, I just really need
to be alone right now, okay?

50:10.610 --> 50:11.443
Okay.

50:13.312 --> 50:15.682
You sure you don't
want that ride?

50:17.684 --> 50:19.251
Call me, all right?

50:33.065 --> 50:34.296
You should have
seen what happened

50:34.298 --> 50:36.735
when my father left my
mum for a younger woman.

50:37.569 --> 50:38.636
It destroyed us and

50:39.704 --> 50:41.372
my mother was so devastated.

50:43.307 --> 50:46.443
One day she told us she
had wasted her youth,

50:47.410 --> 50:49.113
broke off contact,

50:50.448 --> 50:52.282
decided to live her life now.

53:38.407 --> 53:39.241
Hey.

53:40.542 --> 53:42.144
Did you see the cops down there?

53:43.211 --> 53:44.143
Yeah.

53:44.145 --> 53:44.879
I ran into them on my way in.

53:47.682 --> 53:48.516
Missed you.

53:55.656 --> 53:57.358
Feel like making
me a cup of tea?

53:58.458 --> 53:59.825
Um,

53:59.827 --> 54:00.661
sure.

54:04.831 --> 54:07.199
So many great vinyls.

54:07.201 --> 54:08.069
Awesome.

54:48.706 --> 54:50.275
I'm sorry.

55:05.156 --> 55:06.221
What's that?

55:06.223 --> 55:07.290
Badly quoted Camus?

55:08.692 --> 55:10.326
I guess.

55:10.328 --> 55:13.263
It's kind of cheesy though.

55:15.499 --> 55:17.098
I like cheesy.

55:20.337 --> 55:24.872
You know, soap
supposedly works.

55:24.874 --> 55:25.708
What?

55:28.511 --> 55:31.612
Do you think you could
take a look at it for me?

55:31.614 --> 55:34.181
Yeah, for sure.

55:49.798 --> 55:52.365
You have
another dry spot.

55:52.367 --> 55:53.667
Like you had on your hand.

55:55.636 --> 55:56.471
Sorry.

55:57.704 --> 55:58.540
It's fine.

56:00.141 --> 56:00.974
Oh.

56:03.343 --> 56:04.477
More?

56:04.479 --> 56:05.380
It's really big.

56:06.947 --> 56:09.649
You're going to have to go
back and see the doc again.

56:17.191 --> 56:19.792
I'm sorry about the day before.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.895
It was really stupid.

56:24.297 --> 56:25.131
Me too.

56:37.876 --> 56:38.710
Too fast.

56:39.678 --> 56:40.677
Okay.

56:40.679 --> 56:41.578
Too fast.

56:41.580 --> 56:42.581
I'm sorry.

56:50.788 --> 56:52.021
You're right, Sophia.

56:52.023 --> 56:55.290
I have to go to the
doctor right away,

56:55.292 --> 56:56.460
to see Crober.

56:57.695 --> 56:59.094
Do you
want me to come?

56:59.096 --> 57:00.363
No.

57:00.365 --> 57:02.333
That's kind of you, but
I'd rather go by myself.

57:04.468 --> 57:05.302
Okay.

57:11.975 --> 57:14.709
See you this evening?

57:14.711 --> 57:15.712
I hope so.

58:43.095 --> 58:45.428
There is
no cause for despair.

58:45.430 --> 58:47.830
You don't have to face
watching your body decay.

58:47.832 --> 58:49.566
I wanted to wait
for the test results

58:49.568 --> 58:51.103
to come back before I told you.

58:52.503 --> 58:56.707
You recall that a transplant
is just one of several options?

58:56.709 --> 58:58.643
Did we talk
about a transplant?

58:59.776 --> 59:01.677
I believe we did, yes.

59:01.679 --> 59:03.745
The last time you were here.

59:03.747 --> 59:05.413
It's all in the file.

59:05.415 --> 59:08.149
We are going to continue
to address this problem

59:08.151 --> 59:09.487
on a cellular level.

59:10.421 --> 59:12.753
Not just by cutting it away.

59:12.755 --> 59:15.459
And I believe we found a cure.

59:16.860 --> 59:19.728
We will introduce cells
that have been reprogrammed

59:19.730 --> 59:23.665
in vitro, to induced
plural-ponent stem cells.

59:23.667 --> 59:26.634
They will rejuvenate the
afflicted cell structures

59:26.636 --> 59:27.868
in your body.

59:27.870 --> 59:29.837
It will greatly reduce
the epidermal decay

59:29.839 --> 59:32.740
and eventually, turn
it around completely.

59:32.742 --> 59:34.074
That's amazing.

59:34.076 --> 59:35.876
When can we begin?

59:35.878 --> 59:38.812
I need a few more days for
more thorough investigation,

59:38.814 --> 59:40.113
before we start in
a new treatment.

59:40.115 --> 59:41.548
I don't have a few more days.

59:41.550 --> 59:43.116
I need help now.

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:20.110
Kira?

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:26.114
Is everything okay?

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.181
Kira?

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.527
Hey.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.562
Is everything
okay with you?

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.399
Yeah.

01:01:43.665 --> 01:01:45.065
Do you
have bigger plans

01:01:45.067 --> 01:01:46.935
or was it just shitty wine?

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.608
Your place.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.712
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:02:02.484 --> 01:02:04.250
I can't remember
anything that happened

01:02:04.252 --> 01:02:05.319
more than a week ago.

01:02:07.856 --> 01:02:08.656
Nothing at all?

01:02:10.758 --> 01:02:11.559
Just

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.928
vague impressions, ghosts.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.432
I found these.

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:22.436
Crober knows a lot
more than she's saying.

01:02:23.704 --> 01:02:25.405
Where
did you get these?

01:02:26.939 --> 01:02:28.139
I

01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:29.607
took them from the office.

01:02:29.609 --> 01:02:31.177
You took them?

01:02:32.978 --> 01:02:34.879
Okay, I broke
in and I took them

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.213
and I know what you must think,

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:38.049
but I need answers.

01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:40.085
Seriously?

01:02:41.086 --> 01:02:42.821
I think it's awesome.

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:49.560
Could you play this for me?

01:02:49.562 --> 01:02:52.128
I don't know how to use it.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.964
I just

01:02:53.998 --> 01:02:55.431
can't go on like this.

01:02:57.068 --> 01:02:57.969
I know.

01:03:07.545 --> 01:03:11.149
Maximum of
education, experience

01:03:12.516 --> 01:03:13.317
and wisdom,

01:03:14.518 --> 01:03:15.687
who are lost to society.

01:03:16.654 --> 01:03:18.521
The potential that can be found

01:03:18.523 --> 01:03:21.623
in an artificially extended
life span goes well beyond...

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:23.060
Top menu, I guess?

01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:28.732
Try test subjects.

01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:33.234
There's
so many of them.

01:03:33.236 --> 01:03:34.070
Wait.

01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:36.606
I just saw my name.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:43.377
Are you really sure
you want to do this?

01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:44.313
I have to know.

01:03:52.855 --> 01:03:54.120
Why should I do this now?

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:55.357
I just wanna get started.

01:03:57.994 --> 01:04:01.126
I've been told that this
recording serves as proof

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:04.998
that I was not forced
to do any of this,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.865
no handcuffs, as you can see,

01:04:06.867 --> 01:04:10.536
and there is no one here
who has threatened me

01:04:10.538 --> 01:04:12.072
or is threatening me.

01:04:13.107 --> 01:04:15.576
I am here of my own free will.

01:04:16.911 --> 01:04:21.481
I will take part in an
experimental procedure today,

01:04:23.517 --> 01:04:26.385
this afternoon, voluntarily,

01:04:26.387 --> 01:04:31.391
that hopefully will
transform my wreck of a body,

01:04:31.992 --> 01:04:32.991
which used to be

01:04:38.765 --> 01:04:40.099
a different body

01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:46.940
into the body I know,
the body I remember.

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.409
We should
just stop here.

01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:53.412
No!

01:04:55.747 --> 01:05:00.317
The doctor said the pain
I feel from time to time

01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:04.486
under my skin, comes from
the tendons and muscles.

01:05:04.488 --> 01:05:06.658
It needs time to rejuvenate.

01:05:09.894 --> 01:05:12.461
Kira, please
look at the camera.

01:05:12.463 --> 01:05:13.295
Yes, of course.

01:05:13.297 --> 01:05:14.630
Sorry.

01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:15.396
I can
understand your excitement.

01:05:15.398 --> 01:05:16.532
It's not me.

01:05:16.534 --> 01:05:18.166
I find that hard to believe.

01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:20.035
That's some kind of nightmare.

01:05:20.037 --> 01:05:21.537
Do we begin again?

01:05:21.539 --> 01:05:22.503
Sorry.

01:05:22.505 --> 01:05:23.406
Please.

01:05:26.644 --> 01:05:31.181
My name is Kira Mabon. It
was my birthday yesterday,

01:05:32.682 --> 01:05:35.617
my 64th birthday.

01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:37.384
I must remind
you that the process

01:05:37.386 --> 01:05:38.586
is not yet complete.

01:05:38.588 --> 01:05:39.787
Kira, I don't
care about all that.

01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:41.255
It will
still be a few more days

01:05:41.257 --> 01:05:43.724
before we can evaluate
the final results.

01:05:43.726 --> 01:05:45.158
I love you.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.393
I love you, really.

01:05:46.395 --> 01:05:47.629
I keep
forgetting things.

01:05:47.631 --> 01:05:49.129
- Is that normal?
- Close your eyes

01:05:49.131 --> 01:05:51.165
It seems to be a
side effect of the treatment.

01:05:52.101 --> 01:05:53.467
I can't predict as to how...

01:05:53.469 --> 01:05:57.039
But will I still be
able to play the piano?

01:05:58.741 --> 01:06:00.474
We don't
know, not yet.

01:06:00.476 --> 01:06:01.577
How can you want me?

01:06:02.645 --> 01:06:04.944
I'm just an old woman.

01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:06.681
Aren't you disgusted?

01:06:07.816 --> 01:06:09.248
What about Jonas?

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.151
You and Jonas
divorced almost 20 years ago.

01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:14.687
And my daughter?

01:06:14.689 --> 01:06:17.990
We can contact
them for you if you like,

01:06:17.992 --> 01:06:19.457
but at this point...

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:27.567
My daughter.

01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:31.570
I had a daughter?

01:06:36.276 --> 01:06:37.710
I don't even remember her.

01:06:40.646 --> 01:06:42.080
Don't think about it.

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:43.114
Not now.

01:06:43.116 --> 01:06:44.049
Maybe there's,

01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:46.984
I can contact her somehow, or...

01:06:46.986 --> 01:06:48.619
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:06:48.621 --> 01:06:49.455
Why not?

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.895
Because she wouldn't
even recognize you.

01:06:57.797 --> 01:06:58.797
Oh my God.

01:07:00.265 --> 01:07:01.664
I can't take this.

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:02.900
It's all going to start again,

01:07:02.902 --> 01:07:05.202
the pain and the dry spots.

01:07:06.638 --> 01:07:08.705
I can't take any more.

01:07:08.707 --> 01:07:09.607
It will be okay.

01:07:10.976 --> 01:07:12.875
Crober will figure
something out.

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:14.711
No, you don't understand.

01:07:14.713 --> 01:07:15.978
It's okay.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.549
We'll face this thing together.

01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:24.455
Why don't we just go

01:07:25.388 --> 01:07:27.256
someplace they'll never find us,

01:07:28.092 --> 01:07:30.861
Crober, everyone,

01:07:31.929 --> 01:07:33.360
pack our bags and leave.

01:07:33.362 --> 01:07:34.930
You're
not the only one

01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:36.200
who's been trough this.

01:07:37.467 --> 01:07:40.570
What about the
other test objects?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.239
I don't want to go in there.

01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:48.175
What are you frightened of?

01:07:48.177 --> 01:07:49.011
Ghosts?

01:07:51.347 --> 01:07:52.182
Yes.

01:07:54.649 --> 01:07:55.484
Ghosts.

01:07:57.687 --> 01:08:00.922
Maybe they're just memories
of your earlier life.

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:07.526
Hey, you've got
to face all that.

01:08:07.528 --> 01:08:09.662
I'll try to help you through it

01:08:09.664 --> 01:08:10.766
in any way I can.

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:12.932
You know I will.

01:08:12.934 --> 01:08:14.800
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:08:14.802 --> 01:08:16.037
No, you don't.

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.206
Pack your things
and wait downstairs.

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.674
I'll be five minutes.

01:08:22.676 --> 01:08:23.742
I promise.

01:08:52.805 --> 01:08:54.703
Hello?

01:08:54.706 --> 01:08:55.805
Honey, I'm on the phone.

01:08:56.774 --> 01:08:59.309
Honey, I'm on the phone.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.078
Hello, is anyone there?

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080
I'm sorry.

01:09:22.532 --> 01:09:24.899
You have your own daughter now,

01:09:24.902 --> 01:09:25.937
your own life.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:27.971
Let me have mine.

01:10:49.615 --> 01:10:50.449
Sorry.

01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:58.423
It's time to move on.

01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:11.070
Everything okay?

01:11:13.972 --> 01:11:15.373
Let's get out of here.

01:11:23.381 --> 01:11:25.513
Do you think, the others are
going through the same thing?

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.284
Have they also
forgotten everything?

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:30.255
There
is only one way to find out.

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.456
Nobody, again.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.292
Nobody.

01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:39.493
So who's next?

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.431
Margaret Jondra.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.068
Maybe she's still alive.

01:12:21.702 --> 01:12:23.303
What'd she have to say?

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:25.171
She hasn't seen
her for a few weeks.

01:12:25.173 --> 01:12:27.942
Said she had some sort of
allergies, some skin thing.

01:12:29.642 --> 01:12:31.844
She had about a month
worth mail on her porch

01:12:31.846 --> 01:12:32.680
and these.

01:12:35.316 --> 01:12:37.216
Jesus, what a horror show.

01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:38.085
Retinol,

01:12:39.286 --> 01:12:40.920
fine line reducers,

01:12:41.788 --> 01:12:44.088
exfoliating creams,

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:45.156
beauty products.

01:12:45.158 --> 01:12:46.427
Maybe they got her too.

01:13:04.511 --> 01:13:06.078
There's something I need to do.

01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:30.368
Will you
get that, honey?

01:13:31.235 --> 01:13:32.636
Are you here for the party?

01:13:34.705 --> 01:13:35.937
Party?

01:13:35.939 --> 01:13:37.475
It's my birthday!

01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:42.546
Really?

01:13:46.283 --> 01:13:48.083
And how old are you?

01:13:48.085 --> 01:13:49.384
I'm six.

01:13:49.386 --> 01:13:50.186
Six?

01:13:54.558 --> 01:13:56.559
You look older than six.

01:13:59.595 --> 01:14:01.695
How old are you?

01:14:02.964 --> 01:14:04.866
Hon, everything okay?

01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:07.536
Who's here?

01:14:14.676 --> 01:14:15.511
Wait.

01:14:21.683 --> 01:14:23.684
Let's get out of here.

01:14:52.011 --> 01:14:53.412
It'll never stop.

01:14:55.382 --> 01:14:57.217
There has
to be a solution.

01:14:58.683 --> 01:15:00.453
You have to go back to Crober.

01:15:01.621 --> 01:15:03.389
I don't want to die
as someone's guinea pig.

01:15:29.414 --> 01:15:31.082
You can't go on like this.

01:15:35.186 --> 01:15:36.153
Promise me.

01:15:38.456 --> 01:15:40.389
Promise me you'll try.

01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:42.324
Crober can help you.

01:15:42.326 --> 01:15:44.328
Right now she's
your only chance.

01:15:45.162 --> 01:15:45.995
I can't.

01:16:14.489 --> 01:16:15.924
You must hate the way I look.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.394
No.

01:16:22.397 --> 01:16:24.533
I never wanted to lie to you.

01:16:32.306 --> 01:16:36.677
I majored in biochemistry,
not in Chinese linguistics.

01:16:37.945 --> 01:16:40.311
Crober asked me to
keep an eye on you.

01:16:49.923 --> 01:16:51.756
You knew all along?

01:16:51.758 --> 01:16:54.226
You were our greatest success,

01:16:55.562 --> 01:16:57.528
our star patient.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.667
Crober paid me a shit load
of money to look after you.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.236
Wouldn't have had to though.

01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:10.276
The water.

01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:13.613
I put something in it.

01:17:16.814 --> 01:17:20.886
You would never have gone
back there on your own.

01:17:21.719 --> 01:17:22.787
I'm so sorry.

01:18:05.194 --> 01:18:06.661
I'm sorry,

01:18:06.663 --> 01:18:08.765
but that sort of thing
needs to be done quickly.

01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:13.169
I see you've met Miss Jondra.

01:18:15.204 --> 01:18:16.035
It's a shame.

01:18:16.037 --> 01:18:17.372
She was so promising.

01:18:18.774 --> 01:18:21.508
Unfortunately she won't last
much longer, I'm afraid.

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:22.611
But you're here now.

01:18:23.977 --> 01:18:25.611
I should never have
allowed the test subjects

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:26.414
out of the lab.

01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:28.782
Letting you live at home,

01:18:28.784 --> 01:18:32.886
even under supervision,
was a terrible mistake.

01:18:34.088 --> 01:18:35.321
Sooner or later, the police

01:18:35.323 --> 01:18:38.123
would have followed
your trail back to me.

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:40.693
And it's far too soon
for any public disclosure

01:18:40.695 --> 01:18:42.294
of our procedures.

01:18:42.296 --> 01:18:43.130
Why?

01:18:44.097 --> 01:18:45.965
Well, Ms. Mabon,

01:18:48.335 --> 01:18:49.802
you begged me.

01:18:49.804 --> 01:18:54.171
You spent years going to
every medical conference

01:18:54.173 --> 01:18:56.408
and research
institute you could,

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:59.744
searching for
something or someone

01:18:59.746 --> 01:19:01.080
to make you young again.

01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:05.449
Why can't I remember anything?

01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:10.321
Yeah, it's a side effect
of the regeneration process.

01:19:10.323 --> 01:19:14.090
But in your case, not
necessarily an unfortunate one.

01:19:14.092 --> 01:19:15.795
You weren't very happy.

01:19:17.129 --> 01:19:19.131
But, what about Jonas?

01:19:20.132 --> 01:19:21.066
And my little girl?

01:19:22.401 --> 01:19:24.801
I can't even remember her name.

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:26.836
The cellular
rejuvenation was designed

01:19:26.838 --> 01:19:28.538
to only regenerate those areas

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:32.608
most strongly affected
by the aging process.

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:37.045
But you suffered a reset
of the memory center.

01:19:37.047 --> 01:19:40.384
Otherwise, I'd say the
experiment was a successful one.

01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:42.854
And the others?

01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:48.492
But why does your body

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.596
accept foreign
skin so perfectly?

01:19:55.932 --> 01:19:56.767
Hmm?

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:14.082
We'll know soon enough.

01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:52.185
Not so
hot now, is she.

01:21:14.372 --> 01:21:16.909
Don't be frightened.

01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:20.112
So near.

01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:30.088
Not good at all,

01:21:31.122 --> 01:21:32.056
not for you

01:21:36.728 --> 01:21:37.996
and certainly not for me.

01:21:46.103 --> 01:21:49.271
Although the effect that your
body does accept foreign skin

01:21:49.273 --> 01:21:50.171
so well,

01:21:52.142 --> 01:21:53.610
opens new pathways.

01:21:55.545 --> 01:21:58.580
Your current condition reveals

01:21:58.582 --> 01:22:01.485
that this project is
nowhere near its goals.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.958
We will be testing a number
of new theories on you.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.097
Completely painless, so
there's no cause for concern.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:22.971
Be reasonable.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.342
You must realize, at
least on some level,

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.046
that you acted irresponsibly.

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:36.217
You recklessly endangered
decades of work.

01:22:37.217 --> 01:22:38.252
The first time was

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:40.855
understandable.

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:43.891
But after that, I,

01:22:46.226 --> 01:22:48.562
I don't know how you justify it.

01:22:54.868 --> 01:22:55.703
And all

01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:58.005
for

01:23:00.573 --> 01:23:01.940
vanity.

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:10.750
Your cellular structure
seems to be overwhelmed

01:23:12.184 --> 01:23:14.286
by the extreme demands
of the regeneration.

01:23:17.256 --> 01:23:21.358
The good news is we have
perhaps found an approach

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.295
to keep you in a more
stable condition.

01:23:32.303 --> 01:23:35.839
Hopefully, we'll be able to
duplicate your body's readiness

01:23:35.841 --> 01:23:37.075
to accept new skin,

01:23:38.609 --> 01:23:41.145
the cause for the very unfortunate
decay of your own skin,

01:23:42.948 --> 01:23:44.882
but of similar origins.

01:24:21.283 --> 01:24:26.187
You should begin to get your
voice back later this evening.

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:31.093
Please don't make
a scene this time.

01:24:34.163 --> 01:24:36.165
You've only been
here a few days.

01:24:42.804 --> 01:24:44.303
Hmm.

01:24:44.305 --> 01:24:47.106
The new skin is taking root

01:24:47.108 --> 01:24:49.043
really fast.

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:26.343
Come on.

01:25:26.345 --> 01:25:27.679
It's time to go.

01:25:32.184 --> 01:25:33.717
You have to hurry.

01:25:36.253 --> 01:25:37.322
I'm trying.

01:25:55.505 --> 01:25:57.105
Just
pull out your hand.

01:25:57.107 --> 01:25:58.206
Sophia.

01:25:58.208 --> 01:25:59.543
You can do it.

01:26:02.512 --> 01:26:03.847
Ignore the pain.

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:36.675
Jesus, what the fuck
did you do to her?

01:26:36.677 --> 01:26:38.678
You promised me you were
taking good care of her.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.513
She did that to herself.

01:26:40.515 --> 01:26:41.950
Well, get a nurse.

01:26:43.384 --> 01:26:45.187
Do something, for God's sake.

01:26:49.758 --> 01:26:50.591
Kira, Kira.

01:26:52.927 --> 01:26:54.196
I'm going to get you out.

01:26:55.596 --> 01:26:56.761
Really?

01:26:56.763 --> 01:26:58.462
Yeah. Really.

01:26:58.464 --> 01:26:59.731
No.

01:26:59.733 --> 01:27:00.801
Not really.

01:27:03.137 --> 01:27:04.737
You're out of control, Crober.

01:27:05.772 --> 01:27:07.239
What you're doing is...

01:27:07.241 --> 01:27:09.107
Please, human kind has been
fighting the aging process

01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:10.540
for thousands of years.

01:27:10.542 --> 01:27:13.444
Who's going to worry
about a few test subjects

01:27:13.446 --> 01:27:18.450
once people get to live to
a 150, 300, 600 years old?

01:27:19.219 --> 01:27:20.350
This is insanity.

01:27:20.352 --> 01:27:22.485
She willingly
volunteered, didn't she?

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:23.420
She knew the risks.

01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:24.621
She doesn't even remember.

01:27:24.623 --> 01:27:26.823
She obviously
remembers something.

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.226
She was calling your name.

01:27:28.228 --> 01:27:31.094
God, you're really
losing it, Crober.

01:27:31.096 --> 01:27:32.494
You need help.

01:27:32.496 --> 01:27:34.331
If they trace those killings
back to the institute,

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:37.167
back to us, then you'll
be just as culpable.

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:38.834
She was in your care, after all.

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:41.271
I'm willing to take that risk.

01:27:41.273 --> 01:27:45.107
I may have been of this
once, but not anymore.

01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:46.075
Oh, Kira.

01:27:46.077 --> 01:27:47.243
She promised to help.

01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:48.510
She said that there was a cure,

01:27:48.512 --> 01:27:50.215
that you only had
to come back here.

01:27:51.883 --> 01:27:53.918
I'm so fucking stupid

01:27:55.086 --> 01:27:56.220
to believe that.

01:27:57.588 --> 01:27:58.853
I'm so sorry.

01:27:58.855 --> 01:28:00.356
You're
wasting your breath.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:01.789
She's just going to
forget you again,

01:28:01.791 --> 01:28:03.225
like she always does.

01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:05.660
I'm taking
her out of here, Crober.

01:28:05.662 --> 01:28:08.198
Somebody out there has
to be able to help her.

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:12.166
I'll take this to the
media if I have to.

01:29:59.636 --> 01:30:00.571
You okay?

01:30:03.107 --> 01:30:04.940
What did she give you?

01:30:04.942 --> 01:30:05.809
Succs probably.

01:30:07.177 --> 01:30:08.909
Succs?

01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:10.778
Succinylcholine.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.914
Let's just go.

01:30:14.018 --> 01:30:15.550
The irony would be priceless.

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.224
You've gotta be out
of your fucking mind.

01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:23.625
Kira.

01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:27.130
I know.

01:30:28.998 --> 01:30:30.433
You're
going to lose yourself.

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.070
You cant keep doing this.

01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:36.304
Yes.

01:30:37.806 --> 01:30:39.641
Promise me, no more.

01:30:47.716 --> 01:30:50.349
Let's try the emergency exit.

01:30:50.351 --> 01:30:51.420
Kira, please.

01:31:02.596 --> 01:31:03.895
We need
something for that Succs.

01:31:05.799 --> 01:31:07.032
GenRes Laboratories

01:31:07.034 --> 01:31:09.802
are now under complete lockdown.

01:31:09.804 --> 01:31:11.402
All personnel, please check in

01:31:11.404 --> 01:31:14.339
with your designated
security areas.

01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:17.175
A level two warning
is in effect.

01:31:17.177 --> 01:31:20.244
Please be advised that
lethal force may be used

01:31:20.246 --> 01:31:21.581
against potential intruders.

01:31:35.094 --> 01:31:36.327
Hello?

01:31:36.329 --> 01:31:37.561
Julie, are you okay?

01:31:37.563 --> 01:31:38.794
The police
are on their way.

01:31:38.796 --> 01:31:39.595
It's a lockdown?

01:31:39.597 --> 01:31:40.831
Fuck, what happened?

01:31:40.833 --> 01:31:41.498
I don't
know what happened.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.999
Don't panic.

01:31:43.001 --> 01:31:43.800
But,
all the doors are locked.

01:31:43.802 --> 01:31:45.000
We cannot get out.

01:31:45.002 --> 01:31:45.935
GenRes Laboratories

01:31:45.937 --> 01:31:47.972
are now under complete lockdown.

01:31:49.907 --> 01:31:51.941
Please, be careful, Julie.

01:31:51.943 --> 01:31:54.410
I'll keep my
eyes open, don't worry.

01:31:58.715 --> 01:31:59.550
Wait,

01:32:01.519 --> 01:32:04.053
it's them, I need
to call security.

01:32:04.055 --> 01:32:05.220
Julie, are you there?

01:32:06.156 --> 01:32:07.255
Kira.

01:32:11.195 --> 01:32:11.995
Kira, no.

01:32:22.372 --> 01:32:23.704
GenRes Laboratories

01:32:23.706 --> 01:32:25.006
is now under complete lockdown.

01:32:25.008 --> 01:32:28.175
What did
she give you again?

01:32:28.177 --> 01:32:31.279
Succinylcholine.

01:32:31.281 --> 01:32:34.850
It probably won't kill
me, but I feel cold.

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:54.167
There
seems to be a security breach

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.034
on level two.

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.735
Roger that.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.037
Could you check that?

01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:58.971
Please be alert.

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.507
The subject is very dangerous.

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:02.343
Copy.

01:33:03.777 --> 01:33:05.044
Please
keep your cool, everybody.

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.844
Word has it that Doctor
Crober has been killed.

01:33:06.846 --> 01:33:08.547
The patient, Kira Mabon,

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.282
a former GenRes employee,

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:13.786
Sophia Demeraux, both
need to be detained.

01:33:15.322 --> 01:33:17.455
Notify us
immediately if you see her,

01:33:17.457 --> 01:33:19.157
the little fuckin' bitch.

01:33:19.159 --> 01:33:20.558
Copy that.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.358
Are on their way.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.594
I repeat, at this time,

01:33:22.596 --> 01:33:23.528
subject is an emergency.

01:33:52.657 --> 01:33:55.290
I won't have
to go out there, will I?

01:33:55.292 --> 01:33:56.626
We're just
gonna get your stuff

01:33:56.628 --> 01:33:59.728
and then it'll be all
right, you'll see.

01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:00.764
I need an antidote.

01:34:01.932 --> 01:34:03.265
What for?

01:34:03.267 --> 01:34:05.336
Succs, Succinylcholine.

01:34:06.438 --> 01:34:07.869
There is no antidote.

01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:08.704
I'm sorry.

01:34:08.706 --> 01:34:09.671
I don't believe you.

01:34:09.673 --> 01:34:10.674
It's true.

01:34:12.176 --> 01:34:15.176
It's a muscle
relaxant, short acting.

01:34:15.178 --> 01:34:16.444
There is no antidote,

01:34:16.446 --> 01:34:19.514
not that I know of,

01:34:19.516 --> 01:34:21.118
but it's not lethal.

01:35:19.105 --> 01:35:20.440
Kira.

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:24.344
The uniforms will
get us out of here.

01:35:25.844 --> 01:35:28.515
That will never work.

01:35:38.724 --> 01:35:41.258
You broke your promise.

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.861
I'm sorry.

01:35:49.802 --> 01:35:51.737
So what now?

01:35:53.071 --> 01:35:55.239
I want to live with you.

01:36:01.012 --> 01:36:01.913
That's all.

01:36:18.795 --> 01:36:19.629
Sophia.

01:36:22.199 --> 01:36:24.034
I love you too much.
