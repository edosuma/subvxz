WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.086
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:06.090 --> 00:09.133
You got a sonogram picture
taped to your bathroom mirror.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.010
I'm not married,
if that's what you're wondering.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.136
She kicked you out?

00:12.221 --> 00:16.849
There's supposed to be $3 million in here,
Limehouse. Way north of $3 million.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.435
Look, it's all spent,
except what you see right there.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.522
I believe the terms of the deal
are I receive the money

00:22.606 --> 00:24.232
and then we are through, isn't that right?

00:24.316 --> 00:25.733
That's right. Those are the terms.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.695
Then you take it back.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.905
I'm gonna kill you, Raylan.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.409
Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow,

00:34.493 --> 00:35.952
but some day,
you'll be walking down the street,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.162
and I'm gonna put a bullet
right in the back of your skull,

00:38.247 --> 00:40.289
and you're gonna drop.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.675
Why wait?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.554
Just so we're clear,

00:54.638 --> 00:58.182
the other night, you throw down the gauntlet
to a trigger-happy US Marshal,

00:58.267 --> 00:59.434
and this morning,

00:59.977 --> 01:02.395
you remember you have
pressing business out of town?

01:02.479 --> 01:04.397
I told you, I'll be back in a couple hours.

01:06.442 --> 01:10.319
And what if Givens comes by,
wanting to finish the game?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.196
You may tell him that he is welcome to wait.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.825
You know, you disappoint me, Wynn.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.163
Word around the Detroit campfire
is that you were a wild man.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.707
Comes to a little nut-cutting,
suddenly you want to bitch out.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.417
Don't be like the rest of them.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.336
You can't have the Duffy without the Wynn.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.214
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.678
Hey.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.930
Hey. Morning.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.725
Just getting some coffee, and then I'll...

01:41.143 --> 01:42.351
You can take a seat.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.729
No, I don't want to be in your way.
You're setting up.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.230
I don't mind.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.524
Okay.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.693
If I had eggs, I'd make you breakfast.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.111
Well, thank you.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.696
You want a shot in that?

01:54.406 --> 01:57.074
I usually like to wait
till the sun's all the way up.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.369
It's afternoon somewhere.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.332
- Listen, Lindsey...
- Stop.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.958
You don't even know what I'm gonna say.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.877
I think you're gonna apologize again

02:07.961 --> 02:10.588
for not giving me a full accounting
of every second of your life

02:10.672 --> 02:13.549
before you heartlessly accepted
the gift of my feminine virtue.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.762
Well, when you put it that way,
I guess don't owe you an apology.

02:17.888 --> 02:22.141
First time you came in here,
I knew you were going through something.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.895
To tell you the truth, I feel a little bad
taking advantage of you.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.605
Really?

02:27.689 --> 02:30.274
I mean, not so bad
I don't plan on doing it again.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.236
- Listen, Lindsey...
- You said that already.

02:34.279 --> 02:38.032
- I'm about to become a father.
- I know. I saw the sonogram.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.576
It's a good-looking kid.
It's got its daddy's eyes.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.288
An unfortunate nose, though.
That must be your ex's.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.917
I'm gonna get some limes in the back.
I won't be a sec.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.296
I'm sorry, guys. We're closed.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.633
Heard you had a little mischief in here
the other night.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.635
Well, I wasn't aware that made the news.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.095
We had a friend who was here.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.888
He tell you about the hot wings?

03:01.223 --> 03:03.933
This friend of ours,
I'm betting you wouldn't forget him.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.768
He looks like he even shits blond.

03:05.853 --> 03:09.438
I don't suppose you two fellas
are from Detroit, are you?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.274
That's a hell of a guess.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.944
Where you buy your suit?
Gallo's on Michigan Avenue?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.195
I don't buy suits.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.446
Boss buy them for you?

03:17.573 --> 03:19.240
Our boss doesn't buy us anything.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.994
When I first saw him, he was wearing
this little gray sharkskin number,

03:23.078 --> 03:27.707
made him look like a kid playing a gangster
in a school play.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.376
We don't work for that gentleman.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.130
You work for his daddy.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.549
So, what?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.927
Theo Tonin decided little Sammy
overstepped when he cut Quarles off,

03:40.012 --> 03:42.221
decided to send some new muscle instead.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.515
Hence, you two knuckleheads.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.768
- You don't want to take that tone.
- Why is that, champ?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.854
I get the impression
they only keep you around

03:49.938 --> 03:53.316
so little Sammy doesn't feel like
the biggest asshole in the room.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.238
Raylan.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.327
Oh, hey.
I was just telling these guys we're closed.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.246
And I believe they were leaving.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.749
Another time, then.

04:10.834 --> 04:14.337
Good. See? There's gonna be another time.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.017
I'll clean that up.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.426
Firing a shot in the air in a crowded bar.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.720
- That could be a hiccup.
- Yeah.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.972
Let's see.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.141
You knew that you had to get
the patrons out of harm's way,

05:09.226 --> 05:12.561
and they'd already failed
to heed your order to evacuate.

05:12.646 --> 05:16.107
You knew that there was nothing above you
but your own empty apartment,

05:16.191 --> 05:18.567
so you fired a shot in the air,

05:18.652 --> 05:21.821
even though you knew
it was against Marshals' policy

05:21.905 --> 05:24.532
because you thought it was the only thing
they would hear above the music.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.909
- Write it like that.
- Thanks, Art.

05:27.953 --> 05:32.456
Well, good news is, now we have
a nice federal charge against Mr. Quarles.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.127
We just start with the bartender,
and we round up some of the other...

05:36.211 --> 05:37.962
Bartender doesn't make a good witness.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.839
- What's wrong with him?
- Her.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.426
- Oh, Jesus, Raylan.
- It doesn't matter, Art.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.262
We want Quarles
for more than this piddly shit.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.265
Threatening a federal officer
is more than piddly shit.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.851
We had Dickie Bennett
for actually trussing up an officer,

05:51.935 --> 05:54.687
trying to brain him with a Louisville Slugger.
How'd that work out?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.355
Look, Raylan, just pick him up, all right?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.566
We got patrons in there
we can use as witnesses.

05:59.109 --> 06:03.195
If we don't have Quarles threatening you,
we just got you firing shots into the ceiling.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.781
Wait just a second.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.201
Why? I thought it was a top priority
that I go bring in Quarles

06:09.286 --> 06:11.495
for the capital offense of hurting my feelings.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.873
It is, but the son of a bitch
is threatening your life.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.207
I can't let you go by yourself.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.168
Tim and Rachel are at Tramble.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.627
You honestly expect me to wait for them?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.171
No.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.630
No way.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.132
Way.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.484
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.117
You want I should open it up?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.953
Might not be the wisest idea
given the surroundings.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.956
Well, am I gonna see a little
something-something in there

06:56.041 --> 06:57.458
I haven't seen before?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.087
Maybe something that might make me
the Harlan millionaire

07:01.171 --> 07:02.505
I was always meant to be.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.758
You'll see 46 and change.
Plus a couple of receipts.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.844
Is that right? Receipts, too. I tell you what.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.098
You can just leave that shit shut, brother.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.682
You still not gonna take it, huh?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.728
Oh, now, I will. I will take it,

07:17.854 --> 07:22.733
just as soon as it starts adding up
to everything I'm rightfully owed.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.360
You understand?

07:24.736 --> 07:28.155
Till then, you know, you can't really
blame me for wanting a real good reason

07:28.240 --> 07:30.574
to hold my head up
when I try to explain to people

07:30.659 --> 07:33.786
why it is that Ellstin Limehouse
somehow sees fit

07:33.870 --> 07:36.705
to cheat me out of my family's fortune.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.501
Well, as you know Mr. Limehouse,

07:40.585 --> 07:42.253
you really want it to get back to him that

07:42.337 --> 07:44.421
you're running your mouth
on his reputation?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.674
Think he the type to sit still
for something like that?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.390
Is that the best you got, sister?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.309
Whatever you decided with the cooler,

07:57.394 --> 07:59.603
Mr. Limehouse said to give you
the ride back home.

08:02.858 --> 08:06.152
Well, that is just... That's real considerate.
But I'll tell you what.

08:06.278 --> 08:10.072
I think I'm just gonna have these bastards
call me a cab, you know.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.909
The least they could do.
You know what I'm saying?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.078
Real good to see you.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.003
What do you think's in the cooler?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.089
Probably not a human head.

08:27.591 --> 08:28.924
That'd be cool.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.510
If you're here to talk about
running me in the special election,

08:31.595 --> 08:33.761
there's some things
we gonna straighten out first.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.889
Such as?

08:35.222 --> 08:37.892
Such as, this is staying my office.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.311
No more talk about putting me
in a broom closet.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.022
I guess if I were to offer
to back yet another of your campaigns,

08:43.106 --> 08:44.773
I'd say that as long as
I'm putting up the money,

08:44.858 --> 08:47.943
I'd put you anywhere I goddamned please.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.487
Fortunately, I'm not here to pony up.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.199
In fact, I'm here to take back
what I previously ponied.

08:53.283 --> 08:57.077
You can't seriously expect me
to give you that money back.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.414
Well, that's exactly what I expect.
And I'm very serious.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.917
Well, it's gone, spent.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.545
- On what?
- Campaign expenses.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.173
I do believe my wife dipped into it a little bit.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.508
Mr. Napier, I am not an unreasonable man.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.094
I don't expect the actual bills that I gave you.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.264
Just give me bills of equivalent worth,
and we'll call it even.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.642
I don't have it. Not even close.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.687
That is disappointing.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.357
I don't know how in the hell you expect me
to get that money...

09:26.441 --> 09:28.234
As I was saying, I am a reasonable man,

09:28.318 --> 09:31.528
and I'm happy to help you
find a way to square up.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.032
I don't suppose you'd already happen
to have something in mind, would you?

09:35.116 --> 09:38.118
For starters, an address
of some local miscreant

09:38.203 --> 09:40.496
known to have large amounts
of cash lying around,

09:40.580 --> 09:44.333
known further to have secrets that would
discourage him from calling the police

09:44.417 --> 09:47.002
if someone were to relieve him of it.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.838
You want me to find you
a drug dealer to rob?

09:50.006 --> 09:52.424
You know, I couldn't have said it
better myself.

09:52.509 --> 09:56.470
And if said miscreant in question
happens to pay Boyd Crowder for protection,

09:56.554 --> 09:57.763
so much the better.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.473
Sure you want to poke that bear?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.518
That bear poked me.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.188
Mr. Quarles, you already managed
to lose me the sheriff's office.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.608
Now you want to involve me
in an armed-robbery conspiracy?

10:09.693 --> 10:13.112
Actually, I'm gonna need you to find me
a buyer for the shit that I take off of this guy.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.864
So technically, that makes it
a drug conspiracy, as well.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.117
And what if I say no?

10:18.201 --> 10:19.868
Oh, you don't want to say no.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.253
Oh! What...

10:30.463 --> 10:32.423
Excuse me.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.258
Rodney. Hey, boy.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.553
What's up with
the hot-rod entourage here, Rod?

10:37.679 --> 10:41.974
Last time we saw each other,
I had a gun pointed at my face.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.183
Yes, you did.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.395
You and me both had ourselves held up,
may I remind you.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.314
And then the next time I come down here,

10:48.398 --> 10:52.026
some squirrelly little shit
from Crowder's crew tried to muscle me.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.153
Oh! You got to be kidding me.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.072
I ain't kidding. You can believe it.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.117
Sometimes I'm glad your daddy didn't live

11:00.201 --> 11:02.786
to see what's happening
to the drug business.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.204
Thank you.

11:04.289 --> 11:08.083
But you didn't ask me down here
to pay my respects.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.003
That is the truth,
and we should get down to business.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.923
If you wouldn't mind, please, first,
call off your dogs a bit here.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.218
My friend.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.514
All right, now, as I started to say,

11:22.599 --> 11:24.516
at the time she passed,

11:25.101 --> 11:29.355
my mama, she had a little over $3 million.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.024
Do you know where to find it?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.942
Well, I know who's got it, okay?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.320
And he has been doing everything
he can think of

11:36.404 --> 11:38.781
to try to get me to believe
that there's only $46,000.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.367
He's been sticking it in this little cooler,
trying to get me to take it.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.202
"Here, take it. Here..." I've been saying...

11:43.286 --> 11:46.080
Get to the who! The suspense is killing me.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.750
Ellstin Limehouse.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.546
So, what's the plan?
We gonna shoot our way into Nobles Holler?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.257
Yeah, at some point, we are gonna
have to shoot our way in there

11:57.342 --> 11:59.176
and grab the money
and get back across the bridge

11:59.260 --> 12:00.552
before they knew what hit them.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.805
That's not exactly my usual line.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.974
Although $3 million

12:07.644 --> 12:10.687
might justify a man stepping outside himself.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.231
It just might.

12:12.315 --> 12:16.110
Yeah, I am aware that we need
to find out exactly where my money is

12:16.194 --> 12:17.736
before we do anything.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.072
And that is exactly why
I asked you down here.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.573
Not how it works, Dickie.

12:21.658 --> 12:26.453
I'm willing to make some calls for you,
but you're gonna have to do the heavy lifting.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.622
I don't think you understand, man.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.958
I can't just be strolling around
out in the open,

12:31.042 --> 12:33.127
- asking people...
- Dickie!

12:33.211 --> 12:36.088
..."Hey, do you happen to know where
my money is that Limehouse is hiding?"

12:36.172 --> 12:40.050
At sundown, we're headed back to Memphis.
You best get to moving.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.053
Okay, so, that would be the end
of the discussion right there.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.472
I say we pop him and be done with it.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.057
Before he leads us to the money?

12:47.142 --> 12:51.270
Just so long as it's not before
he suffers some.

12:51.521 --> 12:55.107
How do you suggest we do that, Arlo?
With the feds watching him?

12:55.191 --> 12:58.110
We need to stop wasting our time
on Dickie Bennett.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.611
We should be out there showing the flag.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.449
Maybe if you spent less time questioning
your orders and more time following them,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.951
our protection money
wouldn't be dropping off.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.788
Our protection money is dropping off
because since Delroy disappeared

13:09.873 --> 13:12.666
and we inherited all of his whores,
there are people out there paying money,

13:12.750 --> 13:14.042
they don't know what they're paying for.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.628
All right, that's enough.
I'm gonna kill Dickie Bennett.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.673
And when I do, I'm gonna take my time.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.301
But not before he leads us
to the promised land.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.721
Johnny, go back out there
and see what else you can find.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.644
When I was posted in Manhattan,

13:32.729 --> 13:35.355
a chief deputy there,
this big guy named Langston,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.524
he used to spend one day a week in the field.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.152
Said it was the only way
he could "feel the pulse."

13:40.236 --> 13:41.236
"The pulse"?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.696
- The pulse.
- Of the street?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.615
Yeah, man. New York in the '80s.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.451
So, that's why you come along?
"Feel the pulse."

13:47.535 --> 13:50.496
Nah, some asshole threatened
to kill one of my deputies.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.122
I'm the only one that gets to do that.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.207
I'm touched.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.750
You know what?

13:56.961 --> 13:59.087
I might ought to just go by myself.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.422
Because?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.050
Because when he sees you,
he's liable to start shooting.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.426
All right, just admit it.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.222
You're worried about me,
worried I'm gonna get shot.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.599
I'm worried I'm gonna get shot.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.186
Who's your new friend?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.104
- He's down from Lexington.
- Hi.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.318
Guess if the DEA was gonna send
an undercover in here,

14:21.444 --> 14:23.445
hard to imagine they'd choose him.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.072
Thank you.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.240
Hi.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.076
Wow. Quite a place.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.709
I thought you said I didn't look like a cop.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.795
That don't mean I think you look right.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.592
Is it true they test a samurai sword
by cutting through paper?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.427
This is a katana.

14:49.305 --> 14:55.852
My granddad pulled this off
a dead Jap officer at Shuri Castle, Okinawa.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.688
The greatest generation at work.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.650
He was a lying old sack of shit.
Probably just bought it.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.318
What you looking for, brother?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.695
What you got?

15:04.821 --> 15:09.616
I got a fresh batch of crystal, coke,
pills, little bit of smack.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.245
Got guns, too,
if you're willing to take a drive.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.664
Also, if you're looking for company,

15:15.748 --> 15:20.502
I got this little 16-year-old honey
just up the hill, 50 bucks.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.631
No, I'll just look at the crystal, you know.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.384
Sure thing.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.431
You just be real careful
how you move around in here, pop.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.641
Don't touch shit till you pay.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.562
Whoa! Holy shit.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.900
You see how clear that is, brother?
Hold it up to the sun, you can burn ants.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.069
Oh, that's just beautiful.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.573
I mean, don't you guys worry
about leaving all this stuff out in the open?

15:49.657 --> 15:51.742
Cops come in here,
they're coming in to search.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.869
They'll find it even if it's hidden
inside the wall.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.746
That's a good point, but, you know,
not just about the cops.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.540
I mean, where I'm from,
the dealers rip each other off all the time.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.751
Yet you have your trunk unlocked.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.753
People don't steal from us.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.379
Is that so?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.840
Your questions are starting
to get on my nerves, brother.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.969
I think it's time you did your business,
went on your way.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.348
Sure thing. Sure thing.
But I do have one little question, though.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.351
How do you get that rust spot
off of your sword?

16:41.084 --> 16:42.668
What a dick!

16:56.349 --> 16:59.267
I was starting to think the only flavor
they served around here was vanilla.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.228
I'm a Deputy United States Marshal.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.522
- Oh, how nice for you.
- I need to talk to your boss.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.066
Easy, now, sister.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.529
Unless you have a warrant,
there just ain't no way.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.865
I don't need a warrant to talk.
Get out of my way.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.368
You touched me.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.871
Would you like me to do it again?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.295
Something we can help you with?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.257
You can start by telling your boys
to put their guns on the floor

17:30.341 --> 17:31.967
and then back away from them.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.594
Or, I guess, maybe
you can have one of them shoot me.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.557
But is Dickie Bennett really worth
dying in a federal gas chamber?

17:38.975 --> 17:41.810
And those are the only two options
you see for us, huh?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.396
There's a third. You could die right here.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.402
Okay. Okay.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.072
Dickie. Jesus.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.200
You know Boyd Crowder
runs this place now.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.203
"Dickie, Jesus"? Ho!
Is that any way to greet a dear friend?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.329
- Dickie...
- Come here.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.915
No, no, no. You can't stay here. No.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.584
- Yeah, I know.
- Dickie, please.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.252
If Boyd finds us here, he'll kill us.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.087
Yeah, okay. Listen, listen to me.
I need your help.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.799
Okay? And if you can't help, I really...

18:12.884 --> 18:17.220
No, I can't think of a better place
to meet the reaper than right here.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.764
What do you mean, you need my help?

18:18.848 --> 18:21.224
Okay, here's the thing. Here's the thing.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.811
You see, over the years, you've had
to spend some time up in Nobles,

18:24.896 --> 18:27.230
hiding out from some man or in trouble.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.733
These friends of yours
who are doing the hiding, they...

18:29.817 --> 18:33.528
I'm wondering if they maybe
might have heard something

18:33.613 --> 18:39.201
about where Limehouse is hiding his money.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.038
If you go up to Nobles
looking to rob Ellstin Limehouse,

18:43.122 --> 18:46.166
- you are liable to end up fed to hogs. Yeah.
- To hogs. Yeah, I know.

18:46.250 --> 18:50.295
If I die here or on the moon,
it don't really make a whole lot of difference.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.715
Ellen May, I need your help.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.134
- Okay.
- Take your time.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.766
Limehouse keeps his money
buried under the church.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.853
Ellen May, I am disappointed in you.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.688
What?

19:09.232 --> 19:14.486
Every kid in Harlan grew up hearing
that right there, that little fairytale.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.238
Nobody believes that. Come on.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.616
No, my friend, Trixie,
she saw it with her own eyes, so.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.453
So you need to promise me something.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.206
Okay.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.377
I just want you to promise me that
if you ever find yourself running things,

19:31.295 --> 19:33.129
that you'll make me queen.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.643
Michigan plate.
That'd be a hell of a coincidence.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.312
It's not. Theo Tonin sent them.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.691
- And you know this how?
- They came by my place this morning.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.611
You don't think that's something
you should have told your chief?

19:57.071 --> 19:59.990
What are you talking about? I just told you.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.992
You told me you were doing all right,

20:02.076 --> 20:04.870
that you were drinking too much
but basically getting by.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.080
- You remember that?
- What's your point?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.541
Even under ideal circumstances, Raylan,

20:09.625 --> 20:15.255
the prospect of first-time fatherhood
can make a man feel unmoored.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.257
- "Unmoored"?
- Oh, shut up.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.385
- I'm just feeling my way through this.
- Art, I've already got a daddy.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.638
- Yeah, I've met your daddy.
- Fair enough. Continue.

20:23.723 --> 20:28.977
To be clear, I just don't need you to be
any more reckless than normal. All right?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.604
You really are afraid
of getting shot, aren't you?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.898
Whatever your failings are gonna be
as a father,

20:32.982 --> 20:36.067
I'm pretty sure that your child
is gonna be better off

20:36.152 --> 20:39.154
if you manage to stay aboveground
long enough to make his acquaintance.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.075
We got ourselves a problem.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.952
What, Dickie Bennett's on his way to Hawaii

20:46.037 --> 20:47.579
with his mama's money
on the seat beside him?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.039
No. It ain't Dickie Bennett.

20:49.123 --> 20:52.000
I sent the collection boys out there
to see Parker and Longbaugh

20:52.084 --> 20:53.919
on account of them shorting Arlo last week.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.754
The hell, you say! Shorting on me?

20:55.838 --> 20:58.340
Jesus. It ain't rocket science.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.508
If anybody wants to know
what happened to Delroy,

21:00.593 --> 21:04.262
you just say that he stopped paying
and they best not go down the same road.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.139
It ain't about Delroy, either.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.351
What is it about, Johnny?
What did they do this time?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.895
Nothing. They're dead.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.819
He wasn't there.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.156
I never told you he'd be there.
I told you that was the last place I saw him.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.950
But there was someone there, though.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.244
And I told you, he went there
to face off with a US Marshal.

21:28.371 --> 21:31.164
Yeah, but you didn't tell us
the marshal lived upstairs.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.540
You know, if I didn't know any better,

21:32.625 --> 21:35.168
I'd think you sent us there
expecting him to take care of us.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.380
Or you'd take care of him,
have to go on the run, either way.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.925
A man doesn't talk like that
unless he's holding the nuts.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.430
It's nothing personal.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.307
I just figured the more soldiers
Quarles has down here,

21:49.392 --> 21:51.351
the more tenuous my position becomes.

21:51.435 --> 21:55.397
Did you figure if you didn't put us
together with him, we'd just go away?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.941
I figured it would buy me some time
to cut a deal.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.569
Help you in exchange for a guarantee
that I don't get left out in the cold.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.491
Well, how about you help us in exchange...

22:08.661 --> 22:10.453
In exchange for your lives?

22:11.205 --> 22:14.249
That sounds a little odd
coming from the guy not holding the gun.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.752
Did you help Quarles
because of the guns he had

22:17.837 --> 22:19.713
or because of who was behind him?

22:20.798 --> 22:25.343
Theo Tonin,
he carries this ear around in his pocket.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.722
- I'm sorry. It sounded like you said...
- Yeah, yeah. It's a human ear.

22:28.806 --> 22:34.561
And whenever he wants
to get some guy's attention,

22:34.645 --> 22:38.106
he just takes out the ear
and he starts talking into it.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.191
What does he say?

22:40.276 --> 22:42.610
I don't think it really matters.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.115
- Jimmy, where's that neighbor lady?
- Collection boys are sitting on her.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.867
You sure she didn't call this in?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.827
Well, if she had, you got to think,
at the very least,

22:50.911 --> 22:53.997
we'd have a squad car out here by now,
even in Harlan.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.707
Go get her.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.878
As if our protection business
wasn't already halfway down the shitter.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.212
Boyd, this is not good.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.631
Johnny, check the closets
underneath the sink.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.717
See if you can't find any household cleaners.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.010
Why?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.721
Well, he poured bleach
over everything he touched.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.515
I'd like to know if he found that bleach here
or he brought it with him.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.059
What the hell difference does that make?

23:14.143 --> 23:16.728
Well, if he brought it with him, he is a pro,

23:16.812 --> 23:19.230
not some tweaker
pulling a crime of opportunity. Go.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.782
Ma'am, I am so sorry.
I was hoping to spare you this sight.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.158
Oh, glad you didn't.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.119
At my age, I got to take my pleasures
where I can find them.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.370
Meaning?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.706
Meaning I'm tickled
to see these two sumbitches dead.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.459
Hope they suffered some first.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.629
Well, I suppose that explains
why you didn't call the police.

23:42.713 --> 23:47.258
Police didn't do shit when these two
killed one of my dogs last year, Togo.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.220
Used to bark at all
the late-night comings and goings.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.765
Come outside one morning,
found him shot dead in my yard.

23:53.849 --> 23:54.974
That's awful to hear.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.228
Togo got them back, though.

23:58.813 --> 24:00.897
Togo did? Your dead dog?

24:01.607 --> 24:03.316
Who else we talking about?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.444
Well, how did Togo do that?
How did he get them back?

24:06.570 --> 24:09.697
I know it was him sent
that husky-looking fella to do this here.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.784
- You saw the man who did this?
- That's correct.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.453
- He was heavyset?
- Wouldn't have called him skinny.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.622
But you did say he was husky-looking.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.042
He was. Looked like a husky.
You know, sled dog?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.378
It was the eyes.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.881
Even from across the street,
I could see them, just like a husky's.

24:26.966 --> 24:31.219
But the man you saw,
the husky-looking fella that Togo sent...

24:32.138 --> 24:34.722
Bluest eyes I ever saw.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.352
We got it. You said, "Go figure it out."
Did you not? And what'd I do?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.896
I went ahead
and I figured the hell out of it, man.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.984
See, what I did is, I was like,
"Wait a second, now. Ellen May."

24:46.402 --> 24:49.779
- I'm thinking she's got to have...
- Dickie, what'd you find?

24:52.700 --> 24:56.369
Limehouse hides his money

24:57.997 --> 25:00.999
beneath the floorboards buried in the dirt

25:01.083 --> 25:03.751
underneath Nobles church.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.840
<i>How about them apples, huh?</i>

25:08.924 --> 25:11.342
<i>You know, I think
I'm gonna need me a bear hug.</i>

25:11.427 --> 25:13.386
<i>- I'm sorry, Dickie.
- Bring it in.</i>

25:13.470 --> 25:14.846
<i>I'm greedy.</i>

25:15.806 --> 25:17.473
I'm not suicidal.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.604
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Rodney.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.190
We had ourselves a deal, man.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.776
<i>This ain't the Rodney I know. Come on.</i>

25:30.529 --> 25:33.281
I thought I had a brother in you, man.

25:36.160 --> 25:41.206
You know, Mama always said you had
the balls of a man about half your size.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.670
Out of respect for your late mother,

25:48.797 --> 25:50.506
I'm gonna let that one go.

25:50.591 --> 25:51.716
My advice?

25:52.468 --> 25:56.888
Call Limehouse, get your cooler full of cash
and get out of here!

25:59.266 --> 26:00.725
Let's go.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.314
You federal Stormtroopers
get what you needed?

26:06.398 --> 26:09.859
Yes, Mr. Dunham,
and on behalf of a grateful nation...

26:10.152 --> 26:11.277
Go to hell.

26:11.362 --> 26:14.781
...the Marshals Service would like
to thank you for your troubles.

26:16.617 --> 26:17.992
Mr. Napier.

26:21.205 --> 26:24.290
It's Sheriff Napier, least until next week,

26:24.375 --> 26:26.834
which means you two
are in some seriously deep shit.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.754
Well, I'd be less concerned
about the shit we're in

26:29.838 --> 26:32.048
and more concerned about
what you're gonna have to do to stay alive

26:32.132 --> 26:33.841
till your term ends.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.677
You don't scare me.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.972
I ain't some half-wit gun thug
that you think you can just...

26:41.350 --> 26:45.144
Just so we're clear,
I ain't some half-wit gun thug, neither.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.854
What do you want?

26:47.773 --> 26:52.193
Robert Quarles just killed two men
under my protection.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.570
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.657
Whether he did it out of spite or stupidity,
I'm not sure.

26:57.741 --> 27:01.744
But what I am sure of is that you're the one
who told him who to hit.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.289
I didn't have nothing to do with that.

27:04.373 --> 27:08.876
Just like I'm sure you're gonna be the one
to tell me how to find him.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.134
You want to count it?

27:16.218 --> 27:20.471
No. Not if it's still adding up
to 46 and change or whatever.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.265
What made you change your mind?

27:22.349 --> 27:23.349
All right, gentlemen.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.977
We have reason to believe
this money represents ill-gotten gains

27:26.061 --> 27:28.146
and is therefore seizable
by the Marshals Service

27:28.230 --> 27:31.274
under Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 46
of the US legal code.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.278
That right there, that would be my money.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.362
You want it back,

27:36.447 --> 27:39.324
all you got to do is show a court
the legal means by which you obtained it.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.785
May I go?

27:42.870 --> 27:45.580
No, actually, I'm afraid you both
are gonna have to stay with us

27:45.664 --> 27:47.498
while we wait for a warrant
to go up into Nobles.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.877
Wouldn't want you to be tempted
to tip your friends we were coming.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.482
Have a seat. I'll handle this.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.531
Hey.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.256
US Marshals.
Get your hands where I can see them.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.509
Step to the car.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.054
You know, there was a day when I
would have said nobody could stealth me.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.389
Yeah? What happened?

28:44.473 --> 28:47.141
Lose your edge or just realize
you weren't that good to begin with?

28:47.476 --> 28:48.726
Maybe a little of both.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.021
Sooner or later, old age humbles us all.

28:52.106 --> 28:55.691
- Look at that, concealed weapon.
- That's not good for a convicted felon.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.736
- What, did you pull my rap sheet?
- Educated guess.

28:58.821 --> 29:02.031
- You want to tell us what's going on here?
- Why don't you be more specific?

29:02.116 --> 29:03.866
Is Quarles in that apartment?

29:08.038 --> 29:11.040
Why don't you guys just walk away,
let nature take its course?

29:11.166 --> 29:13.209
Yeah, why don't you shut the hell up?

29:13.293 --> 29:14.752
Not like the world wouldn't be a better place.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.295
This is not Detroit.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.174
Don't say I didn't warn you.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.560
- Why would he go to Harlan?
- I told you.

29:31.562 --> 29:35.148
He barely speaks to me.
Now, please let me go.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.782
Come here. Come here.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.284
US Marshals! Put that weapon down!

29:46.368 --> 29:48.286
- Hands behind your head!
- Put the weapon down.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.455
- I'm walking out of here.
- No, that ain't gonna happen.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.957
- You want to see this kid's insides?
- That ain't gonna happen, either.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.043
Give me a chance to get to my gun.
Maybe this could be our time.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.922
- My leg, God damn it!
- On your bellies! Hands behind your head!

30:00.007 --> 30:01.674
- Where's Quarles?
- He's not here!

30:01.758 --> 30:04.760
- Move! Where is he? Where's Quarles?
- What do you mean?

30:04.845 --> 30:07.972
- I mean, where is he?
- I don't know!

30:08.056 --> 30:10.766
- I thought he'd be here, damn it.
- He told you he'd be here?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.393
Why would he tell us anything?

30:12.478 --> 30:14.729
You work for the man. Do you not?

30:15.439 --> 30:16.898
Where do you get this from?

30:22.154 --> 30:25.156
Theo Tonin sent a couple of guys
down here to take out the trash.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.450
You don't think that's something
you might have mentioned before?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.703
You ever get the feeling
God's laughing at you?

30:30.787 --> 30:31.829
Why?

30:31.914 --> 30:34.332
Just 'cause we shot the guy
that's looking to kill the guy

30:34.416 --> 30:35.750
that you're just dying to see dead?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.217
You don't say much, do you?

30:45.260 --> 30:46.677
Mr. Quarles.

30:51.475 --> 30:55.102
Dare I even hope that you have come
to settle your tab?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.355
Actually, I'm looking for a place
to lay low for a while.

30:57.439 --> 31:02.693
Lay low while you figure a way
to square things with your friends in Detroit?

31:02.778 --> 31:05.363
Is that a guess? 'Cause that's a good one.

31:05.447 --> 31:09.367
You know, I think we could see clear
to extend our hospitality.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.828
But that would put you critically in our debt.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.164
- You see that?
- Of course.

31:16.124 --> 31:22.964
You also see that it is not wise
to let a man get so far into debt

31:23.173 --> 31:28.970
without insisting
he first settle the debt already owed.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.639
Thank you kindly.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.566
Well, that's a good start.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.901
When you think I'm gonna be getting
the rest of it?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.152
Bag's not empty yet.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.196
Do I look like a drug dealer to you?

31:49.491 --> 31:52.285
That's pretty smart,
holding all your meetings in a place like this.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.162
The smell of blood in the air.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.958
Plus, it gives you an excuse
to hold a knife in your hand.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.006
There's no knife in my hand now,
Mr. Quarles.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.645
Now, you seem like a resourceful man.

32:19.730 --> 32:23.107
I'm sure you'll find a way
to turn that bag into something

32:23.191 --> 32:24.984
I'd happily take off your hands.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.528
And when you do,
you know where to find me.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.166
- Good day, Mr. Limehouse.
- Mr. Quarles.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.926
Sheriff. This is kismet.
I was just about to call you.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.511
Is that a fact? How come?

32:52.596 --> 32:56.515
Well, it turns out I need a place
to unload the spoils of my earlier endeavors.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.683
Why I called.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.894
- You have an idea for me?
- I do.

32:59.978 --> 33:05.316
But I want to make sure after I tell you,
I don't ever hear from your sorry ass again.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.570
Sheriff, trust me.
The pleasure will be all mine.

33:10.113 --> 33:14.283
All right. There's a whorehouse,
but they also deal to the johns.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.410
They ought to be able
to take whatever you got.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.663
It's called Audrey's.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.248
Audrey's. Bye-bye.

33:26.463 --> 33:30.758
All right, you got 30 seconds.
I'm on vacation. I'm having a sandwich.

33:31.385 --> 33:35.680
Mr. Tonin, I wanted to just make sure
you were aware of the situation down here.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.598
You mean that my guys
got snatched by the Marshals

33:37.683 --> 33:40.226
before they could get to Quarles?
Yeah, I'm aware of it.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.602
<i>What's your name, again?</i>

33:42.437 --> 33:43.938
- Duffy, sir.
<i>- Duffy.</i>

33:44.189 --> 33:46.899
Duffy, yeah. I think I remember
my son Sammy mentioning you.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.696
I'm glad to hear that.
Sammy's an impressive young man.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.114
He's a moron.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.448
<i>What do you want?</i>

33:55.117 --> 33:58.786
Well, I was wondering, sir, do you intend
on sending more men down here to...

33:58.870 --> 34:01.956
To kill Bobby Quarles?
Yeah, I plan on sending more.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.749
I loved him like a son.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.002
<i>But he wasted my money,
he threatened my actual son.</i>

34:07.087 --> 34:10.715
- And that other shit. Jesus.
<i>- Well, that's the thing, sir.</i>

34:11.967 --> 34:13.967
I don't know if your money has been wasted.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.054
Bobby was onto something down here,
and just because he's gone off track,

34:18.139 --> 34:20.975
no reason to turn your back
on the whole thing.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.271
So, when Quarles is gone,
you want to step up. Is that about right?

34:25.355 --> 34:26.563
Yes.

34:26.648 --> 34:27.815
No.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.650
- Okay. May I ask why, sir?
<i>- I don't know you.</i>

34:31.610 --> 34:33.112
I'll tell you what.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.657
You deliver Quarles,
show me you can get things done.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.244
<i>Price I gave those other assholes
was $100,000 dead,</i>

34:40.328 --> 34:46.000
$200,000 if Sammy gets a chance to talk
to him about putting a gun in his face.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.170
You know Bobby like I do,
you'll settle for the hundred.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.091
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Tonin.
I'll be in touch.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.426
You hope.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.305
Hi!

35:00.307 --> 35:01.682
Oh, honey!

35:02.225 --> 35:03.934
Think we're about to have us some fun.

35:04.019 --> 35:07.146
Don't you think he looks like that guy,
from the butterfly movie?

35:07.230 --> 35:08.481
The one about the time traveler?

35:08.565 --> 35:12.067
No! The one about the, like,
prison island or whatever.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.445
Ladies, as much as I would love
to get to the bottom

35:14.529 --> 35:16.113
of who it is that you think that I look like

35:16.198 --> 35:18.949
and all the kinds of fun
that we could be having together,

35:19.034 --> 35:21.452
the reason that I'm here is 'cause
the Mongoloid tending bar inside

35:21.536 --> 35:23.871
said this is the place where I could find
the guy who runs the joint.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.040
Wait a second.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.750
No, no, no. Don't you go anywhere.

35:27.834 --> 35:28.876
Where the hell have you been?

35:29.002 --> 35:31.504
I've spent the last two hours as a guest
of the US Marshals Service.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.630
<i>Let me guess.</i>

35:32.714 --> 35:36.133
Our friend Deputy Givens has been tangling
with a couple of Detroit's finest.

35:36.218 --> 35:37.259
How is it you know that?

35:37.344 --> 35:40.012
I saw him bracing one in front
of my building, guy named Sarno.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.974
It's nice to know at least that Theo
cares enough to send the very best.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.059
Did you give them my address?

35:45.560 --> 35:48.395
- Didn't see as I had much choice.
<i>- I don't blame you.</i>

35:48.647 --> 35:50.648
I know Sarno. He gets people to talk.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.359
The only thing anyone's telling him
at the moment

35:53.443 --> 35:54.944
is, "You have the right to remain silent."

35:55.612 --> 35:58.781
Well. I'll have to thank Deputy Givens
when I see him next.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.909
I thought you were gonna kill him
next time you see him.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.078
What's the price they put on my head?

36:04.371 --> 36:05.454
They didn't say.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.210
Strip him.

36:14.923 --> 36:18.300
Keep that chain long.
Try to keep him from shitting the bed.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.636
I trust when he wakes up,
you ladies will find a way

36:20.720 --> 36:24.056
to keep him from thinking
about how to escape his predicament.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.684
- Yes, sir.
- Hello? Anyone there?

36:26.768 --> 36:27.852
Who is this?

36:27.936 --> 36:32.356
My name is not your concern,
Mr. Wynn Duffy.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.860
Your concern is for the fate
of the man whose phone this is.

36:35.986 --> 36:38.237
Is he alive? It was hard to tell.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.866
Oh, he's alive.
Do you want him to stay that way?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.702
You know, that's a very good question,
Mr. Crowder.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.288
Well, I don't believe I told you my name.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.500
It's not hard to put together the pieces
of that particular jigsaw puzzle.

36:53.378 --> 36:57.047
Well, I hear my guest here
is worth some money. How much?

36:57.465 --> 36:59.008
$100,000 dead, $200,000 alive.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.677
Well, I suppose a clever man
might underreport that bounty,

37:01.761 --> 37:04.847
trying to keep a bigger share
than what he gives his partner.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.098
Are we partners now?

37:06.182 --> 37:07.474
Well, as far as this goes.

37:08.894 --> 37:13.439
Mr. Duffy, can I trust you
to find your way down to Harlan?

37:14.983 --> 37:18.193
Yeah, you can trust me
to do that, Mr. Crowder.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.446
Would you say
you'd be willing just to kill him

37:20.530 --> 37:23.032
to eliminate any chance
of his wriggling free?

37:23.116 --> 37:28.245
Well, as we speak, he's unconscious,
being stripped naked and chained to a bed.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.414
I think we can handle him.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.583
Don't say I didn't warn you.

37:32.834 --> 37:36.003
You have to go through this every time?
It's exhausting.

37:36.463 --> 37:39.465
Seems we agree on most of the particulars.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.258
Well, good.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.094
You might get out of here in time
to go join the raid team.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.220
Raid team?

37:45.305 --> 37:47.806
Tim and Rachel got a line
on that missing Bennett money,

37:47.891 --> 37:50.059
already recovered $46,000 of it.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.603
They're just waiting for a warrant for the rest.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.104
What's the warrant for?

37:54.272 --> 37:59.693
This church down in Nobles Holler.
Apparently, it's under the floorboards.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.112
I'll pass.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.282
What do you mean, "pass"?
I need that money, Raylan.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.534
I know, Art,
but there's nothing under that church.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.203
That's an old story.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.621
You find it, then.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.957
Tell you what, I'm gonna go down
to Harlan County

38:13.041 --> 38:16.627
and talk to the outgoing sheriff,
see if he can get us any info on Quarles.

38:17.003 --> 38:22.091
And if, along the way, I trip over $3 million,
I'll bring it back to you.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.177
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

38:26.721 --> 38:27.930
Good to go.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.354
- Now you can go.
- Oh, no, no, no.

38:35.438 --> 38:38.190
Now you can go. We insist.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.902
Don't tell me you're fool enough
to believe there's money under the church.

38:42.404 --> 38:47.825
I told you, man. We got this on...
It's, like, stone-cold eyewitness authority.

38:47.909 --> 38:52.121
Then your stone-cold eyewitness
authority is either lying or old.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.164
Limehouse hasn't used the church in years.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.084
Well, then what is he using now?

38:57.252 --> 38:59.169
What makes you think I'd tell you?

39:00.380 --> 39:04.466
I think that you would tell me
because you want me to help you

39:04.551 --> 39:08.554
get yourself a real sweet,
piece of my money, man.

39:08.638 --> 39:12.391
I don't really see any other reason for you
to be standing around here talking to me.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.476
Man won't let us change with the times.

39:16.104 --> 39:19.356
Think you might have had experience
dealing with someone like that yourself.

39:19.441 --> 39:22.985
So, where's my money, man?

39:25.321 --> 39:27.823
Are you really willing
to go all the way on this?

39:28.074 --> 39:30.576
Have you been paying attention, man?

39:30.660 --> 39:36.373
I would rather die trying to get it
than die because I don't have it, man.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.625
All right, then.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.335
We're gonna need a crew.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.379
Can't use anyone from the Nobles.

39:42.630 --> 39:46.884
They'll stay with me once Limehouse is gone,
but they won't go against him directly.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.677
Don't tell me you want me
to call Rodney, man.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.972
- No. No. No.
- That's the last thing I want.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.143
We're gonna need someone
with particular skills.

39:59.481 --> 40:04.318
Sounds to me
like you have someone in mind.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.278
I do.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.572
And I guarantee you ain't gonna like it.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.203
His initials are "Boyd Crowder."
